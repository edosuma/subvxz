00:35.806 --> 00:37.300
Hey, what time is it?

00:39.027 --> 00:40.786
Oh, no.

00:40.888 --> 00:43.567
Oh, no-no-no. You're not
supposed to be here.

00:43.567 --> 00:45.282
Oh, that's not the deal.

00:45.282 --> 00:48.244
- Come on, K, we don't have a deal.
- We have a deal.

00:48.244 --> 00:50.286
We most definitely have a deal.

00:50.286 --> 00:52.505
- There is no sex, ever.
- Oh, come on.

00:52.505 --> 00:55.049
And though we do have sex
doesn't spin the night.

00:56.440 --> 01:01.623
All right, you know what? As much as i'd love
to stay and discuss the *** points of our deal,

01:01.842 --> 01:04.882
I have to go. 
I have a huge meeting.

01:05.415 --> 01:08.098
- Hey, have a great first day back.
- I hate you.

01:08.291 --> 01:09.698
I'll call you.

01:10.616 --> 01:12.977
Oh, you're such a lawyer.

01:28.476 --> 01:29.534
Sorry.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.424
Didn't want ********.

01:33.376 --> 01:34.762
Mission accomplished.

01:47.203 --> 01:49.294
Hi! Can I help you with something?

01:49.294 --> 01:51.635
Is that your boat in slip 41?

01:51.635 --> 01:54.474
It is now. It was my dad's,
Terry Reed.

01:54.474 --> 01:55.734
Did you know him?

01:55.734 --> 01:58.340
- My wife and I, we're new here.
- Oh, yeah?

01:59.182 --> 02:01.815
Sorry. Well, even if you weren't,
you know,

02:02.005 --> 02:03.626
he didn't sail very often.

02:03.626 --> 02:07.705
If you don't wanna give people a wrong 
impression, you really should change the name.

02:07.705 --> 02:09.882
What's the bad luck to change
the boat's name?

02:11.507 --> 02:12.347
Bitch.

02:12.894 --> 02:15.689
- Did you just call me...?
- Anyway, I like it. You know, it was my idea.

02:15.689 --> 02:17.975
He was lonely, and then he met
somebody,

02:17.975 --> 02:19.632
and then the boat was lonely.

02:19.975 --> 02:22.581
So... Anyway, have a good day!

02:25.402 --> 02:27.254
Welcome aboard.

02:53.868 --> 02:55.043
Hey, Spencer.

02:55.043 --> 02:57.493
Lauren's been trying to call
you all morning.

02:57.493 --> 02:59.546
Really? I just turned my phone on.

02:59.742 --> 03:03.983
Kate, if she's called me, she's
probably called you at least 10 times.

03:03.983 --> 03:05.946
You know, what if
there is an emergency?

03:05.946 --> 03:09.496
I'm a mediator, I don't have emergencies.
At least, not professionally.

03:09.496 --> 03:13.458
Look, she's calling me again on the other
line. Could you, please, call her back?

03:13.458 --> 03:16.082
She's a bit obsessive, our stepmother,
don't you think?

03:16.082 --> 03:17.336
That's what dad loved.

03:17.336 --> 03:18.918
- I thought it was her ass.
- That, too.

03:18.918 --> 03:24.047
Speaking of dad, what are we gonna do with
these ashes? Are we gonna have a ceremony?

03:25.401 --> 03:28.271
I don't know. Lauren's got 'em.
Ask her.

03:28.550 --> 03:31.417
I'll just give her some time.
It's only been a week.

03:31.418 --> 03:34.283
Now, what about you? Are you sure about
going back to work already?

03:34.283 --> 03:36.320
Well, I kinda owe it to dad.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.045
You know, it's his firm, but
it's your life.

03:39.045 --> 03:41.616
Yeah, but those things are really
connected.

03:41.616 --> 03:43.865
Look, I gotta go to Debbie's crime.
Good luck today.

03:44.032 --> 03:46.745
- All right.
- Don't forget to call Lauren.

03:47.620 --> 03:48.518
- Oh, you know me. Hi.
- Hi.

03:48.518 --> 03:50.101
- Coffee, black, please.
- Sure.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.998
- Gimme the money.
- Okay.

03:53.999 --> 03:55.992
Gimme the money!

03:55.993 --> 03:57.693
Okay, okay, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Come on!

03:58.225 --> 03:59.385
Screw you, pal!

03:59.386 --> 04:00.881
Screw me? Screw you!

04:01.148 --> 04:02.239
Okay. Hold on a second.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.577
Just take it easy. Take it easy.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.790
Just put the gun down, 'cause you
don't wanna hurt anybody, all right?

04:09.171 --> 04:10.609
How's that coffee comin' along?

04:11.057 --> 04:13.227
Um...You seem like the kinda guy

04:13.228 --> 04:14.498
who knows what he's doing.

04:15.860 --> 04:17.045
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:17.046 --> 04:19.529
Yeah. Okay, so, uh...

04:19.531 --> 04:21.392
We're not gonna have any
problems here, right?

04:21.696 --> 04:22.753
Yeah. No.

04:22.754 --> 04:24.072
Right. Okay, good.

04:24.073 --> 04:27.218
So just tuck the gun
back under your shirt,

04:27.538 --> 04:30.057
'cause you don't want
someone to walk by,

04:30.058 --> 04:31.712
and then they see you and...

04:32.517 --> 04:33.743
Right?

04:34.267 --> 04:35.642
How we doing on that coffee?

04:38.198 --> 04:41.208
Good. Now, educate me.

04:41.209 --> 04:42.887
What do you get when
you rob a store?

04:43.304 --> 04:46.032
You...You know, money.

04:46.432 --> 04:48.909
Right. How much? Gimme a number.

04:49.176 --> 04:52.489
- 500 bucks?
- Yeah, right! 5... Forget it, man!

04:52.490 --> 04:54.651
Let's just say 100. All right?

04:54.768 --> 04:55.840
You get shot...

04:56.299 --> 04:58.016
The emergency room is
gonna cost you a grand.

04:58.017 --> 04:59.865
So just give the guy 100 bucks.

04:59.866 --> 05:01.250
- I'm gonna give him something.
- Wait, wait, wait.

05:01.251 --> 05:02.517
Hold on a second.
Hold on, hold on.

05:03.879 --> 05:05.355
What are you gonna
buy with the money?

05:05.519 --> 05:06.655
Beer.

05:07.227 --> 05:09.963
And, uh... beef jerky.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.067
Beer and jerky. Nice.
That's a balanced meal.

05:13.210 --> 05:15.216
So how much does...

05:15.609 --> 05:17.941
Let's say 50 bucks of
beer and jerky cost you?

05:19.349 --> 05:23.052
- 17.50.
- 7... 17.50?

05:23.669 --> 05:25.067
Are you kidding me?

05:25.280 --> 05:26.594
- Who's robbing who?
- Hey, come on!

05:26.595 --> 05:28.203
All right, fine, fine, fine.

05:28.204 --> 05:32.640
So how does 50 bucks of
beer and jerky sound to you?

05:33.246 --> 05:35.502
I mean, I assume you're
gonna be running, right?

05:35.503 --> 05:38.153
- So that's all you can carry.
- That's... Yeah, okay.

05:38.307 --> 05:40.687
Okay, good. So...

05:41.058 --> 05:42.973
17.50 wholesale...

05:43.420 --> 05:44.897
And we go on with our day.

05:46.071 --> 05:48.102
- Yeah.
- Yes?

05:48.103 --> 05:50.388
And my coffee, right?
You're gonna get my coffee.

05:50.389 --> 05:51.435
- Yeah, yeah.
- Great.

05:52.545 --> 05:54.015
Okay, good.

05:55.852 --> 05:57.094
Black.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.907
Okay. There you go. And, uh...

06:00.949 --> 06:03.540
How 'bout this? Good. Okay?

06:04.150 --> 06:06.260
- Ha ha!
- All right.

06:10.914 --> 06:12.478
You're welcome.

06:17.851 --> 06:20.765
Hey, hey, hey, that... that's 5.75.

06:23.238 --> 06:25.077
For coffee and a cookie?

06:26.380 --> 06:28.003
Those are organic.

06:34.564 --> 06:36.876
- Spencer.
- Did you call Lauren?

06:36.877 --> 06:38.506
- Nope. I got held up.
- Kate...

06:38.507 --> 06:39.822
- Gotta go. Love you!
- Kate!

06:57.319 --> 06:59.669
Ah...Leo, my Leo. Good morning.

06:59.670 --> 07:00.917
Welcome back. You look great.

07:00.918 --> 07:03.141
Oh, what can I say?
Grief suits me.

07:03.142 --> 07:05.098
Yeah. Oh, you should try this.

07:05.099 --> 07:07.100
It's apple chai tea infusion.

07:07.101 --> 07:09.177
Eew. I hate those
girly drinks, Leo.

07:09.178 --> 07:11.248
Your loss. It's appletastic.

07:11.249 --> 07:14.053
Uh, judge Nicastro's
office called.

07:14.219 --> 07:16.250
You're expected in
his court at 11:30.

07:16.251 --> 07:17.836
- He's got a case for you.
- Doesn't judge Nicastro know

07:17.837 --> 07:19.066
I'm not a practicing
attorney anymore?

07:19.067 --> 07:21.457
It's a mediation.
You were specifically requested.

07:21.738 --> 07:23.298
Okay, that's weird. He hates me.

07:23.672 --> 07:25.515
Yes. Yes, he does.

07:25.516 --> 07:27.748
You're supposed to say, "no,
he doesn't, he loves you."

07:28.175 --> 07:30.251
- Any other calls?
- Lauren.

07:30.446 --> 07:32.081
That bitch just
can't help herself.

07:32.082 --> 07:33.801
- I mean, it's my first day back.
- Kate.

07:33.802 --> 07:35.557
My father is not even
cold in the ground.

07:35.558 --> 07:37.385
- We can't all be obsessive-compulsive...
- Kate!

07:37.386 --> 07:40.209
- Anal retentive...
- Ah!

07:40.503 --> 07:41.957
She's right behind me, isn't she?

07:41.958 --> 07:44.786
Kate. I need you. Now.

07:45.741 --> 07:47.747
Yes. Right. I was just going

07:47.748 --> 07:49.379
over my schedule
here with Leonardo.

07:49.380 --> 07:50.978
- You need me back...
- ASAP.

07:50.979 --> 07:53.906
S-a-p. You have a
tendency to panic.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.934
You have a tendency not to.

07:55.935 --> 07:57.429
Um, now that dad's gone,

07:57.430 --> 07:58.972
are you still my evil stepmother

07:58.973 --> 08:00.869
or just the evil managing partner?

08:01.474 --> 08:03.606
Have you been
to Masa's lately?

08:03.997 --> 08:05.498
- What?
- Boulevard.

08:05.677 --> 08:07.150
Aqua. Gary Danko.

08:07.386 --> 08:09.424
No. I haven't done
much dining out lately.

08:09.425 --> 08:11.311
I've been mourning the
death of my father. You?

08:11.312 --> 08:15.451
Hey. I miss my husband.
Every minute.

08:15.452 --> 08:16.298
But instead of sulking,

08:16.299 --> 08:18.173
I am trying to protect
the firm he loved.

08:18.174 --> 08:19.513
By running up your
expense account?

08:19.514 --> 08:20.875
Oh, grow up, Kate.

08:20.876 --> 08:22.612
Every law firm in San Francisco

08:22.613 --> 08:24.270
is wining and dining our clients,

08:24.271 --> 08:26.172
telling them to jump ship...
and it's working.

08:26.396 --> 08:29.093
Ortho West left for
Morrison Foerster,

08:29.094 --> 08:31.273
the Rixton Group
for Wilson Sonsini,

08:31.341 --> 08:33.464
and Tinker Connelly,
Ird Pallbearer, right side,

08:33.465 --> 08:35.380
dropped us the day...

08:35.609 --> 08:36.938
Of the funeral.

08:36.938 --> 08:38.318
I called his son from the limo

08:38.318 --> 08:39.559
and over drinks at
the Morgan tonight,

08:39.561 --> 08:41.582
I will get that business back.

08:41.582 --> 08:45.128
Teddy Reed is dead.
Reed & Reed is on life support.

08:45.129 --> 08:48.243
I will do whatever it
takes to keep it alive.

08:48.899 --> 08:50.278
What can I do?

08:52.978 --> 08:55.086
You know Charles
and Douglas Pease.

08:55.461 --> 08:58.173
Yeah, sure. Pease, inc.
Women's clothing. They're a big client.

08:58.174 --> 08:58.931
Well, as you know,
they've agreed to

08:58.932 --> 09:00.631
be bought out by a
Canadian company.

09:00.632 --> 09:01.671
Douglas will be in charge.

09:01.672 --> 09:03.640
His father retires with
a generous severance.

09:03.641 --> 09:04.791
So what's the problem?

09:04.792 --> 09:06.590
Well, they were supposed
to sign the contracts today,

09:06.591 --> 09:08.736
but the old man called me this
morning and tried to back out.

09:08.737 --> 09:10.783
No deal for them, no fees for us.

09:10.958 --> 09:13.705
Now, I convinced Charles to come
in and talk it out with Douglas,

09:13.706 --> 09:16.083
but we need those
contracts signed.

09:17.779 --> 09:19.614
Get them on the same page.

09:20.477 --> 09:21.977
That's what I do.

09:24.049 --> 09:27.204
Pastels. Primaries.
Stripes. Solids.

09:27.205 --> 09:29.468
- You have no idea, do you?
- That's not the point, is it?

09:29.469 --> 09:30.916
- Gentlemen...
- You don't know what to think

09:30.917 --> 09:32.411
unless somebody graphs it for you.

09:32.412 --> 09:33.498
- Gentlemen...
- Are you gonna run the company?

09:33.499 --> 09:35.531
No. You're gonna
let bean counters...

09:38.068 --> 09:39.376
Gentlemen...

09:39.377 --> 09:41.067
You know Kate Reed.

09:41.068 --> 09:42.296
Hey, Charlie, Doug.

09:42.297 --> 09:45.050
I'm sorry about your father.
He was a good man. I'll miss him.

09:45.051 --> 09:46.366
Thank you.

09:46.593 --> 09:48.408
- I'll miss him too.
- Thank you so much, Doug.

09:48.409 --> 09:50.009
That's my boy.
Never an original thought.

09:50.010 --> 09:52.152
Since we seem to
be at an impasse,

09:52.153 --> 09:54.835
I thought it might be helpful
if Kate got involved.

09:54.836 --> 09:57.220
We don't need a mediator.
Thanks anyway, Kate.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.985
- I've made my decision.
- Right. I've heard.

09:59.986 --> 10:02.244
It took 14 months to
put this deal together.

10:02.245 --> 10:04.227
He was with it every
step of the way.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.434
This is his deal,
and he won't sign it.

10:06.435 --> 10:08.388
Well, he doesn't have
to if he doesn't want to.

10:08.389 --> 10:10.537
- That's not...
- But...Do you mind just telling me,

10:10.538 --> 10:12.872
Charlie, because this
is so not like you:

10:12.873 --> 10:14.790
What's the story?
Where's your head at?

10:16.244 --> 10:19.366
Spring 1993.
I ordered Capri pants.

10:19.367 --> 10:22.386
Everyone else... the gap,
the limited...

10:22.387 --> 10:23.568
They're all thinking bells.

10:23.569 --> 10:25.300
I cleaned their clocks.
All of them.

10:25.301 --> 10:26.937
That was a fantastic time,
Charles.

10:26.938 --> 10:28.525
What has that got to do with...

10:28.526 --> 10:30.627
The business is
not in your blood.

10:30.628 --> 10:31.626
You don't feel it.

10:31.627 --> 10:34.676
I built the company on
instinct, intuition.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.359
And that's your strength,
Charlie.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.856
And I'm sure that
Doug has his own.

10:38.857 --> 10:40.804
I have my MBA from Stanford.

10:40.805 --> 10:44.198
I make decisions based
on statistical analysis,

10:44.199 --> 10:45.679
- trend-spotting.
- Pie charts.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.994
We've had ten consecutive
losing quarters.

10:47.995 --> 10:50.094
We blame the economy,
and so far everyone believes us.

10:50.095 --> 10:51.523
But it's been a long time, dad,

10:51.524 --> 10:53.187
- since you've cleaned anyone's clock.
- Okay

10:53.188 --> 10:54.970
okay, clearly you two
approach things differently,

10:54.971 --> 10:56.727
but here's the part
that I don't understand.

10:56.886 --> 10:58.590
That was true 14 months ago

10:58.591 --> 11:01.086
when you started
negotiating this buyout.

11:01.087 --> 11:03.313
It was true a week ago,
and it was true yesterday.

11:03.686 --> 11:05.269
So what changed?

11:06.596 --> 11:08.642
- Tell her about last night.
- It has nothing to do with...

11:08.643 --> 11:10.428
- It's about judgment, Douglas.
- Please, dad.

11:10.429 --> 11:13.639
Okay, hold on. Hold on, Charlie.
What happened?

11:15.036 --> 11:19.268
I was coming home from
dinner with clients.

11:19.424 --> 11:21.716
I was on the 280 heading south.

11:21.812 --> 11:23.212
I'd just got on the bridge.

11:23.213 --> 11:26.654
A red sedan crossed over
the line and bumped me.

11:28.605 --> 11:29.870
What the hell?

11:29.871 --> 11:34.023
Whatcha gonna say now?
Whatcha gotta say?

11:44.918 --> 11:46.459
I don't remember the impact.

11:46.460 --> 11:48.767
It was instinct, you know,
turning away from the gun.

11:49.018 --> 11:50.946
I didn't...See them at all.

11:50.947 --> 11:54.046
- It just happened so fast.
- Did anyone I.D. the sedan?

11:54.220 --> 11:55.788
Well, a good
samaritan called it in,

11:55.789 --> 11:57.180
and there's a second witness.

11:57.181 --> 11:59.435
The driver and gunman
are in custody.

11:59.843 --> 12:01.908
Now, if we go
through this buyout...

12:02.325 --> 12:06.140
We have to disclose the details
of any pending legal action.

12:06.141 --> 12:07.727
Well, someone
pointed a gun at him.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.195
- He's blameless.
- He was drunk.

12:10.196 --> 12:12.957
Douglas had a blood alcohol
level that was elevated.

12:12.958 --> 12:14.500
- .09.
- Drunk.

12:14.501 --> 12:17.064
I had two glasses of wine.
That's not why I crashed.

12:17.065 --> 12:18.503
The courts aren't
gonna see it that way.

12:18.504 --> 12:19.990
- Of course they're not.
- And that's exactly why

12:19.991 --> 12:21.267
you don't want this
to go to court.

12:21.268 --> 12:23.949
So how do we put these thugs in
jail and clean up Doug's mess?

12:24.091 --> 12:25.997
Charlie, I was an
attorney for five years.

12:26.171 --> 12:28.798
I quit to become a mediator.
You wanna know why?

12:29.156 --> 12:32.305
In court, somebody wins,
but there's always a loser.

12:32.306 --> 12:34.004
And it doesn't necessarily
have to do with

12:34.005 --> 12:36.247
who's right and who's wrong.
Now, if we go to court,

12:36.248 --> 12:38.665
this is gonna limp through
the system for 18 months

12:38.666 --> 12:41.764
and all the while, Doug's DUI
is gonna become public record,

12:41.765 --> 12:43.740
which is exactly
what you don't want.

12:43.741 --> 12:45.382
I'm not just gonna
stand by and do nothing.

12:45.383 --> 12:48.025
Okay, the kids in the car...
that's an open and shut case.

12:48.026 --> 12:49.653
The system's gonna
take care of them.

12:49.654 --> 12:51.950
They'll probably be offered
some kind of plea bargain.

12:52.134 --> 12:54.570
Our only concern is Doug's DUI.

12:54.571 --> 12:56.850
We handle that, the deal
can move forward, right?

12:57.210 --> 12:58.544
Absolutely.

13:00.067 --> 13:01.449
Charles?

13:02.546 --> 13:05.141
Great. So we're all
back on the same page.

13:05.142 --> 13:06.832
Win-win. And you know what?

13:06.833 --> 13:10.576
Kate has a unique connection
to the d.A.'S office.

13:10.577 --> 13:12.946
I am sure she'd be
happy to use it.

13:12.947 --> 13:15.315
Especially for such
important clients like you.

13:15.809 --> 13:17.728
Lauren, may I have a
word with you, please?

13:19.654 --> 13:21.307
Excuse us, gentlemen.

13:25.587 --> 13:27.734
My father would never
ask me to do this.

13:27.901 --> 13:29.271
No, you're right. He wouldn't.

13:29.272 --> 13:31.275
He'd ask me to ask you.

13:31.276 --> 13:34.236
It's business, Kate.
We use what we have.

13:34.374 --> 13:36.802
Our clients can go anywhere
for legal services.

13:36.803 --> 13:38.456
Hell, they can get half of what
they need off the Internet.

13:38.457 --> 13:40.635
They come to us for
our connections.

13:40.636 --> 13:43.510
You have one. We're using it.

13:45.879 --> 13:48.010
Just do something with
my father's ashes.

13:59.937 --> 14:03.114
- Coffee. Black, three sugars.
- You're forgiven.

14:04.527 --> 14:06.403
- Where ya goin'?
- Hell.

14:18.539 --> 14:21.333
He wasn't driving erratically
or over the speed limit.

14:21.334 --> 14:23.576
In fact, the legality
of a sobriety test,

14:23.577 --> 14:27.479
given the circumstances,
is questionable at best.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.870
- You missed me.
- That's not why I'm here.

14:29.871 --> 14:31.033
Well, you could have called.

14:31.101 --> 14:32.602
- Lauren asked me to...
- Yeah, I know.

14:32.603 --> 14:34.885
But you could have called.
Instead, you came over.

14:34.886 --> 14:35.975
Because it's important.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.784
Because you feel
guilty about last night.

14:37.785 --> 14:40.296
Why would I feel
guilty about last night?

14:40.297 --> 14:42.108
Oh, you're saying you're not
here because you feel guilty?

14:42.109 --> 14:43.479
Yes. That's exactly
what I'm saying.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.967
- So you miss me.
- You're such a dick.

14:47.507 --> 14:49.123
All right.
You're gonna like this.

14:50.696 --> 14:52.781
Your gunman's got
an extensive record.

14:52.947 --> 14:54.674
Pointing a firearm at another driver

14:54.675 --> 14:56.842
from a moving vehicle's
a class a felony.

14:56.843 --> 14:58.220
- He's gonna do ten years.
- Can I see?

14:58.221 --> 15:01.311
No, no, no. Ha.
Attorneys only. Sorry.

15:01.474 --> 15:04.554
The driver's also looking
at ten reducible to five.

15:04.949 --> 15:06.623
Well, those are stiff sentences.

15:06.624 --> 15:09.103
- My client will be happy.
- Pretty standard stuff, actually.

15:09.260 --> 15:11.611
There's the possibility of
catastrophic loss of life.

15:11.612 --> 15:13.783
The vehicle itself is a weapon.

15:13.784 --> 15:15.429
The gun compounds the threat.

15:15.430 --> 15:17.129
The law was designed
to keep gangbangers

15:17.130 --> 15:18.333
from taking their
beefs on the road.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.162
And what about my guy's DUI?

15:20.772 --> 15:23.251
Well...He's got no priors.

15:23.252 --> 15:27.024
Given the circumstances,
a good lawyer should get it thrown out.

15:27.241 --> 15:28.761
Let's assume he has a good lawyer.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.811
Ha. Cute.

15:31.313 --> 15:33.772
Okay. We're done.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.279
This wasn't just business,
was it, huh?

15:37.280 --> 15:39.316
Come on, be honest, Kate.
This was about us.

15:39.467 --> 15:42.765
Justin... I'm always honest.

15:43.252 --> 15:45.105
It's my greatest flaw.

15:46.757 --> 15:48.104
Well, it's one of them. Yeah.

15:48.260 --> 15:50.047
Remind me again why our
marriage didn't work.

15:50.048 --> 15:52.548
Ah. Just did.

15:52.615 --> 15:54.720
I was joking, Kate.
I was kidding.

15:55.559 --> 15:56.763
Kate.

15:57.938 --> 15:59.765
I was kidding. Wait.

16:00.396 --> 16:03.058
Okay, I get it.
You're angry. I'm sorry.

16:03.346 --> 16:04.612
This looks familiar.

16:04.613 --> 16:06.581
I apologize.

16:06.866 --> 16:11.523
- Not accepted. Nope.
- I'm sorry, Kate. I apologize.

16:11.918 --> 16:13.972
Really familiar.

16:15.198 --> 16:17.267
Could you get her
on the phone, please?

16:23.194 --> 16:24.179
Talk to me, Leo.

16:24.180 --> 16:25.804
Hey, don't be late
for judge Nicastro.

16:25.805 --> 16:28.078
- He hates to be kept waiting.
- Oh, give me a little credit.

16:28.079 --> 16:29.630
We'll get right outside
of his courtroom.

16:29.808 --> 16:31.342
Taxi!

16:35.744 --> 16:36.897
[]

16:44.486 --> 16:46.709
Sorry! I'm sorry.

16:46.710 --> 16:49.553
Judge, I am so sorry.
Really sorry about this.

16:49.645 --> 16:51.347
No, you're not.
You're Kate Reed.

16:51.348 --> 16:53.518
You have nothing but
disdain for the law.

16:53.519 --> 16:55.074
Okay, well, that's
not entirely true, sir.

16:55.075 --> 16:57.882
- You quit the profession.
- I'm still in the system.

16:57.883 --> 16:59.926
It's just a...
Different part. Ha ha.

17:02.254 --> 17:05.278
- Mr. Brian Michaels...
- Yes, sir.

17:05.421 --> 17:07.856
Is suing the three
parties involved

17:07.971 --> 17:11.781
in his meticulously
planned marriage proposal.

17:11.781 --> 17:15.352
The proposal went awry, and his
grandmother's wedding ring,

17:15.353 --> 17:19.558
appraised at $11,500, was lost.

17:19.559 --> 17:25.428
So Mr. Michaels is requesting
of one unemployed actor,

17:25.429 --> 17:26.618
one singing waiter,

17:26.619 --> 17:29.536
and one cupcake maker...

17:31.221 --> 17:32.777
Damages totaling...

17:33.115 --> 17:35.527
$10 million. Really, Mr. Michaels?

17:35.528 --> 17:37.211
Yeah. I just want what's fair.

17:37.212 --> 17:40.165
- So do we, your honor!
- Your honor, I have...

17:44.540 --> 17:48.824
Now, as much as I would love to
have this case in my courtroom,

17:48.825 --> 17:52.272
I thought that it might be
better served elsewhere.

17:52.273 --> 17:53.777
So...

17:53.949 --> 17:55.350
Sit down.

17:55.351 --> 17:58.348
So we're going to try
something a little different...

17:58.349 --> 18:03.212
Alternative dispute resolution,
also known as mediation.

18:03.401 --> 18:04.614
Bailiff.

18:08.099 --> 18:09.948
- Kate Reed is not...
- Thanks.

18:09.949 --> 18:12.723
A lawyer. She is a mediator.

18:12.724 --> 18:14.885
A mediator is kind of

18:14.886 --> 18:17.091
a referee in a game with no rules,

18:17.092 --> 18:20.020
except those agreed to
by the parties involved.

18:20.197 --> 18:23.432
Ms. Reed handles all
sorts of disputes,

18:23.499 --> 18:25.504
some even bigger than yours.

18:25.505 --> 18:28.270
Earlier this year, she was
called in by the united nations

18:28.271 --> 18:32.121
to settle a border dispute
between Colombia and...Paraguay.

18:32.122 --> 18:33.744
Colombia and Nicaragua, sir.

18:33.745 --> 18:35.845
And it was their embassies
here in San Francisco.

18:35.846 --> 18:37.697
They border each other
on market street,

18:37.698 --> 18:39.198
and they share a common wall.

18:40.848 --> 18:43.196
But the u.N. Did call.

18:43.486 --> 18:45.178
- They did call.
- Ms. Reed.

18:45.179 --> 18:48.400
- Yes, sir. - Find a way to keep
this case out of my court.

18:48.401 --> 18:50.286
- Okay.
- You've got two days.

18:50.287 --> 18:51.585
Two days?

18:51.586 --> 18:53.627
Judge...There are
three defendants,

18:53.628 --> 18:55.432
and this guy's asking
for $10 million.

18:55.433 --> 18:57.057
Two days doesn't seem exactly...

18:57.058 --> 19:00.253
Okay. How about
tomorrow morning at 9:00?

19:00.254 --> 19:03.008
Would you like to try for
later on this afternoon?

19:03.200 --> 19:04.497
- No.
- Find a resolution

19:04.498 --> 19:07.036
or you will be sent to
prison for contempt of court.

19:07.037 --> 19:08.398
Yes, I can do that.

19:08.578 --> 19:10.846
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

19:10.913 --> 19:13.052
Bailiff, call the next case.

19:16.513 --> 19:17.871
Kate Reed's office.

19:17.872 --> 19:19.990
Judge Nicastro
really does hate me.

19:19.991 --> 19:22.042
No, he doesn't. He loves you.

19:22.043 --> 19:23.725
That's right. I forgot.

19:23.793 --> 19:25.235
Okay, so why does he hate me?

19:25.236 --> 19:27.476
Well... there's
the fineman debacle.

19:27.477 --> 19:30.602
- Yes. Right.
- And the examiner interview.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.572
- Okay. That was bad.
- And the joke you made

19:32.573 --> 19:35.103
about his wife and the horse
that his wife overheard.

19:35.104 --> 19:36.623
So you're saying
it's not random.

19:36.624 --> 19:38.118
Oh. I never said that.

19:38.119 --> 19:40.275
I like you more every day, Leo.

19:40.343 --> 19:43.695
Okay, um...The complainants
that Nicastro dumped on me

19:43.696 --> 19:45.276
will be there at 2:00,

19:45.277 --> 19:48.519
so...Set 'em up for me
in the conference room.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.639
Done. What about the Pease case?

19:50.640 --> 19:52.709
Solved. I'm amazing.

19:52.710 --> 19:53.986
I'll be back in 20.

20:09.874 --> 20:12.034
Next. Hey.

20:12.228 --> 20:13.672
Wake up.

20:17.281 --> 20:19.376
- Where is he?
- Out.

20:19.639 --> 20:22.007
- Lunch.
- That son of a bitch!

20:24.199 --> 20:26.751
- Did you not read the file?
- Which file, Kate?

20:26.894 --> 20:28.328
The file you couldn't
possibly have read

20:28.329 --> 20:29.658
because I didn't give it to you?

20:29.659 --> 20:32.300
The file that would be illegal for
you to have in your possession.

20:32.301 --> 20:35.262
Justin, Justin,
the driver! The driver!

20:35.263 --> 20:38.203
Look, I'm in a meeting, Kate.
I'm gonna have to call you back. Sorry.

20:40.657 --> 20:41.808
Hi...

20:42.730 --> 20:44.310
- How'd you know where I was?
- It's Monday.

20:44.497 --> 20:46.406
He'll have a polish with
onions and a peach snapple.

20:46.407 --> 20:48.179
- This kid is going to Yale.
- I'm sorry.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.248
Isn't this the same kid you
just asked me to put in jail?

20:50.249 --> 20:52.202
Yeah. But that was before
I knew the full story.

20:52.717 --> 20:53.305
Thank you.

20:53.306 --> 20:56.105
- Justin. Don't do this!
- It's my heart.

20:56.106 --> 20:57.443
- You don't have a heart!
- Hey, hey, hey!

20:57.581 --> 21:01.185
- God! Read the damn file!
- Hey, I wrote the file!

21:01.186 --> 21:02.396
And if you read it,
that's a crime.

21:02.397 --> 21:04.718
I'm gonna go talk
to those kids. Taxi!

21:04.719 --> 21:07.208
Go ahead. What do you think
they're gonna say, huh?

21:07.209 --> 21:10.110
They're gonna say what they
always say... "I'm innocent."

21:10.144 --> 21:11.580
I did you a favor.

21:11.876 --> 21:13.008
You asked me to do this.

21:13.009 --> 21:16.470
Certain things have been
put in motion... Hey, Kate!

21:23.415 --> 21:25.510
Sir, can you put your arms out?

21:25.534 --> 21:26.472
Thank you.

21:31.584 --> 21:33.496
- I'm guilty.
- You realize that means...

21:33.497 --> 21:35.004
- I'll do the time.
- D'Sean,

21:35.005 --> 21:36.600
this is a class "a" felony.

21:36.601 --> 21:39.316
Nah. Gun wasn't loaded.

21:39.317 --> 21:40.843
It doesn't matter if
the gun was chocolate.

21:40.844 --> 21:43.401
You were in a moving vehicle.
You threatened another driver.

21:43.402 --> 21:45.616
The d.A.'S gonna
offer you ten years.

21:45.891 --> 21:47.593
I woulda pulled the
trigger if I knew that.

21:47.594 --> 21:49.381
And ten years for Nathan.

21:51.672 --> 21:53.579
Well. He might only
have to do five.

21:54.432 --> 21:55.442
For what?

21:55.739 --> 21:57.409
He was driving.
He's an accessory.

21:57.410 --> 21:58.572
No...

21:58.573 --> 22:01.487
Nathan didn't do nothing,
he... my cousin...

22:01.509 --> 22:02.544
- My cousin, he's...
- I know, but listen to me.

22:02.545 --> 22:03.454
- He's clean.
- Listen to me.

22:03.455 --> 22:05.703
- It doesn't work like that.
- Let me do his time.

22:05.870 --> 22:07.689
He doesn't have to go
down for what I did.

22:07.690 --> 22:08.648
The courts are not
gonna let you do that.

22:08.649 --> 22:12.722
Give it to me!
He didn't do nothin'!

22:13.497 --> 22:15.363
He didn't do nothin'!

22:15.621 --> 22:17.137
He didn't do nothin'!

22:17.140 --> 22:18.959
Say it! Say he's innocent!

22:18.960 --> 22:21.297
He didn't do nothin'!
He's innocent!

22:21.298 --> 22:22.930
That's my homie!

22:23.099 --> 22:25.858
You wanna take him away?
That's my boy!

22:34.522 --> 22:35.766
"National honor society.

22:35.767 --> 22:37.190
"Big brother.

22:37.549 --> 22:38.482
All-state marching band."

22:38.483 --> 22:41.865
Wow. You're an
impressive kid, Nathan.

22:42.954 --> 22:44.236
Tell me what happened.

22:46.257 --> 22:47.655
We were heading home.

22:48.278 --> 22:51.500
Just...Driving.
Listening to the radio.

22:53.389 --> 22:54.573
And all of a sudden...

22:54.591 --> 22:56.453
Ha ha ha... yeah, whatever.

22:56.958 --> 22:59.021
What's up? Don't y'all
know how to drive?

22:59.022 --> 23:00.301
What are you doing,
man? He took his piece out.

23:00.302 --> 23:02.290
- You don't know how to drive?
- Yo, D'Sean!

23:02.291 --> 23:04.820
- Yo, man...Yo, relax!
- It's on, man!

23:04.821 --> 23:06.289
No! We gonna get pinched!

23:06.290 --> 23:08.428
He wasn't gonna shoot
or anything, he just...

23:08.470 --> 23:10.307
That's just D'Sean.

23:10.328 --> 23:11.695
- Chill! It's all right!
- No, man!

23:11.696 --> 23:13.914
The lady in the car,
she saw the gun, I think,

23:13.915 --> 23:15.385
and freaked.

23:16.768 --> 23:18.483
You said there was a
woman driving the car?

23:18.484 --> 23:20.352
- Yes.
- Did you see a man

23:20.353 --> 23:22.738
in the passenger
seat or in the back?

23:22.739 --> 23:23.885
I barely saw her.

23:23.886 --> 23:25.830
Okay. Why did D'Sean have a gun?

23:25.831 --> 23:27.919
Everyone I know's got a gun.

23:28.969 --> 23:31.882
'Cept me. I'm the good boy.

23:33.409 --> 23:35.080
So what kind of time am I facing?

23:36.100 --> 23:37.192
Ten years.

23:38.512 --> 23:40.080
Five if you plea out of it.

23:40.081 --> 23:41.890
Or you could insist
that you go to trial.

23:41.891 --> 23:43.963
Um, you've got no priors.

23:44.780 --> 23:47.446
Roll the dice. Take my chances?

23:47.656 --> 23:49.662
Well...Yeah.

23:52.897 --> 23:54.450
From the ghetto to Yale.

23:56.083 --> 23:57.514
Just that right there...

23:58.322 --> 23:59.294
Getting in.

24:01.585 --> 24:03.373
I think I used up all my luck.

24:04.385 --> 24:07.113
I don't believe that.
And you shouldn't either.

24:07.975 --> 24:08.902
Why not?

24:10.250 --> 24:13.013
There was definitely a
woman driving the car?

24:13.014 --> 24:13.909
Definitely.

24:15.655 --> 24:16.552
Okay.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.400
You've still got some luck left.

24:26.839 --> 24:28.257
It's black and white, Kate.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.272
Nothing is ever black and white.

24:30.273 --> 24:32.496
The guy had a woman in the car.

24:32.497 --> 24:34.098
That... that's not a crime.

24:34.099 --> 24:37.048
The kids... they pulled a gun.

24:37.049 --> 24:39.122
- That is.
- One. One kid pulled a gun.

24:39.123 --> 24:41.762
- There's no legal distinction.
- Okay. But there should be.

24:42.774 --> 24:44.702
What does any of this have
to do with your mediation?

24:44.703 --> 24:46.194
Why would Doug lie?

24:46.773 --> 24:49.146
Why would he cop to a DUI
when he wasn't even driving?

24:49.147 --> 24:51.316
Because if a guy's
gonna lie about anything,

24:51.317 --> 24:53.303
it's gonna be about a woman.

24:53.615 --> 24:54.780
Your Doug

24:55.053 --> 24:57.925
would rather face a judge
than face his wife.

24:58.742 --> 25:00.955
Speaking of...
When's yours coming back?

25:00.956 --> 25:02.694
- Terry's up in Seattle.
- Uh-huh.

25:02.695 --> 25:05.806
Pitching a new account.
But coming back tonight...

25:05.807 --> 25:07.062
For date night.

25:07.063 --> 25:08.935
- Yeah, date night!
- Ooh!

25:08.936 --> 25:09.947
- Ooh.
- Special.

25:09.948 --> 25:12.124
- You got that?
- I thought you hated it

25:12.125 --> 25:14.495
- when dad worked all the time.
- I did.

25:15.015 --> 25:16.723
That's why I quit the firm.

25:17.471 --> 25:19.407
Lila's gonna know her father.

25:19.879 --> 25:20.891
Well, that's good.

25:20.892 --> 25:22.756
At least she'll know
one of her parents.

25:22.781 --> 25:24.763
So...Good work there, dad.

25:25.193 --> 25:27.833
Did you come here to tell
me that my marriage sucks?

25:27.834 --> 25:29.824
- No, no, no, I...
- But you think it does.

25:29.825 --> 25:31.357
Look, I just...
I think it's different

25:31.358 --> 25:32.607
than what you said you wanted.

25:32.608 --> 25:35.717
I thought mediators were
supposed to solve problems.

25:35.875 --> 25:37.622
Sometimes. And then...

25:37.623 --> 25:39.321
Sometimes they just
like to point 'em out,

25:39.322 --> 25:40.727
you know...No charge.

25:40.728 --> 25:44.215
♪ If I were king of the forest ♪

25:44.216 --> 25:45.945
- I don't believe you.
- Talk to me, Leo.

25:45.946 --> 25:47.466
The people from
judge Nicastro's court

25:47.467 --> 25:48.334
are waiting for you in
the conference room.

25:48.335 --> 25:50.364
- Ooh, God damn it. Oh...
- Nice.

25:50.365 --> 25:52.193
- Oh. Okay.
- Oh...

25:52.972 --> 25:54.540
Aunt Katie's got a potty mouth!

25:54.541 --> 25:57.030
Uh...I gotta go.
I love you. Bye.

25:57.031 --> 25:57.807
- Love ya.
- I'll call you later.

25:57.808 --> 25:58.712
All right.

26:00.513 --> 26:02.392
Leo, something's not right
with this Pease thing.

26:02.393 --> 26:03.311
I need to head over there first.

26:03.312 --> 26:04.821
But what about the people
in the conference room?

26:04.822 --> 26:06.883
Yeah. Just tell
them I'm running late.

26:07.443 --> 26:09.565
- Oh, no! Wait, wait!
- Okay. Soon as my hearing comes back.

26:09.566 --> 26:11.437
Wait! Wait! Please! Ah!

26:12.714 --> 26:13.610
Uh, taxi!

26:13.611 --> 26:15.701
- Totally obsessive!
- O-oh, obsessive?

26:15.702 --> 26:17.797
Y-you were drunk!

26:19.003 --> 26:20.673
Ms. Reed's running late.

26:22.669 --> 26:24.519
- You guys need anything?
- Boom!

26:26.166 --> 26:27.618
I'd like to hear you say,
Brian...

26:27.619 --> 26:29.019
You were crying!

26:29.020 --> 26:30.807
So you're all good then.

26:33.195 --> 26:34.246
Okay, then.

26:36.173 --> 26:38.892
I've got some good news
and some better news.

26:38.980 --> 26:39.913
I'm comin' in.

26:43.485 --> 26:45.119
All right, well,
I talked to the d.A.

26:45.255 --> 26:46.545
The government's
looking at ten years,

26:46.546 --> 26:49.647
and there is no interest
in pursuing Doug's DUI.

26:49.648 --> 26:51.474
Terrific. That's everything.

26:51.750 --> 26:53.000
I believe it is, yes.

26:53.001 --> 26:55.023
What about the other punk,
the driver?

26:55.024 --> 26:56.229
Well, here's the thing.

26:56.230 --> 26:57.646
There's two versions
of the accident.

26:57.647 --> 26:59.807
Wrong. There was one accident.

26:59.808 --> 27:00.856
Two parties involved.

27:00.857 --> 27:02.872
One party of criminals,
the other my son.

27:02.873 --> 27:04.012
That's one version.

27:04.013 --> 27:05.354
Do you know who was in the car?

27:05.355 --> 27:07.266
Yeah. Scumbag one
and scumbag two.

27:07.267 --> 27:10.198
D'Sean has a record,
but Nathan the driver doesn't.

27:10.199 --> 27:11.580
In fact, he's quite
the model citizen.

27:11.581 --> 27:13.532
He's got a full
scholarship to Yale.

27:13.533 --> 27:15.412
- He starts in the fall.
- Not anymore.

27:15.413 --> 27:17.775
Nathan Henry's a good kid,
Charles... he's smart.

27:17.776 --> 27:19.583
Smart kids choose smart friends,

27:19.584 --> 27:21.457
not gun-carrying gangsters.

27:21.458 --> 27:23.324
Well, maybe in the suburbs.

27:23.529 --> 27:24.797
If Douglas grew up
in hunter's point,

27:24.798 --> 27:25.600
he'd have friends with guns.

27:25.601 --> 27:27.405
Oh, please.
I'm sick of hearing about

27:27.406 --> 27:29.564
how getting spanked
when you were four

27:29.565 --> 27:31.973
gives you license to rob a
grocery store when you're 40.

27:31.974 --> 27:33.435
It's an excuse,
and I don't buy it.

27:33.436 --> 27:37.027
It is easy to be judgmental
when you grow up with wealth.

27:37.731 --> 27:39.580
The children of privilege
aren't allowed to fail.

27:39.581 --> 27:41.303
- It's not their fault.
- No, it's not their fault.

27:41.304 --> 27:42.863
- That's right... exactly right.
- So whose fault is it

27:42.864 --> 27:44.685
that when you grow up
in a lousy neighborhood

27:44.686 --> 27:47.291
you study your ass off
to make straight as,

27:47.292 --> 27:49.075
you get the crap kicked out of
you for not being in a gang?

27:49.076 --> 27:51.048
I grew up poor.
I'm not a criminal.

27:51.049 --> 27:52.681
Neither is Nathan Henry.

27:52.836 --> 27:55.706
He not only survived
and stayed clean...

27:55.707 --> 27:57.844
He got a full scholarship to Yale.

27:58.391 --> 27:59.911
Now, the gunman,
he'll do his time.

27:59.912 --> 28:01.214
He knows it's coming.

28:01.215 --> 28:02.990
But you've gotta let
Nathan off the hook.

28:02.991 --> 28:05.642
You lack your father's clarity.

28:05.643 --> 28:06.657
It troubles me.

28:07.044 --> 28:08.678
It troubled him, too, sir.

28:09.349 --> 28:11.152
Dad, maybe we're pushing
a little too hard on this.

28:11.153 --> 28:14.532
Does it...Really matter if
this Nathan goes to jail?

28:14.533 --> 28:15.851
Yes.

28:16.277 --> 28:18.327
Again, Douglas, judgment.

28:18.328 --> 28:20.061
- Let's not lose sight of...
- When I asked if you knew

28:20.062 --> 28:23.118
who was in the car,
I was talking about Doug's.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.498
There was a woman driving his car.

28:25.499 --> 28:27.833
Both boys saw her,
and in the police report,

28:27.834 --> 28:30.088
a woman's purse was
found on the floor.

28:30.178 --> 28:31.374
Now, I don't suppose
that your wife ran

28:31.375 --> 28:32.854
from the scene of an accident.

28:33.553 --> 28:35.233
Carol-Anne was in L.A.

28:36.027 --> 28:37.310
I'm sure she was.

28:38.255 --> 28:40.315
No I.D. In the purse.
Cheap makeup.

28:40.666 --> 28:41.870
Was she a rental?

28:44.046 --> 28:47.231
Uh, I met her in the
bar at the restaurant.

28:52.072 --> 28:52.864
Oh!

28:52.865 --> 28:54.327
What? What?

28:55.479 --> 28:57.107
Oh, yeah, wake up!

28:57.530 --> 28:59.824
She had a room
at a hotel nearby.

29:00.564 --> 29:02.079
Never made it there, tough.

29:11.712 --> 29:12.800
What was her name?

29:12.843 --> 29:14.688
- Oh, I don't know.
- You don't even know her name,

29:14.689 --> 29:16.485
and you let her drive the beemer?

29:16.486 --> 29:18.233
That's the part
that bothers you?

29:19.438 --> 29:20.954
You pick up hookers a lot?

29:22.006 --> 29:23.143
Well...

29:23.247 --> 29:24.374
What's a lot?

29:24.375 --> 29:26.085
Jesus, Douglas.

29:26.554 --> 29:28.108
What's the point of all this?

29:28.382 --> 29:29.899
Well, facts change.

29:29.979 --> 29:31.476
Positions should too.

29:31.554 --> 29:33.187
Everything's not
so black and white.

29:33.938 --> 29:34.703
All right, gentlemen,

29:34.704 --> 29:36.455
I, uh, have another
meeting to go to.

29:36.456 --> 29:38.784
I'm gonna let you two talk.
Call me later...

29:39.126 --> 29:40.605
And we'll wrap this up.

30:23.529 --> 30:24.921
$10 million!

30:24.922 --> 30:27.692
Do you know how much of a waste
of time this is for me right now?

30:27.693 --> 30:29.056
Oh, hey, I need Kate.

30:29.589 --> 30:31.881
Oh, you know what? She is busy.

30:31.882 --> 30:33.985
She's got a
court-ordered mediation.

30:35.075 --> 30:36.705
All right, well,
tell her I'm looking for her.

30:38.028 --> 30:39.003
You know I will.

30:39.799 --> 30:40.927
Leonardo!

30:41.586 --> 30:42.493
Leo!

30:44.123 --> 30:44.788
Hey.

30:44.789 --> 30:45.715
Come here.

30:47.719 --> 30:49.683
You know I would never
ask you to do anything

30:49.684 --> 30:52.666
that comes even close to
the border of illegality.

30:52.667 --> 30:54.899
- Oh, I know.
- And I'm not asking you now.

30:54.942 --> 30:56.854
Especially from your
dungeons & dragons buddies

30:56.855 --> 30:59.443
over at the police
department or the DMV.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.326
You've not asked
me many times before.

31:01.327 --> 31:04.000
Exactly. This is just
like one of those times.

31:04.304 --> 31:06.235
The license plate number
for Doug Pease's car.

31:06.236 --> 31:09.329
Find out everything you
can about him, the car,

31:09.330 --> 31:10.884
the night of the accident...
everything.

31:10.885 --> 31:12.705
Why? What are you...
What are you looking for?

31:12.789 --> 31:13.645
I don't know.

31:13.933 --> 31:15.768
Something just doesn't
seem right yet.

31:16.314 --> 31:18.308
- Okay, then.
- Yeah.

31:18.864 --> 31:20.590
Conference room.
I read their file.

31:20.591 --> 31:21.835
What do you think, like...An hour?

31:21.836 --> 31:24.334
Ugh. Dinner and a pillow.

31:24.335 --> 31:26.391
Ooh. Fun. Ha.

31:27.041 --> 31:28.405
Hello, everyone.

31:28.521 --> 31:29.336
My name is Kate Reed,

31:29.337 --> 31:31.336
and I will be your mediator today.

31:31.337 --> 31:32.564
- Hi, Kate.
- Can you please talk

31:32.565 --> 31:34.700
- to that idiot?
- These morons...

31:34.922 --> 31:37.525
- I gotta get out of here.
- A million doll...

31:40.050 --> 31:41.691
Better. Thank you.

31:42.326 --> 31:44.624
Okay, uh... Brian Michaels,

31:44.625 --> 31:47.458
you wanted to make a
memorable wedding proposal

31:47.752 --> 31:48.958
to your girlfriend.

31:49.037 --> 31:50.321
- Hello.
- Hi.

31:50.322 --> 31:52.809
- Quite a complicated plan.
- Actually, it was very simple.

31:52.810 --> 31:53.773
Oh, please!

31:53.774 --> 31:55.667
- Yeah, like d-day.
- Psycho!

31:55.668 --> 31:58.363
Jessica and I
ordered a cable car,

31:58.364 --> 32:00.069
which is where we
met three years ago.

32:00.070 --> 32:01.777
I hired three people,

32:01.778 --> 32:04.110
each one representing one
year in our dating history,

32:04.111 --> 32:07.153
to board the cable car at
three consecutive stops...

32:07.154 --> 32:10.301
The first to read my first
love letter to Jessica.

32:10.458 --> 32:12.880
The second to sing,
time of my life.

32:12.881 --> 32:14.590
And one was to present
us with cupcakes

32:14.591 --> 32:16.203
with our faces in the icing.

32:16.204 --> 32:17.781
- Oh, that's sweet.
- I know.

32:17.782 --> 32:20.383
- Okay, so what happened?
- Well, the actor was drunk,

32:20.384 --> 32:22.436
the singing was terrible,
and the cupcakes...

32:22.437 --> 32:23.568
They looked nothing like us!

32:23.569 --> 32:25.509
I wasn't drunk. I had vertigo.

32:25.510 --> 32:26.987
- I have talent!
- It doesn't matter.

32:26.988 --> 32:28.880
I proposed anyway. All right?

32:28.881 --> 32:32.043
I presented Jessica with my
grandmother's engagement ring.

32:32.161 --> 32:33.614
She'd given me her father's watch.

32:33.615 --> 32:36.476
He passed away last year.
He loved Brian.

32:36.504 --> 32:38.721
I wanted to give her
something just as special.

32:38.723 --> 32:41.171
But their incompetence
made us lose the ring.

32:41.172 --> 32:42.767
- We never lost anything.
- You were going crazy!

32:42.768 --> 32:44.837
- He attacked me.
- You murdered our song!

32:44.838 --> 32:48.375
Don't make me...
Whistle again...Please.

32:48.376 --> 32:49.207
She dropped the ring.

32:49.208 --> 32:51.213
I may have been
technically drunk but...

32:51.214 --> 32:53.157
- It's not my fault.
- Well, then whose fault is it?

32:53.158 --> 32:55.443
- Yours!
- All right, Jessica,

32:55.444 --> 32:57.721
Brian proposed.
He gave you the ring.

32:57.996 --> 32:58.889
And then what happened?

32:58.890 --> 33:00.611
Well, I was about to put it on,

33:00.612 --> 33:02.400
and then everyone started yelling

33:02.401 --> 33:03.921
and someone was trying to pass me,

33:03.922 --> 33:06.214
and the cupcake with Brian's
face fell in this woman's lap

33:06.215 --> 33:09.323
and she screamed, and it...
It was gone, it was just gone.

33:09.324 --> 33:10.967
There was nothing that
you could do about it?

33:10.968 --> 33:11.850
No!

33:12.277 --> 33:13.988
I mean, you could
have held on to it.

33:14.069 --> 33:14.971
Oh!

33:17.176 --> 33:18.682
I-I'm not saying
it's your fault.

33:18.683 --> 33:21.402
- Okay. What are you saying?
- N-nothing.

33:21.414 --> 33:23.402
I mean, I-I'm saying it could
have happened to anyone.

33:23.403 --> 33:25.149
- It's like you said.
- Exactly.

33:25.150 --> 33:27.268
Could it have
happened to you, Brian?

33:27.384 --> 33:28.940
No. I would have held on to it.

33:29.103 --> 33:31.536
Oh, my God, you really
do think it's my fault!

33:31.537 --> 33:32.470
I didn't say that.

33:32.471 --> 33:33.739
Actually, you did.

33:33.740 --> 33:35.091
That's not what I meant!

33:35.092 --> 33:37.295
- Okay, what'd you mean?
- N-nothing.

33:37.296 --> 33:40.093
I just... oh, forget it. I...

33:40.459 --> 33:42.214
I-it's just it's really
hard for me to understand.

33:42.215 --> 33:43.375
That's all.

33:43.567 --> 33:45.355
I mean, I would never
lose your father's watch.

33:45.356 --> 33:46.957
It's too important to me.

33:46.958 --> 33:49.752
You think I lost the ring
because I don't care about it?

33:49.831 --> 33:51.435
That's... eh...

33:52.083 --> 33:54.106
All right. I'm gonna
send you folks home.

33:54.107 --> 33:55.758
- Yes!
- Okay? So just be in court

33:55.759 --> 33:57.738
- tomorrow morning at 9:00.
- 9:00? I'm not even awake.

33:57.739 --> 33:58.346
Actually, you know,
I'd like to stay

33:58.347 --> 34:00.807
- and watch this for a bit.
- Yeah. No.

34:00.808 --> 34:02.779
He's got some...issues.

34:04.255 --> 34:06.588
Let's just get this
all out right now.

34:10.978 --> 34:11.556
Harrington.

34:11.556 --> 34:13.851
Beware the one who
whispers in the night.

34:13.851 --> 34:16.542
He stokes the fire
that never dies...

34:16.556 --> 34:18.380
Oh. Thanks. Appreciate that.

34:18.496 --> 34:21.255
And walks the eness circle.

34:22.577 --> 34:23.667
What filthy
creature of the night

34:23.668 --> 34:25.223
dares call by day?

34:25.235 --> 34:27.762
Hey, it's Leonardo.
I need some information.

34:28.813 --> 34:30.911
Open. Close.

34:31.193 --> 34:33.434
Open. Close.

34:33.435 --> 34:34.679
It's easy now.

34:34.681 --> 34:36.007
- Open...Close.
- In here.

34:36.007 --> 34:38.659
Without my maniac
fiancé screaming at me

34:38.661 --> 34:39.934
and people there freaking out!

34:39.935 --> 34:42.527
It's one hand on the rail,
one on the ring.

34:42.529 --> 34:45.319
My leg is free.
Nobody's getting near this!

34:45.320 --> 34:46.215
Nobody!

34:46.237 --> 34:47.485
All right!

34:48.377 --> 34:50.627
I think we got it all out, right?

34:50.942 --> 34:51.953
Most of it.

34:52.029 --> 34:54.254
A lot of it.
Let's just take a break.

35:03.438 --> 35:05.034
Ooh. Hot date?

35:05.150 --> 35:06.642
Hmph. Tim Connelly.

35:06.643 --> 35:09.558
Yikes. Once again,
glad I'm not you.

35:09.559 --> 35:12.138
I just got off a call
with Charles Pease.

35:12.139 --> 35:13.415
Thought you had
everything handled.

35:13.416 --> 35:15.350
- He's calling off the deal.
- But that's absurd,

35:15.351 --> 35:16.449
because when I left
their office earlier...

35:16.450 --> 35:18.536
You met with Charles
and Douglas without me?

35:18.537 --> 35:21.422
Yes. Well, I-I got some
information about the accident.

35:21.423 --> 35:22.728
See, the boy driving
the other car...

35:22.729 --> 35:24.127
- Wait. He's not our client.
- I know that.

35:24.128 --> 35:25.812
But the boy driving the
other car is innocent.

35:25.813 --> 35:27.983
But he's not our client.

35:28.529 --> 35:29.810
Aw, Kate...

35:30.288 --> 35:31.422
I call you in to help,

35:31.423 --> 35:33.598
and now I've got to
clean up your mess.

35:34.222 --> 35:35.540
Wow, I'm... I'm sorry.

35:35.541 --> 35:38.357
I-I should never let
an innocent kid's life

35:38.358 --> 35:40.297
stand in the way
of our legal fees.

35:40.446 --> 35:42.701
You know, is it me you hate?

35:42.897 --> 35:44.568
Or lawyers in general?

35:45.512 --> 35:47.982
Maybe it's the fact that I
married your beloved father.

35:49.267 --> 35:50.251
You know what?

35:51.416 --> 35:53.243
He was beloved to me too.

36:07.782 --> 36:09.260
My father was a lawyer.

36:10.696 --> 36:13.262
My ex-husband is a lawyer.

36:17.451 --> 36:19.936
My brother is a lawyer,
and I was a lawyer.

36:21.190 --> 36:22.426
And even though I carry around

36:22.427 --> 36:24.323
more than a small
amount of self-hatred,

36:24.324 --> 36:27.435
if I really hated lawyers,
I wouldn't work at a law firm.

36:28.367 --> 36:30.204
And as for marrying
my father, yes...

36:31.360 --> 36:32.722
I hate you for that.

36:33.539 --> 36:35.415
I thought my mother
made him happy...

36:35.416 --> 36:36.699
Until I saw him with you.

36:38.250 --> 36:40.192
And I don't know what
to think about that.

36:42.056 --> 36:43.222
So I hate you.

36:44.815 --> 36:46.161
It's simpler that way.

37:12.611 --> 37:14.167
Is that you, the dwarf?

37:14.346 --> 37:17.260
I'm the gnome. In wintergrasp.

37:17.378 --> 37:19.716
- Well, what is he doing?
- Defending the keep.

37:19.717 --> 37:22.484
- It looks like he's attacking.
- I'm taking out the towers.

37:22.562 --> 37:24.840
Even when you're playing defense,
you've got to attack.

37:25.114 --> 37:26.339
- Interesting.
- Mm-hmm.

37:26.340 --> 37:28.575
Focus on the wrong thing,
you get killed.

37:31.147 --> 37:34.888
- I have learned much from you.
- Well, I am the master.

37:34.889 --> 37:36.480
And you've taught me well.

37:37.417 --> 37:38.878
Anything on Doug's car?

37:39.694 --> 37:40.630
Not yet.

37:41.484 --> 37:44.282
Okay. Go home.

37:44.448 --> 37:46.011
How's it going with
the loving couple?

37:46.208 --> 37:47.131
Good.

37:47.375 --> 37:49.049
Yeah. I, uh...

37:49.139 --> 37:50.615
I feel a breakthrough coming.

37:52.246 --> 37:53.957
Well, I-I'll stick around.

37:53.958 --> 37:56.289
Still got some, uh, work...To do.

37:56.290 --> 37:57.159
Okay.

38:02.902 --> 38:04.301
You didn't see that
coming at all, did ya?

38:04.302 --> 38:05.206
That it was her brother, right?

38:05.207 --> 38:08.028
Oh...I did not, no.

38:08.454 --> 38:09.555
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me.

38:09.556 --> 38:12.108
Oh, no, no, no, Tim, I am done.

38:12.109 --> 38:13.109
I have another meeting.

38:13.110 --> 38:14.567
I don't think you do.

38:18.722 --> 38:19.762
You're so funny.

38:19.763 --> 38:21.580
Oh...Ha.

38:21.581 --> 38:23.446
I get that a lot.

38:23.894 --> 38:24.788
What do you want?

38:25.681 --> 38:26.587
Oh.

38:30.330 --> 38:32.617
It's...Gratifying

38:32.726 --> 38:35.418
to know that I have
your company's support.

38:35.662 --> 38:38.306
Reed & Reed will continue to
provide the level of service...

38:38.307 --> 38:40.022
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

38:40.023 --> 38:43.003
Look...I'm easy, okay?

38:43.004 --> 38:45.710
You guys do good work.
I got no complaints.

38:45.789 --> 38:47.178
The old man was just
trying to shake ya down

38:47.179 --> 38:49.152
for a better rate, the prick.

38:49.153 --> 38:51.379
Don't worry... I'm not gonna let
him pull our business away.

38:51.380 --> 38:53.631
Thank you. Thank you.

38:53.662 --> 38:56.079
I appreciate the loyalty,
and you can be sure

38:56.080 --> 38:59.332
I will go the extra mile
to make sure you're happy.

39:04.574 --> 39:05.512
What's that?

39:06.636 --> 39:07.802
Extra mile.

39:09.819 --> 39:12.115
Actually, it's more like
an extra couple of floors.

39:12.854 --> 39:14.375
I told ya I was easy.

39:17.255 --> 39:19.237
- Thank you both.
- Our pleasure.

39:19.693 --> 39:20.743
Oh, Tim...

39:20.975 --> 39:22.765
I think we, uh...

39:23.592 --> 39:24.991
Overindulged.

39:26.534 --> 39:29.484
Thank you so much
for the business.

39:29.485 --> 39:30.342
Good night.

39:32.050 --> 39:33.721
What, am I too young
for you, Lauren?

39:33.956 --> 39:35.574
You'd rather have
drinks with my dad?

39:36.826 --> 39:39.779
Hey, Lauren,
I want my extra mile, okay?

39:46.936 --> 39:48.141
Can I see your watch?

39:49.230 --> 39:49.881
My watch?

39:49.882 --> 39:52.476
Hmm-hmm. The one Jessica gave you,
her father's watch.

40:00.472 --> 40:01.607
You know what, Brian?

40:02.505 --> 40:04.832
I don't think you're ever
gonna forgive Jessica

40:05.166 --> 40:06.490
for letting go of your
grandmother's ring.

40:06.491 --> 40:08.158
It's kinda hard to understand.

40:09.123 --> 40:10.146
I'm just saying.

40:10.147 --> 40:11.059
So...

40:11.166 --> 40:13.271
The only way for you
to get past this

40:14.190 --> 40:16.078
is to destroy something
important to Jessica.

40:19.580 --> 40:21.049
- Smash the watch.
- What?

40:21.050 --> 40:23.010
- No!
- It's the only way.

40:23.011 --> 40:24.281
And then you'll be even.

40:24.282 --> 40:26.186
- Y-you're crazy.
- Brian.

40:26.352 --> 40:28.006
- It's the only way.
- Brian, no!

40:28.007 --> 40:29.825
- I-I won't do it.
- Oh, come on, do it.

40:29.826 --> 40:30.942
- No!
- Just smash it.

40:30.943 --> 40:33.067
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm not gonna smash the watch.

40:33.068 --> 40:35.012
- Smash the watch.
- No. It was her father's watch.

40:35.013 --> 40:37.422
She gave me the watch.
It's too important, I'm not...

40:37.423 --> 40:39.339
- Aah!
- Oh...Oh!

40:39.364 --> 40:40.838
Oh, my God, I can't
believe you just did that.

40:40.839 --> 40:42.315
I'm so sorry!

40:43.130 --> 40:44.619
What kind of mediator are you?

40:44.620 --> 40:46.078
I loved that watch.

40:46.079 --> 40:47.615
I loved how special it was to you

40:47.616 --> 40:49.142
that you wanted me to have it.

40:49.143 --> 40:50.660
But that's how I
felt about the ring.

40:50.661 --> 40:52.317
Brian, I was devastated.

40:52.318 --> 40:55.063
I'm sorry I made you
feel worse on top of that.

40:55.350 --> 40:57.346
Sorry that I made you feel
the way that I do now.

40:57.347 --> 40:59.225
I feel... Oh, my God.

40:59.226 --> 41:00.986
It's just a watch.

41:02.329 --> 41:03.528
It's just a ring.

41:03.586 --> 41:06.882
They're symbols.
We have the real thing.

41:07.378 --> 41:08.738
I love you, Jessica.

41:10.217 --> 41:11.608
- You, I hate.
- Ditto.

41:11.609 --> 41:12.745
Oh...

41:14.800 --> 41:16.656
Buffy the vampire slayer.

41:17.659 --> 41:18.794
Wrong watch.

41:20.052 --> 41:21.124
Sleight of hand.

41:22.712 --> 41:24.455
It's easy to lose sight
of what's important.

41:24.798 --> 41:27.295
You focus on the wrong thing,
you get killed.

41:27.645 --> 41:28.727
I stopped breathing for a while.

41:28.728 --> 41:30.960
No, don't do that.
Don't ever do that.

41:30.961 --> 41:33.489
Brian, are you dropping
the charges and moving on?

41:34.057 --> 41:35.021
Moving on.

41:35.022 --> 41:36.061
Excellent.

41:36.658 --> 41:37.970
I'll see you in court tomorrow.

41:53.606 --> 41:54.566
I'm awake.

41:55.567 --> 41:56.766
And that's not funny.

41:58.236 --> 41:59.180
Go home.

41:59.530 --> 42:01.128
I haven't heard
anything about the car.

42:01.129 --> 42:02.521
It's okay. Maybe tomorrow.

42:02.637 --> 42:04.396
Definitely. All right.

42:04.693 --> 42:05.845
- I'm going.
- Okay.

42:07.974 --> 42:10.086
- Oh, Leo?
- Yep.

42:10.087 --> 42:10.730
Uh, you know that

42:10.731 --> 42:12.425
Buffy the vampire
slayer watch you have?

42:12.426 --> 42:14.359
- Yeah.
- Well, I wanted to get one for a friend.

42:14.360 --> 42:15.850
Where'd you get it,
like toys r us?

42:15.851 --> 42:18.277
Oh, no. That's one of only three

42:18.278 --> 42:20.566
inscribed by Sarah
Michelle Geller herself

42:20.783 --> 42:22.412
to commemorate the 100th episode.

42:22.413 --> 42:24.892
That's why I keep it
locked in the desk drawer.

42:25.523 --> 42:26.514
Oh.

42:27.828 --> 42:29.380
Okay. Uh...

42:29.381 --> 42:30.489
Well, I guess I'll just have to

42:30.490 --> 42:31.963
track down one of
the other ones then.

42:33.101 --> 42:34.188
Good luck with that.

42:34.373 --> 42:35.733
It's gonna cost you a fortune.

42:37.473 --> 42:38.481
He's worth it.

42:43.922 --> 42:45.076
Hi, dad.

42:58.845 --> 42:59.768
It's late.

42:59.769 --> 43:01.784
- Yes.
- You home?

43:02.171 --> 43:03.577
No. You?

43:03.804 --> 43:04.926
What do you think?

43:05.514 --> 43:07.721
Tomorrow morning
Nathan's public defender

43:07.722 --> 43:09.658
is gonna recommend
that he cop a plea.

43:10.054 --> 43:12.087
Why? He didn't do anything.

43:12.361 --> 43:14.751
I'll offer five years,
and he'll take it.

43:14.752 --> 43:17.600
- It's a good deal.
- It's a death sentence, Justin.

43:17.938 --> 43:19.350
Look, I did what
you asked, Kate.

43:19.351 --> 43:21.770
He's not going to trail.
You're welcome, by the way.

43:21.830 --> 43:23.466
For what? He's going to jail.

43:23.467 --> 43:24.746
Yeah. Could have been worse.

43:24.747 --> 43:26.182
This thing gets in
front of a judge,

43:26.183 --> 43:28.528
- the law says a weapon...
- The law, the law, the law!

43:28.529 --> 43:30.924
God, what about the boy whose
life is gonna be ruined?

43:31.329 --> 43:32.880
Does he even matter in this?

43:33.661 --> 43:35.253
Go you're just like my dad,
you know that?

43:35.254 --> 43:38.196
You make these laws up,
and then you hold them up

43:38.197 --> 43:39.531
like they're sacred or something,

43:39.532 --> 43:41.709
like they're from God,
like there's nothing higher.

43:42.130 --> 43:43.715
But guess what, Justin. There is.

43:44.098 --> 43:46.499
There is justice
and there is truth.

43:46.702 --> 43:49.539
And who gets to
decide what's true... you?

43:50.242 --> 43:52.341
Five years, Kate.
It's a good deal.

43:52.342 --> 43:53.366
For who?

43:56.300 --> 43:57.821
You know what would
be a perfect wedding?

43:57.822 --> 44:00.094
- To elope?
- You're kidding, right?

44:01.242 --> 44:02.970
Because I've already
done the seating chart.

44:03.125 --> 44:04.613
It's alphabetized and everything.

44:05.190 --> 44:07.811
Your uncle asked to sit...

44:22.530 --> 44:23.667
It's very late.

44:25.306 --> 44:27.051
Tomorrow Nathan Henry's
gonna accept a deal

44:27.052 --> 44:29.307
that sends him to
prison for five years.

44:31.056 --> 44:31.713
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

44:31.714 --> 44:33.297
Sorry is meaningless, Doug.

44:34.537 --> 44:35.344
Call the D.A.

44:35.345 --> 44:37.026
He has discretion
with the sentence.

44:37.538 --> 44:39.330
Tell him that you don't
want Nathan charged.

44:39.557 --> 44:40.208
My father...

44:40.209 --> 44:42.481
Your father doesn't
make any sense.

44:42.504 --> 44:44.423
You were in the car.
This is your decision.

44:47.785 --> 44:48.983
I can't.

44:49.804 --> 44:51.035
Why?

44:51.633 --> 44:54.017
It looks like I've
lost the job I wanted.

44:54.494 --> 44:56.276
If I go against him,
I'll lose him,

44:56.277 --> 44:58.819
and if I lose him,
I lose the job that I have now.

44:58.820 --> 45:02.160
I lose my house.
I lose...Everything.

45:02.161 --> 45:04.674
Oh, Doug...Please.

45:06.411 --> 45:08.059
This is so much bigger than you.

45:09.588 --> 45:12.691
Stand up for Nathan.
Save his life.

45:13.116 --> 45:14.540
Do the right thing.

45:16.029 --> 45:17.117
I envy you.

45:18.459 --> 45:20.027
You always seem to
know what that is.

46:21.642 --> 46:23.778
You've reached the
cell phone of Teddy Reed.

46:23.986 --> 46:25.601
I'm not currently available.

46:26.149 --> 46:29.413
Leave a message, and I will
return your call promptly.

47:03.729 --> 47:05.567
Thank you. I'll take it to her.

47:16.712 --> 47:18.393
It's mine. Sorry.

47:20.299 --> 47:23.387
Uh...You want me
to toss it back?

47:23.864 --> 47:24.507
No, hold on to it.

47:24.508 --> 47:26.312
I'll come by tonight
and pick it up.

47:26.313 --> 47:27.303
Oh, will you?

47:28.818 --> 47:30.049
I'm Andrew, by the way.

47:31.334 --> 47:32.358
Kate.

47:32.688 --> 47:34.641
Kate, I'm taking the boat out.

47:34.775 --> 47:36.054
Sailing under the bridge.

47:36.188 --> 47:37.419
Wanna come out for a sail?

47:37.599 --> 47:40.176
God, you know what, that
just sounds like a great idea.

47:40.177 --> 47:43.024
But, uh, I've got this little
thing called a job, you know?

47:43.417 --> 47:44.634
Actually, I don't.

47:45.488 --> 47:46.945
Mm. Hi.

47:47.043 --> 47:48.052
Hi.

47:55.033 --> 47:57.320
Oh, my God. Hold on. Hey!

47:57.375 --> 48:00.120
It was a messenger.
He... he said it was important.

48:00.121 --> 48:01.470
- I was just...
- Psh, psh, psh...

48:01.471 --> 48:02.988
this is amazing. This is epic.

48:02.989 --> 48:04.784
Thank you so much.
This is exactly what I wanted!

48:04.785 --> 48:06.703
Um...I gotta go. I can't be late.

48:06.704 --> 48:07.704
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

48:07.705 --> 48:09.065
You have a fantastic day!

48:11.202 --> 48:13.450
Leo, I've got the picture.
Oh, my God... Okay.

48:13.451 --> 48:15.316
Uh...Nathan's supposed
to make his plea today,

48:15.317 --> 48:17.893
so tell Doug Pease I'm coming
over right after court.

48:25.408 --> 48:27.334
Judge Nicastro.
Good news. Great news!

48:27.335 --> 48:28.914
Mr. Michaels is
dropping the lawsuit,

48:28.915 --> 48:31.403
and further, he agrees to
drop all future lawsuits

48:31.404 --> 48:33.070
regarding the failed
engagement plans

48:33.071 --> 48:34.457
and the loss of his
grandmother's ring.

48:34.458 --> 48:36.121
Mr. Michaels, is that true?

48:36.227 --> 48:37.476
- Yes.
- Yes!

48:37.477 --> 48:38.742
As long as I can still sue

48:38.743 --> 48:39.718
if something goes wrong
with the wedding.

48:39.719 --> 48:41.926
We're gonna have a hot air
balloon dropping rose petals...

48:41.927 --> 48:45.141
Enough? Okay?
You're driving yourself crazy.

48:45.142 --> 48:47.113
- Makin' me crazy.
- I just want the wedding

48:47.114 --> 48:48.876
to be everything that
the proposal wasn't,

48:48.877 --> 48:51.124
you know, unexpected
and surprising.

48:51.125 --> 48:52.386
Me too.

48:52.387 --> 48:53.923
Why don't we just get
married right now?

48:54.221 --> 48:55.597
W-eh... here?

48:55.659 --> 48:56.475
I mean, why not?

48:56.476 --> 48:57.254
We have everything we need.

48:57.255 --> 48:59.974
We have witnesses and a judge.
I mean, come on!

49:00.911 --> 49:02.834
- Are you surprised?
- Y-yeah!

49:02.835 --> 49:05.155
It's unexpected.
I didn't expect it.

49:05.251 --> 49:06.926
Brian, now or never.

49:07.635 --> 49:09.340
- Now.
- Judge.

49:09.341 --> 49:11.500
By the power vested in me
by the state of California,

49:11.501 --> 49:13.308
I now pronounce you man and wife.

49:13.620 --> 49:15.059
- That's it?
- There's some paperwork.

49:15.060 --> 49:16.613
Yay!

49:19.385 --> 49:20.393
Okay.

49:20.525 --> 49:22.380
Picture time. Smile.

49:23.185 --> 49:25.239
Aw! Congratulations!

49:25.240 --> 49:27.404
- Thank you so much.
- You're very welcome.

49:27.405 --> 49:29.621
When I have any future
conflicts, can I...

49:31.632 --> 49:33.281
15-minute recess.

49:33.288 --> 49:34.759
Newlyweds, meet me in my chambers.

49:34.760 --> 49:36.014
I'm gonna need some signatures,

49:36.015 --> 49:37.944
and then you can begin
your lifetime of happiness.

49:37.945 --> 49:40.105
- You three are free to go.
- Whoo!

49:40.570 --> 49:41.850
Ha ha! Thank you.

49:42.049 --> 49:43.039
I really love my watch.

49:43.040 --> 49:44.225
- Later.
- Bye.

49:44.352 --> 49:46.465
Bailiff, take Ms.
Reed into custody.

49:47.043 --> 49:48.579
What? Why?

49:48.926 --> 49:50.258
Because I took a picture?

49:50.259 --> 49:51.587
You were four minutes late.

49:52.069 --> 49:53.680
God. Everything's
a technicality.

49:53.681 --> 49:54.793
- I hate courts.
- I know you do.

49:54.794 --> 49:56.541
Wait, wait, you can't
be serious about this.

49:56.542 --> 49:58.414
I mean, does justice
look like this?

49:58.415 --> 50:00.721
I knew you'd recognize
it when you saw it.

50:00.829 --> 50:02.620
What? Hold on!

50:04.724 --> 50:07.653
♪ If I were king ♪

50:07.793 --> 50:10.001
♪ Of the forest ♪

50:11.508 --> 50:13.580
Leo. Hey,
are the new contracts in?

50:13.581 --> 50:15.486
They're being messengered
over to the Pease building.

50:15.487 --> 50:17.136
Lauren's on her way
to see Charles,

50:17.273 --> 50:18.849
and Douglas is expecting you.

50:18.850 --> 50:21.315
- Are you almost there?
- I'm walking into the lobby.

50:22.263 --> 50:23.401
Sure, you are.

50:25.288 --> 50:27.610
Hello! Hello! Excuse me! Sir!

50:30.060 --> 50:31.275
Somebody!

50:33.018 --> 50:34.942
Oh! Justin! Justin!

50:34.943 --> 50:37.532
Hey! Hi! Did you get
the message I left?

50:37.533 --> 50:39.403
Yes. And I moved Nathan's
plea to the end of the day.

50:39.404 --> 50:40.712
Oh! Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

50:40.713 --> 50:42.450
- I really gotta run.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

50:42.451 --> 50:43.730
Hold on! Hold on! Wait,
wait, wait!

50:43.731 --> 50:47.829
Wait... Hold on.
I need a teeny, tiny favor.

50:49.231 --> 50:50.300
Justin!

50:58.293 --> 51:00.908
Is there something specific
that's bothering you?

51:00.909 --> 51:03.010
I-is there a deal point
that can be improved on?

51:03.011 --> 51:04.334
Maybe the share valuation.

51:04.335 --> 51:06.046
It's just not going
to happen, Lauren.

51:06.365 --> 51:08.791
- Why?
- Because I said so.

51:09.584 --> 51:11.271
Please, I just have a
couple more thoughts.

51:11.272 --> 51:12.455
Put them in an email.

51:15.376 --> 51:16.321
I'll do that.

51:18.094 --> 51:19.887
We need to look past
the third quarter.

51:20.011 --> 51:22.011
Doug! Doug, hey.

51:22.503 --> 51:24.079
...Can we... can we talk in private?

51:24.080 --> 51:25.540
- No.
- No?

51:25.668 --> 51:27.685
Okay. Well...

51:28.021 --> 51:30.341
It's amazing technology,
these photo cameras.

51:31.579 --> 51:33.310
Uh, go on ahead.

51:33.311 --> 51:35.017
Crystal clear picture,
don't you think?

51:35.018 --> 51:35.884
Yep.

51:48.897 --> 51:49.857
What do you want?

51:50.436 --> 51:51.811
I want you to do
the right thing.

51:56.270 --> 51:57.662
I'll be in your father's office.

52:08.089 --> 52:09.161
- Kate!
- Excuse me.

52:09.431 --> 52:10.421
What do you want?

52:10.509 --> 52:11.948
I want what I've always wanted,

52:12.220 --> 52:14.583
what's best for you,
what's best for Doug,

52:14.632 --> 52:15.764
and what's best for Nathan Henry.

52:15.765 --> 52:17.400
That young man
is not my concern.

52:17.401 --> 52:18.617
No, he's mine.

52:19.287 --> 52:20.983
I was driving. It's my decision.

52:21.771 --> 52:23.547
I'm gonna ask to have
the charges dropped.

52:23.868 --> 52:24.575
I'll let the D.A. know

52:24.576 --> 52:25.768
that he'll be hearing
from you this morning.

52:25.769 --> 52:27.652
W-what are you doing?
Why are you here?

52:27.653 --> 52:29.318
- Our business is done.
- No, it's not.

52:29.319 --> 52:30.186
Don't contradict me, young lady.

52:30.187 --> 52:32.138
Oh, I always finish
what I start, Charlie.

52:32.139 --> 52:34.054
My father taught me that.
He taught me a lotta things.

52:34.055 --> 52:36.892
I'm sure he tried, but I doubt
you were really listening.

52:36.893 --> 52:39.372
God, you're just
like my dad! My gosh.

52:39.373 --> 52:40.237
You don't wanna retire

52:40.238 --> 52:41.743
because you're afraid you're
gonna disappear, but...

52:41.744 --> 52:42.810
Oh, save the psychobabble...

52:42.811 --> 52:44.855
You keep trying to hold
on so tightly, Charles,

52:44.856 --> 52:46.502
that that's exactly
what's gonna happen.

52:46.503 --> 52:49.015
You will disappear,
because when you die,

52:49.225 --> 52:50.921
everything you know
will die with you.

52:51.035 --> 52:53.211
But it doesn't have to.

52:53.435 --> 52:54.619
It can live on.

52:55.932 --> 52:58.122
Is this your way
of pushing me out?

52:58.270 --> 53:00.078
- Is this all your idea?
- No.

53:00.237 --> 53:03.517
Douglas's idea is that
you stay on as chairman.

53:04.241 --> 53:06.488
Oh, I-I think that is
an idea with some merit.

53:06.489 --> 53:08.224
- So now you're on her side.
- No, no, no, no.

53:08.225 --> 53:10.431
I'm on your company's side,
Charles, always.

53:10.634 --> 53:12.667
Douglas runs the
company as president,

53:13.405 --> 53:15.271
and you keep an eye
on the big picture.

53:15.272 --> 53:17.527
You mentor him.
You pass down what you know.

53:17.740 --> 53:19.180
That way, you'll have a legacy.

53:19.358 --> 53:21.310
And it'll be around
even when you're not.

53:21.820 --> 53:23.981
Douglas has his own ideas.

53:24.420 --> 53:26.340
He doesn't wanna listen to mine...
He never did.

53:27.082 --> 53:28.203
I can try.

53:29.393 --> 53:30.157
You're gonna make me read

53:30.158 --> 53:31.902
those damn pie charts, aren't you?

53:31.967 --> 53:33.420
- No.
- Liar.

53:33.421 --> 53:35.597
It's a smart move, Charles.

53:40.907 --> 53:44.115
If I see the word emeritus
or acting next to chairman,

53:44.116 --> 53:46.310
- the deal's off.
- No, you'll be the real chairman, dad.

53:46.311 --> 53:47.879
- That's right!
- Charlie.

53:48.248 --> 53:49.846
Are you and Doug on
the same page now?

53:52.775 --> 53:53.783
Excellent.

53:53.982 --> 53:55.434
Great. Well,
we'll need to amend the deals.

53:55.435 --> 53:57.563
- I'll have our contractor...
- Hold, please.

53:59.077 --> 54:00.308
I took the liberty.

54:04.969 --> 54:06.119
New contracts.

54:08.493 --> 54:09.820
Now, gentlemen...

54:11.132 --> 54:12.188
If you will...

54:13.069 --> 54:16.061
Just... initial at the XS.

54:21.874 --> 54:24.035
Have you started thinking
about next year's summer line?

54:24.081 --> 54:26.223
- Yeah. A little.
- A little is not good enough.

54:26.224 --> 54:28.974
- We need designs by next month.
- I know. We'll have them.

54:29.328 --> 54:30.288
A little.

54:30.670 --> 54:31.855
Nice work, boys.

54:34.975 --> 54:36.063
Great. Well.

54:37.106 --> 54:38.098
Look at that.

54:39.147 --> 54:40.268
Win-win.

54:47.113 --> 54:48.649
You blindsided me.

54:49.752 --> 54:50.982
I got the job done.

54:51.164 --> 54:53.339
- How?
- Trade secret.

54:53.340 --> 54:54.459
No. I don't think so.

54:59.382 --> 55:01.300
There was no woman in the car.

55:14.397 --> 55:15.678
See, everyone was
telling the truth.

55:15.679 --> 55:17.035
There was a woman driving...

55:19.880 --> 55:21.849
And Doug was the only
person in the car.

55:37.741 --> 55:38.828
- Hey, yo!
- What the hell?

55:38.829 --> 55:40.757
- You don't know how to drive?
- Oh, God! Ah!

55:41.139 --> 55:42.496
Yo, put the piece away, man!

55:42.497 --> 55:43.537
Yeah, that's right!

56:00.095 --> 56:01.087
Oh, my...

56:11.079 --> 56:12.778
Why can't you use your desk?

56:12.779 --> 56:13.835
No privacy.

56:14.875 --> 56:16.103
Didn't think you were coming in.

56:16.104 --> 56:18.761
Ohh. Yeah. Me neither.

56:21.924 --> 56:23.183
Leo, have you been working out?

56:25.807 --> 56:27.615
Let's not play
that charade today.

56:27.791 --> 56:28.596
What?

56:28.728 --> 56:31.161
I gave up my planeswalkers
to get that picture.

56:31.547 --> 56:32.809
Dungeons & Dragons?

56:32.810 --> 56:34.441
- It's magic cards.
- Magic cards.

56:34.442 --> 56:37.402
Planeswalkers...Travel
through planes of existence.

56:37.659 --> 56:38.852
And they're very hard to get.

56:38.853 --> 56:39.973
Interesting.

56:41.899 --> 56:42.426
Just...

56:42.427 --> 56:43.546
Just say thank you.

56:44.533 --> 56:45.973
Is that a new sweater vest?

56:46.969 --> 56:48.185
You never say thank you.

56:49.088 --> 56:50.143
That's not true.

56:57.077 --> 56:58.053
Thank you.

57:07.310 --> 57:08.302
Kate.

57:09.012 --> 57:10.294
Hey, Lauren.

57:11.651 --> 57:12.787
What?

57:13.607 --> 57:14.744
You wanna give me a raise?

57:16.259 --> 57:19.294
Oh! No, you are willing to admit

57:19.295 --> 57:21.887
that lawyers burn bridges
and mediators build them.

57:23.274 --> 57:25.752
You wanna congratulate me on
turning the Pease situation

57:25.753 --> 57:28.168
into a win-win. Oh, Lauren...

57:28.526 --> 57:30.337
Your father's ashes are missing.

57:30.527 --> 57:31.599
Really?

57:31.960 --> 57:34.785
You lost the Connelly account
and my father's ashes?

57:36.932 --> 57:37.989
Lose-lose!

58:47.044 --> 58:48.004
Kate?

58:48.723 --> 58:50.547
Hello! It's me.

58:51.576 --> 58:52.487
Hi.

58:52.916 --> 58:55.013
Uh...lt's late.

58:55.237 --> 58:56.181
Did I wake you?

58:59.096 --> 59:00.087
Hold on.

59:09.146 --> 59:10.107
Hey.

59:13.483 --> 59:16.778
So you must have really put
the screws to Douglas Pease.

59:17.050 --> 59:18.986
He pushed me really
hard to let that kid go.

59:19.347 --> 59:20.659
What'd you have on him?

59:21.706 --> 59:23.728
Sometimes people just
do the right thing.

59:24.870 --> 59:26.182
No, they don't.

59:26.710 --> 59:28.135
Not until you make 'em.

59:29.879 --> 59:31.816
You know, you don't have
to live out here, Kate.

59:31.817 --> 59:33.083
You took a bad settlement.

59:33.084 --> 59:34.109
Mm.

59:34.963 --> 59:36.627
I don't like conflict.

59:38.923 --> 59:41.341
Well, I'm just saying,
I could spot you a year's rent.

59:41.342 --> 59:42.991
You know, you can move
back in the neighborhood.

59:42.992 --> 59:44.784
No! No, no.

59:44.785 --> 59:46.400
I-I like it here.

59:46.401 --> 59:47.790
- Really.
- Yeah.

59:48.273 --> 59:49.505
I have friends.

59:50.855 --> 59:51.803
Hi.

59:52.260 --> 59:53.474
How are you this evening?

59:54.683 --> 59:56.829
Oh... well, they're shy friends.

59:57.821 --> 01:00:00.176
Can I, uh, you know,
come onboard?

01:00:00.177 --> 01:00:02.080
- We could talk.
- I have company.

01:00:03.554 --> 01:00:05.986
Wow. Hmm.

01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:08.483
New tin man?

01:00:11.251 --> 01:00:12.339
Sorry.

01:00:12.779 --> 01:00:14.429
No, I'm sorry. It's not my place.

01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:16.451
You know, uh,
maybe another time.

01:00:16.452 --> 01:00:17.495
You know what,
coffee or something.

01:00:17.496 --> 01:00:19.283
- Coffee...
- Maybe. Okay.

01:00:19.284 --> 01:00:20.261
Yeah.

01:00:21.771 --> 01:00:22.736
We'll do that.

01:00:22.737 --> 01:00:24.346
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:00:24.347 --> 01:00:25.579
- Good night.
- Yep.

01:00:29.587 --> 01:00:30.541
Hey, Justin?

01:00:32.043 --> 01:00:33.195
Yeah?

01:00:34.839 --> 01:00:36.439
Dad thought that you were great.

01:00:38.205 --> 01:00:39.981
Maybe even a little
too good for me.

01:00:42.417 --> 01:00:43.648
Well, he was half-right.

01:00:46.098 --> 01:00:47.011
Good night.

01:00:47.921 --> 01:00:49.025
Good night.

01:01:09.303 --> 01:01:11.681
Okay. Um...

01:01:12.421 --> 01:01:14.948
Let's focus on...

01:01:14.949 --> 01:01:16.325
What we have in common.

01:01:17.239 --> 01:01:20.374
We...Both have the
same sense of humor.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.960
And nobody has my sense of humor.

01:01:25.016 --> 01:01:26.343
We, um...

01:01:27.877 --> 01:01:29.168
Ah, yes.

01:01:29.169 --> 01:01:31.120
We agree on the important stuff.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.351
And that's important.

01:01:35.473 --> 01:01:36.705
Um...

01:01:36.879 --> 01:01:39.007
We both have strong beliefs.

01:01:40.288 --> 01:01:42.177
You believe in the
letter of the law.

01:01:42.793 --> 01:01:44.601
It's absolute. It's always right.

01:01:46.093 --> 01:01:49.261
And I believe that laws
were made by people...

01:01:51.272 --> 01:01:52.968
And that people are often wrong.
