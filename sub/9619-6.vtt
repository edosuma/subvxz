{\an1}IN FRONT

00:03.920 --> 00:06.506
{\an1}OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.589 --> 00:06.840
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MAD STYLE,

00:06.923 --> 00:09.175
{\an1}HOW MAY I DIRECT YOUR CALL?

00:11.052 --> 00:11.761
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MORNING, TRUE.

00:11.845 --> 00:12.887

{\an1}A WHOLE BUNCH BETTER

00:14.055 --> 00:15.807

00:15.890 --> 00:17.058
{\an1}&gt;&gt; UM. I HEAR THAT.

00:17.142 --> 00:17.892
{\an1}THIS MORNING I WAS WALKING

00:17.976 --> 00:18.476
{\an1}DOWN THE STREET

00:18.560 --> 00:19.144
{\an1}AND A FLOWER POT

00:19.227 --> 00:21.104
{\an1}FELL ON MY HEAD.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.856
{\an1}THEN, I GOT SO DIZZY,

00:22.939 --> 00:26.109
{\an1}I TOPPLED INTO AN OPEN MANHOLE.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.569
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ARE YOU OKAY?

00:27.652 --> 00:28.278
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BETTER THAN THE SEWER WORKER

00:28.361 --> 00:31.531
{\an1}I FELL ON.

00:31.614 --> 00:33.366
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OSCAR, I THINK I LEFT MY KEYS

00:33.450 --> 00:34.492
{\an1}IN THE DRESS VAULT.

00:34.576 --> 00:34.951
{\an1}CAN YOU HAVE SOMEONE

00:35.034 --> 00:35.910
{\an1}CHECK FOR ME?

00:35.994 --> 00:36.202
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WILL DO.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.871
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING, MR. MADIGAN.

00:37.954 --> 00:38.705
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MORNING, TRUE.

00:38.788 --> 00:39.205
{\an1}HOW'S YOUR DESIGN

00:39.289 --> 00:40.623
{\an1}FOR THE NEW TEEN COUTURE LINE

00:40.707 --> 00:41.332
{\an1}COMING?

00:41.416 --> 00:41.708
{\an1}&gt;&gt; PRETTY GOOD.

00:41.791 --> 00:43.960
{\an1}I'M HOPING TO BE DONE BY MONDAY.

00:44.043 --> 00:44.794
{\an1}&gt;&gt; EXCELLENT.

00:44.878 --> 00:45.754
{\an1}EVERYTHING ELSE GOOD?

00:45.837 --> 00:46.504
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SO FAR.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.339
{\an1}BUT TODAY IS FRIDAY THE 13th.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.132
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TELL ME ABOUT IT.

00:49.215 --> 00:49.841
{\an1}THIS MORNING,

00:49.924 --> 00:50.633
{\an1}I ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED

00:50.717 --> 00:51.134
{\an1}MY FAVORITE FLOWER POT

00:51.217 --> 00:56.514
{\an1}OUT THE WINDOW.

00:56.723 --> 01:00.685
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY RYAN. HEY LULU.

01:00.769 --> 01:01.186
{\an1}I CAN'T BELIEVE TODAY

01:01.269 --> 01:02.479
{\an1}IS FRIDAY THE 13th.

01:02.562 --> 01:03.062
{\an1}I MEAN, I'VE BEEN

01:03.146 --> 01:04.397
{\an1}ON A LUCKY STREAK HERE.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.232
{\an1}BUT NOW--I KNOW,

01:06.316 --> 01:06.733
{\an1}YOU PROBABLY JUST THINK

01:06.816 --> 01:11.404
{\an1}I'M BEING SUPERSTITIOUS, RIGHT?

01:11.488 --> 01:11.988
{\an1}DO YOU EVER THINK

01:12.071 --> 01:14.991
{\an1}YOU SPEND TOO MUCH TIME TEXTING?

01:15.074 --> 01:17.494
{\an1}WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO, ANYWAY?

01:17.577 --> 01:18.077
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RYAN.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.204
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LULU.

01:19.287 --> 01:21.122
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

01:21.206 --> 01:22.832
{\an1}YOU'RE IN THE SAME ROOM.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.334
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WE ARE?

01:24.417 --> 01:26.503
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

01:26.586 --> 01:28.046
{\an1}&gt;&gt; A WHILE AGO.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.380
{\an1}MY BAD, I SHOULD'VE TEXTED YOU.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.674
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH.

01:31.758 --> 01:32.175
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT WERE YOU GUYS

01:32.258 --> 01:33.092
{\an1}TALKING ABOUT ANYWAY?

01:33.176 --> 01:33.843
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I GOT INVITED

{\an1}TO A SUMMER DANCE

01:34.511 --> 01:35.970

01:36.054 --> 01:36.387
{\an1}IT'S REALLY CALLED

01:36.471 --> 01:37.013
{\an1}HANSON ACADEMY,

01:37.096 --> 01:40.517
{\an1}BUT ALL THE BOYS ARE SOOOO CUTE.

01:40.600 --> 01:45.021
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AND I SOOOO DON'T CARE.

01:45.104 --> 01:46.189
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHO INVITED YOU?

01:46.272 --> 01:47.315
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MY COUSIN DANNY.

01:47.398 --> 01:47.732
{\an1}I'M NOT REALLY SURE

01:47.816 --> 01:48.107
{\an1}HOW WE GOT IN.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.442
{\an1}HE LOOKS LIKE

01:49.526 --> 01:51.736
{\an1}A CARTOON CHARACTER.

01:51.820 --> 01:52.195
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU SAID I LOOK

01:52.278 --> 01:54.948
{\an1}LIKE YOUR COUSIN DANNY.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, THAT'S MY OTHER COUSIN

01:55.824 --> 01:59.244

02:16.261 --> 02:18.513
{\an1}I HAVE WAY TOO MUCH WORK TO DO.

02:18.596 --> 02:19.848
{\an1}ALL THE PLEASES IN THE WORLD

02:19.931 --> 02:22.642

{\an1}I KEEP HEARING ABOUT SOME SORT

02:28.356 --> 02:30.775

{\an1}&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE IT IS.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.661
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHY NOT?

02:41.744 --> 02:42.370
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'VE ONLY WORKED HERE

02:42.453 --> 02:42.745

{\an1}WHERE THE BATHROOM IS.

02:45.540 --> 02:48.793
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THIS PLACE HAS A BATHROOM?

02:48.877 --> 02:49.627
{\an1}THEN WHY HAVE I BEEN WALKING

02:49.711 --> 02:50.545
{\an1}TO THE DELI ON THE CORNER

02:50.628 --> 02:52.797
{\an1}SIX TIMES A DAY.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.382
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SIX TIMES A DAY? WHAT?

02:54.465 --> 02:54.841
{\an1}DO YOU HAVE A BLADDER

{\an1}THE SIZE OF A PEA?

02:56.384 --> 02:57.802
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, WHY DO YOU HAVE

02:57.886 --> 02:58.219

{\an1}&gt;&gt; THERE YOU ARE.

03:03.933 --> 03:06.811
{\an1}YOU ARE IN BIG TROUBLE, MISTER.

03:06.895 --> 03:07.270
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE THE ODDS

03:07.353 --> 03:08.396
{\an1}SHE'S TALKING TO YOU?

03:08.479 --> 03:09.397
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ZERO.

03:09.480 --> 03:10.607
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF.

03:10.690 --> 03:10.773
{\an1}HI.

03:10.857 --> 03:11.983
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THE VENDING MACHINE

03:12.066 --> 03:13.735
{\an1}IN THE BREAK ROOM IS BROKEN.

03:13.818 --> 03:16.279
{\an1}ANY IDEA WHO'S RESPONSIBLE?

03:16.362 --> 03:17.155
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHOA.

03:17.238 --> 03:18.740
{\an1}YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING

03:18.823 --> 03:21.743
{\an1}THAT I DID IT, ARE YOU?

03:21.826 --> 03:23.369
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.705
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE ME

03:25.788 --> 03:26.831
{\an1}OF SOMETHING WITHOUT EVEN

03:26.915 --> 03:29.667
{\an1}A SPECK OF PROOF?

03:29.751 --> 03:30.752
{\an1}THAT COULD BE ANYONE'S.

03:30.835 --> 03:31.961
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT SAYS "PROPERTY OF RYAN"

03:32.045 --> 03:33.796
{\an1}ON IT.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.548
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT COULD BE ANY RYAN.

03:35.632 --> 03:38.301
{\an1}LULU KNOWS TWO DANNYS.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.929
{\an1}BESIDES,

03:41.012 --> 03:41.471
{\an1}I DON'T EVEN PLAY HOCKEY.

03:41.554 --> 03:42.680
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU'RE WEARING

03:42.764 --> 03:44.891
{\an1}A HOCKEY JERSEY.

03:44.974 --> 03:46.768
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, WAS THAT WHAT THIS IS?

03:46.851 --> 03:49.729
{\an1}MY GRANDMOTHER KNIT IT FOR ME.

03:49.812 --> 03:50.438
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY, AMANDA,

03:50.521 --> 03:51.397
{\an1}WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

03:51.481 --> 03:51.814
{\an1}BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

03:51.898 --> 03:52.357
{\an1}THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME

03:52.440 --> 03:54.275
{\an1}HE'S DONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

03:54.359 --> 03:55.693
{\an1}HE'S THE REASON

03:55.777 --> 03:56.653
{\an1}WE DON'T HAVE VENDING MACHINES

03:56.736 --> 03:57.487
{\an1}IN SCHOOL.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.113
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OR A SCHOOL MASCOT?

03:59.197 --> 03:59.906
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, OKAY.

03:59.989 --> 04:00.406

04:08.414 --> 04:09.415
{\an1}I COME IN HERE,

04:09.499 --> 04:11.084
{\an1}I BETTER BE ABLE TO BUY A BAG

04:11.167 --> 04:16.172
{\an1}OF ZESTY RANCH HEALTH DOODLES.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.048

06:01.402 --> 06:03.905
{\an1}"JIMMY AND THE FRIENDLIES."

06:03.988 --> 06:05.114
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OR "FIRE AND ICE."

06:05.198 --> 06:06.032
{\an1}THAT'S THE BAND I'D SEE.

06:06.115 --> 06:07.241

{\an1}CAN I BORROW IT?

08:44.232 --> 08:44.524

{\an1}&gt;&gt; DIARRHEA?

10:04.854 --> 10:05.146
{\an1}&gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE

10:05.229 --> 10:06.272
{\an1}THEY HAVE A GROSS NAME

10:06.355 --> 10:08.024
{\an1}DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE NOT GOOD.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.066
{\an1}AND JIMMY WOULD BE PSYCHED

10:09.150 --> 10:09.650
{\an1}TO PLAY.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.319
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.153
{\an1}WILL YOU TALK TO HIM?

10:28.044 --> 10:28.794
{\an1}HOW WOULD YOUR BAND

10:33.883 --> 10:39.013
{\an1}THAT'D BE AMAZING.

10:39.096 --> 10:43.601
{\an1}I GOT TO CALL THE GUYS.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.561

10:49.231 --> 10:49.815
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OSCAR, WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:49.899 --> 10:50.524
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THERE'S BEEN

10:50.608 --> 10:50.941
{\an1}A SECURITY BREACH

10:51.025 --> 10:51.400
{\an1}IN THE DRESS VAULT.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.195
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THERE WAS WHAT NOW?

10:54.278 --> 10:54.612
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SOMEONE TRIPPED

10:54.695 --> 10:55.446
{\an1}ONE OF THE DRESS VAULT'S

10:55.529 --> 10:57.406
{\an1}INVISIBLE LASER SENSORS.

10:58.657 --> 11:00.576
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES.

11:00.659 --> 11:01.327
{\an1}AND APPARENTLY,

11:01.410 --> 11:01.869
{\an1}SOMEONE REMOVED

11:01.952 --> 11:02.745
{\an1}ONE OF THE PROTOTYPES.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.163
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT'S THAT?

11:04.246 --> 11:05.414
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S ONE-OF-A-KIND DRESS

11:05.498 --> 11:05.998
{\an1}THAT HASN'T BEEN PUT

11:06.082 --> 11:07.083
{\an1}INTO PRODUCTION YET.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.210
{\an1}I MEAN, IT'S IRREPLACEABLE.

11:09.293 --> 11:09.710
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DON'T YOU THINK

11:09.794 --> 11:11.212
{\an1}YOU'RE BEING A LITTLE DRAMATIC?

11:11.295 --> 11:13.339
{\an1}I MEAN, I'M JUST GUESSING HERE.

11:13.422 --> 11:14.215
{\an1}THIS DRESS PROBABLY

11:14.298 --> 11:14.757
{\an1}WASN'T ONE-OF-A-KIND.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.093
{\an1}I BET THERE WAS AN IDENTICAL ONE

11:17.176 --> 11:17.676
{\an1}HANGING RIGHT BEHIND IT.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.637
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, THERE DEFINITELY WAS.

11:19.720 --> 11:20.262

11:20.679 --> 11:21.972
{\an1}THE PATTERN DRESS.

11:22.056 --> 11:22.431

11:22.515 --> 11:22.807
{\an1}OF THE PROTOTYPE

11:22.890 --> 11:28.646
{\an1}BUT IT'S NOT EVEN SEWN TOGETHER.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.398
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AS YOU ALL KNOW,

11:30.481 --> 11:32.566
{\an1}THE PROTOTYPE IS SO TOP SECRET

11:32.650 --> 11:33.234
{\an1}THAT WE CAN'T ALLOW IT

11:33.317 --> 11:34.318
{\an1}TO BE SEEN BY ANYONE

12:20.865 --> 12:21.866
{\an1}BUT REST ASSURED--

12:27.663 --> 12:28.164
{\an1}PAYING MORE ATTENTION

12:28.247 --> 12:36.714

{\an1}YOU GAVE THEM A RUNWAY SHOW

12:37.798 --> 12:39.717
{\an1}THEY'LL NEVER FORGET.

12:40.509 --> 12:41.886
{\an1}HUMILIATING MOMENT OF MY LIFE.

12:41.969 --> 12:42.845
{\an1}I CAN'T BELIEVE KOPELMAN

12:42.928 --> 12:45.055
{\an1}SAW ME NAKED.

12:50.853 --> 12:51.729
{\an1}WHO'S RESPONSIBLE--

12:51.812 --> 12:53.439

{\an1}GIRL, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

13:19.965 --> 13:20.925

{\an1}TODAY'S SECURITY VIDEOS

14:05.177 --> 14:06.220

14:10.558 --> 14:10.891
{\an1}IS THERE A BUTTON

14:10.975 --> 14:11.517
{\an1}THAT MIGHT ERASE

14:11.600 --> 14:12.476
{\an1}THIS WHOLE THING?

14:12.560 --> 14:13.269
{\an1}YOU KNOW, JUST SO I DON'T

14:13.352 --> 14:15.938
{\an1}ACCIDENTALLY PUSH IT.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU WANNA TELL ME

14:17.481 --> 14:20.609
{\an1}WHAT HAPPENED?

{\an1}THE WORSE IT GETS?

14:28.075 --> 14:30.786
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RED BUTTON.

14:30.869 --> 14:30.995
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT?

14:31.078 --> 14:34.290
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THE RED BUTTON ERASES THINGS.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.374
{\an1}WELL, I THINK

14:35.457 --> 14:41.630
{\an1}I'LL TAKE MY BREAK NOW.

14:41.839 --> 14:51.890
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AT LEAST SOMEBODY

{\an1}IN THE ACT, SHALL WE?

14:59.773 --> 14:59.982

15:00.065 --> 15:00.983
{\an1}THE RED BUTTON'S REWIND.

15:01.066 --> 15:06.947
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, YOU DO, DO YOU?

15:07.156 --> 15:10.075
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I CAN EXPLAIN.

15:10.159 --> 15:10.534
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU TOOK THE DRESS

15:10.618 --> 15:12.077

15:16.206 --> 15:17.249
{\an1}IT WAS A PROTOTYPE.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.125
{\an1}I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD

15:18.208 --> 15:19.627

15:20.878 --> 15:21.253
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, I BELIEVE YOU.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.921
{\an1}I BELIEVE YOU'LL BE FIRED

15:23.005 --> 15:24.673
{\an1}ONCE MAX FINDS OUT.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.675
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I KNOW AND I SHOULD BE.

15:26.759 --> 15:26.925
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WE NEED

15:27.009 --> 15:27.384
{\an1}TO GET THE DRESS BACK

15:27.468 --> 15:29.178
{\an1}BEFORE ANYONE SEES IT.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.721
{\an1}WHERE IS IT NOW?

15:30.804 --> 15:31.138

15:31.221 --> 15:31.597
{\an1}YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE

{\an1}YOU CAN DRIVE.

15:38.228 --> 15:40.064

15:40.147 --> 15:41.190
{\an1}ONE TIME MY DAD LET ME DRIVE

15:41.273 --> 15:42.399

15:44.026 --> 15:44.485

{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'M NOT JUMPING

16:09.176 --> 16:09.802
{\an1}ON TRUE'S COUCH

16:09.885 --> 16:10.052
{\an1}IF THAT'S

16:10.135 --> 16:10.886
{\an1}WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING.

16:10.969 --> 16:12.221

16:15.474 --> 16:16.100
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I FEEL A SENSE

16:16.183 --> 16:17.559
{\an1}THAT YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING,

16:17.643 --> 16:18.310

{\an1}&gt;&gt; JUST GIVE ME A LITTLE HINT.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.775
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I CAN'T.

16:24.858 --> 16:25.192
{\an1}TRUE WOULD KILL ME

16:25.275 --> 16:25.984
{\an1}IF I TOLD YOU THAT LULU

16:26.068 --> 16:26.902
{\an1}IS WEARING THE PROTOTYPE DRESS

16:26.985 --> 16:28.070
