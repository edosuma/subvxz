WEBVTT

00:07.384 --> 00:09.511
Keep an eye out
for her dearly beloved.

00:09.678 --> 00:11.721
Little bird told me
Shadow's on his way.

00:12.764 --> 00:14.516
I just need to get to Cairo.

00:14.683 --> 00:17.352
- It's Cay-row.
- It's Cay--? Cay-row?

00:18.395 --> 00:20.230
I was old in the desert

00:20.397 --> 00:22.857
before they sacrificed
the first horse to you.

00:23.483 --> 00:25.276
I will be heard.

00:25.443 --> 00:29.072
I wonder,
if you don't choose a side,

00:29.239 --> 00:31.574
will you be
trampled by both?

00:33.952 --> 00:35.870
Mrs. Moon and I have a date

00:36.037 --> 00:37.789
with my old friend Argus.

00:37.956 --> 00:40.291
The man with all the eyes,
Argus Penoptes.

00:40.458 --> 00:41.918
I need you
to kill him.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.586
He's been playing both sides

00:43.753 --> 00:45.630
and I need to get him
off the field.

00:45.797 --> 00:47.757
He dies, your coin recharges.

00:47.924 --> 00:49.843
Live to see the future

00:50.009 --> 00:52.887
with Shadow that you've put
so much unearned faith in.

00:53.054 --> 00:56.224
I told Argus to upgrade
this hub eons ago!

00:56.391 --> 00:59.269
Get your man in line!

01:00.145 --> 01:01.855
Um, guys?

01:02.939 --> 01:04.190
Never mind.

04:21.638 --> 04:24.432
♪ ...baby. Rock!
Let's rock, yeah. ♪

04:26.309 --> 04:29.896
♪ ...about the dangers and
the pressures and the deeds ♪

04:30.063 --> 04:32.315

04:41.115 --> 04:42.158
Listen.

04:58.049 --> 05:00.468
- I know Bach.
- Listen.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.265
He'd only just returned
from a trip

05:06.432 --> 05:08.184
to find that his wife had died.

05:09.227 --> 05:11.104
Bach had already lost
three children.

05:12.814 --> 05:14.607
He would lose
seven more.

05:17.777 --> 05:19.278
This is grief.

05:20.405 --> 05:21.489
And yet...

05:23.533 --> 05:25.243
The rising notes
of joy...

05:26.953 --> 05:28.871
...shattering his own rules.

05:30.790 --> 05:32.166
Can you hear it?

05:36.462 --> 05:38.715
This is how men like me pray.

05:46.973 --> 05:48.766
♪ Why go out? ♪

05:48.933 --> 05:52.603
♪ Why go home? Why go out? ♪

06:28.056 --> 06:29.474
Play it again.

07:18.689 --> 07:19.857
This is...

07:22.068 --> 07:24.654
It's beautiful, like Bach.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.616
You composed this?

07:28.783 --> 07:31.244
Well, I-I created the engine
that did.

07:31.911 --> 07:35.164
I translated all of Bach's
cantatas into a database

07:35.331 --> 07:37.291
then wrote a program
that segmented the notes

07:37.458 --> 07:39.001
into digital objects

07:39.168 --> 07:42.672
the way that Bach statistically
intended to. Um...

07:46.759 --> 07:50.596
But everything it created was
mechanical, artificial.

07:50.763 --> 07:52.974
The real insight was
in programming

07:53.141 --> 07:56.102
violations
to the predictable variations.

07:57.603 --> 08:00.565
I gave it permission
to shatter the rules.

08:02.775 --> 08:04.527
The computer composed this?

08:05.528 --> 08:06.863
Yeah.

08:14.912 --> 08:16.747
It's writing more now.

10:22.164 --> 10:24.083
I'm glad you came.

10:40.850 --> 10:42.560
No, no, no, no.

10:43.602 --> 10:46.397
My wife,
she'll kill you.

11:11.255 --> 11:12.590
Not me.

12:05.309 --> 12:07.144
Let it happen.

12:46.183 --> 12:47.518
Now rest.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.322
Let it go.

14:13.229 --> 14:14.563
Good morning.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.525
Did you sleep well?

14:19.818 --> 14:21.111
Huh?

14:22.696 --> 14:24.323
Did you sleep well?

14:27.743 --> 14:29.036
Well, there was...

14:29.203 --> 14:30.246
Well...

14:33.040 --> 14:35.709
Yeah. Yeah, it was good.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.419
Good.

14:47.179 --> 14:51.433
So, this is a coroner's office?

14:51.600 --> 14:55.354
Coroners are a political
appointment around here.

14:55.521 --> 14:57.982
His job is to kick the corpse.

14:58.148 --> 15:01.110
If it doesn't kick him back,
he signs the death certificate.

15:01.277 --> 15:03.904
I'm what they call a prosector.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.864
I work for the county
medical examiner.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.449
I do autopsies and save

15:07.616 --> 15:09.577
tissue samples for analysis.

15:09.952 --> 15:12.204
In addition, we are
a funeral parlor,

15:12.371 --> 15:15.541
serving Cairo, Illinois,
since 1863

15:15.708 --> 15:19.086
when it was a flourishing town
at the crossing of two rivers.

15:20.170 --> 15:22.715
We could go back much longer
than that, of course,

15:22.881 --> 15:24.800
but it wasn't until
the War Between the States

15:24.967 --> 15:26.760
that we found our niche.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.846
That was when we became
the funeral parlor

15:29.013 --> 15:30.764
for the colored folks
hereabouts.

15:37.771 --> 15:41.734
Before that, no one
thought of us as colored...

15:42.943 --> 15:47.448
Foreign maybe, exotic and dark,
but not colored.

15:48.198 --> 15:51.577
And it's strange, when they talk
about African Americans.

15:51.952 --> 15:54.413
My colleagues and I never
thought of ourselves as African.

15:54.580 --> 15:57.249
We were the people of the Nile.

15:59.960 --> 16:03.172
And then you settle in a town
called Cairo?

16:03.339 --> 16:04.923
Seems appropriate.

16:05.090 --> 16:07.509
Mm. Chicken. Egg.

16:18.395 --> 16:19.730
Was there, uh...

16:21.065 --> 16:22.941
Was there anyone else around?

16:24.818 --> 16:27.946
She's not here. Your wife.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.701
You know where she is?

16:37.831 --> 16:39.375
No.

16:40.876 --> 16:42.461
Mr. Ibis, please.

16:44.338 --> 16:46.674
They're different
when they come back.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.260
Like any formative
life experience,

16:50.427 --> 16:52.763
death changes you.

16:55.766 --> 16:57.434
I'm sure your wife is lovely,

16:57.601 --> 17:00.437
but she's not the same
person she was.

17:04.983 --> 17:06.652
Good. You're up!

17:06.819 --> 17:08.737
So, should we seize the day

17:08.904 --> 17:12.032
by the ass before she finds
a new dance partner?

17:13.033 --> 17:14.910
And then,
where would we be, huh?

17:15.786 --> 17:18.872
Like floral patterns on a wall.

17:20.332 --> 17:22.251
Oh!

17:22.418 --> 17:24.795
What a beautiful day
for a drive, Shadow.

17:26.171 --> 17:28.340
Did you get a
good night's sleep, huh?

17:29.091 --> 17:32.261
Time to heal your wounds?
Someone to lick your wounds? Mm?

17:33.929 --> 17:36.265
I need to find Laura.
She's around here somewhere.

17:36.432 --> 17:38.350
I don't know why, it's weird,
but I feel it.

17:38.517 --> 17:40.436
Only humans could've
come up with monogamy.

17:40.602 --> 17:43.313
An unnatural concept.
Enjoy your life, my boy.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.940
Fuck it, embrace it,

17:45.107 --> 17:46.859
exercise neither temperance
nor restraint,

17:47.025 --> 17:48.694
and leave the past
where it belongs:

17:48.861 --> 17:51.989
in the past.
Now, forward to St. Louis.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.700
What's in St. Louis?

17:55.242 --> 17:58.120
Big city, big money.

17:58.287 --> 18:00.372
Betty here doesn't run on
butterflies and wishes.

18:01.123 --> 18:04.209
Money is the most influential
god in America.

18:04.376 --> 18:07.171
Untouchable asshole,
but his stock never falls.

18:47.878 --> 18:49.588
How you know Gramma?

18:50.756 --> 18:52.174
You friends with Ida?

18:52.341 --> 18:54.134
Who's Ida?

18:54.301 --> 18:55.803
My mother.

18:59.056 --> 19:03.435
You look city, so I thought
maybe you came here with her.

19:04.770 --> 19:05.896
No.

19:07.898 --> 19:09.316
No. Figures.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.069
She's not coming
down here.

19:14.571 --> 19:17.699
So, what, you just
here touristing?

19:18.492 --> 19:20.536
I came for a man
named Shadow.

19:23.413 --> 19:24.581
Oh.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.168
I'm sorry
for your loss.

19:37.052 --> 19:38.762
This casket is empty.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.183
They've got her in the back.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.269
The service is in a day or two.

19:45.435 --> 19:47.563
Then who do you pray to?

19:48.772 --> 19:50.691
Reverend Hutchins says

19:50.858 --> 19:53.527
that all things are
a matter of ideas.

19:55.112 --> 19:58.198
And God is just one idea.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.910
The good reverend enjoys
the theatre.

20:04.037 --> 20:07.165
- He's quoting Beneatha.
- Who?

20:07.332 --> 20:09.543
Beneatha grew tired of God

20:09.710 --> 20:12.796
getting credit for all the
things the human race achieves

20:12.963 --> 20:14.590
through stubborn effort.

20:15.841 --> 20:17.926
Beneatha is the daughter
and nonbeliever

20:18.093 --> 20:20.178
from A Raisin in the Sun.

20:23.098 --> 20:25.809
A woman's heart should never be
so hidden in God

20:25.976 --> 20:28.437
that she cannot
hear her own truth.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.610
According to Maya Angelou,

20:34.776 --> 20:36.111
a woman's heart

20:37.070 --> 20:38.864
should be hidden in God

20:40.657 --> 20:44.202
so that a man has to seek Him

20:45.120 --> 20:47.414
just to find her.

20:48.165 --> 20:50.417
My faith is of a different kind.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.920
Must be, the way your ass is
crisscrossing back and forth,

20:53.086 --> 20:54.922
across the battlefield.

20:55.339 --> 20:58.050
Hither, tither, and yon

20:58.717 --> 21:00.552
in the middle of a war.

21:00.719 --> 21:03.347
Like you ain't
got a care in the world.

21:03.513 --> 21:05.724
You need not fear me.

21:05.891 --> 21:08.644
World would've had
an easier time convincing me

21:08.810 --> 21:10.938
to join him
if he had not killed Zorya.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.107
Make sure Wednesday understands.

21:17.110 --> 21:20.781
So, you crisscrossing and
stepping in the name of love?

21:20.948 --> 21:22.866
Would you prefer I hide
in a foxhole and wait

21:23.033 --> 21:25.202
until things
are more to your liking?

21:26.161 --> 21:28.038
I'd need to carefully consider

21:28.914 --> 21:30.916
all the pros and the cons

21:31.750 --> 21:34.044
before I could honestly answer
that question.

21:35.379 --> 21:38.006
So, uh, you two know each other?

21:39.007 --> 21:40.092
Yes.

21:41.426 --> 21:42.803
Biblically.

21:51.561 --> 21:53.063
You're nervous.

21:54.731 --> 21:56.316
The fuck I am.

21:58.694 --> 22:00.028
I need you.

22:00.862 --> 22:02.990
You need me.

22:18.422 --> 22:20.424
Were you there when
Media died?

22:20.590 --> 22:22.843
Oh, don't be so
aggressively dense.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.053
She didn't die.

22:25.220 --> 22:27.806
She changed into you.

22:29.307 --> 22:31.560
I still feel her inside me.

22:32.352 --> 22:36.148
I wonder if the next version of
me will feel me inside of her?

22:36.314 --> 22:39.693
And then the next version
will feel all of us?

22:45.532 --> 22:47.325
Don't you wonder
about this stuff?

22:48.368 --> 22:49.870
Do you...

22:51.830 --> 22:55.167
You know the difference
between people and animals?

22:56.251 --> 22:57.586
Hmm?

22:59.629 --> 23:04.926
People are aware they're
going to die someday.

23:05.093 --> 23:08.138
And pray to the
Old Gods to stop it.

23:08.305 --> 23:13.101
But an animal is ignorant.

23:14.144 --> 23:15.854
I don't get your point.

23:16.021 --> 23:17.481
My point is Media

23:17.647 --> 23:21.485
is not a person or an animal.

23:21.651 --> 23:25.989
She, unlike you, understood
she's a fucking God.

23:55.143 --> 23:57.979
I trust you know why
I summoned you.

24:00.941 --> 24:03.985
Argus.
It's a setback, for sure.

24:04.152 --> 24:05.737
No!

24:07.572 --> 24:09.950
No, no.

24:10.117 --> 24:13.829
No more excuses.

24:14.663 --> 24:18.208
War is won...

24:19.209 --> 24:20.794
...with what?

24:20.961 --> 24:23.964
- Information.
- Information.

24:26.007 --> 24:30.637
Do you know what this is?

24:30.804 --> 24:32.514
Blindness.

24:32.681 --> 24:36.017
This is blindness.

24:36.810 --> 24:39.146
Can you please...

24:40.772 --> 24:44.234
...restore my sight?

24:44.818 --> 24:47.946
Oh! I've... ah! I've got
a plan, brand new network.

24:48.113 --> 24:49.948
Oh... I've got a plan!

24:50.115 --> 24:52.367
I've got a brand new network
that'll be faster than Argus.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.703
I've got a guy in Silicon
Valley who fucking owes me.

24:55.787 --> 24:58.665
It'll be a fucking upgrade.
Trust me!

25:27.194 --> 25:28.486

26:12.364 --> 26:14.908
- Yeah, you got me thinking.
- Ah.

26:15.075 --> 26:16.910
In 1933, Roosevelt took

26:17.077 --> 26:18.995
the United States
off the Gold Standard, right?

26:19.162 --> 26:21.081
- Yeah, so?
- So, you can't just go

26:21.248 --> 26:23.291
into a bank and redeem money
for gold or silver.

26:24.793 --> 26:27.379
You said money is the most
powerful god in America.

26:27.545 --> 26:29.339
But money isn't actually
worth anything.

26:31.591 --> 26:34.219
I have a piece of paper, hm?

26:36.263 --> 26:40.600
But I want this salt shaker.
You have the salt shaker.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.686
But you're willing
to take my piece of paper

26:42.852 --> 26:44.771
for your salt shaker.

26:44.938 --> 26:46.856
Now, why would you do that?

26:47.023 --> 26:48.817
Because...

26:48.984 --> 26:51.236
this isn't actually
a piece of paper; it's a story.

26:51.403 --> 26:55.323
And the story that you've heard
over and over and over again.

26:55.490 --> 26:57.659
And it's been drummed into you
that this is worth something.

26:57.826 --> 26:59.494
This is of value.

26:59.661 --> 27:02.580
No matter what country,
culture, or religion.

27:02.747 --> 27:06.334
The whole world loves... money.

27:07.502 --> 27:09.170
The greatest story ever told.

27:09.337 --> 27:11.339
So, Money.

27:11.506 --> 27:15.844
We get him on our side,
Mr. World won't mean shit. Oh.

27:16.011 --> 27:17.679
Grimnir.
What do you want?

27:17.846 --> 27:19.889
A cup of coffee would be nice.

27:21.349 --> 27:22.934
Don't you work in Wisconsin?

27:23.101 --> 27:25.145
I am at every Motel America.

27:25.312 --> 27:27.605
Entrepreneurship is not
some picnic.

27:27.772 --> 27:29.441
Mama-ji and her followers

27:29.607 --> 27:31.901
own more than half the motels
in America.

27:32.068 --> 27:34.195
And we don't achieve this
by sitting on our asses

27:34.362 --> 27:36.323
or grifting
about like this one.

27:36.489 --> 27:39.075
You think America was eager
to hand over her money bags

27:39.242 --> 27:41.494
to the hungry,
the tired, and the poor?

27:42.203 --> 27:44.205
We battle for every
goddamn scrap.

27:44.372 --> 27:46.124
You love it.

27:46.291 --> 27:48.376
Victory is sweet
on the tongue,

27:48.543 --> 27:51.546
and profit is sweet
on the pocket.

27:51.713 --> 27:54.799
But you miss the real battles,
don't you, Kali, eh?

27:54.966 --> 27:57.135
The screams and the cries.

27:57.677 --> 28:00.638
I recall the day
you slew Raktabija.

28:00.805 --> 28:03.475
The only sound that day was
the whisper of the wind

28:03.641 --> 28:06.561
whistling
through the blood-soaked grass.

28:07.645 --> 28:10.148
- We had a good time, huh?
- Mm.

28:26.206 --> 28:27.874
He will be the death of you.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.876
You know that, right?

28:32.712 --> 28:34.839
What'd she say?

28:39.928 --> 28:41.846
<i>Welcome. Please scan finger.</i>

28:59.155 --> 29:01.533
Eat a giant bag of dicks.

29:16.214 --> 29:17.257
Uh-huh...

29:24.097 --> 29:25.181
I...

29:26.724 --> 29:29.853
...hate you so much.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.002
Hello, friend.

29:56.004 --> 29:57.589
Hello, friend.

29:58.923 --> 30:00.967
I always thought
I might see you again.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.722
Are you here to show me
something new?

30:09.934 --> 30:12.103
It's time to get back
in the game.

30:13.271 --> 30:16.608
One-point-one-zero-two
pounds.

30:18.359 --> 30:20.069
Splenomegaly.

30:27.494 --> 30:29.579
Majesty.

30:30.622 --> 30:32.332
Greetings, Thoth.

30:32.499 --> 30:36.127
You are as lovely as ever.

30:36.294 --> 30:38.004
Liar.

30:38.171 --> 30:40.590
This country has not
been kind to my face.

30:41.341 --> 30:45.094
You are as perfect and
vibrant as the Euphrates.

30:47.555 --> 30:49.432
Your sister.

30:49.599 --> 30:51.392
It has been too long.

30:52.352 --> 30:53.853
Y'all done yet?

30:54.020 --> 30:56.439
'Cuz I'm gettin' bored
watchin' this bullshit.

30:56.606 --> 30:58.483
Why do we fight, Anansi?

30:59.192 --> 31:00.860
We have known each other
since infancy.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.820
We should be on the same side.

31:03.571 --> 31:05.907
I thought we were.
Are we not?

31:06.074 --> 31:07.575
Now, Anansi.

31:08.117 --> 31:11.287
She is one of us.
A survivor.

31:11.454 --> 31:13.206
You old as dirt, bird-beak.

31:13.373 --> 31:15.291
Why the fuck you didn't ride
the carousel?

31:15.458 --> 31:17.752
I choose peace.

31:20.755 --> 31:24.008
Egyptians told tales of
the sacred Book of Thoth,

31:24.175 --> 31:27.220
which contains
the secrets of the Gods

31:27.387 --> 31:30.390
and brings misery, pain,
and suffering

31:30.557 --> 31:32.600
to anyone who reads it.

31:33.101 --> 31:36.729
And grants a bird's-eye view
to he...

31:37.939 --> 31:39.607
..who writes it.

31:40.608 --> 31:43.987
I am old as dirt, and I have
seen things as you have.

31:44.737 --> 31:46.447
Why do you bring this...

31:47.240 --> 31:50.618
...rage to my doorstep?

31:51.744 --> 31:55.873
You ever notice how traveling
makes your mind roll thunder,

31:56.624 --> 31:59.252
like a train moving
down the track?

32:00.378 --> 32:03.172
Except you don't know where the
fuck that mind train is headed.

32:03.965 --> 32:06.509
And then, all of a sudden,
plop...

32:06.926 --> 32:09.137
an idea shits in your head.

32:09.304 --> 32:12.849
And you think that shit
smells good.

32:13.558 --> 32:17.937
Peace is a beautiful
but shitty idea.

32:19.063 --> 32:22.233
Only a Goddess can adorn
the sarcophagus of a God.

32:23.526 --> 32:26.237
So, help me understand what
these New Gods giveth

32:27.697 --> 32:29.157
and what they taketh away.

32:29.324 --> 32:31.242
Your thirst does not inspire

32:31.409 --> 32:33.911
our confidence,
only our curiosity.

32:38.833 --> 32:40.627
I am not a God

32:40.793 --> 32:42.712
in the sense that I can
tolerate exploitation,

32:42.879 --> 32:44.714
oppression, and repression.

32:44.881 --> 32:48.468
My worshippers know
freedom ain't free.

32:48.635 --> 32:50.928
They know
the most potent weapon

32:51.095 --> 32:53.014
of control for the oppressor

32:53.181 --> 32:55.808
is the mind of the oppressed.

32:55.975 --> 32:58.561
They know slavery
is not a condition.

32:59.896 --> 33:01.856
Slavery is a cult.

33:02.649 --> 33:05.818
Human trafficking is a cult.

33:05.985 --> 33:10.698
Slavery got a rebrand like
muthafuckin' the Alt Right.

33:12.033 --> 33:13.368
And... snatched.

33:14.994 --> 33:16.454
Another one gone.

33:18.539 --> 33:21.209
Every 30 seconds,
another chocolate-brown,

33:21.376 --> 33:24.754
caramel, yellow, high-yellow,
red bone, refugee girl

33:24.921 --> 33:29.008
with melanin in her skin
gets snatched.

33:30.718 --> 33:35.515
Every... thirty... seconds.

33:36.849 --> 33:38.559
And to make matters worse,

33:38.726 --> 33:42.021
these dazzling new plantation
owners built a pipeline

33:42.939 --> 33:46.025
to take our children
from school to prison

33:46.192 --> 33:48.152
quicker than a cut
can bleed.

33:49.320 --> 33:52.865
And the lucky ones go
from school to the NFL,

33:53.032 --> 33:55.201
where they don't even
let them niggahs take a knee.

33:56.619 --> 33:58.579
They've been programmed
from birth

33:58.746 --> 34:01.833
with shitty food options,
contaminated drinking water,

34:01.999 --> 34:04.001
gun violence, police brutality,

34:04.168 --> 34:07.255
and trauma after trauma
after trauma.

34:07.422 --> 34:10.174
PTSD? No therapy.

34:10.341 --> 34:12.927
Missing? No Amber Alert.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.178
Alone?

34:16.180 --> 34:17.390
Vulnerable.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.103
Snatched.

34:24.230 --> 34:25.857
Another one gone.

34:26.941 --> 34:28.609
I hear you, Brother.

34:28.776 --> 34:31.154
And I hear them.

34:33.030 --> 34:34.949
I hear each voice,

34:35.116 --> 34:38.703
and I write each name.

34:38.870 --> 34:40.788
We have lived
long enough to know

34:40.955 --> 34:43.207
these troubles are timeless.

34:43.374 --> 34:46.002
Suffering is not sacred.

34:46.169 --> 34:48.463
And moral law is final.

34:48.629 --> 34:53.885
Sooner or later
they all lay before me.

34:57.180 --> 34:59.015
War need not be the answer.

35:09.484 --> 35:10.526
My Queen.

35:12.236 --> 35:15.406
The world assumes white people
are naturally good.

35:16.866 --> 35:18.618
So when something bad happens,

35:18.785 --> 35:22.872
it's a good person doing
a bad thing.

35:23.039 --> 35:25.124
They assume black people...

35:26.250 --> 35:28.169
are naturally bad,

35:28.336 --> 35:31.172
so when something good happens,
it's only a matter of time

35:31.339 --> 35:33.466
before
that animal's true nature

35:33.633 --> 35:36.385
rears its ugly head.

35:37.011 --> 35:39.722
How much longer
can we afford to wait?

35:41.307 --> 35:43.935
You keep track of days,
numbering the years for scribes

35:44.101 --> 35:46.187
that record human history.

35:47.313 --> 35:48.856
Do you see progress?

35:50.483 --> 35:54.487
I count 1, 2, 3
African Gods in this room,

35:55.279 --> 35:57.573
and two of them want
to exercise restraint,

35:58.115 --> 36:00.243
and let the donkey-work continue

36:00.409 --> 36:03.579
while you live your best life!

36:04.705 --> 36:07.041
War is upon us!

36:07.708 --> 36:10.503
An old white
lady is dead.

36:11.879 --> 36:14.757
Wednesday avenges
Zorya Vechernyaya,

36:14.924 --> 36:17.051
but if it was
a dead black lady,

36:19.011 --> 36:20.888
like this sweet old soul,

36:22.807 --> 36:24.392
Czernobog's hammer...

36:27.103 --> 36:28.563
...would not swing.

36:33.276 --> 36:35.486
Your words move me, Anansi.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.490
You see me.

36:40.491 --> 36:42.493
You and Ibis see the Goddess,

36:43.953 --> 36:45.246
the Queen.

36:46.330 --> 36:48.875
These men today look
right through me.

37:06.517 --> 37:08.728
This country has done things
to us.

37:10.146 --> 37:14.150
We have done things to us.

37:16.193 --> 37:17.945
So, what do you propose?

37:19.155 --> 37:21.532
I propose we have a drink.

37:30.166 --> 37:32.543
A King needs a Queen.

37:34.128 --> 37:36.213
The death of Argus
left an opening.

37:36.923 --> 37:38.507
Argus was a relic,

37:38.674 --> 37:41.260
a desiccating, necrotising,

37:41.427 --> 37:44.639
geriatric, organic sack
of redundancies.

37:48.225 --> 37:50.519
CCTV?

37:50.686 --> 37:52.480
Fuck that noise!

37:53.439 --> 37:56.442
I fart out a coltan-encased
microchip

37:56.609 --> 37:59.028
in cherry pink
and they line up for miles.

38:00.279 --> 38:02.114
Miles!

38:02.281 --> 38:06.118
To carry trackers,
give up their locations,

38:06.285 --> 38:07.662
bank numbers,

38:08.621 --> 38:10.623
fucking facial IDs!

38:11.332 --> 38:14.085
An endless catalogue
of every fuck,

38:14.251 --> 38:19.131
every bite,
every disgusting nose hair.

38:20.967 --> 38:24.679
Every dirty little secret.

38:25.221 --> 38:28.099
Every whisper they thought
no one could hear.

38:30.518 --> 38:32.228
But I digress.

38:32.937 --> 38:35.564
What I'm here to discuss...

38:36.357 --> 38:37.566
is this.

38:40.695 --> 38:45.491
Argus had a lotta fucking eyes.

38:46.242 --> 38:47.326
But...

38:51.330 --> 38:55.793
I have given of my flesh
to my disciples

38:58.087 --> 39:02.425
and they have returned
the favor one-thousand fold.

39:04.093 --> 39:05.177
And now?

39:11.767 --> 39:14.020
Eyes are...

39:20.526 --> 39:22.611
You get?

39:23.779 --> 39:25.281
You ken?

39:27.366 --> 39:29.243
You comprende?

39:36.751 --> 39:39.211
About time.

39:39.378 --> 39:42.923
- Now what are you doing?
- What we came to do.

39:46.385 --> 39:47.928
Candy?

39:48.095 --> 39:50.473
Oh, yes. I want a gold bar
and some nuggets.

39:50.639 --> 39:52.266
Credit or debit?

39:52.433 --> 39:54.477
- Oh, credit.
- Name?

39:54.643 --> 39:57.688
Odin. The Alfather. Never
failed to pay for my candy.

39:57.855 --> 39:59.273
Your name?

39:59.440 --> 40:01.233
Oh, he's just my assistant.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.526
Shadow Moon.

40:07.656 --> 40:11.035
There is no account
under the name Shadow Moon.

40:11.952 --> 40:14.371
That's not the name
on his birth certificate.

40:15.456 --> 40:17.833
There is no account
under the name Shadow Moon.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.461
No debit, no credit.

40:22.546 --> 40:24.757
Oh, so, no debit, no credit.
Not even a fucking car loan?

40:24.924 --> 40:26.926
What are you,
some off-the-grid freak?

40:27.093 --> 40:29.136
I never had any need for it.
Laura did it all.

40:29.303 --> 40:33.140
Do you know how much
Money hates that?

40:33.307 --> 40:35.101
- Access denied.
- No.

40:35.267 --> 40:37.436
This man is not relevant. He's
not looking for an audience.

40:37.603 --> 40:39.146
He's just the hired help.

40:39.313 --> 40:41.232
Access denied.

40:43.234 --> 40:45.236
I am the resurrection
and the life.

40:45.402 --> 40:47.404
Those who believe in me will
live, even though they die.

40:47.571 --> 40:49.490
I am the resurrection
and the life.

40:49.657 --> 40:51.575
Those who believe in me
will live, even though they die.

40:51.742 --> 40:53.661
What does He give you?

40:55.162 --> 40:56.372
Jesus?

40:59.583 --> 41:02.419
It's either I pray
or I run five miles.

41:03.712 --> 41:05.631
And I can't run no more,

41:05.798 --> 41:08.092
jacked up my leg
in Division One, so...

41:10.261 --> 41:12.680
I guess he gives me comfort.

41:12.847 --> 41:15.391
A God should provide
more than comfort.

41:19.103 --> 41:20.437
He does.

41:22.898 --> 41:24.567
Community.

41:25.860 --> 41:27.653
Feeling like there's a point.

41:29.113 --> 41:31.824
I mean, I'm still mad
about my leg,

41:33.200 --> 41:34.910
but if I hadn't messed it up,

41:35.995 --> 41:39.039
I would probably be in college,

41:40.916 --> 41:44.420
and instead I was here with
Gramma while she was sick, so...

41:46.630 --> 41:48.299
maybe it was meant to be.

41:51.135 --> 41:53.596
And maybe I don't gotta be mad
about it, you know?

41:54.555 --> 41:56.724
Gramma prayed for patience:

41:59.268 --> 42:01.145
"Lord, like Job,

42:01.312 --> 42:03.230
let me be patient."

42:04.607 --> 42:06.442
Job was wealthy.

42:06.609 --> 42:08.444
Did her Lord
give her wealth?

42:11.197 --> 42:13.365
This is Cairo!

42:13.532 --> 42:15.743
I don't think money's
got our address.

42:17.620 --> 42:20.789
Last week, I was
reading this blog,

42:21.332 --> 42:23.876
says how in America
the black woman makes

42:24.043 --> 42:26.045
60 cents for every dollar
a white man makes,

42:26.212 --> 42:29.548
and Gramma's all: "Well,
here in Cairo, honey,

42:29.715 --> 42:31.800
a black woman's lucky if she's
got 2 cents to rub together,

42:31.967 --> 42:34.011
and even if she's got
a pocket full of nickels,

42:34.178 --> 42:36.096
that don't mean that
that money's gonna make her

42:36.263 --> 42:38.349
suck a bedsheet up her ass
and fall asleep on a cloud."

42:43.479 --> 42:45.231
And then she laughed real hard.

42:47.942 --> 42:51.320
She was pretty sick,
but she laughed all the time.

42:53.239 --> 42:56.450
She never let anger or jealousy
guide her.

42:59.078 --> 43:01.038
Had her church,
had her community.

43:01.205 --> 43:05.501
She took care of me and Jamarr
when didn't nobody else want us.

43:06.627 --> 43:08.462
She was content.

43:09.713 --> 43:11.382
He was not content.

43:13.926 --> 43:17.429
He was a rebel, a troublemaker.

43:20.432 --> 43:23.143
They say he died for your sins,
but that is not the truth.

43:24.728 --> 43:27.314
He died because he angered
the men in power.

43:29.066 --> 43:31.360
He refused to be cowed...

43:33.028 --> 43:34.154
controlled.

43:36.407 --> 43:38.826
And now look
at the power he wields,

43:40.536 --> 43:43.372
the worship he commands.

43:46.458 --> 43:48.294
He was onto something.

43:52.631 --> 43:54.133
I'm Ruby.

43:55.843 --> 43:57.136
Ruby Goodchild.

44:00.431 --> 44:02.266
It's good
to meet you, Ruby.

44:06.312 --> 44:09.857
Shadow, will you just buy
some fucking candy? Huh?

44:10.733 --> 44:13.736
Do you see me trying?
I mean, look at this.

44:13.902 --> 44:15.821
Huh? They're not gonna sell me
any fucking candy!

44:15.988 --> 44:19.325
Mama-ji just might kill you.
She already wants to kill me.

44:19.867 --> 44:21.702
You know what? Fuck this.

44:22.453 --> 44:23.829
Why me?

44:23.996 --> 44:25.914
- Oh, not that again.
- Yeah, this again.

44:26.081 --> 44:28.083
- Will you just tell me?
- Whimsy.

44:28.250 --> 44:30.210
Why don't you just give me
a fucking answer?

44:30.377 --> 44:31.837
Come on.

44:32.004 --> 44:34.089
- You really want to know?
- Yeah.

44:34.256 --> 44:36.550
You really want to know
why I picked you?

44:36.717 --> 44:38.302
Just tell me.

44:38.469 --> 44:41.388
Well, I picked you
because I needed someone

44:41.555 --> 44:43.807
with nothing to live for,
with nothing to go home for,

44:43.974 --> 44:45.976
with no one to miss him
or love him

44:46.143 --> 44:48.103
or give a shit
if he lives or dies.

44:48.270 --> 44:50.314
That's why I picked you,
because you literally mean

44:50.481 --> 44:52.483
nothing to any living person.

44:52.649 --> 44:54.651
Or any dead one either,
as far as I know.

44:54.818 --> 44:58.697
You have no value, no worth
in this world or the next.

44:58.864 --> 45:00.491
Happy?

45:03.160 --> 45:04.370
Damn.

45:04.536 --> 45:06.163
Good.

45:09.750 --> 45:13.087
See, I've been here
trying to make it all add up.

45:13.253 --> 45:16.382
- Oh.
- Everything since we met.

45:16.548 --> 45:18.384
Oh, really?
How's that going for you?

45:18.550 --> 45:20.469
That little hamster
in the wheel in your brain

45:20.636 --> 45:22.429
make it out yet?

45:24.431 --> 45:25.682
Well, the...

45:27.226 --> 45:29.686
the only thing
that makes any sense,

45:29.853 --> 45:34.024
the only explanation that fits
all the facts, is that...

45:35.943 --> 45:37.486
..I do have value to you.

45:39.822 --> 45:41.824
See, I don't know why.

45:41.990 --> 45:44.660
You don't want me
to know why but...

45:46.829 --> 45:48.580
..you need me.

45:50.040 --> 45:51.166
Don't you?

45:55.504 --> 45:59.716
I am handing you the future
on a motherfucking platter.

46:01.176 --> 46:04.012
I'm gonna need you
to cut that edge pronto,

46:04.179 --> 46:06.432
and put some
fucking garnish on it.

46:07.850 --> 46:09.226
Show me.

46:17.484 --> 46:20.028
I never did see a God

46:20.195 --> 46:25.659
more effectively argue
his own obsolescence.

46:25.826 --> 46:28.537
What the fuck
are you doing here?

46:29.246 --> 46:30.956
Well, go on then.

46:33.083 --> 46:34.626
He's waiting.

46:36.587 --> 46:38.046
Show him.

46:46.138 --> 46:47.264
No?

46:51.518 --> 46:53.020
Then allow me.

47:13.207 --> 47:14.541
Hello, friend.

47:18.420 --> 47:20.005
Hello, friend.

47:25.844 --> 47:27.304
I was literally...

47:28.305 --> 47:30.599
your only friend.

47:34.144 --> 47:36.480
You lonely fuck.

47:43.111 --> 47:47.241
I brought you
into the presence of God.

47:53.121 --> 47:55.374
It looks like he's
forgotten about you.

48:11.848 --> 48:13.058
Mistake.

48:56.143 --> 48:57.185
Fuck!

49:23.003 --> 49:25.964
Wanna buy some candy? Candy?

49:26.131 --> 49:28.425
There isn't a need
to purchase candy.

49:31.511 --> 49:34.139
I retired a God today.

49:34.306 --> 49:36.642
Access granted.

49:42.939 --> 49:45.025
You killed Argus.

49:46.109 --> 49:48.737
And you killed Zorya.

49:50.072 --> 49:52.824
I am sorry about Zorya.

49:54.493 --> 49:56.119
But when you strike
with lightning,

49:56.286 --> 49:58.205
you should
expect consequences.

49:58.372 --> 49:59.915
Mess with my people,

50:00.082 --> 50:02.376
expect disproportionate
consequences.

50:02.542 --> 50:04.586
You got your man back.

50:04.753 --> 50:06.254
It's the principle.

50:06.922 --> 50:08.757
Hello?

50:08.924 --> 50:11.259
Hello?

50:11.426 --> 50:13.345
I'd like to pay.

50:13.887 --> 50:15.263
I'd like to pay.

50:16.264 --> 50:18.684
Have you seen what's
happened to the world?

50:20.268 --> 50:23.313
It isn't 5s, 10s, or 20s
anymore. It isn't cash or gold.

50:26.149 --> 50:30.862
It's zeros and ones,
digitized and encrypted,

50:31.697 --> 50:35.117
sent down fiber-optic cables
at the speed of light

50:36.118 --> 50:40.622
to accounts at banks
with no physical location.

50:43.291 --> 50:45.419
Money loves profit.

50:52.467 --> 50:55.178
And war is
always profitable.

50:55.929 --> 50:59.099
It also moves people more
than anything else.

50:59.266 --> 51:01.309
It inflames their passions,

51:01.476 --> 51:03.478
something you would know
nothing about.

51:03.645 --> 51:05.021
And the more passionate
they get,

51:05.188 --> 51:07.065
the more they spend,
spend, spend.

51:07.232 --> 51:08.942
You know that, Money.

51:09.901 --> 51:14.448
You sit at the crossing
of two rivers,

51:15.282 --> 51:19.369
waiting for a steamship
that will never come.

51:20.662 --> 51:23.457
Your kind aren't dying;
they're dead.

51:24.124 --> 51:28.128
Okay, enough -
I'm honored to have

51:28.295 --> 51:31.089
the big dogs in the God game
begging at my table.

51:31.256 --> 51:33.925
But money doesn't make
emotional investments

51:34.092 --> 51:35.802
or invest in emotional entities.

51:35.969 --> 51:38.513
Too much risk
in such ventures.

51:39.264 --> 51:41.475
Not enough opportunity.

51:42.017 --> 51:43.977
You could always
hedge your bets.

51:44.978 --> 51:47.063
There's no deal here for you
today, gentlemen.

51:47.230 --> 51:49.608
Money stays in the bank.

51:49.775 --> 51:51.109
This is agreeable.

51:51.818 --> 51:54.112
What a sad waste of capital.

52:02.370 --> 52:03.997
I'm gonna win this one.

52:04.164 --> 52:06.166
People like me more
than they like you.

52:06.333 --> 52:08.251
I prefer to be feared.

52:15.300 --> 52:17.302
I'm not your enemy.
