00:02.015 --> 00:03.403
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:03.433 --> 00:05.755
Freya: If this prophecy is fulfilled,

00:05.785 --> 00:07.023
you will all fall...

00:07.053 --> 00:09.253
One by friend, one by foe,

00:09.254 --> 00:11.559
and one by family.

00:11.589 --> 00:14.591
I suspect Niklaus is with your sister.

00:14.592 --> 00:16.564
Wherever you go, Aurora follows.

00:16.594 --> 00:17.983
I knew you would find me.

00:18.013 --> 00:19.301
Hello, my sweet love.

00:19.331 --> 00:22.266
I'm here for the same reason
Lucien and Tristan are,

00:22.267 --> 00:23.650
to protect my sire.

00:23.680 --> 00:24.803
I need to know...

00:24.804 --> 00:26.107
Where in the hell is Rebekah?

00:26.137 --> 00:28.205
Rebekah: I will use the
advantages this body has

00:28.206 --> 00:30.108
while I search for a way to bring back Kol,

00:30.109 --> 00:31.176
and then who knows?

00:31.177 --> 00:32.511
Marcel: My guys stayed on Tristan's trail,

00:32.512 --> 00:34.145
followed him to a secret storehouse,

00:34.146 --> 00:36.380
and you'll never guess who just bought

00:36.381 --> 00:37.516
that storehouse.

00:37.517 --> 00:38.416
One Lucien Castle.

00:38.417 --> 00:40.118
They've been working
together the whole time.

00:40.119 --> 00:42.087
In the wrong hands, this stuff
could destroy the city.

00:42.088 --> 00:43.722
Property of Nola PD.
Evidence in a murder case.

00:43.723 --> 00:45.423
From the forensics from
tonight's crime scene,

00:45.424 --> 00:46.946
only prints on the victim are yours.

00:46.976 --> 00:48.743
Cami O'Connell, you're under arrest.

00:48.744 --> 00:50.744
Aurora: In the moments before you asked me

00:50.745 --> 00:52.417
to flee with you, I saw your brother.

00:52.447 --> 00:53.602
He's lied to us all.

00:53.632 --> 00:54.987
And yet I love him.

00:55.017 --> 00:57.604
You must only see him
as the wretched monster

00:57.634 --> 00:58.624
that he truly is.

00:58.654 --> 01:00.993
What you did to Aurora, to me.

01:01.023 --> 01:02.762
You set my course!

01:02.792 --> 01:05.860
You want a fight, so be it.

01:31.986 --> 01:33.694
What are you doing over there?

01:33.724 --> 01:35.392
Come closer.

01:36.457 --> 01:38.358
I think it's best you remain

01:38.359 --> 01:40.762
out of arm's reach.

01:41.279 --> 01:42.938
(Sighs)

01:43.239 --> 01:44.953
So I take it you've heard
about the busy day

01:44.983 --> 01:47.017
everyone's had.

01:47.018 --> 01:50.654
Let me take away that scowl.

01:51.153 --> 01:53.057
I'll tell you everything I know.

01:53.831 --> 01:56.755
(Church bells ringing)

01:56.993 --> 01:59.546
_

02:20.768 --> 02:22.391
I told you this was better than exchanging

02:22.421 --> 02:23.542
stuffy, old letters.

02:23.572 --> 02:25.272
Well, a drink with my sister beats

02:25.302 --> 02:27.174
sire line drama any day.

02:27.175 --> 02:29.147
Lucien's always been a pain in the ass,

02:29.177 --> 02:32.712
though he pails compared to
that stuck-up twit Tristan.

02:32.713 --> 02:35.015
Oh, and don't forget about The Strix.

02:35.016 --> 02:37.717
There's more of them in
the quarter every day.

02:37.718 --> 02:40.220
I may yet join you here in the flesh.

02:40.221 --> 02:41.976
Well, I would love the company,

02:42.006 --> 02:43.975
but I might not be here much longer.

02:43.976 --> 02:45.376
I have a meeting with a Santeria witch

02:45.377 --> 02:48.416
who may know the key to bringing back Kol.

02:48.446 --> 02:51.648
We may unite the family after all.

02:51.649 --> 02:53.484
Now tell me, how are you
managing with them?

02:53.485 --> 02:57.421
Oh, Niklaus and Elijah are on
intermittent speaking terms,

02:57.422 --> 03:01.692
which I've decided to consider progress.

03:01.693 --> 03:05.363
Just wait, luv. The weather will change.

03:06.464 --> 03:09.432
Now I am off to a witch rendez-vous.

03:09.462 --> 03:11.161
Stay safe.

03:12.437 --> 03:14.405
Here's to family,

03:14.406 --> 03:17.075
every bloody one of us.

03:31.523 --> 03:33.924
A warning, sir.
If you're looking for trouble,

03:33.925 --> 03:36.495
you might want to think twice.

03:40.532 --> 03:44.169
That's the problem with a witch's body.

03:45.270 --> 03:46.804
You can't put up much of a fight

03:46.805 --> 03:49.808
when the real monsters come out.

03:58.850 --> 04:01.152
(Footsteps)

04:34.219 --> 04:36.087
Aagh!

04:43.194 --> 04:44.896
(Thump)

04:59.110 --> 05:01.545
May I ask what happened?

05:01.546 --> 05:05.250
We had a little chat about the past.

05:05.984 --> 05:09.219
I politely informed Niklaus
that I'm not his enemy,

05:09.220 --> 05:10.821
and though they entered the city

05:10.822 --> 05:13.023
under the guise of peace,

05:13.024 --> 05:15.259
Tristan and Lucien in truth

05:15.260 --> 05:16.760
are allied against us,

05:16.761 --> 05:18.096
a fact that required a little bit

05:18.097 --> 05:21.098
of gentle persuasion.

05:21.099 --> 05:23.200
And so I reminded our brother

05:23.201 --> 05:25.402
who angered them in the first place.

05:25.403 --> 05:29.273
And after all of this civil discourse,

05:29.274 --> 05:32.076
what understanding did you come to?

05:32.077 --> 05:36.480
That we expose and destroy our first sired.

05:36.481 --> 05:37.782
Couldn't agree with you more.

05:37.783 --> 05:40.688
You see, gentlemen know when it's time

05:40.718 --> 05:42.919
to call a truce and turn our fury

05:42.920 --> 05:45.723
in a more pertinent direction.

05:48.926 --> 05:52.667
Will: Come on. For someone
always giving me an earful,

05:52.697 --> 05:53.965
that was a very quite ride.

05:53.966 --> 05:55.100
What do you want me to say, detective?

05:55.130 --> 05:56.655
Well done! The streets of
New Orleans are safe.

05:56.685 --> 05:58.025
What I'd love to hear is a confession.

05:58.055 --> 05:59.088
It would make my job easier.

05:59.089 --> 06:00.794
I am not a serial killer, and while you're

06:00.824 --> 06:02.825
wasting time with me, the real
murderer is still out there.

06:02.826 --> 06:04.926
Well, if I'm missing something, show me.

06:04.927 --> 06:06.761
Prove to me you're the victim,

06:06.762 --> 06:08.931
and I will protect you.

06:15.804 --> 06:17.772
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

06:17.773 --> 06:19.978
A cold-blooded killer?

06:20.008 --> 06:23.265
Camille, what a shocking turn of the cards!

06:23.295 --> 06:24.395
(Gasps)

06:24.396 --> 06:25.263
Ahh. You should rest.

06:25.264 --> 06:28.609
We've got a big day ahead of us.

06:28.639 --> 06:30.768
There we are.

06:38.176 --> 06:40.210
Hey, Davina. It's me.

06:40.211 --> 06:42.212
I, um... I'm running a little late.

06:42.213 --> 06:44.316
I should be there soon.

06:50.322 --> 06:54.125
On second thought, I'll be a little longer.

07:18.683 --> 07:21.286
(Clattering)

07:35.926 --> 07:38.335
You're not very good at tailing, are you?

07:38.336 --> 07:41.172
My talents lie elsewhere.

07:43.126 --> 07:44.296
Ah!

07:44.476 --> 07:45.598
- Unh!
- Aah!

07:45.628 --> 07:47.462
(Groans)

07:47.463 --> 07:48.696
(Chokes)

07:48.697 --> 07:50.164
(Growls)

07:50.165 --> 07:51.901
Agh!

07:59.008 --> 08:01.075
Ah, yes.

08:01.076 --> 08:03.378
Drinking with Rebekah.

08:03.379 --> 08:05.481
Always an adventure.

08:07.917 --> 08:09.350
(Grunts)

08:09.351 --> 08:11.653
You seem more annoyed than usual.

08:11.654 --> 08:14.389
It's Aurora.

08:14.990 --> 08:16.590
Her influence frightens me,

08:16.591 --> 08:18.592
and yet our hideously deluded brother

08:18.593 --> 08:19.928
seems to believe that she might be the key

08:19.929 --> 08:21.929
to ending this wretched prophecy.

08:21.930 --> 08:24.632
If she's aligned with her brother,

08:24.633 --> 08:25.600
what chance does Nik have?

08:25.601 --> 08:28.669
None. Still, Niklaus believes
that she can be swayed,

08:28.670 --> 08:31.805
although his perspective of family loyalty

08:31.806 --> 08:33.078
is schizophrenic at best.

08:33.109 --> 08:35.476
Well, I don't get why Lucien and Tristan

08:35.477 --> 08:36.711
are working together.

08:36.712 --> 08:38.979
Aren't their sire lines direct enemies?

08:38.980 --> 08:40.714
Well, a mutual lack of goodwill

08:40.715 --> 08:44.715
toward our family might not
be entirely unjustified.

08:46.988 --> 08:49.189
Hatred's a hell of a thing, Freya.

08:49.190 --> 08:52.392
Why? All you did was sire them.

08:52.393 --> 08:55.463
They don't seem to be complaining.

08:57.482 --> 08:59.750
Elijah...

08:59.751 --> 09:02.788
What exactly did you do?

09:05.524 --> 09:08.397
I compelled Lucien to believe
that he was Niklaus,

09:08.427 --> 09:10.427
Aurora to believe that she was Rebekah,

09:10.428 --> 09:11.596
and Tristan myself...

09:11.597 --> 09:15.332
After I'd sired him of course.

09:15.333 --> 09:18.201
This had been a period of mayhem for us.

09:18.202 --> 09:19.337
It was the 11th century,

09:19.338 --> 09:21.471
father was hunting us mercilessly,

09:21.472 --> 09:22.707
so I compelled them,

09:22.708 --> 09:24.394
and then I told them to run.

09:24.424 --> 09:25.687
You made them bait.

09:25.717 --> 09:26.980
Not the kindest thing I ever did,

09:27.010 --> 09:29.547
if I'm perfectly Frank with you, Freya.

09:30.248 --> 09:35.365
So while we found respite in the sleepy,
yet charming vineyards of Tuscany,

09:35.531 --> 09:37.820
father hunted the decoy Mikaelson children

09:37.821 --> 09:40.203
to the far reaches of Europe for
the better part of a century.

09:40.291 --> 09:44.291
Then we were inconveniently daggered.

09:45.063 --> 09:47.469
The compulsion was broken, here we are.

09:47.499 --> 09:49.433
How's the head?

09:49.434 --> 09:53.057
Spinning. I don't think it's the hangover.

09:53.087 --> 09:56.456
Freya, something you must
understand about this family.

09:56.457 --> 09:57.962
Under threat, we take action,

09:57.992 --> 09:59.365
for better or worse,

09:59.395 --> 10:01.995
whatever it takes to protect our own.

10:01.996 --> 10:04.164
So you're telling me
their days are numbered.

10:04.165 --> 10:06.605
If indeed they're working against us, yes,

10:06.635 --> 10:08.737
without question.

10:10.071 --> 10:12.139
Perhaps a little hair of the dog

10:12.140 --> 10:16.077
might be more effective, wouldn't you say?

10:19.250 --> 10:20.749
What is it?

10:23.352 --> 10:25.487
Something's wrong.

10:26.688 --> 10:29.624
We need to call Rebekah now.

10:30.871 --> 10:34.466
(Jazz playing)

10:34.546 --> 10:36.816
What a lovely necklace.

10:37.041 --> 10:42.694
That emerald would really flatter
my eyes, don't you think?

10:43.955 --> 10:46.723
I think my necklace would
flatter your eyes.

10:46.724 --> 10:49.030
Thank you. You shouldn't have.

10:49.060 --> 10:50.599
Will you be taking candy

10:50.629 --> 10:53.431
from a toddler next?

10:53.932 --> 10:55.282
If I should happen to be in the mood

10:55.312 --> 10:58.069
for something sweet.

10:58.570 --> 11:00.304
Come with me.

11:00.305 --> 11:01.506
And don't worry.

11:01.748 --> 11:04.609
I promise I won't bite.

11:07.952 --> 11:10.247
Aurora: So am I to receive
a stern talking to

11:10.248 --> 11:11.882
for my poor behavior?

11:11.883 --> 11:12.851
On the contrary.

11:12.852 --> 11:15.186
I've cleared my calendar for the day.

11:15.187 --> 11:17.688
I want to show you my city.

11:18.554 --> 11:20.796
Is this your attempt to
discern whose side I'm on.

11:20.826 --> 11:23.727
I'd love to know whose side you're on,

11:23.728 --> 11:24.829
but it would be rude of me to ask

11:24.830 --> 11:27.564
such blunt discourse from
so beautiful a woman

11:27.565 --> 11:29.304
without first buying her lunch.

11:29.334 --> 11:31.034
Wouldn't you agree?

11:31.545 --> 11:35.009
Well, it does seem like most men
have lost their manners these days.

11:35.039 --> 11:37.341
That shall be lovely.

11:37.342 --> 11:38.727
Heh.

11:42.347 --> 11:44.349
(Moans)

12:01.933 --> 12:04.039
Lucien: I took the liberty
of removing your handcuffs...

12:04.626 --> 12:08.690
Unless you're the type that
likes to be restrained.

12:08.720 --> 12:09.873
Please take it.

12:09.874 --> 12:13.277
Consider it an apology for
the rough start to our day.

12:13.278 --> 12:15.517
I see no reason we cannot begin anew.

12:15.547 --> 12:17.481
I only drink with friends,

12:17.482 --> 12:19.950
and, unless this isn't abundantly clear,

12:19.951 --> 12:22.290
I don't like you.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.156
Fair enough.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.158
Later on, I Hope you'll remember

12:28.159 --> 12:32.329
this all could have gone so much easier.

12:32.330 --> 12:34.198
Detective Kinney, come on in

12:34.199 --> 12:36.939
and start cutting up the mirepoix.

12:36.969 --> 12:38.070
You compelled him?

12:38.371 --> 12:40.104
What the hell is going on?

12:40.505 --> 12:41.844
Why don't you focus on the cutting?

12:41.874 --> 12:43.942
We don't want you to lose
any fingers while we talk.

12:44.562 --> 12:46.381
Did you know that Will's mother's side

12:46.411 --> 12:47.593
is full of chefs?

12:47.623 --> 12:49.085
He's going to make us his grandmother's

12:49.115 --> 12:50.581
Grillades and Grits

12:50.976 --> 12:53.005
I took the liberty of
texting your nosey friend

12:53.035 --> 12:55.102
Vincent on your behalf.

12:55.103 --> 12:57.371
After leaving police care without incident,

12:57.372 --> 12:58.773
he believes you have a date

12:58.774 --> 13:00.946
with "the real housewives"
at home in your pjs.

13:00.976 --> 13:03.515
What the hell kind of point
are you trying to make?

13:03.545 --> 13:05.950
Detective, do me a favor.

13:05.980 --> 13:08.282
Throw your blade at her pretty face.

13:08.730 --> 13:10.588
Ohh!

13:10.618 --> 13:13.287
Now that I have your attention,

13:13.288 --> 13:14.793
my point is simple.

13:14.823 --> 13:16.791
I'm looking for a particular dark object,

13:17.386 --> 13:20.698
a small bronze medallion
with runic markings.

13:20.728 --> 13:23.906
Since you're on vervain,
I'm going to ask nicely

13:23.936 --> 13:24.909
that you help me find it.

13:24.939 --> 13:26.534
Should you refuse,

13:26.535 --> 13:30.534
the parlor tricks will get
increasingly less fun.

13:31.773 --> 13:33.508
Carry on.

13:35.394 --> 13:37.329
There's a girl.

13:41.366 --> 13:43.868
She's still not answering.

13:45.570 --> 13:46.937
<i>Touve mon se kavo.</i>

13:46.938 --> 13:49.541
<i>Touve mon se kavo.</i>

13:53.449 --> 13:55.879
There's nothing to connect to.

13:55.909 --> 13:57.349
She's gone.

13:57.350 --> 13:58.949
What do you mean she's gone?

13:58.950 --> 14:00.919
I can't find her, which
means her witch body,

14:00.920 --> 14:04.856
her connection to magic,
it's as if it just vanished.

14:06.891 --> 14:08.760
(Gasps)

14:14.282 --> 14:16.151
Bloody hell.

14:24.442 --> 14:25.976
Not only did you slit my throat,

14:25.977 --> 14:27.945
you stole my bloody phone.

14:27.946 --> 14:29.851
(Footsteps)

14:29.881 --> 14:31.220
Hello, Rebekah.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.722
Aya, of course.

14:33.752 --> 14:35.653
Elijah's little protege.

14:35.654 --> 14:36.788
Let me guess. You were tasked

14:36.789 --> 14:38.493
with finding my Original body,

14:38.523 --> 14:39.824
you couldn't do your job,

14:39.825 --> 14:42.326
so you did this to my
other one to lure me out.

14:42.327 --> 14:45.763
Clever but ill-advised.

14:45.764 --> 14:47.636
You see, I needed that body,

14:47.666 --> 14:50.434
and now you owe me a hell of
a lot more than an apology.

14:50.435 --> 14:52.177
I don't owe you anything.

14:52.207 --> 14:55.076
I'm here to claim the unattended Mikaelson.

14:55.106 --> 14:58.443
I only had chains enough for one of you.

15:01.147 --> 15:02.658
Heh.

15:03.177 --> 15:04.682
Is that all you brought?

15:04.978 --> 15:08.656
I met your special friend... Marcel Gerard.

15:08.686 --> 15:10.521
It's been amusing getting to know him.

15:11.024 --> 15:13.778
Maybe I'll send him one of
your heads as a souvenir.

15:13.808 --> 15:16.299
Enough with the idle chit-chat.

15:17.245 --> 15:19.947
Are you gonna throw the
first punch or what?

15:19.948 --> 15:22.717
Respect my elders.

15:23.285 --> 15:25.053
You first.

15:31.084 --> 15:33.531
Mmm. I find the cajun cuisine

15:33.561 --> 15:36.368
almost as delicious as their people.

15:36.398 --> 15:37.735
Well done, William.

15:37.765 --> 15:39.038
Not like I had a choice.

15:39.068 --> 15:39.789
Hmm.

15:39.819 --> 15:41.591
The moment I do, I'm gonna use this knife,

15:41.621 --> 15:42.663
I'm gonna stab you in the heart.

15:42.693 --> 15:43.743
You couldn't if you tried.

15:43.773 --> 15:44.940
You've been compelled

15:44.941 --> 15:47.175
to do everything he says.

15:47.428 --> 15:48.727
It's like hypnosis.

15:48.757 --> 15:52.329
Vampires use it against
humans to do their bidding.

15:52.724 --> 15:55.103
We're using the "v" word now?

15:55.330 --> 15:58.130
Great. Might as well embrace the insanity.

15:59.099 --> 16:00.572
What else you gonna force us to do?

16:00.573 --> 16:02.678
Well, Camille here consumes vervain,

16:02.708 --> 16:04.908
so I can't force her to do anything,

16:04.909 --> 16:08.015
but in exchange for
preventing future bloodshed,

16:08.045 --> 16:11.369
I'd ask that you find me that
pretty, little medallion.

16:11.399 --> 16:14.000
Like I've told you, I have
cataloged everything.

16:14.001 --> 16:17.138
What you're looking for is not here.

16:18.624 --> 16:21.141
It's there. Just hidden,

16:21.171 --> 16:22.415
built into something else.

16:22.445 --> 16:24.211
- Find it!
- And then what?

16:24.212 --> 16:28.212
Some shiny ornament helps you
get your revenge on Klaus?

16:28.450 --> 16:32.720
Don't tell me this is all
because he stole your girl.

16:32.721 --> 16:36.623
He did a lot more than
steal my girl, Camille.

16:36.624 --> 16:40.208
He stole 100 years of my life.

16:40.238 --> 16:41.670
Now that gives me a thought.

16:41.700 --> 16:44.631
Loss is a great motivator.

16:44.832 --> 16:48.435
Slice open your arcuate artery.

16:48.436 --> 16:50.003
No!

16:50.004 --> 16:51.572
Ugh!

16:54.525 --> 16:56.572
Ooh.

16:56.602 --> 16:58.512
That's a nasty wound.

16:58.513 --> 17:01.649
He'll bleed out if that's not treated.

17:03.572 --> 17:05.900
Tick-tock, Camille.

17:16.164 --> 17:18.065
Mmm.

17:18.066 --> 17:20.099
That was delicious.

17:20.101 --> 17:21.501
I aim to please.

17:21.502 --> 17:23.569
No. Darling, you aim

17:23.570 --> 17:26.173
to suck me dry of information,

17:26.174 --> 17:29.710
but you fed me well, so I
suppose I owe you a favor.

17:29.711 --> 17:31.678
What would you like to know?

17:31.679 --> 17:34.581
Well, it's quite simple really.

17:34.582 --> 17:37.718
I find being in your company again

17:37.719 --> 17:41.421
wonderfully intoxicating.

17:41.422 --> 17:44.191
So my question is

17:44.192 --> 17:46.861
do you feel the same?

17:48.359 --> 17:51.336
Nik, I am not your enemy, nor Rebekah's.

17:51.416 --> 17:54.752
After all, she's my sire,

17:54.753 --> 17:57.187
but I do hate Elijah,

17:57.188 --> 17:59.523
given what he's done to me and to you.

17:59.524 --> 18:01.459
So you choose to ally with the brother

18:01.460 --> 18:02.827
who locked you in a prison

18:02.828 --> 18:04.328
and the stable boy who, until now,

18:04.329 --> 18:07.432
was always so far beneath you?

18:12.092 --> 18:14.204
You know, the 3 of us spent

18:14.205 --> 18:17.775
100 years working together

18:17.776 --> 18:19.677
and running together,

18:20.053 --> 18:22.713
believing we were the Mikaelsons,

18:22.714 --> 18:24.314
and you knew your father.

18:24.315 --> 18:27.418
It was no easy task to avoid him,

18:27.419 --> 18:29.286
and yet we survived,

18:29.287 --> 18:30.555
and when the compulsion ended,

18:30.556 --> 18:34.726
it was as if someone had
peeled off our skin.

18:35.660 --> 18:38.429
We lost everything of who we were

18:38.430 --> 18:42.166
and what we'd become in a single moment,

18:42.167 --> 18:43.268
and even though we now knew

18:43.269 --> 18:45.070
we were little more than
an elaborate red herring,

18:45.071 --> 18:48.205
Mikael was still after us,

18:48.206 --> 18:50.307
so Tristan swore he wouldn't rest

18:50.308 --> 18:51.842
until we made you pay.

18:51.843 --> 18:55.345
So the 3 of us swore a pact of vengeance.

18:55.346 --> 18:56.548
For centuries, we scoured the world

18:56.549 --> 19:00.384
looking for weapons that
would kill the lot of you,

19:00.385 --> 19:02.453
but Lucien and Tristan never quite got over

19:02.454 --> 19:04.388
their hatred of one another.

19:04.389 --> 19:07.425
Seems a little short-sighted.

19:08.660 --> 19:12.660
If my family dies, so do all of you.

19:14.278 --> 19:17.669
Well, that's the beautiful
mystery, isn't it?

19:20.739 --> 19:25.075
I... I think I'd like dessert.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.411
Perhaps you can take me for a walk,

19:26.412 --> 19:30.414
show me what it is you like about
this strange, little city.

19:30.415 --> 19:34.415
Hayley: You might remember him from
that pretentious excuse for a party.

19:37.522 --> 19:39.659
Shen Min.

19:39.689 --> 19:41.096
800 years old.

19:41.126 --> 19:44.461
According to Tristan, he was a
torture consultant for genghis Khan.

19:44.462 --> 19:45.797
I don't care if he's a gemini

19:45.798 --> 19:47.599
who likes long walks on the beach, Marcel.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.401
Why was he following me?

19:51.934 --> 19:52.792
I don't know.

19:52.822 --> 19:54.388
You don't know, or you're sworn

19:54.389 --> 19:55.460
to the code of silence.

19:55.527 --> 19:59.931
Hey. Easy. We're on the same side here.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.934
Then prove it.

20:10.024 --> 20:12.059
Mikaelson blood tracks Mikaelson blood.

20:12.089 --> 20:14.046
I should be able to find her.

20:15.814 --> 20:17.548
I don't understand.

20:17.899 --> 20:19.433
Why bring Rebekah into this?

20:19.434 --> 20:21.435
They want all 3 sires.

20:21.436 --> 20:23.437
Tristan and Lucien kept us occupied here

20:23.438 --> 20:24.810
while they hunted Rebekah.

20:24.840 --> 20:26.641
She's strong.

20:26.642 --> 20:27.776
She cannot be killed.

20:27.777 --> 20:30.679
The prophecy says otherwise.

20:35.584 --> 20:37.752
Sang bis najitt trouver.

20:37.753 --> 20:39.453
Sang bis najitt trouver.

20:39.454 --> 20:41.656
Sang bis najitt trouver.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.691
Sang bis najitt trouver.

20:43.692 --> 20:45.127
Unh!

21:09.200 --> 21:12.036
You're a bit out of sorts.

21:12.037 --> 21:14.171
Been in a coffin for 6 months.

21:14.172 --> 21:16.106
I'm just getting warmed up.

21:16.107 --> 21:18.175
Besides, I think I'm in the lead,

21:18.176 --> 21:21.379
not that anyone's keeping score.

21:26.551 --> 21:29.854
I guess I should be flattered.

21:31.356 --> 21:35.126
I can't leave you alone for 5 minutes.

21:38.897 --> 21:40.998
Menedek qual suurentaa.

21:40.999 --> 21:43.802
(Necks snapping)

21:46.404 --> 21:48.844
Not bad.

21:48.874 --> 21:50.074
Now what?

21:50.075 --> 21:51.777
Run.

21:57.950 --> 22:02.020
Hasn't yet. The hunt continues.

22:05.724 --> 22:07.625
How you holding up?

22:08.326 --> 22:11.461
Well, I'm gushing blood into a bucket

22:11.462 --> 22:13.231
because the vampire who kidnapped us

22:13.232 --> 22:14.889
doesn't want to stain his floor,

22:14.919 --> 22:19.603
so pretty great.

22:19.604 --> 22:21.305
I got you into this mess.

22:21.306 --> 22:22.607
The least I can do is stop the bleeding.

22:22.608 --> 22:23.808
No. Don't beat yourself up.

22:23.809 --> 22:26.019
I'm tenacious.
Would have gotten into this mess

22:26.049 --> 22:27.416
with or without you.

22:27.446 --> 22:30.114
(Gasps)

22:30.682 --> 22:34.352
I have a feeling you
shouldn't come any closer.

22:37.288 --> 22:40.558
More tricks from Mr. Transylvania.

22:45.730 --> 22:48.699
This is what happened to
your brother, isn't it?

22:48.700 --> 22:51.234
Your family got mixed up
in the supernatural world.

22:51.235 --> 22:55.372
Someone made him do something
he never would have done.

22:55.373 --> 22:58.242
No one should have to go through that.

23:05.517 --> 23:08.486
Listen. I... I have a sister.

23:08.487 --> 23:10.901
- If I don't make it...
- No.

23:11.656 --> 23:12.724
We're walking out of this.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.159
At this point, limping out of this

23:14.160 --> 23:16.527
is gonna be a challenge.

23:16.528 --> 23:18.129
I still have leverage.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.498
I'm the only one who can
find what Lucien needs,

23:20.499 --> 23:23.101
so let's find it.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.081
Why would you bring me here?

23:31.111 --> 23:32.577
It's so morbid.

23:32.578 --> 23:35.000
They call these graveyards
The Cities of the Dead,

23:35.030 --> 23:38.482
elevated mausoleums meant to
honor those who've passed on.

23:38.483 --> 23:40.985
It's a very human attempt to overcome fear

23:40.986 --> 23:43.025
of mortality by celebrating death.

23:43.055 --> 23:45.523
Morbid, certainly, but pure.

23:45.524 --> 23:47.929
Oh. Pure. Like your intentions.

23:47.959 --> 23:50.995
My intentions are quite the opposite.

23:50.996 --> 23:53.165
How about yours?

23:54.607 --> 23:57.339
Hmm.

23:57.369 --> 23:59.537
You know...

23:59.538 --> 24:02.039
Over the long centuries,

24:02.040 --> 24:05.276
I would dream of you,

24:05.277 --> 24:08.379
my bright light in an ocean of darkness,

24:08.380 --> 24:10.282
a kindred whose despair mirrored my own

24:10.283 --> 24:13.818
and whose love brought
me a joy I had not felt

24:13.819 --> 24:16.788
and have never felt since.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.825
But if only it were real,

24:20.826 --> 24:24.826
this charming stroll through
your melancholy preoccupations,

24:25.464 --> 24:27.732
but I know it's really an interrogation

24:27.733 --> 24:30.401
under the guise of pleasantries.

24:30.402 --> 24:33.141
My desire for answers is only fair.

24:33.171 --> 24:35.005
We are on the brink of war,

24:35.006 --> 24:36.674
but if you doubt the veracity

24:36.675 --> 24:39.310
of my feelings for you...

24:42.213 --> 24:46.451
Then our tour has one final stop.

24:49.454 --> 24:50.722
She can't stay there.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.363
Rebekah cannot fight them alone.

24:52.393 --> 24:55.025
I tried. She's of no mood to listen.

24:55.055 --> 24:56.594
Perhaps you'll have better luck.

24:56.595 --> 24:58.996
(Cell phone vibrating)

24:58.997 --> 25:00.398
It's Marcel.

25:00.399 --> 25:02.367
Your timing's perfectly horrendous.

25:02.368 --> 25:04.902
Yeah? Well, I need your help.

25:04.903 --> 25:07.438
Hayley caught one of
Tristan's guys tailing her,

25:07.439 --> 25:10.341
knocked him out, brought him to the gym

25:10.342 --> 25:11.876
for a little Q&A.

25:11.877 --> 25:13.277
Problem is,

25:13.897 --> 25:15.680
it's Shen Min.

25:16.281 --> 25:17.981
Marcellus, do I need to remind you

25:17.982 --> 25:21.618
that Shen Min was know as the Red
Sorrow before he was a vampire?

25:21.619 --> 25:23.358
You execute him immediately.

25:23.388 --> 25:24.822
Elijah.

25:24.823 --> 25:27.559
(Humming)

25:31.430 --> 25:34.533
So what, you gonna sleep all day?

25:36.049 --> 25:39.905
Elijah: Before he wakes, tear
that heart from his chest.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.344
Sang bis najitt trouver.

25:46.345 --> 25:49.381
Sang bis najitt trouver.

25:53.352 --> 25:56.787
It's good to see you, Elijah,

25:57.400 --> 25:59.857
even if you're not flesh and blood.

26:00.303 --> 26:01.759
It's time to come home, Rebekah.

26:02.460 --> 26:04.694
No. I'm too close to bringing Kol back.

26:04.695 --> 26:06.737
You're even closer to bringing
about your own destruction.

26:06.767 --> 26:08.004
I'm not leaving without that spell.

26:08.034 --> 26:10.367
Kol will have to wait, sister.

26:10.368 --> 26:12.036
The Strix are making their move.

26:12.037 --> 26:12.871
What happened?

26:12.872 --> 26:15.005
Hayley had an encounter

26:15.006 --> 26:15.740
with Shen Min.

26:15.741 --> 26:18.076
She and Marcel are dealing
with this matter accordingly.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.777
What the hell are you doing here?

26:19.778 --> 26:22.128
Go and save them before
that lunatic gets free!

26:22.158 --> 26:26.051
Give me your word.
Come home now. No detours.

26:30.857 --> 26:34.195
Fine, but my niece's mum
and that handsome fool

26:34.225 --> 26:36.260
better be alive when I get back.

26:36.261 --> 26:39.100
You make certain she returns.

26:39.130 --> 26:41.566
I'll see you tonight.

26:51.110 --> 26:54.745
Hmm. About time.

26:55.109 --> 26:57.382
Now we can get started.

27:00.085 --> 27:04.323
Yes, we certainly can.

27:11.270 --> 27:12.556
There's still time.

27:12.856 --> 27:16.358
If you talk, maybe I'll
even get you healed.

27:16.359 --> 27:18.193
Why were you following me?

27:18.194 --> 27:21.463
Because we have a use for you,

27:21.464 --> 27:23.526
or is it some other reason?

27:23.556 --> 27:24.734
You'll never know, and it won't matter

27:24.735 --> 27:27.056
because when I get free,

27:27.086 --> 27:29.754
I'm going to break your jaw as you did mine

27:29.755 --> 27:33.491
and slowly pull your
intestines out from your body.

27:33.492 --> 27:36.561
Hey. How about we just calm down?

27:36.562 --> 27:39.163
And you. The others were so pleased

27:39.164 --> 27:40.232
when you joined our ranks,

27:40.233 --> 27:42.500
but I knew from the start you were filth.

27:42.501 --> 27:45.069
You've proven it by siding against us.

27:45.070 --> 27:47.972
For that, I will end you,

27:47.973 --> 27:52.810
but not before you watch
her die, screaming.

27:52.811 --> 27:56.581
Right. Well, ok.
That's about enough of that.

27:56.582 --> 27:59.083
Sorry, Hayley. Your turn's over.

27:59.084 --> 28:01.487
He's got to die.

28:18.704 --> 28:20.905
Unh! Take him.

28:20.906 --> 28:22.708
Unh!

28:24.576 --> 28:26.944
Agh!

28:26.945 --> 28:28.547
Agh!

28:29.602 --> 28:31.317
How poetic.

28:31.318 --> 28:34.619
Two warriors fighting side by side

28:34.620 --> 28:36.654
dying together.

28:36.655 --> 28:38.491
Unh!

28:44.430 --> 28:46.836
(Gasping)

28:46.866 --> 28:48.333
Are you ok?

28:48.334 --> 28:50.478
Oh, I'm fine. Thank you for asking.

28:50.508 --> 28:53.639
Marcellus, next time I ask
you to take out the trash...

28:55.608 --> 28:57.977
Try not to dally.

29:00.947 --> 29:03.315
Rebekah, we have to go.

29:03.316 --> 29:06.185
I'll get you on the first flight out.

29:07.220 --> 29:08.321
I can't give up now,

29:08.322 --> 29:10.809
not when the answers to
bringing out brother back

29:10.839 --> 29:12.190
are just a few streets away.

29:12.191 --> 29:13.159
You promised Elijah.

29:13.160 --> 29:15.894
And what about my promise to Kol?

29:15.895 --> 29:17.130
I've already lost my witch body.

29:17.131 --> 29:19.532
I can't go home with nothing.

29:22.167 --> 29:24.035
Well, I suppose arguing with you

29:24.036 --> 29:26.938
would be a waste of already precious time.

29:26.939 --> 29:31.844
See? You're fitting into
this family like a glove.

29:38.117 --> 29:40.017
So is this your family home?

29:40.018 --> 29:41.953
Please forgive the detritus.

29:41.954 --> 29:43.856
My brother and I had a slight disagreement

29:43.857 --> 29:45.057
over you, as a matter of fact.

29:45.058 --> 29:48.760
Oh! A duel in my honor. How chivalrous,

29:48.761 --> 29:51.029
but I'm afraid if this is what
you wish to show me, it's...

29:51.030 --> 29:52.798
If you want to know what's been in my heart

29:52.799 --> 29:55.654
for the past few centuries,

29:55.684 --> 29:57.936
come with me.

30:05.544 --> 30:08.646
Life is like a city, built in layers.

30:08.647 --> 30:12.647
No matter what new experiences come along,

30:13.585 --> 30:16.455
the foundation remains.

30:24.530 --> 30:25.997
(Gasps)

30:25.998 --> 30:27.866
What is this?

30:27.867 --> 30:31.303
200 yeas ago, it was my art studio.

30:31.304 --> 30:35.174
It became a tomb for my memory of you.

30:39.268 --> 30:41.395
I thought if I painted what haunted me

30:41.425 --> 30:44.613
I could free myself of you forever.

30:45.451 --> 30:47.519
In all my years,

30:47.520 --> 30:51.257
I have never been more
wrong about anything.

31:14.128 --> 31:15.462
Between blood loss and that bite,

31:15.463 --> 31:17.664
I'm not sure you have
enough time to get answers.

31:17.665 --> 31:21.067
Then let's make the most of it.

31:21.068 --> 31:23.804
I have questions.

31:27.107 --> 31:29.043
I want answers.

31:32.913 --> 31:34.215
Why were you following Hayley?

31:34.216 --> 31:37.150
I was ordered to remove her
from the playing field.

31:37.151 --> 31:40.220
She is an obstacle to the
thing we truly want.

31:40.221 --> 31:41.793
Which is what?

31:41.823 --> 31:44.192
Davina Claire.

31:45.059 --> 31:47.060
What do you want with Davina Claire?

31:47.061 --> 31:48.229
Tristan needs her to activate a weapon

31:48.230 --> 31:50.730
to use against your family.

31:50.731 --> 31:52.800
What weapon?

31:55.335 --> 31:59.732
Forgive me. I'm having a little
difficulty hearing you right now.

32:00.775 --> 32:02.280
Speak.

32:02.310 --> 32:03.744
I'd...

32:03.745 --> 32:05.079
Rather...

32:05.080 --> 32:06.915
Die.

32:07.949 --> 32:09.984
(Daylight ring clatters)

32:18.359 --> 32:20.260
Have you found it yet?

32:20.861 --> 32:22.429
Because as far as deadlines go,

32:22.430 --> 32:25.423
well, yours seems almost dead.

32:25.453 --> 32:26.801
You've made your point.

32:26.802 --> 32:30.837
You win, humans lose. Now let him go.

32:30.838 --> 32:31.934
So you have found it?

32:31.964 --> 32:35.385
Maybe. I'll only show you
if you heal him now.

32:35.415 --> 32:36.580
Show me first.

32:36.610 --> 32:38.946
Heal him.

32:48.089 --> 32:49.724
It's ok.

32:53.059 --> 32:55.830
You can drink it. It will heal you.

33:06.941 --> 33:09.342
I've checked everywhere else.

33:09.343 --> 33:12.279
This is the only place it could be.

33:26.427 --> 33:28.829
Aah!

33:32.900 --> 33:33.701
Ohh! Ohh!

33:33.702 --> 33:35.603
I can see why Nik is so fond of you.

33:35.604 --> 33:37.904
You do have spirit,

33:37.905 --> 33:40.473
but your heart skipped a beat

33:40.474 --> 33:41.742
just before I healed your friend.

33:41.743 --> 33:45.742
I think you know exactly where my
medallion is, you crafty girl.

33:48.716 --> 33:49.917
Knife to your throat, mate.

33:49.918 --> 33:52.552
No. Don't do this, please.

33:52.553 --> 33:54.288
Are you trying to appeal
to my merciful side?

33:54.289 --> 33:56.019
I hate to tell you, darling,
I don't have one.

33:56.049 --> 33:57.105
Don't give him a damn thing!

33:57.135 --> 33:58.583
Oh, enough!

34:00.147 --> 34:02.734
Go on. Slit your...

34:02.764 --> 34:04.632
Wait!

34:05.833 --> 34:07.734
Take it. Just take it.

34:07.735 --> 34:09.704
It's in here.

34:11.139 --> 34:17.338
Heh. Had it all along. How about that?

34:27.690 --> 34:30.658
Turns out we make quite a team.

34:33.928 --> 34:36.898
(Moroccan music playing)

34:43.972 --> 34:47.972
There it is. This has got to be it.

34:48.943 --> 34:51.378
Freya: If you were told
to meet this witch here,

34:51.379 --> 34:52.853
where is she?

34:52.882 --> 34:56.116
Doesn't matter to me as
long as I get what I need.

34:56.117 --> 34:58.986
This is it. This is the spell.

34:59.587 --> 35:01.288
It makes perfect sense. Now all we need

35:01.289 --> 35:03.990
is Kol's ashes and the
blood of two siblings.

35:03.991 --> 35:06.893
Rebekah, we need to go now.

35:06.894 --> 35:08.900
(Door opens)

35:08.930 --> 35:10.631
Took you long enough.

35:10.632 --> 35:12.399

35:12.400 --> 35:14.735
Mithil rata dans hofos.

35:14.736 --> 35:16.069
Mithil rata dans hofos.

35:16.070 --> 35:17.804
What the hell is going on?

35:17.805 --> 35:21.142
A fitting end to a spoiled bitch.

35:25.713 --> 35:27.215
(Grunts)

35:31.352 --> 35:33.254
Clearly you didn't get the hint earlier.

35:33.255 --> 35:34.522
You can't beat me!

35:34.523 --> 35:37.329
Maybe not, but she can.

35:37.359 --> 35:39.360
Lem duree mohana.

35:39.361 --> 35:40.361
No!

35:40.362 --> 35:41.496
Gratuit fra loke!

35:41.497 --> 35:43.932
(Voices whispering)

35:44.701 --> 35:46.837
No. No.

35:46.867 --> 35:48.002
Aya: Your magic has no power here.

35:48.830 --> 35:51.506
Only our witch can cast spells.

35:53.200 --> 35:55.576
How tragic, that you and your sister

35:55.606 --> 35:57.646
must say your farewells like this.

36:00.181 --> 36:02.148
I can't decide.

36:02.149 --> 36:03.450
Should I make you watch

36:03.451 --> 36:06.520
as she screams for mercy

36:06.521 --> 36:07.888
or leave you wondering

36:07.889 --> 36:09.357
just how badly she suffered?

36:09.358 --> 36:13.357
If you hurt her, I will rip your l... unh!

36:23.237 --> 36:24.838
You lured me all this way,

36:24.839 --> 36:26.573
and the whole time, it was a lie.

36:26.574 --> 36:28.008
Not at all.

36:28.009 --> 36:30.577
The spell is very real.

36:30.578 --> 36:33.213
I wanted to enjoy the look on your face

36:33.214 --> 36:36.249
when I took it from you.

36:36.250 --> 36:39.419
Not to worry, luv. This won't kill you.

36:39.420 --> 36:41.255
It's just meant to put you to sleep

36:41.256 --> 36:43.490
for a very, very long time.

36:43.491 --> 36:44.959
And when I wake up, you will be

36:44.960 --> 36:47.494
the first person that I kill.

36:47.495 --> 36:49.329
I won't hold my breath,

36:49.330 --> 36:52.933
but you're more than welcome to try.

36:52.934 --> 36:55.469
(Grunting)

37:06.514 --> 37:10.514
Now time to get you back to New Orleans.

37:19.475 --> 37:21.461
He cooks, and he cleans!

37:21.462 --> 37:23.997
He's a real keeper, this one.

37:23.998 --> 37:27.267
Aw. Sadly, it was not meant to be.

37:27.268 --> 37:30.904
Now you will go and tell your superiors

37:30.905 --> 37:33.173
you arrested the wrong suspect.

37:33.174 --> 37:34.908
You can compel me all you want.

37:34.909 --> 37:37.231
I will find you.

37:37.261 --> 37:39.195
No, you won't.

37:40.008 --> 37:44.345
Instead, you'll keep up this
wretched failure that is your life.

37:44.375 --> 37:46.836
You'll continue with this
pitiful investigation,

37:46.837 --> 37:48.139
never quite connecting the dots

37:48.140 --> 37:50.711
or making any progress whatsoever.

37:50.741 --> 37:54.577
After a time, you'll grow to hate yourself

37:54.578 --> 37:56.113
for your mediocre talent,

37:56.143 --> 37:59.579
all the while knowing there are
things lurking in the shadows,

38:00.751 --> 38:02.492
and in the face of these,

38:02.522 --> 38:05.222
you are nothing.

38:07.391 --> 38:08.830
Don't do this.

38:08.860 --> 38:11.395
Oh, don't look so chagrined.

38:11.396 --> 38:12.964
Eh, once the vervain's out your system,

38:12.965 --> 38:15.970
I'll compel you to forget, as well,

38:16.452 --> 38:19.870
but like him, I will leave
you with one lesson.

38:19.871 --> 38:22.005
Against vampires,

38:22.006 --> 38:25.442
humans always lose.

wanted was to find my family.

39:06.784 --> 39:10.120
It consumed me,

39:10.121 --> 39:12.956
and then once I did, as crazy as it is,

39:12.957 --> 39:14.658
all I wanted was a home,

39:14.659 --> 39:18.796
and New Orleans is that home...

39:20.098 --> 39:24.098
And The Strix are trying
to take that, aren't they?

39:25.536 --> 39:28.639
No. We won't let them.

39:28.640 --> 39:30.007
(Footsteps)

39:30.008 --> 39:32.810
Might be harder than you think.

I think it's best you
remain out of arm's reach.

40:05.109 --> 40:06.897
(Sighs)

40:06.927 --> 40:08.931
So I take it you've heard
about the busy day

40:08.961 --> 40:10.447
everyone's had.

40:10.448 --> 40:13.884
Let me take away that scowl.

40:13.885 --> 40:15.986
I'll tell you everything I know.

40:15.987 --> 40:19.057
I suggest you speak quickly.

40:20.091 --> 40:22.159
There is a weapon in play,

40:22.160 --> 40:24.895
a dangerous, cursed device

40:24.896 --> 40:26.563
called The Serratura.

40:27.235 --> 40:30.033
It is capable of producing
an unbreakable boundary.

40:30.795 --> 40:33.295
My brother and Lucien want to use it

40:33.325 --> 40:35.439
to lock you and your siblings away forever

40:35.440 --> 40:37.710
so that no one may harm you,

40:37.740 --> 40:41.514
but to do so, they need all
3 of you in one place.

40:41.544 --> 40:45.148
Which is why they sent a legion
of Strix to collect my sister.

40:45.149 --> 40:47.048
But not to worry, my love.

40:47.078 --> 40:49.385
I took measures to ensure
that Rebekah isn't held

40:49.386 --> 40:52.029
by those nasty Strix for long.

40:52.059 --> 40:53.823
What measures?

40:53.824 --> 40:56.359
While they did acquire Rebekah's body,

40:56.360 --> 40:58.229
I wasn't about to let them keep it,

40:58.230 --> 41:01.564
so I enacted a plan of my own.

41:01.565 --> 41:04.200
Unbeknownst to my brother,
two of the men sent

41:04.201 --> 41:07.301
to retrieve her were from my sire line,

41:07.331 --> 41:09.907
loyal to me...

41:10.809 --> 41:12.776
And on my behalf,

41:12.777 --> 41:15.945
they procured your sister's body.

41:15.946 --> 41:18.014
So don't worry, my love.

41:18.015 --> 41:20.748
Rebekah is perfectly safe.

41:20.981 --> 41:24.355
You have my word.

41:25.537 --> 41:27.892
Now...

41:29.907 --> 41:32.797
Come back to bed.
