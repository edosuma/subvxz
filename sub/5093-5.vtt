WEBVTT

00:08.275 --> 00:12.144
I, uh, wish we could have
a more public ceremony,

00:12.146 --> 00:15.164
but due to the sensitive nature
of Bobby's work overseas...

00:15.166 --> 00:17.265
Completely understood, sir.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.985
Tommy.

00:19.987 --> 00:21.570
You hold that for me,
all right?

00:21.572 --> 00:22.938
There you go.

00:24.791 --> 00:26.041
Let's do this.

00:26.043 --> 00:29.495
The NYPD deploys officers
around the globe

00:29.497 --> 00:32.747
to combat terrorists
and keep our city safe.

00:32.750 --> 00:36.118
While detailed to the NYPD's
International Liaison Program

00:36.120 --> 00:38.554
in Malaysia,
Detective Mulrow

00:38.556 --> 00:40.673
played a leading role
in the capture

00:40.675 --> 00:41.890
of a terrorist drug lord,

00:41.892 --> 00:44.476
whose network
of criminal activity

00:44.478 --> 00:46.312
had reached all the way
to our city.

00:53.770 --> 00:57.189
In recognition of
his courage and his skill,

00:57.191 --> 01:01.327
it is my honor to present
Detective Robert Payson Mulrow

01:01.329 --> 01:03.162
with the Medal for Valor.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:14.090 --> 01:15.858
Well done.

01:27.721 --> 01:28.771
Congratulations.

01:28.773 --> 01:30.222
Way to go, Bobby.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.640
Thanks, Danny.

01:31.642 --> 01:33.225
Look, I-I know
how hard this work

01:33.227 --> 01:35.227
can be on the family,
so that medal

01:35.229 --> 01:37.212
belongs to you
and Tommy, too.

01:38.314 --> 01:39.698
But Bobby's back home now.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.150
Let's keep it that way.

01:41.152 --> 01:43.202
That'd be great.
(chuckles)

01:43.204 --> 01:45.904
I'm gonna give this to you.
Okay.

01:47.957 --> 01:49.658
Congratulations.
Thank you.

01:54.363 --> 01:55.431
Nice digs, Dad.

01:55.433 --> 01:57.199
Don't touch a thing.
Nope.

01:57.201 --> 01:59.451
Just wondering if I'll
ever get a big-boy office

01:59.453 --> 02:00.452
like this one day.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.838
Requires fortitude,
patience

02:02.840 --> 02:04.339
and grace under
pressure.

02:04.341 --> 02:06.308
So, how'd you
get the keys?

02:06.310 --> 02:08.911
Get back to work.
Sir.

02:18.221 --> 02:19.988
Ooh!

02:19.990 --> 02:21.240
Lucky shot.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.225
Rack 'em, sucker.

02:23.227 --> 02:25.077
Are you making
the cake for, uh...

02:25.079 --> 02:26.912
for Henry's big anniversary?
Mm-mm.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.447
It's Linda

02:28.449 --> 02:30.866
60 years since Grandpa
joined the NYPD.

02:30.868 --> 02:31.834
Can you believe that?

02:31.836 --> 02:33.502
Yeah.

02:33.504 --> 02:34.670
Wonder how that
makes him feel.

02:34.672 --> 02:36.171
I'm guessing old.

02:36.173 --> 02:38.323
He asked me
to do a ride-along

02:38.325 --> 02:40.575
to mark the anniversary.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.743
Two days, no less.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.879
Wow, Henry Reagan
rides again.

02:43.881 --> 02:45.347
You going to
take him out?

02:45.349 --> 02:46.915
Absolutely.
I think it'll be fun.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.967
If you say so.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.018
(giggles)

02:50.020 --> 02:51.136
Come on.

02:51.138 --> 02:52.554
It's got to be
hard for him, you know?

02:52.556 --> 02:53.856
Sitting back
while the rest of us

02:53.858 --> 02:55.057
are still out doing the job.

02:55.059 --> 02:58.744
Well, I'm sure he will
be very well-behaved.

02:58.746 --> 03:01.429
Just make sure...

03:01.431 --> 03:04.099
that he keeps his gun at home.

03:05.652 --> 03:07.653
I can't believe it.

03:07.655 --> 03:10.906
(whistles)

03:12.041 --> 03:13.992
Frank.

03:21.017 --> 03:22.885
This popped into
your e-mail.

03:24.504 --> 03:25.804
Commissioner,

03:25.806 --> 03:27.673
the transaction
is a simple one.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.175
You have in your custody
a very important member

03:30.177 --> 03:31.844
of our organization.

03:31.846 --> 03:33.896
Give us back Abdul Sayid,

03:33.898 --> 03:35.981
and we will give
you back your man.

03:38.801 --> 03:41.653
You have 24 hours to comply.

03:41.655 --> 03:45.807
If you fail,
Detective Mulrow dies.

This is Officer Reynolds,
Commissioner,

04:26.991 --> 04:28.908
head of CIA's
Malaysia bureau.

04:31.361 --> 04:33.295
Who's this guy?

04:33.297 --> 04:34.947
This is Omar Sayid,

04:34.949 --> 04:37.082
the number two in the
Malaysian drug cartel

04:37.084 --> 04:38.617
that Detective Mulrow
helped decimate

04:38.619 --> 04:40.169
while he was
stationed there.

04:40.171 --> 04:41.620
The sender's address

04:41.622 --> 04:43.172
It'll take us a few
days to crack.

04:43.174 --> 04:45.724
New e-mail came in
six minutes ago.

04:46.927 --> 04:48.727
"Secure Abdul Sayid.

04:48.729 --> 04:51.147
Then await instructions."

04:51.149 --> 04:52.515
His brother, Abdul Sayid.

04:52.517 --> 04:56.769
We took him down in Morningside
Heights six months ago.

04:56.771 --> 04:59.238
Abdul ran the New York crew
for his brother, Omar.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.473
Just got 20 years for
trafficking in narcotics.

05:01.475 --> 05:04.693
Due to Detective Mulrow's
work in Malaysia.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.662
Abdul is scheduled to
be moved from The Tombs

05:06.664 --> 05:09.665
to Rikers before they send him
upstate, at which point

05:09.667 --> 05:13.202
he will no longer be within
jurisdiction with the NYPD.

05:13.204 --> 05:14.870
This Omar is a smart guy.

05:14.872 --> 05:17.373
I take it the Agency's
familiar with him?

05:17.375 --> 05:19.758
Drug trafficking,
extortion, murder.

05:19.760 --> 05:21.544
The Sayids are
the real deal.

05:22.328 --> 05:23.712
I worked with
Detective Mulrow

05:23.714 --> 05:26.265
on a number of joint operations.

05:26.267 --> 05:27.800
He's a good man.

05:29.335 --> 05:31.103
I want him back.

05:31.105 --> 05:32.805
Abduction is standard
operating procedure

05:32.807 --> 05:34.273
for the Sayids.

05:34.275 --> 05:36.725
They have a history of
executing their prisoners,

05:36.727 --> 05:39.128
and they never negotiate.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.946
Respectfully,
the Sayids

05:40.948 --> 05:43.015
are on our terrorist
organization list.

05:43.017 --> 05:45.201
The Agency has a
standing policy to...

05:45.203 --> 05:48.186
Never negotiate with terrorists.

05:48.188 --> 05:49.822
The Agency would
strongly urge you

05:49.824 --> 05:51.824
to hold that line,
Commissioner.

05:53.043 --> 05:55.411
The unfortunate
truth is,

05:55.413 --> 05:56.996
given the M.O. of the Sayids,

05:56.998 --> 05:59.531
Detective Mulrow may
already be dead.

06:02.802 --> 06:03.886
Commissioner?

06:03.888 --> 06:05.921
Excuse me.

06:13.563 --> 06:14.813
You know why you're here?

06:14.815 --> 06:16.148
DANNY: Only that
Bobby Mulrow

06:16.150 --> 06:17.716
has been taken.

06:22.022 --> 06:24.323
Sit down.

06:25.775 --> 06:28.444
Detective Reagan.
Sir.

06:28.446 --> 06:30.529
You know him.
That could give us

06:30.531 --> 06:32.281
an edge down the line.

06:32.283 --> 06:33.999
Detective Croft,
you were stationed

06:34.001 --> 06:36.001
in the region where
the kidnappers operate.

06:36.003 --> 06:37.736
You know their methods.

06:37.738 --> 06:41.206
Just as importantly,
I know you both.

06:41.208 --> 06:42.374
And you know me.

06:42.376 --> 06:46.795
There is an irregular aspect
to what I am doing here.

06:46.797 --> 06:49.632
The involvement of
foreign nationals necessitates

06:49.634 --> 06:51.750
that federal authorities
will be involved

06:51.752 --> 06:53.251
in this investigation.

06:53.253 --> 06:54.853
But make no mistake,

06:54.855 --> 06:58.290
you two will run
this operation--

06:58.292 --> 06:59.525
reporting directly to me.

06:59.527 --> 07:01.143
Understood?
Yes, sir.

07:01.145 --> 07:03.212
Yes, sir.

07:03.214 --> 07:05.230
Responsibility
for Bobby Mulrow's life

07:05.232 --> 07:08.817
tracks directly to this office.

07:08.819 --> 07:09.785
No press.

07:09.787 --> 07:11.436
They get their
lights on it,

07:11.438 --> 07:13.372
my ability to control
the situation

07:13.374 --> 07:14.406
will go out the window.

07:14.408 --> 07:15.791
Got it.

07:15.793 --> 07:18.460
Leave those files on my desk
when you've finished reading.

07:18.462 --> 07:22.131
There's a clock
on this.

07:22.133 --> 07:23.215
Find him.

07:23.217 --> 07:26.168
Sir.

07:31.091 --> 07:32.558
What do you got, Sam?

07:32.560 --> 07:34.960
Hey. All right.
So, Mulrow dropped off

07:34.962 --> 07:36.762
his wife and kid,
then goes to buy some milk

07:36.764 --> 07:37.896
at the bodega
around the corner.

07:37.898 --> 07:40.232
Now, three gunmen in a
late-model white cargo van

07:40.234 --> 07:41.400
were waiting.

07:41.402 --> 07:42.801
They kidnapped him
as he walked back,

07:42.803 --> 07:44.136
tossed him in
the van, sped away.

07:44.138 --> 07:45.738
All right, how we
doing on witnesses?

07:45.740 --> 07:46.939
The perps wore ski masks,

07:46.941 --> 07:48.023
but we got a partial plate.

07:48.025 --> 07:49.274
Running it through RTCC.

07:49.276 --> 07:52.194
All right, let's pull all
the video from the area.

07:52.196 --> 07:54.646
TARU counts 15
cameras so far.

07:54.648 --> 07:56.198
All right.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.449
It's a hell of a situation.

07:57.451 --> 07:59.284
It's the worst.
Well, despite the circumstances,

07:59.286 --> 08:01.704
I'm glad to be working
this with you, Danny.

08:01.706 --> 08:03.539
Same here.

08:05.842 --> 08:07.843
Damn it.

08:09.796 --> 08:10.963
Is that the wife?

08:10.965 --> 08:13.465
Yeah, and his son.

08:13.467 --> 08:15.718
How do you know Mulrow?

08:15.720 --> 08:18.003
We were in the same company
in the academy together.

08:18.005 --> 08:20.672
Look, um, Henry Hudson Bridge
is really close to here,

08:20.674 --> 08:22.057
so if they did
leave Manhattan,

08:22.059 --> 08:23.726
that's probably
the way they went.

08:23.728 --> 08:25.060
I'm going to have
to talk to her.

08:25.062 --> 08:26.845
All right, I'll get MTA on the horn.
Thanks.

08:30.734 --> 08:31.984
You need to find Bobby.

08:31.986 --> 08:33.818
Look, we're doing
all we can.

08:33.821 --> 08:35.320
I lived without my
husband for two years

08:35.322 --> 08:36.538
when he was in Malaysia.

08:36.539 --> 08:37.740
Tommy lived
without a father.

08:37.741 --> 08:39.357
He finally comes home,
and now this?

08:39.359 --> 08:40.542
We're doing all we can.

08:40.544 --> 08:42.995
He has given
everything to the job.

08:42.996 --> 08:44.663
And me and Tommy...

08:44.665 --> 08:46.698
we gave him.

08:48.551 --> 08:51.553
You bring him
back for us.

08:58.812 --> 09:02.398
I think it's time to
talk to Abdul Sayid.

09:04.350 --> 09:07.369
Assistant District
Attorney Reagan, sir.

09:07.371 --> 09:09.655
I came as soon as I
got your e-mail.

09:09.657 --> 09:10.889
Is everything okay?

09:11.858 --> 09:13.275
That would be a no.

09:13.277 --> 09:15.944
I know the DEFCON level by
the look on your face.

09:17.063 --> 09:19.448
And you're not going to
tell me what's going on.

09:19.450 --> 09:20.916
How can I help?

09:20.918 --> 09:21.900
I need an order written up

09:21.902 --> 09:23.619
to remove a prisoner
from custody.

09:23.621 --> 09:25.537
His name is Abdul Sayid.

09:25.539 --> 09:27.122
Confidential?

09:27.124 --> 09:29.908
Highly.
And who should I put down

09:29.910 --> 09:31.410
as the requesting officer?

09:32.545 --> 09:34.046
Put me down.

09:34.048 --> 09:35.931
Well, that's a first.

09:38.802 --> 09:41.086
Hang in there.

09:46.893 --> 09:48.143
So, by getting
a take-out order

09:48.145 --> 09:49.945
written up for
Sayid's brother...

09:49.947 --> 09:52.764
I am preparing for
all eventualities.

09:54.868 --> 09:56.268
Meaning you're ready
to negotiate

09:56.270 --> 09:57.569
with terrorists?

09:57.571 --> 10:00.155
Meaning I want the terrorists
to be under the impression

10:00.157 --> 10:02.658
I'm doing everything they ask.

10:10.667 --> 10:12.050
(door lock buzzes, clicks)

10:21.094 --> 10:23.896
Just have a few questions
for you, Abdul.

10:23.898 --> 10:25.681
When's the last time you
heard from your brother?

10:25.683 --> 10:27.933
They take away your cell phone
when you go to prison.

10:27.935 --> 10:28.984
Cut the crap.

10:28.986 --> 10:30.819
Your brother Omar
ordered the abduction

10:30.821 --> 10:32.254
of a New York City
police detective.

10:32.256 --> 10:35.073
He has problems
with authority.

10:35.075 --> 10:36.808
I think it runs in the family.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.977
I understand you're
going to be locked up

10:38.979 --> 10:41.280
in an American prison
for a long time.

10:41.282 --> 10:43.866
I came here to give you a chance
to do yourself some good.

10:43.868 --> 10:45.834
By ratting out my brother?

10:45.836 --> 10:48.587
(chuckles)

10:48.589 --> 10:49.705
We're not Americans.

10:49.707 --> 10:50.956
We don't betray our own.

10:50.958 --> 10:52.191
Really?

10:52.193 --> 10:53.959
Let me put it to
you like this:

10:53.961 --> 10:56.712
If our guy dies, you're going
to have a serious problem.

10:56.714 --> 10:58.714
You help us find
Detective Mulrow,

10:58.716 --> 11:01.049
you could walk out the door.

11:01.051 --> 11:04.002
Your detective stuck his nose
where it didn't belong.

11:04.004 --> 11:07.139
In my country,
you pay a price for that.

11:07.141 --> 11:08.273
That detective did his job,

11:08.275 --> 11:10.342
and this isn't your country,
smart-ass.

11:10.344 --> 11:11.527
Take my advice.

11:11.529 --> 11:15.781
If you want your detective
back in one piece,

11:15.783 --> 11:17.816
give my brother what he wants.

11:24.357 --> 11:25.874
You get anything off
Abdul Sayid?

11:25.876 --> 11:27.192
Nothing but attitude.

11:27.194 --> 11:28.577
He know what his
brother's up to?

11:28.579 --> 11:30.662
Of course he does, but he's
too smart to say anything.

11:30.664 --> 11:32.915
We did get this, however,
from the MTA Police.

11:32.917 --> 11:35.133
It was taken by a
toll booth camera

11:35.135 --> 11:36.168
at the Henry
Hudson Bridge

11:36.170 --> 11:37.336
three minutes
after the snatch.

11:37.338 --> 11:40.005
And he's the driver
who snatched up Mulrow.

11:40.007 --> 11:42.040
We ran it through Facial
Recognition Unit-- nothing.

11:42.042 --> 11:43.725
Anybody left from
Abdul's New York crew

11:43.727 --> 11:44.709
might be a part of this?

11:44.711 --> 11:45.894
Anybody from his crew
is either dead

11:45.896 --> 11:47.563
or locked up
except for one guy.

11:47.565 --> 11:48.713
Jamal Khan.

11:48.715 --> 11:50.515
Paroled last month,
did 18 months

11:50.517 --> 11:52.067
for Assault Two,
more of an associate

11:52.069 --> 11:53.735
of Sayid's crew
than an actual member.

11:53.737 --> 11:55.687
Uh-huh.
Pretty low-level guy.

11:55.689 --> 11:57.322
Well, he's the best
we got, Sarge,

11:57.324 --> 11:59.358
and seeing how we've got
12 hours and 22 minutes left,

11:59.360 --> 12:00.576
he's going to have to do.

12:02.862 --> 12:04.696
Well, did you send
a team to pick him up?

12:04.698 --> 12:05.864
He wasn't home.
For all we know,

12:05.866 --> 12:07.332
he got wind of this,
went into hiding.

12:07.334 --> 12:09.734
So how the hell do we find him?
Abdul Sayid

12:09.736 --> 12:11.086
used to hang
out at a hot spot

12:11.088 --> 12:12.371
called the Bahru Bar.

12:12.373 --> 12:14.373
It's very trendy with
the Malaysian population.

12:14.375 --> 12:16.708
Who knows? Maybe someone there
knows who Jamal Khan is.

12:16.710 --> 12:18.844
All right. Go.

12:18.846 --> 12:20.662
CRUZ: Damn good breakfast,
Commissioner.

12:20.664 --> 12:22.497
HENRY: Yeah, but you've
got to make it a point

12:22.499 --> 12:24.466
of hitting this
joint for lunch.

12:24.468 --> 12:26.802
His mom's lasagna
is so good,

12:26.804 --> 12:29.021
I used to order trays of it
down to headquarters.

12:29.023 --> 12:31.723
And for the last time,
call me Henry.

12:31.725 --> 12:33.642
Can't accept meals on
the arm anymore, Grandpa.

12:33.644 --> 12:35.444
Well, I could hardly
insult the man.

12:35.446 --> 12:38.313
DISPATCH: Sector Adam,
pick up a 10-52 dispute

12:38.315 --> 12:40.616
on street in front
of 933 9th Avenue.

12:40.618 --> 12:42.818
Oh, God.
Not these idiots again.

12:42.820 --> 12:44.736
That address sounds familiar.

12:44.738 --> 12:46.104
Salducci's Pizza.

12:46.106 --> 12:47.239
Salducci!

12:47.241 --> 12:49.074
Sure. It's an institution.

12:49.076 --> 12:50.942
Before I met
your grandmother,

12:50.944 --> 12:52.995
I used to eat there maybe
two, three times a week.

12:52.997 --> 12:55.547
And the best
slice in the city.

12:55.549 --> 12:57.666
I bet it was free
back then, too, huh?

12:57.668 --> 12:58.634
Mm.

12:58.636 --> 13:00.886
What's the beef
with Salducci?

13:00.888 --> 13:03.639
Uh, brother and sister who own
the place had a falling out.

13:03.641 --> 13:05.007
She goes and buys
a pizza truck,

13:05.009 --> 13:06.892
parks it right out front,
to break his chops.

13:06.894 --> 13:07.843
(chuckles)

13:07.845 --> 13:09.428
Hell hath no fury, right?

13:09.430 --> 13:12.130
12 George,
show us responding.

13:25.662 --> 13:29.915
(Malaysian broadcaster speaking)

13:29.917 --> 13:32.401
(cheering, applause)

13:37.140 --> 13:41.259
Police. We need to ask you
some questions.

13:43.763 --> 13:45.263
Okay, then.

13:48.551 --> 13:49.434
(crowd groans)

13:49.436 --> 13:50.435
Shut up.

13:50.437 --> 13:51.720
Up against the wall
and stay there.

13:51.722 --> 13:53.438
Quiet down! Quiet down.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.524
You heard him.
He said, "Shut up."

13:55.526 --> 13:57.776
Now, the sooner you give us
what we need, the sooner

13:57.778 --> 13:59.945
you all can go
back to your soccer game.

13:59.947 --> 14:01.963
Jamal Khan is a
person of interest

14:01.965 --> 14:04.282
in the abduction of a
New York City police officer.

14:04.284 --> 14:06.068
We know that
Jamal Khan likes

14:06.070 --> 14:08.353
to hang out in this
bar with Sayid's crew.

14:08.355 --> 14:11.856
We need the location or the
whereabouts for Jamal Khan.

14:11.858 --> 14:12.874
So who's talking?

14:12.876 --> 14:15.077
(speaking quietly in Malay)

14:15.079 --> 14:16.712
SAM: American cops are
all cowboys, huh?

14:16.714 --> 14:18.380
I spent four months
in Putrajaya,

14:18.382 --> 14:20.465
I know exactly what
you're saying. Shut up.

14:20.467 --> 14:22.200
Unless you've got
something to offer.

14:23.302 --> 14:25.587
The Sayids are animals.

14:25.589 --> 14:27.205
They'll kill anyone
who talks to you.

14:27.207 --> 14:29.207
(men murmuring agreement)

14:29.209 --> 14:32.344
DANNY: We're not here
to jam anybody up, okay?

14:32.346 --> 14:34.262
In fact, I'm sure many
of you got something

14:34.264 --> 14:36.314
in your pockets
you probably shouldn't have.

14:36.316 --> 14:39.468
I'm sure others have
green card issues.

14:39.470 --> 14:40.685
But today is your lucky day,

14:40.687 --> 14:42.237
because we don't care
about any of that.

14:42.239 --> 14:46.575
All we care about today is the
whereabouts or an address

14:46.577 --> 14:47.826
for Jamal Khan.

14:47.828 --> 14:50.028
So we can do this
the easy way,

14:50.030 --> 14:52.230
or we can do it
the hard way.

14:53.750 --> 14:55.333
Okay.

14:55.335 --> 14:56.585
We'll do it the hard way.

14:56.587 --> 14:59.254
Everybody, empty your pockets
onto the table-- now.

14:59.256 --> 15:01.540
Come on!
Pockets! Table! Now!

15:05.628 --> 15:07.028
Yo, Danny.

15:17.774 --> 15:20.392
Thank you for your cooperation.

15:20.394 --> 15:23.061
Enjoy the rest of the game.

15:36.659 --> 15:38.109
DANNY:
Jamal Khan.

15:38.111 --> 15:39.611
Need to talk to you.

15:39.613 --> 15:41.279
Where you going?

15:41.281 --> 15:43.465
You're on parole,
and you run from a cop?

15:43.467 --> 15:45.167
(grunts) I've got
nothing to say.

15:45.169 --> 15:47.169
Yeah, is that why
you're hiding out, Jamal?

15:47.171 --> 15:48.720
Hello.

15:48.722 --> 15:50.722
Jamal is carrying something
besides groceries.

15:50.724 --> 15:51.973
Look, I'm sorry,
I don't want

15:51.975 --> 15:53.341
to go back to jail!

15:53.343 --> 15:54.959
Well, if you're smart
for once in your life,

15:54.961 --> 15:56.011
maybe you won't have to.

15:56.013 --> 15:57.395
We need you to answer
some questions now.

15:57.397 --> 15:59.397
You seen any of your old pals
from Sayid's crew?

15:59.399 --> 16:00.798
I'm on parole.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.767
I'm not allowed to
congregate with felons.

16:03.686 --> 16:05.070
Says the guy with the gun.

16:05.072 --> 16:05.987
You being cute?

16:05.989 --> 16:07.439
I'm telling you the truth.
Hey.

16:07.441 --> 16:08.940
These guys
kidnapped a cop.

16:08.942 --> 16:10.475
Which puts me
in a bad mood.

16:10.477 --> 16:12.611
And since we put you with
those guys since you got out,

16:12.613 --> 16:14.412
that makes you part of it,
you understand me?

16:14.414 --> 16:15.914
No way.

16:15.916 --> 16:17.415
I'm done with the Sayids.

16:17.417 --> 16:19.534
Prove it.

16:19.536 --> 16:20.669
You know this guy?

16:20.671 --> 16:22.087
He's one of the kidnappers.

16:22.089 --> 16:23.655
Give us a name
and address now.

16:24.657 --> 16:25.707
Come on!

16:25.709 --> 16:27.425
That guy's the least
of your worries.

16:28.261 --> 16:29.678
That's Karim Naduri.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.546
He used to be Abdul's driver.

16:31.548 --> 16:33.048
Give me an address.

16:33.050 --> 16:34.549
He has a place
over on Alexander.

16:34.551 --> 16:35.833
Get specific fast.

16:35.835 --> 16:38.370
422 Alexander.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.388
We'll keep the g.

16:40.390 --> 16:42.274
You keep the groceries.

16:50.283 --> 16:51.616
SAM:
<i>Why didn't Naduri show up</i>

16:51.618 --> 16:53.351
on our list of Sayid's guys?

16:53.353 --> 16:55.403
He was deported three years ago.

16:55.405 --> 16:56.872
Abdul's brother must
have brought him back

16:56.874 --> 16:58.790
in the country
to snatch up Mulrow.

17:00.459 --> 17:01.960
This looks like the spot.

17:04.747 --> 17:06.580
All right.

17:06.583 --> 17:08.700
Let's go.
Whoa, whoa, hold it.

17:13.872 --> 17:16.558
Oh, nice when the perps
come right to you, huh?

17:17.760 --> 17:19.711
What the hell is this?

17:19.713 --> 17:21.146
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

17:21.147 --> 17:22.931
That's a school safety cop.

17:24.099 --> 17:25.767
He doesn't know that.

17:25.769 --> 17:27.736
Police! Drop it!

17:27.738 --> 17:30.338
(Naduri yells)

17:32.024 --> 17:35.076
No! No! No!

17:35.078 --> 17:36.027
(whimpers)

17:36.029 --> 17:37.228
SAM: I got the girl.
I got the girl.

17:37.230 --> 17:38.830
ELENA: Don't shoot me!
Don't shoot me!

17:38.832 --> 17:39.998
Get up! Get up!
Get your hands down.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.232
Get up.
I didn't do nothing!

17:41.234 --> 17:43.168
Shut up, all right?
I didn't do nothing.

17:43.170 --> 17:44.586
I didn't do nothing.

17:46.205 --> 17:48.039
ELENA: I didn't
do nothing.

17:48.041 --> 17:49.524
Is he gone?

17:49.526 --> 17:51.376
Yeah, he's gone.

17:51.378 --> 17:53.461
Gone, but not forgotten.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.764
Our only lead.

17:55.766 --> 17:56.965
(sighs)

18:10.118 --> 18:11.502
You didn't have to shoot him.

18:11.504 --> 18:12.970
Yes, we did.

18:12.972 --> 18:15.723
Which is too bad, because
we needed to talk to him.

18:15.725 --> 18:17.842
Your boyfriend was
involved in the kidnapping

18:17.844 --> 18:19.343
of a police officer.

18:19.345 --> 18:21.262
Do you know anything
about that, Elena?

18:21.264 --> 18:22.930
No.

18:22.932 --> 18:24.398
Karim didn't tell me
nothing about that stuff.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.484
Where was Karim last night?

18:27.736 --> 18:29.186
Was he with you?

18:30.655 --> 18:32.189
He left around 7:00 p.m.

18:32.191 --> 18:34.158
He came back this morning
all jacked up.

18:34.160 --> 18:36.243
That's all I know.

18:36.245 --> 18:37.695
Jacked up.

18:37.697 --> 18:39.830
How? On drugs, jacked up?

18:39.832 --> 18:41.315
Big-time.

18:41.317 --> 18:43.167
What was his
drug of choice?

18:43.169 --> 18:45.319
Come on, did he like
coke, heroin, what?

18:45.321 --> 18:47.087
Pills, he liked pills--
prescription stuff.

18:47.089 --> 18:48.506
Did he get them
from a doctor?

18:48.508 --> 18:49.957
Yeah, right.

18:49.959 --> 18:53.160
He and the guys would break into
drugstores, take what they want.

18:53.162 --> 18:54.762
Call them "candy stores."

18:55.764 --> 18:57.181
Okay.

18:57.183 --> 18:59.183
Sit tight.

18:59.185 --> 19:00.551
Are you
out of your mind?!

19:00.553 --> 19:01.602
Are you serious?
Are you crazy?!

19:01.604 --> 19:02.653
Are you kidding me?

19:02.655 --> 19:04.638
This is my business.
This is what we do here.

19:04.640 --> 19:07.391
This is my business. This is ridiculous.
It's not your business.

19:07.393 --> 19:08.893
Go ahead, sue me, Joey.
You're the one

19:08.895 --> 19:10.895
running the business into the ground.
Yeah? This gourmet crap?

19:10.897 --> 19:12.463
Are you kidding me?
This crap?

19:12.465 --> 19:14.615
This crap is the
future, you moron.

19:14.617 --> 19:16.066
Hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:16.068 --> 19:18.369
CRUZ: Back, back,
back up, back up.

19:18.371 --> 19:20.237
Take a couple steps back.
What did we tell you earlier?

19:20.239 --> 19:22.206
If we had to come
back out here,

19:22.208 --> 19:24.875
we was gonna write you both up
for disorderly conduct, right?

19:24.877 --> 19:26.193
You think she listens?

19:26.195 --> 19:27.795
I got a permit
to sell here.

19:27.797 --> 19:28.712
Yeah, screw you!

19:28.714 --> 19:29.863
Drop dead!
All right. Back up.

19:29.865 --> 19:31.382
Back up.
Against the wall. Back up.

19:31.384 --> 19:32.983
JAMIE: Relax.
Stay there, please.

19:32.985 --> 19:34.251
Stay put.

19:37.255 --> 19:38.522
(scoffs)

19:38.524 --> 19:40.658
All right, look, if we slap
the cuffs on them,

19:40.660 --> 19:41.725
we bring them down
to the precinct,

19:41.727 --> 19:42.927
we run warrant checks
on them,

19:42.929 --> 19:44.595
their squabbling
days will be over.

19:44.597 --> 19:46.313
That'd smarten them up,
all right.

19:46.315 --> 19:48.292
Come on, it's just
a family argument, right?

19:48.317 --> 19:49.351
Second one today.

19:49.352 --> 19:52.403
It's the third one this week
that ended in a 911 call.

19:52.405 --> 19:54.438
We haul them in, it's just
going to make things worse.

19:54.440 --> 19:57.224
And if you don't, you'll
just be back here by sundown.

19:58.410 --> 20:01.078
Sometimes a kick in the ass
is worth a thousand words.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.580
I agree with Henry, man.
Enough with the talking.

20:02.582 --> 20:05.399
Let's run 'em in.
Whatever.

20:05.401 --> 20:07.501
You can ride
along any time.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.137
Okay, folks...

20:10.139 --> 20:11.956
Commissioner.

20:11.958 --> 20:13.591
Yes, Baker.
Alyssa Mulrow is here...

20:13.593 --> 20:15.793
He's my husband,
Commissioner.

20:15.795 --> 20:16.844
We have a strong
marriage

20:16.846 --> 20:18.078
'cause we don't
have any secrets.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.514
Which means I know what
you can and can't do

20:20.516 --> 20:22.933
when somebody like Bobby
falls into enemy hands.

20:22.935 --> 20:24.251
I know what
the rules are.

20:24.253 --> 20:26.086
You don't negotiate
with terrorists,

20:26.088 --> 20:29.023
and these guys that have Bobby,
they want something, right?

20:30.058 --> 20:31.141
Yes.

20:31.143 --> 20:33.727
I'm begging you...

20:33.729 --> 20:36.513
whatever it is,
please give it to them.

20:38.066 --> 20:40.200
I need my husband back.

20:40.202 --> 20:42.703
Our son needs his father back.

20:42.705 --> 20:45.322
I'll get him back.

20:45.324 --> 20:48.826
Thank you.

20:52.780 --> 20:54.548
DANNY:
Sarge.

20:54.550 --> 20:56.467
GORMLEY: You guys must
be running on fumes.

20:56.469 --> 20:57.701
What do you got
on the kidnappers?

20:57.703 --> 20:58.769
Well, Naduri's
girlfriend said

20:58.771 --> 20:59.970
they were knocking
off drugstores,

20:59.972 --> 21:01.338
so we went over
all the drugstores

21:01.340 --> 21:03.424
that were hit in the last
few weeks in the Bronx.

21:03.426 --> 21:05.059
We came up with one
on Tremont Avenue,

21:05.061 --> 21:06.293
where, in addition
to the drugs

21:06.295 --> 21:07.978
being stolen,
there was a credit card

21:07.980 --> 21:10.514
that was taken that the, uh,
owner kept in the cash register.

21:10.516 --> 21:12.149
And?
And we found a Con Ed

21:12.151 --> 21:13.434
bill that was paid for

21:13.436 --> 21:15.569
with that stolen card,
immediately after the robbery.

21:15.571 --> 21:17.438
Now, the bill's from an
apartment on Willis Ave.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.023
It could be where Sayid's
guys keep their drugs

21:19.025 --> 21:20.157
and their hostages.

21:20.159 --> 21:22.576
I'll call it into ESU
and kick it upstairs.

21:22.578 --> 21:25.612
You guys got three hours
and 47 minutes.

21:25.614 --> 21:26.646
Get going.

21:26.648 --> 21:28.482
We're going.

21:34.422 --> 21:35.873
(commander speaks quietly)

21:35.875 --> 21:36.957
Go.

21:51.773 --> 21:53.807
That's Bobby's jacket.

21:56.861 --> 21:58.395
It's all clear in here.

21:58.397 --> 22:00.147
Coming out.

22:05.453 --> 22:07.538
DANNY:
He's gone.

22:07.540 --> 22:09.022
He was here.

22:09.024 --> 22:12.543
Jamal must have
gave them a heads-up.

22:18.699 --> 22:21.001
Sayid's playing games.

22:21.003 --> 22:22.536
He's trying to get
us to negotiate.

22:22.538 --> 22:23.537
I suggest that...

22:23.539 --> 22:24.805
Excuse me.

22:24.807 --> 22:26.540
Those are my people
out there.

22:26.542 --> 22:28.809
I'm running this operation.

22:31.162 --> 22:32.763
Frank, another e-mail.

22:36.217 --> 22:38.385
GARRETT:
There's a link.

22:47.996 --> 22:49.613
(grunts)

22:52.951 --> 22:55.068
We don't know when
that was shot,

22:55.070 --> 22:57.921
or if he's
even still alive.

22:57.923 --> 22:58.956
Commissioner...

22:58.958 --> 23:02.960
Abdul has just landed at Rikers.

23:25.179 --> 23:27.064
Dad won't tell me
what's going on.

23:27.066 --> 23:28.198
Yeah, it's not good.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.616
That much I figured.

23:29.618 --> 23:31.568
So, this Abdul is the
key to everything?

23:31.570 --> 23:33.203
Maybe.

23:33.205 --> 23:34.705
So you're not going to tell
me anything, either?

23:34.707 --> 23:35.906
No. Can't.

23:35.908 --> 23:38.409
You do know that I'm
putting myself on the line,

23:38.411 --> 23:40.077
letting you take
this guy off campus.

23:40.079 --> 23:42.880
And the department
appreciates it, believe me.

23:42.882 --> 23:45.466
Here's the paperwork.

23:45.468 --> 23:47.301
He's good to go.

23:50.422 --> 23:52.139
I figured I might see
you again today...

23:52.141 --> 23:53.090
Shut up.

23:53.092 --> 23:54.758
Come on,
switch him out.

23:58.763 --> 24:00.180
Yeah, Dad.

24:00.182 --> 24:02.099
We got him.

24:02.101 --> 24:03.484
Roger that.

24:03.486 --> 24:06.437
Tell them we've
got Abdul Sayid,

24:06.439 --> 24:08.522
and ask for further
instructions.

24:21.068 --> 24:23.420
There's no response, sir.

24:29.427 --> 24:32.513
I like that
partner of yours.

24:32.515 --> 24:34.465
Yeah, he's okay.

24:34.467 --> 24:36.884
He faces the
situation head-on.

24:36.886 --> 24:38.886
Grabs the bull
by the horns.

24:38.888 --> 24:40.220
But I don't, right?

24:40.222 --> 24:42.306
What are you
talking about?

24:42.308 --> 24:44.525
How come you didn't back
me up out there today?

24:44.527 --> 24:47.093
Well, I just thought
that the situation

24:47.095 --> 24:49.763
required a more aggressive
approach, that's all.

24:49.765 --> 24:51.698
I mean, sometimes
you've got to do

24:51.700 --> 24:53.367
something more
than just talk.

24:54.736 --> 24:58.789
I've got almost 40 felony
collars since I came on the job.

24:58.791 --> 25:02.209
Not by arresting some pizza guy
fighting with his sister.

25:02.211 --> 25:03.443
But by using my head out there,

25:03.445 --> 25:05.129
using less force, not more.

25:05.964 --> 25:09.583
I see.

25:09.585 --> 25:11.635
Well, maybe we should
just forget about

25:11.637 --> 25:12.753
tomorrow's ride-along.

25:12.755 --> 25:14.671
No, we had a deal--
two tours.

25:14.673 --> 25:17.891
I'll try not to let
you down tomorrow.

25:20.812 --> 25:22.479
DANNY:
I don't get it.

25:22.481 --> 25:24.097
Two hours left
on the clock.

25:24.099 --> 25:26.150
What are the
Sayids waiting for?

25:26.152 --> 25:27.568
We pull this guy out
of the joint,

25:27.570 --> 25:30.187
now his brother's in no
rush to get him back?

25:30.189 --> 25:32.856
These guys like to play head games.
I know that.

25:32.858 --> 25:34.741
But unfortunately, we don't
know if Mulrow's still alive,

25:34.743 --> 25:36.360
and this son of a bitch
is sitting here

25:36.362 --> 25:38.144
like he owns the joint,
and our hands are tied.

25:38.146 --> 25:40.647
When I was
stationed in Kabul,

25:40.649 --> 25:43.534
local police had ways
to get guys like this talking.

25:44.318 --> 25:45.819
Meaning what?
Meaning sometimes

25:45.821 --> 25:47.454
you do what you have to do

25:47.456 --> 25:48.505
to get the
information you need.

25:48.507 --> 25:49.790
Okay, so what are
you saying, Sam?

25:49.792 --> 25:52.042
You want to get all medieval
on his ass? Is that it?

25:52.044 --> 25:53.677
(laughs)

25:53.679 --> 25:56.763
To get Bobby Mulrow back to
his wife and kid, yeah.

25:56.765 --> 25:57.831
Yeah, wouldn't you?

25:57.833 --> 25:59.049
Come on, I'd get medieval

25:59.051 --> 26:00.717
on a scumbag like this
just for kicks.

26:00.719 --> 26:02.302
We're not calling
the shots here.

26:02.304 --> 26:03.887
The commissioner is,
so until then,

26:03.889 --> 26:05.973
we act polite.

26:05.975 --> 26:07.474
(Sam sighs)

26:09.027 --> 26:10.861
Hey, Detective!

26:10.863 --> 26:12.279
Perfect timing.

26:12.281 --> 26:14.147
I'd love another soda.
Yeah,

26:14.149 --> 26:15.949
and I'd love to ram
that can down your throat.

26:15.951 --> 26:18.151
No, you still need me.

26:18.153 --> 26:19.703
Really?

26:19.705 --> 26:21.705
How do you know we haven't
found Detective Mulrow?

26:21.707 --> 26:25.242
Because I'd be heading for a
prison cell upstate, if you had.

26:26.711 --> 26:29.362
Do you have a point,
Detective?

26:29.364 --> 26:30.380
Yeah, I got a point.

26:30.382 --> 26:32.165
You could still do
yourself some good.

26:32.167 --> 26:33.634
You help us find
Detective Mulrow,

26:33.636 --> 26:35.886
a good attorney will
get you time served.

26:36.754 --> 26:38.538
You remind me of my brother.

26:38.540 --> 26:40.206
So stubborn.

26:40.208 --> 26:43.477
(clears throat)

26:43.479 --> 26:45.395
I am stubborn.

26:45.397 --> 26:48.048
But I'm nothing like that
punk brother of yours, okay?

26:48.050 --> 26:51.101
And I promise you, if anything
happens to that detective,

26:51.103 --> 26:54.271
I will make it my life's mission
to put a bullet in your head.

26:55.273 --> 26:57.491
Good talking to you,
Detective.

26:58.409 --> 27:00.527
Good talking to you, too.

27:00.529 --> 27:03.113
Oh, Detective.

27:03.115 --> 27:05.899
Don't forget my drinkie.

27:15.009 --> 27:18.411
What time is it?

27:18.413 --> 27:22.766
We got one hour,
25 minutes.

27:22.768 --> 27:25.018
Why haven't they
sent instructions?

27:25.020 --> 27:27.638
I'm praying it's not because
their bargaining chip

27:27.640 --> 27:28.972
is no longer breathing.

27:28.974 --> 27:30.557
Commissioner.

27:30.559 --> 27:32.142
Yes, Baker.

27:32.144 --> 27:33.860
Officer Reynolds
is here.

27:37.865 --> 27:40.266
Tell me something good.

27:40.268 --> 27:42.202
The Agency just received
word from Kuala Lumpur.

27:42.204 --> 27:43.737
Omar Sayid died
20 minutes ago

27:43.739 --> 27:46.773
in a firefight with
Malaysian special forces.

27:49.160 --> 27:52.296
I wasn't aware the Malaysian
government was involved

27:52.298 --> 27:53.997
in this operation.

27:53.999 --> 27:55.949
The Agency has an obligation
to alert local authorities

27:55.951 --> 27:57.801
when we pursue one
of their citizens.

27:57.803 --> 27:59.953
What they do with
that information

27:59.955 --> 28:01.621
is out of our hands.
So, they found him

28:01.623 --> 28:02.723
and took him out.

28:02.725 --> 28:04.174
Yes.

28:04.176 --> 28:07.894
Had you alerted them about
the threat to my officer?

28:07.896 --> 28:09.146
Apparently, they
located his headquarters

28:09.148 --> 28:11.982
and they went in without
contacting the director.

28:13.101 --> 28:16.503
I'm sorry,
Commissioner.

28:16.505 --> 28:18.021
You come here demanding
my cooperation,

28:18.023 --> 28:20.824
but you don't have the decency
to keep me informed.

28:24.946 --> 28:27.447
Your work here is done.

28:42.096 --> 28:44.214
(cell phone ringing)

28:44.216 --> 28:45.432
Yeah, what do you got, Dad?

28:45.434 --> 28:48.969
Omar Sayid was
killed in Malaysia.

28:48.971 --> 28:50.937
Is it possible that any
of his men here know yet?

28:50.939 --> 28:54.107
'Cause as soon as they
find out, Bobby's a dead man.

28:54.109 --> 28:56.342
We need his brother to
tell us what he knows.

28:56.344 --> 28:58.395
Okay.

29:00.148 --> 29:02.866
Whatever it takes.

29:26.717 --> 29:28.702
Hold him.

29:28.704 --> 29:29.719
ABDUL:
White bread.

29:29.721 --> 29:31.521
How's the
weather up there?

29:38.762 --> 29:40.664
ABDUL: Hey, what's
the hood for?

29:40.666 --> 29:42.532
Wait, what the hell are you doing?!
Come on.

29:42.534 --> 29:43.984
(Abdul grunts)

29:43.986 --> 29:45.902
Get your ass in there
and shut up.

29:45.904 --> 29:47.621
ABDUL: Hey! Hey!
Don't worry,

29:47.623 --> 29:48.738
there's
a pillow in there.

29:48.740 --> 29:50.607
It's nice and cozy.

30:02.453 --> 30:04.787
Keep an eye out.

30:06.557 --> 30:09.392
All right,
on your feet.

30:09.394 --> 30:12.846
There we go...
come on...

30:12.848 --> 30:13.980
On your knees.

30:13.982 --> 30:15.732
Right there.

30:15.734 --> 30:17.484
ABDUL: Where are we?
Right at the end

30:17.486 --> 30:18.685
of the line for you.

30:18.687 --> 30:19.802
You got something we want,

30:19.804 --> 30:21.488
and you're going to
give it to us now.

30:21.490 --> 30:24.441
You can't do anything to me,
and you know it.

30:24.443 --> 30:27.143
Maybe so,
but they can.

30:29.830 --> 30:31.698
What is this?

30:31.700 --> 30:32.866
Who are they?

30:32.868 --> 30:33.917
Well, can't you tell?

30:33.919 --> 30:35.418
Those are Malaysian
special forces.

30:35.420 --> 30:37.837
Yeah, apparently they're
pretty pissed off at you

30:37.839 --> 30:39.656
for coming over here
and getting locked up.

30:39.658 --> 30:41.591
You did a lot of
bad things over there

30:41.593 --> 30:43.710
you never answered for--
drugs, kidnapping, murder.

30:43.712 --> 30:44.827
You can't do this.

30:44.829 --> 30:46.829
We can't? Sure, we can.

30:46.831 --> 30:48.831
They got a private jet
fueled up and ready to go.

30:48.833 --> 30:50.934
Teterboro to Malaysia,
one-way trip.

30:50.936 --> 30:52.269
Special, just for you.

30:52.271 --> 30:53.803
Don't they give the
death penalty

30:53.805 --> 30:55.272
over there for
drug trafficking?

30:55.274 --> 30:56.640
Yeah, but I'd be surprised
if he survives

30:56.642 --> 30:57.857
the trip over there
with those guys.

30:57.859 --> 30:59.676
You can't send me back
without a hearing.

30:59.678 --> 31:00.843
I know my rights.
Hey!

31:00.845 --> 31:02.345
You don't have any rights.

31:02.347 --> 31:03.980
But you got a choice.

31:03.982 --> 31:05.699
You can tell us where we can
find Detective Mulrow,

31:05.701 --> 31:07.284
or you can hop
on a plane

31:07.286 --> 31:09.736
with them guys...
and you can die.

31:09.738 --> 31:12.706
My brother will protect me.

31:12.708 --> 31:14.124
Oh, your brother. Okay.

31:14.126 --> 31:15.959
Tell him about
his brother, Sam.

31:17.828 --> 31:19.462
Your brother's dead.

31:29.674 --> 31:30.924
You're lying.

31:30.926 --> 31:33.393
No. Don't think you're
going to be seeing him

31:33.395 --> 31:36.059
at any Sayid family
reunions any time soon.

31:36.084 --> 31:36.681
Wait!

31:36.682 --> 31:37.880
DANNY: Shut up.
We've waited long enough.

31:37.882 --> 31:38.982
Stop!

31:38.984 --> 31:40.734
What?! What?

31:40.736 --> 31:42.268
Charlotte Avenue.

31:42.270 --> 31:44.053
149th.

31:44.055 --> 31:46.022
A warehouse basement.

31:46.024 --> 31:46.990
You got that?

31:46.992 --> 31:48.274
I got it.
Good. Let's go.

31:48.276 --> 31:49.559
Wait, we had a deal!

31:49.561 --> 31:51.611
No, we don't negotiate with terrorists.
Please!

31:51.613 --> 31:53.229
You can't leave
me with them!

31:53.231 --> 31:54.564
They'll kill me!
Relax.

31:54.566 --> 31:56.950
It's Detective
Nagra and Singh.

31:56.952 --> 31:58.251
Brooklyn Vice.

31:58.253 --> 32:00.453
They're going to keep
you company for a while

32:00.455 --> 32:01.788
while we go find
Detective Mulrow.

32:01.790 --> 32:04.007
Oh, and I hope, for your
sake, he's still breathing.

32:04.009 --> 32:06.209
Be nice, maybe they'll
give you a drinkie.

32:09.130 --> 32:11.014
We got an address,
Commissioner.

32:11.016 --> 32:12.549
We're on our way.

32:18.422 --> 32:19.606
Ready.

32:20.474 --> 32:22.025
On your order, sir.

32:27.398 --> 32:28.732
Go.

32:54.058 --> 32:56.142
(screams)

33:06.654 --> 33:07.637
Bobby!

33:07.639 --> 33:09.639
Bobby Mulrow!

33:09.641 --> 33:13.743
(officers shouting orders
in distance)

33:13.745 --> 33:15.578
SAM:
I'll take this.

33:15.580 --> 33:17.080
All right.

33:39.553 --> 33:42.305
OFFICER (in distance):
Shots fired! Shots fired!

33:42.307 --> 33:43.940
(distant):
Move in! Move in!

33:43.942 --> 33:45.442
Move, move, move!

33:48.479 --> 33:51.681
Bobby!

34:00.541 --> 34:02.041
I got him!

34:02.043 --> 34:04.461
OFFICER (on radio):
We found him.

34:04.463 --> 34:05.545
Is he alive?

34:05.547 --> 34:07.330
OFFICER:
Confirming status now.

34:07.332 --> 34:08.882
Hey, hey.

34:08.884 --> 34:09.998
Bobby.

34:10.001 --> 34:11.868
Hey, hey.
It's okay, it's okay.

34:11.870 --> 34:13.136
Bobby, it's Danny.

34:13.138 --> 34:14.304
It's Danny Reagan.

34:14.306 --> 34:15.304
Danny.

34:15.306 --> 34:17.056
What the hell took
you so long, man?

34:17.058 --> 34:19.309
We wanted you, we wanted
you back, kid.

34:19.311 --> 34:20.844
In here!

34:20.846 --> 34:24.013
OFFICER:
Subject is alive, sir.

34:25.683 --> 34:28.851
I repeat, Mulrow is alive.

34:32.656 --> 34:34.190
You're going to be all right.

34:34.192 --> 34:36.909
I got you.
Yeah.

34:36.911 --> 34:38.077
It's going to
be all right, kid.

34:38.079 --> 34:39.829
Let's get a bus!
Come on!

34:39.831 --> 34:42.581
Nice work, guys.

34:43.900 --> 34:46.335
Get some sleep.

34:55.212 --> 34:57.130
Hell of a close call.

34:57.132 --> 35:00.700
I'm getting too old for all-nighters.
Unless there's a...

35:00.702 --> 35:02.802
beautiful woman involved.

35:02.804 --> 35:05.939
Each year,
that becomes a closer call.

35:10.060 --> 35:11.761
Good job, boss.

35:16.901 --> 35:18.234
So...

35:18.236 --> 35:19.819
So what?

35:19.821 --> 35:22.939
If they didn't take out Omar,

35:22.941 --> 35:25.992
and it came down to trading
their guy for our guy...

35:25.994 --> 35:28.895
We don't negotiate
with terrorists.

35:28.897 --> 35:30.446
On paper, no.

35:30.448 --> 35:32.165
But you don't play
the game on paper.

35:32.167 --> 35:34.133
Very often,

35:34.135 --> 35:39.055
this job comes down to choosing
between two lousy options.

35:39.057 --> 35:43.243
Pick your poison,
live with the consequences.

35:43.245 --> 35:47.296
So I'm not going to
get a straight answer.

35:53.303 --> 35:55.137
JOE: You broke my window!
Are you out of your mind?

35:55.139 --> 35:57.156
What's wrong with you?
ANTONIA: Look what you did to my truck!

35:57.158 --> 35:59.442
I didn't do that to
the truck! Are you nuts?

35:59.444 --> 36:00.960
Are you crazy?
Some of your guys did it to my truck.

36:00.962 --> 36:02.412
Are you kidding me?
Look what you did to my truck!

36:02.414 --> 36:03.696
You know what?!
Which of you guys did this...?

36:03.698 --> 36:05.415
I don't care!
Look at that!

36:05.417 --> 36:07.840
How did these two get
back on the street so fast?

36:07.865 --> 36:08.485
Kind of hard to

36:08.486 --> 36:10.152
hold them when they
haven't really

36:10.154 --> 36:11.120
done anything wrong.

36:11.122 --> 36:12.488
This time,
let's try it my way.

36:12.490 --> 36:15.091
I will do it, too!
Hey, both of you! Both of you shut up!

36:15.093 --> 36:16.092
Break it up.

36:16.094 --> 36:17.427
Hey! Hey, break it up!

36:17.429 --> 36:18.378
Enough!

36:18.380 --> 36:19.629
I'll kill you!

36:19.631 --> 36:20.997
Give me this.

36:20.999 --> 36:21.965
Everyone else, beat it.

36:21.967 --> 36:23.299
Come on, get out of here.

36:23.301 --> 36:24.834
(crowbar clanks onto sidewalk)

36:24.836 --> 36:27.053
You fired her because she wanted
to change your menu, right?

36:27.055 --> 36:29.422
Customer's don't want
to eat this crap.

36:29.424 --> 36:31.724
The gourmet cheese and
"glutton-free"... whatever.

36:31.726 --> 36:34.010
All right, only every
time I drive by,

36:34.012 --> 36:35.111
she's got a line.

36:35.113 --> 36:36.779
And your business
is down, right?

36:36.781 --> 36:37.847
Yeah, 25%.

36:37.849 --> 36:39.565
And counting.
All right, all right.

36:39.567 --> 36:41.367
But you can only
sell so much pizza

36:41.369 --> 36:42.869
off this truck,
right, Antonia?

36:43.988 --> 36:45.905
Right?

36:45.907 --> 36:47.624
Eventually, I'll
need a real kitchen.

36:47.626 --> 36:49.542
So, why don't you add
her menu to yours?

36:49.544 --> 36:51.244
You got regular pizza,
you got your hipster stuff,

36:51.246 --> 36:53.579
all your bases are covered,
you make a fortune.

36:53.581 --> 36:55.999
If you two can bury the hatchet.

36:56.001 --> 36:57.667
You're brother and sister,
damn it.

36:57.669 --> 36:59.669
You, fix the truck.

36:59.671 --> 37:01.004
You, pay for the window.

37:01.006 --> 37:03.056
Come on, this place has been
a part of the neighborhood

37:03.058 --> 37:04.757
and your family for 50 years.

37:04.759 --> 37:07.176
To keep it going is
going to be on you guys.

37:07.178 --> 37:08.511
I gotta come back here again,

37:08.513 --> 37:10.313
you're not getting out
of jail in an hour,

37:10.315 --> 37:11.931
I can promise
you that.

37:11.933 --> 37:13.016
Okay?

37:13.018 --> 37:16.052
(clears throat)
Yeah, we'll try.

37:19.406 --> 37:21.908
I like the way you
handled that one, kiddo.

37:21.910 --> 37:23.109
So, all of a sudden,

37:23.111 --> 37:24.277
I'm a good cop?

37:24.279 --> 37:25.995
Come on, I never
said you weren't.

37:25.997 --> 37:28.614
I'm just not as good
as my partner, right?

37:28.616 --> 37:31.501
Look, Jamie, I know I talk
a lot about my time on the job,

37:31.503 --> 37:33.736
but that's because,
at my age,

37:33.738 --> 37:35.788
the mouth's about the
only thing that still works.

37:35.790 --> 37:38.758
We finally agree on
something, I guess.

37:38.760 --> 37:39.909
Ooh...

37:39.911 --> 37:42.595
Watch your mouth, kid.

37:42.597 --> 37:44.013
(chuckles)

37:46.884 --> 37:48.851
(laughter)

37:48.853 --> 37:50.470
This is the best Sunday
dinner in a while.

37:50.472 --> 37:52.355
For sure.

37:52.357 --> 37:53.589
By far.

37:54.892 --> 37:56.559
Thanks a lot, gee-gees.

37:56.561 --> 37:58.394
No offense, Pops.

37:58.396 --> 37:59.979
You can thank Uncle Jamie.

37:59.981 --> 38:01.781
He talked the
Salducci kids

38:01.783 --> 38:04.283
down out of their family feud.

38:04.285 --> 38:05.451
All in a day's work.

38:05.453 --> 38:07.487
You should really try
this mu shu pork calzone.

38:07.489 --> 38:08.571
It's amazing.

38:08.573 --> 38:10.707
That's a little
chef-y for my tastes.

38:10.709 --> 38:11.874
Chef-y?

38:11.876 --> 38:12.909
Fooling with food

38:12.911 --> 38:15.044
that doesn't need fooling with.

38:15.046 --> 38:18.164
Yeah, I-I don't like that
newfangled stuff.

38:18.166 --> 38:19.332
You can't beat good old
tomato and cheese.

38:19.334 --> 38:20.583
HENRY:
Francis,

38:20.585 --> 38:23.302
do you remember old Carmine
Salducci and his wife?

38:23.304 --> 38:24.286
Sure.

38:24.288 --> 38:26.288
I also remember
paying for my pizza.

38:26.290 --> 38:27.890
Well, I paid for
all this stuff.

38:27.892 --> 38:29.475
Full price?

38:29.477 --> 38:32.261
They tried to give me
a discount, but I said, "No."

38:32.263 --> 38:33.513
That must have hurt.

38:33.515 --> 38:34.847
(chuckling, laughter)

38:34.849 --> 38:37.400
NICKY: I added
it all up.

38:37.402 --> 38:39.318
All the people at
this table together,

38:39.320 --> 38:41.571
115 years on the job.

38:41.573 --> 38:42.572
Hey, hey!

38:42.574 --> 38:44.190
Wow.
(whistles)

38:44.192 --> 38:45.992
Just when I didn't think
I could feel any older.

38:45.994 --> 38:47.977
(laughter)
Thanks again.

38:47.979 --> 38:49.996
Don't worry, Gramps.
You wear it well.

38:51.148 --> 38:52.949
I want to be a fireman.

38:52.951 --> 38:55.151
What? What?
You want to...?

38:56.336 --> 38:58.287
You want...?
What?

38:58.289 --> 38:59.956
Their uniforms are cool.

39:02.092 --> 39:03.843
I'm going to
start to clear.

39:03.845 --> 39:05.661
JACK: I'll help.
I will help.

39:05.663 --> 39:07.847
I'll help. Me, too.
FRANK: Good idea.

39:07.849 --> 39:08.998
NICKY:
Me, too.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.300
Here you go.
HENRY: What's this?

39:11.302 --> 39:12.802
Volunteering to
clear the table?

39:12.804 --> 39:14.470
We should have
pizza every Sunday.

39:14.472 --> 39:16.105
So.

39:16.107 --> 39:17.774
A fireman, huh?

39:17.776 --> 39:19.008
Interesting.

39:19.010 --> 39:20.476
Yeah, you know
anything about this?

39:20.478 --> 39:22.195
Eh, could be worse.

39:22.197 --> 39:24.647
He could have said he wanted
to be an ACLU lawyer.

39:24.649 --> 39:26.732
(chortles)

39:26.734 --> 39:28.818
Still.

39:28.820 --> 39:30.186
Don't worry, I'll
straighten him out.

39:32.355 --> 39:34.657
ALL:
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow

39:34.659 --> 39:37.043
♪ For he's a jolly
good fellow ♪

39:37.045 --> 39:41.030
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow

39:41.032 --> 39:44.333
♪ Which nobody can deny.

39:44.335 --> 39:46.169
Sons of guns, sneak attack.

39:46.171 --> 39:48.037
Here, kids, help me blow
out these candles.

39:50.090 --> 39:51.874
ALL:
Yay!

39:51.876 --> 39:53.426
(applause)

39:53.428 --> 39:55.645
FRANK:
Hey, hey.

39:55.647 --> 39:57.096
60 years a cop.

39:57.098 --> 39:58.064
To Henry Reagan.

39:58.066 --> 39:59.649
Top cop at the table.

39:59.651 --> 40:00.983
ALL:
Hear, hear.

40:00.985 --> 40:02.101
Thank you.

40:02.103 --> 40:04.070
I'll get the plates.

40:04.072 --> 40:06.572
This looks awesome.

40:06.574 --> 40:07.940
I'm ready.
I'll get a knife.

40:09.943 --> 40:11.110
I'll put it out now.
