Can you see my ass through this?

00:22.720 --> 00:25.598
One of these nights you're gonna realize it.

00:25.920 --> 00:29.595
I'm the guy for you, Brooke Davis.
You'll see.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.950
I wanted you to fight for me.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.714
- How was I supposed to know that?
- You just are.

00:42.800 --> 00:43.869
I have cancer.

You tell Haley that song was a hit.

01:11.080 --> 01:13.036
What, what?

01:17.760 --> 01:18.829
How are things with Nathan?

<i>If you think I'm gonna let you</i>

01:21.760 --> 01:24.035
'Cause if you do, I'm gonna hurt you.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.554
The roots are still there. It just takes time.

01:26.640 --> 01:29.871
- Stay with me tonight.
- I was hoping you would say that.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.869
Yummy.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.918
I think you're in the wrong store.
You're looking for Slut Barn.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.397
So, you two bury the hatchet yet?

01:38.480 --> 01:40.710
Funny thing.
I'm about to bury it in her throat.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.429
If I wanted to watch cheerleaders wrestle,
I'd turn on pay-per-view.

01:44.520 --> 01:45.635
Nice.

01:47.520 --> 01:48.999
This kind of turns me on.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.753
Fantasy boy draft.

01:51.840 --> 01:53.478
- I pick Lucas.
- I pick Nathan.

01:53.560 --> 01:54.629
- I get Skills.
- Wait!

01:54.720 --> 01:57.598
If you tell Whitey I have a heart condition,
I'm off the team.

01:57.680 --> 02:00.114
Yeah, and if I don't tell Whitey
about your heart condition,

02:00.200 --> 02:02.031
<i>you're off the planet.</i>

02:02.680 --> 02:03.715
I love you.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.074
I still do love you.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.275
I love you.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.998
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

03:43.720 --> 03:44.914
Hello?

03:46.600 --> 03:48.192
Where are you?

03:49.760 --> 03:51.159
Okay. Okay.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.234
Hello.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.839
Yeah, no problem. I'll be right over.

04:08.920 --> 04:12.230
I'm sorry, Brooke. It was Peyton.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.548
Peyton?

04:13.680 --> 04:17.639
As in "my best friend
and your ex-girlfriend" Peyton?

04:21.200 --> 04:24.431
Something's up.
But we're together now, right?

04:24.520 --> 04:25.919
You and me.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.156
Means everything to me.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.676
We just have to trust each other this time.

04:32.680 --> 04:36.195
Yeah, I know. You're right.
Besides, I have things to do today.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.553
It's pretty exciting, actually.

04:38.640 --> 04:41.757
Mouth set up a website for me
so I can sell my new clothing line,

04:41.840 --> 04:43.592
and it goes live in about an hour.

04:43.680 --> 04:47.195
So I figure I should make some dresses
in case anyone wants to buy one.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.551
That's really great. I'm proud of you.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.839
- Okay, see you in a little bit.
- Okay.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.152
See you later, boyfriend.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.318
- What?
- Nothing.

05:06.960 --> 05:10.316
Just feels good
to hear you call me boyfriend.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.471
Feels good to say it.

05:30.280 --> 05:32.748
And we are live.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.149
Nice.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.315
Hi.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.953
Well, well.

06:01.680 --> 06:04.353
- Where's the better half?
- I don't know.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.472
He always was
the "love them and leave them" type.

06:09.560 --> 06:10.595
Can I help you with something?

06:10.680 --> 06:13.240
As far as I know, this house
doesn't even belong to you anymore.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.356
Trust me, little girl,
this house and everything in it

06:15.440 --> 06:17.032
will always belong to me.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.794
Mr. Scott, can you please leave?
You're really creeping me out.

06:22.880 --> 06:26.350
You know, at least Peyton was pleasant
in the morning.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.159
Oh, by the way, I'm still waiting
on those annulment papers.

06:33.240 --> 06:36.232
I hope you don't think
a one-night stand's gonna change that.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.195
Hey.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.469
Looks like somebody slept in his clothes
last night.

06:52.560 --> 06:55.028
Yeah, it's a long story.

06:55.480 --> 06:59.359
- So what's going on?
- Look, I hate to ask, okay?

06:59.440 --> 07:01.510
But over the summer you kind of promised

07:01.600 --> 07:04.956
that if I ever wanted to go find Ellie
you would come with me.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.393
Yeah, I remember. Did you find her?

07:11.440 --> 07:14.318
- And I think I want to go see her.
- Today?

07:15.040 --> 07:16.109
Right now, actually.

07:16.200 --> 07:19.158
'Cause if I don't go,
I never will, and I need to.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.473
Will you go?

07:24.040 --> 07:27.077
Sure. A promise is a promise.

07:34.720 --> 07:35.914
Hello?

07:37.240 --> 07:41.028
- Hey. I'm on my way.
- Okay, good. I can give you directions.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.319
Okay, where am I going?

07:50.560 --> 07:52.198
Where were you last night?

07:53.920 --> 07:54.989
To be continued.

07:55.080 --> 07:56.877
Mouth, you didn't exactly break
any speed records

07:56.960 --> 07:57.995
driving over here, you know?

07:58.080 --> 08:01.595
You called me 17 minutes ago,
and I drive a bicycle, Brooke.

08:01.680 --> 08:02.715
Well, I'm fresh out of medals.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.712
Just please come here, because I need you
to fix this stupid website.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.950
- It was supposed to go live an hour ago.
- Oh, it's live.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.076
- So what's the problem?
- Click on "orders."

08:11.080 --> 08:13.036
Thirty-four orders? Brooke, this is great.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.509
Hold the enthusiasm. Click it again.

08:16.200 --> 08:19.715
- Make that 36 orders.
- Brooke, 36 orders is incredible.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.791
Haley, I can't make 36 dresses that fast.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.269
- I can't make six dresses that fast.
- Wait.

08:24.360 --> 08:26.191
- What did you think was gonna happen?
- I don't know.

08:26.280 --> 08:27.872
I didn't think people were actually gonna
order anything.

08:27.960 --> 08:30.110
And if they did, I figured they'd just order
stuff I'd already made.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.839
- I mean, is that a bad plan?
- 37, 38.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.399
Dude, it just jumped to 43.

08:35.480 --> 08:36.913
Mouth, I did not ask you
to come over here

08:37.000 --> 08:39.195
to showcase your counting skills.
I need you to make it stop.

08:39.280 --> 08:42.238
Kill it. Do whatever you have to do.
I don't have 43 dresses.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.073
- How many do you have?
- Four.

08:52.440 --> 08:55.716
- So where are we headed?
- River City. You ever been there?

08:57.520 --> 09:01.229
- No, but it's on my list.
- So, how about that long story?

09:02.880 --> 09:06.668
- I spent the night with Brooke.
- Okay. Never mind.

09:06.760 --> 09:10.833
Well, it wasn't like that.
I mean, we didn't actually sleep together.

09:10.920 --> 09:14.879
I'd have thought you decided not to play
her non-exclusive sleeping game.

09:14.960 --> 09:17.076
We're together now. Exclusively.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.674
Oh, no. Oh, God, I am an idiot.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.597
No, you know what? Scratch that.
You're an idiot.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.875
- I didn't know any better.
- What are you talking about?

09:25.960 --> 09:28.918
Lucas, you guys have been together,
what, just like a couple of hours?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.150
And you're in the car with me?
Why didn't you tell me?

09:31.240 --> 09:35.597
- I wouldn't have even asked you to come.
- Peyton, I made you a promise.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.073
Besides, you should be able
to turn to me for help.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.798
I love being that guy for you.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.474
Well, does Brooke love you being
that guy for me?

09:44.760 --> 09:47.115
No, I didn't think so. Okay, so call her.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.033
Call her and tell her we had plans.
Right now.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.678
Dial the phone.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.716
I got it.

10:00.280 --> 10:03.431
Thank God it is you. Please tell me
you are on your way over here.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.193
Well, actually, I was just checking in
to see how things are going.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.589
Like crap. Are you still with Peyton?

10:11.240 --> 10:14.915
Yeah, listen, I sort of promised her
I'd go with her to see Ellie.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.877
We're heading out of town right now.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.951
- How long are you gonna be gone?
- I don't know.

10:20.040 --> 10:23.476
- But I'll call you when I do.
- Okay.

10:23.560 --> 10:26.154
- Look, Brooke, I made her a promise.
- Luke, it's fine.

10:26.240 --> 10:30.677
We're trusting each other, right?
So just call me later, okay?

10:31.400 --> 10:33.118
<i>- See you.</i>
- Okay.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.391
See? She's fine with it.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.757
Hey, was that Lucas? Is he coming over?

10:43.840 --> 10:47.150
- 'Cause we need all the help we can get.
- No, he's with his other girlfriend.

11:02.360 --> 11:03.759
This is it.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.910
- You okay?
- Yeah.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.675
- I guess I just didn't think I'd be this afraid.
- Of what?

11:12.960 --> 11:15.315
I don't know. Like, the truth maybe?

11:18.040 --> 11:20.679
I think this is probably something
I should do alone.

11:19.320 --> 11:20.435
Okay.

11:22.320 --> 11:25.118
Look, I'm really sorry
that you rode out all this way.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.238
I guess I just needed your help
getting here.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.753
You never needed my help.

11:35.200 --> 11:39.671
Anyway, I'm gonna go explore a bit.
Just give me a call when you're ready.

11:38.720 --> 11:41.359
My name is Elizabeth. I'm your mother.

11:43.760 --> 11:46.069
Peyton, good luck.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.079
Thanks, Luke.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.553
Just get out, Ellie.

12:14.960 --> 12:18.077
Out of my house, out of my town,
and out of my life.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.435
Hi.

12:24.960 --> 12:28.157
Okay, Mom, this is pretty weird.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.430
You leave me a note
and sneak away in the middle of the night

12:31.600 --> 12:34.034
and then I get this cryptic phone call.
What's going on?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.751
- You know how much I love you.
- Mom...

12:36.440 --> 12:38.271
Honey, sit down.

12:38.360 --> 12:39.475
Okay.

12:43.440 --> 12:47.319
Over the years since I met your father,
I've changed.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.677
And somewhere along the line,
I've become someone I don't respect.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.790
Pack a bag and get out.
Or so help me God,

12:56.840 --> 12:58.319
I will stab you in your sleep.

12:59.160 --> 13:02.436
- I'm boiling water to throw on you.
- And what's the syrup for?

13:00.720 --> 13:01.869
Oh, that's so it sticks to you.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.230
- Mom, what are you...
- Let me finish.

13:05.680 --> 13:09.468
As far back as I can remember,
I've had to rely on others.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.115
I've never been able to be alone.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.271
I've never been very strong.

13:17.400 --> 13:20.995
But now it's time for me to try. I have to.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.031
I'm not going back to Tree Hill, Nathan.

13:28.320 --> 13:32.313
This is my world, okay? That's my music.
This is my art.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.430
Just stay out of my life, okay?

13:49.440 --> 13:51.635
That was their first single.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.071
Only a few thousand of those exist.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.551
I'm sorry. Your front door was unlocked.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.435
Hey.

14:02.080 --> 14:05.789
If I'm allowed to go into your room and
sneak around, you can do the same here.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.238
Oh, wait.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.110
I wasn't allowed to do that, was I?

14:10.120 --> 14:11.838
What are you doing here, Peyton?

14:14.560 --> 14:16.835
Well, I mean, I tried to see you

14:17.360 --> 14:19.669
and I went to your hotel room
the night you left,

14:19.720 --> 14:21.438
but you were gone.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.554
I don't know. I didn't know how to
find you, and I started to think

14:24.160 --> 14:26.196
maybe you didn't want to be found.

14:26.680 --> 14:29.035
But that doesn't really answer
my question.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.559
What are you doing here?

14:34.880 --> 14:38.316
I have a business proposition
for you, actually.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.758
I have this friend, right?
And she's a musician, and she's good.

14:40.840 --> 14:44.230
She's really good,
and I want to put out a record.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.632
I just... I don't know how.

14:47.360 --> 14:50.636
So I was thinking
maybe you could help me.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.156
It's good to see you, Peyton.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.548
"The mockery made him an outsider,

15:19.640 --> 15:22.950
"and feeling an outsider
made him behave like one."

15:22.200 --> 15:23.633
I think that's my book.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.839
- How you doing, Faith?
- My God, Lucas.

15:29.240 --> 15:32.232
- It's been, like, a long time.
- Too long.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.028
Wait a minute. What are you doing here?
How did you find me?

15:35.640 --> 15:39.349
Faith, if you still lived in Tree Hill,
there's only one place you'd be.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.919
The only difference
between there and here is, well,

15:42.000 --> 15:43.991
our court's got a river that runs next to it.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.872
Okay, your mom told me where you were,
but I would have found you eventually.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.189
My mom always did have a soft spot
for you.

15:50.040 --> 15:53.191
So, how's life as a big-shot
Raven superstar?

15:53.200 --> 15:54.269
Here we go.

15:56.440 --> 15:58.874
Next thing you'll tell me
you're dating some bitchy cheerleader.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.353
Move your ass, Haley.
You are not setting a very good example.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.036
And I noticed you weren't paying
much attention during my tutorial.

16:04.760 --> 16:08.639
- I know how to sew, Brooke.
- Come on, get the lead out, girls.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.393
These dresses are not gonna
sew themselves

16:10.920 --> 16:13.195
and where the hell is Mouth
with my extra fabric?

16:12.440 --> 16:15.637
- Are you okay? You seem a little edgy.
- I am just focused.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.358
Are you sure
this doesn't have anything to do

16:18.080 --> 16:19.274
with Lucas going off with Peyton?

16:19.720 --> 16:22.029
No. It's not like they went off
on tour together.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.319
And besides, it's different this time.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.630
- It is different, right?
- Yes.

16:25.120 --> 16:28.396
- Bevin, you're late, and what are those?
- Cookies.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.357
Not those. Those little people thingies.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.990
This is my brother Tommy, my sister Tara,
and my nieces Jodi and Kate.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.394
I promised I'd baby-sit them today.
Aren't they cute?

16:38.480 --> 16:39.674
And what the hell is she doing here?

16:41.840 --> 16:43.637
Oh, I called her.
You said to round up the squad.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.759
I didn't mean Rachel.
You missed the tutorial.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.719
- I missed the tutorial.
- I think I can wing it.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.637
These dresses look pretty simple.

16:50.640 --> 16:53.029
- Simple?
- Brooke, it's actually a really good idea.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.238
We need all the help we can get.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.399
Haley, you're a genius.

16:58.200 --> 17:03.035
Hey, kids, do you like to play dress-up?
I bet you do. This is Tutorial Girl.

16:59.960 --> 17:02.633
She's gonna teach you guys
how to make dress-up.

17:04.880 --> 17:08.190
- Sound like fun?
- Brooke, this doesn't seem terribly right.

17:07.640 --> 17:10.029
Haley, you said it yourself.
We need all the help we can get.

17:11.040 --> 17:15.238
Come on. Here we go. We'll go this way.
Oh, this is gonna be so fun.

17:13.520 --> 17:16.592
I don't get it. You finally got your divorce.
That's what you wanted, Mom.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.550
- Why don't you just come home?
- I can't.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.359
Mom, I can't just drop everything
and move away.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.473
I know, and that's why I'm not asking you
to come with me.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.839
You have a wife, Nathan.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.395
And whatever it is the two of you
are going through right now,

17:34.680 --> 17:36.033
that still means something.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.793
I don't want you to make
the same mistakes I did.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.630
- Housekeeping.
- I'm fine.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.791
Mom, why are you so spooked?

17:45.600 --> 17:47.556
I'm so sorry, Nathan.

17:51.080 --> 17:52.229
I am.

17:54.080 --> 17:57.550
But the fire at the dealership,
it wasn't an accident.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.674
We were going to get out, remember?

18:03.920 --> 18:05.990
But your father wouldn't have that.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.073
It was me.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.478
I tried to kill him.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.036
I was so miserable that day
because of your father.

18:21.840 --> 18:25.799
<i>I hadn't been out of rehab long,</i>
<i>and it had been a difficult day.</i>

18:25.800 --> 18:29.679
<i>I had to find some strength,</i>
<i>some courage to find a way out</i>

18:30.560 --> 18:32.357
<i>and that's when I found one.</i>

18:34.560 --> 18:36.516
<i>There were just four things left to do.</i>

18:48.560 --> 18:50.994
<i>The first was to type the card.</i>

18:51.680 --> 18:54.911
<i>The second was to deliver it.</i>

18:54.200 --> 18:56.919
<i>The third was to light it.</i>

19:07.440 --> 19:10.557
The fourth was to ask God

19:19.200 --> 19:21.998
to take me far away
from this person I'd become.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.392
I'm sorry, Nathan.
I did it for both of us, to free us.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.711
- No.
- Please, Nathan, wait.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.518
No. You didn't have the courage
to leave him,

19:31.880 --> 19:33.632
but you had the courage to kill him?

19:33.680 --> 19:36.911
You know how you were kind of joking
about me dating a cheerleader?

19:52.920 --> 19:55.593
- Well...
- No, don't say it.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.356
Unbelievable. Who is it?

19:59.840 --> 20:02.400
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

20:02.040 --> 20:05.715
- Brooke Davis? Lucas, she is horrible.
- No, she's not horrible.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.834
- Actually, she's a really amazing person.
- Have you forgotten our freshman year?

20:08.760 --> 20:10.398
As much of it as I can, yes.

20:12.680 --> 20:16.150
Morgan Finley, senior bitch,
captain of the cheerleaders.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.391
You know how much she tortured
me and my friends.

20:17.960 --> 20:21.669
Until one day some freshman boy
came along and defended me.

20:20.040 --> 20:22.076
Some boy named Lucas Scott.

20:23.920 --> 20:27.708
After that, they tortured you all year,
but you took it,

20:26.360 --> 20:29.875
'cause if they were torturing you
they wouldn't pick on any of us.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.396
Oh, yeah. That was a fun year.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.075
When I moved away

20:37.080 --> 20:40.277
Brooke Davis was Morgan Finley's
most promising protégé.

20:38.280 --> 20:41.511
- She's different now.
- Maybe you're different now.

20:42.160 --> 20:46.312
You said you would never join that club.
The elite and the popular.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.559
So tell me something, Luke.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.593
Now that you're basically
the king of that club,

20:53.400 --> 20:55.277
who's looking out for the people like me?

20:56.240 --> 20:58.708
The ones who are afraid to go to school?

20:59.600 --> 21:03.798
That's not how it is, Faith.
Look, I'm not defending who Brooke was.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.230
I am defending who she is.

21:07.720 --> 21:10.837
And trust me,
she never became Morgan Finley.

21:10.760 --> 21:12.637
That's it!
No more cookie breaks for anybody!

21:13.960 --> 21:15.791
Do you people want to be here all night?

21:15.920 --> 21:19.310
Hey, you're Mouth, right?
You announce the basketball games.

21:20.360 --> 21:23.033
- I'm Rachel.
- Yeah, I know who you are.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.997
I've listened to your interviews
on the school website.

21:26.960 --> 21:29.679
- You're really good.
- Really? Thanks.

21:30.080 --> 21:34.870
- It's just practice for, hopefully, the future.
- So what's your thing?

21:32.960 --> 21:34.188
- My thing?
- Yeah.

21:39.280 --> 21:41.748
You know,
every great sports announcer has a thing.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.910
Like Phil Rizzuto has, "Holy cow!"

21:43.160 --> 21:46.072
And, Marv Albert has, "Yes!"

21:46.560 --> 21:48.869
A little more work, a little less talk.

21:52.480 --> 21:55.711
- We were just discussing Mouth's thing.
- Yeah, it's

21:55.520 --> 21:57.909
not really what it sounds like, Brooke.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.472
Isn't he the cutest?

22:02.480 --> 22:05.358
Oh, well, I hate to interrupt
the male bonding

22:04.160 --> 22:06.355
but, Mouth, I need you to watch the kids.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.873
- I thought Haley was watching them.
- Well, now you're watching them.

22:09.400 --> 22:10.674
Chop-chop.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.912
Haley, will you please
go pick up more fabric?

22:16.760 --> 22:20.070
- I thought that was Mouth's job.
- Will you please just do what I ask, Haley?

22:18.520 --> 22:21.990
- My day has been a total crap fest.
- I guess Lucas didn't check in, then, huh?

22:21.920 --> 22:24.388
So? It's not like I don't have problems
of my own to worry about.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.511
And why are you so concerned
with whether or not Lucas calls me?

22:28.080 --> 22:30.071
- How is that any of your business?
- I just want to know

22:30.160 --> 22:32.993
what would make a guy leave you
first thing in the morning like that.

22:32.240 --> 22:35.550
- It just doesn't seem right.
- Thanks for rubbing that in, roommate.

22:35.160 --> 22:38.232
So I was wondering,
this song you want to produce,

22:46.520 --> 22:48.556
what makes you think I could help with it?

22:49.680 --> 22:53.798
Well, I mean, mostly 'cause you know
a lot about music and the industry

22:52.280 --> 22:55.909
and, I mean, you do have
a really nice little collection here.

22:56.480 --> 22:57.708
Little?

23:00.760 --> 23:03.957
It's like heaven.
Only it probably sounds better.

23:18.400 --> 23:19.719
Cure fan?

23:22.360 --> 23:26.319
- Up until this album.
- Come on. <i>Wish</i> is a great record.

23:25.240 --> 23:29.153
No, <i>Disintegration</i> is a great record.
<i>Wish</i> was pretty much the end.

23:29.280 --> 23:30.508
Oh, really?

23:33.280 --> 23:36.397
You're gonna tell me you don't get chills
every time you hear the violin

23:34.600 --> 23:37.558
- on <i>To Wish lmpossible Things?</i>
- Yeah, every time.

23:37.800 --> 23:40.314
- But?
- But I don't remember the day.

23:40.840 --> 23:43.513
- The day?
- Yeah, you know, it's like...

23:44.000 --> 23:45.433
Like with <i>Disintegration,</i>

23:47.520 --> 23:49.988
I remember the very first time
I heard that record.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.156
You know, like,
I remember everything about that day,

23:51.600 --> 23:54.478
the weather outside
and the smell in the air. I just...

23:53.800 --> 23:55.028
I remember all those things

23:56.960 --> 24:00.430
and that's because that day
I fell in love with something.

23:58.280 --> 24:00.555
- You fell in love with an album.
- No.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.433
I fell in love with music.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.036
So, speaking of The Cure,

24:12.320 --> 24:14.390
- are you in remission?
- Oh.

24:16.600 --> 24:19.319
- I'm sorry. I...
- No, no.

24:20.440 --> 24:21.873
The truth is

24:26.320 --> 24:27.958
I'm probably gonna be just fine.

24:29.720 --> 24:32.439
Oh, okay. That's great. That's...

24:33.200 --> 24:35.077
I'm really glad for you, Ellie.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.273
So, anyway,

24:40.400 --> 24:44.154
I was thinking that if you are gonna
help me with Haley's record

24:42.000 --> 24:45.310
that, well, you could maybe
move into the house with me.

24:45.920 --> 24:49.549
My dad, you know, he's out to sea,
and he said it's okay.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.514
So,

24:53.240 --> 24:56.630
- what do you think?
- I appreciate the invitation, Peyton.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.192
I just... I just really don't have the time.

24:58.680 --> 24:59.795
Yeah.

25:04.080 --> 25:05.638
But stay a bit.

25:06.240 --> 25:09.915
There's got to be some other albums here
that you are dead wrong about.

25:08.360 --> 25:10.715
So you rode here with Peyton Sawyer?

25:16.760 --> 25:20.833
- Man, Tree Hill is tripping since I left.
- Yeah, you're right about that.

25:19.880 --> 25:21.677
So tell me about your life, Faith.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.477
- Are you happy here?
- I guess so.

25:26.480 --> 25:30.473
It took me a little while to get used to it,
leaving Tree Hill, changing schools.

25:28.440 --> 25:31.193
But now it's basically same life,
different town.

25:32.520 --> 25:34.750
- Well, your mom sounds good.
- Yeah, she is.

25:35.360 --> 25:36.998
Finally got a good coaching job.

25:37.680 --> 25:39.159
Not too many schools out there
are gonna let

25:39.400 --> 25:40.992
a woman coach a boys' basketball team.

25:40.960 --> 25:45.192
- Yeah, well, if anyone can do it, she can.
- Definitely true.

25:42.640 --> 25:45.996
Look what we have here.
One of the Tree Hill Ravens.

25:54.240 --> 25:55.559
Fan club?

25:59.160 --> 26:02.391
- You losers win a game yet?
- You losers call next?

26:02.280 --> 26:05.795
- There's nobody here.
- Really? 'Cause we're here.

26:05.760 --> 26:10.072
Game to 11 by ones, win by two.
Winners stay, losers walk.

26:10.840 --> 26:12.796
What, us two against him?

26:17.560 --> 26:18.834
No.

26:20.480 --> 26:23.074
You two against us.

26:21.840 --> 26:25.992
- Our ball.
- Same jump shot, different town.

26:29.880 --> 26:30.949
Yes!

27:04.120 --> 27:06.793
9-6. How's my hair? Still sexy?

27:05.960 --> 27:07.518
She's a girl, for God sakes, man.
Guard her.

27:09.040 --> 27:10.553
You guard her.

27:10.680 --> 27:13.035
- Game.
- Okay, then. Nice to see you guys.

27:18.280 --> 27:20.748
Take care. See you later. Bye.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.871
Nice game, Luke.
Brooke Davis would be proud.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.028
Can I sit with you? Please.

27:43.480 --> 27:45.675
How did it come to this, Mom?

27:49.240 --> 27:52.118
I ask myself that question
every single day.

27:53.320 --> 27:56.596
I've been sitting here
thinking about my 13th birthday.

28:00.640 --> 28:05.111
Dad surprised me with Hawks tickets,
front row, on the court.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.918
We drove all the way to Atlanta,
the three of us.

28:10.320 --> 28:13.790
I remember that trip,
how much fun we had as a family.

28:13.240 --> 28:16.869
I just wanted to replay that memory,
just to remember it.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.111
Then I saw your face.

28:24.480 --> 28:26.755
It was always right there in front of me,
and I never saw it.

28:28.480 --> 28:31.358
- What?
- You were never happy.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.671
Dad is a bad guy, Mom,

28:36.640 --> 28:38.596
but somewhere deep down

28:39.680 --> 28:42.592
he still just wants me to be
the best I can be.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.029
He doesn't deserve to die for that.

28:45.040 --> 28:46.109
Two years ago,

28:52.080 --> 28:55.436
the coach from Oak Lake Academy
came to see your father to recruit you.

28:53.240 --> 28:56.755
The number-one high-school
basketball program in the country,

28:56.680 --> 28:59.399
and your father sent him away.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.510
- He wouldn't do that.
- He did.

29:03.560 --> 29:05.710
And I told him
it wasn't his decision to make.

29:06.240 --> 29:09.073
You were gonna go to that school
whether he liked it or not.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.756
- And that I was leaving with you.
- What did he say?

29:11.400 --> 29:14.551
He looked at me. He spoke calmly.

29:16.120 --> 29:19.192
He said that if I took you away
he would find us.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.632
And he would kill me.

29:26.800 --> 29:28.552
Don't you see, Nathan?

29:29.640 --> 29:33.918
Your father will always try to control you.
He'll never let you go.

29:31.720 --> 29:33.790
You know, thanks for reminding me
of a few things today.

29:48.160 --> 29:49.639
- Like what?
- Well,

29:50.320 --> 29:53.153
how much fun we used to have
hanging out at the River Court all day,

29:52.720 --> 29:55.029
playing ball, growing up.

29:55.640 --> 29:57.835
Yeah, it was like old times, wasn't it?

29:58.240 --> 30:01.915
Yeah, it was.
No uniforms, no crowds, no cheerleaders.

30:00.520 --> 30:02.078
Just you and me and the game.

30:04.280 --> 30:07.238
I almost forgot what it was like
playing just to play.

30:05.920 --> 30:08.957
Speak for yourself.
I wanted to crush those guys.

30:09.480 --> 30:12.199
I was right about you, you know,
that you've changed.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.834
But I think maybe it's for the best.

30:17.120 --> 30:20.430
Okay, you've teased me all day
about how much I've changed,

30:20.240 --> 30:21.958
- what about you?
- What about me?

30:23.960 --> 30:26.235
Well, for a girl who used to be afraid
to go to school,

30:25.760 --> 30:28.399
you sure stood up to those guys
at the court.

30:28.120 --> 30:30.759
Like I said, maybe it's for the best.

30:30.840 --> 30:33.513
So you said back there
I reminded you of a few things.

30:34.320 --> 30:37.392
- What else?
- How much I miss seeing you.

30:37.440 --> 30:39.158
Yeah, that's like a no-brainer.

30:40.920 --> 30:43.992
- Don't be a stranger, Luke.
- You know, the phone goes both ways.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.594
Yeah, I know,
but I didn't say, "Keep in touch."

30:49.240 --> 30:51.071
I said, "Don't be a stranger."

30:51.840 --> 30:53.114
All right.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.669
Bevin.

31:04.320 --> 31:06.470
This is terrible. The stitching is all wrong.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.597
I missed the tutorial.

31:08.960 --> 31:12.669
- This is actually kind of perfect.
- I know.

31:16.480 --> 31:19.074
But it's mine.
I ordered it online this morning.

31:21.360 --> 31:23.828
Wait a second. You came over here
to make your own dress?

31:24.040 --> 31:26.793
Well, I liked the design.
I just didn't trust the designer.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.591
See you, Mouth. Call me.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.195
Bye.

31:33.120 --> 31:36.317
Well, great! Thanks, everybody,
for wasting my time today.

31:34.680 --> 31:37.319
Brooke, stop it. Everybody here's been
busting their butt for you

31:37.960 --> 31:39.712
and you've pretty much been a bitch
all day long.

31:40.680 --> 31:41.874
We haven't gotten anything done.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.317
I have been dreaming about this
for so long.

31:43.800 --> 31:45.028
- Don't you understand?
- No.

31:45.680 --> 31:49.116
Not if it changes you, Brooke.
Trust me, no dream is worth that.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.230
Shut it down, Mouth. All of it.

31:59.120 --> 32:01.873
- Brooke, that's not...
- No, just stop the orders

32:01.640 --> 32:03.631
and give everybody their money back.

32:04.480 --> 32:06.232
We spent most of the money, Brooke.

32:07.720 --> 32:10.792
How do you think we bought
all the material and supplies?

32:09.560 --> 32:12.552
Then I'll finish it myself. It's my problem.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.715
Everybody, just go home, please.

32:17.680 --> 32:20.831
I'm really sorry
for the way that I treated all of you today.

32:21.120 --> 32:22.997
I haven't been myself.

32:25.760 --> 32:29.753
Hey, kids. Hey, here, will you take these?

32:28.480 --> 32:30.550
Thanks. I'm so sorry.

32:33.120 --> 32:35.190
That was a really nice thing to do, Brooke,

32:37.160 --> 32:38.593
with my CDs.

32:40.560 --> 32:43.791
I can't believe you saw
the first U2 tour in the States.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.509
Yeah.

32:57.760 --> 33:01.719
They opened for The Psychedelic Furs.
And if you're lucky,

32:59.040 --> 33:02.271
I might even have a T-shirt from that tour
somewhere around here.

33:03.400 --> 33:06.233
Hey, I'm gonna get some water.
Can I get you some?

33:12.160 --> 33:15.197
So this is it? There's no food, Ellie!

33:37.200 --> 33:39.430
And there's barely any furniture!

33:40.320 --> 33:43.232
Nothing like, what? A bed and a rocking
soundtrack to die to, right?

33:42.680 --> 33:44.398
You don't know what you're talking about.

33:45.680 --> 33:47.511
You came here to die.

33:48.720 --> 33:52.838
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Don't I deserve the truth?

33:52.720 --> 33:53.869
The truth?

33:56.920 --> 33:59.673
The truth is I don't have any furniture
because I'm always on the road.

33:58.160 --> 34:01.391
I don't keep any food in the house
because I eat out.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.592
This is the way I've always lived, Peyton.

34:05.240 --> 34:08.630
Except I usually get the added
benefit of being alone.

34:06.920 --> 34:09.559
At least for the last 17 years, I did.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.753
You didn't come here
to seek music advice.

34:19.120 --> 34:21.793
You came here out of guilt.
And guess what?

34:23.639 --> 34:26.279
I don't want it, and I don't need it.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.072
In fact, get out.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.676
You know what? Fine. Fine! Fine!
You're right, okay?

34:35.679 --> 34:39.275
So I came to see how you are.
Is that so bad?

34:39.040 --> 34:42.828
Am I such a horrible person
because I was worried about you?

34:42.920 --> 34:43.989
I just...

34:47.760 --> 34:49.876
I thought we could do something
really good together, okay?

34:48.920 --> 34:51.388
Maybe even something, like, great.

34:51.120 --> 34:54.748
I wanted to sell that record so we could
raise money for cancer research.

34:54.719 --> 34:56.233
Sorry I cared.

34:58.600 --> 35:00.955
So I guess this is goodbye, Mom.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.836
Just for a little while.

35:15.760 --> 35:17.990
I'll never leave you for good.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.077
You know,
I'm not so good on my own, either.

35:20.520 --> 35:23.910
The day you emancipated yourself,
you broke my heart.

35:26.360 --> 35:29.238
And now I realize it was
your strongest moment.

35:30.520 --> 35:32.750
Hopefully I can find that kind of strength.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.951
I don't want to be alone.

35:39.640 --> 35:42.473
You're not alone. You have Haley.

35:43.200 --> 35:45.760
Go home and deal with your marriage.

35:47.520 --> 35:51.195
Don't avoid it until it becomes
something you have to run from.

35:51.600 --> 35:52.589
Okay.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.119
Bye, Mom.

36:07.840 --> 36:08.909
Bye.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.592
I'm sorry about Ellie.

36:28.040 --> 36:30.474
I don't think
I'm ever gonna see her again, Luke.

36:30.800 --> 36:34.588
- Hi. Where are you?
<i>- Hey, Brooke, I'm really sorry,</i>

37:02.240 --> 37:04.993
<i>but it's gonna be a little while.</i>
<i>Peyton's car broke down.</i>

37:06.120 --> 37:07.599
Great.

37:09.360 --> 37:13.319
So the two of you are gonna have to spend
the night in some seedy motel.

37:10.920 --> 37:14.310
Yeah, and then
one thing will lead to another, and...

37:15.160 --> 37:18.072
- Pretty risky trick, mister.
- You weren't worried, were you?

37:20.880 --> 37:23.110
Totally not for a second worried.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.913
What? Bad day?

37:30.560 --> 37:32.676
I just really needed my boyfriend.

37:33.320 --> 37:37.598
- Well, he's here now. Put me to work.
- I don't want to work anymore.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.272
Can we go do something you want to do?

37:40.280 --> 37:43.113
Actually, I have something I need to go do.

37:42.120 --> 37:44.111
- Okay.
- With you.

37:46.480 --> 37:48.357
<i>You have one message.</i>

37:53.320 --> 37:56.630
<i>Miss Hart, this is Dr. Gold calling</i>
<i>from East Lake Memorial.</i>

37:55.320 --> 37:58.471
<i>It is extremely important</i>
<i>that you call me back.</i>

37:58.720 --> 38:02.793
<i>As I said earlier, we need to talk</i>
<i>about your decision to stop treatment.</i>

38:02.360 --> 38:04.555
<i>I really, really urge you to consider...</i>

38:06.520 --> 38:09.353
You're right. The song's good.

38:39.440 --> 38:42.955
- Needs background vocals.
- Yeah, it's just a demo.

38:44.240 --> 38:47.391
- It's a business arrangement.
- Of course.

38:47.960 --> 38:49.029
Hey.

39:01.960 --> 39:03.313
What's up?

39:03.720 --> 39:06.439
I just wanted to see you.

39:05.840 --> 39:09.310
This is my world, Brooke.
Or at least it used to be.

39:22.040 --> 39:24.952
- I have been here before, you know.
- I know.

39:25.960 --> 39:28.315
I just never told you
what this place is to me.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.791
It's not just a court.

39:34.040 --> 39:38.033
It's where I came from. It's where I belong.
It's my world.

39:36.560 --> 39:39.870
- So, do I get to be a part of this world?
- The biggest part.

39:41.080 --> 39:43.753
Ladies and gentlemen,
what a treat we have tonight.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.357
River Court legend Lucas Scott.

39:47.240 --> 39:49.515
It's been months since Scott's run
a full-court game here.

39:49.600 --> 39:52.592
So I guess the big question is,
will he play tonight?

39:51.960 --> 39:53.791
Go get them, boyfriend.

39:57.960 --> 39:58.995
Nice shot.

40:14.840 --> 40:15.875
