00:09.238 --> 00:11.119
Kenny, which type
of fruit do you want?

00:11.239 --> 00:13.497
Everyone gets to take
one piece of fruit.

00:13.617 --> 00:15.255
I don't want fruit!

00:15.580 --> 00:16.892
- Well, what do you want?
- This!

00:18.217 --> 00:21.800
Oopsie. We like cereals in
the big plastic bags. Remember?

00:21.920 --> 00:23.843
I want this kind, little sucker!

00:23.963 --> 00:26.138
Little Kenny, stop it.
Don't call Daddy names.

00:26.373 --> 00:27.661
Dick licker, dick licker!

00:27.781 --> 00:29.506
Kendra, Daddy does
not lick dicks.

00:29.539 --> 00:31.131
Kendall, stop it.

00:31.251 --> 00:32.704
Dick licker, dick licker!

00:34.091 --> 00:35.826
I'm not a dick licker!

00:35.957 --> 00:37.394
Maria, can you handle them?

00:37.427 --> 00:39.638
They're getting
a little out of control.

00:42.816 --> 00:44.253
Credit please.

00:49.463 --> 00:50.562
It ain't going through.

00:50.595 --> 00:52.674
It's an old card. You might
have to try a couple times.

00:52.707 --> 00:53.742
Use the stamps.

00:53.783 --> 00:55.655
No. Keep trying.

00:55.688 --> 00:57.567
Maria, take the kids
out to the car, please.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.167
<i>Vamonos, vamonos.</i>

01:03.012 --> 01:04.361
Still denied?

I'm just...

01:14.640 --> 01:16.686
Uh...

01:16.719 --> 01:19.054
Hey! Stop him!

01:30.758 --> 01:32.893
See kids,
by putting this pool in

01:32.926 --> 01:35.866
is gonna increase the property
values of our home.

01:35.931 --> 01:38.745
Protect our shit from
the fucking subprimes.

01:38.778 --> 01:41.146
Kenny, what is going on?

01:41.179 --> 01:42.979
I, uh, I'm digging a pool.

01:43.012 --> 01:45.086
Why are the kids out here.
Why aren't you ready for work?

01:45.151 --> 01:46.119
'Cause I quit my job.

01:46.152 --> 01:47.687
I'm Django Unchained up
in this motherfucker.

01:47.720 --> 01:49.023
Signed my own freedom papers.

01:49.056 --> 01:52.559
- What makes you think you can do this?
- Uh, drugs.

01:52.592 --> 01:55.368
And said drugs finally
lifted a very confusing haze

01:55.401 --> 01:57.032
that had been lingering over me
for some time now.

01:57.065 --> 01:58.505
Be honest with yourself.

01:58.538 --> 02:00.737
If this family
was really happy,

02:00.770 --> 02:02.505
would I be having dreams
about cheating on you

02:02.538 --> 02:03.611
almost every single night?

02:03.644 --> 02:06.045
You have dreams
of cheating on me?

02:06.118 --> 02:08.652
I try to close my eyes and not take part in it.
But it's... I can't.

02:08.686 --> 02:10.656
Every single night
I go to sleep.

02:10.689 --> 02:12.362
Toby's teacher comes in,
school bus driver comes in.

02:12.395 --> 02:14.426
Both of them start fucking going down on me.
Next thing I know,

02:14.499 --> 02:15.866
lesbian principal's in there.

02:15.899 --> 02:17.179
I'm fucking turning her out too.

02:17.235 --> 02:19.035
I don't want to
do that shit, April.

02:19.068 --> 02:21.510
The days of Kenny Powers
turning out lesbians

02:21.543 --> 02:22.464
are fucking behind him.

02:22.473 --> 02:24.881
Kenny, what is going on?

02:24.914 --> 02:27.346
I can no longer hide
from my stardom. OK?

02:27.387 --> 02:29.786
Fame, fortune, adventure.

02:29.819 --> 02:30.922
What dreams may come?

02:30.955 --> 02:33.186
I gave all this shit up
for you.

02:33.219 --> 02:35.323
Now it's time for you
to return the favor.

02:35.356 --> 02:36.460
I need you to support
me in my efforts

02:36.493 --> 02:39.795
to step back in
the public spotlight.

02:39.828 --> 02:41.564
Can you do that?

02:43.606 --> 02:45.705
Let's go, kids.

02:45.746 --> 02:47.611
Oh, you're gonna
take my workers?

02:47.644 --> 02:49.883
Is that a walk away in support?

02:51.020 --> 02:52.955
Is it?

02:52.988 --> 02:54.483
OK.

02:58.861 --> 03:00.557
Fuck?

03:00.598 --> 03:02.998
Guy. Woo hoo hoo.

03:04.168 --> 03:05.671
- Peek-a-boo.
- Kenny.

03:05.704 --> 03:08.038
You got that bath salts,
motherfucker?

03:08.071 --> 03:10.038
- What?
- I'm fucking playing, dog.

03:10.103 --> 03:12.479
- Hallucinogenics.
- Oh.

03:12.512 --> 03:14.512
This burger's delicious.
Goddamn.

03:14.545 --> 03:17.048
Damn it. I told them a turkey
club with no bread.

03:21.858 --> 03:23.753
- Kenny, you high?
- Huh?

03:23.786 --> 03:26.192
Are you high?

03:26.225 --> 03:29.098
Nope, not anymore.
Percocets just wore off.

03:29.131 --> 03:30.764
You been waiting
at the gate all morning?

03:30.797 --> 03:31.733
Nah, just since nine.

03:31.766 --> 03:33.535
But your ass fucking
drops in at lunch.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.504
Taking a half a day,
you fucking slacker.

03:37.473 --> 03:40.814
Oh shit. Guy,
on the serious tip,

03:40.880 --> 03:42.879
really glad me and you had
this chance to reconnect.

03:42.912 --> 03:44.118
The other night,

03:44.151 --> 03:46.809
all that dancing,
all that fucking talking?

03:46.850 --> 03:47.881
Super inspiring.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.346
I had to fucking reevaluate
my whole deal, dog.

03:50.387 --> 03:52.123
It was a fun night, Kenny.
I'm glad you came out.

03:52.156 --> 03:53.556
Really got me thinking.

03:53.589 --> 03:56.387
Perhaps it is high time
my shit gets famous again.

03:56.460 --> 03:58.059
- Oh.
- Oh yeah.

03:58.092 --> 03:59.426
I even so far as to fucking

03:59.459 --> 04:00.961
quit my bullshit 9 to 5.

04:01.026 --> 04:02.697
Wait a second. I didn't...

04:02.762 --> 04:04.034
I didn't tell you to
quit your job, did I?

04:04.067 --> 04:06.129
Hey, look. Don't get weird.
It was in the subtext.

04:06.202 --> 04:07.934
You basically did
tell me to quit my job,

04:07.967 --> 04:09.597
but I don't give a fuck.
This is what I should do.

04:09.630 --> 04:12.039
You've finally fucking
woken me up.

04:12.072 --> 04:14.873
I mean, I put my whole entire family's
financial well being on the line.

04:14.906 --> 04:17.839
I'm not going to be able to fucking
feed or cloth my children.

04:17.880 --> 04:20.004
That's how serious
I'm taking this fame bullshit.

04:20.045 --> 04:22.137
I just need somebody
to give me a shot.

04:23.810 --> 04:25.683
You know what, Kenny?

04:25.716 --> 04:27.212
I'm going to give you a shot.

04:27.252 --> 04:29.182
I'm gonna get you a co-host
spot on Thursday's show.

04:29.223 --> 04:30.516
What do you think about that?

04:30.549 --> 04:32.251
Ooh. What the fuck does
that mean? What is that?

04:32.284 --> 04:33.848
You can sit down next
to the other guys

04:33.888 --> 04:36.117
and we can talk about
sports on <i>Sports Sesh.</i>

04:36.182 --> 04:37.750
Holy shit.

04:37.791 --> 04:38.854
Me on fucking TV?

04:38.887 --> 04:40.623
Dude, I'll guest host
my fucking ass off

04:40.728 --> 04:42.295
every single day
if that's what it takes?

04:42.326 --> 04:43.924
Well, it's just going
to be one show, so...

04:43.957 --> 04:45.660
All right. Well that's fine.
I can fucking get famous again.

04:45.693 --> 04:47.763
I can get famous off of that.
That's great.

04:47.796 --> 04:50.194
If it happens on one show,
then good for you.

04:50.227 --> 04:52.529
Fine. Famous again.

04:52.562 --> 04:54.863
- Yeah.
- Let's get on TV.

04:54.896 --> 04:58.733
Great job, TK. I'll see
you next week, OK?

04:58.766 --> 05:00.470
- Bye.
- Stevie, what you doing?

05:00.503 --> 05:02.270
Oh, I just gave a lesson to TK.

05:02.303 --> 05:04.745
This bill, under pillow.
You no pay bill?

05:04.778 --> 05:07.746
Well, I was gonna pay it, we're
just a little cash poor right now.

05:07.779 --> 05:11.383
- I didn't want you to worry.
- You are supposed to be a man.

05:11.448 --> 05:13.380
I'm sorry, Maria.

05:13.445 --> 05:15.115
I'm sorr... Ow!

05:16.851 --> 05:18.412
- You pussy.
- I'm not a pussy.

05:19.554 --> 05:22.382
You die. No you die.

05:22.415 --> 05:24.747
Yo, Kenny, Kendall, Kendra,
what's shaking?

05:26.147 --> 05:27.481
I'm not your Uncle.
Please don't call me that.

05:27.514 --> 05:29.523
- I'm not related to you.
- What's cracking, brother?

05:29.556 --> 05:30.789
Oh gross. The one that's
shares my name

05:30.822 --> 05:32.725
is over there
picking his fucking boogs.

05:32.758 --> 05:35.364
They all share your name and
they all pick their boogs.

05:35.429 --> 05:36.690
Come here.

05:36.731 --> 05:39.098
Oh my gosh, I miss that smell.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.235
Please don't smell me, Steve.
Just hug. OK?

05:41.300 --> 05:43.130
Good to see you, brother.

05:43.170 --> 05:46.567
I will fucking kill you!

05:46.600 --> 05:48.735
TV, Kenny.
That's fucking epic.

05:48.768 --> 05:50.774
TV is a big deal.

05:50.807 --> 05:52.605
No shit, dog. This fucking TV
shit could kick this

05:52.638 --> 05:55.276
goddamn Kenny Powers brand right
where it needs to be, dude.

05:55.309 --> 05:56.803
I'm talking fucking product
endorsements,

05:56.844 --> 05:59.075
restaurant chains, sex tapes.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.707
A motherfucking fragrance.

06:00.780 --> 06:02.881
Ooh, a fragrance.
That's good.

06:02.914 --> 06:06.616
So what do you think? Ready to leave your
shitty life behind and fucking join me?

06:06.649 --> 06:09.247
Oh, Kenny,
that's appealing, but

06:09.319 --> 06:11.516
unfortunately I work
for myself now.

06:11.549 --> 06:16.056
You give saxophone lessons, dude. What
is that, like fucking 20 bucks an hour?

06:16.161 --> 06:18.654
Come on, dude. I'm giving you a shot
to get that fucking mega payday

06:18.695 --> 06:19.925
that you and I never got, man.

06:19.958 --> 06:22.691
Well, that's really
nice of you, but look

06:22.724 --> 06:24.196
I have all this.
I just can't swing it.

06:24.229 --> 06:26.733
What, this modular home?
This place is a shit hole.

06:26.766 --> 06:29.236
What? Are you...
Are you blind?

06:29.302 --> 06:30.771
This is practically brand new.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.240
Yes, I'm not blind, dude. Look at
the fucking craftsmanship, dude.

06:33.273 --> 06:36.310
These shitty ass fucking cabinets.
This fucking bullshit bar.

06:36.343 --> 06:38.712
What, laminate tiles?
Give me a fucking break.

06:38.745 --> 06:41.784
Kenny, I have responsibilities.

06:41.817 --> 06:43.319
I have four kids.

06:43.352 --> 06:45.349
Dude, I have two
white kids, dog.

06:45.382 --> 06:48.189
Straight up white kids. And I know
they're a lot more fucking expensive

06:48.222 --> 06:50.159
to take care of than
fucking four Mexicans, dude.

06:50.192 --> 06:52.729
Four Mexican kids
is equal to two white kids.

06:52.794 --> 06:55.327
Fine. Do whatever.
Don't fucking join me, man.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.431
Go about your own shit.
But just know this,

06:57.464 --> 07:00.231
if you're not with me,
you're against me. OK?

07:00.271 --> 07:02.333
I just made you into a
terrorist, bitch. How bout that?

07:02.366 --> 07:05.639
From this moment forward,
I fucking hate you, dog.

07:05.672 --> 07:09.407
Fine. If that's how you
want it. Then we're enemies.

07:09.448 --> 07:11.278
Enemy combatants.
The next time I see you,

07:11.311 --> 07:13.246
I'll fucking light you up.

07:13.279 --> 07:15.080
- I'll strike you, motherfucker.
- Motherfucker, you don't...

07:15.153 --> 07:17.416
- That's my cabinet.
- Fuck that cabinet, bitch.

07:17.456 --> 07:19.351
Get out of here.

07:19.384 --> 07:21.888
- Fucking napkins.
- No, not the napkins.

07:21.960 --> 07:24.025
I'm not afraid to kill you.

07:24.058 --> 07:26.131
I am your worst night...

07:26.164 --> 07:28.003
You didn't let me finish.

07:28.036 --> 07:30.265
Open that door.

07:30.298 --> 07:33.101
I... don't drop my chandelier!

07:33.134 --> 07:34.701
Don't drop my chandelier!

07:42.939 --> 07:44.474
Wife.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.145
If you weren't married to me and
saw this shit on the street

07:46.178 --> 07:48.272
would you try to
fucking pound this ass?

07:48.377 --> 07:49.512
Be honest with me.

07:49.545 --> 07:51.311
'Cause right now I'm starting
to kind of feel like Oprah.

07:51.344 --> 07:52.582
Big and black.

07:52.711 --> 07:54.477
So you're really going
through with this?

07:54.511 --> 07:56.716
Yes, April. Why you think
I'm all dressed up for?

07:56.749 --> 07:59.314
That's nice. What does it pay?

07:59.347 --> 08:02.511
Well, you know I had to put down
2,400 bucks to join SAG.

08:02.551 --> 08:03.918
Besides that, we gotta kind of
look at this as an investment.

08:03.952 --> 08:05.687
So, nothing?

08:05.721 --> 08:08.391
Don't patronize me. Can't you
put your jealous rage aside

08:08.424 --> 08:09.685
for at least one moment
and be supportive?

08:09.758 --> 08:11.754
I support this whole family.

08:11.787 --> 08:13.287
Because I'm the only
one with a job.

08:13.320 --> 08:16.853
Ooh, disgusting.
Shame on you.

08:16.886 --> 08:18.524
I'll put a curse on you.

08:20.093 --> 08:21.786
I'll put a curse
on this whole family.

08:21.820 --> 08:23.320
- That's rude.
- Just remember this shit

08:23.354 --> 08:25.358
when I come home and have
a victory celebration.

08:25.391 --> 08:28.954
'Cause I kicked ass on the show and I
eat a whole goddamn pizza by myself.

08:28.987 --> 08:31.090
Don't share a one
single slice with you.

08:31.123 --> 08:33.522
No slices for wife.

08:44.624 --> 08:46.897
That's the last time you
get me for scale, Ding-dong.

08:48.465 --> 08:50.566
Guys. You remember these
douchebags, right?

08:50.599 --> 08:51.797
- Oh, hell yeah.
- Hey, Kenny.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.836
- What's up man?
- Tight times the other evening, boys.

08:53.869 --> 08:55.534
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, lots of dancing.

08:55.567 --> 08:58.943
And this fuck you didn't meet 'cause
he didn't come to my charity event.

08:59.008 --> 09:00.069
This is Dontel Benjamin.

09:00.110 --> 09:02.275
He is the wild card
of our team.

09:02.308 --> 09:04.010
Oh, word, The wild card.
Nice to meet you.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.108
Y'all, throw that out.

09:06.148 --> 09:08.550
Took her drawers off, all I saw
was stretch marks and dimples.

09:08.583 --> 09:11.023
You talking about the midget?
The midget? The midget did that?

09:14.988 --> 09:17.757
All right. This is the moment
of truth, Kenny, you ready?

09:17.790 --> 09:19.360
Yes. Yes, I'm ready.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.065
OK. Let's go buddy.

09:21.098 --> 09:23.168
OK. We're live in five,

09:23.201 --> 09:26.333
- four, three.
- Showtime.

09:30.939 --> 09:33.738
Yes, yes, y'all.
You know what time it is.

09:33.771 --> 09:36.209
It's time for <i>Sports Sesh.</i>

09:36.242 --> 09:40.040
And here's your host, Guy Young.

09:49.988 --> 09:51.059
Kenny. Kenny.

09:51.092 --> 09:52.354
- Shoot it, Kenny.
- Shoot it, Kenny!

09:52.387 --> 09:54.657
- For three.
- Oh!

10:00.098 --> 10:03.698
<i>Dontel still got it.</i>
<i>Dontel still got it.</i>

10:05.971 --> 10:07.441
<i>Hey, welcome to another</i>
<i>session of</i> Sports Sesh.

10:07.474 --> 10:10.235
<i>I'm Guy Young, and these guys are
getting old and they're out of shape.</i>

10:10.242 --> 10:11.642
<i>True story.</i>

10:11.675 --> 10:13.145
We have a very special
show for you today

10:13.178 --> 10:15.777
because we have a very special
guest, Mr. Kenny Powers.

10:15.810 --> 10:17.218
<i>Wonderful to be here.</i>

10:17.251 --> 10:19.786
<i>Thank you very much</i>
<i>for having me here. Thank you.</i>

10:19.820 --> 10:22.016
<i>And if you remember,</i>
<i>we did a story on this</i>

10:22.049 --> 10:24.485
<i>a few years ago, he walked away</i>
<i>from the game of baseball.</i>

10:24.518 --> 10:26.189
<i>But that wasn't</i>
<i>the strange thing.</i>

10:26.254 --> 10:28.355
<i>He walked away literally</i>
<i>right in the middle of a game.</i>

10:28.388 --> 10:29.785
<i>- Crazy.</i>
<i>- It was crazy, right?</i>

10:29.818 --> 10:32.384
That's the craziest thing
I ever heard. Who does that?

10:32.425 --> 10:34.088
Well, you guys,
I did what I had to do.

10:34.121 --> 10:36.089
I gave up fame for true love.

10:36.130 --> 10:37.898
Na-na-na-na. Love?

10:37.931 --> 10:39.393
I wanna see what
that stripper look like.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.830
Whoa, so she calls you
and says, "Hey, boo boo,

10:43.863 --> 10:46.133
I need you to go ahead and cut
out on the game, my back hurt."

10:48.637 --> 10:51.740
Uh, there was no phone call.

10:51.805 --> 10:53.308
I faked my death and then
showed up at her doorstep.

10:53.341 --> 10:55.004
Oh, hell no!

10:55.077 --> 10:57.075
Here we go.

10:57.108 --> 10:59.275
Did this man just say
he became a ghost for a ho?

10:59.308 --> 11:01.846
<i>Oh, now I done heard it all!</i>

11:03.488 --> 11:05.320
- Mm.
- <i>Well, that's very amusing.</i>

11:05.353 --> 11:06.991
It's kinda funny but

11:07.024 --> 11:07.959
I actually have a very...

11:07.992 --> 11:09.432
Na-na-na-na. Look.
I just remembered,

11:09.455 --> 11:10.816
I got a bone to pick with you,
Guy.

11:10.822 --> 11:12.220
- Uh oh. Here we go.
- Now last week

11:12.261 --> 11:15.166
he sat up here and told all
of us that those rumors about

11:15.199 --> 11:17.427
Daniel Green getting that
Georgia cheerleader pregnant

11:17.460 --> 11:18.940
- were true.
- That's not what I said.

11:18.964 --> 11:20.962
- I said I wasn't sure.
- See, that's a big difference.

11:20.995 --> 11:23.064
Well, the DNA test
was damn sure.

11:24.369 --> 11:26.435
You know, the funny thing
about DNA tests...

11:26.468 --> 11:27.907
Na-na-na-na. Look.

11:27.940 --> 11:30.339
Now we've all been on the road.

11:30.372 --> 11:33.411
You get back to the hotel...
Look, a man's going to be a man.

11:33.444 --> 11:36.451
And I'm just gonna
leave it at that.

11:36.517 --> 11:38.437
Well, you know, some men...
And that's all Dontel

11:38.452 --> 11:39.788
is gonna say about that.

11:39.821 --> 11:40.852
You wanted to say something,
Kenny.

11:40.885 --> 11:43.189
- No, that's it. That's good.
- Just...

11:43.222 --> 11:46.827
- OK, Dontel. But, Kenny?
- Not the man is also...

11:46.860 --> 11:49.129
- That's it. That's it.
- Different men can have...

11:49.162 --> 11:50.394
- That's it.
- He had a different spin on it.

11:50.459 --> 11:51.459
- No, he doesn't.
- A man gonna be a man.

11:51.500 --> 11:52.428
Yeah, a man gonna be a man.

11:52.468 --> 11:53.533
That's all Dontel
got to say about that.

11:53.566 --> 11:55.206
That's all Dontel gonna say.
That's Dontel.

11:55.239 --> 11:56.905
- Said that already.
- All right.

11:56.978 --> 11:57.977
Guess we're just gonna
leave it at that.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.681
All right, well, let's move on

11:59.714 --> 12:01.049
to our first hot topic.

12:01.082 --> 12:04.218
Major League Baseball is in
a little bit of hot water.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.331
I'm saying,
like, these guys...

12:36.090 --> 12:37.522
What do you
think about that, Kenny?

12:37.563 --> 12:39.162
Hmm? What's up?

12:39.195 --> 12:41.258
What are your thoughts on that?

12:43.129 --> 12:45.599
Hell yeah. Hell yeah.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.095
That's... hell yeah.
Of course.

12:47.136 --> 12:50.400
Oh, so you're saying Latino
players should get paid less?

12:50.433 --> 12:51.994
Is that what
you're saying, Kenny?

12:52.008 --> 12:53.807
You're saying Latino players
should get paid less?

12:53.840 --> 12:55.974
Uh, maybe you should go
to the next person...

12:56.039 --> 12:57.807
Na-na-na-na-na.
Na-na-na-na.

12:57.912 --> 12:59.753
You sat up here and told
our listening audience

12:59.775 --> 13:01.741
that Latino players
should not get paid.

13:03.781 --> 13:06.315
OK. Let's, let's
calm down on Kenny.

13:06.348 --> 13:07.947
You can tell he got
a old school mindset, right?

13:07.980 --> 13:09.485
I mean, you can tell
by the way he's rocking

13:09.550 --> 13:11.253
them Run DMC black Levi jeans.

13:12.853 --> 13:15.721
- Who's house?
- Run's house!

13:15.754 --> 13:19.786
That's really funny.

13:19.819 --> 13:20.785
I like that one.

13:23.491 --> 13:25.794
Oh baby.

13:25.827 --> 13:27.491
<i>Are those tassels,</i>
<i>or what is that?</i>

13:27.532 --> 13:30.129
<i>It's western, uh,</i>
<i>classic western cowboy fringe.</i>

13:30.162 --> 13:33.157
<i>- Whoo.</i>
<i>- Is that your best friend?</i>

13:34.493 --> 13:36.861
He was. Yes.

13:36.934 --> 13:39.700
Kenny Powers was my best friend.

13:39.733 --> 13:40.933
<i>If what you guys are saying...</i>

13:40.965 --> 13:42.203
<i>Hey, Elvis just called, he said</i>
<i>he wanted his suit back.</i>

13:46.105 --> 13:48.536
Guy. Guy, Guy, Guy.

13:48.609 --> 13:51.242
Hey, hey, hey. Yo, dude.

13:51.277 --> 13:53.180
Should we talk to your producer
or something.

13:53.213 --> 13:54.716
See about maybe booking me
on another appearance?

13:54.781 --> 13:57.548
Kenny...

13:57.589 --> 13:59.188
Seriously, you wanna
have this conversation?

13:59.253 --> 14:01.189
Sure. To... just of like
whether there's

14:01.222 --> 14:03.462
- an appropriate time to come back?
- Kenny.

14:03.527 --> 14:05.126
Were you at the same show
that I was at?

14:05.159 --> 14:06.429
No. You weren't.

14:06.462 --> 14:08.830
Because you were staring
up at the fucking lights.

14:08.863 --> 14:10.733
You were terrible out there.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.533
Dontel just walked
all over you.

14:12.566 --> 14:13.565
He took out his big fat dick

14:13.605 --> 14:15.266
and he started smacking you
in the face with it.

14:15.299 --> 14:16.936
Just smacking you
all in the face.

14:17.001 --> 14:18.768
Fucking smacking your nose.

14:18.801 --> 14:20.471
And fucking poking you
in the ears.

14:20.504 --> 14:22.209
And what do you do?
"Oh, I guess I have to get

14:22.242 --> 14:24.347
poked in the goddamn ear
by a big fat dick."

14:24.380 --> 14:26.011
Instead of going,
"Oh, maybe I should

14:26.044 --> 14:28.779
fucking tell him to fucking
get that dick outta my ear."

14:28.820 --> 14:29.883
Oh, OK. I think I see.

14:29.916 --> 14:31.683
So you just want me to be
a little maybe quicker

14:31.756 --> 14:33.451
on the uptake, maybe be
a little louder, project more?

14:33.484 --> 14:36.290
I want you to fucking
take Dontel down, man!

14:36.323 --> 14:38.793
He's turning the <i>Sesh</i>
<i>into a goddamn minstrel show.</i>

14:38.826 --> 14:41.931
Dancing around... a-ha-ha-ha.

14:41.964 --> 14:45.165
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah. God...
fucking dancing around

14:45.198 --> 14:46.867
like goddamn
Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

14:46.900 --> 14:48.233
Well, I didn't know
what was going on.

14:48.266 --> 14:49.936
I mean, a minstrel show, shit.

14:49.969 --> 14:51.600
- Well, I'm sorry.
- No. You know what?

14:51.634 --> 14:53.371
No, I'm sorry, Kenny.

14:53.476 --> 14:54.573
I just, I thought
you were something

14:54.614 --> 14:57.212
that you're not anymore
and I brought you in

14:57.245 --> 15:00.009
because I thought we can
level the playing field

15:00.082 --> 15:01.512
and I was wrong, man.

15:01.545 --> 15:04.215
- I bet on the wrong horse.
- No, you didn't, all right?

15:04.280 --> 15:05.679
I'm sorry I let you down, dog.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.881
But I am your horse, dude.
I'm the fucking right horse.

15:07.888 --> 15:09.255
You want me to take out Dontel?

15:09.288 --> 15:10.887
I'll assassinate
that motherfucker.

15:10.920 --> 15:13.119
I will fucking kill him on TV.

15:13.160 --> 15:17.699
Trust me. I got a fire in my
belly and I can fucking do this.

15:17.764 --> 15:19.329
You got a fire in your belly,
Kenny?

15:19.362 --> 15:21.032
Oh, it's burning so bright.

15:21.065 --> 15:22.799
Give me one more shot.

15:22.832 --> 15:25.997
All right. I'll give you
one more shot.

15:27.207 --> 15:28.376
Don't blow it, Kenny.

15:28.441 --> 15:30.144
I will blow nothing.

15:30.177 --> 15:32.308
Next time wear a suit.

15:38.614 --> 15:40.684
Go Toby!

15:41.885 --> 15:43.884
Kenny, you're missing the game.

15:43.917 --> 15:45.588
No, I'm seeing the game.

15:45.621 --> 15:47.420
Yeah.
Yeah, I see you, Toby.

15:47.453 --> 15:49.490
I see you blowing it.
Good job.

15:49.523 --> 15:50.657
I'm just hiding
of embarrassment.

15:50.690 --> 15:53.621
Hey, guys. Hey, you.

15:53.718 --> 15:54.789
How was the TV thing?

15:54.822 --> 15:56.389
You seemed so nervous,
I had to turn it off.

15:56.462 --> 15:57.989
Ain't nobody nervous.

15:58.030 --> 16:00.062
It was fine. Your breath smells
like sour cream and onion.

16:00.095 --> 16:01.996
Well, that's 'cause
I'm snacking on these chips.

16:02.061 --> 16:04.100
- You want any?
- No, gross.

16:04.133 --> 16:06.196
So Kenny, is this a real job

16:06.236 --> 16:07.899
or something
you're just doing for fun?

16:07.964 --> 16:10.831
No. I was invited
by Guy Young himself

16:10.864 --> 16:12.101
to appear
on his television show.

16:12.134 --> 16:14.034
- You were invited?
- Yes.

16:14.067 --> 16:15.561
Oh. I thought you won
a contest or something.

16:15.602 --> 16:16.898
I didn't see the beginning.

16:16.931 --> 16:17.835
Ain't nobody win no contest.

16:17.868 --> 16:20.035
There's too much estrogen
over here.

16:20.108 --> 16:22.199
I'm gonna go hang
with the men folk.

16:23.764 --> 16:25.299
Let's go, let's go.

16:25.340 --> 16:27.371
- Yes, yes, yes.
- "Yes, yes, yes."

16:27.404 --> 16:28.771
What's happening over here,
butt buddies?

16:28.804 --> 16:30.204
- How's it going, Ken?
- Hey, Kenny.

16:30.244 --> 16:31.611
Great job on the <i>Sesh.</i>

16:31.708 --> 16:33.346
- Congratulations, man.
- Good job.

16:33.379 --> 16:34.306
When's the Emmy?
When's the Emmy party?

16:34.347 --> 16:35.668
You gonna have us over
for drinks?

16:35.675 --> 16:37.050
What the hell's so funny?

16:37.083 --> 16:39.483
Why are you guys saying that
in a patronizing kind of way?

16:39.516 --> 16:41.557
Oh, no. I'm sorry. I thought
we were doing a thing.

16:41.590 --> 16:44.696
I thought you realized you...
It was a disaster.

16:45.962 --> 16:47.864
- Say what?
- You were terrible.

16:47.897 --> 16:49.798
OK. So terrible
that I guess Guy Young

16:49.831 --> 16:50.861
invited me back to do it again.

16:50.894 --> 16:51.964
So I guess I wasn't
too terrible.

16:51.997 --> 16:53.068
It was weird.

16:54.363 --> 16:57.202
Oh, gosh, April.
You seem so tense.

16:57.237 --> 16:59.004
I mean, is he looking
for other work?

16:59.037 --> 17:00.875
Is this affecting
you and the kids?

17:00.908 --> 17:02.042
Are you thinking about
leaving him?

17:02.075 --> 17:04.137
- No. No.
- No?

17:04.170 --> 17:06.869
No, no, no. I mean,
I'm trying to be supportive.

17:06.903 --> 17:09.204
You know, but I have
my reservations.

17:09.238 --> 17:13.013
Well, if you guys ever need a
place to crash away from him...

17:13.047 --> 17:14.151
You know, our house is too big.

17:14.184 --> 17:16.185
Dixie, it's not gonna
come to that.

17:16.219 --> 17:19.058
Well, you never know.
It's always a possibility.

17:19.090 --> 17:20.858
But it's not possible with us.

17:20.891 --> 17:23.128
So... We're gonna be just fine.

17:23.162 --> 17:24.394
Yes, it will be just great.

17:26.468 --> 17:28.868
You had that deer
in the headlights look.

17:28.901 --> 17:30.268
Oh, did I? What fucking channel
were you watching me on,

17:30.301 --> 17:31.804
motherfucker,
Bollywood Classics?

17:31.869 --> 17:34.107
Come on, man.
Just joking around.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.443
- Kind of a...
- You know what?

17:35.476 --> 17:36.442
I'm done with this, dude.

17:36.475 --> 17:37.674
I thought I was gonna
come over here

17:37.707 --> 17:39.811
and have some good camaraderie
with you dudes.

17:39.876 --> 17:42.584
Here's one dude who's fucking
going for the stars.

17:42.617 --> 17:43.922
Trying to make something
with his life.

17:43.987 --> 17:45.592
What do I get? I get
fucking hater shit, dude.

17:45.625 --> 17:48.086
I get fucking message board
fucking pettiness over here.

17:48.127 --> 17:50.924
I won't forget this. You guys
were not there to support me

17:50.957 --> 17:52.861
- in this time.
- Come on now.

17:52.926 --> 17:54.327
- Hey, Kenny.
- We're joking around.

17:54.368 --> 17:55.696
- Kenny. Come on now.
- Hey.

17:55.769 --> 17:56.768
You can't take a joke?

17:56.801 --> 17:58.566
No, I can take a joke.
That wasn't funny.

17:58.599 --> 18:00.366
- Kenny, come on.
- Come on.

18:00.399 --> 18:02.570
- Hey, Kenny.
- Hey, Ken, come on.

18:04.267 --> 18:07.738
I don't think that it's
too late to go back to Millenial

18:07.771 --> 18:09.305
and apologize to Mark.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.870
I think that he would give you
your job back.

18:11.904 --> 18:13.605
Trust me. Millenial's
off the table.

18:13.638 --> 18:15.742
- I can't fucking go back there.
- Don't shout.

18:15.775 --> 18:17.648
I'm not shouting,
I'm just explaining to you

18:17.681 --> 18:20.114
that I'm not gonna go back
to Millenial, all right?

18:20.154 --> 18:22.686
Once you punch your boss
in his face

18:22.719 --> 18:24.486
you don't usually
get your job back.

18:24.519 --> 18:26.655
My whole goddamn world's
in a free fall.

18:26.688 --> 18:29.192
I got to go back on the show
with these quick witted bullies

18:29.225 --> 18:31.191
and get fucking double peni'ed
on live television

18:31.224 --> 18:33.458
Stevie doesn't
even believe anymore.

18:33.491 --> 18:35.425
Now my own wife.

18:35.458 --> 18:38.296
My whole entire mystique
has all but fucking faded.

18:40.929 --> 18:42.431
Good night, Kenny.

18:47.999 --> 18:50.068
Good night, Kenny.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.609
Are you gonna go back on TV?

19:02.642 --> 19:03.945
I don't know.

19:03.978 --> 19:06.179
Your mom's been acting like
a real bitch about it.

19:06.220 --> 19:07.500
Maybe I'll just say fuck it all.

19:07.590 --> 19:09.821
Just stay back here
and practice on my moves.

19:09.854 --> 19:11.621
You still got it.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.461
Toby, go inside.

19:15.526 --> 19:16.397
Now.

19:16.430 --> 19:18.565
You motherfucker.

19:18.598 --> 19:20.198
What did I tell you
if I saw you again?

19:20.231 --> 19:21.470
I said I'd fucking destroy you!

19:21.503 --> 19:23.501
- Don't destroy me.
- I'll strike you!

19:23.534 --> 19:26.805
I surrender unto you.
I surrender unto you.

19:26.838 --> 19:28.805
Very well.
I shall show you mercy.

19:28.846 --> 19:30.078
Thank you.

19:30.111 --> 19:31.415
Why have you cometh to me?

19:31.480 --> 19:34.120
Well, I saw you on the <i>Sesh.</i>

19:34.153 --> 19:35.886
So you came here to gloat, huh?

19:35.919 --> 19:37.413
Kick me while I'm down?

19:37.454 --> 19:40.420
Well, go ahead.
Everybody else has.

19:41.357 --> 19:42.852
You got me thinking.

19:42.957 --> 19:44.722
I am a cunt.

19:44.756 --> 19:47.155
OK, my own kids
don't respect me.

19:47.228 --> 19:49.326
My wife no longer
sees me as a man

19:49.367 --> 19:52.369
and I am such a big pussy that
my dick can barely get hard.

19:52.402 --> 19:55.536
That's very big of you
to admit these things.

19:55.569 --> 19:58.910
You know, Kenny, they say
to the victor goes the spoils.

19:58.943 --> 20:00.839
Well, we fucking
conquered the universe.

20:00.879 --> 20:04.013
So where are our spoils?

20:04.046 --> 20:08.520
I say, if this fucked up world
doesn't give us what we deserve,

20:08.586 --> 20:11.586
we need to fucking take it.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.392
If we do this,

20:14.425 --> 20:16.789
it's gonna take a ton of blood,
sugar, sex and magic.

20:16.854 --> 20:20.726
The rewards will be great but
the shit ain't gonna be easy.

20:20.759 --> 20:25.337
Well, guess what, I can feel my
little dick getting hard already.

20:26.106 --> 20:27.104
Word.

20:27.137 --> 20:29.134
Well, let's get to work.

20:29.175 --> 20:31.069
You know what, don't feel bad
about not being able to get

20:31.102 --> 20:32.508
a hard dick from your wife.

20:32.541 --> 20:34.036
I couldn't get hard
off of her either.

20:34.077 --> 20:36.110
Well, that's nice of you to say.
Thank you.

20:36.143 --> 20:39.813
<i>Celebrity. The life</i>
<i>of an A-lister comes with</i>

20:39.846 --> 20:42.945
<i>a unique set of demands.</i>

20:42.978 --> 20:45.879
<i>And every celebrated person</i>
<i>needs a capable assistant.</i>

20:45.912 --> 20:48.478
- Fuck!
- Again.

20:48.519 --> 20:52.020
There. You see how he
straightened out his slacks?

20:52.085 --> 20:54.249
Two pats down.

20:54.282 --> 20:55.919
Again. Straighten those slacks.

20:55.953 --> 20:57.318
<i>The assistant</i>
<i>acts as the hands.</i>

20:57.351 --> 20:59.254
<i>The brain sends</i>

20:59.287 --> 21:00.222
Again.

21:00.256 --> 21:02.422
<i>...and the hands get it done.</i>

21:02.487 --> 21:04.189
- Again.
- It's too hard, man.

21:04.253 --> 21:05.355
It's not too hard.

21:05.388 --> 21:07.490
<i>Can a brain function</i>
<i>without hands? Yes.</i>

21:07.523 --> 21:09.156

21:13.394 --> 21:15.862
<i>But would it want to?</i>
<i>Fuck no.</i>

21:15.895 --> 21:17.664
So when that motherfucker
hits you the na-na-na,

21:17.729 --> 21:20.370
you got to come back
with a yeah-yeah-yeah.

21:20.402 --> 21:23.136
<i>After all, somebody's</i>
<i>got to carry the water,</i>

21:23.169 --> 21:24.606

Two pats, down!

21:51.911 --> 21:53.338
You're ready.

21:53.371 --> 21:55.073
There's just one more thing.

22:08.753 --> 22:10.120
Holy shit! Oh my God!

22:10.153 --> 22:12.549
I just spent 80 fucking
thousand dollars on a car.

22:12.582 --> 22:13.452
What the fuck am I thinking?

22:13.485 --> 22:16.416
Kenny, this Blue Book's
for 97,000.

22:16.481 --> 22:18.383
It was a steal.
Worst case scenario

22:18.416 --> 22:20.550
we torch the fucker
and collect the insurance.

22:23.455 --> 22:25.758
OK. Yeah, of course.
Yeah, you're right.

22:25.791 --> 22:26.662
Torch it. Fuck it.

22:54.188 --> 22:56.922
This is it, dog.
It's on now.

22:56.955 --> 22:59.417
Kenny Powers. Boy, you looking
like a new school player

22:59.458 --> 23:01.088
in that suit.

23:01.121 --> 23:02.718
But that's a bullshit
ass haircut.

23:04.053 --> 23:05.786
I can't do this, dude.
I got to get out of here, man.

23:05.819 --> 23:07.385
- This was a bad idea.
- What are you talking about?

23:07.419 --> 23:09.553
You got, you're ready.
You got these hot new clothes.

23:09.594 --> 23:10.521
No, we got to get out of here.
We got to get out of here.

23:10.562 --> 23:12.760
Oh, geez these lights,
they're so fucking hot.

23:12.793 --> 23:14.359
Kenny, no, no, no.
Don't do this.

23:14.392 --> 23:16.958
I'm just feeling anxiety, dude.
I'm having shortness of breath.

23:16.999 --> 23:18.564
These fucking lights
are beaming down on me.

23:18.597 --> 23:20.027
Don't go into
the light, Kenny.

23:20.060 --> 23:21.561
- Don't go into the light.
- The lights have me.

23:21.594 --> 23:23.589
- They're fucking lulling me in.
- Stay with me, Kenny.

23:23.630 --> 23:25.555
I smell burnt toast.

23:25.596 --> 23:27.690
Kenny.

23:28.529 --> 23:30.463
April.

23:30.496 --> 23:33.829
I came here to
wish you good luck.

23:33.862 --> 23:35.862
I didn't think
you believed in me.

23:35.895 --> 23:39.763
I never said that. I never
worried that you would fail.

23:39.797 --> 23:42.266
I only worried that
you would succeed.

23:42.299 --> 23:43.899
And I'm scared.

23:43.971 --> 23:46.602
I'm scared that I can't have
my husband, Kenny,

23:46.635 --> 23:50.405
and the famous Kenny
at the same time.

23:50.438 --> 23:52.307
And I don't want to lose you.

23:52.340 --> 23:54.108
I'm not going anywhere.

23:54.141 --> 23:56.939
You can have all the Kenny's
that there are Kenny's of.

23:56.972 --> 23:58.576
I love you.

23:58.609 --> 24:00.376
I'm just following my dream.

24:00.441 --> 24:01.945
I know that now.

24:01.978 --> 24:05.586
And if this is what
makes you happy...

24:05.619 --> 24:08.282
Well, then go fuck shit up.

24:09.123 --> 24:10.184
I intend to.

24:12.991 --> 24:14.823
All right, places everyone.

24:16.689 --> 24:18.562
Thanks for coming.

24:18.595 --> 24:21.234
I should also tell you that
I bought an $80,000 car.

24:22.802 --> 24:24.631
We'll talk about
it after the show.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.367
OK.

24:26.432 --> 24:28.270
We're live
in five, four,

24:28.335 --> 24:29.901
three...

24:31.699 --> 24:32.937
Yes, yes, y'all.

24:32.970 --> 24:34.367
You know what time it is.

24:34.401 --> 24:37.808
It's time for the <i>Sports Sesh.</i>

24:37.906 --> 24:41.912
And now, here's your host,
Guy Young.

24:41.945 --> 24:44.740
It's time. It's time.

24:44.773 --> 24:46.581
Come on, baby. Come on.

24:46.614 --> 24:48.078
Whoo!

24:50.817 --> 24:52.656
Whoo!

24:58.057 --> 25:00.927
Dontel, Dontel.

25:07.634 --> 25:09.705
That's my nigga,
that's my nigga.

25:11.507 --> 25:12.578
Do you like this kind of stuff?

25:12.611 --> 25:14.051
I just don't like this
kind of stuff.

25:14.076 --> 25:15.512
- I don't like this kind of stuff.
- Kenny Powers.

25:15.545 --> 25:17.277
- Whoo!
- That was ugly, Dontel.

25:17.310 --> 25:19.275
Wow, that was embarrassing.

25:19.308 --> 25:22.748
Kenny had a block party
and invited Dontel.

25:22.813 --> 25:24.548
Welcome back to another
session of <i>Sports Sesh.</i>

25:24.581 --> 25:26.947
I'm Guy Young and these
guys are just guys.

25:27.020 --> 25:29.419
Now I want to just
jump right into hot topics.

25:29.452 --> 25:32.618
Ricky Parks just left Orlando for
a big contract with the Knicks.

25:32.659 --> 25:34.322
Cool move or fool move.

25:34.355 --> 25:36.722
- Cool move.
- Fool, fool move, man.

25:36.763 --> 25:38.530
- Why's that?
- Those fans in Orlando,

25:38.563 --> 25:41.528
they worship that guy.
Whatever happened to loyalty?

25:41.594 --> 25:42.832
Well, I got to disagree
with you, Dontel.

25:42.865 --> 25:45.064
I don't care what you think.
Alright. Now look,

25:45.097 --> 25:48.535
when I played, I had a rapport
with the local fan base.

25:48.568 --> 25:50.302
It's not always about the money,
gentleman.

25:50.335 --> 25:52.535
Well, if it's not about the money then
why didn't you play for free, dog?

25:52.575 --> 25:54.543
Oh!

25:54.576 --> 25:55.744
Say yeah-yeah-yeah.

25:55.777 --> 25:58.079
He makes a good
point there, Dontel.

25:58.112 --> 25:59.982
- You made a lot of money.
- A lot.

26:00.047 --> 26:01.675
I mean, let's face facts, guys.

26:01.708 --> 26:03.515
Playing sports is after all,
a business.

26:03.548 --> 26:07.287
And the way I see it, this dude saw a
chance to get paid and he took it.

26:07.320 --> 26:10.928
Ain't nothing wrong with that. You know, I
played for over 10 teams and do you know why?

26:10.961 --> 26:14.063
Because those were the teams that were
willing to pay me the most money.

26:14.096 --> 26:17.199
<i>- I play to get paid.</i>
<i>- That's the American way.</i>

26:17.264 --> 26:20.030
<i>- Get that wallet stacked.</i>
<i>- Na-na-na-na-na.</i>

26:20.063 --> 26:21.743
<i>- Yeah-yeah-yeah, Dontel.</i>
<i>- Back the up.</i>

26:24.668 --> 26:27.135
Goddamn fangs, looking like a
motherfucking extra from <i>Blade.</i>

26:27.167 --> 26:31.768
Look at this dude, looking like,
like dude from "Achy Breaky Heart".

26:31.809 --> 26:33.775
Oh we want to talk about hair? Let's
talk about hair for a second, shall we?

26:33.808 --> 26:36.371
Let's talk about that bald ass
shiny head of yours?

26:36.404 --> 26:37.642
Looking like black Destro.

26:37.675 --> 26:40.009
Honestly, this motherfucker
looks like a Milk Dud.

26:40.042 --> 26:42.476
Oh! A Milk Dud.

26:42.517 --> 26:45.287
Na-na. Na-na-na-na.

26:45.352 --> 26:47.549
Why I got to be a Milk Dud?
Because I'm black?

26:47.582 --> 26:49.754
Na-na-na. You don't have to be a Milk Dud.
You could be Tic Tacs

26:49.787 --> 26:51.081
the way your goddamn
breath's kicking.

26:51.122 --> 26:53.283
Smell like you been chewing on
buttholes all afternoon.

26:55.257 --> 26:57.760
Diarrhea buttholes.

26:57.793 --> 26:59.960
- Diarrhea stinky buttholes.
- What y'all laughing at?

27:00.057 --> 27:02.792
That's right, Kenny.
Fuck him in the ass.

27:02.833 --> 27:04.864
What y'all laughing at?

27:04.898 --> 27:06.865
Watch out, audience. This
motherfucker about to stink you up.

27:06.898 --> 27:09.364
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

27:09.397 --> 27:11.604
Oh, you want to
see a nigga, huh?

27:11.637 --> 27:14.503
You want to see a nigga,
I will show you a nigga.

27:14.576 --> 27:16.809
I prefer not to see one today.

27:16.842 --> 27:19.312
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Holy shit!

27:19.345 --> 27:21.617
OK. Everybody calm down.

27:23.955 --> 27:25.525
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:25.558 --> 27:28.095
Get off me. You know what?

27:28.128 --> 27:30.096
You know what,
Guy? Man, fuck you.

27:30.129 --> 27:32.134
- Oh!
- Fuck these losers.

27:32.166 --> 27:34.532
Fuck those assholes out there.

27:37.132 --> 27:38.699
All right,
we will be right back...

27:38.732 --> 27:41.068
I'm out of this motherfucker.

27:41.108 --> 27:43.308
- Out of here. Out of here.
- Out of here.

27:43.341 --> 27:45.978
Get a toothbrush, homes.

27:46.011 --> 27:47.840
All right, we're going
to be right back.

27:47.873 --> 27:50.878
And when we get back, we're going to
have some more Kenny f'ing Powers.

27:50.911 --> 27:53.379
Whoo! Give it up for Kenny.
