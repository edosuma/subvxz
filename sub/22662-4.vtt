20:44.440 --> 20:45.805
You also shot a copper.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.724
Shot in the arm, with purpose.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.211
There's a copper on the floor,

20:50.280 --> 20:52.601
the Stratford Constabulary
will swarm all over it.

20:54.280 --> 20:58.490
The copper's alive,
got a description of the Italians.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.801
The Italians will be
forced underground.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.962
We're Gypsies.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.804
We're already underground.

21:10.960 --> 21:14.169
ABERAMA: You yourself inflicted
no casualties this end, so...

21:16.520 --> 21:19.285
You know, Mr Shelby,

21:20.000 --> 21:23.129
maybe you've been pushing
pieces of paper around too long.

21:24.640 --> 21:27.405
Luca Changretta got away.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.528
You let him get away.

21:29.600 --> 21:33.366
When our paths cross,
I won't be so careless.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.401
And when will your paths cross?

21:38.240 --> 21:39.810
Soon.

22:19.360 --> 22:21.249
If Her Majesty smells of paraffin,

22:21.320 --> 22:24.051
it's because my old lamp is smoking
for want of fuel.

22:24.880 --> 22:26.928
Times are hard,
in case you hadn't noticed.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.606
I hope your insistence
that I take a boat

22:29.680 --> 22:33.287
rather than a cab from the station
wasn't purely for your own amusement.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.931
No. For the avoidance
of death or kidnap.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.571
And by boat, you get to see
the nicer parts of a city.

22:38.640 --> 22:41.007
You're in the Garrison now,
so you'll be all right.

22:41.080 --> 22:42.445
This way.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.928
Good morning, Lady Carleton.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.490
I'm not a lady.

22:50.240 --> 22:51.890
Too right you're not.

22:53.800 --> 22:57.566
For shoeing, stabling, feed,
and two hours a day in the gallops.

22:58.720 --> 23:00.882
Did you think of a name?

23:00.960 --> 23:02.564
Yes. "Dangerous."

23:04.840 --> 23:06.205
Dangerous, eh?

23:06.280 --> 23:09.409
A horse called Dangerous
won the Epsom Derby in 1833,

23:09.480 --> 23:11.005
so I stole the name.

23:11.080 --> 23:12.605
I thought you'd approve.

23:14.920 --> 23:16.251
You should visit her.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.448
If I leave Small Heath,
I'll be shot dead.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.004
Anyway, I'm bUSY-

23:21.080 --> 23:22.411
Well, the good news is,

23:22.480 --> 23:25.290
your horse is the fastest filly
that I've ever ridden.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.764
These are her registration papers.

23:29.520 --> 23:31.170
Ready for your signature.

23:38.160 --> 23:39.764
So is this why you came here?

23:41.080 --> 23:42.923
All this way, in person?

23:44.840 --> 23:46.490
For my fucking signature?

23:51.280 --> 23:56.286
You've lost your wife,
and now your brother too.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.922
I thought it would make you different,

24:03.240 --> 24:05.641
but it doesn't seem to change you.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.449
Nothing seems to change you.

signed off on those, Lizzie.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.330

24:22.680 --> 24:24.762
He's having them made in London.
I'm not sure about them.

24:24.840 --> 24:26.285
All right, Lizzie, thank you.

24:26.400 --> 24:29.847
But you know, sometimes he sees
something glamorous and expensive,

24:29.920 --> 24:31.729
he just can't resist it.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.040
He's so weak.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.641
Actually, speaking of the
Grace Shelby Foundation,

24:38.760 --> 24:40.683
I'd like to make a donation.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.811
(MAY CLEARS THROAT)

24:43.960 --> 24:45.485
I'll leave it blank.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.042
You can decide how much, Mr Shelby.

24:51.680 --> 24:54.684
Then perhaps... Lizzie?

24:55.640 --> 24:58.689
...can pop to the bank
and pay it in for me.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.249
That'll be all, Lizzie, thank you.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.125
No, thank you.

25:22.760 --> 25:24.649

25:27.360 --> 25:28.646
No.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.522
(CLICKS TONGUE) Pity.

25:32.320 --> 25:33.765
Why?

25:33.840 --> 25:36.286
Well, because 25 minutes ago,

25:36.360 --> 25:39.330
the Birmingham branch
of the train drivers' union

25:39.440 --> 25:42.922
called a wildcat strike
in support of the coal miners.

25:44.120 --> 25:46.009
No trains to London until tomorrow.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.689
It wasn't in any of the papers.

25:48.760 --> 25:50.603
That's why they call it a wildcat.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.286
No one knows.

25:52.360 --> 25:54.203
Apart from you, of course.

25:54.280 --> 25:55.645
Your city.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.921
So where will I stay in your city?

26:00.560 --> 26:02.688
I'll be free at 4:00.
I could meet you then.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.811
Meet and do what?

26:08.440 --> 26:13.844
I will pour you some gin
that I make myself,

26:13.920 --> 26:16.048
from my father's recipe.

26:16.120 --> 26:20.170
Distilled for the eradication
of seemingly incurable sadness.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.009
I'm going to put that on the label.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.445
I'll book myself a room.

26:24.960 --> 26:28.169
Already done. The Midland. Suite.

26:28.240 --> 26:29.765
I stay there myself sometimes.

26:29.960 --> 26:31.803
Sometimes, it's where you stay.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.282
But not tonight, it would seem.

26:42.080 --> 26:45.243
Well, since I'm stuck here,
maybe I should try your gin.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.206
4:00 then.
- Where?

26:55.080 --> 26:56.491
I'll find you.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.801
What the fuck
was that about, Lizzie? Eh?

27:06.280 --> 27:07.645
Have a guess.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.570
You know what,
I can't even guess any more.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.130
I'll be back at 4:00.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.211
Why is she still here?

27:13.600 --> 27:15.728

with the coal miners, apparently.

- Fucking what?
- Fucking her.

28:37.520 --> 28:38.885
Ten thousand pounds?

28:38.960 --> 28:41.167
She left it blank,
so I filled it in for her.

33:22.360 --> 33:23.850
do you have any boots
that I could borrow?

33:23.920 --> 33:25.684
Why do you need boots?

33:25.760 --> 33:27.285
Well, no one here will speak to me,

by the canal.

of armed men in the Small Heath area.

at the Summer Lane hospital.

on the Stratford Road.

What is this, a hobby?

37:17.840 --> 37:20.650
No. I don't really have time
for hobbies.

37:21.760 --> 37:23.410
This is more of a...

37:24.920 --> 37:27.127
More of a place
where I try things out.

37:29.240 --> 37:32.289
I've decided, if I'm gonna be
stuck here in Small Heath,

37:33.000 --> 37:34.843
I might as well do something useful.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.804
Less of a hobby.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.530
More of a venture.

37:45.720 --> 37:47.324
Since the start of prohibition,

37:47.400 --> 37:52.531
I've been sending
single malt Scotch whisky to Boston,

37:52.600 --> 37:56.889
to Halifax, Nova Scotia,
hidden in crates of car parts.

37:56.960 --> 37:58.200
(CHUCKLES)

37:58.680 --> 38:01.604
But my supply lines from Scotland
have been unreliable.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.011
There's been a lot of thefts.

38:03.800 --> 38:08.249
And in this modern age, American women
drink as much booze as the men.

38:08.840 --> 38:12.242
And women, apparently, prefer gin.

38:14.080 --> 38:17.050
So with the help of a friend of mine
in Camden Town,

38:17.120 --> 38:19.168
I've set up my own source of supply.

38:19.920 --> 38:24.482
Junipers, potatoes, sugar and water,

38:25.000 --> 38:26.604
all turned into US dollars.

38:29.960 --> 38:33.726
When we're up and running,
we'll produce over 200 gallons a week.

38:36.720 --> 38:41.601
But before then,
I need to get my recipe right.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.729
So tell me the truth.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.323
- The truth?
- Mmm-hmm.

39:05.400 --> 39:07.482
You're unlike any man I've ever met.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.731
- And the gin?
- Too sweet.

39:33.360 --> 39:34.805
You said you'd booked a room.

39:35.720 --> 39:37.404
No, I booked a suite.

39:40.240 --> 39:41.765
Thank you.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.050
If you book a taxi, I'll go.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.768
You're a businessman, Tommy.
A good one.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.526
- If only you could...
- If only I could what?

39:56.640 --> 39:58.529
If only you could change?

39:58.600 --> 40:01.843
Go on, say it.
If only you could change the bad.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.487
And "the good" is laying off
a thousand men, which I do.

40:05.920 --> 40:09.447
Like a good businessman,
and I do it like that. (SNAPS FINGERS)

40:10.360 --> 40:11.964
And people go hungry.

40:12.280 --> 40:16.365
And the bad, the bad's
a fucking win on the horses

40:16.440 --> 40:20.047
and a gun
and some fucking self-respect.

40:21.240 --> 40:23.004
You fucking people...

40:28.240 --> 40:29.969
You bite like your horse.

40:35.080 --> 40:37.003
I don't trust taxis any more.

40:38.160 --> 40:39.730
Come with me.

40:49.160 --> 40:50.889
ARTHUR: There we go, brother.

40:52.320 --> 40:54.084
Home sweet home.

40:54.760 --> 40:58.560
A place for you to bring women back,
bring your mates.

40:58.640 --> 41:01.325
Play games, gamble, cards,

41:01.440 --> 41:04.603
and you keep an eye on our backyard.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.562
It's Artillery Square, the place
is full of communists and strikers.

41:11.360 --> 41:13.522
Having a Shelby round here
will keep them in order.

41:16.080 --> 41:19.801
Light the fucking fire.
Take some of this shit off the walls.

41:20.160 --> 41:23.562
Curly'll be over later
with some poison for the rats.

41:23.880 --> 41:25.689
- Arthur?
- Huh?

41:26.360 --> 41:31.605
This morning, I wouldn't
have been able to pull that trigger.

41:32.040 --> 41:35.249
I know I wouldn't.
They would have just walked past.

41:36.600 --> 41:38.125

41:39.440 --> 41:41.044
- I know I'm not.
- All right.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.080
All right, brother.

41:46.600 --> 41:48.011
I know you're not.

41:48.760 --> 41:50.125
I know.

41:51.400 --> 41:55.928
In the end, it's God who pulls
that fucking trigger anyway.

41:56.920 --> 42:01.289
We don't get to decide
who lives and who dies, Finn.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.445
Not us.

42:06.120 --> 42:11.524
You just have to flick a switch
in your head.

42:30.600 --> 42:33.285
Charlie said it wasn't safe
to walk by the canal.

42:33.360 --> 42:34.930
And he's right.

42:35.760 --> 42:38.411
Italians north and south, he said.

42:39.120 --> 42:41.851
No, it's mostly chancers.

They all know we're on the ropes.

42:52.680 --> 42:55.843
- And that's not including the mafia.
- Yup.

42:55.920 --> 42:57.365
Here's your carriage.

42:57.440 --> 42:59.602
You can catch the 7:15 train.

43:00.040 --> 43:02.042
I thought there was a strike.

43:02.120 --> 43:03.645
What gave you that idea?

43:04.960 --> 43:06.325
My God.

43:07.480 --> 43:09.050
I know.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.724
The bad I can't help.

43:11.680 --> 43:13.887
I wanted you to stay.

43:13.960 --> 43:15.883
And normally, I get my own way.

43:17.320 --> 43:19.800
Losing occasionally makes me worse.

43:29.840 --> 43:31.490
MAY: Thank you, Curly.

43:32.720 --> 43:35.610
She looks a picture in my boots,
doesn't she, Tom?

43:35.680 --> 43:38.251
- Walk her to the train, Curly.
- Yeah.

this talk of tightening our belts
must be met with a resolute certainty.

43:51.520 --> 43:53.363
We will not accept any cuts in pay.

We will not accept working

don't allow unaccompanied

45:21.400 --> 45:23.004
I'm afraid we don't have ice.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.287
Next time, make sure you have ice.

to terrify people.

45:52.880 --> 45:54.325

- To sit down with you and talk.

If he withdraws his pay cut,
we have no need to talk.

he thinks we are among

Where are the Sicilians?

51:45.200 --> 51:50.206
They're still using Sabini
for vehicles and for places to stay.

51:50.280 --> 51:51.520
Mmm-hmm. And reinforcements?

51:51.600 --> 51:53.284
Ah, they know the Sicilians,
don't they?

51:53.360 --> 51:55.840
They don't trust nobody who ain't
fucked a goat on the morning

51:55.920 --> 51:58.241
of their first pubic hair.
They've got traditions.

51:59.280 --> 52:01.521
- How many are here?
- Eleven.

52:02.160 --> 52:05.050
Enough to drop a man
who wrapped his balls in an OBE,

52:05.120 --> 52:06.610
till they fell off.

52:08.760 --> 52:11.240
Well, the real question is, Alfie,

52:12.280 --> 52:13.645
which side are you playing for, eh?

52:13.840 --> 52:17.049
(CH UCKLES) Fucking hell.

52:17.760 --> 52:19.683
What kind of world is it
to bring up children

52:19.760 --> 52:22.650
when your own mate
can ask you that question, eh?

52:23.000 --> 52:24.365
But the truth is, Tommy,

52:24.440 --> 52:26.010
you're going to be
fucking dead soon, yeah.

52:26.080 --> 52:28.128
Then your starlings, right,

52:28.200 --> 52:30.362
they will peck out
your blue eyes, won't they?

52:30.520 --> 52:34.002
And the jackdaws, they will steal
your gold and your medals

52:34.080 --> 52:35.161
and pretty soon it'll be as if

52:35.240 --> 52:37.481
it never even
fucking happened, mate.

52:37.560 --> 52:38.925
Tommy, there are men approaching.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.525
Yeah, let 'em pass.

52:41.560 --> 52:44.769
Right. You tell Darby Sabini from me,

52:44.840 --> 52:47.446
that if the Italians win,
they're not planning on leaving.

52:47.560 --> 52:51.121
And after me, it'll be him,
and then you, then the Titanic.

52:51.480 --> 52:53.562
They're the fucking mafia, Alfie.

52:53.640 --> 52:56.405
They've come here and can't believe
our coppers are unarmed.

52:56.480 --> 52:59.131
They can distil their liquor
and it's against the law.

52:59.200 --> 53:01.407
They've come here
and they like what they see.

53:01.480 --> 53:03.687
They're coming
and they're here to stay.

53:03.760 --> 53:05.250
ABERAMA: Mr Shelby?

53:06.240 --> 53:08.527
We've come to talk purse
for the fight.

53:08.600 --> 53:10.090
Your kestre I?

53:11.360 --> 53:13.601
Tommy, when a pikey walks in
with hair like that,

53:13.680 --> 53:15.682
you've gotta ask yourself,
"Have I made a mistake?"

53:15.800 --> 53:17.689
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck am I?

53:17.760 --> 53:21.162
- Who the fuck is this?
- I, my friend,

53:21.680 --> 53:23.045
I am the uncle,

53:23.120 --> 53:26.203
I'm the protector
and the promoter,

53:26.280 --> 53:29.090
of that fucking thing right there
in whose shadow

53:29.160 --> 53:32.448
nothing good nor godly
will ever fucking grow.

53:32.520 --> 53:36.764
That there, right, is the Southern
Counties welterweight champion.

53:37.040 --> 53:39.407
He is of mixed religion,
therefore he is godless,

53:39.480 --> 53:41.403
he was adopted by Satan himself,

53:41.480 --> 53:43.960
before he was returned
out of fear of his awkwardness.

53:44.080 --> 53:47.084
He is impossible to marry off
due to his lethal dimensions,

53:47.160 --> 53:49.845
his mother terrified,
she's fucking abandoned him.

53:49.920 --> 53:51.968
And there he is stood before you

53:52.040 --> 53:55.089
like the first of some
brand new fucking species.

53:59.480 --> 54:01.289
Any man that you put before him,

54:01.360 --> 54:04.489
right, it'd be like entering
a fucking threshing machine, mate.

54:06.520 --> 54:09.490
Now, will you offer your son?

54:18.360 --> 54:20.249
Name the day, Mr Shelby.

55:03.280 --> 55:05.203
That's me finished
for the weekend, Tommy?

55:05.280 --> 55:09.171
Yeah. Your mother wants me to go
to the Foundation... Prize giving.

55:11.840 --> 55:13.285
Just yQU?

55:15.160 --> 55:16.730
Just me.

55:17.960 --> 55:19.325
Why?

55:19.560 --> 55:21.050
No reason.

55:21.160 --> 55:22.400
No reason.

55:23.840 --> 55:25.330
No reason.

55:28.600 --> 55:30.170
Bye, Michael.

55:32.280 --> 55:33.361
Tommy?

55:36.320 --> 55:37.890
Yeah?

55:41.520 --> 55:43.329
Have a good weekend.

55:56.760 --> 56:01.402
<i># You have forsaken
all the love you've taken</i>

56:01.480 --> 56:06.486

56:06.560 --> 56:11.521
<i># Your body's aching,

56:11.600 --> 56:16.686

it just keeps holdin' on</i>

56:36.560 --> 56:40.884

there's nowhere left to fall #</i>

57:15.720 --> 57:20.089

comes a tall handsome man</i>

57:20.200 --> 57:24.683

with a red right hand #</i>
