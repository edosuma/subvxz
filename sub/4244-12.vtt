put it up on the Internet yet?

about that.

Off the record.

12:28.207 --> 12:31.126
Sure.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.692
I thought you hated her.

12:57.528 --> 12:59.112
I thought so, too.

12:59.196 --> 13:02.324
But she's the only
mother I have.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.744
So she turns on the charm, and
you're ready to forgive her?

13:05.827 --> 13:08.664
Not forgive her...
exactly.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.040
She walked out on us.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.668
What kind of person
does that?

13:12.751 --> 13:15.254
Well... you.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.967
No. No, that is not
the same thing.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.677
-It's not?
-I was always coming back,

13:21.760 --> 13:24.346
I was in touch,
and I had reasons.

13:24.429 --> 13:26.348
I'm sure
she had a reason.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.642
We know the reason.

13:35.524 --> 13:37.568
It's just too
much, you know?

13:37.651 --> 13:40.195
I'm...

13:40.279 --> 13:41.697
I'm sick about Dad.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.198
Islamabad was
a mind fuck.

13:43.282 --> 13:46.785
I can't deal
with her, too.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.412
We don't even know
where she is.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.455
She didn't leave
a number?

13:50.539 --> 13:52.457
When would she have
left a number?

13:52.541 --> 13:55.169
You had a fucking
pitchfork out.

14:04.261 --> 14:09.266
He had to have popcorn, soda
and Sno-Caps at the movies.

14:09.349 --> 14:13.312
Jigsaw puzzles
no less than 3,000 pieces.

14:13.395 --> 14:16.148
And watching
every single Orioles game,

14:16.231 --> 14:18.525
yelling at them to
"stop stinking up the diamond."

14:18.609 --> 14:21.111
(quiet laughter)

14:25.324 --> 14:28.243
These were some of
Dad's favorite things.

14:31.246 --> 14:34.917
Extremes, of course,
because...

14:35.000 --> 14:38.045
because that's who he was.

14:38.128 --> 14:41.256
He loved me and my sister
like that.

14:41.340 --> 14:43.300
Like crazy.

14:49.640 --> 14:52.851
He had demons--
everyone here knows that--

14:52.935 --> 14:55.979
but... he lived with them.

14:56.063 --> 14:59.399
And he taught me
how to live with them.

15:03.946 --> 15:07.866
This past year,
he helped me with my daughter.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.661
He took care of her.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.955
He loved her with that same...

15:13.038 --> 15:17.125
crazy love when I couldn't.

15:19.086 --> 15:23.090
I don't think Franny
will remember him.

15:23.173 --> 15:25.759
But I'm taking over now, Dad.

15:29.263 --> 15:32.391
And I'll remember for her.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.775
PASTOR:
If everyone could please turn

15:41.859 --> 15:44.570
to page 48 in their hymnals.

15:45.404 --> 15:47.614
(bell tolling)

15:53.036 --> 15:54.580
Hi.

15:56.248 --> 15:58.292
-Hey.
-(talks quietly)

15:58.375 --> 16:00.586
(quiet chatter continues)

16:09.261 --> 16:12.222
Excuse me. Excuse me.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.227
Oh, thank God.

16:17.311 --> 16:18.979
Thank God.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.272
Hey.

16:20.355 --> 16:21.732
(crying softly)

16:22.524 --> 16:23.859
(whispers):
Hey.

16:23.942 --> 16:26.236
God, I was so
worried about you.

16:26.320 --> 16:29.281
Things were worrisome
there for a while.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.079
-You okay?
-(sighs)

16:37.915 --> 16:40.209
Yeah.

16:45.631 --> 16:48.217
How did you get
out of there?

16:48.300 --> 16:52.179
German intelligence
was helpful.

16:52.262 --> 16:53.388
Astrid?

16:53.472 --> 16:55.390
Yeah.

16:55.474 --> 16:57.809
I hid out for a while, hoping
for another chance at Haqqani,

16:57.893 --> 16:59.269
but he was gone.

16:59.353 --> 17:01.230
I'm not sorry, Quinn.

17:01.313 --> 17:03.482
Yeah, I get that.

17:06.527 --> 17:08.445
I had a chance at him, too.

17:08.529 --> 17:09.988
Right after.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.365
He stood up

17:11.448 --> 17:14.660
out of the sunroof suddenly,
waving to the crowd.

17:14.743 --> 17:17.621
I was moving on him, but...

17:17.704 --> 17:19.248
Khan stopped me.

17:19.331 --> 17:21.416
Jesus, Carrie.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.460
Now you know how I felt.

17:24.753 --> 17:27.464
Yeah, well, anyway,
that's all over now.

17:29.550 --> 17:30.884
Hopefully.

17:30.968 --> 17:33.262
What's that mean?

17:33.345 --> 17:35.722
Dar Adal came looking for you.

17:35.806 --> 17:37.349
-When?
-Yesterday.

17:37.432 --> 17:38.600
Any idea why?

17:38.684 --> 17:41.395
He didn't say.

17:41.478 --> 17:44.314
Personally, I'd stay away
from that motherfucker.

17:45.399 --> 17:48.443
Oh, I plan to.

17:48.527 --> 17:50.696
Good.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.412
(quiet chatter)

17:58.495 --> 18:01.248
Who knew Dad had
so many friends?

18:01.331 --> 18:03.458
(chuckles)

18:03.542 --> 18:05.419
(sighs)

18:05.502 --> 18:06.545
Who's that?

18:06.628 --> 18:08.463
Oh, he's one of mine,
from work.

18:08.547 --> 18:09.965
Quinn.

18:10.048 --> 18:12.342
Don't think I ever heard you
mention him before.

18:12.426 --> 18:14.344
Mm, I don't think
I ever have.

18:14.428 --> 18:17.181
Well, he and Franny seem
to have hit it off.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.690
Can I borrow him for a minute?

18:26.773 --> 18:28.984
Course.

18:37.409 --> 18:39.328
What'd you find out?

18:39.411 --> 18:41.538
Crocker swears up and down

18:41.622 --> 18:44.124
there was no engagement
with Islamabad of any kind.

18:44.208 --> 18:46.376
What about an
overture to Haqqani?

18:46.460 --> 18:48.170
He calls that "unthinkable."

18:48.253 --> 18:49.463
"Political suicide."

18:49.546 --> 18:51.757
How does he explain Dar Adal
on the ground, then?

18:51.840 --> 18:53.300
-He doesn't.
-What do you mean?

18:53.383 --> 18:54.801
I mentioned no names.

18:54.885 --> 18:57.471
For now, you and me are
as big as this club gets, okay?

18:57.554 --> 18:59.389
-Okay.
-Not even Quinn.

18:59.473 --> 19:02.768
(exhales) He'd go
ballistic if he knew.

19:02.851 --> 19:04.937
Absolutely sure it was
Dar Adal in that car?

19:05.020 --> 19:06.772
It was him, all right.

19:06.855 --> 19:07.940
Okay.

19:08.023 --> 19:09.691
I'll do some more digging.

19:09.775 --> 19:11.193
QUINN:
Am I interrupting?

19:11.276 --> 19:12.402
No.

19:12.486 --> 19:14.154
-Not at all.
-How'd your dad feel

19:14.238 --> 19:15.739
about Irish whiskey?

19:15.822 --> 19:17.908
Nice.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.326
(laughter)

19:19.409 --> 19:20.410
I mean, I'm learning

19:20.494 --> 19:22.538
so much about my dad
that I never knew.

19:22.621 --> 19:24.540
Like what?

19:24.623 --> 19:27.125
Like he was arrested on the
Mall, protesting the Iraq War.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.377
<i>Six </i>times.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.587
SAUL:
I seem to recall that.

19:30.671 --> 19:32.130
You do?

19:32.214 --> 19:34.842
All his letters were
forwarded to me. Remember?

19:34.925 --> 19:36.635
-What letters?
-Hundreds he wrote

19:36.718 --> 19:41.557
to George Tenet, demanding you
be reassigned home from Baghdad.

19:42.641 --> 19:43.976
You never told me that.

19:44.059 --> 19:45.143
LOCKHART:
Hello, all.

19:45.227 --> 19:47.604
Hey. Look who's
a nice guy.

19:47.688 --> 19:49.189
I would have come earlier.

19:49.273 --> 19:52.359
I was in a marathon meeting
with my lawyers.

19:52.442 --> 19:53.610
That's fun.

19:53.694 --> 19:55.529
Barrel of monkeys.

19:55.612 --> 19:58.198
Anyway...

19:58.282 --> 20:00.617
my wife made a lasagna.

20:02.536 --> 20:04.997
I know-- who wants lasagna
at 10:00 at night?

20:05.080 --> 20:06.415
I do. (chuckles)

20:06.498 --> 20:07.541
Thanks.

20:07.624 --> 20:10.085
Well...

20:10.169 --> 20:12.212
Sorry about your dad.

20:12.296 --> 20:14.298
Hey, join us.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.591
Yeah, take a chair.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.052
Okay.

20:19.136 --> 20:20.596
Whiskey?

20:20.679 --> 20:22.472
I would love a beer.

20:22.556 --> 20:24.683
Oh, there's
some inside.

20:24.766 --> 20:27.769
Forget it.
I'll have what you're having.

20:31.315 --> 20:34.484
Thanks.

20:34.568 --> 20:36.445
-Cheers, everybody.
-Cheers.

20:36.528 --> 20:38.989
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

20:47.497 --> 20:49.458
I'm gonna go check
on Franny.

20:52.544 --> 20:55.797
So... that's done.

20:55.881 --> 20:57.466
Tired?

20:57.549 --> 20:59.468
Yeah, wrung out.

21:02.763 --> 21:04.515
Were you there, too?

21:04.598 --> 21:06.225
Pakistan? Yeah.

21:06.308 --> 21:09.102
I've never seen Carrie
so thrown after a job.

21:09.937 --> 21:12.689
A lot went wrong.

21:21.782 --> 21:23.200
(Franny giggles)

21:24.993 --> 21:27.287
Hi, sweet girl.

21:27.371 --> 21:28.956
(giggles)

21:50.644 --> 21:51.645
Everything okay?

21:51.728 --> 21:53.355
Yeah, I NyQuil'd her.

21:53.438 --> 21:55.524
Just kidding.
She's fine.

21:56.567 --> 21:58.277
Ready?

21:58.360 --> 21:59.611
Ready.

21:59.695 --> 22:00.863
CARRIE:
I'll be right back.

22:00.946 --> 22:02.573
Well, it was nice meeting you.

22:02.656 --> 22:04.992
Nice to meet you.

22:18.755 --> 22:21.133
Franny took a
shine to you.

22:21.216 --> 22:23.719
(chuckles):
Yeah. We made friends.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.639
You've been quiet.

22:27.723 --> 22:29.766
Thinking.

22:29.850 --> 22:31.768
About?

22:31.852 --> 22:33.729
This.

22:33.812 --> 22:35.689
What do you mean?

22:35.772 --> 22:37.774
Being home.

22:37.858 --> 22:39.776
Being away from all that.

22:39.860 --> 22:41.737
Yeah.

22:41.820 --> 22:43.572
Normal life.

22:43.655 --> 22:45.782
Yeah.

22:45.866 --> 22:47.534
Feels good.

22:47.618 --> 22:51.747
Just... laughing,
you know?

22:51.830 --> 22:53.373
Yeah.

22:53.457 --> 22:55.709
Tonight was fun.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.920
God, is that awful?

22:58.003 --> 23:00.756
No. Not at all.

23:00.839 --> 23:03.717
It was sad, but...

23:03.800 --> 23:05.677
fun.

23:35.707 --> 23:37.376
(exhales)

23:39.878 --> 23:41.797
Quinn, I'll just fuck it up.

23:41.880 --> 23:42.923
No, you won't.

23:43.006 --> 23:44.174
I will.

23:44.258 --> 23:46.635
I do.

23:49.054 --> 23:50.973
I know how this goes.

23:51.056 --> 23:52.224
It ends badly.

23:52.307 --> 23:54.226
Till it doesn't.

23:54.309 --> 23:57.312
Come on, you know my shit.

23:57.396 --> 23:58.522
You know mine.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.315
But you don't have
my condition.

24:00.399 --> 24:04.278
I've seen you... at your worst.

24:04.361 --> 24:06.238
You should be heading
for the hills.

24:06.321 --> 24:07.447
Look, Islamabad was ugly.

24:07.531 --> 24:09.616
It was a black hole,

24:09.700 --> 24:13.829
and I don't want anything
like that in my life ever again.

24:13.912 --> 24:16.874
I want to get out and stay out.

24:16.957 --> 24:18.250
Yeah.

24:18.333 --> 24:22.296
But I can't
do it on my own.

24:22.379 --> 24:25.299
I've learned that.

24:27.134 --> 24:29.303
Well, I haven't exactly
been helpful.

24:29.386 --> 24:31.889
But you could be.

24:31.972 --> 24:34.766
You want out, too.

24:34.850 --> 24:36.894
We get out together.

24:49.948 --> 24:52.451
Well, you think about it,
Carrie.

25:09.927 --> 25:12.137
(vehicle door opens, closes)

25:14.139 --> 25:15.599
(engine starts)

25:53.303 --> 25:55.514

26:05.023 --> 26:06.984

27:12.466 --> 27:14.676

27:46.375 --> 27:48.585

27:57.010 --> 27:58.720
You don't even know
where she lives.

27:58.804 --> 28:00.305
Missouri plates.
I saw the tag number.

28:00.389 --> 28:01.932
And?

28:02.015 --> 28:04.226
I'll have her
address in an hour.

28:04.309 --> 28:05.853
You're just gonna
show up?

28:05.936 --> 28:07.437
That's what she did.

28:07.521 --> 28:09.147
And you kicked her out.

28:09.231 --> 28:13.443
I want her to look me
in the eye and explain herself.

28:15.529 --> 28:16.780
Can she stay?

28:16.864 --> 28:18.115
I got her.

28:18.198 --> 28:19.908
It's a long drive.

28:19.992 --> 28:22.744
I don't want to leave her again.

28:22.828 --> 28:25.747
Babies and road
trips, bad mix.

28:25.831 --> 28:28.667
(gurgling)

28:28.750 --> 28:30.669
Are you sure that's okay?

28:30.752 --> 28:31.920
Positive.

28:32.004 --> 28:33.547
It's only a couple days.

28:35.424 --> 28:38.343
I could use some time to think.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.681
Okay.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.266
-Bye, sweetheart.
-(chuckles)

28:50.564 --> 28:52.357
-Say bye-bye.
-(engine starts)

28:52.441 --> 28:53.775
Bye-bye, Mommy.

28:55.861 --> 28:57.738
Yay.

28:57.821 --> 29:00.032
(chuckles)

29:11.084 --> 29:13.712
Douche bag.

29:13.795 --> 29:15.047
Asshole.

29:15.130 --> 29:16.256
Hey, welcome back.

29:16.340 --> 29:17.341
Thanks.

29:17.424 --> 29:18.842
Just in time.

29:18.926 --> 29:19.968
For the holidays.

29:20.052 --> 29:21.720
For the next thing.

29:21.803 --> 29:23.388
Group's been looking for you.

29:23.472 --> 29:24.765
Yeah, I lost my phone.

29:24.848 --> 29:25.933
Fuck off.

29:26.016 --> 29:27.184
Or maybe I took a hammer to it.

29:27.267 --> 29:30.187
We got a location
on three high-value IS targets

29:30.270 --> 29:32.231
in some fortified shit hole
in Aleppo,

29:32.314 --> 29:35.108
and a very narrow window
before they fuck off again.

29:35.234 --> 29:36.360
And?

29:36.443 --> 29:37.569
We fly tomorrow night.

29:37.653 --> 29:39.196
Without me.

29:39.279 --> 29:41.073
Hey, group orders:
all hands,

29:41.156 --> 29:42.741
-no exceptions.
-I quit the group, Rob.

29:42.824 --> 29:44.159
Since when?

29:44.243 --> 29:45.786
Since right now, I guess.

29:45.869 --> 29:47.204
Stop fucking around.

29:47.287 --> 29:50.749
Shit, shower, shave,
and let's go.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.417
No, I'm serious.

29:52.501 --> 29:54.211
I'm out.

29:54.294 --> 29:55.379
Moved on.

29:55.462 --> 29:56.463
To what?

29:56.547 --> 29:57.548
You care?

29:57.631 --> 29:59.591
-Not really.
-Mm.

29:59.675 --> 30:02.010
I just care about you showing up
to the airframe tomorrow.

30:02.094 --> 30:04.012
Can't do it.

30:04.096 --> 30:06.431
You want me to take
a new guy on this?

30:06.515 --> 30:08.225
He's got to learn sometime.

30:10.727 --> 30:12.688
Peter.

30:12.771 --> 30:15.649
My estimation,

30:15.732 --> 30:18.569
we're 20% less likely
to pull this off without you.

30:18.652 --> 30:21.029
20% more likely to lose guys.

30:25.492 --> 30:27.452
I'm sorry.

30:27.536 --> 30:29.955
Right.

30:34.084 --> 30:36.044
Then this is your job.

30:38.088 --> 30:40.924
Let's hope we get this done
without you

30:41.008 --> 30:43.260
and you don't have
to deliver any of those.

30:43.343 --> 30:46.138

What are you doing here?

34:00.499 --> 34:02.459
I drove.

34:02.543 --> 34:05.087
All night.

34:05.170 --> 34:07.005
I went to your house.

34:07.089 --> 34:09.466
Did you?

34:09.550 --> 34:11.468
There was a boy there.

34:11.552 --> 34:13.428
He told me where to find you.

Tim.

Who is he?

Your brother.

34:20.519 --> 34:22.479
Half-brother.

34:25.190 --> 34:27.401
So you left your children
to go have more children?

34:27.484 --> 34:30.112
(school bell rings)

34:30.195 --> 34:32.281

Sure.

Hey, let's go.

35:07.399 --> 35:09.568
It's not exactly Walter's.

35:09.651 --> 35:11.695
Out of business, huh?

35:11.778 --> 35:13.655
Walter retired.

35:13.739 --> 35:15.866
It's now a Pain Quotidien.

35:15.949 --> 35:17.075
Things change.

35:17.159 --> 35:18.493
Things go to shit.

35:18.577 --> 35:20.329
Yeah. How are
the waffles?

35:20.412 --> 35:23.165
Not bad.

35:23.248 --> 35:24.875
I heard you met
with Crocker.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.084
I did.

35:26.168 --> 35:27.336
Well, what about?

35:27.419 --> 35:29.004
Damage assessment.

35:29.087 --> 35:30.506
And?

35:30.589 --> 35:32.716
Two torpedoes in my side,
taking on water.

35:32.799 --> 35:34.676
(chuckles)

35:34.760 --> 35:37.763
Lockhart's resignation
will be on the president's desk

35:37.846 --> 35:39.181
by the end of next week.

35:39.264 --> 35:40.390
So I hear.

35:40.474 --> 35:42.351
What if I told you

35:42.434 --> 35:45.479
I can put your name back on
the short list to replace him?

35:45.562 --> 35:49.816
I'd say you were having
a major senior moment.

35:58.242 --> 36:00.577
What's that?

36:00.661 --> 36:03.914
It's the video
of you and Haqqani.

36:03.997 --> 36:07.417
I've been assured
it's the only copy.

36:07.501 --> 36:08.627
But even if it isn't,

36:08.710 --> 36:12.005
I've been assured
it'll never be released.

36:12.089 --> 36:13.799
Don't look so shocked.

36:13.882 --> 36:16.218
We have to see events
for what they are.

36:16.301 --> 36:17.719
WOMAN:
Good morning.

36:17.803 --> 36:19.638
Can I get you gentlemen
started with anything?

36:19.721 --> 36:20.973
Coffee?

36:21.056 --> 36:22.599
-Can we have a minute?
-Take your time.

36:27.020 --> 36:28.939
What have you done
to get this?

36:29.022 --> 36:32.484
It's not what I've done.
It's what I got in return.

36:34.319 --> 36:35.863
What have you done?

36:35.946 --> 36:39.283
I reached out
to Haqqani.

36:39.366 --> 36:42.160
I told him I'd take his
name off the kill list

36:42.244 --> 36:44.496
in exchange for
a commitment

36:44.580 --> 36:47.416
not to harbor terrorists
in Afghanistan.

36:47.541 --> 36:48.667
He's the fucking terrorist.

36:48.750 --> 36:50.169
Is he?

36:50.252 --> 36:52.421
He just massacred 36 Americans.

36:52.504 --> 36:54.631
Menachem Begin killed

36:54.715 --> 36:58.260
91 British soldiers
at the King David Hotel

36:58.343 --> 37:01.471
before becoming prime minister.

37:03.265 --> 37:06.185
You know
what this conversation is?

37:06.268 --> 37:07.477
Sedition.

37:07.561 --> 37:08.645
Saul,

37:08.729 --> 37:10.647
steady.

37:12.691 --> 37:14.610
Well, it's wrong.

37:14.693 --> 37:16.236
Just plain wrong.

37:16.320 --> 37:19.698
In the two months since we
handed over combat operations

37:19.781 --> 37:23.785
in Helmand, the Taliban
has reclaimed district centers

37:23.869 --> 37:25.662
in all but one city.

37:25.746 --> 37:28.457
Haqqani will be in Kabul
by Christmas.

37:28.540 --> 37:31.585
Well, what makes you think
he'll keep his word?

37:31.668 --> 37:33.003
Why anyone keeps their word.

37:33.086 --> 37:35.297
Because it's
in their self-interest.

37:35.380 --> 37:38.050
Plus...

37:38.133 --> 37:41.678
he offered a show of good faith.

37:43.722 --> 37:45.349
And let's face it,

37:45.432 --> 37:49.019
not every choice we make
is blessed with moral clarity.

37:49.102 --> 37:50.646
Especially in our business.

37:50.729 --> 37:53.732
What's that line?

37:53.815 --> 37:57.694
"We are the no-men
of no-man's-land."

37:57.778 --> 38:00.489
Come back.

38:00.572 --> 38:02.533
Lead us.

38:03.909 --> 38:07.538

for you with open arms.

<i>Hi.</i>

38:38.277 --> 38:40.279
Hey.

38:40.362 --> 38:42.614
There's a rumor
you're in Missouri.

38:42.698 --> 38:44.283
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>(sighs)</i>

38:44.366 --> 38:46.118
<i>I found out where my mom is.</i>

38:46.201 --> 38:47.578
And drove there.

38:47.661 --> 38:50.289
It's out of the blue,
I know. Um...

38:50.372 --> 38:51.540
I should have called you.

38:51.623 --> 38:54.585
It's just been a whirlwind.

38:54.668 --> 38:56.962
<i>How are you?</i>

38:57.045 --> 38:59.214
I'm wondering about you.

39:01.049 --> 39:02.593
Yeah.

39:02.676 --> 39:05.596
Um, we should talk, obviously.

39:05.679 --> 39:08.098
You want me to join you?
I could fly out.

39:08.974 --> 39:11.685
Uh, no, no.

39:11.768 --> 39:13.604
You sure?

39:13.687 --> 39:17.149
<i>Yeah, I'm kind of</i>
<i>in the middle of something.</i>

39:17.232 --> 39:19.776
I have a brother, it turns out.

39:19.860 --> 39:20.944
What?

39:21.028 --> 39:22.738
<i>Yeah. See, I...</i>

39:22.821 --> 39:24.239
I have a lot to deal with.

39:24.323 --> 39:27.451
I can't think about
anything else right now.

39:27.534 --> 39:30.537
Hey, look, if it's a no,
just say.

39:30.621 --> 39:32.789
It's not. I... I just...

39:32.873 --> 39:34.791
I've been dealing
with this other stuff.

39:34.875 --> 39:36.835
No problem.

39:36.919 --> 39:40.005
God, look at me, Quinn.

39:40.088 --> 39:44.009
I'm on a crazy road trip
like my dad used to take.

39:45.802 --> 39:47.429
I'm no good for you.

39:47.513 --> 39:49.348
<i>Or anyone else.</i>

39:49.431 --> 39:51.266
So it is a no.

39:51.350 --> 39:53.602
I didn't say that.

39:53.685 --> 39:55.687
Don't pressure me, okay?

39:55.771 --> 39:58.023
Okay.

39:59.900 --> 40:02.069
Look, I got to go. Um...

40:02.152 --> 40:04.613
I'll be back in a few days.
We'll talk then.

40:05.697 --> 40:08.867
Right.

40:08.951 --> 40:11.161
Bye.

40:30.722 --> 40:32.975
(car approaching)

40:49.199 --> 40:51.410
Hydrangeas.

40:52.327 --> 40:54.496
Your dad.

40:54.580 --> 40:57.708
"They'll take all your water,
but they're worth it."

40:59.376 --> 41:03.213
So should I be bracing
to meet Tim's father?

41:03.297 --> 41:05.007
No.

41:05.090 --> 41:07.676
He left before
the baby was born.

41:10.220 --> 41:13.557
And how old is Tim?
He's 14, 15?

41:13.640 --> 41:15.851
15.

41:16.894 --> 41:19.229
Why didn't you just...

41:19.313 --> 41:22.274
tell us you were pregnant?

41:22.357 --> 41:24.693
I couldn't.

41:24.776 --> 41:27.529
But you could
just vanish?

41:27.613 --> 41:30.490
It's hard to explain.

41:30.574 --> 41:33.827
Well, how about you try.

41:36.830 --> 41:39.750
I guess I wasn't
very good at being married.

41:39.833 --> 41:42.878
You mean you weren't very
good at being married to Dad.

41:42.961 --> 41:45.589
To anyone.

41:45.672 --> 41:48.592
I don't get it.

41:48.675 --> 41:50.761
(sighs)

41:50.844 --> 41:53.805
Let's go inside.

42:01.063 --> 42:03.607
Did Dad know?

42:03.690 --> 42:07.194
Not about
Tim's father, no.

42:07.277 --> 42:10.697
Wh-What do you mean,
not about Tim's father?

42:16.578 --> 42:18.080
There were others?

42:18.163 --> 42:20.707
Yeah. There were others.

42:22.042 --> 42:24.628
How did I not know about this?

42:24.711 --> 42:26.296
Dad never said a word.

42:26.380 --> 42:29.091
He was loyal like that.

42:29.174 --> 42:32.928
He'd forgive me, and then I'd...

42:33.011 --> 42:36.348
go out and do it all over again.

42:36.431 --> 42:38.767
Until it ruined us.

42:44.982 --> 42:47.609
He always said that-that
you left because of him.

42:47.693 --> 42:50.529
Because he was too
impossible to live with.

42:52.406 --> 42:54.324
No.

42:54.408 --> 42:57.786
I mean, it wasn't easy.

42:57.870 --> 43:01.373
It was a circus at times--
you know that.

43:01.456 --> 43:02.833
Yeah.

43:02.916 --> 43:05.085
But I broke it apart.

43:06.753 --> 43:09.673
I got pregnant and...

43:09.756 --> 43:13.594
couldn't face up
to what I'd done.

43:13.677 --> 43:15.888
Uh, so don't blame him.

43:15.971 --> 43:18.849
Blame him? Blame <i>him?</i>

43:18.932 --> 43:20.559
No, I-I don't.

43:20.642 --> 43:22.227
Good.

43:22.311 --> 43:25.856
He stayed. You're the
one who let me down.

43:25.939 --> 43:28.817
Right when I needed you
the most, by the way.

43:28.901 --> 43:31.153
What's that mean?

43:33.572 --> 43:35.490
I got sick.

43:35.574 --> 43:38.076
Like Dad. The first
month of college.

43:38.160 --> 43:40.204
And then a professor
walked me into the E.R.,

43:40.287 --> 43:42.247
and then I'm on
a psych ward,

43:42.331 --> 43:44.458
and then I'm in a room--
just me and a mattress

43:44.541 --> 43:45.709
and a cage on the window.

43:45.792 --> 43:48.003
Oh, my God.

43:48.086 --> 43:50.172
All I wanted was my mom.

43:50.255 --> 43:52.799
And you were not there.
You were nowhere.

43:54.676 --> 43:56.678
How do you not call?

43:56.762 --> 44:00.307
How do you not send
a fucking Christmas card?

44:00.390 --> 44:02.726
I always meant
to get in touch,

44:02.809 --> 44:05.479
but I couldn't say
what I'd done.

44:05.562 --> 44:08.398
I'd hurt so many people already.

44:08.482 --> 44:12.027
I just had to stop.

44:12.110 --> 44:14.905
I had to stop
and do one...

44:14.988 --> 44:16.657
right thing.

44:16.740 --> 44:20.035
Focus on Tim.

44:20.118 --> 44:21.995
And so I did.

44:29.336 --> 44:31.338
I have to go.

44:31.421 --> 44:33.006
Are you okay?

44:35.133 --> 44:36.760
I've always thought
that being bipolar

44:36.844 --> 44:38.720
meant that you couldn't
be with people.

44:38.804 --> 44:39.930
Not for the long haul,

44:40.013 --> 44:42.683
'cause they'll up
and leave you, soon enough.

44:42.766 --> 44:43.934
No.

44:44.017 --> 44:45.936
Well, that's
what I've thought.

44:46.019 --> 44:47.145
All this time.

44:47.229 --> 44:51.233
It's not true.
Please believe that.

44:52.776 --> 44:55.445
I don't even know
if that's possible anymore.

44:58.824 --> 45:01.535
It's possible.

45:30.606 --> 45:32.274
(line ringing)

45:32.357 --> 45:34.151
-(line clicks, beeps)
-Quinn.

46:14.650 --> 46:16.860
Where is he? Where's Quinn?

46:33.252 --> 46:35.170
All right, put
those with the M4s.

46:37.089 --> 46:38.757
Next to the generator,
over there.

46:38.841 --> 46:41.051
Who's the new guy?

46:44.638 --> 46:47.015
Dale.

46:56.066 --> 46:57.484
I'm going. You're not.

46:57.568 --> 46:58.694
What?

46:58.777 --> 47:00.821
Take these.

47:00.904 --> 47:02.072
This is fucked up.

47:02.155 --> 47:05.033
Yeah.

47:05.117 --> 47:06.994
Take them.

47:53.332 --> 47:55.209
(doorbell rings)

48:01.298 --> 48:03.425
(doorbell rings)

48:08.764 --> 48:10.140
A call back would've been nice.

48:10.224 --> 48:12.351
You were the one who was
supposed to be in touch with me.

48:12.434 --> 48:13.852
After you heard from Peter.

48:13.936 --> 48:16.939
Where is he?

48:18.607 --> 48:20.817
Not out here.

48:25.364 --> 48:26.865
Where is he?

48:26.949 --> 48:28.450
I imagine somewhere
on the Turkish border by now,

48:28.534 --> 48:29.993
about to cross over
into Syria.

48:30.077 --> 48:31.286
-I need to speak to him.
-Impossible.

48:31.370 --> 48:33.288
-Don't give me that bullshit.
-Hey.

48:33.372 --> 48:35.249
If he's on a mission,
there's a way to reach him.

48:35.332 --> 48:36.542
Actually, there's not.

48:36.625 --> 48:38.126
They went dark
a little over an hour ago.

48:38.210 --> 48:39.503
I was just on the phone
to Ops 4.

48:39.586 --> 48:41.213
When do they check in next?

48:41.296 --> 48:42.464
They don't.

48:42.548 --> 48:44.132
What do you mean?

48:44.216 --> 48:45.467
The mission is open-ended.

48:45.551 --> 48:47.469
They're responsible
for their own extraction.

48:47.553 --> 48:49.763
From Syria?

48:49.847 --> 48:51.974
From Iraq, most likely.

48:52.808 --> 48:55.185
I need to speak to Quinn.

48:55.269 --> 48:57.771
And I said no.

49:01.275 --> 49:03.360
I saw you in Islamabad.

49:06.029 --> 49:09.366
In the backseat of an SUV
with Haissam Haqqani.

49:09.449 --> 49:12.369
What are you playing at, Carrie?

49:12.452 --> 49:15.706
I call it give me
what I fucking want.

49:15.789 --> 49:17.207
You're not listening. I can't.

49:17.291 --> 49:19.418
I will leave here and go
straight to <i>The Washington Post.</i>

49:19.501 --> 49:20.544
No, you won't.

49:20.627 --> 49:22.212
Watch me.

49:22.296 --> 49:24.798
You might consider
talking to Saul before you do.

49:24.882 --> 49:27.926
He'd explain to you
what's at stake here.

49:28.010 --> 49:29.970
I know what's at stake.

49:30.053 --> 49:32.639
You make a deal with Haqqani,
you dishonor every officer,

49:32.723 --> 49:35.726
every soldier at the embassy
who died at his hands.

49:35.809 --> 49:39.271
Saul would spit in your face.

49:47.237 --> 49:49.489
Ask him yourself.
