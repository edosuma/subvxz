00:23.023 --> 00:25.859
- Dr Jackson. Colonel.
- General.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.986
The message I got was pretty vague.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.489
So was the transmission from the Tok'ra.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.075
- Did they say who was coming?
- No.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.452
- Did they say why?
- No, sir.

00:35.577 --> 00:38.580
Now, see... That's rude. I hate that.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.667
(PA) Receiving Tok'ra IDC.
Opening the iris.

00:44.127 --> 00:47.631
In fact, the Tok'ra
are starting to annoy me in general.

00:47.881 --> 00:51.468
- Sir?
- Don't get me wrong. Your dad's great.

00:51.593 --> 00:54.304
But whenever they show up,
there's all kinds of...

01:03.188 --> 01:05.232
Yep, that looks like trouble to me.

01:13.031 --> 01:15.951
(distorted) The High Council of the Tok'ra
sends its greetings.

01:16.034 --> 01:20.247
Welcome. I'm General Hammond.
Colonel O'Neill. Dr Jackson.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.374
Major Carter and Teal'c.

01:24.376 --> 01:27.546
This is Marnon. You may call me Anise.

01:29.006 --> 01:32.176
- Anise?
- It means "noble strength".

01:32.259 --> 01:34.636
I'm... I'm Daniel. It means, uh...

01:35.762 --> 01:38.223
.."God is my judge".

01:40.726 --> 01:43.020
I'm Jack. It means...

01:45.898 --> 01:47.357
What's in the box?

01:52.279 --> 01:57.409
These armbands were recently found
among ancient ruins on a remote planet.

01:57.492 --> 02:00.245
(Jackson) I don't recognise
the symbols. May l?

02:00.329 --> 02:02.998
The language belongs
to a race called the Ataniks.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.709
Their existence and demise
predates the Goa'uld.

02:05.792 --> 02:09.128
Ataniks. I think Jolinar knew about these.

02:09.253 --> 02:12.341
They give the wearer
incredible speed and strength?

02:12.466 --> 02:15.177
Yes. Many thought it was just a myth.

02:15.260 --> 02:19.348
Still, the Goa'uld and the Tok'ra have
sought these devices for some time.

02:19.431 --> 02:23.477
- Obviously not a myth.
- The Tok'ra were very excited by my find.

02:23.560 --> 02:27.481
- You found them?
- My area of expertise is ancient cultures.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.859
- Oh, mine, too.
- Yes, I know.

02:32.277 --> 02:36.114
We hoped the devices would give us
a great new physical advantage...

02:36.198 --> 02:40.118
- ..in the fight against the Goa'uld.
- However...

02:47.251 --> 02:49.127
They don't work for you.

02:49.253 --> 02:52.589
Our top scientists have researched
the technology at length.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.759
To the best of our knowledge,
the devices should work.

02:55.884 --> 02:59.471
However, something causes them
to reject the Tok'ra physiology.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.683
- Your symbiote.
- That is a likely assumption.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.227
Then the device will be ineffective on me.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.313
Yes. Which is why I brought only three.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.316
Uh, I still have
a protein marker left by Jolinar.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.610
Hopefully, that will have no effect.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.989
"Incredible speed and strength."

03:17.114 --> 03:22.786
According to the inscriptions, they should
greatly increase all your natural abilities.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.205
That's kinda cool.

03:25.330 --> 03:29.376
In the interests of the Tok'ra-human
alliance, I expected you to cooperate.

03:29.459 --> 03:32.963
Couldn't we take some time
to learn more about these things?

03:33.046 --> 03:35.007
Perhaps Major Carter and Dr Jackson...

03:35.132 --> 03:39.178
I had hoped to begin
human trial experiments immediately.

03:39.261 --> 03:43.640
- What's the rush?
- If you are not willing to participate,...

03:43.724 --> 03:47.394
..l will find human subjects
on another planet.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.107
Fine.

03:54.651 --> 03:59.364
(undistorted) Please forgive the scientist
in Anise. She has worked hard for this.

03:59.489 --> 04:03.160
I assure you, every
safety precaution will be taken.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.253
(distorted) What is your answer?

05:31.874 --> 05:33.750
This is a Tok'ra bio-sensor.

05:33.834 --> 05:38.297
It will monitor every aspect
of your physiological condition.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.800
Whoa.

05:42.968 --> 05:47.347
It will transmit readings to this device
for the duration of the experiment.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.474
OK.

05:59.484 --> 06:02.112
- Ready?
- As I'll ever be.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.250
- What's that mean?
- The device is working.

06:19.755 --> 06:22.841
I don't feel like...
Ieaping any tall buildings.

06:22.925 --> 06:25.719
It may take time for the device
to adjust to your body.

06:25.802 --> 06:30.349
We believe it was designed to gradually
allow you to adapt to your new abilities.

06:30.432 --> 06:35.312
In the meantime, feel free to interact with
your environment as you normally would.

06:35.437 --> 06:40.317
The bio-sensor will transmit readings
over significant distance.

06:41.652 --> 06:42.653
OK.

06:49.243 --> 06:54.122
- You feel no effects from the armband?
- No. I'm starting to think this is a crock.

06:59.962 --> 07:03.131
Come on, Teal'c, bring it.
You're goin' easy.

07:04.550 --> 07:09.012
I am attempting to make physical contact,
but you are boxing with great proficiency.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.890
Really? I feel a little stiff.

07:29.533 --> 07:31.076
Teal'c?

07:38.208 --> 07:41.128
- Are you feeling better?
- I will be fine, Dr Fraiser.

07:41.503 --> 07:44.506
Teal'c... I'm really sorry.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.760
You are not.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.181
He's right about that.

07:55.684 --> 07:58.228
Please squeeze this.

08:02.232 --> 08:05.152
- What is it?
- It will measure your strength.

08:08.238 --> 08:09.781
(creaking)

08:11.783 --> 08:15.704
Your strength is five times
that of a normal human.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.207
So... no increase, then, huh?

08:20.250 --> 08:25.047
- Physiology remains otherwise normal.
- Well, l... I feel good.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.635
Three.

08:30.135 --> 08:33.304
And, uh... you seem
to have developed a sweet tooth.

08:35.390 --> 08:39.937
Your metabolism is increasing to match
the energy your body now requires.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.563
You were going to show me
how to read this thing.

08:42.648 --> 08:46.902
I will. First it is time to increase
the number of subjects in the experiment.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.420
I don't really feel any different.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.048
Just wait.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.851
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:21.812 --> 09:23.856
Notice anything yet?

09:25.274 --> 09:27.317
You're eating a lot.

09:29.611 --> 09:32.072
Hm. Give it time.

09:50.132 --> 09:52.342
Did you just read that?

09:53.886 --> 09:55.929
I guess.

09:56.180 --> 09:59.933
Don't suppose there's another book
that explains this book.

10:00.017 --> 10:04.646
What reason did Hobbes give
for the fall of the civilisation?

10:05.147 --> 10:08.734
- Failing agricultural infrastructure.
- That's unbelievable.

10:08.901 --> 10:10.944
Hey, it's his theory.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.133
Want me to read to you?

10:40.682 --> 10:42.726
- Sam?
- Yeah?

10:43.769 --> 10:48.232
- What are you doing?
- Running tests on the armband material.

10:48.315 --> 10:52.069
Ah. It's... a little dark, don't you think?

10:52.194 --> 10:54.238
Is it?

10:56.365 --> 10:59.034
Ow. It's bright.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.161
Yeah. The lights were out.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.582
I came in. I didn't even realise.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.180
Well, it looks normal to me.

11:20.264 --> 11:23.517
I could see in the dark
as well as if the light was on.

11:28.564 --> 11:32.860
- You're running a slight temperature.
- Anise is monitoring our vitals.

11:32.985 --> 11:34.778
Yes, I know.

11:34.903 --> 11:37.281
You don't trust her bio-sensors?

11:38.073 --> 11:42.077
No, I'm sure her technology
is very advanced and very accurate.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.204
So you don't trust her.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.625
I'd like to run a full blood screen.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.686
(treadmill stops)

12:09.104 --> 12:11.148
Very good.

12:13.233 --> 12:17.613
I'm not even sweatin'. In fact,
I think that thing's slowin' me down.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.781
Squeeze this.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.459
Sorry.

12:35.297 --> 12:39.384
It's the most unbelievable...
incredible thing I've ever experienced.

12:39.468 --> 12:44.848
I've checked the symbols on the armband
against every written language in an hour.

12:44.932 --> 12:47.935
- What did you find?
- Nothing, but...

12:48.060 --> 12:50.103
You see, the point is,...

12:50.229 --> 12:52.773
..l can read really fast.

12:53.315 --> 12:57.945
Here are my notes on the Ataniks.
I thought you might be interested.

12:59.488 --> 13:00.948
You write in a notebook?

13:01.031 --> 13:04.701
My host Freya enjoys
the tactile sensation of handwriting.

13:24.805 --> 13:28.559
The inscription says "With great power
comes great responsibility."

13:28.892 --> 13:32.646
"And the ability
to effect great consequences."

13:33.438 --> 13:36.692
You don't speculate on
why the Atanik became extinct.

13:36.775 --> 13:40.529
No. My primary concern until now
was finding the armbands...

13:40.612 --> 13:42.906
..and then determining how they worked.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.658
(squeaking)

13:47.202 --> 13:49.079
(squeaking stops)

13:51.832 --> 13:53.876
What does that mean?

13:59.631 --> 14:03.802
(as Anise) I believe all the armbands have
now reached their maximum potential.

14:04.136 --> 14:07.139
Anise? Can I see you for a moment?

14:16.815 --> 14:19.568
They all have raised body temperatures.

14:19.651 --> 14:22.196
- They're in no danger.
- I disagree.

14:22.279 --> 14:25.073
Their symptoms are indicative of a virus.

14:25.157 --> 14:30.204
You are correct. My bio-data indicates the
armband put a virus into their systems.

14:30.287 --> 14:31.872
Doesn't that concern you?

14:31.955 --> 14:35.876
It must be how the technology
accesses the human physiology.

14:36.001 --> 14:41.048
It took a different amount of time in each
individual, due to their unique reactions.

14:41.131 --> 14:47.054
That's speculation. Major Carter's blood
had a dangerous amount of adrenaline.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.681
I object to interference in my experiment.

14:49.806 --> 14:54.770
I object to being kept in the dark about
people whose health I am responsible for.

14:54.853 --> 14:58.106
Are you suggesting
I would risk their health?

14:58.232 --> 15:03.111
We're seeing very interesting results.
You want to discontinue the experiment?

15:03.195 --> 15:07.908
Until we know more about
the physical effects of this virus, yes.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.702
I say we remove the armbands
and run more tests...

15:10.786 --> 15:13.872
..to ensure these changes
aren't permanent or damaging.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.999
- General...
- No, I'm sorry.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.335
One thing I've learned in my time here is...

15:18.460 --> 15:23.173
..there's nothing wrong with prudence
when dealing with alien devices.

15:28.595 --> 15:32.891
Based on Dr Fraiser's recommendation,
I'm stopping the experiment temporarily.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.601
- What?
- Why?

15:34.685 --> 15:38.021
We'd like to find out exactly
what these things are doing to you.

15:38.146 --> 15:41.567
- General...
- I'd rather not do that, sir.

15:41.692 --> 15:46.321
The armbands may have a narcotic effect.
Wearing them may become addictive.

15:46.405 --> 15:48.949
It's just one of the things
I'd like to rule out.

15:49.032 --> 15:52.452
- Please, take the armbands off.
- But...

15:52.578 --> 15:55.455
Are you refusing
to comply with a direct order?

16:10.179 --> 16:13.182
Uh... a little problem here, sir.

16:13.265 --> 16:16.101
- Colonel?
- Having a hard time complying.

16:34.286 --> 16:38.457
We have tried everything short of
surgically removing their arms.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.751
We'll hold that option in reserve.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.712
(as Freya) You must admit
the positive effect is astonishing.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.006
As long as there's no downside.

16:47.716 --> 16:51.553
- (as Anise) There is no evidence of that.
- Yet.

16:53.055 --> 16:56.391
Find a way to get those armbands
off my people.

16:59.811 --> 17:03.482
(O'Neill) Teal'c,
how much do I have on here?

17:03.607 --> 17:06.484
It appears to be
approximately 600 pounds.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.950
Really?

17:16.453 --> 17:18.497
Not bad.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.461
Are you not concerned that
the armband cannot be removed?

17:24.545 --> 17:27.381
Nope. This thing's great.

17:29.508 --> 17:34.304
We will not resume our duties as SG-1
as long as this experiment continues.

17:35.722 --> 17:41.144
Yeah, well... I'm gonna have to have
a little chat with Hammond about that.

17:42.396 --> 17:44.439
We should be usin' these things.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.177
- Hey!
- Hey.

18:14.595 --> 18:17.598
- What are you working on?
- A book on wormhole physics.

18:17.723 --> 18:19.850
But this computer isn't fast enough.

18:19.975 --> 18:23.145
When the buffer's full,
I have to wait for it to catch up.

18:23.228 --> 18:26.148
You know, we really could use your help.

18:26.523 --> 18:29.860
You just don't get it, Janet.
I don't wanna take it off.

18:30.736 --> 18:34.239
OK. I realise
they're making you feel really good...

18:34.364 --> 18:38.744
Look! I have written a 1 ,000-page book
in under two hours.

18:38.869 --> 18:41.830
I've been dying to do this
but I haven't had the time.

18:41.914 --> 18:43.790
- Sam...
- Janet...

18:44.833 --> 18:46.877
(very fast typing)

18:52.007 --> 18:54.384
- Absolutely not.
- Come on, General!

18:54.468 --> 18:58.680
- Why'd we put these things on?
- We still don't know the long-term effects.

18:58.764 --> 19:03.727
We shouldn't be wastin' this stuff. We
oughta be out kickin' some Goa'uld butt!

19:04.645 --> 19:05.646
Look at this!

19:13.237 --> 19:15.697
Sorry about that, General.

19:16.532 --> 19:20.828
Colonel, I'm concerned that you aren't
in full control of your new abilities.

19:21.370 --> 19:24.706
Well, you may be right.
It's just so damn exciting, sir!

19:25.123 --> 19:28.627
- I'm sure it is.
- And, even if we're not in total control,...

19:28.710 --> 19:32.714
..shouldn't we be out there doin'
the damage, instead of in your office?

19:32.798 --> 19:35.092
I'm concerned
for your wellbeing, Colonel.

19:35.175 --> 19:39.471
And I appreciate it. And you're the boss.
Whatever you say goes.

19:39.596 --> 19:43.600
I just want you to know that
we're here for you, ready to go!

19:44.101 --> 19:46.645
Just... Just say the word.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.939
Thank you.

19:50.983 --> 19:53.902
Seriously. Say it. Say the word.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.822
- Dismissed.
- We can be ready in three seconds.

19:56.947 --> 19:58.907
- Colonel...
- Two. Heck, we're ready!

19:59.032 --> 20:02.786
Jack, please! Just...
get the hell outta my office.

20:05.122 --> 20:07.166
Yes, sir.

20:11.795 --> 20:13.672
- Hey, Siler.
- Aaargh!

20:13.755 --> 20:15.799
(crash)

20:19.720 --> 20:21.763
- Aw, crap.
- (Silermoans)

20:36.778 --> 20:39.323
This is ridiculous. It was an accident.

20:40.115 --> 20:42.659
Siler has a broken arm and a concussion.

20:43.494 --> 20:45.537
He'll pull through.

20:46.288 --> 20:48.332
I sent flowers.

20:49.458 --> 20:53.587
You have to admit it's a little scary.
I feel like I could... do anything.

20:53.670 --> 20:56.298
All I know is I'm gonna starve to death.

20:56.381 --> 21:01.261
I don't know about you guys, but
I'm having some serious protein cravings.

21:03.013 --> 21:06.767
- Steak.
- I could go for that.

21:06.850 --> 21:10.437
Big, red, juicy meat.

21:11.188 --> 21:13.482
- O'Malley's, in town.
- Let's go.

21:26.119 --> 21:28.163
Let's eat.

21:40.050 --> 21:43.303
- How high do you think that fence was?
- 20, 25 feet?

21:43.428 --> 21:45.639
I'd say more like 30.

21:45.722 --> 21:47.933
What can I get you?

21:48.016 --> 21:49.810
Um...

21:50.227 --> 21:54.857
Three of the biggest steaks you've got,
with everything. Rare. Baked potato.

21:54.982 --> 21:56.608
You got it.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.777
Excuse me.

21:59.444 --> 22:01.029
That was for me.

22:01.113 --> 22:04.074
- (Jackson) Yeah, I'll have three as well.
- Four?

22:04.158 --> 22:08.287
- Four. Four is good.
- Me, too. And French fries with mine.

22:08.370 --> 22:11.165
Oh, and a diet soda.

22:13.959 --> 22:16.086
I like the taste better.

22:24.636 --> 22:28.849
So has it occurred to anyone
that we're defying a direct order?

22:32.519 --> 22:36.440
- It's not like we haven't done it before.
- But that was to save Earth.

22:36.648 --> 22:38.692
Earth... Steaks...

22:39.026 --> 22:41.320
There's a difference?

22:41.403 --> 22:44.740
We'll be back before
anyone knows we're gone.

22:56.335 --> 22:59.505
- How the hell did you do that?
- Wanna go double or nothin'?

22:59.630 --> 23:02.299
- No, I think I'll cut my losses.
- Smart move.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.593
What are you laughin' at, you geek?

23:07.054 --> 23:08.764
Geek?

23:14.520 --> 23:16.897
- Excuse me?
- Let it go.

23:20.192 --> 23:22.236
No. Not this time.

23:22.361 --> 23:24.071
Yeah?

23:24.196 --> 23:26.573
What are you gonna do?

23:27.783 --> 23:29.827
(sighs)

23:34.248 --> 23:35.707
Well,...

23:35.791 --> 23:37.835
..this is a cliche.

23:43.882 --> 23:45.926
OK.

23:47.094 --> 23:50.013
(prolonged crashing and moaning)

23:58.146 --> 24:00.190
Right. OK.

24:02.943 --> 24:07.739
I thought the devices would enhance
them physically, not make them stupid.

24:07.865 --> 24:10.075
You'd have to ask Anise about that, sir.

24:10.200 --> 24:14.997
But their erratic behaviour could be
caused by the increase in hormone levels.

24:15.122 --> 24:17.583
It's almost a sort of intoxication.

24:17.666 --> 24:21.170
My concern is: how do we contain them
if they're that strong and fast?

24:21.253 --> 24:23.380
The concern is greater than that, sir.

24:23.505 --> 24:26.842
Blood tests show early indication
of multiple organ failure.

24:26.967 --> 24:30.220
The human body wasn't meant
to be put through this.

24:32.306 --> 24:35.142
So they'll die if we don't
get these things off them?

24:35.225 --> 24:39.229
I believe the key is the virus.
The armband's used as an intermediary.

24:39.313 --> 24:43.483
There's no magic pill to combat a virus,
but there are treatments we could try.

24:43.567 --> 24:45.611
But that's no guarantee.

24:46.445 --> 24:48.989
- No, sir.
- (footsteps)

24:53.619 --> 24:55.662
Thank you, Doctor.

25:04.129 --> 25:09.343
Can you explain why witnesses put you
people at a restaurant in town last night?

25:10.135 --> 25:13.472
- Sir, I can't tell you how...
- Sir, I can explain that.

25:15.849 --> 25:18.143
No, I can't.

25:18.227 --> 25:20.938
We were very hungry, sir.

25:21.021 --> 25:24.942
- The report says there was a brawl.
- More of a... scuffle, sir.

25:25.442 --> 25:30.656
- You're lucky you didn't kill those men.
- Now, we were very careful about that.

25:31.824 --> 25:34.201
What am I supposed to do
with you people?

25:34.284 --> 25:36.995
General, I can't tell you how sorry we are.

25:38.205 --> 25:40.415
But... Carter wanted a steak...

25:40.541 --> 25:44.294
- Actually, it was your idea, sir.
- My point is, General,...

25:44.419 --> 25:48.966
..that we were defying orders didn't occur
to us until we were actually... defying.

25:49.091 --> 25:53.804
It's like the armbands are having an effect
on our ability to make rational choices.

25:53.887 --> 25:57.307
General Hammond, I have a message
from the Tok'ra High Council.

25:57.391 --> 26:00.018
- What?
- I reported on the experiment...

26:00.102 --> 26:02.563
..and they have made a suggestion.

26:02.646 --> 26:05.649
- Regarding...?
- The High Council proposes...

26:05.774 --> 26:08.610
..putting SG-1's new skills
to practical use.

26:08.986 --> 26:11.530
Yesss... Sir.

26:13.073 --> 26:15.993
- What are they suggesting?
- We just received news...

26:16.076 --> 26:19.037
..of a new class of battleship
that Apophis is building.

26:19.121 --> 26:21.081
Just received?

26:21.165 --> 26:24.668
Our internal attempt at sabotage
has already failed.

26:24.751 --> 26:28.005
However, based on our intelligence,
a covert team could...

26:28.130 --> 26:30.174
You've known all along.

26:30.299 --> 26:32.759
- Excuse me?
- This was the point, wasn't it?

26:34.761 --> 26:36.722
(as Freya) General, I assure you...

26:36.805 --> 26:41.185
I've been at this a long time and I know
damn well when I'm being manipulated.

26:41.351 --> 26:43.478
I realise how this must look.

26:43.604 --> 26:47.524
- But in the interests of our alliance...
- Don't give me that load of bunk.

26:47.774 --> 26:51.528
Right now, I don't think the Tok'ra
have my people's best interest in mind.

26:51.737 --> 26:56.450
General, believe this: if Apophis
is allowed to complete this battleship,...

26:56.575 --> 27:00.162
..it will assure his dominance
over the Goa'uld, your planet...

27:00.287 --> 27:02.748
..and the rest of this galaxy.

27:04.500 --> 27:07.252
(as Anise) The High Council
will be disappointed.

27:07.336 --> 27:12.049
I have downloaded all we know
about the battleship into your computer.

27:12.174 --> 27:14.551
Hopefully, you will review it
and reconsider.

27:14.676 --> 27:16.803
- General, if I may...
- No, you may not.

27:18.055 --> 27:20.432
Take them back to the lockup.

27:20.557 --> 27:23.519
For what it's worth,
I'm ordering you to cooperate.

27:40.953 --> 27:42.996
Dismissed.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.794
Let's have a look.

27:59.137 --> 28:01.598
So you think we have a problem here?

28:04.309 --> 28:09.523
This new vessel has many advancements
over previous Goa'uld mother ships.

28:11.024 --> 28:15.404
- We must stop its completion.
- I can't send SG-1 on such a mission,...

28:15.529 --> 28:18.782
..knowing their judgment is impaired.

28:21.451 --> 28:23.662
I will go alone, then.

28:23.787 --> 28:28.250
According to the Tok'ra intelligence,
the gate on that planet is heavily guarded.

28:28.333 --> 28:30.377
I doubt even you could make it through.

28:30.502 --> 28:34.173
- Apophis must not complete this vessel.
- Let's say I agree, Teal'c.

28:34.298 --> 28:36.842
Prove to me it isn't a suicide mission.

28:46.393 --> 28:49.271
The gate will be heavily guarded,
but we can handle it.

28:49.354 --> 28:53.275
Wormhole physics dictate that you exit
at the same velocity that you enter.

28:53.358 --> 28:57.279
- They won't know what hit 'em.
- The facility will be more of a challenge.

28:57.404 --> 28:59.865
Can't we just zip in, plant C4 and zip out?

28:59.948 --> 29:05.704
No. The ship's power core is sealed in
trinium. That's what we have to take out.

29:06.497 --> 29:12.503
Hang on. The power core is linked to a
liquid cooling system based in the facility.

29:13.086 --> 29:17.216
- These pipes lead into it.
- So we zip in, blow the pipes and zip out.

29:17.633 --> 29:19.927
The core will overheat and explode.

29:20.052 --> 29:23.722
The problem is, force shields
are protecting this restricted area.

29:23.889 --> 29:25.474
So?

29:25.557 --> 29:27.267
So...

29:30.145 --> 29:32.439
I see your point.

29:35.359 --> 29:38.612
Goa'uld force shields operate
by frequency oscillation.

29:38.695 --> 29:40.739
If we were moving fast enough,...

29:40.864 --> 29:44.785
..we should see the oscillation interval
and run right through.

29:49.456 --> 29:51.750
We'll need snacks.

30:06.265 --> 30:07.724
(moans)

30:15.524 --> 30:17.484
(alarm)

30:27.161 --> 30:29.204
Let's go.

30:32.916 --> 30:34.960
(buzzer)

30:37.296 --> 30:39.339
O'Neill!

30:41.466 --> 30:43.010
Not this time, Teal'c.

30:53.645 --> 30:57.399
- Gate's open, sir.
- Shut her down. Get the blast doors open.

30:57.524 --> 31:00.235
I can't, sir. I'm locked out of the system.

31:01.695 --> 31:03.822
Medical team to the Control Room.

31:16.335 --> 31:18.378
Onak, kree!

31:45.989 --> 31:48.033
Argh!

32:10.097 --> 32:12.140
It takes two guys to carry that?

32:12.266 --> 32:15.143
Weapons-grade naqahdah
is extremely dense.

32:18.146 --> 32:22.276
D'you know how many naqahdah reactors
a single bar like that could power?

32:22.359 --> 32:23.861
- No.
- A lot!

32:23.944 --> 32:26.488
I'll get it. Meet you back here.

32:39.585 --> 32:42.296
- Wow. Sir, is it hot?
- A little bit.

32:42.379 --> 32:44.756
- You all right?
- Fine.

32:46.592 --> 32:50.179
The force shields should be...
somewhere around here.

32:55.267 --> 32:57.311
It's up.

33:03.192 --> 33:04.359
Whoa.

33:12.159 --> 33:14.203
- Five minutes.
- Right.

33:14.328 --> 33:18.582
After the cooling system stops, it takes 10
minutes for the power core to go critical.

33:18.665 --> 33:20.876
Gives us 15 minutes
to get back to the gate.

33:20.959 --> 33:23.003
Whatever.

33:27.716 --> 33:29.927
(Carter) Did you get the naqahdah?

33:31.345 --> 33:33.722
(breathlessly) It's in the pack.

33:33.847 --> 33:35.891
Good. Let's go.

33:36.016 --> 33:39.520
Actually, it's, uh... it's getting kinda heavy.

33:41.021 --> 33:43.065
(thud)

33:46.944 --> 33:48.821
Daniel?

33:50.697 --> 33:52.741
- What's going on?
- I can't move.

34:04.586 --> 34:07.339
The armbands are going to
come off on their own?

34:07.422 --> 34:12.219
Data transmitted from their bio-sensors
before they went through the Stargate...

34:12.344 --> 34:15.347
..indicate traces of an antibody.

34:15.764 --> 34:20.226
To the virus... that allowed the devices
to enhance their speed and strength.

34:20.310 --> 34:23.397
We've solved the mystery
of the Ataniks' extinction.

34:23.522 --> 34:27.275
- How so?
- The armbands work for a limited time.

34:27.734 --> 34:32.281
Once the immunity spread among Atanik
warriors, the armbands would be useless.

34:32.364 --> 34:36.909
- I guess they never solved the problem.
- Which means SG-1 is likely on a planet...

34:36.994 --> 34:41.039
..full of armed Jaffa with an advantage
that could disappear at any time?

34:41.123 --> 34:42.666
Yes, sir.

34:47.337 --> 34:50.090
General, for what it's worth,
Anise and I are sorry.

34:50.174 --> 34:53.927
We were not aware of the mission
prior to our arrival here.

34:57.139 --> 34:59.850
(as Anise) I do hope SG-1 returns safely.

35:04.563 --> 35:06.607
Hak! Kree!

35:12.279 --> 35:15.616
All right. You got us. Don't... "kree".

35:31.298 --> 35:34.885
It seems my assistance
was required after all.

35:35.010 --> 35:37.054
Yes. Thank you.

35:37.179 --> 35:40.599
- What happened?
- You passed out. Your armband came off.

35:42.768 --> 35:48.232
We gotta move. Teal'c, get Daniel
back through the gate. Carter, with me.

35:55.739 --> 35:57.783
(siren)

36:10.420 --> 36:12.464
(Carter moans)

36:19.304 --> 36:21.181
Carter?

37:12.566 --> 37:14.610
Where are they?

37:16.028 --> 37:18.489
They should have been right behind us.

37:18.614 --> 37:20.657
Continue on, Daniel Jackson.

37:38.675 --> 37:40.552
Sir?

37:45.057 --> 37:46.517
Colonel?

37:46.600 --> 37:48.644
(groans)

37:56.276 --> 37:58.320
Should've brought more snacks.

38:00.739 --> 38:03.367
I don't think that would've helped.

38:04.326 --> 38:06.370
01 .56.

38:13.293 --> 38:15.671
Sir, you've gotta get outta here.

38:15.796 --> 38:17.840
So do you.

38:18.882 --> 38:21.802
I am not leaving, Daniel Jackson.

38:21.885 --> 38:24.596
Well, I'm not suggesting we should.

38:25.055 --> 38:27.808
- There is no way in there to help them.
- No.

38:44.783 --> 38:48.954
Ten minutes after that C4 goes,
this whole mountain is gonna explode.

38:49.037 --> 38:51.415
I am aware of that.

38:53.167 --> 38:57.337
So the fact that we're staying is based
on a completely informed decision.

38:58.839 --> 39:00.883
It is.

39:01.008 --> 39:03.051
Yeah. Just making sure.

39:10.100 --> 39:11.560
Sir...

39:11.768 --> 39:13.812
Sir, there's no time.

39:13.937 --> 39:16.398
(movement ofarmour)

39:18.358 --> 39:20.402
(siren)

39:22.571 --> 39:24.615
Here goes.

39:30.370 --> 39:32.414
(explosion)

39:35.584 --> 39:38.045
- Did you see that?
- Let's go!

39:39.254 --> 39:41.298
Carter, forget that! Leave it!

39:46.011 --> 39:48.055
The shield is down.

39:51.058 --> 39:53.519
Come on, let's go! Move! Move! Move!

39:53.644 --> 39:58.690
- I told you guys to get back to that gate!
- Yeah. Teal'c wouldn't leave.

40:04.446 --> 40:06.490
Less than a minute!

40:09.993 --> 40:11.703
Down!

41:02.087 --> 41:04.131
(alarm)

41:29.406 --> 41:32.409
Just remember, I retired.
You wanted me back.

41:33.660 --> 41:36.914
- (Hammond) Colonel, are you all OK?
- I think so.

41:37.039 --> 41:40.042
- We will be.
- I am very well, General Hammond.

41:41.668 --> 41:43.712
What happened?

41:43.837 --> 41:46.465
The damn armbands fell off
is what happened.

41:46.548 --> 41:48.592
I am sorry.

41:48.717 --> 41:51.970
- Did you destroy the ship?
- Indeed we did, General Hammond.

41:52.095 --> 41:54.139
Good. Report to the infirmary.

41:54.264 --> 41:56.058
Uh, General... Sir?

41:58.477 --> 42:01.438
About the obviously impending
court martials...

42:01.522 --> 42:07.110
You were under the influence of an alien
technology. That's a pretty solid defence.

42:07.194 --> 42:09.238
Even so, I'm...

42:09.905 --> 42:12.533
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

42:12.783 --> 42:14.827
Me three.

42:17.871 --> 42:19.915
I have no need to apologise.

42:21.083 --> 42:23.961
Teal'c was actually following orders.

42:25.045 --> 42:26.755
Of course he was.

42:27.089 --> 42:29.550
You left the armbands behind.

42:29.675 --> 42:32.636
- We had other things on our mind.
- Understandable.
