WEBVTT

00:03.655 --> 00:04.004
.

00:04.047 --> 00:06.136
- Police! Freeze!

00:07.790 --> 00:10.053
- I wasn't at that drug house
to do a buy bust.

00:10.097 --> 00:12.795
I was there
to score oxy for me.

00:12.838 --> 00:14.536
- I'm gonna help
get you through this.

00:15.754 --> 00:17.713
Hey, put her on the phone!

00:19.454 --> 00:21.630
- I think someone
just kidnapped my daughter.

00:21.673 --> 00:23.327
It's Daddy, it's Daddy.
I'm here.

00:23.371 --> 00:24.676
Eva, can you hear me?

00:24.720 --> 00:27.201
- Just give me
five minutes with him.

00:29.377 --> 00:31.466
She was good.

00:34.556 --> 00:35.513
- What the hell
are we gonna do?

00:35.557 --> 00:37.037
- Hey, look at me.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.343
Be honest, when
was the last time you used?

00:39.387 --> 00:40.431
- Today.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.129
Just a few hours ago.

00:46.350 --> 00:47.786
- All right.
Antonio, listen.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.440
We gotta get you out of here.
Take your gun.

00:49.484 --> 00:51.094
Take your gun.
Okay.

00:51.138 --> 00:53.444
Now give me your phone and go.

00:53.488 --> 00:55.185
It's all right.
I got this.

00:55.229 --> 00:56.665
Now go.
It's okay.

00:56.708 --> 00:58.406
Go.
- Yeah.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.105
All right, put this
in your car.

01:02.149 --> 01:03.541
- All right.
- The phone comes up,

01:03.585 --> 01:05.065
you say Antonio left it there

01:05.108 --> 01:06.109
at the beginning of the tour.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.197
- Copy that.

01:07.241 --> 01:09.156
- You arrive on scene.

01:09.199 --> 01:11.288
You came around that corner,
through that door.

01:11.332 --> 01:12.594
You witnessed me
and the offender

01:12.637 --> 01:13.595
engaged
in a physical altercation.

01:13.638 --> 01:15.379
- No, hold on. Hold on.

01:15.423 --> 01:18.121
- Then you witnessed Rizzo--
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:18.165 --> 01:19.731
- You witnessed Rizzo
go over the wall.

01:19.775 --> 01:21.385
- No, no, no.
Boss, no.

01:21.429 --> 01:23.387
- Hey.

01:23.431 --> 01:25.476
You run downstairs.
You attempt to administer aid.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.130
- No, no.
I won't let you

01:27.174 --> 01:28.479
take the fall for this.
- He's unresponsive.

01:28.523 --> 01:29.872
You determined he was dead
on impact.

01:29.915 --> 01:31.482
- No. You're not doing that.
You can't take it.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.397
- The phone.
Then body.

01:33.441 --> 01:35.573
Then attempt to help him.
- They will bury you.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.227
Okay? There is no way
that the department--

01:37.271 --> 01:39.534
- We are not
having a discussion.

01:39.577 --> 01:41.101
Adam.

01:41.144 --> 01:43.320
I need to know right now,
are you with me?

01:45.540 --> 01:47.324
- Of course I'm with you.
- Then you need to go.

01:47.368 --> 01:48.891
Now. Go!

02:01.556 --> 02:08.606
♪

02:22.229 --> 02:29.236
♪

02:41.204 --> 02:42.727
- Yeah.

02:42.771 --> 02:44.816
- Call came in over the zone,
Intelligence in pursuit.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.601
You boys need
a transport vehicle?

02:46.644 --> 02:49.169
- It's over. The offender and I
got into an altercation.

02:49.212 --> 02:50.692
He tried to disarm me.

02:50.735 --> 02:52.259
He didn't make it, so, uh...

02:52.302 --> 02:54.391
Do us a favor.
Roll the crime lab.

02:54.435 --> 02:55.653
I need to talk to IRT

02:55.697 --> 02:57.655
about an officer-involved
death.

02:57.699 --> 02:58.700
Thank you.

03:16.979 --> 03:18.981
- Sarge.
What's going on?

03:19.024 --> 03:20.722
- Officer-involved death.

03:22.550 --> 03:25.335
- You all should probably
get back to the district.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.817
Where's Antonio?
- I called him off.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.210
- I thought he was
on his way here.

03:30.253 --> 03:31.994
- He wasn't here.

03:33.865 --> 03:36.607
All right, you can all
head back to the district.

03:36.651 --> 03:38.870
I don't want any of you
logged in on the crime scene.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.437
You understand?

03:45.573 --> 03:46.878
- Hailey, come on.

03:47.879 --> 03:49.533
Come on.

03:49.577 --> 03:51.448
- You been through
one of these before?

03:51.492 --> 03:52.928
- Yes, sir,
unfortunately, I have, yeah.

03:52.971 --> 03:55.017
- I'll just remind you
that as IRT,

03:55.060 --> 03:56.714
we're here to investigate
the behavior of the offender.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.325
You understand?
You're not on trial.

03:58.368 --> 03:59.804
- I understand.

03:59.848 --> 04:02.372
- Can you tell me
in simple terms what happened?

04:02.416 --> 04:04.418
- I was in hot pursuit
of the offender.

04:04.461 --> 04:06.724
As I closed in I announced
my office several times.

04:06.768 --> 04:08.987
I ordered him to stop.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.859
He did not.
He was non-compliant.

04:10.902 --> 04:12.382
He was violent.
He lunged for me.

04:12.426 --> 04:13.383
For my weapon.

04:13.427 --> 04:15.777
And, in fearing for my life,

04:15.820 --> 04:18.606
I had no choice
but to defend myself.

04:20.042 --> 04:22.740
- No, sir.
It was a physical altercation.

04:22.784 --> 04:26.309
But weapon or no, I did believe
my life was at risk.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.659
- You and your sergeant were
the only ones on the scene?

04:28.703 --> 04:31.445
- Yes, sir.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.577
I need a verbal yes or no.
- No, I'm not injured. No.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.013
- Okay then.

04:35.057 --> 04:36.537
Let's get some pictures.

04:36.580 --> 04:37.973
You gotta piss and blow,
and then, hopefully,

04:38.016 --> 04:39.366
if everything checks out,
that's the last

04:39.409 --> 04:40.367
you'll have to see me.

04:40.410 --> 04:41.368
- Copy that.

04:41.411 --> 04:42.412
- But remember.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.284
I'm the nice one, yeah?

04:44.327 --> 04:46.590
When you get to COPA, they'll
investigate your behavior.

04:46.634 --> 04:49.289
Be clear, be short,

04:49.332 --> 04:51.378
and be dead honest.

04:51.421 --> 04:52.379
- Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

04:52.422 --> 04:53.641
- All right.

04:57.471 --> 04:58.776
- Hey.

04:58.820 --> 04:59.777
You gonna explain
what's going on now?

04:59.821 --> 05:01.083
Where's Antonio?

05:01.126 --> 05:02.563
- Antonio's taking
some time off.

05:02.606 --> 05:04.347
He was on his way there.

05:04.391 --> 05:07.350
- Antonio is gonna be taking
some days with his family.

05:07.394 --> 05:08.699
Ruzek is dealing with

05:08.743 --> 05:11.615
an officer-involved
death investigation.

05:11.659 --> 05:14.836
And that's the last
this team will discuss it.

05:14.879 --> 05:15.967
- Sarge, is he--
- You never have to explain

05:16.011 --> 05:18.318
something you didn't say
or hear.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.451
Is that understood?

05:23.061 --> 05:24.976
- It is.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.501
But I wanna know if Antonio's
gonna be okay.

05:30.025 --> 05:31.983
- Yeah. He will be.

05:32.027 --> 05:34.551
He just--just needs some time.

05:37.728 --> 05:39.948
We all okay now?

05:39.991 --> 05:42.690
- Uh, sorry to interrupt
whatever this is.

05:42.733 --> 05:44.866
There's been another
carjacking downtown.

05:44.909 --> 05:47.521
North Side, broad daylight.
This time the victim died.

05:47.564 --> 05:48.826
She was 18.

05:48.870 --> 05:50.611
Brennan's requesting
you take this one.

05:50.654 --> 05:53.657
- All right, you heard her.
Let's go do our jobs.

05:53.701 --> 05:55.006
Hey, Trudy, um...

05:55.050 --> 05:57.095
we're down two today.

05:57.139 --> 05:58.836
Ride with me to the scene?

05:58.880 --> 06:00.098
- Yeah.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.672
- Hey, Wigand.
- Hey, Sarge.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.631
- Yeah, looks like it.

06:10.674 --> 06:13.024
All the witnesses are saying
that there were two carjackers,

06:13.068 --> 06:15.026
both of them masked and gloved.

06:15.070 --> 06:17.159
It's just like
the other four carjackings.

06:17.202 --> 06:19.379
You know, they waited for her
to step away from the vehicle

06:19.422 --> 06:20.423
and then charged.

06:20.467 --> 06:21.424
You know, only this time--

06:21.468 --> 06:22.686
- She fought back.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.035
- We've got
multiple witnesses.

06:24.079 --> 06:25.689
They say the carjackers
moved fast.

06:25.733 --> 06:27.909
She reacted to the violence.

06:27.952 --> 06:31.042
- Okay, I'm gonna get forensics
to set up a tarp.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.697
- Hey, uh, listen, I want
you to get her hands bagged.

06:33.741 --> 06:36.874
Hopefully you'll find some DNA
under her fingernails.

06:36.918 --> 06:38.528
Girl's parents been notified?

06:38.572 --> 06:40.051
- Patrol's en route
to her house.

06:40.095 --> 06:41.879
- I think you should take it.

06:41.923 --> 06:43.968
Look, this thing's already
gonna be all over the press.

06:44.012 --> 06:46.580
Don't want some rookie cop
confirming their kid's gone.

06:46.623 --> 06:48.538
- Right.
- Thanks.

06:48.582 --> 06:49.583
- Put out an investigative
alert

06:49.626 --> 06:50.584
on the stolen vehicle.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.412
It was a Lexus F type.

06:52.455 --> 06:55.066
Seems like the carjackers
sped directly onto Lake Shore,

06:55.110 --> 06:56.807
probably hooked up
with 94 or 55.

06:56.851 --> 06:58.853
- Talked to a witness
who owns that shop.

06:58.896 --> 07:00.071
Said there's security cameras
that look

07:00.115 --> 07:01.203
directly at the scene.

07:01.246 --> 07:02.683
- Go check it out.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.206
- That's where we're headed.

07:11.866 --> 07:13.868
Camera feed relays
to my laptop.

07:13.911 --> 07:16.479
I'm sure it caught
the whole thing as it happened.

07:16.523 --> 07:17.915
Would have at least
seen the girl.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.439
She...

07:19.482 --> 07:21.092
she was right outside and...

07:21.136 --> 07:23.225
they just...

07:23.268 --> 07:26.576
- Ma'am, you don't have
to watch the footage with us.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.056
- Thank you.

07:28.099 --> 07:31.538
I'll just, uh...be in the back.

07:31.581 --> 07:32.756
- All right.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.639
- Jesus.

07:55.213 --> 07:57.172
- Yeah. They're coming
from the L stop.

08:00.262 --> 08:01.611
- Whoever they are,
they're smart.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.091
They never look up
at the camera once.

08:03.134 --> 08:05.615
But they took the L train
the whole way there.

08:05.659 --> 08:07.487
We were able to trace them
back to the Red Line

08:07.530 --> 08:08.879
and they hopped on
at the 47th Street station.

08:08.923 --> 08:11.012
- Right. They paid cash,
so nothing to trace.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.622
but I'm sending the footage
to the CTA workers.

08:12.666 --> 08:15.233
- 47th Street station.
That's Canaryville.

08:15.277 --> 08:17.627
47th Street's, like, two blocks
from my mom's house.

08:17.671 --> 08:19.150
I got a real good CI there,
Mark Rollins.

08:19.194 --> 08:20.630
Guy I grew up with.

08:20.674 --> 08:21.979
He's working off
a home invasion case.

08:22.023 --> 08:23.590
He's plugged in too.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.200
Runs with Pat Kent's crew
and...

08:25.243 --> 08:27.855
if these carjackers
are Canaryville locals,

08:27.898 --> 08:30.161
Kent'll know about it.

08:30.205 --> 08:32.250
- You know nobody
in Canaryville's gonna

08:32.294 --> 08:35.689
willingly talk to us,
so we do need an angle.

08:35.732 --> 08:37.255
- All right, so dig
into the pattern.

08:37.299 --> 08:40.084
Find the nexus between time
and neighborhood.

08:40.128 --> 08:43.653
And I want a detail posted
on every L stop above Jackson.

08:43.697 --> 08:45.829
And uniformed patrol
sitting on 47th.

08:45.873 --> 08:47.570
We don't let another one
of these happen,

08:47.614 --> 08:50.181
you understand?
- Copy that.

08:50.225 --> 08:51.835
- I'm assuming
it's not news to you

08:51.879 --> 08:54.011
IRT wants you on a short leash.

08:54.055 --> 08:56.013
So you visit your CI with me.

08:56.057 --> 08:57.972
- All right.

08:58.015 --> 08:59.147
- Let's go.

09:09.374 --> 09:12.639
You have no idea
what you just did.

09:14.292 --> 09:15.859
I mean, there could
be witnesses.

09:15.903 --> 09:18.949
Cameras. They could have
caught you on PODS.

09:18.993 --> 09:21.691
Phone records could indicate
Antonio was there.

09:21.735 --> 09:22.953
- I know.
- There could be forensics.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.999
DNA evidence.
- Boss.

09:25.042 --> 09:26.000
- You're not getting
out of the car yet.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.567
- All of that would be there

09:27.610 --> 09:28.959
had you done what I did.
- And who the hell

09:29.003 --> 09:31.092
do you think you are?

09:31.135 --> 09:32.920
You don't protect me.

09:32.963 --> 09:34.574
I protect you.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.619
That's my job.

09:38.099 --> 09:40.188
I'm the one who allowed
Antonio to be there.

09:40.231 --> 09:41.842
This is on me.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.280
From this point on,

09:45.323 --> 09:48.022
you don't say another word
about this, you get me?

09:48.065 --> 09:49.327
- Yes, sir.

09:50.981 --> 09:52.635
- There's a single crack
in this,

09:52.679 --> 09:54.898
this tips sideways,
we're all on the hook.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.770
- Sarge, I did
what I had to do.

09:57.945 --> 09:59.816
I don't know what you want.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.992
- We buried Al six months ago.

10:04.212 --> 10:05.779
- This is not that.

10:18.182 --> 10:18.400
.

10:18.443 --> 10:19.662
- Hey.

10:19.706 --> 10:23.100
- Oh, hell, no.
- Mark.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.189
- I said I'm not working with--
I'm not doing it!

10:25.233 --> 10:26.538
I'm not working with you, man.
- Nice to see you too.

10:26.582 --> 10:27.539
May I remind you
you still have a case

10:27.583 --> 10:29.367
you gotta work off.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.500
- Yeah, I've been working that
off for the last ten months.

10:31.543 --> 10:34.677
You got me snitching
on the whole damn neighborhood.

10:34.721 --> 10:37.071
You sent me those
narco cops last month.

10:37.114 --> 10:39.160
- They were beat cops and they
had one question for you.

10:39.203 --> 10:41.379
- They were idiots.

10:41.423 --> 10:43.555
This is all, uh,
legally personal--legal--

10:43.599 --> 10:44.687
- Would you just calm down,
all right?

10:44.731 --> 10:46.384
We're not here
to search your stuff

10:46.428 --> 10:48.691
and shutting curtains
and slamming doors in my face

10:48.735 --> 10:51.128
isn't gonna stop us if we were.

10:51.172 --> 10:53.304
- Sergeant Hank Voight.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.656
- What, you don't want
to work with me, either?

10:56.699 --> 10:58.570
- Yeah, no.
No thanks.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.094
- Well, see, I think you do.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.312
'Cause I'm the guy
who can actually

11:01.356 --> 11:03.097
get your whole file cleared.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.666
- Yeah.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.842
- And what do I have to do
for you to do that?

11:08.885 --> 11:10.713
- Inform on the carjacking crew

11:10.757 --> 11:13.585
working out of Canaryville.

11:13.629 --> 11:16.719
- What, are they boosting
Saturn twin

11:20.157 --> 11:22.725
I don't know any crews
jacking cars. Sorry.

11:24.379 --> 11:26.163
- Yeah, that's literally
what I just said.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.469
- Okay.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.776
Well, you know anyone
who might know?

11:29.819 --> 11:31.386
Pat Kent?

11:32.517 --> 11:34.128
- You gotta be kidding me.

11:34.171 --> 11:36.391
- You inform on this one thing,

11:36.434 --> 11:39.089
you get Pat to give us
something, and you're done.

11:39.133 --> 11:40.264
All right? You're off the hook.

11:40.308 --> 11:42.136
No more me, no more cops,
nothing.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.402
- No.

11:47.445 --> 11:48.533
No thanks.

11:48.577 --> 11:49.665
- Okay, well,

11:49.709 --> 11:51.580
consider your case still open.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.800
I got a lot of friends
who'd love to talk to you.

11:55.279 --> 11:56.846
- Okay. Fine, fine, fine, fine.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.543
What do you--What do I
gotta do?

11:58.587 --> 12:01.372
Just tell me.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.679
What?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.768
- You go in, you push Pat
for info.

12:05.812 --> 12:08.728
But be smart, subtle.
Don't push too hard.

12:08.771 --> 12:10.207
This phone is your wire.

12:10.251 --> 12:11.905
We'll be outside listening.

12:11.948 --> 12:14.777
We'll also be hacked into their
surveillance cam for eyes.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.692
We can have a ghost
in there for you.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.738
Someone under, you won't
even know they're there.

12:23.394 --> 12:24.700
- If one of the two of you

12:24.744 --> 12:26.354
starts slinking
around Canaryville,

12:26.397 --> 12:29.226
there's no way in hell
no one notices.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.662
But I have a second idea.

12:30.706 --> 12:33.448
Um, I don't even use a wire.

12:33.491 --> 12:35.145
Right, yeah, so I just--

12:35.189 --> 12:37.321
I go in and I talk
to a couple people.

12:37.365 --> 12:39.410
I'll get you a little info
and...

12:39.454 --> 12:41.151
you know, we'd all
be real happy.

12:41.195 --> 12:43.719
- No, see,
I talked to Adam.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.548
And he said he's known you
for, like, a long time.

12:46.591 --> 12:48.202
And you're getting a wire.

12:48.245 --> 12:49.333
- That's cute.

12:49.377 --> 12:50.508
- Uh, this is up and running,

12:50.552 --> 12:51.553
so I'm gonna
let everybody know.

12:51.596 --> 12:52.946
- All right.
- Cool.

12:54.904 --> 12:57.689
- We, uh...we grew up
around the block.

12:57.733 --> 12:58.778
- Yeah.

13:00.736 --> 13:03.695
- No. No, not really.
You know...

13:03.739 --> 13:05.610
it's only in Chicago
a kid like Adam

13:05.654 --> 13:07.569
can grow up and become a cop.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.355
Do you...

13:11.399 --> 13:13.793
have time for coffee, or--
- Move.

13:17.405 --> 13:20.277
Are you really okay
with all this?

13:21.452 --> 13:22.889
- With not knowing why Ruzek's

13:22.932 --> 13:24.978
staring down the barrel
of an OID?

13:26.762 --> 13:29.547
- I don't know if I'm okay
with any of it.

13:29.591 --> 13:33.856
But I think the best way
to protect everyone

13:33.900 --> 13:35.815
is to not talk about it.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.779
- Hey there, Mark.
- Mark's here. We're up.

13:43.823 --> 13:44.824
- Hey.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.480
- You know we got police heat
all up on 47th?

13:49.524 --> 13:51.221
- What the hell
are you talking about?

13:51.265 --> 13:53.528
- The two cops in full uniform
sitting at the stop

13:53.571 --> 13:54.616
like their asses are on fire.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.706
- Yeah.
- No idea.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.795
- They're, like, a lick away
from pulling a stop and frisk.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.405
Who the hell's
bringing the heat?

14:01.449 --> 14:02.754
- I don't know.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.844
- Someone should
probably find out.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.671
- Yeah.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.990
- You going
to Becker's tonight?

14:21.034 --> 14:22.644
Valerie said she's only going
if you go.

14:26.648 --> 14:27.910
- You want me
to talk to someone?

14:27.954 --> 14:30.652
- No. It's good.

14:31.958 --> 14:34.569
- Pricks apparently been
out there for, like, 12 hours.

14:34.612 --> 14:35.918
- Jesus. We gotta be ready
to pull this guy.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.615
- I know they're gonna
get bored.

14:37.659 --> 14:39.835
Start pulling their weight
with pat downs.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.532
No one's gonna wanna go in
with possession--

14:41.576 --> 14:43.317
- It's fine.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.622
I'll talk to Billy.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.539
- Clearing. Chop shop.
- Yeah.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.498
- Did I not just say
it was good?

14:56.678 --> 14:58.636
- Question.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.377
How the hell are you okay
with the fact

15:00.421 --> 15:01.813
that the girl
you want to screw

15:01.857 --> 15:04.729
will only go to this
house party if I'm there?

15:08.081 --> 15:09.996
- She only likes you there
as a buffer, all right?

15:10.039 --> 15:11.954
- I think she wants me there
'cause she likes me, Coop.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.651
- She said she wouldn't
even kiss him

15:13.695 --> 15:15.479
'cause it might ruin
their friendship.

15:15.523 --> 15:18.352
- He's known her for
three days, what friendship?

15:22.747 --> 15:24.358
- Ah, man.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.839
- Wasn't quite
what we talked about.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.974
- This Billy's place,
is that Billy Cowan?

15:32.018 --> 15:33.845
Owns an auto repair on 45th?

15:33.889 --> 15:36.457
Guessing that's an
off

15:36.500 --> 15:38.633
- Crack team.

15:38.676 --> 15:40.417
- I'll take that
as a confirmation.

15:40.461 --> 15:41.766
Your COH.

15:45.640 --> 15:46.989
That was a dumbass way
to press for info.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.817
- No it wasn't.

15:48.860 --> 15:51.776
Not when everyone in there
knows you've got their back.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.743
- That's me.
How can I help you?

16:01.786 --> 16:03.701
- Right here, buddy.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.749
I gotta say, Billy, you do not
look surprised to see us.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.011
He doesn't look surprised,
does he?

16:09.055 --> 16:10.012
- Yeah, well,
that's because he knows

16:10.056 --> 16:11.405
we're not gonna cause a scene.

16:11.448 --> 16:12.754
Unless he doesn't want
to talk to us.

16:12.797 --> 16:15.670
- Not sure how I can help you.
- Oh.

16:15.713 --> 16:17.889
- Well, I think we all know
that there's a few ways

16:17.933 --> 16:18.890
this can go down.

16:18.934 --> 16:19.891
We can search the shop,

16:19.935 --> 16:21.154
talk to people, get loud,

16:21.197 --> 16:23.721
tear this place up
piece by piece, or...

16:23.765 --> 16:25.375
- Or you can give us
something better.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.116
- Trade up.
Name of the game, Billy.

16:27.160 --> 16:28.683
- Who's dropping off
the luxury cars

16:28.726 --> 16:30.902
you're chopping, Billy?

16:30.946 --> 16:32.730
- I don't run
that kind of shop.

16:32.774 --> 16:35.516
- Oh, okay.

16:35.559 --> 16:37.039
5021 Eddie, we're gonna need
an assist

16:37.083 --> 16:39.389
on executing a search warrant,
1432 West 45h--

16:39.433 --> 16:40.869
- Look, I don't know any names,
all right?

16:40.912 --> 16:42.827
Okay.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.138
- I don't ask people
for their names.

16:49.182 --> 16:51.140
- Billy.

16:51.184 --> 16:52.750
You're trying my patience here.

16:52.794 --> 16:53.925
- She's gonna need a name, man.

16:53.969 --> 16:57.146
- All right.
All right, okay?

16:57.190 --> 16:58.930
He drops off the cars.

16:58.974 --> 17:01.759
I give him the cash same night
and clear them out.

17:01.803 --> 17:03.631
I ain't got any of them here.

17:05.894 --> 17:07.939
- I really don't know his name.

17:07.983 --> 17:10.855
But I'm not a damn idiot.

17:10.899 --> 17:13.554
I got contingencies
for if something happens.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.470
- Of course you do.

17:17.688 --> 17:19.081
- Our friend Billy
installed his own camera.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.691
Said this is the guy
right here

17:20.735 --> 17:22.084
that comes in
and drops the cars off.

17:22.128 --> 17:23.607
Comes in alone,
drops 'em,

17:23.651 --> 17:25.000
and Billy pays him cash
same day.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.915
- Billy didn't know his ID,
license plate,

17:26.958 --> 17:28.830
any identifying markers, so.

17:28.873 --> 17:30.440
- That's the best shot we got.
- Yeah.

17:30.484 --> 17:32.181
- All right, so we do it
the old-fashioned way.

17:32.225 --> 17:33.574
Farm it off.

17:33.617 --> 17:34.966
Every beat cop, CTA worker,

17:35.010 --> 17:36.968
get every gang and tact unit
across the city.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.622
If someone knows this guy,

17:38.666 --> 17:40.624
that picture's gonna be
enough to spark it.

17:40.668 --> 17:42.104
Hey, you can run it past Mark.
- All right.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.932
- He should be around here.
Hey.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.803
Hank, this is
Detective Tim Powell.

17:45.847 --> 17:46.891
- Hank.
- Powell.

17:48.023 --> 17:49.590
I'm with IRT.

17:49.633 --> 17:52.549
I'm taking over your
officer-involved death.

17:54.769 --> 17:56.118
- Let's talk downstairs.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.641
- Yes, sir.

18:10.350 --> 18:10.567
.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.961
- We did full forensics
at the crime scene.

18:14.702 --> 18:17.008
Found some blood on the wall.

18:17.052 --> 18:18.967
- Huh. Well...

18:19.010 --> 18:20.186
as I stated at the scene,

18:20.229 --> 18:21.491
there was a hell
of an altercation.

18:21.535 --> 18:22.579
So it's possible Rizzo
was injured

18:22.623 --> 18:24.277
before he went over the wall.

18:24.320 --> 18:27.149
- Blood wasn't Rizzo's.
Unidentified profile.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.585
- Huh.

18:28.629 --> 18:30.500
- Just as a reminder,
you said at the scene

18:30.544 --> 18:32.023
that you were not injured.

18:32.067 --> 18:33.416
Photographs we took
confirm that.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.157
- No, I didn't believe so,
but, you know.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.245
It's possible.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.117
- Okay.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.509
So you have no idea
who could have left

18:39.553 --> 18:40.684
the fresh blood at the scene?

18:40.728 --> 18:42.121
- No, sir.

18:43.731 --> 18:44.993
- All right.

18:45.036 --> 18:46.429
Thank you.
- Thank you.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.440
- You are gonna talk to me.
- No, I'm not.

18:57.484 --> 18:59.181
You have to stay out of it.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.140
Please.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.750
- I don't care what
we're supposed to do.

19:02.793 --> 19:04.447
What Voight told you.

19:04.491 --> 19:06.449
You have to tell me
what's going on right now.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.277
And don't give me some of this
police loyalty,

19:08.321 --> 19:10.671
blue line brotherhood--
- Stop. Stop.

19:12.455 --> 19:15.197
You think those are things
I just believe in theory?

19:15.241 --> 19:18.461
These are just nice words
I toss around?

19:18.505 --> 19:20.376
- Adam.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.770
Please tell me you didn't do
what I think you did.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.650
Are you insane?

19:35.609 --> 19:39.308
There are a thousand ways
this goes wrong.

19:39.352 --> 19:42.442
A thousand ways you end up
on the wrong end of this.

19:42.485 --> 19:44.226
If IRT came to question you,

19:44.270 --> 19:47.186
that means there's
discrepancies in your story.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.405
You are risking your career.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.451
Jail time.
- I know.

19:51.494 --> 19:53.496
- Your life.

19:53.540 --> 19:54.758
For what?

19:54.802 --> 19:56.412
Some half-assed notion
of loyalty?

19:56.456 --> 19:59.241
- It is not a notion.

20:01.374 --> 20:04.072
It's Antonio.
It's Voight.

20:04.115 --> 20:06.030
It's our unit.

20:06.074 --> 20:07.684
It's our unit...

20:07.728 --> 20:09.817
and I'm gonna protect it
every time.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.123
Every time.

20:12.167 --> 20:13.473
That's who I am.

20:13.516 --> 20:14.648
Why do you have
a problem with that?

20:14.691 --> 20:16.258
- I don't have a problem
with that.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.825
I have a problem with something
happening to you.

20:17.868 --> 20:20.262
- No, you have a problem
with my damn ethics, Hailey.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.221
You always have
had a problem with that

20:22.264 --> 20:23.787
and I'm not gonna talk
about policing with you again--

20:23.831 --> 20:26.486
- Listen! This has nothing
to do with police loyalty.

20:26.529 --> 20:28.270
It has to do with you.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.359
I care about you.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.535
I care about you, and I...

20:37.366 --> 20:39.716
- I could hear you guys
in the stairwell.

20:39.760 --> 20:40.848
What the hell are you doing?

20:42.589 --> 20:45.113
- Nothing. It's fine.
Sorry.

20:47.724 --> 20:50.336
- You cannot be having
this conversation here.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.381
And we're supposed to be out
securing an ID.

21:00.824 --> 21:07.875
♪

21:19.234 --> 21:20.540
I thought we were done
with this.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.368
- I'm not in the mood
today, all right?

21:22.411 --> 21:24.283
I just need you to look
at a picture.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.373
You know this guy?

21:30.637 --> 21:32.508
No, I've never seen him.

21:32.552 --> 21:34.249
- You've never seen him.
That's the truth?

21:34.293 --> 21:35.468
- Yeah. Sorry.

21:35.511 --> 21:37.121
I don't know who that is.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.167
- You're such a bad liar.
No, no, no.

21:39.210 --> 21:40.342
Sit down.

21:41.909 --> 21:44.694
- You can't force me to--
- I can if I don't believe you.

21:44.738 --> 21:45.913
Who the hell is he?

21:47.697 --> 21:49.612
Look, I get you don't want
to be here.

21:49.656 --> 21:51.614
I get you don't want
to be doing this.

21:51.658 --> 21:54.313
This is the last time, I swear.

21:54.356 --> 21:55.792
You can't play
by the Canaryville code

21:55.836 --> 21:56.793
on this one, Mark.

21:56.837 --> 21:58.360
All right

21:58.404 --> 22:00.667
They beat a woman and then
they shot her twice.

22:00.710 --> 22:02.799
And they left her dead
on the side of the road.

22:02.843 --> 22:05.454
She was 18 years old.

22:05.498 --> 22:06.847
So whatever you got
for this guy,

22:06.890 --> 22:08.849
I don't think
it's got anything on her.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.157
- I thought he was a good guy.

22:13.201 --> 22:14.637
- He's not a good guy.

22:14.681 --> 22:15.943
- Yeah, well, I don't know him
that well.

22:15.986 --> 22:17.640
I don't even know his name.

22:17.684 --> 22:20.556
I just--I've seen him around.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.689
He, uh, he's from out of town.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.430
Indiana, I think.

22:24.473 --> 22:26.649
- Do you know
where he's staying?

22:26.693 --> 22:28.869
- Some vacants off Pershing.

22:31.393 --> 22:32.481
- That helps.

22:33.874 --> 22:35.441
Hey.

22:35.484 --> 22:37.225
Thank you.

22:41.011 --> 22:42.404
- Hey.

22:42.448 --> 22:43.927
- No.

22:43.971 --> 22:45.494
Everyone's saying they've
never seen him before.

22:45.538 --> 22:47.278
Uh, I'm gonna take
the last four houses.

22:47.322 --> 22:48.889
Why don't you meet up
with Atwater and Burgess?

22:48.932 --> 22:50.412
They're still working
Peoria Street.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.240
We should expand the area.

22:52.283 --> 22:53.894
- 2113 squad, we have
an on-view carjacking.

22:53.937 --> 22:55.504

22:55.548 --> 22:56.940
- Go, 2113.

her face beat in

29:49.831 --> 29:51.311

But I have no
clear answer for you.

29:54.705 --> 29:57.056
There's no surveillance
footage. No PODS.

29:57.099 --> 29:59.101
We've yet to scrum up
a single witness.

29:59.145 --> 30:00.799
And the blood on the scene's
gonna be a problem.

30:00.842 --> 30:03.323

to file a search warrant

30:03.366 --> 30:04.759
for Ruzek's blood.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.675
- I know.
And it's not gonna match.

30:07.718 --> 30:10.417
From there it's how far
COPA wants to dig in.

30:10.460 --> 30:12.288
Listen.

30:12.332 --> 30:14.769
File's still open.
I'm on lead.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.293
I'd be willing
to make some changes.

30:17.337 --> 30:18.686
You and Adam come in,
we sit down,

30:18.729 --> 30:22.342
we rework the case,
the evidence.

30:22.385 --> 30:24.213
You both tell me the truth.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.652

on the books.

30:30.263 --> 30:31.786
- I'll talk to Adam.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.875
Thank you.

30:33.919 --> 30:36.791

it's out of my hands.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.402
This is the very best I'm gonna
be able to do for you.

30:40.577 --> 30:43.189
- Appreciate it.

30:43.232 --> 30:44.668
- Thanks, Tim.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.462
- Yeah.

30:56.811 --> 30:58.291
And you're gonna do it.

30:58.334 --> 31:00.119
- It's not that simple.
- Yeah, it is.

31:00.162 --> 31:01.598
Yeah, it is.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.732
Adam, you go to COPA,

31:06.299 --> 31:08.910
I mean, things could go
way wrong.

31:12.740 --> 31:14.263
It's an election year.

31:14.307 --> 31:16.787
COPA ain't gonna be
taking it easy on police.

31:16.831 --> 31:19.225
Just walk it back now.

31:19.268 --> 31:20.661
Say it was me.

31:20.704 --> 31:22.924
- Of course.
- Rizzo reached for your gun.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.839
Listen to me.

31:24.883 --> 31:27.407
I intervened, we got
into a physical altercation.

31:27.450 --> 31:28.843
He went over.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.671
Just put me on the hook.

31:30.714 --> 31:32.847
- If I do that, then you're
standing right where I am.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.762
Antonio's still at risk
of losing his job.

31:34.805 --> 31:36.459
And you're at risk
of losing yours.

31:36.503 --> 31:39.767
And if you go down, Boss,
the entire--

31:39.810 --> 31:41.900
The entire unit goes down.

31:43.379 --> 31:45.381
- I can handle this.

31:49.995 --> 31:51.561
How could you handle it?

32:00.005 --> 32:01.745
- Adam, if...

32:03.008 --> 32:04.835
if you go to COPA,

32:04.879 --> 32:06.750
