00:13.080 --> 00:15.000


00:19.440 --> 00:21.200
Bedroom clear!

00:24.680 --> 00:25.680
Bathroom clear!

00:33.880 --> 00:35.280
Yeah, yeah, stop.

00:42.760 --> 00:43.880
This one!

00:43.960 --> 00:45.120
Oi!

01:36.760 --> 01:40.800


01:40.880 --> 01:45.720


01:45.800 --> 01:51.200


01:51.280 --> 01:55.320


01:55.400 --> 01:58.720


01:58.800 --> 02:00.800


02:00.880 --> 02:03.400


02:03.480 --> 02:05.520


02:05.600 --> 02:07.000


02:07.080 --> 02:11.480


02:21.960 --> 02:23.560
We should try this one day.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.160


02:25.240 --> 02:27.800
I don't think yoga's your thing,
really, is it?

02:27.880 --> 02:29.160


02:29.240 --> 02:31.680
And anyway, we're far too grown-up

02:31.760 --> 02:34.960
to pretend that this is
anything other than what it is.

02:36.640 --> 02:37.680
And what is this?

02:41.520 --> 02:42.360
How do I look?

02:45.280 --> 02:46.120
Awful.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.880
So awful

02:51.880 --> 02:53.400
I might just have to rip it off you.

02:53.480 --> 02:54.320
No, no, no, no!

02:54.400 --> 02:56.800
-No, no, no!
-No, come on, in! In you pop! Get in!

02:56.880 --> 02:58.480


03:04.000 --> 03:06.880


03:08.520 --> 03:10.680
-
-How can you forget a cello?

03:10.760 --> 03:12.800
-I've got a lot on my mind.
-You're 11.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.000
You have literally nothing on your mind.

03:15.080 --> 03:17.920
It's right there. Where are you going now?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.240
-My bow.
-Give me strength.

03:21.640 --> 03:25.120
-I need my phone back.
-No, you need to watch your tone.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.880
-Mum?
-Uh, what did we take it away for again?

03:28.960 --> 03:31.400
Your chores are not optional.
That's why we have the list.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.880
-Since when have I ever done my chores?
-Exactly.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.720
-It was in my tennis racket case.
-Of course.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.080
-Hey!

03:37.160 --> 03:39.960
-Shit, I'm gonna be late.
-Language!

03:42.120 --> 03:45.240
Babe, promise me
that you will get to the church early.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.400
I will be on time.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.920
I mean, really on time,
based on objective numbers on clocks,

03:50.000 --> 03:52.040
not on Megan Standard Time.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.520
-When have I ever let you down?

03:54.600 --> 03:56.680
-Today is important.
-Okay.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.000
Mmm.

03:59.080 --> 04:00.680
-Bye.
-Okay.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.640
-Bye!
-See ya.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.640
-Where are you going?

04:09.480 --> 04:10.320
Work called.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.680
They need somebody in. Back in an hour.

04:59.280 --> 05:03.560
So, why is there a suitcase of cash
in your basement?

05:06.200 --> 05:07.920
Is it Stewart's money? Is he back?

05:08.720 --> 05:09.560
Sarah?

05:10.520 --> 05:13.960
Cash in the basement,
it's not exactly normal banking procedure.

05:15.280 --> 05:18.920
It just showed up, uh,
a couple of weeks after Stewart was gone.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.360
Sarah! Stop that.

05:21.120 --> 05:21.960
Tell me.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.240
Niall was having one of his tantrums,

05:29.920 --> 05:34.560
um, and so I just went outside
to get a breath of fresh air, and…

05:37.280 --> 05:38.600
it was just sitting there.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.640
In the log store.

05:43.720 --> 05:45.240
I know I should have called you.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.400
-But I panicked.
-Why?

05:49.160 --> 05:50.240
Um…

05:51.080 --> 05:52.440
I… I was desperate.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.640
Stewart had always taken care
of all the money side of things.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.560
Suddenly I had all these companies
calling me, asking me for payments,

05:58.640 --> 06:01.080
and… and the mortgage was late and… and…

06:03.280 --> 06:04.520
and then I kept it.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.280
-Just in case--
-It didn't just show up.

06:08.760 --> 06:10.560
-I know.
-It might have been Stewart.

06:11.080 --> 06:14.400
He could have left it there for you,
to make sure you were looked after.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.600
I've already told you,
Stewart would not have left us.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.080
Those boys meant the world to him.
Something happened to him.

06:19.160 --> 06:22.240
So all this money turns up,
and you don't ask any questions?

06:22.320 --> 06:24.560
I did ask plenty of questions,
but I just needed the money

06:24.640 --> 06:26.800
more than I needed to know
where the money had come from.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.080
-Please don't tell anyone about this.
-Oh, Sarah.

06:32.880 --> 06:35.360
Whoever left it clearly didn't need it.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.440
Otherwise they would have
come looking for it.

06:37.520 --> 06:41.080
And I like having it around,
just in case something goes wrong again.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.000
We've kept our secrets before.

06:47.480 --> 06:48.440
What's one more?

06:56.040 --> 06:58.640
-£10 million for a new police station.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.960
You'd think they'd put in a door
that works.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.240
-Morning.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.840
Hang on, you're wearing
the spare shirt from your car.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.800
And you're eating one of the bagels
you were obsessed with

07:10.880 --> 07:12.400
when you were seeing Sarah Green.

07:12.480 --> 07:15.760
How many times do I have to tell you?
That finished years ago. Hm?

07:16.760 --> 07:19.800
Okay, look, so I'm seeing Lorraine.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.360
I… I don't know
if I'm "seeing her" seeing her, but…

07:23.840 --> 07:25.920
It doesn't matter.
We're not having this conversation.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.040
We just did.

07:28.800 --> 07:29.840
What's that?

07:29.920 --> 07:33.320
I checked out Cassie's car reg.
Did you know she's changed her name?

07:33.400 --> 07:34.920
She is now Megan Pierce.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.440
She's got a whole new,
perfect "mum does yoga" life now.

07:38.520 --> 07:42.120
Well, not surprising.
You know, she wanted to start over.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.400
Yeah, no, it's
perfectly normal behavior, that.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.560
Run away, change your name,
start a new life

07:46.640 --> 07:48.080
straight after a man disappears.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.920
There's nothing suspicious
about that at all.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.880
Yeah. All these missing men,

07:52.480 --> 07:56.280
it all started with Stewart Green.
We need to dig deeper into him.

07:56.360 --> 07:59.200
-He's got something to do with this.
-But where's the evidence?

07:59.720 --> 08:03.120
This Cassie-slash-Megan,
who I don't remotely trust, by the way,

08:03.200 --> 08:05.920
simply saying he's alive,
it's not enough, is it?

08:07.120 --> 08:10.520
Come on. There's something
Goldberg wants us to look into.

08:13.240 --> 08:14.240
Oh, good.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.200
"Pink Poirots"?

08:17.280 --> 08:22.160
Yep, it's a group of women
who trace missing men online. They're…

08:22.760 --> 08:25.040
-Busybodies?
-Uh, social media detectives.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.880
They set up fake accounts

08:26.960 --> 08:30.920
and connect with friends, family,
and basically anyone who posted something

08:31.000 --> 08:34.560
or taken photos
around the time someone disappeared.

08:34.640 --> 08:38.320
And now…
…they're looking into Carlton Flynn.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.120
Everyone needs a hobby.
What's it got to do with us?

08:43.120 --> 08:45.880
-I am not asking civilians for help.
-Oh, come on.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.840
We're not exactly GCHQ, are we?

08:47.920 --> 08:51.000
It would take Leanne months
to comb through the social media accounts

08:51.080 --> 08:53.400
of everyone in the area
the night they disappeared.

08:53.480 --> 08:54.360
Jeez.

08:54.440 --> 08:57.000
Look, it's no different
from askin' some old biddy

08:57.080 --> 08:59.080
what she's seen
peekin' out of her curtains.

09:03.200 --> 09:07.440
Tell you what, how about we do this first,
and then we can look into your thing?

09:21.880 --> 09:23.240
Not open yet…

09:30.840 --> 09:32.440
You look pretty good for a dead woman.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.120
-Is that a compliment?
-No.

09:38.080 --> 09:41.960
It's an… it's an… an acknowledgment
of the fact that we thought you were dead.

09:43.840 --> 09:46.280
And by "we," I mean me and Ray,

09:47.760 --> 09:52.280
the supposed love of your life,
who, apparently, you extreme ghosted.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.880
I knew you'd still be here.

09:56.800 --> 10:00.760
Well, I'm not just here.
I have a… a portfolio career.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.520
Whatever. I don't have to explain myself
to a corpse.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.480
Look, are you gonna give me
Ray's number or not?

10:08.560 --> 10:09.440
Not.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.320
-Why not?
-He hath forsaken you.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.160
What?

10:13.240 --> 10:15.600
You blinded his eyes
and hardened his heart.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.720
Se… seriously?

10:17.760 --> 10:23.000
Like my boy JC says, "Though it be a pain
in my arse, I healed the brokenhearted."

10:23.080 --> 10:23.920
Okay.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.000
I get it.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.680
But it's not up to you if he sees me.

10:30.800 --> 10:31.800
Yeah, but, Cass,

10:32.720 --> 10:35.800
I'm the one that has to pick up the pieces
once you piss off again.

10:36.680 --> 10:37.520
Aren't I?

10:41.240 --> 10:42.080
Yeah.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.520
Look, I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't important.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.080
Just ask him to meet me.

10:53.000 --> 10:53.960
Fester, please.

10:57.040 --> 10:57.880
Where?

11:04.200 --> 11:05.960
Let's see where she goes now.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.680
Come on, Bea! Go, go, go!

11:14.680 --> 11:16.040
Pink Poirots?

11:17.240 --> 11:19.400
Is this what policing's come to? Jeez.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.920
-<i>Yeah?</i>
-Hi. Is that… is that Priya Suwal?

11:27.520 --> 11:28.680
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:28.760 --> 11:31.760
Hi, um, I'm Detective Cartwright.
This is Detective Broome.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.520
We just wondered if we could come in.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.520
-<i>Priya!</i>
-<i>I'll be up in a minute, Mum!</i>

11:36.600 --> 11:37.880
-<i>Pri?</i>
-<i>I'm busy.</i>

11:37.960 --> 11:39.000
<i>Priya!</i>

11:39.080 --> 11:40.000
So are we.

11:40.080 --> 11:43.120
Yeah, but I… I think, um…
I think you could really help us.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.160
You're not the first of your sort

11:53.240 --> 11:56.000
to sit in that chair
and call me all kinds of things.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.880
Vigilante, citizen warrior.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.760
Sherlock was an amateur.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.440
He was also famously not real.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.400
You've got no proof whatsoever

12:05.480 --> 12:09.200
that I've got even the slightest bit
of evidence about Carlton.

12:10.680 --> 12:13.800
Unless you have a warrant,
I need to be getting on.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.120
Well, how… how about…

12:16.840 --> 12:19.360
how about we collaborate?

12:19.440 --> 12:20.560
Hmm?

12:20.640 --> 12:23.880
Oh, we could be
the… the Lestrade to your Sherlock.

12:24.520 --> 12:25.520
My dad was a fan.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.240
I'll be there in a minute, Mum!

12:31.320 --> 12:33.040
Jesus.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.040
Wow.

12:35.120 --> 12:38.680
Oh! She's printed out
all of these social media photos,

12:38.760 --> 12:39.800
and you were right.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.960
Carlton Flynn was in Vipers all along.

12:42.480 --> 12:44.080
This goes back years.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.800
And all the missing men were connected,
like I said.

12:48.880 --> 12:51.480
We need to find
this girl in the orange coat.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.520
She's all over it.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.160
We're idiots. Look at this.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.920
Look, how did we not see this?

13:07.400 --> 13:10.600
All the missing men
disappeared on different dates in April.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.040
The third Friday of the month.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.080
It's Carnival.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.400
It's an easy night
to make someone disappear.

13:20.000 --> 13:20.960
All except this one.

13:21.640 --> 13:25.640
Zain Kaleed.
His body was discovered in the woods.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.760
This fella, Jamal Alade, went down for it.

13:29.480 --> 13:33.320
Says he had a fight with the murdered man
on the night of Carnival

13:34.320 --> 13:35.360
in 2003.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.320
Which would mean Stewart wasn't the first.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.120
How did we miss this guy?

14:24.960 --> 14:25.960
Wow.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.240
-Cassie.

15:07.000 --> 15:07.920
You're married?

15:08.880 --> 15:09.720
Engaged.

15:14.400 --> 15:15.240
Kids?

15:16.120 --> 15:17.200
I have three.

15:21.280 --> 15:22.480
That's why I'm here.

15:23.880 --> 15:26.800
I need you to stay away
from my family, Ray.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.000
How did you find me?

15:36.600 --> 15:37.600
Luck.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.680
Coincidence.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.400
Poisoned fucking fate, I guess.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.680
I thought you were dead.

15:51.680 --> 15:52.520
I'm sorry.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.080
People kept telling me
that you'd run away with Stewart Green,

15:57.160 --> 15:58.800
but that just didn't make sense.

15:59.320 --> 16:03.160
You just… disappeared, like…

16:04.240 --> 16:07.200
like you and me never even existed.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.360
-I know you're upset--
-Upset?

16:14.720 --> 16:15.760
Why are we here?

16:15.840 --> 16:20.520
-I need you to stay away from my family.
-Yeah, but why here?

16:24.240 --> 16:27.640
You kept the key all these years.

16:29.160 --> 16:30.200
Open.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.440
Wow.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.840
I told you to dress up.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.320
What? This is my favorite jacket.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.960
Come here.

17:01.160 --> 17:02.720
I looked for your photos.

17:04.240 --> 17:09.280
Oh, uh, I… tried to carry on
like everything was normal,

17:09.360 --> 17:13.800
but… after a while,
I just couldn't do it anymore.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.480
What about you?
What was your "after" like?

17:20.560 --> 17:21.560
Scary.

17:23.720 --> 17:24.560
Lonely.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.640
I had to leave.
That didn't mean I wanted to.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.200
Why are we here?

17:34.440 --> 17:35.560
Cassie?

17:36.720 --> 17:37.800
It's Megan now.

17:59.880 --> 18:02.120
-I shouldn't be here.
-Don't go.

18:09.880 --> 18:10.800
Kayleigh!

18:11.320 --> 18:12.160
Kayleigh!

18:15.720 --> 18:16.560
Kay, wait!

18:17.080 --> 18:18.080
Kay, wait!

18:18.920 --> 18:21.800
-Kayleigh, please stop! Hey!
-Who's that random guy?

18:21.880 --> 18:23.280
You're cheating on Dad.

18:23.880 --> 18:27.640
I followed you to Vipers a few weeks ago.
I know you've been lying to everyone.

18:27.720 --> 18:30.080
Listen, I don't know what you…
what you think is going on,

18:30.160 --> 18:31.800
but this is… this is ridiculous.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.560
-I'm calling Dad.
-Kayleigh, wait.

18:33.640 --> 18:35.280
-Stop.
-<i> This is Dave.</i>

18:35.360 --> 18:37.080
<i>-Leave a message.</i>
-I'll tell you everything!

18:39.800 --> 18:41.800
-Who is he?
-He's an old friend.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.080
Yeah, I got that.

18:43.160 --> 18:47.240
Years ago, before I met your dad,
I used to work at that club, Vipers.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.080
I was a dancer.

18:50.320 --> 18:53.560
When I went to that charity conference,
the hotel was close by,

18:53.640 --> 18:56.880
and I just thought
I would go back and… and see my old life.

18:56.960 --> 19:00.120
-But you lied about today as well.
-I didn't lie.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.760
-Did you used to fuck?
-Kayleigh!

19:03.440 --> 19:05.440
I don't know
who you think you're talking to.

19:05.960 --> 19:06.800
No.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.320
No, we… we were just friends.

19:11.360 --> 19:15.280
Look, he… he used to work on the door.
He… he used to look out for me.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.080
He wanted to see how I was getting on.

19:20.040 --> 19:23.680
Please, you and your dad
and… Laura and Jordan,

19:23.760 --> 19:24.960
you are the world to me.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.240
You are everything.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.400
And that guy?

19:29.040 --> 19:31.200
I told you. He was just an old friend.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.160
I'm still telling Dad.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.000
Okay, of course.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.160
I've got nothing to hide.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.080
I'm going to the church now.
I'll tell him.

19:44.720 --> 19:45.800
I'll be at Bea's.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.560
Fuck.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.240
Okay, thanks.

19:51.320 --> 19:54.240
Told you. Leanne says
the missing men check out.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.960
Every disappearance happened on Carnival.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.440
The cycle means
it took 17 years to repeat the dates,

19:59.520 --> 20:03.280
which is why Stewart and Carlton
both disappeared on April the 16th

20:03.360 --> 20:04.640
exactly 17 years apart.

20:04.720 --> 20:05.560
Great.

20:06.640 --> 20:10.840
So it says in here Zain Kaleed was stabbed
three times in the neck and heart.

20:10.920 --> 20:13.320
Jamal Alade was the only suspect.

20:13.400 --> 20:17.120
Murder weapon and blood-covered T-shirt
found in Jamal's garage.

20:17.640 --> 20:22.000
Clear motive. Jamal and Zain were
sexual rivals with a history of violence.

20:22.080 --> 20:24.800
They had his name in hours,
case sorted in days.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.080
Didn't have an alibi.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.880
And even his phone
was in the area at the time.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.120
-
-Jury was only out an hour.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.800
Um… I just need to, uh…

20:39.000 --> 20:40.400
So what do you think?

20:40.480 --> 20:42.640
<i>I know we said</i>
<i>we wanted to try something fun,</i>

20:42.720 --> 20:44.520
but are you sure this is what you want?

20:44.600 --> 20:48.360
It was you who suggested it last night,
Miss Seize-the-Day, Live-for-the-Moment.

20:49.520 --> 20:53.520
Look, I've got to go,
but, uh… send me a pic.

20:53.600 --> 20:57.000
Okay. If this is what you like, I'm game.

21:04.520 --> 21:05.880
-Sir.

21:21.360 --> 21:22.400
What do you want?

21:23.480 --> 21:25.760
We just wanted to ask you
a few questions about--

21:25.840 --> 21:27.800
Which one of your boys set me up.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.960
Well, a jury found you guilty.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.240
A <i>white </i>jury.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.280
The prosecution presented
sufficient evidence

21:36.360 --> 21:37.760
that you killed Zain Kaleed.

21:37.840 --> 21:42.360
And my doctor used to say
sickle cell wouldn't kill me.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.920
Turns out people lie.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.440
I'm sorry to hear that.
How often do you go to the hospital?

21:49.080 --> 21:52.680
Dialysis three, four times a week.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.160
Only in here 'cause of a chest infection.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.760
Were you at the hospital six days ago?

21:58.840 --> 22:03.240
See, those are the sort of questions

22:03.320 --> 22:08.280
that make me feel like
we shouldn't be havin' this conversation.

22:08.360 --> 22:11.200
We just wanted
a bit of help with our inquiries.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.040
Do you know this man?

22:23.560 --> 22:24.840
You ever been to Vipers?

22:26.080 --> 22:29.720
Wardens aren't exactly big on nights out.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.040
Tell us about Zain Kaleed.

22:40.200 --> 22:43.200
He assaulted your girlfriend,
Stacey Zobeck,

22:44.360 --> 22:45.840
which led to a fight.

22:45.920 --> 22:48.280
A knife was pulled during the Carnival.

22:49.800 --> 22:52.400
You were hurt, and you killed him
two days later in revenge.

22:52.480 --> 22:55.360
Like I told you, lies.

22:55.440 --> 22:56.280
Lies.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.360
You're saying there wasn't a fight?
There were witnesses.

23:03.440 --> 23:04.760
To a bit of beef.

23:05.320 --> 23:06.640
Not to me killing him.

23:08.560 --> 23:12.480
What, I'm smart enough to stab the brotha

23:13.280 --> 23:14.400
with no one seeing

23:15.720 --> 23:20.160
but not enough
to hide the knife I used to do it?

23:23.800 --> 23:27.080
-Makes no sense.
-There was also a T-shirt.

23:27.160 --> 23:30.560
That had the same blood on it
as the knife.

23:32.360 --> 23:33.200
I kill a man,

23:34.240 --> 23:36.680
soaked in his blood,

23:37.400 --> 23:40.440
but my trousers, not a spot?

23:41.960 --> 23:43.640
Was I wearin' magical denim?

23:45.200 --> 23:49.640
Levi's so good
they repel all signs of murder.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.360
Listen to me.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.360
I was set up

23:56.640 --> 23:57.880
by you lot.

24:00.240 --> 24:03.280
I appreciate the force
hasn't always been perfect--

24:17.280 --> 24:18.640
I wasn't perfect,

24:20.320 --> 24:23.440
but that doesn't make me a killer.

24:27.200 --> 24:30.560
They say that only He can judge me,
but you lot judged me.

24:33.320 --> 24:34.160
You lot

24:35.520 --> 24:36.520
put me here.

24:38.480 --> 24:42.400
They gave me 25 for somethin' I didn't do.

24:42.960 --> 24:45.640
And the only time I've been out

24:46.480 --> 24:48.520
is to sit in a hospital room

24:48.600 --> 24:53.760
and listen to people tell me
how quickly I'm going to die.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.240
So unless your inquiries

24:56.320 --> 24:58.880
are about finding
the fucker who did this to me…

25:01.160 --> 25:02.080
we're done.

25:04.440 --> 25:06.640
Wonder how much security
he gets in hospital.

25:06.720 --> 25:08.480
A lot, last time I checked.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.520
I doubt he'd fake all of that

25:10.600 --> 25:13.160
just so he could jump out
of a hospital window in the dead of night

25:13.240 --> 25:15.120
and kill two people three miles away.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.600
Someone might have noticed.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.680
Well, maybe he's talking
to someone when he's there.

25:18.760 --> 25:21.080
-People move back and forth all the time.
-Mmm.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.840
Or maybe he's telling the truth.

25:24.880 --> 25:28.400
Like he said, his case
did seem a little bit too tidy, didn't it?

25:28.920 --> 25:31.080
With a temper like his,
he'd have been easy to pin it on.

25:31.160 --> 25:34.280
-Mmm. Let me see the file again.
-Could the killer have framed him?

25:38.160 --> 25:39.680
You're right about his temper.

25:40.400 --> 25:41.800
Says here, before all this,

25:41.880 --> 25:45.400
he got cautioned after a row
with another girlfriend turned nasty.

25:48.440 --> 25:50.840
Zain Kaleed and Stewart Green
both hit women.

25:51.360 --> 25:53.960
-Even Tawny Allure--
-I still love that name.

25:54.040 --> 25:57.120
She said that Carlton
could be violent. Now Jamal.

25:58.720 --> 26:02.160
Right, so we're looking
at men who beat women,

26:02.760 --> 26:06.200
linked to numerous disappearances,
possibly two murders,

26:06.280 --> 26:10.800
and someone who's locked away for killing
someone, even though maybe they didn't.

26:12.640 --> 26:13.720
Which means?

26:15.440 --> 26:16.840
-I've no idea.
-Mmm.

26:16.920 --> 26:18.480
-Oh, here.

26:24.800 --> 26:25.840
Oh!

26:32.800 --> 26:36.800
Hi, uh, there's been some sort of mix-up.
They've sent you the wrong outfit.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.240
Oh, thank God for that.

26:38.320 --> 26:42.960
I know you shouldn't judge a man's kinks,
but I was getting a bit worried!

26:43.040 --> 26:44.480
I bet you were.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.680
-I'll be over when we're done, okay?
-<i> Okay.</i>

26:49.080 --> 26:50.000
Okay, come on.

26:51.080 --> 26:52.760
What is going on with you two?

26:53.720 --> 26:55.560
You're behaving
like some excited little kitten.

26:55.640 --> 26:58.680
-Frankly, it's unnerving.
-Nothing. We're just having a bit of fun.

27:00.320 --> 27:02.160
Nah. I've seen you have fun.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.720
This is not that.

27:04.800 --> 27:08.280
What do you want me to say?
She's fearless. She's sexy.

27:08.360 --> 27:11.480
Every time she walks in, I'm incapable
of holding a thought in my head,

27:11.560 --> 27:13.360
and all I want to do is make her smile.

27:14.240 --> 27:15.400
Is that what you wanna hear?

27:17.600 --> 27:18.520
Wow.

27:22.080 --> 27:22.920
Hello.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.000
Okay. Yeah. We'll be right there.

27:34.440 --> 27:37.840
We look at the building blocks
that define our partnerships,

27:37.920 --> 27:41.400
whether you've been together for years
or a few months.

27:42.040 --> 27:44.560
Memories are meant
to be real, aren't they?

27:44.640 --> 27:47.400
A faithful recreation
of something that really happened.

27:48.000 --> 27:48.840
No.

27:49.720 --> 27:51.640
We only remember pieces,

27:51.720 --> 27:54.160
forget the stuff that doesn't make sense.

27:55.200 --> 27:59.920
Our memories are as subjective
and messed with as any other story.

28:00.560 --> 28:03.280
And the stories
that we tell about our relationships

28:03.800 --> 28:06.800
can help us understand
how we really see each other.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.880
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:10.240 --> 28:12.280
I want you to all close your eyes.

28:12.800 --> 28:16.400
Now, it's never too early or too late

28:16.480 --> 28:20.240
to interrogate who we are
as a couple or your partner.

28:27.320 --> 28:28.400
Okay, thank you.

28:36.520 --> 28:37.600
What was that about?

28:38.760 --> 28:41.160
I was thinkin'
about introducin' him to Kayleigh.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.960
He'll get to meet her
at the wedding rehearsal.

28:44.480 --> 28:47.400
I thought he could come to the house,
talk some sense into her.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.600
You're joking, right?

28:49.680 --> 28:52.560
-I should text her.
-Yeah, but she doesn't have her phone.

28:52.640 --> 28:55.560
Oh, please. We both know
she took it the second I left the house.

28:55.640 --> 29:00.360
Dave, listen, we don't need
a reverend or a pastor

29:00.440 --> 29:02.320
telling us how to raise our family.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.160
We're good people

29:05.160 --> 29:06.480
who love our children.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.120
And there's nothing we wouldn't do
to protect them.

29:12.560 --> 29:15.520
So I… I… I want you
to have a good time at this stag do.

29:16.840 --> 29:20.440
Just promise me
you won't speak to her till you're back.

29:21.240 --> 29:22.480
Leave her to me.

29:23.640 --> 29:24.600
Okay?

29:25.200 --> 29:26.280
Okay.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.200
Why were you late?

29:31.040 --> 29:33.040
Just work. I couldn't get away.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.640
All right, I'm off.

29:39.720 --> 29:41.560
-Go on, have a good time.

29:41.640 --> 29:43.400
-Love ya.
-Love you.

30:24.440 --> 30:25.920
Come on.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.160
<i> This is Harry Sutton.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

30:29.880 --> 30:30.720
Harry.

30:32.120 --> 30:33.040
Are you okay?

30:34.960 --> 30:36.080
I…

30:37.920 --> 30:39.200
I've just seen Ray.

30:42.680 --> 30:46.760
<i>I need you. Please call me.</i>
<i>It's getting out of hand.</i>

30:47.320 --> 30:50.280
<i>I'm really worried about you.</i>
<i>Can you just call me?</i>

30:54.080 --> 30:56.040
It's the third time
we've been here this year.

30:58.840 --> 31:00.480
The girls at Vipers
are always around here.

31:01.440 --> 31:05.320
Guessing one of them
dropped by for a sesh and called it in.

31:11.320 --> 31:13.560
You see that with overdoses sometimes.

31:13.640 --> 31:16.000
Vomit so hard they burst their eyeballs.

31:18.800 --> 31:22.040
Except there is no vomit,
and it's only one eye.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.080
And an unexplained mark to his neck.

31:24.600 --> 31:27.080
So this is officially
a murder investigation.

31:27.160 --> 31:29.440
Usual rules apply.
Can you call it in for us?

31:32.320 --> 31:33.160
Sierra 4-5…

31:33.240 --> 31:34.760
Is it weird that this happens

31:34.840 --> 31:37.360
just a few days
after this mystery woman Megan

31:37.440 --> 31:38.920
turns up out of nowhere?

31:41.680 --> 31:42.960
Do you really trust her?

32:17.280 --> 32:19.160
Why do the police think you killed Guy?

32:20.960 --> 32:23.040
-They keep interviewing you.

32:24.160 --> 32:28.000
But no one's telling me anything.
I know how it works.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.000
Shit goes down, and boys band together.

32:32.560 --> 32:34.440
You're acting crazy.
You need to calm down.

32:34.520 --> 32:37.240
You know what fucks angry women off
more than anything?

32:37.960 --> 32:39.080
Being told to calm down.

32:39.160 --> 32:41.040
Kind of seems appropriate, considering.

32:41.560 --> 32:45.080
Stop fucking lying to me!
What happened?

32:45.160 --> 32:48.480
He was with a woman. That's…
that's what they're not telling you.

32:52.560 --> 32:58.320
-He was cheating on me?
-He was drunk and… just being an idiot.

33:01.400 --> 33:04.320
It doesn't mean that he didn't love you.

33:21.680 --> 33:23.160
-Here, come here.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.680
-All right, all right.

33:25.760 --> 33:26.800
Come on.

33:30.720 --> 33:31.960
-All right. Come on.

33:36.360 --> 33:37.360
Give me that.

33:38.280 --> 33:39.160
Really?

33:41.520 --> 33:43.920
All right, not my place to judge. Here.

33:54.320 --> 33:58.800
Nice. And not even close to being
the strangest thing I've seen today.

33:59.800 --> 34:02.680
Like you're not going through
your own personal breakdown.

34:03.720 --> 34:06.840
This is seriously weird. Who is she?

34:09.160 --> 34:12.520
She… was everything.

34:15.520 --> 34:19.200
I've spent… 17 years of my life…

34:21.200 --> 34:22.560
dreaming about her.

34:24.640 --> 34:28.640
And today, she just… walked away
like I was nothing.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.480
And now,

34:33.440 --> 34:35.960
I'm not even sure
any of it was real back then.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.560
Maybe it was just me all along.

34:46.080 --> 34:47.080
Mmm.

34:47.880 --> 34:48.800
She's hot.

34:50.040 --> 34:52.760
Generally speaking,
hot women can't be trusted.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.000
Except for you,

34:56.040 --> 34:57.240
Sergeant.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.280
Especially me.

35:00.880 --> 35:02.240
All I can think is that

35:03.560 --> 35:06.680
some fucker has taken Guy away from us.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.840
And he's never coming back.

36:51.720 --> 36:52.880
You can't be here.

36:54.800 --> 36:55.720
It's Harry.

37:07.360 --> 37:08.920
This can't be happening.

37:12.920 --> 37:16.000
It's time we talked all this through
properly down at the station.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.360
All cards on the table.

37:20.200 --> 37:23.200
You tell us everything you know
about Stewart, everything else you know,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.720
it might help us
find out who did this to Harry.

37:34.400 --> 37:37.360
So with Harry gone,
we can get you someone else if you need.

37:37.880 --> 37:40.720
I thought this was just a chat.
I'm not under arrest, am I?

37:41.240 --> 37:44.560
Let's just start with a witness statement,
shall we? Take it from there.

38:13.880 --> 38:17.800
According to Goldberg,
this is where Megan Pierce lives.

38:18.480 --> 38:20.680
This place is just so…

38:23.720 --> 38:24.880
domestic.

38:28.360 --> 38:29.520
Say it.

38:32.800 --> 38:33.840
Say it.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.600
Daddy!

38:36.560 --> 38:37.840
No kids.

38:40.520 --> 38:41.560
Or puppies or kittens.

38:41.640 --> 38:44.240
Or rabbits or anything
of the gerbil lineage.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.120
Just us.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.960
None of this family nonsense.

38:52.280 --> 38:53.440
Of course, darling.

38:58.760 --> 38:59.680
We should get going.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.200
Just us.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.080
She said "dancer."

39:12.600 --> 39:14.720
But we know what that really means.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.440
Go easy on her, okay?

39:16.520 --> 39:20.200
No slut-shaming and no asking
if she had sex with clients for money.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.080
-Bea!
-I'm just saying.

39:22.160 --> 39:26.680
Those are the sort of nasty stereotypes
strippers have had to deal with for years.

39:26.760 --> 39:30.360
And it wouldn't have mattered if she did.
Her body, her choice.

39:30.440 --> 39:32.280
-#Supportsexworkers.

39:32.360 --> 39:33.560
I'm gonna be sick.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.160
See you later, Bea.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.200
Mum?

40:20.760 --> 40:22.040
What do you think?

40:23.640 --> 40:25.400
Orange has never really been my color.
