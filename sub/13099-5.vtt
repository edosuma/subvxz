00:10.917 --> 00:12.250
(John)
'What have we got?'

00:12.333 --> 00:13.542
We picked up a weak signal
a short time ago

00:13.625 --> 00:15.250
coming out of deep space.

00:15.333 --> 00:16.833
Not using the jumpgate?

00:16.917 --> 00:19.208
No, and it's using a frequency
I've never heard before.

00:19.292 --> 00:21.083
Hmm. Alien?

00:21.167 --> 00:22.958
Not exactly.

[both grunting]

00:45.167 --> 00:46.625
Through the walls!

00:46.708 --> 00:48.917
It's coming through the wa..

00:51.125 --> 00:54.750
Oh. I need some ozones.

00:54.833 --> 00:57.375
[heavy breathing]

00:59.708 --> 01:01.042
No ozones.

01:01.125 --> 01:02.458
[choking]

01:02.542 --> 01:04.750
Oh, no!

01:06.417 --> 01:08.000
I'm stuck!

01:09.042 --> 01:11.042
Get out of my head!

01:13.875 --> 01:15.250
Where are you?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.167
There you are.

01:26.083 --> 01:27.667
There you are.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.583
I see you.

01:32.292 --> 01:34.667
Our Father,
who is in heaven

01:34.750 --> 01:36.125
hallowed be the name

01:36.208 --> 01:39.500
thy kingdom is, uh, done.

01:39.583 --> 01:41.333
Thy will is something

01:41.417 --> 01:44.292
on Earth
as it is in-in space.

01:44.375 --> 01:45.667
[groans]

01:45.750 --> 01:47.542

(male narrator)
The Babylon Project was our
last best hope for peace.

02:06.292 --> 02:09.042
A self-contained world
five miles long

02:09.125 --> 02:11.958
located in neutral territory.

02:14.875 --> 02:16.875
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

02:16.958 --> 02:19.708
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

02:20.792 --> 02:23.833
A shining beacon in space

02:23.917 --> 02:26.375
all alone in the night.

02:26.458 --> 02:29.542
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind.

02:29.625 --> 02:33.958
The year the Great War
came upon us all.

02:34.042 --> 02:37.875
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

02:37.958 --> 02:40.167
The year is 2259.

02:40.250 --> 02:41.458
The name of the place

02:41.542 --> 02:44.333
is Babylon 5.

Hear me, oh, Lord,
and the rest of you

03:41.208 --> 03:43.625
miserable sinners
and you non-humanoid types!

03:43.708 --> 03:44.875
Judgment day is coming

03:44.958 --> 03:46.292
and it don't care what you
look like.

03:46.375 --> 03:47.958
And I have seen it.

03:48.042 --> 03:50.792
An army of darkness,
soldiers of the devil

03:50.875 --> 03:52.458
or something like that.

03:52.542 --> 03:54.875
We're all in great danger!

You!

A sound tree

04:00.875 --> 04:01.958
unless it's got bad roots.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.458
Oh, please, don't I have
troubles enough?

04:04.542 --> 04:05.625
I have walked
in the valley of the--

04:05.708 --> 04:07.625
Good! Keep on walking.

Hurry, ambassador, he's gaining.

You with the hair..

04:13.750 --> 04:15.125
Oh, jeez.

04:15.208 --> 04:17.167
Please.

04:17.250 --> 04:20.208
Now, unless you have
a Class C missionary license

04:20.292 --> 04:21.417
it's time for a little R&amp;R.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.833
You can't. You can't!

04:22.917 --> 04:24.458
There is no shelter.
It's coming! It's coming!

04:24.542 --> 04:25.750
Right.

04:31.250 --> 04:33.375
Just got the message.
Any idea where it's from?

04:33.458 --> 04:35.083
We're still trying
to identify the design.

04:35.167 --> 04:37.083
'But wherever it's been,
it's taken a hell of a beating.'

04:37.167 --> 04:38.667
Why didn't it use
the jumpgate?

04:38.750 --> 04:40.625
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

04:42.625 --> 04:44.833
(female #1)
'Maintenance,
hold Bot 12 in position'

04:44.917 --> 04:46.667

(male #1)
'Roger, Control. We're trying
for a visual ID now.'

04:51.333 --> 04:53.250
- Those look like letters.
- 'Mmm.'

04:53.333 --> 04:54.333
It's English.

04:54.417 --> 04:56.042
USS.

04:56.125 --> 04:57.208
Earth?

04:57.292 --> 04:58.708
I've never seen this design
before.

04:58.792 --> 05:01.042
Hmm. Then check your history.

05:01.125 --> 05:04.042
Ships like this were used
in early deep-range exploration

05:04.125 --> 05:06.125
back before we got
jumpgate technology

05:06.208 --> 05:07.792
'from the Centauri.'

05:07.875 --> 05:09.042
Well, that's was over
a hundred years ago.

05:09.125 --> 05:10.542
What's it doing
way out here?

05:10.625 --> 05:12.542
Things were pretty
primitive back then.

05:12.625 --> 05:15.708
Maybe it missed a thruster
firing or went off course.

05:15.792 --> 05:17.500
Wow. It's been adrift
ever since.

05:17.583 --> 05:18.917
Possibly.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.208
That's a hell of a wrong turn
to make.

05:21.292 --> 05:22.875
Maybe it wasn't a wrong turn.

05:24.167 --> 05:26.167
Why don't we ask the pilot?

05:26.250 --> 05:28.833
(John)
There is something
alive in there.

05:28.917 --> 05:30.750
Bring her in.

05:30.833 --> 05:33.167
- Sheridan to Medlab.
- 'Franklin.'

05:33.250 --> 05:37.042
We may have a patient
for you in Docking Bay 4.

[dramatic music]

05:50.500 --> 05:52.583

06:10.458 --> 06:11.583
I got something over here.

06:11.667 --> 06:13.083
Cryogenic freezer.

06:13.167 --> 06:14.958
I've seen them
at the Air and Space Museum.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.292
Well, let's see
if anybody's home.

06:20.792 --> 06:22.792
(Michael)
'Oh. This one's dead.'

06:22.875 --> 06:25.167
I've got life signs
in this one right here.

06:41.208 --> 06:43.000
Her signal's weakening.

06:43.083 --> 06:45.042
Opening the ship must have
triggered something.

06:45.125 --> 06:46.333
(Stephen)
'We're gonna have to get her
back to Medlab'

06:46.417 --> 06:47.458
'or we'll lose her.'

06:47.542 --> 06:49.000
Open it up.

Ready, hit her.

07:25.417 --> 07:27.500
- Nothing.
- Try it again.

07:33.083 --> 07:34.958
Go! Move!

07:36.792 --> 07:38.250
(Amis)
'Incoming!'

07:38.333 --> 07:39.958
'Incoming!'

07:41.500 --> 07:44.542
Incoming! Incoming! In..

07:44.625 --> 07:45.792
How long has
he been like that?

07:45.875 --> 07:47.417
Couple of hours now.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.917
To the walls.
Get to the walls.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.708
Damn lurkers.

07:51.792 --> 07:53.625
We ought to space
all of them.

07:53.708 --> 07:56.042
- Oh, God, stop them.
- Hanson.

07:56.125 --> 07:57.750
Incoming.

08:00.292 --> 08:01.417
Were you in the war?

08:01.500 --> 08:02.542
No, I missed it.

08:02.625 --> 08:04.125
He didn't.

08:04.208 --> 08:05.208
How do you know?

08:05.292 --> 08:08.042
Incoming.

08:08.125 --> 08:09.625
I've had that same dream.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.167
[switch clicks]

08:27.125 --> 08:28.708

08:28.792 --> 08:30.208

08:31.833 --> 08:33.583
[indistinct voice]

08:55.958 --> 08:57.125
[gasps]

08:59.458 --> 09:00.542
You alright?

09:04.083 --> 09:06.333
I never felt better.

09:06.417 --> 09:09.583
I'm a picture of...health.

09:09.667 --> 09:11.208
Where am I?

09:11.292 --> 09:12.875
Oh, God.

09:12.958 --> 09:14.500
[chuckles]

09:14.583 --> 09:16.708
What did I do this time?

09:16.792 --> 09:18.042
You don't remember?

09:18.125 --> 09:19.792
Well, I found that life is

09:19.875 --> 09:21.958
in general, much easier

09:22.042 --> 09:23.583
if I forget

09:23.667 --> 09:26.583
most of the things
that happen to me.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.667
You were about to accuse
the Centauri ambassador

09:28.750 --> 09:30.208
of being in league
with the devil

09:30.292 --> 09:31.792
which might not be
far from the truth.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.667
Oh, God, my head hurts.

09:33.750 --> 09:34.958
They've had to put you out.

09:35.042 --> 09:38.250
Oh, I was that bad.

09:38.333 --> 09:39.708
You were standing
in the middle of the Plaza

09:39.792 --> 09:42.958
yelling that the day
of judgment was coming.

09:43.042 --> 09:44.167
Did it?

09:44.250 --> 09:45.625
Not that I know, but

09:45.708 --> 09:48.042
I may have missed
a staff meeting.

09:48.125 --> 09:49.167
You ever done this before?

09:49.250 --> 09:50.250
[chuckles]

09:50.333 --> 09:52.792
Hell, I-I've done
everything before.

09:52.875 --> 09:54.625
[chuckles]

10:00.083 --> 10:02.292
Where were you stationed?

10:02.375 --> 10:03.333
Nowhere special.

10:03.417 --> 10:06.208
Just here and there.

10:06.292 --> 10:07.167
Just a gropo.

10:07.250 --> 10:09.792
It was no big deal.

10:09.875 --> 10:12.708
I figured you
for a ground pounder.

10:12.792 --> 10:13.958
Me too.

10:16.250 --> 10:19.208
It looks like we both
missed our chance to be heroes.

10:20.917 --> 10:22.292
What about the dreams?

10:24.292 --> 10:27.792
Dreams? Well,
I-I...never dream.

10:27.875 --> 10:29.708
You've been talking
in your sleep.

10:29.792 --> 10:31.958
Is there a reason
that that door is open?

10:34.000 --> 10:35.125
You can go.

10:37.833 --> 10:39.042
I know some good counselors.

10:39.125 --> 10:42.250
I've used them myself.

10:42.333 --> 10:44.792
Now, what would a man

10:44.875 --> 10:48.208
with everything in the world

10:48.292 --> 10:50.292
do with one of them?

10:50.375 --> 10:51.958
Hmm?

11:00.042 --> 11:02.208
[device beeping]

11:11.625 --> 11:12.667
When did it start?

11:12.750 --> 11:14.292
Moments ago.

11:14.375 --> 11:16.458
'Looks like a dream.'

11:16.542 --> 11:17.833
Or a nightmare.

11:17.917 --> 11:19.000
[gasps]

11:19.083 --> 11:20.708
(Stephen)
It's alright.

11:20.792 --> 11:22.708
I'm a doctor.

11:22.792 --> 11:24.167
Do you understand?

11:25.917 --> 11:28.292
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

11:28.375 --> 11:29.792
I'll take care of you.

11:34.583 --> 11:35.917
I ran a general diagnostic

11:36.000 --> 11:39.125
of all systems that still
appear to be operating.

11:39.208 --> 11:40.875
And then I found this.

11:40.958 --> 11:42.500
'According
to the system analysis'

11:42.583 --> 11:45.458
'there's no malfunction
of the other cryogenic tube.'

11:45.542 --> 11:47.167
He should be alive.

11:47.250 --> 11:48.292
You double checked it?

11:48.375 --> 11:49.917
Three times.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.875
Something or someone
murdered him.

11:58.333 --> 11:59.750
(Stephen)
'At the time of death,
the victim's weight'

11:59.833 --> 12:02.292
appears to be have
been about 90 pounds.

12:02.375 --> 12:03.792
Given his height
and bone structure

12:03.875 --> 12:06.625
his normal weight
should have been 180.

12:06.708 --> 12:10.208
But malnutrition
wasn't what killed him.

12:10.292 --> 12:14.292
'He died as a result
of organ failure.'

12:14.375 --> 12:16.792
- Why?
- I don't know.

12:16.875 --> 12:18.292
They're missing.

12:18.375 --> 12:19.958
It's as if something
reached inside of him

12:20.042 --> 12:22.125
and pulled everything out.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.833
- What happened to the organs?
- Hmm?

12:23.917 --> 12:26.292
There's no evidence of them
anywhere on the ship.

12:26.375 --> 12:27.792
We ran a complete scan.

12:27.875 --> 12:29.125
'If there was so much
as a cell remaining'

12:29.208 --> 12:31.500
'we would have found it.'

12:31.583 --> 12:32.708
I think we better have a talk

12:32.792 --> 12:34.458
with the woman
who was with him.

12:34.542 --> 12:36.667
No, I don't think
that's such a good idea yet.

12:36.750 --> 12:37.833
A man's been murdered

12:37.917 --> 12:39.708
and the list of suspects
is pretty short.

12:39.792 --> 12:41.000
According to the ship's log

12:41.083 --> 12:43.500
she was in stasis
the whole time.

12:43.583 --> 12:44.708
She couldn't have done it.

12:44.792 --> 12:46.208
Logs can be altered.

12:46.292 --> 12:47.833
And it's a good bet
he didn't reach down his throat

12:47.917 --> 12:49.500
and yank out his own heart.

12:49.583 --> 12:50.667
(med tech)
'Dr. Franklin?'

12:50.750 --> 12:51.750
Yes?

12:51.833 --> 12:53.542
'She's awake
and asking for you.'

12:54.917 --> 12:56.083
I have to go.

12:56.167 --> 12:58.167
When she's ready,
I wanna talk to her.

12:58.250 --> 12:59.625
Finish up for me.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.333
- Lousy way to die, huh?
- Mmm.

13:06.417 --> 13:09.042
Last I checked, there weren't
too many good ways.

13:19.125 --> 13:20.292
Well.

13:20.375 --> 13:21.625
Looking a lot better.

13:21.708 --> 13:24.208
Oh, I'm feeling
a lot better

13:24.292 --> 13:26.708
thanks to you, Doctor..

13:26.792 --> 13:28.917
Franklin.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.250
Stephen.

13:31.708 --> 13:34.542
If you don't mind
answering a few questions?

13:34.625 --> 13:36.875
What were you doing
on that ship?

13:36.958 --> 13:39.042
Will, my husband and I

13:39.125 --> 13:41.708
are part of a commercial
research group.

13:41.792 --> 13:43.833
They needed volunteers
for a long-term

13:43.917 --> 13:47.125
deep-space mission
and I jumped at the chance.

13:47.208 --> 13:49.667
We were assigned
to the Copernicus.

13:49.750 --> 13:52.500
She was programmed
to home in on any signal

13:52.583 --> 13:56.250
we might come across
and wake us up.

13:56.333 --> 13:59.958
I never thought the signal
could be of human origin.

14:00.042 --> 14:02.333
How long were we in stasis?

14:03.667 --> 14:06.250
I think we should take
this a day at a time.

14:08.208 --> 14:10.583
That doesn't sound very good.

14:10.667 --> 14:12.917
How long?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.833
Well, I don't have
the exact number..

14:15.917 --> 14:18.292
...but over 100 years.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.167
A hundred..

14:25.667 --> 14:27.250
I'd like to see Will now.

14:29.750 --> 14:31.333
'Something's wrong, isn't it?'

14:33.792 --> 14:35.750
I'm afraid he died
during the voyage.

14:35.833 --> 14:36.958
'I'm sorry.'

14:37.042 --> 14:39.125
Oh, God.

14:39.208 --> 14:40.583
We still haven't been
able to determine

14:40.667 --> 14:42.417
exactly what happened.

14:43.917 --> 14:46.167
We just said goodnight
to each other.

14:49.125 --> 14:50.292
I can't cry.

14:50.375 --> 14:53.500
Long-term stasis
dries the tear ducts.

14:53.583 --> 14:55.167
God.

14:55.250 --> 14:57.083
What have I done?

15:01.958 --> 15:03.417
It says
that the system's down.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.125
You gotta check
the reading.

15:05.208 --> 15:08.625
- I'm trying.
- 'What? See what it says?'

15:09.583 --> 15:11.708
[instrumental music]

15:17.375 --> 15:19.375
Holy mother.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.500
(male #1)
'Hey, you!'

15:33.125 --> 15:34.833
[dramatic music]

15:39.083 --> 15:41.917
Never seen an alien
before, have you?

15:42.000 --> 15:44.500
There are indications
of their other life forms

15:44.583 --> 15:47.833
but I never imagined
anything like that.

15:47.917 --> 15:49.583
I've missed so much.

15:49.667 --> 15:52.500
Well, not all
of it's been good.

15:54.458 --> 15:56.208
A few years after
your ship left Earth

15:56.292 --> 15:58.875
we finally made contact
with another species.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.458
The Centauri.

16:00.542 --> 16:01.708
We opened up trade relations

16:01.792 --> 16:04.167
and they gave us
jumpgate technology.

16:04.250 --> 16:05.500
But before that,
we'd been pretty much

16:05.583 --> 16:07.917
limited to our own solar system.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.333
And after that

16:09.417 --> 16:11.625
we were out among the stars.

16:11.708 --> 16:13.708
First, leasing time
on alien jumpgates

16:13.792 --> 16:15.333
and then building our own.

16:16.417 --> 16:19.167
So the cryogenic suspension

16:19.250 --> 16:21.000
the goodbyes..

16:22.250 --> 16:24.625
...was all for nothing.

16:24.708 --> 16:29.500
If we'd just waited
a few more years.

16:29.583 --> 16:31.958
Well, you couldn't have known.

16:32.042 --> 16:35.000
What you did, it-it took..

16:35.083 --> 16:36.833
...vision.
It took courage.

16:38.625 --> 16:40.583
What else have I missed?

16:40.667 --> 16:42.500
Uh, the usual.

16:42.583 --> 16:44.208
The good times
and the bad times.

16:44.292 --> 16:46.792
The revelations,
the revolutions.

16:46.875 --> 16:49.417
Outbreaks of hysteria,
the parade of scandals

16:49.500 --> 16:51.375
promises, constitutions

16:51.458 --> 16:53.208
and the occasional war.

16:53.292 --> 16:55.917
The last big ones were
against the Dilgar, which we won

16:56.000 --> 16:58.375
and against the Minbari,
which..

16:58.458 --> 17:01.083
Well, that's a long story.

17:01.167 --> 17:04.667
Then we still haven't
outgrown violence?

17:04.750 --> 17:06.083
No.

17:06.167 --> 17:07.583
It's gonna take a lot more
than a 100 years

17:07.667 --> 17:09.000
to evolve a better human.

17:09.083 --> 17:11.917
- 'Doctor.'
- Ambassador.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.583
This must be our visitor
from the past.

17:14.667 --> 17:18.167
Mariah Cirrus, this is
Ambassador G'kar of the Narn.

17:24.292 --> 17:25.792
(G'kar)
'Take my advice and go back'

17:25.875 --> 17:27.542
to the time you came from.

17:27.625 --> 17:30.208
The future isn't
what it used to be.

17:40.167 --> 17:42.292
[screaming]

17:49.792 --> 17:51.250
(Stephen)
'Welcome back.'

17:53.542 --> 17:55.917
Here, take it easy.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.500
You passed out.

17:58.583 --> 17:59.958
Where am I?

18:00.042 --> 18:01.292
My quarters.

18:01.375 --> 18:03.208
They were closer than Medlab.

18:03.292 --> 18:05.125
Mmm.

18:05.208 --> 18:07.958
I guess you came
to my rescue again.

18:08.042 --> 18:10.333
Hardly.

18:10.417 --> 18:12.833
You were having a dream.

18:12.917 --> 18:17.208
You cried out as if
something were attacking you.

18:17.292 --> 18:18.375
I did?

18:18.458 --> 18:20.333
Yeah.

18:20.417 --> 18:21.542
[exhales sharply]

18:21.625 --> 18:23.625
I guess
I just don't remember.

18:23.708 --> 18:26.000
It seemed very frightening
and violent.

18:28.250 --> 18:30.333
Why are you interested
in my dreams?

18:31.958 --> 18:35.458
I haven't been completely candid
with you about your husband.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.333
What are you saying?

18:38.417 --> 18:39.833
He didn't just die.

18:39.917 --> 18:43.167
Something killed him.
Something that was on that ship.

18:43.250 --> 18:44.333
No, there were..

18:44.417 --> 18:47.542
...there were just
the...two of us.

18:49.458 --> 18:51.083
God.

18:51.167 --> 18:52.333
You think I killed him.

18:52.417 --> 18:53.542
No, no, no, no.

18:53.625 --> 18:54.958
I think maybe something
in your dreams

18:55.042 --> 18:56.125
might be able to tell us
what did.

18:56.208 --> 18:58.583
No. What kind
of insanity is this?

18:58.667 --> 18:59.708
- It's gonna be alright.
- Oh!

18:59.792 --> 19:00.958
It's gonna be alright.

19:01.042 --> 19:02.708
I don't know where I am
any more. I..

19:02.792 --> 19:05.333
- I'm all alone.
- No, you're not alone.

19:05.417 --> 19:07.042
You're not alone.

19:10.833 --> 19:12.167
You're not.

19:17.417 --> 19:20.375
[instrumental music]

19:26.292 --> 19:28.125
I, uh, I don't think
this is appropriate

19:28.208 --> 19:29.792
at this particular time.

19:31.625 --> 19:33.333
No, I..

19:33.417 --> 19:34.792
...I guess not.

19:36.167 --> 19:38.917
It's just that
I'm a little scared.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.667
I don't know, maybe more
than just a little.

19:42.750 --> 19:44.375
Why don't you, uh..

19:44.458 --> 19:46.542
Why don't you just
try and rest?

19:50.833 --> 19:52.458
'Just try and rest.'

20:02.167 --> 20:03.958
[hisses]

20:08.708 --> 20:10.917
[hisses]

20:13.833 --> 20:15.708
No. No thanks.

20:15.792 --> 20:17.458
I'm trying to cut down.

20:17.542 --> 20:19.792
You are all gonna die!

20:19.875 --> 20:22.917
A soldier of darkness has come
on that ship from the past.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.458
- 'I have seen it.'
- Save me some dessert.

20:24.542 --> 20:27.667
Don't close your eyes,
don't sleep. It'll find you.

20:27.750 --> 20:29.292
Brother Garibaldi,
I was looking for you--

20:29.375 --> 20:31.417
Let's take a walk, huh?

20:31.500 --> 20:32.917
You're starting to make
the Natives restless.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.208
I'm not crazy.
It's on this station.

20:35.292 --> 20:36.292
What is?

20:36.375 --> 20:37.583
Death.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.792
It came off that ship
from the past.

20:39.875 --> 20:41.500
I followed it.

20:41.583 --> 20:42.875
- You sure of that?
- Yes.

20:42.958 --> 20:45.458
I saw it do the same thing
during the war.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.625
[dramatic music]

20:56.417 --> 20:59.042
[growling]

21:02.417 --> 21:04.000
[screaming]

21:08.625 --> 21:10.167
(Stephen)
Finished examining the victim.

21:10.250 --> 21:11.333
Not one of his internal organs

21:11.417 --> 21:13.667
is still inside his body.

21:13.750 --> 21:14.833
What happened to them?

21:14.917 --> 21:16.167
I don't know.

21:16.250 --> 21:18.625
There's no sign of an entry
or exit wound.

21:18.708 --> 21:21.375
In other words, he died the same
way as Mariah's husband.

21:21.458 --> 21:22.708
Correct.

21:22.792 --> 21:25.500
It's assuming
that's who she really is.

21:25.583 --> 21:27.125
What are you saying?

21:27.208 --> 21:29.208
[sighs]
I arrested a lurker
named Amis

21:29.292 --> 21:31.083
who was stationed
on a deep space listening post

21:31.167 --> 21:32.292
during the war.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.208
Forty-seven men
landed on that moon.

21:34.292 --> 21:36.375
All of them were slaughtered
except one.

21:38.042 --> 21:39.208
Is there a point to this?

21:39.292 --> 21:40.917
Amis thinks whoever
wiped out his post

21:41.000 --> 21:42.250
came here on the Copernicus.

21:42.333 --> 21:44.208
No. We ran a thorough scan
on that ship.

21:44.292 --> 21:45.292
If there was an alien onboard

21:45.375 --> 21:46.625
we would have found it.

21:46.708 --> 21:48.167
Unless it's something
we'd never seen before.

21:48.250 --> 21:50.833
Something completely
outside our experience.

21:50.917 --> 21:52.417
I traced the ship's path.

21:52.500 --> 21:53.917
It passed within
the gravitational pull

21:54.000 --> 21:56.458
of the same moon
that Amis was stationed on.

21:56.542 --> 21:59.083
'Mariah Cirrus
may not be what she appears.'

21:59.167 --> 22:01.042
She had nothing to do
with his death.

22:01.125 --> 22:02.375
How can you be sure?

22:02.458 --> 22:04.042
Because she was with me
last night.

22:04.125 --> 22:05.292
The whole night.

22:05.375 --> 22:07.292
Oh. Moving kinda fast,
aren't you, doc?

22:07.375 --> 22:09.375
I don't sleep
with my patients.

22:09.458 --> 22:11.375
She's in pain
and I'm helping her. That's all.

22:11.458 --> 22:13.958
I want a watch put on her
24 hours a day

22:14.042 --> 22:15.333
and I don't mean you.

22:15.417 --> 22:17.042
Are you suggesting
I'm not doing my job?

22:17.125 --> 22:19.292
I'm suggesting if something
is threatening this station

22:19.375 --> 22:22.833
I'll do whatever is necessary
to protect it.

22:22.917 --> 22:24.917
All this on the word
of a lurker?

22:25.000 --> 22:26.500
I checked his war record.

22:26.583 --> 22:28.625
They put enough ribbons on his
chest to open a gift shop.

22:28.708 --> 22:31.208
Word of this murder has spread
among the alien community.

22:31.292 --> 22:33.542
The Non-Aligned Worlds have
asked for a council meeting

22:33.625 --> 22:34.917
to discuss the possibility

22:35.000 --> 22:36.542
that something
came aboard this station

22:36.625 --> 22:38.417
from that ship.

22:38.500 --> 22:39.875
Go over her bioscan again

22:39.958 --> 22:42.125
and then make sure
you haven't missed something.

22:55.167 --> 22:56.708
For what it's worth

22:56.792 --> 22:59.042
I hope you're right.

22:59.125 --> 23:00.958
But if you're not

23:01.042 --> 23:02.417
be careful.

23:11.375 --> 23:14.792
We insist this woman be removed
from this station.

23:14.875 --> 23:17.083
On what grounds?

23:17.167 --> 23:20.250
She has brought something evil
from the past.

23:21.042 --> 23:22.833
A soldier of darkness.

23:22.917 --> 23:24.792
[laughs]

23:24.875 --> 23:26.083
That is rich.

23:26.167 --> 23:28.458
Nothing like a good
ghost story, huh?

23:28.542 --> 23:31.792
Let him speak.
I find this very interesting.

23:31.875 --> 23:33.500
Go on.

23:33.583 --> 23:37.458
The forces of darkness
do not move openly.

23:37.542 --> 23:41.833
They work through others,
use others.

23:41.917 --> 23:45.292
When the darkness
was defeated long ago

23:45.375 --> 23:46.667
they scattered..

23:46.750 --> 23:49.167
...hid themselves away
in secret places

23:49.250 --> 23:50.917
and waited.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.458
Now the dark hand
is reaching out

23:53.542 --> 23:55.708
and recalling them
from their sleep.

23:55.792 --> 24:00.250
And you think this woman is one
of these soldiers of darkness?

24:00.333 --> 24:04.542
Evil sometimes
wears a pleasant face.

24:04.625 --> 24:06.167
All too true.

24:06.250 --> 24:09.583
I believe we should consider
what he is saying.

24:09.667 --> 24:11.792
Why am I not surprised?

24:11.875 --> 24:13.417
More of your superstition.

24:13.500 --> 24:14.917
- 'I don't know.'
- Please.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.333
Don't tell me
you believe this?

24:17.417 --> 24:19.333
There's an old human saying.

24:19.417 --> 24:21.958
"Where's there's smoke,
there's fire."

24:22.042 --> 24:24.875
'If you ignore it,
you get burned.'

24:24.958 --> 24:27.208
Now I don't have to believe
in this dark force

24:27.292 --> 24:30.208
to realize there is
something strange going on.

24:30.292 --> 24:32.708
Well, it's been nice having
this little chat with you

24:32.792 --> 24:35.500
but I have more
important things to do.

24:35.583 --> 24:37.875
If there's something
aboard this station

24:37.958 --> 24:40.667
find it and kill it.

24:40.750 --> 24:42.458
It's that simple.

24:42.542 --> 24:45.417
The rest is nonsense.

24:45.500 --> 24:46.917
[chuckling]

24:51.667 --> 24:55.042
If you do nothing about
her presence here..

24:55.125 --> 24:56.542
...we will.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.500
I don't like threats.

25:03.583 --> 25:06.708
And as long as I am
the law on B-5

25:06.792 --> 25:08.792
I intend to see
everyone is protected

25:08.875 --> 25:11.500
human and alien alike.

25:11.583 --> 25:13.083
Understood?

25:16.167 --> 25:17.750
This meeting's adjourned.

25:21.833 --> 25:22.917
Very smooth.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.250
That bad?

25:24.333 --> 25:25.833
What if something did
get onboard the Copernicus

25:25.917 --> 25:27.542
when it passed that moon?

25:27.625 --> 25:29.250
A soldier of darkness?

25:31.500 --> 25:33.417
I'll believe it
when I see it.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.042
Let's hope we don't
get the chance.

25:47.667 --> 25:49.042
[gasps]

25:50.958 --> 25:53.250
[deep breaths]

25:53.333 --> 25:55.542
[exhales sharply]

26:01.292 --> 26:02.667
Oh, hell.

26:05.667 --> 26:09.167
Okay! Rise and shine, pal.

26:09.250 --> 26:12.000
You know, everything in your
Earthforce record suggests

26:12.083 --> 26:13.208
you're out of your mind.

26:13.292 --> 26:14.625
Oh, that's a matter
of some debate

26:14.708 --> 26:15.917
in the medical community.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.125
I mean, there are those
who give me

26:17.208 --> 26:18.417
the benefit of the doubt.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.292
Just figure me
for a compulsive liar.

26:20.375 --> 26:23.083
- You want me to believe you?
- Yeah.

26:23.167 --> 26:24.167
Then this is your chance.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.958
Take me to where
you followed it.

26:27.958 --> 26:29.208
What?

26:29.292 --> 26:30.708
Right now.

26:43.667 --> 26:44.875
It was there.

26:46.958 --> 26:48.000
What did it look like?

26:48.083 --> 26:49.625
The past.

26:52.208 --> 26:53.625
[thudding]

26:56.750 --> 26:58.792
[suspenseful music]

27:13.083 --> 27:15.250
- Freeze!
- Huh!

27:17.750 --> 27:20.833
I-I saw it.
You have to believe me.

27:22.167 --> 27:24.958
You want me, you bastard!

27:25.042 --> 27:26.667
Well, I'm here!

27:26.750 --> 27:28.708
Come on, let's finish it!

27:28.792 --> 27:29.958
Come on!

27:30.042 --> 27:31.542
[sobbing]

27:34.958 --> 27:39.042
During the war,
there was a guy in my unit.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.500
He kept telling everybody
our perimeter was weak.

27:43.625 --> 27:46.667
We laughed 'cause
we checked it over and over.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.000
'It was secure.'

27:51.042 --> 27:53.750
'We all figured
he was nuts.'

27:53.833 --> 27:56.167
Until then,
we'd never seen any action.

28:08.042 --> 28:09.167
Then one night

28:10.333 --> 28:12.583
we stopped laughing.

28:12.667 --> 28:14.958
Came through that perimeter
like it was paper.

28:17.833 --> 28:19.500
He was the first to die.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.208
Saved our butts.

28:25.375 --> 28:27.333
He was a nut..

28:29.292 --> 28:30.667
...but he was right.

28:35.375 --> 28:36.667
I believe you.

28:40.917 --> 28:42.458
The honored did.

28:45.417 --> 28:47.250
Tell me about
the listening post.

28:50.625 --> 28:52.125
We were an intelligence
gathering unit

28:52.208 --> 28:54.708
not set up for heavy combat.

28:54.792 --> 28:56.042
We'd heard the Minbari

28:56.125 --> 28:58.667
were setting up
a command and control post

28:58.750 --> 29:01.500
so we slipped
onto a small moon

29:01.583 --> 29:04.167
before they finished
the perimeter scanners.

29:06.125 --> 29:08.625
They set up camp in..

29:08.708 --> 29:10.208
...old ruins of some kind.

29:10.292 --> 29:12.542
'As far as we knew,
it was a dead world.'

29:16.167 --> 29:17.625
It came in the night

29:18.917 --> 29:21.292
during a storm.

29:21.375 --> 29:23.042
We heard nothing,
saw nothing.

29:25.542 --> 29:27.500
It came right through
the walls..

29:29.083 --> 29:30.458
...like a hot wind.

29:33.375 --> 29:36.167
'The first man died
just meters from me.'

29:36.250 --> 29:39.208
Never even screamed.

29:39.292 --> 29:40.542
We ran.

29:43.625 --> 29:45.167
We ran.

29:47.833 --> 29:49.750
For a second,
I thought I lost it.

29:51.125 --> 29:53.333
'Then I saw it.'

29:53.417 --> 29:57.417
Standing in the middle
of a ball of lightning.

29:59.458 --> 30:02.583
It looked like it had come
straight from hell.

30:05.167 --> 30:06.542
How did you survive?

30:08.042 --> 30:09.375
I didn't.

30:14.958 --> 30:16.167
[sniffles]

30:18.750 --> 30:22.042
It kept me alive..

30:22.125 --> 30:23.500
...as a snack.

30:24.625 --> 30:26.250
It becomes part of you

30:26.333 --> 30:27.750
feeding on you.

30:27.833 --> 30:30.250
The lucky ones were the men
who died on that moon.

30:30.333 --> 30:32.542
What it took from me
I can never get back.

30:32.625 --> 30:34.208
When the rescue party
showed up

30:34.292 --> 30:36.917
I weighed 85 pounds.

30:38.250 --> 30:41.583
'That's how I knew
it was on this station.'

30:44.667 --> 30:47.208
A part of me is still
inside that thing.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.500
I can feel it.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.292
But nobody ever believed me.

30:54.417 --> 30:55.667
Until now.

30:57.292 --> 30:59.833
This feeling,
can it lead you to it?

31:02.292 --> 31:03.708
I think.

31:06.667 --> 31:09.167
I think maybe
that's what it's been doing..

31:10.875 --> 31:13.083
...all this time.

31:15.792 --> 31:18.875
They're calling me, I think.

31:18.958 --> 31:22.958
Maybe we have some unfinished
business between us.

31:23.042 --> 31:25.250
Amis!

31:25.333 --> 31:26.792
Amis!

31:35.375 --> 31:37.125
Mariah.

31:37.208 --> 31:39.458
What are you doing here?

31:39.542 --> 31:41.583
It's all I have now.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.000
This..

31:43.083 --> 31:45.292
...my memories..

31:45.375 --> 31:46.750
...and you.

31:48.042 --> 31:51.667
Or, maybe I'm assuming
more than I should.

31:51.750 --> 31:56.583
I just think this is happening
a little fast, don't you?

31:56.667 --> 31:59.292
You just lost your husband.

31:59.375 --> 32:00.500
I know.

32:02.208 --> 32:05.125
And I'd be lying if I said
I don't miss him.

32:05.208 --> 32:06.708
I do.

32:06.792 --> 32:08.875
And I wanna find
whatever killed him.

32:10.958 --> 32:12.583
But I'd also be lying
if I said

32:12.667 --> 32:14.375
things were perfect
between us.

32:16.333 --> 32:17.458
Before we left Earth

32:17.542 --> 32:18.750
Will and I
must have split up

32:18.833 --> 32:20.500
half a dozen times.

32:22.417 --> 32:26.583
After a while,
all we had in common..

32:26.667 --> 32:28.208
...were the stars..

32:29.583 --> 32:30.917
...and dreams.

32:33.083 --> 32:34.833
You can go far on that.

32:37.083 --> 32:38.667
A 100 years.

32:41.750 --> 32:43.083
What about you?

32:45.458 --> 32:47.875
The same problem, I guess.

32:47.958 --> 32:49.833
I mean, my work..

32:49.917 --> 32:51.125
...comes first.

32:51.208 --> 32:52.542
Always has.

32:53.833 --> 32:57.042
Finding someone who
understands that, uh..

32:57.125 --> 32:59.583
Well, it hasn't been easy.

32:59.667 --> 33:00.958
And this place

33:01.042 --> 33:03.708
isn't exactly ideal
for raising a family.

33:05.667 --> 33:06.833
No, it's not.

33:09.042 --> 33:11.708
Maybe it's just as well
Will never woke up.

33:13.458 --> 33:15.958
I don't think he would have
liked this world.

33:18.250 --> 33:19.583
Mariah..

33:23.583 --> 33:26.292
Whatever killed your husband
is on this station

33:26.375 --> 33:28.542
and has taken another life.

33:28.625 --> 33:32.875
Now I need to know
everything that you know.

33:36.500 --> 33:39.000
In my dreams..

33:39.083 --> 33:42.458
...there's something
in the life tube with me.

33:45.250 --> 33:48.667
and I think it was
using me to stay alive

33:48.750 --> 33:50.708
until it could find
more food.

33:53.042 --> 33:54.500
Babylon 5.

33:56.667 --> 33:58.917
I've put everybody here
in great danger.

34:21.125 --> 34:23.583
[Amis screaming]

34:27.292 --> 34:28.458
Official accounts

34:28.542 --> 34:30.167
of the massacre
at the listening post

34:30.250 --> 34:32.333
blame the attack
on the Minbari.

34:32.417 --> 34:35.292
Amis may not be sure of much
but he is sure of one thing.

34:35.375 --> 34:37.667
That post was not attacked
by the Minbari.

34:37.750 --> 34:40.667
He said it was as if
hell had been let loose.

34:40.750 --> 34:42.625
Well, that doesn't help us much.

34:42.708 --> 34:46.042
No, but he also said
the alien took a part of him

34:46.125 --> 34:47.625
when he left his body.

34:47.708 --> 34:50.875
T-that he could feel
its presence on the station.

34:50.958 --> 34:53.042
Some kind of symbiosis?

34:53.125 --> 34:54.375
That may be.

34:54.458 --> 34:56.333
Then if the same thing
happened to Mariah

34:56.417 --> 34:57.917
she might be able
to help us find it.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.458
It's too risky.

34:59.542 --> 35:01.583
Whatever's on the station
came from her ship.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.083
If what the lurker
said is true

35:03.167 --> 35:05.542
and there is some kind of
symbiotic relationship

35:05.625 --> 35:08.458
who knows what kind of influence
it may have over her.

35:08.542 --> 35:09.875
You know, she could
be scouting for it

35:09.958 --> 35:11.500
without knowing
what she's doing.

35:11.583 --> 35:13.875
Well, if what happened on that
listening post is happening here

35:13.958 --> 35:15.917
we're not gonna have
to go looking for it.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.708
It'll find us.

35:17.792 --> 35:19.667
'Let's just make sure
we're ready for it.'

35:20.792 --> 35:23.000
[dramatic music]

35:42.208 --> 35:43.542
Miss Cirrus.

35:45.542 --> 35:48.208
Oh, Mr. Garibaldi.

35:48.292 --> 35:50.042
Yes.

35:50.125 --> 35:53.542
I need your help
to find a friend.

35:53.625 --> 35:55.792
Dr. Franklin told me
about him.

35:55.875 --> 35:56.958
I'm sorry.

35:58.833 --> 36:00.292
Can you find this thing?

36:00.375 --> 36:02.250
Can you feel where it is?

36:04.458 --> 36:06.375
I think so.

36:06.458 --> 36:08.167
I can try.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.000
Provided her doctor comes along.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.083
We're getting reports
of weapons fire in brown 90.

36:22.167 --> 36:23.500
Then part of a signal came in.

36:23.583 --> 36:25.500
I think it was Garibaldi.
Then it was cut off.

36:25.583 --> 36:26.708
Seal off the area.

36:26.792 --> 36:28.417
I don't want anyone in there.

36:29.792 --> 36:31.042
- Sheridan to Franklin.
- I tried him.

36:31.125 --> 36:32.417
He's not answering.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.333
I'd say they found it.

36:34.417 --> 36:35.542
Break out heavy weapons.

36:35.625 --> 36:37.792
Have a security detail
meet us down there.

36:39.042 --> 36:41.083
[dramatic music]

36:50.042 --> 36:51.667
- 'You alright?'
- Garibaldi pulled him out.

36:51.750 --> 36:52.917
He went back in.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.500
Alright. You two
stay here with them.

36:54.583 --> 36:55.750
You let us know
if it doubles back.

36:55.833 --> 36:57.833
I don't want it to escape.

36:57.917 --> 36:59.167
You ready?

37:18.250 --> 37:19.542
You got a plan?

37:19.625 --> 37:22.500
- Just try not to get killed.
- Brilliant.

37:38.083 --> 37:39.167
Amis!

37:47.000 --> 37:48.042
Amis!

37:48.125 --> 37:50.917
Kill it! Kill it!
Shoot! Shoot!

37:51.000 --> 37:53.292
[gun zaps]

37:56.708 --> 37:57.750
Get up!

37:57.833 --> 37:59.208
Come on!

37:59.292 --> 38:00.500
It's gotta be stopped.

38:00.583 --> 38:02.917
You finished
your tour of duty.

38:07.083 --> 38:08.042
Get down!

38:08.125 --> 38:09.833
[zapping]

38:18.500 --> 38:20.292
Calling..

38:20.375 --> 38:22.708
It knows I'm here,
and it's waiting for me.

38:24.583 --> 38:26.875
These PPG's don't do
much more than sting it.

38:26.958 --> 38:28.208
Prowls around
hurt for a while

38:28.292 --> 38:29.375
but it comes back stronger.

38:29.458 --> 38:30.542
Yeah.

38:30.625 --> 38:32.458
One bee sting
may be a annoyance

38:32.542 --> 38:35.542
but a 100 of 'em
can kill you.

38:35.625 --> 38:37.958
Ivanova, you got a fix
on my position?

38:38.042 --> 38:39.250
(Susan)
'Confirmed. On our way.'

38:39.333 --> 38:40.500
No, negative.

38:40.583 --> 38:42.708
Triangulate your fire
and stand by.

38:42.792 --> 38:46.042
I wanna set up a kill zone,
point-blank.

38:46.125 --> 38:47.542
How's your charge?

38:47.625 --> 38:49.417
I'm down to my last cap.

38:49.500 --> 38:50.542
Well, let's hope
that's enough.

38:50.625 --> 38:52.292
(Amis)
'It won't work.'

38:52.375 --> 38:53.917
It's too smart for that.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.875
It can smell a trap.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.625
It can wait.

38:57.708 --> 38:59.292
It's patient.

38:59.375 --> 39:00.875
It's patient.

39:02.333 --> 39:03.542
You've gotta give it
what it wants!

39:03.625 --> 39:05.083
- Amis, no!
- Hey!

39:05.167 --> 39:06.917
Alright, I'm here!

39:07.000 --> 39:08.333
You wanted me?

39:08.417 --> 39:10.125
Here I am!

39:10.208 --> 39:11.500
Let's finish it!

39:13.000 --> 39:14.083
Come on!

39:15.500 --> 39:18.292
No more dreams.
Let's end it.

39:21.625 --> 39:24.917
Amis, get clear!
Amis!

39:25.000 --> 39:26.292
[screaming]

39:27.625 --> 39:28.917
Open fire!

39:29.000 --> 39:30.625
[gunfire]

39:33.542 --> 39:35.625
[alien shrieking]

39:43.042 --> 39:44.833
(Michael)
We got it, Amis.

39:44.917 --> 39:46.458
We got it.

39:46.542 --> 39:48.458
No more bad dreams.

39:48.542 --> 39:49.583
It's over.

39:50.917 --> 39:52.208
It's over.

40:00.250 --> 40:02.167
[dramatic music]

40:14.292 --> 40:15.625
You sure
he's gonna be okay?

40:15.708 --> 40:17.625
He's just banged up.

40:17.708 --> 40:20.083
I gave him something
to help him sleep.

40:20.167 --> 40:22.500
All he wanted
was to be set free.

40:22.583 --> 40:23.792
To forget.

40:23.875 --> 40:25.333
Maybe now he can.

40:26.750 --> 40:28.750
So, what about you?

40:28.833 --> 40:30.250
What about me?

40:30.333 --> 40:32.000
Well, you're gonna need
a place to stay

40:32.083 --> 40:33.792
and this is
good a place as any.

40:33.875 --> 40:35.750
I can help.

40:35.833 --> 40:38.458
I thought about it,
but I-I can't.

40:38.542 --> 40:40.292
Not yet, anyway.

40:41.458 --> 40:44.500
I have a 100 years
to catch up on.

40:44.583 --> 40:46.417
I need to see Earth.

40:47.583 --> 40:49.375
Bury Will..

40:49.458 --> 40:50.917
...mourn for a while.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.958
I just need time.

40:56.083 --> 40:58.167
If I can, I'll come back.

40:58.250 --> 41:00.333
If you're still interested.

41:00.417 --> 41:03.125
I think there's
a good chance of that.

41:03.208 --> 41:06.042
Don't make promises
life won't let you keep.

41:11.917 --> 41:13.458
Take care, Stephen.

41:23.292 --> 41:25.292
Captain, we just got finished
analyzing the database

41:25.375 --> 41:27.125
onboard the Copernicus.

41:27.208 --> 41:29.292
Took us a while to go through
100 years of routine entries

41:29.375 --> 41:31.500
but so far, everything
she told us checks out.

41:31.583 --> 41:33.708
I think we kind of
figured that out by now.

41:33.792 --> 41:35.208
Not entirely.

41:35.292 --> 41:37.083
There's one more thing
I figured you ought to know.

41:37.167 --> 41:38.667
According to the ship's log

41:38.750 --> 41:40.375
the Copernicus
lost 10% of its oxygen

41:40.458 --> 41:45.000
when it passed by a moon
in Sector 18 by 70 by 59.

41:45.083 --> 41:47.125
Which would have been caused
when that thing came aboard.

41:47.208 --> 41:48.250
Exactly.

41:48.333 --> 41:49.833
But when it left that sector

41:49.917 --> 41:51.667
it was heading
on a new course.

41:51.750 --> 41:54.333
That thing must have been more
intelligent than we thought.

41:54.417 --> 41:56.250
Fortunately, it didn't know that
the ship was also programmed

41:56.333 --> 41:58.458
to make contact with any
signals it came across.

41:58.542 --> 42:00.250
Otherwise, it would have
just gone right by

42:00.333 --> 42:02.208
and we never would
have known it was there.

42:05.250 --> 42:07.542
You said the ship
was reprogrammed

42:07.625 --> 42:09.250
to a new destination.

42:09.333 --> 42:10.125
Yeah.

42:10.208 --> 42:11.750
So, where was it going?

42:11.833 --> 42:13.625
It was heading
for the Rim.

42:13.708 --> 42:15.583
Toward the exact place
where ambassador G'kar

42:15.667 --> 42:18.583
told us an ancient enemy
was gathering its forces.

42:18.667 --> 42:19.750
Z'ha'dum.

42:19.833 --> 42:22.375
Do you think
it's a coincidence?

42:22.458 --> 42:25.333
A few weeks ago, I probably
would have said yes.

42:25.417 --> 42:27.333
But, now, no.

42:28.875 --> 42:31.125
Something's going on, commander.

42:31.208 --> 42:33.250
I know.

42:33.333 --> 42:35.000
Between you and me..

42:35.083 --> 42:37.250
...it's scaring
the hell out of me.

42:38.500 --> 42:40.542
[suspenseful music]

42:52.500 --> 42:53.792
[exhales sharply]

43:06.083 --> 43:08.625
[theme music]
