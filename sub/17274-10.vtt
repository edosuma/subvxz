00:00.020 --> 00:01.564
<i>Previously on</i>
Covert Affairs..

00:01.565 --> 00:03.085
I saw you on the street
with that girl.

00:03.109 --> 00:05.969
I was just another Op,
and then you broke it off

00:06.086 --> 00:07.720
because I wasn't necessary
anymore.

00:07.838 --> 00:09.088
There's a little snafu
at the Russian embassy.

00:09.223 --> 00:11.303
One of their diplomats
was arrested with a call girl.

00:11.342 --> 00:13.182
I thought you said
you knew how to be discreet.

00:13.333 --> 00:15.413
Being discreet doesn't mean
there's no risk involved.

00:15.519 --> 00:17.230
- I'm done.
- Don't call me again.

00:17.381 --> 00:19.349
Tony, how are things
at the state department?

00:19.483 --> 00:21.123
- Pretty good.
- There's a version of this

00:21.147 --> 00:22.318
that ties McQuaid to Chicago.

00:22.436 --> 00:24.437
You know no one has better
access to McQuaid than I do.

00:24.572 --> 00:26.012
And you know
you're under suspension.

00:26.090 --> 00:27.240
That's part of my plan.

00:27.391 --> 00:29.151
I am gonna make a move
to the private sector.

00:29.175 --> 00:30.777
- How about a toast?
- How about a job?

00:30.911 --> 00:32.529
It's with great pleasure
that I introduce

00:32.662 --> 00:34.697
our newest field operative,
Annie Walker.

00:34.832 --> 00:36.192
Does McQuaid's Security
do mock-ups

00:36.216 --> 00:37.534
of the Ops your planning?

00:37.668 --> 00:38.668
You know McQuaid.

00:38.702 --> 00:40.837
He replicates
with intense detail.

00:40.955 --> 00:42.755
This is where they planned
the Chicago attack.

00:42.779 --> 00:44.123
It's time we took this
to Langley.

00:44.258 --> 00:45.875
The Semtex used in Chicago

00:46.010 --> 00:47.770
was the same you found
in McQuaid's facility.

00:47.794 --> 00:49.262
Pull McQuaid in.

00:49.413 --> 00:51.598
If you think
that I am capable of this,

00:51.748 --> 00:53.466
then shoot me.

00:53.601 --> 00:55.385
Someone tipped McQuaid off
about the manhunt.

00:55.553 --> 00:56.719
He's in the wind.

00:56.887 --> 00:58.638
You think he'd try
and contact you?

00:58.772 --> 01:00.690
No, he's gotta know
what side I'm on by now.

01:04.311 --> 01:06.563
Just on the left up here.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074

01:19.543 --> 01:21.077
Thanks, buddy.
Keep the change.

01:21.245 --> 01:23.296
No problem.

02:24.927 --> 02:27.178
Thank you
for sitting down.

02:27.296 --> 02:29.631
This is just pro forma,
okay?

02:29.765 --> 02:33.051
We have to talk to everyone.

02:33.185 --> 02:37.055
How would you categorize your
relationship with Ryan McQuaid?

02:37.189 --> 02:39.474
Ryan was my boss,
but only for a short time.

02:39.642 --> 02:42.610
We did CIA field Ops together,

02:42.728 --> 02:45.146
and I--and I would say
we worked well together.

02:45.314 --> 02:46.648
I considered him a friend.

02:46.782 --> 02:48.867
Do you have any idea

02:49.017 --> 02:50.735
where McQuaid might run to?

02:50.886 --> 02:52.454
No.

02:52.571 --> 02:55.824
But I'm sure he's long gone
by now.

02:55.958 --> 02:58.042
Why would you think that?

02:58.193 --> 03:00.044
I would be
if I were him.

03:32.895 --> 03:35.914
British, Australian,
Canadian.

03:36.064 --> 03:38.032
What do you want?

03:38.167 --> 03:39.501
Australian's fine.

03:39.618 --> 03:42.587
What happened to the other
ones I did for you before?

03:42.738 --> 03:44.672
I just need a clean slate,
no chances.

03:44.790 --> 03:46.591
Really?
You're in a bind.

03:53.265 --> 03:54.716
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

03:54.850 --> 03:56.217
Finding McQuaid's
a top priority,

03:56.302 --> 03:58.262
so for now, they're just
picking everybody's brain

03:58.286 --> 03:59.470
trying to get a beat on him.

03:59.605 --> 04:01.189
- For now?
- Well, inquiries like this

04:01.307 --> 04:03.358
have a way of snowballing.

04:03.475 --> 04:05.435
They'll be looking at everyone
in McQuaid's orbit,

04:05.528 --> 04:07.288
including you and me,
if they aren't already.

04:07.312 --> 04:09.230
Caitlyn seems to be
handling it well.

04:09.365 --> 04:11.115
With the CIA
turning this place inside out,

04:11.266 --> 04:12.867
I'd expect her to be
less composed.

04:12.952 --> 04:14.235
That's because
she invited them.

04:14.370 --> 04:16.286
Why did she do that?

04:16.438 --> 04:17.906
Damage control.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.958
She gave the CIA
carte Blanche

04:20.075 --> 04:21.515
and they agreed
to keep the Op quiet.

04:21.649 --> 04:23.609
Unfortunately, you can't keep
anything under wraps

04:23.634 --> 04:24.913
in this town.

04:24.997 --> 04:27.582
Words already starting to spread
amongst our clients.

04:27.716 --> 04:29.551
We've already lost three
government contracts.

04:32.287 --> 04:33.972
Have you considered
the possibility

04:34.122 --> 04:35.242
of Ryan reaching out to you?

04:35.307 --> 04:37.392
The thought
has crossed my mind.

04:37.509 --> 04:38.927
Piece of advice.

04:39.061 --> 04:42.564
We're all under the microscope
right now.

04:42.681 --> 04:44.349
So put your feelings aside.

04:44.483 --> 04:48.269
Don't do anything
to put yourself at risk.

04:48.404 --> 04:51.606
Okay.

04:59.748 --> 05:01.866
Here it is.
Clone away.

05:02.001 --> 05:03.451
There may not be much on it.
I haven't been here very long.

05:03.586 --> 05:05.837
Thank you. I will get this
right back to you, I promise.

05:05.955 --> 05:08.423
Oh, um, quick question.

05:08.507 --> 05:11.509
You know those doughnuts
in your guys' break room?

05:11.660 --> 05:13.540
Do you think it'd be weird
if I had some of 'em?

05:13.564 --> 05:15.463
Considering you're
investigating the guy

05:15.598 --> 05:16.598
who paid for them?
Hmm.

05:16.665 --> 05:18.132
Definitely.

05:18.217 --> 05:21.219
Oh, okay, 'cause I already ate
most of 'em.

05:21.353 --> 05:22.887
Um...

05:23.022 --> 05:24.639
I need to ask a favor, too.

05:24.773 --> 05:25.940
Yeah?

05:26.025 --> 05:28.026
I need Caitlyn Cook's
computer.

05:28.176 --> 05:29.811
- Mm-hmm.
- I'd ask her myself,

05:29.895 --> 05:32.814
but I'm--I'm slightly terrified
of her.

05:32.948 --> 05:34.782
I'll get it for you.

05:34.900 --> 05:37.318
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

06:01.343 --> 06:03.394
What are you doing in here?

06:03.545 --> 06:06.347
The tech op needed to clone
your computer.

06:06.432 --> 06:08.399
I'm about to step into
a meeting.

06:08.550 --> 06:10.518
Do you know
when they'll be done?

06:10.653 --> 06:11.903
I'm not sure, but I can
ask him to do it right away.

06:12.021 --> 06:13.571
- Fine.
- He said he also needed to see

06:13.689 --> 06:16.524
Ryan's computer,
but it wasn't in his office.

06:16.659 --> 06:19.360
Do you have any idea
where it is?

06:19.495 --> 06:21.829
I have no idea.
Maybe it's at his house.

06:21.914 --> 06:24.332
Okay.

06:24.416 --> 06:26.250
Thanks.

06:26.401 --> 06:28.252
Thank you.

06:38.681 --> 06:40.264
I brought you a snack.

06:40.382 --> 06:42.350
Oh, thank you so much.

06:42.468 --> 06:44.469
For the computer, too,

06:44.603 --> 06:46.054
but the doughnuts especially.

06:46.221 --> 06:47.741
- Are you done with mine?
- Yeah, yeah.

06:47.756 --> 06:49.396
Just unplug it. It's all yours.
Thank you.

06:49.475 --> 06:53.311
Thanks.

06:53.428 --> 06:54.896
Yeah.

06:55.030 --> 06:57.198
Walker, these came for you.

06:57.316 --> 06:59.033
Thanks.

07:09.111 --> 07:10.461
One other thing.

07:10.612 --> 07:12.663
Since this manhunt is
a multiagency operation,

07:12.798 --> 07:14.582
NCTC will be coordinating
the effort.

07:14.717 --> 07:16.384
They're sending over someone

07:16.502 --> 07:18.102
to help comb through the Intel
coming in.

07:18.220 --> 07:20.138
- To help?
- Yeah, I know.

07:20.288 --> 07:22.256
They don't trust us
to share well with others.

07:22.341 --> 07:23.758
When do they get here?

07:23.926 --> 07:25.593
Now.

07:25.677 --> 07:27.095
Hello, Auggie.

07:29.982 --> 07:31.065
Perfect.

07:31.183 --> 07:33.017
Hey, got a sec?

07:33.135 --> 07:35.153
Just.
What's up?

07:35.303 --> 07:37.271
Who do you know
at the Russian embassy?

07:37.406 --> 07:38.940
I know everyone.

07:39.074 --> 07:42.577
But I have a relationship in the
cultural attache's office, why?

07:42.694 --> 07:45.947
I need you
to meet with them.

08:02.598 --> 08:06.350
Did you like the flowers?

08:06.468 --> 08:09.637
Yeah.
They're beautiful.

08:09.772 --> 08:11.973
You got a phone on you?

08:18.614 --> 08:21.149
Uh...

08:21.283 --> 08:23.201
I'm the one who didn't shoot
at you, remember?

08:23.351 --> 08:26.287
Yes,
and I appreciate that.

08:26.405 --> 08:28.322
But you're not the one
that I'm worried about.

08:28.457 --> 08:30.491
This place is amazing.

08:30.626 --> 08:32.743
Plenty of cover,

08:32.878 --> 08:34.879
great sight lines
to the access road,

08:35.030 --> 08:37.331
acres of trees
to disappear in.

08:37.466 --> 08:41.085
You sure know how to make
a spy blush.

08:41.220 --> 08:43.504
I still have
a lot of questions.

08:43.672 --> 08:44.806
So do I.

08:44.923 --> 08:47.141
My wings are
completely clipped.

08:47.259 --> 08:49.227
I can't even check
my e-mails

08:49.344 --> 08:50.895
without the CIA
knowing about it.

08:51.046 --> 08:53.064
I've been cut off
from my money.

08:53.215 --> 08:56.767
I know this is a lot to ask--
I'm in.

08:59.071 --> 09:01.155
I was hoping
you'd say that.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.080
I've been thinking a lot
about who it might be.

09:03.197 --> 09:04.831
Me, too, and I don't think
you're gonna like the answer.

09:04.982 --> 09:07.111
- You think it was Caitlyn.
- How do you know?

09:07.246 --> 09:09.206
'Cause it had to have been
somebody who has access

09:09.248 --> 09:11.115
to my company
and my operations,

09:11.250 --> 09:12.667
and she's the most obvious
choice.

09:12.784 --> 09:14.418
- But?
- But she's never given me

09:14.536 --> 09:16.287
a reason
to distrust her, Annie.

09:16.421 --> 09:19.423
She contacted me last night
about arranging a meet.

09:19.574 --> 09:22.760
She's just trying to help me
figure it out.

09:22.911 --> 09:24.712
She gave the CIA free rein
at your company,

09:24.847 --> 09:26.264
and then she held back
your laptop from them.

09:26.414 --> 09:27.715
Maybe she's trying
to protect me.

09:27.883 --> 09:29.634
Maybe she's trying to plant
evidence on it.

09:29.751 --> 09:32.720
Shit.

09:32.855 --> 09:34.722
You know, if I'm being
completely honest,

09:34.890 --> 09:36.490
Caitlyn's a pretty big
blind spot for me.

09:36.591 --> 09:40.394
You think it's worth the risk
to take the meet?

09:40.529 --> 09:43.481
If she's setting me up,
we need to know now.

09:43.598 --> 09:45.718
Look, I'll keep the meet
and I'll move it to someplace

09:45.734 --> 09:47.401
that you can
keep an eye on things.

09:47.536 --> 09:49.570
If it's a trap,
then you can warn me.

09:51.490 --> 09:53.574
Let's do it.

10:09.073 --> 10:10.513
If they're looking
to black bag me,

10:10.537 --> 10:11.653
they'll send in a few guys

10:11.653 --> 10:13.370
to try and push me
out of the circle,

10:13.488 --> 10:15.122
and they'll try
and take me someplace

10:15.257 --> 10:16.840
and quietly drop a net on me.

10:16.992 --> 10:18.272
Well, I'll see them coming
first.

10:18.296 --> 10:20.344
I can cover every approach,

10:20.495 --> 10:22.175
but try to stick to one part
of the circle,

10:22.259 --> 10:23.619
say between 19th
and New Hampshire,

10:23.744 --> 10:25.683
what do you plan on doing
with that?

10:25.833 --> 10:27.851
Hopefully nothing.

10:27.969 --> 10:30.971
But if things get hot, I can buy
you enough time to get away.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.359
What about you?

10:35.477 --> 10:37.728
I'll be fine.

10:56.514 --> 10:58.882
It's me.
Well, my guy's a no-show.

10:59.017 --> 11:01.051
I'll be back at the office
in an hour.

11:07.442 --> 11:09.522
Okay, I've got McQuaid
mission files from '08 to '09,

11:09.546 --> 11:10.546
who wants 'em?

11:10.645 --> 11:13.363
- I'll take 'em.
- Right here.

11:14.866 --> 11:18.568
Okay, I'm just gonna
leave them

11:18.686 --> 11:21.371
on these boxes right here, that
way nobody has to get mad at me.

11:24.909 --> 11:28.328
And sorry to interrupt
the awkwardness again,

11:28.413 --> 11:31.999
but there's a phone call
for Haley from Hoover.

11:32.133 --> 11:33.216
Oh, great.

11:33.334 --> 11:37.137
Thanks.
I'm gonna take that in here.

11:37.255 --> 11:40.140
Could you just give me
a minute?

11:40.258 --> 11:42.676
Are you serious?

11:42.844 --> 11:44.928
Please?

11:53.154 --> 11:54.604
What do we got?

11:54.739 --> 11:56.857
We tracked Walker's phone
going into the arboretum,

11:57.025 --> 11:58.742
but then the signal vanished.

11:58.893 --> 12:01.078
- Did you get eyes on her?
- It's 412 acres.

12:01.228 --> 12:03.113
There's only so much
we can cover.

12:03.247 --> 12:04.915
We checked
the security footage.

12:05.066 --> 12:07.284
As far as I could see,
she was alone the whole time.

12:07.401 --> 12:10.537
Can you get me a map of where
all the security cameras are,

12:10.672 --> 12:13.123
along with their range of view?
Sure. Why?

12:13.257 --> 12:15.342
'Cause I wanna find
all the gaps in their coverage

12:15.426 --> 12:17.266
and then check every single one
of those spots.

12:17.290 --> 12:20.226
Call me when you get it.

12:21.432 --> 12:23.717
Finished.

12:23.851 --> 12:26.720
I can't believe you think
Annie's working with McQuaid.

12:26.854 --> 12:28.438
Were you eavesdropping?

12:28.589 --> 12:30.389
I didn't need to.
You send me out of my office

12:30.441 --> 12:33.360
to talk to the FBI.
Who else is it gonna be about?

12:33.478 --> 12:34.728
I'm a spy, remember?

12:34.862 --> 12:37.364
Oh, yeah. I'm not
discussing this with you.

12:37.482 --> 12:38.982
Then just look at the facts.
If she were abetting him,

12:39.117 --> 12:41.317
she wouldn't have told the CIA
about that secret bunker.

12:41.341 --> 12:42.836
You're wasting your time.

12:42.937 --> 12:44.371
I read
the after action report,

12:44.489 --> 12:46.323
or rather,
I read between the lines.

12:46.457 --> 12:48.738
If she's sleeping with him,
she's probably protecting him.

12:48.776 --> 12:51.244
You need to rework
your profile on Annie,

12:51.379 --> 12:53.964
because that particular code
isn't in her programming.

12:54.115 --> 12:57.417
Auggie, maybe you don't
know her like you used to.

12:57.585 --> 12:59.086
She keeps things from you.

12:59.220 --> 13:01.221
She disappears for months.

13:01.339 --> 13:03.090
I mean, what kind of a friend
does that?

13:03.257 --> 13:04.457
The kind who needs
some privacy

13:04.559 --> 13:05.999
and knew I wouldn't judge her
for it.

13:06.023 --> 13:09.096
Keeping secrets is not
the same thing as privacy.

13:09.180 --> 13:10.897
You know what?

13:12.466 --> 13:14.518
Maybe you're right.

13:14.652 --> 13:18.105
You shouldn't be talking to me
about this.

13:33.538 --> 13:36.006
You have two bogeys
at your 3 o'clock.

13:49.637 --> 13:51.855
This feels wrong.

13:52.006 --> 13:53.857
You're fine.
They didn't make you.

13:54.008 --> 13:55.075
No, it's not that.

13:55.176 --> 13:58.145
It's this whole setup--
the sniper rifle,

13:58.279 --> 13:59.999
not giving Caitlyn
the benefit of the doubt.

14:00.023 --> 14:01.531
It just feels like
we're testing her.

14:01.649 --> 14:03.533
It is a test.

14:03.684 --> 14:05.204
If I'm wrong,
she doesn't have to know,

14:05.228 --> 14:07.704
but I don't think I am.

14:07.855 --> 14:09.739
You don't know her
like I do.

14:09.857 --> 14:12.576
She's been there for me through
one of the most difficult times

14:12.710 --> 14:14.461
of my life.

14:14.545 --> 14:16.129
What happened?

14:21.469 --> 14:23.553
Years ago, I was married.

14:23.704 --> 14:26.840
Her name was Kelly,
and she died.

14:26.924 --> 14:29.559
Cancer.

14:29.677 --> 14:33.146
Losing her almost destroyed me,
but Caitlyn wouldn't let it.

14:33.264 --> 14:35.344
Without her I wouldn't have
climbed out of that hole.

14:35.368 --> 14:37.767
So...

14:37.902 --> 14:41.071
She's here.

14:43.390 --> 14:44.941
I don't see any undercovers.

14:47.528 --> 14:49.029
Hey.

14:49.163 --> 14:51.615
Let's take a walk.

14:51.749 --> 14:52.949
How are you?

14:53.084 --> 14:55.118
You know me,
every day is an adventure.

14:55.253 --> 14:58.622
Why the last-minute
location change?

14:58.756 --> 15:00.373
Don't you trust me?

15:00.541 --> 15:02.701
It's a luxury I don't have
much time for at the moment.

15:02.725 --> 15:05.095
After everything we've been
through together?

15:05.246 --> 15:07.126
Well, try looking at it
from where I'm standing.

15:07.150 --> 15:08.181
Someone is setting me up,

15:08.299 --> 15:09.933
and they're using my company
to do it.

15:10.084 --> 15:12.185
Who would you look at?
You're right.

15:12.303 --> 15:13.854
I would be suspicious of me,
too.

15:13.938 --> 15:17.357
We're gonna find the son
of a bitch that did this to you.

15:17.475 --> 15:19.726
Here.

15:23.781 --> 15:25.866
Why'd you bring my laptop
here?

15:25.983 --> 15:28.535
There's all your contacts
and mission files on it.

15:28.653 --> 15:30.871
Jesus, Ryan,
I'm trying to help you.

15:30.988 --> 15:32.706
I'm just saying
it would have been hard

15:32.790 --> 15:35.242
to keep it from the CIA.

15:35.376 --> 15:38.161
I assume they're
turning the place upside down.

15:38.279 --> 15:39.579
It's been a nightmare.

15:39.664 --> 15:41.384
I tried to keep them out
as long as I could,

15:41.448 --> 15:43.833
the lawyers said there was
nothing I could do about it.

15:47.138 --> 15:48.738
I'm sorry it's been
so difficult for you.

15:48.756 --> 15:50.724
Don't worry about me.

15:50.841 --> 15:52.926
Is there anything I can do
for you right now?

15:53.094 --> 15:55.312
No, no. You--you've done
quite enough already.

15:55.429 --> 15:58.148
Well, I'm here for you
if you need me.

16:13.648 --> 16:14.698
What do you think?

16:14.815 --> 16:16.416
She's a liar.

16:20.922 --> 16:23.206
Why do you think
she gave you that?

16:39.840 --> 16:41.641
That's a GPS chip.

16:41.809 --> 16:43.476
You wouldn't know it was there
unless you were looking for it.

16:43.611 --> 16:45.478
It draws power
from the battery,

16:45.613 --> 16:48.315
so the minute I plug this in,
it's gonna transmit my location.

16:50.868 --> 16:53.203
It was Caitlyn. It was her
the whole goddamn time.

17:02.202 --> 17:03.703
We just turned onto
Stuyvesant.

17:03.836 --> 17:05.704
What next?

17:07.089 --> 17:08.957
McQuaid, we just turned
onto Stuyvesant.

17:09.074 --> 17:11.926
Up on the right, 880.

17:13.463 --> 17:16.131
Are you okay?

17:16.248 --> 17:17.965
Yeah.

18:18.494 --> 18:20.078
I could use a drink.
You want one?

18:20.196 --> 18:22.080
Thanks.

18:28.004 --> 18:29.454
Wow.

18:29.622 --> 18:31.590
I'd ask why you have
something like this,

18:31.707 --> 18:34.593
but under the circumstances,
I get it.

18:34.710 --> 18:38.513
I just wanted someplace
that I could fight back from.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.527
You know, I took my eye
off the ball,

18:52.645 --> 18:53.895
and she knew it.

18:54.030 --> 18:56.565
I couldn't have made this
any easier for her!

18:56.682 --> 18:58.533
If you need to lose your shit
for a second,

18:58.684 --> 19:01.736
go ahead and do it.

19:01.871 --> 19:03.955
Then I need you to focus.

19:04.073 --> 19:05.707
'Cause we are in this
together.

20:17.146 --> 20:19.664
I'm sorry.
My hands are tied.

20:19.799 --> 20:21.733
State can't have diplomatic
protection contracts

20:21.867 --> 20:23.501
with McQuaid Security
right now.

20:23.603 --> 20:26.404
It boils down to
a PR issue.

20:26.539 --> 20:27.956
We were given the choice

20:28.107 --> 20:30.241
of either canceling the treaty
signing tomorrow

20:30.409 --> 20:32.160
or going with another PMC.

20:36.299 --> 20:37.582
Mr. Belenko.

20:37.717 --> 20:40.085
It's good to see you.

20:40.252 --> 20:41.970
Were we supposed to meet?
No.

20:42.121 --> 20:45.056
No, pardon the intrusion,
but as the treaty's organizer,

20:45.174 --> 20:47.509
I have a keen interest
in its security issues.

20:47.643 --> 20:49.094
- Arthur Campbell.
- Mr. Belenko.

20:49.378 --> 20:51.513
- Caitlyn Cook.
- Pleasure.

20:51.663 --> 20:54.465
We were just talking about
transferring the security detail

20:54.633 --> 20:56.351
elsewhere.

20:56.468 --> 20:57.719
I see.

20:57.853 --> 20:59.971
Bringing in someone else
this late in the game,

21:00.105 --> 21:02.857
it's more complicated
than you might realize.

21:03.008 --> 21:05.226
The security plan
took hundreds of hours.

21:05.344 --> 21:07.896
It would be impossible to bring
another pmc up to speed

21:08.030 --> 21:09.898
by tomorrow.
I'm sorry, guys.

21:10.032 --> 21:11.983
If you're dead set
against using us,

21:12.151 --> 21:13.701
the best move
is postpone it.

21:13.852 --> 21:16.237
There's nothing more important
than the client's safety.

21:16.355 --> 21:19.407
If it doesn't happen tomorrow,
it'll be staged abroad.

21:19.524 --> 21:21.492
A shame.

21:21.660 --> 21:24.078
I studied in the U.S.
did I tell you that?

21:24.213 --> 21:27.165
Boarding school at 13
and then university.

21:27.299 --> 21:29.551
This country helped me
become the man I am today,

21:29.668 --> 21:32.003
and this treaty
is my small way

21:32.137 --> 21:33.705
of giving something back.

21:36.926 --> 21:38.966
I'm impressed by the integrity
displayed here, Tony,

21:39.011 --> 21:40.762
and it would be a great favor
to me

21:40.896 --> 21:43.898
and my country
if we could proceed.

21:44.049 --> 21:46.684
Let me make a phone call.

21:46.819 --> 21:49.103
Thank you, Tony.
Caitlyn and I will be on-site

21:49.221 --> 21:50.701
to make sure everything
goes smoothly.

21:50.823 --> 21:52.857
If you're happy
with the event,

21:52.992 --> 21:55.026
maybe we can revisit
that contract conversation.

21:55.194 --> 21:56.694
One day at a time, Arthur.

21:59.231 --> 22:01.416
Thank you.

22:01.566 --> 22:04.085
Mr. Belenko.

22:19.584 --> 22:22.720
Maxim.

22:27.359 --> 22:28.726
What are you doing here?

22:28.894 --> 22:30.728
You blew through our meet.

22:30.813 --> 22:32.533
I was told not to talk
to anybody right now.

22:32.597 --> 22:36.067
Extra security protocols
are in effect.

22:36.201 --> 22:39.037
I thought we had
an arrangement.

22:39.154 --> 22:41.239
I can't help you.

23:03.595 --> 23:05.730
Thank you
for believing in me.

23:05.848 --> 23:08.182
I'm sorry
I ever doubted you.

23:08.317 --> 23:11.152
Well, I don't think
you really ever did.

23:15.190 --> 23:17.430
I've been thinking about
how we should deal with Caitlyn.

23:17.493 --> 23:20.945
Yeah, so have I.

23:21.080 --> 23:22.960
You know, if she wants
to send someone after me,

23:22.981 --> 23:24.332
then so be it.

23:24.450 --> 23:26.584
Every inch of this place
is wired.

23:26.669 --> 23:30.538
They will be like flies
in a spider's web.

23:32.458 --> 23:35.543
If Caitlyn wants to come
and get me,

23:35.660 --> 23:37.295
then...

23:38.497 --> 23:40.715
We'll send a flare.

24:04.689 --> 24:07.075
You ready?
Always.

24:46.698 --> 24:47.698
Are you okay?

24:50.068 --> 24:51.702
Piece of cake.

24:59.077 --> 25:01.712
Let's see what Santa brought us,
shall we?

25:01.847 --> 25:04.215
Oh, looks like we've been
naughty this year.

25:04.349 --> 25:06.434
- Potassium chloride.
- Induces a heart attack

25:06.552 --> 25:07.885
without leaving
a chemical trace.

25:08.020 --> 25:11.189
Semtex. This is not exactly
enough to damage this place,

25:11.273 --> 25:13.975
but maybe they wanted to blow me
up if the potassium didn't work.

25:14.109 --> 25:15.893
Or maybe they wanted
to just plant it on you.

25:15.978 --> 25:18.218
They've already pinned Chicago
on me. What else is there?

25:18.242 --> 25:20.026
Something that
hasn't happened yet.

25:24.102 --> 25:26.022
This is where all
the diplomats and military VIPs

25:26.038 --> 25:31.409
are staying
for the treaty signing.

25:38.608 --> 25:39.608
Hey, it's me.

25:39.861 --> 25:40.944
What's up?

25:41.078 --> 25:43.330
I think there's a bomb
in the Beaudmont Hotel

25:43.480 --> 25:45.480
someone is targeting
the dignitaries that are there

25:45.504 --> 25:46.616
for the treaty signing.

25:46.784 --> 25:49.002
- What's the Intel?
- Three men attacked McQuaid.

25:49.153 --> 25:52.038
They had Semtex and hotel
blueprints to plant on him.

25:52.156 --> 25:53.590
You're with--

25:53.708 --> 25:55.425
you're with McQuaid?

25:55.543 --> 25:57.594
I'll explain that later,
but right now,

25:57.712 --> 25:58.962
we have to evacuate that hotel

25:59.130 --> 26:01.381
in case somebody is targeting
the diplomats there.

26:01.516 --> 26:03.099
Yeah, I'm sending a team
right now.

26:03.217 --> 26:05.018
Then we need to talk.

26:16.113 --> 26:18.281
What's happening?

26:18.399 --> 26:19.699
There's a small
electrical fire,

26:19.817 --> 26:21.697
and we are evacuating the hotel
as a precaution,

26:21.702 --> 26:23.320
but it's nothing
to be concerned about.

26:23.487 --> 26:24.321
Thank you.

26:29.660 --> 26:31.461
Let's not jump
to any conclusions.

26:31.579 --> 26:33.713
The plan's still good, love.

26:51.799 --> 26:54.151
- Anything?
- Place is clear.

26:54.302 --> 26:56.542
They swept the entire hotel.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

26:56.566 --> 26:57.938
Better safe than sorry.

26:58.072 --> 27:01.241
I'm glad it turned out
to be a false alarm.

27:01.326 --> 27:03.327
So if you'll excuse us,
we'd better get our folks

27:03.477 --> 27:06.113
off to the treaty signing.

27:06.197 --> 27:07.865
Auggie.
Good to see you, Arthur.

27:07.999 --> 27:10.200
Hey, grab a bite later,
Anderson?

27:10.335 --> 27:13.120
Yeah. You buyin'?

27:15.489 --> 27:17.174
Tell me again
where that Intel came from.

27:19.511 --> 27:21.712
I found a few disparate pieces
of Intel

27:21.846 --> 27:23.297
on McQuaid's servers.

27:23.431 --> 27:26.099
I thought they fit together,
but apparently I was wrong.

27:27.936 --> 27:29.436
You need a ride
back to Langley?

27:29.521 --> 27:31.601
Thanks. I got a couple things
I have to wrap up here.

27:31.625 --> 27:33.559
All right.

27:43.701 --> 27:45.869
Miss Price, we got the prints
off the cell phone.

27:46.020 --> 27:48.188
- Who do you got?
- Two distinct sets.

27:48.323 --> 27:51.241
One belonging to Annie Walker,
the other to Ryan McQuaid.

27:58.866 --> 28:00.667
Hey, it's Hayley Price.

28:00.752 --> 28:03.337
I need an arrest warrant
for Annie Walker.

28:07.175 --> 28:08.559
Hey, Paul.

28:08.709 --> 28:10.677
I just got a call
from Hayley Price.

28:10.845 --> 28:12.846
She just tried
to swear out a warrant

28:12.931 --> 28:15.349
on Annie Walker.
For what?

28:15.516 --> 28:18.652
Abetting a fugitive
and obstruction of justice.

28:18.770 --> 28:20.604
Did you give it to her?

28:20.738 --> 28:22.217
No, I couldn't.

28:22.218 --> 28:23.569
There's a flag
on Walker's file

28:23.720 --> 28:25.200
saying that Langley
had to approve it.

28:25.224 --> 28:27.106
But Hayley didn't seem
to want to do that.

28:27.240 --> 28:29.158
Thanks, man.
I appreciate it.

28:29.276 --> 28:31.360
Say hi to Shelby for me, huh?
Will do.

28:38.618 --> 28:40.869
Auggie.

28:42.672 --> 28:44.006
Anything?

28:44.124 --> 28:46.041
It's clear.

28:46.176 --> 28:48.176
Now you're gonna tell me
what the hell is going on.

28:48.200 --> 28:49.678
McQuaid is innocent.

28:49.763 --> 28:51.797
Caitlyn Cook set him up.

28:51.932 --> 28:53.716
Yeah, he's innocent
based on what?

28:53.800 --> 28:56.185
She gave him a laptop
with a GPS tracker in it

28:56.269 --> 28:57.803
and then sent three men
to kill him.

28:57.938 --> 29:00.105
She must have done Chicago.

29:00.256 --> 29:01.736
She is trying to frame McQuaid
for it.

29:01.891 --> 29:03.058
All right,
if that's the case,

29:03.226 --> 29:04.643
then he shouldn't be afraid
to turn himself in.

29:04.778 --> 29:05.861
It's not that simple

29:05.979 --> 29:07.619
with all the evidence
stacked against him.

29:07.647 --> 29:10.566
That evidence should be
showing you something.

29:10.700 --> 29:13.869
I'm--I'm sorry
if this caused you problems.

29:13.954 --> 29:16.705
No, my problem is that I keep
sticking my neck out for you,

29:16.823 --> 29:18.324
and all you do is lie to me.

29:18.458 --> 29:20.042
- That's not true.
- Isn't it?

29:20.160 --> 29:21.327
What about McQuaid?

29:21.444 --> 29:22.878
Or your heart condition?

29:22.996 --> 29:24.913
Or wherever the hell you were
for four months

29:24.998 --> 29:26.415
that you didn't tell me

29:26.499 --> 29:29.385
until you needed my help
to cover it up?

29:29.502 --> 29:31.136
Look, I won't say anything
about McQuaid,

29:31.254 --> 29:34.473
but beyond that,
I'm done lying for you, Annie.

29:36.459 --> 29:38.019
Hayley already knows
you're helping him.

29:38.043 --> 29:41.063
She's asked
for an arrest warrant.

29:41.181 --> 29:43.349
The sooner you come clean,
the better chance you have

29:43.466 --> 29:46.185
of protecting yourself.

29:53.159 --> 29:56.612
My guy can't do us any favors
at the moment.

29:56.780 --> 29:58.500
Something's going on
at the Russian embassy.

29:58.634 --> 29:59.954
They've got the place
on lockdown.

29:59.978 --> 30:01.700
- In response to what?
- My best guess,

30:01.835 --> 30:03.335
stolen intelligence files,

30:03.486 --> 30:05.788
probably the same ones
Roger Bennett claimed he had.

30:05.955 --> 30:07.790
You think there could be
some FSB connection to all this?

30:07.874 --> 30:09.634
I mean, more than just the fact
that they had

30:09.676 --> 30:11.427
a surveillance file
on Borz Altan?

30:11.544 --> 30:13.045
I've had the same thought.

30:13.179 --> 30:15.764
If we can turn someone inside
the embassy, we can find out.

30:15.882 --> 30:18.717
So I've put together
a list of candidates.

30:25.007 --> 30:26.942
I think I have a way
to get to one of these guys.

30:27.077 --> 30:29.862
Who?

30:29.979 --> 30:31.864
Pavel Mashkov.

30:40.874 --> 30:43.042
Are you sure you want
to ask her to do

30:43.159 --> 30:46.045
what you have to ask her
to do?

30:46.195 --> 30:48.831
If there's an FSB connection
to Chicago,

30:48.915 --> 30:50.833
we need to know.

30:50.967 --> 30:54.136
And she may be the best shot we
have of getting someone inside.

30:54.254 --> 30:56.004
I've been through
the whole place myself.

30:56.089 --> 30:57.556
I couldn't find anything
either.

30:57.707 --> 30:58.867
Don't take this
the wrong way,

30:58.975 --> 31:01.510
but I'm sure the CIA team
was thorough.

31:01.678 --> 31:03.312
Yeah, well, then they must
have missed something, too.

31:03.430 --> 31:05.550
There's no reason for Caitlyn
to plant evidence on you

31:05.574 --> 31:08.484
tying you to the Beaudmont Hotel
if nothing's gonna happen there.

31:08.601 --> 31:11.403
Well, it was worth a try.

31:11.521 --> 31:14.022
I'm not giving up yet.
We're just--

31:14.190 --> 31:16.191
we're thinking about this
the wrong way.

31:16.326 --> 31:18.494
There is no more "we," okay?

31:18.611 --> 31:20.746
I've dragged you far enough
into this already.

31:20.897 --> 31:23.699
What are you talking about?

31:23.833 --> 31:25.313
You're on the verge
of being arrested.

31:25.401 --> 31:27.786
You don't have to go down
with me.

31:27.921 --> 31:30.202
Auggie was right. The sooner
you come forward, the better.

31:30.226 --> 31:32.341
Just--just tell him
I kidnapped you.

31:32.425 --> 31:33.542
Ryan,

31:33.626 --> 31:35.677
let me help you.

31:38.631 --> 31:39.515
Where are you?

31:43.303 --> 31:45.354
I'm gonna try something.
This needs to end now.

32:24.310 --> 32:25.310
Caitlyn.

32:25.345 --> 32:27.396
Jesus Christ, Ryan.

32:27.514 --> 32:29.148
You scared the shit out of me.

32:29.265 --> 32:30.399
What are you doing here?

32:30.517 --> 32:32.267
Where's the bomb?

32:43.328 --> 32:45.168
McQuaid, call me back
before you do something

32:45.589 --> 32:49.225
that can't be undone.

32:57.930 --> 32:59.680
It was never in the hotel.

33:02.401 --> 33:04.769
Annie Walker, put your hands
on your head,

33:04.937 --> 33:07.488
on your knees now!

33:09.191 --> 33:11.609
- I don't have time for this.
- I mean it, Annie.

33:11.743 --> 33:12.863
Put your hands on your head.

33:12.945 --> 33:14.705
Caitlyn Cook is about to attack
the motorcade

33:14.729 --> 33:15.997
for the treaty signing.

33:16.147 --> 33:18.067
- What are you talking about?
- She's the problem

33:18.091 --> 33:19.250
in McQuaid Security.

33:19.368 --> 33:21.869
She put a bomb on one
of the motorcade vehicles.

33:21.987 --> 33:25.506
- How do you know this?
- People are gonna die.

33:25.624 --> 33:28.042
If I'm wrong, you can arrest me,
but I'm not.

33:28.176 --> 33:31.596
So shoot me
or let me go.

33:34.700 --> 33:36.217
Okay, I'm gonna drive you.

33:36.351 --> 33:38.019
I can get us through
the security blocks.

33:38.169 --> 33:40.187
I'll call it in.

33:58.707 --> 33:59.874
We're all good.

34:17.976 --> 34:19.643
Why have we stopped?

34:31.056 --> 34:33.491
10-89! Check the car!

34:35.911 --> 34:37.951
Get these people out
of the cars and move them back.

34:37.975 --> 34:38.779
Check each car.

34:38.914 --> 34:39.514
We have an explosive device.

34:39.538 --> 34:40.706
Get out! Move.

34:40.706 --> 34:42.016
I found it. It's here.

34:42.016 --> 34:44.550
Everybody out now.
Everyone out now.

34:44.652 --> 34:46.453
Clear the area.

34:46.588 --> 34:48.789
Get people out of the cars
and move them back.

34:48.956 --> 34:49.790
Step out of the car,
please, sir.

34:49.924 --> 34:52.759
They found it.

34:52.893 --> 34:55.012
Clear the area.
Everybody out.

35:19.704 --> 35:21.204
Drive.

35:44.716 --> 35:46.484
Are you okay?

35:46.568 --> 35:47.685
I don't know.

35:47.853 --> 35:51.155
That woman,
she killed the driver.

35:51.240 --> 35:52.857
Did you see which way
she went?

35:53.025 --> 35:54.859
Down the alley.

36:38.603 --> 36:40.404
Aah!

36:42.157 --> 36:43.908
You'll never stop us!

36:48.780 --> 36:50.998
Alek.

36:53.502 --> 36:55.052
Drop the gun!

36:55.170 --> 36:56.420
Put it down.

36:57.538 --> 36:59.756
Step back.

37:41.920 --> 37:42.912
What's going on?

37:42.913 --> 37:45.334
Well, his version of events
is very different than yours.

37:45.335 --> 37:47.169
Yeah, I bet it is.

37:47.253 --> 37:48.971
He's not denying
he shot Caitlyn, is he?

37:49.089 --> 37:51.557
No, but he claims he did it
to save your life.

37:51.707 --> 37:54.476
He did it to save himself.

37:54.561 --> 37:57.479
He didn't shoot
until she used the word "us."

37:57.597 --> 38:00.899
He and Caitlyn
are working together.

38:01.050 --> 38:04.019
The way she said his name
after he shot her...

38:05.438 --> 38:07.439
She felt betrayed.

38:07.574 --> 38:08.991
Well, it's your word
against his.

38:09.109 --> 38:10.909
I believe you,

38:11.061 --> 38:13.362
but he's a diplomat. He's
entitled to certain privileges.

38:13.496 --> 38:15.247
They have to surrender him
to his embassy.

38:15.398 --> 38:17.783
He is gonna be on a plane
to Georgia in an hour.

38:17.917 --> 38:20.452
We can't let him get away with
this. They're working together.

38:20.587 --> 38:22.227
He just tried to bomb the car
you were in.

38:22.255 --> 38:23.288
Hey.

38:23.423 --> 38:25.424
I understand
you're frustrated.

38:25.575 --> 38:27.292
But picking a fight
with State

38:27.410 --> 38:28.794
is only gonna accomplish
one thing.

38:28.911 --> 38:31.346
It's gonna get yourself
locked up instead of Belenko.

38:31.464 --> 38:33.549
Excuse me.

38:33.716 --> 38:35.434
Yeah.

38:45.761 --> 38:47.312
All right.

38:54.320 --> 38:57.322
I can't do nothing.

38:57.457 --> 38:59.408
McQuaid's been shot.

39:26.319 --> 39:28.353
I thought I told you
to leave me alone.

39:28.488 --> 39:31.273
I need your help.

39:43.002 --> 39:43.869
Auggie.

39:43.986 --> 39:46.288
- Yeah.
- Hey.

39:46.422 --> 39:49.541
I just came to say good-bye.

39:49.676 --> 39:51.356
There's still a lot of Intel
to go through.

39:51.377 --> 39:53.512
NCTC can't be packing it in
just yet.

39:53.663 --> 39:56.298
Yeah, they're not.
I am.

39:56.382 --> 39:58.100
They asked me to head up

39:58.218 --> 40:00.519
a new
joint operations center.

40:02.188 --> 40:05.641
I also wanted to say
that I was wrong about Annie,

40:05.775 --> 40:07.860
and I'm sorry.

40:08.010 --> 40:10.896
Thanks for believing her.

40:17.853 --> 40:20.122
Truce?

40:20.206 --> 40:21.406
Truce.

40:24.661 --> 40:25.744
Good-bye.

40:25.879 --> 40:28.213
Bye.

41:14.093 --> 41:16.211
U.S. generals.

41:16.379 --> 41:18.347
Aleksandre Belenko,
the Georgian diplomat

41:18.464 --> 41:19.765
who organized the treaty,

41:19.882 --> 41:21.516
has issued a statement.

41:21.634 --> 41:23.154
He implores anyone
with any information

41:23.252 --> 41:26.221
about the still unknown
assailants to come forward.

41:26.356 --> 41:29.641
Meantime,
as a safety precaution,

41:29.776 --> 41:32.477
Belenko has been recalled
to his home country

41:32.612 --> 41:35.480
where he made the following
statement about the attack.

41:35.615 --> 41:38.066
The true travesty
of this attack

41:38.234 --> 41:41.069
is that it has since come
to overshadow the treaty

41:41.237 --> 41:44.740
whose purpose was to prevent
exactly this type of violence.

41:44.874 --> 41:46.875
That is all I have to say.
Thank you.

41:50.964 --> 41:53.465
It's me. Everything moves
forward as discussed,

41:53.583 --> 41:55.500
but Caitlyn is no longer
available to us.

41:55.635 --> 41:59.254
It doesn't matter.
I need you in Istanbul tomorrow.

41:59.389 --> 42:01.673
We missed the target
yesterday,

42:01.791 --> 42:03.809
so I need to accelerate
the timetable.

42:03.959 --> 42:06.845
The CIA are getting
too close.

42:06.980 --> 42:09.848
I have every intention
of finishing what I started.
