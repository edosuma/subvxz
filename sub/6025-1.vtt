WEBVTT

00:23.440 --> 00:24.441
<i>Whoo!</i>

00:24.520 --> 00:25.521
<i>Yeah!</i>

00:25.600 --> 00:28.888
<i>Somebody make
some motherfucking noise in here!</i>

00:31.960 --> 00:33.610
<i>Fuck these people.</i>

00:37.720 --> 00:40.007
Man, this place is unbelievable.

00:40.480 --> 00:41.970
Fucking Goolybib, man.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.849
Those guys build
a mediocre piece of software,

00:43.920 --> 00:47.003
that might be worth something someday,
and now they live here.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.681
There's money flying all over Silicon
Valley but none of it ever seems to hit us.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.409
What the hell are you eating?

00:53.480 --> 00:55.926
Liquid shrimp. It's 200 dollars a quart.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.765
Wylie Dufresne made it.

00:58.280 --> 00:59.645
How does it taste?

01:00.240 --> 01:02.481
Like how I would imagine cum tastes.

01:03.520 --> 01:05.409
You guys taking it all in?

01:05.480 --> 01:07.369
Because this is what it looks like

01:07.440 --> 01:10.922
when Google acquires your company
for over 200 million dollars.

01:11.240 --> 01:12.969
Look, Dustin Moskovitz.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.762
Elon Musk, Eric Schmidt.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.411
Whatever the fuck the guy's name
is who created Photrio.

01:18.560 --> 01:21.484
I mean, Kid Rock is the
poorest person here.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.331
Apart from you guys.

01:23.400 --> 01:27.928
Okay, there's 40 billion dollars
of net worth walking around this party.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.082
And you guys are standing
around drinking shrimp

01:30.160 --> 01:32.083
and talking about what cum tastes like.

01:32.160 --> 01:35.482
Yeah, I heard that.
You guys live in my incubator.

01:35.560 --> 01:38.166
You've got to network.
That's why I brought you here.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.044
Uh, I got us in here.

01:40.160 --> 01:42.401
Javeed over there is my ex-room-mate.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.727
Yeah, but I drove.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.328
Eric Schmidt, Erlich Bachman.

01:49.720 --> 01:51.688
It's amazing how the men
and women at these things

01:51.760 --> 01:53.285
always separate like this.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.807
Yeah, every party in Silicon Valley
ends up like a Hasidic wedding.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.726
Not even the Goolybib guys
were talking to girls.

01:59.800 --> 02:01.370
They don't have to, Big Head.

02:01.440 --> 02:03.204
This house talks to girls.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.489
<i>Hello! Whoo!</i>

02:09.680 --> 02:11.569
<i>I got seven words for you.</i>

02:12.800 --> 02:14.848
<i>I love</i>

02:14.920 --> 02:19.562
<i>Goolybib's
integrated-multi-platform-functionality!</i>

02:19.640 --> 02:20.766
<i>Yeah!</i>

02:20.840 --> 02:21.841
- All right!
- Whoo!

02:22.720 --> 02:23.721
Yeah!

02:23.800 --> 02:25.564
<i>But seriously,</i>

02:26.360 --> 02:29.489
<i>you know, a few days ago, when we
were sitting down with Barack Obama,</i>

02:29.720 --> 02:31.210
<i>I turned to these guys and said,</i>

02:31.280 --> 02:34.090
<i>"Okay, you know, we're making
a lot of money."</i>

02:34.160 --> 02:37.004
<i>"And yes, we're disrupting digital media."</i>

02:37.440 --> 02:39.283
<i>"But most importantly,"</i>

02:40.400 --> 02:42.004
<i>"we're making the world a better place."</i>

02:43.280 --> 02:47.763
<i>"Through constructing elegant hierarchies
for maximum code reuse and extensibility."</i>

02:49.280 --> 02:50.770
So, everyone.

02:51.960 --> 02:54.770
<i>Here's to many more nights
just like this one.</i>

02:55.960 --> 02:59.760
<i>Take it away, my good friend, Kid Rock.</i>

03:00.560 --> 03:01.721
What a dick.

03:14.760 --> 03:18.810
Big Head, there is a personal ad section
on this Asperger site.

03:19.120 --> 03:20.610
Holy shit, this one is looking for

03:20.720 --> 03:23.724
a "relationship that has the potential
to become sexual in nature."

03:24.120 --> 03:25.451
Boy, is she on the spectrum.

03:25.760 --> 03:28.286
She can't even make eye contact
with the camera.

03:28.360 --> 03:30.010
Richard, can I talk to you for a second?

03:30.280 --> 03:31.645
- Solo.
- Mmm-hmm.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.888
We need to talk about Pied Piper.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.726
What about it? The
website's up and running,

03:40.800 --> 03:43.280
I'm just redesigning the compression.
It just needs users.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.169
Yeah, no shit.

03:45.240 --> 03:46.924
But even if somebody wanted to use it,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.731
they wouldn't be able to figure out how to.
It's incomprehensible.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.482
Now, Richard,
when you pitched me Pied Piper

03:52.560 --> 03:54.483
you said it was gonna be,
"The Google of Music."

03:54.560 --> 03:56.449
Which is a really rad
way to pitch something.

03:56.520 --> 03:58.887
I mean, I liked it.
I thought it had applications.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.928
No, it has all that.
Look, when it blows up,

04:01.000 --> 04:03.571
and it will once it reaches
a critical mass of users,

04:03.680 --> 04:06.445
Pied Piper will be able to search
the whole world of recorded music

04:06.520 --> 04:10.320
to find out if there's a match to see if
you're infringing on any copyrighted material.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.961
So, if you're a songwriter or a band...

04:12.000 --> 04:15.322
Okay, first of all, nobody gives a shit
about stealing other people's music, okay?

04:15.600 --> 04:18.683
Everybody involved in the music industry
is either stealing it or sharing it.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.966
They're all a bunch of assholes,
especially Radiohead.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.321
- Look, Richard...
- No.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.209
Yeah, they're assholes.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.567
Now, look, Richard, if
you want to live here,

04:26.720 --> 04:28.085
- you've got to deliver.
- Mmm.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.610
I can't have dead weight
at my incubator, okay?

04:31.680 --> 04:34.843
Either that, or show some promise,
for fuck's sake.

04:34.960 --> 04:37.042
Like NipAlert, Big Head's app.

04:37.200 --> 04:40.204
It gives you the location
of a woman with erect nipples.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.691
Now, that's something people want.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.962
Richard, you need to get
in touch with humanity.

04:44.440 --> 04:45.885
When I sold my company, Aviato,

04:46.360 --> 04:47.486
I wanted to give back.

04:47.560 --> 04:51.645
That's why I started this place,
to do something big. To make a difference.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.563
You know, like Steve.

04:53.720 --> 04:54.721
Um...

04:55.040 --> 04:56.201
Jobs or Wozniak?

04:58.600 --> 04:59.681
Uh, Steve Jobs or Steve...

04:59.760 --> 05:01.171
Oh, I heard you.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.043
- Which one?
- Jobs.

05:04.920 --> 05:08.447
I mean, Jobs was a poser.
He didn't even write code.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.729
You just disappeared up your own asshole.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.247
- You know that? You did.
- Well, technically...

05:15.760 --> 05:17.285
Big Head, I'm gonna be meditating.

05:17.360 --> 05:21.081
He knew how to package the ideas,
but it was Wozniak that...

05:24.920 --> 05:27.571
<i>What is Hooli? Excellent question.</i>

05:27.920 --> 05:30.241
<i>Hooli isn't just another high tech company.</i>

05:30.440 --> 05:32.408
<i>Hooli isn't just about software.</i>

05:32.800 --> 05:35.201
<i>Hooli... Hooli is about people.</i>

05:36.080 --> 05:40.005
<i>Hooli is about innovative technology
that makes a difference,</i>

05:40.200 --> 05:42.521
<i>transforming the world as we know it.</i>

05:42.600 --> 05:45.080
<i>Making the world a better place,</i>

05:45.680 --> 05:47.887
<i>through minimal message
oriented transport layers.</i>

05:48.280 --> 05:51.602
<i>I firmly believe we can
only achieve greatness</i>

05:51.680 --> 05:54.524
<i>if first we achieve goodness.</i>

05:57.120 --> 05:59.009
Erlich is gonna kick me out.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.730
And I can't afford to pay rent here.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.128
It's insane. $2800 a month,

06:03.480 --> 06:05.801
$4500 a month, with five people.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.122
Jesus! Why is it so expensive here?

06:08.600 --> 06:11.171
Look at this place, it's a shithole.

06:12.760 --> 06:13.761
Uh-oh.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.001
Here's another one.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.760
Miss Palo Alto, 2K14.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.285
There she goes.

06:22.600 --> 06:26.127
Oh, God, the marketing team
is having another bike meeting.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.486
Douchebags.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.083
Just another day inside the
Gavin Belson cult compound.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.882
Hey, did you hear
what Peter Gregory is doing?

06:34.960 --> 06:36.564
You mean buying that island in the Pacific?

06:36.640 --> 06:38.529
No, he's building one actually.

06:38.840 --> 06:39.841
Baller.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.088
Anyway, he's also offering 100K

06:42.160 --> 06:45.403
to people willing to skip or drop out
of college to pursue their idea.

06:45.640 --> 06:49.326
I don't know what happened to that guy,
but he really hates college.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.887
Anyway, he's doing a TED Talks
in Palo Alto tonight.

06:51.960 --> 06:54.440
- Should we try to get in?
- I dropped out of college.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.569
Maybe I should re-enroll
and drop out again.

06:56.680 --> 06:57.966
Try and get the money.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.641
<i>Brogrammers.</i>

07:05.720 --> 07:08.087
Oh, no, no.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.242
Hey, a double macchiato for me, dude.

07:10.320 --> 07:11.446
Yeah.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.491
Hey, Rico, you been working out?

07:15.680 --> 07:17.409
No. No, I have not.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.448
I don't have time to even if I wanted to.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.249
I'm too busy working on my website.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.921
Uh, I just, I don't want to end up
being a Hooli lifer.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.321
You know, working here forever.

07:26.520 --> 07:30.605
Yeah, working for the most
innovative company in the world,

07:30.720 --> 07:33.690
with top pay and vested stock options.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.728
I can totally see why
you wouldn't want that.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.280
Yeah, you're like an artist.
An entrepreneur.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.044
An iconoclast.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.684
I don't know, maybe.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.843
Dude, we're just messing with you.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.324
But we really want to help you
with your site. What's it called?

07:51.560 --> 07:52.766
Pied Piper.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.569
- Dude, sounds amazing.
- Yeah.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.608
Why don't you shoot it over to us
and we'll give it a look.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.080
Maybe we can help.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.050
- Uh, really?
- Yeah.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.520
Okay, yeah...

08:02.600 --> 08:05.206
I mean it's always good
to have more eyes on it.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.525
Look, it's sending... Sent it.

08:13.800 --> 08:17.122
Oh. You're making fun of me.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.168
- Dude, no.
- No, you are.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.288
- No, Ricky, man.
- Ricky. Ricky, come back.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.044
It's actually Richard, so that's...

08:23.440 --> 08:24.840
- Pied wiper.
- Wide diaper.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.526
Gates, Ellison,

08:31.640 --> 08:34.450
Jobs, Dell...

08:36.320 --> 08:39.369
All dropped out of college.

08:40.480 --> 08:43.323
Silicon Valley is the cradle of innovation

08:43.400 --> 08:45.289
because of drop outs.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.126
College

08:48.040 --> 08:51.601
has become a cruel, expensive joke

08:52.400 --> 08:55.290
on the poor and the middle class

08:56.880 --> 08:59.645
that benefits only the perpetrators of it.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.404
The bloated administrators.

09:02.520 --> 09:05.967
You are a dangerous man,
spewing ignorance!

09:07.000 --> 09:08.684
I don't think so.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.686
I'm just saying people
should trust themselves

09:11.800 --> 09:15.885
more than a system that happily churns out
unemployed debtors

09:15.960 --> 09:18.327
and provides dubious value.

09:18.400 --> 09:22.530
The true value of a college education
is intangible.

09:23.200 --> 09:26.409
The true value of snake-oil
is intangible as well.

09:28.680 --> 09:30.011
Fascist.

09:33.320 --> 09:34.845
- Anything?
- Eh.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.849
The usual riffs on Twitter and lnstagram.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.570
Nothing I'd fund.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.488
Hi, excuse me, Mr. Gregory? Um...

09:42.720 --> 09:44.881
I have an idea I'd love to pitch you,
if you have time.

09:44.960 --> 09:45.961
Ooh.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.447
Uh...

09:48.080 --> 09:51.129
Well, that is before I just give up
and go back to college.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.441
Don't... Do not do that.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.249
Go work at Burger King.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.448
Go into the woods and forage
for nuts and berries.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.568
Do not go back to college!

10:02.720 --> 10:04.245
I think I have been played.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.009
Fine. Go ahead and pitch.

10:07.080 --> 10:09.287
You have until I fasten
the seatbelt in my car.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.044
Thank you so much. Uh...

10:11.320 --> 10:13.891
Pied Piper is a proprietary site
that lets you find out

10:13.960 --> 10:16.804
if your music is infringing
on any existing copyrights.

10:16.880 --> 10:19.724
So, imagine you were a songwriter, okay?

10:19.880 --> 10:21.962
I don't think I could write a song.

10:22.680 --> 10:24.808
Yeah, no, just imagine if you were.

10:24.880 --> 10:28.202
I don't even think I could say,
"Pied Piper is a proprietary site."

10:29.080 --> 10:31.287
Well, I just did but it wasn't easy.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.323
Crunching all those songs to find matches

10:34.400 --> 10:37.370
sounds like it would take
incredible processing power.

10:37.440 --> 10:38.965
- I mean...
- Yes.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.724
Yes, it does.

10:41.160 --> 10:45.051
No, no. It's... I made an algorithm.

10:45.280 --> 10:49.888
Look, why don't you send me a link to
your project and we'll take a look.

10:50.560 --> 10:51.561
Okay, yeah, great.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.570
I put the prototype up on Github.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.528
Pied Piper. I'll look it up.

10:56.600 --> 11:02.528
It's like the fable with the kids
and then the rats and the music.

11:11.240 --> 11:13.083
That is a narrow car.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.969
Fucking billionaires.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.090
Hey, wanna check out twig-boy's website?

11:21.280 --> 11:22.964
Yes, I do.

11:26.280 --> 11:29.124
You have to download
your own media player?

11:29.600 --> 11:32.968
Oh. Look at me, I traveled back to 2009.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.611
Wait a sec.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.802
What is this file size?

11:40.360 --> 11:42.442
1.2 megabytes? No way.

11:43.640 --> 11:46.405
Wow, that doesn't sound at all downgraded.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.370
The file size is like, half.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.842
And look how fast this search is.

11:54.720 --> 11:57.929
Holy shit, how did it
find a match that fast?

11:59.000 --> 12:02.083
It's like it's searching compressed files?

12:03.120 --> 12:04.770
No way.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.481
Look at that Weissman score.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.011
2.89.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.367
Hey, where have you two been?

12:14.440 --> 12:16.800
We're playing the multi-channel router team
in five minutes.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.889
Okay, how the hell did he do this?

12:19.320 --> 12:21.641
And the compression is totally lossless.

12:26.240 --> 12:30.404
And he's somehow figured out a way
to do a search on a compressed data space.

12:32.640 --> 12:33.971
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.929
And I don't think he even realizes
what he has here.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.162
He's using it for some
silly songwriter app.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.920
All these guys are like that,
they're all about consumer facing.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.689
Right, but you take something like this,

12:42.760 --> 12:45.286
make it business facing
and use it for enterprise,

12:45.360 --> 12:47.567
the applications could be endless.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.521
Hey, Gilfoyle, I thought
you were a Satanist?

12:52.720 --> 12:55.041
I'm a LaVeyan Satanist

12:55.200 --> 12:56.725
with some theistic tendencies.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.290
Oh, some theistic tendencies.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.691
Well then, what's with the cross?

13:00.440 --> 13:01.885
It's an upside down cross.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.048
Not from here it isn't.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.522
Oh, I see, you know what you should do?

13:09.640 --> 13:12.450
You should get another tattoo
that says, "This side up" on it.

13:12.640 --> 13:14.130
How does this translate into Farsi?

13:14.200 --> 13:15.770
That's not the language I speak.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.561
Frontier Airlines just happened
to like mine, Aviato.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.884
And that's how I got to where I am.

13:22.120 --> 13:24.248
So, what do you got?

13:25.000 --> 13:27.207
Okay, here it is.

13:27.760 --> 13:29.410
Bit Soup.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.201
It's like alphabet soup,

13:32.720 --> 13:36.406
but it's ones and zeros,
instead of the letters.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.165
'Cause it's binary.
You know, binary is just ones and zeroes.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.765
Yeah, I know what binary is.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.207
Jesus Christ!
I memorized the hexadecimal times tables

13:46.280 --> 13:48.362
when I was 14 writing machine code!

13:48.440 --> 13:50.442
Okay? Ask me what nine times F is.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.205
It's fleventyfive.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.641
I do not need you telling
me what binary is,

13:54.720 --> 13:58.327
just like I don't need you thinking
about soup or taking pictures of it.

13:58.440 --> 14:01.250
I need you thinking about
apps, software, websites.

14:01.360 --> 14:04.125
This is Silicon Valley, all right, not...

14:07.200 --> 14:08.770
Paris, Texas.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.401
Hmm.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.369
That's where Campbell's Soup is.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.204
It's the Hooli number again.

14:18.320 --> 14:19.526
It's probably those brogrammers.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.762
Can't wait to tell me how
stupid my website is.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.047
Assholes.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.522
Hello, Richard Hendricks.
I'm a total fucking retard.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.691
Uh, hi, this is Jared
Dunn calling from Hooli.

14:32.160 --> 14:34.322
I'm calling on behalf of Gavin Belson.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.843
I didn't... Hi.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.729
Gavin is very excited
about your Pied Piper application

14:40.800 --> 14:44.486
and we were wondering if you could come in
for a sit-down with us.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.564
<i>- Are you available now?
- Okay.</i>

14:46.640 --> 14:47.761
<i>- Sure.
- Okay, we'll be here.</i>

14:47.800 --> 14:49.723
Yes. Good-bye.

14:50.480 --> 14:51.481
Uh...

14:51.800 --> 14:53.529
I have a meeting with Gavin Belson.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.251
He likes Pied Piper.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.890
- Holy shit.
- I own 10% of Pied Piper.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.411
You said it was a shitty idea.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.845
It was a shitty idea.

15:00.480 --> 15:01.970
I'm not sure what it is now.

15:02.120 --> 15:04.282
- What time's the meeting?
- Right now.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.891
I'm gonna need a better shirt.

15:08.600 --> 15:09.886
Holy shit.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.088
- What the fuck am I waiting for?
- Uh, see ya.

15:24.040 --> 15:28.125
Well, it's like Gavin always says,
"it takes change to make change."

15:28.560 --> 15:31.530
Uh, yeah, I think I've
seen that written around.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.601
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:34.440 --> 15:36.442
Gavin is running 30 minutes late

15:36.520 --> 15:40.002
but you should know,
he is very excited to see you, Richard.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.081
Oh.

15:41.160 --> 15:42.650
He's with his spiritual advisor.

15:42.720 --> 15:43.960
He shouldn't be that much longer.

15:44.040 --> 15:47.601
I'm a VP here and I only get to see him
about 10 minutes a month.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.763
Yeah, but that 10 minutes
is just incredible.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.526
I heard Richard Hendricks was here.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.809
Have you ever met Gavin before?

15:56.880 --> 15:58.325
- No.
- No?

15:58.440 --> 16:01.046
Oh, I told him, it's amazing.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.840
That hardly begins to describe it.

16:07.120 --> 16:08.681
It's weird.

16:09.320 --> 16:11.687
They always travel in groups of five.

16:11.760 --> 16:15.446
These programmers, there's
always a tall skinny white guy,

16:15.520 --> 16:17.443
short skinny Asian guy,

16:17.600 --> 16:19.045
fat guy with a ponytail,

16:19.200 --> 16:21.009
some guy with crazy facial hair

16:21.080 --> 16:23.765
and then an East Indian guy.

16:24.360 --> 16:28.251
It's like they trade guys
until they all have the right group.

16:29.120 --> 16:32.920
You clearly have a great
understanding of humanity.

16:35.360 --> 16:39.285
And Gavin said, "I'm not humiliating you,
I'm elevating you."

16:39.360 --> 16:40.930
Oh, Gavin...

16:48.240 --> 16:49.844
This is Richard.

16:50.880 --> 16:52.086
It's Peter Gregory.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.081
Uh...

16:55.320 --> 16:56.401
No.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.087
Come on, Big Head.

16:59.160 --> 17:00.685
Yeah, I'm coming. Slow...

17:00.880 --> 17:02.211
Why are you going that fast?

17:02.560 --> 17:04.319
'Cause we've got a meeting
with Gavin Belson.

17:04.359 --> 17:05.361
Pick up the pace.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.640
- We honestly don't.
- Come on.

17:14.119 --> 17:17.567
I'm actually outside of Gavin Belson's
office right now, Mr. Gregory.

17:17.800 --> 17:21.202
Uh, here he comes, so can I call you back
in a second?

17:21.280 --> 17:23.851
So, Richard Hendricks is here!

17:26.680 --> 17:28.090
- There you are, Richard.
- Hi.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.560
So sorry these gentleman
have kept you waiting.

17:31.640 --> 17:33.080
- That's fine.
- So here's the thing.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.248
I love what you did.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.440
- Really?
- Fill him in, Jared.

17:37.520 --> 17:42.321
Now, as you know, Hooli is seen as possibly
the most progressive company in the world.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.007
Part of that is Gavin's
commitment to social justice,

17:45.640 --> 17:49.611
but part of it is his personal commitment
to the people that work at Hooli.

17:49.680 --> 17:53.082
In that spirit Gavin is prepared to
give you a very substantial raise,

17:53.160 --> 17:54.525
and a promotion to go with it.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.569
I own 10 percent.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.768
He created it while living in my incubator.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.691
Erlich Bachman. This is Big Head.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.326
I don't know what any of that means,

18:03.400 --> 18:06.244
but I'll give you 600
thousand dollars for it.

18:06.320 --> 18:09.324
We have the reach and the resources
to take what you have done

18:09.440 --> 18:11.966
and push it to the global level.

18:12.040 --> 18:15.089
That is a generous offer. I, um...

18:15.400 --> 18:17.801
Shit, sorry. Hello.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.604
Really? No shit, that's...

18:21.320 --> 18:24.927
Uh, yeah, yeah. No, here.
It's Peter Gregory.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.050
Not sure how he got my number.

18:27.840 --> 18:28.921
Uh, this is Richard.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.082
I'll give you $3 million for it
right now!

18:32.520 --> 18:33.521
Uh...

18:33.600 --> 18:36.888
Gavin Belson just offered me
$3 million for Pied Piper.

18:37.240 --> 18:40.289
I'm prepared to give you $300,000.

18:40.880 --> 18:44.202
Peter Gregory just offered me 300...

18:44.800 --> 18:46.723
Did you say thousand dollars?

18:46.920 --> 18:48.365
For 10% of your company.

18:48.680 --> 18:49.841
Okay, 4 million.

18:51.280 --> 18:52.770
200,000.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.045
- For 5%.
- Huh?

18:55.720 --> 18:57.563
You just went down.

18:57.800 --> 19:01.327
No, you're still valued
at four million dollars.

19:01.400 --> 19:05.724
But you own 95%
of a potential billion-dollar company.

19:06.080 --> 19:09.402
<i>And not just that,
I will help you build this company.</i>

19:09.680 --> 19:12.001
I will introduce you
to the people you need to know

19:12.080 --> 19:14.401
and provide the counsel that you need.

19:14.560 --> 19:17.928
I will take a small piece,
but the company will belong to you.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.481
<i>Not Gavin Belson.</i>

19:22.360 --> 19:24.408
<i>You have until tomorrow to decide.</i>

19:24.760 --> 19:25.761
Uh...

19:25.840 --> 19:27.080
Okay.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.361
- Um, you know...
- Pull your head out of your ass, Richard.

19:30.760 --> 19:33.889
I'm offering you
$4 million right now.

19:33.960 --> 19:35.007
Mmm...

19:35.760 --> 19:36.761
I'm...

19:38.080 --> 19:39.605
That is a lot of money.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.050
You know, I actually have to...

19:45.160 --> 19:47.208
I've got to go to the bathroom.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.281
I've got to pee.

19:48.360 --> 19:50.727
It's desperate. I'm bursting.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.049
I'll be right back, but right now...

19:53.120 --> 19:54.281
Okay, 10 million.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.681
No. Maybe.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.200
I didn't mean to snap at you.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.123
I'll talk in a bit.

20:01.120 --> 20:02.690
Won't be long.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.006
Little more about me.

20:10.080 --> 20:14.210
I am the founder of Aviato, and I own
a very small percentage of Grindr.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.965
It's a men to men dating site

20:17.040 --> 20:19.168
where you can find other men
within 10 miles of you

20:19.280 --> 20:21.965
interested in having sexual intercourse
in a public restroom.

20:22.480 --> 20:25.245
In the homosexual community
there's sometimes anonymous...

20:25.320 --> 20:26.560
I know what Grindr is.

20:26.640 --> 20:27.971
I have gay friends.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.684
So you will survive.

20:40.800 --> 20:43.280
It's just a garden variety panic attack.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.930
Welcome to Silicon Valley.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.809
We see people like you all the time.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.531
- Really?
- Yes.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.921
It's just I have to make
this decision by tomorrow.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.490
Yeah. You know, a while back,

20:52.560 --> 20:54.767
we had a guy in here
in almost the exact same situation,

20:54.840 --> 20:56.320
"Take the money or keep the company."

20:57.600 --> 20:58.681
What happened?

20:58.760 --> 21:01.445
Well, a couple months later,

21:01.520 --> 21:04.808
he was brought into the ER
with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.848
I guess he really regretted
not taking that money.

21:07.640 --> 21:09.961
He shot himself because
he turned down the money?

21:10.080 --> 21:11.605
Yeah.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.689
Or no, he took the money.

21:14.120 --> 21:15.326
Or no.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.325
No, he did not. I don't... You know what?

21:17.400 --> 21:19.050
I don't remember. But whatever it was,

21:19.120 --> 21:20.963
he regretted it so much
that he ended up shooting himself.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.088
- And now he's blind.
- He's blind?

21:23.160 --> 21:25.003
Yeah, just FYI,
if you're ever gonna shoot yourself,

21:25.080 --> 21:26.491
don't hold the gun up to your temple, okay?

21:26.560 --> 21:29.291
Because that just basically took out
both of his optic nerves and then,

21:29.360 --> 21:30.850
you know, half of his face.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.968
And then his wife left him,
because, you know...

21:33.680 --> 21:35.125
- Yikes.
- Right.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.250
He may have been a genius programmer

21:37.320 --> 21:39.891
but not so much
in human anatomy.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.564
Or decision making, for that matter.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.561
Now he's got to live with all that

21:43.600 --> 21:46.490
and whatever terrible decision
he made about the money.

21:46.680 --> 21:51.402
Uh, and what do I do if I feel
another panic attack coming on?

21:51.680 --> 21:54.923
Mmm. Would you be interested in a device

21:55.040 --> 21:58.522
that links up to your smartphone
and it keeps track of your vitals

21:58.600 --> 22:00.284
and it tells you, even
before it's happening,

22:00.360 --> 22:03.011
whether you're having a panic attack
or an actual heart attack?

22:03.920 --> 22:05.285
Yeah, that sounds great.

22:05.360 --> 22:08.569
You would, right? Okay, that's great news.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.762
Because it's still in prototype phase
right now,

22:10.840 --> 22:12.683
but my start-up partners
and I are looking for investors.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.888
Like today. So will you
please let me know...

22:14.960 --> 22:15.961
I'm going to give you my number.

22:16.040 --> 22:17.963
If you do end up taking
that 10 million dollars

22:18.040 --> 22:21.726
because we could really
make the world a better place.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.365
Whoa!

22:23.600 --> 22:24.601
Oh, jeez!

22:31.520 --> 22:32.806
Richard.

22:32.880 --> 22:35.724
Hi, Monica. I work with Peter Gregory.

22:35.800 --> 22:38.041
- We met outside the TED...
- Yeah, I remember you.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.964
What... How'd you know I was here?

22:42.120 --> 22:46.045
Peter Gregory is invested in a company
that uses GPS in phones to track people.

22:46.920 --> 22:47.967
That's creepy.

22:48.280 --> 22:49.964
You don't know the half of it.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.804
And neither does Congress.

22:53.520 --> 22:56.888
- Are you okay?
- Look, I don't want to waste your time.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.725
I think I gotta take
the money from Gavin Belson.

22:59.800 --> 23:03.805
At least this way when I blow my eyeballs out
I'll have some money left for my family.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.161
Jesus.

23:06.400 --> 23:10.485
Sorry. That is a terrible doctor in there.

23:10.640 --> 23:14.087
Richard, buried in that clunky UI of yours

23:14.160 --> 23:18.085
is a compression algorithm
that blew our engineering team away.

23:18.520 --> 23:20.520
And what do you think Hooli
is going to do with it?

23:20.800 --> 23:22.723
I don't know. That's their business.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.086
This is your baby.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.924
Do you even realize the impact

23:26.000 --> 23:28.651
that a compression this good
could have on the world?

23:28.760 --> 23:31.047
Getting any file on your mobile phone
in an instant.

23:31.480 --> 23:35.610
Navigation data for self-driving cars,
mobile medical imagery,

23:35.680 --> 23:38.286
all transmitting with no quality loss.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.929
This is game-changing.

23:42.320 --> 23:45.051
And don't you want to be
in the driver's seat when that happens?

23:45.120 --> 23:48.567
You really want to just
turn it all over to Hooli and walk away?

23:50.720 --> 23:53.041
Well, you are not making
this easier for me.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.205
I'm not trying to.

23:55.360 --> 23:56.805
I mean, you're actually making it worse.

23:56.880 --> 23:59.406
My hands are tingling.
I have this metal taste in my mouth.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.562
Actually, I can't go back in there,
so I'm going to go home.

24:01.640 --> 24:04.041
- Let me give you a ride home.
- Good to see you again.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.690
Uh, okay. Thanks.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.640
Dude, where have you been?

24:10.760 --> 24:12.125
Why won't you answer your phone?

24:12.200 --> 24:14.123
Man, this has grown
way beyond AngelList, man.

24:14.200 --> 24:17.443
Andreesen, Elevation and like a bunch of
other seed firms are piling onto this thing.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.000
I mean, they've been calling Erlich.

24:19.360 --> 24:20.850
He's out of control.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.121
Yeah.

24:23.520 --> 24:27.730
What if we took Peter Gregory's 200K
and built our own company?

24:27.920 --> 24:29.160
I'm sorry. You said "we."

24:29.800 --> 24:31.370
Who's that in reference to exactly?

24:32.000 --> 24:34.367
You, me, Dinesh, Big Head, us.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.441
I mean, right now Pied
Piper just does audio,

24:36.480 --> 24:39.450
but I'm thinking of ways
to compress images, video...

24:39.720 --> 24:42.401
I mean, maybe Peter Gregory's right.
Maybe this thing could be huge.

24:42.720 --> 24:44.802
Look, guys, for thousands of years

24:44.920 --> 24:47.446
guys like us
have gotten the shit kicked out of us.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.364
But now, for the first time,
we are living in an era

24:50.440 --> 24:53.284
where we can be in charge
and build empires.

24:53.560 --> 24:56.086
We could be the Vikings of our day.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.489
- Vikings?
- How are you feeling?

24:59.600 --> 25:02.251
You look super fucked up, to be honest.

25:02.840 --> 25:05.764
Who ate my fucking quinoa again?

25:05.960 --> 25:09.601
So you're really about to go tell Erlich
that he's not going to get his $1 million?

25:09.800 --> 25:11.768
Yeah, I don't want to be there
when you do that.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.365
I would like to be there when you do that.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.568
No, just stay here, please.

25:18.520 --> 25:19.601
Hey-

25:22.920 --> 25:23.921
Um...

25:24.120 --> 25:29.286
So, I've been thinking about this whole
Peter Gregory, Gavin Belson thing.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.847
And, um, I think I'm going
to go with Peter Gregory.

25:34.960 --> 25:37.566
- Uh, which I know means...
- Richard.

25:38.480 --> 25:42.804
I know that you look at me,
and see a guy who has it all figured out.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.487
And for the most part, you're right, I do.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.650
When I sold Aviato,

25:47.720 --> 25:51.361
it gave me a house, money, fancy clothes,

25:51.440 --> 25:53.522
the universal respect of all the ladies.

25:54.280 --> 25:57.124
But there's always been a hole in my heart.

25:57.440 --> 26:02.082
Not a literal hole like you would find
in some babies with congenital diseases,

26:02.160 --> 26:04.083
but a metaphorical hole.

26:04.640 --> 26:06.483
I guess that hole is the "What if."

26:07.000 --> 26:08.331
What if I didn't sell?

26:09.440 --> 26:10.805
I'll never know.

26:11.640 --> 26:13.802
And so I guess what I'm
saying to you now is,

26:14.440 --> 26:16.010
you're like me, Richard.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.250
You want to build something

26:18.320 --> 26:20.084
and see it through.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.321
Uh, so, just to be clear.

26:23.400 --> 26:27.530
You're all right with me saying no to a deal
that will net you a million dollars outright?

26:27.600 --> 26:29.489
No, Richard. I'm not all right with it.

26:29.560 --> 26:31.369
I'm excited about it.

26:31.760 --> 26:34.969
Let's see how high this
rocket can fly, partner.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.411
Okay. Great.

26:40.240 --> 26:42.163
That's great. Uh...

26:42.560 --> 26:43.846
Not partners, exactly.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.441
But everything else is great.

26:48.680 --> 26:50.364
Call it what you want.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.611
Always blue, always blue, always blue,

26:55.680 --> 26:58.331
always blue, always blue, always blue,

26:58.400 --> 27:00.209
always blue, always...

27:00.440 --> 27:02.090
Oh, that was a yellow.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.201
What was that, 17?

27:03.280 --> 27:05.203
- It's pretty good.
- Hey, guys...

27:05.360 --> 27:07.806
Guys, can I just kind of say
something real quick?

27:07.880 --> 27:10.042
I know it's stupid but...

27:10.680 --> 27:12.489
I just want to say, uh,

27:12.560 --> 27:16.485
I'd like for this company
to just be different than Hooli

27:16.560 --> 27:18.608
and Goolybib and all the rest, you know?

27:18.680 --> 27:21.411
Like, let's like not turn this
into a corporate cult

27:21.480 --> 27:25.121
with bike meetings and voluntary retreats
that are actually mandatory.

27:25.200 --> 27:28.329
And claiming to make the world
a better place all the time.

27:28.720 --> 27:31.963
Let's, uh... Let's just think different.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.083
Uh, don't think different. That's Apple.

27:36.560 --> 27:38.244
Let's just... Let's just do it.

27:38.320 --> 27:39.845
- That's Nike, man.
- I know that's Nike.

27:39.920 --> 27:40.921
- Yeah.
- Uh...

27:42.240 --> 27:44.766
Fuck it. I don't know.
Let's just make it... Let's make it happen.

27:44.840 --> 27:46.365
Yeah, agreed.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.490
To his beneficence.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.005
Peter Gregory?

27:51.080 --> 27:53.686
- The dark lord.
- Of course, the dark lord.

27:53.760 --> 27:55.967
Big Head.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.729
God, he's worse high.

28:02.960 --> 28:07.488
Always blue, always blue,
always blue, always blue, always blue...

28:07.560 --> 28:09.449
Always blue, always...
