WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.169
Previously on East Los High.

00:02.678 --> 00:04.480
GIRL:
 They used to be the Bomb Squad,

00:04.547 --> 00:06.349
and now they're just the squad
that bombed.

00:06.416 --> 00:07.683
( girls laughing )

00:07.750 --> 00:10.553
( screaming )

00:11.692 --> 00:13.494
You are no longer
a dance captain.

00:13.560 --> 00:15.028
Who else is going to lead
the Bomb Squad?

00:15.095 --> 00:17.698
I'll whip those girl's sorry
asses into shape.

00:17.764 --> 00:19.132
Do you really think you can
handle them?

00:19.399 --> 00:20.834
Got the job at East Los!

00:20.901 --> 00:23.370
CECI:
 New dance coach in the house.

00:23.437 --> 00:24.838
Where are you going?

00:24.905 --> 00:26.673
Why do you keep hanging out
with that new girl?

00:26.740 --> 00:28.642
Tiffany's okay once you
get to know her.

00:28.709 --> 00:30.711
JOCELYN:
 The police aren't doing enough
to find her.

00:30.777 --> 00:33.914
How are we even best friends?
Wherever I go, you go.

00:43.490 --> 00:44.958
( mellow theme playing )

01:18.058 --> 01:20.527
( sighs )

01:56.997 --> 01:59.066
Well, God gives you gifts,
you gotta show them.

01:59.132 --> 02:02.436
Not gifts. Those tetas cost you
a 1000 bucks in Tijuana.

02:02.502 --> 02:04.671
( door opening )

02:04.738 --> 02:06.974
You weren't here last night.
CAMILIA: Oh, you noticed.

02:07.040 --> 02:10.644
You know, if you're gonna screw
around, you better use condones.

02:10.711 --> 02:12.879
I'm way too young
to be an abuelita.

02:12.946 --> 02:14.448
Why can't you be more
like your sister?

02:14.514 --> 02:16.049
Go meet someone
who's not married.

02:16.116 --> 02:18.418
Maybe someone who can
actually take care of you.

02:18.485 --> 02:20.554
Good advice.
Why don't you take it?

02:20.621 --> 02:25.859
Aye ya. Okay ready, Ma.
Take a look.

02:25.926 --> 02:27.995
Aye, que hermosa!

02:28.061 --> 02:30.397
You're my talented one.

02:30.464 --> 02:33.400
You're seriously going to work
looking like that?

02:33.467 --> 02:35.535
If you weren't screwing around,
you'd know I lost my job.

02:35.602 --> 02:37.070
Oh, great, so now you're
gonna be a hooker?

02:37.137 --> 02:38.472
At least I would
get paid for it,

02:38.538 --> 02:39.740
( speaking in Spanish )

02:39.806 --> 02:42.142
giving it out for free.
You guys, stop.

02:42.409 --> 02:44.077
Leo's taking mom
to Morongo Casino.

02:44.144 --> 02:47.014
No mija, it's Chuy.
Leo and I broke up a month ago.

02:47.080 --> 02:49.082
You're not going nowhere till
you leave us rent money.

02:49.349 --> 02:52.119
Mensa. Why do you think
I'm going to an Indian casino?

02:52.386 --> 02:54.855
To pick up Indians?
I'm going to win us the money.

02:54.921 --> 02:56.823
Tsk. You'd do better hooking.
( car horn honking )

02:56.890 --> 03:01.695
You're real lucky my ride
just got here, Camilia Maria.

03:01.762 --> 03:05.399
Real lucky. Por que si no--

03:05.465 --> 03:07.968
I'll be back tomorrow night.
Wish me luck!

03:08.035 --> 03:10.437
Bye, Ma.

03:13.707 --> 03:16.443
Hey, I got us some breakfast.

03:16.510 --> 03:19.112
Thanks.

03:19.346 --> 03:20.914
So where were you last night?

03:20.981 --> 03:23.450
Jocelyn's.

03:23.517 --> 03:27.020
Oh, okay, uh.
Let me know next time,

03:27.087 --> 03:28.555
I was kind of worried.

03:28.622 --> 03:31.892
Amber missing and everything.

03:31.958 --> 03:33.593
( sighs )

03:33.660 --> 03:36.863
( ominous theme playing )

03:36.930 --> 03:40.801
( loud clanging )

03:40.867 --> 03:45.839
Please. Please, don't hurt me.
Please.

04:27.948 --> 04:30.817
I gotta show a car
this morning, babe.

04:30.884 --> 04:32.486
Okay where is--?

04:34.121 --> 04:35.789
For real?

04:35.856 --> 04:37.357
Too much?

04:37.424 --> 04:39.826
For a stripper, no.
But for school, yeah.

04:39.893 --> 04:41.962
But I always dressed
like this for Bomb Squad.

04:42.028 --> 04:45.065
Yeah but you're their coach now.
You gotta look respectable.

04:45.132 --> 04:47.834
Then what am I supposed to wear?
I'm so nervous.

04:47.901 --> 04:51.438
Now now, come here. Wear
the shirt I got you last week.

04:51.505 --> 04:52.706
You look great in it.

04:52.773 --> 04:55.142
Yeah.
Yeah.

04:55.408 --> 04:58.545
Thanks for having my back, babe.
I got your front too.

04:58.612 --> 05:01.014
Don't forget that.
All right? Go change.

05:01.081 --> 05:02.482
( speaks in Spanish )

05:08.955 --> 05:11.625
Thank you so much for taking
a chance on me, Miss A.

05:11.691 --> 05:13.927
You know I had to convince
the principal

05:13.994 --> 05:15.729
that even with
no coaching experience,

05:15.796 --> 05:18.098
you could whip these girls
into shape.

05:18.365 --> 05:21.368
In a week! You can tell that
to the principal.

05:21.434 --> 05:24.905
Good luck, Ceci.
We both need this.

05:24.971 --> 05:26.640
Luck's got nothing
to do with it.

05:26.706 --> 05:29.042
I know how to make those girls
listen to me.

05:29.109 --> 05:31.578
( upbeat music playing )

05:34.548 --> 05:36.516
( yelling in Spanish )

05:36.583 --> 05:38.552
( crowd yells )

05:51.598 --> 05:52.966
What the hell?
What the hell?

05:53.033 --> 05:55.569
Listen up!
When I was the captain,

05:55.635 --> 05:58.505
East Los won the State
Championship two years in a row.

05:58.572 --> 06:01.508
So?

06:01.575 --> 06:04.411
So I'm a winner.
And you're all losers.

06:04.477 --> 06:07.614
How the hell did you lose
to the El Sereno Elegants?

06:07.681 --> 06:09.883
Ha-ha. Watch and learn!

06:11.618 --> 06:14.654
( hip hop music playing )

06:16.556 --> 06:18.491
What a conceited bitch.

06:18.558 --> 06:20.727
TIFFANY:
If she starts doing
The Milkshake, I'm leaving.

06:20.794 --> 06:22.062
I think she's pretty good.

06:22.128 --> 06:23.864
Oh, shut up and hate her
already.

06:25.899 --> 06:29.769
I'm your new captain. If you all
can dance half as good as me,

06:29.836 --> 06:31.938
then we'll win the championship.

06:32.005 --> 06:34.774
I hope you're ready
to work your asses off.

06:36.543 --> 06:39.446
Hmm, not today.
I got cramps.

06:39.512 --> 06:42.082
Oh. Me too.
It hurts a lot.

06:42.349 --> 06:43.984
ALL:
Yeah.

06:44.050 --> 06:48.021
Aye. You know what they say
when girls cycle together.

06:48.088 --> 06:49.856
GIRL:
Ouch.

06:49.923 --> 06:52.926
Gina! You're on your period too.
Remember?

06:52.993 --> 06:56.696
Yeah, that's true. Sorry.

06:56.763 --> 06:59.532
CAMILIA:
Sorry.

06:59.599 --> 07:02.402
Where the hell are you going?
I'm supposed to coach you guys.

07:02.469 --> 07:04.371
Why don't you coach
those trophies?

07:04.437 --> 07:08.008
Yeah, or wear 'em as earrings?
You love them so much. Ha-ha.

07:08.074 --> 07:09.409
Get your asses back here.

07:09.476 --> 07:11.144
ALL:
Bye!

07:11.411 --> 07:12.879
I mean it!

07:12.946 --> 07:15.415
GIRL:
Ugh, I can't stand her.

07:19.119 --> 07:22.489
( bell ringing )

07:26.469 --> 07:28.537
Hey, hottie!
You miss me?

07:28.604 --> 07:30.439
I told you, in school
we don't talk.

07:30.506 --> 07:33.275
That's your rule,
not mine.

07:34.744 --> 07:36.112
I'm seeing you
tonight, right?

07:36.178 --> 07:38.781
Depends. Are you breaking up
with Gina?

07:38.848 --> 07:40.383
Gina!

07:40.449 --> 07:41.851
Hey, baby.

07:42.118 --> 07:43.853
What's going on?
Not much.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.755
I missed you last night.

07:45.821 --> 07:48.157
So where were you?

07:48.224 --> 07:50.526
Mind your own business.
Be nice.

07:50.593 --> 07:52.261
He had an English paper
to finish.

07:52.328 --> 07:53.663
Come on. Let's go.
Hey.

07:53.729 --> 07:55.297
Are we getting
our nails done on Sunday?

07:55.364 --> 07:57.500
Oh, yeah. For sure.
I gotta look good.

07:57.566 --> 07:59.835
I'm going to Diego's parents'
anniversary dinner that night.

08:00.102 --> 08:04.140
You are? It sounds like you're
already part of the family.

08:04.206 --> 08:06.375
Basically. Right, D-man?

08:06.442 --> 08:08.210
DIEGO:
For sure. Come on, let's go.

08:08.277 --> 08:10.279
I'll see you at practice.

08:13.816 --> 08:16.152
Hey.

08:16.218 --> 08:17.753
Hi.

08:17.820 --> 08:20.489
Uh, I was checking
the Siren's website.

08:20.556 --> 08:23.392
It's blowing up
with tips about Amber.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.728
I guess a lot of people
saw my interview.

08:25.795 --> 08:27.797
You were amazing.

08:28.064 --> 08:29.765
Oh, at the rally?

08:29.832 --> 08:32.702
No. Last night.

08:32.768 --> 08:35.271
( sighs )

08:35.337 --> 08:39.842
So you're okay
with what we--?

08:40.109 --> 08:42.578
Yeah, are you?

08:42.645 --> 08:45.715
I gotta admit.
I'm a little freaked out.

08:45.781 --> 08:48.818
I've never done anything
like that.

08:50.186 --> 08:53.522
With a girl.
Well, me neither.

08:53.589 --> 08:56.692
But it felt good, didn't it?

08:59.328 --> 09:02.064
Jocelyn, my parents
saw you on TV.

09:02.131 --> 09:04.200
You're like a celebrity.

09:04.266 --> 09:07.737
Yeah, my tia totally
wants your autograph.

09:07.803 --> 09:11.340
Well, tell them she's gonna be
on the radio tomorrow night.

09:11.407 --> 09:13.676
And who are you?
Her PR person?

09:13.743 --> 09:18.481
What if I am?
Let's go, Miss Reyes.

09:18.547 --> 09:20.616
( inaudible dialogue )

09:23.486 --> 09:25.321
( girls laughing )

09:25.387 --> 09:27.590
Rough first day?

09:27.656 --> 09:29.725
CECI:
No shit.

09:29.792 --> 09:32.061
Hey, hey!
Booya!

09:32.128 --> 09:34.597
( sighs )

09:34.663 --> 09:37.399
Can you believe
we're the teachers now?

09:38.734 --> 09:41.804
These bitches are tough.
I was nothing like this.

09:42.071 --> 09:44.607
Ceci, you were way worse. Even I
was a little scared of you.

09:44.673 --> 09:46.542
Yeah, right.

09:46.609 --> 09:49.378
I think being a mom
has really chilled you out.

09:49.445 --> 09:51.380
I guess you grow up quick
when you have a baby.

09:53.115 --> 09:56.752
GIRL:
What's for lunch, Ceci? Ha-ha!

09:56.819 --> 09:58.487
Those bitches!

09:59.555 --> 10:02.825
Stop. Ceci. Down.

10:04.527 --> 10:06.262
They want you to lose it.

10:06.328 --> 10:09.165
What am I supposed to do?
Just take it?

10:09.231 --> 10:11.567
What do you do
when Isela throws a tantrum?

10:11.634 --> 10:14.570
Lock her ass in the closet.
I'm kidding.

10:14.637 --> 10:17.740
No, I chill and remind myself
that I'm the mom,

10:17.807 --> 10:19.475
and that I'm in charge.

10:19.542 --> 10:22.645
Okay. Well, you do that here.
You're in charge.

10:26.215 --> 10:28.751
( sighs )

10:33.589 --> 10:36.125
Good luck, Ceci.

10:38.727 --> 10:40.696
Stupid puntas.

10:42.131 --> 10:44.533
ALL:
Bye!

10:46.335 --> 10:49.305
And then they filled my lunch
bag full of tampons.

10:49.371 --> 10:52.208
Ha-ha.
Can you believe those skonkas?

10:52.274 --> 10:54.310
So then quit.
No, I'm no quitter.

10:54.376 --> 10:55.811
I was ready to snatch those
bitches up,

10:56.078 --> 10:59.582
but then Jacob was like
"calm down and play it cool--"

10:59.648 --> 11:03.219
Jacob? What's he doing
back at East Los?

11:03.285 --> 11:05.154
He's the assistant
football coach.

11:05.221 --> 11:06.689
Was he coming on to you?

11:06.755 --> 11:09.625
No. You know he's with Maya.
He was just being nice.

11:09.692 --> 11:12.695
Come on, Ceci. Guys are only
nice when they want something.

11:12.761 --> 11:15.264
All right. And they always want
something. Don't forget that.

11:15.331 --> 11:19.268
Jacob? He's Maya's man.
He was just giving me advice.

11:19.335 --> 11:21.470
So why you talking to me?

11:21.537 --> 11:23.572
It sounds like you and Jacob
got it all figured out.

11:23.639 --> 11:26.141
Really?
That's what it sounds like.

11:26.208 --> 11:27.843
Stop trippin'.

11:29.778 --> 11:34.316
You know you're my man.
I love you.

11:34.383 --> 11:37.186
Dinner with your freaking
parents? Are you kidding me?

11:37.253 --> 11:38.654
It's not my fault.
They invited her.

11:38.721 --> 11:40.789
Because they know her.
They don't know me.

11:40.856 --> 11:42.191
You gotta give me time.

11:42.258 --> 11:43.759
What do you think
I've been doing?

11:43.826 --> 11:46.128
First, you lied and said you
didn't have a girlfriend.

11:46.195 --> 11:48.597
Then you lied and said
you guys were just casual.

11:48.664 --> 11:51.667
Then you lied again and said
you were breaking up with her.

11:51.734 --> 11:55.170
I'm not stupid. I was class
secretary at Yuma High!

11:55.237 --> 11:56.672
You're so sexy
when you're angry.

11:56.739 --> 11:59.275
It's not gonna work this time,
Diego. I mean it.

11:59.341 --> 12:02.177
So you want me to stop?

12:02.244 --> 12:04.179
We should get a condom.

12:04.246 --> 12:05.381
Why? I'm clean down there.

12:05.447 --> 12:07.116
What about Gina?

12:07.182 --> 12:10.085
I swear you're the only girl
getting a taste of this.

12:10.152 --> 12:11.754
Gina's a virgin.
( scoffs )

12:11.820 --> 12:14.523
Still?
Then, why are you with her?

12:14.590 --> 12:17.793
Because she's your friend.
I gotta break it off right.

12:18.060 --> 12:19.428
I'm thinking of you, Tiff.

12:19.495 --> 12:22.398
You know you're my girl,
 por vida.

12:22.464 --> 12:25.567
( phone buzzing )

12:27.169 --> 12:28.771
Aren't you going
to answer it?

12:28.837 --> 12:32.374
See. How's that?

12:32.441 --> 12:34.143
( upbeat theme playing )

12:34.209 --> 12:37.846
So, you wanna do it
doggie-style?

12:39.214 --> 12:40.449
Woof.

12:40.516 --> 12:42.084
( giggles )

12:51.727 --> 12:55.431
PEDRO: See you later?
CECI: Yeah.

12:55.497 --> 12:57.599
Aren't you gonna wave
at your boyfriend?

12:57.666 --> 13:00.402
Shut up. You know you're my man.

13:00.469 --> 13:02.304
Love you.

13:04.406 --> 13:05.808
Later.
Bye.

13:06.075 --> 13:10.145
All right, come on.
On five, six, seven, eight.

13:10.212 --> 13:12.815
Punch. Back. Right. Left.

13:13.082 --> 13:16.719
Around. Down. Front. Drop it.

13:16.785 --> 13:20.389
Drop it. Glide.

13:20.456 --> 13:22.091
Again.

13:22.157 --> 13:26.495
Not bad, but try it like this.
It'll look stupid.

13:26.562 --> 13:29.665
One, two, three, four,

13:29.732 --> 13:33.635
five, six, seven, eight.

13:33.702 --> 13:36.205
Real stupid.
( girls laugh )

13:36.271 --> 13:39.708
Okay, look. I've never
done this before.

13:39.775 --> 13:42.077
What? Douche?

13:42.144 --> 13:43.512
( girls laughing )

13:43.579 --> 13:46.815
No. Apologize.

13:47.082 --> 13:50.452
I came off
really strong yesterday.

13:50.519 --> 13:52.121
Look, we all want
the same thing.

13:52.187 --> 13:55.657
For the Bomb Squad
to be on top, right?

13:55.724 --> 13:58.193
Right?

13:58.260 --> 14:00.662
Let's start loosening up
with some stretches.

14:00.729 --> 14:03.599
You just had a baby. Aren't you
stretched out enough?

14:03.665 --> 14:06.368
GIRL: Oh, no.
Yo. It's on.

14:06.435 --> 14:09.238
I am in charge here.
You need to listen to me.

14:09.304 --> 14:13.542
You have no discipline,
no technique and no game.

14:13.609 --> 14:15.811
Thanks for telling us
how shitty we are.

14:16.078 --> 14:17.346
I'm just trying
to help you!

14:17.413 --> 14:19.248
Why don't you go help
your daughter,

14:19.314 --> 14:21.150
so she doesn't get knocked up
in kindergarten.

14:21.216 --> 14:23.385
Camilia. Stop.
Don't talk shit about my baby.

14:23.452 --> 14:26.388
I'll kick your ass, you bitch.
Bring it.

14:26.455 --> 14:28.424
You pinche putas
 better listen to me.

14:28.490 --> 14:31.593
You are not
going to mess up my job.

14:31.660 --> 14:34.363
I am in charge here.
So start warming the hell up,

14:34.430 --> 14:36.732
or I'm gonna fu-- each and every
one of you. I will grab you--

14:36.799 --> 14:39.735
Ceci!

14:39.802 --> 14:42.337
GIRL:
Oh ho! Busted.

14:42.404 --> 14:44.706
I can't have you cursing
at the students.

14:44.773 --> 14:46.508
Sorry, but they started it.

14:46.575 --> 14:48.677
Started it? What are you, 5?

14:48.744 --> 14:51.313
You said you would
handle these girls.

14:51.380 --> 14:53.182
Not behave
like one of them.

14:53.248 --> 14:55.384
You know. I should
fire you for this.

14:55.451 --> 15:00.322
No. Please, don't. This job
means everything to me.

15:00.389 --> 15:04.393
Any more trouble from you
and you're out of here.

15:04.460 --> 15:07.262
Do you understand?

15:07.329 --> 15:08.630
Do you?

15:08.697 --> 15:11.133
Yes.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.602
( upbeat theme playing )

15:16.472 --> 15:18.107
( speaking in Spanish )

15:27.216 --> 15:31.753
So you started
liking me when?

15:31.820 --> 15:33.822
I've always liked you.

15:34.056 --> 15:37.493
Ha-ha.
You know what I mean.

15:37.559 --> 15:41.096
Uh. I don't know.

15:41.163 --> 15:43.398
Probably at Fili's quinceañera--

15:43.465 --> 15:46.101
What?

15:46.168 --> 15:48.837
You were wearing
that white dress.

15:49.104 --> 15:51.206
I couldn't stop
looking at you.

15:51.273 --> 15:52.808
I was looking pretty good.
Huh?

15:53.075 --> 15:55.577
( both laughing )

15:55.644 --> 15:58.213
How come you never said
anything?

15:58.280 --> 16:01.517
I don't know.
I was too scared.

16:01.583 --> 16:04.586
I was waiting for you
to make the first move.

16:04.653 --> 16:08.056
Hmm. Like this?

16:14.163 --> 16:16.398
The security camera! My abuelo's
 gonna kill me.

16:16.465 --> 16:18.767
Oh, my gosh.
( sighs )

16:18.834 --> 16:20.469
What happened to the tape?

16:20.536 --> 16:22.604
I forgot.
I gave it to the cops.

16:22.671 --> 16:24.406
What the hell for?

16:24.473 --> 16:27.176
Last time I saw Amber
was here.

16:27.242 --> 16:29.378
I thought they could use it.

16:31.446 --> 16:33.515
( giggling )

16:36.552 --> 16:39.154
( mellow theme playing )

16:46.395 --> 16:49.431
Cool it.
My grandparents are home.

16:49.498 --> 16:51.366
Even better.

16:51.433 --> 16:54.436
They would freak
if they found out.

16:54.503 --> 16:56.772
It can be our secret.

16:56.838 --> 17:00.475
Nobody has to know
we're hooking up.

17:00.542 --> 17:04.146
Is that what we're doing?
Just hooking up?

17:04.213 --> 17:06.582
We're best friends,

17:06.648 --> 17:09.484
and now with benefits.

17:11.587 --> 17:14.790
But I want us to always be
best friends,

17:15.057 --> 17:17.359
no matter what.

17:19.228 --> 17:21.263
Promise me, right?

17:23.799 --> 17:26.168
Yeah. I promise.

17:32.708 --> 17:34.343
( knocking on door )

17:34.409 --> 17:38.647
Muchachas!
 I got a surprise for you.

17:38.714 --> 17:41.149
What is it, nana?

17:41.216 --> 17:43.385
What's up, sis?
Nicolas!

17:45.354 --> 17:47.756
You remember Camilia,
don't you?

17:49.391 --> 17:51.660
How can I forget?

17:51.727 --> 17:54.363
Remember when we stole that
paddle boat from Echo Park Lake?

17:54.429 --> 17:55.731
Yeah.

17:55.797 --> 17:57.499
Hey. You two stole the boat,
I didn't.

17:57.566 --> 17:59.434
Yeah, but you got in with us.

17:59.501 --> 18:00.836
And nana, it had
a big hole in it

18:01.103 --> 18:03.272
and it sank in the middle
of the lake, so--

18:03.338 --> 18:06.108
And Nicolas is like, "Help!
Help! I don't know how to swim.

18:06.174 --> 18:07.809
I'm a big pussy!"
Shut up, I'm from New York.

18:08.076 --> 18:09.378
I don't need to know
how to swim.

18:09.444 --> 18:10.779
And we're like,
"Stand up, pendejo,

18:10.846 --> 18:12.648
the lake's only 4 feet deep."

18:12.714 --> 18:14.816
( all laughing )

18:15.083 --> 18:18.086
Aye, Nicky. It's so good to have
you home, mija.

18:18.153 --> 18:21.456
It's good to be back. I never
felt like a foster kid here.

18:21.523 --> 18:23.158
That's because you weren't.

18:23.225 --> 18:27.329
The minute they placed you here,
you were familia.

18:27.396 --> 18:28.830
Como esta tu mama?

18:29.097 --> 18:31.833
She's back in rehab.

18:32.100 --> 18:33.602
She got with an old boyfriend,

18:33.669 --> 18:36.238
started drinking and shooting
up. But it's not her fault.

18:36.305 --> 18:37.839
You know. He took her down.

18:38.106 --> 18:40.409
JOSE:
Your mother took herself down,
 mijo.

18:40.475 --> 18:42.711
Nobody can take you down,
unless you let them.

18:44.613 --> 18:48.450
I'm sorry, Nicky.
You've got a home here.

18:48.517 --> 18:49.651
Always.

18:49.718 --> 18:51.520
As long as you
go to school.

18:51.586 --> 18:55.791
I don't got time for that.
My DJ work is about to blow up.

18:56.058 --> 18:57.426
Say what!

18:57.492 --> 18:59.127
You're going to work
the rest of your life.

18:59.194 --> 19:02.097
Right now, you go to school.

19:02.164 --> 19:03.765
Me entiendes?

19:05.133 --> 19:06.468
Si, señor.

19:09.738 --> 19:12.708
So Camilia, you going to let me
copy your homework?

19:12.774 --> 19:17.546
Sure. After I copy Jocelyn's.

19:17.612 --> 19:18.814
Nicki, eat your salad.

19:19.081 --> 19:20.515
No, nana. I don't like it.

19:20.582 --> 19:23.752
Don't play with your food.

19:23.819 --> 19:26.521
Why? It's good for my hair?
It's good for your hair--

19:26.588 --> 19:29.691
( mellow theme playing )

19:29.758 --> 19:32.661
( humming a lullaby )

19:32.728 --> 19:37.132
Mommy had a rough day today.
I almost lost my job.

19:37.199 --> 19:39.468
I gotta remember that I'm
in charge. Like Jacob said--

19:39.534 --> 19:40.736
PEDRO:
Ceci.

19:40.802 --> 19:42.204
Are you coming to bed, baby?

19:42.270 --> 19:44.606
Yeah, as soon as Isela's asleep.

19:44.673 --> 19:46.308
Hurry. I got something for you.

19:46.375 --> 19:50.178
Ay, not tonight, mi amor.

19:50.245 --> 19:51.613
What, you're getting
tired of me?

19:51.680 --> 19:54.583
No, I'm just burned out.

19:54.649 --> 19:57.386
I get it.

19:57.452 --> 19:58.687
Good night.
Good night.

19:58.754 --> 20:02.090
( whining )
Yes.

20:04.292 --> 20:05.594
( gasps )

20:05.660 --> 20:09.131
Hey.
Give me a kiss.

20:11.333 --> 20:14.703
Hey. I thought you might
need some help.

20:14.770 --> 20:17.139
No, we got it.

20:18.373 --> 20:20.275
( phone buzzes )

20:20.342 --> 20:21.610
Oh! Damn.

20:21.676 --> 20:24.212
I forgot my phone interview.

20:24.279 --> 20:27.783
Good having you back, bro.
Now, dry.

20:27.849 --> 20:29.785
Dry. Ha-ha.

20:38.727 --> 20:41.630
You've changed.

20:41.696 --> 20:43.298
Well, I hope so.

20:43.365 --> 20:45.667
Last time you saw me
was when I was 12.

20:48.103 --> 20:49.571
You've changed too.

20:49.638 --> 20:51.706
I know. I got a lot
better looking, right?

20:51.773 --> 20:54.843
Ha. Well, your head's definitely
gotten bigger.

20:55.110 --> 20:56.445
And parts of you have too.

20:56.511 --> 20:59.347
( smacks )
CAMILIA: Cochino!

20:59.414 --> 21:02.417
Hey. You guys seen my earbuds?

21:02.484 --> 21:05.654
Um, no, I haven't.

21:05.720 --> 21:07.556
Nah. Me neither.

21:07.622 --> 21:10.258
Ah. There they are.

21:12.727 --> 21:15.530
( mellow theme playing )

21:23.271 --> 21:25.574
( phone chimes )

21:25.640 --> 21:28.143
( dramatic theme playing )

21:45.060 --> 21:47.462
( upbeat theme playing )
