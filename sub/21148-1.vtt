01:01.312 --> 01:03.273
<i>I remember
when I was a little kid,</i>

01:03.356 --> 01:05.418
<i>I would scribble on every car
at my dad's shop to show</i>

01:05.441 --> 01:08.194
<i>I could paint lowriders just
like him and his car club,</i>

01:08.278 --> 01:10.447
<i>the Coasters.</i>

01:10.530 --> 01:11.570
<i>My pops used to tell me...</i>

01:14.284 --> 01:17.078
<i>That means, like, "You're like
a dog pissing on walls."</i>

01:18.621 --> 01:20.665
<i>Well, I guess
not much has changed.</i>

01:20.749 --> 01:22.417
<i>Still pissing on walls.</i>

01:24.169 --> 01:25.920
<i>For my pops,
all he cares about</i>

01:26.004 --> 01:27.714
<i>besides cruising
down the boulevard</i>

01:27.797 --> 01:29.758
<i>is when he's best in
show at Elysian Park.</i>

01:30.717 --> 01:33.887
<i>At Elysian Park, hundreds of car
clubs just like the Coasters</i>

01:33.970 --> 01:36.514
<i>come from all over LA
to try to win best in show.</i>

01:37.098 --> 01:39.934
<i>If you win, it's like you're the
king of the lowriding world.</i>

01:40.310 --> 01:42.187
<i>You get mad respect.</i>

01:42.270 --> 01:44.856
<i>But if you don't, well...</i>

01:45.774 --> 01:48.526
<i>It's kind of like
you don't even exist.</i>

02:09.881 --> 02:11.299
<i>If it was up to my pops,</i>

02:11.382 --> 02:13.676
<i>I'd be fixing cars
at his shop all day.</i>

02:15.220 --> 02:16.721
<i>I just want to
get my name seen.</i>

02:16.805 --> 02:18.389
<i>Show everybody that I'm here.</i>

02:20.517 --> 02:21.994
<i>There might be
hundreds of car clubs in LA,</i>

02:22.018 --> 02:23.370
<i>but there's
thousands of billboards</i>

02:23.394 --> 02:24.854
<i>that I've got to hit up.</i>

02:24.938 --> 02:26.523
<i>I put up my art for free.</i>

02:27.190 --> 02:29.567
<i>And he wastes his
money on car parts?</i>

02:29.651 --> 02:31.569
<i>That makes
no sense to me.</i>

02:34.364 --> 02:36.407
<i>I grew up in Boyle Heights.</i>

02:36.491 --> 02:37.951
<i>But for kids like me,</i>

02:38.034 --> 02:39.994
<i>LA isn't divided by
the Sixth Street Bridge.</i>

02:40.870 --> 02:42.664
<i>This whole city is my canvas.</i>

02:45.917 --> 02:48.670
Finally, pretty boy!
Took you long enough.

02:49.337 --> 02:52.048
Damn, Danny!
Man, you been doing too much!

02:52.131 --> 02:53.383
What's up, Chuy?

02:54.884 --> 02:56.594
I'm sorry, did I mess up
somebody's makeup?

02:57.428 --> 02:58.948
Who you trying to
impress anyways, huh?

02:59.430 --> 03:00.598
No one in this car.

03:00.682 --> 03:02.242
Oh, yeah? Well,
you missed a spot, look.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.942
Hey, we going or what, bitches?
Come on.

03:04.978 --> 03:06.247
We're going,
but they're not going to

03:06.271 --> 03:07.540
let you in with
that stupid jacket.

03:07.564 --> 03:09.875
This jacket's fire, dude.
I took it out of your mom's closet.

03:09.899 --> 03:11.234
So I know it's fire.

03:11.860 --> 03:13.403
Oh, shit!

03:15.864 --> 03:17.784
Come on, let's go!
What are you guys waiting for?

03:17.866 --> 03:19.552
I ain't buying you no shots.

03:19.576 --> 03:20.827
Hey!

03:20.910 --> 03:22.036
Hey!

03:28.793 --> 03:30.670
You get four
beers or two shots.

03:51.024 --> 03:54.068
<i>Me and my homies,
we've never been to Mexico.</i>

03:54.152 --> 03:56.738
<i>And no,
our Spanish ain't perfect.</i>

03:56.821 --> 03:59.616
<i>But you could find us partying
with the hipsters in Echo Park,</i>

03:59.699 --> 04:01.868
<i>chilling at
the skate park in Venice</i>

04:01.951 --> 04:03.494
<i>or doing karaoke in K-town.</i>

04:05.163 --> 04:07.874
<i>All right, sometimes, we do
end up the night at Taco Zone.</i>

04:07.957 --> 04:09.250
<i>Yeah, we eat tacos.</i>

04:10.460 --> 04:11.461
<i>So what?</i>

04:19.427 --> 04:21.012
I love you, bitches.

04:47.121 --> 04:49.141
Stop the car! Stop the car!
What, what? What's wrong?

04:49.165 --> 04:50.416
I got to piss.

04:51.167 --> 04:52.853
Come on, I got to piss.
I'm begging you. Oh, Danny.

04:56.172 --> 04:58.052
- I promise it'll be fast. Yes.
- Hurry up.

04:58.132 --> 04:59.467
Hey, hurry up.

05:00.843 --> 05:02.196
He always takes
a long time to pee.

05:02.220 --> 05:03.513
Why did he take his bag?

05:09.811 --> 05:11.145
Oh, my God.

05:13.231 --> 05:14.482
What are you doing?

05:16.025 --> 05:17.944
Danny, I'm leaving!
Okay?

05:18.027 --> 05:19.213
I'm not going to
go to jail for you!

05:23.533 --> 05:25.785
What are you doing?
Are you trying to get us caught?

05:25.868 --> 05:27.954
Chill out, Claud!
I'm just trying to have some fun!

05:28.037 --> 05:30.277
Yeah, but if we get caught,
that's my scholarship, Danny!

05:30.331 --> 05:31.934
Claudia, shut up!
Nobody's going to get caught!

05:31.958 --> 05:33.501
No, no, no!
You need to hurry up, man!

05:43.052 --> 05:44.178
You done?
I'm done.

05:48.891 --> 05:50.268
Are you serious?

05:50.351 --> 05:52.103
Oh, my God.

05:56.816 --> 05:57.817
Huh?

06:01.738 --> 06:03.823
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

06:03.906 --> 06:05.616
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
Where...

06:05.700 --> 06:07.493
He's not going to ruin
Columbia for me, okay?

06:07.577 --> 06:09.287
No, no, no.
I understand that! Stop.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.265
Okay. Yeah, yeah, I'm stopping,
I'm stopping. Completely fine!

06:11.289 --> 06:13.559
That's completely fine! But you
can't leave us! You can't leave us!

06:13.583 --> 06:15.710
Get out!

06:16.252 --> 06:17.712
Damn it!

06:18.755 --> 06:19.797
Danny!

06:22.592 --> 06:24.512
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit!

06:25.261 --> 06:26.637
You mother...

06:27.972 --> 06:29.057
Five-o!

06:31.100 --> 06:32.143
Come on.

06:50.870 --> 06:52.288
Chuy, Chuy! Chuy!
This way.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.545
Chuy, run, Chuy! Chuy!
I'm running!

07:00.671 --> 07:02.465
Chuy, up here!
Right here. What?

07:02.548 --> 07:03.966
Dude, I can't do that!

07:04.842 --> 07:06.636
Come on, Chuy.
Hop it! Hurry up!

07:06.719 --> 07:08.554
What makes you
think I can do that?

07:08.638 --> 07:09.847
Oh, shit!

07:18.481 --> 07:20.316
Hurry up, Chuy!
Go, go, go!

07:30.493 --> 07:32.411
Freeze! Put your hands up!

07:32.495 --> 07:34.122
Hands up!
Put your hands up.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.759
<i>Daniel Alvarez?</i>
Already?

07:46.843 --> 07:48.094
<i>Chuy Herrera?</i>

07:49.387 --> 07:51.013
You two. Go.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.488
Chuy.

08:08.072 --> 08:09.115
You called my pops?

08:14.412 --> 08:15.538
I told you to call Claudia.

08:15.705 --> 08:16.789
She's still mad at you.

08:16.873 --> 08:19.154
And you know I ain't got nobody
that would've come for me.

08:26.591 --> 08:30.344
<i>And if you like
your cars old, slow and restored,</i>

08:30.428 --> 08:32.471
<i>the annual
lowrider competition</i>

08:32.554 --> 08:35.099
<i>at Elysian Park
is in three weeks.</i>

08:35.349 --> 08:37.309
<i>Good luck,
stay safe and ride them low.</i>

08:37.393 --> 08:41.938
I just want to say for, like,
whatever it's worth, uh, Mr. Alvarez...

08:42.023 --> 08:44.942
<i>Señor</i> Alvarez.
Uh, sir. I'm sorry.

08:45.026 --> 08:47.945
I, uh...
I'm going to pay you back...

08:48.529 --> 08:50.698
...every dime and cent.

08:50.781 --> 08:54.994
But I ain't got
no job right now,

08:55.077 --> 08:58.414
so...
You might have to wait.

08:58.497 --> 09:01.876
I mean, or I could work at
your shop if you want me to.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.544
He doesn't need your
ass there, Chuy.

09:04.295 --> 09:05.671
That's what
he's got me for.

09:06.797 --> 09:08.716
To do all his
bitch work.

09:09.258 --> 09:11.385
Maybe he needs another bitch,
man, all right?

09:11.469 --> 09:13.095
It ain't always
about you, Danny.

09:13.179 --> 09:15.181
Oh, my bad, Chuy.
I was distracted by your hair.

09:15.264 --> 09:17.099
You look like
a Mexican Eazy-E.

09:17.183 --> 09:19.393
You know my hair is
gorgeous as hell, man.

09:19.477 --> 09:21.854
Do you have any idea
what this cost your family?

09:22.563 --> 09:25.733
Writing your name
on other people's property?

09:25.816 --> 09:27.568
Scribbling like a toddler?

09:28.027 --> 09:29.338
Well, you're the one
who always said

09:29.362 --> 09:30.988
Mom encouraged me
to scribble, so...

09:31.781 --> 09:33.407
Don't you have
an ounce of shame?

09:34.909 --> 09:37.745
A real artist. Not a criminal,
like your brother.

09:39.205 --> 09:40.957
You know he wanted to see me?

09:52.969 --> 09:54.887
Fine.
I'll let you be the grown-up.

09:55.805 --> 09:57.932
Maybe then I'll stop
scribbling on walls.

10:07.316 --> 10:09.151
I love this song.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.030
Let me tell you something.

10:13.114 --> 10:15.074
Building a nice ride is like

10:15.157 --> 10:17.618
making love to
a beautiful woman.

10:18.786 --> 10:21.664
You can tell a lot about a man
from the ride he's got.

10:22.832 --> 10:26.544
White boys, they want
their cars to go fast!

10:29.338 --> 10:33.592
Asians want teeny-weeny little
cars that go even faster!

10:36.304 --> 10:38.097
But Mexicans,

10:38.180 --> 10:40.016
we like it low

10:40.099 --> 10:41.600
and slow.

10:42.143 --> 10:44.246
You going to break a
hip, homie. You better relax.

10:44.270 --> 10:46.230
All right, all right.

10:46.314 --> 10:47.833
Hey, I'm sorry I missed
the meeting. Okay?

10:47.857 --> 10:50.901
But this is still a business.
Okay? Let's get back to work.

10:52.862 --> 10:54.196
Hey, Daniel.

10:55.406 --> 10:57.825
I want you to start
clearing the, uh, graveyard.

10:59.410 --> 11:01.078
Since when do you
care about that shit?

11:01.162 --> 11:03.205
Since you got arrested,
<i>cabroncito.</i>

11:04.332 --> 11:07.376
That shit back there,
that's my savings account.

11:08.419 --> 11:10.421
Everything back there
is valuable. All right?

11:11.088 --> 11:13.674
That's how you're gonna pay me
back for getting you out of jail.

11:25.644 --> 11:28.397
Hey, boss.
You okay, or what?

11:31.525 --> 11:34.028
Never seen you cut a Coasters
meeting like that before.

11:34.111 --> 11:35.613
No.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.490
Everything's not cool,
homes.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.493
We have Elysian Park
in a few weeks.

11:41.577 --> 11:43.245
I should have stayed here.
You know?

11:44.413 --> 11:45.831
Working on Green Poison.

11:47.208 --> 11:48.542
Not bailing out my son.

11:48.626 --> 11:51.462
Yeah, well, I wonder
where he gets that from.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.756
Man, we used to get busted
all the time lowriding, man.

11:53.839 --> 11:54.941
Riding dirty past them cops?

11:54.965 --> 11:57.652
Could barely fit a quarter between
the fender and the street, you know?

11:57.676 --> 11:59.696
What was the name of that fat girl, man?
You know, the tank?

11:59.720 --> 12:00.989
You know the one
I'm talking about?

12:01.013 --> 12:02.181
Oh, Lydia?

12:02.264 --> 12:04.624
Lydia. That's right.
Had a little light mustache.

12:04.683 --> 12:07.520
Tell you what, man. She wanted
to ride in your ride so bad.

12:07.603 --> 12:08.803
The only reason
why you let her

12:08.896 --> 12:10.123
is 'cause she'd
drop it three inches.

12:11.899 --> 12:14.276
I don't know, boss.
You stress too much.

12:14.360 --> 12:15.653
Green Poison is famous.

12:16.278 --> 12:18.531
I mean, she's probably gonna
win best in Elysian.

12:21.617 --> 12:22.701
I need to.

12:24.161 --> 12:27.873
Only way we going to get some
business through that door, you know?

12:55.985 --> 12:58.612
Think I'm gonna have to cut
half a turn on the coil.

12:59.822 --> 13:02.908
Then she'll lay
three inches more.

13:02.992 --> 13:04.832
You could do that,
or we could call Lydia back.

13:22.094 --> 13:25.014
Hey! You know the rules.
No phone until after homework.

13:25.097 --> 13:26.432
I already did it.

13:26.557 --> 13:27.892
Oh, good!
Then you can help me.

13:32.730 --> 13:34.815
Hey, baby.
Hello, <i>mi amor.</i>

13:36.859 --> 13:38.235
How was work?

13:38.360 --> 13:39.695
Mmm. It was good.

13:39.778 --> 13:41.658
Did you cut half a turn
on the coil like I said?

13:42.281 --> 13:44.366
Yeah, we're working on it.

13:44.450 --> 13:45.826
It'll lay three more inches!

13:45.910 --> 13:47.077
I know.

13:48.454 --> 13:50.873
Hey, Danny.
Are you okay?

13:52.458 --> 13:53.792
I'm fine.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.378
Okay.
Get ready for dinner.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.547
Hi, <i>flaquita.</i>
Hey, Danny.

14:00.758 --> 14:03.385
Isabel. You have to eat the
chicken too, not just the rice.

14:06.180 --> 14:07.890
And don't forget,
tomorrow we are going

14:08.015 --> 14:09.775
to Mrs. Aguilar's for
your <i>quinceañera</i> dress.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.560
Ma, Mrs. Aguilar?

14:11.644 --> 14:13.979
Look, I already told you I
found my dress at Forever 21.

14:14.063 --> 14:15.981
You're not going to
wear a store dress.

14:16.065 --> 14:17.399
Forever 21?
You ain't no 21.

14:17.566 --> 14:18.859
That's the point.

14:18.943 --> 14:21.254
If it's up to her, I'm going to
look like it's my first communion.

14:22.446 --> 14:23.590
You have a date already,
<i>flaquita loca?</i>

14:24.740 --> 14:27.785
Hey. No dates, all right.
You're too young.

14:30.746 --> 14:32.164
Have you heard from Francisco?

14:35.668 --> 14:36.752
You mean Ghost?

14:37.628 --> 14:40.923
He got out this week.
Wondering if you heard from him.

14:45.511 --> 14:47.638
So, is he going to stay here?

14:47.721 --> 14:49.431
He's more than
welcome to if he wants.

14:50.224 --> 14:51.934
We're not talking
about that.

14:53.936 --> 14:54.937
Why not?

15:03.445 --> 15:04.506
Why can't we
talk about Ghost?

15:11.370 --> 15:12.663
Danny! Wait!

15:15.040 --> 15:16.458
Leave him alone.

15:48.324 --> 15:49.533
Who's there?

16:01.712 --> 16:02.880
Will you look at that?

16:07.217 --> 16:08.844
I'm back for two seconds.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.139
You're already
trying to kill me?

16:17.227 --> 16:18.228
Come here.

16:18.854 --> 16:20.105
Show your big brother
some love.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.529
Oh, man.

16:29.198 --> 16:30.866
Look at this pretty boy.

16:31.867 --> 16:33.827
How you been, <i>cariñito?</i>

16:39.166 --> 16:41.286
I'm sorry I didn't call you...
I didn't call you back.

16:41.335 --> 16:44.046
Nah. Don't even trip.

16:49.468 --> 16:50.594
I'm back now.

16:57.101 --> 16:59.478
What's this?
Huh? What is this?

16:59.561 --> 17:00.854
What are you doing in here?

17:02.856 --> 17:04.316
Oh, yeah?

17:04.400 --> 17:06.402
You got into
graffiti and shit.

17:06.484 --> 17:08.569
A little bit.
A little tagger.

17:10.114 --> 17:12.281
Hey, you need
a place to stay?

17:12.366 --> 17:14.827
No, man. I got a place.

17:21.916 --> 17:23.460
You take her out yet?

17:23.544 --> 17:24.712
No.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.966
My <i>abuelito</i> did that mural.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.093
That's the only reason
she's worth anything.

17:32.928 --> 17:34.096
Pops ever tell you that?

17:34.722 --> 17:35.889
No.
Yeah.

17:37.015 --> 17:39.601
A lot of things he didn't tell you.
Come on.

18:09.673 --> 18:13.010
Get in. We're going to
celebrate my freedom.

18:14.553 --> 18:16.430
Come on, little bro.
It's all good.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.016
I don't know, Ghost.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.809
You don't know?

18:32.696 --> 18:34.156
So, where them hoes at?

18:34.239 --> 18:35.991
I know a place
we could hit up.

18:37.659 --> 18:40.245
You think we can, uh, swoop up
my homie first real quick?

18:41.038 --> 18:43.165
For sure.
Anything you want, bro.

18:51.089 --> 18:52.716
That's him.

18:57.471 --> 18:59.681
Cut the hair, you
might land that Ollie, fool.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.351
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:03.227 --> 19:04.686
Holy shit.

19:07.773 --> 19:10.108
What's up?
I don't know if you remember me.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.610
I'm Chuy Herrera.

19:11.693 --> 19:13.946
Yeah, I remember you,
Chuyito.

19:14.029 --> 19:15.614
So, what's up?
You gonna come or what?

19:15.697 --> 19:18.659
For real? I mean, is it...
Is it cool with you?

19:18.742 --> 19:20.911
If he says you're cool,
you're cool, little homie.

19:22.079 --> 19:24.081
But you ain't bringing
that board in this ride.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.959
What, uh... Shit, this?

19:28.377 --> 19:29.920
I'm done with it!

19:31.046 --> 19:32.589
Don't touch anything.

19:34.216 --> 19:35.717
You down to go to the Smell?

19:35.801 --> 19:36.927
There are ladies there?

19:37.052 --> 19:39.388
You
don't even know.

19:39.471 --> 19:41.098
You do, huh?
Oh, yeah.

19:41.181 --> 19:44.560
All of them. Inside and out,
like the back of my hand.

19:45.102 --> 19:47.145
They be coming
on me like honey.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.814
That's ridiculous.

20:08.292 --> 20:10.335
Dawg, what is this?

20:12.087 --> 20:13.940
It looks like a bounce house
full of retarded skaters.

20:13.964 --> 20:16.049
It's awesome.

20:54.463 --> 20:55.464
I'll be back.

21:15.484 --> 21:16.652
You don't like dancing?

21:16.818 --> 21:17.986
What?

21:19.071 --> 21:21.406
Everybody's dancing.
You're just here sitting all alone.

21:23.659 --> 21:25.994
Well,
I didn't come here to dance.

21:26.078 --> 21:27.398
Well, then,
why did you come here?

21:31.667 --> 21:33.307
You came here to look
at derivative photos

21:33.335 --> 21:34.878
on the wall
nobody ever looks at?

21:38.090 --> 21:39.800
Yeah, well,
I took them, so...

21:41.134 --> 21:42.135
Yeah.

21:43.470 --> 21:46.598
I like them. I mean,
I guess they're not so bad.

21:46.682 --> 21:47.933
They're black.
They're white...

21:48.058 --> 21:49.351
Are we done?

21:55.023 --> 21:56.623
So what, you're not
gonna talk to me now?

21:58.485 --> 22:01.321
Well, you know what?
That's a problem.

22:01.405 --> 22:03.240
Because if you sell
one of those,

22:03.365 --> 22:05.200
you're gonna
owe me some money.

22:05.283 --> 22:06.493
Excuse me?

22:07.577 --> 22:08.704
That's my piece.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.498
Where? What, that?

22:12.207 --> 22:13.291
Yep.

22:14.376 --> 22:16.096
If that's your piece,
then what does it say?

22:17.921 --> 22:20.424
What do you mean?
It says "Draw." It's my tag name.

22:20.507 --> 22:23.051
Mmm.
Isn't that a little obvious?

22:23.760 --> 22:25.887
Well, what's your tag name?
"Hipster"?

22:30.851 --> 22:32.644
You don't believe that's me?

22:33.979 --> 22:35.647
I think you're
gonna have to prove it.

22:45.866 --> 22:47.701
Well, this isn't awkward.

22:47.784 --> 22:49.870
I showed you mine,
now you show me yours.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.873
Slow down, tiger.

22:52.956 --> 22:54.332
Oh, I'm a tiger?

22:54.416 --> 22:56.501
Well, you're a pussy.

22:56.585 --> 22:59.838
I'm a pussy?
You just call me a pussy?

22:59.921 --> 23:01.214
Mmm-hmm.
All right.

23:12.934 --> 23:14.144
See?

23:14.227 --> 23:16.480
Yeah?
Well, I can tag too.

23:17.105 --> 23:19.232
By the way,
my name is Lorelei.

23:20.233 --> 23:21.860
You better,
uh, write this down,

23:21.943 --> 23:25.322
'cause I'm not keeping it up
here for the whole world to see.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.324
Five. Four...

23:27.407 --> 23:28.407
Oh, come on. For real?

23:28.450 --> 23:30.077
Three...
Slow down.

23:31.244 --> 23:32.287
Two. One.

23:33.038 --> 23:34.372
Hey, Danny!

23:34.456 --> 23:36.249
You taking one of
your monster dumps?

23:37.292 --> 23:38.627
I don't know who
the hell that is.

23:38.710 --> 23:40.837
For real, hurry up,
your brother's leaving!

23:42.297 --> 23:43.507
I'll text you.

23:49.721 --> 23:51.640
Oh! Was it good?

24:08.490 --> 24:09.741
Let me see your ink.

24:11.660 --> 24:12.786
You designed that?

24:13.787 --> 24:15.288
Yeah.
It's tight.

24:16.790 --> 24:18.250
It's fading though.

24:18.333 --> 24:19.417
Yeah.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.336
I could fill that in
for you, if you want.

24:24.214 --> 24:25.841
You going to take it back now?

24:25.924 --> 24:28.760
<i>Simón ese.</i> I got you.

24:29.970 --> 24:31.656
I won't let you get in
trouble with the old man.

24:34.558 --> 24:36.101
How's he treating you anyway?

24:37.686 --> 24:38.854
He's still drinking?

24:40.522 --> 24:41.523
Nah.

24:42.274 --> 24:44.359
He's on that AA
12-step bullshit.

24:47.070 --> 24:48.155
You know he got remarried?

24:49.531 --> 24:50.907
Her name's Gloria.

24:54.870 --> 24:56.037
You going to see him?

24:59.833 --> 25:00.876
Shit.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.671
He didn't come
to see me one time

25:04.754 --> 25:06.256
in all the years I was busted.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.267
What makes you think
he'd want to see me now?

25:29.779 --> 25:31.048
<i>I remember when I was a kid,</i>

25:31.072 --> 25:34.159
<i>I used to watch my pops
and Ghost work on cars.</i>

25:35.660 --> 25:38.914
<i>My pops always said one day,
we'd all build a car together</i>

25:40.332 --> 25:42.125
<i>and win at
Elysian Park with it.</i>

25:48.882 --> 25:50.800
<i>He was never the same
after Mom passed.</i>

26:05.273 --> 26:08.360
<i>He always said,
"Lowriders are about family."</i>

26:16.368 --> 26:18.411
<i>Maybe he should take a look
at his family now.</i>

26:28.296 --> 26:30.149
Right on the hood.
It's, uh... It's kind of big.

26:30.173 --> 26:33.468
You know, you can't miss that.

26:34.302 --> 26:36.137
So, there's
no sign of forced entry?

26:36.221 --> 26:38.223
No. No broken windows,
no broken locks?

26:38.306 --> 26:39.766
No. Nothing like that.
Okay.

26:39.849 --> 26:41.351
It was a clean job.
All right.

26:43.645 --> 26:44.688
What happened?

26:44.771 --> 26:46.898
Someone, uh,
took Green Poison.

26:46.982 --> 26:49.442
Daniel? Come here. Quick.

26:52.070 --> 26:54.823
Green Poison is missing.
This is Detective Williams.

26:54.906 --> 26:56.199
How you doing, Danny?

26:57.617 --> 26:59.452
Your father tells me
you work here as well.

26:59.536 --> 27:01.896
I was wondering if you noticed
anything out of the ordinary.

27:03.540 --> 27:05.000
No?
No.

27:05.083 --> 27:06.167
You sure?

27:06.334 --> 27:07.419
Son, do you know anything?

27:07.502 --> 27:08.586
No.

27:33.153 --> 27:34.571
What's up, big homie?

27:34.654 --> 27:36.197
Shit, bro.
How you been?

27:36.948 --> 27:38.668
You're real funny,
you know that?

27:41.244 --> 27:42.412
What, Pops?

27:43.204 --> 27:44.581
No love for your oldest?

27:51.212 --> 27:52.547
I couldn't bring her back

27:54.257 --> 27:56.259
without a nice detailing.

27:56.343 --> 27:58.428
Courtesy of
Central City Car Club.

28:00.555 --> 28:01.973
My new club.

28:06.227 --> 28:07.228
She rode smooth, Pops.

28:08.438 --> 28:09.981
Better than I even remembered.

28:11.066 --> 28:12.859
A little loose on
the turns though.

28:14.069 --> 28:16.154
Might want to get that
checked out before Elysian.

28:18.823 --> 28:20.241
You would've been proud.

28:21.201 --> 28:24.537
Me and Danny cruising the
boulevard in your pride and joy.

28:26.206 --> 28:27.957
Ain't that what you
say you always wanted?

28:31.586 --> 28:33.546
Mr. Alvarez, you want
us to take him in?

28:34.422 --> 28:35.715
I'm happy to write it up.

28:37.133 --> 28:40.136
My manners. I'm sorry. I ain't
introduced myself, Officer.

28:40.220 --> 28:42.430
No, I know who
you are, Francisco.

28:42.514 --> 28:43.932
Yeah, I also
know your PO.

28:47.102 --> 28:48.269
Mr. Alvarez, your call.

28:50.772 --> 28:52.357
It's okay.

28:56.528 --> 28:58.071
That's my ride.

28:58.154 --> 28:59.864
I hope the shop's
been doing really well.

29:01.116 --> 29:03.410
'Cause that prize money might
just end up in my pocket.

29:11.584 --> 29:13.128
It was fun catching up, boys.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.798
I'll see you at Elysian, Pops.

29:47.620 --> 29:49.164
What were you thinking?

29:50.748 --> 29:51.875
Nothing happened.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.168
"Nothing happened."

29:53.251 --> 29:54.377
It's just a car.

29:56.463 --> 29:57.797
"Just a car"?

30:00.675 --> 30:02.343
Do you think
that's just a car?

30:03.511 --> 30:07.640
Do you know how much heart and
soul went into that car, Daniel?

30:08.850 --> 30:10.101
That is your heritage!

30:11.060 --> 30:12.520
It's priceless!

30:13.271 --> 30:15.315
This is a work of art!

30:15.398 --> 30:17.275
Something you know
nothing about!

30:21.613 --> 30:22.739
You know what?

30:26.618 --> 30:28.369
I guarantee you,

30:29.037 --> 30:30.538
I'm gonna make it
with my art.

30:35.752 --> 30:37.378
You're just like
your brother.

30:38.963 --> 30:41.966
You both are...
hopeless.

30:42.050 --> 30:43.718
He's your son, Pops!

30:45.637 --> 30:47.972
And you couldn't even
look him in the eye.

30:51.559 --> 30:53.439
You're gonna just pretend
like he doesn't exist?

30:54.312 --> 30:56.439
Like you have for
the past eight years, huh?

30:58.441 --> 31:00.068
Like how you
forgot about Mom?

31:42.902 --> 31:44.862
<i>Pops is always
calling Ghost a criminal.</i>

31:44.946 --> 31:46.406
<i>That he brought
shame to the family.</i>

31:47.156 --> 31:50.535
<i>You know why he went to prison?
Grand theft auto.</i>

31:50.618 --> 31:53.371
<i>For stealing car parts
just to finish his own ride.</i>

31:53.454 --> 31:56.124
<i>He got busted.
Caught a case.</i>

31:56.207 --> 31:57.667
<i>Ain't that some shit?</i>

32:11.472 --> 32:12.974
Oh, shit, Little D.

32:14.892 --> 32:16.227
Can I stay here?

32:19.022 --> 32:20.440
Hell, yeah.

32:29.157 --> 32:31.618
Central City headquarters
right here.

32:31.701 --> 32:33.453
We run an empire
out this bitch.

32:38.833 --> 32:40.873
I've been schooling
these fools on lowriders.

32:41.628 --> 32:44.172
This right here,
it's my pride and joy.

32:48.009 --> 32:51.763
When I was locked up, I wasn't
thinking about anything

32:51.846 --> 32:53.681
except for
winning at Elysian Park.

32:55.350 --> 32:57.894
I had Gordo start pulling parts
while I was still inside.

32:58.936 --> 33:01.856
My club and this
car right here,

33:01.939 --> 33:05.526
we're going to show Pops and the
Coasters what lowriding is all about.

33:06.903 --> 33:09.364
We just got to put your little
graffiti skills to work.

33:09.697 --> 33:11.366
Have you to put
a mural on this car.

33:14.827 --> 33:16.120
You ever hit
switches before?

33:17.038 --> 33:18.915
No.
Huh?

33:20.917 --> 33:22.043
See this right here?

33:22.168 --> 33:23.211
Mmm-hmm.

33:36.891 --> 33:38.393
You like what you see?

33:45.566 --> 33:47.378
So how do you like
your first art walk?

33:47.402 --> 33:48.528
It's all right.

33:48.653 --> 33:49.838
Okay, can you
tell me something?

33:49.862 --> 33:52.824
Like, is there... Is there a
time that you just get off

33:52.907 --> 33:55.743
being Mr. Tough Graffiti Guy?
Like, do you clock out ever?

33:55.827 --> 33:57.662
Maybe we could
go out then.

33:57.745 --> 33:59.205
All right,
that's not what I meant.

34:00.289 --> 34:03.000
I just...
I just don't buy that stuff

34:03.084 --> 34:06.629
because it's in a gallery, hanging on
a wall with a price tag next to it.

34:06.713 --> 34:08.065
It doesn't make it
any more legit than...

34:08.089 --> 34:09.297
What you do?

34:10.842 --> 34:12.760
I was gonna say,
than what you do.

34:12.844 --> 34:14.429
Right.

34:17.264 --> 34:18.766
Are you done?
Yes.

34:19.809 --> 34:23.521
If it's so easy to get a show,
then why don't you have one?

34:24.605 --> 34:26.899
That's because my show
is all over the city.

34:27.275 --> 34:28.317
Okay.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.735
So that everyone
can see it

34:29.819 --> 34:31.446
everywhere whenever
they want.

34:33.156 --> 34:34.449
Okay.

34:35.949 --> 34:37.452
Let's go see your show.

34:45.460 --> 34:46.960
Come on,
I'll show you the best part.

34:50.130 --> 34:51.799
Go ahead.
This?

34:52.091 --> 34:53.176
Is this a trick?

34:54.092 --> 34:55.762
Come on, Lorelei.
I'm in a skirt.

34:56.971 --> 34:58.598
Come on.
I swear I will be good.

34:59.974 --> 35:01.350
I'll be good.

35:01.434 --> 35:03.074
You said you wanted
to see my show, right?

35:03.853 --> 35:04.979
Well, it's up there.

35:08.399 --> 35:10.193
You'll be fine.
Okay. I'll try it.

35:10.276 --> 35:11.486
I'll help you. Come on.

35:11.611 --> 35:12.779
Well, all right.

35:19.744 --> 35:21.829
I bet this works
on all the girls.

35:22.413 --> 35:23.414
Some are actually smart.

35:31.005 --> 35:32.215
It's amazing.

35:37.512 --> 35:38.679
Is that it?

35:39.889 --> 35:41.849
Yeah. That's it.

35:46.354 --> 35:48.648
That's...
That's incredible, Danny.

35:48.731 --> 35:52.568
You're so talented,
it pisses me off.

36:19.220 --> 36:20.930
I get it.

36:21.013 --> 36:23.075
You're afraid you're going to
fall in love with me, huh?

36:24.392 --> 36:26.894
Yeah, you know
what I think?

36:26.978 --> 36:27.979
What?

36:28.062 --> 36:30.273
I think you're
the one who's afraid.

36:30.356 --> 36:31.858
Is that right?
Mmm-hmm.

36:33.317 --> 36:35.117
If you weren't scared,
you would have put that

36:35.194 --> 36:38.072
where everyone could see it
whenever they wanted to, remember?

36:39.240 --> 36:40.533
I'm on to you.

36:48.291 --> 36:51.252
Shit.

36:53.379 --> 36:55.298
Having some trouble?

36:56.048 --> 36:58.759
Gloria.
Don't scare me like that.

37:00.761 --> 37:03.472
I'm sorry I missed dinner.
I should've called you.

37:05.808 --> 37:07.268
I was hoping for a ride.

37:07.852 --> 37:10.479
Sounds like you're having some trouble.
Do you hear that?

37:10.563 --> 37:11.939
Yeah, I hear that.

37:13.024 --> 37:14.901
Can I get in here?

37:17.111 --> 37:18.613
Be my guest.

37:23.868 --> 37:25.828
We got Isabela's
<i>quinceañera</i> dress today.

37:27.496 --> 37:29.290
I'm pretty sure she
loves it, but you know,

37:29.373 --> 37:31.560
she'll never admit it because
that means I won, you know.

37:31.584 --> 37:33.294
<i>Chiquita. Cosita,</i> baby?

37:33.377 --> 37:35.147
If you're gonna work
on my car, could you at least

37:35.171 --> 37:36.964
not talk about dresses
while you do it?

37:38.507 --> 37:40.301
Sorry. Ah.

37:41.510 --> 37:44.388
The number eight plug wire.
It's arcing on the manifold.

37:44.472 --> 37:45.792
You're gonna need
to replace that.

37:46.682 --> 37:48.476
Great.

38:02.490 --> 38:04.051
When's the last time
you've been to a meeting?

38:04.075 --> 38:06.202
Baby, I'm not drinking.

38:07.203 --> 38:08.788
That was Angel's.

38:10.206 --> 38:11.540
I know, I just...

38:12.750 --> 38:14.251
I want to keep
it that way, okay?

38:15.878 --> 38:17.421
You talked to your sons?

38:18.422 --> 38:19.757
Okay.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.676
You know what?
Don't answer that.

38:23.427 --> 38:24.720
It's just,
I'm really worried.

38:26.973 --> 38:28.307
Especially about Danny.

38:29.141 --> 38:32.186
And Isabela really wants her
brother at her <i>quinceañera.</i>

38:42.113 --> 38:43.572
Can you try for me,
please?

38:53.416 --> 38:54.542
Promise me.

38:57.044 --> 38:58.254
Yeah, I promise.

39:00.172 --> 39:01.215
Thank you.

39:05.553 --> 39:07.096
Crenshaw Sunday's going down,

39:07.221 --> 39:08.901
right here, in
beautiful Cali-forn-eye-aye.

39:08.973 --> 39:11.642
It's your boy, Gordo.
It is what it is. It is what we do.

39:11.726 --> 39:14.246
Central City Car Club right here
in this bitch.

39:29.201 --> 39:31.138
<i>Sundays, all the young
clubs like to come out</i>

39:31.162 --> 39:33.205
<i>and show their cars
on Crenshaw Boulevard.</i>

39:33.289 --> 39:36.333
<i>It's not about a trophy.
It's about hitting the switch.</i>

39:36.417 --> 39:39.628
<i>Hitting back bumper and being the
baddest lowrider in the streets.</i>

39:40.171 --> 39:42.381
<i>They last until the cops
come and break 'em up,</i>

39:42.465 --> 39:44.508
<i>but that doesn't stop anyone.</i>

39:44.592 --> 39:46.427
<i>Theyjust go to a new spot.</i>

39:47.428 --> 39:49.513
<i>Look, I really don't
come to these things,</i>

39:49.597 --> 39:51.348
<i>but my brother does.</i>

39:51.432 --> 39:54.435
<i>And he says
girls love this shit.</i>

39:55.186 --> 39:56.896
<i>So why not, right?</i>

40:03.069 --> 40:04.278
Come on.

40:06.447 --> 40:07.448
What up?

40:07.531 --> 40:09.909
Oh, shit!
Danny, what's up, homie?

40:12.536 --> 40:13.829
What's up, Little D?

40:15.081 --> 40:16.207
You good?
Yeah.

40:16.290 --> 40:17.291
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

40:18.042 --> 40:19.043
Is this your girl?

40:19.126 --> 40:20.503
No...
Yeah, I am.

40:21.045 --> 40:22.129
Is this your brother?

40:23.964 --> 40:26.550
Ghost, Lorelei.
Lorelei, my brother, Ghost.

40:27.885 --> 40:29.970
Hey...
You want to hit the switches?

40:31.597 --> 40:33.516
Excuse me?
Are you with it?

40:33.599 --> 40:35.476
I don't...
I'm not quite sure what...

40:36.811 --> 40:38.411
You're with it. Come on.

40:38.938 --> 40:40.189
Right here.
Let me show you.

40:41.732 --> 40:42.817
Can I get in there?

40:45.569 --> 40:46.737
Be my guest.

40:55.162 --> 40:56.205
You ready?

40:56.413 --> 40:57.915
Whoa!

40:59.500 --> 41:03.129
Uh...
Oh, my God.

41:03.212 --> 41:04.338
I don't think you're ready.

41:05.256 --> 41:08.342
Ooh. Whoa!
Oh, my God!

41:09.176 --> 41:10.344
Oh!

41:17.518 --> 41:18.561
Bounce it up.

41:21.063 --> 41:23.500
<i>LAPD. You
have five seconds to disperse.</i>

41:23.524 --> 41:25.109
<i>We will impound your cars.</i>

41:48.799 --> 41:51.080
Always trying to roll with us, eh?

41:52.386 --> 41:53.596
Chill, homie. He's with us.

41:53.679 --> 41:55.014
Yeah, whatevs.

41:56.015 --> 41:58.142
What's up? This is Claudia.

42:00.477 --> 42:01.979
What you doing here,
Chuyito?

42:02.062 --> 42:03.898
Oh, I'm looking for Danny.

42:03.981 --> 42:05.733
We were supposed
to kick it with him.

42:05.816 --> 42:07.067
He ain't here, homes.

42:08.527 --> 42:10.237
Are you sure?
We had plans.

42:13.115 --> 42:14.992
Plan?

42:15.618 --> 42:17.912
Plans ain't mean <i>pito,</i>
when there's pussy involved.

42:20.164 --> 42:22.333
Oh. We probably
should go.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.460
Come on, Chuy.
You ready?

42:30.257 --> 42:31.342
Hey, fool?

42:32.301 --> 42:33.552
It's your turn.

42:35.262 --> 42:37.348
Come on, youngster,
we got to clean you up

42:37.431 --> 42:39.031
if you're gonna
chill with us at Elysian.

42:41.727 --> 42:43.270
No, Chuy.
Are you serious?

42:46.440 --> 42:47.441
Uh...

42:47.608 --> 42:48.668
What are you doing?

42:48.692 --> 42:50.772
I'm, uh... I'm just going
to kick it here, all right?

43:01.872 --> 43:02.957
Sit.

43:31.235 --> 43:32.820
Will you quit being a creeper?

43:34.989 --> 43:38.075
What, are you going to tell me
I'm beautiful when I sleep?

43:40.119 --> 43:41.287
What's it mean?

43:41.370 --> 43:43.289
It means I was drunk in Cabo.

43:45.833 --> 43:46.834
Mmm.

43:47.543 --> 43:48.961
What does that mean?

43:56.760 --> 43:58.387
Why are you so cute
when you're jaded?

44:09.189 --> 44:11.025
I have this friend
that runs this gallery

44:11.150 --> 44:12.943
and it's...
It's pretty amazing.

44:13.027 --> 44:14.787
It's, like, exactly
the kind of stuff you do.

44:14.862 --> 44:17.281
I should kind of...
I really should introduce you.

44:18.324 --> 44:19.366
Maybe.

44:20.284 --> 44:21.910
Maybe?

44:23.704 --> 44:25.247
Hey, will you come
to Elysian with me?

44:26.206 --> 44:27.666
I don't know. Maybe.

44:29.168 --> 44:30.294
Come on.

44:32.046 --> 44:33.380
I've been
working on something.

44:35.049 --> 44:36.383
And I really want to show you.

44:36.467 --> 44:37.551
Yeah?

44:41.221 --> 44:43.349
Well, if you keep kissing me

44:44.641 --> 44:46.477
like that,

44:46.560 --> 44:48.103
maybe I will.

45:15.756 --> 45:16.956
What are you doing here?

45:21.470 --> 45:23.305
Don't take another step.

45:23.389 --> 45:25.099
Nobody invited you
in this house.

45:30.896 --> 45:33.857
I didn't come here to fight
with you, Francisco.

45:35.859 --> 45:37.152
Have you seen Danny?

45:39.446 --> 45:41.240
Look,
Gloria wants to know if he's

45:41.365 --> 45:43.117
coming to
Isabel's <i>quinceañera.</i>

45:44.201 --> 45:45.661
That's funny.

45:45.744 --> 45:47.955
Even sober, you can't
keep track of your kids.

45:48.997 --> 45:50.290
Tell that new wife of yours,

45:50.374 --> 45:52.960
thanks so much for getting
you all straightened up.

45:56.797 --> 45:58.006
Hey. Hey!

45:59.216 --> 46:00.884
I didn't stop for her!

46:01.969 --> 46:05.347
I stopped for
Danny and for you.

46:05.431 --> 46:06.682
I stopped for your mother.

46:09.351 --> 46:11.478
Don't talk about her.

46:12.146 --> 46:13.786
Because you don't know
anything about her.

46:14.523 --> 46:16.400
You were too busy
getting drunk,

46:16.483 --> 46:18.485
while she was
laying in the hospital.

46:19.153 --> 46:21.655
I had to take Danny
to see her every day. Not you.

46:22.448 --> 46:23.907
Do you know what
people call me now?

46:25.284 --> 46:26.660
What my own brother call me?

46:27.661 --> 46:29.163
"Ghost."

46:29.246 --> 46:30.446
You know why
they call me that?

46:31.206 --> 46:32.583
'Cause for
the last eight years,

46:32.666 --> 46:35.002
you haven't so much
as mentioned my name

46:35.085 --> 46:37.004
to remind people
that I exist.

46:37.087 --> 46:38.505
You wanna talk to me?

46:41.884 --> 46:43.677
Tell me why you
didn't visit me in prison.

46:46.013 --> 46:48.765
You're a joke.
And nothing changes.

47:19.963 --> 47:22.049
You know that
paint's gonna spill out

47:22.132 --> 47:23.509
if you don't stand
that hood up.

47:23.592 --> 47:25.135
My first time doing this shit.

47:25.219 --> 47:26.720
I... I didn't know.

47:31.558 --> 47:33.118
You want me to fill
in that ink for you?

47:37.022 --> 47:38.232
Yeah. All right.

47:41.235 --> 47:43.153
Why the blank face, anyway?

47:47.741 --> 47:49.243
Remember when, uh...

47:50.827 --> 47:52.162
When Pops was really bad?

47:53.205 --> 47:56.250
And we found him at the shop
with all the photos of Mom.

48:00.128 --> 48:01.338
He burned them all up.

48:13.600 --> 48:14.768
I can't remember her face.

48:27.614 --> 48:28.991
She was beautiful, bro.

48:30.242 --> 48:31.326
An angel.

48:32.911 --> 48:34.204
See, it's simple.

48:36.456 --> 48:38.000
She had two eyes.

48:42.296 --> 48:43.422
A nose.

48:48.302 --> 48:51.680
And a small dimple
when she smiled.

48:53.223 --> 48:54.474
But only on one side.

49:04.484 --> 49:07.237
Give it time.
It'll heal up good.

49:19.499 --> 49:21.209
<i>To be honest,</i>

49:21.293 --> 49:24.087
<i>I never knew why Elysian Park
was so important.</i>

49:24.171 --> 49:25.172
<i>Until now.</i>

49:28.008 --> 49:30.010
<i>Ghost told me back in the day,</i>

49:30.093 --> 49:31.678
<i>the cops saw us as outsiders.</i>

49:31.762 --> 49:34.431
<i>So they took the one thing
we used to express ourselves</i>

49:34.514 --> 49:35.849
<i>and outlawed it.</i>

49:37.934 --> 49:40.896
<i>But even though they
made lowriding illegal,</i>

49:40.979 --> 49:42.689
<i>it didn't stop us.</i>

49:42.773 --> 49:44.775
<i>We had gatherings all over LA.</i>

49:44.858 --> 49:47.277
<i>And the one place
they couldn't touch us?</i>

49:47.361 --> 49:48.487
<i>Elysian Park.</i>

49:48.570 --> 49:49.988
Hey, uh,
you're not bored, are you?

49:50.072 --> 49:53.408
Bored? No, no, I can't
wait to develop these.

50:06.546 --> 50:08.840
Well, it's a '61 Impala,
as you know,

50:08.924 --> 50:11.968
and the hydraulics, obviously.

50:12.052 --> 50:16.306
With a custom, uh,
green flake paint on the roof.

50:16.390 --> 50:19.309
Fully customized with the third
eye over there and, uh...

50:19.726 --> 50:22.688
If you need to see anything else,
let us know, all right?

50:22.771 --> 50:25.065
Oh! The, uh, mural...

50:26.233 --> 50:27.734
My father did it.

50:29.111 --> 50:31.571
But, uh, you probably
already know that, right?

50:35.951 --> 50:37.160
Thank you.

50:42.874 --> 50:44.000
You did good.

50:48.255 --> 50:51.174
Isabel? You know that
Miguel and I met here?

50:51.258 --> 50:52.551
Oh, my God, Mom.
I know.

50:52.634 --> 50:54.344
No, you don't know
everything.

50:54.428 --> 50:56.179
Back in the day,
I was a badass bitch.

50:56.263 --> 50:57.848
Mom!
Tell her, honey.

50:57.931 --> 50:59.224
What? Sorry.

50:59.307 --> 51:02.018
<i>Mira,</i> I know
you're worried.

51:02.644 --> 51:06.440
But you worked really hard.
Just try to relax and enjoy today, okay?

51:06.523 --> 51:08.066
Okay.
Yeah?

51:12.779 --> 51:16.116
If you two are done, come check
this shit out. All right?

51:16.199 --> 51:17.701
Bring that camera.
Come on.

51:17.784 --> 51:20.144
You're about to see all the work
your boy's been putting in.

51:20.871 --> 51:22.164
Chuy!

51:22.998 --> 51:25.751
Hey! What's up?
I like your hair. Hey.

51:26.752 --> 51:27.878
Here we go.

51:35.177 --> 51:37.053
All right.

51:38.263 --> 51:40.307
What? Are you serious?

51:42.392 --> 51:44.102
Oh, my God.
You like it?

51:44.186 --> 51:45.896
Whoa, slow down, tiger.

51:47.147 --> 51:49.566
Damn, this car is hard.

51:49.649 --> 51:50.817
What's up, Chuy?

51:50.942 --> 51:52.068
What's up, Danny?

51:52.152 --> 51:53.695
You killed it, bro.

51:55.572 --> 51:58.116
Oh, shit! Is that...
Is that you, girl?

51:58.200 --> 52:00.952
Damn! I didn't know
you had all that ass.

52:01.036 --> 52:02.287
Hey, what the...

52:02.370 --> 52:03.580
What?
"What?"

52:03.663 --> 52:05.099
It's not funny, you know?
Yeah. It is.

52:05.123 --> 52:06.517
Think 'cause your
hair's slicked back

52:06.541 --> 52:07.935
and you're kicking
it with my brother,

52:07.959 --> 52:09.085
you're some type of...

52:09.169 --> 52:10.295
Calm down.
No.

52:10.378 --> 52:13.256
Hey, calm down.
What are you doing? Relax. Relax.

52:13.673 --> 52:14.883
Relax!

52:14.966 --> 52:16.885
I don't have to
take this shit!

52:16.968 --> 52:20.597
Relax. Chuyito is
the new Central City mascot.

52:20.680 --> 52:22.724
Got a little fire in him now.

52:22.808 --> 52:24.851
Hey, see that?

52:26.520 --> 52:31.274
Let's go show old school what
he's up against. All right?

52:37.280 --> 52:41.243
<i>To win best in show, your
whole car's got to be complete.</i>

52:41.326 --> 52:43.245
<i>Judges look at everything.</i>

52:43.328 --> 52:47.332
<i>Depending on the make, model,
year, they look at the rims,</i>

52:47.415 --> 52:49.084
<i>the paint job, the hydraulics.</i>

52:49.167 --> 52:50.752
<i>Everything's got to be custom.</i>

52:50.836 --> 52:52.629
- Little D?
<i>- Chromed out.</i>

52:52.712 --> 52:53.839
Go, please, go...

52:53.922 --> 52:55.549
<i>But the thing that makes it</i>

52:55.632 --> 52:57.884
<i>the most unique
are the murals.</i>

52:58.718 --> 53:01.054
<i>They are all one of a kind.</i>

53:02.389 --> 53:03.723
<i>Shit, I hope they like mine.</i>

54:00.447 --> 54:02.842
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, thank you for coming out</i>

54:02.866 --> 54:05.160
<i>on this beautiful
Southern California day!</i>

54:05.243 --> 54:06.578
Yeah!

54:06.661 --> 54:09.456
And now for the moment
we've all been waiting for!

54:09.706 --> 54:13.710
Winner of best in show,
grand prize of $10,000!

54:15.462 --> 54:16.963
And, this is new!

54:17.297 --> 54:20.508
An exclusive invite
to Big Chele International!

54:22.427 --> 54:23.595
You guys ready?

54:23.678 --> 54:24.888
Yeah!

54:26.723 --> 54:29.684
The Coasters! Green Poison!

54:30.977 --> 54:33.063
Bullshit! We the best
and you all know it.

54:49.037 --> 54:51.122
I'm going to go congratulate
him. I'll be back.

54:52.999 --> 54:54.084
Let's go.

54:54.167 --> 54:57.087
That's how we do it.

54:57.170 --> 54:58.713
Get in the car. We out.

54:58.964 --> 55:00.590
I want to go
congratulate him.

55:01.508 --> 55:02.968
Get in the car.

55:50.557 --> 55:51.975
<i>Chiquita!</i>

55:52.058 --> 55:53.226
Shh! Miguel!

55:56.062 --> 55:58.064
- We won, <i>mi amor!</i>
- Stop!

55:58.898 --> 56:00.942
I don't want Isabel
to see you like this!

56:01.484 --> 56:03.069
We're celebrating!

56:04.154 --> 56:05.405
Yeah, I can see.

56:09.159 --> 56:12.454
Why don't you just stop
giving me shit for one minute?

56:13.747 --> 56:16.958
Hmm? We won!
Now we have money.

56:17.042 --> 56:20.670
Now we can pay for those bills
and for the party you want!

56:22.088 --> 56:23.840
Do you want to talk
about what I want?

56:24.549 --> 56:26.676
Let me tell you what I want, Miguel.
Yeah. Please.

56:27.427 --> 56:29.262
I want you to
talk to somebody.

56:29.637 --> 56:30.805
Anybody!

56:31.514 --> 56:32.766
Talk to me!

56:33.016 --> 56:34.184
Or your sons.

56:34.267 --> 56:36.061
I can't talk to my sons!

56:38.021 --> 56:39.147
I try!

56:41.399 --> 56:44.277
They just don't want
anything to do with me.

56:51.701 --> 56:52.786
Miguel.

56:55.330 --> 56:57.457
But when it's your kids,
you shouldn't stop trying.

57:04.631 --> 57:05.882
Are you coming?

57:43.837 --> 57:45.296
Come with me.

57:45.421 --> 57:46.840
Where are we going?

57:46.923 --> 57:48.508
My friend that
I told you about

57:48.633 --> 57:50.176
who runs the gallery.
He's here.

57:50.510 --> 57:52.554
Right now? Now?
Yes! Right now.

57:52.637 --> 57:54.347
What's his name again?
Marc.

57:55.056 --> 57:56.141
Marc.

57:56.266 --> 57:57.308
Ah! Lorelei.

57:57.392 --> 57:58.518
This is Danny.

57:58.643 --> 57:59.769
How are you doing?

57:59.853 --> 58:01.479
I'm good.
Thank you. Hi.

58:01.688 --> 58:04.149
I was... I was just
telling him about how

58:04.274 --> 58:06.734
you've always
championed street artists.

58:06.818 --> 58:10.071
And I think that Danny is...
Is really special.

58:10.155 --> 58:12.240
Okay.
I just work on cars.

58:12.323 --> 58:13.491
Danny...

58:13.575 --> 58:15.952
Well, one of his
many mediums

58:16.035 --> 58:17.996
is creating lowriders.
Mmm-hmm.

58:18.538 --> 58:20.165
Look.
Ah.

58:20.748 --> 58:23.001
See? Aren't they unbelievable?

58:23.084 --> 58:24.210
Hmm.

58:24.294 --> 58:26.379
I mean, he was completely
self-taught in the streets.

58:26.462 --> 58:27.463
I ain't homeless.

58:27.547 --> 58:28.627
Well, you know what I mean.

58:30.884 --> 58:32.969
Oh.
Um, I love that one.

58:33.052 --> 58:34.929
What is the meaning of...
Of, uh,

58:35.597 --> 58:38.183
keeping
the portraits faceless?

58:38.266 --> 58:39.809
Why? Why is that?

58:42.228 --> 58:43.438
I don't know.

58:43.521 --> 58:46.107
You're so cute when you're
trying to be mysterious.

58:46.191 --> 58:47.525
I'm not trying
to be anything.

58:47.609 --> 58:50.737
You see, all of his
work is based on women.

58:50.820 --> 58:56.075
Either a woman's hand or a faceless
depiction of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

58:56.534 --> 58:58.912
It's so poignant.

58:58.995 --> 59:01.998
He pulls from all of this
traditional Mexican imagery,

59:02.081 --> 59:04.667
but at the same time,
he doesn't particularly celebrate it.

59:04.751 --> 59:08.379
You know, the... The emptiness,
the lack of identity.

59:08.463 --> 59:09.714
It's... It's...

59:09.923 --> 59:12.508
As if, you know, he's...
He's here,

59:12.592 --> 59:15.220
but America hasn't
accepted all of him.

59:15.303 --> 59:19.557
Oh. Okay. I think it's, uh...
I think it's really great.

59:19.641 --> 59:20.725
Hmm.

59:20.808 --> 59:22.769
I would love to find
some time to sit down

59:22.936 --> 59:24.896
and... And look at
these a little more.

59:24.979 --> 59:26.272
Yes.
Yeah.

59:27.899 --> 59:28.918
It's very nice
to meet you.

59:28.942 --> 59:29.943
You too.

59:30.526 --> 59:32.237
I always love to see you.
Okay.

59:32.320 --> 59:33.571
Yes, me too.

59:36.658 --> 59:38.201
That went really well.

59:40.620 --> 59:41.955
Where is he from?

01:00:10.108 --> 01:00:12.402
Hey. Keep a lookout.

01:00:12.485 --> 01:00:14.112
Come on. Hurry up.

01:00:34.132 --> 01:00:36.843
What the...
What are you doing?

01:00:41.848 --> 01:00:43.141
Back up off him!

01:00:43.224 --> 01:00:45.476
He ain't gonna do shit!
Let's just go.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.812
What are you doing here?
What do you want?

01:00:47.895 --> 01:00:49.397
Hey, man, just let's go!

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:57.238
No. No, no, no. No, please!
Please stop! I beg you!

01:00:57.322 --> 01:01:00.366
No! No! Stop!

01:01:08.833 --> 01:01:10.084
Hurry up.

01:01:22.513 --> 01:01:23.890
Call 911.

01:01:29.228 --> 01:01:31.105
Yeah. Someone's been shot!

01:01:33.316 --> 01:01:35.276
Yeah, someone's been shot!

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.953
So, that's great, right?

01:01:46.621 --> 01:01:48.247
That Marc wants
to see your stuff?

01:01:50.666 --> 01:01:52.251
Yeah. It's cool.

01:01:56.547 --> 01:01:58.758
You really think
that's what my shit's about?

01:02:01.594 --> 01:02:03.137
Rejecting where I come from?

01:02:03.262 --> 01:02:04.806
That's not what I'm saying.

01:02:04.889 --> 01:02:08.393
I'm... I'm just saying,
it doesn't exactly celebrate it.

01:02:08.476 --> 01:02:11.687
And I mean, I...
I know you. So...

01:02:15.733 --> 01:02:17.693
You don't know shit
about me, Lorelei.

01:02:17.777 --> 01:02:19.278
That's why you
follow me around

01:02:19.362 --> 01:02:21.739
taking photos of shit
you know nothing about.

01:02:21.823 --> 01:02:23.783
You think because
you got a fancy loft

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:27.495
and your fishnets are torn
makes you unique? It doesn't.

01:02:28.162 --> 01:02:29.372
And when you can admit that,

01:02:29.455 --> 01:02:31.499
then you can start talking
to me about my culture.

01:02:31.582 --> 01:02:33.876
Well, you're the guy who doesn't
want to sell out, right?

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:36.546
You'll climb some
building and risk your life

01:02:36.629 --> 01:02:39.424
because your art doesn't need
a gallery or a price tag.

01:02:39.507 --> 01:02:40.967
No, you just need an audience.

01:02:43.094 --> 01:02:44.429
Well, let me
tell you something.

01:02:44.512 --> 01:02:47.598
Famous graffiti artists are
in galleries and on bridges.

01:02:47.682 --> 01:02:50.226
You don't have to
be poor to be real.

01:02:50.643 --> 01:02:52.162
But you do have to
put your art somewhere

01:02:52.186 --> 01:02:54.730
where people can actually tell
you what they think about it.

01:02:54.814 --> 01:02:57.859
Not just on some car!
Art is a conversation.

01:02:57.942 --> 01:03:00.653
And yours is a little one-sided,
because you're so afraid

01:03:00.736 --> 01:03:02.363
of what people
are going to say.

01:03:15.168 --> 01:03:16.502
You're right.

01:03:18.087 --> 01:03:19.589
You're right.

01:03:36.689 --> 01:03:38.024
Gloria.

01:03:41.027 --> 01:03:43.070
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down. What are you...

01:03:48.201 --> 01:03:49.619
Gloria?
Danny?

01:03:49.994 --> 01:03:51.037
What happened?

01:03:52.288 --> 01:03:54.916
They shot him!
They shot him!

01:03:55.041 --> 01:03:56.977
What's wrong? What are you talking about?
Who shot him?

01:03:57.001 --> 01:03:58.437
I don't know! What do you
mean, you don't know?

01:03:58.461 --> 01:04:00.147
What did they say?
Is he okay? He's in surgery.

01:04:00.171 --> 01:04:02.465
And they're not gonna know
anything until tomorrow.

01:04:04.091 --> 01:04:06.636
Gomez. Do you mind taking
Mrs. Alvarez for some coffee?

01:04:06.719 --> 01:04:08.429
Yeah. No, I want to
stay, I gotta stay.

01:04:08.513 --> 01:04:10.199
I... I just need to
ask Danny some questions.

01:04:10.223 --> 01:04:11.807
Just a few questions.

01:04:11.891 --> 01:04:13.327
It's fine. Look, let me
just talk to him. Okay?

01:04:13.351 --> 01:04:15.061
I'm not gonna go anywhere,
I promise.

01:04:15.311 --> 01:04:16.729
Okay.

01:04:26.489 --> 01:04:28.074
We, uh, found that.

01:04:35.623 --> 01:04:38.084
I'm sorry to have to ask you
these questions now.

01:04:39.168 --> 01:04:40.753
But it's important.

01:04:44.173 --> 01:04:45.591
It's... It's fine.
I guess it...

01:04:47.802 --> 01:04:49.637
Yeah? Okay.

01:04:50.471 --> 01:04:52.473
So, when's the last time
you saw your brother?

01:05:03.568 --> 01:05:04.694
Ghost!

01:05:05.528 --> 01:05:07.113
Oh, shit, Little D!

01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:09.410
I was wondering when we was
gonna see you again.

01:05:09.448 --> 01:05:10.616
Fuck you!

01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:12.380
What'd you say, son?
You heard what I said!

01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:13.452
Bitch!

01:05:18.583 --> 01:05:21.377
Where you think you're at?
Huh, homie?

01:05:22.628 --> 01:05:24.463
After everything
I've done for you.

01:05:28.092 --> 01:05:29.510
Why'd you do it?

01:05:30.261 --> 01:05:32.430
Say it! Be a man!

01:05:39.979 --> 01:05:41.439
Yeah, Little D!

01:05:43.816 --> 01:05:45.943
What do you want me to say?
Hmm?

01:05:47.278 --> 01:05:48.988
That he wasn't
supposed to be there?

01:05:50.573 --> 01:05:52.241
Maybe your pops
is drinking again.

01:05:52.325 --> 01:05:53.367
He's your pops, too!

01:05:53.492 --> 01:05:54.493
He ain't shit to me!

01:05:55.369 --> 01:05:58.956
You think you know what it was like?
'Cause you was there?

01:06:00.082 --> 01:06:01.375
You don't know!

01:06:01.459 --> 01:06:03.586
Drinking and disappearing

01:06:03.669 --> 01:06:05.671
and beating me for
looking at him wrong?

01:06:05.755 --> 01:06:09.133
You ain't know about that 'cause
I took my beatings and yours.

01:06:09.675 --> 01:06:11.510
That <i>puta</i> deserves
to die.

01:06:12.637 --> 01:06:15.389
'Cause it should
be him, and not Mom.

01:06:17.933 --> 01:06:19.268
Like I said...

01:06:20.519 --> 01:06:22.688
I ain't the one
that shot your pops.

01:06:44.669 --> 01:06:47.088
Maybe I shouldn't have taken
your beatings after all.

01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:51.050
Maybe you wouldn't fight
like such a little bitch.

01:06:54.178 --> 01:06:55.554
We're done.

01:06:57.223 --> 01:06:58.891
Get this fool out of here!

01:06:58.974 --> 01:07:00.601
Come on. Hey!

01:07:19.578 --> 01:07:21.497
Okay. Thank you.

01:07:24.583 --> 01:07:25.918
Danny? Hey.

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.590
How is he?
Is he awake?

01:07:31.674 --> 01:07:33.342
Yeah. Just in time.

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:35.177
He needs you.

01:07:51.569 --> 01:07:53.404
<i>Amor?</i>
Huh?

01:07:53.487 --> 01:07:55.072
Guess who's here
to see you.

01:07:55.156 --> 01:07:56.282
Huh?

01:08:00.453 --> 01:08:01.787
Hey.

01:08:04.707 --> 01:08:05.958
I'll be back.

01:08:19.471 --> 01:08:20.680
Chuy, uh...

01:08:22.349 --> 01:08:23.809
Chuy told me everything.

01:08:25.603 --> 01:08:28.439
He said that it was
all Ghost's idea and I...

01:08:28.522 --> 01:08:29.899
I think we should go
to the cops.

01:08:29.982 --> 01:08:31.066
No.

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:32.609
But they destroyed
Green Poison.

01:08:33.277 --> 01:08:35.488
We don't have
a car for Big Chele.

01:08:42.661 --> 01:08:44.747
You know, I don't understand
anything about you.

01:08:47.332 --> 01:08:48.501
Dad, you could have died.

01:08:48.626 --> 01:08:49.752
Yeah, but I didn't.

01:08:49.835 --> 01:08:51.462
But you can't let
them do this to you.

01:08:51.545 --> 01:08:53.339
I said no, Danny!

01:08:54.673 --> 01:08:56.425
I don't want to
be a part of...

01:08:58.176 --> 01:09:00.011
Francisco going back to jail.

01:09:01.889 --> 01:09:03.390
No cops.

01:09:12.942 --> 01:09:14.777
They found this at the shop.

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:15.944
Huh?

01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:20.866
What is it?

01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:26.497
It's your AA sobriety coin.

01:09:31.126 --> 01:09:34.129
I haven't done much
to deserve it lately.

01:09:35.130 --> 01:09:36.715
Put it in my wallet, please.

01:10:06.662 --> 01:10:08.455
First time I saw her,

01:10:08.831 --> 01:10:10.374
I remember thinking,

01:10:11.417 --> 01:10:13.586
"This woman is perfect."

01:10:22.511 --> 01:10:25.389
All I ever cared
about was cars.

01:10:26.015 --> 01:10:29.226
I always wanted to
build a better car.

01:10:30.686 --> 01:10:32.813
More beautiful than the last.

01:10:34.565 --> 01:10:36.483
When I met your mother,

01:10:36.567 --> 01:10:38.027
I thought,

01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:40.446
"It doesn't matter
how hard I try."

01:10:42.531 --> 01:10:44.867
"I will never be
able to build a car"

01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:46.952
"as beautiful as this woman."

01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:55.294
Keep it, son.

01:11:02.801 --> 01:11:04.303
You keep it.

01:11:41.256 --> 01:11:42.841
Danny?

01:11:45.094 --> 01:11:47.846
Hey, I heard about your dad.
I just...

01:11:48.806 --> 01:11:51.600
I just wanted to stop by and
say that I was sorry and...

01:11:51.684 --> 01:11:53.811
You know, I'm here for you
if you need anything.

01:11:54.937 --> 01:11:57.439
I'm pretty sure
that I'm the one

01:11:57.523 --> 01:11:59.316
that should be
saying sorry, though.

01:12:03.445 --> 01:12:05.322
It's fine.
We're friends.

01:12:09.284 --> 01:12:10.786
Aren't you leaving soon?

01:12:14.081 --> 01:12:16.542
I don't know. I'm...
I might not even go.

01:12:18.043 --> 01:12:19.712
What are you
talking about?

01:12:19.795 --> 01:12:21.380
You have a scholarship.

01:12:21.922 --> 01:12:23.507
I might just stay here

01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:25.718
for a couple of
years and take classes.

01:12:25.968 --> 01:12:27.553
You know what I think?

01:12:29.805 --> 01:12:31.574
I think you need to
quit being a little bitch.

01:12:33.058 --> 01:12:36.311
I need to quit being a little bitch?
Okay, what about you, huh?

01:12:36.395 --> 01:12:39.481
Okay. I might not be the
artsy girl, but that mural?

01:12:39.565 --> 01:12:40.816
It could have been
a lot better.

01:12:40.899 --> 01:12:43.068
Oh...

01:12:45.112 --> 01:12:46.155
That's how you feel?

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.322
Mmm-hmm.

01:12:48.782 --> 01:12:50.159
No, but seriously.

01:12:51.535 --> 01:12:52.953
Forget about what
your dad's saying.

01:12:53.037 --> 01:12:54.496
Forget about
your brother.

01:12:56.749 --> 01:12:58.417
You need to keep
doing your own thing.

01:13:00.377 --> 01:13:02.421
I always thought
that was cool about you.

01:13:07.718 --> 01:13:09.094
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:13:09.178 --> 01:13:10.471
Angel?

01:13:10.721 --> 01:13:12.514
Hey.
What are you doing tomorrow?

01:13:13.849 --> 01:13:16.060
I know we've got a few
weeks left for Big Chele.

01:13:16.143 --> 01:13:19.146
And this might be impossible,
but we gotta try, right?

01:13:21.315 --> 01:13:24.026
Gonna need a miracle to put
this baby back together.

01:13:25.569 --> 01:13:27.279
Yeah, I know
it's not much,

01:13:27.696 --> 01:13:29.281
but imagine her,
with 50 coats?

01:13:30.699 --> 01:13:31.909
Sitting on zeniths?

01:13:34.078 --> 01:13:35.412
Yeah.

01:13:38.624 --> 01:13:39.917
Let's do it.

01:13:40.042 --> 01:13:41.293
Let's do it.

01:13:49.009 --> 01:13:51.136
<i>Shows like
the Big Chele Invitational,</i>

01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:52.888
<i>they're nothing like Elysian.</i>

01:13:52.971 --> 01:13:55.599
<i>They're private events
for high-end buyers and press.</i>

01:13:55.682 --> 01:13:59.770
<i>Shit. No one here has ever been to one.
But we've heard about them.</i>

01:13:59.853 --> 01:14:02.231
Yo, Angel! What are you doing?
You're gonna bend it!

01:14:02.731 --> 01:14:04.775
You gotta take the bracket
off the frame first!

01:14:04.858 --> 01:14:07.903
Hey, relax, dawg. Come on, you're
starting to sound like your old man.

01:14:07.986 --> 01:14:10.114
Here, you want to do it?
Let me try, come on.

01:14:10.197 --> 01:14:12.991
Hey, get up out of here, dawg.
Come on, homie, I got this.

01:14:16.829 --> 01:14:19.665
<i>It's about half a dozen
of the most elite cars</i>

01:14:19.748 --> 01:14:21.959
<i>in the world, in one room.</i>

01:14:22.042 --> 01:14:24.503
<i>And getting a ticket is
no small thing either.</i>

01:14:26.213 --> 01:14:28.090
<i>If you're the lucky one
in the group,</i>

01:14:28.173 --> 01:14:30.509
<i>you might be able sell your
ride for, like, half a million</i>

01:14:30.592 --> 01:14:32.094
<i>and get tons of press.</i>

01:14:32.177 --> 01:14:34.638
Yeah. Could you check
on that part for me, please?

01:14:41.186 --> 01:14:43.856
Hey! Danny! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing, man?

01:14:44.481 --> 01:14:45.899
We're gonna need an interior.

01:15:10.215 --> 01:15:11.550
Hey, <i>mijo.</i>

01:15:14.178 --> 01:15:15.888
Did you eat yet?
I saved you a plate.

01:15:16.847 --> 01:15:17.890
I already ate.

01:15:18.015 --> 01:15:19.057
Oh.

01:15:19.391 --> 01:15:22.853
You look tired.
How's the car coming along?

01:15:23.729 --> 01:15:25.981
It's coming along.
Little by little.

01:15:26.773 --> 01:15:28.150
Have you named it yet?

01:15:28.859 --> 01:15:29.985
No.

01:15:32.905 --> 01:15:34.531
Why don't you name it
after your mom?

01:15:35.157 --> 01:15:36.575
"Marisol"?

01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:39.661
From here?

01:15:39.745 --> 01:15:41.014
Yeah, don't put your
hand on the bottom of it.

01:15:41.038 --> 01:15:42.724
<i>People think that
lowriders are just something</i>

01:15:42.748 --> 01:15:44.041
<i>that happens in East LA.</i>

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:46.543
<i>But there are
thousands of clubs</i>

01:15:46.627 --> 01:15:48.962
<i>just like my dad's,
all over the world.</i>

01:15:49.046 --> 01:15:50.422
<i>And they come here.</i>

01:15:50.505 --> 01:15:53.091
<i>Because this is
where it all started.</i>

01:15:55.719 --> 01:15:59.431
<i>I think it's time for the
Alvarez family to represent.</i>

01:16:07.606 --> 01:16:09.233
Ghost?

01:16:10.275 --> 01:16:11.735
Hey, listen, man.

01:16:13.403 --> 01:16:15.530
I really think you
should talk to Pops.

01:16:17.491 --> 01:16:19.785
He's about to get
out of the hospital.

01:16:23.747 --> 01:16:27.459
<i>I came by your place,
but you were already gone.</i>

01:16:27.542 --> 01:16:29.628
<i>I know the cops
are looking for you,</i>

01:16:30.295 --> 01:16:33.215
<i>so I guess that probably means
I won't see you for a while.</i>

01:16:34.049 --> 01:16:35.759
<i>Anyways, man...</i>

01:16:36.093 --> 01:16:37.636
<i>Pops really misses you,</i>

01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:39.346
<i>and so do I.</i>

01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:49.064
What are we doing here?

01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:50.291
I just want
to show you something.

01:16:50.315 --> 01:16:51.608
Oh. What is it?

01:16:51.733 --> 01:16:52.985
I'll show you.

01:17:12.379 --> 01:17:13.922
Whoa!

01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:21.263
I couldn't let the Big
Chele ticket go to waste.

01:17:21.346 --> 01:17:22.848
Whoa!

01:17:23.682 --> 01:17:26.101
Wow! <i>Mijo,</i> it's...

01:17:43.535 --> 01:17:44.745
What's wrong?

01:17:52.961 --> 01:17:54.588
I'm sorry I never

01:17:56.214 --> 01:17:59.634
let you paint a mural
on these cars before.

01:18:01.219 --> 01:18:02.721
You know...

01:18:04.514 --> 01:18:08.101
One day I passed under one of
your tags you got busted for,

01:18:09.728 --> 01:18:11.438
right on the freeway.

01:18:12.397 --> 01:18:14.483
I was sitting in traffic

01:18:14.941 --> 01:18:17.569
and I saw all these people
around me looking at it.

01:18:19.654 --> 01:18:22.532
It reminded me how I felt
when I was lowriding.

01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:32.334
That's how I met your mom.

01:18:34.169 --> 01:18:36.421
Cruising down the boulevard.

01:18:40.092 --> 01:18:42.469
That's all any
of this was about.

01:18:43.053 --> 01:18:45.055
When you look back
to the beginning...

01:18:55.774 --> 01:18:59.486
<i>It started in every
town in Mexico with the paseo.</i>

01:18:59.569 --> 01:19:02.406
<i>Boys would parade
through their villages</i>

01:19:03.115 --> 01:19:04.699
<i>to get the girls' attention.</i>

01:19:06.952 --> 01:19:09.579
<i>And when the Old
World came to the New,</i>

01:19:10.622 --> 01:19:13.458
<i>that became strutting Chevys
down the boulevard.</i>

01:19:15.001 --> 01:19:18.380
<i>We took the American dream
and covered it with candy,</i>

01:19:18.463 --> 01:19:20.298
<i>paint and chrome.</i>

01:19:24.177 --> 01:19:27.222
<i>But people don't like the
American dream to look different.</i>

01:19:28.890 --> 01:19:31.059
<i>So they outlawed any vehicle</i>

01:19:31.143 --> 01:19:34.479
<i>whose body was lower than the
bottom of the wheel's rim.</i>

01:19:38.650 --> 01:19:40.652
<i>Some traditions,
you have to take 'em with you,</i>

01:19:40.735 --> 01:19:41.820
<i>no matter what.</i>

01:19:44.698 --> 01:19:46.408
<i>They're in your blood.</i>

01:19:46.491 --> 01:19:48.577
<i>They're part of you.</i>

01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:57.794
<i>So, we took hydraulics
out of fighterjets.</i>

01:19:59.212 --> 01:20:01.798
See a cop, raise it up!

01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:10.098
Pass a cop, drop it back down.

01:20:31.661 --> 01:20:33.371
Think Mom would like it?

01:20:59.397 --> 01:21:02.150
<i>Welcome to
the Big Chele Invitational!</i>

01:21:24.506 --> 01:21:27.133
Hey, what's up, man? You don't
take no time off or what?

01:21:27.217 --> 01:21:28.843
- You like it?
- It's all right.

01:21:28.927 --> 01:21:30.971
"All right"? Come on.
No, I'm proud of it.

01:21:31.054 --> 01:21:32.430
Yo, the five-o.

01:21:33.682 --> 01:21:34.891
Good luck tonight, Danny.

01:21:36.601 --> 01:21:37.686
Thank you.

01:21:38.895 --> 01:21:40.939
Mr. Alvarez. Hi.
Hello, Detective.

01:21:42.732 --> 01:21:44.734
Looking good.
Thank you.

01:21:53.994 --> 01:21:56.496
You don't think Ghost
would show up, do you?

01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:59.040
I don't know.

01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:01.334
I hope not.

01:22:29.446 --> 01:22:31.781
Excuse me,
is this your car?

01:22:32.741 --> 01:22:33.908
My son built it.

01:22:35.744 --> 01:22:37.621
How much?

01:22:37.996 --> 01:22:39.205
To buy it?

01:22:39.873 --> 01:22:41.333
I'm sorry,
it's not for sale.

01:22:41.583 --> 01:22:44.919
If you could name a price,
any price...

01:22:45.003 --> 01:22:47.339
I will write
a check right now.

01:23:23.166 --> 01:23:26.211
Francisco, what are you doing?
The police are here.

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:29.214
I don't give a shit
about the cops.

01:23:29.547 --> 01:23:31.549
You think I got
something to lose?

01:23:31.633 --> 01:23:32.993
They're gonna
arrest me either way.

01:23:33.218 --> 01:23:35.053
It doesn't have
to be that way.

01:23:35.428 --> 01:23:37.013
I don't want to
lose you again.

01:23:37.931 --> 01:23:39.808
I want you to tell me why.

01:23:41.059 --> 01:23:42.811
Why you never
came to see me.

01:23:42.894 --> 01:23:44.646
I already told you,
Francisco.

01:23:44.729 --> 01:23:46.523
That's not good enough.

01:23:53.571 --> 01:23:58.368
I didn't... I didn't come
because I was ashamed.

01:23:59.202 --> 01:24:00.578
Stop bullshitting me!

01:24:00.662 --> 01:24:03.039
Not of you. Of myself.

01:24:05.834 --> 01:24:07.001
Listen to me.

01:24:09.587 --> 01:24:11.589
This is my family's ride.

01:24:11.756 --> 01:24:13.049
Sorry, it ain't for sale.

01:24:19.639 --> 01:24:21.349
I understand.

01:24:23.143 --> 01:24:24.352
Thank you.

01:24:24.477 --> 01:24:25.729
Thank you.

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:53.757
Take it easy. No, no. No, no!
You don't know.

01:24:54.966 --> 01:24:56.593
No! We can't leave him alone!

01:25:07.479 --> 01:25:09.522
Ghost.
Get out.

01:25:09.606 --> 01:25:11.357
You're my brother.
I'm not gonna leave you.

01:25:32.545 --> 01:25:34.172
Oh, shit!

01:25:36.257 --> 01:25:38.802
Look, Ghost, it's not too late, man!
Just pull over!

01:25:39.135 --> 01:25:41.095
Why didn't you
just listen to me?

01:25:41.179 --> 01:25:42.680
I told you to get out.

01:25:44.349 --> 01:25:46.184
We need to get
over the bridge.

01:25:55.068 --> 01:25:56.861
Oh, shit!

01:26:24.556 --> 01:26:26.057
Oh, shit!

01:26:41.573 --> 01:26:44.293
<i>Freeze! Get
your hands where I can see them.</i>

01:26:48.246 --> 01:26:51.207
<i>Driver and passenger!
Get your hands where I can see them!</i>

01:26:54.252 --> 01:26:57.714
<i>Driver. Take the keys and put
them outside the window.</i>

01:26:58.756 --> 01:27:01.092
<i>Driver,
I will not repeat myself.</i>

01:27:07.265 --> 01:27:09.434
This is where you
get out, brother.

01:27:10.393 --> 01:27:11.477
No.

01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:14.439
You gotta take care of
yourself now, Danny. No.

01:27:15.690 --> 01:27:18.484
Ghost, no.
Don't do this! Please, don't!

01:27:26.784 --> 01:27:27.952
Come here.

01:27:29.454 --> 01:27:31.581
Ghost, don't do this!
Come on, don't do this.

01:27:31.664 --> 01:27:33.541
You don't have to do this.
Please, Ghost!

01:27:34.417 --> 01:27:35.835
But you gotta get out.

01:27:38.796 --> 01:27:40.465
Go. Get out.

01:27:42.592 --> 01:27:44.177
It's all good.

01:27:50.934 --> 01:27:53.144
<i>Slowly get down
on the ground, sir!</i>

01:27:59.150 --> 01:28:01.319
<i>Slowly get down on the ground!</i>

01:28:01.569 --> 01:28:03.988
<i>Put your hands up
where we can see them!</i>

01:28:09.619 --> 01:28:12.497
<i>Driver, get on your knees
and put your hands up!</i>

01:28:19.629 --> 01:28:22.131
<i>Driver, put your hands up,
behind your head!</i>

01:28:22.215 --> 01:28:23.841
<i>Interlock your fingers!</i>

01:28:26.678 --> 01:28:28.596
<i>Driver, put your hands up!</i>

01:28:29.806 --> 01:28:32.433
<i>Driver! Put your
hands above your head!</i>

01:28:33.184 --> 01:28:36.479
<i>Do not take one more step forward,
sir, or I will shoot you!</i>

01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:48.950
I didn't come to see you
because I was a coward.

01:28:50.785 --> 01:28:52.370
I was afraid.

01:28:59.585 --> 01:29:01.129
I'm right here.

01:29:02.755 --> 01:29:04.257
I'm sorry, son.

01:29:06.384 --> 01:29:09.971
Please... Forgive me.

01:29:34.996 --> 01:29:36.831
<i>Holy Mary, mother of God.</i>

01:29:37.707 --> 01:29:40.835
<i>Pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.</i>

01:29:41.753 --> 01:29:42.879
Amen.

01:29:45.923 --> 01:29:48.301
I know I haven't
talked to you in a while.

01:29:50.094 --> 01:29:52.305
I guess I just
didn't know what to say.

01:29:53.222 --> 01:29:54.932
And everything was
kind of messed up.

01:29:56.893 --> 01:29:58.811
The day of the
Big Chele show

01:30:00.104 --> 01:30:01.564
changed my life.

01:30:03.232 --> 01:30:06.402
<i>The car that we named
after you, people loved it.</i>

01:30:06.486 --> 01:30:08.738
<i>And we got some
pretty big offers.</i>

01:30:08.821 --> 01:30:11.407
<i>I thought it should
stay in the family.</i>

01:30:11.491 --> 01:30:13.451
<i>And Pops...</i>

01:30:13.701 --> 01:30:15.620
<i>Pops got crazy work.</i>

01:30:16.162 --> 01:30:18.998
<i>He even hired Chuy full-time.</i>

01:30:21.417 --> 01:30:23.044
<i>And the best part,</i>

01:30:23.419 --> 01:30:26.380
<i>people from all over are paying
me to paint their lowriders.</i>

01:30:26.464 --> 01:30:28.633
<i>I guess I'm
a full-time artist now.</i>

01:30:29.509 --> 01:30:31.552
<i>Just like you thought
I'd always be.</i>

01:30:32.804 --> 01:30:35.723
<i>Who would have thought
I'd be working with Pops</i>

01:30:35.807 --> 01:30:37.767
<i>and be doing what I love?</i>

01:30:38.476 --> 01:30:40.478
I just wish you
were here to see it.

01:30:41.813 --> 01:30:43.648
I hope I make you proud.

01:30:44.899 --> 01:30:46.234
I love you, Mom.

01:31:12.677 --> 01:31:13.678
Selfie!

01:31:18.224 --> 01:31:19.784
There you go.
I got it. Okay. All right.

01:31:24.147 --> 01:31:26.566
You look so pretty!

01:31:26.649 --> 01:31:28.693
Oh, my God!

01:31:28.776 --> 01:31:31.154
Okay, guys, come on,
we got to take a photo.

01:31:31.237 --> 01:31:34.115
We better hurry,
the sun is going down!

01:31:34.198 --> 01:31:35.449
Where are we gonna go?

01:31:35.575 --> 01:31:36.826
Right here.

01:31:36.909 --> 01:31:38.452
Okay, guys,
we're gonna go over here.

01:31:38.578 --> 01:31:40.121
We're gonna go right there.

01:31:40.204 --> 01:31:42.015
- All the way down?
- I know, I know, I'm sorry.

01:31:42.039 --> 01:31:43.350
You two look cute together.

01:31:43.374 --> 01:31:45.227
- Where do you think is a good spot?
- Right here.

01:31:45.251 --> 01:31:47.336
Turn around right there. Oh!

01:31:48.379 --> 01:31:50.590
I love you.
You know that, right?

01:31:54.302 --> 01:31:56.304
Do you love me
more than your Chevy?

01:31:56.387 --> 01:31:57.388
Oh!

01:32:00.224 --> 01:32:01.225
Mmm.

01:33:20.972 --> 01:33:22.515
Hello, son.
