(mellow music playing)

01:08.333 --> 01:11.633
Ma, did you have a sardine sandwich
for lunch again?

01:14.667 --> 01:16.000
Dreyfuss.

01:17.567 --> 01:20.400
Ma, what the hell is
Dreyfuss doing here?

01:20.467 --> 01:22.533
Calm down. I just ran into Harry Weston.

01:22.600 --> 01:26.166
They're leaving town.
I volunteered to watch Dreyfuss.

01:26.233 --> 01:27.567
Well, unvolunteer.

01:28.467 --> 01:30.767
Why? You think I can't do it?
I'm irresponsible?

01:30.834 --> 01:32.467
-Yes, ma.
-And forgetful?

01:32.533 --> 01:34.200
-Yes, ma.
-And irresponsible?

01:34.266 --> 01:35.900
You already said that.

01:36.867 --> 01:39.867
That's emphasis. You never heard the "I
have a dream" speech?

01:40.800 --> 01:43.367
Ma, face it. You cannot be trusted.

01:43.433 --> 01:45.600
Every time you get into
something like this,

01:45.667 --> 01:47.533
I have to end up covering for you.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.800
I'm not going to
take care of this dog.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.467
Did I ever mention
that I almost died giving birth to you?

01:57.367 --> 02:00.500
It was so painful they gave me
a towel to bite on.

02:00.567 --> 02:03.000
They gave you a towel at the hospital?

02:03.066 --> 02:06.867
What hospital? You were born
on a pinochle table at McSorley's bar.

02:08.734 --> 02:11.700
Hospital? Like your father
was a member of the Aetna family.

02:12.100 --> 02:15.333
The closest he ever got to a hospital
was when he came to deliver ice.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.800
Ma, guilt is not going to work.

02:18.867 --> 02:23.667
You're right. I was naive to think
you'd give an old woman one last chance

02:23.734 --> 02:26.200
to regain her daughter's respect.

02:26.767 --> 02:31.233
-I'll just stick my head in the oven--
-All right, ma.

02:31.934 --> 02:35.500
Maybe guilt will work,
but, ma, this is the last time.

02:35.567 --> 02:37.900
Oh, thanks, pussycat. You won't regret it.

02:37.967 --> 02:40.166
Would you mind taking
him for a walk tonight?

02:41.266 --> 02:44.700
Ma, forget it. Forget it.
The dog is all yours.

02:44.767 --> 02:46.800
Oh. Come on.

02:49.567 --> 02:52.400
Why is there a big,
hairy beast in my house?

02:52.467 --> 02:54.533
My guess is because he
bought you dinner.

02:58.600 --> 02:59.867
Well, Blanche, I got to run.

02:59.934 --> 03:04.166
Thank you for a lovely afternoon, Gary.
I hope I see you again real soon.

03:04.233 --> 03:07.266
-You can count on it.
-Bye, Gar.

03:09.033 --> 03:11.900
Well, you and Gary have hit it off.

03:11.967 --> 03:14.233
Well, why shouldn't we? The man's perfect.

03:14.300 --> 03:18.533
He only owns the most successful chain of
funeral homes in greater Miami.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.233
With this heat wave we're having,

03:22.300 --> 03:25.433
he's got them stacked up like firewood
in all four locations.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.900
-Hi, girls. Is she here yet?
-Who, Rose?

03:31.967 --> 03:34.900
My sister. I left you a note
on your bathroom mirror.

03:34.967 --> 03:37.533
Why on my bathroom mirror?

03:37.600 --> 03:39.834
It was the only one that had enough steam.

03:46.367 --> 03:49.900
-Which sister is this, Rose?
-My younger sister Holly.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.133
Frankly, I'm not too happy about it.

03:52.767 --> 03:55.967
This is a terrible thing to say,
but I don't really like her.

03:58.133 --> 04:01.967
-We didn't get along as kids.
-Why is she coming here, then?

04:02.033 --> 04:05.934
Well, she's here on business.
She's a world-renowned flautist.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.200
She plays the flute.

04:07.734 --> 04:09.800
No, Dorothy. She plays the flaut.

04:12.734 --> 04:14.300
It's a Scandinavian instrument

04:14.367 --> 04:16.967
that looks like a tuba
except it's got hair on the bottom.

04:17.033 --> 04:18.734
Of course she plays the flute.

04:20.133 --> 04:22.600
I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little wound up.

04:22.667 --> 04:25.166
-(doorbell rings)
-That's Holly now.

04:25.800 --> 04:29.000
-Will you guys help me through this?
-Well, sure. Absolutely.

04:29.066 --> 04:30.266
Oh, thanks a million.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.867
God, I hate this woman.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.800
-Holly.
-Oh, Rose. Oh, Rose.

04:40.100 --> 04:43.100
It's so good to see you.
You look just wonderful.

04:43.166 --> 04:45.567
So do you. Come in. Meet my friends.
This is--

04:45.633 --> 04:47.166
Wait, wait. Let me.

04:47.233 --> 04:52.667
She's attractive, witty, and great fun
to be with. This must be Dorothy.

04:53.200 --> 04:58.567
And she's smart, sexy, and stylish
to a fault. This must be Blanche.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.333
-Did I get it right?
-You're right.

05:01.967 --> 05:05.400
Thank goodness. I worried all the way over
here I'd get it backwards.

05:05.467 --> 05:07.867
I could have lived with smart and sexy.

05:10.967 --> 05:12.967
You do live with smart and sexy.

05:15.333 --> 05:16.533
Who's this?

05:16.600 --> 05:19.667
-Holly, this is--
-Wait now, Rose. Let me.

05:20.133 --> 05:26.233
She's feisty, zesty,
and full of old world charm, Sophia.

05:26.300 --> 05:29.166
She's mopey, dopey, and full of crap,
Rose's sister.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.533
Don't mess with me, kid.
I have the home court advantage.

05:36.467 --> 05:41.967
(serene music playing)

05:55.300 --> 05:57.500
-Honey, what are you looking for?
-Nothing.

05:58.967 --> 06:02.533
-Now, Sophia, tell me the truth.
-All right. Dreyfuss is gone.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.934
-He ran away?
-No, we had a falling out

06:05.000 --> 06:06.867
and agreed to a trial separation.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.834
-Of course he ran away.
-When?

06:10.900 --> 06:13.200
I'm not sure. I have it pinpointed.

06:13.266 --> 06:17.066
Sometime between 10:15 today
and late last Thursday.

06:20.333 --> 06:23.934
You have no recollection of Dreyfuss
since last Thursday?

06:24.000 --> 06:27.333
I have no recollection, period,
since last Thursday.

06:28.033 --> 06:30.033
Anything could have
happened in three days.

06:30.767 --> 06:33.834
I just hope I'm not carrying
Steve Garvey's baby.

06:42.967 --> 06:45.934
Honey, listen, don't panic.
As soon as the girls get home from work,

06:46.000 --> 06:48.233
we'll fan out through the neighborhood
and we'll find Dreyfuss.

06:48.300 --> 06:50.367
No go, Blanche,
I need to handle this myself.

06:50.433 --> 06:52.567
-Why?
-Because if Dorothy finds out

06:52.633 --> 06:55.300
that I lost Dreyfuss,
she'll never trust me with anything again.

06:55.367 --> 06:59.900
That's why I'm begging you, please,
promise me on your mother's grave.

06:59.967 --> 07:01.934
You won't breathe a word of this
to Dorothy, you promise.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.600
-Yes, sure, Sophia.
-Good.

07:04.667 --> 07:06.266
Now, I can save what I know about you

07:06.333 --> 07:08.934
and the twin rabbinical students
for another time.

07:12.734 --> 07:14.967
(doorbell rings)

07:20.200 --> 07:22.367
-Hi, Rose.
-Hi, Gary. Come on in.

07:22.433 --> 07:24.567
I just wanted to drop
off Blanche's earrings.

07:24.633 --> 07:26.700
They must have fallen off
in my car the other night.

07:26.767 --> 07:28.767
I'll get Blanche for you,
she's in the kitchen.

07:28.834 --> 07:30.700
Ah, no, don't do that.

07:31.166 --> 07:33.834
Actually, there's something that
I wanted to talk to you about.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.000
What is it, Gary?

07:35.800 --> 07:39.967
Rose, I find you very attractive.

07:40.767 --> 07:44.433
Much more attractive than most
of the women I come in contact with.

07:49.233 --> 07:52.467
Aren't most of the women
you come in contact with dead?

07:54.934 --> 07:57.533
What I was talking about is us.

07:57.934 --> 08:01.166
-Would you consider going out with me?
-What about Blanche?

08:01.233 --> 08:03.767
I think it would be best
if she stayed at home.

08:04.867 --> 08:06.967
Unless you know something that I don't.

08:07.967 --> 08:09.700
You're disgusting.

08:11.533 --> 08:16.000
-Oh, hi, what are you doing here?
-I was just bringing back your earrings.

08:16.066 --> 08:18.734
-Oh.
-Well... I've gotta run.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.100
-Thank you.
-See you Saturday?

08:21.166 --> 08:22.400
You bet, darling.

08:24.834 --> 08:27.600
Rose Nyland, if I didn't know better,

08:27.667 --> 08:30.166
I might think you were trying
to steal my boyfriend.

08:30.233 --> 08:31.800
I'm innocent, Blanche.

08:31.867 --> 08:34.300
Well, I know it, that's
why Gary's dating me.

08:37.166 --> 08:41.400
He's a lewd, horny, over-sexed
beast with five hands.

08:43.533 --> 08:47.233
You don't have to build him up to me,
honey, I like him fine already.

08:51.367 --> 08:55.033
-Oh, it's 5:00. Where's Holly?
-Out with Dorothy, I think.

08:55.100 --> 08:58.567
Still? I'm going
to owe Dorothy big for this one.

08:58.633 --> 09:01.633
I don't think you're being fair to Holly.

09:01.700 --> 09:04.166
Now, I spent three afternoons
with her this week,

09:04.233 --> 09:07.033
and she was lovely company each time.

09:07.100 --> 09:09.900
Last night she even took me
out to Antonio's.

09:09.967 --> 09:12.233
Antonio's?
Well, that's right down by my office.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.700
Why didn't you guys call?

09:13.767 --> 09:17.200
Holly called. She said somebody said
you weren't there.

09:17.266 --> 09:18.533
But I was.

09:18.600 --> 09:23.734
It's just a mix-up. We had a terrific
time. I really like Holly.

09:24.867 --> 09:29.300
Holly. That... that has
to be one of the funniest stories

09:29.367 --> 09:30.834
I've heard in ages.

09:30.900 --> 09:35.400
-Doesn't Rose ever tell St. Olaf stories?
-All the time.

09:38.567 --> 09:40.100
-Hello, Blanche.
-Hi, darling.

09:40.166 --> 09:41.166
Hi, Rose.

09:41.233 --> 09:44.400
Sounds like you girls had
a nice afternoon.

09:44.467 --> 09:47.200
Nice doesn't begin to describe it.

09:47.266 --> 09:53.200
We went shopping, we had lunch and
we picked up theater tickets for tonight.

09:53.266 --> 09:57.800
-Oh, great. What are we seeing?
-Oh, I feel terrible.

09:57.867 --> 10:00.600
See, you told me
you'd probably be busy tonight,

10:00.667 --> 10:03.400
so I just got seats
for Dorothy, Blanche, and me.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.834
Oh, honey, don't worry.
You can have my ticket.

10:06.900 --> 10:10.500
Oh, no, Dorothy. That wouldn't be fair.
You three should go.

10:10.567 --> 10:13.500
I mean, we can meet for coffee afterwards.

10:13.567 --> 10:15.033
Oh. Great.

10:16.934 --> 10:18.633
She's doing it again.

10:18.700 --> 10:21.000
First it was Antonio's,
then it was the tickets.

10:21.066 --> 10:25.200
-She's leaving me out intentionally.
-Rose, they were just misunderstandings.

10:25.266 --> 10:28.066
-Now, you're overreacting.
-I guess so.

10:28.133 --> 10:31.266
These things happen
between sisters all the time.

10:31.333 --> 10:34.700
My sister Virginia
wouldn't talk to me for a month

10:34.767 --> 10:36.633
all because I smiled at her boyfriend.

10:36.700 --> 10:38.266
Listen to Blanche.

10:38.333 --> 10:42.233
Of course, I was skinny-dipping
on his property at the time.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.400
-Don't listen to Blanche.
-All right. It was his bathtub.

10:47.467 --> 10:50.266
We were blowing suds
off each other when she walked in.

10:50.333 --> 10:55.834
-Blanche, what is the point of this story?
-Point? There's no point.

10:55.900 --> 10:57.233
I just like telling it.

10:59.834 --> 11:04.200
(calm music playing)

11:07.633 --> 11:09.266
Well, Blanche, what do you think?

11:09.600 --> 11:11.900
Sophia, what have you done?

11:11.967 --> 11:14.900
Saved my puckered, little Sicilian behind,
that's what.

11:16.266 --> 11:18.000
When Dreyfuss didn't come home
again this morning,

11:18.066 --> 11:23.500
-I got a duplicate. Amazing, isn't it?
-Yeah, except for one thing.

11:30.734 --> 11:34.934
-Dreyfuss came home this afternoon.
-Holy cow.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.667
Don't worry. Just take that dog back.

11:37.734 --> 11:40.266
I can't. The pet shop's closed
till Monday.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.200
(Dorothy) Somebody help me
with the groceries.

11:43.266 --> 11:47.333
Oh, great. That's Dorothy. I got to get
both dogs into my room. Come on, boys!

11:47.400 --> 11:50.700
You know, I'm not too sure
that's a good idea.

11:51.633 --> 11:54.233
If Dorothy sees me with these two,
she'll know I screwed up.

11:54.300 --> 11:59.533
There's something you're not considering.
Sophia. Oh, dear.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.233
Sophia, I think you're
making a big mistake.

12:02.300 --> 12:05.433
I just need to keep the new dog hidden
till Monday.

12:05.500 --> 12:11.333
With both those dogs in the same room,
how are you going to know which is which?

12:16.066 --> 12:17.266
I'm screwed.

12:23.834 --> 12:26.800
We have to meet Holly
at the movies in 10 minutes.

12:26.867 --> 12:27.867
Ok.

12:28.667 --> 12:32.100
-I am so mad I could spit.
-Rose, what happened?

12:32.166 --> 12:37.000
Those directions Holly gave me for meeting
you for lunch were totally wrong.

12:37.066 --> 12:40.000
You don't think she did that on purpose.

12:40.066 --> 12:42.133
-Well, I do.
-Oh, that's silly.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.333
You don't know Holly.

12:43.400 --> 12:47.333
She just got her directions all mixed up.
It was a mistake.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.734
Just like it was a mistake
leaving me out of dinner at Antonio's

12:50.800 --> 12:55.667
-and leaving me home from the play?
-You're overreacting to this.

12:55.734 --> 12:58.867
Calm down. Let's just go and enjoy
the movie.

12:59.567 --> 13:00.834
What movie?

13:03.133 --> 13:06.467
We're meeting Holly.
Didn't she mention it to you?

13:06.533 --> 13:10.500
No. I suppose you'll say
it's just a silly mix-up.

13:10.567 --> 13:13.767
I'm not falling for that again.
I'm not going.

13:13.834 --> 13:18.867
Fine, Rose, but I do think it's time
you realize Holly's a terrific person

13:18.934 --> 13:21.900
and would not do anything to hurt anybody.

13:21.967 --> 13:26.967
The sooner you realize that, the happier
we'll all be. Come on, Blanche.

13:40.433 --> 13:44.000
(serene music playing)

13:50.800 --> 13:54.400
-Another slice of cheesecake, Blanche?
-Oh, I really shouldn't.

13:54.467 --> 13:58.934
-Lately, you've been eating like a bird.
-Yeah. Rodan.

14:03.900 --> 14:06.000
Oh, girls, I'm so glad you're still up.

14:07.266 --> 14:12.100
-I need to talk to you. I have a problem.
-Oh, honey, we know you do.

14:12.834 --> 14:14.767
You got to stop buying your hair coloring

14:14.834 --> 14:17.934
out of that 99-cent-or-less bin
at the pic 'n' save.

14:20.200 --> 14:24.700
-This problem has to do with Holly.
-Her hair's not the color of a Twinkie.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.133
Holly has done something terrible,
Blanche.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.900
-I think you ought to know about it.
-Listen, darling, whatever it is,

14:32.967 --> 14:34.533
I'm really not interested.

14:34.867 --> 14:37.867
Rose, Blanche and I have
been talking about this.

14:37.934 --> 14:41.333
There is a problem all right,
but it's not between us and Holly,

14:41.400 --> 14:43.133
it's between you and Holly.

14:43.200 --> 14:47.533
You've been trying to convince us
that she's been doing terrible things.

14:47.600 --> 14:51.433
-It simply isn't true.
-See, we happen to like Holly,

14:51.500 --> 14:54.700
so whatever the problem is,
you just kind of leave us out of it

14:54.767 --> 14:56.600
and you settle it with her, ok?

15:02.300 --> 15:04.100
All right, Rose, out with it.

15:04.166 --> 15:07.000
-What did Holly do that's so terrible?
-Why do you care?

15:07.066 --> 15:08.600
You won't believe me anyway.

15:08.667 --> 15:11.734
Hey, Sicilians can always recognize
two things...

15:11.800 --> 15:13.333
when someone is telling the truth

15:13.400 --> 15:15.500
and when they've had
their fingerprints changed.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.600
I know whatever you're going to say
is the truth.

15:21.667 --> 15:26.900
This afternoon I saw Blanche's boyfriend
Gary Tucker kissing my sister Holly.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.633
Oh, please. You're such a liar.

15:31.133 --> 15:35.233
-I swear on my mother's grave.
-Ok, ok. I believe you.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.934
What should I do, Sophia?

15:37.433 --> 15:40.867
Well, this is a very complex
and perplexing question.

15:40.934 --> 15:46.867
It has to do with honesty,
friendship, love, hate, all the biggies.

15:48.233 --> 15:49.700
So what should I do?

15:49.767 --> 15:53.700
Please. Socrates sat under
a tree for years

15:53.767 --> 15:55.400
thinking about this kind of stuff.

15:56.100 --> 15:58.700
I'm a poor immigrant
with a third-grade education.

15:58.767 --> 16:00.333
Give me two minutes.

16:02.867 --> 16:05.667
-Sorry.
-Ok. I got it.

16:06.433 --> 16:11.066
My uncle Carlo always used to say,
"honesty is the best policy."

16:11.400 --> 16:14.700
Of course,
uncle Carlo died a penniless drunk.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.200
I don't understand.

16:17.266 --> 16:20.734
The point is if you're honest
every second,

16:20.800 --> 16:22.600
it doesn't always turn out for the best.

16:22.667 --> 16:24.333
That was the case with my uncle Carlo.

16:24.834 --> 16:27.333
He honestly remembered the license number

16:27.400 --> 16:30.000
of the trigger man
in the Sanducci vendetta.

16:31.233 --> 16:32.700
So, you're saying

16:32.767 --> 16:35.300
because nobody's going
to believe me anyway,

16:35.367 --> 16:39.233
I'm better off if I let people find out
what's going on for themselves?

16:39.300 --> 16:41.633
I wouldn't chisel that
into a stone tablet,

16:41.700 --> 16:43.900
but it sounds serviceable at this hour.

16:44.934 --> 16:48.367
Oh, thanks a lot, Sophia. Good night.

16:48.633 --> 16:52.200
Uh, hold it, Rose.
I need some advice, too.

16:52.266 --> 16:56.400
-You need advice from me?
-Yeah. Frightening, isn't it?

16:58.900 --> 17:01.567
-It's about Dreyfuss.
-Ok.

17:01.834 --> 17:02.967
What about Dreyfuss?

17:03.033 --> 17:05.433
The other day I thought he was lost,
so I got a second dog,

17:05.500 --> 17:09.333
-and then the first one came back.
-Sophia, are you kidding me?

17:10.400 --> 17:11.834
Come see for yourself.

17:17.233 --> 17:20.533
-Wow. Two Dreyfusses.
-No. One Dreyfuss.

17:20.600 --> 17:22.600
That's the point,
I want to return the second,

17:22.667 --> 17:26.400
but I can't tell which is which.
What do I do?

17:26.934 --> 17:32.667
There's only one thing I can think of.
We used to do it on the farm.

17:32.734 --> 17:36.700
-Whatever it is, do it. I'm desperate.
-Ok.

17:37.567 --> 17:38.767
Here goes.

17:39.900 --> 17:42.166
Dreyfuss, come here, boy.

17:53.300 --> 17:54.767
This one's Dreyfuss.

18:01.233 --> 18:04.066
(mellow music playing)

18:04.133 --> 18:07.667
I don't get it, Blanche.
This isn't like you.

18:07.734 --> 18:10.967
Gary calls at the last minute,
cancels your date,

18:11.033 --> 18:15.700
-you're not the least bit upset.
-Well, Dorothy, give me some credit.

18:15.767 --> 18:17.967
What kind of person
would doubt a man

18:18.033 --> 18:21.767
whose mother needs emergency
gall bladder surgery to save her life?

18:23.700 --> 18:26.533
Besides, the hospital said
the operation would take five hours,

18:26.600 --> 18:30.133
and that restaurant just would not hold
our reservations past 8:30.

18:32.934 --> 18:37.400
Blanche. Dorothy.
I wasn't expecting you home till later.

18:37.467 --> 18:41.533
I got off work early,
and Blanche's plans were cancelled.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.367
What are you up to tonight?

18:43.433 --> 18:46.567
Oh, nothing. Just a quiet evening at home.

19:03.233 --> 19:05.633
Where did those pants come from?

19:06.266 --> 19:08.367
According to the label, the Gap.

19:11.834 --> 19:14.533
Hold it, Dorothy. Don't you get it?

19:14.600 --> 19:18.934
Holly has company. Well... heh heh.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.333
Nice going, girl.
You're a pretty fast worker.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.600
I guess that's something
we have in common.

19:32.100 --> 19:34.467
That's something else you have in common.

19:37.333 --> 19:42.533
Well, Gary Tucker...
you miserable, no-good lowlife,

19:42.600 --> 19:45.700
-you told me your mama was having surgery.
-She is.

19:47.667 --> 19:49.500
Blanche, please let me explain.

19:49.567 --> 19:52.567
Why? So you can make up
some cockamamie story

19:52.633 --> 19:55.767
about how you're two ships
passing in the night

19:55.834 --> 19:59.367
and it'll never happen again?
I've heard all that before.

19:59.433 --> 20:01.934
-You have?
-Yes. Only usually I'm one of the ships.

20:05.667 --> 20:11.367
-Well, Rose, it's all out in the open now.
-I can see that.

20:15.767 --> 20:18.734
Holly, I'd like to speak with you
in the kitchen, please.

20:20.500 --> 20:24.066
Well, uh...
I'll just grab my pants and go.

20:24.133 --> 20:26.700
(barks)

20:30.767 --> 20:33.834
-Holly...
-Rose, I don't need a lecture.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.400
-It's over.
-No, it's not.

20:36.967 --> 20:40.600
I'll leave in the morning.
Obviously, I won't be coming back.

20:40.667 --> 20:44.000
So that's where it ends?
That's neat, isn't it?

20:44.066 --> 20:49.333
You walk in, borrow my friends a while,
then start acting like a stupid jerk,

20:49.400 --> 20:53.033
and waltz right out
as if nothing happened.

20:53.100 --> 20:57.100
-Do you want an apology?
-I want an explanation.

20:57.166 --> 20:59.266
Holly, I can't figure you out.

20:59.333 --> 21:02.667
You're smart, you've got a career,
you're attractive.

21:02.734 --> 21:05.867
Why do you always have to act
like such a jackass?

21:08.433 --> 21:12.367
Maybe I just never learned
to be the great person my big sister was.

21:12.433 --> 21:15.100
-Oh, Holly!
-It's true, Rose.

21:15.166 --> 21:19.100
You always had the friends. I didn't.
You had boyfriends, girlfriends.

21:19.166 --> 21:22.066
You were friends
with every animal on the farm.

21:23.834 --> 21:25.967
I never learned how to make friends.

21:26.033 --> 21:30.767
You never learned how to keep friends.
You never thought of anybody but yourself.

21:31.300 --> 21:36.333
Stop looking for other people to blame.
This is your problem.

21:36.867 --> 21:43.066
I always felt so guilty for not getting
along with you, but that's over.

21:43.133 --> 21:47.200
Just because we're sisters
doesn't mean we have to be friends.

21:47.266 --> 21:51.467
I'd like to be someday,
but you'll have to make the first move.

21:52.500 --> 21:53.600
Goodbye, Holly.

22:04.300 --> 22:07.233
-Honey, are you all right?
-I'm fine.

22:07.800 --> 22:10.400
Oh, Rose, honey, can you ever forgive us?

22:10.467 --> 22:12.633
It all depends.

22:12.700 --> 22:15.934
Will you believe what I say
even if it isn't what you want to hear?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.066
Oh, of course we will.

22:18.133 --> 22:21.934
Will you believe me
when I tell you that somebody isn't nice?

22:22.000 --> 22:23.900
Of course we will.

22:23.967 --> 22:26.700
Will you believe our pig Lester

22:26.767 --> 22:29.767
always predicted the best supporting
actor Oscar winner

22:29.834 --> 22:32.900
-every year since 19--
-Don't push it, Rose.

22:34.467 --> 22:36.233
Ok, I forgive you.

22:36.300 --> 22:39.200
There he is. I've looked
all over for that dog.

22:39.266 --> 22:42.066
Harry's back. Time for Dreyfuss to go
home.

22:42.133 --> 22:45.066
-Now, see, that wasn't so bad.
-You're right.

22:45.133 --> 22:47.800
Actually, he was very little trouble.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.033
Yeah. No trouble at all.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.367
Come on, Dreyfuss. Let's go.

22:56.300 --> 22:59.033
Yo, Dreyfuss. It's checkout time.

23:01.367 --> 23:04.433
He's acting as though
Dreyfuss isn't even his name.

23:10.834 --> 23:13.467
Of course Dreyfuss is his name, right,
Dreyfuss?

23:14.266 --> 23:15.333
Dreyfuss...

23:16.533 --> 23:20.700
Come on. Maybe we'll
swing by the pet shop on the way home.

23:34.000 --> 23:40.033
(theme music playing)
