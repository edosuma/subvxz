00:03.742 --> 00:06.155
Mindy, Ben, as your couples' therapist,

00:06.240 --> 00:09.433
I remind you that an open
dialogue is very important.

00:09.434 --> 00:13.232
And very expensive. $250 an hour.

00:13.233 --> 00:15.700
This sofa's not even that comfortable.

00:15.725 --> 00:17.073
I don't know where the money's going.

00:17.074 --> 00:18.994
I have a very nice house upstate.

00:18.995 --> 00:21.916
Ben. What's on your mind today?

00:21.917 --> 00:24.630
Well, my issue is that I still
never see her.

00:24.631 --> 00:26.843
Last night, I cooked her favorite meal,

00:26.844 --> 00:28.721
chicken pot pie a la mode,

00:28.722 --> 00:30.266
but she never came home
so I just threw it in the trash.

00:30.267 --> 00:31.727
I still ate it!

00:31.728 --> 00:32.855
And, like, two pages of newspaper

00:32.856 --> 00:34.649
that it was resting on.

00:34.650 --> 00:36.236
Mindy, coming home
to a home-cooked meal by Ben

00:36.237 --> 00:39.786
would be most women's dream come true.

00:39.787 --> 00:42.540
You're right; I should have
told a screaming woman in labor

00:42.541 --> 00:44.503
that I had to rush home
for a home-cooked meal.

00:44.504 --> 00:46.090
All right, I see we're going
nowhere with this.

00:46.091 --> 00:47.550
Why don't we take a look
at this week's homework.

00:47.551 --> 00:49.388
Right. Yes, okay.

00:53.105 --> 00:55.818
"Mindy, what I appreciate about you

00:55.819 --> 00:58.614
is your work ethic
and you're a good mother."

00:58.615 --> 01:01.620
Oh, that was beautiful.

01:01.621 --> 01:02.998
Mindy.

01:02.999 --> 01:05.796
"Ben, what I appreciate about you

01:05.797 --> 01:09.720
is your work ethic and that
you're a good father."

01:09.721 --> 01:12.475
"Mindy, what I'm frustrated about is,

01:12.476 --> 01:14.730
"when I feel like our
relationship is an afterthought

01:14.731 --> 01:16.525
to your day."

01:16.526 --> 01:19.281
"Ben, what I'm frustrated about is,

01:19.282 --> 01:20.491
nothing."

01:20.492 --> 01:22.120
Perfect wife, no complaints,

01:22.121 --> 01:24.166
three-pointer, swish-swish, bish.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.628
Mindy, you're just looking
at your pedometer.

01:26.629 --> 01:29.342
It says you've only taken
eight steps today.

01:29.343 --> 01:32.098
How is that even possible?

01:32.099 --> 01:33.601
Listen, we've been coming here for weeks

01:33.602 --> 01:35.563
and we have yet to get a diagnosis.

01:35.564 --> 01:37.860
My diagnoses take, like,
five seconds, okay?

01:37.861 --> 01:40.114
Patients in; small talk; stirrups;

01:40.115 --> 01:41.658
"You have a UTI"; lollipop;

01:41.659 --> 01:43.704
"No, we don't take Obamacare." Done!

01:43.705 --> 01:45.333
You are married to
an incredibly intelligent,

01:45.334 --> 01:47.253
genuine man with...

01:47.254 --> 01:49.049
soulful eyes.

01:49.050 --> 01:50.928
And yet you've made
no significant changes

01:50.929 --> 01:53.557
to your lifestyle to
accommodate your marriage.

01:53.558 --> 01:56.146
That's not true; I shave
my legs, like, once a month.

01:56.147 --> 01:57.984
I mean, at least, one of them.

01:59.070 --> 02:00.906
Mindy, here, the point is,

02:00.907 --> 02:02.952
how is this relationship gonna last

02:02.953 --> 02:05.164
when you face a real challenge?

02:05.165 --> 02:06.625
Uh, when we face a real challenge,

02:06.626 --> 02:08.169
we'll conquer it with our love.

02:08.170 --> 02:09.714
Why are you being so quiet right now?

02:09.715 --> 02:11.552
I don't think he's being quiet.

02:11.553 --> 02:15.268
He's speaking paragraphs
with those eyes.

02:18.309 --> 02:21.029

02:25.159 --> 02:27.089
Guys, stop everything.

02:27.177 --> 02:28.605
Do you guys think I'm a bad wife?

02:28.630 --> 02:30.887
I would kill to be married to you.

02:30.912 --> 02:33.387
You got all these nooks and crannies
that can keep me warm.

02:33.388 --> 02:35.207
Ben is so lucky; you pay for everything.

02:35.232 --> 02:37.436
It's like he's Melania,
and you're the American taxpayer.

02:37.461 --> 02:39.053
- Oh, Jody!
- Yep.

02:39.078 --> 02:40.537
Do you think that I'm a bad wife?

02:40.562 --> 02:41.821
Oh, yeah, you're definitely a bad wife.

02:41.822 --> 02:43.351
But like Michael Jackson "Bad."

02:43.376 --> 02:44.898
♪ Sha-mon, hee-hee ♪

02:44.923 --> 02:46.264
'Cause I'm definitely that.

02:46.289 --> 02:48.877
No, not Michael Jackson bad.
Just regular bad.

02:48.878 --> 02:50.797
You know how I hate to be un-PC.

02:50.798 --> 02:53.761
No, you don't; you won that
category in speech team.

02:53.762 --> 02:55.306
You're right. Yes, I did.

02:55.307 --> 02:57.393
For my original oratory entitled,

02:57.394 --> 02:59.022
"Why do they get to say it?"

02:59.023 --> 03:01.443
But as I was saying,
I think women these days

03:01.444 --> 03:04.282
have forgotten the importance
of femininity in relationships.

03:04.283 --> 03:06.453
I'm sorry, you don't
think Dr. L is feminine?

03:06.454 --> 03:08.290
She gets her period every other day.

03:08.291 --> 03:10.419
Yeah, and she's always
ordering bras to the office

03:10.420 --> 03:12.298
from that company
Little Miss Asymmetrical.

03:12.299 --> 03:13.885
Yeah, Jody. Take that.

03:13.886 --> 03:14.971
You asked my opinion, and I gave it.

03:14.972 --> 03:16.181
But sure, don't trust me;

03:16.182 --> 03:17.684
trust these three geniuses.

03:17.685 --> 03:18.937
What do you got? What do you got?

03:18.938 --> 03:20.147
I'm gonna pull it right out.

03:20.148 --> 03:21.692
Oh, yeah, it's a big one.

03:21.693 --> 03:24.030
Oh!

03:24.031 --> 03:25.449
- Get a pic.
- Hold on. One, two, three.

03:25.450 --> 03:26.953
- Ew, what?
- Got it.

03:26.954 --> 03:28.414
Post that on social media.

03:28.415 --> 03:29.917
Everyone, we have an announcement.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.963
After ten months of successful dating,

03:31.964 --> 03:34.300
Anna and I have decided it would be best

03:34.301 --> 03:35.971
if we romantically decoupled.

03:35.972 --> 03:36.973
Romantically decoupled?

03:36.974 --> 03:38.475
What is that?

03:38.476 --> 03:40.312
It's Hollywood speak for breaking up.

03:40.313 --> 03:42.150
Like how being dehydrated
means you're on drugs.

03:42.151 --> 03:44.320
No! How is this possible?

03:44.321 --> 03:46.575
You two made me believe in love again.

03:46.576 --> 03:48.162
It's the worst day of my life.

03:48.163 --> 03:49.247
What about when you broke your neck?

03:49.248 --> 03:50.666
Oh, not even close!

03:50.667 --> 03:52.587
That was vacation compared to this.

03:52.588 --> 03:54.174
- Okay.
- Yes, it is unfortunate,

03:54.175 --> 03:57.221
but we both agree it is for the best.

03:57.222 --> 03:58.933
Chaps, we really appreciate
your support,

03:58.934 --> 04:01.062
but Anna and I will continue to
be good friends.

04:01.063 --> 04:03.734
Back to work, everybody.

04:03.735 --> 04:06.031
This is so sad.

04:06.032 --> 04:09.955
I'm gonna have to get real
dehydrated tonight.

04:09.956 --> 04:12.210
Come in.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.253
- Hey.
- Hey, Ben.

04:13.254 --> 04:14.422
What are you doing here?

04:14.423 --> 04:15.884
Oh, no. Did you find out

04:15.885 --> 04:17.512
that I was using your toothbrush?

04:17.512 --> 04:19.474
I've only been using it on my eyebrows.

04:19.475 --> 04:21.560
No. I wanted to talk to you

04:21.562 --> 04:24.359
about a really exciting
job opportunity I got today.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.029
Oh, is it to be...

04:26.030 --> 04:27.532
Not to be a nude nurse for elderly men.

04:27.533 --> 04:29.035
Mindy, I already told you,

04:29.036 --> 04:30.872
I do not feel comfortable doing that.

04:30.873 --> 04:32.793
I know, but we are living in
a gig economy, Ben,

04:32.794 --> 04:34.170
and I think you would make
a lot in tips.

04:34.171 --> 04:35.882
Okay, well, thank you, but...

04:35.883 --> 04:37.385
No.

04:37.386 --> 04:39.013
It's actually to be the head nurse

04:39.014 --> 04:41.560
in the Penn Memorial Emergency Room.

04:41.561 --> 04:44.232
In Philadelphia?
That's almost in another state.

04:44.233 --> 04:45.609
It is definitely in another state.

04:45.610 --> 04:47.071
Pennsylvania.

04:47.072 --> 04:48.365
Oh, right, where Dracula lives.

04:48.366 --> 04:49.659
- Okay, go on.
- Anyway,

04:49.660 --> 04:50.744
the interview's tomorrow.

04:50.745 --> 04:51.914
Obviously the distance

04:51.915 --> 04:53.333
is a real issue,

04:53.334 --> 04:55.713
so maybe I shouldn't go?

04:55.714 --> 04:58.218
No, no, no. I mean, it sounds like

04:58.219 --> 05:00.556
an incredible opportunity.

05:00.557 --> 05:02.853
I think you should interview
and we'll see what happens.

05:02.854 --> 05:05.566
- Okay.
- I ordered a 30-inch sub

05:05.567 --> 05:07.278
for lunch. So you want to stay?

05:07.279 --> 05:08.948
I could spare an inch or two.

05:08.949 --> 05:10.659
Actually I gotta work on my application,

05:10.660 --> 05:12.455
get my interviews khakis ready,

05:12.456 --> 05:14.375
get those pleats poppin'.

05:14.376 --> 05:17.340
- Oh, my God.
- Oh! Morgan.

05:17.341 --> 05:19.093
Don't sneak up on me like that.

05:19.094 --> 05:20.304
Yeah.

05:20.305 --> 05:22.266
Lab results.

05:22.267 --> 05:24.437
So what's going on with you, man?

05:24.438 --> 05:25.564
What's up? What's the goss?

05:25.565 --> 05:26.859
What's the scuttlebutt?

05:26.860 --> 05:28.863
Ben turned me down for lunch,

05:28.864 --> 05:30.699
which is weird, because he's
never done that before, and...

05:30.700 --> 05:32.078
Okay, yeah, no, that's boring.

05:32.079 --> 05:34.207
I mean, like, gossip about,

05:34.208 --> 05:38.674
I don't know, like, nursing
employment opportunities.

05:38.675 --> 05:40.469
Have you heard any gossip in that area?

05:40.470 --> 05:42.139
What? No.

05:42.140 --> 05:43.810
Morgan, I am too hungry for
gossip right now.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.271
Okay, can you please pick up my sandwich

05:45.272 --> 05:47.066
- from the service elevator?
- Got it.

05:47.067 --> 05:48.861
They said it was too big
for the regular elevator.

05:48.862 --> 05:50.489
Oh, you got the Clogger. Nice.

05:50.490 --> 05:52.576
Yeah.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:02.597 --> 06:05.185
Oh. Hello.

06:05.186 --> 06:06.814
I... I didn't mean to interrupt.

06:06.815 --> 06:08.860
But, Jeremy, I found the Limoges box

06:08.861 --> 06:11.698
that we both fell in love with
while antiquing upstate,

06:11.699 --> 06:13.744
and I thought we should have
joint custody.

06:13.745 --> 06:15.497
No, you keep it.

06:15.498 --> 06:18.045
Your jewelry needs organizing
more than mine.

06:18.046 --> 06:20.174
While we're at it, would you
like back the bust

06:20.175 --> 06:22.011
of Queen Victoria that you
gave me for my birthday?

06:22.012 --> 06:23.806
No, that's okay.

06:23.807 --> 06:25.894
I know you like to
rub her wattle for good luck.

06:25.895 --> 06:28.566
- Ah.
- Sorry to bother.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.824
Well, I must say, you handled that well.

06:32.825 --> 06:35.579
- I am proud of you.
- It is but a brave front.

06:35.580 --> 06:39.128
At home I cried so hard that my
Alexa called a suicide hotline.

06:39.129 --> 06:40.631
Don't be a fool, Jeremy;

06:40.632 --> 06:43.136
women are simple insane creatures.

06:43.137 --> 06:45.015
They'll assume anyone you date next

06:45.016 --> 06:46.684
has to be prettier than Anna.

06:46.685 --> 06:48.355
You just leveled up, son.

06:48.356 --> 06:51.152
Leveled up, have I? Really?

06:51.153 --> 06:52.989
Huh, I'm a level two now, I suppose.

06:52.990 --> 06:56.080
Sure. Aim high.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.627
Hey, Morgan,
what do you think of the name

06:59.628 --> 07:00.922
Dominique for a baby?

07:00.923 --> 07:02.675
This site says it's a good name

07:02.676 --> 07:04.303
if you want your child to become
a top-level gymnast

07:04.304 --> 07:05.890
or...

07:05.891 --> 07:08.478
oh, a French sex offender. Never mind.

07:08.479 --> 07:09.815
Hey, did you hear about
this cool nursing job

07:09.816 --> 07:11.109
at Penn Memorial?

07:11.110 --> 07:12.695
They called Ben Miller

07:12.696 --> 07:14.574
for an interview, and no one called me.

07:14.575 --> 07:16.871
Why do you care about a job
in Philadelphia?

07:16.872 --> 07:18.582
Why Ben? I mean...

07:18.583 --> 07:20.085
What does he have that I don't?

07:20.086 --> 07:21.337
No prison record. A working neck...

07:21.338 --> 07:23.049
I don't mean to list things.

07:23.050 --> 07:24.887
Look, look, people think
I have no ambition

07:24.888 --> 07:26.891
just because I have 40 dogs
and I share a bunk bed

07:26.892 --> 07:27.976
with my lesbian roommate,

07:27.977 --> 07:30.564
but I got big dreams.

07:30.565 --> 07:33.653
I'm interviewing for that job.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.909
And guess what.

07:35.910 --> 07:37.579
I'm gonna get it.

07:40.501 --> 07:42.213
Hey.

07:42.214 --> 07:44.133
I need to talk to you.

07:44.134 --> 07:45.594
What did you mean earlier

07:45.595 --> 07:47.556
when you said that I was a bad wife?

07:47.557 --> 07:49.602
Well, let's do a little
thought experiment.

07:49.603 --> 07:50.604
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

07:50.605 --> 07:52.399
Please.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.570
Let's say Ben wants to have
Mexican food for dinner.

07:54.571 --> 07:56.741
You want to have Japanese.
What do you do?

07:56.742 --> 07:58.286
Well, we probably both had
really hard days,

07:58.287 --> 08:00.165
so why don't we eat dinner on our own

08:00.166 --> 08:02.921
and then meet up later at home
to watch "90 Day Fiancé."

08:02.922 --> 08:04.548
Is that a television show
you both enjoy?

08:04.549 --> 08:06.636
- No. Just me.
- All right.

08:06.637 --> 08:08.390
Let's try another one.

08:08.391 --> 08:09.977
Ben's mother is coming to visit
for two weeks.

08:09.978 --> 08:11.897
He wants her to stay in your apartment.

08:11.898 --> 08:13.818
- What do you say?
- Oh, this one's easy.

08:13.819 --> 08:15.947
We put her up at the Hyatt,
we see her a couple times,

08:15.948 --> 08:17.741
take her to "Lion King,"
then bye, Carol.

08:17.742 --> 08:19.370
Am I winning? What did I win?

08:19.371 --> 08:21.082
You've won nothing.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.378
You've answered these questions
very badly.

08:23.379 --> 08:25.340
Oh. I get it, Jody.

08:25.341 --> 08:28.513
I'm a bad wife, because I'm not
some meek Southern

08:28.514 --> 08:30.392
- cake-baking curtsy machine.
- No.

08:30.393 --> 08:31.895
No. No, Mindy. All I'm saying is that

08:31.896 --> 08:33.773
in each instance, you prioritize

08:33.774 --> 08:35.110
your own comfort and independence

08:35.111 --> 08:37.155
over your relationship.

08:37.157 --> 08:40.788
Oh, my God. Jody, I think you're right.

08:40.789 --> 08:42.457
Maybe I have been a little selfish.

08:42.458 --> 08:44.086
That's the best quiz I've taken

08:44.087 --> 08:45.798
since "Which Hogwarts House Are You In?"

08:45.799 --> 08:47.634
- Thank you.
- I was a Dursley.

08:47.635 --> 08:49.305
Thanks.

08:49.306 --> 08:51.184
I wish I could have dinner with you,

08:51.185 --> 08:52.478
but that night I've got a date
to Cirque du Soleil's

08:52.479 --> 08:54.315
new show "Perversia."

08:54.316 --> 08:56.361
How about next week?
I'm dying to cook you my bisque.

08:56.362 --> 08:57.822
I'm booked solid.

08:57.823 --> 08:59.994
My organizer is practically bursting.

09:01.873 --> 09:02.916
Someone's bounced back pretty quickly

09:02.917 --> 09:04.418
from his breakup.

09:04.419 --> 09:05.963
You know that I'm his ex, right?

09:05.964 --> 09:07.216
No, I didn't. If I'd known,

09:07.217 --> 09:08.218
I would have never said that.

09:08.219 --> 09:11.265
I hate drama.

09:11.266 --> 09:13.688
So if they start dating,
will you go insane?

09:15.274 --> 09:17.778
Hey, Dr. L, what do you think
of the name Gabrielle?

09:17.779 --> 09:20.325
Ooh, Tamra, I really like it.

09:20.326 --> 09:23.039
Yeah, I knew it was lame.
Delete, delete, delete.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.043
- Okay.
- Hello, women colleagues.

09:25.044 --> 09:27.131
Tomorrow night I would like to
invite the female coworkers

09:27.132 --> 09:29.677
of our practice to join me
for alcohol drinking

09:29.678 --> 09:31.180
and camaraderie in a bar.

09:31.181 --> 09:33.768
- You mean a girls' night?
- Mm-hmm.

09:33.769 --> 09:35.439
But that's, like, for fun
groups of best friends.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.192
Like, a slut, a prude, a boss,

09:37.193 --> 09:38.737
and a mom who just needed a break.

09:38.738 --> 09:39.948
Hey, I'm, like, three of those things.

09:39.949 --> 09:41.159
Whatever. I'm paying.

09:41.160 --> 09:42.787
- I'm in.
- I'm in too.

09:42.788 --> 09:43.831
My old ball and chain's in Philadelphia

09:43.832 --> 09:44.833
on a job interview.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.377
Oh, my God.

09:46.378 --> 09:48.757
We all know about
the amazing job in Philly

09:48.758 --> 09:50.510
and now everybody want to move to Philly

09:50.511 --> 09:52.139
'cause it's so bomb.

09:52.140 --> 09:55.020
Fine. I'll come to your girls' night.

09:55.021 --> 09:56.941
Maybe I'll even wear a bra.

10:04.039 --> 10:06.584
Thank you for calling
Penn Memorial Hospital.

10:06.585 --> 10:08.798
Your call is very important to us.

10:08.799 --> 10:10.300
But so are a lot other things.

10:10.301 --> 10:13.306
Your estimated wait time is...

10:13.307 --> 10:14.893
two...

10:14.894 --> 10:15.895
days.

10:15.896 --> 10:17.147
Days? What?

10:17.148 --> 10:20.612
Customer service.

10:42.115 --> 10:44.493
My name is Morgan Tookers,

10:44.494 --> 10:46.999
and I am here to interview
for the job opportunity.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.710
No interview necessary.
Mop's in the corner.

10:48.711 --> 10:50.755
Poop's in the hallway.

10:50.756 --> 10:52.301
Poop? No. I'm sorry.

10:52.302 --> 10:53.888
I'm not a janitor.

10:53.889 --> 10:55.640
Look at this suit.

10:55.641 --> 10:57.603
Why are you here? We are very busy.

10:57.604 --> 10:59.398
There was an Eagles game tonight.

10:59.399 --> 11:01.904
We've had 25 gunshot wounds,
and the Eagles won.

11:01.905 --> 11:03.949
- Uh-uh.
- That's great.

11:03.950 --> 11:05.828
'Cause this is exactly the kind
of high stakes urban environment

11:05.829 --> 11:07.247
in which I will thrive.

11:07.248 --> 11:08.959
In fact, I'm telling you right now,

11:08.960 --> 11:10.545
you're not gonna find someone
more qualified

11:10.546 --> 11:12.341
to be the head nurse at this ER.

11:12.342 --> 11:14.888
What? That's my job,
and I ain't leaving.

11:14.889 --> 11:17.559
My... my friend Ben said he was
applying for this job.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.104
Well, I don't know anything about that.

11:19.105 --> 11:20.190
Sounds like your friend is full of crap,

11:20.191 --> 11:21.776
just like our hallway.

11:21.777 --> 11:23.529
Do you want the janitor's job or not?

11:23.530 --> 11:25.408
Yes, I want the janitor's job, okay?

11:25.409 --> 11:28.164
You seem amazing, and
Philadelphia is super exotic.

11:28.165 --> 11:30.627
- Why would Ben lie to Dr. Lahiri?
- Honey, I don't know

11:30.628 --> 11:32.339
your friends.
I'm gonna need you to leave.

11:32.340 --> 11:33.842
Well, I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this.

11:33.843 --> 11:35.428
Please keep that
for your records, please.

11:35.429 --> 11:36.431
- Okay. Mm-hmm.
- Took me four hours.

11:40.514 --> 11:43.544
Leo, I knew it's a little hard
for you to answer,

11:43.569 --> 11:45.114
because I am your mommy,

11:45.139 --> 11:46.785
but how do I look?

11:46.786 --> 11:48.538
- Skinny, Mommy.
- Thank you.

11:48.539 --> 11:51.085
And for giving me your totally
honest opinion,

11:51.086 --> 11:53.006
you may have a graham cracker.

11:56.179 --> 11:57.849
Ben?

11:57.850 --> 11:59.685
Hey. How'd the interview go?

11:59.686 --> 12:01.605
Did you arch your back
like I showed you?

12:01.606 --> 12:04.028
I don't think that works
as well for guys.

12:04.029 --> 12:06.115
Look, I've been thinking about it,

12:06.116 --> 12:07.659
and if you really want that job,

12:07.660 --> 12:09.413
I totally support you.

12:09.414 --> 12:11.000
You can live in Philadelphia,

12:11.001 --> 12:12.879
we can take turns visiting each other.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.173
I actually get hotter the further away

12:14.174 --> 12:15.843
I get from New York City.

12:15.844 --> 12:17.429
And you'd be okay with that arrangement?

12:17.430 --> 12:19.183
I would be more than okay.

12:19.184 --> 12:22.064
Good to know.
I'll see you when I get home.

12:22.065 --> 12:23.399
Oh, I'm going out with
the girls tonight after work,

12:23.400 --> 12:24.903
so I will see you after.

12:24.904 --> 12:26.447
When I get home, I'm gonna be so drunk

12:26.448 --> 12:28.117
my Boston accent will probably come out.

12:28.118 --> 12:30.413
It'll be wicked hot. Go Sox!

12:30.414 --> 12:31.958
Mommy, you're so pretty.

12:38.263 --> 12:40.308
Anna, your dating history is whack.

12:40.309 --> 12:42.062
I can't believe you've only
been with three guys.

12:42.063 --> 12:43.314
I have three dates lined up tonight

12:43.315 --> 12:45.026
in case this gets too boring.

12:45.027 --> 12:47.656
I've killed more people
than you've dated.

12:47.657 --> 12:49.284
So you have lined up any dates at all?

12:49.285 --> 12:50.578
I was messaging with a guy online

12:50.579 --> 12:52.374
who I had lot in common with,

12:52.375 --> 12:55.088
but he turned out to just be
a sentient computer.

12:55.089 --> 12:56.715
Yeah, that lines up.

12:56.716 --> 12:58.719
But when I finally do date a human man,

12:58.720 --> 13:01.308
won't it be weird in the office
for Jeremy?

13:01.309 --> 13:03.020
No! Tamra and I have both

13:03.021 --> 13:05.191
broken up with guys at work,
and it is fine.

13:05.192 --> 13:08.239
Don't forget about me and Dr. Shulman.

13:08.240 --> 13:09.826
Anyway, she and Morgan are
really close right now.

13:09.827 --> 13:11.579
We're not that close.

13:11.580 --> 13:13.249
I mean, sure, we have lunch
together every day

13:13.250 --> 13:14.961
and I talk to him before
I do something big,

13:14.962 --> 13:17.215
but outside of work, we only
hang out, like,

13:17.216 --> 13:19.428
four, five times a week.

13:19.429 --> 13:23.102
Hey, sister, Denial ain't just
a member of One Direction.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.939
Excuse me, ladies.

13:24.940 --> 13:27.360
That gentlemen over there just
sent these your way.

13:27.361 --> 13:28.446
Oh, he fine.

13:28.447 --> 13:29.531
Oh, actually, stop.

13:29.532 --> 13:31.118
These are all for her.

13:31.119 --> 13:32.746
The gentleman didn't know
what you liked,

13:32.747 --> 13:34.625
so he sent you over a whole assortment.

13:34.626 --> 13:36.922
And it's up to you if you want
to share with your...

13:36.923 --> 13:38.967
I want to say bus driver friends?

13:38.968 --> 13:40.345
- Oh.
- Okay.

13:40.346 --> 13:42.182
Oh, my God, Anna. You hit pay dirt.

13:42.183 --> 13:44.394
That guy is hot,
and he's definitely rich

13:44.395 --> 13:46.690
because he could afford to send
over four drinks.

13:46.691 --> 13:48.820
Um, next steps.

13:48.821 --> 13:50.281
Call him over. Okay, I'll do it.

13:50.282 --> 13:52.119
Hey, blondie.

13:53.622 --> 13:55.918
So even though I have my
grandfather's trust fund,

13:55.919 --> 13:57.922
I feel lucky not to have to touch it

13:57.923 --> 13:59.758
because of the money I got from
winning "The Amazing Race"

13:59.759 --> 14:01.220
with my gay brother.

14:01.221 --> 14:02.514
Oh, my God, I remember that season.

14:02.515 --> 14:04.768
He came out to you on the show.

14:04.769 --> 14:06.940
It was the most surprising hot
air balloon ride of my life.

14:06.941 --> 14:09.277
Anna, you two have so much in common.

14:09.278 --> 14:11.031
Financially, racially.

14:11.032 --> 14:14.037
You don't see a lot of adult blond men.

14:14.038 --> 14:15.623
- They tend to darken.
- Mm.

14:15.624 --> 14:17.293
I don't know much about reality TV.

14:17.294 --> 14:19.339
I prefer live theater.

14:19.340 --> 14:23.014
My ex, Jeremy, actually has
written several one-man shows...

14:23.015 --> 14:24.099
Ow!

14:24.100 --> 14:25.309
I love the theater too.

14:25.310 --> 14:26.938
Maybe I could take you sometime.

14:26.939 --> 14:28.232
There's a new jukebox musical coming out

14:28.233 --> 14:29.443
based on the songs of Slipknot.

14:29.444 --> 14:31.071
It's called "Barf Machine."

14:31.072 --> 14:33.659
Devin, thank you so much for the drink.

14:33.660 --> 14:36.123
It was as intoxicating as
the conversation.

14:36.124 --> 14:38.252
Mildly. But I just got out of

14:38.253 --> 14:40.339
a relationship, so I'm not really ready.

14:40.340 --> 14:42.052
I understand.

14:42.053 --> 14:44.681
But if you change your mind,
here's my card.

14:44.682 --> 14:45.976
I'd like to get to know you.

14:45.977 --> 14:46.978
Oh!

14:46.979 --> 14:48.189
Oh, my God!

14:50.904 --> 14:52.907
I apologize. I... okay.

14:52.908 --> 14:54.786
- Wow!
- Anna.

14:54.787 --> 14:58.250
I have never in my life been
banned from a bar

14:58.251 --> 15:00.004
because of someone else's bad behavior.

15:00.005 --> 15:01.715
What the hell, Anna?

15:01.716 --> 15:05.306
I'm sorry. I told you I was
awkward with men.

15:05.307 --> 15:07.185
Awkward would be Zooey Deschanel

15:07.186 --> 15:09.439
playing a jazz standard on the ukulele.

15:09.440 --> 15:10.859
You crushed a man's windpipe.

15:10.860 --> 15:12.487
I'm sorry. I just...

15:12.488 --> 15:13.990
miss Jeremy,

15:13.991 --> 15:15.535
and whenever anybody else touches me,

15:15.536 --> 15:17.163
I have a bit of a violent reaction.

15:17.164 --> 15:19.126
It was a little dramatic.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.628
- Boop.
- Oh!

15:20.629 --> 15:22.423
- Oh, my God.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:22.424 --> 15:24.594
Okay. She's not being dramatic.

15:24.595 --> 15:26.348
- It's real.
- Sorry.

15:26.349 --> 15:28.769
That's the tenth time
you've brought up Jeremy.

15:28.770 --> 15:30.731
Whoever he is, you must really love him.

15:30.732 --> 15:33.696
Oh, God. Maybe I do love him.

15:33.697 --> 15:35.533
Maybe I don't need to date other people.

15:35.534 --> 15:37.287
I just want Jeremy.

15:37.288 --> 15:38.874
He was the one.

15:38.875 --> 15:40.919
He was in front of me the whole time.

15:40.920 --> 15:42.714
And I just took him for granted.

15:42.715 --> 15:45.052
Okay, okay, you've been single
for, like, two days.

15:45.053 --> 15:46.555
Why don't you wait a little longer?

15:46.556 --> 15:48.601
The NYU freshmen show up next week.

15:48.602 --> 15:51.231
- Aren't you married?
- Yeah, but that's not like fun.

15:51.232 --> 15:53.194
That's not like hanging out with
girlfriends and going to bars.

15:53.195 --> 15:54.822
That's very disturbing,

15:54.823 --> 15:56.575
and you should examine
your relationship.

15:56.576 --> 15:58.662
Mm-hmm.

15:58.663 --> 16:00.249
Excuse me. I have to leave.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.752
Oh, man. Anna's hotness

16:01.753 --> 16:03.297
was gonna get us into the club.

16:03.298 --> 16:05.051
Well, at least we have you, Tamra.

16:05.052 --> 16:08.057
You know what, I should
actually head home too.

16:08.058 --> 16:09.977
I got to get up really early tomorrow.

16:09.978 --> 16:12.649
I'm, uh, I'm cohosting "The Today Show,"

16:12.650 --> 16:15.864
so I got to go over my questions
for Rex Tillerson.

16:15.865 --> 16:18.870
Wait, Tam! No.

16:18.871 --> 16:21.416
All right, Bev. It's just you and me.

16:21.417 --> 16:23.712
Want to use your senior discount
at the diner?

16:23.713 --> 16:25.549
Sure don't. Bye!

16:32.022 --> 16:34.609
Hey, Graciela, my favorite nanny.

16:34.610 --> 16:36.280
Quick Spanish question:

16:36.281 --> 16:40.079
the other day Leo called me "estupido."

16:40.080 --> 16:41.540
What does that mean anyway?

16:41.541 --> 16:43.419
Does it mean, like, fashionable?

16:43.420 --> 16:45.631
- Hello.
- God.

16:45.632 --> 16:47.845
Leo's asleep. I sent Graciela home.

16:47.846 --> 16:49.180
And I broke your toilet.

16:49.181 --> 16:52.228
Morgan. What are you doing here?

16:52.229 --> 16:54.984
I have to tell you something.

16:54.985 --> 16:58.741
I went to Philadelphia to try to
steal the nurse's job from Ben.

16:58.742 --> 17:00.161
- But I didn't get it.
- Yeah, of course not,

17:00.162 --> 17:01.873
because Ben locked that down.

17:01.874 --> 17:03.500
Did you see how much gel he had
in his hair?

17:03.501 --> 17:04.502
He looked like a Russian hitman.

17:04.502 --> 17:05.588
I didn't get it

17:05.589 --> 17:06.924
and neither did Ben.

17:06.925 --> 17:08.301
'Cause there was no job.

17:08.303 --> 17:09.637
Ben lied to you.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.433
If you makes you feel better,

17:11.434 --> 17:14.606
I did not lie to you
about breaking your toilet.

17:14.607 --> 17:17.404
There was no toilet paper
so I used a wash cloth.

17:20.964 --> 17:24.369
But if there's no job,
why did he go to Philadelphia?

17:24.460 --> 17:27.048
Oh, no. Do you think he has
another wife there?

17:27.049 --> 17:28.550
I hate to say it, but yeah, I do.

17:28.550 --> 17:29.845
Oh, my God.

17:29.846 --> 17:31.264
Morgan, go. Hide, hide.

17:35.399 --> 17:37.235
Oh, hello, Ben.

17:37.236 --> 17:39.280
How was Philadelphia?

17:39.281 --> 17:41.243
I would ask if you had a chance
to run up the Rambo stairs,

17:41.244 --> 17:42.871
but I'm sure you were too busy
interviewing

17:42.872 --> 17:44.332
for your cool new job.

17:44.333 --> 17:46.169
Mindy, I didn't go to Philadelphia.

17:46.170 --> 17:48.340
There was no nursing job.

17:48.341 --> 17:49.592
I lied.

17:54.520 --> 17:55.939
Morgan.

17:55.940 --> 17:57.901
Game over, dude. You're done.

17:57.902 --> 17:59.320
You didn't go to Philadelphia.

17:59.321 --> 18:01.408
There was no nurse's job.

18:01.409 --> 18:03.162
You lied.

18:03.163 --> 18:04.915
Morgan, Ben just confessed.

18:04.916 --> 18:06.710
- Just now?
- Yeah.

18:06.711 --> 18:08.672
I couldn't hear in the curtain.

18:08.673 --> 18:09.716
Okay, well, you know what, Morgan,

18:09.717 --> 18:11.219
I think you should go.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.680
Ben and I need to talk in private.

18:12.681 --> 18:14.476
All right. I'll be in your bedroom.

18:14.477 --> 18:16.688
Or maybe you could just go to
your own home.

18:16.689 --> 18:17.984
I'll be in your bed.

18:22.994 --> 18:24.790
Coming!

18:26.794 --> 18:28.045
Oof.

18:28.046 --> 18:30.382
Anna. Uh...

18:30.383 --> 18:32.428
What are you doing here? Are you okay?

18:32.429 --> 18:34.307
I'm not okay,

18:34.308 --> 18:36.686
and not because a Postmate ran
over me with his bicycle.

18:36.687 --> 18:39.692
Jeremy, I think I might have
made a horrible mistake.

18:39.693 --> 18:41.571
Jeremy? Is our dinner here?

18:41.572 --> 18:45.746
Because we burnt a lot of
calories with our sex making.

18:45.747 --> 18:47.542
Why you have tire tracks over you?

18:47.543 --> 18:49.754
Just give us a second, Slutvana.

18:49.755 --> 18:51.716
Okay. I'm just gonna go cool

18:51.717 --> 18:53.720
my naked body with some freezer air.

18:56.854 --> 18:58.355
Mm.

18:58.356 --> 18:59.984
I'm sorry you had to see that.

18:59.985 --> 19:02.280
No big deal. I liked meeting her.

19:02.281 --> 19:03.699
She seemed smart and fun.

19:03.700 --> 19:05.369
Before you interrupted,

19:05.370 --> 19:07.623
you were saying something about
a mistake.

19:07.624 --> 19:10.296
Yes, I...

19:10.297 --> 19:11.966
was mistaken when I said I did not want

19:11.967 --> 19:13.635
the Queen Victoria bust.

19:13.636 --> 19:15.264
She has a great deal
of sentimental value,

19:15.265 --> 19:17.059
and I would like her back.

19:17.060 --> 19:19.063
Okay. Now?

19:19.064 --> 19:20.609
- Yes.
- Okay.

19:23.740 --> 19:25.117
Ooh. Are you sure, Anna?

19:25.118 --> 19:26.787
She's quite heavy.

19:26.788 --> 19:29.292
Oh, I am stronger than you'll ever know.

19:29.293 --> 19:30.544
Son of a bitch!

19:30.545 --> 19:31.755
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:31.756 --> 19:33.300
- Got it.
- I'm fine.

19:33.301 --> 19:35.763
That's dense. That's denser than I...

19:35.764 --> 19:38.185
Thought. That's... I'm okay.

19:38.186 --> 19:39.981
- Good evening.
- Good-bye, ladies.

19:41.860 --> 19:43.612
Why would you make up a fake job

19:43.613 --> 19:44.907
in some made-up state?

19:44.908 --> 19:46.534
Pennsylvania is a real state,

19:46.535 --> 19:48.873
and I made it up to see how you'd react.

19:48.874 --> 19:51.169
Dr. Witsel asked us how we would
deal with a real challenge

19:51.170 --> 19:53.256
in our relationship, so I gave us

19:53.257 --> 19:54.802
a real challenge.

19:54.803 --> 19:57.056
- And?
- And we failed.

19:57.057 --> 19:58.475
How is this a failure?

19:58.476 --> 19:59.853
I have been so supportive of you.

19:59.854 --> 20:01.731
It's a failure...

20:01.732 --> 20:03.360
because you don't want to be with me.

20:03.361 --> 20:04.989
What? Why else would I have married you

20:04.990 --> 20:06.366
if I don't want to be with you?

20:06.367 --> 20:09.497
Honestly?

20:09.498 --> 20:12.003
I think you married me because
you love the idea of marriage.

20:12.004 --> 20:13.338
You think I'm a good guy

20:13.339 --> 20:14.465
who's good to your son

20:14.466 --> 20:15.634
and you love my daughter,

20:15.635 --> 20:18.140
and you thought...

20:18.141 --> 20:19.935
maybe one day you would grow to love me.

20:19.936 --> 20:21.521
What was I supposed to do?

20:21.522 --> 20:22.732
Tell you not to go for your dream job?

20:22.733 --> 20:24.360
That's what Danny did to me,

20:24.361 --> 20:25.654
and that's what ruined our relationship.

20:25.655 --> 20:27.742
Mindy, that is not our issue.

20:27.743 --> 20:30.289
Did you really have no problem
living in separate cities

20:30.290 --> 20:32.252
for the foreseeable future?

20:35.843 --> 20:37.762
Well, this next part shouldn't
be too hard for you.

20:37.763 --> 20:39.474
What are you saying?

20:39.475 --> 20:44.525
Mindy, you don't want to be
married to me.

20:44.526 --> 20:46.571
I think we should get a divorce.

20:46.572 --> 20:47.991
Okay.

20:47.992 --> 20:51.206
Wow. That was...

20:51.207 --> 20:53.210
really fast.

20:53.211 --> 20:54.922
Ben, I am sorry.

20:54.923 --> 20:57.218
I don't know why this isn't working,

20:57.219 --> 21:00.809
and I wish I could feel the way
that I am supposed to feel,

21:00.810 --> 21:03.730
but I just don't.

21:03.731 --> 21:05.400
Good-bye.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.123
I'm so sorry.

21:12.124 --> 21:16.464
Thanks, Morgan.

21:16.465 --> 21:18.093
You hear all that?

21:18.599 --> 21:21.558
What? No, I broke your shower.
I'm so sorry.

21:28.782 --> 21:30.576
Tamra, what are you doing here?

21:30.577 --> 21:32.705
Are you dating my neighbor, Mr. Slavos?

21:32.706 --> 21:35.460
That makes sense.
He's amazing at checkers.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.590
No, I was just in the neighborhood,

21:37.591 --> 21:39.343
so I figured I'd drop in.

21:39.344 --> 21:40.596
How was Philadelphia?

21:40.597 --> 21:42.141
Philadelphia was the worst.

21:42.142 --> 21:43.936
Someone stole my magazine on the bus,

21:43.937 --> 21:45.647
and I made the crack
in the Liberty Bell bigger.

21:45.648 --> 21:47.151
And Ben was lying about the job
the entire time,

21:47.152 --> 21:48.653
and then an Eagles fan stabbed me,

21:48.654 --> 21:49.907
and then I witness the destruction

21:49.908 --> 21:51.743
of my best friend's marriage.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.290
So this means you're not
moving to Philadelphia?

21:54.291 --> 21:57.171
No, I can't. I can't move the dogs

21:57.172 --> 21:59.802
in the middle of the school year.

22:05.730 --> 22:07.817
- Ow!
- Down, down, down!

22:12.912 --> 22:16.209
Pamela, can you book
a pedicure for me this weekend?

22:16.210 --> 22:18.630
And I don't want the man.

22:20.218 --> 22:21.594
You don't need to come in here.

22:21.595 --> 22:23.431
I just... I don't want Doug.

22:23.432 --> 22:25.018
Hey, Cliff.

22:25.019 --> 22:27.148
Guess who needs a divorce attorney.

22:28.276 --> 22:29.821
Oh, dear God.

22:31.240 --> 22:32.492
Go to bed.
