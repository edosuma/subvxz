00:05.969 --> 00:07.762
Silence!

00:07.764 --> 00:11.866
You two.
You have been here for hours,

00:11.868 --> 00:14.903
having sex with tons of ladies in masks.

00:14.905 --> 00:19.040
Yet it seems you do not
have permission to be here.

00:19.042 --> 00:20.442
Hi.

00:20.444 --> 00:22.744
- Uh, I'm Seth.
- Hi, I'm Matt.

00:22.746 --> 00:25.447
- Why are you here?
- We heard this was the place

00:25.449 --> 00:27.996
- to get "Robot Chicken" un-canceled.
- But when we got here,

00:27.997 --> 00:29.417
everyone was [bleep] so we were

00:29.419 --> 00:31.534
like, "oh, okay, I guess
we'll just start

00:31.641 --> 00:33.688
- [Bleep] these people."
- We almost felt obligated

00:33.690 --> 00:35.190
- to start [bleep].
- Quiet!

00:35.192 --> 00:39.327
In addition to hosting
elaborate orgies, we do un-cancel

00:39.329 --> 00:41.696
- television shows.
- Awesome!

00:41.698 --> 00:44.154
- Can we get our show un-canceled?
- Yes ...

00:44.324 --> 00:47.535
- if you know the password.
- Both: Fidelio.

00:47.537 --> 00:50.071
That is correct.
Congratulations.

00:50.073 --> 00:52.874
"Robot Chicken" is back on the air.

00:52.876 --> 00:55.227
<i>Both: Thank you, sir.</i>

00:55.228 --> 00:58.634
Now, what is the password to leave?

00:59.051 --> 01:03.151
- Both: Fidelio?
- The password to leave is different.

01:03.153 --> 01:06.255
- Oh, right. Fidelio.
- I just told you

01:06.316 --> 01:08.323
- the password to leave ...
- Fidelio?

01:08.325 --> 01:10.091
No! Again, I told you ...

01:10.093 --> 01:12.327
- Fidelio?
- You're missing what I ...

01:12.329 --> 01:14.395
- Fidelio?
- Please understand that

01:14.397 --> 01:16.829
"Fidelio" is not the password.

01:16.830 --> 01:20.928
If you say "Fidelio,"
that will be incorrect.

01:20.963 --> 01:25.073
- Do you understand this basic concept?
- Yeah, of course.

01:25.075 --> 01:29.644
- Sure, sure, sure.
- Now, what is the password

01:29.646 --> 01:31.312
- to leave?
- Fidelio?

01:31.314 --> 01:33.114
[Bleep] it. Kill them.

01:35.209 --> 01:38.589
- Just like Saigon, 1983.
- With a dash of ...

01:38.624 --> 01:42.924
- Wait, when were you in Saigon?
- Duck!

01:42.926 --> 01:45.994
- Aw, no, he touched my dick.
- Your dick touched my hand.

01:45.996 --> 01:47.563
I totally touched his dick.

01:47.564 --> 01:50.798
- [Bleep] it.
- [Bleep] it.

02:02.946 --> 02:05.246
Aah, didn't think that through.

02:15.959 --> 02:18.426
Please, have mercy.

02:18.428 --> 02:20.295
Sure thing. How
about we give you to

02:20.297 --> 02:22.530
- the count of...
- Both: Fidelio?

02:38.139 --> 02:40.515
<i>It's alive!</i>

02:58.606 --> 03:01.387
<b>7x01 - G.I. Jogurt</b>

03:29.442 --> 03:34.902
<i>The half-pound smurf burger.
Only at Gargl's Jr.</i>

03:34.904 --> 03:38.573
<i>All: We make holes in teeth!
We make holes in teeth!</i>

03:38.575 --> 03:41.943
Hey, maybe we should
communicate with the humans.

03:41.945 --> 03:45.965
What do we get out of making
all of these cavities, anyway?

03:47.659 --> 03:51.452
<i>Both: We make holes in teeth!
We make holes in teeth!</i>

03:51.454 --> 03:55.089
Wait, your stinger's caught!

03:55.091 --> 03:58.326
Our one method of self
defense is also fatal to us.

03:58.328 --> 04:00.373
Does god hate bees?

04:01.398 --> 04:03.131
That's right.
[Bleep] you, bees.

04:03.133 --> 04:05.900
[Bleep] me?
N-N-No. [Bleep] you!

04:12.042 --> 04:15.743
What the [bleep]?
This is not my house.

04:15.744 --> 04:18.274
It's Centaur.
From Narnia!

04:19.629 --> 04:22.750
- I'm horny. You 18?
- No, sir.

04:24.112 --> 04:25.319
Damn it!

04:25.321 --> 04:27.522
Becky? Hey, come over.

04:27.524 --> 04:30.258
I want to sex someone.

04:30.260 --> 04:34.395
Hello?
Mermaid hoe bag!

04:34.854 --> 04:37.331
- Did you just call me "gay"?
- No, I didn't say anything.

04:37.333 --> 04:40.301
My parents' divorce
messed me up, man.

04:40.303 --> 04:43.455
It messed my head up bad!

04:46.609 --> 04:48.543
I want chipotle.

04:50.483 --> 04:53.114
Lock that shit.

04:56.835 --> 04:59.754
<i>No, bro.
No, no, come on, bro.</i>

04:59.756 --> 05:02.356
<i>No, bro!  No!</i>

05:02.358 --> 05:04.592
The dog's arthritis
gives him constant pain.

05:04.594 --> 05:06.427
- We'll have to put him down.
- What?

05:06.429 --> 05:08.529
You do know that the
life span of a cat is longer

05:08.531 --> 05:11.160
than a dog, right?
W-With all due respect, you

05:11.195 --> 05:12.867

05:56.658 --> 05:59.580
Jafar, why are you so evil?

05:59.582 --> 06:03.184
Well, Iago, since every other
Disney villain got a song

06:03.186 --> 06:06.687
to explain themselves, I'll tell you.

06:06.689 --> 06:10.392
- # I... was... ...molested #
- Cut!

06:10.656 --> 06:11.559
S-Snake.

06:11.561 --> 06:13.628
Oh, yes.
That's my pet snake.

06:13.630 --> 06:16.898
I hate snakes.
Why did it have to be snakes?

06:16.900 --> 06:18.888
I hate sssome dude's ballsss.

06:18.889 --> 06:21.870
Why did it have to be
some dude's ballsss?

06:22.641 --> 06:25.442
Graduating seniors of Hogwarts,

06:25.477 --> 06:28.543
as the sorting hat placed
you into your houses, now

06:28.545 --> 06:32.613
the guidance counselor hat will
send you off into the world.

06:32.615 --> 06:34.415
All right, let's make this fast.

06:34.417 --> 06:36.551
I'm parked in a loading zone.

06:36.553 --> 06:39.854
Who gets a C-minus in Quidditch?
Here's what I see for you, kid.

06:39.856 --> 06:42.176
Two years of online college, and then...

06:42.177 --> 06:46.146
<i>living at home well into your 30s.</i>

06:46.181 --> 06:49.864
Damn, you grew up hot.
Whoa! You know what they say ...

06:49.866 --> 06:52.133
[Bleep] a Hufflepuff,
marry a Gryffindor.

06:52.135 --> 06:54.536
All right, here's the deal, hon.

06:54.537 --> 06:58.340
<i>CPK hostess/escort on weekends.</i>

06:58.341 --> 07:02.294
Harry Potter?
Dude, honestly, you nailed it.

07:02.295 --> 07:05.967
Get out of here and
win at life while you

07:05.968 --> 07:08.416
<i> drown in [bleep] thing.</i>

07:08.418 --> 07:13.967
If he's drowning in [bleep] thing
sign me up for lifeguard duty.

07:14.769 --> 07:17.625
If I'm going down with the
Titanic, I'm going to die in my

07:17.627 --> 07:21.092
motorcar, like a gentleman
of wealth and dist...

07:21.172 --> 07:24.699
- Ah! I just sat in [bleep]!
- Chow time, boys.

07:24.701 --> 07:27.235
- Come and get it.
- Hey, cooky, where'd you get

07:27.237 --> 07:29.937
- this picante sauce?
- New York City.

07:29.939 --> 07:32.766
<i> New York City?!</i>

07:38.114 --> 07:41.349
<i>I don't know why a 7-Year-Old

07:44.153 --> 07:47.378
<i>- half the battle.
- # G. I. Joe #</i>

07:47.413 --> 07:52.297
And the Emmy for best PSA by
a paramilitary organization goes to...

07:52.332 --> 07:55.096
<i>G. I. Joe, for
"don't be a turkey on Thanksgiving."</i>

07:55.098 --> 07:58.599
Look at them, Destro.
The Joes churn out pedestrian

07:58.601 --> 08:01.903
advice to dead-eyed children,
and the public eats it up!

08:01.905 --> 08:04.805
"Hey, kids, don't play with
fallen electrical lines."

08:04.807 --> 08:07.341
Reads like a dispatch
from the no-shit clinic.

08:07.343 --> 08:09.977
- I'll get the nerve gas.
- No, you fool.

08:10.012 --> 08:11.855
We'll beat them at their own game.

08:11.890 --> 08:14.120
We'll create our own PSAs!

08:14.121 --> 08:16.350
Okay, okay, let's just throw

08:16.352 --> 08:19.553
some ideas out there.
This is a safe, creative place.

08:19.555 --> 08:22.857
- Dr. Mindbender, go.
- Well, I thought our PSA could

08:22.859 --> 08:25.026
communicate an idea non-verbally.

08:25.028 --> 08:28.529
I've discovered that painting
directly on celluloid creates

08:28.531 --> 08:31.766
- a sort of "tone poem."
- Holy shit, that's sounds

08:31.768 --> 08:34.135
terrible. I'm sorry ...
safe place ...

08:34.136 --> 08:35.903
but holy shit,
that was [bleep] dumb.

08:35.905 --> 08:38.306
- Next!
- Oh, I forgot you guys were in

08:38.308 --> 08:41.241
here writing. I was
just looking for a hammer

08:41.244 --> 08:44.679
to hang my degree in screen
writing from Aberdeen.

08:44.681 --> 08:49.217
Anything I can do for
you while I'm in here?

08:49.619 --> 08:52.928
- Destro?
- She's actually really funny,

08:52.963 --> 08:54.913
- you guys.
- Hey, you lost me at "she's."

08:54.948 --> 08:58.053
[Bleep] it.
We're doing it without a script.

08:58.261 --> 09:01.662
Dr. Mindbender, you found
four young children

09:01.664 --> 09:04.435
- for our PSAs.
- Uh... Yes.

09:04.470 --> 09:07.134
That is what these
kidnapped children are for.

09:07.136 --> 09:09.421
Okay, Storm Shadow, these
two children will be running

09:09.422 --> 09:11.706
with scissors. Now, this
upsets you, and you ...

09:11.708 --> 09:14.908
- Why?
- It's dangerous to run with scissors.

09:14.943 --> 09:17.325
I run with Katana.
Is that not dangerous?

09:17.326 --> 09:20.982
Wow, I hadn't thought of that.
Excellent point, Storm Shadow.

09:20.984 --> 09:22.450
Get this piece of shit off my set.

09:25.362 --> 09:28.371
Well, Cobra Commander, looks
like I owe you an apology.

09:28.406 --> 09:31.258
So, remember, only take
supplies if you'll use them

09:31.260 --> 09:34.295
for post-office business.
Any other use is a felony.

09:34.297 --> 09:37.531
- Now I'm aware.
- And awareness is the second

09:37.533 --> 09:39.934
50% of the conflict in question.

09:42.946 --> 09:46.674
- Somebody say [bleep] "cut."
- And I think you'll find it's

09:46.676 --> 09:49.761
not hard to read when you take the time

09:49.810 --> 09:55.049
to sssssssssound it out.

09:55.051 --> 09:58.719
Oh, yesss, I've got a
sssmall ssspeech impediment.

09:58.721 --> 10:02.037
<i>It'sss not funny!</i>

10:05.094 --> 10:07.729
<i>Shut... it... down.</i>

10:08.400 --> 10:13.846
And the Emmy for best PSA by
a paramilitary organization goes to...

10:13.847 --> 10:17.628
G.I. Joe, for
"don't star in a Cobra PSA."

10:17.629 --> 10:20.658
- What?
- Pop the nerve gas!
