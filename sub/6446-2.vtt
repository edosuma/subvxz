WEBVTT

00:05.506 --> 00:08.873
CLARK: Lois, you've had a near-death
experience. You should be resting.

00:09.051 --> 00:10.916
What are we doing out here?

00:11.136 --> 00:13.923
LOIS:
I'm going to ﬁnd out what Lex is up to.

00:14.098 --> 00:16.805
Clark, you, on the other hand,
are not required to attend.

00:16.975 --> 00:19.967
After what happened to Lana,
why didn't you take Chloe's offer...

00:20.145 --> 00:23.512
-...and hang out with her at the Talon?
-lt's dangerous out here.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.558
Keeping you out of trouble
has become a bad habit of mine.

00:26.735 --> 00:30.444
Besides, it gives me a good opportunity
to say goodbye.

00:30.781 --> 00:33.898
You can't break up with me, Clark.
We're not even a couple.

00:34.952 --> 00:37.364
Lois, I'm leaving Smallville...

00:37.621 --> 00:39.737
...after Lana's funeral.

00:41.959 --> 00:45.872
Wow. Didn't see that coming.
Where are you running away to?

00:46.672 --> 00:50.164
Up north. There's something I need to do.

00:50.634 --> 00:53.376
What about the farm?
You can't let the corn die on the vine.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.387
My neighbor, Ben Hubbard,
he's gonna run things for a while.

00:58.392 --> 01:01.509
What's wrong, Lois? I thought
you'd be happy to get rid of me.

01:01.687 --> 01:04.474
Are you kidding?
Who am I gonna pick on?

01:04.648 --> 01:06.889
I'm sure you'll ﬁnd someone.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.769
Now, which direction
did you enter the dam from?

01:11.947 --> 01:14.484
Southeast. Follow me.

01:19.663 --> 01:21.949
What is that?

01:23.917 --> 01:26.078
Holy crap, this is amazing.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.505
Check this out, Clark.

01:33.177 --> 01:36.715
Oh, my God.
What do you think this is?

01:36.889 --> 01:39.676
Lois, it's probably just some sort
of experimental airplane.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.216
Then why aren't there any windows?

01:42.644 --> 01:44.350
And those symbols...

01:45.022 --> 01:47.764
...they aren't like any airline logos
I've ever seen.

01:47.941 --> 01:51.684
If you ask me,
we're looking at a real live spaceship.

01:51.862 --> 01:55.525
Come on, Lois. You and I both know
that they don't really exist.

01:56.158 --> 02:00.026
And based on this algae, it looks like
it's been undenNater for a while.

02:14.092 --> 02:17.710
That's what happens
when you touch my stuff.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.772
[G ROANS]

02:32.444 --> 02:37.609
Go get your girlfriend
and don't ever come back.

04:25.641 --> 04:28.758
-l'm serious, you need to go to the hospital.
-For this little bump?

04:28.936 --> 04:31.803
My head has been bonked harder than that.
Where's my laptop?

04:31.980 --> 04:35.188
-What happened to you guys?
-You're gonna lock me in the loony bin...

04:35.359 --> 04:39.022
...when I tell you this,
but Clark and | just saw a spaceship.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.363
Lois' imagination has ﬁnally kicked
into overdrive.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.275
It was probably just some Styrofoam prop
for a school play.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.284
Right. That makes sense, actually.

04:48.455 --> 04:52.448
Okay, but the world | live in, school props
don't knock people unconscious.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.743
-l'm thinking a force ﬁeld.
-How many times do I have to tell you?

04:55.921 --> 04:59.129
You slipped in the mud, you hit your head
on a rock. I helped you to your feet.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.041
-Why do you think I've got mud all over?
LOIS: I know what I saw.

05:02.219 --> 05:05.052
Once I change clothes,
I'm going straight to The Inquisitor.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.508
My editor is gonna ﬂip.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.426
-Tell me she's just seeing things.
-lt's what she didn't see.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.890
A Kryptonian girl with blond hair
and a bad attitude.

05:15.065 --> 05:17.306
She moved so fast,
Lois didn't know what hit her.

05:17.484 --> 05:21.648
-A Kryptonian attacked Lois?
-Yeah. Right before she came after me.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.689
Chloe, not only is she as strong as I am...

05:24.866 --> 05:26.481
...she can ﬂy.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.070
Whoa.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.281
Sounds like we got a true-blue super girl.

05:30.455 --> 05:33.162
Deﬁne "super." Nearly every Kryptonian
I've come across...

05:33.333 --> 05:36.450
-...has turned into a cold-blooded killer.
-What is with you people?

05:36.628 --> 05:39.415
Are you the only half-decent member
of your Kryptonian race?

05:40.966 --> 05:44.049
Listen, I gotta go back to the dam.
If you can—

05:45.137 --> 05:49.176
Wow. A lot of painkillers for someone
who's not feeling any pain.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.805
It's just a little headache.

05:50.976 --> 05:53.683
By the time I get back to the The Inquisitor,
I'll be good.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.561
You lost consciousness.
You could have a concussion.

05:56.732 --> 05:59.565
I'll let you know if I see double
when I'm typing my story.

05:59.735 --> 06:02.852
You know what? No, I'm sorry.
After everything we've been through...

06:03.030 --> 06:07.239
...l'm not letting you put yourself in danger.
I'm taking you to the hospital.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.983
-Okay.
CHLOE: Okay.

06:10.162 --> 06:13.120
LOIS: But 10 minutes and I'm gone.
I don't have time to sit around...

06:13.290 --> 06:15.406
...in a waiting room just....

06:26.428 --> 06:28.339
MAN:
Open 14.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.968
Well, I'm glad someone
has something to smile about.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.638
This smile means
you've been cleared of all charges.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.102
You're a free man, Mr. Luthor.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.147
-On what grounds?
-They caught the killer.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.441
A disgruntled employee
from your tunnel crew...

06:50.619 --> 06:53.156
...claimed he got cancer
from the chemicals down there.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.993
He blew up my wife to get back at me?

06:57.167 --> 06:59.704
That's what he said in his confession.

07:00.629 --> 07:03.166
Come on, let's get out of this cage.

07:03.715 --> 07:06.047
I'll buy you a big, juicy porterhouse.

07:06.218 --> 07:07.674
He didn't do it.

07:07.844 --> 07:11.177
Lex, they found his ﬁngerprints
at the scene.

07:11.348 --> 07:14.465
-He confessed to the crime.
-I don't care what evidence there is...

07:14.643 --> 07:16.508
...the man did not murder my wife.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.597
-As your attomey--
-As my attorney...

07:18.772 --> 07:22.390
...I want you to set up a meeting
with this disgruntled employee.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.354
-I wanna hear it from him.
-What's the point?

07:26.947 --> 07:29.359
I'm not sure Lana's dead.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.620
MAN:
Got anything?

07:48.135 --> 07:51.298
Move along, sir. This is a crime scene.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.362
Hold it. Hold it.

08:24.045 --> 08:28.084
Lex, I thought you'd be sharpening
your shiv behind bars by now.

08:28.258 --> 08:29.839
Someone else confessed.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.836
Once again a Luthor snake
manages to slither away...

08:34.014 --> 08:36.050
...from the grip ofjustice.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.931
How much did you have to pay
this poor guy?

08:39.519 --> 08:41.760
I didn't pay him anything.

08:41.938 --> 08:45.305
Apparently my father did
before he disappeared.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.271
The man who confessed
happens to be dying of cancer.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.185
He wanted his family taken care of.

08:50.363 --> 08:54.026
It doesn't matter what sleight of hand
you pulled, it's not bringing Lana back.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.362
What if she isn't dead, Chloe?

08:56.995 --> 08:58.451
Lex, you're already free.

08:58.622 --> 09:02.365
You don't need to keep coming up
with more convoluted conspiracy theories.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.955
As you probably know,
before Lana died...

09:06.129 --> 09:09.621
...she managed to steal
highly classiﬁed research from me.

09:09.799 --> 09:14.338
Lana's remains have all been positively ID'd,
down to every last strand of DNA.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.924
I'm well aware of the DNA evidence.

09:17.098 --> 09:21.011
Look, Chloe, you're Lana's best friend.
If she told anyone her plan, it would be you.

09:24.147 --> 09:26.263
Tell me, Chloe.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.306
Tell me everything you know.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.897
Here's everything I know, Lex.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.733
You need some serious psychiatry.

09:49.798 --> 09:52.255
-Hey, you all right?
-Yeah, I'm ﬁne.

09:52.425 --> 09:56.338
But your little Kryptonian gal pal's
been showing up all over Lowell County.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.845
Have you seen her
since she went all space shuttle?

09:59.015 --> 10:01.392
No, but I found her victims.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.263
Two dead park rangers
right where her ship used to be.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.399
I need to ﬁnd her
before she hurts someone else.

10:08.566 --> 10:12.354
Well, I think she's still grounded,
considering these 911 calls coming in.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.360
Three preschools called and reported...

10:14.531 --> 10:17.193
...some blond woman storming in,
scaring the children.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.865
Where was she last seen?

10:24.958 --> 10:27.040
[SWOOSHING]

10:29.379 --> 10:31.119
What's your name?

10:33.383 --> 10:35.465
It's okay, I won't hurt you.

10:36.219 --> 10:37.459
Cody.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.267
What about you? What's your name?

10:46.438 --> 10:47.894
[SWOOSHING]

10:48.064 --> 10:49.770
Whatever you're doing, it stops now.

10:49.941 --> 10:52.102
You again. Following me?

11:01.161 --> 11:02.776
Humans can't move that fast.

11:02.954 --> 11:05.491
-Who are you?
-It doesn't matter.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.747
I'm not gonna let you kill
one more person.

11:09.002 --> 11:12.290
I haven't killed anyone. At least, not yet.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.287
But you're starting to tempt me.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.934
You wanna tell me
what you're doing on Earth?

11:31.066 --> 11:32.772
You can trust me.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.075
Looking for a small boy.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.107
I've searched everywhere with no luck.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.948
This boy have a name?

11:47.749 --> 11:49.410
Kal-El.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.958
A spaceship is not gonna send your career
into the stratosphere.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.922
It'lI embarrass you.

12:02.097 --> 12:04.133
It's the truth.
I saw it with my own eyes.

12:04.307 --> 12:08.175
Lois, you don't know what you saw.
I'm still trying to resuscitate my credibility...

12:08.353 --> 12:11.561
...after writing about the Smallville
believe-it-or-not set.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.440
We are talking about an alien invasion.
Two men are dead.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.602
If you were there, you'd be clacking
on the keyboard as we speak.

12:18.780 --> 12:22.864
Not now. The Daily Planetjust hired a new
editor wonder-boy from the Star City Post.

12:23.034 --> 12:25.867
And spaceships are not the stuff
of good ﬁrst impressions.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.993
Did I hear someone say "spaceship"?

12:28.998 --> 12:31.330
Didn't anyone teach you
that eavesdropping is rude?

12:31.501 --> 12:33.833
Eavesdropping is my livelihood.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.504
Grant Gabriel, your new editor.

12:35.672 --> 12:38.835
Actually, she doesn't work here.
I do. l'm Chloe—

12:39.008 --> 12:42.171
Anne Sullivan. Former editor
of the Smallville High Torch.

12:42.345 --> 12:46.714
Taking Met U journalism classes by night
while writing ﬁller stories...

12:46.891 --> 12:50.008
...sandwiched between sofa ads, by day.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.686
-Tell me about your close encounter.
-I can't share a trade secret.

12:53.857 --> 12:55.939
I work for your rival, The Inquisitor.

12:56.317 --> 12:59.059
Our rival. This is the Daily Planet...

12:59.237 --> 13:02.604
...read in virtually every country
across the globe. We have no rival.

13:03.241 --> 13:06.699
It's true. Besides, the Planet
wouldn't publish a story like that anyway.

13:06.870 --> 13:08.986
See, that's the kind
of old-guard thinking...

13:09.164 --> 13:12.622
...that's putting newspapers in the crapper
all around this country.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.416
Since when is truth in journalism
old guard?

13:15.712 --> 13:18.249
Well, she said it's true. I believe her.

13:19.924 --> 13:24.213
I'll tell you what. You deliver me your
spaceship story, a story that'll sell papers...

13:24.387 --> 13:26.298
...and you've got yourself a job here.

13:28.099 --> 13:31.387
-Are you serious?
-Do I sound like I'm joking?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.200
You can't be KaI-EI.

13:49.370 --> 13:52.407
He's a sweet, chubby baby who laughed
when you tickled his feet.

13:53.791 --> 13:58.080
-You knew me on Krypton?
-Yeah, I used to watch over you.

13:58.713 --> 14:01.580
I don't understand.
I mean, I left the planet right after you.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.170
We were on the same trajectory.

14:05.678 --> 14:09.091
Your ship, it seemed to be underwater
for a long time.

14:09.265 --> 14:12.928
You must have crash-landed during
the meteor shower, into the reservoir.

14:13.102 --> 14:16.310
When the dam broke,
it ﬁnally brought you to the surface.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.523
How long was I in suspended animation?

14:21.569 --> 14:22.854
Eighteen years.

14:25.615 --> 14:29.984
My embedded learning programs
covered a lot of scenarios, but this...

14:30.245 --> 14:32.281
...clearly wasn't one of them.

14:34.249 --> 14:36.786
Kara, why are you searching for me?

14:37.919 --> 14:40.956
My father, Zor-EI, told me to ﬁnd you.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.621
-That was my mission.
-Zor-El?

14:44.926 --> 14:47.133
Zor-EI and Jor-El are brothers.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.388
Then that makes us...

14:52.225 --> 14:53.510
...cousins.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.552
Jor-El never mentioned your dad.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.640
He and his brother never talked.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.063
Why?

15:04.195 --> 15:08.404
The House of El has a lot of family secrets
that nobody ever discussed.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.575
As humans would say, we were...

15:13.871 --> 15:15.657
...dysfunctional.

15:18.501 --> 15:22.665
Look, I'm sure you have a lot of questions,
but right now we need to ﬁnd my ship.

15:23.089 --> 15:26.001
I'd do it myself but those green rocks,
they keep weakening me.

15:26.175 --> 15:29.667
And trust me,
you wanna stay away from them.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.675
If you're around them too long,
they can kill you.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.007
Kill me?

15:37.020 --> 15:42.014
Zor-EI told me the yellow sun would give me
abilities beyond my wildest dreams...

15:42.191 --> 15:44.853
...but he deﬁnitely never mentioned
any fatal weaknesses.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.689
That's because he didn't know.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.979
The green rocks,
they're called kryptonite.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.694
Radioactive pieces of our home world.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.739
How did pieces of Krypton
travel 23 galaxies?

16:01.169 --> 16:02.875
You don't know what happened.

16:03.046 --> 16:06.880
Well, I know we were in the midst
of a global civil war led by General Zod.

16:07.258 --> 16:10.500
Zor-EI told me that Krypton's salvation
was on Earth...

16:10.678 --> 16:12.919
...and that you and I were the key.

16:14.182 --> 16:15.888
I hope we're not too late.

16:18.686 --> 16:21.098
Kara, Krypton is gone.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.397
What do you mean, gone?

16:28.071 --> 16:30.107
It exploded.

Let me tell you something, Lane.

19:44.058 --> 19:46.765
Newspapers don't have feelings,
they have stories.

19:46.936 --> 19:50.053

You're using some high moral ground
to bail out of a sinking ship.

who supplied me with these.

driving from the dam...

No, that looks like passion.

from the rest of the pack.

Well, yeah, if it's opened.
There's an alarm.

34:12.884 --> 34:16.297
Maybe if I had had my abilities on Krypton,
I could have saved it.

34:17.180 --> 34:19.637
You saved a lot of people here today.

34:19.975 --> 34:21.431
You should feel good about that.

34:21.601 --> 34:25.469
No, it's different for you, Kal-El.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.768
You don't have any memory of Krypton.

34:29.651 --> 34:31.312
This has always been your home.

34:33.822 --> 34:35.813
Well, then be my memory.

34:37.451 --> 34:38.816
Tell me about my family.

34:42.330 --> 34:45.458
It's hazy from all those years asleep
in the ship.

34:46.668 --> 34:48.704
I do remember some.

34:52.549 --> 34:56.588
I used to sneak away from Kandor
and come and see Lara.

34:57.679 --> 34:59.840
She always made me smile.

35:01.516 --> 35:02.596
You knew my mom?

35:03.018 --> 35:05.555
The day she found out
she was pregnant...

35:06.354 --> 35:08.094
...l'd never seen her so happy.

35:09.691 --> 35:11.306
You were so cute.

35:12.736 --> 35:14.977
You were her miracle baby.

35:20.994 --> 35:22.530
Now she's gone.

35:23.288 --> 35:24.994
My parents are gone.

35:25.874 --> 35:28.240
The entire House of El.

35:30.796 --> 35:34.414
I'll never see any of my family,
ever again.

35:43.725 --> 35:45.807
You're with family now.

35:47.729 --> 35:51.221
Look, you can stay here with me
on the farm as long as you want.

35:53.568 --> 35:56.560
You know, these humans,
they're not as bad as you think.

36:00.075 --> 36:01.736
Thank you, KaI-El.

36:05.372 --> 36:08.660
I mean, Clark.

36:13.964 --> 36:16.125
I just wish I didn't feel
like such a failure.

36:16.299 --> 36:19.541
I made my father a promise
and I couldn't keep it.

36:19.719 --> 36:21.550
Kara, that wasn't your fault.

36:21.721 --> 36:25.430
We can't always be everything our fathers
expect us to be. I know that ﬁrsthand.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.182
The way he spoke of the crystal.

36:28.520 --> 36:31.353
He told me to guard it with my life
and now it's gone.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.431
Wait. There was a crystal in that ship?

36:36.152 --> 36:39.189
With all of my directives
and the power to help me along the way.

36:40.949 --> 36:43.406
If that crystal fell into the wrong hands...

36:43.577 --> 36:45.033
...it could be disastrous.

36:45.996 --> 36:49.284
We don't have to worry about that
since it was destroyed with the ship.

36:49.457 --> 36:50.958
No.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.621
That explosion wouldn't scratch
the crystal.

36:54.087 --> 36:56.874
Only a Kryptonian can destroy it.

36:57.591 --> 37:00.082
I've searched everywhere.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.209
That crystal is gone.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.654
Hm.

37:24.576 --> 37:27.192
The spacecraft was eviscerated.

37:27.454 --> 37:29.695
But all is not lost.

37:55.315 --> 37:57.351
JOR-EL:
Kal-EI, my son...

37:57.525 --> 38:01.188
you have ﬁnally chosen
to start your training.

38:01.363 --> 38:04.821
A Kryptonian girl showed up
at my doorstep.

38:05.241 --> 38:07.368
Her name is Kara.

38:08.411 --> 38:11.118
Last time that happened
you were behind it.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.615
I know nothing of her arrival.

38:15.251 --> 38:18.459
She said she was sent here
by her father, Zor-El.

38:19.339 --> 38:22.126
You might remember him
since he's your brother.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.918
Care to tell me why you ignored
that branch of the family tree?

38:26.096 --> 38:28.212
Whatever Zor-EI wanted with you...

38:28.390 --> 38:31.803
...it was not for the greater good
of Krypton.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.968
He could not be trusted...

38:34.145 --> 38:36.227
...and neither can his daughter.

38:36.398 --> 38:38.730
You can't blame Kara for the actions
of her father.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.731
She's not here to cause any harm.

38:40.902 --> 38:44.315
That is an emotional, human reaction.

38:44.489 --> 38:48.528
Be careful of your feelings, Kal-EI.
They can betray you.

38:48.702 --> 38:52.240
My feelings are part of who I am,
whether you like it or not.

38:54.582 --> 38:56.243
Now, what about my training?

38:56.418 --> 39:00.081
Your training starts with Kara.

39:00.505 --> 39:02.917
Watch over her, Kal-El.

39:03.133 --> 39:07.297
She poses a greater threat
than you believe.

39:15.603 --> 39:17.343
Mr. Luthor.

39:17.522 --> 39:20.264
I take it you found
who you were looking for.

39:21.609 --> 39:24.567
There's someone else
I need you to locate.

MAN:
This drawing isn't much to go on, sir.

39:33.997 --> 39:35.783
It's all I have.

39:37.250 --> 39:39.707
That woman saved my life.

39:40.670 --> 39:44.458
Use whatever resources are necessary
to ﬁnd her.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.956
Is that clear?

39:47.135 --> 39:48.716
Yes, sir.
