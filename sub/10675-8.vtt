00:00.421 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:08.509 --> 00:09.760
Guys,

00:09.760 --> 00:11.262
I just found out

00:11.262 --> 00:13.304
they're having
an Olympic send-off
celebration

00:13.304 --> 00:14.555
at the park
this afternoon.

00:14.555 --> 00:16.557
Ooh, will there
be a piñata?

00:16.557 --> 00:18.849
Beause if so,
my candy-whackin' arm

00:18.849 --> 00:20.901
is locked
and loaded.

00:20.901 --> 00:22.903
It's a pep rally

00:22.903 --> 00:24.775
where fans can meet
Olympic athletes

00:24.775 --> 00:26.907
before they fly to Rio
to compete in the Games.

00:26.907 --> 00:28.489
And best of all

00:28.489 --> 00:30.111
Clutch will be there!

00:30.111 --> 00:32.032
That's awesome!

00:32.032 --> 00:33.864
I have no idea
who that is.

00:35.286 --> 00:38.369
He's only the greatest
weightlifter ever

00:38.369 --> 00:40.461
and a shoo-in
to win gold.

00:40.461 --> 00:43.664
They call him Clutch because
he always comes through
in the clutch.

00:43.664 --> 00:45.466
Also because his real name
has fourteen syllables

00:45.466 --> 00:47.168
and won't fit on the
back of a tank top.

00:48.759 --> 00:52.173
I've seen all of
Clutch's competitions.

00:52.173 --> 00:54.175
One year I even dressed up
like him for Halloween.

00:54.175 --> 00:57.178
Oliver, instead of
some meathead jock

00:57.178 --> 00:59.350
why not idolize
a real hero?

00:59.350 --> 01:00.941
Like a president,

01:00.941 --> 01:02.893
or a Nobel-winning
scientist.

01:02.893 --> 01:03.944
Or me.

01:05.986 --> 01:07.778
Or you could idolize
a cool athlete

01:07.778 --> 01:10.361
like Tom Brady.
Or me.

01:10.361 --> 01:11.822
I'm great
at foos-ball.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.536
I can't wait
to meet Clutch.

01:15.536 --> 01:17.618
Wait, what am I gonna say?

01:17.618 --> 01:18.999
What am I gonna wear?

01:18.999 --> 01:21.622
Ooh! I wonder if my
Halloween costume
still fits.

01:21.622 --> 01:23.254
Guess what,
Skylar?

01:23.254 --> 01:24.755
It's Clutch time!

01:28.129 --> 01:29.970
Was he flirting with me
or threatening me?

01:29.970 --> 01:32.173
I can never tell
his little boy energy.

01:33.804 --> 01:35.095
Yeah, don't worry
about him.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.807
He's just excited
to meet his hero

01:36.807 --> 01:38.849
who's in the
summer Olympics.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.391
Girl from another
planet question:

01:40.391 --> 01:41.892
What are the
summer Olympics?

01:41.892 --> 01:45.776
Oh, they're a series
of events for the
world's best athletes.

01:45.776 --> 01:47.027
The winner takes
a gold medal,

01:47.027 --> 01:49.440
second takes silver,
third takes bronze.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.732
Oh, yeah, they have that
where I'm from too.

01:51.732 --> 01:53.904
Except on my planet
they don't hand out medals.

01:53.904 --> 01:56.157
There if you get second
they melt down your bones

01:56.157 --> 01:57.578
to build a podium
for the winner.

01:59.240 --> 02:02.373
Anyway, our
Olympics represent

02:02.373 --> 02:04.044
sport in the
truest form.

02:04.044 --> 02:06.507
There's pageantry,
sportsmanship

02:06.507 --> 02:09.089
and super hot guys
from countries
I've never even heard of.

02:11.672 --> 02:14.715
You know, I have always wanted
to compete in the Olympics,

02:14.715 --> 02:17.218
but my bionics would give me
an unfair advantage.

02:17.218 --> 02:20.681
I could arrange for you
to compete on my planet.

02:20.681 --> 02:22.062
Yeah, I'm good.

02:23.934 --> 02:25.726
Look! It still fits!

02:28.319 --> 02:30.771
Uh, no. No,
it doesn't.

03:19.119 --> 03:21.242
This is so exciting!

03:21.242 --> 03:23.083
Clutch is gonna
be here any second.

03:23.083 --> 03:25.916
Ooh, I'm gonna have him
sign my bicep!

03:28.088 --> 03:30.040
Let's hope he has
a fine-tip pen.

03:32.463 --> 03:35.296
Cool, so no piñata.

03:35.296 --> 03:37.718
Guess I brought
this for nothing.

03:41.602 --> 03:44.555
Guys , guys, a
fencing demonstration.

03:44.555 --> 03:48.269
I just threw
away my stick.

03:48.269 --> 03:50.981
I wish I could compete
in the Olympics so bad.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.524
My laser bow would have
this thing locked up.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.986
Your laser bow would
slice them in half.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.778
Yeah, but I'd win.

04:01.452 --> 04:02.573
It's Clutch!

04:02.573 --> 04:04.625
Over here, Clutch!
I love you, Clutch!

04:05.996 --> 04:09.330
People of
Centium City,

04:09.330 --> 04:11.582
I give you...

04:11.582 --> 04:12.753
Clutch!

04:15.876 --> 04:17.588
Uh-oh, people,

04:17.588 --> 04:19.259
you know
what that means.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.302
It's time for
you to clap

04:21.302 --> 04:22.933
while Clutch
lifts heavy things.

04:26.186 --> 04:27.648
Talk about a
walk in the park.

04:31.442 --> 04:33.984
Talk about a
bike rack in the park.

04:38.158 --> 04:40.781
Talk about lifting
a hot dog cart
in the park.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.663
Hey,

04:42.663 --> 04:44.204
that's
Clutch's line.

04:46.166 --> 04:49.039
And now it's time for
Clutch to meet some of his fans!

04:52.172 --> 04:53.794
He can't see me.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.506
OK, I'm gonna have
to fight my way
through the crowd.

04:55.506 --> 04:56.797
Kaz, hold my sign.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.720
Pardon me,
coming through,
my bad.

04:59.720 --> 05:01.512
Hey, little buddy.

05:03.013 --> 05:05.386
You must be
Clutch's number
one fan.

05:05.386 --> 05:06.887
OLIVER: Yes.

05:06.887 --> 05:08.479
Yes I am.

05:08.479 --> 05:11.311
Clutch was talking
to the other
little dude, little dude.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.736
At least this guy
cared enough
to make a sign.

05:17.648 --> 05:21.241
How would you like to be
Clutch's honorary spotter
at his weight-lifting demo?

05:21.241 --> 05:22.613
Me?

05:22.613 --> 05:23.824
Yes, you.

05:24.905 --> 05:26.537
Yeah, why not?
Come on!

05:26.537 --> 05:29.790
What? No. K-Kaz.

05:29.790 --> 05:32.162
Oh, sorry, buddy.
Here's your sign back.

05:38.509 --> 05:42.463
Aw, look, it's a mini version
of the Olympics for kids.

05:42.463 --> 05:46.176
Yeah sure, let's give
everyone a chance
to compete except for Chase.

05:46.176 --> 05:49.139
Oh, look, there's a baby.
Somebody hand him a javelin!

05:50.891 --> 05:53.644
BOB: Oooh, ah, haa.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.738
Wait, is that--

05:57.738 --> 05:58.899
Bob?

05:58.899 --> 06:00.441
Bree!

06:00.441 --> 06:02.443
Why aren't you
at the academy?

06:02.443 --> 06:04.324
I heard about
this contest.

06:04.324 --> 06:07.287
Where the winner
and a friend gets to run
with the Olympic torch.

06:07.287 --> 06:09.990
I'm gonna win,
then invite Bree
to run with me.

06:09.990 --> 06:11.542
Ya know,
'cause running
is your thing.

06:13.123 --> 06:16.256
And, uh, by the way,
I'm fourteen now,

06:16.256 --> 06:18.128
in case you're
still worried about
the age difference.

06:20.130 --> 06:23.093
I'm worried about
a lot of things, and
age isn't one of them.

06:25.095 --> 06:28.599
Look, Bob, you can't
compete in this contest.

06:28.599 --> 06:30.270
You have bionics.
It'd be cheating.

06:30.270 --> 06:32.312
Yeah, but don't you see?

06:32.312 --> 06:34.184
We'll carry the
Olympic flame.

06:34.184 --> 06:36.937
Which can
never be
extinguished.

06:36.937 --> 06:39.069
Like my
love for you.

06:39.069 --> 06:40.651
Aww.

06:40.651 --> 06:42.693
So you in?
No.

06:48.909 --> 06:52.372
I can't believe Clutch
chose Kaz to be his
honorary spotter.

06:52.372 --> 06:54.204
I'm his
number one fan!

06:54.204 --> 06:57.087
I should be wiping down
his sweaty barbells.

06:57.087 --> 06:58.378
Oliver,
let it go.

06:58.378 --> 07:00.130
It's not that
big of a deal.

07:00.130 --> 07:02.092
It is a big deal!

07:02.092 --> 07:04.214
Look, I have
a secret
to tell you.

07:05.255 --> 07:06.887
At night you sneak
into my bathroom

07:06.887 --> 07:08.178
and collect
pieces of my hair?

07:08.178 --> 07:09.470
Uh, no.

07:09.470 --> 07:11.051
Not always
at night.

07:12.973 --> 07:15.015
I meant I've been
using Clutch
as motivation

07:15.015 --> 07:17.187
to help me get
better with my powers.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.359
He has his catchphrase:
"Tap the power within."

07:19.359 --> 07:20.521
Every time I feel like
I can't do something,

07:20.521 --> 07:23.403
I hear Clutch in my head
saying those words and...

07:23.403 --> 07:25.195
it makes me
want to keep going.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.867
Wow.

07:26.867 --> 07:29.530
I never realized
how important
this was to you.

07:29.530 --> 07:32.072
You should talk to
Kaz and explain it.

07:32.072 --> 07:33.333
He'll understand.

07:33.333 --> 07:35.285
I can't.

07:35.285 --> 07:36.877
He's a little
busy right now.

07:36.877 --> 07:38.338
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

07:38.338 --> 07:40.460
Higher! Lift me higher.

07:42.082 --> 07:44.254
That's my
muscle man.

07:50.180 --> 07:51.431
ANNOUNCER: Our next competitor

07:51.431 --> 07:53.353
in the Mini Olympics
shotput event,

07:53.353 --> 07:54.805
Bob!

08:02.813 --> 08:04.655
Is that good?

08:04.655 --> 08:07.067
I-I honestly have no idea
what I'm doing.

08:08.198 --> 08:09.610
Bob.

08:09.610 --> 08:11.371
What is going
on here?

08:11.371 --> 08:13.373
I thought I told you
you couldn't compete
in the Mini Olympics

08:13.373 --> 08:15.245
because
you're bionic.
I know.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.327
But my new coach
told me it was OK.

08:17.327 --> 08:18.579
What new coach?

08:18.579 --> 08:20.460
No talking to
lookie-loos.

08:20.460 --> 08:22.292
Focus, Bob.
Focus.

08:22.292 --> 08:24.625
Chase?

08:24.625 --> 08:26.256
What're you up to?

08:26.256 --> 08:29.009
Look, since I can't compete
in the real Olympics,

08:29.009 --> 08:31.592
running with the torch
is the closest I'll ever get.

08:31.592 --> 08:33.513
And when you so rudely

08:33.513 --> 08:35.015
turned Bob down,

08:35.015 --> 08:36.346
I stepped in.

08:37.477 --> 08:39.309
I'm gonna run
with the torch!

08:40.691 --> 08:42.312
No, you're not.

08:42.312 --> 08:43.443
It's totally
cheating.

08:43.443 --> 08:46.066
Ah, technically
it isn't.

08:46.066 --> 08:48.318
You see, the real Olympics
have very strict rules.

08:48.318 --> 08:51.241
But since this is just
a rinky-dink challenge for kids,

08:51.241 --> 08:53.323
the only rule is:
"Have fun."

08:53.323 --> 08:55.415
Which means
Bob can compete.

08:55.415 --> 08:57.247
OK, well it may
not be cheating,

08:57.247 --> 08:58.498
but it's still
not fair.

08:58.498 --> 09:00.330
All these kids,
they wanna win

09:00.330 --> 09:01.712
and you're crushing
their dreams.

09:01.712 --> 09:04.755
Well, yeah,
but...

09:04.755 --> 09:06.296
I'm gonna run
with the torch!

09:11.672 --> 09:14.384
Fans of Centium City!

09:14.384 --> 09:16.266
Today, Clutch is
going to do
something

09:16.266 --> 09:18.178
he's never
done before!

09:18.178 --> 09:20.310
Refer to himself
as 'I' or 'me'?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.353
Today, Clutch
is going to break

09:23.353 --> 09:25.395
his own weight
lifting record.

09:27.107 --> 09:28.649
That's right.
CROWD: Ooh.

09:28.649 --> 09:31.191
Five hundred pounds
on this side,

09:31.191 --> 09:33.654
and five hundred
pounds on that side.

09:33.654 --> 09:35.155
Together that's...

09:36.536 --> 09:38.368
Five hundred
pounds twice.

09:40.410 --> 09:43.163
Clutch, uh, that looks
kinda dangerous.

09:43.163 --> 09:44.374
Of course it's
dangerous.

09:44.374 --> 09:45.756
But as my
number one fan,

09:45.756 --> 09:47.417
you should know
that Clutch always...

09:47.417 --> 09:49.509
taps the power within.

09:49.509 --> 09:51.591
For Clutch,
nothing is
impossible.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.674
Except crossword
puzzles.

09:55.385 --> 09:58.518
All right, well,
what am I supposed
to do as your spotter?

09:58.518 --> 09:59.890
Clutch doesn't really
need a spotter.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.182
Clutch is the
strongest
man on Earth.

10:02.182 --> 10:03.684
You just need
to stand there

10:03.684 --> 10:05.395
and watch the
awesomeness

10:05.395 --> 10:07.487
that is Clutch.

10:07.487 --> 10:10.400
You just worked in
14 "Clutches"
in three minutes.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.442
Very impressive.

10:12.442 --> 10:14.284
OK, people,

10:14.284 --> 10:16.366
it's Clutch Time!

10:27.668 --> 10:29.840
Oliver, something's
wrong. He can't hold
the weight.

10:29.840 --> 10:33.804
Clutch needs help!

10:34.925 --> 10:36.556
Kaz, help him.

10:36.556 --> 10:38.849
He said I didn't have to
do anything.
I can't lift that much.

10:38.849 --> 10:40.931
I'm coming,
big guy.

10:43.854 --> 10:45.525
How are you
doing that?

10:45.525 --> 10:47.978
Oh right, sorry.
I'm bionic.

10:47.978 --> 10:49.269
Oliver, nice to
meet you.

10:49.269 --> 10:50.771
Awww!!!

10:50.771 --> 10:53.483
Oh no! Oh no!
Oh no! Oh no!

10:54.484 --> 10:56.116
Well the
good news is,

10:56.116 --> 10:58.278
he knows who
you are now.

11:07.547 --> 11:09.339
I'm the worst
fan ever.

11:09.339 --> 11:11.051
I dropped hundreds
of pounds on Clutch

11:11.051 --> 11:13.383
and shattered
every bone
in his foot.

11:13.383 --> 11:15.716
Don't sell
yourself short.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.387
You also broke
his ankle.

11:19.139 --> 11:21.221
Dude, what were
you thinking?

11:21.221 --> 11:22.392
Me?

11:22.392 --> 11:24.224
You knew Clutch
was my hero.

11:24.224 --> 11:27.147
This never would've
happened if you hadn't
stolen him away from me.

11:27.147 --> 11:29.399
Look, I'm sorry, OK?
You're right.

11:29.399 --> 11:31.401
I got swept up
in the moment.

11:31.401 --> 11:33.734
It's his muscles.
They get me every time.

11:35.866 --> 11:39.369
The worst part is
I let my hero down.

11:39.369 --> 11:41.581
I wish there was
something I could do.

11:41.581 --> 11:42.993
Maybe there is.

11:42.993 --> 11:44.034
Be right back.

11:47.627 --> 11:50.460
You abducted Clutch
from the hospital?

11:50.460 --> 11:51.711
You're welcome.

12:00.390 --> 12:01.551
Hey, guys.

12:01.551 --> 12:04.104
Say hello
to Zoe.

12:04.104 --> 12:06.646
You know, she really
wants to win
the mini Olympics,

12:06.646 --> 12:08.728
but since you two
are playing unfair,
she needs a little help.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.440
So, I'm gonna
be her coach.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.152
What?

12:12.152 --> 12:14.614
Yep, since you're
using your bionics,

12:14.614 --> 12:15.776
I'm gonna use mine

12:15.776 --> 12:18.198
to make sure
that you don't win.

12:18.198 --> 12:19.619
Isn't that
right, Zoe?

12:19.619 --> 12:21.531
I don't even
know you.

12:22.702 --> 12:25.125
I'm supposed
to be doing this
with my dad.

12:25.125 --> 12:27.457
She just grabbed
me and dragged
me over here.

12:29.629 --> 12:32.542
Well, you wanna
win, right?

12:32.542 --> 12:33.874
More than anything.

12:33.874 --> 12:36.336
Well, then I say
we show them
serious girl power.

12:36.336 --> 12:37.467
OK.

12:40.220 --> 12:42.472
I'm gonna kick
your butt.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.387
Chase,
I'm nervous.

12:49.059 --> 12:50.891
Girl power
scares me.

12:53.313 --> 12:55.315
ANNOUNCER: Next up
for the long jump,

12:55.315 --> 12:57.317
Bob!

12:57.317 --> 13:00.030
Just remember
to use your
super strength

13:00.030 --> 13:01.491
to push off.

13:05.615 --> 13:07.958
BOB: Cannonball!

13:09.329 --> 13:11.291
( thud )

13:13.003 --> 13:15.085
Where'd all the sand go?

13:17.717 --> 13:20.510
ANNOUNCER: Next up,
we have Zoe!

13:21.761 --> 13:23.093
OK,

13:23.093 --> 13:24.724
you just try to keep
your legs out in
front of you,

13:24.724 --> 13:26.636
and I'm gonna do
the rest with
my invisibility app.

13:26.636 --> 13:29.189
You ready?
Let's do this!

13:43.153 --> 13:44.704
Yay! You did it.

13:44.704 --> 13:46.576
Hey, that's
not fair.

13:46.576 --> 13:47.868
Why not?

13:47.868 --> 13:50.290
You said it yourself
the only rule
is to have fun.

13:50.290 --> 13:52.712
And I am
having a blast.

13:52.712 --> 13:53.713
Come on, Zoe.

13:53.713 --> 13:55.916
See you later,
sandman.

13:59.629 --> 14:01.341
Get Clutch
out of here.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.552
What is wrong
with you people?

14:04.804 --> 14:06.676
Why would you
bring him here?

14:06.676 --> 14:08.969
I wanted to give you
the chance to
redeem yourself.

14:08.969 --> 14:11.972
So you forced him
here against his will?

14:11.972 --> 14:13.563
I asked him
to come nicely,

14:13.563 --> 14:14.814
but he said no.

14:14.814 --> 14:17.777
So then I had to
ask him to come

14:17.777 --> 14:19.069
not so nicely.

14:21.241 --> 14:24.284
Clutch is not
having a good day.

14:25.785 --> 14:28.448
You said no regular
doctor could fix him.

14:28.448 --> 14:31.751
So I figured why not try some
of your old medical devices
from Mighty Med.

14:31.751 --> 14:34.164
Because Clutch
isn't a superhero.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.376
I wouldn't even
know where to start.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.757
Ok, I can't do this.

14:37.757 --> 14:39.759
We have to take Clutch
back to the hospital.
Wait.

14:39.759 --> 14:42.172
You're not even
gonna try to fix him?

14:42.172 --> 14:44.634
That's not the
Oliver I know.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.096
The Oliver I know

14:46.096 --> 14:48.638
would do everything
he can to help someone
he cares about.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.012
You're right,

14:52.012 --> 14:53.773
I gotta do it.

14:53.773 --> 14:55.015
For my hero.

14:55.015 --> 14:56.856
( Clutch grunting )

15:01.821 --> 15:03.733
I am a terrible spotter.

15:07.787 --> 15:09.119
ANNOUNCER: After four events,

15:09.119 --> 15:11.241
our two finalists
for the Mini Olympics

15:11.241 --> 15:12.993
are Zoe and Bob!

15:15.455 --> 15:17.127
The deciding event

15:17.127 --> 15:19.669
is a one mile race
around the park.

15:22.672 --> 15:25.925
Hey, since we've
both used our bionics
to our advantage,

15:25.925 --> 15:27.807
what do you say
in the spirit of
sportsmanship

15:27.807 --> 15:29.349
we make
this one fair?

15:29.349 --> 15:31.761
You're only saying that
because it's a race

15:31.761 --> 15:34.014
and you know I'm gonna
use my superspeed
to help Zoe win.

15:34.014 --> 15:36.816
Yeah. But I threw
in all that stuff
about sportsmanship

15:36.816 --> 15:38.478
so it's sorta legit.

15:40.690 --> 15:41.901
Nice try, Chase.

15:41.901 --> 15:45.405
Fine, go ahead
and use your superspeed...

15:45.405 --> 15:46.696
since you
obviously think

15:46.696 --> 15:48.488
that Zoe can't
win on her own.

15:48.488 --> 15:51.121
Hey, I can win
on my own!

15:51.121 --> 15:52.993
Oh, really?

15:52.993 --> 15:54.664
Because...

15:54.664 --> 15:57.247
your coach
doesn't think so.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.838
You don't?

15:58.838 --> 16:00.630
( nervous laughter )

16:00.630 --> 16:02.792
Yes, of course I do.

16:05.215 --> 16:07.387
Um, which is why

16:07.387 --> 16:08.888
Chase and I

16:08.888 --> 16:11.891
aren't use bionics
to help either
one of you.

16:11.891 --> 16:15.475
OK, Bree,
if you insist.
Yeah.

16:15.475 --> 16:19.059
ANNOUNCER: Runners,
take your marks.

16:19.059 --> 16:21.401
All right, Bob,
remember what
I told you.

16:21.401 --> 16:23.813
Keep asking Bree out
'cause it's funny?

16:25.315 --> 16:28.368
No, Bob,
"Pace yourself."

16:28.368 --> 16:30.610
But yes, you should
definitely keep
asking her out.

16:32.742 --> 16:33.783
ANNOUNCER: Get set,

16:33.783 --> 16:35.745
go.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.918
You got this, Zoe.
Yes, go, Bob.

16:38.918 --> 16:40.620
Run, run fast.

16:40.620 --> 16:42.922
Bob, you got this.

16:42.922 --> 16:45.295
You're halfway
there. Keep it
up, Zoe. Go.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.724
Run, Bob, run!

16:55.765 --> 16:57.727
There's no way
he can catch up.

16:57.727 --> 16:59.559
I gotta do
something.
Hey, no, no, no.

16:59.559 --> 17:01.101
We said we were
not going to use bionics

17:01.101 --> 17:02.312
to help our kid win.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.064
Yes, but we
never said anything

17:04.064 --> 17:06.276
about using our bionics
to make sure the other kid

17:06.276 --> 17:08.027
doesn't win.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.650
Oh, no, you don't!

17:10.650 --> 17:13.453
ANNOUNCER: Here they come
to the finish line!

17:14.454 --> 17:15.785
I'm almost there.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.577
I don't think so.

17:22.752 --> 17:24.003
I'm gonna win.

17:24.003 --> 17:25.044
I'm gonna win!

17:25.044 --> 17:26.426
Oh, no, you're not.

17:27.877 --> 17:29.929
Hey, how'd I
get back here?

17:29.929 --> 17:31.931
Stop!

17:31.931 --> 17:34.224
You stop,
stop!

17:55.745 --> 17:56.826
ANNOUNCER: And the winner is

17:56.826 --> 17:58.538
Bob!
CHASE: Yes!

17:58.538 --> 18:00.120
Yes! I won!

18:00.120 --> 18:02.332
The torch is mine!

18:03.913 --> 18:06.005
Give me that.

18:06.005 --> 18:07.837
I don't want to
run with you.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.008
What?

18:09.008 --> 18:11.471
You should run
with your dad.

18:11.471 --> 18:13.133
Really?
Yeah.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.265
You're the only one
who played fair.

18:15.265 --> 18:16.926
And besides,

18:16.926 --> 18:18.678
I've decided
to retire on top

18:18.678 --> 18:19.719
and never
run again.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.352
Fine by me.

18:22.352 --> 18:24.894
Whoo hoo!

18:24.894 --> 18:26.726
Hey,

18:26.726 --> 18:28.188
I'm really proud
of you, Bob.

18:28.188 --> 18:29.859
You did the
right thing.

18:29.859 --> 18:33.823
You know, this is
sportsmanship at
its best.

18:33.823 --> 18:35.615
Yeah.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.907
And this is my
magnetism app
at its best.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.870
ZOE: Hey!

18:40.870 --> 18:42.872
See you in Rio.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.879
We've tried every piece
of medical equipment
left over from Mighty Med.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.751
And nothing
worked.

18:51.751 --> 18:53.673
I knew I
couldn't
fix him.

18:53.673 --> 18:56.256
We still have
this industrial
brain drill.

18:58.017 --> 19:00.019
That's it, Clutch is
calling the police!

19:02.312 --> 19:03.933
Can Clutch
borrow your phone?

19:07.267 --> 19:09.979
All right, well,
I don't want this
coming down on you two.

19:09.979 --> 19:13.773
So, I'll take
the fall.

19:13.773 --> 19:16.946
I guess from now on
I'll have to
"tap the power within"

19:16.946 --> 19:18.538
my prison cell.

19:20.079 --> 19:22.952
Wait, that's it.

19:22.952 --> 19:24.834
I've to tap
the power within.

19:24.834 --> 19:26.125
What do you mean?

19:26.125 --> 19:27.997
My cryo-blast!
Injured athletes

19:27.997 --> 19:29.919
use cryo-therapy
all the time.

19:29.919 --> 19:32.502
They expose their
bodies to extremely
cold temperatures

19:32.502 --> 19:35.054
in order to
stimulate muscle
fibers and joints.

19:35.054 --> 19:36.716
Yeah,

19:36.716 --> 19:38.057
yeah, I read
about that.

19:38.057 --> 19:39.889
It speeds up
the healing
process.

19:39.889 --> 19:43.012
Exactly.
Oliver, that's
a great idea.

19:43.012 --> 19:44.264
Thanks.

19:44.264 --> 19:46.356
Now, this is a
much more
concentrated version,

19:46.356 --> 19:48.568
but I think
it can work.

19:48.568 --> 19:51.311
Yeah, I mean
what's the worst
that could happen?

19:51.311 --> 19:52.902
It could freeze
every bone in his foot

19:52.902 --> 19:54.734
and shatter
them like icicles.

19:54.734 --> 19:56.366
What?

19:58.408 --> 20:00.490
Or it could give
him severe frostbite,

20:00.490 --> 20:02.782
in which case
the entire foot
would have to be removed.

20:02.782 --> 20:04.123
What?!

20:06.125 --> 20:07.126
Do it,
Oliver.

20:07.126 --> 20:09.789
OK, here goes.
No, wait.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.884
Clutch cold.

20:15.965 --> 20:18.097
Kaz, use your fire
power to defrost him.

20:23.052 --> 20:24.724
Clutch hot.

20:35.315 --> 20:36.566
You fix Clutch.

20:37.817 --> 20:39.319
Little dude,

20:39.319 --> 20:40.860
you are
Clutch's hero.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.914
Clutch, you're
crushing the
power within.

20:52.171 --> 20:54.003
This is
so cool.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.835
Can't believe you're
actually gonna
sign my bicep.

20:58.177 --> 21:00.139
Clutch is gonna
need a fine-tip pen.

21:02.091 --> 21:03.142
I'll get it.

21:06.386 --> 21:08.648
Hey, guys,
remember Clutch?

21:08.648 --> 21:11.060
Oh, hey, Clutch.

21:11.060 --> 21:12.442
Why is he
in our house?

21:12.442 --> 21:13.443
Ah, well,

21:13.443 --> 21:14.984
Oliver shattered
his foot.

21:14.984 --> 21:17.567
And then Skylar
abducted him
from the hospital.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.949
Then we fixed him
in our top secret
command center

21:19.949 --> 21:22.241
where no one's
ever supposed
to go.

21:22.241 --> 21:23.993
So how was
your day?

21:24.994 --> 21:26.536
Great,

21:26.536 --> 21:28.578
we used our bionics
to crush the dreams
of innocent children.

21:29.579 --> 21:32.542
Wow, we really
are an Elite Force.
