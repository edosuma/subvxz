00:07.833 --> 00:09.966
Previously onSWAT...Leroy, I know he's your son,

00:10.010 --> 00:11.011
and I am not his father,

00:11.054 --> 00:12.577
but me and my moms are gonna be

00:12.621 --> 00:14.405
looking after him now. I shook the manager's hand,

00:14.449 --> 00:16.016
I told him how bad
I really wanted the job.

00:16.059 --> 00:18.018
And he just kept on
bringing up my arrest record.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.889
If you really want to provide
for this baby

00:19.932 --> 00:21.717
that you got coming,
you keep knocking on doors

00:21.760 --> 00:23.936
until somebody takes a chance
on you just like we did.

00:26.939 --> 00:29.377
Hey, son, you seen
my wallet?

00:29.420 --> 00:31.596
It's on the table, Pop.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.729
You take your medicine
this morning?

00:33.772 --> 00:35.600
Is the sky blue?Hmm.

00:35.644 --> 00:37.733
The doctor said
she ain't never seen

00:37.776 --> 00:39.387
nobody respond
to treatment as well.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.911
I am kicking cancer in the ass
and taking names, son.

00:41.954 --> 00:44.044
I guess I shouldn't
be surprised, Pop.[phone buzzing]

00:44.087 --> 00:45.741
Uh, that's your mom.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.960
She's dropping me off
at my doctor's appointment.

00:49.701 --> 00:50.920
[door closes]

00:50.963 --> 00:52.487
[Darryl mumbles]

00:52.530 --> 00:54.793
Ah, geez.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.491
Hey. What's going on, D?

00:56.534 --> 00:58.014
Heema's parents.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.929
They ain't never gonna
let me see my son.

00:59.972 --> 01:01.974
They told Heema
that I'm a bad influence

01:02.018 --> 01:03.846
and that she should
just forget about me.

01:03.889 --> 01:05.717
I've been texting and calling
for almost a year.

01:05.761 --> 01:07.893
They don't listen!Okay, you listen to me.

01:07.937 --> 01:09.895
You know I got your
back on all things,

01:09.939 --> 01:12.724
but you got to take a look
at this from their side.

01:12.768 --> 01:14.900
You got their 15-year-old
daughter pregnant,

01:14.944 --> 01:16.815
and then you landed
your little ass in juvie

01:16.859 --> 01:18.469
for being involved
in an armed robbery.

01:18.513 --> 01:20.906
Taking Heema to San Diego
to start over is them

01:20.950 --> 01:22.995
just trying to protect
her and the baby.

01:23.039 --> 01:24.910
Protect them from me?

01:24.954 --> 01:26.912
But I-I'm not that type
of kid anymore.

01:26.956 --> 01:29.654
But-- I'm back in school.
I got a job.

01:29.698 --> 01:30.916
I cleaned up my life.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.266
Okay, and I get that.

01:32.309 --> 01:34.920
I get it.
But her parents don't.

01:34.964 --> 01:37.967
You got to find some
way to show them.

01:38.010 --> 01:41.275
Look, I know you and your pops
get into it sometimes.

01:41.318 --> 01:42.928
I just don't want me and Deon

01:42.972 --> 01:44.408
to have that lifelong beef
like that.

01:44.452 --> 01:46.236
No offense.

01:46.280 --> 01:50.545
Listen, me and my pop still deal
with a lot of stuff, Darryl.

01:50.588 --> 01:51.937
I don't want Deon
growing up thinking

01:51.981 --> 01:54.766
that I don't want
to be a part of his life.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.899
Can Heema's parents really
keep me from seeing my own son?

01:56.942 --> 02:00.468
D, you're a minor with a record.

02:00.511 --> 02:03.384
Look, I know a lawyer,
she works in family court.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.560
Maybe she can
let us know the score.

02:05.603 --> 02:07.039
All right?

02:09.390 --> 02:10.826
DEACON:
Lee and Alfaro,

02:10.869 --> 02:12.567
you'll take the green room.

02:12.610 --> 02:14.351
Zach, you are concourse B.

02:14.395 --> 02:16.397
I'll be floating,
keeping an eye on each section.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.963
Guys, we're not here
to watch a fight.

02:18.007 --> 02:20.749
There will be pop stars,
congressmen, other celebs.

02:20.792 --> 02:22.403
It'll be a rowdy crowd.

02:22.446 --> 02:24.361
We oversee every security
layer, from guests

02:24.405 --> 02:27.930
with personal protection details
down to event safety guards.

02:27.973 --> 02:29.932
Everyone clear
on their assignments?

02:29.975 --> 02:31.716
All right, good. Finish your
walk-throughs and then meet Buck

02:31.760 --> 02:33.588
at the ticket office for
your Fight Night credentials.

02:33.631 --> 02:35.590
Thank you, gentlemen.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.461
I told you my guy was thorough.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.463
You can stop
selling me on him, Buck.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.465
Having Deac in the room
helped us land the gig.

02:41.509 --> 02:43.032
Gonna put us
on the map.

02:43.075 --> 02:44.773
Let's not uncork the champagne
until we've got everybody

02:44.816 --> 02:46.731
out here safe, okay?BUCK:
Okay, fine.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.820
But bottoms up
after Torres wins.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.084
Speak of the devil.

02:52.128 --> 02:54.913
Hey, champ. This is
my business partner David Kay.

02:54.957 --> 02:57.002
He's managing our security team.

02:57.046 --> 02:59.004
Meet Gio Torres,

02:59.048 --> 03:01.529
reigning welterweight champion
of the world,

03:01.572 --> 03:02.965
his wife Esther.[phone buzzing]

03:03.008 --> 03:05.794
Excuse me.
I have to take this.

03:05.837 --> 03:07.361
It's very nice
to meet you.

03:07.404 --> 03:08.579
And please, call me Deacon.

03:08.623 --> 03:11.016
¿Diácono?Like padre, priest?

03:11.060 --> 03:13.715
No, no, it's just a nickname.
No, I'm married, with four kids.

03:13.758 --> 03:14.933
It's your first?

03:14.977 --> 03:15.978
Yes.

03:16.021 --> 03:17.458
You know, this place is so...

03:17.501 --> 03:19.851
[chuckles]
...new.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.810
We had nothing like it
in Havana.

03:21.853 --> 03:23.507
One day we will.

03:23.551 --> 03:24.813
[both speak Spanish]

03:24.856 --> 03:26.641
TORRES: Sí. Well, best of luck tonight.

03:26.684 --> 03:27.729
And congratulations.

03:27.772 --> 03:29.731
Gracias, Padre.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.864
[knocking on door]

03:33.909 --> 03:35.911
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

03:35.954 --> 03:38.261
Had to hit the bank
while I had the time off.

03:38.305 --> 03:41.003
You look nice.
Interviewing for new job?

03:41.046 --> 03:42.700
Eh, come on, Mom,
please don't start with that.

03:42.744 --> 03:43.919
You know I love SWAT.

03:43.962 --> 03:45.007
Start with what?

03:45.050 --> 03:47.444
Uh, criticizing me,
my life, my job.

03:47.488 --> 03:49.403
Kind of your biggest hobby
since Dad died.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.448
I don't criticize,
I give advice.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.756
So, what brings you here?

03:54.799 --> 03:57.411
You said it was important.Yeah.

03:57.454 --> 03:59.500
Do you remember the girl
that I told you about?

03:59.543 --> 04:01.719
The same girl you've been seeing
the past couple months?

04:01.763 --> 04:03.895
Yeah, Bonnie.

04:03.939 --> 04:06.811
We've actually been together
for longer than that.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.291
We moved in together,

04:08.335 --> 04:09.988
and I think I'm ready

04:10.032 --> 04:12.339
for the gold bracelets
that Grandpa left me.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.733
My father set aside
those bracelets

04:15.777 --> 04:17.692
for you boys to give
to your brides.

04:17.735 --> 04:20.564
I know. I'm gonna ask
Bonnie to marry me.

04:20.608 --> 04:21.783
If this relationship
is-is so serious,

04:21.826 --> 04:23.741
why haven't I met Bonnie?

04:23.785 --> 04:26.353
I-I wanted you to, Ma, but,
you know, with work and all,

04:26.396 --> 04:27.615
there was never a good time.

04:28.964 --> 04:30.661
I'm your mother.

04:30.705 --> 04:32.010
It's very hurtful.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.492
When Jacob got engaged,
he did things properly.

04:35.536 --> 04:37.364
Well, maybe I put it off 'cause
I didn't want you comparing me

04:37.407 --> 04:38.800
to Jacob in front of Bonnie.

04:38.843 --> 04:40.758
Telling the woman I love
that I'm the disappointment,

04:40.802 --> 04:41.890
while he's the perfect one.

04:41.933 --> 04:43.587
What are you talking about?

04:45.067 --> 04:46.895
Can I get the bracelets or not?

04:48.505 --> 04:51.900
Those bracelets are not
for some woman I've never met.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.818
CHRIS:
Come forward.

04:56.861 --> 04:57.906

Hey.

04:59.386 --> 05:00.430
Thanks for filling in
last-minute.

05:00.474 --> 05:01.910
You really helped us
out of a jam.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.433
No need to thank me. That's what
the money's for, right?

05:03.477 --> 05:04.521
Aren't these fights

05:04.565 --> 05:06.044
usually in Vegas?Yeah.

05:06.088 --> 05:08.395
But Maxwell wanted to fight
in his own hometown.

05:08.438 --> 05:09.874
Why does the former champion
get to call the shots?

05:09.918 --> 05:11.049
That's why.

05:11.093 --> 05:13.704
Jackie Shaw?
Yeah.

05:13.748 --> 05:14.792
Biggest promoter out there.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.707
Jackie Shaw will
never let you down.

05:16.751 --> 05:18.361
He convinced Maxwell
to unretire.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.363
One last fight
on his own home turf.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.322
More like one last payday
for Shaw.
Yeah.

05:22.365 --> 05:23.366
All right,
I'm gonna make the rounds.

05:23.410 --> 05:24.585
Okay.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.678
Oi,Padre.

05:30.721 --> 05:32.549
You have four kids, right?

05:32.593 --> 05:34.725
One for each.[chuckles]: Ah.
That's the last thing

05:34.769 --> 05:36.945
you should be thinking about,
but thank you. That's very kind.

Where's the rest
of the delegation?

05:38.773 --> 05:40.775
Hotel. I said
I needed time alone.

05:40.818 --> 05:42.385
But now I need distraction.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.474
People say
I'm gonna beat Maxwell,

05:44.518 --> 05:46.868
but he was a champion, too.
A great one.

05:46.911 --> 05:50.828
And once we are in the ring,
anything can happen.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.569
But I must win.I get it.

05:52.613 --> 05:54.266
You got a whole country
pulling for you.

05:54.310 --> 05:56.399
You don't want to
let anybody down.
No.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.923
I have no choice but to win.

05:58.967 --> 06:01.926
For my people, yes.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.406
But for my family.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.757
Oi,can I sign for your team?

06:06.801 --> 06:08.585
¿Sí?Yeah.

06:08.629 --> 06:09.804
Yeah, I'm sure they'd appreciate

06:09.847 --> 06:11.545
an autograph from
the world champ.

06:11.588 --> 06:14.417
Yeah. We will see what I am
after tonight, Padre.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.723
We'll see.

Two years ago,
Maxwell's retirement

Tonight, he aims for a comeback.

The kidnappers, how much
are they asking for?

08:31.467 --> 08:32.599
They don't want his money.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.339
They want him to throw
the fight.

08:34.383 --> 08:36.167
Hey, Deac had me drive
by Torres's hotel.

08:36.211 --> 08:37.517
Security cams out front
were tampered with.

08:37.560 --> 08:38.779

No one sees a woman
seven months pregnant

08:42.609 --> 08:44.436
This operation
was well-planned.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.265
They used an online delivery
service and burner phone,

08:47.309 --> 08:48.440
all untraceable.

They've agreed to keep it
on the down low.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.755
Other than that,
Deac only told us.

08:58.799 --> 09:00.757
Well, the fight's already
a national story.

09:00.801 --> 09:03.499
The news leaks out
about this kidnapping,

09:03.543 --> 09:05.719
these punks could panic
and execute this woman.

09:05.762 --> 09:07.808
Yeah, the circle can't get
any bigger than it is.

09:13.596 --> 09:15.380
HONDO:
Lieutenant.

09:15.424 --> 09:17.469
Once you get the feds on
the line, see if they can flag

09:17.513 --> 09:19.210
any big-money wagers on Maxwell

09:19.254 --> 09:21.125
placed on gambling websites,
casino sports books...

09:21.169 --> 09:22.431
I'm on it.

09:22.474 --> 09:24.433
LUCA:
Okay, Maxwell grew
up in South L.A.

09:24.476 --> 09:26.174
There's a lots of locals
who want to see Torres lose.

09:26.217 --> 09:27.610
We need ears on the street.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.438
It's risky.

09:29.481 --> 09:31.309
We don't want to tip off
whoever's holding this woman.

09:31.353 --> 09:32.441
Commander,
we're short on options

09:32.484 --> 09:34.443
and even shorter on time.

09:34.486 --> 09:35.923
Whoever's forcing Torres
to take a dive

09:35.966 --> 09:38.273
is putting a whole lot
of stock on Maxwell.

09:38.316 --> 09:41.319
So maybe we start with
his fan base, work our way out.

09:43.887 --> 09:45.019
All right.
Get it done.

09:47.717 --> 09:49.937
What's good, Red?

09:49.980 --> 09:51.939
Hey, man, you know.
Another day, another taco.

09:51.982 --> 09:54.855
Mm. Good to see you, man.Yes, sir.

09:54.898 --> 09:56.465
Hey, you went to Fremont High
around the same time

09:56.508 --> 09:57.945
as Marlon Maxwell, right?

09:57.988 --> 09:59.947
Man, you guys are scraping
the bottom of the barrel

09:59.990 --> 10:01.078
for hookups on tickets, fellas.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.776
I mean, I barely
knew Max.

10:02.819 --> 10:05.169
He showed up to class even less
than me, and I never showed up.

10:05.213 --> 10:06.780
We ain't looking
for tickets, man.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.216
Folks around here are
pulling for him to win.

10:08.259 --> 10:09.913
Now, we want to know if you know
anyone who's pulling

10:09.957 --> 10:11.349
a little too hard,
you know what I'm saying?

10:11.393 --> 10:12.873
Talking crazy about
needing him to win?

10:12.916 --> 10:14.701
Why? He got some stalkers
or something?

10:14.744 --> 10:16.180
No, it's nothing like that.

10:16.224 --> 10:17.355
Then why you asking?

10:17.399 --> 10:18.661
Someone out there took something

10:18.705 --> 10:19.749
they shouldn't have.

10:19.793 --> 10:20.750
So what'd they steal?

10:20.794 --> 10:22.230
I can't tell you that.

10:22.273 --> 10:23.927
Who's it belong to?

10:23.971 --> 10:24.928
Can't tell you that, either.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.016
What's his name?

10:26.060 --> 10:28.105
I can't tell you that.

10:28.149 --> 10:29.716
Look, we think someone
bet heavy on Maxwell

10:29.759 --> 10:31.021
and we want to know who.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.457
Now, rumor on the street
is he used to run

10:32.501 --> 10:34.242
with a rough crowd back
in the day.

10:34.285 --> 10:36.810
[scoffs] Rough crowd, man? His
boys were straight-up killers.

10:36.853 --> 10:37.767
Still are.

10:37.811 --> 10:38.855
You know any of their names?

10:38.899 --> 10:40.030
Like I said.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.292
Wasn't my set.
HONDO:
Red, do you think

10:41.336 --> 10:43.207
you can find out
who in Maxwell's old crew

10:43.251 --> 10:44.513
kept up with him?

10:44.556 --> 10:45.688
I ain't got nothing
to offer you except an IOU,

10:45.732 --> 10:47.298
but you know
I'm good for it.
True that.

10:47.342 --> 10:50.258
Hit me back if you get anything.Sure.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.391
Is there something I should know
about this fight?

10:53.435 --> 10:54.784
Should I call my bookie?

10:54.828 --> 10:55.959
With your luck, you'll still
pick the wrong guy.

10:56.003 --> 10:57.004
Just get me some names.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.877
You seem to be moving
a lot better, Luca.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.009
Rehab doing the trick?

11:02.052 --> 11:03.750
I'm hanging in there.

11:03.793 --> 11:06.013
HONDO:
Past few months haven't
been easy on you, man.

11:06.056 --> 11:07.449
I mean, some
days are good,

11:07.492 --> 11:09.756
others, my mind and body
have different agendas,

11:09.799 --> 11:12.236
but look, whatever I can
do to help the team;

11:12.280 --> 11:13.760
if that means from HQ,
so be it, I'm in.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.544
Yeah,
we appreciate it.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.285
Can't wait to get you back out
in the field, though.Thanks, boss.

11:17.328 --> 11:19.243
I'm trying, man.

11:19.287 --> 11:22.812
I'm sorry, I really wish
I had better news.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.859
Hondo, I was just leaving.

11:25.902 --> 11:28.775
My deposition got moved up.HONDO: Okay,
no worries.

11:28.818 --> 11:31.038
Thank you for coming.Anytime.

11:31.081 --> 11:32.082
Good luck, Darryl.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.261
Yo, I'm never gonna
see Deon, man.

11:37.305 --> 11:38.349
I might as well not even try.

11:38.393 --> 11:39.873
Whoa-whoa-whoa,
calm down, D.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.091
Look, you can't have
that kind of attitude

11:41.135 --> 11:42.266
before you even start
to fight.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.138
Pop, what happened?
What'd she say?

11:44.181 --> 11:45.966
Without his name on
the birth certificate,

11:46.009 --> 11:48.664
no declaration of paternity,

11:48.708 --> 11:51.058
he's got no real legal rights
in the State of California.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.973
Even with the DNA proof
that I'm the father?

11:53.016 --> 11:54.322
I might not get
my visitation rights

11:54.365 --> 11:56.019
because of my
criminal record.

11:56.063 --> 11:58.239
That's gonna be left up
to a judge in family court

11:58.282 --> 11:59.501
if they hold it
against him or not.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.068
And I got to take a
legal paternity test.

12:01.111 --> 12:02.852
I checked. All this
costs, like, $300.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.593
And I got to
get a lawyer.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.073
Where am I gonna get
that type of money, huh?HONDO: Darryl, Darryl,

12:06.116 --> 12:08.336
listen to me.
You can save $300.

12:08.379 --> 12:10.164
Plenty of lawyers
take payment plans.

12:10.207 --> 12:12.732
The question isn't how
you're gonna pay for it.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.255
It's how much
do you really want it?

12:18.085 --> 12:19.826
[phone buzzes]

12:19.869 --> 12:21.784
Uh, look, I'm sorry,
I got to take this call.

12:21.828 --> 12:22.916
I'll meet y'all
at home later.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.918
All right.

12:24.961 --> 12:27.790
Hey, Red. Tell me you got
the names of Maxwell's old crew.

12:27.834 --> 12:31.054
Yeah, Ruben Parker,
Andre Jones and Eddie Meeks.

12:31.098 --> 12:33.274
Maxwell's looked after them
over the years.

12:33.317 --> 12:36.190
Got them jobs at Jackie Shaw's
training facility.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.931
The boxing gym on Adams?

12:37.974 --> 12:39.323
Yeah, the Mat.
But get this.

12:39.367 --> 12:42.239
My bookie said that Andre
put 200K up on Maxwell.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.328
Thinks Maxwell's
fronting the cash himself.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.289
TORRES:
What can I do to help?

12:48.332 --> 12:50.073
Your weigh-in's about to
start. If you don't show up,

12:50.117 --> 12:51.292
people will know
something's wrong.

12:51.335 --> 12:52.684
It might alert
the kidnappers.

12:52.728 --> 12:53.903
I know this is hard.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.078
But you have to go out there
and pretend

12:55.122 --> 12:56.253
that everything is normal.

12:56.297 --> 13:00.257
Tonight, we determine
the baddest

13:00.301 --> 13:01.824
welterweight on Earth.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.130
Gentlemen,
shake hands.

13:03.173 --> 13:05.132
You in my house now.
Mycity.

13:05.175 --> 13:06.829
You want to fight,

13:06.873 --> 13:09.092
you fight me.

13:09.136 --> 13:12.052
Not my family.
Not my wife.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.749
I'll fight whoever
I damn well please.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.143
And I'll tell you what...
after I knock your ass out,

13:16.186 --> 13:20.103
that wife of yours, she gonna
be crashing at my place.

13:20.147 --> 13:23.977
[Torres yelling in Spanish][crowd murmuring]

13:25.326 --> 13:27.110
Hey, hey,
save it for the ring!

13:27.154 --> 13:28.808
Save it
for the fight!

13:28.851 --> 13:30.113
What did I tell you, guys?
It's gonna be amazing!

13:30.157 --> 13:31.288
Keep eyes on Torres.

13:31.332 --> 13:33.725
I'm gonna see where
that guy's headed.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.123
Maxwell's buddies
don't say much.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.082
Guess he's the mouth
of the group.

13:42.125 --> 13:45.172
You'd think there'd be some
mention of Esther by now.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.871
You okay?

13:48.915 --> 13:52.092
Seem, uh, on edge.
And that's usually myjob.

13:52.135 --> 13:54.050
Kind of got into it with my mom
this morning.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.138
Over Bonnie.

13:55.182 --> 13:56.270
Your mom doesn't like Bonnie?

13:56.313 --> 13:57.793
Uh, she's never met her.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.882
They never met?

13:59.926 --> 14:01.188
What are you waiting for?

14:01.231 --> 14:03.016
Nothing. It's just...

14:03.059 --> 14:05.932
well, my mom's always favored
my brother Jacob.

14:05.975 --> 14:08.021
College, career,
even his wife.

14:08.064 --> 14:09.936
I don't want Bonnie
exposed to that criticism.

14:09.979 --> 14:12.155
So now your mom
feels disrespected,

14:12.199 --> 14:14.027
and she's angry at
you andBonnie.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.071
Well done.

14:15.115 --> 14:16.333
Hey, I love my mom.

14:16.377 --> 14:18.118
And I get why she's offended.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.989
But she kind of forced
this decision on me.

14:20.033 --> 14:21.904
I'm not sure I'm qualified
to give this advice,

14:21.948 --> 14:23.427
considering I sent
my own mom to prison,

14:23.471 --> 14:25.952
but my take...

14:25.995 --> 14:28.084
you want your mom and Bonnie
to have a relationship,

14:28.128 --> 14:30.913
you got to separate
your own baggage.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.002
Good or bad, just
let themsort it out.

14:33.046 --> 14:34.221
[van door opens]

14:36.049 --> 14:37.398
We got any sign
of Esther yet?

14:38.703 --> 14:40.053
How about
Maxwell's buddies?Nothing yet.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.663
Hey, hold up,
I got chatter.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.273
[indistinct voice]

14:43.317 --> 14:45.101
Can't make out
what they're saying.

14:45.145 --> 14:46.929
[man speaking Spanish]

14:46.973 --> 14:48.322
Someone in there's
speaking Spanish.

14:50.977 --> 14:54.110
It's got to be coming from
that SUV that just pulled up.

14:57.766 --> 14:59.768
Go. Move. Move.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.031
[man yelling in Spanish]Get the hell out of here!

15:02.075 --> 15:03.772
You dead!

15:03.815 --> 15:05.165
LAPD!
Hands!Drop the weapon!

15:05.208 --> 15:06.427
Drop it!
Drop the weapon!

15:06.470 --> 15:08.081
On the ground! On the ground!

15:08.124 --> 15:09.082
TAN:
Give me your hands!
Now!

15:09.125 --> 15:09.996
I said drop it!

15:13.434 --> 15:14.957
On your knees,
hands behind your head!

15:16.132 --> 15:18.656
[grunting]

15:18.700 --> 15:20.136
Stay still!
STREET:
26-David,

15:20.180 --> 15:22.095
I got two suspects
and three others

15:22.138 --> 15:23.879
detained in the gym on Adams.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.012
Who are you?

15:31.147 --> 15:34.150
You're a Cuban national.
Evelio Gomez.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.370
Are you Torres's trainer?

15:36.413 --> 15:38.241
Do something.
Find my sister!

15:38.285 --> 15:41.070
Esther is your sister? Sí.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.116
We're just trying
to get her back.

15:48.817 --> 15:50.906
[door hinges creak]

15:50.950 --> 15:52.255
[door closes]

15:52.299 --> 15:53.778
[phone ringing]

15:53.822 --> 15:55.650
Yeah, Deac, talk to me.
What's going on?

15:55.693 --> 15:57.217
There was a suspicious guy
hanging around the weigh-in.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.654
White, six foot, 25 to 30.

15:59.697 --> 16:01.003
It's probably nothing,
but I want to check it out.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.831
He walked into an old factory

16:02.874 --> 16:04.180
six blocks from the arena.

16:04.224 --> 16:06.095
Street.

16:06.139 --> 16:07.270
You got an address?

16:07.314 --> 16:08.793
Twelfth and Maple.
Northwest alley.

16:08.837 --> 16:10.491
Deacon's at
Twelfth and Maple,

16:10.534 --> 16:12.319
northwest alley.
Call for backup.DEACON: I'll keep you posted.

16:34.036 --> 16:35.995
Esther? You okay?

16:36.038 --> 16:38.127
[whimpers]

16:38.171 --> 16:41.435
I'm here to help.
Hey.

16:41.478 --> 16:43.959
[panting]
You okay?

16:44.003 --> 16:46.179
Ay,thank you.

16:47.180 --> 16:50.313
Hey, Hondo.
I found Esther.

16:50.357 --> 16:52.968
She's tied up, but she's okay.Roger that.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.015
We're coming, man.MAN: Stand up.

17:04.284 --> 17:07.635
Deacon. What's going on?
Someone there with you?

17:07.678 --> 17:08.766
I probably shouldn't
be here, huh?

17:10.290 --> 17:12.248
I followed him
from the weigh-in.

17:12.292 --> 17:13.423
I was in the room

17:13.467 --> 17:15.077
when Torres heard the message,

17:15.121 --> 17:18.428
and-and he begged me
not to do anything, but I-I,

17:18.472 --> 17:20.778
I thought if I found
his wife, you know,

17:20.822 --> 17:22.128
maybe he'd give me a reward
or something.

17:24.304 --> 17:25.957
Look...

17:26.001 --> 17:28.308
the name is Schupatz.

17:28.351 --> 17:29.961
I'm just a security guard.

17:30.005 --> 17:32.007
I don't want any trouble.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.400
Turn around.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.186
DEACON: I don't want
to cause any problems.

17:48.589 --> 17:51.200
I got his badge.

17:51.244 --> 17:52.506
This is the place, all right.

17:52.549 --> 17:54.073
Deacon ditched anything
that ID'd him as a cop

17:54.116 --> 17:55.596
before they could search him.

17:55.639 --> 17:56.727
They'll keep Esther alive
for leverage

17:56.771 --> 17:58.860
until after the fight,
but Deacon?

17:59.774 --> 18:02.820
His phone.
Looks like it got stomped.

18:02.864 --> 18:05.084
This is bad.Listen up.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.737
First off, they don't know
Deacon's a cop.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.130
Second, he doesn't
need our concern.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.045
He needs our A game.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.004
Deacon and Esther got taken
to another location.

18:13.048 --> 18:14.789
Yeah, they are in trouble,
but they are still breathing.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.537
You are okay?

18:23.580 --> 18:26.061
Yeah.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.716
Are you?

18:28.759 --> 18:32.720
They made me take medicine.
Knocked me out.

18:32.763 --> 18:33.721
You feel okay?

18:33.764 --> 18:36.115
I'm okay. I...

18:37.116 --> 18:38.639
Do you know the
men who took us?

18:38.682 --> 18:41.729
No, but help is on the way.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.078
There are people
looking for you.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.775
They'll come
for me, too.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.516
I'm a police officer.

18:49.780 --> 18:51.652
All right, we got to get
out of here.

18:51.695 --> 18:53.915
They need you alive
as leverage

18:53.958 --> 18:56.526
until your husband
loses the fight.

18:56.570 --> 18:58.049
But they'll get rid of me
soon enough.

18:58.963 --> 19:00.661
Unless we get out of here first.

19:00.704 --> 19:03.707
What can I do?

19:03.751 --> 19:06.623
Best thing you can do?
Try to stay calm.

19:07.972 --> 19:10.714
I'm gonna get us out of here.

19:10.758 --> 19:12.586
How big of a crew
we dealing with here?

19:12.629 --> 19:14.196
I couldn't make out
what they were saying,

19:14.240 --> 19:16.764
but I know I heard two
distinct voices confront Deacon

19:16.807 --> 19:18.548
before it cut off.Deacon mention anything else

19:18.592 --> 19:20.463
about this guy that
he was tracking from the arena?

19:20.507 --> 19:23.640
Just that he was white,
six foot, about 25 or 30.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.773
Well, that narrows it down
to half of Venice Beach.

19:25.816 --> 19:27.470
Okay, but here's
what's weird:

19:27.514 --> 19:30.081
He gave them a
fake name. Schupatz.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.518
Does that
mean anything to you?

19:31.561 --> 19:32.954
There's a
Mike Schupatz.

19:32.997 --> 19:35.609
Small-time smuggler. He was
one of my first arrests.

19:35.652 --> 19:36.871
He cut a deal for
a reduced sentence,

19:36.914 --> 19:38.612
worked as a CI
after he was released.

19:38.655 --> 19:40.004
That's how Deacon
knew who he was,

19:40.048 --> 19:41.745
but I'm just trying to figure
out why that was

19:41.789 --> 19:42.877
the first name
that popped into his head.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.052
Could Schupatz be
involved in this?

19:44.095 --> 19:45.662
I don't see how.
He's been back in prison

19:45.706 --> 19:47.142
for the last year.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.057
Hey, I sent Street to the arena
to link up with Chris.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.668
I told him to say that Deac's
handling a family emergency,

19:51.712 --> 19:52.887
that he was called
in to cover.

19:52.930 --> 19:54.149
It's only a
matter of time

19:54.193 --> 19:55.759
before Owen and Buck
notice he's gone.

19:55.803 --> 19:57.587
We can't let them
raise any flags, man.

19:57.631 --> 20:00.460
Tan get it done?Yeah, he's on
his way back.

20:00.503 --> 20:04.899
We had him scoop up Maxwell's
biggest fan... Jackie Shaw.

20:04.942 --> 20:06.640
Come on, Jackie,
there's hundreds of millions

20:06.683 --> 20:07.945
in bets riding
on this.

20:07.989 --> 20:09.773
You haven't put any
cash money on your guy?

20:09.817 --> 20:11.601
Not one red cent.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.647
Okay, what about Maxwell's
One-Niner pals?

20:13.690 --> 20:15.083
They place any bets
on your behalf?

20:15.126 --> 20:16.954
So that's what
this is about?

20:16.998 --> 20:18.913
A brother works his ass
off to make it big,

20:18.956 --> 20:21.481
gives a few of his
childhood friends a leg up,

20:21.524 --> 20:24.484
and now he gets attacked
with baseless allegations?

20:24.527 --> 20:26.399
What is the world
coming to?

20:26.442 --> 20:28.183
Can't we allow folks
the chance to start fresh?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.880
Okay, come on, man.
Jump off your soap box.

20:29.924 --> 20:31.447
Them boys ain't reformed.

20:31.491 --> 20:33.536
They're on your payroll,
betting big on Maxwell.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.234
I ain't my brother's keeper.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.410
Now, have I taken liberties
over the years,

20:37.453 --> 20:39.716
to move some money around,
to keep my fighters happy?

20:39.760 --> 20:40.935
We all do that.

20:40.978 --> 20:42.632
But talent is my brand.

20:42.676 --> 20:45.461
And Maxwell ain't
my only star.

20:45.505 --> 20:48.029
I got a dozen fighters
just like him in the stable.

20:48.072 --> 20:50.205
One goes, the next
one slides into place.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.555
Just like a Pez dispenser.

20:52.599 --> 20:54.862
I don't play odds,
gentlemen. I print money.

20:54.905 --> 20:56.733
Well, it seems to me
you prefer the sure thing.

20:56.777 --> 20:57.952
So is that why
you got your people

20:57.995 --> 20:59.083
trying to throw this fight?

20:59.127 --> 21:01.608
Match-fixing?
Are you kidding me?

21:01.651 --> 21:04.567
Now Jackie Shaw might not be
your flavor of ice cream,

21:04.611 --> 21:06.221
but he doesn't throw fights.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.528
Why would I get myself
banned from the sport?

21:08.571 --> 21:10.747
That's the one thing
you can't come back from.

21:10.791 --> 21:13.533
I got four houses, a yacht,
and maybe 20 years in me.

21:13.576 --> 21:15.056
You think I'm giving
all that up?

21:15.099 --> 21:16.927
Well, somebody out there
is working harder than you

21:16.971 --> 21:18.538
to make sure that
Maxwell wins this fight.

21:18.581 --> 21:20.714
Maybe so.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.455
I may not partake,

21:22.498 --> 21:24.587
but I did hear a few
seven-figure bets

21:24.631 --> 21:27.416
come across the
international wire today.

21:27.460 --> 21:29.897
Now, these ain't the gamblers
you find in a casino.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.639
I think it's because
my guy's gonna win.

21:32.682 --> 21:35.598
But maybe somebody knows
something I don't.

21:35.642 --> 21:37.513
I think you guys should be
looking over there.

21:42.562 --> 21:46.087
The medicine they made me drink,

21:46.130 --> 21:47.654
do you think it will hurt him?

21:47.697 --> 21:49.133
You know it's a boy?

21:50.613 --> 21:54.182
Nah. He'll be fine.

21:54.225 --> 21:57.577
This far along,
they're pretty resilient.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.579
You must be what,
seven months now?

21:59.622 --> 22:01.537
Eight and a half.

22:01.581 --> 22:03.409
Surprised they let you travel.

22:03.452 --> 22:06.455
We lied on my visa.

22:06.499 --> 22:07.630
Oh.

22:07.674 --> 22:10.894
We want our son
to be born in America.

22:10.938 --> 22:14.985
Cuban government can't be
too happy about that.

22:15.029 --> 22:18.641
Havana's golden boy
planting roots in the States.

22:18.685 --> 22:23.167
If our baby is born in Cuba,

22:23.211 --> 22:26.214
they have us for 18 years.

22:27.781 --> 22:29.478
Tonight was our chance.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.828
I was going to take a train
to San Francisco

22:31.872 --> 22:33.134
during the fight.

22:33.177 --> 22:34.918
We found a lawyer there.

22:34.962 --> 22:38.095
Tomorrow, my husband...

22:38.139 --> 22:40.924
will sneak away and meet us.

22:40.968 --> 22:44.014
Then...

22:44.058 --> 22:47.104
we can stay in America...
as a family.

22:48.715 --> 22:52.501
I am not scared of risk.

22:52.545 --> 22:54.764
It's why Gio fell in love
with me.

22:55.809 --> 22:58.420
Our baby can't die in here.

22:58.464 --> 23:01.380
No.

23:03.817 --> 23:05.471
[door opens]

23:18.614 --> 23:20.616
It's just water.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.618
It's okay.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.459
I think we just found
their soft spot.

23:37.503 --> 23:40.375
Hour till the bell.
No Deacon or Esther.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.594
Tell me we're closer.

23:41.637 --> 23:43.291
We're checking all bets
north of a million.

23:43.334 --> 23:45.293
A few were placed on Maxwell
from foreign accounts.

23:45.336 --> 23:46.599
Did you figure out
who's in town

23:46.642 --> 23:47.730
from this black market
jet set?

23:47.774 --> 23:49.515
Every new arrival
is credibly linked

23:49.558 --> 23:50.690
to an illegal wager.

23:50.733 --> 23:52.300
Lars Van Dyke,
suspected backer

23:52.343 --> 23:53.736
of a Belgian
human trafficking ring.

23:53.780 --> 23:56.173
The squad he flew in with
on his G5.

23:56.217 --> 23:58.306
Taj Diaz, MDMA king of Ibiza.

23:58.349 --> 24:00.613
Interpol's looking into
a series of nightclub fires

24:00.656 --> 24:02.789
after he lost a $6 million
bet at the World Cup.

24:02.832 --> 24:05.487
We've got all the names
on his flight manifest.

24:05.531 --> 24:08.751
Vlad Barkov, owner of a dying
Moscow casino franchise.

24:08.795 --> 24:10.274
Lost millions after getting
on the wrong side

24:10.318 --> 24:11.711
of the Federal Assembly.

24:11.754 --> 24:13.713
Wait, hold up, hold up.

24:13.756 --> 24:16.280
Tan, zoom in on this guy.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.284
You see that birthmark
on his forehead?

24:20.328 --> 24:21.590
The name that Deacon gave
the kidnappers

24:21.634 --> 24:24.680
when he knew I was listening.Schupatz?

24:27.553 --> 24:28.945
There's what Schupatz
looks like.

24:28.989 --> 24:30.556
LUCA:
It's the first thing
you notice on both of them.

24:30.599 --> 24:32.471
Deacon said Schupatz,
hoping it'd help you

24:32.514 --> 24:34.342
ID his captor as a guy
with a birthmark.

24:34.385 --> 24:36.344
It's gotta be.Do we know where
this crew is staying?

24:36.387 --> 24:37.824
Hotels, friends in town,
anything?

24:37.867 --> 24:39.913
Barkov and company didn't fly
halfway around the world

24:39.956 --> 24:41.610
to watch the fight
from his hotel.

24:41.654 --> 24:43.917
There's a good chance
they're in the arena.

24:43.960 --> 24:47.268
When I close my eyes, all I see
is what they're doing to her.

24:47.311 --> 24:49.357
You know, I should have
kept her by my side.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.532
Hey.
If anything happens...

24:50.576 --> 24:52.229
Don't do that.

24:52.273 --> 24:55.276
This isn't your fault.
Think of your wife.

24:55.319 --> 24:57.278
Think about how good it
would be to have her back.

24:57.321 --> 24:59.585
You want to help Esther? Sí.

24:59.628 --> 25:00.542
Then stay focused.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.196
Do your job, and we'll do ours.

25:02.239 --> 25:05.808
Okay. Okay.

25:05.852 --> 25:08.158
[door opens, closes]

25:09.377 --> 25:11.901
I saw the guy
behind this, Barkov.

25:11.945 --> 25:13.903
Where is he sitting?Luxury box.

25:13.947 --> 25:16.558
VIP section. He's got half
a dozen bodyguards around him.

25:16.602 --> 25:17.907
He keeps making phone calls.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.474
Checking in with the kidnappers.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.258
We gotta find out where Deacon
and Esther are being held

25:21.302 --> 25:22.564
without Barkov knowing.
How?

25:22.608 --> 25:24.131
Where's Hondo now?He's on his way.

25:24.174 --> 25:25.524
He said he's got a plan.

25:27.438 --> 25:28.831
[exhales sharply]

25:28.875 --> 25:30.398
[crying out]

25:30.441 --> 25:33.444
Hey, she's going into labor.
Somebody help her!

25:33.488 --> 25:34.924
[crying out]

25:34.968 --> 25:37.318
She's losing circulation.
All right? She needs help.

25:37.361 --> 25:39.276
Por favor,call doctor.

25:39.320 --> 25:42.149
Look, I'm a trained medic.
All right? Let me out of here.

25:42.192 --> 25:43.585
Let me deliver her baby.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.326
[Esther groans]

25:45.369 --> 25:47.633
Unlock him.

25:47.676 --> 25:50.723
[Esther cries out]

25:50.766 --> 25:52.681
[groaning]

25:56.598 --> 25:58.295
Do it. Help her.

26:17.488 --> 26:18.925
Her husband's gonna
lose the fight.

26:18.968 --> 26:21.318
He's gonna do whatever you want,
but she needs a doctor.

26:21.362 --> 26:22.624
Let her go.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.153
[door closes]

26:37.508 --> 26:38.945
HONDO:
You're gonna need this
to get in.

26:38.988 --> 26:41.251
CHRIS:
Thanks.

26:41.295 --> 26:42.644
Now, remember, this device
needs to be within

26:42.688 --> 26:44.559
three feet of Barkov's phone
to upload its contents.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.127
I know, for anywhere
between two to ten minutes.

26:47.170 --> 26:49.825
And if his phone moves away
mid-transfer, it won't clone.

26:49.869 --> 26:51.871
You're gonna have to abort.Got it.

26:51.914 --> 26:53.568
Chris, listen to me.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.440
Barkov's bodyguards
are well-trained.

26:56.484 --> 26:57.572
If they suspect
you're up to anything,

26:57.616 --> 26:59.095
they're gonna move fast.

26:59.139 --> 27:01.228
Now, Street's gonna be in
position right outside the box.

27:01.271 --> 27:03.622
I'm good.
All right.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.626
[indistinct chatter,
music playing]

27:09.715 --> 27:12.369
Eyes on Barkov.
Far end of the bar.

27:12.413 --> 27:13.588
Okay, standing by.

27:15.851 --> 27:18.593
Phone's in his front
right pocket.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.335
STREET [over comm]:
Three feet, no farther.

27:21.378 --> 27:23.293
Excuse me.

27:27.950 --> 27:30.474
Can I pleas have
a gin and tonic?
Yeah.

27:33.303 --> 27:34.435
It's a go.

27:34.478 --> 27:36.872
Roger that.
Upload is underway.

27:36.916 --> 27:38.831
[phone buzzing]

27:47.840 --> 27:50.538
Call me when this is finished.

27:53.715 --> 27:55.586
STREET:
how we doing, Chris?

27:55.630 --> 27:57.763
Should I make a move?

27:57.806 --> 28:00.679
Chris, should I tango?

28:06.467 --> 28:09.557
I'm gonna buy you more time.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.733
Sir, sir...
Hey, man.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.517
Hey, hey, get off me, man, get
off me.All right, relax.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.606
Come on, my buddies
are in there, bro.

28:15.650 --> 28:17.391
All right, all right,
okay. I'm leaving.
Okay.

28:17.434 --> 28:18.653
I'm leaving, all right?

41:25.918 --> 41:27.528
you got two generations
of Harrelson men

41:27.572 --> 41:29.095
right here
who have your back.

41:32.315 --> 41:34.927
That's right.

41:34.970 --> 41:37.146
Just don't ask me
to change no diapers.

41:38.278 --> 41:40.454
Hey, kid,
go get your notebook.

41:40.498 --> 41:41.977
We can make a list
of the things

41:42.021 --> 41:43.239
that we might need
to apply for visitations.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.509
Son.

41:54.250 --> 41:59.038
I appreciate you for letting me
back in your life.
