00:35.118 --> 00:37.120
<i>Come inside, take off your coat.</i>

00:37.204 --> 00:38.376
<i>I'll make you feel at home.</i>

00:40.457 --> 00:42.050
<i>Now let's pour a glass of wine</i>

00:42.125 --> 00:44.469
<i>'Cause now we're all alone.</i>

00:49.841 --> 00:51.718
Oh, my God!

00:56.515 --> 00:59.644
<i>Girl you make me feel real good.</i>

00:59.726 --> 01:01.194
That's right.

01:02.521 --> 01:03.568
What's up?

01:03.647 --> 01:05.489
Oh, my God.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.910
My mom was so right.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.238
Nice guys really do
eat the best pussy.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.618
I'm not really sure how to
interpret that. Thank you?

01:12.698 --> 01:13.870
Oh, my God.

01:13.949 --> 01:15.917
How are you so good at that?

01:15.993 --> 01:17.586
I'll let you in
on a trade secret.

01:17.661 --> 01:20.460
I actually write a short story
with my tongue every time I do it.

01:20.539 --> 01:22.541
It follows this young kid

01:22.624 --> 01:24.422
who finds this
alien in the woods

01:24.501 --> 01:26.344
with all these
Reese's Pieces and stuff.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.514
And he learns that
aliens are just no different.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.715
You just can
connect with anyone.

01:29.798 --> 01:33.974
It's kind of like E.
T., only with a lot more going down on chicks.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.144
Cool beans.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.267
Yeah, cool beans.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.189
Definitely. Cool little
frozen beans.

01:38.265 --> 01:39.357
Yeah.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.185
All right, so...

01:41.268 --> 01:43.236
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

01:43.312 --> 01:44.985
Yeah, we should, uh...

01:45.105 --> 01:47.107
We should probably...
Yeah, you should probably go.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.533
Switch places.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.031
What's that?

01:51.612 --> 01:53.205
I figured...
Don't you have to go?

01:53.280 --> 01:58.332
No, no, I just figured because
I made "mouth love" to you

01:58.410 --> 02:02.756
that maybe you could return the favor.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.295
What?

02:04.374 --> 02:06.047
Maybe toss a BJ my way.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.878
If you have time.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.714
Um, my stomach is
super-iffy right now.

02:10.797 --> 02:14.347
I think I got food poisoning.

02:14.426 --> 02:15.928
Baby.

02:16.511 --> 02:20.687
So I'm just in no condition
to blow you right now, Noah.

02:20.766 --> 02:22.689
No, yeah, that's cool.
Okay.

02:22.768 --> 02:25.612
Sorry. Next time, sweetie.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.236
Are you sure you don't
want to come over tonight?

02:28.315 --> 02:30.317
There's this thing called
a geomagnetic storm.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.495
It's really cool
and rare, actually.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.322
It's like
an astronomical explosion

02:35.405 --> 02:37.157
in the sky of all
these beautiful colors.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.084
Whoa!

02:39.159 --> 02:41.082
Kind of like
Mother Nature's fireworks.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.038
It happens, like, almost never.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.839
Like I said,
I'm just not feeling good.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.134
But thank you so much
for going down on me.

02:47.209 --> 02:51.555
Oh, yeah. You're really good
at, um, getting going down on,

02:51.630 --> 02:53.473
getting downed on,

02:53.548 --> 02:54.970
so you should be proud
of that as well.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.427
Okay, cool. You da man!

02:56.510 --> 02:57.853
You da man.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.351
Peace. You're
the best, sweetie.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.524
Don't stop believing in
yourself, okay, Maris?

03:04.768 --> 03:07.897
<i>Uncle Ricky, could you
read us a bedtime story?</i>

03:07.979 --> 03:09.856
<i>Please, huh, please?</i>

03:11.942 --> 03:14.195
<i>Here we go.</i>

03:14.277 --> 03:16.371
<i>Once upon a time, not long ago.</i>

03:16.446 --> 03:18.869
<i>Where people wore pajamas
and lived life slow.</i>

03:18.949 --> 03:21.168
<i>Where laws were stern
and justice stood.</i>

03:21.243 --> 03:23.416
<i>And people were behavin'
like they ought to good.</i>

03:23.495 --> 03:25.623
<i>There lived a little boy
who was misled.</i>

03:25.706 --> 03:28.084
<i>By another little boy
and this is what he said.</i>

03:28.166 --> 03:30.464
<i>Me and you Tike,
we're gonna make some cash.</i>

03:30.544 --> 03:32.888
<i>Robbin' old folks
and makin' the dash.</i>

03:32.963 --> 03:35.182
<i>They did the job,
money came with ease.</i>

03:35.257 --> 03:37.305
<i>But one couldn't stop,
it's like he had a disease.</i>

03:37.384 --> 03:39.853
<i>He robbed another and another
and a sister and a brother.</i>

03:39.928 --> 03:42.226
<i>Tried to rob a man
who was a D. T. undercover.</i>

03:42.305 --> 03:44.433
<i>The cop grabbed his arm,
he started actin' erratic.</i>

03:44.516 --> 03:46.860
<i>He said, "Keep still boy,
no need for static".</i>

03:46.977 --> 03:49.150
<i>Punched him in his belly
and gave him a slap.</i>

03:49.229 --> 03:51.527
<i>But little did he know,
the little boy was strapped.</i>

03:51.606 --> 03:54.075
<i>The kid pulled outta gun,
he said, "Why'd you hit me?".</i>

03:54.151 --> 03:56.245
<i>The barrel was set straight
for the cop's kidney.</i>

03:56.319 --> 03:58.663
<i>Ran up the stairs
up to the top floor.</i>

03:58.739 --> 04:00.867
<i>Opened up a door,
there guess who he saw.</i>

04:00.991 --> 04:03.085
<i>Dave, the dope fiend
shootin' dope.</i>

04:03.160 --> 04:05.413
<i>Who don't know the meaning
of water nor soap?</i>

04:05.495 --> 04:07.793
<i>He said, "I need bullets,
hurry up, run ".</i>

04:07.873 --> 04:10.171
<i>The dope fiend rolled back
a spankin' shot gun.</i>

04:10.250 --> 04:12.594
<i>This ain't funny,
so don't ya dare laugh.</i>

04:12.669 --> 04:14.922
<i>Just another case
about the wrong path.</i>

04:15.005 --> 04:17.678
<i>Straight and narrow
or your soul gets cast.</i>

04:18.175 --> 04:19.471
<i>Good night.</i>

04:25.223 --> 04:26.349
Yo, Mom, what's up?

04:26.433 --> 04:27.480
Noah!

04:27.559 --> 04:30.153
Where were you?
Were you out with that girl again?

04:30.228 --> 04:31.821
Yeah, but she's not
"that girl," okay?

04:31.897 --> 04:34.150
We're in a relationship.
It's legit.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.326
So have you started
looking for a job yet?

04:36.401 --> 04:38.995
I can't afford to have you
sitting around all day.

04:39.070 --> 04:43.951
You're in a period of stasis.
Just a stage of stasis.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.081
Sorry.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.788
<i>You sure you don't
want that beer now?</i>

04:47.871 --> 04:49.919
<i>Or maybe something stronger?
I have absinthe.</i>

04:50.040 --> 04:52.589
Why can't we hit up Dad?
He owes us 10 years of alimony.

04:52.709 --> 04:53.961
Oh, look, kiddo.

04:54.044 --> 04:57.218
If you're looking for a handout,
think again times 10.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.720
That guy's a diamond dealer.
He has crazy cash.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.393
Why'd you marry
such an A-hole?

05:02.052 --> 05:04.475
That A-hole gave me the
greatest gift in the world.

05:04.554 --> 05:05.726
Crabs?

05:06.389 --> 05:07.857
He gave me you.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.981
Okay.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.186
So, tell me, what do you think?

05:11.269 --> 05:12.737
Do I look okay?
You look amazing.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.690
Why are you so
concerned with your outfit?

05:14.773 --> 05:16.616
Mrs. Pedulla is introducing
me to a surgeon

05:16.733 --> 05:18.406
at the fundraiser at
the Historical Society.

05:18.485 --> 05:19.657
Okay.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.238
She thinks we're going
to hit it off. Nice.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.198
Well, don't give
it up too easily.

05:23.281 --> 05:24.658
Give what up?
What?

05:24.741 --> 05:26.618
Give what up?
What did...

05:26.743 --> 05:28.120
What the hell are
you talking about?

05:28.203 --> 05:29.204
I don't know.

05:29.287 --> 05:30.834
Have fun. I love you. Okay?
I love you.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.010
Hey, Mom.
Yeah.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.928
I think you're going to
have a really great night,

05:37.003 --> 05:39.005
and you look beautiful.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.091
Oh. From your lips
to God's ears.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.553
<i>Scientists are predicting a giant
storm over the city tonight.</i>

05:44.636 --> 05:46.855
<i>A geomagnetic storm, that is.</i>

05:46.930 --> 05:48.898
<i>Caused by ﬂare-ups on the
sun,</i>

05:48.974 --> 05:50.692
<i>this rare storm affects
the Earth's magnetic field...</i>

05:50.767 --> 05:53.020
Noah, can you get the phone?

05:53.103 --> 05:55.197
Mom, the phone's ringing!

05:55.272 --> 05:57.650
Noah, please get the phone!

05:57.774 --> 05:59.993
Mom, the phone's ringing!
Do you hear it?

06:00.110 --> 06:03.284
Noah, can't you think about somebody
else besides yourself for once?

06:03.363 --> 06:05.365
No, I totally was.
That's why I said the phone was ringing.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.700
I was letting you
know that it was ringing.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.911
Yeah. I'm thrilled
about tonight.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.923
<i>You flip, but they flop.
You flip, but they flop!</i>

06:12.998 --> 06:15.046
What? Oh, is that right?

06:15.125 --> 06:16.923
They perfected the pancake?

06:17.002 --> 06:18.219
A rain check?

06:18.295 --> 06:19.421
It's a perfect pancake!

06:19.504 --> 06:21.177
No, that's fine.
It's perfect.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.426
Mom, tell whoever's
on the phone

06:23.508 --> 06:24.634
that there's a perfect pancake.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.557
Thanks.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.268
I'm not going after all.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.940
What? Why?

06:31.016 --> 06:34.395
The Pedullas' sitter
canceled at the last minute.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.315
What?

06:39.649 --> 06:40.901
Do I have shit on my face?

06:40.984 --> 06:43.237
Come on. Don't tell me
you can't use the money.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.618
Are you crazy?
No. I'm not Mary Poppins.

06:45.697 --> 06:48.450
I'm not gonna be a babysitter.
I'm an adult man.

06:48.533 --> 06:51.252
Okay? Babysitting sucks.
Adult men don't babysit things.

06:51.328 --> 06:53.922
Oh, Noah, you're
wonderful with children!

06:55.665 --> 06:57.417
You know, never mind.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.175
Who am I kidding?
Finding a guy at my age is ridiculous.

07:01.755 --> 07:05.259
I'm going to change my dress.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.894
What are you in
the mood for? Chinese?

07:08.011 --> 07:09.809
Oh, come on.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.059
Ding-dong!

07:17.354 --> 07:18.526
Noah!

07:18.605 --> 07:19.697
Mrs. Pedulla.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.525
It's so good to see you!

07:21.608 --> 07:23.531
Oh, my gosh.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.659
Get over... Bring it in for a hug, babe.
What are we doing?

07:26.738 --> 07:30.459
God, I haven't see you since
you were, like, 15.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.537
Yeah. So Dr. Pedulla, he's still alive?
You two are still together?

07:33.703 --> 07:34.955
Um...

07:39.209 --> 07:40.882
Oh! That's my kind
of TV, right there.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.305
Yeah, well, feel free to
watch anything you want.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.597
Cool.
Yeah.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.091
Hey, Slater?

07:46.967 --> 07:50.642
Anyway, honey, this is Noah.
He's going to be babysitting tonight.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.476
What happened to Nancy?

07:52.555 --> 07:53.647
Honey, we talked about this.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.851
Nancy has a urinary
tract infection, okay?

07:55.934 --> 07:57.732
Is Clayton coming over tonight?

07:57.811 --> 08:00.405
No, Mom. His tarantula
died from parasites,

08:00.480 --> 08:01.823
and now he's in mourning.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.024
Well, you're in luck, Noah.

08:03.108 --> 08:05.327
The two of them
together are just trouble.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.075
Hey. That's not true.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.032
Why do you say that?
You're always attacking us!

08:10.115 --> 08:12.914
Honey, lam not attacking you.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.620
Okay? Calm down.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.623
You know what?
I'll be right back. Yeah.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.750
Okay? Excuse me
just one second.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.086
Hello?

08:23.086 --> 08:25.259
Hey, what are you watching?

08:25.338 --> 08:26.430
Just watching some gymnastics.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.553
Cool.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.634
Hey, how old are you, man?

08:29.759 --> 08:30.851
Thirteen.

08:30.927 --> 08:31.928
Thirteen?

08:32.011 --> 08:34.936
What am I doing here?
Why aren't you babysitting yourself?

08:35.015 --> 08:36.232
I'm not a babysitter, okay?

08:36.307 --> 08:37.479
Yeah, neither am I.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.897
If you would just
man up and babysit,

08:38.977 --> 08:41.196
I wouldn't have to be here tonight.
I could be out having fun.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.443
I have severe anxiety issues.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.609
And my doctor,
he says that I can't

08:46.693 --> 08:48.616
handle any kind
of responsibility,

08:48.695 --> 08:51.619
or else I could just snap

08:51.698 --> 08:53.041
at any moment.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.252
Jesus Christ, man. Relax.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.204
Okay. Sorry.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.256
Slater, nice to meet you.

09:00.331 --> 09:03.050
All right, should we go upstairs?
Bye, honey.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.303
We're gonna have
some fun tonight, pal.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.422
<i>Roll back nice and easy.</i>

09:07.505 --> 09:10.099
<i>Keep your breath inside
so you don't get wheezy.</i>

09:10.175 --> 09:12.598
Honey! What did Mommy tell you
about the mascara? Put it down.

09:12.677 --> 09:13.849
You said I
could play dress-up.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.054
Yeah, I said you
could play dress-up,

09:15.138 --> 09:16.230
not make yourself
look like a hooker.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.353
Look at you!

09:18.266 --> 09:20.610
My daughter
Blithe is going through

09:20.685 --> 09:22.983
this whole "celebutante" phase.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.906
It's kind of unfortunate,
but it's a fad.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.073
That's what they
do in the schools.

09:26.149 --> 09:27.992
It'll pass.I don't know
where they come from.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.069
Kids, right?

09:29.152 --> 09:30.153
Yeah, kids.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.863
Are you the babysitter?

09:31.946 --> 09:33.948
Why, in fact, I am.
I'm Noah.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.409
Noah. That's your name?

09:35.492 --> 09:36.539
Yeah.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.040
That's a super-hot name.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.120
What?

09:39.204 --> 09:42.128
Honey, it's not hot.
It's just his name.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.756
Mom, trust me.
It's a hot name.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.636
It's actually biblical.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.304
The Bible's a hot book.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.890
Sometimes I like
to get dressed up

09:50.965 --> 09:52.308
and wear my mom's makeup, Noah.

09:52.383 --> 09:53.851
That's cool.
I was thinking

09:53.927 --> 09:55.679
we could dress you up
like a princess.

09:56.554 --> 09:57.851
No, I don't think, uh...

09:57.931 --> 09:58.932
No, honey.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.608
- Maybe not tonight.
- Mom!

10:00.683 --> 10:01.935
Excuse me just one second.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.190
Yeah, see you in a sec.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.397
Hey, Noah. I have
a little surprise for you.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.572
Cool. Thanks. What is it?

10:08.483 --> 10:09.860
Do you like to smell pretty?

10:09.943 --> 10:11.570
Do I like to what?

10:11.653 --> 10:14.076
Oh, my God!
You got it right in my mouth!

10:14.155 --> 10:15.782
Why'd you do that?

10:15.865 --> 10:17.367
You just spit on my carpet!

10:17.450 --> 10:18.793
And you just sprayed perfume
in my mouth!

10:18.868 --> 10:19.915
What's your problem?

10:19.994 --> 10:23.624
My real babysitter, Nancy, she
plays with me when she babysits.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.879
She does what I want her
to do, Princess Noah!

10:25.959 --> 10:27.427
You know what?

10:27.502 --> 10:29.379
I'm gonna let
you in on a little secret.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.966
I'm not a real babysitter.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.016
Shocking.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.265
I'm more of a sit-on-the-couch,
eat-a-burrito,

10:36.344 --> 10:38.688
do-whatever-L say-or-I'll-Kill-you
type of babysitter.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.266
That's my style, blood.
You understand?

10:41.349 --> 10:43.022
Well, I want to
wear sparkly things,

10:43.101 --> 10:44.774
shiny things,
and glittery stuff

10:44.853 --> 10:47.527
to my favorite
hot nightclub, okay?

10:51.109 --> 10:52.326
Motherfuck!

10:52.402 --> 10:53.619
You guys okay in here?

10:53.695 --> 10:55.072
What's up? Yeah, no, yeah,

10:55.155 --> 10:57.704
I'm just hanging with this
little angel right here.

10:57.782 --> 10:58.999
Yeah, we're just chillin'.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.085
That's funny.
Your breath is really flowery.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.538
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.997
Yeah.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.297
Okay, should we go downstairs?

11:05.373 --> 11:06.590
Yeah, cool.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.386
<i>Tonight's main
event features crowd favorite.</i>

11:10.461 --> 11:13.510
<i>Ricky Fontaine
versus Dustin MacMillan.</i>

11:14.424 --> 11:15.846
Rodrigo!

11:15.925 --> 11:19.145
What did I tell you about
fireworks in the house?

11:19.220 --> 11:21.643
And can you shut off the
Kickboxing for one night, please?

11:21.723 --> 11:24.101
Say, um, hola to Noah.

11:26.728 --> 11:29.857
We just adopted him
from El Salvador last year

11:29.939 --> 11:32.488
and, you know, he's going
through some transitions.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.035
- Okay, cool.
- Okay, well,

11:34.110 --> 11:35.862
we'll see you later, all right?

11:36.279 --> 11:37.451
<i>Besos.</i>

11:37.947 --> 11:39.449
Sweet kid.
Yeah.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.079
He's a cutie pie.

11:50.084 --> 11:52.052
You kind of have to
watch out for Rodrigo.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.472
He has a habit of running away.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.844
Here, hold on to this.

11:55.924 --> 11:59.053
We sewed a GPS chip into his jacket
so we could keep track of him.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.388
It's kind of like
a LoJack for kids.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.769
Cool. It's just like
a little dot

12:03.848 --> 12:06.067
that follows him,
like a fugitive.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.315
Hey, honey, we're running late!
Let's go!

12:08.394 --> 12:09.441
So...

12:09.520 --> 12:10.567
In a minute.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.491
All of our information is
in here, under the blue tab.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.568
There's some frozen pizzas
and pudding in the fridge,

12:15.652 --> 12:17.575
and we'll be at the Historical
Society if you need us.

12:17.654 --> 12:18.997
Cool.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.074
Someone smells wonderful!

12:21.157 --> 12:23.831
I believe that's Noah's mouth.
You remember Noah.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.420
I understand you
were cited recently

12:25.495 --> 12:26.917
for driving
under the influence.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.670
Needless to say, our cars
are off-limits to you.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.343
Okay, no cars. Got it.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.420
We'll be back
no later than 1:00.

12:34.504 --> 12:37.098
Earlier's good for me,
too, so hurry home.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.096
And thank you!
Thank you, sweetheart.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.770
What the fuck am I doing here?

12:43.096 --> 12:45.349
<i>I come in peace.</i>

12:45.807 --> 12:48.686
<i>And you go in pieces, asshole.</i>

12:54.983 --> 12:56.200
What's up, little man?

12:59.862 --> 13:01.284
What'd you do that for?

13:01.614 --> 13:02.706
You clean it.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.079
You clean it.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.292
- Fucking weirdo.
- Hey, Noah!

13:08.371 --> 13:10.044
How's that perfume taste?

13:11.666 --> 13:14.044
Rodrigo, what is
your deal? Stop!

13:14.127 --> 13:16.880
Can we go to a club tonight?
This place is so dead.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.465
No.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.721
Don't you just want to
go dancing or something?

13:23.177 --> 13:25.475
Rodrigo, seriously,
what is your deal? Stop!

13:25.555 --> 13:28.729
I'm trying to watch TV with
JonBenet Ramsey over here.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.032
That's uncomfortable.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.279
Do you want to
hear some gossip?

13:37.358 --> 13:38.905
I got some hot gossip.

13:38.985 --> 13:39.986
I'm okay, actually.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.993
I'm trying to watch this, if
you could be quiet.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.415
Give it.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.869
I'm watching this, so can you
guys just be quiet, please?

13:47.952 --> 13:48.953
Thank you.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.835
I know
a secret nobody else knows.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.007
Oh, what's up, twins?
Ls Slater home?

13:57.086 --> 13:58.838
Is he here?
Yeah, oh, my God!

13:59.422 --> 14:00.594
Slater!

14:00.673 --> 14:03.392
You got the two redrum chicks from
<i>The Shining</i> here to see you!

14:04.552 --> 14:06.020
Slater's a cool guy.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.517
We go to school together.

14:07.597 --> 14:08.849
Oh, my God!

14:08.931 --> 14:10.183
Take care.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.859
Hi, Slater!

14:11.934 --> 14:13.857
Wendy Sapperstein is having
her Bat Mitzvah tonight,

14:13.936 --> 14:16.109
and she said it was okay if
some boys wanted to crash it.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.862
But we only want
the super-cute boys.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.567
I don't know if
I could make it tonight.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.698
My parents aren't home,

14:21.778 --> 14:23.746
and I'm not really
supposed to go anywhere.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.539
Well, if you want to come,
you can text us.

14:25.615 --> 14:26.662
Yeah, text us, definitely.

14:26.741 --> 14:27.708
Okay.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.331
I'll see you later, guys.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.912
Okay, cool!

14:32.121 --> 14:33.088
What's cooking,
good-looking?

14:33.164 --> 14:35.883
You know what?
I'm at a party.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.710
Party? I thought you
had food poisoning.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.046
<i>I did, and then
Steph called me,</i>

14:39.128 --> 14:40.300
<i>and she invited
me to this party.</i>

14:40.421 --> 14:41.638
<i>Do you want to come?</i>
Damn!

14:41.756 --> 14:43.133
I'm doing something
for my mom right now.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.640
I really,
really want to see you.

14:46.761 --> 14:50.231
<i>I'm actually, like,
super-horny for you,</i>

14:50.306 --> 14:52.900
and I was thinking
we could have sex.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.319
Like intercourse sex?

14:55.395 --> 15:00.447
Yeah, like full-on
vaginal sex.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.742
Yeah, I think I can work something out.
Yeah. For sure.

15:04.821 --> 15:05.868
<i>Awesome.</i>

15:05.947 --> 15:09.247
Listen, will you do me a favor and
pick up some coke on your way?

15:09.325 --> 15:13.000
Yeah, sure. Do you want anything
else, like beer, mixers?

15:13.079 --> 15:14.422
<i>No, I mean, like</i>

15:14.497 --> 15:15.919
coke!

15:15.998 --> 15:17.250
<i>You mean blow?</i>

15:17.333 --> 15:20.257
I thought you were done with that stuff.
That stuff's bad news.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.680
I am done with it.
It's not for me. It's for Steph,

15:22.755 --> 15:24.757
and it's her birthday.
She asked me for it.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.434
I'm just trying to be a
really good friend about it.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.352
I don't even know where I'd
get something like that.

15:28.469 --> 15:29.686
<i>Just call Karl.</i>

15:29.762 --> 15:30.854
<i>Who's Karl?</i>

15:30.930 --> 15:32.853
He's just a super-awesome guy
who sells me drugs.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.856
Used to sell me drugs.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.154
Noah...

15:39.689 --> 15:41.282
I only have 150 bucks.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.779
<i>That's more than enough.</i>

15:42.859 --> 15:44.702
<i>Just ask for one ticket,
and he'll hook it up.</i>

15:45.695 --> 15:49.450
<i>Leave me alone, asshole!
I'm on the phone with my boyfriend.</i>

15:49.740 --> 15:51.538
<i>Did you just call me
your boyfriend?</i>

15:51.617 --> 15:54.837
<i>Yeah, I guess I did.
So are you coming or not?</i>

15:56.539 --> 15:59.543
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

15:59.667 --> 16:02.887
Yeah. Fuck it. I'm in.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.977
Holy shit balls.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.474
A minivan.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.477
That car's not hot at all.

16:13.556 --> 16:14.978
As much as I hate to do this,

16:15.057 --> 16:16.400
we're going on
a little field trip.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.160
What is your deal?
Why are you wearing so much makeup?

16:30.239 --> 16:32.833
<i>Looking real fly
on my way to the club.</i>

16:32.909 --> 16:35.583
<i>Gonna dance all night
and get fucked up.</i>

16:35.661 --> 16:38.414
Say whatever you want.
I know I look good.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.670
All right, one of you guys
has to hop up here with me.

16:40.750 --> 16:41.842
I'm not your chauffeur.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.636
What if you hit
somebody or something?

16:43.753 --> 16:45.721
I mean, it's safer for children
to be in the back seat.

16:45.796 --> 16:47.924
You are such a bitch.
Grow a set of nuts.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.805
I beat him for you.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.511
Get his ass.
Guys.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.972
Not again.
Stop being such children.

16:54.055 --> 16:55.682
Hit him in the face, dawg!
Go away.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.483
Stop it.
One thing about Rodrigo.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.606
He's not a bitch,
I'll tell you that much.

17:21.332 --> 17:22.709
Slater, seriously,

17:22.791 --> 17:24.089
tell me you are not
wearing a fanny pack.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.887
Tell me I'm imagining that and
that's not what I'm actually seeing.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.306
I need it to carry my pills.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.975
Why do you take
those pills anyway?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.973
I already told you,
I have issues.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.178
Issues?

17:34.262 --> 17:35.855
You look like a Gap model!

17:35.930 --> 17:37.682
When I was your age,
I had a mouth full of braces

17:37.765 --> 17:39.733
and a face like
a Papa John's pizza.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.152
Those are real issues, my man.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.399
Whatever.

17:42.478 --> 17:45.402
I've got a good idea.
Why don't we go to a dance club?

17:45.481 --> 17:46.573
Why don't we play a game?

17:46.649 --> 17:47.821
Like Spin the Bottle?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.026
No, not like Spin the Bottle,

17:49.110 --> 17:51.738
like a little game I invented
called the Shut-the-Fuck-Up Game.

17:52.154 --> 17:55.249
First person not to shut the
fuck up loses. Ready? Go.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.791
Come on, Rodrigo,
you just lost, buddy.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.876
It was not me.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.129
Slater, that's disgusting.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.589
Didn't your parents teach
you not to fart in the car?

18:09.672 --> 18:10.844
You just crop-dusted me.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.140
No, that was not me.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.476
Uh-oh.
What's "uh-oh"?

18:14.552 --> 18:16.520
It was me. I pooted.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.224
I don't think it
was just a poot-poot.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.147
I sharted.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.569
Come on!

18:30.484 --> 18:34.159
<i>When you're shopping
It's super-cool.</i>

18:34.238 --> 18:36.582
Hey, Noah. Oh, my God,
isn't this shirt so cute?

18:36.657 --> 18:37.909
Oh, it's super-cute!

18:37.992 --> 18:39.209
Can you get it for me?

18:39.285 --> 18:41.287
Yeah! Of course.
I'll get you anything you want.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.542
Seriously?
No.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.215
Here, put these on.

18:44.290 --> 18:47.089
They're green.
I wouldn't be caught dead in these.

18:47.168 --> 18:48.420
Don't shit your
pants next time.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.721
Dressing room's over there.
Clean up, or whatever.

18:50.796 --> 18:51.922
Can I help you, sir?

18:52.006 --> 18:53.098
Huh?

18:53.174 --> 18:54.426
Can I help you?

18:54.508 --> 18:55.725
I'm just waiting for somebody.

18:55.843 --> 18:56.969
Yeah.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.220
Yup!

19:01.599 --> 19:03.397
No. I'm just waiting
for somebody.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.229
That's pretty weird, considering
you're a grown-ass man

19:06.312 --> 19:08.440
hanging out in the little
girls' underwear section.

19:08.522 --> 19:09.990
Right. I could see
how that could be

19:10.066 --> 19:11.568
misconstrued as strange,
or whatever.

19:11.651 --> 19:12.994
Very.
They fit. Let's go.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.241
There we go. There she is.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.743
Excuse me, young lady,
do you know this person?

19:16.822 --> 19:18.074
No.
Yeah.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.283
Which is it?

19:19.367 --> 19:22.086
He came into my house
and stole my mom's minivan.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.710
Now he's taking me and my
brothers to get some candy.

19:24.789 --> 19:28.293
Okay, that sounds way, way
worse than it actually is.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.003
Hey, don't I know
you from somewhere?

19:30.086 --> 19:32.589
What? No,
I'm the babysitter.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.515
What?
He's not a real babysitter.

19:34.590 --> 19:37.890
He's a "do-whatever-I-say-
or-I'll-kill-you type of babysitter."

19:37.968 --> 19:39.140
What?

19:39.220 --> 19:40.312
That sounds way...
That's what he said!

19:40.388 --> 19:41.856
Blithe, shut the fuck up.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.604
Do not tell her to shut up!

19:43.683 --> 19:44.980
Thank you.

19:45.059 --> 19:47.812
Ooh, shit! I remember you!
I went to high school with your ass!

19:47.895 --> 19:49.647
You came to my
house party one time,

19:49.772 --> 19:53.322
got all wasted, and then you
puked in my grandmama's urn.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.028
And when I asked
you about it, you lied

19:55.111 --> 19:56.704
and ran away like
a little biotch!

19:56.779 --> 19:58.122
I didn't run away
like a little biotch!

19:58.239 --> 19:59.582
I probably just ran
like a normal person.

19:59.657 --> 20:03.787
And now you're hanging out in the
little girls' clothes section.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.246
Can you please
lower your voice?

20:05.329 --> 20:06.706
There are numerous
misunderstandings.

20:06.789 --> 20:09.133
No, no, no. I'm not buying none of this.
Come on, little girl.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.127
Let me go!
I'm not buying it!

20:17.633 --> 20:19.727
You got some shit to deal with!

20:19.802 --> 20:22.601
Security!

20:24.557 --> 20:25.979
Why did you say that, Blithe?

20:26.225 --> 20:28.227
You were trying to make
me buy green underwear.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.903
Green underwear is not hot!

20:29.979 --> 20:31.481
You're the worst
babysitter ever!

20:31.564 --> 20:33.066
"You're
the worst babysitter ever!."

20:35.276 --> 20:36.323
You guys?

20:36.819 --> 20:38.036
Where's Rodrigo?

20:39.488 --> 20:41.161
I don't know.
I guess he left.

20:44.660 --> 20:48.085
That's an incredible observation, Slater.
Where did he go?

20:48.164 --> 20:50.166
I don't know.
I was talking to my friend Clayton.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.421
Which way did he go?

20:51.500 --> 20:52.592
I don't know!

20:56.672 --> 20:58.470
Got you, you little bastard.

21:02.511 --> 21:03.603
Hey, what's up?

21:03.679 --> 21:04.771
May I help you, sir?

21:04.847 --> 21:06.019
Yeah.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.768
I'm looking for
a small Hispanic boy.

21:08.851 --> 21:12.105
About 4'8", leather jacket,
pajamas, cowboy boots.

21:12.188 --> 21:13.781
Have you seen him?
No.

21:13.856 --> 21:15.358
"I've not seen
a 4'8" Hispanic boy

21:15.441 --> 21:17.785
in a leatherjacket, pajamas,
and cowboy boots.

21:17.860 --> 21:18.907
Probably would
have remembered that.

21:18.986 --> 21:22.616
Something tells me you have
before, you fucking asshole.

21:22.698 --> 21:29.047
<i>Don't say no because I insist.</i>

21:29.163 --> 21:35.591
<i>Somewhere, somehow
someone's got to be kissed.</i>

21:40.132 --> 21:41.930
There you are!
What are you doing in here?

21:42.009 --> 21:43.556
I dropped a bomb.

21:43.636 --> 21:44.888
That's very cute.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.639
Come on, wash your hands.

21:52.394 --> 21:53.441
What's so funny?

21:56.899 --> 21:57.900
Oh, shit!

21:58.025 --> 21:59.902
Oh, shit, what are you doing?

22:04.323 --> 22:05.666
What is going on back there?

22:05.741 --> 22:08.335
It's all good! Just continue
eating your meals. I know him.

22:08.410 --> 22:09.582
He's a friend of mine.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.748
That looks good.
What is that?

22:12.206 --> 22:14.004
You run away again,
and I'll break your legs!

22:14.083 --> 22:15.175
Then I bite your ear!

22:15.251 --> 22:17.253
What? I bite your what?
I eat your ear.

22:17.378 --> 22:19.847
I bite it off with my teeth,
then you don't hear nothing.

22:19.922 --> 22:21.424
That's very specific.

22:26.595 --> 22:29.769
All right. I've got to pick
up some candy for my girlfriend.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.226
So you guys wait here and watch

22:31.308 --> 22:32.651
little bin Laden
back there, okay?

22:32.726 --> 22:34.945
This isn't about
getting candy, is it?

22:35.020 --> 22:36.863
Lock the doors, keep your
head between your legs.

22:36.939 --> 22:39.863
Don't move or talk to
anybody or look at anybody.

22:41.277 --> 22:43.575
Don't you
fuck with me, Rodrigo.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.873
Hey, mister!
Hey, over here!

22:49.952 --> 22:53.047
I do top shit or bottom,
whatever you want.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.423
Noah Griffith?

22:58.502 --> 22:59.549
Yeah.

22:59.628 --> 23:00.880
Are you Karl?

23:02.298 --> 23:05.051
No, I fucking wish, <i>papi.</i>

23:05.134 --> 23:08.263
If you want to see Karl,
I'm gonna have to, like,

23:08.971 --> 23:11.144
strip-search you.

23:12.558 --> 23:15.812
Okay, we're good.
I believed you.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.819
Follow me!

23:18.939 --> 23:20.441
What the fuck?

23:20.524 --> 23:23.778
PLAYING)

23:25.446 --> 23:26.914
This way.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.241
Hey, Eduardo!

23:29.575 --> 23:31.577
He's really cranky.

23:54.016 --> 23:56.314
That's Russ.
He's got an attitude.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.695
You're such a slowpoke.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.207
Come on.

24:35.099 --> 24:38.444
It's okay. Do it again.
Do it again.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.401
One more time.

24:42.064 --> 24:44.192
That's good. I like that.

24:51.824 --> 24:52.996
Hey, Karl!

24:53.075 --> 24:54.167
Oh, my God! You scared me!

24:54.243 --> 24:56.587
You scared me, sneaking up on
me like a little squirrel!

24:56.704 --> 24:58.172
You have a visitor.

24:58.247 --> 24:59.669
Dude, the roller skates.

24:59.748 --> 25:02.046
You're going to get track marks
all over my mahogany floors.

25:02.126 --> 25:03.173
Are you serious?

25:03.252 --> 25:05.550
Go get me a smoothie.
Get out of my face.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.631
- You're no fun.
- You're no fun.

25:07.756 --> 25:10.350
Oh, my God. Hi. Hi.

25:10.426 --> 25:13.851
You must be Noah Griffith.
I've been waiting for you all night.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.852
What's up?
I'm Karl with a.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.023
Sorry about the banging.

25:17.099 --> 25:18.692
We're doing some slight renovations,
as you can see.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.064
We're knocking down some walls

25:20.144 --> 25:21.396
so we can get a little more
square footage in here.

25:21.478 --> 25:22.980
A little more elbow room.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.360
Uh, that's awesome.

25:24.440 --> 25:25.657
What's awesome about it?

25:25.774 --> 25:27.151
Huh?

25:27.234 --> 25:28.781
Why is that awesome?

25:30.279 --> 25:34.580
More room for bodybuilders
and experiments and stuff.

25:37.161 --> 25:39.255
That's funny!
You're funny, Noah Griffith.

25:39.329 --> 25:40.751
You're really funny.

25:40.831 --> 25:44.176
Thank you.
You're very cool as well. So...

25:44.293 --> 25:46.261
You sure we haven't met?

25:47.755 --> 25:49.598
Déjà vu.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.926
Hey, check this out.

25:52.009 --> 25:53.556
This is an art project.

25:53.635 --> 25:56.980
It's made from the shell of
an ancient baby dinosaur egg.

25:57.097 --> 25:59.725
We like to package our
product artistically.

25:59.808 --> 26:02.607
And prehistorically. Bump?

26:03.645 --> 26:05.318
I'm fine, thanks.

26:07.483 --> 26:11.078
I like you, Noah Griffith!
You're so shy.

26:11.153 --> 26:13.747
You're so gorgeous and shy.
You remind me of my Aunt Shirley.

26:13.822 --> 26:15.950
She was Asian.
Are you biracial?

26:16.492 --> 26:18.620
Karl! I got shot!

26:18.702 --> 26:19.828
Oh, my God.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.004
I got shot, Karl.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.127
Oh, my God.

26:22.206 --> 26:24.083
Don't let me die
on this floor, Karl.

26:24.166 --> 26:25.509
Who shot at you?

26:25.584 --> 26:28.963
Angelo on 14th Street
shot me in my tummy, Karl.

26:29.046 --> 26:30.514
He shot me in my tummy.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.886
Oh, my God.

26:31.965 --> 26:35.014
Please, someone, please!
Somebody get me a doctor!

26:35.344 --> 26:37.972
Please, someone...
Do you know CPR?

26:38.055 --> 26:39.102
What? I don't know.

26:39.181 --> 26:40.558
Do you know CPR?

26:40.641 --> 26:42.018
I don't even
think mouth-to-mouth

26:42.101 --> 26:43.444
will help this
particular situation.

26:43.519 --> 26:44.862
Why doesn't Garv do it?

26:47.147 --> 26:48.774
Karl, don't let me die!

26:48.857 --> 26:49.949
I have kids, man.

26:50.025 --> 26:52.653
My God. Jesus Christ.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.864
Fucking hell!

26:54.947 --> 26:56.574
Somebody help me.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.250
Fine! What?

26:59.326 --> 27:00.327
Help me, please.

27:00.410 --> 27:01.627
He's going into shock.

27:01.703 --> 27:03.125
Please, help me.
Oh, God.

27:03.539 --> 27:05.007
Now, please, hurry up.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.167
What's up, fool?

27:07.835 --> 27:08.836
Got you!

27:08.919 --> 27:10.296
What's happening right now?

27:10.379 --> 27:12.598
I don't understand. Are you okay?
What, is this a joke?

27:13.715 --> 27:15.513
I got him! I got him!

27:15.592 --> 27:18.345
I could smell your breath that time.
You were so close.

27:18.428 --> 27:19.725
What's happening?

27:19.805 --> 27:21.057
You're so adorable.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.687
You just fell
for a little prank.

27:22.766 --> 27:23.892
Prank?

27:23.976 --> 27:25.023
Around here,
we pull pranks and shit

27:25.102 --> 27:27.104
to make sure people
aren't undercover pigs

27:27.187 --> 27:28.484
'cause we kill
pigs around here.

27:28.564 --> 27:30.407
This is Julio,
my business partner.

27:31.525 --> 27:32.651
This is Kool-Aid, man.

27:33.068 --> 27:35.070
Come on over here.
Let's get down to business.

27:37.281 --> 27:38.828
Right there,
there are prostitutes

27:38.907 --> 27:40.329
and there are people with guns.

27:40.409 --> 27:42.457
And I don't want
to get shot tonight.

27:42.578 --> 27:45.878
<i>She ain't nothin' but a hoochie
mama Hoodrat, hoodrat hoochie mama.</i>

27:45.956 --> 27:47.833
<i>Oh, I love those big brown eyes.</i>

27:47.916 --> 27:49.668
<i>And the way you
shake your thighs.</i>

27:49.751 --> 27:51.549
<i>Acting like you're so damn cute.</i>

27:51.628 --> 27:53.380
<i>Just let your boy
just slide them boots.</i>

27:54.464 --> 27:56.091
- You got my money?
- Yeah.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.843
- Yeah!
- Put out your hand.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.557
Here's one ticket.

27:59.636 --> 28:01.730
Trick or treat, smell my feet.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.227
How do you know Marisa?

28:03.307 --> 28:04.684
You know Marisa?

28:05.392 --> 28:07.360
She is my girlfriend, actually.

28:11.148 --> 28:12.616
Come on, man, stop it!

28:13.442 --> 28:15.365
Karl.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.287
There's some kid here.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.456
You didn't call
the fuzz, did you, Noah?

28:19.531 --> 28:21.033
No. Rodrigo.

28:21.783 --> 28:24.787
What are you doing? Go back to the car.
How'd you even get in here?

28:24.870 --> 28:26.463
I pee-pee now.

28:27.331 --> 28:28.628
He's with you?

28:28.707 --> 28:29.924
Yeah, I'm, uh babysitting.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.047
Babysitting?

28:31.126 --> 28:32.753
You need to go back to the car,

28:32.836 --> 28:34.383
because you already
went pee-pee. Okay?

28:34.463 --> 28:36.306
I pee-pee.
Pee your pants.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.224
What's your problem, man?
Let him take a piss!

28:38.300 --> 28:39.893
Trying to make a little kid
hold in his pee-pee!

28:39.968 --> 28:41.686
That's right. <i>Oye,</i> Fonzie.

28:44.306 --> 28:45.558
You go pee-pee.

28:45.641 --> 28:46.767
Don't make a mess!

28:46.850 --> 28:48.147
Come in for a bear hug.

28:49.645 --> 28:51.192
Get outta here.
Put that handshake away.

28:51.271 --> 28:53.148
Better hug this motherfucker if
you know what's good for you.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.654
Hug him tight!

28:56.360 --> 28:57.987
Swordfight up in this motherfucker!
Pull it together!

28:59.154 --> 29:00.997
Have a great night.

29:01.657 --> 29:04.706
Okay, I know we had a few
setbacks, but we're almost done.

29:04.785 --> 29:06.833
I just gotta drop off this
package to my girlfriend,

29:06.912 --> 29:08.505
say a quick hi-ho to her,

29:08.580 --> 29:10.423
then I'm going to turn us
around and take us home.

29:10.666 --> 29:11.918
I know I can be a bit
of a prick sometimes,

29:12.000 --> 29:13.798
so I want to thank you guys
for being patient.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.254
Okay, so we're gonna go

29:15.337 --> 29:16.634
to my favorite
club in New York City,

29:16.713 --> 29:17.805
and you're gonna come...

29:17.881 --> 29:18.882
Hey, buddy, what you got there?

29:18.966 --> 29:19.933
I no know.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.260
I find it in bathroom.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.016
Shit!

29:26.598 --> 29:29.442
Rodrigo,
give that to me right now.

29:29.518 --> 29:31.191
I'm serious, man.
Give it to me right now.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.647
No way. Finder keepers.

29:32.729 --> 29:35.027
Put it in my hand right now!

29:35.107 --> 29:36.154
No.

29:36.233 --> 29:37.485
Rodrigo.
No.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.410
Just... Just let go!

29:39.528 --> 29:41.121
It's mine.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.743
Let it go!
Just give it to me!

29:42.864 --> 29:45.367
You're both such booger faces.
Stop fighting!

29:46.201 --> 29:47.544
Let go!
Okay.

29:49.871 --> 29:51.214
It's snowing!

29:55.043 --> 29:57.671
What the fuck?

30:11.059 --> 30:12.481
Hello?
<i>Noah Griffith!</i>

30:12.561 --> 30:14.029
Hey!

30:14.104 --> 30:16.607
Hey, Karl, what's up?
How did you get this number?

30:16.690 --> 30:18.408
I got it off
your Facebook page,

30:18.483 --> 30:21.111
as I was trying to friend you
as you were walking out.

30:21.194 --> 30:24.414
Anyway, as I was friending
you, Julio noticed that

30:24.489 --> 30:26.867
maybe you stole a baby
dinosaur egg from me.

30:26.950 --> 30:29.078
And it's just,
like, I'm confused.

30:29.161 --> 30:32.131
You know what I mean?
Because I'm thinking that we're friends,

30:32.205 --> 30:35.835
and then all of a sudden,
I don't know, it's like...

30:36.585 --> 30:38.713
I really liked you, you know?

30:38.795 --> 30:42.390
Karl, just relax, please.
I'm sorry, I don't have your drugs.

30:42.466 --> 30:44.468
<i>The kid I'm babysitting,
he took one of your eggs,</i>

30:44.593 --> 30:45.765
<i>and I was trying to get it back</i>

30:45.844 --> 30:47.061
<i>and it accidentally
splashed in my face.</i>

30:47.137 --> 30:48.980
<i>Fucking shut the fuck up.</i>

30:49.097 --> 30:50.440
<i>Unless I get my drugs back</i>

30:50.515 --> 30:54.110
<i>or my money back,
I'm going to kill you!</i>

30:54.186 --> 30:55.859
<i>I'll fucking kill you!</i>

30:55.937 --> 30:57.814
<i>I want you to meet me
at Wing's Fish Market.</i>

30:57.898 --> 30:58.899
Where?

30:58.982 --> 31:01.326
Wing's Fish Market.
It's in Chinese Town.

31:01.610 --> 31:05.535
<i>You meet me there in one hour with
my 10 grand, or you're dead meat.</i>

31:05.614 --> 31:07.708
Um, okay. Thanks, bye.

31:08.825 --> 31:10.293
I have to go pee-pee now.

31:11.578 --> 31:14.001
You're holding it in
this time, asshole.

31:24.424 --> 31:26.176
It'll be all right.

31:26.259 --> 31:28.353
I thought he was my friend.

31:33.683 --> 31:35.276
It's all right.

31:40.107 --> 31:41.700
Shut up!
I wanna go home.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.911
I don't
know what you're saying.

31:43.985 --> 31:45.407
Don't. Stop it!
Stop! No!

31:45.487 --> 31:46.909
No, my lip gloss!
Give it back!

31:46.988 --> 31:49.912
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!

31:49.991 --> 31:51.243
What are you
getting mad at us for?

31:51.326 --> 31:54.580
Because Rodrigo here is a thief,
and now I'm in deep shit.

31:54.663 --> 31:56.461
And the worst
part of all of this

31:56.540 --> 31:58.292
is that I'm stuck
here with you three.

31:58.375 --> 32:01.174
You, you got more issues
than a magazine stand.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.301
And, you, wipe the makeup
off your face, Picasso.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.428
What are you, a mob wife?

32:05.507 --> 32:07.680
And, you, you're the worst.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.432
I know you're a little kid,
and I know I'm not

32:09.511 --> 32:11.184
supposed to say this
kind of stuff to you,

32:11.680 --> 32:13.523
but fuck you.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.316
Fuck you so much.

32:15.392 --> 32:16.609
You're a douche.

32:16.685 --> 32:18.437
Look, Noah,
if you hate us that much,

32:18.520 --> 32:20.272
then just drop us
off with our parents.

32:20.355 --> 32:24.030
You know what?
That's an amazing idea. Let's go.

32:36.288 --> 32:39.132
<i>I've seen the way
you look at me.</i>

32:40.333 --> 32:44.258
<i>I know the things you say
when I'm not there.</i>

32:46.840 --> 32:49.969
<i>But when you're here
alone with me.</i>

32:51.386 --> 32:54.560
<i>Baby, don't pretend
that you don't care.</i>

32:54.639 --> 32:59.315
<i>Come on, let the feeling begin.</i>

32:59.394 --> 33:02.944
<i>Come on, baby Come on, yeah.</i>

33:05.275 --> 33:09.280
<i>Don't stop
when the feeling begins.</i>

33:11.072 --> 33:15.202
Come on. I've changed my mind.
I need to clean up my mess myself.

33:16.703 --> 33:20.378
All right, ideas,
ideas, ideas, ideas, ideas.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.460
Okay. Slater,
can you get off the phone?

33:23.543 --> 33:25.341
I need an idea. You can text
your buddy Clayton later, okay?

33:25.420 --> 33:26.922
Yeah, man, seriously!

33:27.005 --> 33:29.007
It's not Clayton.
It's those twins,

33:29.090 --> 33:30.842
and they want me to
go to Prospect Hall

33:30.926 --> 33:32.644
for Wendy Sapperstein's
Bat Mitzvah.

33:32.719 --> 33:35.222
That's, like, a pretty
swanky joint, right?

33:35.305 --> 33:37.524
Yeah, the Sappersteins
are totally loaded

33:37.599 --> 33:39.772
and she's, like, crazy spoiled.

33:39.851 --> 33:40.898
Spoiled.

33:42.229 --> 33:44.197
So lots of gifts, lots of cash.

33:45.273 --> 33:48.277
Slater, you're a genius.
You're a genius, dude!

33:51.905 --> 33:54.249
All right, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

33:54.324 --> 33:56.622
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Hustle!

33:57.702 --> 34:00.296
All right, come on, kids.
Come on.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.215
All right, thank you.

34:02.290 --> 34:03.883
This place looks like a party.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.461
Keep walking, keep walking.

34:06.628 --> 34:08.801
Maybe you should
just invite anyone you know,

34:08.880 --> 34:11.007
anyone who's ugly, because
they seem to all be here!

34:11.675 --> 34:12.972
That's very nice.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.303
Is that what
the rabbis taught you?

34:14.386 --> 34:17.139
Mom! This is my night.
It's my celebration,

34:17.222 --> 34:19.725
and I did not invite these
nerds to my Bat Mitzvah!

34:19.808 --> 34:23.108
What more can I do for you?
Rent the Taj Ma-fucking-hal for you?

34:23.186 --> 34:26.985
There's so much blue cheese
here, it smells like barf, Mom!

34:27.065 --> 34:30.069
Damn, Wendy Sapperstein's
a big ol' bitch!

34:30.150 --> 34:31.447
Yeah, she scares me.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.405
All right, guys, we're gonna
stay under the radar.

34:33.487 --> 34:34.989
Okay? Keep it low profile.

34:36.324 --> 34:37.416
Did you hear what I just said?

34:37.492 --> 34:39.210
I said low profile!
All right?

34:40.120 --> 34:43.293
Stop puncturing balloons!
Do you understand me?

34:44.123 --> 34:46.752
Noah, Noah. Does this place
have bottle service?

34:46.835 --> 34:48.212
I want a Red Bull and vodka.

34:48.295 --> 34:49.512
No, you don't.
You don't even know

34:49.588 --> 34:50.760
what that is.
It's bad for you.

34:50.839 --> 34:52.681
Slater! You showed up!

34:52.757 --> 34:54.554
We've been looking
all over for you!

34:54.634 --> 34:55.806
Oh. Hey.

34:55.885 --> 34:57.011
We've been dancing all night.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.688
Yeah, this Bat
Mitzvah is the best!

34:58.763 --> 35:01.266
It's like Jew city out there,
and we're the fucking mayors.

35:01.349 --> 35:02.396
You ready to go dance?

35:02.475 --> 35:05.775
He's ready to go dance.
This guy was born to dance.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.106
You want to come?
Come on. Let's go.

35:07.188 --> 35:08.155
You big stud.

35:08.231 --> 35:10.279
Time to go make
a Slater sandwich!

35:10.358 --> 35:12.406
Some of that gingerbread,
my man.

35:13.862 --> 35:16.706
No bathrooms, you understand me, Rodrigo?
No <i>baño.</i>

35:18.950 --> 35:20.793
You're a <i>pendejo.</i>
You're a <i>puto.</i>

35:20.869 --> 35:22.291
You're a <i>puta</i>, bitch.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.713
I'm gonna fuck you up, dawg!

35:42.849 --> 35:44.146
Noah Griffith?

35:44.225 --> 35:45.477
Uh, hey.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.686
That's you, right?

35:46.770 --> 35:48.238
Yeah. What's up?
How's it going?

35:48.313 --> 35:49.485
It's Roxanne.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.942
I lived in the dorms down the
hall from you, freshman year.

35:52.025 --> 35:53.743
That's right.
We were in Astronomy, right?

35:53.818 --> 35:55.286
Yeah, I sat behind
you in Astronomy.

35:55.362 --> 35:57.581
We were, like, the only two
students who seemed to give a shit.

35:57.697 --> 35:58.823
That's right. Yeah.

35:58.907 --> 36:01.831
You made that scale model of
Saturn with a cantaloupe, right?

36:01.910 --> 36:03.662
Oh, shit, yeah.
That was you.

36:03.745 --> 36:05.418
That thing was fresh.
That was cool. Yeah, that was me.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.750
Did you know about the
geomagnetic storm tonight?

36:07.874 --> 36:09.717
I did. I'm gonna
check it out. Are you?

36:09.793 --> 36:10.965
I'm actually kind
of excited for it.

36:11.044 --> 36:12.259
Yeah. For sure.

36:12.260 --> 36:14.096
Yeah, it's gonna be cool.
Yeah, it's gonna be pretty cool.

36:14.214 --> 36:17.093
Stay on that dance floor!
It's time for the hora!

36:17.175 --> 36:18.597
Wow!

36:18.718 --> 36:21.267
<i>Hava Nagila</i>, yeah.
You gonna go on the chair?

36:21.388 --> 36:22.856
I don't think so.
Yeah?

36:22.931 --> 36:24.353
No. No chair for me.

36:24.432 --> 36:27.106
I can't believe you're here.
Like, I haven't seen you in forever.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.859
Yeah, I'm actually
not in school this year.

36:29.938 --> 36:31.110
That sucks.

36:31.231 --> 36:34.531
But I'm working
right now, obviously.

36:34.609 --> 36:35.826
But once I get off work,

36:35.902 --> 36:37.825
I'm going to a pool hall
with some of my co-workers.

36:37.904 --> 36:39.531
Would you want to come?
Oh, cool.

36:39.614 --> 36:42.208
That would be great,
but I'm actually

36:42.283 --> 36:44.877
in the middle of
a situation currently.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.705
Oh, yeah. No worries.
I just thought I'd ask.

36:46.788 --> 36:48.415
No. Thank you.
Any other time.

36:49.958 --> 36:50.959
Oh, my God.

36:53.878 --> 36:55.300
Oh, shit.

36:55.422 --> 36:56.924
It was great
running into you again.

36:57.006 --> 36:58.223
Oh, my God!

36:59.467 --> 37:01.140
Put your fucking dick away!

37:01.261 --> 37:03.138
You're getting
piss all over me!

37:03.221 --> 37:05.474
You're getting
piss all over my feet!

37:05.598 --> 37:07.100
Watch out. Come on.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.569
- Happy birthday, Wendy!
- Mazel <i>tov,</i> Wendy.

37:09.644 --> 37:11.146
What were you doing?

37:11.229 --> 37:13.948
You do not take a piss in the
middle of a party, okay?

37:14.816 --> 37:16.489
You don't piss in the middle
of a Bat Mitzvah, you idiot!

37:16.568 --> 37:17.911
Clayton?

37:17.986 --> 37:19.488
Oh, shit.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.324
What are you doing here?
What about your tarantula?

37:22.407 --> 37:23.829
Oh, I got over that, man.

37:23.908 --> 37:25.251
It's just a spider, bro.

37:25.326 --> 37:27.749
Since when do you hang out
with Benji Gillespie?

37:27.829 --> 37:29.923
Look, I can hang out with as
many other people as I want.

37:29.998 --> 37:31.420
I don't think you
understand that.

37:31.499 --> 37:33.342
I'm getting kind of sick of going
to your house all the time

37:33.418 --> 37:34.840
and watching tennis.

37:34.961 --> 37:36.258
We do other shit.

37:36.337 --> 37:38.840
No, we don't!
You don't do anything!

37:38.965 --> 37:41.093
I can't just
always hang around you.

37:41.176 --> 37:44.020
I don't get why
you're being mean to me.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.768
He doesn't want to hang out
with you any more, bro.

37:45.847 --> 37:47.099
How hard is it to
understand that?

37:47.182 --> 37:51.028
Just stop calling and texting
him all the time. It's weird.

37:53.521 --> 37:54.989
Is that true?

37:55.648 --> 37:57.150
See you around.

37:58.651 --> 37:59.948
Yo.

38:01.029 --> 38:02.076
Hey, man. You all right?

38:02.155 --> 38:03.452
Those guys fucking with you?
Yeah, I'm fine.

38:03.531 --> 38:04.623
You okay?

38:04.699 --> 38:05.746
Yeah, just leave me alone!

38:08.161 --> 38:11.256
Hi. I'm so sorry to
have to say this to you.

38:11.331 --> 38:14.961
It's just that I can't
seem to find your car.

38:15.835 --> 38:17.758
What do you mean,
you can't find my car?

38:18.046 --> 38:20.970
Well, I think we lost it.

38:21.049 --> 38:23.643
You didn't lose your Morrissey box set.
Where's my fucking car, dude?

38:24.886 --> 38:26.763
Did you lose it or you
taking a shit right now?

38:27.055 --> 38:28.102
A little of both.

38:28.181 --> 38:29.478
There's no "a little
bit" of taking a shit.

38:29.557 --> 38:31.025
You're either shitting
your pants or you're not.

38:32.852 --> 38:35.651
Stop crying, all right?
It's not going to solve anything.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.403
Let's go find this shit.
All right?

38:39.108 --> 38:40.155
Hey, look! There it is!

38:40.235 --> 38:42.704
Oh, thank God we found it.

38:42.779 --> 38:45.783
That's not finding it, you idiot.
Someone stole it.

38:46.241 --> 38:47.618
Oh, poo.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.130
Three thousand bucks.

38:57.210 --> 38:58.712
Is that good?

38:59.504 --> 39:03.554
No. It's not. We need 7,000 more.
And it's almost 11:00.

39:03.633 --> 39:05.306
Hey, Noah, I have an idea.

39:05.385 --> 39:07.012
How about you start your own
signature fragrance?

39:07.095 --> 39:08.312
That's a great idea!

39:08.388 --> 39:09.731
I'll just alert
my team of scientists,

39:09.806 --> 39:11.149
have them invent a new perfume.

39:11.224 --> 39:12.817
We'll start
selling it and we'll have

39:12.892 --> 39:14.394
seven grand in
the next 45 minutes!

39:14.477 --> 39:16.070
You're such a jerk.

39:16.145 --> 39:17.692
God damn it, my fucking shin.

39:17.772 --> 39:19.194
I'm just trying to help.

39:19.274 --> 39:21.447
All I know is, is I'm going
to be a famous celebrity

39:21.526 --> 39:23.699
who designs on the side,
and I'm going to be rich.

39:23.778 --> 39:25.200
What the hell are
you talking about?

39:25.280 --> 39:26.907
You do know that just
being a celebrity and

39:26.990 --> 39:29.209
having a good time is
not a real job, right?

39:29.284 --> 39:31.036
Yeah, it is!
Being a famous celebrity

39:31.119 --> 39:32.496
is the greatest
thing in the world!

39:32.579 --> 39:34.081
It means people
take your picture.

39:34.163 --> 39:35.710
You get to have
birthday parties at

39:35.790 --> 39:37.258
the coolest clubs
and dance on tables.

39:37.333 --> 39:40.928
Even for a small child,
you sound like an idiot.

39:42.255 --> 39:43.973
What are you walking away for?

39:44.048 --> 39:45.891
What's your problem,
drama queen?

39:45.967 --> 39:48.641
My problem is that
my best friend Clayton

39:48.720 --> 39:50.347
doesn't want to hang out
with me any more

39:50.430 --> 39:52.023
because he
doesn't like me back,

39:52.098 --> 39:55.978
and he'd rather hang out with an
asshole named Benji Gillespie.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.562
That is my problem!

39:57.645 --> 39:59.773
Okay, well...

39:59.856 --> 40:00.857
You'll make another friend.

40:00.940 --> 40:01.941
No.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.619
No, I won't.

40:04.694 --> 40:06.742
Well, I don't know the inner
workings of your friendship,

40:06.821 --> 40:09.324
but if he doesn't
like you, then screw him.

40:12.827 --> 40:14.374
All right, train's coming!

40:14.454 --> 40:16.001
Let's go!

40:20.960 --> 40:26.262
<i>If you only knew
what it was like.</i>

40:26.341 --> 40:31.598
<i>Hoping that you see the light.</i>

40:31.679 --> 40:36.310
<i>And you always put up a fight.</i>

40:36.851 --> 40:40.401
<i>I get lost within your stare.</i>

40:43.358 --> 40:46.953
<i>When we breathe the same air.</i>

40:48.029 --> 40:51.624
<i>I see you everywhere.</i>

40:59.165 --> 41:03.716
<i>Oh, if you only knew.</i>

41:04.587 --> 41:06.009
Whoa.

41:08.758 --> 41:10.385
It's like actual China.

41:11.886 --> 41:14.309
Excuse me.
Is this Wing's Fish Market?

41:14.389 --> 41:17.438
You must be Noah Griffith.
Mr. Karl is expecting you.

41:19.352 --> 41:20.444
Wait here, all right?

41:20.520 --> 41:21.567
So.

41:22.105 --> 41:23.778
- Did you get my money?
- Um...

41:24.816 --> 41:26.944
Garv, can I get some
chili flakes, please?

41:27.402 --> 41:28.949
Garv, honey.

41:29.028 --> 41:30.780
Look at me. Look at me!

41:30.863 --> 41:32.831
Uh, yes,
I have money right here.

41:32.907 --> 41:34.909
Garv? Oh, boy.
Here you go. I got it.

41:34.993 --> 41:36.461
Not listening.
He's got the headphones on.

41:36.536 --> 41:38.959
I got the cash right here for you.
Here you go.

41:39.539 --> 41:41.712
So how do you guys
all know each other?

41:41.791 --> 41:43.543
What the fuck
difference does it make?

41:43.626 --> 41:45.048
We got a problem.
What's the problem?

41:45.128 --> 41:47.222
My man! You got $3,000 here.

41:47.296 --> 41:50.175
You are short $7,000!

41:50.258 --> 41:51.350
Short?

41:51.426 --> 41:53.349
Okay, I have checks.

41:53.428 --> 41:54.725
Are you kidding me?
Checks, yes.

41:54.804 --> 41:56.556
Checks! What's the matter
with you?

41:56.973 --> 41:58.816
Who the fuck is
Wendy Sapperstein?

41:58.891 --> 42:01.064
The Sappersteins are loaded,

42:01.144 --> 42:02.521
so they're not gonna
miss the money at all.

42:02.603 --> 42:05.777
Garv! Please, chili flakes!
You don't listen!

42:05.857 --> 42:07.530
So you can sign
the check over to yourself.

42:07.608 --> 42:08.860
I'll count to three.

42:08.943 --> 42:10.320
One.
Sign the checks over?

42:10.403 --> 42:11.825
Two. Yeah, sign the
checks over to yourself.

42:11.904 --> 42:13.372
Three. Good night.

42:16.117 --> 42:17.164
Did you hear that?

42:17.243 --> 42:18.210
Why'd you do that?

42:18.286 --> 42:20.038
Drop him off at the podiatrist.

42:20.121 --> 42:22.465
Make his mom a mix CD
with an apology letter.

42:23.624 --> 42:26.252
I told you, dawg.
Now your foot match your asshole.

42:30.506 --> 42:32.053
Hey!
<i>Hey, Karl!</i>

42:32.133 --> 42:33.350
Hey, Marisa.

42:33.426 --> 42:35.099
Where you at?
I'm at a party!

42:35.178 --> 42:36.725
A party?
What?

42:36.804 --> 42:38.772
I'm always down to party.

42:38.848 --> 42:41.522
All right, text me the address.
All right, baby.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.562
We're gonna meet you at
this party at midnight.

42:43.644 --> 42:44.896
If you don't
have my seven grand,

42:44.979 --> 42:48.358
Julio's gonna tickle your
girlfriend's asshole with a feather.

42:49.317 --> 42:50.739
How'd you get that name
"The Feather" again?

42:50.818 --> 42:54.163
Let me tell the story, man.
My joint got a little curve to it.

42:54.238 --> 42:56.661
So I go up in there, and it
tickles the lady's asshole.

42:56.741 --> 42:58.584
Tickle, tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle.

42:58.659 --> 43:01.082
My joint goes in and comes
out at the same time

43:01.162 --> 43:02.459
you know what I'm saying?
Tickle, tickle.

43:02.538 --> 43:03.835
Tickle, tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle. Yeah.

43:05.792 --> 43:08.796
See, when I'm stoking,
I see the head,

43:08.878 --> 43:11.848
although I'm in it,
my head is popping out.

43:11.923 --> 43:13.675
Still, like that.
Like a U-turn.

43:13.758 --> 43:16.432
My joint make
a U-turn in that ass.

43:16.511 --> 43:20.186
The Feather is in
effect since 1981, son.

43:22.141 --> 43:24.235
My joint be
pop-locking in that ass.

43:24.310 --> 43:26.278
It go in your ass and come
out your ass, like that.

43:26.354 --> 43:27.446
See what I'm saying?

43:27.522 --> 43:29.490
Come here. Give me a hug.

43:29.565 --> 43:31.112
Give him <i>a</i> fucking hug!
Don't be shy.

43:31.192 --> 43:33.035
You're so shy. Come here.

43:33.444 --> 43:34.570
Hug me tight.

43:34.654 --> 43:36.952
It's okay.
It's our little secret.

43:37.031 --> 43:39.033
But I want you to
think about something.

43:39.158 --> 43:42.458
Garv was my third
best friend in the world,

43:42.537 --> 43:46.292
and I shot him in the feet
for being a bad listener.

43:46.374 --> 43:48.797
You're my eighth
best friend in the world,

43:48.876 --> 43:51.470
and you stole from me.
From my home!

43:51.546 --> 43:53.799
You're gonna meet me
at that party at midnight.

43:54.674 --> 43:56.392
And if you don't
get my seven grand,

43:56.467 --> 43:58.140
let's just say
it's gonna be bad.

43:58.219 --> 44:00.221
Real fucking bad!

44:01.305 --> 44:02.898
Now get out of here!

44:03.015 --> 44:05.234
Stop staring at me
with those gorgeous eyes.

44:05.685 --> 44:06.732
All right, guys, let's go.

44:06.811 --> 44:07.812
Can we go home?

44:07.895 --> 44:09.238
No, I have to see somebody.

44:09.355 --> 44:11.323
I don't want to see anybody.
Let's just go home.

44:11.399 --> 44:13.572
Believe me, Slater, I don't want
to see this person, either.

44:15.319 --> 44:16.992
God damn it.

44:17.071 --> 44:18.573
Hey, Beth?

44:19.824 --> 44:22.668
Noah. What are
you doing here?

44:22.743 --> 44:25.246
I am babysitting
these children.

44:25.371 --> 44:27.339
Looks like we finally have
something in common, right?

44:27.415 --> 44:29.838
I'm not your
babysitter any more, Noah.

44:29.917 --> 44:32.761
Oh, you're not. That's right!
Because you fucked my dad

44:32.837 --> 44:35.932
while he was still married to my
mom and ruined my life. I forgot!

44:36.007 --> 44:37.350
Is he home, by the way?

44:39.510 --> 44:41.512
Seven thousand dollars?

44:42.889 --> 44:43.936
Yes.

44:44.056 --> 44:47.276
There is no way in hell I'm
giving you seven grand, so...

44:47.602 --> 44:52.529
Dad, you screwed Mom and I out
of child support and alimony.

44:52.607 --> 44:55.360
Just do this one thing.
We'll call it even. All right?

44:55.443 --> 44:59.448
You know, I have to say, it is
always some justification with you.

44:59.572 --> 45:01.950
You are never gonna grow up
with that attitude.

45:02.033 --> 45:04.957
Okay, don't do that.
Don't do that. Okay?

45:05.077 --> 45:07.455
Don't pretend like
you care how I turn out.

45:07.538 --> 45:10.462
Let's be very, very
straightforward with one another.

45:10.583 --> 45:11.630
Okay?

45:11.709 --> 45:12.710
Okay.

45:12.793 --> 45:15.216
I'm in a jam. Okay?

45:16.130 --> 45:18.224
That's why I'm here,
because I need your help.

45:18.299 --> 45:20.301
And I'm sorry.

45:20.384 --> 45:23.558
I just need you to be my dad for a day.
That's it.

45:23.638 --> 45:25.982
And I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

45:26.098 --> 45:29.648
You know what, pal?
It's not my problem.

45:29.727 --> 45:32.731
I mean, it's really
not my problem.

45:32.813 --> 45:34.656
Okay.

45:35.816 --> 45:38.569
Daddy? Can we look
at the telescope now?

45:38.653 --> 45:40.075
Oh, hey, buddy.

45:40.154 --> 45:42.498
Of course.
Excuse me a second.

45:42.573 --> 45:44.575
I want you to do me a favor.

45:44.659 --> 45:47.412
I want you to go in the kitchen
and get a little bite to eat

45:47.495 --> 45:49.748
for the two of us.
I'll be right in, okay?

45:50.289 --> 45:51.586
That a boy!

45:54.252 --> 45:57.677
There's a geomagnetic
storm tonight. I forgot.

45:57.797 --> 45:59.265
I got thrown off.

45:59.340 --> 46:01.183
So...
I didn't even know.

46:01.300 --> 46:02.847
Yeah, I have to go.

46:07.348 --> 46:11.603
You smell like perfume.
You got a lot of perfume on you.

46:11.686 --> 46:14.030
I know. I know I do.

46:17.108 --> 46:18.280
Why?

46:23.864 --> 46:25.366
Gotcha, bitch.

46:25.491 --> 46:27.619
- Shotgun!
- All right, come on, let's go!

46:27.702 --> 46:31.457
Let's roll. Hustle.
Rodrigo, feel free to take a piss in it.

46:31.539 --> 46:33.041
Fancy car.

46:33.165 --> 46:34.883
It smells like hotdogs.

46:38.337 --> 46:40.305
Was that woman at the door
your babysitter?

46:40.381 --> 46:43.385
She was, till I found out
my dad was tipping her extra

46:43.467 --> 46:45.060
when he'd drive
her home at night.

46:49.724 --> 46:50.816
Where are we going?

46:51.559 --> 46:52.981
Just got to pick up something

46:53.060 --> 46:54.482
from my dad's store real quick.

46:54.562 --> 46:55.859
You're breaking in?

46:57.898 --> 46:59.400
Not exactly.

46:59.483 --> 47:02.077
Shouldn't you tell
him about this or something?

47:06.073 --> 47:07.120
What's wrong?

47:07.199 --> 47:09.577
I'm typing in the code,
and it's not working.

47:09.660 --> 47:10.661
You didn't do it right!

47:10.745 --> 47:11.746
Yes, I did.

47:11.829 --> 47:12.830
I'm doing it right.

47:12.913 --> 47:14.210
Maybe your dad
changed the code.

47:14.290 --> 47:15.507
He didn't change the code.

47:15.583 --> 47:17.506
Okay? The code's my birthday.
It's always been my birthday.

47:17.585 --> 47:18.677
He didn't change it.

47:18.753 --> 47:20.596
Maybe it's
someone else's birthday.

47:32.850 --> 47:33.942
Sorry, man.

47:40.858 --> 47:42.781
Let me guess what it is.

47:50.076 --> 47:51.623
Booyah!

47:59.293 --> 48:00.886
Can I tell you my gossip now?

48:00.961 --> 48:02.634
Oh, shit, yeah. Blithe.

48:03.798 --> 48:06.301
Not now. I think we should go, okay?
Let's go. We gotta go.

48:07.551 --> 48:10.646
I saw my daddy
kissing his assistant, Debra.

48:11.806 --> 48:14.025
That's why he always <i>stays</i>
late at the hospital,

48:14.100 --> 48:17.149
'cause he spends
all night kissing Debra.

48:18.979 --> 48:20.572
My mom knows.

48:20.648 --> 48:24.573
She pretends like she doesn't
know, but she knows.

48:24.652 --> 48:26.495
That's not gossip, Blithe.

48:27.279 --> 48:28.781
You know that, right?

48:29.281 --> 48:30.498
Well...

48:30.574 --> 48:33.327
Sometimes people do messed-up
stuff to each other, okay?

48:33.786 --> 48:34.833
Why?

48:34.912 --> 48:36.630
One time I was
walking down the street,

48:36.705 --> 48:38.423
I punched my best friend Darius

48:38.499 --> 48:42.345
in the nut sack for no reason.
Just both fists.

48:42.461 --> 48:43.804
Just double-punched him.

48:43.879 --> 48:45.176
Why would you do that?

48:45.840 --> 48:46.966
I don't know.

48:47.675 --> 48:49.177
You're an idiot.

48:49.260 --> 48:51.012
That's probably true.
I am an idiot.

48:51.137 --> 48:52.605
And so is your dad.

48:53.097 --> 48:54.519
Come on.

48:56.642 --> 48:57.768
Hey.

48:58.185 --> 48:59.357
Where's Rodrigo?

48:59.437 --> 49:00.939
He's in the bathroom.

49:05.651 --> 49:07.278
Oh, no.

49:07.361 --> 49:10.535
No, tell me...
Tell me you didn't.

49:12.992 --> 49:14.369
Oh, shit!

49:23.794 --> 49:25.046
Why the hell did
you do that, Rodrigo?

49:25.129 --> 49:26.301
Seriously, dude!

49:26.380 --> 49:27.802
You said you didn't have
any more cherry bombs!

49:27.882 --> 49:29.225
How many more do you have, huh?

49:29.300 --> 49:32.144
You can't just go around blowing
up bathrooms! It's not cool!

49:32.219 --> 49:33.971
Why can't you be more like
your brother and sister?

49:34.054 --> 49:36.227
They're at least half crazy.
You're full-on nuts!

49:36.891 --> 49:39.440
They are not my brother and sister!
They are nothing to me!

49:39.518 --> 49:41.145
They are not my family!

49:41.228 --> 49:42.650
She does nothing
all day but paint

49:42.730 --> 49:44.073
her face like a <i>puta.</i>
She is a <i>puta!</i>

49:44.190 --> 49:45.191
And this one is
sick in the head!

49:45.274 --> 49:47.151
He goes to the head doctor
four times a week!

49:49.403 --> 49:51.155
HEY! Stop acting
crazy, okay?

49:51.238 --> 49:52.285
He is the crazy one.

49:52.364 --> 49:54.913
He has this medicine!
He <i>loco!</i> He <i>muy loco!</i>

49:55.034 --> 49:56.661
Hey, relax!
Shut up!

49:56.744 --> 49:58.997
You shut up with your stupid fanny pack!
I take your fanny pack!

49:59.079 --> 50:01.332
No! No! No, I need that!

50:01.415 --> 50:04.510
Stop it! I need that!
My pills! No! No!

50:04.585 --> 50:06.428
What did you do that for?

50:06.504 --> 50:07.505
Pull over!
Pull over!

50:07.588 --> 50:08.589
Okay! Okay!

50:08.714 --> 50:11.558
- Right now! Right now!
- Okay! Okay!

50:13.511 --> 50:15.513
Slater! Where are you going?

50:15.596 --> 50:17.348
What the fuck is
your problem, man?

50:23.062 --> 50:24.279
Slater.

50:24.396 --> 50:25.943
You're not going to
find it, all right?

50:26.023 --> 50:28.446
I need those pills, okay?
I need them.

50:28.526 --> 50:29.618
No, you don't.

50:29.693 --> 50:31.866
Yes, I do, okay?
I have serious issues.

50:31.946 --> 50:33.323
You don't have serious issues.

50:33.405 --> 50:36.454
Yes, I do! Those pills are the
only thing that keep me normal,

50:36.534 --> 50:37.877
and I need them!

50:37.952 --> 50:39.545
I can't do this any more.

50:39.620 --> 50:41.418
Slater, you're gay, all right?

50:42.540 --> 50:44.258
What the fuck are
you talking about?

50:44.333 --> 50:45.676
Nothing. Never mind.

50:45.751 --> 50:47.003
Take that back!

50:47.086 --> 50:49.259
Take it back, Noah!

50:50.464 --> 50:52.182
You're gay. All right?

50:52.258 --> 50:55.387
You're as queer as a football
bat, and that's fine.

50:55.469 --> 50:57.642
And if your therapist hasn't
clued you into that by now,

50:57.721 --> 50:59.644
then you should ask
for your money back, pal.

50:59.723 --> 51:01.896
You ever think
the reason you're so upset

51:01.976 --> 51:04.024
your buddy Clayton doesn't
want to hang out any more

51:04.103 --> 51:06.606
is because you have a lot
of special feelings for him

51:06.689 --> 51:08.236
that maybe
he doesn't feel back?

51:08.315 --> 51:09.942
It breaks your heart, man.

51:10.025 --> 51:11.777
And that breaks my heart.

51:11.860 --> 51:13.658
'Cause I know
what that feels like.

51:13.737 --> 51:15.455
I feel it all the time.

51:15.531 --> 51:18.159
I don't want to be gay!
I'm not gay!

51:18.576 --> 51:19.577
Tough.

51:19.660 --> 51:21.583
I don't want to be a faggot!

51:21.662 --> 51:24.165
Hey! Do not say shit like that!
Do you understand me?

51:24.832 --> 51:27.210
This is the worst night
of my life.

51:30.337 --> 51:32.931
All right, high school
is going to suck.

51:33.007 --> 51:36.853
Coming out to your parents, it's
not gonna be a picnic, either.

51:36.927 --> 51:38.895
But trust me when I tell you

51:38.971 --> 51:41.474
that when you get to college,
nobody will care.

51:41.557 --> 51:44.106
And then,
when you graduate college,

51:44.184 --> 51:47.154
you'll get an awesome job
in the entertainment industry.

51:47.229 --> 51:51.109
You'll be super-organized and dress
really well, you'll smell good.

51:51.191 --> 51:53.660
Smell good? What are you
talking about, Noah?

51:53.736 --> 51:55.363
Relax. Listen to me.

51:58.198 --> 52:00.917
My dad hates me. All right?

52:02.202 --> 52:04.204
I got kicked out of college.

52:06.749 --> 52:09.127
Before tonight,
this babysitting thing,

52:09.209 --> 52:11.507
I've only ever had one job,
and I was a lifeguard.

52:11.587 --> 52:13.464
I got fired after four days

52:13.547 --> 52:16.096
because I kept falling
asleep in the sun.

52:16.550 --> 52:18.678
I'm a constant
disappointment to my mom,

52:18.761 --> 52:20.855
who's the only
decent person in my life.

52:20.929 --> 52:22.897
I've been arrested
numerous times.

52:22.973 --> 52:25.943
I had a month-long, intense
addiction to Robitussin.

52:27.227 --> 52:29.275
There's only
one freak out here.

52:30.105 --> 52:31.607
You're looking at him.

52:32.566 --> 52:35.319
I've never had a gay thought in my
life, so what does that tell you?

52:36.570 --> 52:39.039
That tells me
you're pretty messed up.

52:39.114 --> 52:41.537
I have seen <i>Devil Wears Prada</i>
about 19 times,

52:41.617 --> 52:43.711
but that's because
it's a good movie.

52:43.786 --> 52:45.709
It's a good flick.

52:45.788 --> 52:48.962
<i>Devil Wears P.</i> You ever seen it?
<i>D Wears P?</i>

52:49.083 --> 52:51.506
I think, like, once.
I don't really remember it though.

52:52.795 --> 52:56.015
Nothing's wrong with you.
You're normal.

52:57.591 --> 52:59.810
Just super gay.

53:02.137 --> 53:04.060
You're a dick.

53:04.139 --> 53:07.609
Yes, that's true.
Enough of the pills, all right?

53:09.061 --> 53:10.233
Okay.

53:11.438 --> 53:12.860
You know,

53:14.149 --> 53:17.323
deep down, I think
I always kind of knew.

53:19.780 --> 53:22.659
But don't tell
anybody yet, okay?

53:22.783 --> 53:24.831
I won't. I won't.

53:26.286 --> 53:28.288
What do you think
lam, an asshole?

53:29.331 --> 53:30.833
Yeah, sort of.

53:30.958 --> 53:32.426
Come on, Ricky Martin,
let's get out of here.

53:32.501 --> 53:34.128
That's an example.

53:35.671 --> 53:38.049
Hey, Slater, are you okay?

53:38.132 --> 53:39.475
Yeah, I'm okay.

53:39.550 --> 53:41.928
Hey! That's Mom's car!

53:42.010 --> 53:43.057
Are you sure?

53:44.680 --> 53:46.398
All right.
Let's go! Let's go!

53:46.473 --> 53:49.317
Rodrigo’s jacket
must be in there!

54:19.506 --> 54:21.304
This is my kind of club.

54:21.383 --> 54:23.806
- Let's just go home.
- No.

54:23.886 --> 54:25.934
All right? I have a half-hour
to get to this party,

54:26.013 --> 54:27.765
pay off Karl,
pick my girlfriend up

54:27.848 --> 54:29.600
off the floor,
get you kids home,

54:29.683 --> 54:32.436
and be home in time for my mom to
tell me how awesome her night was.

54:32.519 --> 54:36.399
I'm not gonna let some bullshit
car thief fuck this up for me.

54:38.192 --> 54:39.318
Hey.

54:39.401 --> 54:41.699
What's happening, my man?
How you doing, man?

54:41.779 --> 54:44.498
You know, this ain't
no place for no kids.

54:44.573 --> 54:46.416
These aren't kids,
these are little people.

54:46.533 --> 54:48.251
This woman's 48 years old.

54:48.368 --> 54:49.665
Her children have children.

54:49.745 --> 54:51.292
Hi. I'm a grandma.

54:51.371 --> 54:52.463
All right.

54:52.539 --> 54:53.711
What's your name, baby?

54:53.791 --> 54:54.883
They call me Soul, Soul Baby.

54:54.958 --> 54:56.881
Soul Baby?
Keep it in control, baby.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.052
I hear you, baby.

54:58.128 --> 54:59.129
My name's
Noah J-Bird.

54:59.213 --> 55:00.635
Noah J-Bird.

55:00.714 --> 55:02.432
Oh, you like to fly.
I fly, baby.

55:02.549 --> 55:03.721
Fly, fly, fly away, baby.

55:03.801 --> 55:04.927
In the clouds, no frowns.

55:05.052 --> 55:06.349
All right, now, that's
what I'm talking about.

55:06.428 --> 55:07.475
Tears, no fears, man.

55:07.554 --> 55:08.555
Is that right?

55:08.639 --> 55:09.856
Respect it, don't neglect it.

55:09.932 --> 55:12.685
All right. That's what I'm
talking about, baby. My brother.

55:12.768 --> 55:14.395
Treat it, don't beat it, my man.
All right, baby.

55:14.937 --> 55:16.985
You're a badass motherfucker.

55:22.820 --> 55:24.618
Hey.

55:24.738 --> 55:27.366
God, man.
What's up, white boy?

55:27.449 --> 55:29.076
I'm here for my minivan.
What's up?

55:29.284 --> 55:31.662
Get out of here.

55:31.745 --> 55:34.168
What, are you stalking me now?
You're stealing my car?

55:34.248 --> 55:36.216
I'm serious.
Give me the keys.

55:36.291 --> 55:39.090
Look, homey, we got beef.
You understand that?

55:39.169 --> 55:40.386
Just give me the keys.

55:40.462 --> 55:43.181
Step back, homey!
This ain't where you belong!

55:43.257 --> 55:45.510
All right, you're going
to listen to me, okay?

55:45.592 --> 55:48.220
You're right, I threw up in
your grandmother's ashes.

55:48.303 --> 55:49.395
Hell, yeah, you did.

55:49.471 --> 55:50.518
It was an accident.

55:50.597 --> 55:51.814
Fucked up.

55:51.890 --> 55:54.018
I apologize from
the bottom of my heart.

55:54.101 --> 55:56.445
I have been stuck babysitting
these three kids.

55:56.520 --> 55:58.818
I was talked into buying
cocaine for my girlfriend,

55:58.939 --> 56:01.158
who I realize is not
even my girlfriend.

56:01.275 --> 56:03.528
She's just a girl
who occasionally

56:03.610 --> 56:05.112
lets me stick
my face in her crotch

56:05.195 --> 56:07.197
- and who's mean to me all the time.
- Okay?

56:07.281 --> 56:09.329
And this time, making her happy

56:09.408 --> 56:11.376
is probably
gonna get me killed.

56:11.451 --> 56:15.172
You're acting all gangster, stealing
cars, hanging out with thugs.

56:15.289 --> 56:16.290
Well, you know what?

56:16.373 --> 56:19.252
A few years ago we went to the
same lame-ass high school.

56:19.334 --> 56:22.759
The point is, you and I
are two fucked-up kids

56:22.838 --> 56:24.181
meeting on the playground.

56:24.298 --> 56:29.304
I came here for my motherfucking
keys to my motherfucking minivan,

56:29.386 --> 56:30.808
and that's what's up!

56:35.017 --> 56:36.690
Is that supposed to be
a threat, little man?

56:36.810 --> 56:37.936
I ain't giving you shit.

56:38.020 --> 56:39.146
It's not a threat.

56:39.229 --> 56:41.607
I'm going to put both my
hands behind my back,

56:41.690 --> 56:44.193
and you get one punch to my
face as hard as you want.

56:44.318 --> 56:45.911
I can punch you in the face?

56:45.986 --> 56:47.533
You deserve to
punch me in the face.

56:47.654 --> 56:49.406
Go on, baby.
Punch him in the face.

56:49.489 --> 56:51.332
My face
is ready to receive you.

56:52.159 --> 56:53.832
Noah, don't!
What?

56:53.994 --> 56:56.088
Oh!

56:56.330 --> 56:57.331
Bitch.

56:58.081 --> 56:59.549
Noah!

56:59.625 --> 57:01.047
I fucking love you right now.

57:02.044 --> 57:04.467
You killed my babysitter!

57:04.546 --> 57:05.763
Noah?

57:07.174 --> 57:08.847
That was bad.

57:08.926 --> 57:10.223
Are you okay?
Yeah.

57:11.511 --> 57:13.605
Oh, shit. I'm all right!

57:14.848 --> 57:16.816
I'm okay!

57:16.892 --> 57:18.394
I'm okay!

57:18.518 --> 57:19.895
She won this round, right?

57:20.020 --> 57:21.397
Oh, shit.

57:21.521 --> 57:24.024
She punched my face, but it's cool!
It's all good.

57:25.859 --> 57:27.236
Looks like we're even.

57:32.074 --> 57:35.078
Guess you ain't the little pussy
you used to be. Huh, Noah?

57:35.202 --> 57:37.671
Nope, I'm a whole
different pussy now.

57:37.746 --> 57:39.748
All right, boy. Respect.

57:41.249 --> 57:43.798
Unlock it. What's inside?

57:43.877 --> 57:45.550
Oh, shit, it's a bomb.

57:46.922 --> 57:49.266
Hell, yeah. I feel that.

57:49.383 --> 57:51.932
Let that debris
fall across your face, girl.

57:52.469 --> 57:53.891
Look here, little homey.

57:54.429 --> 57:56.022
I like your style, you dig?

57:56.098 --> 57:57.190
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

57:57.265 --> 57:59.108
You stand up for yours,
and I can respect that.

57:59.226 --> 58:04.027
If we ever need a crazy-ass white
boy to roll with us one day

58:04.106 --> 58:08.612
and get punched in the face by
motherfuckers, I'm-a call you.

58:08.735 --> 58:10.362
Know what I mean?

58:10.445 --> 58:11.662
Yeah, man.

58:11.738 --> 58:15.038
Yo, listen. Listen.
Let me holler at you for a second.

58:15.117 --> 58:16.494
I just wanna let you know,

58:16.576 --> 58:19.045
I just want to throw a monster
shout-out back at you, my man.

58:19.121 --> 58:20.919
Monster shout-out
back at me, right?

58:20.998 --> 58:22.420
I don't understand
what the fuck that is,

58:22.499 --> 58:23.876
but it sound good, though.

58:23.959 --> 58:25.506
It's all good, baby.
All right, brother.

58:25.585 --> 58:27.462
Peace to you.
I fucking love you, dawg.

58:29.756 --> 58:31.429
Noah, are you all right?

58:32.092 --> 58:34.265
I feel so cool right now.

58:36.346 --> 58:37.393
This place is cool.

58:37.472 --> 58:40.817
I honestly might start DJ-ing here.
I don't know.

58:40.934 --> 58:42.026
Okay, that's all right,

58:42.102 --> 58:44.981
but do you really think that this is
an appropriate place to bring kids?

58:45.105 --> 58:48.484
I don't know. Look, Rodrigo's over
there chatting up some prostitutes.

58:48.608 --> 58:52.238
You got Slater schooling Bell
Biv DeVoe over there in pool.

58:52.320 --> 58:55.540
And Blithe's doing the Riverdance
over in the bowling alley.

58:55.615 --> 58:56.787
Honestly,
this is the first time

58:56.867 --> 58:58.039
I've seen them
having any kind of fun,

58:58.118 --> 59:00.337
so what the hell?

59:04.875 --> 59:06.468
You know what that is?

59:06.543 --> 59:08.216
What is that?

59:08.295 --> 59:10.138
Just me being cool.
Playing it cool.

59:11.173 --> 59:13.050
No big deal.

59:13.133 --> 59:14.225
You're crazy.

59:14.301 --> 59:16.429
You're crazy
slash beautiful. Whatever.

59:21.850 --> 59:24.069
So, did you drive here?

59:24.144 --> 59:25.521
No, I took a cab.

59:25.645 --> 59:27.113
Maybe you should
take my dad's car,

59:27.189 --> 59:29.408
because I can't drive
both of them anyways.

59:29.483 --> 59:31.030
Are you serious?

59:31.109 --> 59:33.077
Yeah, it'd actually
really help me out.

59:33.153 --> 59:34.871
Okay. How are
you gonna find me?

59:34.946 --> 59:36.539
Do you have a phone?

59:39.201 --> 59:40.748
Okay. See you.

59:40.827 --> 59:42.044
Yeah.

59:42.120 --> 59:43.292
Just kidding.

59:43.371 --> 59:46.921
Here, this is my phone number,
and then you can call me.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.752
Okay.

59:49.669 --> 59:51.387
I'll call you.

59:52.172 --> 59:53.594
Hey, uh,

59:53.673 --> 59:55.425
why did you say something to me

59:55.509 --> 59:57.182
when you saw me earlier?
I feel like

59:57.260 --> 59:59.683
you kind of ignored me
all freshman year.

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:05.569
I don't know. I thought you
were really funny and smart

01:00:05.685 --> 01:00:07.278
and seemed really sweet.

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:11.234
I guess I was kind of nervous
to talk to you back then.

01:00:12.567 --> 01:00:15.036
You were nervous to talk to me?

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:17.076
Yeah.

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:21.039
My phone's ringing.

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:24.538
Shit, it's my girlfriend.
I'm sorry. I have to take this.

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:26.043
Girlfriend.
Yeah.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.132
Hello?

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:30.877
All right. See you later.

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:31.962
Call me about the car.

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:33.842
Yeah.
Noah.

01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:35.924
<i>Listen to me You need
to leave that party right now.</i>

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:39.098
Noah, this party is breathtaking,
so I'm not gonna leave it.

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:40.937
Breathtaking?
Marisa, listen to me.

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:45.230
<i>You need to listen to me.
You have been jerking me around all night.</i>

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:48.778
And you wanna know what?
It's disrespectful and it's lame.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:51.364
Just, if Karl and Julio show
up, stay away from them.

01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:52.486
They're dangerous.

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:54.364
<i>They're not dangerous.
You're being an idiot.</i>

01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:57.161
I'm very close.
I'm coming for you, Marisa, okay?

01:00:57.237 --> 01:00:58.454
<i>Okay.</i>

01:01:01.283 --> 01:01:03.081
Oh, shit.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:08.503
I can't decide if
this is funny or not.

01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:10.380
It's not funny at all.

01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:11.880
How you doing tonight, my man?

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:13.845
Do you have any idea
why I stopped you?

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.297
No.
You ran a red light

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:17.178
and you're not
wearing your seat belt.

01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:19.680
All right, why don't you
step out of the car, pal?

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:21.682
Do me a favor.
Put your hands on the trunk.

01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:23.013
Easy, cowboy.

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:24.222
What's this?

01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:25.649
It's a <i>luchador</i> action figure.

01:01:25.724 --> 01:01:27.021
Luchadors, I love these guys.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.352
Look at this.

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:29.982
Frank, what's in there?

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:31.904
What's this, my man?

01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:34.111
You got a little
party in your pocket?

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:35.818
It's not mine, I swear to God.

01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:38.120
I'm just holding it
for my girlfriend.

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:39.242
I'm just holding it for her.

01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:40.368
You're going out
with a cokehead?

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:42.415
Bag of fucking
actual diamonds here.

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:45.710
Oh. Okay. Jacob the Jeweler.
You're tits in a ditch, my man.

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:47.708
Tits in a ditch.
Is that good?

01:01:47.787 --> 01:01:50.085
Sometimes it's good.
Sometimes it's real bad.

01:01:50.165 --> 01:01:53.044
What is that?
Oh, no shit!

01:01:53.168 --> 01:01:54.886
Is that you?
That's the fucking bathroom guy!

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:56.884
Mr. Toilet Explosion?
That's not me.

01:01:56.963 --> 01:01:58.886
I've never actually
been the guy on duty

01:01:58.965 --> 01:02:00.808
to catch the fucking
guy in the sketch.

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:02.227
What are they doing to him?

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:04.179
Do me a favor.
You got this? Yeah.

01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:09.059
You got it?
Yeah. I like that.

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:10.985
That's one for your wallet.
Check it out! Check it out!

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.313
It's great.
All right, sir, do me a favor,

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.442
go stand by your vehicle.

01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:15.319
We're going to run
your profile. All right?

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:18.026
This is mine.
I'm gonna take responsibility...

01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:21.155
Sir! Go stand by your vehicle.
Please.

01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:25.325
Hey, so here's the deal.

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:27.126
I think I'm about
to get arrested.

01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:29.796
I messed up and I put
your lives in danger.

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:31.043
You's got the diamonds?

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:32.586
Things just got out of
hand so quickly...

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:33.792
Let's party!

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:34.967
And I'm really, really sorry.

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:38.221
Whoa. Are they leaving?

01:02:38.338 --> 01:02:40.466
Hey! What are
you doing? Stop!

01:02:40.548 --> 01:02:42.767
Please! I need those diamonds!
Come back!

01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:44.810
Damn it!

01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:07.162
All right, I'm going to
go find my girlfriend.

01:03:07.242 --> 01:03:09.040
Marisa!

01:03:10.745 --> 01:03:12.088
Marisa!

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:16.589
Stephanie,
have you seen Marisa?

01:03:16.668 --> 01:03:19.592
I don't know, it's my birthday!

01:03:19.671 --> 01:03:20.797
Why are you upside down?

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.302
Why aren't you upside down?

01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:23.474
Okay.

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:24.597
Take care of yourself.

01:03:24.676 --> 01:03:26.678
You're not invited any more.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.102
G-Bert, sorry to
interrupt, man.

01:03:30.724 --> 01:03:32.067
What's up, Noah?

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:33.564
Have you seen Marisa?

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:34.986
Who's Marisa?
She's my girlfriend.

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:36.483
She's like my height,
blonde hair.

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:39.274
No, sorry.
No.

01:03:39.357 --> 01:03:41.655
If I find her, we should all
hang out next week or something.

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:42.782
Totally, yeah.

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:43.987
Yeah, great.
You have great breasts. Thanks.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:45.287
Thank you.
Later, Noah.

01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:50.626
What are you doing?
Fuck you.

01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:54.206
Why are you such
an asshole, Rodrigo?

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:57.667
Ever since
you moved in with us,

01:03:57.751 --> 01:03:59.549
you've been so mean
to everybody!

01:03:59.627 --> 01:04:01.721
What's wrong with you?

01:04:01.796 --> 01:04:03.139
You want to know
what's wrong with me?

01:04:03.214 --> 01:04:05.012
This is my third family
in three years.

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:06.559
When your papas
get tired with me,

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:08.056
they give me to
another families.

01:04:08.136 --> 01:04:09.433
That happens every time.

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:12.516
Well, maybe if you didn't do
such messed-up stuff

01:04:12.599 --> 01:04:15.853
then they would actually feel
like you wanted to be here.

01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:17.608
You don't know me.
You look at me

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:19.280
like a crazy that live
in your house.

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:21.859
That's not true.
You never talk to us.

01:04:21.941 --> 01:04:25.161
Honestly,
you're pretty scary, man.

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:29.616
I no scary.
I just like having fun.

01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:31.535
Boom, boom, boom. Kaboom.

01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:33.962
Hey, guys, I can't find
Marisa anywhere. Let's go.

01:04:34.245 --> 01:04:35.747
Come on. Where's Blithe?

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:40.301
Blithe, get down from there.
We have to go.

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:42.471
These are my friends!
Come on, we're having fun.

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:43.762
No. They're not your friends.

01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:45.681
They're drunk and they're
making fun of you, okay?

01:04:45.799 --> 01:04:47.722
You need to get down here right now.
What are you doing?

01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:49.269
Listen, they're drunk.
Let's go.

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:50.470
Come up here!

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:51.679
They just want
to dance with me!

01:04:51.763 --> 01:04:52.810
They don't want to dance...

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:54.687
Oh! You're here!

01:04:54.766 --> 01:04:57.770
Where have you been?
This has been the best night ever.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.526
Are those kids?
Yeah. They're with me.

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:01.944
I'll explain.
We need to get out of here right now.

01:05:02.023 --> 01:05:03.821
Did you get the party favors?

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.743
I had them and now I don't.
I'll explain.

01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:07.571
We need to get out
of here right now.

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:09.577
I'm serious.
It's Ricky.

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:10.748
We don't have time for this.

01:05:10.824 --> 01:05:12.622
That is Ricky Fontaine.
He is my ex-boyfriend.

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:14.327
I obviously have to go say hi.

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:15.583
Ricky!

01:05:15.662 --> 01:05:16.754
You're drunk, Marisa.

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:18.415
Hey.

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:19.670
Marisa.

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:21.046
What's up? How are you?

01:05:21.126 --> 01:05:24.255
You haven't responded to any of my
texts in, like, a really long time.

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:26.339
Yeah. There's a reason
for that.

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:30.348
Marisa, I'm sorry.
I don't know how else I can say it.

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:33.180
We had a great run,
but it's over now,

01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:35.607
and I wish you the best
and I pray for you, I do.

01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:37.479
Is everything okay?

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:41.279
Actually, no.
Ricky's being kind of a dick.

01:05:41.354 --> 01:05:42.446
Why don't you defend me, Noah?

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:43.523
What?

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:45.574
Yeah. You're being
a real dick!

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:47.277
Defend me!
You're being mean!

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.579
What are you talking about?
I've been nothing but cool to you, man.

01:05:49.654 --> 01:05:51.156
Okay. She's drunk.

01:05:51.239 --> 01:05:53.913
There's a misunderstanding happening.
Why don't we all just relax?

01:05:55.243 --> 01:05:57.120
No offense, bro,
but who are you?

01:05:57.203 --> 01:05:58.546
I'm Noah. We're dating.

01:05:58.621 --> 01:05:59.918
He's my friend.

01:05:59.998 --> 01:06:01.796
We're in a relationship, okay?

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:03.923
Friendship relationship.

01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:05.094
Well, good luck with that, bro,

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:07.298
'cause dealing with her
is a pretty big nightmare.

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:08.882
I don't envy you.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.935
That is a terrible thing
to say to somebody!

01:06:12.552 --> 01:06:13.599
What?

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:17.148
Look, you hurt her feelings.
Okay? Just be nice.

01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:19.146
What are you going
to do about it, bro?

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:21.356
What?

01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:25.402
What the hell was that?

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:28.986
A throat jab? I don't know.
I don't street-fight very often.

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:32.451
Shit!

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.787
I broke my ass!

01:06:34.866 --> 01:06:37.335
You just got Fontained!

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.337
Are you okay, Noah?

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:40.834
Yeah.

01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:43.758
Get out of here.
I got it. I got this guy.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.585
Right here. Right here.

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:49.923
Noah!

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.679
Oh, that's bad!
Oh, my back!

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:52.850
What do we do?

01:06:52.926 --> 01:06:54.928
Rodrigo! Flying Burrito!

01:06:58.181 --> 01:07:00.058
Jesus! My ear!

01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:01.734
Did I get him good?

01:07:01.809 --> 01:07:03.482
Get off!

01:07:03.561 --> 01:07:04.608
Hey. Ricky!

01:07:08.149 --> 01:07:09.947
Double punch to the nut sack!

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:13.446
Come on, Blithe!
We gotta get out of here!

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:14.531
Ricky? Are you okay?

01:07:15.573 --> 01:07:16.665
Listen, we gotta go right now.

01:07:16.741 --> 01:07:18.288
Where's the party?
I love parties.

01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:20.377
Oh, shit! We gotta go right now!
Hey, what's up, party animal?

01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:21.955
How you doing?
Hey, man...

01:07:23.122 --> 01:07:24.339
Karl!

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:30.047
Come on, come on.

01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:32.097
Who wants to party?

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:35.386
Anybody want to party?
Let's party!

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:39.564
Back it up! Back it up!

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.892
What's up?

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:42.976
Nobody wanna dance with me!

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:44.060
Let's party!

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:50.233
Come on, you got it.
Let's go. You got it.

01:07:50.316 --> 01:07:51.738
I can't believe
you're making me do this.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:55.413
Where are the kids?
Who cares? Let's just go.

01:07:55.488 --> 01:07:56.865
Please, I just want
to go home with you.

01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:58.245
I just want to get out of here.

01:07:58.324 --> 01:08:00.668
What are you talking about?
They're my responsibility.

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:02.871
Who cares? I just
want to get out of here!

01:08:02.954 --> 01:08:04.376
I care.

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:06.795
Hi.

01:08:06.874 --> 01:08:08.421
What the fuck?
Hey, come on.

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:10.174
Come here!

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:12.551
Go, go, go, go, go! Move!

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:14.007
How'd you learn
to hot-wire a car?

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.467
I know many things.

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:17.223
What is with all these kids?

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:22.273
What is that?

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:23.770
It's Karl's gang.

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:27.187
Go! They gonna kill us!

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:28.647
Oh, my God!

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:30.232
Oh, my God!

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:32.984
Get off the car!

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:35.694
Oh, my God!
Is that a man or a woman?

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:37.529
Go, Noah!
Fucking drive, Noah!

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.241
Push the gas!

01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:51.631
What the hell is going on?

01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:54.180
Next time, you use a bazooka
instead of a sledgehammer.

01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:55.551
What are you, El DeBarge?

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.600
Let's go, come on, Jeremy!

01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:59.219
What the hell is this?
Get out of the way!

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:01.808
Is there anyone in
this car who can tell me

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:03.231
what the hell is going on here?

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:04.478
Noah, they're coming!

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:06.229
Gonna kill yo ass,
Noah Griffith!

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:07.810
Coming to get you!
Catch up!

01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:09.316
Fucking die! You die!

01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:11.022
All right, kids,
fasten your seat belts!

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:18.450
They're going to kill us!

01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:23.709
Watch this.
Watch this.

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:27.537
Ls everyone okay?

01:09:27.622 --> 01:09:29.124
I'm scared, Noah!

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:30.959
Noah, stall them!
I have an idea!

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:32.464
Roll down the window!

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:35.513
I have your money!
I just want to be your friend!

01:09:35.587 --> 01:09:37.180
Are you serious?
You've been really

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:38.849
wishy-washy about
the whole thing.

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:41.178
No, I know! I've been going through
my own personal situation!

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:43.729
It's really scary entering
into a new friendship!

01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:45.557
I just don't want to deal
with a broken heart.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.893
Maybe I don't want to be friends!
How's that?

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:50.319
He really wants to
be your friend, Karl!

01:09:50.395 --> 01:09:52.568
It's just I've been
burned in the past, bud!

01:09:52.647 --> 01:09:54.524
- Seriously?
- Kaboom!

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:55.699
Oh, shit!

01:09:59.654 --> 01:10:01.372
Shit!
Hold the wheel straight!

01:10:02.949 --> 01:10:04.292
Wait, wait!

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:06.123
Oh, shit!

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:10.707
Yes! Nice!

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:13.626
Whoa! Shit!

01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:20.345
Are you guys Okay?

01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:22.894
No. I'm not okay.
We just crashed the car.

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:24.562
What just happened?

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:26.810
Wait, so did you get the coke?

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.939
Kids, kids, kids.
I love kids.

01:10:30.017 --> 01:10:31.564
How you doing, Noah Griffith?

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:33.521
Hey, Karl, why you
got to be so crazy, man?

01:10:33.604 --> 01:10:34.821
Hey, man, I'm crazy.

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:36.069
That's a gun.

01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:38.572
Marisa, why don't you do me a favor?
Take these kids and go home.

01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:40.995
I'm going to have an adult
conversation with the babysitter.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:43.539
Look, I know you guys want to
stay with me, it's your instinct,

01:10:43.614 --> 01:10:47.369
but you have to
fend for yourself.

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:51.547
Oh, you're all alone now, huh?

01:10:53.124 --> 01:10:54.250
Hurts, don't it?

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:56.802
Yeah. I got a little
boo-boo myself.

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:02.388
You're mean!
Noah Griffith!

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:08.932
You got mud in my gun,
Noah Griffith!

01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:11.814
My 11th best friend
gave me this gun!

01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:14.403
Marisa, wait!
Did you hear that?

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:17.740
No, I didn't hear anything.

01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:19.863
It's your very childlike
and vivid imagination.

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:21.068
Noah might be hurt!

01:11:21.152 --> 01:11:22.199
That's a <i>pistola.</i>

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:23.450
What if he needs us?

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:26.328
He's not in trouble.
He's hugging it out with Karl in the minivan.

01:11:40.755 --> 01:11:42.803
I just need to get out of here.

01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:44.850
Thanks to you guys,
my night is ruined!

01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:47.600
I was having a really fun night
before you showed up! Taxi!

01:11:47.678 --> 01:11:49.100
We were supposed to
have a fun night, too!

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:51.683
You are the reason that we
are even in this situation!

01:11:51.766 --> 01:11:54.485
Okay, fine!
I'm a terrible person.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.983
Okay? I admit it, I could be a
lot better in this situation,

01:11:57.063 --> 01:12:00.317
but I'm just feeling really overwhelmed.
I don't know what's going on.

01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:03.369
I'm stuck with these three
kids and I hate kids,

01:12:03.444 --> 01:12:05.287
and I just don't
know what to do!

01:12:05.363 --> 01:12:07.661
Marisa?
Stop being such a spaz.

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.084
Give me your phone.
I've got an idea.

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:11.752
Noah Griffith!

01:12:11.828 --> 01:12:14.877
Yes! Where you at, babycakes?

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:17.258
Where you at?

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:19.590
I see you, Noah Griffith.

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:22.054
Yes!

01:12:24.048 --> 01:12:25.425
Noah Griffith?

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:28.140
Good game!

01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:32.978
You passed the test!
Passed the prank! Passed the car chase.

01:12:33.057 --> 01:12:34.559
You're in the club, player!

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:37.691
Surprise!

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:39.192
Stay back! Back up!

01:12:39.272 --> 01:12:40.694
Whoa! Okay. Chill out.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:43.276
Listen to me.
I don't have your money.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:46.283
And I'm going to stop risking
my life to get it for you.

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:48.285
Rodrigo took an egg
from your house.

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:50.241
It exploded,
it's gone, I'm sorry.

01:12:50.324 --> 01:12:51.997
What do you think
this is, a game?

01:12:52.076 --> 01:12:54.955
You don't fuck with a drug dealer.
Are you out of your mind?

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:56.789
You owe me money!

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:58.591
I got a call from a little lady

01:12:58.666 --> 01:13:01.044
said there was some trouble
brewing in the park tonight.

01:13:01.127 --> 01:13:02.299
Lookit here.

01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:04.005
Oh, shit.

01:13:04.088 --> 01:13:06.762
What's going down on the playground?
What up, Noah?

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:08.263
What are you guys doing here?

01:13:08.342 --> 01:13:11.471
Told you, we'd be around.
What y'all up to?

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:13.727
This guy, he's crazy.
He's trying to kill me!

01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:15.274
He's trying to kill the kids
I'm babysitting.

01:13:15.349 --> 01:13:16.896
He's nuts!
He's out of his mind.

01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:18.569
- Who? This stinky bitch?
- Yes.

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:22.194
Let me find out you out here
trying to punk on our boy Noah?

01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:25.903
Fuck is wrong with you?
You don't know who you're messing with.

01:13:25.985 --> 01:13:28.408
He's one misunderstood
motherfucker.

01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:29.454
Sure you right.

01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:31.578
But I got your back now, Noah.

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:34.376
'Cause I found out you got
some big-ass balls, man.

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:36.955
Can't buy underwear.
Balls don't fit.

01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:39.166
You done messed
with the wrong babysitter.

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:41.751
You so sexy when
you talk gangsta.

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:44.011
Look here, Noah.

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:46.259
Why don't you take
them little kids home?

01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:48.592
We gonna handle
this situation here.

01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:52.474
Thank you, guys, so much.
Soul Baby, text you.

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:54.476
Make love to the night,
motherfucker.

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:57.900
Noah Griffith! Where are you going?
I'm not done with you!

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:01.191
You think your friends are
gonna bail you out of this?

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:02.522
Listen, I'm in a real bad mood.

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:03.822
I don't want to
hurt you motherfuckers.

01:14:03.898 --> 01:14:05.241
What's up, candy man?

01:14:05.316 --> 01:14:06.863
We're gonna get up in it, boy.

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:09.492
Put a quarter in my butt.
Let's get this fight farted. Let's go.

01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:14.159
Motherfuckers!

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:16.703
Ahh! My nuts!

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:23.960
Taxi!

01:14:26.337 --> 01:14:27.634
I need a cab, man!

01:14:27.713 --> 01:14:29.556
Hey, man,
your nuts are on fire!

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:31.430
I know my nuts are on fire!

01:14:32.551 --> 01:14:34.019
That's how your mama like it!

01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:35.813
- Noah!
- Are you okay?

01:14:35.888 --> 01:14:37.856
Yeah, it's too crazy
to explain. We gotta go!

01:14:37.932 --> 01:14:39.024
What happened?

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:40.192
Was that a real gun?

01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:47.654
<i>Let me tell you about my day.</i>

01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:50.327
<i>It's such a very long day.</i>

01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:52.997
<i>It started around 7:00.</i>

01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:55.245
<i>And I can hear her pray.</i>

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:58.749
<i>As I walk through the yard.</i>

01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:01.001
<i>I could feel your presence.</i>

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.424
<i>Giving me the time of my life.</i>

01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:05.509
<i>And showering me
with life lessons.</i>

01:15:05.584 --> 01:15:08.007
<i>Now I know what they mean.</i>

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:11.091
<i>When they said
keep your head to the sky.</i>

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:13.426
<i>Don't be too quick to fit in.</i>

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:15.932
<i>And don't feel you have to try.</i>

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:19.899
<i>This road is strange,
so strange it is.</i>

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:23.186
<i>You know it really hurts inside.</i>

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:25.112
<i>Yeah, sometimes.</i>

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:31.448
We're here.

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:34.455
We're here.

01:15:37.867 --> 01:15:40.290
You must think
I'm such a bitch.

01:15:42.705 --> 01:15:44.252
You shouldn't
waste your feelings

01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:45.878
on people who don't value them.

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:50.255
You're right.

01:15:50.337 --> 01:15:51.429
I haven't been cool to you.

01:15:51.505 --> 01:15:52.597
I know.

01:15:52.673 --> 01:15:55.768
You haven't.
And I'm over it, too.

01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:01.853
Take care of yourself, Marisa.
All right?

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.947
Your girlfriend sucks.

01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:17.623
Yes, she does.

01:16:17.698 --> 01:16:20.042
Indeed she does.

01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:22.495
Blithe, I want to
show you something.

01:16:23.662 --> 01:16:25.539
Just because you try and
look more grown up,

01:16:25.623 --> 01:16:28.092
or try and act
like a celebrity,

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:30.590
or a famous person or whatever,

01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:32.467
it's not gonna
get you more friends.

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:34.557
You're a kid.

01:16:34.632 --> 01:16:36.305
And a pretty great one.

01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:42.098
Wipe that shit off your face.

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:43.603
You look insane, okay?

01:16:43.682 --> 01:16:44.899
Okay.

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:51.274
You know what "blithe" means?

01:16:51.357 --> 01:16:53.200
What?

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:54.902
It means "joyous."

01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:03.206
You know what "late" means?

01:17:03.744 --> 01:17:04.961
What?
"Late",

01:17:05.037 --> 01:17:07.665
As in fucked, as in we were all
supposed to be in bed by 1:00

01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:09.000
and it's already 10 after.

01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:10.551
Son of a bitch!

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:17.012
All right, looks like we beat them home.
Let's go inside. Hustle.

01:17:37.027 --> 01:17:38.370
Rodrigo!

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:44.835
Rodrigo!

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:47.330
Hey! You guys see Rodrigo?

01:17:47.413 --> 01:17:48.915
Hola, Rodrigo!

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:51.342
Rodrigo! Rodrigo!

01:17:52.751 --> 01:17:54.253
Whoa. Weird.

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:56.259
That's the most messed up
thing we've seen all night.

01:18:03.387 --> 01:18:04.639
Noah, they're here!

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:06.812
Okay! Everyone on the couch!
Let's go.

01:18:06.891 --> 01:18:08.438
Let's go! Get on the couch.
Come on!

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:12.605
<i>The MMA world is abuzz tonight</i>

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:15.032
<i>with the news of a brutal
out-of-the-ring assault</i>

01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:18.953
<i>on local hero and pro kickboxing

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:22.373
<i>Witnesses at the Brooklyn house
party where the assault took place</i>

01:18:22.448 --> 01:18:25.042
<i>described his attacker
as a young man,</i>

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:27.290
<i>accompanied by
three small children.</i>

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:28.871
<i>Oh, my God.
In another story,</i>

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:32.128
<i>two small New York businesses experienced
bizarre bathroom explosions.</i>

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:33.255
Hello.

01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:34.335
Hey, guys!

01:18:34.418 --> 01:18:35.465
Hi. What?

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:37.797
Hey! Welcome back!

01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:40.470
What's going on?
It's after 1:00 in the morning.

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:42.551
These kids should be
in bed already, Noah.

01:18:42.635 --> 01:18:44.057
Mom, it's not his fault.

01:18:44.136 --> 01:18:46.639
Yeah. We told him
our bedtime was 1:30.

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:50.443
I turned the clock back. So sorry.
My deepest apologies.

01:18:51.018 --> 01:18:52.235
You darn kids!

01:18:52.311 --> 01:18:54.279
Played a trick on me,
these little rascals.

01:18:54.355 --> 01:18:55.607
I'm not buying it.

01:18:55.689 --> 01:18:58.363
Everybody, upstairs.
Bed! Now.

01:18:58.442 --> 01:18:59.489
Go brush your teeth.

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:00.569
Sorry, Mom.

01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:02.621
And say good night to Noah.

01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:05.040
Maybe he'll be nice enough to
come back and babysit again.

01:19:05.115 --> 01:19:06.492
Night, Noah.

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:07.667
Night, guys.

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:09.211
And Peter has your money, okay?

01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:10.458
Cool, thanks.

01:19:10.537 --> 01:19:11.663
Oh, Noah!

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:14.170
Your mom told me to tell you
not to wait up for her.

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:15.843
She and that guy
that I set her up with,

01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:17.420
Dr. Stevens, went out
to have a nightcap.

01:19:17.503 --> 01:19:20.723
Let me tell you, I think she
was having a really good time.

01:19:20.798 --> 01:19:22.095
Thanks for hooking that up.

01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:23.300
Thanks for babysitting.

01:19:23.384 --> 01:19:24.476
See you next time.

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:29.732
I trust the kids
weren't too much trouble.

01:19:29.807 --> 01:19:31.525
You got three great ones.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.022
Hey...

01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:34.570
You want a recommendation?

01:19:34.645 --> 01:19:36.238
Here's my advice.

01:19:37.564 --> 01:19:39.157
Get your shit together.

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:42.035
You're right.

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:44.785
Maybe I do have some stuff
I need to work on.

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:46.115
But the last person on Earth

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:49.042
I need to take advice
from is you, sir.

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:50.870
Excuse me?

01:19:51.287 --> 01:19:54.632
You're banging your assistant,
Debra, and you're going to stop.

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:55.924
Do you understand me?

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.844
I would be very careful
how you talk to me.

01:19:58.919 --> 01:20:01.422
You'd better be very careful
how you talk to me.

01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:04.224
Because I'm going to be at
home with nothing going on.

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.678
And I'm going to have one eye
on my three friends up there

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:10.606
and the other eye right on you.

01:20:10.681 --> 01:20:12.775
I just want you to get
your act together, Doc.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.068
Fucking...

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:18.272
One more thing.
Your wife's smoking hot.

01:20:18.355 --> 01:20:21.074
You need to get rid of Debra
and focus on tapping that ass.

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:26.614
And there may be a scratch
or two on your minivan!

01:20:43.047 --> 01:20:44.469
Hey, stranger!

01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:46.471
Need a ride?

01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:55.900
Hey, Roxanne. What's up?
Hey.

01:20:55.976 --> 01:20:57.193
How'd you find me?

01:20:57.269 --> 01:21:01.274
Oh, this little gizmo kept beeping,
so I followed it to find you.

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:03.485
Which is a little creepy
now that I think about it.

01:21:04.485 --> 01:21:06.362
That's okay.
Thank you for stalking me.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.702
Shit.

01:21:10.783 --> 01:21:13.036
Oh. Let me guess.
Your girlfriend again?

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:14.461
No.

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:15.958
We broke up.

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:18.461
Oh. And you're just fine?
You seem fine.

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.463
Yeah, no, I'm great.

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:24.888
She's in hysterics, but she'll be
cool, eventually. She'll move on.

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:28.885
- Listen, I'm a free bird.
- I got to fly.

01:21:28.967 --> 01:21:30.810
Right.

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:32.729
I don't know why I said that.

01:21:34.431 --> 01:21:35.933
Do you need to get that?

01:21:36.016 --> 01:21:37.518
It's my dad, actually.

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:40.278
I think I'm gonna let this
one go to voice mail.

01:21:40.354 --> 01:21:41.822
Great.

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:44.400
I have an idea.
Why don't we ditch the car?

01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:46.990
It's a nice night for a walk.

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:49.663
Okay. Sure.

01:21:50.697 --> 01:21:51.789
Cool.

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.252
Looks like you had
a rough night.

01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:04.427
Yeah.

01:22:04.503 --> 01:22:06.847
But like a wise man
once told me,

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:09.175
"Make love to the night,
motherfucker."

01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:10.350
"Make love to the night."

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:14.389
<i>Have you ever met a girl
that you tried to date.</i>

01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:17.350
<i>But a year, to make love,
she wanted you to wait.</i>

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:19.811
<i>Let me tell ya a story
of my situation.</i>

01:22:19.893 --> 01:22:23.067
<i>I was talkin' to this girl
from the U. S. nation.</i>

01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:25.775
<i>The way that I met her
was on tour at a concert.</i>

01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:28.486
<i>She had really long hair
and a short miniskirt.</i>

01:22:28.569 --> 01:22:31.288
<i>I just got onstage
drippin', pourin' with sweat.</i>

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:34.162
<i>I was walkin' through the
crowd and guess who I met.</i>

01:22:34.241 --> 01:22:36.869
<i>I whispered in her ear,
come to the picture booth.</i>

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:39.922
<i>So I can ask you some questions to
see if you are a hundred proof.</i>

01:22:39.997 --> 01:22:42.546
<i>I asked her her name,
she said blah-blah-blah.</i>

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:45.628
<i>She had 9/10 pants
and a very big bra.</i>

01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:48.305
<i>I took a couple of flicks
and she was enthused.</i>

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:49.506
<i>I said,
how do you like the show?</i>

01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:51.388
<i>She said, I was very amused.</i>

01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:54.141
<i>I started throwin' bass, she
started throwin' back mid-range.</i>

01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:56.938
<i>But when I sprung the question,
she acted kind of strange</i>

01:22:57.014 --> 01:23:00.143
<i>'Cause when I asked, Do you have a man?
She tried to pretend.</i>

01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:04.025
<i>She said, no, I don't
I only have a friend.</i>

01:23:04.104 --> 01:23:06.106
<i>You must be buggin'.</i>

01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:07.908
<i>This is what I'm gonna sing.</i>

01:23:08.567 --> 01:23:13.573
<i>You, you got what I need.</i>

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:16.579
<i>But you say he's just a friend.</i>

01:23:16.658 --> 01:23:20.162
<i>And you say he's just
a friend Oh, baby.</i>

01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:24.921
<i>You got what I need.</i>

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:28.087
<i>But you say he's just a friend.</i>

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:31.674
<i>But you say he's just
a friend Oh, baby.</i>

01:23:31.757 --> 01:23:36.388
<i>You got what I need.</i>

01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:42.398
<i>But you say he's just a friend.</i>

01:23:42.476 --> 01:23:44.945
<i>So please listen
to the message that I say.</i>

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:48.024
<i>Don't ever talk to a girl who
says she just has a friend.</i>

01:23:48.106 --> 01:23:50.655
<i>Has a friend.</i>

01:23:56.657 --> 01:23:57.704
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:23:57.783 --> 01:23:59.285

<i>Are you peeping this floozy

<i>Can't believe how many times I
had to eat the chick's sushi.</i>

<i>Who she?</i>

01:24:19.846 --> 01:24:21.348
