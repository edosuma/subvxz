00:13.999 --> 00:14.999
- Previously on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:15.999 --> 00:17.999
- Where is my husband?

00:17.999 --> 00:18.999
Can someone find him for me,
please?

00:18.999 --> 00:21.999
- Scheana is always
the star in that relationship.

00:21.999 --> 00:23.999
And Shay is back
in the background.

00:23.999 --> 00:25.999
- No, no, no!
Damn!

00:25.999 --> 00:27.999
- You are the most
beautiful girl.

00:27.999 --> 00:28.999
- James is a drunken ass****.

00:28.999 --> 00:31.999
- James ends up with Jenna.
- We didn't have sex, Kristen.

00:31.999 --> 00:34.999
The truth is Jenna and I
were definitely boning.

00:34.999 --> 00:36.999
I love you.
- Playtime's over.

00:36.999 --> 00:38.999
Our service needs tweaking.

00:38.999 --> 00:40.999
- We're doing the best
that we can.

00:40.999 --> 00:41.999
- Well, the best
isn't good enough.

00:41.999 --> 00:43.999
I'm always looking
for perfection.

00:43.999 --> 00:45.999
Everbody's being welcoming.

00:45.999 --> 00:46.999
- No one's punched me in the
face or called me a bitch yet.

00:46.999 --> 00:47.999
- Well, that's good.

00:47.999 --> 00:50.999
- I have a booking in Italy
on Thursday.

00:50.999 --> 00:52.999
- In Italy?
- That's her profile picture

00:52.999 --> 00:53.999
on Instagram.

00:53.999 --> 00:54.999
She's not modeling.

00:54.999 --> 00:57.999
She Instagrams selfies
on yachts

00:57.999 --> 00:59.999
and probably giving
blowjobs.

- I want this one.

01:36.999 --> 01:38.999
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.999
- Welcome.
- Hi.

01:40.999 --> 01:42.999
- So, do you like
this style?

01:42.999 --> 01:44.999
- Yes, I love that style.

01:44.999 --> 01:45.999
- I just thought
it was so cute.

01:45.999 --> 01:46.999
- Yeah.
- But who's gonna try it on?

01:48.999 --> 01:51.999
Last year, I was focused
so much on opening Pump.

01:51.999 --> 01:53.999
It was my new baby.

01:53.999 --> 01:56.999
Why did I have to get old?
Why can't I wear that?

01:56.999 --> 01:58.999
But now, I'm back on the job
at Sur,

01:58.999 --> 02:02.999
and it's time to freshen up
with a new cocktail dress.

02:02.999 --> 02:04.999
You look like Minnie Mouse,
though.

02:04.999 --> 02:05.999
I think that
with ballet flats

02:05.999 --> 02:08.999
for, like, a party or something
is really sweet.

02:08.999 --> 02:10.999
Okay, can we take
six of these?

02:10.999 --> 02:12.999
And then we'll take, say,

02:12.999 --> 02:13.999
just four of those
for gay pride.

02:13.999 --> 02:15.999
- Okay.
- Anyway, I want to talk

02:15.999 --> 02:17.999
to you two.
I'm a bit cross with you.

02:17.999 --> 02:19.999
- What are you talking about?
- I know what you're doing

02:19.999 --> 02:21.999
with Lala.
You're trying to push her out.

02:21.999 --> 02:22.999
Don't be mean to her.
Don't exclude her.

02:22.999 --> 02:24.999
- I'm not mean--
I'm not mean at all.

02:24.999 --> 02:28.999
- I don't like this, kind of,
passive-aggressive treatment

02:28.999 --> 02:30.999
of the new girl.
I've seen it.

02:30.999 --> 02:32.999
- It's my table.
- And I took their drink order.

02:32.999 --> 02:34.000
- And then you stopped
right after.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.999
- Scheana should know better
than anybody

02:35.999 --> 02:37.999
because she was
a victim of that.

02:37.999 --> 02:39.000
- So what do you have to do
for that free trip?

02:39.999 --> 02:41.999
- I gotta keep my legs closed.
- But what about your mouth?

02:43.999 --> 02:44.999
- The girls are trying to push
Lala out

02:44.999 --> 02:46.999
because they've got it here.

02:46.999 --> 02:47.999
And they don't want
any competition.

02:47.999 --> 02:51.000
Especially somebody that's
5'8", 100 pounds, and blonde.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.999
- I just don't know
if she's someone that, like,

02:53.999 --> 02:55.999
I'm gonna have many things in
common with or get along with.

02:55.999 --> 02:59.999
- I'm not saying that you've got
to be friends with somebody.

02:59.999 --> 03:01.999
I'm saying don't be mean
to her.

03:01.999 --> 03:04.999
- Lala has been
misrepresenting herself,

03:04.999 --> 03:06.999
and Scheana and I
are the only ones

03:06.999 --> 03:08.999
that are actually
gonna bring it up to Lisa.

03:08.999 --> 03:09.999
- You know she's in Italy
right now.

03:09.999 --> 03:11.999
She's not working.
- Listen to me, she had a job.

03:11.999 --> 03:12.999
- No, she doesn't.
- She had a job for three days.

03:12.999 --> 03:14.999
- She's with some rich guy

03:14.999 --> 03:16.999
who's paying for her
to go on vacation.

03:16.999 --> 03:18.999
- But that's none
of your business.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.999
- There's no job.

03:20.999 --> 03:22.999
There's a rich dude
and a private jet.

03:22.999 --> 03:24.999
You're getting this trip
paid for for doing something.

03:24.999 --> 03:27.999
- I want you to welcome her.
I want you to include her.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.999
And I don't want her
to feel ostracized.

03:29.999 --> 03:30.999
I'm not gonna have it.
I'm not gonna have it.

03:45.999 --> 03:47.999
- What's up, guys?

03:47.999 --> 03:50.999
- We've all been doing this job
for not only a long time,

03:50.999 --> 03:52.999
but we've done a good job
doing it.

03:52.999 --> 03:55.999
For this resturant to be in
the top 100 whatever,

03:55.999 --> 03:56.999
it's not because we suck.
- Right.

03:56.999 --> 03:57.999
- And there's people here
that--

03:57.999 --> 03:59.999
we don't need to bring people
from down the street.

03:59.999 --> 04:00.999
I mean,
you're a good bartender, Peter.

04:00.999 --> 04:02.999
- I'm all about learning
a new cocktail.

04:02.999 --> 04:04.999
- Sure.
- Pump and Glory, whatever.

04:04.999 --> 04:06.999
That's fine.
- Hello.

04:06.999 --> 04:07.999
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:07.999 --> 04:09.999
- Hi, Lisa.
- How are you doing?

04:09.999 --> 04:11.999
- So, we're gonna learn
some new cocktails, right?

04:11.999 --> 04:15.999
I want the Pump-tini,
the Pump and Glory,

04:15.999 --> 04:17.999
all the ones that are
really popular in Pump.

04:17.999 --> 04:18.999
- Pump is Lisa's baby,

04:18.999 --> 04:22.999
and sometimes she tries
to make us feel inadequate.

04:22.999 --> 04:23.999
- Why do we got to bring someone
that's been with you for a year?

04:23.999 --> 04:25.999
- Because I make
that decision.

04:25.999 --> 04:29.999
- But in reality, me and Ariana
are two of the best bartenders

04:29.999 --> 04:30.999
that Lisa has.

04:30.999 --> 04:32.999
- I know you're not
the biggest fan of Eric,

04:32.999 --> 04:34.999
and I don't quite
understand why,

04:34.999 --> 04:38.999
but put that aside
and just do what I want, okay?

04:38.999 --> 04:40.999
Eric has worked for us
for a year now at Pump

04:40.999 --> 04:42.999
and done a brilliant job
as bar manager.

04:42.999 --> 04:43.999
And he's going to give you

04:43.999 --> 04:45.999
a f***ing education.
Get with it.

04:45.999 --> 04:46.999
Hello, Eric.
- How you doing, Lisa?

04:46.999 --> 04:48.999
- Good.
Hello, darling.

04:48.999 --> 04:51.999
- I brought our star bartender
with us.

04:51.999 --> 04:53.999
- We're here to make drinks,
and at some point,

04:53.999 --> 04:55.999
you will be
working together.

04:55.999 --> 04:56.999
Maybe if we're doing a party,

04:56.999 --> 04:57.999
maybe if I need you
down there...

04:57.999 --> 04:58.999
- No.
- You will be working

04:58.999 --> 05:01.999
underneath Eric.
- That's not happening.

05:01.999 --> 05:04.000
- You work
when we tell you to work.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.999
He's my right-hand man
in Pump, right?

05:06.999 --> 05:09.999
If you won't accept that,
you can leave

05:09.999 --> 05:11.999
and not work for me anymore.
- Okay.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.999
- If we talk
about pecking order

05:13.999 --> 05:16.999
and Eric's gonna get
beaten up by the big cock,

05:16.999 --> 05:18.999
then the real big cock's
gonna come in

05:18.999 --> 05:20.999
and peck the sh**
out of Jax.

05:20.999 --> 05:23.999
Go around the other side
of the bar.

05:23.999 --> 05:26.999
- There is one thing
that Eric does better than me.

05:26.999 --> 05:28.999
Kiss Lisa's ass.

05:28.999 --> 05:31.999
- The first cocktail
is gonna be the Pump-tini.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.000
I actually created
this cocktail myself.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.999
- Okay, big dick.
- That is so rude.

05:34.999 --> 05:36.999
- All right, let's do it.
- Do you see there? You--

05:36.999 --> 05:38.000
- I--all right,
make us some drinks.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.999
I'm sorry. Sometimes things
slip, I have to--

05:39.999 --> 05:41.999
- That's what your mother said.
It's cool.

05:41.999 --> 05:43.999
This was Jennifer Lawrence's
favorite cocktail

05:43.999 --> 05:45.999
when she came to Pump.
- That's true.

05:45.999 --> 05:47.999
- She comes here a lot, too.
She loves it here.

05:47.999 --> 05:49.999
- That was before Pump.
- So after today,

05:49.999 --> 05:51.999
you'll be able to give her
her favorite drink.

05:51.999 --> 05:53.999
- This is the Pump-tini.
Three raspberries,

05:53.999 --> 05:56.999
ounce and a half of vodka,
lime juice, simple syrup.

05:56.999 --> 05:58.999
This is our most popular
number one-selling cocktail.

05:58.999 --> 06:01.999
- I mean, that is sexy.
Look at that.

06:01.999 --> 06:03.999
- Did you build
the restaurant, too, or--

06:03.999 --> 06:05.999
- Again you're being an ass****.
- I'm asking if he built it.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.999
- No, but you're being
an ass****.

06:19.999 --> 06:21.999
Hello. Welcome back.
- Good to see you.

06:21.999 --> 06:23.999
- How's your little doggie?
- She's good.

06:23.999 --> 06:26.999
- Doggies always welcome.
You know me.

06:26.999 --> 06:29.999
More than humans, trust me.
See you later.

06:29.999 --> 06:32.999
- This table just ordered
a Pump and Glory.

06:32.999 --> 06:33.999
I didn't see that
on the menu.

06:33.999 --> 06:35.999
- Yeah, it's a drink from Pump.
- Oh, okay.

06:35.999 --> 06:37.999
- Yeah, we just learned
how to make them, so...

06:37.999 --> 06:39.999
- Oh, okay.
- Are you getting a U-Haul

06:39.999 --> 06:40.999
for tomorrow?
- I am.

06:40.999 --> 06:42.999
- What kind of couch
is it called again?

06:42.999 --> 06:43.999
- Sectional.
- Yeah.

06:43.999 --> 06:44.999
- I'm gonna carry it
on my shoulder.

06:44.999 --> 06:48.999
Like a real woman.
- Yeah.

06:48.999 --> 06:50.999
- Ooh.

06:50.999 --> 06:52.999
So, tomorrow,
you're gonna come to Pump

06:52.999 --> 06:54.000
just to work with
Richardson

06:54.999 --> 06:56.999
'cause I just want to make sure
that we're really on it

06:56.999 --> 06:57.999
with the service.

06:57.999 --> 06:59.999
It's just a refresher,
okay?

06:59.999 --> 07:01.999
I will see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

07:01.999 --> 07:04.999
- That's what I want
to hear.

07:04.999 --> 07:05.999
- Are you okay?

07:05.999 --> 07:06.999
- I'll talk you you
about it later.

07:06.999 --> 07:08.999
I don't want to get into it
right now

07:08.999 --> 07:10.999
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

07:10.999 --> 07:12.999
- Hey, Lala.
- Hi, Lisa.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.999
- How are you?
- Good.

07:14.999 --> 07:17.999
- How was the modeling?
- It's a long story.

07:17.999 --> 07:19.999
- Who was the photographer?

07:19.999 --> 07:22.999
Who were you modeling for?
Where was the location?

07:22.999 --> 07:24.999
Who booked it?
- Don't quiz me.

07:24.999 --> 07:26.999
- I'm allowed to quiz you.
If I employ you,

07:26.999 --> 07:27.999
I want to know
if you're telling me the truth.

07:27.999 --> 07:28.999
- You're right.
You're right.

07:28.999 --> 07:32.999
- You didn't really have
a modeling job though, did you?

07:32.999 --> 07:35.999
- This was somebody that I was
going to take pictures with

07:35.999 --> 07:40.999
in Venice and also maybe be
a little bit of arm candy.

07:40.999 --> 07:42.999
- I cannot start a relationship
off that's not an honest one.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
- I fully agree with you.
- Do you understand that?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.999
- Yes, absolutely.

07:46.999 --> 07:49.999
But I didn't go
because I needed to be at home.

07:49.999 --> 07:51.999
Like, literally I was
supposed to leave Thursday,

07:51.999 --> 07:54.999
and Thursday morning,
my mom flew me back home.

07:54.999 --> 07:56.999
- Why?
What happened?

07:56.999 --> 07:57.999
- I had a breakdown
and needed my mama,

07:57.999 --> 07:59.999
so I went home instead.

07:59.999 --> 08:01.999
- What do you mean,
seriously?

08:01.999 --> 08:03.999
- Just people saying things.

08:03.999 --> 08:05.999
I mean,
Scheana and Katie.

08:05.999 --> 08:08.999
I feel like when people are mean
and it's not warranted,

08:08.999 --> 08:10.999
I just needed my mama
for a little bit.

08:10.999 --> 08:12.999
My mom and I
are extremely close,

08:12.999 --> 08:15.999
so when I'm in
that headspace,

08:15.999 --> 08:18.999
the only thing I need
is my mom.

08:18.999 --> 08:19.999
- Well, that worries me.
- Don't--

08:19.999 --> 08:22.999
- You just--huh?
- Don't let it worry you.

08:22.999 --> 08:24.999
Like my mom said,
you make a commitment,

08:24.999 --> 08:28.999
you need to be there,
and put the problems aside.

08:28.999 --> 08:29.999
- I'll tell you
the way it goes.

08:29.999 --> 08:31.999
When these girls
ice somebody out,

08:31.999 --> 08:33.999
it actually has
the reverse effect

08:33.999 --> 08:36.999
because then the girl
gets my support.

08:36.999 --> 08:39.999
I'm concerned. I'm concerned
about what you've told me.

08:39.999 --> 08:41.999
Tonight,
before you're scheduled on,

08:41.999 --> 08:42.999
you need to have
a conversation with me.

08:42.999 --> 08:45.999
- Got it.
- Okay?

09:00.999 --> 09:03.999
- Scheana?

09:03.999 --> 09:05.999
Hey, Scheana.

09:05.999 --> 09:09.999
Scheana?

09:09.999 --> 09:13.999
- You have three tables left.
Yeah, yeah.

09:13.999 --> 09:16.999
- Scheana?
- I didn't even lock the door.

09:16.999 --> 09:18.999
- Oh, sorry.
I've been looking for you.

09:18.999 --> 09:20.999
- Sorry.
I just needed to get away.

09:20.999 --> 09:22.999
- What's going on?

09:22.999 --> 09:25.999
- Last night, Shay got drunk
out with his friends.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.999
His friend called me and said
he was really depressed

09:28.999 --> 09:30.999
and not doing so good,

09:30.999 --> 09:34.999
and that he hasn't
been home since.

09:34.999 --> 09:37.999
- So where is he now?
- At his parents' house.

09:37.999 --> 09:39.999
- Why has he not come home?

09:39.999 --> 09:42.999
- He's just not happy.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.999
And it's, like,
I can't even tell anymore

09:45.999 --> 09:48.999
if it's me
not making him happy,

09:48.999 --> 09:51.999
or, like...

09:51.999 --> 09:55.999
him just being unhappy
with himself.

09:55.999 --> 09:58.999
- I have to admit
I am completely shocked.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.999
I've never seen her
have any problems with Shay.

10:00.999 --> 10:03.999
- I was texting him all night,
and he wasn't responding.

10:03.999 --> 10:06.999
It's so hard
not having him at home.

10:06.999 --> 10:07.999
Like, I just want him there,
like,

10:07.999 --> 10:09.999
every minute of every day.

10:09.999 --> 10:12.000
I just, like, miss him.
I just want him to come home.

10:16.999 --> 10:17.999
- I've had a conversation
with Lala.

10:17.999 --> 10:19.999
- I'm going through
more important stuff

10:19.999 --> 10:20.999
than just being nice
to the new girl.

10:29.999 --> 10:30.999
♪ To be in love ♪

10:30.999 --> 10:33.999
♪ This feels so good ♪

10:33.999 --> 10:34.999
♪ I gotta have it ♪

10:34.999 --> 10:37.999
♪ Get my fill,
do what I will ♪

10:37.999 --> 10:41.999
♪ I don't care
as long as I feel lavish ♪

10:41.999 --> 10:46.000
- You're going home.
Good boy, give me a kiss.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Ken?
Take Hanky.

10:49.999 --> 10:51.999
He's been to the vet.
He's had a blood test.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.999
He's feeling okay,
but you gotta take him home.

10:53.999 --> 10:55.999
Hanky, my swan,
hasn't been well,

10:55.999 --> 10:57.999
and there's been a bit
of competition

10:57.999 --> 11:00.000
on the pond at Villa Rosa.

11:01.999 --> 11:03.000
You be nice to each other.

11:03.999 --> 11:04.999
And he's very depressed.

11:04.999 --> 11:06.000
Give me a kiss.
Stop it.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.999
Okay, take him home.

11:07.999 --> 11:10.999
I love all the animals
at my house.

11:10.999 --> 11:11.999
I'm passionate about them.

11:11.999 --> 11:15.999
And I love all the animals
that work for me at Sur as well.

11:15.999 --> 11:17.999
- I was waiting tables
before I could drive a car.

11:17.999 --> 11:19.999
- And now
we're getting trained.

11:19.999 --> 11:21.999
At least if we have to be
trained, it's--

11:21.999 --> 11:23.999
- By Richardson? Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:23.999 --> 11:25.999
- But whatever.
I'm just here for the eye candy.

11:25.999 --> 11:29.999
- Okay.
Hello, all of you.

11:29.999 --> 11:32.999
I bet you're looking forward
to this, not.

11:32.999 --> 11:35.999
- I mean, it's so stupid.

11:35.999 --> 11:38.999
I'm perfectly fine and have been
doing an amazing job at my job.

11:40.999 --> 11:43.999
- One of the things that
I often think a server forgets

11:43.999 --> 11:46.999
is to be sensitive
to the conversation

11:47.000 --> 11:48.999
that our customers
are having.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.999
- And the other thing is, now,
you take the order,

11:51.999 --> 11:53.999
you talk to them,
show your personality.

11:53.999 --> 11:55.999
Be like--be alive.
Be with the table.

11:55.999 --> 11:56.999
Like Lisa says.

11:56.999 --> 11:58.999
- Richardson is
my main man.

11:58.999 --> 12:01.999
He's worked for us
at Villa Blanca for years now.

12:01.999 --> 12:04.999
He's a butt-kicking,
ass-whipping kind of guy.

12:04.999 --> 12:07.999
And he's gonna lick these guys
into shape.

12:07.999 --> 12:08.999
Hopefully not literally.

12:08.999 --> 12:10.999
- When you get to the table,
you offer them the water,

12:10.999 --> 12:11.999
but very important
to upsell.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.999
- But always say,
"Would you like sparkling?

12:13.999 --> 12:14.999
Would you like flat?"
- Or still, yeah.

12:14.999 --> 12:16.999
- Try to use
elevative language,

12:16.999 --> 12:18.999
and you kind of
drive the table, especially--

12:18.999 --> 12:20.999
- And never bring your stress
back to the table.

12:20.999 --> 12:21.999
- Ever.
- It can be falling apart

12:21.999 --> 12:23.999
back there.
- Yeah.

12:23.999 --> 12:25.999
- I don't like people
to see me cry.

12:25.999 --> 12:26.999
I try and always
hold it together

12:26.999 --> 12:28.999
and put on a happy face,

12:28.999 --> 12:31.999
but I can't get through
a couple of sentences

12:31.999 --> 12:34.999
without think about
Shay being gone and crying.

12:34.999 --> 12:37.999
- Remember, front of house,
all is calm.

12:37.999 --> 12:40.999
- Katie, do you have
any news to tell us?

12:40.999 --> 12:41.999
I'm joking,
I'm joking.

12:41.999 --> 12:42.999
- Yeah, I'm pregnant.

12:42.999 --> 12:45.999
- Yes.
- Oh, I would love that.

12:45.999 --> 12:46.999
- You know what, Katie?
You know what?

12:46.999 --> 12:48.999
If Schwartz is not trying
to give you one,

12:48.999 --> 12:49.999
there's a lot of other people
out there

12:49.999 --> 12:50.999
who might want to
give you one, okay?

12:50.999 --> 12:52.999
- Are you offering?
- Oh!

12:52.999 --> 12:54.999
- I would--hey,
I'm in the market to be a dad.

12:54.999 --> 12:56.999
I'm just saying.
- Oh!

12:56.999 --> 12:57.999
- Are you serious?

12:57.999 --> 12:59.999
- Part of me wants to
tell Richardson

12:59.999 --> 13:01.999
to pump the brakes
on that whole thing,

13:01.999 --> 13:03.999
but then the other part
is, like,

13:03.999 --> 13:04.999
"Well, maybe we'll talk
in six months

13:04.999 --> 13:06.999
if I don't have a ring
on my finger."

13:17.999 --> 13:19.999
- Oh, here's your model.
- Hey. What's going on, guys?

13:19.999 --> 13:21.999
- This is Todd, this is Melissa.
- Hey, nice to meet you.

13:21.999 --> 13:22.999
- Nice to meet you.
- This is Michelle.

13:22.999 --> 13:24.999
- Hi, Michelle.
Pleasure to meet you.

13:24.999 --> 13:26.999
- They're the two lovely girls
shooting with you today.

13:26.999 --> 13:27.999
- Wow, wow, wow.

13:27.999 --> 13:28.999
- So we're going to do
the cover try.

13:28.999 --> 13:30.999
- Yeah, thanks for having me,
by the way.

13:30.999 --> 13:31.999
Good to see you again.
- Yep.

13:31.999 --> 13:32.999
So we're going to do
the cover try

13:32.999 --> 13:35.999
and get a few shots in
for the editorial.

13:35.999 --> 13:37.000
- Okay, what is the d--
I mean, I know what it is,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.999
but what's the definition
of a cover--

13:39.999 --> 13:43.999
- Cover try.
- Okay, that's--you know, I--

13:43.999 --> 13:46.999
- He's a model, a male model.
- That's okay.

13:46.999 --> 13:48.999
- Meagan will show you
where to go.

13:48.999 --> 13:49.999
- Okay, cool.
- The girls are going to change,

13:49.999 --> 13:52.000
so you guys head back there.
- Nice to meet you guys.

13:54.999 --> 13:56.999
Modeling's always been
inconsistent,

13:56.999 --> 13:58.999
streaky at best for me.

13:58.999 --> 14:01.999
- Beautiful.
That's nice.

14:01.999 --> 14:04.999
- However, lately I've had
a nice few scores...

14:07.999 --> 14:09.999
Which is really clutch
because I'm trying

14:09.999 --> 14:11.999
to save some money for
something big.

14:14.999 --> 14:16.999
- There we go.

14:16.999 --> 14:17.999
Okay, next girl.

14:17.999 --> 14:21.999
- I'm a professional.
I'm a consummate professional.

14:21.999 --> 14:23.999
- Ha-ha.
Good job, Michelle.

14:23.999 --> 14:25.999
- But, uh, let's be honest.
Getting to work with

14:25.999 --> 14:30.999
beautiful women
isn't the worst job perk.

14:30.999 --> 14:31.999
- She's wearing white.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.999
Would you prefer
a wedding dress on her?

14:33.999 --> 14:34.999
- Hey, slow down.

14:34.999 --> 14:35.999
- It's like
the best job ever.

14:35.999 --> 14:39.999
However, as hard as it is
for me to say that I've grown,

14:39.999 --> 14:41.999
I have grown,
and so has Katie,

14:41.999 --> 14:45.999
and we've blossomed
into TomKat once again.

14:45.999 --> 14:47.999
It's a good color
for you.

14:47.999 --> 14:49.999
- All right, quit flirting.
No more flirting.

14:49.999 --> 14:52.999
Well, I guess you can
before you get engaged, huh?

14:53.999 --> 14:55.999
- He's supposed to--
- Well--

14:55.999 --> 14:57.999
- He's saving up for that ring.
- Revenue comes--'cause, yeah.

14:57.999 --> 15:00.999
I'm staring down the barrel
of the rest of my life,

15:00.999 --> 15:02.999
and there's a price tag
dangling,

15:02.999 --> 15:05.999
and I can't quite
make out what that number is,

15:05.999 --> 15:07.999
but it's f***ing huge.

15:07.999 --> 15:08.999
- Has she been waiting for this
for a long time?

15:08.999 --> 15:10.000
- Yeah, that's the thing.

15:10.999 --> 15:11.999
So I don't want to make it
too gimmicky or anything.

15:11.999 --> 15:13.999
- You want it to be, like,
unexpected...

15:13.999 --> 15:14.999
- Yeah.
- Where she's, like, "What?"

15:14.999 --> 15:16.000
- Oh, no, she's--yeah,
that's the most important thing.

15:16.999 --> 15:17.999
- But at the same time, you have
to let her know that, like,

15:17.999 --> 15:19.999
something good's gonna happen,
so she can be, like,

15:19.999 --> 15:21.999
hair and makeup ready.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:21.999 --> 15:22.999
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, that's a good point.

15:22.999 --> 15:24.999
- Yeah, 'cause every girl's
gonna want to make sure, yeah.

15:24.999 --> 15:26.999
- I'm writing this down.
This is good.

15:26.999 --> 15:28.999
I've sort of been relishing
in the fact

15:28.999 --> 15:30.999
that I am just now ready
to propose.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.999
- Little closer to--nice.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.999
- I feel like it's a triumph
in itself

15:34.999 --> 15:36.999
and I haven't even
begun to think about

15:36.999 --> 15:38.999
the actual process
of getting a ring.

15:38.999 --> 15:40.999
- One more.
Got it.

15:40.999 --> 15:42.999
- Awesome. Good job.
- That's a wrap.

15:42.999 --> 15:45.999
- Sh**.
Sh**'s becoming real.

15:45.999 --> 15:46.999
Thank you.

15:54.999 --> 15:58.999
- Oh, the f***ing ground's
boiling.

15:58.999 --> 16:01.999
Thank you, beautiful.
- Careful, it's glass.

16:01.999 --> 16:02.999
- Okay.
- It'll break.

16:02.999 --> 16:05.999
- Cheers.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.999
I really just treat it as
a blessing now I'm here with you

16:08.999 --> 16:10.999
and we get to have this,
like, moment, you know?

16:10.999 --> 16:12.999
- Thank you.
- And not fight for once.

16:12.999 --> 16:13.999
'Cause when we're not fighting,
Kristen,

16:13.999 --> 16:16.999
I'm honestly the happiest guy
ever, I really am.

16:16.999 --> 16:18.999
I feel bad about lying
to Kristen,

16:18.999 --> 16:22.999
but at the same time, I had,
like, good sex with Jenna.

16:22.999 --> 16:24.999
I don't regret
what happened with her,

16:24.999 --> 16:26.000
but I love Kristen,
don't get me wrong.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
- Yeah.
- But then there's times where

16:27.000 --> 16:28.999
we have one bad week,

16:28.999 --> 16:30.000
and then that week
falls onto another predicament

16:30.999 --> 16:31.999
that overloads
the whole other times.

16:31.999 --> 16:33.999
- 'Cause I feel like
when we have an issue,

16:33.999 --> 16:34.999
we don't necessarily,
like,

16:34.999 --> 16:37.999
fix the original problem
completely,

16:37.999 --> 16:40.999
so then it kind of
is still there underneath,

16:40.999 --> 16:41.999
and then it keeps going.
- Yeah.

16:41.999 --> 16:42.999
Yeah, I'm been thinking
more about that as well.

16:42.999 --> 16:45.999
- I feel like insecurities
stem from--

16:45.999 --> 16:48.999
because you've been
unfaithful, and so then--

16:48.999 --> 16:50.000
- I mean,
but I've never had sex--

16:50.999 --> 16:51.999
I've never, like,
had sex with somebody else.

16:51.999 --> 16:53.999
- That I would, though.
- Like, I haven't slept

16:53.999 --> 16:54.999
with anybody else.
- I know that.

16:54.999 --> 16:56.999
Do you think that's
a possibility of the, like,

16:56.999 --> 17:00.999
you--that that's why
you're insecure?

17:00.999 --> 17:02.999
- Yeah, but it's not that.
It's the fact that

17:02.999 --> 17:04.999
I don't trust you.
Sorry.

17:04.999 --> 17:06.999
- Well, slow your roll there
a little bit.

17:06.999 --> 17:07.999
- Okay.
Example.

17:07.999 --> 17:09.999
The other day we were having
a hard week, okay?

17:09.999 --> 17:12.999
So then, just to top it off,
you had, like,

17:12.999 --> 17:14.999
you've had the first lunch
with Jax you've had in a year.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.999
- You need to end this
with James.

17:16.999 --> 17:18.000
- It's not okay that he cheated
on me, like, it's not.

17:18.999 --> 17:19.999
- How do you allow somebody
to, like, cheat on you

17:19.999 --> 17:21.999
and just go back?

17:21.999 --> 17:24.999
- Then that could really be
a huge part of,

17:24.999 --> 17:26.999
you know, my insecurities,
Kristen.

17:26.999 --> 17:28.999
- I get why James
is so insecure.

17:28.999 --> 17:30.999
It's a classic
cheater move.

17:30.999 --> 17:31.999
You blame the other person

17:31.999 --> 17:33.999
because you're the one
f***ing up.

17:33.999 --> 17:35.999
- Quite frankly, I should--
no guy should trust him

17:35.999 --> 17:38.999
around any girls, okay?
'Cause it's f***ing Jax.

17:38.999 --> 17:41.999
He's got no soul.

17:48.999 --> 17:50.999
- I need to--
I left my phone.

17:50.999 --> 17:52.999
- Whether or not
the new hostess feels welcome.

17:52.999 --> 17:54.999
I'm sorry, but she also
lied to my face.

17:54.999 --> 17:56.999
Like, not really exactly
trying to, you know--

17:56.999 --> 17:58.999
Hi.
- Take a breath.

17:58.999 --> 18:00.999
- I've--
- Okay, I don't expect to put

18:00.999 --> 18:02.999
200 people together
in a company

18:02.999 --> 18:03.999
and expect them to all get on.
- Sure.

18:03.999 --> 18:07.999
- But I've had a conversation
with Lala.

18:07.999 --> 18:10.999
And she's having a hard time,
I see that very clearly.

18:10.999 --> 18:12.999
So let's be kind.
- I've never been mean.

18:12.999 --> 18:14.999
- She's obviously
a little fragile.

18:14.999 --> 18:17.999
- Clearly you like her,
so obviously there's something

18:17.999 --> 18:18.999
in her that we should
probably like.

18:18.999 --> 18:20.999
- I'm just saying you remember
what it's like

18:20.999 --> 18:22.999
to be the new girl.
- I'm not trying to bully her.

18:22.999 --> 18:24.999
I just--I have other things
going on

18:24.999 --> 18:26.999
that are taking precedence
in my life right now.

18:26.999 --> 18:28.999
- Okay, I understand that,
but let's not minimize

18:28.999 --> 18:30.999
her feelings.
Do you understand that?

18:30.999 --> 18:31.999
And I know
you're both sensitive.

18:31.999 --> 18:33.999
- I'm having a hard time
with my life, Lisa.

18:33.999 --> 18:35.999
I feel like I'm going
through more important stuff

18:35.999 --> 18:36.999
than just being nice
to the new girl.

18:36.999 --> 18:38.999
- Okay, all right. Okay.
- I'm sorry.

18:38.999 --> 18:41.999
I probably am a little bitchy
these days, but with Lala,

18:41.999 --> 18:43.999
how about we have tea
after I save my marriage?

18:43.999 --> 18:44.999
Is that okay?

18:44.999 --> 18:45.999
I will talk to her.
I will apologize.

18:45.999 --> 18:46.999
- All right.

18:46.999 --> 18:48.999
- I just have other things
going on right now.

18:48.999 --> 18:49.999
- I'm just saying
she's going through a lot.

18:49.999 --> 18:50.999
- So am I,
and what I'm going through,

18:50.999 --> 18:52.999
I guarantee is bigger.
- I know you are, darling.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.999
- I've been single
for three years now.

18:57.999 --> 18:58.999
- Usually I'd meet a girl,
within ten minutes

18:58.999 --> 18:59.999
she's my girlfriend.

18:59.999 --> 19:01.999
- You and I would
definitely click then.

19:16.999 --> 19:19.999
- Yo. Come, creeper.

19:19.999 --> 19:21.999
- What's going on here?
- Not much.

19:21.999 --> 19:24.999
- Strumming on your guitar?
- Strumming on the guitar.

19:24.999 --> 19:25.999
- I could hear you
from the street.

19:25.999 --> 19:26.999
- Yeah.
- Are we helping her

19:26.999 --> 19:28.999
just load it or what?
- Yeah.

19:28.999 --> 19:31.000
All right, so...
- This old thing?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
This couch is--
- What do you mean?

19:33.999 --> 19:34.999
- It's seen some sh**.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.000
We should put that thing
in a museum.

19:36.999 --> 19:38.999
Let me tell you, you turn on
a black light on that thing,

19:38.999 --> 19:40.999
you're looking at
a Jackson Pollock.

19:40.999 --> 19:42.000
Should we get, like,
some gloves or something?

19:42.999 --> 19:44.999
- Faith doesn't need to know
some things that have

19:44.999 --> 19:45.999
transpired on this couch.
- Here.

19:45.999 --> 19:46.999
- Watch your step.
- I'm good.

19:46.999 --> 19:48.999
Two Toms, one couch.
- That's right.

19:48.999 --> 19:51.999
This couch has a lot of stories,
but it's not the couch

19:51.999 --> 19:54.000
that Jax and Kristen
slept together on.

19:54.999 --> 19:55.999
That couch
is in my living room.

19:55.999 --> 19:58.999
But this couch also has
some character

19:58.999 --> 19:59.999
between the threads.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.999
- Dude, we should have put this
out here a long time ago.

20:02.999 --> 20:03.999
I had a good photo shoot.
- Yeah?

20:03.999 --> 20:05.999
- Yeah, it was pretty good.
I'm trying to make as much

20:05.999 --> 20:07.999
extra money as possible
before the you-know-what.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.999
- Yeah, of course.
- Which is coming up very soon.

20:09.999 --> 20:12.999
I think I'm gonna go platinum
and white gold for the ring.

20:12.999 --> 20:14.999
- It would look so badass.
- Yeah. Will you come?

20:14.999 --> 20:16.999
- Yeah, of course, dude.
- Thank you, bro.

20:16.999 --> 20:17.999
I asked Scheana to come,
too,

20:17.999 --> 20:18.999
just to get
a little women's perspective.

20:18.999 --> 20:19.999
- Yeah, definitely.
- You know,

20:19.999 --> 20:21.999
I thought that'd be nice.

20:21.999 --> 20:24.999
- I think Schwartz is starting
to find his inner zen.

20:24.999 --> 20:28.999
There is a calmness about him
when it comes to commitment

20:28.999 --> 20:30.999
that I haven't seen
in him ever.

20:30.999 --> 20:32.999
I heard from Ariana that,
you know,

20:32.999 --> 20:34.999
Shay's been, like, drinking
a lot and stuff like that.

20:34.999 --> 20:37.999
- Maui.
Beach and Maui!

20:37.999 --> 20:40.999
- I know. We're doing that for
your five-year, right?

20:40.999 --> 20:41.999
- I don't know any details,

20:41.999 --> 20:42.999
but is he going
through some sh**?

20:42.999 --> 20:45.999
- I don't know, maybe.
I'd like to

20:45.999 --> 20:47.999
talk to him and see
what's going on, you know?

20:47.999 --> 20:49.999
- Yeah, I haven't been
communicating with Shay lately.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.999
- The fact that Shay
just randomly took off

20:51.999 --> 20:53.999
because he was fed up
and went back to Azusa

20:53.999 --> 20:56.999
really concerns me because
from everything I've known,

20:56.999 --> 20:58.999
their relationship
has been amazing.

20:58.999 --> 21:00.999
- What up?

21:00.999 --> 21:02.999
- What up?
- Hey.

21:02.999 --> 21:05.999
That's a big-ass U-Haul.
- That is a big-ass U-Haul.

21:05.999 --> 21:08.999
- There's definitely a lineage
of things

21:08.999 --> 21:10.999
that get passed down
in the Sur family.

21:10.999 --> 21:13.999
There's apartments
that get passed down.

21:13.999 --> 21:16.999
There's furniture.
There's clothing.

21:16.999 --> 21:18.999
People that get passed down.

21:18.999 --> 21:20.999
It's sort of ritualistic
in a way.

21:20.999 --> 21:21.999
- One, two, three.
- Oh, you know.

21:21.999 --> 21:23.999
Just--just chilling.
- We got you.

21:23.999 --> 21:25.999
- Don't worry too much, boys.
- Geez.

21:25.999 --> 21:27.999
- You know,
carrying a queen here.

21:27.999 --> 21:30.999
Thank you so much.
Man, I'm so excited

21:30.999 --> 21:32.999
to sleep on this thing, and...
- Of course.

21:32.999 --> 21:35.999
- Maybe a little once over
with the steam cleaner.

21:35.999 --> 21:37.999
- Once over with--
- Or maybe, like, a scraper.

21:37.999 --> 21:39.999
You know, like something you'd
use to get ice off a window.

21:39.999 --> 21:40.999
You know what I'm saying,
though?

21:40.999 --> 21:42.000
- I don't know what
he's talking about.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.999
- Think about it.
- Ice pick on the couch.

21:43.999 --> 21:45.999
- Dried semen.
- That's pretty nasty.

21:45.999 --> 21:46.999
- Anyways, I'm just messing
with you.

21:46.999 --> 21:48.999
It's a good, clean couch.
Give me a hug.

21:48.999 --> 21:49.999
- I will. All right.
- And sorry that we're too--

21:49.999 --> 21:52.999
Oh, my God, you're strong!
Holy sh**.

21:52.999 --> 21:53.999
- I'll see you.
- I think you just

21:53.999 --> 21:54.999
mandhandled me.
- I won't do that to you.

21:54.999 --> 21:56.999
- All right, bye, Faith.
- I'll see you guys.

21:56.999 --> 21:57.999
- Bye, Faith. Be careful.
- Keep the Faith.

21:57.999 --> 21:59.999
- Bye, Faith.
- All right, bye, guys.

21:59.999 --> 22:00.999
- See ya.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.999
- Hey.
- Well, hi, friend.

22:14.999 --> 22:16.999
- Are you on a break?
- Yeah.

22:16.999 --> 22:18.999
- Here, let me pull up
a chair for you.

22:18.999 --> 22:21.999
- You're such a gentleman.
- I've been told.

22:21.999 --> 22:24.999
- Thank you.
- What's going on?

22:24.999 --> 22:26.999
- Just hanging out.

22:26.999 --> 22:28.999
- So how are you
liking Sur so far?

22:28.999 --> 22:29.999
- Um, I like it.

22:29.999 --> 22:31.999
- I guess
the bigger question is,

22:31.999 --> 22:34.999
how are the girls
treating you here?

22:34.999 --> 22:35.999
Ah, you can be honest
with me.

22:35.999 --> 22:38.999
I don't gossip.

22:38.999 --> 22:40.999
- You're so full
of bullsh**.

22:40.999 --> 22:42.999
- I can't even say that
with a straight face.

22:42.999 --> 22:45.999
- I don't know Jax very well,
but from what I've heard,

22:45.999 --> 22:48.999
he gets around.
You get Jax'ed.

22:48.999 --> 22:51.000
I don't know what it means,
but it sounds fun.

22:51.999 --> 22:53.999
I totally feel
like I'm in junior high school,

22:53.999 --> 22:56.999
about, like, who you should
be friends with

22:56.999 --> 22:57.999
and who you shouldn't be
friends with,

22:57.999 --> 22:59.999
and, like,
what is this?

22:59.999 --> 23:01.999
Are we recruiting for dodgeball
in sixth grade?

23:01.999 --> 23:02.999
Like, I'm--
- First of all, welcome to Sur.

23:02.999 --> 23:04.999
That's exactly what this is.
- Okay.

23:04.999 --> 23:06.999
- This is a very cliquey,
cliquey,

23:06.999 --> 23:09.999
super-cliquey restaurant.

23:09.999 --> 23:11.999
This place is not
an easy place to work.

23:11.999 --> 23:12.999
- No.
I've noticed that.

23:12.999 --> 23:13.999
- I mean, we should have
a plaque

23:13.999 --> 23:15.999
of the girls that came in here
and gone

23:15.999 --> 23:16.999
'cause they couldn't
hack it

23:16.999 --> 23:18.999
because these girls
are such bullies.

23:18.999 --> 23:20.999
We've had girls--no, and I'm not
stretching the truth at all,

23:20.999 --> 23:21.999
that were so excited
to work here

23:21.999 --> 23:24.999
last maybe two or three hours
and cry and run.

23:24.999 --> 23:26.999
- I am a girl's girl.

23:26.999 --> 23:29.999
I would much rather hang out
with a group of girls than guys.

23:29.999 --> 23:33.999
But since Katie and Scheana
have completely iced me out,

23:33.999 --> 23:35.999
I don't really see
any other choice

23:35.999 --> 23:37.999
but to make friends
with the men.

23:37.999 --> 23:39.999
So how's this girlfriend
of yours?

23:39.999 --> 23:41.999
- Let's easy with that word
"girlfriend."

23:41.999 --> 23:42.999
Chill on that.
Pump the brakes.

23:42.999 --> 23:44.999
- Pump the brakes on
"girlfriend"?

23:44.999 --> 23:45.999
- Pump the brakes on that word.
That's a scary word for me.

23:45.999 --> 23:46.999
Are we dating? Absolutely.
- Yeah.

23:46.999 --> 23:48.999
- Would I call her
"girlfriend" yet? No.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.999
I would like
to be exclusive.

23:51.999 --> 23:52.999
- You're not gonna meet
another girl, you promise?

23:52.999 --> 23:54.999
- Another girl--I promise.
I love this.

23:54.999 --> 23:56.999
Normally, yes.
I usually--I meet a girl,

23:56.999 --> 23:57.999
within ten minutes,
she's my girlfriend.

23:57.999 --> 23:58.999
Like, I--
- You and I would definitely

23:58.999 --> 24:00.999
click then.

24:01.999 --> 24:04.999
When it comes to Lala,
I kind of see a few red flags.

24:04.999 --> 24:08.999
She's young, she's blonde,
she's trouble.

24:08.999 --> 24:09.999
- Hello, I've been single
for three years now.

24:09.999 --> 24:10.999
- Three years?
- Basically not working--

24:10.999 --> 24:12.999
yeah, I'm so--
- You just choose to be single?

24:12.999 --> 24:14.999
Or are you just dating--
- I'm just hooked on my ex.

24:14.999 --> 24:16.999
- There's plenty of fish
in the sea, so, you know.

24:16.999 --> 24:18.999
- Amen, brother.
- Right? Right?

24:18.999 --> 24:19.999
- Yep.
- It's not like there's

24:19.999 --> 24:22.999
a shortage of men,
so if you need any help,

24:22.999 --> 24:24.999
you know, you're--
I'm friendly.

24:24.999 --> 24:26.999
- You seem friendly.
- I'm a nice guy.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.000
- Yeah, I like it.

24:28.999 --> 24:29.999
- And I gotta get back
to work.

24:29.999 --> 24:30.999
- Yep.
- All right, good luck.

24:30.999 --> 24:34.999
- All right.
Bye, suge.

24:47.999 --> 24:48.999
- Hello?
- Hi.

24:48.999 --> 24:50.999
- I just came in the door.
- Oh, yeah.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.999
I left it open for you.
- I could have been a rapist

24:53.999 --> 24:55.999
or a murderer.
- I take my chances.

24:55.999 --> 24:57.999
- It's not. It was me.
- I've been meaning to do

24:57.999 --> 25:01.999
these things for weeks.
- Do you need help?

25:01.999 --> 25:03.999
- This is too difficult
right now.

25:03.999 --> 25:05.999
- Okay.

25:05.999 --> 25:07.999
I like that these guys
are hanging out.

25:07.999 --> 25:08.999
- I know, right?
- And that these guys are,

25:08.999 --> 25:10.999
like, BFFs.
- Yeah.

25:10.999 --> 25:12.999
- Love Frog loves having
a new friend.

25:12.999 --> 25:14.999
- So the server training
was fun?

25:14.999 --> 25:16.999
- Well, it was actually more

25:16.999 --> 25:18.999
just like
an informative meeting.

25:18.999 --> 25:21.999
- Mm-hmm.
- But then Lala's there.

25:21.999 --> 25:22.999
It's, like,
clear there's tension.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.999
I'm just, like,
"Dude, I...

25:24.999 --> 25:27.999
seriously do not have the energy
for this right now."

25:27.999 --> 25:28.999
- No, thanks.
No, thank you.

25:28.999 --> 25:30.999
- Like, everything, like--
I mean, I haven't really

25:30.999 --> 25:32.999
told you too much because
I've just been trying to, like,

25:32.999 --> 25:34.999
keep putting on
my happy face

25:34.999 --> 25:38.999
and just pretend like
everything's okay.

25:38.999 --> 25:41.999
Everyone, like, looks at us
as the perfect, happy couple,

25:41.999 --> 25:45.999
and I'm like, "But there are,
like, issues."

25:45.999 --> 25:47.999
Now I'm kind of
understanding

25:47.999 --> 25:50.999
all of Schwartz's, like,
reservations with all of this.

25:50.999 --> 25:52.999
And I'm going, like,
engagement ring shopping

25:52.999 --> 25:56.999
with him on Saturday,
and I'm like,

25:56.999 --> 25:59.999
"This is awesome. Don't do it."

25:59.999 --> 26:00.999
- Oh, God.
I'm sorry.

26:00.999 --> 26:03.999
- I just--I'm just
so f***ing confused with, like,

26:03.999 --> 26:06.999
everything right now
'cause it's just, like--

26:06.999 --> 26:09.999
just with Shay lately,
I just feel like

26:09.999 --> 26:11.999
my partner in all of this
is just so not happy.

26:11.999 --> 26:14.999
Like, it just breaks
my heart and it's just, like,

26:14.999 --> 26:16.999
he's just been drinking,
like, so much lately.

26:16.999 --> 26:19.999
Just, like,
self-medicating.

26:19.999 --> 26:24.999
Clearly, like, this is not
making him happy right now.

26:24.999 --> 26:25.999
- I didn't know that you were
going through a lot of this.

26:25.999 --> 26:28.999
- 'Cause I just, like,
keep trying to be happy,

26:28.999 --> 26:30.999
but I don't want to, like,
just, like, start, like,

26:30.999 --> 26:31.999
bringing everyone down
with me.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.999
Like, I just want to stay strong
and just be happy.

26:34.999 --> 26:36.999
- Scheana and I have been
seeing less

26:36.999 --> 26:38.999
of each other recently
because of Kristen.

26:38.999 --> 26:41.999
So I haven't really heard
anything that's been going on

26:41.999 --> 26:43.999
between her and Shay.

26:43.999 --> 26:46.999
She always acts like
everything is perfect,

26:46.999 --> 26:49.999
and that makes me
really worried for her.

26:49.999 --> 26:50.999
I mean, I feel like--
- I don't like to burden.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.999
I know that's what
friends are here for.

26:52.999 --> 26:53.999
Like, to talk about
this sh** with...

26:53.999 --> 26:55.999
- You're not burdening me
at all.

26:55.999 --> 26:57.999
- But I just feel like
the last couple of days, like...

26:57.999 --> 26:59.999
- I'll f***ing stay here.
- It's so f***ing lonely here.

26:59.999 --> 27:01.999
- I'll, like, move in here.
- Like, there's just, like,

27:01.999 --> 27:02.999
f***ing wedding pictures
of us everywhere,

27:02.999 --> 27:05.999
and I just, like...
- I know.

27:05.999 --> 27:06.999
- Did we rush this?

27:06.999 --> 27:09.999
Like, should we have waited
a little longer?

27:09.999 --> 27:10.999
- I f***ing get that sh**.

27:10.999 --> 27:13.999
- I'm just so f***ing confused
right now.

27:13.999 --> 27:14.999
I don't know why
I f***ing put eyelashes on

27:15.000 --> 27:16.999
for that meeting earlier.

27:16.999 --> 27:18.999
I mean,
have I been, like,

27:18.999 --> 27:19.999
not an attentive wife?

27:19.999 --> 27:22.999
Have I not been, like,
paying attention to signs?

27:22.999 --> 27:24.999
Like, have I been ignoring
things because I'm happy

27:24.999 --> 27:26.999
and not knowing
that he's not?

27:26.999 --> 27:27.999
Like, and then now,
of course,

27:28.000 --> 27:29.999
it's like I just put this
all on myself.

27:29.999 --> 27:30.999
And I'm like,
"It's my fault.

27:30.999 --> 27:32.999
"I wasn't there for him.
I was enabling him.

27:32.999 --> 27:34.999
"I'm--I'm being this
annoying mother

27:34.999 --> 27:35.999
and not, like,
an amazing wife."

27:35.999 --> 27:37.999
And, like, I just, like--
I feel like

27:37.999 --> 27:40.999
I'm just literally questioning,
like, everything right now.

27:40.999 --> 27:42.999
I don't want
to hide things,

27:42.999 --> 27:46.999
but there are some things
that are just kept private

27:46.999 --> 27:48.000
between Shay and I,

27:48.000 --> 27:49.999
and there are a lot of things
I haven't shared.

27:49.999 --> 27:51.999
There's just a lot more
to this story

27:51.999 --> 27:53.999
that everyone doesn't know.

27:53.999 --> 27:55.999
You guys were at my wedding,
you saw that.

27:55.999 --> 27:56.999
It was perfect.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.999
It just, like--
it makes me, like,

27:58.999 --> 28:01.999
so sad to think like,
"Was this too good to be true?"

28:01.999 --> 28:03.999
Like, do I not deserve
to be happy?

28:03.999 --> 28:07.999
Like, what if this doesn't
work out?

28:13.999 --> 28:15.999
I feel like
I've been cheated on.

28:15.999 --> 28:17.999
Like, you have this whole other
life that I never knew of.

28:17.999 --> 28:19.999
- Is he the man
that you thought he was?

28:37.999 --> 28:39.999
- Here's a cocktail menu
for you guys

28:39.999 --> 28:42.999
if you want to
check that out.

28:42.999 --> 28:44.999
- So no glasses.
- Hey, hello.

28:44.999 --> 28:45.999
Hey, James, how are you?
- Hi, Lisa, how are you?

28:45.999 --> 28:48.999
I heard the swans are sick.
I was talking to Max.

28:48.999 --> 28:49.999
You had to take them to the vet.
- Yeah, Hanky.

28:49.999 --> 28:51.999
Yeah, one of mine.
You've met him, I know.

28:51.999 --> 28:52.999
- Aww, I know, poor thing.
- He's not good.

28:52.999 --> 28:55.999
I had to take him to the vet
and he's still not good.

28:55.999 --> 28:57.999
Maybe I'll get some
antibiotics from Jax.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.999
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, things--

29:01.999 --> 29:02.999
they're all right with me.

29:02.999 --> 29:04.999
I mean,
not so much with Kristen.

29:04.999 --> 29:05.999
- What do you mean?
- It's really just

29:05.999 --> 29:07.999
taking a toll.
We're just in a bad patch.

29:07.999 --> 29:10.999
- I'm sorry about that.
- Thank you.

29:10.999 --> 29:13.999
- James needs Kristen
in his life right now

29:13.999 --> 29:15.999
like he needs
a boil on his ass.

29:15.999 --> 29:17.999
Now you behave yourself.

29:17.999 --> 29:18.999
- I've been behaving myself.

29:18.999 --> 29:21.999
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Somewhat.

29:21.999 --> 29:24.999
- I think you need to
rely on somebody

29:24.999 --> 29:27.999
that's emotionally supportive.

29:27.999 --> 29:28.999
- I'm done! Walk!
- Look what you did.

29:28.999 --> 29:30.999
Look what you did.
- Walk! Walk!

29:30.999 --> 29:32.999
- f*** you!
- Fine! f*** me! Walk!

29:32.999 --> 29:35.999
- And I don't look at Kristen
as being that person.

29:35.999 --> 29:36.999
Sorry to hear about that.

29:36.999 --> 29:39.999
It's just that right now,
what with

29:39.999 --> 29:42.999
Lala and Hanky, and ugh.
- Yeah, I know.

29:42.999 --> 29:43.999
It's all crazy town in there.
- Just, like,

29:43.999 --> 29:46.999
you need to take your mind
of your--hey.

29:46.999 --> 29:47.999
- Hey.
- I'm not even going to ask

29:48.000 --> 29:49.999
how you are.
Just tell me you're fine.

29:49.999 --> 29:51.999
- I'm excellent.
- Okay, good.

29:51.999 --> 29:54.999
That's all I need to hear.
Thank you for that, Katie.

29:54.999 --> 29:59.999
Oh, God, it's just like
I'm riddled with problems here.

30:04.999 --> 30:07.999
- ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh ♪

30:07.999 --> 30:10.999
♪ Oh oh
here comes the good life ♪

30:10.999 --> 30:13.999
♪ Oh oh oh oh oh ♪

30:13.999 --> 30:14.999
- You look amazing.

30:14.999 --> 30:15.999
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:15.999 --> 30:17.999
- Everybody's here.
- Yeah.

30:17.999 --> 30:18.999
- For emotional support.
- He needs some help.

30:18.999 --> 30:20.999
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

30:20.999 --> 30:22.999
- Wait, wait.
Did you just say you're ready?

30:22.999 --> 30:25.999
- I'm f***ing ready.
- Oh, my God, this is the day.

30:25.999 --> 30:29.000
- I literally have my memo
saved for Katie.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.999
Katie has a very clear vision
of what she wants

30:32.999 --> 30:34.000
as every girl does.

30:34.999 --> 30:35.999
- You got nice champagne
for us, Kyle.

30:35.999 --> 30:39.999
- Of course. I've waited
for this day forever.

30:39.999 --> 30:43.999
- I need to make sure Schwartz
executes this to perfection.

30:43.999 --> 30:44.999
- Whoo!

30:44.999 --> 30:46.999
- So the whole
"me working at Pump" thing

30:46.999 --> 30:47.999
was kind of a debacle.

30:47.999 --> 30:48.999
I'm out of my element
right now.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.999
What did I get myself into?

30:50.999 --> 30:52.999
I don't know if I'm cut out
for this whole work thing.

30:52.999 --> 30:56.999
One very good thing did come
from that one shift I worked.

30:56.999 --> 30:57.999
Meeting Kyle Chan.

30:57.999 --> 30:59.999
We've been friends ever since,

30:59.999 --> 31:01.999
and now I'm hoping
that he will assist me

31:01.999 --> 31:05.999
in designing the perfect ring
for Katie at the perfect price.

31:05.999 --> 31:07.999
The cost of a ring, you know,

31:07.999 --> 31:08.999
it's not a measure of how much
you love someone, right?

31:09.000 --> 31:10.999
- Yes.
- Yeah.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.999
- However, that being said,
I've been a colossal doucher

31:12.999 --> 31:13.999
for the past year.

31:13.999 --> 31:16.999
Initially, I wanted to spend
around, you know, four or five.

31:16.999 --> 31:19.999
- Okay.

31:19.999 --> 31:21.999
- Can you double it?
- This was double that.

31:21.999 --> 31:22.999
- Double?
- Yeah.

31:22.999 --> 31:24.000
- I have to be conservative

31:24.999 --> 31:26.999
because I do still have
my student loans and sh**.

31:26.999 --> 31:27.999
- Okay.

31:27.999 --> 31:28.999
- Schwartz,
why don't you, uh--

31:28.999 --> 31:30.999
- I can try on
whatever you need.

31:30.999 --> 31:32.000
- Let's do this.

31:32.999 --> 31:34.999
- Here's just a couple
you can choose from.

31:34.999 --> 31:36.999
- Whoa, there's a bunch
of diamonds in front of me.

31:36.999 --> 31:37.999
I'm scared.

31:40.999 --> 31:43.999
- This is similar
to the one she wants.

31:43.999 --> 31:44.999
- Yes.
- All right.

31:44.999 --> 31:47.999
- But you really
can't do it too small.

31:47.999 --> 31:49.000
- No, because then
it would just look bad.

31:49.999 --> 31:50.999
Yeah.

31:50.999 --> 31:53.999
- I'm going in here with,
like, such a lowball mentality,

31:53.999 --> 31:55.999
but then I'm like,
"You know what? f*** that."

31:55.999 --> 31:57.999
I want the perfect ring
for Katie

31:57.999 --> 31:59.999
because she's special
and she deserves it.

31:59.999 --> 32:01.999
- This one actually,
it's perfect

32:01.999 --> 32:03.999
because it's got
a three-karat face

32:03.999 --> 32:07.999
and it's got a perfect clarity
and shininess to it.

32:07.999 --> 32:09.999
- Oh, my God.
Can I hold it?

32:09.999 --> 32:10.999
Holy sh**.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.999
- Just look at the fire.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.999
- That is one
of sickest diamonds.

32:14.999 --> 32:15.999
- Yeah.
- Totally bedazzled right now.

32:15.999 --> 32:19.999
- What should this
entire ring cost?

32:19.999 --> 32:21.999
- Well, with the diamond
and the setting,

32:21.999 --> 32:26.999
I think we can stay
around 7 grand.

32:26.999 --> 32:28.999
- f***.
That's a lot.

32:28.999 --> 32:32.999
But that's the one I want.
That's the one she wants.

32:32.999 --> 32:36.999
- You can sell some of your
stuff, like your car or your--

32:36.999 --> 32:38.999
- f***.
- If you can swing it...

32:38.999 --> 32:39.999
- You can swing it.

32:39.999 --> 32:40.999
I saw you were in
a Modelo commercial, like,

32:40.999 --> 32:42.999
17 times in the last week,

32:42.999 --> 32:45.999
so you should have some
residuals coming in.

32:45.999 --> 32:47.000
This is it.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.999
I mean, sh**,
I'm really doing it, huh?

32:49.999 --> 32:51.999
- Do what you gotta do.

32:51.999 --> 32:53.999
- I'm gonna chug this.

32:53.999 --> 32:54.999
f***, go me.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.999
- I'm going to let you guys
talk about this.

32:56.999 --> 32:58.999
I'm going to go handle
a few things...

32:58.999 --> 32:59.999
- Okay. Thank you.
- And then I'll be right back.

32:59.999 --> 33:01.999
- Thank you, Kyle.

33:01.999 --> 33:03.999
That's f***ing perfect.
- Dude.

33:03.999 --> 33:06.999
- Does she buy me my ring
or do I buy my own ring?

33:06.999 --> 33:08.999
- Shay and I did that together.
- Yeah.

33:08.999 --> 33:09.999
- But now, like,
it's almost a year

33:09.999 --> 33:12.999
so now I'm going to need
to get my other band here,

33:12.999 --> 33:14.999
but I kind of want
to raise this,

33:14.999 --> 33:15.999
but I can't be without my ring.

33:15.999 --> 33:17.999
It's like, if someone sees me
without my ring, it's like,

33:17.999 --> 33:19.999
"Oh, my God."
- Yeah. Shady.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.999
- "They're getting a divorce."
- Yeah.

33:21.999 --> 33:24.000
- When was the last time
you talked to Shay?

33:24.999 --> 33:27.999
- Um...four days?

33:27.999 --> 33:29.000
Which is the longest
we've ever gone.

33:29.999 --> 33:31.999
- Scheana hasn't talked
to Shay in four days,

33:32.000 --> 33:35.999
and she's talking about adding
diamonds to her wedding ring,

33:35.999 --> 33:37.999
and that to me
is f***ing crazy.

33:37.999 --> 33:39.999
- Just formalities or did
you guys,

33:39.999 --> 33:42.999
like, start to get into it?
- I was crying so hysterically

33:42.999 --> 33:44.999
that I just ended up
hanging up on him.

33:44.999 --> 33:46.999
- Oh, f***. Holy sh**. Okay.
That answers my question.

33:46.999 --> 33:48.999
Yeah.

33:48.999 --> 33:49.999
- He's not in the best place.

33:49.999 --> 33:51.999
He drinks way too much.

33:51.999 --> 33:53.999
Like, it's so bad that it's

33:53.999 --> 33:56.999
affecting his psyche
and his mood.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.999
- Yeah.
- It is.

33:58.999 --> 34:02.999
- If he's not happy himself, how
can you guys be happy together?

34:02.999 --> 34:06.999
- Ugh.
I--anyway, so, rings.

34:06.999 --> 34:07.999
- I'm concerned that
if Scheana thinks

34:07.999 --> 34:09.999
that Shay's drinking too much,

34:09.999 --> 34:11.999
that maybe she's
been overbearing

34:11.999 --> 34:14.999
and Shay just felt like
he needed to get away.

34:14.999 --> 34:15.999
- So, you ready?

34:15.999 --> 34:17.999
Oh, I'm ready, baby.

34:17.999 --> 34:18.999
- So we're gonna do it.

34:18.999 --> 34:20.999
- We're doing it.
- Yes.

34:20.999 --> 34:22.999
That will make her really happy.
- It's worth it.

34:22.999 --> 34:24.999
- Dude.
- Congratu-f***ing-lations.

34:24.999 --> 34:25.999
- f***!
- Yes!

34:25.999 --> 34:27.999
Congratulations. Whoo!
- How about about f***ing time?

34:27.999 --> 34:29.999
- Yes, seriously.
- About f***ing time.

34:29.999 --> 34:31.999
- About f***ing time.

34:33.999 --> 34:34.999
- I've heard of some of
the girls who are getting

34:34.999 --> 34:36.999
a little bit antsy
in their pantsies.

34:36.999 --> 34:37.999
- They think I'm gonna
f*** their boyfriends

34:37.999 --> 34:39.999
or some bullsh**.

34:39.999 --> 34:41.999
- Why, do you like f***ing
people's boyfriends?

34:55.999 --> 34:57.999
- Thank you, guys.

35:00.999 --> 35:03.999
- You're making my ticket?
- What are you talking about?

35:03.999 --> 35:05.999
- Pump and Glory, Pump-tini,
like, five minutes ago?

35:05.999 --> 35:07.999
- Pump and Glory and Pump-tini?
I got you.

35:07.999 --> 35:08.999
- Thank you.

35:08.999 --> 35:09.999
Jax still doesn't know
how to make them.

35:09.999 --> 35:11.999
- I do know how to make them.
I do.

35:11.999 --> 35:12.999
I just choose not to.

35:12.999 --> 35:15.999
- What's in the Pump and Glory?

35:15.999 --> 35:16.999
- Muddled raspberry.
- Nope.

35:16.999 --> 35:18.999
- Yes.
- Already wrong.

35:18.999 --> 35:19.999
- Oh, the cucumber one.

35:19.999 --> 35:21.999
- That's the Pump-tini.
- That's the cucumber one.

35:21.999 --> 35:23.999
That's the Pump-tini.
You're right. The cucumber one.

35:23.999 --> 35:26.999
So it's cucumber, vodka,
triple syrup, St. Germain,

35:26.999 --> 35:29.999
shaken, not stirred.

35:29.999 --> 35:31.999
Nice.

35:31.999 --> 35:34.999
- Hey. Is Shay doing okay, man?
I texted him.

35:34.999 --> 35:36.999
- I don't want to get into it
here, but I just--

35:36.999 --> 35:38.999
- Yeah, I mean, we can talk
about it later if you want.

35:38.999 --> 35:41.999
- I just don't think he's
very happy right now, so...

35:41.999 --> 35:43.999
- Okay, I forgot
to sugar rim that.

35:43.999 --> 35:46.999
- That's fine.

35:46.999 --> 35:47.999
- She's really upset.
Scheana.

35:47.999 --> 35:49.999
I just feel like
she's really down.

35:49.999 --> 35:53.999
I've never seen her really upset
about issues on the home front.

35:53.999 --> 35:55.999
Here's the thing about Scheana
and Shay's relationship.

35:55.999 --> 35:57.999
She wants everyone to think
everything's perfect,

35:57.999 --> 36:00.999
so she puts on this show,
this act like,

36:00.999 --> 36:03.000
"Hey, everything's great,
everything's hunky-dory,"

36:03.999 --> 36:04.999
but it's really not.

36:04.999 --> 36:06.999
- I feel like if something
can be done, like,

36:06.999 --> 36:10.999
I want to help in any way I can,
you know?

36:10.999 --> 36:11.999
- What can you do?

36:11.999 --> 36:13.999
- I don't know, whatever,
like, talk to Shay, man.

36:13.999 --> 36:15.999
Maybe he just needs a friend.

36:19.999 --> 36:23.999
- Sur Lounge. This is Lala.
How can I help you?

36:23.999 --> 36:25.000
I don't have anything at 7:45.

36:25.999 --> 36:27.999
Is there any other time
that you would want?

36:27.999 --> 36:30.999
Yeah, the only thing
I have is 10:00.

36:30.999 --> 36:32.999
For how many people
did you say?

36:32.999 --> 36:34.999
Okay.
Thank you, bye-bye.

36:34.999 --> 36:35.999
- What's going on?
- Hi.

36:35.999 --> 36:37.999
- How are you doing?
Give you a hug?

36:37.999 --> 36:38.999
- I've been wondering--yeah.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.999
How are you, suge?
- What's up?

36:40.999 --> 36:44.999
I'm chilling.
How do you like it so far?

36:44.999 --> 36:45.999
- It's good.
- It's good?

36:45.999 --> 36:47.999
- Yeah. It's a little
intimidating sometimes.

36:47.999 --> 36:49.999
- I've heard some of the girls
are getting a little bit

36:49.999 --> 36:52.000
antsy in their pantsies.

36:52.999 --> 36:54.999
You have an issue
with, like, Kate and Scheana?

36:54.999 --> 36:55.999
I heard something was
going on between them

36:55.999 --> 36:57.999
that they didn't like.

36:57.999 --> 36:58.999
- They think I'm gonna
f*** their boyfriends

36:58.999 --> 37:00.999
or some bullsh**.
I don't know.

37:00.999 --> 37:02.999
- Why, do you like f***ing
people's boyfriends?

37:02.999 --> 37:03.999
- No.

37:03.999 --> 37:05.999
- Are you telling me the truth?
- Well--

37:05.999 --> 37:07.999
- We're in truth circle
right now, Lala.

37:07.999 --> 37:10.999
- I mean, if I hit on you
and you tell me

37:10.999 --> 37:12.999
you don't have a girlfriend,
and we happen to hit it

37:12.999 --> 37:13.999
with each other
and then I find out

37:13.999 --> 37:15.999
you have a girlfriend,
then that's not really my fault.

37:15.999 --> 37:17.999
- Oh, that's a different story
though. That's not your fault.

37:17.999 --> 37:19.999
- That's your bad.
- No, that wouldn't be my bad

37:19.999 --> 37:21.999
because I don't cheat
on my girlfriend.

37:21.999 --> 37:23.999
No.

37:23.999 --> 37:25.999
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

37:25.999 --> 37:27.999
Well, except for that
one time with Jenna.

37:27.999 --> 37:30.000
You're obviously a good-looking
girl, you start working at Sur,

37:30.999 --> 37:31.999
and people get intimidated
real quick.

37:31.999 --> 37:33.999
Little girl drama. I wouldn't
read too much into it.

37:33.999 --> 37:35.999
All the girls here are gonna
be bitches at some point.

37:35.999 --> 37:38.999
Just be nice, smile,
and just be yourself, you know?

37:38.999 --> 37:41.999
- Let's be real right now.
Do you have my back?

37:41.999 --> 37:42.999
- I've got your back.
- Do you swear to God?

37:42.999 --> 37:43.999
- Yeah.

37:43.999 --> 37:44.999
- Because I'm feeling
really alone

37:44.999 --> 37:45.999
in this location right now.

37:45.999 --> 37:46.999
- No, I mean--look,
Lala, I'm a guy,

37:46.999 --> 37:47.999
so I'll just always
tell it straight up,

37:48.000 --> 37:49.999
and I'm an English dude too,
so, you know,

37:49.999 --> 37:50.999
I say it how it is
all the time.

37:50.999 --> 37:52.999
- Yeah. I don't beat
around the bush.

37:52.999 --> 37:55.999
- No, I don't like bushes.
I don't like bushes.

37:55.999 --> 37:57.999
We don't need to beat
around any bushes.

37:57.999 --> 37:58.999
- No bushes.
- No bush.

37:58.999 --> 37:59.999
- You're disgusting.

37:59.999 --> 38:01.999
James the DJ.

38:01.999 --> 38:06.999
I've never been one to go
for the little skinny guys,

38:06.999 --> 38:09.999
but I don't know what it is
about him. Maybe the accent.

38:09.999 --> 38:10.999
- All right, I got
to get back to work.

38:10.999 --> 38:14.999
- All right, man.
- All right, I'll see you later.

38:24.999 --> 38:28.999
- I did not forget
your sparkling water.

38:28.999 --> 38:31.000
- Okay.
So you had the strawberry?

38:31.000 --> 38:32.999
- Yeah.
- Oh, there you go.

38:32.999 --> 38:34.999
- Thank you.
- Perfect.

38:34.999 --> 38:35.999
Hi.
- Hello.

38:35.999 --> 38:37.999
- Um, Peter is getting your tea

38:37.999 --> 38:38.999
'cause he needed to run upstairs
and grab

38:38.999 --> 38:40.999
some more English Breakfast.
- Okay.

38:40.999 --> 38:42.999
You want to talk to me?
- I do. Is that okay?

38:42.999 --> 38:43.999
- Are you working right now or--

38:43.999 --> 38:45.999
- I just closed out
my last lounge table

38:45.999 --> 38:47.999
and Brooke's watching
the veranda for me.

38:47.999 --> 38:49.999
- Okay, sit down.
Yeah?

38:53.999 --> 38:54.999
What is it?

38:54.999 --> 38:56.999
Okay, hold on.

38:56.999 --> 38:58.999
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Peter.

38:58.999 --> 39:00.000
- You're welcome.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
- I've known you
a long time, Scheana.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.999
I know there's something wrong.

39:02.999 --> 39:03.999
I don't often see you tearful

39:03.999 --> 39:06.999
and I'm a little concerned,
but go on,

39:06.999 --> 39:09.999
tell me I've got nothing
to be concerned about, please.

39:09.999 --> 39:11.999
- It's nothing work-related.

39:11.999 --> 39:15.999
It has been affecting me
at work because, you know,

39:15.999 --> 39:17.000
people constantly ask,

39:17.999 --> 39:18.999
"Oh, you're married.
Let me see your ring.

39:18.999 --> 39:20.999
How's your marriage?"

39:20.999 --> 39:21.999
And I just,
"Oh, it's great," you know?

39:21.999 --> 39:24.999
And I just put on my happy face
and the truth is,

39:24.999 --> 39:26.999
everything isn't great.

39:26.999 --> 39:29.999
It's not perfect.
- Oh, God.

39:29.999 --> 39:33.999
- And I keep trying to act
like everything's okay,

39:33.999 --> 39:35.999
it'll get better
if I just keep telling myself

39:35.999 --> 39:36.999
it'll be okay
and it'll get better.

39:36.999 --> 39:39.999
- Okay, hold on a second,
take a breath.

39:39.999 --> 39:41.999
What are the problems?

39:41.999 --> 39:44.999
- It all just started kind of
around, like, Christmastime.

39:44.999 --> 39:45.999
- Christmas?
So that was--

39:45.999 --> 39:47.999
- Just a few months ago.
- Three months in.

39:47.999 --> 39:52.999
- I noticed his drinking
increased a lot.

39:52.999 --> 39:55.999
Just more than drinking.

39:55.999 --> 39:57.000
- What do you mean,
more than drinking?

39:57.999 --> 39:59.999
- I mean, you know, the mixing
of pills with alcohol

39:59.999 --> 40:01.999
is just a double depressant.

40:01.999 --> 40:04.999
- What?
Mixing with pills with alcohol?

40:04.999 --> 40:06.999
- You know, it's like,
"Oh, my knee's hurting

40:06.999 --> 40:07.999
"so I'm gonna take a Vicodin,

40:07.999 --> 40:09.999
but then I'm gonna have
a couple glasses of wine,"

40:09.999 --> 40:11.999
and it--

40:11.999 --> 40:12.999
- On a regular basis
or you're just saying

40:12.999 --> 40:14.999
like when his knee
is actually hurting or is--

40:14.999 --> 40:17.999
- It got to the point where
it was on a regular basis.

40:17.999 --> 40:18.999
- Like, how often?

40:18.999 --> 40:21.999
- He was taking five a day
and I had absolutely no idea.

40:21.999 --> 40:23.999
- Five a day?

40:33.999 --> 40:35.999
is just a double depressant.

40:35.999 --> 40:37.999
- Like, how often?

40:37.999 --> 40:39.999
- He was taking five a day
and I had absolutely no idea.

40:39.999 --> 40:41.999
- Five a day?

40:41.999 --> 40:44.999
I thought he was a little
lethargic, to be honest.

40:44.999 --> 40:45.999
A little unmotivated.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.999
But I never thought he was high.

40:47.999 --> 40:49.999
So he's bloody addicted
to it then.

40:49.999 --> 40:51.999
- It just, literally,
like, just shook my world.

40:51.999 --> 40:54.999
I'm like, I feel like
I've been cheated on.

40:54.999 --> 40:56.999
Like, you have this whole other
life that I never knew of.

40:56.999 --> 40:58.999
You're doing this every day,
and you're hiding it from me

40:58.999 --> 40:59.999
and, like, I didn't know.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.999
- Okay, pull yourself together.

41:01.999 --> 41:02.999
You've got to work, okay?

41:03.000 --> 41:05.999
Breathe through your nose.
Pull yourself together.

41:05.999 --> 41:07.000
- I had no idea.
- Okay, go on.

41:07.999 --> 41:08.999
You're right.
He's being unfaithful to you,

41:08.999 --> 41:11.999
cheating on you, it's disloyal
because he hasn't been honest.

41:11.999 --> 41:14.999
He's guilty by omission.
- I mean--

41:14.999 --> 41:16.999
- I mean, he was.
What--he's addicted to a drug.

41:16.999 --> 41:18.000
What defines a drug addict?

41:18.000 --> 41:19.999
You're right to take
this seriously,

41:19.999 --> 41:22.999
you're right to be upset,
and it's not only that,

41:22.999 --> 41:25.999
but it kind of opens the door
to a lot of other questions.

41:25.999 --> 41:27.999
- Absolutely.
- You know?

41:27.999 --> 41:30.999
Is he the man that you thought
he was? Clearly he's not.

41:30.999 --> 41:31.999
- I'm just so afraid
and that's why

41:31.999 --> 41:36.999
I've just kind of been a mess
because I want him to be okay.

41:38.999 --> 41:40.999
Am I a bad wife?
Am I a bad person?

41:40.999 --> 41:44.999
Am I so self-centered
that I don't see what's wrong

41:44.999 --> 41:46.999
literally in my home?

Now I don't even know what's
affecting our relationship.

42:41.999 --> 42:44.999
- You f**ing cheat on me
with your sorry dick.

42:44.999 --> 42:45.999
- Get over it, Kristen.

42:45.999 --> 42:47.999
- Are you guys willing
to work this stuff out

42:47.999 --> 42:49.999
or do you just want
to keep hurting each other?

42:49.999 --> 42:50.999
- Get off a little early,
clock out,

42:50.999 --> 42:51.999
and then come see me,
all right?

42:51.999 --> 42:53.999
- Yeah.
Let's do it.

42:53.999 --> 42:54.999
- Shay's staying
at his parents' house.

42:54.999 --> 42:56.999
They're not actually
really talking right now.

42:56.999 --> 42:59.999
Scheana has a little bit of
anger right now towards Shay.

42:59.999 --> 43:03.999
They're having some issues.

43:03.999 --> 43:06.999
- I have been so miserable
this past week.

43:06.999 --> 43:09.999
- I've been so miserable
and lonely for two years.

43:09.999 --> 43:13.999
- Why did you marry me?
Like, why?

43:13.999 --> 43:14.999
