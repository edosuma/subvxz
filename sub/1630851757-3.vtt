<i>- Tonight we've got Questlove</i>
<i>and Tariq from The Roots,</i>

00:14.080 --> 00:16.383
<i>your guide to being</i>
<i>a birthday baller,</i>

00:16.416 --> 00:18.918
<i>and cakes flippin'</i>
<i>their sheets.</i>

00:18.952 --> 00:21.287
<i>The only show banned</i>
<i>from detention,</i>

00:21.321 --> 00:23.723
<i>it's "The Kids Tonight Show."</i>

00:23.757 --> 00:26.726
<i>[exciting music]</i>

00:26.760 --> 00:30.263
<i>* *</i>

00:30.296 --> 00:33.166
- Give it up for the rebels
of 30 Rock, Olivia...

00:33.199 --> 00:35.101
- Whoo! Hi!

00:35.135 --> 00:38.972
<i>* *</i>

00:39.005 --> 00:42.509
- Dylan, and Mykal-Michelle.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.611
<i>* *</i>

00:44.644 --> 00:45.812
- Hello!

00:45.845 --> 00:48.615
Hi!

00:48.648 --> 00:53.586
- And keep it going for our own
little Questlove, Recker.

00:53.620 --> 00:57.090
[cheers and applause]

00:57.123 --> 00:58.792
- Welcome
to "The Kids Tonight Show,"

00:58.825 --> 01:03.129
the only show that
can't drive yet, legally.

01:03.163 --> 01:04.664
[laughter]

01:04.698 --> 01:06.766
I'm Young Dylan, and we've got
a great show you for tonight.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.134
[cheers and applause]

01:08.168 --> 01:10.603
- But first, mayhem.
<i>[siren wailing]</i>

01:10.637 --> 01:13.440
I'm Mykal-Michelle, reminding
you that every episode,

01:13.473 --> 01:16.509
there's a new secret passcode
that launches mayhem,

01:16.543 --> 01:21.081
the craziest 30 seconds
in the world.

01:21.114 --> 01:22.682
You all at home
and in the audience

01:22.716 --> 01:25.218
get to see the passcode,
but none of us do.

01:25.251 --> 01:26.986
So here it is.
<i>[bell dings]</i>

01:29.189 --> 01:30.757
- I wonder what it is.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.892
But first, the monologue.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.561
[cheers and applause]

01:34.594 --> 01:37.931
Did you guys hear that
there was a T. rex skeleton

01:37.964 --> 01:40.800
that got sold for
over $30 million?

01:40.834 --> 01:42.369
- Whoa.
<i>[cash register dings]</i>

01:42.402 --> 01:44.671
- What's a T. rex gonna do
with $30 million, huh?

01:44.704 --> 01:47.474
[laughter]
He's dead.

01:47.507 --> 01:49.876
- That's what I said.
Well, I think it's weird

01:49.909 --> 01:52.779
that the great T. rex
has tiny little arms.

01:52.812 --> 01:55.915
- Mm.
[laughter]

01:55.949 --> 01:57.817
- Hey, T. rex,
sure, you're, like,

01:57.851 --> 01:59.552
the king
of the dinosaurs,

01:59.586 --> 02:01.888
but don't skip
the arm workouts.

02:01.921 --> 02:04.124
[cheers and applause]

02:04.157 --> 02:06.493
- My favorite dinosaur
is the triceratops,

02:06.526 --> 02:11.431
but when I'm sad, my favorite
dinosaur is the cry-ceratops.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.767
<i>[baby crying]</i>
- [laughs]

02:13.800 --> 02:15.402
- Oh, I got one. I got one.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.337
What do you call
a British dinosaur?

02:17.370 --> 02:18.371
- What?

02:18.405 --> 02:20.707
- Teatime rex, mate.
[rim shot]

02:20.740 --> 02:24.077
- Ooh, okay.
- And that's our monologue.

02:24.077 --> 02:25.378
[cheers and applause]

02:25.412 --> 02:27.547
- Hey, Mykal-Michelle,
last one to get to the desk

02:27.580 --> 02:28.915
has to eat fried worms.

02:28.948 --> 02:30.517
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.987
I won.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.321
- Wait a second.

02:35.355 --> 02:38.358
Can someone start preparing
Dylan a fried worm?

02:38.391 --> 02:40.994
- I am not eating a fried worm.

02:41.094 --> 02:43.296
- Oh, yes, you are, mister.

02:43.329 --> 02:47.767
<i>[shimmering tone]</i>

02:47.801 --> 02:50.003
Watch out, Dylan,
it's coming.

02:50.103 --> 02:51.805
Hi, everyone.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.007
I'm Olivia,
and I'm here at the desk,

02:54.107 --> 02:56.109
ready to bring you
some vital information

02:56.142 --> 02:59.412
that every kid out there
needs to hear.

02:59.446 --> 03:02.082
Presenting...

03:02.115 --> 03:06.353
"'The Kids Tonight Show'
Birthday Handbook."

03:06.386 --> 03:08.555
[cheers and applause]

03:08.588 --> 03:11.057
This is your guide
to tips and tricks

03:11.057 --> 03:13.226
for getting the most
out of your birthday.

03:13.259 --> 03:14.494
Grab a pen.

03:14.527 --> 03:18.264
This information could
change your life forever.

03:18.298 --> 03:20.767
Tip one: cakes.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.602
If you go with a regular cake,

03:22.635 --> 03:24.771
your parents will make you
save it for later,

03:24.804 --> 03:27.073
but an ice cream cake melts,

03:27.107 --> 03:30.377
so it needs to go
in your mouth right now.

03:30.410 --> 03:34.214
- Yeah.
- Next tip: presents.

03:34.247 --> 03:37.484
Make sure you stay on your
generous aunt's good side

03:37.517 --> 03:40.453
with thank-you notes
and big hugs,

03:40.487 --> 03:43.690
but your uncle that gets
you those dress socks...

03:43.723 --> 03:46.760
he's out of the family.
- Oh, yeah. Yes.

03:46.793 --> 03:49.896
- Next tip: the party.

03:49.929 --> 03:54.901
Simple, invite everybody.
It's the nice thing to do.

03:54.934 --> 03:58.238
It also means more gifts
than a mall Santa.

03:58.271 --> 04:00.373
<i>- Ho, ho, ho.</i>
- Oh, yeah.

04:00.407 --> 04:03.843
- All right, next tip:
goodie bags.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.613
They're presents other people
get, but if you have

04:06.646 --> 04:10.650
some no-shows, guess who
keeps the leftovers.

04:10.684 --> 04:14.120
This birthday girl.

04:14.154 --> 04:18.058
And finally: the sugar crash.

04:18.058 --> 04:21.461
Avoid a birthday sugar crash
with this easy trick.

04:21.494 --> 04:24.497
Never stop eating sugar,
and you won't crash.

04:24.531 --> 04:26.066
Win-win.
<i>[bell dinging]</i>

04:26.099 --> 04:27.600
[cheers and applause]

04:27.634 --> 04:30.704
Follow our birthday handbook,
and you'll be celebrating

04:30.737 --> 04:33.106
your birthday year like a pro.

04:33.139 --> 04:36.242
- Oh, yeah.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.178
- And that was
the birthday handbook.

04:38.211 --> 04:41.181
Thanks, Olivia.
- Mm-hmm. My pleasure.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.350
- Guess what, everyone.
We will be right back

04:43.383 --> 04:45.485
with Mr. Questlove
and Mr. Black Thought

04:45.518 --> 04:46.953
from The Roots

04:46.986 --> 04:48.888
and a catastrophe of a game.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.857
Stick around.
We'll be right back.

04:50.890 --> 04:57.163
<i>* *</i>

05:00.633 --> 05:05.171
[cheers and applause]

05:05.205 --> 05:07.607
- Welcome back
to "The Kids Tonight Show."

05:07.640 --> 05:11.678
Our guests tonight are multiple
Grammy and Tony award winners.

05:11.711 --> 05:13.513
You see them every night
on "The Tonight Show"

05:13.546 --> 05:15.515
with our bestie, Jimmy Fallon.

05:15.548 --> 05:18.518
Say hello to Questlove and
Black Thought from The Roots.

05:18.551 --> 05:20.320
[cheers and applause]

05:20.353 --> 05:22.055
- Yes!

05:22.088 --> 05:24.958
- Hey, what's up?
- What's up? What's up?

05:25.058 --> 05:26.593
What's up, man?

05:26.626 --> 05:30.330
- Hi. So nice to meet you.
- Hi.

05:30.363 --> 05:33.066
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hi.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.935
- Nice to meet you guys.
- Hi.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.938
- Welcome.
- Thank you for coming here.

05:38.972 --> 05:41.207
- Thank you so much
for having us, thank you.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.309
- Wow, it is so awesome
to meet you.

05:43.343 --> 05:46.079
Like, I see you every time on
the--on the Mr. Fallon show.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.948
- Well, we also see you guys
going up and down the hallway.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.984
- And we hear--we hear
you guys a lot.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.385
- We hear you, yeah.
- We hear--

05:52.419 --> 05:53.553
- My dressing room is, like,
right next to you guys.

05:53.586 --> 05:54.688
- Yeah, yeah.

05:54.721 --> 05:56.690
- Okay, you guys work
with Mr. Jimmy

05:56.723 --> 05:58.258
literally every day.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.360
- Yeah, I know.
Tell me about it.

06:00.393 --> 06:03.329
No, I'm just--I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.299
- I mean, he's our bestie.
You have any tips for us?

06:06.332 --> 06:10.470
- I mean, you know, Jimmy
or Mr. Jimmy or--

06:10.503 --> 06:12.205
- Yeah, I'm like, "Mr. Jimmy?
Who's Mr. Jimmy?"

06:12.238 --> 06:15.041
- Mr. Jimmy's really easy
to get along with, you know?

06:15.041 --> 06:17.444
He likes to have a lot of fun.
- He's a kid.

06:17.477 --> 06:20.080
- He's a kid at heart,
so I think, you know,

06:20.113 --> 06:22.515
half the battle is just
getting over the fact

06:22.549 --> 06:24.884
that he's a lot taller
and older than you

06:24.918 --> 06:26.386
and just, you know,
dealing with him--

06:26.419 --> 06:29.589
like, realize that Mr. Jimmy
is on your level.

06:29.622 --> 06:31.958
- Is 13.
[laughter]

06:32.058 --> 06:34.260
- Okay, we've been talking
a lot

06:34.294 --> 06:35.862
about birthdays on the show,

06:35.895 --> 06:38.131
and you played at
the Obamas' birthday parties.

06:38.164 --> 06:39.933
How cool are Sasha and Malia?

06:39.966 --> 06:41.935
- Oh.
- Ah.

06:41.968 --> 06:45.138
- You know, Sasha and Malia
are really, really sweet

06:45.171 --> 06:46.606
and really cool.

06:46.639 --> 06:48.241
You know, it's been great

06:48.274 --> 06:50.577
to sort of watch them grow up
because we--

06:50.610 --> 06:54.781
you know, we've been around
for--you know, since before

06:54.814 --> 06:57.250
Barack Obama was elected.
- Dang.

06:57.283 --> 07:00.286
- So, you know, like, during
his campaign, we sort of met.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.922
And he talked about
how The Roots was not only,

07:03.023 --> 07:04.591
like, the house band
for "The Tonight Show"

07:04.624 --> 07:08.595
but we were also sort of like
the Obamas' house band.

07:08.628 --> 07:11.031
- That's awesome.
- That's so sweet.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.632
- Well, most of us
weren't even born

07:12.665 --> 07:15.669
when he--before he was elected,
so dang.

07:15.702 --> 07:16.770
- I don't think none of us
were born.

07:16.803 --> 07:18.938
- Your parents
weren't dating yet.

07:19.039 --> 07:22.142
- So what's the best part of
making music with your friends?

07:22.175 --> 07:23.410
- Yeah.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.945
- I mean, it's super fun,
right, but, you know,

07:26.046 --> 07:29.349
if making music with
your friends is your job,

07:29.382 --> 07:32.085
it doesn't really feel like
you have that much work to do.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.286
It's not, like,
hard, hard work.

07:33.319 --> 07:34.454
- Yeah 'cause
you're having fun.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.122
- It's called a passion,
you know, like--

07:36.156 --> 07:37.490
- Music's amazing.

07:37.524 --> 07:39.693
- We always say that--
you know, like, we sometimes

07:39.726 --> 07:41.795
have to get up really early
to go to work

07:41.828 --> 07:45.198
or to do a show, so if
you're, like, willing to get up

07:45.231 --> 07:47.600
that early in the morning
and willing to go to bed

07:47.634 --> 07:49.202
that late,
like, that's a passion.

07:49.235 --> 07:51.137
It's never a job, yeah.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.939
- That's awesome.
- That's awesome.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.841
- Music, like,
brings people together.

07:54.874 --> 07:57.277
It's just so beautiful
how music does that.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.446
It's crazy.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.148
- When you're, like, drifting
off to sleep or, like,

08:02.182 --> 08:05.118
have, like, a beat through your
head, with both of you guys,

08:05.151 --> 08:08.021
like, where do you--
do you just wake up

08:08.054 --> 08:10.323
and go to your
whatever you use,

08:10.357 --> 08:12.192
write it down,
have a pen or paper?

08:12.225 --> 08:14.794
Like, 'cause I do that all the
time and I wake my parents up.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.896
- We don't sleep.
No, I'm playing.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.265
Thing is,
is that I've discovered

08:19.299 --> 08:21.634
maybe in the past five years...
- Mm-hmm.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.504
- How valuable--and this
is gonna be weird to you--

08:24.537 --> 08:28.875
how valuable boredom is,
boredom and silence.

08:28.908 --> 08:30.677
- Yeah.
- Because oftentimes,

08:30.710 --> 08:31.911
especially now,

08:31.945 --> 08:35.048
the temptation to always
pull out our phones

08:35.081 --> 08:37.183
and entertain ourselves
every few seconds,

08:37.217 --> 08:39.953
that takes away
the thought process

08:40.053 --> 08:42.088
of where those ideas come.

08:42.122 --> 08:45.558
So usually an hour a day,
I literally like to sit

08:45.592 --> 08:48.828
in an isolated room
and get bored.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.831
And usually by the 20th minute
or 25th minute,

08:51.865 --> 08:53.433
that's when ideas come to you.

08:53.466 --> 08:54.668
That's when inspiration comes.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.103
So you have to sit
in silence sometimes.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.772
- That's really cool.
- That's awesome

08:58.805 --> 09:00.306
- That's super interesting
to know about because,

09:00.340 --> 09:02.709
like, oh, boredom, like,
is not very good

09:02.742 --> 09:04.010
'cause you're not doing
anything.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.012
But there's another side
to that that's also, like,

09:06.012 --> 09:07.447
it helps you
be creative and stuff.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.315
- Yes.
- That's really crazy.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.184
That's awesome.
- That's awesome.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.688
- Tariq, you're a dad, so what
kind of music do you like

09:14.721 --> 09:16.022
or do your kids like?

09:16.056 --> 09:19.359
- Well, I--you know,
I like old music,

09:19.392 --> 09:22.829
you know, stuff from,
like, the '60s, '70s, '80s,

09:22.862 --> 09:24.631
and that's what my kids
do not like.

09:24.664 --> 09:26.199
[laughter]
You know?

09:26.232 --> 09:28.134
My kids like, you know,
more contemporary stuff.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.537
They don't really listen
to The Roots like that.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.073
I have some classics
that, you know, sometimes

09:33.106 --> 09:36.109
my kids will hit, you know,
like a wave.

09:36.142 --> 09:38.745
Like, my daughter--I have
a daughter who's 15 years old,

09:38.778 --> 09:40.914
and she never really liked
any of my stuff

09:40.947 --> 09:43.283
until, you know, recently,

09:43.316 --> 09:44.617
and, you know, but--

09:44.651 --> 09:46.820
so I see her listening
to my music,

09:46.853 --> 09:48.221
and now I know
I have to be careful.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.356
I can't let her know

09:49.389 --> 09:52.192
that it makes me
excited or happy

09:52.225 --> 09:53.626
to know that she's
listening to it,

09:53.660 --> 09:55.762
'cause then she won't
listen to it, so...

09:55.795 --> 09:58.898
I'll see her, you know,
like, something on her phone

09:58.932 --> 10:00.400
or she'll have her EarPods in,

10:00.433 --> 10:02.035
and I'm like
"What are you listening to?"

10:02.068 --> 10:04.337
And she'll say, "Oh, actually
this is, you know, your thing."

10:04.371 --> 10:06.806
Or she'll show it to me
and I'll just go like...

10:08.141 --> 10:10.176
- Yeah, you try to--
you try--you try not to show

10:10.210 --> 10:11.678
all the emotions,
you know.

10:11.711 --> 10:14.948
- Hey, Questlove, how often do
you do rim shots for Jimmy?

10:14.981 --> 10:17.684
<i>[rim shot]</i>
- You know what?

10:17.717 --> 10:20.387
Jimmy doesn't like when--
in the very beginning,

10:20.420 --> 10:23.990
I used to do rim shots after
a joke, but he never liked.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.592
So I do it only if the joke

10:25.625 --> 10:27.794
is, like, really funny
and undeniable.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.696
Or sometimes
if the joke doesn't work,

10:29.729 --> 10:31.231
that's when the rim shot
really works, so...

10:31.264 --> 10:32.232
- Right.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.401
- How do you get your beard--

10:34.434 --> 10:35.835
how do you get it that awesome?

10:35.869 --> 10:36.903
Like, look at it, man.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.471
I'm trying to get one too,
you know.

10:38.505 --> 10:39.706
- I mean...
- I got a few years.

10:39.739 --> 10:40.940
- I'd give it another
couple years.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.443
I've had this since
I was about 11, so...

10:43.476 --> 10:45.078
- What?
- Yes.

10:45.111 --> 10:47.147
- So you're telling me I could
grow a beard right now--

10:47.180 --> 10:48.782
- Yeah, man, you know,
you can do whatever--

10:48.815 --> 10:50.617
whatever you put your mind to.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.452
Any of you. Either of you.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.054
- We're from Philly, you know.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.122
In Philadelphia, you have
to have a full beard.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.590
- Yeah, it's important.
- It's required.

10:57.624 --> 10:58.925
- So you guys are from Philly,

10:58.958 --> 11:01.227
so are you guys
Philadelphia Eagles fans?

11:01.261 --> 11:03.730
- Of course.
- Yes, yes.

11:03.763 --> 11:04.731
- Come on, man.

11:04.764 --> 11:05.732
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

11:05.765 --> 11:07.400
- Questlove, have you ever been

11:07.434 --> 11:09.069
on an actual quest?

11:09.069 --> 11:11.671
- As a matter of fact...

11:11.705 --> 11:15.075
[lightsaber humming]
I have.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.577
- Whoa!

11:17.610 --> 11:21.348
- See? And my quest was always

11:21.381 --> 11:24.684
to wind up
on "The Kids Tonight Show."

11:24.718 --> 11:26.319
[cheers and applause]
I made it.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.154
- That's crazy.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.889
- Man, he achieved it.
- Whoa.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.224
- Yes.
- He did.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.693
- Wow.
- That's awesome.

11:33.727 --> 11:36.162
- That is so cool.
- How did you two meet?

11:36.196 --> 11:39.332
- Well, Quest and I
met in high school.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.301
- I was the nerd
with the drum machine.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.436
- Yeah, he was the nerd.
- And he was the cool guy.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.738
- He had a drum machine.

11:44.771 --> 11:46.673
- And the only way
that I could get

11:46.706 --> 11:49.275
at the cool kids' table was,
I had to do something.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.411
So back then in lunch break,
you would just have these

11:51.444 --> 11:53.213
freestyle periods
for, like, an hour

11:53.246 --> 11:56.449
where someone would have
to bang on the desk,

11:56.483 --> 11:57.784
but I had a drum machine.

11:57.817 --> 11:59.019
- Oh, we were doing that
in elementary school.

11:59.119 --> 12:02.155
Man, I miss those moments, man.
[laughter]

12:02.188 --> 12:06.359
- What I noticed
when you were rapping for us

12:06.393 --> 12:09.929
about a week or so ago was that
you keep your own beat.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.265
I think that's cool, you know,
when you see kids

12:12.298 --> 12:14.067
who are self-sufficient
in that way,

12:14.067 --> 12:16.302
who are able to, like,
sing a song or--

12:16.336 --> 12:17.837
- Wait, I want to see you
do it right now.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.773
- Me?
- Yeah, yeah. We kinda do.

12:19.806 --> 12:21.941
- Recker, you want to show them
what we got, yo?

12:21.975 --> 12:23.076
You want to show them
what we got, Recker?

12:23.076 --> 12:24.277
- Let's do this.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.079
- Man, I don't think
I really want it, man.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.480
- Oh, he's got the buckets.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.649
- I don't think
I really want it, man.

12:29.683 --> 12:31.418
Recker, let's go, yo.
- Let's do this.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.987
Let's do this.
- Hey.

Hey, yeah.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.094
* Hey, people really mad

* Putting up my stacks *

12:53.907 --> 12:55.475
* Like I'm good
at playing "Fortnite" *

12:55.508 --> 12:58.111
* It's up and you're stuck
like the gravity, y'all *

12:58.111 --> 13:01.247
* Can't get up on this level,
ain't no ladder this tall *

13:01.281 --> 13:04.184
* Rims got them offset,
everybody upset *

13:04.217 --> 13:06.152
* I came out the dirt
like I dug up *

13:06.186 --> 13:07.354
* Boy, I'm up next *

13:07.387 --> 13:09.222

what kind of car *

13:18.131 --> 13:20.266

- Oh.

13:20.300 --> 13:24.204
[cheers and applause]

13:27.474 --> 13:29.075
- Great job.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.310
- Whoa.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.212
- So, Dylan,
I mean, you are--

13:32.245 --> 13:33.813
you are pretty slick
on the mic

13:33.847 --> 13:35.248
and quick on the mic.

13:35.281 --> 13:38.485
One might go as far to say
you are sick.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.420
[cheers and applause]

13:40.453 --> 13:42.655

have to go

14:19.059 --> 14:20.827
to "The Tonight Show"
right across the hall,

14:20.860 --> 14:23.797
but we'll see you
after the break.

14:23.830 --> 14:26.866
[cheers and applause]

14:30.570 --> 14:33.073
[cheers and applause]

14:33.073 --> 14:35.342
- Welcome back
to "The Kids Tonight Show."

14:35.375 --> 14:37.510
Here we love sheet cakes

14:37.544 --> 14:39.446
like these birthday cakes
right here.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.081
[cheers and applause]

14:41.081 --> 14:43.883
But what we love more
than sheet cakes

14:43.917 --> 14:46.086
is making a mess
with sheet cakes.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.420
- Yeah.

14:47.454 --> 14:50.090
- It's time to Flip Your Sheet.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.859
[cheers and applause]

14:52.892 --> 14:55.328
<i>[whimsical music]</i>

14:55.362 --> 14:57.430
In this game, each of us
have been given

14:57.464 --> 15:00.533
a beautiful and delicious
sheet cake.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.335
But before we can have
any of it,

15:02.369 --> 15:03.870
we have to prove
we're worthy.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.039
One by one, we'll take
our sheet cake,

15:06.039 --> 15:09.175
present it, and throw it
in the air so it flips.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.644
And then we're gonna
have to try to

15:11.678 --> 15:13.346
catch it on the way down
like this.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.782
<i>- Oh.</i>

15:15.815 --> 15:17.517
<i>- All right I see you,</i>
<i>Grandma.</i>

15:17.550 --> 15:20.854
<i>- Whoa.</i>
<i>- Whoa.</i>

15:24.057 --> 15:25.325
- Yes, exactly like that.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.560
So if we can successfully

15:27.594 --> 15:29.829
flip the sheet cakes,
we get to eat the cake.

15:29.863 --> 15:32.298
If we can't flip it
without dropping it,

15:32.332 --> 15:34.968
well, we could still eat it.
- Yeah.

15:35.068 --> 15:38.338
- But we won't want to.
Ready, guys?

15:38.371 --> 15:40.840
Let's flip our sheets.

15:40.874 --> 15:43.076
Olivia, you're first.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.111
- Yeah, let's go, Olivia.
- Okay.

15:45.145 --> 15:48.982
- Go.
- Get your cake. Get your cake.

Whoo!

Let's look at that.

Okay, you're up next, Dylan.
