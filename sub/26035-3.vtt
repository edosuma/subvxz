I'm confused. Wade who?

Wade Boggs.
He's a Hall of Fame baseball guy

00:47.003 --> 00:48.744
Right? So it's a new idea.

Okay, I just feel that
if it's all with women,

00:50.789 --> 00:53.096

-Why can't we just
do the same thing?

I agree with that.

29.17 bottles of wine
to equal 70 beers. Okay.

08:24.982 --> 08:27.898
I know, but, uh, don't
get distracted by that, okay?

08:27.942 --> 08:30.031
The main reason I picked
an all-female flight

08:30.074 --> 08:31.989
is because sex
is how Dennis lost.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.817
Oh, Dennis? I-I like
to hear about Dennis.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.123
-Tell me more.
-[scoffs]

08:35.166 --> 08:37.604
He and Frank, he...
they made a side bet, you know.

08:37.647 --> 08:38.996
See who could have sex.

08:39.040 --> 08:41.433
And then Dennis ended up banging
this disgusting person,

08:41.477 --> 08:43.784
and then he got off
at North Dakota to avoid her.

08:43.827 --> 08:45.829
He was... [chuckles]
He was the first one out.

08:45.873 --> 08:49.616
So-so Dennis had sex on
the plane, how-how many women?

08:49.659 --> 08:51.705
-Just the one. Again...
-Hm...

08:51.748 --> 08:52.836
...don't get distracted by that.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.403
Well, I'm gonna beat his record.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.448
There's only one man
on this flight.

08:56.492 --> 08:58.189
Okay, well, I will
figure something out.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.801
No, no, no. Stop. Stop it, okay?
Kno-Knock it off.

09:00.844 --> 09:03.281
You're my Chris Evert.
You're my rival, okay?

09:03.325 --> 09:05.849
The only reason you're here
is so that my hatred of you

09:05.893 --> 09:08.939
can fuel my desire
to beat you, okay?

09:08.983 --> 09:10.637
So I need you staying
in the game.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.291
Okay. Then I'm gonna
beat you, you skank.

09:13.335 --> 09:15.642
-Yes. that is the spirit.
-[laughs]

09:15.685 --> 09:18.732
The only way to beat men is by
competing against other women.

09:18.775 --> 09:20.864
-[laughs]
-Here's to that.

Mm-mmm.

That's not alcohol.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.905

10:23.535 --> 10:24.711
-Don't do that.
-Huh? Yeah, no.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.930
I will do that.

Let's face it, I'm not gonna
find my Chris Evert

Deandra, you should have
let them crazy boys do this.

I'll be your Chris Evert.

16:50.270 --> 16:52.881
No, get out of here, Snail.
I don't respect you.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.100
Oh, yeah?
Well, respect this.

16:54.143 --> 16:56.145
I've been playing the game
the whole time.

16:56.189 --> 16:58.191
You're one behind me, loser.

I know it's over.

17:28.264 --> 17:29.526
'Cause I beat Martina.
