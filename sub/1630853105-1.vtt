00:28.922 --> 00:31.524
I don't know why I write this.

00:31.624 --> 00:32.624
I don't want to.

00:33.959 --> 00:35.728
I don't feel like I am able.

00:38.197 --> 00:39.732
It makes me so tired.

00:41.468 --> 00:45.070
But I must continue
on, at least for you.

04:04.169 --> 04:05.872
Please, dear, do something!

04:26.159 --> 04:27.159
Stop!

05:05.131 --> 05:06.899
- Sister.
- John.

05:06.999 --> 05:08.101
How was your journey?

05:08.201 --> 05:10.036
Long and uneventful.

05:10.136 --> 05:11.136
Thankfully.

05:22.380 --> 05:24.951
It is very seldom that
mere ordinary people,

05:25.051 --> 05:26.452
like John and myself,

05:26.552 --> 05:29.455
secure ancestral
halls for the summer.

05:29.555 --> 05:30.795
I would call it a haunted house

05:30.890 --> 05:33.526
and reach the height
of romantic Felicity.

05:33.626 --> 05:35.962
That would be asking
too much of me.

05:39.165 --> 05:40.767
Still, I will proudly declare

05:40.867 --> 05:42.735
that there is something
queer about it.

05:42.835 --> 05:45.438
Else, why should it
be let so cheaply?

05:45.538 --> 05:47.372
Here. Let me.

05:47.473 --> 05:49.142
John laughs at me, of course,

05:49.242 --> 05:51.043
but one expects
that in marriage.

05:52.011 --> 05:53.679
What do you think of it?

05:54.346 --> 05:55.681
Why, it's lovely.

06:00.119 --> 06:01.119
Who owns it?

06:02.588 --> 06:04.690
Right now, the court owns it.

06:07.994 --> 06:12.064
Two brothers are in dispute
over the hereditary paperwork.

06:15.234 --> 06:19.972
But, for the summer, it's ours.

06:34.386 --> 06:35.922
I love this drawing room.

06:37.223 --> 06:38.491
It is beautiful.

06:46.265 --> 06:47.633
Come.

06:47.733 --> 06:49.334
Let me show you the bedroom.

07:00.580 --> 07:02.648
What on earth was this room?

07:03.616 --> 07:05.585
It was a children's
nursery, I believe.

07:05.685 --> 07:07.587
The playroom when
they grew older.

07:10.523 --> 07:11.691
It's big and airy.

07:14.660 --> 07:17.797
With windows and
wonderful views.

07:17.897 --> 07:18.897
Come.

07:23.069 --> 07:25.872
You can see the gardens
and arboretum over here.

07:28.708 --> 07:30.009
And look at this view.

07:33.813 --> 07:38.217
If I'm correct, the sunrise
will shine in this window,

07:38.317 --> 07:40.152
and you can watch
it set through here.

07:45.324 --> 07:46.459
We can check the almanac

07:46.559 --> 07:48.361
and plot the exact
time if you like

07:48.461 --> 07:51.163
so we don't miss a
single, glorious sunset.

07:53.566 --> 07:56.535
There's something
strange about the house,

07:56.636 --> 07:58.403
but especially this room.

07:59.839 --> 08:01.974
Can we take one of
the rooms downstairs,

08:03.009 --> 08:05.945
the one that opens up to the
courtyard with the roses?

08:06.045 --> 08:08.547
There's only one window
there, and it's too small.

08:08.648 --> 08:10.182
This room is much better.

08:11.784 --> 08:12.417
But i-

08:12.518 --> 08:14.487
- this is the best room.

08:15.488 --> 08:17.223
We're finished downstairs.

08:17.323 --> 08:18.491
Of course.

08:19.825 --> 08:22.895
Doesn't something
feels strange to you?

09:19.819 --> 09:22.254
The doctor says it has
an agitating effect,

09:23.422 --> 09:25.257
but I do so enjoy a
glass with dinner.

09:26.726 --> 09:28.227
But of course, he's right.

10:21.414 --> 10:23.315
Goodnight, my love.

10:36.562 --> 10:40.166
John.

10:40.266 --> 10:41.266
John!

10:42.469 --> 10:43.469
What is it, my dear?

10:44.504 --> 10:46.906
Did you hear that?

10:47.006 --> 10:48.040
Hear what?

10:50.609 --> 10:51.610
That sound.

10:55.381 --> 10:56.381
Nevermind.

10:59.185 --> 11:00.185
Go to sleep.

12:00.614 --> 12:03.282
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

13:01.273 --> 13:02.341
No thank you.

13:04.944 --> 13:06.412
Well, hello, my pet.

13:06.513 --> 13:07.513
Good morning.

13:07.547 --> 13:08.547
Everything in order?

13:09.381 --> 13:12.619
So, what's my dear have
planned for the day?

13:12.718 --> 13:14.286
Don't worry. I'll be good.

13:14.386 --> 13:17.790
I think I'll do some exploring
and maybe work in the garden.

13:20.660 --> 13:21.660
I'm off to work.

13:23.663 --> 13:24.964
I'll be back for dinner.

13:25.064 --> 13:26.332
Do you want anything from town?

13:26.433 --> 13:29.603
Cigarettes and a newspaper.

13:29.703 --> 13:30.736
Sorry.

13:30.836 --> 13:33.506
I think we have
everything we need.

13:34.674 --> 13:37.343
Remember, your exercise depends
on your strength, my dear,

13:37.444 --> 13:39.745
and your food somewhat
on your appetite,

13:39.845 --> 13:42.014
but the air...

13:42.114 --> 13:44.216
The air, you can
relish all the time.

13:47.454 --> 13:50.490
Remember, she's not to do
more than an hour of chores.

13:50.590 --> 13:52.958
And, please, no writing.

13:53.058 --> 13:55.327
However talented she may
be, her talents as a mother

13:55.428 --> 13:57.497
are considerably more
important these days.

13:57.597 --> 13:59.566
Of course.

13:59.666 --> 14:01.367
I'll see you this evening.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.084
Jane!

17:49.027 --> 17:49.896
Hello.

17:49.995 --> 17:51.898
How was your walk?

17:51.997 --> 17:53.131
It was lovely.

17:59.404 --> 18:01.708
Would you like to hold him?

18:05.778 --> 18:06.778
All right.

18:23.128 --> 18:24.162
Shh, shh.

18:24.998 --> 18:25.998
Here.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.101
John will be home soon.

18:29.201 --> 18:31.738
Why don't you go upstairs
and dress for dinner.

18:32.772 --> 18:35.374
I'll take him inside, and
we'll have Mary feed him.

18:36.709 --> 18:37.744
Thank you.

19:39.171 --> 19:40.171
Come in.

19:48.047 --> 19:49.882
How was your day, dear?

19:50.917 --> 19:51.918
It was wonderful.

19:52.018 --> 19:54.419
I explored the gardens.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.656
I took a long walk
down to the bay.

19:56.756 --> 20:00.059
Even the broken old
greenhouse was inspiring.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.861
Sounds very lovely.

20:01.961 --> 20:03.763
It was a glorious day.

20:03.863 --> 20:05.465
I wish they were all like this.

20:06.966 --> 20:07.966
How was your day?

20:09.035 --> 20:10.737
Two cases of poison Ivy,

20:10.837 --> 20:13.506
a young boy who broke
his leg climbing a tree,

20:13.606 --> 20:15.708
an old woman who
accidentally poked her eye

20:15.808 --> 20:16.843
with a sewing needle.

20:16.943 --> 20:18.911
Oof.

20:19.946 --> 20:22.982
Any other cases?

20:23.082 --> 20:24.917
Such as social diseases?

20:25.952 --> 20:26.952
No.

20:28.955 --> 20:31.024
No, I mean...

20:31.124 --> 20:33.693
Any cases like mine?

20:33.793 --> 20:37.229
My dear, how many
times have I got to tell you?

20:37.329 --> 20:38.464
I just thought that,

20:38.564 --> 20:39.875
with all the other
people in the office,

20:39.899 --> 20:42.735
there would be some sort
of research or something.

20:42.835 --> 20:44.070
Please, listen to me.

20:44.169 --> 20:46.639
The worst thing you can
do is think about it.

20:48.741 --> 20:50.009
Take today for instance.

20:50.109 --> 20:51.911
You had a wonderful day.

20:52.011 --> 20:54.147
You took a walk, held a baby.

20:54.246 --> 20:56.415
This place is already
doing you good.

20:58.084 --> 20:59.519
Yes.

20:59.619 --> 21:00.619
I know.

21:01.554 --> 21:03.756
Why don't you go
upstairs and get ready for bed.

21:03.856 --> 21:05.024
I have some more work to do,

21:05.124 --> 21:07.192
and then I will
be up to join you.

21:10.763 --> 21:11.763
All right.

21:29.182 --> 21:30.683
We have been here two weeks,

21:30.783 --> 21:32.919
and I haven't felt
like writing before,

21:33.019 --> 21:34.721
not since that first day.

21:35.988 --> 21:39.459
I'm sitting by the window now,
up in this atrocious nursery,

21:39.559 --> 21:41.194
and there is nothing
to hinder my writing

21:41.293 --> 21:43.996
as much as I please,
save lack of strength.

21:45.330 --> 21:47.967
John is away all day,
and even some nights,

21:48.067 --> 21:50.268
when his cases are serious.

21:50.368 --> 21:52.905
I'm glad my case is not serious,

21:53.005 --> 21:56.008
but these nervous troubles
are dreadfully depressing.

21:56.909 --> 21:59.846
John does not know how
much I really suffer.

21:59.946 --> 22:02.115
He knows there is
no reason to suffer,

22:02.215 --> 22:03.750
and that satisfies him.

22:06.486 --> 22:08.020
Of course, it is
only nervousness.

22:09.155 --> 22:10.155
It does weigh on me.

22:17.997 --> 22:18.997
Good morning.

22:19.065 --> 22:21.134
Aren't you hungry?

22:21.234 --> 22:22.234
You need to eat.

22:22.267 --> 22:24.302
And take my medication?

22:24.402 --> 22:27.006
I just promised John
I'd make sure you did.

22:29.108 --> 22:31.144
He cares for you so much

22:31.244 --> 22:33.613
and truly wants to
see you get better.

22:33.713 --> 22:36.314
Except he doesn't think
there's anything wrong with me.

22:36.414 --> 22:38.451
- Well...
- You see it.

22:39.185 --> 22:40.453
He thinks I'm sad.

22:40.553 --> 22:41.821
Just a little bluebird.

22:43.856 --> 22:44.856
What a poet.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.394
Sometimes I think he's right,

22:49.495 --> 22:51.363
there isn't really
anything wrong.

22:52.632 --> 22:55.835
And other times I feel as sick
and tired as this old house.

22:57.537 --> 22:58.738
I hate to be been ungrateful.

22:58.838 --> 23:01.306
We all just want
to see you happy,

23:01.406 --> 23:04.076
and better, and writing again.

23:05.211 --> 23:07.013
I doubt John feels that way.

23:08.114 --> 23:12.084
He thinks it's nonsense and
likely the cause of my problems.

23:13.252 --> 23:15.721
He loves you so much

23:15.822 --> 23:18.758
and is truly dedicated to
giving you the best care.

23:19.792 --> 23:20.993
We all love you.

23:26.833 --> 23:27.833
I know.

24:57.023 --> 24:58.023
Thank you.

25:08.301 --> 25:10.269
Such a glorious day.

25:10.369 --> 25:11.369
So lovely here.

25:24.317 --> 25:25.685
Is anything the matter?

25:27.887 --> 25:28.887
Fine.

25:30.656 --> 25:32.959
But I think all laid
down for a moment.

26:17.336 --> 26:18.504
Thank you.

26:18.604 --> 26:20.272
Let me know
if you need anything.

26:20.373 --> 26:21.941
I'll be right downstairs.

26:40.960 --> 26:43.329
Mary is so good with the baby,

26:43.430 --> 26:46.132
and yet I could not be with him.

26:46.232 --> 26:48.067
He makes me so nervous.

26:48.167 --> 26:50.903
I suppose John was never
nervous in his life.

26:51.837 --> 26:53.440
This paper looks
to me as if it knew

26:53.539 --> 26:56.042
what a vicious influence it had.

26:56.142 --> 26:59.578
It makes me so tired and
scares me for some reason.

27:00.514 --> 27:02.214
I'm starting to
think it's haunted.

27:09.755 --> 27:10.823
How are you?

27:14.360 --> 27:15.594
Easy, easy.

27:17.963 --> 27:20.332
I need to go downstairs.

27:20.434 --> 27:21.600
Shh. It's all right.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.002
It's not all right.

27:24.504 --> 27:26.305
This room is so foreboding.

27:28.508 --> 27:29.675
Can you feel it?

27:31.577 --> 27:34.080
It just saps all my energy.

27:34.180 --> 27:36.816
You know, this place
is doing you really good.

27:36.916 --> 27:39.351
The gardens are,
but not this room.

27:40.653 --> 27:42.955
And most definitely
not the wallpaper.

27:44.223 --> 27:47.359
Couldn't we repaper
it or paint it over?

27:48.360 --> 27:50.262
Dear, I don't
care to renovate the house

27:50.362 --> 27:51.931
just for a three months rental.

27:53.065 --> 27:55.067
Then do let us go downstairs.

27:55.968 --> 27:57.670
The rooms there are so pretty.

27:58.572 --> 28:00.139
Oh, my blessed little goose,

28:00.239 --> 28:02.208
we can go down to the
cellar if you wish,

28:02.308 --> 28:04.710
and I'll have it whitewashed to.

28:04.810 --> 28:07.079
There's something
wrong with this room.

28:08.314 --> 28:10.149
You can't let those
talks get a better of you.

28:10.249 --> 28:12.885
As soon as we change the
paper, it will be the door

28:12.985 --> 28:16.088
and then have you bedstead
and the barred windows.

28:17.256 --> 28:18.733
There's nothing worse
for a nervous patient

28:18.757 --> 28:21.060
that to give way to
these sort of fancies.

28:24.498 --> 28:26.232
Are you staying here tonight?

28:27.199 --> 28:29.635
I have to go back to the clinic.

28:29.735 --> 28:31.655
There are two very sick
people I have to check on

28:31.704 --> 28:33.305
and a case to research.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.476
If I get done early,
I'll come back,

28:36.576 --> 28:39.278
but it's likely I'll have to stay.

28:40.279 --> 28:43.048
I just feel so much
better when you're here

28:44.083 --> 28:46.553
and so much worse
when you're away.

28:46.652 --> 28:49.388
Oh, my sweet little girl.

28:50.356 --> 28:52.424
You know I wish I could
be here all the time.

28:53.359 --> 28:56.395
We have to pay for this
house and the repairs.

28:56.496 --> 28:58.030
How can I not take
these patients?

28:58.130 --> 28:59.130
I know.

28:59.698 --> 29:00.866
I'm sorry.

29:00.966 --> 29:02.435
Shh. It's all right.

29:03.802 --> 29:05.004
Get some rest.

29:06.005 --> 29:08.040
And I'll send jennie
up with your dinner.

29:09.643 --> 29:10.843
Thank you.

34:07.039 --> 34:08.240
Are you all right?

34:11.611 --> 34:14.112
You've been in here all
afternoon and evening.

34:17.684 --> 34:20.185
I had such a beautiful
dream last night.

34:22.154 --> 34:23.422
May I tell it to you.

34:25.123 --> 34:26.158
Of course.

34:27.326 --> 34:29.228
It is the story of a composer

34:30.229 --> 34:32.432
who comes to a house
much like this one.

34:33.833 --> 34:35.768
He comes to write a symphony.

34:37.302 --> 34:40.072
But the house is
haunted by a woman.

34:41.741 --> 34:45.445
Yes, an apparition who
used to be a dancer.

34:47.079 --> 34:49.281
She falls in love with his music

34:49.381 --> 34:52.050
and begins to dance
as he plays the piano,

34:53.085 --> 34:56.154
which inspires more
and more music,

34:57.256 --> 34:59.792
music almost as
beautiful as her dancing.

35:01.995 --> 35:04.597
The beauty of their
art forms combine

35:04.697 --> 35:06.298
and propel one another.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.603
Over time, he becomes stronger.

35:11.771 --> 35:14.607
And over time, she begins
to weaken and fade.

35:16.676 --> 35:18.478
He starts to notice this,

35:19.445 --> 35:22.615
and he starts to play
quieter and slower,

35:22.715 --> 35:27.286
quieter and slower, until
you can barely hear a sound,

35:28.655 --> 35:31.824
trying to keep her dancing
for as long as she can.

35:34.027 --> 35:35.828
And as the piece
comes to an end...

35:37.362 --> 35:40.033
On that last note,
which he tries to hold

35:40.132 --> 35:42.835
for as long as he
possibly can...

35:44.938 --> 35:46.204
In that very moment...

35:47.907 --> 35:48.907
Whoosh...

35:51.010 --> 35:52.545
Her light extinguishes...

35:53.947 --> 35:56.148
And she disappears, forever.

37:41.319 --> 37:42.922
Are you finished?

37:43.890 --> 37:45.892
Yes. I think I'll turn in.

37:45.992 --> 37:48.193
Would you like
me to check in on you

37:48.293 --> 37:49.962
after I finish tidying up?

37:51.329 --> 37:53.365
No, thank you. I'll be fine.

45:00.159 --> 45:01.260
My lord!

45:03.896 --> 45:04.997
Are you all right?

45:06.232 --> 45:08.701
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

45:08.801 --> 45:10.136
I may have.

45:11.704 --> 45:14.807
John is downstairs
getting ready for dinner.

45:15.908 --> 45:18.410
Good. I'll be down in a minute.

45:42.101 --> 45:43.335
There he is.

45:43.436 --> 45:44.437
How I've missed you.

45:46.473 --> 45:47.973
I've missed you as well.

45:52.711 --> 45:54.213
Is everything all right?

45:56.115 --> 45:57.983
I was about to ask you the same.

45:59.351 --> 46:01.320
Well, you've been
gone for three days-

46:01.420 --> 46:02.420
- two.

46:03.590 --> 46:04.790
All right, two.

46:04.890 --> 46:06.859
I thought we had
an understanding.

46:07.793 --> 46:09.995
An understanding?

46:10.095 --> 46:11.130
About what?

46:13.933 --> 46:15.100
I think he knows.

46:17.136 --> 46:18.971
When did you
start writing again?

46:21.508 --> 46:22.508
We had an agreement.

46:24.544 --> 46:25.544
An agreement?

46:27.112 --> 46:30.115
We're all here for you, my dear.

46:30.216 --> 46:31.383
For me?

46:31.484 --> 46:35.254
You've been gone, and
I've been here all alone.

46:35.354 --> 46:37.457
Sweetheart, you know
I have to take care

46:37.557 --> 46:38.924
of the patients in town.

46:39.024 --> 46:41.894
And you have jennie here to
take care of you when I'm gone.

46:41.994 --> 46:44.029
And this beautiful house.

46:44.129 --> 46:45.397
The gardens.

46:45.498 --> 46:48.200
I know, of course, your work
is important, but there-

47:19.499 --> 47:20.500
Dear James,

47:21.534 --> 47:24.504
I'm writing this letter to you
regarding your sister, Jane.

47:25.472 --> 47:28.007
She's requested that
you come for a visit,

47:28.107 --> 47:29.542
and, given the circumstances,

47:29.643 --> 47:31.544
I agree that it may be helpful.

47:32.811 --> 47:35.347
I know this is difficult news,

47:35.448 --> 47:38.083
but I fear Jane's
condition isn't improving

47:38.183 --> 47:40.553
and she's not taking
the treatment seriously.

47:42.388 --> 47:44.890
I'm not sure she
understands what's at stake:

47:45.958 --> 47:49.496
Our family, not to
mention her own wellbeing.

47:51.665 --> 47:52.841
I've been more than reasonable,

47:52.865 --> 47:55.568
but what I am now at
the end of my resources.

47:57.136 --> 48:00.306
I may have no choice but to
check her into the institution.

48:01.373 --> 48:03.643
It may be that, if
she hears from you,

48:03.743 --> 48:06.312
another physician
and her brother,

48:06.412 --> 48:09.482
she may acquiesce and
give a real effort.

48:10.784 --> 48:13.787
With this, I hope
that you can visit

48:13.886 --> 48:16.188
at your earliest opportunity.

48:16.288 --> 48:19.592
Sincerely, your
brother-in-law, John.

49:21.821 --> 49:23.122
There, there.

49:25.190 --> 49:26.892
How are you, sister?

49:28.728 --> 49:29.895
So tired.

49:30.730 --> 49:32.465
My body feels so weak.

49:33.500 --> 49:34.500
I know.

49:42.274 --> 49:45.310
We're gonna try some different
medications and dosages,

49:45.411 --> 49:48.481
help you relax, sleep
better and rest.

49:50.315 --> 49:51.527
I think we're
going to have to limit

49:51.551 --> 49:52.452
your work in the garden

49:52.552 --> 49:54.953
until you're feeling
a little better.

49:55.053 --> 49:57.557
I'm sure it'll
be just a couple of days.

49:58.558 --> 50:03.028
If you can clear your
head and get some rest...

50:03.128 --> 50:04.997
You'll be on your
way in no time.

50:28.053 --> 50:29.087
That's it.

52:37.951 --> 52:39.251
How is she?

52:42.055 --> 52:43.055
Better.

52:43.957 --> 52:45.390
Just needs more rest.

52:48.360 --> 52:50.496
We need to keep her
in bed, I'm afraid.

55:17.110 --> 55:19.311
They're beautiful, aren't they?

55:26.119 --> 55:28.253
I had another vivid dream.

55:30.022 --> 55:35.027
I'm lying on the ground,
tangled in these vines.

55:36.129 --> 55:39.465
They wrap around me in all
sorts of terrible ways.

55:42.267 --> 55:44.737
Poking me and prodding me.

55:46.105 --> 55:48.273
They get tighter and tighter

55:48.373 --> 55:51.778
until they pull me
down into the dirt.

55:52.812 --> 55:55.748
I cry out as loud as
I can for John's help.

55:57.016 --> 56:00.385
When he finally arrives, I
plead with him to help me.

56:01.621 --> 56:06.826
He just sits and watches with
that stern look on his face.

56:08.694 --> 56:12.932
He reaches down towards me,
but instead of helping me,

56:13.032 --> 56:17.069
he pushes me down further,
until I'm drowning in the dirt.

56:19.172 --> 56:24.577
I flail around and around,
but eventually it goes dark.

56:29.248 --> 56:31.984
I just don't understand.

56:37.890 --> 56:39.826
John says, if I
don't pick up faster,

56:39.926 --> 56:42.094
he'll send me to Weir
Mitchell in the fall.

56:43.496 --> 56:45.464
I don't want to go there.

56:45.565 --> 56:47.834
I had a friend who
was in his care once.

56:49.101 --> 56:53.706
She said he's just like John
and my brother, only worse.

56:56.843 --> 57:01.514
Besides, it is such an
undertaking to go so far.

57:36.916 --> 57:38.985
I'll get you something to drink.

1:00:00.860 --> 1:00:03.062
The lingering smell is horrid.

1:00:03.963 --> 1:00:06.265
I remember it from
when we first moved in,

1:00:06.365 --> 1:00:08.034
but it was much weaker then,

1:00:08.134 --> 1:00:10.870
especially with the open
windows and fresh breeze.

1:00:11.804 --> 1:00:14.106
Now, we have had a
week of fog and rain,

1:00:14.206 --> 1:00:17.543
and whether the windows are
open and not, the smell is here.

1:00:18.411 --> 1:00:20.079
It gets into my hair.

1:00:20.179 --> 1:00:23.315
I wake up in the night and
find it hanging over me.

1:02:38.017 --> 1:02:40.152
It is the strangest yellow.

1:02:41.420 --> 1:02:44.990
It makes me think of all the
yellow things I ever saw.

1:02:46.292 --> 1:02:49.862
Not beautiful ones,
like buttercups,

1:02:49.962 --> 1:02:53.365
but all foul, bad yellow things.

1:02:54.266 --> 1:02:55.334
Like this smell.

1:02:56.603 --> 1:02:58.270
An awful yellow smell.

1:02:59.805 --> 1:03:01.240
But I'm used to it now.

1:03:14.220 --> 1:03:15.220
Jane?

1:03:18.692 --> 1:03:19.725
Jane?

1:03:22.662 --> 1:03:23.662
Wake up, Jane.

1:03:25.532 --> 1:03:26.532
Jane.

1:03:30.437 --> 1:03:31.504
Are you all right.

1:03:34.073 --> 1:03:35.808
How did you get so dirty?

1:03:39.144 --> 1:03:40.144
Jane.

1:03:41.947 --> 1:03:43.516
The pattern does move.

1:03:45.217 --> 1:03:46.217
No wonder.

1:03:47.687 --> 1:03:50.389
The woman behind
the wallpaper shakes it.

1:03:53.192 --> 1:03:54.192
Good lord.

1:03:55.462 --> 1:03:56.463
I'll get John.

1:04:28.827 --> 1:04:30.563
It's a horrid smell.

1:04:32.732 --> 1:04:33.732
So foul.

1:04:39.004 --> 1:04:41.240
It's coming from the
wallpaper, you know.

1:04:44.611 --> 1:04:47.846
We should burn this
house down to the ground.

1:14:41.474 --> 1:14:43.042
What are you doing?

1:14:43.142 --> 1:14:44.142
Good lord!

1:14:44.610 --> 1:14:46.078
Why would you frighten me?

1:14:50.249 --> 1:14:53.252
That paper is just awful.

1:14:53.352 --> 1:14:55.187
It stains everything it touches.

1:14:56.322 --> 1:14:59.191
All your clothing
is yellow smudges.

1:14:59.292 --> 1:15:01.961
John's too. It's
impossible to clean.

1:15:03.029 --> 1:15:05.197
I really wish you'd
be more careful.

1:17:58.871 --> 1:18:00.372
Are you all right in there?

1:18:03.577 --> 1:18:04.577
Jane?

1:18:05.512 --> 1:18:07.079
Why is the door locked?

1:18:08.482 --> 1:18:10.316
Everything's fine.

1:18:10.416 --> 1:18:11.684
I'm just resting.

1:18:13.553 --> 1:18:15.321
Can I get you anything?

1:18:15.421 --> 1:18:16.622
No, thank you.

1:18:46.218 --> 1:18:47.218
How was your day?

1:18:49.523 --> 1:18:51.891
Same as always: Uneventful.

1:18:53.627 --> 1:18:55.094
And how are you feeling?

1:18:55.194 --> 1:18:57.396
A bit better. How
are you feeling?

1:18:59.566 --> 1:19:00.866
I meant how is work?

1:19:02.569 --> 1:19:03.569
Splendid.

1:19:05.271 --> 1:19:07.173
Things have calmed down.

1:19:08.807 --> 1:19:11.277
But I'm most concerned
about you, of course.

1:19:16.882 --> 1:19:18.884
Did you go for a walk today?

1:19:18.984 --> 1:19:20.453
The gardens are beautiful.

1:19:21.621 --> 1:19:26.091
Maybe tomorrow. I
was so tired today.

1:19:26.192 --> 1:19:27.259
You should.

1:19:28.461 --> 1:19:31.096
A little bit of fresh
air will do some good.

1:19:36.536 --> 1:19:37.637
You're right.

1:19:37.736 --> 1:19:39.905
I'll spend some time in
the gardens tomorrow.

1:19:41.541 --> 1:19:42.541
Goodnight.

1:19:47.379 --> 1:19:48.981
Sleep well, love.

1:24:09.742 --> 1:24:11.243
I've seen her.

1:24:11.343 --> 1:24:14.447
I can see her out of
every one of my windows.

1:24:14.547 --> 1:24:18.451
It is the same woman, I know,
for she is always creeping,

1:24:18.551 --> 1:24:21.353
and most women do not
creep by daylight.

1:24:21.454 --> 1:24:23.890
I see her on that long
road, under the trees,

1:24:23.989 --> 1:24:25.592
creeping along.

1:24:25.692 --> 1:24:26.826
And when a carriage comes,

1:24:26.926 --> 1:24:29.596
she hides under the
BlackBerry vines.

1:24:29.696 --> 1:24:31.263
I don't blame her a bit.

1:24:31.363 --> 1:24:32.799
It must be very humiliating

1:24:32.899 --> 1:24:34.601
to be caught
creeping by daylight.

1:24:35.602 --> 1:24:38.638
I always lock the door
when I creep by daylight.

1:24:38.738 --> 1:24:39.739
I can't do it at night,

1:24:39.839 --> 1:24:42.407
for I know John would
suspect something at once.

1:28:34.173 --> 1:28:36.008
Oh, my lord!

1:28:36.109 --> 1:28:37.109
Jane!

1:28:38.578 --> 1:28:41.279
I did it out of pure
spite at the vicious thing.

1:28:42.448 --> 1:28:46.251
I must admit, I wouldn't
mind doing some of that myself.

1:28:46.351 --> 1:28:48.420
I'm sure it's quite therapeutic.

1:28:49.287 --> 1:28:51.491
But Jane, you mustn't
get too tired.

1:28:52.390 --> 1:28:54.093
Why don't you come downstairs

1:28:54.193 --> 1:28:57.029
and spend your last day with us?

1:28:57.130 --> 1:28:58.931
You could take a
walk in the garden.

1:29:00.566 --> 1:29:03.035
It's so quiet and empty up here.

1:29:04.003 --> 1:29:05.403
I think I'll lay down again.

1:29:06.172 --> 1:29:07.874
Get as much sleep as I can.

1:29:07.974 --> 1:29:11.043
But Jane, you really could
do with some fresh air.

1:29:11.878 --> 1:29:15.815
Please don't wake me
up, not even for dinner.

1:29:15.915 --> 1:29:17.083
But-

1:29:17.183 --> 1:29:18.017
- I'll come down when I wake.

1:29:18.117 --> 1:29:21.854
John will be home soon!

1:29:23.790 --> 1:29:24.790
Jane?

1:34:41.575 --> 1:34:42.374
Jane?

1:34:42.476 --> 1:34:44.343
Please, Jane, open the door.

1:34:45.644 --> 1:34:48.347
John is coming home.
He loves you so much.

1:34:48.448 --> 1:34:51.717
My darling John?

1:34:51.817 --> 1:34:53.119
He'll see soon enough.

1:35:00.594 --> 1:35:03.295
I peeled off all
the paper I could...

1:35:03.395 --> 1:35:05.164
Standing on the floor.

1:35:06.298 --> 1:35:07.633
It sticks terribly...

1:35:08.435 --> 1:35:10.402
And the pattern just enjoys it.

1:35:12.037 --> 1:35:15.074
Those bulbous heads
and strangling eyes...

1:35:15.174 --> 1:35:19.145
And fungus growths just
shriek with derision.

1:35:19.245 --> 1:35:20.980
And I'm getting angry.

1:35:36.962 --> 1:35:41.267
I have a rope up here that
not jennie could find.

1:35:42.234 --> 1:35:44.604
So if that woman does
get out of the wallpaper

1:35:44.703 --> 1:35:46.439
and tries to escape.

1:35:53.580 --> 1:35:55.515
I don't want anyone to come in,

1:35:55.615 --> 1:35:57.450
and I don't want
to have to go out,

1:35:57.551 --> 1:35:58.984
not till John comes.

1:36:30.282 --> 1:36:35.488
I forgot I could not reach far
without anything to stand on.

1:36:36.355 --> 1:36:37.435
And this bed will not move.

1:36:55.207 --> 1:36:56.375
Jane!

1:36:58.511 --> 1:37:00.647
It's no use, young man!

1:37:00.746 --> 1:37:02.281
You can't come in!

1:37:02.381 --> 1:37:04.551
Open the door, my darling.

1:37:04.651 --> 1:37:06.453
How he calls and pounds.

1:37:07.786 --> 1:37:10.222
It would be a shame to
break down that door!

1:37:13.727 --> 1:37:15.127
Open the door!

1:37:15.227 --> 1:37:16.428
I can't.

1:37:16.529 --> 1:37:19.932
The key is downstairs by the
front door in the planter.

1:37:20.032 --> 1:37:21.501
Open the door!

1:37:21.601 --> 1:37:23.002
I can't!

1:37:23.102 --> 1:37:26.539
The key is downstairs by the
front door in the planter.

1:37:28.642 --> 1:37:29.642
Jennie!

1:37:31.745 --> 1:37:33.446
Get me an ax!

1:37:33.546 --> 1:37:35.948
Now he's calling for an ax.

1:38:32.672 --> 1:38:34.607
"What is the matter?" He cried.

1:38:35.475 --> 1:38:38.210
"For god's sake,
what are you doing?"

1:38:40.079 --> 1:38:42.414
I kept on creeping
just the same.

1:38:43.382 --> 1:38:46.051
I looked at him from
over my shoulder.

1:38:46.151 --> 1:38:49.888
"I've got out at last in
spite of you and Jane,

1:38:49.988 --> 1:38:51.591
and I've pulled
most of the paper,

1:38:51.691 --> 1:38:53.626
so that you can't put me back."

1:38:55.060 --> 1:38:59.031
Now, why should that
man fainted? But he did.

1:38:59.131 --> 1:39:01.468
And right across my
path, by the wall,

1:39:02.435 --> 1:39:04.637
so that I had to creep
over him every time,

1:39:06.506 --> 1:39:07.640
again...

1:39:07.741 --> 1:39:09.509
And again...

1:39:09.609 --> 1:39:10.643
And again...

1:39:11.578 --> 1:39:12.578
And again.
