WEBVTT

00:09.710 --> 00:13.445
MICHAEL: It is very sobering,
pondering what it is like for

00:13.481 --> 00:18.183
somebody to freeze to death,
and how easy it is.

00:21.222 --> 00:25.491
I could count personally, nine
or ten people that I care about,

00:25.526 --> 00:29.328
who were killed by this
environment here in Alaska.

00:30.431 --> 00:33.632
And so, there are certain
things that I try to do to

00:33.667 --> 00:38.470
prepare for the dire situation
in below-zero weather.

00:38.506 --> 00:42.174
And one of them is
survival training.

00:43.711 --> 00:46.311
But when you're out
here and it's below zero,

00:46.347 --> 00:49.114
it's not a practice run.

00:49.183 --> 00:52.618
I have to figure
out how to survive.

00:59.427 --> 01:00.859
All right.

01:00.895 --> 01:04.396
We got about a 30-mile an hour
wind on this no-name river.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.734
This is survival training.

01:09.370 --> 01:13.639
I was trained at the
Black Rapids Northern
Warfare Training Center

01:13.674 --> 01:17.076
for mountaineering and
cold weather survival.

01:17.111 --> 01:20.312
But things change a little bit
when you don't have all that

01:20.347 --> 01:23.882
military equipment
that you were issued.

01:23.918 --> 01:26.218
<i>NARRATOR: For Michael Manzo,</i>
<i>having the skills to endure</i>

01:26.253 --> 01:31.023
<i>the cold and lonely Alaska</i>
<i>wilderness is a matter</i>
<i>of life or death.</i>

01:31.058 --> 01:33.692
<i>But even though this</i>
<i>was a planned exercise,</i>

01:33.727 --> 01:36.628
<i>an oncoming storm could</i>
<i>quickly turn his test into a</i>

01:36.664 --> 01:39.598
<i>real world fight for survival.</i>

01:39.633 --> 01:41.834
MICHAEL: This happens
all the time in Alaska.

01:41.869 --> 01:45.737
The river hasn't quite
solidified like it would this

01:45.773 --> 01:49.208
time of the year
because of climate change.

01:49.243 --> 01:53.679
And so, you have
a sled go down,
a snow machine.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.881
It broke through
the ice so fast,

01:55.916 --> 01:58.517
couldn't recover nothing.

01:58.552 --> 02:03.922
You're many, many, many
miles away from your home.

02:03.958 --> 02:06.825
Walking out is the wrong idea.

02:06.860 --> 02:11.497
You gotta hunker down, you're
waiting on people to find you

02:11.532 --> 02:15.033
based off your trip report.

02:15.069 --> 02:19.638
If I'm two days overdue,
please come help.

02:21.542 --> 02:25.310
So, two days before they
realize you're missing,

02:25.346 --> 02:30.382
if the weather cooperates,
two days for authorities
to come looking for you.

02:31.619 --> 02:34.686
You add those days up.

02:34.722 --> 02:41.126
Four days to survive the
below-zero weather with
what's in your pockets.

02:43.197 --> 02:45.931
And so, it begins.

02:48.736 --> 02:52.604
JESSI: There's just so many
things that I absolutely
rely on in the city.

02:52.640 --> 02:56.708
And being out here, I
rely on my own two hands.

02:57.878 --> 03:00.612
And that's pure
freedom for me.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.621
Well, dang.

03:10.624 --> 03:13.392
That's one empty snare.

03:13.761 --> 03:16.962
And nothing's come
through here in a
couple days, for sure.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.830
It's been snowing and
there's no new tracks,

03:18.866 --> 03:22.534
so I think I'm just gonna
take this guy down.

03:25.206 --> 03:28.407
Something that I spend a lot of
time out here doing is just

03:28.442 --> 03:31.510
setting traps and
just following tracks.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.413
But there is no
tracks around the cabin.

03:34.448 --> 03:37.149
I'm looking, like,
I've been out.

03:37.184 --> 03:42.788
This guy is right there,
he hasn't been touched,

03:42.823 --> 03:46.358
so I'm gonna just leave that
there and go find the next one.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.028
It's a big deal to get
fresh meat out here,

03:50.064 --> 03:53.632
to be able to sustain
our bodies and to be
able to live out here.

03:53.667 --> 03:57.569
Ah, damn. Nothing.

03:57.605 --> 04:00.305
Last year I had one
spot that I was trapping,

04:00.341 --> 04:03.275
but this year it's proving to
be a little bit more difficult.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.878
Nothing yet.

04:06.914 --> 04:11.350
I'd really like to have
a cabin wherever I'm
putting my trap line,

04:11.385 --> 04:13.719
but my trap line moves.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.288
So, I'd like my cabin to move.

04:16.323 --> 04:19.424
Like a micro-trapping cabin.

04:22.396 --> 04:27.566
All right, so it's going to be
taller than it is wide, right?

04:27.601 --> 04:29.501
CHRIS: I'm guessing, I
haven't measured yet,

04:29.536 --> 04:33.538
but I'm guessing our trail is
no more than four feet wide.

04:33.574 --> 04:37.409
And then it's gotta be long
enough that we can lay down in

04:37.444 --> 04:39.244
it and have a
wood stove in it,

04:39.280 --> 04:42.881
so it's gotta be
like eight feet long.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.117
Jessi really wants
to push out farther,

04:45.152 --> 04:48.253
and if we had a portable cabin
that could actually move from

04:48.289 --> 04:49.988
trapping area to
trapping area,

04:50.024 --> 04:52.658
this would just
be a game-changer.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.559
JESSI: And then
we got the skis.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.161
Okay.

04:56.196 --> 04:58.263
What do you wanna start with?

04:59.400 --> 05:01.133
CHRIS: The first thing I'd like
to do is just measure the trail,

05:01.168 --> 05:04.603
see how much we have to cut
down to make this feasible.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.972
Hey!

05:09.109 --> 05:11.310
Oh, that looks really tiny.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.611
JESSI: Yeah.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.414
CHRIS: Um, so
that's four-foot-six.

05:15.449 --> 05:18.183
Can we fit in this?

05:18.218 --> 05:19.318
Okay.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.453
Ooh, she's gonna
be a tight bed.

05:22.056 --> 05:25.957
All right, let's
walk our trail.

05:26.894 --> 05:29.494
As I'm walking along holding
up the stick nice and high as

05:29.530 --> 05:32.297
I am as wide, if not
wider, than the building.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.399
So, if I can fit
through the trail,

05:34.435 --> 05:36.635
the building can fit
through the trail.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.403
JESSI: Close.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.038
Definitely gonna have
to take that one out.

05:40.074 --> 05:42.040
CHRIS: Okay.
Let me see about these two.

05:42.076 --> 05:44.209
JESSI: Yeah, I think we're
gonna have to get those,

05:44.244 --> 05:47.679
the birch, and
this spruce for sure.

05:47.715 --> 05:51.416
CHRIS: Watch out.
JESSI: We got a lot to do.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.719
CHRIS: Oh, yeah.

05:57.491 --> 06:01.126
JOHNNY: This is one of
the most far removed places
that I could possibly find.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.729
There's no boundaries,
there's no, there's no limits.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.197
It's freedom out here.

06:05.232 --> 06:07.299
I think, ultimately,
that's what we're all after,
is freedom.

06:21.682 --> 06:24.616
It, it's feeling
pretty thawed back here.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.418
You know, I won't know if
the brain is thawed until

06:26.453 --> 06:29.254
I actually cut it
open but, yeah.

06:29.289 --> 06:32.958
The mouth has movement,
it's pretty malleable.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.928
The Arctic is an unforgiving
place in the winter.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.364
Java and I both are
experiencing temperatures

06:39.400 --> 06:41.266
we've never felt before.

06:41.301 --> 06:43.869
And Java is not
Arctic-friendly naturally.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.405
And I can see that
she's starting to
struggle with the cold.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.173
So, I'm gonna use a caribou
hide to make her some

06:48.208 --> 06:50.542
booties and a parka.

06:52.679 --> 06:55.347
I think I'm gonna utilize the
brains from the hide to tan it.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.516
It's something I've
never done before.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.751
This will all be new to me.

06:59.787 --> 07:04.389
But it's something we've
been doing as people
for thousands of years.

07:04.425 --> 07:08.193
Tanning the hides
with the brains.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.429
What do you say, Java?

07:10.464 --> 07:12.798
I think it would be
disrespectful to use just

07:12.833 --> 07:15.133
selective parts of an animal.

07:15.169 --> 07:16.802
Some people kill
just for the meat,

07:16.837 --> 07:19.337
but I think you can dive in
and get creative and use

07:19.373 --> 07:21.540
a lot more than that.

07:21.575 --> 07:24.709
We're not running around
just trying to kill
everything that we see.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.478
Cool. So, the hide's off.

07:26.513 --> 07:28.280
That's not the way
it works out here.

07:28.315 --> 07:31.349
That's a fast way to
get rejected by nature.

07:32.653 --> 07:35.854
Never done this before,
but that's the joy.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.489
Always be doing something new.

07:37.524 --> 07:42.494
I don't like to repeat
things over and over again.

07:42.529 --> 07:45.163
It's the curiosity that
keeps me going out here.

07:45.199 --> 07:47.766
I'm learning new
things always.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.468
That's all the brain.

07:49.503 --> 07:51.169
I just need to boil this.

07:51.205 --> 07:52.871
I'm gonna boil this
for a couple hours,

07:52.906 --> 07:56.174
and it'll make a paste, kinda
like mayonnaise consistency.

07:56.210 --> 07:59.244
And that's what I'll
use to rub into the hide.

08:03.383 --> 08:06.318
Like a witch's stew out here.

08:06.954 --> 08:11.223
Java, your paws are cold, huh?
She keeps lifting her paws up.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.025
We'll get you
inside soon, huh?

08:15.028 --> 08:17.562
You know, the end result of
this is gonna help Java

08:17.598 --> 08:19.498
bear this cold weather.

08:19.533 --> 08:23.435
And ultimately, her being
able to handle the weather
is gonna help me.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.704
And hopefully by tomorrow this
will be nice and cooled down,

08:25.739 --> 08:27.706
and I'll be able to
apply it to the hide.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.809
So, we'll see how
this process works.

08:35.249 --> 08:37.716
BRITTANY: To raise a family
out here in rural Alaska,

08:37.751 --> 08:43.021
it takes a lot of planning,
or you end up having
issues later on.

08:51.031 --> 08:54.966
KALEB: One of these two mounds
is our foundation materials.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.005
(laughing).

09:00.040 --> 09:02.440
Got you, Gilbert.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.644
BRITTANY: So, Gil and Ellie.

09:05.679 --> 09:09.881
What are you most excited
about building a sauna?

09:09.917 --> 09:11.616
GILBERT: I dunno.

09:11.652 --> 09:14.920
BRITTANY: We're gonna build
it where we have a little room

09:14.955 --> 09:18.423
that's a sauna and then a
bigger area that we can hang

09:18.458 --> 09:21.226
out and play games.

09:21.261 --> 09:25.297
Kaleb and I are going to
start our sauna build.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.098
I am so excited about this.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.034
I've been wanting
one for quite a while.

09:29.069 --> 09:32.370
KALEB: Um, I'll roll a couple of
these short ones out of the way,

09:32.406 --> 09:34.639
and we'll yard
these out of here.

09:35.609 --> 09:38.476
BRITTANY: A lot of our
life here is winter.

09:38.512 --> 09:39.744
It's dark.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.213
At least seven months we
have cold temperatures,

09:42.249 --> 09:44.282
if not also snow.

09:44.318 --> 09:49.554
So, I thought having a way
to heat us up more would
be a really great idea.

09:49.590 --> 09:53.558
And I'm excited to
have this sauna here.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.627
KALEB: That was heavy.

09:55.662 --> 09:57.262
BRITTANY: Yeah.
KALEB: All right.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.097
I think we've got
what we need for a bit.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.665
BRITTANY: Okay.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.535
KALEB: Let's go get started
and not get too overwhelmed

10:03.570 --> 10:06.171
with materials here.

10:06.239 --> 10:08.974
Brittany has long pestered
me about having a sauna,

10:09.009 --> 10:12.010
and I finally got to thinking,
I am a professional builder

10:12.045 --> 10:15.080
and I end up with a lot of
varied building materials

10:15.115 --> 10:16.681
leftover from jobs.

10:16.717 --> 10:19.718
I'm gonna pull every single
trick out of my bag of tricks

10:19.753 --> 10:23.388
to make this the sweetest
sauna in the entire valley here.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.759
BRITTANY: So, what all are
we going to get done today?

10:27.794 --> 10:29.427
KALEB: I'm hoping to
get the floor done.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.895
BRITTANY: Okay.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.832
KALEB: Our skids, floor
joists, and we've gotta
plywood the whole thing.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.200
BRITTANY: Okay.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.974
KALEB: Thank you.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.543
BRITTANY: One thing that I'm
really excited about when it

10:45.579 --> 10:49.014
comes to this sauna is
the family time we'll have,

10:49.049 --> 10:53.718
where we get to go slower,
just share memories,
share stories.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.655
I'm super excited.

10:59.259 --> 11:02.394
Well, I'm pretty impressed
with how much we got done today.

11:02.429 --> 11:06.564
KALEB: It's quite an effort
for two people and kids
quote-unquote "helping".

11:07.034 --> 11:08.800
BRITTANY: Very true.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.636
KALEB: Now, I just gotta
turn it into a building.

11:14.975 --> 11:18.910
MICHAEL: You can talk about
survival theory all you want.

11:18.945 --> 11:23.281
You can make videos about all
your elaborate survival gear,

11:23.316 --> 11:26.985
but you've gotta get out
here in the below-zero
temps and test them.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.522
Because now, that
could mean your life.

11:36.963 --> 11:40.665
This survival
training, stranded.

11:40.701 --> 11:41.866
No food.

11:41.902 --> 11:45.637
This is the worst
of it right here.

11:45.672 --> 11:49.207
But this is something
I've been trained to do.

11:49.876 --> 11:53.912
Sun's going down mighty quick.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.514
Son of a bitch.

11:56.550 --> 11:59.084
And so, I'm gonna build a
basic shelter that's just big

11:59.119 --> 12:02.353
enough for me to crawl into.

12:04.458 --> 12:06.291
Already.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.861
The blade snapped
like a toothpick.

12:09.896 --> 12:13.264
Now all I have is like
two, three inches of blade.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.735
This is not some
sort of a fun game.

12:16.770 --> 12:20.004
I have to know what
works and what doesn't.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.607
When I did my cold
weather survival training,

12:22.642 --> 12:25.210
I was taught to
build a snow cave.

12:25.245 --> 12:30.882
But we had sleeping bags,
and so this is the true test.

12:32.753 --> 12:35.720
All the branches piled
up into a little tunnel,

12:35.756 --> 12:38.289
that's gonna be like rebar.

12:38.325 --> 12:41.226
Because this is all gonna
get filled in with snow.

12:42.028 --> 12:45.230
Fill in any tiny little hole.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.366
And when this sets up,
it'll turn to concrete and

12:48.401 --> 12:51.136
make it an insulated shelter.

12:51.872 --> 12:55.273
A little pocket of warmth.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.478
Number one priority is gotta
get through this first night

13:00.514 --> 13:03.348
without freezing.

13:03.383 --> 13:07.252
And so, once I seal this off,
I ain't breaking the seal,

13:07.287 --> 13:11.422
because at night, it gets
doubly cold down here

13:11.458 --> 13:14.125
near the river valley.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.095
You're not gonna get no
eight hours of rest out here.

13:17.130 --> 13:21.299
Maybe, at most, two hours
between some shivering.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.405
It's a humbling thing.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.507
But I'm gonna try.

13:29.543 --> 13:34.646
But this snow cave,
this is providing nothing.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.850
There's a storm coming.

13:38.885 --> 13:41.986
I'm facing frostbite
or even death.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.134
Hunker down, survive.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.638
Finally, I just bounced
out of there about 5:00 AM.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.676
My feet were cold,
my hands were cold.

14:04.711 --> 14:08.446
I had excruciating pain,
then I had numbness.

14:08.481 --> 14:11.216
I started a fire and
I roasted my hands,

14:11.251 --> 14:13.618
got 'em warm again.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.789
So that snow shelter, it's
really not working properly,

14:17.824 --> 14:20.391
'cause there's not a good
enough blanket of insulation

14:20.427 --> 14:23.061
on the ground,
which is the snow.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.663
And so, really, what I was
doing was I was sitting in a

14:25.699 --> 14:29.133
little ice box
that was freezing.

14:30.804 --> 14:34.172
That's why I'm out here, to
realize that how I was trained

14:34.207 --> 14:38.710
to survive is only going to
work in certain conditions.

14:40.180 --> 14:44.515
In the long run, I feel
prepared to continue on this

14:44.551 --> 14:50.421
survival simulation,
but it's not going as
easy as I wanted it to.

14:50.857 --> 14:53.892
And that is an eye-opener.

14:58.331 --> 15:02.000
BRITTANY: There's a
lot of unrest going on
in the world right now.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.269
Any time that a
family can come together,

15:04.304 --> 15:08.373
that's a really wonderful
way to create harmony.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.380
KALEB: Okay, we can
start pulling layout.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.214
BRITTANY: Okay.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.082
So when we're
done cutting these.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.018
We're going to
get them up there?

15:20.053 --> 15:22.387
KALEB: We're gonna start,
finish framing out the roof.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.621
BRITTANY: Okay.

15:23.657 --> 15:25.723
KALEB: Then we'll
get some sheeting on.

15:25.759 --> 15:29.360
So, my hope is that this sauna
goes off super smoothly and we

15:29.396 --> 15:31.796
have a nice, square building.

15:31.831 --> 15:34.933
But you never know.
It's Alaska.

15:34.968 --> 15:37.602
All right, rafter.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.737
BRITTANY: I thought you
weren't supposed to
stand on the blue part?

15:39.773 --> 15:42.307
KALEB: Oh, it's
merely a suggestion.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.076
BRITTANY: I would assume that
it's too high but I guess not.

15:45.111 --> 15:49.047
KALEB: Come help hold it.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.684
Look at that!

15:52.719 --> 15:54.852
BRITTANY: Yeah.
KALEB: Nice, proud roof.

15:54.888 --> 15:56.521
BRITTANY: So,
what's after this step?

15:56.556 --> 15:59.324
KALEB: Sheeting.
BRITTANY: Woo-hoo!

16:04.731 --> 16:07.265
ELOVIE: Mom!
BRITTANY: What?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.634
ELOVIE: What were you doing?

16:09.669 --> 16:12.337
BRITTANY: We're gonna put
these pieces of boards
up onto the building.

16:12.372 --> 16:13.905
ELOVIE: Why?

16:13.940 --> 16:16.474
BRITTANY: Well, 'cause this
is supposed to be a sauna.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.443
And if we were to put
heat in it right now,

16:18.478 --> 16:22.747
all the heat would go
out to the outdoors, right?

16:24.851 --> 16:28.152
KALEB: There's a lot
involved in building a
small building like this.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.755
It's critical to get
it energy-efficient,

16:30.790 --> 16:32.890
so that it will heat.

16:32.926 --> 16:35.426
After the sheeting is on,
we put vapor barrier in,

16:35.462 --> 16:37.929
that stops air from
moving through the walls.

16:37.964 --> 16:41.065
And then we can heat it.

16:41.101 --> 16:44.702
Get a wood stove
in there, doors, windows.

16:44.738 --> 16:47.405
All that stuff goes in.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.641
And now, all of the sudden,
I've got a building that
I can heat.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.645
BRITTANY: Yeah!
Look at that.

16:54.681 --> 16:58.950
KALEB: Yeah!
BRITTANY: Whoa! Perfection.

16:58.985 --> 17:00.918
KALEB: Good job.

17:00.954 --> 17:02.353
ELOVIE: Mom.
BRITTANY: Uh-hmm.

17:02.389 --> 17:05.289
Here, let's sit and
enjoy the sunset.

17:05.325 --> 17:08.192
KALEB: We're getting
a lot done together.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.895
But there's still
a lot ahead of us.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.202
CHRIS: Out here, everything
is a little different,

17:18.238 --> 17:21.005
and you can't
expect perfection.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.775
Once you realize that your
projects aren't gonna be 100%

17:23.810 --> 17:26.611
perfect, then you
start to get things done.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.181
When you're working
on things out here,

17:30.216 --> 17:32.884
Cosna perfect is all you need.

17:37.991 --> 17:38.990
Ugh.

17:39.025 --> 17:42.593
Everything is
tougher when it's frozen.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.862
There it goes.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.398
Today, I'm gonna
start building this
micro-trapping cabin.

17:47.434 --> 17:50.234
Out here, everything
is based on necessity.

17:50.270 --> 17:54.572
And the need we have
today is getting out to
a better trapping area.

17:57.510 --> 18:00.711
I'm hoping to get like a,
about a one-inch flat surface.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.948
So, when we put the
plastic over the bottom,

18:03.983 --> 18:07.185
got a little bit
of a flat spot.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.153
JESSI: So, with our cabin,
we're gonna start with the

18:09.189 --> 18:13.324
base first, and our skis
are the most important part.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.126
Good enough for
the cabin, yeah?

18:15.161 --> 18:17.295
CHRIS: Yeah.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.496
JESSI: They're gonna
have to be sturdy,

18:18.531 --> 18:20.431
and they're gonna
have to be slick.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.999
CHRIS: Looks pretty good.

18:22.035 --> 18:24.769
JESSI: Cosna good?
CHRIS: Cosna good.

18:25.672 --> 18:28.439
JESSI: Chris and I have
made a sled from wood before,

18:28.475 --> 18:31.509
and it did not work very well.

18:31.544 --> 18:34.612
It kind of got caught up
on tussocks and things.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.181
And, we've learned
from our mistakes.

18:37.217 --> 18:42.286
So last time we were in town,
we got some plastic for it.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.755
And this is gonna
work so much better.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.825
Oh, it looks legit!

18:47.861 --> 18:50.895
CHRIS: I think so, too.

18:56.002 --> 18:57.602
JESSI: This'll be us? Inside?

18:57.637 --> 19:00.738
CHRIS: Yeah. Whoo!
It'll be warm.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.574
JESSI: All right.
So next is the boards, right?

19:03.610 --> 19:05.309
CHRIS: Yeah.

19:05.345 --> 19:08.513
JESSI: All right,
let's get on it.

19:10.483 --> 19:14.118
This is the first
project that I've worked
on anything mobile.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.487
Ready?

19:16.523 --> 19:18.055
Chris and I make a
lot of stuff together,

19:18.091 --> 19:21.425
but I think this is one
of the largest projects
that we've done together.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.760
Okay.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.763
So, I really hope that we can
get it to where it needs to be.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.269
CHRIS: Generator died.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.270
Not sure what to
do about that,

19:32.305 --> 19:34.338
I can go try to
start it again.

19:37.243 --> 19:42.246
Why aren't you running today?

19:42.649 --> 19:44.682
What the (bleep)?

19:56.296 --> 19:59.931
Overload. That sucks.

20:02.135 --> 20:06.537
It's got fuel. Okay.

20:08.274 --> 20:09.907
Guess I'm using a chainsaw.

20:09.943 --> 20:11.309
Damn.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.477
No-go on generator.
It won't run.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.079
JESSI: Okay.

20:15.114 --> 20:17.415
CHRIS: The saw used too
much power for the generator.

20:23.189 --> 20:25.423
I love my chainsaw, I'm
always out here using it.

20:25.458 --> 20:28.993
But it's not a precise tool.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.795
It's hard to get
straight lines.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.698
And it's even harder
to get a sideways line,

20:33.733 --> 20:36.167
so I'm going to build it
almost like a skeleton.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.402
The bare minimum for
now, get this thing built,

20:38.438 --> 20:40.004
see if I can move
it easy enough.

20:40.039 --> 20:42.673
Then I'll go back
through and reinforce
things like the floor.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.509
It is what it is.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.445
JESSI: It is what it is!

20:47.480 --> 20:48.713
All right.

20:48.748 --> 20:52.783
CHRIS: Even with our setbacks,
it's not a bad-looking floor.

20:52.819 --> 20:55.886
We're getting there.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.626
JESSI: With the
posts and the roof,

21:01.661 --> 21:03.861
you can actually start see
what it's going to look like

21:03.896 --> 21:05.062
in the end.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.398
It's starting to resemble a
little house now instead of

21:07.433 --> 21:10.001
just some pieces of wood.

21:10.036 --> 21:14.005
I just really hope
that it goes down the
trail nice and well.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.073
You think you could
move it with me in it?

21:16.109 --> 21:17.808
CHRIS: I'll try!

21:17.844 --> 21:20.845
JESSI: Just give it
a little go-skis.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.016
Oh, jeez! Okay!

21:25.051 --> 21:27.718
Oh, my goodness.

21:27.754 --> 21:30.054
CHRIS: Wow, easier
than anticipated!

21:30.857 --> 21:32.623
But once we put the walls on,
I have a feeling I'm not gonna

21:32.659 --> 21:34.692
be able to move it.

21:39.532 --> 21:42.466
JOHNNY: We all use
resources one way or another.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.535
My resources just
haven't been collected,

21:44.570 --> 21:47.638
assembled, boxed up, and
delivered to my front door.

21:54.614 --> 21:57.515
Just breaking up the fibers a
little bit with a steel brush.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.551
What I'm hoping that will do
is allow the brain matter to

22:00.586 --> 22:03.321
penetrate the hide a
little bit better.

22:04.457 --> 22:07.725
That way I can have a more
malleable hide to work with

22:07.760 --> 22:09.727
when I make booties.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.662
Kind of like a parka for Java.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.130
And I want her to
be out here with me,

22:13.166 --> 22:15.232
I want her to spend
time in the wild with me.

22:15.268 --> 22:16.934
And in order to
do that, you know,

22:17.003 --> 22:21.405
I gotta help her adapt,
'cause she doesn't have
what she needs naturally.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.041
It's just
breaking up the fibers,

22:24.077 --> 22:26.243
and my thinking is that
that's gonna allow that brain,

22:26.279 --> 22:29.213
which is moist, to absorb
through the chalky surface

22:29.248 --> 22:31.982
that I'm creating.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.752
I don't have like an
instruction booklet
on how to do this.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.520
It's all about
trial and error,

22:36.556 --> 22:39.423
that's how I learn best.

22:39.792 --> 22:41.926
It's pretty much
all scratched up.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.661
I think that's about it.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.062
So I'm gonna take this inside
and start massaging the

22:45.098 --> 22:47.765
brain matter into it.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.568
Let's go play
with some brains, huh?

22:54.674 --> 22:56.707
So, this is the brain here.

22:56.743 --> 23:01.145
It's got a nice texture to it,
so I'm gonna start applying it.

23:03.182 --> 23:04.615
Just gotta find
that, that balance,

23:04.650 --> 23:07.818
making sure I'm not using
too much or too little because

23:07.854 --> 23:11.021
this, this amount has to
spread over this entire surface.

23:12.358 --> 23:14.358
This isn't gross to me, this
is probably disgusting to

23:14.394 --> 23:15.993
a lot of people.

23:16.028 --> 23:17.361
There's brain
all over my hands,

23:17.397 --> 23:19.330
there's brain all
over this hide.

23:19.365 --> 23:21.265
This hide came
from a dead animal.

23:21.300 --> 23:25.302
But I don't view it that way.
This is just a resource to me.

23:25.338 --> 23:29.206
It matches my environment.
It matches the land.

23:29.242 --> 23:32.009
This is what it's
all about out here.

23:32.044 --> 23:35.246
That's pretty much
the end of it there.

23:36.449 --> 23:40.151
So before it dries,
I'm gonna shut this to
keep this from drying.

23:40.186 --> 23:44.155
And I gotta fold
this in on itself.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.923
So that's rolled
up real tight.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.325
It looks really good.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.898
That should be good there.

23:53.933 --> 23:57.501
What do you think, Java? Huh?
You wanna clean the bowl?

23:58.104 --> 24:01.372
Come on.
This is all you, girl.

24:02.508 --> 24:04.875
That's tasty,
greasy brains, huh?

24:04.911 --> 24:07.411
Hope you don't end
up eating the parka.

24:07.847 --> 24:10.147
I only have so
much brain matter.

24:10.183 --> 24:11.649
You're such a goof.

24:11.684 --> 24:15.019
So, if I was to learn
that I needed more because
it didn't penetrate,

24:15.054 --> 24:18.155
I would be in trouble.
I don't have another brain.

24:22.128 --> 24:25.229
MICHAEL: Facing nature every
day with your wits and living

24:25.264 --> 24:28.933
through some of the
coldest, harshest weather,

24:30.269 --> 24:32.870
that's the only
way I like to roll.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.314
That first night
was so (bleep) rough.

24:43.349 --> 24:45.916
That is just an eye-opener.

24:46.419 --> 24:49.920
I maybe dozed off a couple
times for a few minutes.

24:49.956 --> 24:53.224
But I certainly didn't
get no good night's rest.

24:56.429 --> 24:59.663
This is day two
with a hole in my gut.

25:01.234 --> 25:03.234
I can feel the
fatigue setting in,

25:03.269 --> 25:06.237
not having a real
meal for two days now.

25:07.840 --> 25:11.308
So today, I need fuel.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.544
And in order to
find that fuel,

25:13.579 --> 25:17.414
I gotta get to hunting.

25:19.151 --> 25:21.952
But out here,
there's really nothing.

25:21.988 --> 25:24.755
I have seen no grouse tracks.

25:24.790 --> 25:28.192
There's no snowshoe
hare density here.

25:28.995 --> 25:33.230
Low snow and below zero
actually kills off animals.

25:34.500 --> 25:37.334
The ones that stay
all winter long,

25:37.370 --> 25:40.170
they have a hard
life out here.

25:45.711 --> 25:48.712
I hear a squirrel right here.

25:48.748 --> 25:51.982
I see where he'd been
eating spruce cones.

25:52.885 --> 25:57.121
Squirrel isn't even
something that would
normally be on my menu.

25:57.857 --> 26:00.424
It's on the menu now.

26:05.831 --> 26:10.134
It's crazy how fuzzy your mind
can go when you're hungry.

26:11.537 --> 26:13.771
There it is.

26:14.206 --> 26:15.940
Dinner bell.

26:15.975 --> 26:18.509
How numb...

26:18.544 --> 26:20.811
(gunshot).

26:22.915 --> 26:25.649
The entire chemistry
of your body changes when

26:25.685 --> 26:29.219
you haven't really
eaten enough nutrients.

26:30.957 --> 26:33.958
I know now what it's
like when you're starving.

26:33.993 --> 26:35.826
(gunshot).

26:35.861 --> 26:39.797
(bleep), man.
I desperately need fuel.

26:45.471 --> 26:46.470
(gunshot).

26:58.985 --> 27:00.951
MICHAEL: All right.

27:02.188 --> 27:07.391
That right there, in
the scheme of survival,
is a lifesaver.

27:08.628 --> 27:12.529
That's about the equivalent
of four chicken nuggies.

27:14.166 --> 27:17.101
But I'm a 220-pound man.

27:17.136 --> 27:21.372
I ain't gonna sustain myself
off a four-piece chicken nuggie.

27:21.407 --> 27:24.341
I need a
eight-piece chicken nuggie.

27:27.546 --> 27:29.880
It's right there.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.416
(gunshot).

27:35.221 --> 27:37.821
There it is.
Eight-piece chicken nuggie.

27:39.625 --> 27:43.460
It's not near enough for a
day's worth of food but,

27:43.496 --> 27:46.196
I'm not gonna
ration that out.

27:46.232 --> 27:49.400
It's meat.

27:50.903 --> 27:52.903
Sun's going down.

27:52.938 --> 27:56.373
I need to go back into
energy conservation mode.

27:59.045 --> 28:02.012
Well, that don't
look half bad.

28:03.149 --> 28:06.050
Starving and eating squirrel.

28:06.085 --> 28:08.519
Ain't no joke.

28:08.554 --> 28:12.222
Wow! Tastes just like
the spruce they eat.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.626
It'll have to do.

28:15.661 --> 28:19.630
To just go from no energy to
something going in the gut,

28:19.665 --> 28:22.866
I just lost all my drowsiness.

28:22.902 --> 28:25.936
Must have some sustenance.

28:26.706 --> 28:28.972
That's a good little nibble.

28:29.008 --> 28:31.208
Ah, I got some juice in there.

28:32.344 --> 28:35.079
KALEB: Everything is just
so rugged and magnificent.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.580
I get to experience it.

28:36.615 --> 28:38.415
My kids get to experience it.

28:38.451 --> 28:42.886
Feel so blessed to be able
to just walk out my door
and adventure awaits.

28:51.097 --> 28:52.296
Hey, buddy!

28:52.331 --> 28:53.664
GILBERT: Hi.
KALEB: Just in time.

28:53.699 --> 28:55.265
The stove's nice and warm.

28:55.301 --> 28:57.868
If we sit right here, we
can sweat in the sauna.

28:57.903 --> 29:01.271
We just kinda hug the stove.
Ah, so warm in here.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.741
(laughing).

29:03.776 --> 29:06.643
All right, Gilbert,
let's start installing.

29:08.614 --> 29:11.148
All right, can you push
up here on the door as
high as you can reach?

29:19.592 --> 29:21.558
Okay, we can put
some shims in there.

29:24.530 --> 29:25.929
KALEB: Yeah, the
shims stay in there.

29:25.965 --> 29:28.465
They're what hold
the door in place.

29:29.034 --> 29:32.336
There's a lot of technological
advances in the world.

29:32.371 --> 29:36.206
There's
electricity, plumbing, heat.

29:36.242 --> 29:40.310
All these creature comforts
that humans have made.

29:40.346 --> 29:43.347
And pull with this sauna,
there's gonna be no TV in

29:43.382 --> 29:46.016
there to distract the kids.

29:46.051 --> 29:49.887
No phone in there to
distract myself or my wife.

29:49.922 --> 29:54.024
And we should be able
to have focused quality
time in this building.

29:54.693 --> 29:58.529
BRITTANY: Hey, we have a door.
Can I see what's going on?

29:58.564 --> 30:00.197
KALEB: Yeah.
It's nice and warm.

30:00.232 --> 30:03.767
BRITTANY: Wow!
This is awesome.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.170
KALEB: I think I'm
ready to go get some cedar.

30:06.205 --> 30:08.605
BRITTANY: Cool.
Let's go do that.

30:08.641 --> 30:12.142
KALEB: And hope it
warms up enough to work.

30:15.414 --> 30:16.880
CHRIS: I'm so far from town.

30:16.916 --> 30:20.517
I can't just run and
get supplies to address
a problem out here.

30:20.553 --> 30:23.253
It pushes you every time
you work on a project.

30:23.289 --> 30:25.022
But there's always
trial and error.

30:25.057 --> 30:27.491
But that's half the fun.

30:35.534 --> 30:37.467
All right.
That does the door.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.903
JESSI: Our door.

30:41.907 --> 30:43.874
CHRIS: All right.
Looks good in here.

30:43.909 --> 30:45.108
JESSI: Ooh, it's short.

30:45.144 --> 30:47.845
CHRIS: I like the door.
Closes nice and tight.

30:47.880 --> 30:52.015
JESSI: Can stand up.
Can stand up.

30:52.051 --> 30:54.852
Got a lot of room.
Have a little bit of room.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.354
Yeah. This is great.

30:57.389 --> 31:00.357
CHRIS: So, I'm feeling like
we're gettin' pretty heavy.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.793
And we might
have to forgo beds.

31:02.828 --> 31:05.562
It's gonna be about as
heavy as one of these walls.

31:05.598 --> 31:07.297
And each time we
put another wall on,

31:07.333 --> 31:09.867
it increasingly
gets much heavier.

31:09.902 --> 31:11.702
So, I'm worried about that.

31:11.737 --> 31:13.904
I'd like to push it right now,
see if I can even move it.

31:13.939 --> 31:16.640
JESSI: Yeah. Okay.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.611
CHRIS: The cabin
is really heavy.

31:20.646 --> 31:22.379
It's built outta all green
wood and it hasn't had a

31:22.414 --> 31:23.981
year to cure yet.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.916
See if I can push this thing.

31:25.951 --> 31:28.252
I'm not even sure how
well it's gonna tow.

31:28.287 --> 31:30.754
JESSI: Are you ready?
CHRIS: Okay.

31:30.789 --> 31:32.923
The whole point of this is
to be able to move it from

31:32.958 --> 31:34.892
trapping area to
trapping area.

31:34.927 --> 31:36.660
(grunting).

31:36.695 --> 31:39.496
Okay. I'm gonna see if
the skis are frozen.

31:39.531 --> 31:40.898
Nope.

31:40.933 --> 31:42.799
We wanna migrate
with the animals.

31:42.835 --> 31:43.967
Oh, man!
She's heavy.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.035
JESSI: Ooh!
CHRIS: Okay.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.437
I'm gonna try to push again.
This is it.

31:47.473 --> 31:50.674
If I can't move it,
then this thing's useless.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.242
All right, here we go.

31:59.785 --> 32:03.020
JESSI: Oh, man.
CHRIS: Ugh!

32:03.055 --> 32:05.055
JESSI: There you go.
CHRIS: Okay.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.957
It still moves.

32:06.992 --> 32:09.459
Well, we still have
another wall to put on.

32:09.495 --> 32:12.462
JESSI: Yeah.

32:15.668 --> 32:18.168
CHRIS: Ugh! It's a pretty
big gap down here,

32:18.203 --> 32:20.203
but I don't know
what else to do.

32:20.239 --> 32:21.538
Should be interesting.

32:21.573 --> 32:25.042
JESSI: This one might be short,
I'm not sure.

32:25.477 --> 32:27.244
CHRIS: I'm excited to
get this cabin towed,

32:27.279 --> 32:29.279
but the anxiety's pouring.

32:29.315 --> 32:31.848
JESSI: There we go.

32:31.884 --> 32:33.183
CHRIS: We spent a
lot of time on this.

32:33.218 --> 32:34.985
Why is it so bad now?

32:35.020 --> 32:37.354
I have this feeling it's
just gonna (bleep) rip apart.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.924
It's the first time I've
ever built anything like this.

32:40.960 --> 32:44.561
But if we can actually
tow it down the trail,

32:44.596 --> 32:46.964
and I can actually get it out
to the family trapping area

32:46.999 --> 32:49.833
and we can't start trapping,
it's worth the risk.

32:50.970 --> 32:52.936
Some of these things
do not wanna stay.

32:52.972 --> 32:54.538
It's Cosna perfect.

32:54.573 --> 32:57.207
It doesn't have to be 100%,
as long as we're aiming in
the right direction.

32:57.242 --> 33:00.510
A few more screws
to tighten it up.

33:02.381 --> 33:03.547
JESSI: Push this that way.

33:03.582 --> 33:09.019
CHRIS: Yeah. Okay.
JESSI: Okay.

33:12.224 --> 33:14.358
CHRIS: Good. That's it.
Outta battery.

33:14.393 --> 33:19.196
Last screw. All right.
Let's check it out inside.

33:24.136 --> 33:25.736
JOHNNY: I don't have
utilities out here.

33:25.771 --> 33:28.005
I don't have any
modern conveniences.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.606
And that's what I
love about out here.

33:29.641 --> 33:31.074
No bills are on my mind.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.476
No parking tickets.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.445
No fears of any,
anything like that.

33:35.481 --> 33:39.149
It's just peace, it's
quiet, and there's no
place I'd rather be.

33:42.988 --> 33:45.522
Alright, now let's see.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.194
Nice and
waterproof for you.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.063
So, the brain's
soaked into this hide.

33:53.098 --> 33:54.931
I've had it sitting
for two, three days.

33:54.967 --> 33:56.900
And I've already
noticed quite a difference.

33:56.935 --> 33:58.835
I mean, this thing is soft.

33:58.871 --> 34:01.171
It's nice and flexible.

34:01.206 --> 34:02.539
I'm gonna take it one step
further and I'm gonna start

34:02.574 --> 34:05.809
sewin' up a, a parka for Java.

34:06.245 --> 34:08.945
Let me see that big old paw.

34:08.981 --> 34:12.182
When you cut hide, you have to
cut so you don't cut the hair.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.051
You kinda want that,
the seams to go together,

34:14.086 --> 34:16.887
and the hair kind
of hides the seam.

34:16.922 --> 34:18.922
It'll keep any wind out too.

34:18.957 --> 34:22.526
And I gotta make it
so her front arms,

34:22.561 --> 34:24.961
her front shoulders can move.

34:24.997 --> 34:27.898
So, I'll have something that
comes underneath and it wraps

34:27.933 --> 34:31.334
across her belly but
still has movement,

34:31.370 --> 34:34.671
total movement with her,
with her shoulders.

34:34.706 --> 34:37.441
We don't want you
hindered, do we?

34:39.645 --> 34:41.344
So this hind part's sewed on.

34:41.380 --> 34:45.215
I got it all stitched up.
The seam looks pretty good.

34:45.250 --> 34:49.886
Wanna give it a go, Java?
Try on this parka.

34:49.922 --> 34:52.389
What do you think? Warm?

34:54.059 --> 34:58.161
Yeah. Look at that.
Looks nice.

34:58.197 --> 35:00.097
It covers up your
neck real good.

35:00.132 --> 35:01.498
The next part, I think I'm
just gonna make a simple

35:01.533 --> 35:04.367
little strip to go over her
ears because her ears are the

35:04.403 --> 35:07.904
most prone to frostbite
of anything on her body.

35:08.540 --> 35:13.143
Make some little mukluks
to keep your feet nice
and dry and warm.

35:13.879 --> 35:17.047
I think she'll be
good to go with those.

35:17.816 --> 35:19.716
Having Java out
here is the best.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.952
It's nice to have a, a
friend, a companion.

35:21.987 --> 35:23.854
It's a, it's a huge
morale boost for me.

35:23.889 --> 35:26.022
You know, it'd be harder to
be out here without Java.

35:26.058 --> 35:29.459
She makes it possible to
spend long times in the dark,

35:29.495 --> 35:31.194
long times in the cold.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.363
It's a team effort out here.

35:33.398 --> 35:35.632
So if you got your paw out
like you're ready to throw

35:35.667 --> 35:37.200
this thing on.

35:37.236 --> 35:39.636
You wanna give it a try?

35:39.671 --> 35:41.238
As soon as you step
outside, hopefully,

35:41.273 --> 35:42.839
you'll feel a difference.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.943
MICHAEL: It's a
universal thing.

35:46.979 --> 35:49.813
Stay home when it's
really brutally cold.

35:50.616 --> 35:53.150
Don't try to
fight the weather.

35:53.185 --> 35:55.452
But there comes a time when
you actually have to work out

35:55.487 --> 35:59.256
in this 20, 30, 40,
50-below weather.

35:59.291 --> 36:02.526
That's just the
nature of life here.

36:10.235 --> 36:13.003
There's another squirrel.

36:13.038 --> 36:15.539
Glad I don't have to
eat another one of those.

36:15.574 --> 36:18.408
But they weren't all that bad.

36:21.113 --> 36:24.181
One of the most sobering things
I've ever read on survival

36:24.216 --> 36:28.785
was Jack London wrote
a short story called
"To Make a Fire".

36:31.323 --> 36:32.522
I believe that's what it was.

36:32.558 --> 36:35.325
I read it when I was in Iraq.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.895
And then I read it again
in a winter ecology course.

36:38.931 --> 36:44.601
Thinking of survival, especially
with below-zero temps,

36:44.636 --> 36:48.405
it's a good thing coming
out here and actually
experiencing it.

36:50.876 --> 36:54.578
The final chore of my
simulation is I need to create

36:54.613 --> 36:57.781
a signal, a smudge fire.

36:59.351 --> 37:02.152
My campsite's
tucked in the woods.

37:02.187 --> 37:04.521
I wanna be out in the open.

37:09.528 --> 37:11.061
If authorities are
looking for you,

37:11.096 --> 37:14.698
what you may end up with is a
plane circling around above,

37:14.733 --> 37:17.033
assisting a ground party.

37:20.138 --> 37:24.107
And so, I might be smart
to combine a smudge
fire with some noise.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.310
I don't want no blunders.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.879
I want this smudge
fire to go up fast.

37:30.549 --> 37:34.684
Time to get this signal going
because a plane is traveling

37:34.720 --> 37:39.189
90 somethin' miles an hour,
if not faster,

37:39.224 --> 37:42.158
and I don't want
them to miss me.

37:42.194 --> 37:45.428
(blowing whistle).

37:45.464 --> 37:49.466
All right, chances are I would
not be in a standing position

37:49.501 --> 37:50.867
at the ready.

37:50.902 --> 37:55.038
I would be
hunkered down like this.

37:56.308 --> 37:59.843
And so the time starts now,
from the resting position.

38:00.445 --> 38:05.015
I hear a plane, the faintest
sound of the ground crew.

38:05.050 --> 38:07.751
And I gotta rush out there.

38:09.154 --> 38:11.087
Plane! Plane!

38:20.132 --> 38:22.565
Plane!

38:24.503 --> 38:26.002
Plane!

38:26.038 --> 38:29.072
(blowing whistle).

38:30.642 --> 38:32.809
(blowing whistle).

38:36.448 --> 38:40.383
(blowing whistle).

38:40.419 --> 38:42.252
If authorities are
out looking for you,

38:42.287 --> 38:44.721
and they have a ground party
and a plane up in the sky,

38:44.790 --> 38:46.723
that's an immense resource.

38:46.758 --> 38:48.358
(blowing whistle).

38:48.393 --> 38:51.895
That's a lot of money
being spent to find you.

38:51.930 --> 38:55.365
Authorities are
heroes up here every year.

38:56.068 --> 38:59.135
Out of appreciation,
I owe it to them...

38:59.171 --> 39:00.837
(blowing whistle).

39:00.872 --> 39:03.907
to be as
prepared as best as I can.

39:05.110 --> 39:07.177
Nice.

39:07.212 --> 39:10.313
Look at how that
smoke is billowing.

39:10.349 --> 39:15.218
That could be seen
from miles away.

39:16.321 --> 39:18.021
(blowing whistle).

39:19.024 --> 39:23.093
JOHNNY: Sometimes I wonder
who likes it out here more,

39:23.128 --> 39:25.729
Java or myself.

39:27.265 --> 39:29.399
But as it gets colder I worry.

39:29.434 --> 39:31.301
After seeing her running
around with the gear on,

39:31.336 --> 39:35.372
it definitely proves
that she loves it
out here just as much.

39:35.407 --> 39:36.940
And the more she
loves it out here,

39:36.975 --> 39:38.274
the more I do.

39:38.310 --> 39:42.445
Seeing her enjoyment
out here, it fulfills me.

39:42.481 --> 39:46.516
It makes me enjoy being
out here that much more.

39:46.585 --> 39:49.085
Good girl, Java.
Come on.

39:49.721 --> 39:53.323
Come on.
Good girl.

39:53.358 --> 39:54.958
Come here. Drop.

39:54.993 --> 39:56.259
What do you think, huh?

39:56.294 --> 39:58.695
Do you like it?
Do you like it?

39:59.564 --> 40:02.432
They're all staying on
your feet real nice.

40:02.467 --> 40:04.901
It really makes me feel
complete on this land,

40:04.936 --> 40:07.570
to utilize all these
parts of this caribou.

40:07.606 --> 40:10.206
And I think a lot of people
would view this process as

40:10.242 --> 40:12.776
moving backwards in time.

40:12.811 --> 40:14.844
But I view it as
moving forward.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.547
Because without having
warm clothing out here,

40:17.582 --> 40:19.916
you're just not gonna make it.

40:19.951 --> 40:21.851
Picking up this
skill, you know,

40:21.887 --> 40:24.087
I got many more to learn.

40:24.122 --> 40:26.222
Good girl, Java.
Come on.

40:26.258 --> 40:28.591
But, I definitely feel that
I've taken one step closer to

40:28.627 --> 40:31.428
being completely self-reliant.

40:32.764 --> 40:35.064
BRITTANY: Who's ready
for the first sauna?

40:35.100 --> 40:36.199
KALEB: I am.

40:36.234 --> 40:37.534
BRITTANY: All right,
this one's my stool.

40:37.569 --> 40:38.802
GILBERT: No!
BRITTANY: Watch out.

40:38.837 --> 40:41.037
GILBERT: This one mine.
ELOVIE: And this one mine.

40:41.072 --> 40:42.172
KALEB: Hey, that's my spot.

40:42.207 --> 40:44.841
All right. Stove
is all stoked up.

40:44.876 --> 40:47.844
BRITTANY: It's gonna
get steamy up in here.

40:47.879 --> 40:50.413
One reason that I really
wanted to build this sauna was

40:50.449 --> 40:53.716
I thought it would be fun to
have a weekly time together,

40:53.752 --> 40:56.853
where we all come and hang out
in here and just have a really

40:56.888 --> 40:59.322
fun family time.

40:59.357 --> 41:02.058
KALEB: You get out what you
put into something and we put

41:02.093 --> 41:05.061
a lot into this, so we
should get a lot out of it.

41:05.096 --> 41:07.230
BRITTANY: I think so, too.

41:07.265 --> 41:10.300
KALEB: It's great sitting in
here stroking the black death

41:10.335 --> 41:14.671
out of my hair that got in
there from building this place.

41:14.706 --> 41:16.806
Oh, that feels good.

41:16.842 --> 41:21.444
BRITTANY: Oh, no more.
No more.

41:22.581 --> 41:23.980
Okay, I'm good. I'm good.

41:24.015 --> 41:25.381
Gilbert. Gilbert.

41:25.417 --> 41:26.950
KALEB: Gilbert, you
need to settle down.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.918
BRITTANY: I said no more.
GILBERT: Okay.

41:31.790 --> 41:34.991
CHRIS: See if we
can get it to go.

41:37.095 --> 41:39.229
Holy cow. Okay.

41:39.264 --> 41:42.465
JESSI: Just easy goes.

41:42.501 --> 41:45.034
I've been stoked about
this cabin for days.

41:45.070 --> 41:47.570
Things that I'm
gonna, you know,

41:47.606 --> 41:50.840
do with the cabin, I mean, I'm
really excited about moving

41:50.876 --> 41:53.276
this to a better
place to trap.

41:53.311 --> 41:56.679
Hopefully to the spot
that I have imagined.

41:57.182 --> 41:58.815
Stop! Chris!

41:58.850 --> 42:00.950
CHRIS: Bit of a tree, huh?

42:00.986 --> 42:03.753
The name of the game here is
to transport this little cabin

42:03.788 --> 42:05.388
and not break it.

42:05.423 --> 42:07.357
Jess and I are gonna take this
out to the family trapping

42:07.392 --> 42:10.760
area and then hopefully
leave it for the winter.

42:13.164 --> 42:15.899
I think this is gonna be a
really good area for trapping.

42:15.934 --> 42:18.401
Nobody's trapped
it since, maybe, 1980?

42:18.436 --> 42:21.771
So, it's had a long time
to, to get ready for us.

42:21.806 --> 42:24.140
Oh!

42:24.175 --> 42:25.441
JESSI: What's going on?

42:25.477 --> 42:27.477
CHRIS: There it goes!

42:27.512 --> 42:31.681
JESSI: Oh, wow! Okay.

42:31.716 --> 42:33.750
CHRIS: Whoo! Whoo!
JESSI: Okay.

42:33.785 --> 42:37.520
CHRIS: We've had a lot
of trouble out here.

42:37.956 --> 42:41.925
It just means so much
to me that we came
together as a family.

42:41.960 --> 42:45.762
I love overcoming obstacles
and not relying on anybody else.

42:47.699 --> 42:50.900
We did it!

42:50.936 --> 42:53.202
JESSI: Yeah.
We did it!

42:53.238 --> 42:55.405
CHRIS: Awesome!
JESSI: Oh, my goodness!

42:55.440 --> 42:56.806
CHRIS: I can't believe we
made it all the way here.

42:56.841 --> 42:59.208
JESSI: Holy smokes!

43:06.484 --> 43:09.319
MICHAEL: You know, when
I was five years old,

43:09.354 --> 43:14.791
my aunt and her boyfriend,
his name was Cecil Gallagher,

43:14.826 --> 43:19.162
took me to a, a
fairly deep pond.

43:20.131 --> 43:23.132
I lost my footing and
I started drifting out.

43:23.168 --> 43:27.003
I didn't know how to
swim, choking on water.

43:27.839 --> 43:30.773
Tried to keep my head
afloat and I couldn't.

43:30.809 --> 43:34.177
The summer sunlight was
beginning to dissipate.

43:34.212 --> 43:37.180
I felt the
pressure against my ears.

43:37.215 --> 43:40.583
I said, "Well, this is
what it's like to die."

43:41.720 --> 43:44.554
And Cecil Gallagher,
this sturdy, pale,

43:44.589 --> 43:46.823
little blue-eyed Irish man,

43:46.858 --> 43:50.760
grabbed me out of
the dark depths,

43:50.795 --> 43:52.495
and I started
breathing air again,

43:52.530 --> 43:54.497
and I came to.

43:54.532 --> 43:56.666
I remember what that's like.

43:56.701 --> 43:59.769
And I'm sure other victims
who've been revived can

43:59.804 --> 44:03.139
recall that it's pretty
frantic stuff.

44:03.174 --> 44:07.944
And maybe that's why I have a
little bit more interest than

44:07.979 --> 44:11.514
most folks would
about survival,

44:12.951 --> 44:15.551
because sometimes I'm
not gonna have that

44:15.587 --> 44:19.355
Cecil Gallagher there to give
me a new chance in life.
