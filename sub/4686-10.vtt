WEBVTT

00:00.227 --> 00:01.814
<i>So here's what</i>
<i>you missed on</i> Glee:

00:01.830 --> 00:03.160
<i>Rachel and Santana</i>
<i>are on the outs</i>

00:03.183 --> 00:05.052
<i>because Santana</i>
<i>landed a job in</i> Funny Girl

00:05.091 --> 00:07.250
<i>as Rachel's understudy,</i>
<i>even though Santana's Latin</i>

00:07.289 --> 00:08.478
<i>and Fanny Brice</i>
<i>is clearly Jewish.</i>

00:08.501 --> 00:09.866
You and I have
never been friends.

00:09.900 --> 00:11.501
Never have and never will be.

00:11.540 --> 00:14.149
<i>Nationals is fast approaching</i>
<i>and graduation's in two weeks.</i>

00:14.168 --> 00:16.551
- My fellow graduates.
- God, this can't be happening.

00:16.583 --> 00:17.058
<i>But not everyone knows what</i>

00:17.083 --> 00:18.478
<i>they're going to do</i>
<i>once they graduate,</i>

00:18.503 --> 00:20.249
<i>because New Directions!</i>
<i>Seem to plan their lives</i>

00:20.280 --> 00:21.208
<i>like they plan</i>
<i>their set lists...</i>

00:21.242 --> 00:22.566
<i>they pretty much figure it out</i>
<i>the night before.</i>

00:22.591 --> 00:23.736
I'm not ready to make
a decision yet.

00:23.773 --> 00:24.462
Okay.

00:24.480 --> 00:26.157
<i>And that's what</i>
<i>you missed on</i> Glee.

00:28.433 --> 00:31.568
They were encouraged to take the
shortcut by Lanford Hastings,

00:31.603 --> 00:33.170
who had never
taken the journey with wagons.

00:33.204 --> 00:34.872
This required them to traverse

00:34.906 --> 00:36.974
through Utah's
Wasatch Mountains...

00:37.008 --> 00:39.076
Will, it's time.
We have to do it right now.

00:39.110 --> 00:41.011
Winter came and the Donner Party
got trapped in the mountains

00:41.046 --> 00:42.880
and they ate each other...
everybody discuss.

00:45.984 --> 00:47.952
What's up, buddy? How you doing?
All right, cool.

00:51.756 --> 00:53.724
Oh, my goodness.

00:53.758 --> 00:55.726
Yes. This is happening.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.194
Oh, Will.

00:57.228 --> 00:58.963
Ooh.

00:58.997 --> 01:00.531
What's going on in there?

01:00.565 --> 01:02.199
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

01:02.233 --> 01:04.968
Oh, ooh.

01:06.438 --> 01:09.473
I am disturbed on every level.

01:10.675 --> 01:12.242
And Becky has been
scarred for life.

01:13.845 --> 01:15.479
Sue, I'm mortified.

01:15.513 --> 01:17.815
We are so, so...

01:17.849 --> 01:21.685
I am aware that the pheromones
emitted from the orifices

01:21.720 --> 01:23.554
of your porous, bird-lady pelvis

01:23.588 --> 01:25.422
can cause an overwhelming urge

01:25.457 --> 01:28.792
to copulate in some emotionally
stunted man-children,

01:28.827 --> 01:32.396
with butt-chins, who befriend
teenagers and can't rap.

01:32.430 --> 01:36.066
But why could you not wait
to copulate until you returned

01:36.101 --> 01:39.670
to the sickly-sweet stench
of your own conjugal bed?

01:39.704 --> 01:42.506
I'm... well, Sue, uh...

01:42.540 --> 01:44.575
Will and I are trying
to conceive a child...

01:44.609 --> 01:46.643
Oh, God, why?

01:46.678 --> 01:49.046
And-and there are
certain windows of time

01:49.080 --> 01:51.448
where fertilization
is most likely.

01:51.483 --> 01:52.950
See, we-we finally
feel like we have

01:52.984 --> 01:55.252
some financial security;
I'm 37...

01:55.286 --> 01:58.155
Yes, and I'm-I'm...
I'm of a similar age range,

01:58.189 --> 02:00.758
and after the age of 35,

02:00.792 --> 02:04.528
you know, the chances of birth
defects increase dramatically.

02:04.562 --> 02:05.829
There's, um,
fragile X chromosome,

02:05.864 --> 02:07.965
there's Down syndrome...

02:07.999 --> 02:10.334
- What's wrong with Down syndrome?
- What's wrong with Down syndrome?

02:10.368 --> 02:11.835
- N-No... nothing. There's... That's...
- No. N... No, Sue...

02:11.870 --> 02:12.970
Look, Sue, we are so sorry.

02:13.004 --> 02:14.405
This is not gonna happen
again, I promise.

02:14.439 --> 02:16.240
Well, hopefully it won't have
to, if I hurry up right now

02:16.274 --> 02:19.343
and lie down on the floor in my
office and put my feet up on a chair,

02:19.377 --> 02:22.312
because we were able to achieve
a successful emission.

02:24.616 --> 02:26.016
Okay, get the hell
out of my office.

02:26.051 --> 02:26.984
Please. Thanks.

02:28.319 --> 02:30.287
Oh, didn't need to know that.

02:30.321 --> 02:32.222
Didn't need to know that.
Nope.

You guys, that was
amazing, but, um,

04:32.510 --> 04:34.044
I'm not sure it's
right for Nationals.

04:34.078 --> 04:36.346
Yes, 'cause Unique will not
be standing in the back swaying

04:36.381 --> 04:38.882
while you guys go all
Three-yoncé in the spotlight.

04:38.917 --> 04:41.018
Why does everything you say
have to sound like that?

04:41.052 --> 04:43.120
We know it's not right
for Nationals, we just wanted

04:43.154 --> 04:45.289
to do it for fun. Yeah, we were talking
and we realized that we'd never

04:45.323 --> 04:47.124
actually done a number together.
No, and as seniors we...

04:47.158 --> 04:48.825
realized we were running
out of time and we wanted

04:48.860 --> 04:50.093
to feel the power of a trio.

04:50.128 --> 04:52.896
Which, I learned
in my <i>senior</i> math class,

04:52.931 --> 04:55.165
is about 25% less powerful
than a quartet.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.100
Well, I'm really glad
that you guys did that.

04:57.135 --> 04:58.902
You probably don't realize this,
but these are friendships

04:58.937 --> 05:00.938
that you're gonna cherish
for the rest of your lives.

05:00.972 --> 05:03.740
And you've got to squeeze in
as many experiences as you can

05:03.775 --> 05:05.409
because, for you seniors,

05:05.443 --> 05:07.945
you're all gonna be going
your separate ways very soon.

05:07.979 --> 05:10.180
Oh, no, no, no, no.

05:10.215 --> 05:11.715
No, no, no, no... Tina,
don't, no, no, no.

05:11.749 --> 05:13.650
No, no, no, no. Stop, don't...
you don't have to cry,

05:13.685 --> 05:15.052
No. No!
You don't have to cry.

05:15.086 --> 05:16.853
It's okay. We're here.
We're here for you.

05:16.888 --> 05:18.989
Tina. Guys.

05:19.023 --> 05:20.691
You okay? Huh?

05:20.725 --> 05:22.659
No, you had your turn.

05:24.329 --> 05:25.629
What...?

05:25.663 --> 05:28.465
I'm gonna miss you guys.
That's okay.

05:28.499 --> 05:30.534
Okay. So I want to start
at the overture,

05:30.568 --> 05:32.809
and then I want to do the
entire show from top to bottom.

05:32.837 --> 05:34.137
Maybe two or three times.

05:34.172 --> 05:35.839
Oh, my God, Elliot, hi.
Come on in.

05:35.873 --> 05:37.474
Hey.
Sorry, uh, when you said

05:37.508 --> 05:39.443
you were gonna be
rehearsing on your day off,

05:39.477 --> 05:41.678
I assumed it would just be you,
running scales.

05:41.713 --> 05:43.747
Well, you know.
Since I have Gina Gershon, Jr.

05:43.781 --> 05:46.049
Nipping at my heels here, I had
to have Rupert, my director,

05:46.084 --> 05:47.284
ask Sidney, my producer,

05:47.318 --> 05:48.885
if I could have a
full band on retainer

05:48.920 --> 05:50.787
at all times, so I
could sing full voice,

05:50.822 --> 05:52.383
just to keep my
instrument really sharp.

05:52.390 --> 05:54.658
Wow, you have your own band.
That's impressive.

05:54.692 --> 05:56.193
Oh, yeah, you can borrow
them anytime you want.

05:56.227 --> 05:57.361
Thanks.

05:57.395 --> 05:58.562
Um, in the meanwhile,

05:58.596 --> 06:00.430
I got your rehearsal clothes
dry-cleaned.

06:00.465 --> 06:01.999
Green tea with honey and lemon,

06:02.033 --> 06:04.801
and I got you your
very own key to my apartment.

06:04.836 --> 06:06.870
Elliott!

06:06.904 --> 06:08.071
Seriously, what would
I have done

06:08.106 --> 06:09.539
if you'd have turned
me away at your door?

06:09.574 --> 06:12.209
I was like some heroine from
a lost Tennessee Williams play.

06:14.746 --> 06:17.948
Coming.

06:17.982 --> 06:19.349
They kicked me out.

06:19.384 --> 06:21.685
- Hmm?
- I had nowhere else to go.

06:21.719 --> 06:23.453
Uh... Ooh.

06:23.488 --> 06:25.055
<i>Then it was</i>
<i>so chivalrous of you</i>

06:25.089 --> 06:26.590
<i>when you made up</i>
<i>your couch for me.</i>

06:26.624 --> 06:28.759
<i>But then gave me your bed,</i>
<i>instead, when I explained</i>

06:28.793 --> 06:31.028
<i>that after last week's</i>
<i>traumatic events, the only way</i>

06:31.062 --> 06:32.729
<i>I could recover</i>
<i>is by sleeping in a real bed</i>

06:32.764 --> 06:34.264
<i>and not some lumpy surrogate.</i>

06:37.480 --> 06:40.280
So you're sure you're okay with me
living with you, like, indefinitely?

06:40.305 --> 06:42.606
Yeah, it's cool.
I mean, like I said,

06:42.640 --> 06:43.840
my rent is so high,

06:43.875 --> 06:44.941
and I've been looking
for a roommate,

06:44.976 --> 06:46.743
and...
And now you have one.

06:46.778 --> 06:48.278
And I have a new best gay.

06:48.313 --> 06:49.813
Uh...
Yeah, yeah.

06:49.847 --> 06:52.015
I kind of hate that term.
It makes me feel like a pet.

06:52.050 --> 06:53.250
What do you mean?
It's so funny.

06:53.284 --> 06:55.686
You have done more for me
in the past 24 hours

06:55.720 --> 06:57.754
than that traitor Kurt Hummel
has since graduation.

06:57.789 --> 07:00.724
I was just gonna sing the entire <i>Funny
Girl</i> score. Do you want to watch?

07:00.758 --> 07:02.626
Uh, mm... Oh, please, it'll
be so fun... you can sing

07:02.660 --> 07:04.821
all the chorus parts, if you want.
Tempting.

07:04.829 --> 07:06.296
And I do want to sing with you,

07:06.331 --> 07:08.031
but how about something
a little more rock and roll?

07:08.066 --> 07:10.734
I was gonna suggest this
for Pamela Lansbury,

07:10.768 --> 07:13.270
but maybe you and I
should give it a try.

07:16.541 --> 07:19.910
I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful,

07:19.944 --> 07:20.784

We have to try them on
to see if they fit.

09:33.377 --> 09:35.912
Small, medium, large, it's not that
complicated, okay? I'm sure they all fit.

09:35.947 --> 09:38.715
Well, we should just try them on
to see what they look like.

09:47.258 --> 09:49.893
Holy crap, I can't believe
this is actually happening.

09:49.927 --> 09:51.361
Hey, guys. What's...?

09:53.831 --> 09:55.932
Tina... Oh, no, no, ,no
No, please d...

09:55.967 --> 09:57.100
No, no, Tina, Tina, no, no.

09:57.134 --> 09:58.935
I know this is hard for you,
but come on, please.

09:58.970 --> 10:01.004
No, don't... don't cry.
Try not to cry.

10:01.038 --> 10:03.139
I'm not ready to say
good-bye to you guys yet.

10:03.174 --> 10:04.541
Well, it's not good-bye.

10:04.575 --> 10:06.543
They call graduation
"commencement"

10:06.577 --> 10:08.778
because it's not the end of
something, it's the beginning.

10:08.813 --> 10:10.480
You say that
so we'll go willingly.

10:10.515 --> 10:11.948
Sam, you and Mike
were so close.

10:11.983 --> 10:14.584
Puck, too. When was the last
time you talked to them?

10:14.619 --> 10:15.685
I-I don't know.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.721
I can't remember.

10:17.755 --> 10:20.156
Rachel and I haven't spoken
on the phone in months.

10:20.191 --> 10:21.791
And yes, I know we all
love each other,

10:21.826 --> 10:24.327
but the fact is the glue that
holds high school friendships

10:24.362 --> 10:25.896
together is high school.

10:25.930 --> 10:28.098
Being around each other every day,
seeing each other in the halls.

10:28.132 --> 10:30.166
Whenever something is up,
we don't have to do any work

10:30.201 --> 10:31.768
to talk to our friends about it,
they're right there.

10:31.802 --> 10:34.271
As soon as it takes effort,
we get lazy

10:34.305 --> 10:36.940
and then we forget
and then we just move on.

10:36.974 --> 10:38.775
I don't want to fade away.

10:38.809 --> 10:41.077
But it doesn't have to
go down like that, though.

10:41.112 --> 10:43.079
Like, my dad's best friends are
still his high school buddies.

10:43.114 --> 10:44.915
And they can go, like, a year
without talking to each other

10:44.949 --> 10:46.483
and they get together
and they don't miss a beat.

10:46.517 --> 10:49.085
Yeah, and with Facebook
and e-mail and blogs and stuff

10:49.120 --> 10:50.353
it's much easier
to stay in touch.

10:50.388 --> 10:51.988
Look... here,
I'll make you a deal.

10:52.023 --> 10:54.591
I promise that,
for the rest of our lives,

10:54.625 --> 10:58.261
I will send one Vine of me doing
an impression every week,

10:58.296 --> 11:00.130
Aw.
And then you can send me one

11:00.164 --> 11:01.665
of you soaping up your boobs.

11:01.699 --> 11:02.966
Dude.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.034
Inappropriate.

11:04.068 --> 11:05.368
Three years together,

11:05.403 --> 11:08.638
and he finally notices my boobs?

11:08.673 --> 11:09.673
Victory!

11:10.408 --> 11:11.708
We are all going

11:11.742 --> 11:13.143
to be friends for life.
I promise.

11:13.177 --> 11:15.378
And we still have some
high school left, right?

11:15.413 --> 11:16.534
You know what we need to do?

11:16.547 --> 11:17.514
We need to say
good-bye to this place

11:17.548 --> 11:19.049
with some heroism
and some drama.

11:19.083 --> 11:20.483
We got to do something so epic

11:20.518 --> 11:22.052
that in 30 years time,

11:22.086 --> 11:24.087
we can just call each other up
and reminisce about it.

11:24.121 --> 11:25.822
I know, let's sneak a cow
into school.

11:25.856 --> 11:29.859
I was thinking
more like an overnight lock-in.

11:29.894 --> 11:30.794
I'll talk
to the student council,

11:30.828 --> 11:32.362
and I'll get them to approve it.

11:32.396 --> 11:35.198
- Sounds dangerous. I'm in.
- Yes! Me, too.

11:35.232 --> 11:38.401
- Three-way show circle?
Mm-hmm.

11:38.436 --> 11:40.136
Get in there.

11:40.171 --> 11:41.538
A... mazing!

11:47.947 --> 11:49.815
I just did the pregnancy stick.

11:49.849 --> 11:51.483
Yeah?

11:51.517 --> 11:52.951
It came up negative.

11:54.654 --> 11:55.921
Oh, Em.

11:55.955 --> 11:57.122
Oh.

11:57.156 --> 11:58.257
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:58.291 --> 11:59.372
There's no reason to panic.

11:59.392 --> 12:00.826
I mean, it takes
15-20% of couples

12:00.860 --> 12:02.160
a full year to get pregnant.

12:02.195 --> 12:03.428
I know.

12:03.463 --> 12:06.131
Look, just in case, I went ahead
and made an appointment

12:06.165 --> 12:07.799
at the fertility doctor
on the 15th.

12:07.834 --> 12:09.901
And we'll-we'll go,
we'll take a personal day,

12:09.936 --> 12:11.470
and we'll both go in together.

12:11.504 --> 12:14.273
I promise you,
we'll figure this out.

12:14.307 --> 12:16.108
Uh, I'm-I'm sorry.

12:16.142 --> 12:17.409
Excuse me.

12:20.313 --> 12:23.148
Oh, Will, I'm real sorry.

12:23.182 --> 12:25.584
Oh, I don't mean to intrude,
William, but, uh,

12:25.618 --> 12:27.486
far be it from me to tell you

12:27.520 --> 12:29.154
how to inseminate a
frail, neurotic woman

12:29.188 --> 12:32.291
that I hate, but it occurs
to me, you might want to try

12:32.325 --> 12:34.526
to relax your already
mentally fragile ape-wife

12:34.560 --> 12:36.094
instead of making her cervix

12:36.129 --> 12:37.663
snap shut like a barnacle

12:37.697 --> 12:40.532
by bombarding her with a
barrage of pregnancy statistics.

12:40.566 --> 12:42.167
Sue's got a point there, hon.

12:42.201 --> 12:43.468
Oh, stop agreeing with me.

12:43.503 --> 12:44.670
You don't know what
you're talking about.

12:44.704 --> 12:46.571
The only thing
I can see you giving birth to

12:46.606 --> 12:47.806
is a bushel of russet potatoes.

12:47.840 --> 12:51.777
You know, when Michael
Bolton impregnated me,

12:51.811 --> 12:54.880
he called in a favor from his
old friend Kenny G, who stood

12:54.914 --> 12:57.482
at the foot of our bed
and serenaded us on soprano sax

12:57.517 --> 13:01.953
as Michael used every
inch of his enormous,

13:01.988 --> 13:04.756
silky-smooth vocal range

13:04.791 --> 13:08.493
to soothe me into a state
of relaxation so deep,

13:08.528 --> 13:11.563
it could only be described
as religious.

13:11.597 --> 13:13.532
I'm serious, Will.

13:13.566 --> 13:15.967
I was looser than a
Reno slot machine.

13:16.002 --> 13:17.736
Punkin', it don't matter

13:17.770 --> 13:19.738
if you got a
she-goat in heat.

13:19.772 --> 13:21.707
You still gotta calm
her down before you

13:21.741 --> 13:23.508
knock her up.

13:23.543 --> 13:25.344
That's a saying
where I come from.

13:25.378 --> 13:26.478
And where do you come from?

13:26.512 --> 13:27.979
It seems like a dude ranch

13:28.014 --> 13:29.314
on a nuclear waste site.

13:29.349 --> 13:31.316
What I mean is,

13:31.351 --> 13:33.585
if you're ready to get pregnant,

13:33.619 --> 13:35.020
you gotta make it real natural.

13:35.054 --> 13:36.855
It'll take the pressure
off of both of yous.

13:36.889 --> 13:40.025
If you and Emma are
ready to start trying,

13:40.059 --> 13:41.660
you got to stop trying.

13:47.233 --> 13:49.034
Attention McKinley students.
I have just

13:49.068 --> 13:51.770
been informed that the
McKinley High Student Council

13:51.804 --> 13:54.840
has voted to approve the
First Annual Senior Lock-In

13:54.874 --> 13:56.007
this weekend.

13:57.777 --> 13:59.544
And I regret to inform you

13:59.579 --> 14:01.213
that I'm cancelling this event,

14:01.247 --> 14:03.248
due to budget cuts,
safety concerns,

14:03.282 --> 14:04.716
and... oh, I don't know...

14:04.751 --> 14:06.818
let's say Obamacare.

14:18.264 --> 14:20.198
Oh, Tina... oh, my gosh,
are you okay?

14:20.233 --> 14:22.734
The lock-in was cancelled!

14:22.769 --> 14:24.269
Oh, Tina, why are you

14:24.303 --> 14:26.204
so worried about it? We just
thought of that yesterday.

14:26.239 --> 14:29.274
I know it would have been
our first lock-in, Blaine,

14:29.308 --> 14:30.876
but it would have been
our last lock-in,

14:30.910 --> 14:33.412
Blaine, and now,
we don't have that at all!

14:33.446 --> 14:35.414
Every day that passes
is another day

14:35.448 --> 14:38.049
closer to never
seeing each other ever again!

14:38.084 --> 14:40.519
Okay, okay,
okay, okay, um, uh...

14:40.553 --> 14:43.889
How about this? How about...
how about we, um, have

14:43.923 --> 14:46.258
- our own lock-in? Just
the three of us? - Yeah.

14:46.292 --> 14:48.126
How would we manage that?

14:48.161 --> 14:49.528
Easy.
Here's what we'll do, okay?

14:49.562 --> 14:51.329
We'll climb in through one
of the choir room windows.

14:51.364 --> 14:52.431
We'll leave one unlocked,

14:52.465 --> 14:53.732
and no one will ever notice.

14:53.766 --> 14:55.767
Yeah, how about it, Tina?
What do you say?

14:55.802 --> 14:57.669
All right.
Let's get you up.

14:57.703 --> 14:59.171
- Let's get you out of here.
- Okay.

14:59.205 --> 15:01.273
Now, Tina, I've been
meaning to ask you.

15:01.307 --> 15:03.575
Are your boobs getting bigger?

15:03.609 --> 15:04.776
Is it possible?

15:04.811 --> 15:06.611
Yes. Yes, they are, Sam.

15:06.646 --> 15:08.647
Thank you.
You're the best.

15:16.722 --> 15:18.423
Lady Hummel, come here.

15:18.458 --> 15:20.625
I need your tiny,
delicate, elfin-like fingers

15:20.660 --> 15:22.160
to help me fasten this weave.

15:22.195 --> 15:23.662
Ugh.

15:23.696 --> 15:26.031
It's Elliott, actually.

15:26.065 --> 15:27.732
And... that's a lot of hair.

15:27.767 --> 15:31.169
I will take that as a compliment.
Okay.

15:31.204 --> 15:33.038
It's all a part of my master
plan to psyche out Berry

15:33.072 --> 15:34.272
so I can play Fanny Brice.

15:34.307 --> 15:35.974
First comes
some amazing new hair,

15:36.008 --> 15:38.477
then, incredibly sexy
rehearsal clothes,

15:38.511 --> 15:39.845
which she could never pull off,

15:39.879 --> 15:42.447
and then I'm gonna sneak
into the theatre and tack up

15:42.482 --> 15:44.316
yearbook photos of her
from sophomore year,

15:44.350 --> 15:46.985
when she was a chunky little
butterball, just to remind her...

15:47.019 --> 15:48.820
hey, once a fatty,
always a fatty.

15:48.855 --> 15:51.223
God as my witness,
I will break her down.

15:51.257 --> 15:53.024
Oh, girl,
this is so high school.

15:53.059 --> 15:54.326
Okay, life is very high school,

15:54.360 --> 15:56.194
just with bigger stakes,
and if you knew Berry

15:56.229 --> 15:58.563
the way that all of us did,
you would be applauding me.

15:58.598 --> 15:59.898
In the beginning,
it's all sunshine

15:59.932 --> 16:02.200
and giggles and stickers,
and then, the second

16:02.235 --> 16:03.702
that you want the
same thing as her,

16:03.736 --> 16:06.938
a dark cloud comes over
her whiskery little chin.

16:06.973 --> 16:08.273
And she will chew you up

16:08.307 --> 16:10.709
and spit you out,
like a Jewish Hillary Clinton.

16:12.445 --> 16:15.413
You know, I... I'm actually just
here to get her sheet music.

16:15.448 --> 16:17.315
Do you know where she keeps it?
Up her butt.

16:17.350 --> 16:19.851
Seriously. She asked me to come
here and pick it up, and,

16:19.886 --> 16:21.586
you know,
she's moving into my apartment.

16:21.621 --> 16:23.054
Whoa!

16:23.089 --> 16:26.191
Wait. Wh-Wh-What
did you just say?!

16:26.225 --> 16:27.492
How could you do this to me?

16:27.527 --> 16:28.760
You are such a traitor!

16:28.794 --> 16:30.829
Well, A: I hardly know you,

16:30.863 --> 16:32.230
so I'm not really
being a traitor.

16:32.265 --> 16:34.432
And B: she needed a place
to stay, and I needed the money.

16:34.467 --> 16:36.635
You need money?
Well, yeah.

16:36.669 --> 16:41.740
Huh. Well, maybe Auntie Snixx
could help you out with that.

Okay, you made this way more
difficult than it needed to be?

17:06.566 --> 17:09.000
Just for the record.

17:09.035 --> 17:11.036
Oh.

17:13.806 --> 17:16.174
Any excuse
to put on that costume.

17:16.208 --> 17:18.977
Well, it's the last chance
I get to put it on,

17:19.011 --> 17:20.744
unless I'm in some kind
of creepy fetish club.

17:20.780 --> 17:22.480
Shh. Did you guys hear that?
Hear what?

Let's get this party started!

19:52.895 --> 19:55.997
11-hour energies for everybody!

19:56.031 --> 19:59.200
Uh, we don't want
to be rude, but...

19:59.235 --> 20:01.135
I can't hear you, Chang-Chang!

20:01.170 --> 20:02.737
I'm too busy drinkin'

20:02.771 --> 20:05.373
my 11-hour energies!
Oh, yeah, baby!

20:05.407 --> 20:06.875
Don't you think you need
to slow down a little bit

20:06.909 --> 20:08.042
on the energy
drinks there, Becky?

20:08.077 --> 20:09.978
By the way, how did
you even get in here?

20:10.012 --> 20:12.981
I climbed
through the window, fool!

20:15.284 --> 20:16.651
It's time for Twister!

20:16.685 --> 20:19.587
Every time you fall down,
you drink one of these.

20:19.622 --> 20:20.488
Becky, we'll die.

20:21.690 --> 20:23.258
Party in the U.S.A.!

20:23.292 --> 20:24.826
All right, that-that
sounds really fun,

20:24.860 --> 20:26.194
um, but we were thinking

20:26.228 --> 20:28.396
that we would just do
our own thing tonight.

20:28.430 --> 20:29.764
Think again, Gay Blaine!

20:29.798 --> 20:31.633
If you don't play
Twister with me,

20:31.667 --> 20:33.768
I'm calling the cops.

20:33.802 --> 20:35.236
Oh, snap!

20:43.979 --> 20:46.080
What did you do
to the craft room?

20:46.115 --> 20:48.449
Finally cleared it all out.

20:48.484 --> 20:50.451
You know, the only work of art

20:50.486 --> 20:53.221
that belongs in here is the one
we're gonna make together.

20:53.255 --> 20:55.456
Wait, are you setting up
the nursery?

20:55.491 --> 20:57.292
Well, that's bad luck.
We haven't even conceived yet.

20:57.326 --> 20:58.326
You worry too much.

20:58.360 --> 20:59.494
You're just figuring
that out now?

20:59.528 --> 21:01.429
We <i>both</i> worry too much.

21:01.463 --> 21:03.398
My dreams aren't big, Emma.

21:03.432 --> 21:07.235
I don't want to go to the moon
or play third base for the Reds.

21:07.269 --> 21:09.304
I just want to teach art to kids

21:09.338 --> 21:12.106
and have a family
with the girl of my dreams.

21:12.141 --> 21:15.076
The girl of your dreams probably
has a more fertile womb.

21:15.110 --> 21:17.478
Hey, all the doctors said
that everything was fine

21:17.513 --> 21:18.913
for both of us.

21:18.948 --> 21:20.748
We just need to
relax and enjoy this.

21:20.783 --> 21:23.351
We're so afraid of
letting each other down

21:23.385 --> 21:25.587
that-that all there is
in our home is fear.

21:25.621 --> 21:27.188
What baby's going
to want to be born

21:27.222 --> 21:29.123
into that space? Not mine.

21:30.159 --> 21:32.293
I love you so much.

21:32.328 --> 21:34.195
I love you, too.

21:34.229 --> 21:36.130
Then let's just enjoy the fact

21:36.165 --> 21:38.800
that we finally found our one
and only true loves

21:38.834 --> 21:40.301
and see what magical
little spirit wants

21:40.336 --> 21:42.270
to come along and
join us for the ride.

21:42.304 --> 21:44.539
Mind giving me a hand?

21:45.574 --> 21:48.142

Ah-ha-ha-ha!
You lose again!

24:06.348 --> 24:07.315
Time-out.

24:07.349 --> 24:09.183
I-I'm getting a cramp
in my leg.

24:09.218 --> 24:11.686
How long have
Sam and Tina been gone?

24:11.720 --> 24:13.821
Oh, who <i>cares?</i>

24:13.856 --> 24:15.523
Tina is boring.

24:15.557 --> 24:17.692
I hate Sam's haircut.

24:17.726 --> 24:19.894
It makes his forehead
look too big.

24:19.928 --> 24:23.097
You know what? I'm gonna...
walk this cramp off.

24:23.132 --> 24:25.099
Okay.

24:25.134 --> 24:28.136
When you come back,
I'll be here.

24:29.671 --> 24:31.873
I can have
some more energy drinks.

24:33.475 --> 24:35.276
Sam?

24:35.310 --> 24:37.145
Tina?

24:39.181 --> 24:41.282
Tina?

24:46.088 --> 24:48.790
Oh! What the hell
are you doing?!

24:48.824 --> 24:50.525
Uh, nothing!
Nothing!

24:50.559 --> 24:52.126
What about Nurse Penny, Sam?

24:52.161 --> 24:53.561
What, did you just
forget about her?

24:53.562 --> 24:56.197
And, Tina, you're just, ugh!

24:56.231 --> 24:58.833
Oh, I can't! I'm sorry, it
was the 11-hour energies!

24:58.867 --> 25:01.502
- And cheap, sordid nostalgia. - This
was supposed to be <i>our</i> night.

25:01.537 --> 25:03.304
<i>Our</i> little family,

25:03.338 --> 25:05.673
<i>our</i> friendly threesome.

25:05.707 --> 25:09.510
It was our last chance
to hang out together, and you...

25:09.545 --> 25:11.379
you ruined it.

25:11.413 --> 25:13.548
Actually, that was Becky!
With her Twister!

25:15.951 --> 25:16.818
Blaine, come back!

25:22.062 --> 25:24.830
Rachel, you're late! I'm
sorry, I was at a fitting.

25:24.865 --> 25:26.933
Table Five... they've
been waiting for you.

25:26.967 --> 25:28.301
Well, here we go.

25:28.335 --> 25:31.270
- Hi, Rachel.
- What's going on here?

25:31.305 --> 25:33.439
What's going on here? We have
a fatwa against her, remember?

25:33.473 --> 25:35.575
Actually, I am paying
Eliot to run lines with me,

25:35.609 --> 25:37.143
and they are going
to be letter-perfect

25:37.177 --> 25:38.878
by the time <i>you</i> have
the tragic accident

25:38.912 --> 25:41.314
that sidelines you and leaves
you horribly disfigured.

25:41.348 --> 25:43.249
Or did that already happen?
I can't...

25:43.283 --> 25:44.383
Okay, for the millionth time,

25:44.418 --> 25:45.885
that is never,
ever going to happen.

25:45.919 --> 25:47.587
I gave you the apartment,
I gave you Kurt,

25:47.621 --> 25:48.888
and you are never...
let me repeat...

25:48.922 --> 25:50.223
ever gonna play this part.
Ever, okay?

25:50.257 --> 25:51.737
But you can't take
my new best friend.

25:51.758 --> 25:52.725
You don't own him, Rachel.

25:52.759 --> 25:53.793
I'm not speaking to you,
traitor!

25:53.827 --> 25:56.562
Rachel, Table Three
is requesting a number.

25:56.597 --> 25:59.865
The husband and his wife
have been coming here every year

25:59.900 --> 26:01.167
for the wife's birthday.

26:01.201 --> 26:03.502
Her name is Gloria,
and she requested

26:03.537 --> 26:06.038
a certain song be performed.

26:06.073 --> 26:07.540
"Happy Birthday"?

26:07.574 --> 26:09.575
"Gloria" by Laura Branigan.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.477
Okay, well, Ronnie,
in that case, even though

26:11.511 --> 26:14.013
I'm off duty, I think
I'll take the lead on this one,

26:14.047 --> 26:16.048
since Rachel obviously
couldn't handle that song.

26:16.083 --> 26:17.216
Come on, bestie, back me up.

26:17.251 --> 26:19.385
Oh, you know, why don't you
back both of us up, and then

26:19.419 --> 26:22.154

28:51.438 --> 28:54.540

28:54.574 --> 28:56.709
I'm not gonna pick sides or

28:56.743 --> 28:58.064

you have to.

28:58.078 --> 29:00.246

29:03.016 --> 29:05.418
I'm done... I'm done with the band.
Yeah. What?

29:05.452 --> 29:07.253

can find a new singing partner.

29:07.287 --> 29:08.654

to this kind of drama,

29:12.592 --> 29:13.526
but I'm not.

29:13.560 --> 29:15.394
I'm over it.

29:16.393 --> 29:18.073
Blaine,
come on, wait up.

29:18.098 --> 29:19.665
I can't even look
at either of you...

29:19.699 --> 29:22.268
that's how grossed out I am. Please stop.
We owe you an apology.

29:22.302 --> 29:24.603
Yes, yes, you do.
The whole point of this lock-in

29:24.638 --> 29:26.972
was for the three of us
to have fun together.

29:27.007 --> 29:29.308
Instead, the two of you run off
and make it about yourselves

29:29.342 --> 29:32.878
with your making out
and your gross boob talk.

29:32.913 --> 29:34.146
Blaine, Sam and I just needed

29:34.181 --> 29:36.061
- to get it out of our system.
- Yeah, we tried

29:36.082 --> 29:38.517
making out and it was hot and
everything, but we decided that

29:38.552 --> 29:40.085
we both don't want
to be a couple.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.487
Exactly. We just
needed to explore

29:41.521 --> 29:42.922
the possibility,
and now it's over.

29:42.956 --> 29:44.690
It was a silly senior fling.
That's right.

29:44.724 --> 29:46.959
Now I'm back to finding Tina
not attractive again, okay?

29:46.993 --> 29:49.328
So, look, Tina and I,
we don't want to be a duet;

29:49.362 --> 29:51.430
we want to be a trio again,
the three of us.

29:51.465 --> 29:52.998
Why don't the three
of us hang out tonight,

29:53.033 --> 29:55.668
no Twister, no making out,
no Becky.

29:55.702 --> 29:57.803
No. We tried that,
and you ruined it.

29:57.838 --> 30:00.439
You know, I turned down bumper
bowling with Kitty and Artie...

30:00.449 --> 30:02.250
and you know how much
I love bumper bowling...

30:02.275 --> 30:03.542
I turned it down
because I figured

30:03.577 --> 30:04.777
they were just gonna
make out the whole time,

30:04.811 --> 30:06.345
and I didn't want
to be a third wheel.

30:06.379 --> 30:09.515
Fifth wheel. And then, lo and
behold, the two of you run off

30:09.549 --> 30:10.883
during <i>our</i> fun night

30:10.917 --> 30:13.385
of shenanigans and mischief,
and you turn it into

30:13.420 --> 30:14.620
some kind of creepy

30:14.654 --> 30:16.021
face-sucking slurp-a-thon
which I still

30:16.056 --> 30:17.323
can't get out of my head!

30:17.357 --> 30:19.825
So I guess you guys
can just have fun

30:19.860 --> 30:21.327
hanging out
by yourselves tonight

30:21.361 --> 30:24.096
and... fondle each other's
boobs, or whatever.

30:27.334 --> 30:30.536
I mean...
do you want to?

30:33.599 --> 30:35.679
There's no point in trying
to broker the peace, Kurt.

30:35.704 --> 30:38.072
- I am not interested.
- Neither am I.

30:38.106 --> 30:40.508
Although, if you can clear out
some space for us here,

30:40.542 --> 30:42.576
I would be happy to settle
this Lima Heights style.

30:42.611 --> 30:44.512
Two men enter, one man leaves.

30:44.546 --> 30:46.814
Okay, I'm gonna give you both
one more chance

30:46.848 --> 30:49.283
to put the stupidity aside
and act like adults.

30:49.317 --> 30:50.518
Okay, my feelings
are my feelings, Kurt,

30:50.552 --> 30:52.253
and they're not gonna change,
even if Santana

30:52.287 --> 30:54.321
admits that she was wrong.
You broke this.

30:54.356 --> 30:56.590
I'm gonna broke something, but
you are literally You broke it.

30:56.625 --> 30:58.926
The most selfish bitch
I've ever met.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.127
Okay, we promised
each other that

31:00.162 --> 31:01.962
we would stick by each other
for two years,

31:01.997 --> 31:04.265
and you guys haven't lasted
for two months,

31:04.299 --> 31:06.000
because you don't care
about anyone but yourselves.

31:06.034 --> 31:07.101
How about me?

31:07.135 --> 31:09.103
How about the fact
that I lost my roommates, huh?

31:09.137 --> 31:10.657
Or the fact that
you scared off Elliott

31:10.672 --> 31:12.206
and now he wants
to quit the band?

31:12.240 --> 31:14.075
This has nothing to do
with the band, Kurt, okay?

31:14.109 --> 31:15.776
Santana and I are both professionals.
Exactly.

31:15.811 --> 31:18.579
Blink 182 hated each other and
still found a way to continue

31:18.613 --> 31:20.448
to suck as a band for years.
Oh, you know, you guys

31:20.482 --> 31:22.016
don't have to worry about
the band, because you're out.

31:22.050 --> 31:23.784
What?!
Pamela Lansbury is dead.

31:23.819 --> 31:25.486
I'm starting a new band
with Elliott and Danny.

31:25.520 --> 31:27.788
It's gonna be a trio.
Okay, wait, so my own girlfriend

31:27.823 --> 31:29.490
agreed to kick me out
of the band?

31:29.524 --> 31:31.392
Your girlfriend wants
to sing and have fun,

31:31.426 --> 31:33.961
and she knows that's impossible
with you still in the band.

31:33.995 --> 31:37.364
Okay, here is a flyer
for our first gig.

31:37.399 --> 31:39.200
I hope the two of you
can declare an armistice

31:39.201 --> 31:42.536
long enough to come and watch us play.
Thank you, Kurt.

31:42.571 --> 31:44.472
Well, Santana, I hope
that you can rise above,

31:44.506 --> 31:46.507
because I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Okay, well, just

31:46.541 --> 31:48.576
make sure that you stay
on your side of the club, dwarf.

31:48.610 --> 31:51.979
I think I saw a squirrel come
out of the back of your hair.

32:02.324 --> 32:06.193
Okay, look, the way I see it is
we have two options right now.

32:06.228 --> 32:09.396
One, we can have an all-out catfight
right here in the middle of this bar...

32:09.431 --> 32:11.398
Which I would win.
Or...

32:11.433 --> 32:13.534
for the sake of Kurt, we could
just pretend to be friends,

32:13.568 --> 32:15.202
even if it's just for tonight.
Fine.

32:15.237 --> 32:16.937
But just for tonight,
and only because

32:16.972 --> 32:19.707
I don't want to get your blood
all over my outfit.

32:19.741 --> 32:21.142
Hello, everybody.

32:21.176 --> 32:22.710
I'm Kurt, and welcome.

32:22.744 --> 32:24.612
I know most of you
were excited to see

32:24.646 --> 32:26.413
Pamela Lansbury perform tonight,

32:26.448 --> 32:29.049
but unfortunately,
I have some sad news.

32:29.084 --> 32:32.386
Pamela Lansbury... <i>c'est fini.</i>

32:32.420 --> 32:34.288
What?!
Yeah, but do not worry,

32:34.322 --> 32:36.791
because rising from the ashes
like a phoenix,

32:36.825 --> 32:39.293
I give you New York's
new singing thruple...

32:39.327 --> 32:40.628
One Three Hill!

32:44.132 --> 32:45.399
Thank you.

32:45.433 --> 32:46.634
Thank you.

32:46.668 --> 32:49.270
Uh, you know, a year ago,
had someone asked me

32:49.304 --> 32:51.672
if I thought I'd ever be
a part of a singing trio,

32:51.706 --> 32:53.140
I would have said absolutely.

32:53.175 --> 32:55.676
Maybe not this
combination exactly,

32:55.710 --> 32:57.344
as amazing as they are,

32:57.379 --> 33:00.114
Shut up and sing! but, uh...
I guess it's like what they say.

33:00.148 --> 33:03.918
Life is one long and windy road,

33:03.952 --> 33:05.686
and you're never sure
what might happen.

Why are you digging
through my panty drawer, lezzie?

35:20.503 --> 35:22.304
Well, because before
this drawer was filled

35:22.338 --> 35:24.573
with crotchless panties
and stripper bras... ah...

35:24.607 --> 35:27.042
it was my scented
candle drawer.

35:27.077 --> 35:29.197
Elliott's lovely but he seems
to only know how to cook

35:29.212 --> 35:30.479
with cumin and curry.

35:30.513 --> 35:32.481
Okay, can we just talk
for a second about how you used

35:32.515 --> 35:34.983
to have an entire drawer
dedicated to scented candles?

35:35.018 --> 35:36.685
Maybe another time.

35:36.719 --> 35:38.687
You know, it's funny,
but I realized

35:38.721 --> 35:40.222
that I really don't have
any other girl friends here

35:40.256 --> 35:42.191
in New York City, and you were
sort of my only one.

35:42.225 --> 35:43.692
Well, maybe you should take that
as a sign

35:43.726 --> 35:45.427
of your horrible personality
disorder.

35:45.462 --> 35:47.096
I'm sorry, but I don't see you
perusing around town

35:47.130 --> 35:48.931
having cocktails with any
of your gal pals.

35:48.965 --> 35:52.334
Okay. I guess we didn't have
a lot of girl friends

35:52.368 --> 35:54.169
in high school.
Brittany doesn't count

35:54.204 --> 35:56.805
'cause I was in love with her.
And I guess I had Quinn but...

35:56.840 --> 35:58.674
the fact that she lives
an hour away and I never

35:58.708 --> 36:01.343
thought about calling her
should say something to me.

36:01.377 --> 36:04.012
Yeah. Sucks that we were all
so competitive about boys

36:04.047 --> 36:06.348
and solos.
I mean, you know,

36:06.382 --> 36:08.851
Kurt and Elliott are great,
but it's just different

36:08.885 --> 36:10.352
having someone
who really gets it.

36:11.855 --> 36:15.424
I just don't understand.
Like, why my part?

36:15.458 --> 36:16.992
Why my understudy?

36:17.026 --> 36:19.328
There was an opportunity
and I took it.

36:19.362 --> 36:20.662
You would have done
the same thing,

36:20.697 --> 36:22.531
and then you would
have fought to take down

36:22.565 --> 36:24.466
whoever was in your way.
Even if it was me.

36:26.102 --> 36:27.636
In New York City,

36:27.670 --> 36:29.238
ask for a black coffee...

36:29.272 --> 36:32.407
Well, you two in the same room
and there are no stitches?

36:32.442 --> 36:34.109
- That's an improvement.
- We were just gonna rehearse.

36:34.144 --> 36:36.645
Uh, Kurt picked out
the best trio song ever.

36:36.679 --> 36:38.480
I was just leaving.
Yeah, I'm gonna go, too.

36:38.515 --> 36:40.883
No, no, no, babe, stay.
It'll make me feel less guilty

36:40.917 --> 36:43.719
about being okay with Kurt
kicking you out of the band.

36:43.753 --> 36:46.555
I have to go to work.
Hey, for the record,

36:46.589 --> 36:47.789
I think you guys
are both amazing.

36:47.824 --> 36:49.791
If you manage to patch
things up at some point,

36:49.826 --> 36:52.361
I would love to sing
with either of you or...

36:52.395 --> 36:54.229
cook some curry.

36:54.264 --> 36:55.430
We all would.

36:55.465 --> 36:56.765
Right, well,

36:56.799 --> 36:58.534
I don't really see
that happening any time soon,

36:58.568 --> 36:59.801
and I have to go to rehearsal.

36:59.836 --> 37:02.738
Excuse me.
You're a traitor.

37:02.772 --> 37:04.306
Bye.

37:08.778 --> 37:10.078
Hey.

37:10.113 --> 37:11.613
Hey.

37:13.583 --> 37:16.385
So, I thought you were gonna
climb in through the window.

37:16.419 --> 37:19.388
I think I'm retiring my cape.

37:19.422 --> 37:22.057
Guess you're outgrowing
a lot of things.

37:22.091 --> 37:23.659
No, I freaked out.

37:23.693 --> 37:25.294
And I was wrong and I'm sorry.

37:25.328 --> 37:26.828
I thought we were gonna have

37:26.863 --> 37:29.998
the perfect senior year,
and the one that we got

37:30.033 --> 37:33.969
has been so weird
and really hard.

37:34.003 --> 37:36.004
Yeah. And so when
I tried to plan

37:36.039 --> 37:37.873
the perfect night out
and it didn't go the way that...

37:37.907 --> 37:40.275
that I'd hoped, I-I flipped out.

37:41.978 --> 37:44.513
And I guess I found it shocking
to find two people kissing

37:44.547 --> 37:46.982
that I never really
expected to find kissing,

37:47.016 --> 37:50.018
but, really, that happens
all the time around here.

37:50.053 --> 37:51.853
It does. Yeah. You
were right, Tina.

37:51.888 --> 37:53.522
Everything is changing,

37:53.556 --> 37:55.624
and I get why you
want to try everything

37:55.658 --> 37:56.758
before it changes for good.

37:56.793 --> 37:58.627
But the one thing I
can promise is

37:58.661 --> 38:01.630
not gonna change is that we are
gonna be friends forever.

38:01.664 --> 38:03.098
Mm-hmm.
I like the sound of that.

38:03.132 --> 38:05.033
I'm sorry, guys.

38:06.069 --> 38:07.836
What do you all think's
gonna happen

38:07.870 --> 38:09.037
to this place when we leave?

38:09.072 --> 38:10.906
I mean, there's only
gonna be, like,

38:10.940 --> 38:13.075
three kids in the glee club.
It feels so weird

38:13.109 --> 38:15.077
to think about Glee Club
going on without us.

38:15.111 --> 38:16.912
Well, at least
we can leave them with

38:16.946 --> 38:19.214
a second national championship
to remember us with.

38:19.249 --> 38:20.782
- Ménage-a-gross.
- Hey, Artie,

38:20.817 --> 38:22.184
uh, you want to join us? We're
just having, like, a little

38:22.218 --> 38:24.019
senior moment if you want to,
you know, take part.

38:24.053 --> 38:26.989
No, I don't want
to interrupt your power trio.

38:31.160 --> 38:33.829
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

38:33.863 --> 38:35.063
All right.

38:35.098 --> 38:37.399
Come on.

38:37.433 --> 38:38.934
Okay!

38:38.968 --> 38:39.868
Ladies and gentlemen,

38:39.902 --> 38:42.170
one week until nationals.

38:44.774 --> 38:47.709
Okay, I was planning
on ordering dinner in

38:47.744 --> 38:50.178
and working you guys deep into
the night, but then I realized

38:50.213 --> 38:52.714
that worrying too much about
what you're trying to accomplish

38:52.749 --> 38:55.384
actually gets in the way of what
you're trying to accomplish.

38:55.418 --> 38:57.819
And as a coach

38:57.854 --> 39:00.088
who knows what a national
championship team looks like,

39:00.123 --> 39:01.256
I have to say...

39:02.625 --> 39:04.192
you guys are ready.

39:04.227 --> 39:07.829
Love you!

39:07.864 --> 39:10.198
Except for one thing.

39:10.233 --> 39:13.268
Don't forget your sunblock

39:13.303 --> 39:14.569
because this time next week,

39:14.604 --> 39:16.438
we are gonna be
in sunny Los Angeles.

39:18.908 --> 39:20.809
Wait, Mr. Shue, Mr. Shue.

39:20.843 --> 39:23.412
So, for us seniors,
this is one of our last

39:23.446 --> 39:25.247
Glee Club meetings.
It's kind of a big deal.

39:25.281 --> 39:27.249
We were wondering if we
could just do one last number.

39:27.283 --> 39:30.123
Yes, please. And we wanted to ask Artie
to be a part of the trio with us.

39:30.153 --> 39:31.586
Yeah, if memory serves,

39:31.621 --> 39:32.988
a quartet is 25% more powerful.

39:33.022 --> 39:34.523
We're just a little slow
at the math.

39:35.558 --> 39:38.527

You better start packing.

42:10.746 --> 42:13.048
I know how you like to
vacuum-pack all your stuff.

42:13.082 --> 42:14.983
Mm.

42:15.017 --> 42:17.519
Um...

42:17.553 --> 42:19.688
I don't think
I'm gonna go with you.

42:19.722 --> 42:21.556
You better go.

42:21.591 --> 42:23.058
Hey, you're our good luck charm.

42:23.092 --> 42:24.359
And, besides,

42:24.393 --> 42:27.929
we can't miss a prime week
of baby-making time.

42:27.964 --> 42:30.098
Well...

42:30.132 --> 42:32.400
we can if one
has already been made.

42:35.238 --> 42:36.738
I'm pregnant.

42:36.772 --> 42:39.207
Oh, my God.

42:39.242 --> 42:41.676
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

42:41.711 --> 42:42.944
This is amazing!

42:42.979 --> 42:45.380
Wait, wait, wait.
Are-are you really pregnant

42:45.414 --> 42:46.548
or are just pretending to be?
Because last time

42:46.582 --> 42:47.549
somebody told me
they were pregnant,

42:47.583 --> 42:49.050
it was really bad...

42:49.085 --> 42:50.452
Listen, listen...
the doctor confirmed it.

42:50.486 --> 42:52.587
I'm really, really pregnant
with your baby, Will.

42:52.622 --> 42:53.755
I'm gonna have your baby.

42:53.789 --> 42:57.392
Oh... mmm... Oh, my God.

42:57.426 --> 42:59.561
We're gonna be a real family.

42:59.595 --> 43:01.730
Just the three of us.

43:01.764 --> 43:04.833
Oh, I love you so much.
Oh.
