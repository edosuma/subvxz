WE END THIS SHIT TONIGHT.

02:34.686 --> 02:38.387
"DESTROY EVERYTHING."

02:38.389 --> 02:42.993
IS THIS THE MESSAGE WE WANT
TO SEND OUR CHILDREN

02:42.995 --> 02:45.561
FOR GENERATIONS TO COME?

02:45.563 --> 02:49.401
"DESTROY... EVERYTHING."

02:52.937 --> 02:55.939
THIS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

02:55.941 --> 02:58.408
IS WHAT THAT
WEAPON-WIELDING GOON WORE

02:58.410 --> 03:01.577
THE NIGHT OF THE ALTERCATION.

03:01.579 --> 03:02.713
LOOKS TO ME LIKE

03:02.715 --> 03:04.584
HE WAS ON
A MISSION TO KILL.

03:08.821 --> 03:11.821
COMBAT BOOTS,

03:11.823 --> 03:12.924
WAR CHAINS...

03:16.762 --> 03:18.695
AND THIS.

03:18.697 --> 03:20.897
"DESTROY EVERYTHING."

03:25.069 --> 03:26.470
HOW'S IT GOING, NEW YORK?

03:26.472 --> 03:29.940
I CHOSE TO SPEAK TO YOU
IN A SQUARE

03:29.942 --> 03:33.476
BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE KIND OF
CONDITIONED TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE,

03:33.478 --> 03:34.910
WHEN THEY'RE IN
THE SHAPE OF A SQUARE.

03:34.912 --> 03:38.013
AND ALSO, HERE IN HOLLYWOOD,

03:38.015 --> 03:41.517
THIS IS WHERE WE GIVE PEOPLE
WHAT THEY WANT.

03:41.519 --> 03:45.888
VIOLENCE, I GUESS THAT'S WHAT
IT SEEMS TO COME DOWN TO.

03:45.890 --> 03:48.124
WHAT I WANTED TO TALK TO
EVERYONE TODAY ABOUT,

03:48.126 --> 03:50.126
UH... I DON'T REALLY
WANT TO PREACH,

03:50.128 --> 03:52.963
I JUST WANT TO, MORE,
BRING UP SOME QUESTIONS.

03:52.965 --> 03:54.831
AND SINCE I ALWAYS
TEND TO BE

03:54.833 --> 03:59.435
A SCAPEGOAT, I THOUGHT
WE'D TALK ABOUT BLAME.

03:59.437 --> 04:01.104
RIGHT NOW,
EVERYBODY WANTS TO BLAME MUSIC,

04:01.106 --> 04:02.172
THEY WANT TO
BLAME MOVIES,

04:02.174 --> 04:04.741
BUT, UH... YOU KNOW,

04:04.743 --> 04:07.110
WE'VE FORGOTTEN
THAT WE HAVE A DEAD GUY

04:07.112 --> 04:10.179
HANGING FROM A TREE
IN OUR LIVING ROOMS.

04:10.181 --> 04:12.047
UH... UH...

04:12.049 --> 04:14.583
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE
WORSHIPPED ALL OUR LIVES.

04:14.585 --> 04:16.952
IF YOU THINK ABOUT
THE CRUCIFIX AS THE...

04:16.954 --> 04:18.922
THE GREATEST MASS-MARKET

04:18.923 --> 04:21.624
PIECE OF MERCHANDISE
IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.

04:21.625 --> 04:23.660
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND IT
TO BE KIND OF INTERESTING.

04:23.662 --> 04:27.097
WE HAVEN'T REALLY SAT DOWN AND
TALKED ABOUT THAT ON THE NEWS.

04:27.099 --> 04:28.898
UM... ALSO, WONDERED

04:28.900 --> 04:30.667
WHY NOBODY CARES WHEN

04:30.669 --> 04:32.835
AN ADULT COMMITS SOME
SENSELESS ACT OF VIOLENCE

04:32.837 --> 04:33.836
THEY WANT TO HAVE

04:33.838 --> 04:35.472
A REASON WHY.

04:35.474 --> 04:37.674
THAT'S ONLY WHEN
A KID DOES IT.

04:37.676 --> 04:39.943
BUT I THINK WHAT'S REALLY...

04:39.945 --> 04:42.511
BEGUN TO CONFUSE PEOPLE NOW

04:42.513 --> 04:43.679
AND WHY WE'RE IN THIS STATE

04:43.681 --> 04:45.982
OF... UH, CHAOS

04:45.984 --> 04:50.520
AND, UH, PC, NONSENSICAL,
UPTIGHTNESS.

04:50.522 --> 04:52.689
IT'S WHITE TEENAGERS.

04:52.691 --> 04:54.191
THAT'S THE REAL ENIGMA.

04:54.193 --> 04:55.592
WHY ARE THEY MAD?

04:55.594 --> 04:56.927
THEY'RE MIDDLE CLASS,

04:56.929 --> 04:58.627
THEY'RE WHITE,
THEY'RE SPOILED.

04:58.629 --> 05:01.465
IS IT BECAUSE THEY KNOW
AMERICA'S A LIE?

05:01.467 --> 05:03.699
IS IT BECAUSE
WE MAKE THEM FEEL

05:03.701 --> 05:06.102
LIKE THEY'RE NEVER
GOOD ENOUGH, YOU KNOW?

05:06.104 --> 05:07.636
"YOU'RE NEVER GOOD ENOUGH
FOR THE SCHOLARSHIP,

05:07.638 --> 05:10.573
FOR THE CAR, FOR THE GIRL.

05:10.575 --> 05:14.244
NEVER GOOD ENOUGH TO BE
FAMOUS FOR 15 MINUTES."

05:14.246 --> 05:17.013
AND THEN, ARE WE SURPRISED
WHY THEY'RE MAD

05:17.015 --> 05:19.249
OR WHY THEY END UP DEAD,
YOU KNOW?

05:19.251 --> 05:21.818
WHY THE VIOLENCE?

05:21.820 --> 05:23.920
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW...

05:23.922 --> 05:25.989
YOU MADE THEM, AMERICA.

05:25.991 --> 05:27.122
YOU KNOW,
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

05:32.498 --> 05:34.801
COME ON, GET YOUR GAME DAY

05:50.648 --> 05:53.215
WHY? I DON'T EVEN SEE WHY YOUR
BITCH-ASS NEEDS A HELMET ANYWAY.

05:53.217 --> 05:55.285
JV HAS NO BUSINESS
SUITING UP.

05:55.287 --> 05:56.285
COME ON NOW, RICKY.

05:56.287 --> 05:58.023
HE MIGHT SEE THE FIELD.

05:59.790 --> 06:01.824
WE'LL HAVE THEIR ASS BEAT
BY HALFTIME, YOU KNOW THAT.

06:01.826 --> 06:03.759
MCCORMICK, YOU ACT LIKE IT'S
HARD TO BE A LINEMAN, MAN.

06:03.761 --> 06:05.530
ALL YOU DO IS SIT ON
YOUR FAT ASS AND EAT.

06:07.566 --> 06:09.865
BUDDY, ONLY THING I'M EATING
IS YOUR MOM'S PUSSY.

06:12.703 --> 06:14.537
WHAT... GET...
GET THE FUCK OFF ME!

06:14.539 --> 06:16.706
QUIT FREAKIN' PLAYING

HALLOWED BY THY NAME.

06:28.587 --> 06:30.953

06:33.258 --> 06:35.624
GIVE US THIS DAY
OUR DAILY BREAD.

06:35.626 --> 06:37.160

06:37.162 --> 06:40.030
AS WE FORGIVE THOSE

06:40.032 --> 06:41.831
AND LEAD US NOT
INTO TEMPTATION,

06:41.833 --> 06:43.732
BUT DELIVER US FROM EVIL.

06:43.734 --> 06:45.035
FOR THINE IS THE KINGDOM,

HOW YOU WOULD
DESCRIBE YOURSELF,

18:11.656 --> 18:14.824
YOUR LIFESTYLE.

18:14.826 --> 18:16.459
I DON'T KNOW.

18:16.461 --> 18:17.960
PUNK?

18:17.962 --> 18:20.730
"PUNK"?

18:20.732 --> 18:22.201
FUNNY YOU WOULD SAY THAT.

18:24.034 --> 18:26.537
BECAUSE WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY...

18:28.372 --> 18:29.571
GIVES US

18:29.573 --> 18:31.773
THE FOLLOWING DEFINITION
OF THIS TERM

18:31.775 --> 18:37.746
YOU SO ELOQUENTLY USE
TO DESCRIBE YOURSELF: PUNK.

18:37.748 --> 18:40.782
"A WORTHLESS PERSON;

18:40.784 --> 18:43.918
AN OFTEN AGGRESSIVE
OR VIOLENT YOUNG MAN,

18:43.920 --> 18:47.790
USUALLY A PETTY HOODLUM
OR GANGSTER;

18:47.792 --> 18:48.961
A SOCIOPATH."

18:51.495 --> 18:54.062
IT'S NOT ABOUT
A DEFINITION.

18:54.064 --> 18:57.032
I WOULDN'T EXPECT
SOMEONE LIKE YOU...

18:57.034 --> 18:58.033
TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

18:58.035 --> 18:59.034
OH, WELL, THEN

18:59.036 --> 19:01.736
PLEASE HELP ME.

19:01.738 --> 19:03.606
HELP THE JURY UNDERSTAND

19:03.608 --> 19:05.074
HOW WEARING CHAINS
AND MILITARY CLOTHING

19:05.076 --> 19:08.677
IS JUST PART
OF THE STYLE,

19:08.679 --> 19:10.514
AND NOT WEAPONS
AT THE READY.

19:12.884 --> 19:14.684
IT'S A STATEMENT.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.351
OH, YOU ARE CORRECT,

19:16.353 --> 19:17.520
IT MOST CERTAINLY IS

19:17.522 --> 19:18.988
A STATEMENT.

19:18.990 --> 19:22.390
BUT IT IS NOT A STATEMENT
OF FASHION,

19:22.392 --> 19:25.060
IT'S A STATEMENT OF
MALICIOUS INTENT.

20:14.478 --> 20:16.648
MY HEAD'S POUNDING.

20:20.650 --> 20:23.388
IT'S NOT YOUR HEAD, MAN,
THERE'S SOMEONE AT THE DOOR.

20:35.565 --> 20:37.001
HERSCHEL,
WHAT'S HAPPENING, MAN?

20:38.535 --> 20:39.667
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

20:39.669 --> 20:41.002
RENT WAS DUE LAST WEEK.

20:41.004 --> 20:43.038
AH, I KNOW, I DO.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.408
I GOT A LITTLE BEHIND.

20:46.077 --> 20:47.378
HERE'S THIS.

20:50.782 --> 20:51.780
IT'S SHORT.

20:51.782 --> 20:53.581
I KNOW.

20:53.583 --> 20:55.084
BUT JUST GIVE US
A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME,

20:55.086 --> 20:56.788
AND I PROMISE
I'LL GET YOU THE REST.

20:58.188 --> 21:00.155
I LIKE YOU ALL
AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND ALL,

21:00.157 --> 21:01.690
BUT I NEED THE MONEY.

21:01.692 --> 21:03.024
I CAN'T HAVE Y'ALL
SQUATTING IN HERE.

21:03.026 --> 21:04.026
I'M ALREADY GIVING YOU

21:04.028 --> 21:06.494
A BREAK ON PRICE, MAN.

21:06.496 --> 21:07.863
I KNOW.

21:07.865 --> 21:09.197
AND WE APPRECIATE IT.

21:10.734 --> 21:11.733
I'M JUST... I'M TRYING.

21:11.735 --> 21:13.903
YOU KNOW, IT'S...

21:13.905 --> 21:15.905
DUDE, YOU KNOW
I'M GOOD FOR IT.

21:15.907 --> 21:18.607
THESE SHOWS, THEY'RE STARTING
TO GO REALLY WELL.

21:18.609 --> 21:19.841
I JUST NEED LIKE A WEEK

21:19.843 --> 21:23.145
AND I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

21:23.147 --> 21:24.579
ALL RIGHT, BUT THAT'S IT.

21:24.581 --> 21:26.182
ALL RIGHT?
I'M SERIOUS THIS TIME.

21:26.184 --> 21:28.216
I HONESTLY CAN'T WAIT
ANY LONGER, ALL RIGHT?

21:28.218 --> 21:31.153
ONE WEEK OR I GOT TO
LOCK IT UP, MAN.

21:31.155 --> 21:34.490
OKAY. AND, HERSCHEL,
THANK YOU.

21:34.492 --> 21:35.957
I PROMISE,
YOU WON'T REGRET THIS.

21:35.959 --> 21:37.626
- ALL RIGHT.

21:37.628 --> 21:38.661
THANK YOU.

21:38.663 --> 21:39.828
ONE WEEK!

21:51.775 --> 21:53.242
YOU KNOW, IT'S GONNA BE HARD

21:53.244 --> 21:55.543
FOR YOU TO GET A JOB
LOOKING LIKE A WILD INDIAN.

21:55.545 --> 21:57.613
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, OLD
MAN, I GOT A FEW THINGS LINED UP.

21:57.615 --> 21:59.418
OH, I'M NOT WORRIED,
THAT'S YOUR MOTHER'S JOB.

22:04.621 --> 22:06.155
I GUESS A HELMET'S OUT
OF THE QUESTION, TOO.

22:06.157 --> 22:07.490
I'M NOT TRYING
TO LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.994
YOU COULD'VE FOOLED ME.

22:13.830 --> 22:15.664
HOW DANGEROUS...

22:17.568 --> 22:20.168
THIS IS THE LAST
OF THE MEGADEATH WEAPONS.

22:20.170 --> 22:22.771
A HUGE BOMB, NINE MEGATONS.

22:22.773 --> 22:26.642
IT HAS MORE EXPLOSIVE POWER
THAN ALL THE MISSILES FIRED

22:26.644 --> 22:29.611
FROM ONE OF OUR NUCLEAR-ARMED
SUBMARINES TODAY.

22:29.613 --> 22:31.680
AND COULD BE DETONATED
BY A VARIETY OF WAYS:

22:31.682 --> 22:33.883
A SPARK, A LIGHTNING STORM

22:33.885 --> 22:35.751
OR EVEN A HIT
COULD SET IT OFF.

22:35.753 --> 22:38.686
BUT WE HAVE
DISMANTLED OTHERS LIKE THIS...

22:38.688 --> 22:40.588
WHO WERE YOU TALKING TO
OUT THERE?

22:40.590 --> 22:41.824
RAN INTO AN OLD FRIEND.

22:41.826 --> 22:43.091
TOLD YOU I'D COME.

22:43.093 --> 22:44.792
OH! WHO IS THIS?

22:44.794 --> 22:46.861
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK,
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN

22:46.863 --> 22:49.164
TO TRACY AND SHE'LL GIVE YOU
A GOOD HAIRCUT.

22:49.166 --> 22:50.566
OH!

22:50.568 --> 22:52.100
SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD IDEA TO ME.

22:52.102 --> 22:54.203
I SAY YOU JUST SHAVE
THE WHOLE THING.

22:54.205 --> 22:55.907
MAKE YOU LOOK
LIKE A REAL MAN.

22:57.073 --> 22:58.840
SMELLS GOOD, MA.

22:58.842 --> 23:02.544
- YOU MAKE ENOUGH FOR EVERYBODY?
- BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR BROTHER,

23:02.546 --> 23:03.546
I NEVER KNOW
WHO'S GONNA BE HERE

23:03.548 --> 23:05.548
SO I ALWAYS TRY.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.282
OH, AND YOU CAN TAKE SOME
TO YOUR FRIENDS, TOO.

23:07.284 --> 23:09.551
I'M SURE THEY COULD USE A GOOD
MEAL EVERY ONCE AND A WHILE.

23:09.553 --> 23:12.021
NOT TRYING TO FEED
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD.

23:16.260 --> 23:17.659
WHAT'S COOKING, BETTY?

23:17.661 --> 23:19.597
OH.

23:21.098 --> 23:23.299
- YUMMY.

23:23.301 --> 23:25.134
YOU KNOW,
IT'S STRANGE,

23:25.136 --> 23:27.001
I NEVER HEARD
ANYONE KNOCK.

23:27.003 --> 23:28.771
VERY FUNNY, MR. D.

23:28.773 --> 23:29.871

23:29.873 --> 23:30.873
HELP YOURSELF, JOHN.

23:30.875 --> 23:33.041
THANK YOU, BETTY.

23:33.043 --> 23:35.010
HEY, PASS THE EGGS, MAN.

23:35.012 --> 23:37.178
I AIN'T HERE
TO SERVE YOU.

23:37.180 --> 23:39.917
GET UP AND
GET THEM YOURSELF.

23:46.357 --> 23:47.956
YOU LOOKING FOR THIS?

23:47.958 --> 23:50.192
WHAT THE HELL, MOM?

23:50.194 --> 23:51.760
THE NAME OF YOUR BAND IS

23:51.762 --> 23:52.927
"WHITE SLAVE TRADERS"?

23:52.929 --> 23:55.299
WE'RE ALL SLAVES
TO AUTHORITY, MA.

24:21.759 --> 24:23.791
GET YOUR ASS OVER
HERE AND HELP ME REAL QUICK.

24:23.793 --> 24:26.161
DON'T TELL ME WHAT
TO DO, I'M AN ANARCHIST!

24:26.163 --> 24:27.963
KISS MY ASS.

24:27.965 --> 24:29.831
I WOULD, BUT I DON'T
WANT MY LIPS TO STINK.

24:31.267 --> 24:32.367
SHIT!

24:33.771 --> 24:35.303
OH, WELL.

24:35.305 --> 24:36.771
WHY DO WE
DO THIS SHIT, MAN?

24:36.773 --> 24:38.139
'CAUSE IT'S FUN!

24:38.141 --> 24:39.140
THIS IS WORK,
NOT FUN.

24:39.142 --> 24:40.643
IT'S BOTH.

24:40.645 --> 24:43.244
PLUS, WE'RE MAKING
A MARK ON THIS TOWN.

24:43.246 --> 24:45.780
THIS TOWN
DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

24:45.782 --> 24:47.182
SHIT, I KNOW, BUT...

24:47.184 --> 24:49.684
THAT "AMARILLIONARE"
GAVE US SOME EXTRA CASH.

24:49.686 --> 24:51.654
GOT TO LOVE THAT KOOKY BASTARD.

24:51.656 --> 24:54.322
YEP, HE'S
ALWAYS BEEN GOOD TO US.

24:54.324 --> 24:56.357
YEAH, I COULD DEFINITELY
USE THE CASH.

25:01.098 --> 25:02.431
NO, BUT FOR REAL, THOUGH,

25:02.433 --> 25:04.199
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

25:04.201 --> 25:07.069
MAN, I JUST WANT TO START
BOOKING BIGGER BANDS, YOU KNOW?

25:07.071 --> 25:08.337
I FEEL LIKE THE SCENE'S

25:08.339 --> 25:10.204
- REALLY PICKING UP.
- IT'S ALL POSSIBLE, MAN,

25:10.206 --> 25:11.205
YOU JUST GOT TO
GET THE BANDS

25:11.207 --> 25:12.808
TO MAKE THE STOP.

25:12.810 --> 25:14.145
YOU JUST LET ME WORRY
ABOUT THAT, ALL RIGHT?

25:17.148 --> 25:18.914
HEY, YOU MIND
LOCKING UP?

25:18.916 --> 25:21.015
YEAH, MAN,

25:21.017 --> 25:23.284

25:23.286 --> 25:25.119
NO, NO, I'M GOOD,
I'LL MEET UP WITH Y'ALL LATER.

25:25.121 --> 25:27.024
ALL RIGHT, MAN.

25:28.225 --> 25:29.390
HEY, I GOT A SURPRISE

25:29.392 --> 25:30.959
FOR Y'ALL TONIGHT, TOO.

25:30.961 --> 25:32.194
I THINK I MIGHT
KNOW WHAT IT IS.

25:32.196 --> 25:34.696
THINK IT'S READY?

25:34.698 --> 25:36.400
I THINK IT'S CLOSE.

27:56.439 --> 27:58.440
- WHOO-HOO!
- WHAT THE FUCK

27:58.442 --> 28:00.908
- IS UP WITH YOUR HAIR?
- GOT OURSELVES A PRETTY ONE, BOYS.

28:00.910 --> 28:03.377

42:04.721 --> 42:06.688
WE DIDN'T FUCKING

42:06.690 --> 42:08.922
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

42:08.924 --> 42:11.425
JUDGING BY THE LOOKS

DO YOU WISH TO DENY ANY OF
THESE TRUTHS, MISS HENDRICKS?

45:54.016 --> 45:57.183
OR DO YOU BELIEVE THAT
ENDING UP BEHIND BARS

45:57.185 --> 46:00.056
IS ALL A MATTER
OF CIRCUMSTANCE?

46:19.976 --> 46:21.509

48:45.188 --> 48:46.753

48:48.857 --> 48:50.424
AND JUST THINGS I LIKE
AND RANDOM THOUGHTS I HAVE.

48:50.426 --> 48:51.692
SO IT'S LIKE
A FUCKING DIARY.

48:51.694 --> 48:53.427
IT'S NOT A FUCKING DIARY!

48:53.429 --> 48:55.762
IT'S JUST FUCKING
LYRICS AND...

48:55.764 --> 48:57.331
RANDOM IDEAS AND...

48:57.333 --> 48:58.766

49:00.869 --> 49:02.469
YOU READ ME SOMETHING
WRITTEN BY YOU

49:02.471 --> 49:03.339
AND NOT ANOTHER BAND.

49:07.243 --> 49:09.543
IT'S EITHER THAT
OR YOU NEVER GET IT BACK.

49:09.545 --> 49:11.445
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
JUST GIVE IT HERE.

49:11.447 --> 49:12.549
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE.

49:14.516 --> 49:16.382
YOU HAVE TO SAY IT.

49:16.384 --> 49:18.319
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
LIKE PROMISES.

49:18.321 --> 49:19.487
SO?

49:22.458 --> 49:23.726
ALL RIGHT, I PROMISE.

49:29.866 --> 49:31.565
BUT, LIKE...

49:31.567 --> 49:34.701
YOU GOT TO REALIZE THAT...

49:34.703 --> 49:36.570
I HEAR THIS TO
REALLY LOUD MUSIC,

49:36.572 --> 49:39.572
AND LIKE...

49:39.574 --> 49:41.442
YOU KNOW WHAT?

49:41.444 --> 49:42.710
HERE, LET ME SEE THAT.

49:44.913 --> 49:46.346
JUST...

49:46.348 --> 49:48.349
IN MY HEAD,
IT'S MOSTLY SCREAMING.

49:48.351 --> 49:49.820
MM-HMM.

49:54.757 --> 49:56.590
ALL RIGHT, YOU READY?

49:56.592 --> 49:57.594
YEAH, GO AHEAD.

50:00.228 --> 50:01.362
"MY ENTIRE LIFE,

50:01.364 --> 50:03.630
PEOPLE TRY TO
RATTLE MY CAGE

50:03.632 --> 50:06.333
TO FORCE ME TO EXPLODE
FROM THE INSIDE OUT.

50:06.335 --> 50:07.534
TESTING ME.

50:07.536 --> 50:09.802
TRYING TO FIND
MY BREAKING POINT.

50:09.804 --> 50:12.940
MY MOTHER WOULD SAY,
'SON, STEP IN FROM THE COLD, '

50:12.942 --> 50:15.675
AND MY FATHER
JUST THE SAME.

50:15.677 --> 50:16.944
HE'D SAY,
'DON'T EVER LOSE

50:16.946 --> 50:19.480
YOUR SELF-CONTROL.'

50:19.482 --> 50:20.780
BUT I OPENED THE WINDOW.

50:20.782 --> 50:23.250
I LET THE COLD AIR FLOW.

50:23.252 --> 50:24.884
I LOST MY SELF-CONTROL."

50:30.226 --> 50:32.628
MM.

50:34.496 --> 50:36.429
CODY CATES LIVED AN HONEST LIFE.

50:52.480 --> 50:53.880
HIS FAMILY

50:53.882 --> 50:59.219

IN THE COMMUNITY.

50:59.221 --> 51:03.392
IS THIS WHAT
THEY DESERVE?

51:04.759 --> 51:07.761
THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR
ANY OF THIS TO HAPPEN.

51:07.763 --> 51:09.630

CHEER SEASON
DOESN'T END WITH FOOTBALL.

COUPLE OF DRINKS TO EASE YOUR NERVES?

I MEAN,
THEY WERE EVERYWHERE.

01:07:24.239 --> 01:07:25.505
THEY WERE...

01:07:25.507 --> 01:07:27.674
HAD WEAPONS,
HAD ALL KINDS OF BATS.

01:07:27.676 --> 01:07:29.576
I MEAN, WE WEREN'T
EXPECTING THAT.

01:07:29.578 --> 01:07:31.179
WE DIDN'T COME FOR THAT.

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:42.454
I FEEL LIKE...

01:07:42.456 --> 01:07:44.926
IT WAS ALL MY FAULT.

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:30.002
FUCKERS, COME ON!

01:08:30.004 --> 01:08:31.770
YOU KNOW, IT'S A FUCKING
PAIN IN THE ASS

01:08:31.772 --> 01:08:34.674
EVERY TWO WEEKS TO HAVE TO
BEAT ONE OF THESE FUCKERS DOWN.

01:08:34.676 --> 01:08:37.676
RIGHT? AM I FUCKING RIGHT?

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:53.359
THE STUFF I RECALL IS

01:08:53.361 --> 01:08:55.598
PRETTY HARD TO FORGET.

01:08:58.633 --> 01:09:00.332
AND AT THAT POINT,

01:09:00.334 --> 01:09:04.304
IT HAD BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I HAD ANYTHING TO DRINK.

01:09:04.305 --> 01:09:05.770
- BYE!
- BYE.

01:09:05.773 --> 01:09:07.743
IT'S GOOD SEEING YOU.
HAVE A GOOD ONE.

01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:14.613
YO, LET'S GET UP THERE.

01:09:14.615 --> 01:09:17.317
RICKY KEEPS
BLOWING ME UP.

01:09:47.682 --> 01:09:49.018
THESE FIGHTS
NEVER WOULD MATERIALIZE.

01:09:50.718 --> 01:09:52.551
ONE SIDE WOULD SHOW UP
AND EVERYONE WOULD

01:09:52.553 --> 01:09:53.885
GATHER IN THE PARKING LOT

01:09:53.886 --> 01:09:56.424
LIKE A BIG, FUN
SOCIAL EVENT.

01:09:57.792 --> 01:09:59.928
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.402
BUT NO ONE
WAS READY FOR THIS.

01:10:36.397 --> 01:10:38.866
I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING,
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.

01:10:43.437 --> 01:10:44.670
I WISH...

01:10:47.976 --> 01:10:49.777
IT WAS JUST TOO LATE.

01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:19.775
- BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
- WHOO-HOO!

01:11:26.114 --> 01:11:27.747
FUCKER, COME HERE!

01:11:27.749 --> 01:11:28.915

01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:30.151
COME HERE,
YOU FUCKERS!

01:11:45.667 --> 01:11:47.699
IT'S NOW OR NEVER,
MOTHERFUCKERS!

01:11:47.701 --> 01:11:49.003
WE END THIS SHIT TONIGHT.

01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:01.546
COME HERE. COME
HERE, MOTHERFUCKER

01:12:01.548 --> 01:12:02.850
COME ON.

01:12:22.536 --> 01:12:24.769
- YO, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
- YEAH, LET'S JUST GET OUT OF HERE.

01:12:24.771 --> 01:12:27.038
- FUCK!
- DAVIS, DAVIS, CAN WE PLEASE GET OUT OF HERE?

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:28.908
YO, JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP,
ALL RIGHT?

01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:31.077
- LET ME THINK!
- NO, FUCK THAT, WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

01:12:31.079 --> 01:12:32.577
WE'RE FUCKED UP! WAIT!

01:12:35.650 --> 01:12:39.217
I'M A NINJA IN MY CADDY.

01:12:39.219 --> 01:12:42.822
WAIT, CODY, STOP THIS!
STOP IT, WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE!

01:12:42.824 --> 01:12:45.123
SHUT UP, NO. PLEASE,
CAN WE JUST GET OUT OF HERE?

01:12:46.828 --> 01:12:48.627
- OH, MY GOD!
- OH!

01:12:48.629 --> 01:12:50.195
WHOO!

01:12:50.197 --> 01:12:51.697
OH, MY GOSH, WHAT...

01:12:51.699 --> 01:12:53.232
- FUCK!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:12:53.234 --> 01:12:55.234
STOP IT, MAN, LET ME OUT
OF THIS FUCKING CAR!

01:12:55.236 --> 01:12:56.668
- HOLY SHIT!
- ALL RIGHT!

01:12:56.670 --> 01:12:57.670
NO, WE'RE FUCKING GOING.

01:13:16.324 --> 01:13:18.658
GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE WAY.

01:13:20.794 --> 01:13:22.595
W-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:13:22.597 --> 01:13:24.130
GET ME THE FUCK
OUT OF THIS CAR.

01:13:40.882 --> 01:13:41.881
NO!

01:13:41.883 --> 01:13:43.114
W-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:13:43.116 --> 01:13:44.716
CODY, STOP THIS! STOP IT,

01:13:44.718 --> 01:13:46.051
- WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE!
- STOP!

01:13:46.053 --> 01:13:47.588
- OH, MY GOD!
- NO, NO, NO!

01:13:54.227 --> 01:13:55.728
NO, YOU MOTHERFUCKER!

01:13:55.730 --> 01:13:58.634
- FUCK!
- YEAH, I BET HE LIKED THAT ONE.

01:14:02.102 --> 01:14:03.170
YEAH!

01:14:10.978 --> 01:14:12.744
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

01:14:12.746 --> 01:14:14.947
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

01:14:14.949 --> 01:14:16.948
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT,
BRO, JUST STAY...

01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:18.350
STAY WITH ME.
CALL AN AMBULANCE!

01:14:18.352 --> 01:14:20.121
SOMEBODY CALL
THE FUCKING AMBULANCE!

01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:28.159
IS HE OKAY?

01:14:28.161 --> 01:14:29.961
HE'S DEAD,
HE'S FUCKING DEAD!

01:14:29.963 --> 01:14:31.363
NOT LIKE THIS.

01:14:31.365 --> 01:14:34.399
BRIAN, SIT UP,
COPS ARE COMING, MAN.

01:14:34.401 --> 01:14:37.269
DON'T YOU FUCKING DIE.

01:14:37.271 --> 01:14:39.738
DON'T YOU FUCKING
LEAVE ME, MAN!

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:40.739
NOT LIKE THIS.

01:14:42.276 --> 01:14:43.912
NOT LIKE THIS.

01:15:02.163 --> 01:15:03.764
NO!

01:15:21.782 --> 01:15:24.183
WHAT DID YOU DO?

01:15:24.185 --> 01:15:26.952
WHAT DID YOU JUST DO?
OH, MY GOD!

01:15:26.954 --> 01:15:28.086
OH.

01:15:28.088 --> 01:15:31.090
OH, MY GOD!

01:15:31.092 --> 01:15:32.992
LORD, HELP ME.

01:15:32.994 --> 01:15:34.460
HELP ME.

01:15:34.462 --> 01:15:37.395
OH, MY GOD.

01:15:37.397 --> 01:15:39.864
OH, MY GOD,
WHAT IF HE'S DEAD?

01:15:39.866 --> 01:15:40.866
WHAT IF HE'S DEAD?

01:15:40.868 --> 01:15:42.167
MICHELLE!

01:15:42.169 --> 01:15:43.368
WHY?

01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:45.070
WHAT IF YOU KILLED HIM?

01:15:45.072 --> 01:15:47.273
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

01:16:12.333 --> 01:16:13.669
NO!

01:16:33.855 --> 01:16:37.088
JUST... FUCKING
WAIT, DON'T LOOK AT HIM.

01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:38.459
DON'T FUCKING
LOOK AT HIM.

01:16:45.532 --> 01:16:49.068
Y'ALL DON'T HAVE TO
GO DOWN WITH ME, OKAY?

01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:50.869
I'LL, UH...

01:16:50.871 --> 01:16:52.505
I'LL TELL THEM THAT
Y'ALL WEREN'T IN THE CAR.

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:53.939
BUT WE WERE
IN THE CAR!

01:16:53.941 --> 01:16:55.207
MICHELLE, I DON'T THINK
YOU UNDERSTAND

01:16:55.209 --> 01:16:57.746
HOW SERIOUS THIS IS!

01:17:53.066 --> 01:17:54.835
FUCK!

01:17:59.373 --> 01:18:00.942
FUCK!

01:18:08.115 --> 01:18:09.785
FUCK!

01:18:10.584 --> 01:18:11.852
FUCK!

01:18:13.553 --> 01:18:15.421
FUCK!

01:18:15.423 --> 01:18:16.421
NO...

01:18:16.423 --> 01:18:18.591
NOT ME.

01:18:18.593 --> 01:18:20.462
OH, GOD, NO, PLEASE.

01:18:48.054 --> 01:18:50.456
MOM...

01:18:50.458 --> 01:18:53.658
MOM, YOU AND DAD
NEED TO COME UP HERE.

01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:57.328
WESTERN PLAZA.

01:18:57.330 --> 01:19:01.199
IT'S BRIAN,
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

01:19:01.201 --> 01:19:02.838
IT'S BAD, MA.

01:19:04.972 --> 01:19:06.971
I DON'T KNOW.

01:19:06.973 --> 01:19:08.607
PLEASE, JUST...

01:19:08.609 --> 01:19:09.977
JUST COME.

01:19:34.567 --> 01:19:35.701
I REMEMBER...

01:19:35.703 --> 01:19:39.604
IT BEING SO COLD.

01:19:39.606 --> 01:19:41.109
UNUSUALLY COLD.

01:19:48.382 --> 01:19:50.381
AND THERE WAS GLASS
AND METAL EVERYWHERE.

01:19:50.383 --> 01:19:52.051
IT WAS CHAOS.

01:19:52.053 --> 01:19:55.453
IT... IT WAS WORSE
THAN ANY NIGHTMARE.

01:20:07.634 --> 01:20:08.734
CODY'S THOUGHTS
THAT NIGHT

01:20:08.736 --> 01:20:12.738
LAY IN INTIMIDATION,

01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:14.042
IN FEAR.

01:20:16.509 --> 01:20:19.043
BUT NOT HATRED.

01:20:19.045 --> 01:20:21.449
YEAH, BUT WHAT HE DID
IS STILL WRONG.

01:20:27.989 --> 01:20:30.592
AND YOU CANNOT
DEFEND WHAT HE DID.

01:21:43.396 --> 01:21:45.232
CAN I HAVE THE KEYS, PLEASE?

01:22:21.768 --> 01:22:22.868
CHUCK.

01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:25.470
WHAT? WHAT DO YOU GOT?

01:22:25.472 --> 01:22:28.439
WE BELIEVE THAT THE
EVIDENCE WILL CONVINCE YOU,

01:22:28.441 --> 01:22:32.778
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT,
THAT THIS WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT,

01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:37.716
THAT THIS IS WAS
NOT JUSTIFIED, AND...

01:22:37.718 --> 01:22:41.452
AND THAT THE DEFENDANT
INTENTIONALLY...

01:22:41.454 --> 01:22:45.125
AND KNOWINGLY
MURDERED BRIAN DENEKE.

01:22:47.594 --> 01:22:50.328
HE HAD NEVER ATTEMPTED
TO APPLY HIS BRAKES

01:22:50.330 --> 01:22:52.331
OR TURN HIS STEERING WHEEL

01:22:52.333 --> 01:22:54.067
AS HIS CADILLAC HAD
APPROACHED BRIAN.

01:22:58.138 --> 01:23:00.404
HE HAD FLED THE SCENE
OF A CRIME

01:23:00.406 --> 01:23:02.110
AND HE LIED
TO THE POLICE.

01:23:03.744 --> 01:23:05.144
WHEN THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:06.511
HAD DESCRIBED
BRIAN'S INJURIES,

01:23:06.513 --> 01:23:10.149
HE CONCLUDED THAT BRIAN
HAD REMAINED CONSCIOUS

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:12.917
AS HIS BODY WAS DRAGGED UNDER
THE... UNDERNEATH THE WHEELS

01:23:12.919 --> 01:23:14.388
OF THAT CADILLAC.

01:23:16.389 --> 01:23:17.558
THE IMPACT...

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:22.760
IMPACT SO SEVERE,

01:23:22.762 --> 01:23:25.631
THAT HIS COLLARBONE HAD BEEN
TORN FREE FROM HIS SHOULDER.

01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:05.804
OUR YOUNG PEOPLE...
ON BOTH SIDES

01:24:05.806 --> 01:24:08.306
OF THE AISLE
IN THIS COMMUNITY

01:24:08.308 --> 01:24:09.640
NEED TO BE TOLD

01:24:09.642 --> 01:24:11.877
BY THE 12 OF YOU

01:24:11.879 --> 01:24:13.979
THAT WHAT YOU DO
CARRIES WITH IT

01:24:13.981 --> 01:24:15.250
CONSEQUENCE.

01:24:17.284 --> 01:24:18.620
NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE.

01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:22.891
NO MATTER
WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:26.227
AND NO MATTER
HOW YOU DRESS.

01:24:33.901 --> 01:24:35.533
I DON'T EXPECT

01:24:35.535 --> 01:24:37.938
YOU TO ENJOY SENDING
THIS YOUNG MAN TO PRISON.

01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:41.543
I DON'T.

01:24:43.977 --> 01:24:46.310
I EXPECT YOU TO DO IT
WITH A TEAR IN YOUR EYE

01:24:46.312 --> 01:24:47.315
AND YOUR HEART
IN YOUR THROAT.

01:24:52.453 --> 01:24:54.019
PRESIDENT JOHN KENNEDY
SAID,

01:24:54.021 --> 01:24:55.319
"WE DO THINGS,

01:24:55.321 --> 01:24:57.488
NOT BECAUSE
THEY ARE EASY,

01:24:57.490 --> 01:25:00.194
BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD."

01:25:01.527 --> 01:25:04.762
TODAY I ASK YOU
TO DO THE HARD THING.

01:25:04.764 --> 01:25:07.933
I ASK YOU TO SEND A MESSAGE
TO THIS COMMUNITY

01:25:07.935 --> 01:25:11.802
THAT ALL YOUNG PEOPLE,
ALL OF THEM,

01:25:11.804 --> 01:25:14.338
WILL SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES
OF THEIR ACTIONS,

01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:17.442
AND THAT YOU ARE HOLDING
CODY CATES

01:25:17.444 --> 01:25:21.749
UNCONDITIONALLY RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE DEATH OF BRIAN DENEKE.

01:26:28.915 --> 01:26:31.852
"DESTROY EVERYTHING."

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:37.088
IS THIS THE MESSAGE WE WANT
TO SEND OUR CHILDREN

01:26:37.090 --> 01:26:39.991
FOR GENERATIONS TO COME?

01:26:39.993 --> 01:26:44.829
"DESTROY... EVERYTHING."

01:26:44.831 --> 01:26:47.498
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS NOT A CASE

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:49.533
ABOUT DIVERSITY

01:26:49.535 --> 01:26:50.868
OR TOLERANCE,

01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:54.038
THIS IS NOT ABOUT

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:57.442
JUDGING PEOPLE FOR
THE WAY THEY DRESS.

01:26:57.444 --> 01:26:58.510
THIS CASE

01:26:58.512 --> 01:27:00.945
IS ABOUT A GANG
OF YOUNG MEN

01:27:00.947 --> 01:27:03.814
WHO CHOSE A LIFESTYLE

01:27:03.816 --> 01:27:07.051
DESIGNED TO INTIMIDATE
THOSE AROUND THEM,

01:27:07.053 --> 01:27:10.454
TO CHALLENGE AUTHORITY

01:27:10.456 --> 01:27:13.658
AND TO PROVOKE A REACTION
FROM SOCIETY

01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:15.396
ITSELF.

01:27:17.530 --> 01:27:19.463
WHEN THOSE PUNKS BROUGHT

01:27:19.465 --> 01:27:21.666
BATS AND CHAINS
OUT THERE WITH THEM

01:27:21.668 --> 01:27:23.568
TO WESTERN STREET
THAT NIGHT,

01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:26.104
A CONSPIRACY WAS PUT
INTO PLAY

01:27:26.106 --> 01:27:30.478
TO KILL AND MAIM THOSE
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.

01:27:33.146 --> 01:27:35.713
CODY HAD NO TIME
TO THINK

01:27:35.715 --> 01:27:37.114
OR PONDER,

01:27:37.116 --> 01:27:39.784
HE HAD TO TAKE
IMMEDIATE ACTION

01:27:39.786 --> 01:27:41.556
AND HE TOOK IT.

01:27:43.123 --> 01:27:44.622
AND IF HE HAD TO LIVE IT

01:27:44.624 --> 01:27:46.858
ALL OVER...

01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:47.862
HE WOULD DO IT AGAIN.

01:27:50.129 --> 01:27:51.863
YOU SEE,
WHAT CODY CATES FACED

01:27:51.865 --> 01:27:55.100
OUT THERE THAT NIGHT

01:27:55.102 --> 01:27:57.202
WAS A BAD COMBINATION:

01:27:57.204 --> 01:28:00.037
A MEAN DRUNK WITH A WEAPON.

01:28:00.039 --> 01:28:01.038
AND SOMEWHERE,

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.707
IN THE INFINITE PROCESSES

01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:06.711
THAT SHAPE A BOY
INTO A MAN...

01:28:06.713 --> 01:28:11.082
SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO BRIAN DENEKE.

01:28:11.084 --> 01:28:14.452
THE MANNER OF HIS DEATH
WAS, UNFORTUNATELY,

01:28:14.454 --> 01:28:16.954
THE END RESULT OF A LONG LIST

01:28:16.956 --> 01:28:21.995
OF POOR CHOICES OVER
THE LAST SIX YEARS OF HIS LIFE.

01:28:23.597 --> 01:28:25.863
YOU COULD EVEN ARGUE
THAT HE WAS DESTINED

01:28:25.865 --> 01:28:27.498
TO DIE THE WAY HE DID.

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:32.503
HE WAS A VIOLENT INDIVIDUAL.

01:28:32.505 --> 01:28:33.904
AND IT TOOK VIOLENCE

01:28:33.906 --> 01:28:37.175
ON CODY CATES' PART...

01:28:37.177 --> 01:28:39.978
TO PUT AN END
TO FURTHER VIOLENCE

01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:43.651
AND TO SAVE
AN INNOCENT LIFE.

01:28:50.857 --> 01:28:52.459
LET THIS BOY GO HOME.

01:28:54.527 --> 01:28:56.097
RESTORE HIM
TO HIS FAMILY.

01:28:59.031 --> 01:29:01.198
'CAUSE HE DID
THE RIGHT THING.

01:31:20.339 --> 01:31:23.241
THE ONE STORY THAT, UH...

01:31:23.243 --> 01:31:25.275
THAT REALLY STRUCK ME

01:31:25.277 --> 01:31:28.747
AND GOT ME THINKING ABOUT
THIS WAS, A FEW YEARS AGO,

01:31:28.749 --> 01:31:30.314
THERE WAS THIS
TEENAGE PUNK ROCKER KID

01:31:30.316 --> 01:31:33.385
WHO WAS RUN DOWN
BY A WHITE JOCK

01:31:33.387 --> 01:31:35.185
IN DAD'S CADILLAC.

01:31:35.187 --> 01:31:38.189
AND, UH...
THIS BOY DIED

01:31:38.191 --> 01:31:40.891
BECAUSE HE LOOKED DIFFERENT.

01:31:40.893 --> 01:31:43.795
SO THIS THING HAPPENS,
THIS GUY KILLS THIS KID,

01:31:43.797 --> 01:31:46.363
AND IS CLEARLY GUILTY,

01:31:46.365 --> 01:31:48.433
YOU KNOW,
HIS GUILT IS ADMITTED,

01:31:48.435 --> 01:31:51.403
AND GUESS WHERE THIS
ALL-AMERICAN ATHLETE IS,

01:31:51.405 --> 01:31:53.337
HE'S IN COLLEGE.

01:31:53.339 --> 01:31:57.042
YOU KNOW, THE JURY FELT
THE PUNK ROCKER DESERVED TO DIE

01:31:57.044 --> 01:31:59.010
BECAUSE HE LOOKED
THE WAY HE DID.

01:31:59.012 --> 01:32:02.212
AND NOT ONLY WAS HE KILLED,
BUT THEN, IN THE TRIAL,

01:32:02.214 --> 01:32:05.116
HE WAS KILLED AGAIN
BECAUSE THEY...

01:32:05.118 --> 01:32:06.984
YOU KNOW,
CRITICIZED HIS LIFESTYLE

01:32:06.986 --> 01:32:10.889
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T, YOU KNOW,
WEAR A TOMMY HILFIGER SHIRT

01:32:10.891 --> 01:32:13.224
AND KHAKI PANTS, YOU KNOW?

01:32:13.226 --> 01:32:17.127
AND THEN THE KILLER WAS EVEN
APPLAUDED AT GRADUATION

01:32:17.129 --> 01:32:18.796
BECAUSE HE WAS
A FOOTBALL STAR.

01:32:18.798 --> 01:32:19.797
THE AMERICAN DREAM,

01:32:19.799 --> 01:32:22.233
STRONG, NORMAL.

01:32:22.235 --> 01:32:24.402
HE NEVER A SPENT
A DAY IN PRISON.

01:32:24.404 --> 01:32:25.903
SO WHO DO WE BLAME?

01:32:25.905 --> 01:32:27.238
YOU KNOW?

01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:29.207
EVERYBODY WANTS TO SAY,
YOU KNOW,

01:32:29.209 --> 01:32:31.743
"TOO MUCH VIOLENCE,
TOO MUCH VIOLENCE TODAY,"

01:32:31.745 --> 01:32:33.110
YOU KNOW?

01:32:35.281 --> 01:32:36.848
DID EVERYONE FORGET
ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR,

01:32:36.850 --> 01:32:38.382
OR THE BIBLE,
OR SHAKESPEARE, YOU KNOW?

01:32:38.384 --> 01:32:41.452
VIOLENCE
ISN'T BRAND-NEW.

01:32:41.454 --> 01:32:43.220
THAT'S WHY I ASKED THE QUESTION,
YOU KNOW?

01:32:43.222 --> 01:32:45.756
I PUT THIS UP
ON MY WEBSITE.

01:32:45.758 --> 01:32:48.993
I SAID, "IS ADULT ENTERTAINMENT
KILLING OUR CHILDREN,

01:32:48.995 --> 01:32:52.130
OR IS KILLING OUR CHILDREN
ENTERTAINING ADULTS?"

01:32:52.132 --> 01:32:53.832
I THINK THAT'S KIND
OF THE QUESTION

01:32:53.834 --> 01:32:56.067
WE GOT TO ASK
OURSELVES TODAY.

01:32:56.069 --> 01:32:58.403
AND, YES, ASK YOURSELF
THAT EVERY TIME

01:32:58.405 --> 01:33:01.439
YOU WATCH THE HUNGRY CAMERAS
AT THE CRIME SCENE,

01:33:01.441 --> 01:33:05.243
OR AT THE FUNERAL,
OR AT THE PLANE CRASH.

01:33:05.245 --> 01:33:07.112
YOU KNOW, I'M IN A SQUARE RIGHT NOW.
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME,

01:33:07.114 --> 01:33:09.480
I'M LOOKING AT MYSELF
IN A MONITOR, YOU KNOW?

01:33:09.482 --> 01:33:12.082
WE SIT IN FRONT
OF THE TV

01:33:12.084 --> 01:33:14.219
AND WE ARE THE TV.

01:33:14.221 --> 01:33:16.887
WE'RE A COPY
STARING AT A COPY...

01:33:16.889 --> 01:33:18.890
AT A COPY
AND A COPY.

01:33:18.892 --> 01:33:20.492
EVENTUALLY IT'S A XEROX

01:33:20.494 --> 01:33:23.161
THAT'S SO DEGENERATED,

01:33:23.163 --> 01:33:26.197
WE DON'T KNOW
WHICH CAME FIRST.

01:33:26.199 --> 01:33:27.832
AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE.

01:33:27.834 --> 01:33:29.501
AND THAT'S WHAT
I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH.

01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:28.025
DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO,

01:34:28.027 --> 01:34:29.594
I'M A FUCKING ANARCHIST!
