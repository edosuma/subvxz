No Pop, I'm leaving.

What?! The Raccoons?!

00:10.510 --> 00:12.746
I should have known!

They'll never know
what hit them!

Bert Raccoon wakes up.

Didn't we make
an agreement last night?

You've got to be
more considerate,

02:13.533 --> 02:15.468

messes you make.

02:15.568 --> 02:17.203
Julie/Tommy: Yes, Dad.

back, don't you?

I know, I'd
rather be outside too,

02:48.334 --> 02:49.702

02:50.236 --> 02:52.205
You know,
if we weren't here,

02:52.305 --> 02:55.208
then we wouldn't be making
these messes all the time.

02:55.308 --> 02:57.877
And dad wouldn't be
getting angry with us.

02:58.478 --> 03:01.281
Maybe he'd
be happier without us.

03:01.381 --> 03:04.217
Maybe he would.
Maybe we should leave.

03:04.317 --> 03:07.420
Yeah, we can
get along on our own.

03:09.422 --> 03:12.625
Hey, you want to?

see this house again,

Yep, Pop!

Yes, Pop!

04:15.288 --> 04:16.456
Sandwiches!?

04:16.556 --> 04:20.159
Uh... Pop?
That was a personal call for me.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.630
What?! I've told you
a thousand times,

04:23.730 --> 04:26.165
no personal calls
on the business lines.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.802
But Pop,
we don't have any other lines.

04:30.303 --> 04:33.439
That's because there's
no profit in a personal call.

04:35.241 --> 04:37.377
Anyway, what's this about lunch,

04:37.477 --> 04:39.279
when they're bucks to be?

04:39.379 --> 04:41.848
Well, I, I thought
I'd take an hour off

04:41.948 --> 04:44.150
for a picnic with Sophia.

04:44.250 --> 04:45.652
An hour off??

04:45.752 --> 04:47.220
That's where it all starts.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.055
Then you'll want an
hour and a half off!

04:49.155 --> 04:50.523
Then you'll want a week off!

04:50.623 --> 04:53.326
Then three weeks paid
vacation and a dental plan!

04:53.426 --> 04:54.927
No, Pop!

04:55.028 --> 04:56.796
It's just a picnic.

04:56.896 --> 04:59.766
Oooh,
now it's a company picnic?

04:59.866 --> 05:03.036
Next, it'll be a company car,
and then a pension!

05:03.703 --> 05:06.272
Why don't you
just retire right now?!

05:10.710 --> 05:13.880

05:22.822 --> 05:24.891
Retire right now, huh?

05:24.991 --> 05:28.494
Well, maybe I will take
the rest of my life off!

I'm getting hungry.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.655
Let's stop and eat lunch.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.991
Yeah, good idea!

12:39.091 --> 12:41.060
You're going to love
what I packed for lunch.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.561
Woof-woof!

12:42.661 --> 12:43.796
Woof!

12:44.497 --> 12:46.532
Look! Ice cream.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.502
Oh, Tommy...

12:51.637 --> 12:53.672
Don't worry,
I've got some...

12:54.473 --> 12:56.075
...chocolate bars.

12:57.176 --> 12:58.811
Is that
all you packed?!

12:58.911 --> 13:00.312
Yeah.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.848
I'm so hungry.

13:03.315 --> 13:05.818
Maybe we should
pick some berries?

13:05.918 --> 13:08.254
But we don't know
which ones are safe to eat.

13:09.021 --> 13:10.289
Dad would know.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.101
Hi Sophia.
Sophia Tutu: Hi Melissa,

13:22.201 --> 13:23.335
is Cedric here?

13:23.435 --> 13:25.271
Sofia!!

13:25.371 --> 13:27.940
Cedric, I just
stopped by the mansion

13:28.040 --> 13:29.675
to meet you for our picnic,

13:29.775 --> 13:32.578
and the Pig said you'd run away.

13:32.678 --> 13:35.748
Yes. I'm on my own now.

13:35.848 --> 13:37.883
What
on earth happened?

13:38.651 --> 13:41.086
Oh, Pop doesn't
appreciate me.

13:41.187 --> 13:43.422
How did Pop look, by the way?

13:43.522 --> 13:46.292
Oh, terrible!
Really?

13:46.392 --> 13:50.095
Yes, the pigs have made
a mess out of everything.

13:50.196 --> 13:51.163
Really?

13:51.263 --> 13:54.133
Did he say anything about me?

13:54.233 --> 13:55.367
Well...

13:55.467 --> 13:57.703
He seemed to think
you'd be back in an hour.

13:58.370 --> 14:01.140
Hey Dad, well he's wrong!

set off for home,

16:36.128 --> 16:37.629
Ho-hoo! Yummy!

16:37.730 --> 16:41.533

Dad makes me chocolate pudding

brought my bags?
