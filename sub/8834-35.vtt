11:47.959 --> 11:49.875
Excuse us.

11:51.625 --> 11:53.583
Wildcat, where is Baloo?

11:54.041 --> 11:59.291
Wildcat? I am Dr. Gesundheit,
rocket scientist no matter what.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.834
Be calm. Be cool.

12:02.917 --> 12:06.083
OK, where is Baloo, Doctor?

12:06.166 --> 12:08.041
-Can't tell you.
-Why not?

12:08.125 --> 12:10.083
-Promised.
-What if I guess?

12:10.166 --> 12:13.500
-OK.
-He's at... Louie's!

12:15.125 --> 12:17.542
Not at Louie's.
Uh, give me a clue.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.208
Beach?

12:25.291 --> 12:26.667
River?

12:27.375 --> 12:29.458
Lake?
A lake!

12:29.542 --> 12:30.834
Which lake?

12:34.208 --> 12:39.333
Starts with an F. Lake Farrow,
Lake Forsyth, Lake Flaccid?

12:39.417 --> 12:44.041
-On the nosy! Yay!
-Yay!

12:44.125 --> 12:48.834
Lake Flaccid, huh? The colonel and I
are gonna pay Baloo a little visit.

12:48.917 --> 12:51.875
That worm's gonna squirm.

12:51.959 --> 12:56.000
Worms? Does that mean
we get to go fishing, too?

12:56.083 --> 12:56.917
[groans]

12:57.000 --> 12:59.417
Colonel, after consulting
with Dr. Gesundheit,

12:59.500 --> 13:01.834
I have important information
to pass on to you.

13:01.917 --> 13:03.375
Great.

13:03.458 --> 13:04.875
[click]

13:05.834 --> 13:07.333
[owl hooting]

13:08.166 --> 13:10.750
Hey, I caught something!

13:10.834 --> 13:13.291
Just catch it quietly.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.792
[Rebecca] <i>We want to do everything we can</i>
<i>to stop those awful Martians.</i>

13:19.875 --> 13:25.083
-OK, no more Mr. Nice Bear.
-Shh! Listen.

13:25.166 --> 13:28.125
[Rebecca]
<i>Wild... I mean, Dr. Gesundheit,</i>

13:28.208 --> 13:32.083
has triangulated
on the Martian's signals, right, Doctor?

13:32.166 --> 13:33.542
Uh, yeah.

13:33.625 --> 13:36.709
I strangulated...
I triambul...

13:36.792 --> 13:37.875
What she said.

13:37.959 --> 13:41.625
So, I can take you to
the Martian landing site, Lake Flaccid.

13:42.208 --> 13:43.792
She knows where we are?

13:43.875 --> 13:45.291
[Grogg]
<i>Your government thanks you, ma'am.</i>

13:45.375 --> 13:48.208
<i>But remember, tell no one</i>
<i>about the Martian invasion.</i>

13:48.291 --> 13:50.041
Martian invasion?

13:50.125 --> 13:54.208
-It'll be our little secret.
-Good soldier.

13:54.291 --> 13:57.875
Now, go wait in my Jeep.
I gotta make a call.

13:57.959 --> 14:00.291
Coming... Doctor?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.917
Oh, that's just dandy.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.041
That gal is determined
to ruin my vacation.

14:07.125 --> 14:08.959
What'd I do to her?

14:09.792 --> 14:11.709
Well, you lied a lot.

14:11.792 --> 14:13.583
Besides that.

14:17.375 --> 14:19.291
Oh, baby!

14:19.375 --> 14:22.083
[chuckles]
Gettin' me an idea.

14:24.959 --> 14:29.166
Hmm...
Fireworks, party supplies, guacamole.

14:29.250 --> 14:31.375
That's it!

14:31.458 --> 14:36.750
If the lady wants Martians... [chuckles]
the lady's gonna get Martians.

14:40.959 --> 14:43.458
[phone ringing]

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
[groans]

14:46.083 --> 14:47.291
Hello?

14:47.375 --> 14:50.083
General Tumult, sir.
Colonel Grogg reporting, sir.

14:50.166 --> 14:55.917
-Grogg, do you know what time it is?
-0200, sir, but I have vital information.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.125
[groans] Another invasion, Grogg?

14:59.208 --> 15:01.875
What planet are they from this time?
Mars?

15:01.959 --> 15:04.542
Oh, sir, how did you know?

15:05.500 --> 15:07.125
Call it a lucky guess!

15:07.208 --> 15:10.542
Sir, I need tanks,
I need planes, I need infantry!

15:10.625 --> 15:13.250
-I need proof!
-[Grogg] <i>But, general, sir--</i>

15:13.333 --> 15:16.041
You are not gonna make me
look stupid again, Grogg!

15:16.125 --> 15:17.208
<i>Got that?!</i>

15:17.291 --> 15:21.667
I'll get you proof, all right.
I'm gonna bag myself a Martian.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.208
[groans]

15:26.542 --> 15:29.834
[laughing] Those Martians are in
for the shock of their lives.

15:30.041 --> 15:33.083
You don't know the half of it.

15:33.166 --> 15:37.000
Colonel, suppose this
whole thing was a hoax.

15:37.083 --> 15:39.750
Then can I chew out who ever did it?

15:39.834 --> 15:42.917
-You bet your nose, lady.
-Good!

15:43.000 --> 15:44.375
And then I'd throw 'em in jail,

15:44.458 --> 15:46.583
along with anybody else
who was in on the plot.

15:46.667 --> 15:47.834
Jail?

15:47.917 --> 15:50.417
Faking an invasion is a serious crime.

15:50.500 --> 15:53.583
Anybody pulls that on the army,
they pay big!

15:53.667 --> 15:57.166
Think I better tell him
that I'm not a rocket scientist?

15:57.250 --> 16:02.959
And have us all wind up in the slammer?
You're a rocket scientist no matter what.

16:03.041 --> 16:06.917
I wish somebody would make up their mind.

16:13.208 --> 16:16.291
One space invasion coming up.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.166
We got company!

16:20.959 --> 16:23.500
I don't know.
It's quiet... too quiet.

16:23.583 --> 16:28.083
Um, colonel, suppose there were
no Martians. [laughing]

16:28.166 --> 16:30.959
You wouldn't be terribly disappointed,
would you?

16:31.041 --> 16:32.834
[whirring]

16:38.500 --> 16:40.417
I don't believe he's doing this.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.333
It's finally happened.

16:42.417 --> 16:46.250
Man's first contact with life
from another planet.

16:47.083 --> 16:50.208
It's wonderful.
It's beautiful.

16:50.291 --> 16:53.041
Let's fry the slime buckets!

16:53.125 --> 16:54.083
[Rebecca and Wildcat yelling]

16:54.166 --> 16:56.959
[laughs]
I bet that sent Becky packing.

16:57.041 --> 16:58.375
Oh, man!

16:59.875 --> 17:02.417
[Rebecca] Don't shoot!
It's all a mistake!

17:02.500 --> 17:05.333
Wake up and smell the war paint, lady!

17:05.416 --> 17:08.750
They want to dice up our livestock
and shanghai our women!

17:08.834 --> 17:10.666
I gotta find Baloo!

17:12.125 --> 17:13.750
[grunting]

17:13.834 --> 17:17.250
If Baloo lives through this,
I'm going to kill him.

17:17.333 --> 17:19.416
[clicking]

17:23.500 --> 17:25.541
Hey, where'd the lady go?

17:25.625 --> 17:28.125
Oh. Uh... ach! My lederhosen!

17:28.208 --> 17:32.959
All of a sudden,
Fraulein Rebecca just disappeared.

17:33.041 --> 17:36.583
Scheming Martian devils!
Come on!

17:37.250 --> 17:39.250
[owl hooting]

17:39.333 --> 17:40.625
[both grunting]

17:40.709 --> 17:41.834
-You!
-You!

17:41.917 --> 17:45.667
Come out and fight,
you drool-dripping dirt-bags!

17:45.750 --> 17:48.333
Now see what your lying got us into?

17:48.417 --> 17:50.959
You're the one who lied to G.I. Schmo.

17:51.041 --> 17:53.959
Yeah, but you lied to me first,
so I had to lie to you

17:54.041 --> 17:55.750
to teach you the truth about lying.

17:55.834 --> 18:01.333
-Hey, this lady has potential.
-You're both nuts.

18:01.417 --> 18:07.000
Look, I got a plan to get us outta here.
But I'll need your help.

18:07.083 --> 18:10.500
-Doing what?
-What else? Lying.

18:12.333 --> 18:13.875
[owl hooting]

18:18.000 --> 18:19.834
I hate it when that happens.

18:19.917 --> 18:22.083
[Rebecca screams]

18:22.166 --> 18:23.834
OK, what was that?

18:23.917 --> 18:25.750
[screaming]

18:28.959 --> 18:31.750
The Martians!
Run!

18:31.834 --> 18:33.709
Lady, wait!
My gun!

18:33.792 --> 18:36.125
[growling]

18:40.500 --> 18:41.792
A Martian!
[yells]

18:41.875 --> 18:43.959
Doc, talk to him!
Quick!

18:44.041 --> 18:47.250
Uh, hello.
Hi.

18:47.583 --> 18:49.959
Welcome to Earth.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.417
How was your trip?!

18:52.500 --> 18:55.166
[yelling]

18:55.250 --> 18:58.250
Wow, so you guys
were eaten by the Martians.

18:58.333 --> 19:01.792
No, there never were any...
Oh, I'll explain later.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.291
[growling]

19:05.834 --> 19:07.166
Oh, no!

19:07.250 --> 19:11.250
It's got a horrible
flesh-melting ooze gun.

19:11.333 --> 19:13.917
-Ooze gun?
-Ooze gun!

19:14.709 --> 19:18.583
Oh! Oh! Colonel, my foot's caught.
Run!

19:18.667 --> 19:21.917
Save yourself.
I'm doomed!

19:23.125 --> 19:24.834
[yells]

19:24.917 --> 19:27.083
[groaning]

19:27.917 --> 19:29.625
[coughing]

19:30.709 --> 19:36.333
-Boy, she dies as good as you do.
-Told you she had potential.

19:37.291 --> 19:41.000
You are next, Earth scum!

19:41.083 --> 19:44.125
No... no!

19:44.208 --> 19:51.208
-Bet he runs to Cape Suzette.
-But he'll be back with reinforcements.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.625
[sniffing]

19:52.709 --> 19:55.667
[groans]
I better clean off this guacamole.

19:55.750 --> 19:59.291
Aw, I kind of like you in green.

19:59.375 --> 20:02.166
[both laughing]

20:11.792 --> 20:15.166
This better not be another one
of your daydreams, Grogg.

20:15.250 --> 20:18.709
It was real!
The horror! The carnage! The--

20:18.792 --> 20:21.125
-Campers.
-Campers?

20:24.333 --> 20:26.417
Halt!

20:26.500 --> 20:28.166
These are the people
you were talking about?

20:28.250 --> 20:30.917
[stuttering]
But the Martians got them.

20:31.500 --> 20:32.959
[all] Martians?

20:33.041 --> 20:36.458
Yes! They sprayed you with their
flesh-melting ooze gun.

20:36.542 --> 20:39.291
[stuttering]
And they ate you alive!

20:39.375 --> 20:42.792
Is it later yet?
You guys want to explain how I--

20:42.875 --> 20:45.375
Uh-uh, Uncle Wildcat.

20:45.458 --> 20:50.375
Did you notice
any unusual activity last night?

20:50.458 --> 20:53.500
You notice anything, honey lips?

20:53.583 --> 20:55.709
Not a thing, butterball.

20:56.250 --> 20:58.959
-[gags]
-Sorry to have bothered you folks.

21:03.291 --> 21:04.333
Move out, men!

21:04.458 --> 21:07.709
Private Grogg's been
hallucinating again.

21:07.792 --> 21:09.583
Pr... Private?

21:09.667 --> 21:13.083
Oh, Uncle Bucky,
I was a private last time.

21:13.417 --> 21:16.000
You said I could be a lieutenant.

21:16.083 --> 21:19.125
I told you never call me that
in front of the men!

21:21.083 --> 21:23.625
We make a great team, hey, Becky?

21:23.709 --> 21:26.750
No, we don't.
That was the act of a desperate woman.

21:26.834 --> 21:29.709
Thanks to you,
I'm gonna hate myself tomorrow.

21:29.792 --> 21:33.417
-Well, how come?
-'Cause you made me lie!

21:33.500 --> 21:37.709
I know. I'm sorry,
but, man, you were great.

21:37.792 --> 21:40.709
[laughs]
I think you've earned a vacation.

21:40.792 --> 21:45.250
Well, I suppose
one day off wouldn't hurt.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.000
[music plays]

21:50.083 --> 21:55.333
[Baloo] Becky, there's hope for you yet,
and that's no lie.
