WEBVTT

00:01.131 --> 00:02.611
<i>All right, everybody.</i>

00:02.654 --> 00:04.395
<i>We should be arriving
at Langley International</i>

00:04.439 --> 00:06.006
in just a few hours.

00:06.049 --> 00:07.311
Thank you for booking your trip

00:07.355 --> 00:09.661
with ValueVacay
package vacations.

00:09.705 --> 00:11.359
<i>ValueVacay--</i>

00:11.402 --> 00:15.189
<i>we don't offer refunds,
but we do offer apologies.</i>

00:15.232 --> 00:17.495
<i>I'm sorry for the smell.</i>

00:18.844 --> 00:21.325
Did you have
a nice vacation, dear?

00:21.369 --> 00:25.547
No! My cheap ass husband booked
an all-inclusive trip

00:25.590 --> 00:29.638
with ValueVacay
to some Cancun shithole!

00:29.681 --> 00:31.509
The trip didn't have to be bad!

00:31.553 --> 00:33.337
It's these lousy kids
that ruined it!

00:33.381 --> 00:35.644
Like when Steve left the door
open and all those

00:35.687 --> 00:38.125
black spiny-tailed iguanas
came into the room.

00:38.168 --> 00:41.650
I was airing things out because
Hayley blew up the bathroom!

00:41.693 --> 00:42.825
I was sick!

00:42.868 --> 00:45.045
That monkey put its finger
in my mouth!

00:45.088 --> 00:47.003
You sucked on
that monkey's finger!

00:47.047 --> 00:49.310
Mom told me to do it!

00:49.353 --> 00:52.008
I thought it was one of
those marketing monkeys

00:52.052 --> 00:53.923
that promote new salsa flavors!

00:53.966 --> 00:56.839
Speaking of monkeys,
I don't wanna monkey around

00:56.882 --> 00:59.102
with those black clouds
in front of us.

00:59.146 --> 01:00.843
Then don't do it!

01:00.886 --> 01:04.847
It's too late, I'm sorry.

01:10.287 --> 01:11.723
Francine...

01:11.767 --> 01:13.334
About our argument before...

01:13.377 --> 01:16.685
I booked this extremely budgeted
vacation package.

01:16.728 --> 01:18.034
It's my fault.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.385
So I just want to say,
if we don't survive...

01:21.429 --> 01:24.345
you also made a lot of mistakes
before this trip,

01:24.388 --> 01:25.824
and I don't forget that.

01:25.868 --> 01:28.958
Are you gonna bring up
the little Matt Damon movie--

01:29.001 --> 01:30.525
<i>Downsizing.</i>

01:30.568 --> 01:32.744
You forgot to buy me a ticket,
so I had to sit by myself.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.398
You forgave me for that!

01:34.442 --> 01:35.617
I did forgive you.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.271
I'm just remembering it now.

01:37.314 --> 01:38.924
I watched from
across the theater

01:38.968 --> 01:40.883
while you and the kids
laughed your asses off!

01:40.926 --> 01:42.450
We weren't laughing!

01:42.493 --> 01:44.756
I don't think that movie
was supposed to be funny.

01:44.800 --> 01:45.975
It was hysterical.

01:46.018 --> 01:47.585
Matt Damon was so small!

01:47.629 --> 01:49.413
It was pretty thoughtless, Mom.

01:49.457 --> 01:52.068
Oh, you're calling
Mom thoughtless, Steve?

01:52.112 --> 01:54.940
You let my Sims family
die in a house fire!

01:54.984 --> 01:56.638
I was five!

01:56.681 --> 01:59.249
They said the saddest nonsense
as they burned.

01:59.293 --> 02:01.556
Let it go, Hayley.

02:01.599 --> 02:05.037
When you were five, you poked
a hole in my diaphragm,

02:05.081 --> 02:06.822
to disastrous result!

02:06.865 --> 02:09.172
Five?
Do you mean me?

02:09.216 --> 02:10.869
I'm a disastrous result?

02:10.913 --> 02:12.610
I like you now!

02:12.654 --> 02:17.006
Please, we're all very scared,
and you're fighting so loudly.

02:17.049 --> 02:18.529
Why don't you just die,
old lady!

02:20.357 --> 02:22.272
<i>The engines are out!</i>

02:22.316 --> 02:24.492
<i>- We're gonna be okay!</i>

02:24.535 --> 02:27.799
<i>
We're definitely going to die!</i>

02:27.843 --> 02:30.759
<i>Sweet, sweet lightning,
I knew you would save me!</i>

02:33.065 --> 02:35.372
I'm declaring this bird
a no-fly!

02:35.416 --> 02:37.157
Everyone head to the back!

02:38.245 --> 02:39.898
Francine, the week
we were married,

02:39.942 --> 02:41.639
you ate all the Golden Grahams.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.075
Excuse me?

02:43.119 --> 02:44.947
These are your parachutes!

02:44.990 --> 02:46.644
You open them like this.

02:46.688 --> 02:47.906
Oops!

02:47.950 --> 02:49.256
I'm sorr--

02:57.351 --> 03:00.223
Mom? Dad?

03:00.267 --> 03:02.051
Hayley!

03:10.407 --> 03:11.887
Steve!

03:13.976 --> 03:15.717
Oh, thank God we're all okay.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.589
There's a lighthouse there.
Let's see if someone's inside.

03:18.633 --> 03:23.377
I hope they speak Portuguese.
I'm two days in on Duolingo.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.468
<i>Holaaaa?</i>

03:27.511 --> 03:29.948
Which is "hello?"

03:31.036 --> 03:33.256
Seems like no one's been here
for a long time.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.823
Lots of drinking water,

03:34.866 --> 03:37.782
and about a thousand cans
of pumpkin pie mix.

03:37.826 --> 03:39.741
All those canned food drives

03:39.784 --> 03:42.744
where I gave delicious
pumpkin pie mix,

03:42.787 --> 03:44.136
was that all going to...

03:44.180 --> 03:46.138
lighthouse keepers?

03:46.182 --> 03:47.270
Gross.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.098
This radio doesn't work.

03:49.141 --> 03:51.840
Somebody's bound to
come look for us.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.581
Maybe once this fog clears.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.104
Could be a long wait.

03:55.147 --> 03:58.020
A chance to have some
quality time together!

03:58.063 --> 03:59.891
I can't say I liked
the plane crash,

03:59.935 --> 04:03.068
but at least it put a stop
to all that silly fighting.

04:03.112 --> 04:06.420
I, for one, am glad that we've
stopped all that silly fighting.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.509
I'll tell you what isn't silly--

04:08.552 --> 04:09.684
our love for each other.

04:09.727 --> 04:10.685
A hundred percent.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.513
The message is clear.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.123
And yet...

04:14.166 --> 04:17.518
I still remember the things
you all did that made me mad.

04:17.561 --> 04:19.041
I'm thinking about them
right now.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.261
I'm thinking only of
those things.

04:21.304 --> 04:23.741
Right, it's like,
I'm glad you're all alive,

04:23.785 --> 04:27.745
I just wish my Sims family
was alive too, you know?

04:27.789 --> 04:29.225
My Golden Grahams.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.402
I cannot be here
with you people!

04:32.446 --> 04:34.709
There's not a single
book or magazine

04:34.752 --> 04:38.539
or 4,300-piece limited edition
Lego London Tower bridge?

04:38.582 --> 04:41.324
We have to sit around
staring at each other?

04:41.368 --> 04:43.370
We don't have to look
at each other at all!

04:43.413 --> 04:46.764
There's a TV/VCR combo.

04:46.808 --> 04:47.939
And a tape!

04:47.983 --> 04:49.941
Yessss.
Wait, what's on it?

04:49.985 --> 04:52.335
Some episodes of <i>Murphy Brown.</i>

04:54.337 --> 04:57.384
<i>Oh, this
newsmagazine is run by idiots!</i>

05:00.648 --> 05:02.345
<i>Whoa, Gold Top Nuts?</i>

05:02.389 --> 05:04.129
<i>I want it to be a nice party.</i>

05:04.173 --> 05:05.827
<i>It is the big game.</i>

05:05.870 --> 05:07.655
- My brother is here!

05:07.698 --> 05:10.222
<i>But he roots
for the opposite team!</i>

05:10.266 --> 05:12.355
<i>- My team's gonna win!</i>

05:12.399 --> 05:14.226
<i>Hey, Mom, that's Tiffany.</i>

05:14.270 --> 05:15.793
<i>I invited her over
for the big game!</i>

05:15.837 --> 05:17.317
<i>Tiffany's here?</i>

05:19.188 --> 05:20.972
<i>Hi!
I brought my boyfriend.</i>

05:21.016 --> 05:22.539
<i>Man!</i>

05:22.583 --> 05:23.975
- Honey, your boss is here!

05:25.847 --> 05:27.239
<i>Sorry to interrupt
the big game,</i>

05:27.283 --> 05:29.764
<i>but I came to tell you
you're fired.</i>

05:29.807 --> 05:31.809
<i>Oh, and give me that Gold Top.</i>

05:33.811 --> 05:36.248
<i>I had a second can of Gold Top.</i>

05:38.120 --> 05:39.469
<i>Gold Top Nuts.</i>

05:39.513 --> 05:42.080
<i>Give yourself the best.</i>

05:42.124 --> 05:43.778
That's all that's on the tape?

05:43.821 --> 05:45.823
Aaand Murphy.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.347
Cue Murphy.

05:47.390 --> 05:48.435
Where Murphy Brown?

05:48.478 --> 05:50.654
Ughh, we gotta get
off this island.

05:50.698 --> 05:52.352
I'm gonna see
if I can fix the radio.

05:52.395 --> 05:53.962
That's a dumb idea.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.485
I'll just fix the big light.

05:55.529 --> 05:58.183
I'm gonna write an SOS message
on the beach with rocks.

05:58.227 --> 05:59.446
And I'll help.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.317
Ugh. Don't talk to me
while we do it.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.886
You don't talk to me first!

06:39.747 --> 06:43.054
- Hey.
- Yeah?

06:43.098 --> 06:44.447
Were you gonna say something?

06:44.491 --> 06:46.188
I, uh,

06:46.231 --> 06:48.408
I don't remember.

06:48.451 --> 06:50.410
Was I gonna say something?

07:23.443 --> 07:26.750
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

07:26.794 --> 07:28.796
Who are we?

07:28.839 --> 07:30.885
The only question, really...

07:30.928 --> 07:32.800
in addition to all the others.

07:33.627 --> 07:36.151
So none of us knows who we are.

07:36.194 --> 07:37.979
But we are.

07:38.022 --> 07:39.371
We exist.

07:39.415 --> 07:41.939
Agreed. Our existence
is unquestionable.

07:43.027 --> 07:47.031
Listen to the sound
of my existence upon the ground.

07:47.075 --> 07:49.947
And I know that
I am human, that we...

07:49.991 --> 07:51.427
are humans.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.474
But what does it mean
to be humans?

07:54.517 --> 07:56.867
I would like to posit something.

07:56.911 --> 07:59.174
There is a lighthouse
over there.

07:59.217 --> 08:02.525
If it contains other humans,
they might know who we are.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.527
Or why we are.

08:04.571 --> 08:05.702
Sure.

08:08.009 --> 08:10.054
No one is here.

08:10.098 --> 08:11.882
Someone was just here.

08:11.926 --> 08:14.581
They were eating
some sort of food.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.105
Mmm.

08:17.148 --> 08:21.805
This is the only, and therefore
best food I've ever had.

08:21.849 --> 08:24.155
They were building
some sort of device.

08:24.199 --> 08:25.548
- And look at this.
- Look at what?

08:25.592 --> 08:27.811
Seems like they go like this.

08:27.855 --> 08:29.334
They're making
everything blurry.

08:29.378 --> 08:31.075
That's how everything is to me.

08:31.119 --> 08:33.991
Then now, I am like you.

08:38.561 --> 08:40.563
Not much to see.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.260
Where did all the people go?

08:42.304 --> 08:44.045
Look at that!

08:44.088 --> 08:45.916
"H and E."

08:45.960 --> 08:47.744
Who is "he"?

08:47.788 --> 08:50.921
What if someone was interrupted
while writing "heaven"?

08:50.965 --> 08:53.533
- Ooh, I like that.
- Ahh.

08:53.576 --> 08:54.751
Or "hell."

08:54.795 --> 08:56.797
- Hmm.
- Uh-oh.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.450
Or "heggo"?

08:58.494 --> 08:59.626
What is "heggo"?

08:59.669 --> 09:01.366
A third option.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.282
Ugh!

09:04.326 --> 09:06.676
I don't understand what
any of this stuff is.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.505
But how are we going to get
answers to our questions?

09:09.549 --> 09:10.854
Who are we?

09:10.898 --> 09:12.769
Why are we here?

09:12.813 --> 09:15.206
What does it mean to be human?

09:15.250 --> 09:17.774
I hunger in my despair.

09:17.818 --> 09:20.603
Where is can?

09:20.647 --> 09:21.822
<i>...idiots!</i>

09:23.998 --> 09:26.130
<i>- Whoa, Gold Top Nuts?</i>
- People!

09:26.174 --> 09:27.567
<i>I want it to be
a nice party.</i>

09:27.610 --> 09:29.133
<i>- It is the big game.</i>

09:29.177 --> 09:30.874
<i>Honey, your boss is here.</i>

09:30.918 --> 09:32.267
<i>Sorry to interrupt
the big game,</i>

09:32.310 --> 09:34.617
<i>but I came to tell you
you're fired.</i>

09:34.661 --> 09:36.140
This is humanity.

09:36.184 --> 09:37.359
This is culture.

09:37.402 --> 09:38.795
<i>Gold Top Nuts.</i>

09:38.839 --> 09:40.492
<i>Give yourself the best.</i>

09:42.233 --> 09:43.626
Again.

09:43.670 --> 09:46.063
<i>Whoa, Gold Top Nuts?</i>

09:46.107 --> 09:47.848
<i>I want it to be
a nice party.</i>

09:47.891 --> 09:49.501
<i>- It is the big game.</i>

09:49.545 --> 09:50.590
<i>My brother is here!</i>

09:50.633 --> 09:51.982
<i>My team's gonna win!</i>

09:52.026 --> 09:53.680
<i>I had a second can
of Gold Top.</i>

09:53.723 --> 09:55.072
- My brother is here!

09:55.116 --> 09:57.248
<i>But he roots
for the opposite team!</i>

09:58.728 --> 09:59.860
<i>Tiffany's here?</i>

09:59.903 --> 10:01.122
<i>Hi!</i>

10:01.165 --> 10:02.645
<i>- I brought my boyfriend.
- Man!</i>

10:02.689 --> 10:05.561
Tiffany's boyfriend
is something bad.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.563
Gold Top is something good.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.173
- My brother is here!

10:09.217 --> 10:11.262
<i>But he roots
for the opposite team!</i>

10:11.306 --> 10:14.004
<i>
Give yourself the best.</i>

10:15.049 --> 10:17.051
They have covered their bodies.

10:22.578 --> 10:24.885
We look just as they now.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.714
<i>
Give yourself the best.</i>

10:27.757 --> 10:29.846
Gold Top Nuts.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.065
The best, correct?

10:31.108 --> 10:33.067
They are everything.
They are all.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.938
How can we carry on
without them?

10:35.896 --> 10:38.942
All we have is
the pumpkin pie mix, but...

10:44.513 --> 10:45.775
Gold Top!

10:45.819 --> 10:49.083
Gold Top! Gold Top!
Gold Top!

10:49.126 --> 10:52.042
- Gold Top! Gold Top!
- Look how human we're being!

10:52.086 --> 10:53.783
Tiffany is a name.

10:53.827 --> 10:55.219
And what a name!

10:55.263 --> 10:57.091
We need names.

10:57.134 --> 10:59.006
My name is Can.

10:59.049 --> 11:02.792
My name is Lighthouse.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.185
My name is Can.

11:04.228 --> 11:05.447
We're doing it!

11:05.490 --> 11:07.231
Gold Top! Gold Top--

11:07.275 --> 11:08.537
Stop!

11:08.580 --> 11:10.191
Is it Gold Top?

11:10.234 --> 11:12.062
Are these names for people?

11:12.106 --> 11:14.021
Let us turn to the tape!

11:14.064 --> 11:15.718
<i>It is the big game.</i>

11:15.762 --> 11:17.807
The one who puts out
the Gold Top first

11:17.851 --> 11:20.418
is always standing,
like I am now.

11:20.462 --> 11:21.985
They are called Mom.

11:22.029 --> 11:23.726
I take this name.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.860
The one who is fired,
Mom calls it "honey."

11:26.903 --> 11:28.644
I like this sound for myself.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.602
I still like Can.
Call me Can.

11:30.646 --> 11:32.300
- Call me... <i></i>

11:32.343 --> 11:35.042
Murphy Brown.

11:37.609 --> 11:39.699
<i>Hi!
I brought my boyfriend.</i>

11:39.742 --> 11:40.830
- Booo!
- Hisss!

11:40.874 --> 11:42.527
- Ugh.

11:42.571 --> 11:46.357
Your rude belch has entered the
room like Tiffany's boyfriend.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.229
<i>It is the big game.</i>

11:48.272 --> 11:50.318
Can, what is "the big game"?

11:50.361 --> 11:52.799
It came to me in a dream, Mom.

11:52.842 --> 11:54.844
Are you ready to see
the big game?

11:54.888 --> 11:56.106
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

12:01.938 --> 12:03.113
Ahh!

12:04.462 --> 12:06.900
Excellent big game, Can.

12:06.943 --> 12:10.338
You know what this fire
reminds me of?

12:10.381 --> 12:12.079
The fireplace that you see
in the background

12:12.122 --> 12:14.342
when the dreaded Tiffany's
boyfriend comes in the door?

12:14.385 --> 12:15.473
Yes!

12:15.517 --> 12:16.866
The light in the sky,

12:16.910 --> 12:18.999
that flashes like
the magnificent Gold Top seal,

12:19.042 --> 12:20.304
has gone.

12:20.348 --> 12:22.437
But the small lights...

12:22.480 --> 12:24.526
I think
they can only be one thing.

12:24.569 --> 12:26.484
Other lighthouses.

12:26.528 --> 12:29.531
What about the water
that is in every direction?

12:29.574 --> 12:31.794
How could we ever get up
to those lighthouses?

12:31.838 --> 12:34.666
Obviously, the world is
an inverted, wet bowl,

12:34.710 --> 12:36.364
dotted with lighthouses.

12:36.407 --> 12:37.931
The further out you go,

12:37.974 --> 12:40.498
the higher you climb up
the watery walls.

12:40.542 --> 12:43.937
To understand the universe
is to control it.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.504
I have written a new story.

12:46.548 --> 12:50.378
Once, there was a dark-haired
person whose name was Mom,

12:50.421 --> 12:52.336
and she wanted to make
a nice party,

12:52.380 --> 12:54.382
for it was the big game,
after all...

12:54.425 --> 12:56.776
Another
good one from Can.

12:59.387 --> 13:01.650
A beautiful Gold Top day.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.439
<i>- ...Top Nuts?
- I want it to be a nice...</i>

13:08.483 --> 13:10.528
- Look at this! <i>
- It is the big game.</i>

13:10.572 --> 13:11.834
- Look at this! <i></i>

13:11.878 --> 13:13.314
<i>My brother is here.</i>

13:13.357 --> 13:14.532
<i>But he roots
for the opposite team.</i>

13:16.970 --> 13:19.059
Also, look at this!

13:19.102 --> 13:22.192
The pain is a hundred
Tiffany's boyfriends!

13:23.280 --> 13:26.936
One thing's clear-- this rock
is a very important rock.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.938
Ooh, Gold Top's on!

13:28.982 --> 13:30.157
<i>Sorry to interrupt
the big game--</i>

13:31.811 --> 13:33.638
- No! No!
- What is happening?

13:36.772 --> 13:39.035
It is gone.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.689
This is a sign.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.778
- It is time to go.
- To where?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.867
To the other lighthouses.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.651
Murphy Brown is right.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.262
There must be other lighthouses,

13:48.305 --> 13:50.090
and they must contain
other people.

13:50.133 --> 13:53.180
And maybe they don't have
our knowledge of Gold Top.

13:53.223 --> 13:54.659
We must teach them.

13:54.703 --> 13:56.705
We must... rule them?

13:56.748 --> 13:57.837
Easy, Can.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.577
It likely won't come to that.

13:59.621 --> 14:00.840
It probably will, though.

14:03.016 --> 14:04.060
It's ready.

14:04.104 --> 14:07.585
To new, identical worlds!

14:07.629 --> 14:11.154
The waters ahead
may hold untold bosses

14:11.198 --> 14:13.722
who seek to put us into fire.

14:13.765 --> 14:15.593
But by Tiffany herself,

14:15.637 --> 14:21.251
we will have the second can,
and it will be a nice party!

14:21.295 --> 14:22.862
So long, lighthouse.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.428
You've been good to us.

14:24.472 --> 14:27.344
Now, we must ration cans,
for it will be a long journey--

14:27.388 --> 14:28.911
Another lighthouse!

14:28.955 --> 14:31.348
Told ya!

14:32.741 --> 14:34.612
We bring word of Gold Top!

14:34.656 --> 14:37.485
Kneel before Gold Top,
you heathens!

14:40.314 --> 14:42.925
Uh, welcome to the Beacon Diner,

14:42.969 --> 14:46.929
home of the best seafood
on the Langley waterfront.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.583
Stan Smith, rewards member.

14:48.626 --> 14:50.933
Need a no-reservation
table for...

14:50.977 --> 14:52.935
my family.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.806
Oh, my God.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.634
Oh. Right.

14:56.678 --> 14:58.898
Tiffany's boyfriend,
this is embarrassing.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.684
<i>It's the fourth hour
of</i> Morning Mimosa,

15:02.727 --> 15:04.991
<i>and Trish has fallen asleep
in her chair,</i>

15:05.034 --> 15:08.081
<i>so it's time
for</i> Liquid Lunch with Suze!

15:08.124 --> 15:11.780
They're the local Langley family
that everyone's talking about,

15:11.823 --> 15:13.956
surviving a harrowing
plane crash

15:14.000 --> 15:15.958
and ending up
on an abandoned island

15:16.002 --> 15:18.961
where magnetic bedrock
erased their minds.

15:19.005 --> 15:22.617
What they got up to then has had
the whole nation laughing.

15:22.660 --> 15:25.794
My guests today, for their first
television interview,

15:25.837 --> 15:30.190
the Smiths, or as they've come
to be known, the Nuts family.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.887
One of our conditions
in coming here

15:31.931 --> 15:33.628
was that you not use that name!

15:33.671 --> 15:35.456
You survived a plane crash!

15:35.499 --> 15:36.979
- Which is incredible.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.154
Thank you.

15:38.198 --> 15:39.721
All the other crash survivors

15:39.764 --> 15:41.462
swam the short distance
to shore.

15:41.505 --> 15:45.683
Now, why on Earth did you choose
to swim to Magnet Island,

15:45.727 --> 15:47.033
famously shut down for making

15:47.076 --> 15:49.296
all those lighthouse keepers
go insane?

15:49.339 --> 15:52.212
We-- We didn't know
the island was magnetic,

15:52.255 --> 15:54.301
and we couldn't see anything
with all the mist!

15:54.344 --> 15:56.651
Yes, yes, before the island's
magnetic properties

15:56.694 --> 15:58.000
were discovered,
it was called Misty Island.

15:58.044 --> 16:00.350
- Everyone knows that.
- They do?

16:00.394 --> 16:02.700
Let's skip to
the ridiculous things

16:02.744 --> 16:04.746
you came to believe
on the island.

16:04.789 --> 16:07.618
Well, we couldn't remember
what society was,

16:07.662 --> 16:11.013
or who we were,
so we tried to figure it out.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.320
By watching what?

16:13.363 --> 16:15.104
This is the best part.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.063
An old commercial
for Gold Top Nuts--

16:17.106 --> 16:20.675
An old commercial
for Gold Top Nuts!

16:23.504 --> 16:25.245
It's all we
had to go on.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.508
Let's watch the commercial now,
and then we'll get into

16:27.551 --> 16:30.728
the frankly hilarious things
you took from it.

16:30.772 --> 16:32.252
<i>Whoa, Gold Top Nuts?</i>

16:32.295 --> 16:34.689
This is great.
So funny.

16:34.732 --> 16:36.212
Let's go over your dumb slang,

16:36.256 --> 16:37.692
like the Tiffany's
boyfriend stuff,

16:37.735 --> 16:38.867
and then maybe
talk about thinking

16:38.910 --> 16:40.434
the sun is a Gold Top seal,

16:40.477 --> 16:41.870
and then maybe the kids
can demonstrate

16:41.913 --> 16:44.220
that cuckoo
"big game" you made up.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.787
Dad, I don't want to do that.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.397
<i>
Give yourself the best.</i>

16:47.441 --> 16:51.227
So you guys watched this
commercial and your response

16:51.271 --> 16:53.577
was to start
worshipping cashews?

16:53.621 --> 16:55.144
You're making fun of us!

16:55.188 --> 16:57.538
How about you wear your
daughter's headband as a diaper,

16:57.581 --> 16:59.844
and we'll feed you
some of these for the camera.

16:59.888 --> 17:01.498
Have you had these yet?

17:01.542 --> 17:03.326
None of that stuff matters
to us now!

17:03.370 --> 17:04.893
You're being such
a brother-in-law,

17:04.936 --> 17:06.547
like you're rooting
for the opposite team.

17:06.590 --> 17:09.071
- This interview is over!

17:11.421 --> 17:15.512
Up next, we have a marketing
monkey from Pace Picante,

17:15.556 --> 17:18.733
and <i>Tin Cup</i> star
Rene Russo is here

17:18.776 --> 17:22.693
to lick their
spicy, new salsa off his finger!

17:22.737 --> 17:25.522
That. Was. Horrible.

17:25.566 --> 17:28.264
We are famous for being weirdos!

17:30.440 --> 17:32.399
Hey, Nuts family.

17:36.446 --> 17:39.536
Hey, looney birds,
you like nuts so much,

17:39.580 --> 17:41.408
how 'bout you [bleep] on these!

17:41.451 --> 17:43.410
Do you even have nuts?

17:43.453 --> 17:44.802
How dare you!

17:47.501 --> 17:50.199
That's it.
No more TV appearances.

17:50.243 --> 17:51.896
It's time to get back
to our lives

17:51.940 --> 17:53.768
and put this nonsense
behind us.

17:53.811 --> 17:55.900
But I can't stop thinking
about it.

17:55.944 --> 17:58.120
Why did any of it,
the plane crash,

17:58.164 --> 18:01.558
the memory wipe, the commercial,
why did any of it happen?

18:01.602 --> 18:02.907
That's island talk.

18:02.951 --> 18:05.127
The word "why" is now forbidden.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.086
Why, you ask?
Ya don't!

18:07.129 --> 18:08.217
Stan's right.

18:08.261 --> 18:10.132
We have to move on
with our lives.

18:10.176 --> 18:12.134
Forget it ever happened.

18:12.178 --> 18:14.267
And no nodding uneasily!

18:55.177 --> 18:58.441
I know, I know.
I'm making it worse.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.591
So.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.332
None of us can stop
thinking about

19:19.375 --> 19:20.898
what happened on the island.

19:21.899 --> 19:26.208
Steve you asked why,
and I think I know now.

19:26.252 --> 19:29.255
Before the island,
we were fighting so much.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.213
We thought we couldn't
forgive each other

19:31.257 --> 19:33.476
because we couldn't forget.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.957
But it turns out, if you forget,

19:36.000 --> 19:38.873
then there can be
no act of forgiveness.

19:38.916 --> 19:42.268
The answer, as much as
we've tried to deny it,

19:42.311 --> 19:47.621
as embarrassing and strange
as it may be, was on that tape.

19:47.664 --> 19:52.234
If we can't fully forgive
and we can't fully forget,

19:52.278 --> 19:57.805
then all we can do is offer
each other more kindness.

19:57.848 --> 20:00.895
We have to offer each other...

20:00.938 --> 20:02.679
the best.

20:02.723 --> 20:05.900
How I used to treat all of you.

20:05.943 --> 20:08.163
How I will treat you
from now on.

20:08.207 --> 20:18.478
I'll put out
the good nuts for you.

20:22.786 --> 20:25.876
Gold Top, Gold Top...

20:25.920 --> 20:27.748
Gold Top, Gold--

20:27.791 --> 20:29.750
I'm up in my room,
thinking about ice cream,

20:29.793 --> 20:32.100
wanting ice cream,
and then I remember we have

20:32.143 --> 20:34.537
that four-year-old
Soy Delicious.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.104
Lotta frost on there.

20:36.147 --> 20:39.150
Hey, I'm glad you didn't die
on that island or whatever.

20:41.152 --> 20:42.241
Mmm.

20:43.459 --> 20:44.678
Wow.

20:44.721 --> 20:46.854
These are actually incredible.

20:46.897 --> 20:48.421
You should go buy
some right now.
