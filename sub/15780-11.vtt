WEBVTT

00:02.768 --> 00:04.998
I commend thy soul
to God the Father Almighty...

00:05.037 --> 00:06.834
and thy body to the ground...

00:06.872 --> 00:10.968
earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
and dust to dust...

00:11.010 --> 00:13.171
Damn it. We're late already.
Is my tie on straight?

00:13.212 --> 00:14.338
Yeah.

00:14.380 --> 00:15.847
You really can't miss with a clip-on.

00:15.881 --> 00:17.007
We never should have stopped.

00:17.049 --> 00:18.346
Why is it every time
I need to get somewhere...

00:18.384 --> 00:20.818
We get waylaid by
jackassery? Pants!

00:20.853 --> 00:22.684
But it was a good thing we did, Pop.

00:22.721 --> 00:24.348
The ant people needed our help.

00:24.390 --> 00:25.516
Help, schmelp.

00:25.557 --> 00:27.024
The big reward they promised us...

00:27.059 --> 00:28.993
was nothing but
an old, licked-up Jolly Rancher.

00:29.028 --> 00:32.020
But they did give us the key
to their enchanted underground city.

00:32.064 --> 00:35.363
And Brock made special
friends with their queen.

00:35.401 --> 00:37.198
You can't put a price on that.

00:37.236 --> 00:39.033
My point exactly.

00:39.071 --> 00:41.301
You trying paying the electric bill with...

00:43.075 --> 00:45.043
Who shall change our vile body...

00:45.077 --> 00:47.136
that it may be like unto
his glorious, eternal super-body...

00:47.179 --> 00:48.373
Holy!

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074

01:06.365 --> 01:07.855
Heh. Sorry.

01:10.035 --> 01:15.735
Um, Sorayama funeral?

01:15.774 --> 01:17.264
Oh, great.
Thanks a bunch.

01:17.309 --> 01:19.004
No harm done.
We didn't miss it.

02:10.027 --> 02:13.657
We are gathered to bid farewell
to our beloved Michael Sorayama...

02:13.699 --> 02:17.260
whom the Great Shepard,
in His ultimate, unknowable wisdom...

02:17.302 --> 02:19.167
has called back to His heavenly flock.

02:19.204 --> 02:21.001
Funerals are creepy.

02:21.039 --> 02:22.836
What's the big deal?
You see dead guys all the time.

02:22.875 --> 02:24.069
When?

02:24.109 --> 02:26.168
Dude, just last week
Brock killed two dervishes...

02:26.211 --> 02:28.577
with a pillowcase full of Cokes
right in our bedroom!

02:28.614 --> 02:29.911
He just knocked them out.

02:29.948 --> 02:32.678
Go sing yourself
another lullaby, baby Dean.

02:32.718 --> 02:34.777
The police took them away
in body bags.

02:34.820 --> 02:37.118
Sleeping bags!
Those were sleeping bags!

02:38.390 --> 02:40.358
Hey, Pop,
are we related to this guy?

02:40.392 --> 02:42.952
I mean, am I supposed
to be all sad and stuff?

02:42.995 --> 02:45.020
No, Hank. He's someone
your father knows from college.

02:45.063 --> 02:46.052
Wow.

02:46.098 --> 02:47.622
Is that back when you had hair?

02:47.666 --> 02:51.033
Yes, I had hair then, Dean.

02:51.069 --> 02:54.698
Some say... too much.

02:54.740 --> 02:56.037
No, I haven't cut it yet.

02:56.074 --> 02:57.371
I'm growing it out.

02:57.409 --> 02:59.707
The kids wear it long these days.
Where have you been?

03:01.079 --> 03:03.309
Let's just not fight about it, Rusty.

03:03.348 --> 03:06.146
We wouldn't be fighting
if you quit riding me about my 'do!

03:06.185 --> 03:07.482
And it's "T.S.", now.

03:07.519 --> 03:08.986
Nobody calls me Rusty anymore.

03:09.021 --> 03:10.818
You going to give me
a hard time about that now, too?

03:10.856 --> 03:14.815
Not so long as I can still call you "son."

03:14.860 --> 03:17.260
Whatever turns you on, man.

03:17.296 --> 03:18.820
Oh, um, H.E.L.P.eR. says hello.

03:18.864 --> 03:19.990
Shall I put him on?

03:20.032 --> 03:21.499
No! Look, Dad, I got to go.

03:23.168 --> 03:25.659
How does my father always
know when I'm in my room?

03:25.704 --> 03:28.434
Hey, do you think
I could talk to him, T.S?

03:28.473 --> 03:30.998
'Cause I'm thinking of switching
my major to robotics...

03:31.043 --> 03:32.510
and I'd love to pick his brain.

03:32.544 --> 03:34.671
Yeah, he doesn't really
know that much about robots.

03:34.713 --> 03:36.112
They're a fad anyway, Mike.

03:36.148 --> 03:39.174
You'd be better off majoring in Betamax
for all the good a robotics degree...

03:39.218 --> 03:40.685
is going to do you in a couple of years.

03:40.719 --> 03:43.984
I don't know,
"Blade Runner" was just so cool!

03:44.022 --> 03:45.182
What's this? Chem 1?

03:45.224 --> 03:47.021
Thought you did
A.P. for that in high school.

03:47.059 --> 03:48.185
Yeah.

03:48.227 --> 03:49.854
No, it's not...

03:49.895 --> 03:51.692
I'm just...

03:51.730 --> 03:53.493
I'm tutoring Leslie Cohen.

03:53.532 --> 03:55.659
Tutoring?
You're doing her homework.

03:55.701 --> 03:58.693
That's 'cause he's got
a tiny Chiney chubby for her.

03:58.737 --> 04:00.034
Hey, fellas.

04:00.072 --> 04:01.630
You were there, too, Mr. White?

04:01.673 --> 04:05.439
Oh, yeah. I was the DJ for the college
radio station and everything.

04:05.477 --> 04:07.138
What's a tiny Chiney chubby?

04:07.179 --> 04:10.478
So you and Pop and this dead guy
were all, like, roommates?

04:10.515 --> 04:13.313
No, no.
They just hung out in my room a lot.

04:13.352 --> 04:14.785
My roommate was...

04:14.820 --> 04:16.583
A freshman!
You believe that?

04:16.622 --> 04:20.149
That's all I need, some kid tagging along,
all wanting me to show him the ropes.

04:20.192 --> 04:23.593
It's going to totally harsh
the vibe of Casa de Venture.

04:23.629 --> 04:25.153
So is he a spaz or what?

04:25.197 --> 04:26.323
I don't know yet.

04:26.365 --> 04:27.559
He moved his stuff in
when I wasn't here.

04:27.599 --> 04:30.329
But dig... his name's Brock Samson.

04:30.369 --> 04:31.563
Can you imagine?

04:31.603 --> 04:33.161
Ten bucks says he's a fat kid.

04:33.205 --> 04:35.173
Wait, you lived with Brock?

04:35.207 --> 04:36.834
That is so unbelievably cool!

04:36.875 --> 04:39.207
No wonder you guys
are such super pals!

04:39.244 --> 04:42.839
Actually, back then
we didn't see much of each other.

04:43.815 --> 04:45.783
We had very different schedules...

04:45.817 --> 04:49.184
always coming and going
at different times.

04:57.396 --> 05:00.194
Tell them who really won
the roommate lottery that year.

05:00.232 --> 05:02.462
Oh, God.
Don't remind me.

05:02.501 --> 05:05.993
OK, so the university
sticks me with this exchange student.

05:06.038 --> 05:08.029
But check it out,
he's like a prince or something.

05:08.073 --> 05:11.304
His parents sent him a care package
last week for his birthday.

05:11.343 --> 05:12.469
You know what he got?

05:12.511 --> 05:13.808
A personal slave.

05:13.845 --> 05:16.040
The poor guy sleeps in my closet.

05:16.081 --> 05:17.309
Oh, speak of the dickweed.

05:17.349 --> 05:18.373
Hey, Verner.

05:18.417 --> 05:19.975
Baron Underbheit!

05:20.018 --> 05:21.485
Yeah. You told them?

05:21.520 --> 05:22.646
No!

05:22.688 --> 05:24.656
Baron Underbheit is right there!

05:24.690 --> 05:25.987
Holy crap!

05:26.024 --> 05:27.457
Brock, kick his butt!

05:27.492 --> 05:28.652
Relax, boys.

05:28.694 --> 05:30.491
He's not going to do anything.

05:30.529 --> 05:31.826
It's hallowed ground.

05:33.031 --> 05:34.498
So what was he like in the olden days?

05:34.533 --> 05:38.333
Well, except for the metal jaw,
pretty much the same...

05:38.370 --> 05:39.598
total dick.

05:39.638 --> 05:42.004
The tape was on the floor
for a reason, Peter.

05:42.040 --> 05:44.338
Your things belong
on your side of the room.

05:44.376 --> 05:46.003
And don't think I haven't noticed...

05:46.044 --> 05:48.171
that you moved it
to make your area larger.

05:48.213 --> 05:50.511
If you cannot obey the simplest of rules...

05:50.549 --> 05:52.676
Yeah, well, you don't make the rules, fella.

05:52.718 --> 05:54.845
You might be a big shot
in your own country...

05:54.886 --> 05:57.684
but around here you're just the kid
with the weirdest-smelling lunch.

05:59.024 --> 06:00.514
Very well.

06:00.559 --> 06:03.790
Then you leave me
with no choice but to...

06:03.829 --> 06:08.163
take this up with the R.A.
at the next floor meeting.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.134
Come, manservant.

06:11.837 --> 06:14.397
Who cuts his hair, the Incredible Hulk?

06:14.439 --> 06:16.634
What, did he walk into
the barbershop and say...

06:16.675 --> 06:19.143
"What can you do to make me
look more like Pete Rose?"

06:19.177 --> 06:21.304
Hey, what's wrong with his hair?

06:21.346 --> 06:22.973
I have, like, the same haircut.

06:23.015 --> 06:24.482
Yeah, but you're Chinese.

06:24.516 --> 06:26.143
You people can't be blamed
for what your hair does.

06:26.184 --> 06:28.311
I'm Japanese, jerk-off...

06:28.353 --> 06:30.150
But, yeah, that's so true.

06:30.188 --> 06:32.179
At least I don't have his eyebrows.

06:32.224 --> 06:35.489
You want to see eyebrows,
come to my creative writing class.

06:35.527 --> 06:38.428
There's this kid, no joke,
they're out to here.

06:38.463 --> 06:40.488
And the weirdness doesn't stop there.

06:40.532 --> 06:43.000
All he writes are these
way-too-specific poems...

06:43.035 --> 06:45.003
about monarch butterflies.

06:45.037 --> 06:46.834
Total closet-case!

06:46.872 --> 06:48.669
OK, this is just getting nuts.

06:48.707 --> 06:53.269
You are not going to tell me
you went to college with the Monarch, too.

06:53.311 --> 06:55.779
Where did you guys go,
super crazy, no way school?

06:55.814 --> 06:57.839
It was Michael's last wish...

06:57.883 --> 07:00.010
that he be escorted
to his eternal resting place...

07:00.052 --> 07:02.418
by those who were closest to him in life.

07:02.454 --> 07:09.292
T.S. Venture, Peter White,
Verner Underbheit, Brock Samson...

07:09.327 --> 07:11.124
if you would, please.

07:14.499 --> 07:16.023
Nope.

07:35.887 --> 07:37.684
Was that supposed to happen?

07:39.024 --> 07:41.117
Nope.
Sorry, wasn't me.

07:41.159 --> 07:44.322
I've got something planned
for next week, I think.

07:44.362 --> 07:45.420
But no.

07:45.464 --> 07:47.159
So much for that theory.

07:47.199 --> 07:48.666
Dean, what are you doing?

07:48.700 --> 07:50.167
I know you miss Dad already...

07:50.202 --> 07:52.568
but this is no time to go through
the old photo album.

07:52.604 --> 07:55.334
We need to get busy
and come up with a rescue plan.

07:55.373 --> 07:57.341
I'm thinking we bust out the hover bikes...

07:57.375 --> 07:59.969
Ioad them up with, like, hand grenades
and plasma cannons...

08:00.011 --> 08:01.171
No, Hank, l...

08:01.213 --> 08:03.113
Hear me out, Dean-o.
You're a smart kid and all...

08:03.148 --> 08:04.877
but you're not a wartime consigliore.

08:04.916 --> 08:08.784
Hank, we're not grown up enough
to rescue Dad and Brock by ourselves.

08:08.820 --> 08:10.117
We need help.

08:10.155 --> 08:12.555
What about the ant people?
They owe us one.

08:12.591 --> 08:14.616
I've got a better idea.

08:21.666 --> 08:23.133
Hello?

08:23.168 --> 08:25.295
Cool. Told you he's still alive.

08:25.337 --> 08:28.795
Sir, you don't know me,
but I'm Jonas Venture's grandson.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.307
Our dad's been kidnapped.

08:30.342 --> 08:31.969
We think a ghost might have done it.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.135
Say no more, lads.

08:33.178 --> 08:35.145
Team Venture is on the case.

08:35.179 --> 08:37.740
Just you sit tight,
and I'll summon the others.

08:37.782 --> 08:42.481
Kiki, lay out my traveling suit
and fetch my walking stick.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.010
A quest is afoot.

08:50.195 --> 08:54.723
Kano, you stalwart old man-mountain,
we're needed once again.

08:54.766 --> 08:56.700
Master Rusty's in trouble!

09:04.142 --> 09:05.769
Salutations.

09:05.810 --> 09:09.439
Do you have a moment
to talk about the Lord?

09:09.481 --> 09:11.449
That's OK, kids.

09:11.483 --> 09:13.974
More room in the Kingdom for us.

09:17.322 --> 09:18.619
Oh, Rodney, no.

09:18.657 --> 09:19.954
You're too old.

09:19.991 --> 09:21.288
You're going to get hurt.

09:21.326 --> 09:24.124
Aw, for corn's sake, Jeanie,
I got to do this.

09:24.162 --> 09:25.288
I took an oath.

09:25.330 --> 09:26.627
Now where are the pads?

09:26.665 --> 09:27.791
What pads?

09:27.832 --> 09:29.459
The maxi pads gathering
dust under the sink.

09:29.501 --> 09:31.469
What the hell pads do you think?

09:31.503 --> 09:33.596
My action man uniform knee pads.

09:33.638 --> 09:35.299
Oh, those.

09:35.340 --> 09:37.501
The ones that go on your uniform?

09:37.542 --> 09:38.804
And now she gets it.

09:38.843 --> 09:40.401
What does it look like I'm doing here?

10:10.508 --> 10:11.839
You did this.

10:11.876 --> 10:13.605
You did this, didn't you?

10:15.614 --> 10:19.516
As usual, your detective
skills are impeccable, Samson.

10:19.551 --> 10:22.679
You've succeeded
in exposing my sinister plan...

10:22.721 --> 10:26.919
to lock myself in a dungeon
chained to an albino.

10:31.563 --> 10:33.360
Great. Way to bodyguard.

10:33.398 --> 10:36.026
Got any more super theories
about who did this to us?

10:36.067 --> 10:37.864
Oh, hey, guys.

10:37.902 --> 10:39.494
It's really you!

10:39.537 --> 10:41.767
I'm so glad you all made it.

10:41.806 --> 10:44.036
Son of a gun, you really surprised me.

10:44.075 --> 10:47.044
I didn't think you'd all show up
for my funeral.

10:47.078 --> 10:50.172
And now I get to return the favor.

10:56.087 --> 10:57.554
Good day to you.

10:57.589 --> 11:01.821
Colonel Horace Gentleman,
R.A.F., M.I. 5, et cetera...

11:01.860 --> 11:02.952
retired.

11:02.994 --> 11:04.655
We spoke on the watch.

11:04.696 --> 11:08.792
And may I introduce my counterparts
from the original Team Venture?

11:08.833 --> 11:11.666
Kano, master of the martial arts.

11:11.703 --> 11:12.829
How do you do?

11:12.871 --> 11:14.338
Careful, lad.

11:14.372 --> 11:16.636
Those hands of his are strong enough
to crush a boulder...

11:16.675 --> 11:20.304
yet delicate enough to crush a butterfly.

11:20.345 --> 11:23.803
Otto Aquarius, exiled son of Atlantis.

11:23.848 --> 11:26.180
Salutations.

11:26.217 --> 11:28.845
And finally, the Action Man.

11:28.887 --> 11:30.115
How you doing?

11:31.322 --> 11:33.187
So enough with the formalities.

11:33.224 --> 11:35.215
What say we get down to it?

11:35.260 --> 11:36.693
Eat up, guys.

11:36.728 --> 11:38.525
This is your last meal.

11:38.563 --> 11:42.363
I had it brought in special
from the State University dining hall.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.368
Mike, it's nice to see
you're not dead and all...

11:44.402 --> 11:45.699
but are you going to tell us...

11:45.737 --> 11:47.034
why you've got us
chained up in a dungeon?

11:47.072 --> 11:48.767
Yeah, pally, what the hell?

11:48.807 --> 11:50.035
Enjoy.

11:50.075 --> 11:51.269
Thank you, ladies.

11:51.309 --> 11:52.708
You're welcome, Mike.

11:52.744 --> 11:53.972
We love you, Mike.

11:54.012 --> 11:56.378
Aren't my robots beautiful?

11:56.414 --> 11:58.245
Notice anything familiar about them?

11:58.283 --> 12:00.478
Yeah, I had that issue
of "Heavy Metal," too.

12:00.518 --> 12:02.713
Now quit screwing around, Mike.
What's this about?

12:02.754 --> 12:05.484
They're what this is about, Rusty.

12:05.523 --> 12:07.991
Look closely at their faces.

12:08.026 --> 12:09.755
Leslie Cohen?

12:09.794 --> 12:12.422
Don't they look just like her?

12:12.464 --> 12:14.989
You made Leslie Cohen robots.

12:15.033 --> 12:16.660
Jeez.

12:16.701 --> 12:18.692
Yeah, I think I did a pretty good job.

12:18.737 --> 12:21.501
Sure, but why would you do that, fella?

12:21.539 --> 12:23.507
To have sex with, Pete.

12:23.541 --> 12:25.168
I think that's obvious.

12:25.210 --> 12:27.201
The man was obsessed
with her in college.

12:27.245 --> 12:30.339
So? He was obsessed with Coco
from "Fame" the year before.

12:30.381 --> 12:31.871
Leslie's different!

12:31.916 --> 12:33.543
I loved her!

12:33.585 --> 12:36.019
Then why don't you just let us all go,
pick up the phone...

12:36.054 --> 12:37.954
and call her up like someone
who's not a total freak?

12:37.989 --> 12:40.184
Because of the restraining order...

12:40.225 --> 12:43.661
and because I need to make you all pay
for what you did to me.

12:43.695 --> 12:44.889
What did we do to you?

12:44.929 --> 12:47.022
Funny you should ask, Verner.

12:47.065 --> 12:49.625
I have a list, and you're first.

12:49.667 --> 12:54.627
Ah, there she is,
the queen of the skies in her day.

12:54.672 --> 12:56.367
A gleaming metal beauty.

12:56.407 --> 12:58.375
What memories she conjures.

12:59.744 --> 13:02.144
So, tell us who we're up against, boys.

13:02.180 --> 13:03.511
Who took your father?

13:03.548 --> 13:06.676
Was it the Velvet Phantom?
The Invisible Fist?

13:06.718 --> 13:09.346
The Mesmerist?
Troublemakers Incorporated?

13:09.387 --> 13:11.150
Look, we don't know who did it.

13:11.189 --> 13:13.851
And we don't care,
we just want to find Pop and Brock.

13:13.892 --> 13:15.655
Ah, that part's gravy pie.

13:15.693 --> 13:17.661
Your granddad implanted
a homing device...

13:17.695 --> 13:20.061
in one of your father's molars
when he was just a kid.

13:20.098 --> 13:23.499
Yes, little Rusty had a penchant
for getting himself kidnapped...

13:23.535 --> 13:25.503
about once a fortnight.

13:25.537 --> 13:27.664
Why, I remember one time...

13:27.705 --> 13:30.902
I believe it was during
the case of the Metal Mandingo...

13:32.043 --> 13:33.340
What's that sound?

13:33.378 --> 13:35.403
Gas! We're being attacked.

13:35.446 --> 13:39.177
Simba? Honey?

13:39.217 --> 13:40.479
- Action!
- Attack!

13:40.518 --> 13:41.849
Holy crap!

13:41.886 --> 13:43.376
No, don't!

13:52.096 --> 13:53.188
No, no!

13:53.231 --> 13:54.892
Everybody calm down!

13:54.933 --> 13:56.525
He's just our neighbor.

13:56.568 --> 13:59.366
Sure, I know what you're thinking,
he looks like a Dracula.

13:59.404 --> 14:00.996
But honest injun, he's OK.

14:01.039 --> 14:02.631
I was.

14:02.674 --> 14:05.472
Wow, Dr. O., I didn't know you could
turn into snakes.

14:05.510 --> 14:06.841
I can't.

14:06.878 --> 14:09.312
I'm merely adept
at clouding the minds of men...

14:09.347 --> 14:13.010
and obfuscating that
which their eyes perceive.

14:13.051 --> 14:16.646
Really, I was right here the whole time.

14:18.189 --> 14:20.054
Then these ain't snakes, either.

14:20.091 --> 14:22.321
Put 'em up.

14:25.029 --> 14:26.496
Two years, seventeen days.

14:26.531 --> 14:28.328
- What?
- From a stroke.

14:28.366 --> 14:29.856
Good day!

14:33.204 --> 14:34.671
You like it?

14:34.706 --> 14:36.674
Pure Underlandian sesame.

14:36.708 --> 14:39.006
Ah, you're right, Underbheit.

14:39.043 --> 14:41.341
This is some good stuff.

14:41.379 --> 14:43.347
Hey, that rhymes...

14:43.381 --> 14:46.077
Right, Underbheit.

14:48.419 --> 14:49.511
Psyche!

14:49.554 --> 14:51.112
It's oregano!

14:51.155 --> 14:53.851
You've been smoking a lie, you tiny fool.

14:55.393 --> 14:57.190
Come on, Mike, you're not high.

14:57.228 --> 14:58.354
Give it up.

14:59.764 --> 15:01.288
Mike?

15:01.332 --> 15:04.392
Allergic... oregano.

15:04.435 --> 15:06.300
It wasn't funny.

15:06.337 --> 15:08.134
I could have died, Verner.

15:08.172 --> 15:11.300
More importantly,
I had to cancel my study date with Leslie.

15:11.342 --> 15:12.468
That's it!

15:12.510 --> 15:15.172
I will tolerate no more of this madness.

15:23.388 --> 15:26.016
Anyone else like to test my Leslie bots?

15:26.057 --> 15:27.524
Good.

15:27.558 --> 15:29.185
On to you, Pete.

15:32.630 --> 15:34.996
Weird seeing someone else
drive the X-1.

15:35.033 --> 15:36.364
Relax, lads.

15:36.401 --> 15:40.599
Despite his racial handicap,
Kano here is a crackerjack pilot.

15:40.638 --> 15:42.503
Why, he can land her on a puffin...

15:42.540 --> 15:44.167
or a smurf.

15:44.208 --> 15:47.006
Hey, how come you're not all old and stuff
like the other guys?

15:47.045 --> 15:48.672
I am.

15:48.713 --> 15:51.511
I just age slower
because I'm half-Atlantean.

15:51.549 --> 15:53.676
Wow. How do I get to be one of those?

15:53.718 --> 15:56.414
A drunken sailor has to have his way
with your mer-mom, kid.

15:56.454 --> 15:59.946
You know, if you're interested
in a longer life...

15:59.991 --> 16:02.585
I have some good news to share with you.

16:02.627 --> 16:04.492
- Really?
- Great!

16:04.529 --> 16:06.554
Uh, thanks.

16:06.597 --> 16:07.859
We're coming up on it.

16:07.899 --> 16:09.992
Kano, bring her down.

16:11.669 --> 16:12.795
Hey, what the fu...

16:12.837 --> 16:14.236
Watch your language, kid.

16:14.272 --> 16:16.297
- Where is he?
- Ow. Where is who?

16:16.341 --> 16:17.968
Hey, what are you guys doing?

16:23.281 --> 16:25.476
All right, punk, what did you do with him?

16:25.516 --> 16:26.813
Who do you work for?

16:26.851 --> 16:28.648
Leave the boy be, Rodney.

16:28.686 --> 16:31.154
That molar has obviously
been here for ages.

16:31.189 --> 16:32.713
No, Kano.

16:32.757 --> 16:35.988
I don't think time machines
figure into this caper.

16:36.027 --> 16:40.828
This is, after all, the same university
young Rusty attended twenty years ago.

16:40.865 --> 16:42.162
Oh, yeah.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.168
Jonas made us move his stuff in here.

16:44.202 --> 16:47.501
Young Rusty most probably
removed his own tooth...

16:47.538 --> 16:50.837
in a somewhat misguided fit
of youthful rebellion.

16:50.875 --> 16:54.174
Boys, is there anything you forgot to tell us
about the kidnapping?

16:54.212 --> 16:56.510
Anything at all that might be helpful?

16:56.547 --> 16:57.844
It's like we said.

16:57.882 --> 17:00.612
We went to the funeral for
my dad's college friend...

17:00.651 --> 17:02.949
Mike Sura... soma... sonar...

17:02.987 --> 17:04.113
Sorayama?

17:04.155 --> 17:06.123
Professor Sorayama?

17:06.156 --> 17:07.784
He didn't die, did he?

17:07.825 --> 17:10.453
Because if he did, why am I busting my ass
on this term paper?

17:12.163 --> 17:13.460
Dude, you beefed.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.468
You're listening to the White Room.

17:17.502 --> 17:20.471
I'm your host, the ever popular Pete White.

17:20.505 --> 17:23.633
This next one's a dedication
to Leslie Cohen...

17:23.674 --> 17:26.074
from her little buddy Mike Sorayama.

17:26.109 --> 17:28.476
And he writes, "Leslie...

17:28.512 --> 17:31.482
"I masturbate furiously
to your picture every night.

17:31.516 --> 17:32.813
"Please notice me.

17:32.850 --> 17:34.374
"Love, Mike."

17:34.419 --> 17:36.148
Hey, I got kicked off the air for that.

17:36.187 --> 17:37.211
Isn't that enough?

17:38.356 --> 17:39.823
Not by a long shot, Pete.

17:39.857 --> 17:42.052
Go ahead and laugh
while you can, Rusty.

17:42.093 --> 17:43.788
You're next on my list.

17:43.828 --> 17:47.491
Out of everyone,
you betrayed me the most.

17:47.532 --> 17:49.762
The old fake coffin trick.

17:49.801 --> 17:52.326
Gadzooks, you think I would have
remembered that one...

17:52.370 --> 17:54.429
from the Mystery of the Old Fake Coffin.

17:56.207 --> 17:58.004
Salutations.

17:58.042 --> 18:00.374
Do you have a moment
to talk about the Lord?

18:01.412 --> 18:03.437
Now! Action!

18:06.984 --> 18:08.713
Good work, Otto.

18:09.987 --> 18:11.978
Go, Team Venture!

18:14.025 --> 18:15.458
Wow.

18:15.493 --> 18:17.552
Huh? Now that's how it's done.

18:17.595 --> 18:20.223
OK, gentlemen, here's the plan.

18:21.432 --> 18:27.996
OK, my barbarian
swings his +3 battle axe.

18:28.039 --> 18:29.301
No.

18:29.340 --> 18:31.399
The Leslie golem's skin is like rock.

18:31.442 --> 18:33.910
What the hell's a Leslie golem?

18:33.945 --> 18:37.142
A very powerful creature
that looks just like Leslie Cohen.

18:37.181 --> 18:39.149
Oh, for Pete... for my sake.

18:39.183 --> 18:40.810
Looks like Leslie Cohen, huh?

18:40.852 --> 18:42.820
Well, then my wizard seduces her.

18:42.854 --> 18:43.980
What? You can't do that.

18:44.021 --> 18:45.318
Sure I can.

18:45.356 --> 18:47.324
I have, like, twenty-five charisma points.

18:47.358 --> 18:48.552
I want to seduce her.

18:48.593 --> 18:51.118
No, don't! It's Leslie.

18:54.599 --> 18:55.657
Oh, come on!

18:55.700 --> 18:58.669
You're going to kill me
because I had fake sex on graph paper...

18:58.703 --> 19:00.603
with a girl who barely spoke
to you in real life?

19:00.638 --> 19:02.606
Don't act so innocent, Rusty.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.835
How do you explain
what happened the next morning?

19:10.481 --> 19:12.881
- Oh, hey, Mike.
- Leslie?

19:12.917 --> 19:14.441
Shh. He's sleeping.

19:14.485 --> 19:15.975
I did no such thing!

19:16.020 --> 19:18.454
I didn't lose my virginity
till I was twenty-four.

19:18.489 --> 19:19.820
It must have been Brock.

19:24.996 --> 19:27.590
Leslie bots, assemble!

19:27.632 --> 19:30.658
Destroy Brock Samson!

19:30.701 --> 19:35.297
Oh, this is going to be
a fitting punishment for that big bully.

19:35.339 --> 19:37.637
You all must secretly
be thanking me for this.

19:37.675 --> 19:40.803
You were there,
you know what he did...

19:40.845 --> 19:42.813
the night of our last D&D game.

19:42.847 --> 19:44.439
Of course, none of us knew at the time...

19:44.482 --> 19:47.007
he'd been thrown off
the football team that very day...

19:47.051 --> 19:48.951
for accidentally killing
Tommy the quarterback...

19:48.986 --> 19:52.649
or that he'd get super drunk
on his way back to the dorm.

19:52.690 --> 19:54.487
What are you looking at?

19:54.525 --> 19:56.618
But that still doesn't justify what he did.

19:58.829 --> 20:00.854
Who the hell... are you?

20:00.898 --> 20:04.664
I think that's your roommate, Rust.

20:13.878 --> 20:15.209
Have at you, sir!

20:15.246 --> 20:18.374
Hey, what are you...
no, no!

20:18.416 --> 20:19.508
Hey!

20:19.550 --> 20:21.074
No! Please, l...

20:21.118 --> 20:22.676
Somebody stop him!

20:25.356 --> 20:26.550
Hey!

20:34.398 --> 20:36.525
Finally!

20:36.567 --> 20:37.795
I got to see this.

20:41.272 --> 20:43.297
You broke our friends, Brock.

20:43.341 --> 20:46.208
They were helping us rescue you guys.

20:46.244 --> 20:47.802
Oh, sorry.

20:47.845 --> 20:49.870
Medical assistance...

20:49.914 --> 20:52.781
Bloody hurt.

20:52.817 --> 20:55.377
Leslie, Leslie...

21:00.691 --> 21:02.818
So it all comes together.

21:02.860 --> 21:06.489
He's not just a ghost, he's a ghost robot!

21:06.530 --> 21:07.861
That explains everything.

21:07.898 --> 21:10.833
No, Hank.
I think he's just a robot.

21:10.868 --> 21:13.666
Which means the real
Mike Soranamana...

21:13.704 --> 21:16.172
is probably hiding somewhere.

21:16.207 --> 21:18.835
And I think I know where!

21:23.881 --> 21:25.348
So he really did die.

21:25.383 --> 21:28.352
So, what, he programmed his robots
to hate us, too?

21:28.386 --> 21:29.853
I guess.

21:29.887 --> 21:33.186
Well, that makes about as much sense
as anything else today.

21:33.224 --> 21:38.355
So, what do you say we get out of here
before he starts to stink, huh?

21:38.396 --> 21:41.263
Uh... Rust?

22:09.193 --> 22:10.319
Sorry, man.

22:10.361 --> 22:11.658
I don't know what came over me.

22:11.696 --> 22:15.496
Anyway, they cut my scholarship,
so I'm out of here.

22:15.533 --> 22:17.330
Going to join the army.

22:17.368 --> 22:22.829
Oh, yeah, someone
from Venture Industries called...

22:22.873 --> 22:24.841
while you were at the infirmary.

22:24.875 --> 22:26.342
Your dad died.

22:26.377 --> 22:27.810
Later.

22:27.845 --> 22:30.905
That's good soup!
