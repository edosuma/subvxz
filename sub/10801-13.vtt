WEBVTT

00:02.330 --> 00:05.913
Captain's log, stardate 45470.1.

00:06.042 --> 00:08.497
The Enterprise
is in the Moab Sector

00:08.628 --> 00:12.839
to track a stellar core fragment
of a disintegrated neutron star.

00:12.965 --> 00:17.177
Our science teams have been asked
to monitor any planetary disruption.

00:17.970 --> 00:19.429
We've got a problem.

00:19.555 --> 00:22.591
Our core fragment will pass Moab IV
in six days.

00:22.725 --> 00:24.764
Isn't that what we anticipated?

00:25.019 --> 00:27.474
We didn't anticipate
someone living there.

00:27.605 --> 00:30.724
An artificial environment
on the southern continent, sir.

00:30.983 --> 00:33.652
You've established
that there's someone inside?

00:33.777 --> 00:36.612
Yes.
Sensors are reading human life forms.

00:36.739 --> 00:39.064
- Human?
- Are they responding?

00:39.741 --> 00:40.856
Negative.

00:40.993 --> 00:44.408
Any starships reported missing
in this sector, Mr Data?

00:44.913 --> 00:45.992
No, sir.

00:46.123 --> 00:49.242
How did they find themselves
on a deserted planet?

00:49.376 --> 00:52.709
- They must know we're here.
- Mr La Forge?

00:52.838 --> 00:55.542
Our sensors are picking up
EM readings.

00:55.674 --> 00:57.832
Wave patterns
from an old subspace relay.

00:57.968 --> 01:01.550
Which would suggest
they can communicate with us.

01:01.679 --> 01:05.095
Mr Worf, open frequencies
commonly used in the last century.

01:07.602 --> 01:08.977
Channel open.

01:09.979 --> 01:13.313
This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard

01:13.441 --> 01:16.193
of the Federation Starship
Enterprise.

01:16.944 --> 01:19.400
It is urgent that you respond.

01:20.740 --> 01:24.488
Sir, the shield around the structure
is increasing strength.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.944
Not exactly a welcome mat.

01:27.079 --> 01:29.653
We mean you no harm.

01:29.790 --> 01:33.289
We must warn you that your planet
is about to experience

01:33.419 --> 01:35.458
massive seismic disruptions

01:35.796 --> 01:38.369
due to an approaching
stellar core fragment.

01:39.133 --> 01:42.336
No structure
will be able to withstand them.

01:45.222 --> 01:48.970
- They are responding.
- On screen.

01:49.101 --> 01:52.220
Enterprise, I am Aaron Conor.

01:52.354 --> 01:57.265
Mr Conor, we were unaware
of human colonies in this system.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.310
I don't want to be rude,

01:59.444 --> 02:02.017
but we don't wish
to interact with outsiders.

02:02.155 --> 02:04.563
l'm only responding to your warning.

02:05.408 --> 02:09.655
The fragment will have effects
on your planet in six days.

02:09.787 --> 02:12.195
Yes, I know.
We have been tracking it.

02:12.332 --> 02:16.910
Our biosphere can withstand quakes
of 8. 7 on the Richter scale.

02:17.378 --> 02:18.576
Mr Data?

02:18.713 --> 02:23.838
The fragment has a density
of 100 billion kg per cubic cm.

02:23.968 --> 02:26.506
As a result,
when it passes Moab IV,

02:26.637 --> 02:31.429
it will cause tectonic shifts well
beyond 8.7 on the Richter scale.

02:31.559 --> 02:33.385
We have to evacuate you.

02:33.978 --> 02:38.106
Evacuate? That is not possible.
There must be an alternative.

02:38.482 --> 02:41.732
We will gladly
explore the possibility with you.

02:41.860 --> 02:43.900
Would you like to come aboard?

02:44.029 --> 02:47.813
Our environment is sealed.
No one can get in or out.

02:48.700 --> 02:51.867
We are capable
of matter-energy transport.

02:51.995 --> 02:53.454
Matter-energy?

02:53.580 --> 02:56.153
We can take you
through the structure.

02:57.042 --> 03:00.327
Really? That's quite remarkable.

03:00.629 --> 03:02.455
May we arrange your transport?

03:03.465 --> 03:08.423
No, I must remain here.
But under the circumstances,

03:08.553 --> 03:12.598
I will permit a small delegation
inside the biosphere.

03:13.141 --> 03:17.518
If only to see
your matter-energy transportation.

03:17.645 --> 03:22.390
Very good. Cmdr Riker and team
will be with you shortly.

03:27.572 --> 03:31.652
- This is a mistake.
- What would you have me do?

03:31.784 --> 03:33.693
Anything to keep them out.

03:33.828 --> 03:37.742
- We have nothing to hide.
- We have much to lose.

03:39.041 --> 03:42.576
- What is that?
- It's them. Look at this, Martin.

03:45.673 --> 03:47.001
Incredible.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:20.498 --> 04:23.534
Space, the final frontier.

04:25.044 --> 04:28.413
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

04:29.257 --> 04:33.124
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds...

04:34.595 --> 04:37.845
...to seek out new life
and new civilisations...

04:39.058 --> 04:42.641
...to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

05:40.660 --> 05:46.199
It's lovely. I can understand
why you're reluctant to leave.

05:46.332 --> 05:49.950
Not just reluctant, Miss Troi.
It is imperative that we remain.

05:50.085 --> 05:52.125
It would be suicide to evacuate.

05:52.254 --> 05:55.670
It would destroy what
we have worked for for two centuries.

05:55.799 --> 05:58.373
You see,
this is an engineered society.

05:58.510 --> 06:00.633
- Engineered?
- Genetically.

06:00.762 --> 06:04.427
Our ancestors from Earth
came to create a perfect society.

06:04.558 --> 06:07.594
They believed
through controlled procreation,

06:07.728 --> 06:10.100
they could
create people without flaws,

06:10.230 --> 06:12.686
and those people
would build a paradise.

06:12.816 --> 06:15.437
All of you have been
selectively bred?

06:15.569 --> 06:19.187
- Your DNA patterns chosen?
- Eight generations of us.

06:19.322 --> 06:23.402
We have immeasurably extended
the potential of humanity,

06:23.535 --> 06:25.574
physically, psychologically.

06:26.287 --> 06:28.446
We have evolved beyond...

06:29.332 --> 06:31.905
- Beyond...
- Beyond us?

06:32.627 --> 06:34.418
Frankly, yes.

06:35.213 --> 06:38.664
No one in this society
would be blind.

06:38.799 --> 06:42.465
- No offence intended.
- I can see you, sir.

06:44.263 --> 06:47.466
- Yes. Well, my point...
- Thank you, Martin.

06:47.600 --> 06:51.597
Perhaps you've made it clear
there are still a few imperfections.

06:53.647 --> 06:56.601
For the most part,
we are fully integrated,

06:56.734 --> 06:59.900
not just among ourselves
but with our environment.

07:00.279 --> 07:04.775
We don't just live here.
We are a part of our environment.

07:04.908 --> 07:10.993
Every plant, microscopic life form
is part of the master design.

07:11.498 --> 07:16.290
We cannot separate ourselves from it
without altering who we are.

07:16.419 --> 07:21.461
Your presence has already begun
to affect the balance of our society.

07:21.925 --> 07:23.834
If we don't survive,

07:23.968 --> 07:28.381
the balance of our society
won't mean a great deal, will it?

07:33.895 --> 07:35.437
I apologise.

07:35.563 --> 07:38.932
But he is performing his function
as designed to.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.561
What function is that?

07:40.693 --> 07:45.022
He is the interpreter
of our founders' intentions.

07:45.156 --> 07:47.481
- A judge?
- More or less.

07:47.617 --> 07:50.072
Obviously,
he has no diplomatic talents.

07:50.202 --> 07:51.946
And obviously you do.

07:55.749 --> 07:58.667
I've been bred
to fill this specific role.

07:58.794 --> 08:04.500
We grow up knowing exactly
what our society needs from us.

08:04.633 --> 08:07.800
- That takes the fun out of it.
- No.

08:07.928 --> 08:11.178
My psychology
tells me that I was born to lead.

08:11.306 --> 08:15.849
I am what I would choose to be.
Think of it another way.

08:15.977 --> 08:19.845
Are there still people in
your society who have not discovered

08:19.981 --> 08:21.725
what to do in life?

08:21.858 --> 08:26.070
They may be in the wrong job
or writing bad poetry.

08:26.196 --> 08:31.652
Or worse, they may be great poets,
working as labourers.

08:32.494 --> 08:34.818
That does not happen here.

08:34.953 --> 08:37.741
It is for us an ideal existence.

08:37.874 --> 08:40.412
We will not give it up easily.

08:41.210 --> 08:45.042
We will do whatever we can
to help you preserve it.

09:00.604 --> 09:02.680
Hannah, meet our guests.

09:02.815 --> 09:07.311
Yes, from the starship.
I've been looking forward to this.

09:07.444 --> 09:09.069
Hannah Bates, a scientist.

09:09.530 --> 09:12.234
If there's a way,
Hannah will find it.

09:12.366 --> 09:15.236
She has a remarkable talent
with theoretical physics.

09:15.744 --> 09:18.069
I've worked up a few schematics

09:18.205 --> 09:21.823
based on gravimetric potentials
and deflector energy-allocation.

09:21.958 --> 09:27.166
Geordi, Troi and I will return
to the Enterprise. Contact us.

09:27.297 --> 09:31.425
If Mr Conor doesn't mind,
I'd like to see more.

09:31.551 --> 09:35.216
No, no. That would be fine.
I'd like you to see it.

09:35.972 --> 09:38.677
Riker to Enterprise.
One to beam up.

09:38.808 --> 09:42.640
- Acknowledged, Commander.
- Energise.

09:49.652 --> 09:54.148
Are you sure my being here
is not going to be disruptive?

09:54.282 --> 09:58.493
Disruptive?
You mean what Martin was saying?

09:58.619 --> 10:02.202
I certainly wouldn't wish
to throw off your entire balance.

10:02.331 --> 10:04.904
Too late. The damage is done.

10:05.042 --> 10:06.501
Seriously.

10:06.627 --> 10:11.087
Strict interpreters like Martin
can forget we're still human.

10:11.215 --> 10:13.338
We'll adjust, accommodate.

10:13.926 --> 10:18.137
There must be other unexpected
events you have to deal with.

10:18.263 --> 10:20.837
An untimely death, an accident.

10:22.017 --> 10:26.513
Our geneticists screen out
congenital risks before conception.

10:27.439 --> 10:31.483
Our population is diverse enough
to maintain a genetic balance

10:31.610 --> 10:34.065
in the event of accidental death.

10:34.195 --> 10:37.399
Very little
that is unexpected occurs here.

10:38.074 --> 10:41.823
- Am I making this sound dull?
- Not at all.

10:41.953 --> 10:45.536
I'll tell you the truth,
but don't tell Martin.

10:45.665 --> 10:47.657
I've found today exhilarating.

10:48.376 --> 10:53.453
Meeting you, meeting new people,
with new ideas.

10:54.173 --> 10:56.664
I feel the same about being here.

10:57.927 --> 11:00.500
I'm a student of human nature.

11:00.638 --> 11:04.766
- I find this all fascinating.
- A student of human nature?

11:05.267 --> 11:07.307
I'm the ship's counsellor.

11:07.436 --> 11:10.105
I'm afraid you wouldn't find
much work here.

11:11.315 --> 11:15.182
I'd book a vacation
at your hotel if you had one.

11:15.319 --> 11:19.103
In that case,
I shall have them build one.

11:21.658 --> 11:27.531
The biosphere won't hold up. The
environment would be compromised.

11:27.664 --> 11:29.621
That's how I see it.

11:33.378 --> 11:34.956
Your ship.

11:36.840 --> 11:39.710
What kind of output
is it capable of?

11:39.843 --> 11:43.840
We have a powerful matter/antimatter
warp reaction system.

11:43.972 --> 11:47.423
Normally, it kicks plasma
up into the terawatt range. Why?

11:47.559 --> 11:51.307
Either we're going to have to move
or that fragment is.

11:52.814 --> 11:55.387
We can move a small moon

11:55.525 --> 11:59.474
but a stellar core fragment
is much too massive for us.

12:10.498 --> 12:14.080
- What's that?
- A wild idea, purely theoretical.

12:18.964 --> 12:21.206
A multiphase tractor beam?

12:21.341 --> 12:24.924
When we spotted the fragment,
I came up with the idea.

12:25.053 --> 12:28.257
But we can't generate
that kind of energy.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.597
You can.

12:37.732 --> 12:40.223
- We'd need Hannah on board.
- No.

12:40.360 --> 12:44.108
With their equipment,
we might alter the fragment's path.

12:44.239 --> 12:47.524
It's our only chance
to avoid evacuation.

12:47.659 --> 12:52.736
No one had ever come here and
no one had ever left until today.

12:52.872 --> 12:55.707
This is a date to note
in our history books.

12:55.833 --> 12:59.202
This is in violation
of the intentions of our founders.

12:59.337 --> 13:02.291
I don't think
they intended us to die.

13:02.423 --> 13:04.831
Her absence will create an imbalance.

13:04.967 --> 13:08.716
Temporarily. Circumstances
require us to be flexible.

13:08.846 --> 13:12.594
We have no idea how molecular
transport will affect her DNA.

13:13.142 --> 13:18.053
It won't affect her DNA at all.
There's a century of evidence.

13:21.358 --> 13:22.983
You can go, Hannah.

13:29.116 --> 13:32.948
- May I return later?
- I look forward to it.

13:36.540 --> 13:39.113
Enterprise, three to beam up.

13:40.877 --> 13:42.158
Energise.

13:53.681 --> 13:55.176
Captain's log, supplemental.

13:55.308 --> 13:57.977
La Forge and Bates
have spent three days

13:58.102 --> 14:01.222
trying to adjust the path
of the fragment.

14:01.356 --> 14:05.816
If they do not succeed
in 48 hours, we must evacuate.

14:05.943 --> 14:10.570
I believe some will choose to risk
death rather than leave, Captain.

14:10.698 --> 14:15.656
You've spent time there.
How do we change their minds?

14:15.786 --> 14:17.779
I'm not sure we can.

14:17.913 --> 14:21.531
It would mean abandoning
their fundamental way of life.

14:22.376 --> 14:27.002
They've managed to turn a dubious
scientific endeavour into dogma.

14:27.131 --> 14:29.622
You don't approve
of genetic engineering?

14:29.758 --> 14:33.092
It was a bad idea
whose time is past.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.129
They've made it succeed.

14:38.809 --> 14:43.352
They've given away their humanity
with this... genetic manipulation.

14:44.189 --> 14:47.273
Many of the qualities
that they breed out...

14:48.610 --> 14:55.063
...uncertainty, self-discovery, the
unknown, are many of the qualities

14:55.200 --> 14:57.323
that make life worth living.

14:58.161 --> 14:59.952
Well, at least, to me.

15:00.997 --> 15:05.244
I wouldn't want to live
knowing that my future was written,

15:05.376 --> 15:08.460
my boundaries had been already set,
would you?

15:09.714 --> 15:13.961
I've asked myself that a lot
during the past few days.

15:16.345 --> 15:18.254
I don't know.

15:18.889 --> 15:23.267
I doubt it. Nevertheless,
it's what they believe in

15:23.394 --> 15:26.928
and it won't be easy
to talk them into leaving.

15:27.773 --> 15:30.976
This leader of theirs, Conor,
seems a reasonable man.

15:32.236 --> 15:34.727
I find him very reasonable.

15:34.863 --> 15:39.525
Open to suggestions,
thoughtful, quite disarming.

15:40.911 --> 15:42.785
The perfect administrator.

15:44.331 --> 15:48.660
I'm sure. Will he leave
when he sees there's no other choice?

15:49.252 --> 15:51.790
I don't know. I hope so.

15:53.131 --> 15:55.622
- You admire him?
- Yes.

16:00.013 --> 16:03.678
Then help him to see the reality

16:04.267 --> 16:06.722
of what may happen to his colony.

16:06.853 --> 16:09.011
If he makes the right decision,

16:09.147 --> 16:12.101
if he's as good
as he's designed to be,

16:12.233 --> 16:14.190
perhaps the others will follow.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.238
If we increase warp transfer
by 80 percent...

16:19.490 --> 16:21.981
It's going
to blow the emitters again.

16:22.118 --> 16:25.237
We won't be able
to hold that power level.

16:25.371 --> 16:28.870
- It just doesn't work.
- Yeah.

16:30.751 --> 16:35.247
I haven't had any sleep.
My eyelids feel like lead weights.

16:53.607 --> 16:55.315
Were you always blind?

16:55.442 --> 16:58.229
I'm sorry. I probably shocked you.

16:58.361 --> 16:59.392
No.

17:00.030 --> 17:01.654
- I'll put it back on.
- Don't.

17:01.781 --> 17:04.568
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

17:05.868 --> 17:09.154
I've never been embarrassed
by this, Hannah. Never.

17:09.289 --> 17:13.950
I was born blind.
I've always been this way.

17:14.836 --> 17:16.709
May I see your visor?

17:17.672 --> 17:19.082
Sure.

17:24.178 --> 17:29.634
So, I guess if I had been conceived
on your world, I wouldn't be here.

17:30.267 --> 17:31.678
No.

17:31.810 --> 17:35.226
I'd have been terminated
as a fertilised cell.

17:35.356 --> 17:39.056
It was the wish of our founders
that no one suffer disability.

17:40.778 --> 17:44.229
Who gave them the right
to decide if I should be here,

17:44.364 --> 17:47.116
if I might
have something to contribute?

17:48.869 --> 17:50.778
I don't know what to say.

17:54.416 --> 17:56.373
Here you go.

18:00.005 --> 18:01.629
How does it work?

18:04.342 --> 18:09.585
The visor scans the spectrum
from one hertz to 100,000 terahertz,

18:09.722 --> 18:14.100
converts it to usable frequencies
and transmits that to my brain.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.718
What about
the data conversion rates?

18:16.854 --> 18:19.013
How do you avoid
a sensory overload?

18:19.399 --> 18:23.147
A bank of pre-processors compresses
the data into pulses.

18:23.277 --> 18:26.195
That way, my visual cortex never...

18:26.322 --> 18:27.864
Wait a minute.

18:28.783 --> 18:31.570
Wait just a minute.

18:32.536 --> 18:36.451
We could send a high-energy pulse
through the tractor system.

18:36.582 --> 18:38.989
Short enough
not to overload the emitters.

18:39.668 --> 18:41.791
The technology is right here.

18:42.921 --> 18:46.540
If we could adapt
those pulse-compression routines

18:46.675 --> 18:48.881
and apply them to the conduits...

18:49.011 --> 18:51.418
We have to avoid
tractor-force rebounding.

18:51.555 --> 18:54.721
- That shouldn't be hard.
- With a few modifications...

18:57.602 --> 18:59.394
That's perfect.

18:59.771 --> 19:00.802
What?

19:01.356 --> 19:05.519
If the answer is in a visor,
created for a blind man,

19:05.652 --> 19:08.273
who never would've existed
in your society.

19:09.072 --> 19:10.815
No offence intended.

20:04.501 --> 20:06.328
Please, Matthew, continue.

20:39.326 --> 20:41.485
It's hard to believe.

20:42.037 --> 20:47.577
So much loveliness here, just metres
away from such desolation.

20:47.710 --> 20:50.248
It's hard to believe
we're about to lose it.

20:51.422 --> 20:53.959
This may sound
incredibly simplistic,

20:54.091 --> 20:58.717
but can't you re-engineer all this
on another planet?

21:00.430 --> 21:04.973
A nursery rhyme has been in my mind
since all this began.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.014
A nursery rhyme?

21:09.105 --> 21:13.518
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

21:13.652 --> 21:16.771
All the King's horses
and all the King's men

21:16.905 --> 21:18.981
couldn't put Humpty together again.

21:19.991 --> 21:22.862
Why do we tell children
such ghastly stories?

21:22.994 --> 21:25.911
Perhaps to prepare them
for times like these.

21:27.582 --> 21:31.033
We are every bit as fragile
as an egg.

21:31.169 --> 21:33.292
And as impossible to reconstruct.

21:34.046 --> 21:37.296
We are integrated and refined
to such a degree

21:37.425 --> 21:40.379
any fundamental change
would lead to chaos.

21:41.137 --> 21:46.095
I'm so sorry, Aaron.
I wish I could do something to help.

21:47.560 --> 21:49.184
You have helped.

21:49.311 --> 21:52.098
You've been wonderful
these past few days.

21:52.231 --> 21:54.473
You've been my counsellor.

21:54.983 --> 22:00.903
No. A counsellor has to maintain
a discreet distance.

22:01.823 --> 22:04.397
I'd rather think of us as friends.

22:04.534 --> 22:06.077
Friends?

22:06.995 --> 22:08.655
That won't do, either.

22:11.750 --> 22:14.704
- Will it?
- Aaron...

22:16.546 --> 22:18.420
I must confess,

22:18.548 --> 22:22.712
part of me knows that
if I transport through these walls,

22:22.844 --> 22:25.216
you'll be on the other side.

22:30.977 --> 22:33.219
This is wrong.

22:33.354 --> 22:34.979
Terribly wrong.

22:44.824 --> 22:47.196
In order to move the fragment,

22:47.326 --> 22:50.280
we needed our tractor beam
to handle pulses.

22:50.412 --> 22:52.701
We needed a more efficient emitter.

22:52.831 --> 22:54.539
Four times more.

22:54.667 --> 22:57.703
We couldn't get that
without overloading the arrays.

22:57.836 --> 23:00.506
So, we added
a little visor technology

23:00.631 --> 23:02.588
and we could boost the force

23:02.716 --> 23:05.717
and lower
the power-conduit stress levels.

23:10.432 --> 23:14.560
- The increase in efficiency?
- Up to almost 300 percent.

23:14.686 --> 23:16.394
- That's not enough.
- True.

23:16.521 --> 23:19.059
We won't move the fragment far.

23:19.191 --> 23:24.695
But if we also fortify
the biosphere...

23:24.821 --> 23:27.027
With shields like yours
it could work.

23:27.157 --> 23:30.157
Of course, we have to lend them
support crews.

23:32.453 --> 23:35.620
Advise Mr Conor and
brief the appropriate officers.

23:35.748 --> 23:39.200
Prepare for transport
as soon as Mr Conor approves.

23:48.010 --> 23:49.635
You're up early.

23:50.179 --> 23:52.088
I'm still on Enterprise time.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.346
I'm going back to the ship.

24:01.690 --> 24:05.522
- I'm not going to see you again.
- Why?

24:07.237 --> 24:09.313
Because it's the right thing to do.

24:10.199 --> 24:11.990
I'm not convinced of that.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.569
You know it, as well.

24:17.372 --> 24:20.243
- You're angry.
- Yes, I'm angry.

24:22.586 --> 24:25.041
I'm angry I allowed this to happen.

24:29.592 --> 24:32.842
I could fall in love with you
so easily.

24:33.680 --> 24:37.808
But we both know
the end of that story, don't we?

24:38.518 --> 24:40.760
How would Martin feel
about introducing

24:40.895 --> 24:43.849
half-Betazoid DNA
into the genetic balance?

24:46.526 --> 24:48.684
If we evacuate,
anything's possible.

24:51.072 --> 24:52.780
Listen to yourself.

24:53.282 --> 24:56.698
A few days ago
you wouldn't talk to us.

25:02.499 --> 25:04.291
This is my fault.

25:05.377 --> 25:06.955
I'm so sorry.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.837
I need you here.

25:11.550 --> 25:13.673
This doesn't have to happen again.

25:14.887 --> 25:16.546
I have to go.

25:21.518 --> 25:23.096
Good news, Aaron.

25:23.228 --> 25:25.849
We can change
the course of the fragment.

25:25.981 --> 25:28.472
But we need
to fortify the structure.

25:28.608 --> 25:30.352
And we need help.

25:30.485 --> 25:34.981
Engineering crews from the Enterprise
will work with your people.

25:35.907 --> 25:37.235
Engineering crews?

25:37.367 --> 25:40.783
They have to install shield
generators and power supplies.

25:40.912 --> 25:44.577
50 officers are waiting
for your approval to transport down.

25:51.923 --> 25:53.880
We don't have much time.

25:54.467 --> 25:57.503
- Is there any other choice?
- None.

26:02.057 --> 26:04.845
Enterprise, you may begin transport
when ready.

26:34.673 --> 26:36.333
Captain's log, supplemental.

26:36.466 --> 26:40.629
The Enterprise is on a parallel
course with the fragment.

26:40.762 --> 26:44.047
We must adjust its trajectory
by 1.2 degrees

26:44.182 --> 26:46.887
to ensure the colonists' safety.

26:47.018 --> 26:49.888
Bring us within range
of the fragment, Ensign.

26:53.149 --> 26:54.691
You may proceed, Mr La Forge.

26:54.817 --> 26:57.652
- Yes, sir. Good luck.
- You, too.

27:02.116 --> 27:04.109
Engage tractor beam.

27:09.874 --> 27:13.040
OK. Let's give it a try.

27:13.168 --> 27:15.375
Shutting down non-critical systems.

27:15.504 --> 27:18.375
Emitter circuits 170 percent
over standard.

27:21.176 --> 27:24.011
Increasing impulse power
to tractor emitters.

27:24.137 --> 27:25.845
EPS power-levels rising.

27:25.973 --> 27:28.380
Transferring warp power
to tractor beam.

27:30.018 --> 27:32.889
Graviton generators
operating normally.

27:33.021 --> 27:35.477
Surge pulse now synchronised.

27:36.274 --> 27:39.275
Emitters radiating
at 320 percent over standard.

27:39.402 --> 27:41.229
Bridge, we need more power.

27:42.238 --> 27:45.323
- Reduce life support to minimum.
- Aye, sir.

27:51.122 --> 27:53.079
390 percent over standard.

27:53.666 --> 27:55.208
Come on, come on.

27:55.960 --> 27:59.543
- No change in course.
- Increase pulse frequency.

27:59.672 --> 28:03.456
- The circuits won't hold.
- We don't need them for long.

28:08.055 --> 28:10.890
- 400 percent over standard.
- OK.

28:11.016 --> 28:12.890
Now we're getting there.

28:13.018 --> 28:16.221
Fragment's moved 0.4 degrees
off its previous heading.

28:16.355 --> 28:18.264
0.65. It's working.

28:21.485 --> 28:23.608
We have lost an emitter circuit.

28:23.737 --> 28:26.821
Life-support failure.
Decks nine, 12 and 13.

28:27.199 --> 28:30.698
Evacuate those decks. Geordi,
we're going to need power back soon.

28:30.827 --> 28:31.823
Acknowledged.

28:32.996 --> 28:36.614
Fragment's new heading adjustment
is at 1.01 degrees.

28:36.750 --> 28:39.157
- Is it enough?
- Not yet.

28:39.294 --> 28:41.500
We've lost a second circuit.

28:41.630 --> 28:44.998
Losing life support
on decks five through nine.

28:45.133 --> 28:46.924
Evacuation initiated.

28:47.051 --> 28:49.459
- Mr La Forge.
- Hold on, Captain.

28:50.346 --> 28:53.680
Ship-wide life-support failure
in 15 seconds, sir.

28:53.808 --> 28:57.058
Almost there.
Core shift is at 1.16 degrees.

28:57.687 --> 29:00.688
Termination of all life support
in five seconds.

29:00.815 --> 29:02.274
1.18.

29:02.400 --> 29:03.775
Now, Mr La Forge.

29:03.901 --> 29:06.902
Yes, sir. Shutting down
all tractor emissions.

29:07.029 --> 29:09.236
Transferring power to life support.

29:13.285 --> 29:17.413
1.2. We've got it!

29:20.417 --> 29:22.493
Life support normal on all decks.

29:22.836 --> 29:24.165
Mr Data?

29:24.296 --> 29:27.795
The fragment's course has been
altered by 1.21 degrees, sir.

29:28.425 --> 29:29.836
Hail the colony.

29:32.638 --> 29:35.389
- Yes, Captain.
- Success, Mr Conor.

29:35.515 --> 29:39.809
With the upgrades, the fragment
should no longer be a danger.

29:40.395 --> 29:43.894
I cannot adequately express
my appreciation.

29:44.024 --> 29:45.482
Can Hannah hear me?

29:46.610 --> 29:50.773
- Yes. Go ahead, Aaron.
- An historic achievement.

29:50.905 --> 29:53.277
You've done a wonderful thing.

29:53.408 --> 29:54.688
Thank you.

29:55.160 --> 29:57.995
We look forward
to honouring you when you return.

29:59.163 --> 30:01.833
Thank you again, Captain.
Conor out.

30:15.805 --> 30:17.382
Captain's log, supplemental.

30:17.515 --> 30:20.848
The fragment has passed out
of the Moab System.

30:20.976 --> 30:25.638
The colony was shaken but
fortunately there were no injuries.

30:25.773 --> 30:27.812
Only minor damage was reported.

30:31.153 --> 30:32.398
Energise.

30:39.453 --> 30:42.904
That should do it.
All crew are accounted for.

30:43.039 --> 30:45.365
They've been invaluable.
Thank you.

30:45.500 --> 30:47.576
If there's nothing else, we'll go.

30:48.670 --> 30:51.457
Would you tell Deanna Troi
that I'm sorry

30:51.589 --> 30:55.254
I didn't get
the opportunity to say goodbye?

30:56.261 --> 30:57.921
I'm sure she is, too.

30:58.972 --> 31:02.341
A breach in the biosphere.
Get Hannah Bates.

31:09.816 --> 31:14.892
The refortification wasn't adequate.
There's definite structural damage.

31:15.029 --> 31:17.698
The tectonic shifts created a breach.

31:17.823 --> 31:19.401
Can it be repaired?

31:19.533 --> 31:22.487
I don't know.
I'll run a diagnostic.

31:22.620 --> 31:25.704
Unless we seal it,
we may have to evacuate.

31:25.831 --> 31:30.244
- How long do we have?
- With the toxicity outside, hours.

31:30.377 --> 31:32.702
- Mind if I give her a hand?
- By all means.

31:42.514 --> 31:45.598
Isn't it amazing
after all we went through?

31:45.726 --> 31:48.596
Yeah. Amazing.

31:49.646 --> 31:52.730
Looks bad. It's cracked
well beneath the surface.

31:53.858 --> 31:56.776
- Why are you doing this?
- What do you mean?

31:56.903 --> 31:58.694
There's no breach.

31:58.822 --> 32:03.234
What are you talking about?
Look at it, it's right here.

32:03.368 --> 32:05.491
I measured the toxic leak.
You saw me.

32:07.580 --> 32:10.866
My visor's positronic scan
would have detected the leak.

32:11.501 --> 32:16.376
Its molecular-pattern enhancer would
pick up even the smallest crack.

32:21.052 --> 32:24.385
The damn thing doesn't miss much,
does it?

32:24.513 --> 32:27.514
Fine. I'll tell them the truth.

32:27.641 --> 32:29.385
Will that make you happy?

32:31.186 --> 32:33.938
Why are you doing this?

32:37.609 --> 32:43.030
I was born to be one of the best
scientific minds of my generation.

32:43.156 --> 32:47.902
In five days, I have encountered
technology I had barely imagined.

32:48.995 --> 32:50.869
I've got to ask myself,

32:50.997 --> 32:55.077
if we're so brilliant, how come
we didn't invent these things?

32:56.544 --> 33:00.293
Maybe necessity really
is the mother of invention.

33:01.341 --> 33:04.507
You never look for something
until you need it.

33:04.636 --> 33:10.140
But all my needs have been
planned for before I was even born.

33:10.266 --> 33:14.216
All of us
have been living in the Dark Ages.

33:14.354 --> 33:18.221
It's like we're victims
of a 200-year-old joke.

33:18.357 --> 33:22.651
Till you came, all we saw
was the wall of our biosphere.

33:22.778 --> 33:26.278
Suddenly, our eyes are open
to infinite possibilities.

33:27.033 --> 33:30.117
- Asylum?
- She wants to leave the colony.

33:30.578 --> 33:32.903
She may not be the only one.

33:33.038 --> 33:36.407
The science teams fielded
a lot of questions from colonists

33:36.542 --> 33:39.661
who were curious
about what's outside their world.

33:39.795 --> 33:42.998
- Why shouldn't we grant asylum?
- We can't.

33:43.132 --> 33:46.750
- We have to.
- Do you understand that colony?

33:46.885 --> 33:50.503
I understand that these
are human beings with free will.

33:50.639 --> 33:52.631
She has the right to leave.

33:52.766 --> 33:55.720
What happens to the colony
if others join her?

33:56.311 --> 34:01.187
The society is genetically
integrated. There would be gaps.

34:01.608 --> 34:03.232
It would destroy them.

34:04.069 --> 34:06.476
There must be something we can do.

34:06.613 --> 34:09.732
We may have done too much already.

34:09.866 --> 34:13.116
- We saved them from destruction.
- Did we?

34:14.996 --> 34:19.409
Counsellor, I think it's time
you took me to meet Mr Conor.

34:24.297 --> 34:25.920
Transporter room three.

34:28.634 --> 34:30.259
Computer, halt.

34:33.806 --> 34:36.641
Captain,
I have to tell you something.

34:37.518 --> 34:42.512
It isn't easy because
I've used very poor judgement.

34:42.648 --> 34:46.016
- I've acted unprofessionally.
- Counsellor.

34:47.110 --> 34:49.898
What is it you say?
"Take a deep breath."

34:53.158 --> 34:55.862
Conor and I
have had a relationship.

34:58.747 --> 35:02.661
- I see.
- It should never have happened.

35:03.418 --> 35:07.879
I knew there was concern
about outside influences and...

35:09.090 --> 35:11.297
I should have been more careful.

35:15.847 --> 35:20.972
- What is your status with him now?
- I did not intend to see him again.

35:22.145 --> 35:24.102
Would you prefer not to return?

35:24.230 --> 35:27.017
No, I think I should come with you.

35:27.150 --> 35:29.605
I wanted you to know before we went.

35:32.071 --> 35:33.695
I appreciate that.

35:34.782 --> 35:36.406
Computer, resume.

35:41.830 --> 35:43.788
I wanted to help him.

35:45.042 --> 35:48.707
To be there for him,
but the more I was...

35:51.548 --> 35:54.218
We all went into this
with the best intentions.

35:55.302 --> 35:57.840
I should have walked away.

35:58.472 --> 36:04.889
But you didn't. And that's human.
We make mistakes.

36:06.897 --> 36:10.977
Genetic manipulation or not,
nobody's perfect.

36:19.367 --> 36:21.823
You would ignore
the welfare of the colony

36:21.953 --> 36:24.325
for your own selfish interests!

36:24.455 --> 36:28.323
The welfare of this colony
lies in rejoining the human race.

36:28.459 --> 36:31.294
She has been contaminated
by those people.

36:36.217 --> 36:38.886
Mr Conor, you and I should talk.

36:39.011 --> 36:42.261
This is your doing.
We never should have answered.

36:42.389 --> 36:45.390
If we followed that advice,
we'd all be dead.

36:45.518 --> 36:48.969
- So much for welfare.
- You will not take her.

36:49.104 --> 36:53.813
I'm leaving! A dozen others
are ready to go with me.

36:55.194 --> 36:58.360
Let's allow Aaron and Capt Picard
to discuss this.

36:58.488 --> 37:00.113
Why don't we go for a walk?

37:02.951 --> 37:05.407
There's nothing else for them
to talk about.

37:12.252 --> 37:13.580
I think...

37:13.712 --> 37:15.953
I want to talk to him alone.

37:16.089 --> 37:18.247
- But...
- Thank you, Martin.

37:25.515 --> 37:29.809
The irony is, he saw this coming
from the moment you arrived.

37:30.520 --> 37:33.889
I didn't want to hear,
so I chose not to listen.

37:34.232 --> 37:38.099
You made decisions
you felt would save your colony.

37:38.236 --> 37:43.360
No. I wish it were that simple.

37:43.491 --> 37:46.741
I'm afraid
I can't forgive myself so easily.

37:47.536 --> 37:52.032
You see, Captain,
I know what Hannah Bates is feeling.

37:53.042 --> 37:55.165
I've been feeling it as well.

37:56.503 --> 38:00.964
I've found your people as intriguing
and stimulating as she has.

38:01.842 --> 38:05.674
I've been as curious
about you as the next man.

38:05.804 --> 38:09.754
But I am not the next man.
I am the leader of these people.

38:09.891 --> 38:13.723
Every fibre in my being
demands that I protect them.

38:13.854 --> 38:15.930
Instead, I have betrayed them.

38:16.690 --> 38:21.398
- I allowed this to happen.
- We both allowed this to happen.

38:21.528 --> 38:25.608
Then let us both find a way
to stop it going further.

38:26.366 --> 38:28.773
I wish I could see a way.

38:30.161 --> 38:35.072
Picard, I was born to govern
this colony, not to dismantle it.

38:35.208 --> 38:39.075
If you force them to stay,
you suppress their human rights.

38:39.420 --> 38:43.714
If even a handful leave,
the damage will be devastating.

38:44.342 --> 38:48.838
What about the rights of those
who stay and inherit social chaos,

38:48.971 --> 38:51.177
that will follow for generations?

38:52.641 --> 38:55.595
Your arrival created this problem.

38:55.728 --> 38:58.894
- Your departure solves it.
- That is simplistic.

38:59.023 --> 39:00.980
Refuse them passage.

39:01.608 --> 39:06.816
I cannot ignore
the requests of people, humans,

39:06.947 --> 39:09.153
who ask for transport away from here.

39:09.283 --> 39:14.110
But thousands will suffer
if you agree to take them.

39:14.246 --> 39:17.365
As suffering grows,
more will demand to leave.

39:18.083 --> 39:21.000
We are witnessing
the end of this existence.

39:21.294 --> 39:24.959
I implore you, Captain,
do not let this happen.

39:26.299 --> 39:29.750
You would have me make the decision
for you, but I can't.

39:30.512 --> 39:33.347
I am willing
to talk to these people with you.

39:33.473 --> 39:36.474
I will urge them
not to be impulsive

39:36.601 --> 39:39.767
but if finally
they choose to leave...

39:41.606 --> 39:44.097
...the Enterprise
will not turn them away.

39:59.331 --> 40:04.408
Capt Picard will grant transport
to any individuals who wish to leave.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.127
I am asking you to stay.

40:08.507 --> 40:13.881
Aaron, don't you see
we can't be happy here any longer?

40:14.554 --> 40:18.006
We were innocent.
It will never be that way again.

40:18.767 --> 40:22.385
The experience
will become part of our heritage.

40:23.605 --> 40:27.104
We will adjust.
In a few generations...

40:27.233 --> 40:30.187
We're not willing
to stay a few generations.

40:31.654 --> 40:33.279
Alright.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.656
Give me six months.

40:37.994 --> 40:41.908
- Just wait six months.
- What will that accomplish?

40:42.040 --> 40:46.452
It's true that our presence
has had an unintended influence

40:46.586 --> 40:47.831
on your society.

40:47.962 --> 40:51.129
But it's done.
There is no way to undo it.

40:51.257 --> 40:53.748
But feelings are running very high.

40:53.884 --> 40:58.214
Perhaps it's not such a bad idea
that you should take time

40:58.347 --> 41:02.641
to weigh carefully the consequences
of what you're about to do.

41:02.768 --> 41:05.437
We are prepared
to return in six months.

41:05.562 --> 41:08.599
In other words,
we are being asked to stay here

41:08.732 --> 41:11.650
while they pressure us
to change our minds.

41:12.361 --> 41:15.611
In five days, you've seen
the most superficial evidence

41:15.739 --> 41:18.195
of what life is like
outside this biosphere.

41:18.742 --> 41:22.193
Would you choose
this ship in a bottle?

41:22.329 --> 41:24.701
You are in command of a starship.

41:24.831 --> 41:28.615
You live for the unknown.
We ask the same privilege.

41:31.254 --> 41:33.247
This is your home.

41:33.381 --> 41:35.919
We are all, in a sense,
your family.

41:36.801 --> 41:40.751
Don't we deserve
to open a dialogue on this issue?

41:41.598 --> 41:45.642
- I am only asking for six months.
- It won't make any difference.

41:45.768 --> 41:49.813
You'll only put the colony
through unnecessary pain.

41:49.939 --> 41:53.889
You are the ones causing pain
in this colony. You.

41:54.026 --> 41:59.151
Don't you see? It's over.
It's time to lead us into a new era.

41:59.281 --> 42:01.772
You could come with us.

42:04.703 --> 42:08.653
When you're ready to come home,
you will be welcome.

42:18.634 --> 42:20.342
What will you do now?

42:20.928 --> 42:22.837
Attempt to assess the damage.

42:23.889 --> 42:26.890
Spend the rest of my life
on the near-impossible task

42:27.017 --> 42:30.801
of rebuilding this society
without the proper pieces.

42:30.937 --> 42:34.271
You acted in the interests
of your people.

42:34.399 --> 42:36.724
There was no way to avoid
what happened.

42:36.860 --> 42:42.281
I replay each step, looking for the
wrong turn, a mistake in judgement.

42:43.575 --> 42:45.781
I can find only one.

42:46.160 --> 42:50.490
And as hard as I try,
I cannot regret even that one.

42:51.624 --> 42:55.289
In fact, I'm quite certain that,
given the opportunity...

42:56.337 --> 42:58.875
...I would choose to make it again.

42:59.840 --> 43:04.052
I wonder why, with all
these genetically compatible women,

43:04.178 --> 43:07.796
- I fell in love with you.
- Don't say that.

43:08.766 --> 43:12.182
Perhaps it's your imperfections
which make you so unique.

43:13.854 --> 43:16.938
But I am in love with you,
Deanna Troi.

43:18.650 --> 43:20.690
And I will always be.

43:44.175 --> 43:44.957
Come.

43:47.679 --> 43:49.552
The colonists are on board.

43:49.681 --> 43:52.053
- How many finally?
- 23.

43:52.183 --> 43:56.228
If ever we needed reminding
of the Prime Directive, it is now.

43:56.354 --> 43:59.189
The Prime Directive doesn't apply.
They're human.

43:59.315 --> 44:00.595
Doesn't it?

44:00.733 --> 44:03.520
Our very presence
may have damaged,

44:04.403 --> 44:06.479
even destroyed, their way of life.

44:06.614 --> 44:09.105
Whether or not we agree
with that way of life,

44:09.241 --> 44:14.402
or whether they're human,
is irrelevant. We are responsible.

44:14.914 --> 44:18.745
We had to respond
to the threat of the core fragment.

44:18.876 --> 44:20.536
Of course we did.

44:21.336 --> 44:26.544
But in the end, we may have proved
just as dangerous

44:26.675 --> 44:29.759
as any core fragment
could ever have been.
