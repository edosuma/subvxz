00:01.317 --> 00:04.753
I'm Mike Filgenberg,
WNKW 10:00 news.

00:04.921 --> 00:07.947
We're gonna take you live now
to Janice Langis on the scene...

00:08.124 --> 00:09.591
...at another Boston homicide.

00:09.759 --> 00:11.818
The body was found here, by Pier 7.

00:11.995 --> 00:14.156
Police are canvassing the area.

00:14.330 --> 00:18.460
No witnesses have come forward
at this time, and authorities are baffled...

00:18.635 --> 00:22.401
...by what appears to be one of the most
gruesome murders in Boston's history.

00:22.572 --> 00:24.836
The media has been blocked
from the crime scene.

00:25.008 --> 00:27.499
All we've been told
is a body was found mutilated...

00:27.711 --> 00:29.736
...by what might have been
a hunting knife.

00:29.913 --> 00:33.849
Police are withholding the name of the
victim until their family can be contacted.

00:34.017 --> 00:37.248
There are a number of nightclubs,
it's not the safest neighborhood.

00:37.420 --> 00:40.082
There haven't been violent crimes
of this nature before.

00:40.256 --> 00:42.486
Until someone with information
comes forward...

00:42.659 --> 00:47.221
...police have no clues in this bizarre
murder that occurred here tonight.

00:58.742 --> 01:01.267
- Hello, beautiful.
- Finally. Where have you been?

01:01.444 --> 01:03.309
- Did you get my message?
- I did.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.277
But you didn't call me back.

01:05.447 --> 01:07.143
No, I thought I'd call you later.

01:07.317 --> 01:10.013
- How was the conference?
- Where were you last night, Bob?

01:10.186 --> 01:13.178
Where would I be? I was at home.
I was catching up on my sleep.

01:13.356 --> 01:16.951
- But I called.
- I turn off the phone to get some sleep.

01:17.127 --> 01:19.152
You're starting to go down
that road again.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.320
Before you know it, you'll be all upset.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.830
This has more to do
with the miles between us.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.161
All that dreary weather you have
in Portland.

01:26.336 --> 01:29.999
You'll feel better when you get back
tomorrow. Hey, we'll do something nice.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.970
In fact, we'll stay in.

01:32.142 --> 01:33.734
I'll cook for us.

01:33.910 --> 01:35.138
I'd like that, Bob.

01:35.311 --> 01:37.802
Listen, love,
I'll call you when I get home tonight.

01:37.981 --> 01:41.849
Right now, I gotta go have dinner with
these insufferable suits from Hong Kong.

01:42.018 --> 01:44.680
I hope it won't be too awful.

01:45.722 --> 01:47.656
You never can tell.

01:47.824 --> 01:49.348
Bye.

02:32.869 --> 02:34.200
You know what's funny?

02:34.704 --> 02:37.867
Before I came in here,
I thought I was good looking.

02:42.212 --> 02:45.443
Seriously.
I can tell you're my type of girl.

02:45.615 --> 02:46.877
How do you know?

02:47.383 --> 02:48.543
I know these things.

02:58.161 --> 02:59.958
Cheers, mate.

03:22.018 --> 03:24.111
I can tell you're my kind of girl.

05:03.886 --> 05:07.083
Oh, Olivia, you have to hear
how Neil and Helen met.

05:07.590 --> 05:09.581
This could be good for my sister.

05:09.759 --> 05:12.819
We're both single,
we're in our 30s, hadn't met anyone.

05:12.996 --> 05:14.156
We wanted to have kids.

05:14.364 --> 05:17.663
Then I heard about this program
called Two Singles Together.

05:17.867 --> 05:21.598
Two Singles Together
was the answer for us.

05:21.771 --> 05:22.897
I'm sorry. Two?

05:23.072 --> 05:26.633
- Two Singles Together.
- It's a matchmaking service.

05:26.809 --> 05:29.903
Not just a matchmaking service,
Rachel.

05:30.079 --> 05:32.240
- A way of life.
- Two Singles Together?

05:32.749 --> 05:35.411
I have my own schedule.
Works for me.

05:35.585 --> 05:38.349
I have no interest
in controlling Neil's either.

05:38.521 --> 05:40.455
I like vacations in the sun and...

05:40.623 --> 05:41.920
- I like the snow.
- Right.

05:42.091 --> 05:45.959
Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose
of being in a relationship?

05:46.929 --> 05:51.093
Well, there are things we agree on,
of course.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.497
Like, um, where to live.

05:53.669 --> 05:55.466
- Yeah.
- The appropriate kindergarten.

05:55.638 --> 05:58.106
Friends we both enjoy.

05:58.274 --> 06:01.710
Incidentally, I wanna make sure Ella
can attend Graham's birthday party.

06:01.911 --> 06:04.345
Oh, I already RSVP'd
on the class sign-up.

06:04.514 --> 06:07.347
No, no. That was for Neil's
rock-climbing party for Graham.

06:07.517 --> 06:10.281
My party for Graham
is the following Saturday.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.478
We are doing Science Center.

06:15.058 --> 06:17.049
Excuse me for one minute.

06:21.497 --> 06:24.295
I wish you would stop talking
about Two Singles Together.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.561
I thought they'd be interested.
I mean, Olivia's single.

06:28.538 --> 06:30.665
Oh, thanks, Olivia.

06:30.840 --> 06:33.536
I think you had enough to drink, Neil.

06:33.709 --> 06:34.733
What?

06:36.679 --> 06:39.580
Greg's filing for divorce.

06:41.384 --> 06:45.718
- Oh, Rach.
- Not now. Not in front of them.

06:47.090 --> 06:50.218
They'll make me join
Two Singles Together.

07:00.069 --> 07:01.866
Okay, where were we?

07:03.106 --> 07:05.267
I'm sorry.
I've just been called into work.

07:05.475 --> 07:07.773
Oh, what kind of work do you do,
Olivia?

07:09.078 --> 07:12.070
Victim's name was Bob Dunn.
He was 33 years old.

07:13.483 --> 07:16.281
His girlfriend got back
from a business trip in Portland...

07:16.486 --> 07:18.750
...couldn't reach him.
She found him here.

07:18.921 --> 07:22.220
We confirmed her trip.
No forced entry, no witnesses.

07:22.391 --> 07:26.384
So this matched the victim that Boston
P.D. found two nights ago at the pier?

07:26.562 --> 07:30.225
- The one that's been all over the news?
- They don't know what to make of it.

07:30.399 --> 07:33.766
So now they have another one.
Now it's ours to make something of.

07:33.936 --> 07:35.961
- You know what this reminds me of?
- No.

07:36.139 --> 07:39.575
But I'm gonna guess it's something
unbelievably disgusting.

07:39.742 --> 07:41.403
Shrimp cocktail.

07:42.311 --> 07:47.715
You see, shrimp must be deveined by
putting a shallow cut down the back...

07:47.884 --> 07:51.376
...to expose the vein,
which in fact is not a vein at all...

07:51.554 --> 07:54.751
...but the crustacean's intestinal tract.
- Great. Thanks for that.

07:54.924 --> 07:57.620
Another foodstuff
I can cross off the menu for life.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.725
- Hey, are you okay?
- What?

08:02.899 --> 08:05.129
Well, you were awfully quiet
on the car ride...

08:05.301 --> 08:09.067
...and you just don't seem your normal
chipper self at a bloody crime scene.

08:09.238 --> 08:11.468
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm...

08:12.475 --> 08:13.840
It's just home stuff.

08:14.844 --> 08:17.074
Well, I know from home stuff.

08:17.246 --> 08:20.340
I live with the guy
inspecting a severed spine.

08:20.550 --> 08:22.313
This is fascinating.

08:22.952 --> 08:27.150
These appear to be bite marks.

08:27.323 --> 08:31.089
See how the flesh is ripped
in the jagged markings.

08:31.861 --> 08:34.159
Canine or even ursine. But human?

08:34.330 --> 08:36.662
You're suggesting
that someone chewed his spine?

08:36.832 --> 08:39.664
Yes. And with a jaw strength...

08:39.835 --> 08:42.429
...well in excess of that
of a normal human being.

08:42.605 --> 08:45.039
Great.
Well, maybe we're looking for Dracula.

08:45.208 --> 08:49.975
Ha-ha! Finally, son, you are opening
your mind to new possibilities.

08:50.146 --> 08:54.480
But no, there are no vampires, sadly.

08:55.318 --> 08:58.151
But it will be something exciting,
I'm sure.

09:03.292 --> 09:05.021
We have another monster
on the loose?

09:05.194 --> 09:08.857
No, sir. Walter says that the teeth marks
are definitely human.

09:09.031 --> 09:12.831
I can just about remember a suspect
being human was a given, not an option.

09:13.002 --> 09:16.301
Bob Dunn's girlfriend said
that he had a car, an Audi A4.

09:16.472 --> 09:20.306
It wasn't in the garage, and we couldn't
find it when we did a two-block sweep.

09:20.476 --> 09:22.535
- Local P.D. is on it?
- We could get lucky.

09:22.712 --> 09:25.203
- Maybe the killer took it.
- And Dr. Bishop?

09:25.381 --> 09:27.872
He's at the lab with both bodies
doing autopsies.

09:28.050 --> 09:29.176
Okay.

09:29.352 --> 09:31.684
Well,
let me know if you learn anything.

09:34.490 --> 09:35.650
Is there something else?

09:37.393 --> 09:39.384
This may sound impolitic, sir...

09:39.562 --> 09:43.726
...but I was wondering if you were
satisfied with your divorce attorney.

09:48.204 --> 09:52.197
I've heard you talking on the phone
to your kids, but never to your wife.

09:56.445 --> 09:58.208
I was satisfied.

09:58.381 --> 09:59.507
Except for the bill.

10:01.350 --> 10:04.842
I was wondering if I might be able
to get the name and number.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.560
It should be waiting in your inbox.

10:15.731 --> 10:18.723
- Thank you.
- I hope things work out for your sister.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.364
I pay attention too, Agent Dunham.

10:27.543 --> 10:33.038
C1 cervical vertebrae is connected
to the C2 cervical vertebrae.

10:33.215 --> 10:36.480
The C2 cervical vertebrae is connected
to the C3 cervical vertebrae.

10:36.686 --> 10:39.211
- Walter, that's enough.
- When you meet a nice girl...

10:39.388 --> 10:42.380
...I would avoid bringing her home
for as long as possible.

10:42.558 --> 10:44.924
This is the lab work you requested
on the victims.

10:45.094 --> 10:46.459
Excellent.

10:46.629 --> 10:50.121
It may help us understand
why their spinal columns...

10:50.299 --> 10:52.665
...have been completely drained
of spinal fluid.

10:52.835 --> 10:56.430
The killer took the victims' spinal fluid?
Why would they do that?

10:56.605 --> 10:59.631
Where would the fun be
if we already knew all there is to know?

11:01.077 --> 11:02.476
This is interesting.

11:02.645 --> 11:05.341
Traces of Treponema pallidum.

11:05.514 --> 11:07.812
That's the syphilis bacteria.

11:07.983 --> 11:10.247
In the victim's neck and back.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.444
Most likely from the killer's saliva.

11:13.456 --> 11:14.787
So the killer has syphilis?

11:14.957 --> 11:17.585
- Seems so.
- Great. I should have worn gloves.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.153
And what's even more fascinating...

11:20.329 --> 11:23.924
...this particular strain of syphilis
is extinct.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.590
Has been for decades.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.931
How could the killer be exposed
to an extinct strain of syphilis?

11:29.105 --> 11:30.470
See, isn't this fun?

11:34.009 --> 11:37.103
I appreciate the CDC's prompt response
on this matter.

11:37.279 --> 11:39.372
Of course. I ran an index search.

11:39.548 --> 11:41.880
A sample of that particular
strain of syphilis...

11:42.051 --> 11:46.351
...was shipped out four weeks ago
to a Lubov Pharmaceuticals.

11:46.522 --> 11:48.353
They have a local address in Brighton.

11:48.524 --> 11:51.186
Well, thank you,
but a phone call would have sufficed.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.828
Actually,
I'm not sure that it would have.

11:53.996 --> 11:56.521
Because their address
is in a residential area.

11:56.699 --> 12:00.032
I took the liberty of running the rest of
Lubov's research requests...

12:00.202 --> 12:02.636
...over the past few years.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.399
This isn't the first contagion
they've ordered from us.

12:05.574 --> 12:09.203
In fact, there have been quite a few.

12:13.682 --> 12:15.377
We need to show this to Broyles.

12:15.551 --> 12:18.213
Any reputable scientist
with appropriate credentials...

12:18.387 --> 12:23.825
...can procure samples of bacteria
and viruses for their research.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.427
In addition
to the extinct syphilis bacterium...

12:26.595 --> 12:31.259
...Lubov Pharmaceuticals also procured
a sample of a substance called RUD 390.

12:31.434 --> 12:33.231
- Which is?
- A chemical compound...

12:33.402 --> 12:35.529
...used in the construction of
bioweapons.

12:36.038 --> 12:38.404
You suggesting
whoever is behind these killings...

12:38.574 --> 12:41.839
...may be planning a biological attack?
- Or has before.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.070
RUD 390
was one of the components...

12:44.246 --> 12:47.511
...of the rapid-skin-growth toxin
that killed Agent Kent.

12:47.683 --> 12:48.911
You're saying this is ZFT?

12:49.552 --> 12:51.577
ZFT?

12:51.754 --> 12:52.948
What's that?

12:53.122 --> 12:55.716
We believe ZFT
is a terrorist organization...

12:55.891 --> 12:59.019
...responsible for a number of bioattacks
in the last year.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.856
I see.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.722
Why? What is their agenda?

13:04.233 --> 13:05.757
That's what we wanna find out.

13:06.735 --> 13:08.430
Assemble an assault squad.

13:08.604 --> 13:10.538
- Move on Lubov.
- Yes, sir.

14:07.196 --> 14:09.460
Federal agents. You're under arrest.

14:11.934 --> 14:16.371
Dr. Nicholas Boone. Advanced degrees
in hematology and biochemistry.

14:16.539 --> 14:19.201
Founder of Lubov Pharmaceuticals.

14:19.408 --> 14:22.536
A multinational biotech firm
whose corporate offices...

14:22.711 --> 14:26.044
...turn out to be in a split-level,
in Brighton.

14:28.350 --> 14:32.844
Now, we know that the strain of syphilis
that you ordered was found on his spine.

14:33.022 --> 14:34.990
And you see these?

14:35.157 --> 14:37.216
They're human bite marks.

14:40.496 --> 14:42.225
What is out there doing this?

14:42.831 --> 14:45.129
What happened to these people?

14:49.805 --> 14:51.739
How long have you been a follower
of ZFT?

14:53.709 --> 14:56.075
That's right, Dr. Boone.

14:56.645 --> 14:58.044
We know about ZFT.

14:59.715 --> 15:00.909
What do you know?

15:01.083 --> 15:04.712
Enough to know they're using the world
as a testing ground for experiments.

15:04.887 --> 15:07.253
We wanna know more about
David Robert Jones...

15:07.456 --> 15:09.686
...about who funds ZFT and why.

15:09.858 --> 15:11.655
We wanna know
what we're dealing with.

15:11.827 --> 15:14.091
I don't have to spell it out for you,
Dr. Boone.

15:14.263 --> 15:16.424
You talk to us, give us information...

15:16.599 --> 15:20.194
...help us with whatever's out there
killing people...

15:20.369 --> 15:23.167
...it'll go better for you.
- What is doing this?

15:27.676 --> 15:28.973
What have you done?

15:31.380 --> 15:33.610
- Someone was dosed.
- With what?

15:35.417 --> 15:36.611
Dosed with what?

15:39.188 --> 15:41.520
I know a lot about
the things you want.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.787
And more.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.487
And I'll answer your questions.

15:46.996 --> 15:48.691
But you have to help me first.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.525
Help with what?

15:51.433 --> 15:53.697
They have my wife.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.367
I want you to get her back.

16:06.615 --> 16:08.344
ZFT has your wife?

16:09.218 --> 16:10.446
Agent Dunham...

16:10.619 --> 16:14.453
...what counts with punishment is the
ability to know whom to hurt and when.

16:14.623 --> 16:18.423
You're telling me ZFT is coercing you
to conduct these experiments...

16:18.594 --> 16:20.494
...by threatening to harm your wife?

16:20.663 --> 16:22.654
Why would they be punishing you?

16:22.865 --> 16:26.426
Because when I realized what my work
was being used for...

16:26.602 --> 16:27.762
...I tried to get out.

16:28.270 --> 16:30.761
I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

16:30.939 --> 16:33.669
But first you have to
get my wife back.

16:38.414 --> 16:39.904
Do you believe him?

16:40.916 --> 16:43.180
- I don't.
- Boone's wife is a nurse.

16:43.385 --> 16:46.013
I checked and she hasn't been to work
in three weeks.

16:46.188 --> 16:48.952
- Proves nothing.
- I'm inclined to agree with Agent Francis.

16:49.124 --> 16:52.855
Everything we know about these guys
suggests that they're zealots.

16:53.028 --> 16:55.792
Why don't we go back,
ask why the sudden change of heart?

16:55.964 --> 16:57.693
Can't ask a thing until we get his wife.

16:57.900 --> 16:59.492
- Could be a trap.
- Could be the truth.

16:59.668 --> 17:02.034
I'm sorry, since I've been
working in Fringe Division...

17:02.204 --> 17:04.798
...81 people have lost their lives.

17:04.973 --> 17:08.204
And that's not including the 147
on Flight 627.

17:08.711 --> 17:12.271
In my entire career, only nine people
had died on cases that I worked.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.940
This is the closest that we've ever come
to getting traction...

17:16.117 --> 17:17.710
...on stopping these people.

17:17.920 --> 17:21.685
Getting a handle on ZFT, Jones...

17:21.857 --> 17:23.619
...or more.

17:25.227 --> 17:26.990
This guy could be our chance.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.621
- What is it?
- The address Boone gave us...

17:30.799 --> 17:32.562
...where he says
they're holding his wife...

17:32.735 --> 17:34.202
...it's a restaurant, in Chinatown.

17:34.703 --> 17:37.001
Doesn't exactly scream
ZFT hive of activity.

17:37.172 --> 17:39.504
- They've been tagged by Edison.
- Meaning?

17:39.675 --> 17:41.643
They're burning five times
more power...

17:41.810 --> 17:43.835
...than they should
making Moo shu pork.

17:44.012 --> 17:46.640
They could be using the power
for something else.

17:46.815 --> 17:48.578
To facilitate a laboratory?

17:48.751 --> 17:51.413
This could be our chance
to get to ZFT.

17:51.587 --> 17:53.384
Go get her.

17:54.189 --> 17:56.384
I'll get a team together.

18:00.963 --> 18:02.191
Peter and Walter Bishop.

18:02.364 --> 18:03.831
We're here to catalog the evidence.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.694
Walter Bishop. Nice to meet you.

18:05.868 --> 18:08.530
Hello. Hello. Please, sit down.
Bishop. Walter Bishop.

18:08.704 --> 18:10.672
You don't have
to shake everybody's hand.

18:10.839 --> 18:13.501
He gets a little nervous
around authority figures.

18:14.743 --> 18:16.005
Oh, boy.

18:18.714 --> 18:20.614
Look at that.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.583
Benzyl alcohol.

18:27.756 --> 18:31.590
A colorless liquid used as a bacteriostatic
in solutions for injection.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.455
Topically as a local anesthetic.

18:33.629 --> 18:36.894
Personally,
I like to use it as a mouthwash.

18:38.066 --> 18:39.863
What did this guy create?

18:40.035 --> 18:43.937
From what I've seen so far,
I am forming a hypothesis.

18:44.106 --> 18:45.767
Would you care to hear it?

18:46.275 --> 18:50.234
Well, I don't know. Would I ever be able
to sleep at night again?

18:50.412 --> 18:53.142
- That depends.
- Depends on what?

18:53.315 --> 18:55.579
On whether the light is on or not.

18:58.921 --> 19:00.821
There's four exits.

19:01.023 --> 19:04.481
Risk and Walken, you take the rear.
Taub and Brown, you take the side.

19:04.660 --> 19:06.491
Dunham and I
are gonna be in the front.

19:06.662 --> 19:09.790
Remember, this is a hostage situation
in a contained environment.

19:09.965 --> 19:13.093
So retrieving the hostage unharmed
is our top priority.

19:13.268 --> 19:15.236
- Yes, ma'am.
- Dunham.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.167
Greg wants full custody of Ella.

19:17.673 --> 19:20.301
- What?
- Another process server just came by.

19:20.475 --> 19:22.773
Greg is claiming
that I am an unfit parent.

19:24.746 --> 19:27.772
That the minor's mental and physical
well-being would be best served...

19:27.950 --> 19:30.817
...under the sole custody
of the petitioner.

19:30.986 --> 19:33.284
- He can't be serious.
- I won't let that happen.

19:33.789 --> 19:37.190
I will run if I have to.
I will take her and I will disappear.

19:37.359 --> 19:39.452
- I swear to God.
- Okay, Rachel?

19:39.628 --> 19:40.754
Rachel, just calm down.

19:40.929 --> 19:43.591
You're not running anywhere,
you're not gonna lose Ella.

19:44.099 --> 19:46.829
He's just doing this to hurt me.

19:47.336 --> 19:49.099
Okay, Rachel, listen to me.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.933
This is one of those things
you're gonna look back on...

19:52.107 --> 19:54.007
...you're gonna say, "I beat that too."

19:54.176 --> 19:56.144
Do you hear me?

19:57.679 --> 19:59.544
I hear you.

19:59.715 --> 20:01.148
Okay.

20:01.483 --> 20:04.782
So look, let's talk when I get home.
I've got a...

20:05.888 --> 20:07.685
I gotta go to a meeting.

20:08.190 --> 20:09.851
Okay.

20:13.195 --> 20:15.163
We got that meeting.

20:26.608 --> 20:28.235
Freeze! Federal agents!

20:37.185 --> 20:38.914
- Stay where you are!
- FBI.

20:39.121 --> 20:41.385
Get your ass on the floor!

20:43.625 --> 20:46.492
- Clear?
- Clear.

20:48.063 --> 20:49.087
Valerie Boone.

21:00.175 --> 21:01.836
Your wife isn't there.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.176
I know that.

21:06.048 --> 21:07.640
I need to talk to Agent Dunham.

21:13.288 --> 21:15.756
- Dunham.
- I'm putting him on.

21:19.428 --> 21:21.896
- Agent Dunham.
- What the hell's going on?

21:22.064 --> 21:24.123
There's a room in the back.
Can you see it?

21:24.299 --> 21:26.062
Yeah, we checked. She's not there.

21:26.234 --> 21:28.065
I know, but what I need is.

21:29.171 --> 21:30.763
Okay, I'm here.

21:30.939 --> 21:33.965
In front of you, you should see a row
of refrigeration units.

21:34.176 --> 21:36.474
- Third from the right.
- Yeah, I see it.

21:36.678 --> 21:38.202
Open it.

21:38.380 --> 21:41.281
I'm not gonna do a thing
until you tell me why we're here.

21:41.450 --> 21:43.680
- We're getting to that.
- No, you tell me now.

21:45.087 --> 21:46.486
Inside that cooling unit...

21:46.688 --> 21:52.126
...you'll find a contagion.
Five vials marked XT43.

21:52.294 --> 21:55.491
The person who's out there killing
has been dosed with this.

21:55.697 --> 21:58.325
- I need it to make an antidote.
- You lied to me?

21:58.500 --> 21:59.990
No.

22:00.469 --> 22:05.338
Agent Dunham,
they didn't kidnap my wife...

22:05.607 --> 22:06.835
...they infected her.

22:07.009 --> 22:11.070
That was my punishment
for trying to leave ZFT.

22:12.147 --> 22:14.445
It's she who's out there killing.

22:26.661 --> 22:28.356
Valerie Boone.

22:28.530 --> 22:30.430
Valerie Boone,
you turn March into June.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.759
- Lovely.
- That's enough.

22:31.933 --> 22:33.594
You be on camera. I always do this.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.600
I have no interest in being on camera.

22:35.771 --> 22:36.829
Come on, you.

22:37.005 --> 22:38.495
Okay. Are we both in?
Okay, that's me.

22:38.673 --> 22:40.800
- Hi.
- Hello.

22:40.976 --> 22:42.967
Us in the park.

23:26.421 --> 23:29.185
You are so beautiful.

23:46.108 --> 23:48.668
You are really warm.

23:53.949 --> 23:55.678
You're burning up.

23:59.721 --> 24:01.086
What? What's wrong?

24:02.824 --> 24:05.224
You're my kind of guy.

24:09.131 --> 24:10.325
I'm sorry.

24:28.884 --> 24:32.012
That corner, stop traffic.
Stop the cars coming in.

24:32.187 --> 24:34.747
Keep them on the sidewalk.

24:42.731 --> 24:43.755
Dunham.

24:43.932 --> 24:46.765
Charlie's running a check
on the body found in the Mustang.

24:46.935 --> 24:48.960
Peter said you had something
I should see.

24:49.137 --> 24:50.627
We found this at Boone's house.

24:50.805 --> 24:53.433
You want to pay specific attention
to the date.

25:12.327 --> 25:16.161
Whoever wore a lab coat
and rubber gloves?

25:16.331 --> 25:17.923
Valerie Boone.

25:18.099 --> 25:19.964
Valerie Boone,
you turn March into June.

25:20.135 --> 25:21.261
- Lovely.
- That's enough.

25:21.436 --> 25:23.165
You be on camera. I always do this.

25:23.338 --> 25:25.169
I have no interest in being on camera.

25:25.340 --> 25:26.432
Come on, you.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.769
- Hi.
- Hello.

25:28.977 --> 25:32.344
- Us in the park.
- Okay, look up. Okay.

25:32.547 --> 25:33.980
- Okay.
- There, okay, that's it.

25:34.149 --> 25:37.084
- No, no, no. That's not it.
- I'm running away.

25:37.252 --> 25:38.514
There he goes.

25:39.921 --> 25:43.118
Oh, my God,
you look like you ran in the trash can.

25:49.431 --> 25:52.923
That video was taken three weeks ago,
Dr. Boone.

25:53.101 --> 25:56.628
Can you explain to me
why you're in a wheelchair today?

25:57.973 --> 25:59.941
She needs to feed.

26:00.775 --> 26:03.107
She can't control it.

26:05.213 --> 26:09.013
I began to feed her
my own spinal fluid.

26:10.585 --> 26:15.386
The more I gave,
the more she craved, until...

26:17.025 --> 26:19.289
...I couldn't give any more.

26:22.163 --> 26:25.155
The contagion burns
through her spinal fluid...

26:25.333 --> 26:27.801
...faster than her body can replace it.

26:27.969 --> 26:32.235
When she kills, it's simply...

26:32.407 --> 26:33.499
...to refuel.

26:34.042 --> 26:38.308
I tried to synthesize the antidote
on my own...

26:38.747 --> 26:42.239
...watching her suffer the effects
of being infected...

26:42.417 --> 26:44.385
...but I couldn't do it.

26:44.552 --> 26:48.010
Not without a dose of the bacteria
to work from.

26:50.258 --> 26:54.194
And for the rest of my life, this chair
will remind me of what I've done.

26:54.863 --> 26:58.026
Why would ZFT want you
to create something like this?

27:00.568 --> 27:03.162
To create a human nightmare.

27:03.772 --> 27:06.434
The syphilis was just a platform.

27:07.208 --> 27:10.234
A carrier for other attributes.

27:10.712 --> 27:13.875
- Attributes that changed her.
- For what purpose?

27:14.049 --> 27:20.045
For the same reason they asked me
to create the skin-growth toxin.

27:20.221 --> 27:21.347
To show off.

27:21.523 --> 27:25.050
- To who?
- Other scientists.

27:25.226 --> 27:28.718
- You mean nothing to them.
- So how many vials were created?

27:28.897 --> 27:31.798
- Just the ones that I took?
- I made six, now accounted for.

27:31.966 --> 27:34.560
I can't guarantee
they won't pick up where I left off.

27:34.736 --> 27:36.863
If they did figure out how to make it...

27:37.038 --> 27:39.598
...could they weaponize this bacteria?

27:41.042 --> 27:43.738
You really don't know
who you're dealing with.

27:44.913 --> 27:50.476
The answer for both of us
is to let me make a cure.

27:50.985 --> 27:56.048
Now that you've recovered
the dose samples, I can make it.

27:56.391 --> 27:58.882
My offer still stands.

27:59.060 --> 28:03.156
I'll tell you everything I know
when you find her.

28:03.331 --> 28:05.891
If the cure works, we both win.

28:06.067 --> 28:08.900
Now, I'll need access to a lab
with a blood analyzer.

28:09.070 --> 28:11.971
I'll also need a spectroscope
and a centrifuge.

28:12.140 --> 28:13.971
You might wanna write this down.

28:16.111 --> 28:17.738
That won't be a problem.

28:19.814 --> 28:22.282
Think it's a good idea
to let him have free rein...

28:22.450 --> 28:24.509
...in Walter's
Believe-It-Or-Not emporium?

28:24.719 --> 28:28.655
And this is something my son,
Peter, is working on.

28:28.823 --> 28:31.792
I haven't got the faintest idea
what it is.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.656
Your centrifuge is 20 years old.

28:34.829 --> 28:38.162
Twenty-five. It's an oldie but a goodie.

28:38.333 --> 28:40.631
I also have a cow.

28:40.802 --> 28:43.771
And just for the record,
one mad scientist is my limit.

28:43.938 --> 28:47.635
Think that having him help Walter
is our best chance at saving lives.

28:54.649 --> 28:56.014
- Dunham.
- It's Charlie.

28:56.184 --> 28:57.879
We found Bob Dunn's missing car.

28:58.052 --> 29:00.782
- Where?
- Clear across town in Mission Hill.

29:00.955 --> 29:04.482
It's completely stripped.
Quarter panels, radio, everything.

29:04.659 --> 29:06.354
- And the GPS?
- No, it's gone.

29:06.528 --> 29:09.361
We got no way to track
where he picked up Boone's wife.

29:09.531 --> 29:10.793
Okay, thanks, Charlie.

29:11.633 --> 29:15.194
Good news, Peter. Nicholas and I
are in agreement about this penicillin.

29:15.370 --> 29:17.736
Yes, we need to purify the mold,
then ferment it.

29:17.906 --> 29:20.875
Into the highest
possible concentration.

29:21.376 --> 29:23.537
Agent Farnsworth,
we're going to need a rat.

29:23.711 --> 29:26.236
Can you call me
if something else turns up?

29:26.414 --> 29:28.882
- Okay, bye.
- Great news. They made a breakthrough.

29:29.050 --> 29:32.986
They're gonna fight super-syphilis with
super-penicillin. Syphilis was the platform.

29:33.154 --> 29:35.145
They kill the syphilis,
they stop the contagion.

29:35.323 --> 29:38.019
I did the same thing once
against super-pneumonia.

29:38.193 --> 29:42.186
Right. Well, Charlie just found
Dunn's car stripped in Mission Hill.

29:42.363 --> 29:44.490
- Excellent. He check the GPS?
- Stolen.

29:46.167 --> 29:48.328
Everything stolen
is not necessarily lost.

29:48.837 --> 29:50.532
Meaning what?

29:51.206 --> 29:53.697
If there's a car found
stripped in the Boston area...

29:53.875 --> 29:56.036
...I can guarantee Mako
has his big toe in it.

29:56.211 --> 29:59.112
- You have a friend who runs a chop shop?
- Yeah.

29:59.314 --> 30:01.612
You make that sound so illegal.

30:02.250 --> 30:03.945
Come on, man, just trust me.

30:04.118 --> 30:07.053
She's with me. I'll owe you one, okay?

30:07.222 --> 30:08.746
Dunham.

30:09.891 --> 30:12.359
Let's just say the GPS is here,
allegedly.

30:12.527 --> 30:16.395
But it's useless because it's been
wiped for resale, hypothetically.

30:16.564 --> 30:18.589
We're trying to track a killer,
Mr. Mako.

30:18.766 --> 30:21.462
No, it's just Mako.
You know, like Cher.

30:23.037 --> 30:27.064
Theoretically, if the GPS is wiped, then
that would put you in a rough spot...

30:27.242 --> 30:29.802
...because you'd be hampering
a federal investigation.

30:29.978 --> 30:31.912
- Come on...
- I'm trying to work with you.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.412
We need the GPS
to find out where the victim was.

30:34.582 --> 30:38.416
- But you stole his car from Brookline.
- I didn't steal his car from Brookline.

30:38.586 --> 30:40.577
Where did you steal it from?

30:42.357 --> 30:44.325
If I tell you
where we boosted that car...

30:44.492 --> 30:47.461
...can we just say
that this conversation never happened?

30:47.629 --> 30:49.426
Hypothetically?

30:49.597 --> 30:50.928
Sure.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.465
Route 18 in Weymouth, by the water.

31:01.376 --> 31:03.310
Fascinating.

31:03.945 --> 31:05.674
One hundred and five degrees.

31:05.880 --> 31:08.610
And the rat's successfully infected.

31:08.917 --> 31:13.149
This strain of syphilis raises
a body temperature well above normal.

31:13.688 --> 31:17.021
Now, the cure is nearly complete.

31:18.192 --> 31:22.526
Once this penicillin concentrates,
we can test it on the rat.

31:24.766 --> 31:26.666
Where did you study, Nicholas?

31:26.834 --> 31:29.667
At the Curie Institute, in Paris.

31:29.837 --> 31:32.829
King's College, Aberdeen, Scotland.

31:33.007 --> 31:35.032
It's quite a fall.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.837
It's an honor to have your intellect
in my lab.

31:41.282 --> 31:43.409
That's high praise.

31:44.686 --> 31:46.847
Because I know very well who you are.

31:47.722 --> 31:50.782
Well, that makes one of us.

31:52.026 --> 31:56.963
A little memory loss
is often kind to the soul.

31:58.199 --> 32:03.136
Is that a figure of speech,
or do you believe there is such a thing?

32:03.304 --> 32:04.999
The soul?

32:06.074 --> 32:09.237
There are days when I wish I did.

32:10.244 --> 32:12.235
There are days when I wish I didn't.

32:13.514 --> 32:17.883
I often wake up at night, frightened...

32:18.052 --> 32:23.012
...with the understanding that
there are things man shouldn't know.

32:24.025 --> 32:26.255
That the scientific trespasses
I've committed...

32:26.461 --> 32:27.553
Will one day be judged.

32:30.398 --> 32:32.332
Belly and I...

32:32.834 --> 32:35.735
...would often debate this very thing.

32:36.204 --> 32:37.865
William Bell, you've heard of him?

32:39.507 --> 32:42.908
Of course.
Founder of Massive Dynamic.

32:43.077 --> 32:47.104
- Richest man in the world.
- We used to share a lab.

32:48.616 --> 32:49.674
Quite a fall.

32:53.054 --> 32:54.749
If indeed there is a soul...

32:54.922 --> 33:00.189
...we must consider then
that there is still time for redemption.

33:00.895 --> 33:04.490
We're not being hauled off
to be judged yet, Nicholas.

33:10.204 --> 33:12.468
This must be
where Mako boosted the car.

33:12.640 --> 33:14.870
All this shattered glass.

33:15.543 --> 33:16.908
So we're thinking what?

33:17.078 --> 33:21.071
Boone's wife kills this guy,
steals his car and then drives it out here?

33:21.949 --> 33:24.440
Yeah. But what was she doing here?

33:24.952 --> 33:26.385
And where did she go?

33:31.025 --> 33:33.255
You know what I hate
worse than the cold?

33:33.428 --> 33:36.591
- What?
- Not much.

33:40.902 --> 33:44.736
Olivia, I think I know
why she came out here.

34:11.666 --> 34:13.156
The camera, Astrid.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.563
Okay. Ready.

34:20.440 --> 34:24.377
We are about to inject the infected rat
with an antidote.

34:24.545 --> 34:29.983
Should it prove effective,
it will no doubt work on humans as well.

34:30.752 --> 34:31.911
Nicholas?

34:38.059 --> 34:39.719
Now we wait.

34:42.063 --> 34:46.431
Marvelous. You can bring the bodies
right this way, gentlemen.

34:46.601 --> 34:49.263
We've been expecting you.
Right over here is fine.

34:49.837 --> 34:52.304
May I offer you a Peek Frean?

34:52.806 --> 34:57.335
A delicious vanilla wafer
with raspberry center and lemon cream.

34:57.512 --> 35:00.242
He doesn't want a cookie, Walter.

35:01.482 --> 35:02.949
Apparently you're wrong.

35:03.117 --> 35:04.641
That's two more bodies.

35:05.153 --> 35:07.678
One we found in the forest
in Weymouth...

35:07.855 --> 35:10.187
...the other on a street in Roxbury.

35:10.358 --> 35:14.488
Where is she getting her victims? You
must have some idea where she'd go.

35:14.662 --> 35:17.927
The person out there killing
people is not thinking like my wife.

35:18.432 --> 35:20.798
She wouldn't recognize me...

35:21.469 --> 35:23.869
...let alone find comfort
in places she knows.

35:25.273 --> 35:28.538
This one's been drinking.
He smells like a brewery.

35:35.750 --> 35:38.378
- Hey, Peter, will you turn out the lights?
- Seriously?

35:39.020 --> 35:40.988
It's all right, Peter.

35:45.059 --> 35:46.822
I ordered it on television.

35:49.063 --> 35:50.655
It's an entry stamp.

35:56.270 --> 35:58.830
He's got the same one.
It's a place called the Cavern.

35:59.006 --> 36:02.339
Industrial area is happening
in the underground club scene right now.

36:02.510 --> 36:04.842
So she's going to the club
to find these victims?

36:13.321 --> 36:15.983
Look, I need more time
to make the cure.

36:17.425 --> 36:18.687
Please.

36:18.860 --> 36:22.318
If you take her alive,
I know I can save her.

36:23.197 --> 36:25.392
I'll see what I can do.

36:50.858 --> 36:54.851
Dunham. FBI.
And him too. He's with me.

37:23.891 --> 37:26.792
Now, you're my kind of guy.

37:27.728 --> 37:29.127
What is that?

37:29.297 --> 37:31.891
It's a handheld
thermo-imaging radiometer.

37:34.235 --> 37:35.600
It tells me if you're hot.

37:36.671 --> 37:37.797
So?

37:39.140 --> 37:40.573
Oh, you're definitely hot.

37:41.375 --> 37:43.070
But...

37:43.911 --> 37:45.845
...I'm looking for someone with
syphilis.

37:46.013 --> 37:48.777
Ha-ha. Okay.

37:53.921 --> 37:55.946
I don't understand.
Something's wrong.

37:56.123 --> 37:57.522
Something's missing.

37:59.126 --> 38:02.027
The rat's body has rejected the cure.

38:02.797 --> 38:05.789
- Perhaps a protein incompatibility.
- No, it's not that.

38:05.967 --> 38:06.991
I know what's wrong.

38:07.168 --> 38:10.763
The contagion required
cerebrospinal fluid as a catalyst.

38:10.938 --> 38:13.168
And the cure
must require some as well.

38:13.774 --> 38:15.833
Bond the cure to the contagion.

38:16.010 --> 38:19.810
Yes, and the only spinal fluid we know
for a fact is compatible...

38:19.981 --> 38:21.005
...is my own.

38:21.182 --> 38:23.514
That's out of the question.
It's too dangerous.

38:23.684 --> 38:27.347
If you lose more spinal fluid,
it could cause a brain hemorrhage.

38:27.521 --> 38:30.649
No, I was very careful to monitor
the amount of fluid I removed.

38:30.825 --> 38:32.884
Another 25 milliliters should be safe.

38:33.060 --> 38:35.722
Walter, we can't.

38:35.930 --> 38:38.194
We have no other choice.

38:39.533 --> 38:40.557
Walter.

38:44.638 --> 38:46.503
Prep the table, Agent Farnsworth.

38:48.009 --> 38:49.636
Thank you.

39:01.655 --> 39:03.247
Anything?

39:03.457 --> 39:05.186
No, not yet.

39:24.678 --> 39:28.079
I got her.
She's moving along the back wall.

39:39.493 --> 39:41.393
Peter, I can't find her.

39:47.201 --> 39:49.533
She was right there,
but she's gone now.

39:49.703 --> 39:53.730
Okay. All right, keep looking.
I'm gonna check in with Charlie.

39:56.811 --> 39:58.073
Hey, Charlie?

39:58.245 --> 40:00.713
We had her but we lost her.
You got the exit?

40:00.881 --> 40:04.044
Nobody's leaving yet.
She's still in there with you, Liv.

40:25.473 --> 40:29.569
Would you prepare
this spinal fluid, Agent Farnsworth?

40:31.479 --> 40:33.140
Come on up.

40:33.314 --> 40:34.838
Here we go. Gently.

40:36.250 --> 40:39.117
Gently, gently, gently.

40:42.089 --> 40:44.990
- All right?
- Yes, thanks.

41:12.286 --> 41:13.514
Charlie?

41:14.321 --> 41:16.289
Charlie, I think she's headed to you.

41:16.457 --> 41:18.357
- What's she wearing?
- Black dress.

41:18.526 --> 41:21.461
- Freakishly blue eyes.
- On it.

41:24.832 --> 41:27.733
Valerie Boone? Are you Valerie Boone?

41:27.902 --> 41:29.733
It's her! Take her down!

41:34.241 --> 41:36.175
All right, we got her. Clear the area.

41:36.343 --> 41:38.971
Oh, my God. They just shot that woman.

41:51.892 --> 41:53.985
I just got off the phone with Olivia.

41:54.161 --> 41:56.220
Good news, Dr. Boone. They have her.

41:56.397 --> 41:58.422
Oh, excellent.

41:58.632 --> 41:59.656
Dr. Boone?

42:01.235 --> 42:02.634
Walter.

42:05.039 --> 42:06.370
Get me a TPA injection.

42:07.942 --> 42:10.035
You lied to me.

42:10.211 --> 42:12.179
You let me take too much spinal fluid.

42:14.081 --> 42:17.073
How far would you go...

42:17.251 --> 42:18.718
...for someone you love?

42:28.862 --> 42:30.591
How's she doing?

42:31.165 --> 42:33.565
She's gonna be out for hours.

42:35.236 --> 42:36.897
Where's the siren on this thing?

42:37.871 --> 42:39.429
There.

42:40.407 --> 42:41.965
Is that why you wanted to drive?

42:50.317 --> 42:53.980
Everybody should get to do this
at least once before they die.

43:15.509 --> 43:19.445
That look says more than just,
"I wish I hadn't have let him drive."

43:20.514 --> 43:23.074
I was just thinking about
Nicholas Boone...

43:23.250 --> 43:26.276
...and what he did for his wife,
or what he is doing.

43:26.453 --> 43:27.943
Just that kind of love...

43:30.424 --> 43:32.517
Greg asked Rachel for a divorce...

43:32.693 --> 43:35.321
...and now he's fighting her
for custody.

43:35.896 --> 43:38.990
- I never liked that guy.
- You've never met Greg.

43:39.166 --> 43:41.794
But I met your sister,
so I know she deserves better.

43:41.969 --> 43:44.665
And I thought you were
a card-carrying cynic.

43:44.838 --> 43:47.500
I am. World-class.
But there's an argument to be made...

43:47.675 --> 43:50.337
...that beneath every cynic
is a frustrated romantic.

44:00.654 --> 44:01.712
Peter.

44:01.922 --> 44:03.617
Peter, my tranq gun.

44:18.706 --> 44:20.230
Thank you.

44:25.846 --> 44:27.814
I think she liked you.

44:31.352 --> 44:33.877
Good. Bring her in, strap her down.

44:39.860 --> 44:42.590
- Walter, what happened?
- He had a stroke.

44:43.097 --> 44:45.190
- Pulse is strong.
- Yeah, so is she.

44:45.366 --> 44:50.235
Agent Farnsworth,
30 cc's of the antidote, please.

44:50.404 --> 44:52.099
Peter.

45:16.897 --> 45:19.127
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

45:24.638 --> 45:27.539
- Okay, now what?
- Now we wait.

45:32.713 --> 45:34.374
Walter?

45:34.548 --> 45:36.778
No, let her.

45:53.233 --> 45:55.133
Is she?

46:20.160 --> 46:21.491
Seems to be working.

46:23.263 --> 46:25.322
Agent Farnsworth...

46:25.833 --> 46:28.825
...prepare a solution of 30 parts saline.

46:30.370 --> 46:35.364
And some adrenaline
and perhaps a cup of coffee.

46:36.643 --> 46:38.270
Walter?

46:56.830 --> 46:58.525
He's gone.

47:20.120 --> 47:24.250
Dr. Boone asked me to give this
to you personally, Agent Dunham.

47:24.758 --> 47:26.749
What is it, Walter?

47:48.682 --> 47:50.274
Agent Dunham...

47:50.450 --> 47:55.217
...if you're watching this,
I suspect I didn't make it.

47:55.389 --> 48:00.554
But you and I had a bargain
and you held up your end.

48:01.295 --> 48:03.593
Now, I have made many mistakes
in my life...

48:03.764 --> 48:08.133
...but in the end,
I should at least be a man of my word.

48:08.302 --> 48:11.237
And I promised you answers.

48:11.405 --> 48:16.809
With any luck, you will use them
to rectify some of my misdeeds.

48:16.977 --> 48:20.936
Now, in the time I worked with ZFT...

48:21.114 --> 48:25.608
...I never dealt with anyone
of significant rank within the movement.

48:26.320 --> 48:29.812
But I was able to gather some names.

48:29.990 --> 48:34.393
Including some, I suspect,
you've already heard of.

48:54.948 --> 48:56.245
Dunham.

48:56.750 --> 48:58.240
Hey.

48:58.418 --> 49:00.909
- You all right?
- Yeah.

49:02.289 --> 49:03.688
Uh, Nicholas Boone talked.

49:03.857 --> 49:06.087
He told us everything he knew
about ZFT.

49:06.259 --> 49:08.022
Did he mention David Robert Jones?

49:08.228 --> 49:10.253
No. He said he'd never heard of him.

49:10.430 --> 49:14.264
But he did mention another name
that we've heard before.

49:15.168 --> 49:19.298
According to Boone,
the man who's funding ZFT...

49:20.507 --> 49:21.940
...is William Bell.
