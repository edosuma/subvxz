[instrumental music]

00:20.977 --> 00:23.893
[dramatic music]

00:30.465 --> 00:32.206
Rosemary, please don't go.
I'm only trying to help.

00:32.293 --> 00:33.555
I'm not
listening to you--

00:33.642 --> 00:35.165
Rosemary, you're in
serious danger.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.037
I'm not listening.

00:38.603 --> 00:41.476
[music continues]

00:43.521 --> 00:44.696
[cellphone ringing]

00:59.711 --> 01:01.626
[panting]

01:01.713 --> 01:03.150
No!

[music continues]

01:26.782 --> 01:28.653
[indistinct radio chattering]

01:28.740 --> 01:30.481
[male #1]
'Thank you for
coming so quickly.'

01:30.568 --> 01:33.310
[Teresa]
'Your victim is the widow
of Macon Tennant.'

01:33.397 --> 01:35.443
Founder of
Calsure Financial..

01:35.530 --> 01:37.271
Close friend to
lieutenant governor.

01:37.358 --> 01:38.794
We got to use
the chopper.

01:38.881 --> 01:40.709
Cool.
Now, we have two witnesses

01:40.796 --> 01:43.886
'who saw a silver sedan
deliberately chase her down.'

01:43.973 --> 01:45.453
Uh, we're getting paint
off of the trash cans right now.

01:45.540 --> 01:46.845
Hopefully we'll get
a make and model.

01:46.932 --> 01:48.760
Uh, we've also got
a partial plate.

01:48.847 --> 01:50.240
Sounds like
you're on top of it.

01:50.327 --> 01:52.503
Sure, but I don't mind
getting your backup.

01:52.590 --> 01:54.592
We're not backup.
We're lead.

01:54.679 --> 01:57.029
Yes, ma'am.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.554
Few days ago, Rosemary here
filed a missing persons report

01:59.641 --> 02:01.208
'on her teenage son, Travis.'

02:01.295 --> 02:02.513
He had been gone
for a week

02:02.600 --> 02:04.080
but he's run away
from home twice

02:04.167 --> 02:05.429
and he's done a stint
in juvie, so..

02:05.516 --> 02:06.474
What was the juvie charge?

02:06.561 --> 02:09.303
DUI, on a learner's permit.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.782
Her house is
eight blocks that way

02:10.869 --> 02:12.088
'so we figured that
she was walking home'

02:12.175 --> 02:13.959
'but from where,
we're not sure.'

02:14.046 --> 02:17.920
- She was with me.
- And who are you exactly?

02:18.007 --> 02:19.487
My name is Kristina Frye.

02:19.574 --> 02:22.229
I was Rosemary's
spiritual advisor.

02:22.316 --> 02:23.926
I'm sorry.
Did I hear that correctly?

02:24.013 --> 02:25.754
Miss Frye, you were
with here where?

02:25.841 --> 02:27.930
At my house.

02:28.017 --> 02:31.455
We'd finished a session.
We had contacted her husband.

02:31.542 --> 02:33.718
- Her dead husband?
- Mmm.

02:33.805 --> 02:36.199
He knew this was gonna
happen to her.

02:36.286 --> 02:37.853
He warned her that she
was putting herself

02:37.940 --> 02:38.984
in terrible danger.

02:39.071 --> 02:40.986
- From whom?
- I don't know.

02:41.073 --> 02:42.771
I'm merely a channel.

02:42.858 --> 02:44.642
A-a channel for what?

02:44.729 --> 02:46.775
For the energy
of the departed souls.

02:48.907 --> 02:52.520
Okay. Oh, so you knew that
this murder was gonna happen?

02:52.607 --> 02:54.261
[Kristina]
'I didn't know.
Her husband knew.'

02:54.348 --> 02:56.785
I just passed the warning
along to Rosemary.

02:56.872 --> 02:59.222
Okay, got it, uh,
by her own admission

02:59.309 --> 03:01.006
she's either, uh, a channel

03:01.093 --> 03:03.270
for the energy
of the departed souls

03:03.357 --> 03:05.533
or she's involved
in this murder.

03:05.620 --> 03:06.577
So you got a choice.

03:06.664 --> 03:07.883
You can call Ghostbusters

03:07.970 --> 03:09.841
or we can take
this lady downtown.

03:09.928 --> 03:11.756
Miss Frye, would you mind
coming into our office

03:11.843 --> 03:14.368
in the morning and answering
a few more questions in detail?

03:14.455 --> 03:17.109
If I could be of any help,
I'd be glad to.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.676
Please call me Kristina.

03:20.156 --> 03:21.766
[laughing]

03:21.853 --> 03:23.420
Where's all this anger
I feel coming from?

03:23.507 --> 03:25.466
Not from me.
Maybe you're projecting.

03:25.553 --> 03:27.598
No.
Rosemary was my friend.

03:27.685 --> 03:31.341
Am I sad? Of course.
Am I angry?

03:31.428 --> 03:34.126
Only that somebody would do
such a terrible thing to her.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.563
Don't take this
the wrong way

03:35.650 --> 03:38.827
but you are completely
misreading the situation.

03:38.914 --> 03:41.438
I am, am I?

03:41.525 --> 03:42.961
Oh, this is gonna be good.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.445
[theme music]

03:55.713 --> 03:56.888
How long have you
known Rosemary Tennant?

03:56.975 --> 03:58.194
Almost three years.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.500
Do you charge
for your services?

03:59.587 --> 04:02.590
Yes. How much depends
on the resources

04:02.677 --> 04:05.027
of the individual client,
but I never turn anyone away.

04:05.114 --> 04:06.550
How much did you
charge Rosemary?

04:06.637 --> 04:07.899
Five hundred dollars per hour.

04:07.986 --> 04:10.206
- How many hours a week?
- 'Five to six.'

04:10.293 --> 04:13.818
Oh..
Three grand a week. Nice.

04:13.905 --> 04:16.256
Rosemary was
a troubled soul.

04:16.343 --> 04:18.083
She needed intensive help.

04:18.170 --> 04:21.130
What was troubling her?

04:21.217 --> 04:23.219
Her husband was
a powerful anchor in her life.

04:23.306 --> 04:27.267
After his death, I think
she felt adrift, vulnerable.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.094
People that she shouldn't
have trusted recognized

04:29.181 --> 04:30.487
her weaknesses
and played on them.

04:30.574 --> 04:31.532
Oh, really?

04:31.619 --> 04:33.708
Any people in particular?

04:33.795 --> 04:35.797
Too many to mention.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.581
As a result I think
her relationship

04:37.668 --> 04:38.756
with her children
may have suffered.

04:38.843 --> 04:40.454
That would be Clara
and Travis, yes?

04:40.541 --> 04:42.630
- Mm-hmm.
- Suffered how?

04:44.545 --> 04:46.155
I'm sorry,
I'm not comfortable

04:46.242 --> 04:48.200
sharing any more
than that with you.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.681
Travis went missing
several days ago.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.248
What did she have
to say about that?

04:52.335 --> 04:55.164
Truly, I'd love to help you,
but my practice is bound

04:55.251 --> 04:57.427
by the same client
confidentiality codes

04:57.514 --> 04:58.994
that all doctors abide by.

04:59.081 --> 05:00.996
You have a professional
therapist's license?

05:01.083 --> 05:03.172
- Yes, I do.
- Your client's dead.

05:03.259 --> 05:05.130
Her earthly vessel is dead.

05:05.217 --> 05:08.046
When her soul completes
its journey, I could ask her

05:08.133 --> 05:09.526
if it's alright
to share her problems

05:09.613 --> 05:11.615
with you in more detail.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.487
'I recorded all
of our sessions on CD.'

05:13.574 --> 05:16.359
If she says yes,
I'll give them to you.

05:16.446 --> 05:19.014
Why bother with that? Why not
just ask her who killed her?

05:19.101 --> 05:22.496
Of course, I will,
but she may not know.

05:22.583 --> 05:25.107
Death doesn't
grant omniscience.

05:25.194 --> 05:26.500
You're good.

05:26.587 --> 05:28.415
- I like to think so.
- Yes, you do.

05:28.502 --> 05:30.286
I think it's important
to love one's self.

05:30.373 --> 05:31.287
How do you feel
about yourself?

05:31.374 --> 05:34.072
Oh. You tell me.

05:34.159 --> 05:35.596
And forget about
the $500 an hour.

05:35.683 --> 05:36.901
I'm on civil service pay.

05:36.988 --> 05:39.861
Okay, for free then.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.341
[clearing throat]

05:41.428 --> 05:44.039
I think you act assured
and arrogant

05:44.126 --> 05:45.780
but inside
you are troubled

05:45.867 --> 05:48.478
with deep guilt
and self-loathing.

05:48.565 --> 05:52.264
A recent trauma
in your past perhaps?

05:52.352 --> 05:55.398
But you're more
than a little unstable.

05:55.485 --> 05:58.358
You have your work
cut out for you.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.795
- You are good.
- Please.

06:00.882 --> 06:04.712
Not to boast but I am quite
a well-known horrible tragedy.

06:04.799 --> 06:06.453
A mere half-hour
on the internet

06:06.540 --> 06:08.716
would tell you that I'm consumed
with guilt and self-loathing.

06:08.803 --> 06:11.414
One look in your eyes
would tell me that.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.416
And what makes you think
I would spend any time

06:13.503 --> 06:15.418
researching you
on the internet?

06:15.505 --> 06:16.811
A little self-involved maybe?

06:19.204 --> 06:20.336
May I go?

06:20.423 --> 06:21.990
Yes. Thank you
for your time.

06:22.077 --> 06:24.732
Feel free to call me,
any time.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.168
We will.

06:31.608 --> 06:32.522
What?

06:39.790 --> 06:40.965
Do we know who's home?

06:41.052 --> 06:42.271
Until two days ago
the residents

06:42.358 --> 06:44.969
were Travis Tennant,
Rosemary Tennant

06:45.056 --> 06:46.188
and a semi-permanent houseguest

06:46.275 --> 06:47.885
name of Jeremy Hale.

06:47.972 --> 06:51.802
Portrait photographer
and Mrs. Tennant's boyfriend

06:51.889 --> 06:53.891
according to the gardener
and pool guy.

06:55.893 --> 06:58.156
Dooley.
Dooley, come here.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.244
Can I help you?

06:59.331 --> 07:00.681
- Mr. Hale?
- Yes.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.422
California Bureau Investigation.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.685
You mind if we come in?

07:04.772 --> 07:06.469
No, not at all.

07:11.518 --> 07:14.651
Uh, sorry...about the mess.

07:14.738 --> 07:16.566
Looks like you weren't
alone last night.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.438
Well, I was at a, uh,
gallery opening

07:18.525 --> 07:20.614
but someone's always here.

07:20.701 --> 07:22.267
Rosie liked to
have people around

07:22.354 --> 07:25.009
and...well, you know
us creative types

07:25.096 --> 07:27.925
any chance to, uh,
put off work.

07:28.012 --> 07:29.274
How long have you lived here?

07:29.361 --> 07:31.668
Uh..

07:31.755 --> 07:34.410
...going on six months.

07:34.497 --> 07:37.587
I'm a, uh, a photographer

07:37.674 --> 07:40.503
'and I met Rosemary
at a show.'

07:40.590 --> 07:41.896
I came to do a portrait

07:41.983 --> 07:44.594
and then I guess
we just kinda gelled

07:44.681 --> 07:46.161
'and I never left.'

07:46.248 --> 07:48.380
So you and Mrs. Tennant
were lovers?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.687
That's what everyone says.

07:50.774 --> 07:52.689
Did I love her
and vice versa, yes.

07:52.776 --> 07:55.431
But lovers?
We were close.

07:55.518 --> 07:58.086
She understood me
better than anyone.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.174
Living here you
must have gotten

07:59.261 --> 08:01.219
to know her kids
pretty well.

08:01.306 --> 08:04.179
Clara's all grown up.
Didn't come around much anymore.

08:04.266 --> 08:05.702
'And Travis, that kid
has some problems.'

08:05.789 --> 08:07.356
[Teresa]
'How so?'

08:07.443 --> 08:11.055
I think after his dad died,
he just...lost it

08:11.142 --> 08:15.059
on drugs, stealing stuff,
acting out in crazy ways.

08:15.146 --> 08:16.887
When was the last time
you saw him?

08:16.974 --> 08:18.323
Over a week ago.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.021
Rosie found drugs
in his bedroom.

08:20.108 --> 08:22.110
They had a big fight.
He split. I don't know where.

08:22.197 --> 08:24.155
He's got a hundred crazy
friends to hide out with.

08:24.242 --> 08:25.896
Excuse me. Uh, do you mind
if I take a look around?

08:25.983 --> 08:28.377
No. Go for it.

08:28.464 --> 08:30.597
Thank you.

08:30.684 --> 08:33.687
Rosemary put you in her will
a few months back, didn't she?

08:33.774 --> 08:36.385
Yeah, and I felt bad about that,
actually. It's too much.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.605
'But Rosemary was
such a generous person'

08:38.692 --> 08:40.737
and to refuse her generosity

08:40.824 --> 08:43.348
would be to, you know
deny her essence.

08:43.435 --> 08:45.263
The day before she died
she made an appointment

08:45.350 --> 08:47.178
with her estate lawyer,
told him she wanted to make

08:47.265 --> 08:49.267
further alterations
to the trust.

08:49.354 --> 08:51.182
Really? I had no idea.

08:51.269 --> 08:52.967
What do you think
that was about?

08:53.054 --> 08:55.404
I could only imagine
it has to do with Travis.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.928
Cut him off, and maybe
it would straighten him out.

08:58.015 --> 09:00.452
[Jane]
'Lisbon!'

09:00.540 --> 09:01.802
Thank you.

09:05.283 --> 09:07.634
Oh, you found my studio.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.679
She was quite beautiful,
wasn't she?

09:09.766 --> 09:11.551
You really captured
so much in her eyes.

09:11.638 --> 09:12.856
It's like
she's talking to us.

09:12.943 --> 09:14.510
Rosemary was an easy subject

09:14.597 --> 09:16.120
and those photos still
don't do her justice.

09:16.207 --> 09:18.819
This is quite a setup.

09:18.906 --> 09:21.169
Darkroom,
state-of-the-art equipment.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.127
It's nice to have
a benefactor.

09:23.214 --> 09:26.043
- I'm blessed.
- Or clever.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.611
You say that Travis left because
he and his mom had a fight.

09:28.698 --> 09:29.656
Are you sure about that?

09:29.743 --> 09:31.048
Well, of course.
I was there.

09:31.135 --> 09:33.790
I think Mrs. Tennant
turns a blind eye

09:33.877 --> 09:36.619
towards her son's problems
because he lost his dad.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.926
He didn't leave because of her.
He left because of you.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.318
What are you talking about?

09:40.405 --> 09:43.626
I thinkthiswas Travis' room.

09:43.713 --> 09:46.542
There's old poster tape
here on the walls

09:46.629 --> 09:49.284
there's stickers
behind this door

09:49.371 --> 09:52.287
and...dents

09:52.374 --> 09:55.682
up here, from where
a lacrosse ball was hitting it.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.292
Travis plays lacrosse,
doesn't he?

09:57.379 --> 09:59.424
He used to
before he got into drugs.

09:59.511 --> 10:02.036
And here, this pane of glass
has a crack in it

10:02.123 --> 10:05.126
right at elbow or fist height.

10:05.213 --> 10:07.302
Must have been quite
the argument between you two.

10:07.389 --> 10:08.825
Okay, that's enough.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.435
The only question is
did you take his room

10:10.522 --> 10:11.959
as soon as he left

10:12.046 --> 10:13.874
or did he leave
because you took his room?

10:13.961 --> 10:18.618
You're in my personal space.
Please step back.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.576
Excuse me.

10:20.663 --> 10:24.014
So you kick him out of here,
he has to find someplace safe

10:24.101 --> 10:27.061
someplace to hide
where change can't find him.

10:27.148 --> 10:28.062
So where'd he go?

10:33.197 --> 10:36.070
[instrumental music]

10:47.951 --> 10:49.997
[footsteps approaching]

10:50.084 --> 10:51.825
[Jeremy]
'Yeah, it's here
on the right.'

10:51.912 --> 10:53.827
'He was happier
in a smaller room.'

10:53.914 --> 10:55.567
Yeah, I bet.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.265
Excuse me, but there's a
definite note of uncalled for

10:57.352 --> 10:59.354
'hostility in your voice.
What-what is that about?'

10:59.441 --> 11:00.921
He's just trying
to do his job.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.925
I know Travis Tennant
is suspect number one

11:05.012 --> 11:08.537
but Jeremy isn't exactly
grieving right now.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.582
I'll do some digging on Hale,
and see what I come up with.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.193
[Teresa]
'Who's to say
the kid's not dead?'

11:12.280 --> 11:14.282
'Maybe he killed
both of them.'

11:14.369 --> 11:16.501
More money
in the will for him.

11:16.588 --> 11:19.243
- Anything on the business side?
- Well, the psychic was right.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.811
Every high-end con artist
and social parasite in town

11:21.898 --> 11:23.813
was hittin' Rosemary
up for a million.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.511
These guys are all white-collar
leeches, not murderers.

11:26.598 --> 11:29.297
- This looks like her.
- The daughter.

11:29.384 --> 11:32.213
Miss Tennant, I'm Agent Lisbon.
Thank you for coming.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.824
I came as soon as I could.

11:34.911 --> 11:37.044
Uh, has anyone
found my brother?

11:37.131 --> 11:38.393
Please have a seat.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.876
We're so sorry
for your loss.

11:42.963 --> 11:46.531
To answer your question,
No, Travis is still missing.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.969
But we're doing everything
we can to find him.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.842
Can you tell us
about your mother?

11:52.929 --> 11:55.018
Anything might help.

11:55.105 --> 11:56.890
I just can't
believe she's gone.

11:59.022 --> 12:02.199
I mean, she was such
a good person.

12:02.286 --> 12:04.985
Everybody loves her, and..

12:05.072 --> 12:06.987
For her to die in the gutter
like that, it's..

12:09.598 --> 12:11.861
...like garbage,
it's-it's horrible.

12:11.948 --> 12:15.125
People say she changed
after your father died.

12:15.212 --> 12:17.127
She..

12:17.214 --> 12:19.347
She sort of lost control.

12:19.434 --> 12:22.742
And my father was..

12:22.829 --> 12:24.918
...the one that
kept it all going.

12:25.005 --> 12:27.224
And she just..

12:27.311 --> 12:28.443
She wasn't that person.

12:28.530 --> 12:30.401
Could you give us an example?

12:33.143 --> 12:36.277
When I was in college

12:36.364 --> 12:38.670
my brother called
to tell me that..

12:38.758 --> 12:40.281
...people were
ripping us off.

12:40.368 --> 12:44.720
And, uh, mom would invest
in one bad scheme after another

12:44.807 --> 12:48.289
and I tried to warn her,
but she just wouldn't listen.

12:48.376 --> 12:51.466
I'm sure she thought she
was doing the right thing.

12:51.553 --> 12:54.599
Is that when your brother
started acting out?

12:54.686 --> 12:58.212
[Clara]
'He missed dad a lot.'

12:58.299 --> 13:01.215
And suddenly..

13:01.302 --> 13:03.565
...he was the man
of the house.

13:03.652 --> 13:06.350
And I think he just
wasn't used to it.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.659
That's when Jeremy moved in.

13:12.008 --> 13:14.750
And he's scary.
He's very dangerous.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.491
Dangerous how?

13:16.578 --> 13:20.147
He wants what he wants,
and he has a very bad temper.

13:20.234 --> 13:21.888
I was worried for my mom.

13:24.238 --> 13:26.806
Clara, where do you
think Travis is?

13:26.893 --> 13:29.547
If I knew,
I would be with him.

13:31.419 --> 13:34.030
I mean, he's my brother.
He's..

13:34.117 --> 13:36.076
He's all I've got left.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.949
Could you put his number
in there, please?

13:40.036 --> 13:41.603
Well, he's not
gonna call you back.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.170
Yeah, just put it in.

13:47.957 --> 13:48.958
Thank you.

13:57.532 --> 13:59.099
Hello, Travis.

13:59.186 --> 14:01.449
You don't know me,
but my name is Patrick Jane.

14:01.536 --> 14:03.103
I'm a friend.

14:03.190 --> 14:04.669
I know you're in a little
trouble right now

14:04.756 --> 14:07.107
and I want to offer you
some peace of mind.

14:07.194 --> 14:09.674
But I don't know what
peace of mind means to you.

14:09.761 --> 14:11.024
It's different for everyone.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.895
For instance,
I like riding horses.

14:12.982 --> 14:16.029
But would horses make
you happy? I don't know.

14:16.116 --> 14:18.074
Why wouldn't horses
make you happy?

14:18.161 --> 14:21.904
Go round and round in your
mind until you're sure

14:21.991 --> 14:25.038
and go to that place
where you know you are happy.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.214
Then give me a call.
You have my number.

14:29.085 --> 14:31.740
What was that about?

14:31.827 --> 14:32.959
Quick. What image just
came into your head?

14:35.135 --> 14:36.701
[Rigsby]
'All I'm saying, you can't
say there's no such thing'

14:36.788 --> 14:38.834
as psychics just 'cause
you've never met one.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.488
You're right.
I've never seen a zebra.

14:40.575 --> 14:42.794
- Doesn't mean they don't exist.
- You've never seen a zebra?

14:42.882 --> 14:44.579
- No.
- You've never been to a zoo?

14:44.666 --> 14:45.797
You know, I don't get zoos.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.234
You pay money
to look at animals. Why?

14:51.064 --> 14:52.369
Guys.

14:52.456 --> 14:54.850
[Jane]
'That's him.'

14:54.937 --> 14:56.808
Jane, I'll never
doubt you again.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.332
You ever doubted me?

15:02.162 --> 15:04.338
[instrumental music]

15:07.950 --> 15:09.734
[indistinct chattering]

15:15.827 --> 15:17.525
[bell ringing]

15:23.574 --> 15:26.447
[music continues]

15:33.584 --> 15:35.804
Travis, wait.

15:35.891 --> 15:36.936
Just wait.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.818
Travis, we know
why you took off.

15:49.905 --> 15:52.255
We know about
your fight with Jeremy.

15:52.342 --> 15:54.431
Why didn't you call somebody?
Why just run?

15:54.518 --> 15:57.695
'Cause there wasn't
anything they could do.

15:57.782 --> 15:59.697
I don't wanna cause
any more trouble.

15:59.784 --> 16:02.613
[Teresa]
'Cause any trouble for who?
They're your family.'

16:02.700 --> 16:04.746
You really don't understand.

16:06.574 --> 16:09.664
Look, I loved my mom..

16:09.751 --> 16:11.013
...so much.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.623
But after the blowout
with Jeremy

16:12.710 --> 16:14.277
I couldn't go back there.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.845
There was no way.

16:16.932 --> 16:20.153
- When can I see him?
- Oh, soon.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.502
[Teresa]
'So where'd you go?'

16:21.589 --> 16:23.460
Friends' houses mostly.

16:23.547 --> 16:24.984
We'll need names
and addresses.

16:27.116 --> 16:30.337
You know, maybe if I had
been home that night

16:30.424 --> 16:31.338
she'd still be alive.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.035
I..

16:33.122 --> 16:35.255
- Maybe--
- Here's the truth, Travis.

16:35.342 --> 16:38.388
After your dad died, your mom
gave away a lot of your money.

16:38.475 --> 16:39.911
Then she moved Jeremy
into the house

16:39.999 --> 16:41.739
and made your life miserable.

16:41.826 --> 16:44.742
So even though you took off,
you knew where she'd be.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.701
You knew how
she'd walk home.

16:46.788 --> 16:48.572
Are you saying I did this?

16:52.315 --> 16:55.231
When my dad died,
mom was all I had.

16:55.318 --> 16:58.452
You don't think I wanted
to be there for her?

16:58.539 --> 17:00.410
That dirt-bag Jeremy moves in.

17:00.497 --> 17:01.585
He starts telling me what to do

17:01.672 --> 17:04.023
and bossing me around.

17:04.110 --> 17:07.156
She was my mom.
I didn't kill her.

17:09.332 --> 17:10.812
I believe him.

17:13.684 --> 17:14.859
Come here.

17:22.389 --> 17:24.434
We'll be alright.

17:24.521 --> 17:26.001
We'll be fine.

17:27.611 --> 17:30.484
[slow instrumental music]

17:36.316 --> 17:38.100
- Travis is hurting.
- Or he's lying.

17:38.187 --> 17:39.928
Let's not forget
Jeremy Hale stood to

17:40.015 --> 17:41.756
inherit a few
million himself.

17:41.843 --> 17:44.019
'So, maybe he wanted
to speed up the process.'

17:44.106 --> 17:46.152
Finance a nice
long photo shoot

17:46.239 --> 17:48.632
in South America,
lay low for a while?

17:48.719 --> 17:51.200
I heard from
Rosemary's probate lawyer.

17:51.287 --> 17:53.115
Guess who she just
added to her will.

17:53.202 --> 17:54.682
Uh, Kristina Frye?

17:54.769 --> 17:56.292
Ink wasn't even dry yet.

17:56.379 --> 17:57.902
Kristina told us
she knew in advance

17:57.989 --> 17:59.600
that Rosemary
was in danger.

17:59.687 --> 18:01.254
Why would she tell us
that if she's guilty?

18:01.341 --> 18:03.604
How diabolically
clever of her?

18:03.691 --> 18:06.172
Make us dismiss
her as a suspect

18:06.259 --> 18:07.956
because she made
herself look like one.

18:08.043 --> 18:11.438
Or, maybe, just maybe, she has
a rare and precious gift

18:11.525 --> 18:13.222
'and is trying to help us.'

18:13.309 --> 18:15.572
A rare and precious gift.

18:15.659 --> 18:17.748
Tell me.

18:17.835 --> 18:19.576
Who gets these gifts anyhow?

18:19.663 --> 18:21.100
And how come no one
ever has the gift

18:21.187 --> 18:22.927
for seeing horse race results?

18:23.014 --> 18:25.321
And how come dead people
always talk such tedious drivel?

18:25.408 --> 18:28.107
Play nice. Van Pelt's
entitled to her opinion.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.021
Not if it's wrong. This is like
believing in the Easter bunny.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.762
Who says there's
no Easter bunny?

18:31.849 --> 18:34.374
[telephone ringing]

18:34.461 --> 18:36.158
Van Pelt.

18:36.245 --> 18:37.551
Oh, hi.

18:37.638 --> 18:40.162
'Wow. Thanks.'

18:40.249 --> 18:42.817
Got it.
We'll be right over.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.210
That was Kristina.

18:44.297 --> 18:45.646
She said she's picking
up on something.

18:45.733 --> 18:48.649
- Ooh.
- Something that might help us.

18:48.736 --> 18:50.738
Why don't you go talk to her?

18:50.825 --> 18:53.480
- I'm coming.
- Does he have to?

18:53.567 --> 18:55.177
If she's conning us,
we need to know.

18:55.264 --> 18:57.875
She isn't.
I can tell.

18:57.962 --> 18:59.442
[Teresa]
'Behave.'

19:00.226 --> 19:01.923
[knock on door]

19:02.010 --> 19:03.751
Miss Frye?

19:03.838 --> 19:05.709
[Kristina]
'Be right there.
Take a seat, please.'

19:05.796 --> 19:07.407
Madame Zoltar
welcomes you.

19:13.064 --> 19:14.849
[sniffing]

19:15.937 --> 19:18.940
Hm. I smell dead people.

19:19.027 --> 19:20.420
Jane, sshh.

19:22.248 --> 19:25.164
[dramatic music]

19:33.084 --> 19:34.999
[Jane]
'Look, you can do all your
holiday shopping right here.'

19:35.086 --> 19:36.044
Aren't you the least
bit interested

19:36.131 --> 19:37.263
in what she has to say?

19:37.350 --> 19:39.569
No. I love the mirror, though.

19:39.656 --> 19:41.180
Conveniently located,
isn't it?

19:41.267 --> 19:43.225
What do you mean?

19:43.312 --> 19:45.793
It's one way glass.
Textbook clairvoyant trick.

19:45.880 --> 19:49.188
She studies her client's body
language before they come in.

19:55.585 --> 19:57.500
Come on. She's probably
watching us right now.

19:57.587 --> 20:00.329
- You can't go in there.
- Sure, I can.

20:00.416 --> 20:01.765
Jane.

20:05.116 --> 20:06.988
See? No one way glass.

20:07.075 --> 20:08.468
Oh, maybe in this instance

20:08.555 --> 20:09.991
but not as a general
observation.

20:10.078 --> 20:11.340
Shall we sit down?

20:16.476 --> 20:17.433
Sure.

20:19.435 --> 20:20.784
You know what
I'm struggling with?

20:20.871 --> 20:23.091
Enlighten me.

20:23.178 --> 20:24.962
You talk such
a good high-class game

20:25.049 --> 20:28.618
but your temple
looks like a discount

20:28.705 --> 20:31.404
souvenir store
in Shangri-La.

20:31.491 --> 20:33.493
Certain imagery goes
with the territory.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.190
You know that.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.671
People expect
a little razzmatazz

20:37.758 --> 20:40.630
like the shiny suits
you used to wear.

20:40.717 --> 20:42.937
He says..

20:43.024 --> 20:46.897
"I'm sorry for all the pain
I caused you and your mother."

20:46.984 --> 20:48.725
They're tears of joy.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.510
So you have done some
research on me?

20:50.597 --> 20:52.816
I have now. Red John
murdered your family.

20:52.903 --> 20:54.992
I'm very sorry for your loss.

20:55.079 --> 20:56.385
Is that why you gave
up your calling?

20:56.472 --> 20:59.083
Calling?
Is that what this is?

20:59.170 --> 21:01.651
Yeah, calling,
gift, as you like.

21:01.738 --> 21:03.174
There's no doubt you had that.
Why'd you give it up?

21:03.262 --> 21:06.047
It was the suits.
Chafing. Horrible.

21:06.134 --> 21:07.918
Always dancing.
Why is that?

21:08.005 --> 21:10.530
- Don't try to cold read me.
- Oh, I wouldn't know how.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.532
We both know that's a lie.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.708
Can we, um,
talk about the case?

21:16.623 --> 21:18.755
- Yes.
- Please.

21:18.842 --> 21:21.671
So has Rosemary
contacted you yet?

21:21.758 --> 21:24.370
No, not yet.

21:24.457 --> 21:25.675
It often takes some time

21:25.762 --> 21:28.199
for souls to make
a full transit.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.724
Yes, the celestial bus
is running late.

21:30.811 --> 21:32.595
I called to offer
you my assistance.

21:32.682 --> 21:33.727
Clearly you're not interested.

21:33.814 --> 21:37.121
Wait.
I'm the agent here.

21:37.208 --> 21:39.385
We are interested.

21:39.472 --> 21:41.865
I had a vision about the car
used to kill Rosemary.

21:41.952 --> 21:43.171
[clearing throat]

21:45.956 --> 21:47.349
Water rushing
into the windows

21:47.436 --> 21:50.091
tires underwater,
resting on concrete.

21:50.178 --> 21:52.789
Concrete?
Like a swimming pool?

21:52.876 --> 21:55.618
Um, bigger.

21:55.705 --> 21:57.272
A reservoir maybe.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.230
There's Founders Lake
just outside of town.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.929
Yes, a reservoir.

22:04.584 --> 22:07.456
[dramatic music]

22:15.029 --> 22:17.031
Pull.

22:28.782 --> 22:29.739
Thanks.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.743
The damage to the front
end is consistent

22:33.830 --> 22:35.484
with a vehicle versus
pedestrian collision.

22:35.571 --> 22:37.225
But get this,
the VIN Number matches

22:37.312 --> 22:38.748
Rosemary Tennant's
own registration.

22:38.835 --> 22:39.793
That's her car?

22:39.880 --> 22:41.272
Yeah, two moving violations show

22:41.360 --> 22:42.926
that Travis used
the vehicle all the time.

22:43.013 --> 22:45.102
It could have been Jeremy.
He had access to it as well.

22:45.189 --> 22:47.627
Uh, put one of them
in the car that night

22:47.714 --> 22:49.672
traffic cameras,
witnesses at gas stations.

22:49.759 --> 22:50.978
If it exists,
I want to know.

22:51.065 --> 22:52.283
I'm on it.

22:54.024 --> 22:55.243
Are you guys gonna
arrest Travis Tennant

22:55.330 --> 22:56.723
or, uh, you want us to?

22:56.810 --> 22:58.638
I'm sorry, detective
but everything we have

22:58.725 --> 23:00.335
right now is circumstantial.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.642
Well, I go with my gut,
uh, 90% of the time.

23:02.729 --> 23:05.166
If it feels right,
it's meant to be.

23:05.253 --> 23:06.602
What about
the other 10 percent?

23:06.689 --> 23:07.951
Hmm.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.827
If anyone needs arresting,
it's Kristina Frye.

23:13.914 --> 23:16.003
She knew that Rosemary
was in danger.

23:16.090 --> 23:19.398
She knew where to find
the car, the murder weapon

23:19.485 --> 23:22.183
which means that she either
does have supernatural powers

23:22.270 --> 23:23.880
or she was involved
in the crime.

23:23.967 --> 23:27.362
Come on. She simply did
what you do so well.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.712
With an air of confidence,
she made an educated guess.

23:29.799 --> 23:31.932
Where else would you
dump a car around here?

23:32.019 --> 23:34.064
She's a good guesser.

23:34.151 --> 23:36.763
Well, I guess,
that's a possibility, too.

23:38.286 --> 23:40.680
Yes, and that's what
you object to, isn't it?

23:40.767 --> 23:43.900
Not that she's a con artist
but that she's so good at it.

23:43.987 --> 23:45.206
Maybe even better than you.

23:45.293 --> 23:47.687
Not at all. I..

23:47.774 --> 23:50.472
Alright, yes.

23:50.559 --> 23:53.693
Not better than me,
mind you, but she's good.

23:53.780 --> 23:57.436
And it's the good ones
that are the most dangerous.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.960
Excuse me, but you might
consider the possibility

24:00.047 --> 24:01.918
that she's actually
honestly in touch

24:02.005 --> 24:03.442
with something
beyond your understanding.

24:03.529 --> 24:05.792
That would be golf
and musical theater

24:05.879 --> 24:07.750
of the '30s and '40s.

24:07.837 --> 24:10.884
The car is empty except
for these in the trunk.

24:10.971 --> 24:12.189
High-grade coated nylon.

24:12.276 --> 24:14.453
Just like they use
in a photo lab.

24:18.021 --> 24:19.675
Jeremy's gone.

24:19.762 --> 24:22.330
We had an exchange,
and I told him not to come back

24:22.417 --> 24:24.419
'and some of mom's
jewelry is missing.'

24:24.506 --> 24:25.942
You really think he did it?

24:26.029 --> 24:28.554
Someone stole your mom's car
and used it to kill her.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.425
But the locks weren't jimmied.
They had a key.

24:30.512 --> 24:33.646
And you think I did it.
I already told you were I was.

24:33.733 --> 24:36.475
- Go out, talk to my friends.
- We did.

24:36.562 --> 24:38.433
They said there were a lot of
people at the party that night.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.608
You could have left
and come back.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.741
This is so unfair.
How..

24:41.828 --> 24:44.395
My brother's right.
Jeremy just left.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.049
Clearly he's hiding something.

24:46.136 --> 24:47.486
Lisbon.

24:50.227 --> 24:51.185
Stay here.

24:53.796 --> 24:56.669
Rigsby, it's me.
I need an APB on Jeremy Hale.

24:56.756 --> 24:57.670
Check the airports,
he's probably

24:57.757 --> 24:59.019
got at least
two hours on us.

24:59.106 --> 25:01.891
He hasn't gone that far.
He's not on a plane.

25:01.978 --> 25:05.460
- How do you know?
- He left too much behind.

25:05.547 --> 25:07.767
Room full of photographs,
five are of Rosemary.

25:07.854 --> 25:09.420
The rest are dated
at least a year ago.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.074
Except..

25:14.164 --> 25:16.253
This one.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.778
This was taken a few
weeks ago. Brand-new.

25:18.865 --> 25:21.215
A little damaged,
but somewhat intimate.

25:24.261 --> 25:26.568
A woman's heel would make
a hole like that, wouldn't it?

25:26.655 --> 25:28.396
Yes.

25:28.483 --> 25:30.964
Being Rosemary's house, we can
assume it's Rosemary's heel.

25:31.051 --> 25:32.487
I'm still with you.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.663
Why would Rosemary
want to put her heel

25:34.750 --> 25:36.665
in this nice young
woman's picture

25:36.752 --> 25:38.580
that was taken by
her womanizing boyfriend

25:38.667 --> 25:40.756
Jeremy, huh?

25:42.845 --> 25:44.630
[instrumental music]

25:48.155 --> 25:49.199
Know her?

25:49.286 --> 25:52.420
Yeah.
That's, um, Connie Adams.

25:52.507 --> 25:54.596
My mom's bridge partner's
daughter, Connie.

26:06.869 --> 26:09.742
[rock music]

26:18.968 --> 26:21.841
[female #1]
'Hello.'

26:21.928 --> 26:24.452
- Connie?
- Can I help you?

26:24.539 --> 26:27.760
Nice necklace.
Police.

26:27.847 --> 26:30.676
We're looking for Jeremy Hale.
Is he here?

26:30.763 --> 26:32.329
Baby?

26:33.940 --> 26:35.245
[Rigsby]
'Hi, Jeremy.'

26:35.332 --> 26:37.334
- Hey.
- Let's go talk.

26:37.421 --> 26:38.684
You might want some clothes.

26:38.771 --> 26:40.773
Or a lot more whipped cream.

26:40.860 --> 26:41.904
Your call.

26:49.695 --> 26:52.045
Rosemary was killed by somebody
driving one of her own cars.

26:53.350 --> 26:54.743
Okay.

26:57.877 --> 27:00.444
A silver Chrysler.
You ever drive this car, Jeremy?

27:00.531 --> 27:02.664
No. That's the car
that Travis drove.

27:05.058 --> 27:06.320
Not my style.

27:06.407 --> 27:07.974
Thing is, we found
a glove in the car

27:08.061 --> 27:09.323
that's from
your photo lab.

27:09.410 --> 27:11.325
What are the chances
we find your DNA on it?

27:11.412 --> 27:13.893
- Travis could have taken those.
- Travis has an alibi.

27:13.980 --> 27:16.243
You could've taken the car in
order to throw suspicion on him.

27:16.330 --> 27:19.115
I could have,
I suppose, but I didn't.

27:19.202 --> 27:20.856
You left the Tennant house fast

27:20.943 --> 27:22.684
almost like you
were running away.

27:22.771 --> 27:25.644
- Why is that?
- I got into it with the kids.

27:25.731 --> 27:26.993
That Clara is insane.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.342
I thought she was
gonna assault me.

27:28.429 --> 27:29.735
They think you killed
their mother.

27:29.822 --> 27:32.085
They don't know
anything about me.

27:32.172 --> 27:34.957
- I loved her.
- Of course, you did.

27:35.044 --> 27:36.611
That's why you gave
Rosemary's necklace

27:36.698 --> 27:38.004
to your hot new girlfriend.

27:38.091 --> 27:40.223
Well, it's no good
to Rosemary, is it?

27:40.310 --> 27:42.269
So shoot me.
I'm a pragmatist.

27:42.356 --> 27:43.662
That's a good word.

27:45.576 --> 27:48.536
Miami, New York, Chicago.

27:48.623 --> 27:51.582
All widows, and all contributors
to your budding career.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.672
And all alive and well
and still good friends of mine

27:53.759 --> 27:55.195
if you care to speak
to any of them.

27:55.282 --> 27:58.677
Well, Phoebe might be
a little ambivalent about me

27:58.764 --> 28:01.680
but...the others
are, you know..

28:03.507 --> 28:06.510
- Do you know Kristina Frye?
- Uh..

28:06.597 --> 28:08.425
That name is familiar,
but no.

28:08.512 --> 28:11.951
- 'I don't think so.'
- She's Rosemary's psychic.

28:12.038 --> 28:13.517
And I think you have
met Kristina.

28:13.604 --> 28:14.736
'You took her photograph.'

28:14.823 --> 28:15.911
Jane tells us one
of your portraits

28:15.998 --> 28:17.173
is hanging in her foyer.

28:17.260 --> 28:19.045
Well, I-I take
a lot of pictures.

28:19.132 --> 28:20.655
Mm-hmm.

28:20.742 --> 28:22.483
Two beneficiaries
on the same will

28:22.570 --> 28:24.441
both intimate friends
of Rosemary's

28:24.528 --> 28:26.966
yet the two of you have
never actually met.

28:27.053 --> 28:28.794
What are the chances?

28:31.797 --> 28:32.798
I want a lawyer.

28:32.885 --> 28:35.061
[telephone ringing]

28:36.671 --> 28:39.500
[instrumental music]

28:40.588 --> 28:43.069
Hey, boss,
check this out.

28:45.419 --> 28:47.508
Info on Kristina Frye.

28:47.595 --> 28:49.075
In the last ten years,
each of these people

28:49.162 --> 28:50.685
'left her name
in their wills'

28:50.772 --> 28:53.079
'paydays ranging from
$10,000 to $ 200,000.'

28:53.166 --> 28:56.691
Maybe the psychic and Jeremy
had a business relationship

28:56.778 --> 28:57.910
fleecing vulnerable women.

28:57.997 --> 28:59.172
So maybe Jane was right.

28:59.259 --> 29:01.217
It doesn't prove anything.

29:01.304 --> 29:03.654
No, but it's a good place to
start a conversation with Frye.

29:08.311 --> 29:10.966
Kristina, how well
do you know Jeremy Hale?

29:11.053 --> 29:12.272
He was Rosemary's lover.

29:12.359 --> 29:15.014
Uh, kind of a user,
I'd say

29:15.101 --> 29:16.755
'but genuinely fond
of her, I think.'

29:16.842 --> 29:19.540
Quite a good photographer.
He took my picture.

29:19.627 --> 29:21.716
Did you know he was also
named in the victim's will?

29:21.803 --> 29:23.457
If that was Rosemary's
decision, fine.

29:23.544 --> 29:24.980
But what are
you getting at?

29:25.067 --> 29:26.634
Over the last decade,
five different people

29:26.721 --> 29:28.157
have named you
in their wills.

29:28.244 --> 29:30.377
Against my express wishes.

29:30.464 --> 29:31.595
Uh, I..

29:31.682 --> 29:33.772
I've helped hundreds
of sick clients

29:33.859 --> 29:35.948
confront their
fear of dying

29:36.035 --> 29:37.950
and I assure all of them that
I will try and speak to them

29:38.037 --> 29:39.603
after they're gone,
but I have never asked

29:39.690 --> 29:41.649
any of them
for anything ever.

29:41.736 --> 29:44.086
Then why did Jeremy get nervous
when your name was mentioned?

29:44.173 --> 29:48.264
Probably because we had sex
on a couple of occasions.

29:48.351 --> 29:50.136
We had fun.

29:50.223 --> 29:51.659
He's a good time.

29:51.746 --> 29:54.575
[chuckles]

29:54.662 --> 29:56.664
Have you spoken
to Rosemary yet?

29:56.751 --> 29:58.187
- Yes, I have.
- Oh, you did?

29:58.274 --> 29:59.275
What did she say?

29:59.362 --> 30:02.235
She seems quite
taken with you.

30:02.322 --> 30:03.845
She said you were
a good man.

30:03.932 --> 30:06.500
A deeply misguided..

30:06.587 --> 30:10.069
..and damaged man,
but good.

30:10.156 --> 30:11.505
Well, that's
very flattering.

30:11.592 --> 30:12.549
Did she happen to
mention who killed her?

30:12.636 --> 30:15.639
No.
She didn't know.

30:15.726 --> 30:18.773
But she wants me to keep trying
to help you as much as I can.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.557
Well, now that you mention it,
I'd love to hear

30:20.644 --> 30:22.603
your CD recordings of
your sessions together.

30:22.690 --> 30:24.387
Absolutely.

30:24.474 --> 30:26.259
And, uh, can you
have Rosemary appear

30:26.346 --> 30:27.608
at the reading of the will?

30:27.695 --> 30:29.566
She's a departed soul,
not a wedding singer.

30:29.653 --> 30:31.090
You can't book her
in advance.

30:31.177 --> 30:33.179
Ah, yeah, I guess, uh,
time doesn't mean much

30:33.266 --> 30:34.615
when you're dead forever.

30:34.702 --> 30:36.704
- No schedule to keep.
- What's the rush?

30:36.791 --> 30:38.010
- Right.
- Mmm.

30:40.490 --> 30:43.363
[instrumental music]

30:53.677 --> 30:54.940
Nice cradling.

30:55.027 --> 30:57.594
- You play lacrosse?
- No.

30:57.681 --> 31:00.815
- Fast-moving sticks scare me.
- Find out who did it yet?

31:00.902 --> 31:02.164
Not yet.

31:05.211 --> 31:06.647
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:06.734 --> 31:07.691
Find anything?

31:10.172 --> 31:11.782
I think Kristina Frye
is responsible

31:11.870 --> 31:14.350
for your mother's death.

31:14.437 --> 31:16.483
I need you to ask her
to conduct a séance

31:16.570 --> 31:18.572
to contact your mom
at the reading of the will.

31:18.659 --> 31:20.879
I don't understand.

31:20.966 --> 31:22.489
How is getting
in touch with my mom

31:22.576 --> 31:23.882
gonna help you
catch Kristina?

31:23.969 --> 31:25.231
Well, obviously
she's not really gonna

31:25.318 --> 31:26.667
get in touch
with your mom.

31:26.754 --> 31:29.539
She's a fraud.
I'm gonna expose her.

31:29.626 --> 31:31.280
How do you know she
won't really pull it off?

31:31.367 --> 31:32.803
Well, she won't,
because she can't.

31:39.506 --> 31:41.334
- I don't like it.
- 'Me neither.'

31:41.421 --> 31:43.423
- 'What's the alternative?'
- It's immoral.

31:43.510 --> 31:45.033
I don't know about that.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.166
Your brain gets cooked
if you use 'em a lot.

31:47.253 --> 31:49.298
'Make you infertile, too.'

31:49.385 --> 31:51.431
What are you talking about?

31:51.518 --> 31:53.433
Microwaves.
What are you talking about?

31:53.520 --> 31:54.782
The séancethis evening.

31:54.869 --> 31:56.436
We were looking
at the microwave.

31:56.523 --> 31:58.177
The séancehas nothing
to do with anything.

31:58.264 --> 32:01.267
It's wrong to play with
that stuff, raising the dead.

32:01.354 --> 32:03.051
Uh, we're not actually
gonna be doing that

32:03.138 --> 32:05.184
raising dead people.

32:05.271 --> 32:07.621
You say that
but you don't know.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.363
You're mocking the occult.

32:10.450 --> 32:12.669
You don't have any belief
in the afterlife.

32:12.756 --> 32:14.454
You don't know
what you're getting into.

32:14.541 --> 32:17.674
Well, I know that séances
are tools that con artists

32:17.761 --> 32:19.720
like Kristina use
to manipulate people.

32:19.807 --> 32:20.982
Boo!

32:25.769 --> 32:28.598
Yeah, laugh.
Go ahead.

32:28.685 --> 32:29.904
It's really important to you

32:29.991 --> 32:31.558
that Kristina's
a fake, isn't it?

32:31.645 --> 32:34.778
Because if she's not,
if she does have a gift

32:34.865 --> 32:37.433
everything you mock,
everything you discredit

32:37.520 --> 32:40.393
everything you stand for
gets turned upside down.

32:40.480 --> 32:43.352
Um...yeah. True.

32:43.439 --> 32:45.354
Unlikely, but true.

32:45.441 --> 32:47.182
And what if your family's
looking down at you tonight

32:47.269 --> 32:49.402
from the séance,
trying to talk to you

32:49.489 --> 32:51.578
but they can't
because you won't believe?

32:53.928 --> 32:55.277
Well, that would
be very sad.

33:03.416 --> 33:05.505
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's okay.

33:23.523 --> 33:25.307
Really, it's quite irregular.

33:25.394 --> 33:27.962
It's what my mother wanted.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.616
Very well.

33:29.703 --> 33:31.357
If you can all
please sit down?

33:35.274 --> 33:37.667
'At the request of Rosemary'

33:37.754 --> 33:40.366
'and her daughter Clara'

33:40.453 --> 33:43.586
the reading of the will
shall be prefaced with a..

33:43.673 --> 33:45.153
What do you call it?

33:45.240 --> 33:48.330
A contact ritual
Séance,some call it.

33:49.766 --> 33:51.855
A séance.

33:51.942 --> 33:55.424
Good evening, everybody,
and welcome.

33:55.511 --> 33:57.339
With your help tonight

33:57.426 --> 34:01.126
I'm gonna try
and contact Rosemary.

34:01.213 --> 34:02.562
'Will you all
please hold hands'

34:02.649 --> 34:05.043
with your neighbor
on either side?

34:05.130 --> 34:06.087
Everybody.

34:08.524 --> 34:11.571
Good. Thank you.

34:11.658 --> 34:14.443
Thank you. Would you please
turn the lights down?

34:19.535 --> 34:23.278
The veil will be drawn back
and Rosemary will come to us

34:23.365 --> 34:25.933
as long as we believe.

34:26.020 --> 34:28.675
As long as we believe.

34:33.549 --> 34:35.377
Everybody concentrate
on the candle

34:35.464 --> 34:37.075
in the center of the table.

34:38.728 --> 34:40.165
Look at it

34:40.252 --> 34:43.864
and concentrate on Rosemary.

34:43.951 --> 34:45.909
Come to us, Rosemary.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.043
'Come to us.'

34:51.567 --> 34:53.308
Speak.

35:01.403 --> 35:03.362
[Rosemary]
'Kristina.'

35:03.449 --> 35:05.190
'Kristina.'

35:05.277 --> 35:07.148
It's me, Rosemary.

35:07.235 --> 35:09.498
I'm here, as I
promised you I would be.

35:11.805 --> 35:15.765
'All your friends and family
are here, too, Rosemary.'

35:15.852 --> 35:17.767
'Is there anything
that you'd like to say?'

35:19.943 --> 35:21.380
Or ask?

35:23.947 --> 35:25.427
Rosemary?

35:27.081 --> 35:28.822
[Rosemary]
'Clara?'

35:30.258 --> 35:31.564
'Clara?'

35:33.522 --> 35:35.307
Mom?

35:37.439 --> 35:38.875
'Why, Clara?'

35:40.442 --> 35:42.140
'Why did you do it?'

36:06.512 --> 36:08.166
I know what you're doing,
and it's not gonna work.

36:10.516 --> 36:11.734
What do you mean?

36:11.821 --> 36:13.475
This is all a scheme
that you and Kristina

36:13.562 --> 36:15.347
cooked up, isn't it?

36:15.434 --> 36:18.524
Well, it's very effective,
but I'm not buying it.

36:18.611 --> 36:20.917
I'm not gonna buy it.
I'm not buying it. I can't.

36:22.441 --> 36:25.966
- I can't.
- No.

36:26.053 --> 36:27.054
No, it's I..

36:28.664 --> 36:31.014
'It's...I'm..'

36:33.147 --> 36:34.148
Next cue's up.

36:34.235 --> 36:35.454
[Clara]
'This isn't happening.'

36:35.541 --> 36:37.325
Got it.

36:42.025 --> 36:44.550
[Rosemary on computer]
'Why, Clara, why?'

36:44.637 --> 36:46.073
Who's doing this?

36:49.381 --> 36:50.904
'I'm sorry, mom.'

36:54.429 --> 36:57.302
I'm so sorry.

36:57.389 --> 36:59.956
[Jane]
'Was it you, Clara?'

37:00.043 --> 37:03.090
Were you in the car?

37:03.177 --> 37:05.701
Is that why she's here?

37:05.788 --> 37:07.355
'Is that what's
caused all this?'

37:18.018 --> 37:18.975
Yes.

37:25.199 --> 37:26.635
Yes.

37:30.596 --> 37:32.815
I got mad.

37:32.902 --> 37:36.166
- I just got mad.
- Why?

37:36.254 --> 37:39.213
She told me..

37:39.300 --> 37:42.434
...that she was gonna
change the will again

37:42.521 --> 37:44.131
to disinherit Travis.

37:46.133 --> 37:48.266
She said that it was
for his own good.

37:50.398 --> 37:53.575
And she wouldn't
listen to me.

37:53.662 --> 37:55.882
We said some harsh
things to each other.

37:55.969 --> 38:00.626
So...I rode the train
down from Clear Lake

38:00.713 --> 38:03.846
to speak to her
in person.

38:03.933 --> 38:05.935
Make her..

38:06.022 --> 38:07.850
...see things rationally.

38:08.982 --> 38:11.114
I knew she was..

38:11.201 --> 38:13.856
...going to see
her damn psychic.

38:13.943 --> 38:15.684
And..

38:15.771 --> 38:17.425
I didn't wanna run
into that creep Jeremy

38:17.512 --> 38:20.820
so I went to the house

38:20.907 --> 38:24.171
to go pick up one
of the cars to meet her.

38:24.258 --> 38:27.957
'I saw her after
she left Kristina's'

38:29.045 --> 38:30.830
'and I called her'

38:30.917 --> 38:33.267
'so that she wouldn't
be freaked out'

38:33.354 --> 38:36.444
'that I would turn up
in the middle of the night'

38:36.531 --> 38:39.534
and she didn't
pick up the phone

38:39.621 --> 38:42.320
for her own daughter,
and..

38:44.191 --> 38:45.497
I just got mad.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.591
No!

38:59.511 --> 39:01.034
Thank you for your
honesty, Clara.

39:02.862 --> 39:04.733
How did you know
that it was me?

39:04.820 --> 39:07.475
Uh, well, uh..

39:07.562 --> 39:09.216
It didn't occur
to me until later

39:09.303 --> 39:12.350
when you started trying
to pin the blame on Jeremy.

39:12.437 --> 39:15.265
But when you first came in here,
you expressed great horror

39:15.353 --> 39:16.963
that your mother
had died in the gutter.

39:17.050 --> 39:19.835
'Not on the road, not in
the sidewalk, but the gutter.'

39:19.922 --> 39:21.794
For her to die in
the gutter like that, it's..

39:24.013 --> 39:26.407
...like garbage,
it's-it's horrible.

39:26.494 --> 39:28.627
And how could you have known
that she died in the gutter

39:28.714 --> 39:31.194
unless...you'd been there?

39:36.069 --> 39:37.636
I did it for Travis.

39:37.723 --> 39:39.594
And for yourself.

39:39.681 --> 39:42.510
She said that
she would protect us!

39:46.906 --> 39:50.126
She promised my dad
that she would.

39:52.477 --> 39:55.741
Parents are supposed
to protect their kids.

39:57.699 --> 39:59.571
[Teresa]
'Yes, they are.'

40:02.095 --> 40:04.097
Can I see my brother now?

40:04.184 --> 40:06.055
Sure.

40:14.107 --> 40:16.588
I know you weren't
thinking right..

40:16.675 --> 40:19.329
...when you did
what you did.

40:19.417 --> 40:22.289
Be good to Aunt Jo.

40:22.376 --> 40:25.771
And don't-don't leave
your clothes everywhere and

40:25.858 --> 40:27.207
be respectful, okay?

40:28.600 --> 40:29.688
I will.

40:33.648 --> 40:34.606
I love you.

40:39.480 --> 40:40.612
I love you, too.

40:51.536 --> 40:53.451
Thank you for letting
me talk to her.

40:53.538 --> 40:54.495
You bet.

41:06.072 --> 41:07.856
[clearing throat]

41:11.338 --> 41:12.992
You sleep here?

41:13.079 --> 41:14.602
Uh..

41:14.689 --> 41:16.735
Yes, sometimes.

41:16.822 --> 41:18.693
Uh, the noise
relaxes me, you know.

41:18.780 --> 41:20.086
It's like the sea.

41:24.699 --> 41:25.961
Can I help you?

41:26.048 --> 41:27.746
I just came to
pick up my recordings.

41:27.833 --> 41:28.964
Help yourself.

41:29.965 --> 41:31.445
Thanks.

41:33.795 --> 41:35.101
I need to talk to you.

41:35.188 --> 41:36.755
Fire away.

41:36.842 --> 41:38.800
In private.

41:38.887 --> 41:39.932
This is private.

41:40.019 --> 41:41.107
More private.

41:44.371 --> 41:45.459
Oh..

41:48.941 --> 41:50.551
[clearing throat]

41:58.516 --> 41:59.865
So..

41:59.952 --> 42:02.084
Promise me you won't interrupt.
Hear me out.

42:02.171 --> 42:05.392
Okay, I promise.

42:05.479 --> 42:08.090
- I talked to your wife.
- Oh, hang on, this is--

42:13.226 --> 42:14.793
Ever since your wife
and daughter were killed

42:14.880 --> 42:16.621
there's a question
about that night's events

42:16.708 --> 42:18.318
that's been
tormenting you, yes?

42:20.886 --> 42:22.278
- Yes?
- Yes.

42:25.934 --> 42:27.022
Your wife wants
me to tell you

42:27.109 --> 42:29.634
that your daughter
never woke up.

42:29.721 --> 42:32.027
She didn't know
what happened.

42:32.114 --> 42:35.074
She wasn't scared,
not even for a second.

42:38.947 --> 42:42.211
You're done channeling?
That's it?

42:42.298 --> 42:44.039
- That's it.
- Thanks.

42:54.659 --> 42:56.530
[Kristina]
'Goodbye, Mr. Jane.'

43:07.280 --> 43:08.673
[sobbing]

43:10.065 --> 43:12.372
[slow instrumental music]

43:30.259 --> 43:32.479
[theme music]

43:42.402 --> 43:45.318
[music continues]
