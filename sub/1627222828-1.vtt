WEBVTT

00:29.641 --> 00:31.277
Are we alone out here?

00:31.342 --> 00:34.180
Yes, sir.

00:34.246 --> 00:36.514
No Americans in the area, sir.

00:40.018 --> 00:41.452
Run the program.

00:48.693 --> 00:51.529
I said run the program, Dr. Lee.

00:52.430 --> 00:53.698
Yes, captain.

01:33.071 --> 01:35.640
All of america's
personal communications

01:35.707 --> 01:38.743
brought down through
a satellite in mere seconds.

01:38.810 --> 01:44.250
There are no secrets anymore
thanks to our work, Dr. Lee.

01:44.316 --> 01:46.851
Don't worry, Dr. Lee.

01:46.918 --> 01:48.786
The American's won't
find us here.

02:03.701 --> 02:06.104
Captain! Something hit us!

02:07.772 --> 02:09.674
A ship? The Americans?

02:09.741 --> 02:11.676
I... don't think so...

02:11.743 --> 02:13.379
I think it's... alive.

02:23.154 --> 02:24.632
I'm sending a
distress signal, captain.

02:24.656 --> 02:26.057
No... no...

02:26.124 --> 02:30.195
The technology on this
ship could... start a war.

04:46.164 --> 04:49.901
No two ways about it.
You got a raw deal, commander.

04:49.967 --> 04:51.270
<i>I screwed the pooch, captain.</i>

04:51.336 --> 04:53.272
You stood behind your people.

04:53.338 --> 04:56.275
And my sister and
I are forever grateful.

04:56.341 --> 04:58.709
Commander lynch did
what she had to do

04:58.776 --> 05:01.346
to save as many lives as
possible from that thing.

05:01.413 --> 05:04.216
<i>Your sister deep-sixed
a destroyer to save lives</i>

05:04.283 --> 05:05.850
<i>from "a thing that
doesn't exist."</i>

05:05.917 --> 05:07.785
Oh, it exists, Brian,

05:07.852 --> 05:11.323
just like the Chinese
ship circling our waters.

05:11.390 --> 05:13.958
So you'll be going out there
to see it, yes?

05:14.025 --> 05:17.196
<i>No. The admiral is handling
it all from D.C.</i>

05:17.262 --> 05:19.231
According to him,
it's legal transit

05:19.298 --> 05:21.666
of the U.S. territorial seas
conducted in accordance

05:21.732 --> 05:23.668
with the law of
the sea convention

05:23.734 --> 05:25.603
and we're supposed
to stay out of it.

05:25.670 --> 05:30.641
So they trust
a foreign government,

05:30.708 --> 05:34.846
an enemy, but not
your sister, right?

05:34.912 --> 05:36.381
Hmm, looks that way.

05:36.448 --> 05:39.284
Doesn't look that way.
That's the way it is.

05:39.351 --> 05:41.119
They said it's a "product of
fabrication,

05:41.186 --> 05:44.088
exhaustion and confusion
and nothing else."

05:44.155 --> 05:46.791
You know, your sister's
a lot of things,

05:46.858 --> 05:49.060
but she's no liar.

05:49.127 --> 05:52.431
<i>If she said a
million-pound megalodon</i>

05:52.498 --> 05:55.467
<i>ate her ship, well...</i>

05:55.534 --> 05:58.237
Hey, I'm gonna believe it.

05:58.303 --> 06:01.172
Because just like you,

06:01.240 --> 06:03.875
your sister is
a very good person.

06:03.941 --> 06:06.211
So are you.
You stood behind her.

06:06.278 --> 06:08.118
I don't know what else
you were supposed to do.

06:08.146 --> 06:12.083
Let's hope the admiral feels
the same way during my hearing.

06:12.150 --> 06:13.794
<i>Your sister shouldn't
have been court-martialed.</i>

06:13.818 --> 06:15.354
<i>She shouldn't have.</i>

06:15.420 --> 06:18.223
And I'll be goddamned if
she'll be court-martialed alone.

06:18.290 --> 06:19.534
You'll get your rank back,
commander.

06:19.558 --> 06:21.025
I'm sure of it.

06:21.092 --> 06:23.761
<i>Will they give me back
my submarine project, too?</i>

06:23.828 --> 06:27.965
I hate to see that
beautiful piece of machinery

06:28.032 --> 06:31.669
<i>mothballed at the final
testing stage.</i>

06:31.736 --> 06:36.140
You know, a deep-sea machine
like that

06:36.208 --> 06:39.710
might even confirm
the existence of that megalodon

06:39.777 --> 06:41.679
if they just let me finish,

06:41.746 --> 06:43.515
if they just let me
back on the project

06:43.582 --> 06:46.717
which I don't think they will.

06:46.784 --> 06:48.119
Captain lynch!

06:48.187 --> 06:49.787
We're getting
an abnormal distress call.

06:49.854 --> 06:52.089
Tuan located it and we're
nearly on top of the ship now.

06:52.156 --> 06:54.476
We still haven't deciphered
the code on whose ship that is.

06:54.526 --> 06:56.794
Seems to have been
intentionally masked, captain.

06:56.861 --> 06:59.298
Hmm. Let's peel back that mask.

06:59.364 --> 07:00.542
See if it has anything
to do with

07:00.566 --> 07:01.899
those ships circling our waters.

07:01.966 --> 07:05.770
- Let's get underway.
- Yes, ma'am.

07:05.836 --> 07:06.938
Thank you, commander.

07:07.004 --> 07:10.074
Happy to do it. Stay safe.

07:17.081 --> 07:21.453
Ah, see, I'm not saying
she's not good at her job,

07:21.520 --> 07:23.754
not at all.

07:23.821 --> 07:25.324
I'm just saying...

07:25.390 --> 07:30.495
Just saying... when are you not
just saying something, xo?

07:30.562 --> 07:32.763
Yes, tuan.

07:32.830 --> 07:37.134
I'm just saying
she is not aggressive.

07:38.403 --> 07:41.406
Is that a bad thing
or a good thing?

07:41.473 --> 07:44.809
Is that a bad thing?

07:44.875 --> 07:48.145
We are in the Navy, hmm?

07:48.213 --> 07:51.148
Not some damn summer camp.

07:51.216 --> 07:54.286
You know I'm right,
you know I'm right.

07:55.820 --> 07:59.957
That's why I'm already
lieutenant commander, hmm?

08:00.024 --> 08:03.160
I got that fight.
I'm old school.

08:03.228 --> 08:06.331
I'm about kickin' ass
and takin' names,

08:06.398 --> 08:09.967
not playing grab-ass
Kumbaya with our enemies.

08:10.034 --> 08:11.802
How about your friends, sir?

08:11.869 --> 08:13.338
He doesn't have any.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.843
Y'all funny.

08:21.078 --> 08:22.414
Captain on the deck!

08:24.849 --> 08:26.851
What's so funny in here, people?

08:29.521 --> 08:31.590
Nothing, captain.

08:31.657 --> 08:33.991
We're still getting the
distress signals, captain.

08:34.058 --> 08:35.427
So I heard, tuan.

08:35.494 --> 08:38.563
Ahearn suggested
we reorient to the location.

08:38.630 --> 08:41.866
I assumed that's
what you wanted to do.

08:41.932 --> 08:43.901
You assumed right, ahearn.

08:43.968 --> 08:45.470
Thank you, captain.

08:45.537 --> 08:47.905
But you should stop assuming
while you're ahead.

08:47.972 --> 08:50.275
Understand me?

08:50.342 --> 08:52.043
Aye, ma'am.

08:52.109 --> 08:53.944
How close are we, tuan?

08:54.011 --> 08:55.614
Nearly on top of it, ma'am.

08:55.681 --> 08:57.215
We see anything?

08:57.282 --> 09:01.286
Negative, ma'am,
but still receiving the signal.

09:01.353 --> 09:04.690
Whatever it is, she's sunk.

09:04.756 --> 09:05.956
Any signs of life, tuan?

09:06.023 --> 09:07.559
No s.O.L., ma'am.

09:07.626 --> 09:10.729
I'm not seeing
any more signs, ma'am.

09:10.796 --> 09:12.129
Uh, ma'am?

09:12.197 --> 09:14.232
We have a confirmation
of an unknown object

09:14.299 --> 09:17.001
in the water from the deck crew.

09:17.068 --> 09:18.135
Any idea what, Wilco?

09:18.203 --> 09:21.239
Any idea what it is?

09:21.306 --> 09:23.241
Debris?

09:26.311 --> 09:27.311
Really?

09:27.346 --> 09:30.716
What is the unknown
object, Wilco?

09:30.782 --> 09:32.250
It's a survivor.

10:19.631 --> 10:23.067
She's seen some pretty
intense exposure.

10:23.134 --> 10:25.903
At least two or three
days worth,

10:25.970 --> 10:30.007
additionally lacerations,
some bruising,

10:30.074 --> 10:32.244
very likely a concussion.

10:32.310 --> 10:34.446
She's a Chinese national.

10:34.513 --> 10:37.948
Pretty close to
U.S. waters, captain.

10:38.015 --> 10:40.951
Nothing about them in
our files or schedules.

10:41.018 --> 10:43.422
Keep an eye on her, Dr. Ray.

10:43.488 --> 10:45.690
I have a few questions
for her when she wakes up.

10:45.757 --> 10:47.192
Aye, ma'am.

10:57.502 --> 10:58.502
Ma'am?

11:00.070 --> 11:03.140
Do you think
she's Chinese intelligence

11:03.208 --> 11:08.547
and her ship was on some
kind of off-label mission?

11:10.348 --> 11:12.818
I think this
is above my pay grade.

11:12.884 --> 11:14.319
Hmm.

11:14.386 --> 11:15.666
It's time we loop
the admiral in.

11:17.189 --> 11:18.757
And you know what
I'll do then, ahearn?

11:18.824 --> 11:20.492
What, ma'am?

11:20.559 --> 11:24.563
Whatever they tell me,
grab-ass Kumbaya or otherwise.

11:27.265 --> 11:28.500
Yes, ma'am.

11:28.567 --> 11:29.868
Captain!

11:29.935 --> 11:31.436
Yes, brand?

11:31.503 --> 11:33.371
You just oughta see this, ma'am.

11:33.438 --> 11:35.240
See what?

11:47.151 --> 11:48.453
Is that a Chinese ship, ma'am?

11:50.154 --> 11:51.088
Affirmative, brand.

11:51.155 --> 11:52.491
What are they doing here?

11:52.557 --> 11:54.067
They're not supposed to be
in these waters.

11:54.091 --> 11:55.594
That's why
we need answers, brand.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.666
Captain on the bridge!

12:01.733 --> 12:03.033
Affirmative.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.402
I will send that message.

12:04.469 --> 12:06.238
Was that commander Moore?
Admiral green?

12:06.304 --> 12:07.472
No, ma'am.

12:07.539 --> 12:09.708
That was the captain
of the tsai.

12:09.774 --> 12:11.576
He's spoken with our
superiors in San Diego,

12:11.643 --> 12:14.044
and says he has full legal
permission to travel our waters.

12:14.111 --> 12:15.547
He is claiming innocent passage.

12:15.614 --> 12:17.616
They're requesting that
we and all the U.S. ships

12:17.682 --> 12:19.718
evacuate the area
so they can search for a ship

12:19.784 --> 12:21.920
that went off-course
during bad weather.

12:21.987 --> 12:23.221
Bad weather?

12:23.288 --> 12:24.890
Bad weather, ma'am.

12:24.956 --> 12:27.396
Their ship is assumed lost and
they are looking for survivors.

12:27.459 --> 12:29.494
Was there additional
wreckage, radar, sonar?

12:29.561 --> 12:32.797
I am picking up
something below us, captain.

12:32.864 --> 12:33.798
Below us?

12:33.865 --> 12:35.267
Yes, ma'am.

12:35.333 --> 12:38.637
From what I can surmise,
there is a tall shelf below us,

12:38.703 --> 12:40.572
nearly 20 fathoms.

12:40.639 --> 12:42.807
It appears there's
something there,

12:42.874 --> 12:44.409
most likely the survivor's ship.

12:46.110 --> 12:48.680
I find this all highly suspect.

12:48.747 --> 12:51.550
- Do you agree, ahearn?
- Yes, ma'am.

12:51.616 --> 12:53.218
It's not every day
a Chinese destroyer

12:53.285 --> 12:55.353
rolls into our town
without prior authorization.

12:55.420 --> 12:57.923
Agreed, ma'am. Very fishy.

12:57.989 --> 13:01.326
- Wilco?
- Yes, ma'am?

13:01.393 --> 13:02.827
Tell them we found a survivor.

13:03.962 --> 13:06.298
Something wrong, ahearn?

13:06.364 --> 13:07.599
No, ma'am.

13:07.666 --> 13:09.734
Tell them
she's still unconscious

13:09.801 --> 13:11.803
and their ship seems
to have sunk.

13:11.870 --> 13:14.739
Don't tell them precisely
where if they're not asking.

13:14.806 --> 13:16.508
Yes, ma'am.

13:16.575 --> 13:18.084
Fewer moving parts,
the better, people.

13:18.108 --> 13:19.311
Let's keep that all in mind.

13:19.377 --> 13:21.279
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

13:30.120 --> 13:32.791
Actually, hold that, Wilco.

13:32.857 --> 13:35.794
Tuan, you speak mandarin,
don't you?

13:35.860 --> 13:38.162
Yes, ma'am...
Well, around the house.

13:38.229 --> 13:39.531
I'm a little bit rusty.

13:39.598 --> 13:41.165
Rusty like you mix up ducks
and geese

13:41.232 --> 13:44.436
or rusty like the bed that fell
out of my father's truck?

13:44.502 --> 13:46.136
First one, I think, ma'am.

13:46.204 --> 13:48.406
Look at
lieutenant commander ahearn.

13:48.473 --> 13:52.510
Tell me what he's thinking...
In mandarin.

13:52.577 --> 13:56.281
I wish I didn't have
such small hands.

13:58.115 --> 13:59.517
That'll work fine.

13:59.584 --> 14:02.420
Wilco, put her on the comms
with the Chinese.

14:02.487 --> 14:04.289
Aye, ma'am. Already on it.

14:04.356 --> 14:07.826
Attention, cns tsai,
this is the USS king.

14:07.892 --> 14:09.995
Do you read me?

14:10.061 --> 14:11.262
Don't look so worried, ahearn.

14:11.329 --> 14:12.864
I'm sure she
said something nice.

14:12.931 --> 14:16.001
Your survivor is unconscious
and you ship seems to have sunk.

14:16.067 --> 14:17.202
Ma'am?

14:17.268 --> 14:18.837
Yes, tuan?

14:18.903 --> 14:20.572
They're saying by
international agreement,

14:20.639 --> 14:23.808
we must hand over
the survivor and depart.

14:23.875 --> 14:26.044
Hand over and depart?

14:26.111 --> 14:29.581
Well, that's not just arrogant.
It's wrong.

14:29.648 --> 14:32.050
I can put them on
your comms if you want.

14:32.117 --> 14:34.719
No. Let's keep it impersonal.

14:34.786 --> 14:37.255
Tell them I need
to pass it up the flagpole.

14:37.322 --> 14:40.258
We have received your request

14:40.325 --> 14:43.194
and must pass it on to
our commanding officers.

14:43.261 --> 14:45.463
All right.

14:45.530 --> 14:47.298
Yes, I will tell her.

14:47.365 --> 14:48.833
What did they say, tuan?

14:48.900 --> 14:51.369
They said that
it's an act of war.

14:51.436 --> 14:54.339
An act of... an act of war?

14:54.406 --> 14:56.608
Not handing back a survivor

14:56.675 --> 14:59.310
is said it will be
seen as an act of war

14:59.377 --> 15:00.912
between the two countries.

15:00.979 --> 15:02.981
What should I tell them?

15:03.048 --> 15:04.983
End all communications!

15:05.050 --> 15:06.418
Put the big guns on the horn!

15:06.484 --> 15:08.053
Aye, ma'am.

15:08.119 --> 15:09.788
Ahearn?

15:09.854 --> 15:11.956
Do you have the
copy of the unclos?

15:12.023 --> 15:14.259
Yes, in my berth, ma'am.

15:14.325 --> 15:16.494
I want to check
the innocent passage.

15:16.561 --> 15:20.365
Brand, go and fetch
ahearn's book from his berth.

15:20.432 --> 15:22.067
Right away, ma'am!

15:22.133 --> 15:25.437
Ma'am, permission to exit the
bridge to find the book myself.

15:25.503 --> 15:29.040
I'm not a hundred
that I know where it is.

15:29.107 --> 15:30.442
Permission granted.

15:30.508 --> 15:31.910
Thank you, captain.

16:10.582 --> 16:12.484
What do you think?

16:12.550 --> 16:13.952
She'll live.

16:15.286 --> 16:17.622
Can you wake her up?

16:17.689 --> 16:19.557
I don't think I should, sir.

16:22.594 --> 16:24.295
Is something the matter?

16:24.362 --> 16:26.831
World war III.

16:26.898 --> 16:27.898
What?

16:29.467 --> 16:30.902
Never mind.

16:30.969 --> 16:34.506
Just let me know
the minute she wakes up.

16:34.572 --> 16:37.243
I'll let the captain
know the minute it happens.

16:37.308 --> 16:39.611
Let me know.

16:39.677 --> 16:41.446
I'll keep the captain apprised.

16:44.949 --> 16:47.786
She is dealing directly
with the Chinese Navy.

16:47.852 --> 16:49.921
She has not the time
nor the inclination

16:49.988 --> 16:52.524
to be checking in
on sleeping beauty.

16:53.825 --> 16:55.059
Let me know.

16:55.126 --> 16:56.528
Yes, sir.

17:12.377 --> 17:15.181
Yes, sir. I understand, sir.

17:15.247 --> 17:16.614
Thank you, admiral green.

17:21.686 --> 17:24.190
Should we ready the survivor
for transport, ma'am?

17:24.256 --> 17:26.057
No. We're staying here.

17:27.892 --> 17:30.595
Admiral green wants
to keep her here?

17:30.662 --> 17:32.264
He wants us to do nothing,

17:32.330 --> 17:35.767
not engage with the Chinese
in any way to hurt or to help.

17:35.834 --> 17:37.511
We don't make a move
until they sort things out

17:37.535 --> 17:39.904
with the Chinese directly,
which will take the day.

17:39.971 --> 17:41.039
Yes, ma'am.

17:41.105 --> 17:42.507
We're holding
our position, people.

17:42.574 --> 17:44.008
Stay on your toes.

17:44.075 --> 17:46.144
Ma'am?

17:46.212 --> 17:47.579
Yes, Wilco?

17:47.645 --> 17:50.249
The watch crew says that
they're aiming at us...

17:50.316 --> 17:51.783
They're what, Wilco?

17:55.753 --> 17:58.389
And readying their
munitions, ma'am.

18:04.896 --> 18:09.167
Indeed they are.
All right! Battle stations!

18:09.235 --> 18:11.512
We cannot let them get past us
and get to the San Diego shore!

18:11.536 --> 18:12.536
Yes, ma'am.

18:30.088 --> 18:31.823
Are they reacting, tan?

18:31.890 --> 18:35.593
They're moving into battle
readiness, I believe, captain.

18:37.263 --> 18:38.529
Good.

18:39.497 --> 18:41.666
They are distracted.

18:42.867 --> 18:46.170
If they fire,
we send back two, people!

18:46.238 --> 18:48.340
Let 'em know they messed
with the wrong ship!

18:48.406 --> 18:49.774
- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am!

18:49.841 --> 18:52.443
We await your order
to fire, captain.

18:54.213 --> 18:55.914
I await my orders, as well, tan.

18:55.980 --> 18:58.183
And the imminent arrival
of the armada.

19:02.620 --> 19:05.590
Yes, captain.

19:20.972 --> 19:22.106
What was that?

19:22.173 --> 19:23.409
Was that us?

19:23.474 --> 19:24.742
Was that us!?

19:24.809 --> 19:26.412
Who fired without my command?

19:26.477 --> 19:28.046
It wasn't us, ma'am.

19:31.417 --> 19:32.717
I know what's happening.

19:35.421 --> 19:37.455
What, ma'am?

19:37.522 --> 19:38.823
Megalodons!

19:47.598 --> 19:49.234
Keep your sights
on those things!

19:49.301 --> 19:50.568
Yes, ma'am.

19:56.541 --> 19:58.344
It's the Meg... I'm positive.

19:58.410 --> 19:59.811
And, uh...

20:01.012 --> 20:03.081
What? What?

20:06.484 --> 20:08.052
There's more than one!

20:08.119 --> 20:09.687
What?

20:09.754 --> 20:11.823
I see three fins,
Brian, three fins!

20:11.889 --> 20:14.826
Get outta there, Emily!
Get out of there now!

20:14.892 --> 20:16.694
Your sister barely survived one.

20:16.761 --> 20:18.563
You won't be able to stop three.

20:18.629 --> 20:20.932
<i>Are they coming for you yet?</i>

20:20.999 --> 20:21.999
No.

20:22.033 --> 20:23.278
The Chinese ship
is firing on 'em.

20:23.302 --> 20:24.869
I think it's got them agitated.

20:24.936 --> 20:26.571
<i>It's like shooting
a tank with a pistol!</i>

20:26.637 --> 20:28.240
Just get out of there!

20:28.307 --> 20:30.617
If they come anywhere near us,
you blow those things to hell!

20:30.641 --> 20:32.277
Ma'am, yes, ma'am!

20:32.344 --> 20:34.846
Emily? You must leave!

20:34.912 --> 20:38.716
I can't. I can't just leave.

20:38.783 --> 20:40.185
Look, you cannot make a move.

20:40.252 --> 20:41.795
You cannot make a
move towards that ship, Emily,

20:41.819 --> 20:44.555
- or admiral green...
- I know!

20:44.622 --> 20:46.262
And you can't say
word one about the megs.

20:46.291 --> 20:47.759
I know!

20:47.825 --> 20:50.895
Well, you know what
he'll do if the admiral

20:50.962 --> 20:53.798
hears any more talk about
megalodons or even sharks...

20:53.865 --> 20:56.667
I know! It's just sitting
here like this...

21:01.139 --> 21:02.139
Full ahead!

21:02.173 --> 21:03.173
Yes, sir.

21:03.208 --> 21:05.277
Full ahead! Full ahead!

21:06.778 --> 21:08.514
Look, they're
not our responsibility

21:08.579 --> 21:10.615
and I'm living proof
of his thoughts on megalodons

21:10.681 --> 21:14.118
<i>and stepping out when it's your
authority not to step out.</i>

21:14.186 --> 21:16.054
And you definitely cannot fire
at them

21:16.120 --> 21:17.332
while
they're surrounding the ship.

21:17.356 --> 21:18.457
If you miss...

21:18.524 --> 21:21.659
I get it! World war III.

21:21.726 --> 21:23.003
<i>Look, I wish I wasn't
trapped here</i>

21:23.027 --> 21:25.029
with my sub tarped
like a naked statue.

21:25.096 --> 21:28.599
And I could come and help you,
but your objective is clear.

21:28.666 --> 21:30.134
Please listen.

21:30.202 --> 21:33.638
Get the footage you need to
prove your sister's case

21:33.704 --> 21:36.574
that these things are real,

21:36.641 --> 21:38.477
<i>that that beast
destroyed her ship</i>

21:38.544 --> 21:43.182
and a Russian sub and put us
on the brink of conflict

21:43.248 --> 21:44.516
with the Russian army,

21:44.582 --> 21:46.318
<i>and then get out of there.</i>

21:46.385 --> 21:48.586
We can't just leave
'em to die, Brian!

21:48.653 --> 21:52.324
Look, I'll contact admiral green
and tell him what's happening.

21:52.391 --> 21:54.460
He won't believe me,

21:54.526 --> 21:56.961
but I'm already in it and how
much worse could it get, right?

21:57.028 --> 22:00.698
Oh, it can get a lot worse.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.808
Ma'am, we're ready
to fire on those things

22:10.875 --> 22:12.610
when you give us the command.

22:14.379 --> 22:16.848
With all due respect, captain,

22:16.914 --> 22:19.318
I think we should be
departing immediately.

22:19.384 --> 22:22.221
Those sharks could turn
on us at any moment.

22:22.287 --> 22:23.664
And the Chinese
are way too distracted

22:23.688 --> 22:25.224
to start anything with us now.

22:25.290 --> 22:26.691
Now's our chance.

22:26.757 --> 22:28.393
We're staying here.

22:28.460 --> 22:31.762
- But captain...
- We're staying right here!

22:31.829 --> 22:35.534
Captain, if those things
turn on us...

22:35.601 --> 22:36.868
If those things come at us,

22:36.934 --> 22:39.837
do you think that
we can outpace them?

22:39.904 --> 22:42.508
You see how fast they are?

22:42.574 --> 22:43.941
We're staying here.

22:44.008 --> 22:47.246
Killian, tell engineering
to kill the engines.

22:47.312 --> 22:49.792
Nothing noisy that will attract
those things before we have to.

22:49.847 --> 22:51.983
Aye, ma'am.

22:52.049 --> 22:54.586
Samperio, the moment
those things move away

22:54.652 --> 22:56.221
from the Chinese,
we fire on 'em!

22:56.288 --> 22:57.788
Yes, ma'am!

22:57.855 --> 22:59.800
I can't imagine they still think
we're responsible for this mess.

22:59.824 --> 23:01.593
Ma'am?

23:01.659 --> 23:02.927
Yes, tuan.

23:02.994 --> 23:05.062
They stopped attacking
the Chinese ship.

23:14.939 --> 23:16.642
Looks like they
sustained some damage,

23:16.707 --> 23:18.443
but they aren't totally sunk.

23:18.510 --> 23:19.977
I'm not sure, ma'am.

23:20.044 --> 23:23.714
The sharks dropped fast
like something hurt them or...

23:23.781 --> 23:25.901
Or they're regrouping and
looking for a better target.

23:27.685 --> 23:29.254
Confirming the sharks
are in sight

23:29.321 --> 23:31.064
and out of the danger zone
for the Chinese, ma'am.

23:31.088 --> 23:33.192
Samperio, let 'em
get a little closer

23:33.258 --> 23:35.561
and hit 'em all at once
nice and fast.

23:35.627 --> 23:36.894
<i>Turn that tide!</i>

23:36.961 --> 23:38.095
Yes, ma'am!

23:38.162 --> 23:40.164
Hold your fire until my Mark.

23:41.633 --> 23:43.076
<i>They're just a
few hundred feet out, captain!</i>

23:43.100 --> 23:44.100
Wilco?

23:44.135 --> 23:45.736
Put tuan on the comms
to the Chinese!

23:45.803 --> 23:47.439
Yes, ma'am.

23:47.506 --> 23:49.874
Tuan, inform the Chinese
that we will be firing,

23:49.941 --> 23:51.276
but not on them.

23:51.343 --> 23:52.477
Yes, ma'am.

23:52.544 --> 23:53.744
<i>Here they come!</i>

23:55.214 --> 23:56.415
Hold.

23:58.383 --> 23:59.917
Hold!

23:59.984 --> 24:02.254
<i>- Now!
- Open fire!</i>

24:02.321 --> 24:04.021
Fire! Fire! Fire!

24:12.163 --> 24:14.865
They're gone again, captain.

24:14.932 --> 24:16.301
Hold fire, samperio!

24:16.368 --> 24:19.371
Hold fire! Hold fire!
Hold your fire!

24:21.005 --> 24:22.807
What's the status
of the megs, tuan?

24:22.873 --> 24:27.312
It appears they've gone deep,
captain, maybe under the shelf.

24:27.379 --> 24:29.648
They're tough, but they
don't like being shot at.

24:29.715 --> 24:31.115
Readings are unclear,

24:31.183 --> 24:33.851
but they appear
to still be in the area.

24:33.918 --> 24:35.152
So they're hiding.

24:35.220 --> 24:36.622
It would seem so, ma'am.

24:36.688 --> 24:39.056
If they're hiding and
not just running away,

24:39.123 --> 24:40.834
that means they're coming back
the moment they recover

24:40.858 --> 24:42.194
from that first shelling.

24:42.261 --> 24:44.962
They're toying
with us like cats.

24:45.029 --> 24:47.266
Killian, what's the status
of the Chinese ship?

24:47.332 --> 24:50.469
Definitely taking
water, captain.

24:50.535 --> 24:52.271
Tuan and Wilco, radio them

24:52.337 --> 24:53.914
and see if they're ready
to receive assistance.

24:53.938 --> 24:56.140
Yes, ma'am.

24:56.208 --> 24:57.676
We don't need to make friends,

24:57.743 --> 24:58.952
but I'd like to get
outta here without starting

24:58.976 --> 25:00.379
a world war if possible.

25:00.445 --> 25:01.879
Yes, ma'am.

25:01.946 --> 25:06.451
Cns tsai, this is ss king.
Do you copy? Over.

25:06.518 --> 25:08.520
Cns tsai, this is ss king.

25:08.587 --> 25:10.121
Do you copy? Over.

25:10.188 --> 25:11.699
If we don't hear anything
from them in two minutes,

25:11.723 --> 25:13.100
- we're heading out.
- All right, ma'am.

25:13.124 --> 25:14.693
Any status on the survivor?

25:14.760 --> 25:15.793
Still unconscious.

25:15.860 --> 25:17.028
Are you sure?

25:17.094 --> 25:18.996
Positive, captain.

25:19.063 --> 25:21.233
I'm getting
nothing back, captain.

25:24.503 --> 25:25.504
That's long enough.

25:26.638 --> 25:28.640
Captain, we have
a response text.

25:28.707 --> 25:31.410
Only elf.

25:31.476 --> 25:33.345
What is it?

25:33.412 --> 25:34.746
He wants a parlay.

25:34.812 --> 25:37.882
You and a comms man
and no one else.

25:40.851 --> 25:43.988
We are under no obligation to
accede to any terms, captain.

25:44.055 --> 25:45.557
I'm not acceding anything.

25:45.624 --> 25:49.494
I'm saving lives on two ships,
300 souls at least.

25:49.561 --> 25:51.929
That is my obligation
and my code.

25:51.996 --> 25:53.365
What is yours?

25:54.433 --> 25:55.634
Yes, ma'am.

25:55.701 --> 25:57.101
Clear the bridge!

25:59.904 --> 26:03.140
We have a secure line, captain.

26:08.079 --> 26:09.481
Hello, captain.

26:09.548 --> 26:14.051
I don't believe
I know your name.

26:14.118 --> 26:16.053
Captain ping is my name.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.956
Good to meet you.
I'm captain lynch.

26:19.023 --> 26:21.025
I hope you and
your crew are doing well.

26:24.061 --> 26:26.163
We're not, captain.

26:26.231 --> 26:28.866
We have been attacked.

26:28.933 --> 26:30.067
<i>Yes, we saw.</i>

26:30.134 --> 26:31.479
We tried to assist,
but were afraid

26:31.503 --> 26:35.973
of further mistakenly
damaging your ship.

26:36.040 --> 26:37.875
Your lack of action
is tantamount to an attack

26:37.942 --> 26:39.644
on us and our mission, captain.

26:39.711 --> 26:43.448
We did not sic sharks
on your ship, captain!

26:43.515 --> 26:46.385
That is not
what the U.S. Navy does!

26:46.451 --> 26:48.253
We have heard otherwise
from the Russians.

26:51.088 --> 26:53.991
We have saved the Russians.

26:54.058 --> 26:56.828
If you've heard anything
but that, you've heard wrong.

26:56.894 --> 26:59.798
There's nothing that can stop
us from our missions, captain.

26:59.865 --> 27:02.567
Your mission?

27:02.634 --> 27:04.269
Yes.

27:04.336 --> 27:06.772
You should not underestimate
the situation

27:06.838 --> 27:08.640
we are in here, captain ping.

27:08.707 --> 27:10.876
We don't know when those
things will come back.

27:10.941 --> 27:14.078
Now I can offer you safe harbor

27:14.145 --> 27:16.113
and provide you transport
until such time as...

27:16.181 --> 27:18.216
We must complete our mission.

27:18.283 --> 27:21.353
I should hope
that your mission would be

27:21.420 --> 27:23.422
to save your ship and
your crew, captain ping!

27:23.488 --> 27:26.758
Now, like I said,
I can provide you

27:26.825 --> 27:28.926
harbor and offer you transport.

27:28.993 --> 27:33.030
Captain lynch, I told you
we must complete our missions.

27:33.097 --> 27:34.766
<i>You have two hours
to return our survivor</i>

27:34.833 --> 27:36.468
<i>and depart these waters.</i>

27:36.535 --> 27:40.439
Well, I don't take orders from
anyone but the U.S. government.

27:40.505 --> 27:43.642
Added to that,
you are in our waters,

27:43.708 --> 27:46.378
30 nautical miles off
the coast of San Diego.

27:46.445 --> 27:49.146
So I'll be taking orders
from my admiral.

27:49.214 --> 27:51.917
But I will pass on
your request to him.

27:51.982 --> 27:54.151
You have two hours.

27:55.220 --> 27:56.621
Get him back, Wilco!

27:56.688 --> 27:58.223
Yes, ma'am.

27:59.825 --> 28:03.060
I didn't believe those
stories about the sharks.

28:03.127 --> 28:05.029
I thought people were
just messing around.

28:05.095 --> 28:06.832
If they keep coming
at us like that...

28:06.898 --> 28:09.166
We're gonna kick their ass!
That's what we're gonna do.

28:09.234 --> 28:12.002
- Back to your stations, people!
- Yes, ma'am!

28:12.069 --> 28:13.146
We have to keep
those things away

28:13.170 --> 28:14.539
from San Diego, no matter what!

28:14.606 --> 28:15.917
Do you mean the sharks
or the tsai, ma'am?

28:15.941 --> 28:17.309
Both, tuan.

28:17.375 --> 28:18.910
Be ready for a show
of force, people!

28:18.976 --> 28:21.246
- Yes, captain!
- Yes, captain!

28:21.313 --> 28:22.347
Ahearn?

28:24.182 --> 28:26.218
- Ahearn?
- Yes, ma'am?

28:26.284 --> 28:28.420
What's the status
of our survivor?

28:28.487 --> 28:30.422
Well, we...

28:30.489 --> 28:33.023
She's awake, ma'am.

28:33.090 --> 28:34.726
I was gonna say just that.

28:34.793 --> 28:36.994
She's awake, captain.

28:37.061 --> 28:38.430
Hold the bridge, ahearn.

28:38.497 --> 28:40.064
Yes, captain.

28:45.403 --> 28:48.473
Those sharks attacked your ship

28:48.540 --> 28:50.342
and killed your crew,
didn't they?

28:54.846 --> 28:56.381
What's your name?

28:59.751 --> 29:03.622
Well, I don't know
if you speak English,

29:03.688 --> 29:06.858
but if you do, you should know
we're getting ready to engage

29:06.925 --> 29:08.260
with a Chinese destroyer

29:08.326 --> 29:10.295
that's demanding
we turn you over to them.

29:11.830 --> 29:14.833
What that means is,
we cannot move from this spot

29:14.900 --> 29:17.536
without maybe starting a war.

29:17.602 --> 29:19.337
We're sitting here waiting
to be lunch

29:19.404 --> 29:21.506
for three giant sharks
that will return the moment

29:21.573 --> 29:24.009
that they recover from
their last shelling.

29:24.074 --> 29:25.577
So I hope you don't
speak English

29:25.644 --> 29:28.213
and I hope you're not purposely
sitting on information

29:28.280 --> 29:30.215
that will be the difference
between two ships

29:30.282 --> 29:32.484
worth of people living
or dying here today!

29:34.151 --> 29:35.387
I hope for everyone's sake

29:35.453 --> 29:37.093
that all I need to
do right now is go down

29:37.154 --> 29:38.723
and get my translator!

29:40.090 --> 29:42.159
My name's Dr. Lee

29:43.194 --> 29:44.696
and their armada
is coming for me.

29:45.964 --> 29:47.164
They know about the megalodons

29:47.198 --> 29:48.700
and have been
waiting on standby.

29:50.001 --> 29:52.404
That's why the ships
have been circling.

29:52.470 --> 29:54.506
I knew it wasn't for transit.

29:56.073 --> 29:57.742
The first ship
is just a warning.

30:02.314 --> 30:04.916
They've recovered!

30:04.983 --> 30:06.785
Keep her here, Dr. Ray.

30:06.851 --> 30:08.453
Brace yourselves.

30:10.822 --> 30:12.691
Fire! Fire! Fire!

30:21.566 --> 30:23.301
Hell, yeah! Good shot, boys!

30:23.368 --> 30:25.102
One hell of a shot!

30:32.944 --> 30:35.614
The the Americans are
firing into the water.

30:35.680 --> 30:38.550
I don't think they're lying,
about the sharks, sir.

30:38.617 --> 30:42.220
They're fighting them
just like we are...

30:42.287 --> 30:44.022
Should we depart, sir?

30:44.089 --> 30:47.826
Or should we wait for
the armada, sir?

30:51.930 --> 30:53.832
We wait.

30:56.868 --> 30:57.869
Yes, sir.

31:08.380 --> 31:10.248
We have a message
already prepared for you,

31:10.315 --> 31:12.384
captain, both in English
and mandarin.

31:12.450 --> 31:14.386
Read it back to me.

31:14.452 --> 31:17.489
Communication from captain lynch
to captain ping.

31:17.555 --> 31:19.724
"At this time after
the near destruction

31:19.791 --> 31:23.028
"of your ship and the imminent
destruction of mine,

31:23.094 --> 31:24.396
"we are in preparations
to return

31:24.462 --> 31:26.798
"to San Diego naval base
where the survivor

31:26.865 --> 31:28.033
"will be taken care of.

31:28.099 --> 31:30.035
"And we will work
through diplomatic channels

31:30.101 --> 31:31.403
"to get her back home.

31:31.469 --> 31:34.673
"We cannot take the time
to transfer personnel

31:34.739 --> 31:37.242
"or otherwise engage
without further endangering

31:37.308 --> 31:39.110
"lives in the face
of the megalodons.

31:39.177 --> 31:41.379
"And while what
is clearly damaged

31:41.446 --> 31:43.748
"and appears to be being
devoured as we speak,

31:43.815 --> 31:45.650
"this present calm
will not last.

31:45.717 --> 31:48.386
"Our offer is not
an act of hostility

31:48.453 --> 31:49.921
"and should not be
taken as such.

31:49.988 --> 31:53.158
"It is an offer of assistance
and safe harbor.

31:53.224 --> 31:54.626
"If you accompany
us to the harbor,

31:54.693 --> 31:57.128
"we guarantee the safe return
of personnel.

31:57.195 --> 31:59.297
Regards, captain lynch."

32:00.565 --> 32:01.700
Send it.

32:03.334 --> 32:05.103
Give me the P.A., Wilco.

32:05.170 --> 32:08.139
Yes, ma'am. On your comms now.

32:08.206 --> 32:10.809
<i>Crew, this is
your captain speaking.</i>

32:10.875 --> 32:13.179
I have been informed
that a Chinese armada

32:13.244 --> 32:14.746
will be approaching us.

32:14.813 --> 32:17.183
Report any and all
new sightings of new ships

32:17.248 --> 32:19.284
on the horizon
to myself and your xo.

32:19.350 --> 32:21.119
Thank you.

32:21.187 --> 32:22.496
Is that really happening,
captain?

32:22.520 --> 32:25.023
A Chinese armada?

32:25.090 --> 32:27.358
Yes, and we have to be prepared.

32:27.425 --> 32:28.985
And even more prepared
when those things

32:29.027 --> 32:30.528
finish eating their friend.

32:30.595 --> 32:32.764
And I have a sense that
it's not gonna satiate them.

32:32.831 --> 32:34.265
On the move, people!

32:34.332 --> 32:35.967
- Asap! Now!
- You heard the captain!

32:36.034 --> 32:37.034
Asap! Let's go!

32:53.084 --> 32:54.285
That was close, captain.

32:54.352 --> 32:56.254
A warning shot from the Chinese?

32:56.321 --> 32:58.089
We have incoming comms, captain.

32:58.156 --> 33:00.592
Putting tuan on now.

33:00.658 --> 33:02.327
They're saying if we move,

33:02.393 --> 33:04.162
it will be perceived
as an act of war.

33:04.230 --> 33:05.764
They're firing on us!

33:05.830 --> 33:07.132
Stop the ship.

33:07.199 --> 33:09.201
They're damaged, ma'am.
We can take them!

33:09.267 --> 33:10.535
<i>Should we engage, ma'am?</i>

33:10.602 --> 33:11.970
Be ready to, samperio!

33:12.036 --> 33:14.206
We may not have a choice
if they keep firing on us.

33:14.272 --> 33:16.208
We're all set, captain!

33:16.274 --> 33:18.777
Wilco? Raise admiral green.

33:18.843 --> 33:19.778
Yes, ma'am.

33:19.844 --> 33:21.713
He may not want
to hear about this,

33:21.780 --> 33:24.382
but he'll damn sure want to hear
about the Chinese firing on us.

33:25.650 --> 33:28.353
Ahearn, go talk to Dr. Lee.

33:28.419 --> 33:31.356
Captain, I'm sorry,
but who is Dr. Lee?

33:31.422 --> 33:34.926
Our survivor. Find out what she
was really doing here, ahearn.

33:34.993 --> 33:37.996
If we know that, we'll have
an idea how to stop this war.

33:38.062 --> 33:39.297
Yes, ma'am.

33:39.364 --> 33:41.233
Wilco?
Do you have admiral green?

33:41.299 --> 33:42.700
Not yet, ma'am.

33:42.767 --> 33:45.237
Admiral green is still
in talks with the Chinese.

33:45.303 --> 33:47.572
He's on his jets and...

33:47.639 --> 33:51.743
Everyone with a pay grade
has their asses covered.

33:51.810 --> 33:53.311
Understood.

33:53.378 --> 33:55.046
I think it's time
I phone a friend.

33:57.782 --> 33:59.026
We don't know
where these things are.

33:59.050 --> 34:00.752
We could use some eyes
in the sky.

34:00.819 --> 34:02.264
We're sitting ducks
and the other ducks

34:02.288 --> 34:03.454
are taking pot shots at us!

34:03.521 --> 34:05.123
I'm already on my way.

34:05.191 --> 34:07.792
What? What does that mean?
I thought you were grounded?

34:07.859 --> 34:11.029
Oh, I am,
but my underwater drone isn't.

34:12.931 --> 34:14.866
I put it in the water
the second our call ended.

34:14.933 --> 34:17.068
It's already 29 miles out
from shore,

34:17.135 --> 34:19.113
which means we should be in
your neck of the woods in about,

34:19.137 --> 34:22.640
I don't know, 20 seconds.

34:22.707 --> 34:24.475
You know if the admiral
hears about this...

34:24.542 --> 34:25.910
It'll be a bloodbath,
figuratively.

34:25.977 --> 34:28.680
But I'm concerned about
the literal bloodbath

34:28.746 --> 34:31.983
that will occur
if I don't do this.

34:32.050 --> 34:34.220
I can take the consequences,
but all the same,

34:34.286 --> 34:37.589
keep this under wraps with
your crew, if you will, captain.

34:37.655 --> 34:39.133
Loose lips...
Well, you know the rest.

34:39.157 --> 34:40.959
Your secret's safe with me,
commander.

34:41.025 --> 34:44.362
Good...

34:44.429 --> 34:45.864
Because here we are.

34:52.837 --> 34:55.640
Look at the size of this thing.

34:57.176 --> 34:59.043
We'll have to get around it

34:59.110 --> 35:03.014
and get a picture of
the bigger one, too.

35:03.081 --> 35:04.582
Salles!

35:06.484 --> 35:08.019
What's the status
of the megs, tuan?

35:08.086 --> 35:10.322
Looks like they're just
getting on the move again,

35:10.388 --> 35:13.259
not coming on strong.

35:13.325 --> 35:16.160
Maybe we put them on notice
again with the last volley.

35:16.228 --> 35:17.795
That's almost good news.

35:17.862 --> 35:20.999
Or they're finishing their
last meal and biding their time.

35:21.065 --> 35:26.738
That's more what I'm used to.

35:26.804 --> 35:29.440
Uh, captain, one
of the megs is...

35:29.507 --> 35:30.575
What?

35:30.642 --> 35:31.943
Distracted.

35:32.010 --> 35:35.381
Good. Wilco?
Any news on the admiral yet?

35:35.446 --> 35:36.714
Getting word now, ma'am.

35:36.781 --> 35:38.516
We're being told
to hold our ground.

35:38.583 --> 35:40.386
Hold our ground?

35:40.451 --> 35:41.819
Wilco, do you have the admiral?

35:41.886 --> 35:44.223
No, ma'am. Support staff only.

35:44.290 --> 35:46.392
Admiral's in negotiations.

35:46.457 --> 35:47.992
What would you like
us to do, ma'am?

35:48.059 --> 35:50.094
If they move any closer,
hit 'em with all we got.

35:50.161 --> 35:53.097
Hard, fast, all at once,
just like the last time.

35:53.164 --> 35:54.875
We will not move,
but we will not be sitting here

35:54.899 --> 35:56.434
like wounded deer either.

35:56.501 --> 35:59.137
We have a duty to protect
ourselves and the other ship!

35:59.204 --> 36:00.705
Yes, ma'am.

36:00.772 --> 36:02.840
Come on, boys! Let's go!
Let's go! Come on!

36:09.514 --> 36:10.682
Sorry, commander.

36:10.748 --> 36:12.583
Every time I get close
to the big one,

36:12.650 --> 36:14.253
the small one
blocks off my path.

36:14.320 --> 36:15.687
Yeah.

36:15.753 --> 36:18.556
That mini Meg is trying
to protect that big beast,

36:18.623 --> 36:20.458
running interference
for it like a yappy dog.

36:20.525 --> 36:21.759
You know what that means?

36:21.826 --> 36:23.161
No, sir.

36:23.228 --> 36:26.332
It means the beast is in charge.

36:26.398 --> 36:28.334
Punch through, salles.

36:28.400 --> 36:31.437
I'm trying to, sir,
but that small one's fast.

36:31.502 --> 36:33.972
Move over. I'm driving.

36:34.038 --> 36:35.207
Yes, sir.

36:50.289 --> 36:55.793
You know, I wanted to catch
you before captain did,

36:55.860 --> 36:57.528
but I missed my opportunity.

36:58.796 --> 37:01.966
Here's what you should know.

37:02.033 --> 37:04.702
She's a good woman, she is,

37:04.769 --> 37:08.207
a fair woman, the captain.

37:08.273 --> 37:10.442
She believes that...

37:10.508 --> 37:15.180
Everyone is important, even you,

37:15.247 --> 37:18.250
a Chinese spy...

37:18.317 --> 37:21.552
Floating around American waters.

37:25.690 --> 37:29.527
But see, I'm not like
my captain, though.

37:29.594 --> 37:32.697
I'm not, hmm?

37:32.764 --> 37:37.702
I'm what you call
a natural born warrior

37:37.769 --> 37:42.307
and I for one hate my enemy.

37:43.908 --> 37:46.412
And make no mistake about it.

37:46.478 --> 37:50.081
You are my enemy, hmm?

37:52.217 --> 37:56.188
See, I'm supposed
to come down here,

37:56.255 --> 38:00.359
try to get you to offer up
your precious spy information.

38:00.426 --> 38:06.265
But, you know, I'm glad
you're not cooperating.

38:06.331 --> 38:09.301
I am, I really am.

38:09.368 --> 38:14.273
Because I'm going to enjoy
throwing you in those waters.

38:14.339 --> 38:18.709
And watching those sharks
tear you limb from limb,

38:18.776 --> 38:23.549
giving us just
enough time to escape.

38:23.614 --> 38:28.753
See, make no mistake about it.

38:28.820 --> 38:33.057
No matter what deal
you get offered,

38:33.124 --> 38:34.859
that's how this ends for you.

38:36.160 --> 38:37.161
You hear me?

38:37.229 --> 38:39.364
Any luck, ahearn?

38:39.431 --> 38:41.366
Not so far, ma'am.

38:41.433 --> 38:43.202
I don't think her
English is so good.

38:43.268 --> 38:44.635
Hmm.

38:44.702 --> 38:45.937
Why don't you take the bridge,

38:46.003 --> 38:48.873
see how we're
doing with those sharks.

38:48.940 --> 38:51.210
Dr. Ray, if you don't
mind stepping out?

38:51.276 --> 38:52.977
Yes, ma'am.

38:53.044 --> 38:55.646
Lee and I need to
do a one-on-one.

39:18.035 --> 39:20.239
I know you can understand me.

39:20.305 --> 39:22.274
But maybe you're afraid
you said too much

39:22.341 --> 39:24.209
the first time we spoke.

39:24.276 --> 39:27.778
But the megs
are coming at us now.

39:27.845 --> 39:30.148
We would be happy to take
you to the other ship.

39:30.215 --> 39:33.185
I will do it myself
in a dinghy if I have to.

39:33.252 --> 39:37.088
But I must know what you
were doing in these waters!

39:38.823 --> 39:41.226
I already know it
must be a spy mission.

39:41.293 --> 39:43.195
But I need to
know more than that.

39:43.262 --> 39:45.763
So here it is.

39:45.830 --> 39:48.433
You either tell me
what I need to know

39:49.934 --> 39:52.003
or we all die with
our secrets here today.

39:56.774 --> 39:58.510
More power, salles!

39:58.577 --> 40:00.279
We're almost
there, we're almost...

40:10.054 --> 40:13.425
Dr. Ray, take Lee to the brig.

40:13.492 --> 40:14.859
Aye, ma'am.

40:17.862 --> 40:19.264
All right.

40:33.178 --> 40:36.515
The moment that big one
comes anywhere near the surface,

40:36.582 --> 40:37.949
drop a bomb on its ass!

40:38.816 --> 40:42.153
Where are they?

40:42.221 --> 40:43.888
They're on the move
again, captain.

40:43.955 --> 40:45.957
Back to the tsai?

40:46.023 --> 40:49.894
No, ma'am, away from it,
moving fast.

40:49.961 --> 40:51.896
What? Where are they going?

40:55.434 --> 40:57.735
Moore! It worked!

40:57.802 --> 40:58.903
It worked too well.

40:58.970 --> 41:01.138
What? What do you mean?

41:01.206 --> 41:04.809
My drone got 'em nice and mad
and dragged them away from you.

41:04.875 --> 41:09.947
But they seemed to have realized
there's nothing to eat in it...

41:10.014 --> 41:12.718
What do you mean, eat, sir?

41:12.783 --> 41:16.355
They're close enough
to smell the cotton candy,

41:16.421 --> 41:19.090
so they're heading
for San Diego.

41:19.156 --> 41:21.526
They're heading for us.

41:21.593 --> 41:23.462
Isn't that great?

41:30.636 --> 41:33.137
We've got to do something.

41:33.205 --> 41:35.006
You can't go out there,
commander Moore!

41:38.075 --> 41:39.378
Hell if I won't.

41:40.911 --> 41:44.616
If you go out there, you'll
end up in the stockade, sir.

41:44.683 --> 41:48.287
If we don't stop those things
from destroying our ships,

41:48.353 --> 41:51.623
we can't stop the armada
from storming our shores.

41:51.690 --> 41:53.501
We'll be sitting ducks for
whatever comes for us!

41:53.525 --> 41:58.630
And I will not stay in here
and do nothing.

41:58.697 --> 42:00.064
That's why you won't.

42:03.368 --> 42:07.506
We need your eyes here
helping guide us.

42:07.572 --> 42:11.443
You keep in contact with me,
you'll see what I see.

42:11.510 --> 42:13.010
You'll be with us.

42:14.212 --> 42:15.523
Look, I don't consider
it an upside,

42:15.547 --> 42:17.783
but if those
things do attack the beach,

42:17.848 --> 42:19.850
no one can deny that they exist.

42:19.917 --> 42:21.586
And I'll get footage of it all.

42:26.625 --> 42:29.528
You're a good man, salles,
you're a good man.

42:29.594 --> 42:30.594
There you go.

42:32.297 --> 42:35.200
And you're my commander, sir,
no matter what they say.

42:36.133 --> 42:38.102
There's no way I can stop them,

42:38.169 --> 42:42.940
but I'll get all
the evidence we need.

42:43.007 --> 42:45.076
Just in case...
Let's blow up some fish.

42:46.411 --> 42:48.846
<i>Salles, paccom says our
carriers are tied up</i>

42:48.913 --> 42:51.683
<i>with the Chinese Navy, so air
support is not available.</i>

42:51.750 --> 42:53.185
First platoon one me!

42:53.251 --> 42:55.152
Second platoon, clear that pier!

42:56.921 --> 43:02.093
Destroy those things before
they hit the beaches, salles!

43:02.159 --> 43:03.094
Let's go! I got eyes on!

43:03.160 --> 43:04.830
We're clear.

43:04.895 --> 43:07.566
<i>Coast guard is still enroute.
You gotta hold 'em off!</i>

43:07.632 --> 43:08.899
Fire!

43:18.109 --> 43:21.078
Fall back, salles! Fall back!

43:22.913 --> 43:24.383
Gah! Go!

43:24.449 --> 43:26.451
First platoon, fall back,
fall back!

43:26.518 --> 43:27.918
<i>Let's go!</i>

43:27.985 --> 43:30.921
Ma'am, the megalodons have
decimated the San Diego base

43:30.988 --> 43:32.791
and are approaching the beaches.

43:32.858 --> 43:34.959
I'm going to see Dr. Lee.

43:36.228 --> 43:38.430
Captain?

43:38.497 --> 43:41.065
Should I have Wilco and
tuan contact the tsai?

43:42.501 --> 43:43.702
For what reason, ahearn?

43:43.769 --> 43:47.239
Captain, she is a spy.

43:50.375 --> 43:53.144
Are you suggesting
we throw her overboard?

43:53.211 --> 43:54.579
Make her walk the plank?

43:54.646 --> 43:56.348
Is that what you want us to do?

43:58.015 --> 43:59.518
No, ma'am, not at all.

43:59.584 --> 44:00.786
Good.

44:00.852 --> 44:03.255
Because that's not how
the U.S. Navy operates.

44:03.321 --> 44:05.757
And that's not
how my ship operates.

44:05.824 --> 44:08.527
And it is indeed my ship,
lieutenant commander!

44:08.593 --> 44:10.695
We do not throw
inconvenient people

44:10.762 --> 44:12.631
into shark-infested waters!

44:12.697 --> 44:14.932
If we were to defy
orders and cut Dr. Lee

44:14.999 --> 44:18.637
before knowing what she knows,
we would be defying orders.

44:18.703 --> 44:22.106
And that's not the captain I am
nor is it the captain I will be,

44:22.173 --> 44:23.484
no matter what
the circumstances are

44:23.508 --> 44:25.142
or what arguments
have been made!

44:25.210 --> 44:27.945
I follow orders
and so should you!

44:29.448 --> 44:31.650
Yes, captain. Understood.

44:32.950 --> 44:34.453
Now let's go break
this woman down

44:34.519 --> 44:37.255
and find out what she knows
so we can get outta here.

44:55.907 --> 44:57.576
Thank you, ahearn.

44:59.878 --> 45:02.146
You don't need my help, captain?

45:02.214 --> 45:04.683
You've done exactly what I need.

45:04.749 --> 45:07.786
Return to the bridge.
Take the con.

45:07.853 --> 45:09.488
Yes, captain.

45:18.663 --> 45:19.931
What are you doing?

45:19.997 --> 45:22.267
He wants to throw you
in the water.

45:23.768 --> 45:27.539
He hasn't said it to me,
but he's ready to do it.

45:27.606 --> 45:30.475
I think a lot of people on this
ship are ready to do it as well,

45:32.844 --> 45:34.913
but I'm in charge.

45:34.980 --> 45:36.181
And I want to send you home,

45:36.248 --> 45:38.048
but we're running
out of options.

45:40.585 --> 45:43.922
I'm not afraid to die
for my country, captain lynch.

45:43.989 --> 45:45.357
I am.

45:46.791 --> 45:48.025
Please.

46:01.239 --> 46:04.809
That doesn't mean
I won't do it, but I am.

46:06.278 --> 46:08.179
I'm willing to kill
for my country, too.

46:11.583 --> 46:15.387
But I'm not willing
to sacrifice my honor for it.

46:15.453 --> 46:16.931
Are you willing
to sacrifice your honor

46:16.955 --> 46:18.323
for your country, Dr. Lee?

46:20.258 --> 46:22.761
Because the way
I see it, without honor,

46:22.827 --> 46:26.598
we don't have a country
or a society.

46:26.665 --> 46:28.165
We only have ourselves.

46:30.535 --> 46:35.440
I would die to protect
my country's secrets.

46:35.507 --> 46:38.476
But I will not die
to protect its lies.

46:38.543 --> 46:42.781
A country's lies are a weapon
to be used against its country.

46:42.847 --> 46:45.550
If we make them our lies,

46:45.617 --> 46:48.420
we become weapons
against our own country.

46:49.854 --> 46:52.357
Now something happened here

46:52.424 --> 46:58.263
and it brought those sharks
in like a revenge of sin.

46:58.330 --> 47:00.465
Do you believe in luck, Dr. Lee?

47:02.099 --> 47:03.335
I do.

47:03.401 --> 47:04.569
Do you believe in bad luck?

47:07.505 --> 47:08.607
I do.

47:10.875 --> 47:14.446
Well, bad luck doesn't
usually follow bad action.

47:14.512 --> 47:16.715
But when it does,
it's the worst kind,

47:16.781 --> 47:19.684
the kind that erases
all the good we ever did.

47:31.496 --> 47:34.633
Salles, I need a status report.

47:36.001 --> 47:37.669
Talk to me.

47:37.736 --> 47:40.372
Moore, sir,
we were firing, but we lost 'em!

47:40.438 --> 47:42.172
They tore apart both docks

47:42.240 --> 47:44.275
and hulled the vitus
and both battleships!

47:44.342 --> 47:46.177
<i>The naval base is
completely destroyed.</i>

47:46.244 --> 47:48.145
Get to the beaches, salles.

47:48.213 --> 47:51.816
Please get to the beaches now.

47:51.883 --> 47:53.251
Oh, my god!

48:00.925 --> 48:04.496
I understand
what you're saying, captain,

48:04.562 --> 48:07.198
but I'm not going
to betray my country.

48:11.269 --> 48:12.804
There is nothing to betray.

48:14.372 --> 48:15.907
We know your team was spying.

48:15.974 --> 48:20.011
There is no other reason you
were here in the U.S. waters.

48:20.078 --> 48:23.882
You're a scientist,
so you must have developed

48:23.948 --> 48:26.751
a technology to do that spying.

48:26.818 --> 48:29.721
And, well, we know
something exists.

48:29.788 --> 48:31.289
And it's really only
a matter of time

48:31.356 --> 48:33.291
until we realize what it is.

48:35.794 --> 48:39.597
And every second
we waste here in this room,

48:39.664 --> 48:41.566
it's another life on the line.

48:43.802 --> 48:48.006
A child, a parent,
a soldier in San Diego?

48:48.073 --> 48:51.609
Help me save those lives
you put into harm's way!

48:53.845 --> 48:56.881
And I'll do whatever I have
to do to make this go away!

48:56.948 --> 48:58.817
But there
are people dying, Dr. Lee!

49:13.932 --> 49:16.568
Get your officers
to clear the beach!

49:16.634 --> 49:19.003
Get your officers to clear
that beach and do it now!

49:19.070 --> 49:22.273
<i>You saw the video we sent,
you need to act now!</i>

49:22.340 --> 49:24.176
<i>This is the United States
coast guard!</i>

49:24.242 --> 49:27.445
<i>All citizens must evacuated
the beaches immediately.</i>

49:27.512 --> 49:29.380
Get everyone off the beach!

49:32.717 --> 49:35.920
Help me save
those people, Dr. Lee.

49:40.859 --> 49:41.859
All right.

49:43.094 --> 49:44.496
All right.

49:48.032 --> 49:51.669
We were acquiring information.

49:54.873 --> 49:55.873
You were hacking.

49:57.942 --> 49:59.043
Satellites.

49:59.110 --> 50:00.745
Our technology.

50:03.249 --> 50:05.251
It drew the megalodons to us.

50:05.316 --> 50:08.787
It's the sound, I believe.

50:13.358 --> 50:16.427
And can we retrieve it?
Is it still on the ship?

50:19.364 --> 50:20.932
No need to retrieve it.

50:24.335 --> 50:25.904
What do you mean?

50:40.286 --> 50:41.820
We could...

50:42.787 --> 50:47.058
We could save those people...

50:47.125 --> 50:49.627
If you let me help you.

51:08.646 --> 51:10.515
The beam is deadly
to most sea creatures.

51:10.582 --> 51:12.150
The sound-wave, in fact,

51:12.218 --> 51:15.187
dis-equilibrates their swim
bladders and even burst them.

51:15.254 --> 51:16.521
But not the sharks?

51:16.588 --> 51:18.056
Not with this power level.

51:18.122 --> 51:21.059
It is possible that it
can damage their inner ears

51:21.125 --> 51:24.796
enough to confuse them with
enough of a pulse, enough time.

51:24.863 --> 51:26.831
Sharks hear much
lower than we do.

51:26.898 --> 51:30.401
This, we believe, is why
they respond to the beamformer.

51:30.468 --> 51:33.104
When you say respond,
you mean it calls them?

51:33.171 --> 51:34.372
And makes them angry.

51:35.241 --> 51:36.641
Wilco?

51:36.708 --> 51:39.677
Can we hook this up to
the P.A. and radio system?

51:39.744 --> 51:43.615
I think I can figure
something out, captain.

51:43.681 --> 51:45.984
But I have no idea
how this works.

51:46.050 --> 51:48.720
Oh. Lee will help you.

51:48.786 --> 51:50.989
Won't you, Dr. Lee?

51:51.055 --> 51:52.624
I will.

51:52.690 --> 51:55.526
Captain, a word, please?

51:55.593 --> 51:57.528
You're worried, ahearn.

51:57.595 --> 51:59.731
I do not trust this woman.

51:59.797 --> 52:03.801
Nor should you, but she's
who we need right now.

52:03.868 --> 52:06.404
Without her, a lot
more people in San Diego die.

52:06.471 --> 52:08.940
We gotta call those sharks
back from the San Diego line.

52:09.007 --> 52:10.975
Understood.

52:11.042 --> 52:13.811
Ahearn, you are the most
intelligent, capable officer

52:13.878 --> 52:15.480
I've ever worked with.

52:15.546 --> 52:17.782
I need you to be exactly
who you are

52:17.849 --> 52:19.484
while still doing
what needs to get done.

52:19.550 --> 52:20.685
Understand?

52:20.752 --> 52:22.453
Understood, captain.

52:22.520 --> 52:24.256
Good man.

52:24.323 --> 52:25.924
Keep an eye on the tsai for me.

52:25.990 --> 52:27.293
I'll be on this.

52:27.359 --> 52:28.860
Understood, ma'am.

52:31.330 --> 52:33.097
Are we ready?

52:33.164 --> 52:36.368
Uh, we're having
to cross-strap a lot of stuff.

52:36.434 --> 52:38.169
Will we be ready soon?

52:38.237 --> 52:39.837
We will.

52:41.572 --> 52:42.840
Samperio?

52:42.907 --> 52:45.109
If what Lee says is correct,

52:45.177 --> 52:47.712
those things will be
coming in hot and confused.

52:47.779 --> 52:50.548
Ready your team to blow
the last two out of the water.

52:50.615 --> 52:52.450
I want teeth for the hood
of my car.

52:55.720 --> 52:57.488
Of the beach!

53:05.763 --> 53:08.833
Yeah, I think...
I think we're ready, captain.

53:08.900 --> 53:10.034
All right.

53:25.317 --> 53:27.319
I don't understand
what I'm looking at here.

53:27.386 --> 53:29.821
I do.

53:29.887 --> 53:32.557
Captain, should I let
her use the terminal?

53:32.623 --> 53:35.126
Explain everything, Dr. Lee,
or it's back to the brig.

53:37.262 --> 53:39.431
We are probing for data packets.

53:39.497 --> 53:41.799
It's the only way the system
is designed to work.

53:43.534 --> 53:44.969
We have to hack.

53:45.036 --> 53:46.137
We do.

53:46.205 --> 53:48.273
Shall I tell it
to access, captain?

53:48.340 --> 53:50.242
That's the only way it
can reach enough capacity

53:50.309 --> 53:53.111
to bring the megalodons back.

53:53.178 --> 53:54.746
Yes, do it.

54:01.119 --> 54:02.053
Did it work?

54:02.120 --> 54:03.621
Something wrong?

54:03.688 --> 54:05.623
It's not connecting!

54:07.326 --> 54:08.659
I think it's out of synch.

54:08.726 --> 54:11.662
One of these connections
isn't working properly.

54:11.729 --> 54:12.730
We can patch it.

54:12.797 --> 54:14.766
No. If you patch one unit,

54:14.832 --> 54:16.244
then we have to resynch
the whole system!

54:16.268 --> 54:18.736
Whatever we need to do,
do it fast and do it now!

54:18.803 --> 54:20.538
- Let's go!
- Yes, ma'am.

54:31.582 --> 54:33.519
Salles?

54:33.584 --> 54:34.952
Salles!

54:40.124 --> 54:42.026
The tsai looks
pretty bad, captain.

54:43.661 --> 54:44.796
How long will this take?

54:45.663 --> 54:48.400
Five minutes at least!

54:48.467 --> 54:50.968
We don't have five minutes!

54:51.035 --> 54:52.703
People are dying, captain!

54:52.770 --> 54:54.339
Step off the bridge, Mr. Ahearn.

54:54.406 --> 54:55.907
We are screwing around!

54:55.973 --> 54:58.042
We should be saving lives,
not trusting our enemies!

54:58.109 --> 55:01.280
Step off the bridge!
That is an order!

55:01.346 --> 55:02.880
Aye, captain!

55:02.947 --> 55:05.750
The only enemies are
the megalodons and ourselves!

55:05.817 --> 55:07.118
That is it!

55:16.495 --> 55:17.929
No...

55:49.428 --> 55:50.695
Status?

55:50.761 --> 55:52.830
Almost there!

55:52.897 --> 55:54.433
It looks good, looks good.

55:54.500 --> 55:56.335
We're ready.

55:56.401 --> 55:57.768
Press the button, Dr. Lee.

56:02.640 --> 56:06.844
Do we need to resynch it again?

56:06.911 --> 56:09.214
It should work!
It's connected everywhere!

56:11.682 --> 56:13.784
Let me try something...

56:17.722 --> 56:19.291
I thought that would work.

56:22.528 --> 56:23.761
You're doing so good.

56:25.163 --> 56:29.201
You're like a super genius
or something, you know.

56:35.440 --> 56:37.643
Salles? Salles!

56:37.708 --> 56:40.379
Damn it, salles! Salles!

56:45.883 --> 56:47.985
Is it supposed to do this?

56:48.052 --> 56:51.256
Yes! The vibrations are low!
We can still do damage!

57:04.436 --> 57:07.071
What is the status?

57:07.138 --> 57:10.107
I believe the connections
worked, ma'am.

57:10.174 --> 57:12.877
Tuan, do you see
anything on the radar?

57:14.779 --> 57:17.748
The radar is
unresponsive, captain.

57:18.617 --> 57:20.219
Try rebooting it.

57:20.285 --> 57:21.953
Wilco, how's your terminal?

57:22.019 --> 57:24.822
Completely unresponsive
as well, ma'am.

57:24.889 --> 57:27.492
I need eyes on windows!
I need eyes everywhere!

57:32.531 --> 57:33.531
Salles?

57:48.779 --> 57:49.981
Okay.

57:55.953 --> 57:58.457
Captain, enemy ships
are approaching!

58:00.192 --> 58:01.859
Not now! Not now, damn it!

58:01.926 --> 58:04.596
Wilco! Ready the P.A. system!

58:04.663 --> 58:06.498
Yes, ma'am.

58:07.599 --> 58:08.766
Attention, all crew!

58:08.833 --> 58:09.843
Three destroyers on approach!

58:09.867 --> 58:11.603
Ready battle stations!

58:20.646 --> 58:22.046
Okay.

58:34.559 --> 58:37.061
Battle stations!
All crew to battle stations!

58:37.128 --> 58:38.863
Battle stations now!

58:38.929 --> 58:40.332
Look alive!

58:45.036 --> 58:47.639
Come on. Come on, don't do it.

58:47.706 --> 58:49.374
Do not come here now!

59:04.489 --> 59:06.023
Oh, we need more help!

59:06.090 --> 59:09.126
Ma'am, we're getting a text-only
readout from commander Moore.

59:09.194 --> 59:10.562
It's still working.

59:24.409 --> 59:25.677
What does it say?

59:25.744 --> 59:28.513
"The naval base's fleet,
is completely destroyed,

59:28.580 --> 59:30.549
but they're sending
reinforcements now."

59:30.615 --> 59:31.717
He better send them fast.

59:31.783 --> 59:33.385
Any word from admiral green?

59:33.452 --> 59:35.886
He's still talking to the
Chinese, but our orders stand.

59:35.953 --> 59:38.022
Our do-nothing orders?

59:51.403 --> 59:53.839
Are they sending anyone to us?

59:53.904 --> 59:55.106
Status quo, ma'am.

59:55.172 --> 59:57.108
The jets, they're
ready to deploy.

59:57.174 --> 59:59.009
But we don't have an update yet.

59:59.076 --> 1:00:01.646
Wire the admiral again.
We need help.

1:00:01.713 --> 1:00:03.215
Yes, ma'am.

1:00:30.842 --> 1:00:32.210
Ma'am...

1:00:50.829 --> 1:00:52.564
This is my father's knife.

1:00:52.631 --> 1:00:56.501
He carried it with him all
the way through Vietnam.

1:00:56.568 --> 1:01:01.273
But I've dishonored him and
his memory by thinking of myself

1:01:01.339 --> 1:01:04.242
instead of my crew
and my captain.

1:01:04.309 --> 1:01:08.413
If you would have me, captain,
I would like to retake my post.

1:01:12.784 --> 1:01:17.189
Permission granted, ahearn,
and not a moment too soon.

1:01:17.255 --> 1:01:18.666
We're getting ready
to join this fight.

1:01:18.690 --> 1:01:21.158
The other ships need us.

1:01:21.226 --> 1:01:22.427
Thank you, captain.

1:01:24.329 --> 1:01:26.063
Killian, get us going.

1:01:26.130 --> 1:01:27.699
Yes, ma'am.

1:01:57.796 --> 1:02:00.932
We hit the small one!
One hell of a shot, boys!

1:02:00.998 --> 1:02:03.000
Lay him up! Yeah!

1:02:10.074 --> 1:02:12.142
We're hit, men! We're hit!

1:02:12.210 --> 1:02:13.210
<i>Shoot that thing!</i>

1:02:13.245 --> 1:02:14.579
<i>Shoot that shark down now!</i>

1:02:25.122 --> 1:02:27.259
He's going down!
He's going down!

1:02:28.158 --> 1:02:30.762
The tsai put a bullet in him!

1:02:30.829 --> 1:02:33.398
Hell, yeah!

1:02:33.465 --> 1:02:35.700
Ma'am, the lower deck
tells me that

1:02:35.767 --> 1:02:37.969
they're sustaining
a lot of damage!

1:02:38.035 --> 1:02:39.271
How bad?

1:02:39.337 --> 1:02:41.171
Manageable, ma'am... they think.

1:02:41.239 --> 1:02:42.440
They're working on it now.

1:02:43.742 --> 1:02:45.510
Captain lynch! Ahead!

1:02:47.245 --> 1:02:49.414
It's coming right at us!

1:02:49.481 --> 1:02:50.682
Fire!

1:02:54.486 --> 1:02:56.888
I'm not seeing any
lone survivors, ma'am.

1:02:56.955 --> 1:02:58.723
Well, keep an eye out, tuan.

1:02:58.790 --> 1:03:00.425
Yes, ma'am.

1:03:00.492 --> 1:03:03.328
It's time to move outta here
before the other one comes back.

1:03:03.395 --> 1:03:06.130
Wilco, what's our comm
situation?

1:03:06.197 --> 1:03:08.366
No comms, but elf only, ma'am.

1:03:08.433 --> 1:03:11.636
Tell ping we're ready
to give back Dr. Lee.

1:03:11.703 --> 1:03:13.271
Yes, ma'am.

1:03:13.338 --> 1:03:14.906
And our previous
offer still stands.

1:03:14.973 --> 1:03:18.610
The beast is still out there
and these waters are not safe.

1:03:18.677 --> 1:03:20.345
Yes, ma'am.

1:03:21.646 --> 1:03:23.415
Are you ready
to go home, Dr. Lee?

1:03:25.784 --> 1:03:28.520
Yes, I think I will.

1:03:28.587 --> 1:03:30.322
It's safer for you that I do.

1:03:34.759 --> 1:03:37.228
Think about what's best to
help your country, Dr. Lee.

1:03:38.496 --> 1:03:40.298
That's the idea, captain.

1:03:42.334 --> 1:03:44.002
All right! All right!
Let's go, people!

1:03:44.069 --> 1:03:46.309
These waters aren't safe and
the shark's still out there!

1:03:46.338 --> 1:03:47.672
Let's go!

1:03:56.281 --> 1:03:58.283
The ships are going down!

1:04:01.219 --> 1:04:03.855
Change of plans!
We have to destroy that thing!

1:04:03.922 --> 1:04:05.657
- Fire!
- Fire!

1:04:09.761 --> 1:04:12.230
Full steam ahead!
Let's catch that thing!

1:04:12.297 --> 1:04:13.565
Yes, ma'am.

1:04:15.400 --> 1:04:17.402
Fire, fire, fire!

1:04:31.049 --> 1:04:33.918
Survivors! Survivors!
Let's bring 'em up!

1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:37.555
Let's go! Let's go!

1:04:37.622 --> 1:04:38.833
Come on, come on!
Let's go, let's go!

1:04:38.857 --> 1:04:40.191
Come on!

1:04:46.464 --> 1:04:47.866
Ahearn, ensign brand,

1:04:47.932 --> 1:04:49.801
get them inside and
make them comfortable.

1:04:52.337 --> 1:04:54.171
We need to get to shore, asap.

1:04:54.239 --> 1:04:55.573
Yes, ma'am.

1:04:55.640 --> 1:04:57.509
Full steam ahead,
that thing is coming back,

1:04:57.575 --> 1:04:59.286
and we need to get to port
before it catches us.

1:04:59.310 --> 1:05:00.655
<i>Samperio, keep your gunners
on their toes.</i>

1:05:00.679 --> 1:05:01.880
<i>We are our most vulnerable.</i>

1:05:01.946 --> 1:05:03.548
<i>We need to take that shark out.</i>

1:05:03.615 --> 1:05:05.535
Ma'am, we're out of ammo.
We've got nothing left.

1:05:10.288 --> 1:05:11.532
I need eyes on that shark, tuan!

1:05:11.556 --> 1:05:13.525
Sonar's still a little...

1:05:13.591 --> 1:05:15.460
Got it! Circling, moving
out fast!

1:05:15.527 --> 1:05:17.195
We don't have long! Let's go!

1:05:17.262 --> 1:05:19.597
Engineering says the ship
doesn't have long either, ma'am.

1:05:19.664 --> 1:05:21.866
We took an eye out, captain.

1:05:21.933 --> 1:05:23.234
Look, we got handguns
and rifles.

1:05:23.301 --> 1:05:25.904
We can still take
this thing down.

1:05:25.970 --> 1:05:27.250
That was a lucky shot, samperio!

1:05:27.305 --> 1:05:28.840
I don't expect we'll
get another one,

1:05:28.907 --> 1:05:30.451
but let's ready
the weapons just in case.

1:05:30.475 --> 1:05:31.876
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

1:05:31.943 --> 1:05:33.454
Killian, can we make it
before those things come back?

1:05:33.478 --> 1:05:34.879
I'm not hopeful
with that, captain.

1:05:34.946 --> 1:05:36.624
These things are fast
and we're injured badly.

1:05:36.648 --> 1:05:39.185
- Ahearn?
- Yes, ma'am.

1:05:39.250 --> 1:05:40.719
Take the con!

1:05:40.785 --> 1:05:42.785
Killian, keep moving
for land as fast as we can go!

1:05:42.821 --> 1:05:43.922
Yes, ma'am.

1:05:43.988 --> 1:05:45.757
Samperio, the moment
we see that thing...

1:05:45.824 --> 1:05:49.294
We'll go after it hand to
hand if we have to, captain!

1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:50.595
Follow me, Dr. Lee.

1:06:11.416 --> 1:06:13.151
I have nothing to say
to you, captain.

1:06:13.219 --> 1:06:14.519
Then just listen.

1:06:14.586 --> 1:06:18.056
Our ship is badly damaged,
possibly sunk.

1:06:18.123 --> 1:06:20.658
I'm just trying to
save everybody's lives,

1:06:20.725 --> 1:06:22.827
including yours.

1:06:22.894 --> 1:06:24.972
Now my government won't
step in because your government

1:06:24.996 --> 1:06:27.532
will consider it an act of war.

1:06:27.599 --> 1:06:30.168
I need your help.

1:06:30.236 --> 1:06:32.670
What kind of help?

1:06:32.737 --> 1:06:35.273
Well, that's just the thing.

1:06:35.340 --> 1:06:38.443
I'm a captain and so are you.

1:06:38.510 --> 1:06:39.950
I think the reason
that we lost to it

1:06:39.978 --> 1:06:42.380
is because we were fighting
alone and not together.

1:06:42.447 --> 1:06:46.451
What would you do if
you were me, captain ping?

1:06:46.518 --> 1:06:48.353
I don't understand
your question.

1:06:48.419 --> 1:06:50.088
I'm saying if someone
on your team

1:06:50.155 --> 1:06:52.224
must have worked
on this project.

1:06:52.290 --> 1:06:56.694
And someone must have faced
off with this thing before.

1:06:56.761 --> 1:06:58.463
Those things have
a real vendetta

1:06:58.530 --> 1:07:01.866
against your ships
and now ours, too.

1:07:01.933 --> 1:07:04.736
Now the beamformer.

1:07:04.803 --> 1:07:07.338
It must disorient them,
distract them.

1:07:07.405 --> 1:07:09.073
I know it draws
them to the tech,

1:07:09.140 --> 1:07:10.942
but I don't think they like it.

1:07:11.009 --> 1:07:13.044
I don't know what
you mean... beamformer.

1:07:28.059 --> 1:07:30.595
Where is your ship, Dr. Lee?

1:07:36.568 --> 1:07:40.905
If you can take us to
the ship, I can help you.

1:07:42.407 --> 1:07:44.509
Follow me to the bridge,
captain ping.

1:07:59.424 --> 1:08:00.859
What the hell did they just say?

1:08:00.925 --> 1:08:02.827
I had no idea what the hell
did they just said.

1:08:16.507 --> 1:08:18.277
This is our sense.

1:08:18.344 --> 1:08:20.945
It kills aquatic life
in its path...

1:08:21.012 --> 1:08:22.814
I see.

1:08:22.881 --> 1:08:26.218
And yet the megalodons
appears to be...

1:08:26.285 --> 1:08:27.585
Attracted to it...

1:08:27.652 --> 1:08:30.322
Although the ship might be sunk,

1:08:30.388 --> 1:08:34.092
but it appears that the sat
tech might still be alive.

1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:39.931
It might help us... perhaps.

1:08:41.399 --> 1:08:44.303
Crew, this is captain ping.

1:08:44.370 --> 1:08:47.772
He's going to help us...
Not die.

1:08:47.839 --> 1:08:50.319
Tuan, are we still receiving the
signal from their sunken ship?

1:08:50.376 --> 1:08:51.476
Yes, ma'am.

1:08:51.542 --> 1:08:55.113
Captain ping, what do we do?

1:08:55.180 --> 1:08:57.582
We must go to it.

1:08:57.649 --> 1:08:59.951
We must use its
beamform technology

1:09:00.018 --> 1:09:02.354
to destroy them.

1:09:02.420 --> 1:09:03.554
Killian?

1:09:03.621 --> 1:09:05.123
Set a course
for the sunken ship.

1:09:05.190 --> 1:09:06.834
That's the opposite direction
off the coast, captain.

1:09:06.858 --> 1:09:09.160
Yes, it is, Killian. Let's go.

1:09:09.228 --> 1:09:10.828
Yes, ma'am.

1:09:10.895 --> 1:09:12.630
Ma'am! The engine crew
is saying that

1:09:12.697 --> 1:09:14.032
we're taking on a lot of water.

1:09:14.098 --> 1:09:15.867
They are not sure
how long we can make it.

1:09:15.934 --> 1:09:19.371
We got about a one in a million
shot to survive this, people.

1:09:19.437 --> 1:09:22.540
But it's the only one we got,
so we're gonna take it.

1:09:22.607 --> 1:09:25.576
Killian, turn us around.

1:09:30.014 --> 1:09:32.083
Now you think
Lee's device will be able to...

1:09:32.150 --> 1:09:33.851
Connect to the device
on the sunken ship.

1:09:33.918 --> 1:09:38.756
And this whole ship will become
some kind of transponder.

1:09:38.823 --> 1:09:42.126
I don't know what will
happen to us nor its ship.

1:09:44.095 --> 1:09:45.997
Captain ping...

1:09:46.064 --> 1:09:47.641
If we do this, it will destroy
all the information

1:09:47.665 --> 1:09:49.667
that we gathered.

1:09:51.569 --> 1:09:53.705
You've got to be kidding me.

1:09:53.771 --> 1:09:55.707
Is there something wrong,
Killian?

1:09:55.773 --> 1:09:57.775
They're speaking in code, sir.

1:09:57.842 --> 1:09:59.411
It's mandarin, Killian.

1:09:59.477 --> 1:10:02.013
It's a language spoken by
billions all over the world.

1:10:02.080 --> 1:10:03.481
Just because
you don't understand it

1:10:03.548 --> 1:10:05.016
doesn't mean it's code.

1:10:05.083 --> 1:10:06.918
They could be leading
us into a trap,

1:10:06.985 --> 1:10:09.297
trying to protect whatever's on
that ship from being discovered.

1:10:09.321 --> 1:10:10.755
I trust the captain

1:10:10.822 --> 1:10:13.558
and the captain trusts them,
so I trust them.

1:10:15.526 --> 1:10:17.161
You got a problem
with that, sailor?

1:10:19.365 --> 1:10:20.531
No, sir.

1:10:20.598 --> 1:10:21.933
Good.

1:10:24.002 --> 1:10:25.036
Ahearn?

1:10:25.103 --> 1:10:26.637
What's the update on
engineering?

1:10:26.704 --> 1:10:27.704
Been better, ma'am.

1:10:27.739 --> 1:10:29.007
Are we sinking?

1:10:29.073 --> 1:10:29.941
Not yet, ma'am.

1:10:30.008 --> 1:10:32.143
I'll call that a win for now.

1:10:32.211 --> 1:10:34.679
Wilco, do you and
Lee have that thing set up?

1:10:34.746 --> 1:10:35.747
I do, ma'am.

1:10:35.813 --> 1:10:37.882
But when we turn
this thing on...

1:10:37.949 --> 1:10:40.185
Yes?

1:10:40.252 --> 1:10:44.589
We're gonna lose al our comms,
probably much more than that.

1:10:44.655 --> 1:10:46.591
Understood, Wilco.

1:10:50.028 --> 1:10:52.764
<i>Target has been spotted, ma'am.
The beast is in sight.</i>

1:10:52.830 --> 1:10:54.732
Fire a warning shot, samperio!

1:10:54.799 --> 1:10:56.534
Keep those things distracted!

1:10:56.601 --> 1:10:57.769
Yes, ma'am.

1:11:11.549 --> 1:11:13.017
Again, samperio!

1:11:13.084 --> 1:11:15.553
It's my last shot, ma'am.

1:11:15.620 --> 1:11:16.954
You want me to take it?

1:11:19.191 --> 1:11:20.691
No.

1:11:20.758 --> 1:11:22.093
We don't know if this will work

1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:24.629
and we'll need everything
we got left.

1:11:24.695 --> 1:11:26.097
Yes, ma'am.

1:11:26.164 --> 1:11:28.534
Ma'am, we're just
over the top of it.

1:11:28.599 --> 1:11:33.338
While we're here, we cannot move
our positions, no matter what.

1:11:34.972 --> 1:11:36.212
It will disrupt the connection.

1:11:39.244 --> 1:11:42.013
Well, screw it.
Turn on the device.

1:11:43.881 --> 1:11:45.284
Yes, ma'am.

1:12:03.101 --> 1:12:04.203
Are you okay?

1:12:04.269 --> 1:12:05.370
I'm good.

1:12:37.101 --> 1:12:40.171
Any sign of it?

1:12:40.239 --> 1:12:41.739
No sign of it.

1:12:41.806 --> 1:12:42.806
Must be way down there.

1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:44.276
Or dead...

1:12:46.378 --> 1:12:47.378
We need to be sure.

1:12:57.989 --> 1:12:59.358
Ma'am, it's...

1:12:59.424 --> 1:13:01.792
It didn't work!
That shark's still alive.

1:13:04.762 --> 1:13:07.466
We're dead! We're all dead!

1:13:07.533 --> 1:13:09.434
No, no, we're not.

1:13:11.169 --> 1:13:12.870
Not yet.

1:13:12.937 --> 1:13:15.706
Battle stations!
Battle stations!

1:13:17.808 --> 1:13:18.876
Let's go! Battle stations!

1:13:29.086 --> 1:13:31.557
Arm yourselves!
We have to be ready!

1:13:31.623 --> 1:13:33.392
Let's go! Let's go!

1:13:34.926 --> 1:13:36.428
Battle stations! Come on!

1:13:36.495 --> 1:13:38.162
Let's go! Battle stations!

1:13:38.230 --> 1:13:40.131
Let's do this! Battle stations!

1:13:40.199 --> 1:13:41.300
Come on!

1:13:46.605 --> 1:13:47.905
Let's go, people! Come on!

1:13:47.972 --> 1:13:49.073
Let's get 'em!

1:13:49.140 --> 1:13:50.375
Let's get 'em! Come on!

1:13:50.442 --> 1:13:51.776
Let's get 'em!

1:13:51.842 --> 1:13:54.246
Eyes to the sea!
Eyes to the sea! Let's go!

1:14:13.798 --> 1:14:14.932
Get ready, y'all.

1:14:22.541 --> 1:14:23.941
Let's go, boys!

1:14:31.283 --> 1:14:33.518
- Wilco!
- No!

1:14:37.522 --> 1:14:38.522
No!

1:14:52.036 --> 1:14:54.772
Where is it? Anybody see it?

1:14:54.839 --> 1:14:57.442
Does anybody see it?

1:14:57.509 --> 1:14:58.577
Disappeared.

1:14:58.644 --> 1:15:00.778
It must be underneath us!

1:15:00.845 --> 1:15:02.547
It's gonna hull us,
drag us down!

1:15:28.839 --> 1:15:30.041
It stopped.

1:15:30.107 --> 1:15:31.410
It knows we're dead.

1:15:31.476 --> 1:15:33.445
It's waiting for us
to climb out.

1:15:33.512 --> 1:15:34.512
We're gonna be lunch.

1:15:37.982 --> 1:15:39.384
I'll stay aboard
and distract it.

1:15:39.451 --> 1:15:40.719
Everybody go!

1:15:40.786 --> 1:15:42.987
Like I'm leaving you,
captain... or anyone else.

1:15:48.593 --> 1:15:51.162
Head to engineering!
Have them rev the engines!

1:15:51.229 --> 1:15:52.930
Bring that thing back to us!

1:16:05.444 --> 1:16:07.646
Here it comes!

1:16:07.713 --> 1:16:09.648
Wait for it to come close!

1:16:09.715 --> 1:16:11.082
Whites of the eyes, people!

1:16:17.255 --> 1:16:18.523
2:00!

1:16:31.902 --> 1:16:33.904
What happened, captain?

1:16:33.971 --> 1:16:35.507
Something hit it.

1:16:39.177 --> 1:16:40.945
It's commander Moore's sub!

1:16:48.787 --> 1:16:50.222
He's heading for the megalodon!

1:16:53.258 --> 1:16:55.527
Okay, you big giant...

1:17:03.735 --> 1:17:05.303
The ship's going down, captain!

1:17:05.370 --> 1:17:08.573
Are there any more
lifeboats, ahearn?

1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:10.242
No, ma'am.

1:17:17.349 --> 1:17:21.186
Do you think commander Moore
killed it... or it killed him?

1:17:21.253 --> 1:17:23.321
I think we're gonna
find out very soon!

1:17:23.388 --> 1:17:26.425
Give it everything you got!

1:17:26.491 --> 1:17:28.159
Get ready for it!

1:17:41.138 --> 1:17:42.474
I'd have brought a bigger boat

1:17:42.541 --> 1:17:44.609
if I'd known
there'd been any left!

1:17:46.143 --> 1:17:48.346
We won, baby! We won!

1:17:48.413 --> 1:17:50.315
Yes!

1:17:50.382 --> 1:17:51.982
Thank you!

1:17:52.049 --> 1:17:53.685
That's what
I'm talking about, baby!

1:17:58.924 --> 1:18:00.325
I love this thing.

1:18:00.392 --> 1:18:04.496
Hoo-rah. Okay, fishes,
it's a watery grave.

1:18:04.563 --> 1:18:05.597
We're goin' in.

1:18:05.664 --> 1:18:07.699
Abandon ship! Let's go, people!

1:18:13.472 --> 1:18:16.241
We lost a lot of
good people today.

1:18:16.308 --> 1:18:19.377
If it weren't for the bravery
from both my crew

1:18:19.444 --> 1:18:21.580
and the many men
and women of San Diego,

1:18:21.646 --> 1:18:24.014
as well as members
of the Chinese Navy,

1:18:24.081 --> 1:18:27.252
far more destruction would have
been wrought by these creatures.

1:18:27.319 --> 1:18:28.854
Excuse me, captain lynch.

1:18:28.920 --> 1:18:31.957
Were you aware of the existence
of more of these creatures?

1:18:32.022 --> 1:18:34.192
We've officially
seen no evidence

1:18:34.259 --> 1:18:35.536
that there are any
more of these megalodons.

1:18:35.560 --> 1:18:37.529
Officially seen?

1:18:37.596 --> 1:18:39.063
That is correct.

1:18:39.129 --> 1:18:40.508
But you weren't
officially aware of these three

1:18:40.532 --> 1:18:42.534
before they demolished the base.

1:18:42.601 --> 1:18:46.136
So how do we know
there aren't more out there?

1:18:46.204 --> 1:18:49.441
We don't.

1:18:51.877 --> 1:18:53.588
There are rumors that
you're tagging and tracking

1:18:53.612 --> 1:18:56.348
undersea objects and there
may be more megalodons.

1:18:56.414 --> 1:18:58.650
I don't comment on rumors.

1:18:58.717 --> 1:19:01.186
Captain lynch, care to
comment on your sister's case?

1:19:01.253 --> 1:19:03.889
What were Chinese ships
doing in U.S. waters?

1:19:03.955 --> 1:19:04.890
Are we going to war?

1:19:04.956 --> 1:19:06.458
Thank you.

1:19:06.525 --> 1:19:08.101
That is all I have to say
about this at the present time.

1:19:08.125 --> 1:19:09.995
- Captain lynch...
- Captain lynch...

1:19:10.060 --> 1:19:11.272
- Captain lynch... please!
- Captain lynch?

1:19:11.296 --> 1:19:13.097
Captain lynch...

1:19:13.163 --> 1:19:15.200
Hey, what is that?

1:19:15.267 --> 1:19:16.535
That's the thing. I don't know.

1:19:18.068 --> 1:19:20.137
- I can't make out...
- Can't tell what it is...

1:19:20.205 --> 1:19:23.107
How'd I do?

1:19:23.173 --> 1:19:25.277
- Terrible.
- Terrible.

1:19:25.343 --> 1:19:26.703
I'm ready to get
back in the water.

1:19:26.745 --> 1:19:28.185
How's the tagging
and tracking going?

1:19:28.246 --> 1:19:29.781
Hard to say.

1:19:29.848 --> 1:19:31.516
Do you think they're mates?

1:19:31.583 --> 1:19:32.751
Hard to say.

1:19:32.817 --> 1:19:36.053
- Not till we go looking.
- Not until we go looking.

1:19:36.120 --> 1:19:37.822
- Well...
- We won't know.

1:19:37.889 --> 1:19:39.324
Let's go looking, gentlemen.

1:19:39.391 --> 1:19:42.227
Is that your thing? Like
repeating everything I say?

1:19:42.294 --> 1:19:43.604
- Oh, my goodness...
- I'm not trying...

1:19:43.628 --> 1:19:44.429
Let's go!

1:19:44.496 --> 1:19:46.565
It just that it seems like I am.
