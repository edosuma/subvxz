00:04.472 --> 00:07.106
¶ Tell me something ¶

00:07.108 --> 00:10.609
¶ I want to know
what are the rules of the game ¶

00:10.611 --> 00:13.645
¶ the game of love... ¶

00:13.647 --> 00:17.516
an associate will be right out
to help you, sir.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.552
Um, no. Um...

00:21.622 --> 00:23.622
My old man said you got a sale

00:23.624 --> 00:25.357
going on in the back room?

00:25.359 --> 00:28.227
First-timers need a coupon.

00:30.664 --> 00:33.632
Just clipped it
this morning.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.601
All right, arms out
to your side.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.674
All right, follow me.
(Clears his throat)

00:45.079 --> 00:47.379
(Cell phone ringing)

00:47.381 --> 00:49.448
(Audio from televisions
overlapping)

00:56.524 --> 00:59.224
I, um...

00:59.226 --> 01:00.793
I'm not sure
how this works.

01:00.795 --> 01:04.063
Well, you know something
about how this works.

01:04.065 --> 01:06.665
If you're back here,
you brought money.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.834
Yes, sir.

01:12.339 --> 01:14.640
But I'm here for yours.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.444
Nobody moves,
nobody gets hurt.

01:18.446 --> 01:21.747
You sure you want
to do this, kid?

01:21.749 --> 01:24.817
Wallets in the bag.

01:24.819 --> 01:27.453
Now!

01:27.455 --> 01:31.590
No, not you. You're
gonna open the safe.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.159
(Clears his throat)

01:34.161 --> 01:37.129
And it better just be money

01:37.131 --> 01:40.499
you're pulling out of
there, nothing funny.

01:40.501 --> 01:43.535
Nobody's laughing, kid.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.777
(Grunts)

01:53.681 --> 01:55.581
No, you can have it.

01:55.583 --> 01:59.284
But you won't be alive
long enough to spend it.

01:59.286 --> 02:02.321
(Panting)

02:02.323 --> 02:05.357
Go on, take it, get out.

02:05.359 --> 02:08.393
No need for that anymore.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.899
Unless I want to make sure
no one follows me.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.708
NASA employee or just a fan?

02:56.710 --> 02:59.344
Bishops: Navy seaman
apprentice Brian dokes.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.747
Alexandria police I.D.'D him.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.815
Dokes only enlisted
about six months ago,

03:03.817 --> 03:07.719
so, he had a ways
to go before NASA.

03:07.721 --> 03:10.189
Well, doesn't stop the dream.

03:10.191 --> 03:12.391
Car crash did.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.959
Making assumptions,
Anthony?

03:13.961 --> 03:16.628
We won't know what killed this
poor man's dream until autopsy.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.947
Tony:
"Poor man"?

03:18.948 --> 03:21.265
Sounds like you're assuming
he's an innocent victim, ducky.

03:21.268 --> 03:23.902
I wasn't making any assumptions.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.537
(Whistles)

03:25.539 --> 03:28.774
(Laughing):
Good, 'cause he's not innocent.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.309
What do you got?

03:30.311 --> 03:32.211
Got a crate
full of grenades.

03:33.781 --> 03:36.448
Ah. One's missing.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.816
Not exactly standard issue
for seaman apprentices.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.918
It's not standard issue
for anyone.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.787
Oh!

03:41.789 --> 03:43.422
Practice grenade.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.958
So it leaves hope for
ducky's assumption.

03:45.960 --> 03:49.828
I wasn't presupposing anything
about the man himself.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.530
I meant "poor"
to mean unfortunate.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.298
It's simple semantics.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.968
Well, I don't think he was poor
in any sense of the word.

03:55.970 --> 03:58.303
Look what I found
under the seat.

03:58.305 --> 03:59.805
Tony:
Ooh!

03:59.807 --> 04:01.773
Wow.

04:01.775 --> 04:05.310
Look at that. That's got to
be about 200 grand there.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.945
Boss, McGee found 50 grand!

04:06.947 --> 04:09.881
Grenades, bag full of money.

04:09.883 --> 04:12.584
Robbery gone bad?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.920
The robbery
went just fine.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.421
Body, bishop.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.957
Bishop:
Blood trail.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.026
He survived the crash
long enough

04:21.028 --> 04:22.628
to wander out here anyway.

04:22.630 --> 04:23.829
Duck, you got a time of death?

04:23.831 --> 04:24.830
I'd guess

04:24.832 --> 04:26.932
between 10:00
and 11:00 P.M.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.600
Wounds from the crash?

04:28.602 --> 04:31.036
Yeah, they appear
to be defensive.

04:31.038 --> 04:34.406
Here, help me
roll him over.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.475
(Grunting)

04:38.812 --> 04:40.445
Oh, my.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.414
Looks like
his eye was ripped out.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.049
Can that happen
in an accident?

04:44.051 --> 04:46.351
Ducky:
Well, as previously stated,

04:46.353 --> 04:47.853
I don't jump to conclusions,

04:47.855 --> 04:51.823
but, well, it would appear
this is no accident.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.927
Bishop:
Dokes' record is clean.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.930
Made it through basic
and "a" school with high marks.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.732
First deployment was scheduled
for tomorrow.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.835
Our seaman has a dad
with a drug problem.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.571
When I tried
to contact next of kin,

05:06.573 --> 05:09.708
I was forwarded
to Sandy oaks rehab center.

05:09.710 --> 05:10.909
On the potomac?

05:10.911 --> 05:12.678
Celebrities can barely
afford that place.

05:12.680 --> 05:13.979
Yeah, well,
father's already been

05:13.981 --> 05:16.381
through a state-funded facility.

05:16.383 --> 05:18.617
Unsuccessfully, I take it?

05:18.619 --> 05:19.751
Last option
was a private clinic.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.720
Son used his Navy signing bonus

05:21.722 --> 05:24.656
to get his daddy in,
and now the rest is due.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.857
Okay, who did he rob?

05:25.859 --> 05:27.592
Same person that killed him?

05:27.594 --> 05:29.594
Then why leave the money behind?

05:29.596 --> 05:31.997
Good questions.
I would rather have answers.

05:31.999 --> 05:35.901
We may have answers
at the front gate, boss.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.869
Explain that.
Security detained

05:37.871 --> 05:39.871
a Mr. kip klugman,
who claims to know

05:39.873 --> 05:42.674
who our seaman
robbed last night.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.875
Well, media knows about
the car crash

05:43.877 --> 05:46.044
and the body, not the money.

05:46.046 --> 05:49.948
So, this informant could
be legit-- who is he?

05:49.950 --> 05:52.351
Well, no wonder security office
won't let him through.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.552
He's got a criminal record.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.921
Put it up.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.992
He's a former NCIS
special agent.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.662
Tony:
Arrested ten years ago.

06:03.664 --> 06:06.732
He stole evidence
out of camp Pendleton.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.834
Cash and drugs.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.469
You worked the case?

06:10.471 --> 06:11.870
No.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.672
No, but I remember who did.

06:13.674 --> 06:17.008
Special agent Leon Vance.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.777
Klugman must've been

06:18.779 --> 06:21.747
his last investigation
as special agent.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.682
He likes a clean house.

06:23.684 --> 06:24.950
McGee:
How's the director gonna feel

06:24.952 --> 06:27.018
about a disgraced agent
being an informant?

06:27.020 --> 06:30.422
Won't be an issue, agent McGee.

06:30.424 --> 06:33.592
'Cause it's not gonna happen.
Gibbs?

06:38.399 --> 06:40.098
Klugman's a con man.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.902
He's always got an angle
or something up his sleeve.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.138
Trust me, anything he knows
about this case is a lie.

06:46.140 --> 06:48.974
What if it's not?

06:48.976 --> 06:51.943
It's gonna take a whole lot
to convince me otherwise.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.446
Man (Over P.A.): Security,
this is visitor center.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.715
(Man continues
indistinctly over P.A.)

06:56.717 --> 06:58.483
(Gasps)

06:58.485 --> 07:00.786
Director Vance.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.187
Sounds so odd
calling you that.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.522
If he won't leave,
arrest him.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.090
Whoa...

07:05.092 --> 07:07.092
Isn't once enough for you?

07:07.094 --> 07:08.760
Look, I'm here to help.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.529
You only help yourself.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.097
I've changed.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.098
Who know?

07:13.100 --> 07:15.066
The correctional system works.

07:15.068 --> 07:18.804
I can prove my worth, sir.

07:20.441 --> 07:21.973
Guard: Grenade!
Don't move! Don't move!

07:21.975 --> 07:23.909
Oops.
(Chuckles)

07:23.911 --> 07:25.877
It's just a training grenade.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.846
It's a dud.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.748
Stand down, everybody.

07:32.052 --> 07:35.053
It was used in a robbery
last night, and, uh,

07:35.055 --> 07:36.521
I know where.

07:36.523 --> 07:38.990
What do you say, Leon?

07:38.992 --> 07:41.460
Want to solve a murder together?

07:41.462 --> 07:43.195
For old time's sake?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.607
I have a friend
who was there last night

07:55.609 --> 07:56.875
when the place got robbed.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.710
Does this friend have a name?

07:58.712 --> 08:01.513
He wants to remain anonymous.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.548
But I suppose I have Leon
to thank for meeting him at all.

08:03.550 --> 08:05.550
I didn't let you in here
for old time's sake.

08:05.552 --> 08:07.853
And it's director Vance.

08:10.491 --> 08:12.657
After prison, I went
to work for a man

08:12.659 --> 08:14.226
named Kobe carver.

08:14.228 --> 08:15.927
He runs an illegal sports book.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.163
He's an angry guy.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.065
They call him beef
behind his back,

08:20.067 --> 08:22.033
because he never
forgives a debt.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.570
Now, look, the news said
a sailor got in a wreck

08:25.572 --> 08:27.739
the police were
calling suspicious.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.909
My source says beef followed and
killed the kid that robbed him.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.944
Makes sense, right?

08:32.946 --> 08:35.113
(Chuckles)
Look, you can check it out.

08:35.115 --> 08:38.016
They run it in back
of a lingerie store.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.951
Safe's in the floor.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.052
I don't know, director.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.955
This guy's been
extremely helpful.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.056
Super helpful.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.725
Yeah, maybe too helpful.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.760
Yeah, it's funny
you should say that.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.996
All right, look,
i know how it looks.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.297
Like you owe beef money.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.032
And rather than pay up,

08:54.034 --> 08:55.834
you saw the opportunity
to rat on him.

08:55.836 --> 08:58.737
Boss goes to prison,
debt goes away, right?

08:58.739 --> 09:00.739
Those odds are good.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.074
Yeah, and you were
always a gambling man.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.944
Well, that's why I'm trying
to turn over a new leaf here.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.579
Right.

09:07.581 --> 09:10.148
You still box, director?

09:10.150 --> 09:12.050
Every day.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.152
It helps relieve stress.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.854
Exactly.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.089
It's your way
of working out demons.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.859
I couldn't do that
in my life.

09:20.861 --> 09:23.328
So I decided to try going clean.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.931
Making good on past sins.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.066
You got a long way
to go for that.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.569
I know.

09:30.571 --> 09:33.238
At least, let me apologize.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.740
Okay?
For framing you?

09:35.742 --> 09:38.977
For making them think you took
that money from evidence.

09:38.979 --> 09:41.713
I was desperate.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.819
Follow up on his info,
but I'm done here.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.988
And so is he.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.692
Just like last time,
huh, Leon?

09:53.694 --> 09:55.894
Not willing to listen
to anything I had to say.

09:55.896 --> 09:59.064
Just using one of your own
agents to climb the ladder.
Gibbs: Enough.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.365
You want me to alert
building security?

10:00.367 --> 10:02.033
Nope. I'll shoot him.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.301
All right, I'm going.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.903
But I came here
to clear my conscious.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.338
The man wouldn't even
give me a chance.

10:06.340 --> 10:08.907
Well, not that you've
done so publically,

10:08.909 --> 10:10.875
why don't you let me
explain myself?

10:10.877 --> 10:12.811
By getting rid of a dirty agent
ten years ago,

10:12.813 --> 10:14.379
I was protecting my own.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.281
And I will continue
to protect them.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.617
So I suggest you stay away
from this building

10:18.619 --> 10:20.685
and the honest agents
that work here,

10:20.687 --> 10:24.656
or any problem you have with me
will get much, much bigger.

10:24.658 --> 10:27.058
(Elevator dings)

10:27.060 --> 10:28.193
(Sighs)

10:28.195 --> 10:30.095
I was here to help.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.197
But...

10:32.199 --> 10:34.733
You really are
just a politician now, huh?

10:34.735 --> 10:36.801
Go.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.040
(Elevator bell dings)

10:56.757 --> 10:58.823
How is this possible?

10:58.825 --> 11:00.825
These are
the preliminary results

11:00.827 --> 11:02.127
from the blood
and tissue samples

11:02.129 --> 11:03.962
found underneath our
victim's fingernails.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.130
Yeah, he fought back.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.098
He was getting
his eyes clawed out.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.200
Yeah, that's the problem.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.836
There's only a
single source of DNA.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.105
And it belongs
to our victim.

11:14.107 --> 11:17.142
He clawed out
his own eyes-- why?

11:18.111 --> 11:19.911
Oh, his blood work

11:19.913 --> 11:21.846
shows huge amounts of LSD.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.848
Violent hallucinations.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.985
That would explain the car wreck
and the self-mutilation.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.087
Yeah, but it's odd.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.156
I mean, for a guy
who was so desperate

11:31.158 --> 11:32.891
to get his dad clean?

11:32.893 --> 11:36.261
And there were no narcotics
found in the car.

11:36.263 --> 11:39.030
Something's... hinky.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.298
So he was drugged sometime

11:40.300 --> 11:42.967
between the robbery
and the car crash.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.903
No, it's true!

11:44.905 --> 11:46.471
Theodore Roosevelt
hated the fact

11:46.473 --> 11:48.206
that a bear was named after him.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.708
So what he did,

11:49.710 --> 11:52.177
he started spreading rumors
that he had

11:52.179 --> 11:54.345
a fetish for women's bra slips.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.480
Hence the name...

11:55.482 --> 11:57.315
Teddy!

11:57.317 --> 11:59.384
Hmm, I asked as a joke,

11:59.386 --> 12:01.252
but thanks, ducky.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.121
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:03.123 --> 12:05.490
But this boutique
is by appointment only.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.392
Well, my colleague
here would like

12:07.394 --> 12:09.227
to try this on
in the back room.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.129
Ah...

12:11.130 --> 12:13.030
Yeah, but I was thinking
something that more goes

12:13.033 --> 12:14.399
with, um, gold?

12:14.401 --> 12:17.268
In that case,
i should explain

12:17.270 --> 12:18.303
that I don't work here.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.771
Uh, Laura strike-depalma,

12:19.773 --> 12:21.506
Mr. carver's attorney.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.742
Hmm.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.410
Beef always keep
his lawyer around?

12:25.412 --> 12:27.178
Please don't call him that.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.848
And since I don't see warrants,

12:29.850 --> 12:31.950
this meeting will be a courtesy.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.352
I take it a trip to
the back room is out?

12:34.354 --> 12:35.420
Not at all.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.188
Follow me.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.425
(Door opens)

12:40.427 --> 12:42.427
Carver:
Thongs go below!

12:42.429 --> 12:44.295
Camisoles, bras, underwear,

12:44.297 --> 12:46.397
stockings-- we arrange
top to bottom,

12:46.399 --> 12:48.233
you useless lump.
On the bottom...

12:48.235 --> 12:49.501
Open your eyes for once!

12:49.503 --> 12:51.469
Panties in a bunch there,
beef?

12:51.471 --> 12:53.538
NCIS special agents DiNozzo,

12:53.540 --> 12:55.273
bishop.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.176
You know, I've always
hated that word.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.344
"Beef"?

12:59.346 --> 13:00.545
"Panties."

13:00.547 --> 13:01.813
Sounds kind of creepy.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.915
Especially from me, right?

13:03.917 --> 13:07.519
Yeah, lingerie store
was the wife's idea.

13:07.521 --> 13:09.854
So, the illegal sports book
was yours, then?

13:11.057 --> 13:12.557
(Chuckles)

13:12.559 --> 13:14.559
No idea what you mean.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.896
But I'd love to know who
exactly you heard it from.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.364
Well, I bet you would.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.532
But...

13:20.534 --> 13:22.367
Then I have a feeling
that the same thing

13:22.369 --> 13:24.269
would happen to him

13:24.271 --> 13:26.171
that happened to the last guy
that pissed you off.

13:26.173 --> 13:27.205
So...

13:27.207 --> 13:28.973
Yeah, where were you
last night

13:28.975 --> 13:31.075
between 10:00 and 11:00?

13:31.077 --> 13:32.410
Strike-depalma:
He drops off the night deposit.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.379
At a bank down the street.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.849
45 minutes from Alexandria.

13:37.851 --> 13:40.151
Hmm, so you know
about the car wreck?

13:41.354 --> 13:43.288
Interesting.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.490
You need some help
moving these off the floor?

13:45.492 --> 13:47.225
Please do not touch anything
without permission.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.093
Nah, lump will get them later.

13:49.095 --> 13:50.929
I'm a big strapping lad.
I can help you with the boxes.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.063
Come on, let me help you.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.531
Get the hell
out of my store!

13:53.533 --> 13:56.000
Clearly courtesy wasn't enough.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.902
Well, if you've got
nothing to hide--

13:57.904 --> 14:00.438
hey!

14:00.439 --> 14:02.973
Smug s.O.B., you got
nothing on me and you know it.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.589
(Beeping)

14:40.046 --> 14:42.914
(Doorbell ringing)

14:50.523 --> 14:53.424
Son of a bitch.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.660
Klugman, what the hell
are you doing here?!

14:55.662 --> 14:57.595
Hey! Hey! Hey!

14:57.597 --> 14:58.963
(Siren wailing in distance)

14:58.965 --> 15:01.132
Who did this to you?

15:01.134 --> 15:02.600
(Chuckles)

15:02.602 --> 15:05.570
You did this...

15:05.572 --> 15:07.639
Director.

15:19.519 --> 15:24.088
(Siren chirping)

15:24.090 --> 15:25.523
According to the 911 tape,

15:25.525 --> 15:27.458
klugman says
you attacked him.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.960
He's framing me.

15:28.962 --> 15:31.095
Like old times.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.131
Your team's taking
his statement?

15:33.133 --> 15:36.601
Well, he says he
came to apologize.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.503
And you made good

15:38.505 --> 15:40.672
on your earlier threat
in the squad room.

15:40.674 --> 15:42.373
And you believe him?

15:45.011 --> 15:47.712
Gibbs, I box after work.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.614
I even told him as much.

15:49.616 --> 15:50.949
Look, McGee swabbed my hands.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.216
This will never hold up.

15:52.218 --> 15:55.053
It only has to look bad, Leon.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.188
How bad?

15:59.626 --> 16:01.092
Porter:
Gentlemen?

16:01.094 --> 16:03.094
It's been awhile.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.331
Two bullets and no worse
for wear, agent Gibbs.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.132
How's recovery?

16:08.134 --> 16:09.701
Tedious, madam secretary.

16:09.703 --> 16:11.569
No, no, come on.

16:11.571 --> 16:14.238
Director, may we speak
in private, please?

16:14.240 --> 16:15.573
Certainly.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.111
Porter:
<i> Sorry for the house call.</i>

16:20.113 --> 16:22.680
But this is not
the kind of attention

16:22.682 --> 16:25.750
that the secretary
of defense wants.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.986
Klugman's already lawyered up,

16:27.987 --> 16:30.221
and he's threatening a press
conference and a civil suit.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.290
It's a lie.
Of course it is.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.309
But this is Washington.

16:34.310 --> 16:36.327
How much mud-slinging
will you and the agency endure

16:36.329 --> 16:39.297
before we can prove it?

16:39.299 --> 16:41.466
All right, what
option do we have?

16:41.468 --> 16:43.468
Well, per klugman's lawyer,

16:43.470 --> 16:45.336
he drops this whole thing

16:45.338 --> 16:47.171
if you step down.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.242
Leon, there are
no good options here.

16:51.244 --> 16:54.212
You've been in this chair

16:54.214 --> 16:56.547
for longer than your last
two predecessors combined.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.149
Maybe it's time for a change.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.018
Maybe you write a book.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.586
Go fishing.

17:01.588 --> 17:04.122
Spend time with your kids.

17:04.124 --> 17:07.358
And what kind of example does
running away set for them?

17:07.360 --> 17:10.261
Are you too close to this case?

17:10.263 --> 17:12.597
The body was found
in Alexandria.

17:12.599 --> 17:16.200
I make a call,
i have the case transferred.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.568
That won't be necessary.

17:17.570 --> 17:21.472
I offer this
out of respect to you, Leon.

17:21.474 --> 17:25.443
And everything that you have
already given this agency.

17:27.580 --> 17:30.415
Thank you.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.218
What we got, duck?

17:34.220 --> 17:35.787
In which case?

17:35.789 --> 17:38.756
Well, start with the
one on your table.

17:38.758 --> 17:42.193
Uh, cause of death
was respiratory failure.

17:42.195 --> 17:45.129
His nervous system
went into shock.

17:45.131 --> 17:47.765
Whoever drugged this young man
knew they were giving him

17:47.767 --> 17:50.268
a concentrated dose,
which would prove lethal.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.702
Our second victim?

17:51.704 --> 17:53.337
Uh, Mr. klugman?

17:53.339 --> 17:55.306
Well, a doctor at the facility
where he's being treated

17:55.308 --> 17:58.076
is an old friend.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.244
She faxed over these.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.146
According to her notes,

18:02.148 --> 18:03.848
klugman had no
defensive wounds

18:03.850 --> 18:06.451
and received the
most severe blows

18:06.453 --> 18:09.220
to the right side of
his face and head.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.255
Left handed attacker?

18:11.257 --> 18:12.590
I got a wicked
southpaw, doctor,

18:12.592 --> 18:13.858
but the power's in my right.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.461
All the better
to prove your innocence.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.329
Not about innocence.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.331
It's about perception.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.233
You're not the only one
seeing things change

18:22.235 --> 18:24.268
and trying to roll
with the punches, Gibbs.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.104
It seems now I'm fighting
the political forces

18:26.106 --> 18:28.372
that I'm accused
of being a part of.

18:28.374 --> 18:31.175
The job changes, Leon.

18:31.177 --> 18:33.678
Yeah, and I'm usually the one
henpecking you to tread lightly.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.646
Yeah, and now?

18:35.648 --> 18:37.448
I know klugman.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.351
He's not coming after me
just for revenge.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.452
He's mixed up in all this.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.287
He's a con man with an end game.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.288
What's the end game?

18:44.290 --> 18:46.324
I have no idea.

18:46.325 --> 18:48.359
Which is actually
what brings me down here.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.428
I, um...

18:53.333 --> 18:56.334
I would like
to ride with you on this.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.736
As a member
of your team, Gibbs.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.607
(Quiet grunt)

19:02.609 --> 19:04.275
Yeah, sure, director.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.377
Done.

19:06.379 --> 19:09.380
I was expecting to go
12 rounds on this.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.315
What-what's the catch?

19:11.317 --> 19:13.184
Hey!

19:13.186 --> 19:15.386
What are you
waiting for, probie?

19:16.422 --> 19:19.524
Be careful what you wish for,
director.

19:22.162 --> 19:23.928
A dentist, a limo driver

19:23.930 --> 19:26.364
and a<i> cirque du</i>
<i> soleil</i> performer.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.232
Sounds like a setup to a joke.

19:28.234 --> 19:30.401
They all walked into
an illegal sports book,

19:30.403 --> 19:32.403
but won't admit it.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.771
And let me guess--
they lost their wallets,

19:33.773 --> 19:35.273
but don't know where?

19:36.209 --> 19:37.608
So...

19:37.610 --> 19:38.876
I got nothing.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.178
Yeah, me, neither.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.479
Beef's alibi checks out.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.680
He wasn't at the car crash.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.949
Any word about
the director?

19:44.951 --> 19:48.486
So I guess this would be a bad
time to ask him to sign an aff.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.321
Asset forfeiture?

19:50.323 --> 19:51.789
Yeah, in the event

19:51.791 --> 19:53.291
this case gets solved,

19:53.293 --> 19:54.792
we can apply
for some of the dirty money

19:54.794 --> 19:56.894
to go back to NCIS.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.764
And I was thinking of
vending machines, but now...

19:59.766 --> 20:02.366
Legal funds for
director Vance.

20:02.368 --> 20:05.269
Well, he's got kids.

20:05.271 --> 20:08.806
Which is why
we keep working.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.509
Hey, anybody
talk to Gibbs lately?

20:11.511 --> 20:13.511
Knowing Gibbs, he's probably
interrogating klugman

20:13.513 --> 20:16.280
in the back of a frozen
meat locker somewhere.

20:16.282 --> 20:18.482
Anyone seen director
Vance, either?

20:18.484 --> 20:20.918
Yeah.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.420
DiNozzo.

20:22.422 --> 20:23.688
Oh, hey, boss.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.489
Am I interrupting
personal errands?

20:25.491 --> 20:26.390
Yep.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.858
Got it.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.461
So I will just
leave you to that.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.530
We were just wondering

20:32.532 --> 20:34.765
in case any of the
errands run long,

20:34.767 --> 20:37.702
uh, are we covering for one

20:37.704 --> 20:38.903
person or two?

20:38.905 --> 20:41.539
I got no idea what
you're talking about.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.541
Vance:
Got eyes on our boy.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.376
And nobody asked
you to cover.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.378
(Sighs)

20:47.380 --> 20:48.846
Oh, hang on a second.

20:48.848 --> 20:49.947
Can I help you?

20:49.949 --> 20:51.449
Alexandria pd.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.783
Detective Karen stradivarius.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.553
We got a call
from your secretary Porter

20:55.555 --> 20:57.488
to collect files and evidence
for a case transfer?

20:57.490 --> 20:58.689
Oh.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.524
Oh, yeah.

21:00.526 --> 21:01.826
Hold on one second.

21:01.828 --> 21:04.495
Boss, uh, did you hear that?
Stall.

21:04.497 --> 21:05.863
Are you sure that's
a good idea?

21:05.865 --> 21:08.366
Oh, just do it.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.434
(Car engine starts)

21:12.972 --> 21:14.772
I know, you're
the best, too.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.440
All right,
I'll talk to you soon.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.676
Dad, he's such a goofball.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.945
Hmm.
I'm sure you
hear this all the time,

21:20.947 --> 21:23.281
but, uh, stradivarius.

21:23.283 --> 21:25.049
That's a, that's an
interesting name.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.450
Like the violin?

21:26.452 --> 21:28.286
Yeah.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.354
But don't even think
about playing me.

21:31.591 --> 21:33.658
(Chuckles)

21:33.660 --> 21:36.327
Where's he going?

21:36.329 --> 21:39.430
I feel like we've taken
the last five left turns.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.499
He's just making sure
he's not being followed.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.501
Well, then maybe you
should slow down,

21:43.503 --> 21:44.935
give a little distance,

21:44.937 --> 21:47.605
change lanes for once.

21:48.741 --> 21:51.075
Ah, but you're
the boss, boss.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.610
Although when i
asked to tag along,

21:52.612 --> 21:54.679
I thought this was
gonna be more like,

21:54.681 --> 21:56.881
you know,
butch and Sundance.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.382
You're the quick draw,

21:58.384 --> 22:00.351
I'm the brains--
kind of co-equals.

22:00.353 --> 22:01.819
No, we're not.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.955
So what--
I'm Robin to your Batman?

22:04.957 --> 22:06.624
Is that why you
agreed to do this?

22:06.626 --> 22:08.993
Give me crap, remind me what
it's like to be at the bottom?

22:08.995 --> 22:10.594
No, I did it because you asked.

22:10.596 --> 22:13.397
Well, I told you
i wanted to see this through.

22:13.399 --> 22:15.566
Yeah, well, you usually do
that from your office.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.470
You're wondering
if I still got it.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.472
No, I'm not.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.941
Sounds like you are.

22:23.942 --> 22:26.409
No, I got nothing to prove,
except my innocence.

22:29.549 --> 22:30.981
<i> I may be calling plays</i>
<i> from the booth,</i>

22:30.983 --> 22:33.517
but I remember what it's like
taking hits on the field.

22:33.519 --> 22:35.519
Hell, I still got
a lot of moves.

22:35.521 --> 22:38.689
I've got moves you and
Secnav have yet to see.

22:40.093 --> 22:41.625
Okay, okay!
I'll shut up.

22:41.627 --> 22:42.593
Yeah, it's not that.

22:42.595 --> 22:44.962
Klugman stopped.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.537
So, I guess now we wait?

22:53.539 --> 22:54.572
Or?

22:54.574 --> 22:56.374
Or what?

22:56.376 --> 22:58.476
We go in?

22:58.477 --> 23:00.577
Or you can look up who
rents office space here.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.882
Got plenty of moves, huh?

23:04.884 --> 23:06.884
You're just mad because your
sorry-ass phone can't do this.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.552
Hmm.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.488
According to their web site,

23:10.490 --> 23:13.391
this building
has multiple occupants.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.425
Lawyer.

23:14.427 --> 23:15.926
Couple law officers, yeah.

23:15.928 --> 23:17.094
No, the lawyer.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.829
3:00.

23:20.133 --> 23:22.600
Why do beef and klugman
have the same lawyer?

23:22.602 --> 23:24.602
Think there's a connection
between the murder

23:24.604 --> 23:25.870
and the frame job on me?

23:25.872 --> 23:28.506
Uh, boys?
Yoo-hoo!

23:28.508 --> 23:29.974
Yeah, come on inside.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.711
I guess you can ask her.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.679
I'm on the line
with your boss' office

23:35.681 --> 23:37.648
about harassing my client.

23:37.650 --> 23:41.652
I told you we were following
that taxi too close.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.522
Damn.

23:53.566 --> 23:55.766
Well, it's not every day
the secretary of the Navy

23:55.768 --> 23:58.536
insists on stopping by.

23:58.538 --> 24:01.872
I think you just added
another zero to our settlement.

24:01.874 --> 24:04.575
So, klugman knew
he was being followed?

24:04.577 --> 24:05.943
No.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.879
But I had a hunch based on
some background checking.

24:08.881 --> 24:12.049
You and agent Gibbs
like to push boundaries.

24:12.051 --> 24:13.117
Well, as do you.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.185
Since you represent

24:14.187 --> 24:15.886
our prime suspect in a murder

24:15.888 --> 24:18.722
and the person that's
accusing him of that murder.

24:18.724 --> 24:21.892
Mr. carver and Mr. klugman
are two very different clients,

24:21.894 --> 24:23.627
with very different...

24:23.629 --> 24:26.096
Admittedly lucrative needs.

24:26.098 --> 24:28.632
So, there's no connection
between the two?

24:28.634 --> 24:29.700
No.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.669
I'm just greedy.

24:31.671 --> 24:32.837
Sue me.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.772
(Knocking)

24:34.774 --> 24:36.674
Madam secretary.

24:36.676 --> 24:38.843
On behalf of the U.S. Navy,
I'd like to apologize in person.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.978
And assure you there will be
no further incidents.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.646
That's kind of you.

24:42.648 --> 24:45.749
But it won't stop the press
conference that I'm planning.

24:45.751 --> 24:48.652
I was actually hoping that
you and I might have a word.

24:48.654 --> 24:49.737
By all means.

24:49.738 --> 24:50.821
I was just going
to get some coffee.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.990
Well, let me join you.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.559
Uh, anything for you two?

25:01.567 --> 25:03.100
Gibbs?

25:03.102 --> 25:04.902
Did the lawyer
just give us the room?

25:04.904 --> 25:05.936
Uh-huh.

25:05.938 --> 25:08.772
Want to look around?

25:10.843 --> 25:14.211
Security footage
of the robbery, ma'am.

25:14.213 --> 25:16.213
This is the man
you've been looking into?

25:16.215 --> 25:17.982
That's beef.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.283
He denies any involvement.

25:19.285 --> 25:21.218
Well, clearly he's lying.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.787
Vance: Madam secretary, you're
gonna have to trust me.

25:23.789 --> 25:25.789
I'm showing you
we're digging in the right hole.

25:25.791 --> 25:28.692
The robbery,
the murder, the frame job--

25:28.694 --> 25:30.861
we show they're connected,
we solve the case.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.596
Makes your explanation
to the secretary of defense

25:32.598 --> 25:35.065
much easier.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.735
Asking with enough rope to
hang yourself with, director?

25:37.737 --> 25:39.103
Yes, ma'am.

25:39.105 --> 25:41.238
Either way,
you'll have someone to blame.

25:41.240 --> 25:45.009
Secdef wants an answer
by end of business.

25:45.011 --> 25:47.611
That gives you three hours
to wrap this in a bow.

25:47.613 --> 25:49.580
Leon, you know
i care about you.

25:49.582 --> 25:52.716
But the case will be
transferred to Alexandria

25:52.718 --> 25:55.953
and I announce your retirement
first thing tomorrow.

25:55.955 --> 25:59.290
Agreed.

25:59.292 --> 26:01.592
Recording: Please hang up
and try your call again.

26:01.594 --> 26:04.895
Please hang up and try
your call again.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.631
Please hang up
and try your call again.

26:07.633 --> 26:08.899
Hey, you called?

26:08.901 --> 26:11.569
Yeah, like 20 minutes ago.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.637
I just now got
all the beeping to stop.

26:13.639 --> 26:15.105
Oh, sorry,
i got hung up.

26:15.107 --> 26:17.074
Had to convince that Alexandria
detective to come back.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.642
How'd you do that?

26:18.644 --> 26:20.044
Well, I told her
that her car

26:20.046 --> 26:21.812
wasn't big enough to
fit all the evidence.

26:21.814 --> 26:25.049
There's only
three little boxes.

26:25.051 --> 26:26.884
Oh, oops!
(Laughs)

26:26.886 --> 26:29.019
So, what do you got?

26:29.021 --> 26:32.189
The final toxicology
for seaman dokes

26:32.191 --> 26:34.158
seaman dokes.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.093
Anything to tie the drugs
that killed him to a source?

26:36.095 --> 26:38.362
Yeah, dmso.

26:38.364 --> 26:41.065
It's a substance that's
sometimes added to drugs

26:41.067 --> 26:42.766
to make them absorb
through the skin.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.802
Faster high.
Is it traceable?

26:44.804 --> 26:46.670
Well, I can match
the chemical makeup,

26:46.672 --> 26:48.973
if you can get me
the original drugs.

26:48.975 --> 26:51.075
Well, I need a search warrant
for beef's back room first.

26:51.077 --> 26:52.943
I have something
to help with that.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.278
You should've
started with that.

26:54.280 --> 26:57.214
I did, like,
20 minutes ago.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.383
So, I found this little tracker

26:59.385 --> 27:01.752
inside the lining.

27:01.754 --> 27:04.054
I was so busy looking
for something high-tech,

27:04.056 --> 27:06.090
that I almost
missed the low-tech.

27:06.092 --> 27:08.292
Rather than sending out
some big GPS signal,

27:08.294 --> 27:10.027
this little guy uses Bluetooth.

27:10.029 --> 27:11.395
Oh, like a cell
phone headset?

27:11.397 --> 27:13.964
Yeah, except you'll
attach this to, like,

27:13.966 --> 27:17.101
say, your keys or a suitcase
in case they get lost,

27:17.103 --> 27:19.236
then your cell phone
can track it.

27:19.238 --> 27:22.139
What if your bag of cash
is at NCIS headquarters?

27:22.141 --> 27:24.141
If this device
comes within range

27:24.143 --> 27:27.711
of anyone that has a matching
cell phone application,

27:27.713 --> 27:29.847
it can send the signal
to that phone.

27:29.849 --> 27:32.983
Meaning it could use your phone
to tell someone the bag is here?

27:32.985 --> 27:35.719
Not it "could," it did.

27:35.721 --> 27:36.987
You backtracked the tracker?

27:36.989 --> 27:38.288
I hacked the tracker.

27:38.290 --> 27:39.790
All I need is a name.

27:39.792 --> 27:43.127
I don't have a name, but...

27:43.129 --> 27:45.095
I can tell you
where the person

27:45.097 --> 27:46.930
who is tracking
the money is located.

27:49.402 --> 27:51.168
"Kelly's closet & lingerie."

27:51.170 --> 27:52.403
Is that good enough
for a warrant?

27:52.405 --> 27:54.405
Yes!
Thank you!

27:54.407 --> 27:56.073
We found this

27:56.075 --> 27:58.242
underneath the boxes.

27:58.244 --> 28:00.044
What a pain in
the ass to open.

28:00.046 --> 28:02.913
For good reason,
based on what we found inside.

28:02.915 --> 28:05.249
Pills, cocaine, LSD.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.084
Yeah.
(Clears his throat)

28:07.086 --> 28:09.353
I'll wait for my lawyer.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.021
It's no wonder seaman dokes

28:11.023 --> 28:13.924
knew about your operation
and the money.

28:13.926 --> 28:16.226
You were his dad's drug dealer.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.295
I told you I have an alibi

28:18.297 --> 28:20.297
for the time of that car crash.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.166
Oh, that's right,
so how could you

28:22.168 --> 28:24.068
have possibly
drugged seaman dokes.

28:24.070 --> 28:25.736
That stumped us.

28:25.738 --> 28:27.137
But then we figured it out.

28:27.139 --> 28:29.173
Lawyer.

28:29.175 --> 28:31.241
I know, well, she's taking
her time, isn't she?

28:31.243 --> 28:32.743
While we wait,

28:32.745 --> 28:34.812
I was thinking
maybe McGee and I

28:34.814 --> 28:36.047
might do a little
reenactment.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.281
And you can tell us
how close we are.

28:37.283 --> 28:39.383
McGee will play the part

28:39.385 --> 28:41.485
of the grenade-wielding dokes.

28:41.487 --> 28:44.154
And I'll be a
better looking you.

28:44.156 --> 28:46.290
So, here's
what we think went down.

28:46.292 --> 28:48.258
You're getting the
money out of the safe,

28:48.260 --> 28:50.461
while dokes is
threatening you.

28:50.463 --> 28:52.096
Give me the money.

28:52.098 --> 28:54.164
Well, I think he had to be
a little more convincing

28:54.166 --> 28:58.235
than that, 'cause you...
Gave him the money.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.104
You had more than that
up your sleeve, though.

29:00.106 --> 29:03.073
Or should I say in
the palm of your hand.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.308
Tony, that's really tight.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.243
That's 'cause I'm
in character.

29:06.245 --> 29:09.146
And it has to be tight
to transfer the LSD.

29:11.217 --> 29:13.450
These blotters
also came from the safe.

29:13.452 --> 29:17.121
Wax-lined, so only dokes
got the dope.

29:17.123 --> 29:20.224
The dmso that you
spike your LSD with

29:20.226 --> 29:21.425
made it easy to absorb.

29:21.427 --> 29:23.160
That much, that fast.

29:23.162 --> 29:25.329
You signed that kid's
death certificate

29:25.331 --> 29:26.463
before he even got the money.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.132
(Laughs)

29:28.134 --> 29:30.267
You know how
crazy that sounds?

29:30.269 --> 29:32.336
How-how could you possibly know

29:32.338 --> 29:35.305
exactly what went on, hmm?

29:35.307 --> 29:38.142
Lucky guess?

29:39.278 --> 29:42.112
A guess backed up by science.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.281
Drugs we found in the safe,

29:44.283 --> 29:45.949
were an exact chemical match

29:45.951 --> 29:47.818
to the ones found
in the victim's system.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.053
You drugged him, then planned
to recover the money

29:50.055 --> 29:51.421
with a tracking device.

29:51.423 --> 29:53.857
But before that device
could send a signal out,

29:53.859 --> 29:55.826
NCIS was already on the scene.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.327
"Tracking device"?

29:57.329 --> 29:58.962
In the money?

29:58.964 --> 30:01.865
In the bag, and
it goes both ways.

30:01.867 --> 30:04.468
And it led us to you.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.870
And that's why I don't use them.

30:06.872 --> 30:08.172
Ever!

30:08.174 --> 30:10.274
So, I want to know
who the hell's

30:10.276 --> 30:11.975
been tracking my money!

30:11.977 --> 30:13.310
Oh, so it is your money?

30:13.312 --> 30:15.212
Theoretically,

30:15.214 --> 30:17.481
let's say yes.

30:17.483 --> 30:20.250
Theoretically, who else
had access to the bag?

30:20.252 --> 30:22.152
Just me.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.987
And the only time
it ever gets unlocked,

30:23.989 --> 30:26.957
is when I add money or when i--

30:28.894 --> 30:30.327
(groans)

30:30.329 --> 30:32.329
When I pay lump
for guarding the door

30:32.331 --> 30:34.198
at the end of the night.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.999
Does lump have a real name?

30:36.001 --> 30:38.569
Well, probably.

30:38.571 --> 30:42.272
But it's not like I issue w-2's.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.274
That's the connection.

30:44.276 --> 30:47.244
The doorman and klugman
are working together.

30:47.246 --> 30:49.346
They were already
planning to rob the place.

30:49.348 --> 30:50.848
The kid beat him to it.

30:50.850 --> 30:52.850
I know klugman.

30:52.852 --> 30:54.251
He's still looking
for a big payday.

30:54.253 --> 30:57.254
Ms. Sciuto said somebody's
still tracking the money.

30:57.256 --> 30:58.589
Cash is in evidence.

30:58.591 --> 31:00.490
Evidence that's
about to be moved.

31:00.492 --> 31:02.326
Klugman's a former agent.

31:02.328 --> 31:03.994
He knew that by framing me,

31:03.996 --> 31:06.296
we'd be forced
to transfer the case.

31:06.298 --> 31:10.234
Klugman's planning to rob
the evidence in transport.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.402
Leon, we don't know that.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.471
One way to find out.

31:26.252 --> 31:28.018
Vance:
<i> If we're right,</i>

31:28.020 --> 31:30.220
<i> and klugman robs us,</i>

31:30.222 --> 31:31.955
how do you think
he's gonna do it?

31:31.957 --> 31:35.325
You don't know klugman's
gonna be the one to show.

31:35.327 --> 31:38.595
Well, I didn't hear
any better ideas.

31:38.597 --> 31:41.231
Why'd you come
if you didn't like the risk?

31:41.233 --> 31:43.233
Oh, I don't mind the risk.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.168
No.

31:45.170 --> 31:47.237
I mind you.

31:47.239 --> 31:50.107
'Cause I'm just a politician?

31:50.109 --> 31:52.142
You said you had
nothing to prove.

31:52.144 --> 31:54.211
Damn right.
Well, you're not
acting like it.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.447
The job changes, Leon.

31:57.449 --> 31:59.349
We change.

31:59.351 --> 32:03.053
Better or for worse.

32:03.055 --> 32:05.255
I'm gonna personally nail
this s.O.B. A second time.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.390
(Loud thudding)

32:06.392 --> 32:08.191
Okay, okay, we're on.

32:08.193 --> 32:10.260
That's how they're
gonna do it, huh?

32:17.269 --> 32:19.369
Get out of the vehicle!
Put your hands on your head!

32:19.371 --> 32:21.338
No weapons!
He's alone.

32:21.340 --> 32:22.572
Damn.

32:22.574 --> 32:25.042
Klugman's got lump
doing his dirt work.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.143
So we take him out.

32:26.145 --> 32:28.145
No, no. No time.

32:28.146 --> 32:30.146
Klugman will be long gone by the
time we get this guy to flip.

32:30.149 --> 32:31.281
You got a better idea?

32:31.283 --> 32:32.316
Enough talking!

32:32.318 --> 32:33.417
Put the guns on the dashboard!

32:33.419 --> 32:35.152
Get out now!

32:35.154 --> 32:37.521
Yeah, we do as he says,
we get robbed,

32:37.523 --> 32:40.290
and we track the money
back to klugman.

32:49.301 --> 32:52.135
Gibbs, what
are you doing?

32:52.137 --> 32:53.603
There you go.

32:53.605 --> 32:55.605
Come around.

32:55.607 --> 32:57.040
Come on this side.

32:58.344 --> 32:59.609
Move to the back of the Van.

32:59.611 --> 33:01.011
(Dog barking in distance)

33:02.247 --> 33:04.181
You'll get no
problems out of us.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.350
Right, partner?

33:07.720 --> 33:09.386
Okay.

33:09.388 --> 33:10.721
Okay, that's good.

33:10.723 --> 33:12.255
Stop right there.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.459
Open the door.

33:15.461 --> 33:18.261
Show me the cash.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.340
Man:
Okay, good.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.776
Put the money back,
slide over the box.

33:34.279 --> 33:37.514
We're gonna let him
take the box, right, Gibbs?

33:37.516 --> 33:39.349
No trouble, right?

33:39.351 --> 33:42.319
Depends on him.

33:43.288 --> 33:45.622
Hey, he's got a gun in his back.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.192
Sorry, Gibbs,

33:49.194 --> 33:50.627
we're gonna
do this my way.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.462
Your partner's
a smart man.

33:52.464 --> 33:55.265
Take his gun and toss it.
Slowly.

33:55.267 --> 33:56.533
Turn around.

34:05.778 --> 34:08.445
Okay, good.
Now it's just one more thing.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.380
My tracking device.

34:10.382 --> 34:13.316
Excuse me?
I'm not stupid.
I used it

34:13.318 --> 34:16.319
to track you here-- I'm
not gonna let you do the same.

34:16.321 --> 34:19.256
Throw it away
and toss over the box.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.228
Yeah.

34:33.238 --> 34:35.138
Okay.

34:36.375 --> 34:38.108
Head to the side of the Van.

34:39.078 --> 34:41.244
Face it.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.580
Beautiful.

34:43.582 --> 34:46.650
Doing great.
All right, you've been helpful.

34:48.454 --> 34:49.786
(Car door opens)

34:49.788 --> 34:51.288
(Door closes)

34:51.290 --> 34:52.289
(Engine starts)

34:52.291 --> 34:54.357
(Tires squeal)

34:56.728 --> 34:59.463
Don't go after him.
I'm picking up my weapon.

34:59.465 --> 35:01.331
All right, look,

35:01.333 --> 35:02.399
about the gun, I was just...

35:02.401 --> 35:05.402
Don't.
Tony:
So, what happened?

35:05.404 --> 35:07.337
We were in position,
waiting for your signal.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.272
We need to follow the money
back to klugman.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.141
He dumped the tracker.

35:11.143 --> 35:13.243
Yeah, that's, uh,
that was my bad.

35:13.245 --> 35:14.928
You think?

35:14.929 --> 35:16.612
Well, getting mad at me's not
gonna help us track the money.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.548
Well, my sorry-ass
phone will.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.117
Your phone?

35:20.119 --> 35:22.586
Gibbs:
Yeah, my phone.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.588
You put your phone
in the evidence box?

35:24.590 --> 35:26.256
No.

35:26.258 --> 35:27.591
He had me do it.

35:27.593 --> 35:30.293
Before you two even came
into the evidence garage.

35:30.295 --> 35:33.630
So what, you knew I'd be
too focused on klugman?

35:34.466 --> 35:36.466
Leon, it happens.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.702
DiNozzo,
give me the keys.

35:41.206 --> 35:44.608
Man (In distance):
Everything?
Man 2: Everything that mattered.

35:44.610 --> 35:47.577
(Conversation continues
indistinctly)

35:49.314 --> 35:51.414
(Quietly):
I knew the lawyer was connected.

35:51.416 --> 35:52.682
Get me a sitrep.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.251
(Conversation continues
indistinctly)

35:54.253 --> 35:55.785
(Whispers):
Okay, we're in position.

35:55.787 --> 35:57.487
Ready to flush them
your way.

35:57.489 --> 36:00.423
(Men continue conversing
indistinctly)

36:04.563 --> 36:06.229
(Laura speaks indistinctly)

36:06.231 --> 36:08.165
He's not my first choice,
either...

36:08.167 --> 36:09.833
Okay, who's
going in first?

36:11.503 --> 36:15.739
You, of course-- I meant,
how do you want to do this?

36:17.843 --> 36:20.310
Laura:
All right, guys,
it's all confirmed.

36:20.312 --> 36:22.179
These are the details.

36:22.181 --> 36:24.581
There'll be a ship waiting
in Newport, the<i> monte cristo.</i>

36:24.583 --> 36:26.416
Ask for a man named Cortez.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.402
He'll take cash,

36:28.403 --> 36:30.387
but I suggest you make
the rest last for a while.

36:30.389 --> 36:34.291
Well, Cuban peso's
currently down.

36:34.293 --> 36:37.294
For your services
as travel agent.

36:37.296 --> 36:39.663
A settlement could have netted
more than this,

36:39.665 --> 36:41.565
but... we all make
our own choices.

36:41.567 --> 36:43.400
Yeah.
Hey, what is this?

36:45.737 --> 36:46.636
Damn!

36:47.573 --> 36:49.372
What's Gibbs
waiting for?

36:49.374 --> 36:51.875
Maybe he finally
shot the director.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.243
(Gunshot)

36:53.245 --> 36:54.945
(Loud clattering, man yells)

36:58.350 --> 37:01.384
Tony:
NCIS! Federal agents! Gibbs?

37:01.386 --> 37:02.586
Director?

37:02.588 --> 37:03.954
All clear, agent DiNozzo.

37:03.956 --> 37:05.322
What happened?

37:05.323 --> 37:06.689
Call an ambulance.
I'm not saying anything,

37:06.692 --> 37:08.225
and I'm advising

37:08.227 --> 37:09.459
my client to do the same.

37:09.461 --> 37:11.861
Klugman:
Just get off me!
Shut up, keep still.

37:11.863 --> 37:14.698
You're lucky your friend uses
only a nine-millimeter,

37:14.700 --> 37:16.566
otherwise I'd be really upset.

37:16.568 --> 37:17.968
(Gasps)
McGee.

37:18.937 --> 37:21.338
Gibbs,

37:21.340 --> 37:22.739
I just remembered
something.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.808
I didn't lose my edge;

37:24.809 --> 37:26.876
I became a politician 'cause
I'd had enough of this crap.

37:26.878 --> 37:29.980
(Sighs): Is that what
we're gonna tell Secnav?

37:29.982 --> 37:32.882
(Siren approaching)

37:32.884 --> 37:34.818
(Exhales)

37:36.855 --> 37:38.321
(Groans)

37:38.323 --> 37:40.957
(Indistinct radio chatter)

37:40.959 --> 37:43.393
Bodies and news vans.

37:43.395 --> 37:45.629
Hardly clean, Gibbs.

37:45.631 --> 37:47.764
We transferred the case,
just like you said.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.466
I drove the truck myself.

37:49.468 --> 37:50.734
Tony: Gibbs called us
when the truck

37:50.736 --> 37:52.302
was robbed.
We tracked it here.

37:52.304 --> 37:53.637
Bad guys
shot first.

37:54.873 --> 37:57.274
Case closed, as promised.

37:57.276 --> 37:58.975
Vance:
Sorry I'm late.

37:58.977 --> 38:01.544
I, uh, got the message--
i tried to get here

38:01.546 --> 38:03.713
as quickly as I could.
Uh, what did I miss?

38:03.715 --> 38:06.016
You're bleeding.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.855
Made a mistake.

38:13.058 --> 38:16.960
I forgot to trust my
agents to do their job.

38:16.962 --> 38:20.063
And in the process,
i forgot what<i> my</i> job was.

38:20.065 --> 38:22.699
It won't happen
again, ma'am.

38:22.701 --> 38:24.334
I gave up being an agent

38:24.336 --> 38:27.704
so I could lead and
protect this agency.

38:27.706 --> 38:30.640
That's where I could
make a difference.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.776
It's where I still can.

38:36.815 --> 38:40.383
So you inspire loyalty
in your agents.

38:40.385 --> 38:43.687
Loyalty to the point
of stupidity sometimes...

38:43.689 --> 38:46.623
But loyalty nonetheless.

38:46.625 --> 38:50.560
So if I have
to fire you tomorrow...

38:50.562 --> 38:52.796
They'll be upset.

38:59.071 --> 39:01.071
¶ ¶

39:08.814 --> 39:11.815
bishop:
Well, all the evidence,

39:11.817 --> 39:16.720
including the $262,020,

39:16.722 --> 39:19.622
is now safely
with Alexandria pd.

39:19.624 --> 39:21.925
Guess that means they'll take
the win and "absorb" the money.

39:21.927 --> 39:24.494
Mm, the win, yes,

39:24.496 --> 39:28.131
but... I made a deal
about the money with kiki.

39:28.133 --> 39:31.067
"Kiki"?
Yeah, detective stradivarius.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.470
We got to talking,
and agreed that both agencies

39:33.472 --> 39:34.738
would apply for the money

39:34.740 --> 39:37.107
to go to the drug rehab clinic
at Walter Reed.

39:37.109 --> 39:40.610
It might be the only good
to come of all this.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.813
Gibbs and Vance?

39:43.815 --> 39:45.982
On their way up from
a meeting with Secnav.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.851
After they left
the Pentagon,

39:47.853 --> 39:49.586
she called a press conference.

39:49.588 --> 39:52.956
To announce the case win
or to fire director Vance?

39:52.958 --> 39:55.959
(Elevator bell dings)
Still waiting to hear.

40:12.077 --> 40:15.011
Yes, I'm still in charge.
Now, get back to work.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.520
You're stuck with me.

40:25.490 --> 40:27.557
Change is hard.
