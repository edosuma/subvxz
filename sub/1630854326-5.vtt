00:09.593 --> 00:13.472
Welcome to beautiful Acapulco.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.599
Yeah, this place sucks.

00:15.599 --> 00:17.976
I mean, why are we here?

00:19.061 --> 00:20.771
This was my playground growing up.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.900
Memo and I came down here all the time.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.778
We'd always catch-- What's the word?

00:28.278 --> 00:29.571
Tetanus?
-Snapper.

00:30.072 --> 00:35.702
Plus, later on in my story,
I'm gonna use this marina as a metaphor.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.746
A metaphor. Wow, exciting.

00:37.746 --> 00:41.917
I know, right?
A good metaphor is catnip to me.

00:42.501 --> 00:47.256
So, the night of Valentine's Day,
I came home after seeing Isabel.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.474
<i>The fact that Roberta's letters were out</i>

00:57.474 --> 00:59.476
<i>could only mean one thing.</i>

01:00.727 --> 01:04.147
<i>My mom had found the letters
and discovered my sister's secret.</i>

01:20.831 --> 01:21.790
Don't say anything,

01:21.790 --> 01:22.875
just listen.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.793
I know you're sad,

01:24.793 --> 01:26.628
but everything is going to be okay.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.046
I am here for you.

01:28.881 --> 01:30.424
I love you.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.967
Aww. I love you too.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.599
What's happening?

01:38.599 --> 01:39.641
Where's Sara?

01:39.641 --> 01:41.727
I assume she's with your
"ex girlfriend" Roberta.

01:41.727 --> 01:42.978
Mom, I can explain--

01:42.978 --> 01:44.229
Oh, don't worry.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.689
Your sister
already explained everything!

01:45.814 --> 01:47.191
She also said that she hates me,

01:47.191 --> 01:50.277
because apparently wanting your
kids to be perfect is wrong.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.362
But what did you say to her?

01:52.362 --> 01:54.239
We need to talk about
this, as a family.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.782
That's exactly what I was telling her.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.036
Quietly. With some stammering.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.370
Well, rather I thought about it.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.747
You may not know this about me,

02:01.747 --> 02:03.373
but I don't like confrontation.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.460
Sorry.
-I have nothing to say to Sara,

02:06.460 --> 02:08.086
until she apologizes to me.

02:08.086 --> 02:10.380
She thinks she can just throw
a tantrum and leave?

02:10.380 --> 02:11.507
Oh no.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.050
When she comes back,

02:13.050 --> 02:14.760
she'll find that
I got rid of everything of hers

02:14.760 --> 02:16.553
that led her to deviate
into that lifestyle.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.805
Mom. It's not a lifestyle...

02:19.139 --> 02:21.600
This record player has to go.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.060
Who knows what kind of

02:23.060 --> 02:25.270
God-forsaken music she's listening to.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.064
Yes! That's a good idea.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.816
Hey, didn't your record
player just break?

02:31.318 --> 02:32.819
Oooh, you know what...

02:32.819 --> 02:33.987
I think it might have...

02:41.620 --> 02:43.789
Hey, that shouldn't be there.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.082
Thanks.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.088
Excuse me.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.382
What are you--

02:53.674 --> 02:55.008
Aren't you Máximo's sister?

02:55.008 --> 02:56.593
Wait... did you sleep here?!

02:58.679 --> 02:59.596
Hi!

03:00.264 --> 03:04.434
Máximo, did you lose something,
like a sister?

03:04.434 --> 03:05.519
Sara.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.687
How'd you get into the resort?

03:06.687 --> 03:09.022
I waited till the guard had to use
the restroom,

03:09.022 --> 03:10.232
then walked in.

03:10.232 --> 03:12.693
Guillermo's small
bladder strikes again.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.948
Mom told me what happened.
I'm so sorry.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.616
We need to talk about it as a family!

03:19.616 --> 03:20.701
I have nothing to say to mom

03:20.701 --> 03:22.244
until she apologizes to me.

03:22.244 --> 03:23.579
I don't know what I'm going to do,

03:23.579 --> 03:25.205
but I'm not going home.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.172
So, my sister and my mom
had a fight,

03:33.172 --> 03:34.047
and I was wondering--

03:34.214 --> 03:36.550
She already asked. You know
she can't stay here...

03:36.550 --> 03:37.634
Julia, please.

03:37.634 --> 03:38.969
She has nowhere else to go.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.346
She has no job, no money
and she's only sixteen!

03:44.141 --> 03:45.434
Practically seventeen.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.522
Okay. Yes. Some rooms in
the north wing are empty.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.149
But they're starting renovations tomorrow.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.776
She can only stay here one night maximum.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.322
It's Máximo.
And thank you. You're the best.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.077
Hey.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.001
You're lucky...

04:11.001 --> 04:13.212
The only room available today is a suite.

04:13.212 --> 04:15.422
Thank you. But I don't need much.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.591
It's crazy how much
capitalism tries to convince us

04:17.591 --> 04:19.968
that we need extravagant things.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.554
My position on it
has always been the same-

04:23.388 --> 04:25.516
JESUS CHRIST!

04:25.641 --> 04:27.226
Wow.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.091
<i>I was worried about my family,</i>

04:59.091 --> 05:02.094
<i>but I knew there was one person
who could always cheer me up.</i>

05:02.094 --> 05:04.388
Happy 30th anniversary,
Mr. and Mrs. Nelly.

05:04.388 --> 05:07.182
May your days be filled with joy.
I couldn't be more thrilled for you.

05:07.850 --> 05:10.018
<i>Okay, maybe not always.</i>

05:10.519 --> 05:11.812
What's wrong?

05:11.812 --> 05:14.898
I just miss Lorena so much my heart hurts.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.693
It's been so long
I'm starting to forget her face.

05:17.693 --> 05:19.653
You said goodbye to Lorena last night.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.573
I know,
but it feels like it's been two nights.

05:26.869 --> 05:29.037
Oh, my God. Look at this.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.165
Hugo Sánchez is here in town?

05:32.165 --> 05:34.543
My favorite football player!

05:34.543 --> 05:36.086
This is so cool.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.422
Imagine meeting him.

05:41.633 --> 05:44.803
Memo, I'm not gonna let you stay down
about Lorena.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.680
You've cheered me up countless times.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.516
Well, tonight, I'm gonna be your Memo!

05:49.516 --> 05:51.018
You're gonna be my me?
-Yep!

05:51.018 --> 05:53.437
I'm gonna do all the things
that you do for me when I'm down.

05:53.437 --> 05:57.149
Like saying, "You can do anything.
You are Máximo Gallardo."

05:57.149 --> 05:59.943
Exactly! Except I'm gonna use your name
instead of mine.

05:59.943 --> 06:02.613
That is such a smart adjustment.

06:02.613 --> 06:04.990
So, what are we going to do?

06:05.490 --> 06:07.326
We are going to meet Hugo Sánchez.

06:07.326 --> 06:11.538
Every time he's here, he goes to that club
in La Costera, Beach Baby.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.875
So tonight, that's where we're going.

06:15.626 --> 06:16.710
Boys' night out.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.795
Boys' night out!

06:19.379 --> 06:22.090
Oh, but I'm supposed to do something
with Isabel tonight.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.970
Boys' night out plus Isabel. Eh?

06:32.100 --> 06:33.852
Chad, how can I help you?

06:33.852 --> 06:37.981
Well, sorry to interrupt, but I have
a fairly complicated favor to ask.

06:38.524 --> 06:41.109
God, why do you punish me?

06:41.109 --> 06:43.695
Of course. What do you need?

06:43.695 --> 06:47.449
So, I had my favorite deejay lined up
for our wedding,

06:47.449 --> 06:49.117
but he just canceled on us.

06:49.117 --> 06:55.207
So, Julia booked a salsa band,
but I don't know how to dance salsa.

06:59.837 --> 07:00.838
So...

07:02.339 --> 07:04.842
Well, maybe--

07:04.842 --> 07:06.802
I would probably ask Beto.

07:06.802 --> 07:10.264
Yeah, that's so funny because I just
asked Beto, and he told me to ask you.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.516
That is funny.
-Yeah.

07:12.516 --> 07:16.520
Maybe ask Héctor.
-I also asked Héctor. He also said... you.

07:20.274 --> 07:21.191
Have you tried asking--

07:21.191 --> 07:23.527
Everyone said that you're the best dancer
at Las Colinas.

07:23.527 --> 07:26.196
God, why do you punish me this way?!

07:27.406 --> 07:29.867
I'll give you one lesson tonight.

07:29.867 --> 07:32.870
Before then, I want you to wash my car.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.164
I saw the <i>Karate Kid</i>. Is that--

07:36.164 --> 07:38.000
Is that how I'm gonna learn
these dance moves?

07:38.000 --> 07:41.170
No, that's how I get my car clean.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.089
I'm not doing this shit for free.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.304
Hey, Mom! Just came home to change,
I won't be having dinner at ho--

07:55.559 --> 07:59.521
Mom, what did you do? This looks
like where a nun goes to be sad.

07:59.521 --> 08:00.480
Good.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.483
When Sara gets home,

08:03.483 --> 08:06.069
I want her sole focus to be
on asking Jesus for forgiveness.

08:08.780 --> 08:11.283
That's not Jesus, that's
Barry Gibb from the Bee Gees.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.455
They were selling it outside of
church, I just assumed.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.458
I confessed my darkest
secrets to the Bee Gees?

08:20.250 --> 08:22.794
I can't be here. This doesn't even feel
like Sara's room.

08:23.879 --> 08:25.297
It breaks my heart.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.552
Did we overdo it?

08:31.803 --> 08:33.804
I wish we hadn't
thrown away her things.

08:34.722 --> 08:38.477
Actually, I didn't throw anything away.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.395
I put all the boxes in my
apartment instead. Just in case.

08:41.605 --> 08:44.733
Seriously? So we can put the room back
exactly the way it was?

08:45.651 --> 08:46.485
Thank you!

08:46.985 --> 08:49.363
Okay. Let's do it quickly, she'll
probably be home any minute now.

08:49.947 --> 08:50.781
Thank you!

08:51.949 --> 08:55.577
Poor Sara. She must be having a
terrible time without her mother.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.028
<i>Hugo, in the 1980s,</i>

09:30.028 --> 09:33.240
<i>the nightlife in Acapulco was unrivaled.</i>

09:33.240 --> 09:37.452
<i>The rich and famous came from Mexico City
just to party all weekend.</i>

09:37.995 --> 09:40.372
<i>I had no idea if we could get in,</i>

09:40.372 --> 09:43.876
<i>but Memo needed cheering up,
so I had to try.</i>

09:43.876 --> 09:45.502
Thanks for inviting me guys.

09:45.502 --> 09:48.922
I really hope we get to see this
soccer player that I don't care about.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.466
I like her. She's funny.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.805
Not you two.

09:56.805 --> 09:57.931
But we're with her!

09:57.931 --> 09:59.975
I don't care. You're not getting in.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.563
This is hopeless. Maybe we should just go.

10:04.563 --> 10:07.983
We have a long day at Las Colinas
tomorrow.

10:07.983 --> 10:11.570
Wait, you guys work at Las Colinas?

10:11.570 --> 10:13.071
Next time lead with that.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.577
<i>Hold on. That did not happen.</i>

10:18.577 --> 10:20.329
<i>Actually, Hugo, it did.</i>

10:20.329 --> 10:22.789
It turns out that working at Las Colinas

10:22.789 --> 10:26.251
made us part of a community
of high-end service workers.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.253
We all looked out for each other.

10:49.233 --> 10:52.027
You know those jerks in these clubs,

10:52.027 --> 10:53.487
who always get to skip the line

10:53.487 --> 10:55.405
and think they're better
than everyone else?

10:55.405 --> 10:57.407
Tonight we're those jerks!

10:59.243 --> 11:01.912
I checked out the whole place.
No sign of Hugo Sánchez.

11:01.912 --> 11:06.625
That's fine. It's still early. We're gonna
make sure you have a great time, Memo.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.627
Let's just get a drink and wait.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.799
Wait. I want to try something.

11:13.799 --> 11:16.927
Hi. We work at Las Colinas.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.095
At Las Colinas?

11:18.720 --> 11:20.264
Anyone who works there
is a friend of ours.

11:20.264 --> 11:22.391
You're drinking for free tonight!

12:13.483 --> 12:17.529
One, two, three. One, two three.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.907
One, two, three. One, two, three.
-Slow down.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.034
One, two, three. One, two, three.

12:22.034 --> 12:24.077
One, two, three. Chad!
-You're hurting me.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.120
It's very easy.

12:25.120 --> 12:28.207
One, two, three.
-That's what I'm doing. One, two, three.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.628
You need to loosen up.

12:32.628 --> 12:34.421
Well, I'm trying, but you're terrifying.

12:34.421 --> 12:38.258
Your problem is that you are not leading.
You are following.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.927
I'm following
because I don't know where I'm going.

12:39.927 --> 12:42.304
You're following because you are insecure.

12:42.304 --> 12:45.682
You need more confidence in your step,
in yourself.

12:45.682 --> 12:46.850
Be the leader.

12:46.850 --> 12:50.729
I'm happy to lead. I just need somebody
a little bit ahead of me showing me how.

12:51.355 --> 12:53.315
That's called following!

12:53.315 --> 12:54.733
Let's try again.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.194
Geez.

13:04.076 --> 13:06.370
What a great night!

13:06.370 --> 13:08.288
Thanks so much, guys.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.499
Should we go home?

13:12.167 --> 13:16.713
Home? No. We have to keep
waiting for Hugo Sánchez!

13:22.010 --> 13:23.679
What's that noise?

13:23.679 --> 13:25.389
I don't know but...

13:25.722 --> 13:27.224
It sounds like it's coming from...

13:27.224 --> 13:28.851
the future.

13:28.851 --> 13:31.061
It's almost as if years later,

13:31.436 --> 13:33.355
someone is telling a story
about this moment,

13:33.647 --> 13:36.692
but their inconsiderate nephew
didn't mute their telephone...

13:38.527 --> 13:40.863
Okay, I get it. I'm sorry.

13:42.239 --> 13:43.282
Hey, Mom.

13:43.282 --> 13:45.826
Hey!
You forgot to text me when you landed.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.661
Sorry. Uncle Máximo was just telling me

13:47.661 --> 13:50.205
about the time you got into a huge fight
with my <i>abuela</i>

13:50.205 --> 13:52.082
and spent an awesome day at the resort.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.877
<i>Your uncle never gets the stories right.</i>

13:54.877 --> 13:57.796
Hey! I sometimes get the stories right.

13:57.796 --> 14:02.176
Yes, I had fun at the resort.
But I also had a lot on my mind.

14:02.176 --> 14:07.139
In fact, there's a part of my stay
that I never told anyone about.

14:07.139 --> 14:11.226
You see, I couldn't stop replaying
that fight with my mom in my head.

14:11.935 --> 14:15.814
<i>And she'd ask me, how could I be so sure
that I didn't like boys</i>

14:15.814 --> 14:17.691
<i>if I had never even tried.</i>

14:17.691 --> 14:20.986
<i>Was she right?
Could this all just be a phase,</i>

14:20.986 --> 14:24.364
<i>and meeting the right guy
could knock me out of it?</i>

14:36.210 --> 14:40.881
<i>That's when I decided that
if there was ever a place to meet a guy,</i>

14:40.881 --> 14:43.967
<i>it was there at Las Colinas.</i>

15:03.529 --> 15:04.988
Hi mamacita.

15:07.241 --> 15:08.700
Gross!

15:11.912 --> 15:15.499
I'm sorry you had to witness that,
men can be disgusting.

15:15.958 --> 15:19.503
They sure can.
Haven't found the exception yet.

15:19.670 --> 15:22.256
Well, let me introduce myself.

15:22.256 --> 15:23.924
I'm Daniel.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.052
I'm getting a call from a client.
I'll be right back.

15:27.052 --> 15:28.136
No! Hey, hey, hey!

15:28.637 --> 15:31.223
Talk about an unreliable narrator.

15:32.850 --> 15:35.060
Anyway, back in the club...

15:35.060 --> 15:37.896
Why don't we go back to the
restaurant and have a late dinner?

15:38.063 --> 15:41.024
Yeah! And maybe I could use the
restaurant's phone to call Lorena.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.568
I'm sure she's still awake.

15:42.568 --> 15:45.320
No! I need to help you, remember?

15:45.863 --> 15:49.241
So... I have to miss a call with
Lorena so you can help me feel

15:49.241 --> 15:52.035
better about missing Lorena?

15:52.035 --> 15:54.496
Exactly! I'm being your Memo!

15:54.496 --> 16:00.919
I know. I'm just not sure you're being
my me to me the way I'd be your me to you.

16:02.504 --> 16:04.423
Is everything okay, Máximo?

16:04.631 --> 16:06.049
Of course!

16:06.049 --> 16:07.801
We just can't give up.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.637
Yeah, I'm giving up. See you tomorrow.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.310
<i>Okay, I'm back. Where was I?</i>

16:16.310 --> 16:20.439
Hey! You can't just interrupt me.
Hugo wants to hear my story.

16:20.439 --> 16:23.275
<i>Are you kidding?
My mom once flirted with a guy.</i>

16:23.275 --> 16:24.860
I wanna hear what happened with that.

16:24.860 --> 16:25.944
Traitor.

16:25.944 --> 16:30.115
So, Daniel and I
spent the entire day together.

16:30.115 --> 16:35.329
<i>He was smart, funny, and he agreed with me
about everything I cared about.</i>

16:35.621 --> 16:38.290
I just feel like stay-at-home moms
deserve a paycheck too.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.125
Yes!

16:40.542 --> 16:42.252
In Dawn of the Dead,
they're running from zombies,

16:42.377 --> 16:45.047
but the real killer in
the movie is capitalism.

16:45.589 --> 16:46.507
Yes!

16:47.674 --> 16:51.094
Possums look like tiny devils
and I hate them.

16:51.386 --> 16:52.763
YES!

16:52.763 --> 16:55.265
<i>Right, right.
He hated possums. What a hunk.</i>

16:55.265 --> 16:56.808
<i>Anyway, back to Chad.</i>

16:59.436 --> 17:00.354
Two, three.

17:00.354 --> 17:01.480
Hey!

17:01.480 --> 17:03.899
One, two, three. One, two, three.

17:03.899 --> 17:05.233
Scoot. Scoot.

17:05.817 --> 17:08.403
Yeah!
-Great. One, two, three.

17:08.403 --> 17:10.239
Spin. Wonderful.

17:10.239 --> 17:12.406
One, two, three. All right!

17:12.406 --> 17:14.492
...two, three. One, two, three.
-Yes.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.369
Whoa! I'm doing it!

17:17.496 --> 17:20.165
Yeah! You did it!

17:20.165 --> 17:22.876
I did it!
-I felt your confidence in your step.

17:22.876 --> 17:26.213
You were a leader.
-I knew it. I can dance salsa.

17:26.213 --> 17:29.800
Not even close,
but now you are a little less terrible.

17:32.469 --> 17:33.971
"A little less terrible."

17:34.680 --> 17:35.681
I like it.

17:35.681 --> 17:39.142
<i>Anyway, my night with Daniel kept going.</i>

17:39.685 --> 17:41.854
<i>It was like a romantic movie.</i>

17:41.854 --> 17:44.940
Sara, I've never met anyone like you.

17:45.566 --> 17:47.860
You're confident,

17:47.860 --> 17:49.528
you're funny,

17:49.862 --> 17:51.780
your eyes are like the sunset.

17:52.406 --> 17:53.657
Sara,

17:54.074 --> 17:55.117
you're no doubt,

17:55.534 --> 17:59.037
the smartest person in your family--

17:59.037 --> 18:01.373
<i>He did not say that.</i>
-<i>How do you know?</i>

18:01.373 --> 18:03.458
Why do you have to make
things up in your stories?

18:03.458 --> 18:06.545
Half the things you tell
Hugo are lies!

18:06.962 --> 18:09.339
So you're admitting half the
things I tell him are true.

18:09.339 --> 18:11.341
That's not something to be proud of!

18:11.341 --> 18:13.302
<i>Anyway, as I was saying,</i>

18:14.595 --> 18:17.681
<i>we were looking
deep into each other's eyes.</i>

18:19.808 --> 18:23.228
<i>And then it happened.</i>

18:38.118 --> 18:40.412
Everything makes sense now.

18:40.871 --> 18:43.040
Yes! I feel the same way!

18:43.665 --> 18:46.668
I know we just met, and people
will say we're crazy,

18:47.044 --> 18:48.170
but I don't care--

18:48.712 --> 18:49.588
What?

18:49.588 --> 18:52.007
Whoa, what are you doing?! No!

18:52.549 --> 18:54.885
I mean, you're incredible, seriously.

18:55.469 --> 18:57.262
And don't take this the wrong way but,

18:57.554 --> 19:00.724
I don't want to kiss a man
ever again in my life.

19:04.603 --> 19:06.522
How do I take that the right way?

19:08.106 --> 19:10.943
<i>Suddenly I understood
why in elementary school</i>

19:10.943 --> 19:13.820
<i>I never wanted to play house with boys,</i>

19:13.820 --> 19:16.532
<i>why all my friends
were looking at John Travolta,</i>

19:16.532 --> 19:19.243
<i>but I couldn't stop looking
at Olivia Newton-John.</i>

19:20.035 --> 19:23.747
<i>So many moments where I thought
there was something wrong with me.</i>

19:24.248 --> 19:26.250
<i>Now it all made sense.</i>

19:26.250 --> 19:29.253
<i>I was finally sure of who I was.</i>

19:29.253 --> 19:31.797
<i>Yeah, yeah.
Most important moment of your life.</i>

19:31.797 --> 19:32.881
<i>Anyway, back to me.</i>

19:33.382 --> 19:37.344
It's all losers here now.
Can't we just go home?

19:37.344 --> 19:41.306
No! Hugo Sánchez will show up,
we just have to be patient.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.767
And where?
Show me one loser in this club.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.853
Hello, boys!

19:45.853 --> 19:46.937
Héctor!

19:46.937 --> 19:50.065
I'm surprised you can afford this club.

19:50.065 --> 19:52.484
They serve the most expensive
drinks in all of Acapulco.

19:52.484 --> 19:55.946
If they know you work at Las
Colinas, you get them for free.

19:57.698 --> 20:01.201
Of course. Of course I knew that.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.995
And what are you doing here?

20:02.995 --> 20:07.499
Well nothing, just looking for chicks!

20:10.169 --> 20:12.379
Actually, can I confess something?

20:13.088 --> 20:15.299
I'm trying to forget someone.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.759
Someone who broke my heart.

20:18.135 --> 20:21.054
I know I put on a big show, but deep down,

20:21.054 --> 20:24.558
I'm just a poor soul looking
to love and to be loved.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.562
Sorry, it's so loud in here, what?
We couldn't hear you!

20:28.562 --> 20:29.646
Oh! Nothing, nothing!

20:29.646 --> 20:31.481
I said I'm just looking for chicks!

20:31.481 --> 20:33.859
The night has definitely gone
south. Now can we go?

20:33.859 --> 20:35.277
No! Please stay!

20:35.277 --> 20:37.571
I'm trapped alone in
my tiny office all day,

20:37.571 --> 20:40.407
away from the sun, and people.

20:40.407 --> 20:43.118
Please... Stay, I'm so lonely.

20:44.661 --> 20:46.079
What?
Speak up!

20:46.079 --> 20:47.623
Oh! Nothing, nothing!

20:47.623 --> 20:49.917
Stay! The party's just getting started!

20:51.710 --> 20:55.547
This song is awesome!
Please, come on!

21:23.617 --> 21:26.745
Sorry I keep sniffling. My jaw hurts and
I've never felt so alive! Guys listen,

21:26.745 --> 21:30.082
come visit me in my office any time.
Whatever you need. I mean it.

21:30.082 --> 21:32.251
That's the rule of the Road Dogs.
Because we're the Road Dogs!

21:32.543 --> 21:34.169
What are we? What are we?

21:34.169 --> 21:35.504
The Road Dogs, of course!

21:35.504 --> 21:39.383
Hey, do you like movies? What if we
start a movie club? Road Dog Movie Club!

21:39.383 --> 21:40.759
Don't say no, don't say no.

21:40.759 --> 21:45.889
We have to watch Ordinary People,
that movie is so so sad, guys.

21:49.309 --> 21:51.186
Hey, DP.

21:51.186 --> 21:53.897
Just wanted to say thanks
for the lesson last night.

21:53.897 --> 21:55.148
My pleasure.

21:55.148 --> 21:58.443
And you know what? You're right.
I have been letting other people lead me.

21:59.069 --> 22:00.779
But you really showed me
how to be a leader.

22:00.779 --> 22:03.240
I'm glad you learned that life lesson.

22:03.824 --> 22:06.243
Life? I was just talking about dancing.

22:09.955 --> 22:11.874
Oh, my God, that is a life lesson.

22:11.874 --> 22:14.543
Like, here at work, my--

22:15.419 --> 22:18.297
"The resort" likes things a certain way,

22:18.297 --> 22:22.676
but maybe I need to push back more
against what "the resort" wants.

22:22.676 --> 22:24.928
Oh, yeah. "The resort."

22:26.180 --> 22:29.349
I've tried to take more time off
to visit my son,

22:29.892 --> 22:33.270
but "the resort" won't allow it.

22:33.270 --> 22:36.190
Well, your son's missing out.
I hope you get to see him soon.

22:36.190 --> 22:38.317
Thank you, Chad. I hope so too.

22:41.862 --> 22:43.614
"The resort" is my mom--
-I know, Chad.

22:44.489 --> 22:45.532
You get me.

22:51.455 --> 22:56.502
Máximo, I'm so tired. I can't believe
I didn't even get to go home last night.

22:56.502 --> 22:59.588
Well, the good news is
Hugo Sánchez has to be there tonight.

22:59.588 --> 23:03.091
Boys' night out.
-Are you still being my me?

23:03.091 --> 23:04.301
If so,

23:05.219 --> 23:07.221
I can be a real pain in the ass.

23:08.138 --> 23:09.014
Hey!

23:09.932 --> 23:12.226
You are never going to believe who
came to La Marea last night.

23:12.976 --> 23:14.520
Hugo Sánchez!

23:15.395 --> 23:16.688
After I left you at the club,

23:16.939 --> 23:18.524
I stopped there to have
dinner and he was there.

23:19.274 --> 23:20.192
Are you kidding me?!

23:21.985 --> 23:27.241
So, if we just left last night
like I wanted to,

23:27.824 --> 23:29.785
I could have met Hugo Sánchez?!

23:31.537 --> 23:32.371
How was he? Was he nice?

23:32.371 --> 23:33.288
Yes, but...

23:33.288 --> 23:34.456
How could you do this?!

23:34.456 --> 23:35.749
I was just trying to cheer you up.

23:35.916 --> 23:37.125
You were sad about Lorena...

23:37.125 --> 23:38.919
Well now I'm not sad Máximo,

23:39.211 --> 23:40.504
now I'm angry!

23:40.712 --> 23:42.506
Because I didn't get to meet
Hugo Sánchez,

23:42.631 --> 23:43.799
I missed talking with Lorena!

23:44.091 --> 23:46.927
And we had to dance
with the ridiculous Héctor.

23:47.553 --> 23:49.388
Why didn't you just let us go home?!

23:51.056 --> 23:52.474
Because I can't go home!

23:53.559 --> 23:55.227
It doesn't even feel like home.

23:56.061 --> 23:57.563
Sara and my mom got into a huge fight.

23:57.563 --> 23:58.480
Sara moved out...

23:58.897 --> 24:01.692
My family is falling apart,
and I can't fix it.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.591
Ever since my dad passed away,
I've felt,

24:26.341 --> 24:29.845
"Okay, Máximo, now it's your
job to keep this family safe."

24:31.513 --> 24:32.973
Sexist.

24:33.557 --> 24:34.600
But sweet.

24:35.893 --> 24:38.312
I don't want to go home because it
reminds me that I failed.

24:38.979 --> 24:41.190
No Máximo, how did you fail?

24:42.191 --> 24:45.027
Your mom and your sister love each
other way too much for this to be the end.

24:45.444 --> 24:50.657
It's true. Sometimes things have to
break apart to come back stronger.

24:50.657 --> 24:53.327
You just have to
keep being there for them.

24:54.995 --> 24:56.955
You guys are gonna get out of this one.

24:57.456 --> 24:59.917
After all, you can do anything.

25:00.626 --> 25:04.254
You are Máximo and Sara and Nora Gallardo.

25:06.048 --> 25:07.591
Are you being my Memo again?

25:07.591 --> 25:09.968
It's the natural order of things.

25:10.469 --> 25:12.804
Although,
she's a really good Memo-in-training.

25:14.181 --> 25:15.182
Thanks.

25:16.642 --> 25:19.770
I'm sorry we never saw Hugo Sánchez.
-It's okay.

25:20.896 --> 25:25.567
For the record, he was really nice.
In fact...

25:28.862 --> 25:30.948
I have Hugo Sánchez's signature?

25:31.573 --> 25:34.159
I'm sorry.
I should have gotten a clean napkin.

25:34.159 --> 25:36.411
On a napkin that he used?

25:37.996 --> 25:39.748
I kissed Hugo Sánchez.

25:39.748 --> 25:41.542
And he tastes like mole?

25:42.292 --> 25:43.293
Posole.

25:48.340 --> 25:49.466
Hey Julia!

25:49.633 --> 25:51.134
Hey, Sara. What's up?

25:51.260 --> 25:54.346
So, is there any way I can stay
for just a few more days...

25:54.721 --> 25:55.556
or weeks...

25:55.556 --> 25:56.682
more in the hotel?

25:56.807 --> 26:00.227
It doesn't have to be a suite.
Although a king-size bed would be nice.

26:00.811 --> 26:03.689
I'm so sorry, I told you, those
rooms all start renovations today.

26:04.106 --> 26:04.940
Are you sure?

26:05.399 --> 26:09.278
I can sleep anywhere. And I'm pretty
small so even a cupboard can do!

26:10.070 --> 26:10.904
Look...

26:11.196 --> 26:13.657
I'm happy to let you use
the front desk phone,

26:13.866 --> 26:16.702
if you want to call a
friend or family member.

26:18.787 --> 26:21.081
Obviously you don't have to
tell me what happened, but--

26:21.206 --> 26:22.499
if you need anything I'm here.

26:23.542 --> 26:24.418
I'm a lesbian.

26:30.090 --> 26:31.133
Wow.

26:32.134 --> 26:33.760
That's the first time
I've ever said that.

26:36.346 --> 26:37.973
But my mom found out,

26:37.973 --> 26:40.684
and she thinks I'm going to Hell...
-No, no, no.

26:40.684 --> 26:42.603
...and I can't go back but I don't know
what else to do,

26:42.603 --> 26:45.189
because I'm afraid of telling other
people, so where am I going to live--

26:45.189 --> 26:46.231
Sara. Sara.

26:47.024 --> 26:48.358
You can stay with me.

26:51.695 --> 26:52.905
What?
-Yes.

26:53.155 --> 26:57.451
You can stay at my apartment.
As long as you need. I mean it.

26:59.036 --> 26:59.912
Are you sure?

27:02.372 --> 27:05.876
My mom taught me that women should
always support each other.

27:06.418 --> 27:08.212
And you shouldn't have to
go through this alone.

27:09.004 --> 27:10.214
I'm here for you.

27:12.049 --> 27:13.008
Oh my God... Thank you!

27:14.218 --> 27:15.844
Everything will be fine, I promise.

27:17.930 --> 27:19.223
<i>Wow.</i>

27:19.932 --> 27:22.559
And I thought you were just having a blast
at the resort.

27:23.477 --> 27:28.273
Well, even if you didn't know
everything that was going on...

27:32.194 --> 27:35.072
<i>you still did what Memo told you to do.</i>

27:43.497 --> 27:45.499
<i>You kept being there for the both of us.</i>

27:50.170 --> 27:52.631
Now, I gotta go scream at a DA.

27:52.631 --> 27:53.966
I love you, <i>chaparrito</i>.

27:53.966 --> 27:56.218
I love you too, Mom.
-Bye, Sarape.

27:56.969 --> 27:58.053
<i>Bye</i>.

28:07.813 --> 28:09.022
Okay, let's go.

28:10.357 --> 28:12.985
It all goes back to what Isabel told me.

28:13.527 --> 28:17.197
Sometimes things have to break apart
to come back stronger.

28:17.197 --> 28:20.701
Just because something is bad now,
it doesn't mean it can't get better.

28:21.368 --> 28:24.580
Just like... Are you ready for the metaphor?

28:25.998 --> 28:28.417
Just like this marina.

28:31.086 --> 28:34.715
You see, this whole area
used to look like where we started.

28:35.757 --> 28:39.094
After I found success,
I wanted to give back a little.

28:40.262 --> 28:41.388
Wow.

28:41.972 --> 28:43.223
You did this?

28:43.223 --> 28:44.516
Yeah.

28:44.516 --> 28:46.977
It's the first thing I did
once I got rich.

28:46.977 --> 28:48.729
I'll tell you more about it on the boat.

28:49.897 --> 28:52.107
That's-- That's pretty cool.
-Yep.

28:52.649 --> 28:56.737
So, is the next part of the story
how Mom came back home?

28:56.737 --> 28:57.863
I wish.

28:58.488 --> 28:59.573
I didn't know it yet,

28:59.573 --> 29:03.243
<i>but a more urgent problem
was about to change everything for me.</i>

29:06.455 --> 29:11.668
Máximo Gallardo. It's so good
to see you again, my handsome friend.

29:11.668 --> 29:14.004
Join me here in my office
for a moment.

29:14.338 --> 29:17.299
I have some information you
won't want to miss.
