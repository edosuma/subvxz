00:17.606 --> 00:20.326
Excuse me, do you know
if a Mr. Garland works here?

00:20.366 --> 00:22.486
Yes, sir. He's the manager.

00:36.126 --> 00:37.606
Toby.

00:44.668 --> 00:47.948
I haven't... I haven't been able
to copy out all the data.

00:47.988 --> 00:51.268
- It's not easy keeping it in my head.
- No, I understand.

00:51.308 --> 00:54.028
But I will need it completed
by tomorrow.

00:54.068 --> 00:56.308
And that's not a request.

01:10.668 --> 01:13.508
- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for work.

01:16.228 --> 01:19.868
I'm sorry. That's not possible.

01:19.908 --> 01:23.188
Right, you think I'm not
good enough for a place like this?

01:23.228 --> 01:25.308
It isn't about that.

01:30.028 --> 01:33.108
It's about us, about what happened.
You know that.

01:34.188 --> 01:36.748
Sam, please. I've got nothing.

01:38.468 --> 01:40.788
You shouldn't have come here.

02:21.468 --> 02:24.188
I think you and I may have
something to talk about.

03:25.428 --> 03:28.708
If you fall, make sure
you land on your head.

03:41.028 --> 03:44.068
The preparations for this evening
are nearly complete.

03:44.108 --> 03:46.045
Hopefully you'll be pleasantly
surprised.

03:46.085 --> 03:47.827
What about my speech?

03:47.868 --> 03:50.988
- Your speech?
- Well, I am the owner of the hotel.

03:51.028 --> 03:54.068
I assume I'll be making
some sort of address.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.623
Yes, of course.

03:55.647 --> 03:57.444
Why not ask the American to write it?

03:57.508 --> 04:00.868
Apparently, he's rather popular
on the wireless.

04:08.548 --> 04:10.668
Sorry, it's...

04:11.828 --> 04:15.988
It's work. But I thought they'd
cleared you of any wrongdoing.

04:16.028 --> 04:19.668
They've allowed me to continue, but
they're watching me very closely.

04:19.708 --> 04:22.348
Will you smile, please?

04:22.388 --> 04:25.388
You have a lovely smile
and I never see it any more.

04:27.068 --> 04:29.348
Toby.

04:31.668 --> 04:34.360
Is it Mr. D'Abberville
that's bothering you?

04:34.416 --> 04:35.416
Yes.

04:36.548 --> 04:38.948
Yes, it is.

04:38.988 --> 04:41.468
Look, what do you really know
about him?

04:41.508 --> 04:43.103
Why is he here? What does he do?

04:43.142 --> 04:46.587
Listen, Mr. D'Abberville is not going
to try and replace your father.

04:46.708 --> 04:50.308
No, no, no, I don't mean that.
Lucian!

04:50.348 --> 04:54.544
Will you please reassure my son?
He has his doubts about you.

04:54.569 --> 04:55.569
No!

04:55.668 --> 05:00.428
Well, that's all right. Sometimes
I have doubts about me.

05:00.468 --> 05:06.308
Well, Toby, what about you and I
have drink and a chat later on?

05:06.348 --> 05:10.348
About four o'clock? I'm sure we can
find one or two things to talk about.

05:16.308 --> 05:18.428
Looking good.

05:18.468 --> 05:21.708
Mr. Klein, a word.

05:30.308 --> 05:34.908
Despite difficult personal
circumstances and a rocky start,

05:34.948 --> 05:37.388
you've excelled.

05:37.428 --> 05:40.348
Which is why I'm giving you
the rest of the week off.

05:40.388 --> 05:42.628
I'm happy to keep working, sir.

05:42.668 --> 05:45.988
I thought you might want to spend
some time with your family.

05:46.988 --> 05:51.308
We've managed to track them down to
an internment camp outside Liverpool.

05:51.348 --> 05:53.428
They're on the train to London now.

06:00.748 --> 06:04.268
When are they arriving here?

06:04.308 --> 06:06.068
This evening.

06:07.268 --> 06:12.908
Mr. Garland... one day
I will repay you for this.

06:12.948 --> 06:15.308
That's not necessary.

06:15.348 --> 06:18.308
- I'm just glad we could help.
- Thank you.

06:29.388 --> 06:32.228
Going soft, you are.

06:32.268 --> 06:34.908
You never would've given him
time off before.

06:34.948 --> 06:39.188
Maybe I'm just getting caught up
in the anniversary celebrations.

06:40.468 --> 06:45.428
- Are you coming this evening?
- I didn't know staff were invited.

06:45.468 --> 06:48.868
Apparently, I'm not as strict
as I used to be.

06:52.468 --> 06:53.508
You...

06:55.588 --> 06:58.548
You could be my guest.

07:03.308 --> 07:07.108
Well, I'd like that. Thank you.

07:19.668 --> 07:21.828
Toby. Toby.

07:21.868 --> 07:23.988
He's making you work for him,
isn't he?

07:24.028 --> 07:26.108
Toby, you need to find a way out.

07:26.148 --> 07:29.012
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be
in this bloody situation!

07:29.176 --> 07:30.246
I know.

07:30.348 --> 07:34.548
Look, I can't change what happened,
but you can't let him do this to you.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.668
- And who's gonna help me? You?
- You can't do this alone.

07:47.268 --> 07:53.268
Anything you tell me... will be
in the strictest of confidence.

07:55.868 --> 08:00.068
I am being...
I am being blackmailed...

08:01.228 --> 08:03.028
by...

08:04.508 --> 08:07.015
erm, by Mr. D'Abberville.

08:10.388 --> 08:14.508
What does he want? Money?

08:14.548 --> 08:20.388
He wants certain classified...
documents.

08:20.428 --> 08:23.028
Information.

08:23.068 --> 08:25.828
He's working with the Germans?

08:27.108 --> 08:31.788
Toby, we must inform the authorities.

08:31.828 --> 08:34.347
It's... not that simple.

08:34.746 --> 08:37.996
He found out about certain aspects
of my private life...

08:38.868 --> 08:41.707
and who I choose
to spend them with.

08:44.828 --> 08:48.130
- Does he have evidence?
- I'm not sure, but he knows.

08:48.155 --> 08:50.108
Well, knowing isn't everything.

08:51.548 --> 08:55.628
So this is why there were leaks coming
from your Admiralty department.

08:56.828 --> 08:59.428
Then the authorities
are out of the question.

09:00.175 --> 09:04.073
You're already implicated and
the word treason does lead us down

09:04.098 --> 09:07.908
- a particularly ugly road.
- I don't know what to do.

09:10.868 --> 09:16.948
Blackmail... relies on the recipient
being too scared to act against it.

09:16.988 --> 09:19.068
But you came to me.

09:20.108 --> 09:22.628
I will deal with our Mr. D'Abberville.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.988
No, there.

09:30.988 --> 09:32.908
Thank you.

09:34.388 --> 09:37.068
Hello, Mr. Garland.

09:37.108 --> 09:39.308
Mr. D'Abberville.

09:39.348 --> 09:42.668
I was just thinking,
you've been here five months,

09:42.708 --> 09:44.988
it seems we've barely spoken.

09:45.028 --> 09:47.908
Well, I always thought
you rather disapproved of me.

09:47.948 --> 09:53.028
Disapprove
is far too gentle a word.

09:53.068 --> 09:55.948
I know about the blackmail.

09:55.988 --> 09:58.556
I know about Toby Hamilton.

09:58.665 --> 10:02.986
And if you think you can act this way
without consequence in my hotel...

10:03.010 --> 10:04.463
You're not going to do a thing.

10:04.517 --> 10:09.605
- On that you are very much mistaken.
- I know who you are...

10:10.908 --> 10:14.148
Sergeant Green.
And I know what you did.

10:15.828 --> 10:18.948
In the forest at Villers Cotterets.

10:19.988 --> 10:22.788
Whatever information...

10:22.828 --> 10:25.868
- you may think you have...
- No, the game is over.

10:27.188 --> 10:28.868
Sam.

10:28.908 --> 10:31.028
The pieces are already
off the board.

10:31.068 --> 10:36.548
Now, if you insist on continuing, then you
give me no choice but to... expose you.

10:36.588 --> 10:38.450
You seem to be forgetting Toby.

10:38.475 --> 10:40.771
I think we both know Toby's
not gonna go to the police.

10:41.384 --> 10:42.233
Lady Hamilton...

10:42.258 --> 10:46.828
Lady Hamilton already believes her son has
got an unreasonable vendetta against me.

10:46.868 --> 10:51.188
And as for you, well, we all know what
Her Ladyship thinks about Mr. Garland.

10:51.228 --> 10:55.108
Whatever move you make... you lose.

10:56.948 --> 11:01.388
So, swallow your pride, do nothing

11:01.428 --> 11:03.708
and stay out of my way.

11:03.748 --> 11:05.868
It's only for another day.

11:09.428 --> 11:11.828
You've built yourself
a nice life here.

11:12.908 --> 11:15.068
And for your daughter.

11:16.468 --> 11:18.668
Don't let it go to waste.

11:37.543 --> 11:39.394
So, what happened?

11:39.418 --> 11:41.538
- I'm working on it.
- But you spoke to him?

11:41.578 --> 11:43.898
It isn't a simple situation, Toby.

11:44.978 --> 11:47.058
What happened?

11:47.098 --> 11:50.578
Mr. D'Abberville finds himself
in a position of strength.

11:50.618 --> 11:53.138
The wrong move could ruin
a lot of lives.

11:53.178 --> 11:55.778
So you're just...
you're going to do nothing?

11:55.818 --> 11:57.858
No.

11:57.898 --> 11:59.578
No.

11:59.618 --> 12:02.178
There is still one more option.

12:06.007 --> 12:07.583
Wait. When did you kiss him?

12:07.608 --> 12:10.578
Can you say it a bit louder?
Some of the staff didn't hear.

12:12.618 --> 12:16.778
- The other day after dinner.
- That's good. Is it good?

12:16.818 --> 12:19.818
It is. Sort of.

12:19.858 --> 12:22.738
But it's Joe O'Hara, so...

12:23.738 --> 12:25.991
It's almost as though he's deliberately
holding back.

12:26.016 --> 12:28.202
This has nothing to do with Freddie?

12:28.233 --> 12:30.378
No.

12:30.418 --> 12:33.316
Well, I don't know, maybe.

12:34.178 --> 12:38.627
Hotel's on fire, you can only save
one of them. Who do you choose?

12:38.652 --> 12:41.218
I can't answer that.

12:41.258 --> 12:43.778
You spent a long time
loving Freddie.

12:43.818 --> 12:46.058
That won't just disappear.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.938
I've also seen the way
you look at Joe.

12:48.978 --> 12:51.098
And if he's serious, he'll show it.

12:52.378 --> 12:55.378
That's how it is with you and Sonny?
He's told you he loves you?

12:55.418 --> 12:58.298
He said he felt it
since the day we met.

12:58.338 --> 13:00.418
And you've told him, too?

13:00.458 --> 13:02.538
This isn't about me, Garland.

13:05.258 --> 13:08.818
Hell, there's a war on.
Choose them both!

13:14.618 --> 13:18.138
I need to speak to you
about Mr. D'Abberville.

13:19.578 --> 13:23.978
I believe he has not been entirely
honest about his reasons for being here.

13:25.658 --> 13:29.138
What reasons are these?
His continued presence in the hotel

13:29.178 --> 13:33.218
is purely to obtain official secrets

13:33.258 --> 13:36.858
and sell them on to the Germans.

13:36.898 --> 13:39.538
Is that really the best
you could come up with?

13:39.578 --> 13:42.418
Why do you think Toby
is so suspicious of him?

13:42.474 --> 13:46.754
Toby thinks Mr. D'Abberville
is trying to replace his father.

13:46.778 --> 13:48.434
With all due respect,

13:48.459 --> 13:51.270
does that really sound like something
that would trouble Toby?

13:51.578 --> 13:55.418
Why do you think Special Branch
targeted the hotel?

13:55.458 --> 13:58.978
- Mr. D'Abberville has helped us.
- Mr. D'Abberville is leaving.

14:00.738 --> 14:03.338
Possibly today.

14:03.378 --> 14:05.338
If not, tomorrow.

14:09.938 --> 14:12.338
And do you have any evidence

14:12.378 --> 14:14.658
to back up these ludicrous claims?

14:14.698 --> 14:18.138
Your Ladyship,
no matter what you may think of me,

14:18.350 --> 14:20.910
you know I would not stand here
and lie to you.

14:20.935 --> 14:23.178
You've been lying to me for years!

14:23.218 --> 14:26.338
Covering up for my husband.
Offering me tea in the atrium

14:26.378 --> 14:29.378
while he was up here
carrying on with his mistresses.

14:30.458 --> 14:32.978
You forget your place, Mr. Garland.

14:34.218 --> 14:36.378
You're not welcome here.

14:43.458 --> 14:47.981
- Demanded Brazil nuts.
- It's true.

15:01.175 --> 15:02.853
What are you doing, Mr. O'Hara?

15:02.878 --> 15:05.486
I am composing a speech
for your mother.

15:05.511 --> 15:07.578
Feel free to throw in
your two cents.

15:07.618 --> 15:10.516
No, I didn't mean about the writing,
I meant about her.

15:10.540 --> 15:11.524
Her being...

15:11.538 --> 15:13.538
Emma.

15:13.578 --> 15:17.178
- We're having that conversation?
- Yes, we are.

15:19.498 --> 15:22.618
Well, then, in the politest way
possible, Your Lordship,

15:22.658 --> 15:26.338
- it's none of your goddamn business.
- And what if I disagree with that?

15:27.938 --> 15:32.658
Fine. I'll make it simple.
Are you in love with her?

15:32.698 --> 15:35.830
I refer the honourable gentleman
to my previous answer.

15:35.855 --> 15:37.354
If you say you are, I'll walk away.

15:45.058 --> 15:47.178
You broke her heart once before.

15:47.218 --> 15:50.498
Do you really think
she wants to go through that again?

15:50.538 --> 15:54.298
- You've not answered the question.
- That's because I'm not staff.

15:54.338 --> 15:58.058
You say jump
and my feet stay on the ground.

15:58.098 --> 16:01.504
Or maybe you don't want to answer it
because you don't want to admit the truth.

16:02.338 --> 16:05.938
You step down, kid. That you love
her but you know that's not enough.

16:05.963 --> 16:07.830
I said step down!

16:07.855 --> 16:10.524
Because you know she'll never
feel the same about you.

16:12.178 --> 16:15.646
- Goddammit!
- What on earth are you doing?

16:15.670 --> 16:16.943
I kind of owed him that.

16:16.978 --> 16:19.157
I think Mr. O'Hara objects
to me being near you.

16:19.182 --> 16:21.181
For goodness' sakes,
both of you!

16:21.418 --> 16:23.178
I'm at work.

16:24.498 --> 16:27.138
Mr. O'Hara, you need to leave.

16:35.058 --> 16:37.538
I guess I was all wrapped up here,
anyway.

16:42.578 --> 16:47.058
I'm telling you this as a manager after
you struck the owner of this place.

16:47.098 --> 16:49.178
That's all.

16:50.178 --> 16:52.538
This isn't personal, Joe.

16:53.538 --> 16:55.458
Emma...

16:57.578 --> 16:59.578
Never mind.

17:00.658 --> 17:02.738
Enjoy your party.

17:11.178 --> 17:13.578
I've been thinking.

17:13.617 --> 17:16.657
And... I could go to the police.

17:16.698 --> 17:18.897
And what will you tell them?

17:19.615 --> 17:22.578
- That you stole from me?
- Yes. Exactly that.

17:22.617 --> 17:26.578
- They don't need to know about you and me.
- Do you realise what will happen to you?

17:26.617 --> 17:30.664
I have to make things right,
no matter what the cost.

17:30.689 --> 17:32.289
Do you really think they'll believe you?

17:33.458 --> 17:34.731
A cocktail waiter?

17:36.349 --> 17:37.776
Mr. D'Abberville will deny it

17:37.801 --> 17:40.232
and you'll be laughed out of the station,
a deranged fantasist.

17:40.256 --> 17:41.474
- Toby.
- It's Mr. Hamilton.

17:41.858 --> 17:44.138
And I know what you're doing.

17:44.178 --> 17:47.898
You think that if you do this,
that I will somehow forgive you.

17:47.938 --> 17:51.658
- I'm not doing this to change your mind.
- Good. Cos it wouldn't work.

17:52.898 --> 17:57.738
When I think about what we did,
I'm disgusted at myself.

17:57.778 --> 18:01.138
- Toby, I love you.
- How dare you say that?

18:02.178 --> 18:05.418
You want to do me a favour?
You want to help? Get out.

18:06.658 --> 18:08.458
Disappear.

18:08.498 --> 18:11.338
There is no place for you here
and there never will be.

18:20.618 --> 18:22.658
As you wish...

18:23.738 --> 18:25.538
Mr. Hamilton.

18:48.018 --> 18:51.778
I want to leave a surprise
for Mr. D'Abberville.

18:52.898 --> 18:55.018
Very good, Your Ladyship.

18:59.818 --> 19:01.538
Thank you.

19:41.258 --> 19:44.098
- Mr. D'Abberville.
- Thank you for being here, Toby.

19:44.138 --> 19:47.058
I do realise
this is a very tricky situation.

19:47.098 --> 19:49.978
But at least it's...
coming to an end.

19:51.498 --> 19:53.658
I'm not going to help you.

19:58.418 --> 20:01.418
Do you really want the world
to know the truth about you?

20:02.418 --> 20:05.458
Think of what it'll do to your
family and, well, your life.

20:05.498 --> 20:09.458
Thousands of people risk their lives
every day for this country,

20:09.498 --> 20:12.218
my brother amongst them.

20:12.258 --> 20:14.578
My future is nothing
compared to that.

20:14.618 --> 20:17.203
That's very moving.
I'm sure Special Branch

20:17.227 --> 20:19.297
will be equally touched when
they hear about it.

20:19.338 --> 20:21.618
Well, I suppose we'll find out.

20:23.018 --> 20:25.138
I've already telephoned them.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.378
You stupid child.

20:35.178 --> 20:37.178
You stupid child!

21:04.138 --> 21:05.738
Priscilla.

21:09.658 --> 21:11.658
An explanation.

21:13.898 --> 21:16.578
For the tickets, the passports.

21:16.618 --> 21:18.818
It's a complicated situation.

21:19.898 --> 21:22.498
- I didn't want to worry you.
- Worry me?

21:23.698 --> 21:26.778
It's just a bit of business
I've been doing.

21:27.778 --> 21:31.938
The ticket is provisional, in case I
have to attend to it at short notice.

21:31.978 --> 21:34.618
And the passports,
I mean, that's prudence.

21:36.258 --> 21:38.618
Bearing in mind
the times we're living in.

21:38.658 --> 21:43.858
They say the truth and lies
sound different.

21:45.298 --> 21:49.658
- But they don't, do they?
- Priscilla... you're being emotional.

21:49.698 --> 21:51.298
No.

21:53.018 --> 21:55.458
- Not yet.
- Darling, let's just put them away.

21:55.498 --> 21:58.658
Is it true about the... documents?

22:00.018 --> 22:01.978
The Germans?

22:03.058 --> 22:04.578
What?

22:05.618 --> 22:09.298
Look, I don't know what Toby's
been saying to you, but he...

22:10.298 --> 22:12.498
he has his own problems.

22:13.858 --> 22:15.978
It wasn't Toby.

22:17.778 --> 22:19.898
It was Garland.

22:22.258 --> 22:25.298
Well, Mr. Garland isn't quite
what he claims to be.

22:27.378 --> 22:30.658
Come on, just give me what is mine
and we'll talk.

22:30.698 --> 22:34.098
Was any of it true?
Any of it at all?

22:39.698 --> 22:41.578
Answer me!

22:44.818 --> 22:48.258
Look, I didn't intend...
for things to move so fast.

22:50.618 --> 22:55.578
But you were so starved of attention
and affection, it...

22:57.658 --> 22:59.858
I loved you in my own way.

23:02.178 --> 23:04.218
No. No!

23:05.746 --> 23:07.517
That was my way out!

23:07.542 --> 23:10.218
This isn't something I'm gonna
let you walk away from.

23:10.258 --> 23:13.858
No, you... You put the phone down,
Priscilla. Put the phone down!

23:13.898 --> 23:17.298
- Take your hands off me!
- You are gonna be quiet!

23:17.338 --> 23:20.098
And you are going to listen to me.

23:21.098 --> 23:24.658
Now, I am walking out of here
and you will not do a thing.

23:24.698 --> 23:26.573
And do you know why?
Because of Toby!

23:26.598 --> 23:27.598
Agh!

23:28.178 --> 23:33.058
Even if you continue to wilfully
ignore the sordid details

23:33.098 --> 23:36.378
of your son's wretched
private life...

23:36.418 --> 23:38.578
he's still a traitor.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.938
And you know the penalty
for treason.

23:40.978 --> 23:44.618
And if I go down, Priscilla,
that boy is going with me!

23:44.658 --> 23:47.087
We will hang together
by our bloody necks!

23:47.112 --> 23:48.112
No! No!

25:07.898 --> 25:10.618
He was very... angry.

25:13.098 --> 25:15.218
He...

25:16.218 --> 25:18.338
he threatened my children.

25:18.378 --> 25:21.018
We must keep the door locked.

25:21.058 --> 25:24.018
Tell housekeeping it's off-limits.

25:25.138 --> 25:28.538
Far too busy downstairs
to attempt to move the body now.

25:30.344 --> 25:31.188
Were you hurt?

25:31.234 --> 25:35.218
I didn't mean
to do it. I'm sorry. Please help me.

25:35.258 --> 25:37.738
- I'm sorry. Please.
- I know.

25:42.018 --> 25:44.218
Does anyone else know you're here?

25:45.658 --> 25:48.738
Er, from housekeeping,
the Irish girl. I can't...

25:48.778 --> 25:52.018
- I can't remember her name, but...
- She won't be a problem.

25:53.138 --> 25:55.298
But you can't remain here.

25:56.418 --> 26:00.898
You must return to your room
and prepare yourself for the party.

26:00.938 --> 26:04.738
- No, I can't possibly go to the party!
- Your presence is expected!

26:06.338 --> 26:09.098
You must not raise any suspicions.

26:11.138 --> 26:13.418
You may feel nauseous.

26:14.418 --> 26:17.778
Short of breath. That will pass.

26:17.818 --> 26:19.858
The main thing is...

26:21.498 --> 26:25.538
- to act as if everything is normal.
- Everything is very far from normal.

26:26.538 --> 26:30.018
Leave this with me, Your Ladyship.

26:35.618 --> 26:37.698
Mr. Garland.

26:39.138 --> 26:41.298
He said that...

26:42.338 --> 26:44.498
you're not who you claim to be.

26:46.658 --> 26:49.498
I expect Mr. D'Abberville
said a lot of things

26:49.538 --> 26:51.618
that have no merit.

26:51.658 --> 26:54.258
Please. You need to go.

26:57.778 --> 26:59.938
Why are you helping me?

27:00.978 --> 27:02.818
Because you asked.

27:06.938 --> 27:08.938
Thank you.

27:28.138 --> 27:29.938
You ready?

27:31.298 --> 27:33.458
Yes, Mr. Robbie.

27:34.778 --> 27:36.578
I'm ready.

27:46.258 --> 27:47.978
Papa!

28:08.098 --> 28:11.018
I've been thinking about
the past few months.

28:11.058 --> 28:14.698
I know I can be difficult, trouble.

28:14.738 --> 28:18.818
If you've... If you've got regrets
or want to run for the hills,

28:18.858 --> 28:21.018
I'll understand.

28:21.058 --> 28:25.578
There's only one place I'm going to
be and that's right by your side.

28:26.778 --> 28:28.978
Good. Cos I...

28:30.578 --> 28:32.938
I love you.

28:36.938 --> 28:39.018
Can you say that again, please?

28:39.058 --> 28:43.378
You heard me perfectly fine,
Mr. Sullivan.

28:55.098 --> 29:00.618
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight sees 50
glorious years of the Halcyon Hotel,

29:00.658 --> 29:02.738
but, but, but...

29:02.778 --> 29:06.178
we all know a party isn't a party

29:06.218 --> 29:09.458
without Miss Betsey Day!

29:11.018 --> 29:13.578
I'll send it back up. Yes, sir.

29:33.218 --> 29:36.818
What exactly did you say to
Mr. O'Hara that made him punch you?

29:38.418 --> 29:42.938
I'm not so sure if it's what I said
or... what was unsaid.

29:44.938 --> 29:47.698
And that would be?

29:47.738 --> 29:50.018
That I made a mistake...

29:50.058 --> 29:52.138
in letting you go.

29:52.178 --> 29:54.258
That I love you.

29:55.378 --> 29:57.538
And I want you back.

30:03.418 --> 30:06.218
And what if it's too late
for that now?

30:07.458 --> 30:09.618
I'm fairly sure it's too late,
but...

30:11.778 --> 30:14.778
I couldn't live with myself
if I didn't at least try.

30:22.938 --> 30:24.938
After you.

30:48.338 --> 30:51.418
- Hello?
- "Mr. D'Abberville?"

30:51.458 --> 30:53.578
No, it's Mr. Garland.

30:53.907 --> 30:55.405
"Special Branch have arrived.

30:55.430 --> 30:58.578
Apparently they're very keen
to speak to Mr. D'Abberville."

30:59.858 --> 31:01.938
He's not here, I'm afraid.

31:01.978 --> 31:05.338
They were most insistent,
said they'd received a tip-off.

31:05.378 --> 31:08.538
They're already on their way
up to his room.

31:08.578 --> 31:10.658
Thank you, Wilfred.

31:27.738 --> 31:30.498
Gentlemen. How can I help?

31:30.538 --> 31:33.538
- We're looking for Mr. D'Abberville.
- As am I.

31:33.578 --> 31:36.378
He's run up quite the bill
and seems to have vanished.

31:36.418 --> 31:40.098
Would you mind if we check his room,
just to see with our own eyes?

31:40.138 --> 31:42.938
I'm afraid that's against
hotel policy.

31:42.978 --> 31:47.138
The privacy of our guests
is of the utmost importance.

31:47.178 --> 31:50.108
I wasn't really asking, Mr. Garland.

32:02.898 --> 32:04.898
Yes.

32:06.178 --> 32:08.978
I did find... this.

32:11.938 --> 32:15.058
7:30 Euston to Liverpool Lime Street.

32:15.098 --> 32:18.575
We'll have someone waiting for him
at the other end, just in case.

32:18.623 --> 32:19.193
Sir.

32:19.218 --> 32:22.698
Anything else I can do to help,
please don't hesitate to ask.

32:24.178 --> 32:27.138
You're not a bad liar, Mr. Garland.

32:27.178 --> 32:29.778
But I'm fairly certain

32:29.818 --> 32:32.538
you are hiding something.

32:44.298 --> 32:47.018
Lady Hamilton was...

32:48.978 --> 32:52.058
romantically involved
with Mr. D'Abberville.

32:52.098 --> 32:58.018
We believe he was intent on taking
a substantial sum of money from her.

32:58.058 --> 33:00.138
It is, as you can imagine...

33:01.138 --> 33:03.138
a very embarrassing situation.

33:04.098 --> 33:08.018
And her husband
barely cold in the grave.

33:11.258 --> 33:13.898
We'll be in touch, Mr. Garland.

34:22.138 --> 34:25.538
Tom, have the police been to the
hotel at all? Not that I know of.

34:25.578 --> 34:27.418
Mr. Hamilton.

34:27.458 --> 34:31.178
Sorry. I've got a letter here
for you. It's from Mr. Joshi.

34:45.898 --> 34:48.737
- Tom, when did he give this to you?
- A few hours ago.

35:58.058 --> 36:00.098
Well done.

36:04.652 --> 36:05.433
Peggy!

36:05.456 --> 36:09.018
Richard. You remember
my husband, Jim.

36:10.745 --> 36:12.339
Yes, of course.

36:13.098 --> 36:16.338
- Jim got given leave last minute.
- Just in time for the party.

36:17.338 --> 36:20.138
Glad to get out of the house.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.738
Well, I hope you both
have a wonderful evening.

36:43.178 --> 36:45.898
Five minutes then we move the party
to the shelter.

36:45.925 --> 36:47.697
I'll head upstairs and start
gathering guests.

36:47.721 --> 36:50.458
Too much to expect one night off.

36:50.498 --> 36:52.578
You know that sound.

36:52.618 --> 36:55.418
We've gotta move out.

36:55.458 --> 36:58.258
But just time for one last song.

36:58.298 --> 37:00.578
One, two, three, four.

37:02.818 --> 37:04.938
For a lady...

37:04.978 --> 37:08.058
who turns 50 years old today.

37:08.098 --> 37:11.898
The Halcyon Hotel!

37:11.938 --> 37:16.058
The stories these walls could tell.

37:16.098 --> 37:18.258
The people who fell in love.

37:19.258 --> 37:22.018
The people who fell out.

37:22.058 --> 37:24.738
The joy.

37:24.778 --> 37:27.218
The heartbreak.

37:27.258 --> 37:30.498
The good times and the bad.

37:31.818 --> 37:34.178
I thought I told you to leave.

37:34.218 --> 37:37.378
So raise your glasses
and give a cheer

37:37.418 --> 37:40.098
to 50 golden years!

37:52.218 --> 37:54.178
Emma.

37:55.178 --> 37:56.938
I was wrong.

38:16.304 --> 38:19.841
Emma. Emma! Are you all right?

38:23.255 --> 38:26.095
- Are you hurt?
- No. I don't think so, no.

38:26.135 --> 38:28.855
The stairs have collapsed.
It's bloody chaos.

38:28.895 --> 38:31.975
- Get everyone outside. You, too.
- No, I want to help!

38:32.015 --> 38:35.975
- I will not risk you. Mr. O'Hara?
- I'll see her out. Come on.

38:49.455 --> 38:52.095
We need to get as many as possible
out of the bar.

38:52.135 --> 38:54.295
Don't worry, we'll do what we can.

39:02.095 --> 39:04.175
Which way?

39:09.695 --> 39:13.415
Right, come on! Round to the left!
Don't stop till you get outside! Go!

39:13.455 --> 39:17.335
Round to the left! Quick as you can!
Don't stop till you're outside!

39:21.455 --> 39:24.415
That's it. This way.

39:29.535 --> 39:31.615
Adil!

39:31.655 --> 39:33.855
Adil!

39:38.255 --> 39:40.895
Adil! Adil!

39:58.735 --> 40:01.015
Emma's outside. She's fine.

40:01.055 --> 40:03.615
Mr. Garland, my mother.

40:03.655 --> 40:06.735
She's safe. I will attend to her.

40:06.775 --> 40:10.015
But there may be guests trapped
or injured on the first floor.

40:10.055 --> 40:13.055
We'll go. Come on.

40:14.855 --> 40:18.015
Come on! I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it. I love you!

40:18.055 --> 40:21.775
Come on! Come on!

40:24.815 --> 40:26.935
God, I thought I'd lost you.

40:33.295 --> 40:35.575
Hello?

40:35.615 --> 40:39.415
- In here, Robbie!
- Skinner. Can you cope? Yes.

40:42.575 --> 40:46.135
Lean on me. This way.

40:46.175 --> 40:48.215
You'll be all right.

40:54.575 --> 40:57.455
- William, check that back corridor!
- Yes, Mr. Reynolds!

40:57.495 --> 41:00.295
Keep moving. That's it. Thank you.

41:00.335 --> 41:02.495
- Max? Max!
- Robbie?

41:02.535 --> 41:04.620
Right, get your family and yourself
outside now!

41:04.645 --> 41:07.698
Where are you going?
There's still people trapped.

41:07.723 --> 41:11.295
Wait.

41:18.407 --> 41:20.807
- I'll make sure they're safe.
- Thank you.

41:20.847 --> 41:25.407
What did you say? I said
these people here were family too.

41:30.767 --> 41:33.847
- Keep moving to the exit.
- Quickly now!

41:40.887 --> 41:43.647
Put your hand here. There you go.

41:56.487 --> 41:58.447
Go to him.

42:53.047 --> 42:55.847
You won't be able to get in his room!

42:57.407 --> 42:59.247
I need to see for myself!

43:00.847 --> 43:03.367
The bomb damage
is mainly to the left wing.

43:03.407 --> 43:05.407
Mr. D'Abberville's room is gone.

43:06.387 --> 43:09.262
- What if someone finds out what we did?
- They won't.

43:09.287 --> 43:10.536
You don't know that!

43:10.607 --> 43:14.447
You're right, I don't.

43:14.487 --> 43:16.471
If we don't leave now,
we'll never get out.

43:16.496 --> 43:18.190
Your Ladyship!

43:21.167 --> 43:23.327
You shouldn't have come back for me.

43:25.287 --> 43:27.367
Probably not.

43:33.767 --> 43:38.047
Lead the way, Mr. Garland.

43:50.207 --> 43:54.327
Miss Day?
Miss Day, are you all right?

43:54.367 --> 43:56.567
Sonny got me out.

43:57.927 --> 44:00.087
And then he went back in.

44:01.087 --> 44:03.087
But he's not...

44:05.207 --> 44:07.207
I can't see him.

44:08.527 --> 44:10.727
I can't see him anywhere.

45:24.127 --> 45:26.927
Betsey!

45:29.767 --> 45:31.687
Betsey?

46:08.600 --> 46:10.935
