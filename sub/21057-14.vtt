00:36.640 --> 00:40.210
(The Lady in Dignity)

01:18.349 --> 01:20.620
Well, I hope this is not a discourteous thing to ask.

01:21.290 --> 01:24.590
Would you let me embellish your shoes if you trust my taste?

01:29.489 --> 01:31.659
Everything is in your hands now.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.230
Please don't worry.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.000
Just trust me.

01:36.900 --> 01:38.200
Let's get it done.

01:42.739 --> 01:45.579
Please sign here as well as on the last page.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.250
(Stock Transfer Agreement)

01:54.250 --> 01:56.689
(Assignee Park Bok Ja)

02:20.150 --> 02:23.110
It is said that God gives people three chances.

02:24.080 --> 02:28.150
That chance is often hidden in small decisions that pass us by,

02:28.250 --> 02:30.990
or within the process of making a choice.

02:43.740 --> 02:46.909
Our lives continue without any hesitation,

02:47.240 --> 02:51.310
and we encounter hidden opportunities multiple times a day.

02:51.780 --> 02:55.610
But not everyone is able to recognize it.

02:56.879 --> 02:58.419
This is amazing!

02:58.780 --> 03:01.819
The act of making a choice at the right time...

03:02.090 --> 03:04.319
is what we call an opportunity.

03:13.199 --> 03:15.169
Go break her.

03:15.669 --> 03:17.370
We must not let her go any further...

03:18.000 --> 03:19.870
or have her way.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.270
Cripple her.

03:27.949 --> 03:31.580
However, as soon as the choice is made after the right timing,

03:31.879 --> 03:33.250
it becomes a tragedy.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.729
Hello?

03:41.960 --> 03:43.830
Yes.

03:44.860 --> 03:45.900
Yes.

03:46.830 --> 03:48.169
I understand.

03:48.469 --> 03:52.300
In the end, life is all about timing.

03:52.539 --> 03:54.039
- Are you serious? - Yes.

03:54.110 --> 03:56.069
An official notice was just posted at the company.

03:56.110 --> 03:58.479
There will be a shareholder meeting tomorrow afternoon.

03:58.810 --> 04:00.849
Why didn't anyone tell me about that?

04:01.150 --> 04:04.080
I told you. Ms. Park told me to inform you about it.

04:04.319 --> 04:07.490
But no one consulted me about this!

04:07.490 --> 04:08.520
Can they do this?

04:09.319 --> 04:12.990
I'm sorry to say this, but I think you've been kicked out.

04:14.629 --> 04:15.629
Kicked out?

04:15.629 --> 04:17.959
It's exactly how it sounds. I think you've been kicked out.

04:18.660 --> 04:19.759
Kicked to the curb.

04:22.970 --> 04:25.100
You know, I was planning...

04:25.100 --> 04:27.709
to work really hard from now on.

04:27.740 --> 04:30.639
I know, but everything's about timing.

04:32.709 --> 04:34.009
Gosh, seriously!

04:35.079 --> 04:36.350
Go, Honey.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.519
- Come home early. - Okay.

04:39.750 --> 04:43.459
I gave Ms. Cheon the menu, so don't forget to eat.

04:43.519 --> 04:44.819
I'll see you at home tonight.

04:44.819 --> 04:47.360
I like it when you speak using your dialect.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.060
But people are watching.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.500
I should stop using my dialect from now on.

04:53.800 --> 04:54.930
Okay.

05:08.079 --> 05:09.850
The gift tax is crazy.

05:10.079 --> 05:12.750
So you have to fix your annual salary to over five million dollars.

05:13.319 --> 05:15.720
You can use that salary to pay the gift tax,

05:16.089 --> 05:19.689
since you can pay it off in increments or all at once.

05:20.089 --> 05:24.029
But, if you sell your shares to our funding group before then,

05:24.199 --> 05:26.870
we can give you a deposit that you can use to pay off the gift tax.

05:27.300 --> 05:30.300
Which means that your annual salary won't matter.

05:37.839 --> 05:38.910
Mr. Han?

05:40.250 --> 05:42.480
I would also like to join...

05:42.910 --> 05:44.519
the Seven Princesses gathering tomorrow.

05:52.389 --> 05:53.790
I said you can't!

05:53.990 --> 05:56.329
You can't set a foot in this room!

05:56.360 --> 05:59.699
I have to work on my paintings. I'm going to use this room as my studio.

06:00.370 --> 06:01.399
Oh my!

06:34.399 --> 06:36.230
Where did you get that bag?

06:36.800 --> 06:39.170
This is another bag I designed myself.

06:39.540 --> 06:42.569
Can you design one for me, as well?

06:43.110 --> 06:45.980
A bag that will suit me perfectly.

06:46.379 --> 06:48.350
Of course! I'd glad to.

07:48.509 --> 07:49.769
It's me, A Jin.

07:50.540 --> 07:53.850
Would you like to have a quick lunch with me and Gi Ok?

07:54.449 --> 07:57.279
It would be near the gallery where I work. Is that okay?

07:58.350 --> 08:00.149
The gallery where I held the bazaar last time.

08:08.589 --> 08:12.600
I'm going to get a medical note and sue that woman.

08:14.670 --> 08:18.069
How much do I have to pay you to get out of this house? How much?

08:20.069 --> 08:22.639
I'm an artist.

08:22.639 --> 08:25.439
I'm at a whole different level than you who eats and plays for a living.

08:25.910 --> 08:28.009
Time is money. And don't you know...

08:28.009 --> 08:30.319
the importance of workspace for an artist?

08:31.449 --> 08:32.850
How would you know?

08:33.750 --> 08:35.919
I can't even count how many paintings I lost.

08:36.919 --> 08:38.320
All the time I wasted...

08:42.860 --> 08:43.899
Listen.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.830
I'll give you money, so please get out of here.

08:47.330 --> 08:48.870
How much can you give me?

08:48.870 --> 08:51.639
I'll consult him about it.

08:52.039 --> 08:53.610
You want this house, right?

08:54.110 --> 08:57.080
I'll give you compensation for this house, so get out.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.610
Hey, mistress.

08:59.610 --> 09:02.509
I was going to wrap things up and leave quietly,

09:03.179 --> 09:05.279
but you picked a fight with me first.

09:06.019 --> 09:07.850
I just wanted to make that clear.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.690
You just relieved me of my burdens.

09:15.190 --> 09:16.460
My gosh.

09:26.169 --> 09:27.309
Mr. Chairman.

09:30.110 --> 09:32.110
I have something to tell you.

09:34.980 --> 09:38.450
She used to work with me at a bar.

09:39.250 --> 09:42.120
At the time, she went by the name of Cho Hui,

09:42.419 --> 09:44.320
and she was very popular.

09:44.659 --> 09:48.259
And regarding her jail time due to fraud and embezzlement,

09:48.360 --> 09:50.899
I'm not sure what kind of stories you've heard...

09:50.899 --> 09:54.200
Is it true she had a daughter with leukemia?

09:55.230 --> 09:57.639
No, it was all a lie.

09:59.899 --> 10:01.370
Be careful.

10:01.740 --> 10:04.740
As I watched from close proximity, I didn't think this was right...

10:05.340 --> 10:07.649
Don't trust Park Bok Ja too much.

10:08.110 --> 10:10.879
I'm sorry I waited all this time to tell you.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.019
I got it, so you can go.

10:17.360 --> 10:20.230
The wrong timing leads to misfortune.

10:39.279 --> 10:40.950
Cheers.

10:45.080 --> 10:48.320
Then, since you haven't formally announced it yet,

10:48.320 --> 10:49.350
there's no article on it, right?

10:49.850 --> 10:52.759
An article will come out right after the shareholders meeting tomorrow.

10:52.889 --> 10:54.759
I knew it was too quiet.

10:55.659 --> 10:57.899
Only their second eldest son knows about this.

10:57.899 --> 11:00.730
But it's not like he can do anything even if he knows about it.

11:01.169 --> 11:03.899
Plus, he probably has no idea...

11:03.899 --> 11:05.799
about the share disposal.

11:19.019 --> 11:20.889
Come in. I need to talk to you about something.

11:27.190 --> 11:28.330
I'm...

11:28.830 --> 11:30.960
going to start my second life with you.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.799
I was very conflicted in making this decision.

11:34.070 --> 11:35.629
I'll bet my life on you.

11:35.700 --> 11:38.240
So, you have to make a decision, too.

11:38.600 --> 11:39.899
Is it me or that woman?

11:40.710 --> 11:41.809
Seong Hui.

11:43.009 --> 11:45.080
What happened to your face this time?

11:45.940 --> 11:48.610
Did A Jin hit you? Then did you hit her, too?

11:48.610 --> 11:50.450
Stop the nonsense and make a decision!

11:50.450 --> 11:52.820
This bruise on my face isn't important right now!

11:53.789 --> 11:56.990
I won't let anyone take you from me.

11:58.019 --> 11:59.059
You're mine.

11:59.460 --> 12:02.960
Yeah. I'm yours, then.

12:03.399 --> 12:06.399
- I gave myself to you. - Stop with the play on words!

12:06.529 --> 12:10.240
But I'm definitely not getting a divorce.

12:11.700 --> 12:14.269
- What? - Should I be honest? The thing is,

12:14.610 --> 12:18.409
I think about you at night, and I think about A Jin during the day.

12:18.639 --> 12:19.710
What is this?

12:20.649 --> 12:22.679
Then are you saying you love me in a physical way...

12:23.250 --> 12:25.480
while you love that woman in a mental way, or what?

12:25.679 --> 12:27.320
No, that's not it, either.

12:27.919 --> 12:31.320
In other words, A Jin is my sun and you're my moon.

12:31.320 --> 12:32.490
That's what it is.

12:32.490 --> 12:33.730
You better...

12:34.889 --> 12:36.360
get rid of that sun.

12:37.330 --> 12:38.629
You're all mine.

12:38.929 --> 12:41.769
Seong Hui, I'm really tired today.

12:43.070 --> 12:44.899
Father gave all of my stocks...

12:44.899 --> 12:47.070
to that woman he married.

12:48.570 --> 12:50.809
What? What did you say?

12:51.009 --> 12:53.809
My head hurts. I think it's time to depend on medicine.

12:53.809 --> 12:55.980
Wait, what did you just say?

12:55.980 --> 12:59.549
Are you saying the company has been passed over to your stepmother?

13:00.850 --> 13:03.659
- I think so. - Hey, you idiot!

13:03.789 --> 13:06.159
What have you been doing all this time?

13:06.159 --> 13:09.190
What else? I loved you!

13:10.129 --> 13:13.129
In other words, I exchanged the company for you.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.669
You idiot! Hey, you idiot!

13:17.740 --> 13:21.539
I've completely won over the reporters.

13:21.610 --> 13:23.409
You even won over the reporters?

13:23.809 --> 13:26.139
Gosh, of course, Mr. Han.

13:26.750 --> 13:30.620
Our world is more emotional than you would expect.

13:31.179 --> 13:33.350
You don't necessarily have to spend...

13:33.350 --> 13:37.320
a lot of money to move someone's heart.

13:37.590 --> 13:38.659
I knew it.

13:38.860 --> 13:42.590
I fully sensed that kind of aura around you, Ms. Park.

13:44.360 --> 13:47.100
I'll make my next move as quietly as possible.

13:47.230 --> 13:48.899
Then, I'll get things ready

13:49.070 --> 13:51.600
for the next step as quietly as possible.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.039
Quietly.

14:04.120 --> 14:05.549
I had a daughter.

14:06.990 --> 14:09.190
But seven years ago,

14:10.220 --> 14:11.990
she developed leukemia.

14:12.360 --> 14:16.429
So, I ended up in prison.

14:17.500 --> 14:21.070
I was there to hurt Ms. Park Bok Ja, who is your wife now.

14:22.230 --> 14:23.970
I mean, this lady here...

14:25.269 --> 14:28.110
visited me at the gym and gave me an envelope with cash inside.

14:28.610 --> 14:29.940
He's putting on a show, Father.

14:30.710 --> 14:33.080
I bet he's colluding with this woman.

14:33.210 --> 14:34.779
She's the mastermind behind it.

14:34.779 --> 14:37.850
Shut it! How dare you spew such nonsense?

14:38.350 --> 14:41.750
Honey. I'm okay,

14:42.149 --> 14:44.190
so let's not make a fuss about this.

14:44.590 --> 14:46.889
Don't trust Park Bok Ja too much.

14:47.460 --> 14:48.960
After all this time...

15:21.159 --> 15:24.600
Ma'am, I'm going to the police station to charge you with assault.

15:27.269 --> 15:29.629
I'll join you in making that charge!

15:30.070 --> 15:32.840
This is nonsense! I never hit you!

15:33.039 --> 15:35.110
I definitely got hit.

15:35.409 --> 15:38.110
I'm hurting everywhere including my back and bottom.

15:38.110 --> 15:41.279
If I get it diagnosed, I'll have to be hospitalized for 50 weeks!

15:45.279 --> 15:47.049
What is this lady?

15:55.889 --> 15:58.259
- You knew, didn't you? - About what?

15:59.899 --> 16:02.200
About Dr. Jang and Gyeong Hui seeing each other.

16:04.299 --> 16:07.440
You knew. I can tell by the look on your face.

16:07.940 --> 16:10.610
How did you find out about that?

16:12.179 --> 16:15.049
This is no ordinary matter.

16:15.909 --> 16:17.419
A death could result from it.

16:17.419 --> 16:19.450
Bong Sik found out.

16:21.350 --> 16:25.559
Dr. Jang ordered someone to beat up Bong Sik in that parking lot, right?

16:26.690 --> 16:29.159
No, he said he didn't.

16:29.159 --> 16:30.529
Who said he didn't do it?

16:31.960 --> 16:34.100
Dr. Jang told Gi Ok...

16:34.230 --> 16:36.100
that it really wasn't him.

16:37.139 --> 16:39.370
Of course, he said that. Why would he admit to it?

16:40.370 --> 16:43.039
There isn't a single proper person in that group.

16:45.210 --> 16:47.009
This is no ordinary matter.

16:47.509 --> 16:49.679
Bong Sik won't let Dr. Jang get away with this.

16:50.379 --> 16:53.789
He even got her pregnant. This can't get any worse!

16:59.419 --> 17:00.730
Have you been well?

17:01.059 --> 17:03.429
- You know how it is. - Do Hyeon's going abroad?

17:03.429 --> 17:06.029
- To Sherman School? - Yes, he's going next month.

17:07.098 --> 17:08.700
You must have a lot on your mind.

17:09.598 --> 17:10.839
You know how it is.

17:11.569 --> 17:13.670
Gi Ok said she's going to be around 10 minutes late.

17:13.670 --> 17:15.039
Yes, I heard.

17:16.170 --> 17:17.980
You must be having a tough time these days.

17:18.410 --> 17:19.579
You know how it is.

17:20.579 --> 17:24.279
Rumor about my husband dumping me has spread all over Gangnam, right?

17:24.348 --> 17:27.750
What? That's nonsense. How were you dumped?

17:27.750 --> 17:31.119
If you were dumped, I was dumped as soon as I got married.

17:32.490 --> 17:34.960
Gosh, men are so cheap.

17:37.230 --> 17:40.029
Hyo Ju, can you help me with something?

17:41.930 --> 17:43.470
I was wondering...

17:43.769 --> 17:46.640
if I can use your blog. Can I do that?

17:46.769 --> 17:48.970
Anytime.

17:49.039 --> 17:51.480
I'll do anything I can do to help.

17:51.609 --> 17:52.910
Just let me know, okay?

17:53.910 --> 17:55.250
- I'm here. - Hey.

18:01.490 --> 18:03.049
Why are you looking at me like that?

18:03.789 --> 18:06.190
I feel embarrassed caking on makeup as if I struck gold,

18:06.190 --> 18:07.390
so I do the bare minimum.

18:07.789 --> 18:08.930
Why?

18:09.059 --> 18:10.329
It's been a long time, Gi Ok.

18:10.930 --> 18:13.500
It's really been a long time. You don't come out for yoga anymore.

18:13.670 --> 18:14.829
I heard you moved.

18:14.900 --> 18:17.140
Yes, have you been well?

18:18.440 --> 18:21.240
Let's not ask each other if we've been well, okay?

18:21.509 --> 18:23.710
I guess there's no way we've been well.

18:23.839 --> 18:25.079
You're so lame.

18:27.380 --> 18:29.779
I must have really loved him.

18:30.819 --> 18:33.119
When I saw him with another woman...

18:34.619 --> 18:36.450
I felt furious.

18:36.589 --> 18:39.720
I didn't know I was that tacky, either.

18:41.660 --> 18:43.799
I don't think I'm a Gangnam woman, after all.

18:43.930 --> 18:46.299
That's how men and women differ.

18:46.769 --> 18:49.099
Men are able to sleep with women they don't love,

18:49.299 --> 18:52.000
but women can't sleep with a man they don't have feelings for.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.140
All women feel physically attached and fall in love...

18:54.140 --> 18:55.339
after sleeping with a man.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.079
That's why it's unfair from the very beginning.

18:58.509 --> 19:02.380
I'm just going to keep seeing him as if nothing happened.

19:04.019 --> 19:07.119
I'll give him what he needs, and receive what I need.

19:07.349 --> 19:09.420
I'm just going to continue this business relationship.

19:11.490 --> 19:14.029
I guess love isn't a part of my fate.

19:15.059 --> 19:18.700
Why wouldn't it be? I'm certain that it lies ahead.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.730
It's just hard to find real love at the right time.

19:22.599 --> 19:26.500
If I think about it, I think love is all about timing.

19:30.009 --> 19:31.539
Let's have some dessert.

19:32.380 --> 19:33.609
Yes, ma'am.

19:34.210 --> 19:36.880
- Three Shakeratos, please. - Sure, I'll get it ready.

19:37.680 --> 19:40.750
Trust me and give it a try. The Shakerato here is amazing.

19:41.019 --> 19:43.420
- I don't doubt it. - I need to use the washroom.

19:47.990 --> 19:49.490
Gi Ok, we're in trouble.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.460
I heard from my husband that Bong Sik...

19:52.460 --> 19:54.829
found out about Gyeong Hui and Dr. Jang.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.500
This incident blew out of proportion.

19:58.670 --> 20:01.210
- What? - I don't think Bong Sik...

20:01.210 --> 20:02.670
will let Dr. Jang get away with it.

20:03.480 --> 20:04.880
I'm worried.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.519
"Initial public offering."

20:15.450 --> 20:19.619
It's difficult to be accepted as a member of Seven Princesses.

20:19.759 --> 20:23.130
They're all women who possess moral influence and intelligence.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.529
Yes?

20:30.099 --> 20:31.140
Ms. Park.

20:35.809 --> 20:37.079
I'll escort you.

20:37.309 --> 20:38.779
No, that's okay.

20:39.180 --> 20:41.549
I'll call you if I need you when I'm finished.

20:41.680 --> 20:44.079
I'm going to a personal gathering today.

20:44.950 --> 20:47.650
I'd like you to keep Mr. Chairman company instead.

20:47.789 --> 20:48.890
Pardon?

20:49.549 --> 20:53.019
He's going to feel very lonely from now on.

20:58.460 --> 21:01.470
Don't spread the news item even after the shareholders meeting.

21:01.869 --> 21:04.869
Only spread it after I personally call Mr. Kim...

21:05.039 --> 21:06.500
in the PR department.

21:12.609 --> 21:15.549
Don't mess with me.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.420
If you do,

21:19.450 --> 21:21.150
you'll be the one kicked out.

21:22.690 --> 21:24.319
Stop it!

21:25.319 --> 21:27.990
Before I humiliate you in front of your son!

21:28.490 --> 21:31.430
This world doesn't function based on the truth.

21:31.799 --> 21:34.299
What makes it function is what becomes the truth.

21:34.700 --> 21:36.700
Go break her.

21:37.140 --> 21:39.569
I must teach that woman a lesson.

21:40.140 --> 21:41.240
Will you be able to do it?

21:41.670 --> 21:42.710
No.

21:43.240 --> 21:44.779
You have to do it.

22:23.279 --> 22:26.750
You promised you would leave after Father's birthday.

22:26.950 --> 22:28.119
I'm...

22:30.619 --> 22:31.789
not going to...

22:33.259 --> 22:36.359
take a single step outside this house.

22:38.160 --> 22:39.529
What is it that you want?

22:41.799 --> 22:44.769
Tell me what you want.

22:47.210 --> 22:49.640
Tell me. What is it that you want?

22:57.619 --> 22:59.480
I want...

23:06.930 --> 23:08.059
Yes, Mr. Han.

23:08.960 --> 23:11.359
Yes, I'm almost there.

23:12.099 --> 23:13.200
Okay.

23:16.130 --> 23:17.700
Goodness.

23:18.470 --> 23:21.809
Last night, Seung Sook's husband farted after falling asleep,

23:21.809 --> 23:24.039
so it smelled so bad!

23:24.339 --> 23:26.880
- Tell us about it. - About what?

23:26.880 --> 23:29.950
I mean, A Jin and that woman are living in the same house.

23:30.579 --> 23:32.920
This isn't any ordinary entertainment.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.519
I don't want to hear it!

23:34.690 --> 23:37.819
A Jin's head already hurts because of the rumors around town,

23:38.259 --> 23:40.990
saying that the mistress and wife are living in the same house.

23:41.559 --> 23:45.000
Have you heard? Bong Sik's wife is pregnant.

23:45.230 --> 23:48.069
- But it's not Bong Sik's child! - Hey!

23:48.200 --> 23:50.900
- That's nonsense! - Quiet down!

23:51.269 --> 23:52.900
This isn't Pung Suk's Kitchen.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.910
But don't you think our boss at Pung Suk's Kitchen...

23:56.039 --> 23:57.579
has changed lately?

23:57.910 --> 24:01.480
She used to join us at the sauna, but she said she won't come anymore.

24:01.480 --> 24:03.579
She's saying she made all the money she wanted!

24:06.250 --> 24:08.589
Money changes people.

24:08.920 --> 24:12.420
She's saying she's at a different level than us now.

24:12.559 --> 24:16.089
I'm not surprised. Seeing how Bok Ja's life turned around,

24:16.660 --> 24:18.960
maybe our origin doesn't matter after all.

24:19.329 --> 24:22.200
- Money makes the person! - Gosh!

24:22.869 --> 24:26.299
Is it because this is cheap? I can't seem to wash it off.

24:28.309 --> 24:30.539
Okay, this is bourbon from Russia.

24:30.910 --> 24:32.480
Why don't you try a glass?

24:57.440 --> 24:58.940
Do we have a new Mister?

24:59.099 --> 25:00.140
Yes, ma'am.

25:00.710 --> 25:02.869
- Do you have a sponsor? - Don't be like that.

25:03.109 --> 25:06.410
Is he yours? Why are you making him do things like this?

25:06.509 --> 25:09.609
He said he wanted to say hello, so I brought him with me.

25:10.049 --> 25:11.480
He's handsome.

25:12.750 --> 25:14.920
This is delicious. Cheers.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.619
When will our new member be here?

25:27.500 --> 25:30.200
Hello, I'm Park Ji Yeong.

25:33.039 --> 25:35.609
Let's cheers one more time. Here, cheers.

25:35.609 --> 25:37.609
- Cheers! - Cheers!

25:49.450 --> 25:52.420
Then shall we test our new member?

25:52.420 --> 25:53.990
- Let's bring her out. - Okay.

25:54.329 --> 25:56.230
Ma'am, please come out!

26:02.269 --> 26:03.329
Goodness!

26:07.509 --> 26:08.740
Me?

26:22.390 --> 26:24.390
Whoa! What is this?

26:25.660 --> 26:27.759
Gosh!

26:31.500 --> 26:32.630
Gosh!

26:37.670 --> 26:40.069
- Allow her to join! - Bravo!

26:45.910 --> 26:48.450
What the... Darn it!

26:54.690 --> 26:56.819
I'm sorry. I'm late, aren't I?

26:57.089 --> 26:59.289
My client is so busy.

26:59.559 --> 27:02.730
What else can I do? I have to make a living. I'm sorry.

27:05.660 --> 27:08.599
- There's a hearing at 3pm tomorrow. - Okay.

27:08.829 --> 27:11.000
It's for his fraudulent act. The thing is,

27:11.099 --> 27:13.839
I wanted to combine it with the UN Village's ownership issue,

27:13.940 --> 27:15.839
but that will take too long.

27:16.809 --> 27:19.539
So let's do that separately with Ji Hu's custody case.

27:19.539 --> 27:21.109
Okay, let's do that.

27:21.109 --> 27:23.150
You have a 100 percent of winning your divorce case,

27:23.150 --> 27:26.619
so let's win that and bounce back to move onto other cases.

27:26.650 --> 27:28.490
I'll leave it up to you.

27:28.490 --> 27:31.420
I want to make it so that the ruling will be made in the first trial.

27:31.990 --> 27:33.690
You'll really do that for me, right?

27:33.930 --> 27:35.160
Of course.

27:37.529 --> 27:38.599
Thank you.

27:39.299 --> 27:40.369
For what?

27:41.130 --> 27:42.470
For helping me like this.

27:43.640 --> 27:46.339
I'll continue to make you thankful from now on.

27:46.640 --> 27:47.869
You can look forward to it.

27:50.440 --> 27:53.480
But has the defendant's side appointed a lawyer?

27:53.480 --> 27:55.009
I heard they haven't.

27:55.279 --> 27:57.619
I think Seong Hui has appointed one, though.

27:57.750 --> 27:59.720
I sent her a notice regarding the fraudulence case.

28:00.190 --> 28:03.119
So you're saying you put the house that was under her husband's name...

28:03.119 --> 28:05.019
under your name,

28:05.089 --> 28:08.029
but the woman moved in, insisting it's her house, right?

28:08.029 --> 28:10.630
- And she sent you this notice. - That's what we're telling you.

28:12.022 --> 28:14.363
Do you plan to marry Ahn Jae Seok...

28:14.388 --> 28:17.317
after that woman and Ahn Jae Seok get divorced?

28:19.970 --> 28:22.710
I'm not sure about that...

28:22.970 --> 28:24.039
What's wrong with you?

28:24.039 --> 28:27.549
Mom, it looks like he's going to lose the company.

28:28.480 --> 28:31.119
- What? - I might go crazy.

28:31.880 --> 28:33.049
Mom!

28:36.920 --> 28:38.190
Dad!

28:42.430 --> 28:44.230
Has our little princess been well?

28:45.029 --> 28:47.829
Do you want to eat some delicious food with Dad? Get in.

28:50.099 --> 28:52.970
I'm making hash browns that our princess loves so much.

28:56.109 --> 28:57.140
Dad?

28:58.309 --> 29:00.910
Okay, then. Eat lots of delicious food with Dad, okay?

29:01.809 --> 29:03.180
I love you sweetie.

29:12.460 --> 29:13.730
Who is it?

29:19.400 --> 29:20.500
Is it true?

29:20.569 --> 29:23.200
Is it true that the wife and mistress are living here together?

29:24.440 --> 29:27.039
- Who are you? - President of the women's society.

29:27.039 --> 29:28.940
- I'm the general affairs officer. - I'm the auditor.

29:28.940 --> 29:31.309
- I'm the director. - Isn't this too crazy...

29:31.309 --> 29:33.009
for our apartment's reputation?

29:33.009 --> 29:36.150
Your household's story is all over the internet!

29:36.150 --> 29:38.349
Oh no. I'm sorry.

29:38.549 --> 29:39.920
I'm deeply ashamed.

29:41.549 --> 29:42.990
Why don't you come inside?

29:43.089 --> 29:45.259
And just so you know, I'm the wife.

29:45.390 --> 29:47.829
The mistress is out at the moment. Come inside.

29:55.329 --> 29:56.970
Ji Hu, what are you listening to today?

30:06.180 --> 30:08.049
Let's listen to your music together, Dad.

30:08.309 --> 30:10.079
You don't like this kind of music, though.

30:11.180 --> 30:13.789
I'm going to do my best to understand you.

30:14.549 --> 30:16.690
No matter what other people say,

30:17.160 --> 30:20.430
I love you, Dad.

30:39.039 --> 30:40.480
I'm sorry.

30:43.309 --> 30:47.049
I'm sure Hansel and Gretel's dad had his reasons.

30:47.849 --> 30:51.690
And I'm sure Cinderella's dad had his reasons.

30:52.789 --> 30:56.430
So, I'm sure you had your reasons, too.

31:07.339 --> 31:08.869
What do I do now?

31:09.640 --> 31:12.480
Hey, you heard what the lawyer asked.

31:12.680 --> 31:15.680
Did you write a memorandum when you changed the ownership?

31:15.680 --> 31:17.750
Why couldn't you answer him properly?

31:18.319 --> 31:20.390
It said something about nominal trust,

31:21.019 --> 31:24.119
but there were too many forms, so I just stamped all of them.

31:24.289 --> 31:25.720
You have the forms at home, right?

31:25.859 --> 31:27.930
- Yes, I think so. - Where?

31:30.029 --> 31:32.759
That's why I took off his pants...

31:32.960 --> 31:35.930
in the middle of it!

31:38.400 --> 31:41.609
You should have bought him a car as an apology.

31:41.609 --> 31:44.009
All I did was take off his pants!

31:44.009 --> 31:46.210
Why should I buy him a car?

31:58.059 --> 32:01.089
Those dirty hags.

32:03.460 --> 32:06.099
Besides having a lot of money,

32:06.099 --> 32:10.200
they're practically just like lowly scums.

32:11.769 --> 32:13.200
What is it that you want?

32:16.880 --> 32:20.079
Tell me what you want.

32:23.880 --> 32:27.349
You can tell me. What do you want?

32:27.349 --> 32:30.019
Woo A Jin. I can finally...

32:30.259 --> 32:32.789
tell you exactly what I want.

32:32.960 --> 32:34.089
Cash!

32:34.730 --> 32:37.299
There's nothing special about the upper class.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.170
All it takes is cash. Cash.

32:45.839 --> 32:47.039
Don't kiss me.

32:47.940 --> 32:48.970
Why not?

32:49.940 --> 32:51.480
Just don't do it.

32:53.109 --> 32:54.380
I'm going to wash up first.

33:15.730 --> 33:16.799
Take it.

33:17.839 --> 33:21.309
I don't feel like rolling around with you today.

33:24.710 --> 33:26.950
- Hyo Ju. - What?

33:27.150 --> 33:30.079
You really like me, don't you?

33:31.980 --> 33:33.220
It's not like that.

33:38.019 --> 33:39.119
By the way,

33:39.559 --> 33:42.460
you said one of your friends whom I met on the yacht...

33:42.759 --> 33:44.700
is dating one of my friends.

33:44.900 --> 33:45.930
Who is it?

33:46.400 --> 33:48.430
- I don't know his name. - Is he a player?

33:48.430 --> 33:49.599
No, he's not.

33:50.269 --> 33:53.869
He worked for her for a month. But he quit because it wasn't his thing.

33:54.440 --> 33:57.380
It's not easy to quit after getting a taste of money.

33:57.809 --> 34:01.349
Who's the woman? You'll recognize her if I show you a picture, right?

34:01.680 --> 34:04.920
I can't tell you, though. My friend asked me to keep it a secret.

34:05.319 --> 34:06.950
- Are they still seeing each other? - Yes.

34:07.490 --> 34:08.619
They love each other.

34:11.590 --> 34:13.429
Should I really go?

34:14.889 --> 34:16.190
Yes, go.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.559
- Come on, let's just do it. - I told you to go!

34:52.260 --> 34:53.329
Honey,

34:53.500 --> 34:55.829
when you transferred the house over to my name,

34:55.829 --> 34:58.340
we signed a trust agreement, didn't we?

35:00.610 --> 35:03.070
You know the agreement we signed that you said you would keep

35:03.070 --> 35:04.510
just for formalities.

35:04.510 --> 35:07.280
- Seong Hui, let's... - I'm...

35:07.409 --> 35:08.949
going to bury my bones in this house.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.449
Where's that memorandum?

35:10.750 --> 35:13.389
When you put this house under her name,

35:13.389 --> 35:16.050
did you sign a memorandum that said it's under her name...

35:16.090 --> 35:18.159
but the real owner is Ahn Jae Seok?

35:18.260 --> 35:20.489
- That's what we signed, isn't it? - Hold on.

35:21.289 --> 35:23.090
That's not what's important here.

35:25.260 --> 35:28.329
I need to talk to both of you.

35:28.599 --> 35:32.070
Please listen to what I'm about to say very carefully.

35:33.369 --> 35:35.010
I'm going to make a shocking announcement.

35:35.010 --> 35:36.679
Hello, residents.

35:36.809 --> 35:39.510
I'm a resident living in building 105, apartment 303.

35:40.010 --> 35:43.050
- I'm here to deliver a message. - What's this?

35:43.309 --> 35:47.219
In apartment 303, a wife and mistress are living together,

35:47.219 --> 35:51.619
causing frequent disorder in a wretched living space.

35:52.090 --> 35:55.030
I'd like to sincerely apologize for bringing down...

35:55.030 --> 35:56.659
the dignity of UN Top Village,

35:56.659 --> 35:58.260
which is known as a high-quality living space.

35:58.429 --> 35:59.530
I apologize.

35:59.829 --> 36:02.130
I will correct this corruption as soon as possible.

36:02.130 --> 36:05.039
And in order to protect the dignity of UN Top Village,

36:05.039 --> 36:07.369
I will solemnly promise I will do my very best...

36:07.369 --> 36:11.179
to quickly resolve this grotesque cohabitation issue of a mistress

36:11.210 --> 36:16.010
who is illegally occupying our living space.

36:16.349 --> 36:19.480
Additionally, I ask that you to take part in our signature campaign...

36:19.550 --> 36:22.090
in order to recover our proper living space.

36:22.289 --> 36:24.719
Thank you, and I wish you happiness everyone.

36:28.889 --> 36:31.260
Imagine how desperate I would have been to move in here.

36:31.500 --> 36:33.329
I even left my daughter with my mother.

36:33.500 --> 36:37.469
What a wench! You shouldn't let her get away with that!

36:37.469 --> 36:39.340
Your baby's father is the worst!

36:39.340 --> 36:42.409
I apologize, everyone.

36:42.710 --> 36:44.679
I will resolve this as soon as possible.

36:45.079 --> 36:47.710
We should recover the apartment's high-quality image.

36:48.309 --> 36:50.719
But in order to do that, I need your help.

36:50.849 --> 36:52.880
Just tell us. We'll do whatever we can to help.

36:54.050 --> 36:56.090
I'm thinking of running a signature campaign...

36:56.449 --> 36:59.219
to recover our proper living space.

37:00.929 --> 37:03.030
I need to make my shocking announcement.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.300
But she's taking the initiative.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.269
I can't deal with this.

37:08.829 --> 37:11.199
I'm too embarrassed to go on.

37:12.469 --> 37:14.110
Let's sue her for defamation!

37:21.579 --> 37:22.610
Hello?

37:24.079 --> 37:25.119
What?

37:25.119 --> 37:27.190
Chairman Ahn Tae Dong of Daesung Pulp...

37:27.190 --> 37:31.659
gave 53.41 percentage of his own treasury stocks...

37:31.659 --> 37:34.289
to his wife, Park Ji Yeong,

37:34.289 --> 37:36.800
which is shocking the financial world.

37:37.260 --> 37:39.760
As a result, Daesung Pulp, which has a history of 30 years...

37:39.760 --> 37:42.469
is now owned by the Vice-Chairwoman, Park Ji Yeong,

37:42.469 --> 37:44.570
in a historical turnaround.

37:47.969 --> 37:50.179
"Chairman Ahn Tae Dong Gives 53.41 Percent of His Shares..."

37:50.179 --> 37:51.840
"To Vice-Chairwoman Park Ji Yeong"

38:00.889 --> 38:02.449
(Message, Kang Ki Ho)

38:02.719 --> 38:03.889
Have you seen the news?

38:03.889 --> 38:05.989
About Daesung Pulp's change of major shareholder.

38:07.429 --> 38:10.659
"Chairman Ahn Tae Dong Gives 53.41 Percent of His Shares..."

38:10.659 --> 38:14.130
"To Vice-Chairwoman Park Ji Yeong"

38:21.170 --> 38:23.110
What will we do?

38:23.510 --> 38:26.280
Then, let's have a private talk with Dad tomorrow.

38:27.380 --> 38:30.579
I heard that company's sales have been really good these days.

38:31.179 --> 38:32.320
That's why.

38:32.920 --> 38:34.619
Let's ask him for some shares...

38:34.849 --> 38:37.219
and permission to participate in the managing the business.

38:37.760 --> 38:40.460
I'll be the director. You can be the managing director.

38:41.130 --> 38:44.630
No thanks. I'm going to leave as soon as I get my shares.

38:44.929 --> 38:46.030
To the States.

38:46.929 --> 38:47.969
With Ju Mi?

38:49.929 --> 38:50.969
Yes.

38:52.340 --> 38:54.070
You two sure are funny.

38:54.210 --> 38:56.340
Why did you overcook the squid?

38:56.809 --> 38:58.309
It's so tough, I might lose a tooth.

38:58.309 --> 38:59.510
Why didn't you bake it?

38:59.579 --> 39:01.579
And why did you mix in mayonnaise with soy sauce?

39:01.579 --> 39:03.210
This is how people eat it these days!

39:03.849 --> 39:06.480
- Is this the Gangnam way? - This is the Korean way.

39:08.090 --> 39:10.960
The new owner is Vice-Chairwoman Park Ji Yeong...

39:23.000 --> 39:24.139
Honey?

39:24.840 --> 39:25.869
Hey.

39:26.670 --> 39:30.440
Don't worry too much. I'll wrap it up properly.

39:31.940 --> 39:34.510
If we do that, I'll take all the insults...

39:35.110 --> 39:37.250
even if we sell the company.

39:37.880 --> 39:41.449
Okay, in any case, I believe in you, my love.

39:46.489 --> 39:48.329
I guess we were...

39:48.960 --> 39:50.630
a match made in heaven.

39:52.130 --> 39:54.329
Of course, we are.

39:55.869 --> 39:56.969
I...

39:57.300 --> 40:00.139
want to share many years with you...

40:00.639 --> 40:02.039
as a married couple.

40:03.809 --> 40:05.010
Me too.

40:05.739 --> 40:07.079
But you know what?

40:08.710 --> 40:10.579
I've lived long enough to know...

40:11.579 --> 40:15.150
that not everything goes my way.

40:23.289 --> 40:24.599
Thank you.

40:58.659 --> 41:01.030
I got the idea...

41:01.530 --> 41:03.199
that if I end up hating you, too,

41:03.800 --> 41:06.039
you'll have absolutely no one left on your side.

41:07.710 --> 41:09.940
I remember when you said, "Bok Ja, I'm sorry,"

41:10.909 --> 41:13.349
and you emptied out your entire wallet...

41:13.349 --> 41:15.210
and gave me 80 dollars.

41:18.219 --> 41:19.550
I forgave you...

41:21.190 --> 41:22.489
that day.

41:22.519 --> 41:25.760
Here's the 80 dollars you gave me when I got out of prison.

41:25.760 --> 41:27.460
It's a different game now.

41:28.760 --> 41:31.000
People who live roam about in the upper class...

41:31.900 --> 41:33.369
have completely different blood.

41:37.869 --> 41:39.139
I'm...

41:40.139 --> 41:42.210
no longer the Park Bok Ja from the past.

41:55.849 --> 41:56.960
I enjoyed the meal!

41:56.960 --> 41:58.420
- I had fun! - Get home safely!

41:58.420 --> 41:59.760
Okay, see you tomorrow!

41:59.920 --> 42:00.989
- Hello. - Nonhyeon-dong?

42:00.989 --> 42:03.130
- Yes. - Great, thank you very much.

42:26.349 --> 42:27.920
Are you going somewhere this late at night?

42:28.989 --> 42:30.889
It's a global management course gathering.

42:31.719 --> 42:35.190
They want to go for a drink because I took over a company.

42:36.230 --> 42:37.360
I see.

42:42.170 --> 42:43.639
Go to bed without me.

43:15.269 --> 43:17.400
Pack your bags and get out first thing in the morning.

43:18.340 --> 43:20.539
Get out of my sight.

43:22.010 --> 43:23.610
What's wrong, Cho Hui?

43:25.210 --> 43:26.909
You told Mr. Chairman about me, didn't you?

43:29.650 --> 43:33.219
I know everything just by looking at a person's expression.

43:35.619 --> 43:37.489
You know the kind of life that I've lived.

43:38.789 --> 43:39.860
I've...

43:40.760 --> 43:42.690
been stepped on...

43:43.500 --> 43:46.829
and looked down upon by countless people...

43:47.500 --> 43:49.599
and worried about what they thought about me.

43:53.739 --> 43:55.409
And I came out of it...

43:56.739 --> 43:58.010
with one advantage.

44:00.179 --> 44:01.179
I...

44:02.449 --> 44:04.550
can see everything.

44:05.150 --> 44:06.920
I felt like you were abandoning me.

44:07.949 --> 44:09.119
That's why.

44:11.420 --> 44:14.329
I wanted to abandon you because I knew you were like this.

44:16.159 --> 44:18.059
It was just as I expected.

44:24.369 --> 44:25.500
I'm...

44:28.369 --> 44:29.710
abandoning you now.

44:34.679 --> 44:35.679
Get out...

44:37.150 --> 44:38.980
of this house first thing in the morning.

44:41.719 --> 44:43.619
If you try to play another trick on me,

44:46.059 --> 44:47.130
I'll kill you.

45:09.179 --> 45:10.250
Mom.

45:11.349 --> 45:13.119
Are you worried about something?

45:13.280 --> 45:14.449
No. Why?

45:14.920 --> 45:17.590
Your emotions are always written all over your face.

45:17.659 --> 45:19.219
Is it because you have a pure soul?

45:20.159 --> 45:22.860
I read a line like that in a book yesterday.

45:23.130 --> 45:26.000
It said people with pure souls can't hide their emotions.

45:26.659 --> 45:28.400
You're a genius.

45:28.869 --> 45:31.570
It seems like you're worried about something other than Dad.

45:32.099 --> 45:33.199
Wow.

45:33.409 --> 45:36.409
When it's about Dad, your eyes look sad,

45:36.409 --> 45:39.710
but right now, your eyes look... how should I say it?

45:40.079 --> 45:41.150
They look angry.

45:41.750 --> 45:43.309
- Do I look angry? - Yes.

45:43.820 --> 45:46.050
Then, I should blow off some steam, shouldn't I?

45:46.150 --> 45:49.119
- You should. - Then you should sleep, right?

45:49.119 --> 45:50.289
I should.

45:50.789 --> 45:51.989
Kiss.

45:53.460 --> 45:55.389
Okay, let's go to bed.

45:55.389 --> 45:58.000
(6 Missed Calls, Dimwit Bong Cheol)

45:59.559 --> 46:03.000
Gosh, this worthless idiot.

46:07.010 --> 46:09.309
- Hello? - Can we meet right now?

46:12.539 --> 46:14.980
I have a gathering I need to get to.

46:16.110 --> 46:17.449
Let's meet up tomorrow.

46:18.579 --> 46:20.750
I have something to tell you anyway.

46:20.920 --> 46:22.690
Okay, see you tomorrow afternoon.

46:23.250 --> 46:24.289
Okay.

46:33.429 --> 46:35.769
What? Are you serious?

46:37.199 --> 46:40.610
Then did Dad give all of his stocks to that woman? All of it?

46:42.039 --> 46:44.710
Dad must be senile. That old man is crazy!

46:44.780 --> 46:46.110
Darn it.

46:48.150 --> 46:51.250
Why is everything going so wrong?

46:51.750 --> 46:55.650
Let's group together and try to overcome this shitty situation.

46:55.650 --> 46:57.659
Let's meet Dad tomorrow and tell him to cancel it!

46:57.659 --> 46:59.360
Jae Gu! Jae Seok!

46:59.489 --> 47:02.760
I can't! I'm busy tomorrow.

47:02.760 --> 47:04.530
What's more important than this?

47:04.860 --> 47:07.230
I have my divorce hearing!

47:08.030 --> 47:11.139
I have a divorce hearing tomorrow!

47:14.440 --> 47:17.210
- I have a divorce hearing... - Gosh, seriously!

47:24.780 --> 47:28.250
If you happen to grab me by the hair or something, you'll be on the news.

47:28.250 --> 47:31.090
So think before you act from now on.

47:31.360 --> 47:35.030
Your husband ruined my daughter's future!

47:35.059 --> 47:38.760
Oh my, I did? Didn't you love each other?

47:39.230 --> 47:43.300
In love, you must overcome all adversity and hardship.

47:44.500 --> 47:46.869
Did you love a married man without bracing yourself for this?

47:47.369 --> 47:49.739
I have a trial tomorrow. You should attend.

47:50.010 --> 47:52.809
You need to know the circumstances to be prepared.

47:52.809 --> 47:54.110
I better get going now.

48:10.860 --> 48:14.030
I'm late with the introductions, aren't I? I'll do that now.

48:14.670 --> 48:17.199
This is Ms. Park Dong Ju of Samcheong Boilers.

48:17.699 --> 48:19.469
It was recently listed in KOSDAQ.

48:20.610 --> 48:23.309
This is Ms. Yoo Young Ah of Zero Nine Construction.

48:23.539 --> 48:25.579
She took over Youngan Industries...

48:25.579 --> 48:27.579
and will sign a five million deal tomorrow.

48:28.280 --> 48:29.380
And this is...

48:29.809 --> 48:32.349
I'm Choi Ja Sil.

48:32.750 --> 48:36.489
At first, I also sold my company and got my hands on a lot of cash.

48:36.989 --> 48:39.320
I even managed funding firms with that money.

48:39.389 --> 48:41.329
She's the representative of CJS Investment Bank.

48:41.789 --> 48:44.500
Let's just say she plays a large role in our country's black economy.

48:45.329 --> 48:46.530
No need to introduce myself.

48:47.199 --> 48:50.500
You know how well our company's doing, don't you?

48:51.369 --> 48:53.239
I really like her.

48:55.269 --> 48:57.110
How much are you going to sell it for?

48:58.809 --> 49:00.309
I want 75 million dollars in cash.

49:00.880 --> 49:03.250
20 million dollars for the gift tax must be paid...

49:03.250 --> 49:04.820
by the Seven Princesses' joint account.

49:05.250 --> 49:07.889
And it must be deposited in advance before the transfer of stocks.

49:13.460 --> 49:14.860
Take it or leave it.

49:17.929 --> 49:19.800
We should discuss it, shouldn't we?

49:19.800 --> 49:22.900
Let's discuss it together. I'm a member, too.

49:26.239 --> 49:29.210
Okay, let's discuss it in a transparent manner.

49:31.079 --> 49:32.710
How about another toast?

49:34.909 --> 49:37.349
- Cheers? - Cheers!

50:25.030 --> 50:28.599
I think someone will buy the company soon.

50:29.170 --> 50:32.300
- Pardon? - I expressed my intention to sell,

50:32.500 --> 50:34.539
and quite a few buyers showed interest.

50:35.210 --> 50:36.980
You didn't even consult me about this.

50:38.239 --> 50:39.840
Anyway, that's good.

50:41.309 --> 50:43.579
Don't tell the kids about that for the time being.

50:44.150 --> 50:46.179
Why would I do that and cause a fuss?

50:47.619 --> 50:48.820
By the way,

50:49.320 --> 50:51.659
you know that Jae Seok's divorce hearing is today, right?

50:54.730 --> 50:55.760
My love.

50:57.030 --> 50:58.630
- Yes? - I...

51:00.329 --> 51:01.829
can't part ways with you.

51:05.239 --> 51:07.940
- Why do you say that... - I trust you.

51:11.480 --> 51:15.349
Why does that keep sounding like you can't trust me?

51:19.980 --> 51:22.250
I forgot that I have a meeting this morning.

51:23.320 --> 51:24.389
Don't...

51:25.989 --> 51:27.090
forget to eat.

51:27.960 --> 51:29.030
Honey!

51:41.969 --> 51:46.139
Yes, Mr. Han. I need you to speed up the process.

51:46.579 --> 51:47.610
Yes.

51:48.610 --> 51:49.980
Yes, please do that.

51:54.849 --> 51:58.190
Case 2017-10122.

51:58.460 --> 52:00.489
We will begin the divorce trial.

52:01.090 --> 52:02.789
Are both parties present?

52:03.400 --> 52:05.400
You were unable to come to terms through mediation.

52:06.530 --> 52:09.099
The plaintiff's lawyer may give his statement.

52:12.139 --> 52:16.510
The plaintiff and defendant were legally wed in May of 2007...

52:16.570 --> 52:18.440
and currently have one daughter.

52:19.510 --> 52:22.480
The defendant, Ahn Jae Seok started having an affair...

52:22.610 --> 52:26.150
with his daughter's art teacher, Yun Seong Hui since October of 2016,

52:26.280 --> 52:28.090
and caused his marriage to fail.

52:29.320 --> 52:31.519
He is even living with the so-called Yun Seong Hui...

52:31.519 --> 52:33.989
and committed acts of brutality...

52:34.230 --> 52:36.030
that prevented their marriage from surviving.

52:36.030 --> 52:39.460
The defendant's actions fall under Article 840, Clause 1,

52:39.900 --> 52:42.429
for wrongful conduct toward his spouse,

52:42.570 --> 52:44.440
and Article 840, Clause 6,

52:45.039 --> 52:47.010
for providing a critical reason...

52:47.010 --> 52:48.969
that makes it difficult for the marriage to continue,

52:48.969 --> 52:51.380
which are valid reasons for this judicial divorce.

52:51.380 --> 52:53.139
(Judge)

52:53.139 --> 52:54.980
Defendant, do you have an attorney?

52:56.110 --> 52:57.219
No, I don't.

52:58.349 --> 53:00.489
Don't you have anything to say?

53:01.320 --> 53:03.920
Have courage and speak your mind.

53:09.530 --> 53:10.960
I love my wife.

53:11.329 --> 53:13.369
And I don't want this divorce.

53:14.030 --> 53:17.300
I will publicly announce it in the court of law.

53:17.769 --> 53:18.900
I...

53:21.239 --> 53:22.969
will end my relationship with that woman.

53:24.309 --> 53:25.639
By "that woman"...

53:25.639 --> 53:28.550
I'm talking about the woman I'm seeing besides my wife.

53:31.119 --> 53:32.449
(Lawyer, Plaintiff)

53:32.449 --> 53:34.320
It sounds like he made this decision today.

53:34.320 --> 53:36.519
That's not true. I made this decision yesterday.

53:36.519 --> 53:38.889
My decision remains unchanged.

53:38.889 --> 53:41.260
A Jin! I love you!

53:41.329 --> 53:43.699
Plaintiff, if you have anything to say, go ahead.

53:46.159 --> 53:49.769
I'm reminded of what my lawyer said about the seriousness of marriage.

53:50.400 --> 53:52.239
He said, my husband...

53:52.570 --> 53:54.570
thought of our marriage very lightly compared to me.

53:55.869 --> 53:56.980
I'd like to take...

53:57.940 --> 54:00.679
this opportunity to make one apology to my husband.

54:02.849 --> 54:04.650
I took this marriage...

54:05.280 --> 54:08.489
just as lightly as my husband did.

54:12.820 --> 54:16.730
Before we got married, he gave me a ride in a top, foreign luxury car.

54:17.530 --> 54:20.699
It was on a cold, winter day, and he put on the heater.

54:21.869 --> 54:24.639
As soon as he turned it on, I was embraced by the heat.

54:25.940 --> 54:28.969
At that moment, my husband opened the sunroof.

54:29.769 --> 54:33.139
With the heater and sunroof, it felt really comfortable.

54:33.679 --> 54:37.849
At that moment, I decided to marry him.

54:40.050 --> 54:43.590
"This man will provide me with the most comfort."

54:45.190 --> 54:47.230
That's what marriage meant to me.

54:50.360 --> 54:52.960
I finally came to realize how foolish...

54:53.730 --> 54:54.969
that decision was.

55:11.250 --> 55:13.650
I feel that the persons involved said everything they wanted to,

55:13.690 --> 55:17.090
and since the case has been tried, I will make my final ruling...

55:17.289 --> 55:18.590
without wasting any time.

55:19.219 --> 55:21.829
The divorce lawsuit filed by Woo A Jin,

55:22.429 --> 55:24.630
will be granted a divorce,

55:25.030 --> 55:26.969
just as Woo A Jin requested.

55:28.844 --> 55:31.174
Wait, what is this?

55:31.314 --> 55:33.145
You can't do this, Your Honor!

55:33.515 --> 55:34.645
Your Honor!

55:35.085 --> 55:36.754
Can't you hear me? Your Honor!

55:39.555 --> 55:40.685
Sir.

55:41.555 --> 55:42.625
Ms. Park...

55:43.924 --> 55:47.424
Sir, Ms. Park sold all of the company shares...

55:48.424 --> 55:49.995
to a private equity fund.

55:51.535 --> 55:54.305
And since then, no one has been able...

55:55.904 --> 55:57.305
to get a hold of her.

56:39.575 --> 56:41.844
I do have the vice chairwoman title, but in reality,

56:42.415 --> 56:44.154
I don't even have any shares.

56:44.154 --> 56:46.484
I've actually been thinking about making some changes.

56:47.424 --> 56:48.725
Really?

56:48.725 --> 56:50.294
Why should we even grow the business?

56:50.294 --> 56:52.654
None of your children is competent enough to inherit it.

56:53.055 --> 56:56.995
Since the company is doing so well now, you should sell it...

56:56.995 --> 56:59.134
and keep the cash.

57:10.004 --> 57:11.274
Thank you.

57:58.395 --> 57:59.924
- Hello? - Ms. Woo.

58:00.194 --> 58:02.895
Ms. Park, Mr. Chairman collapsed!

58:02.895 --> 58:04.395
Mr. Chairman has collapsed!

58:24.114 --> 58:25.984
(The Lady in Dignity)

58:25.984 --> 58:27.924
As you can all see, MK Capital is now...

58:27.924 --> 58:29.855
the majority shareholder of Daesung Pulp.

58:29.855 --> 58:31.455
She obviously did it behind Dad's back.

58:31.455 --> 58:34.094
Mr. Chairman was the one who wanted to sell the company.

58:34.194 --> 58:37.294
I told you that she needs to leave.

58:37.294 --> 58:39.265
Why didn't you listen to me?

58:39.964 --> 58:42.634
You punk, how dare you eat up the company all by yourself?

58:42.634 --> 58:43.935
Give us our shares!

58:43.935 --> 58:45.475
Why are you guys doing this to me?

58:45.475 --> 58:48.205
Tell me where Park Bok Ja is. Isn't that where you're going?

58:48.205 --> 58:49.544
How much is she giving you?

58:49.674 --> 58:51.015
What a bat.

58:51.944 --> 58:55.145
I'll give your husband back to you, so give me back my paintings.

58:55.145 --> 58:56.785
What do you think you're doing now?

58:56.785 --> 58:59.515
Just live happily ever after with Ahn Jae Seok...

58:59.515 --> 59:01.254
and keep painting.

59:01.285 --> 59:02.955
- What? - We'll give you exactly 15 days.

59:02.955 --> 59:05.355
If you don't move out by then, we'll disseminate these photos.

59:05.355 --> 59:07.464
Don't try any tricks with me.

59:07.564 --> 59:09.564
You know we're in the same boat.

59:09.625 --> 59:11.395
Do you want to get the company back?

59:11.765 --> 59:14.605
What if they're seeing each other? A Jin wouldn't do that.

59:14.605 --> 59:16.805
You never know what can happen between a man and a woman.

59:16.805 --> 59:18.174
What should I do now?

59:18.535 --> 59:21.544
I tracked the location of her cell phone. What should I do?

59:21.774 --> 59:24.145
Let's kill her. We have to kill her.

59:24.314 --> 59:25.975
That's the only way.
