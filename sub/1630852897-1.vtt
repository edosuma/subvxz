00:11.317 --> 00:13.907
<i>Oh, my God,
you're, like, coughing.</i>

00:13.949 --> 00:15.579
- <i>I actually like it.</i>
- <i>Yeah, I like it.</i>

00:15.621 --> 00:17.884
<i>This is an
announcement about Picture Day.</i>

00:17.926 --> 00:20.085
<i>Freshmen class portraits
at 9:30.</i>

00:20.127 --> 00:22.448
<i>Sophomore class portraits
at 10:30.</i>

00:22.490 --> 00:24.527
<i>Juniors will be during lunch.</i>

00:25.798 --> 00:27.187
That wasn't hard.

00:27.229 --> 00:28.395
Shut up, bitch.

00:28.437 --> 00:29.794
You shut up.

00:29.836 --> 00:30.896
Feel like a man.

00:30.938 --> 00:32.228
Like a giant.

00:32.270 --> 00:33.734
Cherry bomb!

00:55.287 --> 00:56.295
Comb?

00:57.456 --> 01:00.398
Mirror? Comb? No?

01:02.569 --> 01:03.764
Mirror?

01:04.900 --> 01:05.863
Comb?

01:05.905 --> 01:07.534
- Bonzai!
- Oh!

01:07.576 --> 01:09.242
Fuck off, asshole.

01:10.505 --> 01:12.245
- Ugh!
- I'll take it.

01:22.152 --> 01:23.487
So what's your name?

01:26.519 --> 01:28.787
Talkative. I like that.

01:28.829 --> 01:30.087
How's your day going?

01:30.597 --> 01:31.624
Yeah.

01:31.666 --> 01:32.925
Dinner tonight?

01:34.263 --> 01:36.330
Are you asking me out?

01:36.372 --> 01:37.592
Yes.

01:37.634 --> 01:39.592
I'm not going on a date
with you. You're 12.

01:39.634 --> 01:41.601
You're funny. I'm 15.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.034
How old are you?

01:43.803 --> 01:45.469
You're not supposed
to ask that.

01:45.511 --> 01:47.935
You're not supposed to ask
a girl how old she is.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.470
Annoying.

01:49.512 --> 01:51.944
You're right,
it doesn't matter to me.

01:53.813 --> 01:55.907
How are you
gonna pay for dinner?

01:55.949 --> 01:57.816
If I say yes and we go
on a date for dinner,

01:57.858 --> 01:58.985
how are you gonna pay?

01:59.027 --> 02:01.682
You say everything twice.

02:01.724 --> 02:03.419
- I don't say everything twice.
- You do. You do.

02:03.461 --> 02:05.430
What is this,
"Say everything twice"?

02:06.330 --> 02:08.532
Come on. How are you gonna pay?

02:10.562 --> 02:11.963
Do you go to the movies?

02:12.005 --> 02:13.965
Of course I go to the movies.

02:14.007 --> 02:15.737
Did you see <i>Under One Roof?</i>

02:16.368 --> 02:17.376
Yeah.

02:18.175 --> 02:20.371
You're looking at Tony.

02:20.413 --> 02:21.939
There's, like,
a million kids in that movie.

02:21.981 --> 02:24.210
I don't know a Tony.

02:24.252 --> 02:26.174
I want you to have dinner
with me, not my work.

02:26.216 --> 02:27.345
I'm not trying to brag,

02:27.387 --> 02:29.347
but you did ask how I was
gonna pay for dinner.

02:29.389 --> 02:33.644
You're such an actor.
You're such an actor.

02:33.686 --> 02:35.152
What else have you been in?

02:35.194 --> 02:36.814
- <i>This House is Haunted.</i>
- No.

02:36.856 --> 02:39.390
- <i>Two Beds, Two Baths.</i>
- Mmm-mmm.

02:39.432 --> 02:41.355
I've done three sketches
on <i>The Merv Griffin Show.</i>

02:41.397 --> 02:42.493
Did you ever see me on the...

02:42.535 --> 02:44.330
All right. Don't list your
whole resume, it's braggy.

02:44.372 --> 02:47.159
I'm not going on a date
with you, man. You're 15.

02:47.201 --> 02:48.198
"Man."

02:49.402 --> 02:50.706
I like that.

02:52.275 --> 02:53.537
"Kid," how about that?

02:53.579 --> 02:56.669
I'm not going on a date
with you, "kid." You're 15.

02:56.711 --> 02:59.570
Don't call it a date.
It's not a date.

02:59.612 --> 03:01.044
Just come say hello.

03:01.086 --> 03:02.345
I like the way you look.

03:02.387 --> 03:04.376
I like talking with you.

03:04.418 --> 03:05.708
Where do you live?

03:05.750 --> 03:06.878
Encino.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.853
Encino? I live in Encino.
Where in Encino?

03:09.895 --> 03:10.914
On Hatteras.

03:10.956 --> 03:13.016
- Hatteras and what?
- Ugh. Creep.

03:13.058 --> 03:14.822
"Hatteras and what?
Hatteras and what?"

03:14.864 --> 03:16.322
I'm not telling you where
I live, creep. Come on.

03:16.364 --> 03:18.493
- I'll be at the Tail o' the Cock tonight.
- I don't care where you'll be.

03:18.535 --> 03:19.696
I go there every Thursday
for dinner.

03:19.738 --> 03:21.201
I don't care where you eat.
Wait, where are your parents

03:21.243 --> 03:22.562
- while all this is happening?
- They're working.

03:22.604 --> 03:25.037
They're working.
Just come say hi.

03:25.638 --> 03:26.973
Just shut up.

03:28.281 --> 03:29.771
I'll tell you
what I'm doing.

03:29.813 --> 03:32.878
I take my brother Greg
to Tastee-Freez around 6:30,

03:32.920 --> 03:34.340
he's in bed by 7:30.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.739
Wait, you go all the way from Encino
to Tail o' the Cock for dinner?

03:36.781 --> 03:37.947
I live in Sherman Oaks.

03:37.989 --> 03:39.110
Oh, come on.

03:39.152 --> 03:41.579
I take my brother Greg
to Tastee-Freez around 6:30,

03:41.621 --> 03:42.918
he's in bed by 7:30.

03:42.960 --> 03:45.088
I slip around the corner to
Tail o' the Cock for my dinner.

03:45.130 --> 03:46.685
That's where I'll be.

03:46.727 --> 03:47.761
I'm not trying to pressure you.

03:47.803 --> 03:49.226
You are pressuring me.

03:49.268 --> 03:50.392
You are.
That's what you're doing.

03:50.434 --> 03:51.592
If you wanna come
and say hello,

03:51.634 --> 03:52.856
if it's convenient
within your plans,

03:52.898 --> 03:54.263
I'd love to see you.

03:54.305 --> 03:56.293
"Convenient within my plans"?

03:56.335 --> 03:58.533
Wait, you leave your brother alone?
How old is he?

03:58.575 --> 04:00.974
He's eight. He's nine.

04:02.245 --> 04:03.474
You're hilarious.

04:03.516 --> 04:05.940
You can't even keep
your own stories straight.

04:05.982 --> 04:08.071
What are you? You're like a little...

04:08.113 --> 04:10.776
Robert Goulet,
Dean Martin or something.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.785
- Where do you come from?
- Sherman Oaks.

04:12.827 --> 04:14.526
Ha! Sherman Oaks.

04:15.658 --> 04:17.421
- Hi, Alana.
- Hi, Cindy.

04:17.463 --> 04:19.791
Did you know we got
a big movie star here?

04:19.834 --> 04:21.652
Gary Valentine.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.469
Your name is Valentine?

04:24.365 --> 04:25.461
Valentine.

04:25.503 --> 04:26.623
Should I get
an autograph?

04:26.665 --> 04:28.034
Don't bother.

04:29.177 --> 04:30.337
I've been right here
the whole time.

04:30.379 --> 04:32.564
I get this feeling I was meant
to know you, Alana.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.770
You know I'm 25, right?

04:34.812 --> 04:36.974
I can be your friend
but I can't be your girlfriend.

04:37.016 --> 04:38.076
That's illegal.

04:38.118 --> 04:40.003
- You give me hope.
- Shut up.

04:40.045 --> 04:41.345
This is fate
that brought us together.

04:41.387 --> 04:42.945
- This is fate.
- Shut up.

04:42.987 --> 04:44.116
Card.

04:46.118 --> 04:47.450
- Right here. Okay.
- I mean, I'm trying

04:47.492 --> 04:48.649
- to spend my time with you.
- Oi, oi.

04:48.691 --> 04:49.988
- Is that bad?
- Stop, stop that. Oi.

04:50.030 --> 04:51.048
Turn your legs around.

04:51.090 --> 04:53.819
Not too down,
so look up, look up. Uh...

04:53.861 --> 04:55.523
Close your mouth
just a little bit.

04:55.565 --> 04:56.625
Just see a little bit of teeth.

04:56.667 --> 04:57.691
Little bit of teeth.
Little bit of teeth.

04:57.733 --> 05:00.194
Go on, like a tiger.
Off it. Go.

05:00.236 --> 05:01.996
Next. Next.

05:02.038 --> 05:04.533
How have I never seen you before?
How have we never met?

05:04.575 --> 05:06.832
Stop talking
so much, slimy.

05:06.874 --> 05:10.435
We'll see.
I doubt it, but we'll see.

05:10.477 --> 05:13.041
Now I gotta get back to work and
you have to get back to class.

05:13.083 --> 05:15.678
Stop using time as an excuse, Alana.
Our roads took us here.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.217
Stop sounding
like a philosophy guy,

05:17.259 --> 05:20.151
Albert Einstein.
Maybe I'll see you later.

05:20.193 --> 05:22.187
I'm not gonna see you later.

05:27.098 --> 05:29.621
Put your chin up
just a little bit like that, Laura.

05:31.037 --> 05:32.032
Chin up, chin up.

05:37.609 --> 05:38.874
- Hey, Gary. Hey, Greg.
- Hey.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.409
I met the girl
I'm gonna marry one day, Greg.

05:51.451 --> 05:52.624
Oh, yeah?

05:53.558 --> 05:55.286
And you're gonna be
my best man.

06:13.715 --> 06:16.241
<i>So,
two down and Garvey the batter.</i>

06:19.280 --> 06:21.045
I'll be at the Tail
o' the Cock if you need me.

06:21.087 --> 06:22.244
Love you, Greggo.

06:22.286 --> 06:23.380
Love you, too.

06:25.959 --> 06:30.182
<i>Steve finished the
regular season with 111 RBIs,</i>

06:30.224 --> 06:33.923
<i>three more than Jimmy Wynn.</i>

06:33.965 --> 06:36.890
<i>Sixth inning with the Dodgers
leading two to nothing.</i>

06:36.932 --> 06:39.399
<i>Two runs, three hits,
and no errors.</i>

06:39.441 --> 06:42.265
<i>Remember, there are
still tickets available</i>

06:42.307 --> 06:43.695
<i>for Tuesday's game.</i>

06:43.737 --> 06:44.932
<i>You can get them today</i>

06:44.974 --> 06:47.765
<i>at the Dodgers ticket office
on Stadium Way.</i>

06:50.109 --> 06:52.112
<i>And the pitch is high,
ball one.</i>

06:57.454 --> 06:59.086
Don't be creepy, please.

07:12.198 --> 07:13.431
<i>Foul ball
up the middle.</i>

07:13.473 --> 07:15.465
Will you stop
with the googly eyes?

07:20.212 --> 07:21.713
Excuse me, Don.

07:22.314 --> 07:23.604
Can I have two Cokes?

07:23.646 --> 07:25.075
Sure, Gary, you got it.

07:25.117 --> 07:26.113
Thank you.

07:35.555 --> 07:36.563
Stop.

07:36.831 --> 07:38.354
What?

07:38.396 --> 07:39.995
I can hear you breathing.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.032
Stop.

07:46.074 --> 07:47.673
- Breathing?
- Yes.

08:02.686 --> 08:05.592
So, Alana, what are your plans?

08:09.261 --> 08:11.014
I don't know.

08:11.056 --> 08:12.830
What's your future look like?

08:13.694 --> 08:15.054
I don't know.

08:15.096 --> 08:16.834
How do you like working
at Tiny Toes?

08:17.535 --> 08:19.860
I hate working at Tiny Toes.

08:19.902 --> 08:21.165
You should start
your own business.

08:23.706 --> 08:25.403
What business should I be in?

08:25.445 --> 08:27.006
I don't know.
What do you like?

08:27.048 --> 08:28.639
I don't know.

08:28.681 --> 08:31.635
You're an actress.
You should be an actress.

08:35.347 --> 08:38.049
So how'd you become
such a hotshot actor?

08:38.092 --> 08:39.515
I'm a showman.

08:39.557 --> 08:40.881
- It's my calling.
- Ugh.

08:40.923 --> 08:42.078
I don't know how
to do anything else.

08:42.120 --> 08:43.346
It's what I'm meant to do.

08:43.388 --> 08:44.752
I mean, ever since
I was a kid, I've been

08:44.794 --> 08:46.555
- a song and dance man.
- Come on.

08:46.597 --> 08:48.360
Ever since you were a kid?

08:48.402 --> 08:50.558
Song and dance man?

08:50.600 --> 08:52.191
Where are your parents?

08:52.233 --> 08:53.762
- My mom works for me.
- Oh, of course she does.

08:53.804 --> 08:54.861
- Yes, she does.
- That makes sense.

08:54.903 --> 08:55.929
In my public relations company.

08:55.971 --> 08:58.601
In your
public relations company?

08:58.643 --> 09:00.097
- Because you have that?
- Yes.

09:00.139 --> 09:01.834
- And you're an actor.
- Yes.

09:01.876 --> 09:03.206
And you're a secret agent too?

09:04.419 --> 09:06.069
Well, no,
I'm not a secret agent.

09:06.111 --> 09:07.412
That's funny.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.317
Are you joking?

09:12.720 --> 09:14.584
Well, no, I'm not.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.253
That's a lot.

09:16.295 --> 09:17.714
Gets complicated.

09:17.756 --> 09:19.452
I'm sure.

09:19.494 --> 09:21.591
And all that math homework you
have to do after everything.

09:23.470 --> 09:24.793
My mom's in Las Vegas right now

09:24.835 --> 09:26.793
taking care of
the Hacienda Hotel,

09:26.835 --> 09:28.568
which leaves me back here.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.366
We do PR for Tail o'
the Cock and Chadney's.

09:30.408 --> 09:31.435
I like Chadney's.

09:31.477 --> 09:32.634
- You like Chadney's?
- Yeah.

09:32.676 --> 09:34.473
Do you like Japanese food?

09:34.515 --> 09:36.206
I don't really know
what that is.

09:36.248 --> 09:38.038
The Mikado?

09:38.080 --> 09:40.045
I'm taking you to The Mikado
next time.

09:40.087 --> 09:41.246
Next time?

09:41.288 --> 09:42.788
Yeah.

09:43.620 --> 09:45.252
The food's magnificent.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.125
You're sweet, Gary.

09:55.298 --> 09:59.101
You're gonna be rich in a
mansion by the time you're 16.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.162
I'm gonna be here

10:01.204 --> 10:04.810
taking photos of kids for
their yearbooks when I'm 30.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.011
You're never gonna remember me.

10:09.316 --> 10:11.146
I'm not gonna forget you.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.380
Just like you're not
gonna forget me.

10:33.501 --> 10:36.601
If I ask for your phone number,
would you give it to me?

10:36.643 --> 10:39.362
Why should I give you
my phone number?

10:39.404 --> 10:41.308
So I can call you.

10:43.208 --> 10:44.801
I don't know, Gary.

10:44.843 --> 10:45.851
Why not?

10:46.915 --> 10:48.544
How are you gonna remember it?

10:48.586 --> 10:50.317
It's only seven numbers.

10:55.524 --> 10:58.315
758-4686.

10:58.357 --> 11:01.097
- 756-4686.
- You already got it wrong.

11:02.432 --> 11:04.661
758-4686.

11:05.867 --> 11:07.334
All right, Don Rickles.

11:10.941 --> 11:13.631
Don't call me
all the time. Okay?

11:13.673 --> 11:16.541
We're not boyfriend and girlfriend.
Remember that.

11:18.747 --> 11:20.380
We're... You know.

11:21.748 --> 11:22.888
I know.

11:38.464 --> 11:39.892
- Hi, Dad.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

11:39.934 --> 11:41.397
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:41.439 --> 11:42.734
What's up?

11:42.776 --> 11:44.305
- What?
- What's going on?

11:45.444 --> 11:46.702
Nothing.

11:46.744 --> 11:48.064
What time is it now?

11:48.106 --> 11:49.112
10:00.

11:50.208 --> 11:51.701
What'd you do?

11:51.743 --> 11:53.442
I told you what I was
gonna do this morning.

11:53.484 --> 11:54.546
What?

11:54.588 --> 11:55.712
Go to dinner with Lisa.

11:55.754 --> 11:56.844
- Lisa?
- Yeah.

11:56.886 --> 11:58.274
Who the fuck is Lisa?

11:58.316 --> 11:59.910
Dad, you know Lisa.

11:59.952 --> 12:01.014
Lisa?

12:01.056 --> 12:02.182
Yeah, she works with me

12:02.224 --> 12:03.245
- at Tiny Toes.
- I don't know Lisa.

12:03.287 --> 12:04.930
- What?
- Yes.

12:18.477 --> 12:19.938
Where were you?

12:19.980 --> 12:22.639
Why are you dressed like that?
Were you on a date?

12:22.681 --> 12:23.940
Looks like it was a long date.

12:23.982 --> 12:25.704
Get out of my room, Este.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.650
<i>"His name is
Jerome H. Frick.</i>

12:31.692 --> 12:33.917
His friends know him
simply as Jerry,

12:33.959 --> 12:36.752
and his attractive
young wife as Mioko.

12:36.794 --> 12:38.318
Their new restaurant Mikado

12:38.360 --> 12:41.318
is a delightful dinery
featuring foods of Japan,

12:41.360 --> 12:42.961
and it should be
quite authentic,

12:43.003 --> 12:46.463
for Jerry had a restaurant
some 15 years in Tokyo.

12:46.505 --> 12:47.733
The entire staff,

12:47.775 --> 12:50.427
with the exception of Jerry,
is Japanese,

12:50.469 --> 12:52.771
and those 'little doll'
waitresses

12:52.813 --> 12:55.604
are dressed fittingly
in colorful kimonos.

12:55.646 --> 12:56.805
Give it a try,

12:56.847 --> 12:59.275
we think you'll be delighted."

12:59.317 --> 13:02.578
- Oh, that's wonderful, Anita.
- Oh, fantastic.

13:02.620 --> 13:03.649
Oh, of course.

13:03.691 --> 13:05.409
- It's just wonderful.
- Oh.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.684
- Thank you.
- Of course.

13:06.726 --> 13:08.413
Uh, do you think
we should mention

13:08.455 --> 13:09.952
something about
the serenity, though?

13:09.994 --> 13:12.651
- Hmm.
- The pleasant quiet?

13:12.693 --> 13:15.420
Yes, and I wish that we had
space to include everything

13:15.462 --> 13:16.990
because it's such
a beautiful restaurant,

13:17.032 --> 13:19.367
but if we choose one thing...

13:20.573 --> 13:21.763
Right.

13:21.805 --> 13:24.197
Okay. Let's just...

13:24.239 --> 13:26.768
Oh, Mioko,

13:26.810 --> 13:28.532
how you think of this?

13:28.574 --> 13:31.511
What do you think of item
for newspaper?

13:42.154 --> 13:45.261
Oh, oh, Yoko-san.

13:46.998 --> 13:48.384
I think the cuisine
is not mentioned.

13:48.426 --> 13:49.495
- Oh.
- She's wondering

13:49.537 --> 13:50.891
if we mentioned the cuisine.

13:50.933 --> 13:52.457
Of co... Uh...

13:52.499 --> 13:54.492
- The cuisine?
- Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.532
I think we did talk about that,
didn't we?

13:56.574 --> 13:57.462
I might...

13:57.504 --> 13:59.572
I have an earlier draft.

14:01.414 --> 14:02.636
Here it is.

14:02.678 --> 14:05.976
"There is a complete roster of
Japanese appetizers available

14:06.018 --> 14:08.978
while sipping American
or Japanese spirits.

14:09.020 --> 14:11.181
For the daring,
sashimi is offered.

14:11.223 --> 14:14.085
But don't worry, there are
many American dishes too.

14:14.127 --> 14:18.749
Mikado is for the gourmet
and the non-gourmet alike."

14:18.791 --> 14:20.690
What you think of that?

14:25.137 --> 14:27.490
Much better
talking about the cuisine

14:27.532 --> 14:28.724
than the waitresses. Thank you.

14:28.766 --> 14:31.102
Oh, fantastic.
I will make a note of that.

14:31.144 --> 14:34.267
- Sure.
- That's what we'll send to the paper.

14:34.309 --> 14:35.740
Thank you so much

14:35.782 --> 14:37.235
for coming in to
G and G Agency.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.711
Really appreciate it, Anita.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.009
- Thank you so much.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:40.051 --> 14:41.546
- <i>Arigato.</i>
- Of course.

14:41.588 --> 14:43.319
Oh... Oh!

14:44.253 --> 14:45.547
<i>7:20
with Charlie Tuna.</i>

14:45.589 --> 14:47.852
<i>I'll make that call to the
girl selected by a computer...</i>

14:47.894 --> 14:49.513
- So...
- <i>...as the most</i>

14:49.555 --> 14:52.022
<i>compatible mate for me
in one minute.</i>

14:52.064 --> 14:54.356
I'm afraid you're gonna be
upset with me.

14:54.398 --> 14:57.530
I can't take you to New York
for <i>The Jerry Best Show.</i>

14:57.572 --> 14:59.963
I have to go to Las Vegas.

15:00.005 --> 15:01.060
<i>Delicious Certs.</i>

15:01.102 --> 15:02.358
- I'm not upset.
- No?

15:02.400 --> 15:04.199
No. Why is that bad?

15:04.241 --> 15:06.271
<i>It's two mints in one...</i>

15:06.313 --> 15:09.473
Well, you can't go to New York
without a parent or a guardian.

15:09.515 --> 15:12.249
They're not gonna let you do the
press tour without a chaperone.

15:25.265 --> 15:28.085
The Salisbury steak is delicious.
How's the chicken?

15:28.127 --> 15:30.390
Delicious.

15:42.615 --> 15:45.777
Excuse me, sir,
could I offer you another beverage?

15:46.377 --> 15:47.437
I beg your pardon?

15:48.548 --> 15:50.581
Can I get you
something else to drink?

15:50.623 --> 15:51.816
What's your name?

15:52.724 --> 15:53.848
Um, it's Brenda.

15:53.890 --> 15:55.413
- Brenda.
- Mmm-hmm.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.787
That's a beautiful name.

15:56.829 --> 15:58.591
Um...

15:58.633 --> 16:00.297
I'll take two Cokes, Brenda.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.134
Okay.

16:05.167 --> 16:06.963
Are you one of the actors?

16:07.639 --> 16:08.701
Yes, I am.

16:18.814 --> 16:19.811
<i>Hola.</i>

16:21.653 --> 16:23.209
<i>Como esta?</i>

16:23.251 --> 16:25.256
- I'm Lance.
- Hi.

16:26.157 --> 16:28.312
- <i>Me llamo</i> Alana.
- Alana.

16:28.354 --> 16:30.546
<i>Bien. Bien.</i>

16:30.588 --> 16:32.217
- Hey, Gar.
- Lance.

16:32.259 --> 16:33.782
How's things back here?

16:33.824 --> 16:35.287
- Pretty smooth ride, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

16:35.329 --> 16:36.663
Never flown this bird before.

16:39.168 --> 16:40.290
What'd you have for lunch?

16:40.332 --> 16:41.566
Salisbury steak.

16:41.608 --> 16:43.463
I had the chicken.

16:43.505 --> 16:45.936
They did have steak back here?
Good, good.

16:47.940 --> 16:50.676
All right. Well, hey,
very nice to meet you, Alana.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.349
I'll see you on the tarmac.

16:52.850 --> 16:54.010
Charmed.

16:59.521 --> 17:03.087
Wow, super-hot chaperone, Gar.
Nice one.

17:03.129 --> 17:04.748
That's my friend,
don't think about that.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.585
Oh, man, are you kidding?
My mind's racing,

17:06.627 --> 17:08.252
doing circles around
that track.

17:11.362 --> 17:12.489
Hello, boys.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.665
- Hey, Lucy.
- Hi, Lucy.

- Hey, Lance.

17:25.217 --> 17:28.873
And, Valentine, don't.
Just don't in here.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.778
What's that? What is that? V?
Is that for "vagina"?

17:31.820 --> 17:34.114
Why are you doing that?
Why do people keep doing that?

17:34.156 --> 17:35.281
Peace and love, baby.

17:35.323 --> 17:36.583
Oh, shut it, you little shit.

17:36.625 --> 17:38.922
Now, cut the comedy.
Don't be an ass out there.

17:38.964 --> 17:41.127
Good show, everybody.

17:41.169 --> 17:42.927
- Thank you, Lucy.
- Thank you, Lucy.

17:44.172 --> 17:47.527
Sweetheart, do not embarrass
Mommy, okay? Have fun.

17:47.569 --> 17:49.571
Break legs.

17:52.003 --> 17:53.871
Watch for me on stage.
I'll send you a signal.

17:53.913 --> 17:55.038
I'll make a joke just for you.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.875
- Okay.
- Straight ahead.

17:56.917 --> 17:58.308
She's not
even stopping.

17:58.350 --> 18:00.318
Keep going straight ahead
to the stage.

18:01.688 --> 18:03.072
To the right.

18:08.859 --> 18:12.322
Lucy, I wanna tell you how much
we enjoyed your visit tonight.

18:12.364 --> 18:14.892
Before you go,
I'd like the audience to meet

18:14.934 --> 18:16.627
those wonderful 18 children...

18:16.669 --> 18:17.722
Wonderful.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.423
...who played the kids in
<i>Under One Roof.</i>

18:19.465 --> 18:20.557
I think they'd like that.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.095

- Yes.

18:22.137 --> 18:24.233

Lance, how's things
in Hollywood for you?

20:01.966 --> 20:03.361
Oh, things are going
real well, Jerry.

20:03.403 --> 20:06.370
I just did a guest spot on <i>Banacek</i>
with George Peppard for NBC.

20:06.412 --> 20:08.007
George Peppard.
That's great, that's great.

20:08.049 --> 20:09.371
- Thank you.
- How about you, Gary?

20:09.413 --> 20:11.667
Well, last week
I did Three Beavers.

20:11.709 --> 20:12.978
<i>Leave it to Beaver?</i>

20:13.655 --> 20:15.208
Three Beavers.

20:17.652 --> 20:18.710
Hi, what's your name?

20:18.752 --> 20:20.119
Thank you
for asking, Jerry.

20:20.161 --> 20:21.380
- Boo.
- My name is Margo.

20:21.422 --> 20:22.513
Hi, Margo.

20:24.562 --> 20:26.290
- Oh, there you are, my...
- You little shit!

20:26.332 --> 20:27.953
- You little prick.
- What'd I do?

20:27.995 --> 20:31.024
You think you're funny, huh?
You think you're funny?

20:31.066 --> 20:33.296
- Humiliating me in front of millions.
- Lucy! Wait.

20:33.338 --> 20:35.197
- Let me go.
- These are my fans.

20:35.239 --> 20:37.027
You cannot treat me like this.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.939
This is the end for you.
I'm coming to get you.

20:41.081 --> 20:42.473
Oh, baby, are you okay?

20:42.515 --> 20:44.041
- She didn't seem too happy.
- Are you okay?

20:44.083 --> 20:45.273
- No.
- It's okay.

20:45.315 --> 20:46.375
Is she like that all the time?

20:46.417 --> 20:48.208
More or less, yeah.

20:48.250 --> 20:49.421
How are you doing?

20:49.922 --> 20:52.416
- Good.
- Good.

20:52.458 --> 20:54.710
All right, I should go
get out of these pajamas.

20:54.752 --> 20:56.049
- Okay.
- I'll see you.

20:56.091 --> 20:57.088
Bye.

21:25.049 --> 21:26.349
- Thank you, William.
- Thanks, Vic.

21:26.391 --> 21:28.015
Right down the stairs,
young man.

21:28.057 --> 21:29.054
Gary?

21:29.655 --> 21:30.683
- Gary Valentine.
- Vic.

21:30.725 --> 21:31.781
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

21:31.823 --> 21:33.353
What've you been up to, man?

21:33.395 --> 21:35.688
I was in New York on a PR trip for
<i>Under One Roof. The Jerry Best Show.</i>

Sorry.
Can I do it one more time?

22:46.304 --> 22:48.067
- Sure.
- "My fa..."

22:49.775 --> 22:52.762
"My face is a pimply mess

Oh, wow, thank you. Uh,

27:33.927 --> 27:36.685
however, I must respectfully refuse.
I'm an atheist.

27:46.933 --> 27:48.268
You're Jewish.

27:49.332 --> 27:51.335
Well, you're certainly right.

27:51.377 --> 27:53.165
I was born into Judaism,

27:53.207 --> 27:56.972
but my personal path
has led me to atheism.

27:57.014 --> 27:58.500
You see, I just can't believe
there's a God

27:58.542 --> 28:00.409

the world.

28:00.451 --> 28:02.337
Vietnam, you know?

28:02.379 --> 28:05.077

no, sir.

28:24.543 --> 28:27.241
Like a regular penis, I guess.

28:28.413 --> 28:29.980
Is it circumcised?

28:31.414 --> 28:32.477
Yeah.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.711
Then you're a fucking Jew!

28:38.484 --> 28:40.717
Why would you do that?
Why would you do that?

28:40.759 --> 28:42.254
He was maybe gonna be
my boyfriend.

28:43.391 --> 28:45.283
you don't bring this idiot
to Shabbat dinner here.

28:45.325 --> 28:47.559
Listen, Dad,
he's an atheist, and an actor,

28:47.601 --> 28:49.088
- and he's famous.
- But he's Jewish.

28:49.130 --> 28:50.286
He was gonna take me
out of here.

28:50.328 --> 28:51.891

- You're always looking at me.
- No.

28:54.237 --> 28:55.867
- I didn't even say anything.
- What are you doing?

28:55.909 --> 28:57.593

33:33.120 --> 33:35.507
- Hey, Gary. Gary. Hey.
- Just guess the amount of...

33:35.549 --> 33:36.906
I think I know where
I can find some LSD.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.411
Do you think that would be
better than the weed?

33:38.453 --> 33:40.074
No, no, no. Keep it
with the grass, man.

33:40.116 --> 33:41.685
- Keep it with the grass.
- All right. Okay, sounds good.

33:41.727 --> 33:42.754
Keep it with the grass.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.480
Have you guys
ever been to the ocean?

33:45.522 --> 33:46.819
- Yeah, why?
- Sure.

33:46.861 --> 33:50.025
You remember that relaxing feeling
of just laying on the water?

33:50.067 --> 33:51.393
- Laying on the water?
- Yeah.

33:51.435 --> 33:53.798
Have that every night
with a Soggy Bottom waterbed.

33:55.037 --> 33:56.597

Hello, handsome.

No, 'cause I'm not a teenager.

34:25.797 --> 34:27.996
I'm selling earrings

Having trouble sleeping?

Oh, hi, Kiki.

35:06.639 --> 35:08.732
Hey, Alana.
What are you doing here?

35:08.774 --> 35:11.104
Seeing this
little David Cassidy.

35:11.146 --> 35:12.171
What are you doing here?

35:12.213 --> 35:13.548
I'm working for him.

35:14.281 --> 35:15.649
Is that so?

35:16.888 --> 35:18.678
So, how many dots is it?

35:18.720 --> 35:20.751
Who knows? I don't think
they even counted.

35:20.793 --> 35:22.179
- Hey!
- Whoa!

35:22.221 --> 35:23.418
Whoa. Whoa.

35:30.562 --> 35:31.688
No, Gary! No! No! Gary!

- He has rights!
- Officer, what did I do?

35:39.576 --> 35:41.271
- What are your badge numbers?
- Officer, what did I do?

35:41.313 --> 35:42.472
- I will be reporting you...
- What did I do?

35:42.514 --> 35:44.645
...to the chief of police
immediately when I get outside.

35:45.311 --> 35:46.416
Where's he going?

35:47.346 --> 35:48.375
Gary, don't worry.

35:48.417 --> 35:49.779
Don't worry.
I'm gonna find you, okay?

I threw it out.

39:39.278 --> 39:42.817
Hey, "Soggy Bottom" sounds
like someone shit their pants.

39:46.651 --> 39:48.019
I know, I know.

39:48.061 --> 39:49.989
- That's not good.
- I know.

39:51.097 --> 39:52.454
That's only funny to you guys.

39:52.496 --> 39:53.789
But when someone wants
to buy a bed,

39:53.831 --> 39:56.124
they don't wanna think about
shitting or shitty diapers,

39:56.166 --> 39:58.087
or shit in pants.

39:58.129 --> 40:00.590
Well, the bed's not just
for sleeping, Alana.

40:00.632 --> 40:03.963
Well, if it's not just for sleeping,
I think you mean it's for sex.

40:04.005 --> 40:06.465
"Soggy Bottom" isn't making
anyone hot or horny.

40:06.507 --> 40:07.842

how much was the change?

42:56.881 --> 42:58.642
Wait, I think there
might have been 19 there.

No, we have 21.

No, we only had 19.

Good to see you. How you doing?

- Good to see you, my friend.
- Good to see you.

- Business partner.

44:07.582 --> 44:08.643
Nice to meet you.

44:10.590 --> 44:11.877
Jerry, I want to talk
to you about this,

44:11.919 --> 44:13.044
- by the way.
- Hold up, hold up.

44:13.086 --> 44:15.212
Let's do it right.
Let's sit down

44:15.254 --> 44:17.552
and have something
to drink first, okay?

44:17.594 --> 44:18.653
- Sounds great.
- After you.

44:18.695 --> 44:20.226
Thank you, Jerry.

44:23.266 --> 44:27.997
Oh, Gary, I love you,
and I wanna do anything for you.

44:28.039 --> 44:30.959
But I just don't really think
these fit in my restaurant.

44:31.001 --> 44:32.066
We're Japanese,

44:32.108 --> 44:36.067
and this waterbed business
is strictly American.

44:36.109 --> 44:37.408
Uh, Kimiko,

44:37.450 --> 44:39.784
what you think
of this waterbed?

44:44.784 --> 44:45.922
Mmm-hmm.

44:46.688 --> 44:48.542
What did she just say?

44:48.584 --> 44:51.046
It's hard to tell,
I don't speak Japanese.

44:51.088 --> 44:52.318
Gary, I wanna help,

44:52.360 --> 44:56.031
but can I help without putting
these out inside everywhere?

45:05.134 --> 45:06.701
Oh, hey, Alana.

45:07.972 --> 45:09.143
Hey, Frisbee.

45:10.810 --> 45:11.938
You work here?

45:11.980 --> 45:14.643
Unfortunately.
What are you doing?

45:15.722 --> 45:18.338
Helping my friend
with his waterbed business.

45:18.380 --> 45:20.075
- Gary?
- Yeah. You know him?

45:20.117 --> 45:21.551
Yeah, I love that kid.

45:22.823 --> 45:24.323
- You love him?
- Uh-huh.

45:24.990 --> 45:26.087
How do you know him?

45:26.129 --> 45:28.586
He's in here all the time.
He's a friend of Jerry's.

45:28.628 --> 45:29.856
Yeah.

45:29.898 --> 45:31.396
He's cute for a little hustler.

45:33.498 --> 45:36.299
He's also really smart
and a good businessman.

45:36.341 --> 45:38.096
Mmm-hmm.

45:38.138 --> 45:39.976
Hey, you still work
at Tiny Toes?

45:40.942 --> 45:43.144
No, I'm partners with Gary now.

45:43.844 --> 45:46.345
Oh, the "Hand Man."

45:48.248 --> 45:50.080
Did he try and get
a hand job from you?

45:51.524 --> 45:53.882
Yeah, he's asking all the time.

45:53.924 --> 45:56.322
Good. I'll pass
the baton off to you.

46:01.194 --> 46:03.154
Okay, I'll see you
later, Frisbee.

46:03.196 --> 46:05.992
Okay. Say hi
to your sisters for me.

46:16.712 --> 46:22.005
I could describe the sensation
as a soft, spongy, slow-motion trampoline

46:22.047 --> 46:23.146
without the great bounce.

46:23.188 --> 46:24.513
Sexier.

46:24.555 --> 46:25.682
Sexier. Make it sexier.

46:25.724 --> 46:26.782
<i>But there's no...</i>

46:26.824 --> 46:27.849
- Shut up.
- <i>I can't...</i>

46:27.891 --> 46:30.014
<i>There's no floor model
for me to try?</i>

46:30.056 --> 46:31.484
No, but you can get the bed

46:31.526 --> 46:33.347
and if you don't like it,
we can do a money-back guarantee.

46:33.389 --> 46:34.749
Alana, you have to be sexier

46:34.791 --> 46:36.260
- or he's not gonna buy it.
- <i>I think I just wanna</i>

46:36.302 --> 46:37.089
<i>think about it for a while,
then maybe I'll give you a call back.</i>

46:37.131 --> 46:38.328
Don't let him
get off the phone.

46:38.370 --> 46:39.592
What's your name?

46:39.634 --> 46:40.795
<i>Uh, Ted.</i>

46:41.635 --> 46:42.693
Ted.

46:42.735 --> 46:43.863
<i>Yes.</i>

46:43.905 --> 46:46.370
Oh, Ted, I love that name.

46:46.412 --> 46:47.406
<i>Okay...</i>

46:47.907 --> 46:48.997
My name's Alana.

46:49.039 --> 46:50.531
<i>Hi, Alana.</i>

46:50.573 --> 46:52.604
Can I come and install
the bed for you?

46:52.646 --> 46:53.777
<i>What?</i>

46:53.819 --> 46:56.879
I'd lay it down
and show you how it works.

46:56.921 --> 46:59.088
It moves in a similar way
to the ocean...

47:00.391 --> 47:03.044
wet inside.

47:03.086 --> 47:07.386
And it takes some getting used to,
but once you're in there, oh, Ted,

47:07.428 --> 47:10.389
I don't think you're
gonna be asking any questions.

47:10.431 --> 47:12.358
<i>Sounds like you just sold
a waterbed, Alana.</i>

47:12.400 --> 47:14.465
<i>Tell me, what time can you
be over with that bed?</i>

47:14.507 --> 47:17.129
Oh, well. Eager.

47:17.171 --> 47:19.401
I have to wait until
my work is done.

47:19.443 --> 47:20.631
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

47:20.673 --> 47:25.135
Yeah. I have a mean, old boss
that makes me work all day.

47:25.177 --> 47:28.040
<i>Why don't you tell Fat Bernie you
have work to do and get out of there?</i>

47:28.082 --> 47:31.073
Oh. Fat Bernie is so mean, Ted.

47:31.115 --> 47:32.175
<i>Sounds like it.</i>

47:32.217 --> 47:34.453
He keeps me locked up inside.

47:35.758 --> 47:36.881
But you know what, Ted?

47:36.923 --> 47:37.985
<i>What's that?</i>

47:38.027 --> 47:42.750
I know you're
gonna love our wet beds.

47:42.792 --> 47:44.559
- You know what they come with?
- <i>What's that?</i>

47:44.601 --> 47:46.263
A wood headboard.

47:46.305 --> 47:50.929
And that wood is strong and sticks
straight up against the wall.

47:50.971 --> 47:52.030
<i>That sounds great.</i>

47:52.072 --> 47:53.894
We don't have wood headboards.

47:53.936 --> 47:56.071
I'm gonna hand you off
to my associate, Kirk,

47:56.113 --> 47:58.105
and he's gonna take down
all your information,

47:58.147 --> 48:00.341
and I will be
at your place later, Ted.

48:00.383 --> 48:03.077
Thank you for calling Fat Bernie's.
Have a nice day.

48:03.119 --> 48:04.844
What are you doing?
We don't have beds.

48:04.886 --> 48:05.950
Well, we better get some,

48:05.992 --> 48:08.276
because water in a plastic bag
is a water balloon.

48:08.318 --> 48:09.412
With a frame, it's a bed.

48:09.454 --> 48:11.015
Let's just go
to Northridge Lumber,

48:11.057 --> 48:12.690
- they have real good...
- I wrote good dialogue. You're improvising too much.

48:12.732 --> 48:14.057
You told me
to make it more sexy.

48:14.099 --> 48:16.026
I told you to make it
more sexy, I didn't tell you,

48:16.068 --> 48:17.752
"Go over to the guy's house
and get in his bed."

48:17.794 --> 48:20.688
I told you I'm a good actress,
Gary. I told you.

48:20.730 --> 48:22.296
Don't tell me to make it
more sexy, man.

48:22.338 --> 48:25.936
If you want it more sexy,
I'll make it fucking horny.

48:25.978 --> 48:30.474
We just have our own
dreams and ideas.

48:30.516 --> 48:31.702
And so we'll just...

48:31.744 --> 48:35.111
So, just say yes.
To whatever she asks you, just say yes.

48:35.153 --> 48:37.440
Let's say, if she asks you
if you can sing, say yes.

48:37.482 --> 48:39.143
If she asks if you can dance,
say yes.

48:39.185 --> 48:40.375
I can sing, and I can dance.

48:40.417 --> 48:42.984
No, I know. I know. I know.

48:43.026 --> 48:44.979
I'm just saying that
if she asks you

48:45.021 --> 48:47.325
if you can do something that
you might not know how to do,

48:47.367 --> 48:48.453
just say yes.

48:48.495 --> 48:49.988
Because you can always
learn how to do something

48:50.030 --> 48:51.365
once you get the part.

48:53.037 --> 48:55.623
So just say yes
to whatever she asks.

48:55.665 --> 48:57.330
Whatever she asks,
just say yes.

48:57.372 --> 48:58.731
- Just say yes, just say yes...
- Okay, I got it.

48:58.773 --> 48:59.769
Okay.

49:00.371 --> 49:02.112
- Hi, Janice.
- Hi, Gary.

49:03.175 --> 49:05.049
- Mary.
- Oh, darling.

49:08.349 --> 49:12.114
So, Gary tells me
that you've been studying

49:12.156 --> 49:14.274
at Everywoman's Village
with Milton Farmer.

49:14.316 --> 49:15.610
Yes.

49:15.652 --> 49:17.686
I love his work
with young actors.

49:17.728 --> 49:20.116
He is a miracle worker.

49:25.395 --> 49:27.203
You have a warm smile,

49:28.233 --> 49:31.471
which is very powerful.

49:33.241 --> 49:36.509
And you have
a very Jewish nose,

49:37.674 --> 49:40.701
which is becoming
very fashionable.

49:40.743 --> 49:43.040
I am getting
a lot more requests

49:43.082 --> 49:44.253
for Jewish girls.

49:45.053 --> 49:46.648
Really? That's great.

49:53.926 --> 49:54.923
No.

50:00.273 --> 50:01.369
No.

50:09.711 --> 50:11.214
No.

50:15.620 --> 50:17.121
Love to Tatum.

50:18.755 --> 50:20.212
Are you athletic?

50:20.254 --> 50:21.879
You seem to have
a very firm body.

50:21.921 --> 50:22.985
Yes.

50:23.027 --> 50:25.355
Do you know
how to horseback ride?

50:25.397 --> 50:26.923
Yes.

50:26.965 --> 50:28.957
Uh, do you know
how to do fencing?

50:29.392 --> 50:30.464
Yes, I can fence.

50:32.297 --> 50:34.059
- Basketball?
- Yes.

50:34.101 --> 50:35.389
- Baseball?
- Yes.

50:35.431 --> 50:36.932
- Soccer?
- Yes.

50:38.640 --> 50:42.938
Any other sports or special
skills that I should know about?

50:43.440 --> 50:45.281
I studied Krav Maga.

50:47.419 --> 50:50.774
Well, I don't know what that is.
What is "Quick Draw McGraw"?

50:50.816 --> 50:53.942
It's martial arts from Israel.
It's used in combat.

50:53.984 --> 50:56.622
My dad was in the Israeli Army.
We all know it.

50:58.755 --> 51:03.921
So it's a form of karate,
let's say?

51:03.963 --> 51:06.632
It's more like, "How to use a
pen to stab someone's eye out."

51:10.768 --> 51:13.001
You're a goddamn
fucking fighter, aren't you?

51:13.435 --> 51:14.607
I like that.

51:16.175 --> 51:17.511
I can see that.

51:18.843 --> 51:23.142
You come here
trying to be all pretty for me,

51:23.184 --> 51:25.354
but really, you remind me...

51:28.185 --> 51:29.820
of a dog.

51:30.488 --> 51:33.824
Of an English pit bull dog...

51:35.326 --> 51:37.366
with sex appeal...

51:37.997 --> 51:39.632
and...

51:41.333 --> 51:43.666
a very Jewish nose.

51:47.144 --> 51:49.001
Do you know
any other languages?

51:49.043 --> 51:50.346
Besides English?

51:50.680 --> 51:51.733
Hebrew.

51:51.775 --> 51:55.172
- Besides Hebrew.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

51:55.214 --> 51:56.715
Um... Spanish...

51:57.314 --> 51:58.321
Oh.

51:58.985 --> 52:00.177
French...

52:00.219 --> 52:01.225
Mmm-hmm.

52:03.055 --> 52:04.327
Latin...

52:07.831 --> 52:08.958
And Portuguese.

52:12.801 --> 52:13.798
<i>Bueno.</i>

52:16.742 --> 52:18.165
<i>Fantastico.</i>

52:22.842 --> 52:24.474
Would you
be willing to work topless?

52:24.516 --> 52:25.513
Yes.

52:26.848 --> 52:27.845
No.

52:31.413 --> 52:35.754
You will lose out on work if
you're not willing to do nudity.

52:37.529 --> 52:40.217
So you'd be naked in a movie,
but you wouldn't make out with me?

52:40.259 --> 52:42.885
You'd show the whole world your
boobs, but I'm not allowed to see?

52:42.927 --> 52:44.159
You told me to say yes
to everything, remember?

52:44.201 --> 52:45.325
I told you to say no
to that, Alana.

52:45.367 --> 52:46.892
Well, I didn't know
what to say.

52:46.934 --> 52:48.096
Say "no!"

52:49.770 --> 52:52.631
I would get naked in a movie
if it gave me the part.

52:52.673 --> 52:54.398
Actresses get naked in movies
all the time.

52:54.440 --> 52:55.631
What's wrong with that, Gary?

52:55.673 --> 52:56.799
Because there's too much nudity

52:56.841 --> 52:58.406
- in pictures right now.
- Oh, come on.

52:58.448 --> 53:00.811
And you're my friend.
We're friends, Alana.

53:00.853 --> 53:02.205
And you'd do it in a movie,

53:02.247 --> 53:04.677
you'd show your boobs in a movie
but you wouldn't show them to me!

53:04.719 --> 53:07.476
Why won't you ask someone
your age to see their boobs?

53:07.518 --> 53:08.622
Because I'm asking you!

53:43.656 --> 53:45.214
Do you really wanna
see my boobs?

53:45.256 --> 53:46.330
Yes.

53:48.991 --> 53:50.994
- Where's Greg?
- He's in his room.

54:10.184 --> 54:11.454
Can I touch them?

54:13.449 --> 54:14.523
No.

54:16.256 --> 54:19.594
If you ever say anything to anyone,
I'm never speaking to you ever again.

54:20.789 --> 54:22.289
I'll see you tomorrow.

54:34.110 --> 54:37.271
Do you think it's weird I hang out
with Gary and his friends all the time?

54:43.380 --> 54:44.388
No.

54:48.894 --> 54:50.152
I think it's weird.

54:56.893 --> 54:58.963
It is whatever you think it is.

55:03.066 --> 55:04.697
I think it's weird
that I hang out with Gary

55:04.739 --> 55:06.905
and his 15-year-old friends all
the time.

55:13.651 --> 55:16.079
<i>A public
service from Earth Limited.</i>

55:22.586 --> 55:23.712
Are you happy?

55:23.754 --> 55:26.451
Yes, I'm happy. Are you happy?

55:26.493 --> 55:27.957
If you're happy, I'm happy.

55:27.999 --> 55:29.793
Of course, I'm happy!

55:29.835 --> 55:31.551
You look so great.

55:31.593 --> 55:32.667
Really?

55:33.773 --> 55:35.098
Wow.

55:42.345 --> 55:44.138
<i>The best kind of vinyl.</i>

55:44.180 --> 55:45.799
<i>Like, "Land-ho..."</i>

55:45.841 --> 55:46.901
as it says on the sign.

55:46.943 --> 55:48.003
It says "Land ho!" right there.

55:48.045 --> 55:49.245
- You can float away on it.
- Riverboat.

55:49.287 --> 55:50.346
Great for your back
and your neck.

55:50.388 --> 55:51.511
And you could just
float away on a boat.

55:51.553 --> 55:52.574
Right on your back,
or right here.

55:52.616 --> 55:53.681
And Arabian vinyl

55:53.723 --> 55:55.075
- is the best kind of vinyl.
- It's the best kind.

55:55.117 --> 55:57.151
Nothing will puncture.
We tested it.

55:57.193 --> 55:58.383
We tested it under, like,

55:58.425 --> 56:00.352
the worst conditions.

56:00.394 --> 56:02.184
This is our "Big Bernie."

56:02.226 --> 56:04.924
- It's the "Serious Sleeper."
- That right? Mmm-hmm.

56:04.966 --> 56:08.766
Um... "It's the classic design
copied by all the others."

56:08.808 --> 56:10.199
Guys, calm down.

56:10.241 --> 56:12.096
Don't wrestle on the bed, okay?

56:12.138 --> 56:14.200
I know she likes the bean bag,
but you need the Big Bernie.

56:14.242 --> 56:15.644
Deanna.

56:19.578 --> 56:20.814
You stop! Shut up!

56:25.484 --> 56:27.280
Sue Pomerantz.

56:27.322 --> 56:28.886
Gary Valentine.

56:30.986 --> 56:33.789
This is our "Arabian Night,"

56:33.831 --> 56:38.055
our highest-end model, and also
made from 100% Arabian vinyl.

56:38.097 --> 56:40.861
This is Fat Bernie's
personal king-size mattress.

56:40.903 --> 56:44.629
He has the heater, the
headboard, the side ashtrays,

56:44.671 --> 56:46.798
- and the lamp fixtures.
- Hmm.

56:46.840 --> 56:48.898
And what happens
if Fat Bernie falls asleep

56:48.940 --> 56:50.567
while he's smoking
in his waterbed?

56:50.609 --> 56:52.139
That is a great question.

56:52.181 --> 56:55.474
Actually, the water is too cold to
allow the cigarette to burn through.

56:55.516 --> 56:56.979
- Oh, that's smart.
- Uh-huh.

56:57.021 --> 56:58.175
So, it's cold?

56:58.217 --> 57:00.814
Well, in the summer, it is,
and in the winter, it isn't.

57:00.856 --> 57:03.549
Let me take you over here,
"Land Ho, The Riverboat,"

57:03.591 --> 57:05.079
made with, also, Arabian vinyl.

57:05.121 --> 57:06.587
Hi, welcome
to Fat Bernie's.

57:06.629 --> 57:08.796
Don't forget to sit
in the bean bag chair.

57:09.863 --> 57:12.426
Fat Bernie's waterbeds,
bean bag chairs.

57:13.204 --> 57:15.033
Hi, welcome to Fat Bernie's.

57:15.774 --> 57:16.771
Hi.

57:17.768 --> 57:18.893
Welcome to Fat Bernie's.

57:18.935 --> 57:20.503
These are UL approved.

57:20.545 --> 57:21.995
And if they say you can do it,
you can do it.

57:22.037 --> 57:24.735
Hi. And who is this, Gary?

57:24.777 --> 57:28.001
Gary. Hi. I'm the manager here.

57:28.043 --> 57:29.177
- I'm Alana.
- Mmm.

57:29.219 --> 57:31.410
Alana, Sue. Sue, Alana.

57:31.452 --> 57:32.477
- Hi.
- Hello,

57:32.519 --> 57:33.845
it's nice to meet you.

57:33.887 --> 57:35.685
Hey, Gary, can I steal you
for a second?

57:35.727 --> 57:38.781
I just wanna see how you want
these orders written out.

57:38.823 --> 57:40.025
I'll be right there.

57:41.157 --> 57:42.592
Well, I really need
to know soon,

57:42.634 --> 57:44.825
because I really want
the paperwork to be correct.

57:44.867 --> 57:46.854
We don't wanna get it wrong
on the first day, do we?

57:46.896 --> 57:48.033
I'll be right there.

57:52.836 --> 57:54.036
Is everything okay?

57:54.078 --> 57:55.434
Yes, of course.

57:55.476 --> 57:56.502
Is that your girlfriend?

57:56.544 --> 57:57.703
No, that is not my girlfriend.

57:57.745 --> 57:59.637
Does it seem like
she's my girlfriend?

57:59.679 --> 58:00.683
Kind of.

58:01.316 --> 58:02.705
No. I mean...

58:02.747 --> 58:04.213
No. She works for me.

58:04.255 --> 58:05.615
She used to be my babysitter.

58:05.657 --> 58:06.874
Now, I'm gonna take you
over here. This is the...

58:33.714 --> 58:35.014
I'm so high.

58:35.714 --> 58:37.621
Kirk got me stoned.

58:39.891 --> 58:40.908
Okay...

58:40.950 --> 58:42.843
I'm very happy, Gary.

58:42.885 --> 58:43.921
Mmm-hmm.

58:43.963 --> 58:46.422
Congratulations.

58:46.464 --> 58:48.248
We did this together,
didn't we?

58:48.290 --> 58:50.422
- Uh-huh. We did. Okay.
- We did it.

58:50.464 --> 58:51.800
Are you happy?

01:00:59.693 --> 01:01:00.731
Oh, shit.

01:01:01.696 --> 01:01:04.163
Hey, come back, toots.

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:09.866
<i>Sunday Night Movie</i>

01:01:09.908 --> 01:01:12.225
<i>presents some of the most
outstanding feature films</i>

01:01:12.267 --> 01:01:13.962
<i>in motion picture history.</i>

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:16.780
Excuse me. What the fuck?

01:01:24.453 --> 01:01:25.872
Alana.

01:01:25.914 --> 01:01:29.418
<i>You know, Rainbow,
you're a complete mystery to me.</i>

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.878
<i>I don't know a word about you.</i>

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:34.883
<i>I don't know who your friends
are, if you've got parents...</i>

01:01:34.925 --> 01:01:35.988
Alana!

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:37.526
...if you're in
some kind of trouble...

01:01:39.536 --> 01:01:41.035
You can tell me, you know.

01:01:42.567 --> 01:01:44.775
There's
no mystery here, Frankie.

01:01:46.645 --> 01:01:49.770
I come from
Intercourse, Pennsylvania.

01:01:49.812 --> 01:01:51.769
I know,
I've heard all the jokes.

01:01:51.811 --> 01:01:53.377
I didn't say a word.

01:01:53.977 --> 01:01:55.842
It gets better.

01:01:55.884 --> 01:01:57.206
You have to
pass through "Faithful"

01:01:57.248 --> 01:01:58.879
to get there.

01:01:58.921 --> 01:02:01.216
That must be quite
some cross to bear.

01:02:04.329 --> 01:02:07.617
My parents are dead.

01:02:07.659 --> 01:02:11.459
They were killed in an automobile
accident five years ago.

01:02:11.501 --> 01:02:14.225
They were nice people.

01:02:14.267 --> 01:02:16.939
Nothing really happens
in Intercourse, you know.

01:02:18.137 --> 01:02:20.629
So as soon as
I graduated high school,

01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:24.573
I grabbed my bag and my guitar,
and I came to California.

01:02:27.351 --> 01:02:29.206
And, cut-a-rooski.

01:02:29.248 --> 01:02:31.822
- That was wonderful.
- Thank you, Alana.

01:02:32.757 --> 01:02:34.616
This says you know
how to ride a horse.

01:02:34.983 --> 01:02:36.484
Yes.

01:02:36.526 --> 01:02:38.191
And you speak Portuguese.

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:39.952
Mmm-hmm.

01:02:39.994 --> 01:02:42.922
Rainbow loves horses
and archery.

01:02:42.964 --> 01:02:44.995
That's a subplot
we've been developing.

01:02:45.037 --> 01:02:47.729
We would wanna make sure that
actresses under consideration

01:02:47.771 --> 01:02:49.893
are capable
of doing these things.

01:02:49.935 --> 01:02:51.303
Yes, I can do both.

01:02:53.107 --> 01:02:55.839
Thank you, Alana.
Thank you for coming.

01:02:55.881 --> 01:02:58.340
I feel like I've been with
Rainbow for 10 minutes,

01:02:58.382 --> 01:02:59.542
don't you, Jack?

01:03:00.482 --> 01:03:01.544
Absolutely.

01:03:02.443 --> 01:03:03.986
Thank you, Mr. Holden.

01:03:08.226 --> 01:03:09.453
You know...

01:03:10.395 --> 01:03:13.556
you remind me of Grace.

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:18.066
Kelly?

01:03:30.982 --> 01:03:33.101
Mr. Holden,

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:34.676
another martini, sir?

01:03:35.143 --> 01:03:36.183
Yes, please.

01:03:36.748 --> 01:03:37.811
Another?

01:03:38.222 --> 01:03:39.880
Sure.

01:03:39.922 --> 01:03:42.178
- Make it three.
- Okay.

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:44.752
I've never had
a martini before.

01:03:45.495 --> 01:03:47.029
They're good.

01:03:50.499 --> 01:03:51.759
The jungle.

01:03:53.032 --> 01:03:54.696
That's where I'm most myself.

01:03:56.275 --> 01:03:57.534
Not this jungle.

01:03:59.034 --> 01:04:00.042
Africa.

01:04:01.346 --> 01:04:04.734
Oh. Yes, Africa.

01:04:04.776 --> 01:04:09.282
I saw two of my best Black
friends beheaded in the Congo.

01:04:10.449 --> 01:04:13.682
I'll tell you intimacies
I've shared with no one.

01:04:17.025 --> 01:04:19.622
But don't ask me
about Kuala Lumpur.

01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:24.132
Is this lines

01:04:24.963 --> 01:04:26.695
or is this real?

01:04:29.807 --> 01:04:31.799
You're such
a delicate creature.

01:04:33.477 --> 01:04:35.209
You are Rainbow.

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:38.099
I'm Jewish.

01:04:40.143 --> 01:04:41.710
What's funny?

01:04:44.412 --> 01:04:46.240
It's true.

01:04:46.282 --> 01:04:49.157
Is that Rex damn Blau?

01:04:49.757 --> 01:04:51.048
Who said Blau?

01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:53.656
Right over here. Blau!

01:04:55.959 --> 01:04:57.085
Jack!

01:04:57.127 --> 01:04:58.221
Wait till you meet

01:04:58.263 --> 01:05:00.191
this character.

01:05:00.233 --> 01:05:04.131
Jack goddamn Holden. Bang.

01:05:04.173 --> 01:05:07.469
You son of a bitch from hell,
get over here.

01:05:07.511 --> 01:05:09.802
You shiny, golden,

01:05:09.844 --> 01:05:13.373
tall, inexpensive prick.

01:05:13.415 --> 01:05:15.874
- My goodness.
- It's so good to see you.

01:05:15.916 --> 01:05:17.206
There is God's...

01:05:20.355 --> 01:05:22.248
Think of any six
numbers, I can guess them.

01:05:22.290 --> 01:05:23.651
- Okay.
- I can guess them. All right.

01:05:23.693 --> 01:05:24.883
- Okay.
- You're thinking

01:05:24.925 --> 01:05:28.589
six, three, four, five.

01:05:28.631 --> 01:05:29.925
- Hey.
- Henri!

01:05:29.967 --> 01:05:31.225
- Always happy to see you.
- Good to see you.

01:05:31.267 --> 01:05:32.562
- Good to see you as well.
- Yeah, are you staying?

01:05:32.604 --> 01:05:34.556
I'm great, yes. Of course.

01:05:34.598 --> 01:05:36.699
Hey. We can always do
take-out tonight.

01:05:37.939 --> 01:05:38.962
- He looks around.
- No way.

01:05:39.004 --> 01:05:40.043
He's all scruffy.

01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:44.841
Interesting development
to the plot, Henri.

01:05:44.883 --> 01:05:47.400
Well, let's not have
any trouble, please.

01:05:47.442 --> 01:05:48.669
No trouble, no trouble.

01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:49.973
This is Tail o' the Cock,
this is my place.

01:05:50.015 --> 01:05:51.276
Yes, I'm staying.

01:05:51.318 --> 01:05:52.982
It's a table for four, please.
Table 38?

01:05:53.024 --> 01:05:54.916
Well, tonight you might want
a different table.

01:05:54.958 --> 01:05:56.343
- What do you think?
- Table 38, Henri.

01:05:56.385 --> 01:05:57.983
With direct sight lines.

01:05:58.025 --> 01:06:00.954
Direct sight lines, huh? Okay.

01:06:07.033 --> 01:06:08.764
Oh, no.

01:06:08.806 --> 01:06:11.140
Full of gas
on the railroad.

01:06:12.734 --> 01:06:15.695
Now, you know what
I'd like to say...

01:06:15.737 --> 01:06:17.540
Have you ever seen him
on a bike?

01:06:17.582 --> 01:06:18.868
I see it spin.

01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:20.268
Good.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:21.977
I know you know I knew

01:06:22.019 --> 01:06:24.879
- and know I do.
- No. Yeah, well...

01:06:24.921 --> 01:06:26.614
I'm patient. I'm a patient man.

01:06:26.656 --> 01:06:28.546
The hell you are.

01:06:28.588 --> 01:06:30.545
There is this kind of
a biblical feeling...

01:06:30.587 --> 01:06:31.711
Yeah, but...
It's just not.

01:06:31.753 --> 01:06:33.349
Someone
will be right over.

01:06:33.391 --> 01:06:34.880
- Thank you, Henri.
- Thank you.

01:06:34.922 --> 01:06:36.391
Watch, you gotta watch him.

01:06:36.433 --> 01:06:37.486
Oh, yeah.

01:06:37.528 --> 01:06:39.560
Oh, no.
Whatever it isn't.

01:06:39.602 --> 01:06:40.824
Jack,

01:06:40.866 --> 01:06:43.466
you know what I got out there
in the parking lot right now?

01:06:45.402 --> 01:06:46.604
- Right on.
- Mmm.

01:06:47.235 --> 01:06:49.001
650cc.

01:06:49.043 --> 01:06:52.031
No, no. You mischievous man.

01:06:52.073 --> 01:06:55.448
A full desert sled.
It's out there for you, Jack.

01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:57.981
It's built for you.

01:06:58.023 --> 01:06:59.906
- I'm seeing it spin now.
- It's spinning.

01:06:59.948 --> 01:07:02.785
I know it's spinning,
and it's gotta spin back.

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:04.921
Come on,
you know you want it.

01:07:04.963 --> 01:07:06.756
- No.
- You know you need it.

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:08.419
Oh, yeah, you do.

01:07:08.461 --> 01:07:10.583
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah, you bet.

01:07:10.625 --> 01:07:12.421
Gary, Gary, Gary, I see Alana.

01:07:12.463 --> 01:07:15.161
Kirk,
assassin's focus.

01:07:15.203 --> 01:07:17.099
Gritted teeth
and fixed bayonets.

01:07:25.608 --> 01:07:26.842
- Armand!
- Okay. Bastard.

01:07:26.884 --> 01:07:27.937
What are you guys
talking about?

01:07:27.979 --> 01:07:29.369
Bastard.

01:07:29.411 --> 01:07:31.042
What are we doing?

01:07:31.084 --> 01:07:32.412
Yes, Mr. Rex?

01:07:32.454 --> 01:07:35.443
Armand, I need three
wing-back chairs from the bar,

01:07:35.485 --> 01:07:36.711
I need a bottle of Everclear,

01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:39.087
I need plenty of grease
from the kitchen.

01:07:39.129 --> 01:07:41.221
And I want you to meet me
on the eighth hole

01:07:41.263 --> 01:07:44.955
by the sand trap,
<i>dos minutos. Pronto.</i>

01:07:44.997 --> 01:07:46.354
<i>Apurarse.</i>

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:48.123
We're burning daylight!

01:07:50.306 --> 01:07:53.671
I gotta do some prep.
I'll see you kids later.

01:08:02.678 --> 01:08:04.814
Did you see <i>No Time for Honor?</i>

01:08:04.856 --> 01:08:06.147
- With Jack Holden?
- Yeah.

01:08:06.189 --> 01:08:07.815
Do you guys
wanna order martinis?

01:08:07.857 --> 01:08:09.644
I can get us martinis.

01:08:09.686 --> 01:08:11.458
I'll get us
four martinis right now.

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:16.423
"The Bridges span a narrow gap
between two targets.

01:08:16.465 --> 01:08:20.095
They're the most important
targets in all of Korea.

01:08:20.138 --> 01:08:22.832
Consequently,
they're fortified accordingly.

01:08:24.274 --> 01:08:26.997
Although we're only over
the targets 30 seconds,

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.442
it's a lifetime."

01:08:30.044 --> 01:08:31.841
We're going to Korea?

01:08:33.344 --> 01:08:35.304
I don't understand.

01:08:35.345 --> 01:08:36.910
But I'm sexy, right?

01:08:36.952 --> 01:08:39.805
"Every gun imaginable

01:08:39.848 --> 01:08:41.774
is hidden in those mountainsides.

01:08:41.816 --> 01:08:44.178
And the men behind the guns..."

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.316
Mmm-hmm.

01:08:45.358 --> 01:08:47.316
"They know where
we're coming from

01:08:47.358 --> 01:08:48.792
and where we're headed.

01:08:50.363 --> 01:08:52.587
We're gonna fly
right between them.

01:08:52.629 --> 01:08:55.831
We're gonna fly
low and straight

01:08:55.872 --> 01:08:58.658
with no element of surprise.

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:00.540
And they're just sitting there

01:09:01.173 --> 01:09:02.674
waiting for us,

01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:04.907
hoping we'll come.

01:09:09.076 --> 01:09:13.442
Those are the Bridges
of Toko-San, Nancy."

01:09:13.484 --> 01:09:15.212
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:09:15.254 --> 01:09:17.444
good people of The Cock,

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:19.282
put that dinner down.

01:09:19.323 --> 01:09:21.856
That salad can wait.

01:09:21.898 --> 01:09:25.319
Let that steak get cold.

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:30.129
'Cause tonight, we have a man who
needs no introduction, really.

01:09:30.171 --> 01:09:32.296
His name is Mr. Jack Holden.

01:09:37.078 --> 01:09:38.205
That's right.

01:09:38.247 --> 01:09:41.144
And if you've seen
his pictures,

01:09:41.185 --> 01:09:44.508
then you know
that every goddamn one of them

01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:47.376
has got Jack riding
a motorcycle,

01:09:47.417 --> 01:09:49.511
as if it's the only way

01:09:49.554 --> 01:09:51.484
to travel.

01:09:51.526 --> 01:09:55.218
Whether he's in the jungle,
or he's in Manila,

01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:57.222
or he's in Paris,

01:09:57.264 --> 01:10:00.392
or if he's in Rio de Janeiro.

01:10:00.434 --> 01:10:03.358
They don't have taxis
in the desert.

01:10:04.875 --> 01:10:05.935
Thank you, Jack.

01:10:07.075 --> 01:10:08.864
And for those of you

01:10:08.906 --> 01:10:12.732
who perhaps may have seen
a little film called,

01:10:12.774 --> 01:10:15.339
<i>The Bridges of Toko-San...</i>

01:10:15.381 --> 01:10:16.748
Yeah.

01:10:18.589 --> 01:10:19.586
Kirk.

01:10:20.889 --> 01:10:22.016
Jack

01:10:22.058 --> 01:10:26.717
and the beautiful Grace Kelly.

01:10:26.759 --> 01:10:31.059
Well, tonight, you're lucky,
'cause tonight,

01:10:32.170 --> 01:10:35.569
we bring Toko-San
right here to Encino.

01:10:39.009 --> 01:10:40.935
That's right. That's right.

01:10:40.977 --> 01:10:42.733
Thank you. Thank you.

01:10:42.775 --> 01:10:46.103
On your feet now,
follow me to the eighth hole.

01:10:46.145 --> 01:10:47.482
Here we go.

01:10:49.987 --> 01:10:51.486
Would you mind to play Grace?

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.775
Jack, I don't know
how to ride a motorcycle.

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:56.755
You just have to hold on tight.

01:10:57.926 --> 01:10:59.451
Let's ride.

01:10:59.493 --> 01:11:02.596
That's my Rainbow.
Rainbow rides.

01:11:03.858 --> 01:11:07.787
Fire up those torches! Now!

01:11:07.829 --> 01:11:10.327
Hold on, people. Single file.

01:11:10.369 --> 01:11:13.765
Single file. There we go.

01:11:13.807 --> 01:11:18.172
Okay. Right along the ridge.
Right along the ridge.

01:11:18.883 --> 01:11:20.469
Thank you, good people.

01:11:22.613 --> 01:11:23.640
Okay, Armand,

01:11:23.682 --> 01:11:25.619
will you handle
that crowd for me?

01:11:25.986 --> 01:11:27.049
Okay.

01:11:28.325 --> 01:11:33.612
All right, people.
I need some more flame.

01:11:33.654 --> 01:11:35.123
More flame.

01:11:38.295 --> 01:11:39.699
God.

01:11:40.862 --> 01:11:43.162
It's a great night for a jump.

01:11:49.343 --> 01:11:51.132
I can't believe it!

01:11:51.174 --> 01:11:52.208
He came here.
He's definitely gonna do it.

01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:53.603
I can't wait
to see this shit.

01:11:53.645 --> 01:11:54.813
Oh,
he's gonna do it.

01:12:15.102 --> 01:12:16.406
All right.

01:12:17.868 --> 01:12:20.366
Can I have some quiet
on the set?

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:22.610
Roll sound.

01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:25.272
Roll camera A.

01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:27.450
Roll camera B.

01:12:28.512 --> 01:12:30.915
Okay. Mark it.

01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:36.789
Action, Jack.

01:12:41.563 --> 01:12:44.390
Do you even remember
what my real name is?

01:12:45.595 --> 01:12:48.064
Whoa.

01:12:55.971 --> 01:12:58.371
Keep your gas.
Attaboy. Attaboy.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.916
Looks like he's coming in hot.

01:13:06.088 --> 01:13:09.459
I'm coming, Nancy!

01:13:10.992 --> 01:13:12.052
Yeah!

01:13:21.765 --> 01:13:23.228
I fucked up Danielle's guitar.

01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:24.528
Are you okay?

01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:26.674
I fucked up Danielle's guitar.

01:13:28.977 --> 01:13:30.744
Oh, man.

01:13:36.679 --> 01:13:38.276
I'm all right!

01:13:45.923 --> 01:13:48.490
<i>Toko-San! Toko-San!</i>

01:13:48.532 --> 01:13:51.993
<i>Toko-San! Toko-San!
Toko-San! Toko-San!</i>

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:57.133
This man needs a drink!

01:13:57.175 --> 01:13:59.224
- To the Cock!
- To the Cock!

01:14:01.969 --> 01:14:04.499
<i>Toko-San! Toko-San!</i>

01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:06.274
<i>Toko-San!</i>

01:14:11.055 --> 01:14:13.940
<i>Toko-San! Toko-San!</i>

01:16:13.243 --> 01:16:16.029
<i>...decided to
use their oil as a political weapon.</i>

01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:18.139
<i>They will reduce oil production</i>

01:16:18.181 --> 01:16:19.808
<i>by 5% a month</i>

01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:23.073
<i>until the Israelis withdraw
from occupied territory.</i>

01:16:23.115 --> 01:16:24.743
<i>If the Arab countries
keep that pledge,</i>

01:16:24.785 --> 01:16:26.875
<i>it would reduce
their production</i>

01:16:26.917 --> 01:16:29.576
<i>by almost 50% in one year.</i>

01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:31.112
<i>According
to some of our leaders,</i>

01:16:31.154 --> 01:16:33.986
<i>as the Arab
oil embargo continues,</i>

01:16:34.028 --> 01:16:36.484
<i>the situation will become
increasingly worse</i>

01:16:36.526 --> 01:16:40.123
<i>and we may be forced into
a gas rationing program.</i>

01:16:40.165 --> 01:16:41.291
<i>The immediate shortage</i>

01:16:41.333 --> 01:16:44.228
<i>will affect the lives
of each and every one of us.</i>

01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:46.830
<i>In our factories, our cars,
our homes, our offices,</i>

01:16:46.872 --> 01:16:49.229
<i>we will have to use less fuel</i>

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:51.099
<i>than we are
accustomed to using.</i>

01:16:51.141 --> 01:16:53.641
<i>The fuel crisis need
not mean...</i>

01:16:53.683 --> 01:16:55.843
Did you know there was
an oil embargo?

01:16:55.885 --> 01:16:58.178
<i>...require
some sacrifice by all.</i>

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:00.073
Wait, what?

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:01.647
Do you understand any of this?

01:17:03.561 --> 01:17:05.115
<i>Major tie-ups like these</i>

01:17:05.157 --> 01:17:07.856
<i>are becoming more frequent
in Los Angeles.</i>

01:17:07.898 --> 01:17:09.323
- <i>Will your gas supplies...</i>
- Huh?

01:17:09.365 --> 01:17:10.359
<i>...hold out very long?</i>

01:17:11.128 --> 01:17:14.020
The beds are made
from vinyl, Gary.

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:16.293
Vinyl is made from oil.

01:17:16.335 --> 01:17:17.427
<i>Do you have
any idea what that means?</i>

01:17:17.469 --> 01:17:18.591
It is?

01:17:18.633 --> 01:17:20.664
Fucking duh. What did you
think it was made out of?

01:17:20.706 --> 01:17:21.764
- Gold?
- I don't know.

01:17:21.806 --> 01:17:23.967
I thought it was, um...

01:17:24.009 --> 01:17:26.373
- What? Magic?
- I thought it was...

01:17:26.415 --> 01:17:27.475
Like a scientific fabric.

01:17:27.517 --> 01:17:28.850
I thought it was like a rubber.

01:17:31.050 --> 01:17:34.206
Which is also made
out of oil, dipshit.

01:17:34.248 --> 01:17:37.145
<i>Filled up. Have to wait till
I got some money to get it filled up.</i>

01:17:37.187 --> 01:17:38.683
<i>I tried to pump gas</i>

01:17:38.725 --> 01:17:40.113
<i>on the way home last night</i>

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:41.686
<i>and had a little success.</i>

01:17:41.728 --> 01:17:43.225
<i>What little money I had on me,</i>

01:17:43.267 --> 01:17:46.824
<i>I got a couple of dollars' worth,
but, I'm afraid for the weekend.</i>

01:18:10.088 --> 01:18:12.586
It's the end
of the world, Greggo.

01:20:01.305 --> 01:20:02.495
Hey, fellas.

01:20:02.537 --> 01:20:03.532
Hello.

01:20:04.866 --> 01:20:06.797
Which one is in charge?
Are you? Are you in charge?

01:20:06.839 --> 01:20:08.001
Yeah, I'm in charge.

01:20:08.043 --> 01:20:09.768
May I just speak with you
for a second?

01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:10.968
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

01:20:11.010 --> 01:20:12.132
You can tell your crew to stop.

01:20:12.174 --> 01:20:13.344
Stop for a sec, guys.

01:20:14.074 --> 01:20:15.247
Um...

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:18.036
So, this is what
I wanna say to you.

01:20:18.078 --> 01:20:19.086
Um...

01:20:20.690 --> 01:20:22.310
- Do you know who I am?
- Yeah.

01:20:22.352 --> 01:20:23.816
Do you know who
my girlfriend is?

01:20:24.823 --> 01:20:26.027
Barbra Streisand.

01:20:26.694 --> 01:20:27.821
Barbra "Streisand."

01:20:27.863 --> 01:20:29.320
- "Sand."
- "Sand." Yeah, like "sands."

01:20:29.362 --> 01:20:31.557
- Like the ocean, like beaches.
- Barbra Streisand.

01:20:31.599 --> 01:20:33.194
No. "Streisand."

01:20:33.236 --> 01:20:34.563
"Sand."

01:20:34.605 --> 01:20:36.565
- "Streisand."
- "Streisand."

01:20:38.937 --> 01:20:40.206
"Barbra Streisand."

01:20:41.742 --> 01:20:43.044
"Barbra Streisand."

01:20:44.779 --> 01:20:45.948
Are you fucking with me?

01:20:46.782 --> 01:20:48.006
All right, let's get past that.

01:20:48.048 --> 01:20:49.469
Hopefully, you never
fucking meet her.

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:51.875
She'll fucking...
You think I'm bad.

01:20:51.917 --> 01:20:54.681
So, we're going to the movies right
now and I'm on my way to pick her up,

01:20:54.723 --> 01:20:56.142
so I'm gonna leave you here.

01:20:56.184 --> 01:20:58.548
But, I wouldn't normally leave somebody
in my house when I'm not there,

01:20:58.590 --> 01:21:00.712
but I have to because you guys
are so motherfucking late.

01:21:00.754 --> 01:21:02.081
- I'm sorry. There was no gas.
- Yeah, well,

01:21:02.123 --> 01:21:04.758
that's an excuse I'm gonna shove
up your fucking penis hole, man.

01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:07.891
What's your name?

01:21:07.933 --> 01:21:09.894
- Gary.
- Gary. Gary.

01:21:09.936 --> 01:21:11.257
How big is your penis hole?

01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:12.764
It's regular sized.

01:21:12.806 --> 01:21:14.336
Hmm. How would you know?

01:21:14.378 --> 01:21:17.365
Imagine what that would feel like,
if I shoved that excuse up there.

01:21:17.407 --> 01:21:19.674
- That would hurt a lot, right?
- Yeah.

01:21:19.716 --> 01:21:21.602
But that's what I'd like to do.

01:21:21.644 --> 01:21:23.272
I'm sorry, I don't wanna
make you any more late

01:21:23.314 --> 01:21:24.987
than you already are.
You can leave.

01:21:25.987 --> 01:21:27.880
Look at you,
you cocky motherfucker.

01:21:29.623 --> 01:21:30.718
I like it.

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:39.361
We speak the same language, huh?
We're both from the streets.

01:21:39.403 --> 01:21:40.521
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:21:40.563 --> 01:21:42.897
I didn't see it before.
That's... Wow.

01:21:42.939 --> 01:21:45.358
Wow, you get right in there
and you do it.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.395
Wow. You have a little, um...

01:21:47.437 --> 01:21:48.728
You have a tincture
in your left eye.

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:51.034
It means that you're deficient
in vitamin K.

01:21:51.076 --> 01:21:52.436
I'm like a fucking doctor.

01:21:52.478 --> 01:21:55.610
You need to take more vitamin D
and cod liver oil.

01:21:55.652 --> 01:21:56.974
You see that Daytona Ferrari?

01:21:57.016 --> 01:21:58.911
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's mine.

01:22:00.151 --> 01:22:01.608
Gary, that's filled with gas.

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:03.742
That's gonna get me
to the movies on time.

01:22:03.784 --> 01:22:05.277
'Cause I'm not
a shithead idiot fuck-up,

01:22:05.319 --> 01:22:06.451
I'm Jon Peters.

01:22:06.493 --> 01:22:09.085
My only problem in life
is that I love tail too much.

01:22:09.127 --> 01:22:11.033
I love it. I love it so much.

01:22:12.029 --> 01:22:13.122
I love it so much.

01:22:13.164 --> 01:22:14.761
- Is that your sister?
- No.

01:22:14.803 --> 01:22:16.467
- It's your girlfriend?
- No.

01:22:21.011 --> 01:22:23.210
I love it so much,
it's gonna kill me one day.

01:22:24.376 --> 01:22:25.935
- You know how much tail I get?
- No.

01:22:25.977 --> 01:22:27.016
All of it.

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.437
It's all mine.

01:22:29.479 --> 01:22:30.943
- You like Barbra Streisand?
- Yeah...

01:22:31.555 --> 01:22:33.272
- You do?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:22:33.314 --> 01:22:34.386
Do you?

01:22:34.885 --> 01:22:35.882
Yeah.

01:22:38.021 --> 01:22:39.511
I do, too.

01:22:39.553 --> 01:22:41.063
Gets boring, but you know...

01:22:42.059 --> 01:22:43.825
Yeah.

01:22:43.867 --> 01:22:45.857
I'm gonna kill you
and your family

01:22:45.899 --> 01:22:47.465
if you fuck up my house.

01:22:48.906 --> 01:22:50.931
- Okay? Do you have a cat?
- No. No.

01:22:50.973 --> 01:22:52.100
- You got a dog?
- No.

01:22:52.142 --> 01:22:53.628
- Your brother and sister...
- Brother.

01:22:53.670 --> 01:22:55.034
Yeah. Your brother?
I'm gonna fucking choke

01:22:55.076 --> 01:22:56.268
your brother out
right in front of you.

01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:58.841
Okay, Steve's gonna look
after you while I'm gone.

01:22:58.883 --> 01:23:00.708
Uh, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Gary.

01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:02.174
I want you to be horrified.

01:23:02.216 --> 01:23:04.140
- Okay.
- Your life's on the line.

01:23:04.182 --> 01:23:06.010
But you know from that, right?

01:23:06.052 --> 01:23:07.254
It's the way of the streets.

01:23:16.896 --> 01:23:18.626
Miss Streisand?

01:23:18.668 --> 01:23:21.155
Hi, it's Steve. Mmm-hmm.

01:23:21.197 --> 01:23:22.566
Yes, he just left.

01:23:24.707 --> 01:23:28.702
I also thought you might wanna know
that he ordered a waterbed this evening.

01:23:28.744 --> 01:23:31.171
Right now. Mmm-hmm.

01:23:31.213 --> 01:23:33.975
Four small children and a girl
or a young woman.

01:23:34.017 --> 01:23:36.204
To be honest,
I don't know what she is.

01:23:36.246 --> 01:23:38.714
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Okay.

01:23:40.355 --> 01:23:45.127
Yes. Sure will. Thanks,
Miss Streisand. Uh-huh. Bye.

01:23:45.626 --> 01:23:46.920
Okay.

01:24:05.410 --> 01:24:07.380
I used to work
with Julie Andrews.

01:24:07.615 --> 01:24:08.612
Oh.

01:24:13.051 --> 01:24:14.717
She was difficult.

01:24:15.625 --> 01:24:16.785
Mmm-hmm.

01:24:26.166 --> 01:24:28.060
He said he was gonna kill Greg.

01:25:07.634 --> 01:25:08.936
We're done, let's go.

01:25:20.182 --> 01:25:21.241
Boo.

01:25:24.287 --> 01:25:25.491
Jerks.

01:25:27.359 --> 01:25:28.786
"I'm gonna choke your brother."

01:25:28.828 --> 01:25:29.825
Uh-huh.

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:33.091
I kept it inside,
but what I wanted to say was,

01:25:33.133 --> 01:25:35.028
"No, I'm gonna choke you."

01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:36.426
- Oh, yeah?
- I would've said it.

01:25:36.468 --> 01:25:37.831
I was trying
to stay cool though.

01:25:37.873 --> 01:25:39.571
I was trying to stay...

01:25:55.185 --> 01:25:56.522
Scooch over.

01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:02.924
Back it up. Oh, fuck.

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:08.496
We're going back
up the hill, okay?

01:26:08.538 --> 01:26:09.733
Okay.

01:26:12.071 --> 01:26:13.295
How'd it turn out?

01:26:13.337 --> 01:26:14.662
It was good. Went well.

01:26:14.704 --> 01:26:16.196
You didn't fuck up my house,
did you?

01:26:16.238 --> 01:26:17.839
No.

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:19.535
You okay? Can you see okay?

01:26:19.577 --> 01:26:21.071
- Yeah.
- Well, why don't you just...

01:26:21.113 --> 01:26:24.209
Why don't you just back in the
driveway, and then you can go straight.

01:26:26.690 --> 01:26:29.621
Steve. Steve.

01:26:41.303 --> 01:26:44.697
You blew it, man.
You blew it. Did she call?

01:26:44.739 --> 01:26:45.866
No.

01:26:45.908 --> 01:26:47.606
God damn it, Steve.

01:26:51.542 --> 01:26:54.737
Where the fuck is the...
God damn.

01:26:54.779 --> 01:26:58.207
There's no gas-o
in the goddamn car-o, Steve-o.

01:26:58.249 --> 01:26:59.552
Motherfucker.

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:09.430
How long you guys
been together?

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:12.292
- Me and her?
- Yeah.

01:27:12.334 --> 01:27:14.254
- Oh, we're not together.
- We're not together.

01:27:14.296 --> 01:27:15.304
Why not?

01:27:15.970 --> 01:27:17.097
I don't know.

01:27:18.773 --> 01:27:19.770
What?

01:27:20.434 --> 01:27:21.869
I'm 28.

01:27:21.911 --> 01:27:24.270
- What's that?
- I'm 25.

01:27:24.312 --> 01:27:26.007
You're 25?
When's your birthday?

01:27:27.114 --> 01:27:28.274
- December.
- December.

01:27:28.316 --> 01:27:30.308
Are you a Capricorn?
Sagittarius?

01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:31.570
- Sagittarius.
- Sagittarius.

01:27:31.612 --> 01:27:33.111
December what? 13?

01:27:33.153 --> 01:27:34.981
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen.

01:27:35.023 --> 01:27:36.457
I was only two off.

01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:41.256
What do you wanna do
if you're not gonna do hair?

01:27:41.298 --> 01:27:43.662
Do you have sisters,
or brothers, or anything?

01:27:43.963 --> 01:27:45.091
Sisters.

01:27:45.133 --> 01:27:46.451
Are they older or younger?

01:27:46.493 --> 01:27:47.554
Older.

01:27:47.596 --> 01:27:48.931
So you're the youngest?

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:53.125
How about your dad?

01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:55.100
Do you have a good relationship
with your dad?

01:27:55.142 --> 01:27:56.675
- Yeah.
- What's he do?

01:27:58.143 --> 01:27:59.266
Real estate.

01:27:59.308 --> 01:28:00.942
Oh, yeah?

01:28:00.984 --> 01:28:02.384
Did he teach you how to drive?

01:28:03.315 --> 01:28:04.570
You're really good at it.

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:06.641
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:28:06.683 --> 01:28:09.721
It's not easy.
Gary can't do it.

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:20.732
All right. Just slow it down now, okay?
There she is.

01:28:22.029 --> 01:28:24.593
Okay, do you have
enough room? Yeah?

01:28:24.635 --> 01:28:26.360
- Mm-hmm.
- You sure?

01:28:26.402 --> 01:28:27.533
I think so.

01:28:27.575 --> 01:28:28.837
I parked on the side
so no one would hit it.

01:28:28.879 --> 01:28:30.132
You know what? Here.

01:28:30.174 --> 01:28:32.305
I don't want you to have to bear
the burden in case we hit it.

01:28:32.347 --> 01:28:33.935
Here, why don't
I take the wheel,

01:28:33.977 --> 01:28:35.504
and then you just
put your foot on the clutch

01:28:35.546 --> 01:28:36.772
and just feather the brake.

01:28:36.814 --> 01:28:38.809
That's it.
We'll do it together, okay?

01:28:38.851 --> 01:28:42.108
Yeah, we'll do it together, okay?
Here we go.

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:45.881
Oh, yeah. Smooth.
Smooth, yeah. Just breathe.

01:28:45.923 --> 01:28:49.355
We got it. Yeah, we got it.
I think we got it.

01:28:49.397 --> 01:28:51.990
Look. Look, look. Over there.
You see?

01:28:52.032 --> 01:28:53.094
We got it.

01:28:54.430 --> 01:28:55.864
We did it.

01:28:55.906 --> 01:28:57.789
That's so good, Alana.

01:28:57.831 --> 01:29:00.699
Oh.

01:29:00.741 --> 01:29:02.561
- Yeah. No.
- We didn't hit it at all.

01:29:02.603 --> 01:29:03.829
I...

01:29:03.871 --> 01:29:06.712
Oh, you smell so good. Whoo!

01:29:07.678 --> 01:29:10.716
Gary. Gary, Gary, Gary.

01:29:11.551 --> 01:29:13.851
Get some gas,
I'll be on my way.

01:29:16.688 --> 01:29:20.286
Oh, shit.
Look at this line, man.

01:29:22.627 --> 01:29:24.421
Fucking sardines
packed in a can.

01:29:24.463 --> 01:29:25.822
Go, just make a left here.

01:29:25.864 --> 01:29:28.057
I'm not fucking waiting
in this motherfucker.

01:29:28.099 --> 01:29:30.195
All right, let that car just go past.
There you go.

01:29:30.237 --> 01:29:31.662
Okay, now, stop it.

01:29:31.704 --> 01:29:33.498
Oh, they'll...
They'll move out of the way.

01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:35.873
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Okay, stop the car.

01:29:38.645 --> 01:29:43.374
God! Fuck. Son of a bitch.
Fucking shit!

01:29:43.416 --> 01:29:44.948
What you got, motherfucker?

01:29:45.715 --> 01:29:48.044
Fucking Chumash Territory!

01:29:48.086 --> 01:29:50.316
Goddamn sons of bitches
don't even know where they are.

01:29:53.824 --> 01:29:55.992
Yeah, motherfucker,
that's right.

01:29:57.099 --> 01:29:58.632
It's my nozzle now.

01:29:59.662 --> 01:30:01.194
Go. Let's go. Let's go.

01:30:01.236 --> 01:30:02.429
- Just reverse it.
- Now?

01:30:02.471 --> 01:30:04.394
Reverse, reverse, reverse.

01:30:04.436 --> 01:30:06.397
- It's your move!
- Okay.

01:30:06.439 --> 01:30:08.301
- Relax.
- It's my nozzle.

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:21.644
Want some gas, Jon?
I got your gas.

01:30:21.686 --> 01:30:23.855
I got your gas right here, Jon.

01:30:24.522 --> 01:30:26.627
Jon Peters' Ferrari...

01:30:57.684 --> 01:30:58.791
No.

01:30:59.191 --> 01:31:00.419
Come on.

01:31:00.461 --> 01:31:01.794
Oh, no.

01:31:03.725 --> 01:31:04.830
Where are we?

01:31:05.661 --> 01:31:07.827
I don't know.

01:31:07.869 --> 01:31:10.861
No, no, no, we ran out of gas.
You have to push the truck.

01:31:10.903 --> 01:31:12.363
The fuck are you staring at?
Push the truck.

01:31:12.405 --> 01:31:13.542
What are you doing?

01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:24.410
Get in.

01:32:34.649 --> 01:32:35.657
Hold on.

01:33:07.085 --> 01:33:08.783
If we get lucky
and make the light at Ventura,

01:33:08.825 --> 01:33:11.279
I think I can make a right
and get us to the 76 station.

01:33:11.321 --> 01:33:13.695
If you make the left,
the Mobil station's closer.

01:33:33.272 --> 01:33:34.734
I'm gonna blow this stop sign.

01:33:34.776 --> 01:33:35.882
I trust you.

01:33:52.565 --> 01:33:54.526
Oh!

01:33:54.568 --> 01:33:58.363
Oh, my...
Alana! Hard! Core!

01:33:58.405 --> 01:34:00.259
Hardcore, Alana!

01:34:00.301 --> 01:34:02.701
Fellas, you okay back there?
You okay?

01:34:02.743 --> 01:34:05.000
Oh, my... We did it!
We... You...

01:34:05.042 --> 01:34:08.206
Alana, you did it. I...
We did it!

01:34:08.248 --> 01:34:09.375
Oh!

01:34:09.417 --> 01:34:11.313
How did we survive?

01:34:44.682 --> 01:34:45.754
What the...

01:34:48.617 --> 01:34:51.089
It's a goddamn newsstand
in the middle of fucking...

01:34:59.867 --> 01:35:01.528
Yeah, you fucking...
Yeah, that's right.

01:35:09.978 --> 01:35:11.064
Did you hear that
whole thing that went down

01:35:11.106 --> 01:35:12.432
with that other instructor

01:35:12.474 --> 01:35:14.001
at the courts the other day?
It was, like...

01:35:14.043 --> 01:35:15.434
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:35:15.476 --> 01:35:16.772
Do you like
peanut butter sandwiches?

01:35:16.814 --> 01:35:18.271
Peanut butter?

01:35:18.313 --> 01:35:19.942
- Not really. No.
- No?

01:35:19.984 --> 01:35:21.613
Like,
creamy or nutty?

01:35:21.655 --> 01:35:22.974
However you like it.

01:35:23.016 --> 01:35:24.948
I like it a bit nutty.

01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:26.616
Who's got
the better backhand?

01:35:27.994 --> 01:35:29.521
You do.
No, you have the serve.

01:35:29.563 --> 01:35:30.749
You have a bigger serve.

01:35:30.791 --> 01:35:32.460
- She's got a good ground game?
- Yeah.

01:35:47.584 --> 01:35:48.966
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Brian?

01:35:49.008 --> 01:35:50.016
<i>Yes?</i>

01:35:50.815 --> 01:35:52.811
Hi, it's Alana Kane.

01:35:52.853 --> 01:35:54.215
<i>Drive their own cars...</i>

01:35:54.257 --> 01:35:55.417
Alana.

01:35:56.249 --> 01:35:59.311
Wow. Hi. How are you?

01:35:59.353 --> 01:36:00.815
<i>I'm good. How are you?</i>

01:36:00.857 --> 01:36:02.325
I'm doing fine.

01:36:03.157 --> 01:36:04.162
What are you doing?

01:36:04.925 --> 01:36:06.197
Not much.

01:36:08.103 --> 01:36:11.169
I was calling to see if you
still work for Joel Wachs?

01:36:11.868 --> 01:36:13.962
<i>Yes, I sure do.</i>

01:36:14.004 --> 01:36:15.767
Well, do you need volunteers?

01:36:16.378 --> 01:36:17.846
<i>We always do.</i>

01:36:18.875 --> 01:36:20.046
<i>Do you mean you?</i>

01:36:21.447 --> 01:36:22.510
Yes.

01:36:23.879 --> 01:36:25.341
<i>Alana...</i>

01:36:25.383 --> 01:36:28.506
<i>please come and work with us.
We need you.</i>

01:36:28.548 --> 01:36:29.816
I've seen how
you do your homework.

01:36:29.858 --> 01:36:32.180
<i>Oh, my God,
you remember that?</i>

01:36:32.222 --> 01:36:34.390
Yes, of course.
How could I forget?

01:36:35.726 --> 01:36:36.865
We need you.

01:36:57.980 --> 01:36:59.003
Alana.

01:36:59.045 --> 01:37:00.615
Hi.

01:37:00.657 --> 01:37:02.111
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

01:37:02.153 --> 01:37:03.307
I'm good.
Good, it's good to see you.

01:37:03.349 --> 01:37:04.377
Good to see you, too.

01:37:04.419 --> 01:37:05.551
Let me introduce you
to everybody.

01:37:05.593 --> 01:37:07.214
Welcome to our campaign.

01:37:07.256 --> 01:37:08.389
I'm just gonna
give this to you.

01:37:08.431 --> 01:37:09.953
Tess, this is Alana...

01:37:09.995 --> 01:37:11.220
- Hi.
- ...our newest volunteer.

01:37:11.262 --> 01:37:13.386
- Nice to meet you.
- Over here is Elizabeth.

01:37:13.428 --> 01:37:14.893
We have Richard.
They're in a meeting.

01:37:14.935 --> 01:37:17.293
We have Spencer,
Chuck's on the phone.

01:37:17.335 --> 01:37:20.401
Let me introduce you.
Hey, Ted. Ah, he's busy.

01:37:20.443 --> 01:37:21.629
Don't worry about it.

01:37:21.671 --> 01:37:23.063
So, here's where we're gonna
be spending most of our time.

01:37:23.105 --> 01:37:24.466
We're making phone calls.

01:37:24.508 --> 01:37:26.573
Joel, you're the youngest
councilman in the city,

01:37:26.615 --> 01:37:28.236
you're also its only bachelor.

01:37:28.278 --> 01:37:29.541
- Yes.
- How do you find time

01:37:29.583 --> 01:37:31.207
for a social life?

01:37:31.249 --> 01:37:32.909
Being single means
I have more time to work,

01:37:32.951 --> 01:37:34.574
and a councilman's schedule

01:37:34.616 --> 01:37:36.849
pretty much ruins
the social life anyways, so...

01:37:36.891 --> 01:37:38.752
What do your dates
say about that?

01:37:38.794 --> 01:37:40.246
They're not
saying anything.

01:37:40.288 --> 01:37:42.247
I'm not going on any dates.

01:37:42.289 --> 01:37:43.747
As you can imagine,

01:37:43.789 --> 01:37:45.049
it's probably pretty difficult
for somebody

01:37:45.091 --> 01:37:46.992
to be a part of all the social
events that I'm a part of.

01:37:47.034 --> 01:37:48.427
You know,
keep up with my busy schedule.

01:37:48.469 --> 01:37:49.590
But, um...

01:37:49.632 --> 01:37:52.096
I imagine someday soon
somebody's gonna come along

01:37:52.138 --> 01:37:54.559
who'll wanna share that
with me, so...

01:37:54.601 --> 01:37:56.498
Certainly you have
some prospects?

01:37:56.540 --> 01:37:58.101
I can't tell you
how many times I've heard,

01:37:58.143 --> 01:37:59.769
"Boy, have I got
the girl for you."

01:37:59.811 --> 01:38:03.040
And I've met some pretty magnificent
women through my district residents.

01:38:03.082 --> 01:38:04.440
But I'll tell you
what I tell them,

01:38:04.482 --> 01:38:07.615
and that's, "I'm sorry
but my time is spoken for."

01:38:08.383 --> 01:38:10.412
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you.

01:38:10.454 --> 01:38:11.609
Let's get
one photo for the paper,

01:38:11.651 --> 01:38:12.785
if you don't mind,
Councilman Wachs.

01:38:12.827 --> 01:38:15.086
- It's "Wachs."
- Wachs. Wachs.

01:38:15.128 --> 01:38:17.519
If you don't mind,
let's have you... Yeah.

01:38:17.561 --> 01:38:19.190
Let's have you stand with
your mother over here, yeah?

01:38:19.232 --> 01:38:21.085
Have a nice little picture
of you guys, and...

01:38:21.127 --> 01:38:23.128
- For sure.
- Since you're doing so much

01:38:23.170 --> 01:38:24.965
for his campaign.

01:38:25.007 --> 01:38:26.233
There you go.
Put your hand...

01:38:26.275 --> 01:38:28.266
Why don't you put your hand on
her shoulder? And then, ma'am,

01:38:28.308 --> 01:38:29.870
- if you grab the telephone...
- Councilman?

01:38:29.912 --> 01:38:31.272
- Yes?
- We'll handle it, sir.

01:38:31.314 --> 01:38:33.135
Wanted to introduce you to a
friend of mine. This is Alana Kane.

01:38:33.177 --> 01:38:34.270
- She's a volunteer.
- Oh, hey.

01:38:34.312 --> 01:38:35.369
- Oh, volunteer. Wow.
- Hi. It's an honor

01:38:35.411 --> 01:38:36.605
- to meet you.
- Wow, what a pleasure.

01:38:36.647 --> 01:38:37.642
No, I'm honored to meet you.
Thank you for coming on board.

01:38:37.684 --> 01:38:39.303
I have integrity.

01:38:39.345 --> 01:38:40.480
Me too.

01:38:40.522 --> 01:38:42.111
- I know.
- Honest.

01:38:42.153 --> 01:38:43.486
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm. I'm that too.

01:38:44.688 --> 01:38:49.483
This is public land which
the state bought for $34,000

01:38:49.525 --> 01:38:51.654
when everyone knew
it was worth millions.

01:38:51.696 --> 01:38:54.989
Sam Yorty and his cronies would
gladly destroy this beautiful

01:38:55.031 --> 01:39:00.834
225,000 square acre mountain chain
for favors, payoffs, and ugly houses

01:39:00.876 --> 01:39:03.001
that only their friends
can afford.

01:39:03.043 --> 01:39:05.631
But it needn't be that way,
you see.

01:39:05.673 --> 01:39:07.799
I understand it's crazy,

01:39:07.841 --> 01:39:09.743
and everybody's talking
about a revolution,

01:39:09.785 --> 01:39:12.013
but it doesn't have to be that.

01:39:12.055 --> 01:39:15.347
All that we need are people
in positions of power

01:39:15.389 --> 01:39:18.981
to remember to be who they were
when they were voted in.

01:39:19.023 --> 01:39:20.814
And cut. That was great.

01:39:20.856 --> 01:39:22.585
- I think that was the one.
- That felt really good.

01:39:22.627 --> 01:39:23.853
- Yeah, I mean, that was terrific, Joel.
- It was great.

01:39:23.895 --> 01:39:25.396
It did.

01:39:38.372 --> 01:39:39.770
You ready? We good?

01:39:39.812 --> 01:39:41.035
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:39:42.314 --> 01:39:43.968
What would you say
to the people that think

01:39:44.010 --> 01:39:46.873
you're too young and don't
have enough experience?

01:39:46.915 --> 01:39:48.880
I would say, "Thank you
very much for the compliment."

01:39:48.922 --> 01:39:50.017
Sorry, sorry, just...

01:39:50.059 --> 01:39:51.587
Can you say that again?
We didn't get that.

01:39:53.529 --> 01:39:54.555
Really?

01:39:54.597 --> 01:39:56.286
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:39:56.328 --> 01:39:58.383
Sorry, Councilman.

01:39:58.425 --> 01:40:00.101
Everybody rolling? Good?

01:40:01.438 --> 01:40:02.433
One more time.

01:40:03.363 --> 01:40:05.130
<i>So, Councilman,</i>

01:40:05.172 --> 01:40:06.893
what would you say
to the people that say,

01:40:06.935 --> 01:40:09.566
"You're too young and don't
have enough experience"?

01:40:09.608 --> 01:40:11.937
I would say, "Thank you
very much for the compliment."

01:40:12.681 --> 01:40:13.939
The way I look at it...

01:40:15.083 --> 01:40:16.406
I'm sorry.
Are you rolling? Did you...

01:40:16.448 --> 01:40:18.578
- Are you rolling?
- I think we rolled out.

01:40:20.023 --> 01:40:21.714
We're gonna need to take five.
I'm so sorry.

01:40:21.756 --> 01:40:23.975
It's okay. It's okay.

01:40:24.017 --> 01:40:25.919
So, Joel, don't forget,
tomorrow we got that

01:40:25.961 --> 01:40:27.483
Toluca Lake neighborhood
council thing.

01:40:27.525 --> 01:40:28.655
- Yeah.
- They'd love you there at 10,

01:40:28.697 --> 01:40:29.716
if you can get there.

01:40:29.758 --> 01:40:30.822
What's been going on
with the pinball?

01:40:30.864 --> 01:40:31.892
Art's calling me...

01:40:31.934 --> 01:40:32.992
Did you hear about
Judge Sachs?

01:40:33.034 --> 01:40:34.094
- I did, yeah.
- It's over.

01:40:34.136 --> 01:40:35.592
He lost five games to nothing.
So that's done.

01:40:35.634 --> 01:40:37.590
- That's it?
- Pinball will be legal again

01:40:37.632 --> 01:40:39.265
in LA for
the first time since...

01:40:39.307 --> 01:40:41.100
- Wow
- It's been illegal since 1939.

01:40:41.142 --> 01:40:43.002
- Can you believe it?
- I can believe it.

01:40:43.044 --> 01:40:44.502
It's an outmoded
discriminatory law

01:40:44.544 --> 01:40:46.507
in the first place so,
of course it took this long.

01:40:46.549 --> 01:40:49.701
If I'm gonna call Art, I need to
know 100% that this thing is passing.

01:40:49.743 --> 01:40:50.769
Oh, it's passing.
It's done.

01:40:50.811 --> 01:40:52.072
I talked to all my people
with the court.

01:40:52.114 --> 01:40:53.177
It's over.

01:40:53.219 --> 01:40:55.012
- Decision comes out tomorrow.
- Good.

01:40:56.552 --> 01:40:59.278
Yes,
it's Gary Valentine.

01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:03.494
I started a new company, and, um,
I'm looking for some pinball machines.

01:41:07.832 --> 01:41:08.829
No?

01:41:09.163 --> 01:41:11.124
Okay.

01:41:11.166 --> 01:41:13.600
Well, thank you for picking up my call.
Have a good day, Jimmy.

01:41:18.311 --> 01:41:20.071
Are you doing what I think
you're doing?

01:41:22.510 --> 01:41:24.276
What do you think I'm doing?

01:41:24.318 --> 01:41:26.484
Calling people
about pinball machines.

01:41:27.921 --> 01:41:29.256
That's what I'm doing.

01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:32.358
Because?

01:41:33.824 --> 01:41:36.652
Because we could be the first
place open that has them.

01:41:36.694 --> 01:41:39.530
Because we could start
"Fat Bernie's Pinball Palace."

01:41:40.531 --> 01:41:42.121
You know, we spent the day
with a great man

01:41:42.163 --> 01:41:44.823
who's really trying to make
a change on how this city runs,

01:41:44.865 --> 01:41:46.396
and the only thing
you fucking heard was,

01:41:46.438 --> 01:41:48.659
"Pinball machines
are about to be legal."

01:41:48.701 --> 01:41:50.395
I heard other things, too.

01:41:56.885 --> 01:42:00.180
Yello. Gary Valentine here.

01:42:00.222 --> 01:42:02.408
Don, thank you for
calling me back so swiftly.

01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:03.684
"Swiftly"?

01:42:03.726 --> 01:42:05.721
- Who are you?
- Yes.

01:42:06.121 --> 01:42:08.015
Yes.

01:42:08.057 --> 01:42:10.521
Is there a time that's convenient for
you, within your plans,

01:42:10.563 --> 01:42:12.150
that I could come lay
some eyes on the equipment?

01:42:12.192 --> 01:42:16.860
- Give me a fucking break, Gary.
- Great. Great.

01:42:16.902 --> 01:42:20.591
I'm 10 minutes away, I'll be right over.
Thank you so much, Don.

01:42:20.633 --> 01:42:21.827
I'm not driving you.

01:42:21.869 --> 01:42:24.295
That's great news
'cause I can drive myself.

01:42:24.337 --> 01:42:25.368
Hmm.

01:42:25.410 --> 01:42:27.871
You're gonna go on your own?
Big man.

01:42:27.913 --> 01:42:29.074
Yes, I am.

01:42:33.656 --> 01:42:37.654
You smoke those cigarettes,
you're gonna throw up like a little bitch.

01:42:41.158 --> 01:42:42.230
These cigarettes?

01:42:42.930 --> 01:42:44.232
These ones right here?

01:42:45.427 --> 01:42:47.235
"King size Mayburn."

01:42:52.602 --> 01:42:54.242
You don't have
the balls.

01:43:18.592 --> 01:43:20.631
I'm cooler than you.

01:43:21.099 --> 01:43:23.189
Don't forget it.

01:43:23.231 --> 01:43:25.857
I don't need you to tell me
whether I'm cool or not, old lady.

01:43:25.899 --> 01:43:27.926
- What was that?
- I said "milady."

01:43:27.968 --> 01:43:29.332
- I said "milady."
- What was that, then?

01:43:29.374 --> 01:43:30.601
- What was that?
- "My lady."

01:43:30.643 --> 01:43:33.545
I don't need you to tell me
whether I'm cool or not.

01:43:34.942 --> 01:43:38.209
You're not cool,
and your breath smells.

01:43:40.787 --> 01:43:41.784
Says you.

01:43:42.450 --> 01:43:43.555
And you're old.

01:43:45.484 --> 01:43:46.657
I'm old?

01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:49.956
I don't know what's cool?

01:43:49.998 --> 01:43:52.333
Changing the world isn't cool?

01:43:53.298 --> 01:43:54.693
Go ask Brian if you're cool.

01:43:54.735 --> 01:43:55.732
I will.

01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:58.359
Who thinks you're cool, Gary?

01:43:58.401 --> 01:44:00.460
Your waterbed fans?

01:44:00.502 --> 01:44:02.475
Sue, Kirk, and Mark?

01:44:03.344 --> 01:44:05.801
I hang out with
more people than that.

01:44:05.843 --> 01:44:08.239
You don't even know
what's going on in the world.

01:44:09.616 --> 01:44:11.805
You think that the world
revolves around Gary Valentine

01:44:11.847 --> 01:44:13.473
and whatever stupid shit
you come up with.

01:44:13.515 --> 01:44:14.610
- It does.
- It doesn't.

01:44:14.652 --> 01:44:16.741
- It does.
- It doesn't. It's about more.

01:44:16.783 --> 01:44:18.301
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:19.232
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

01:44:19.294 --> 01:44:20.552
Alana, you would still
be taking pictures

01:44:20.594 --> 01:44:24.156
at my high school of children
if it wasn't for me.

01:44:29.370 --> 01:44:31.834
You're talking
about pinball machines...

01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:34.342
I'm a politician.

01:44:37.772 --> 01:44:39.710
I need to get my life together.

01:44:43.216 --> 01:44:45.175
So, get it together.

01:44:45.217 --> 01:44:46.681
Where are you going?

01:44:46.723 --> 01:44:47.949
I'm going out.

01:44:48.715 --> 01:44:50.556
Okay, I'll take you.

01:44:53.058 --> 01:44:56.221
Come on, you wanna go see these
stupid pinball machines or what?

01:44:58.057 --> 01:45:01.089
Gary, I'm gonna take you,
it's fine.

01:45:01.131 --> 01:45:02.370
Gary.

01:45:03.565 --> 01:45:05.856
What is your problem?

01:45:05.898 --> 01:45:07.694
Don't you get in that car.

01:45:07.736 --> 01:45:10.037
Don't you fucking
get in that car.

01:45:11.237 --> 01:45:14.108
Gary fucking Valentine,
if you get in that...

01:45:14.150 --> 01:45:16.206
I will never
speak to you ever again.

01:45:26.322 --> 01:45:27.758
Just stop.

01:45:55.752 --> 01:45:57.384
Good morning.
This is Alana Kane

01:45:57.426 --> 01:45:58.713
calling from Councilman
Joel Wachs' office.

01:45:58.755 --> 01:45:59.955
Am I catching you
at a good time?

01:46:02.429 --> 01:46:03.922
I'm calling to ask
if you've heard

01:46:03.964 --> 01:46:06.291
of the councilman's efforts to
reduce corruption in our local...

01:46:07.970 --> 01:46:09.470
Well, fuck you, then.

01:46:14.068 --> 01:46:16.401
So, um, what's going on
with the analysis?

01:46:16.443 --> 01:46:18.169
Oh, yeah,
that's Len Barton's thing.

01:46:18.211 --> 01:46:20.097
They're small, but...

01:46:20.139 --> 01:46:21.606
Good morning.
This is Alana Kane

01:46:21.648 --> 01:46:22.836
calling from Councilman
Joel Wachs' office.

01:46:22.878 --> 01:46:24.375
Am I catching you
at a good time?

01:46:27.781 --> 01:46:28.873
Yes, I'm calling...

01:46:28.915 --> 01:46:30.074
- Alana.
- Oh, I'm so sorry,

01:46:30.116 --> 01:46:31.379
- I have to go.
- Oh, sorry about that.

01:46:31.421 --> 01:46:32.615
- Um...
- Sorry.

01:46:32.657 --> 01:46:33.786
Is it okay
if I tell you something?

01:46:33.828 --> 01:46:34.911
Yeah.

01:46:34.953 --> 01:46:37.721
Um, I've been known to be

01:46:37.763 --> 01:46:41.120
a little forgetful,
absent-minded, and, um...

01:46:41.162 --> 01:46:44.055
Look at me, I can't even
remember what I'm saying.

01:46:44.097 --> 01:46:45.355
But, ever since
you've gotten here,

01:46:45.397 --> 01:46:49.926
I've been very organized,
capable, and inspired.

01:46:49.968 --> 01:46:53.105
So, thank you for that.

01:46:53.147 --> 01:46:54.515
Thank you, Councilman.

01:46:55.180 --> 01:46:56.176
That's it.

01:47:15.095 --> 01:47:16.626
Good morning.
This is Alana Kane

01:47:16.668 --> 01:47:17.825
calling from
Joel Wachs' office.

01:47:17.867 --> 01:47:19.540
Am I catching you
at a good time?

01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:21.901
I'm calling to ask
if you've heard

01:47:21.943 --> 01:47:24.336
of the councilman's efforts to
reduce corruption in our local...

01:47:26.345 --> 01:47:28.043
Well, fuck you, then.

01:47:33.383 --> 01:47:36.250
Councilman Joel Wachs' office.
This is Alana. How may I help you?

01:47:36.292 --> 01:47:38.513
- <i>Hey, it's me.</i>
- Oh, hey.

01:47:38.555 --> 01:47:39.845
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:47:39.887 --> 01:47:42.318
Working. What are you doing?

01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:47.026
<i>Gary just came by and dropped off
a flier for his Pinball Palace.</i>

01:47:47.068 --> 01:47:48.989
What did he say?

01:47:49.031 --> 01:47:51.323
<i>Well, he wanted to see
if we would go.</i>

01:47:51.365 --> 01:47:54.034
<i>And he wanted to make sure
you knew about it.</i>

01:47:54.076 --> 01:47:55.466
What else did he say?

01:47:56.134 --> 01:47:57.974
<i>Well, I think he misses you.</i>

01:47:58.475 --> 01:48:00.174
He said that?

01:48:00.216 --> 01:48:03.243
<i>No, but he looked really sad.</i>

01:48:03.886 --> 01:48:05.080
<i>And sweet.</i>

01:48:05.978 --> 01:48:07.819
<i>He asked about Brian.</i>

01:48:09.484 --> 01:48:10.481
Hmm.

01:48:11.593 --> 01:48:14.549
<i>You should just go to
his pinball store.</i>

01:48:14.591 --> 01:48:16.013
I can't, I'm working.

01:48:16.055 --> 01:48:18.225
<i>But they have free Pepsi.</i>

01:48:18.893 --> 01:48:21.722
<i>And it's open till midnight.</i>

01:48:21.764 --> 01:48:23.723
- Pepsi...
- <i>There's a band.</i>

01:48:23.765 --> 01:48:25.192
Free Pepsi... Danielle,

01:48:25.234 --> 01:48:27.559
I'm eliminating state
property tax for the elderly,

01:48:27.601 --> 01:48:29.610
and saving the mountains,
and you're talking about free Pepsi.

01:48:30.775 --> 01:48:33.581
Brian, do you see
that guy over there?

01:48:36.612 --> 01:48:38.038
Number 12 guy?

01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:40.810
Yeah. I think
he's spying on us.

01:48:40.852 --> 01:48:42.953
He keeps looking over here
like a creep.

01:48:44.688 --> 01:48:46.253
He doesn't look weird to you?

01:48:48.789 --> 01:48:50.256
He does a little.

01:48:50.298 --> 01:48:52.422
He's been there all morning.

01:48:52.464 --> 01:48:54.129
Go say something to him.

01:48:54.795 --> 01:48:56.597
Just leave him.

01:48:56.639 --> 01:48:58.598
If he stays there too long,
I'll say something.

01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:00.300
Yeah, you too. Thursday?

01:49:05.443 --> 01:49:06.647
Can I help you?

01:49:07.610 --> 01:49:08.814
I don't know.

01:49:09.647 --> 01:49:11.311
You're staring at our office.

01:49:12.388 --> 01:49:15.445
Yeah, my eyes need
someplace to go.

01:49:15.487 --> 01:49:16.822
What are you doing here?

01:49:17.787 --> 01:49:18.876
I'm waiting for my friend.

01:49:18.918 --> 01:49:20.122
Who's your friend?

01:49:21.327 --> 01:49:22.663
No one you'd know.

01:49:24.163 --> 01:49:25.690
Move it.

01:49:25.732 --> 01:49:27.918
Away from our office.
Go down the street.

01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:29.591
Well...

01:49:29.633 --> 01:49:31.798
This is a free country...

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:35.907
so why don't you just go on
back to your little office

01:49:37.644 --> 01:49:40.340
before I start
asking you questions.

01:49:41.645 --> 01:49:43.145
Is there a problem?

01:49:43.579 --> 01:49:45.015
Not from me.

01:49:46.013 --> 01:49:47.808
Why don't you get out of here?

01:49:47.850 --> 01:49:50.483
Hmm? Oh, yeah, I'm on my way.

01:49:50.525 --> 01:49:52.352
- What was he saying?
- I don't know.

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:01.658
- Fat Bernie's Pinball Palace.
- Tonight.

01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:02.703
Come out to the Pinball Palace.

01:50:03.936 --> 01:50:04.989
Come to Fat Bernie's

01:50:05.031 --> 01:50:07.130

<i>Kirk's gonna pick you up
after school.</i>

01:50:14.373 --> 01:50:16.001
Hand as many of these out
as you can.

01:50:16.043 --> 01:50:17.667
- Okay.
- Okay. I love you.

01:50:17.709 --> 01:50:20.446

01:50:33.225 --> 01:50:34.360
Fat Bernie's Pinball Palace.

We got <i>Fireball</i> at

01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:39.926
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:50:39.968 --> 01:50:42.161
- Hey, Kirk.
- Ladies.

01:50:42.203 --> 01:50:45.075
Hi, Gary.
Please step up over here.

01:50:47.746 --> 01:50:49.640
You have a dinner tonight, sir?

01:50:50.252 --> 01:50:51.870
I hope so. I hope so.

01:50:51.912 --> 01:50:53.278
That's great.

01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:54.986
Jacket. Mmm-hmm.

01:51:23.946 --> 01:51:27.579
Hey, hey, buddy, buddy, buddy.

01:51:27.621 --> 01:51:28.954
You're gonna break the machine.

01:51:32.357 --> 01:51:33.354
Hey.

01:51:33.922 --> 01:51:35.290
Hey, man, cool out.

01:51:36.356 --> 01:51:38.888
Hey, can you hear me?
Buddy, stop!

01:51:38.930 --> 01:51:41.296
Hey, I'm telling you
to fuck off, man.

01:51:51.975 --> 01:51:54.233
Okay. Okay, you're out of here.

01:51:54.275 --> 01:51:55.376
You're out of here.

01:52:01.282 --> 01:52:03.442
Come inside when
you're ready to be cool.

01:52:03.484 --> 01:52:06.417
What is this? What is this?

01:52:06.459 --> 01:52:07.520
Bikes to the side.

01:52:07.562 --> 01:52:08.789
Jack, Matty, bikes to the side.

01:52:08.831 --> 01:52:10.280
- They are on the side!
- Bikes to the side,

01:52:10.322 --> 01:52:11.931
you're blocking the entrance!

01:52:25.776 --> 01:52:26.946
Hand me that jacket.

01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:29.867
Here. Don't know whose it is.

01:52:29.909 --> 01:52:30.917
Yeah.

01:52:35.424 --> 01:52:36.681
I'm really glad you're here.

01:52:38.359 --> 01:52:39.453
I told you that?

01:52:40.824 --> 01:52:42.192
I'm glad I'm here, too.

01:53:01.948 --> 01:53:04.175
Councilman Wachs' office.
Alana speaking.

01:53:04.217 --> 01:53:06.511
<i>Oh, Alana,
I'm so glad I caught you.</i>

01:53:06.553 --> 01:53:07.638
Oh, hi, Councilman.

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:09.782
<i>Hi. I was wondering,
if you're not too busy,</i>

01:53:09.824 --> 01:53:12.222
<i>if you could come meet me
for a drink?</i>

01:53:13.953 --> 01:53:14.982
Me?

01:53:15.024 --> 01:53:17.288
<i>Yes, you. It'll be nice, right?</i>

01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:20.296
<i>We could have a quick drink,
I was thinking, Rive Gauche?</i>

01:53:21.061 --> 01:53:22.659
That sounds nice.

01:53:22.701 --> 01:53:25.094
<i>Just one small drink.</i>

01:53:25.136 --> 01:53:27.126
<i>I don't wanna keep you
too long, but, um,</i>

01:53:27.168 --> 01:53:29.797
<i>you should come straight away.</i>

01:53:29.839 --> 01:53:30.977
<i>It's important.</i>

01:53:31.875 --> 01:53:33.300
Right, straight away.

01:53:33.342 --> 01:53:34.703
<i>Thanks so much, Alana.
See you soon.</i>

01:53:34.745 --> 01:53:35.740
I'll see you soon.

01:53:38.379 --> 01:53:39.986
The councilman
forgot his wallet.

01:53:40.553 --> 01:53:42.054
- Again?
- Yeah.

01:53:44.526 --> 01:53:46.190
He's never gonna win, is he?

01:53:46.823 --> 01:53:47.928
What do you mean?

01:53:48.697 --> 01:53:51.849
He's a mess.
Forgets everything.

01:53:51.891 --> 01:53:54.786
If it's not his wallet,
it's his keys or his briefcase.

01:53:54.828 --> 01:53:57.062
I've gone to his house three
times to pick up paperwork.

01:53:57.104 --> 01:53:59.170
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
he's not gonna win.

01:54:01.675 --> 01:54:03.499
- I'll go with you.
- No.

01:54:03.541 --> 01:54:04.538
No.

01:54:05.543 --> 01:54:07.000
No.

01:54:07.042 --> 01:54:08.949
Just finish locking up.

01:54:09.745 --> 01:54:10.803
Okay.

01:54:10.845 --> 01:54:11.842
Found it.

01:54:15.556 --> 01:54:16.847
Guess I'll see you later?

01:54:18.118 --> 01:54:19.124
Sure.

01:54:19.957 --> 01:54:21.588
Wanna meet at Tarzana Bobs?

01:54:22.289 --> 01:54:24.129
Tarzana Bobs. Sounds good.

01:54:26.568 --> 01:54:28.562
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

01:54:38.945 --> 01:54:40.740
Stop playing.
Stop playing. Leave.

01:54:40.782 --> 01:54:43.501
- But I put my money...
- Leave. Leave.

01:54:43.543 --> 01:54:46.085
- But, I...
- I own the place. Leave.

01:55:00.502 --> 01:55:02.891
- Hello, Este.
- Hey.

01:55:02.933 --> 01:55:05.424
- Hey, Gary.
- Hey.

01:55:05.466 --> 01:55:07.962
This is really great.

01:55:08.004 --> 01:55:10.233
Someone did their toes.

01:55:10.275 --> 01:55:12.300
- I did do my toes.
- I like them. I like them.

01:55:12.342 --> 01:55:13.402
- I like them. I like them.
- Thank you.

01:55:13.444 --> 01:55:15.739
- Thank you for coming. Really.
- It's a big night.

01:55:15.781 --> 01:55:17.101
You ladies look great.

01:55:17.143 --> 01:55:18.282
Thank you.

01:55:20.515 --> 01:55:22.649
Did you get a chance to talk
with Alana?

01:55:27.025 --> 01:55:28.490
- Fuck!
- She gonna come?

01:55:37.596 --> 01:55:39.039
You know where
she works, right?

01:55:39.538 --> 01:55:40.535
Yeah.

01:55:47.847 --> 01:55:49.610
Are you telling me to go? I...

01:55:51.814 --> 01:55:52.811
Yeah.

01:55:57.985 --> 01:55:58.982
Go.

01:56:08.196 --> 01:56:09.630
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

01:56:25.348 --> 01:56:26.846
No, I spoke to her,
and I said,

01:56:26.888 --> 01:56:28.375
"No, it's not possible to do
that."

01:56:28.417 --> 01:56:29.642
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah?

01:56:29.684 --> 01:56:31.316
- And she was okay?
- Yeah, she was fine with it.

01:56:50.105 --> 01:56:51.111
Alana!

01:56:51.379 --> 01:56:52.376
Alana.

01:56:55.915 --> 01:56:56.967
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:56:57.009 --> 01:57:00.470
I wanna introduce you
to my old friend, Matthew.

01:57:00.512 --> 01:57:01.574
Oh, nice to meet you.

01:57:01.616 --> 01:57:02.749
- Nice to meet you.
- This is Alana.

01:57:02.791 --> 01:57:04.213
She works with me
on the campaign.

01:57:04.255 --> 01:57:05.685
She's been
such a terrific help.

01:57:05.727 --> 01:57:06.744
- Mmm-hmm.
- I...

01:57:06.786 --> 01:57:08.153
She helped make
those TV spots, actually.

01:57:08.195 --> 01:57:11.024
Yes. I helped with
the "Integrity" billboard.

01:57:11.066 --> 01:57:13.156
That and, like,
100 other things you've done.

01:57:13.198 --> 01:57:15.095
Don't be shy.

01:57:15.137 --> 01:57:17.260
Things come easily
when they matter so much.

01:57:17.302 --> 01:57:19.599
It's funny, we were
just talking about that.

01:57:19.641 --> 01:57:20.767
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:57:20.809 --> 01:57:22.000
- Madame.
- Hi.

01:57:22.042 --> 01:57:23.407
May I get
you something?

01:57:24.711 --> 01:57:26.399
Uh... A martini.

01:57:26.441 --> 01:57:28.540
Martini. Vodka or gin?

01:57:28.582 --> 01:57:30.440
Vodka-gin.

01:57:30.482 --> 01:57:32.774
Would you like
an olive or a lime with it?

01:57:32.816 --> 01:57:34.009
Yes.

01:57:34.051 --> 01:57:35.077
Yeah, madame.

01:57:35.119 --> 01:57:37.107
Why am I even staying in this?

01:57:37.149 --> 01:57:39.376
Did you have any
trouble, um, finding the place?

01:57:39.418 --> 01:57:40.449
- Oh, no.
- No?

01:57:40.491 --> 01:57:41.887
No, I come here all the time.

01:57:42.563 --> 01:57:44.387
That's good.

01:57:44.429 --> 01:57:46.421
And now, you're dragging
this poor girl into it.

01:57:46.463 --> 01:57:48.456
Can we please
just enjoy dessert?

01:57:48.498 --> 01:57:50.521
And settle down?
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:57:50.563 --> 01:57:52.095
Alana's got her drink coming.

01:57:53.467 --> 01:57:55.340
Is that your campaign slogan?

01:57:56.074 --> 01:57:57.433
"Everything is gonna be fine

01:57:57.475 --> 01:57:59.740
as long as no one finds out
who I really am."

01:58:03.013 --> 01:58:05.610
I'm dealing with so many
things that you don't understand.

01:58:05.652 --> 01:58:07.139
So tell me.

01:58:07.181 --> 01:58:09.449
Do you have any idea how
uncomfortable I am all day long?

01:58:09.491 --> 01:58:12.109
I can't understand.
No, because you don't tell me these things.

01:58:12.151 --> 01:58:16.088
The one time, the one time
that I wanna feel comfortable,

01:58:16.130 --> 01:58:17.748
you go out
and make me feel uncomfortable.

01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:19.657
I haven't done
anything to you, Joel.

01:58:19.699 --> 01:58:21.456
Okay.

01:58:21.498 --> 01:58:23.889
I didn't call this girl.
You called her.

01:58:23.931 --> 01:58:25.229
Okay, but you're upset
that I called her.

01:58:25.271 --> 01:58:27.161
Yes, I'm upset
because nothing is about me.

01:58:27.203 --> 01:58:28.333
Nothing is about us.

01:58:28.375 --> 01:58:29.599
Oh, yeah, I forget
who I'm dealing with here.

01:58:29.641 --> 01:58:31.602
"I'm Matthew Marshall,
and, uh, it's always about me."

01:58:31.644 --> 01:58:32.641
No.

01:58:33.307 --> 01:58:34.379
No, no, Joel.

01:58:35.513 --> 01:58:37.974
It's never about me,
and that's why I'm sad.

01:58:38.016 --> 01:58:39.010
Well, look...

01:58:40.153 --> 01:58:42.475
We're here,
we're having dinner.

01:58:42.517 --> 01:58:44.280
You asked me to come to dinner.

01:58:44.322 --> 01:58:46.610
I'm tired,
and I'm here at dinner.

01:58:46.652 --> 01:58:48.327
What more do you want from me?

01:58:49.654 --> 01:58:52.628
I want you to myself.

01:58:54.126 --> 01:58:56.731
Well, that's just not
how the world works, is it?

01:59:00.137 --> 01:59:01.868
I don't know.

01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:03.738
Well, then you need to grow up.

01:59:08.250 --> 01:59:10.973
There was a man hanging around
the office earlier,

01:59:11.015 --> 01:59:12.714
and he's here now.

01:59:14.855 --> 01:59:16.382
That's why I called.

01:59:16.424 --> 01:59:18.843
Um, you see, I don't think it's
wise for my personal life

01:59:18.885 --> 01:59:21.216
to distract from
what our first priority is.

01:59:21.258 --> 01:59:23.223
What is our first priority?

01:59:23.265 --> 01:59:25.949
Well, there's
the community, my campaign,

01:59:25.991 --> 01:59:27.491
and everything
that I'm working towards.

01:59:27.533 --> 01:59:29.489
Mmm-hmm. Yes, and that's that,
and this is dinner,

01:59:29.531 --> 01:59:31.527
so what are we working towards?

01:59:31.569 --> 01:59:34.163
So, Alana, you came
to meet me for a drink.

01:59:34.205 --> 01:59:35.466
Um, you were running late,

01:59:35.508 --> 01:59:37.300
and now, you're going
to be taking your boyfriend,

01:59:37.342 --> 01:59:39.037
Matthew, home.

01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:45.975
Is she gonna be taking
her boyfriend to his house,

01:59:46.017 --> 01:59:47.037
or to your house?

01:59:47.079 --> 01:59:48.312
Would you please
keep your voice down?

01:59:48.354 --> 01:59:50.422
She's going to be taking you
to your house.

01:59:52.124 --> 01:59:53.623
Are you gonna be coming there?

01:59:57.199 --> 02:00:00.822
Can we just discuss this
at another time? Please.

02:00:00.864 --> 02:00:02.428
Are you gonna come
to my house tonight, Joel?

02:00:02.470 --> 02:00:04.898
Can we please just
discuss this at another time?

02:00:06.239 --> 02:00:07.528
- Do you want me to...
- Can't...

02:00:07.570 --> 02:00:08.735
Do you want me
to wait up for you?

02:00:08.777 --> 02:00:10.442
No, Matthew.

02:00:11.608 --> 02:00:13.478
Thank you both for coming.

02:00:16.976 --> 02:00:19.544
Let's go
paint the town red.

02:00:19.586 --> 02:00:22.487
- So nice of you guys to...
- And black and blue.

02:00:46.842 --> 02:00:49.008
Thank you, Alana.
You're very sweet.

02:00:59.685 --> 02:01:01.328
Do you have a boyfriend?

02:01:03.962 --> 02:01:05.156
Yes and no.

02:01:06.526 --> 02:01:07.664
I don't know.

02:01:11.630 --> 02:01:12.966
Is he a shit?

02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:17.597
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:01:17.639 --> 02:01:19.643
They're all shits, aren't they?

02:01:24.476 --> 02:01:25.649
Aw...

02:01:33.389 --> 02:01:35.153
Thank you, sweetheart.

02:01:39.034 --> 02:01:41.225
You have
a very powerful feeling.

02:01:44.906 --> 02:01:46.373
Thank you, Matthew.

02:03:24.162 --> 02:03:26.127
You're very cool.
What do you play?

02:03:26.169 --> 02:03:27.262
Guitar.

02:03:27.304 --> 02:03:28.461
- Hey.
- Me, too.

02:03:28.503 --> 02:03:29.509
Where's Gary?

02:03:29.977 --> 02:03:31.104
Are you okay?

02:03:31.605 --> 02:03:32.677
Where's Gary?

02:03:33.607 --> 02:03:34.613
He left.

02:03:35.279 --> 02:03:36.305
Where'd he go?

02:03:36.347 --> 02:03:37.341
I don't know.

02:03:38.777 --> 02:03:43.448
Pop. Pop. Pop.

02:03:52.157 --> 02:03:53.992
Miss Alana.
Good evening.

02:03:54.034 --> 02:03:55.084
Is Gary here?

02:03:55.126 --> 02:03:57.459
No, Gary didn't
come in tonight.

02:03:57.501 --> 02:03:58.965
- You haven't seen him?
- No.

02:03:59.007 --> 02:04:00.199
Do you need some help?

02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:02.201
No, thank you, Henri.

02:05:15.616 --> 02:05:18.948
Oh, my God.

02:05:29.225 --> 02:05:33.592
Everyone, everyone!
May I have your attention, please?

02:05:33.634 --> 02:05:36.735
Let me introduce to you,
Mrs. Alana Valentine.

02:05:40.567 --> 02:05:41.564
Idiot.

02:05:59.487 --> 02:06:00.484
Hi.

02:06:03.656 --> 02:06:04.730
Hi.

02:06:11.501 --> 02:06:12.969
I love you, Gary.
