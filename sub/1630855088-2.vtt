00:10.885 --> 00:12.721
Kate, they want a briefing.

00:12.721 --> 00:15.098
I gotta go.
White House wants Hal to brief.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.641
Not me. You.

00:16.641 --> 00:20.228
The president is asking you to serve
as ambassador to the United Kingdom.

00:20.228 --> 00:23.398
<i>Gonna tell you something five people know.
We're gonna lose the vice president.</i>

00:23.398 --> 00:26.651
<i>So we need somebody else.
I have a few ideas, but one of them...</i>

00:26.651 --> 00:28.361
<i>I want you to check her out.</i>

00:28.361 --> 00:30.029
Welcome to London, Ambassador Wyler.

00:30.029 --> 00:32.073
You need to lean
into the Cinderella thing.

00:32.073 --> 00:34.534
I'm not Cinderella.
I'm here for 30 funerals.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.661
- Eidra Park.
CIA chief of station.

00:36.661 --> 00:39.873
We can't see markings, but looks like
the kind Iran's been stockpiling.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.375
- Means it's Iran.
- Means it's an Iranian boat.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.252
<i>Wasn't I sending you to Kabul?</i>

00:44.252 --> 00:47.172
- Ganon's trying to get rid of you.
- Know who you can't fire?

00:47.172 --> 00:48.840
- Cinderella.
Wow.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.592
Is Mr. Wyler leaving?

00:50.592 --> 00:52.635
He will get me on my feet...

00:53.636 --> 00:55.054
and then he will go.

00:55.054 --> 00:57.724
- You're getting divorced.
- No, we're not.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.642
Billie says you're good at this.

00:59.642 --> 01:02.062
And I'm good at this.
We can get her there.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.982
You're perfectly safe. This is very mild.
You'll be yourself in no time.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.530
Really good.
Oh, yeah, magic.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.241
Like that one there.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.703
I think we're done. We're good.

02:00.703 --> 02:02.872
Portraits with Mr. Wyler.

02:02.872 --> 02:05.917
Just a couple with you and Hal.
Little more formal.

02:05.917 --> 02:06.960
We said candids.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.629
- Yes.
- Which I have done. For over an hour.

02:09.629 --> 02:11.005
Just a couple more.

02:12.882 --> 02:13.842
Quickly.

02:14.717 --> 02:16.761
- He's nowhere.
- I'm so sorry.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.055
Look harder.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.643
Oh, uh, ma'am. Ma'am.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.728
I'm taking this dress off
for five minutes.

02:25.728 --> 02:29.149
I really wish you wouldn't.
Well, I'm going to.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.032
Free his hands.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.169
He's here.

02:59.512 --> 03:00.597
Ma'am?

03:01.180 --> 03:02.807
You should come with me.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.773
Did you call the RSO?

03:13.026 --> 03:15.403
Is that what they call it here,
the head of security?

03:15.403 --> 03:16.529
Yes.

03:18.364 --> 03:21.826
I realize it looks like he's slinking off
with a hot young thing,

03:21.826 --> 03:24.287
but Hal doesn't cheat. Something is wrong.

03:25.413 --> 03:28.416
I realize that is what women say
who have husbands who cheat.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.209
Mine for some reason does not.

03:30.209 --> 03:32.712
I've often wished he did.
It might have made things easier.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.505
You don't have to believe me,

03:34.505 --> 03:37.550
but if I were in your shoes,
I would find the RSO.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.018
Seal the grounds, please.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.283
- Miss Bassett.
- We need to check if the guard--

04:02.283 --> 04:05.703
- Yes, all right.
- We were fine...

04:05.703 --> 04:07.622
This isn't Charm School, right?

04:07.622 --> 04:09.540
- What?
- You would tell me.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.834
You think this is a training exercise?

04:11.834 --> 04:15.296
The ambassador and her husband didn't have
time to do the safety course at State.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.257
Maybe Chet asked you
to throw something together.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.176
One, the fact that State
does kidnapping drills is bullshit.

04:20.176 --> 04:23.263
They don't have the sac to hold people
long enough to simulate a real event.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.766
- And two--
- But you would tell me if it was a drill.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.185
I mean, I wouldn't.

04:29.185 --> 04:30.520
But this isn't one.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.900
We've got CCTV from outside the gate
that tracks the car down here to Culworth,

04:35.900 --> 04:38.069
but then they pull over
and ditch the license plate.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.988
We lose them at the next light.

04:39.988 --> 04:43.283
There's a parking facility at the end of
that block. Probably switched out the car.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.744
- Do we have cameras in that garage?
- We're getting surveillance footage.

04:46.744 --> 04:49.163
- So these are professionals.
- Yeah.

04:49.163 --> 04:52.542
The woman was cleared
as part of the stylist's crew,

04:52.542 --> 04:54.877
but the company doesn't have
a record of her.

04:54.877 --> 04:56.713
Driver doesn't show up anywhere at all.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.882
- We're gonna bring in MI5--
- I don't want to bring in MI5 just yet.

04:59.882 --> 05:04.304
- That'll just generate more hysteria.
- Ma'am, you said you had some names?

05:04.304 --> 05:06.014
Mr. Wyler's been taken before.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.224
Yeah. Hezbollah held him for a week.

05:08.224 --> 05:11.102
State has the name. I only know
the aliases, and they're out of date.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.271
There's an ISIL commander
who really does not like him.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.940
Let me write down the name.
Spelling is tricky.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.151
He's abducted Mr. Wyler before?

05:18.151 --> 05:20.111
Yeah, but Hal escaped.

05:20.111 --> 05:23.114
Made the guy feel like an idiot,
so he won't let it drop.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.830
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs,

05:30.830 --> 05:32.123
Mr. Rasoul Shahin.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.166
In Tehran.

05:38.254 --> 05:40.923
- Hi there.
- Hal, can you hear me?

05:40.923 --> 05:44.302
Yeah, was the hypodermic
absolutely necessary?

05:44.302 --> 05:46.387
- What?
<i>- They drugged me.</i>

05:47.096 --> 05:48.306
With a needle.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.559
- Please put my colleague back on.
- Sure.

05:53.811 --> 05:54.645
Yes?

05:54.645 --> 05:56.314
You drugged him?

05:56.314 --> 05:58.316
For operational security.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.860
It was supposed to be a casual approach.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.781
In a heavily guarded environment,
with no time to prepare.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.783
This is extremely unprofessional.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.993
My thoughts precisely.

06:08.993 --> 06:11.162
Put him back on.

06:14.123 --> 06:16.334
Hi. How's your day going?

06:17.877 --> 06:19.754
You have my deepest apologies.

06:20.338 --> 06:23.007
<i>These are operatives not of my choosing.</i>

06:23.007 --> 06:24.383
I'm getting that.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.553
I have Naziri's support in this,

06:27.553 --> 06:31.599
but Farhad Mashkour
and his band of doorstops

06:31.599 --> 06:33.434
remain impervious to reason.

06:33.434 --> 06:34.477
Rasoul.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.563
<i>This man is going to give you
some information.</i>

06:37.563 --> 06:39.273
<i>This is highly unusual,</i>

06:39.273 --> 06:42.860
and it's meant to communicate
our profound concern

06:42.860 --> 06:45.780
that the situation may grow catastrophic.

06:47.573 --> 06:48.699
How's your stomach?

06:49.909 --> 06:51.035
Very bad.

06:52.078 --> 06:56.541
Please assure me
you will make it clear to your people.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.168
Yeah, I will.

07:10.179 --> 07:12.140
Iran had nothing to do with the attack

07:12.140 --> 07:14.892
on the already incapacitated
British warship.

07:15.476 --> 07:16.644
To impress this upon you,

07:16.644 --> 07:19.522
I have been ordered,
by Deputy Minister Shahin

07:19.522 --> 07:20.857
to make a gesture.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.192
Over my strenuous objection.

07:23.192 --> 07:26.112
Over the objection also
of the IRGC Intelligence.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.989
It's controversial. I get that.

07:32.034 --> 07:36.372
The man
is retired U.S. General Bradford Symes.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.291
His home.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.251
His office.

07:41.043 --> 07:43.588
His daughter, studying at King's College.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.923
His arrival at Heathrow last evening.

07:46.507 --> 07:47.925
His hotel,

07:47.925 --> 07:51.012
whereupon emerging from
at precisely 7:45 this morning

07:51.012 --> 07:53.764
to meet his daughter for breakfast,
he was to be assassinated.

07:54.348 --> 07:55.475
By me.

07:57.518 --> 08:01.397
For his participation in the murder
of Quds Force Commander Qasem Soleimani.

08:02.106 --> 08:06.486
A retaliation wholly proportional,
and three years in meticulous planning,

08:06.486 --> 08:08.654
which I cannot now execute,

08:08.654 --> 08:10.865
because of the assumption
that Iran has engaged

08:10.865 --> 08:12.950
in a reckless act of war at sea.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.912
I'm sorry for your loss.

08:15.912 --> 08:21.292
Mr. Wyler, military action against Iran
will not be considered a retaliation.

08:21.292 --> 08:24.212
It will be seen as an unprovoked attack.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.172
Iran will then respond,

08:26.172 --> 08:28.841
as your country would
to an unprovoked attack,

08:28.841 --> 08:31.344
with every tool at our disposal.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.780
Sorry, sir. Visitors are not being allowed
at this time.

08:51.239 --> 08:55.576
- Uh, they may make an exception for me.
- I've worked at Winfield for eight years.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.662
I've learned
every American is exceptional.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.331
- A lot of action in there today, huh?
- Indeed.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.084
I'm the one they're looking for.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.628
Sir, we're so relieved.

09:05.628 --> 09:08.047
- Do we have a doctor?
- I don't need one.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.382
Sir, what can we get you?

09:09.382 --> 09:12.301
- Coffee, water and scotch.
- I don't love their coffee.

09:12.301 --> 09:13.636
Sit the fuck down.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.137
Doctor's on her way.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.724
- Where did they dose you?
- Uh...

09:20.893 --> 09:22.853
- Ow!
- Jesus fucking Christ.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.939
Well, if you don't stab it, it's fine.

09:24.939 --> 09:27.984
- Do they do banana bags here?
- Someone's gonna show up with a banana.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.735
It's an IV, with vitamins.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.445
- Good for a hangover.
- Let me check.

09:31.445 --> 09:33.364
- Does your head hurt?
- Hey.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.159
Hi.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.161
I'm okay.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.547
- Air-gapped?
- Yeah.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.508
- This is the only thing they gave you?
Yeah.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.218
We picked up the general and his daughter.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.596
We'll keep them at the embassy
until we get them on a plane.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.848
- Need someone on his house when he's back.
- Yeah.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.646
Howard will take down
a description of the operatives.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.440
We'd like to find them
before they disappear.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.650
It was a pull-aside. You can't.

10:09.650 --> 10:12.153
She won't waterboard them.
You gotta verify the story.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.904
They're probably feeding you
a load of shit.

10:13.904 --> 10:16.324
- Those the shoes he wore?
- Take off your shoes.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.909
If they're gonna bug the residence,
the shoes are not the way.

10:18.909 --> 10:23.289
- If it's disinformation, it's inefficient.
- Take off your shoes. Give them to him.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.583
We confirmed
Deputy Minister Shahin's in Tehran,

10:25.583 --> 10:27.585
- so if it was him--
- It was him.

10:27.585 --> 10:30.129
You have no idea who was
on the other end of that phone.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.380
Christ, Kate.

10:31.380 --> 10:34.091
I asked him how his stomach was,
he said it was awful.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.093
I think we're drifting.

10:39.972 --> 10:44.477
We got Shahin a GI surgery in Geneva
two years ago.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.187
He was genuinely grateful,

10:46.187 --> 10:49.148
but ask how his stomach is,
and without fail,

10:49.148 --> 10:51.025
he'll say it's worse than ever.

10:51.567 --> 10:55.321
They're terrified that British sailors
are gonna start washing up on their shore.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.031
They tried backchannels.

10:57.031 --> 11:00.034
They told the Swiss there's no way
they'd shoot at a British warship.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.702
But no one was buying, so...

11:02.578 --> 11:05.414
How do we know Shahin didn't have
five guys with guns pointed at his head?

11:05.414 --> 11:07.958
We don't.
That's why they're gonna investigate it.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.171
All right.

11:12.922 --> 11:13.798
Come on.

11:18.552 --> 11:21.263
If it's all right, we'd like to bring you
into the station tomorrow.

11:21.263 --> 11:22.473
- Sure.
- Sorry.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.642
It's an awkward pivot,
from you as a guest to--

11:24.642 --> 11:27.686
- Person of interest. Don't apologize.
- Go.

11:28.604 --> 11:29.605
Yeah.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.529
Nobody who was at the gate
during the breach is still here.

11:36.529 --> 11:39.490
We got guys on the roof, every door
to the house, all over the perimeter.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.950
Who hears about this?

11:40.950 --> 11:42.868
Until we vet it, no one.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.079
Not gonna whisper it up the chain?

11:45.079 --> 11:47.623
I don't whisper unverified information.

11:47.623 --> 11:51.460
- Makes me look like a dumb broad.
- Ma'am, I am so sorry.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.088
This is my fault.
We were rushing the photoshoot.

11:54.088 --> 11:58.008
- Security didn't have time to check--
- You should offer to resign.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.093
In writing.

12:02.346 --> 12:03.222
Of course.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.101
Oh, Jesus, look at your face.
Not a real one.

12:07.101 --> 12:11.522
You write it, I refuse to accept it.
Makes you look like a stand-up guy.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.401
- I would fire me.
- I would too.

12:31.459 --> 12:32.960
Get in bed.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.757
If Shahin was calling from Tehran,

13:19.757 --> 13:21.842
a lot of people were listening.

13:21.842 --> 13:23.177
Yep.

13:23.177 --> 13:26.847
Which means he had buy-in
from somebody with a lot of <i>wasta.</i>

13:27.723 --> 13:30.142
The guy who picked me up was not a fan.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.478
Shahin took a huge risk doing this.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.606
I told you it wasn't Iran.

13:36.732 --> 13:37.650
You did.

13:40.736 --> 13:43.405
The economy's a wreck.
They want us lifting sanctions.

13:43.405 --> 13:46.659
Neither an attack at sea
nor an abduction of an American diplomat--

13:46.659 --> 13:48.577
- It wasn't an abduction.
- Whatever it was.

13:48.577 --> 13:51.997
- It wasn't. It was a pull-aside.
- Yeah, well, with sedatives.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.458
- Short-acting.
- Sounds like an abduction.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.460
But if you call it that,
all hell breaks loose.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.546
It's the opposite of what Shahin's
trying to achieve.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.422
Shouldn't have stabbed you in the neck.

14:00.422 --> 14:03.008
Shahin agrees. He was upset.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.469
Tell him to fuck himself. I was upset.

14:06.845 --> 14:07.972
You were worried?

14:09.056 --> 14:11.058
Yeah. I was.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.812
- Should've planned it myself.
- You're funny.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.483
Did you call Shahin?

14:22.611 --> 14:23.571
No.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.322
You sure?

14:28.325 --> 14:29.743
- Yeah.
- If you did--

14:29.743 --> 14:31.745
- I didn't.
- If you freelance lob a call

14:31.745 --> 14:34.665
to a country with whom
we have no diplomatic relations...

14:34.665 --> 14:36.667
- I didn't.
- ...it's a federal offense.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.336
Neither of us
would work for the government again.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.964
Well, the pay is shit.
It might be worth it.

14:42.756 --> 14:43.883
I didn't call him.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.930
Why not? It's what I would have done.

14:49.930 --> 14:52.057
- No, you wouldn't.
- Maybe.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.392
It'd be a smart move.

14:53.392 --> 14:56.729
You think I'm that shallow,
you throw "smart" out there, I roll over?

14:56.729 --> 14:59.690
You are absolutely that shallow.

15:01.191 --> 15:02.902
I didn't call Shahin.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.912
- Stay.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.082
Get some sleep.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.128
Get a little sorry-you-were-abducted sex?

15:23.088 --> 15:24.673
It wasn't an abduction.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.125
Do we need to have a conversation?

16:02.461 --> 16:04.546
- About what?
- Cairo.

16:04.546 --> 16:05.881
Taking it up a notch.

16:05.881 --> 16:09.468
You said no. I think
that's the end of the conversation.

16:09.468 --> 16:12.054
It wasn't a blanket no.

16:12.763 --> 16:15.432
- It's just not a great time.
- Yeah. I got it.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.691
We're supposed to go
to Brize Norton tomorrow.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.275
Meeting the caskets?

16:25.275 --> 16:26.652
Looks shitty to bail,

16:26.652 --> 16:29.863
but I don't want her out of the embassy
until we know what happened.

16:29.863 --> 16:31.490
She's gonna be bubble-wrapped.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.951
Double the security, twice as visible.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.578
And she's going to a military base.
It's totally safe.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.038
That's what we said about Winfield.

16:38.038 --> 16:41.291
You are not responsible
for a security breach at Winfield.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.044
- Okay.
- You're not.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.964
Security had to clear too many people
in not enough time.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.048
It's your job to ask.

16:48.048 --> 16:50.759
If they can't handle it,
it's their job to say no.

17:00.936 --> 17:01.937
Morning, sir.

17:11.447 --> 17:12.656
Good morning, Mr. Hayford.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.408
- Good morning.
- May I take your coat?

17:14.408 --> 17:16.452
Oh, I'm good. We're gonna head out soon.

17:20.831 --> 17:22.332
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.465
- Good morning, Ms. Park.
- Good morning.

17:30.632 --> 17:31.633
Hello.

17:31.633 --> 17:32.968
And hello to you.

17:37.347 --> 17:38.557
Do we know anything?

17:38.557 --> 17:40.976
We know Rasoul Shahin was in Tehran.

17:40.976 --> 17:44.646
Sources tell us that revenge
for Soleimani is a live issue.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.107
They were waiting for the right time,

17:47.107 --> 17:48.692
which yesterday would've been,

17:48.692 --> 17:50.736
had it not been on the heels
of the carrier attack.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.821
- Has this gone to State?
- Not yet.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.364
They have to vet it. Thoroughly.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.784
I say that, he never believes me.

17:56.784 --> 18:00.162
There's a guy at the embassy in Beirut
who can speak to Shahin's relationship

18:00.162 --> 18:02.498
with the Supreme National
Security Council.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.792
Verify that this is information he'd have.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.002
I'll call him
as soon as we get to the office.

18:07.002 --> 18:10.047
- You're going straight to Brize Norton.
- Shit. Okay.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.008
Anything from here?

18:13.884 --> 18:15.469
- Hmm?
Phone records?

18:16.136 --> 18:19.515
Someone helped a freelance
intelligence operative onto the property,

18:19.515 --> 18:21.016
with a horse sedative in her purse.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.644
That's Regional Security's area. Or FBI.

18:23.644 --> 18:27.439
Sure, but you'll have an easier time
getting a call list from GCHQ.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.900
- FBI's gonna get a run-around, right?
- Yeah.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.860
So maybe help them out.

18:31.860 --> 18:34.279
Good morning.
- Morning, sir.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.697
I wanna call Danny in Beirut,

18:35.697 --> 18:38.033
but I won't be at the embassy
till this afternoon.

18:38.033 --> 18:41.245
Is that something Mr. Wyler could do?
If it's someone you both know--

18:41.245 --> 18:44.706
This is a guy who can help confirm details
of Hal's story.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.166
You want Hal making the calls?

18:46.166 --> 18:48.669
The deputy minister's story
is what we're focused on.

18:48.669 --> 18:51.797
You should be treating Hal
like any other source.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.801
Ganon is gonna hate
that they approached you and not him.

18:55.801 --> 18:59.513
If this story's gonna hold,
we have to verify it with a third party.

19:00.430 --> 19:01.431
We should go.

19:04.601 --> 19:05.978
Ganon doesn't like him.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.229
At all.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.230
Noted.

19:10.941 --> 19:13.819
Howard will take you to the embassy,
talk through what happened.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.028
- My interrogator.
- Yes, sir.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.281
You're getting your own car and driver,
but until then...

19:17.281 --> 19:18.699
- You have me.
Your own car?

19:18.699 --> 19:20.033
I was kidnapped.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.660
I'm a high-value target.

19:27.207 --> 19:28.208
Excuse me.

19:29.084 --> 19:31.420
He goes to the embassy and back here.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.505
- Nowhere else.
- Just nod.

19:33.505 --> 19:34.756
Walk away.

19:38.635 --> 19:40.429
She likes to get involved.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.472
- She does.
- She knows she's not CIA, right?

19:42.472 --> 19:43.932
- Steady.
- It all happened fast,

19:43.932 --> 19:45.434
maybe nobody told her.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.585
The boat itself
is a 13-meter-long attack craft

20:11.585 --> 20:13.795
with a rocket strapped to its back.

20:13.795 --> 20:15.297
Lines up with what we've seen

20:15.297 --> 20:18.008
coming out
of the Shahid Mahallati Shipyard.

20:18.008 --> 20:21.345
You can spot there,
a flash coming off the fast boat.

20:21.345 --> 20:24.306
Probably a short-range anti-ship missile.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.390
Is this ours?

20:26.058 --> 20:27.142
India's.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.478
They had a satellite trolling for...

20:29.478 --> 20:31.438
- They won't tell.
- They won't.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.065
But it caught the launch.

20:33.065 --> 20:37.569
The Iranians have reverse-engineered
the Chinese 802 missile.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.238
That's probably what we're looking at.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.907
It'll have the Quds Force initials
on the side, if it's theirs.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.284
Thought they wrote "Death to Israel"
on the side.

20:44.284 --> 20:45.202
Room for both.

20:45.202 --> 20:49.414
We're still hunting for fragments.
We'll keep an eye out for all the above.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.750
If it's Iran
and they've signed their own missile,

20:51.750 --> 20:53.794
why bother with a denial?

20:53.794 --> 20:56.046
- Habit.
- Or it's not Iran.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.048
A counter-indication surfaced.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.592
If it's credible,
I'd love to share the news.

21:00.592 --> 21:03.720
Too raw to report,
but it came in through a credible source.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.681
As would any disinformation ploy.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.307
This one got my attention.

21:07.307 --> 21:10.477
It's under-baked, but if it holds up,
I'll bring it in.

21:10.477 --> 21:12.521
It quacks like a duck, Ms. Park.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.856
We must consider the possibility
it might be one.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.066
Is the duck Iran?

21:16.066 --> 21:19.236
The United States
commandeered an Iranian oil vessel,

21:19.236 --> 21:22.239
and they'd rather retaliate against us
than the Americans.

21:22.239 --> 21:25.033
- The duck is Iran.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

21:25.993 --> 21:26.827
Moving on.

21:33.875 --> 21:36.753
Shahin and I
worked on the Iran Deal together.

21:36.753 --> 21:38.255
He was your counterpart?

21:38.714 --> 21:41.550
Lot of time spent hanging out while
our principals talked past each other,

21:41.550 --> 21:44.886
in rooms we felt
would've benefited from our presence.

21:44.886 --> 21:47.806
- It's bonding.
- Has he done this before?

21:47.806 --> 21:49.349
Nothing like this, no.

21:49.349 --> 21:51.768
Tried to get a hotline going,
once upon a time,

21:51.768 --> 21:54.896
like the red phone with the Soviets.
Died on the vine.

21:56.690 --> 21:59.693
Uh, tell her the thing
about General Symes.

21:59.693 --> 22:02.362
I was saying
Iran doesn't assassinate people in London.

22:02.362 --> 22:04.239
- Karachi, maybe.
- London's unusual,

22:04.239 --> 22:05.991
but Symes is worth the risk.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.452
- Is he?
- No one knows who he is.

22:08.452 --> 22:11.246
He's not standing behind the president
when announcing a troop surge,

22:11.246 --> 22:13.457
but when they ask for three targets,

22:13.457 --> 22:16.126
Brad Symes
is the one who picks the targets.

22:17.210 --> 22:19.963
Tehran wants us to know
they're reading our e-mail.

22:19.963 --> 22:21.548
Mr. Wyler was also saying

22:21.548 --> 22:24.926
Quds Force likes using meteorological
metaphors when talking about an op.

22:24.926 --> 22:26.845
They're convinced it's vague,

22:26.845 --> 22:29.723
but they live in a place
where weather doesn't change a lot,

22:29.723 --> 22:31.141
so it jumps out.

22:35.353 --> 22:37.355
Hey, call NSA, see if they caught anything

22:37.355 --> 22:40.442
in Quds Force comms
about the weather last few days.

22:40.442 --> 22:42.736
Inconsistent with the actual weather.

23:02.047 --> 23:04.341
Do you want to use the facilities?

23:04.925 --> 23:07.719
Did Ambassador Vayle
need to be reminded to pee?

23:07.719 --> 23:09.888
- Absolutely.
- So good of you to come.

23:10.722 --> 23:11.681
Good to see you.

23:11.681 --> 23:15.018
- Ambassador Wyler.
- The foreign secretary's talking to you.

23:15.018 --> 23:17.229
- To me?
- Can I show you where you'll be?

23:17.229 --> 23:19.147
Yes.
- We want you both visible.

23:19.147 --> 23:21.983
A personal thanks
for lobbying the president on our behalf.

23:21.983 --> 23:26.238
I'm not sure a one-day moratorium
on American bluster merits thanks.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.739
It does.

23:27.739 --> 23:30.033
- Are you speaking?
- Here? No.

23:30.033 --> 23:32.244
- The PM is, actually.
- Oh, great.

23:32.786 --> 23:35.205
Yeah. Wordsmith.

23:35.205 --> 23:36.123
Excuse me.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.836
Cuts a figure, doesn't he?

23:42.003 --> 23:43.922
- Hmm?
- Pardon?

23:43.922 --> 23:46.591
- Sorry, I thought you were--
- Margaret Roylin.

23:46.591 --> 23:50.804
We nearly met yesterday
but you were abruptly needed elsewhere.

23:50.804 --> 23:51.972
Oh, God.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.390
Meg, among friends.

23:54.808 --> 23:55.934
Kate Wyler.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.145
You shouldn't, with all the cameras.

23:58.687 --> 24:00.772
Your deputy was not entirely wrong.

24:00.772 --> 24:03.650
I always find clasping hands
behind the back,

24:03.650 --> 24:07.028
along with a vague head tilt,
gets the job done.

24:07.028 --> 24:08.989
Polite but illegible.

24:09.739 --> 24:10.866
It really is.

24:11.783 --> 24:14.035
Your husband can reach me

24:14.035 --> 24:16.746
if there's anything I can do
to be of help.

24:16.746 --> 24:19.666
It'll be Christmas before you get
anything from this government

24:19.666 --> 24:23.336
beyond bromides so assiduously scrubbed
of meaning,

24:23.336 --> 24:25.714
you'll think you were hearing the wind.

24:26.256 --> 24:28.300
I'm prepared to interpret.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.510
Provide you with some background.

24:30.510 --> 24:33.180
- I thought you were...
- On the Naughty Step?

24:33.805 --> 24:35.599
They revile me in public,

24:35.599 --> 24:37.934
but I can't seem
to get them off my telephone.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.563
Very kind offer. Thank you.

24:41.563 --> 24:42.647
You should go in.

24:42.647 --> 24:44.566
They'll have a seat for you in the front.

24:44.566 --> 24:46.526
- Oh, I'd rather stand.
- You can't.

24:47.527 --> 24:50.113
You have a place. It means something.

24:50.113 --> 24:52.365
And fix your blouse.

24:58.747 --> 24:59.581
Ambassador.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.917
Yes. Coming.

26:41.474 --> 26:44.269
The men and women
aboard the mighty <i>Courageous</i>

26:45.478 --> 26:47.981
honored us with their service

26:49.190 --> 26:52.819
and defended us with their very lives.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.323
In their honor,

26:57.490 --> 27:01.119
in their defense,
we shall give no quarter.

27:02.746 --> 27:05.081
We shall not flag nor fail

27:06.124 --> 27:11.713
as we hunt down
the source of this barbaric attack.

27:15.508 --> 27:21.598
Let no man question our fortitude
or our fury.

27:23.391 --> 27:27.729
Our cowardly enemies
shall not rest between air and earth,

27:27.729 --> 27:29.731
but we shall find them.

27:31.274 --> 27:33.860
And justice shall be served.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.920
I'm so sorry for your loss.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.756
I'm sure you'll make
your father very proud.

27:57.008 --> 27:59.260
He's a fucking disgrace.

28:00.053 --> 28:02.055
- You're a disgrace.
Madam, please.

28:02.055 --> 28:06.476
You know who did it.
My husband was blown to bits.

28:06.476 --> 28:07.769
For goodness' sake.

28:07.769 --> 28:10.397
You know exactly who it is.

28:10.397 --> 28:12.565
It's shameful.
That's enough.

28:12.565 --> 28:16.027
It's all right. Leave her be.
She has a right to be angry.

28:16.027 --> 28:19.364
The Americans piss off Iran.
Two days later, this happens.

28:19.364 --> 28:22.909
- I understand, but--
- Iran murdered this child's father.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.996
You don't even have the spine
to say their name.

28:26.996 --> 28:32.627
I can assure you that I am sickened
and enraged by this brutal crime.

28:33.795 --> 28:34.921
And...

28:36.840 --> 28:40.844
If this was Tehran, then mark my words...

28:43.054 --> 28:44.848
I will rain hellfire upon them.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.751
- What the fuck happened?
You heard?

29:12.751 --> 29:16.129
- It's all over Twitter.
<i>I will rain hellfire.</i>

29:16.129 --> 29:18.548
<i>Hellfire.</i>

29:19.549 --> 29:22.010
Jesus Christ. Fucking great.

29:22.510 --> 29:23.511
Shit.

29:23.511 --> 29:26.306
Call State. Give them a heads up.
- About?

29:26.306 --> 29:30.268
My thing, Shahin. This guy's throwing
gasoline all over the fire.

29:30.268 --> 29:32.520
- Do you have enough to report?
- To State?

29:32.520 --> 29:35.315
We're getting there.
This is from Forensics.

29:35.315 --> 29:36.858
Preliminary.

29:37.525 --> 29:40.028
- If you're not done with it...
- No, I'm good.

29:40.028 --> 29:42.489
<i>Hellfire. Hellfire. Hellfire...</i>

29:44.741 --> 29:45.825
<i>Hellfire--</i>

29:50.330 --> 29:52.332
How are we doing
on the local investigation?

29:52.332 --> 29:54.918
You were gonna have the FBI
look into possible contact

29:54.918 --> 29:56.753
between the operatives and Winfield?

29:56.753 --> 29:58.755
I was speaking
to Ambassador Wyler earlier.

29:58.755 --> 29:59.714
Call him Hal.

29:59.714 --> 30:03.885
He rightly pointed out that treating
a diplomatic pull-aside like a felony

30:03.885 --> 30:06.262
- is a bad move.
- Did he?

30:06.262 --> 30:09.724
Ma'am, I understand you come here
with a great deal of experience

30:09.724 --> 30:12.769
collaborating with the CIA
in your previous posts.

30:13.269 --> 30:15.814
But you need to let me handle
the investigation.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.817
She's concerned
you're not sufficiently investigating me.

30:19.859 --> 30:21.361
You have my phone number.

30:21.361 --> 30:24.697
Did you get the NSA
to run a check on my phone records,

30:24.697 --> 30:27.200
make sure I didn't call Tehran myself?

30:28.159 --> 30:30.537
If you need to look at my text messages,

30:31.079 --> 30:35.416
- code's 5283. It spells "Kate."
- It's not necessary.

30:35.416 --> 30:37.460
- Yeah, it is.
Ma'am...

30:38.294 --> 30:39.921
I ran a check on his phone.

30:45.009 --> 30:47.345
I'm going back to my gracious home.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.477
The <i>Vogue</i> spread's online.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.065
Look how cute you are.

31:03.486 --> 31:05.113
Nobody's firing that gal.

31:10.910 --> 31:13.997
<i>Facing a distraught
mourner as he left the ceremony,</i>

31:13.997 --> 31:17.667
<i>Prime Minister Trowbridge
vowed to "rain hellfire" on Iran</i>

31:17.667 --> 31:22.088
<i>should the nation prove to be responsible
for the attack on the carrier.</i>

31:22.088 --> 31:25.258
<i>The PM appears to have met the moment.</i>

31:25.258 --> 31:28.845
<i>It's no secret that there are those,
even among his party,</i>

31:28.845 --> 31:33.349
<i>who have harbored doubts
about his fortitude, his resolve,</i>

31:33.349 --> 31:35.518
<i>about, frankly, his backbone.</i>

31:35.518 --> 31:37.395
<i>As in, did he possess one?</i>

31:37.395 --> 31:40.982
<i>He's resoundingly answered that
in the bellicose affirmative.</i>

31:40.982 --> 31:43.985
- He was a punch line. Now he's Churchill.
<i>- The country's finally seeing</i>

31:43.985 --> 31:45.528
<i>a bolder Trowbridge.</i>

31:45.528 --> 31:47.614
<i>But what about his party?</i>

31:47.614 --> 31:50.491
<i>In a moment,
we'll be joined by Will Johnston</i>

31:50.491 --> 31:53.036
<i>of the Hagan Institute for his thoughts--</i>

32:02.545 --> 32:03.922
- Fuck.
- What?

32:03.922 --> 32:07.383
Some asshole ran over a family
outside New Peckham Mosque screaming,

32:07.383 --> 32:09.719
-"Go back to Iran."
- Fuck.

32:23.399 --> 32:24.400
Morning, ma'am.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.735
- It was a car?
- A van.

32:26.569 --> 32:27.862
A family of four.

32:27.862 --> 32:29.280
- Ambassador.
- Ma'am.

32:29.280 --> 32:32.450
Mom was killed.
The other three are in the hospital.

32:33.868 --> 32:35.662
- Morning, ma'am.
Hello.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.997
Howard will brief you
on the attack at the mosque.

32:37.997 --> 32:40.583
I need to get on the phone with Langley,
feed some of the details

32:40.583 --> 32:42.543
of Mr. Wyler's encounter
into the pipeline.

32:43.044 --> 32:45.880
- Now?
- Yes, given the circumstances.

32:45.880 --> 32:49.759
The circumstances may be different.
That doesn't mean we have any facts.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.219
I think we have enough.

32:52.887 --> 32:56.140
- Where were you in 2003?
- Norway.

32:56.140 --> 32:59.560
I was watching Colin Powell
talk about aluminum tubes at the UN.

32:59.560 --> 33:03.481
And then me and 175,000 of my friends
invaded Iraq.

33:03.481 --> 33:06.359
I have pretty strong feelings
about undercooked intelligence.

33:06.359 --> 33:08.277
I'm not taking it to the press.

33:08.277 --> 33:12.699
Once you name Hal Wyler as your source,
this gets a life of its own.

33:12.699 --> 33:14.492
Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.

33:33.469 --> 33:34.637
Ma'am...

33:36.055 --> 33:39.559
It can't be easy having a spouse
that attracts that much attention.

33:40.435 --> 33:43.187
And the idea that in a crisis,
he was tapped--

33:43.187 --> 33:47.692
Are you concerned I'm jealous?
Of my husband's star power?

33:55.324 --> 33:58.786
Intelligence is a story.
Even she will tell you that.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.999
A story based on incomplete facts.

34:03.583 --> 34:07.211
Life or death decisions turn
on whether people buy the story.

34:07.211 --> 34:08.296
Sure.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.466
Some members of the administration

34:11.466 --> 34:17.346
have had mixed experiences with
jaw-dropping stories that come from Hal.

34:17.346 --> 34:21.017
- Just because Ganon doesn't--
- It's not just Ganon.

34:25.313 --> 34:29.317
Half of State will tell you
about Hal Wyler,

34:29.317 --> 34:33.362
bravely flying from Kabul
to Mazār-e Sharīf, middle of the night,

34:33.362 --> 34:38.910
convincing Taliban leadership to hold back
the seizure of Kabul by one more day.

34:40.495 --> 34:45.708
The other half will tell you he did that
by commandeering a plane

34:45.708 --> 34:50.004
that was meant to evacuate Afghans
who worked for U.S. forces.

34:51.422 --> 34:54.092
People we swore we'd protect.

34:55.384 --> 34:57.929
Three hundred and thirty-two people

34:57.929 --> 35:02.642
who didn't get on a plane because
Hal Wyler went to do something brave.

35:06.187 --> 35:10.817
A lot hinges on whether we believe this
is Iran or we believe it's someone else.

35:10.817 --> 35:14.695
When it's Hal,
you have to be really fucking sure.

35:18.866 --> 35:21.244
- Yeah?

35:22.578 --> 35:24.288
Sorry. Excuse me.

35:33.673 --> 35:34.882
Um...

35:39.428 --> 35:40.972
How's it going there, pal?

35:42.974 --> 35:44.183
The president's coming.

35:46.352 --> 35:47.854
Of the United States?

35:48.437 --> 35:52.608
- Ma'am. Ambassador Wyler.
- I'm taking a walk.

35:52.608 --> 35:55.736
- The ambassador would like to take a walk.
- I don't need a chaperone.

35:55.736 --> 35:58.823
Uh, Byron is suggesting this afternoon.

35:58.823 --> 36:01.242
Tell Byron to fuck himself in the face.

36:03.077 --> 36:05.079
Byron, I think she'd rather go now.

36:08.374 --> 36:09.625
<i>President Rayburn,</i>

36:09.625 --> 36:12.712
<i>on his way to his formally scheduled
two-day Berlin trip,</i>

36:12.712 --> 36:13.838
<i>will, and I quote,</i>

36:13.838 --> 36:17.341
"stop by" for a visit
with Prime Minister Trowbridge

36:17.341 --> 36:21.929
to express his solidarity in the wake
of the attack on the HMS <i>Courageous.</i>

36:22.430 --> 36:27.059
The president will spend 90 minutes
on the ground, 70 at Winfield.

36:28.227 --> 36:32.356
Most of his 800-person entourage
will remain on the planes at Heathrow,

36:32.356 --> 36:35.943
while Marine One brings the president
and a handful of lucky winners

36:35.943 --> 36:38.571
<i>to Winfield for lunch with the PM.</i>

36:38.571 --> 36:44.368
So, Don, Christine, Joanne, Paul,
we're talking to Heathrow in half an hour.

36:45.244 --> 36:47.038
<i>Ronnie, Bruce, Jen, and Mike,</i>

36:47.038 --> 36:50.499
<i>you'll liaise with the prime minister's
office about security en route.</i>

36:50.499 --> 36:52.126
<i>And Gary, where's Gary?</i>

36:52.126 --> 36:53.836
Gary. Is Gary here? Ah.

36:54.545 --> 36:56.756
This is gonna be the longest
70 minutes of your life.

36:57.465 --> 36:59.300
- I need to pee.
- Heading back.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.468
Badly.

37:01.719 --> 37:03.346
Ma'am, give me a moment.

37:16.525 --> 37:19.195
Sorry. Hello. Thank you.

37:21.405 --> 37:24.408
- Just through to the left, ma'am.
- Hello.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.177
<i>Hey.</i>
- Carole.

37:43.177 --> 37:47.306
Rodney says that you're in London.
Is that some kind of a joke?

37:48.015 --> 37:50.851
It is not a fucking joke. London, England.

37:58.401 --> 37:59.610
Should we check on her?

38:09.745 --> 38:12.623
Can you get into GCHQ from there,
or do you have to go through NSA?

38:12.623 --> 38:14.333
<i>Oh, give me a second.</i>

38:14.333 --> 38:16.544
Ma'am?
- I'm not done.

38:18.921 --> 38:22.508
- Everything all right?
- I could use some privacy. Thank you.

38:28.431 --> 38:31.517
- I'm gonna kill myself.
- They don't let you crap on your own?

38:31.517 --> 38:34.812
I'm in a deli. I had to get out
of the embassy cell tower range.

38:34.812 --> 38:37.481
Now they're worried
I'm having an aneurysm on the terlet.

38:37.481 --> 38:39.900
- This is gonna be a long tour for you.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

38:39.900 --> 38:42.611
We're in the phase
where everyone wants a selfie with Hal.

38:42.611 --> 38:44.196
It'll be easier when he's gone.

38:44.196 --> 38:46.574
Been hearing that one for a long time.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.326
This time it's true.

38:49.118 --> 38:50.870
Kabul tipped the scales.

38:50.870 --> 38:53.080
<i>- For real?</i>
- Yeah.

38:53.080 --> 38:56.042
Oh, honey. Well. Good for you.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.419
Good for me. You find anything?

38:58.419 --> 39:02.006
- You know what helps? When you rush me.
<i>- I'm sorry. You're pretty.</i>

39:02.006 --> 39:03.883
- You're the prettiest.
<i>- Better.</i>

39:03.883 --> 39:06.969
Okay, there was a call
from the zone in question,

39:07.595 --> 39:10.097
uh, the day of the approach.

39:10.598 --> 39:11.682
On a burner.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.851
A call to the belligerent nation?

39:13.851 --> 39:15.603
No. A call to Rome.

39:16.687 --> 39:17.521
Fuck.

39:20.983 --> 39:21.984
Mr. Hayford.

39:23.319 --> 39:24.904
- Hi.
<i>Are you okay?</i>

39:24.904 --> 39:26.697
Thanks. I went for a walk.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.616
<i>They're asking
if they should call an ambulance.</i>

39:28.616 --> 39:31.994
- No. Why are you calling an ambulance?
- It was 35 minutes.

39:31.994 --> 39:36.457
-<i>Is it maybe something you ate?</i>
- I need to see my husband right away.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.667
If you could have somebody
go to the residence.

39:38.667 --> 39:39.919
<i>He's here at the embassy,</i>

39:39.919 --> 39:43.506
<i>helping the folks down the hall
get in touch with a contact in Uzbekistan.</i>

39:44.006 --> 39:45.257
Of course he is.

40:05.444 --> 40:09.782
I'm not doing anything other than
trying to be helpful at the margins.

40:09.782 --> 40:11.409
Okay. Hey.

40:12.118 --> 40:13.035
What are you--?

40:18.124 --> 40:19.708
You called Niccolo.

40:20.584 --> 40:24.922
Do us both a stupendous favor
and don't waste time denying it.

40:26.924 --> 40:28.008
Yes.

40:28.008 --> 40:30.386
And he called Shahin.

40:31.053 --> 40:34.515
- To let him know we're here.
- I asked you 12 times.

40:34.515 --> 40:37.017
If I called Shahin, which I didn't.
Niccolo did.

40:37.017 --> 40:40.312
Italy has diplomatic relations with Iran.
No one will raise an eyebrow.

40:40.312 --> 40:42.565
It took me exactly one phone call.

40:42.565 --> 40:45.693
Only you know a call to an Italian
landscape architect from a burner

40:45.693 --> 40:47.570
in Regent's Park is a red flag.

40:47.570 --> 40:51.031
I didn't tell you because if it gets out,
I wanted you insulated.

40:51.031 --> 40:53.159
Meanwhile, it fucking paid off.

40:53.159 --> 40:56.829
You don't want the White House near it.
Now the president's on his way.

40:56.829 --> 40:58.080
I knew something was off.

40:58.080 --> 41:01.709
And I knew when a hot tip comes from you,
it cuts more than one way.

41:01.709 --> 41:04.128
No one knows how until they know,
but then--

41:04.128 --> 41:05.421
"They definitely know."

41:05.421 --> 41:07.923
Don't fucking act like it doesn't matter.

41:07.923 --> 41:10.009
Shahin put his neck on a rail.

41:10.009 --> 41:12.511
- We blow this, he'll get executed.
- Yeah.

41:12.511 --> 41:15.306
So. Now you know. I called Niccolo.

41:15.306 --> 41:18.017
He called Shahin,
or sent him a smoke signal, I don't know.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.018
That's the whole story.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.186
- Is it?
- Yeah.

41:23.189 --> 41:26.317
So... onward.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.361
- Oh, that's it?
Uh-huh.

41:29.361 --> 41:33.157
I just march out and say,
"Hey, I rethought it. Let's go wide."

41:33.157 --> 41:34.867
- Yeah.
- Based on what?

41:34.867 --> 41:39.288
My husband snuck out and called Iran?
And then lied to me about it?

41:39.288 --> 41:42.541
- How do you think that fucking looks?
- Who cares?

41:44.043 --> 41:47.338
I care! I am supposed to run this place.

41:47.338 --> 41:51.383
I was almost fired
by the secretary of state on day one.

41:51.383 --> 41:52.968
Hat tip, Hal Wyler.

41:52.968 --> 41:57.139
And day two, I'm a <i>Vogue</i> model
at the mercy of tidal hormones.

41:57.723 --> 42:01.644
Smart people listen to other smart people,
and change their minds.

42:01.644 --> 42:07.274
I told the chief of station
she was like Colin Powell selling WMD.

42:07.274 --> 42:10.986
My DCM thinks I'm so upset
you've eclipsed me,

42:10.986 --> 42:12.613
I actually shit my pants.

42:12.613 --> 42:14.823
Thanks to your intervention,

42:14.823 --> 42:18.494
I appear, to the two most important
colleagues I have in this mission...

42:18.494 --> 42:20.829
like a fucking psychotic!

42:30.047 --> 42:33.175
I'd like to speak
to the secretary of state, please.

42:37.638 --> 42:38.722
<i>Ambassador.</i>

42:38.722 --> 42:43.060
<i>Iranian denials haven't convinced since...
I'm trying to remember a time.</i>

42:43.060 --> 42:47.106
Calling off an assassination
is a not-insignificant gesture.

42:47.106 --> 42:48.440
<i>I find it very moving.</i>

42:48.440 --> 42:52.069
The source was compelling.
On both ends of the reach out.

42:52.069 --> 42:55.072
<i>- CIA is still vetting it.</i>
- That's my fault.

42:55.072 --> 42:57.074
It's why I contacted you myself.

42:57.074 --> 43:00.744
I'm hoping you can put
some stock in my word.

43:00.744 --> 43:04.373
<i>My wife says that</i> Vogue
<i>named you the future of diplomacy.</i>

43:04.373 --> 43:05.791
<i>So I'd better listen.</i>

43:07.918 --> 43:11.130
Sir. It was Hal.

43:12.673 --> 43:13.882
Wyler.

43:15.217 --> 43:16.385
<i>Jesus.</i>

43:16.385 --> 43:19.471
Knowing it might be greeted
with some skepticism,

43:19.471 --> 43:22.600
I asked them to dot all their I's
before they brought it to you.

43:23.267 --> 43:24.560
<i>Shit.</i>

43:24.560 --> 43:29.148
- Tell the president he shouldn't come.
-<i>Are you kidding?</i>

43:29.148 --> 43:32.067
The optics of him and Trowbridge
shoulder to shoulder

43:32.067 --> 43:33.569
after the hellfire rant--

43:33.569 --> 43:37.281
<i>The optics are that it looks like
the president is ready to march on Tehran.</i>

43:37.281 --> 43:41.869
<i>If your husband's right, 24 hours later,
we'll have to roll that all back.</i>

43:41.869 --> 43:44.121
<i>The optics of that are
he looks like an idiot.</i>

43:44.121 --> 43:45.831
<i>Around here, we call that Tuesday.</i>

43:45.831 --> 43:49.168
- Muslims are being attacked in the street.
<i>- Is that on me too?</i>

43:49.168 --> 43:52.463
<i>The president wanted to look like a hero,
throw his arm around the Brits,</i>

43:52.463 --> 43:54.423
<i>show everyone we're the ally we used to be</i>

43:54.423 --> 43:56.925
<i>before we lost interest
in the whole fucking world.</i>

43:56.925 --> 44:00.304
<i>That's my job, if it's anyone's.
But he wanted it, so he's got it.</i>

44:01.096 --> 44:04.892
Sir. I'm not sure "he made his bed,
now let's let him lie in it"

44:04.892 --> 44:07.061
is the best thing for global stability.

44:07.061 --> 44:10.022
<i>Canceling the trip,
that's good for global stability?</i>

44:10.856 --> 44:12.107
It's not ideal.

44:14.151 --> 44:17.488
<i>If you'd come to me
before we announced the visit, maybe.</i>

44:17.488 --> 44:19.782
<i>Now, it's too late.</i>

44:27.790 --> 44:30.000
They're for you. What did Ganon say?

44:31.001 --> 44:33.003
I need to talk to the foreign secretary.

44:33.837 --> 44:35.005
Ganon said that?

44:35.714 --> 44:37.591
No. I'm saying that.

44:38.634 --> 44:40.678
You'll see the foreign secretary tomorrow.

44:40.678 --> 44:44.515
At the lunch, to which the president
is wearing a charcoal suit.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.308
So you can't wear charcoal.

44:46.809 --> 44:48.435
- Any of these grab you?
- No.

44:48.936 --> 44:52.022
Ma'am, I don't love me
in this conversation either,

44:52.022 --> 44:54.066
but the stylist
is now a person of interest

44:54.066 --> 44:56.193
in the biggest security breach
we've had at Winfield.

44:56.193 --> 44:58.946
- We'll have to muscle through on our own.
- Alysse?

44:59.446 --> 45:01.198
After the Foreign Office.

45:01.907 --> 45:03.117
Car. Cars.

45:03.117 --> 45:05.452
You can't drop in
on the foreign secretary.

45:05.452 --> 45:08.831
You've spent more time with the guy
than your predecessors did in a year.

45:08.831 --> 45:10.374
It's been a big day.

45:10.374 --> 45:12.126
You've got to stop.

45:24.638 --> 45:27.433
Foreign secretary's office.
How may I help you?

45:31.103 --> 45:32.688
Tongues will start to wag.

45:32.688 --> 45:35.732
- Sorry to barge in. I know you're swamped.
- Not at all.

45:35.732 --> 45:38.777
I wanted to touch base
about President Rayburn's visit.

45:38.777 --> 45:40.487
A moving show of support.

45:40.487 --> 45:44.366
The atmosphere around the meeting
might be improved from our standpoint,

45:44.366 --> 45:47.911
with a clarification of
the prime minister's remark about Iran.

45:47.911 --> 45:51.123
As I understand it,
the prime minister was repeating

45:51.123 --> 45:53.500
what he'd heard from President Rayburn.
What was the phrase?

45:53.500 --> 45:56.670
- That was one head of state to another.
-"Light the place up."

45:56.670 --> 45:57.880
On a private call.

45:57.880 --> 46:00.632
This was dropped
into a sea of microphones.

46:00.632 --> 46:03.844
Sympathy for a grieving widow,
sadly misconstrued.

46:03.844 --> 46:05.179
We are way past sad.

46:05.179 --> 46:07.973
Four people were mowed down
in the street, two are children,

46:07.973 --> 46:10.350
- their mother is dead.
- As is their father.

46:12.394 --> 46:14.104
About half an hour ago.

46:15.898 --> 46:17.316
I'm sorry.

46:19.735 --> 46:23.864
Look, no one is more disturbed
about violence in our streets

46:23.864 --> 46:26.200
- than Prime Minister Trowbridge.
- Of course.

46:26.200 --> 46:29.161
But an unprovoked attack on our troops

46:29.161 --> 46:31.663
from a nation
with a history of aggressive--

46:31.663 --> 46:32.831
It's not Iran.

46:36.793 --> 46:37.711
It's not Iran.

46:39.213 --> 46:40.964
Well, then, our mistake.

46:42.883 --> 46:45.010
You're going to ask me how I know...

46:45.010 --> 46:48.263
You won't say, but fortunately,
I have your word.

46:54.895 --> 46:57.856
They kidnapped my husband
and called off a hit.

46:59.900 --> 47:03.529
They were going to assassinate
an American general and didn't.

47:04.196 --> 47:08.242
It was an offering,
like a dead squirrel on the doorstep.

47:08.242 --> 47:09.660
It wasn't Iran.

47:11.662 --> 47:14.915
The president of the United States
can't stand next to a prime minister

47:14.915 --> 47:19.169
who has just hocked up
an Islamophobic war whoop.

47:20.170 --> 47:21.755
He has to walk it back.

47:25.592 --> 47:28.345
Ambassador,
Number 10 will walk back nothing.

47:29.471 --> 47:30.389
Nothing.

47:32.224 --> 47:35.602
If you're concerned, I urge you
to speak with President Rayburn,

47:35.602 --> 47:38.730
who clearly has a great deal of influence
over the prime minister.

47:41.984 --> 47:43.443
Thank you for coming.

48:07.259 --> 48:09.469
Right after lunch. I have the time...

48:13.849 --> 48:17.060
Oh, to the dining room.
The mantel, not the table.

48:17.060 --> 48:20.564
I always gave Mrs. Vayle a copy
of the menu on the day of a formal meal.

48:20.564 --> 48:24.401
She liked to put them in her memory book.
Should I give one to Mr. Wyler?

48:24.901 --> 48:28.405
Mr. Wyler does not keep a memory book.

48:30.240 --> 48:31.908
You can salvage this.

48:31.908 --> 48:34.578
Buttonhole the president
as soon as he arrives

48:34.578 --> 48:37.289
and you talk him out of the lunch.

48:38.123 --> 48:41.918
At the very least out of the photo op
with him and Trowbridge side by side

48:41.918 --> 48:44.921
like some dark acid flashback
of the road to Iraq.

48:44.921 --> 48:46.506
You need to leave.

48:46.506 --> 48:49.426
- Eat something. You've been bottoming out.
- Leave this country.

48:49.426 --> 48:52.721
As soon as this lunch is over,
get on some plane going someplace

48:52.721 --> 48:54.931
- and not be here anymore.
- What?

48:54.931 --> 48:57.809
You made an inappropriate outreach
to a hostile power

48:57.809 --> 49:00.437
with whom we have no diplomatic relations.

49:00.437 --> 49:03.482
You made an investigation
exponentially more difficult.

49:04.149 --> 49:08.570
You have so thoroughly fucked
with my head, I-- I can't think straight

49:08.570 --> 49:12.616
or analyze information
or provide objective counsel.

49:13.283 --> 49:17.704
I can't do the fucking job
if you are within a 100-mile radius.

49:18.288 --> 49:20.791
I am begging you. Go.

49:23.877 --> 49:24.753
Katherine.

49:25.712 --> 49:26.880
Katie.

49:26.880 --> 49:29.424
Oh, come on. Let's talk about it later.

49:29.424 --> 49:31.802
I'm not discussing it ever again.

49:31.802 --> 49:34.680
The president will greet Hal first,
then you.

49:34.680 --> 49:38.058
Unless he does it the other way around.
Just basically go with whatever.

49:38.058 --> 49:39.226
Thank you.

49:39.226 --> 49:43.522
Katie, I can't leave. I'm so sorry.

49:43.522 --> 49:45.649
I don't want to hear this shit anymore!

49:45.649 --> 49:48.944
- You can't divorce me.
- Get a fucking grip!

49:48.944 --> 49:50.821
We decided that months ago.

49:51.363 --> 49:53.407
Katie, the vice president's gonna resign.

49:53.407 --> 49:56.076
They want you to replace her.
You can't be divorced.

50:10.841 --> 50:11.842
Close your mouth.

50:13.301 --> 50:14.469
Turn your head.
