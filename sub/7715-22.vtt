WEBVTT

00:04.070 --> 00:07.564
Well, I'm moving to Colorado
to start my new life
with Holly.

00:07.641 --> 00:10.509
Just up here getting
used to the altitude.

00:10.577 --> 00:11.738
Michael?
Yes?

00:11.812 --> 00:12.939
I've got
a treat for you.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.207
Oh!

00:14.281 --> 00:15.544
Thank you.
Like a butler.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.778
Colorado specialty,
Rocky Mountain oysters.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.320
Wow, those do not
taste like oysters.

00:22.389 --> 00:25.257
That's because
they're not oysters.
They're bull testicles!

00:25.325 --> 00:27.089
I cut them off
fresh this morning!

00:28.629 --> 00:30.621
Sick freak.
What is wrong with you?

00:30.697 --> 00:32.689
What is wrong with you?
I'm the sick freak?
Yeah.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.962
After what you did,
you expect to be buttled?

00:35.035 --> 00:36.765
After you didn't
recommend me?

00:36.904 --> 00:38.668
Dwight, I don't own
Dunder Mifflin, okay?

00:40.340 --> 00:42.366
The job was not
mine to give.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.014
Look, I need your
advice on something.

00:51.618 --> 00:55.146
I am told that there
are bears in the Rockies.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.349
Where did you hear that?

00:56.456 --> 00:58.925
Obvious, XM radio?

00:58.992 --> 01:00.392
Well, I was just thinking

01:00.460 --> 01:04.295
that maybe I should keep
a salami in my pocket...

01:04.364 --> 01:05.423
Great idea.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.659
...in order to feed
the bears.

01:06.733 --> 01:10.602
Especially if you think
that life would be
better without legs!

01:10.704 --> 01:12.104
How do you mean?

01:12.172 --> 01:14.801
Black bears can smell a salami
at five miles, Michael.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.036
What are you thinking?

01:16.109 --> 01:17.839
And they run
faster than a horse.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.641
So if you were thinking about
outrunning them on a horse,

01:19.713 --> 01:20.806
I would try a cheetah.

01:20.914 --> 01:25.909
You in tight pants, Michael,
are a salami to a black bear.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.579
Do you understand?
Mmm-hmm.

01:28.221 --> 01:30.713
 You're like
a giant walking salami.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.453
Okay,
so no salami in the pants.

01:32.526 --> 01:33.619
How about a pepperoni?

01:33.694 --> 01:36.755
Any kind of meat
you can possibly name.
Okay.

02:12.165 --> 02:14.259
You're not gonna take
all your toys, are you?

02:14.334 --> 02:15.563
Hmm?

02:15.969 --> 02:18.165
I mean, you don't...
You don't have
a job lined up, so...

02:18.538 --> 02:20.268
It's not like you have
a desk to put them on.

02:20.340 --> 02:21.774
Well, I have interviews.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.208
That's nice.

02:23.276 --> 02:24.972
What about that truck?

02:25.045 --> 02:27.241
Can I have
this little truck?

02:27.914 --> 02:30.509
Was thinking I might
glue a stapler on top

02:30.651 --> 02:33.246
or put a hole here
and stick pens in it.

02:35.255 --> 02:37.121
You okay?
Yes.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.022
Yes, you know what,

02:39.092 --> 02:41.254
take my favorite
truck, sure.

02:41.561 --> 02:43.120
You know what...

02:43.196 --> 02:45.427
It's your last
couple of days.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.297
I'm gonna get
out of your hair.

02:47.367 --> 02:48.630
Oh, you don't...

02:48.769 --> 02:50.067
I will be in
the break room.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.538
Okay, that sounds good.
Thank you.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.677
Dead man walking.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.680
Sad?

02:59.746 --> 03:00.805
No.

03:00.881 --> 03:01.974
No, no.

03:02.049 --> 03:05.747
I don't leave till tomorrow,
so tomorrow I will be a wreck.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.494
Stay away from Erin.
Hey.

03:15.562 --> 03:16.723
I'm your boss.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.629
Why don't you
stay away from me?

03:18.765 --> 03:20.597
No, I'm gonna stand
where I want, okay?

03:20.667 --> 03:22.033
You don't want to
get on my bad side.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.569
I've seen some
horrible things.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.162
I own over
200 horror movies.

03:25.305 --> 03:26.864
Okay, that's so weird!

03:26.940 --> 03:27.999
Just go away!

03:28.141 --> 03:29.234
No, you go away.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.784
Hi, Tuna.

03:41.254 --> 03:44.691
You guys are filming people
when they go to
the bathroom now?

03:44.791 --> 03:46.259
How about cupcakes?

03:46.359 --> 03:47.725
Please.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.524
What's wrong
with cupcakes?
Everything.

03:49.596 --> 03:50.791
There they are.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.265
The Party Planning Committee
together again.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.368
Well, we all wanted
to plan your goodbye party.

03:55.435 --> 03:57.427
We thought this
would be easier.

03:57.504 --> 03:58.733
We thought.

03:58.805 --> 04:00.137
It's an experiment.

04:00.207 --> 04:02.676
The three of us
have all been
chairmen before.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.371
So this is
the dream team.

04:04.444 --> 04:05.673
Hey!

04:05.779 --> 04:07.543
What are you saying?

04:07.614 --> 04:10.243
The dream team
and Meredith.

04:10.317 --> 04:13.583
We decided on the ice cream.
Mint chocolate chip.
Your favorite.

04:13.687 --> 04:14.677
Mmm.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.051
Yeah, that was a surprise.
MICHAEL: You know what?

04:17.124 --> 04:19.753
I'm thinking maybe
we should get ice cream
that everybody will like.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.817
How about vanilla?
Let's get vanilla.

04:22.629 --> 04:23.892
Okay.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.365
Tomorrow, I want everybody
to have a good time.

04:26.833 --> 04:27.960
No drama.

04:28.468 --> 04:31.336
And as for today,
just a typical day.

04:31.404 --> 04:32.770
All right?

04:33.473 --> 04:34.736
PAM: Should we
get toppings?

04:35.041 --> 04:36.134
What do you like, Pam?

04:36.376 --> 04:37.366
What?

04:37.444 --> 04:38.969
What kind of
topping would you like?

04:39.913 --> 04:40.937
Hot fudge?

04:41.681 --> 04:42.842
Sounds good.

04:43.216 --> 04:44.775
Fudge it up.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.856
I bought this for myself.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.585
And yesterday,

04:56.363 --> 04:57.854
they gave me this.

05:07.474 --> 05:10.535
I still need something
to drink out of, though.

05:20.887 --> 05:21.980
Attention, everyone.

05:22.055 --> 05:24.251
Before I leave tomorrow,
I would like to
reveal a secret

05:24.324 --> 05:26.816
that I have kept
for over 20 years.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.020
Secret about Phyllis.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.763
Please, Michael.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.663
When Phyllis was
in high school,

05:33.767 --> 05:36.362
she was so cute.

05:37.404 --> 05:39.202
And she still is.

05:40.373 --> 05:44.037
I thought he knew
about the baby I gave away.

05:44.110 --> 05:47.774
Look, Michael,
it's a going-away present
so your hands won't get cold.

05:47.848 --> 05:48.838
Ah.

05:49.015 --> 05:52.110
It's almost done,
but you can't get them wet,

05:52.185 --> 05:53.778
and they can't be
dry-cleaned either.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.790
You have to hand
wash without water,

05:56.857 --> 06:00.123
wring dry gently,
and use a hair dryer on cool.

06:02.495 --> 06:05.590
Sounds great.
I just think it's great.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.758
Oh, I have gifts as well.

06:08.835 --> 06:12.237
And I will start by giving
the first gift to Phyllis.

06:13.039 --> 06:16.168
Phyllis,
you are shy and sweet,

06:16.276 --> 06:18.973
and you don't
often speak your mind,

06:19.045 --> 06:21.446
but you should,
because you have
great ideas.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.015
So, Phyllis,
I am giving you this

06:23.083 --> 06:26.019
so you can always remember
to speak your mind.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.179
Gee, thanks, Michael.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.688
You're welcome.
It's cute.

06:28.822 --> 06:32.554
Stanley, you love your Sudoku
and your puzzles.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.894
I bestow upon you...

06:35.328 --> 06:36.887
My felt.

06:37.464 --> 06:40.992
May you never lose
the fun-loving
quality in life.

06:42.369 --> 06:44.964
Where's the rest of it?
It's got no balls.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.504
Well, okay.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.371
And Andy.

06:48.441 --> 06:52.401
Andy, who needs confidence
that he is a great salesman,

06:52.479 --> 06:54.141
I give you

06:54.447 --> 06:56.473
my clients.

06:56.816 --> 06:58.614
Our ten most
important accounts.

07:00.186 --> 07:02.155
Wow.
Yeah, wow.

07:02.355 --> 07:04.586
You know I'm the worst
salesman here, right?

07:04.658 --> 07:07.218
But you're the best
salesman on the inside.

07:07.294 --> 07:08.455
What does that even mean?

07:08.595 --> 07:10.564
You sold us all on Andy.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.792
A product that nobody wanted.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.298
I'm gonna lose them.

07:14.367 --> 07:15.357
You're not going to
lose them.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.596
I promise you
that I will.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.168
Just do your best.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.002
I have faith in you.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.711
Gimme those clients.
No.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.907
Do you believe that?

07:28.848 --> 07:31.044
I've given up
expecting Michael
to do the right thing

07:31.151 --> 07:33.985
or the decent thing or even
the comprehensible thing.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.217
DEANGELO: <i>I used to</i>
<i>be obese.</i>

07:36.289 --> 07:39.748
<i>Once you've conquered obesity,</i>
<i>everything else is easy.</i>

07:39.826 --> 07:43.024
<i>Life literally</i>
<i>moves in slow motion.</i>

07:43.096 --> 07:45.258
<i>I'm not saying</i>
<i>I'm Superman,</i>

07:45.632 --> 07:48.124
<i>but let me just</i>
<i>put it this way,</i>

07:48.201 --> 07:49.965
<i>if I were shot</i>
<i>in the head,</i>

07:50.036 --> 07:52.335
<i>I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>everything would be fine.</i>

07:52.539 --> 07:54.337
I almost welcome it.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.943
Kevin, I have
something for you.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.473
Oh!

08:03.316 --> 08:05.114
You know who that is?

08:06.353 --> 08:07.343
Oh.

08:11.624 --> 08:15.083
Don't be a caricature, Kevin.
Never be a caricature.

08:15.795 --> 08:17.730
How did that feel
when I tore that up?

08:18.465 --> 08:19.956
Better?
Good.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.224
Stand up.

08:24.904 --> 08:26.964
You will be thin.

08:27.707 --> 08:31.735
You won't drool over pizza
like an animal anymore.

08:32.445 --> 08:36.006
But, I...
You will find love.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.778
Michael, I'm pretty much
okay with who I am now.

08:39.852 --> 08:43.051
Don't be.
You should never
settle for who you are.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.460
Oscar, Oscar, Oscar.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.622
Oscar, you are a...

08:50.697 --> 08:53.997
Michael,
I just lost Porter Hardware!
I just... I lost them.

08:54.067 --> 08:57.731
Okay, you know what?
Just do your best, buddy.

08:59.406 --> 09:02.535
Okay, Oscar,
you are very smart,

09:03.109 --> 09:06.511
and you have
a gigantic education,

09:07.280 --> 09:11.240
and I think of
you as my Scarecrow,
because you gave me a brain.

09:11.951 --> 09:14.853
So that's why
I made you this.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.354
Thank you, Michael.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.255
It's beautiful.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.424
It looks like...

09:27.801 --> 09:32.262
It looks like it was made
by a two-year-old monkey
on a farm.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.935
And he just...

09:35.942 --> 09:39.174
He just accepted it,
that I...

09:40.180 --> 09:42.945
That I put all
this work into it.

09:43.983 --> 09:45.383
Oh, man.

09:46.186 --> 09:49.850
He has the lowest
opinion of me of anybody.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.282
Was it just me,

09:52.358 --> 09:54.850
or did you think
we were gonna have sex
at some point?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.191
It was just you.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.525
How would you
have wanted to do it?

09:57.630 --> 10:00.691
I don't...
Okay, you know what?
Inappropriate,

10:00.767 --> 10:02.463
because I am engaged happily,

10:02.535 --> 10:05.835
and you, you have
landed yourself a senator.

10:05.905 --> 10:06.998
State senator.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.267
Mmm-hmm. Bravo.

10:08.341 --> 10:09.707
Brava.
Brava.

10:09.843 --> 10:10.902
Do you want to
see some pictures?

10:11.044 --> 10:12.910
I just got these.
Sure.

10:13.880 --> 10:17.282
These are... Okay,
this is us at the theater.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.952
And, antiquing.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.120
Oh, rollerblading.
Rollerblading.

10:24.190 --> 10:25.385
Who's that?
Who's that guy?

10:25.458 --> 10:28.053
Oh, that's Thomas,
Robert's aide.
Hmm.

10:28.495 --> 10:30.828
I guess this
could be the one, huh?

10:30.897 --> 10:32.160
Yeah.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.700
Yeah.

10:41.908 --> 10:43.433
Hey.
Hey.

10:44.577 --> 10:48.844
I'm gonna be dropping in
on one of our biggest
clients this afternoon,

10:48.915 --> 10:50.008
and I could use
some backup.

10:50.884 --> 10:53.319
Let's rip it up, homes.
All right.

10:53.753 --> 10:55.221
Boom.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.761
Walk away, bitch.

11:02.428 --> 11:03.794
Oh, Michael.
Hmm?

11:03.863 --> 11:05.991
Where do you want
your last paycheck sent?

11:06.199 --> 11:07.724
Last paycheck?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.298
Do you have
an address yet
in Colorado?

11:13.106 --> 11:14.096
No.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.142
What town do
Holly's parents live in?

11:17.977 --> 11:19.445
I'm not sure.

11:20.713 --> 11:22.841
Mountainton, I think.

11:23.616 --> 11:25.244
Sounds beautiful.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.148
PAM: You should do
more stuff like that.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.450
KEVIN: I'm going to.

11:30.790 --> 11:33.316
Hey.
It's almost your last day.
Come on. Sit with us.

11:33.393 --> 11:34.622
No, I'm almost done.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.322
You sure?
Yeah.

11:38.431 --> 11:41.799
PAM: So I'm going to
Carbondale this afternoon
to get a new bulk shredder.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.337
KEVIN: Finally.
That old shredder sucked.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.464
It's a good shredder.
It just keeps breaking.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.701
Yeah, and it won't
shred magazines.

11:48.775 --> 11:50.437
It's not supposed to
shred magazines, Kevin.

11:50.610 --> 11:52.135
I know.

11:52.946 --> 11:54.710
Did you break
the shredder, Kevin?

11:54.781 --> 11:58.081
No. It's just that
old shredder sucks.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.916
Just get one
that'll shred magazines.

12:00.987 --> 12:03.752
PAM: I don't think
any of them are supposed
to shred magazines.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.056
I can't...

12:06.359 --> 12:08.123
I can't do this.

12:08.194 --> 12:11.028
All the channels are
gonna be different there.

12:11.097 --> 12:13.396
I'm not gonna be
able to find my shows.

12:13.466 --> 12:17.301
I'm not going to
start improv at level one.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.896
I don't think my credits
are gonna transfer.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.074
Oh! And you know what?

12:22.141 --> 12:25.578
I just figured out
where I was supposed to
go to vote.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.143
I gotta call her.

12:30.216 --> 12:33.345
And I'm going to tell
her that I cannot come.

12:34.454 --> 12:35.683
üPHONE RINGING
ON SPEAKERPHONEä

12:37.957 --> 12:38.947
HOLLY: <i>Hello there.</i>

12:39.092 --> 12:40.082
Hi.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.353
What is the name
of our town?

12:43.429 --> 12:44.829
<i>Boulder.</i>

12:44.897 --> 12:46.889
<i>Is something wrong?</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

12:47.367 --> 12:49.996
No. No, I just needed
to hear your voice.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.333
Yeah.

12:55.975 --> 12:58.137
Yes, my hero.

13:03.082 --> 13:07.019
<i>Okay, my mom's looking</i>
<i>at me like she has</i>
<i>no sense of humor.</i>

13:07.086 --> 13:08.486
<i>It's a joke.</i>

13:10.423 --> 13:11.823
Oh, I miss you.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.358
<i>Well, I'll see you</i>
<i>tonight.</i>

13:13.459 --> 13:15.485
<i>I'll pick you up</i>
<i>outside baggage claim.</i>

13:15.595 --> 13:17.359
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.663
I love you.
<i>I love you, too.</i>

13:25.705 --> 13:28.834
Yeah,
so I know I told everybody
that tomorrow is my last day,

13:28.908 --> 13:31.673
but I'm gonna be
leaving tonight.

13:32.912 --> 13:35.177
I head to the airport
at 4:00.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.487
And, I have said goodbye
to half of them.

13:48.061 --> 13:51.088
Well, you know, Michael,
I have a brother in Boulder.

13:51.597 --> 13:53.156
Rory Flenderson.

13:53.232 --> 13:55.133
You should look him up.

14:03.109 --> 14:04.372
Okay.

14:04.444 --> 14:05.537
Okay?

14:08.948 --> 14:10.280
Kelly?

14:13.686 --> 14:14.847
Kelly?

14:16.389 --> 14:18.221
Kelly?
What?

14:18.291 --> 14:20.726
If I just went away
right now,

14:21.227 --> 14:23.423
would that be the best gift
that I could give you?

14:23.496 --> 14:24.828
Yes, please.

14:24.897 --> 14:27.924
Please go away
and stop using that weird,
slow voice.

14:30.803 --> 14:34.365
She was once my girl,
and she is your girl now.

14:35.241 --> 14:36.766
Wow.
Yeah.

14:36.843 --> 14:39.312
This is
totally unnecessary.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.606
You're not prone
to seizures?

14:40.880 --> 14:42.041
No.

14:42.715 --> 14:46.083
So Michael said we can do
whatever we want cake-wise.

14:46.519 --> 14:47.987
What do we want?
Erotic.

14:48.654 --> 14:50.486
See? This is
what happens.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.354
You can't let
a street dog
into the house.

14:52.425 --> 14:53.654
Hmm. Let's hear her out.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.457
I would like to hear
more about these cakes.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.361
I know these Ethiopians
that run a cake shop.

14:58.431 --> 15:01.367
Good God.
They make these
cakes that are wild.

15:01.434 --> 15:04.802
I mean...
They show everything.

15:06.272 --> 15:07.968
No, I know
what you're thinking,
but it's not just black.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.269
They do it all.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.038
And the women
on these cakes,

15:11.110 --> 15:12.703
they're not just
guys' fantasies.

15:12.779 --> 15:15.112
They have real,
full women.

15:15.481 --> 15:16.642
It is refreshing.

15:16.716 --> 15:19.276
Okay, don't turn this
into some feminist issue.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.844
As a person who buys
a lot of erotic cakes,

15:21.921 --> 15:24.618
it just feels good to
be represented on one.

15:25.124 --> 15:27.923
You know what?
I think we should
get some other input.

15:28.494 --> 15:30.053
I think we should
do cupcakes.

15:30.129 --> 15:32.894
I am one of the few people
who looks hot
eating a cupcake.

15:32.965 --> 15:34.797
Yeah, cupcakes,
that's what I said.

15:34.867 --> 15:38.269
No. I am not
cleaning up a bunch of
uneaten cupcake bottoms.

15:38.337 --> 15:39.828
You know, we don't really
care about your opinion.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.431
You're just a tie-breaker.

15:43.042 --> 15:44.101
Um, Pam?

15:44.177 --> 15:45.440
Oh, hey, Michael.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.412
I'm just gonna
go to Carbondale
to price some shredders.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.006
I'll see you later.
Okay.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.860
ERIN: Gabe!
I need to talk to you.

16:10.937 --> 16:12.633
You can't be in here.
This is a ladies' bathroom.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.139
No, Erin,
I respect your privacy,

16:14.207 --> 16:15.607
but I will
follow you in here

16:15.675 --> 16:17.974
every time you go if
that's what it takes.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.410
Hey, Creed.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.970
Not cool, man.

16:22.381 --> 16:24.043
I really think
you should leave.

16:24.116 --> 16:26.381
Someday, you are going
to tell our grandchildren

16:26.452 --> 16:28.978
about how their grandfather
won you back in
a women's room.

16:29.055 --> 16:31.081
Gabe, can we talk
about this later?
I have to go. I have to go.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.285
Just read
the letter under your
windshield wiper, okay?

16:33.359 --> 16:34.418
It explains everything.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.723
Okay.
Okay?

16:35.795 --> 16:37.263
Do you want...
Gabe!

16:37.330 --> 16:38.423
Well.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.360
Here's the thing, Rory.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.528
I think you guys would
hit it off in an odd way.

16:43.803 --> 16:46.898
<i>I could bring him</i>
<i>a welcome basket.</i>
<i>I'll surprise him.</i>

16:46.973 --> 16:48.601
Okay, well,
you should give him

16:48.674 --> 16:50.302
a little time to
settle in, but...

16:50.443 --> 16:53.038
<i>Does he like jams?</i>
<i>My shelves are</i>
<i>overflowing with preserves.</i>

16:53.679 --> 16:56.478
Well, no, he hates jams.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.484
Darryl.
Hey.

16:58.551 --> 17:02.921
I would like to
give you the only copy
of <i>Somehow I Manage,</i>

17:02.989 --> 17:04.355
unfinished.

17:04.423 --> 17:07.018
If there's anybody here
who can finish it,
it's you.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.127
That's sweet, Mike.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.721
Let's see here.

17:13.132 --> 17:16.068
Here's a chapter
called "Gum."
Mmm.

17:16.135 --> 17:17.797
With one sentence.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.768
"Everybody likes the guy
who offers them
a stick of gum."

17:20.839 --> 17:22.273
Mmm-hmm. It's true.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.371
Darryl, I have
one last wish.

17:25.978 --> 17:27.640
I would like
to use the baler.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.444
No. Can't let you
do that, Mike.

17:30.516 --> 17:31.643
No problem.
Sorry.

17:31.717 --> 17:32.844
Worth a try.
All right.

17:32.919 --> 17:35.150
Darryl said I could use
the baler because I'm leaving.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.587
No.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.989
All right, guys, well,

17:43.462 --> 17:45.761
see ya later, warehouse.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.365
Catch you on
the flippety-flip.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.103
All right then,
see you, guys.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.744
Catch you later,
warehouse.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.007
See you on
the flippety-flip.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.877
Catch you on
the flippety-flip.

18:07.787 --> 18:10.655
Catch you guys
on the flippety-flip.

18:11.324 --> 18:12.383
Come on.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.121
 Okay.
So what's our approach?

18:15.194 --> 18:17.595
You a veteran?
Do I have a month to live?

18:17.663 --> 18:20.258
You gonna get
married tomorrow? What?

18:20.866 --> 18:22.095
Hmm?

18:22.168 --> 18:24.603
I thought we'd
just talk about
our customer service

18:24.670 --> 18:28.232
and exceptional
paper quality.

18:28.507 --> 18:30.032
That's stupid.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.471
Well, what do I know?

18:32.578 --> 18:34.444
I know.
What do you know?

18:34.513 --> 18:37.039
We gotta get psyched up.
Okay, guy?

18:37.350 --> 18:39.046
Let's get psyched.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.747
Is there an animal
shelter on the way?

18:43.255 --> 18:45.121
Yeah.
Awesome!

18:45.191 --> 18:46.716
Ani-ani-shelto.

18:49.061 --> 18:50.393
Andy, do you know
how to high-five?

18:50.529 --> 18:51.895
Yeah.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.125
'Cause if you do,
now's the time.

18:53.265 --> 18:54.460
All right.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.229
Not while I'm driving.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.438
Catch you guys...

19:01.841 --> 19:04.538
Catch you guys on
the flippety-flip.

19:05.911 --> 19:07.402
Flippety-flip.

19:10.716 --> 19:12.378
Flippety-flip.

19:14.720 --> 19:15.915
Really?

19:16.922 --> 19:19.653
Okay, see you guys.

19:25.464 --> 19:29.401
You know how I met Jo Bennett
and got started on
my ladder of success?

19:29.468 --> 19:30.663
No, I don't.

19:33.139 --> 19:36.166
Walking along,
out of work, again,

19:36.776 --> 19:38.176
thinking to myself,

19:38.244 --> 19:41.806
"I've only got
enough cash to buy
a sandwich or get drunk."

19:41.881 --> 19:45.977
And I see this guy
trying to steal
this lady's dog.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.681
So I grab the dog,
he runs off.

19:48.754 --> 19:51.087
She's so grateful,
she hires me.

19:52.091 --> 19:53.354
Aw, wow.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.358
Gimme that dog!

19:55.961 --> 19:57.088
It's not your dog!

19:57.663 --> 19:58.687
Yeah.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.993
Again.
Oh, okay.

20:02.334 --> 20:04.530
Gimme that damn dog,
you...thief!

20:05.771 --> 20:07.569
It's her dog!
Okay.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.733
Don't ever do it again!

20:11.310 --> 20:12.437
You feel that energy?

20:12.611 --> 20:13.772
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah?

20:14.146 --> 20:16.012
Whoo! Yeah.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.747
Okay, again.

20:21.387 --> 20:24.289
I know that Gabe is young
and hot and everything,

20:24.356 --> 20:26.791
and he's begging me
to reconsider,

20:26.992 --> 20:30.759
but I just think I'm in love
with someone else.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.193
Kevin?
Andy.

20:33.499 --> 20:34.489
Ah.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.058
I wish I knew who
my birth mother was

20:36.135 --> 20:37.967
so she could just
tell me who to choose.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.230
Maybe neither.

20:42.174 --> 20:43.608
I'm not attracted
to Kevin.

20:43.676 --> 20:44.837
Erin, listen to me.

20:44.910 --> 20:48.005
You shouldn't rush
into this at all.
And you know why?

20:48.080 --> 20:50.743
Because you are beautiful,
and you are fun,

20:50.816 --> 20:52.148
and you are smart.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.516
And when
the right guy comes along,
you'll know it.

20:57.823 --> 20:58.916
You will.

21:01.560 --> 21:02.789
Hey.

21:03.529 --> 21:04.861
And you know what?

21:04.930 --> 21:06.262
You don't need a mom,

21:06.332 --> 21:08.858
because you have my number
and you can call me anytime.

21:10.469 --> 21:11.630
Extension 147.

21:13.239 --> 21:15.105
Okay. Okay.

21:21.313 --> 21:24.715
Did you want
the 2726 or the 2730?

21:24.784 --> 21:27.219
Phyllis? Phyllis,
are my mittens done?

21:27.286 --> 21:29.255
No. No.
I'm on a sale...

21:29.321 --> 21:31.449
Okay, listen,
it's 2:00 p.m.

21:31.524 --> 21:34.084
From now until 4:00,
your priority is knitting.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.184
Knit like the wind.

21:35.327 --> 21:36.351
Okay, Michael.

21:36.428 --> 21:39.227
Dwight, I will
be leaving tomorrow.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.132
Yes?
So I wanted
to give you that.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.568
It's a letter of
recommendation.

21:51.777 --> 21:53.973
This is gonna be good.

21:55.247 --> 21:56.738
"To whom it may concern."

21:56.816 --> 21:58.614
Good, real personal.
Thanks, Michael.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.078
"The dictionary
defines 'superlative'

22:01.153 --> 22:04.021
"as 'of the highest kind,
quality, or order,

22:04.156 --> 22:07.024
"'surpassing all else
or others. Supreme.'"

22:07.092 --> 22:08.185
That's great.

22:08.260 --> 22:11.162
If I wanted
the dictionary definition,
I'd buy a dictionary.

22:11.230 --> 22:14.132
"I define it as
Dwight Schrute.

22:14.800 --> 22:20.205
"As a sales executive,
as a leader, as a man,
and as a friend,

22:21.073 --> 22:26.478
"he is of
the highest kind, quality,
and order. Supreme."

22:32.618 --> 22:35.486
Lots more like that.
Really repetitive.

22:39.425 --> 22:40.984
What's this?

22:42.761 --> 22:45.390
"2:45 behind the building,
paintball."

22:47.900 --> 22:48.924
Oh!

23:22.167 --> 23:24.193
Come on, come on!
Come on!

23:26.772 --> 23:27.762
Ow!

23:38.884 --> 23:42.844
I would like to
start by just saying
that I have not worked with

23:42.922 --> 23:45.790
Mr. Andy Bernard
here for very long.

23:45.858 --> 23:48.987
But I can say that
he is no Michael Scott.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.626
I can't sit here
and tell you that he's
gonna be a success.

23:53.098 --> 23:56.364
I can't sit here
and tell you that he's even
the best man for the job.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.496
But I can say this.

23:59.571 --> 24:00.800
He's got potential.

24:01.540 --> 24:02.803
Sure.

24:03.742 --> 24:05.973
You know, I always say,
"Go big or go home."

24:06.278 --> 24:07.906
You go with this guy,

24:07.980 --> 24:10.506
you could be making
the biggest mistake
of your life.

24:10.816 --> 24:13.980
Or the biggest good
decision of your life.

24:14.253 --> 24:15.881
It's either gonna be
the best thing you ever did,

24:16.522 --> 24:19.185
or the worst thing
you ever did.

24:20.059 --> 24:22.654
If you want some boring,
white bread clock-watcher,

24:22.761 --> 24:24.320
who's gonna
get you your paper

24:24.396 --> 24:27.389
when you ordered it
for the agreed-upon price,

24:27.800 --> 24:29.564
Andy's not your guy.

24:30.102 --> 24:32.071
You ever play
Russian roulette?

24:33.672 --> 24:36.107
Time to spin the chamber,
Boris...

24:36.976 --> 24:39.445
By signing up
for another year.

24:44.750 --> 24:45.774
What happened to you?

24:46.051 --> 24:47.144
You should see
the other guy.

24:53.692 --> 24:55.354
Jim, where is Pam?

24:55.961 --> 24:59.227
She's still pricing
the whatevers...
The shredders.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.164
But it is already 3:00.

25:06.905 --> 25:08.066
Right.

25:20.619 --> 25:24.181
Whether you're
scared of dying,
or dying alone,

25:24.256 --> 25:26.748
or dying drunk in a ditch,

25:26.825 --> 25:28.088
don't be.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.421
It's going to be okay.

25:29.661 --> 25:30.924
MICHAEL: <i>Yeah,</i>
<i>I was tripling up.</i>

25:30.996 --> 25:33.227
There's not enough
time in the day

25:33.365 --> 25:35.596
to have a special
moment with everybody.

25:38.303 --> 25:40.465
And you,
why are you still here?

25:40.873 --> 25:42.637
I'm either
gonna quit today

25:42.708 --> 25:44.870
or stay to make sure
that Andy's career
is destroyed.

25:44.943 --> 25:47.469
No, you are not
going to quit today.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.707
For goodness sake,

25:48.781 --> 25:51.012
this is not going to be
your last day at the office.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.845
 Everybody
gets dumped, Gabe.

25:54.753 --> 25:55.948
Can I give you
a piece of advice?

25:57.589 --> 26:01.048
A little cover-up
on your Adam's apple
will make it appear smaller,

26:01.126 --> 26:03.789
which will make you
look less like
a transvestite.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.841
That is cold, sir.

26:16.909 --> 26:17.933
Absolutely cold.
You know what?

26:18.010 --> 26:19.774
It was a complete
waste of my time.

26:24.316 --> 26:26.410
Uh, Deangelo, I'm...

26:26.618 --> 26:28.587
I forgot my bag,
so I'm gonna...

26:28.654 --> 26:31.146
I'll meet you in the car.
Okay, whatever.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.649
Sir.

26:34.159 --> 26:36.253
I'd just like to
apologize for that.

26:37.396 --> 26:39.365
I could tell you that he has
a steel plate in his head,

26:39.431 --> 26:41.161
or that he's crazy,

26:41.233 --> 26:44.761
but the truth is,
I think he's just
a terrible salesman.

26:44.903 --> 26:48.101
And I want you to know
that if you re-up with us,

26:48.640 --> 26:51.303
anything you need,
day or night,

26:51.410 --> 26:53.276
I will be the one
to take your call.

26:55.747 --> 26:57.010
Keep talking.

26:59.918 --> 27:00.977
Yes.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.313
Okay. All right.

27:03.655 --> 27:05.089
No. Well, thank you.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.490
Thank you.
All right. Take care.

27:08.293 --> 27:09.659
You'll never guess.
We did it.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.161
Hey!

27:14.199 --> 27:15.428
All right.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.059
All right.

27:19.404 --> 27:21.600
Good job, boss. Yeah.
We did it.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.778
Okay, everybody, come on.

27:29.848 --> 27:31.476
Conference room,
five seconds! Here we go!

27:31.650 --> 27:33.585
Hurry up! Let's do this!

27:36.421 --> 27:38.720
Yes. What is this about?

27:38.790 --> 27:41.419
What is this meeting about?
All right.
STANLEY: Mmm-hmm.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.123
Well...

27:44.396 --> 27:47.457
Okay. Here we are in
the conference room.

27:47.666 --> 27:48.929
Once again.

27:49.001 --> 27:53.564
And I just wanted to
call you all here together

27:54.773 --> 27:57.402
because I have
something important...

27:57.476 --> 27:58.967
Well, there's
two things, actually.

27:59.044 --> 28:02.242
Okay, first, I would like
a whereabouts on Pam,

28:02.581 --> 28:06.575
and, secondly, Phyllis,
how are those mittens coming?

28:06.652 --> 28:09.850
Because I would actually
like to bring them home
and pack them,

28:09.922 --> 28:11.515
and I am leaving
for the day at 4:00.

28:11.590 --> 28:12.683
They're almost done,

28:12.758 --> 28:15.284
but my knuckles are
swelling a little,
and I can't...

28:15.360 --> 28:17.352
Well, power through
the arthritis, Phyllis.
You can do it.

28:20.098 --> 28:21.464
Is that it?

28:22.334 --> 28:23.666
Um, hmm?

28:24.036 --> 28:25.402
STANLEY: Is that it?

28:31.944 --> 28:34.004
Um... Hmm.

28:35.747 --> 28:36.976
No.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.479
No.

28:40.018 --> 28:43.284
There's a special guest
that I would like to invite

28:43.388 --> 28:46.483
to say one last goodbye,
so here he comes.

28:46.558 --> 28:47.685
He's coming right in.

28:50.195 --> 28:51.322
It's Ping!

28:52.497 --> 28:56.161
And I'm here to say goodbye
to all you wonderful people.

28:56.268 --> 28:57.736
Thank you, everybody!

28:59.004 --> 29:01.030
You've been so wonderful.

29:01.206 --> 29:03.402
We were such a good...
Mmm-mmm.

29:03.542 --> 29:05.010
I "rove" you all.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.306
I "rove" you very much.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.241
Hey, can I talk to
you for a second?
Sure.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.871
See you later!

29:12.184 --> 29:13.243
So I've been
meaning to tell you.

29:13.385 --> 29:14.444
I want to take
you out for lunch.

29:14.519 --> 29:15.953
For your last day.

29:16.054 --> 29:17.113
Oh.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.191
What do you think?
Tomorrow? Lunch?
You and me?

29:19.324 --> 29:20.417
Okay.

29:22.861 --> 29:24.159
You're not leaving tomorrow.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.058
You're leaving today, right?

29:28.500 --> 29:29.832
Maybe.

29:30.702 --> 29:32.637
Wow, so that's it, huh?

29:32.838 --> 29:35.364
Just 4:00 and you
are gone for good.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.576
Why am I so sad?

29:37.943 --> 29:39.377
Am I doing
the wrong thing?

29:40.379 --> 29:41.904
Absolutely not.

29:42.848 --> 29:45.875
It's just that sometimes
goodbyes are a bitch.

29:50.355 --> 29:52.688
T-shirt idea.
"Goodbyes stink."

29:55.093 --> 29:57.619
Okay. All right. So...

30:00.732 --> 30:02.360
James Halpert...

30:06.471 --> 30:08.838
You started
with this company

30:11.343 --> 30:13.005
as a fine young man.

30:13.378 --> 30:15.540
You know what I
think we should do?

30:15.714 --> 30:18.274
I think we should just save
the goodbyes for tomorrow.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.648
At lunch.

30:19.918 --> 30:20.908
Oh.

30:22.020 --> 30:23.318
Okay.

30:23.955 --> 30:25.787
And then tomorrow

30:26.558 --> 30:28.049
I can tell you

30:29.594 --> 30:32.291
what a great boss
you turned out to be.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.428
Best boss I ever had.

30:40.706 --> 30:42.368
MICHAEL: Oh, shoot.

30:42.574 --> 30:43.735
That's my cab.

30:43.875 --> 30:45.241
All right.
All right.

30:46.078 --> 30:47.706
Listen, Michael,
I really...

30:47.779 --> 30:49.145
I did text Pam, but...

30:49.214 --> 30:51.046
I know. It's okay.

30:51.116 --> 30:53.415
Just give her a hug,
all right?

30:54.786 --> 30:56.755
I will see you
tomorrow at lunch.

30:56.888 --> 30:58.880
I am looking forward
to lunch.

30:59.257 --> 31:01.692
And hearing about
what a great boss I am.

31:03.128 --> 31:04.494
You got it.

31:06.965 --> 31:08.558
Okay.

31:10.602 --> 31:11.865
Okay.

31:23.548 --> 31:24.777
Phyllis.

31:24.850 --> 31:26.284
Oh, they're still not done.

31:26.418 --> 31:27.886
Oh, no, no, no.

31:27.953 --> 31:30.923
Let me see.
Oh, Phyllis.

31:31.523 --> 31:32.957
Nice try.

31:34.025 --> 31:35.459
I love them.

31:59.451 --> 32:00.976
See ya tomorrow, boss.

32:01.453 --> 32:02.512
Later, guys.

32:25.076 --> 32:27.102
MICHAEL: <i>Well,</i>
<i>got almost everybody, so...</i>

32:27.779 --> 32:29.475
<i>Holly's my family now.</i>

32:29.548 --> 32:31.141
<i>She's my family.</i>

32:31.450 --> 32:34.978
<i>And the babies</i>
<i>that I make with her</i>
<i>will be my children.</i>

32:35.687 --> 32:38.657
<i>The people that you</i>
<i>work with are just,</i>

32:38.990 --> 32:42.290
<i>when you get down to it,</i>
<i>your very best friends.</i>

32:44.196 --> 32:46.188
<i>They say on your deathbed</i>

32:46.264 --> 32:50.258
<i>you never wish</i>
<i>you spent more time</i>
<i>at the office,</i>

32:50.368 --> 32:51.563
<i>but I will.</i>

32:52.137 --> 32:54.800
<i>Got to be a lot better</i>
<i>than a deathbed.</i>

32:55.674 --> 32:58.974
<i>I actually don't</i>
<i>understand deathbeds.</i>

32:59.077 --> 33:01.205
<i>I mean, who would buy that?</i>

33:03.849 --> 33:06.842
Well, I guess this is it.

33:08.186 --> 33:11.350
Hey, will you guys
let me know
if this ever airs?

33:11.423 --> 33:12.789
Thank you.

33:13.725 --> 33:15.216
All right. Oh.

33:16.795 --> 33:19.822
This is gonna feel so good

33:19.898 --> 33:22.390
getting this thing
off my chest.

33:24.569 --> 33:25.764
That's what she said.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.709
PAM: <i>No, he wasn't sad.</i>

34:07.779 --> 34:09.007
<i>He was full of hope.</i>

34:09.981 --> 34:11.677
About Colorado.

34:11.750 --> 34:15.312
And he was hoping
to get an upgrade
as an awards member.

34:17.389 --> 34:21.326
And he said he was
just real excited
to get home and see Holly.

34:40.946 --> 34:42.608
Well, if he's not
gonna make it,

34:42.681 --> 34:45.617
at least we should go
ahead and eat the cake.

34:46.318 --> 34:47.581
Yeah.

34:48.719 --> 34:51.621
I, for one,
love the corners.

34:59.731 --> 35:01.632
Why did I just do that?

35:01.700 --> 35:03.828
This is not even that good.

35:03.902 --> 35:06.064
I don't even want it.

35:08.073 --> 35:09.871
I had cake for lunch.

35:13.111 --> 35:16.309
No, you know what?
I've been good.
I deserve this.

35:18.783 --> 35:21.582
What am I doing?
Come on, Deangelo.

35:21.720 --> 35:22.915
Hey...

35:27.826 --> 35:28.885
No!

35:30.495 --> 35:31.690
Uh-oh.

35:32.430 --> 35:33.625
DEANGELO: No!
