00:57.563 --> 00:59.398
<i>Look at the sonar.</i>

00:59.400 --> 01:01.333
<i>Let me know what you find.</i>

01:01.335 --> 01:03.468
<i>So far
nothing new, my friend.</i>

01:03.470 --> 01:05.272
<i>It just keeps getting worse.</i>

01:27.461 --> 01:30.861
D'Angelo, Marks,
talk to me.

01:30.863 --> 01:32.930
We've moved
to the sonar room.

01:32.932 --> 01:34.867
Just nine rescues so far.

01:35.835 --> 01:37.668
<i>It's a mess, man.</i>

01:37.670 --> 01:39.572
<i>This is the worst
I've ever seen.</i>

01:40.274 --> 01:41.275
Help!

01:42.976 --> 01:44.509
Help!

01:44.511 --> 01:46.844
Somebody help me!

01:46.846 --> 01:50.082
Help! Who's there?

01:53.619 --> 01:55.220
I got
one more survivor.

01:55.222 --> 01:56.787
Heading back
to the rescue vehicle now.

01:59.493 --> 02:00.958
Marks. D'Angelo.

02:00.960 --> 02:02.360
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

02:02.362 --> 02:03.928
I have no idea.

02:03.930 --> 02:06.797
Listen.

02:14.575 --> 02:18.577
<i>Jonas, we got
something outside the ship.</i>

02:18.579 --> 02:20.847
<i>There's something out there.</i>

02:28.388 --> 02:29.389
Here.

02:30.591 --> 02:31.689
You okay, pal?

02:36.463 --> 02:38.497
Oh, my God.

02:38.499 --> 02:39.930
<i>Something's crushing the hull.</i>

02:39.932 --> 02:42.467
Get back to
the rescue vehicle. Now.

02:42.469 --> 02:43.836
We're right behind you.

02:45.938 --> 02:47.671
You guys, move!

02:47.673 --> 02:49.113
Got him. Slide him up.

02:50.444 --> 02:52.511
Marks. D'Angelo. Report.

02:52.513 --> 02:53.911
You almost here?

02:53.913 --> 02:56.081
<i>Jonas, listen to me.
We're trapped!</i>

02:56.083 --> 02:57.015
What?

02:57.017 --> 02:58.617
The impact jammed the hatch!

02:58.619 --> 02:59.819
Coming back.

03:02.356 --> 03:03.654
<i>The sub
is starting to collapse.</i>

03:03.656 --> 03:04.955
Marks!

03:04.957 --> 03:05.956
<i>Jonas,
we need you down here</i>

03:05.958 --> 03:07.325
before it's too late.

03:08.996 --> 03:11.163
The sub's been breached.

03:11.165 --> 03:12.464
<i>There's water everywhere.</i>

03:12.466 --> 03:14.099
<i>Jonas,
the room is flooding.</i>

03:14.101 --> 03:16.901
<i>Marks, we gotta
get this hatch open.</i>

03:16.903 --> 03:18.470
<i>Come on, Jonas.
Where are you?</i>

03:18.472 --> 03:20.138
<i>- It's not gonna work!</i>
<i>- Let us out!</i>

03:20.140 --> 03:21.672
<i>Jonas, hurry, please!</i>

03:21.674 --> 03:23.542
<i>We just need
more time! Don't leave us!</i>

03:23.544 --> 03:25.544
<i>Jonas!</i>

03:25.546 --> 03:27.546
<i>Let us know
when you're here!</i>

03:27.548 --> 03:28.679
<i>Don't give up!</i>

03:28.681 --> 03:30.081
<i>Jonas, please!</i>

03:30.083 --> 03:31.316
<i>Come down here, now!
Where are you?</i>

03:31.318 --> 03:32.452
<i>Jonas!</i>

03:39.892 --> 03:41.061
You've lost your mind!

03:41.827 --> 03:43.028
Back off, Heller.

03:43.030 --> 03:45.397
If we go back, everyone dies.

03:45.399 --> 03:46.866
Everyone.

03:58.945 --> 04:00.380
What have you done?

05:33.607 --> 05:36.840
Are we living the dream here
or what?

05:36.842 --> 05:39.877
Welcome to <i>Mana One,</i>
Mr. Morris.

05:39.879 --> 05:41.446
Get that thing away from me.

05:41.448 --> 05:42.946
What are you doing?

05:42.948 --> 05:46.785
Come on, bring it in.
There we go.

05:46.787 --> 05:48.286
Good to see you again,
Mr. Morris.

05:48.288 --> 05:49.887
- Yeah.
- This way, please.

05:49.889 --> 05:52.390
Hey, you always smell so nice.
What is that? Sandalwood?

05:52.392 --> 05:54.958
It's impressive so far,
I'll say.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.328
Oh, here they are.

05:56.330 --> 05:58.029
Do you remember
my daughter Suyin?

05:58.031 --> 05:59.464
Our chief marine biologist.

05:59.466 --> 06:00.765
Hi.

06:11.911 --> 06:13.111
Sorry, what was that?

06:13.113 --> 06:15.015
- I didn't catch it.
- Uh...

06:16.283 --> 06:18.616
She says she likes your hat.

06:18.618 --> 06:20.352
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

06:20.354 --> 06:21.421
Yeah.

06:24.857 --> 06:27.459
- Let's go.
- Why don't we go? Yeah.

06:30.297 --> 06:32.099
Your granddaughter's
a pistol.

06:32.898 --> 06:34.101
Okay.

06:34.867 --> 06:36.570
What have we here?

06:38.472 --> 06:40.871
This is, um,

06:40.873 --> 06:43.241
really ugly.

06:43.243 --> 06:44.442
You know, I realize that

06:44.444 --> 06:45.643
we're under construction
and everything,

06:45.645 --> 06:47.078
but I really think that

06:47.080 --> 06:49.013
a world-class
research institute

06:49.015 --> 06:51.915
deserves
a world-class entrance.

06:51.917 --> 06:54.554
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

06:55.689 --> 06:57.255
<i>O-Level.</i>

06:59.793 --> 07:01.626
Whoa!

07:01.628 --> 07:03.828
Welcome to the O-Level.

07:03.830 --> 07:06.231
Nice.

07:06.233 --> 07:08.066
This is
our central hub,

07:08.068 --> 07:10.034
from which
researchers will access

07:10.036 --> 07:13.006
all five labs
once it's finished.

07:14.508 --> 07:15.509
Wow!

07:17.910 --> 07:19.613
Oh, look at that.

07:22.015 --> 07:24.084
That's not something
you see every day.

07:28.355 --> 07:31.389
Did you have
those whales here on cue?

07:31.391 --> 07:35.326
I might have lured them
with some whale songs.

07:35.328 --> 07:39.332
This is Lucy
and her daughter Gracie.

07:40.734 --> 07:42.066
Incredible.

07:44.604 --> 07:45.703
Wow!

07:45.705 --> 07:46.970
<i>Dive control level.</i>

07:46.972 --> 07:48.306
- Here we are.
- Please.

07:48.308 --> 07:51.011
Follow me quickly.
I hope we are on time.

07:51.545 --> 07:52.477
Come on in.

07:52.479 --> 07:54.614
Oh.

07:55.282 --> 07:56.347
Oh, man.

07:56.349 --> 07:58.016
I'd like you
to meet our engineer

07:58.018 --> 07:59.784
and sub designer, Jaxx.

07:59.786 --> 08:00.951
Hey, Doc.

08:00.953 --> 08:03.121
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:03.123 --> 08:05.723
Doctor Heller.
Our medical officer.

08:05.725 --> 08:07.125
Nice to meet you.

08:07.127 --> 08:08.493
You're like Bones, huh?

08:08.495 --> 08:11.696
DJ here pilots
our remote explorer.

08:11.698 --> 08:12.897
How's it going?

08:12.899 --> 08:14.332
You're my first billionaire.

08:15.435 --> 08:17.101
And of course, Mac,
our station chief.

08:17.103 --> 08:18.703
Mr. Morris, just in time.

08:18.705 --> 08:19.771
So I keep hearing.

08:19.773 --> 08:21.272
Try that.

08:21.274 --> 08:22.540
Just in time for what?

08:22.542 --> 08:24.476
<i>Good morning,
Mr. Morris.</i>

08:24.478 --> 08:26.878
Lori Taylor,
our mission pilot.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.213
<i>Hi, Mr. Morris.</i>

08:28.215 --> 08:29.214
Welcome on board.
It's good to have you.

08:29.216 --> 08:30.348
<i>Hey.</i>

08:30.350 --> 08:31.616
How's it going down there?

08:31.618 --> 08:33.650
Where'd you learn
how to pilot a sub?

08:33.653 --> 08:35.687
<i>I spent ten years
with a certain</i>

08:35.688 --> 08:37.489
whale-saving
environmental group

08:37.491 --> 08:39.624
that shall remain unnamed
for legal reasons.

08:39.626 --> 08:41.426
Yeah, ask her
if she ever blew up

08:41.428 --> 08:42.961
a whaling ship
with a homemade torpedo.

08:42.962 --> 08:44.028
Hey.

08:44.030 --> 08:45.163
No.

08:47.601 --> 08:49.200
That is a good hire.

08:49.202 --> 08:50.702
<i>Eleven in two.</i>

08:50.704 --> 08:54.472
<i>Water temperature
is at six degrees.</i>

08:54.474 --> 08:56.441
Mac, we are
through the thermocline.

08:56.443 --> 08:58.510
We are approaching
11,000 meters.

08:58.512 --> 09:01.181
One hundred meters
from the bottom.

09:01.882 --> 09:03.314
<i>Maybe.</i>

09:03.316 --> 09:05.216
<i>Maybe from the bottom.</i>

09:05.218 --> 09:08.052
"Maybe"? What does
he mean, "maybe"?

09:08.054 --> 09:10.088
Come on. Look at this.

09:10.090 --> 09:11.756
Since 1875,

09:11.758 --> 09:14.192
we've all believed
the Mariana Trench

09:14.194 --> 09:15.860
was the deepest place
on Earth.

09:15.862 --> 09:18.563
I've had a theory that
what we think is the bottom

09:18.565 --> 09:21.299
might actually be a layer
of hydrogen sulfide.

09:21.301 --> 09:22.967
Beneath that cloud,

09:22.969 --> 09:24.536
and a freezing
cold thermocline,

09:24.538 --> 09:26.838
there could be
a completely new world.

09:26.840 --> 09:28.373
Wow!

09:28.375 --> 09:30.074
The <i>Origin</i> is about to see
if my father is right.

09:30.076 --> 09:31.910
If there is warm water below,

09:31.912 --> 09:34.779
that means we're going to be
the first to see it.

09:34.781 --> 09:36.247
And what if you're wrong?

09:36.249 --> 09:39.918
Then you have wasted
$1.3 billion.

09:42.289 --> 09:43.490
You're kidding.

09:46.226 --> 09:47.725
He's kidding, right?

09:47.727 --> 09:48.994
Copy that.

09:48.996 --> 09:50.228
Wait. What?

09:50.230 --> 09:51.765
Ten meters.
Approaching boundary.

09:57.203 --> 09:59.103
Hovering at five meters.

09:59.105 --> 10:00.204
Full stop.

10:00.206 --> 10:01.506
Final checks.

10:01.508 --> 10:02.840
- Jaxx?
- Good to go.

10:02.842 --> 10:04.142
- Doc?
- Crew are go.

10:04.144 --> 10:06.377
- DJ?
- Sub and rover are a go.

10:06.379 --> 10:07.712
<i>Origin</i> crew,

10:07.714 --> 10:09.414
we are go for insertion.

10:09.416 --> 10:11.616
Insertion.

10:11.618 --> 10:13.451
Is everything sexual
with you guys?

10:13.453 --> 10:15.853
Sex, food, power and...

10:15.855 --> 10:17.188
Money.

10:17.190 --> 10:20.059
Blow it up now.

10:20.061 --> 10:21.292
<i>Dive control,</i>

10:21.294 --> 10:24.128
we are a go for... insertion.

10:37.577 --> 10:39.078
We're in.

10:39.080 --> 10:41.346
You guys, we're in.

10:41.348 --> 10:43.414
<i>It's a cloud.
It is not the bottom.</i>

10:43.416 --> 10:45.450
Lori, be careful.
We don't know the depth

10:45.452 --> 10:46.851
<i>on the other side of this.</i>

10:46.853 --> 10:48.353
<i>The sea floor could come
right up on you.</i>

10:48.355 --> 10:50.724
<i>Copy that, Mac.
We're ready.</i>

11:00.233 --> 11:01.833
You guys,
we are through!

11:01.835 --> 11:04.636
<i>I have multiple
small sonar contacts.</i>

11:04.638 --> 11:06.471
<i>There is life down here.</i>

11:06.473 --> 11:07.807
<i>Congratulations!</i>

11:09.242 --> 11:10.510
Deploying the lights.

11:29.763 --> 11:31.865
Lights deployed.
I'm gonna come around.

11:46.346 --> 11:48.713
Whoa!

11:48.715 --> 11:51.584
Oh, my goodness.

12:10.037 --> 12:11.538
- Wow!
- Whoa!

12:12.706 --> 12:13.871
Mac, tell me
you're getting this.

12:13.873 --> 12:15.640
We're getting
all of it, Lori.

12:15.642 --> 12:18.511
Got a lot of
smiling faces up here.

12:23.184 --> 12:25.685
DJ, we got positive terrain
to launch the rover.

12:26.252 --> 12:28.020
Copy.

12:28.022 --> 12:30.321
Launch is all yours.

12:30.323 --> 12:31.524
Okay.

12:32.759 --> 12:33.960
Rover is

12:35.996 --> 12:36.997
free.

12:38.631 --> 12:39.866
Copy.

12:44.270 --> 12:46.004
<i>Water temperature</i>

12:46.006 --> 12:47.674
<i>below three degrees Celsius.</i>

12:55.482 --> 12:57.851
How is this possible?

12:59.385 --> 13:01.953
This ecosystem
is completely cut off

13:01.955 --> 13:03.354
from the rest of the ocean

13:03.356 --> 13:05.356
by the freezing
cold thermocline.

13:05.358 --> 13:07.759
We should find
all sorts of species

13:07.761 --> 13:09.761
completely unknown to science.

13:09.763 --> 13:12.665
Sounds like a good investment.

13:16.569 --> 13:18.336
Lori, I have a contact.

13:18.338 --> 13:20.473
Bearing zero eight zero.

13:22.308 --> 13:24.143
Huh. It's big.

13:24.145 --> 13:25.943
Oh, it's huge.

13:25.945 --> 13:27.280
And it's moving fast.

13:29.883 --> 13:31.986
DJ,
is the rover seeing this?

13:33.853 --> 13:34.987
Negative.

13:34.989 --> 13:36.923
Let me try
and bring up some more lights.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.296
Rover One, <i>signal interrupted.</i>

13:45.298 --> 13:47.298
Whoa! I just lost telemetry.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.501
What the hell?

13:51.571 --> 13:52.970
<i>Origin,</i> recommend

13:52.972 --> 13:54.305
an immediate right turn
to three-five-zero.

13:54.307 --> 13:55.708
<i>This could be a landslide.</i>

14:04.784 --> 14:06.617
Last time I checked,
landslides don't make

14:06.619 --> 14:08.419
<i>90-degree turns.</i>

14:08.421 --> 14:10.423
It's right on us!
It's right on us!

14:14.761 --> 14:16.727
What the hell was that?

14:18.331 --> 14:19.831
Lori, what's going on
down there?

14:19.833 --> 14:20.731
You guys...

14:20.733 --> 14:22.669
- What?
- Come look at this.

14:24.938 --> 14:25.937
Whoa!

14:25.939 --> 14:28.006
What could do that
to the rover?

14:28.008 --> 14:30.209
I don't think
I wanna know.

14:31.845 --> 14:33.346
It's coming back.

14:36.549 --> 14:37.849
Oh, my God!

14:37.851 --> 14:39.517
<i>Let's get out of here.
Blow the tanks.</i>

14:39.519 --> 14:40.785
<i>I'm trying.
It's not working!</i>

14:40.787 --> 14:42.453
<i>- It's not starting!</i>
<i>- Mac, help!</i>

14:42.455 --> 14:43.989
- Whole system's down!
- Oh, my God.

14:43.991 --> 14:46.424
<i>Oh, my God. DJ, Mac.
There's something down here.</i>

14:46.426 --> 14:47.792
<i>Jonas was right.</i>

14:47.794 --> 14:49.596
<i>Jonas was right! Do you co...</i>

14:53.100 --> 14:54.832
Lori, come in.

14:54.834 --> 14:56.103
<i>Origin,</i> can you hear me?

14:57.071 --> 15:00.172
<i>Origin,</i> please respond.

15:00.174 --> 15:01.875
- Come on.
- Lori, come in.

15:05.179 --> 15:06.813
Wall, can you hear me?

15:09.283 --> 15:11.384
Toshi?

15:13.853 --> 15:17.189
Gather around, people.
Options.

15:17.191 --> 15:18.290
Not great.

15:18.292 --> 15:19.857
We know they're alive.

15:19.859 --> 15:22.327
I've still got telemetry
on their vitals.

15:22.329 --> 15:24.162
How long do they have?

15:24.164 --> 15:25.364
Maybe 18 hours.

15:25.366 --> 15:26.564
Ballast valves
are jammed,

15:26.566 --> 15:28.066
which means
it can't rise by itself.

15:28.068 --> 15:29.201
If we attempt to tow it,

15:29.203 --> 15:31.535
it's fifty-fifty
that the tanks will explode,

15:31.537 --> 15:32.970
and breach the capsule.

15:32.972 --> 15:35.040
- Can't we go hatch-to-hatch?
- Not a chance.

15:35.042 --> 15:37.642
The external camera's
showing severe hatch damage.

15:37.644 --> 15:39.144
We have to try something.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.711
They're six miles down

15:40.713 --> 15:42.880
and no one has ever attempted
a rescue at that depth.

15:42.882 --> 15:44.450
Well, that's not exactly true.

15:45.485 --> 15:47.618
No. No way.

15:47.620 --> 15:48.953
We can handle this.

15:48.955 --> 15:50.621
Not at 11,000 meters,
you can't.

15:50.623 --> 15:53.658
We've gone 5,000 meters.
8,000 meters.

15:53.660 --> 15:55.693
At some point,
it just becomes a number.

15:55.695 --> 15:57.262
Why don't you try this number?

15:57.264 --> 16:00.232
Three. That's how many people
have actually attempted

16:00.234 --> 16:02.134
a rescue below 10,000 meters.

16:02.136 --> 16:03.935
And the number one.

16:03.937 --> 16:05.603
That's how many are left alive
to talk about it.

16:05.605 --> 16:06.904
One man. Jonas Taylor.

16:06.906 --> 16:08.639
And look what happened
to that one man

16:08.641 --> 16:10.175
the last time he went
to these depths.

16:10.177 --> 16:11.575
He saved eleven people,

16:11.577 --> 16:12.777
including you, Heller.
That's what happened.

16:12.779 --> 16:14.313
He left our friends to die,

16:14.315 --> 16:16.614
because he had
pressure-induced psychosis.

16:16.616 --> 16:18.582
Come on, Heller.
That was your diagnosis.

16:18.584 --> 16:20.785
Jonas said
something attacked them.

16:20.787 --> 16:23.155
Something big enough to
take out a nuclear submarine.

16:23.157 --> 16:24.423
He's a drunk.

16:24.425 --> 16:25.890
You're not listening!
You're not listening!

16:25.892 --> 16:27.525
He washed up on a beach
in Thailand.

16:27.527 --> 16:28.994
- Did you hear what Lori said?
- I'm listening. I heard it.

16:28.996 --> 16:30.596
- Were you there?
- That's enough.

16:31.831 --> 16:35.067
We all heard
Lori's last transmission.

16:35.069 --> 16:36.467
We have to consider

16:36.469 --> 16:37.902
that <i>Origin</i> may have
encountered

16:37.904 --> 16:40.504
something similar to what
Jonas Taylor described.

16:40.506 --> 16:42.707
Something he was able
to escape from.

16:42.709 --> 16:44.909
<i>Ba!</i> Please.

16:45.912 --> 16:47.678
Prep the helicopter.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.916
We must go to Thailand.

17:25.917 --> 17:27.219
Your boat,

17:27.221 --> 17:29.054
she's killing me.

17:29.056 --> 17:31.256
Number one engine
slips out of the gear,

17:31.258 --> 17:32.757
and there's some leak
in the hydraulics.

17:32.759 --> 17:34.426
Hey, I'll take a look
at it tonight.

17:34.428 --> 17:35.659
That's what you said
last night

17:35.661 --> 17:36.894
and the night before that,

17:36.896 --> 17:38.763
and the night before that.

17:38.765 --> 17:39.930
Hey, I'm working up to it.

17:39.932 --> 17:41.699
You drink too much.

17:41.701 --> 17:43.035
Hey, now
you're only saying that

17:43.037 --> 17:46.038
because I literally have
a beer in my hand.

17:46.040 --> 17:48.739
You always have beer
in your hand.

17:48.741 --> 17:49.977
You know why?

17:50.877 --> 17:52.743
Because I drink too much?

18:15.536 --> 18:19.204
Now this is shaping up to be
an eventful Tuesday evening.

18:19.206 --> 18:21.506
You know
I like to make an entrance.

18:21.508 --> 18:22.873
Hell, Mac, after five years,

18:22.875 --> 18:24.675
just showing up
is making an entrance.

18:24.677 --> 18:26.844
What? You're living
above a bar? Really?

18:26.846 --> 18:28.926
Figured it was the only way
to get you to come visit.

18:32.685 --> 18:34.252
Jonas,
allow me to introduce...

18:34.254 --> 18:35.920
It's an honor to meet you,
Doctor Zhang.

18:35.922 --> 18:38.756
Always had a tremendous
respect for your work.

18:38.758 --> 18:40.192
You're too kind, Mr. Taylor.

18:40.194 --> 18:42.160
Yeah, no, I'm not.
You're a good man.

18:42.162 --> 18:44.695
Hey, can I offer
either of you two a beer?

18:44.697 --> 18:47.099
'Cause I'm gonna have a beer.

18:47.101 --> 18:49.034
It's not a social call, Jonas.

18:49.036 --> 18:52.170
You mean you didn't helicopter
in just to say "hi"?

18:52.172 --> 18:54.972
You wound me, Mac.

18:54.974 --> 18:57.775
- We have a serious...
- Problem?

18:57.777 --> 18:59.511
Thought so.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.379
Just like you know

19:01.381 --> 19:03.614
I don't dive anymore.

19:03.616 --> 19:04.849
Done being responsible
for people, Mac.

19:04.851 --> 19:06.151
Mr. Taylor...

19:06.153 --> 19:07.852
Hey, I mean no offense,
Doctor Zhang.

19:07.854 --> 19:09.920
I mean, if there was
two people on this planet

19:09.922 --> 19:11.722
that could get me
back into the water,

19:11.724 --> 19:13.757
it's probably you two.

19:13.759 --> 19:15.160
But you can't.

19:15.162 --> 19:18.363
You're gonna tell me your
problem, and I'll say no.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.232
You're gonna offer me money.

19:20.234 --> 19:21.366
I'll still say no.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.968
You're gonna appeal
to my better nature,

19:23.970 --> 19:25.604
and I'm gonna say no.

19:25.606 --> 19:27.606
Because I don't have one.

19:27.608 --> 19:30.674
So I say,
why don't we sit down?

19:30.676 --> 19:32.310
We'll enjoy a couple of beers,

19:32.312 --> 19:34.146
and then we can
get you on your way.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.748
Jonas.

19:37.750 --> 19:40.918
This happened this morning.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.188
<i>Let's get out
of here. Blow the tanks!</i>

19:43.190 --> 19:44.788
<i>I'm trying.
It's not working!</i>

19:44.790 --> 19:46.124
<i>It's not starting!
Whole system's down!</i>

19:46.126 --> 19:47.993
<i>Mac, help!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

19:47.995 --> 19:50.794
<i>DJ, Mac.
There's something down here.</i>

19:50.796 --> 19:51.997
<i>Jonas was right.</i>

19:51.999 --> 19:53.298
<i>Jonas was right!
Do you co...</i>

19:54.368 --> 19:55.900
It's Lori.

19:55.902 --> 19:58.336
Your ex-wife
and her crew are trapped

19:58.338 --> 20:00.771
below 11,000 meters.

20:00.773 --> 20:02.174
I fear they may
have encountered

20:02.176 --> 20:04.576
the same species
you did down there.

20:04.578 --> 20:08.313
I have divers with less
experience willing to go.

20:08.315 --> 20:10.282
But I feel
I owe it to my crew

20:10.284 --> 20:14.021
to give this rescue
the best chance of success.

20:16.089 --> 20:17.924
Please.

20:25.898 --> 20:27.934
Lori,
hand me that hexa key.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.137
Thanks.

20:34.575 --> 20:35.839
Oh.

20:35.841 --> 20:38.176
Okay.

20:38.178 --> 20:39.611
Okay, if we can
short out the firewall,

20:39.613 --> 20:41.747
I can... I can probably
reboot the computers.

20:44.585 --> 20:46.752
Okay. Try it now.

20:51.558 --> 20:53.759
Auxiliary power's back.

20:56.997 --> 20:59.097
Heaters are online.

20:59.099 --> 21:00.632
There's no way that we'll
get the engine started,

21:00.634 --> 21:03.435
but we might be able
to get the ballast tanks back.

21:04.904 --> 21:06.504
What are you doing?
Taking notes?

21:06.506 --> 21:08.342
Letter to my wife.

21:11.445 --> 21:12.912
Just in case.

21:13.714 --> 21:14.912
Hey.

21:14.914 --> 21:16.648
We got this.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.916
Step by step.

21:18.918 --> 21:21.921
Come on. Give me
that fighting octopus.

21:32.099 --> 21:33.632
See?

21:33.634 --> 21:35.168
Works every time.

21:41.708 --> 21:43.408
No.

21:43.410 --> 21:45.909
- What?
- We gotta can the lights.

22:06.133 --> 22:08.600
Turn out the lights.

22:08.602 --> 22:10.302
<i>There was
something down there with us.</i>

22:10.304 --> 22:11.503
<i>How can you be
sure if there were</i>

22:11.505 --> 22:13.605
<i>no observation windows
on your craft?</i>

22:13.607 --> 22:15.307
<i>'Cause whatever it was</i>

22:15.309 --> 22:18.610
<i>caved in the entire starboard
side of a nuclear submarine.</i>

22:18.612 --> 22:20.111
<i>That wasn't my imagination.</i>

22:20.113 --> 22:22.380
<i>Is that why
you blew the hatch mid-rescue?</i>

22:22.382 --> 22:25.949
<i>Hey, look, I brought 11 men
back safe and sound.</i>

22:25.951 --> 22:27.552
<i>You left
eight more to die</i>

22:27.554 --> 22:28.720
<i>because you panicked.</i>

22:28.722 --> 22:31.056
<i>If I hadn't blown the hatch,</i>

22:31.058 --> 22:33.224
<i>we all would have been
killed by that thing.</i>

22:33.226 --> 22:34.526
<i>There was no thing.</i>

22:34.528 --> 22:36.027
<i>There was no evidence
of anything.</i>

22:36.029 --> 22:37.295
<i>Because
it was destroyed</i>

22:37.297 --> 22:38.862
<i>in the explosion, Heller.</i>

22:38.864 --> 22:42.067
<i>Look, there was no time left!
So I made the call!</i>

22:42.069 --> 22:43.967
<i>And you left
our friends there to die</i>

22:43.969 --> 22:46.206
<i>in an act of cowardice!</i>

22:48.375 --> 22:50.908
What do you think
happened down there?

22:50.910 --> 22:52.444
He lost it.

22:52.446 --> 22:54.212
And now we're
about to send him

22:54.214 --> 22:56.348
into the exact same situation.

22:57.818 --> 22:59.150
Excuse me, Suyin.

22:59.152 --> 23:01.119
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but we need you.

23:01.121 --> 23:02.589
It's an emergency.

23:03.824 --> 23:05.856
What's wrong, Jaxx?

23:05.858 --> 23:07.225
Now they're leaking oxygen.

23:07.227 --> 23:09.096
They've got a couple of hours.
Maybe more.

23:10.997 --> 23:12.530
- I'm going.
- No.

23:12.532 --> 23:13.732
Wait, what?

23:13.734 --> 23:15.667
I'll take one of the gliders,
grab the <i>Origin,</i>

23:15.669 --> 23:17.335
- and tow her up.
- Wait!

23:17.337 --> 23:19.618
If the <i>Origin's</i> ballast tanks
blow, you're gonna die, too.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.109
We have to try.

23:24.944 --> 23:26.646
Mummy?

23:29.349 --> 23:31.082
Meiying.

23:35.355 --> 23:36.423
Um...

23:46.899 --> 23:48.268
Uh...

24:09.489 --> 24:11.124
Communications check!

24:14.694 --> 24:16.094
Good to go.

24:16.096 --> 24:19.564
Suyin, you are go for launch.

24:19.566 --> 24:21.006
Richard Byrd.

24:42.522 --> 24:45.292
<i>Auto descent
sequence initiated.</i>

24:47.894 --> 24:50.063
- Hey, Meiying.
- Hi.

25:19.392 --> 25:22.260
- Sir, we've got a new problem.
- It's your daughter.

25:22.262 --> 25:24.329
She took a glider
to try and save them.

25:24.331 --> 25:25.663
Why did you let her go?

25:25.665 --> 25:28.132
Trust me,
I didn't let her do anything.

25:28.134 --> 25:29.567
I was sort of
under the impression

25:29.569 --> 25:31.135
you're supposed to try
to save people

25:31.137 --> 25:32.003
who are dying
on the bottom of the ocean.

25:32.005 --> 25:33.271
Who's he?

25:33.273 --> 25:35.242
I'm the guy
who paid for all this.

25:36.443 --> 25:37.809
Uh-huh.

25:37.811 --> 25:40.178
You know, he looks heroic
and he walks fast,

25:40.180 --> 25:43.283
but he's kind of
got a negative attitude.

25:46.988 --> 25:48.253
What's the window?

25:48.255 --> 25:50.156
It'll be close.

25:52.025 --> 25:53.291
Who are you?

25:53.293 --> 25:54.526
I'm the one
that designed all this.

25:54.528 --> 25:56.394
So my life's in your hands?

25:56.396 --> 25:59.531
Pretty much. That a problem?

25:59.533 --> 26:00.465
Nah.

26:00.467 --> 26:01.666
You look like you might

26:01.668 --> 26:03.668
actually know
what you're doing.

26:03.670 --> 26:05.870
<i>Dive control level.</i>

26:05.872 --> 26:07.405
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:07.407 --> 26:10.808
Mac, have Doctor Heller
meet us in the medical bay.

26:10.810 --> 26:12.011
Heller?

26:12.013 --> 26:14.045
Did I not mention that?

26:14.047 --> 26:15.482
You mother...

26:20.420 --> 26:21.786
He's in perfect shape.

26:21.788 --> 26:23.723
Just like the last time
you examined me.

26:25.825 --> 26:28.426
Suyin took a glider
15 minutes ago.

26:28.428 --> 26:30.061
She's planning
on taking the <i>Origin</i> back up.

26:30.063 --> 26:31.362
Take me to the sub.

26:31.364 --> 26:33.431
- We're not done here.
- Yeah, we are.

26:33.433 --> 26:34.666
Lori's running out of air,

26:34.668 --> 26:36.167
and we're in
international waters,

26:36.169 --> 26:37.502
which means legally

26:37.504 --> 26:39.337
I can beat the ever-loving
shit out of you

26:39.339 --> 26:41.274
and get away with it.

26:42.709 --> 26:44.142
It's true.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.378
Legally, I mean.

26:46.646 --> 26:48.715
Good thing
he doesn't hold a grudge.

26:49.382 --> 26:50.782
Jonas, you do know

26:50.784 --> 26:52.584
that this sub is rated
for 12,000 meters, right?

26:52.586 --> 26:54.752
Like the one leaking
on the ocean floor?

26:54.754 --> 26:57.022
Ah. Good point.

26:57.024 --> 26:58.556
- We good?
- Yep.

26:58.558 --> 27:00.025
Once you strip back
the safeties

27:00.027 --> 27:02.594
and go full manual,
like I know you're gonna do,

27:02.596 --> 27:03.996
the system's gonna
have problems

27:03.998 --> 27:06.497
trying to keep up
with your pressure changes.

27:06.499 --> 27:08.199
Try not to blow
your ears out, brother.

27:08.201 --> 27:10.270
Thanks, mate.

27:23.850 --> 27:26.184
Hello, skipper.

27:26.186 --> 27:28.121
You must be the crazy guy.

27:28.922 --> 27:30.755
Now who called me that?

27:30.757 --> 27:32.559
My mom. Doctor Heller.

27:33.560 --> 27:36.227
Yeah, well, I'm not crazy.

27:36.229 --> 27:38.463
I've just seen things
no one else has.

27:38.465 --> 27:41.100
That's the definition
of crazy.

27:43.903 --> 27:47.140
Backup power. Backup power...

27:52.013 --> 27:53.645
So where are your parents?

27:53.647 --> 27:56.381
My mom's trying
to bring our friends back

27:56.383 --> 27:58.683
from the bottom of the ocean.

27:58.685 --> 28:02.687
My dad's with a Pilates
instructor in Taipei.

28:02.689 --> 28:05.456
Granddad says
Mom needs to move on,

28:05.458 --> 28:07.358
but Mom says
she needs some more time

28:07.360 --> 28:09.427
because she was
married to an a-hole.

28:09.429 --> 28:11.431
Sounds like
your mom's got a point.

28:15.869 --> 28:17.635
You know a lot.

28:17.637 --> 28:20.173
Eight-year-olds
hear everything.

28:21.908 --> 28:23.877
Mind if I give it a try?

28:26.279 --> 28:28.248
Bye.

28:33.253 --> 28:34.487
Hey, Crazy.

28:35.855 --> 28:38.790
Is my mom gonna die?

28:38.792 --> 28:42.094
I'll have <i>Captain Bubbles</i>
and your mom back in no time.

28:42.096 --> 28:44.197
I promise.

28:49.202 --> 28:50.802
Thank you, Emma.

28:50.804 --> 28:52.503
Evolution
<i>launch in T-minus 15 seconds.</i>

28:52.505 --> 28:54.073
- DJ?
- Yeah.

28:54.075 --> 28:56.274
Jaxx, we good?

28:56.276 --> 28:57.709
Doc?

28:57.711 --> 28:59.877
<i>Evolution,</i>

28:59.879 --> 29:01.247
we are go for dive.

29:04.417 --> 29:05.785
Fancy.

29:13.493 --> 29:16.863
<i>System go for descent.</i>

29:18.565 --> 29:21.733
<i>System go for descent.</i>

29:21.735 --> 29:24.169
Hey, brother.
We're good to go.

29:24.171 --> 29:25.572
<i>System go for descent.</i>

29:29.076 --> 29:31.943
<i>System go for descent.</i>

29:34.781 --> 29:35.780
Jonas.

29:35.782 --> 29:37.484
<i>System go for descent.</i>

29:45.226 --> 29:48.693
Evolution <i>successful launch.</i>

29:55.769 --> 29:59.006
Evolution <i>now passing</i>
<i>1,000 meters.</i>

30:02.842 --> 30:06.511
<i>Caution.</i> Evolution
<i>secondary systems offline.</i>

30:06.513 --> 30:09.047
How is he descending so fast?

30:09.049 --> 30:11.516
Looks like he's diverted
all nonessential power

30:11.518 --> 30:13.518
like heat and life support
to the motors.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.919
He's gonna black out.

30:18.092 --> 30:20.060
His blood gases are dropping.

30:22.129 --> 30:23.461
Jonas.

30:23.463 --> 30:24.964
<i>Tell Heller
I'm not slowing down.</i>

30:35.341 --> 30:36.474
<i>Suyin, be advised.</i>

30:36.476 --> 30:37.809
Evolution <i>is now en route.</i>

30:37.811 --> 30:39.443
Request you return
to <i>Mana One</i> immediately.

30:39.445 --> 30:40.678
<i>Negative.</i>

30:40.680 --> 30:42.547
He can give us
an escort on our way up.

30:42.549 --> 30:44.515
Tell her to get
out of the way, Mac.

30:44.517 --> 30:45.950
More people means more risk

30:45.952 --> 30:47.385
<i>and she's in
way over her head.</i>

30:47.387 --> 30:49.823
Jonas, you just
told her yourself.

30:51.324 --> 30:52.623
What?

30:52.625 --> 30:54.059
The little green button
on your intercom,

30:54.061 --> 30:56.030
that's for single channel
communication.

30:56.963 --> 30:58.731
Brilliant.

31:07.074 --> 31:08.942
<i>Entering thermocline.</i>

31:19.886 --> 31:21.220
<i>Okay, Mac.</i>

31:21.222 --> 31:22.956
<i>I am through.</i>

31:24.657 --> 31:25.957
<i>Warning.</i>

31:25.959 --> 31:28.994
<i>Pressure load
approaching 16,000 psi.</i>

31:28.996 --> 31:30.229
<i>At this speed,</i>

31:30.231 --> 31:31.796
<i>I'm gonna have to divert
power from the heaters</i>

31:31.798 --> 31:33.478
<i>and shut down anything
that could ice over.</i>

31:34.534 --> 31:35.835
<i>Call you from the other side.</i>

31:39.439 --> 31:42.341
You got Wi-Fi here?

31:42.343 --> 31:43.776
All right.

31:44.577 --> 31:45.910
Okay.

31:45.912 --> 31:47.778
Just... Just keep
pressure on that.

31:47.780 --> 31:49.447
Toshi, is it still out there?

31:49.449 --> 31:50.882
I can't tell.

31:50.884 --> 31:52.752
I can't see anything
right now.

32:27.187 --> 32:28.552
Oh.

32:28.554 --> 32:30.821
There it is.

32:30.823 --> 32:32.291
I've got visual
on the <i>Origin.</i>

32:32.293 --> 32:33.457
<i>I can see most of it.</i>

32:33.459 --> 32:35.294
Okay. They're alive.

32:35.296 --> 32:36.863
I'm going to set up to tow.

32:40.100 --> 32:43.368
<i>Range to target. Six meters.</i>

32:43.370 --> 32:44.502
<i>Four meters.</i>

32:44.504 --> 32:46.639
<i>Target locked.</i>

32:49.609 --> 32:51.676
Firing magnetic hook.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.477
Three. Two.

33:07.894 --> 33:10.062
Suyin? Are you okay?
What's happening?

33:10.064 --> 33:12.863
<i>There is something
down here.</i>

33:12.865 --> 33:15.635
<i>Something just hit my ship.</i>

33:29.882 --> 33:31.682
<i>Suyin, what's happening?</i>

33:31.684 --> 33:33.151
It's a huge squid.

33:33.153 --> 33:34.585
It's got the glider.

33:34.587 --> 33:36.154
<i>Warning.
Capsule pressure.</i>

33:36.156 --> 33:39.157
<i>Mac, it's crushing me.
It's crushing me!</i>

33:39.159 --> 33:40.825
<i>I don't think
the glider can take it.</i>

33:40.827 --> 33:42.427
It's not gonna hold.

33:44.731 --> 33:47.698
<i>Suyin, engage
the pressure compensator.</i>

33:47.700 --> 33:50.135
<i>Compensator
will not engage.</i>

33:50.137 --> 33:52.006
<i>Capsule breach in ten seconds.</i>

33:55.275 --> 33:57.075
<i>Capsule breach in five sec...</i>

34:16.096 --> 34:18.232
My God!

34:21.034 --> 34:22.434
It's a shark.

34:22.436 --> 34:24.635
<i>It's like 20, 25 meters.</i>

34:24.637 --> 34:26.138
It's a megalodon.

34:26.139 --> 34:27.806
<i>Impossible.</i>

34:29.976 --> 34:32.578
<i>I'm so glad I'm not crazy.</i>

34:37.550 --> 34:39.217
Suyin, power down.

34:39.219 --> 34:40.650
It's drawn to the light.

34:40.652 --> 34:42.920
Shut everything down
and stay dark.

34:42.922 --> 34:44.722
<i>Shutdown in 30 seconds.</i>

34:44.724 --> 34:46.123
<i>Shutting off
everything but comms.</i>

34:46.126 --> 34:47.591
<i>It's circling back.</i>

34:47.592 --> 34:48.958
<i>Here it comes, Suyin.</i>

34:48.960 --> 34:50.795
<i>Shutdown in 25 seconds.</i>

34:50.797 --> 34:52.431
<i>Suyin, there's no time.</i>

34:52.433 --> 34:53.731
Turn off your lights.

34:53.733 --> 34:55.833
<i>Shutdown in 20 seconds.</i>

34:55.835 --> 34:58.036
<i>Turn them off. Now.</i>

34:58.038 --> 34:59.770
<i>Shutdown in 15 seconds.</i>

34:59.772 --> 35:01.141
<i>Mac, I have no control.</i>

35:03.077 --> 35:04.142
<i>Hurry.</i>

35:04.144 --> 35:06.178
<i>Ten, nine,</i>

35:06.180 --> 35:07.711
<i>eight, seven,</i>

35:07.713 --> 35:10.050
<i>six, five...</i>

35:29.936 --> 35:31.602
Now's your chance.
Blow your tanks.

35:31.604 --> 35:34.172
No. I can help you
save the crew.

35:34.174 --> 35:36.874
<i>Your glider's damaged.
There's nothing you can do.</i>

35:36.876 --> 35:38.878
Blow your tanks now.

35:39.712 --> 35:41.048
Damn it.

35:48.322 --> 35:49.687
<i>Doctor Zhang,</i>

35:49.689 --> 35:51.389
<i>your daughter's clear.</i>

35:51.391 --> 35:54.294
<i>I'm heading</i>
<i>for the</i> Origin <i>now.</i>

36:00.234 --> 36:02.735
<i>Range to target: three meters.</i>

36:12.146 --> 36:14.114
<i>Water extraction complete.</i>

36:23.090 --> 36:25.425
Let's do this, sweetheart.

36:46.980 --> 36:49.916
Tell me this isn't the world's
best "I told you so."

36:50.651 --> 36:51.882
You came all the way here

36:51.884 --> 36:53.218
just to tell me that,
didn't you?

36:53.220 --> 36:55.187
Pretty much.

36:55.189 --> 36:57.457
Give me your hand.

37:01.995 --> 37:04.563
Ah, that doesn't look good.
Ready? One, two, three.

37:07.534 --> 37:09.401
She's coming.

37:09.403 --> 37:11.735
Let's move.

37:11.737 --> 37:14.406
If that thing hits us
while we're still attached...

37:14.408 --> 37:16.276
Then we're all gonna die.

37:23.617 --> 37:24.884
Come on, I've got you.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.519
It's gonna be close.

37:27.521 --> 37:29.256
Come on, move, move!

37:31.458 --> 37:33.124
Go! Go! Go!

37:33.126 --> 37:35.427
We're not
gonna make it.

37:35.429 --> 37:37.364
- Come on.
- Toshi, hurry!

37:38.498 --> 37:39.765
Toshi, no!

38:09.962 --> 38:11.265
<i>Come in,</i> Evolution.

38:12.633 --> 38:14.534
<i>Jonas, come in.</i>

38:15.935 --> 38:18.205
<i>Are you all okay?</i>

38:21.108 --> 38:23.475
<i>Doctor Heller has vitals
on Lori and The Wall,</i>

38:23.477 --> 38:25.512
<i>but we don't have Toshi.</i>

38:26.313 --> 38:27.481
<i>Is Toshi okay?</i>

38:28.948 --> 38:31.318
<i>Jonas, is Toshi okay?</i>

38:32.653 --> 38:34.019
- All right.
- Nice and easy.

38:34.021 --> 38:35.487
Yeah. Yep.

38:35.489 --> 38:37.022
- Don't move her neck.
- Careful.

38:37.024 --> 38:39.993
That's good.
Grab a hold. We got her.

38:51.405 --> 38:53.837
You couldn't bring
Toshi back?

38:53.839 --> 38:56.576
- Why not?
- He closed the hatch.

38:58.412 --> 38:59.912
He saved us.

39:00.946 --> 39:02.549
You left him.

39:04.917 --> 39:07.385
You left him
because that's who you are.

39:07.387 --> 39:09.820
You are the guy
who leaves people behind.

39:09.822 --> 39:11.489
You go that deep,

39:11.491 --> 39:13.358
you take your life
in your hands.

39:13.360 --> 39:16.263
It was your choice
to send them down.

39:20.667 --> 39:23.503
This is why
I don't do this anymore, Mac.

39:35.749 --> 39:36.949
How is she?

39:39.586 --> 39:41.852
Well, the puncture
just missed her liver.

39:41.854 --> 39:43.488
She lost a lot of blood.

39:43.490 --> 39:45.025
But she's stable.

39:52.799 --> 39:54.000
Jonas.

39:56.969 --> 39:58.405
I'm sorry.

39:59.506 --> 40:01.108
I was wrong.

40:03.710 --> 40:05.245
You save Lori,

40:06.213 --> 40:08.014
we can call it even.

40:35.242 --> 40:37.575
I just want to apologize
for before.

40:37.577 --> 40:39.978
I was angry
and I lose my temper.

40:39.980 --> 40:41.448
And you did save my...

40:43.550 --> 40:44.551
You're naked.

40:49.156 --> 40:54.060
I know you did all you could.
So, thank you.

40:54.694 --> 40:56.161
Yeah.

40:56.163 --> 40:58.396
You're welcome.

40:58.398 --> 41:02.102
I know it's not easy
being the person who survives.

41:03.969 --> 41:05.837
I'm gonna go now.

41:05.839 --> 41:06.970
You should
put on some clothes.

41:06.972 --> 41:09.274
Yep. That's the original plan.

41:09.276 --> 41:11.411
Okay, then. Carry on.

41:31.264 --> 41:34.065
Hi. Uh... I was...

41:34.067 --> 41:35.469
It's all good.

41:37.137 --> 41:39.771
Jonas and Lori were the worst
married couple ever, you know?

41:39.773 --> 41:40.971
Uh-huh.

41:40.973 --> 41:43.243
Whole experiment
was over in a year.

41:44.644 --> 41:46.513
I didn't ask anything.

41:47.481 --> 41:49.149
I know.

41:54.588 --> 41:58.022
This is what
attacked us. A megalodon.

41:58.024 --> 42:00.191
How big is that thing?

42:00.193 --> 42:04.329
Between 70 and 90 feet.
21 to 27 meters.

42:04.331 --> 42:08.233
The megalodon was the largest
shark that ever existed.

42:08.235 --> 42:10.134
It feared nothing.

42:10.136 --> 42:12.770
It had no predators.

42:12.772 --> 42:16.274
Its jaws were stronger
than any other animal, ever.

42:16.276 --> 42:19.143
The meg could bite
a whale in half,

42:19.145 --> 42:20.912
crushing through the bones.

42:20.914 --> 42:22.947
We are
in uncharted territory.

42:22.949 --> 42:24.349
Until today

42:24.351 --> 42:26.751
megalodons were thought
to have been extinct

42:26.753 --> 42:28.319
for over two million years.

42:28.321 --> 42:30.655
- Wrong.
- A living fossil.

42:30.657 --> 42:33.627
That living fossil
ate my friend.

42:35.328 --> 42:37.195
I cannot begin
to express

42:37.197 --> 42:39.063
my sadness for Toshi's death.

42:39.065 --> 42:41.132
We have the discovery
of a lifetime.

42:41.134 --> 42:43.603
This is what Toshi worked for.

42:45.472 --> 42:47.272
It's what
we've all worked for.

42:47.274 --> 42:50.775
But we're going
to have to proceed slowly.

42:50.777 --> 42:53.580
Yeah, that's really
not gonna work for me.

42:56.182 --> 42:58.351
What is <i>Mana One?</i>

42:59.085 --> 43:00.385
This station?

43:00.387 --> 43:02.355
Yes. And what's it doing?

43:03.223 --> 43:05.292
Hmm? Right now.

43:07.661 --> 43:08.960
Exactly.

43:08.962 --> 43:10.962
Nothing.

43:10.964 --> 43:12.564
20 million dollar rover, gone.

43:12.566 --> 43:15.433
Thirty million dollar sub,
gone.

43:15.435 --> 43:17.435
You are now sitting
in the most expensive

43:17.437 --> 43:20.171
underwater marine
biology day camp

43:20.173 --> 43:21.974
in human history.

43:21.976 --> 43:24.242
Hey, Crazy.

43:24.244 --> 43:25.677
And now that
we've actually

43:25.679 --> 43:27.280
found something amazing,

43:28.049 --> 43:30.281
we can't proceed slowly.

43:30.283 --> 43:33.451
Thank you
for keeping your promise.

43:33.453 --> 43:35.054
- You're welcome.
- You don't quit

43:35.056 --> 43:37.322
trying to get to the Moon
because you lose an astronaut.

43:37.324 --> 43:38.756
You charge forward,

43:38.758 --> 43:41.826
or someone else
will get there first.

43:41.828 --> 43:45.129
Other people will want
a piece of this thing,

43:45.131 --> 43:47.532
whether we like it or not.

43:47.534 --> 43:49.202
You seem to like it.

43:50.604 --> 43:54.639
- Excuse me?
- I said, you seem to like it.

43:54.641 --> 43:57.208
I'm sorry.
Is he part of this team?

43:57.210 --> 43:59.611
You're damn right
he's a part of this team.

43:59.613 --> 44:01.479
Okay.

44:01.481 --> 44:02.947
You ever think
that Mother Nature

44:02.949 --> 44:05.516
might know what she's doing?

44:05.518 --> 44:10.421
The thermocline might
just be there for a reason?

44:10.423 --> 44:15.193
Hey, look, you wanna explore?
Go ahead, explore.

44:15.195 --> 44:18.296
But if you start sending
people back down there,

44:18.298 --> 44:20.832
don't call me
to come save your asses.

44:20.834 --> 44:22.433
Because in case what happened
down there

44:22.435 --> 44:24.402
wasn't clear to you,

44:24.404 --> 44:27.338
man vs. meg isn't a fight.

44:27.340 --> 44:28.642
It's a slaughter.

44:43.289 --> 44:45.456
<i>O-Level.</i>

45:24.999 --> 45:27.832
What you people discovered
is an even bigger goldmine

45:27.834 --> 45:30.102
than we ever thought
possible.

45:30.104 --> 45:31.869
We are completely unprepared

45:31.871 --> 45:33.571
to deal with creatures
like megalodon.

45:33.573 --> 45:35.239
I understand,
and we can get prepared.

45:35.241 --> 45:37.142
I'm talking about
a long-term plan.

46:30.930 --> 46:32.730
That's gonna be
the other alternative.

46:35.268 --> 46:36.569
What's that?

46:40.907 --> 46:42.009
My daughter.

46:51.484 --> 46:52.917
Jonas.

46:52.919 --> 46:54.186
- Did you see Meiying?
- We can't find Meiying.

46:54.188 --> 46:56.921
Meiying? Meiying?

46:56.923 --> 46:58.603
- I'll take this way.
- Let's try this way.

47:05.166 --> 47:06.366
Meiying.

47:06.933 --> 47:07.934
Meiying?

47:09.636 --> 47:11.504
- Meiying.
- Mama.

47:13.973 --> 47:15.974
Are you okay?

47:15.976 --> 47:20.112
There's a monster
and it's watching us.

47:39.766 --> 47:41.634
It's okay.
It's just a whale.

47:42.802 --> 47:44.537
Wait. Where's Lucy?

47:46.040 --> 47:48.173
Where's the mom?

48:00.854 --> 48:03.788
Is the station all right?
Report.

48:03.790 --> 48:05.489
No leaks. No visible damage.

48:05.491 --> 48:08.392
All right, team.
Initiate emergency protocols.

48:08.394 --> 48:09.861
And nobody is to go
near the water.

48:09.863 --> 48:10.862
If you insist.

48:10.864 --> 48:12.697
Turn off
all the underwater lighting.

48:12.699 --> 48:14.732
Restrict the crew
to essential areas.

48:14.734 --> 48:17.368
You said it was impossible
for it to get up here.

48:17.370 --> 48:18.936
It should have been.

48:18.938 --> 48:20.738
You guys,
take a look at this.

48:20.740 --> 48:23.075
When the glider came up,
the thermocline was intact,

48:23.077 --> 48:25.210
so it was
one degree Celsius, right?

48:25.212 --> 48:26.744
Yeah.

48:26.746 --> 48:28.913
But a minute later,
when the <i>Evolution</i> came up,

48:28.915 --> 48:31.016
the temperature increased
by 25 degrees.

48:31.018 --> 48:33.384
A shark could come
right through there.

48:33.386 --> 48:35.620
20 sharks for that matter.

48:35.622 --> 48:36.821
When the meg hit the <i>Origin,</i>

48:36.823 --> 48:38.290
it slammed into
a thermal vent.

48:38.292 --> 48:40.858
Those can release millions
of gallons per minute.

48:40.860 --> 48:42.927
The heat from that vent
cleared the path

48:42.929 --> 48:44.662
through the freezing
cold layer.

48:44.664 --> 48:45.863
Are you saying we opened up

48:45.865 --> 48:47.366
a super highway
for giant sharks?

48:47.368 --> 48:50.534
Not exactly. It seems like
it was a transitory event.

48:50.536 --> 48:51.769
The temperatures
are returned to normal

48:51.771 --> 48:53.404
and the gap is closed.

48:53.406 --> 48:56.574
Yeah. But not before a massive
prehistoric killing machine

48:56.576 --> 48:58.076
decided to come up
and say "Hi."

48:58.078 --> 49:00.478
Hey, look, we're wasting time.
That thing's out there.

49:00.480 --> 49:01.948
We need to find it
and kill it.

49:02.383 --> 49:03.881
No.

49:03.883 --> 49:08.353
We can't. We should explore
non-lethal options first.

49:08.355 --> 49:10.122
For the meg or for us?

49:11.858 --> 49:13.058
<i>Attention.</i>

49:13.060 --> 49:15.426
I've got
an emergency locator beacon.

49:15.428 --> 49:17.095
20 miles south, southwest.

49:17.097 --> 49:18.297
What does that mean?

49:18.299 --> 49:19.797
It means
a boat has gone down.

49:19.799 --> 49:21.632
<i>- Attention.</i>
- Three boats.

49:21.634 --> 49:25.538
That's the meg.
We need to get there. Now.

49:40.453 --> 49:43.090
Mac! I found something!

50:01.541 --> 50:03.375
These sharks have no fins.

50:03.377 --> 50:05.843
They were killed
by shark poachers.

50:05.845 --> 50:08.715
They cut off the fins and
throw the shark back to die.

50:09.782 --> 50:12.550
All for a bowl of soup.

50:12.552 --> 50:14.221
Looks like the meg
evened the score.

50:19.525 --> 50:20.960
One fish did all this?

50:22.196 --> 50:23.696
Ask it yourself.

50:26.566 --> 50:27.965
Okay.

50:27.967 --> 50:30.601
We have a shark cage
and spearguns on board.

50:30.603 --> 50:32.237
If we can shoot the meg

50:32.239 --> 50:34.006
in a soft spot
like it's mouth or gills,

50:34.008 --> 50:36.108
we can inject it
with something lethal.

50:36.110 --> 50:37.376
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

50:37.378 --> 50:39.111
It's gonna take at least
20 minutes to rig the cage.

50:39.113 --> 50:40.811
And that thing
will be gone in two.

50:40.813 --> 50:42.548
Why don't you just
put a tracker on it?

50:44.884 --> 50:46.550
Don't you guys
ever watch <i>Shark Week?</i>

50:46.552 --> 50:51.356
You have one of those, like,
GPS tracker tag thingamajigs.

50:51.358 --> 50:53.325
Keep an eye on the shark
till the cage is ready.

50:53.327 --> 50:55.293
We should be able
to put a tracking dart

50:55.295 --> 50:56.428
in that dorsal fin.

50:56.430 --> 50:57.528
You're welcome.

50:57.530 --> 50:59.164
Yeah, but somehow

50:59.166 --> 51:00.731
we have to get this boat
next to that meg.

51:00.733 --> 51:02.401
No, we can't.

51:02.403 --> 51:05.137
It's already proven
aggressive towards boats.

51:05.139 --> 51:07.472
The safest way to approach
is without a vehicle.

51:07.474 --> 51:08.639
Hold up. Hold up.

51:08.641 --> 51:10.142
You want someone
to swim out there?

51:10.144 --> 51:12.810
To a prehistoric shark
that ate our friend?

51:12.812 --> 51:15.280
Actually, one of us alone
in the water is no threat.

51:15.282 --> 51:17.917
Okay, who the hell
is gonna make that swim?

51:20.120 --> 51:21.353
Let's draw straws.

51:21.355 --> 51:22.922
I can't swim.

51:25.558 --> 51:26.791
Uh...

51:26.793 --> 51:29.862
Sorry, my body
made me say that.

51:31.198 --> 51:33.133
You sure about this?

51:35.536 --> 51:38.336
Not really.

51:38.338 --> 51:41.041
If I get eaten,
you're gonna feel really bad.

51:47.014 --> 51:50.284
This tracker rifle
only has a 100-foot range.

51:51.018 --> 51:52.150
100 feet?

51:52.152 --> 51:54.054
Get really close
before you shoot.

51:55.055 --> 51:56.620
Great.

51:56.622 --> 51:58.722
If you want me
to go instead, I will.

51:58.724 --> 52:00.559
I got this, Mac.

52:00.561 --> 52:02.360
Okay, good,
'cause I was lying.

52:02.362 --> 52:03.661
Be safe.

52:03.663 --> 52:05.165
Yeah, thanks, pal.

52:08.235 --> 52:10.204
I hope you're right
about this.

52:11.138 --> 52:12.372
Me, too.

52:24.351 --> 52:26.053
I'm an idiot.

52:37.897 --> 52:41.566
I am proceeding to
the enormous killer shark.

52:41.568 --> 52:43.335
Yeah, we got you, Jonas.

52:43.337 --> 52:46.371
<i>Sharks are
attracted to panic motion.</i>

52:46.373 --> 52:48.175
<i>Keep it nice and smooth.</i>

52:58.519 --> 53:00.387
It's all gonna be fine.

53:22.176 --> 53:24.877
Oh, boy,
it's going under.

54:24.371 --> 54:25.570
He's done it.

54:25.572 --> 54:27.205
Mac, tracker is live!

54:27.207 --> 54:28.475
Great!
Reel him in, DJ.

54:35.515 --> 54:36.581
Stop! Stop!

54:36.583 --> 54:38.352
No vibration!

54:40.153 --> 54:42.721
Oh, shit. I'm in trouble.

54:42.723 --> 54:44.089
Jonas, it's coming at you.

54:44.091 --> 54:46.725
You think I didn't notice?

54:46.727 --> 54:48.195
Start the boat!
Start the boat!

54:54.468 --> 54:56.236
Pull him in.

55:12.286 --> 55:14.521
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on!

55:33.040 --> 55:35.140
You might be
a son of a bitch,

55:35.142 --> 55:37.010
but you're sure as hell
no coward.

55:37.477 --> 55:38.809
Good job.

55:54.127 --> 55:57.996
I prepared the spearheads
to inject etorphine.

55:57.998 --> 56:00.864
A killer whale is knocked
out with 10 CCs.

56:00.866 --> 56:03.501
Dead with 20.
What do you think?

56:03.503 --> 56:06.239
I think we use
the whole damn bottle.

56:07.641 --> 56:10.908
Remind me again
why this is a good idea.

56:10.910 --> 56:13.178
What?
It's a shark cage.

56:13.180 --> 56:15.180
Plastic shark cage.

56:15.182 --> 56:17.649
I'm gonna ignore
that you just said that.

56:17.651 --> 56:20.085
This beautiful thing
is polycarbonate,

56:20.087 --> 56:22.721
specifically designed
not to crack,

56:22.723 --> 56:25.256
not to break, but to deform.

56:25.258 --> 56:27.225
And in this case,
at this thickness,

56:27.227 --> 56:31.096
it would take 20,000 pounds
per square inch.

56:31.098 --> 56:33.098
And if you're talking
about breaking,

56:33.100 --> 56:35.635
that's eight to nine
hundred thousand.

56:39.106 --> 56:40.507
I don't like it.

56:44.845 --> 56:46.511
Doesn't like it.

56:46.513 --> 56:48.215
I wouldn't get in there.

56:50.050 --> 56:51.284
Keep it coming.

56:55.355 --> 56:57.023
That's good!

57:04.631 --> 57:05.665
Hey.

57:06.700 --> 57:09.000
What did he say?

57:09.002 --> 57:10.835
He said, "be careful."

57:10.837 --> 57:13.138
That's his version
of I love you.

57:13.140 --> 57:14.938
Your father has
a lot of faith in you.

57:14.940 --> 57:18.111
I've done
hundreds of shark dives.

57:19.746 --> 57:21.914
Not like this.

57:22.449 --> 57:23.583
Yes.

57:24.284 --> 57:26.317
But I know shark anatomy.

57:26.319 --> 57:27.951
And I know where this

57:27.953 --> 57:30.624
can penetrate through
megalodon skin.

57:33.193 --> 57:35.727
- Suyin, let me go instead...
- Hey.

57:35.729 --> 57:38.665
Don't worry about me.
Let me do what I do best.

58:25.111 --> 58:26.678
<i>Everything okay up there?</i>

58:26.680 --> 58:29.314
<i>Just a fresh
round of chum,</i>

58:29.316 --> 58:32.317
so you,
you know, taste good.

58:32.319 --> 58:34.986
<i>I'm so glad
you're looking out for me.</i>

58:34.988 --> 58:37.491
Thank you.
Bye-bye. Good luck.

59:03.617 --> 59:05.116
<i>What's happening
down there?</i>

59:05.118 --> 59:06.684
<i>You okay?</i>

59:06.686 --> 59:08.753
<i>Yeah. I'm okay.</i>

59:08.755 --> 59:12.325
<i>Just some teeny,
tiny eight-foot sharks.</i>

59:19.165 --> 59:21.599
<i>Here we go.</i>

59:23.270 --> 59:24.702
We've got her attention.

59:24.704 --> 59:26.504
Suyin, it's on its way.

59:26.506 --> 59:28.074
- 50 meters.
- 50 meters.

59:31.044 --> 59:32.312
<i>30.</i>

59:34.114 --> 59:35.213
<i>10 meters.</i>

59:53.300 --> 59:54.501
<i>Okay.</i>

59:56.003 --> 59:58.303
<i>Wow.</i>

59:58.305 --> 01:00:00.707
<i>I'm going to try
to hit it in the eye.</i>

01:00:03.044 --> 01:00:04.578
<i>Damn it.</i>

01:00:16.356 --> 01:00:17.922
Whoa! Watch it.

01:00:17.924 --> 01:00:19.225
Whoa! Hey!

01:00:29.569 --> 01:00:31.504
Oh, sh...

01:00:39.512 --> 01:00:42.047
<i>Yes!
The poison is in.</i>

01:00:42.049 --> 01:00:44.517
<i>Okay, Suyin,
hang in there.</i>

01:00:47.821 --> 01:00:50.321
<i>I'm trapped!
I'm in its mouth!</i>

01:00:50.323 --> 01:00:51.956
That cage will not break.

01:00:51.958 --> 01:00:55.328
<i>That's the problem.
The cage is being swallowed.</i>

01:01:09.043 --> 01:01:10.575
Hell, yeah!

01:01:21.187 --> 01:01:23.590
- Not this again.
- Oh, man. Oh, man.

01:01:50.051 --> 01:01:54.187
<i>New problem. My mask
is broken. I'm losing air.</i>

01:02:01.261 --> 01:02:02.796
Help!

01:02:06.199 --> 01:02:07.400
Help!

01:02:12.472 --> 01:02:14.274
Come on, Jaxx!

01:02:18.712 --> 01:02:21.247
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:02:26.753 --> 01:02:28.087
<i>No, Jonas.</i>

01:02:28.089 --> 01:02:30.390
<i>Go! Get back to the ship.</i>

01:02:31.158 --> 01:02:32.859
<i>It's not safe for you.</i>

01:02:35.462 --> 01:02:37.764
<i>Jonas, go back.</i>

01:02:38.765 --> 01:02:39.866
<i>Jonas.</i>

01:02:49.876 --> 01:02:52.111
<i>Jonas,
the crane's in the water!</i>

01:02:52.113 --> 01:02:54.414
<i>It's gonna pull her
to the bottom. Hurry!</i>

01:02:58.052 --> 01:02:59.985
Swing the second crane over.

01:02:59.987 --> 01:03:02.756
We're gonna set a trap.
Guys, I need some bait.

01:03:24.878 --> 01:03:26.344
Come on. Got him!

01:03:26.346 --> 01:03:27.881
Whoa!

01:04:16.596 --> 01:04:18.431
Over here!

01:04:20.466 --> 01:04:23.103
This way. Throw a rope.

01:04:24.271 --> 01:04:25.672
She's not breathing.

01:05:11.051 --> 01:05:12.251
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:05:12.253 --> 01:05:13.718
Take it easy.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:15.055
You were dead a minute ago.

01:05:15.788 --> 01:05:17.124
Doctor.

01:05:21.128 --> 01:05:23.694
You got me out.

01:05:23.696 --> 01:05:25.698
It was closer
than I woulda liked.

01:05:27.167 --> 01:05:29.936
Can I have
a minute with Jonas?

01:05:31.205 --> 01:05:32.538
Sure.

01:05:45.418 --> 01:05:48.588
You saved me. Again.

01:05:49.522 --> 01:05:51.125
I prefer you alive.

01:05:54.961 --> 01:05:57.430
There's something
you might wanna see.

01:05:58.765 --> 01:06:00.464
Wow.

01:06:00.466 --> 01:06:01.701
Wow.

01:06:11.444 --> 01:06:13.778
- Hey! Look who's up.
- Hey.

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:16.849
- How are ya?
- I'm better. Thank you.

01:06:17.850 --> 01:06:19.650
Jonas, get a picture of me

01:06:19.652 --> 01:06:21.485
with this big smelly beast.

01:06:21.487 --> 01:06:23.821
Okay. Wait. Here.

01:06:23.823 --> 01:06:25.090
Hey, you want
a proper picture,

01:06:25.092 --> 01:06:26.559
get your head inside.

01:06:27.261 --> 01:06:28.526
- Closer.
- Closer?

01:06:28.528 --> 01:06:29.927
Come on. Get in.

01:06:29.929 --> 01:06:30.795
Okay.

01:06:30.797 --> 01:06:32.932
Ugh!

01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:38.836
Nice one.

01:06:38.838 --> 01:06:41.505
Yo, Jonas, please tell me
you got that.

01:06:41.507 --> 01:06:43.210
I got that, DJ.

01:06:44.244 --> 01:06:45.576
That's not funny, man!

01:06:45.578 --> 01:06:46.777
No, like seriously,
it's funny.

01:06:46.779 --> 01:06:48.781
Look. Watch this.

01:06:57.257 --> 01:06:58.758
Hey, Suyin.

01:06:59.892 --> 01:07:01.661
Look at him next to the meg.

01:07:02.895 --> 01:07:06.897
Look, remember the bite marks
on the O-Level?

01:07:06.899 --> 01:07:08.699
Well, how do you like that?

01:07:08.701 --> 01:07:11.569
That was a serious
man vs. nature moment.

01:07:11.571 --> 01:07:13.840
I'm just glad
things went our way.

01:07:14.707 --> 01:07:16.609
It didn't go our way.

01:07:17.610 --> 01:07:19.146
Not for Toshi.

01:07:20.481 --> 01:07:22.682
And not for science.

01:07:23.683 --> 01:07:26.318
We did what people always do.

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:29.990
Discover and then destroy.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.126
Ugh.

01:07:34.128 --> 01:07:35.760
Hey, I will end you.

01:07:35.762 --> 01:07:37.528
At least you can use this
as your dating app pic.

01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:39.031
Give you a little leg,
you know.

01:07:39.033 --> 01:07:40.165
Yeah!

01:07:40.167 --> 01:07:41.966
Oh, yeah!

01:07:41.968 --> 01:07:43.569
- Jellyfish.
- Whoo-hoo!

01:08:23.776 --> 01:08:25.977
Two! There's two?

01:08:25.979 --> 01:08:27.680
Nobody said there were two.

01:08:28.549 --> 01:08:30.515
How are there two?

01:08:30.517 --> 01:08:31.916
Help me!
Get me out of this water!

01:08:31.917 --> 01:08:34.352
Help! Somebody help, please!

01:08:34.354 --> 01:08:35.786
Help!

01:08:35.787 --> 01:08:37.255
What is wrong with you?

01:08:37.256 --> 01:08:39.424
I can't... I can't swim.

01:08:39.426 --> 01:08:41.326
No! Get outta here! Really?

01:08:41.328 --> 01:08:43.095
Don't pull that
racist stuff on me.

01:08:43.096 --> 01:08:44.129
Oh, come on, man.

01:08:44.131 --> 01:08:45.796
Give me a break.
I'm not being racist.

01:08:45.798 --> 01:08:50.167
You work, literally,
in the middle of the ocean.

01:08:50.170 --> 01:08:52.069
This wasn't
part of the job description.

01:08:52.072 --> 01:08:54.538
None of this was part
of the job description!

01:08:54.541 --> 01:08:56.176
They left that part out!

01:09:07.653 --> 01:09:08.919
It's time
to get some real help.

01:09:08.921 --> 01:09:10.621
Yeah. Go get some help.

01:09:13.227 --> 01:09:14.526
I'm quitting.

01:09:14.528 --> 01:09:17.029
Mac! Give me a hand.

01:09:21.901 --> 01:09:25.002
Hey, I need you
to find my location.

01:09:25.005 --> 01:09:27.538
Track my sat phone.
There's a second shark.

01:09:27.541 --> 01:09:29.107
Yes, two.

01:09:29.109 --> 01:09:30.741
How the hell should I know?

01:09:30.743 --> 01:09:32.843
Just hurry up
and get us some help.

01:09:32.845 --> 01:09:33.979
Thank you, Jonas. Thank you.

01:09:33.981 --> 01:09:35.247
Bring whatever
you got!

01:09:35.249 --> 01:09:37.381
Just relax. Relax.

01:09:37.384 --> 01:09:38.948
It's not good.

01:09:38.951 --> 01:09:40.818
He needs a hospital fast.

01:09:40.819 --> 01:09:43.255
Let's get the doctor.
Where's Doctor Heller?

01:09:44.657 --> 01:09:45.858
Jaxx?

01:09:46.627 --> 01:09:48.627
Jaxx, you okay?

01:09:48.629 --> 01:09:50.863
Yeah! Kind of.

01:09:53.399 --> 01:09:54.832
Jaxx...

01:09:54.834 --> 01:09:56.667
We can do this.

01:09:56.669 --> 01:09:58.338
Swim gently back to the boat.

01:09:58.938 --> 01:10:00.840
Nice and easy.

01:10:05.912 --> 01:10:07.646
Here it comes!

01:10:07.648 --> 01:10:08.915
Heller!

01:10:09.583 --> 01:10:11.218
We're not gonna make it.

01:10:12.586 --> 01:10:13.884
Jaxx.

01:10:13.886 --> 01:10:15.287
You're gonna be okay.

01:10:15.289 --> 01:10:18.192
- You're a good person, Jaxx.
- Wait, what?

01:10:18.891 --> 01:10:20.358
Don't look back.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.759
- Hey!
- No!

01:10:21.761 --> 01:10:22.860
Heller, no!

01:10:22.862 --> 01:10:24.296
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

01:10:24.298 --> 01:10:26.031
Hey, come on!

01:10:26.033 --> 01:10:29.102
Hey! Hey, come on!

01:10:29.702 --> 01:10:30.903
Hey!

01:10:33.407 --> 01:10:35.242
Heller!

01:10:44.518 --> 01:10:46.750
Almost there.

01:10:46.752 --> 01:10:49.189
- Come on.
- We got you.

01:10:51.924 --> 01:10:54.825
It's okay, Jaxx.

01:10:54.827 --> 01:10:56.396
You're gonna be okay.

01:11:03.736 --> 01:11:08.340
Thank you, Heller, thank you.

01:11:08.342 --> 01:11:11.009
What was that?
What the hell was that?

01:11:11.011 --> 01:11:13.178
- Okay, come on, DJ.
- No! No!

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:15.146
This is why we don't
leave the station, okay?

01:11:15.148 --> 01:11:16.982
That's why you don't do that!

01:11:16.984 --> 01:11:19.384
And you went down there
and you pissed it off,

01:11:19.386 --> 01:11:22.153
now it's gonna come back
and kill every one of us!

01:11:22.155 --> 01:11:23.622
Now what are we
supposed to do?

01:11:23.624 --> 01:11:25.357
I shouldn't even be out here
in the first place.

01:11:25.359 --> 01:11:28.226
Swimming in this ocean.
That one ate the other one.

01:11:28.228 --> 01:11:30.295
Is another one
gonna eat this one?

01:11:30.297 --> 01:11:32.199
Man, it's...

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:35.300
It just killed Heller.

01:11:35.302 --> 01:11:38.438
It killed The Wall.
It killed Toshi.

01:11:40.806 --> 01:11:43.010
These are my friends, man.

01:11:51.917 --> 01:11:53.118
Okay,
can I just point out

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.519
that this thing is sinking?

01:11:54.521 --> 01:11:55.819
What are we gonna do now?

01:11:55.821 --> 01:11:57.057
Where's Mac?

01:12:12.172 --> 01:12:13.173
Yes!

01:12:27.688 --> 01:12:29.654
What happened to your hair?

01:12:29.656 --> 01:12:30.991
What happened to your hair?

01:12:31.857 --> 01:12:33.126
Touche.

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:36.096
Guys!

01:12:38.864 --> 01:12:40.267
That thing is the devil.

01:12:41.301 --> 01:12:43.501
10 miles, it's still with us.

01:12:43.503 --> 01:12:45.170
You got us?

01:12:45.172 --> 01:12:47.339
The ocean. The middle
of a freaking ocean!

01:12:47.341 --> 01:12:48.807
Do you think
it'd slow down the shark

01:12:48.809 --> 01:12:51.144
if we threw him over?

01:12:52.212 --> 01:12:54.679
You got to work on yourself.

01:12:54.681 --> 01:12:55.913
Okay. Good news, guys.

01:12:55.915 --> 01:12:57.351
It's payback time.

01:12:58.985 --> 01:13:00.953
Oh, yeah!

01:13:33.387 --> 01:13:34.819
Yes! Get some!

01:13:34.821 --> 01:13:36.554
You seriously think
that a rifle

01:13:36.556 --> 01:13:37.555
is gonna hurt that thing?

01:13:37.557 --> 01:13:39.457
I didn't have
much notice, okay?

01:13:39.459 --> 01:13:41.995
I just wanted to get it
off our backs.

01:13:42.796 --> 01:13:43.995
Well done, Morris.

01:13:43.997 --> 01:13:45.298
Whoo!

01:15:35.175 --> 01:15:36.307
It's okay.

01:15:36.309 --> 01:15:38.678
Mummy! Mummy!

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.082
Welcome back, Mummy.

01:16:31.032 --> 01:16:32.332
Come in.

01:16:38.238 --> 01:16:39.673
How's Meiying?

01:16:41.141 --> 01:16:43.074
She's sad.

01:16:43.076 --> 01:16:45.445
And confused.

01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:48.248
How are you?

01:16:50.051 --> 01:16:52.819
I really don't want
to accept it.

01:16:55.555 --> 01:17:00.358
Sometimes things happen
that change your life forever.

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.995
Meanwhile,
the world just keeps going.

01:17:02.997 --> 01:17:07.400
You think maybe it would stop
just for a second...

01:17:09.903 --> 01:17:11.769
But it doesn't.

01:17:11.771 --> 01:17:13.640
How do you live with it?

01:17:15.042 --> 01:17:16.276
I don't.

01:17:17.243 --> 01:17:20.945
I left my two best friends
to die.

01:17:20.947 --> 01:17:23.848
I think about it
all the time.

01:17:23.850 --> 01:17:25.652
Every day I replay it.

01:17:26.886 --> 01:17:29.554
Could I have done more?

01:17:29.556 --> 01:17:32.592
It's not just about
the ones you lose.

01:17:34.494 --> 01:17:38.565
It's also about
the ones you save.

01:17:43.803 --> 01:17:45.605
I'm glad you're here.

01:17:57.751 --> 01:18:00.718
I've informed the Chinese
government about the meg.

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:03.521
As well as the authorities
in Thailand,

01:18:03.523 --> 01:18:05.823
Vietnam, Indonesia,
and Australia.

01:18:05.825 --> 01:18:09.995
The Chinese are sending
two destroyers to take it out.

01:18:09.997 --> 01:18:12.430
So, this is now officially

01:18:12.432 --> 01:18:15.201
and thankfully
out of our hands.

01:18:17.904 --> 01:18:19.506
I'm closing <i>Mana One</i>

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:22.807
until the meg is killed

01:18:22.809 --> 01:18:27.178
and an evacuation ship is
coming here tomorrow morning.

01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:28.746
You damn right.

01:18:28.748 --> 01:18:31.551
And finally,
I just want to say

01:18:36.157 --> 01:18:39.859
I'm sorry for your losses.

01:18:41.028 --> 01:18:42.829
Your friends.

01:18:44.597 --> 01:18:47.267
I came here
to celebrate with you,

01:18:49.636 --> 01:18:51.771
and now I'm mourning with you.

01:19:05.685 --> 01:19:07.587
Thanks for saving our asses.

01:19:16.930 --> 01:19:18.863
What do you got for me?

01:19:18.865 --> 01:19:21.866
These are Semtex high velocity
demolition charges.

01:19:21.868 --> 01:19:24.969
I had the men rig delay fuses
to give them time to sink.

01:19:24.971 --> 01:19:27.540
Essentially,
they're depth charges.

01:19:29.375 --> 01:19:30.908
That's right.

01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:34.245
I'm not sure this is
a advisable course of action.

01:19:34.247 --> 01:19:37.615
Every person that gets maimed
or killed by that thing

01:19:37.617 --> 01:19:39.017
is a potential lawsuit.

01:19:39.019 --> 01:19:40.520
A potential casualty.

01:19:41.888 --> 01:19:44.756
Relax, bro.
It's gonna be fun.

01:19:48.394 --> 01:19:51.763
- I can see your cards.
- Well, look at you two crooks.

01:19:51.765 --> 01:19:52.998
Hey.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.932
How are you feeling?

01:19:54.934 --> 01:19:55.967
Like I got off easy,

01:19:55.969 --> 01:19:57.437
compared to
the rest of you guys.

01:19:58.072 --> 01:19:59.305
Mmm.

01:20:00.007 --> 01:20:01.472
What do you got up there?

01:20:01.474 --> 01:20:02.673
Three kings.

01:20:02.675 --> 01:20:05.943
What? Come on! Every time.

01:20:05.945 --> 01:20:08.113
You owe me
a soda for that one.

01:20:08.115 --> 01:20:09.914
Fine.

01:20:09.916 --> 01:20:12.050
We'll square up
when you get back, okay?

01:20:12.052 --> 01:20:14.819
Fine. Fine. Fine.

01:20:14.821 --> 01:20:16.854
Just trying to take her mind
off things, you know.

01:20:16.856 --> 01:20:18.892
She's tougher than me,
that's for sure.

01:20:22.762 --> 01:20:24.829
I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

01:20:24.831 --> 01:20:27.365
Well, you didn't
call me crazy.

01:20:27.367 --> 01:20:29.168
Yeah, but I didn't
call you sane.

01:20:29.170 --> 01:20:32.472
Yeah, well, "sane" wasn't
a word I heard very often.

01:20:34.474 --> 01:20:36.141
So, what now?

01:20:36.143 --> 01:20:38.876
I don't know.
Go back to Thailand, I guess.

01:20:38.878 --> 01:20:40.945
Mac told me
about you and Suyin.

01:20:40.947 --> 01:20:44.782
- Nothing to tell.
- Well, maybe there could be.

01:20:44.784 --> 01:20:46.084
You and Mac are unbelievable.

01:20:46.086 --> 01:20:49.054
How about you just
try something new?

01:20:49.056 --> 01:20:51.389
So the rest of your life
isn't a vast wasteland

01:20:51.391 --> 01:20:54.159
of misery and solitude.

01:20:54.161 --> 01:20:56.561
I think that's a good idea.

01:20:56.563 --> 01:20:57.895
You do, huh?

01:20:57.897 --> 01:20:59.764
Eight-year-olds
hear everything.

01:20:59.766 --> 01:21:01.968
Jonas...

01:21:05.572 --> 01:21:07.907
My mom likes you, too.

01:21:12.478 --> 01:21:15.615
This is possibly
the worst moment of my life.

01:21:18.551 --> 01:21:20.185
<i>Approaching target area.</i>

01:21:20.187 --> 01:21:21.588
<i>I'll confirm visual.</i>

01:21:23.823 --> 01:21:26.058
Let me make myself
absolutely clear.

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.693
We are not getting within
a mile of that monster

01:21:28.695 --> 01:21:30.728
until the helicopter kills it.

01:21:30.730 --> 01:21:32.864
<i>We have a visual
on the target.</i>

01:21:32.866 --> 01:21:34.398
Stop the boat.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.602
Stop the boat.

01:21:38.504 --> 01:21:40.440
<i>Deploying
depth charges.</i>

01:21:54.387 --> 01:21:55.655
We got him.

01:21:57.258 --> 01:21:58.589
Hit it again.

01:21:58.591 --> 01:21:59.657
<i>Sir,
there's no way possible...</i>

01:21:59.659 --> 01:22:00.860
Hit it again.

01:22:07.334 --> 01:22:10.601
<i>Target is dead.
Repeat, target is dead.</i>

01:22:10.603 --> 01:22:12.204
Are you absolutely sure?

01:22:12.206 --> 01:22:13.372
Because I'm not getting eaten

01:22:13.374 --> 01:22:15.107
by some goddamn
prehistoric fish.

01:22:15.109 --> 01:22:17.675
<i>Affirmative, sir.
There's, uh...</i>

01:22:17.677 --> 01:22:20.444
Well, there's pieces of it
all over the place.

01:22:20.446 --> 01:22:22.546
<i>Shark chunks?</i>

01:22:22.548 --> 01:22:24.249
That's a good sign.

01:22:24.251 --> 01:22:27.021
All right. Take us in.

01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:35.994
Oh!

01:22:35.996 --> 01:22:38.063
Jump down there,
get me a couple of teeth.

01:22:38.065 --> 01:22:39.131
Big ones for my desk.

01:22:39.133 --> 01:22:41.201
- All right.
- Keep one for yourself.

01:22:42.169 --> 01:22:43.770
Nice.

01:22:46.739 --> 01:22:48.208
Oh, you seeing this?

01:22:49.609 --> 01:22:50.843
Crazy.

01:22:56.050 --> 01:22:57.850
That's sick.

01:23:03.190 --> 01:23:04.557
That's weird.

01:23:09.896 --> 01:23:12.630
Oh, man!
Don't do that to me.

01:23:12.632 --> 01:23:14.532
That thing
doesn't have any teeth.

01:23:14.534 --> 01:23:16.168
What?

01:23:16.170 --> 01:23:17.737
I think we killed a whale.

01:23:20.807 --> 01:23:22.608
It's right below us.

01:23:23.509 --> 01:23:24.777
Get us outta here!

01:23:29.849 --> 01:23:32.317
Wait! Wait,
you idiots! Wait!

01:23:32.319 --> 01:23:34.254
I'm over here! Wait!

01:23:36.656 --> 01:23:38.958
Oh, no!

01:23:59.446 --> 01:24:00.747
Oh!

01:24:12.925 --> 01:24:16.529
Yeah, I understand.
I understand, yep. Thank you.

01:24:18.399 --> 01:24:20.765
Let me guess,
Morris never called anyone.

01:24:20.767 --> 01:24:22.034
Didn't call anyone.

01:24:22.036 --> 01:24:23.701
No one knows
the shark's out there.

01:24:23.703 --> 01:24:25.504
No one. Not the Australians,

01:24:25.506 --> 01:24:26.837
not the Chinese. No one.

01:24:26.839 --> 01:24:28.340
The hell was he thinking?

01:24:28.342 --> 01:24:30.775
He wanted to make this go away
as quietly as possible.

01:24:30.777 --> 01:24:31.942
Mac, we need
to let everyone...

01:24:31.944 --> 01:24:33.345
Let everyone know.
Yeah, I'm on it.

01:24:33.347 --> 01:24:34.845
Jaxx, can you find that thing?

01:24:34.847 --> 01:24:36.481
Wait, wait, wait.
Why're you asking her that?

01:24:36.483 --> 01:24:38.803
I don't like the fact that you
asking her about that thing.

01:24:39.752 --> 01:24:41.119
You want me
to illegally hack

01:24:41.121 --> 01:24:42.920
into Morris' satellite
tracking system

01:24:42.922 --> 01:24:45.457
- to find a prehistoric shark?
- Yeah.

01:24:45.459 --> 01:24:46.957
Okay.

01:24:46.959 --> 01:24:49.394
We use a tracker,
find the meg, and we kill it.

01:24:49.396 --> 01:24:50.596
Bro.

01:24:52.632 --> 01:24:54.032
We really gonna do this?

01:24:54.034 --> 01:24:55.933
A lot of people are gonna die
if we don't, Mac.

01:24:55.935 --> 01:24:57.436
- Well, I'm in.
- Me, too.

01:24:57.438 --> 01:24:59.204
Let's do this.

01:24:59.206 --> 01:25:01.639
How do you feel about
commandeering that evac ship?

01:25:01.641 --> 01:25:03.808
I'd say,

01:25:03.810 --> 01:25:05.645
it's a great day
to go fishing.

01:25:06.779 --> 01:25:07.979
Now let's get
everything on it.

01:25:07.981 --> 01:25:09.947
Construction explosives,
gliders.

01:25:09.949 --> 01:25:11.349
The whole lot. Everything.

01:25:11.351 --> 01:25:13.385
Because we're about
to evac, right?

01:25:13.387 --> 01:25:14.685
Like evacuate?

01:25:14.687 --> 01:25:16.854
Like, leave the area
of imminent danger

01:25:16.856 --> 01:25:20.827
and go to a safe place
like normal people?

01:25:31.472 --> 01:25:32.903
What we got, Jaxx?
Anything?

01:25:32.905 --> 01:25:35.606
Yeah. Here's where we saw
Morris attack the shark.

01:25:35.608 --> 01:25:38.276
But here is where it's going.

01:25:38.278 --> 01:25:39.743
Sanya Bay. What's there?

01:25:39.745 --> 01:25:40.878
Oh, nothing.

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:42.180
It only has some of the most

01:25:42.182 --> 01:25:44.149
densely populated beaches
in the world.

01:25:44.151 --> 01:25:45.550
Any luck with the authorities?

01:25:45.552 --> 01:25:46.985
No.

01:25:46.987 --> 01:25:49.387
"Prehistoric shark" sounds
like a damn prank call.

01:25:49.389 --> 01:25:51.423
We can't rely on them
for anything.

01:25:51.425 --> 01:25:53.425
How long until the
shark gets to those people?

01:25:53.427 --> 01:25:54.625
20 minutes.

01:25:54.627 --> 01:25:56.428
- Can we get there first?
- Doubtful.

01:25:56.430 --> 01:25:57.761
Yeah, we're gonna have to.

01:25:57.763 --> 01:25:58.896
Getting there first
won't mean anything

01:25:58.898 --> 01:26:00.465
if we don't have a plan.

01:26:00.467 --> 01:26:02.369
Maybe we have a plan.

01:26:05.239 --> 01:26:07.905
Here's where we do it.
Right here in the shallows.

01:26:07.907 --> 01:26:09.673
Use the gliders
and go after it.

01:26:09.675 --> 01:26:11.610
Okay, so, how are we
gonna get it here,

01:26:11.612 --> 01:26:14.379
when there's a beach full
of people to eat right here?

01:26:14.381 --> 01:26:16.816
You ask it out for dinner.

01:26:29.029 --> 01:26:31.697
So...
How do you wanna do this?

01:26:32.599 --> 01:26:34.134
Is that you asking my opinion?

01:26:34.767 --> 01:26:35.966
No.

01:26:35.968 --> 01:26:37.569
I was just being polite

01:26:37.571 --> 01:26:40.804
before telling you
what we're actually doing,

01:26:40.806 --> 01:26:42.574
so you feel
better about yourself.

01:26:42.576 --> 01:26:43.943
Appreciate that.

01:26:51.151 --> 01:26:52.152
What?

01:26:52.619 --> 01:26:54.286
Nothing.

01:26:54.288 --> 01:26:55.355
We're ready.

01:28:18.272 --> 01:28:20.438
Pippin!

01:29:46.626 --> 01:29:48.128
Oh, my God!

01:29:59.439 --> 01:30:01.373
We're close enough.
Stop here.

01:30:01.375 --> 01:30:03.608
Jaxx, DJ, we gotta get
that thing in the water.

01:30:03.610 --> 01:30:04.644
Yeah, we're on it.

01:31:01.601 --> 01:31:05.305
Shark! Shark!

01:33:10.597 --> 01:33:12.730
<i>Any last
thoughts about our plan?</i>

01:33:12.732 --> 01:33:14.799
Not dying
would be a good start.

01:33:14.801 --> 01:33:17.268
Finally,
we agree on something.

01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:19.504
<i>Let's not make it a habit.</i>

01:33:19.506 --> 01:33:21.308
<i>Suyin, look out!
Get out of there!</i>

01:33:32.252 --> 01:33:33.751
- Damn it!
- What's wrong, Jonas?

01:33:33.753 --> 01:33:36.289
Can't make the shot.
It's too close to the ship.

01:33:37.657 --> 01:33:38.692
Jesus!

01:33:41.062 --> 01:33:42.660
<i>Jonas, it's on you.</i>

01:33:42.662 --> 01:33:43.697
Mac!

01:33:47.068 --> 01:33:48.566
Jonas, what's going on
down there?

01:33:48.568 --> 01:33:50.570
Trying to stay
out of its mouth.

01:34:12.225 --> 01:34:13.426
Jeez!

01:34:21.267 --> 01:34:22.535
Oops.

01:34:24.404 --> 01:34:25.970
<i>Suyin, are you set?
I'm coming to you.</i>

01:34:25.972 --> 01:34:27.672
I'm in position.

01:34:27.674 --> 01:34:29.108
<i>Shark's getting close.</i>

01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:30.810
I need a little
breathing room.

01:34:37.118 --> 01:34:39.486
- I'm ready to fire.
<i>- Take the shot.</i>

01:34:41.287 --> 01:34:42.522
<i>Move! Move!</i>

01:35:03.376 --> 01:35:05.677
Anybody see it?

01:35:05.679 --> 01:35:07.445
<i>Can't see the shark, but
something's going on up here.</i>

01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:19.926
<i>Okay,
I've got her attention.</i>

01:35:23.196 --> 01:35:24.397
Bring her to me.

01:35:24.999 --> 01:35:26.266
Here we come.

01:35:29.235 --> 01:35:31.271
Make your move, Suyin.

01:35:34.674 --> 01:35:36.910
Chew on this,
you ugly bastard.

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:41.982
No, no, no! Shit!

01:35:44.085 --> 01:35:45.285
Jeez!

01:36:09.809 --> 01:36:12.645
No, no, no. Go! Go! Go!

01:36:24.324 --> 01:36:26.491
- Where's DJ?
- I don't know.

01:36:26.493 --> 01:36:27.859
- Where's Meiying?
- I don't know!

01:36:27.861 --> 01:36:29.995
- <i>I couldn't see her anywhere.</i>
- Jonas.

01:36:29.997 --> 01:36:31.965
- <i>Sorry, I...</i>
- Go, go. Take care of Meiying.

01:36:39.739 --> 01:36:41.039
Jonas!

01:36:41.041 --> 01:36:43.510
<i>I'm okay. I'm leading
it away from the ship.</i>

01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:50.249
- Oh, my God! Gotta get...
- Stop splashing!

01:36:50.251 --> 01:36:52.450
You have a life jacket on!

01:36:52.452 --> 01:36:54.485
- A life jacket?
- Yep.

01:36:54.487 --> 01:36:56.621
Oh, yeah.
I've got a life jacket on.

01:36:56.623 --> 01:36:58.625
It's right here. I can...

01:36:59.325 --> 01:37:01.059
The monster's here.

01:37:01.061 --> 01:37:02.493
The monster's here?

01:37:02.495 --> 01:37:03.728
No, don't worry
about the monster, I got you.

01:37:03.730 --> 01:37:06.033
- Everything's fine.
- Stop talking.

01:37:10.237 --> 01:37:11.435
Meiying!

01:37:11.437 --> 01:37:13.538
Mummy! It's you!

01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:15.940
That's good! Wait! Wait!
Wait for me.

01:37:15.942 --> 01:37:18.476
Wait for DJ,
wait for DJ. Yeah.

01:37:18.478 --> 01:37:19.746
- Yes.
- Come on.

01:37:21.148 --> 01:37:23.083
Mummy, are you okay?

01:37:24.985 --> 01:37:26.484
I'm okay.

01:37:26.486 --> 01:37:28.621
I'm okay, too.

01:37:31.558 --> 01:37:32.759
Come on. Come up!

01:37:34.627 --> 01:37:37.095
- Meiying, be careful.
- Jonas!

01:37:37.097 --> 01:37:39.064
Careful! Careful!

01:37:39.066 --> 01:37:41.033
- There it is.
- Oh, my God.

01:37:41.035 --> 01:37:42.533
Jonas!

01:37:42.535 --> 01:37:43.801
It's coming.

01:37:43.803 --> 01:37:45.103
We're sitting ducks
up here, Jonas.

01:37:45.105 --> 01:37:46.804
<i>- Mummy!</i>
<i>- It's coming.</i>

01:37:46.806 --> 01:37:48.673
<i>- Can you hear me, Jonas?</i>
<i>- Meiying, hold on.</i>

01:37:48.675 --> 01:37:50.408
<i>Suyin, we're gonna
have to go. Through here.</i>

01:37:50.410 --> 01:37:52.910
Jonas, we've got nothing left.

01:37:52.912 --> 01:37:54.579
Almost nothing.

01:37:54.581 --> 01:37:56.248
How're you gonna kill it?

01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:57.448
<i>Evolution.</i>

01:37:57.450 --> 01:37:59.717
I'm gonna
make this thing bleed.

01:37:59.719 --> 01:38:01.987
<i>Suyin, what you said before,
you were right.</i>

01:38:01.989 --> 01:38:03.890
It's not about
the people you lose.

01:38:06.026 --> 01:38:08.095
<i>It's about the people
you save.</i>

01:38:09.796 --> 01:38:11.531
- Signing off.
<i>- Jonas!</i>

01:38:18.571 --> 01:38:19.739
Here we go.

01:38:26.679 --> 01:38:29.049
How do you like that? Bleed!

01:38:37.690 --> 01:38:39.093
Come on, come on, come on.

01:38:49.303 --> 01:38:50.369
Come on.

01:40:45.486 --> 01:40:46.719
Hey!

01:40:47.221 --> 01:40:48.255
Hey!

01:40:52.592 --> 01:40:53.793
Yes!

01:41:22.089 --> 01:41:23.090
Thank you.

01:41:26.959 --> 01:41:28.726
Beep-beep!
Coming through, Crazy.

01:41:28.728 --> 01:41:30.164
- Hi.
- Look who it is.

01:41:33.666 --> 01:41:34.832
Well,

01:41:34.834 --> 01:41:37.171
here's to being alive.

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:42.176
And to our friends.

01:41:48.648 --> 01:41:49.849
Cheers!

01:41:53.886 --> 01:41:55.686
I don't know about you.

01:41:55.688 --> 01:41:58.689
But, uh,
I could use a vacation.

01:41:58.691 --> 01:42:00.227
Shall we ask my mum?
