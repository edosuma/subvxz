You want something else?

01:43.020 --> 01:47.316
No, nothing wrong with Sam.
Just... wanted to take in the scenery.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.915
This is gonna be good for us, Jess,
really good.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.891
<i>Police are investigating a break-in</i>

02:20.974 --> 02:22.768
<i>and burglary at a county cemetery...</i>

02:22.851 --> 02:23.685
Gerald.

02:23.769 --> 02:25.562
- Yeah?
- Gerald!

02:26.563 --> 02:27.898
Oh, shit!

02:30.192 --> 02:31.526
<i>and reportedly disturbing several...</i>

02:31.610 --> 02:32.986
He's starving.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.821
<i>...partially exhuming at least one casket.</i>

02:42.871 --> 02:44.623
They should do something
about those strays.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.627
<i>Several city council...</i>

02:48.710 --> 02:51.213
I think he had a collar.
He might belong to someone.

02:51.296 --> 02:54.966
He won't for long. If he keeps going for
roadkill, he's gonna be roadkill himself.

02:58.678 --> 03:01.390
- We're not going back for him.
- I know.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.016
- We're not.
- I know.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.200
Not again.

03:20.492 --> 03:23.245
- Just be two minutes, babe. Okay?
- It's okay.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.204
Yeah?

03:24.913 --> 03:26.164
Yeah. No, I understand.

03:26.248 --> 03:29.835
But the only way we can move forward
is if they accept a non-compete clause.

04:19.301 --> 04:22.554
- You stocked us.
- Yeah. Enough for the whole weekend.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.108
Here, boy!

04:36.860 --> 04:40.447
You hungry?

04:43.909 --> 04:44.910
You out there?

05:26.201 --> 05:27.786
There you are.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.624
Look what I have for you.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.048
It's okay.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.470
Here you go, my poor prince.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.604
- What are you doing?
- Oh. I was just...

05:56.273 --> 05:58.984
Uh... I was just trying to feed that dog.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.903
That's Kobe rib eye.
It's actually from Kobe.

06:01.987 --> 06:04.239
It's... $200 a portion.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.826
Sorry, there were four in the fridge.
I figured...

06:08.994 --> 06:12.539
You've got such a good heart.
That's who I married.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.208
For better or worse.

06:15.292 --> 06:19.629
No, just leave it.
It'll be the best meat he's ever had.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.257
Let's go in, get comfy.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.718
Okay.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.887
I would have only eaten half a piece.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.141
He looks so hungry.

06:32.893 --> 06:36.938
- Sorry, I didn't know.
- No problem.

06:37.063 --> 06:40.025
Do you wanna open
some champagne now or should we...

06:40.108 --> 06:41.651
Um, we could...

07:38.667 --> 07:39.668
Okay.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.712
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

07:49.427 --> 07:52.889
- Wow, babe.
- You look amazing.

07:53.765 --> 07:54.766
Thanks.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.572
Sorry, babe. Gloss.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.182
Gotta say, I was... I was expecting...

08:37.183 --> 08:39.894
more novelty things,
like with velvet or silk or something.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.438
Oh, no. No, these are the real deal.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.025
The others can just break
if you get going too hard.

08:46.443 --> 08:47.527
- Okay?
- Yeah.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.532
This is good. You'll like this.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.521
Is it okay?

09:24.814 --> 09:25.815
Sure.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.779
Try to move.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.158
Okay.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.206
I love this slip.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.541
Oh, good, I bought it special.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.550
You'll like it better
around your shoulders.

10:15.532 --> 10:16.533
Ahh.

10:19.702 --> 10:20.703
Well...

10:22.205 --> 10:23.706
Look what I found.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.709
- What?
- I bet you want me to leave.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.758
I bet you think your husband
will be back any minute.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.635
But something tells me he won't.

10:47.564 --> 10:50.441
You can try to scream... if you want to.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.695
There's no one for miles.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.405
- Um... Gerald.
- Gerald?

10:56.322 --> 10:58.741
I'm sorry, baby,
you don't get to know my name.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.332
Try to call for help.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.170
- Really?
- Come on, just try.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.591
- Help. Somebody help me.
- Come on.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.385
Come on, you said you'd try
to make it feel real.

11:17.468 --> 11:20.555
Yeah, just... calling for help,
it's kinda...

11:20.638 --> 11:23.016
- What are we trying to do here?
- Just try it.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.019
I'm sorry. I'm feeling a little weird.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.730
And I thought the point was
to feel sexy, so...

11:28.813 --> 11:32.692
- Well, you'll settle into it.
- Okay.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.617
Help! Somebody help!

11:41.159 --> 11:42.994
Ow!

11:43.077 --> 11:45.038
- Sorry, I'm just...
- That really hurt.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.376
- You like it, though. Don't you?
- Gerald. Gerald.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.004
I don't like this.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.715
- I'm serious. Stop.
- Yeah, like that. Make it feel real.

11:56.883 --> 11:57.800
Stop it.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.052
- Make me.
- Stop!

11:59.761 --> 12:02.347
You can fight all you want,
but Daddy's gonna get what Daddy wants.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.431
Fucking stop it!

12:04.641 --> 12:06.684
Uncuff me now!

12:08.978 --> 12:11.272
Are you... are you playing?

12:11.356 --> 12:13.191
Wipe that absurd grin off your face.

12:13.733 --> 12:17.487
Uncuff me
and stop calling yourself fucking "Daddy"!

12:17.570 --> 12:18.571
Jesus.

12:20.323 --> 12:22.158
Isn't this why we came up here?

12:24.369 --> 12:27.538
To spice things up
and try and push some boundaries?

12:29.666 --> 12:31.834
- I said I'd try a few things.
- Yeah.

12:32.377 --> 12:36.047
- You said you'd try.
- And I tried, and it's not working.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.845
Is this... Is this really
what it takes these days?

12:43.721 --> 12:45.473
Well, fuck, Jess, I...

12:46.474 --> 12:47.308
Sorry...

12:48.518 --> 12:50.770
if I wanna try
and make things more exciting.

12:53.856 --> 12:57.235
You haven't touched me... in months.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.154
No interest whatsoever,

13:00.238 --> 13:02.615
until I say I'll let you play
some sex game,

13:02.699 --> 13:06.327
and it's turning into a rape fantasy
that I never knew you had.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.540
Please, just unlock these.

13:11.499 --> 13:15.003
This isn't gonna save us, Ger.
It never was.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.425
I just... I feel ridiculous.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.511
Nice.

13:23.845 --> 13:25.138
- Now I'm ridiculous.
- No.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.640
Babe, I feel ridiculous.
That's all I'm saying.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.892
Jesus, I can't do
a fucking thing right, can I?

13:29.976 --> 13:31.936
- That's not true.
- You can't blame me...

13:32.645 --> 13:35.815
if I don't get excited anymore,
and you won't even try.

13:37.066 --> 13:40.278
Okay. Just uncuff me and we can talk.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.573
What if I won't?

13:45.575 --> 13:46.576
What do you mean?

13:50.913 --> 13:52.498
What if I won't?

13:54.333 --> 13:56.044
Wait. You have to.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.883
What if I'm sweet?

14:05.595 --> 14:08.139
Go to the bathroom,
get the keys off the sink.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.849
I'll just be sweet.

14:10.391 --> 14:11.517
- Gerald...
- Shh.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.686
- I need you to stop this.
- You'll like it.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.897
Fuck!

14:19.442 --> 14:21.194
What the fuck is the matter with you?

14:22.362 --> 14:23.613
With me?

14:32.914 --> 14:34.916
How did we go so wrong?

14:37.210 --> 14:38.044
Mnh-mnh.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.840
Jess, we were happy once.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.717
Of course.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.221
- Weren't we?
- Yes.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.723
- I mean, weren't we?
- Yes.

14:55.645 --> 14:56.479
What?

14:57.772 --> 14:58.773
Gerald?

14:59.982 --> 15:01.943
- Oh, my God.
- Honey.

15:03.361 --> 15:04.362
Hey, that's not funny.

15:07.573 --> 15:08.491
Gerald?

15:08.574 --> 15:09.617
Gerald?

15:10.410 --> 15:12.328
What's... Gerald?

15:13.413 --> 15:16.290
Hey, hey! What's happ...

15:21.212 --> 15:22.380
Oh, my God.

15:28.469 --> 15:29.429
Honey?

15:34.809 --> 15:35.810
Come on.

15:41.399 --> 15:42.442
I can't...

15:42.525 --> 15:44.777
Gerald! Gerald!

15:44.861 --> 15:46.279
Hey, baby, look at me.

15:46.863 --> 15:47.864
Wake up, Gerald.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.532
Gerald?

15:59.041 --> 15:59.876
Ger?

16:00.626 --> 16:02.378
Where... Gerald.

16:03.671 --> 16:06.174
Gerald, say something!

16:07.842 --> 16:08.968
Please!

16:39.999 --> 16:41.042
Oh, God!

16:46.672 --> 16:47.673
Wake up!

16:49.550 --> 16:50.551
Wake up!

16:56.766 --> 16:59.310
Help!

17:06.526 --> 17:08.402
Sound more real now, huh?

17:09.945 --> 17:11.321
You wanna try again?

17:12.740 --> 17:16.618
Just get back up here.
You can do anything you want.

17:17.703 --> 17:18.704
I mean it.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.165
Anything.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.182
Help!

17:38.766 --> 17:42.270
Help! Somebody!

17:42.937 --> 17:45.523
Help! Somebody!

17:58.953 --> 18:00.788
Help.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.506
Help.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.307
Wake up.

18:20.308 --> 18:21.309
Just wake up.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.770
It's time to wake up, honey.

18:26.314 --> 18:27.398
It's time to wake up.

18:37.742 --> 18:38.576
Hello?

19:00.097 --> 19:01.349
Help.

19:10.941 --> 19:12.276
It'll be dark.

19:15.446 --> 19:18.949
In an hour or so, it'll be so dark.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.417
Hey!

19:29.877 --> 19:32.254
We're back here! He's hurt!

19:34.507 --> 19:36.592
Nate, Kelly, is that you?

20:00.908 --> 20:02.702
Shit.

20:05.871 --> 20:06.747
Hi.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.461
How was the steak?

20:13.671 --> 20:15.673
It's $200 a portion, you know.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.098
I don't suppose you're a rescue dog.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.560
I didn't think so.

20:41.866 --> 20:42.867
Hey.

20:43.409 --> 20:44.493
Hey.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.121
Back off from him.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.708
Hey!

20:58.799 --> 21:00.259
Hey!

21:00.968 --> 21:01.969
Hey!

21:02.803 --> 21:04.096
Get away from him.

21:06.182 --> 21:07.016
Back off!

21:09.560 --> 21:10.603
Bad dog!

21:12.188 --> 21:13.397
Bad dog!

21:15.941 --> 21:17.151
Hmm...

21:17.359 --> 21:18.360
Hey!

21:19.028 --> 21:20.070
Bad dog! Go away!

21:22.031 --> 21:24.867
Oh, God!

21:25.201 --> 21:29.955
Oh. Uhh...

21:37.880 --> 21:39.006
Get the fuck away!

21:39.590 --> 21:41.008
Get the fuck away from him!

21:47.765 --> 21:48.766
No.

21:53.354 --> 21:54.855
No.

21:58.025 --> 22:00.152
- Gerald?
- What the hell?

22:00.236 --> 22:02.822
Oh, my God. Thank God.
I thought... I thought you...

22:03.405 --> 22:04.573
My goddamn arm!

22:04.657 --> 22:08.536
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- The dog, right?

22:08.619 --> 22:11.497
- You were so right. I was so wrong.
- The one you fed.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.959
Uncuff me and hold me. I'm so sorry, baby!

22:15.042 --> 22:16.585
The goddamn dog.

22:19.463 --> 22:20.714
That goddamn dog.

22:23.968 --> 22:25.553
The goddamn dog you had to feed.

22:27.388 --> 22:29.306
Smelled the blood, did what dogs do.

22:29.390 --> 22:31.308
Fuck you, roadkill! I hope you choke!

22:33.435 --> 22:36.188
Should've let you cut up all the steak.
Maybe it would've filled him up.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.733
But I guess they always smell
fresher meat.

22:39.817 --> 22:42.236
Do you remember the joke I told
at Christmas last year?

22:42.695 --> 22:43.779
You came up behind me.

22:43.862 --> 22:46.282
I was, like, four or five
into the night already.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.200
I was loose but not slurring yet.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.869
It was Tom Reynolds I was talking to...

22:51.453 --> 22:57.418
in this low and conspiratorial, in that
very specific "guys only" fucking tone

22:57.501 --> 23:00.588
that says, "You'll appreciate this,
brother, but only you."

23:02.214 --> 23:04.592
You didn't hear the beginning
of the joke, just the end...

23:05.551 --> 23:09.930
"And what is a woman anyway?"

23:10.848 --> 23:12.266
And I waited.

23:13.142 --> 23:16.061
That cocky little pause I take
before a punch line

23:16.145 --> 23:17.855
that really makes me proud of myself,

23:17.938 --> 23:20.441
and Tom said, "What?"
like he already knew the answer,

23:20.524 --> 23:21.525
and I said...

23:26.488 --> 23:28.907
"A life support..."

23:28.991 --> 23:32.494
Come on. "And what is a woman, anyway?"

23:36.832 --> 23:39.627
- "A life support system for a cunt."
- Yeah, that was it.

23:40.419 --> 23:44.089
You never told me you heard it.
You never raised an objection.

23:44.173 --> 23:47.051
You smiled through the night,
hated me a little bit,

23:47.134 --> 23:50.262
- but never once brought it up.
- Because you're not like that.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.516
- You don't talk that way.
- Yeah, was I just putting on a show?

23:55.935 --> 23:56.977
For a client?

23:58.520 --> 24:01.690
Stooping to his level
to get something I needed,

24:01.774 --> 24:06.195
or was that who I really was,
underneath it all?

24:09.948 --> 24:13.369
Don't ask a question you don't wanna know
the answer to, I guess.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.828
I guess.

24:16.288 --> 24:20.793
A life support system
for a stupid fucking cunt is more like it.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.586
How many hours you been chained
to that bed?

24:22.670 --> 24:25.881
You never heard me breathe, not once.
And you know the sound.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.926
You've heard it every night
for the last 11 years.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.512
That tiny rumbling snore I make
in the back of my throat

24:31.595 --> 24:34.848
that sometimes. I make when I'm lost
in thought. I forget myself. I zone out.

24:34.932 --> 24:37.810
That tiny little "Gerald only"
fucking purr.

24:37.893 --> 24:43.232
Hours of not hearing that sound,
total fucking silence, and you knew it.

24:43.315 --> 24:46.485
Five minutes after my head hit the floor,
you saw blood. You heard the silence,

24:46.568 --> 24:50.072
and you knew it, but you just laid there,
wasting precious minutes and hours

24:50.155 --> 24:53.659
and breath and life, calling my fucking
name, talking to a corpse on the floor.

24:53.742 --> 24:54.743
What's happening?

24:55.828 --> 24:57.746
Well, I'm pretty sure
you just lost your mind.

24:59.123 --> 25:00.999
Seeing a dog eating your husband
will do that.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.377
If you're gonna have a mental breakdown,
that's a great excuse.

25:03.460 --> 25:04.336
Right.

25:06.547 --> 25:07.923
The blood stopped spreading.

25:09.133 --> 25:10.259
A while ago.

25:10.342 --> 25:14.638
And you did what you always do
when it gets too much, you ran.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.223
In here.

25:17.516 --> 25:21.061
You just laid here,
calling my name again and again,

25:21.145 --> 25:23.981
and let critical time tick by

25:24.064 --> 25:26.233
- like a stupid fucking...
- Stop it.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.026
You should have been thinking
about life support.

25:28.110 --> 25:30.112
Maybe that's why
you're remembering that joke now.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.572
Gotta be for some reason, after all.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.658
And why is that?

25:35.951 --> 25:37.369
- Time.
- That's right!

25:39.121 --> 25:41.665
You're a life support system.
You've been unplugged.

25:41.749 --> 25:44.126
There's still juice in there,
but the charge is running down.

25:44.209 --> 25:47.421
And if you don't get out of the cuffs,
it will go all the way to zero.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.176
When did we get here?

25:58.223 --> 25:59.767
One-ish, I think.

25:59.850 --> 26:01.435
And how long till we got into bed?

26:03.061 --> 26:05.564
- An hour, maybe more.
- Call that two o'clock, then.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.065
And I dropped dead...

26:07.858 --> 26:09.151
Ten minutes, maybe, after.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.111
When's the sun been setting?

26:11.862 --> 26:14.740
- 7:15 or so.
- Oh, that's pretty close.

26:14.823 --> 26:20.913
That's another 15, 20, tops.
So, let's say... five hours, so far.

26:21.663 --> 26:23.207
Five hours you've wasted,

26:23.290 --> 26:25.751
screaming for neighbors
that are half a mile away.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.586
If they're even here yet.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.880
And, you know,
if you really think about it...

26:29.963 --> 26:32.966
- Nate and Kelly said they wouldn't...
- They wouldn't be heading up until June.

26:33.050 --> 26:34.843
The maids came to prep for us yesterday.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.970
Because the bed is made
and the house is dusted.

26:37.054 --> 26:39.056
Which means they're done and gone,
and the grass...

26:39.139 --> 26:42.267
- ...was cut, fresh.
- Which means no gardeners.

26:43.143 --> 26:47.439
Because I arranged it all
to get the place ready for us today.

26:50.067 --> 26:52.444
And I wouldn't want them
interrupting my little game,

26:52.528 --> 26:55.489
so I probably gave them
at least the weekend off.

26:56.073 --> 26:58.325
- So, who could possibly...
- ...possibly hear you scream?

26:58.408 --> 26:59.952
Except Cujo over there?

27:16.009 --> 27:18.220
- You tried that.
- I know.

27:19.930 --> 27:23.433
You can pull till your wrists break.
You're not getting out of those cuffs.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.779
I told you.

27:36.238 --> 27:37.322
I told you.

27:54.923 --> 27:56.008
It's that easy.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.554
Oh, babe, you're really losing it now.

28:02.139 --> 28:04.224
Except your hand won't fit
through the cuff

28:04.308 --> 28:05.642
and the bedpost is reinforced.

28:05.726 --> 28:07.394
- Nice thought, though.
- Shut up.

28:08.312 --> 28:12.024
Don't listen to him. He's the reason
we're here and look how he ended up.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.859
I'm just telling her
how things really are.

28:13.942 --> 28:17.613
No, you're doing what you always did,
minimizing, condescending.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.240
Men aren't so much blessed
with penises as cursed by them.

28:21.241 --> 28:24.077
And we might die here today
because of Gerald's five inches.

28:24.995 --> 28:28.165
Our life has to add up to more than that.

28:28.874 --> 28:31.376
- I can't get out.
- What about the stories on the news,

28:31.460 --> 28:33.629
where mothers lift their cars
to save their children?

28:33.712 --> 28:34.880
She's no mother.

28:36.256 --> 28:37.841
What's that supposed to mean?

28:38.967 --> 28:40.594
No maternal instinct.

28:41.178 --> 28:44.306
- Your career always came first.
- That's what you said.

28:44.806 --> 28:46.642
Maybe you even started to believe it.

28:47.935 --> 28:50.229
I'm not so sure you can hide things
from me now.

28:50.312 --> 28:51.730
You're wasting precious time here.

28:51.813 --> 28:53.106
I can't get out.

28:53.190 --> 28:56.276
- You have to.
- I am chained to the goddamn bed!

28:56.735 --> 28:59.029
Don't recite facts to me. Wake up.

28:59.112 --> 29:00.948
Says the voice in your head.

29:01.865 --> 29:04.117
This is you... all over.

29:04.618 --> 29:06.828
Problem, panic, denial.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.998
Hoping if you look away,
it'll magically vanish.

29:11.083 --> 29:14.878
If you don't wake up,
you're gonna die in those handcuffs.

29:15.545 --> 29:18.674
And we both know you've been sleepwalking
since you were 12 years old.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.300
- Not now.
- If not now, when?

29:20.384 --> 29:21.802
Not now, what?

29:23.595 --> 29:26.974
He put you in those handcuffs
way before Gerald did.

29:31.645 --> 29:32.646
Who's "he"?

30:03.593 --> 30:05.429
If I can get to the phone...

30:14.438 --> 30:16.732
Phone's gonna die anyway.
I never charged it.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.026
Or did a load of laundry, for that matter.

30:30.203 --> 30:31.204
Tough luck.

30:31.788 --> 30:34.875
Okay, scrap that.
Phone might as well be on Mars.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.294
If you can't get off the bed...

30:38.587 --> 30:40.422
live long enough
for someone to find you on it.

30:44.634 --> 30:45.469
Yeah.

31:03.153 --> 31:04.279
What's wrong?

31:06.073 --> 31:07.282
My head hurts.

31:10.410 --> 31:11.578
You know why?

31:12.954 --> 31:14.206
Life support.

31:18.168 --> 31:20.295
How long do you think
someone lives without water?

31:22.005 --> 31:23.006
Three days?

31:24.800 --> 31:25.801
At best.

31:29.262 --> 31:31.640
Yeah, seems like
I've heard three days somewhere.

31:33.392 --> 31:34.518
That feels about right.

31:37.354 --> 31:39.356
And it's been, what? Five...

31:40.440 --> 31:42.442
six, seven hours.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.740
I wanted to please you so badly.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.663
This was such a stupid fucking idea.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.375
Remember when I first
started taking those?

31:59.668 --> 32:00.669
I hid it.

32:01.878 --> 32:03.839
For what, six months?

32:04.423 --> 32:05.924
I found the prescription.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.636
You found it and never said anything.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.434
But I knew you'd seen it,
and I just stopped covering it up.

32:16.935 --> 32:20.439
- We never talked about it, though.
- There was that one time.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.068
That one time.

32:25.944 --> 32:30.407
Late one night, you tried without a pill,
and it just wasn't working.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.492
- I was as soft as a kitten.
- Until...

32:32.576 --> 32:35.662
- Until...
- Until you held my wrists above my head.

32:37.122 --> 32:39.791
- I hadn't done that before.
- No, you had.

32:41.334 --> 32:44.463
- This time, though...
- I grabbed your throat.

32:46.506 --> 32:49.759
- Softly, then I squeezed, didn't I?
- Mm-hmm.

32:51.553 --> 32:52.929
And, God, was I hard.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.725
I was harder than you'd felt in years.

32:57.726 --> 32:59.478
And you just laid there...

33:00.979 --> 33:02.522
and I went to town...

33:04.900 --> 33:06.443
and you moaned...

33:07.777 --> 33:10.071
like a dutiful wife, never objected.

33:13.533 --> 33:16.661
But, for the first time, first time
in all those years, you wondered...

33:18.538 --> 33:20.540
"Who exactly did I marry?"

33:22.417 --> 33:24.711
We never really know, do we?

33:27.005 --> 33:29.466
'Cause everybody's got a little corner
in there somewhere.

33:31.384 --> 33:35.222
A button...
they won't admit they want pressed.

33:38.308 --> 33:39.518
Year after year...

33:41.561 --> 33:43.939
I barely gave you a glimpse of mine.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.235
One thing for sure...

33:50.487 --> 33:52.614
you're glad he took
those little blue pills.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.200
Huh?

33:55.909 --> 33:56.993
You're glad.

33:58.411 --> 33:59.663
I couldn't figure out...

34:00.622 --> 34:02.582
what was wrong with me that you needed.

34:02.666 --> 34:05.418
No, you're not listening. Take one, babe.

34:14.803 --> 34:15.887
Now give it to her.

34:17.931 --> 34:18.931
Wait, I...

34:19.014 --> 34:20.516
Give it to her.

34:20.891 --> 34:24.187
- Are you...
- Give her what she needs.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.150
Nice.

34:29.818 --> 34:32.112
Thank God for those pills.

34:32.821 --> 34:37.993
For those little blue pills
that made Gerald so thirsty.

34:39.536 --> 34:40.370
Oh...

34:55.677 --> 34:56.553
Okay. Okay.

35:47.854 --> 35:48.938
You're smirking.

35:50.899 --> 35:51.733
What?

35:54.611 --> 35:55.820
That's what.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.743
- Stupid.
- No.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.706
Don't you dare let it go.

36:06.790 --> 36:09.459
- But I can't.
- Put it down.

36:09.542 --> 36:11.836
- Where?
- Right where you caught it.

36:12.796 --> 36:15.090
- Where you know you can reach it again.
- Okay.

36:20.053 --> 36:21.012
Careful.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.439
Go away.

36:34.776 --> 36:37.362
- Get the fuck away!
- Look at me.

36:39.114 --> 36:43.993
That dog is just doing what it has to,
to get along, and you have to do the same.

36:45.245 --> 36:47.372
- Focus.
- But I can't!

36:48.498 --> 36:50.417
You're right. Give up.

36:51.251 --> 36:53.628
Come tomorrow,
you and Gerald will be together again,

36:54.003 --> 36:55.255
inside the fucking dog.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.133
- Can we please get back to work now?
- Mm-hmm.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.217
I love this slip.

37:02.595 --> 37:05.056
I love this slip.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.852
Oh, good, I bought it special.

37:09.269 --> 37:10.603
You bought it brand-new.

38:34.395 --> 38:35.230
Mmm.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.071
Leave some for later.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.579
Why can't I keep my eyes open?

39:33.371 --> 39:36.040
Stress makes your adrenaline
and cortisol levels skyrocket,

39:36.124 --> 39:37.625
and now you're crashing.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.919
That's it, just fade away.

39:41.087 --> 39:42.714
Assume this'll all be fine.

39:44.591 --> 39:48.636
- I know... I know I shouldn't.
- Well, maybe you should.

39:50.263 --> 39:53.224
If anyone's gonna find you,
it'll likely be tomorrow, not tonight.

39:55.226 --> 39:58.104
- I will need my energy.
- You will.

39:58.771 --> 39:59.939
You will, at that.

40:02.942 --> 40:05.194
Hmm. Tomorrow.

41:35.201 --> 41:37.829
Where'd you go, you little shit?

41:58.182 --> 41:59.183
Hello?

42:28.713 --> 42:29.714
Who are you?

42:34.510 --> 42:36.929
I... I need help.

42:51.444 --> 42:52.320
You're...

42:54.072 --> 42:54.947
not...

42:55.948 --> 42:56.949
real.

42:58.201 --> 42:59.285
Not real.

43:16.052 --> 43:17.053
Not real.

43:18.387 --> 43:19.222
Maybe.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.894
Or maybe you're just not safe anymore.

43:28.856 --> 43:31.943
People are safe from ghouls and ghosts...

43:32.860 --> 43:35.404
and the living dead in the daylight.

43:37.490 --> 43:39.534
And they're usually safe
from them at night...

43:40.368 --> 43:41.619
if they're with others.

43:42.995 --> 43:46.207
But a person alone... in the dark...

43:48.960 --> 43:54.882
Women alone in the dark
are like open doors, Jessie.

43:54.966 --> 43:57.844
And if they scream for help,
who knows what might answer?

44:01.389 --> 44:05.768
Who knows what people see
in the moment of their solitary death?

44:08.771 --> 44:12.066
Is it so hard to believe
that some of them may have died of fear...

44:14.110 --> 44:17.446
no matter what the words
on the death certificates say?

44:22.076 --> 44:23.369
Died of fear...

44:25.288 --> 44:27.456
because they saw, at their bedside...

44:30.501 --> 44:31.836
the Moonlight Man.

44:35.256 --> 44:37.633
Maybe that's just what Death looks like.

44:39.343 --> 44:41.846
Not... real.

44:46.058 --> 44:47.685
Then why did the dog leave?

44:54.483 --> 44:56.652
Maybe he just moved...

44:57.820 --> 44:58.821
under the bed.

45:02.325 --> 45:05.119
He could reach up at any time,
put his hand on your hip.

45:15.546 --> 45:19.967
And if he wants that cold, dirty hand...

45:20.927 --> 45:22.845
on your soft, warm flesh,

45:22.929 --> 45:26.182
there's not much
you can do about it, Mouse.

45:28.142 --> 45:30.937
- What did you call me?
- Close your eyes.

45:31.520 --> 45:34.565
If there's a monster under your bed,
it won't bother you if you're asleep.

45:36.734 --> 45:38.986
Everybody knows that, Mouse.

45:40.821 --> 45:42.365
Don't call me that.

45:43.950 --> 45:45.743
Dream your dreams.

45:47.954 --> 45:48.996
Dream deep.

46:01.258 --> 46:02.718
<i>No, help your father, please.</i>

46:03.803 --> 46:05.221
You okay, Jessie?

46:05.304 --> 46:08.140
- It's so much smaller than I remember.
- 'Cause you're bigger.

46:08.849 --> 46:10.393
- Come on, Mouse.
- Wait up.

46:10.476 --> 46:11.769
I'm going in the water!

46:11.852 --> 46:14.230
- No, no, no.
- No, no running, please.

46:14.313 --> 46:15.314
Thank you.

46:18.901 --> 46:21.612
Can you please bring
your lacrosse stuff inside?

46:21.696 --> 46:25.157
- Can you help, please?
- No playing that inside.

46:25.241 --> 46:27.410
<i>For the first time in 26 years,</i>

46:27.493 --> 46:30.871
<i>a total solar eclipse will occur
in the United States.</i>

46:30.955 --> 46:33.040
<i>The few and lucky cities
along the path of the eclipse</i>

46:33.124 --> 46:35.668
<i>who have decided
to create official viewing areas,</i>

46:35.751 --> 46:37.753
<i>have set their focus to logistics,</i>

46:37.837 --> 46:40.381
<i>ensuring the comfort and safety
of their guests.</i>

46:40.881 --> 46:43.592
<i>For those of us who have never seen
a total solar eclipse,</i>

46:43.676 --> 46:45.845
<i>this is an opportunity
to view one of the most rare...</i>

46:45.928 --> 46:48.931
- <i>and beautiful phenomena on the planet.</i>
- Dad!

46:49.015 --> 46:50.224
<i>The eclipse is tracked...</i>

46:50.307 --> 46:52.685
- Oh, you did it!
- We finally finished them.

46:52.768 --> 46:54.020
I made this, too.

46:54.103 --> 46:57.440
All right.
Here, go on out to the boat now.

46:57.523 --> 46:59.025
- Yes, sir.
- Be careful.

46:59.108 --> 47:01.235
- Okay.
- Okay, Dad.

47:01.318 --> 47:04.155
<i>It's rare to see
more than one from any single location.</i>

47:04.238 --> 47:09.201
<i>You'd have to wait an average of 375 years
to see two eclipses from the same place.</i>

47:09.744 --> 47:12.246
<i>Since our area lies
within the path of totality,</i>

47:12.329 --> 47:16.208
<i>we can expect to experience
two minutes and 20 seconds of totality,</i>

47:16.292 --> 47:18.753
<i>starting today at around 4:17 p.m.</i>

47:18.836 --> 47:20.546
You want me to make sandwiches
for the boat?

47:21.130 --> 47:24.925
I don't think I wanna go out
on the boat today. The lake scares me.

47:25.009 --> 47:26.802
People have drowned out there, you know.

47:27.970 --> 47:31.515
If she's afraid of the water,
I'm not gonna force her out onto a boat.

47:31.599 --> 47:34.518
We came here as a family
to do this on the lake.

47:34.810 --> 47:37.855
It is not going to kill her
to spend some time with the rest of us.

47:37.938 --> 47:39.899
She's a complete daddy's girl.

47:39.982 --> 47:41.734
- That's normal, isn't it?
- Please don't.

47:41.817 --> 47:42.818
What?

47:44.403 --> 47:47.698
You didn't even wanna go skiing with us
over Christmas.

47:47.782 --> 47:50.034
And we didn't force you out
onto the mountain, did we?

47:50.117 --> 47:52.244
No, we left you at the lodge
and let you relax.

47:52.328 --> 47:53.621
You wanna stay with her?

47:53.704 --> 47:56.957
Stay with her. Fine.
She's a nuisance anyway.

47:57.041 --> 47:59.376
She picks fights with her brother.
She rolls her eyes at me incessantly.

47:59.460 --> 48:02.380
- She's 12.
- Yeah. Smiles and sweetness for Daddy.

48:03.839 --> 48:06.384
That's totally
age-appropriate behavior, isn't it?

48:08.594 --> 48:09.595
Sure.

48:10.930 --> 48:11.931
It's just...

48:15.017 --> 48:17.645
It's fine. It's fine! It's fine.

48:17.728 --> 48:19.146
Okay, I'm not...

48:25.361 --> 48:27.822
<i>...than at any other point along its path.</i>

48:27.905 --> 48:29.782
<i>This is another reminder to our listeners</i>

48:29.865 --> 48:33.244
<i>not to look directly into the eclipse,
which should begin to...</i>

48:41.961 --> 48:42.962
That's better.

48:44.088 --> 48:46.549
Unless you don't wanna listen
to Daddy's old man music.

48:46.632 --> 48:47.675
No, I like it.

48:52.888 --> 48:54.181
That's a beautiful dress.

48:55.141 --> 48:58.894
- Is that your new one?
- Yeah. Mom said it was too short.

49:00.604 --> 49:01.605
Mom's wrong.

49:02.398 --> 49:03.440
You look amazing.

49:04.692 --> 49:06.444
You look like a proper young woman.

49:06.902 --> 49:11.157
- Here, so you don't hurt your eyes.
- Thanks. Where's yours?

49:13.200 --> 49:15.035
Oh, you know what? I don't know.

49:17.246 --> 49:19.039
I think your mom might have taken it.

49:20.583 --> 49:22.835
- Scoot close and we'll share.
- Okay.

49:34.180 --> 49:35.181
It's starting.

49:40.603 --> 49:41.478
Wow.

49:48.068 --> 49:49.069
What?

49:50.112 --> 49:51.113
Nothing.

49:51.906 --> 49:53.491
I'm just remembering something.

49:55.117 --> 49:56.952
You and me, sitting here together...

49:59.413 --> 50:02.208
When you were a little girl,
you used to sit on my lap.

50:02.291 --> 50:03.584
You'd point up at the stars,

50:03.667 --> 50:06.378
and you'd ask me
how far away each one was.

50:06.712 --> 50:09.089
That's embarrassing.

50:09.924 --> 50:10.925
No.

50:11.800 --> 50:12.927
It's the sweetest.

50:16.472 --> 50:19.558
Some great evenings out here, you and me.

50:20.684 --> 50:21.810
Me and Mouse.

50:26.982 --> 50:28.567
Nah, that's stupid.

50:29.735 --> 50:30.736
What?

50:32.154 --> 50:33.572
I was gonna say...

50:37.326 --> 50:38.327
What?

50:41.038 --> 50:42.039
Well, how about it?

50:43.874 --> 50:45.042
For old time's sake?

50:47.795 --> 50:51.340
Nah, that's silly. That's just
a silly idea from your silly old man.

50:52.091 --> 50:53.092
I was just...

50:53.801 --> 50:56.553
thinking about how happy
those times were, that's all.

50:58.222 --> 51:00.724
Hell, I know you're a grown woman now.

51:00.808 --> 51:03.227
You're too big to sit
on your daddy's lap anymore.

51:06.855 --> 51:08.732
I just miss my little girl sometimes.

51:20.286 --> 51:21.412
I'm not too big.

51:23.414 --> 51:24.456
You sure?

51:24.999 --> 51:26.083
Yeppers.

51:33.007 --> 51:33.882
Mouse...

51:35.217 --> 51:37.511
- I love you.
- I love you too, Daddy.

51:56.238 --> 52:02.703
- Awesome. It's just amazing.
- <i>♪ If you ever change your mind... ♪</i>

52:04.330 --> 52:05.748
Daddy, you're missing it.

52:07.291 --> 52:09.293
Just... you keep watching.

52:09.376 --> 52:12.838
<i>♪ Baby, bring it to me ♪</i>

52:12.921 --> 52:15.799
<i>♪ Bring your sweet loving ♪</i>

52:15.883 --> 52:18.302
- <i>♪ Bring it on home to me ♪</i>
- Daddy?

52:18.385 --> 52:19.678
Just keep watching.

52:19.762 --> 52:24.266
<i>- ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪
- ♪ Yeah, yeah... ♪</i>

52:24.350 --> 52:28.812
- Daddy...
- Just keep... watching.

52:46.872 --> 52:49.833
Oh, Jesus. Jesus!

52:49.917 --> 52:53.379
You've been hanging on them all night.
They need circulation.

52:56.673 --> 52:57.758
It burns!

53:05.057 --> 53:06.225
Cramps. They'll...

53:10.687 --> 53:11.688
...pass.

53:12.314 --> 53:13.982
The cramps will pass.

53:14.942 --> 53:17.194
Keep pedaling. Get the blood flowing.

53:32.918 --> 53:33.961
Oh, God...

53:36.296 --> 53:37.548
Oh, God, that hurts.

54:04.700 --> 54:06.326
Bad dreams.

54:08.996 --> 54:10.038
You never told me...

54:11.790 --> 54:12.791
about the eclipse.

54:14.751 --> 54:15.961
I never told anyone.

54:17.045 --> 54:18.756
That's a marriage, isn't it?

54:19.506 --> 54:23.260
- Telling each other the difficult things?
- Not that one, no.

54:27.473 --> 54:29.308
No wonder it didn't work.

54:30.309 --> 54:31.935
It wasn't relevant to us.

54:33.270 --> 54:34.104
Really?

54:36.148 --> 54:37.357
You married an older man.

54:37.441 --> 54:39.943
Your father was a lawyer.
Gerald was a lawyer.

54:40.527 --> 54:43.864
Your father minimized you,
objectified you.

54:43.947 --> 54:45.657
Let's not forget
my burgeoning drinking problem.

54:46.241 --> 54:48.827
Babe, if you had a drinking problem,
that's certainly cured now.

54:50.454 --> 54:51.455
The point is, Jessie...

54:52.414 --> 54:54.708
you married into the only dynamic
you've ever known.

54:55.417 --> 54:57.461
You were a girl, he was a man, and...

54:58.378 --> 55:00.005
you never walked away from that.

55:00.088 --> 55:01.590
That afternoon never ended.

55:01.965 --> 55:05.010
It's not enough... that I'm here.

55:05.093 --> 55:08.180
I also have to be there? Again?

55:08.263 --> 55:09.348
You tell me.

55:09.848 --> 55:12.976
You'd gotten your period
for the first time a month before, right?

55:14.728 --> 55:18.941
Maybe that's what got him going.
He smelled the blood and did what dogs do.

55:22.027 --> 55:25.531
Our friend in the hall
is every man you've ever known.

55:26.240 --> 55:27.741
He had Kobe rib eye...

55:27.824 --> 55:30.160
- It's actually from Kobe.
- ...till he smelled Gerald.

55:30.619 --> 55:32.913
Your father had your mother
till you were nice and ripe.

55:32.996 --> 55:34.957
- It wasn't like that.
- And Gerald...

55:35.040 --> 55:37.626
The late hours, the mystery callers...

55:38.210 --> 55:40.671
The weekend trips...
What was he really doing?

55:41.463 --> 55:42.673
You ignored it, but...

55:43.757 --> 55:46.635
you knew his hunger for you had faded,
and a dog's gotta eat.

55:47.761 --> 55:49.012
I handled it.

55:50.222 --> 55:51.223
Sure.

55:52.599 --> 55:55.769
Just like you handled
those last few minutes on Daddy's lap.

55:59.815 --> 56:01.483
He didn't rape me.

56:02.442 --> 56:04.027
He didn't even touch me.

56:05.237 --> 56:07.531
He only touched himself.

56:08.615 --> 56:10.742
And if you wanna blame someone...

56:11.743 --> 56:13.036
I might as well blame...

56:13.829 --> 56:16.373
my mother or the boat.

56:17.040 --> 56:19.293
The sundress that was too short.

56:22.129 --> 56:25.299
What he did to me on that swing...

56:26.633 --> 56:28.969
wasn't the worst thing anyone's ever done.

56:30.345 --> 56:34.641
No, that would be what he did
to you after, in the bedroom.

56:37.603 --> 56:38.604
What did he do?

56:43.275 --> 56:44.276
Nothing.

56:45.694 --> 56:48.030
He just talked to me.

56:48.113 --> 56:49.156
Nothing?

56:51.742 --> 56:52.909
Nothing on the swing.

56:55.454 --> 56:58.874
And nothing in the room.
It might as well have been a bad dream.

56:59.750 --> 57:00.917
I had a dream...

57:02.294 --> 57:03.712
that night at the lake house.

57:06.381 --> 57:07.507
There was a woman...

57:08.175 --> 57:12.971
standing over a deep well,
looking down into the blackness.

57:14.056 --> 57:16.016
And I'm in the well, looking up at her.

57:16.975 --> 57:20.771
The sky was so dark behind her...

57:21.980 --> 57:23.982
the eclipse burning overhead.

57:25.359 --> 57:27.444
The smell... The smell in that well...

57:30.072 --> 57:33.158
It was like pennies, and then oysters.

57:35.327 --> 57:37.371
She was standing there in her red dress...

57:38.747 --> 57:39.957
looking right at me.

57:42.167 --> 57:43.460
What was in the well?

57:46.505 --> 57:48.006
Secrets.

57:51.259 --> 57:53.387
So many secrets.

57:54.388 --> 57:56.181
You thought yours
could go down there, too.

57:57.015 --> 58:00.644
Just... throw 'em in the well,
down in the dark.

58:03.230 --> 58:04.231
Who was the woman?

58:05.107 --> 58:07.526
I remember thinking
maybe she was supposed to be me.

58:08.819 --> 58:12.406
Because she would never tell.
I knew that, looking at her.

58:13.240 --> 58:15.242
She'd die before she told.

58:16.284 --> 58:17.869
"I could do that," I figured.

58:22.749 --> 58:24.584
I don't know why I thought of that.

58:26.169 --> 58:27.587
It was just a dream.

58:29.172 --> 58:30.590
Like the man in the corner.

58:33.343 --> 58:36.972
He was definitely... a bad dream.

58:39.558 --> 58:40.892
I don't know, princess.

58:46.023 --> 58:47.774
You can tell yourself that
if you need to.

58:47.858 --> 58:49.568
He was a trick of the mind.

58:49.651 --> 58:52.404
Just like you, Gerald.
Just like both of you.

58:52.487 --> 58:54.698
Then why won't you look over there
for more than a second?

58:54.781 --> 58:56.033
What are you afraid you're gonna see?

58:57.659 --> 58:59.411
- Why are you still listening to him?
- Shh!

59:10.464 --> 59:13.800
- It's probably from the dog.
- It's bigger than that.

59:15.969 --> 59:17.262
Look at it again.

59:24.311 --> 59:25.687
I think it's a footprint.

59:26.229 --> 59:27.856
- And if it is...
- Shut up!

59:27.939 --> 59:29.858
...it was Death you saw.

59:31.943 --> 59:33.612
He'll be back tonight, Jessie.

59:35.781 --> 59:38.658
And when you're dead, he'll have
your wedding ring in his case...

59:40.285 --> 59:41.912
with the rest of his pretty things.

59:45.665 --> 59:47.292
His souvenirs.

59:49.169 --> 59:51.088
- I am gonna close my eyes.
- No.

59:51.171 --> 59:53.340
- And count to ten.
- Stay awake.

59:53.423 --> 59:54.841
And when I open them...

59:56.635 --> 59:58.095
you will both be gone.

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:05.268
- Ten, nine, eight...
- Do you hear me?

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:07.354
- Stay awake.
- I'm awake.

01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:12.818
Seven, six, five...

01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:17.364
four, three...

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:19.616
two...

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.577
one.

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:39.344
You all right, Mouse?

01:00:47.102 --> 01:00:48.228
I'm so sorry.

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:24.890
I'm sorry you were there when I...

01:01:27.893 --> 01:01:29.477
It's not like I touched you, Jessie.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:32.230
But still...

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:39.196
Maybe we should tell Mom.

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:43.408
I think we have to, don't you?

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:48.205
I hate to...

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:53.168
just because things have been pretty
tense between the two of you lately.

01:01:54.753 --> 01:01:56.963
Hell, they've been tense
between us, too...

01:01:57.631 --> 01:01:59.007
with the baby and all.

01:02:00.425 --> 01:02:01.509
But this...

01:02:04.012 --> 01:02:06.181
well, this could make things a lot worse.

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:12.354
She won't think it's your fault.

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:14.731
I'm sure.

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:18.068
Fairly sure. I mean, she might.

01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:22.155
We all know... it wasn't your fault.

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.119
Maybe we shouldn't tell her.

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:33.458
I have to.

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:36.211
We have to.

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:38.255
Why?

01:02:39.214 --> 01:02:40.632
Because...

01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:45.595
- Because you can't keep it a secret.
- Because you can't keep it a secret.

01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:53.270
I mean, if it's ever going to come out,

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:57.482
then it's better for both of us
that it happen now.

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:02.904
Not in a week or a year or...
even ten years from now.

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:10.120
Please...

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:12.872
I won't tell.

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:16.960
I mean...

01:03:19.421 --> 01:03:21.423
if we don't tell your mom today...

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:24.801
then we could never tell anyone.

01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:26.928
I wouldn't. Never.

01:03:27.012 --> 01:03:28.013
Not ever.

01:03:28.096 --> 01:03:30.432
- Ever.
- And not just your mother.

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:32.976
Not anyone.

01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:38.565
That's a big responsibility
for a little girl.

01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:40.692
I'm sorry.

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:42.527
A young woman.

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:46.156
But you might be tempted.

01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:48.366
With friends...

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:54.080
One of them tells you a secret,
maybe you might wanna tell them.

01:03:55.457 --> 01:03:58.001
- Never.
- Or your brother.

01:03:58.585 --> 01:03:59.586
Or your sister.

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:03.673
There might come a time
when you wanna tell...

01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:04.758
No.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:08.970
No. I promise. I swear.

01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:12.140
I don't know, Jess.

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:19.064
I think it might be better for both of us
if this were all out in the open now.

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:21.358
Take our medicine.

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:24.944
I mean, she can't kill us.

01:04:26.905 --> 01:04:28.281
Please...

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:33.286
Please, please, please.
Please just don't tell her.

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:38.792
I won't tell anybody... ever.

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:42.587
Ever. Please.

01:04:45.256 --> 01:04:50.970
I've never been able to refuse you
anything that you really wanted, have I?

01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:55.183
Okay, Jess.

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:58.061
We'll try things your way.

01:04:58.686 --> 01:05:00.146
Thank you, Daddy.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.901
So I guess we have a deal.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:08.113
I say nothing.

01:05:09.364 --> 01:05:13.701
You say nothing, not to anyone else,
not even to each other.

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:16.663
We walk out of this room...

01:05:18.623 --> 01:05:19.916
and it never happened.

01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:22.961
Okay.

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.342
I did a shameful thing.

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:34.013
You looked away... when you said that.

01:05:36.975 --> 01:05:40.478
You were able to face me with the lies.

01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:45.900
But it was the truth
that finally made you turn away.

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:48.570
<i>I don't know what came over me.</i>

01:05:49.988 --> 01:05:51.322
Maybe it was the eclipse.

01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:58.705
Well, thank God
we'll never see another one.

01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:04.210
Nothing happened.

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:08.381
Nothing ever happened.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:18.141
Come on, let's get grilling.
They should be back in a bit.

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:22.705
He'll try that again.

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:26.543
It's fresher meat.

01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:30.880
You're still strong enough to kick,
but you won't be for long,

01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:32.173
and he can smell that.

01:07:37.428 --> 01:07:38.429
Afternoon already.

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:42.809
Sun's starting down.

01:07:45.144 --> 01:07:46.521
And no one came this morning.

01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:50.567
Or if they did, you were asleep.

01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:58.491
Eventually, someone will find you, Jess,
but it might take a long time.

01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:04.163
The first assumption will be we're off
on some wild romantic fling.

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:05.248
I mean, why not?

01:08:07.125 --> 01:08:08.543
Only you and I know, at the end,

01:08:08.626 --> 01:08:11.379
I could only get it up
if you were handcuffed to the bed.

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:16.426
To the rest of the world,
we're the picture of marital function.

01:08:18.219 --> 01:08:20.721
Sooner or later,
people will start looking, my people.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:25.852
There are a couple of women
in New Orleans you call friends, but...

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.106
You've never really let them
inside your life, have you?

01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:36.529
None of them are gonna worry much
if you drop out of sight for a week or...

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:38.531
ten days.

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:43.620
But I have appointments.

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:48.416
And when I don't show up by Friday,
there'll be questions.

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:53.546
That's how it'll start.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:02.430
I think the caretaker
will actually discover the bodies.

01:09:03.555 --> 01:09:06.893
He'll call the cops when he spots you
through the window or...

01:09:08.519 --> 01:09:09.729
when he smells us.

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:16.402
He'll turn his face away while he throws
the blanket from the closet over you

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:19.488
because he won't wanna see your fingers
sticking through the handcuffs.

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:24.327
Stiff as pencils, white as candles.

01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:27.455
But, most of all...

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:31.501
he won't wanna look at the expression
of horror on your face.

01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:33.461
Why are you doing this?

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:37.881
The forensics unit will show up
with the county coroner.

01:09:39.716 --> 01:09:41.719
When they pull off the blanket,
they will...

01:09:44.055 --> 01:09:48.518
wince and nod and tell each other
the woman on the bed died hard.

01:09:49.227 --> 01:09:51.062
But they won't know the half of it.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:54.524
They won't know...

01:09:56.609 --> 01:09:59.487
the real reason your eyes are staring...

01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:03.074
and your mouth is screaming...

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:08.538
is because of what you saw at the end...

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:11.040
coming out of the dark.

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:18.005
They'll take you to the medical examiner.
He'll cut you open, inventory your guts.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.592
He'll have a peek
at what's left of your last meal,

01:10:21.676 --> 01:10:24.595
take a little section of brain
to look at under his microscope.

01:10:24.679 --> 01:10:25.888
But in the end...

01:10:31.102 --> 01:10:34.522
in the end, he'll just call it
"death by misadventure."

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:40.361
- They were playing a harmless game.
- Harmless.

01:10:41.279 --> 01:10:44.574
Only the gentleman had a heart attack
at a critical moment...

01:10:46.451 --> 01:10:48.661
and the woman was left to...

01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:52.874
Well, it's best not to get into it.

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:57.462
Just to say the lady died hard.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:01.674
You only need to look at her to see that.

01:11:06.637 --> 01:11:09.640
And maybe someone
will notice your wedding ring is gone...

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:16.189
but they won't hunt for it
for long, if at all.

01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:22.862
They won't notice that one
of your bones...

01:11:24.572 --> 01:11:28.284
not an important one, the third phalange
in your right foot, let's say...

01:11:29.494 --> 01:11:32.288
is also gone.

01:11:35.249 --> 01:11:37.460
But we'll know, won't we, Jess?

01:11:40.338 --> 01:11:42.381
We'll know he took them.

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:47.136
Because it was Death.

01:11:49.388 --> 01:11:50.807
And you did see him...

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:55.645
as people who die in the lonely places do.

01:11:58.523 --> 01:11:59.607
It was Death.

01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:05.655
And tonight, when the sun goes down,
he'll be back for you.

01:12:07.782 --> 01:12:11.661
<i>♪ Hush, little baby, don't say a word ♪</i>

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:15.039
<i>♪ Mama's gonna buy you... ♪</i>

01:12:17.708 --> 01:12:21.587
- I'm gonna die.
- Everything dies.

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:23.714
All things serve the beam.

01:12:23.798 --> 01:12:27.385
<i>♪ And if that mockingbird don't sing ♪</i>

01:12:29.804 --> 01:12:32.807
- I'm gonna die.
- Yes, love.

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:37.019
<i>- ♪ Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring ♪</i>
- He'll come quicker that way.

01:12:37.103 --> 01:12:40.064
<i>♪ If that diamond ring turns brass ♪</i>

01:12:40.147 --> 01:12:43.776
That way, you wouldn't have to wait
for the Moonlight Man.

01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:49.323
- I'm going to...
<i>- ...sleep.</i>

01:12:50.992 --> 01:12:52.660
You're going to sleep.

01:12:53.286 --> 01:12:58.708
<i>♪ Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass ♪</i>

01:14:02.813 --> 01:14:03.814
I'm sorry.

01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:07.151
I don't want you to be sorry.

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:09.320
Then what do you want?

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:12.156
I want you to remember.

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.202
You think I don't remember?

01:14:16.911 --> 01:14:18.287
I remember every moment.

01:14:19.246 --> 01:14:23.334
I remember every shame-filled glance
he threw my way, and I remember Mom...

01:14:24.251 --> 01:14:27.088
- looking but not seeing...
- That's not what I'm talking about.

01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:28.172
Because seeing?

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:31.425
It would have meant my little sister
was also doomed

01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:34.178
to let that son of a bitch
steal her childhood,

01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:36.639
and Mom would have died
before facing that.

01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:39.558
So it was up to me to protect Maddie.

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:43.813
Even though it meant that I never felt
like part of the family again.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:51.529
And that wasn't my job description.
Was it? My job was to be a kid.

01:14:52.113 --> 01:14:53.406
Suddenly, that wasn't an option.

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:56.909
You've had everything you need
to survive from the beginning.

01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:59.996
You just have to remember.

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:03.749
Not the sun, not the eclipse.

01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:06.544
After.

01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:10.506
<i>We had fun on the boat.
Should we get one?</i>

01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:11.590
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah?</i>

01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:13.926
I hope it was as pretty here
as it was on the boat.

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:16.345
- It was awesome.
- It was fun.

01:15:16.429 --> 01:15:19.432
"It was fun."

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:22.852
It was beautiful here, too.
Right, Mouse? We had fun.

01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:24.979
Did you have a nice time
with your dad, Jess?

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:32.570
Jesus! Jess, are you okay?

01:15:32.653 --> 01:15:35.489
I'm... I'm...

01:15:35.573 --> 01:15:38.159
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:40.327
Just come on, let's get this cleaned up.

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.387
Oh, it's not so bad.

01:15:59.805 --> 01:16:00.848
I think you'll live.

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:04.935
- Does it hurt?
- It's okay.

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:07.480
Just...

01:16:08.731 --> 01:16:09.774
Just be careful.

01:16:11.692 --> 01:16:12.902
The last thing I want...

01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:16.322
is to have to take you
to the emergency room

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:18.282
and have your fingers sewn back on.

01:16:33.506 --> 01:16:34.590
It's gonna fucking hurt.

01:16:36.342 --> 01:16:38.677
- But the thing about blood...
- But the thing about blood...

01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:41.555
...is that, until it clots,
it's as slick as oil.

01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:43.849
That will not work.

01:16:45.226 --> 01:16:46.227
Maybe not.

01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:51.107
But the wrists have fewer nerves
than the body's other checkpoints.

01:16:51.899 --> 01:16:54.777
That's why slitting wrists
is always the best way to...

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:56.362
How do you know so much about that?

01:16:57.988 --> 01:17:00.533
Go too deep, you'll bleed to death.

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:04.537
Do nothing, I'll die of seizures,
dehydration or dog.

01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:07.873
Or when my visitor with the bag of bones
shows up tonight.

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:10.918
The sun is starting down.
He'll be here soon.

01:17:11.001 --> 01:17:12.419
Then I'll have to hurry.

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:21.554
Barely working, aren't they?

01:17:22.555 --> 01:17:25.141
- I won't need much.
- Your legs won't be reliable.

01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:27.351
It's been a day and a half
since you walked on them.

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:32.982
If my hands pull this off,
my legs better do their fucking part.

01:17:38.195 --> 01:17:39.196
Okay.

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:43.409
Visualize it, then. All of it.

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:44.785
Yeah, okay.

01:17:52.209 --> 01:17:53.210
Okay, okay.

01:18:05.639 --> 01:18:07.850
Once you start,
you're not gonna be able to stop.

01:18:07.933 --> 01:18:11.437
Everything has to go very fast
because your system is already dehydrated.

01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:13.689
- And, Jessie...
- Huh?

01:18:13.772 --> 01:18:15.691
you know, if anything goes wrong...

01:18:15.774 --> 01:18:16.901
It won't matter.

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:20.404
Goodbye.

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:31.957
Okay.

01:18:50.809 --> 01:18:52.478
You stay right there, dog.

01:19:04.198 --> 01:19:06.992
One, two...

01:19:08.327 --> 01:19:09.870
Okay, okay.

01:19:13.499 --> 01:19:14.541
Three!

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.560
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:19:54.748 --> 01:19:56.125
Oh, God!

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:11.200
Come on. Come on.

01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:30.719
Shit!

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:53.575
Okay.

01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:55.411
Okay.

01:23:32.174 --> 01:23:33.258
Get off me!

01:24:57.843 --> 01:25:00.053
You're only made of moonlight.

01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:06.518
You're only made of...

01:25:07.728 --> 01:25:08.729
Moonlight.

01:26:26.098 --> 01:26:28.975
Oh!

01:26:29.059 --> 01:26:30.352
Oh, God.

01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:32.896
Please, just a little bit longer.

01:26:33.397 --> 01:26:37.234
Please just... a little...

01:27:09.224 --> 01:27:10.517
Oh, no.

01:27:15.355 --> 01:27:16.189
Mouse.

01:28:21.254 --> 01:28:22.255
Hi.

01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:03.213
<i>I'm writing this letter
with my right hand,</i>

01:29:03.296 --> 01:29:05.924
<i>nestled snug
in its frictionless burn glove.</i>

01:29:06.883 --> 01:29:09.886
<i>Three skin grafts later,
it still doesn't work quite right,</i>

01:29:09.970 --> 01:29:11.471
<i>and it still hurts to write.</i>

01:29:12.889 --> 01:29:13.890
<i>But that's good.</i>

01:29:15.308 --> 01:29:16.726
<i>This letter should hurt to write.</i>

01:29:20.939 --> 01:29:23.608
<i>The doctors, the cops
and even the reporters</i>

01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:25.861
<i>accepted my amnesia at face value.</i>

01:29:26.403 --> 01:29:27.612
<i>And why not?</i>

01:29:27.696 --> 01:29:30.699
<i>People who undergo serious trauma
often block out memories.</i>

01:29:31.324 --> 01:29:33.493
<i>The cops knew that
even better than the lawyers.</i>

01:29:34.119 --> 01:29:36.079
<i>And I knew it better than any of them.</i>

01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:41.543
<i>Gerald's firm kept the details out
of the papers.</i>

01:29:41.626 --> 01:29:42.752
<i>That was kind.</i>

01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:46.673
<i>The coroners confirmed it was
a heart attack and a long time coming.</i>

01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:52.304
<i>The insurance paid,
the headlines faded, and life went on.</i>

01:29:53.179 --> 01:29:54.180
<i>The new normal.</i>

01:29:57.517 --> 01:29:59.102
<i>Well, not normal.</i>

01:30:00.395 --> 01:30:01.646
<i>Never normal.</i>

01:30:02.606 --> 01:30:05.442
<i>Every night,
just before I closed my eyes...</i>

01:30:35.722 --> 01:30:39.434
<i>If it wasn't him, if it wasn't his face
keeping me from sleep...</i>

01:30:40.393 --> 01:30:41.603
<i>it was the question.</i>

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:44.147
<i>That in all the reports,</i>

01:30:44.230 --> 01:30:46.191
<i>all the cops that combed
through that house,</i>

01:30:46.733 --> 01:30:48.693
<i>they never found my wedding ring.</i>

01:30:52.197 --> 01:30:54.115
<i>What got me through those nights was you.</i>

01:30:55.283 --> 01:30:56.451
<i>Thinking of you.</i>

01:30:57.702 --> 01:30:59.996
<i>And why you came to me that day.</i>

01:31:01.039 --> 01:31:04.709
<i>You, in your sunless world,
always on that swing.</i>

01:31:06.044 --> 01:31:07.796
<i>What you needed me to understand...</i>

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:14.761
<i>that his shackles were silence,</i>

01:31:16.846 --> 01:31:19.057
<i>and his were comfort.</i>

01:31:24.396 --> 01:31:25.689
<i>My days were better.</i>

01:31:26.398 --> 01:31:27.482
<i>I took the insurance money,</i>

01:31:27.565 --> 01:31:31.820
<i>and I started a foundation
for girls and boys like us.</i>

01:31:32.862 --> 01:31:37.784
<i>I spent so long never telling that story,
so... I made sure that I did.</i>

01:31:38.702 --> 01:31:42.831
<i>I tell that story every day
to every kid it could possibly help.</i>

01:31:43.456 --> 01:31:48.586
When I was 12,
I went to the lake house with my family.

01:31:49.337 --> 01:31:52.424
<i>And while that helped my days,
I still sat up at night...</i>

01:31:54.801 --> 01:31:57.220
<i>waiting for that pale face
in the moonlight...</i>

01:31:59.139 --> 01:32:00.974
<i>to claim his runaway bride.</i>

01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:10.191
<i>Six months after the handcuffs,
six months of being a widow...</i>

01:32:11.067 --> 01:32:13.194
<i>six months of living death.</i>

01:32:13.987 --> 01:32:18.700
<i>And then Raymond Andrew Joubert's picture</i>

01:32:18.783 --> 01:32:20.535
<i>first appeared in the paper.</i>

01:32:24.289 --> 01:32:26.708
<i>Two years ago,
reports of graveyard vandalism</i>

01:32:26.791 --> 01:32:28.918
<i>in the backwoods of Alabama
hit the papers,</i>

01:32:29.502 --> 01:32:32.464
<i>but I never read about them,
not in New Orleans.</i>

01:32:33.256 --> 01:32:35.550
<i>And they were tiny stories, buried.</i>

01:32:36.134 --> 01:32:38.636
<i>Someone was breaking
into crypts and mausoleums</i>

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:43.391
<i>of small town cemeteries
with drills, bolt cutters and hacksaws...</i>

01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:45.894
<i>and stripping corpses of jewelry.</i>

01:32:46.728 --> 01:32:48.605
<i>As the months went by, it escalated.</i>

01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:51.316
<i>Incidents started being reported
in Louisiana.</i>

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:55.278
<i>He gouged out eyes, cut corpses' throats.</i>

01:32:56.279 --> 01:32:58.948
<i>Last February,
two were found without noses.</i>

01:32:59.657 --> 01:33:02.869
<i>Later hands. Then... ears.</i>

01:33:04.579 --> 01:33:06.539
<i>Something I'd always assumed was the dog.</i>

01:33:07.832 --> 01:33:11.711
<i>And when it came to removing genitalia
after having sex with the dead...</i>

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:14.506
<i>he stuck strictly to the gentlemen.</i>

01:33:15.131 --> 01:33:17.300
<i>This was, clearly, extremely lucky for me.</i>

01:33:19.344 --> 01:33:21.930
<i>I only noticed
when he finally made the front page.</i>

01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:24.974
<i>He'd graduated, it seemed, from the dead.</i>

01:33:25.475 --> 01:33:29.187
<i>And, one night, a man woke up
to find Raymond Joubert in his room,</i>

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:31.648
<i>naked, trying to cut off his ear.</i>

01:33:33.024 --> 01:33:35.109
<i>Joubert suffers from acromegaly,</i>

01:33:35.193 --> 01:33:38.446
<i>a progressive enlargement
of the hands, feet and face</i>

01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:41.324
<i>that happens when the pituitary gland
goes into warp drive.</i>

01:33:41.991 --> 01:33:43.827
<i>It causes the forehead to bulge</i>

01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:47.539
<i>and abnormally long arms
that dangle almost to his knees.</i>

01:33:48.998 --> 01:33:52.418
<i>They went to his only known address,
a farmhouse on Kingston Road.</i>

01:33:53.044 --> 01:33:54.337
<i>They didn't find him there,</i>

01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:56.714
<i>but they did find his sister
and her husband,</i>

01:33:57.298 --> 01:33:59.634
<i>who he called his "mommy and daddy."</i>

01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:04.097
<i>He'd scalped them both
and eaten most of "Daddy."</i>

01:34:05.056 --> 01:34:09.936
<i>They found 50 bell jars
containing ears, lips, fingers.</i>

01:34:10.728 --> 01:34:14.524
<i>They think he may have killed as many
as a dozen people in the last five years.</i>

01:34:14.607 --> 01:34:16.651
<i>But, for some reason, he spared me.</i>

01:34:17.610 --> 01:34:21.447
<i>This monster was real, real as they come.</i>

01:34:22.448 --> 01:34:25.118
<i>As real as the cuffs, as the dog.</i>

01:34:26.536 --> 01:34:28.037
<i>As real as the eclipse.</i>

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:32.333
<i>And so I had to write this
to you, Mouse...</i>

01:34:33.626 --> 01:34:35.753
<i>because you're the only person
who'd understand...</i>

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:38.715
<i>and you're the only one who truly matters.</i>

01:34:42.051 --> 01:34:45.388
"He's being arraigned
tomorrow, and I'm going to see him.

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:49.392
Because the people who were supposed
to protect you from the monsters...

01:34:50.143 --> 01:34:52.312
turned out to be monsters themselves...

01:34:53.313 --> 01:34:55.064
and it almost killed you."

01:34:56.232 --> 01:34:58.109
We need the sun to come back out.

01:34:59.152 --> 01:35:00.194
After so long...

01:35:01.696 --> 01:35:03.281
I think we deserve the sun.

01:35:07.702 --> 01:35:10.747
This morning, it was announced
that cameras would not be allowed

01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:12.665
inside the courtroom for the arraignment,

01:35:12.749 --> 01:35:17.462
an unusual decision in a case
that's already full of surprises.

01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:19.631
But nothing more unusual than the way...

01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:22.884
Sources within the Alabama State
Police Department tell us

01:35:22.967 --> 01:35:26.721
Raymond Andrew Joubert hasn't spoken
a single word since his arrest,

01:35:26.804 --> 01:35:28.723
not even to his public defender.

01:35:28.806 --> 01:35:32.185
Sixteen counts
trespassing and vandalism.

01:35:33.061 --> 01:35:34.729
Eighteen counts desecration.

01:35:36.105 --> 01:35:38.358
Eight counts first-degree murder.

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.236
Twenty-one counts mutilation.

01:35:41.861 --> 01:35:44.113
Twenty-eight counts
desecrating human remains.

01:35:45.198 --> 01:35:47.784
Sixteen counts breaking and entering.

01:35:47.867 --> 01:35:48.701
Hey.

01:35:48.785 --> 01:35:51.371
- Four counts, assault and battery.
- Hey!

01:35:53.122 --> 01:35:53.957
Ma'am?

01:35:58.836 --> 01:36:00.004
You're not real!

01:36:05.385 --> 01:36:06.928
You're not real!

01:36:07.011 --> 01:36:08.346
Officer!

01:36:08.846 --> 01:36:11.891
You're only made of moonlight!

01:36:40.044 --> 01:36:42.380
You're so much smaller than I remember.
