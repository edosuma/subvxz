WEBVTT

00:00.704 --> 00:02.005
I think you hit it
out of the park.

00:02.039 --> 00:04.674
I don't feel this is
a very successful makeup.

00:04.708 --> 00:07.110
You could not have
done a better job.

00:07.144 --> 00:08.711
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

00:08.746 --> 00:10.613
Stephanie and Kelly's
mechanical housewife

00:10.648 --> 00:13.449
brought Stephanie her first win,

00:13.484 --> 00:15.952
but Regina stumbled
and was the first on Team Rayce

00:15.986 --> 00:17.186
to be sent home.

00:21.358 --> 00:23.760
Now 11 artists remain,

00:23.794 --> 00:26.796
and tonight they'll dive
into the world of fantasy...

00:26.830 --> 00:29.165
- Oh, my gosh.
- How much do we have?

00:29.199 --> 00:30.833
- Not much time.
- Damn it, damn it, damn it.

00:30.868 --> 00:32.235
I am worried for Kelly
on this one.

00:32.269 --> 00:33.436
And witness the genius

00:33.470 --> 00:35.271
of Hollywood's
greatest creature actor.

00:35.306 --> 00:36.572
Hello.

00:36.607 --> 00:39.275
This is amazing.
Doug Jones is one-of-a-kind.

00:39.310 --> 00:41.911
This is something I would be
proud to wear myself on film.

00:41.945 --> 00:43.346
In the end, only one

00:43.380 --> 00:45.982
will win a VIP trip from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

00:46.016 --> 00:48.551
to one of their 85
international locations,

00:48.585 --> 00:51.654
a brand new 2015 Fiat 500,

00:51.689 --> 00:53.656
and $100,000.

What do you guys want?

01:35.432 --> 01:36.532
Bacon sounds delicious.

01:38.769 --> 01:40.403
Two bottom looks in a row.

01:40.437 --> 01:42.138
I'm frigging determined
at this point.

01:42.172 --> 01:44.707
I'm the only person
in the house, other than Adam,

01:44.742 --> 01:47.410
who's had two bottom looks.

01:47.444 --> 01:49.011
Yeah, that sucks.

01:49.046 --> 01:51.547
I cannot afford
to be in bottom this week.

01:51.582 --> 01:52.648
I'm sick of being on bottom.

01:52.683 --> 01:53.883
I want to be on top again.

01:53.917 --> 01:55.952
I need to show showcase
what I can do.

01:55.986 --> 01:57.987
I have a lot
to prove at this point.

01:58.021 --> 01:59.722
I'm just gonna
do what I want to do,

01:59.757 --> 02:00.923
what I think is gonna look good.

02:00.958 --> 02:02.692
I'm gonna make it to the finale.

02:12.002 --> 02:13.136
- Yes!
- Look at that bridge.

02:13.170 --> 02:14.237
Ooh, wonderful!

02:14.271 --> 02:15.671
We're walking
down the LA River...

02:15.706 --> 02:16.672
This is exciting.

02:16.707 --> 02:17.940
And all I can think is,

02:17.975 --> 02:19.809
"So many movies have shot here."

02:19.843 --> 02:21.043
It's amazing.

02:21.078 --> 02:22.478
This place is awesome.

02:22.513 --> 02:26.048
However, I actually have no clue
what we're gonna be doing.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.218
- Hey, guys.
All: - Hi!

02:29.253 --> 02:31.053
It's here, underneath
these iconic bridges

02:31.088 --> 02:32.355
at the LA River,

02:32.389 --> 02:34.557
that the Terminator himself
hopped on his Harley

02:34.591 --> 02:39.195
and outran a T-1000 in James
Cameron's classic chase scene

02:39.229 --> 02:40.196
from <i> Terminator 2.</i>

02:40.230 --> 02:41.531
Hell yeah.

02:41.565 --> 02:44.100
We might also recognize it
from movies like <i>Grease,</i>

02:44.134 --> 02:46.402
<i>Chinatown,</i> and <i> Escape From LA.</i>

02:46.437 --> 02:47.770
Yeah.

02:47.805 --> 02:50.373
Bridges are a functional
necessity of everyday life,

02:50.407 --> 02:52.942
but they can also
be design marvels,

02:52.976 --> 02:54.544
becoming beautiful testaments

02:54.578 --> 02:56.913
to mankind's engineering
achievements.

02:56.947 --> 03:00.550
However, in the world
of fantasy and fairy tales,

03:00.584 --> 03:04.554
they're also home to a classic
mythological character...

03:04.588 --> 03:06.155
Oh, my gosh.

03:06.190 --> 03:07.156
Trolls.

03:07.191 --> 03:09.192
Both: Yay!

03:09.226 --> 03:11.761
Trolls!

03:11.795 --> 03:14.630
I can't describe
how excited I am.

03:14.665 --> 03:18.301
According to myth,
these oafish but devious trolls

03:18.335 --> 03:20.803
lurk underneath bridges,
devouring those

03:20.838 --> 03:22.738
who dare to pass.

03:22.773 --> 03:25.141
So, your spotlight challenge

03:25.175 --> 03:28.077
is to select one
of these incredible bridges

03:28.111 --> 03:29.812
and create the troll
that lives beneath it.

03:29.847 --> 03:32.381
Oh, that's awesome.

03:32.416 --> 03:33.983
Knowing that it's
a troll challenge,

03:34.017 --> 03:35.051
it, like, clicks in my mind.

03:35.085 --> 03:37.320
"Okay, this is awesome.
I can do this."

03:37.354 --> 03:39.322
I love all things fantasy.

03:39.356 --> 03:42.525
The choices are the Golden
Gate Bridge in San Francisco,

03:42.559 --> 03:44.393
Tower Bridge in London,

03:44.428 --> 03:46.929
Corvin Castle Bridge
in Transylvania,

03:46.964 --> 03:50.766
Dragon Bridge at the Monkey
Forest Sanctuary in Bali,

03:50.801 --> 03:52.668
Helix Bridge in Singapore,

03:52.703 --> 03:55.071
and Python Bridge in Amsterdam.

03:55.105 --> 03:56.506
Adam, you're up first.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.508
Select your bridge.

04:12.389 --> 04:14.590
Now, before you start
working on your designs,

04:14.625 --> 04:17.426
I've got a big surprise for you.

04:17.461 --> 04:18.928
The character and the movement

04:18.962 --> 04:21.664
of a troll is key
to how they express themselves,

04:21.697 --> 04:22.899
and I really want to make sure

04:22.933 --> 04:24.867
that your models
understand that,

04:24.902 --> 04:27.270
so on application day,

04:27.304 --> 04:30.673
I'm bringing in a secret weapon
to help them out.

04:30.707 --> 04:33.409
He happens to be
Hollywood's most sought-after

04:33.443 --> 04:35.011
creature actor.

04:35.045 --> 04:38.281
You've seen his incredible work
in <i> Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy,</i>

04:38.315 --> 04:40.383
and <i> Fantastic Four</i>
<i>Rise Of The Silver Surfer.</i>

04:40.417 --> 04:41.684
- Hellboy!
- You're kidding me.

04:41.718 --> 04:42.952
Doug Jones.

04:42.986 --> 04:44.487
- Whoo!
- Oh!

04:44.521 --> 04:46.556
That's going to be exciting
to have Doug Jones here.

04:46.590 --> 04:49.225
He's behind all these amazing
characters and their movements.

04:49.259 --> 04:50.660
I can't wait
to actually meet him

04:50.694 --> 04:52.461
and hear what he has
to say to our models.

04:53.897 --> 04:55.565
All right, it's time
to get started, guys.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.767
Now, make sure you keep in mind

04:57.801 --> 05:01.304
not only the architectural
design, but also the location

05:01.338 --> 05:03.072
and cultural setting
of the bridge

05:03.106 --> 05:04.874
when creating your trolls.

05:04.908 --> 05:06.075
Good luck, guys.

05:06.109 --> 05:07.109
See you!

05:17.154 --> 05:19.455
I got the Helix Bridge
in Singapore.

05:19.489 --> 05:21.190
Singapore used to be
a rain forest,

05:21.224 --> 05:24.961
so my idea is that my troll
fell asleep in this rain forest,

05:24.995 --> 05:27.730
and wakes up
in this crazy modern society,

05:27.764 --> 05:29.532
and he starts to genetically

05:29.566 --> 05:32.602
modify himself to be able
to blend into the Helix Bridge.

05:36.406 --> 05:39.008
I'm glad we finally
have a fantasy challenge.

05:39.042 --> 05:41.310
I dig it.
That's my style.

05:41.345 --> 05:43.980
Corvin Castle in Transylvania
was the inspiration

05:44.014 --> 05:45.314
for Dracula's castle,

05:45.349 --> 05:48.284
so I'm thinking that this troll
is a servant to Dracula.

05:48.318 --> 05:49.885
He's going
to be very stone-colored,

05:49.920 --> 05:52.221
matching the color
of the bridge itself.

05:55.859 --> 05:57.526
I got the Corvin Castle Bridge.

05:57.561 --> 05:59.562
My Transylvanian troll blends

05:59.596 --> 06:02.031
into the willow trees
and attacks people

06:02.065 --> 06:04.066
that Dracula doesn't approve of.

06:04.101 --> 06:06.702
I'm gonna try and stick
with a gloomy, scary troll.

06:06.737 --> 06:07.937
It's gonna be awesome.

06:09.706 --> 06:11.707
The history
of the Dragon Bridge in Bali

06:11.742 --> 06:14.610
is that the two statues
guarded the healing waters

06:14.645 --> 06:15.745
that are beyond it,

06:15.779 --> 06:17.580
so I decide that the troll

06:17.614 --> 06:19.915
is camouflaged
by the trees and the moss,

06:19.950 --> 06:22.351
and that he protects
the stone-like guardians.

06:24.921 --> 06:27.857
I chose the Dragon Bridge
at the Monkey Sanctuary in Bali,

06:27.891 --> 06:31.360
and my troll is a fallen warrior
that was given new life,

06:31.395 --> 06:34.096
but his new life is the curse
of being a troll

06:34.131 --> 06:35.197
and protecting the bridge.

06:35.232 --> 06:37.667
The vines
create this hunched silhouette,

06:37.701 --> 06:40.569
and the rest
of it will be brought to life

06:40.604 --> 06:42.405
through costuming
and fabrications.

06:45.175 --> 06:47.610
All right everybody,
let's go back to the lab.

06:53.050 --> 06:54.884
Excited!

06:54.918 --> 06:57.420
We get back to the lab,
and we pick our models,

06:57.454 --> 06:59.121
and we have 5 1/2 hours
to work today.

07:01.692 --> 07:04.593
Amsterdam originated
as a fishing village,

07:04.628 --> 07:06.629
and so I'm making
a water-dwelling troll

07:06.663 --> 07:09.031
who is tormenting the fishermen,

07:09.066 --> 07:12.034
but I'm still not really
sold on anything right now,

07:12.069 --> 07:13.869
so I have a lot
of work ahead of me.

07:19.009 --> 07:20.342
Hi!

07:21.344 --> 07:22.745
Come.

07:22.779 --> 07:25.147
Rayce comes in, and he pulls
us together for a team meeting.

07:25.182 --> 07:27.583
When it comes
to the conceptual stuff,

07:27.617 --> 07:30.352
you guys have to think
where no one's thinking.

07:30.387 --> 07:32.521
Reinvent trolls.

07:32.556 --> 07:33.756
I want to make sure that no one

07:33.790 --> 07:35.925
is doing
the traditional big nose.

07:35.959 --> 07:37.860
If we've seen
those trolls before,

07:37.894 --> 07:39.128
it's not gonna go well.

07:39.162 --> 07:42.231
I have four people left,
and I really want to keep them,

07:42.265 --> 07:43.566
so I'm really
pushing these guys.

07:43.600 --> 07:44.700
- Okay?
- All right.

07:44.735 --> 07:45.901
It's time to move, gentlemen.

07:45.936 --> 07:47.103
All right.

07:47.137 --> 07:48.604
Word up.

07:52.876 --> 07:54.910
My bridge
is the Tower Bridge in London,

07:54.945 --> 07:56.746
so I want to keep
the regal aspect of it.

07:56.780 --> 07:57.980
My backstory is a prince

07:58.014 --> 07:59.482
that fell in love
with a princess,

07:59.516 --> 08:02.118
but the king's not too happy
about their courtship,

08:02.152 --> 08:03.886
so he turns him into the troll.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.821
I'm really taking Rayce's
advice on this one,

08:05.856 --> 08:08.991
and I'm not going with
the traditional large forehead.

08:09.025 --> 08:10.493
I'm extending the back
of the head,

08:10.527 --> 08:12.361
and I want to add horns
to the top.

08:12.395 --> 08:14.497
So hopefully I can make
it stand out.

08:14.531 --> 08:16.031
I'm really excited
about this piece.

08:24.007 --> 08:25.775
I'm gonna
incorporate the cliff texture

08:25.809 --> 08:30.579
into doing a
shoulder-chest-back, one piece.

08:30.614 --> 08:34.082
My concept is a girl jumped
off the Golden Gate Bridge

08:34.116 --> 08:35.284
during sunset.

08:35.318 --> 08:37.553
Her body washed ashore
to the little island,

08:37.587 --> 08:39.054
and became one of the rocks,

08:39.089 --> 08:41.991
and she climbs up the bridge
during sunrise and sunset

08:42.025 --> 08:43.225
to drag people down.

08:43.260 --> 08:45.194
- Like, that kind of sunset...
- Yeah.

08:45.228 --> 08:46.695
- Fuse colors?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

08:46.730 --> 08:49.265
Ooh, so more of a spritely
kind of character, I like it.

08:49.299 --> 08:51.767
I want something
very lean, very feminine.

08:51.802 --> 08:53.969
My coach, Laura,
is on board with it,

08:54.004 --> 08:55.304
so I'm gonna run with that.

08:55.338 --> 08:56.705
I think you're in a good place.

08:59.342 --> 09:00.309
- Hi, everybody!
- Hello.

09:00.343 --> 09:01.310
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:01.344 --> 09:02.845
Hello.

09:02.879 --> 09:04.747
I'm gonna troll over here
and see what you're doing.

09:04.781 --> 09:05.948
So, what bridge did you get?

09:05.982 --> 09:08.117
So, I have the Python Bridge
in Amsterdam.

09:08.151 --> 09:09.385
During the summertime,

09:09.419 --> 09:11.587
children will play on the bridge
and jump into the water.

09:11.621 --> 09:13.322
It'll actually look
like a regular girl,

09:13.356 --> 09:15.624
but when she turns around,
she's this hideous troll.

09:15.659 --> 09:17.560
I've changed this probably
five times.

09:17.594 --> 09:19.395
I think you've got
a great direction going.

09:19.429 --> 09:21.197
You need more bulk,
though, in the face.

09:21.231 --> 09:23.365
You need to bring up the fantasy
and the character in it.

09:23.400 --> 09:24.533
Right.

09:24.568 --> 09:27.136
My bridge
is the Tower Bridge in London,

09:27.170 --> 09:30.840
and my troll is this mother
whose child died on the bridge,

09:30.874 --> 09:34.443
so she will forever haunt
this bridge in revenge.

09:34.477 --> 09:36.645
Your technique
for your sculpture is great,

09:36.680 --> 09:39.748
but I think you need to pull
a little bit more troll into it.

09:39.783 --> 09:41.750
Give her some more lower lip.

09:41.785 --> 09:43.385
This could have
more weight to it.

09:43.420 --> 09:44.820
It could even be
a little bulbous,

09:44.855 --> 09:46.455
as opposed
to trying to make it narrow.

09:46.489 --> 09:47.690
Awesome. Thank you so much.

09:47.724 --> 09:49.391
I got the Golden Gate Bridge.

09:49.426 --> 09:51.527
San Francisco burned
to the ground in the mid-1800s,

09:51.561 --> 09:54.430
so I'm giving the toll
a burned look,

09:54.464 --> 09:55.564
and he's wearing a mask

09:55.599 --> 09:57.433
to worship the crows
of San Francisco.

09:57.467 --> 09:58.901
I think your
sculpture looks great.

09:58.935 --> 10:00.202
You can paint this,

10:00.237 --> 10:03.172
and get black down into
those crevices and everything,

10:03.206 --> 10:05.441
and then dry brush,
or with a sponge,

10:05.475 --> 10:07.776
going over the top of it
and picking up highlights.

10:07.811 --> 10:09.445
You want it to be
able to pop out.

10:09.479 --> 10:10.579
Thanks very much.

10:10.614 --> 10:13.082
I have the Python Bridge
in Amsterdam.

10:13.116 --> 10:14.683
I would go
a little bit more traditional

10:14.718 --> 10:16.285
with the troll nose.

10:16.319 --> 10:17.853
- This is a fantasy character...
- Right.

10:17.888 --> 10:19.889
And so you can add
some depth to that.

10:19.923 --> 10:20.890
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

10:20.924 --> 10:22.091
All right.
Thank you so much.

10:22.125 --> 10:23.792
I have the Dragon Bridge.

10:23.827 --> 10:25.027
Oh, and you have it right here.

10:25.061 --> 10:27.229
I just want to incorporate
a lot of the moss,

10:27.264 --> 10:29.431
and a lot of the greenery
in there.

10:29.466 --> 10:31.934
Don't cover it
with so much vegetation

10:31.968 --> 10:33.302
that you can't see it at all.

10:33.336 --> 10:35.304
When you apply it,
there should be some thought

10:35.338 --> 10:38.240
of how this is, like,
the branches of the tree.

10:38.275 --> 10:40.009
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.
- Thank you.

10:40.043 --> 10:41.243
Bye, everybody.

10:41.278 --> 10:42.278
- Bye.
All: - Bye.

10:42.312 --> 10:43.646
See you under the bridge.

10:45.849 --> 10:48.517
After Mr. Westmore leaves,
I start to bulk out the nose,

10:48.551 --> 10:50.352
'cause that was one
of his first suggestions,

10:50.387 --> 10:52.755
and I get kind of stuck.

10:52.789 --> 10:54.890
This is totally throwing
me right now.

10:54.925 --> 10:56.358
I talked to Laura about it...

10:56.393 --> 10:58.060
Bring the nostrils in.

10:58.094 --> 10:59.762
I'm liking her ideas,

10:59.796 --> 11:00.963
but at the same time,

11:00.997 --> 11:03.599
I'm not seeing them
in my finished product,

11:03.633 --> 11:05.467
so now I'm kind of at this wall.

11:07.837 --> 11:09.138
I just hate it.

11:09.172 --> 11:11.340
I can't figure this shit out.

11:11.374 --> 11:13.909
This could be the challenge
that puts me on the bottom

11:13.944 --> 11:15.411
and sends me home.

11:15.412 --> 11:16.412
I don't know.

11:24.490 --> 11:26.257
It's day
one of the troll challenge,

11:26.292 --> 11:28.126
and I'm at this wall.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.962
I can't figure this shit out.

11:30.997 --> 11:32.430
I just hate it.

11:32.465 --> 11:35.367
I decided the best thing to do
is start blocking out the cowl.

11:37.036 --> 11:39.671
I've wasted five hours
of this challenge,

11:39.705 --> 11:42.340
so I'm just really nervous,

11:42.375 --> 11:43.908
and stressed, and frustrated.

11:43.943 --> 11:47.812
I don't know how much texture
I'm thinking about.

11:47.847 --> 11:49.814
If I can figure out
the shapes of the cowl,

11:49.849 --> 11:51.983
then the face
might work itself out.

11:59.692 --> 12:01.793
It's time
for us coaches to leave,

12:01.827 --> 12:04.429
and I am most
worried about Darla.

12:04.463 --> 12:07.365
I hope she's able to get
past this funk.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.733
- Relax.
- Yeah.

12:08.768 --> 12:11.302
- Tomorrow will be a better day.
- Exactly.

12:11.337 --> 12:13.204
- Keep rolling on it.
- Thanks, man.

12:13.239 --> 12:14.205
I appreciate it.

12:14.240 --> 12:15.273
Great job today.

12:20.946 --> 12:22.514
Logan, how much time
do we have left?

12:22.548 --> 12:23.648
30 minutes.

12:23.683 --> 12:25.483
Rayce says not to do
what's expected,

12:25.518 --> 12:27.952
so I'm making
one side very rocky,

12:27.987 --> 12:30.321
but then what I'm having
is the rocks start to fade off

12:30.356 --> 12:33.091
into these very smooth,
angular shapes,

12:33.125 --> 12:35.330
because they have
such a modern society

12:35.365 --> 12:37.533
that he's trying to fit in.

12:37.567 --> 12:39.735
Hopefully the judges
are going to understand

12:39.769 --> 12:40.769
what I'm trying to do.

12:42.806 --> 12:43.872
That's time, everybody.

12:47.444 --> 12:49.078
I just feel like
they're not gonna be able

12:49.112 --> 12:50.646
to look at it and just get it.

12:50.680 --> 12:53.949
I'm thinking, "Am I
doing something wrong?"

12:55.452 --> 12:57.386
I am so nervous for tomorrow.

13:06.996 --> 13:08.530
And so it begins.

13:08.565 --> 13:11.066
So, it's day two
of our bridge troll challenge.

13:11.101 --> 13:12.835
We have 9 1/2 hours in the lab.

13:12.869 --> 13:14.103
- Good morning!
- Hello.

13:18.108 --> 13:20.042
There are a lot of trees
around the bridge,

13:20.076 --> 13:23.011
so I want to incorporate the
wood texture into the sculpt.

13:24.380 --> 13:26.281
I have done wood texture before.

13:26.316 --> 13:29.585
It's really difficult, but I
can't play it safe anymore.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.820
I like it a lot.

13:31.855 --> 13:32.855
I like it too.

13:37.961 --> 13:39.628
I want to try
to bring it back a little bit,

13:39.662 --> 13:41.448
just so you have
a good edge there.

13:41.449 --> 13:43.498
With only three people
left in the competition,

13:43.499 --> 13:44.899
I really don't want
to go down to two.

13:44.934 --> 13:48.303
Luckily, Ben, Kelly,
and Jamie are very talented,

13:48.337 --> 13:50.605
so I'm confident in my team.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.309
This is your best sculpture yet.

13:54.343 --> 13:56.311
Yeah, I'm really happy
with the forms

13:56.345 --> 13:57.845
that are happening on this face.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.547
I'm feeling better
about my sculpture.

13:59.582 --> 14:00.848
It's a big risk

14:00.883 --> 14:03.284
not going with, like,
the very traditional troll,

14:03.319 --> 14:05.453
but I'm staying positive,
and I'm staying confident,

14:05.487 --> 14:08.022
and I'm just going to keep going
and hope for the best.

14:12.361 --> 14:14.362
Looking at the reference photo
of the Golden Gate,

14:14.396 --> 14:18.700
there's a little island that has
more of a rocky style to it,

14:18.734 --> 14:21.803
so I decided to use rock texture
on my sculpts.

14:23.138 --> 14:24.872
It's definitely
gonna be different,

14:24.907 --> 14:26.240
but I am happy with my sculpt,

14:26.275 --> 14:27.809
so I'm gonna run
into the mold room

14:27.843 --> 14:29.510
and start molding everything.

14:31.146 --> 14:32.747
It's not my favorite,

14:32.781 --> 14:34.115
but it's all right.

14:34.149 --> 14:35.116
I'll get pieces done,

14:35.150 --> 14:36.851
and I'll do a killer paint job,

14:36.885 --> 14:38.152
and it'll be all fine.

14:38.187 --> 14:40.688
I'm working hard
on these sculpts,

14:40.723 --> 14:44.058
and I'm still not in love
with either one of them,

14:44.093 --> 14:47.328
but at this point I know I don't
have time to change my mind.

14:47.363 --> 14:49.464
I just need to get these
into the mold room

14:49.498 --> 14:51.599
so that I have pieces
on application day.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.876
Trolls usually
tend to be a nasty creature,

15:01.910 --> 15:03.778
but I'm trying
to incorporate playfulness,

15:03.812 --> 15:06.481
so I want her to have
a big beer-belly on her.

15:09.018 --> 15:11.552
When I come in tomorrow,
I'll cut open the swimsuit

15:11.587 --> 15:13.421
and expose some of the sculpt
that I've done.

15:13.455 --> 15:16.357
Hopefully this complete change
will show the judges

15:16.392 --> 15:18.192
that I'm able to create
something that's fun.

15:24.533 --> 15:25.833
This is a very big cowl.

15:25.868 --> 15:27.669
I'm extending the back
of the head a little bit,

15:27.703 --> 15:30.471
and I want to add horns
to the top.

15:30.506 --> 15:33.365
I'm a little worried
that it looks kind of alien-ish.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.379
I'm not going
too troll on this one.

15:35.414 --> 15:36.678
But it's kind of too late
to change my idea.

15:36.712 --> 15:37.779
I've got to go with this.

15:37.813 --> 15:39.380
I kind of
like the head shape, Rob.

15:39.415 --> 15:40.381
Yeah?

15:40.416 --> 15:41.382
Rayce is liking the sculpt.

15:41.417 --> 15:42.817
He kind of likes
the elongated head.

15:42.851 --> 15:43.918
I'm going with his instinct,

15:43.952 --> 15:45.319
and I'm rolling ahead with it.

15:45.354 --> 15:47.488
Just keep cracking on it,
and keep watching that clock

15:47.523 --> 15:49.557
to make sure you're getting
in there when you need to.

15:49.591 --> 15:51.659
- Good luck!
- Yes, thank you.

15:51.694 --> 15:53.194
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, guys.

16:02.705 --> 16:04.405
I build the back piece
on a mannequin

16:04.440 --> 16:05.707
for the character's silhouette,

16:05.741 --> 16:07.842
and the first thing I do
is I grab a block of foam

16:07.876 --> 16:09.477
and begin to shape it
like a hump.

16:12.881 --> 16:16.084
Because the troll lives
under the Dragon Bridge in Bali,

16:16.118 --> 16:19.220
the back piece is going
to be consisted of large vines,

16:19.254 --> 16:21.456
and hemp, and leaves,

16:21.490 --> 16:22.623
and some snake textures,

16:22.658 --> 16:25.193
so that it looks
like one cohesive design.

16:33.001 --> 16:34.769
I took my face to open it,

16:34.803 --> 16:36.738
and my mold doesn't go anywhere.

16:36.772 --> 16:40.041
Oh my God, it's locked.

16:40.075 --> 16:43.244
If this doesn't open up,
I don't have a face.

16:45.214 --> 16:47.415
I leave it aside because I
don't want to think about it,

16:47.449 --> 16:48.716
I want to work
on something else,

16:48.751 --> 16:50.618
so I start to open
the chest mold...

16:50.652 --> 16:53.488
If you can just
press down on that.

16:53.522 --> 16:55.189
Logan helps me get it out.

16:55.224 --> 16:57.125
Oh, shit.

16:57.159 --> 16:59.594
Okay, you definitely
have a crack.

16:59.628 --> 17:00.995
Great, it's cracking.

17:01.029 --> 17:02.230
Oh my God.

17:03.332 --> 17:05.767
I don't have time to fix this.

17:07.536 --> 17:09.170
I don't think I'm gonna
have my molds done.

17:09.204 --> 17:10.304
Shit.

17:10.339 --> 17:12.373
I'm just feeling
so afraid right now,

17:12.406 --> 17:15.209
because I won't have
any pieces tomorrow.

17:15.243 --> 17:17.178
I don't know what to do.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.243
It's day two of our
troll challenge.

17:25.279 --> 17:26.579
My face mold's locked,

17:26.613 --> 17:28.446
and my torso mold is cracked.

17:28.482 --> 17:29.448
Shit.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.584
This is such a train wreck.

17:31.618 --> 17:34.487
I need to get the face out
no matter what.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.589
Ben takes the chisel
and starts hammering it,

17:36.623 --> 17:39.225
but it's still not opening up.

17:39.259 --> 17:42.261
Finally, somehow, it pops open.

17:42.296 --> 17:44.130
Thank you so much.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.898
I feel so much better,

17:45.933 --> 17:49.101
but now I don't have time
to fix my torso mold.

17:49.136 --> 17:51.270
I take it to the pressure
washer, clean it out,

17:51.305 --> 17:52.705
and put it back together,

17:52.739 --> 17:54.874
but because the mold
is so beaten-up,

17:54.908 --> 17:56.876
the foam latex
is gonna be a mess,

17:56.910 --> 17:59.345
and trimming and patching
is gonna be very difficult

17:59.379 --> 18:01.547
and time-consuming.

18:01.582 --> 18:04.050
All right, everybody.
That's time.

18:04.084 --> 18:07.486
I'm so flustered
and just disappointed.

18:07.521 --> 18:10.489
Application day is a disaster.

18:19.600 --> 18:20.700
It's application day.

18:20.734 --> 18:22.468
We have four hours in the lab

18:22.503 --> 18:25.571
and one hour for last looks.

18:25.606 --> 18:28.374
Doug Jones is going to be
interacting with our models

18:28.409 --> 18:30.677
to get them more
into this troll character,

18:30.711 --> 18:32.378
and I can't wait.

18:32.413 --> 18:33.913
- What's up, man?
- Bam!

18:33.947 --> 18:35.048
Oh, gosh.

18:35.082 --> 18:38.251
I look at my foam, and...

18:38.285 --> 18:39.619
This is not good.

18:39.653 --> 18:41.754
I've never seen foam this thick.

18:41.789 --> 18:44.338
My edges are horrific.

18:44.340 --> 18:47.107
Yeah.
It'll take a little time.

18:47.142 --> 18:48.876
I have to make it work.

18:51.946 --> 18:54.882
- Hi!
- It's so good to see you!

18:54.916 --> 18:56.383
This is gonna be so much fun.

18:56.418 --> 18:58.786
My confidence level
today is way up here.

18:58.820 --> 19:00.788
This is really important
for me to show the judges

19:00.822 --> 19:03.090
that I can not only sculpt,
but I can also paint too.

19:03.124 --> 19:05.292
It's gonna be much better
to lay in your light colors

19:05.326 --> 19:06.493
over the top.

19:06.528 --> 19:08.662
I'm not doing
the traditional green troll.

19:08.696 --> 19:10.030
I want to make it different.

19:10.065 --> 19:12.332
Team Rayce getting
their paint on.

19:15.103 --> 19:17.538
I want to incorporate
a lot of that tan look

19:17.572 --> 19:19.173
that you see in the trees,
and the roots,

19:19.207 --> 19:20.541
and the dark crevices,

19:20.575 --> 19:22.776
and I want him to be able
to camouflage into the setting.

19:29.651 --> 19:31.485
I blended the edges somewhat,

19:31.519 --> 19:33.220
but it's taking forever.

19:33.254 --> 19:35.656
Start painting
in the next half an hour.

19:37.492 --> 19:39.927
I'm sweating bullets,
because I'm so far behind.

19:39.961 --> 19:42.362
So I just start paining
as fast as I can.

19:45.967 --> 19:47.101
Hello!

19:47.135 --> 19:48.107
Hey, hey!

19:48.108 --> 19:50.548
This is amazing.
Here he is, Doug Jones.

19:50.549 --> 19:51.832
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi.

19:52.069 --> 19:54.204
Can we just see what you're
all coming up with today.

19:54.238 --> 19:55.338
He's one of a kind.

19:55.373 --> 19:58.074
He can bring a simple
character to life

19:58.109 --> 19:59.509
in just a matter of movements,

19:59.543 --> 20:01.044
and now he's directing
our models

20:01.078 --> 20:02.712
on how to become our trolls.

20:02.747 --> 20:03.747
It's really an honor.

20:03.781 --> 20:05.782
What happened here?
You poor thing.

20:05.816 --> 20:07.851
He's a prince
that's been cursed.

20:07.885 --> 20:10.887
The live-in stance
would be the regal posture,

20:10.921 --> 20:13.890
but what's gonna sell the shame
might be in the head itself.

20:13.924 --> 20:16.359
Like, if the head
hangs from time to time,

20:16.394 --> 20:18.128
while you're keeping
the proud chest, you know?

20:18.162 --> 20:19.729
Like you're walking
into the court room,

20:19.764 --> 20:21.131
but then you remember,
"Oh, right.

20:21.165 --> 20:23.299
I'm a troll now."

20:23.334 --> 20:25.301
I wouldn't rock so much.

20:25.336 --> 20:27.504
Make your movement
very definite.

20:27.538 --> 20:29.005
You know what I'm saying?
Right?

20:29.040 --> 20:30.807
Argh!
That's what I'm talking about.

20:30.841 --> 20:33.009
If this was a remnant
of my son that I lost,

20:33.044 --> 20:34.978
it would be a clutch
and a love for this.

20:35.012 --> 20:36.713
- That is so cool.
- That is awesome.

20:36.747 --> 20:39.416
- Oh.
- Get fluid in the arms.

20:39.450 --> 20:41.484
That's beautiful.
It's more tree-branchy.

20:41.519 --> 20:44.020
It seems like that might even
be a more jittery motion.

20:44.055 --> 20:45.789
You know, when I did
<i>Pan's Labyrinth,</i> for instance,

20:45.823 --> 20:46.923
the faun was part tree,

20:46.957 --> 20:49.526
so there was a sort
of a ricketiness to him.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.027
So you're gonna help sell this

20:51.062 --> 20:52.896
with that climbing
instinct, right?

20:52.930 --> 20:54.464
Like, if you wanted
to come up like this,

20:54.498 --> 20:57.227
and sort of use the air
as something to climb on...

20:57.298 --> 20:58.803
- Oh, I like that!
- while you're facing us.

20:58.804 --> 21:00.929
My model is practically
screaming.

21:00.930 --> 21:01.899
She's so excited.

21:01.934 --> 21:03.370
It's really nice
having his input.

21:03.404 --> 21:05.906
See? Okay.
You knock 'em alive, okay?

21:05.940 --> 21:08.408
There's many, many combinations
of posture we can do.

21:08.442 --> 21:10.377
You can... We have shoulders,
we have the back,

21:10.411 --> 21:11.845
we have the lower back,
upper back,

21:11.879 --> 21:14.080
we got the neck, neck, neck.

21:14.115 --> 21:18.618
If you're coming out
with a reveal, give us a "Ugh."

21:18.653 --> 21:20.487
You know what I mean? Ugh.

21:20.521 --> 21:22.722
I would be proud
of this for sure, right?

21:22.757 --> 21:25.292
Look at it,
look at us, show it off.

21:25.326 --> 21:27.928
This way, this way, this way,
that way, that way, that way.

21:27.962 --> 21:30.497
And then maybe
back down again, right?

21:30.531 --> 21:31.565
Find the child in you,

21:31.599 --> 21:32.833
'cause you want
to fit in with the kids.

21:32.867 --> 21:34.134
One of these kind of things

21:34.168 --> 21:36.169
is gonna help sell the whole...
Yeah, there you go.

21:36.204 --> 21:37.871
Sassy, sassy, playful, playful.

21:37.905 --> 21:40.574
Whee, whee, whee!

21:40.608 --> 21:42.142
All right everybody,
thank you so much.

21:42.176 --> 21:43.543
- We'll see you soon.
All: - Thank you.

21:43.578 --> 21:44.978
Okay, bye.

21:54.355 --> 21:55.789
Your transitions
are looking good.

21:55.823 --> 21:57.123
- You like it?
- Yeah.

21:57.158 --> 21:59.092
I definitely want to be able
to show that my troll

21:59.126 --> 22:01.728
is changing
into this Helix Bridge,

22:01.762 --> 22:04.264
so I'm using the dark
bluish-grey on the rock side,

22:04.298 --> 22:06.166
and I'm using the lightish grey
on the metal side

22:06.200 --> 22:08.835
to show that he
is genetically altering himself.

22:08.870 --> 22:10.170
Look that way for me.

22:10.204 --> 22:12.939
I take a step back
and look at my paint job,

22:12.974 --> 22:15.175
and I see
the transition happening.

22:15.209 --> 22:16.209
Sick.

22:20.815 --> 22:23.350
For the paint, I want
to make it look like flesh

22:23.384 --> 22:24.918
and match the model's skin.

22:24.952 --> 22:26.686
My troll
is definitely different.

22:26.721 --> 22:28.855
I'm not sure if I went
in the right direction or not,

22:28.890 --> 22:30.957
but I like
what I've created so far.

22:38.199 --> 22:39.666
Everybody, ten minutes!

22:39.700 --> 22:41.368
At the end of the day,
I'm coming in

22:41.402 --> 22:42.836
with my layer of pax...

22:42.870 --> 22:45.739
definitely getting
some really sweet tones...

22:45.773 --> 22:46.740
and then...

22:46.774 --> 22:48.675
It's looking kind of muddy.

22:48.709 --> 22:49.743
Great.

22:49.777 --> 22:52.245
All of the sweet
colors that I chose

22:52.280 --> 22:56.149
bleed into one solid brown mess.

22:56.183 --> 22:58.551
You don't know where
the costume ends and she starts.

22:58.586 --> 23:00.320
Now I have to go
in a completely different

23:00.354 --> 23:01.821
direction with my paint.

23:01.856 --> 23:03.390
- How much do we have?
- Not much time.

23:03.424 --> 23:04.524
Damn it, damn it, damn it.

23:04.558 --> 23:05.992
I am worried for Kelly
on this one,

23:06.027 --> 23:07.928
and I do not want to lose
another person this week.

23:07.962 --> 23:10.330
She still has
a lot of work to do.

23:10.364 --> 23:12.032
That's time, everybody.

23:12.066 --> 23:15.602
Holy crap, I am going to have
to fix this hot mess

23:15.636 --> 23:16.970
in last looks.

23:17.004 --> 23:18.004
I'm screwed.

23:26.558 --> 23:27.524
So it's last looks,

23:27.559 --> 23:28.626
we have one hour left,

23:28.660 --> 23:30.027
and I got to get
those contacts in,

23:30.061 --> 23:31.462
and I have to
finish the paint job,

23:31.496 --> 23:33.764
and it's definitely going
to be eating up my entire hour.

23:35.901 --> 23:36.867
Open your eyes.

23:36.902 --> 23:39.236
I have to finish
painting the face,

23:39.271 --> 23:40.771
finish painting the body,

23:40.805 --> 23:44.475
and I'm just slopping
on color as fast as I can.

23:46.011 --> 23:47.011
Moss everywhere!

23:47.045 --> 23:48.679
I'm grabbing moss

23:48.713 --> 23:51.048
and just throwing it on,
because without the moss,

23:51.082 --> 23:53.684
he doesn't camouflage into the
setting of the Dragon Bridge.

23:53.718 --> 23:55.152
Anything else I'm missing?

23:57.622 --> 23:59.456
I just want to dirty
up her arms,

23:59.491 --> 24:01.292
and make her as nasty
as possible

24:01.326 --> 24:02.693
to change up my colors.

24:02.727 --> 24:03.894
Ten minutes, everybody!

24:12.971 --> 24:14.238
That's time, everybody!

24:15.707 --> 24:18.342
I'm noticing that mine
looks like no one else's.

24:18.376 --> 24:19.576
It's really starting to sink in

24:19.611 --> 24:21.011
that I really
could be going home.

24:32.424 --> 24:35.125
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

24:35.160 --> 24:38.562
Now, as you know, one of you
will be going home tonight,

24:38.596 --> 24:40.197
but before we see
your creations,

24:40.231 --> 24:41.899
let's say hello
to our series judges.

24:41.933 --> 24:42.900
Glenn Hetrick.

24:42.934 --> 24:44.501
- Good evening.
All: - Good evening.

24:44.536 --> 24:45.803
Ve Neill.

24:45.837 --> 24:47.538
- Howdy.
- How are you?

24:47.572 --> 24:49.540
- And Neville Page.
- Hello.

24:49.574 --> 24:50.708
Both: Hello.

24:50.742 --> 24:53.844
And of course,
we have the very special guest

24:53.878 --> 24:55.546
that I mentioned to you
a couple days ago.

24:55.580 --> 24:57.948
He's a fantastically
talented actor

24:57.983 --> 25:01.251
and one of Hollywood's
most in-demand creature actors.

25:01.286 --> 25:03.887
Please welcome
the phenomenal Doug Jones.

25:03.922 --> 25:06.156
Thank you. Hi.

25:07.559 --> 25:09.727
That's a tough intro
to live up to, but thank you.

25:09.761 --> 25:12.134
It's so great
to have you back on this show.

25:12.135 --> 25:13.317
Thank you for being here.

25:13.352 --> 25:14.924
Boy, it's great to be back.
Thank you for having me.

25:14.958 --> 25:16.826
Now, how did your time
go with the models today?

25:16.860 --> 25:18.694
Oh, goodness.
A great time with the models.

25:18.728 --> 25:20.196
It was really exciting to see

25:20.230 --> 25:22.131
the love they have
for putting on these creatures

25:22.165 --> 25:23.699
to make your creations
come to life.

25:23.733 --> 25:25.734
All right, well you
saw the makeups in progress...

25:25.769 --> 25:26.869
I did, I did.

25:26.903 --> 25:28.237
So let's see
how they turned out.

25:49.726 --> 25:52.628
Seeing Megan with
that backdrop makes it work.

25:52.662 --> 25:54.363
I'm proud of what's onstage.

26:11.548 --> 26:14.950
I'm definitely not happy
with how the face turned out,

26:14.985 --> 26:16.752
so I'm just hoping for the best,

26:16.786 --> 26:19.023
and we'll see
what the judges say.

26:37.487 --> 26:40.322
He matches the culture
and the history of Singapore,

26:40.356 --> 26:42.758
and that's what I set out to do,
and that's what I accomplished.

26:58.975 --> 26:59.941
It looks pretty cool.

26:59.976 --> 27:01.243
The silhouette's there...

27:01.277 --> 27:02.411
I'm happy with it.

27:20.396 --> 27:21.963
It's a little bit rough,

27:21.998 --> 27:24.299
but I did execute the vision.

27:24.333 --> 27:26.702
I'm at least proud that I was
able to get this much work done.

27:44.353 --> 27:46.121
Mine looks like no one else's.

27:46.155 --> 27:48.023
I really thought
outside the box,

27:48.057 --> 27:50.325
and I'm just hoping that the
judges are with me on this one.

28:07.076 --> 28:08.910
I'm not 100% happy
with the sculpt,

28:08.945 --> 28:11.046
but I'm really happy
with the paint job.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.481
I think he's really
looking good.

28:29.632 --> 28:33.590
Doug Jones brought my character
to a whole other level.

28:33.624 --> 28:35.759
She looks creepy, crawly,

28:35.793 --> 28:38.228
and I love it.

28:54.812 --> 28:56.313
I don't know where I stand,

28:56.347 --> 28:58.648
because mine doesn't look
anything like anybody else's.

28:58.683 --> 29:00.717
I could either be on top,

29:00.751 --> 29:01.918
or I could be on the bottom.

29:19.570 --> 29:22.439
I feel like my model could be
moving a little bit more,

29:22.473 --> 29:23.540
but I really like her.

29:23.574 --> 29:25.575
I think she could be a top look.

29:43.312 --> 29:45.112
I think it looks fantastic.

29:45.147 --> 29:46.781
She sells it very well,

29:46.815 --> 29:49.383
and I'm totally sold
on my own character.

29:49.418 --> 29:50.851
I'm sorry, I love it.

29:55.324 --> 29:57.491
Okay, judges,
it's time for a closer look.

30:03.398 --> 30:05.633
There's these hard edges
that don't even, shape-wise,

30:05.667 --> 30:08.002
go into the anatomy;
That's a big problem.

30:08.036 --> 30:11.205
It's also not sculpted
literal enough to tell us

30:11.239 --> 30:12.440
that it is rock.

30:12.474 --> 30:13.808
Yeah, I think you're right.

30:16.445 --> 30:18.179
Can you turn to the side?

30:18.213 --> 30:20.781
It's the round, spherical shape
that I struggle with,

30:20.816 --> 30:23.484
and I'm not sure
how that communicates troll.

30:23.518 --> 30:24.652
Yeah.

30:24.686 --> 30:26.487
I have no idea what
the judges are thinking.

30:26.521 --> 30:28.422
I know the sculpts
don't look good,

30:28.457 --> 30:31.192
but I hope they
don't hate them too much,

30:31.226 --> 30:32.426
because I don't want to go home.

30:34.930 --> 30:37.498
Tell us who made your favorite
fantasy troll tonight

30:37.532 --> 30:39.734
on Twitter, using #FaceOff.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.901
I'm not sure
how that spherical shape

30:44.935 --> 30:46.652
communicates troll.

30:46.653 --> 30:48.648
I'm just not a fan of
the sculpts that I did,

30:48.724 --> 30:50.480
and that makes me
a little bit worried.

30:50.514 --> 30:53.015
My favorite part about
this whole makeup is the color.

30:53.050 --> 30:54.984
- I agree.
- Good job selling it.

30:56.687 --> 30:58.488
I just don't even understand
what's going on.

30:58.522 --> 30:59.856
It's morphing.

30:59.890 --> 31:02.458
But there's no line
of demarcation with colors;

31:02.493 --> 31:04.227
You can't tell
that it's morphing.

31:04.261 --> 31:05.528
Yeah, it's pretty rough.

31:06.830 --> 31:08.598
I think it's
a gorgeous sculpture.

31:08.632 --> 31:10.833
It looks like a caricature
drawing to me.

31:10.868 --> 31:12.201
From the boardwalk, yeah.

31:12.236 --> 31:14.937
- Yeah, from the boardwalk.
- Totally, totally, yeah.

31:14.972 --> 31:16.439
There's some really rough forms

31:16.473 --> 31:18.441
covered by some
really good paint.

31:18.475 --> 31:22.345
And that head shape
is not even remotely troll-like.

31:23.547 --> 31:26.082
There's some
really beautiful color.

31:26.116 --> 31:28.451
Lovely job.

31:30.120 --> 31:33.623
I love this hybrid of, like,
woodsy-barky-dragony together.

31:33.657 --> 31:34.657
Love that chest.

31:34.691 --> 31:35.725
It's beautiful.

31:37.561 --> 31:38.561
To the right, please.

31:40.364 --> 31:42.765
It doesn't seem appropriate
for a troll to me.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.435
It's very bizarre
that this is so bright red.

31:45.469 --> 31:46.803
Thank you.
It's great.

31:50.574 --> 31:52.909
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations.

31:52.943 --> 31:54.706
Let's find out
what they thought.

31:54.740 --> 31:56.808
Adam,

31:56.842 --> 31:58.409
Darla,

31:58.444 --> 32:00.545
Stephanie,

32:00.579 --> 32:02.547
Logan,

32:02.581 --> 32:05.383
Julian,

32:05.417 --> 32:08.252
you are all safe and can head
back to the makeup room.

32:08.287 --> 32:09.320
Nice work this week.

32:09.355 --> 32:10.421
Thanks.

32:12.825 --> 32:13.825
Good job.

32:14.893 --> 32:15.893
Now the rest of you

32:15.928 --> 32:18.396
were the best
and the worst this week,

32:18.430 --> 32:20.631
and the judges would like
to speak with each of you

32:20.666 --> 32:21.799
to learn more about your work.

32:21.834 --> 32:24.068
Kelly, could you please step up?

32:30.342 --> 32:33.044
Explain how your bridge
inspired your design this week.

32:33.078 --> 32:34.679
Her child
was working on the bridge,

32:34.713 --> 32:39.517
and he falls to his death,
and it drove her completely mad,

32:39.551 --> 32:42.120
and so she's just
forever cursing this bridge.

32:42.154 --> 32:44.355
I think you did
an astounding job.

32:44.390 --> 32:46.224
Thank you.

32:46.258 --> 32:49.427
You've made proficient use
of your model's features.

32:49.461 --> 32:51.129
I really like
what you did this week.

32:51.163 --> 32:52.530
Thank you so much.

32:52.564 --> 32:53.831
It's very monotone,

32:53.866 --> 32:56.267
which is absolutely okay,
because she just seems

32:56.301 --> 32:58.469
like she's become
at one with this bridge.

32:58.504 --> 33:00.905
- Nice job.
- Thank you so much.

33:00.939 --> 33:02.940
It doesn't feel troll-like,

33:02.975 --> 33:07.078
but I do like how you've
completed this as a character.

33:07.112 --> 33:09.280
- It's pretty solid.
- Thank you.

33:09.314 --> 33:12.049
Nayeli, your performance
is absolutely perfect.

33:12.084 --> 33:14.452
- Beautiful job, both of you.
- Thank you.

33:14.486 --> 33:16.020
Kelly,
if you'd please step back.

33:21.727 --> 33:23.060
- Good job, Kelly.
- Thank you.

33:23.095 --> 33:24.962
Anthony.

33:30.536 --> 33:33.571
Tell me how the Helix Bridge
inspired your character.

33:33.605 --> 33:37.341
My character was a troll who
used to live in the rainforest,

33:37.376 --> 33:41.012
but he fell asleep, and woke up
in this crazy modern society,

33:41.046 --> 33:43.648
so he started to genetically
alter his features

33:43.682 --> 33:45.383
in order to hide
under the new bridge.

33:45.417 --> 33:48.453
This guy doesn't look like he
belongs with that bridge at all.

33:50.489 --> 33:55.059
I couldn't figure out if he was
supposed to be metal or rock.

33:55.093 --> 33:57.462
- I just don't get it.
- Okay.

33:57.496 --> 33:59.964
This transition
is the biggest problem.

33:59.998 --> 34:02.300
It's just all one grey
textural thing.

34:03.869 --> 34:06.871
I see a little bit
of confusion in the sculpt,

34:06.905 --> 34:09.273
and I think it's
because of a lack

34:09.308 --> 34:11.409
of a clearly-identified
goal for yourself.

34:12.478 --> 34:14.378
Anthony, please step down.

34:19.985 --> 34:21.686
All right, let's talk to Ben.

34:27.426 --> 34:30.594
Tell us how your bridge
inspired this troll.

34:30.629 --> 34:31.728
During the summertime,

34:31.763 --> 34:33.563
kids will actually come
and play on the bridge.

34:33.599 --> 34:35.065
She's a fun troll,

34:35.100 --> 34:37.467
and I wanted to do something
a little more fun and whimsical.

34:37.503 --> 34:40.071
Excellent, 'cause
that's why I love this.

34:40.105 --> 34:41.072
Thank you.

34:41.106 --> 34:42.773
I really applaud

34:42.808 --> 34:45.943
the courage to do something
that may not work.

34:45.978 --> 34:47.879
Love it, and I love
how you're thinking.

34:47.913 --> 34:49.179
Thank you.

34:49.214 --> 34:51.282
I love the whimsy,
I love the laughter of it all,

34:51.315 --> 34:52.717
and Alexandria,

34:52.751 --> 34:55.553
you have brought such playful,
childlike attitude to this.

34:55.587 --> 34:58.656
As an actor, I would love
to work on film with you.

34:58.690 --> 35:00.992
I think it's the best work
I've seen you do.

35:01.026 --> 35:04.088
Super strong decisions
in terms of detail.

35:04.089 --> 35:06.150
Everything on that face
is working for me.

35:06.159 --> 35:07.259
Thank you.

35:07.294 --> 35:08.861
Ben, please step back.

35:13.934 --> 35:15.401
Emily, please come forward.

35:21.875 --> 35:23.509
Talk to me
about the Golden Gate Bridge

35:23.543 --> 35:25.244
influencing this troll.

35:25.278 --> 35:27.813
The story is that she
jumped off the bridge,

35:27.847 --> 35:30.482
and her body washed ashore
to one of the little islands,

35:30.517 --> 35:33.819
and she transformed
into that rock texture.

35:33.853 --> 35:37.556
I would rather not see the
skin-to-prosthetic transitions,

35:37.591 --> 35:39.258
but the paint job
I think is gorgeous.

35:39.292 --> 35:41.260
Your choice of colors
and complimentary colors

35:41.294 --> 35:42.895
is beautiful.

35:42.929 --> 35:45.598
I get that you
took huge risks this week,

35:45.632 --> 35:47.132
but they didn't pay off.

35:47.167 --> 35:50.536
I'm bumping on the abrupt
transitions really hard.

35:51.871 --> 35:53.906
This doesn't fit
into the troll thing for me.

35:53.940 --> 35:55.374
It's a beautiful character,

35:55.408 --> 35:58.677
it's just not a beautiful
character for this challenge.

35:58.712 --> 36:00.012
I agree.

36:00.046 --> 36:01.614
Emily, you can head back.

36:07.387 --> 36:09.254
Rob, please step up.

36:15.061 --> 36:17.696
Please give us the backstory
to your bridge-inspired troll.

36:17.731 --> 36:20.199
This is a prince that fell
in love with a princess,

36:20.233 --> 36:23.235
but her father didn't like the
courtship that they were having,

36:23.269 --> 36:24.570
so he put a curse on him.

36:24.604 --> 36:28.440
The underlying form
is extraordinarily flawed.

36:30.910 --> 36:32.911
I actually love your paint job,

36:32.946 --> 36:35.047
but unfortunately,
there's not a whole lot

36:35.081 --> 36:37.850
happening here anatomically
to tell me it's a troll,

36:37.884 --> 36:39.018
or more importantly,

36:39.052 --> 36:43.822
to communicate
a successful makeup effect.

36:43.857 --> 36:45.324
It looks like a pullover mask.

36:45.358 --> 36:47.226
It's got too much
going on back here,

36:47.260 --> 36:49.028
when it should've been
going on up here.

36:49.062 --> 36:50.796
It just missed for me
this week, Rob.

36:50.797 --> 36:51.797
Okay.

36:52.265 --> 36:54.199
Rob, please step down.

37:00.573 --> 37:01.840
Jamie, please come forward.

37:08.481 --> 37:12.418
Tell us how the Dragon Bridge
in Bali inspired your character.

37:12.452 --> 37:14.720
There are statues
of good and evil

37:14.754 --> 37:16.588
that protect the bridge.

37:16.623 --> 37:19.391
This is actually the protector
of those guardians.

37:19.426 --> 37:21.060
I think it's really well done.

37:22.662 --> 37:25.064
Your paint job
is really beautiful.

37:25.098 --> 37:26.465
Thank you.

37:26.499 --> 37:29.068
I think that you've achieved
a plausible wood sculpt,

37:29.102 --> 37:30.536
and that's not easy to do.

37:30.570 --> 37:31.970
Thank you.

37:32.005 --> 37:34.339
This is something I would be
proud to wear, myself, on film.

37:34.374 --> 37:36.642
The sculpt is
so incredibly detailed

37:36.676 --> 37:38.310
and gorgeous to look at.

37:38.344 --> 37:39.812
You did a great job.
Beautiful.

37:39.846 --> 37:41.280
Thank you.

37:41.314 --> 37:43.115
Jamie, please step back.

37:48.822 --> 37:50.456
All right, coaches,
do you have anything

37:50.490 --> 37:52.591
to say to the judges before
they make their decisions?

37:52.625 --> 37:55.327
I apologize, guys...
Anthony and Rob.

37:55.361 --> 37:58.030
I told my team the last thing
that I wanted them to do

37:58.064 --> 37:59.565
is go in the direction
of the big noses

37:59.599 --> 38:01.900
and the big chins,
so I'm realizing now

38:01.935 --> 38:03.469
that that was the wrong route.

38:03.503 --> 38:06.772
A lot of those choices
were from my pushing.

38:06.806 --> 38:07.773
Okay.

38:07.807 --> 38:09.007
Please head back
to the makeup room

38:09.042 --> 38:10.209
while the judges deliberate.

38:15.782 --> 38:17.182
All right, judges,
why don't we talk

38:17.217 --> 38:18.584
about your favorites this week?

38:18.618 --> 38:20.519
- Let's start with Kelly.
- I love the pallet.

38:20.553 --> 38:22.221
It had that real
washed-out look.

38:22.255 --> 38:23.489
It was fabulous.

38:23.523 --> 38:25.257
To pay that much
attention, head to toe,

38:25.291 --> 38:26.391
I'm a big fan of hers.

38:26.426 --> 38:27.893
All right, let's move on to Ben.

38:27.927 --> 38:29.128
I loved the whimsy.

38:29.162 --> 38:30.829
I love that she wants
to fit in with the kids.

38:30.864 --> 38:32.765
Creating those big,
fantastical proportions

38:32.799 --> 38:35.467
and making them work
is extremely difficult.

38:35.502 --> 38:36.802
Okay, what about Jamie?

38:36.836 --> 38:40.506
She did an amazing job
bringing in the surroundings.

38:40.540 --> 38:43.008
Beautiful paint job.
I loved the makeup.

38:43.042 --> 38:45.944
Also the decision
to use a wood-carved sculpture.

38:45.979 --> 38:48.046
Huge risk, great reward.

38:48.081 --> 38:49.715
All right,
so let's move on to the makeups

38:49.749 --> 38:51.083
that didn't work for you.

38:51.117 --> 38:52.551
Let's start with Anthony.

38:52.585 --> 38:54.987
I think the paint job
is what was lacking for me.

38:55.021 --> 38:56.455
If he would've
changed the color,

38:56.489 --> 38:58.924
you would have realized it was
some sort of a transformation.

38:58.958 --> 39:00.926
All right,
let's move on to Emily.

39:00.960 --> 39:03.796
Hard ledges
that don't fit the anatomy,

39:03.830 --> 39:06.131
and they have no blending edge
on them whatsoever.

39:06.166 --> 39:08.834
There's no evidence
visually of troll.

39:08.868 --> 39:09.935
- None.
- None.

39:09.969 --> 39:12.004
All right, let's move on to Rob.

39:12.038 --> 39:16.141
The thing I struggled the most
with was the overall form,

39:16.176 --> 39:17.876
in side view in particular.

39:17.911 --> 39:20.212
Rayce really did trip him up.

39:20.246 --> 39:21.847
It looked too masky for me,

39:21.881 --> 39:22.948
like it was slipped over,

39:22.982 --> 39:24.983
and painted some dark eyes
on it, you know?

39:25.018 --> 39:26.852
All right judges,
have you made up your minds?

39:26.886 --> 39:28.086
- We have.
- Okay.

39:28.121 --> 39:29.121
Let's bring 'em back out.

39:37.897 --> 39:40.299
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the top looks.

39:40.333 --> 39:41.967
Kelly,

39:42.001 --> 39:44.169
I thought you did
a really convincing job

39:44.204 --> 39:45.804
with your painting,
and your character

39:45.839 --> 39:48.607
as a whole was
creepy and compelling.

39:48.641 --> 39:49.942
Ben,

39:49.976 --> 39:51.376
what a bold choice,

39:51.411 --> 39:54.046
to fully embrace the fantasy
aspect of this challenge

39:54.080 --> 39:57.115
in such an exaggerated
and fun way.

39:57.150 --> 39:58.483
And Jamie,

39:58.518 --> 40:01.053
we love the wood texture
of your character.

40:01.087 --> 40:04.089
We also thought you did a great
job embracing the culture

40:04.123 --> 40:05.557
and the history of your bridge.

40:05.592 --> 40:08.126
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

40:08.161 --> 40:09.628
The winner
of this challenge is...

40:16.999 --> 40:19.134
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

40:19.168 --> 40:20.602
The winner
of this challenge is...

40:24.474 --> 40:25.474
Jamie.

40:27.743 --> 40:30.112
This was hands-down

40:30.146 --> 40:31.379
your best work so far.

40:31.414 --> 40:33.315
Whatever you did
to find your focus

40:33.349 --> 40:34.816
and put your best foot forward,

40:34.851 --> 40:35.951
you must keep it up.

40:35.985 --> 40:36.952
Okay.

40:36.986 --> 40:38.253
To be on top and to win,

40:38.287 --> 40:39.788
it's a great feeling,

40:39.822 --> 40:41.423
but at the same time,
it's humbling,

40:41.457 --> 40:42.924
because I need to work harder,

40:42.959 --> 40:44.259
and keep that up.

40:44.293 --> 40:46.661
There's just one more
congratulations that we owe,

40:46.696 --> 40:48.497
and that is to you, Anthony.

40:48.531 --> 40:51.967
All three of the top looks
tonight were from your team.

40:52.001 --> 40:54.035
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

40:54.070 --> 40:55.337
All right, Jamie.

40:55.371 --> 40:56.471
You, Kelly, and Ben

40:56.506 --> 40:57.973
can all head back
to the makeup room,

40:58.007 --> 40:59.107
along with the coaches.

40:59.142 --> 41:00.375
Thanks, guys.

41:07.250 --> 41:09.484
The rest of you
are on the bottom this week,

41:09.519 --> 41:10.852
and one of you
will be going home.

41:12.021 --> 41:13.188
Please step forward.

41:20.429 --> 41:22.831
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

41:22.865 --> 41:24.866
Anthony, we thought
that there was some nice

41:24.901 --> 41:26.101
sculpting moments in your work,

41:26.135 --> 41:28.136
but your vision
was not communicated

41:28.171 --> 41:29.571
in the final character.

41:29.605 --> 41:32.174
Emily, we appreciate
your creative thinking,

41:32.208 --> 41:33.675
but this one got away from you,

41:33.709 --> 41:35.877
and the troll aspect
of the challenge

41:35.912 --> 41:37.512
was lost in the mix.

41:37.547 --> 41:40.916
Rob, your paint choices
and your techniques were good,

41:40.950 --> 41:43.718
but your makeup suffered
from anatomical flaws

41:43.753 --> 41:46.054
that rendered it
more alien than troll.

41:46.088 --> 41:47.756
So who is going home tonight?

41:47.790 --> 41:49.925
The person going
home tonight is...

41:53.896 --> 41:55.096
Anthony.

41:56.564 --> 41:59.131
Unfortunately, the visual
language of your character

41:59.183 --> 42:01.884
was indiscernible as troll.

42:01.936 --> 42:03.769
Anthony, I'm so sorry,

42:03.805 --> 42:05.704
but you have been eliminated.

42:05.740 --> 42:08.190
Emily and Rob,
you are both safe this week.

42:08.242 --> 42:09.909
You can head back
to the makeup room.

42:13.865 --> 42:16.549
We've been so impressed
with your passion for makeup,

42:16.584 --> 42:18.167
and we understand
that you really

42:18.219 --> 42:19.752
belong doing this for a living.

42:19.804 --> 42:22.354
This is just the first
step on that journey.

42:22.390 --> 42:24.790
It's just been an absolutely
amazing experience.

42:24.842 --> 42:26.325
Thank you.

42:26.360 --> 42:28.861
Anthony, it's really been
great having you here with us,

42:28.913 --> 42:31.030
but if you would please head
back to the makeup room

42:31.065 --> 42:32.798
and pack up your kit.

42:32.800 --> 42:33.799
Thank you.

42:33.835 --> 42:35.417
- Good luck.
- Good luck, babe.

42:35.453 --> 42:38.654
This experience has been
absolutely life-changing for me.

42:40.424 --> 42:41.841
It's me.

42:44.111 --> 42:45.478
This is just the beginning,

42:45.530 --> 42:47.146
and I've grown so much.

42:47.181 --> 42:49.014
I'm now a better person,

42:49.050 --> 42:51.517
and I'm more confident
in my abilities.

42:51.519 --> 42:52.852
The world is open to me,

42:52.854 --> 42:55.387
and I can't wait
for what's next.
