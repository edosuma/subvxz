00:13.046 --> 00:14.747
[narrator] <i>A gruesome discovery.</i>

00:14.848 --> 00:16.415
[woman over phone]

00:19.586 --> 00:21.587
It's horrific,
and it's disturbing.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.656
[narrator]<i> Two mysteries</i>
<i>that must be solved.</i>

00:24.758 --> 00:26.792
Who did it
and who is our victim?

00:27.827 --> 00:29.561
We knew right from the beginning

00:29.662 --> 00:32.031
that this was going
to be extremely difficult.

00:32.132 --> 00:33.465
Oh, my God.

00:33.566 --> 00:36.635
[narrator]<i> Until a trail of
terrifying surveillance video...</i>

00:36.736 --> 00:37.770
What is that?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.938
I was hoping that it captured
what had happened.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.775
[narrator]<i> ...has the
potential to reveal the truth.</i>

00:42.876 --> 00:45.711
This is probably the most
important piece of evidence we have.

00:45.812 --> 00:46.745
This gives me an idea.

00:46.846 --> 00:48.781
[narrator]<i> And catch</i>
<i>a brutal killer...</i>

00:52.218 --> 00:53.852
<i>...before they strike again.</i>

00:53.953 --> 00:56.722
<i>We knew that this was
a dangerous person.</i>

00:56.823 --> 00:58.791
And we needed to find them
as soon as we could.

[narrator]<i> Pierce County</i>
<i>officers raced to the scene.</i>

02:12.165 --> 02:14.933
I'm processing
what the dispatch had told me

02:15.034 --> 02:17.202
and trying to think ahead,

02:17.303 --> 02:18.804
<i>trying to come up with a plan.</i>

02:20.440 --> 02:22.374
<i>It was not on a main arterial.</i>

02:22.475 --> 02:25.744
<i>It was a bit secluded,
a rural area,</i>

02:25.845 --> 02:27.212
<i>not really populated.</i>

02:33.119 --> 02:34.119
<i>I approached the body.</i>

02:36.489 --> 02:39.992
It appeared to be a female,
light-skinned African American.

02:41.227 --> 02:43.228
It appeared that her clothing

02:43.329 --> 02:47.299
was burned and melted
in attempt to set her on fire.

02:50.303 --> 02:53.672
Our victim had a quilted
fabric over her face,

02:53.773 --> 02:56.508
so we really couldn't
identify her easily.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.347
<i>I could see trauma to the neck,</i>

03:02.448 --> 03:04.016
<i>looked like there were
stab wounds</i>

03:04.117 --> 03:05.384
on the left side of the neck.

03:05.485 --> 03:08.320
And there was also some maybe
blunt force trauma to the head.

03:10.757 --> 03:14.693
Our victim didn't have
any identifying documentation.

03:14.794 --> 03:16.695
No wallet. They didn't have
a cell phone.

03:16.796 --> 03:19.531
<i>They didn't have
a driver's license.</i>

03:19.632 --> 03:22.568
<i>It's so important to identify
our victims as soon as we can,</i>

03:22.669 --> 03:25.704
because most often
homicide victims

03:25.805 --> 03:27.005
are by someone that they know.

03:29.576 --> 03:30.876
[Det. Kevin Johnson]<i> One</i>
<i>of the initial things</i>

03:30.977 --> 03:35.681
that were able to do
was to, um, try and match

03:35.782 --> 03:38.083
the description of the body
that we're looking at

03:38.184 --> 03:40.452
<i>up with any missing people
that have been reported.</i>

03:40.553 --> 03:42.454
Can you run a missing persons
check for me?

03:42.555 --> 03:43.922
We knew right from the beginning

03:44.023 --> 03:47.059
that this was going
to be extremely difficult

03:47.160 --> 03:49.261
<i>without even knowing
who the victim was.</i>

03:50.096 --> 03:50.963
Nothing?

03:52.165 --> 03:52.965
All right.

03:56.269 --> 03:59.938
The fire appeared to have been
intentionally set

04:00.039 --> 04:02.241
in an effort
to conceal the body.

04:03.443 --> 04:07.079
My impression was that
an accelerant was used,

04:07.180 --> 04:10.749
and it probably only burned
for the life of the accelerant,

04:10.850 --> 04:12.851
which means the body
didn't actually burn,

04:12.952 --> 04:13.819
only the clothing.

04:15.622 --> 04:19.258
We were looking for items

04:19.359 --> 04:21.760
<i>that may have been strewn
along the road.</i>

04:23.229 --> 04:26.665
There was a broken
kind of clear green,

04:26.766 --> 04:28.634
uh, cigarette lighter
on the ground.

04:30.670 --> 04:32.070
I focused in
on the lighter, obviously,

04:32.171 --> 04:33.038
because it appeared the body

04:33.139 --> 04:35.240
had been burned
and accelerants used.

04:35.341 --> 04:37.376
And if our suspect used
that lighter,

04:37.477 --> 04:39.945
it's quite possible that
their DNA would be on that.

04:47.820 --> 04:48.854
Hello, ma'am.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.355
I'd like to ask you
a couple questions.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.791
The 911 caller told me
that she went

04:52.892 --> 04:55.327
to her friend's house.
As she drove down the road,

04:55.428 --> 04:57.529
she didn't notice
anything unusual.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.065
<i>She left that friend's house
about two hours later,</i>

05:01.634 --> 05:03.368
<i>and as she approached
the intersection,</i>

05:03.469 --> 05:06.204
<i>she thought what she saw
was maybe a tree.</i>

05:06.306 --> 05:07.973
<i>She hit the high beams
on her car</i>

05:08.074 --> 05:09.574
so that she could see it better,

05:09.676 --> 05:11.543
and she saw what she thought
was an arm.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.580
<i>She was afraid to approach it.</i>

05:16.215 --> 05:17.316
<i>She drove home.</i>

05:17.417 --> 05:19.051
She then returned
with her boyfriend.

05:22.455 --> 05:26.058
<i>And they both confirmed then
that it was a body.</i>

05:26.159 --> 05:29.328
[Johnson]<i> We were fairly
confident after speaking with her,</i>

05:29.429 --> 05:31.129
the body had been dumped

05:31.230 --> 05:32.931
somewhere between the hours

05:33.032 --> 05:35.067
of 1:00 and 3:30 in the morning.

05:36.536 --> 05:38.403
[Laliberte]<i> It's odd that</i>
<i>a body would be dumped</i>

05:38.504 --> 05:39.738
in the middle of a roadway
like that.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.974
Um, you know, typically, people
try to hide a homicide victim.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.476
<i>And this wasn't the case,</i>

05:44.577 --> 05:48.613
so to me it spoke
that they were in a hurry.

05:48.715 --> 05:51.683
They weren't concerned
with where they put it.

05:51.784 --> 05:53.852
They just wanna get rid of it.

05:53.953 --> 05:56.955
[narrator]<i> A neighborhood
canvass immediately gets underway.</i>

05:59.759 --> 06:01.159
We knock on doors.

06:01.260 --> 06:03.028
Anyone that could
have information.

06:03.129 --> 06:04.696
We try to, you know,
see what they know

06:04.797 --> 06:07.165
<i>and if they can help us out.</i>

06:07.266 --> 06:09.668
<i>I'll ask, "Is there anything
unusual or different</i>

06:09.769 --> 06:12.571
than what normally happens
in the neighborhood?

06:12.638 --> 06:14.573
Did you see any people
that don't belong?"

06:16.242 --> 06:18.143
<i>It was kind of a smaller
little neighborhood,</i>

06:18.244 --> 06:19.978
<i>so we were able
to pretty much knock</i>

06:20.079 --> 06:22.114
on all of the houses
that were nearby.

06:23.549 --> 06:24.383
Hi.

06:29.422 --> 06:32.424
Some of our deputies
that work up in that area

06:32.525 --> 06:35.827
were familiar with,
you know, a squatters' house.

06:35.928 --> 06:37.829
<i>It was not uncommon
for cars to be coming</i>

06:37.930 --> 06:39.731
out of that house
at all hours at night,

06:39.832 --> 06:42.868
so we were not sure
if that house had anything

06:42.969 --> 06:46.004
<i>to do with this body or not.</i>

06:46.105 --> 06:49.241
The squatters all gave an
account of what they had been up to,

06:49.342 --> 06:53.412
and there wasn't any reason to
believe that they were involved.

06:53.513 --> 06:55.781
[Johnson]<i> One of the main
things that we're looking for</i>

06:55.882 --> 06:57.082
<i>when canvassing neighborhoods</i>

06:57.183 --> 06:59.117
<i>is to see if any
of the neighbors have cameras</i>

06:59.218 --> 07:00.385
that might have
captured anything.

07:04.023 --> 07:05.857
[Laliberte] <i>One of my detectives
came up to me and said</i>

07:05.958 --> 07:07.526
<i>that he saw
a surveillance camera</i>

07:07.627 --> 07:09.394
on the corner of a house

07:09.495 --> 07:11.663
which was also at the corner
of the intersection.

07:16.702 --> 07:18.203
I think we can get
some footage from that.

07:18.304 --> 07:19.971
The camera pointed at the street

07:20.072 --> 07:22.607
where the body
was first discovered.

07:24.043 --> 07:25.777
<i>We were really hopeful
that this was gonna</i>

07:25.878 --> 07:28.647
give us something
that we could work with.

07:28.748 --> 07:30.982
[narrator]<i> Investigators</i>
<i>download the footage</i>

07:31.083 --> 07:33.452
<i>and take it back
to the department to view.</i>

07:35.054 --> 07:36.822
[Laliberte]<i> Maybe we can</i>
<i>capture a vehicle.</i>

07:36.923 --> 07:39.324
Maybe we can see
the victim alive.

07:39.425 --> 07:41.426
Maybe we can capture the suspect

07:41.527 --> 07:45.664
and we can figure out
exactly how this happened.

07:45.765 --> 07:47.332
[Johnson]<i> The 911 caller</i>
<i>was able to give us</i>

07:47.433 --> 07:49.568
some kind of a time frame
to go on.

07:49.669 --> 07:51.803
Take it to start after 1:00 a.m.

08:06.786 --> 08:10.789
We were really hoping
to see who dumped the body.

08:10.890 --> 08:13.558
[Laliberte]<i> My concern with the video
was that it was partially obstructed</i>

08:13.659 --> 08:15.961
<i>both by a carport roof</i>

08:16.062 --> 08:18.697
and trees and foliage
in the area.

08:18.798 --> 08:21.533
So it wasn't the best shot,
but it was all we had at the time.

08:24.237 --> 08:27.005
<i>There weren't any street
lights to illuminate that area,</i>

08:27.106 --> 08:30.175
and it appeared that infrared
was the only light source

08:30.276 --> 08:31.309
for that surveillance camera.

08:47.927 --> 08:48.627
Stop it there.

08:49.629 --> 08:50.529
Play that again.

08:59.171 --> 09:03.975
Around 1:27 a.m., we see
headlights approach,

09:04.076 --> 09:06.144
<i>and it appeared
to be a pickup truck</i>

09:06.245 --> 09:08.847
<i>speeding down the roadway
where we found our victim.</i>

09:10.283 --> 09:11.950
All we can tell
is that it's dark color.

09:14.253 --> 09:16.221
The video quality
wasn't good enough

09:16.322 --> 09:18.557
to be able to read
a license plate.

09:18.658 --> 09:19.524
Let it play.

09:34.774 --> 09:38.376
A small dark sedan
follows after the pickup

09:38.477 --> 09:41.079
<i>and enters the intersection
where we found the body.</i>

09:41.180 --> 09:44.983
[Johnson]<i> It appears to stop right
where the body was discovered.</i>

09:45.084 --> 09:48.086
<i>It's in the timeframe that we
were given by the 911 caller.</i>

09:57.597 --> 10:00.265
You then see headlights
coming back from down the road

10:00.366 --> 10:02.067
toward the intersection
and toward

10:02.168 --> 10:03.501
where the sedan is parked.

10:06.405 --> 10:07.606
<i>At that point we're thinking,</i>

10:07.707 --> 10:10.508
that there are clearly
two people involved in this.

10:11.377 --> 10:12.877
They appear to be together.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.517
Zoom in.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.322
We can't see anybody.

10:24.423 --> 10:25.557
We can't see what they're doing.

10:29.829 --> 10:30.962
Okay, let it play.

10:33.666 --> 10:36.201
[narrator]<i> One of the vehicles</i>
<i>then leaves.</i>

10:40.139 --> 10:42.207
Freeze it there.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.810
[narrator]<i> It's the same pickup
that passed by minutes earlier.</i>

10:47.980 --> 10:52.217
[Johnson]<i> It appears that it probably
had to go down the road and turn around</i>

10:52.318 --> 10:55.320
and then come back before
stopping next to the car.

11:00.192 --> 11:03.328
The dark pickup truck
leaves the direction

11:03.429 --> 11:04.796
that it originally came from.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.733
<i>The car stays there for a while.</i>

11:41.567 --> 11:42.367
Play, play it again.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.043
Zoom in.

11:57.983 --> 12:00.985
As the dark sedan
started to make a turn

12:01.087 --> 12:03.421
to go back out the way
it came in.

12:06.292 --> 12:08.727
<i>I could see a reflection
in the side of the door.</i>

12:15.034 --> 12:17.402
See if it's there
when the pickup leaves.

12:17.503 --> 12:20.805
[narrator]<i> Detectives compare
footage of the two vehicles leaving.</i>

12:32.251 --> 12:33.051
Nothing.

12:37.356 --> 12:39.190
[narrator]<i> They focus again</i>
<i>on the sedan.</i>

12:40.693 --> 12:43.194
We had to watch it several
times because it's not very clear.

12:43.295 --> 12:45.964
<i>We see what appears to be</i>

12:46.065 --> 12:48.800
the flickering of some light
in the roadway.

12:48.901 --> 12:51.402
[Laliberte]<i> The lighting</i>
<i>was very dim in that area,</i>

12:51.504 --> 12:53.705
but that was,
it was pretty apparent

12:53.806 --> 12:55.774
that that was flame
that we were looking at.

13:02.047 --> 13:04.482
And that confirmed for us
that, in fact,

13:04.583 --> 13:06.117
that the body was on fire.

13:10.156 --> 13:12.557
It's horrific
and it's disturbing,

13:12.658 --> 13:15.660
but it is almost
something else to realize

13:15.761 --> 13:17.128
<i>that you're watching that...</i>

13:18.697 --> 13:21.299
<i>You realize that that's
happening to a human being.</i>

13:25.905 --> 13:28.473
[narrator]<i> The footage proves</i>
<i>the body was set on fire</i>

13:28.574 --> 13:30.308
<i>by the suspect in the sedan.</i>

13:30.409 --> 13:32.710
[Laliberte]<i> We weren't able</i>
<i>to see any license plates,</i>

13:32.812 --> 13:34.345
<i>but at least we had
a starting point.</i>

13:34.446 --> 13:37.415
<i>We had a timeline, and we knew
that we were looking for</i>

13:37.516 --> 13:39.818
at least a pickup truck
and a small sedan,

13:39.919 --> 13:42.520
and that's better than we had
three hours prior to that.

13:45.124 --> 13:48.193
<i>My plan was to put out
a bulletin to law enforcement</i>

13:48.294 --> 13:50.995
and ask if anybody has any
information on one of these vehicles.

13:52.898 --> 13:56.568
[narrator]<i> Meanwhile, officers
canvass for any other cameras</i>

13:56.669 --> 13:59.103
<i>that may have captured
the vehicles.</i>

13:59.205 --> 14:02.473
There was a fairly busy
intersection nearby,

14:02.575 --> 14:05.710
which had a convenience store,
a church on one corner,

14:05.811 --> 14:08.780
and also a marine shop,
or a boat and sails outfit

14:08.881 --> 14:10.315
<i>right there on the corner.</i>

14:10.416 --> 14:12.483
[narrator]<i> Above the door</i>
<i>of the marine shop,</i>

14:12.585 --> 14:15.420
<i>is a camera that points
at the intersection.</i>

14:17.256 --> 14:19.390
[Laliberte]<i> I was hoping that</i>
<i>we could get a clear video</i>

14:19.491 --> 14:21.459
<i>so that maybe we can
identify the vehicles.</i>

14:21.560 --> 14:23.328
Can you play from
around 1:20 a.m. last night?

14:32.771 --> 14:34.806
[narrator]<i> The road leading</i>
<i>to the crime scene</i>

14:34.907 --> 14:37.242
<i>is visible on the top left
of frame.</i>

14:49.255 --> 14:50.054
Pause it there.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.191
Can you play that
back again, please?

15:02.868 --> 15:03.902
Okay, let's keep playing.

15:09.742 --> 15:13.711
[Johnson]<i> The dark pickup truck
goes by and then shortly after,</i>

15:13.812 --> 15:16.214
the sedan drives past as well.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.261
They make a turn down the road

15:30.362 --> 15:31.429
toward where we found
the victim.

15:32.998 --> 15:34.465
<i>Because of the distance,</i>

15:34.566 --> 15:38.403
<i>the lighting and the
pixelation of the camera,</i>

15:38.504 --> 15:41.272
<i>we weren't able to decipher
any license plates</i>

15:41.373 --> 15:42.707
to identify the vehicles.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.910
[narrator]<i> The officer</i>
<i>continues watching</i>

15:46.011 --> 15:48.980
<i>for ten minutes to see
if the vehicles return.</i>

15:55.821 --> 15:58.589
We saw the sedan come back out
to the intersection.

16:03.195 --> 16:05.063
[narrator]<i> The pickup</i>
<i>never appears again.</i>

16:08.267 --> 16:10.768
[Johnson]<i> After we believe</i>
<i>the body was dumped,</i>

16:10.869 --> 16:14.772
the pickup truck and the car,
they go separate directions,

16:14.873 --> 16:16.240
so they're no longer together.

16:21.747 --> 16:24.182
<i>The medical examiner noted,
somewhere in the area</i>

16:24.283 --> 16:28.186
of 35 stab wounds
to her head and to her neck.

16:29.788 --> 16:31.656
<i>There was blunt force trauma,</i>

16:31.757 --> 16:36.160
<i>which means her head
was impacted significantly.</i>

16:36.261 --> 16:40.932
And he also determined that probably the
primary cause of death was strangulation.

16:41.033 --> 16:43.801
[Johnson]<i> It certainly</i>
<i>appeared this was a struggle,</i>

16:43.902 --> 16:45.603
<i>a pretty significant fight</i>

16:45.704 --> 16:48.039
before the victim
was actually killed.

16:52.745 --> 16:55.046
[Laliberte]<i> Part of</i>
<i>the post mortem examination</i>

16:55.147 --> 16:57.315
<i>was to lift her fingerprints</i>

16:57.416 --> 16:59.484
<i>and try to identify her
that way.</i>

16:59.585 --> 17:02.520
Our forensics officer
also took a photo of her face

17:02.621 --> 17:06.657
and attempted to use facial
recognition software to identify her.

17:08.794 --> 17:10.595
[narrator] <i>Neither method works</i>

17:10.696 --> 17:13.865
<i>and detectives still don't
know the identity of the victim.</i>

17:15.934 --> 17:16.834
[phone buzzes]

17:20.305 --> 17:21.506
Yeah, speaking.

17:23.308 --> 17:24.642
[Johnson]<i> The Auburn</i>
<i>Police Department</i>

17:24.743 --> 17:27.712
found a vehicle
that had been abandoned.

17:29.515 --> 17:32.517
From where our victim's body
had been dumped

17:32.618 --> 17:35.219
<i>to where they located the car</i>

17:35.320 --> 17:39.490
was about two
to two and a half miles away.

17:39.591 --> 17:40.925
They ran the license plate

17:42.928 --> 17:45.029
<i>and, uh, that produced
the register owner,</i>

17:46.065 --> 17:47.965
<i>64-year-old Linda Sweezer.</i>

17:50.169 --> 17:52.537
I compared that licensing
photo to our victim.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.477
It's definitely her.

17:59.578 --> 18:02.380
[Johnson]<i> Once we were able</i>
<i>to identify Linda Sweezer,</i>

18:02.481 --> 18:06.317
we were able to talk
to Linda's friends.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.352
Why would somebody
do that to her?

18:08.454 --> 18:12.790
Why, why, why, why, you know,
it just didn't make any sense.

18:13.892 --> 18:15.760
[narrator]<i> Originally</i>
<i>from Michigan,</i>

18:15.861 --> 18:19.330
<i>Linda moved to Washington
in the late 1970s,</i>

18:19.431 --> 18:21.632
<i>eventually settling
in the city of Kent.</i>

18:23.735 --> 18:26.204
She was interested in doing

18:26.305 --> 18:30.007
not social work, but
volunteered in that arena.

18:30.943 --> 18:34.745
So Linda was a caring person.

18:36.582 --> 18:42.453
So her passing was a blow
to the whole organization.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.194
[narrator]<i> Linda worked</i>
<i>as a community organizer,</i>

18:50.295 --> 18:52.463
<i>helping with food drives
for the needy</i>

18:52.564 --> 18:54.999
<i>and events honoring
Black culture.</i>

18:55.100 --> 18:58.669
[Richard]<i> For Linda, community
organizing was instinctual.</i>

18:58.770 --> 19:01.906
I don't think she had
to think about it.

19:02.007 --> 19:03.474
It was just who Linda was.

19:03.575 --> 19:05.376
This is Gwen,

19:05.477 --> 19:08.579
and my friend Linda here,
and we're talking about planning

19:08.680 --> 19:10.915
a Juneteenth celebration

19:11.016 --> 19:12.450
right here in the city of Kent.

19:12.551 --> 19:14.485
Linda, tell us how you feel
about that.

19:14.586 --> 19:16.087
I feel that's terrific.

19:16.188 --> 19:18.589
And it's something
that's gonna bring

19:18.690 --> 19:21.592
a natural awareness
to our people

19:21.693 --> 19:24.896
and also to the people
in our community

19:24.997 --> 19:28.599
who would like to know
some things about us

19:28.700 --> 19:31.102
that, in their eyes,
is a mystery,

19:31.203 --> 19:33.304
but all it is is history.

19:33.405 --> 19:35.640
[laughs] Love it, love it.

19:38.911 --> 19:42.914
[Laliberte]<i> Linda Sweezer</i>
<i>led a life of devotion</i>

19:43.015 --> 19:45.383
and sacrifice for her family.

19:45.484 --> 19:47.485
She didn't have
a criminal history.

19:47.586 --> 19:49.587
She's was a law-abiding citizen.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.155
- See you then.
- All right.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.456
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.029
Now that we've
identified Linda Sweezer,

19:59.565 --> 20:01.065
we have her address.

20:02.401 --> 20:03.334
Hello.

20:05.070 --> 20:08.606
I got a phone call from the Department
of Social and Human Services.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.209
They told me that Linda

20:11.310 --> 20:13.978
<i>possibly had custody
of her granddaughter.</i>

20:14.079 --> 20:15.146
On my way.

20:15.847 --> 20:17.081
<i>And my heart sank.</i>

20:18.350 --> 20:20.585
<i>I was hoping to God</i>

20:20.686 --> 20:23.321
<i>that we weren't going to find
a baby in the house,</i>

20:23.422 --> 20:26.424
and if we did, I was really
hoping it would be alive.

20:34.633 --> 20:36.834
In the downstairs area,
it was pretty obvious

20:36.935 --> 20:39.103
right away that there had been
a struggle.

20:39.204 --> 20:40.871
<i>There was a stroller
that was overturned.</i>

20:43.709 --> 20:46.410
We could see blood spatter
on the carpet

20:46.511 --> 20:49.280
and in the linoleum
on the kitchen floor.

20:49.381 --> 20:52.817
We were pretty certain that the
murder occurred in her house.

20:57.723 --> 20:59.457
The home was a split level,

20:59.558 --> 21:02.093
so there were several floors
that we had to cover.

21:07.232 --> 21:08.566
I checked the left bedroom.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.334
My lieutenant checked
the right bedroom.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.839
Come quick.
You need to see this.

21:20.979 --> 21:22.246
Oh, my God.

21:28.353 --> 21:30.621
And my heart sank.

21:41.266 --> 21:44.468

[woman over radio]

21:52.144 --> 21:53.244
[man over radio]

21:53.345 --> 21:54.445
Finding the baby alive

21:54.546 --> 21:57.014
was just a little light
of hope in this whole case.

21:58.684 --> 22:01.452
<i>We were pretty certain Linda's
been killed in the house.</i>

22:01.553 --> 22:02.820
<i>We couldn't understand</i>

22:02.921 --> 22:06.490
why the baby
was left upstairs unattended.

22:06.591 --> 22:09.427
My first thought was that
whoever the suspects were

22:09.528 --> 22:13.397
didn't know that that baby
was upstairs in a closed room.

22:13.498 --> 22:16.200
We believe Linda
was doing everything

22:16.301 --> 22:19.070
that she could to try
and protect that baby.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.742
So we'll see you
in two weeks. Okay?

22:24.843 --> 22:26.310
[phone buzzes]

22:26.411 --> 22:27.712
Oh, I better take this.

[narrator]<i> Linda's sister Vercy
is a nurse living in Michigan.</i>

22:31.316 --> 22:33.551
[Vercy]<i> I was at work</i>
<i>when I found the news out.</i>

22:33.652 --> 22:36.654
My cousin Della,
she said, "Vercy..."

22:36.755 --> 22:39.790
She said, "Oh, my God,
I am so sorry."

22:39.891 --> 22:40.858
Sorry?

22:40.959 --> 22:43.861
<i>And she said,
"You don't even know, do you?"</i>

22:43.962 --> 22:46.230
<i>I said, "Know what?"</i>

22:46.331 --> 22:48.866
<i>And she didn't tell me, She
said, "I'm going to send you a link</i>"

22:50.402 --> 22:53.003
"and I want you
to just look at it."

22:53.105 --> 22:56.674
<i>And she sent me the link

22:56.775 --> 22:58.409
[screams]

22:58.510 --> 23:01.145
<i>...I let out a horrible scream.</i>

23:01.246 --> 23:03.247
Everybody came running
into the break room

23:03.348 --> 23:05.282
and saying, "Are you okay?
Are you okay?"

23:06.218 --> 23:08.119
I said, "Linda's been murdered."

23:10.822 --> 23:12.556
On October the sixth,

23:12.657 --> 23:16.660
Linda sent me a picture
of her and the baby together,

23:17.596 --> 23:19.897
<i>and she wrote on there,</i>

23:19.998 --> 23:22.700
<i>"See you all
at the next family reunion."</i>

23:22.801 --> 23:25.169
You know, she was murdered,
like, two weeks later,

23:25.270 --> 23:27.805
almost after that date
right there.

23:35.380 --> 23:36.947
[narrator]<i> At Linda's home,</i>

23:37.048 --> 23:38.916
<i>investigators searched
for any clues</i>

23:39.017 --> 23:41.318
<i>that may reveal
the killer's identity.</i>

23:44.689 --> 23:46.690
[Laliberte]<i> We could see</i>
<i>areas of the office</i>

23:46.792 --> 23:48.659
<i>that look to have been
rummaged through.</i>

23:48.760 --> 23:51.195
Uh, maybe in
a burglary type scenario,

23:51.296 --> 23:53.631
we still weren't sure.

23:53.732 --> 23:55.833
We did not find
anything suspicious

23:55.934 --> 23:57.701
nor that would lead us
to a suspect.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.139
[narrator]<i> Detectives</i>
<i>turn their attention</i>

24:02.240 --> 24:03.774
<i>to Linda's abandoned car.</i>

24:05.677 --> 24:06.877
[Laliberte]<i> We're looking</i>
<i>for any evidence</i>

24:06.978 --> 24:08.679
<i>that will either tell us</i>

24:08.780 --> 24:11.515
<i>what happened
or who our suspects are.</i>

24:11.616 --> 24:14.084
So part of that would be
taking fingerprints,

24:14.186 --> 24:17.388
taking DNA swabs
and try and identify

24:17.489 --> 24:19.356
<i>who was in Linda's vehicle.</i>

24:19.458 --> 24:21.258
<i>We're looking
for high touch surfaces</i>

24:21.359 --> 24:23.527
<i>like the steering wheel,
the gear shift,</i>

24:23.628 --> 24:24.895
<i>uh, the rear view mirror.</i>

24:27.032 --> 24:28.966
While processing
Linda's vehicle,

24:30.168 --> 24:31.469
<i>we opened the trunk.</i>

24:38.577 --> 24:41.579
We could see large amount
of blood on the carpeting.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.616
Linda's car was clearly
taken from her home

24:45.717 --> 24:47.218
with her in the trunk.

24:50.856 --> 24:52.790
<i>Her car was then
driven to the point</i>

24:52.891 --> 24:55.359
<i>where she was taken out
of the vehicle and set on fire.</i>

24:56.428 --> 24:58.128
You want to know
who was driving that car.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.998
There is at least one,

25:01.099 --> 25:04.969
we believe probably two
people that are dangerous,

25:05.070 --> 25:06.370
that are still running around
out there

25:06.471 --> 25:07.938
and we have no idea
who they are.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.341
[phone ringing]

25:12.244 --> 25:13.744
Yep. Speaking.

25:16.615 --> 25:18.349
Thanks. We'll want
to follow this one up.

25:18.450 --> 25:20.551
We were notified that a victim

25:20.652 --> 25:23.120
in the city of Auburn,
Dixie Reynolds,

25:23.221 --> 25:24.889
<i>someone burglarized her home</i>

25:24.990 --> 25:25.956
<i>and stole her vehicle.</i>

25:27.292 --> 25:31.962
That burglary was very close
to the location

25:32.063 --> 25:34.932
where Linda Sweezer's vehicle
had been abandoned.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.967
If our suspect was trying
to get out of the area,

25:37.068 --> 25:39.637
it would make sense that he
would steal a vehicle to do that.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.275
[narrator]<i> The victim agrees</i>
<i>to have her statement taped.</i>

25:46.711 --> 25:49.380
So I woke up this morning
to... I found a clock ticking

25:49.481 --> 25:51.415
and my garage door open.

25:51.516 --> 25:53.751
Um, and no one, it's just me
and my daughter in my home,

25:53.852 --> 25:55.219
and I called for her.

25:55.320 --> 25:56.387
She was still sleeping

25:56.521 --> 25:58.222
and I saw her light was off.

25:58.323 --> 26:02.226
So I got out of my bed
and then I heard, um,

26:02.327 --> 26:05.963
something shuffling
in my living room

26:06.064 --> 26:07.932
and I heard my car keys
were grabbed.

26:08.033 --> 26:09.733
As soon as I came down,

26:09.834 --> 26:11.368
uh, they had
gotten into the car,

26:11.469 --> 26:15.039
was pulling out
and out of the driveway.

26:15.140 --> 26:18.108
[Laliberte]<i> It was possible that the
burglary and murder weren't linked,</i>

26:18.209 --> 26:21.178
but we had to investigate
every possibility.

26:21.279 --> 26:24.281
I was told that the neighbor
directly next her house

26:24.382 --> 26:25.783
had a video camera.

26:30.989 --> 26:32.289
<i>We were able
to go to that neighbor</i>

26:32.390 --> 26:34.158
and get the footage from him.

26:40.198 --> 26:42.733
This is probably the most
important piece of evidence we have.

26:48.873 --> 26:50.908
The existence
of the surveillance camera

26:51.009 --> 26:52.176
gave me a lot of hope.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.345
Let's go to 04:30 a.m.

26:55.947 --> 26:57.815
[narrator]<i> Detectives</i>
<i>scroll to the time</i>

26:57.916 --> 27:00.384
<i>Dixie Reynolds says
her car was stolen.</i>

27:24.342 --> 27:26.510
At about 04:34 a.m.,

27:26.611 --> 27:30.014
um, an individual enters
the screen on the sidewalk.

27:30.115 --> 27:33.751
<i>He's wearing a traffic
or worker's reflective vest.</i>

27:33.852 --> 27:34.985
See if we can ID him.

27:38.023 --> 27:40.457
[narrator]<i> The man appears</i>
<i>to be African-American</i>

27:40.558 --> 27:42.660
<i>in a hat with mid length hair.</i>

27:43.662 --> 27:44.928
What's he up to?

27:53.938 --> 27:56.106
[Laliberte]<i> And he was just pacing
back and forth on the sidewalk</i>

27:56.207 --> 27:57.908
<i>like he was waiting
for somebody.</i>

27:58.009 --> 28:00.377
I thought it was odd
that our subject

28:00.445 --> 28:02.346
was wearing a reflective vest.

28:05.150 --> 28:07.084
[Johnson]<i> There are</i>
<i>a fair number</i>

28:07.185 --> 28:10.087
<i>of construction sites
nearby this,</i>

28:10.188 --> 28:11.822
so it actually appeared to me

28:11.923 --> 28:14.458
like he was kind of trying

28:14.559 --> 28:16.126
<i>to look like he belonged there.</i>

[Laliberte]<i> Subject paces</i>

<i>Then he, kind of,
disappears out of the camera</i>

28:22.534 --> 28:24.568
in the area
of Dixie Reynolds' home.

28:24.669 --> 28:26.136
Pull up the other angle.

28:26.237 --> 28:28.072
[narrator]<i> Detectives switch</i>
<i>to the camera angle</i>

28:28.173 --> 28:30.240
<i>covering part
of Dixie's driveway.</i>

28:42.253 --> 28:43.721
[Laliberte]<i> We see Dixie's car</i>

28:43.822 --> 28:45.489
<i>back out of her driveway
and stop.</i>

28:49.761 --> 28:51.628
<i>My subject got out of the car,</i>

28:51.730 --> 28:53.664
went and closed the
garage door, it would appear.

29:09.881 --> 29:12.116
<i>Got back in the car
and left the neighborhood.</i>

29:15.320 --> 29:18.288
I still don't know for sure
that this is the person

29:18.389 --> 29:20.057
that killed Linda Sweezer,

29:20.158 --> 29:22.192
<i>but it's awfully suspicious</i>

29:22.293 --> 29:23.927
that the car was stolen

29:24.028 --> 29:26.396
so close to where
Linda's car was dumped.

29:36.307 --> 29:39.143
[narrator]<i> At the hospital,</i>
<i>Linda's baby granddaughter</i>

29:39.244 --> 29:41.445
<i>shows signs of improvement.</i>

29:41.546 --> 29:42.946
[Vercy]<i> He is a survivor.</i>

29:43.047 --> 29:44.214
<i>This baby is a miracle.</i>

29:45.150 --> 29:46.383
Linda, she was getting

29:46.484 --> 29:49.286
um, adoption proceedings on.

29:49.387 --> 29:52.222
<i>She had just a week
to go before her death.</i>

29:52.323 --> 29:54.057
[baby cooing]

29:54.159 --> 29:56.126
<i>Linda's death
would not be in vain,</i>

29:56.227 --> 29:57.528
<i>because I know that Linda</i>

29:57.629 --> 30:01.832
fought tooth and nail
with that murderer

30:03.234 --> 30:06.770
<i>to protect the baby,
and that baby is a miracle.</i>

30:06.871 --> 30:08.138
<i>And that baby is alive,</i>

30:08.239 --> 30:10.240
I honestly believe,
because of Linda.

30:10.341 --> 30:11.675
[sniffles]

30:17.482 --> 30:19.817
[narrator]<i> Officers have found</i>
<i>surveillance footage</i>

30:19.918 --> 30:22.386
<i>from the street where
Linda's car was abandoned.</i>

30:24.222 --> 30:25.389
We're very excited to find out

30:25.490 --> 30:27.057
that we had a doorbell camera

30:27.158 --> 30:28.592
pointing right in the direction

30:28.693 --> 30:31.295
<i>of where Linda's car was dumped.</i>

30:31.396 --> 30:32.362
<i>What we're really hoping for</i>

30:32.463 --> 30:33.564
<i>is that not only do we get</i>

30:33.665 --> 30:34.932
<i>a good picture of our suspect,</i>

30:35.033 --> 30:37.034
but that we can tie him
to Linda's vehicle,

30:37.135 --> 30:40.103
either driving it or around it.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.472
[narrator]<i> The camera</i>
<i>is motion activated,</i>

30:42.574 --> 30:45.142
<i>allowing investigators
to instantly locate</i>

30:45.243 --> 30:49.780
<i>a recording made
on October 24tn at 01:50 a.m.</i>

30:51.683 --> 30:53.083
[Benton]<i> The timing</i>
<i>is particularly important</i>

30:53.184 --> 30:55.285
because it's less
than 15 minutes

30:55.386 --> 30:57.955
from the video surveillance

30:58.056 --> 31:00.924
showing where Linda's body
was burned.

31:02.093 --> 31:02.726
Okay, hit play.

31:26.784 --> 31:30.220
I can see our suspect
walk up to the doorbell camera

31:30.321 --> 31:31.488
and, kind of... It looks like

31:31.589 --> 31:33.090
<i>he's peering into the house.</i>

31:33.191 --> 31:34.458
Play that again.

31:43.668 --> 31:46.803
It almost looks like he
identifies the doorbell camera,

31:46.905 --> 31:48.405
<i>and he turns quickly</i>

31:48.506 --> 31:49.740
and starts to walk away from it

31:49.807 --> 31:51.375
back toward Linda's car.

32:02.954 --> 32:04.388
[Johnson]<i> We were all</i>
<i>pretty excited</i>

32:04.489 --> 32:07.424
because this was
the first footage that we saw

32:07.525 --> 32:10.160
you could actually
see the man's face.

32:10.261 --> 32:12.062
See his whole body,
see what he was wearing.

32:17.502 --> 32:20.537
Pull up the camera
from the other house.

32:20.638 --> 32:22.272
[narrator]<i> They compare</i>
<i>the suspect</i>

32:22.373 --> 32:25.309
<i>with the one captured
on Dixie's neighbor's camera.</i>

32:32.617 --> 32:33.450
That's him.

32:36.020 --> 32:37.521
[Laliberte]<i> It's our suspect</i>
<i>in both of them.</i>

32:37.622 --> 32:38.889
<i>But he's changed his appearance.</i>

32:38.990 --> 32:40.958
He started wearing
the reflective vest

32:41.059 --> 32:43.493
at the point
when he took Dixie's car.

32:46.464 --> 32:49.433
This is probably the most
important piece of evidence we have.

32:49.534 --> 32:51.802
It not only
identifies our suspect,

32:51.903 --> 32:54.004
<i>but it puts him
in relation to Linda's car,</i>

32:54.105 --> 32:56.206
and everything is starting
to fall into place.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.543
[narrator]<i> Investigators</i>
<i>are convinced</i>

32:59.644 --> 33:02.346
<i>they're looking
at one of Linda's killers.</i>

33:02.447 --> 33:05.449
<i>Now they have to find him.</i>

33:05.550 --> 33:07.317
[Laliberte]<i> My team</i>
<i>was continuing to canvass</i>

33:07.418 --> 33:09.086
<i>and talk to witnesses,</i>

33:09.187 --> 33:10.921
and they encountered a young man

33:11.022 --> 33:12.956
who said that he might have

33:13.057 --> 33:15.225
<i>information on Linda's car.</i>

33:21.299 --> 33:22.366
Could you tell us what happened

33:22.467 --> 33:23.867
in the early hours
of October 24th?

33:24.002 --> 33:25.469
Um, I was driving home

33:25.570 --> 33:26.870
from my girlfriend's house,

33:28.773 --> 33:30.407
<i>and then I saw this guy.</i>

33:31.342 --> 33:32.542
[man] Hey, you. You all right?

33:33.611 --> 33:36.079
Thin, hair tied
to the back of his head.

33:37.582 --> 33:39.383
[Laliberte]<i> Our suspect</i>
<i>approached him</i>

33:39.484 --> 33:42.319
and he said he saw
the car there,

33:42.420 --> 33:44.254
and the suspect asked him

33:44.355 --> 33:46.857
if he could give him
a ride out of the area.

33:46.958 --> 33:48.458
And he said no. And he says...

33:48.593 --> 33:50.594
Well, could you get me some gas?

33:50.695 --> 33:51.862
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

33:51.963 --> 33:53.296
Thanks.

33:53.398 --> 33:55.732
[Laliberte]<i> So our suspect</i>
<i>took empty gas cans</i>

33:55.833 --> 33:57.501
off the trunk
and gave it to him.

34:02.740 --> 34:04.541
Our witness drove by himself

34:04.642 --> 34:06.843
to a gas station,
filled it with gas

34:06.944 --> 34:08.412
and brought it back
to our suspect.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.952
Our suspect then
put the gas in the car.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.287
He tried to start it.

34:17.388 --> 34:18.588
[engine stalling]

34:23.161 --> 34:24.361
<i>After the car wouldn't start,</i>

34:24.462 --> 34:25.996
<i>our suspect asked the witness</i>

34:26.097 --> 34:27.464
if he could borrow
his cell phone

34:27.565 --> 34:28.465
to make a couple of calls.

34:33.671 --> 34:35.105
And he did.
He called two numbers.

34:36.774 --> 34:38.141
He's leaving a trace.

34:38.242 --> 34:39.709
It's like leaving bread crumbs.

34:39.811 --> 34:40.977
[phone ringing]

34:45.817 --> 34:47.050
Can we have a look
at your phone, please.

34:47.151 --> 34:47.784
Yeah.

34:53.024 --> 34:54.591
[Laliberte]<i> Running</i>
<i>the phone numbers</i>

34:54.692 --> 34:56.359
<i>through the law enforcement
database</i>

34:56.461 --> 34:57.994
<i>we're able to come up
with two names.</i>

34:59.297 --> 35:02.032
One is Laura Saloi

35:02.133 --> 35:04.167
and the other one
is Jason Jordan.

35:04.268 --> 35:07.003
[narrator]<i> Laura and Jason</i>
<i>are mother and son.</i>

35:07.105 --> 35:09.406
So while searching through
the law enforcement database

35:09.507 --> 35:11.741
<i>on Laura Saloi, we discover</i>

35:11.843 --> 35:15.212
that she also has a 25 year
old son named Lance Rougeau.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.484
[narrator]<i> A background</i>
<i>check reveals</i>

35:20.585 --> 35:23.820
<i>that the 25-year-old
Rougeau is an ex con</i>

35:23.921 --> 35:27.057
<i>with a string
of burglary offenses.</i>

35:27.158 --> 35:29.459
[Johnson]<i> I'm able to compare</i>
<i>that booking photo</i>

35:29.560 --> 35:31.728
with the video surveillance,

35:31.829 --> 35:34.297
and it was pretty clear
that it was the same person.

35:34.398 --> 35:35.966
Now our focus is to find Lance

35:36.067 --> 35:37.067
and get him into custody.

35:39.504 --> 35:41.304
We knew that this was
a dangerous person

35:41.405 --> 35:43.240
and we needed to find him
as soon as we could.

35:47.979 --> 35:48.879
[siren wailing]

35:48.980 --> 35:50.514
I now have a name to this guy

35:50.615 --> 35:52.282
who murdered Linda Sweezer.

35:53.351 --> 35:55.018
[Benton]<i> We found out</i>
<i>Lance's mother</i>

35:55.119 --> 35:56.953
lived at a particular
address in Kent,

35:57.054 --> 35:58.522
which was less than a mile away

35:58.623 --> 36:00.891
<i>from where Linda Sweezer lived.</i>

36:03.161 --> 36:05.128
[Johnson]<i> When the police</i>
<i>arrived there,</i>

36:05.229 --> 36:07.430
they actually saw our suspect

36:07.532 --> 36:09.166
standing on
his mother's balcony.

36:13.404 --> 36:14.971
During the search,
we find a backpack

36:15.072 --> 36:17.474
belonging
to Dixie Reynolds' daughter

36:17.575 --> 36:19.276
<i>and looking inside the backpack,</i>

36:19.377 --> 36:20.977
we found two sets of keys,

36:21.078 --> 36:22.646
one for Linda Sweezer's car

36:22.747 --> 36:25.282
and one for Dixie Reynolds'
silver car.

36:27.585 --> 36:29.019
<i>Now we have
Lance Rougeau in custody,</i>

36:29.120 --> 36:30.320
and we want answers.

36:51.976 --> 36:53.910
[Laliberte]<i> He was</i>
<i>very dismissive.</i>

36:54.011 --> 36:56.880
He's kind of lethargic,
not real focused.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.528
[Laliberte]<i> He denied</i>
<i>having any involvement</i>

37:11.629 --> 37:13.463
<i>of Linda Sweezer's death.</i>

37:13.564 --> 37:15.265
My overall feeling at this point

37:15.366 --> 37:16.900
is that Lance
wasn't working alone,

37:17.001 --> 37:18.501
that someone else was involved

37:18.603 --> 37:20.170
either at Linda's residence

37:20.271 --> 37:22.105
<i>or helping dump her body.</i>

37:43.060 --> 37:45.061
Lance decided
not to talk with us.

37:45.162 --> 37:46.196
<i>It was very frustrating.</i>

37:46.297 --> 37:47.664
<i>We just wanted to know
what happened.</i>

37:55.606 --> 37:58.541
[narrator]<i> One month</i>
<i>after Linda's brutal murder,</i>

37:58.643 --> 38:00.744
<i>the forensic results are in.</i>

38:00.845 --> 38:04.347
Lance Rougeau's DNA
is in Linda's Sweezer's car.

38:04.448 --> 38:06.650
[narrator]<i> It's enough</i>
<i>evidence to charge him.</i>

38:07.585 --> 38:10.186
Along with Lance Rougeau's DNA,

38:10.288 --> 38:12.956
there was also
an unidentified female's DNA

38:13.057 --> 38:14.291
<i>in the mix with that.</i>

38:14.392 --> 38:16.259
Was there someone else
in the car with him?

38:19.630 --> 38:21.898
<i>That DNA is run
through a database.</i>

38:22.967 --> 38:24.634
[narrator]<i> Detectives get a hit.</i>

38:24.735 --> 38:27.404
<i>The DNA belongs
to Sharia Doolling Rodin.</i>

38:29.206 --> 38:31.474
We have to locate
and interview her.

38:35.980 --> 38:39.749
[Johnson]<i> Sharia tells us</i>
<i>that she was at a casino</i>

38:39.850 --> 38:41.351
and met Lance Rougeau.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.891
[Johnson]<i> So she got in the car.</i>

38:47.992 --> 38:49.826
<i>At that point,
she doesn't even know</i>

38:49.927 --> 38:52.462
<i>that Linda Sweezer's body
is in the trunk.</i>

38:52.563 --> 38:55.965
Um, but she does
tell us that she gets

38:56.067 --> 38:58.034
a weird feeling from Lance.

39:09.547 --> 39:11.448
While they're driving,
she actually calls a friend

39:11.549 --> 39:12.482
<i>to come pick her up.</i>

39:18.222 --> 39:20.824
[Johnson]<i> Her friend agrees</i>
<i>to pick her up,</i>

39:20.925 --> 39:22.892
drives up into the area

39:22.993 --> 39:24.994
where Linda Sweezer was found.

39:31.836 --> 39:32.902
[Benton]<i> That was the truck</i>

39:33.938 --> 39:36.339
that we see on that first video,

39:36.440 --> 39:39.476
<i>that goes past the intersection,</i>

39:39.577 --> 39:43.346
<i>comes back and stops
where the sedan is.</i>

39:43.447 --> 39:46.316
<i>It's at that time that Sharia
gets out of the car,</i>

39:46.417 --> 39:49.452
she gets into the truck
and they leave.

39:51.088 --> 39:53.790
[narrator]<i> Linda's body</i>
<i>is then set alight,</i>

39:53.891 --> 39:56.226
<i>which is why
the reflection of the fire</i>

39:56.327 --> 39:58.261
<i>was only seen
on the black sedan.</i>

40:02.266 --> 40:04.267
All right. Thank you very much.

40:04.368 --> 40:05.869
[Laliberte] We figured out
through the investigation

40:05.970 --> 40:09.372
that she was an unknown
participant in this.

40:09.473 --> 40:12.142
[narrator]<i> Investigators</i>
<i>confirm Sharia's story,</i>

40:12.243 --> 40:13.743

<i>Lance Rougeau's
mother and brother</i>

<i>Police now know Rougeau was
the sole participant in Linda's murder.</i>

<i>In February 2020,</i>

40:31.562 --> 40:33.430
<i>Lance Rougeau stands trial.</i>

40:35.032 --> 40:36.433
<i>The prosecution lays out</i>

<i>what happened that night.</i>

40:40.004 --> 40:43.907
[Benton]<i> Linda Sweezer, who lived
in her home with her granddaughter.</i>

40:45.075 --> 40:48.812
And on that particular night,

40:49.680 --> 40:50.947
<i>her home was burglarized.</i>

[narrator]<i> Prolific</i>

<i>and chose Linda's house
to break into.</i>

40:59.457 --> 41:00.890
<i>She interrupted that burglary.</i>

41:00.991 --> 41:03.259
[Linda] Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!

41:03.360 --> 41:05.161
[Benton]<i> She was fighting</i>
<i>not only for herself,</i>

41:05.262 --> 41:06.930
<i>she was fighting
for her granddaughter as well.</i>

41:08.032 --> 41:10.033
She was brutally murdered
in her home.

41:11.669 --> 41:12.869
<i>Her body's put in her car.</i>

41:14.038 --> 41:15.138
She was driven around.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.074
Could have been for many hours,

41:18.175 --> 41:20.009
<i>even as much as a couple days.</i>

41:20.110 --> 41:21.744
<i>She was removed
from the trunk of that car</i>

<i>and she was set on fire.</i>

41:27.451 --> 41:29.519
<i>Linda Sweezer's car

41:29.620 --> 41:32.655
<i>He needed a way
out of that neighborhood</i>

41:32.756 --> 41:35.258
and he found
Dixie Reynolds' home.
