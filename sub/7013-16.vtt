Forman, why'd you have
to tell Red you got engaged?

00:06.339 --> 00:09.103
Look at him-
yelling and waving.

00:10.877 --> 00:13.141
Oh! A little spit
just landed on Bob.

00:14.514 --> 00:18.041
Bob's so scared,
he's not even wiping it off.

00:18.118 --> 00:20.086
Oh, my God.

00:20.153 --> 00:23.611
Oh, my God. This time
Red is really gonna kill me.

00:23.690 --> 00:28.627
My only hope is that he actually
sticks his foot so far up my ass...

00:28.695 --> 00:32.290
he can't pull it out, and I get to take him
straight to hell with me.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.794
Why did you tell him?
We had it all planned.

00:36.870 --> 00:40.931
We were gonna give them wine, get 'em all
loose and juiced. But you spilled the beans.

00:41.007 --> 00:44.670
Good, because wine and beans
is not a good combo.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.211
Hey. Toot-toot,
if you know what I mean.

00:50.216 --> 00:52.150
Sorry I'm late!

00:52.218 --> 00:54.652
I was cutting through
backyards on the way over here...

00:54.721 --> 00:57.121
and the Hendersons
got a new jungle gym!

00:57.190 --> 00:59.158
Whoa.
They're still yelling?

00:59.225 --> 01:02.820
Yeah. I'm trying to read Red's lips,
but I can't make it out.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.262
He keeps calling me
a "stupid duck."

01:10.036 --> 01:13.267
- [Snaps Fingers]
- Ah!

01:13.339 --> 01:15.273
Hey, I'll go spy on them.

01:15.341 --> 01:18.504
I just gotta run home real quick
and change into my ninja outfit.

01:18.578 --> 01:21.843
I don't think this situation
calls for camouflage, Kelso.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.440
Well, that doesn't mean
it's not fun to wear, Eric!

01:26.086 --> 01:28.680
But they're just too young
to get married.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.746
How are they gonna
live on their own?

01:30.824 --> 01:34.817
Eric jumps a foot
every time the furnace kicks on.

01:36.329 --> 01:39.059
Exactly. He's not mature enough
to get married.

01:39.132 --> 01:42.590
I'm still cutting the crusts
off his sandwiches.

01:43.870 --> 01:48.170
Well, it's really more for me.
He's my baby.

01:48.241 --> 01:50.937
Don't mind me.
Feel free to keep talking.

01:51.010 --> 01:53.877
I'm just getting a soda.
I'm not spying.

01:55.882 --> 01:57.975
Hey, l-I don't like
this engagement either...

01:58.051 --> 02:00.042
but it's not like
they can break it off.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.452
Why the hell not?

02:02.522 --> 02:05.116
Well, it wouldn't be
very romantic, for one.

02:05.191 --> 02:07.887
Oh, forget about it.
I'll take care of this myself!

02:07.961 --> 02:11.624
No, no. Red, if you go out there and yell,
you're just gonna drive him away.

02:11.698 --> 02:16.499
I'm sorry, Kitty, but yelling is the only part
of being a father that I enjoy.

02:16.569 --> 02:20.027
Red- Red, I am putting my foot down.
I forbid it.

02:20.106 --> 02:22.097
All right. Fine.

02:22.175 --> 02:25.440
Wow! Red, I forbid you to-

02:25.512 --> 02:27.446
Shut up, Bob.

02:27.514 --> 02:29.948
Burn!
[Laughs]

02:30.016 --> 02:31.950
- Get out!
- Yeah.

02:35.021 --> 02:37.285
Well?
What were they saying?

02:37.357 --> 02:39.791
I don't know.

02:39.859 --> 02:43.124
Well, I was so busy acting
like I wasn't listening, I forgot to listen.

- [Groans]
- Man!

02:45.532 --> 02:47.966
I betcha he's trying
to think of a punishment.

02:48.034 --> 02:51.299
He already took away the Vista Cruiser
and- and fined me.

02:51.371 --> 02:54.499
What's next?
Is he gonna cut off my pinkie?

02:54.574 --> 02:56.508
Ay!

02:56.576 --> 02:59.602
What's the point of getting married,
Red's gonna cut that off?

And here at the D.M.V., I've learned
it's easier to solve problems...

in a multiple-choice format.

04:10.316 --> 04:13.080

the tension...

- Pass the peas, Steven.

Red, your son spoke to you.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.395

Nah! Wait! Wait. I want to hear this.
"I did it" who?

10:29.942 --> 10:33.378
Wait. Fez, I can't believe
you finally lost your virginity!

10:33.445 --> 10:37.108
Wait, wait. This isn't
like the time you bought a hamster...

10:37.182 --> 10:40.345

and then lost it, is it?

10:47.860 --> 10:50.226
No. This is the real thing.

10:50.295 --> 10:52.763
You know,
I had a hamster once.

10:52.831 --> 10:55.095
I tied him up to a helium balloon
with a note.

10:55.167 --> 10:57.829

to Minnesota.

- So? Come on. Tell us all about it.
- Yeah.

11:07.679 --> 11:10.580
Okay. Well, It was incredible.

11:10.649 --> 11:13.482
Nina and I started out
kissing in the living room.

11:13.552 --> 11:17.420
Then we moved into the bedroom,
where we undressed.

11:17.489 --> 11:20.890
And, uh, well, then-
then we did it.

11:22.628 --> 11:25.995
What- Details, Fez.
We need details!

11:26.064 --> 11:28.760
Well, our faces
didn't line up right...

11:28.834 --> 11:31.962
so I kept bumping my chin
on her nose.

11:35.007 --> 11:37.032
And then there were
some sounds.

11:37.109 --> 11:39.077
What kind of sounds?

11:40.445 --> 11:42.845
I will say this.
It was not applause.

11:45.150 --> 11:49.951
There was no romantic music
like in the movies, so I had to hum.

11:53.859 --> 11:56.760
And then Nina told me
to stop humming.

11:56.828 --> 12:00.855
And, uh, then I started again
without realizing it.

12:02.301 --> 12:06.567
And then she got mad.
And then I think she got sad.

12:06.638 --> 12:08.572
Oh, well, don't worry, Fez.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.473
She probably just felt bad
she was doing it with a foreigner.

12:15.247 --> 12:18.478
And then afterwards,
I went into the bathroom, and, uh-

12:18.550 --> 12:20.711
and cried a little.

12:25.157 --> 12:27.648
And then I snuck out
the back door.

Well, you know, at least
it couldn't have been any worse.

in her bathroom.

Nope. One day I just woke up,

Next question.

12:58.023 --> 13:00.184
Well, I think, um-

13:00.259 --> 13:04.195
I think what Mr. Forman
is <i>trying</i> to say...

13:04.263 --> 13:07.494
is that we worry you're
too young to get married.

13:07.566 --> 13:11.798
Do you even know how to bake a casserole?
I don't think you do.

13:11.870 --> 13:15.533
Look, I believe there's one person
out there for everyone.

13:15.607 --> 13:20.067
And you guys are that person for each other,
and Eric is that person for me.

13:20.145 --> 13:22.136
And if you could just
open your hearts...

13:22.214 --> 13:24.910
you'd see that we should
be together forever.

13:24.983 --> 13:28.384
Because we're in love,
and we make each other really happy.

13:28.453 --> 13:30.944
Donna, that is so romantic.

13:32.557 --> 13:35.355
I still think you're too young.

13:35.427 --> 13:37.918
But if it has to be someone,
I'm glad it's you.

13:37.996 --> 13:40.487

13:57.416 --> 14:00.112
- Really?
- Yes!

14:00.185 --> 14:02.380
You're as big a dumb-ass
as he is!

14:06.858 --> 14:10.885
[Laughing]

14:10.962 --> 14:13.021
Welcome to the family.

14:15.133 --> 14:17.727
I'm so nervous about
working with Nina today.

14:17.803 --> 14:21.204
It's like, now that we did it,
I never want to see her face again.

14:24.710 --> 14:26.610
Yeah, you did it, all right.

14:29.147 --> 14:32.708
Hey, hey! Look who's
wearing a $27 sweater!

14:33.785 --> 14:35.946
Jackie, you can't keep
that sweater.

14:36.021 --> 14:38.455
- Why not?
- Because it's from Kelso.

14:38.523 --> 14:42.926
Yeah, but it's so pink and fuzzy
that it just makes up for it.

14:42.994 --> 14:45.861
Kelso, she's someone else's girlfriend.
What are you doing?

14:45.931 --> 14:47.922
I'm not doing anything.

14:50.168 --> 14:52.693
And it's working.

14:54.172 --> 14:56.106
Just take it off.

14:56.174 --> 14:58.734
Leave it on.

14:58.810 --> 15:01.176
Take it off.
Let's see some skin.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.340
Yeah. Take it off.

15:05.417 --> 15:10.184
- Why is everyone against me?
- Because you're telling a girl to keep her top on.

15:11.289 --> 15:14.190
That's true. Take it off.

15:15.961 --> 15:17.895
<i>[Phones Ringing]</i>

15:17.963 --> 15:19.897
- Hi.
- Hello.

15:19.965 --> 15:22.024
- Go ahead.
- After you.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.398
- Here. Let me, um-
- I know how it goes.

15:24.469 --> 15:26.403
Okay. Just-
I'm just trying to help.

15:26.471 --> 15:28.405
Now it's stuck!

15:28.473 --> 15:30.407
You just have to give it a yank.

15:30.475 --> 15:32.466
This is just like last night!

15:35.080 --> 15:40.017
Okay. Where's Red? I just found out
he called my daughter a dumb-ass.

15:40.085 --> 15:43.577
- What?
- Well, I really thought I was
getting through to him.

15:43.655 --> 15:46.556
But then he snuck
a "dumb-ass" in.

15:46.625 --> 15:49.526
That is a hurtful word.

15:49.594 --> 15:51.960
You got to do something
about your husband, Kitty.

15:52.030 --> 15:53.998
You guys'd be lucky
to get Donna.

15:54.065 --> 15:56.966
If anything, she's gonna
pretty your family up.

15:59.237 --> 16:01.171
Excuse me?

16:01.239 --> 16:04.766
I'm just sayin',
we're a voluptuous bunch.

16:06.478 --> 16:09.208
Mom, you need
to talk to Dad.

16:09.281 --> 16:12.682
I don't know why you're
surprised he's upset.

16:12.751 --> 16:14.742
Why did you have
to get engaged?

16:14.820 --> 16:19.484
And why did you have to tell your father?
He's not stable, Eric.

16:21.793 --> 16:23.818
Okay, fine.
I'll talk to him myself.

16:23.895 --> 16:27.797
Eric, be careful.
I looked deep into Red's eyes, and I saw-

16:27.866 --> 16:31.131
Well, I just saw me upside down and tiny,
but he looked mad.

16:32.571 --> 16:35.734
You know what? I don't care.
I'm going down to Price Mart.

16:35.807 --> 16:39.368
And if I don't come back, then, Donna,
please move on with your life.

16:41.313 --> 16:45.875
Wedding or no wedding, we're still getting
one of those triple-decker cakes.

16:51.990 --> 16:55.824
Oh, working with someone
you have had sex with is the worst thing ever.

16:57.162 --> 17:00.154
I don't know how Donny
and Marie do it.

17:05.936 --> 17:09.737
You know,
sex ruins everything.

17:09.808 --> 17:11.833
No, I disagree, Fez.

17:11.910 --> 17:14.470
I mean, sure, the first time
can be awkward.

17:14.546 --> 17:16.513
Well, it wasn't
for me and Jackie.

17:17.781 --> 17:19.943
You know, maybe I should
tell the story.

17:21.853 --> 17:24.287
Yeah.
It's a great story, Hyde.

17:24.356 --> 17:28.554
You know what, Kelso?
It's gettin' real old.

17:28.627 --> 17:32.324
And the story I remember after your first time
was you didn't call her for a week.

17:32.397 --> 17:35.264
I was gonna skip that part.

17:35.333 --> 17:38.302
Wait. That's right.
You didn't call me.

17:38.370 --> 17:40.964
Oh. That's because he was thinking
about breaking up with you.

17:41.039 --> 17:43.439
What?

17:43.508 --> 17:46.807
No, I told you. I didn't call you 'cause
we were having our phones cleaned!

17:50.549 --> 17:52.574
And then to get back
on your good side...

17:52.651 --> 17:54.915
he bought you a stupid
stuffed unicorn.

17:57.155 --> 17:59.248
Fluffycakes?

18:01.726 --> 18:04.957
Fluffycakes is tainted?

18:06.598 --> 18:08.691
<i>See, he wanted something</i>
<i>from you.</i>

18:08.767 --> 18:11.235
So he bought you a present.
Sound familiar?

18:12.737 --> 18:15.069
Michael, why did you
buy me this sweater?

18:15.140 --> 18:18.268
All right.
It's time to come clean.

18:19.611 --> 18:21.806
I stole the sweater!

18:28.119 --> 18:30.053
Fine. You know what?
Forget it.

18:30.121 --> 18:32.146
I don't want it,
so just take it.

18:34.025 --> 18:36.323
Now we're talking.
Give us a little dance.

18:40.865 --> 18:44.460
[Inhales, Exhales]
Told you it wouldn't work.

18:44.536 --> 18:47.437
I wasn't doing anything!

18:49.808 --> 18:51.469
Hey, let's not fight.

18:51.543 --> 18:53.943
We all saw a littleJackie side-boob.
I think we all won.

18:59.851 --> 19:01.785
<i>[Knocking]</i>

19:03.922 --> 19:06.288
- Hi, Fez. Okay, look-
- Nina...

19:06.358 --> 19:08.792
I know what you're
going to say.

19:08.860 --> 19:11.351
The other night was awful,
and you just want to be friends.

19:11.429 --> 19:14.023
No. I was going to say,
the other night was awful...

19:14.099 --> 19:16.932
and we should practice
and get better at it.

19:19.771 --> 19:23.867
Oh. Well, I have to say,
I don't hate the sound of that. [Chuckles]

19:23.942 --> 19:29.312
So, um, uh, should I make
an appointment, or-

19:29.381 --> 19:32.179
- Just get in the house.
- Okay. One second.

19:33.685 --> 19:35.949
[Singsongy]
I'm going to do it again! I'm going to do it again!

19:40.291 --> 19:42.384
Okay, Dad. You can ignore me...

19:42.460 --> 19:44.985
and you can call my girlfriend names,
but here's the thing.

19:45.063 --> 19:48.829
Donna and I are getting married. Okay?
Whether you like it or not.

19:48.900 --> 19:53.098
But you're too young.
And you're throwing your life away.

19:53.171 --> 19:57.938
Wha-You said I was throwing my life away
when I quit T-ball.

19:59.644 --> 20:01.805
And I was right
about that too.

20:03.214 --> 20:05.842
You're not marrying her,
and that's final.

20:07.252 --> 20:10.688
Well, Dad, you can't stop me.
Okay?

20:10.755 --> 20:13.155
I'm gonna be graduating soon.
I'll be on my own.

20:13.224 --> 20:17.024
I have a job. I mean, I make enough money
to pay for the wedding myself.

20:18.663 --> 20:20.597
Well, that's great.
[Clears Throat]

20:20.665 --> 20:22.792
But you don't have a job.
You're fired.

20:24.169 --> 20:27.434
- What?
- You're fired.

20:27.505 --> 20:30.633
Let's see you pay
for a wedding now.

20:30.709 --> 20:33.735
Punch out
and empty your locker.

20:34.813 --> 20:36.405
Fine!

20:36.481 --> 20:39.473
- But I'm keeping the smock!
- Give me the smock!

20:49.360 --> 20:51.294
- Jackie.
- Hmm?

20:51.362 --> 20:53.296
Happy birthday.

20:53.364 --> 20:55.594
Steven, you shouldn't have!

20:55.667 --> 20:57.658
Oh!

21:01.039 --> 21:03.200
It's a Led Zeppelin T-shirt.

21:04.542 --> 21:07.238
And it's used!

21:07.312 --> 21:11.305
Yeah, that's my favorite one.
You're with me now, so I wanted you to have it.

21:11.382 --> 21:14.783
Oh! Steven, I love it!

21:16.321 --> 21:19.051
- Do I have to wear it?
- No.

21:19.124 --> 21:21.456
[Gasps]
Steven, I love it! Oh!

21:35.907 --> 21:39.741
Well, that was a nice
20 minutes of silence.

21:39.811 --> 21:43.508
Who wants a little kick in their coffee?
I know I do.

21:47.919 --> 21:50.285
You're the dumb-ass!
