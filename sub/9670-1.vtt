WEBVTT

00:48.465 --> 00:51.844
<i>He even took the gramophone on safari.</i>

00:54.638 --> 00:58.484
<i>Three rifles, supplies for a month,</i>

00:59.643 --> 01:01.065
and Mozart.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.404
<i>He began our friendship with a gift.</i>

01:08.735 --> 01:12.239
<i>And later, not long before Tsavo,</i>

01:13.240 --> 01:17.336
<i>he gave me another.
An incredible gift.</i>

01:18.245 --> 01:21.374
<i>A glimpse of the world through God's eye.</i>

01:22.708 --> 01:24.506
<i>And I thought,</i>

01:24.876 --> 01:27.504
<i>"Yes, I see.</i>

01:28.672 --> 01:31.016
<i>"This is the way it was intended."</i>

01:35.512 --> 01:37.606
<i>I've written about all the others,</i>

01:37.681 --> 01:39.683
<i>not because I loved them less,</i>

01:39.766 --> 01:43.521
<i>but because they were clearer, easier.</i>

01:45.689 --> 01:47.862
<i>He was waiting for me there.</i>

01:51.445 --> 01:55.245
<i>But I've gone ahead of my story.
He'd have hated that.</i>

01:56.074 --> 01:58.748
<i>Denys loved to hear a story told well.</i>

02:00.871 --> 02:02.418
You see,

02:03.790 --> 02:08.261
<i>I had a farm in Africa at the
foot of the Ngong Hills.</i>

02:09.420 --> 02:11.423
<i>But it began before that.</i>

02:11.923 --> 02:14.301
<i>It really began in Denmark.</i>

02:21.683 --> 02:24.152
<i>And there I knew two brothers.</i>

02:24.603 --> 02:28.107
<i>One was my lover, and one was my friend.</i>

02:28.190 --> 02:29.737
It's too cold for champagne.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.739
It's too cold for anything but.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.042
You said you'd be at Klampenborg.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.916
I thought I'd come, but then I didn't.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.499
Was it fun?

02:50.128 --> 02:51.175
Tanne.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.224
Tanne, come on.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.431
It's not as though you loved him.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.809
You'd like to be a baroness, that's all.

02:59.888 --> 03:00.888
He lied to me.

03:00.931 --> 03:02.023
Of course.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.648
Would you be in bed with him otherwise?

03:04.726 --> 03:07.605
My brother's only dull, but not stupid.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.072
Pretend it's Hans.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.410
Where would you go?

03:17.489 --> 03:18.536
Anywhere.

03:18.615 --> 03:22.495
America. Ceylon.
I would even go to Australia.

03:24.121 --> 03:27.751
Perhaps not Australia. But
I've got to be away from here.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.881
I'll give you all I've got.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.136
That should get you into town.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.135
God, it was fun. Money.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.225
You could marry me.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.686
I have to marry a virgin.
I can't stand criticism.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.806
For the money, I mean.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.018
Probably.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.489
Listen to me.
I've got no life at all.

03:50.772 --> 03:54.948
They wouldn't teach me anything
useful, and now I've failed to marry.

03:55.026 --> 03:58.701
You know the punishment for that.
"Miss Dinesen's at home."

03:59.030 --> 04:01.203
And you've gone through all your money.

04:01.283 --> 04:05.208
You're off seducing the servant girls.
We're a pair, you and I.

04:05.996 --> 04:09.671
I mean, at least we're friends.
We might be all right,

04:09.750 --> 04:13.254
and if we weren't, at least
we'd have been somewhere.

04:13.837 --> 04:16.680
You don't think you're being too romantic?

04:24.389 --> 04:27.017
Am I supposed to think you're serious?

04:30.479 --> 04:32.777
<i>I had a farm in Africa.</i>

04:36.443 --> 04:41.074
<i>I had a farm in Africa at the
foot of the Ngong Hills.</i>

04:44.534 --> 04:47.037
<i>I had a farm in Africa.</i>

07:40.877 --> 07:41.924
Good morning.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.425
Have you had trouble?

07:43.505 --> 07:45.007
Now and then.
Have you?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.467
I'm traveling to Nairobi.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.348
You caught the right train then.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.435
Get away from there!

07:53.515 --> 07:54.687
Shoo! Shoo!

07:55.100 --> 07:56.147
Shoo?

07:56.226 --> 07:58.695
That's all my crystal, my Limoges.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.063
Ah.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.864
They didn't know it was Limoges.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.453
You plan to stay then?

08:07.529 --> 08:10.703
I've come out to marry Baron Blixen.
Do you know him?

08:10.949 --> 08:12.246
Bror? Yes.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.369
We plan to start a dairy.

08:15.704 --> 08:18.378
Are you quite famous? They
stopped the train for you.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.333
It's rude not to here.

08:21.251 --> 08:24.721
A dairy? Isn't it a bit soon for that?
Milk at the door?

08:27.882 --> 08:29.008
Aren't you boarding?

08:29.092 --> 08:30.344
I'm going on.

08:30.427 --> 08:31.929
On? To where?

08:32.011 --> 08:35.767
Mention the ivory to Berkeley Cole.
Bror knows him.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.433
I'm Baroness Blixen!

08:37.933 --> 08:39.186
Not yet.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.063
Finch Hatton, Denys!

08:49.154 --> 08:51.873
I am Farah Aden.
We can go now.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.200
Where is Baron Blixen?

08:53.283 --> 08:55.957
He is at Muthaiga.
Please come.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.719
Where is Muthaiga?

09:08.298 --> 09:12.019
Muthaiga is a club where British
go for drinking. Please.

09:20.643 --> 09:24.864
Listen, on the train are my
crates with china and crystal.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.737
Do you know china?

09:26.816 --> 09:29.820
Yes. China, it can break.

10:14.781 --> 10:15.998
Stay.

10:30.004 --> 10:33.383
Excuse me, I'm looking for Baron Blixen.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.536
I wondered if you might tell me...

10:43.560 --> 10:45.437
<i>Memsahibs must not be here.</i>

10:47.021 --> 10:48.318
I'm simply looking for someone...

10:48.398 --> 10:50.116
<i>Memsahibs must not be here.</i>

11:00.201 --> 11:02.579
Where have you been?

11:02.662 --> 11:06.292
Arranging things. How was the trip?
You can tell me later.

11:07.584 --> 11:08.756
Would you like to change?

11:08.835 --> 11:10.553
My luggage is still on the train.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.630
Room "D."
Head of the stairs.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.967
I haven't gotten a ring.
Do you care?

11:15.049 --> 11:16.392
Did you think I wouldn't come?

11:16.467 --> 11:18.720
It hought you wouldn't want to spend the money.

11:18.803 --> 11:21.181
You will love it here.
The servants are wonderful.

11:21.264 --> 11:22.356
Shall we get a drink?

11:22.432 --> 11:24.605
We've got almost one hour before the wedding.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.856
One hour?

11:36.946 --> 11:38.368
Is this all right?

11:38.448 --> 11:39.950
I wondered what color you'd choose.

11:40.617 --> 11:43.996
It's ivory.
God, I've got this man's ivory.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.170
Whose ivory?

12:04.265 --> 12:07.815
I'm Sarah, Lady Belfield.
Shall I stand up for you?

12:08.311 --> 12:09.608
Short or long, Blix?

12:09.687 --> 12:12.440
Long, please.
Give me time to adjust to it.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.777
Settle down, all.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.121
By the authority of His Majesty's
Government vested in me,

12:19.197 --> 12:23.873
I declare that the Baron Bror Von
Blixen, citizen of Sweden and...

12:25.954 --> 12:27.171
What's your name, my dear?

12:27.247 --> 12:28.874
Damn it, Henry, I told you her name.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.133
Karen Christentze Dinesen.

12:31.209 --> 12:35.214
Karen Christentze Dinesen, a female
subject of the King of Denmark,

12:35.296 --> 12:37.515
are henceforth united man and wife.

12:39.133 --> 12:42.182
God save this company, God save the King.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.310
God save the King!

12:47.725 --> 12:49.022
Thank you for this.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.652
"Did you hear about Shuttleworth?"
"No," I said.

12:53.731 --> 12:57.235
"He's living up country," he
says, "in a tree with a baboon."

12:57.318 --> 13:01.118
"Male or female?" I said to him.
"Female, of course," he says.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.450
"There's nothing queer about old Shuttleworth."

13:05.743 --> 13:07.666
Where's your muddleheaded husband?

13:07.745 --> 13:09.042
The Governor's at the punch bowl,

13:09.122 --> 13:11.671
thank you, hoping to avoid you.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.376
Would you like to meet the bride?

13:13.459 --> 13:15.257
Or did you come just for the whiskey?

13:15.670 --> 13:17.923
Not for the company, God knows.

13:18.423 --> 13:21.427
Lord Delamere, may I present Baroness Blixen.

13:21.676 --> 13:25.601
Baroness Blixen, Lord Delamere, such as he is.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.938
Baroness.
A Swede, are you?

13:29.726 --> 13:31.353
No, Danish, actually.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.905
The little country next to Germany.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.905
If it comes to war, where will Denmark stand?

13:39.068 --> 13:42.868
On its own, I hope.
We do have that history.

13:43.865 --> 13:45.185
Is there something we can call you

13:45.241 --> 13:47.084
that gets round this Baroness?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.037
What do they call you?

13:49.537 --> 13:51.414
D, if I'm lucky.

14:02.759 --> 14:06.104
My stupid name's Felicity,
but I do like your dress.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.268
Thank you.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.683
It's not much of a hat.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.769
It's meant to be stunning.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.779
We die of sunstroke here.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.737
At least I'm safe from the mosquitoes.

14:19.442 --> 14:20.944
The big ones.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.207
You nervous?

14:26.616 --> 14:27.868
Should I be?

14:29.118 --> 14:32.497
You know, wedding night and all that.

14:48.763 --> 14:52.233
So they're both of them naked
and not a shrub in sight.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.566
Have you met Vicky Gresham?

14:55.645 --> 14:58.319
Hello, Baroness, I'd curtsy but I'm drunk.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.533
May I see you, please?

15:01.651 --> 15:02.777
Excuse me.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.952
If you want any friends, Tanne,

15:07.031 --> 15:09.159
I'd make them here.
There is no one else.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.874
I want to see my house.

15:13.496 --> 15:17.342
You may want to change.
It's a two-hour ride.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.846
Excuse me.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.865
My God, these people drink.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.530
I'm sorry, I was just...

15:49.115 --> 15:50.116
It's all right.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.293
I'm afraid you've caught me snooping.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.463
It's not my room, it's Denys',
and Denys won't mind.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.757
It's a thing about Denys, he doesn't mind.

15:57.832 --> 16:00.551
Are you Cole?

16:01.627 --> 16:04.380
I brought the ivory with me on the train.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.886
Well, thank you.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.477
Are you taking your quinine'?

16:09.552 --> 16:10.804
Oh, yes.

16:12.054 --> 16:15.900
He has got lovely books.
Does he lend them?

16:16.726 --> 16:18.774
We had a friend, Hopworth.

16:20.146 --> 16:23.400
He got a book and didn't return it.
Denys was furious.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.783
I said, "Denys, you wouldn't lose
a friend over a book, would you?"

16:26.861 --> 16:28.534
And he said, "No!

16:29.155 --> 16:31.078
"But he has, hasn't he?"

16:34.785 --> 16:36.628
Did you come out through London?

16:37.330 --> 16:38.752
From Rome actually.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.334
I thought you might have a newspaper.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.840
No, sorry.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.843
Nothing in them anyway.

16:47.757 --> 16:51.682
I had a friend who I used to
take to the dances at Oxford.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.105
They were in June by the river.

16:54.430 --> 16:58.355
She always wore a new silk dress.

16:58.601 --> 17:01.104
I think you're wearing her perfume.

17:09.694 --> 17:13.540
No, it's very nice, but it's not the same.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.412
We can go now.

18:16.220 --> 18:19.190
This is Belknap.
He runs the farm.

18:19.974 --> 18:21.692
Good evening, ma'am.

18:27.857 --> 18:30.576
This is your cook.
Name is Esa.

18:37.533 --> 18:40.127
And this is Juma. Houseboy.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.924
Come, see your house.

18:50.212 --> 18:53.432
When you leave me, I'm
going to marry Berkeley Cole.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.009
A man in trade.

18:55.343 --> 18:56.970
Is that what he does?

18:57.053 --> 19:00.648
He is thick with the Somalis. There's
a crowd of them up on his land

19:00.723 --> 19:02.725
who think he's some sort of prince.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.852
He sells Finch Hatton's ivory.

19:05.686 --> 19:08.155
Belknap is a cheery sort.

19:08.356 --> 19:11.986
Had a place of his own. Went
belly up trying to grow flax.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.571
Does he know cattle?

19:15.905 --> 19:20.285
I didn't buy cattle. We're
going to grow coffee instead.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.470
That's not what we planned.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.506
You were in Denmark, I had to decide.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.724
We made a decision.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.428
We don't know anything about coffee.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.187
You plant it, it grows.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.435
My mother put her money up to do a dairy.

19:42.515 --> 19:46.520
She doesn't care whether it's cows
or coffee as long as it pays.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.696
You must be with a herd or things go wrong.

19:48.771 --> 19:51.775
I didn't come to Africa to sit with silly cows.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.360
Just tell her we changed our minds.

19:54.902 --> 19:59.248
Next time you change your mind,
you do it with your money.

20:01.325 --> 20:04.454
They bought you a title.
They didn't buy me.

20:07.915 --> 20:11.260
Fetch some wine for my lover's brother.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.718
I think you're tired.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.980
Be careful.

20:32.606 --> 20:35.359
Did I tell you Hans came to say goodbye?

20:54.795 --> 20:56.342
Where is Baron Blixen?

20:57.006 --> 20:58.553
He's gone to hunt.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.343
Did he say when he would be back?

21:01.427 --> 21:03.555
He says he can come before the rain.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.312
Is it going to rain today?

21:08.601 --> 21:11.195
It can be many days before the rains.

21:44.053 --> 21:46.977
In Ohio we put up scarecrows
to keep the birds away.

21:47.056 --> 21:50.185
Here you hope there're enough
leopards to keep down the baboons.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.736
'Course they'll take your dog, too.
That's Africa.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.155
How much will we plant?

21:54.688 --> 21:55.814
1,000 acres, the Baron <i>says.</i>

21:55.898 --> 21:57.491
How long will that take?

21:57.566 --> 22:01.241
That depends on Kinanjui.
He's the chief of the Kikuyu.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.072
Got a deal with him to get you help.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.283
When will be our first harvest?

22:06.033 --> 22:09.879
These are seedlings. It'll
be three, maybe four years.

22:10.788 --> 22:12.085
Four years!

22:12.248 --> 22:15.878
If they bear at all. No one's
ever tried coffee this high.

22:16.794 --> 22:20.048
And what are we going to live on for four years?

22:20.130 --> 22:23.760
I'm working to get home.
Now, if you haven't got it,

22:23.843 --> 22:25.595
it'd be good if you could tell me right now.

22:28.222 --> 22:30.065
We will plant 500.

22:32.768 --> 22:36.864
Chief Kinanjui, I have heard
that you are a wise chief...

22:36.939 --> 22:41.069
Not now, please. And I look
forward to our dealings.

22:42.236 --> 22:44.455
Your Kikuyu are good workers.

22:44.613 --> 22:49.369
I look forward to dealing with
them honestly, and fairly.

22:49.952 --> 22:52.171
This chief has no British.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.927
Tell him that I am Baroness Blixen.

22:58.002 --> 22:59.800
This chief knows that.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.391
Tell him what I said.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.506
What did he say?

23:39.585 --> 23:41.838
He says these Kikuyu can do this work.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.226
Farah, what else did he...

24:09.782 --> 24:11.659
Your leg is very sick.

24:14.578 --> 24:17.331
You must come to the house for medicine.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.842
Does he understand me?

24:21.001 --> 24:22.002
Yes.

24:25.798 --> 24:29.393
If you don't come, the other
boys will say you are afraid.

24:33.722 --> 24:36.396
I myself will think only that you are foolish.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.070
This boy must come to my house for treatment.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.065
See that he does.

24:45.067 --> 24:47.195
What else did Kinanjui say?

24:47.987 --> 24:50.706
He says coffee must not grow this high.

24:52.074 --> 24:55.044
Never mind.
He's a chief, but he's a Kikuyu.

25:28.902 --> 25:33.749
If you put a dam here to stop the
water then I can make a pond here.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.496
Do you know how to make a pond?

25:35.576 --> 25:37.453
This water must go home to Mombasa.

25:37.536 --> 25:40.130
It can go home after we make a pond.

25:40.956 --> 25:43.050
This water lives at Mombasa.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.219
Come, then.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.495
I wouldn't run.

27:03.163 --> 27:06.508
If you do, she'll think
you're something good to eat.

27:09.378 --> 27:11.346
Do you have a gun?

27:11.713 --> 27:13.465
She won't like the smell of you.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.225
Shoot it.

27:16.009 --> 27:17.386
She's had breakfast.

27:22.599 --> 27:24.226
Please shoot her.

27:24.434 --> 27:26.402
Let's give her a moment.

27:27.521 --> 27:29.398
Oh, my God, shoot her!

27:39.408 --> 27:42.787
Just how much closer did you
expect to let her come?

27:43.078 --> 27:47.299
A bit. She wanted to see if you'd run.
That's how they decide.

27:47.416 --> 27:48.759
A lot like people that way.

27:48.876 --> 27:50.219
She almost had me for lunch.

27:50.294 --> 27:52.342
It wasn't her fault.
She's a lion.

27:52.421 --> 27:53.513
It wasn't mine.

27:53.589 --> 27:56.263
Doesn't that outfit come with a rifle?

27:56.466 --> 27:58.560
It's on my saddle.

27:58.719 --> 28:01.438
Better keep it with you. Your
horse isn't much of a shot.

28:02.598 --> 28:04.942
For Berkeley.
He's brought you presents.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.690
We stopped by your house and then came looking.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.942
Good Lord, you are sweet.

28:10.814 --> 28:14.193
You're on the road actually. We're
off to Magadi to shoot some ivory.

28:14.276 --> 28:17.325
At least I have something good to offer you.

28:18.405 --> 28:21.625
Did you intend to tell
Berkeley what a fool I was?

28:21.825 --> 28:23.827
She had a lion a bit interested.

28:23.952 --> 28:27.331
A bit?
A bit, but not enough to bite.

28:27.623 --> 28:29.421
It's all right to take a chance

28:30.417 --> 28:31.769
as long as you're the only one who'll pay.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.010
Wouldn't you say so?

28:33.086 --> 28:35.305
I'd say that it sounds more
like something you'd say.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.927
Thank you.
Not at all.

28:37.007 --> 28:38.054
Where's Blix?

28:38.133 --> 28:39.180
Hunting.

28:39.301 --> 28:41.053
Has he been out long?

28:41.136 --> 28:42.308
Yes.

28:43.639 --> 28:46.392
You'll need a good chat then.
Shall we stay for supper?

28:46.475 --> 28:48.273
Blix will have jackets we can use.

28:48.352 --> 28:50.275
Do I have anything to say in this?

28:50.395 --> 28:52.318
Not really, but we'll hear you out.

28:52.522 --> 28:54.195
Then I would like you to stay.

28:54.775 --> 28:55.992
Good.

28:57.819 --> 28:59.821
I don't know. Do you sing?

29:02.199 --> 29:03.542
Never.

29:03.659 --> 29:05.161
Can you tell a story then?

29:05.827 --> 29:07.829
I happen to be very good at stories.

29:09.998 --> 29:11.295
I believe that.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.597
What's happened to the cows'?
For the dairy?

29:16.672 --> 29:20.176
We changed our minds.
We'll grow coffee instead.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.677
A bit risky, this high.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.137
So I've been told.

29:23.303 --> 29:24.555
Didn't seem to bother you.

29:24.638 --> 29:26.436
I think they just haven't tried.

29:27.057 --> 29:30.186
Every time I turn my back,
it wants to go wild again.

29:30.644 --> 29:32.191
It will go wild.

29:37.359 --> 29:38.736
Your man...

29:38.819 --> 29:39.866
Kanuthia.

29:40.362 --> 29:41.614
He's not Kikuyu?

29:42.030 --> 29:43.031
No.

29:44.992 --> 29:46.960
Shall I see that he's given supper?

29:47.035 --> 29:49.629
Don't do anything for him, thank you, Baroness.

29:51.039 --> 29:54.134
It's true of Somalis. The
only tribe that knows horses.

29:54.209 --> 29:58.430
And they don't drink, charge interest,
or chase other men's wives.

30:01.258 --> 30:02.805
Got to go to town for that.

30:06.763 --> 30:08.265
Did you know that in all of literature

30:08.348 --> 30:11.898
there is no poem celebrating the foot?

30:12.269 --> 30:16.991
There's lips, there's eyes,
hands, face, hair, breasts,

30:17.232 --> 30:21.578
legs, arms, even the knees, but not
one verse for the poor old foot.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.916
Why do you think that is?

30:26.074 --> 30:29.578
Priorities, I suppose. Did you
think you would make one?

30:30.537 --> 30:32.505
The problem is, there's
nothing to rhyme it with.

30:32.581 --> 30:33.833
Put.
It's not a noun.

30:33.915 --> 30:35.007
Doesn't matter.

30:35.083 --> 30:39.259
"Along he came and he did put
upon my farm his clumsy foot"

30:41.506 --> 30:42.507
Mmm.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.722
We should have a story now.

30:52.017 --> 30:54.987
When I tell a story to my nieces at home,

30:55.145 --> 30:58.115
one of them always provides the first sentence.

31:00.150 --> 31:01.322
Anything?

31:01.401 --> 31:02.823
Absolutely anything.

31:06.365 --> 31:11.041
There was a wandering Chinese named Cheng Huan

31:13.872 --> 31:16.045
living in Limehouse,

31:16.458 --> 31:19.678
and a girl named Shirley.

31:22.339 --> 31:24.967
Who spoke perfect Chinese,

31:25.300 --> 31:28.304
which she learned from her missionary parents.

31:29.513 --> 31:33.768
Cheng Huan lived alone
in a room on Formosa Street

31:33.850 --> 31:35.898
above the Blue Lantern.

31:38.355 --> 31:40.323
He sat at his window,

31:42.526 --> 31:45.496
and in his poor listening heart

31:46.405 --> 31:49.659
strange echoes of his home and country...

32:18.353 --> 32:20.697
They found them there the next morning,

32:20.772 --> 32:23.025
in their room above the Blue Lantern.

32:23.525 --> 32:25.948
The dead child and the warlord,

32:26.862 --> 32:30.867
with Cheng Huan's love gift
coiled about his neck.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.383
Had you been to those places?

32:39.833 --> 32:43.178
I have been a mental traveler.

32:44.087 --> 32:45.088
Till now.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.172
Yes.

32:46.214 --> 32:49.388
Wasn't this England?
Excuse me, Denmark?

32:50.469 --> 32:52.096
I like my things.

32:52.929 --> 32:55.899
And when you traveled before, in your mind,

32:56.349 --> 32:58.568
did you carry so much luggage?

32:58.977 --> 33:02.151
A mental traveler hasn't
the need to eat or sleep

33:02.898 --> 33:04.775
or entertain.

33:08.236 --> 33:09.579
You're right.

33:10.113 --> 33:13.458
Anyway, aren't you pleased that I
brought my crystal and my china?

33:14.493 --> 33:16.120
And your stories, yes.

33:17.037 --> 33:20.507
The conquering heroes <i>come</i>

33:21.333 --> 33:26.510
<i>Sound the trumpets Beat the drums</i>

33:36.681 --> 33:38.604
But I want you to come often.

33:39.434 --> 33:40.731
I'd like that very much.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.938
And you must promise me it will be soon.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.489
I promise.

33:45.565 --> 33:46.862
Bye.

33:53.406 --> 33:55.408
Did you save my life?

33:56.159 --> 34:00.585
No, the lioness did that.
She walked away.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.254
So I am not indebted then?

34:04.668 --> 34:05.920
But I am.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.514
We pay our storytellers here.

34:13.927 --> 34:15.304
It's lovely.

34:16.972 --> 34:21.853
But my stories are free and
your present's much too clear.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.563
Write them down sometime.

34:32.612 --> 34:34.580
Take care, Finch Hatton.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.496
You wouldn't rather call me Denys?

34:43.831 --> 34:45.425
Baroness.

34:47.377 --> 34:48.674
Goodbye.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.871
What are you doing?

35:25.165 --> 35:27.167
I want you to come home.

35:47.896 --> 35:50.149
We never spoke about children.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.240
Did you...

35:57.405 --> 35:58.622
Do you?

35:59.199 --> 36:00.325
Yes.

36:01.409 --> 36:03.082
Is that all right?

36:22.263 --> 36:24.686
These Kikuyu want to be sick now.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.152
Good Lord!

36:29.521 --> 36:31.398
Your leg has got worse.

36:32.941 --> 36:34.989
You should go to hospital.

36:35.318 --> 36:40.165
This leg may be foolish. It may
think not to go to hospital.

36:42.450 --> 36:45.078
This leg will do as it pleases.

36:45.995 --> 36:48.168
But if you will take it to hospital,

36:48.248 --> 36:50.296
I will think that you are wise.

36:50.583 --> 36:54.554
And such a wise man as this, I
would want to work in my house

36:55.296 --> 36:56.764
for wages.

36:56.965 --> 37:00.219
How much wages would come
to such a wise man as that?

37:03.471 --> 37:06.315
More wages than come from tending goats.

37:08.309 --> 37:10.311
I will speak to this leg.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.275
What about air raids?

37:53.354 --> 37:56.107
Quiet!
One question at a time.

37:56.191 --> 37:58.614
The war's in Europe.
Will it ever reach here?

37:58.693 --> 38:03.119
German East is only 200 miles south.
General Von Lettow is there.

38:03.198 --> 38:05.200
Let's not wait till he joins us at the bar.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.580
Would we engage them?

38:06.659 --> 38:09.913
This is our war. You don't have
to be involved, but thanks.

38:09.996 --> 38:12.670
I've got crops coming in. How
long is this thing gonna last?

38:14.125 --> 38:16.628
We just have to stay and go as we must.

38:16.711 --> 38:19.214
They won't fight if we won't fight.

38:19.506 --> 38:22.430
We could always arm the
Masai and point them south.

38:22.509 --> 38:24.102
Do you want the job of collecting rifles

38:24.177 --> 38:25.929
from the Masai when this is over?

38:26.012 --> 38:29.107
And our women and children?
Shall we bring them into town?

38:29.182 --> 38:31.981
We will deal with that problem as it arises.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.607
Will they use native troops?

38:33.686 --> 38:36.565
I'd assume so, but not Masai!

38:36.898 --> 38:38.900
Berkeley, what about your Somalis?

38:40.068 --> 38:43.493
They'd make very good scouts. We can
cover the area here to the border.

38:43.571 --> 38:46.290
We can gather information
for when the regulars arrive.

38:46.366 --> 38:48.915
What's it about?
Have you any idea?

38:50.495 --> 38:51.496
Not really.

38:51.579 --> 38:53.259
Then why do you want to get into it?

38:53.790 --> 38:55.463
It's got nothing to do with us.

38:55.583 --> 38:58.086
They've made agreements we know nothing about.

38:58.211 --> 39:01.590
Victoria and the Kaiser were
relatives, for God's sake.

39:03.091 --> 39:04.843
They divided Africa between them.

39:04.926 --> 39:06.599
Do you know why there's a border?

39:07.303 --> 39:09.601
'Cause she had two mountains and he had none.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.809
So she gave him Kilimanjaro.

39:12.225 --> 39:15.149
It's a silly argument
between two spoiled countries.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.360
The sooner we do this, the sooner it ends,

39:17.438 --> 39:19.816
the sooner we pick up where we left off.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.740
It may end.

39:25.780 --> 39:28.283
But we're not gonna pick up where we left off.

39:28.408 --> 39:32.083
You don't have to go!
You want to go!

39:32.287 --> 39:34.039
We've got to live here.

39:34.122 --> 39:35.965
They don't want you.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.838
They don't know where we stand.

39:37.917 --> 39:41.547
I'm not so fond of their empire
I'd have you shot for it.

39:41.629 --> 39:43.973
More likely chewed on than shot.

39:44.299 --> 39:47.553
The farm will take care of
itself, and you've got Belknap.

39:47.635 --> 39:50.104
The farm will not take care of itself.

39:50.179 --> 39:51.977
That's not the point.

39:56.644 --> 39:59.147
I didn't expect to like you so much.

40:04.277 --> 40:07.372
You're not going to go falling in love, are you?

40:08.823 --> 40:11.451
Not with someone who's always leaving.

40:14.996 --> 40:18.671
If you need me, send a runner to find Delamere.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.798
That's where I'll be.

40:27.050 --> 40:28.677
That's a fine kiss goodbye.

40:28.801 --> 40:30.599
I'm better at hello.

40:46.986 --> 40:49.580
<i>It's an odd feeling, farewell.</i>

40:51.032 --> 40:53.330
<i>There is some envy in it.</i>

40:54.452 --> 40:58.377
<i>Men go off to be tested for courage.</i>

40:58.706 --> 41:02.552
<i>But if we're tested at all it's for patience,</i>

41:02.627 --> 41:04.425
<i>for doing without,</i>

41:05.296 --> 41:08.891
<i>perhaps for how well we can endure loneliness.</i>

41:09.884 --> 41:12.012
<i>But I had always known that.</i>

41:14.847 --> 41:16.770
<i>It didn't require a war.</i>

41:17.892 --> 41:20.270
<i>I said goodbye to Bror.</i>

41:20.895 --> 41:25.651
<i>Denys left without a word,
which was quite proper.</i>

41:28.903 --> 41:30.496
Hello, the house!

41:34.909 --> 41:37.412
I thought you might want some meat.

41:38.454 --> 41:40.127
Is there any word?

41:40.248 --> 41:42.171
Nothing new.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.628
There's not much fighting.
Awful fever, though.

41:46.421 --> 41:49.095
I've got time for tea, I should think.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.349
Are you for the Germans?

42:01.602 --> 42:04.025
Did they send you out to ask me this?

42:04.105 --> 42:05.948
We had a row about it in town.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.822
Because of my bad English.

42:09.485 --> 42:11.613
And whose side were you on?

42:12.280 --> 42:13.452
Yours.

42:18.953 --> 42:20.671
They want to send me home to school.

42:20.747 --> 42:22.545
Mother says I'm growing up wild.

42:22.790 --> 42:24.292
I wanted to ask you about it.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.422
Me?

42:26.544 --> 42:28.797
You've been around and about.

42:29.714 --> 42:33.139
Some day, I'd like to run
my own show the way you do.

42:34.969 --> 42:36.596
Is that what I do?

42:36.721 --> 42:38.314
You don't seem to need us much.

42:41.809 --> 42:43.811
May I ask you something?

42:45.980 --> 42:48.904
I don't know much about men.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.823
I want them to like me, but I...

42:55.990 --> 42:58.368
I want to be let alone, too.

43:02.622 --> 43:05.546
I'm supposed to want to be taken, aren't I?

43:08.294 --> 43:10.092
I've got this book,

43:12.715 --> 43:15.594
but how do you know when to
do what they want you to

43:15.676 --> 43:18.350
and when not to?

43:23.392 --> 43:25.986
I suppose you ought to call me Karen.

43:41.994 --> 43:45.464
They need paraffin and tinned food.
Enough for 300 men.

43:45.540 --> 43:48.134
He wants you to send a white man with the wagon.

43:48.209 --> 43:49.711
Is he all right?

43:49.794 --> 43:52.513
I assume.
Well enough to send a message.

43:52.880 --> 43:55.599
And where would my husband like this wagon sent?

43:55.675 --> 43:58.303
He's with Delamere on the
border near Lake Natron.

43:58.386 --> 44:00.104
That's confidential, of course.

44:00.221 --> 44:01.939
I would bear that in mind.

44:02.014 --> 44:03.766
Sorry, I only meant

44:03.850 --> 44:06.524
it wouldn't do for it to be talk around Nairobi.

44:06.602 --> 44:08.479
We have to move you into town.

44:08.563 --> 44:10.190
We can't protect you here.

44:11.274 --> 44:12.947
What do you mean, into town?

44:13.025 --> 44:15.448
With the men gone, we're
worried about the natives.

44:15.528 --> 44:17.997
We have orders.
Women and children into town.

44:18.072 --> 44:20.325
That is internment, Lieutenant.

44:20.408 --> 44:22.081
Women and children.

44:23.578 --> 44:25.751
Is that one category or two?

44:25.955 --> 44:28.128
You'll want time to gather your things.

44:28.207 --> 44:30.460
I'll send an escort here for you Thursday.

44:30.543 --> 44:32.295
And I am a captain.

44:37.675 --> 44:39.552
I'm not paid to fight.

44:41.637 --> 44:42.809
No.

44:45.641 --> 44:47.439
Where is Lake Natron?

44:47.727 --> 44:49.775
That's south.
Bush country.

44:50.813 --> 44:52.531
It's no place for a white man.

47:35.936 --> 47:38.780
We should have crossed the Sand River today.

47:39.648 --> 47:41.616
I may have got us lost.

47:42.193 --> 47:43.661
God is great.

48:38.207 --> 48:40.005
What the devil are you doing here?

48:40.167 --> 48:41.965
I'm on my way to Delamere.

48:42.044 --> 48:43.921
Ridiculous.
We don't send women to war.

48:44.004 --> 48:45.301
Well, I'm going.

48:45.381 --> 48:48.351
We haven't time for this.
You don't know where you are.

48:48.426 --> 48:49.427
I do now.

48:49.510 --> 48:50.887
And you'll just get lost again.

48:51.929 --> 48:53.397
I'm going on.

48:54.181 --> 48:55.933
Talk to her, will you?

48:56.058 --> 48:57.105
No.

48:58.561 --> 49:00.655
She could be hurt or worse.

49:00.729 --> 49:02.356
I imagine she knows that.

49:03.524 --> 49:05.071
Right, I tried.

49:11.198 --> 49:12.450
Here.

49:14.368 --> 49:17.872
Find a spot on the horizon
each morning and steer by it.

49:18.080 --> 49:19.707
South-southwest.

49:20.207 --> 49:21.880
About three days.

49:22.460 --> 49:23.552
I see.

49:24.545 --> 49:27.549
And don't worry about us, we'll be all right.

50:19.767 --> 50:20.893
What is it?

50:20.976 --> 50:22.068
Masai.

52:08.250 --> 52:11.595
Ismail, my rifle, where's my rifle'?

52:39.573 --> 52:40.870
Get away!

53:42.094 --> 53:45.598
<i>Msabu's</i> bleeding.
She does not have this ox.

53:47.516 --> 53:49.518
This lion is hungry.

53:50.394 --> 53:52.647
He does not have this ox.

53:54.273 --> 53:58.403
This wagon is heavy.
It doesn't have this ox.

54:00.237 --> 54:03.958
God is happy.
He plays with us.

54:15.377 --> 54:17.345
Tell Blix his wife's here.

55:01.465 --> 55:02.682
Hello, Karen.

55:03.634 --> 55:06.308
Hello, D. Hello, Bror.

55:07.137 --> 55:09.356
I've brought you some things.

55:10.974 --> 55:12.976
You've changed your hair.

55:15.312 --> 55:16.734
You needed supplies...

55:16.814 --> 55:18.191
Send someone, I said.

55:18.273 --> 55:21.618
You were lucky to get through.
It was really foolish.

55:21.693 --> 55:23.570
But I did get through.

55:25.155 --> 55:26.702
And it was fun.

55:32.204 --> 55:34.206
When are you coming home?

55:37.417 --> 55:38.839
Not just yet.

55:41.004 --> 55:44.474
You're not going to help at
all with the farm, are you?

55:46.802 --> 55:48.019
No.

55:48.470 --> 55:51.974
I could force you.
I could cut you off.

55:53.392 --> 55:55.645
I'll just hunt professionally.

55:57.521 --> 55:59.319
I might do it anyway.

56:03.735 --> 56:06.534
It's not the way we thought it would be,

56:08.657 --> 56:09.909
is it?

56:17.875 --> 56:20.674
But I like it that you're honest with me.

56:21.753 --> 56:23.380
I like you, too.

56:32.014 --> 56:33.357
Very much.

57:11.803 --> 57:14.181
<i>I had a compass from Denys.</i>

57:14.848 --> 57:16.850
<i>"To steer by," he said.</i>

57:17.768 --> 57:19.941
<i>But later it came to me</i>

57:20.020 --> 57:22.990
<i>that we navigated differently.</i>

57:25.150 --> 57:29.200
<i>Perhaps he knew, as I did not,</i>

57:30.280 --> 57:32.624
<i>that the Earth was made round</i>

57:32.950 --> 57:36.875
<i>so that we would not see too far down the road.</i>

58:08.318 --> 58:10.070
You've got syphilis.

58:15.909 --> 58:17.707
That's not possible.

58:19.913 --> 58:21.915
Your husband is not ill?

58:26.586 --> 58:27.587
No.

58:29.006 --> 58:31.054
Not the last time I saw him.

58:32.300 --> 58:34.428
That was three months ago.

58:37.973 --> 58:39.646
He's on the border with Delamere.

58:39.725 --> 58:41.272
He would have come home.

58:41.435 --> 58:43.108
These cases vary.

58:44.479 --> 58:46.481
He may have just a touch.

58:48.400 --> 58:50.152
But you are very ill.

58:59.327 --> 59:01.455
Is he the only possibility?

59:04.458 --> 59:05.550
Yes.

59:06.334 --> 59:09.463
You'll have to go home
to deal with it, you know?

59:09.546 --> 59:13.847
The treatment's difficult, but they
have a thing called Salvarsan.

59:14.634 --> 59:15.806
Arsenic.

59:18.805 --> 59:24.653
And if I'm not cured then I
will be insane, won't I?

59:24.728 --> 59:26.526
You ought to go soon.

59:28.398 --> 59:30.492
I'll have to see your husband.

59:34.821 --> 59:36.368
I will send for him.

59:36.490 --> 59:39.915
These ought to help with the
fever till you get home.

59:48.502 --> 59:50.345
And what are my chances?

59:51.004 --> 59:52.927
About even, I'm afraid.

01:00:03.683 --> 01:00:06.562
It's not what I thought would happen to me now.

01:00:22.828 --> 01:00:24.000
Muthaiga?

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:27.215
What?
Your letters.

01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:37.717
Excuse me.

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:44.350
I heard you had made it. I'd have
paid anything to see their faces.

01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:46.727
Hello.

01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:48.979
Would you join us for a drink?

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:51.736
I can't.
How is it that you are home?

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.905
I brought Berkeley back.

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:55.485
Has he been wounded?

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:56.570
No, fever.

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:58.214
More than usual, but he'll be all right

01:00:58.238 --> 01:00:59.911
as long <i>as</i> the gin holds out.

01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:04.415
And you?
How is it with the fighting?

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:09.925
We're taking a beating. It's
likely to last for a while.

01:01:13.253 --> 01:01:14.846
I still have your compass.

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:16.715
Why don't you keep it?

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:19.718
You've earned it.

01:01:20.552 --> 01:01:24.273
Besides, I don't always want to
know where I'm going anyway.

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:31.856
Please don't let me keep you.

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:36.659
Are you all right?

01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:37.994
Yes.

01:01:38.445 --> 01:01:39.992
Take good care.

01:01:41.823 --> 01:01:43.075
We're behind a story or two.

01:01:43.325 --> 01:01:45.544
Yes. When I get back.

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:46.791
Back? From where?

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:49.506
When you get back, I meant.

01:01:51.833 --> 01:01:54.552
I thought it was malaria.
It wasn't.

01:01:57.422 --> 01:02:00.642
And you may be all right,
but you have to be seen.

01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:06.599
And the others, whoever they
are, I hope they've got it.

01:02:08.016 --> 01:02:11.691
It's my fault, no one else's.

01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:18.860
I want to go with you.

01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:21.830
Someone has to stay here and run things,

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:24.078
and the factory must be finished.

01:02:26.368 --> 01:02:27.369
Can you do that?

01:02:27.452 --> 01:02:28.749
That's little enough.

01:02:44.135 --> 01:02:45.478
I'm sorry.

01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:54.111
I'm sorry.

01:03:02.404 --> 01:03:04.031
<i>Where's memsahib?</i>

01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:06.658
She can come soon enough.

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:18.716
<i>Later that day, I left for Mombasa</i>

01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:22.349
<i>and the voyage home to Denmark.</i>

01:03:24.259 --> 01:03:26.728
<i>It was a longer journey this time.</i>

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:30.227
<i>The war went on.</i>

01:03:30.724 --> 01:03:32.943
<i>I fought my own war.</i>

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:38.611
<i>Arsenic was my ally
against an enemy I never saw.</i>

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:45.705
<i>I stayed in the room where I was born</i>

01:03:46.197 --> 01:03:47.949
<i>in Rungstedlund</i>

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:51.419
<i>and tried to remember the colors of Africa.</i>

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:06.263
<i>There was only the medicine</i>

01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:11.432
<i>and walks with my mother along
a deserted stretch of beach</i>

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:15.693
<i>and this room in my mother's house.</i>

01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:21.779
<i>Denmark had become a stranger to me</i>

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:23.861
<i>and I to her.</i>

01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:27.997
<i>But my mother's house, I came to know again.</i>

01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:34.292
<i>And knew I would come back to it, sick or well,</i>

01:04:35.121 --> 01:04:37.499
<i>sane or mad, someday.</i>

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:40.919
<i>And so I did,</i>

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:43.133
<i>after Tsavo.</i>

01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:37.980
Almost everyone's got them now.

01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:53.142
I am cooking now.

01:06:53.218 --> 01:06:55.061
I have heard about this.

01:07:07.315 --> 01:07:08.783
Are you well?

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:12.575
I am well enough.

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:15.289
Then I am well enough also.

01:07:18.326 --> 01:07:19.703
What will you do?

01:07:19.786 --> 01:07:23.165
I have been thinking I'll hunt.
Safari sort of thing.

01:07:23.623 --> 01:07:27.173
They say it'll be quite a
business once the war <i>is</i> over.

01:07:28.086 --> 01:07:30.180
You wouldn't want to teach?

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:33.971
I would like these Kikuyu to have a school.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:37.808
There will be a fight about that.

01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:47.067
Are you all well?

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.278
They say I'm cured.

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:53.945
I won't have children.

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:04.627
Have you thought about us?

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:09.335
Of course.

01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:24.270
Belknap says the coffee will
flower after the next rains.

01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:30.111
If it does, you'll have to start
thinking about hiring for the harvest

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:32.863
and how you'll get to market.

01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:48.024
Where would Berkeley be?

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.478
He must be here.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.578
Who won the match?

01:10:11.249 --> 01:10:13.343
Have you got a story for me?

01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:16.463
Finch Hatton.

01:10:17.839 --> 01:10:20.638
I've been demoted.
I was Denys last time.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.303
Would you care for some champagne?

01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:26.977
They said you went home for a while.

01:10:28.099 --> 01:10:29.191
Yes.

01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:31.061
Where's Berkeley?

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:32.487
It's good to see you.

01:10:36.941 --> 01:10:40.821
He's still down with fever. He'll be
all right. Who are all these people?

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:44.957
Bror says we'll be a colony soon.

01:10:46.617 --> 01:10:48.619
They want it settled now.

01:10:49.203 --> 01:10:52.878
They've got a lottery. "Buy a
ticket, win a farm in Africa."

01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:55.752
Did you really think it
would stay the way it was'?

01:10:57.962 --> 01:10:59.680
I thought it might.

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:03.427
Where is Kanuthia?

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:05.178
He's dead.

01:11:12.059 --> 01:11:15.029
How are you?
Would you join us for a drink?

01:11:17.148 --> 01:11:19.071
It's time to find a pillow.

01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:21.403
Another night then?

01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:28.042
Have a good Christmas.

01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:30.749
Christmas?

01:11:32.038 --> 01:11:33.290
So it is.

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:07.741
This Chief says children higher than this

01:12:07.907 --> 01:12:09.955
must not learn to read.

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:14.668
Tell him that all the
children must go to school.

01:12:14.747 --> 01:12:19.093
No, this is a Chief.
You are not a Chief.

01:12:19.418 --> 01:12:20.510
That's absurd.

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:24.261
It is not good for tall people
to Know more than this Chief.

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:28.936
When these children are tall,
then this Chief can be dead.

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:08.518
Bror, yes. But Denys hired out
to tourists, I can't imagine.

01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:10.978
He's got no other trade and we've got no choice.

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:13.147
The government's put a stop to the ivory.

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:14.895
What will you do then?

01:13:14.974 --> 01:13:16.647
I'll concentrate on the farm.

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:18.319
Hello, the house!

01:13:20.104 --> 01:13:21.447
How is it you're home?

01:13:21.522 --> 01:13:25.993
I'm out. Look. I didn't learn a
thing, but I'm wonderfully clean.

01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:30.998
I'll come and see you. You
save me a dance, Berkeley.

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:42.047
What's this nonsense I hear about a school?

01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:43.969
I've taken on a young missionary.

01:13:44.211 --> 01:13:47.636
He's promised me to do the alphabet
first, and save God for later.

01:13:47.715 --> 01:13:50.138
Wogs can't even count their goats.

01:13:50.468 --> 01:13:52.641
It's none of your bloody business anyway!

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.563
Who the devil are you?

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:02.613
I wonder if you'd dance with me?

01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:07.031
I think you are about to apologize.

01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:12.414
You do stir things up.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:18.045
When they said they'd like to read,

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.667
how did they put that exactly?

01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:21.545
Do they know they'd like Dickens?

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:23.547
You don't think they should learn to read?

01:14:23.668 --> 01:14:25.591
I think you might have asked them.

01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:27.968
Did you ask to learn when you were a child?

01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:30.345
How can stories possibly harm them?

01:14:30.424 --> 01:14:32.927
They have their own stories,
just not in writing.

01:14:33.052 --> 01:14:35.601
Why would you rather keep them ignorant?

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.478
They're not ignorant.

01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:41.186
I just don't think they should be
turned into little Englishmen.

01:14:46.941 --> 01:14:48.659
You do like to change things, don't you?

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:50.736
For the better, I hope.

01:14:51.696 --> 01:14:54.119
I want my Kikuyu to learn to read.

01:14:55.032 --> 01:14:58.536
My Kikuyu.
My Limoges. My farm.

01:14:58.619 --> 01:15:00.121
It's an awful lot to own, isn't it?

01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:02.206
I've paid a price for all I own.

01:15:02.289 --> 01:15:04.633
What is it exactly that's yours?

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:09.388
We're not owners here,
we're just passing through.

01:15:11.298 --> 01:15:13.926
Is life really so damn simple for you?

01:15:15.302 --> 01:15:17.896
Perhaps I ask <i>less</i> of it than you do.

01:15:18.723 --> 01:15:20.396
I don't believe that at all.

01:15:20.474 --> 01:15:22.101
Happy New Year!

01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:43.808
Happy New Year.

01:16:44.725 --> 01:16:46.648
And for you, too.

01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:08.834
Someone has left her underclothes in the back.

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:18.551
I want you to take a place in town.

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:26.229
Are you sure?

01:17:49.081 --> 01:17:50.253
Eats.

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:57.844
He eats.

01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:59.182
Elephant.

01:18:27.286 --> 01:18:28.754
Give me work.

01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:14.504
We've got peace, where is the prosperity?

01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:16.585
Why should the prices fall now

01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:18.387
just because they're not killing anybody?

01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:21.048
Tea's down just as bad.

01:19:24.343 --> 01:19:26.687
Do they always have to whip them so?

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:59.546
They finally made a machine
that's really useful. Listen.

01:20:04.258 --> 01:20:05.726
It's for you.

01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:08.596
I can't accept it.

01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:10.431
Why not?

01:20:10.514 --> 01:20:12.141
Bror's moved to town.

01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:15.736
That's a private matter, I imagine.

01:20:25.904 --> 01:20:28.032
Did you think you would spend the night?

01:20:28.115 --> 01:20:31.415
Can't, thanks.
I have to go down to the Mara.

01:20:34.163 --> 01:20:37.508
I've taken up safari work
and I've gotta find a camp.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:42.429
No.

01:20:42.963 --> 01:20:46.934
There's country there you ought to see.
It won't last long now.

01:20:48.635 --> 01:20:50.808
I would be wasting your time.

01:20:51.764 --> 01:20:53.687
Why don't you get your things?

01:20:56.477 --> 01:20:58.479
If you like me at all,

01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:01.319
don't ask me to do this.

01:22:22.521 --> 01:22:24.194
What's your word?

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:27.447
Shoo?

01:22:29.695 --> 01:22:31.368
Is that it? Shoo?

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:44.673
That's a fine word you've got there.

01:22:54.386 --> 01:22:55.854
Crank it again, please.

01:22:57.014 --> 01:22:59.108
Almost. Crank it again.

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:09.243
Once more.

01:23:15.699 --> 01:23:17.451
Well done. We're off.

01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:26.840
I don't know the scientific <i>basis</i> for it,

01:23:26.919 --> 01:23:28.796
but I know you can see further

01:23:28.879 --> 01:23:31.883
in the African night than any other place.

01:23:34.593 --> 01:23:36.641
And the stars are brighter.

01:23:41.308 --> 01:23:43.151
It's about the tents.

01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:46.063
When I'm out with Kanuthia...

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:50.238
Used to be, we didn't use them.

01:23:51.652 --> 01:23:53.746
I remember him.

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.577
There was something...

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:57.832
Masai.

01:23:58.951 --> 01:24:01.249
He was half Masai, that's
what you remember about him.

01:24:02.579 --> 01:24:04.581
They're like nobody else.

01:24:05.666 --> 01:24:09.341
We think we'll tame them, but we won't.

01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:12.886
If you put them in prison, they die.

01:24:14.007 --> 01:24:15.224
Why?

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:19.146
Because they live now. They
don't think about the future.

01:24:20.806 --> 01:24:24.481
They can't grasp the idea that
they'll be let out one clay.

01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:28.481
They think it's permanent, so they die.

01:24:31.650 --> 01:24:34.449
They're the only ones here
that don't care about us,

01:24:34.528 --> 01:24:36.951
and that is what will finish them.

01:24:39.366 --> 01:24:42.495
What did the two of you ever find to talk about?

01:24:44.705 --> 01:24:45.922
Nothing.

01:24:52.546 --> 01:24:55.345
So you knew I would come.

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:05.894
It's an early day tomorrow.
Why don't you get some sleep?

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:09.692
What happens tomorrow?

01:25:10.022 --> 01:25:11.319
I have no idea.

01:25:17.112 --> 01:25:18.614
Good night.

01:25:58.779 --> 01:26:00.497
You would think they would run off.

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:02.912
You didn't.

01:26:32.396 --> 01:26:36.367
Think of that. Never a man-made
sound, and then Mozart.

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:11.060
Have you clients already?

01:27:11.143 --> 01:27:14.272
In a week.
A man from Belgium and his daughters.

01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:17.862
His letter said, "We'd
like three of everything."

01:27:17.941 --> 01:27:19.784
It'll be an interesting trip.

01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:22.955
I'll be gone a month, or an hour and a half.

01:27:24.531 --> 01:27:26.533
Why are you doing this?

01:27:27.367 --> 01:27:29.210
I don't know how to sow.

01:27:46.845 --> 01:27:49.598
Do you know what they're made of?
Cloth.

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:52.692
Where will he land?
Trick is not to.

01:27:57.647 --> 01:27:59.490
It must feel amazing.

01:28:04.404 --> 01:28:07.374
It's how I imagined America to be.

01:28:08.366 --> 01:28:09.743
Have you been to America?

01:28:09.826 --> 01:28:11.794
No, but my father was there,

01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:16.046
and he always told me stories about
it when I was a little girl.

01:28:17.042 --> 01:28:18.419
Are you still close?

01:28:18.502 --> 01:28:22.473
He died. He killed himself
when I was 10 years old.

01:28:46.404 --> 01:28:47.906
I can fix that, I think.

01:28:48.114 --> 01:28:51.493
"Laugh'd loud and long, and all the while

01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:54.087
"His eyes went to and fro

01:28:54.955 --> 01:28:58.801
"'Ha! ha!' quoth he, 'full plain I see

01:28:59.626 --> 01:29:02.220
"'The Devil knows how to row'

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:05.845
"Farewell, farewell!"

01:29:05.924 --> 01:29:07.176
You're skipping verses.

01:29:07.259 --> 01:29:08.932
I leave out the dull parts.

01:29:09.719 --> 01:29:14.691
"Farewell, farewell! but this I
tell To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!"

01:29:14.766 --> 01:29:16.268
Lay your head back.

01:29:18.311 --> 01:29:21.155
"He prayeth well, who loveth well

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:25.570
"Both man and bird and beast"

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:37.923
That's better.

01:29:39.749 --> 01:29:41.877
Will it be so different,

01:29:42.294 --> 01:29:44.137
hunting for hire?

01:29:44.296 --> 01:29:47.800
Not for the animals.
Well, maybe for the animals.

01:29:48.758 --> 01:29:51.432
Do you really prefer them to people?

01:29:51.511 --> 01:29:52.637
Sometimes.

01:29:53.471 --> 01:29:55.815
They don't do anything half-heartedly.

01:29:55.932 --> 01:29:58.151
Everything's for the first time.

01:29:58.268 --> 01:30:00.646
Hunting, working, mating.

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:03.903
It's only man that does it badly.

01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:06.280
It's only man that tires of going through it.

01:30:07.944 --> 01:30:12.199
Who says, "See here.
I know how you feel about me

01:30:12.282 --> 01:30:14.910
"and you know how I feel about you.

01:30:16.661 --> 01:30:21.508
"We understand each other, so let's
lie down and get on with it."

01:30:30.508 --> 01:30:32.010
Why am I here?

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:37.690
Because I wanted you to see all this.

01:30:40.644 --> 01:30:42.692
I wanted to show it to you.

01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:45.615
I thought you'd understand it.

01:30:50.862 --> 01:30:52.614
Do you think much about death?

01:30:53.365 --> 01:30:55.208
I think about getting old.

01:30:57.619 --> 01:31:01.169
It'd be like living with a
cranky demanding old bastard.

01:31:02.374 --> 01:31:05.548
You are a cranky demanding old bastard.

01:31:12.842 --> 01:31:14.389
I had syphilis.

01:31:20.934 --> 01:31:22.857
That's why I went home.

01:31:26.106 --> 01:31:27.358
I know.

01:31:30.193 --> 01:31:34.118
I never seem to get anything.
German measles once.

01:31:38.702 --> 01:31:41.421
They say I'll have a normal life now.

01:31:43.123 --> 01:31:44.750
But no children.

01:31:47.585 --> 01:31:49.132
So the school.

01:31:53.383 --> 01:31:54.885
So the school.

01:31:56.428 --> 01:31:58.931
The farm, that's what I am now.

01:32:00.682 --> 01:32:01.729
No.

01:32:11.776 --> 01:32:14.450
We'll need meat for the camp tomorrow.

01:32:15.947 --> 01:32:17.699
I'll wake you at dawn.

01:32:25.123 --> 01:32:26.466
Good night.

01:32:41.056 --> 01:32:43.229
We might scare up a gazelle or two.

01:32:43.475 --> 01:32:45.728
But we'll be going through
buffalo country again.

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:48.154
They get cocky when you're on foot.

01:34:08.643 --> 01:34:11.613
Supper. Good size, but...

01:34:22.657 --> 01:34:23.783
Lion.

01:34:26.286 --> 01:34:28.539
Careful, the Wind's behind us.

01:35:29.724 --> 01:35:31.852
Back up. Slowly.

01:35:46.532 --> 01:35:50.628
If there's a charge, drop
flat, and let me do it.

01:36:19.148 --> 01:36:20.195
Drop!

01:36:34.205 --> 01:36:35.582
Reload now!

01:37:13.745 --> 01:37:15.418
Dinner in a while?

01:37:18.374 --> 01:37:20.047
I'm glad you came.

01:38:49.674 --> 01:38:51.551
To rose-lipt maidens.

01:39:00.476 --> 01:39:03.320
There was a very young girl from Denmark

01:39:04.564 --> 01:39:07.909
who took passage on a steamer bound for Suez.

01:39:10.862 --> 01:39:12.660
There was a storm

01:39:14.157 --> 01:39:15.750
off Morocco

01:39:18.911 --> 01:39:23.041
and she was washed ashore onto a beach.

01:39:29.046 --> 01:39:30.798
Onto a white beach.

01:39:40.475 --> 01:39:42.898
Onto a beach so white...

01:40:24.894 --> 01:40:26.692
I'd like to do that.

01:40:38.241 --> 01:40:39.788
Will that hurt?

01:40:49.835 --> 01:40:51.803
If you say anything now,

01:40:53.047 --> 01:40:54.424
I'll believe it.

01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:21.580
I need to know how to think about this.

01:41:23.995 --> 01:41:25.087
Why?

01:42:03.034 --> 01:42:06.083
Clear soup, the new lettuce,

01:42:06.203 --> 01:42:08.456
chicken, just the breast.

01:42:11.083 --> 01:42:13.302
I trust this meets with your approval.

01:42:13.377 --> 01:42:15.095
Who is coming?

01:42:15.171 --> 01:42:16.263
<i>Bwana Cole is coming.</i>

01:42:16.339 --> 01:42:18.433
I will think on Bwana Cole.

01:42:28.559 --> 01:42:31.108
I've got myself in real trouble now.

01:42:31.228 --> 01:42:32.605
Now you think they should vote?

01:42:32.688 --> 01:42:33.780
No, worse.

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:37.572
Denys?

01:42:50.206 --> 01:42:51.583
Get Kamante.

01:42:53.584 --> 01:42:55.678
He is out of hand entirely.

01:43:04.095 --> 01:43:06.314
Does this look like a chicken?

01:43:08.224 --> 01:43:11.819
Here is not a chicken, here is a fish.

01:43:14.271 --> 01:43:15.568
Go away.

01:43:21.862 --> 01:43:22.988
What do you think?

01:43:24.323 --> 01:43:26.746
Well, I think it's quite good, isn't it?

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:30.463
Be careful.

01:43:34.208 --> 01:43:36.552
When the old mapmakers
got to the edge of the world,

01:43:36.627 --> 01:43:40.473
they used to write, “Beyond
this place, there be dragons."

01:43:41.215 --> 01:43:42.967
Is that where I am?

01:43:45.469 --> 01:43:47.767
He likes to give presents,

01:43:48.639 --> 01:43:50.357
but not at Christmas.

01:43:52.143 --> 01:43:54.987
He hasn't even said when he's coming again.

01:43:55.688 --> 01:43:57.486
If he's coming again.

01:43:59.734 --> 01:44:01.407
Would you divorce?

01:44:02.486 --> 01:44:04.488
Then I would have no one.

01:45:19.855 --> 01:45:23.530
Men who missed moose in
Alaska, grizzly in America,

01:45:23.609 --> 01:45:27.204
tigers in India, they're all
at sea now bound for here.

01:45:29.365 --> 01:45:33.040
Berkeley is going to farm.
You could do that.

01:45:34.245 --> 01:45:35.747
No, thank you.

01:45:37.706 --> 01:45:41.711
You ought to look in on him though.
He didn't look all that well.

01:45:50.261 --> 01:45:51.763
Can you stay?

01:45:56.267 --> 01:45:57.860
For a day or so.

01:45:59.603 --> 01:46:00.650
Is that all right?

01:46:00.729 --> 01:46:01.855
No.

01:46:05.442 --> 01:46:07.615
You don't need two guns on safari.

01:46:07.945 --> 01:46:11.700
Then do the town work. Meet
the clients, do outfitting.

01:46:11.782 --> 01:46:13.625
There's the mail.
Lots of mail.

01:46:13.701 --> 01:46:15.795
I don't know if I'd be right for that.

01:46:16.453 --> 01:46:18.501
You've gotta do something.

01:46:19.290 --> 01:46:23.215
I don't actually.
My water's gone black.

01:46:29.842 --> 01:46:33.563
We've gotta get you to a hospital,
and get you some proper care.

01:46:35.848 --> 01:46:38.067
I'm being cared for properly.

01:46:52.948 --> 01:46:54.700
It's some years now.

01:46:56.118 --> 01:46:58.166
She's fond of me, I think.

01:47:02.374 --> 01:47:04.342
Why didn't you tell me?

01:47:04.877 --> 01:47:08.051
I suppose I thought...

01:47:11.342 --> 01:47:13.561
I didn't know you well enough.

01:47:18.349 --> 01:47:19.989
There's money left in the trading account.

01:47:20.059 --> 01:47:23.279
I'd like my share to go to Mariammo.

01:47:23.354 --> 01:47:24.981
Berkeley, listen.

01:47:25.564 --> 01:47:29.489
George Martin had blackwater fever
and that was five years now.

01:47:30.194 --> 01:47:32.947
You might take along that
twelve-bore you're so fond of.

01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:35.078
The trigger seems a bit...

01:47:35.866 --> 01:47:39.712
And the Rigby, get Karen to try the Rigby.
It's a nice size gun for her.

01:47:54.468 --> 01:47:56.971
Would you like me to take you home?

01:47:58.389 --> 01:48:00.562
I am home, I suppose.

01:48:01.433 --> 01:48:02.480
"F."

01:48:04.853 --> 01:48:06.321
"G."

01:48:08.232 --> 01:48:09.825
"G" for girl.

01:48:15.155 --> 01:48:16.748
Are you packed?

01:48:17.574 --> 01:48:18.746
Yes.

01:48:19.785 --> 01:48:21.378
How was town?

01:48:22.454 --> 01:48:23.797
Crowded.

01:48:28.752 --> 01:48:30.504
I've been thinking.

01:48:32.297 --> 01:48:36.473
With all the safari work I have
little use for the room at the club.

01:48:43.225 --> 01:48:46.729
I don't know that I'd be any good at this,

01:48:47.771 --> 01:48:51.821
but how would it be if I
kept a few things with you?

01:48:58.115 --> 01:49:00.618
You would come and go from my house?

01:49:02.286 --> 01:49:04.038
If that's all right.

01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:10.170
When the gods want to punish
you they answer your prayers.

01:49:20.054 --> 01:49:21.681
Berkeley's dying.

01:49:24.349 --> 01:49:26.477
What?
Blackwater fever.

01:49:27.644 --> 01:49:29.237
Oh, my God.

01:49:30.147 --> 01:49:32.775
I'll go to him.
He wouldn't want you there.

01:49:34.193 --> 01:49:35.240
Why?

01:49:37.196 --> 01:49:40.291
There's a woman there.
She's Somali.

01:49:42.659 --> 01:49:45.082
She's been with him for some time.

01:49:45.913 --> 01:49:47.836
You never told me this.

01:49:50.209 --> 01:49:51.711
I didn't know.

01:50:10.687 --> 01:50:14.692
"...with each one of us
now and forevermore." Amen.

01:50:37.214 --> 01:50:39.433
Strange that Denys isn't here.

01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:43.604
I think he is off with Berkeley.

01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:56.575
<i>In the days and hours that Denys was at home,</i>

01:50:57.568 --> 01:50:59.912
<i>we spoke of nothing ordinary.</i>

01:51:01.321 --> 01:51:03.699
<i>Not of my troubles with the farm,</i>

01:51:04.658 --> 01:51:07.787
<i>my notes due and my failing crop,</i>

01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:10.714
<i>or of his with his work,</i>

01:51:11.248 --> 01:51:13.876
<i>what he knew was happening to Africa.</i>

01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:21.642
<i>Or of anything at all that was small and real.</i>

01:51:22.968 --> 01:51:26.222
<i>We lived disconnected</i>

01:51:26.889 --> 01:51:28.983
<i>and apart from things.</i>

01:51:30.767 --> 01:51:33.816
<i>I had been making up stories while he was away.</i>

01:51:34.688 --> 01:51:38.067
<i>In the evenings, he made himself comfortable,</i>

01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:42.030
<i>spreading cushions like a
couch in front of the fire,</i>

01:51:43.113 --> 01:51:47.414
<i>and with me sitting cross-legged
like Scherazade herself,</i>

01:51:48.202 --> 01:51:53.003
<i>he would listen clear-eyed to a long tale,</i>

01:51:53.790 --> 01:51:57.044
<i>from when it began until it ended.</i>

01:52:39.211 --> 01:52:40.679
Where did you get it?

01:52:41.171 --> 01:52:42.673
Mombasa.

01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:44.683
Get in.

01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:51.932
When did you learn to fly?

01:52:52.849 --> 01:52:54.647
Yesterday.

01:56:00.328 --> 01:56:01.671
Don't move.

01:56:08.879 --> 01:56:10.426
I want to move.

01:56:12.132 --> 01:56:13.384
Don't move.

01:56:40.243 --> 01:56:41.711
Hello, Denys.

01:56:46.082 --> 01:56:47.584
May I see you?

01:56:54.674 --> 01:56:56.426
I'm broke, too, you know?

01:56:56.510 --> 01:57:00.060
I wouldn't ask, but tips were a bit light.

01:57:03.808 --> 01:57:05.355
Are you all right?

01:57:05.435 --> 01:57:06.937
If I get a decent crop.

01:57:09.523 --> 01:57:11.241
I could shoot him.

01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:18.540
I've got this terrible urge to kiss you.

01:57:21.910 --> 01:57:24.959
He's smarter than I am.
It may go well.

01:57:27.749 --> 01:57:29.046
Good luck.

01:57:42.222 --> 01:57:43.769
You might have asked.

01:57:44.140 --> 01:57:45.562
I did.

01:57:46.977 --> 01:57:48.399
She said yes.

01:58:02.242 --> 01:58:05.462
If I get eaten up sometime
bury me here, will you?

01:58:06.162 --> 01:58:07.789
Whatever's left.

01:58:08.373 --> 01:58:10.922
Just there at the crest of the hill.

01:58:17.090 --> 01:58:18.592
When are you leaving?

01:58:19.342 --> 01:58:20.639
Tomorrow.

01:58:22.554 --> 01:58:25.933
Doesn't it matter to you
that I'm another man's wife?

01:58:27.267 --> 01:58:30.237
What matters to me is that you tried so hard.

01:58:33.064 --> 01:58:34.816
What time tomorrow?

01:58:45.118 --> 01:58:46.665
Goodbye again.

01:58:48.079 --> 01:58:49.706
How many acres under cultivation?

01:58:49.789 --> 01:58:50.915
Five hundred.

01:58:50.999 --> 01:58:52.717
The rest of it's wild?

01:58:53.084 --> 01:58:54.882
The Kikuyu live there.

01:58:55.587 --> 01:58:57.464
Why don't you move them off?

01:58:58.131 --> 01:59:00.008
Because they live there.

01:59:00.842 --> 01:59:03.311
We'll take it over should you default.

01:59:06.806 --> 01:59:07.978
We've got another year.

01:59:08.058 --> 01:59:09.401
God is great.

01:59:09.476 --> 01:59:11.023
He's charging 3%.

01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:26.660
This Chief says, "Tall children
can come to school now."

01:59:35.418 --> 01:59:40.675
Tell Chief Kinanjui that
reading is a valuable thing.

01:59:41.341 --> 01:59:43.890
His children will remember him well.

01:59:59.275 --> 02:00:00.697
This Chief says,

02:00:00.777 --> 02:00:03.906
"British can read and what
good has it done them?"

02:01:34.871 --> 02:01:37.841
Miss Felicity's Spurway.
Clear round.

02:01:38.208 --> 02:01:39.755
She's quite something, that Felicity.

02:01:39.834 --> 02:01:41.427
Yes, indeed.

02:01:44.047 --> 02:01:48.894
The next competitor, Mr. John Sutton on Castano.

02:01:51.179 --> 02:01:52.897
How are you?

02:01:53.139 --> 02:01:54.891
Getting old, I think.

02:01:56.226 --> 02:01:57.273
Not you.

02:01:58.561 --> 02:02:00.063
How is the hunting?

02:02:00.230 --> 02:02:02.699
I'll make a living.
Where's Denys?

02:02:03.733 --> 02:02:06.577
Uganda. Some potentate.

02:02:08.947 --> 02:02:12.076
I thought you might be wanting a divorce.

02:02:17.163 --> 02:02:20.758
Has she got money?
Of course she's got money.

02:02:23.169 --> 02:02:25.137
Is this important, Bror?

02:02:26.130 --> 02:02:27.473
I suppose.

02:02:28.591 --> 02:02:31.310
I'll have to accuse you of something,

02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:36.441
or did you think you would
have it the other way around?

02:02:37.267 --> 02:02:40.612
Fire away, whatever.
I have surely done it.

02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:45.783
Thank you.

02:02:46.526 --> 02:02:50.451
How do you manage it?
To keep us friends'?

02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:52.623
We started that way.

02:02:56.286 --> 02:02:59.290
I'll be happy for you, if I can.

02:03:07.422 --> 02:03:09.470
I remember that quite well.

02:03:33.531 --> 02:03:35.784
<i>When you go away on safari,</i>

02:03:36.618 --> 02:03:38.541
are you ever with someone else?

02:03:38.661 --> 02:03:41.665
I'd be with you if I wanted to be with anyone.

02:03:43.708 --> 02:03:45.130
Do you ever get lonely?

02:03:45.209 --> 02:03:46.426
Sometimes.

02:03:47.170 --> 02:03:49.172
Do you ever wonder if I am lonely'?

02:03:51.049 --> 02:03:52.471
No, I don't.

02:03:53.843 --> 02:03:56.016
Do you think about me at all?

02:03:56.846 --> 02:03:58.018
Often.

02:03:58.389 --> 02:04:00.517
But not enough to come back.

02:04:02.226 --> 02:04:05.355
I do come back, all the time.
What is it?

02:04:06.856 --> 02:04:08.028
Nothing.

02:04:15.281 --> 02:04:17.158
Bror has asked me for a divorce.

02:04:17.241 --> 02:04:19.460
He's found someone that he wants to marry.

02:04:19.661 --> 02:04:22.460
I just thought we might do that some day.

02:04:23.456 --> 02:04:24.708
Divorce?

02:04:29.629 --> 02:04:31.973
How would a wedding change things?

02:04:32.048 --> 02:04:34.392
I would have someone of my own.

02:04:37.095 --> 02:04:38.563
You wouldn't.

02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:42.563
What's wrong with marriage anyway?

02:04:42.892 --> 02:04:44.394
Have you ever seen one you admire?

02:04:44.477 --> 02:04:46.150
Yes, I have. Many.

02:04:50.024 --> 02:04:51.697
Belfields, for one.

02:04:52.151 --> 02:04:54.779
He sent her home for the rains in 1910.

02:04:55.071 --> 02:04:57.290
Didn't tell her they were over until 1913.

02:04:57.407 --> 02:05:00.081
It's not a joke. People marry.
It's not revolutionary.

02:05:00.159 --> 02:05:02.253
Some animals mate for life.

02:05:02.412 --> 02:05:03.413
Geese.

02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:06.379
You use the animals for your own argument.

02:05:06.457 --> 02:05:08.084
You won't let me use them for mine.

02:05:09.335 --> 02:05:10.678
I'd mate for life.

02:05:13.339 --> 02:05:15.012
One day at a time.

02:05:17.176 --> 02:05:21.397
I'd just like someone to
ask me once, that's all.

02:05:21.639 --> 02:05:25.018
Promise me you'll do that
if I promise to say no?

02:05:25.101 --> 02:05:26.648
Just trust you?

02:05:32.984 --> 02:05:34.611
When you go away.

02:05:35.862 --> 02:05:38.490
You don't always go on safari, do you?

02:05:43.077 --> 02:05:44.078
No.

02:05:44.787 --> 02:05:46.789
You just want to be away.

02:05:48.791 --> 02:05:50.885
It's not meant to hurt you.

02:05:52.545 --> 02:05:53.797
It does.

02:05:55.757 --> 02:05:58.601
I'm with you because I choose to be with you.

02:05:58.676 --> 02:06:02.101
I don't want to live someone
else's idea of how to live.

02:06:02.180 --> 02:06:04.148
Don't ask me to do that.

02:06:04.223 --> 02:06:05.566
I don't want to find out one day

02:06:05.641 --> 02:06:07.860
that I'm at the end of someone else's life.

02:06:10.438 --> 02:06:13.032
I'm willing to pay for mine.
To be lonely sometimes,

02:06:13.107 --> 02:06:15.701
to die alone if I have to.
I think that's fair.

02:06:15.777 --> 02:06:18.326
Not quite.
You want me to pay for it as well.

02:06:18.404 --> 02:06:22.329
You have a choice, and you're not
willing to do the same for me.

02:06:25.703 --> 02:06:27.831
I won't be closer to you,

02:06:28.539 --> 02:06:32.009
and I won't love you more
because of a piece of paper.

02:06:45.348 --> 02:06:47.442
See if you can shore it up.

02:07:02.323 --> 02:07:03.666
Let it go.

02:07:06.452 --> 02:07:08.955
This water lives in Mombasa anyway.

02:07:55.126 --> 02:07:56.753
<i>I flew as far as Narok.</i>

02:07:57.253 --> 02:08:00.507
You could see all the ruts
where the lorries had been.

02:08:00.590 --> 02:08:02.467
The Serengeti was still good.

02:08:02.550 --> 02:08:04.644
It would take a week just getting there.

02:08:10.349 --> 02:08:12.351
And Samburu's still good.

02:08:12.602 --> 02:08:15.196
Where's Belknap?
I haven't seen him.

02:08:18.774 --> 02:08:20.947
He must be in America by now.

02:08:23.988 --> 02:08:25.490
I let him go.

02:08:27.116 --> 02:08:28.584
I had to.

02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:32.414
But you don't want to hear
about the farm, do you?

02:08:32.830 --> 02:08:33.956
Have you got any buttons?

02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:35.508
What are you doing?

02:08:35.958 --> 02:08:37.005
Mending your shirts.

02:08:37.084 --> 02:08:39.303
Don't do that.

02:08:40.087 --> 02:08:41.509
You don't have to do that.

02:08:50.765 --> 02:08:53.018
Maybe I'll try Samburu day after tomorrow.

02:08:53.142 --> 02:08:54.815
You just got back.

02:08:59.315 --> 02:09:01.738
Felicity asked to come along,

02:09:03.611 --> 02:09:06.740
and I almost said no because I
thought you wouldn't like it.

02:09:06.822 --> 02:09:08.415
There's no reason for her not to come.

02:09:08.491 --> 02:09:10.038
Yes, there is.
I wouldn't like it.

02:09:10.952 --> 02:09:12.420
You want her along?

02:09:12.495 --> 02:09:14.088
I want things that don't matter not to.

02:09:14.163 --> 02:09:15.756
Tell her no, do it for me.

02:09:15.831 --> 02:09:17.253
Then what else would it be?

02:09:17.333 --> 02:09:19.427
Why is your freedom more important than mine?

02:09:19.502 --> 02:09:22.426
It isn't. And I've never
interfered with your freedom.

02:09:22.505 --> 02:09:25.133
I'm not allowed to need you or rely on you

02:09:25.216 --> 02:09:28.265
or expect anything from you!
I'm free to leave!

02:09:29.553 --> 02:09:31.647
But I do need you.
You don't need me.

02:09:31.722 --> 02:09:34.100
If I die will you die?
You don't need me.

02:09:34.183 --> 02:09:36.902
You confuse need with want.
You always have.

02:09:36.978 --> 02:09:40.107
In your world, there would be no love at all.

02:09:40.189 --> 02:09:42.612
Or the best kind. The one
we wouldn't have to prove!

02:09:42.692 --> 02:09:44.035
You'd live on the moon then.

02:09:44.110 --> 02:09:45.487
Because I won't do it your way?

02:09:45.569 --> 02:09:48.413
Are we assuming there is
one proper way to do this?

02:09:48.489 --> 02:09:50.207
Do you think I care about Felicity'?

02:09:50.283 --> 02:09:52.456
Do you think I'll be involved with her?

02:09:56.706 --> 02:09:57.798
No.

02:09:57.873 --> 02:09:59.184
Then there's no reason for this, is there?

02:09:59.208 --> 02:10:01.381
If she's not important why won't you give it up?

02:10:04.213 --> 02:10:06.887
I have learned a thing that you haven't.

02:10:08.092 --> 02:10:10.720
There are some things worth having,

02:10:11.721 --> 02:10:15.191
but they come at a price,
and I want to be one of them.

02:10:17.768 --> 02:10:19.395
I won't allow it.

02:10:22.231 --> 02:10:25.405
You have no idea the effect
that language has on me.

02:10:25.484 --> 02:10:28.158
I used to think there was
nothing you really wanted,

02:10:28.237 --> 02:10:30.239
but that's not it, is it?

02:10:30.531 --> 02:10:32.499
You want to have it all.

02:10:38.414 --> 02:10:41.384
I'm going to Samburu and she can come or not.

02:10:48.007 --> 02:10:50.351
Then you'll be living elsewhere.

02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:58.693
All right.

02:11:38.641 --> 02:11:40.689
Is there a prince in there?

02:11:58.327 --> 02:12:00.830
I think that you had better get up.

02:12:01.997 --> 02:12:06.002
You had better get up.
I think that God is coming.

02:13:02.057 --> 02:13:03.354
All gone.

02:13:21.327 --> 02:13:23.000
How did it start?

02:13:23.078 --> 02:13:24.751
I think God had a hand in it.

02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:28.175
He gave me my best crop ever
and then he remembered.

02:13:28.584 --> 02:13:31.053
Insurance?
That's for pessimists.

02:13:32.087 --> 02:13:33.680
Where's Denys?

02:13:34.173 --> 02:13:35.516
Who knows?

02:13:38.093 --> 02:13:40.892
It doesn't matter.
The Baroness is broke.

02:13:42.598 --> 02:13:44.271
It's over.

02:13:44.350 --> 02:13:48.196
I've got to find some land
before I go for my Kikuyu.

02:13:48.437 --> 02:13:49.780
You have trouble enough.

02:13:49.855 --> 02:13:53.029
Just a chunk somewhere so
they can stay all together.

02:13:55.903 --> 02:13:59.908
We're just out of coffee,
but I can give you tea.

02:14:01.659 --> 02:14:05.038
There is no arable land that
size outside the reserve.

02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:07.589
And if there were, we'd not put natives on it.

02:14:07.748 --> 02:14:09.045
Since it's theirs.

02:14:09.124 --> 02:14:13.300
It belongs to the Crown. What
you want is quite impossible.

02:14:13.462 --> 02:14:17.137
It always is.
Who must I see next?

02:14:17.216 --> 02:14:19.844
You've run through us all, I'm afraid.

02:14:20.261 --> 02:14:22.514
We have a new governor, haven't we?

02:14:22.596 --> 02:14:25.349
Sir Joseph.
He hasn't arrived yet.

02:14:25.808 --> 02:14:27.731
But will soon, I'm told.

02:14:28.727 --> 02:14:30.604
You do still ask me to things.

02:14:31.397 --> 02:14:33.491
Captain Jacques Llewllyn.

02:14:33.566 --> 02:14:35.068
Your servant, sir.

02:14:36.902 --> 02:14:40.156
The Honorable Hugh Chomondeley, Lord Delamere.

02:14:40.239 --> 02:14:41.582
Your servant, sir.

02:14:41.657 --> 02:14:42.909
Lady Delamere.

02:14:47.329 --> 02:14:48.376
Commissioner.

02:14:48.455 --> 02:14:49.581
Baroness.

02:14:49.665 --> 02:14:51.008
The Baroness Von Blixen.

02:14:53.127 --> 02:14:55.971
I'm sorry to know that Kenya will be losing you.

02:14:56.171 --> 02:14:58.014
You have heard of my trouble then?

02:14:58.090 --> 02:14:59.888
Yes, I regret it.

02:15:00.676 --> 02:15:02.895
Do you know of my problem now?

02:15:04.263 --> 02:15:06.186
This land you want from us...

02:15:06.890 --> 02:15:08.858
Will you help me?

02:15:09.184 --> 02:15:11.107
That's quite difficult.

02:15:15.649 --> 02:15:18.027
Get up, Baroness, please.

02:15:19.778 --> 02:15:22.201
Kenya is a hard country for women.

02:15:23.616 --> 02:15:26.290
So there is a chivalry here of a sort.

02:15:26.368 --> 02:15:29.463
You are a powerful man and
I've no one else to turn to.

02:15:29.538 --> 02:15:31.415
Let's discuss this in the proper way.

02:15:31.498 --> 02:15:34.297
You mustn't be embarrassed.
I've lost everything.

02:15:34.376 --> 02:15:35.969
It costs me very little to beg you.

02:15:36.045 --> 02:15:37.171
Wait.

02:15:39.048 --> 02:15:41.050
Give her a moment, please?

02:15:51.352 --> 02:15:53.104
This land was theirs.

02:15:53.771 --> 02:15:56.775
We took it and now they've nowhere else to go.

02:15:56.899 --> 02:15:59.903
I'll look into it.
We'll do the best we can.

02:16:01.403 --> 02:16:03.201
May I have your word?

02:16:08.911 --> 02:16:10.413
You have mine.

02:16:20.631 --> 02:16:21.928
Thank you.

02:16:23.425 --> 02:16:27.601
I hope you will be happy here.
I was.

02:16:29.598 --> 02:16:31.145
I'm sorry I won't know you.

02:16:45.781 --> 02:16:48.204
I didn't hear it until I got to the border.

02:16:48.282 --> 02:16:51.787
It seems I'll do almost
anything to get your attention.

02:16:57.668 --> 02:16:59.796
I've nearly got you packed.

02:17:06.635 --> 02:17:07.682
My poor family.

02:17:07.761 --> 02:17:11.436
I've got them near bankrupt, now I
have to ask them for more money.

02:17:12.933 --> 02:17:14.559
Let me help you.

02:17:16.352 --> 02:17:18.230
You would keep me then?

02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:25.737
I want to be worth something now.

02:17:28.031 --> 02:17:29.657
What will you do?

02:17:30.284 --> 02:17:32.332
After my rummage sale, leave.

02:17:33.370 --> 02:17:37.546
Friday for Mombasa,
and then the boat to Denmark.

02:17:56.393 --> 02:17:57.815
Thank you, Denys.

02:18:08.237 --> 02:18:11.412
You must have them ready
to leave before the rains.

02:18:11.700 --> 02:18:13.623
It is good land, enough for all,

02:18:13.701 --> 02:18:15.375
but they must not fight about it

02:18:15.454 --> 02:18:18.674
or be any trouble to the
authorities, do you understand?

02:18:18.749 --> 02:18:19.921
Or they will lose it.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:21.092
Yes.

02:18:21.168 --> 02:18:24.718
You must make them understand
that I will not be here

02:18:25.547 --> 02:18:27.344
to speak for them.

02:18:27.591 --> 02:18:28.888
This land is far?

02:18:28.967 --> 02:18:31.389
By Dagoretti.
Not too far.

02:18:35.724 --> 02:18:39.318
How can it be now?
With me and yourself?

02:18:40.228 --> 02:18:43.028
You will have some money.
Enough, I think.

02:18:43.898 --> 02:18:45.901
I do not speak of money.

02:18:50.239 --> 02:18:53.959
Do you remember how it was on safari?

02:18:55.035 --> 02:18:58.755
In the afternoons I would send
you ahead to look for a camp?

02:18:59.164 --> 02:19:01.007
And you would wait for me.

02:19:01.083 --> 02:19:05.179
And you can see the fire and come to this place.

02:19:07.923 --> 02:19:08.924
Yes.

02:19:11.218 --> 02:19:13.016
It will be like that.

02:19:15.888 --> 02:19:19.393
Only this time I will go ahead and wait for you.

02:19:21.770 --> 02:19:24.614
It is far where you are going?

02:19:27.860 --> 02:19:28.906
Yes.

02:19:30.946 --> 02:19:33.449
You must make this fire very big,

02:19:34.449 --> 02:19:36.246
so I can find you.

02:19:44.041 --> 02:19:46.090
Take that out to the lawn.

02:20:26.752 --> 02:20:28.504
Have you had dinner?

02:20:30.881 --> 02:20:31.973
Yes.

02:20:40.515 --> 02:20:42.142
I've packed your things.

02:20:42.225 --> 02:20:44.728
I thought I would send them on to the club.

02:20:44.811 --> 02:20:46.484
Is that all right?

02:21:08.502 --> 02:21:10.721
This wasn't a very good idea.

02:21:23.892 --> 02:21:27.237
I think we should have had
it this way all the time.

02:21:29.064 --> 02:21:32.238
I don't know. I was beginning
to like your things.

02:21:34.403 --> 02:21:37.407
And I was beginning to like living without them.

02:21:47.416 --> 02:21:49.885
You've ruined it for me, you know?

02:21:51.128 --> 02:21:52.596
Ruined what?

02:21:56.967 --> 02:21:58.264
Being alone.

02:22:01.513 --> 02:22:02.685
Havel?

02:22:09.604 --> 02:22:12.073
I'd like to come with you to Mombasa.

02:22:15.652 --> 02:22:17.450
Can I fly you there?

02:22:18.947 --> 02:22:21.041
Aren't you going away again?

02:22:21.825 --> 02:22:23.577
I have some things to do tomorrow at Tsavo,

02:22:23.660 --> 02:22:25.537
but I'll be back on Friday.

02:22:27.789 --> 02:22:28.836
Will that be all right?

02:22:32.044 --> 02:22:33.136
Of course.

02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:42.180
I've got this little thing that
I've learned to do lately.

02:22:43.472 --> 02:22:47.397
When it gets so bad and I think

02:22:48.226 --> 02:22:49.773
I can't go on,

02:22:50.312 --> 02:22:52.531
I try to make it worse.

02:22:54.816 --> 02:22:57.865
I make myself think about our camp on the river.

02:23:01.865 --> 02:23:03.367
And Berkeley.

02:23:05.577 --> 02:23:08.501
And the first time that you took me flying.

02:23:10.707 --> 02:23:12.505
How good it all was.

02:23:17.172 --> 02:23:20.176
And when I'm certain that I can't stand it,

02:23:20.550 --> 02:23:22.928
I go one moment more,

02:23:25.764 --> 02:23:28.438
and then I know I can bear anything.

02:23:32.896 --> 02:23:34.944
Would you like to help me?

02:23:36.274 --> 02:23:37.366
Yes.

02:23:47.953 --> 02:23:49.955
Come dance with me then.

02:24:38.003 --> 02:24:42.554
You were right, you Know.
The farm never did belong to me.

02:24:45.385 --> 02:24:47.228
I may have been wrong.

02:24:48.805 --> 02:24:51.149
<i>I had a farm in Africa.</i>

02:24:54.603 --> 02:24:55.650
<i>Friday?</i>

02:24:55.729 --> 02:24:56.946
<i>Yes.</i>

02:26:32.284 --> 02:26:33.331
Hello, Bror.

02:26:42.794 --> 02:26:44.671
Would you like a drink?

02:26:47.799 --> 02:26:49.016
Please.

02:27:08.737 --> 02:27:10.660
Denys has been killed.

02:27:13.074 --> 02:27:15.168
His plane crashed at Tsavo.

02:27:36.931 --> 02:27:38.604
There was a fire.

02:27:52.072 --> 02:27:54.074
Can I take you into town?

02:27:57.452 --> 02:27:59.329
Why did they send you?

02:28:03.124 --> 02:28:04.592
I thought I should.

02:28:12.759 --> 02:28:14.511
My God, you're brave.

02:28:53.842 --> 02:28:57.472
"The sun shall not smite
thee by day, nor the moon at night.

02:28:57.554 --> 02:29:00.524
"The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil.

02:29:00.598 --> 02:29:02.692
"He shall preserve thy soul.

02:29:03.059 --> 02:29:06.484
"The Lord shall preserve thy
going out and thy coming in.

02:29:06.563 --> 02:29:09.316
"From this time forth and even forevermore."

02:29:09.399 --> 02:29:10.400
Amen.

02:29:38.052 --> 02:29:40.646
"The time you won your town the race

02:29:41.973 --> 02:29:44.817
"We chaired you through the market-place

02:29:45.226 --> 02:29:48.070
"Man and boy stood cheering by

02:29:48.146 --> 02:29:51.320
"And home we brought you shoulder-high

02:29:53.318 --> 02:29:56.913
"Smart lad, to slip betimes away

02:29:57.947 --> 02:30:00.826
"From fields where glory does not stay

02:30:02.660 --> 02:30:05.083
"And early though the laurel grows

02:30:05.914 --> 02:30:08.417
"it withers quicker than a rose.

02:30:09.918 --> 02:30:12.296
"Now you will not swell the rout

02:30:12.378 --> 02:30:14.722
"Of lads that wore their honors out

02:30:15.965 --> 02:30:18.263
"Runners whom renown outran

02:30:19.427 --> 02:30:22.806
"And the name died before the man

02:30:25.350 --> 02:30:27.978
"And round that early-laurelled head

02:30:29.145 --> 02:30:32.115
"Will flock to gaze the strengthless dead

02:30:33.942 --> 02:30:36.991
"And find unwithered on its curls

02:30:39.489 --> 02:30:41.491
"A garland

02:30:47.789 --> 02:30:49.917
"briefer than a girl's"

02:31:07.517 --> 02:31:10.862
Now take back the soul
of Denys George Finch Hatton,

02:31:13.314 --> 02:31:15.533
whom You have shared with us.

02:31:18.152 --> 02:31:19.950
He brought us joy

02:31:21.864 --> 02:31:23.866
and we loved him well.

02:31:27.287 --> 02:31:28.960
He was not ours.

02:31:33.126 --> 02:31:34.719
He was not mine.

02:32:45.573 --> 02:32:47.792
<i>If I know a song of Africa,</i>

02:32:49.702 --> 02:32:51.454
<i>of the giraffe</i>

02:32:51.788 --> 02:32:55.338
<i>and the African new moon lying on her back,</i>

02:32:56.918 --> 02:32:59.262
<i>of the ploughs in the fields</i>

02:32:59.754 --> 02:33:02.758
<i>and the sweaty faces of the coffee pickers,</i>

02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:07.394
<i>does Africa know a song of me?</i>

02:33:10.056 --> 02:33:12.684
<i>Will the air over the plain quiver</i>

02:33:12.767 --> 02:33:15.486
<i>with a color that I have had on?</i>

02:33:17.355 --> 02:33:22.282
<i>Or will the children invent
a game in which my name is?</i>

02:33:24.445 --> 02:33:29.246
<i>Or the full moon throw a shadow
over the gravel of the drive</i>

02:33:30.284 --> 02:33:32.036
<i>that was like me?</i>

02:33:33.705 --> 02:33:38.085
<i>Or will the eagles of the
Ngong Hills look out for me?</i>

02:33:50.972 --> 02:33:53.316
You cannot come where I'm going.

02:33:53.391 --> 02:33:56.110
There is no cooking where you are going?

02:33:57.311 --> 02:33:59.313
You would not like it there.

02:34:00.231 --> 02:34:02.325
You must trust me about this.

02:34:24.797 --> 02:34:27.926
Letters you can send on
to this address in Denmark.

02:34:28.301 --> 02:34:29.598
When you sell the car,

02:34:29.677 --> 02:34:32.100
if you would send the check to Hunter & Company,

02:34:32.180 --> 02:34:34.854
and anything else you don't
know what to do with.

02:34:34.974 --> 02:34:36.351
Yes, ma'am.

02:34:39.604 --> 02:34:42.778
I've been sent to ask if
we may stand you a drink.

02:34:43.524 --> 02:34:44.867
Who is "we"?

02:34:46.194 --> 02:34:47.992
The members actually.

02:34:51.866 --> 02:34:53.288
All right.

02:35:09.342 --> 02:35:10.969
Whiskey, please.

02:35:12.303 --> 02:35:14.055
Two whiskeys, please.

02:35:40.081 --> 02:35:43.426
Rose-lipt maidens, lightfoot lads.

02:35:44.085 --> 02:35:45.928
Hear, hear!

02:35:54.470 --> 02:35:55.813
Thank you.

02:36:04.605 --> 02:36:06.607
This is very dear to me.

02:36:09.151 --> 02:36:11.449
It has helped me to find my way.

02:36:13.072 --> 02:36:14.665
<i>Thank you, msabu.</i>

02:36:31.465 --> 02:36:33.763
I want to hear you say my name.

02:36:36.971 --> 02:36:38.848
You are Karen.

02:36:53.321 --> 02:36:55.323
<i>The mail has come today,</i>

<i>"The Masai have reported to the

<i>"A lion and a lioness have come there</i>

<i>"I suppose that the level place</i>

<i>"makes a good site for the lions.</i>

<i>"From there they have a view over the plain,</i>

02:37:43.412 --> 02:37:46.586

02:37:49.377 --> 02:37:51.379
<i>Denys will like that.</i>

<i>I must remember to tell him.</i>
