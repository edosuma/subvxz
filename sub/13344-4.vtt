WEBVTT

00:05.706 --> 00:07.475
( thunder rumbles )

00:07.575 --> 00:10.378
Man:
HEY, LENNY, IT'S YOUR DAD.
PICK UP.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.713
HEY, WHAT'S GOING
ON THERE, LITTLE MAN?

00:14.115 --> 00:15.349
IN A COUPLE HOURS.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.385
LISTEN, HAS MOMMY
LEFT ALREADY?

00:18.819 --> 00:20.754
SHE WASN'T HOME?

00:20.854 --> 00:22.690
NO, SHE'S NOT
PICKING UP HER CELL.

00:24.392 --> 00:25.859
WHAT?

00:25.959 --> 00:27.628
WHAT ARE YOU EATING?

00:28.962 --> 00:30.431
THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE AN APPLE.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.766
IT SOUNDS LIKE A FRITO.
ARE YOU EATING FRITOS?

00:34.335 --> 00:36.204
OKAY, LENNY, I DON'T HAVE
THE TIME FOR THIS RIGHT NOW.

00:36.304 --> 00:38.472
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
WHEN I GET BACK, OKAY? BYE.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.274
- ( phone beeps )
- THE WAY SHE STUFFS HIM

00:40.374 --> 00:41.809
WITH JUNK FOOD
DRIVES ME CRAZY.

00:41.909 --> 00:44.612
( chuckles )

00:44.712 --> 00:46.013
( phone beeps )

00:46.114 --> 00:47.748
Hi, this is Amy.
Leave me a message.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.983
IT'S ME, I'M AT PAUL'S.
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

00:50.084 --> 00:52.986
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:53.087 --> 00:54.755
( phone beeps )

01:19.513 --> 01:22.816
Paul:
WHY DON'T YOU
SIT DOWN, JAKE?

01:22.916 --> 01:24.618
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE
HERE IN A MOMENT.

01:24.718 --> 01:27.621
- ( dialing )
- THIS TIME SLOT SUCKS.

01:27.721 --> 01:30.458
Hi, this is Amy.
Leave me a message.

01:30.558 --> 01:33.194
DON'T FUCKING TELL ME
YOU FORGOT WE'RE DUE AT PAUL'S.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.296
- CALL ME BACK. BYE.
- ( phone beeps )

01:35.396 --> 01:36.564
SHE KNOWS WE HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.132
WE TALKED ABOUT IT
THIS MORNING.

01:38.232 --> 01:40.100
( dialing )

01:44.905 --> 01:46.507
SARAH, WHAT'S UP?
HI, IT'S JAKE.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.176
JAKE.

01:48.276 --> 01:49.743
DID SHE LEAVE
ALREADY?

01:49.843 --> 01:51.512
WHEN?

01:52.346 --> 01:55.316
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:55.416 --> 01:57.651
20 MINUTES
OR THREE HOURS?

01:59.453 --> 02:01.255
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE SHE WAS GOING?

02:03.957 --> 02:05.526
DID SHE LEAVE ALONE?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.628
ALONE-- THAT MEANS
WITHOUT ANYONE ELSE.

02:07.728 --> 02:10.231
OH, OKAY.

02:10.331 --> 02:12.366
GOOD, GOOD GIRL.
SEE, THAT WAS EASY, RIGHT?

02:12.466 --> 02:14.468
FINE FINE.
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.
BYE.

02:14.568 --> 02:17.738
- ( phone beeps )
- FUCK HER!

02:19.373 --> 02:22.443
WAS THAT SOMEBODY
FROM AMY'S OFFICE?

02:23.711 --> 02:25.679
YEAH, THEY'RE ALL
SO FULL OF THEMSELVES.

02:25.779 --> 02:26.947
I CAN'T STAND THEM.

02:27.047 --> 02:29.082
I'M SORRY, WHAT EXACTLY
DOES AMY DO?

02:29.183 --> 02:32.052
SHE'S DEPUTY VP

02:32.152 --> 02:33.621
SOMETHING, WHATEVER.

02:33.721 --> 02:36.724
SHE'S ALL ABOUT WORK NOW.
LENNY BARELY SEES HER.

02:41.229 --> 02:44.832
ARE YOU COMFORTABLE
BEING HERE

02:44.932 --> 02:46.634
WITH ME WITHOUT AMY?

02:48.436 --> 02:51.505
YEAH, I'M COMFORTABLE.

02:51.605 --> 02:54.107
BUT YOU SAID WE SHOULDN'T START
UNTIL WE'RE BOTH HERE, RIGHT?

02:54.208 --> 02:55.943
SO WE WAIT.

02:56.043 --> 02:57.978
WE CAN START AT
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

02:58.078 --> 03:00.180
IT'S JUST--
IF YOU DON'T MIND

03:00.281 --> 03:02.350
THAT AMY HAS TO HEAR
IT ALL AGAIN.

03:02.450 --> 03:05.653
NO, IT'S OKAY.
WE'LL WAIT.

03:09.923 --> 03:12.125
I'M JUST GETTING
THE SENSE,

03:12.226 --> 03:15.763
JAKE, THAT THIS IS
DIFFICULT FOR YOU

03:15.863 --> 03:17.265
TO BE HERE
WITHOUT HER.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.099
- ( laughs )
- ( dialing )

03:19.199 --> 03:21.569
NO, IT'S NOT DIFFICULT.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.238
HI, MOLLY.

03:24.338 --> 03:26.173
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

03:26.274 --> 03:28.008
CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?

03:28.108 --> 03:29.477
GREAT.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.279
LISTEN, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE AMY IS?

03:31.379 --> 03:33.481
IF I KNEW,
I WOULDN'T BE CALLING.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.816
SHE'S NOT PICKING UP.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.488
DO YOU OR DON'T YOU
KNOW WHERE SHE IS?

03:42.690 --> 03:45.259
MOLLY, I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING, OKAY?

03:45.359 --> 03:47.728
ALL RIGHT, I'LL LET HER KNOW.
OKAY, BYE.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.797
- ( phone beeps )
- HER MOTHER. JESUS.

03:51.299 --> 03:53.066
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:53.166 --> 03:54.368
THE WAY THEY TALK?

03:54.468 --> 03:55.869
YOU CAN TELL
THEY'RE LOADED.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.472
THEY GOT MONEY COMING
OUT OF THEIR ASSES.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.342
- AMY TOO?
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

04:01.442 --> 04:04.578
- ( phone ringing )
- SHE'S LUCKY I KEEP THINGS
IN PERSPECTIVE FOR HER.

04:04.678 --> 04:07.881
- ( ringing continues )
- HER MOTHER.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.752
YES, MOLLY,
WHAT IS IT?

04:12.686 --> 04:14.087
AN ATTACK?

04:14.187 --> 04:15.789
AN ATTACK OF WHAT?

04:15.889 --> 04:19.627
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS RUSH
TO THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO?

04:19.727 --> 04:22.863
WELL, FINE, GO ON WORRYING.
I'M NOT.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.832
BECAUSE.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.167
I'M NOT WORRIED, MOLLY.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

04:27.267 --> 04:28.802
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.

04:28.902 --> 04:31.204
OKAY, MOLLY, I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING, OKAY?

04:31.305 --> 04:32.940
BYE. BYE.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.477
NOW I'M IN TROUBLE WITH
HER MOTHER THE HYSTERIC.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.712
SHE SOUNDS ANXIOUS.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.681
SHE'S A WRECK.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.817
MAYBE SHE'S SKIPPING
THROUGH THE STAGES OF...

04:43.917 --> 04:45.753
ANXIETY.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.823
WHAT?

04:49.923 --> 04:52.460
WELL, IT'S LIKE,

04:52.560 --> 04:54.495
LET'S SAY YOU ARRANGED
TO MEET SOMEBODY,

04:54.595 --> 04:56.564
A PARTICULAR TIME
AT A PARTICULAR PLACE.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.432
AND YOU ARRIVE
AND THEY'RE NOT THERE.

04:58.532 --> 04:59.733
AND YOU THINK
TO YOURSELF, "OH,

04:59.833 --> 05:01.835
MAYBE I GOT THE TIME
OR THE PLACE WRONG.

05:01.935 --> 05:05.439
AND THEN YOU GET TO THE STAGE
WHERE YOU GET ANGRY

05:05.539 --> 05:06.907
AND YOU SAY,
"WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY?

05:07.007 --> 05:08.542
THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE."

05:08.642 --> 05:12.079
AND THEN YOU GET
TO THE STAGE OF ANXIETY

05:12.179 --> 05:14.081
WHERE YOU'RE WORRIED
IF SOMETHING HAS

05:14.181 --> 05:17.785
HAPPENED TO THEM.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.423
OKAY, I'M OUTTA HERE.
I DON'T THINK--

05:22.523 --> 05:24.525
I THINK YOU SHOULD STAY
A FEW MORE MINUTES.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.462
SHE WAS LATE
LAST WEEK, REMEMBER?

05:29.697 --> 05:31.499
MAYBE I LEFT
MY RINGER OFF.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.834
NO, YOU IDIOT,
HER MOTHER JUST CALLED YOU.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.738
OKAY.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.039
ARE YOU LEAVING?

05:39.139 --> 05:42.443
I'M GONNA STEP OUTSIDE.
MAYBE I CAN SEE SOMETHING.

05:42.543 --> 05:45.312
JAKE, WHY ARE YOU
SO WORRIED?

05:45.413 --> 05:48.081
YOU MEAN WHAT ACT
OF ANXIETY AM I IN?

05:49.316 --> 05:50.651
THAT'S INTERESTING.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.554
THAT YOU SAY
ACT OF ANXIETY.

05:53.654 --> 05:57.525
BECAUSE IT'S AN ACT,
NOT A STAGE.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.793
IT'S FROM THAT
PRETENTIOUS FAG.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.262
SO YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH
THE WORKS OF ROLAND BARTHES?

06:02.362 --> 06:04.865
SURPRISE SURPRISE.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.137
( phone ringing )

06:10.237 --> 06:11.772
HER MOTHER?

06:11.872 --> 06:14.074
HER MOTHER.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.785
I'M LATE, SORRY.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.556
HI.
WHO'S CALLING?

06:28.656 --> 06:30.123
WHY DON'T YOU
ANSWER THE PHONE?

06:30.223 --> 06:31.559
WHERE WERE YOU?

06:31.659 --> 06:33.661
I'M RIGHT HERE.
WHAT, WERE YOU WORRIED?

06:33.761 --> 06:35.963
- YOU WEREN'T PICKING UP.
- REALLY?

06:39.032 --> 06:41.935
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.
I SWITCHED IT OFF
DURING THE MEETING.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.271
I FORGOT TO TURN IT
BACK ON AGAIN.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.239
WHERE WERE YOU?

06:46.339 --> 06:48.341
AT WORK, WHERE ELSE?

06:48.442 --> 06:51.078
WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN
THE MEANTIME, MUD WRESTLING?

06:52.846 --> 06:55.048
WRESTLING.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.450
THAT'S WHAT
IT LOOKS LIKE.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.352
IT'S JUST A REALLY
BAD TIME SLOT.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.354
WHAT?

07:01.455 --> 07:03.491
SARAH SAID YOU LEFT
A LONG TIME AGO.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.025
SO? TRAFFIC.

07:05.125 --> 07:08.395
YOU WERE WEARING A DIFFERENT
OUTFIT THIS MORNING.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.330
HE NOTICED.
I JUST BOUGHT IT.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.199
YOU JUST WENT AND BOUGHT
YOURSELF A SUIT?

07:12.299 --> 07:15.002
YEAH, I SPILLED COFFEE OVER
MYSELF DURING THE MEETING.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.971
- WHAT MEETING?
- ARE YOU GONNA SIT OR WHAT?

07:25.312 --> 07:27.247
THERE WAS TRAFFIC.
THAT'S IT.

07:27.347 --> 07:28.882
- 2:00.
- WHAT?

07:28.982 --> 07:30.551
SARAH SAID YOU LEFT
THE OFFICE AT 2:00.

07:30.651 --> 07:34.221
THAT'S RIGHT.
I TOLD YOU I HAD
A MEETING.

07:34.321 --> 07:35.756
A MEETING WITH WHOM?

07:35.856 --> 07:37.324
WHAT IS WITH
THE INTERROGATION?

07:37.424 --> 07:40.227
WITH REEVES.
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

07:40.327 --> 07:42.796
WHO'S REEVES, AMY?

07:42.896 --> 07:45.465
MY BOSS.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.268
SO WHERE WAS IT,
THIS MEETING?

07:48.368 --> 07:50.403
AT A CAFE.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.172
WHY ARE YOU WASTING
OUR TIME HERE

07:52.272 --> 07:53.774
WITH PAUL
ON THIS BULLSHIT?

07:53.874 --> 07:56.109
WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE
THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE
YOU CAME IN LATE.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.547
IS IT USUAL

07:59.647 --> 08:01.081
FOR YOU TO BE LATE, AMY.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.583
SOMETIMES

08:02.683 --> 08:04.618
I'M FASHIONABLY LATE.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.820
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN LATE FOR

08:06.920 --> 08:09.156
ALL OF OUR
THREE SESSIONS SO FAR.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.593
I APOLOGIZE.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.895
IS YOUR BEING LATE
AN INDICATOR

08:14.995 --> 08:16.730
OF NOT WANTING
TO BE HERE, PERHAPS?

08:16.830 --> 08:20.367
DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

08:20.467 --> 08:24.572
SO, YOU'RE
USUALLY LATE, AMY,

08:24.672 --> 08:28.508
AND THIS IS USUALLY
YOUR REACTION, JAKE.

08:28.609 --> 08:31.011
IS THIS HIS
USUAL RESPONSE?

08:31.111 --> 08:32.512
YES.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.582
HE'S SUSPICIOUS.

08:34.682 --> 08:38.018
DO YOU THINK PERHAPS AMY
HAS SOMETHING TO HIDE, JAKE?

08:40.688 --> 08:43.090
IS THAT WHY YOU WERE
NERVOUS EARLIER ON?

08:43.190 --> 08:44.391
I WASN'T NERVOUS.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.660
MAYBE IT WAS YOU

08:46.760 --> 08:48.528
WHO WAS NERVOUS
TO BE ALONE WITH ME.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.263
HE'S A BUNDLE OF NERVES.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.000
- WELL, PERHAPS IF--
- WHERE'D YOU GET THE OUTFIT?

08:53.100 --> 08:55.535
- PAUL'S TALKING.
- WHERE'D YOU GET THE OUTFIT?

08:55.636 --> 08:57.337
I TOLD YOU, I SPILLED
COFFEE ON MYSELF

08:57.437 --> 08:59.139
SO I WENT AND BOUGHT IT.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.874
WHICH CAFE
DID YOU GO TO?

09:00.974 --> 09:04.945
DO YOU SEE WHAT
I HAVE TO DEAL WITH HERE?

09:07.715 --> 09:10.684
THE BAKERY
NEXT TO THE OFFICE.

09:10.784 --> 09:14.387
I HAD AN ESPRESSO.
HE HAD A MINT TEA.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.556
I HAD AN ALMOND CROISSANT.
HE HAD TOAST.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.125
THERE'S NO SHOPPING
IN THAT AREA.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.727
- SO?
- SO WHAT,
YOU DROVE TO A MALL?

09:19.827 --> 09:22.429
- WHERE TO?
- SO WHAT IF I DID?

09:22.529 --> 09:24.798
ALL THE WAY
TO A MALL.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.566
YEAH.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.874
HOW MUCH DO
WE OWE YOU, PAUL?

09:33.974 --> 09:36.509
- WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?
- HOW MUCH DO WE OWE YOU?

09:36.610 --> 09:37.911
WHY?

09:38.011 --> 09:40.013
BECAUSE WE'RE WASTING
OUR TIME, THAT'S WHY.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.115
- SHE WENT
TO FINALIZE THE ABORTION.
- I DIDN'T FINALIZE ANYTHING.

09:42.215 --> 09:45.152
WHILE WE'VE BEEN SITTING
HERE WAITING TO TALK
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

09:45.252 --> 09:48.455
WE SHOULD HAVE AN ABORTION,
SHE'S MEETING WITH KORNREICH
TO WORK OUT DETAILS.

09:48.555 --> 09:49.790
I DIDN'T WORK OUT
ANY DETAILS.

09:49.890 --> 09:52.693
- YOU'RE LYING.
- I BOUGHT A SUIT.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.895
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT
SEE KORNREICH?

10:04.571 --> 10:05.906
I DID SEE HIM.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.642
BUT I DIDN'T
WORK OUT ANYTHING.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.310
Jake:
SO WHAT WERE
YOU DOING THERE?

10:11.812 --> 10:13.881
HE TOLD BOTH OF US THAT
HE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING

10:13.981 --> 10:16.750
TILL HE RAN SOME TESTS.
SO HE TOOK SOME BLOOD
FROM ME.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.518
AND YOU CALL ME SUSPICIOUS.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.287
DO YOU SEE WHY
I HIDE THINGS FROM YOU?

10:20.387 --> 10:22.155
BECAUSE YOU REACT
LIKE A MADMAN.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.758
IT ISN'T AN ABORTION.
IT'S IN CASE WE DECIDE
TO HAVE AN ABORTION.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.694
DID KORNREICH ASK WHAT
I THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THIS

10:26.794 --> 10:28.528
OR IS YOUR OPINION
AND HIS ENOUGH?

10:28.628 --> 10:30.230
OH, GOD, HERE WE GO.
THE MAN'S BEEN GIVING ME

10:30.330 --> 10:32.565
FERTILITY TREATMENTS
FOR FIVE YEARS.
CAN I TALK TO HIM?

10:32.666 --> 10:35.535
IF YOU WERE WEARING THIS
OUTFIT I'M SURE HE WAS
HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.538
DID HE LOOK UNDER IT?

10:38.638 --> 10:42.375
DID HE CHECK YOU
BEFORE TAKING YOUR BLOOD?

10:44.477 --> 10:45.713
YOU'RE SUCH A SHITHEAD.

10:45.813 --> 10:47.414
WHEN SHE CURSES, PAUL,

10:47.514 --> 10:49.416
YOU KNOW SHE'S LYING.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.357
I THINK, JAKE,
WHAT AMY

10:57.457 --> 11:00.127
MIGHT BE TRYING
TO SAY IS THAT

11:00.227 --> 11:02.830
SHE CAN'T TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THIS ABORTION

11:02.930 --> 11:06.800
BECAUSE YOU SUSPECT
ANYTHING THAT SHE SAYS.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.271
I'M THE ONE
AT FAULT HERE?

11:11.371 --> 11:13.707
I'M THE ONE AT FAULT?

11:13.807 --> 11:15.776
SHE ARRANGES A MEETING
WITH HER OB BEHIND MY BACK

11:15.876 --> 11:17.845
AND I'M THE ONE
AT FAULT HERE?

11:17.945 --> 11:20.714
TELL ME SOMETHING,
IS SHE PAYING YOU
BEHIND MY BACK TOO?

11:20.814 --> 11:22.682
OH, RIGHT.
I BRIBED HIM

11:22.783 --> 11:24.384
SO I CAN
HAVE AN ABORTION.

11:24.484 --> 11:27.520
AND ON THE OTHER HAND,

11:27.620 --> 11:29.656
AMY, YOU MAY
BE RESPONSIBLE

11:29.757 --> 11:31.358
FOR JAKE'S SUSPICIONS
BECAUSE YOU BEHAVE

11:31.458 --> 11:33.293
LIKE SOMEBODY WHO'S
GOT SOMETHING TO HIDE.

11:33.393 --> 11:34.828
BECAUSE YOU LIE.

11:34.928 --> 11:37.530
BECAUSE YOU WON'T ALLOW ME
TO HAVE ANY DOUBT.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.099
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN BY THAT?

11:39.199 --> 11:40.768
Amy:
WELL, YOU CAN SEE IT
FOR YOURSELF.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.804
HE WON'T EVEN CONSIDER
AN ABORTION AS AN OPTION.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.406
AND LOOK AT HIM.
DO YOU HEAR HOW
HE TALKS TO ME?

11:46.506 --> 11:48.541
WELL, PERHAPS HIS, UH--

11:48.641 --> 11:50.844
HIS AGGRESSIVE
ATTITUDE REFLECTS

11:50.944 --> 11:52.813
HIS NEED TO BE

11:52.913 --> 11:55.415
MORE AWARE OF WHAT'S
HAPPENING TO YOU,

11:55.515 --> 11:56.884
TO BE PART
OF YOUR DECISION,

11:56.984 --> 12:00.287
TO UNDERSTAND
YOUR THOUGHT PROCESSES.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.222
MAYBE IT'S A, UH--

12:02.322 --> 12:05.926
IT'S AN EXPRESSION
OF HIS LOVE FOR YOU.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.431
LOVE?

12:11.531 --> 12:13.967
GOD.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.602
CURSING ME OUT'S
ALL ABOUT LOVE?

12:15.702 --> 12:17.304
I DIDN'T CURSE.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.872
AND YOU'RE A LIAR.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.441
I'LL GO AND SEE
DR. KORNREICH TOMORROW

12:21.541 --> 12:24.377
AND I'LL DISCUSS IT WITH HIM
AND I WILL MAKE A DECISION.

12:24.477 --> 12:27.981
AMY, CAN YOU
TELL US WHAT--

12:28.081 --> 12:30.550
WHAT THE MOST
IMPORTANT ISSUES

12:30.650 --> 12:32.052
FOR YOU ARE?

12:32.152 --> 12:34.054
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
THAT HERE, PAUL.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.456
I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT
TO BE PREGNANT AGAIN.

12:36.556 --> 12:37.825
SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO HAVE THE BABY.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.927
I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT
ANOTHER BABY, OKAY?

12:40.027 --> 12:43.396
I'M NOT SURE.
I TOLD YOU, I'M TIRED.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.899
ARE YOU CAPABLE OF THINKING
OF ANYTHING BUT YOURSELF?

12:45.999 --> 12:48.601
- IT'S MY PREGNANCY.
- OUR PREGNANCY. IT'S OURS.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.303
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.105
AND THE HEMORRHOIDS,
ARE THOSE YOURS TOO?

12:52.205 --> 12:54.141
AND THE NINE MONTHS OF MORNING
SICKNESS, WHOSE ARE THOSE?

12:54.241 --> 12:56.743
AND THE EXTRA 50 LBS,
ARE THOSE YOURS TOO?

12:56.844 --> 12:59.579
HAVE YOU SPOKEN
TO DR. KORNREICH ABOUT

12:59.679 --> 13:03.250
TERMINATING THIS PREGNANCY
THAT YOU'VE WANTED FOR SO LONG?

13:06.053 --> 13:07.921
YES.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.026
I DON'T THINK, UM,

13:13.126 --> 13:15.929
I'LL BE ABLE
TO LOVE ANOTHER BABY.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.366
I'M ANGRY AT HIM ALREADY.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.202
I FEEL LIKE IT'S FORCING ITSEF
INTO THE MIDDLE OF THINGS.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.338
EVER SINCE I BECAME PREGNANT,
I'VE FELT THE HORMONES RAGING,

13:25.438 --> 13:27.007
DRIVING ME INSANE.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.641
AND I KNOW
I'LL HAVE POSTPARTUM

13:28.741 --> 13:30.978
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME.
I SEE IT COMING

13:31.078 --> 13:34.882
AND IT PARALYZES ME.

13:40.387 --> 13:43.423
I WON'T BE ABLE
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS CHILD.

13:48.528 --> 13:52.332
I WON'T LOVE HIM.

13:55.368 --> 13:58.271
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M CAPABLE OF, YOU KNOW?

13:58.371 --> 14:00.440
I SCARE MYSELF.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.442
I SCARE MYSELF TO DEATH.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.581
( sniffles )

14:16.356 --> 14:18.959
SO, WAS THAT
CONVINCING ENOUGH?

14:25.732 --> 14:27.234
YOU'RE INSANE.

14:27.334 --> 14:30.170
WHY, BECAUSE I WANT TO BE ABLE
TO MAKE MY OWN DECISION?

14:30.270 --> 14:31.905
- DERANGED.
- REALLY?

14:32.005 --> 14:33.473
- YEAH.
- WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE,

14:33.573 --> 14:35.475
AND ASSUMING YOU'RE
MENTALLY HEALTHY,

14:35.575 --> 14:36.776
WHY ARE YOU IN SUCH A HURRY

14:36.876 --> 14:39.112
TO HAVE ANOTHER
CHILD WITH ME?

14:45.852 --> 14:47.620
MAYBE YOU COULD
EXPLAIN IT TO HER, PAUL.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.390
MAYBE YOU COULD EXPLAIN
THAT IT'S ABNORMAL FOR A WOMAN

14:50.490 --> 14:53.460
TO MAKE UP SUCH A CRAZY SPEECH
ABOUT BEING DEPRESSED.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.129
I WANT TO GET YOU
AND KORNREICH AND EVERYBODY
OFF MY BACK

14:56.229 --> 14:57.730
SO I CAN MAKE
MY OWN DECISION.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.166
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF PLAYING THE PART

14:59.266 --> 15:01.969
OF THE DEPRESSED WIFE
WILL DO IT, GREAT. THERE.

15:09.776 --> 15:12.645
I'M SORRY
I MADE ALL THAT UP.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.982
REALLY?

15:16.483 --> 15:18.051
WHAT?

15:18.151 --> 15:19.852
DID YOU MAKE IT UP?

15:19.953 --> 15:22.622
I TOLD YOU,
SHE'S A BORN LIAR.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.624
I LIED
AND I APOLOGIZE.

15:24.724 --> 15:25.959
WHAT? I'LL GO
KNEEL IN THE CORNER

15:26.059 --> 15:27.460
AND PRAY
FOR FORGIVENESS.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.230
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE
THAT SOMETHING IN THIS...

15:31.264 --> 15:33.700
FAKE NARRATIVE OF YOURS

15:33.800 --> 15:37.337
HAS MORE THAN
A GRAIN OF TRUTH?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.672
THOSE FEARS SOUNDED
VERY REAL TO ME.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.009
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE'S A THERAPIST.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.777
MAYBE I'M HEARING WHAT SHE'S
TRYING TO TELL YOU, JAKE.

15:44.877 --> 15:47.180
WHAT AM I TRYING
TO SAY TO HIM?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.516
THAT YOU'RE TERRIFIED.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.485
YOU'RE TERRIFIED
OF HAVING THIS CHILD.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.789
CAN'T YOU HEAR THAT?

15:56.889 --> 16:01.028
SHE'S EXAGGERATING HER FEARS
SO THAT YOU WILL HEAR HER,

16:01.128 --> 16:03.663
SO THAT YOU WILL
LISTEN TO HER.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.501
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:08.601 --> 16:11.738
HE MEANS THAT IT'S
ABNORMAL FOR A WOMAN

16:11.838 --> 16:14.574
WHO'S SPENT FIVE YEARS
IN FERTILIZATION TREATMENTS

16:14.674 --> 16:17.477
TO WANT TO GET RID OF
THE BABY BECAUSE SHE'S
AFRAID OF HEMORRHOIDS.

16:24.717 --> 16:28.388
IT, UM--
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

16:28.488 --> 16:32.359
BOTH OF YOU HAVE A WIDE
RANGE OF EMOTIONS

16:32.459 --> 16:36.329
IN RESPECT
TO THIS PREGNANCY.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.497
PERHAPS, JAKE,

16:37.597 --> 16:41.201
YOU'RE NOT CONFRONTING
YOUR FEARS

16:41.301 --> 16:45.038
ABOUT NOT WANTING
ANOTHER BABY.

16:45.138 --> 16:47.774
AND YOU, AMY,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

16:47.874 --> 16:49.409
IF YOU WEREN'T SO BUSY
FENDING HIM OFF,

16:49.509 --> 16:51.878
YOU MIGHT FIND
WITHIN YOURSELF

16:51.978 --> 16:55.382
ARGUMENTS FOR WANTING
ANOTHER CHILD.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.785
WHY IS IT SO HARD
FOR THE TWO OF YOU

16:58.885 --> 17:01.288
TO UNDERSTAND THAT
A WOMAN MAY CHOOSE

17:01.388 --> 17:02.989
TO PUT HER CAREER
OR HER BODY

17:03.090 --> 17:05.925
OR WHATEVER AHEAD
OF HAVING A CHILD?

17:06.025 --> 17:08.695
Paul:
I THINK WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY

17:08.795 --> 17:10.863
IS THAT I DON'T THINK

17:10.963 --> 17:12.499
THE ISSUE IS AS CLEAR-CUT

17:12.599 --> 17:15.235
- AS BOTH OF YOU
WANT TO ADMIT.
- Jake: BULLSHIT!

17:15.335 --> 17:17.637
TOTAL BULLSHIT.
YOU'RE TALKING TO TWO PEOPLE

17:17.737 --> 17:20.840
WHO SPENT FIVE YEARS
IN FERTILITY TREATMENTS.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.775
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE?

17:22.875 --> 17:24.477
FIVE YEARS?

17:24.577 --> 17:26.846
FOR FIVE YEARS
THEY'VE INJECTED ME

17:26.946 --> 17:28.915
AND HURT ME
AND DRAWN THINGS OUT OF ME

17:29.015 --> 17:30.550
AND TOLD ME WHEN TO EAT
AND WHEN TO SLEEP

17:30.650 --> 17:32.585
AND WHEN TO BREATHE
AND WHEN TO FUCK.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.354
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY HANDS
WENT IN AND OUT OF MY BODY

17:34.454 --> 17:36.956
DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS?

17:37.056 --> 17:39.426
FOR NOTHING.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.494
AND WHEN WE STOPPED
THE TREATMENTS,

17:41.594 --> 17:44.131
AND NOT BECAUSE I WANTED TO,
BECAUSE THE DOCTOR TOLD US TO,

17:44.231 --> 17:45.965
THE WHOLE WORLD,
INCLUDING HIM,

17:46.065 --> 17:49.035
COMFORTED ME AND SAID,
"OH, YOU KNOW, MAYBE
IT'S FOR THE BEST."

17:49.136 --> 17:50.437
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:50.537 --> 17:53.473
THEY ACTUALLY MANAGED
TO CONVINCE ME.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.075
SO HERE I AM
AND IT'S A YEAR LATER

17:56.176 --> 17:58.077
AND I FEEL HAPPIER
AND I'VE LOST THE WEIGHT.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.847
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME
I CAN ACTUALLY SEE MYSELF

18:00.947 --> 18:02.449
AS SOMEONE WHO--
SOMEONE WHO--

18:02.549 --> 18:05.318
SOMEONE WHO'D NEVER HAVE
A BABY WITH A SHITHEAD.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.989
YOU ARE SO PRIMITIVE.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.791
PRIMITIVE?

18:11.891 --> 18:13.393
MMM.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.029
BACK WHEN SHE WAS
CHEATING WITH ME

18:17.130 --> 18:18.598
ON HER FIRST
HUSBAND, PAUL,

18:18.698 --> 18:20.733
I WAS SEXY.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.736
BUT NOW I'M PRIMITIVE.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.405
I STILL FIND YOU SEXY.

18:25.505 --> 18:28.841
NOT AS SEXY
AS REEVES, RIGHT?

18:28.941 --> 18:30.310
YOU'RE WRONG,
BELIEVE ME.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.512
YOU KNOW,
FOR A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR,

18:32.612 --> 18:35.382
YOU SURE SAY
"BELIEVE ME" A LOT.

18:35.482 --> 18:38.050
I'M A LIAR
AND DERANGED
AND EGOTISTICAL.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.719
ANYTHING ELSE?

18:39.819 --> 18:42.189
JUST ADMIT THAT YOU DON'T
WANT TO HAVE MY CHILD.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.524
WE ALREADY HAVE
A CHILD, REMEMBER?

18:44.624 --> 18:46.326
YES, I DO.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.695
HE'S AT HOME HAVING
DING DONGS FOR DINNER.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.506
( sighs )

18:59.606 --> 19:01.641
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

19:01.741 --> 19:03.976
YOU'RE NOT REALLY TALKING
ABOUT A CHILD.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.745
YOU'RE REALLY
TALKING ABOUT

19:05.845 --> 19:07.314
YOUR INABILITY
TO ACCEPT

19:07.414 --> 19:09.616
EACH OTHER
FOR WHO YOU ARE.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.551
YOU KNOW, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.221
EXCUSE ME, BUT I JUST
DON'T GET IT.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.055
WE CAME HERE
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO

19:16.155 --> 19:17.624
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T
MAKE A DECISION.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.692
AND AS TIME GOES BY,
YOU TRY TO CONVINCE US

19:19.792 --> 19:22.795
THAT WE'RE NOT INDECISIVE
BUT THAT WE HAVE PROBLEMS.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.131
YOU HAVEN'T HELPED US
TO DECIDE WHETHER TO HAVE
THE BABY OR NOT

19:25.232 --> 19:27.334
BUT YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB
OF GETTING US TO FIGHT.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.701
WELL, I THINK
WHAT'S COMING OUT HERE--

19:28.801 --> 19:30.737
WE DIDN'T COME HERE
IN ORDER TO BRING THINGS OUT.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.105
WE CAME HERE TO DECIDE
WHETHER TO KEEP THE BABY
OR NOT KEEP IT, THAT'S ALL.

19:33.206 --> 19:36.075
BUT IT'S NOT
A YES OR NO ANSWER.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.977
TELL ME, HOW DO YOU
SLEEP AT NIGHT?

19:38.077 --> 19:40.112
WHAT, DO YOU THINK I SHOULD
HAVE PROBLEMS SLEEPING AT NIGHT?

19:40.213 --> 19:42.649
IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
A SEPARATION HERE THEN YOU
SHOULD LOSE SOME SLEEP.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.651
BUT I WASN'T TALKING
ABOUT A SEPARATION.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.586
WHY ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT A SEPARATION?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.488
WE CAME HERE TO TALK
ABOUT A PREGNANCY

19:48.588 --> 19:50.223
AND WE END UP TALKING
ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER THINGS.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.191
RELATIONSHIP YES,
RELATIONSHIP NO--

19:52.292 --> 19:54.594
I'M SICK OF IT.
YES TO THE PREGNANCY OR NO.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.095
TO HAVE AN ABORTION
OR NOT HAVE IT.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.764
JUST FUCKING
SAY IT ALREADY.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.166
TO KEEP THE CHILD
OR DON'T KEEP IT.
TELL US WHAT YOU THINK.

20:00.267 --> 20:02.001
YOU WANT ME TO GIVE YOU
AN ANSWER RIGHT NOW?

20:02.101 --> 20:03.570
YES! I WANT
A YES OR A NO.

20:03.670 --> 20:06.273
I THINK YOU SHOULD
HAVE AN ABORTION.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.811
REALLY?

20:11.911 --> 20:15.448
GO AHEAD,
HAVE AN ABORTION.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.618
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

20:24.557 --> 20:26.593
DO YOU SEE
WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE?

20:26.693 --> 20:30.563
DO YOU SEE HOW YOU SHOVED ME
INTO A CORNER?

20:30.663 --> 20:32.432
DO YOU SEE HOW I HAD
TO GIVE YOU THE ANSWER

20:32.532 --> 20:33.733
THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO HEAR?

20:33.833 --> 20:36.869
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU DO WITH AMY.

20:38.405 --> 20:41.708
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHETHER
OR NOT TO HAVE AN ABORTION.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.445
YES, YOU CAN.
YOU JUST DID.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.046
I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER.

20:47.146 --> 20:49.248
YOU JUST GAVE US AN ANSWER.
YOU SAID TO GET AN ABORTION.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.784
YOU COULD'VE SAID
MANY THINGS BUT YOU TOLD US
TO HAVE AN ABORTION, RIGHT?

20:51.884 --> 20:54.220
YOU DID.
YOU HAD AN OPINION
AND YOU LET IT SLIP OUT.

20:54.321 --> 20:55.488
YOU'RE MURDERING
OUR CHILD.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.457
- STOP. LEAVE HIM ALONE.
- OKAY, LET'S GO.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.359
YOU GOT WHAT
YOU CAME HERE FOR, RIGHT?

20:59.459 --> 21:01.361
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO DO HERE.
LET'S STOP WASTING OUR TIME.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.996
YOU KNOW WHY I CAN'T
TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT
YOU SHOULD HAVE AN ABORTION?

21:04.096 --> 21:06.699
IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH WHETHER I'M
A PSYCHOTHERAPIST OR NOT,

21:06.799 --> 21:09.702
WHETHER I'M ALLOWED
OR WHETHER I'M NOT ALLOWED.

21:09.802 --> 21:12.372
THIS IS A PERSONAL
DECISION FOR YOU BOTH.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.707
IT IS A PERSONAL
AND MORAL DECISION

21:14.807 --> 21:17.710
THAT YOU MUST TAKE
YOURSELVES.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.447
ALL I CAN DO IS HELP YOU
TO CONFRONT YOUR FEELINGS

21:20.547 --> 21:23.082
SO THAT YOU COME
TO A CORRECT DECISION

21:23.182 --> 21:25.785
FOR YOU BOTH.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.787
THAT'S ALL I CAN DO.

21:27.887 --> 21:30.823
THAT'S IT.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.501
( door opens )

22:32.419 --> 22:34.053
AHEM.

22:36.789 --> 22:38.458
GOODBYE, AMY.

23:15.361 --> 23:16.963
( dial tone )

23:17.063 --> 23:20.733
( dialing )

23:20.833 --> 23:22.168
( ringing )

23:22.268 --> 23:25.237
Hello, you've reached
the office of Dr. Gina Toll.

23:25.337 --> 23:26.773
Please leave me a message

23:26.873 --> 23:28.875

as soon as I can.

23:28.975 --> 23:30.176
( beeps )

23:30.276 --> 23:31.844
GINA, IT'S PAUL.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.312
PAUL WESTON.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.915
I KNOW IT'S BEEN
QUITE A WHILE.

23:37.349 --> 23:39.986
I'LL--

23:40.086 --> 23:41.788
I'LL TRY AGAIN LATER.
