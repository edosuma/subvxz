12:45.625 --> 12:49.750
I want the whole world to know about us.
[chuckles]

12:49.834 --> 12:53.667
This is the Joe you're going to be
romantically linked to.

12:53.917 --> 12:57.709
I haven't seen him this happy
since he became a fifth-level wizard.

13:01.375 --> 13:03.917
And it's all thanks to Fion...

13:06.291 --> 13:08.291
-Yes!
-We did it!

13:08.375 --> 13:10.166
-That's right.
-She's gone.

13:10.625 --> 13:13.250
Joe-Joe-bear, got your burger.

13:14.333 --> 13:15.667
Dad, she's gone.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.709
Oh, I just...

13:18.250 --> 13:19.625
[sniffs]
Mmm.

13:19.709 --> 13:22.625
That's, uh...
Nope, nope, no.

13:26.875 --> 13:29.000
You had to see the look
on Fiona's face when she saw me.

13:29.083 --> 13:31.875
And when I told her I was going to go out
as the real Joe in public,

13:31.959 --> 13:33.875
the girl ran for the hills.

13:33.959 --> 13:35.667
We're pretty sure she lives there.

13:35.750 --> 13:37.458
-Yay.
-I can promise you that's the last time

13:37.542 --> 13:38.959
we're gonna be seeing Fiona Skye.

13:40.291 --> 13:43.375
-Hi, Pookins!
-[all] Oh, no.

13:43.458 --> 13:45.500
Paolo posted the pictures
he took at your house

13:45.583 --> 13:47.333
and the fan sites are on fire!

13:47.417 --> 13:50.792
-What?
-"Fiona brings out the real Joe."

13:54.125 --> 13:56.959
-[pop song ringtone plays]
-[clears throat]

13:59.417 --> 14:00.875
Hello.
Fiona.

14:01.667 --> 14:04.417
No, no, no! I specifically said
that my romance with Joe

14:04.500 --> 14:07.041
should be kept private.
And you can print that.

14:07.125 --> 14:08.333
[clears throat]

14:08.667 --> 14:09.583
[snaps fingers]

14:11.208 --> 14:14.083
-[screams]
-Wow.

14:14.166 --> 14:16.667
You should've been in
<i>Scream Till You Die Screaming.</i>

14:16.750 --> 14:17.875
That would've been good.

14:23.208 --> 14:25.458
It's hopeless.
No matter what I say or do,

14:25.542 --> 14:28.250
all the magazines are talking about
is my romance with Fiona.

14:28.333 --> 14:31.083
Not true. They also mention
that you are a world-class nerd.

14:31.166 --> 14:32.709
Thanks, Nick.
That'll do.

14:32.792 --> 14:35.250
Then we've gotta get them
talking about something else.

14:35.333 --> 14:39.583
-Because the best way to end one rumor...
-Is by starting another.

14:39.667 --> 14:42.375
-Mm-hmm.
-You are a genius.

14:42.458 --> 14:44.750
You don't get to be head
of the #1 Jonas fan club

14:44.834 --> 14:46.667
without knowing how to deal with gossip.

14:47.083 --> 14:49.041
Well, then where
did we go wrong, professor?

14:49.125 --> 14:50.875
To get Fiona Skye to leave you alone,

14:50.959 --> 14:52.417
you tried to make yourself
less attractive.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.625
-So?
-There is absolutely no way

14:54.709 --> 14:57.792
-you can make yourself less attractive.
-Told you.

14:57.875 --> 15:00.667
What you need to do
is make the sites and mags believe

15:00.750 --> 15:03.458
that you've found someone
more attractive than Fiona.

15:04.834 --> 15:07.208
"Joe dumps Fiona for mystery girl."

15:07.291 --> 15:08.750
Yeah, well, you're going to need pictures.

15:08.834 --> 15:10.166
And that means we'll need a mystery girl.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.083
We can put Nick in a wig and a dress.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.792
[chuckles]
No, we can't.

15:14.166 --> 15:15.250
Yeah, you're probably right.

15:15.333 --> 15:16.583
That's more publicity
than we're looking for.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.834
Um, there's gotta be somebody.

15:31.625 --> 15:34.375
Oh, no.
No. No. No.

15:35.750 --> 15:38.625
[camera clicking]

15:42.333 --> 15:44.083
[Macy]
Great. Now take her hand.

15:47.125 --> 15:49.166
What do you want me to do with it?

15:54.458 --> 15:56.000
Hold it.

15:56.083 --> 15:58.291
Now, look at her like you're in love.

16:03.834 --> 16:07.125
Is that your in-love face
or did you just eat a bad taco?

16:10.709 --> 16:12.667
OK, moving on.

16:12.917 --> 16:15.834
Now you're skiing down a big hill.

16:15.917 --> 16:18.667
Smile. The wind is in your face.

16:18.750 --> 16:20.291
All right, now swoosh to a stop.

16:22.709 --> 16:25.875
Ha! OK, now a big hug.

16:32.208 --> 16:36.166
Uh, all right. Well, hug high.
And his arm...

16:36.250 --> 16:39.959
No. Uh, you're getting
a little tangled there.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.208
[sighs]

16:41.291 --> 16:44.542
OK, now, gaze into each other's eyes.

16:45.500 --> 16:49.000
And closer.
And closer.

16:49.959 --> 16:51.542
And closer.

16:52.458 --> 16:55.250
-Now kiss her!
-[both] I'm done.

16:59.875 --> 17:01.542
I'm just saying
I think it was a little rude

17:01.625 --> 17:03.125
to go down the slope in front of me.

17:03.208 --> 17:07.375
-We weren't really skiing!
-They posted the pictures and the story!

17:07.458 --> 17:09.125
My first credit in a major magazine!

17:09.208 --> 17:12.583
-Look.
-"Photos by Missy Mesa." Missy Mesa?

17:12.667 --> 17:15.291
-Close enough.
-OK, let me see. Let me see.

17:15.375 --> 17:20.083
"Joe leaves Fiona for fake blonde."
Fake blonde?!

17:20.166 --> 17:23.083
I'm in the big time now.
I had to spice it up.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.583
Besides, no one will know
you're the mystery woman.

17:25.667 --> 17:28.250
-Ah, the mystery woman.
-Bye.

17:28.583 --> 17:29.834
[gasps]

17:29.917 --> 17:32.375
I knew it was you the minute
I saw the fake blonde hair.

17:32.458 --> 17:34.250
-OK, you know what? That's it.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:34.333 --> 17:36.917
You think the press is just gonna
drop me and focus on you?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.333
They always side
with the wounded girlfriend.

17:39.417 --> 17:41.542
-You're not my girlfriend!
-Of course, I am.

17:41.625 --> 17:46.375
That's why you bought me this...
diamond bracelet for my birthday.

17:46.750 --> 17:49.333
Wow.
I'm a big spender.

17:49.709 --> 17:52.166
And all I got for my birthday
was a macramé guitar strap

17:52.250 --> 17:55.000
that said "Rock on!"
Thanks a lot.

17:55.083 --> 17:57.166
OK, you know what?
You cannot keep this up.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.542
Sooner or later, people are
gonna realize that this is all fake,

17:59.625 --> 18:01.625
and what are you gonna say
when the press asks you

18:01.709 --> 18:04.208
what it is about Joe
that you love so much?

18:04.291 --> 18:08.333
Easy.
His fame, his success, his fans.

18:08.417 --> 18:11.083
All superficial.
They're gonna see right through it.

18:11.542 --> 18:12.583
Really?

18:12.667 --> 18:16.166
And what will his "mystery woman"
say she loves about him?

18:16.250 --> 18:19.291
[scoffs] OK, I'm not going to pretend
to be in love with Joe.

18:19.375 --> 18:22.417
But if I was, I would say...

18:23.000 --> 18:25.291
the way he flips his hair
out of his eyes,

18:25.375 --> 18:29.333
and the way he grins
when he gets nervous, and...

18:30.417 --> 18:31.834
his heart.

18:36.583 --> 18:39.041
Well, it looks to me
like we have a love triangle

18:39.125 --> 18:41.125
the press is going to
suck up with a straw.

18:41.208 --> 18:43.375
[groans]
I can't live like this!

18:43.458 --> 18:46.083
Ooh, that's good.
"Joe can't live without Fiona."

18:46.166 --> 18:48.834
Will you please just go away?
I am begging you.

18:48.917 --> 18:51.417
Oh, don't beg, honey.
It's not pretty.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.375
Guess what else isn't pretty?

18:54.959 --> 18:56.500
Who are you?

18:57.291 --> 19:00.792
I'm Missy Mesa:
blogger, Jonas Fan Club president

19:00.875 --> 19:06.500
and, as of today, the owner
of a very rare Fiona Skye photo.

19:06.583 --> 19:10.792
Or should I say...
Bertha Snerkus?

19:14.709 --> 19:18.959
My ninth grade yearbook photo?
Where did you get that?!

19:19.041 --> 19:21.333
From my newest fan club member.

19:22.834 --> 19:24.583
Oh, and here's your hat.

19:24.667 --> 19:26.125
[chuckles]

19:27.458 --> 19:31.458
I think the only headline that will
prevent this photo from being released

19:31.542 --> 19:35.375
is, "Fiona Skye breaks up with Joe!"

19:36.000 --> 19:40.208
Paolo, after all you've done for me,
this is how you repay me?

19:40.667 --> 19:42.208
Don't speak to me.

19:45.917 --> 19:47.000
Way to go, Macy.

19:47.083 --> 19:48.875
Oh! I'd better hurry

19:48.959 --> 19:50.750
if I'm want to be the first
to post about your break-up.

19:53.542 --> 19:57.750
Stella, so, do you really like all those
things you said you like about me?

19:58.375 --> 20:01.583
Oh, um, I don't really
remember what I said.

20:02.417 --> 20:03.750
Oh, yeah,
I think it had something to do

20:03.834 --> 20:08.041
with the way he flips his hair,
you know, out of his eyes, like...

20:09.834 --> 20:13.291
It looks better with...
not my hair.

20:13.792 --> 20:16.083
Did I say that?
That's funny, I don't remember.

20:16.166 --> 20:17.208
It was like two minutes ago.

20:17.291 --> 20:19.125
Yeah, I think you also mentioned
that you like the way he grins

20:19.208 --> 20:21.000
when he's nervous.
Kinda like this.

20:23.834 --> 20:26.375
All right, it doesn't
look good on my face. I get it.

20:26.458 --> 20:29.625
You also said
you think that I'm super-hot, so...

20:29.709 --> 20:32.041
-OK, I did not say that.
-Yeah, she didn't. She didn't say that.

20:32.125 --> 20:33.750
-Yeah, you did.
-I so did not.

20:33.834 --> 20:35.583
Joe, now it's your turn.

20:35.667 --> 20:36.917
-What?
-[Nick] Yeah, Joe,

20:37.000 --> 20:38.834
tell us three things
you love about Stella.

20:41.417 --> 20:42.542
Well?

20:52.375 --> 20:54.083
I gotta go.

20:57.208 --> 20:58.333
Oh, yeah?

20:58.417 --> 21:01.417
Well, your smile's nothing special,
you know.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.500
Oh, who am I kidding?
He's adorable.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.917
-[dance music playing]
-[crowd cheering]

21:30.750 --> 21:33.375
OK, I'll admit
it would have been kinda cool

21:33.458 --> 21:35.500
to be known as the "mystery girl"
in Joe's life.

21:38.709 --> 21:40.417
[woman]
Hey, it's the fake blonde!

21:41.000 --> 21:43.208
Hey, the fake blonde has a name!

21:43.291 --> 21:44.959
It's Stella Malone!

21:45.041 --> 21:46.709
You can thank me later.
