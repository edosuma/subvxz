WEBVTT

00:54.137 --> 00:55.556
What's going on, Sprout?

00:56.139 --> 00:58.475
Okay. Close your eyes.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.893
I've got a present for you.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.105
And open them!

01:06.525 --> 01:07.609
A stick?

01:07.693 --> 01:09.361
Not just any stick.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.906
It's the twig of enduring friendship.

01:16.201 --> 01:19.413
My grandfather gave it to mewhen I was very small.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.707
-I want you to have it.-What?

01:23.041 --> 01:26.003
No, Sprout. Your grandfather's stick?

01:26.086 --> 01:30.007
Are you sure you want togive it away to him?

01:30.966 --> 01:33.427
You've only just met him.

01:33.510 --> 01:37.681
Grandfather always said that friendshipis something you give to others.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.975
Not something you keep for yourself.

01:40.559 --> 01:43.478
Well, thanks, Sprout.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.981
You promise you'll look after it, right?

01:46.064 --> 01:47.482
Of course I will.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.818
Really, really look after it?

01:49.902 --> 01:52.279
I really, really promise.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.326
Now we'll be friends forever.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.498
Well, we better get to Time Lab.

02:03.582 --> 02:06.335
Professor Chronopher hates itwhen we're late.

02:06.418 --> 02:07.419
Time Lab?

02:09.713 --> 02:11.632
Come on, we'll be late.

02:15.719 --> 02:16.720
Hooligans!

02:16.803 --> 02:18.180
Sorry!

02:33.237 --> 02:34.321
Wolfboy.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.782
Late, late, late.

02:37.616 --> 02:41.745
Such little respect for time.Horatio Chronopher waits for no one!

02:44.373 --> 02:47.209
Welcome to the Time Tunnel.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.337
Above you lies the future.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.383
Below you, the past.

02:55.092 --> 03:01.056
Time sprytes are students of time,an infinitely complicated business.

03:01.974 --> 03:05.102
The sprytes below uspass stories up to us,

03:06.186 --> 03:09.606
and we pass our storieson to the sprytes above us.

03:10.440 --> 03:14.236
This is how we understandthe history of the world.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.740
So, how do you go up and down?

03:18.824 --> 03:21.910
Is there a time traveling elevator?

03:21.994 --> 03:26.415
-Or a magical slide? Or---Don't be ridiculous.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.584
We take the stairs.

03:32.337 --> 03:37.009
But only trained time sprytescan traverse the passage of time.

03:37.509 --> 03:40.179
The stairs are strictly forbidden.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.097
Why?

03:42.181 --> 03:46.476
If you meddle in the past,it's easy to upset things.

03:46.560 --> 03:50.355
Even the slightest changecan steer the very course of history

03:50.439 --> 03:52.816
in ways you did not intend.

03:52.900 --> 03:57.279
Time sprytes study the passage of timebut never change it.

03:57.988 --> 04:00.282
No, we must never change it.

04:08.207 --> 04:12.127
Today we'll be continuingour exploration of history.

04:26.808 --> 04:29.603
Now, where did we get to?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.104
Yes.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.274
Before the humans arrived,

04:34.358 --> 04:39.029
the balance between creationand destruction was relatively stable.

04:42.157 --> 04:47.037
Sprytes would create things,and the disarrays would destroy them.

04:47.538 --> 04:51.667
There existed an uneasy harmonyin the world.

04:51.750 --> 04:56.672
The balance was altered foreverwhen humans arrived.

04:56.755 --> 04:59.299
Unlike sprytes or disarrays,

04:59.383 --> 05:03.554
humans can be both creativeand destructive.

05:05.264 --> 05:06.765
A precarious power.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.393
And sadly for the world,

05:09.476 --> 05:13.856
humans too often tend towards destruction.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.748
Humans always turn up and ruin everything.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.500
Don't they, sir?

05:34.376 --> 05:37.963
Well, that depends on the human.

05:38.046 --> 05:41.258
Yeah, maybe you just needto give humans a chance.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.468
A chance to destroy everything?

05:43.552 --> 05:47.431
Not all of them are like that.Some humans like to create things.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.309
Yeah.Create things to destroy more things.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.686
That's not true!

05:59.860 --> 06:02.279
Sprout, I'm so sorry.

06:03.572 --> 06:06.533
It's okay. It's okay.

06:14.541 --> 06:18.003
Look what you've done.You're just like the rest of them.

06:25.677 --> 06:28.931
Hold on. Xandra, Sprout, wait.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.433
I only just broke the stick.

06:31.517 --> 06:33.602
So if we go down those stairs,

06:33.685 --> 06:38.315
we could go back to before I broke itand bring it back here good as new.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.275
Good as new?

06:40.776 --> 06:43.820
Come on, Xandra. It's worth a shot.

06:49.535 --> 06:50.661
Fine.

07:19.982 --> 07:22.359
He's so cute.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.869
Your turn, Xandra.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.339
Oh, my socks.

07:44.423 --> 07:47.843
Have you ever seen anything more precious?

07:47.926 --> 07:49.553
Okay, I'm done.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.849
No. Come back, little Xandra.

07:59.563 --> 08:00.647
Hey, you sprytelings,

08:00.731 --> 08:02.357
get away from those stairs!

08:18.123 --> 08:21.335
Stop those sprytelings!They're from the future!

08:21.418 --> 08:23.879
Come on! Let's find that stick.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.508
Hooligans!

08:28.008 --> 08:29.092
Sorry!

08:32.971 --> 08:34.181
That's our dorm!

08:34.264 --> 08:35.807
-Let's go!-Wait, wait.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.393
-What if we're in there?-What?

08:38.477 --> 08:44.024
How are we going to explain ourselvesto ourselves if we see ourselves?

08:46.568 --> 08:47.653
What?

08:56.161 --> 08:59.831
I was so adorable back then.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.341
Quick, Sprout, where's the stick?

09:09.424 --> 09:13.470
It'll be in my special hiding placewith all my other treasures.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.181
Here it is.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.852
Put it back. Put it back!

09:27.734 --> 09:29.611
What? What's going on?

09:29.695 --> 09:32.865
If we take this twigof enduring friendship,

09:32.948 --> 09:36.243
the broken twigof enduring friendship disappears.

09:36.326 --> 09:39.788
So what? We'll have the new one.Let's just take that one back.

09:39.872 --> 09:42.749
But what if taking itchanges other things?

09:42.833 --> 09:46.253
Chronopher said that evenchanging tiny things in the past

09:46.336 --> 09:48.881
can have big consequences.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.885
Nobody touch anything!

09:52.968 --> 09:56.889
-Now, nice and slowly.-And without touching anything!

09:56.972 --> 09:58.974
Just come with us.

10:00.559 --> 10:02.561
-You moved the chair!-Where was it?

10:03.103 --> 10:04.438
-Left a bit.-Like that?

10:04.521 --> 10:06.940
-No! The other left!-Oops.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.818
-You moved the books!-You moved the chair!

10:12.863 --> 10:15.699
Wait. Where'd they go?

10:17.951 --> 10:19.411
-Hooligans!-Sorry!

10:23.790 --> 10:24.791
Hey!

10:25.459 --> 10:26.877
-Now where?-Go up.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.296
-Into the future?-Just go, Sprout.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.341
Hey, I'm taller in the future.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.678
-Hooligans!-Sorry!

10:38.805 --> 10:42.643
-Split up. We'll meet back at our dorm.-Split up? Wait.

10:42.726 --> 10:43.727
No, I--

10:45.145 --> 10:49.316
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.944
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

10:53.904 --> 10:57.449
Hey. Wolfboy's got the twigof enduring friendship.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.953
And I've got the other piece.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.706
Hey. Wait a minute.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.211
-Sprout?-Sprout?

11:09.294 --> 11:12.548
We gave 'em the slip.What are you smiling at?

11:13.549 --> 11:14.925
Nothing.

11:15.008 --> 11:19.096
Okay. Let's get back to the dormbefore they figure out where we are.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.353
Where have you three been?

11:28.313 --> 11:30.148
We were looking for a stick.

11:31.316 --> 11:34.862
Hey, didn't Norman's pot used to be blue?

11:34.945 --> 11:36.029
Hello.

11:36.947 --> 11:41.952
I'm so sorry we couldn't fix it, Sprout.I really thought that might work.

11:42.953 --> 11:45.205
I hope we can still be friends.

11:51.336 --> 11:54.256
It's okay. Now we can each have a piece.

11:54.965 --> 11:58.177
Here you go, Xandra.There's a piece for you too.

11:58.260 --> 12:01.889
I know you're not usuallyone for the soppy stuff, but--

12:01.972 --> 12:03.932
Yeah. I mean, no, I'm not.

12:04.016 --> 12:08.270
But I suppose if it meansso much to you, I guess I'll take it.

12:09.354 --> 12:10.480
See?

12:10.564 --> 12:12.566
Even if we can't change the past,

12:12.649 --> 12:15.235
we can tryand make the best of the future.

12:15.319 --> 12:16.570
Right, Wolfy?

12:16.653 --> 12:17.696
Right.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.751
Hey, Xandra.I can hang up yours too, if you'd like.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.003
Thanks.

12:36.507 --> 12:37.549
Hey.

12:38.050 --> 12:43.722
Sorry for what I said about,you know, humans.

12:51.021 --> 12:54.274
It's happening. It's all happening.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.174
Up time, up, up, upIt's morning

13:19.258 --> 13:22.302
Up time, up, up, upIt's morning

13:22.386 --> 13:25.013
Up time, up, up, upIt's morning

13:25.097 --> 13:26.139
Up time

13:27.766 --> 13:30.477
Up time, up, up, upIt's morning

13:30.561 --> 13:33.397
Up time, up, up, upIt's morning

13:33.480 --> 13:35.983
Up time, up, up, upIt's morning

13:36.066 --> 13:37.442
Up time!

13:42.197 --> 13:44.324
It's too early for your nonsense.

13:44.408 --> 13:46.743
It's never too early for nonsenseNever--

13:46.827 --> 13:47.870
Hey!

13:48.871 --> 13:51.957
Wait. Is today today?

13:52.040 --> 13:54.168
-I think so.-Yes!

13:54.251 --> 13:55.627
It is!

13:58.589 --> 14:00.883
Why is she so excited?

14:00.966 --> 14:02.634
Today is Guardian Lab day.

14:02.718 --> 14:07.347
It's only the most difficult,dicey and dangerous lab there is.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.099
That sounds fun.

14:09.183 --> 14:11.393
Fun? Listen, human.

14:11.476 --> 14:14.438
You've managed to bluff your waythrough all the labs so far…

14:14.521 --> 14:18.775
-I thought that was the plan.-But this is different.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.570
You need to take Guardian Labvery seriously.

14:21.653 --> 14:25.115
It's where we train to guard ourselvesagainst the disarrays.

14:25.199 --> 14:28.076
Disarrays?Like those creeps from Flora's wood?

14:28.577 --> 14:29.912
They weren't that bad.

14:29.995 --> 14:32.247
Those were just the tip of the iceberg.

14:32.331 --> 14:34.541
There are many different typesof disarrays.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.919
Each one more deadly than the last.

14:38.587 --> 14:42.883
This sounds just the job for Excaliboom!

14:46.053 --> 14:50.974
It's a magic light lance. You know,for stunning lake monsters and stuff.

14:51.058 --> 14:55.145
That piece of junk may workagainst silly fake monsters,

14:55.229 --> 14:58.524
but we're trainingto fight real disarrays.

14:58.607 --> 15:02.819
Right. It's gonna needa bit of tinkering with then.

15:07.241 --> 15:09.701
Cool. What else? What else?

15:12.162 --> 15:13.455
What's that?

15:13.539 --> 15:17.751
It's a Runic Reflector.A magical shield of sorts.

15:17.835 --> 15:23.340
It protects you from curses, hexes,jinxes, unwarranted small talk.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.760
-All kinds of things.-That is not a magical shield.

15:26.844 --> 15:29.763
It's just some human stuffthat he's taped together.

15:30.264 --> 15:31.598
Now this…

15:34.601 --> 15:36.728
This is a magical shield.

15:36.812 --> 15:40.732
I don't know, Xandra.Wolfboy's one looks pretty shield-y to me.

15:40.816 --> 15:44.778
Let's just rememberthat you don't have any actual powers.

15:44.862 --> 15:48.448
These human toys aren't gonna help youin the Guardian Lab.

15:48.532 --> 15:51.785
Don't worry,she gets all her grumps out by breakfast.

16:02.588 --> 16:04.047
That ridiculous song.

16:04.715 --> 16:08.719
You know, Xandra,humans do come up with some great stuff.

16:09.553 --> 16:10.679
Like what?

16:10.762 --> 16:11.930
Icy-cream.

16:13.765 --> 16:16.393
Come on, Xandra. Cheer up.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.897
That's right. We mustn't dwell. Not today.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.609
Not on Guardian Lab day!

16:24.818 --> 16:26.445
I hope you're ready, human.

16:27.863 --> 16:31.575
It can't be that dangerous.It's just practice, right?

16:32.117 --> 16:38.165
Right. But Professor Athena,she's not exactly by the book.

16:38.248 --> 16:41.418
But hey,no one's been seriously injured yet.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.318
Professor Athena?

17:11.281 --> 17:15.911
-First lesson: Expect the unexpected.-Yes!

17:15.993 --> 17:19.748
Athena's one of the coolestguardian sprytes that ever lived.

17:19.830 --> 17:23.377
She defeated a hundred disarraysall on her own.

17:23.460 --> 17:26.088
A hundred? Try a thousand.

17:26.171 --> 17:27.631
But when Xandra grows up,

17:27.714 --> 17:31.552
she's gonna be the roughest,toughest guardian spryte of them all.

17:31.635 --> 17:33.720
Oh, Sprout, shush.

17:34.972 --> 17:40.853
Eager young faces on the starting lineof life's great adventure.

17:40.936 --> 17:47.067
But which of you has it in themto become a legendary guardian?

17:54.825 --> 17:58.161
Guardian sprytes are the protectorsof the realm.

17:58.245 --> 18:03.333
The first and last defenseagainst the disarray threat.

18:03.917 --> 18:07.713
Who can tell mewhat a guardian spryte looks like?

18:08.213 --> 18:10.174
-Guardian sprytes---Wrong!

18:10.257 --> 18:12.968
Nobody can describewhat a guardian spryte looks like

18:13.051 --> 18:17.264
because a guardian is not aboutwhat you look like on the outside.

18:17.347 --> 18:22.019
It's about what kind of spryte you areon the inside.

18:22.644 --> 18:26.690
And any one of you young onescan become a guardian.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.484
A true guardian must be brave,

18:29.568 --> 18:33.614
adaptable and… prepared.

18:33.697 --> 18:37.284
And to that end, let us begin.

18:37.367 --> 18:38.619
Xandra.

18:39.369 --> 18:40.454
Yes!

18:44.249 --> 18:49.546
Guardian sprytes must be preparedto fight darkness in any form.

18:50.047 --> 18:54.927
And let me tell you,disarrays come in all shapes and sizes.

18:55.010 --> 18:58.138
Inkies, slinkies, screaming neenees.

18:58.222 --> 19:01.808
Foggers, rotters, memory mites.

19:01.892 --> 19:07.231
Itching millies, crawling marys,slurring screebnies!

19:08.815 --> 19:14.488
But of course, when it comes to preparingfor a real disarray encounter,

19:14.571 --> 19:18.325
there's really only one thing you need.

19:18.408 --> 19:19.451
Practice!

19:24.581 --> 19:25.624
Attack!

19:30.796 --> 19:33.632
Yes. Excellent reflexes.

19:34.633 --> 19:36.552
This doesn't seem too scary.

19:40.389 --> 19:41.598
Wise guy, eh?

19:43.475 --> 19:48.313
Too slow! Disarray? More like miss-array.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.232
Wolfy.

19:50.315 --> 19:53.318
Is that laughter I hear?

19:53.402 --> 19:55.737
You think disarrays are funny?

19:55.821 --> 19:57.990
Maybe this one. A little.

19:58.073 --> 20:03.287
Perhaps it's time we move onto a more advanced lesson, eh?

20:06.039 --> 20:09.251
Who here can tell me about scurillions?

20:10.460 --> 20:12.254
They're shape-shifters.

20:12.337 --> 20:15.048
Their shapes can shift,and you may never know

20:15.132 --> 20:17.801
if the spryte sat beside youis a friend or a foe.

20:17.885 --> 20:19.595
Excellent, Xandra.

20:19.678 --> 20:23.599
Yes.Scurillions are tricky little disarrays.

20:23.682 --> 20:27.477
Not too dangerous,so long as you keep your wits about you.

20:27.561 --> 20:32.232
-So was that the advanced lesson?-Oh, no.

20:32.816 --> 20:35.819
That begins now!

20:51.877 --> 20:56.673
Defeat the disarrays, young sprytelings,and they'll return to their cell.

21:13.023 --> 21:14.441
Little help?

21:16.777 --> 21:17.819
Bees!

21:25.619 --> 21:27.955
Excellent, young lady. Excellent.

21:28.038 --> 21:31.583
You may just have it in youto be a great guardian one day.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.168
Thanks.

21:33.252 --> 21:37.214
I love you.I mean, I love this. Battling disarrays.

21:40.342 --> 21:44.137
Isn't this fun, Sprout? Sprout?

21:44.221 --> 21:47.766
Wolfy, that's not me. I'm me.

22:11.790 --> 22:15.377
I told youyour silly toys aren't gonna work.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.921
Perhaps that's enough learningfor one day.

22:19.131 --> 22:21.091
Let me gather these things up.

22:36.356 --> 22:37.858
Why would Athena,

22:37.941 --> 22:41.236
the world's greatest warrior,want us to stand down?

22:41.820 --> 22:43.113
Unless--

22:43.864 --> 22:44.948
Wait.

22:45.032 --> 22:47.743
Scurillions are shape-shifters.

22:52.789 --> 22:55.918
Nice try, disarray. Another one down.

22:56.001 --> 22:57.711
What have you done?

22:57.794 --> 23:01.924
Relax, Sprout. The real Athena is right--

23:07.513 --> 23:10.766
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! I still love you.

23:26.323 --> 23:27.574
Sprout!

23:41.004 --> 23:42.631
They're after me!

23:42.714 --> 23:44.633
Why are they after me?

23:48.512 --> 23:51.265
Wolfy, what about Excaliboom?

23:52.891 --> 23:54.685
That's not gonna work!

23:55.727 --> 24:00.566
Stay back! Or I'll…

24:15.831 --> 24:18.292
Excali…

24:42.274 --> 24:43.650
Impossible.

24:48.447 --> 24:49.531
Boom.
