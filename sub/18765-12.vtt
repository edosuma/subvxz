WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.684
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.760 --> 00:05.001
Nick and I found
something in the Black Forest-

00:05.080 --> 00:07.208
And I wanna know what's
written on that cloth.

00:07.280 --> 00:08.805
So it is a calendar.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.136
For something that
hasn't happened yet?

00:10.160 --> 00:11.764
March 24th.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.683
Daddy is just gonna help
us find Nick and Eve.

00:13.760 --> 00:15.649
- Where are they?
- The other place.

00:15.720 --> 00:16.767
Through the mirror.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.444
It took Hexenbiest
blood to cross over.

00:18.920 --> 00:19.921
A stick?

00:20.360 --> 00:22.328
It's how Nick
was able to follow Eve.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.690
The stick didn't go through.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.683
It can't.
It doesn't belong there.

00:28.760 --> 00:29.807
What is this place?

00:29.960 --> 00:31.121
There's Wesen everywhere.

00:34.280 --> 00:36.726
These are the symbols
that were on the cloth.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.290
And in the sky.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.765
This skull thing is not
after Eve, and it's not after Nick-

00:42.840 --> 00:43.936
There's been a lot of prophecies

00:43.960 --> 00:45.371
about something
called a Shaphat.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.891
It means child bride.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.200
This beast wants our daughter.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.323
You have any ideas?

01:46.680 --> 01:48.762
This is a waste of time.
I know how to get in there.

01:49.320 --> 01:50.936
Well, then, if you
can get in, I can get in.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.166
No, it's Hexenbiest blood,

01:52.240 --> 01:53.656
not Zauberbiest blood.
There's a difference.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.966
Then we find a way to get me in

01:55.040 --> 01:56.936
because I'm not letting this
thing anywhere near my daughter.

01:56.960 --> 01:58.041
Here it is.

01:58.440 --> 02:00.568
My family Bible, Wesen version,

02:00.680 --> 02:04.127
passed down on my
father's side since 1598.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.884
The Abrahamic belief
is that the dead

02:05.960 --> 02:08.531
go to a specific plane
of existence after death

02:08.600 --> 02:10.887
and that hell is ruled
by a fallen angel.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.336
This is not the time
for Bible study.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.203
No, no, no. This is apropos.

02:14.320 --> 02:17.005
If we think of this
other place as that plane,

02:17.080 --> 02:19.321
and the skull guy
is the fallen angel,

02:19.400 --> 02:22.324
a.k.a. the devil,
Satan, Lucifer,

02:22.400 --> 02:23.600
whatever you wanna call him...

02:24.480 --> 02:26.482
I mean, maybe
it's not hell per Se.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.528
- Looks a lot like it.
- It's different.

02:29.040 --> 02:33.090
There's no lava, no fire, no brimstone.
It's a garden.

02:33.160 --> 02:34.800
I mean, I'm not saying
the Garden of Eden,

02:34.840 --> 02:36.376
but I'm not not saying
the Garden of Eden.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.688
The prophecy heralds a
world overrun by beasts,

02:39.760 --> 02:44.163
but the fires of hell rage within
the beast, not on the land.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.288
I thought the devil
carried a pitchfork.

02:46.440 --> 02:47.885
Well, technically,
it's a trident.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.291
I mean, he's not a farmer.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.010
Or if he is,
he's a "scorched soul" kind.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.336
Well, whatever this is, it
certainly doesn't have any prongs.

02:53.360 --> 02:54.850
Looks more like a staff.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.056
Yeah, this is all
really interesting.

02:56.080 --> 02:58.082
I don't think it's helping
us get to where he is.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.045
I think I know how to do that,

03:00.120 --> 03:02.282
but you're not gonna like it.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.244
What did your friend call Diana?

03:11.320 --> 03:12.446
The Shaphat. Right.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.409
<i>And</i> if <i>what she
suggests is true,</i>

03:14.480 --> 03:17.927
my thinking is Diana's got a lot
of clout in this other place.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.604
She can do some
pretty amazing things

03:19.720 --> 03:21.609
like appear in places she isn't

03:21.720 --> 03:24.200
and read markings on a
cloth that we can't see.

03:24.280 --> 03:25.930
She already knew
about the other place,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.048
and she knows something
wicked is this way coming,

03:28.120 --> 03:29.963
so if anyone can
open the door...

03:30.040 --> 03:31.201
No. Absolutely not.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.416
If we just give her the stick...

03:32.440 --> 03:33.496
No, she's not going in there.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.284
I'm not saying
for her to go there.

03:35.400 --> 03:38.085
I'm saying to let her open
the mirror the way Nick did,

03:38.160 --> 03:39.650
and then Renard
and I can go in there

03:39.720 --> 03:41.449
and get Nick and Eve back.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.646
We have to get that staff
away from him. Yeah.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.245
Ready?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.729
He can kill us, but he's not.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.689
He's trying to trap us.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.523
Nothing about the other place,

04:16.600 --> 04:18.125
but the Zoroastrians believed

04:18.200 --> 04:22.091
there will be a 3,000-year
struggle between good and evil,

04:22.160 --> 04:25.004
which ends with a final
assault by Azi Dahāka.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.681
Ragnarök brings a huge flood.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.610
Um...

04:29.680 --> 04:33.207
The sky is on fire, and all
life gets swallowed by wolves.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.601
So I guess if you're a
wolf, that's good news.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.682
There's something
from Slavic paganism

04:37.760 --> 04:40.525
about protecting Ursa
Minor, the Little Bear,

04:40.600 --> 04:42.807
but if left unprotected,

04:42.880 --> 04:44.325
Little Bear supposedly
gets devoured

04:44.400 --> 04:45.845
by the Doomsday Hound, and...

04:45.920 --> 04:48.241
Let me guess. We're all doomed.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.607
Anything to suggest how to
stop what we're dealing with?

04:51.680 --> 04:53.045
Not really.

04:57.560 --> 04:58.721
Look at this.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.289
Looks like a skull guy.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.042
It's in German, I think.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.050
Not modern German.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.606
This looks much older.

05:10.680 --> 05:13.843
My guess is it's Althochdeutsch.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.763
You read Althochdeutsch?

05:15.840 --> 05:17.968
Nope, but the Internet can.

05:21.920 --> 05:25.322
"Finstarnessi ubil fâhan"

05:25.400 --> 05:28.643
means "Evil darkness trapped."

05:29.640 --> 05:31.961
Can't say that makes
me feel any better.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.005
"Grimm ziohan."

05:37.040 --> 05:38.451
Well, we know at least one word.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.128
"Ziohan" means "to pull."

05:43.480 --> 05:44.686
"Grimm pull."

05:45.320 --> 05:46.321
Grimm pull what?

05:47.440 --> 05:48.601
What about "barn kwena"?

05:50.880 --> 05:52.166
"Child wife."

05:52.280 --> 05:53.770
Back to the Shaphat.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.171
"Grimm pull child wife"?

05:55.240 --> 05:57.208
Try "folgên enti fliohan."

05:57.760 --> 05:59.330
"Follow and flee."

05:59.400 --> 06:01.416
Okay, wait, so if we're
unscrambling this correctly,

06:01.440 --> 06:05.490
"Grimm pull child wife,
follow and flee" means what?

06:06.600 --> 06:08.967
"Release the evil
into the other place."

06:09.120 --> 06:12.522
And it needs a Grimm to pull
something to "follow and flee."

06:12.640 --> 06:14.016
Okay, does that mean
it needs a Grimm

06:14.040 --> 06:15.496
to get him out of
the place he's trapped?

06:15.520 --> 06:18.046
Out of there into here
so he could get Diana!

06:21.720 --> 06:22.801
Oh, my God, what's today?

06:22.880 --> 06:24.041
March 24th.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.881
Oh, my God, that's the day.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.096
That's the day
that was predicted

06:28.120 --> 06:29.216
that the planets would align,

06:29.240 --> 06:30.896
and something very bad
was going to happen.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.730
This is why the skull guy
went after Eve now,

06:33.800 --> 06:35.450
so she would go after him now,

06:35.520 --> 06:37.045
so Nick would go after her now.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.136
So it could use the Grimm
to get here and get Diana.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.322
Okay, we cannot open
any portal for Nick and Eve.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.925
'Cause they won't be
coming back alone.

06:43.440 --> 06:45.408
I'm going in there.
I'm the only one who can.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.562
Look, I'm not so sure.
You may be able to open it,

06:47.640 --> 06:49.840
but it might be possible for
me to go in instead of you.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.496
Okay, I think you're right.

06:53.520 --> 06:54.656
I think you're the only option,

06:54.680 --> 06:57.524
and we should do it,
but you should, like,

06:57.600 --> 06:59.682
have a rope tied
around you or something.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.087
- Hey, what's up?
- Monroe.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.207
Stop what you're doing!

07:02.680 --> 07:04.523
Why? I mean, I think
we found out how to...

07:04.600 --> 07:06.056
Stop what you're doing.
We can't open the portal.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.923
It needs Nick
to go through so it can.

07:16.640 --> 07:17.846
- Diana!
- Diana! No!

07:17.920 --> 07:19.445
No, no, no! Don't open it!

07:19.520 --> 07:20.760
No, Diana!

07:20.840 --> 07:21.841
Close it! Close it!

07:21.960 --> 07:23.200
Diana! Stop!

07:23.400 --> 07:24.845
Oh, my God,
I think we're too late.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.326
Nick, it's opening!

07:31.960 --> 07:32.961
Eve!

07:36.400 --> 07:38.243
Nick! Eve!

08:29.680 --> 08:31.125
Eve! Nick!

08:31.200 --> 08:32.361
Diana.

08:32.919 --> 08:35.001
Nick! Oh, my God!

08:35.080 --> 08:37.890
Mommy, it worked.
I got Nick back for you.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.530
Yes, you did.

08:40.840 --> 08:43.081
Diana, are you okay?

08:43.840 --> 08:45.046
I'm okay, Dad.

08:47.600 --> 08:48.681
I'm so glad you're okay.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.649
What happened?
Diana used the stick.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.280
I don't think
that's such a good thing.

08:53.320 --> 08:56.767
I mean, you guys are back,
and that's a good thing,

08:56.840 --> 08:57.887
but Rosalee said...

08:57.960 --> 08:59.246
What?

08:59.800 --> 09:01.040
She said not to open the portal

09:01.080 --> 09:02.480
'cause you wouldn't
come back alone.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.486
Are we alone?

09:04.880 --> 09:05.881
Seems like it.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.525
Whatever tried
to piggyback a ride

09:08.600 --> 09:09.776
probably didn't stand a chance

09:09.800 --> 09:12.531
'cause the mirror's, like,
totally shattered, so...

09:13.480 --> 09:14.561
You're not Woged.

09:16.400 --> 09:17.686
I didn't feel it change.

09:17.960 --> 09:19.564
Nick!

09:20.400 --> 09:22.402
- Oh, Monroe!
- Eve!

09:22.480 --> 09:23.481
What happened?

09:23.560 --> 09:25.164
Everyone's okay. Okay, wait.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.321
Skull Guy's not here?

09:27.160 --> 09:28.241
Nobody came back with them?

09:28.320 --> 09:30.846
Well, no,
but look at the mirror.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.403
God, maybe the book was wrong.

09:54.960 --> 09:55.960
Why did you call me

09:56.000 --> 09:57.320
to tell me not to
open the portal?

09:57.360 --> 09:58.930
I mean, what did you find out?

09:59.360 --> 10:00.407
Nick.

10:01.680 --> 10:02.761
We think you were tricked.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.365
By Skull Guy.

10:05.280 --> 10:08.090
He was there. We were
trying to kill him.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.604
He could've killed us,
but he didn't.

10:10.680 --> 10:12.416
No, he needed you there to
open the way from his side

10:12.440 --> 10:13.965
so he could cross over with you.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.281
This day was predicted from
all the symbols on the cloth.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.522
We think that everything
is supposed to happen today,

10:18.760 --> 10:20.000
March 24th.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.206
Wait. Did he follow you here?

10:24.720 --> 10:26.210
I don't know.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.364
Well, then maybe
he didn't make it here,

10:28.480 --> 10:29.720
as predicted.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.849
We better hope he didn't.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.251
Ten bucks, regular.

11:39.880 --> 11:40.881
It's the perfect storm.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.371
So Skull Face lured Eve to him,

11:42.440 --> 11:43.805
using her as bait for Nick,

11:43.880 --> 11:46.406
allowing him to hitchhike here.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.209
And the hitchhiker
didn't need a guide

11:48.280 --> 11:49.281
to this galaxy.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.169
He just needed a Grimm.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.241
Well, we could be wrong.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.402
I mean, I'm not fluent
in Althochdeutsch,

11:54.480 --> 11:55.480
and Internet translators

11:55.520 --> 11:57.280
aren't the most reliable
things in the world.

11:57.720 --> 11:58.767
But if you're right,

11:58.840 --> 12:00.444
and this is all in
some old Grimm book,

12:00.520 --> 12:02.249
that means this could
be predetermined.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.367
We're talking fate?

12:03.440 --> 12:04.771
Yeah, in a way,

12:05.560 --> 12:07.722
which, of course,

12:07.800 --> 12:10.041
means this conversation

12:10.120 --> 12:11.167
was supposed to be.

12:14.920 --> 12:15.921
Okay, this is one big

12:16.000 --> 12:17.161
existential migraine.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.451
What was it like there?

12:20.040 --> 12:21.530
It was a lot like
the Black Forest.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.921
You mean, where we found the stick?
Yeah.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.248
It was actually beautiful,

12:27.360 --> 12:29.488
except there were
Woged Wesen everywhere.

12:29.600 --> 12:30.886
They were Woged all the time?

12:31.720 --> 12:33.006
Even after they died.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.081
Oh, lordy, lordy!

12:34.160 --> 12:36.447
This sounds a lot
like my family Bible.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.727
"A beautiful place
overrun by beasts"

12:38.800 --> 12:40.928
"where the fires of
hell rage within."

12:41.000 --> 12:42.240
Close enough from what we saw.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.528
Was there anybody else
there besides Wesen?

12:45.600 --> 12:47.489
There were people.
Very primitive.

12:47.560 --> 12:50.404
They called anyone
who wasn't Wesen.

12:50.480 --> 12:51.561
"Gehfleisch."

12:51.640 --> 12:52.920
I'm sorry. They called you what?

12:53.000 --> 12:54.161
You know that?

12:54.240 --> 12:56.766
No, but I can translate it.
It means "walking meat."

12:56.880 --> 12:58.086
They spoke German?

12:58.160 --> 12:59.446
That's sort of what we heard.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.602
That's probably what Zerstörer
had in mind for us.

13:01.680 --> 13:02.681
Zerstörer?

13:02.800 --> 13:04.609
Zerstörer,
that means "destroyer."

13:04.720 --> 13:06.576
That's what they call
Skull Man in the other place,

13:06.600 --> 13:08.887
and they were all
terrified of him.

13:09.040 --> 13:13.602
He was very tall,
he had green eyes,

13:13.680 --> 13:15.364
and he was carrying
a very powerful staff.

13:21.360 --> 13:22.600
You're different now.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.401
What?

13:26.400 --> 13:28.323
I think part of you
stayed in the other place.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.280
Do you feel different?

13:34.000 --> 13:36.082
I don't know.
I guess a little bit.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.161
I don't feel it.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.411
It's gone.

13:52.920 --> 13:54.649
She's not a Hexenbiest anymore.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.570
Okay, isn't this a good thing?

13:56.760 --> 13:58.250
I don't know.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.445
Maybe it is.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.524
None of us are
who we used to be.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.481
Diana?

14:12.120 --> 14:13.804
What's wrong? You okay?

14:13.880 --> 14:16.770
No, no, no!

14:21.120 --> 14:24.727
He's coming!
He's coming! He's coming!

14:25.120 --> 14:26.416
He's coming!
He's coming! He's coming!

14:26.440 --> 14:27.456
You're safe. You're safe.
It's okay.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.005
He's coming!

14:29.760 --> 14:31.125
He's coming!

15:28.000 --> 15:30.685
Hey. The bathroom's
for customers only, so...

15:35.360 --> 15:37.442
I don't want any
trouble, so just...

15:43.640 --> 15:45.051
He's here.

15:47.960 --> 15:51.726
Honey, we're not going to let
anything happen to you, okay?

15:51.800 --> 15:55.361
Don't let him find me. Please,
don't let him find me.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.486
Do you know where he is?

16:01.920 --> 16:03.081
We'll protect you.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.601
No matter what.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.769
You're safe. I promise.

16:06.880 --> 16:07.881
All of us.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.723
We're not gonna let
anybody near you.

16:13.120 --> 16:16.169
Honey, come with me,
okay? Come on.

16:22.520 --> 16:24.727
I spoke to my Russian friend.

16:25.520 --> 16:26.681
They showed me the tunnel.

16:26.760 --> 16:28.000
And the stick.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.320
We told him everything, Nick.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.289
His friend has reason to believe

16:31.360 --> 16:33.567
that this Zerstörer guy
is after Diana.

16:33.680 --> 16:36.081
Now, there's a prophecy about
something called a Shaphat.

16:36.440 --> 16:37.965
A child bride for evil.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.600
I'm not letting that thing
anywhere near my daughter.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.011
You and Adalind
need to hide her.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.844
Zerstörer has connected
with Eve and you

16:44.920 --> 16:46.251
in your loft, so that's out.

16:46.320 --> 16:47.816
And he connected with Eve
in the Spice Shop,

16:47.840 --> 16:49.649
so I don't really
trust that place, either.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.609
There's Renard's or maybe here.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.409
No, there's no safe place.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.005
I know exactly
where you can hide her.

16:57.040 --> 16:58.246
Where?

16:59.120 --> 17:00.326
The cabin in the woods

17:00.400 --> 17:01.496
where all of this first started.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.045
You mean,
where I took you to find

17:03.120 --> 17:04.963
that postman who kidnapped
the little girl?

17:08.520 --> 17:09.601
That's his place.

17:12.119 --> 17:14.487
Exactly. And where you
gave me the key.

17:15.800 --> 17:16.800
Nick!

17:18.040 --> 17:20.041
I brought the key. Here!

17:20.119 --> 17:22.327
I'm giving it back to you.
It's why I called you here.

17:25.319 --> 17:26.845
If Zerstörer finds us there,

17:26.920 --> 17:28.215
we're gonna be too far
to get any help.

17:28.240 --> 17:29.890
None of us are connected
to that cabin

17:29.960 --> 17:31.883
in any way that
he'll ever know about.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.645
Yeah, but he might just be
connected to Diana anyway.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.722
You know, like how
he found Eve and then you.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.609
Then it doesn't matter
where we hide her.

17:38.680 --> 17:41.206
Okay, well, is there some
way we can camouflage her?

17:41.360 --> 17:43.296
I think there might be a way
to make her invisible to him.

17:43.320 --> 17:44.810
The Nuukh Suens.

17:44.880 --> 17:45.881
You know it?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.240
Yeah, my mother used it on me,

17:47.320 --> 17:48.924
more than once,
when I was a child.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.246
Yeah, it's seven herbs.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.243
The sete ervas
ground into a powder

17:52.320 --> 17:54.243
and used with a nazar,
the evil eye charm.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.209
When a Hexenbiest
administers it,

17:56.280 --> 17:58.282
it conceals the child
from harm coming its way.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.601
It worked for me, I think.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.816
The Royals were looking for me,
and they never found me, so...

18:02.840 --> 18:04.604
I have an old bracelet
with a nazar in it.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.056
I'm pretty sure we have
all the herbs here.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.730
I'm gonna go check.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.723
What did you guys do
with the books?

18:09.800 --> 18:11.816
I want to find out as much
as I can about Zerstörer.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.649
In the cellar. We left
them out and open.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.484
We were kind of
in a hurry to get here.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.329
- Rosalee and I will go with you.
- No.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.607
If Zerstörer is connected
to me, I should go alone.

18:19.680 --> 18:21.887
No, none of us
are doing anything alone.

18:21.960 --> 18:23.371
Wu and I can go to the precinct

18:23.440 --> 18:25.442
and see if the Zerstörer
came through.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.966
I'm sure wherever it was,
somebody had to notice.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.530
Yeah, I bet he's hard to miss.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.209
This can't be good.

19:20.880 --> 19:23.087
I'm taking you somewhere
to hide Diana.

19:23.160 --> 19:24.161
I'm not leaving you.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.766
You can't stay with me.
It's not safe.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.605
I'll be there.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.330
I won't let this thing
anywhere near us.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.681
And Rosalee's making
something to shield Diana.

19:34.160 --> 19:35.161
The Nuukh Suens.

19:37.360 --> 19:38.930
That could work,

19:39.720 --> 19:41.484
and I guess the safest
place for Diana

19:41.560 --> 19:43.244
is the safest place for Kelly.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.084
Hey. Guys,
I've got the stuff we need.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.564
It's not going to hurt, is it?

20:20.640 --> 20:22.608
Nope. No, not at all.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.680
You know, my mom used it
on me when I was your age.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.323
You should probably do this.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.086
Okay-

20:33.920 --> 20:35.649
Okay, here we go.

20:37.080 --> 20:39.367
Just think of it as fairy dust.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.682
Mom, there's no such
thing as fairies.

20:42.640 --> 20:43.971
I forgot.

20:44.520 --> 20:46.841
Stand up. Close your eyes.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.682
Okay, you can open them.

21:07.360 --> 21:09.886
Is that it?
I didn't feel anything.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.121
Well, that's good.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.965
Yeah, sometimes it's a very good
thing not to feel anything.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.764
We should get going.

21:53.400 --> 21:54.845
This is where
it all started for me.

22:04.880 --> 22:05.881
Where is she?

22:06.440 --> 22:07.521
Grimm.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.729
I've got some pretty
fond memories here, too.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.361
You!

22:22.880 --> 22:24.291
What were you doing here?

22:25.560 --> 22:27.449
Come on, honey. Here we go.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.880
Nick and I met here to settle
our differences about the key.

22:30.320 --> 22:31.890
Oh.

22:32.400 --> 22:33.481
That.

22:33.640 --> 22:36.211
Yeah, we both decided it
couldn't fall into your hands.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.523
When you were working
for the Royals.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.762
That was before I had
a baby with you

22:41.320 --> 22:42.367
or you.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.090
Simpler times.

23:09.800 --> 23:12.041
It doesn't look like
anybody's been in here for years.

23:12.160 --> 23:13.924
What happened to the owner?

23:14.400 --> 23:16.528
He was my first Blutbad.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.720
I assume you didn't
arrest him, then.

23:21.280 --> 23:23.044
He didn't really give us
much of a choice.

23:41.040 --> 23:44.169
That's a pretty bed.
Did a girl live here?

23:46.960 --> 23:48.610
Hank, she's here.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.367
It's okay, honey. We're police.

23:57.280 --> 23:58.361
Not for long.

23:59.280 --> 24:01.089
How long do we have
to stay here?

24:03.680 --> 24:05.205
I'm not sure, honey.

24:05.640 --> 24:07.210
We have to keep you safe.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.522
So he won't find me here?

24:10.080 --> 24:13.368
Hey. He is never
going to find you, okay?

24:13.880 --> 24:15.041
No, he won't.

24:16.480 --> 24:18.480
I'm going back to the
precinct to help Hank and Wu.

24:18.840 --> 24:20.365
Call me if you need anything.

24:27.480 --> 24:29.050
I love you, son.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.728
Nick!

25:03.080 --> 25:05.606
I thought I lost you
once already tonight.

25:06.920 --> 25:08.285
Be careful.

25:27.880 --> 25:29.245
I love you.

25:30.400 --> 25:31.811
I love you.

25:58.160 --> 25:59.160
So far, no reports

25:59.200 --> 26:00.736
of any kind of skull
face guy with a staff.

26:00.760 --> 26:03.081
Okay, well, we just
got a 911 call.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.447
Doesn't say anything about a
skull face guy or a staff,

26:05.520 --> 26:07.010
but we got bodies,

26:07.080 --> 26:09.560
one with his eyes blown out
and a lot of dead bats.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.369
Good enough for me.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.401
I showed this
to Renard and Adalind.

26:15.480 --> 26:19.326
It looks like Zerstörer, and the staff
he's carrying is pretty similar, too.

26:20.480 --> 26:22.881
Except his had
a lot of cracks in it.

26:22.960 --> 26:25.088
Well, I mean, if it's
as old as this one,

26:25.160 --> 26:27.970
it would make sense it had
a bunch of cracks in it.

26:28.040 --> 26:31.442
And then there's Israel,
formerly known as Jacob,

26:31.520 --> 26:34.091
before crossing the River
Jordan with his staff.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.845
- Looks like the same big stick.
- Mmm-hmm.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.650
And here, the one Judah gave

26:38.720 --> 26:40.324
his daughter-in-law, Tamar.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.165
And look at this.

26:43.480 --> 26:44.480
I know that painting.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.124
That's David Victorious
Over Goliath

26:46.200 --> 26:48.601
by Gabriel Joseph
Marie Augustin Ferrier.

26:48.680 --> 26:50.091
Look what David is holding.

26:50.560 --> 26:51.561
Oh, my God.

26:52.120 --> 26:54.327
I thought David killed
Goliath with a slingshot.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.084
He had a staff, too,
but, for some reason,

26:56.160 --> 26:57.764
that part of the story
isn't promoted.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.763
Apparently, David left
this exact staff

26:59.840 --> 27:00.840
to his descendants,

27:00.880 --> 27:02.689
and the Davidic kings
used it as a scepter

27:02.760 --> 27:04.285
until the destruction
of the temple,

27:04.360 --> 27:06.203
when it
miraculously disappeared.

27:31.200 --> 27:34.488
Ch, Trubel! MONROE: Oh,
my God, am I glad to see you!

27:34.560 --> 27:36.376
Where's Nick? I went to the loft.
Nobody's there.

27:36.400 --> 27:37.925
Neither is the stick.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.048
You could not have shown
up at a better time.

27:41.080 --> 27:42.491
What's going on? Is Nick okay?

27:43.720 --> 27:44.720
Well...

27:44.760 --> 27:46.120
We have a lot of
catching up to do.

27:55.600 --> 27:57.967
This is a lot of dead bats.

27:58.040 --> 28:00.122
And yet, I'm not surprised.

28:00.440 --> 28:01.856
I don't think a lot
could surprise us

28:01.880 --> 28:02.881
after the year we've had.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.928
Year? Try "years."

28:05.000 --> 28:06.161
We wish we'd never known?

28:06.240 --> 28:07.241
Not at all.

28:07.320 --> 28:08.440
Unless the real question is,

28:08.480 --> 28:09.880
are we crazy and
don't even know it?

28:09.920 --> 28:11.729
I wish I'd never known that.

28:11.800 --> 28:14.690
Got to say, I'm not a big fan
of bats, dead or otherwise.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.016
You ever seen
anything like this?

28:16.040 --> 28:18.486
How many bodies? Are we
talking bats or people?

28:18.600 --> 28:20.682
Uh, let's start with people.
Two.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.121
First one's in the office.
Apparently electrocuted,

28:23.200 --> 28:25.202
but I can't see
any downed power lines,

28:25.280 --> 28:26.416
and his outfit is a little weird

28:26.440 --> 28:28.169
in the sense that
he's not wearing one.

28:28.280 --> 28:31.124
Naked in a gas station.
That's a dignified way to go.

28:31.360 --> 28:32.600
At least he's got underwear.

28:32.720 --> 28:34.688
What about the second victim?
Men's room.

28:34.760 --> 28:36.922
Bled out from
a big-ass stab wound.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.280
Must have been
a hell of a fight,

28:38.320 --> 28:39.685
shattered the bathroom mirror.

28:40.320 --> 28:41.731
We'll take that one.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.723
See if you can ID
the exhibitionist.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.882
Hate to think about where
he keeps his wallet.

28:51.920 --> 28:55.481
Talk about peeing in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.776
If I didn't know that somebody
could go through a mirror,

29:06.800 --> 29:09.246
and, believe me,
I wish I didn't know that,

29:09.960 --> 29:11.849
I'd think this got
broken in a fight, too.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.968
Let's check out
the underwear guy.

29:21.880 --> 29:25.327
Any guesses
as to where his clothes went?

29:25.400 --> 29:29.610
Well, either this is how he gets
his kicks, or someone took them.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.286
I'm gonna call Nick.
He needs to see this.

29:32.360 --> 29:33.441
Yeah.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.410
I've slept in worse places.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.447
I don't wanna go to bed. Shh.

29:42.680 --> 29:46.127
It's been a long night, and
you haven't slept at all.

29:46.760 --> 29:48.808
Just try to get
some rest, honey.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.170
I'm not tired.

29:51.240 --> 29:53.208
I know. Just try.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.168
We can't hide out here
for the rest of our lives.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.370
We won't have to.

30:06.040 --> 30:07.880
This thing is gonna find
us one way or another,

30:07.920 --> 30:10.571
and when it does,
I'm gonna kill it.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.568
I don't think
it's gonna be that easy.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.210
Neither do I.

30:17.560 --> 30:20.325
But the three of us aren't
gonna be that easy, either.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.161
No, we're not.

30:44.920 --> 30:48.527
Watch it! Are you drunk? Get
out of the road, you idiot!

30:50.600 --> 30:51.931
Watch it!

31:02.040 --> 31:04.441
Why would he come through here?

31:05.320 --> 31:07.243
Maybe it was the
only mirror he could find.

31:07.320 --> 31:09.448
Then the prophecy came true.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.120
Yeah, looks like he was stabbed

31:12.160 --> 31:13.844
with something pretty big.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.336
I guess he brought
the staff with him.

31:15.360 --> 31:17.567
It's probably what he fried
the other victim with.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.563
Hey. Surveillance is up.

31:32.280 --> 31:33.691
Nice stick.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.330
You got any spare change?

31:36.720 --> 31:38.882
Come on, man.
We need some money.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.401
Watch it! Are you drunk?

31:41.480 --> 31:43.562
Damn right, we're drunk.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.847
You got any money or not?

31:46.600 --> 31:48.489
Got any money or not?

31:48.600 --> 31:51.683
Hey, ass-wipe, we're not amused.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.082
Get out of the road, you idiot!

31:54.640 --> 31:57.405
Gonna need a bigger stick
than that, jughead.

32:01.680 --> 32:02.886
What the hell, man?

32:19.480 --> 32:21.050
What the hell?

32:26.560 --> 32:28.085
What the hell?

32:39.320 --> 32:40.606
He must be cold.

32:40.720 --> 32:41.721
Sure looks it.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.290
He's human.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.886
That is not what he looked
like in the other place.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.243
This guy doesn't
look like Skull Guy.

32:48.360 --> 32:49.486
Except for the staff.

32:49.560 --> 32:51.642
Well, maybe this is
his Woged form here.

32:55.160 --> 32:57.162
Okay, where's he going now?

32:57.240 --> 32:58.765
Get a shot of his face.
Put out an APB.

32:58.840 --> 33:00.285
Include the staff
in his description.

33:00.360 --> 33:02.442
- I've got to call Adalind.
- Yeah.

33:09.160 --> 33:10.889
Nick, are you okay?

33:10.960 --> 33:12.291
Yeah, where's Renard?

33:12.360 --> 33:14.010
Uh, he's here. Diana's asleep.

33:14.080 --> 33:16.082
All right, he needs
to hear this-I can.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.406
He's here.

33:17.960 --> 33:19.007
Where?

33:19.080 --> 33:21.128
In Portland-He's already
killed two people-

33:21.200 --> 33:22.361
Oh, my God.

33:22.560 --> 33:25.291
He can Woge
into human form here.

33:25.360 --> 33:26.850
We don't know where he's going,

33:26.920 --> 33:28.616
but we're doing everything
we can to track him down.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.976
He's not gonna be
able to hide for long.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.216
At least not the way
he's acting.

33:31.240 --> 33:32.776
I don't like sitting here
and doing nothing.

33:32.800 --> 33:33.847
We should trade places.

33:33.920 --> 33:35.206
You're not doing nothing.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.360
You're protecting Adalind,
my son, and your daughter.

33:38.120 --> 33:39.485
I'll call you in a few.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.416
Just got a report of a body
under the Hawthorne Bridge,

33:41.440 --> 33:43.602
apparently attacked by
some kind of giant snake.

33:44.240 --> 33:48.450
So this Zerstörer guy
has Moses' staff?

33:49.680 --> 33:52.365
I mean, the Moses? Possibly.

33:52.440 --> 33:56.764
Or the Ruyi Jingu Bang wielded by the
immortal Monkey King, Sun Wukong.

33:56.840 --> 33:59.207
Or the Kaladanda,
the Staff of Death

33:59.280 --> 34:01.169
used by the god Yama
in Hindu mythology.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.521
The point is, it could
be any one of these things

34:03.600 --> 34:05.364
or all of them combined.
We don't...

34:05.480 --> 34:08.643
And this big stick is supposed to
help him make Diana his child bride

34:08.719 --> 34:10.563
and destroy the world
as we know it.

34:10.639 --> 34:11.846
So long story short,

34:11.920 --> 34:14.764
we just have to destroy the
destroyer dude, or we're toast.

34:15.080 --> 34:17.735
There's still something about
Zerstörer's staff that's bothering me.

34:17.760 --> 34:19.808
It was completely cracked up

34:19.880 --> 34:23.521
as if it had been put back together
by a lot of different pieces

34:23.600 --> 34:25.648
and not one of
all of these texts

34:25.719 --> 34:26.920
references anything like that.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.563
Yeah, something bothers me
about it, too.

34:28.639 --> 34:31.085
I mean, if it's as all-powerful
as it's supposed to be

34:31.159 --> 34:32.360
and belonged to all the people

34:32.440 --> 34:33.679
it supposedly belonged to...

34:33.800 --> 34:36.485
Then how did this Zerstörer guy
get his grubby mitts on it?

34:36.560 --> 34:37.800
I was just reading about this.

34:37.880 --> 34:40.724
There's a prophecy about a staff

34:40.800 --> 34:43.690
with the power of the gods,
and it can't be destroyed.

34:43.880 --> 34:45.882
Hang on. Right here.
I got it. I got it.

34:47.159 --> 34:48.286
Na, Na, Na, Na.

34:48.440 --> 34:50.761
"The staff was broken
into 100 pieces"

34:50.840 --> 34:52.239
"and scattered
throughout the world"

34:52.280 --> 34:55.011
"to keep its powers out
of the hands of evil."

34:55.360 --> 34:57.727
Do we think that's
the staff Zerstörer has?

34:57.800 --> 34:59.928
It sure sounds like it,
don't you think?

35:00.000 --> 35:01.923
What if he put all
the pieces back together

35:02.000 --> 35:04.241
before he got trapped
in the other place?

35:05.080 --> 35:07.256
Nick couldn't even get into the
other place without the stick.

35:07.280 --> 35:09.521
What if the stick is a
missing part of the staff?

35:10.320 --> 35:11.685
Oh, my God.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.163
What if the stick we found
in the Black Forest

35:14.240 --> 35:16.083
was actually buried
by the Crusaders

35:16.240 --> 35:19.164
to keep the staff from ever
regaining its full powers?

35:19.240 --> 35:21.846
Maybe that's what
Zerstörer is here for.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.729
I hope we're wrong
'cause if we're right...

35:23.800 --> 35:26.804
Zerstörer is coming for the stick
that Nick has with him right now.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.766
How many ways can this
Zerstörer kill you?

35:31.840 --> 35:33.126
Why this guy?

35:33.200 --> 35:35.248
Must've got in his way.

35:35.360 --> 35:36.771
But why here?

35:36.840 --> 35:39.605
What's this place got to do
with Diana or any of us?

35:40.440 --> 35:41.726
It's Eve.

35:42.720 --> 35:43.926
Yeah. Nick, we need you

35:44.000 --> 35:45.445
to come to the Spice
Shop right now.

35:46.120 --> 35:48.566
- Me or all of us?
- Just you.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.005
All right.

35:51.840 --> 35:53.056
I've got to head back
to the Spice Shop.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.003
Go. We'll take it from here.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.161
Diana, no!

37:16.520 --> 37:18.170
Diana! Honey, wake up.

37:18.280 --> 37:20.248
Diana, wake up. It's okay.
No, it's not!

37:20.320 --> 37:21.496
It's just a dream.
It's just a dream.

37:21.520 --> 37:22.567
No, you don't understand!

37:22.640 --> 37:24.120
What? What don't
we understand, honey?

37:24.160 --> 37:27.448
He doesn't just want me.
He wants my brother, too!

37:28.400 --> 37:30.050
He wants us both.

37:32.320 --> 37:33.526
Honey, come here.

37:33.600 --> 37:35.887
It's okay. It's okay.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.683
What did you find out?

37:46.000 --> 37:47.604
Trubel.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.529
Oh, I'm so glad
you're all right!

37:50.360 --> 37:52.362
When did you get here?
Just today.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.601
What about Black Claw?

37:54.200 --> 37:56.248
Black Claw is done.
The war is over.

37:56.320 --> 37:58.448
There's nothing left?
Every cell was destroyed.

37:58.520 --> 37:59.760
That's not why I'm here.

38:00.040 --> 38:02.560
I came because I had a feeling
something terrible was happening.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.489
It looks like I may be right.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.130
Which takes us to the stick.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.251
We think it's a missing part,

38:08.320 --> 38:11.608
possibly the only missing part
left of Zerstörer's staff.

38:11.680 --> 38:12.680
- What?
- Yeah.

38:12.720 --> 38:14.643
That would explain a lot
because, historically,

38:14.720 --> 38:18.088
there are tons of examples
of things with extreme power

38:18.160 --> 38:19.810
being taken apart.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.201
Like the pyramid in Giza,
the capstone is missing.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.561
Or the myth of Osiris, whose
body was cut into pieces

38:24.640 --> 38:26.608
and then put back together
so that he could rule.

38:26.680 --> 38:29.445
Basically, we think it's why the
Crusaders buried the stick.

38:29.520 --> 38:32.091
And that's why there were so many
cracks in Zerstörer's staff.

38:32.240 --> 38:33.816
And he sure as hell
better not get a hold

38:33.840 --> 38:35.365
of the stick
you and Monroe found.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.536
From what we've been reading,

38:36.560 --> 38:39.291
if this staff ever gets put back
together, he'll be unstoppable.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.451
It's Hank.

38:42.960 --> 38:43.961
What have you got?

38:45.120 --> 38:46.929
I just got a hit on the APB.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.001
He's still in the area.

38:48.080 --> 38:49.764
We're headed back
to the precinct.

38:49.880 --> 38:51.325
I'll meet you there.

38:51.400 --> 38:52.481
Where was this guy?

38:52.600 --> 38:53.681
At the Hawthorne Bridge.

38:53.760 --> 38:54.960
Then that's where I'm heading.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.162
If you see Zerstörer, don't
do anything. Call me.

38:57.240 --> 39:00.005
Nick, whatever you do, don't let
that stick out of your control.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.242
It may be the only power
you have against him.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.563
Just got this
from a surveillance camera

39:14.640 --> 39:16.529
three blocks west
of Hawthorne Bridge.

39:16.600 --> 39:17.681
Any more bodies?

39:17.760 --> 39:18.760
Not that we know of.

39:18.800 --> 39:21.280
I tried shooting this guy in his world.
It didn't work.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.771
He's in our world now.

39:23.640 --> 39:24.721
Let's weapon up.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.968
As many as we can carry.

39:34.600 --> 39:37.126
Help!

39:39.600 --> 39:40.601
Help!

40:01.000 --> 40:02.161
Two officers down.

40:02.280 --> 40:04.442
Southeast Third and Main-Backup
needed-

40:06.200 --> 40:07.247
Burkhardt.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.084
I just saw him.
He killed two cops.

40:09.160 --> 40:11.811
Trubel, are you near
Southeast Third and Main?

40:11.880 --> 40:13.325
Oh, I was. I'm following him,

40:13.400 --> 40:15.209
and we're not far
from the precinct.

40:15.280 --> 40:16.856
He's headed your
direction, but I lost him.

40:16.880 --> 40:17.927
Stay away from him.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.809
We're on our way.

40:19.880 --> 40:22.929
Trubel's here? Yeah, I saw
her at the Spice Shop.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.805
Wu!

41:05.400 --> 41:07.402
Nick... Nick...

41:08.560 --> 41:09.721
Nick... No!

41:12.280 --> 41:13.327
No!

41:26.280 --> 41:28.282
You're gonna die,
you son of a bitch!

41:58.800 --> 41:59.801
No!

42:00.480 --> 42:01.527
No!

42:06.480 --> 42:07.527
No!
