00:11.098 --> 00:13.926
-  A long time ago,
there were legends in the west.

00:15.450 --> 00:16.929
Law men and outlaws alike.

00:19.019 --> 00:22.022
Some legends, some stories,
were better left untold.

00:25.590 --> 00:28.376
But sometimes, the past has
a way of finding the light.

00:30.421 --> 00:31.466
- Señor.

00:31.640 --> 00:32.510
They're coming.

00:33.816 --> 00:36.123
Willie Price, a
very dangerous man.

00:36.297 --> 00:37.950
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

00:53.836 --> 00:57.013
- Whatever happens,
don't come outside.

01:42.319 --> 01:43.755
- Hello Colt.

01:43.929 --> 01:45.366
- I see you got my invitation.

01:46.845 --> 01:48.064
- Oh I got it all right.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.635
You know it's a shame what
you did there to Tommy.

01:53.809 --> 01:55.115
He was one of my brightest.

01:57.552 --> 01:58.727
- You got my condolences.

02:05.081 --> 02:06.474
- So now what?

02:06.648 --> 02:08.128
- I'm tired of huntin' vermin.

02:10.391 --> 02:12.044
It's time to end this,

02:12.219 --> 02:14.395
right here, right now.

02:18.573 --> 02:20.270
- You hear that boys?

02:20.444 --> 02:23.882
The slayer here is
tired of huntin' vermin.

02:26.624 --> 02:28.583
Now those are some
pretty harsh words.

02:32.195 --> 02:33.544
I hope you can back 'em up.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.810
- Only one way to find out.

02:41.639 --> 02:42.640
- That's enough.

02:44.164 --> 02:47.036
Colt I warned you not to
bring this fight here boy.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.951
- Sheriff.

02:49.125 --> 02:51.910
With all respect, you better
stay the hell out of this one.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.176
- I don't think so, son.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.918
This is still my town.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.401
William Price, you
are under arrest

03:04.575 --> 03:06.534
for murder and robbery.

03:06.708 --> 03:09.624
And you will stand before the
judge come Monday morning.

03:16.631 --> 03:19.329
- I never argue with
a man of the law.

03:20.461 --> 03:25.335
Well, I guess we
better surrender, boys.

03:31.254 --> 03:33.517
- Sheriff, you need to
get your ass inside now.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.220
- You brought this
upon yourself.

03:45.834 --> 03:46.791
- What?

03:50.447 --> 03:55.322
Get on at 'em boys.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.158
- Willie!

04:46.198 --> 04:48.200
- Are you scared, slick?

04:49.811 --> 04:50.899
'Cause you should be!

05:03.868 --> 05:08.090
- Remember this?

05:08.264 --> 05:10.440
You should, because
it's gonna send you back

05:10.614 --> 05:12.573
where you belong.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.286
You.

06:15.984 --> 06:17.464
I did everything you asked.

06:18.508 --> 06:19.553
It's finished!

06:21.337 --> 06:22.382
Now end this.

09:06.328 --> 09:07.982
- Uh, good mornin' sunshine.

09:11.028 --> 09:11.812
- Morning.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.167
Some storm we had
last night, huh?

09:21.169 --> 09:22.257
- Yeah, it sure was.

09:26.217 --> 09:28.263
Forget we had dinner
plans here last night?

09:28.437 --> 09:30.004
- Sorry.

09:30.178 --> 09:31.309
It turned out to be a late
night at the hospital,

09:31.483 --> 09:32.963
you know, with
the storm and all.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.008
- Mhm.

09:35.183 --> 09:37.489
Your shift ended what,
a couple hours ago?

09:37.664 --> 09:38.969
- Yeah, well I had
some shopping to do.

09:39.143 --> 09:40.362
You know, our daughter's
coming in this weekend,

09:40.536 --> 09:42.016
in case you forgot.

09:42.190 --> 09:43.800
- No, I didn't forget.

09:43.974 --> 09:45.889
I'm just sayin', two
hours seems like a long

09:46.063 --> 09:47.325
time to do your shoppin'.

09:47.499 --> 09:48.936
- You really wanna
do this right now?

09:49.110 --> 09:50.851
- I'm making an observation.
- No you're not.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.417
You're accusing me of something.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.854
- Karen, I'm not
accusing you of anything.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.551
I'm saying your shift
ended at five am

09:55.725 --> 09:57.248
and it's 7:30.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.076
- Well he's a cop, chief.
- Oh come on, come on.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.338
- I'm going to bed.

10:04.516 --> 10:05.822
I don't want Emily
to know that we're

10:05.996 --> 10:08.695
having problems, so, can
we just pretend to get

10:08.869 --> 10:10.479
along while she's here, please?

10:11.349 --> 10:12.829
- Sure.

10:13.003 --> 10:13.787
- Thanks.

10:21.838 --> 10:22.622
- Hardy.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.235
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

10:27.409 --> 10:29.367
Meg, Meg say that again.

10:32.501 --> 10:33.371
I'll be right there.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.059
- Please.

11:09.233 --> 11:10.060
Help me.

11:16.763 --> 11:17.633
- Mornin' Terry.

11:17.807 --> 11:18.721
- Sheriff.

11:18.895 --> 11:19.896
Got ourselves a weird one here.

11:20.070 --> 11:21.071
- Mornin' Ethan.

11:21.245 --> 11:22.769
Glad you could finally join us.

11:23.944 --> 11:24.858
Hey, when did you start
wearing the badge on

11:25.032 --> 11:26.555
the wrong side of your shirt?

11:26.729 --> 11:29.471
- The day I started to
resent this miserable job.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.516
- I'm sure we could
rectify that for ya.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.344
- Keep trying, Dwayne.

11:33.518 --> 11:35.085
Got your head so far
up the mayor's ass,

11:35.259 --> 11:36.826
I'm gonna fill out a missing
persons report on you.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.610
- That's good, I like it.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.351
- Can we clear all these
people out of here, please?

11:40.525 --> 11:41.309
- Yeah folks, come on, let's go.

11:41.483 --> 11:42.136
-  Go on home.

11:43.311 --> 11:44.660
- Thank you, appreciate it.

11:45.574 --> 11:46.357
Appreciate it.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.503
Well, Sandra Baker called it in.

12:03.026 --> 12:03.940
Apparently she was watching
the kids while the Neelon's

12:04.114 --> 12:06.029
were out of town on business.

12:06.203 --> 12:08.031
She says the snuck out
early this morning,

12:08.205 --> 12:12.470
saw the coffins and
unfortunately, found the body.

12:14.342 --> 12:15.299
Ethan, there's
something else though--

12:15.473 --> 12:16.736
- Yeah, put a pin in it.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.346
I don't want these
kids seeing this.

12:19.260 --> 12:20.087
- Sure.

12:35.276 --> 12:36.277
- Mornin', doc.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.235
- Mornin' to you, too, Ethan.

12:38.409 --> 12:40.803
They say our jobs are
boring here in Temple Wells.

12:42.762 --> 12:46.113
You better brace yourself.

12:47.592 --> 12:48.724
- Good God All Mighty.

12:51.509 --> 12:52.902
Who is that?

12:53.076 --> 12:54.077
Is that Burt Thompson?

12:54.251 --> 12:54.991
- The one and only.

12:55.165 --> 12:56.166
- Jesus.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.038
- Heartbreaking isn't it?

12:58.212 --> 12:59.953
He's been fishing
out here for years.

13:02.869 --> 13:05.001
- What would cause all that?

13:05.175 --> 13:07.699
- It depends on the
answer you're looking for.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.527
- How is that?

13:09.701 --> 13:11.573
- Well it's a viscous
attack, sheriff.

13:12.443 --> 13:13.793
- An animal?

13:13.967 --> 13:15.577
- On any other given
day I would say yes.

13:16.708 --> 13:17.797
- What does that mean?

13:19.276 --> 13:21.975
- Well if it were an animal,
it'd have to be smart one,

13:23.454 --> 13:25.065
with a knowledge of human
anatomy because every

13:25.239 --> 13:27.328
major organ was severed.

13:27.502 --> 13:28.720
Very concisely.

13:30.026 --> 13:30.810
- Cover him up.

13:34.422 --> 13:36.076
I wanna keep this quiet.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.338
- My thoughts exactly.

13:38.295 --> 13:39.079
- Thank you doc.

13:42.560 --> 13:43.344
Sandra.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.347
- I must've dozed off, Ethan.

13:46.521 --> 13:48.349
I mean, I didn't even know
that they were even gone

13:48.523 --> 13:50.220
until Terry called.

13:50.394 --> 13:52.179
I mean between
working at the dinner,

13:52.353 --> 13:55.225
watching the kids,
I'm really sorry.

13:55.399 --> 13:56.966
- It's not your fault,
don't worry about it.

13:57.140 --> 13:58.402
Can I talk to that
little one there?

13:58.576 --> 13:59.926
- It's okay darling,
he's the sheriff.

14:01.971 --> 14:04.539
- Come down here sweetheart,
let me ask you a question.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.629
Can you uh, can you
remember what you saw?

14:09.718 --> 14:10.893
- They were monsters.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.460
-  Monsters?

14:12.634 --> 14:13.983
- They weren't monsters.

14:14.157 --> 14:16.333
- No that's okay, that's okay.

14:16.507 --> 14:17.987
Monsters.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.293
Well what kind of
monsters were they?

14:19.467 --> 14:20.860
Can you tell me?

14:21.034 --> 14:23.775
- They had big teeth
and long, sharp claws.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.952
- They were werewolves, retard.

14:26.126 --> 14:26.909
- Okay.

14:28.128 --> 14:28.911
Werewolves.

14:31.435 --> 14:32.828
I think we got
about all we need.

14:33.002 --> 14:34.569
You get 'em home, I'll
contact the parents

14:34.743 --> 14:35.657
to come home early.

14:36.876 --> 14:37.833
If there's anything
else, we'll call ya.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.313
- I appreciate it sheriff.

14:39.487 --> 14:40.183
- Sure.

14:40.357 --> 14:41.141
Thank you dear.

14:42.577 --> 14:43.491
- All right Sandra.

14:43.665 --> 14:45.188
Thanks kids.
- Come on kids.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.500
I don't know, but,

14:53.849 --> 14:55.546
I'd say these coffins
have to be at least

14:55.720 --> 14:57.461
over a hundred years old.

14:57.635 --> 14:59.159
-  Yeah.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.029
-  Something
to do with the storm

15:00.203 --> 15:00.725
we had last night, huh?

15:02.205 --> 15:04.773
- Maybe the storm's what
brought 'em to the surface?

15:04.947 --> 15:06.122
- Possibility.

15:07.558 --> 15:09.865
- I don't know about you
Ethan, but, I'd feel a whole

15:10.039 --> 15:12.694
lot better if there were
some bones in these coffins.

15:12.868 --> 15:14.304
- Yeah, and if it didn't
look like somethin' clawed

15:14.478 --> 15:15.653
its way out of 'em.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.700
Get on the horn and
have some good old boys

15:18.874 --> 15:20.354
come down and haul
these out of the water,

15:20.528 --> 15:22.399
get 'em down to the station.
- Absolutely.

15:30.712 --> 15:33.845
♪ A relationship with
you is just like ♪

15:34.020 --> 15:38.981

16:00.046 --> 16:00.872
Check this out.

16:02.831 --> 16:04.746
-  What's
with this sideshow?

16:04.920 --> 16:08.663
- I don't know, let's
say we find out.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.416
Hey, what's your trip, bro?

16:25.419 --> 16:26.202
- Trip?

16:28.248 --> 16:29.031
Bro?

16:29.901 --> 16:31.251
- Oh, look.

16:31.425 --> 16:35.907
We got us a comedian in
our midst.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.257
- My, my, my.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.912
From the heavens above.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.003
Now what do we have here?

16:45.569 --> 16:47.310
- Hey.

16:47.484 --> 16:50.270
You wanna tell your boy to
get his paws off my Caroline?

16:51.575 --> 16:52.924
- Caroline.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.274
Is that what you call it?

16:56.754 --> 16:58.278
You know, I knew
a Caroline once.

16:59.322 --> 17:02.108
She was a wild one.

17:02.282 --> 17:03.544
- You know what?

17:03.718 --> 17:05.633
You're startin' to
piss me off, bro.

17:08.636 --> 17:09.811
- My apologies.

17:09.985 --> 17:13.423
I am, um, I'm new to your world.

17:13.597 --> 17:15.512
- Well I have a suggestion:
why don't you take

17:15.686 --> 17:17.819
your little band of
sissies and take a hike?

17:17.993 --> 17:19.995
This is Black Cross territory.

17:21.779 --> 17:23.781
- Did he just call us sissies?

17:23.955 --> 17:25.305
- I think he did.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.185
- Heck are you doin', man?

17:42.670 --> 17:43.671
- He killed him!

17:43.845 --> 17:44.715
He killed the Judge!

17:48.937 --> 17:51.287
- It's nothing personal, bro!

18:22.492 --> 18:23.450
- Lucy!
- Hi.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.931
- It's so good to see you.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.716
- I thought you weren't
coming 'til Friday.

18:28.890 --> 18:30.109
- Lucy, it is Friday.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.502
- Right.

18:32.676 --> 18:36.637
Oh, god, I'm sorry, I've
just been really off.

18:36.811 --> 18:37.464
How are you doing?

18:37.638 --> 18:38.291
How's school?

18:38.465 --> 18:39.814
- It's good.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.642
A girl can only take
so many frat parties

18:41.816 --> 18:43.078
and jello shots.

18:43.252 --> 18:44.819
- I can imagine.

18:44.993 --> 18:47.126
Oh, it's really good to see you.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.736
I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

18:48.910 --> 18:51.869
You know what,
speaking of shots,

18:52.043 --> 18:53.741
I could really use
one before I face

18:53.915 --> 18:55.438
my pill popping mother.

18:55.612 --> 18:57.048
- Oh um, you know what?

18:57.223 --> 18:59.094
Let's actually, I was
gonna go to The Nest.

18:59.268 --> 19:00.878
Let's just meet there
in a few minutes.

19:01.052 --> 19:03.316
- But shots are free here.

19:03.490 --> 19:04.578
Why don't we--

19:04.752 --> 19:05.666
- Um.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.712
I just wanna get out
of the house, you know?

19:08.886 --> 19:10.714
- Wait, since when
can I not come in?

19:12.063 --> 19:13.630
And you seem nervous?

19:13.804 --> 19:15.415
Like why do you keep
looking over your shoulder?

19:15.589 --> 19:17.939
- No I'm not nervous,
I'm not nervous.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.811
- You have a guy in
there, don't you?

19:20.985 --> 19:23.205
- It's not like that.
- You slut.

19:23.379 --> 19:24.728
Why didn't you just say so?
- Shut up.

19:24.902 --> 19:25.860
- Okay.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.775
Okay.

19:27.949 --> 19:31.648
You just go back to doing
whatever it is you were doing,

19:31.822 --> 19:33.955
or whoever you were doing.
- There is no--

19:34.129 --> 19:37.611
- And I will go say hello
to my soul crushing parents.

19:42.311 --> 19:44.313
- Hey, don't say anything.

20:27.138 --> 20:28.009
- Where am I?

20:29.489 --> 20:30.751
Where are my clothes?

20:30.925 --> 20:33.841
- It's okay, I have
your things right here.

20:34.015 --> 20:35.886
What I could salvage, anyway.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.192
- My necklace.

20:39.673 --> 20:40.500
- It's right here.

20:46.332 --> 20:47.202
Are you all right?

20:51.685 --> 20:52.773
- The year is...

21:01.956 --> 21:03.174
- They belonged to my husband.

21:03.349 --> 21:04.219
They should fit.

21:09.877 --> 21:11.357
- Good.

21:11.531 --> 21:13.402
I'm gonna need steel, and iron.

21:31.377 --> 21:32.726
Oh, these'll do.

21:37.078 --> 21:38.819
- What do you
think you're doin'?

21:43.563 --> 21:44.999
- You got silver bullets?

21:45.173 --> 21:46.957
- Yeah, actually, I do.

21:47.131 --> 21:48.655
Why, are you huntin' werewolves?

21:50.874 --> 21:52.093
- How far to Canyon Creek?

21:53.312 --> 21:54.530
- Canyon Creek?

21:54.704 --> 21:55.575
Canyon Creek doesn't
exist anymore.

21:55.749 --> 21:56.750
It's Temple Wells now.

21:56.924 --> 21:58.708
- How far?

21:58.882 --> 21:59.927
- 15 minutes.

22:00.754 --> 22:01.537
- Good.

22:04.410 --> 22:05.324
I'll need a horse.

22:12.461 --> 22:13.897
There used to be
stories about the future

22:14.071 --> 22:16.073
having machines just like this.

22:16.247 --> 22:18.380
These horseless carriages.

22:19.555 --> 22:21.122
What do you call it?

22:21.296 --> 22:23.124
- Most people would just
call this a piece of junk.

22:25.561 --> 22:28.085
Have you really never
driven a truck before?

22:28.259 --> 22:30.697
- I've never seen
a truck before.

22:32.481 --> 22:33.874
It must seem strange to you.

22:35.005 --> 22:37.617
- Oh no, nothin'
about you is strange.

22:38.574 --> 22:40.315
So where exactly
am I taking you?

22:42.143 --> 22:43.231
- Take me to a saloon.

22:44.406 --> 22:45.364
- A saloon?

22:46.539 --> 22:47.540
Like a bar?

22:48.454 --> 22:49.716
Why do you wanna go there?

22:50.978 --> 22:52.501
- Well how else do
you get information?

22:53.676 --> 22:55.112
- I don't know, the internet?

22:56.113 --> 22:57.245
- Inter-what?

22:59.682 --> 23:01.336
- All right.

23:01.510 --> 23:04.165
Listen dude, you and I are
gonna make a deal right now.

23:04.339 --> 23:06.385
I'm gonna take you to
the saloon so you can

23:06.559 --> 23:10.693
get your information
and then this is done.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.782
And we're just gonna
go our separate ways.

23:12.956 --> 23:14.088
Deal?

23:14.262 --> 23:15.176
- You have my word.

23:16.569 --> 23:17.396
- All right then.

23:18.527 --> 23:19.876
Now I'm gonna start this engine

23:20.050 --> 23:22.879
and it's gonna be loud,
so, try not to shoot me.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.723
So did you like escape
from some kind of

23:40.897 --> 23:43.422
government research
facility or somethin'?

23:43.596 --> 23:44.335
- What?

23:44.510 --> 23:45.336
No.

23:46.773 --> 23:51.125
I come from a place,
well, far away from here.

23:51.299 --> 23:52.213
- Okay.

23:54.345 --> 23:55.390
Well you got a name?

23:56.304 --> 23:57.914
- James Franklin Colt, Jr.

23:58.088 --> 24:01.396
- Well, James Franklin Colt,
Jr., you don't seem like

24:01.570 --> 24:02.789
much of a criminal to me.

24:04.704 --> 24:06.314
Did you escape from a hospital?

24:07.402 --> 24:08.447
Do you have issues?

24:09.752 --> 24:11.145
- How are we able
to move this fast?

24:12.842 --> 24:14.583
- Well, the pedal on
the left makes us stop,

24:14.757 --> 24:16.672
and the pedal on the
right makes us go.

24:17.847 --> 24:19.675
Consider that your
first driving lesson.

24:21.547 --> 24:22.548
- Looks easy enough.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.467
Don't worry, I'm no hard case.

24:28.641 --> 24:29.555
I mean you no harm.

24:33.254 --> 24:34.516
- Well that's good to know.

24:37.867 --> 24:41.305
You know, Temple Wells
isn't much to see anymore.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.873
Used to be a mining
town back in the 1800s.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.267
- I know.

25:17.472 --> 25:19.256
- Woo hoo hoo!

25:19.430 --> 25:20.780
Yeah!

25:20.954 --> 25:22.303
Thing kicks like an ex-wife.

25:24.218 --> 25:25.262
- Always a pleasure, Mr. Mayor.

25:25.436 --> 25:26.568
- Yeah it is.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.048
- Mornin', Bob.

25:28.222 --> 25:29.310
- I'll see my way out.

25:30.311 --> 25:31.617
- Yeah you do that.

25:31.791 --> 25:32.661
- And you know that'll
illegal as hell,

25:32.835 --> 25:34.141
don't you, Mr. Mayor?

25:34.315 --> 25:36.273
- Well I figure
it's a little illegal.

25:36.447 --> 25:39.233
Everything is, though, isn't it?

25:39.407 --> 25:40.190
Ethan.

25:41.757 --> 25:43.846
You look like a man that's
got somethin' on his mind.

25:44.020 --> 25:47.023
So why don't you say what
you came out here to say?

25:49.852 --> 25:51.332
Son of a bitch.

25:51.506 --> 25:53.290
- No see, you're pullin' it.

25:53.464 --> 25:54.161
You gotta squeeze it.

25:54.335 --> 25:55.423
- Eh.

25:55.597 --> 25:56.859
I think it's just the gun.

25:58.121 --> 25:59.819
- I did come out here
to tell you somethin'.

25:59.993 --> 26:00.863
Somethin' serious.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.954
- Well I figure serious
best be rinsed down

26:05.128 --> 26:06.652
with a cocktail, don't you?

26:07.957 --> 26:09.437
Let's move inside.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.050
Well.

26:14.224 --> 26:15.835
I'm not under arrest am I?

26:16.009 --> 26:17.532
- Uh no.

26:17.706 --> 26:18.794
- Well.

26:18.968 --> 26:20.100
Then I'm all ears.

26:20.274 --> 26:21.275
What do you got?

26:21.449 --> 26:22.537
- Well you know Burt Thompson.

26:24.408 --> 26:25.496
Well Burt's dead.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.847
- Oh shit.

26:28.021 --> 26:29.370
- You think that's funny?

26:29.544 --> 26:31.764
- Jesus Christ, Ethan,
look at your face.

26:33.026 --> 26:34.941
You'd think the Marines
had landed or some shit.

26:35.115 --> 26:36.420
He's the town drunk.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.813
I'm surprised he
lasted that long,

26:37.987 --> 26:40.163
been chuggin' turpentine
his whole damn life.

26:40.337 --> 26:41.469
- He was murdered, Bob.

26:43.036 --> 26:45.516
I mean, I think
that's odd, don't you?

26:45.691 --> 26:48.650
That'd be the first homicide
in this little town in,

26:49.695 --> 26:52.436
well ever, as far as I can tell.

26:53.699 --> 26:54.787
- So how'd that happen now?

26:55.657 --> 26:57.224
- I don't know.

26:57.398 --> 26:59.139
Body was pretty torn up.

26:59.313 --> 27:01.228
- How do you even know
it's a homicide then?

27:03.534 --> 27:04.361
- A hunch.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.451
- A hunch?
- Yeah.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.670
- You're crazy.

27:08.844 --> 27:09.889
You gonna hang
your hat on a hunch?

27:10.063 --> 27:10.803
- You'd be surprised.

27:10.977 --> 27:12.718
Cops do it all the time.

27:12.892 --> 27:13.806
You forget about that?

27:13.980 --> 27:15.372
- I don't forget about anything.

27:15.546 --> 27:16.547
- Look I just stopped
by here to tell you

27:16.722 --> 27:18.332
Burt Thompson's dead.

27:18.506 --> 27:20.639
Figured you oughta know,
you being the mayor and all.

27:21.727 --> 27:24.251
- What happened to us, huh?

27:24.425 --> 27:26.079
We used to be
partners, you know.

27:27.471 --> 27:29.299
The two of us, we've
seen more shit than

27:29.473 --> 27:32.259
any two humans are supposed
to see in a goddamn life time.

27:33.521 --> 27:35.349
We used to trust each
other with our lives.

27:35.523 --> 27:36.698
- Yes, sir, we did.

27:39.440 --> 27:40.659
That went right out
the window the day

27:40.833 --> 27:42.356
you started sleepin'
with my wife.

27:54.411 --> 27:55.978
- What the fuck
did you just say?

27:56.152 --> 27:56.936
- You heard me.

27:58.981 --> 28:00.287
You've been carrying
a torch for Karen

28:00.461 --> 28:01.941
since the day you met her.

28:02.115 --> 28:03.943
You know it and I know it.

28:05.118 --> 28:07.990
- Now see Ethan, shit like that.

28:08.164 --> 28:10.906
That's how I know you
lost your goddamn mind.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.603
- She started working
nights all of a sudden,

28:12.778 --> 28:14.649
comin' in early in the morning,
can't look me in the eye.

28:14.823 --> 28:16.782
I don't need to be a cop
to see what's going on.

28:16.956 --> 28:18.609
- Ethan, Ethan, Ethan--

28:18.784 --> 28:21.134
- I'd appreciate it if you
started calling me sheriff.

28:22.091 --> 28:23.266
- Yeah.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.790
- I thank you for the drink.

28:54.471 --> 28:55.472
- Do you mind?

28:55.646 --> 28:56.996
- Sure.

28:57.170 --> 28:58.127
Why the hell not?

28:59.433 --> 29:00.782
- I never got your name.

29:00.956 --> 29:01.740
- It's Lucy.

29:03.393 --> 29:05.831
- Well Lucy, I'm in your debt.

29:07.484 --> 29:08.311
- Wait.

29:09.617 --> 29:10.444
Shit.

29:12.141 --> 29:13.839
You can't go anywhere

31:37.721 --> 31:40.376
hadn't done this.

wrong bar buddy.

31:51.561 --> 31:53.346
- You don't wanna do this.

31:53.520 --> 31:54.260

from the Ming Dynasty.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.580

33:09.074 --> 33:10.510
- Go for Hardy.

33:10.684 --> 33:12.947
-  We got a 10-67
down on Old Fort Road.

33:13.121 --> 33:15.732
Requesting immediate
assistance, please respond.

33:15.906 --> 33:17.517
- What's going on Meg?

33:17.691 --> 33:18.997
-  You know how we've
been having some trouble

33:19.171 --> 33:21.129
with that biker
gang, Black Cross?

33:21.303 --> 33:22.609
- Yeah.

33:22.783 --> 33:23.610
-  I don't think
they're gonna be

33:23.784 --> 33:25.525
much trouble anymore.

33:28.180 --> 33:29.007
- Problem?

33:43.760 --> 33:44.631
- Jesus.

34:01.909 --> 34:03.302
Hey.

34:03.476 --> 34:04.129
Hey.

34:04.303 --> 34:06.000
- Hey.
- Jesus!

34:06.174 --> 34:07.001
Walter.

34:08.307 --> 34:09.917
Do not sneak up on me like that.

34:12.267 --> 34:14.965
- Eh, I never seen
nothin' like this, Ethan.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.448
Poor Joe saw the whole thing.

34:19.622 --> 34:20.406
- Joe?

34:21.798 --> 34:22.669
Joe?

34:24.584 --> 34:25.498
You all right?

34:25.672 --> 34:27.065
Tell me what happened here.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.153
Start from the beginnin'.

34:28.327 --> 34:28.979
- Well I was just comin' from--

34:29.154 --> 34:30.242
- Not you.

34:30.416 --> 34:31.199
Him.

34:33.332 --> 34:34.202
- Sheriff.

34:35.725 --> 34:38.380
Me and the boys, we was
just going out for a ride.

34:38.554 --> 34:41.035
We thought we'd stop for
just a few brain grenades.

34:43.037 --> 34:45.170
Next thing we know,
six men, they just,

34:45.344 --> 34:47.998
they just came up on
us, from nowhere.

34:50.740 --> 34:53.091
Took our clothes,
our guns, our women.

34:55.267 --> 34:58.661
This one dude, he just,
he just punched his hand

34:58.835 --> 35:02.100
right through Judge and
ripped out his heart.

35:03.710 --> 35:07.627
After that, he was all
interested in our bikes.

35:07.801 --> 35:09.933
Wanted to learn how to
ride, insisted on it.

35:11.152 --> 35:12.719
They were just screwing
around with us.

35:15.548 --> 35:19.160
I don't remember
anything after that.

35:19.334 --> 35:21.858
I just remember waking up,

35:22.032 --> 35:23.860
just seeing everybody dead.

35:24.034 --> 35:25.210
- All right.

35:25.384 --> 35:26.559
All right.

35:26.733 --> 35:28.213
We're gonna get you some help.

35:34.262 --> 35:35.785
- Did they say where
they were headin'?

35:37.396 --> 35:38.527
Drop the gun sheriff.

35:38.701 --> 35:39.615
- Not likely.

35:40.834 --> 35:42.618
- Don't make me ask again.

35:50.409 --> 35:51.497
Which way did they go?

35:52.976 --> 35:55.065
- They were lookin'
for a hide out.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.242
I told them about the
old machine factory.

35:58.852 --> 36:00.027
- You know where that is?

36:03.117 --> 36:04.597
Well let's go.

36:04.771 --> 36:06.860
- Oh no, no, no, you're
not goin' anywhere.

36:08.078 --> 36:10.255
- I hate to do this
to you, sheriff.

36:10.429 --> 36:12.300
But you got a whole lot of
trouble coming your way.

36:12.474 --> 36:14.215
- Now see, what do
you mean by that?

36:15.434 --> 36:16.174
You know what's going on here?

36:16.348 --> 36:17.653
You a part of this?

36:17.827 --> 36:19.786
- You seem like a good
man, and a good man will

36:19.960 --> 36:21.614
get that gentleman to a doc.

36:24.269 --> 36:26.140
-  Go on
Lucy, it's all right.

36:27.837 --> 36:29.099
- Don't worry.

36:29.274 --> 36:30.710
I'll see you soon.

36:30.884 --> 36:32.451
- Oh you're damn right you will.

36:36.803 --> 36:38.152
Meg, I need all my
deputies down here.

36:38.326 --> 36:39.893
I needed 'em 15 minutes ago.

36:41.155 --> 36:42.025
-  Copy that sheriff.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.897
- Walter, go get your gun.

36:44.071 --> 36:44.898
- You bet.

36:47.553 --> 36:50.599
- We are goin' huntin'.

37:00.130 --> 37:00.870
- What is it?

37:03.351 --> 37:04.613
- I'm not goin' any
further with you

37:04.787 --> 37:06.136
until I get some answers.

37:06.311 --> 37:07.486
- Now is not the time.

37:07.660 --> 37:09.314
- Come clean or I walk.

37:09.488 --> 37:10.706
- Lucy.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.360
These men are not
like other men.

37:12.534 --> 37:13.840
It's very important
that I reach them

37:14.014 --> 37:16.364
before nightfall or more
people will get killed.

37:17.670 --> 37:19.367
- You're so full of shit.

37:19.541 --> 37:22.065
- I can't explain
everything right now.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.763
But I need you to believe
me when I tell you

37:23.937 --> 37:26.461
that I don't get to that factory
before your sheriff does,

37:26.635 --> 37:28.289
he will die.

37:28.463 --> 37:29.247
Please.

37:34.164 --> 37:35.383
- All right.

37:35.557 --> 37:36.950
Come on.

37:37.124 --> 37:38.865
It's just up the way.

37:43.696 --> 37:44.958
- All right, here's
the schematics.

37:45.132 --> 37:46.133
- Is that upside-down Ethan?

37:46.307 --> 37:47.134
- Shut up Walter.

37:48.918 --> 37:50.180
Now as far as I can tell,
there are five entrances

37:50.355 --> 37:51.660
into this place.

37:51.834 --> 37:53.009
Sacks, Robertson,
you take the eastern

37:53.183 --> 37:54.837
and western entrance.

37:55.011 --> 37:56.970
Dwayne, you and
Martin take the rear.

37:57.144 --> 37:58.537
Walter, you and I are
gonna go in the front door,

37:58.711 --> 38:00.278
that's right.

38:00.452 --> 38:02.367
According to Joe, there
are six men heavily armed.

38:02.541 --> 38:05.152
You encounter one of these
fugitives, you do not engage.

38:05.326 --> 38:06.675
You call for help, are we clear?

38:06.849 --> 38:07.850
-  Yes, sir.

38:08.024 --> 38:09.025
- Saddle up.

38:26.042 --> 38:27.348
- Those are?

38:27.522 --> 38:29.219
- Oh, motorcycles.

38:29.394 --> 38:31.178
Hogs, choppers.

38:31.352 --> 38:33.572
They're like--
- Steel horses.

38:33.746 --> 38:35.574
- Now you're catchin' on.

38:39.752 --> 38:42.232
- You'd better get
back to town now.

38:42.407 --> 38:43.059
- What?

38:43.233 --> 38:44.191
Why?

38:44.365 --> 38:45.235
- I told you.

38:45.410 --> 38:47.194
These are dangerous men.

38:47.368 --> 38:48.282
- Colt, I--

38:48.456 --> 38:50.066
- This is no place for a woman.

38:50.240 --> 38:51.067
Now go home.

38:52.765 --> 38:54.593
- Did you really just say that?

38:55.811 --> 38:56.595
- Well say what?

38:58.074 --> 38:59.946
- You really are like some
kind of an old fossil,

39:00.120 --> 39:00.947
aren't you?

39:02.165 --> 39:03.036
You know what, fine, whatever.

39:03.210 --> 39:04.429
Do it yourself, I'm gone.

39:09.608 --> 39:11.436
No place for a woman?

39:11.610 --> 39:12.437
Really?

39:21.489 --> 39:23.143
- Damn that woman's
a firecracker.

39:36.765 --> 39:37.810
- Hey Ethan.
- What?

39:38.985 --> 39:41.466
- You, you aint gonna
like, let me killed

39:41.640 --> 39:42.510
or nothin', are ya?

39:44.425 --> 39:46.949
- Walter, you are startin' to
make me regret deputizing you.

39:47.123 --> 39:48.734
Look, just keep your gun up.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.998
Keep your ass clenched.

39:52.172 --> 39:55.001
Do not shoot the wrong person.

39:55.175 --> 39:56.568
- Okay.

40:16.849 --> 40:18.241
Hey.
- What?

40:18.416 --> 40:19.373
- You hear anything?

40:19.547 --> 40:21.288
- I hear you talkin', shut up.

40:24.030 --> 40:25.074
Sacks is down, repeat,

40:25.248 --> 40:28.948
Sacks is down!

40:45.617 --> 40:47.793
- Come on, go, go, go, go.

40:47.967 --> 40:49.142
- Calm down, hold.

40:49.316 --> 40:50.622
Yeah, hold on,
are you all right?

40:50.796 --> 40:52.101
What's going on?
- They're chasing us.

40:52.275 --> 40:54.408
- Okay, all right.

41:42.848 --> 41:43.588
- Dammit.

41:56.296 --> 41:57.471
Got something.

42:00.039 --> 42:01.170
Shh.

42:01.344 --> 42:04.304
Over there, over there.

42:04.478 --> 42:05.348
-  What is it?

42:05.523 --> 42:07.829
- Well hell, I don't know.

42:13.487 --> 42:15.620
- I'm sure he's fine,
let's keep movin'.

42:15.794 --> 42:17.839
- You've gotta be kidding me.

42:18.013 --> 42:20.320
- What, you got an
issue with that, rookie?

42:20.494 --> 42:22.452
- Hold your horses Chuck Norris.

42:22.627 --> 42:24.672
We gotta go find the sheriff.

42:24.846 --> 42:26.631
- Hold on, hold on.

42:26.805 --> 42:28.415
Do you hear that?

42:28.589 --> 42:32.114
- No I didn't hear anyt--

42:32.288 --> 42:34.029
Okay, I heard that.

42:39.644 --> 42:40.296
- What the?

42:40.470 --> 42:41.297
- Oh my...

42:53.005 --> 42:54.572
- This is Hardy, I
hear gunfire, over.

42:54.746 --> 42:56.486
Yeah, we got him.

42:56.661 --> 42:59.881
And man, you are not
gonna believe this shit.

43:22.208 --> 43:23.775
- All right, Mr. Colt.

43:25.298 --> 43:27.343
I need you to shed some
light on what the hell is

43:27.517 --> 43:29.345
going on in my town.

43:30.259 --> 43:31.521
You can start with these.

43:32.566 --> 43:34.089
They all washed up this mornin'.

43:35.308 --> 43:36.918
- Built these with
my bare hands.

43:38.137 --> 43:39.878
- Son, the structure
of these coffins date

43:40.052 --> 43:41.967
back to the mid-1800s.

43:43.098 --> 43:44.230
- The year was 1861.

43:45.753 --> 43:46.885
Civil War just broke.

43:48.234 --> 43:51.237
I joined the Union
Army, 21st infantry,

43:51.411 --> 43:53.282
under the command of my father,

43:53.456 --> 43:55.415
Colonel James Franklin Colt, Sr.

43:55.589 --> 43:58.200
All I ever wanted to
do was make him proud.

43:59.462 --> 44:01.116
- All boys wanna be
like their father.

44:02.335 --> 44:03.597
But this is war, Colt.

44:06.731 --> 44:07.993
- I won't be away forever.

44:11.605 --> 44:13.868
- What if I never see you again?

44:15.087 --> 44:17.742
- Well you can't
think like that.

44:19.918 --> 44:20.701
Here.

44:21.659 --> 44:22.747
I got somethin' for ya.

44:24.487 --> 44:25.750
To help pass the time.

44:26.838 --> 44:28.013
- Wha, what?

44:28.187 --> 44:29.405
What?

44:29.579 --> 44:31.973
- Lydia, I want
you to be my wife.

44:34.454 --> 44:35.150
- What?

44:35.324 --> 44:36.151
- Right now.

44:36.325 --> 44:39.198
Come on.

44:39.372 --> 44:41.200
It was during the
Battle of Bull Run.

44:42.592 --> 44:43.376
That's when they came.

44:43.550 --> 44:45.117
- That's when who came?

44:46.031 --> 44:48.033
- The lycanthrope.

44:48.207 --> 44:49.034
The howlers.

44:50.513 --> 44:53.038
Well they looked human at
first, disguised as soldiers.

44:54.300 --> 44:56.128
The leader of the pack
was a man by the name

44:56.302 --> 44:57.390
of William Price.

44:58.826 --> 45:00.523
They were able to
transform into these

45:00.698 --> 45:02.177
beastly creatures.

45:03.396 --> 45:05.180
Werewolves, as some
would call them.

45:06.921 --> 45:10.925
They took my father's life,
along with most of our garrison.

45:11.099 --> 45:13.928
I was able to escape,
and return home.

45:15.408 --> 45:17.627
It'd been two years
since I'd seen my wife.

45:19.673 --> 45:21.936
One night I went to
town for supplies.

45:22.110 --> 45:24.417
Someone from Price's
gang must've spotted me

45:25.635 --> 45:27.681
'cause when I returned
home, he and his men

45:27.855 --> 45:28.813
were waitin' for me.

45:31.163 --> 45:33.556
I'm sure you all can imagine
how it escalated from there.

45:51.705 --> 45:52.532
- Hello?

45:53.576 --> 45:55.361
Who's out there?

46:04.674 --> 46:05.719
- Lydia?

46:05.893 --> 46:07.373
- Colt.

46:09.592 --> 46:11.203
- No, no, no, no.

46:14.772 --> 46:16.338
- To pass the time.

46:18.340 --> 46:19.124
- No.

46:20.038 --> 46:20.865
No, no, no.

46:29.569 --> 46:34.226
I held my Lydia in my arms,
and then began a storm.

46:35.444 --> 46:37.664
It was unlike any storm
I'd ever seen before.

46:37.838 --> 46:40.536
Lightening was almost blinding.

46:40.710 --> 46:42.712
- We had one hell of
a storm last night.

46:42.887 --> 46:43.975
- Well damn doc.

46:44.149 --> 46:45.759
Let the man finish his story.

46:47.413 --> 46:50.459
- After the sky cleared,
a hooded man came to me

46:50.633 --> 46:51.547
from out of nowhere.

46:52.548 --> 46:53.985
He called himself the Keeper.

46:55.551 --> 46:57.640
Told me that he came
from another dimension,

46:57.815 --> 46:59.947
a place known as the Afterworld.

47:00.121 --> 47:01.731
That he lived many
lifetimes dating back

47:01.906 --> 47:03.124
to the Ming Dynasty.

47:04.343 --> 47:06.301
That he was a warrior
who had slain both man

47:06.475 --> 47:07.259
and beast alike.

47:09.565 --> 47:11.306
I know this all
sounds crazy, but...

47:14.788 --> 47:15.789
The Keeper taught me
all I needed to know

47:15.963 --> 47:16.964
about the Howlers.

47:18.444 --> 47:20.011
Where they lived, what
they ate, and most of all,

47:20.185 --> 47:21.012
how to kill 'em.

47:22.274 --> 47:24.189
The Keeper chose me
to be his hunter.

47:24.363 --> 47:26.321
-  Why do you
think he chose you?

47:26.495 --> 47:28.019
- Because I was driven by rage

47:28.193 --> 47:29.890
that no man was
ever meant to have.

47:31.805 --> 47:33.589
I slaughtered over
a hundred howlers.

47:34.939 --> 47:36.897
It became my obsession.

47:37.071 --> 47:38.203
I finally caught up
to Price and his gang

47:38.377 --> 47:39.857
a couple years after.

47:41.815 --> 47:43.643
Right here, in this very town.

47:45.340 --> 47:48.735
I put an end to the reign of
the demon wolf that night,

47:48.909 --> 47:51.303
or at least I thought I had.

47:52.695 --> 47:56.264
Buried them inside these
coffins along with the scepter.

47:56.438 --> 47:57.570
- The scepter?

47:59.528 --> 48:01.704
- The scepter was given
to me by the Keeper.

48:02.923 --> 48:04.533
It's a weapon, with
mystical powers.

48:04.707 --> 48:06.796
It's even known for
resurrecting the dead.

48:09.277 --> 48:11.062
Somehow it brought
us all back here.

48:12.498 --> 48:15.501
Maybe by some sort of global
shifting in the earth.

48:16.676 --> 48:18.504
That could explain
your big storm.

48:18.678 --> 48:21.986
All I know is, I need
to find this object

48:22.160 --> 48:23.683
because it is the only
weapon that will stop

48:23.857 --> 48:25.293
the last breathing howlers.

48:28.296 --> 48:29.689
Still don't believe me.

48:29.863 --> 48:31.343
- Yeah well if you're
asking if I believe

48:31.517 --> 48:34.520
you're a 150 year old
gunslinger and werewolf hunter,

48:35.913 --> 48:36.870
no, I don't.

48:38.785 --> 48:40.091
Where were you all the time
you were supposed to be dead?

48:40.265 --> 48:41.005
Were you in heaven?

48:41.179 --> 48:42.093
Hell?

48:42.267 --> 48:44.008
Do I look like an idiot to you?

48:45.705 --> 48:47.228
I'll tell you what I do
think, I think these are

48:47.402 --> 48:49.056
a bunch of outlaw cop
killers on the run.

48:49.230 --> 48:50.362
I think you're playin' us.

48:50.536 --> 48:51.537
That's what I think.

48:52.668 --> 48:54.105
Lock him up.

48:54.279 --> 48:56.107
I got bodies pilin' up on ice.

48:56.281 --> 48:58.370
I don't have time
for this voodoo crap.

48:58.544 --> 49:00.633
- But sheriff, we saw them.
- Ethan, just listen--

49:00.807 --> 49:02.940
- Lock him up and
take his weapons.

49:03.114 --> 49:04.898
- That's a very
bad idea, sheriff.

49:05.899 --> 49:07.422
It's a full moon tonight.

49:07.596 --> 49:09.250
Howlers will feast.

49:09.424 --> 49:12.427
- Well, hell, I guess
us ignorant folks

49:12.601 --> 49:14.821
at Temple Wells just
have to lock our doors,

49:14.995 --> 49:15.822
aint that right?

49:17.737 --> 49:18.694
Get him out of here.

49:20.218 --> 49:21.001
- Yes, sir.

49:22.089 --> 49:23.134
- Walter?

49:23.308 --> 49:24.396
You take Lucy home.

49:25.919 --> 49:28.313
I've heard enough of this
nonsense for one night.

49:29.923 --> 49:31.359
- Where you goin', Ethan?

49:34.928 --> 49:37.365
- Well I'm gonna
put out an APB, doc.

49:39.106 --> 49:40.760
On werewolves, apparently.

49:47.071 --> 49:49.682
- He's havin', uh,
woman troubles.

49:52.902 --> 49:54.774
- Come on, you wanna
get some coffee goin'?

49:54.948 --> 49:56.167
Looks like we're gonna
be in for one heck

49:56.341 --> 49:57.298
of a long night.

49:58.604 --> 49:59.431
Right this way.

50:06.133 --> 50:07.787
Yeah, it used to
be a bank vault.

50:10.268 --> 50:12.226
Hey uh, listen.

50:14.576 --> 50:16.143
My partner and I really
appreciate what you

50:16.317 --> 50:19.973
did for us back there and, well,
I just wanna let you know

50:20.147 --> 50:21.018
if there's anything we can
do while you're in here,

50:21.192 --> 50:22.802
then just let me know, okay?

50:25.544 --> 50:26.327
-  Deputy?

50:28.286 --> 50:30.679
- No, Lucy cannot be here.

50:30.853 --> 50:32.725
The sheriff told you
to take her home, Walt.

50:32.899 --> 50:35.510
- Well I tried, but, well
she just wouldn't have it.

50:35.684 --> 50:37.773
- I've spent enough nights
alone out in the middle

50:37.947 --> 50:39.297
of nowhere, and I
don't intend to do it

50:39.471 --> 50:40.994
with monsters runnin' around.

50:41.951 --> 50:43.257
- For crying out loud, Walt.

50:57.967 --> 50:58.751
- Ethan?

50:59.795 --> 51:00.622
- Hi, dad.

51:03.625 --> 51:05.149
- Hey sweetheart, I'm sorry.

51:07.151 --> 51:09.066
It's wonderful to have you home.

51:09.240 --> 51:10.676
- You look stressed.

51:12.417 --> 51:14.984
- I'm sure I do, it's
been a hell of a day.

51:15.159 --> 51:16.682
- What's going on?

51:16.856 --> 51:18.162
- A little trouble downtown.

51:18.336 --> 51:21.034
Sacks and Robertson are dead.

51:21.208 --> 51:23.080
- Oh my god, Ethan,
what happened?

51:24.168 --> 51:25.560
- We're after some fugitives,

51:27.040 --> 51:29.695
and I found Burt Thompson dead
by the river this morning.

51:30.957 --> 51:31.784
- And you're just
now telling me this?

51:31.958 --> 51:33.699
Why didn't you call me?

51:33.873 --> 51:35.179
- Sweetheart, why don't you
go upstairs and freshen up?

51:35.353 --> 51:36.963
I'll take you out for a beer.

51:40.053 --> 51:40.706
Go on.

51:40.880 --> 51:42.186
- Dad.

51:42.360 --> 51:43.883
Are you like in
shock or something?

51:44.057 --> 51:47.016
You never let me drink
alcohol in front of you.

51:47.191 --> 51:48.409
- Yeah well a lot of
things are gonna change

51:48.583 --> 51:49.367
in this family.

51:54.720 --> 51:56.591
A lot of things already
have, isn't that right, babe?

51:56.765 --> 51:58.115
- What are you talkin' about?

52:02.293 --> 52:03.685
- I'm gonna take a shower.

52:06.732 --> 52:08.690
- No, I'm not gonna do that.

52:08.864 --> 52:13.086
Look Lucy, let me make myself
crystal clear with you.

52:13.260 --> 52:16.394
I saw whatever that
thing was at the mill

52:16.568 --> 52:19.658
return to human form
after it went down.

52:19.832 --> 52:21.660
Now, until the committee
decides on what

52:21.834 --> 52:23.357
we're gonna do about
this situation,

52:23.531 --> 52:24.837
I'm gonna do as I'm told.

52:25.011 --> 52:26.926
- The situation?

52:27.100 --> 52:29.581
Would you get your
head out of your ass?

52:29.755 --> 52:32.975
Nine people are dead, two
of them are your friends.

52:33.150 --> 52:34.238
- That's enough!

52:34.412 --> 52:35.369
Both of ya.

52:35.543 --> 52:37.502
You're acting like children.

52:37.676 --> 52:38.851
- All right guys, I
think it's time for us

52:39.025 --> 52:40.069
to get out of here.

52:40.244 --> 52:41.593
- Yeah, that's a great idea.

52:45.118 --> 52:46.511
And Walter, I think you
should go home as well.

52:46.685 --> 52:49.296
- Well if it's all the
same, I just as soon

52:49.470 --> 52:51.255
stay here for a while.

52:51.429 --> 52:53.170
- Walter, not you too.

52:55.607 --> 52:56.956
All right then.

52:57.130 --> 52:58.436
All right look, I
gotta go take a leak.

52:58.610 --> 53:00.177
Keep on eye on him, all right?
- Okay.

53:02.657 --> 53:03.919
- You're startin' to
believe that what I'm

53:04.093 --> 53:05.573
telling you is true,
aren't you Walter?

53:07.096 --> 53:07.967
- Maybe.

53:09.316 --> 53:13.102
Let's uh, let's say
there are werewolves.

53:14.060 --> 53:15.670
You know how to stop 'em right?

53:15.844 --> 53:17.324
- For now.

53:17.498 --> 53:19.283
- Well what's that
supposed to mean, son?

53:19.457 --> 53:20.458
- It's a new time.

53:21.720 --> 53:23.678
They'll evolve,
they'll multiply,

53:23.852 --> 53:25.637
they'll cast their
curse upon others.

53:26.986 --> 53:28.988
It's gonna be harder
and harder to stop 'em

53:29.162 --> 53:31.469
until one day, sooner
rather than later,

53:32.687 --> 53:34.254
the world'll be
covered in darkness.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.306
- You're just joshin' me.

53:44.525 --> 53:45.439
Aren't ya?

53:53.795 --> 53:54.970
- Get me out of here!

53:55.144 --> 53:56.581
- God.

54:03.152 --> 54:06.243
- Your God cannot save you now.

54:06.417 --> 54:08.549
Look at what he did to me.

54:09.507 --> 54:10.899
- Dammit.

54:14.251 --> 54:16.557
- Hey, wolf man!

54:24.522 --> 54:25.914
- You bitch.

54:30.267 --> 54:31.616
- Lucy.

54:31.790 --> 54:32.747
Get the key.

54:39.885 --> 54:41.103
Hey!

54:46.805 --> 54:47.719
- Are you okay?

54:47.893 --> 54:48.894
Are you okay?

55:08.653 --> 55:10.132
- Why is he out of his cell?

55:12.961 --> 55:13.788
Dammit.

55:23.755 --> 55:25.017
Terry, are you all right?

55:26.410 --> 55:27.236
- I'm fine.

55:28.673 --> 55:29.630
It's just a scratch.

55:29.804 --> 55:30.805
He didn't bite me.

55:31.806 --> 55:32.851
- You sure about that?

55:34.374 --> 55:35.767
- I'm sure.

55:35.941 --> 55:37.203
- I think it's safe
to say desperate times

55:37.377 --> 55:39.379
call for desperate measures.

55:39.553 --> 55:40.815
We've been friends a
long time and you're the

55:40.989 --> 55:43.035
sheriff of this town,
so whatever you decide,

55:43.209 --> 55:45.080
I will support you.
- All right, doc.

55:46.647 --> 55:48.257
How do we stop these things?

55:48.432 --> 55:50.434
- To stop 'em, you
need to understand 'em.

55:50.608 --> 55:53.306
- All right, make me understand.

55:53.480 --> 55:55.656
- Ancient legends say
the werewolf will only

55:55.830 --> 55:57.441
prowl at night
under a full moon.

55:58.616 --> 55:59.312
Is that true?

55:59.486 --> 56:00.313
- Are you done?

56:01.270 --> 56:02.097
- What?

56:03.229 --> 56:04.709
I grew up on monster movies.

56:05.797 --> 56:07.189
- Go ahead.

56:07.364 --> 56:09.366
- A full moon gives
'em miraculous powers.

56:09.540 --> 56:12.717
But a howler can attack at
any time during the day.

56:12.891 --> 56:14.196
Price knows I'm here.

56:14.371 --> 56:15.459
He's gonna come for me.

56:18.113 --> 56:21.682
We need weapons, and
a place to dig in.

56:21.856 --> 56:24.119
Somewhere where we
can see what's comin'.

56:24.293 --> 56:25.164
- I know a place.

56:27.558 --> 56:29.734
- You mean that house
you just remodeled?

56:29.908 --> 56:32.650
Oh yeah, Karen's gonna be
completely okay with that.

56:32.824 --> 56:35.653
- No, no, I'm not
talking about my house.

56:35.827 --> 56:37.350
I'm talking about the mayor's.

56:38.612 --> 56:39.396
Anything else?

56:40.788 --> 56:42.181
- Yes.

56:42.355 --> 56:43.965
I need to learn how
to ride a truck.

56:45.010 --> 56:45.837
- Drive a truck.

56:47.186 --> 56:48.796
You wanna learn
to drive a truck.

56:50.581 --> 56:51.669
- Oh god, help us.

57:07.859 --> 57:08.642
- Ethan?

57:11.602 --> 57:12.385
Ethan.
- What?

57:12.559 --> 57:13.821
- What are you doing?

57:13.995 --> 57:16.128
- Get Emily, get
dressed, we're leavin'.

57:16.302 --> 57:17.216
- She's asleep.

57:17.390 --> 57:18.652
- Well wake her up, Karen.

57:20.828 --> 57:22.787
- Ethan, just tell
me what's going on.

57:22.961 --> 57:23.744
- Dammit!

57:33.275 --> 57:35.408
How long, Karen?

57:36.322 --> 57:37.932
It's killing me inside.

57:38.106 --> 57:40.631
Of all the people you
could've picked, Bob Barlow?

57:42.067 --> 57:45.244
You know what that son
of bitch did to me?

57:47.115 --> 57:49.378
- A year, almost.

57:52.207 --> 57:53.078
- Jesus.

57:57.952 --> 58:00.389
- You and I, we were
fighting a lot and

58:01.956 --> 58:05.351
we were both just
working all the time.

58:05.525 --> 58:09.616
And Emily, she was, she
was off just fighting

58:09.790 --> 58:11.226
her own life and...

58:16.928 --> 58:18.103
Ethan, I never meant--
- No.

58:18.277 --> 58:19.496
You don't get to say that.

58:24.326 --> 58:25.850
I don't know why
people say that,

58:26.024 --> 58:27.460
"I never meant to hurt you."

58:28.635 --> 58:29.331
You've been banging
the mayor of the town

58:29.506 --> 58:30.376
like a screen door.

58:33.379 --> 58:35.555
How do you think that's
gonna make me feel?

58:35.729 --> 58:36.948
- Is that true?

58:40.473 --> 58:43.911
- You weren't supposed
to hear that, baby.

58:48.612 --> 58:49.526
- Mom.

58:51.571 --> 58:53.138
So that explains a thing or two.

58:55.706 --> 58:57.272
- I'm sorry Em. I really
messed things up.

58:57.446 --> 58:58.535
- Yeah, you sure did.

59:06.194 --> 59:09.807
- Now this, is a
good lookin' truck.

59:09.981 --> 59:11.635
- This is a car.

59:11.809 --> 59:14.551
It belonged to Deputy Grant
and if you can drive this,

59:14.725 --> 59:16.378
you can drive just
about anything.

59:17.466 --> 59:18.511
Let's give it a try.

59:28.695 --> 59:30.741
Brakes, hit the brakes!

59:32.656 --> 59:34.092
This is gonna take some work.

59:38.531 --> 59:41.447
This is a classic, so you
gotta treat it real gentle.

59:49.107 --> 59:50.978
♪ With all I get ♪

59:51.152 --> 59:54.939
♪ 100,000 miles and she
aint seen nothin' yet ♪

59:55.113 --> 1:00:00.031
♪ I drove 100,000 mile and
she aint seen nothin' yet ♪

1:00:01.510 --> 1:00:03.338
Not bad, tiger.

1:00:03.512 --> 1:00:04.731
Not bad at all.

1:00:11.608 --> 1:00:13.479
- Hey sheriff, what's
this curfew all about?

1:00:13.653 --> 1:00:15.524
- Well, you hear what
happened to Burt Thompson?

1:00:15.699 --> 1:00:16.917
- Yeah.

1:00:17.091 --> 1:00:18.223
- That's what the
curfew's about.

1:00:21.313 --> 1:00:22.531
- Well this is it.

1:00:22.706 --> 1:00:23.881
This is all we have.

1:00:25.056 --> 1:00:26.100
- We'll make it work.

1:00:37.329 --> 1:00:38.243
-  Excuse me.

1:00:41.115 --> 1:00:42.247
- God.

1:00:42.421 --> 1:00:43.814
Honey, are you all right?

1:00:43.988 --> 1:00:44.902
- Let me get you somethin'.

1:00:45.076 --> 1:00:46.468
- No, I'm okay.

1:00:49.863 --> 1:00:52.387
It must just be a
stomach bug or something.

1:00:52.561 --> 1:00:53.388
Um...

1:00:55.652 --> 1:00:56.565
Come on, let's get going.

1:00:56.740 --> 1:00:57.871
We've gotta get to the sheriff.

1:01:00.221 --> 1:01:01.048
- What?

1:01:01.222 --> 1:01:02.006
What is it?

1:01:03.398 --> 1:01:04.138
- Nothin'.

1:01:04.312 --> 1:01:05.139
Let's go.

1:01:09.753 --> 1:01:10.579
I'll drive.

1:01:27.814 --> 1:01:29.381
- Ethan, why don't
I just leave town?

1:01:29.555 --> 1:01:31.600
I can take Emily and--
- Emily's with Lucy.

1:01:31.775 --> 1:01:32.601
She's fine.

1:01:33.646 --> 1:01:34.908
I wanna get this over with.

1:01:37.476 --> 1:01:40.697
Wait a minute, just wait.

1:01:44.831 --> 1:01:46.398
I need you to help
me understand.

1:01:48.835 --> 1:01:50.794
I get kicked off the force
in Dallas, you say if

1:01:50.968 --> 1:01:54.275
we move here, that it'll
be a blessing in disguise.

1:01:54.449 --> 1:01:55.799
Remember that?

1:01:55.973 --> 1:01:58.715
You say you want a simple life.

1:01:58.889 --> 1:02:00.194
- I did.

1:02:00.368 --> 1:02:02.327
- You told me you wanted
to grow old together.

1:02:02.501 --> 1:02:03.284
- I did.

1:02:04.546 --> 1:02:06.723
- Okay well then,
I don't understand.

1:02:11.815 --> 1:02:12.641
- I don't know.

1:02:18.082 --> 1:02:19.692
You were never around,
Ethan, you were married

1:02:19.866 --> 1:02:22.347
to your job then
and I was lonely and

1:02:23.522 --> 1:02:24.871
we moved here,
nothing got better.

1:02:31.878 --> 1:02:33.880
We're never gonna get
past this, are we?

1:02:36.317 --> 1:02:37.797
You're never gonna forgive me.

1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:41.453
- It's just with me, there's
some lines you don't cross.

1:02:44.761 --> 1:02:46.937
- If it's any consolation--
- It's not.

1:03:03.910 --> 1:03:05.651
- Mrs. Hardy.

1:03:05.825 --> 1:03:07.958
- You can cut the Miss Hardy
crap, I need to see your boss.

1:03:08.915 --> 1:03:10.787
- Nobody walks past me.

1:03:10.961 --> 1:03:12.223
- Where is he?

1:03:15.530 --> 1:03:16.836
I'll find him.

1:03:17.010 --> 1:03:18.098
- You should've have moved.

1:03:28.674 --> 1:03:31.329
- Is this a bad time, Bob?

1:03:31.503 --> 1:03:32.460
- Well, shit.

1:03:32.634 --> 1:03:34.027
- Yeah.

1:03:34.201 --> 1:03:37.552
- I wish you'd have let
me know you was comin'.

1:03:39.859 --> 1:03:41.295
You all right there, Princess?

1:03:43.123 --> 1:03:44.690
- Remind me again, Bob,
how many years you get

1:03:44.864 --> 1:03:46.431
for illegal gun smuggling?

1:03:46.605 --> 1:03:47.432
It's a bunch, isn't it?

1:03:47.606 --> 1:03:48.999
- Yeah.

1:03:49.173 --> 1:03:49.869
- If I was you boys,
I'd clear out before

1:03:50.043 --> 1:03:51.175
I change my mind.

1:03:53.830 --> 1:03:54.656
You deaf?

1:03:56.615 --> 1:03:57.834
- Why don't you boys take a run?

1:04:00.837 --> 1:04:01.707
Well.

1:04:01.881 --> 1:04:03.056
Ethan, Ethan, Ethan.

1:04:04.971 --> 1:04:08.366
Look, I know you've had a
rough go of it as of late,

1:04:08.540 --> 1:04:10.716
you know, why don't we,
why don't we just to take

1:04:10.890 --> 1:04:13.023
it down a notch, shall we?

1:04:16.635 --> 1:04:19.116
- Bob, you are
sleeping with my wife.

1:04:20.769 --> 1:04:24.643
Using this town as a port
to sell automatic weapons

1:04:24.817 --> 1:04:27.341
and you're asking me to
take 'er down a notch, huh?

1:04:28.560 --> 1:04:30.997
You know the funny thing
is, I've always known.

1:04:31.171 --> 1:04:33.608
Always known all
about it, everything.

1:04:34.696 --> 1:04:36.481
I guess I just
didn't wanna face it.

1:04:37.482 --> 1:04:38.483
I still don't, really.

1:04:39.658 --> 1:04:41.486
- Sugar, hand me a glass.

1:04:43.183 --> 1:04:46.665
You know, I mean, you bust
in here, no search warrant.

1:04:48.362 --> 1:04:50.451
I mean this whole
infidelity crap.

1:04:50.625 --> 1:04:51.931
I mean you really think that's
appropriate to talk about

1:04:52.105 --> 1:04:53.977
in front of your wife?
- Go to hell, Bob.

1:04:54.151 --> 1:04:55.674
- Now you see that?

1:04:55.848 --> 1:04:58.198
You see that kind of
passion right there?

1:04:58.372 --> 1:05:00.331
Let me tell you about
that passion here.

1:05:01.985 --> 1:05:04.857
Because that anger,
and that passion,

1:05:05.031 --> 1:05:07.425
that's never directed a
man that's slept with her.

1:05:08.948 --> 1:05:11.342
Now that kind of anger,
that's only ever directed

1:05:11.516 --> 1:05:13.170
at man that's fucked her.

1:05:14.258 --> 1:05:15.824
Maybe that's your problem.

1:05:15.999 --> 1:05:17.609
Maybe you never
fucked your wife.

1:05:18.784 --> 1:05:22.353
'Cause you don't have
any balls, do ya?

1:05:22.527 --> 1:05:23.963
You never had any.

1:05:25.486 --> 1:05:26.400
But you know what?

1:05:26.574 --> 1:05:28.315
Let's put all that aside,

1:05:29.882 --> 1:05:31.318
and why don't you tell me
why the hell you're here.

1:05:33.538 --> 1:05:35.409
- Yeah, all right
Bob.

1:05:37.020 --> 1:05:37.846
Here's the deal.

1:05:39.500 --> 1:05:41.024
As much as I'd love
to bust your ass

1:05:41.198 --> 1:05:42.460
and put you behind bars,

1:05:43.896 --> 1:05:45.680
I can't believe I'm gonna
say this but I think

1:05:45.854 --> 1:05:47.334
the best thing for
both of us right now is

1:05:47.508 --> 1:05:48.683
to combine forces.

1:05:51.382 --> 1:05:53.906
- You wanna run
that by me again?

1:05:54.080 --> 1:05:54.907
You uh,

1:05:56.082 --> 1:05:56.909
you want in?

1:05:58.389 --> 1:05:59.781
- No, no, nothin' like that.

1:06:01.609 --> 1:06:03.263
I'm saying it's your lucky day.

1:06:03.437 --> 1:06:05.222
I'm gonna turn a blind eye
to all this illegal activity

1:06:05.396 --> 1:06:06.527
in your house.

1:06:06.701 --> 1:06:07.833
We got bigger problems.

1:06:09.269 --> 1:06:10.749
Much bigger problems.

1:06:10.923 --> 1:06:12.098
- Is that right?

1:06:13.273 --> 1:06:14.796
Why don't you give me a
pinch in there, sugar?

1:06:14.971 --> 1:06:16.059
All right, you know what?

1:06:16.233 --> 1:06:17.016
Ethan, I'll bite.

1:06:18.322 --> 1:06:19.976
What kind of
problems do we have?

1:06:20.150 --> 1:06:23.892
- Well the last 24 hours,
a good portion of our town

1:06:24.067 --> 1:06:25.938
has been killed by
a pack of predators.

1:06:27.113 --> 1:06:28.941
When I say predators,
I mean werewolves.

1:06:32.771 --> 1:06:35.426
- Werewolves huh?
- Yeah.

1:06:35.600 --> 1:06:37.515
Yep, that's right.

1:06:37.689 --> 1:06:38.472
Werewolves.

1:06:39.952 --> 1:06:42.433
Best I understand it, they've
been extinct for 150 years

1:06:42.607 --> 1:06:44.261
but they've returned.

1:06:44.435 --> 1:06:46.089
Decided to feast
on our little town.

1:06:46.263 --> 1:06:48.526
- Oh shit.

1:06:48.700 --> 1:06:49.962
What is this?

1:06:50.136 --> 1:06:50.963
Be honest.

1:06:52.617 --> 1:06:53.792
- I need your help, Bob.

1:06:54.967 --> 1:06:56.925
The town needs your help.

1:06:58.666 --> 1:07:00.277
These creatures
are out for blood.

1:07:01.452 --> 1:07:03.236
This little sanctuary
you've got here,

1:07:04.672 --> 1:07:07.066
might be the only way we
all live through the night.

1:07:07.240 --> 1:07:08.285
And that's it.

1:07:08.459 --> 1:07:09.634
That's what I'm askin'.

1:07:12.463 --> 1:07:13.507
- I see, this is good.

1:07:14.943 --> 1:07:16.858
This is good right here.

1:07:17.033 --> 1:07:19.905
'Cause I'm glad we've
arrived at this point.

1:07:21.124 --> 1:07:24.649
'Cause after all these
years, Jesus Christ,

1:07:24.823 --> 1:07:26.433
you've finally lost
it, haven't you?

1:07:26.607 --> 1:07:27.956
You see I thought you
were gonna come here,

1:07:28.131 --> 1:07:29.741
and we're gonna settle
this like gentlemen.

1:07:29.915 --> 1:07:31.264
But apparently I was wrong.

1:07:32.700 --> 1:07:35.486
Now sugar, I don't know
what kinda game your trigger

1:07:35.660 --> 1:07:37.096
happy husband's here to play,

1:07:38.315 --> 1:07:40.273
but I assure you that
shit ends right now.

1:07:41.144 --> 1:07:42.101
Tinkerbell.

1:07:43.233 --> 1:07:44.451
Why don't you do
your job for a change

1:07:44.625 --> 1:07:46.323
and see the Hardys
to the front door.

1:07:46.497 --> 1:07:47.933
- Unless you want
my foot up your ass,

1:07:48.107 --> 1:07:49.413
you best steer clear of me.

1:07:52.546 --> 1:07:53.721
People are dead, Bob.

1:07:55.375 --> 1:07:56.202
Dead.

1:07:57.508 --> 1:07:59.858
I lost three of my
deputies, and Walter.

1:08:01.164 --> 1:08:02.165
Walter was my friend.

1:08:05.733 --> 1:08:06.517
I'm not jokin'.

1:08:07.779 --> 1:08:08.606
- You need to
listen to him, Bob.

1:08:08.780 --> 1:08:09.868
He's tellin' the truth.

1:08:12.044 --> 1:08:14.002
- See I like the tone change.

1:08:14.177 --> 1:08:15.569
I like the tone change a lot.

1:08:18.398 --> 1:08:21.097
I think I'll entertain your
little delusions for a bit.

1:08:22.881 --> 1:08:24.578
But if I find you got ulteriors,

1:08:26.276 --> 1:08:29.627
it's not gonna end well for
either one of ya, I assure ya.

1:08:29.801 --> 1:08:30.845
Are we clear?

1:08:32.412 --> 1:08:33.587
- Yeah.

1:08:33.761 --> 1:08:34.588
Okay, Bob.

1:08:35.894 --> 1:08:36.808
Fair enough.

1:08:39.463 --> 1:08:44.424
- Fuckin' werewolves.

1:08:49.081 --> 1:08:52.215
It has come to my
attention that a series

1:08:52.389 --> 1:08:54.739
of murders has taken place
here in Temple Wells.

1:08:56.132 --> 1:08:58.090
That good sheriff has informed
me that the culprits are

1:08:58.264 --> 1:09:01.398
in fact some sort of
werewolf type creature.

1:09:01.572 --> 1:09:03.443
I'm not sure I believe
that crap, but,

1:09:04.705 --> 1:09:06.403
the town curfew stays
in effect nonetheless.

1:09:06.577 --> 1:09:09.319
- All the weapons we have are
loaded or laced with silver,

1:09:09.493 --> 1:09:11.364
the one and only way
to kill a howler.

1:09:11.538 --> 1:09:13.627
One in the heart,
or one in the head

1:09:13.801 --> 1:09:15.586
usually does the trick.

1:09:15.760 --> 1:09:17.283
Regular ammunition
will slow 'em down,

1:09:17.457 --> 1:09:19.720
but it'll mostly just
make 'em mad as a hornet.

1:09:20.678 --> 1:09:21.635
Any questions?

1:09:21.809 --> 1:09:23.289
- A few.

1:09:23.463 --> 1:09:24.986
Firstly, who the hell
are ya, and what are you

1:09:25.161 --> 1:09:26.249
doing interrupting me?

1:09:27.163 --> 1:09:28.425
- The name's Colt.

1:09:28.599 --> 1:09:30.557
- Now see Colt, I'm
the mayor of this town,

1:09:30.731 --> 1:09:31.602
you're a guest.

1:09:32.777 --> 1:09:35.083
So why don't you let
me finish talkin' huh?

1:09:35.258 --> 1:09:36.694
- Apologies, Mr. Mayor.

1:09:36.868 --> 1:09:38.522
It's just we aint got much time.

1:09:38.696 --> 1:09:40.001
- Now what the hell
makes you an expert

1:09:40.176 --> 1:09:41.960
on this situation anyway?

1:09:42.134 --> 1:09:43.004
- I've hunted these beasts, sir.

1:09:43.179 --> 1:09:44.919
I know how to defeat 'em.

1:09:47.270 --> 1:09:48.488
- You a drifter, aint ya?

1:09:51.099 --> 1:09:52.579
I've seen your kind before.

1:09:52.753 --> 1:09:54.842
- I'm no drifter, and
I can assure you you've

1:09:55.016 --> 1:09:56.279
never seen my kind before.

1:10:00.108 --> 1:10:00.761
- What do you got sugar?

1:10:00.935 --> 1:10:02.720
- Uh, Mr. Mayor.

1:10:02.894 --> 1:10:05.288
Not that we don't believe
that werewolves are

1:10:05.462 --> 1:10:08.421
coming to get us,
but the thing is...

1:10:08.595 --> 1:10:11.816
- Our boss would be really
pissed off if we're late again.

1:10:11.990 --> 1:10:13.818
We work at the Pussy Palace.

1:10:16.603 --> 1:10:17.474
- Really, Bob?

1:10:20.520 --> 1:10:21.434
- I'll take 'em.

1:10:21.608 --> 1:10:22.261
- No, no, no.

1:10:22.435 --> 1:10:23.654
No.

1:10:23.828 --> 1:10:25.264
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1:10:25.438 --> 1:10:27.658
- We don't need to put
anyone else in danger.

1:10:27.832 --> 1:10:29.616
- You come right back, you hear?

1:10:29.790 --> 1:10:31.183
- All right ladies, let's go.

1:10:42.020 --> 1:10:42.847
- Ethan.

1:10:46.198 --> 1:10:47.765
I think it's time you and I
had a little conversation.

1:10:47.939 --> 1:10:50.202
- Sure, sure, let's talk Bob.

1:10:50.376 --> 1:10:52.335
Let's start by
talkin' about Dallas.

1:10:52.509 --> 1:10:54.598
- Jesus Christ, Ethan.

1:10:54.772 --> 1:10:55.729
When are you gonna
drop that shit?

1:10:55.903 --> 1:10:56.948
- I aint gonna drop that shit.

1:10:57.122 --> 1:10:58.428
You set me up.

1:10:58.602 --> 1:11:00.212
The drugs, the guns,
they were yours.

1:11:00.386 --> 1:11:01.779
I took the fall.
- What happened is--

1:11:01.953 --> 1:11:02.693
- You let me.
- I got you out of that crap.

1:11:02.867 --> 1:11:04.216
- You got me out of it?

1:11:04.390 --> 1:11:05.304
You told people I
lost my fuckin' mind.

1:11:05.478 --> 1:11:06.958
- It worked.
- For you.

1:11:07.132 --> 1:11:08.699
For you, it worked.

1:11:10.701 --> 1:11:12.180
- Is that what this
is about, Ethan?

1:11:12.355 --> 1:11:14.226
Is it about revenge?

1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:16.968
Big old scary monsters
roaming around Temple Wells?

1:11:17.142 --> 1:11:18.709
- What's the matter?

1:11:18.883 --> 1:11:21.015
You starting to get
a little paranoid?

1:11:21.189 --> 1:11:23.235
Are you worried I might
be tellin' the truth?

1:11:24.758 --> 1:11:26.325
- I could kick out each and
every one of ya right now

1:11:26.499 --> 1:11:28.893
and I could strip your
ass of that badge.

1:11:29.067 --> 1:11:31.112
- Yeah, yeah you could.

1:11:31.287 --> 1:11:33.158
And I'd burn this
whole little dynasty

1:11:33.332 --> 1:11:34.507
you got to the ground.

1:11:36.117 --> 1:11:36.944
Try me.

1:11:37.858 --> 1:11:38.685
- Well.

1:11:40.165 --> 1:11:41.427
I honestly never thought
I'd see the day when

1:11:41.601 --> 1:11:42.907
you'd threaten me, Ethan.

1:11:43.081 --> 1:11:44.300
- What's the matter, brother?

1:11:45.213 --> 1:11:46.171
You feelin' betrayed?

1:11:48.086 --> 1:11:49.653
It stings like a
bitch, don't it?

1:11:51.176 --> 1:11:53.439
That's the damnedest
thing about betrayal, Bob.

1:11:54.701 --> 1:11:56.268
Never comes from your enemies.

1:12:11.022 --> 1:12:11.892
- What the?

1:12:29.301 --> 1:12:30.607
-  Coffee?

1:12:41.095 --> 1:12:41.879
- Wow.

1:12:43.097 --> 1:12:43.837
This is the best
damn coffee I've had

1:12:44.011 --> 1:12:45.186
in over a hundred years.

1:12:46.449 --> 1:12:49.060
- Well, I wish I could
take the credit, but,

1:12:49.234 --> 1:12:51.845
we do have machines
that make it for us now.

1:12:52.019 --> 1:12:52.890
- Of course you do.

1:12:56.197 --> 1:12:57.982
Seems like those
stars are the only things

1:12:58.156 --> 1:12:59.984
that haven't changed
in all this time.

1:13:00.941 --> 1:13:01.812
- Yeah.

1:13:04.336 --> 1:13:06.947
- I have a question I've
been meaning to ask ya.

1:13:07.121 --> 1:13:08.645
- Shoot.

1:13:08.819 --> 1:13:11.561
I mean well not
literally.

1:13:11.735 --> 1:13:13.345
- I know what you mean.

1:13:14.259 --> 1:13:16.304
What I wanted to ask you was,

1:13:16.479 --> 1:13:19.264
these clothes, you said they
belonged to your husband.

1:13:22.093 --> 1:13:23.137
- He was a Marine.

1:13:24.400 --> 1:13:26.489
A soldier, he was
killed in a war.

1:13:27.707 --> 1:13:31.102
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean--
- It's okay.

1:13:31.276 --> 1:13:34.192
I'm just still coming
to terms with it.

1:13:36.368 --> 1:13:38.196
His name was Ray.

1:13:38.370 --> 1:13:42.330
He was very sweet, and, uh,

1:13:43.331 --> 1:13:45.029
very easy on the eyes.

1:13:46.422 --> 1:13:48.206
We had a lot of fun together.

1:13:49.555 --> 1:13:50.426
I miss that.

1:13:52.732 --> 1:13:57.694
I just, I guess I just
couldn't bring myself to leave

1:13:59.435 --> 1:14:01.567
Temple Wells after
he was gone, so.

1:14:05.658 --> 1:14:07.704
I guess my life really
isn't that special.

1:14:08.705 --> 1:14:10.097
- I respectfully disagree.

1:14:14.537 --> 1:14:15.973
- Ray loved that gun.

1:14:17.670 --> 1:14:18.584
- Well you can have
it back, I just--

1:14:18.758 --> 1:14:20.064
- No, it's okay.

1:14:21.065 --> 1:14:22.196
I want you to have it.

1:14:23.850 --> 1:14:25.373
It belonged to a warrior,
and now it belongs

1:14:25.548 --> 1:14:27.201
to another one.

1:14:28.420 --> 1:14:31.118
When I found you, there
was something about you

1:14:31.292 --> 1:14:34.774
that reminded me of
him a little and,

1:14:34.948 --> 1:14:36.559
I just knew that
I had to help you.

1:14:40.650 --> 1:14:42.652
- What the hell am I lookin' at?

1:14:42.826 --> 1:14:44.784
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:14:44.958 --> 1:14:47.570
You were gone for over an
hour, where have you been?

1:14:47.744 --> 1:14:48.571
- Oh.

1:14:49.746 --> 1:14:50.703
- What happened?

1:14:50.877 --> 1:14:51.661
You were gonna take them back.

1:14:51.835 --> 1:14:53.532
- Something happened.

1:14:53.706 --> 1:14:54.359
- What?

1:14:54.533 --> 1:14:55.229
- This.

1:14:56.622 --> 1:14:57.536
- Oh, shit.

1:15:04.891 --> 1:15:05.762
- Bob!

1:15:05.936 --> 1:15:06.719
Shoot her!

1:15:09.592 --> 1:15:10.244
- Yeah!

1:15:10.418 --> 1:15:11.245
You bitch.

1:15:12.377 --> 1:15:13.683
- Shoot her Bob.

1:15:15.075 --> 1:15:16.207
- I'm sorry Ethan.

1:15:16.381 --> 1:15:18.339
You wanted it this way buddy.

1:15:18.514 --> 1:15:19.297
Oh!

1:15:20.559 --> 1:15:21.386
God!

1:15:37.837 --> 1:15:38.490
- Well hello there.

1:15:47.630 --> 1:15:48.805
- Ethan.
- Dad?

1:15:48.979 --> 1:15:49.893
- Good God.

1:15:51.024 --> 1:15:52.983
Dear Lord in heaven, Ethan.

1:15:53.157 --> 1:15:54.767
-  Doc.

1:15:54.941 --> 1:15:57.378
- Okay, um, Emily, I need
you to go get some towels,

1:15:57.553 --> 1:15:58.989
some boiling water, and a knife.

1:15:59.163 --> 1:16:01.295
And check the bathroom
for antiseptic.

1:16:01.469 --> 1:16:02.296
Go, go, go.

1:16:05.169 --> 1:16:06.126
Shh, shh.
- No, I'm all right.

1:16:06.300 --> 1:16:07.693
- Ethan, be still.

1:16:07.867 --> 1:16:09.477
- I'll be all right.

1:16:09.652 --> 1:16:11.131
- No he won't.

1:16:11.305 --> 1:16:12.611
- We can handle this son.

1:16:12.785 --> 1:16:15.396
- He's got the blood of
a wolf inside him now.

1:16:15.571 --> 1:16:17.268
Just a matter of
time before he turns.

1:16:17.442 --> 1:16:19.052
- No, I don't believe that.

1:16:19.226 --> 1:16:23.056
- It could take
minutes, hours, or days.

1:16:23.230 --> 1:16:25.537
Without the healing
powers of the scepter,

1:16:27.147 --> 1:16:29.715
it's bound to happen.

1:16:29.889 --> 1:16:30.673
- Colt.

1:16:38.071 --> 1:16:39.116
What is that?

1:17:14.455 --> 1:17:16.240
- Let's get him downstairs.

1:17:16.414 --> 1:17:17.763
- What are you gonna do?

1:17:17.937 --> 1:17:18.546
- Don't worry about
me just you guys go.

1:17:18.721 --> 1:17:20.113
Go ahead.

1:17:20.287 --> 1:17:21.462
- Come on baby.
- Come on.

1:17:21.637 --> 1:17:22.550
Come on.

1:17:22.725 --> 1:17:24.509
- Emily.

1:17:24.683 --> 1:17:25.858
Emily.
- Dad, don't talk.

1:17:26.032 --> 1:17:26.946
Mom, just take him.

1:17:28.078 --> 1:17:28.861
- Emily, what are you gonna do?

1:17:29.035 --> 1:17:30.341
- Mom, go.

1:17:30.515 --> 1:17:32.212
-  Come on,
Karen, time's a-wastin'.

1:17:34.388 --> 1:17:35.607
- Hey it's me.

1:17:35.781 --> 1:17:37.000
I need you to get
the plane ready.

1:17:37.174 --> 1:17:38.915
I need to get out of
town, lay low for a bit.

1:17:39.089 --> 1:17:41.221
-  Do you have any
idea what time it is?

1:17:41.395 --> 1:17:43.267
- Yeah I know what
goddamn time it is.

1:17:43.441 --> 1:17:44.877
You wake his ass up.

1:17:45.051 --> 1:17:47.575
No idea that shit I've
been through tonight.

1:17:47.750 --> 1:17:49.403
Goddammit.

1:17:49.577 --> 1:17:50.274
-  You want me to grab
the boys and make a haul?

1:17:50.448 --> 1:17:51.231
- No.

1:17:51.405 --> 1:17:53.016
Business as usual.

1:17:53.190 --> 1:17:54.670
And you tell the runners
to take the back road you--

1:17:57.281 --> 1:17:58.412
Hold the line.

1:18:14.341 --> 1:18:16.300
Hurry up, you hear me?

1:18:16.474 --> 1:18:17.823
Hurry that shit up!

1:18:23.481 --> 1:18:25.265
- It's yours, brothers!

1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:30.314
Come on out, Colt!

1:18:31.184 --> 1:18:32.838
We know you're in there.

1:18:50.900 --> 1:18:52.466
You got a lot of innocent
people killed, slick.

1:18:54.425 --> 1:18:55.992
Their blood's on your hands.

1:18:58.298 --> 1:19:00.561
How's it feel knowin'
you're gonna die tonight?

1:19:02.520 --> 1:19:04.348
- I don't know.

1:19:04.522 --> 1:19:05.697
The night's still young.

1:19:09.614 --> 1:19:12.269
- When death took
you, where did you go?

1:19:15.141 --> 1:19:17.187
I mean, what did you see?

1:19:18.884 --> 1:19:20.843
The Afterworld's just
no place for a man.

1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:24.063
So tell me,

1:19:26.239 --> 1:19:28.241
what else is out there
beyond the borders?

1:19:30.896 --> 1:19:32.158
- Let's just say that
where you're goin'

1:19:32.332 --> 1:19:34.900
and where I'm goin', two
very different places.

1:19:36.206 --> 1:19:37.990
So you better pucker
up sweet cakes.

1:19:43.082 --> 1:19:46.085
- Oh I'm gonna miss that
quick tongue of yours.

1:19:46.259 --> 1:19:47.173
Kill him.

1:19:47.347 --> 1:19:48.174
- Wait.

1:19:51.917 --> 1:19:53.049
There's a man inside.

1:19:54.224 --> 1:19:56.139
He's gonna die
without the scepter.

1:19:58.097 --> 1:20:00.186
I'm willing to trade
my life for his.

1:20:01.579 --> 1:20:03.581
- What makes you think
I have it with me?

1:20:05.626 --> 1:20:07.585
- 'Cause I know you Willie.

1:20:07.759 --> 1:20:09.587
You wouldn't let it
out of your sight.

1:20:12.459 --> 1:20:13.243
- You're right.

1:20:14.200 --> 1:20:15.245
I do have it.

1:20:16.942 --> 1:20:18.944
But there's one little problem.

1:20:20.511 --> 1:20:23.383
You've got nothin'
left to bargain with.

1:20:23.557 --> 1:20:24.863
Now mow him down!

1:20:41.924 --> 1:20:43.012
Let's get 'em!

1:21:03.162 --> 1:21:05.295
- Doc!

1:21:05.469 --> 1:21:07.036
- Damn Lucy.

1:21:07.210 --> 1:21:08.907
You scared the holy
hell out of me.

1:21:10.300 --> 1:21:12.215
We need to get Ethan
to the hospital.

1:21:26.142 --> 1:21:26.925
- Woo.

1:21:28.535 --> 1:21:31.582
That is one dirty, sick
little werewolf, isn't he?

1:21:31.756 --> 1:21:33.192
- Nice job, Mr. Mayor.

1:21:33.366 --> 1:21:34.237
- Hey, you know, don't
thank me too soon.

1:21:34.411 --> 1:21:36.848
- What the hell Bob?

1:21:37.022 --> 1:21:38.632
- As far as I can
tell, well these things

1:21:38.806 --> 1:21:39.895
aint after you and me.

1:21:41.287 --> 1:21:43.028
They're after you,
hotshot, aint that right?

1:21:44.508 --> 1:21:46.249
What say you and
me take little walk outside?

1:21:46.423 --> 1:21:48.468
I hand you over, and
then the good folks

1:21:48.642 --> 1:21:50.296
of this town can go night-night.

1:21:51.602 --> 1:21:54.344
And me, well, I'll
live to see me another

1:21:54.518 --> 1:21:56.607
election cycle, you like that?

1:21:56.781 --> 1:21:57.695
- They'll kill you.

1:21:59.218 --> 1:22:01.307
- Oh I can take care of
myself, I assure you that.

1:22:01.481 --> 1:22:04.223
Why don't you sit down
and watch a man work.

1:22:04.397 --> 1:22:06.704
I've been a cop over 15 years.

1:22:06.878 --> 1:22:11.187
I've taken down rapists,
thugs, murderers.

1:22:11.361 --> 1:22:13.102
Hell you know somethin',
I've even taken down

1:22:13.276 --> 1:22:15.191
the odd politician,
you know that?

1:22:16.583 --> 1:22:18.498
What is that smell?

1:22:33.557 --> 1:22:34.950
- Hey.

1:22:35.124 --> 1:22:36.821
Are you all right?

1:22:36.995 --> 1:22:37.822
- Yeah.

1:22:39.215 --> 1:22:40.042
I'm okay.

1:22:41.521 --> 1:22:45.264
- I'm sorry I got you
involved in all this.

1:22:45.438 --> 1:22:48.833
- Well we're in this
together now, right?

1:22:50.878 --> 1:22:51.705
- Come on.

1:22:55.622 --> 1:22:57.320
- Hawkins aint
comin' out, Willie.

1:22:57.494 --> 1:23:00.192
Why don't we storm in
there and take 'em all out?

1:23:02.064 --> 1:23:04.327
I don't mean no
disrespect, but why are we

1:23:04.501 --> 1:23:06.111
playing these games?

1:23:06.285 --> 1:23:09.245
- Well Morgan, that's why
I've always been in charge

1:23:09.419 --> 1:23:11.464
of this gang instead of you.

1:23:17.166 --> 1:23:18.776
- First light's
coming up, Wilie.

1:23:18.950 --> 1:23:20.517
What are we gonna do?

1:23:32.572 --> 1:23:34.705
- Let's ride!

1:24:03.690 --> 1:24:05.214
- Lucy.

1:24:05.388 --> 1:24:07.172
It's time for you
to get out now.

1:24:07.346 --> 1:24:08.217
- Colt--
- Lucy.

1:24:09.261 --> 1:24:10.045
Go.

1:24:17.313 --> 1:24:18.270
- Be careful.

1:24:24.146 --> 1:24:26.409
- You're mine, skinner.

1:25:28.775 --> 1:25:30.212
- Come out Willie!

1:26:05.508 --> 1:26:07.597
- Do you recognize these?

1:26:09.338 --> 1:26:10.774
Of course you do.

1:27:19.799 --> 1:27:21.148
Oh, come on now Colt.

1:27:21.323 --> 1:27:22.237
Don't tell me you're gonna quit

1:27:22.411 --> 1:27:23.629
because of a couple cuts.

1:27:25.501 --> 1:27:28.286
I mean, even your wife put
up a bigger fight than that.

1:28:09.109 --> 1:28:10.372
Good bye, Colt.

1:28:14.767 --> 1:28:16.116
You fool.

1:28:16.291 --> 1:28:17.466
