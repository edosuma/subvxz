00:02.569 --> 00:04.505
- Get Bea to a nunnery!
- What? No!

00:04.571 --> 00:06.073
- But it's over, Frederick.
- No.

00:06.139 --> 00:07.474
Are you sure we've never met?

00:07.541 --> 00:09.309
My Prince Charming left a clue.

00:09.376 --> 00:10.744
Let me escort you

00:10.811 --> 00:12.546
to the asylum, Blanche.

00:12.613 --> 00:17.050
We're gonna take you far away
to someplace you can relax.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.590
I'll see you in five years.

00:23.657 --> 00:27.060
Well, another family day concluded.

00:27.127 --> 00:30.030
Thank you, Garfield, for serving us.

00:30.097 --> 00:31.665
Though, it must have been easy for you

00:31.732 --> 00:36.870
since you have no family
and nobody loves you.

Can you direct me
to the outdoor seating area?

02:39.593 --> 02:43.530
I'd like to enjoy
my gray slop al fresco.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.939
Not exactly the chicken kiev
at Delmonico's,

02:52.005 --> 02:54.942
but it will do.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.476
You have... you have to wipe your face.

02:56.543 --> 02:57.978
There's food coming out of your mouth.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.713
Hey, fancy girl.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.783
You are sitting at our euchre table.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.586
Ladies, I had no idea. My apologies.

03:05.652 --> 03:08.755
- And my name's Lillian.
- Mm.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.157
Hey!

03:10.224 --> 03:11.558
Yeah, you can't sit here.

03:11.625 --> 03:12.759
No, no, no. I think someone's

03:12.826 --> 03:13.894
gonna have to teach you a lesson.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.128
No thank you.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.763
There's a reason why I had my family

03:16.830 --> 03:19.433
pay a poor person to go
to school in my place.

03:19.499 --> 03:22.536
Ah! Oh! Ah, ah.

03:22.603 --> 03:25.506
- Ahh!
- Berfa!

03:25.572 --> 03:28.041
Back off.

03:28.108 --> 03:29.343
The short bitch is with me.

03:29.409 --> 03:31.745
Blanche.

03:31.812 --> 03:35.282
Mama Blanche.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.417
Sorry, Mama Blanche.

03:37.484 --> 03:38.485
We... we didn't know.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.187
- Oh, you didn't know.
- Mm-mm.

03:40.254 --> 03:41.555
Scram!

03:41.622 --> 03:43.090
Oh, thank God you're here.

03:43.156 --> 03:46.293
I'll need you to launder and
starch this dress immediately.

03:46.360 --> 03:50.731
Ahh! Ah, uh...

03:50.797 --> 03:53.333
Let's get one thing straight.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.668
I was your servant on the outside,

03:54.735 --> 03:57.337
but in here you're mine.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.574
- Got it?
- Yes.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.910
Rape!

04:02.976 --> 04:05.145
You wish.

04:10.551 --> 04:11.919
- Beatrice.
- Frederick.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.520
It's funny seeing you here.
I used to have to

04:13.587 --> 04:15.422
drag you to servant ball
when we were together.

04:15.489 --> 04:18.524
Well, I was always better
at it than you.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.194
Ahh!

04:20.260 --> 04:22.462
- Ah!
- So how have you been?

04:22.529 --> 04:24.198
Because I've been really great.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.200
- Good, even.
- Oh, I, too, as well.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.902
In fact, I'm probably
the most good I've ever been.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.070
- Hm.
- In fact,

04:30.137 --> 04:31.738
I met someone special at the ball.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.474
Beatrice! I'm shocked at the
insensitivity of your language.

04:34.541 --> 04:37.578
We do not say someone special.
We say mongoloid.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.346
No, I mean I met a man.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.014
I don't know his name
or what he looks like,

04:41.081 --> 04:42.416
but we are very much in love.

04:42.482 --> 04:44.785
That's odd because
I met a woman at the ball

04:44.852 --> 04:46.653
and too am very much in love

04:46.720 --> 04:48.422
and too do not know her name.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.290
- Stop aping me, Frederick.
- I'm not aping you!

04:50.357 --> 04:52.826
I did meet someone!

04:52.893 --> 04:54.728
Ah.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.563
The question is, if you're
so in love with him,

04:56.630 --> 04:57.698
why don't you know his name?

04:57.764 --> 04:58.999
Well, if you're so in love with her,

04:59.066 --> 05:00.667
why don't you know her name?

05:00.734 --> 05:02.369
I don't see the connection.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.939
You know what? You can servant bowl

05:06.006 --> 05:07.140
by yourself today.

05:07.207 --> 05:08.575
I'm, gonna go find my beloved

05:08.642 --> 05:10.377
and he's gonna make me happier
than you ever did.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.378
- Fine!
- Good!

05:11.445 --> 05:12.379
Bye!

05:12.446 --> 05:14.781
Bye! Good.

05:14.848 --> 05:15.949
Fine!

05:18.352 --> 05:20.254
Here's how this place works:

05:20.320 --> 05:23.457
the guards, they're out to get us.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.158
You get caught in here,
you get dragged back

05:25.225 --> 05:27.194
- to the treatment room.
- Ah.

05:27.261 --> 05:29.329
And you wind up like that.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.967
As for the patients,
there's two basic types.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.203
There's the crazies and the non-crazies.

05:36.270 --> 05:39.439
That's Mildred.
She killed her whole family.

05:39.506 --> 05:42.242
Trudy, she said no to her husband once.

05:42.309 --> 05:45.012
There's Lois, she thinks
she's Mary Magdalene.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.414
And then we got Connie.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.316
She's Asian.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.718
The asylum's a scary place, Lillian.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.454
And to survive here, you need a friend.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.290
You wanna be my friend, Lillian?

05:56.356 --> 05:58.091
I'm not gonna
lick your [bleep], Blanche,

05:58.158 --> 06:00.160
if that's what you're asking.

06:00.227 --> 06:02.162
No.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.164
When they give you your daily meds,

06:04.231 --> 06:05.999
don't swallow 'em.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.467
- Should I snort them?
- No.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.536
I need you to lip 'em.
Stick 'em in your lips, capiche?

06:09.603 --> 06:11.505
I'm sorry, Blanche,
but I don't speak guinea.

06:11.572 --> 06:15.042
- Capiche?
- Capiche.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.010
Good.

06:17.744 --> 06:20.804
And when you get a second,
I need you to lick my [bleep].

06:21.315 --> 06:22.249
Fine.

06:25.752 --> 06:28.288
Hortense, I need help
and I don't know who to talk to

06:28.355 --> 06:29.723
now that Lillian's in the cuckoo's nest.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.625
Don't have sympathy for her,

06:31.692 --> 06:34.027
- she is now amongst her equals.
- I don't.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.596
I have symphony for me.

06:35.662 --> 06:37.731
Now that she's gone,
I have no one to talk to.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.266
Zero people in the whole world.

06:39.333 --> 06:42.102
That is incorrect.
You are talking to me right now.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.804
I don't have time for riddles, Hortense.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.239
I need help finding my beloved,

06:45.305 --> 06:48.842
and the only clue I have is this ring.

06:51.512 --> 06:55.115
Let me see that.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.684
Hortense, you have those glass eyes.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.454
Maybe you can write him
a really smart letter for me.

07:05.726 --> 07:08.529
And how would you get a letter
to a man you don't know?

07:08.595 --> 07:09.763
Message in a bottle.

07:09.830 --> 07:12.132
Letters on land don't work that way.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.535
Stop shitting on my dreams, Hortense.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.036
Just because you're always
going to be alone

07:16.103 --> 07:18.305
doesn't mean I have to be.

07:18.372 --> 07:22.009
The ring belongs...

07:22.075 --> 07:23.844
On second thought, of course I will

07:23.911 --> 07:25.779
help you write that letter.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.482
I am your sister, after all.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.750
Please don't spread that around.

07:29.816 --> 07:32.619
How shall we begin?

07:32.686 --> 07:35.322
- Dear...
- Mm-hmm.

07:35.389 --> 07:37.729
- My...
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

08:16.533 --> 08:17.675
The time has come.

08:17.740 --> 08:19.275
I'm going to march
right down to that orphanage

08:19.342 --> 08:21.311
and I'm gonna talk to Mrs. Sn...

08:21.377 --> 08:22.445
Huh.

08:22.512 --> 08:26.736
Sn... Mrs. Snagsby.

08:33.355 --> 08:34.990
Garfield?

08:35.057 --> 08:36.424
Is that you?

08:36.491 --> 08:37.960
The boy becomes a man.

08:38.025 --> 08:39.995
Come here and hug these old bones.

08:40.062 --> 08:42.364
Oh, yes!

08:42.431 --> 08:44.433
- Mm.
- Now, tell me,

08:44.500 --> 08:46.034
to what do I owe this visit?

08:46.101 --> 08:48.170
Hello, Mrs. Snagsby,
I was just wondering

08:48.237 --> 08:51.473
if you had any information
about my parents.

08:51.540 --> 08:54.176
Don't you remember the rhyme
that I used to tell you orphans?

08:54.243 --> 08:55.677
Do you remember?

08:55.744 --> 08:58.514
- Parents hate us. Yes.
- Parents hate you. Yes!

08:58.580 --> 08:59.815
Good boy.

08:59.882 --> 09:01.984
I never understood
why you called that a rhyme.

09:02.050 --> 09:04.486
All you need to know

09:04.553 --> 09:06.989
is that they left you on a curb.

09:07.055 --> 09:09.925
Um, please, Mrs. Snagsby,

09:09.992 --> 09:11.593
please, just help me with anything.

09:11.660 --> 09:14.029
- I'll do anything!
- Anything?

09:14.096 --> 09:15.864
- Yes.
- Anything, is that right?

09:15.931 --> 09:18.834
Come here. Come to Mrs. Snagsby.

09:18.901 --> 09:21.437
Do you remember basement bubbles?

09:21.503 --> 09:24.106
Please! Please, don't make me
do basement bubbles.

09:24.173 --> 09:26.675
- Please, Mrs. Snags...
- You want the information,

09:26.742 --> 09:28.610
and I want the bubbles!

09:28.677 --> 09:29.745
- Oh.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.985
Now, please, tell me who my parents are.

10:43.051 --> 10:45.754
Oh, Garfield, I'm so sorry.

10:45.821 --> 10:48.824
When you moved out,
we burned all your records.

10:48.891 --> 10:50.859
But thank you for my bubbles.

10:50.926 --> 10:52.694
Oh!

10:52.761 --> 10:55.030
I'll never forget.

11:00.903 --> 11:03.739
- Who said that?
- What is this?

11:03.806 --> 11:06.108
Candy.

11:06.175 --> 11:07.609
No!

11:07.676 --> 11:09.945
It's a message in a bottle.

11:10.012 --> 11:11.780
Frederick, it must be for you.

11:11.847 --> 11:13.449
How do you know?
That note could be for anyone.

11:13.515 --> 11:15.451
- "Dear My Beloved..."
- Oh, it is for me.

11:15.517 --> 11:17.019
"Since meeting you at the ball,

11:17.085 --> 11:18.620
I do not know who you are at all."

11:18.687 --> 11:20.889
"If you want to talk to me,

11:20.956 --> 11:22.958
leave me a note by the oak tree."

11:23.025 --> 11:24.960
Oh! I know that tree.

11:25.027 --> 11:26.228
What should I do?
Should I throw a bottle

11:26.295 --> 11:27.663
in the other direction?

11:27.729 --> 11:29.998
- Or send a homing pigeon?
- I think you should write back.

11:30.065 --> 11:32.601
Yes. Perfect. Now make haste!

11:32.668 --> 11:36.505
I must find my beloved
before Beatrice finds hers.

11:38.140 --> 11:39.274
Ahh!

11:39.341 --> 11:41.176
Ohh, that's not candy!

11:41.243 --> 11:45.013
That's not candy!

11:45.080 --> 11:46.315
Ow!

11:46.381 --> 11:47.783
Now I understand

11:47.850 --> 11:51.553
why Lillian and Beatrice
are so needlessly cruel.

11:51.620 --> 11:53.722
It feels wonderful!

12:02.931 --> 12:05.167
Garfield. What is the meaning of this?

12:05.234 --> 12:06.769
I have told you a thousand times,

12:06.835 --> 12:07.970
under no circumstances...

12:08.036 --> 12:09.371
including the death of a loved one...

12:09.438 --> 12:10.606
is a man allowed to cry.

12:10.672 --> 12:13.008
Mr. Peepers.

12:13.075 --> 12:16.011
Mrs. Snagsby... I went to see her.

12:16.078 --> 12:17.613
What? I've told you never to go there.

12:17.679 --> 12:19.581
She made me do things.

12:19.648 --> 12:21.083
She made me do

12:21.150 --> 12:22.184
basement bubbles.

12:22.251 --> 12:24.753
Basement bub... basement bub...

12:24.820 --> 12:26.355
basement bubbles?

12:26.421 --> 12:27.456
That monster.

12:27.523 --> 12:29.658
That cruel, evil creature.

12:29.725 --> 12:30.893
Why would you return to that place?

12:30.959 --> 12:33.195
Because I wanted to find my family.

12:33.262 --> 12:35.564
I wanted to know why they gave me up.

12:35.631 --> 12:37.800
But... but now I'll never know.

12:37.866 --> 12:39.735
Never!

12:39.802 --> 12:41.537
Oh, Garfield.
I know who your parents are.

12:43.705 --> 12:45.874
But... you... how?

12:45.941 --> 12:47.976
I do a background check
on all the new hires.

12:48.043 --> 12:49.945
Please, Mr. Peepers.
Please, Mr. Peepers.

12:50.012 --> 12:51.313
Please help me find my family.

12:51.380 --> 12:53.248
Please, oh, please! Please, oh, please!

12:53.315 --> 12:54.616
Oh, all right. I'll take you, boy.

12:54.683 --> 12:56.485
But for the record,

12:56.551 --> 12:58.752
it's never a good idea
to meet one's parents.

12:59.347 --> 13:01.518
Aha! There's your parents' house.

13:03.734 --> 13:05.630
Before we do this,

13:05.678 --> 13:08.169
I just want to tell you that
my search for my birth parents

13:08.240 --> 13:10.953
does in no way change
how much I love you.

13:11.008 --> 13:12.078
I do not care for that word

13:12.140 --> 13:13.437
and do not reciprocate your feelings.

13:13.461 --> 13:15.830
I've always thought of you as...

13:15.897 --> 13:17.132
as a father!

13:18.867 --> 13:23.138
And I have rarely
thought of you at all, Garfield.

13:23.204 --> 13:24.539
Good-bye, Garfield.

13:24.606 --> 13:26.941
This won't end well.

13:27.008 --> 13:29.077
Good-bye, Mr. Peepers.

13:29.144 --> 13:31.479
Good-bye!

13:41.556 --> 13:42.657
May I help you?

13:48.604 --> 13:52.007
All right, bitch. Give me the pills.

13:55.177 --> 13:57.813
Ew. What the hell?

13:57.879 --> 13:59.214
Well, you said to lip them.

13:59.281 --> 14:01.583
Ohh, wrong lips.

14:01.650 --> 14:03.619
The important thing is to get the pills.

14:03.685 --> 14:05.854
It does seem like a good place
to store things, though.

14:05.921 --> 14:07.089
Your vagina.

14:07.155 --> 14:09.057
I've always been fashion forward.

14:09.124 --> 14:12.060
Uhh! No!

14:13.262 --> 14:14.930
Okay, this is it, Lillian.

14:14.997 --> 14:17.399
Give it to her. Give it to her!

14:17.466 --> 14:18.634
- Yah!
- Whoa, hey, what the hell?

14:18.700 --> 14:20.569
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

14:20.636 --> 14:22.104
What... uh...

14:22.170 --> 14:24.106
- I'm confused.
- Give her the pills.

14:24.172 --> 14:25.207
Oh.

14:27.342 --> 14:28.410
Ah!

14:28.477 --> 14:32.014
Ew. Uh!

14:32.080 --> 14:34.950
Ha, ha!

14:35.017 --> 14:37.052
Whoo!

14:37.119 --> 14:40.055
Wow! Thank you, Blanche.

14:40.122 --> 14:43.492
And Lillian, I am so sorry
about earlier.

14:43.559 --> 14:45.394
I'm confused. What's going on here?

14:45.460 --> 14:47.796
I've been regulating
the medication of the patients.

14:47.835 --> 14:48.897
Helping the most vulnerable women

14:48.964 --> 14:50.165
get the medicine they need.

14:50.232 --> 14:51.400
Why, what did you think we were doing?

14:51.466 --> 14:52.868
Starting a drug ring, which would

14:52.935 --> 14:54.336
spread to other asylums and from there,

14:54.403 --> 14:56.104
trickle down to the nation's
poorest neighborhoods,

14:56.171 --> 14:58.373
which we would control
through ruthless violence.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.275
No, it was to help people.

15:02.444 --> 15:06.481
Well, that's the stupidest
[bleep] thing I've ever heard.

15:06.548 --> 15:08.684
Well, I thought we were
moving product here, Blanche.

15:08.750 --> 15:10.018
We could be making so much money.

15:10.085 --> 15:13.088
What would we do with money?

15:13.155 --> 15:15.691
What would we do with money?

15:15.757 --> 15:17.626
A lot of things!

15:17.693 --> 15:20.429
If we had money,
we could get better food,

15:20.495 --> 15:22.264
a new tether ball.

15:22.331 --> 15:24.066
Shit, I love tether ball.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.335
Maybe some ottomans and chaise lounges.

15:26.401 --> 15:27.603
Shit, I love a chaise.

15:27.669 --> 15:29.404
Joanna, we could finally get you

15:29.471 --> 15:31.540
a proper noose to hang yourself.

15:31.607 --> 15:33.408
But if they catch us, they'll fry us.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.010
They'll put us all
in the treatment room.

15:35.077 --> 15:38.247
The treatment room is
a myth for all we know.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.516
But money is real.

15:41.583 --> 15:43.185
I was rich on the outside.

15:43.252 --> 15:45.621
Blanche was my servant.

15:45.687 --> 15:47.222
She's crazy, she's crazy.

15:47.289 --> 15:48.991
Sometimes I would have her
make me chipped beef,

15:49.057 --> 15:50.826
just so I could dump it on her head.

15:50.893 --> 15:52.227
- No.
- Let's find out

15:52.294 --> 15:54.329
how many pills each of you can hold.

15:54.396 --> 15:58.200
Blanche, get a tape measure and stool.

15:58.267 --> 16:00.502
We've got some drugs to lip.

16:00.569 --> 16:04.072
Once again, I'm in charge
and Blanche is my servant.

16:04.139 --> 16:06.508
Well, we are both incarcerated
in a mental institution,

16:06.575 --> 16:08.310
but the power dynamic's shifted.

16:14.516 --> 16:18.053
Um, did you ever think of me?

16:19.021 --> 16:20.055
- No.
- Mm-mm.

16:20.122 --> 16:21.323
Mm-mm, no.

16:21.390 --> 16:24.126
Well, did you ever wonder where I was?

16:24.192 --> 16:26.228
Oh, we knew where you were.

16:26.295 --> 16:27.696
At the orphanage.

16:27.763 --> 16:30.198
Where we left you.

16:30.265 --> 16:32.067
- Fond memory.
- Mm-hmm.

16:32.134 --> 16:33.402
- That was a good day.
- Mm-hmm.

16:35.137 --> 16:38.473
Ah, our beautiful beloved
blonde children.

16:38.540 --> 16:39.474
- Ohh!
- Have a seat.

16:41.443 --> 16:44.112
Oh, you... you had more children.

16:44.179 --> 16:47.282
Oh, yes. We've always wanted
a happy and full home.

16:47.349 --> 16:50.586
As a matter of fact, we have
another little one on the way.

16:50.652 --> 16:55.057
I don't understand why, then,
you gave me up for adoption.

16:55.123 --> 16:56.658
Could you not afford a child?

16:56.725 --> 16:58.627
No, no, I've always been very affluent.

16:58.694 --> 17:00.128
We could afford 50 children.

17:00.195 --> 17:01.897
Ah!

17:01.964 --> 17:05.934
Well, then, why?

17:06.001 --> 17:07.769
Is it because of my hair?

17:07.836 --> 17:10.638
Oh, Garfield, no. It wasn't your hair.

17:10.705 --> 17:12.974
We just didn't love you.

17:13.040 --> 17:15.510
Yes, you were... unlovable.

17:15.577 --> 17:17.980
But I'm most loveable boy you ever met.

17:18.046 --> 17:19.146
I'm very loveable.

17:19.214 --> 17:20.648
And I love to help around the house.

17:20.715 --> 17:23.618
And I love to clean,
and... and... do gardening

17:23.685 --> 17:24.853
and... and scrub!

17:24.920 --> 17:27.689
And dust! I'll show you,
I'll dust right now!

17:27.756 --> 17:29.958
- Yes, look. Look at me go.
- Oh, no.

17:30.025 --> 17:31.360
Oh, Garfield, no, no, no, no.

17:31.426 --> 17:33.896
- Stop.
- Sweetheart, just let him.

17:33.962 --> 17:36.732
All right, boy. Well, have at it.

17:36.798 --> 17:38.500
We're gonna enjoy some supper.

17:38.567 --> 17:39.501
- Come with me.
- Yes.

17:39.568 --> 17:40.502
Okay, Mommy.

17:40.569 --> 17:43.705
Don't call her that.

17:43.772 --> 17:45.073
- Sorry, Daddy.
- No.

17:45.140 --> 17:46.508
- Mm-mm.
- That neither.

17:46.575 --> 17:47.676
- No.
- Come, come.

17:47.743 --> 17:50.078
Come, children.

17:50.145 --> 17:51.780
I have a brother and sister.

17:51.847 --> 17:53.148
No, you don't!

18:32.621 --> 18:35.457
I told Beatrice I would go to the tree

18:35.524 --> 18:39.094
and procure the letter from her lover.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.396
Ooh.

18:44.266 --> 18:46.034
Sister!

18:46.101 --> 18:47.769
This candy tastes like bugs.

18:47.836 --> 18:49.905
My work.

18:49.972 --> 18:52.241
A letter has arrived!

18:52.307 --> 18:54.843
Oh. What does it say?

18:54.910 --> 18:57.546
- "Dear Person."
- Ohh.

18:57.613 --> 19:00.449
"Meet me on Wednesday
at sunset by the big tree."

19:00.515 --> 19:02.818
- Oh, that is so romantic.
- Oh.

19:02.884 --> 19:05.254
Oh, Hortense, I feel like something good

19:05.320 --> 19:07.089
might finally happen for me.

19:07.155 --> 19:10.092
A lot of good things
have happened for you.

19:10.158 --> 19:11.660
Oh, I mean other than the way I look

19:11.727 --> 19:14.296
and my personality and my money
and my continual good fortune,

19:14.363 --> 19:15.664
obviously.

19:15.731 --> 19:17.432
Just think, you are going
to meet the man

19:17.499 --> 19:20.569
who will help you get over our
brother Frederick forever.

19:20.636 --> 19:22.671
Oh, I can't wait to spend
the rest of my life with him.

19:22.738 --> 19:25.340
I can't wait to watch you do it.

19:25.407 --> 19:28.677
If you were 10% prettier,
I would hug you right now.

19:28.744 --> 19:29.778
Ohh.

19:29.845 --> 19:33.215
- Have another candy.
- Mmm.

19:34.917 --> 19:36.418
Mmm, still bugs.

19:36.485 --> 19:37.486
Hm.

19:54.202 --> 19:56.505
Basement bubbles, indeed.

19:59.669 --> 20:02.074
My family will love me
if I make this a little bear.

20:02.137 --> 20:04.406
Yes, my father's a big bear

20:04.473 --> 20:07.643
and here's a little bear
for the big bear.

20:07.701 --> 20:09.286
Garfield.

20:09.343 --> 20:12.179
- Garfield, stop.
- No, my family loves me.

20:12.246 --> 20:14.214
Look at the bear, Peepers, look!

20:14.281 --> 20:16.350
No! They'll never love you!

20:16.416 --> 20:18.318
No matter what!

20:18.385 --> 20:20.988
Come, let's go home.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.055
I made a bear.

20:22.122 --> 20:23.857
It's a very nice bear.

20:23.924 --> 20:25.926
You have one reason to smile.

20:25.993 --> 20:28.395
You'll never have to worry
about Mrs. Snagsby

20:28.462 --> 20:30.597
and her basement bubbles ever again.

20:30.664 --> 20:32.466
Well, that's good.

20:32.532 --> 20:35.041
If I had to clean that dirty
basement one more time,

20:35.088 --> 20:36.432
I don't know what I'd do.

20:36.502 --> 20:38.605
Of course... wait.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.438
Clean the basement?
Is that what she had you doing?

20:40.500 --> 20:42.776
- It wasn't a euphemism?
- No!

20:42.843 --> 20:44.878
We cleaned the dirty basement.

20:44.945 --> 20:48.181
It's very scary down there.
There's spiders everywhere

20:48.248 --> 20:49.316
and I hate spiders.

20:49.383 --> 20:51.151
Just yuck.

20:51.218 --> 20:52.715
Why, what did you think we were doing?

20:52.749 --> 20:54.151
Hm? Oh, nothing.

20:54.176 --> 20:56.237
Uh, let's walk faster.

20:56.292 --> 20:57.993
- Okay.
- Come on.

20:58.060 --> 21:00.196
<i>Oh! Oh, we're running now.</i>

21:00.675 --> 21:03.151
Write back saying that I want to meet...

21:03.199 --> 21:04.362
do you have all that?

21:04.410 --> 21:06.456
Perhaps a location and a time.

21:06.511 --> 21:08.448
A location and a time?

21:08.514 --> 21:10.316
Ohh! All right.

21:10.383 --> 21:12.285
Oh, this is hard.

21:12.351 --> 21:14.120
Ahh!
