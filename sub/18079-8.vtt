00:41.508 --> 00:44.375
This may be the most
important document ever
to come into my possession.

00:45.178 --> 00:47.874
He wants to trade the rest
of it to have Thanksgiving
with his daughter.

00:49.916 --> 00:53.079
When he calls back,
give him the green light.

00:53.153 --> 00:57.954
I ran a preliminary.
It seems that
Able Seventeen or Able Eight

00:58.024 --> 00:59.491
would be best suited
for the job.

00:59.559 --> 01:03.586
He wants the A-Team.
He knows I've got them.
That's why he called me.

01:04.063 --> 01:08.228
General, they don't seem
to fit the profile.
It's hardly their style.

01:08.301 --> 01:12.499
The information in this
diary could bring down
half the men in Washington.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.499
Knowledge is power.

01:17.043 --> 01:18.840
And I want that knowledge.

01:20.447 --> 01:21.880
And he wants the A-Team.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.279
He gets them.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.411
(GUN FlRlNG)

03:12.559 --> 03:17.496
"Forever yours,
Templeton Peck."

03:18.598 --> 03:22.227
You know, I think
next Thanksgiving, I'm gonna
use pre-signed cards.

03:23.469 --> 03:26.233
You know, this is the
first time I'm spending
Thanksgiving

03:26.306 --> 03:27.603
away from my parents.

03:27.674 --> 03:30.768
Hey man, it don't matter
where you are.
It's where your heart is.

03:30.843 --> 03:32.208
And that's where
your family's at.

03:32.278 --> 03:34.075
FACE: B.A., you know
he's got a point.

03:34.414 --> 03:37.679
Christmas, Thanksgiving,
those are family holidays.

03:37.817 --> 03:41.583
Family, you know, the mom and
the dad and 2.3 kids,

03:42.055 --> 03:43.920
station wagon in the garage...

03:44.023 --> 03:46.856
Yo, Murdock, I'm trying
to make a shot here.

03:48.995 --> 03:50.656
Look, why don't you
just go in there,

03:50.730 --> 03:52.357
tell Johnny you couldn't
get the turkey for him?

03:52.432 --> 03:55.265
It's just that I find
this all so ironic.

03:55.802 --> 03:59.203
I mean, there is
the Colonel in there,
slaving over a hot stove

03:59.272 --> 04:03.265
to fix me a big juicy
Thanksgiving dinner,
and, I mean...

04:03.543 --> 04:06.341
Ever since I've been
tending turkeys, I mean...

04:06.412 --> 04:08.243
Well, that's just the
biggest mistake I ever made.

04:08.314 --> 04:12.876
Well, like they say, never get
too friendly with a bird
you're gonna eat.

04:16.221 --> 04:20.851
Hannibal's famous Four Day
Turkey-Eating Experience
is about to begin.

04:20.927 --> 04:24.454
The sauce is simmering,
the stuffing is terrific,

04:24.530 --> 04:27.090
the assistant chef
is getting impatient,

04:27.600 --> 04:29.465
where's the bird?

04:30.770 --> 04:34.137
Colonel, I just can't,
I mean,

04:34.707 --> 04:39.474
now that I work around
turkeys all day long,
I mean, I'm sorry.

04:39.545 --> 04:42.480
Murdock got a little
closer to the main course
than he wanted to.

04:42.615 --> 04:46.381
Oh. Never get too friendly
with a bird you're
gonna eat, Murdock.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.578
Well said.

04:47.654 --> 04:50.316
I'm sure I could rustle
up some soup for you.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.415
HANNlBAL: But the rest of us,
we've gotta have a turkey.

04:52.492 --> 04:53.789
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.953
I think he's too big
for the pot.

04:56.029 --> 05:00.125
What are you doing here?
Didn't you promise us
a week off for the holidays?

05:00.199 --> 05:02.997
I don't recall using the word
"promise," Lieutenant.

05:03.069 --> 05:07.165
In exactly 48 hours, you're
going to help reunite a wanted
criminal and his daughter.

05:07.240 --> 05:11.609
And in the process,
bring down half the crooked
politicians in Washington.

05:12.111 --> 05:15.012
I guess we'll have to
turn the sauce off.

05:18.551 --> 05:23.045
A.J. Bancroft was a member
of the Congressional
kitchen cabinet in the 60s.

05:23.122 --> 05:25.920
He was one of the most
powerful non-political men
in Washington

05:25.992 --> 05:28.051
until his indiscretions
were discovered.

05:28.127 --> 05:31.028
Yes, he was indicted
on 22 counts,
including conspiracy.

05:31.731 --> 05:34.325
Well, you have
to know something when
you're tending turkeys.

05:34.967 --> 05:38.403
Hey, man, if this guy
is such bad news,
why you want us to help him?

05:38.471 --> 05:40.336
Bancroft kept a diary.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.638
A complete history
of everyone
he conspired with.

05:43.710 --> 05:47.737
The swap. A visit
with his daughter for
a list of crooked politicians.

05:47.914 --> 05:50.212
One that I will
put to good use.

05:50.283 --> 05:54.686
I'll bet. A list like that
could make a man very
powerful in Washington.

05:56.089 --> 05:59.718
Don't insult me, Colonel.
Blackmail is not my style.

06:00.159 --> 06:02.593
It isn't?
Then how did I get here?

06:03.129 --> 06:06.963
It won't be long before
certain people in Washington
get wind of A.J.'s return.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.564
They'll do anything
they can to silence him.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.435
Anything.

06:14.073 --> 06:15.973
HANNlBAL: Time is
not in our favor.

06:16.275 --> 06:19.005
B.A., you and Frankie pick up
Ellen in Tallahassee.

06:19.779 --> 06:22.441
We'll meet Bancroft
in St. Augustine.

06:23.149 --> 06:26.915
Check this out.
"At the age of 26,
A.J. Bancroft

06:26.986 --> 06:30.717
"had established himself as
the major force in independent
corporate financing."

06:30.790 --> 06:32.382
The guy must be a genius.

06:32.692 --> 06:34.557
He's a snazzy dresser, too.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.059
And now he's coming back
to see his daughter.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.494
Imagine what he
had to go through.

06:37.563 --> 06:41.294
Him? Imagine what they
went through when he
skipped the country.

06:41.434 --> 06:43.732
Darn it.
Erica is not at home.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.303
Erica?
Yeah, Murdock's
got a girlfriend.

06:46.472 --> 06:49.100
You do?
Maybe, maybe not.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.144
She just moved into
our apartment building

06:53.212 --> 06:55.942
and I met her at the mailboxes
and we kind of hit it off
in a cerebral way.

06:56.015 --> 06:57.676
Yeah?
I asked her if she could
look after my hamster

06:57.750 --> 06:58.774
and she said she would.

06:58.851 --> 07:01.012
Sounds like true love to me.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.452
Congratulations, Murdock,
you know it isn't often that

07:03.523 --> 07:06.890
a girl offers to take
care of a guy's rodent.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.735
Okay, we'll meet at
the Lobster Claw Restaurant
in Daytona

07:20.807 --> 07:21.967
and then get on
to the marina.

07:22.041 --> 07:24.509
Slip number seven to be exact.

07:24.577 --> 07:28.274
And, guys, I have scammed us
a beautiful 70-foot sloop.

07:28.414 --> 07:31.941
Listen, guys, anybody ever
stop to consider that
just possibly,

07:32.018 --> 07:36.250
this Ellen Bancroft is
not too thrilled about
finding her long-lost father?

07:36.556 --> 07:39.582
You know, I mean 20 years,
that's a long time.

07:39.892 --> 07:41.052
HANNlBAL:
You drive first, Face.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.561
All right, I hope this thing
has cruise control.

07:45.631 --> 07:46.893
(ENGlNE REVVlNG)

07:47.633 --> 07:51.467
EDWARDS: Well, the issue here
isn't cruise missiles,
it's dollars and cents.

07:51.537 --> 07:54.597
The President didn't
recommend me for
this position because

07:54.674 --> 07:57.507
I could dismantle a tank
and tell you how it works.

07:58.077 --> 08:01.706
But I can dismantle a
budget, and that's what
the Defense Department needs.

08:01.781 --> 08:05.410
Mr. Edwards, the committee
is well aware of your ability

08:05.485 --> 08:08.750
to dance around
the financial world.

08:14.560 --> 08:18.291
I hate to ask this,
but a very important
phone call just came in.

08:18.364 --> 08:21.231

wouldn't mind...

It's Owens.

08:30.843 --> 08:34.836
Our sources in Barbados
confirm it. Bancroft is
on his way into the country.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.249
I knew he'd pull
something like this.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.712
His timing couldn't
have been worse.

08:41.921 --> 08:44.890
He's come back to pull
me down, but he'll want
to see his daughter first.

08:45.091 --> 08:46.820
Be there when he does.

08:55.234 --> 08:57.361
Permission to come aboard?

10 seconds to explain
what you're doing here.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.265
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

It's all right, Captain.

You're A.J. Bancroft?

09:39.812 --> 09:41.905
The man at the office
said she lived here.

09:41.981 --> 09:44.313
The man at the office
was running out the door
for Thanksgiving.

09:44.383 --> 09:46.010
I just hope she hasn't
left town for the holiday.

09:55.461 --> 09:57.827
Yes. What can I do for you?

09:57.897 --> 10:02.231
Well, my associate and l
have been commissioned by
a party of mutual interest.

10:02.301 --> 10:04.895
I am Frank...
Your father sent us.
He wanna talk to you.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.672
Frank,
you wait down here.

10:21.787 --> 10:25.120
This is really bizarre.
It's hard to believe,
you know?

10:25.658 --> 10:28.821
I mean, what am I supposed
to say to the man?

10:35.067 --> 10:37.627
Maybe we better
take the stairs.

10:56.555 --> 10:57.749
Get them!

11:16.075 --> 11:18.236
You're gonna love this, B.A.

Faceman's gonna be upset.

11:43.602 --> 11:46.833
"Face." That's a
charming nickname.

11:46.906 --> 11:49.397
That's because he's a
charming sort of guy.

11:50.242 --> 11:55.202
We call him "Faceman"
because he is so good-looking

11:55.681 --> 12:00.118
that he can extract the answer
"yes" from you without ever
having asked the question.

12:00.186 --> 12:02.416
Sort of the conman's
tool of the trade, you know?

12:02.988 --> 12:06.082
He doesn't sound like a very
sincere kind of friend.

12:06.158 --> 12:07.750
No, no, no.

12:08.194 --> 12:10.287
He's a great guy.
Always there in a pinch.

12:10.362 --> 12:12.489
He'd rip the shirt
off his back for you.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.999
Then he'd go out and
scam one for himself.

12:15.534 --> 12:18.992
A con man with integrity.
It's an interesting
combination.

12:47.333 --> 12:50.131
Well, at least
that part of the mission
is done with.

12:52.037 --> 12:54.870
Well, I hope you guys
didn't get followed.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.204
Oh, Hannibal.
Sorry, B.A.

13:04.216 --> 13:08.016
That's interesting.
I mean, I've been out with
a few ladies in my time,

13:08.087 --> 13:10.385
but I've never seen one
go to the ladies' room
without her purse.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.788
DlSHPAN: Maybe that's
because they had no
intention of returning.

13:29.775 --> 13:32.676
Get A.J. to the van.
I'll help Hannibal.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.714
I didn't know
it was a bomb.
I swear!

13:40.786 --> 13:42.151
Sure, lady.

13:42.221 --> 13:43.654
What the hell is
going on here?

13:43.722 --> 13:46.350
This whole thing was
a set-up to kill you.
That wasn't your daughter.

13:46.425 --> 13:48.620
But somebody knew
you hadn't seen her
in 20 years.

13:48.694 --> 13:50.218
Well, where is my daughter?

13:50.296 --> 13:52.594
We're gonna find her.
First, we gotta
get you out of here.

13:53.532 --> 13:56.592
Leave that alone.
Give it to me now.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.966
This is a picture of Face.

13:58.037 --> 13:59.971
A.J.: Would you give it to me?
It's none of your business.

14:00.039 --> 14:01.336
What are you doing
with Face's picture?

14:01.407 --> 14:02.533
I told you it was
none of your business.

14:02.608 --> 14:04.166
No, but it's
Face's business.

14:04.243 --> 14:06.040
You wouldn't understand.

14:06.111 --> 14:07.408
Enlighten me.

14:11.016 --> 14:14.110
Templeton Peck is my son.

14:20.426 --> 14:23.361
So, you tell me.
What makes you think
Face is your son?

14:23.429 --> 14:27.365
Contrary to popular belief,
A.J. Bancroft's life

14:27.433 --> 14:30.630
did not begin with his
first corporate merger.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.831
Long before that
there was another life.

14:33.906 --> 14:38.570
I married very young
to my college sweetheart,
Samantha.

14:38.644 --> 14:41.545
The marriage was
not really my idea.

14:41.614 --> 14:42.979
You mean it was Face.

14:43.048 --> 14:47.280
As it turned out,
we named him Richard,
after my father.

14:47.453 --> 14:51.184
Things began to fall apart
almost immediately.

14:51.257 --> 14:55.421
I tried my best, but l
couldn't support a family.

14:56.362 --> 14:57.522
So...

14:58.898 --> 15:02.390
So you ran out on them,
right? That's something
you do real well.

15:02.468 --> 15:05.494
I went to New York and got
a job in the Stock Exchange.

15:05.571 --> 15:09.735
And in no time I was making
a profit and hiring
runners to work for me.

15:09.842 --> 15:13.300
I remarried and had Ellen,
and I tried to forget my past,

15:13.445 --> 15:15.709
but I couldn't forget my boy.

15:15.781 --> 15:20.275
I couldn't find his mother,
Samantha, and eventually,
I went back to find him.

15:20.352 --> 15:24.049
Well, if this is true,
that means Ellen
is his half-sister.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.353
He's got a family.
I should tell him this.

15:26.425 --> 15:29.553
No, you can't tell them yet.
You let me handle this.

15:29.628 --> 15:33.359
No, I don't think so,
Mr. Bancroft. You had 30 years
to tell him and you blew it.

15:33.432 --> 15:37.994
I had my reasons.
I protected my interests
and that was wrong.

15:38.137 --> 15:42.733
But things are different now.
I came back now
to be with my family.

15:42.841 --> 15:44.274
Look at me!

15:45.144 --> 15:48.739
Murdock, I'm dying.

15:50.482 --> 15:53.713
I may never see
another Thanksgiving.

15:54.053 --> 15:57.284
I had to come back
before that.

15:57.489 --> 16:00.947
Which makes it all the more
important that he knows now.

16:01.260 --> 16:03.228
But for God's sake,
let me do it.

16:04.096 --> 16:06.530
24 hours. That's all I ask.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.165
Please?

16:10.302 --> 16:14.568
Consider this a last request.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.900
EVELYN: Let me go.
Please, let me go!

16:19.912 --> 16:24.076
This is Evelyn Bronson,
delivery girl for the mob.

16:25.284 --> 16:27.752
Look, I told you,
I didn't know
what was in the purse.

16:28.120 --> 16:32.284
She claims that somebody paid
her five grand to set you up

33:03.848 --> 33:06.976
And you can't imagine
what it's like to have
to leave the ones you love.

33:07.452 --> 33:08.851
For whatever reasons.

33:10.788 --> 33:13.188
No doubt about who's side
you're on, is there?

33:13.524 --> 33:17.688
This isn't a game.
There are no sides here.
You know, l...

33:20.431 --> 33:25.368
I'll tell you,
if that was my father
back in that cabin,

33:25.970 --> 33:28.495
I'd want to find out
everything I could
about him.

33:33.311 --> 33:35.438
You never knew your father,
did you, Face?

33:36.814 --> 33:37.803
No.

33:39.650 --> 33:42.619
Well, I read about mine
every week in the papers.

33:43.254 --> 33:45.222
Maybe you're better
off not knowing.

33:45.323 --> 33:46.312
Maybe.

33:47.225 --> 33:50.524
And, on the other hand,
maybe you should forget what
you've read about your father

33:50.595 --> 33:52.222
and go in there and
find out for yourself.

33:52.430 --> 33:54.159
You see,
that's the difference
between you and me.

33:54.232 --> 33:57.133
You have the opportunity
to find out, I can only

33:58.669 --> 34:02.435
wonder about who or
what my father was.

34:03.241 --> 34:06.005
What if you didn't like
what you found out?

34:06.277 --> 34:08.643
Doesn't matter.
The bottom line is
that I'd know.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.840
And if l
never saw him again,

34:10.915 --> 34:13.850
if the whole thing ended
the next day, then at least

34:13.918 --> 34:15.647
I'd have a memory.

34:16.888 --> 34:17.877
You know,

34:18.656 --> 34:20.418
I don't...

34:20.491 --> 34:24.655
I don't think you're afraid
of finding out that you're
right about your father.

34:24.762 --> 34:27.253
I think you're afraid of
finding out that you're wrong.

34:28.565 --> 34:30.966
You're afraid that
you'll love him.

34:34.138 --> 34:36.231
I'll be all right.

34:55.793 --> 34:58.489
I'm sorry I ran out on you.

35:05.803 --> 35:08.670
Must run in the family.

35:13.911 --> 35:17.074
STOCKWELL ON PHONE:
That seems to come under the
heading of a personal request.

35:17.148 --> 35:18.445
Not something
I normally honor.

35:18.516 --> 35:21.349
A.J. specifically
requested us. You must've
been aware of that.

35:21.419 --> 35:23.284
I know as much as you do.

35:23.488 --> 35:25.888
That A.J. says
he is Face's father.

35:25.957 --> 35:29.552
Whether he is or is not
is of no concern to me
or your mission.

35:29.627 --> 35:33.063
Now, I see no need
to use my resources
to confirm his genealogy.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.155
Is that understood?

35:34.232 --> 35:37.759
I'm a lot closer to that
precious diary of yours
than you are, General.

35:37.835 --> 35:39.097
Need I say more?

35:39.871 --> 35:43.398
All right, very well,
I'll find out
what you need to know.

35:43.474 --> 35:47.103
In the meantime,
concentrate on the mission.

35:53.251 --> 35:55.242
FACE: How's Erica
and the hamster?

35:55.353 --> 35:58.322
Oh, fine, fine. Here,
let me take one of those.

36:00.691 --> 36:02.022
Murdock, you know something?

36:02.560 --> 36:05.120
I think this is gonna be
a good Thanksgiving after all.

36:05.196 --> 36:06.629
Good, good.

36:06.697 --> 36:09.325
And after it's over,
I'm gonna ask Ellen out.

36:09.400 --> 36:14.303
Oh, that's a stupid idea.
Ellen is not your type.

36:14.405 --> 36:18.535
Murdock, I never met
anybody I was so completely,
you know, at ease with.

36:18.609 --> 36:20.634
It's weird,
I can't explain it.

36:21.112 --> 36:23.580
No, no.
She's definitely my type.

36:23.781 --> 36:26.011
Other women are your type.

36:26.617 --> 36:29.916
Murdock, you wouldn't
happen to have your own,

36:29.987 --> 36:33.650
shall we say, designs
on Ellen, would you?

36:35.026 --> 36:38.757
Yeah. Yeah, we plan to get
involved as soon as we can.

36:39.096 --> 36:40.825
Murdock, you're
a terrible liar.

36:40.898 --> 36:42.331
I know I'm...

36:42.400 --> 36:47.360
(STAMMERlNG) You see, you're
not privy to the whole thing.

36:48.072 --> 36:51.439
There are things here
that you should know that
you don't know, and I'm...

36:53.211 --> 36:54.337
There they are.

37:03.588 --> 37:05.556
Go get them! Get them!

37:22.473 --> 37:23.633
Johnny!

37:23.941 --> 37:27.502
Johnny, Face and Murdock
are coming up the road.

37:27.578 --> 37:29.478
DlSHPAN: Looks like
they're in a hurry.

37:36.320 --> 37:40.450
Guys, we better move,
we just ran into Owens
and his men back in town.

37:40.524 --> 37:43.288
Ellen, you better
get your father,
we gotta move, okay?

37:45.630 --> 37:46.722
He's dead.

37:47.932 --> 37:48.990
What?

37:49.066 --> 37:52.661
That's why he decided to
see me now. He was dying.

38:13.891 --> 38:15.324
My father.

38:16.927 --> 38:19.122
A man I never understood,

38:20.498 --> 38:23.296
and didn't want to
until it was too late.

38:26.504 --> 38:27.937
Goodbye.

38:34.045 --> 38:35.945
I hope she's gonna be okay.

38:36.747 --> 38:39.545
Bet Stockwell knew
A.J. was dying.

38:40.518 --> 38:43.612
I'm sure he did,
but it doesn't matter now.

38:55.533 --> 38:57.967
You ran out on him again.

38:58.035 --> 38:59.900
At least you were consistent.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.305
Well, I'll go tell him.

39:12.083 --> 39:16.520
Okay, listen up. They came
in here yesterday and rented
a cabin off the l-10.

39:16.587 --> 39:18.214
Now, this is our last chance.

39:18.289 --> 39:22.123
Either we bury these
people or we can forget
about going home. Follow us.

39:28.132 --> 39:29.292
Let's go.

39:33.504 --> 39:34.937
What kind of a friend are you?

39:35.005 --> 39:36.563
Look, it still
might not be true.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.301
It's possible that
he isn't your father.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.742
Yeah, and it's possible he is.

39:40.811 --> 39:44.406
Why didn't you tell me,
Murdock? Why? Why did
you hide it from me?

39:44.482 --> 39:46.848
Because A.J. begged
me not to tell you.

39:46.917 --> 39:49.943
And, I said okay,
but if he didn't tell you,
then I would.

39:50.020 --> 39:53.581
I see, so you tell me
now, after he's dead.
Well, your timing stinks.

39:53.657 --> 39:56.956
Well, he was dying!
What do you want me to do?

39:57.228 --> 39:58.593
It was a last request!

39:58.662 --> 40:03.224
Well, I see.
Well, it's nice to know
where your loyalties are.

40:03.300 --> 40:06.963
Who else have you told, huh?
Hannibal, B.A., Frankie,
the newspaper boy?

40:07.037 --> 40:09.699
No, no, no, just
you, me and...

40:10.441 --> 40:11.738
Stockwell knows.

40:11.842 --> 40:16.472
Stockwell? You told
Stockwell about my father,
but you can't tell me?

40:16.847 --> 40:19.645
I swear, you know,
I don't understand
what motivates you.

40:19.884 --> 40:24.150
And you know something?
You were always the one that
I thought I could count on.

40:24.221 --> 40:26.416
Well, you still
can count on me.
Oh, really?

40:26.524 --> 40:28.355
And because of you I may
have lost the only chance

40:28.426 --> 40:30.326
I'll ever have to find out
who my father was, huh?

40:30.394 --> 40:32.089
Did you think
it wasn't important?

40:32.163 --> 40:33.357
Face, that's not...
Leave me alone.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.922
Listen, there's
more to the story...
I said leave me alone!

40:42.440 --> 40:44.203
Good. Good. Good. Good.

40:44.742 --> 40:46.437
You're perfectly clear
about that.

40:47.077 --> 40:48.772
But let me tell you one thing.

40:49.313 --> 40:51.781
You remember when
I was in the van and you
caught me on the phone?

40:52.116 --> 40:55.483
And I told you I was
talking to Erica and then
I asked for your advice.

40:55.553 --> 40:59.319
I said somebody had
come to me and they told
me something about Erica,

40:59.390 --> 41:01.449
but they begged me
not to tell her about it.

41:01.525 --> 41:04.085
I said, "What should
I do?" You said,
"Trust your gut instinct."

41:04.161 --> 41:07.460
Well, it wasn't Erica
I was talking about.
It was you.

41:07.665 --> 41:12.261
And you were wrong!
And let me tell you this.
If A.J. had not died

41:12.403 --> 41:16.567
and if he had had the
opportunity to tell you,
right now, here, by this tree,

41:16.640 --> 41:20.508
you would be thanking me
for holding back and
not telling.

41:20.945 --> 41:22.936
Murdock.
No, don't say anything!

41:25.649 --> 41:27.810
One thing about you and me
I've always liked,

41:28.819 --> 41:30.013
that's our fights.

41:30.554 --> 41:35.514
'Cause we don't have
to stumble over
our lips apologizing.

Here they come.

First take, everybody.

41:58.682 --> 42:02.641
All right, Bancroft,
you got one minute before
we start leveling this place.

Howdy, fellas.

42:13.330 --> 42:15.491
Thanksgiving dinner
isn't till 4:00.

42:15.566 --> 42:18.000
Cut it, Smith.
I want Bancroft.

42:18.435 --> 42:20.903
I don't give a rat's brain
about you or your men.

42:20.971 --> 42:24.372
Oh, seeing as you
got a rat's brain,
I'm tempted to believe you.

42:24.575 --> 42:28.511
We've got the firepower
that says we don't believe
in dying for him.

42:29.446 --> 42:32.381
You want him?
You got him.

42:45.429 --> 42:46.691
It's a dummy.

43:19.863 --> 43:21.558

one weasel

belongs to Ellen.

and hearings on the part
of this panel

reasonable obstructions
to his appointment.

Therefore, if there is
no further debate...

address the committee.

All right, Miss Bancroft,
now tell me what you have
in mind, but be brief.

44:51.422 --> 44:56.223
You all know my father
was a criminal.
A fugitive from justice.

44:56.427 --> 44:58.622
He died Thanksgiving morning,

44:58.796 --> 45:00.696
but not before
giving me his diary.

I think that these pages
will be of interest to you.

father's association
with Jacob Edwards.
