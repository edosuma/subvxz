03:08.824 --> 03:10.377
Ada?

03:13.762 --> 03:14.962
Come on!

03:15.863 --> 03:17.563
Come over here!

03:21.341 --> 03:22.859
- Get off me!
- Why?

03:22.859 --> 03:24.806
- 'Cause I said!
- Ain't anybody else gonna see.

03:24.906 --> 03:26.216
Not here!

03:26.700 --> 03:28.857
But I'm already hard.

03:29.257 --> 03:30.512
Come on!

03:30.612 --> 03:32.415
No! I said no!

03:34.022 --> 03:35.246
Fine.

03:37.470 --> 03:39.919
Why is your skin so hot, anyway?

03:39.932 --> 03:42.485
- Better go finish up the still.
- Wait.

03:45.829 --> 03:48.229
I ain't got time for games.

03:50.323 --> 03:52.040
Back there, then.

03:52.677 --> 03:54.190
You sure?

03:55.923 --> 03:58.273
Yeah. Come on.

05:26.325 --> 05:28.910
I swear your skin feels different.

05:30.608 --> 05:31.738
Really?

05:31.838 --> 05:35.724
Well, it ain't.
Just drop it already.

05:45.202 --> 05:47.891
Ada?
You come here.

06:00.070 --> 06:02.068
Now, Bodey got something to tell you.

06:03.269 --> 06:05.242
We're gonna be joined.

06:05.472 --> 06:08.835
Well... When?

06:09.013 --> 06:10.764
Next full moon, it'll happen.

06:10.764 --> 06:12.140
If she's been true.

06:13.954 --> 06:15.543
Got the papers?

06:32.771 --> 06:34.711
May I go to the pit?

06:35.345 --> 06:36.840
I'd like to pray on this.

06:37.324 --> 06:38.909
Best go with her.

06:40.630 --> 06:42.121
I... I'll go later.

06:42.421 --> 06:45.480
Tell everyone to come
on for dinner after you've finished.

08:48.944 --> 08:49.831
Dawai?

08:49.831 --> 08:51.098
What?!

08:52.542 --> 08:55.148
Ow! Shit fire!

08:55.248 --> 08:56.688
What you doing?

08:59.988 --> 09:01.441
Nothing.

09:07.428 --> 09:10.367
The candles need lighting.

09:11.267 --> 09:13.484
You're supposed to come
on for dinner.

09:14.981 --> 09:18.137
Oh, is something...
something good happening?

09:18.288 --> 09:21.222
Bodey asked pa for us to be joined.

09:23.321 --> 09:24.850
Well, that's...

09:25.152 --> 09:27.182
...that is good news.

09:28.824 --> 09:33.117
Bodey?
He'll do right by you

09:35.042 --> 09:37.220
Want to listen to some music?

09:37.563 --> 09:39.276
I'll play you your favorite.

09:39.500 --> 09:43.376
Can't. Got to tell everyone
before it gets late.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.452
Tomorrow?

09:47.698 --> 09:49.389
Yeah, tomorrow, then.

09:49.499 --> 09:52.428
So, you'll come... for dinner?

09:52.800 --> 09:54.890
I don't know.
I... I got...

09:55.500 --> 09:58.343
I got things need tending to.

09:58.939 --> 10:00.139
So...

10:00.349 --> 10:02.392
I hope you do.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.800
You get to everyone?

11:33.100 --> 11:34.318
Yep.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.011
Anyone say they ain't coming?

11:38.011 --> 11:40.593
Dawai's the only one
that seemed to be on the fence.

11:40.750 --> 11:42.299
Figures.

11:42.699 --> 11:46.181
You ain't spending no more time
down there, anyway.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.217
I'll do what i want.

11:48.300 --> 11:51.742
You will do what Bodey tells you to!

11:52.012 --> 11:56.156
Now that's the way it is.
You best get used to it!

11:56.856 --> 11:58.633
Whatever.

11:59.144 --> 12:01.725
You got something you want to say?

12:02.523 --> 12:04.977
Oh, I'm just all up in knots is it.

12:05.121 --> 12:06.521
Oh!

12:08.300 --> 12:10.160
You're dripping, then?

12:11.610 --> 12:13.803
Come a little late, though, ain't it?

12:14.700 --> 12:15.922
Let me see.

12:15.922 --> 12:17.288
Why? It's gross.

12:17.288 --> 12:18.878
Come on, Ada!

12:52.123 --> 12:53.996
You got that 'shine ready?

12:54.223 --> 12:55.728
What's going on?

12:56.300 --> 12:58.298
We got people coming over.

12:59.200 --> 13:02.471
Bodey asked to be joined to your sister.

13:05.026 --> 13:06.726
About time.

13:15.024 --> 13:16.700
I want to, uh...

13:18.400 --> 13:20.400
I want to thank you all for coming.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.652
Today...

13:23.400 --> 13:29.138
I give away my only daughter
to be joined to Bodey Jenkin...

13:30.814 --> 13:34.088
To continue in the ways
that we hold sacred.

13:34.800 --> 13:39.579
And I thank the pit
with all my heart for making it so.

13:41.400 --> 13:45.253
I raise this jug of 'shine

13:46.100 --> 13:48.772
For all to taste who believe.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.559
I'd like to say something.

14:08.400 --> 14:12.176
Bodey, you're getting a good one.
I can tell you that.

14:15.700 --> 14:17.744
Wish you all the best.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.285
Eat up, all.

15:12.700 --> 15:13.710
No!

15:13.800 --> 15:15.499
Do you need any help?

15:16.200 --> 15:19.921
Just this little redheaded one.
He's biter! No biting!

15:20.130 --> 15:23.168
No biting!
Don't bite!

15:26.800 --> 15:28.435
There we go.

15:29.400 --> 15:32.107
- They're meaner than they look.
- Yeah, I'll bet.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.083
Shit!

15:37.800 --> 15:39.145
Shit?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.473
Well, Jessaby.

15:43.944 --> 15:46.840
- You must be real happy.
- Shut the fuck up, you retard.

15:46.940 --> 15:48.120
Jessaby!

15:48.500 --> 15:51.057
I want to talk to my sis alone.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.819
All right.

15:58.900 --> 15:59.957
Don't!

15:59.957 --> 16:01.080
Don't what?

16:01.180 --> 16:02.880
You keep your mouth shut.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.928
I know.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.287
They're gonna test you,

16:07.700 --> 16:10.496
And you better blame it on
somebody else. I don't care who.

16:10.620 --> 16:13.120
I ain't letting Bodey take after
pa 'cause of this, you hear?

16:13.320 --> 16:14.939
We'll talk about it later.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.383
No, we won't.

16:18.630 --> 16:20.132
You're on your own.

16:30.755 --> 16:33.700
You and Sustin's all happy now, but

16:34.000 --> 16:37.511
If she'd been fooling around,
you're gonna have to pay up.

16:39.523 --> 16:42.600
Well, don't you worry your pretty,
little head about it.

16:43.023 --> 16:45.371
She was dripping today.

16:46.700 --> 16:48.986
Just means she ain't been caught.

16:50.139 --> 16:53.150
She'll pass.
Now leave it alone.

16:53.210 --> 16:55.189
Was your brother sad?

16:55.740 --> 16:57.220
About what?

16:58.100 --> 17:01.071
He'll be asking someone
to join him soon, won't he?

17:02.215 --> 17:04.789
Want me to mention you to him?

17:05.646 --> 17:07.035
Could you?

17:07.319 --> 17:09.311
Take your grandpa a plate.

17:09.544 --> 17:10.887
It's cold.

17:11.224 --> 17:13.281
Yeah, well, it'll have to do.

17:14.270 --> 17:16.074
It's nasty, though.

17:16.210 --> 17:18.329
He won't complain.

17:21.715 --> 17:25.402
What was your brother
all tore up about earlier?

17:25.646 --> 17:29.729
He's just being his ass self,
as usual.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.111
He don't care for Bodey?

17:33.303 --> 17:37.456
He... he just don't want him
horning in on things is all.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.146
Like what?

17:40.125 --> 17:41.825
I don't know.

17:41.925 --> 17:44.009
He wasn't making much sense.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.120
Grandpa?

18:04.320 --> 18:06.297
I got you some food.

18:11.425 --> 18:12.749
Grandpa?

18:14.520 --> 18:16.349
You've been sleeping?

18:16.649 --> 18:18.344
Mm-hmm.

18:18.444 --> 18:19.904
Yeah.

18:21.072 --> 18:22.659
Are you hungry?

18:24.528 --> 18:26.454
I thought so.

18:27.612 --> 18:29.420
Let's get you some air.

18:29.520 --> 18:32.422
Either you're getting fat,
or I'm getting weaker.

18:55.378 --> 18:58.548
We had everyone over
to dinner tonight.

19:04.528 --> 19:07.152
Bodey and I are gonna be joined.

19:08.620 --> 19:11.108
I should have seen
it coming already.

19:12.640 --> 19:15.048
Not like there's anybody else
could have asked.

19:18.744 --> 19:21.821
I know who the next jug face is.

19:25.230 --> 19:26.663
It's me.

19:29.829 --> 19:31.503
It's mine.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.382
I don't even know why i told you.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.110
Not like you can help.

20:44.378 --> 20:46.102
Here we go.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.356
What's wrong with you?

20:58.779 --> 21:00.729
Has anyone ever said no?

21:00.829 --> 21:01.992
About what?

21:03.323 --> 21:04.931
Being joined?

21:05.520 --> 21:07.523
Is that why you're so quiet?

21:08.444 --> 21:11.254
It's a woman's job to have babies.

21:12.300 --> 21:14.362
You got to be joined to do that.

21:14.700 --> 21:16.824
Is that all I'm good for?

21:16.904 --> 21:18.815
It's an amazing thing,
bearing babies...

21:18.935 --> 21:21.198
something no man will ever get to do.

21:21.298 --> 21:23.577
Once Bodey gives you a little one,

21:24.144 --> 21:26.383
You'll be beside yourself.
You'll see.

21:26.700 --> 21:28.361
What if I can't?

21:29.342 --> 21:32.218
Pit will make it right.
It always does.

21:34.468 --> 21:36.762
Has the pit ever taken a baby?

21:38.200 --> 21:40.316
Yeah, sure has.

21:40.679 --> 21:42.790
Gonna check on that possum.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.203
Yeah, that's what.

22:15.200 --> 22:18.039
All right.
Now don't speak to nobody.

22:18.066 --> 22:20.417
Just get what you need,
and that's it, right?

22:25.300 --> 22:26.900
Morning, Sustin.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.274
What you got?

22:37.411 --> 22:40.877
I got half peach, half apple.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.414
They're both hot sellers right now,
I'm telling you.

22:46.427 --> 22:48.800
Can't help you with
that possum, though.

22:50.728 --> 22:52.628
That ain't for sale.

23:07.550 --> 23:11.266
All right. Thank you so much
for coming in. You have a good day.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.520
You finding everything all right?

23:50.550 --> 23:51.901
Yeah.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.662
Let me know if you need any help.

24:18.100 --> 24:19.749
Do any good?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.365
Pack of three.

24:23.588 --> 24:25.832
Make them last.

24:48.780 --> 24:50.621
Don't forget the laundry.

24:50.722 --> 24:51.834
I know!

24:59.300 --> 25:01.300
Must be nice...

25:02.600 --> 25:05.128
To know who you'll be with, finally.

25:06.185 --> 25:08.230
Oh, right.

25:09.238 --> 25:11.862
All that he talks about is you now.

25:12.500 --> 25:13.929
Is that so?

25:14.500 --> 25:16.507
How many kids you think you'll have?

25:18.000 --> 25:21.303
Mama says we need five or six to
keep things going real good.

25:21.403 --> 25:23.952
We'll have as many as the pit wants,
I reckon.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.677
It's right.

26:29.500 --> 26:30.993
Ada?

26:31.600 --> 26:33.670
Eilen.

26:35.300 --> 26:36.827
Run.

26:54.499 --> 26:56.216
Eilen!

26:56.600 --> 26:57.694
Oh, god!

26:57.848 --> 27:02.768
Eilen?! Where's Eilen?!
Where is she?! Eilen?

27:10.000 --> 27:11.761
Eilen?

27:14.300 --> 27:17.230
Oh, no!

28:18.500 --> 28:20.630
Dawai said nothing?

28:22.000 --> 28:23.835
Not to me.

28:24.750 --> 28:26.018
Hey...

28:26.799 --> 28:28.971
You're down there all the time.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.203
You seen him making one?

28:33.400 --> 28:34.501
No.

28:34.724 --> 28:36.915
Just his normal stuff.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.462
I ain't make no jug face.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.146
I swear.

28:44.500 --> 28:46.980
The pit ain't spoken to you at all?

28:49.000 --> 28:50.385
No.

28:57.400 --> 29:00.815
Have all the families
meet at the house at dark.

29:19.416 --> 29:21.595
I'm sure you all know that

29:22.000 --> 29:25.527
Eilen Jenkin was...
was taken today.

29:25.627 --> 29:27.118
Where's the jug face?

29:27.499 --> 29:29.111
Dawai, do you swear

29:29.212 --> 29:32.630
That the pit did not guide you
hand to make a new jug face?

29:33.000 --> 29:37.441
Well, when it does,
I don't know that it did or not.

29:37.541 --> 29:39.407
I just wake up feeling funny.

29:39.687 --> 29:42.132
And I did feel funny yesterday.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.928
But I didn't fire nothing.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.681
All right, now... now Dawai is gonna
search his place again,

29:49.100 --> 29:52.603
And if he does not find a jug face,
well, then, we wait.

29:53.200 --> 29:56.308
We wait until the pit guides
its hand to make another.

29:56.408 --> 29:59.750
My daughter's gonna roam these woods,
shunned forever.

29:59.950 --> 30:03.709
Who knows how many others will be taken
'cause of this idiot?

30:05.920 --> 30:07.370
Where are you?!

30:27.000 --> 30:28.893
Tell me where it is!

30:29.000 --> 30:31.155
Please! I'm begging you!

30:31.363 --> 30:33.672
Just tell me where it is!

30:44.000 --> 30:45.649
I'm gonna do it.

30:47.500 --> 30:51.795
I'm gonna do it!
I swear I'll do it if you don't tell me.

30:54.500 --> 30:57.011
- What?
- It's me

31:04.000 --> 31:05.327
All right!

31:12.500 --> 31:14.428
Come on check on you.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.659
I want to be alone.

31:19.163 --> 31:20.883
Thought you hated 'shine.

31:22.500 --> 31:23.730
I do.

31:24.200 --> 31:25.734
You found it yet?

31:27.170 --> 31:29.690
It's got to be around
here somewhere, right?

31:29.826 --> 31:31.136
Don't!!

31:35.900 --> 31:38.890
I might have left my knife in there.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.913
Let me do something with this.

32:04.300 --> 32:05.867
What is that?

32:06.300 --> 32:07.570
What?

32:08.500 --> 32:09.841
It's a...

32:10.218 --> 32:12.488
Never noticed it before.

32:13.152 --> 32:15.764
I didn't...
I didn't really want you to see that.

32:16.124 --> 32:18.800
Thought we swore
we'd never have secrets.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.403
Yeah, right, we didn't,
but i... please, don't! Please!

32:28.300 --> 32:30.649
When did you make this?

32:31.500 --> 32:36.700
Couple weeks back. I ain't nobody
'cause ain't nobody got a baby right now.

32:36.800 --> 32:39.517
You think it means something?

32:42.700 --> 32:44.980
I don't really know.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.433
You think that's what the pit wants?

32:53.894 --> 32:56.728
There ain't no baby, so how could it?

32:58.520 --> 33:02.571
Right. That's... that's what I come to.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.149
Makes my head hurt.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.581
If I were you,

33:28.300 --> 33:31.267
I'd think on it real hard,

33:32.300 --> 33:36.312
And maybe you'll see the face
again that it showed you.

33:41.100 --> 33:43.389
What if a face I see

33:44.400 --> 33:46.725
Ain't the right one?

33:50.100 --> 33:52.981
Never been wrong before, have you?

34:02.200 --> 34:04.132
Come in here.

34:11.699 --> 34:13.733
Where you been?

34:14.257 --> 34:15.928
I was out, walking.

34:16.755 --> 34:18.590
Where's pa?

34:21.400 --> 34:24.100
He's over at the Jenkins'.

34:27.780 --> 34:32.897
I don't think you'd be too scared out
there in them woods yourself.

34:33.199 --> 34:35.270
Must have been an awful sight.

34:35.280 --> 34:36.610
It was.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.739
I'm gonna go to bed.

34:43.235 --> 34:45.955
- I ain't done with you.
- What?

34:46.500 --> 34:48.960
Go in the bathroom.

34:49.070 --> 34:51.701
- No!
- Go, go!

34:53.284 --> 34:55.569
- I want to see.
- See what?

34:56.168 --> 35:00.143
I want to see if you've been fooling
around, Before you shame all of us

35:00.343 --> 35:03.170
- Now drop your drawers.
- I'm fine.

35:03.400 --> 35:04.700
I swear!

35:04.920 --> 35:07.665
Get them off and sit your butt down.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.975
Go on. Open up.

35:19.300 --> 35:20.928
Open up.

35:22.600 --> 35:24.940
Do you want me to burn you?

35:26.300 --> 35:30.635
- All righty.
- Stop! Stop!

35:31.700 --> 35:35.165
Now you do as I say.
I ain't kidding around here!

35:36.700 --> 35:38.390
Further!

35:50.000 --> 35:53.659
- You little slut.
- No, I'm not. I'm not. I swear!

35:53.759 --> 35:57.182
- Who is it?
- It ain't nobody! I swear! I swear it ain't nobody!

35:57.282 --> 35:59.426
- Get on the floor!
- Mama please!

35:59.526 --> 36:02.780
- Give me your hand.
- Please, no, no, mama!

36:04.400 --> 36:05.885
Now tell me who it is!

36:05.985 --> 36:10.422
I was just playing with myself.
I swear! I swear! I swear!

36:10.522 --> 36:14.190
I swear on the pit! I swear on the pit!
I promise! I promise!

36:14.290 --> 36:15.956
- It ain't dawai?
- No!

36:20.000 --> 36:22.890
Well, I hope you're right.
I surely do.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.890
Clean yourself up.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.540
Hey, darlin'?

36:42.800 --> 36:44.417
What?

36:44.600 --> 36:46.155
Come on. Roll over.

36:48.550 --> 36:50.429
She tell you?

36:50.782 --> 36:52.211
She did.

36:52.890 --> 36:54.352
I believe you.

36:57.800 --> 37:00.219
Oh, let me see your hand.

37:01.800 --> 37:04.047
She shouldn't have done that.

37:04.800 --> 37:08.410
You know, this is all gonna be over,

37:08.510 --> 37:11.867
and you're gonna be on your way
to a happy life with Bodey.

37:12.200 --> 37:13.713
What's wrong with her?

37:14.600 --> 37:17.129
Nothing. She's fine.

37:33.641 --> 37:36.128
Don't worry. You're safe.

37:38.100 --> 37:40.604
Don't even try
to hold this over me.

37:43.400 --> 37:45.652
There is one thing, though.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.618
Go to sleep.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.760
I'm pregnant.

37:53.800 --> 37:58.296
And I know it's true,
'cause I got one of them tests from town.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.598
Let it be know.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.352
No!

39:01.200 --> 39:03.126
He's all we got!

39:07.600 --> 39:09.819
Sustin, please.

39:10.129 --> 39:11.795
The pit has spoken.

39:13.356 --> 39:17.488
It is an honor to be chosen to be
with it in this world... you know that...

39:17.678 --> 39:24.045
For without the blood,
the waters of the pit would heal no one.

39:24.245 --> 39:26.665
And so, we do what we must.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.223
Bodey...

39:31.500 --> 39:33.927
Go on, son.

39:40.400 --> 39:42.131
Bodey Jenkin...

39:43.600 --> 39:44.958
Today...

39:45.700 --> 39:51.059
You will pass from this would into its.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.972
Do you give yourself to it?

39:56.700 --> 39:58.294
Yes.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.670
Mama...

40:11.770 --> 40:15.757
It's okay, baby.

40:47.708 --> 40:52.112
Go now with your hearts beating strong

40:52.900 --> 40:56.872
And know that our pact continues.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.676
Grandpa!

41:10.000 --> 41:11.336
Oh!

41:18.800 --> 41:21.162
How long you been like this?

41:23.000 --> 41:24.960
Are you finished?

41:32.330 --> 41:37.659
One... two... three. Up.

41:40.350 --> 41:42.233
Put your hand up.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.172
Watch your head.

42:24.800 --> 42:27.163
No! What do you want?!

42:27.700 --> 42:29.932
Do you know what I am?

42:30.110 --> 42:32.070
You're one of the shunned.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.559
Then, you know you must stop.

42:36.750 --> 42:39.375
I don't know what you're talking about.

42:42.995 --> 42:46.095
No! Please don't hurt him!

42:46.400 --> 42:48.495
It is he who hurt me.

42:49.900 --> 42:53.223
He hid a jug face, same as you.

42:54.575 --> 42:56.832
I forgave, but...

42:57.000 --> 42:58.789
They did not.

42:59.325 --> 43:02.185
They won't forgive you, either.

43:02.500 --> 43:05.006
They did this to Coops?

43:05.420 --> 43:07.700
Poison.

43:09.850 --> 43:12.518
Whose jug face was it?

43:15.300 --> 43:17.482
His wife's.

43:17.700 --> 43:20.321
What if I don't want to die, though?

43:21.500 --> 43:24.420
I have a baby inside me.

43:25.301 --> 43:27.548
You must.

44:25.700 --> 44:27.341
Who's there?

44:32.500 --> 44:36.900
You sure are drinking a lot for
someone who don't have a taste for it.

44:38.400 --> 44:43.590
I don't know what I had against it.
It's treating me... treating me just fine.

44:45.300 --> 44:47.151
You want a sip?

44:49.100 --> 44:51.502
I need to talk to you.

44:54.900 --> 44:57.684
But you ain't up for it, I'm thinking.

44:58.549 --> 45:01.132
Everything's all right.

45:02.456 --> 45:05.358
It turned out just fine, didn't it?

45:05.500 --> 45:06.974
Yeah.

45:31.500 --> 45:33.813
Ada? Ada!

45:38.878 --> 45:40.202
What's wrong?

45:40.302 --> 45:42.153
Is Pa inside?
I don't know.

45:42.253 --> 45:43.687
Can I see?

45:47.960 --> 45:52.214
- Pa, I need to talk with you.
- It'll have to wait. I got to see the Corber.

45:52.332 --> 45:53.748
I'm sick.

45:54.200 --> 45:55.785
What?

45:59.500 --> 46:01.229
How long?

46:01.900 --> 46:04.784
A week, maybe.

46:05.800 --> 46:10.220
- You think the pit will heal me?
- If we ask it, it will.

46:10.350 --> 46:13.388
- What if it's too soon?
- That ain't how it works.

46:13.488 --> 46:15.976
- It could still be mad.
- It ain't.

46:16.126 --> 46:17.928
We give it a life when it wants it,

46:18.028 --> 46:19.507
and it heals us when we need it.

46:19.607 --> 46:22.100
It's been like that
since we first survived the pox.

46:22.100 --> 46:24.420
Now come on. We'll be back.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.754
Strip down...

46:53.989 --> 46:55.763
All the way.

46:56.100 --> 46:58.298
It's gonna work, right?

46:58.428 --> 47:00.329
Don't be scared.

47:00.445 --> 47:02.794
We got to trust in it.

47:18.958 --> 47:22.743
Sit down low.
Get it all over you.

47:25.900 --> 47:27.405
We...

47:29.000 --> 47:31.208
We come to ask for help.

47:32.898 --> 47:35.558
My boy Jessaby is sick,

47:36.740 --> 47:38.603
Ask that you heal him

47:38.808 --> 47:41.762
- So he can serve you better.
- Dawai!

47:42.976 --> 47:45.703
Ow! Help.

47:47.100 --> 47:51.166
And we thank you for all the years
you kept us well, and we pray

47:51.266 --> 47:52.775
to be chosen.

47:54.200 --> 47:56.596
Stand.

47:59.200 --> 48:01.208
I think I feel it.

48:10.200 --> 48:11.546
Pa!

48:12.200 --> 48:14.502
Come on up here.
Come on.

48:27.300 --> 48:29.069
No.

48:41.600 --> 48:43.423
Ada?

48:48.500 --> 48:50.378
You out here?

48:54.400 --> 48:56.453
I thought I heard you.

48:58.970 --> 49:00.716
Ada?

49:02.116 --> 49:03.905
Ada?!

49:14.920 --> 49:16.427
Ada.

49:28.151 --> 49:29.517
Hey.

49:42.800 --> 49:44.493
You all right?

49:44.700 --> 49:47.221
Jessaby's been taken.

49:48.500 --> 49:50.309
It's all my fault.

49:50.700 --> 49:52.595
Loriss?!

50:01.500 --> 50:03.975
- Loriss?!
- What?

50:05.700 --> 50:09.930
What's happening?
I heard the... horn.

50:11.300 --> 50:13.905
Whose blood is that?

50:14.300 --> 50:15.850
Ada didn't tell you?

50:16.100 --> 50:17.833
Tell me what?

50:18.958 --> 50:22.828
Jessaby was sick.
So, we went to the pit.

50:23.488 --> 50:24.760
No.

50:24.860 --> 50:27.165
It ain't never done this before!

50:27.273 --> 50:29.480
The sacrifice didn't take?

50:29.600 --> 50:31.365
Something ain't right.

50:32.300 --> 50:34.561
The pit wants me...

50:35.600 --> 50:37.428
And my baby.

50:37.618 --> 50:39.288
Baby?

50:39.400 --> 50:41.766
You know that jug face you got in there?

50:41.866 --> 50:44.421
I'm pregnant.

50:50.300 --> 50:52.282
There she is.

50:54.300 --> 50:55.830
Dawai?!

50:56.600 --> 50:58.484
What did you do?!

50:58.990 --> 51:00.891
Pa! No!

51:02.260 --> 51:05.257
Pa, no!
Stop hitting him!

51:05.357 --> 51:08.751
Pa, stop it!
Stop hitting him!

51:08.851 --> 51:13.140
Pa, get off him! Please!
Please, stop hitting him!

51:15.400 --> 51:18.256
He's gonna pay for the deaths he caused!

51:19.800 --> 51:23.298
What the fuck did you do?
I... tell us!

51:23.758 --> 51:26.999
I lost it... the jug face.

51:27.240 --> 51:29.301
I looked everywhere. I did.

51:29.412 --> 51:32.136
And then, when I couldn't find it,
uh...

51:32.520 --> 51:36.298
I made another from...

51:37.000 --> 51:39.700
...The person I had in my head.

51:39.800 --> 51:41.656
Motherfucker.

51:41.756 --> 51:45.748
Both my girl and boy
are dead 'cause of you!

51:49.200 --> 51:52.053
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

51:52.153 --> 51:55.110
Get your ass up!
Get up!

52:10.928 --> 52:13.195
Now, because of what dawai has done,

52:13.725 --> 52:16.000
it's only fitting he be next.

52:16.100 --> 52:17.725
Once it takes him,

52:17.825 --> 52:20.406
He'll choose the next Potter.

52:23.700 --> 52:26.135
You got anything to say?

52:26.500 --> 52:28.720
I'm real sorry. I am.

52:30.200 --> 52:32.017
Hope you all know that.

52:32.321 --> 52:35.183
Well, you'll have plenty of
time to think on it,

52:35.323 --> 52:38.180
As you walk these woods forever,

52:38.280 --> 52:41.177
Shunned like those
whose deaths you caused!

52:41.800 --> 52:43.393
I know...

52:44.175 --> 52:46.081
And accept it.

53:10.920 --> 53:12.524
Grandpa...

53:13.400 --> 53:15.218
I got to go.

53:15.700 --> 53:19.809
Now, someone might not come to
check on you for a couple days,

53:19.909 --> 53:22.311
till they figure out what's going on.

53:31.989 --> 53:34.160
I love you.

53:50.400 --> 53:52.443
Dawai?

53:52.643 --> 53:54.577
- Dawai. Shh!... Shh.
- No!

53:55.200 --> 53:57.670
We're leaving now. We got to hurry.

53:57.870 --> 54:01.455
- What? No.
- You want to die?

54:04.200 --> 54:06.262
It doesn't matter.

54:06.600 --> 54:07.954
It's all right.

54:08.054 --> 54:09.718
This will make it stop.

54:09.818 --> 54:12.788
And then you and your baby
will be safe, then.

54:13.300 --> 54:16.400
I ain't gonna have your blood
on my hands, too.

54:19.500 --> 54:21.680
You got any 'shine left?

54:21.780 --> 54:25.394
Uh... Yeah, I got a couple jugs.

54:25.494 --> 54:27.710
Get something to put those in.

54:29.500 --> 54:31.110
Why we need these?

54:31.220 --> 54:35.370
For money, unless you got some stashed
around here nobody knows about.

54:35.600 --> 54:37.456
No.

54:51.400 --> 54:53.093
You think they've noticed?

54:53.389 --> 54:55.322
Probably.

54:58.800 --> 55:00.000
What's wrong?

55:00.200 --> 55:04.180
I just... Get this bad feeling
in the morning.

55:04.280 --> 55:06.365
Oh, right.

55:07.200 --> 55:09.648
Hand me that jug face.

55:09.723 --> 55:12.926
- Well...
- Dawai, give it here.

55:16.210 --> 55:18.842
Nothing's gonna take my baby.

55:25.500 --> 55:28.123
Oh, make him stop.

55:30.221 --> 55:32.612
Make him stop, dawai!

55:38.600 --> 55:42.393
Hello. We need a ride into town?

55:58.500 --> 56:00.067
Can I help y'all?

56:00.167 --> 56:02.754
We need to speak to your pa.

56:03.700 --> 56:06.755
Yeah, sure... one second.

56:11.400 --> 56:13.210
Can I help you?

56:13.510 --> 56:16.010
We got something for you.

56:23.410 --> 56:25.040
We got you some more 'shine.

56:25.140 --> 56:27.231
Y'all ain't supposed to be here
till next month.

56:27.331 --> 56:30.568
Yeah, but this is special.
Look. Show him.

56:31.700 --> 56:33.750
Smells the same.

56:34.500 --> 56:37.733
It's real strong! Head peeler!

56:37.833 --> 56:39.926
I don't think so.

56:40.200 --> 56:41.381
Look.

56:41.481 --> 56:45.057
I think we're gonna need to stick
to our original agreement, all right?

56:45.057 --> 56:47.518
- I'm gonna have to pass on this, okay?
- No, wait!

56:50.300 --> 56:52.655
Look. I'm real sick.

56:53.212 --> 56:56.670
We need the money
so I can see a doctor.

56:57.200 --> 56:59.606
My pa, he don't believe in them.

57:01.306 --> 57:04.802
I'm scared. Please!

57:07.500 --> 57:10.350
- All right.
- Oh, thank you, thank you!

57:10.450 --> 57:13.637
Y'all wait right here,
and I'll get you some money, okay?

57:13.777 --> 57:16.217
Y'all thirsty?
You want something to drink?

57:16.317 --> 57:18.538
Yeah, that'd be good,
thank you.

57:27.500 --> 57:30.542
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

57:30.925 --> 57:32.972
He sure is out.

57:34.700 --> 57:37.182
He's been through a lot.

57:38.100 --> 57:41.920
If there's anything else you need,
let me know.

57:44.210 --> 57:47.418
I don't mean to pry, but
my dad said you need a doctor.

57:47.518 --> 57:49.172
I know where there's an ob/gyn.

57:49.272 --> 57:51.344
- Hmm?
- A baby doctor.

57:51.444 --> 57:54.985
I saw you with the pregnancy tests
the other day.

57:55.180 --> 57:58.027
No, no, no, I'm not.

57:58.589 --> 58:01.319
I'm sorry. I just assumed.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.724
You okay?

58:23.993 --> 58:25.852
- Help me!
- What?

58:25.852 --> 58:28.589
I don't know.
I think she's having a seizure.

58:34.789 --> 58:37.983
- She needs a doctor.
- No doctors.

58:38.185 --> 58:40.752
No, no,
I'm fine. I'm fine.

58:42.810 --> 58:44.958
Please don't tell your pa.

58:44.968 --> 58:47.618
- You need help.
- The people where we're from...

58:47.718 --> 58:49.262
...they want to hurt us.

58:49.362 --> 58:51.401
She's telling you the truth.

58:52.678 --> 58:55.130
I'll make sure you
get your money, then.

59:05.372 --> 59:07.393
What'd it show you?

59:08.302 --> 59:10.387
It took Pyer.

59:13.200 --> 59:16.410
Then, you do see
through its eyes.

59:20.158 --> 59:22.540
It's punishing me.

59:23.510 --> 59:25.283
Who was that?

59:25.383 --> 59:26.950
How they doing back there?

59:27.054 --> 59:28.812
We have to help them.

59:28.912 --> 59:31.750
You can't get in the middle of
these people.

59:31.950 --> 59:34.940
There's some weird shit going on
in the woods out there,

59:35.140 --> 59:37.683
and we don't want any part of it.
You understand?

59:41.240 --> 59:43.100
Just rest yourself.

59:43.400 --> 59:45.960
It ain't no good for you to be wound up like you are.

59:46.160 --> 59:47.868
This is taking too long.

59:48.880 --> 59:51.273
Well, they said they'd bring the money.

59:52.100 --> 59:53.220
Let's go.

59:53.320 --> 59:54.604
We'll try somewhere else.

59:54.704 --> 59:56.544
Get up! Come on!

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:02.798
Okay.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.500
That's what I figured.
I needed to be calling you.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.648
Those two came in here. They tried
to sell some of your moonshine.

01:00:08.748 --> 01:00:09.554
Oh, shit!

01:00:09.654 --> 01:00:11.848
- What?
- Pa's here!

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.616
Ada?

01:00:13.716 --> 01:00:16.280
- Ada?!
- Keep your voice down!

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.878
How dare you?!

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:41.510
You think you can just
turn your back on us?!

01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:44.827
They don't care about you out there!
We're all you got!

01:00:44.927 --> 01:00:48.363
And I know what you've been doing now.
It's plain as day!

01:00:48.463 --> 01:00:51.499
There ain't nothing going on
between us! I told you!

01:00:51.599 --> 01:00:54.005
Oh, he's good enough for you
to run off with?

01:00:54.105 --> 01:00:56.465
Then, he's good enough
to get in your pussy!

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:17.247
This is for Bodey.

01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:25.072
And this is for Eilen.

01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:31.320
And this is for my wife.

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.108
I'll do her.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:05.291
Got to start listening, Ada.

01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:09.659
Back before, they'd have killed you
for less than this.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.312
Your pa,
he's gonna work this out, though...

01:02:14.412 --> 01:02:17.932
what needs to be done
for the best of all of us.

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.357
What's that mean?

01:02:23.659 --> 01:02:26.190
I'll let him explain.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.155
What is wrong with you?

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.479
I'm pregnant.

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.963
It ain't much of nothing.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:54.110
She was only two months in.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:58.925
Well, I shouldn't have beaten her
like I did.

01:02:59.928 --> 01:03:02.520
You did what was right.

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:05.761
And we don't need another Dawai
walking around, no way.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.799
You sure it's him?

01:03:09.958 --> 01:03:13.156
Well, whose else would it be?

01:03:16.158 --> 01:03:18.225
How you doing?

01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:25.152
Why didn't you tell us?

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:29.235
I wouldn't have put you up there
and whupped you like that.

01:03:29.485 --> 01:03:30.901
I couldn't.

01:03:31.201 --> 01:03:33.491
She's ashamed,
like she should be.

01:03:33.591 --> 01:03:36.720
I can't believe anyone would lie
with a fool like that.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.240
It's not dawai's.

01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:41.643
Then, whose is it?

01:03:43.325 --> 01:03:45.484
It's Jessaby's.

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:47.877
What'd you say?

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.970
Why else do you think
we took all them walks together?

01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:54.796
Hey! Stop! Loriss!

01:03:54.896 --> 01:03:56.880
Is what you say true?

01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:58.880
Don't you lie to your pa!

01:03:59.062 --> 01:04:00.760
I loved him.

01:04:01.278 --> 01:04:03.595
Get her out of here!

01:04:03.695 --> 01:04:05.122
Shit!

01:04:05.252 --> 01:04:09.011
You tell Corber we'll pay
him whatever he wants.

01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:14.806
Oh, that's right.

01:04:14.965 --> 01:04:18.611
We'd already arranged for you
to be joined with him.

01:04:18.711 --> 01:04:22.853
But he probably won't even want
your sorry ass now!

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.731
You don't make a squeak!

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.676
Maybe we shouldn't even tell Corber.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.154
He'll just say she's ruined, anyway.

01:04:52.254 --> 01:04:54.027
I can't believe she'd do this.
I can't...

01:04:54.127 --> 01:04:57.238
Woman, will you shut your mouth
and let me think?!

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:03.856
Where you going?!

01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:08.313
To the pit.

01:05:34.289 --> 01:05:35.683
Grandpa?

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.178
Where is he?

01:05:38.579 --> 01:05:42.118
I need to speak to
the shunned boy right now.

01:05:42.389 --> 01:05:44.105
You were right!

01:05:44.305 --> 01:05:46.607
Is that what you want to hear?

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.820
How do I stop it?

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:55.375
You know.

01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:58.114
Isn't there some other way?

01:05:58.415 --> 01:06:01.344
It's not of this world.

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:08.767
Come on and do it. I'm sitting right here.
What you waiting for, you old pit?

01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:11.374
I'm sitting right here.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:15.842
I ain't scared of you.
I used to be scared of you.

01:06:15.942 --> 01:06:18.140
Everybody's so scared of you.
I ain't scared of you no more.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:21.029
- So, come on.
- Dawai, did you do it?!

01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:22.033
What?

01:06:22.153 --> 01:06:24.019
You been fucking my daughter?

01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:25.810
No!

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.818
No, I ain't never... Touched her.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:31.962
I ain't never done it with nobody.

01:06:32.062 --> 01:06:34.648
Did you know she was pregnant?

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:37.206
Was?

01:06:37.705 --> 01:06:39.940
You mean, she ain't no more?

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.257
You are no longer with child.

01:06:42.407 --> 01:06:44.591
Why do you resist?

01:06:44.689 --> 01:06:46.468
I don't know.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:48.932
What?

01:06:49.035 --> 01:06:50.594
It's awake.

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:54.543
Well, who do you think it was?

01:07:29.889 --> 01:07:33.566
Why are you still alive?
Where's Sustin?

01:07:33.736 --> 01:07:36.631
It took him.
I don't know why, but it did.

01:07:42.899 --> 01:07:44.778
No!

01:07:45.779 --> 01:07:48.715
This whole thing is 'cause of you!

01:07:48.825 --> 01:07:51.437
I... I'd trade places with him

01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:53.212
You are so dead.

01:07:53.312 --> 01:07:55.110
Stop it! It's not his fault!

01:07:56.450 --> 01:07:58.377
It's because of me.

01:07:58.477 --> 01:08:00.480
It was my jug face.

01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:02.815
- I hid it.
- What?

01:08:02.951 --> 01:08:06.585
I found the jug face that
Dawai made a few days ago...

01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:08.960
And it was mine.

01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:13.315
I got scared, so I buried it in the woods.

01:08:13.415 --> 01:08:16.042
The one he couldn't find?

01:08:16.399 --> 01:08:18.546
I'll take you to it.

01:08:43.899 --> 01:08:45.992
Give it to him.

01:08:52.589 --> 01:08:55.246
You selfish, little bitch.

01:08:55.386 --> 01:08:57.336
Look what all you done.

01:08:57.625 --> 01:09:02.078
You almost ruined us, 'cause of what?
'Cause of your dirty, little secret?

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:07.477
Tomorrow, you're gonna make
this right in front of everyone!

01:09:09.899 --> 01:09:12.725
Tie her with Dawai.

01:09:15.779 --> 01:09:18.194
What about our agreement?

01:09:18.898 --> 01:09:21.506
The pit wants what it wants.

01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:03.954
I'm sorry.

01:10:07.939 --> 01:10:10.710
I'd have tried
to save my baby, too.

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.962
It ain't quite fair, is it?

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:28.062
I reckon they'll do me in after.

01:10:30.659 --> 01:10:32.481
Probably.

01:10:35.894 --> 01:10:37.606
I don't care.

01:10:37.806 --> 01:10:39.986
Tired of them, anyway.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.657
Sleep tight.

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:19.955
What are you doing?

01:11:20.210 --> 01:11:22.411
Coops wants you to go.

01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:24.335
Wait.

01:11:24.435 --> 01:11:26.391
Leave while you can.

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.756
What about dawai?

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.914
He must stay.

01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:35.281
They'll kill him.

01:11:35.489 --> 01:11:38.855
Go. Ada, please, just go!

01:11:38.998 --> 01:11:42.109
If I give myself, will Dawai be spared?

01:11:42.209 --> 01:11:43.474
Yes.

01:11:43.674 --> 01:11:45.488
I'm staying, then.

01:11:45.858 --> 01:11:47.678
No, you ain't!

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:49.914
You ain't staying. Go.

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:51.771
Ada, go.

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:54.038
Hey, where you all going?

01:11:54.258 --> 01:11:56.885
Come back here.
Take her. Hey!

01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:59.611
Hey!
Come back here!

01:12:04.358 --> 01:12:05.509
Hey!

01:12:05.615 --> 01:12:09.698
Ada, I want you to go. I want you
to go somewhere, and you live a life.

01:12:09.798 --> 01:12:12.068
You can do anything.
You can go to town.

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.156
I am doing this for you.

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:19.385
I don't want you to do this for me.

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:23.655
It's what I should have done
in the first place.

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:41.752
I can't bear it.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.530
I love you.

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.232
Who let her go?

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:31.571
She ain't going anywhere.

01:13:33.849 --> 01:13:38.166
Are you ready to give yourself
to the pit, once and for all?

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.111
Yes.

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:09.020
The pit gives,
and the pit takes away.

01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:14.739
It is an honor to go be with it,
away from this earthly plane.

01:14:14.839 --> 01:14:18.621
I hope you are satisfied
with our sacrifice.

01:14:18.721 --> 01:14:22.641
We understand that the pit
wants what it wants.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:26.001
If you have got anything to say,

01:14:26.198 --> 01:14:28.223
let it be known.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.064
I just want to say I'm sorry!

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:38.193
I'm sorry for those who died
'cause of what I done.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.816
And I'm sorry to those left behind.
