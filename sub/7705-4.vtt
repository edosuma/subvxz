(Larry)
'Yes, ALF, we haven't heard
from you in a day or two now.'

00:24.725 --> 00:26.058
- 'How are you?'
- Fine, Lar.

Well, I've got the solution
to this nuclear bomb thing.

00:36.804 --> 00:39.204
- 'Great. Let's hear it.'
- Get rid of 'em.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.073
They're dangerous!

'Okay. Uh, Mr. Dryden,
would you like to respond?'

(Dryden)
'Uh, well, I-I think
what you've done, Mr. ALF'

00:48.182 --> 00:50.916
'is oversimplified
the problem somewhat.'

Better go get the shovel.

Mom, ALF is on the phone again.

00:58.926 --> 01:01.026
I know he is, but it keeps him
out of the kitchen.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.761
- Where is your father?
- I don't know.

01:02.763 --> 01:05.197
Mom, I need to use the phone.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.665
In a minute, dear.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.601
ALF, would-would you
turn that down?

01:09.603 --> 01:11.336
Sorry, Larry. Just some static.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.873
Honey, hi, where have you been?

01:14.875 --> 01:16.942
Hi, Kate.
I'm sorry I'm so late.

01:16.944 --> 01:19.912
Daddy, I have got to get
my own phone.

01:19.914 --> 01:22.681
Oh, fine, thank you. And you?

01:22.683 --> 01:26.018
Hi, uh, B and A.

01:26.020 --> 01:27.953
W!

01:27.955 --> 01:29.788
- Well, why didn't you call?
- I'm sorry.

01:29.790 --> 01:33.692
I tried to call, but somebody's
been on the phone!

01:33.694 --> 01:35.427
Hey, cut me a break!

01:35.429 --> 01:36.728
I'm trying to save your planet

01:36.730 --> 01:39.398
from nuclear devastation,
alright?

01:39.400 --> 01:41.433
Oh? Well, then, go right ahead.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.702
Nothing, Lar,
just a domestic spat.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.571
Daddy, this is totally unfair.

01:45.573 --> 01:47.773
Alright, we'll look
into call-waiting.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.475
- Okay?
- Call-waiting won't help.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.610
I need my own phone line.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.145
Kathy McDermott
has her own phone line

01:53.147 --> 01:56.448
and her family
doesn't even have an alien.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.284
Would they like one?

01:59.286 --> 02:02.488
Willie, she's right. We have
to talk to ALF about the phone.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.456
Right. Uh, ALF..

02:04.458 --> 02:05.591
Yeah, yeah, but what do you do

02:05.593 --> 02:08.827
when your sister
glows in the dark?

02:08.829 --> 02:11.930
Oh, sorry. I didn't know that.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.500
Brian, sit on the couch
and finish your homework.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.168
I'm gonna order
some Chinese food.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.670
Listen, we've gotta talk
about this phone thing.

02:18.672 --> 02:22.841
Sorry, Dryden, no offense, but,
but we're getting nowhere here.

02:22.843 --> 02:26.645
Yeah, I may have to go
over your head. Who's your boss?

02:28.082 --> 02:31.683
The president of what?
All 50 of 'em?

02:31.685 --> 02:33.252
ALF, would you please--

02:33.254 --> 02:34.853
Well, where is he?

02:34.855 --> 02:38.524
Well, don't they have a phone
on the president's plane?

02:38.526 --> 02:40.325
Yeah, yeah, right.
Well, why don't..

02:40.327 --> 02:43.529
Why don't you just give me
that number? Yeah, go ahead.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.697
What? What do you mean?

02:45.699 --> 02:49.034
Well, fine! Be that way!
I'll look it up!

02:49.036 --> 02:51.703
Alright, listen to me,
and listen carefully.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.306
The use of the phone
is a privilege around here

02:54.308 --> 02:56.508
<i> not</i> an inalienable right.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.310
And I mean just that.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.145
Now, if you don't start
showing some consideration

03:00.147 --> 03:01.647
for the rest of us,
that privilege

03:01.649 --> 03:03.549
will be revoked. Is that clear?

03:03.551 --> 03:05.984
I can't concentrate here
with all this noise!

03:05.986 --> 03:08.654
Listen, Brain, when your dad's
through yellin' at ya

03:08.656 --> 03:11.356
come on out with me
to the garage, alright?

03:11.358 --> 03:12.724
Alright.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.961
ALF, I'm talking to<i> you!</i>

03:15.963 --> 03:18.363
Not now, Willie, not now.
I'm on a mission.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.399
Call me when dinner's ready.

03:20.401 --> 03:24.736
Dad, why are you so mad at ALF?

03:24.738 --> 03:27.839
When you grow up
and have an alien of your own

03:27.841 --> 03:29.975

What's the Jetson kid's name?

04:51.892 --> 04:53.258
- Leroy?
- Elroy.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.493
That's it.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.828
Uh, listen, ALF,
uh, the food came.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.830
I thought
maybe we could eat out here

04:58.832 --> 05:01.266
uh, ha-have a little chat.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.734
I'd like that.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.270
What happened here?

05:05.272 --> 05:07.906
(Willie)
'That's twice-cooked pork.'

05:07.908 --> 05:10.809
Looks like twice-eaten pork.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.177
Alright, ALF, listen

05:12.179 --> 05:14.646
uh, I'm not sure
I had your full attention--

05:14.648 --> 05:15.847
Hey, I hate to interrupt you

05:15.849 --> 05:17.182
but can you hand me
a screwdriver?

05:17.184 --> 05:18.817
- Yeah, sure.
- Phillips!

05:18.819 --> 05:21.853
- Okay. Uh, there you go.
- Thanks.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.289
You know, ALF,
we've all gotta do our part

05:24.291 --> 05:27.693
to get along here,
you see, a family is like--

05:27.695 --> 05:29.428
- Pliers.
- Yes.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.863
Or a crescent wrench.

05:31.865 --> 05:35.033
Each one adjusts to each
little situation as need be--

05:35.035 --> 05:38.470
- Hand me the pliers!
- Oh, yeah, sure.

05:38.472 --> 05:41.039
Alright, listen.
Here's what I'm trying to say.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.808
- Go for it.
- Uh..

05:42.810 --> 05:44.876
It's a question of respect

05:44.878 --> 05:48.146
and cooperation, of course,
and courtesy.

05:48.148 --> 05:52.150
The three Cs. Cooperation,
courtesy and respect.

05:52.152 --> 05:55.954
Well, uh, two Cs and an R.
But you-you see what I mean.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.556
- Huh?
- Absolutely, look.

05:57.558 --> 06:00.058
Would you hold this wire
while I turn on the juice?

06:00.060 --> 06:01.493
- Sure. You know..
- Right there.

06:01.495 --> 06:04.262
That's my short-wave radio!

06:06.900 --> 06:10.202

06:10.838 --> 06:12.537
Lo-o-ong..

06:13.807 --> 06:15.574
It took me ten years

06:15.576 --> 06:17.676
to put that thing together.

06:17.678 --> 06:21.246
I'm glad to see
you haven't wasted<i> your</i> life.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.348
First the phone
and now the radio.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.751
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What about the phone?

06:25.753 --> 06:27.552
You're on it all the time.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.588
Hey! Operators are standing by!

06:29.590 --> 06:33.759
- I've got calls to make.
- It's got to stop.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.762
Fine.
First I can't use the radio.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.830
Now I can't use the phone.

06:38.832 --> 06:41.233
What next? The curling iron?

06:41.235 --> 06:44.736
- Your toothbrush?
- You use my toothbrush?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.938
Yours is the green one, right?

06:47.741 --> 06:49.341
It was.

06:49.343 --> 06:51.543
Alright, what's the big deal?
I'll use Kate's.

06:51.545 --> 06:55.414
No, you're not using
<i> anybody's</i> toothbrush.

06:55.416 --> 06:59.050
Okay. No toothbrush.
What about the radio?

06:59.052 --> 07:01.787
Alright, just don't
put it in your mouth.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.855
Thanks,
I'll be through in a minute

07:03.857 --> 07:06.258
as soon as I contact
Air Force One.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.959
- The president's plane?
- 'Mm-hmm.'

07:07.961 --> 07:10.762
No. No, you can't do that.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.297
Willie, it's my duty.

07:12.299 --> 07:13.899
I mean, I mean,
I've been through

07:13.901 --> 07:16.268
one nuclear disaster already.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.403
It's no picnic.

07:18.405 --> 07:19.638
Nuclear? The..

07:19.640 --> 07:22.073
You mean, that's how
your planet exploded?

07:22.075 --> 07:25.877
No, we all plugged our
hair dryers in at the same time.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.915
Listen, ALF,
even if you could figure out

07:29.917 --> 07:32.150
how to call the president,
you'd never get through

07:32.152 --> 07:34.553
because that signal's scrambled.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.887
- So?
- So..

07:35.889 --> 07:38.590
It's illegal
to break a scrambled signal.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.058
And it's immoral!

07:40.060 --> 07:42.661
What about you and "Tootsie?"

07:42.663 --> 07:44.663
I beg your pardon?

07:44.665 --> 07:48.099
Well, last week
we all watched "Tootsie" on HBO.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.401
Isn't HBO scrambled?

07:49.403 --> 07:51.837
- Well, yes, but--
- But what?

07:51.839 --> 07:53.972
Seeing that
you don't pay for HBO

07:53.974 --> 07:57.676
isn't what you're doing
illegal, immoral?

07:57.678 --> 08:00.579
Absolutely not.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.948
They gave us
a two-week free trial

08:02.950 --> 08:05.183
and they forgot to unhook it.

08:11.191 --> 08:14.025
Just, uh, put the radio
back together when..

08:14.027 --> 08:15.594
No problem.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.865
[sighs]
Are you gonna eat this food?

08:19.867 --> 08:21.032
No, but leave it.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.467
I'd like to see what it does

as the case may be?

08:57.137 --> 09:00.138
ALF? ALF who?

09:01.708 --> 09:05.210
- Mr. Defoe--
- Not now, Hogarth. I'm winning.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.580
Yes, sir, but perhaps
you should take this call.

09:08.582 --> 09:12.083
- What does she want now?
- It's not your wife, sir.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.252
It's someone
calling himself ALF.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.054
And he wants to talk
to the president.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.223
What? How did he get the code?

09:18.225 --> 09:20.992
I don't know.
Maybe from your wife.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.528
That's a joke, sir.

09:23.530 --> 09:26.097
Not funny, Hogarth.

09:26.099 --> 09:29.000
Apparently not, sir.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.002
Do you wanna talk to ALF?

- ALF who?
- I don't know, sir.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.609

09:46.853 --> 09:48.720
And get me an immediate trace
on this call.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.555
- Tracing, sir.
- And punch up the speaker.

09:50.557 --> 09:53.491
- You should listen to this.
- Punching and listening, sir.

What have we got on the A-L-F?

10:43.844 --> 10:44.943
Well, so far we've got

10:44.945 --> 10:46.578
the American Laundry Federation

10:46.580 --> 10:50.515
and the Association
of Lawn Fertilizer.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.251
Shall we round them up?

10:54.955 --> 10:57.155
The tracing's complete, sir.

10:58.692 --> 11:01.493
Mister, about those bombs

11:01.495 --> 11:03.762
shall I interpret this
to be a threat?

11:03.764 --> 11:07.198
(ALF)
'Of course, it's a threat.
What kind of question is that?'

11:07.200 --> 11:09.601
That's all I wanted to hear.

11:11.605 --> 11:12.671
Get me the FBI.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.673
[instrumental music]

11:16.043 --> 11:17.976
Okay, I think I solved it.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.211
Everybody,
give me your attention.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.347
What are, what are we watching?

11:22.349 --> 11:24.382
- "Tootsie."
- Oh, no.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.017
Let's not watch that.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.219
Let's not watch anything.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.355
I wanna show you my chart.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.125
- Yo, Willie!
- Yeah! What?

11:34.127 --> 11:38.496
Quick question.
What does FBI stand for?

11:38.498 --> 11:41.232
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Why?

11:41.234 --> 11:43.802
Just curious.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.471
Well, uh, what do you think?

11:46.473 --> 11:48.206
It's very nice, dear.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.676
This shows our whole family,
aliens inclusive

11:51.678 --> 11:53.912
and when each of us
can use the phone.

11:53.914 --> 11:57.082
Oh, honey, I'm sorry, but Brian
can't stay up till 11 o'clock.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.983
Oh, no, that's a mistake.

11:58.985 --> 12:01.186
Uh, we'll switch that
with Lynn's time

12:01.188 --> 12:02.754
to call her boyfriend.

12:02.756 --> 12:06.291
Daddy, Lash can't stay up
until 11 o'clock.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.560
[doorbell ringing]

12:09.596 --> 12:11.529
Who am I going to call
at 4 a.m.?

12:11.531 --> 12:14.799
I know, it's not perfect,
but it's a start.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.338
Howdy.
Sorry to bother you like this.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.607
But I was wondering
if Willie Tanner might be in.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.375
- Oh, speaking.
- Oh, excellent.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.944
- FBI.
- You have the right..

12:25.946 --> 12:27.178
- To remain silent.
- What?

12:27.180 --> 12:29.013
- Daddy!
- What are you doing?

12:29.015 --> 12:32.350
- Kate!
- Mommy, make them stop.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.752
Please. Please, leave him alone.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.687
We'll just be a minute, ma'am.
Let's go, pal.

12:35.689 --> 12:37.889
- And we'll take this, too.
- No, not my chart!

12:37.891 --> 12:40.391
- Sorry for the trouble, ma'am.
- Why are you doing this?

12:40.393 --> 12:42.527
It's the law, ma'am.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.763
This is what happens
when someone threatens

12:44.765 --> 12:46.931
national security.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.366
Nice meeting you.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.902
(Willie)
'Oh, hello, Mrs. Ochmonek.'

12:50.904 --> 12:53.371
Mom, what did he do?

12:54.274 --> 12:56.474
I don't know.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.476
Hey, what's going on?

12:58.478 --> 13:00.411
Daddy's been arrested.

13:00.413 --> 13:03.782
Boy, those HBO guys
mean business.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.652
[instrumental music]

13:10.991 --> 13:13.324
I can't believe ALF
actually used your short wave

13:13.326 --> 13:14.626
to call the president!

13:14.628 --> 13:15.994
Shh, shh!

13:19.599 --> 13:22.500
I don't know what happened, all
I know is somebody used my radio

13:22.502 --> 13:25.837
and now I'm a criminal,
and they're going to hang me.

13:25.839 --> 13:29.107
Willie, I don't think
they hang people anymore.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.442
But they think I'm a threat
to national security.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.179
A terrorist, Kate.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.447
I'm not a terrorist.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.850
Honey, I know that.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.852
They fingerprinted me.

13:40.854 --> 13:43.822
It washes right off.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.623
I'm not going to prison.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.992
I saw "Midnight Express."
You remember?

13:47.994 --> 13:50.695
- They made him eat bugs.
- That was "Papillon."

13:50.697 --> 13:53.464
In "Midnight Express"
they broke his feet.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.533
I stand corrected.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.269
How about "Stir Crazy?"
That wasn't so bad.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.772
That was a comedy.

14:00.774 --> 14:02.340
Willie, stop.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.175
It's obvious
you have to tell the truth.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.276
Of-of course, the truth.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.811
I'll just,
I'll explain it to them.

14:06.813 --> 14:09.380
An alien took control
of my radio.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.982
"Uh, why would he do that?"
they'll ask.

14:10.984 --> 14:14.385
And I'll say, "Because I
wouldn't let him use the phone."

14:16.289 --> 14:17.655
Maybe, we can clear
this whole thing up

14:17.657 --> 14:19.724
without having
to tell the truth.

14:19.726 --> 14:22.060
The truth is,
I never should have let ALF

14:22.062 --> 14:24.696
anywhere<i> near</i> my short wave!

14:26.900 --> 14:31.169
Okay, okay, maybe it was wrong
of ALF to call the president.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.304
Maybe?

14:33.306 --> 14:35.340
Alright..

14:35.342 --> 14:37.041
Okay, it was wrong.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.977
But, you know, you have
to respect him for the way

14:38.979 --> 14:40.578
he feels about nuclear war.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.247
I think it's commendable
that he's willing

14:42.249 --> 14:45.850
to send me to jail
for his beliefs.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.853
At least he cares about
something other than food.

14:48.855 --> 14:53.358
Great. Now he cares about
nuclear war and food.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.794
Sorry, ma'am, I need a moment
alone with the alleged traitor.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.097
Willie, I'll be right back.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.432
I'm gonna see what's taking
that lawyer so long.

15:01.434 --> 15:02.834
You wait here.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.638
Right. Sorry.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.574
Good afternoon, ALF.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.645
I need to talk with you
about this.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.448
Just who are all these people

15:17.450 --> 15:19.918
and why are they on the phone
all the time?

15:21.421 --> 15:24.622
[dramatic music]

15:28.128 --> 15:30.628
Watch, this is my favorite part.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.363
Why is dad on TV again?

15:32.365 --> 15:34.299
He's not. I taped it.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.734
- You taped my dad's arrest?
- Yeah.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.136
Thought he might like
to catch it

15:38.138 --> 15:39.938
when he gets out of the slammer

15:39.940 --> 15:43.274
see what he looked like
when he was young.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.610
ALF, I mean it.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.046
Sometimes
I don't understand you at all.

15:48.048 --> 15:51.015
- Tell her, Brian.
- He's an alien.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.785
Okay, but besides that.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.486
Don't you get
what's happened here?

15:55.488 --> 15:57.622
My dad got<i> arrested </i>
because of you.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.290
Don't you even care?

15:59.292 --> 16:02.727
Of course I care.
I feel terrible.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.997
He's my Willie. My goombah.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.166
It just doesn't seem like it
sometimes.

16:08.168 --> 16:11.336
Hey, I haven't forgotten
about him.

16:11.338 --> 16:15.673
In fact, I'm working
on something right now.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.142
Alright, now look,
the FBI's got him.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.644
- Right?
- Right.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.513
And-and-and who gives the orders
to the FBI?

16:22.515 --> 16:25.516
- The president, right?
- Right.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.919
No problem.

16:27.921 --> 16:30.888
The big guy and I
are, are like that.

16:31.591 --> 16:32.657
Come on, Brian.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.592
Let's go spring daddy.

16:34.594 --> 16:37.762
[instrumental music]

16:46.706 --> 16:50.842
May I suggest playing that
black seven off the red eight?

16:52.545 --> 16:55.313
May I suggest
you answer the phone, Hogarth?

16:55.315 --> 16:57.115
Yes, sir.

16:57.117 --> 17:00.551
Air Force One. How may
I help you, sir or madam?

17:01.855 --> 17:04.188
Oh, hello, ALF.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.491
- Mr. Defoe, it's him!
- Him who, Hogarth?

17:06.493 --> 17:07.959
It's ALF, sir!

17:07.961 --> 17:10.795
[chuckles]
That's not possible. We got him.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.363
Unless
there's a whole nest of them.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.399
- Hogarth.
- Yes, sir. A-L-F.

17:14.401 --> 17:18.036
I have
the Alabama Lunatic Fringe..

17:18.038 --> 17:20.571
Will you see if Willie Tanner's
still in jail?

17:20.573 --> 17:22.840
Yes, sir.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.076
You might try that four of
spades on the five of diamonds--

17:25.078 --> 17:28.679
Just place the call.
And trace this one.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.648
Placing and tracing, sir.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.084
Defoe here.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.586
Yo, Defoe, remember me?

17:35.588 --> 17:37.755
How about putting the chief on?

17:37.757 --> 17:39.924
Uh, I'm sorry, he's indisposed.

17:39.926 --> 17:43.061
You mean
he's in the bathroom again.

17:43.063 --> 17:45.229
That's classified.
What do you want now?

17:45.231 --> 17:48.766
Listen, no offense,
but, uh, last time we talked

17:48.768 --> 17:52.070
things got all messed up.
I'll call back when he's out.

17:52.072 --> 17:56.174
No! Uh, no.
I'll-I'll see what I can do.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.078
[clicks]

18:03.249 --> 18:04.882
Hello, sir?

18:04.884 --> 18:07.685
I'm sorry to bother you in there

18:07.687 --> 18:08.953
but we have
this little situation.

18:08.955 --> 18:11.222
I-I wonder if you could talk
to someone

18:11.224 --> 18:13.157
while we trace his call?

18:14.094 --> 18:16.094
Yes, sir, on the phone.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.296
Thank you, sir. Line 2.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.599
Line 2, sir.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.135
One more.

18:24.137 --> 18:26.137
Count from the left.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.271
There you go.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.442
(president on radio)
'Uh, hello?'

18:31.444 --> 18:33.211
Listen, I know you're a busy guy

18:33.213 --> 18:35.146
so I'll make this brief.

18:35.148 --> 18:36.881
Willie Tanner's in jail.

18:36.883 --> 18:39.484
And I think it's my fault.

18:39.486 --> 18:42.553
- 'Oh, really?'
- Yeah, he's innocent.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.322
He didn't call you, I did.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.992
(president)
'Oh, goodness, it-it sounds
pretty complicated.'

18:47.994 --> 18:49.594
Yeah,
but it shouldn't have been.

18:49.596 --> 18:50.962
You see, all I wanted to do

18:50.964 --> 18:53.598
was talk to you
about your bombs.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.266
'Oh, now look,
you're not gonna bring up'

18:55.268 --> 18:56.400
'the "Bonzo" films again.'

18:56.402 --> 18:57.602
'I was under contract.'

18:57.604 --> 18:59.770
'I had no choice.'

18:59.772 --> 19:03.841
No, no, no, not those bombs.
The nuclear ones.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.676
We've only got one planet.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.745
So why don't you and the Russki

19:07.747 --> 19:09.981
<i> ease</i> up a little, will ya?

19:11.251 --> 19:14.352
'I'm, uh, I'm sure we'll do'

19:14.354 --> 19:16.120
'everything we can.'

19:16.122 --> 19:18.990
Hope I haven't oversimplified
the problem.

19:18.992 --> 19:23.361
'Oh, hold on. They did?
Goody. Thank you.'

19:23.363 --> 19:26.864
'Uh, Mr. ALF, we're sending
someone around right now'

19:26.866 --> 19:29.934
'to follow up on this thing.
You just sit tight, okay?'

19:29.936 --> 19:33.371
You, too. Loved Patty's book.

19:34.541 --> 19:37.208
Perfect. They're on their way.

19:37.210 --> 19:40.211
Perfect? They're not
coming here to help.

19:40.213 --> 19:44.315
They're coming here to arrest
us, like they arrested daddy!

19:44.317 --> 19:46.484
Brian, Brian, get a grip!

19:46.486 --> 19:47.718
You think your old buddy ALF

19:47.720 --> 19:49.654
would get his family
in hot water

19:49.656 --> 19:52.056
if he didn't have
a foolproof backup plan?

19:52.058 --> 19:54.825
- Sure.
- Of course, he would.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.762
But this time I have a plan.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.635
FBI! Freeze!

20:05.572 --> 20:08.306
Wait a minute. Who are you?

20:08.308 --> 20:11.676
Me? I'm ALF. ALF Tanner.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.811
You're ALF?

20:13.813 --> 20:16.414
- How old are you?
- Six.

20:16.416 --> 20:19.016
- But I'm going on seven.
- I thought I heard someone.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.851
Oh, good afternoon, ma'am.
Good to see you again.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.387
Doing something different
with your hair?

20:23.389 --> 20:24.922
What are you doing here?

20:24.924 --> 20:28.192
- Brian, what's going on here?
- Brian?

20:28.194 --> 20:31.028
- I thought his name was ALF.
- ALF?

20:31.030 --> 20:33.264
What do you mean
his name is ALF?

20:33.266 --> 20:34.565
[Brian clears throat]

20:34.567 --> 20:36.767
Oh, ALF!

20:36.769 --> 20:39.704
Yes, yes, of course, it is.

20:39.706 --> 20:42.607
Uh, I mean, uh,
his real name is-is Brian

20:42.609 --> 20:46.544
but we call him ALF, for short.

20:46.546 --> 20:47.878
Kind of a pet name.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.780
Ma'am, were you aware that ALF

20:49.782 --> 20:51.716
was using this radio equipment?

20:51.718 --> 20:53.918
Well, no, I was not aware.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.555
But, yes,
I am becoming aware of it now.

20:57.557 --> 21:00.625
Brian, what did we say

21:00.627 --> 21:02.793
about calling the president?

21:02.795 --> 21:05.529
- I don't know.
- We said..

21:05.531 --> 21:07.465
Not until after your homework.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.367
Oh, right.

21:09.369 --> 21:12.136
Surely you don't think an
innocent little child like this

21:12.138 --> 21:14.905
could be a threat
to national security?

21:14.907 --> 21:17.408
Well, ma'am, uh..

21:17.410 --> 21:19.644
Would you excuse us
for a minute, please?

21:19.646 --> 21:21.212
[clears throat]

21:22.282 --> 21:24.215
What do you think?

21:24.217 --> 21:25.616
About what?

21:25.618 --> 21:28.085
About what she just said,
could national security

21:28.087 --> 21:29.587
be threatened by a six-year-old?

21:29.589 --> 21:30.955
Oh, he's going on seven.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.057
Still, the president
would not want us

21:33.059 --> 21:35.993
to arrest a little kid.
It'd embarrass everybody.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.828
- Then we shouldn't do it.
- Hm.

21:37.830 --> 21:41.299
Excuse me.
Are you arresting my son?

21:41.301 --> 21:44.635
Um, not at this
point of time, ma'am.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.771
[sighs]
Thank goodness!

21:46.773 --> 21:49.140
What about releasing my husband?

21:49.142 --> 21:50.608
Well, I'm afraid
we're gonna have to call

21:50.610 --> 21:52.009
the president on that one.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.645
I'll call him for you.

21:54.647 --> 21:57.481
- ALF?
- No problem.

21:57.483 --> 22:00.484
[instrumental music]

22:04.757 --> 22:07.425
[instrumental music]

22:11.464 --> 22:12.830
(Kate)
Here we go.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.865
- Reach in there.
- Let's see.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.934
- Oh..
- Ah!

22:16.936 --> 22:19.704
A Presidential Commendation!

22:19.706 --> 22:21.372
Isn't that wonderful?

22:21.374 --> 22:23.974
"To Brian ALF Tanner

22:23.976 --> 22:27.044
"for exposing gaps
in national security

22:27.046 --> 22:30.281
"and for his concern
about world peace

22:30.283 --> 22:33.984
which is something
that I'm in favor of myself."

22:33.986 --> 22:36.120
Alright, Brian, way to go!

22:36.122 --> 22:38.489
"I'm reminded
of my humble beginnings

22:38.491 --> 22:40.891
"when I built a crystal set
in the basement

22:40.893 --> 22:43.527
"of my parents' home in Illinois

22:43.529 --> 22:45.963
or Iowa."

22:46.866 --> 22:49.133
Hey, can you hold it down?

22:49.135 --> 22:51.702
- My show's coming on.
- What's the matter with you?

22:51.704 --> 22:55.539
Oh, nothing, it's not like
<i> I</i> had something to do

22:55.541 --> 22:57.575
with that plaque myself.

22:57.577 --> 23:01.479
Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.547
I feel terrible.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.549
Didn't I thank you?

23:05.551 --> 23:07.918
Did I not say thanks

23:07.920 --> 23:10.654
for subjecting me
to public humiliation?

23:10.656 --> 23:13.057
For almost costing me my job?

23:13.059 --> 23:16.160
For landing me in jail,
for subjecting me--

23:16.162 --> 23:19.330
Hold that thought, will you,
William? The show is on.

23:19.332 --> 23:21.699
Larry's discussing
the Middle East crisis

23:21.701 --> 23:24.835
with Muammar Gaddafi and Charo.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.939
- Daddy, about the phone--
- I know.

23:28.941 --> 23:32.843
I had a lot of time to think
in jail

23:32.845 --> 23:35.379
and, uh, I decided
it's probably worth

23:35.381 --> 23:38.282
the $25 or whatever
for your own line.

23:38.284 --> 23:40.084
Oh, daddy, thanks.

23:40.086 --> 23:43.087
Yeah, that's swell.
Make it a Princess, will ya?

23:43.089 --> 23:45.890
It's not for you, it's for her!

23:45.892 --> 23:46.924
What are you getting me?

23:46.926 --> 23:48.426
I'm getting you your own

23:48.428 --> 23:50.127
toothbrush.

23:50.129 --> 23:53.931
- Why?
- Never mind. You'll thank me.

23:53.933 --> 23:59.103
Yo, Charo,<i> que pasa? </i>
Yeah. Uh-huh.
