00:19.060 --> 00:20.353
["The Distance"
by CAKE playing]

00:20.395 --> 00:23.356
* Reluctantly crouched
at the starting line *

00:23.398 --> 00:26.026
* Engines pumping
and thumping in time *

00:26.067 --> 00:28.737
* The green light flashes
the flags go up *

00:28.778 --> 00:31.281
* Churning and burning
they yearn for the cup *

00:31.322 --> 00:33.867
* They deftly maneuver
and muscle for rank *

00:33.908 --> 00:35.410
* Fuel burning fast *

00:35.452 --> 00:36.786
- If they're not black and blue,
they're not gettin' through.

00:36.828 --> 00:39.164
* Reckless and wild
They pour through the turns *

00:39.205 --> 00:41.082
[Sweet Tooth laughing]

00:41.124 --> 00:43.668
- Time to send in
the clown.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.545
- Let's clear a path.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.255
* Driving and striving
as fast as he can *

00:47.297 --> 00:50.216
[truck horn honking]

00:50.258 --> 00:52.552
* And long ago somebody
left with the cup *

00:52.594 --> 00:55.263
* But he's driving and striving
and hugging the turns *

00:55.305 --> 00:58.516
* And thinking of someone
for whom he still burns *

00:58.558 --> 00:59.851
[gunfire]

00:59.893 --> 01:02.228
* He's going the distance *

01:02.270 --> 01:04.606
* He's going for speed *

01:04.647 --> 01:09.069
* She's all alone all alone
all alone in her time of need *

01:09.110 --> 01:11.529
[gunfire continues]

01:11.571 --> 01:12.947
- Line me up.

01:12.989 --> 01:14.741
* And plotting the course
he's fighting and biting *

01:14.783 --> 01:19.079
* And riding on his horse
He's going the distance *

01:19.120 --> 01:21.831
- Fuck, that was cool!

01:21.873 --> 01:24.751
- [Watts] These cops can't
drive for shit! Ha!

01:24.793 --> 01:27.754
[gunfire]

01:27.796 --> 01:30.840
- Uh, they're still alive!
- I noticed! The gun is jammed.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.300
- Take the wheel!

01:35.595 --> 01:37.389
[tires squealing]
Watch your left. Swerve!

01:37.430 --> 01:39.182
- Stop backseat driving
and fix that fucking thing.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.433
- I am!

01:40.475 --> 01:43.311
[gunfire]

01:43.353 --> 01:45.313

Fixed!

01:45.355 --> 01:49.150

01:49.192 --> 01:51.319
Jell-O, Lawman!
[laughs]

01:51.361 --> 01:52.696
- Why do you always
say "Jell-O" like that?

01:52.737 --> 01:54.489
- It means "good-bye."
- What? No, it doesn't.

01:54.531 --> 01:57.200
It's a dessert, you moron.
- No, it's insider slang.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.494
A dude said it after
dinner before he--

01:59.536 --> 02:02.706
Oh, God damn it!
[car approaching]

02:02.747 --> 02:04.499

[gunshots]

02:10.005 --> 02:11.673
[moaning]

02:13.383 --> 02:16.428
- Aw, I always knew you two
would work things out,

02:16.469 --> 02:18.430
and I love what you've
done with the car.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.723
- Hey, thanks, man.

02:19.764 --> 02:22.308
Love what you've done
with your, uh, fire hair.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.185
- Looks really good.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.062
- Aw, I'm just trying
something new.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.772
- Hey, I heard you got
a beef with Stone.

02:27.814 --> 02:32.110
- [laughs] Beef? I got
a whole butcher shop.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.947
Stone is mine.
Ta!

02:35.989 --> 02:38.491
- Bye!

02:38.533 --> 02:41.870
- Screw you, man!
- Holy shit!

02:41.911 --> 02:44.039
It's-- I wanna say,
uh, Blue?

02:44.080 --> 02:46.291
- No, it begins with "S."
It's on the tip of my tongue.

02:46.332 --> 02:49.669
- Stu! Stu!
- [both] Stu!

02:49.711 --> 02:52.130

03:46.476 --> 03:48.687
- Now's your chance
to skedaddle.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.355
- We can't leave you
to fight this.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.731
- The fuck you can't.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.942
I'm tired of y'all.
You're bogarting my kills.

03:53.983 --> 03:55.443

03:55.485 --> 03:57.487
- [Amber] Juggernaut to Twister,
we're flying in.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.489
- [Watts] Amber, you keep
laying down that fire.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.700
These chickens are
flying the coop.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.326
- [Quiet] Thanks a lot.
This next round's on us.

04:03.368 --> 04:06.454
- Shit. Would someone kill
this fucking truck?

04:06.496 --> 04:08.248
- [Lawman]
You got it, sir!

04:08.289 --> 04:09.958
- Amber!
- [gasping]

04:10.000 --> 04:12.085
[gunfire]

04:12.127 --> 04:14.129
- [Sweet Tooth] Where do you
think you're going, Stone?

04:14.170 --> 04:15.630
You can't hide from me.

04:15.672 --> 04:19.300
Ice cream?
No, you scream.

04:19.342 --> 04:22.804
[laughing]

04:22.846 --> 04:25.473
[explosions]

04:28.309 --> 04:30.437
- No! No! Amber!

- [breathing heavily]

04:38.403 --> 04:41.614
- Why'd you do that?
They were on our side!

04:41.656 --> 04:45.243
- [laughing]
There are no sides, Stubert!

04:45.285 --> 04:47.454
Everybody burns!

- [laughing]
Okay, Stubie,

04:57.380 --> 05:00.216
now's your chance
to show me your fangs.

05:00.258 --> 05:03.511
Pull the trigger,
and put your doggy down.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.308
- [breathing heavily]
- Do it!

05:08.350 --> 05:10.143
- Come on, do it!
- Do it!

05:10.185 --> 05:12.145
- Come on.

05:12.187 --> 05:14.814
Come on, Stewie.
You can do this.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.866
[grunting]

05:28.912 --> 05:30.330
- You saved my ass!

05:30.372 --> 05:32.415
- I-I think I skinned
my wang.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.668
- Oh, don't talk
about your wang, man.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.211
- I don't want
to look at it, man.

05:36.252 --> 05:40.757
- [groaning]
Stubert!

05:40.799 --> 05:42.384
[gunfire]

05:42.425 --> 05:44.678
- You'll abide
by the law, clown.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.013
- Harold,
take the wheel.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.351
[grunts]

05:51.393 --> 05:52.811
- Get off my car!

05:52.852 --> 05:57.774
- You! Took! Everything!
From! Me!

05:57.816 --> 05:59.567
- What the fuck?

05:59.609 --> 06:02.779
Hey! You're dripping
eye blood on the hoo--

06:02.821 --> 06:03.446
Oh, fuck it.

- [groaning]

06:08.576 --> 06:11.746

06:15.875 --> 06:17.419
- Oh, shit!

06:17.460 --> 06:19.546
Did I--
Did I kill him?

06:19.587 --> 06:20.463
- I don't know.
You want to turn around

06:20.505 --> 06:21.589
and check for a pulse?

06:21.631 --> 06:23.717
Let's get the hell outta here!
Let's go!

06:23.758 --> 06:24.884
Get outta here!
Let's go!

06:30.140 --> 06:33.351
[engine revving]

06:33.393 --> 06:35.937
- Holy shit, I think
we're gonna make it.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.064
[gunfire]

06:38.106 --> 06:39.524
- [growling]

06:39.566 --> 06:44.195
- God, I'm so tired of running
from Officer Dick Cheese.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.198
Hang on.
- Thanks for the warning.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.784
Whoa!
[tires squealing]

06:52.412 --> 06:55.832
- Oh, okay,
we can play chicken.

06:55.874 --> 06:59.085
[gunfire and rockets whistling]

06:59.127 --> 07:00.670
Come on, fuckers!

07:00.712 --> 07:02.213

07:02.255 --> 07:04.215
- Now!
- Now!

07:21.691 --> 07:24.778
[birds chirping]

07:29.616 --> 07:31.451
- John?

07:31.493 --> 07:33.620
John! John!

07:33.661 --> 07:34.829
[screams]
- Get outta there!

07:37.749 --> 07:39.959
Well, oh, well.

07:40.001 --> 07:42.671
It's just you and me again.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.673
You know, when I was walking
a beat in Topeka,

07:44.714 --> 07:47.342
I used to see pieces
of trash just like you.

07:47.384 --> 07:51.971
They'd mock me,
call me names, spit on me,

07:52.013 --> 07:56.351
just because I was tryin'
to keep the streets safe.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.770
When the power grid blew,

07:58.812 --> 08:01.898
all of those same fuckheads
came to my door

08:01.940 --> 08:03.483
wanting to be protected,

08:03.525 --> 08:06.069
wanting to be safe,

08:06.111 --> 08:07.320
but you know what
they really wanted?

08:10.865 --> 08:14.327
They just wanted
to be kept in line.

08:14.369 --> 08:20.333
- [laughing]

08:20.375 --> 08:23.378
- What's so fuckin' funny?

08:23.420 --> 08:26.214
- You talk so much.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.800
All this talk
about rules and laws,

08:28.842 --> 08:30.552
it's all bullshit.

08:30.593 --> 08:35.849
You're just a sad,
lonely man,

08:35.890 --> 08:40.186
and you think
you're in control.

08:40.228 --> 08:43.481
- I am in control.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.067
- No.

08:46.109 --> 08:49.237
You're just the one
holdin' the gun.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.701
- Any last words?

08:54.743 --> 08:59.622
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

08:59.664 --> 09:01.249
[screaming]

09:01.291 --> 09:03.293
[whimpering]

[ragged breathing]

09:19.434 --> 09:20.518
[groaning]

09:23.980 --> 09:27.901
- I'm gonna give you
a tough choice.

09:27.942 --> 09:31.529
You can die slowly,
or...

09:37.077 --> 09:39.746
[whispers]
You can die fast.

09:39.788 --> 09:42.415
You have a good day now,

09:42.457 --> 09:43.792
motherfucker.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.548
[engine starts]

10:12.487 --> 10:13.530
[gunshot]

10:27.419 --> 10:30.505

10:32.757 --> 10:36.261
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

10:36.302 --> 10:38.346
[laughing]

10:38.388 --> 10:42.183
- Oh, I fucking thought
I lost you again.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.438
Oh, where's--

10:53.528 --> 10:55.155
[sniffles]

11:00.827 --> 11:03.163
- I'm sorry.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.998
- Those fuckers
are gonna pay.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.378
[engine revving]

11:14.758 --> 11:16.676
- Hey, Bill, I'm back!
You miss me?

11:16.718 --> 11:18.011
- Bill got promoted.

11:18.053 --> 11:20.347
You do not have clearance
to approach.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.057
- Look, I know you're just
trying to do your job,

11:22.098 --> 11:23.725
but I have a life-changing
opportunity

11:23.767 --> 11:25.352
that's going to expire

11:25.393 --> 11:28.855
if I don't deliver this package
in one minute and 17, 16, 15--

11:28.897 --> 11:30.106
You see where
I'm going with this?

11:30.148 --> 11:31.816
- Yeah, that's not my problem.
- Uh, it will be

11:31.858 --> 11:36.279
if Raven hears her delivery
expired right outside her gate.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.073
- Holy shit.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.579
Tell Raven
the Milkman made it.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.581
- Let's go.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.959
- Open the gate!

11:54.923 --> 11:56.925
- You didn't tell me
she was so hot.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.600
- Someone's had
a busy ten days.

12:05.642 --> 12:06.976
- And I'm not
the only one.

12:07.018 --> 12:09.396
Hey, congratulations
on the promotion, Bill!

12:09.437 --> 12:11.773
She treatin' you well?
Good pay? Good benefits?

12:11.815 --> 12:13.525
- Just give her
the package, John.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.360
- Wow. Fuck you, Bill.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.324
- How do we know she's
actually going to pay up?

12:21.366 --> 12:23.535
- This is how Milkman
deliveries work.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.620
Only person who's making it
weird right now is you.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.928
- Congratulations, John.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.430
Welcome to New San Francisco.

12:46.391 --> 12:47.308
[gun cocking]

12:47.350 --> 12:48.727
- Hey, hey, whoa!
Hold on, man.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.229
Bill, calm down.
She's with me.

12:51.271 --> 12:55.775
- John, she's not
allowed to enter.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.820
- Well, you wouldn't have it
if it wasn't for her.

12:58.862 --> 13:01.948
- We had a deal, John,

13:01.990 --> 13:03.450
you and me.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.744
- And she's with me.
That's all you need to know.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.287
[guns cocking]

13:14.336 --> 13:17.964
If she can't go in, fine.
I'm not goin' in either.

13:18.006 --> 13:21.051
- John, don't do this.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.597
You wanted this
your whole life, right?

13:25.638 --> 13:29.184
- Yeah, but--
- Then you need to go.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.106
- What are you doin'?

13:35.148 --> 13:38.109
- I'm not gonna be the reason
you don't go inside,

13:38.151 --> 13:40.904
so you're gonna go in,
and you're gonna be happy.

13:40.945 --> 13:44.074
You got it?
[gun cocking]

13:44.115 --> 13:46.117
Don't, John.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.620
I mean it.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.246
- Quiet--
[gunshot]

13:50.288 --> 13:51.164
Aah!

13:55.251 --> 13:57.712
- He needs medical attention.
Get him inside.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.547
- Go on.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.508
- [grunting]

14:08.056 --> 14:12.811
What? Quiet, no!
Quiet!

14:12.852 --> 14:14.854
Quiet!

14:14.896 --> 14:17.524
- Jell-O, John.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.067
[door slams]

14:23.738 --> 14:25.740
[sniffling]

14:30.745 --> 14:32.789
- Stop, now!

14:35.583 --> 14:38.712
Here. John usually
makes this run,

14:38.753 --> 14:40.338
but since he's retired...

14:40.380 --> 14:42.048
- What the hell am I
supposed to do with this?

14:42.090 --> 14:45.176
- Deliver it.
We need a new Milkman.

14:51.933 --> 14:55.061
Hey! Hey! Hey!
[cheering]

14:55.103 --> 14:57.230
That was for San Diego.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.773
- Fuck San Diego.

15:03.153 --> 15:04.362
[car door slams]

15:06.990 --> 15:09.117
- The Milkman
has stabilized.

15:09.159 --> 15:12.245
Doc said he'll be fine,
but the girl--

15:12.287 --> 15:14.831
Couldn't you have
let her in?

15:14.873 --> 15:17.167
- She complicates things.

15:20.086 --> 15:23.423
[laughing] Imagine
what John went through,

15:23.465 --> 15:25.925
driving halfway
across the country,

15:25.967 --> 15:29.554
all to deliver...

15:29.596 --> 15:32.140
this.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.641
Yeah.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.313
- What do you think?

15:38.355 --> 15:41.358
- It's fine.
I ordered pistachio.

15:41.399 --> 15:42.859
Of course, they fucked up
my order.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.736
- I meant about John.
- Oh.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.571
He passed his test,

15:46.613 --> 15:48.698
and Calypso kept
his end of the bargain.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.868
Mostly.
[gags]

15:51.910 --> 15:54.329
Marshmallow. Blech.

15:54.371 --> 15:55.663
- So it's time that
we start prepping him

15:55.705 --> 15:57.874
for his new position?

15:57.916 --> 16:00.085
Not yet,
let him acclimate,

16:00.126 --> 16:02.295
get a feel for
the good life inside.

16:02.337 --> 16:05.131
Then we'll talk
about what comes next.

16:12.514 --> 16:27.445
**

16:40.875 --> 16:42.419
- That's a nice dick.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.758
All right, jerkoff,
it's just me and you.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.428
Now are we gonna work it
out today, or not.

16:55.306 --> 16:56.141
Come on!

16:56.182 --> 16:57.308
Yagh!

16:57.350 --> 16:59.102
Oh, fuck!

16:59.144 --> 17:00.854
This--

17:00.895 --> 17:02.939
[grunting]

17:02.981 --> 17:04.983
Fuck you, fuckin'...

17:05.025 --> 17:06.026
Come on.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.110
Why do you make me
do this to you?

17:07.152 --> 17:08.945
Don't be such
a fuckin' asshole!

17:08.987 --> 17:10.822

[bicycle bell ringing]

[screaming]

17:15.785 --> 17:17.328
Fuckin' bike.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.580
What?!

17:18.621 --> 17:30.008
**

17:30.050 --> 17:32.344
- Good morning, John.
- Hi

17:32.385 --> 17:33.887
[chuckling]

17:33.928 --> 17:35.013
- Hey, what's up, John?

17:36.765 --> 17:38.892
- Hey, John.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.101
- Good morning, John.

17:40.143 --> 17:54.866
**

17:54.908 --> 17:56.451
[laughing]

17:56.493 --> 17:58.411
- Oh my god.
- I'm telling ya.

17:58.453 --> 18:00.914
Look, the weirdest thing
I've ever eaten was an owl.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.040
- No shit?
- Yeah!

18:02.082 --> 18:03.083
- Why?

18:03.124 --> 18:04.501
- I got the midnight
munchies.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.669
You know what
I'm talkin' about!

18:05.710 --> 18:08.171
[laughing]
- You're such a badass, John.

18:08.213 --> 18:11.424
Oh, god, you must have,
like, killed so many people.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.553
- Uh, yeah, yeah.
A few, yeah.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.971
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.890
- Yeah.
[chuckling]

18:18.932 --> 18:21.810
But, like how many?

18:21.851 --> 18:24.396
- Aw, I mean,
I don't keep count, dude.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.189
[laughing]

18:26.231 --> 18:27.774
- He doesn't keep count!

18:27.816 --> 18:30.235
Okay, like I said,
you're a badass.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.862
Oh! You gotta tell 'em
about the clown!

18:32.904 --> 18:34.239
This is so crazy.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.865
I think he had, like,
bondage stuff, I don't know.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.492
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It was a lot of leather

18:37.534 --> 18:39.411
and sweat.
- This guy!

18:39.452 --> 18:40.787
[laughing]

18:40.829 --> 18:42.038
[knocking]

18:45.250 --> 18:46.334
- Hi.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.378
- Hi.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.755
- Diane, right?
- Yeah.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.382
Come in.

18:52.424 --> 18:54.843
It's okay.
I won't bite.

18:56.928 --> 19:00.390
- So, uh, I've never
been set up on

19:00.432 --> 19:01.933
a thing like this before.
- Oh.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.936
- But Chester told me
you're a guard with him.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.605
- You don't remember me?

19:07.647 --> 19:09.607
You do not have clearance
to approach.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.568
- Oh, shit!
Bill's replacement!

19:11.609 --> 19:13.403
- Mm-hmm.
- I didn't even recognize you.

19:13.445 --> 19:15.905
- Well, must be the hair.

19:15.947 --> 19:18.616
- I didn't even
see past the gun.

19:20.785 --> 19:22.245
- Let me get you a drink.

19:22.287 --> 19:23.663
Do you like wine?

19:23.705 --> 19:25.874
- Uh, toilet or sink?

19:25.915 --> 19:28.126
- How about red?

19:28.168 --> 19:29.419
[stuttering]
Yeah?

19:29.461 --> 19:30.337
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:30.378 --> 19:31.171
[knocking]

19:31.212 --> 19:32.589
Oh, that's the pizza.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.382
Would you mind
grabbing that?

19:34.424 --> 19:35.717
- Sure.

19:38.970 --> 19:41.264
- Hey, got a cheese pizza
for you.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.141
- Wow.

19:43.183 --> 19:46.519
I've never been on
the other side of a delivery.

19:46.561 --> 19:48.396
I'm supposed to
give you something, right?

19:48.438 --> 19:50.523
Here you go.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.108
- Bullets.

19:52.150 --> 19:54.611
- Would you prefer gasoline?

19:54.652 --> 19:56.654
- There is cash
right there, dude.

20:01.409 --> 20:03.536
- I hope that makes
a warm fire for you.

20:03.578 --> 20:04.871
And hey, thanks.

20:04.913 --> 20:06.373
I really appreciate
what you went through

20:06.414 --> 20:07.707
to get this here.

20:07.749 --> 20:09.584
- It's not a big deal, man.

20:18.468 --> 20:22.097
- So this is pizza.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.640
- You've never had pizza?

20:23.682 --> 20:26.810
- Oh, my gosh,
you've never had pizza?!

20:26.851 --> 20:28.186
- No.

20:28.228 --> 20:31.189
- I'm honored to be here
for your first time.

20:34.192 --> 20:35.026
- Thanks.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.492
- Good?

20:42.534 --> 20:44.411
- Uh-huh.

20:44.452 --> 20:59.384

**

21:16.735 --> 21:19.529
- I know you're out there.

21:19.571 --> 21:21.948
You don't know
who you're messin' with.

21:25.577 --> 21:26.745
If you're gonna kill me,
do it quick,

21:26.786 --> 21:28.079
you goddamn vulture.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.831
- I'm not a vulture,
you buttmunch.

21:29.873 --> 21:31.666
And I don't
want to kill you.

21:31.708 --> 21:35.545
Your delivery.
I want half.

21:35.587 --> 21:36.921
- I heard of you.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.883
You're the one
who's been robbin' milkmen?

21:39.924 --> 21:42.844
I've scratched my taint
with twigs bigger than you.

21:42.886 --> 21:45.305
[chuckling]
You ain't gettin' shit!

[screaming]

21:52.187 --> 21:53.605

drivin' with your feet.

21:54.939 --> 21:57.233
So, half!

21:57.275 --> 21:59.569
- Fine! It's in the back.

21:59.611 --> 22:01.071
I hope you choke on it!

22:03.073 --> 22:05.116
- It's not for me,
you jag-off.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.618
The insiders have been
runnin' this shit

22:06.659 --> 22:08.078
for far too long.

22:08.119 --> 22:10.121
It's time somebody
shared the wealth.

22:10.163 --> 22:25.095
**

22:32.102 --> 22:33.728
- So tell me,

22:33.770 --> 22:36.314
how is John adjusting?

22:36.356 --> 22:37.816
- He's doin' greet.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.526
Uh, we all get along.

22:39.567 --> 22:40.860
I-I mean I think
me and the guys

22:40.902 --> 22:42.195
would be friends with him
whether or not we had to,

22:42.237 --> 22:43.613
right, fellas?

22:43.655 --> 22:44.447
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

22:44.489 --> 22:45.281
- Mm-hmm.

22:45.323 --> 22:46.825
- And Diane?

22:46.866 --> 22:48.159
- She-she set him up well.

22:48.201 --> 22:50.245
She's pushing
for a second date.

22:50.286 --> 22:51.788
- Good.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.707
Make sure that happens.

22:53.748 --> 22:56.710
I want John
to be happy.

22:56.751 --> 23:00.547
And because I want it,
you should want that, too.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.632
- John is happy.

23:02.674 --> 23:03.800
I mean, he'll--
he'll be ready to drive

23:03.842 --> 23:05.510
for you
any day now.

23:05.552 --> 23:06.970
- Raven.

23:07.012 --> 23:09.097
Just got word that John Doe's
only two blocks away.

[gasping]

23:13.393 --> 23:14.978
[sighing]

23:16.980 --> 23:19.941
[laughing]
- Right? Yeah!

23:19.983 --> 23:22.193
John! You wanna
join us for a beer?

23:22.235 --> 23:24.154
- No thanks, Chester.

23:24.195 --> 23:26.239
I'm leavin'.

23:33.872 --> 23:34.456
- You really wanna leave

23:35.498 --> 23:37.417
after I gave you
everything I promised?

23:37.459 --> 23:40.503
I even heard things
are going swimmingly with Diane.

23:40.545 --> 23:42.756
- How do you know
about Diane?

23:42.797 --> 23:44.299
- It's my job
to know everything.

23:46.968 --> 23:49.346
- [laughing]
- The only thing I don't know

23:49.387 --> 23:52.265
is what else I could
possibly give you.

23:52.307 --> 23:55.435
- Something
you can't give me.

23:55.477 --> 23:56.686
- The girl?

23:56.728 --> 23:59.272
[scoffing]

23:59.314 --> 24:01.691
John, you're seriously gonna
give all of this up

24:01.733 --> 24:05.028
for some chick you knew
for 10 days?

24:05.070 --> 24:06.404
I've had colds
last longer.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.198
- Her name's Quiet.

24:08.239 --> 24:10.325
- No way
that's her real name.

24:10.367 --> 24:13.912
You do know her real name,
don't you?

24:13.953 --> 24:17.665
Also, didn't she shoot you?
- Yeah, that happened.

24:17.707 --> 24:21.461
- John, that doesn't
sound healthy.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.963
Okay, look, if that's
really how you feel,

24:24.005 --> 24:25.882
I will escort you
to the gate myself.

24:25.924 --> 24:28.343
We just have to make
one quick stop first.

24:28.385 --> 24:30.220
Come on.

24:31.846 --> 24:33.932
- [scoffs]

24:33.973 --> 24:38.019
What the fuck is
wrong with you now?

24:38.061 --> 24:39.813
It finally happened.

24:39.854 --> 24:42.065
I'm talking to a car.

24:42.107 --> 24:44.359
I know something
didn't die in you.

24:44.401 --> 24:45.402
Last time that happened,

24:45.443 --> 24:46.986
you smelled like
burnt baby raccoon.

24:47.028 --> 24:48.988
Thank you, by the way.
That was delicious.

24:49.030 --> 24:50.949
- Maybe something shifted

24:50.990 --> 24:53.868
when I slammed into that
Milkman the other week?

24:53.910 --> 24:55.662
Oh, my God, now I'm fucking
asking the car

24:55.704 --> 24:57.122
a God damn question.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.832
That's great.
That's really great.

24:58.873 --> 25:00.500
That's super healthy.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.127
[screams]

25:02.168 --> 25:05.964
Why won't you work,
you rusted piece of shit?

25:07.465 --> 25:09.259
[sighs]

25:11.386 --> 25:12.429
I'm very sorry.

25:12.470 --> 25:14.597
Um, that was very rude.

25:14.639 --> 25:15.765
You did not deserve that.

25:15.807 --> 25:17.142
It's not your fault
that you're rusted.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.768
It's just, we've been
together a month,

25:18.810 --> 25:22.355
and I have no clue
how you work.

25:22.397 --> 25:24.190
Oil goes in your mouth,
and fuel goes up your butt.

25:24.232 --> 25:28.194
Everything in the middle
makes no sense.

25:28.236 --> 25:30.155
[sighs]

25:30.196 --> 25:32.741
I guess I just
keep trying pieces

25:32.782 --> 25:34.284
until I find one that--

25:34.325 --> 25:35.368
- You just try
different pieces

25:35.410 --> 25:38.204
'til you find
the one that fits.

25:38.246 --> 25:41.207
- Fits.

25:41.249 --> 25:43.126
You better not be
fuckin' with me.

25:47.756 --> 25:49.132
[engine turns over]

25:49.174 --> 25:51.843
Aah! Holy shit!
I did it!

25:51.885 --> 25:54.512
I fucking did it!

25:54.554 --> 25:56.264
What the fuck did I do?

25:58.600 --> 26:01.019
- Where are you taking me?

26:01.061 --> 26:03.938
- Here.
- Nice house.

26:03.980 --> 26:06.983
- I'm glad you think so.
It's yours.

26:07.025 --> 26:08.443
- [chuckles]

26:08.485 --> 26:11.029
You think a residential upgrade
is gonna keep me here?

26:11.071 --> 26:14.074
Pass.
- No, John.

26:14.115 --> 26:16.659
This is yours.

26:16.701 --> 26:18.620
This is where you grew up.

26:22.874 --> 26:24.668
- Wait.

26:34.386 --> 26:36.971
I lived here?

26:37.013 --> 26:38.973
- You've got mail.

26:41.976 --> 26:44.187
When I first heard
of John Doe the Milkman,

26:44.229 --> 26:45.355
I did a little digging,

26:45.397 --> 26:47.899
and when I learned
that you had roots here,

26:47.941 --> 26:49.943
I dug some more.

26:49.984 --> 26:51.861
I'm sure you'll have
lots of questions,

26:51.903 --> 26:54.614
and if you stay,
you'll get answers.

26:58.952 --> 27:00.537
- I don't know what name
I was born with

27:00.578 --> 27:02.956
or who I am really.

27:02.997 --> 27:17.929
**

27:17.929 --> 27:18.221
**

27:38.033 --> 27:39.701
- Drive!

27:46.041 --> 27:48.668
- It's just like
I promised you.

27:48.710 --> 27:51.504
I brought you home.

27:51.546 --> 28:02.140
**

28:02.182 --> 28:04.851
- This isn't my home.

28:04.893 --> 28:06.728
It's his,

28:06.770 --> 28:10.106
whatever his name is.

28:10.148 --> 28:12.942
This isn't me anymore.

28:12.984 --> 28:15.362
I found my home
out there with Quiet.

28:17.572 --> 28:19.407
- Hmm.

28:19.449 --> 28:21.201
Wow, I never took you
for such a romantic,

28:21.242 --> 28:23.370
but if that's
your decision...

28:23.411 --> 28:25.663
[sighs] This isn't normally
how I like to do things,

28:25.705 --> 28:29.709
but, hey, I'm flexible.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.378
I have a job for you.

28:31.419 --> 28:33.713
- I'm not gonna be
your Milkman.

28:33.755 --> 28:34.839
- Milkman?

28:34.881 --> 28:36.383
[laughing]

28:36.424 --> 28:38.968
No, those days
for you are long gone,

28:39.010 --> 28:40.929
but you're still a driver.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.430
Best I've ever seen.

28:42.472 --> 28:45.392
You proved that to me when
you made my little run.

28:45.433 --> 28:47.477
See, you passed
the test, John,

28:47.519 --> 28:51.523
and now I need your skills.

28:51.564 --> 28:54.067
There's gonna be
a tournament,

28:54.109 --> 28:56.152
the first of its kind

28:56.194 --> 28:58.780
where the best drivers
from all across the country,

28:58.822 --> 29:03.660
from all walks of life,
are gonna be invited to compete.

29:03.702 --> 29:07.372
See, the tournament
only has one rule:

29:07.414 --> 29:09.916
Survive.

29:09.958 --> 29:14.170
And you better believe who
you face won't play fair.

29:14.212 --> 29:17.007
This is where
you come in, John.

29:17.048 --> 29:21.052
You are my horse,
and I need you to win,

29:21.094 --> 29:24.723
because Calypso is offering
quite a prize.

29:24.764 --> 29:27.392
The winner gets
their heart's desire,

29:27.434 --> 29:30.228
their greatest wish
come true.

29:30.270 --> 29:32.480
You're gonna
help me win, John,

29:32.522 --> 29:35.025
and you're gonna do it
by getting behind the wheel

29:35.066 --> 29:36.860
and turning every
car and contestant

29:36.901 --> 29:38.194
that crosses your path

29:38.236 --> 29:41.406
into nothing but a flaming pile
of twisted metal.

29:41.448 --> 29:44.576
You will drive, John Doe,

29:44.617 --> 29:46.703
and you will win.

29:53.710 --> 29:56.129
- Okay.

29:56.171 --> 29:58.798
Where to next?

29:58.840 --> 30:00.967
[chains rattle]

30:01.009 --> 30:02.677
[tires squealing]

30:02.719 --> 30:17.359
**

30:21.154 --> 30:22.989
- Hey, girl.

30:23.031 --> 30:25.867
I've been dying
to talk to you.

30:25.909 --> 30:28.161
I heard you know
my brother.

30:28.203 --> 30:31.748
He goes by John.

30:31.790 --> 30:46.554
**

31:14.916 --> 31:15.250
[laughter]

31:17.419 --> 31:20.171
- I told you we'd find it,
and we did.

31:20.213 --> 31:22.549
Shangri-fuckin'-la.

31:22.590 --> 31:25.010
- We got everything we need:

31:25.051 --> 31:29.848
Ladies, liquor,
and long dogs.

31:29.889 --> 31:31.099
This is Strawberry.

31:31.141 --> 31:34.019
She's a doctor
and a lawyer.

31:34.060 --> 31:35.353
I met her in a strip club.

31:35.395 --> 31:37.147
- Okay. Okay.
This is Cleopatra.

31:37.188 --> 31:39.482
She, uh, specializes
in French cuisine.

31:39.524 --> 31:40.900
- Ooh-la-la.
- She, uh,

31:40.942 --> 31:42.485
is also a stripper.

31:42.527 --> 31:43.570
I'm thinkin' about
takin' a swim.

31:43.611 --> 31:44.779
What do you guys think?

31:44.821 --> 31:46.239
- No, she'll sink
right to the bottom.

31:46.281 --> 31:47.282
I've tried before.

31:47.323 --> 31:48.241
- [Sweet Tooth]
Good evening.

31:48.283 --> 31:50.577
- Holy shit!
- [roaring]

31:50.618 --> 31:53.663
- Actually,
I have a better idea.

31:53.705 --> 31:57.417
[laughter]

32:05.592 --> 32:06.801
[growls]

32:06.843 --> 32:09.304
- Oh, no! Mike! Aah!

32:09.346 --> 32:11.848
[Sweet Tooth laughing]

32:11.890 --> 32:13.808
[screaming]
