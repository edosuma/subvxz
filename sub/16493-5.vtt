What does that make you, "Old-bies"?

06:00.333 --> 06:02.375
Time Ape isn't a clock or an ape.

06:02.458 --> 06:04.542
He's a trans- chronological being.

You see, while traveling through
the space time continuum,

06:07.333 --> 06:09.917
Dr. Zone was sucked into
a rift of space time

06:10.000 --> 06:12.709
where he met another time
traveler like himself.

06:12.792 --> 06:15.250
But since this being was
not from our dimension,

06:15.333 --> 06:19.709
his appearance would cause any
normal person's head to explode!

06:19.792 --> 06:23.750
So for us to comprehend him, the Time
Ape took the form that we now know.

that would be easier for us to comprehend

08:00.208 --> 08:03.709
The end, question mark.

08:03.792 --> 08:06.250
Or, Dr. Zone's mom knew that, like,

08:06.333 --> 08:08.291
their planet was going to explode.

08:08.375 --> 08:09.208
Implode.

08:09.291 --> 08:11.750
[Melissa] Right, so she wrapped
her babies in those blankets

08:11.834 --> 08:14.417
that babies are always
escaping imploding planets in.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.333
But the get-away rocket
only had room for one baby.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.417
So the other baby was
caught in the implosion

08:22.500 --> 08:23.875
and sucked into a time vortex

08:23.959 --> 08:26.250
that turned him into a
trans-chronological being,

08:26.333 --> 08:28.291
whose appearance would
make our heads explode.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.291
So when he turned into the Time Ape,

08:30.375 --> 08:33.041
it's because he was
already a Time Ape before!

08:33.166 --> 08:34.250
Exactly!

08:34.333 --> 08:35.875
Oh, see, that would make more sense!

08:35.959 --> 08:40.291
And therefore,
Time Ape would be Dr. Zone's brother.

I've already got enough
excitement in my life anyway.

10:28.875 --> 10:31.625
After all, I saw a train
come through our backyard.

10:31.709 --> 10:33.250
But what about the movie?

10:33.333 --> 10:35.750
Eh. Seeing a movie on
opening day is overrated.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.750
Also, clearly, very dangerous.

10:45.375 --> 10:46.542
Just in case.

10:46.625 --> 10:47.709
Nope.

10:47.792 --> 10:49.542
Much better.

10:49.625 --> 10:53.834
Well, Time Ape, once again
we've had the time of our lives.

10:53.917 --> 10:56.959
After all, time is relative!

10:59.458 --> 11:00.667
They are brothers!

11:00.750 --> 11:01.709
She was right!

11:01.792 --> 11:02.834
Newbie!

11:02.917 --> 11:04.667
[chanting newbie]

11:06.208 --> 11:07.667
What happened to the wall?
