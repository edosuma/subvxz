Then after we build the fort,

00:49.966 --> 00:52.051
we'll tear it down
and have a pillow fight!

00:52.135 --> 00:54.471
After that, we'll make
double-fudge chocolate brownies.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.098
Extra-chewy ones? No, extra-chocolaty.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.683
Ooh, extra delicious!

00:58.767 --> 01:02.062
This is going to be the best slumber party
in the history of slumber parties!

01:02.145 --> 01:06.399
Sounds great, Lucky, but my dad's
only out of town for one night.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.068
How are we gonna fit all that in?

01:08.151 --> 01:10.361
You weren't planning on sleeping,
were you?

01:12.906 --> 01:13.907
Hey, Rusty.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.116
- Hi.
- Hi, Pablo.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.161
Looks like we've got
some new houseguests.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.496
Barn guests?

01:19.579 --> 01:20.872
Neigh-bors?

01:20.955 --> 01:22.874
Where did you three beauties come from?

01:22.957 --> 01:26.878
Pretty as a picture, aren't they?
Purebred Arabian mares, all of them.

01:26.961 --> 01:31.257
Known far and wide as the sweetest,
most well-behaved horses you'll find.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.217
Watch this.

01:34.219 --> 01:37.931
Ooh! Good job... you.

01:38.014 --> 01:40.016
-What's her name?
-She doesn't have one.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.602
-Ooh, I'll name her. How--
-And she doesn't need one.

01:42.685 --> 01:45.647
I've got a buyer coming tomorrow.
He'll name 'em if he wants to.

01:45.730 --> 01:48.108
I'll be back in plenty of time
before he gets here.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.943
I'll make sure they're groomed and ready.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.653
Ooh, want me to braid their manes?

01:51.736 --> 01:55.323
All the Arabians at Chica Linda's
last horse show had their manes braided,

01:55.406 --> 01:59.661
- and they looked so beautiful.
- Whoa. Let the mares be.

01:59.744 --> 02:02.038
-I've got them all ready for tomorrow.
-But--

02:02.122 --> 02:03.123
Just do your chores.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.917
If anything comes up,
Rusty and Pablo can take care of it.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.545
Well, sounds like I'd better get
to the depot.

02:09.628 --> 02:12.465
You girls behave and have fun
at that slumber party of yours.

02:12.549 --> 02:13.466
-We will!
-Bye!

02:13.550 --> 02:16.344
Don't worry about a thing, Dad.
I've got it all handled.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.639
Okay, pals, what's the plan?

02:19.722 --> 02:20.974
You take care of your chores,

02:21.057 --> 02:23.726
and me and Abigail will get everything
for the slumber party.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.353
Like candy and chocolate!

02:25.436 --> 02:26.855
And chocolate candy!

02:26.938 --> 02:28.982
-Meet you back here in an hour?
-Perfect!

02:29.065 --> 02:32.068
Or at least this barn
will be perfect when I get done with it.

02:34.737 --> 02:37.657
-That will be all. Thank you.
-Hi, Aunt Cora. Need some help?

02:37.740 --> 02:41.828
Oh, thanks, but it looks like you both
have your hands full already.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.955
Got enough marshmallows for tonight?

02:44.038 --> 02:45.540
Oh, these are for Boomerang.

02:45.623 --> 02:48.376
Are all those magazines full of...

02:48.459 --> 02:49.961
wedding dresses?

02:50.044 --> 02:53.214
Yes, and hopefully one
of them will be perfect for Kate.

02:53.798 --> 02:55.383
We'll see you tonight, girls.

02:55.466 --> 02:58.887
Come on, Abigail, let's grab Pru
and get to the slumber party.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.307
Oh, wow.

03:02.390 --> 03:06.019
Wow, it's so fresh
and clean and spider-less.

03:06.102 --> 03:08.813
I can't believe Pru did all this so fast.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.356
Also, where is Pru?

03:13.943 --> 03:16.613
Pru! The barn looks amazing!

03:16.696 --> 03:18.781
But why are you on the roof?

03:18.865 --> 03:20.033
I saw some loose shingles,

03:20.116 --> 03:23.202
but when I came up here to fix 'em,
I saw how uneven they all were,

03:23.286 --> 03:24.787
so I'm redoing the whole roof.

03:26.497 --> 03:29.125
Didn't your dad just say
to do your regular chores?

03:29.208 --> 03:33.046
Yes. But this is the first time
he's left me in charge of the ramada.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.840
I want to show him I'm ready
for the responsibility.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.259
Then we're going to help.
Where do we start?

03:42.847 --> 03:45.058
I finished-- aah!

03:55.151 --> 03:56.861
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

03:58.988 --> 04:00.448
Hmm...

04:08.748 --> 04:10.875
Come on, pals.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.961
It's double-chocolate fudge brownie time.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.004
- Let's go!
- Onwards, Lucky!

04:15.088 --> 04:16.880
Ooh. All right!

04:16.964 --> 04:19.259
After all this hard work, I'm starved.

04:20.885 --> 04:21.886
Hmm...

04:21.970 --> 04:25.765
Hey, you think her coat could be shinier?
Maybe a quick curry and a brush?

04:25.848 --> 04:27.100
They all look shiny to me.

04:27.183 --> 04:29.477
I'm pretty sure your dad said not
to touch the mares.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.272
He won't mind if he can drive
a harder bargain tomorrow.

04:32.355 --> 04:35.108
After all, the prettier the horse,
the higher her price.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.819
And when I'm done with them,
they're gonna gleam!

04:37.902 --> 04:39.487
But... but... brownies!

04:39.570 --> 04:41.489
Pals, just one last thing,

04:41.572 --> 04:45.410
and then it's all chocolate, pillow fights
and hair braiding. I promise.

04:45.493 --> 04:46.744
-Fine.
-Okay.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.122
Oh! Oh!

04:49.205 --> 04:50.498
Help?

04:50.581 --> 04:51.916
Hello!

04:52.000 --> 04:54.210
I got it. I think.

04:55.586 --> 04:59.215
We'll be right back. You just get ready
to get extra gussied up, Miss...

05:01.217 --> 05:02.552
...Horse.

05:03.344 --> 05:06.306
Miss Horse? That doesn't sound
very Abigail of you, Abigail.

05:06.389 --> 05:07.807
I know, I know!

05:07.890 --> 05:10.852
I've been racking my brain,
but I can't think of names for them.

05:10.935 --> 05:13.313
Why do you think
I've been so stressed all day?

05:13.396 --> 05:14.939
Names, names...

05:15.023 --> 05:16.149
What's a good name?

05:16.232 --> 05:17.942
Come on, Abigail.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.527
Abigail!

05:19.610 --> 05:20.653
No.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.156
I can't think of anything!

05:23.239 --> 05:25.742
I've got nothing.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

05:29.787 --> 05:31.539
No, no, no!

05:31.622 --> 05:33.541
They're supposed to be well-behaved!

05:33.624 --> 05:35.168
What are your names?

05:35.251 --> 05:37.295
Stop! Stop running!

05:37.378 --> 05:39.338
Come on, boy. See those bad horses?

05:39.422 --> 05:41.007
Round 'em up.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.469
- Come back here!
- Come on, Spirit!

05:44.552 --> 05:47.722
They're so dirty now.
Oh, my dad is gonna kill me!

05:48.806 --> 05:52.185
- Good job, Spirit.
- Ugh. Now they all need baths.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.771
I'm sorry. This is gonna take forever.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.355
It's okay, Pru.

05:56.439 --> 05:57.940
The brownies can wait.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.576
Okay, girl, tell me your name.

06:08.993 --> 06:11.204
Tell me. I know you know.

06:11.287 --> 06:13.372
Wait! It's coming to me.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.999
Furfl.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.751
Strwl.

06:16.834 --> 06:19.128
Porpo?

06:19.212 --> 06:20.338
Cruzpo?

06:20.421 --> 06:23.007
M-Mofuzz?

06:23.091 --> 06:25.009
Beeboop? Bisley?

06:25.093 --> 06:27.095
-I think Abigail's broken.
-Flarsburg?

06:30.098 --> 06:31.599
Aw, she's so pretty--

06:31.682 --> 06:34.602
all clean and sparkly
like a beautiful horsey princess.

06:37.438 --> 06:40.358
I've heard horses can get stuck
on their reflections,

06:40.441 --> 06:42.151
but I've never actually seen it.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.905
Your dad's going to be so impressed.

06:48.699 --> 06:50.493
Come on, Pru.

06:53.704 --> 06:58.209
Pals, I give you The Towering Treat Tepee!

06:58.292 --> 07:00.419
It's a slumber-party paradise!

07:00.503 --> 07:01.504
Just wait.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.631
First, we're gonna start with a makeover.

07:03.714 --> 07:06.759
Maybe I should go check on the mares
one more time, just in case?

07:06.843 --> 07:09.053
Pru, the mares are fine.

07:09.137 --> 07:12.849
The ramada is cleaner than it's ever been,
and you worked so hard.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.434
Don't you deserve a little fun?

07:14.517 --> 07:15.768
-But what about--
-Wait.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.646
Before you answer, have a marshmallow.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.858
Okay, you win.

07:23.025 --> 07:24.485
Pillow fight!

07:29.740 --> 07:31.451
And then we'll make our own yo-yos.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.453
But when do we get to the hair braiding?

07:33.536 --> 07:36.080
- What you doing?
- Wedding dresses.

07:36.164 --> 07:39.083
I didn't know the general store
even had this many magazines.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.586
Ooh, I like this one with the tassels.

07:41.669 --> 07:43.045
Or that one with the tassels!

07:43.129 --> 07:44.881
You can't go wrong with tassels.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.049
The more, the better! See?

07:47.758 --> 07:49.844
That's a beautiful dress, Abigail,

07:49.927 --> 07:52.889
but tassels don't really suit me.

07:52.972 --> 07:53.890
Oh.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.476
The shape of this one
is rather lovely, though.

07:56.559 --> 07:57.602
Can I see, Kate?

07:57.685 --> 07:58.936
Hmm...

08:01.314 --> 08:02.607
Mm-hmm!

08:02.690 --> 08:04.275
Oh, here!

08:04.358 --> 08:06.777
- What do you girls think of this?
- It's nice.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.404
-Pretty!
-Needs tassels.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.491
Mm... it's not quite right,

08:11.574 --> 08:13.451
although I do like the beading.

08:13.534 --> 08:14.994
So pretty!

08:15.077 --> 08:18.706
Beads. Okay, beads.

08:18.789 --> 08:21.417
There's nothing in this one.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.712
Not to worry.
We still have dozens more to look through.

08:24.795 --> 08:27.340
Ooh! Mine's gonna be so elegant.

08:27.423 --> 08:29.675
I know exactly
what mine's gonna look like.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.302
Very nice, Pru.

08:31.385 --> 08:33.846
Just wait till you see
the tack I'm gonna design to go with it.

08:33.929 --> 08:37.099
Oh, I think this one is just stunning.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.727
- A green wedding dress?
- Sea foam.

08:39.809 --> 08:42.605
It's the height of sophistication
in the city right now.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.523
Ooh.

08:43.606 --> 08:46.067
You'd look like
a sparkly after-dinner mint.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.985
Maybe...

08:48.069 --> 08:50.154
The neckline is nice, I guess.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.949
- The lace on this one is very pretty.
- Lace...

08:53.032 --> 08:55.159
But the rest isn't quite right.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.953
None of these are right.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.038
I'm never going to find my perfect dress!

08:59.830 --> 09:02.500
Well,
then we'll just have to keep looking.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.751
- Yeah!
- Don't give up.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.378
Maybe a fringe?

09:05.461 --> 09:07.755
It's okay, really.

09:07.838 --> 09:10.591
There are plenty of lovely dresses here.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.969
I'm sure one of them will be fine,

09:13.052 --> 09:16.264
even if it's not
exactly what I dreamed of.

09:16.347 --> 09:18.599
Thanks, everyone.

09:18.683 --> 09:19.850
Have a good night.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.562
Poor Kate.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.564
I hope she finds something she likes.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.065
Not likely.

09:26.148 --> 09:27.984
None of these even have fringe.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.278
Oh. Hmm...

09:36.701 --> 09:37.535
Huh?

09:46.877 --> 09:49.088
That one over there
is Leo, the lion.

09:49.171 --> 09:50.590
- See?
- Ooh.

09:50.673 --> 09:54.218
Look at that one. It's like a fish-goat.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.596
I'm gonna call it Gergen.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.347
No, that's not right.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.600
-Capricorn?
-Ugh. That name's even worse.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.896
Okay, just one more.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.236
Is that the sound of you finally relaxing?

10:12.320 --> 10:13.237
Yep.

10:13.321 --> 10:16.240
I'm not even gonna think
about the ramada until morning.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.576
-Whoo-hoo!
-Whoo-hoo! Yay!

10:36.844 --> 10:38.429
It's morning.

10:38.512 --> 10:41.265
Okay, I'm gonna go check on the mares,

10:41.349 --> 10:43.559
unless you want to come with me and help.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.353
No?

10:47.938 --> 10:49.357
Last chance.

11:00.993 --> 11:01.827
Wha--

11:05.164 --> 11:06.332
Uh...

11:06.957 --> 11:08.084
The mares are gone!

11:08.167 --> 11:09.377
Panda bear!

11:10.378 --> 11:12.546
Oh, no. Lucky, wake up!

11:15.591 --> 11:17.593
Ha! Got you!

11:18.969 --> 11:20.805
Wait. What's going on?

11:20.888 --> 11:22.598
I don't know what happened.

11:22.681 --> 11:26.435
They must have, uh, licked their way out.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.313
My dad will never trust me again!
What am I gonna do?

11:29.397 --> 11:30.898
Everything's gonna be okay.

11:30.981 --> 11:34.693
Your dad's train doesn't get in until ten.
We still have time to round them up.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.988
We better hurry. What if they get
all the way out onto the frontier?

11:38.072 --> 11:39.407
Then we'll never find them.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.953
I mean, this'll be easy.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.913
Come on, pals, let--

11:47.206 --> 11:48.457
Good day, children.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.918
I'm here to see about some Arabian mares.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.962
Uh, where is Mr. Granger?

11:53.045 --> 11:54.713
Eep! You're early!

11:54.797 --> 11:56.757
I mean... hello.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.552
Yes, I took an earlier train.
Is Mr. Granger here?

11:59.635 --> 12:01.262
I'd like to see the stock.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.557
Well, he's...

12:05.015 --> 12:06.183
I mean...

12:06.809 --> 12:07.935
The horses...

12:08.018 --> 12:11.063
Mr. Granger will be here in an hour.
Can you come back then?

12:11.147 --> 12:12.565
I see.

12:12.648 --> 12:16.444
Well, a rancher in Cannon City
has some Arabians, too.

12:16.527 --> 12:19.196
I'll have a look at hers,
and if they aren't right for me,

12:19.280 --> 12:20.656
perhaps I'll be back.

12:20.739 --> 12:22.074
Uh, good day, children.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.242
Wait!

12:25.244 --> 12:29.331
-We'll show you the mares ourselves.
-But, Lucky, the mares are gone.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.376
Gone to have breakfast in a field nearby.

12:32.460 --> 12:36.172
Tall, fresh, green grass--
only the best for our horses.

12:38.507 --> 12:40.634
Pru and I will round them up for you
in a jiffy!

12:40.718 --> 12:42.178
-Right, Pru?
-Right.

12:42.261 --> 12:45.848
-Well, I suppose, since I'm already--
-Have you been to Miradero before?

12:45.931 --> 12:47.766
-Uh, no.
-Well, you're in luck.

12:47.850 --> 12:51.854
Abigail here is the best tour guide
our fair town has to offer.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.857
She'll show you the sights
while we get the mares.

12:54.940 --> 12:55.900
She will?

12:55.983 --> 12:58.777
- Stall him.
- Put him in the horses' stable?

12:58.861 --> 13:02.364
Show him the town for as long as you can.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.408
Abigail is a Miradero native.

13:04.492 --> 13:05.618
That's me!

13:05.701 --> 13:08.204
And a thorough town tour
is a Miradero tradition

13:08.287 --> 13:09.872
as old as the hills.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.165
Oh, that's unnecessary.

13:11.248 --> 13:14.460
I'm perfectly fine waiting here,
and I don't need a guide.

13:14.543 --> 13:16.420
Pishposh!

13:16.504 --> 13:18.214
Come on, there's so much to see.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.424
-But I--
-I said "pishposh."

13:20.508 --> 13:23.219
Now, this way. Don't dawdle!

13:23.302 --> 13:26.347
Miradero has been described
by one citizen as splendiferous.

13:26.430 --> 13:27.556
That citizen was me!

13:27.640 --> 13:30.434
-Why aren't we taking the road?
-Who takes roads anymore?

13:30.518 --> 13:31.560
They're all dirty.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.103
Okay, let's start the tour.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.438
See this dogwood tree?

13:34.522 --> 13:36.815
My brother fell out of it
and broke his arm.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.442
And this jacaranda tree?

13:38.526 --> 13:41.403
My brother fell out of it
and broke his leg.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.364
Oh, or was it the other way around?

13:45.533 --> 13:47.826
I'm gonna be so grounded.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.828
Take it all in, Chica Linda.

13:49.912 --> 13:53.457
This might be the last time
we see sunshine in months.

13:53.541 --> 13:54.458
Years?

13:54.542 --> 13:56.835
We won't let that happen, I promise.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.671
Any idea where they went, Spirit?

14:07.137 --> 14:08.347
There they are.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.391
Thank goodness. Let's go get them.

14:10.474 --> 14:11.850
Shh.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.525
Hi, ladies!

14:19.608 --> 14:20.734
Get 'em!

14:27.116 --> 14:29.076
Yes!

14:29.159 --> 14:30.619
Whoa!

14:30.703 --> 14:33.080
Okay, okay, having second thoughts here.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.379
Help!

14:41.005 --> 14:42.965
- Yeah!
- Come on, Lucky!

14:43.048 --> 14:44.884
-Faster!
-Yeah!

14:46.802 --> 14:48.721
Hold on. Aah!

14:48.804 --> 14:51.640
Whoa! Whoa, hold on!

14:51.724 --> 14:53.267
Whoa!

14:54.602 --> 14:55.895
Aah!

14:55.978 --> 14:57.062
I've got it!

14:59.398 --> 15:01.025
Oh!

15:01.108 --> 15:02.735
Aah!

15:02.818 --> 15:04.403
Hold on!

15:04.486 --> 15:07.406
I... Ah, I'm trying!

15:08.198 --> 15:10.159
- Go, Lucky!
- Aah!

15:10.242 --> 15:12.077
Oh!

15:13.412 --> 15:15.831
- Go, Lucky!
- Go, Pru!

15:15.915 --> 15:17.625
-Yay!
-Go, horse!

15:17.708 --> 15:19.543
Whoa, girl!

15:19.627 --> 15:20.669
Ow!

15:22.713 --> 15:23.923
One down.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.257
Look!

15:25.341 --> 15:28.135
And here's where I dropped a whole jar
of jelly beans.

15:28.218 --> 15:30.888
It was a dark time for me.

15:30.971 --> 15:34.350
Oh, listen to me going on and on.
Tell me about yourself.

15:34.433 --> 15:37.144
-Do you have any kids?
-I have two sons.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.355
-What are their names?
-John and Joe.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.857
Well, those aren't
very horsey names at all!

15:44.777 --> 15:46.695
And a-one, two, three, four!

15:50.240 --> 15:51.742
Isn't he great?

15:52.868 --> 15:55.371
Take it away, Señor Carrots!

15:57.581 --> 16:01.585
Little girl, are we going to see
those horses anytime soon?

16:01.669 --> 16:02.586
-Or I'm--
-Shh!

16:02.670 --> 16:05.798
No talking during Señor Carrots' solo!

16:23.065 --> 16:24.525
You hear it too, right?

16:36.704 --> 16:37.621
What is it, boy?

16:43.502 --> 16:45.004
-What?
-How?

16:45.087 --> 16:46.255
Why?

16:46.338 --> 16:48.215
Don't worry. We got this.

16:48.298 --> 16:49.925
Let's just get up there.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.432
You're going to love this.

16:56.515 --> 16:57.850
They're world famous.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.351
Or at least town famous.

16:59.435 --> 17:03.522
-Do you like it?
-Uh, yes, it's quite flavorful.

17:10.570 --> 17:12.823
Eep.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.157
Now try this one.

17:14.241 --> 17:16.660
You had chocolate-vanilla-strawberry.

17:16.743 --> 17:19.246
This one is strawberry-chocolate-vanilla.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.329
Totally different.

17:20.414 --> 17:24.877
Yes, this is equally flavorful,
but, really, I've had enough.

17:24.960 --> 17:28.756
Now, I must ask you to either take me
to those Arabians

17:28.839 --> 17:30.257
or take me to the train depot.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.676
Whew. Arabians it is.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.971
I just have to show you the fountain.
It's on the way, sort of.

17:36.972 --> 17:39.683
Okay, just one more mare to go.

17:39.767 --> 17:41.560
We can totally pull this off.

17:52.780 --> 17:53.906
Agh!

18:04.792 --> 18:07.669
-I don't think we're gonna find her.
-We can't give up.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.713
Lucky, my dad's gonna be back any second.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.924
I can't believe I messed up this bad.

18:12.007 --> 18:15.344
All I wanted to do was show him
I could handle the responsibility.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.513
He already knows you're responsible.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.306
Well, he won't think so now.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.735
So, Cora, I was thinking,

18:31.819 --> 18:35.322
the sea foam one really is... chic.

18:35.405 --> 18:39.034
It's not what I imagined,
but I think it'll do.

18:39.827 --> 18:43.330
Kate, a wedding dress
is supposed to be special,

18:43.413 --> 18:46.041
and that's hard to find in a magazine.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.127
Go on.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.762
Oh! Did you make this?

18:58.846 --> 19:01.348
I couldn't get the sleeves
exactly how you described,

19:01.431 --> 19:03.183
and the skirt's a little long, but--

19:03.267 --> 19:05.561
Cora, it's perfect!

19:05.644 --> 19:09.356
I couldn't imagine anything better!

19:09.439 --> 19:10.566
Thank you.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.360
Oh, you're going to make
such a lovely bride.

19:13.443 --> 19:14.778
Now, we mustn't wrinkle it.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.447
Here, I'll put it back in the box.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.913
Think we found our missing mare.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.042
Uh-oh.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.589
-Oh, Kate, here!
-Save the dress!

19:33.672 --> 19:35.007
Oh!

19:35.090 --> 19:36.925
Got you now.

19:38.635 --> 19:40.220
Oh, come on!

19:44.474 --> 19:45.726
Aah!

19:52.900 --> 19:53.734
Aah!

19:57.279 --> 19:58.822
Oh, no!

20:01.283 --> 20:03.410
I have an idea.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.914
Okay, girl, who wants to look
at her reflection?

20:08.916 --> 20:09.958
Come on.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.419
Here you go.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.631
There's a pretty girl.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.175
Come on, come on.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.719
You did it!

20:25.182 --> 20:26.934
Oh, thank heavens!

20:28.310 --> 20:29.937
Come on.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.439
There you go. Keep walking.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.071
We're too late!

20:39.154 --> 20:41.281
And here we are, at the barn.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.450
What's going on? Where's Pru?

20:43.533 --> 20:44.660
What do we do?

20:44.743 --> 20:46.453
Oh, I'm dead meat!

20:46.536 --> 20:47.663
I'm trying to think!

20:47.746 --> 20:50.707
Listen, are you Mr. Granger?

20:50.791 --> 20:54.086
No, I'm Abigail!

20:54.169 --> 20:55.087
Yes, sir.

20:55.545 --> 20:57.673
Oh, I thought you were talking to me.

20:58.131 --> 20:59.258
It's over.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.884
We can't give up yet, Pru.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.554
Spirit, what are you doing?

21:06.348 --> 21:08.684
The swinging door! Let's go!

21:08.767 --> 21:10.185
We can still make it.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.688
Hurry!

21:12.771 --> 21:14.022
Uh...

21:14.106 --> 21:15.691
I can explain everything.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.901
Y-you see, the mares are...

21:18.777 --> 21:19.778
...here!

21:19.861 --> 21:20.737
Yep.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.365
Morning, Dad.

21:23.448 --> 21:24.533
Pru, you okay?

21:24.616 --> 21:26.910
I'm great.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.913
But, boy, currying a horse
is so much harder...

21:29.997 --> 21:31.331
...than it looks.

21:31.415 --> 21:32.457
Nice.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.501
Fine animals, Mr. Granger.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.128
Most impressive.

21:36.211 --> 21:37.546
I'll take the lot.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.931
I never thought I'd be relieved
to say goodbye to such pretty horses.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.517
They were nothing but trouble,
tricking us like that.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.312
And when your dad showed up,
I was sure we were toast.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.230
Wait! Nobody move.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.149
-What?
-Shh, shh.

21:57.232 --> 22:00.319
Trouble, Trixie, and Toast!

22:00.402 --> 22:02.821
-Yes!
-Still got it, Abigail.

22:02.904 --> 22:06.325
...800, 900, 3,000.

22:06.408 --> 22:10.370
I love it
when I get to count so high.

22:10.454 --> 22:13.165
Rusty, Pablo, the mares looked great.

22:13.248 --> 22:14.333
Good work.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.752
Actually, that was all Pru.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.754
Was it, now?

22:18.837 --> 22:20.464
That's my girl.

22:20.547 --> 22:21.882
I'm proud of you.

22:21.965 --> 22:24.092
Well, I did have a little help.

22:24.176 --> 22:27.137
You know, I need to head to Silverlode
on business next month.

22:27.220 --> 22:31.308
How'd you like it if I left you in charge
of the ramada for a whole week?

22:32.642 --> 22:35.854
Oh...
