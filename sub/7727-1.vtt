02:06.484 --> 02:09.953
Oh, Father.

02:17.078 --> 02:23.250
Father Merrin, in the valley
of the shadow of death...

02:23.251 --> 02:25.969
be at my side.

03:08.213 --> 03:10.881
Why me?

03:10.882 --> 03:13.967
I heal the sick.

03:13.968 --> 03:16.512
Why me?

04:05.395 --> 04:08.780
Okay, 8:00 tomorrow.

04:51.941 --> 04:54.242
Debbie.

04:54.736 --> 04:57.321
Debbie, can you hear it?

04:57.322 --> 04:59.239
No?

04:59.240 --> 05:01.958
I'll turn it up.

05:02.243 --> 05:06.129
Debbie, Debbie.

05:07.874 --> 05:09.958
You can hear it?

05:09.959 --> 05:13.178
Debbie. Debbie.

05:16.424 --> 05:18.550
Debbie.

05:18.551 --> 05:21.470
Mother's late. She's never on time.

05:21.471 --> 05:24.473
- Hi.
- Hi, Regan! You're right on time.

05:24.474 --> 05:26.983
- For once.
- Yeah.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.928
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.061
What's happening?

06:03.179 --> 06:05.564
Not much.

06:05.682 --> 06:09.226
- Any dreams?
- No dreams.

06:09.227 --> 06:11.403
Okay.

06:14.857 --> 06:20.028
- Look, I'm just wasting your time.
- Why do you say that?

06:20.029 --> 06:24.791
- Well, you know why I come here.
- Well, you tell me.

06:24.951 --> 06:29.830
- To make my mom feel better.
- Explain that, would you?

06:29.831 --> 06:33.417
- She feels guilty.
- Why?

06:33.418 --> 06:37.004
Divorce, her career...

06:37.005 --> 06:39.598
away all the time.

06:39.716 --> 06:44.720
Regan? Why don't you tell me
the truth? Don't you trust me?

06:44.721 --> 06:46.847
But I do. I do.

06:46.848 --> 06:51.435
You keep saying you don't
remember that time in Washington.

06:51.436 --> 06:54.362
I don't know if I believe you.

06:55.064 --> 07:01.661
I remember being very sick and
having nightmares, and that's all.

07:04.449 --> 07:07.701
Those bad dreams
are still inside you.

07:07.702 --> 07:11.046
There's nothing wrong with me.

07:13.249 --> 07:18.011
Regan? Regan? I want
to show you something.

07:18.338 --> 07:24.259
You see this? This is a
machine we can use together.

07:24.260 --> 07:31.016
It can put us in a state of hypnosis.
You'd be very relaxed and comfortable.

07:31.017 --> 07:36.563
And then we could look at those bad
dreams together and understand them.

07:36.564 --> 07:40.901
And dissolve them.
You wouldn't be alone, Regan.

07:40.902 --> 07:46.073
- How do you feel about that?
- I don't think you're ready for it.

07:47.450 --> 07:50.160
What does that mean?

07:50.161 --> 07:54.631
You're the doctor. You explain it.

08:05.051 --> 08:07.769
Follow me, please.

08:30.451 --> 08:36.798
Cardinal Jaros, may I present Father
Philip Lamont, Society of Jesus?

08:41.629 --> 08:46.633
Would you care to explain your
refusal to accept this task?

08:46.634 --> 08:52.347
I should be relieved from all pastoral
responsibilities. I'm not worthy.

08:52.348 --> 08:56.685
Father, I have not asked you
to perform another exorcism.

08:56.686 --> 09:03.358
I simply requested that you investigate
the death of Father Merrin.

09:03.359 --> 09:08.488
You have performed exorcisms.
You knew Father Merrin.

09:08.489 --> 09:12.534
Furthermore, you were
exposed to his teachings.

09:12.535 --> 09:18.465
I cannot think of anyone more
qualified for this assignment.

09:20.334 --> 09:24.095
Philip, it's so good to see you.

09:24.338 --> 09:30.886
Merrin's, uh, reputation is in jeopardy.
His writings have been impounded.

09:30.887 --> 09:36.391
I'm not surprised. No one in the
church wants to hear about the devil.

09:36.392 --> 09:41.396
Satan has become an embarrassment
to our progressive views.

09:41.397 --> 09:45.275
Merrin was rather more
extreme, I'm afraid.

09:45.276 --> 09:51.406
He argued that the power of evil
threatens to overthrow God himself.

09:51.407 --> 09:55.494
So they found a heresy
to nail him to.

09:55.495 --> 10:00.624
Well, uh, many of the theological
college believe that...

10:00.625 --> 10:04.211
he died at the hands of the devil...

10:04.212 --> 10:07.464
during that, uh, American exorcism.

10:07.465 --> 10:12.677
Some, and they are close to
the pontiff, go so far as to suggest...

10:12.678 --> 10:17.307
that he was a Satanist.
At the end, I mean.

10:17.308 --> 10:21.144
Perhaps Father Merrin took
a path no one could follow.

10:21.145 --> 10:24.105
But how he inspired us, Philip!

10:24.106 --> 10:29.953
Here. Remember,
Christ is hard to follow too.

10:31.531 --> 10:37.452
We were young. Today,
wherever I look, I see only evil.

10:37.453 --> 10:40.672
God has fallen silent.

10:44.252 --> 10:48.672
I cannot move to safeguard
Merrin's testament...

10:48.673 --> 10:54.678
until all the facts about his
last exorcism are clearly known.

10:54.679 --> 10:57.681
You will conduct the investigation.

10:57.682 --> 11:02.894
You will act discreetly in all
confidence, reporting to me alone.

11:02.895 --> 11:04.980
But I'm not worthy!

11:04.981 --> 11:09.242
You are a soldier of Christ.
Make yourself worthy.

11:21.455 --> 11:28.177
I want you to concentrate hard on
the name of this color. All right?

11:39.765 --> 11:42.726
- Gene Tuskin, Father.
- Lamont, doctor.

11:42.727 --> 11:44.861
Come on in.

11:47.106 --> 11:53.153
- Liz, what does he want?
- How would I know, Regan?

11:53.154 --> 11:56.331
He's here about me, isn't he?

11:56.741 --> 11:59.250
Why do you say that?

12:01.203 --> 12:06.791
What about the coroner's report,
the testimony? The file's that thick.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.460
Yes, I know.

12:08.461 --> 12:13.923
Unfortunately, it sheds very little
light on Father Merrin's death.

12:13.924 --> 12:17.510
I was hoping to question the girl.

12:17.511 --> 12:20.730
- Why don't you sit down?
- Thank you.

12:22.975 --> 12:27.604
Regan suffered a severe
trauma by that experience.

12:27.605 --> 12:32.200
I think the exorcism
made the problem worse.

12:32.777 --> 12:35.820
You must know that three people died.

12:35.821 --> 12:40.283
Regan's guilt was so great,
she repressed everything.

12:40.284 --> 12:44.371
I'm sorry, Father. I can't
let you question her.

12:44.372 --> 12:49.918
The shock of recall could
result in self-punishment.

12:49.919 --> 12:53.262
I couldn't rule out suicide.

12:54.298 --> 12:59.310
You have a heavy responsibility:
the care of her soul.

12:59.595 --> 13:05.358
The care of her mind and her
body is my responsibility, Father.

13:08.062 --> 13:11.823
You realize what you're
up against, don't you?

13:17.530 --> 13:20.957
- What am I up against, Father?
- Evil.

13:24.120 --> 13:28.665
Mental illness. That's what
we're up against here.

13:28.666 --> 13:32.836
Or the casualties of a
diseased society. Evil is not...

13:32.837 --> 13:38.016
Evil is a spiritual being,
alive and living.

13:38.384 --> 13:43.972
Perverted and perverting, weaving
its way into the very fabric of life.

13:43.973 --> 13:46.975
- Sorry to disturb you.
- What is it?

13:46.976 --> 13:51.813
I've changed my mind. I'd like
to try that machine after all.

13:51.814 --> 13:54.899
- Fine.
- Could we try it now?

13:54.900 --> 13:57.902
I'm sorry.
I won't intrude any longer.

13:57.903 --> 14:01.781
It's okay, Father.
You can stay if you'd like.

14:01.782 --> 14:06.669
Uh, Regan, this is Father Lamont.
Regan MacNeil.

14:06.871 --> 14:09.706
- Hello.
- How do you do?

14:09.707 --> 14:13.543
Well, we can do it
tomorrow then, Regan. Okay?

14:13.544 --> 14:16.679
Father, maybe you can help me.

14:18.007 --> 14:20.516
- All right, Regan?
- Good.

14:20.801 --> 14:26.931
Experiments show that thought
can transmit across distances.

14:26.932 --> 14:31.269
- Here he is, causing a spoon to bend.
- Sharon.

14:31.270 --> 14:34.063
- Not on a stage...
- Look, I can do it.

14:34.064 --> 14:39.986
...but under laboratory controls and
observed by skeptical scientists.

14:39.987 --> 14:43.239
- It's easy.
- Good God, Regan.

14:43.240 --> 14:47.327
...they seem to defy natural laws.
How can that be?

14:47.328 --> 14:51.664
Oh, look, you fool.
You believe everything!

14:51.665 --> 14:53.833
Oh, wait, wait.

14:53.834 --> 14:58.387
...but is merely an illusion:
a projection of the mind.

14:58.714 --> 15:04.177
These are EEG biofeedback electrodes.
They pick up any brain frequency.

15:04.178 --> 15:07.347
They're integrated
with these strobes...

15:07.348 --> 15:11.184
to bring two altered states
into synchronization.

15:11.185 --> 15:13.561
- Are you ready, Regan?
- Yes.

15:13.562 --> 15:17.524
We're going to do this
just the way I showed you.

15:17.525 --> 15:20.910
Now, I want you to relax your arms.

15:27.451 --> 15:32.171
Now, I want you to concentrate
on the strobe light.

15:33.791 --> 15:36.551
Deeply, relax.

15:37.461 --> 15:41.764
Just let yourself go
and look at the light.

15:55.437 --> 16:00.199
Now, I want you to relax and
make your tone go deeper.

16:02.278 --> 16:05.121
Listen to your tone.

16:05.406 --> 16:07.623
Deeper.

16:14.081 --> 16:16.632
Deeper, Regan.

16:20.045 --> 16:22.847
Can you hear me, Regan?

16:23.132 --> 16:24.799
Yes.

16:24.800 --> 16:29.804
When you hear the alarm buzzer,
you will wake up and feel fine...

16:29.805 --> 16:35.101
but you will remember nothing
that happened. Do you understand?

16:35.102 --> 16:36.769
Yes.

16:36.770 --> 16:43.326
Very good. Now, do you remember
your room in Washington?

16:44.028 --> 16:45.737
Yes.

16:45.738 --> 16:50.033
- Can you see your room?
- No.

16:50.034 --> 16:53.202
Then I want you to go deeper.

16:53.203 --> 16:57.665
Go deeper into your memory
until you can see your room.

16:57.666 --> 17:01.552
Make your tone go deeper,
and you will see it.

17:03.714 --> 17:06.015
Deeper.

17:06.425 --> 17:10.185
Deeper, Regan. Deeper.

17:12.431 --> 17:14.773
Can you see it now?

17:18.311 --> 17:20.070
Yes.

17:24.693 --> 17:30.281
I want to come down and be with you.
Do you remember how to help me?

17:30.282 --> 17:31.741
Yes.

17:31.742 --> 17:35.119
Good. Bring me down to where you are.

17:35.120 --> 17:39.548
You and I will obey the commands
that Liz and Father Lamont give us.

17:39.583 --> 17:42.293
Do you understand?

17:42.294 --> 17:44.220
Yes.

17:44.880 --> 17:47.924
I'm going to turn my light on now.

17:47.925 --> 17:52.311
And you will help me bring
my tone down to yours.

18:07.111 --> 18:09.328
Can you hear me, Gene?

18:10.114 --> 18:12.081
Yes.

18:12.116 --> 18:14.158
Relax then.

18:14.159 --> 18:21.082
And let yourself come
down deeper and deeper...

18:21.083 --> 18:24.051
to meet my tone.

18:24.545 --> 18:26.379
Relax.

18:26.380 --> 18:31.100
Deeper.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.645
Good.

18:34.763 --> 18:40.526
- Doctor, can you see Regan's room?
- Yes.

18:44.857 --> 18:49.527
Regan, do you remember the time
Father Merrin came up to you?

18:49.528 --> 18:51.287
Yes.

18:52.698 --> 18:56.959
Regan, you will now
respond to Father Lamont.

19:03.500 --> 19:07.170
- Regan?
- Yes?

19:07.171 --> 19:10.006
That time in the room...

19:10.007 --> 19:14.310
try and remember Father
Merrin just before he died.

19:14.470 --> 19:20.524
- We're alone.
- Is his heart strong? Resolved?

19:21.018 --> 19:23.194
He is praying.

19:23.812 --> 19:27.740
- Is he in pain?
- Yes.

19:29.193 --> 19:34.663
- Is he casting out the unclean spirit?
- He is praying.

19:35.324 --> 19:39.919
And you, Regan. What are you doing?

19:57.012 --> 19:59.230
Dr. Tuskin?

20:01.809 --> 20:03.401
Gene?

20:03.519 --> 20:06.612
Gene, wake up!

20:06.980 --> 20:12.068
- What's wrong with Gene?
- Her heart, it's fibrillating!

20:12.069 --> 20:16.405
Put that on. You've gotta go
back and find her right now.

20:16.406 --> 20:22.044
I know where she is. Help me to find
and reach her. Liz, put this on.

20:25.916 --> 20:31.637
- Liz, help me to reach Dr. Tuskin.
- All right, we'll try.

20:36.218 --> 20:39.478
Relax deeply, watch the light.

20:48.897 --> 20:53.742
That's good.
Let yourself go down deeper.

20:54.736 --> 20:58.372
Listen to your tone,
and make it go deeper.

20:59.616 --> 21:01.584
Deeper.

21:02.244 --> 21:05.921
Deeper. Deeper.

21:50.125 --> 21:51.334
Get thee hence!

21:51.335 --> 21:54.629
She's mine, always.

21:54.630 --> 21:56.297
No!

21:56.298 --> 21:58.390
Always.

22:00.719 --> 22:02.887
Always.

22:02.888 --> 22:05.314
Father, please. Bring her back.

22:08.227 --> 22:11.487
Father, can you hear me?

22:20.239 --> 22:24.458
Father, please. Bring her back.

23:28.348 --> 23:30.232
In God's name!

23:34.938 --> 23:38.574
Tell Gene she will not remember.

23:39.067 --> 23:44.121
Gene, you will not remember.
Gene, you will not remember.

24:00.797 --> 24:03.591
- What happened?
- Are you all right?

24:03.592 --> 24:07.970
Your heart was fibrillating.
I don't know what went wrong.

24:07.971 --> 24:10.514
I couldn't bring you out of it.

24:10.515 --> 24:16.528
Father Lamont had to go into synch to
contact you. He brought you out of it.

24:17.272 --> 24:22.234
- He told you not to remember.
- Do you remember?

24:22.235 --> 24:24.411
No.

24:28.408 --> 24:31.043
Do you remember?

24:35.082 --> 24:37.299
Come on, Regan.

24:37.834 --> 24:40.427
I'll be right back.

24:46.343 --> 24:49.637
I bet they're pretty drawings.
How are you?

24:49.638 --> 24:54.225
Want me to draw a picture?
What would you like me to draw?

24:54.226 --> 24:57.945
- A house.
- A house?

24:58.063 --> 25:01.615
Why do you want a house?
A house is dull.

25:01.900 --> 25:06.078
How about if I draw you a face?

25:15.205 --> 25:18.290
- How do you feel?
- All right. You?

25:18.291 --> 25:19.959
Oh, I'm fine.

25:19.960 --> 25:25.631
The psychological effects of synching
with another mind last a long time.

25:25.632 --> 25:27.975
It's very powerful.

25:30.053 --> 25:35.850
- Did you see what you wanted to see?
- Evil is gaining.

25:35.851 --> 25:40.813
- Father Merrin was killed.
- By Regan?

25:40.814 --> 25:45.776
She didn't. It did.
It wasn't the mind of a child.

25:45.777 --> 25:50.289
It was horrible. Utterly horrible.

25:51.032 --> 25:53.208
And fascinating.

25:54.953 --> 25:59.582
We don't know all that much
about synchronized hypnosis yet.

25:59.583 --> 26:05.087
What you saw could have been
a dream, a fantasy, a hallucination.

26:05.088 --> 26:07.173
Not a memory at all.

26:07.174 --> 26:13.228
Names, just names. Better to see
the face than hear the names.

26:18.435 --> 26:22.646
I can't have a discussion now.
I have to do my rounds.

26:22.647 --> 26:24.440
Doctor, what I saw...

26:24.441 --> 26:28.619
I'm sorry. It'll have
to wait till tomorrow.

26:28.695 --> 26:30.954
Hi, Amy.

26:31.948 --> 26:37.419
Father, Regan did a picture of you.

26:39.498 --> 26:41.290
What's it mean?

26:41.291 --> 26:45.761
It's you. She draws well.

26:46.087 --> 26:48.263
The flames.

26:49.841 --> 26:52.017
Flames.

27:05.315 --> 27:10.736
Doctor. Doctor, the flames.
They're getting bigger.

27:10.737 --> 27:14.573
- We've got to put the fire out.
- Take it easy.

27:14.574 --> 27:19.703
It's probably some post-flashing.
It's an aftereffect of hypnosis.

27:19.704 --> 27:23.499
No, you've got to help me.
We may be too late.

27:23.500 --> 27:28.804
- Where you going?
- You've got to help me. Her picture.

27:34.928 --> 27:40.816
- Come on, Father. Give me a break.
- No, there's a fire somewhere.

27:55.615 --> 27:58.959
I'll get the fire department.

28:21.766 --> 28:24.192
Okay.

29:09.856 --> 29:15.911
You kids can go on in now.
Everything's okay. Go on in now.

29:17.864 --> 29:20.916
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:22.786 --> 29:25.204
- Thank you.
- I got it.

29:25.205 --> 29:28.707
Regan's picture, the flames.
She warned us.

29:28.708 --> 29:33.170
That contact between us came
about through your machine.

29:33.171 --> 29:36.674
Whatever it was,
it saved the children.

29:36.675 --> 29:41.929
It took a machine. The work you're
doing is incredible. Miraculous!

29:41.930 --> 29:46.350
The machine is a device to
penetrate pathological states.

29:46.351 --> 29:51.313
No, you're talking about therapy.
You don't realize the importance!

29:51.314 --> 29:55.651
As much as I enjoy recognition,
you're overstating it.

29:55.652 --> 30:00.781
Don't you understand that I was
face to face with the evil in her?

30:00.782 --> 30:05.911
Your machine has proved that there's
an ancient demon within her!

30:05.912 --> 30:09.715
We must fight it, we must help her!

30:11.167 --> 30:16.179
It's all okay now.
You can go on in, all right?

30:17.382 --> 30:21.343
I was trying to help her
before you came along.

30:21.344 --> 30:27.024
You must let me synch with Regan!
And that way, you can control things.

30:28.685 --> 30:31.145
Well, I just don't know.

30:31.146 --> 30:35.323
Listen, you can go in now.
It's all clear, okay?

30:40.405 --> 30:42.406
I know what concerns you.

30:42.407 --> 30:47.161
That Regan will suddenly remember.
That she'll go into shock.

30:47.162 --> 30:51.081
I believe that Regan already
remembers everything.

30:51.082 --> 30:54.293
The deaths, the possessions,
the demons.

30:54.294 --> 31:01.266
She's out there, all alone,
trying to deal with this thing.

31:01.342 --> 31:03.143
All by herself.

31:08.808 --> 31:13.779
Regan. Regan.

31:15.857 --> 31:22.070
Regan.

31:22.071 --> 31:26.450
Come, Regan.

31:26.451 --> 31:29.995
We're going flying.

31:29.996 --> 31:34.174
Far, far away.

34:33.054 --> 34:35.563
Regan.

34:37.516 --> 34:39.549
Regan?

34:43.447 --> 34:45.480
Regan?

34:46.442 --> 34:49.159
Oh, good morning, Sharon.

34:57.578 --> 34:59.913
What got you up so early?

34:59.914 --> 35:04.384
The doves woke me.
I guess they were hungry.

35:04.669 --> 35:09.381
I may not be here when you get home.
Can you let yourself in?

35:09.382 --> 35:12.592
- Will you be all right?
- Where are you going?

35:12.593 --> 35:16.096
- Washington. I'll be back soon.
- Washington?

35:16.097 --> 35:20.559
Some things your mother didn't
do before going on location.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.736
Oh, okay.

35:23.646 --> 35:27.115
Wanna fly, babe? There you go, up.

36:10.443 --> 36:13.236
I'm grateful to you for coming.

36:13.237 --> 36:17.199
Mrs. MacNeil wants me
to help you while I can.

36:17.200 --> 36:20.786
She would do anything
for Father Merrin.

36:20.787 --> 36:24.464
She believes he gave
his life for Regan.

36:28.211 --> 36:31.346
Are they gonna make him a saint?

36:31.672 --> 36:35.725
The world doesn't
want any more saints.

36:35.885 --> 36:39.270
This is not an official investigation.

36:52.610 --> 36:57.364
When Father Merrin arrived,
how did he prepare himself?

36:57.365 --> 36:59.241
Did he pray?

36:59.242 --> 37:03.670
They couldn't explain it,
the police, could they?

37:16.259 --> 37:19.427
Did Father Merrin
ever name the demon?

37:19.428 --> 37:21.187
No.

37:21.389 --> 37:23.898
It knew him, though.

37:25.143 --> 37:29.320
- How do you know that?
- It called his name.

37:40.241 --> 37:43.827
Did the demon seem to
expect Father Merrin?

37:43.828 --> 37:45.795
Yes.

37:47.039 --> 37:49.966
It feared him, I think.

38:01.762 --> 38:03.521
Was, uh...

38:04.265 --> 38:07.275
Was Father Merrin afraid?

38:10.104 --> 38:13.323
You'd better see where it happened.

38:17.945 --> 38:21.865
What was her condition when
Father Merrin saw her?

38:21.866 --> 38:24.618
Hideous. That evil face.

38:24.619 --> 38:29.122
- I couldn't bear to be near her after.
- You're with her now.

38:29.123 --> 38:34.169
Two years I stayed away. Two haunted
years, going out of my mind.

38:34.170 --> 38:40.008
And all the time I longed to see her.
Finally, I came back and found that...

38:40.009 --> 38:43.887
when I'm with her is the
only time I'm at peace.

38:43.888 --> 38:48.441
Why would that be?
I can't understand. It frightens me.

38:49.852 --> 38:53.271
Have you tried a
psychiatrist or a priest?

38:53.272 --> 38:57.909
- I'm talking to one now, aren't I?
- I'm not here for you.

39:00.655 --> 39:02.413
There.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.041
In there.

39:10.539 --> 39:14.334
Praying. Have you tried praying?

39:14.335 --> 39:16.094
Prayer?

39:59.130 --> 40:04.892
I pray for the soul of Father
Merrin, who died in this room.

40:05.052 --> 40:10.724
And for Sharon, who was touched
by the shadow of evil.

40:10.725 --> 40:13.234
And for myself.

40:13.853 --> 40:15.945
For myself.

40:24.780 --> 40:29.326
- Next week then, Frank, okay?
- Is there any point going on?

40:29.327 --> 40:33.413
Hey. I'll be in there fighting.

40:33.414 --> 40:36.549
Just as long as you are.

40:42.340 --> 40:43.965
- Hello.
- Hello.

40:43.966 --> 40:46.351
Come on in.

40:49.472 --> 40:51.556
Do you, uh...?

40:51.557 --> 40:55.477
- Do you have children of your own?
- Yes, I do. Two.

40:55.478 --> 40:58.229
A boy and a girl.

40:58.230 --> 41:01.316
I'd like to spend
more time with them.

41:01.317 --> 41:04.778
Must be difficult, with all
your responsibilities.

41:04.779 --> 41:09.082
Not to mention the complications
of being divorced.

41:12.203 --> 41:15.505
You seem to manage.
Your heart is good.

41:16.999 --> 41:19.509
It's hard to live alone.

41:21.587 --> 41:25.139
Don't you ever need a woman, Father?

41:26.384 --> 41:28.601
Yes.

41:33.599 --> 41:36.309
Telling secrets?

41:54.954 --> 41:58.206
Do you remember dreaming
of Father Merrin?

41:58.207 --> 41:59.874
Yes.

41:59.875 --> 42:02.677
Can you see him now?

42:03.254 --> 42:05.596
Yes.

42:06.006 --> 42:08.141
Where is he?

42:14.974 --> 42:20.228
It was long ago when I was
studying the holy men of Africa.

42:20.229 --> 42:23.440
This boy, this young boy...

42:23.441 --> 42:25.700
has very special powers.

42:26.444 --> 42:30.405
They need his help
against the locust swarm.

42:30.406 --> 42:33.074
But perhaps this swarm comes...

42:34.285 --> 42:36.043
because of the boy.

42:36.787 --> 42:41.257
Does great goodness
draw evil upon itself?

42:50.593 --> 42:54.554
Now, Regan, Father Lamont
is hypnotized too.

42:54.555 --> 42:57.515
I want you to bring him down to you.

42:57.516 --> 42:59.809
Tell him what to do.

42:59.810 --> 43:01.444
Father Lamont?

43:02.563 --> 43:04.113
Yes?

43:05.566 --> 43:07.450
Call me.

43:08.486 --> 43:10.036
Regan.

43:55.282 --> 43:59.669
I am Pazuzu!

44:01.664 --> 44:04.048
Pazuzu!

44:06.794 --> 44:10.304
Call me by my dream name.

44:14.260 --> 44:15.852
Call me.

44:16.136 --> 44:18.855
Pazuzu.

44:19.265 --> 44:22.608
King of the spirits of the air!

44:23.018 --> 44:25.061
Pazuzu!

44:25.062 --> 44:28.072
King of the evil spirits of the air!

44:29.275 --> 44:32.318
Spirits of the air!

45:10.941 --> 45:12.775
All-powerful God!

45:12.776 --> 45:17.030
You gave power to your apostles
to pass through dangers!

45:17.031 --> 45:18.748
Give us strength!

45:24.371 --> 45:27.924
No. God!

46:02.409 --> 46:04.327
Fear not!

46:04.328 --> 46:06.663
We are safe inside!

46:06.664 --> 46:10.375
Even Pazuzu with all his legions...

46:10.376 --> 46:13.844
cannot transgress
this holiest of places.

46:16.173 --> 46:19.809
Get thee hence, Satan!

46:20.636 --> 46:23.562
Be uprooted!

46:24.181 --> 46:27.608
Be expelled from
this creature of God!

46:27.935 --> 46:31.904
I command you to the depths of hell!

46:51.083 --> 46:53.084
- Merrin defeated you.
- No!

46:53.085 --> 46:57.088
In his own place of power,
he gained a little time.

46:57.089 --> 47:02.301
It was because the boy was a healer
that you attacked. Now I see.

47:02.302 --> 47:05.263
- But Merrin saved him!
- Never!

47:05.264 --> 47:08.599
I could claim Kokumo even now.

47:08.600 --> 47:11.894
- I'll show you power.
- He's still alive!

47:11.895 --> 47:16.741
- Where is he?
- Shall I take you to him?

47:17.151 --> 47:18.609
Yes.

47:18.610 --> 47:21.328
Are you sure?

47:22.906 --> 47:25.082
Show me.

47:33.751 --> 47:36.919
Come fly the teeth of the wind.

47:36.920 --> 47:40.306
Share my wings.

49:10.722 --> 49:13.724
- What was it?
- A leopard.

49:13.725 --> 49:17.027
He jumped at me.
The boy's still alive.

49:18.272 --> 49:20.398
He frightened Pazuzu.

49:20.399 --> 49:24.118
- Do you remember anything?
- Was it in Africa?

49:25.362 --> 49:27.363
Why do you say that?

49:27.364 --> 49:31.876
It was like what I saw at
the Natural History Museum.

49:33.078 --> 49:38.340
- But you weren't supposed to remember.
- I know.

49:39.710 --> 49:44.597
- Okay, Regan, that's all for today.
- Okay.

49:58.770 --> 50:04.442
Pazuzu showed me that boy. He's a man
now, in a strange mud city in Africa.

50:04.443 --> 50:06.819
Perhaps I can find him.

50:06.820 --> 50:11.749
He has a power over evil.
Regan recognized one of those places.

50:11.950 --> 50:16.871
But she told us it was something
she remembered from the museum.

50:16.872 --> 50:18.956
Let me ask her.

50:18.957 --> 50:23.802
Just a minute. Take it easy.
I want to take a look at you.

50:43.815 --> 50:45.616
Hi.

50:46.860 --> 50:50.454
Hi. Are you waiting
for Doctor Tuskin?

50:52.074 --> 50:55.084
She's very nice, isn't she?

50:56.703 --> 50:59.463
What's the matter with you?

51:13.178 --> 51:18.691
I'm autistic.

51:19.476 --> 51:21.735
How do you mean?

51:23.021 --> 51:28.409
I'm withdrawn.

51:30.112 --> 51:33.114
I can't talk.

51:33.115 --> 51:35.992
But you're talking now.

51:35.993 --> 51:39.295
Yes, you are. I can hear you.

51:42.207 --> 51:46.468
- You can hear me?
- Sure!

51:55.095 --> 51:57.013
What's...

51:57.014 --> 51:58.856
the matter with you?

51:59.641 --> 52:02.026
I was possessed by a demon.

52:03.770 --> 52:06.280
Oh, it's okay. He's gone.

52:07.524 --> 52:12.445
Dr. Tuskin would like Sandra
to visit her voice therapy class.

52:12.446 --> 52:16.457
Hey, Mom. You know
what happened to her?

52:17.909 --> 52:20.794
You're talking!

52:21.705 --> 52:23.630
Talking!

52:24.916 --> 52:29.086
Can you hear me, Mother?

52:29.087 --> 52:32.473
She's talking!

52:32.716 --> 52:35.718
- God....
- Call Gene.

52:35.719 --> 52:38.304
Are you all right?

52:38.305 --> 52:42.274
Mother, it's all right.

52:44.853 --> 52:47.897
- What is it?
- Regan's got Sandra talking!

52:47.898 --> 52:50.941
- What?
- I've got to take her home!

52:50.942 --> 52:54.278
Her father's got to
hear before she stops!

52:54.279 --> 52:58.866
- She's not going to stop.
- No, don't stop, baby, no!

52:58.867 --> 53:02.703
- Keep talking!
- Come on in my office.

53:02.704 --> 53:08.501
No! Her father would never forgive me.
I've got to take her home!

53:08.502 --> 53:12.505
All right, take her home.
Liz, you go with them.

53:12.506 --> 53:14.723
Come on.

53:15.383 --> 53:17.935
What did you do?

53:18.303 --> 53:21.972
Nothing. I just started
talking to her.

53:21.973 --> 53:27.528
First she was talking inside,
and then she started talking outside.

53:28.355 --> 53:33.776
Gene, do you think I could start
helping some of your other kids?

53:33.777 --> 53:40.249
You know, Regan, it's very dangerous
to fool with other people's heads.

53:40.367 --> 53:43.327
Sandra seems to be all right...

53:43.328 --> 53:45.496
but don't try that again.

53:45.497 --> 53:47.506
- Until...
- Until what?

53:48.375 --> 53:52.010
Well, until you're older.

53:52.337 --> 53:54.338
Okay.

53:54.339 --> 53:56.974
Well, there's Sharon. Bye!

53:58.927 --> 54:03.814
Don't tell Sharon because she'll
just call Mom and worry her. Okay?

54:04.641 --> 54:05.850
Gene.

54:05.851 --> 54:10.229
- I don't want to hear any speculation.
- She entered her mind!

54:10.230 --> 54:14.650
- Let's stick to science.
- Don't hide behind science.

54:14.651 --> 54:19.196
Listen, I'm responsible for Regan
while her mother's away.

54:19.197 --> 54:24.827
- You stay away from her! Cut it out!
- You must fight that demon inside her!

54:24.828 --> 54:28.205
- It keeps her from spiritual power.
- Demons?

54:28.206 --> 54:32.126
We make our own, up here.
You're obsessed with the idea!

54:32.127 --> 54:35.754
I'm not! I'm fascinated,
but I know the dangers.

54:35.755 --> 54:39.675
Father Merrin was afraid
he'd slip into admiration.

54:39.676 --> 54:43.020
How about adulation?

55:23.678 --> 55:26.605
Hello, Father.

55:27.849 --> 55:31.193
How did you know I was coming here?

55:31.603 --> 55:33.687
Well, I didn't...

55:33.688 --> 55:35.989
for sure.

55:38.902 --> 55:41.620
I'm not allowed to talk to you.

55:42.239 --> 55:44.615
- Doctor's orders.
- Oh.

55:47.452 --> 55:49.495
- Father?
- Mm?

55:49.496 --> 55:55.175
- Do priests believe in ESP?
- Some do.

55:55.585 --> 56:02.258
A French priest thought we'd all come
together in some sort of telepathy.

56:02.259 --> 56:08.097
A kind of world-mind in which
everybody would share.

56:08.098 --> 56:11.558
When is that supposed to happen?

56:11.559 --> 56:14.152
I don't know.

56:14.271 --> 56:19.984
Father Merrin believed that, with
modern research, it could happen soon.

56:19.985 --> 56:24.154
I mean the kind of research
Dr. Tuskin is doing.

56:24.155 --> 56:27.708
But if it happens
before we're ready...

56:29.160 --> 56:35.632
we may find ourselves pointing in
the wrong direction, toward Satan.

56:37.294 --> 56:40.012
Look, Father.

56:43.049 --> 56:45.642
That's it!

56:46.261 --> 56:49.271
That's where Father
Merrin fought Pazuzu.

56:50.849 --> 56:53.775
You remember Father Merrin?

56:55.645 --> 56:56.854
Yes.

56:56.855 --> 56:59.823
What else do you remember?

57:00.442 --> 57:02.318
Everything.

57:02.319 --> 57:05.037
Aren't you afraid?

57:07.532 --> 57:11.501
I wish I could tell you
not to be, but I can't.

57:12.495 --> 57:17.132
Why wasn't that man with
the leopard afraid of Pazuzu?

57:17.500 --> 57:20.052
I don't know.

57:20.628 --> 57:25.682
- I'll try to find out.
- His name is Kokumo.

57:32.307 --> 57:35.275
Kokumo....

57:36.728 --> 57:42.157
If he can teach me how
he has survived Pazuzu...

57:44.235 --> 57:47.371
I'll come back and let you know.

57:49.657 --> 57:52.076
I must go to Africa right away!

57:52.077 --> 57:55.962
If I can find this man
Kokumo, it will prove...

57:56.081 --> 57:58.791
that the exorcisms were valid.

57:58.792 --> 58:00.626
But more than that...

58:00.627 --> 58:06.048
remember how Merrin prophesied that
new men would arise to purge evil?

58:06.049 --> 58:11.095
They may already be among us.
Kokumo could be one of them.

58:11.096 --> 58:15.857
I saw him in a vision.
I saw his power over evil.

58:16.351 --> 58:21.563
I've asked you to investigate
the exorcisms of Father Merrin...

58:21.564 --> 58:26.693
not to step into his shoes.
You are in dire need of prayer.

58:26.694 --> 58:30.706
- I suggest you make a retreat!
- Why not an advance?

58:30.949 --> 58:37.212
Lamont, you are in open defiance of
the church! I beg you to reconsider!

58:37.414 --> 58:42.126
I have no choice but to relieve
you of your assignment.

58:42.127 --> 58:45.295
You will refrain from
any further action.

58:45.296 --> 58:48.682
We'll speak again after your retreat.

59:50.778 --> 59:53.330
Thank you.

01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:41.948
I am in mortal sin...

01:02:41.949 --> 01:02:45.160
disobedience, pride...

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:47.788
but evil overwhelms us!

01:02:47.789 --> 01:02:53.510
I had to disobey!

01:03:15.942 --> 01:03:17.609
Where is she?

01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:21.871
She's on the roof.
She's always there.

01:03:28.037 --> 01:03:31.047
I can't lock her up.

01:03:47.849 --> 01:03:52.436
- I wish you'd help Father Lamont.
- What do you mean?

01:03:52.437 --> 01:03:55.238
He needs your help.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.734
How can I help him? I don't know how.

01:03:58.735 --> 01:04:01.286
Yes, you do.

01:04:01.612 --> 01:04:04.406
Regan, what are you talking about?

01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:10.662
Well, you know. Going into synch,
trying to reach him like that.

01:04:10.663 --> 01:04:13.999
But you told me he's in Africa.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.043
When you're in synch, it's different.

01:04:17.044 --> 01:04:20.672
I mean, it doesn't
matter where you are.

01:04:20.673 --> 01:04:22.758
You can find them.

01:04:22.759 --> 01:04:24.843
You know...

01:04:24.844 --> 01:04:27.145
help them.

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:31.266
Is that why you haven't
been coming to see me?

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:36.321
- Because I won't let you go into synch?
- Yes.

01:04:40.067 --> 01:04:42.786
I can't.

01:04:49.786 --> 01:04:53.838
I have to do what I
think is best for you.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:01.755
Is there anyone who would
remember Father Merrin?

01:05:01.756 --> 01:05:05.725
Perhaps the abbot. I can ask him.

01:05:20.316 --> 01:05:24.027
He knew Father Merrin.
He says he was very holy.

01:05:24.028 --> 01:05:27.205
Did he know Kokumo?

01:05:30.535 --> 01:05:35.547
Merrin came up here once
with a boy who was very sick.

01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:39.251
There was an accident.

01:05:39.252 --> 01:05:42.170
A wind, what did he say...?
A devil wind.

01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:45.557
And a monk fell to his death.

01:05:45.716 --> 01:05:51.763
The big wind raised much dust,
and the body was never found.

01:05:51.764 --> 01:05:55.567
They searched all over, everywhere.

01:06:00.064 --> 01:06:05.160
He didn't fall there. He bounced
on that ledge and fell there.

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:08.079
I'll show you!

01:06:17.874 --> 01:06:19.966
Be careful!

01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:24.721
Wait! Wait for me!

01:07:30.863 --> 01:07:32.530
Over there!

01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:35.875
In the cleft of that rock over there.

01:08:00.685 --> 01:08:05.939
- How did you know the body was here?
- He was killed by the demon Pazuzu!

01:08:09.276 --> 01:08:11.786
Pazuzu?

01:08:12.279 --> 01:08:15.331
I flew with Pazuzu in a trance!

01:08:19.453 --> 01:08:24.249
It's difficult to explain.
I was under hypnosis.

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:28.219
No, Father! Please wait!

01:08:31.131 --> 01:08:33.683
Stop, Father, wait!

01:08:36.136 --> 01:08:38.345
Father!

01:08:38.346 --> 01:08:39.939
Please!

01:08:41.058 --> 01:08:42.608
No!

01:08:42.727 --> 01:08:46.362
Father Abbot! Listen to me!

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:50.899
He will not speak to
a devil-worshiper!

01:08:50.901 --> 01:08:53.745
I am not a devil-worshiper!

01:10:09.772 --> 01:10:13.991
Please don't drug me.
Don't put me under, Gene.

01:10:14.902 --> 01:10:17.821
I'm okay now.

01:10:17.822 --> 01:10:22.283
- It'll make you sleep.
- But it will stop me from dreaming.

01:10:22.284 --> 01:10:25.837
Maybe that will be good for a while.

01:10:30.417 --> 01:10:33.294
But he needs me.

01:10:33.295 --> 01:10:35.346
I've got to find him.

01:10:36.257 --> 01:10:39.892
You'll be fine. You'll be just fine.

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:44.814
You're trying to kill my....

01:10:45.975 --> 01:10:48.985
My soul.

01:11:03.951 --> 01:11:07.871
A Muslim city with mud walls, golden.

01:12:04.261 --> 01:12:07.805
Mud city with golden walls?
Sounds like Jepti.

01:12:07.806 --> 01:12:11.684
- You know it?
- I know every holy place in Africa.

01:12:11.685 --> 01:12:14.020
Religion's my business.

01:12:14.021 --> 01:12:19.692
Plastic saints, icons,
Buddhas, voodoo gris-gris....

01:12:19.693 --> 01:12:23.738
Edwards' my name.
Ecumenical Edwards, they call me.

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:27.416
Philip Lamont, archeologist.

01:12:28.244 --> 01:12:31.379
It's nice to know you, Father.

01:12:49.723 --> 01:12:51.808
What now?

01:12:51.809 --> 01:12:53.776
Locusts!

01:12:54.687 --> 01:12:57.146
Spraying for locusts!

01:12:57.147 --> 01:13:00.650
This is the traditional
route of the plague!

01:13:00.651 --> 01:13:05.788
They think they can
stop them with DDT!

01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:10.251
- I've flown this route before!
- When was that?

01:13:12.037 --> 01:13:13.913
It was...

01:13:13.914 --> 01:13:16.841
It was on the wings of a demon!

01:13:20.713 --> 01:13:24.140
Did he take you to Jepti?

01:13:24.341 --> 01:13:27.268
Yes, he did.

01:14:19.104 --> 01:14:20.821
Kokumo?

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:28.120
Kokumo? No, no.

01:14:36.914 --> 01:14:38.422
Kokumo?

01:15:05.859 --> 01:15:10.037
Kumo? Kumo?

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:31.976
- Kokumo. Kokumo.
- Kokumo.

01:17:39.805 --> 01:17:42.682
Almighty God...

01:17:42.683 --> 01:17:45.017
help me.

01:17:45.018 --> 01:17:48.145
I must find Kokumo.

01:17:48.146 --> 01:17:54.618
I have resisted. I have
not called on Pazuzu.

01:17:55.445 --> 01:17:57.955
Help me.

01:18:00.033 --> 01:18:02.334
Call me.

01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:06.922
Regan.

01:18:09.835 --> 01:18:13.596
Call me by my dream name.

01:18:18.385 --> 01:18:21.520
Call me.

01:18:24.141 --> 01:18:29.695
Pazuzu, prince of the evil spirits
of the air, take me to Kokumo.

01:18:30.397 --> 01:18:39.538
Kokumo. Kokumo.

01:18:39.906 --> 01:18:42.416
Kokumo.

01:18:43.619 --> 01:18:46.462
Kokumo.

01:18:47.122 --> 01:18:53.594
Kokumo.

01:18:54.713 --> 01:18:58.007
Kokumo.

01:19:19.071 --> 01:19:24.500
I call upon you in the name
of Father Lankester Merrin.

01:19:26.703 --> 01:19:29.080
How did you find me?

01:19:29.081 --> 01:19:33.676
I saw you in the mind of a girl
who was possessed by Pazuzu.

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:39.264
- She is still in danger of dreams.
- How can I help her?

01:19:41.968 --> 01:19:44.512
Which girl would you help?

01:19:44.513 --> 01:19:49.274
The one possessed by Pazuzu or
the one held by Father Merrin?

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:53.187
You must pluck out her evil heart...

01:19:53.188 --> 01:19:56.732
but Pazuzu has brushed
you with his wings.

01:19:56.733 --> 01:19:59.735
You called on Pazuzu to reach me.

01:19:59.736 --> 01:20:03.572
You've lost faith in your God.
You do not believe.

01:20:03.573 --> 01:20:08.285
I do believe! I'll do anything
to help Regan! Anything!

01:20:08.286 --> 01:20:11.463
Then prove your faith. Cross over.

01:20:16.503 --> 01:20:20.973
My faith is in Jesus Christ, reborn.

01:20:22.342 --> 01:20:26.103
Prove it. Cross over!

01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:29.390
Step out of your despair.

01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:33.694
If Pazuzu comes for you,
I will spit a leopard.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:33.879
Can I help you?

01:21:36.166 --> 01:21:39.510
I fell. I failed!

01:21:41.379 --> 01:21:45.466
The heat, perhaps.
Come inside, it's cooler.

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:48.052
- Who are you?
- My name is Kokumo.

01:21:48.053 --> 01:21:51.555
- Did you know Father Lankester Merrin?
- Yes.

01:21:51.556 --> 01:21:55.059
When I was young, in Ethiopia.
Wonderful man.

01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:59.647
He died while exorcising the
demon Pazuzu from a young girl.

01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:03.818
- Were you ever....?
- Possessed by Pazuzu?

01:22:03.819 --> 01:22:06.153
That's what my mother
used to tell me.

01:22:07.364 --> 01:22:10.032
- Locusts?
- Yes!

01:22:10.033 --> 01:22:12.034
Let me show you!

01:22:12.035 --> 01:22:17.047
This is one of the main control
stations in equatorial Africa.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:22.261
The key factor is the
brushing of the wings.

01:22:22.879 --> 01:22:24.964
When it is dry...

01:22:24.965 --> 01:22:29.134
the grasshoppers go their
own way, happy individuals.

01:22:29.135 --> 01:22:33.055
When a heavy rain hatches
them in large numbers...

01:22:33.056 --> 01:22:37.643
they crowd together. Their wings
brush against each other.

01:22:37.644 --> 01:22:41.029
The agitation transforms them.

01:22:44.985 --> 01:22:49.371
Here, you see them
in their various forms.

01:23:03.712 --> 01:23:09.049
Most importantly, the brushing of
the wings changes their personality.

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:14.897
They become a destructive, voracious,
marauding swarm, with a single mind.

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:22.321
A locust mind, if you will.

01:23:31.239 --> 01:23:36.911
The evil swarm sweeps over the earth,
possessing all that it touches.

01:23:36.912 --> 01:23:40.881
Evil breeding evil by contact.

01:23:41.833 --> 01:23:46.086
Is there no hope once the
wings have brushed you?

01:23:46.087 --> 01:23:48.339
We try.

01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:50.799
With the help of science.

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.393
Look at this young female.

01:23:53.970 --> 01:23:58.599
She has been evolved to resist
the brushing of the wings.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.976
At least, that is our hope.

01:24:00.977 --> 01:24:04.613
We like to call her the Good Locust.

01:24:06.524 --> 01:24:10.486
Her children will be our
agents in the swarm.

01:24:10.487 --> 01:24:12.696
Breaking the chain reaction.

01:24:12.697 --> 01:24:17.326
Remaining forever
happy-go-lucky grasshoppers.

01:24:17.327 --> 01:24:20.087
Let us pray it succeeds.

01:24:21.331 --> 01:24:23.882
The Good Locust?

01:25:11.506 --> 01:25:15.559
- Where do you think you're going?
- It's okay.

01:25:40.368 --> 01:25:43.370
I can't get you out of the bath.

01:25:45.665 --> 01:25:48.508
Oh, I lost the soap!

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:55.257
You got me all wet!

01:25:55.258 --> 01:25:58.969
Call back tomorrow.
You got me all wet, look!

01:26:02.474 --> 01:26:04.232
Hello?

01:26:07.479 --> 01:26:09.237
When?

01:26:12.817 --> 01:26:15.619
Does Dr. Tuskin know?

01:26:17.072 --> 01:26:18.655
Well, where is the doctor?

01:26:19.866 --> 01:26:22.292
Hold on, that could be Regan.

01:26:27.332 --> 01:26:29.091
You!

01:26:30.502 --> 01:26:34.713
It's all your fault.
Regan's sick. You stirred it up.

01:26:34.714 --> 01:26:38.675
She's left the hospital.
God knows where she is!

01:26:38.676 --> 01:26:42.054
- I have to see her.
- You have some nerve!

01:26:42.055 --> 01:26:45.974
Please. I can help her.
Only I can help her...

01:26:45.975 --> 01:26:48.143
Leave us alone!

01:26:48.144 --> 01:26:52.898
We don't wanna hear about
demons or God or anything!

01:26:52.899 --> 01:26:54.950
Just get out of here!

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.653
They put you in a hospital.

01:27:39.654 --> 01:27:42.789
Dr. Tuskin doesn't understand.

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:51.131
- Did you find the man with the leopard?
- I did.

01:27:53.168 --> 01:27:56.761
Did he tell you how to fight Pazuzu?

01:27:56.963 --> 01:27:59.473
He told me...

01:27:59.591 --> 01:28:03.435
good and evil are
struggling within you.

01:28:04.429 --> 01:28:06.563
We must fight it.

01:28:08.183 --> 01:28:10.734
I brought this with me.

01:28:11.978 --> 01:28:14.279
The synchronizer?

01:28:15.773 --> 01:28:18.658
Why don't you phone the police?

01:28:20.695 --> 01:28:22.362
No.

01:28:22.363 --> 01:28:25.540
Gary? Linda?

01:28:25.742 --> 01:28:29.286
Get your things.
I'll drop you at Miss Billing's.

01:28:29.287 --> 01:28:31.330
That's no fair, Mom.

01:28:31.331 --> 01:28:35.250
- I know, but I have to.
- What are you gonna do?

01:28:35.251 --> 01:28:37.844
Find her myself.

01:28:37.921 --> 01:28:40.138
And him too.

01:29:09.535 --> 01:29:12.246
- Do you remember Sandra?
- Yes.

01:29:12.247 --> 01:29:14.965
She's still talking.

01:29:15.667 --> 01:29:20.053
You have a great gift.
Keep it from evil.

01:29:35.395 --> 01:29:38.947
Pazuzu will brush me with his wings.

01:29:39.274 --> 01:29:41.866
Don't be afraid.

01:29:42.068 --> 01:29:45.412
Father Merrin will help us.

01:29:59.335 --> 01:30:01.545
All right, Regan.

01:30:01.546 --> 01:30:05.015
I'm ready. Bring me down.

01:30:07.885 --> 01:30:10.437
He is with me.

01:30:11.472 --> 01:30:13.648
Come down.

01:30:14.392 --> 01:30:17.152
Down, Father.

01:30:17.603 --> 01:30:20.238
To meet me.

01:30:41.210 --> 01:30:44.921
You're dying, Merrin, dying!

01:30:44.922 --> 01:30:49.017
And your hopes die with you!

01:30:57.977 --> 01:31:03.523
Not only Kokumo, but others like him,
began to appear in the world.

01:31:03.524 --> 01:31:06.109
I found them where I could...

01:31:06.110 --> 01:31:09.663
and tried to protect
them against evil.

01:31:11.783 --> 01:31:16.753
So Satan has sent Pazuzu
to destroy this goodness.

01:31:16.829 --> 01:31:18.705
Why me?

01:31:18.706 --> 01:31:20.840
I heal the sick.

01:31:24.754 --> 01:31:28.507
Philip, you must take my place.

01:31:28.508 --> 01:31:35.105
She is precious, and I
entrust her to you.

01:32:10.466 --> 01:32:13.593
Father? Fa... Father?

01:32:13.594 --> 01:32:19.649
Father? Father? Father?

01:32:20.685 --> 01:32:22.652
What's...?

01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:30.577
Father, wait! Father,
where are you going?

01:32:32.572 --> 01:32:34.948
- Why would they come here?
- The synchronizer.

01:32:34.949 --> 01:32:36.199
The what?

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:40.495
- It's gone! She's way ahead of us.
- I know she is.

01:32:40.496 --> 01:32:44.507
- Any news?
- Regan's taken the synchronizer.

01:32:55.011 --> 01:32:57.262
Father.

01:32:57.263 --> 01:32:59.314
See me.

01:32:59.724 --> 01:33:02.275
Please, see me.

01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:39.813
Gene, it's her. Line two.

01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:46.019
- Regan?
- Gene, look, I took the synchronizer.

01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:49.022
I'm sorry, but I had to. I needed it.

01:33:49.023 --> 01:33:52.075
I left it at the
Dixie Hotel, room 27.

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:55.445
- Where are you?
- Penn Station.

01:33:55.446 --> 01:33:58.240
- Is he with you?
- Yes.

01:33:58.241 --> 01:34:01.576
He's going to Washington,
isn't he? To the house?

01:34:01.577 --> 01:34:04.788
- Yes.
- Regan, don't go with him.

01:34:04.789 --> 01:34:08.833
I have to. It's my fault.
He's doing it for me.

01:34:08.834 --> 01:34:12.971
Regan, listen to me.
You're in terrible danger.

01:34:14.549 --> 01:34:17.725
Gene, I gotta go. I'm sorry. Bye.

01:34:23.724 --> 01:34:25.900
Where is she?

01:34:26.269 --> 01:34:28.152
Penn Station.

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:38.329
Hey, stop that!

01:34:42.994 --> 01:34:45.712
Stupid bitch!

01:34:45.997 --> 01:34:48.540
- Where are you going?
- Washington.

01:34:48.541 --> 01:34:53.636
- I'm going with you.
- Call my kids. I'll be in touch.

01:35:12.106 --> 01:35:16.326
Father. Father.

01:35:17.612 --> 01:35:20.280
Father, tickets!

01:35:20.281 --> 01:35:22.832
Do you have any money?

01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:37.839
No, I'm with him! He's sick.

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:41.259
They... They gave him an injection.

01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:44.938
Leave her alone. She belongs to me!

01:35:55.107 --> 01:35:57.025
It's an accident.

01:35:57.026 --> 01:35:59.118
Doctor!

01:36:00.196 --> 01:36:03.289
I need a doctor!

01:36:04.283 --> 01:36:08.503
Drive on. Someone must
have called an ambulance.

01:36:21.217 --> 01:36:24.352
Well, Regan can wait, I guess.

01:36:26.597 --> 01:36:30.191
Wait! I'm a doctor. I'll help you.

01:36:30.351 --> 01:36:32.435
Let me see.

01:36:32.436 --> 01:36:34.570
Hold still.

01:36:42.905 --> 01:36:44.864
The power.

01:36:44.865 --> 01:36:49.585
It's getting nearer.
Can't you feel it?

01:36:50.329 --> 01:36:54.590
The power is immense. It fills me.

01:36:54.792 --> 01:36:57.510
I can do anything.

01:36:58.129 --> 01:37:00.013
Gene....

01:37:00.297 --> 01:37:02.932
You called Gene, didn't you?

01:37:28.325 --> 01:37:31.210
Father?

01:37:31.495 --> 01:37:35.256
Father, please don't be lost to me.

01:37:49.597 --> 01:37:53.399
- Why don't you loosen your tie?
- Thank you.

01:37:59.982 --> 01:38:03.201
Why are you looking at me like that?

01:38:05.362 --> 01:38:07.789
The power.

01:38:08.407 --> 01:38:10.917
I must take you there.

01:38:11.327 --> 01:38:14.670
Did Kokumo tell you that?

01:38:15.623 --> 01:38:17.632
He said...

01:38:18.292 --> 01:38:20.927
the Good Locust....

01:38:24.381 --> 01:38:27.759
- We'll get a taxi. Quick, hurry!
- Yes.

01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:29.969
Taxi! Taxi!

01:38:29.970 --> 01:38:32.388
- There's one!
- Hey, lady!

01:38:32.389 --> 01:38:34.808
Lady, that's my taxi!

01:38:34.809 --> 01:38:36.567
Animals!

01:38:36.811 --> 01:38:38.986
- Sorry about that.
- People!

01:38:54.245 --> 01:38:56.162
Where to?

01:38:56.163 --> 01:38:58.422
Give him the address.

01:38:58.749 --> 01:39:02.218
Georgetown. 8 Prospect Street.

01:39:02.336 --> 01:39:06.806
- 8 Prospect Street?
- Yes! Come on, let's go!

01:39:19.228 --> 01:39:22.446
Get going! The girl has to get home!

01:39:30.531 --> 01:39:32.874
What now?

01:39:32.992 --> 01:39:36.002
I'm gonna see about this!

01:39:38.122 --> 01:39:41.374
- It won't do no good.
- She's a doctor.

01:39:41.375 --> 01:39:46.095
- This is Washington.
- Someone's dying.

01:39:50.759 --> 01:39:53.102
Father, no!

01:40:20.706 --> 01:40:23.424
Father? Father?

01:40:28.005 --> 01:40:30.006
Father, wait!

01:40:30.007 --> 01:40:32.934
Driver, please hurry!

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:51.118
Come on!

01:40:56.992 --> 01:40:59.835
This is Prospect Street now.

01:41:13.592 --> 01:41:15.893
There's the house.

01:41:30.401 --> 01:41:32.535
I can't control it!

01:41:35.614 --> 01:41:37.999
It's going crazy!

01:41:45.624 --> 01:41:47.591
Oh, my God!

01:42:26.165 --> 01:42:31.302
Father.

01:42:31.587 --> 01:42:34.722
Let me reach you.

01:42:55.903 --> 01:42:57.779
Sharon?

01:42:57.780 --> 01:43:00.740
Get me out of here!

01:43:00.741 --> 01:43:03.409
Help me!

01:43:03.410 --> 01:43:04.952
Sharon!

01:43:04.953 --> 01:43:07.663
We've got to help Regan!

01:43:07.664 --> 01:43:10.758
Sharon!

01:43:14.254 --> 01:43:17.014
Sharon?

01:43:24.098 --> 01:43:27.183
At least help Regan!

01:43:27.184 --> 01:43:31.020
- To do what?
- To fight this thing!

01:43:31.021 --> 01:43:32.863
Name it.

01:43:34.525 --> 01:43:36.867
Pazuzu.

01:43:37.277 --> 01:43:39.203
Sharon.

01:44:20.237 --> 01:44:22.697
I've got to get inside.

01:44:22.698 --> 01:44:25.249
Let me inside!

01:44:27.202 --> 01:44:29.753
Sharon.

01:44:36.628 --> 01:44:38.804
Regan....

01:44:42.301 --> 01:44:46.220
No! Father Lamont, help me!

01:44:46.221 --> 01:44:49.849
Kokumo! Remember Father Merrin?

01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:51.609
No!

01:44:52.561 --> 01:44:56.314
He's mine. He's chosen me.

01:44:56.315 --> 01:45:01.327
Pazuzu's Regan is the only Regan!

01:45:06.491 --> 01:45:09.210
Be joined with us, Father.

01:45:09.328 --> 01:45:11.128
No.

01:45:17.553 --> 01:45:21.138
No. Please.

01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:23.766
Kill her.

01:45:29.223 --> 01:45:31.774
No!

01:45:42.069 --> 01:45:47.831
No. No. No.

01:45:49.618 --> 01:45:52.336
Sharon!

01:45:53.413 --> 01:45:56.415
The wings. The wings are brushing me!

01:45:56.416 --> 01:46:00.302
The wings are brushing me!
I must! I must!

01:46:00.754 --> 01:46:03.756
We like to call her the Good Locust.

01:46:03.757 --> 01:46:07.935
She was evolved to resist
the brushing of the wings.

01:46:08.595 --> 01:46:13.440
No! Once the wings have brushed
you, you're mine forever!

01:46:13.934 --> 01:46:16.852
She will break the chain reaction.

01:46:16.853 --> 01:46:19.446
Kill her! We command you!

01:46:26.613 --> 01:46:29.748
Why me? Why me?

01:46:48.677 --> 01:46:52.855
You must tear out her evil heart.

01:47:06.695 --> 01:47:09.322
Regan!

01:47:09.323 --> 01:47:12.124
Pazuzu!

01:47:24.171 --> 01:47:27.014
Sharon!

01:47:28.675 --> 01:47:31.435
Sharon!

01:47:36.266 --> 01:47:38.275
Help!

01:47:39.102 --> 01:47:42.521
Help! Help, somebody!

01:47:42.522 --> 01:47:46.909
Help me, somebody! Help me!

01:48:22.396 --> 01:48:26.107
Regan!

01:49:45.312 --> 01:49:49.156
Regan!

01:52:30.018 --> 01:52:32.353
I...

01:52:32.354 --> 01:52:34.905
chose...

01:52:35.732 --> 01:52:38.033
evil.

01:52:39.069 --> 01:52:40.569
No.

01:52:40.570 --> 01:52:44.790
Sharon, your hunger for
belief was your truth.

01:52:56.628 --> 01:52:59.763
Sharon.

01:53:01.049 --> 01:53:04.017
Regan.

01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:24.329
The time has come.

01:53:24.614 --> 01:53:27.708
Now we are saved and made strong.

01:53:27.742 --> 01:53:30.585
The enemy of the human race...

01:53:32.622 --> 01:53:34.756
is subdued.

01:53:52.392 --> 01:53:55.569
Regan. I'm sorry.

01:53:58.022 --> 01:54:00.615
I understand now.

01:54:00.942 --> 01:54:03.326
The world won't.

01:54:03.695 --> 01:54:05.245
Not yet.

01:54:14.372 --> 01:54:17.090
You have to go.

01:54:17.292 --> 01:54:19.801
Take care of her.

01:54:45.737 --> 01:54:49.364
- What happened?
- Oh, my God! How awful!

01:54:49.365 --> 01:54:52.542
In God's name, what happened?

01:54:52.744 --> 01:54:56.205
- Was anybody in the building?
- Gangway, please.

01:54:56.206 --> 01:54:59.416
You witnessed what went on here?

01:54:59.417 --> 01:55:02.135
Was anyone inside?

01:55:03.922 --> 01:55:06.515
Lady, are you okay?
