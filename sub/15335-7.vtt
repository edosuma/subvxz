REPEAT THE LESSON
BACK TO ME.

37:31.950 --> 37:34.453
BEST WAY TO GET
YOURSELF OUT OF A JAM--

37:34.486 --> 37:38.457
CONFESS TO SOMETHING
ILLEGAL, IMMORAL,
OR EMBARRASSING.

37:38.990 --> 37:41.593
YOU'RE A QUICK STUDY.

37:44.830 --> 37:45.564
CONFESS?

37:45.597 --> 37:46.532
YOU NEED TO CONFESS.

37:46.565 --> 37:49.301
CONFESS TO SOMETHING
I HAVE NO MEMORY OF DOING?

37:49.335 --> 37:50.802
WHO DID IT,
IF NOT YOU?

37:50.836 --> 37:53.505
HOW COULD I HAVE DRIVEN
SOMEONE OFF THE ROAD

37:53.539 --> 37:56.007
AND KEPT ON DRIVING
FOR 2 MORE MILES

37:56.041 --> 37:58.310
WHILE STILL SLEEPING?
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

37:58.344 --> 37:59.978
THE POLICE
HAVE A WITNESS.

38:00.011 --> 38:02.414
TO A CAR. TO A CAR
SIMILAR TO MINE.

38:02.448 --> 38:05.250
AND THEY WENT OVER MY CAR.
MY CAR WASN'T DAMAGED.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.753
THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE MY CAR
WAS IN AN ACCIDENT.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.956
THE ACCUSATION
WAS THAT THIS WOMAN
WAS CUT OFF,

38:10.989 --> 38:12.023
NOT RUN INTO.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.091
YES, BUT LISTEN.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.761
THEY HAVE NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
IMPLICATING ME OR YOU,

38:15.794 --> 38:19.264
WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE
PRESSING YOU FOR A CONFESSION,

38:19.297 --> 38:21.032
BECAUSE THEY HAVE
NOTHING ELSE.

38:21.066 --> 38:22.133
THEN TELL THEM
THE TRUTH.

38:22.167 --> 38:23.402
TELL THEM YOU WERE
DRIVING THE CAR.

38:23.435 --> 38:26.204
I'D BE CONFESSING
WE BOTH COMMITTED PERJURY,
WHICH IS A FELONY,

38:26.237 --> 38:28.607
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
TO MY HUSBAND AND HIS COMMAND,

38:28.640 --> 38:32.978
AND WHAT HAPPENS
TO YOUR HUSBAND AND HIS TEAM
AND TO THE UNIT?

38:33.011 --> 38:34.513
[SIGHS]

38:34.546 --> 38:36.147
THIS WOMAN MAY DIE,

38:36.181 --> 38:38.350
AND THE POLICE THINK
I'M RESPONSIBLE.

38:38.384 --> 38:42.454
IT'S NOT WHAT THEY THINK.
IT'S WHAT THEY CAN PROVE.

38:42.488 --> 38:43.221
I DON'T KNOW.

38:43.254 --> 38:45.023
BUT I KNOW.
I UNFORTUNATELY KNOW,

38:45.056 --> 38:47.959
AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU
THE LAW IS A LYING CONTEST.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.829
AND IF YOU ARE CAUGHT
IN THE LAW, THEN GOD HELP YOU,

38:50.862 --> 38:53.331
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT THE TRUTH IS.

38:53.365 --> 38:56.368
ALL THAT MATTERS IS
CAN YOUR POSITION PREVAIL.

38:56.402 --> 38:58.036
BECAUSE IF THE POLICE
WANT A CONVICTION,

38:58.069 --> 38:59.905
YOU THINK
THEY'RE NOT GONNA LIE?

38:59.938 --> 39:04.042
I TELL YOU I DID NOT
RUN THIS WOMAN OFF THE ROAD.

39:04.075 --> 39:05.444
YOU MUST BELIEVE ME.

39:05.477 --> 39:09.080
WHY? BECAUSE IF
IT'S NOT TRUE, THEN YOU ARE
AN ACCESSORY TO THE CRIME.

39:09.114 --> 39:14.085
I'M SORRY. I AM SO SORRY
TO HAVE ENMESHED YOU IN THIS.

39:14.119 --> 39:14.953
I AM SO SORRY.

39:14.986 --> 39:18.757
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
WE CANNOT STOP NOW.

39:22.093 --> 39:23.995
OH, LOOK AT THAT BEAD.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.164
NOW IS THAT
GREAT STUFF OR WHAT?

39:26.197 --> 39:30.168
HECTOR, I THINK
THIS MIGHT BE
YOUR FINEST RUN YET.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.504
I APPRECIATE YOUR ENDORSEMENT.

39:32.538 --> 39:33.539
MM-HMM.

39:33.572 --> 39:34.806
MMM.

39:34.840 --> 39:38.109
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU CALLED THE OLD MAN
TO COME AND GET YOU OUT.

39:38.143 --> 39:39.210
[BOTH LAUGH]

39:39.244 --> 39:40.879
HE'S A GOOD COMMANDER
AND ALL,

39:40.912 --> 39:41.980
BUT HE IS A GUT EATER.

39:42.013 --> 39:45.383
TREAT YOUR OPPONENTS
AS IF THEY WERE
YOUR EMPLOYEES.

39:45.417 --> 39:46.952
BREAK IT DOWN.

39:46.985 --> 39:51.056
RYAN DOESN'T WANNA KNOW
WHAT HE DOESN'T
WANNA KNOW.

39:51.089 --> 39:52.057
NOW HE'S INVOLVED.

39:52.090 --> 39:55.060
HOW? WE HAVE
INVOLVED HIM.

39:55.427 --> 39:58.063
HE IS A CO-CONSPIRATOR.

39:58.096 --> 39:59.030
IN WHAT, BOSS?

39:59.064 --> 40:01.467
IN WHATEVER
HE HELPED US OUT OF.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.401
AIN'T LIFE HARSH?

40:03.435 --> 40:05.103
[CHUCKLES]

40:05.604 --> 40:08.406
[BOB LAUGHING]

40:08.440 --> 40:12.544
RYAN ASKED
WHAT YOUR WIFE WOULD SAY
IF SHE KNEW.

40:12.578 --> 40:13.945
AND TOP SAID, "WELL,
SIR, I'D TELL HER,

40:13.979 --> 40:16.815
"WOMAN, NOW THAT'S
GETTING INTO
MY PERSONAL LIFE.

40:16.848 --> 40:20.752
"AND YOU KNOW
HOW I LIKE TO KEEP
MY PERSONAL LIFE

40:20.786 --> 40:22.821
SEPARATE FROM
MY MARRIED LIFE."

40:22.854 --> 40:25.924
[BOTH LAUGH]

40:29.094 --> 40:32.130
SHE'S HIS DAUGHTER,
ISN'T SHE?

40:32.998 --> 40:37.002
DOLORES,
SHE'S RON'S DAUGHTER?

40:37.035 --> 40:39.070
AND WHY WOULD
YOU SAY THAT?

40:39.104 --> 40:41.740
WELL, RON WAS
ON A LOT OF MISSIONS

40:41.773 --> 40:45.443
TO EL SALVADOR
IN THE EIGHTIES.

40:45.477 --> 40:49.114
SHE IS HIS DAUGHTER,
ISN'T SHE?

40:49.481 --> 40:57.055
SON, I NEVER INQUIRE
AS TO WHAT A MAN DOES
ON HIS OFF-DUTY TIME.

40:57.556 --> 40:59.157
PERSONAL LIFE.

41:00.358 --> 41:01.693
YEAH.

41:01.727 --> 41:02.928
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

41:02.961 --> 41:06.698
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
20TH CENTURY FOX AND CBS

41:06.732 --> 41:08.667
[LAUGHS]

41:08.700 --> 41:09.935
GIVE ME SOME
OF THAT. YEAH.
