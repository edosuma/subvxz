it's hard to think about it

Was there a cat in here?

00:52.385 --> 00:55.096
That was my singing.
That's my talent.

Most people close their eyes

01:02.729 --> 01:04.605
- It's not true.
- It is, Michael.

01:04.897 --> 01:07.525
It's very impossible not to.

01:09.527 --> 01:11.571
Well, I can. This should be my talent.

01:17.619 --> 01:18.870
I'm not a lip-reader.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.498
It'll be fine, honey.

Maybe it'll be better
if you don't win this one.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.004
just a cruise with your grandmother.

Okay, I heard that.
With Lindsay out of the competition

01:36.471 --> 01:37.639
and Buster gone missing,

01:38.014 --> 01:39.724
you're my only real competition, Michael.

01:39.933 --> 01:43.311
- What do you mean, "gone missing"?
- I... I told you.

01:44.646 --> 01:47.941
My plan. I took Buster off his leash,
and I brought him down to the beach.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.234
Don't worry, I told him how to swim.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.402
Hmm, my only thing is,
I have to figure out how

Honestly, these are so easy.

02:56.801 --> 02:59.554
That's it. I'm done. Ow.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.895
Abra...

03:08.521 --> 03:09.606
cadaver.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.985
What do you think? Can we chisel off
the hat of this thing

03:14.068 --> 03:15.737

03:15.820 --> 03:18.198
Oh. Well, the competition's not over.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.825
We haven't even seen Lindsay.

03:20.909 --> 03:24.537
And you never will.
I want to save you the trouble

03:24.621 --> 03:27.832
of having to close your eyes

03:28.082 --> 03:29.417
So how's this for my talent?

03:37.967 --> 03:38.927

03:39.010 --> 03:41.054
how Tap-Dancing Ghost doesn't take
the whole thing.

03:41.137 --> 03:43.014
Should we just throw a handkerchief
over this?

03:43.097 --> 03:45.642
Michael will do something impressive.
Don't worry.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.232
Buster went in the water.
He tried to swim. He almost drowned.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.399
Oh, my God! Do something!

03:53.483 --> 03:55.360
Save him!

03:55.443 --> 03:57.612
No, no, no, this isn't...
this isn't Michael's talent.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.113
This doesn't... This doesn't count!

03:59.197 --> 04:00.865
Who took off his gentleman collar?

04:04.118 --> 04:05.995
Oh, spirit of this dead bird,

04:06.412 --> 04:08.539
fly into my dead brother!

04:10.541 --> 04:12.961
Oh!

04:13.211 --> 04:14.587
Oh!

04:14.671 --> 04:17.089
I'm not too bad at this thing.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.841
Well, we all know
who the hero is today.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.387
We have our new Mr. and Mrs. Bluth.

04:22.679 --> 04:26.266
Michael and Buster.
You're okay, honey.

04:26.349 --> 04:29.602
Mommy's here.
And as much juice as you want tonight.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.897
Tonight, you get juice.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.156
<i>It was the day of Buster's trial.</i>

04:42.240 --> 04:43.950
<i>And while the Bluth family was</i>

04:44.033 --> 04:45.785
<i>- feeling tense...</i>
- You okay?

04:45.868 --> 04:47.287
- Uh-uh.
<i>- ...they were hoping the same</i>

04:47.370 --> 04:50.498
<i>- was not true for their attorney.</i>
- Where is Dusty?

04:51.541 --> 04:53.459
Oh, he wants to make an entrance.

04:53.543 --> 04:57.046
I... I think he's gonna come in...
nice and relaxed.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.882
And thank you again
for being a team player on that one.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.593
Believe me, the guilt will fade.

05:03.177 --> 05:05.263
I mean, I've cheated on you
a thousand times.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.974
I mean, almost makes up
for the permanent damage

05:08.057 --> 05:09.517
you did to my endocrine system.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.770
- Oh, God! God!
- Uh-oh.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.189
- Easy.
- Oh, man.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.442
What a day!

05:17.525 --> 05:19.527
Sorry. Just... I heard my...

05:20.278 --> 05:21.779
my dad's in the hospital. Just...

05:21.863 --> 05:24.741
- No, don't worry about that.
- I didn't need this today.

05:24.824 --> 05:25.742
Don't worry about that.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.869
You need to focus
on your opening statement.

05:27.952 --> 05:29.329
I go first? You said I was second.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.663
I'm not ready!

05:30.747 --> 05:32.290
You <i>are </i> second.

05:32.373 --> 05:36.377
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Spencer Stanley presiding.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.258
- Please be seated.
- I cannot wait

05:42.342 --> 05:44.344
to see her reaction when she sees him.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.560
You cut your hair.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.812
Eh. Yeah.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.607
Does she look rattled to you?

05:58.941 --> 06:00.485
<i> And soon, Michael arrived,</i>

06:00.568 --> 06:03.112
<i>just in time for the opening argument.</i>

06:03.196 --> 06:07.450
...the defense will probably
have you review a video, the one here,

06:09.077 --> 06:11.496
where they'll claim
that he had merely approached

06:11.579 --> 06:13.331
and discovered a body on the stairs,

06:13.414 --> 06:16.417
and then claim
it miraculously disappeared.

06:16.876 --> 06:17.794
It did.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.129
And so, it would seem that it did.

06:20.838 --> 06:25.051
Unless a closer look was made
of the time code.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.638
We'll learn that the gap

06:28.721 --> 06:32.725
was the result of Buster trying
to destroy the evidence.

06:33.559 --> 06:36.646
And we'll also review footage
of the same stair car

06:36.729 --> 06:38.064
on a bluff over the ocean

06:38.147 --> 06:41.192
and a man who appears to be Mr. Bluth

06:41.776 --> 06:46.531
tossing what appears
to be Ms. Austero into the surf.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.493
Let's remember why we're all here.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.537
To honor the life

06:52.620 --> 06:54.247
of the most charitable,

06:54.330 --> 06:58.042
vibrant, balanced,
beautiful woman named Lucille

06:58.126 --> 06:59.752
this town has ever known.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.754
Burn.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.132
It's just that my mother's name
is Lucille as well,

07:04.215 --> 07:07.301
- so the... the burn was on her.
<i>- </i> I'll allow the burn.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.971
Mr. Radler,
you may begin your opening argument

07:10.054 --> 07:11.806
- for the defense.
- I... I know.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.978
- Oh!
<i>- Things were off to a bad start.</i>

07:17.061 --> 07:18.896
<i>- But on the plus side...</i>
- If you find that funny,

07:18.980 --> 07:21.399
wait till you hear
the defense's opening argument.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.526
<i>...Dusty got the laugh he'd hoped for</i>

07:23.609 --> 07:25.736
<i>at the start of his defense.</i>

07:26.320 --> 07:29.157
Uh, I... I didn't know
about the videotape.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.491
So, I mean, what...

07:30.575 --> 07:34.287
- If you'll... ...please...
- I... I'm...

07:34.370 --> 07:36.998
Hmm. Yeah.

07:37.331 --> 07:39.917
You can just see
he... he's throwing the body

07:40.001 --> 07:42.128
right off the cliff,
so everyone's like, "Uh..."

07:42.211 --> 07:45.465
"I mean, what else could it be?"

07:46.591 --> 07:49.260
I didn't even know
you could use videotape. Um...

07:49.343 --> 07:51.137
<i>But to the Bluths' surprise,</i>

07:51.220 --> 07:53.973
<i>the DA didn't immediately call
for a mistrial.</i>

07:54.348 --> 07:55.892
I'm feeling
like people are judging me,

07:55.975 --> 07:59.020
and it's just not making me feel
that great.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.064
I... I feel like I got, like, totally

08:02.148 --> 08:03.816
the hard part of this case.

08:04.108 --> 08:07.153
- What the hell is going on?
<i>- Although she did show</i>

08:07.236 --> 08:09.447
<i>uncommon empathy
to the opposing counsel.</i>

08:09.530 --> 08:11.491
You can do it. You're ready.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.494
Everything go okay last night?

08:15.203 --> 08:17.288
I think I made a terrible mistake.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.998
<i>In fact, she had,</i>

08:19.081 --> 08:21.042
<i>as, the night before, while believing</i>

08:21.125 --> 08:24.045
<i>she was paying a carnal visit to Dusty...</i>

08:24.128 --> 08:25.838
Oh, it's so dark in here.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.593
Hello?

08:31.093 --> 08:33.971
I can hear you breathing.

08:34.138 --> 08:37.058
Oh,
so you <i>did </i> know I was coming.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.977
Good for you, getting a head start.

08:42.145 --> 08:44.190
And speaking of that...

08:44.273 --> 08:47.151
<i>But, had the lights been on,</i>
<i>Lucille would have discovered</i>

08:47.235 --> 08:49.904
<i>that the tubes and other accoutrements
weren't there</i>

08:49.987 --> 08:51.864
<i>for Dusty's erotic entertainment...</i>

08:52.448 --> 08:54.367
<i>...but were instead the implements</i>

08:54.450 --> 08:57.161
<i>That kept Dusty's
centenarian father alive.</i>

08:57.245 --> 09:00.331
So, Lottie is his ex?

09:00.414 --> 09:03.167
- Stepmom.
- I really appreciate this, Lottie.

09:03.251 --> 09:06.420
Please. I've known you since you were 30!

09:07.046 --> 09:08.673
And you can call me "Mom."

09:09.840 --> 09:10.716
Mom.

09:11.175 --> 09:13.261
If... If the judge will allow it,

09:13.469 --> 09:15.805
permission to hug the defense counsel.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.936
Hell yeah. Let's get the hug on.

09:22.019 --> 09:23.896
Yeah! Yeah!

09:23.980 --> 09:25.606
Aw.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.025
Oh! My baby!

09:28.109 --> 09:31.487
<i>It would've been a great ending</i>
<i>for a feel-good movie,</i>

09:31.571 --> 09:34.448
<i>but it was a horrible beginning
for a gruesome murder trial.</i>

09:34.532 --> 09:36.617
What a baby!

09:36.701 --> 09:38.494
Shut up, murderer!

09:38.578 --> 09:40.246
Well, he is. Clearly is.

09:40.329 --> 09:41.956
<i>And during a break in both the trial</i>

09:42.290 --> 09:46.627
<i>and the hug of the opposing attorneys,
Lucille caught up with Dusty.</i>

09:47.044 --> 09:48.879
I was a little nervous.

09:49.088 --> 09:52.842
For my first murder trial, though,
my first anything trial, not bad, right?

09:53.301 --> 09:54.802
That was humiliating.

09:54.885 --> 09:57.221
I thought Lottie was your <i>ex-wife.</i>

09:57.597 --> 10:00.516
Nah. I mean, she's a little old for me,
don't you think?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.435
She's, like... ...your age.

10:03.519 --> 10:07.023
Look, I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't clear
about our relationship.

10:07.815 --> 10:10.109
Uh, are you super mad at me?

10:10.192 --> 10:12.695
Oh, for God's sakes,
stop talking like a child.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.071
I mean, how old are you?

10:14.363 --> 10:16.657
- Fifty-six and a half.
- Jesus!

10:16.741 --> 10:18.075
Pull yourself together.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.285
Absolutely.

10:19.368 --> 10:21.162
Not gonna let that ruin my recess.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.792
There you are. Okay.
Now, Mom, what in the hell was that?

10:26.876 --> 10:28.461
I thought this was Dustin Radler,

10:28.878 --> 10:30.296
the fierce trial attorney,

10:30.379 --> 10:32.548
the only one who's ever beaten Lottie.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.551
Well, as it turns out,
the Dustin Radler I've been with...

10:35.635 --> 10:36.636
is his son.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.305
Oh, my God, he's a motherboy.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.515
There were...
There were no hints before today?

10:41.599 --> 10:44.268
Just that I only ever seem
to create or attract them.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.730
You got us into this mess.
What are you gonna do?

10:48.147 --> 10:50.524
All right. I made an awful choice,

10:50.608 --> 10:53.944
but did I give you a hard time
when you gave all our life rights

10:54.028 --> 10:56.656
to Imagine Films to make some TV show?

10:56.739 --> 10:59.992
- That was somewhat amiss of you.
- Yes, you did.

11:00.076 --> 11:03.871
As it turns out, nothing came
of that project, which I predicted.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.831
Just like I predicted your bet

11:05.915 --> 11:09.335
on the DA calling a mistrial
wasn't exactly beating the odds.

11:09.418 --> 11:11.337
- She offered him gum.
- Okay, I hired

11:11.420 --> 11:14.924
a completely incompetent lawyer
and put my son's life in the hands

11:15.007 --> 11:17.843
of a moron, and I know
what you want me to say, Michael.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.638
Okay, I'll say it... My bad!

11:22.973 --> 11:27.061
Wow. I don't think
that I have heard you apologize since, um,

11:27.520 --> 11:29.939
uh, since people used to use
that phrase to apologize.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.982
Okay, well,
I think we may have to beg the judge

11:32.066 --> 11:33.651
- to declare a mistrial.
- No.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.654
We have to do this now
while they still don't have a body.

11:37.321 --> 11:40.366
It's our best chance for acquittal.
We'll work with what we have.

11:40.449 --> 11:43.536
Maybe her maternal instincts will kick in,

11:43.619 --> 11:46.038
and we'll benefit
from her being his stepmother.

11:46.122 --> 11:49.041
Yeah, I don't know about that.
He's not a child, after all.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.295
It occurs to me that he may not come back
from recess

11:53.379 --> 11:54.880
unless he hears a bell. I'll get him.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.596
<i>As the trial was continuing,</i>

12:02.680 --> 12:05.391
<i>Dusty was desperate</i>
<i>for </i> any <i>kind of witness.</i>

12:05.474 --> 12:07.643
- <i>...Guys and Dolls...</i>
<i>- Even one that came</i>

12:07.727 --> 12:09.603
<i>- with a headshot.</i>
- I was more than interested

12:09.687 --> 12:11.856
to try out to be one
of the character witnesses

12:11.939 --> 12:13.524
in Buster's trial.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.153
- Thank you for offering.
- That's very nice.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.905
Oh, please. I know the Buster character
better than anyone.

12:20.197 --> 12:22.700
I could play Buster with one arm
tied behind my back.

12:22.783 --> 12:26.454
In fact, I've played Buster
with <i>two </i> arms tied behind my back.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.038
I was handcuffed.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.125
Well, this is...
They're buying it!

12:31.208 --> 12:34.503
- Now, that's a witness.
- Um, we don't need you to play Buster

12:34.587 --> 12:37.381
on the stand,
more just talk about him as a person.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.217
Oh. Well,

12:40.426 --> 12:43.137
you don't think
I'd be more appealing as the accused?

12:43.220 --> 12:46.140
I mean,
the Buster <i>I </i> played could never kill.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.141
Yeah, it's...

12:47.224 --> 12:49.602
it's really not an acting job, man.
I can't...

12:49.685 --> 12:51.854
Yes, yes, just... don't push.
I get it.

12:51.937 --> 12:55.149
Just tell the story the way
you told it to me earlier today.

12:55.232 --> 12:57.777
Beginning with what you were doing
the night of the murder.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.653
<i>Alleged </i> murder. Alleged.

12:59.945 --> 13:00.863
Yes, yes.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.534
It was Cinco... de Cuatro!

13:05.618 --> 13:08.120
No, no, no,
I'm... I'm gonna stop you there.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.580
- I still feel you're acting.
- Really?

13:09.914 --> 13:10.956
- A little. I do.
- Huh.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.918
So, just no script at all?
Just vérité? Okay.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.836
Well, uh, here it is with nothing.

13:16.712 --> 13:19.298
I needed somebody to play a part in my...

13:19.548 --> 13:24.136
<i>Fantastic...</i> for legal purposes,
I can't say the rest of it... musical,

13:24.220 --> 13:26.555
and Buster happily filled in.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.517
<i>Well, "happily"</i>
<i>might have been an overstatement.</i>

13:29.600 --> 13:31.227
I've got a show to do in ten minutes,

13:31.310 --> 13:33.854
and I haven't got a Thing to wear...
this Thing suit.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.731
I gotta find Lucille 2.
I gotta give her pictures.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.149
I don't know the songs.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.151
You're a monster.
You don't have to be any good.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.403
What?

13:41.487 --> 13:45.199
So, you're saying <i>Buster </i> was performing
as the rock monster

13:45.282 --> 13:48.369
when the murder allegedly took place?
Is that true, Buster?

13:48.452 --> 13:51.539
That's what I told you.
He asked me to that night.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.290
And you'll confirm that on the stand?

13:54.166 --> 13:55.042
I will.

13:55.584 --> 13:59.004
And perhaps I'll do it
in an English accent!

13:59.672 --> 14:02.508
Nay, nay, I shan't.
I shall stick to the script.

14:02.716 --> 14:06.053
Not script. Nope. Vérité.
I have taken the note... vérité.

14:06.136 --> 14:07.179
- Yes, yes.
- Great.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.056
Now, I do wish I could do this gratis,

14:09.139 --> 14:11.684
but I'm having a bit
of a shelter crisis of late.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.519
- I hate to play hardball...
- I don't think

14:13.602 --> 14:15.312
that they pay witnesses.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.815
Hmm...

14:18.315 --> 14:19.275
Uh, unrelated...

14:19.358 --> 14:21.861
What happens to this room when you leave?

14:21.944 --> 14:23.863
Yeah, I think they lock it up at night.

14:24.321 --> 14:26.490
Damn it. Damn it, damn it, damn it.

14:30.870 --> 14:31.745
Damn it!

14:32.788 --> 14:33.747
I just...

14:34.915 --> 14:37.001
...need somewhere to s...

14:37.751 --> 14:41.463
All right, well, gentlemen,
thank you so much for your time.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.300
And I will be seeing you.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.385
<i>But back at the model home,</i>

14:46.468 --> 14:49.889
<i>an unemployed Michael was doing
his own courtroom preparation,</i>

14:49.972 --> 14:51.015
<i>when he had a visit...</i>

14:51.098 --> 14:53.642
- Hey, Dad.
<i>- ...from the son who had unemployed him.</i>

14:53.726 --> 14:54.852
Hello, son.

14:55.352 --> 14:57.479
- Figured you'd be up here.
- Yeah.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.649
Well, that's...
father-son psychic connection.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.444
The drop stairs were down,
and you were yelling, "Where is it?"

15:03.527 --> 15:04.486
Oh, that helps, too.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.864
- Sure.
- Trying to find old law books.

15:07.072 --> 15:10.159
Lottie Dottie Da did say
that Dusty would give the guilty guys

15:10.242 --> 15:11.535
a run for their money.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.913
I think she was being sarcastic,
but I am free now,

15:13.996 --> 15:16.957
so I'm gonna try to help out in court,
which is why I'm trying to find...

15:17.625 --> 15:19.585
A copy of <i>A Few Good Men?</i>

15:19.668 --> 15:21.086
Look at that. How'd that get there?

15:21.170 --> 15:24.381
Actually, I thought
I'd find my maritime law diploma.

15:24.465 --> 15:27.676
You know, as proof that I passed
what they call the "wet bar."

15:28.052 --> 15:29.929
You know,
you may not have to get involved.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.598
I mean, is this something
maritime law even applies to here?

15:32.932 --> 15:35.142
It should. He dumped her in the ocean.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.519
- True.
- Allegedly.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.521
- Obviously allegedly.
- I'm worried this is

15:39.605 --> 15:41.231
part of that thing that you always do.

15:41.315 --> 15:44.026
You try to fix things, and you end up
putting yourself in the middle of them.

15:44.485 --> 15:47.613
- You have to be the hero.
- Oh, well. I do not get in the middle.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.950
You dated my girlfriend.
You moved into my dorm room.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.993
You make it sound
like I'm always in your business.

15:53.077 --> 15:54.578
- You bought my business.
- Well...

15:54.662 --> 15:56.121
Which has been a huge headache.

15:56.205 --> 15:59.166
Now I have to deliver this border wall
to the Chinese.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.209
These are great points.

16:00.834 --> 16:04.588
But what you don't know is
there's a reason I had to announce that.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.382
I know about the foot.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.676
It's why I had to fire you,
because by trying

16:08.759 --> 16:10.552
to fix things,
you just end up putting yourself

16:10.636 --> 16:12.346
in the middle of a much bigger risk.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.682
'Cause if you think the Chinese
are mad now,

16:14.765 --> 16:16.809
wait until they find out
that Fakeblock is not even...

16:19.812 --> 16:20.896
perfect yet.

16:21.271 --> 16:22.690
So I hear.

16:24.000 --> 16:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:32.700 --> 16:35.953
I cannot even get past the logo,
so you're close.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.580
But I get it.
You need time and money,

16:38.664 --> 16:40.958
and I know I was against this originally,

16:41.041 --> 16:44.003
but... maybe you can still sell it
to Rebel.

16:44.461 --> 16:45.629
No, I would never do that.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.006
Thank God.

16:47.673 --> 16:50.467
Because she's just using you
for the software.

16:50.676 --> 16:53.053
But I'm not getting in the middle.
I'm just agreeing with you.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.847
Don't even need to know your reasons.

16:55.639 --> 16:57.599
But why?
Just out of curiosity.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.601
Why can't you sell Fakeblock to Rebel?

16:59.685 --> 17:02.396
And just... just consider it a... a question
from an outsider.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.022
Because she dumped me.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.483
You're not just trying
to please me by saying this?

17:07.568 --> 17:09.944
And I wish I could give her the software

17:10.029 --> 17:10.988
to get her back, but...

17:14.156 --> 17:15.284
it's... it's fake.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.078
I knew it. I knew it.

17:18.829 --> 17:19.954
She's not over me?

17:20.497 --> 17:23.165
No, Fakeblock. It's fake.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.005
There is no privacy software.
I made the whole thing up.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.133
Made it up?
You told me a lie because you...

17:31.633 --> 17:34.636
I lied to you because you seemed
so proud of me, and then...

17:35.054 --> 17:37.264
my lying just got me
in deeper and deeper,

17:37.347 --> 17:38.724
and then you bought the company,

17:38.807 --> 17:40.851
and I had to fire you
so you wouldn't get in trouble,

17:40.934 --> 17:43.854
and now the whole family is in trouble,
and I have no idea how to solve it.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.731
I'm sorry, Dad.

17:45.814 --> 17:46.815
Are you mad?

17:47.149 --> 17:48.901
Uh, no.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.821
Uh-uh. I'm not... I'm not mad.
I, uh... I get it.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.031
You had your reasons.

17:54.615 --> 17:59.828
Um, I... I do wish that I had not removed
all of my privacy software

18:00.079 --> 18:02.915
and replaced it with Fakeblock,
but on the other hand,

18:02.998 --> 18:05.292
it does explain why Pemender
from Kuala Lumpur

18:05.375 --> 18:06.752
keeps signing into my Linkedln.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.466
The Chinese are gonna kill us.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.885
- I'll get us out of it.
- Please don't.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.180
<i>And back at the trial,</i>
<i>without Tobias,</i>

18:18.263 --> 18:20.974
<i>Dusty was without a witness
for the night of the murder.</i>

18:21.058 --> 18:22.518
<i>But Lottie had found one.</i>

18:22.601 --> 18:24.812
I call to the witness stand Gene Parmesan.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.146
Gene Parmesan.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.148
Gene Parmesan?

18:29.274 --> 18:30.692
Doesn't seem like he's here.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.653
That's impossible.
He's a private detective.

18:32.736 --> 18:33.570
He'd never be late.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.698
Well, has anyone checked under the...

18:38.325 --> 18:39.493
new bailiff?

18:40.077 --> 18:42.746
- Gene Parmesan.
- Gene!

18:42.830 --> 18:44.123
And I swear to tell the truth,

18:44.206 --> 18:47.167
- so help me God.
- That never gets old!

18:47.626 --> 18:49.962
I'll tell you something else
that never gets old. Whoops.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.463
I'm under oath.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.968
- On the night of Cinco de Cuatro...
- Yeah.

18:56.051 --> 18:58.428
...you were undercover,
working selling donkey punch.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.097
- Isn't that correct?
- Definitely undercover.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.182
I don't need two jobs.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.017
'Cause everything's going really good.

19:04.101 --> 19:05.644
What exactly is in a donkey punch?

19:05.727 --> 19:07.146
You know, mostly Kool-Aid.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.481
- So it's similar to juice, then?
- It is.

19:10.399 --> 19:11.817
<i>Lucille was concerned.</i>

19:11.900 --> 19:14.486
<i>The DA appeared to have done
her homework on Buster</i>

19:14.570 --> 19:18.949
<i>and his lack of restraint
under the influence of sugary juice.</i>

19:19.032 --> 19:21.326
<i>And she found herself resenting a man</i>

19:21.410 --> 19:23.036
<i>- she'd once admired.</i>
- Your witness.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.372
<i>But Lottie stopped short</i>
<i>of making that point.</i>

19:25.455 --> 19:26.999
Do you want me to take it easy on him?

19:27.082 --> 19:29.209
Or give it to him hard?
I know he's a friend of yours.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.378
He's not my friend anymore.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.505
Testifying against our family

19:33.589 --> 19:36.842
after all the times
I faked being surprised by him?

19:36.925 --> 19:39.219
<i>So Dusty went</i>
<i>after the witness's credibility.</i>

19:39.553 --> 19:43.307
Mr. Parmesan,
you say you're a master of disguises.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.476
How many looks
are you capable of creating?

19:48.312 --> 19:49.605
You asking me?

19:50.939 --> 19:52.149
I'm the judge.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.360
I'm Gene Parmesan.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.821
You say you had an undercover job,

19:57.905 --> 20:00.365
which means you must have left
the donkey punch stand.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.658
Isn't that correct?

20:02.034 --> 20:05.162
- Yes, it is.
<i>- </i> So you can't dispute my client's claim

20:05.412 --> 20:07.080
that he was dressed as the rock monster

20:07.164 --> 20:09.791
out on that floating barge
when the murder took place.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.836
Allegedly.
Allegedly took place.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.756
No, I did leave the donkey punch stand,

20:15.839 --> 20:18.425
uh, right before the play began.

20:18.508 --> 20:21.261
Mm-hmm. So how can you be sure

20:21.345 --> 20:23.847
that Buster <i>didn't </i> change
into the rock suit...

20:24.473 --> 20:25.891
as we've claimed?

20:26.934 --> 20:28.143
'Cause it was me.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.146
<i>After fighting with Lucille 2,</i>

20:31.230 --> 20:34.107
<i>Buster </i> did <i>end up</i>
<i>at the donkey punch stand...</i>

20:34.191 --> 20:35.651
It's punch, like the juice!

20:35.734 --> 20:37.486
Oh, I need some juice.

20:37.819 --> 20:39.446
<i>...but flew into a rage</i>

20:39.529 --> 20:41.281
<i>when he saw an old rival...</i>

20:41.365 --> 20:43.992
<i>...leaving behind</i>

20:44.076 --> 20:46.620
<i>the costume he was to be wearing, to a man</i>

20:46.703 --> 20:50.207
<i>who never said no to a costume
or a part-time job.</i>

20:50.290 --> 20:51.250
That's me.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.377
Yep.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.419
Wha...?

20:55.212 --> 20:57.256
<i>But while Gene</i>
<i>may have undermined</i>

20:57.339 --> 20:58.298
<i>- Buster's alibi...</i>
- Gene!

20:58.548 --> 21:01.385
<i>...back at the office,</i>
<i>George Michael was worried</i>

21:01.468 --> 21:03.470
<i>- about his dire situation...</i>
- Tickle, tickle.

21:03.553 --> 21:05.430
- Uncle Tobias, hi.
- Come on.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.975
<i>...when an even more dire one came</i>
<i>through the door.</i>

21:08.058 --> 21:09.768
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

21:09.851 --> 21:12.771
Well, our stay at the Spotted Palm

21:12.854 --> 21:16.275
came to a rather abrupt end
when "Bev" here...

21:16.358 --> 21:20.112
decided to look at her cellular telephone
without holding it at arm's length

21:20.195 --> 21:21.530
and putting on her readers first.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.324
- She blew our cover.
- Sorry, I keep forgetting

21:24.408 --> 21:26.118
that acting is my passion.

21:26.535 --> 21:27.911
It really ruined

21:27.995 --> 21:29.329
Annette's funeral,

21:29.413 --> 21:31.248
may she rest in peace.

21:31.707 --> 21:32.833
Maeby killed Annette?

21:33.458 --> 21:34.835
Where did we land with that?

21:34.918 --> 21:36.420
Uh... gore... she was gored.

21:36.503 --> 21:38.839
Yes. Gored in the running of the bulls.

21:38.922 --> 21:41.133
People were getting suspicious,
so it had to be somewhere

21:41.216 --> 21:42.551
where there wouldn't be a body.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.886
Or where an animal took off
with the body so fast...

21:44.970 --> 21:46.430
- That you couldn't get it back.
- Exactly.

21:46.513 --> 21:47.556
That was the idea.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.224
- Yep. Yes. Yep, yep.
- Yeah, yeah.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.935
Good. Well, if you guys were thinking
about staying here...

21:52.019 --> 21:54.521
Oh, thank you so much.
I told you he would come through!

21:54.604 --> 21:57.024
We cannot move in soon enough
for you.

21:57.107 --> 22:00.110
Some of our happiest days
as a family were spent here.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.862
It's not
an abandoned office anymore,

22:01.945 --> 22:03.905
so there are people doing work...
out there.

22:03.989 --> 22:08.452
Uh-huh. Well, if it's work you require,
I suppose we can act it off.

22:08.535 --> 22:10.829
- Yeah, that's going to be a problem.
- Well, surely,

22:10.912 --> 22:13.874
there must be some, uh,
in-house corporate training seminar

22:13.957 --> 22:16.835
we could do
or... or a sexual harassment video.

22:16.918 --> 22:19.755
I mean, I'm no Harvey Weinstein,
but I'm sure I could produce one.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.591
And I knew him. Did I tell you that story

22:22.674 --> 22:25.010
when Mr. Weinstein killed my ficus
in the '80s?

22:25.218 --> 22:26.720
When he came over to audition me for...

22:26.803 --> 22:30.265
Yes. We all know DeBrie Bardeaux snagged
a private audition

22:30.349 --> 22:31.767
with Harvey Weinstein.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.644
Yeah, but I came on too strong,
so I didn't get the part.

22:34.728 --> 22:38.523
Yes, well, some of us weren't lucky enough
to even have an audition to blow.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.942
Gosh, I don't really know
if we need any acting right now.

22:41.568 --> 22:44.404
The stuff we're doing here,
it's more about preventing hacking,

22:44.488 --> 22:47.824
- protecting privacy, and stuff like that.
- That's what I was trying to stop, too.

22:48.241 --> 22:50.994
Yes, Murphybrown here is a bit
of a computer whiz.

22:51.078 --> 22:51.995
Mm...

22:52.537 --> 22:53.997
He's worked on cable boxes.

22:54.081 --> 22:55.916
Yeah, I actually coded,
like...

22:55.999 --> 22:59.378
an extra layer beneath the firewall
to keep your data from being exposed.

22:59.669 --> 23:01.755
It's like a dam or, like, a... a stopper,

23:01.838 --> 23:04.299
or a barrier to stop people from...

23:04.383 --> 23:06.176
- Like a block?
- Okay.

23:06.259 --> 23:08.011
Can we do this in English, Professor?

23:08.095 --> 23:11.390
Oh, s-sorry, sorry, my...
Sorry, my fine student.

23:11.473 --> 23:12.849
I need a diagram.

23:12.933 --> 23:14.434
It makes no sense at all.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.937
But what he's basically saying is,

23:17.020 --> 23:19.731
nobody wants to be naked
underneath their underwear.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.359
So, one adds an extra layer of protection.

23:22.442 --> 23:23.985
It doesn't have to be denim, per se,

23:24.069 --> 23:26.822
but everybody wants to hide their privates
from something.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.407
Not everybody.

23:29.199 --> 23:30.992
- Can you show me?
- Oh, sure.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.661
- God, yeah.
- No, your program?

23:33.120 --> 23:34.955
The... The code that you wrote?

23:35.956 --> 23:38.166
<i>George Michael was as surprised</i>

23:38.250 --> 23:42.421
<i>as the courtroom was about to be
when the DA introduced a witness</i>

23:42.504 --> 23:45.173
<i>who would turn the whole case upside down</i>

23:45.257 --> 23:47.092
<i>with a sense of the dramatic.</i>

23:48.176 --> 23:51.555
Okay. Now, Warden Gentles,
you recently paid a visit

23:51.638 --> 23:54.224
to the Hollywood motion picture
director Ron Howard

23:54.307 --> 23:56.226
with information about the Bluth family

23:56.309 --> 23:58.812
you thought was pertinent
to a project he was working on

23:58.895 --> 24:00.355
about the Bluth family.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.566
- Isn't that correct?
- That is correct.

24:02.649 --> 24:04.776
- Oh, my God.
- This had to do with an incident

24:04.860 --> 24:07.028
in Buster Bluth's past, correct?

24:07.112 --> 24:08.822
Yes. It is so.

24:08.905 --> 24:11.658
And how exactly did you acquire
this information?

24:11.908 --> 24:16.121
Well, if I may be eloquent,
straight from the horse's mouth.

24:16.204 --> 24:17.706
And who is the horse?

24:20.417 --> 24:21.543
Lucille Bluth,

24:22.419 --> 24:23.920
of course, of course.

24:24.629 --> 24:27.174
But all that information
on that case

24:27.257 --> 24:30.927
- had been sealed.
- Well, all seals can come loose

24:31.011 --> 24:31.970
with a little bit of...

24:32.679 --> 24:34.306
Gentles' pressuring.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.477
<i>And Lucille herself had been</i>
<i>so loosened.</i>

24:38.560 --> 24:42.647
<i>Some months earlier,
Lucille had enticed Warden Gentles</i>

24:42.731 --> 24:44.566
<i>to a private dinner in order</i>

24:44.649 --> 24:48.445
<i>to get her son Buster released
for a Second of July parade.</i>

24:48.945 --> 24:51.740
<i>And through the course
of a well-served meal,</i>

24:52.991 --> 24:55.911
<i>and even more frequently served
bottles of wine,</i>

24:56.328 --> 25:00.582
<i>Lucille rekindled a friendship
in order to ask for a favor.</i>

25:00.665 --> 25:03.001
<i>But as the afternoon turned into evening,</i>

25:03.084 --> 25:05.420
<i>intimate details issued forth</i>

25:05.504 --> 25:08.340
<i>from a now-drunken Lucille's mouth.</i>

25:08.757 --> 25:10.509
<i>Information extremely useful</i>

25:10.592 --> 25:14.137
<i>to a warden with ambitions
of a screenwriting career,</i>

25:14.221 --> 25:17.140
<i>who had heard
about an Imagine streaming series</i>

25:17.224 --> 25:19.601
<i>about this exact family.</i>

25:19.976 --> 25:23.146
<i>So, while Lucille got her son out
for a parade,</i>

25:23.230 --> 25:25.857
<i>Warden Gentles got a lot more.</i>

25:26.441 --> 25:29.110
<i>In fact,
the only thing guarded that evening</i>

25:29.569 --> 25:32.113
<i>was Warden Gentles' private trailer.</i>

25:32.989 --> 25:35.575
And you shared these stories
with Ron Howard?

25:35.659 --> 25:37.369
- <i>He did.</i>
- I did.

25:38.078 --> 25:41.248
Exhibit 3-A, <i>Making of a Monster.</i>

25:41.998 --> 25:45.210
I would like to play a clip
of the season finale.

25:46.962 --> 25:50.924
<i>And so, they played much</i>
<i>of the Imagine Bluth project.</i>

25:51.007 --> 25:52.926
<i>Now, remember, this is really rough.</i>

25:53.009 --> 25:56.221
<i>And our location guy was only able
to rent out the cottage for shooting</i>

25:56.304 --> 25:58.765
<i>for, like, two days.
And it's all temp sound.</i>

25:58.848 --> 26:02.811
<i>- We haven't licensed most of this music.</i>
- What? What do you think you're doing?

26:03.144 --> 26:05.730
I told you. I'm taking this girl who,
in my opinion,

26:05.814 --> 26:07.440
has been mistreated by you
for far too long

26:07.524 --> 26:09.609
on a cruise with her grandmother.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.528
You're not taking her anywhere.

26:12.153 --> 26:13.572
Oh, come on, Mom.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.699
I <i>am </i> almost 14,

26:15.782 --> 26:18.702
- and you <i>have </i> been mistreating me.
- Oh...

26:19.327 --> 26:20.579
You go to your room.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.749
How dare you?

26:24.833 --> 26:27.294
We both know that child
is about to turn 18.

26:27.377 --> 26:29.963
- Oh, that's right, it slipped my mind.
- Oh, please.

26:30.046 --> 26:33.008
That's all you've been thinking about
since you put her up for adoption.

26:33.091 --> 26:34.884
<i>It hasn't been on your mind?</i>

26:36.428 --> 26:38.555
You swooped in and stole her
from the Standwells

26:38.638 --> 26:39.931
when you found out about the endowment,

26:40.015 --> 26:43.184
'cause you just had to have
a cottage on the beach.

26:44.394 --> 26:46.104
You can say goodbye to that, honey.

26:46.396 --> 26:47.606
Because that child is mine,

26:47.689 --> 26:49.899
and I have nothing else
in my life right now.

26:49.983 --> 26:51.526
<i>And I'm not gonna spend
the rest of it singing</i>

26:51.610 --> 26:53.445
<i>on a cruise ship for snifter tips.</i>

26:53.862 --> 26:55.447
<i>I knew this is</i>
<i>what you were up to.</i>

26:55.530 --> 26:57.240
Suddenly, there's no gentleman caller
in the picture,

26:57.324 --> 26:59.117
and you decide to look out for yourself?

26:59.200 --> 27:01.536
Oh, you're one to talk
about looking out for yourself.

27:01.620 --> 27:04.164
I've never been invited
to this place even once,

27:04.247 --> 27:05.749
and let's not forget who paid for it.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.752
And this is how
you want to be paid back?

27:08.835 --> 27:11.713
You think you're gonna walk
in here and take away my child?

27:11.796 --> 27:14.174
That's not your child.
That's my child, and we both know it.

27:15.133 --> 27:15.967
No.

27:16.217 --> 27:19.679
It's not true. I still have it!
I'll still wear my gentleman's collar!

27:19.763 --> 27:22.432
But you're not my mother.
Mother's my mother, Grandmother!

27:28.563 --> 27:30.523
<i>You know, it's funny,</i>
<i>I was actually worried</i>

27:30.607 --> 27:33.610
<i>about them showing this in court,
but it... it turned out better</i>

27:33.693 --> 27:34.944
<i>than I'd remembered.</i>

27:35.445 --> 27:37.364
<i>And I actually think
it's a good advertisement</i>

27:37.447 --> 27:38.490
<i>for the show.</i>

27:39.115 --> 27:41.409
<i>Of course,
we still haven't gotten Brian's notes.</i>

27:41.493 --> 27:43.828
<i>And obviously,
we're gonna put Jean Smart's face</i>

27:43.912 --> 27:46.539
<i>on the stuntman.</i>

27:51.086 --> 27:53.046
<i>And Cobie did a great job, too.</i>

27:53.129 --> 27:54.881
<i>You know,
I... I should send her something.</i>

27:55.465 --> 27:57.509
- Did you know about this?
- No.

27:57.592 --> 28:00.553
My dad made us give up Netflix
when they went up by two dollars.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.639
Is that an accurate depiction

28:02.722 --> 28:05.100
of what Lucille told you was a true story?

28:05.475 --> 28:08.436
I'm not just saying this
to suck up to Ron Howard,

28:09.062 --> 28:11.064
but I think we nailed it.

28:11.564 --> 28:13.692
So, Buster Bluth

28:13.775 --> 28:16.611
has killed before in the exact same manner

28:16.736 --> 28:18.446
he killed Lucille Austero!

28:18.822 --> 28:19.698
Wow.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.324
Prosecution rests.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.368
We will reconvene tomorrow.

28:23.451 --> 28:25.870
- Mistrial! Mistrial!
- Yes, yes!

28:25.954 --> 28:27.247
I missed your trial!

28:28.081 --> 28:30.250
So you sell me out to Warden Gentles?

28:30.542 --> 28:33.294
And we both know you said
I wouldn't get in trouble.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.297
- You made a promise!
- No, Buster, it was a mistake!

28:36.381 --> 28:39.134
You can live with her, Dusty.
She can be your mother.

28:39.592 --> 28:42.762
Now you made it almost impossible
for me to win this case.

28:43.179 --> 28:46.266
I mean, was that an option?
Because you did almost kill my dad.

28:46.349 --> 28:49.477
