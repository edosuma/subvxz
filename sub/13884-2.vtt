00:53.046 --> 00:55.765
<i>Awoogal Awoogal Abandon ship</i>

00:56.446 --> 00:59.882
But a black hole is a huge, impacted star.

01:00.046 --> 01:03.880
It's millions of miles wide.
Why didn't you see anything?

01:04.086 --> 01:06.361
Well, the thing about a black hole,

01:06.526 --> 01:09.404
its main distinguishing feature is it's black.

01:09.566 --> 01:12.319
And the thing about space, the colour of space,

01:12.486 --> 01:15.558
your basic space colour...is it's black.

01:15.726 --> 01:19.355
- How are you supposed to see them?
- But five.

01:19.526 --> 01:23.235
How can you be ambushed by five black holes?

01:24.486 --> 01:28.877
Always the way, innit?
You wait three million years and not one,

01:29.046 --> 01:31.799
then, suddenly, five turn up at once.

01:32.446 --> 01:34.721
Come on. We've only got 20 minutes.

01:34.886 --> 01:39.516
- Careful. Don't knock it.
- What did you bring this junk for?

01:39.686 --> 01:43.076
That ''junk'' happens
to be a Javanese camphor-wood chest.

01:43.246 --> 01:45.919
It was my father's and has my valuables in it.

01:46.126 --> 01:50.961
I never knew you had so much crap.
What's this? Toy soldiers?

01:51.526 --> 01:54.643
''Toy soldiers''?
They've been in our family for years.

01:54.806 --> 01:58.515
They're priceless replicas
of Napoleon's Armée du Nord.

01:58.726 --> 02:02.355
So you can't change the clothes
like you can with Sindy?

02:02.566 --> 02:07.640
- Look, we've got barely 15 minutes.
- What the smeg is this?!

02:07.926 --> 02:12.477
Just what little I've managed
to scrimp and scrape for a rainy day.

02:12.686 --> 02:16.440
- There must be 20 grand here.
- 24. Look, let's get off the ship.

02:16.646 --> 02:21.197
24,000? And you had the front
to borrow money off me

02:21.366 --> 02:24.278
to buy ME a birthday present!

02:24.926 --> 02:28.202
That's going back a bit. It was only 15 quid.

02:28.366 --> 02:34.123
Right, 15 quid. And what did I get?
A five-quid book token.

02:34.286 --> 02:37.722
Those cards aren't free. I had to fork out for that.

02:37.886 --> 02:40.161
You never even paid me back.

02:40.326 --> 02:43.318
You're tighter than an Italian waiter's keks.

02:44.246 --> 02:46.237
Blue Midget is loaded.

02:46.406 --> 02:48.874
- Aren't you ready?
- We'll catch you up.

02:49.046 --> 02:52.516
- Have you got everything?
- Just the bare essentials.

02:52.726 --> 02:55.559
I have the bare essentials, too - 36 outfits

02:55.726 --> 02:57.717
and ten full-length dress mirrors.

02:58.366 --> 03:01.119
Cat, we're going to be away for 12 hours.

03:01.806 --> 03:06.960
- You think I need more mirrors?
- Let's get out of here. Go, go, go!

03:11.686 --> 03:15.645
- I want a safe drive. No stunts.
- No worries.

03:22.046 --> 03:26.005
<i>OK, I'll navigate Red Dwarf</i>
<i>through the black holes.</i>

03:26.166 --> 03:29.203
<i>If all goes well,</i>
<i>we'll rendezvous on Sigma 14D.</i>

03:44.286 --> 03:47.119
- Please. They're priceless.
- I'm only having a goosie.

03:47.286 --> 03:50.278
If you get curry over them, how will that look?

03:50.446 --> 03:54.075
What would Baron Jaquinaux
of the First Cavalry Division be doing

03:54.246 --> 03:56.840
with meat vindaloo all over his tunic?

03:57.006 --> 04:01.522
It'll make him look more authentic.
People'll think he's got dysentery.

04:02.406 --> 04:04.840
You're obsessed with war, aren't you?

04:05.006 --> 04:07.759
You collect toy soldiers. You play war games.

04:07.926 --> 04:10.360
You read those stupid combat magazines.

04:10.526 --> 04:14.997
Half your books are about Patton
and Caesar and various other gits.

04:15.246 --> 04:17.396
It's about leadership. That's what I admire.

04:17.606 --> 04:21.838
It's just so ironic when, deep down,
you're such a natural coward.

04:22.766 --> 04:25.963
- Coward?!
- Planet leave. Miranda.

04:26.126 --> 04:28.117
That space bar. Remember that?

04:28.286 --> 04:30.481
When that fight started, you were gone

04:30.646 --> 04:33.843
quicker than a whippet with a bumful of dynamite.

04:34.046 --> 04:37.083
That was a bar room brawl, a common pub fight,

04:37.246 --> 04:39.282
a shambolic drunken set-to.

04:39.846 --> 04:42.360
Which you started.

04:42.806 --> 04:44.956
I just made an innocuous comment.

04:45.126 --> 04:48.118
I merely voiced the rumour
that MacWilliams was sexually tilted

04:48.286 --> 04:50.959
in favour of sleeping with the dead.

04:51.126 --> 04:53.686
I didn't start the rumour. I merely voiced it.

04:53.886 --> 04:56.844
To his face. Right to his face.

04:57.006 --> 04:59.918
When he was with his four biggest mates.

05:00.086 --> 05:03.556
Then you do a Roadrunner
and leave me to face the music.

05:03.766 --> 05:07.156
- I could've got hurt.
- You'd make a brilliant general.

05:07.366 --> 05:11.120
Generals don't smash chairs
over people's heads.

05:11.286 --> 05:13.880
They don't stick Newcastle Brown
bottles in your face

05:14.046 --> 05:16.958
and say, ''Stitch that, Jimmy.''

05:17.286 --> 05:21.757
Generals are in a tent on the hill,
sipping Sancerre, directing the battle.

05:21.926 --> 05:25.601
- They're men of honour.
- You make war sound romantic.

05:25.806 --> 05:29.515
I'll tell you something,
something I've never told anyone.

05:29.686 --> 05:35.158
When I was 15, I went on a trip to Macedonia
to Alexander the Great's palace.

05:35.326 --> 05:39.877
And for the first time
in my whole life, I felt I was home.

05:40.046 --> 05:42.560
This palace was where I belonged.

05:42.726 --> 05:47.277
Years later, I got friendly
with a hypnotherapist, Donald.

05:47.486 --> 05:52.719
I told him about it. He said
he could regress me back to past lives.

05:52.926 --> 05:55.440
I was dubious, but I let him do it.

05:56.006 --> 05:58.679
It turned out my instincts were absolutely correct.

05:58.846 --> 06:03.237
I had lived a past life in Macedonia.
That palace WAS my home.

06:03.406 --> 06:06.443
Because, Lister, believe it or not,

06:06.606 --> 06:10.076
he told me that in a previous incarnation,

06:10.246 --> 06:14.444
I was Alexander the Great's chief eunuch.

06:17.166 --> 06:20.283
Do you know something? I believe you.

06:21.046 --> 06:23.560
He didn't say
I was Alexander the Great himself,

06:23.726 --> 06:27.435
which is what I wanted to hear,
but it explained everything.

06:27.606 --> 06:30.678
I'd lived alongside
one of the greatest generals in history.

06:30.846 --> 06:34.759
- No wonder the military is in my blood.
- No wonder you're a good singer.

06:35.406 --> 06:38.443
Well, maybe it's tot, but even to this day,

06:38.606 --> 06:41.962
I can't look at a pair
of nutcrackers without wincing.

06:43.006 --> 06:45.759
And whenever I'm with a group of women,

06:45.926 --> 06:50.363
I have this overwhelming urge
to bathe them in warm olive oil.

06:50.566 --> 06:54.605
Rimmer, I have that urge.
It's got nothing to do with past lives.

06:56.206 --> 06:59.915
- Well, why is it, then?
- It's because you're unhappy.

07:00.086 --> 07:04.682
You're unhappy with your own boring,
humdrum, weaselly existence.

07:06.366 --> 07:10.837
You're looking for something
with a bit more - I don't know - glamour.

07:11.006 --> 07:13.395
Now is what counts, Rimmer, living for today.

07:13.686 --> 07:18.555
Who knows what'll happen tomorrow?
That's what makes life so exciting.

08:20.926 --> 08:25.522
Mayday. Mayday. Can you read me?
Come in, please. Can you read me?

08:29.446 --> 08:31.641
Still snowing, is it?

08:31.846 --> 08:35.441
It's useless. You can hardly stand up,
never mind dig it out.

08:35.645 --> 08:38.114
- No luck?
- Nothing's getting through.

08:38.326 --> 08:43.605
Three days. They must be looking for us
by now. Where the smeg are they?

08:43.806 --> 08:48.163
In this weather, they could be
ten feet away and walk past us.

08:48.366 --> 08:51.802
We're going to die, aren't we?
How much food is there?

08:52.006 --> 08:55.442
There's half a bag
of soggy smoky bacon crisps,

08:55.606 --> 09:00.361
a tin of mustard powder, three water biscuits,

09:00.526 --> 09:02.994
a brown lemon, two bottles of vinegar

09:03.166 --> 09:06.761
and a tube of Bonjela gum ointment.

09:08.286 --> 09:11.039
- Gum ointment?
- It was in the first-aid box.

09:11.206 --> 09:13.481
It's that minty flavour. It's quite nice.

09:14.046 --> 09:16.799
It's quite nice smeared on your mouth ulcer.

09:16.966 --> 09:20.197
- You can't eat it.
- You may have to.

09:20.406 --> 09:24.604
- That's it? There's nothing else?
- Just a Pot Noodle...

09:24.766 --> 09:27.280
Oh, and some dog food in the tool cupboard.

09:27.486 --> 09:29.841
Well, it's obvious what gets eaten last.

09:30.006 --> 09:32.315
I can't stand Pot Noodles.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.796
We're going to die, aren't we?
Correction, I'M going to die.

09:37.006 --> 09:39.679
You're already dead. You don't need food.

09:39.846 --> 09:42.758
- Did you find any wood?
- There's no wood out there.

09:42.926 --> 09:45.963
There's no vegetation out there.
Smeg all. Just a wasteland.

09:46.166 --> 09:49.078
You've got to keep this fire going.

09:49.286 --> 09:51.720
I'm going to die, aren't I?

09:51.886 --> 09:53.877
God, I'm hungry. I'm having the crisps.

09:54.046 --> 09:55.445
- No.
- Just one.

09:55.646 --> 09:58.001
You ate less than 16 hours ago.

09:59.286 --> 10:03.438
I had a raw sprout and that chewing gum
I found under the desk!

10:03.646 --> 10:06.843
You've got to pace yourself.
Go to sleep. Wait till tomorrow.

10:07.046 --> 10:11.358
It's OK for you. You don't need food.
You don't even feel the cold.

10:11.566 --> 10:15.036
Think of something else.
Try to take your mind off it.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.357
Mayday. Mayday.

10:18.846 --> 10:21.280
- I wonder they call it ''Mayday''?
- Eh?

10:21.446 --> 10:25.234
The distress call. Why ''Mayday''?
It's only a bank holiday.

10:25.406 --> 10:28.523
Why not Shrove Tuesday
or Ascension Sunday?

10:29.806 --> 10:32.115
Ascension Sunday. Ascension Sunday.

10:34.606 --> 10:38.201
The 15th Wednesday after Pentecost.
The 15th Wednesday after Pentecost.

10:39.206 --> 10:43.245
It's French, you doink. ''M'aidez.'' ''Help me.''

10:43.406 --> 10:45.966
- M-aid-ez.
- Is that right?

10:46.126 --> 10:48.435
Everywhere I look reminds me of food.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.756
Look at these books - Charles Lamb...

10:51.846 --> 10:53.837
Herman Wok...

10:54.646 --> 10:57.399
the complete works of Sir Francis Bacon...

10:57.566 --> 10:59.363
Eric Van Lustbader...

11:00.046 --> 11:03.243
Eric Van Lustbader?
What's he got to do with food?

11:03.446 --> 11:07.075
Van. Bread van. Meat van. Food!

11:07.606 --> 11:09.801
Look, you're getting obsessed.

11:09.966 --> 11:12.685
It's these books.
It's like they're here to taunt me.

11:12.846 --> 11:15.406
Look at this,
''The Caretaker'' by Harold Pint-er.

11:16.366 --> 11:18.357
It's Pinter.

11:18.526 --> 11:21.677
- Stop thinking about food.
- Take my mind off it.

11:21.846 --> 11:23.882
- Talk to me about something.
- What?

11:24.086 --> 11:26.759
- Anything.
- Erm...

11:26.926 --> 11:29.599
- Anything apart from food?
- Don't talk about food.

11:29.806 --> 11:35.199
- I can't think of another topic.
- Don't mention Topics. They're food!

11:35.366 --> 11:38.836
- Tell me a story. Any story.
- I don't know any stories.

11:40.726 --> 11:43.240
- Tell me how you lost your virginity.
- My what?

11:43.406 --> 11:47.160
- Talk to me.
- How I lost it?

11:48.526 --> 11:50.517
Well, it was so long ago.

11:50.686 --> 11:54.440
I was so young and sexually precocious,
I'm not sure I can remember.

11:54.646 --> 11:58.275
Everyone remembers that.
It's just one of those things.

11:58.446 --> 12:02.200
Like everyone remembers where they were
when Cliff Richard was shot...

12:04.486 --> 12:06.875
or when the first woman landed on Pluto,

12:07.046 --> 12:09.844
or when they put a gigantic toupee
over the Earth

12:10.006 --> 12:12.440
to cover the gap in the ozone layer.

12:12.606 --> 12:15.325
It's just one of those things you always remember.

12:15.526 --> 12:17.323
Well, I don't.

12:17.486 --> 12:21.445
You can hardly expect me to recall
every sexual liaison I've ever had.

12:21.606 --> 12:25.599
- What am I, the Memory Man?
- Rimmer, I want the truth.

12:26.526 --> 12:28.642
- The truth?
- Yeah.

12:30.246 --> 12:32.282
Not much to tell, really.

12:32.446 --> 12:35.358
I was always a fish out of water around women.

12:35.526 --> 12:38.643
Never know what to say to them.

12:39.806 --> 12:42.718
I wasn't very highly sexed, to be honest with you.

12:42.886 --> 12:47.357
I think it was all that cabbage
I was forced to eat as a boy.

12:47.526 --> 12:49.596
Still, the first time...

12:49.766 --> 12:54.123
The first time was this girl
I met at cadet school, Sandra.

12:54.286 --> 12:56.402
We did it in my brother's car.

12:56.606 --> 13:00.076
- What was it like?
- Brilliant. Incredible.

13:00.246 --> 13:02.237
Bentley V8 convertible.

13:03.966 --> 13:07.754
Walnut panelling.
Marvellous machine. Marvellous.

13:09.286 --> 13:13.438
- So, how did you lose yours?
- Michelle Fisher.

13:13.606 --> 13:16.279
The ninth hole
of the Bootle municipal golf course.

13:16.446 --> 13:19.563
Par four, dog-leg to the right, in the bunker.

13:19.766 --> 13:24.044
You lost your virginity on a golf course?
How did you have the nerve?

13:24.246 --> 13:28.444
It wasn't during the Ryder Cup
or anything. It was midnight.

13:28.646 --> 13:32.195
- How old were you?
- She was so good-looking.

13:32.366 --> 13:37.394
She could have got a job working
on the perfume counter at Lewis's.

13:37.606 --> 13:41.997
- How old were you?
- She just stood there completely naked.

13:42.166 --> 13:45.602
I was so excited,
I nearly dropped my skateboard.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.924
- Skateboard?! How old were you?
- Twelve.

13:49.566 --> 13:51.158
Twelve?!

13:52.366 --> 13:55.915
Twelve years old?! You lost your
virginity when you were twelve?!

13:58.766 --> 14:00.757
Twelve?!

14:02.246 --> 14:06.034
You can't have been a full member
of the golf club.

14:06.966 --> 14:08.957
Of course I wasn't!

14:09.486 --> 14:13.035
You did it on a golf course
and you weren't a member?!

14:13.206 --> 14:17.119
- Of course I wasn't.
- You didn't pay green fees?

14:18.366 --> 14:20.675
It was just a place to go.

14:21.966 --> 14:26.357
I used to play golf.
I hate people who abuse the facilities.

14:27.286 --> 14:30.437
I hope you raked the sand back
nicely before you left.

14:30.606 --> 14:32.881
That'd be some lie to get into.

14:33.046 --> 14:38.279
Competition the next day, your ball lands
in Lister's buttock crevice.

14:38.446 --> 14:41.244
You'd need more than a niblick
to get that out.

14:41.446 --> 14:44.563
- Are you saying I've got a big bum?
- Big?

14:44.726 --> 14:47.160
It's like two badly parked Volkswagens.

14:50.286 --> 14:53.437
All I ever lost when I was 12 were my shoes

14:53.606 --> 14:57.042
with the compass in the heel
and animal-track soles.

14:57.206 --> 15:00.960
Porky Roebuck threw them in the septic tank
behind the sports ground.

15:01.126 --> 15:03.117
I cried for weeks.

15:03.286 --> 15:05.481
I was wearing them.

15:06.606 --> 15:09.279
I never even thought about sex when I was 12.

15:09.486 --> 15:14.401
Maybe that's because you
were Alexander the Great's chief eunuch.

15:14.806 --> 15:17.400
- What are you doing?
- There's nothing left to burn.

15:17.606 --> 15:20.678
- Don't burn my books!
- There's nothing else left.

15:20.846 --> 15:23.963
But it's obscene. A book is a thing of beauty.

15:24.126 --> 15:26.640
The voice of freedom, the essence of civilisation.

15:26.846 --> 15:29.280
''Biggles Learns to Fly''?

15:30.526 --> 15:32.881
Well, perhaps not that one.

15:33.086 --> 15:35.441
''The Complete Works of Shakespeare.''

15:35.606 --> 15:37.801
This'll be good for a few hours.

15:37.966 --> 15:41.641
Three days without food,
and civilisation comes tumbling down.

15:41.846 --> 15:43.837
What are you on about?

15:44.006 --> 15:47.681
They say that any society
is three meals away from revolution.

15:47.846 --> 15:51.634
Deprive a culture of food for three meals
and you'll have anarchy.

15:51.806 --> 15:56.038
It's true. You've gone without food
for two days and become a barbarian.

15:56.206 --> 15:59.596
- I'm just burning a book.
- It's not just a book.

15:59.766 --> 16:02.838
It's the only copy of the greatest
work in English literature.

16:03.006 --> 16:05.281
Probably the only copy left in the universe,

16:05.446 --> 16:09.121
and you'd chuck it on the fire
to keep warm for 15 minutes.

16:09.286 --> 16:11.516
There's nothing left to burn.

16:11.686 --> 16:14.325
That's it, then, is it? Toodle-pip, King Lear.

16:14.486 --> 16:17.159
Farewell, Macbeth. Bye-bye, Hamlet.

16:17.926 --> 16:20.599
Have you ever actually read any of it?

16:21.766 --> 16:24.883
I've seen ''West Side Story''. That's based on one.

16:26.046 --> 16:29.595
Have you actually read any of it?

16:29.766 --> 16:31.757
Not all the way through, no.

16:31.926 --> 16:33.996
- But I can quote some.
- Go on, then.

16:41.206 --> 16:43.003
''Now...''

16:44.486 --> 16:46.716
That's all I can remember.

16:48.646 --> 16:51.206
- What's that from?
- ''Richard III'', you moron.

16:51.366 --> 16:55.041
The brilliant ''now'' speech he does.
''Now...something, something.''

16:55.206 --> 16:57.515
It's brilliant. Unforgettable.

16:58.886 --> 17:02.765
I'll save it till last. Is it OK if I burn ''Lolita''?

17:02.966 --> 17:05.161
Save page 61.

17:07.326 --> 17:10.318
- That bit.
- That's disgusting.

17:38.206 --> 17:41.004
You can take that look off your face.

17:41.166 --> 17:44.636
- I'm just trying to stay alive.
- You're eating dog food.

17:46.046 --> 17:49.641
Yeah. I haven't eaten for six days.
I'm eating dog food.

17:49.846 --> 17:52.406
I'm sure the dog food will be lovely.

17:53.966 --> 17:59.165
This isn't dog food. It's a prime
fillet steak in blue cheese sauce.

17:59.326 --> 18:03.717
It's been charcoal-broiled in garlic
and is going to taste delicious.

18:03.886 --> 18:06.525
Delicious... Delicious...

18:13.886 --> 18:17.799
Well, now I know
why dogs lick their testicles.

18:22.926 --> 18:25.679
It's to take away the taste of the food.

18:27.486 --> 18:30.478
The stove's getting low.
Better throw another book on.

18:30.686 --> 18:33.359
- That's the last.
- You've burnt all of them?

18:33.566 --> 18:37.878
When we get to Act Five
of ''Henry VIII'', I'm a dead man.

18:39.006 --> 18:41.804
There must be something else to burn.

18:47.606 --> 18:50.404
Not the trunk. It's Javanese
camphor wood. It's priceless.

18:50.606 --> 18:53.279
There's only the trunk and what's inside.

18:53.486 --> 18:56.842
Wait a minute! Not Napoleon's Armée du Nord.

18:57.006 --> 18:59.201
Rimmer, get real, man. What's important?

18:59.926 --> 19:03.202
If it burns, we burn it. What's the least valuable?

19:03.366 --> 19:05.436
Not the trunk. My father gave me that.

19:05.646 --> 19:08.080
- The soldiers, then.
- They're 19th-century.

19:08.246 --> 19:11.602
Irreplaceable. They were hand-carved
by the legendary Dubois brothers.

19:11.806 --> 19:13.876
Well, then?

19:17.966 --> 19:19.957
Better start unpacking the soldiers.

19:20.126 --> 19:23.914
No. There must be something else
to burn. There must be.

19:24.086 --> 19:28.557
There isn't. I looked.
Look, I know it must be a bummer.

19:28.726 --> 19:31.843
I know it must be heartbreaking,
but it's just stuff.

19:32.006 --> 19:34.918
It's just possessions. They're only things.

19:35.086 --> 19:37.236
In the end, they're not important.

19:37.406 --> 19:40.762
They might go for a bundle
in some swanky Islington antique shop,

19:40.926 --> 19:45.442
but right here and now,
all they are is nicely painted firewood.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.400
This isn't happening. It's a nightmare.

19:49.846 --> 19:51.962
You've got to get your priorities right.

19:52.126 --> 19:55.357
It's like people
who run back into a burning house

19:55.526 --> 19:59.280
to rescue some piece of furniture
and wind up burning to death.

19:59.806 --> 20:02.001
Nothing's more important than a human life...

20:02.166 --> 20:05.203
-What about your guitar?
- ..except my guitar.

20:05.406 --> 20:08.637
Why didn't we think of it before?
We'll burn your guitar.

20:08.846 --> 20:11.406
- Not my guitar.
- It's made of wood.

20:11.606 --> 20:15.042
Yeah, but it's my guitar.
I've had it since I was 16.

20:15.206 --> 20:17.401
That is an authentic Les Paul copy.

20:17.606 --> 20:20.723
But it's not worth anything.
It's just a thing, a possession.

20:20.926 --> 20:24.805
- Yeah, but it's mine.
- How is it different from MY soldiers?

20:25.006 --> 20:28.396
That's my lifeline. I need that guitar.

20:29.126 --> 20:33.881
I mean, when it gets to me...
I mean, the loneliness and all that...

20:34.046 --> 20:38.198
When it gets on top of me,
it's my only means of escape.

20:38.366 --> 20:41.244
I know I'm not exactly a wizard on it.

20:41.406 --> 20:45.319
I know it's only got five strings
and three of them are G...

20:45.486 --> 20:48.922
but I've never had anything to cling onto -

20:49.086 --> 20:51.475
no roots, no parents, no education...

20:51.686 --> 20:54.758
- No education?
- I went to art college.

20:55.446 --> 20:57.596
All I've ever had is that guitar.

20:57.766 --> 21:01.759
It's the only thing in my whole life
that hasn't walked out on me.

21:01.926 --> 21:03.917
Don't make me burn it.

21:07.086 --> 21:09.077
We've got to.

21:15.646 --> 21:18.479
Look, I know
this might sound stupid, like, but...

21:18.646 --> 21:22.958
can I just play one song on it,
just one for the road?

21:23.166 --> 21:25.361
Sure, sure.
I mean, I'm not enjoying this.

21:25.526 --> 21:28.120
I know, man. Thanks.

21:34.846 --> 21:37.758
# She's out of my life

21:38.766 --> 21:43.044
# I don't know
whether to laugh or cry... #

21:44.006 --> 21:46.236
My step-dad taught me this one.

21:46.406 --> 21:49.079
It's the first song I ever learned to play.

21:49.766 --> 21:53.725
- I'm just going to, er...
- # I don't know whether to live or die

21:53.886 --> 21:56.446
# She's out of my...

21:58.286 --> 22:00.277
# Life #

22:59.126 --> 23:02.516
- I don't know what to say.
- There's nothing to say.

23:02.686 --> 23:06.520
You've made a supreme sacrifice.
You know that?

23:06.686 --> 23:10.076
- A supreme sacrifice.
- It had to be done.

23:10.286 --> 23:13.164
I've been judging the book by its cover, haven't I?

23:13.326 --> 23:15.601
All these years, that's what I've been doing.

23:15.766 --> 23:18.997
When it comes down to it, you're one regular guy.

23:20.766 --> 23:23.917
Don't be modest.
I know what that guitar meant to you.

23:24.566 --> 23:28.559
It means exactly the same
as that trunk means to me.

23:29.726 --> 23:34.322
If that trunk got so much as scratched,
I would be devastated.

23:35.286 --> 23:39.837
It's not the outward value.
To me, that trunk is a link to the past,

23:40.006 --> 23:42.804
to the father I never squared things with...

23:43.006 --> 23:47.318
- Is it?
- That trunk is all he ever gave me,

23:47.486 --> 23:49.920
apart from...apart from his disappointment.

23:53.206 --> 23:56.721
You've shown me, by burning your guitar,
what true value is.

23:58.006 --> 24:03.205
Decency. Self-sacrifice. Those are
the things that make up real wealth,

24:03.366 --> 24:06.881
and from where I'm standing,
I'm a pretty rich man.

24:07.806 --> 24:10.115
- Oh, God.
- Burn the soldiers.

24:10.326 --> 24:14.558
- Not the soldiers, as well.
- I want to make a sacrifice, too.

24:14.726 --> 24:17.479
Burn the Armée du Nord. Cast them to the flames.

24:17.646 --> 24:20.877
Let them lay down their lives
for the sake of friendship.

24:24.726 --> 24:28.799
- What's that smell?
- What smell? I can't smell any smell.

24:29.486 --> 24:31.078
Camphor wood.

24:37.606 --> 24:39.995
Your guitar was made of camphor wood.

24:41.966 --> 24:46.118
It must have been worth a fortune.
Burn the soldiers right now.

24:55.446 --> 24:59.917
Look, there they are. Mush! Mush!

25:26.046 --> 25:29.118
Au revoir, mes amis. À bientôt.

25:29.606 --> 25:33.235
Rimmer, there's something
I've got to tell you, something awful.

25:33.446 --> 25:36.961
If it's about finishing off the dog food,
I understand.

25:37.126 --> 25:41.802
- No, it's not about that...
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Oooooow!

25:42.006 --> 25:44.474
- Cat! Kryten!
- We made it!

25:44.646 --> 25:48.878
- Food! You brought food!
- So, where have you been?

25:49.086 --> 25:52.203
We rendezvoused with Holly.
When you didn't show up,

25:52.366 --> 25:55.676
- I said we should look for you.
- We've been everywhere.

25:55.846 --> 25:58.314
Fourteen moons, two planets.
I've been so worried,

25:58.486 --> 26:00.716
I haven't buffed my shoes for days.

26:01.566 --> 26:04.239
So, Holly navigated through five black holes?

26:04.446 --> 26:07.040
As it transpired, there weren't any black holes.

26:07.246 --> 26:10.204
- They were on the monitor.
- They weren't black holes.

26:10.406 --> 26:13.364
- What were they?
- Grit.

26:17.206 --> 26:20.562
Five specks of grit on the scanner-scope.

26:20.726 --> 26:23.081
See, the thing about grit is it's black,

26:23.246 --> 26:25.237
and the thing about scanner-scopes...

26:25.446 --> 26:28.597
- Oh, shut up.
- Let's go.

26:28.806 --> 26:32.958
Something happened here, Kryten.
Something that made us closer.

26:33.126 --> 26:37.517
I saw a side of Dave Lister
that I never knew existed.

26:37.686 --> 26:42.157
He's not an irresponsible, selfish drifter,
always out for number one.

26:42.326 --> 26:44.794
He's a man. A man of honour.

26:47.206 --> 26:49.003
Excuse me.

27:10.366 --> 27:12.561
Open the trunk.

27:24.006 --> 27:28.238
Kryten, get the hacksaw and follow me.

27:28.406 --> 27:30.397
Where are we going?

27:30.566 --> 27:35.560
We're going to do to Lister
what Alexander the Great once did to me.
