WEBVTT

00:05.778 --> 00:08.026
We have
suffered at each other's hands.

00:08.693 --> 00:11.402
We have lost people
we love at each other's hands.

00:14.277 --> 00:16.117
This isn't about noble houses,

00:16.444 --> 00:18.736
this is about the living
and the dead.

00:18.819 --> 00:20.444
And I intend to stay
amongst the living.

00:22.194 --> 00:23.819
I offer you a choice.

00:24.027 --> 00:25.527
Bend the knee and join me,

00:25.819 --> 00:27.736
or refuse, and die.

00:32.027 --> 00:34.277
She is here to reclaim
the Seven Kingdoms.

00:34.486 --> 00:36.444
The North is one of
those seven kingdoms.

00:38.527 --> 00:41.277
The Night King's army
grows larger by the day.

00:45.235 --> 00:47.486
We need allies. Powerful allies.

00:53.611 --> 00:55.171
The monsters are real.

00:56.277 --> 00:59.110
Dragons, White Walkers,
Dothraki screamers...

01:00.361 --> 01:01.653
Let the monsters
kill each other.

01:02.027 --> 01:03.861
We will deal with
whatever is left.

01:07.277 --> 01:09.128
We are going
to destroy the Night King

01:09.152 --> 01:11.110
and his army,
and we'll do it together.

01:12.653 --> 01:15.319
He pledged to fight
for Daenerys Targaryen.

01:15.611 --> 01:16.611
He's bent the knee.

01:17.069 --> 01:18.778
He needs to know the truth.

01:21.486 --> 01:23.194
Jon isn't really
my father's son.

01:23.778 --> 01:25.653
He's the son of
Rhaegar Targaryen,

01:25.861 --> 01:27.486
and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.361
He's the heir to
the Iron Throne.

01:30.944 --> 01:32.319
We need to tell him.

01:37.444 --> 01:39.944
The same thing
is coming for all of us...

01:42.985 --> 01:44.027
And it is here.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074

06:25.985 --> 06:27.903
You should
consider yourself lucky.

06:29.444 --> 06:31.277
At least your balls
won't freeze off.

06:31.361 --> 06:33.486
You take great
offense at dwarf jokes,

06:33.569 --> 06:36.110
but love telling eunuch jokes.
Why is that?

06:37.361 --> 06:40.277
Because I have balls,
and you don't.

07:07.819 --> 07:09.319
I warned you.

07:09.402 --> 07:12.152
Northerners don't much trust
outsiders.

08:33.778 --> 08:35.318
Look at you.

08:36.486 --> 08:37.736
You're a man.

08:38.736 --> 08:39.778
Almost.

08:59.444 --> 09:02.319
- Where's Arya?
- Lurking somewhere.

09:08.944 --> 09:11.402
Queen Daenerys
of House Targaryen.

09:12.694 --> 09:16.527
My sister, Sansa Stark,
the Lady of Winterfell.

09:16.611 --> 09:19.569
Thank you for inviting us
into your home, Lady Stark.

09:19.653 --> 09:21.027
The North is as beautiful

09:21.110 --> 09:24.444
as your brother claimed,
as are you.

09:27.944 --> 09:30.319
Winterfell is yours,
Your Grace.

09:31.778 --> 09:33.611
We don't have time
for all this.

09:33.694 --> 09:37.486
The Night King has your dragon.
He's one of them now.

09:38.486 --> 09:39.944
The Wall has fallen,

09:40.027 --> 09:42.194
the dead march south.

09:47.486 --> 09:49.402
As soon as we
heard about the Wall,

09:49.486 --> 09:52.611
I called all our banners
to retreat to Winterfell.

09:53.861 --> 09:54.861
Lord Umber...

09:56.194 --> 09:59.152
when can we expect
your people to arrive?

10:03.361 --> 10:07.319
We need more horses and wagons,
if it please my lady.

10:09.653 --> 10:11.277
And my lord.

10:13.611 --> 10:17.110
And my queen.
Sorry.

10:17.194 --> 10:19.152
You'll have as
many as we can spare.

10:19.235 --> 10:22.444
Hurry back to Last Hearth
and bring your people here.

10:25.361 --> 10:28.152
We need to send ravens
to the Night's Watch as well.

10:28.235 --> 10:30.694
There's no sense in
manning the castles anymore.

10:30.778 --> 10:31.861
We make our stand here.

10:31.944 --> 10:33.027
At once, Your Grace.

10:34.027 --> 10:35.569
"Your Grace."

10:41.194 --> 10:43.069
But you're not. Are you?

10:44.027 --> 10:45.527
You left Winterfell a king

10:45.611 --> 10:47.027
and came back a...

10:49.527 --> 10:51.486
I'm not sure
what you are now.

10:51.569 --> 10:54.110
A lord?

10:54.194 --> 10:56.486
Nothing at all?

10:56.569 --> 10:58.778
- It's not important.
- Not important?

10:59.944 --> 11:02.152
We named you
King in the North.

11:03.736 --> 11:05.235
King of the North!

11:10.361 --> 11:12.110
You did, my lady.

11:13.653 --> 11:15.486
It was the honor of my life.

11:15.569 --> 11:18.277
I'll always be grateful
for your faith.

11:20.402 --> 11:21.653
But when I left Winterfell,

11:21.736 --> 11:24.402
I told you
we need allies or we will die.

11:25.569 --> 11:27.277
I have brought
those allies home

11:27.361 --> 11:29.444
to fight alongside us.

11:30.736 --> 11:32.402
I had a choice,

11:32.486 --> 11:36.527
keep my crown
or protect the North.

11:36.611 --> 11:38.486
I chose the North.

11:50.861 --> 11:53.194
If anyone survives
the war to come,

11:53.277 --> 11:54.944
we'll have Jon Snow to thank.

11:56.402 --> 11:58.861
He risked his life
to show us the threat is real.

11:58.944 --> 12:00.736
Thanks to his courage,

12:00.819 --> 12:02.861
we have brought with us
the greatest army

12:02.944 --> 12:04.027
the world has ever seen.

12:04.110 --> 12:07.319
We have brought
two full-grown dragons.

12:09.486 --> 12:10.861
And soon, the Lannister army

12:10.944 --> 12:13.027
will ride north
to join our cause.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.152
I know, I know,
our people

12:19.235 --> 12:21.819
haven't been friends
in the past.

12:24.152 --> 12:25.861
But we must
fight together now...

12:26.985 --> 12:27.985
or die.

12:30.027 --> 12:32.486
May I ask,
how are we meant to feed

12:32.569 --> 12:34.527
the greatest army
the world has ever seen?

12:34.611 --> 12:37.235
While I ensured our stores
would last through winter,

12:37.319 --> 12:39.069
I didn't account for Dothraki,

12:39.152 --> 12:42.861
Unsullied
and two full-grown dragons.

12:44.486 --> 12:46.486
What do dragons eat, anyway?

12:48.653 --> 12:49.985
Whatever they want.

13:08.444 --> 13:12.277
Hey, careful, lads.
We need every last bit of it.

13:12.361 --> 13:13.653
Sorry 'bout that.

13:17.861 --> 13:19.486
Are these the last
of the wagons?

13:19.569 --> 13:20.985
Aye.

13:21.069 --> 13:23.694
All right, let's
get it all to the forges.

13:31.694 --> 13:32.694
My lord.

13:34.861 --> 13:35.861
My lady.

13:42.486 --> 13:43.527
My lady.

13:55.527 --> 13:56.944
The Lady of Winterfell.

13:58.778 --> 14:00.736
Has a nice ring to it.

14:00.819 --> 14:02.694
So does Hand of the Queen.

14:03.985 --> 14:06.027
Depending on the queen,
I suppose.

14:08.736 --> 14:11.444
Last time we spoke
was at Joffrey's wedding.

14:12.736 --> 14:15.527
- Miserable affair.
- It had its moments.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.527
Apologies
for leaving like that.

14:23.611 --> 14:25.152
Yes,
it was a bit hard to explain

14:25.235 --> 14:27.985
why my wife fled
moments after the king's murder.

14:30.569 --> 14:31.778
We both survived.

14:34.736 --> 14:36.444
Many underestimated you.

14:37.694 --> 14:39.277
Most of them are dead now.

14:47.235 --> 14:48.944
I'm sure
you weren't thrilled to hear

14:49.027 --> 14:50.903
the Lannister
army's marching north.

14:53.069 --> 14:56.194
You have every right
to be fearful of my sister.

14:56.277 --> 14:57.736
No one fears her
more than I do.

14:57.819 --> 15:00.736
- But I promise, you'll be safe...
- Cersei told you her army

15:00.819 --> 15:03.569
was coming north
to fight for you?

15:03.653 --> 15:04.653
She did.

15:06.277 --> 15:07.694
And you believed her?

15:09.110 --> 15:10.819
She has something
to live for now.

15:10.903 --> 15:13.694
I believe she wants to survive.

15:16.152 --> 15:18.653
I used to think you were
the cleverest man alive.

15:50.653 --> 15:52.319
You used to be taller.

15:55.110 --> 15:56.653
How did you sneak up on me?

15:56.736 --> 15:59.569
How did you survive
a knife through the heart?

15:59.653 --> 16:01.152
I didn't.

16:19.486 --> 16:20.736
You still have it.

16:23.944 --> 16:25.152
Needle.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.069
Have you ever used it?

16:29.985 --> 16:31.736
Once or twice.

16:47.069 --> 16:48.903
Valyrian steel.

16:50.486 --> 16:51.486
Jealous?

16:51.527 --> 16:54.694
Too heavy for me.

17:02.861 --> 17:04.736
Where were you before?

17:04.819 --> 17:07.527
I could've used your help
with Sansa.

17:09.569 --> 17:11.778
She doesn't like your queen,
does she?

17:11.861 --> 17:14.611
Sansa thinks
she's smarter than everyone.

17:15.944 --> 17:17.984
She's the smartest person
I've ever met.

17:19.361 --> 17:20.653
Now you're defending her?

17:20.736 --> 17:22.109
You?

17:23.444 --> 17:25.234
I'm defending our family.

17:26.611 --> 17:27.778
So is she.

17:27.861 --> 17:29.277
Yeah.

17:30.736 --> 17:32.319
I'm her family too.

17:38.361 --> 17:39.611
Don't forget that.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.819
Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring
terrible news.

18:01.985 --> 18:03.985
The dead have
broken through the Wall.

18:07.611 --> 18:08.861
Good.

18:43.069 --> 18:45.444
Why don't you just
get it over with and kill me?

18:45.527 --> 18:48.486
But we're family.

18:49.694 --> 18:52.444
The last Greyjoys
left in the world.

18:55.361 --> 18:57.611
The last ones
with balls anyway.

19:02.569 --> 19:03.903
If I kill you...

19:05.361 --> 19:06.861
who can I talk to?

19:07.778 --> 19:09.152
Hmm?

19:11.694 --> 19:14.027
I've got a crew full of mutes.

19:17.361 --> 19:19.069
It gets lonely at sea.

19:21.819 --> 19:23.736
Are we in King's Landing?

19:23.819 --> 19:24.903
Mm.

19:29.444 --> 19:31.569
You picked the losing side.

19:35.235 --> 19:37.903
Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet
somewhere else.

19:44.985 --> 19:47.903
But first
I'm gonna fuck the queen.

20:01.444 --> 20:03.194
Twenty-thousand men, is it?

20:03.277 --> 20:06.319
Yes, Your Grace.
A few died in transit.

20:08.611 --> 20:10.110
They cheated at dice.

20:12.069 --> 20:14.027
Or maybe I cheated.

20:14.110 --> 20:15.235
Someone cheated.

20:17.319 --> 20:19.861
They weren't good fighters.
You won't miss them.

20:19.944 --> 20:21.861
- Horses?
- Two thousand.

20:21.944 --> 20:23.194
And elephants?

20:23.277 --> 20:25.653
Uh, no
elephants, Your Grace.

20:27.277 --> 20:28.444
That's disappointing.

20:29.819 --> 20:31.985
I was told the Golden Company
had elephants.

20:32.069 --> 20:34.444
They are excellent
beasts, Your Grace,

20:34.527 --> 20:38.027
but not well-suited
to long sea voyages.

20:38.110 --> 20:39.653
In any event,
you are most welcome

20:39.736 --> 20:41.903
here in King's Landing,
Captain Strickland.

20:41.985 --> 20:45.194
We look forward to fighting
on your behalf, Your Grace.

20:56.152 --> 20:57.819
Am I most welcome here?

20:59.319 --> 21:01.944
You are a true friend
of the crown

21:02.027 --> 21:03.903
and an honored guest.

21:03.985 --> 21:05.235
Good.

21:05.319 --> 21:08.361
As a true friend
and an honored guest...

21:17.194 --> 21:20.361
I was hoping
we could talk in private.

21:21.569 --> 21:23.778
After the war.
That was our agreement.

21:23.861 --> 21:27.694
Wars sometimes last years.

21:28.861 --> 21:31.361
You want a whore, buy one.

21:33.152 --> 21:34.527
You want a queen...

21:35.819 --> 21:37.527
earn her.

21:40.402 --> 21:41.402
How?

21:42.486 --> 21:43.819
I've given her justice,

21:43.903 --> 21:46.611
an army
and the Iron Fleet,

21:46.694 --> 21:49.736
yet she gives me
no sign of affection.

21:50.694 --> 21:52.861
My heart is nearly broken.

21:55.152 --> 21:56.402
You're insolent.

21:58.110 --> 22:02.527
- I've executed men for less.
- They were lesser men.

22:41.319 --> 22:44.235
I hear the dragon burnt
up a thousand Lannister men.

22:44.319 --> 22:46.235
Burnt up some
of my favorite boys.

22:46.319 --> 22:47.985
- Archie, was it?
- And William.

22:48.069 --> 22:51.069
- Tall handsome William?
- Yeah, tall handsome William.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.819
They said what's left of him
could fit in a wine glass.

22:53.903 --> 22:57.361
I am the only man you ever met
who shot a dragon.

22:57.444 --> 22:59.194
- Did you?
- Nearly killed it.

22:59.277 --> 23:00.277
That's brave.

23:10.569 --> 23:13.110
- That boy Eddie...
- The ginger?

23:13.194 --> 23:16.361
That's him. Came back
with his face burnt right off.

23:16.444 --> 23:17.694
He's got no eyelids now.

23:17.778 --> 23:19.402
How does he sleep
with no eyelids?

23:19.486 --> 23:21.985
All right, can we stop talking
about the fucking dragons now?

23:22.069 --> 23:23.944
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

23:26.152 --> 23:27.235
You're kidding me.

23:27.319 --> 23:28.736
Apologies
for the interruption,

23:28.819 --> 23:31.152
but the queen
did urge me to hurry.

23:33.569 --> 23:34.778
Sorry, ladies.

23:36.819 --> 23:38.361
Another time perhaps.

23:46.069 --> 23:49.819
You ever get lonely,
I am partial to older gentlemen.

23:52.861 --> 23:56.110
Poor girl. The pox will take her
within the year.

23:57.736 --> 23:59.736
- Which girl?
- The queen's brothers

23:59.819 --> 24:02.444
made promises to you
and broke them.

24:02.527 --> 24:04.819
Her Grace wants to rectify
their mistake.

24:06.527 --> 24:08.944
She once gave me
a castle and a wife,

24:09.027 --> 24:10.694
then rectified me
right out of them.

24:10.778 --> 24:13.069
That was Ser Jaime's doing,
not hers.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.027
When Queen Cersei
wants something,

24:15.110 --> 24:16.903
she pays in advance
and in gold.

24:16.985 --> 24:18.736
Several chests of it, in fact.

24:18.819 --> 24:22.027
Waiting for you
in a wagon just outside.

24:26.611 --> 24:31.444
So she wants to murder someone,
but she can't send her soldiers.

24:31.527 --> 24:33.611
If it's the Dragon Queen
she's after...

24:33.694 --> 24:35.778
She has other plans
for the Targaryen girl.

24:35.861 --> 24:37.944
Yeah, well,
good luck with that.

24:38.027 --> 24:39.861
Our queen's brothers
are unlikely

24:39.944 --> 24:42.277
to survive
their Northern adventures.

24:42.361 --> 24:44.694
But in the event
that they do...

24:51.235 --> 24:54.903
She has a keen sense
of poetic justice.

24:56.152 --> 24:57.985
That fucking family.

24:58.069 --> 24:59.819
When the Citadel expelled me,

24:59.903 --> 25:01.736
I thought I would die
poor and alone,

25:01.819 --> 25:05.819
but in exchange for my service,
Queen Cersei made me her Hand.

25:05.903 --> 25:07.778
What would she do
for the man

25:07.861 --> 25:10.235
who rids her
of her treasonous brothers?

25:26.361 --> 25:28.736
I wanted those elephants.

25:34.819 --> 25:35.819
So...

25:37.611 --> 25:41.611
how do I compare
to the fat king?

25:42.611 --> 25:44.444
You're insulting
my late husband?

25:44.527 --> 25:45.778
Are you offended?

25:50.361 --> 25:53.027
Robert had a different whore
every night,

25:53.110 --> 25:56.110
but he still didn't know
his way around a woman's body.

25:57.069 --> 25:58.152
And the Kingslayer?

26:03.736 --> 26:05.778
You enjoy risking your neck,
don't you?

26:07.444 --> 26:08.611
Life is boring.

26:08.694 --> 26:11.819
You're not boring,
I'll give you that.

26:23.819 --> 26:25.778
Do I please the queen?

26:27.235 --> 26:30.611
You might be the most
arrogant man I've ever met.

26:32.778 --> 26:34.152
I like that.

26:36.027 --> 26:38.486
But now I want to be alone.

26:44.944 --> 26:47.778
I'm going to put
a prince in your belly.

28:22.069 --> 28:24.694
Euron can't defend
the Iron Islands,

28:24.778 --> 28:28.277
not if he's in King's Landing
with all his men and his ships.

28:29.402 --> 28:31.027
We can take our home back.

28:31.110 --> 28:32.611
Daenerys went north.

28:32.694 --> 28:34.611
Daenerys will need
somewhere to retreat

28:34.694 --> 28:36.235
if they can't hold the North.

28:36.319 --> 28:39.069
Somewhere the dead can't go.

28:44.361 --> 28:47.611
You're my queen.
I go where you command.

28:52.527 --> 28:54.527
You want to go to Winterfell.

28:54.611 --> 28:56.110
To fight for the Starks.

28:59.985 --> 29:00.985
Go.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.861
What is dead may never die.

29:11.361 --> 29:13.319
What is dead may never die.

29:18.027 --> 29:20.277
But kill the bastards
anyway.

29:48.069 --> 29:49.736
Welcome back, my lady.

29:51.027 --> 29:52.444
If you'd follow me...

29:52.527 --> 29:53.736
The Karstarks.

29:53.819 --> 29:55.985
One of the better sigils.

29:57.152 --> 29:58.527
Beats an onion, anyway.

30:00.027 --> 30:01.611
Can't argue with that.

30:01.694 --> 30:03.819
Not so long ago,
the Starks and the Karstarks

30:03.903 --> 30:06.277
were slaughtering each other
on the battlefield.

30:06.361 --> 30:08.361
Jon Snow brought peace
to the houses.

30:08.444 --> 30:10.402
And our queen is grateful.

30:10.486 --> 30:13.736
Her gratitude is lovely,
but that's not my point.

30:13.819 --> 30:16.861
The Northmen are loyal
to Jon Snow, not to her.

30:16.944 --> 30:18.027
They don't know her.

30:18.110 --> 30:20.444
The Free Folk don't know her.

30:20.527 --> 30:23.361
I've been up here a while,
and I'm telling you,

30:23.444 --> 30:25.277
they're stubborn as goats.

30:25.361 --> 30:27.985
You want their loyalty,
you have to earn it.

30:39.402 --> 30:41.903
I sense that you're leading
to a proposal.

30:43.069 --> 30:45.694
A proposal
is what I'm proposing.

30:45.778 --> 30:49.152
On the off chance
that we survive the Night King,

30:49.235 --> 30:50.778
what if the Seven Kingdoms,

30:50.861 --> 30:53.277
for once
in their whole shit history,

30:53.361 --> 30:56.903
were ruled by a just woman
and an honorable man?

30:59.361 --> 31:01.194
They do make a handsome couple.

31:01.277 --> 31:03.027
You overestimate
our influence.

31:03.110 --> 31:06.486
Jon and Daenerys don't want
to listen to lonely old men.

31:06.569 --> 31:08.277
I'm not that old.

31:09.569 --> 31:10.985
Not as old as him.

31:12.778 --> 31:15.152
Our queen
respects the wisdom of age.

31:15.235 --> 31:16.611
Of course she does.

31:16.694 --> 31:19.444
Respect is how the young
keep us at a distance,

31:19.527 --> 31:23.027
so we don't remind them
of an unpleasant truth.

31:23.110 --> 31:24.319
What is that?

31:25.444 --> 31:26.819
Nothing lasts.

31:28.361 --> 31:29.444
Hey!

31:35.819 --> 31:38.277
Your sister doesn't like me.

31:42.819 --> 31:44.069
She doesn't know you.

31:45.985 --> 31:47.444
If it makes you feel
any better,

31:47.527 --> 31:49.337
she didn't like me either
when we were growing up.

31:49.361 --> 31:51.486
She doesn't need
to be my friend...

31:53.069 --> 31:54.985
but I am her queen.

31:58.486 --> 32:00.444
If she can't respect me...

32:19.319 --> 32:20.569
What's the matter?

32:20.653 --> 32:23.152
The dragons are barely eating.

32:40.527 --> 32:41.819
What's wrong with them?

32:41.903 --> 32:43.486
They don't like the North.

32:59.736 --> 33:00.861
Go on.

33:06.861 --> 33:09.319
I don't know
how to ride a dragon.

33:09.402 --> 33:11.903
Nobody does.
Until they ride a dragon.

33:14.402 --> 33:15.903
What if he doesn't want me to?

33:15.985 --> 33:18.903
Then I've enjoyed your company,
Jon Snow.

33:38.402 --> 33:40.027
What do I hold onto?

33:41.486 --> 33:42.861
Whatever you can.

34:59.778 --> 35:00.778
Aah!

35:39.319 --> 35:41.653
You've completely
ruined horses for me.

35:50.736 --> 35:52.861
We could stay
a thousand years...

35:55.027 --> 35:56.361
no one would find us.

35:58.903 --> 36:00.235
We'd be pretty old.

36:08.402 --> 36:11.444
It's cold up here
for a southern girl.

36:11.527 --> 36:13.235
So keep your queen warm.

36:27.944 --> 36:29.069
Don't be afraid.

36:42.611 --> 36:43.778
That's good.

36:52.736 --> 36:54.486
- Gendry?
- He's here.

37:00.611 --> 37:03.486
It isn't easy making a blade
that big with dragonglass.

37:05.653 --> 37:07.944
You're saying you're good,
is that it?

37:08.027 --> 37:10.027
I'm just saying
it's a tricky material to...

37:10.110 --> 37:13.152
You know who makes weapons
for the wildlings?

37:13.235 --> 37:15.611
Cripples and cocksuckers.

37:15.694 --> 37:18.277
- Which one are you?
- Leave him be.

37:25.486 --> 37:27.069
I heard you were here.

37:29.653 --> 37:31.110
You left me to die.

37:32.152 --> 37:33.819
First I robbed you.

37:45.277 --> 37:47.611
You're a cold little bitch,
aren't you?

37:51.152 --> 37:53.361
Guess that's why
you're still alive.

38:01.069 --> 38:03.653
That was a nice ax
you made for him.

38:03.736 --> 38:04.944
You've gotten better.

38:05.027 --> 38:07.486
Yeah, thanks. So have you.

38:08.694 --> 38:11.027
I mean, you look good.

38:12.527 --> 38:14.527
Thanks. So do you.

38:18.194 --> 38:21.027
It's not a bad place to grow up,
if it wasn't so cold.

38:22.361 --> 38:24.069
Stay close to that forge,
then.

38:24.152 --> 38:27.778
- Is that a command, Lady Stark?
- Don't call me that.

38:27.861 --> 38:30.027
As you wish, milady.

38:37.319 --> 38:38.527
Here's my wish.

38:40.861 --> 38:41.985
Can you make it?

38:42.069 --> 38:44.235
What do you need
something like this for?

38:44.319 --> 38:45.569
Can you make it or not?

38:45.653 --> 38:48.527
You already have a sword.
What's that?

38:55.152 --> 38:56.486
It's Valyrian steel.

38:56.569 --> 38:58.944
I always knew
you were just another rich girl.

39:00.903 --> 39:03.444
You don't know
any other rich girls.

39:13.944 --> 39:14.944
Come in.

39:22.486 --> 39:24.235
Lord Glover wishes us
good fortune,

39:24.319 --> 39:27.653
but he's staying
in Deepwood Motte with his men.

39:30.235 --> 39:32.486
"House Glover will stand
behind House Stark

39:32.569 --> 39:34.944
as we have
for a thousand years."

39:36.110 --> 39:37.402
Isn't that what he said?

39:37.486 --> 39:40.402
"I will stand
behind Jon Snow," he said.

39:41.944 --> 39:43.277
"The King in the North."

39:44.402 --> 39:46.152
I told you we needed allies.

39:46.235 --> 39:49.486
You didn't tell me you
were going to abandon your crown.

39:49.569 --> 39:51.694
I never wanted a crown.

39:51.778 --> 39:54.527
All I wanted
was to protect the North.

39:54.611 --> 39:57.361
I brought two armies
home with me, two dragons.

39:57.444 --> 39:59.110
And a Targaryen queen.

39:59.194 --> 40:00.569
Do you think

40:00.653 --> 40:02.861
we can beat the Army of the Dead
without her?

40:02.944 --> 40:05.903
I fought them, Sansa. Twice.

40:05.985 --> 40:08.194
You want to worry about
who holds what title,

40:08.277 --> 40:10.736
I'm telling you
it doesn't matter.

40:10.819 --> 40:13.486
Without her,
we don't stand a chance.

40:22.402 --> 40:24.985
Do you have
any faith in me at all?

40:26.569 --> 40:27.861
You know I do.

40:32.319 --> 40:33.944
She'll be a good queen.

40:35.027 --> 40:36.110
For all of us.

40:37.778 --> 40:39.277
She's not her father.

40:45.819 --> 40:47.486
No, she's much prettier.

40:52.985 --> 40:55.444
Did you bend the knee
to save the North

40:55.527 --> 40:57.027
or because you love her?

41:21.027 --> 41:22.319
Oh!

41:25.736 --> 41:26.985
So you're the man?

41:27.069 --> 41:28.527
Um...

41:28.611 --> 41:30.653
Which man am I, Your Grace?

41:30.736 --> 41:33.985
The one who saved Ser Jorah
when no one else could.

41:34.069 --> 41:36.235
They could, they just wouldn't.

41:37.569 --> 41:39.486
I'll have to make some changes

41:39.569 --> 41:41.319
in the Citadel
when I take my throne.

41:41.402 --> 41:43.985
A great service
merits a great reward.

41:44.069 --> 41:46.736
Oh, it's my honor
to serve you, Your Grace.

41:46.819 --> 41:49.861
Well, there must be
something I could give you.

41:51.235 --> 41:53.985
If it's not too much trouble,

41:54.069 --> 41:56.486
I could use a pardon.

41:56.569 --> 41:57.819
For what crime?

41:57.903 --> 41:59.069
Um...

41:59.152 --> 42:01.903
I borrowed a few books
from the Citadel.

42:04.277 --> 42:06.319
And also a sword.

42:06.402 --> 42:08.861
- From the Citadel?
- From my family.

42:10.402 --> 42:12.277
It's been in House Tarly
for generations.

42:12.361 --> 42:15.444
It would've been mine
anyway, eventually,

42:15.527 --> 42:18.486
but my father had other ideas.

42:20.861 --> 42:22.235
Not Randyll Tarly?

42:24.194 --> 42:25.611
You know him?

42:29.486 --> 42:32.194
I offered to let him
retain his lands and titles

42:32.277 --> 42:33.361
if he bent the knee.

42:36.444 --> 42:37.569
He refused.

42:47.277 --> 42:48.611
Well...

42:50.778 --> 42:52.694
At least I'll be
allowed home again,

42:52.778 --> 42:54.444
now that my brother's the lord.

42:58.486 --> 43:00.944
Your brother
stood with your father.

43:15.361 --> 43:16.486
Hm.

43:17.985 --> 43:19.903
Thank you, Your Grace.

43:19.985 --> 43:21.402
For telling me.

43:21.486 --> 43:23.235
And m...

43:23.319 --> 43:25.861
- May I...?
- Of course.

44:08.653 --> 44:10.527
What are you doing out here?

44:11.736 --> 44:14.027
Waiting, for an old friend.

44:15.361 --> 44:17.444
It's time
to tell Jon the truth.

44:18.486 --> 44:20.486
No, no.

44:20.569 --> 44:24.444
You're his brother.
Shouldn't you tell him?

44:24.527 --> 44:26.653
I'm not his brother.

44:26.736 --> 44:29.027
He trusts you
more than anyone.

44:30.069 --> 44:32.069
Now's the time.

45:07.152 --> 45:08.611
Sam?

45:08.694 --> 45:12.486
I'm sorry, I know I'm not
supposed to be down here.

45:15.736 --> 45:18.110
- Were you hiding from me?
- Of course not.

45:19.277 --> 45:21.361
What are you doing
in Winterfell?

45:21.444 --> 45:24.110
Or did you read every book
in the Citadel already?

45:27.611 --> 45:29.319
What's wrong?

45:29.402 --> 45:30.861
Gilly? Is she all right?

45:30.944 --> 45:32.778
- She's good.
- Little Sam?

45:34.903 --> 45:35.903
Don't you know?

45:37.277 --> 45:38.402
Know what?

45:39.819 --> 45:40.819
Daenerys...

45:41.985 --> 45:45.152
she executed my father
and brother.

45:45.235 --> 45:46.819
They were her prisoners.

45:50.778 --> 45:52.819
She didn't tell you.

46:01.194 --> 46:02.486
I'm so sorry.

46:05.985 --> 46:07.694
We need to end this war.

46:09.444 --> 46:11.027
Would you have done it?

46:13.110 --> 46:15.069
Well, I've executed men
who disobeyed me.

46:15.152 --> 46:16.861
You've also spared men.

46:16.944 --> 46:19.527
Thousands of wildlings
when they refused to kneel.

46:19.611 --> 46:21.069
I wasn't a king.

46:23.444 --> 46:24.486
But you were.

46:26.194 --> 46:27.527
You've always been.

46:29.486 --> 46:31.194
I gave up my crown, Sam.

46:31.985 --> 46:32.985
I bent the knee.

46:33.069 --> 46:34.611
I'm not
King in the North anymore.

46:34.694 --> 46:36.337
I'm not talking about
the King in the North.

46:36.361 --> 46:39.611
I'm talking about the King
of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.

46:47.194 --> 46:48.903
Bran and I worked it out.

46:48.985 --> 46:51.819
I had a High Septon's diary.
Bran had...

46:52.944 --> 46:54.277
whatever Bran has.

46:54.361 --> 46:56.319
What are you talking about?

46:59.444 --> 47:00.486
Your mother...

47:01.653 --> 47:02.985
was Lyanna Stark.

47:04.569 --> 47:05.903
And your father...

47:07.194 --> 47:09.152
your real father

47:09.235 --> 47:10.903
was Rhaegar Targaryen.

47:13.069 --> 47:15.694
You've never been a bastard.

47:15.778 --> 47:19.527
You're Aegon Targaryen,
true heir to the Iron Throne.

47:23.778 --> 47:26.569
I'm sorry,
I know it's a lot to take in.

47:35.778 --> 47:39.110
My father was the most
honorable man I ever met.

47:42.653 --> 47:44.736
You're saying
he lied to me all my life.

47:44.819 --> 47:45.944
No.

47:46.944 --> 47:50.444
Your father... Well, Ned Stark.

47:50.527 --> 47:53.903
He promised your mother
he'd always protect you.

47:53.985 --> 47:56.778
And he did. Robert would have
murdered you if he knew.

47:58.778 --> 48:00.277
You're the true king.

48:01.444 --> 48:03.319
Aegon Targaryen,
Sixth of His Name,

48:03.402 --> 48:05.402
Protector of the Realm,
all of it.

48:19.944 --> 48:22.903
- Daenerys is our queen.
- She shouldn't be.

48:24.819 --> 48:26.819
- That's treason.
- It's the truth.

48:28.569 --> 48:31.152
You gave up your crown
to save your people.

48:32.819 --> 48:34.486
Would she do the same?

50:42.694 --> 50:44.361
Stay back, he's got blue eyes!

50:44.444 --> 50:46.069
I've always had blue eyes!

50:56.110 --> 50:57.277
Did you find anyone?

51:30.653 --> 51:32.819
The Umber boy.

51:32.903 --> 51:34.027
It's a message.

51:35.152 --> 51:36.736
From the Night King.

51:36.819 --> 51:40.486
His army's between us
and Winterfell. We're on foot.

51:40.569 --> 51:42.402
We rode down from
Castle Black.

51:42.486 --> 51:44.736
We can double up
on the horses.

51:44.819 --> 51:48.736
If the horses last,
we'll get there before the dead.

51:48.819 --> 51:49.944
We just have to hope

51:50.027 --> 51:51.736
the Night King
doesn't come first.

52:43.402 --> 52:45.944
Keep moving! Straight up!

52:47.819 --> 52:50.736
Stay together!
Don't fall behind!

55:05.861 --> 55:07.754
When I was a child,
my brother would tell me

55:07.778 --> 55:11.235
a bedtime story, about the man
who murdered our father.

55:12.569 --> 55:15.027
About all the things we would
do to that man.

55:17.694 --> 55:19.277
You never should have
trusted Cersei.

55:19.361 --> 55:20.861
You never should have either.

55:22.152 --> 55:23.319
Death...

55:23.903 --> 55:27.277
it's got many faces, I look
forward to seeing this one.

55:28.653 --> 55:29.736
How long do we have?

55:34.569 --> 55:36.569
Before the sun
comes up tomorrow.

55:37.305 --> 55:43.290
