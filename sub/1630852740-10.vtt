02:04.524 --> 02:06.426
I did 33,000 grafts.

07:11.331 --> 07:12.710
The stakes here

07:12.734 --> 07:14.134
are really high because

07:14.167 --> 07:15.813
this is in

07:15.837 --> 07:17.504

07:17.537 --> 07:19.316

07:19.340 --> 07:21.141

- the proper term here...

-to remove this.

07:24.441 --> 07:25.426
-Yeah.

07:25.450 --> 07:27.010
What makes Jazmyn's birthmark

07:27.034 --> 07:28.615
very difficult is that

07:28.648 --> 07:30.860
- it's extending into different
- parts of her neck where

07:30.884 --> 07:32.162
there's a lot

07:32.186 --> 07:33.486
of nerves, blood vessels.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.680
- So if you remove it in
- the wrong way, you can cause

07:35.722 --> 07:37.567
- what we call
- a "scar contracture,"

07:37.624 --> 07:38.619
and her neck could

07:38.643 --> 07:39.659
become really tight,

07:39.693 --> 07:40.771
and she could

07:40.795 --> 07:41.895

08:16.290 --> 08:18.108

- a nevus sebaceous,

- and pretty much it's a big,
- large birthmark,

22:11.149 --> 22:12.432

22:19.839 --> 22:21.975
That's why everyone said no.

22:22.750 --> 22:24.506

- a reason why calf implants

22:24.530 --> 22:25.912
are not a popular procedure

22:25.945 --> 22:27.758
- and very few
- plastic surgeons do them

22:27.814 --> 22:29.804
because they can move,

22:29.828 --> 22:31.556

22:58.046 --> 22:59.446

Then, we'll be able to close

23:01.470 --> 23:02.637

23:02.661 --> 23:03.850
finally be implant-free.

debate plastic surgery.

29:59.990 --> 30:01.878
- You debated
- a very unusual portion.

30:01.935 --> 30:03.403
Yes, absolutely.

30:03.436 --> 30:05.138
I was never on the debate team.

30:05.171 --> 30:06.466
But if I were,

30:06.490 --> 30:07.807
I can tell you one thing.

30:07.841 --> 30:09.370
I would have

30:09.394 --> 30:10.944
been a master debater.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.779
[chuckling]

30:12.812 --> 30:14.091
So, take us back to,

30:14.115 --> 30:15.415
sort of, your body journey.

30:15.715 --> 30:18.161
- I was 15
- the first time I had Botox.

30:18.218 --> 30:19.530
-You had Botox at age 15?

30:19.554 --> 30:20.887
-At 15.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.833
- Did you show them
- fake I.D. or something?

30:22.889 --> 30:24.768
- No, they didn't
- even ask for an I.D.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.189
And they never said,

30:26.213 --> 30:27.600
"Hey, how old are you?"

30:27.930 --> 30:29.429
No. It was an eye doctor.

30:29.462 --> 30:31.441
- I let an eye doctor
- inject me with Botox.

30:31.498 --> 30:33.877
I may or may not

30:33.901 --> 30:36.302
have maybe bought a Groupon

30:36.336 --> 30:38.448
- Did you get fillers as well,
- or just Botox then?

30:38.505 --> 30:41.184
- -I had a filler a month later.
- -You did?

30:41.241 --> 30:43.201
- Mh-hm. That's where
- I really stemmed off from.

30:43.243 --> 30:45.086
- What was the first
- body implant thing you did?

30:45.110 --> 30:46.513
Pec implants.

30:46.780 --> 30:48.357
- Did they put it
- through the nipple? The areola?

30:48.381 --> 30:50.193
- No, no,
- they went under the armpit.

30:50.250 --> 30:52.095
- Okay, and are
- you happy with those?

30:52.152 --> 30:54.431
- I love them. I'm gonna
- go a little bigger. Of course.

30:54.487 --> 30:56.487
- You know, your body
- gets bigger. You get older.

30:56.756 --> 30:58.252
Right. Right, and then

30:58.276 --> 30:59.793
bicep implants. Same doctor.

30:59.826 --> 31:01.021
This arm healed

31:01.045 --> 31:02.262
wonderful. It was great.

31:02.295 --> 31:04.617
- This arm, on the other hand,
- it doesn't feel

31:04.970 --> 31:06.375
- as well incorporated
- as this one does.

31:06.399 --> 31:09.112
- -I can almost flip it halfway.
- -Wow.

31:09.169 --> 31:11.515
- So what would you want
- Dr. Dubrow to do to your arm?

31:11.838 --> 31:13.100
I would want for you to

31:13.124 --> 31:14.407
put it where it should be.

31:14.441 --> 31:16.242
But once that's perfect,

31:16.276 --> 31:17.921
- I'm gonna do
- a three piece shoulder.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.497
- So once I do
- that and add a tricep,

31:19.546 --> 31:21.325
- maybe we'll look
- a little bit better.

31:21.381 --> 31:23.427
- So, wow, you're
- going to go the whole upper

31:23.483 --> 31:25.149
-and lower body implant thing?

31:25.173 --> 31:26.467
-Absolutely.

31:26.491 --> 31:28.880
What do you think about that?

31:30.900 --> 31:32.897
- Rather than go to the gym,
- do that.

31:32.923 --> 31:33.993
Yeaah!

31:34.940 --> 31:35.906
- Yes, just remember, you
- have to leave with me today.

31:35.962 --> 31:37.724
Yes, you can go to

31:37.748 --> 31:39.532
the gym! Drink some Ensure!

31:39.866 --> 31:41.935
Hah, drink some Ensure!

- like the whole fact,

seeing that your arm right now,

31:46.941 --> 31:48.441
this damn thing is mobile

31:48.475 --> 31:49.853
is dangerous to my mind.

31:49.877 --> 31:51.277
You need to go see it.

31:51.311 --> 31:53.456
- So let's take a look and see
- what's going on. All right?

31:53.480 --> 31:55.091
Yes, let's do it.

31:55.115 --> 31:56.549
So, let me take...

Do you mind? Okay. So

32:24.378 --> 32:26.179
you're happy with these, yeah?

32:26.212 --> 32:28.558
- Because normally
- the implant should go below

32:28.615 --> 32:30.917
the areola and it's...

32:30.950 --> 32:32.461
Sitting at the areola.

32:35.989 --> 32:37.390
This is the good one.

- So you have
- the incisions made there,

32:39.192 --> 32:40.860

Yeah, it's looks crazy to me.

Listen, like

33:02.267 --> 33:04.184
you're twisting something,

like doing cartwheels,

inside of your arm like that,

just you don't play with that.

- You don't mess with that.

Don't change it. Like,

33:13.561 --> 33:15.562
that's just too much.

- -Hello.
- -Oof. That bugs you out, huh?

33:18.598 --> 33:20.043
-Yeah. Not a fan of that.

33:20.067 --> 33:21.534
-Your face got all white.

- Yeah, I'm. I'm sorry,

after you're not pissed,

I feel fine.

34:57.548 --> 34:58.598
I just noticed

34:58.631 --> 35:00.476
- that it's still just
- a little tender around here,

35:00.500 --> 35:02.679
- but not as bad as it
- was when I had the expander.

35:02.736 --> 35:03.914
-So let's do this.

35:03.938 --> 35:05.138
-Let's rock and roll.

35:05.171 --> 35:07.140
Our goal today is to remove it

35:07.173 --> 35:08.785
as much of the nevus

35:08.809 --> 35:10.443
sebaceous as possible

35:10.477 --> 35:11.772
and try not to place

35:11.796 --> 35:13.113
another tissue expander.

35:13.146 --> 35:15.091
Once I examine the tissue,

35:15.115 --> 35:17.117
I might say I'm not touching it

35:17.150 --> 35:19.128
- and we'll put a tissue
- expander inside of her neck,

35:19.152 --> 35:21.598
- but we're not going to know
- 'til we get inside surgery.

35:21.654 --> 35:23.183
Okay, so this is

35:23.207 --> 35:24.758
going to be tricky.

35:25.580 --> 35:26.635
- That's why before
- we make an incision,

35:26.659 --> 35:28.638
- I want to just see
- if I can balloon it up

35:28.695 --> 35:30.457
a little bit more.

35:30.481 --> 35:32.265

- the surgery for us here

- and in that fluid
- underneath the skin,

35:39.272 --> 35:41.485
- it's just lifting
- out the skin. There we go.

35:41.541 --> 35:43.209
And just did it for us.

35:43.243 --> 35:45.088

- movement at all or no?

- so removing any tissue at all

that had a hint of the nevus.

- would be a discoloration.
