00:47.980 --> 00:52.935
You know, after last year's corporate,
my wife was always encouraging me.

00:52.940 --> 00:56.259
You know, she said: you did fine,
you did fine in the corporate.

00:56.260 --> 00:59.339
I was a bit nervous. This
little guy... hello. Sorry.

00:59.340 --> 01:02.819
That's nice, eh? Nice background
with the people there...

01:02.820 --> 01:06.259
We are here at the... must I look..?
- Just look straight at the lens.

01:06.260 --> 01:09.179
We are here at the... MNU head office,

01:09.180 --> 01:12.459
Department of Alien Affairs.
My name is Wikus Van De Merwe.

01:12.460 --> 01:15.899
And behind me you can see
the Alien Affairs' workers.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.939
And what we do here at
this department is...

01:18.940 --> 01:21.739
we try to engage with the Prawn

01:21.740 --> 01:26.230
on behalf of MNU and
on behalf of humans.

01:27.700 --> 01:31.299
To everyone's surprise, the
ship didn't come to a stop

01:31.300 --> 01:34.259
over Manhattan or Washington or Chicago,

01:34.260 --> 01:40.260
but instead it costed to a halt
directly over the city of Johannesburg.

01:41.220 --> 01:45.299
The doors didn't open for 3 months. It
just hovered there. Nobody could get in.

01:45.300 --> 01:47.939
And they eventually decided,
after much deliberation,

01:47.940 --> 01:53.940
that the best thing to do would
be to physically cut their way in.

01:58.500 --> 02:02.560
We were on the verge of first contact.

02:03.500 --> 02:06.299
The whole world was watching.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.699
Expecting, I don't know...

02:08.699 --> 02:13.660
...music from heaven and
bright shining lights.

02:16.380 --> 02:18.460
Oh my God!

02:26.260 --> 02:29.419
The creatures were
extremely malnourished,

02:29.420 --> 02:32.939
they were very unhealthy,
they seemed to be aimless.

02:32.940 --> 02:35.979
There was a lot of international
pressure on us at the time.

02:35.980 --> 02:38.459
The entire world was
looking at Johannesburg,

02:38.460 --> 02:40.699
so we had to do the right thing.

02:40.700 --> 02:43.739
The government then established
an aid group that started to

02:43.740 --> 02:48.619
ferry the aliens to a temporary
camp set up just beneath the ship.

02:48.620 --> 02:53.019
We didn't have a plan.
There was a million of them.

02:53.020 --> 02:57.179
So, what was a temporary
holding zone soon became fenced,

02:57.180 --> 03:01.579
became militarized. And before
we knew it, it was a slum.

03:01.580 --> 03:04.859
But the truth is, nobody
really knew what this place was.

03:04.860 --> 03:09.065
There's a lot of secrets in District 9.

03:16.940 --> 03:20.139
At first, a lot of
attention was given to...

03:20.140 --> 03:23.779
giving the aliens a proper
status and protection.

03:23.780 --> 03:26.579
They're spending so much
money to keep them here.

03:26.580 --> 03:29.699
When they could be spending
it on other things, but...

03:29.700 --> 03:35.045
...at least they're keeping
them separate from us.

03:37.100 --> 03:41.859
l want to be realistic with everyone.
The aliens will not be able to go home.

03:41.860 --> 03:44.870
The aliens are here to stay.

03:44.940 --> 03:47.179
There were literally
thousands of different theories

03:47.180 --> 03:51.219
as to why the ship seemed inoperable,
and what was speculated was that

03:51.220 --> 03:54.219
the command module had detached
itself from the main ship,

03:54.220 --> 03:56.819
and then somehow
mysteriously became lost.

03:56.820 --> 04:02.099
Did it fall by itself or was
it programmed? I don't know.

04:02.100 --> 04:05.059
Examination of the old video footage

04:05.060 --> 04:10.645
shows very clearly that a
piece falls from the ship.

04:11.980 --> 04:14.419
We look for it. We look everywhere.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.099
This piece that's falling
caused us bloody problems.

04:17.100 --> 04:19.459
More energy weapon caches found.

04:19.459 --> 04:22.219
The Special task force
conducted raids in District 9.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.619
Where there's a weapon, there's
crime. Tensions rose, and rose.

04:25.620 --> 04:29.379
People became more and more fed up,
and eventually the rioting started.

04:29.380 --> 04:32.939
Residents in Tembisa rioted
for the third consecutive night

04:32.940 --> 04:38.940
in an attempt to remove all
the aliens from their township.

04:41.860 --> 04:44.819
I think they must fix
that ship and they must go.

04:44.820 --> 04:48.899
A virus, a selective virus.
Release it near the aliens.

04:48.900 --> 04:51.779
They must just go. I
don't know where, just go.

04:51.780 --> 04:54.179
If they was from another
country we might understand.

04:54.180 --> 04:56.219
But they are not even from this planet.

04:56.220 --> 04:58.819
The government have
enforced a nationwide curfew.

04:58.820 --> 05:02.059
The aliens, prawns,
they take my wife away.

05:02.060 --> 05:05.619
The derogatory term Prawn is used for
the alien, and obviously it implies

05:05.620 --> 05:09.699
something that is a bottom feeder,
that scavenges the leftovers.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.939
I mean, you can't say
they don't look like that.

05:11.940 --> 05:14.219
That's what they look like,
right? They look like prawns.

05:14.220 --> 05:18.779
The aliens made off with an undisclosed
amount of cash. One bystander was hurt.

05:18.780 --> 05:22.059
What for an alien might be
seen as something recreational,

05:22.060 --> 05:25.179
setting fire to a
truck, derailing a train,

05:25.180 --> 05:29.659
is for us obviously an
extremely destructive act.

05:29.660 --> 05:33.019
They can take the sneakers
you are wearing off you.

05:33.020 --> 05:36.459
They take whatever you have on
you. Your cell phone or anything.

05:36.460 --> 05:39.180
After that they kill you.

05:39.500 --> 05:42.979
And now, after 20 years, public
pressure had forced the government

05:42.980 --> 05:46.059
to shift the aliens out of Johannesburg.

05:46.060 --> 05:49.659
They had had enough and they
wanted District 9 to be moved,

05:49.660 --> 05:52.059
and more intensively
policed and controlled.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.779
So, to enforce this mass eviction,
the government turned to MNU.

05:55.780 --> 05:58.139
Welcome all and thank you for coming.

05:58.140 --> 06:01.099
Please listen very
closely to this briefing.

06:01.100 --> 06:06.339
Today we start a very complex
and delicate operation.

06:06.340 --> 06:10.419
This is the largest operation
that MNU has ever undertaken,

06:10.420 --> 06:14.619
and we believe that it is going
to be undertaken successfully.

06:14.620 --> 06:17.979
It is to move 1.8 million prawns

06:17.980 --> 06:22.579
from their present home in District
9 to a safer and better location

06:22.580 --> 06:26.499
200 kilometers outside
of Johannesburg City.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.299
We built a nice new facility
where the prawn can go,

06:29.300 --> 06:32.219
he can be comfortable,
he can stay there...

06:32.220 --> 06:36.019
The people of Johannesburg and
of South Africa are going to live

06:36.020 --> 06:40.539
happily and safely, knowing
that that prawn is very far away.

06:40.540 --> 06:44.459
UIO protocol dictates
that we give the aliens

06:44.460 --> 06:48.179
24 hours notice of our right to evict.

06:48.180 --> 06:53.659
Today, you will serve these notices
getting the aliens to sign I-27 form.

06:53.660 --> 06:58.419
The legality that MNU is using to
evict the aliens is simply a whitewash.

06:58.420 --> 07:03.619
I'm going to appoint a field
officer to take direct command.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.665
Wikus Van De Merwe.

07:05.700 --> 07:09.219
Everybody always said that
Wikus was not a very smart boy,

07:09.220 --> 07:15.045
but he was a wonderful son.
That was my Wikus, just...

07:15.780 --> 07:19.819
Feels like life on the big
stage. Thank you Piet... Mr Smith.

07:19.820 --> 07:24.379
l had to put aside the fact that
my daughter was married to Wikus.

07:24.380 --> 07:28.339
That didn't affect my
decision to promote him.

07:28.340 --> 07:33.219
It's almost as big as my wedding
day. You know... not as big.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.579
Wikus was always making me things.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.539
He said that way they
just mean so much more.

07:38.540 --> 07:41.579
He left this paper-mache
bowl on the sofa one day

07:41.580 --> 07:46.099
and I didn't see it and I sat
down, and I... kinda squashed it.

07:46.100 --> 07:49.899
They took all his stuff away
for the investigation, and...

07:49.900 --> 07:52.459
I made them bring it all back.

07:52.460 --> 07:55.059
Hey, congratulations,
man! -Thanks, man.

07:55.060 --> 07:58.499
Okay, you're gonna go to P7.
- Wikus! -How is it going, man?

07:58.500 --> 08:01.179
Here's the shake. P9 for you. -Thanks.

08:01.180 --> 08:03.939
I'm not saying what he
did was right, but...

08:03.940 --> 08:06.819
he took the choices
that were given to him.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.779
This is Trent. Fundiswa, Trent. -Hi.

08:09.780 --> 08:12.659
Fundiswa is the guy that
I've selected to replace me.

08:12.660 --> 08:15.659
If he can make it
today, eh? -I'll make it.

08:15.660 --> 08:18.739
I just want everyone
watching this right now

08:18.740 --> 08:22.299
to learn from what has
happened. -You would think...

08:22.300 --> 08:27.539
things like this would happen
to somebody else, not to me.

08:27.540 --> 08:31.259
How is it going, man? Long time,
mate. Have you got my stuff?

08:31.260 --> 08:33.859
Hey, boss! -How is it
going? -I'm all right, boss.

08:33.860 --> 08:36.539
Good, good, this is Fundiswa.
He is training with us today.

08:36.539 --> 08:39.339
I think I was disgusted
with the way he worked.

08:39.340 --> 08:42.299
There was always just a hint
of something not quite kosher

08:42.299 --> 08:45.099
with mr Van De Merwe.
- Nobody saw it coming at all.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.899
None of us had any idea
of what he was doing.

08:47.900 --> 08:50.339
l think it is a great
thing to see that...

08:50.340 --> 08:52.539
it's not the military
guys in charge this time.

08:52.540 --> 08:54.779
Not to say that Koobus and
his cowboys are not wanted.

08:54.780 --> 08:56.979
You guys are always wanted.

08:56.980 --> 09:00.705
You see now, these are the cowboys.

09:00.860 --> 09:04.219
They shoot first, and then
they answer the questions.

09:04.220 --> 09:07.259
Sorry, is this above the
allocated amount of ammunition?

09:07.260 --> 09:09.499
Because I see your
pouches are full but...

09:09.500 --> 09:12.819
I think maybe you should
speak to the colonel.

09:12.820 --> 09:16.539
F.A.G. over here says that
we got too much ammunition.

09:16.540 --> 09:19.099
No, all I'm saying,
Koobus, is that, you know...

09:19.100 --> 09:22.099
you should find ways of making
you guys more efficient...

09:22.100 --> 09:24.299
Listen to me, you fuck!

09:24.300 --> 09:26.690
Get him outta my face.

09:27.380 --> 09:30.819
There are rules, we're all
living by rules in this world.

09:30.820 --> 09:34.139
Well, l don't think he can
be forgiven for what he did,

09:34.140 --> 09:37.139
cause it's like a betrayal.
- I've gotta get going, Les.

09:37.140 --> 09:43.140
I think we're gonna have to cut this
interview, cause we're gonna go...

09:51.380 --> 09:54.460
12 KILOMETERS FROM DISTRICT 9

10:03.420 --> 10:07.539
Take your magazines,
people. Come on, lets go.

10:07.540 --> 10:11.739
The Prawn doesn't really understand
the concept of ownership of property.

10:11.740 --> 10:15.259
So, we have to come there and
say: listen, this is our land.

10:15.260 --> 10:17.860
Please, will you go?

10:20.900 --> 10:23.299
It's difficult to put
the vest on by yourself.

10:23.300 --> 10:25.339
Thomas, can you help
me? -All right, boss.

10:25.340 --> 10:27.939
They told me I was gonna get
the vest inside the Casper.

10:27.940 --> 10:30.739
Thomas, just look on the
side if there's a vest there?

10:30.740 --> 10:33.939
I'm just concerned about my family.
- Don't worry about the vest, it'll be fine.

10:33.940 --> 10:37.059
Rights groups have demanded
that mercenaries should comply

10:37.060 --> 10:40.419
with all UYO regulations in District 9.

10:40.420 --> 10:43.619
We're coming to you from
the entrance of District 9

10:43.620 --> 10:47.379
as today, Multi National
United sets out to relocate

10:47.380 --> 10:51.299
approximately 1.8 million alien
residents from their homes.

10:51.300 --> 10:54.219
Human rights groups are
keeping a watchful eye,

10:54.220 --> 10:57.895
as many suspect abuses might occur.

11:12.980 --> 11:16.219
We're seeing heavily armed
private security forces

11:16.220 --> 11:18.739
being deployed into District 9.

11:18.740 --> 11:22.605
Backed up by significant air support.

11:30.100 --> 11:33.499
We'll go shack to shack and
get them to sign the form.

11:33.500 --> 11:36.180
First one EX 247.

11:36.820 --> 11:42.820
We're seeing the convoy stop.
The operation is about to begin.

11:43.460 --> 11:45.780
Just stay focused.

11:45.860 --> 11:49.725
Are you ready,
Thomas? -Yeah. -Okay.

11:51.420 --> 11:54.379
Is that a signal? Okay, fellows.

11:54.380 --> 11:58.105
You stay behind us. Good luck, boy.

12:04.940 --> 12:09.099
Stay low! Where is he going? What is it?

12:09.100 --> 12:11.499
It's clear that security is very high.

12:11.500 --> 12:16.800
This is only the beginning
of a total clamp down.

12:25.180 --> 12:30.670
This is MNU agents. Open
the door please! -Open up!

12:31.940 --> 12:34.260
Hello! Hello, hello...

12:34.940 --> 12:37.899
This is Wikus Van De Merwe from MNU.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.299
We are here to serve
you an eviction notice.

12:40.300 --> 12:43.099
You just put your
scrawl there. -Fuck off!

12:43.100 --> 12:46.419
All right! Thomas, hold it!
We've got his scrawl there.

12:46.420 --> 12:51.019
Because as he hit it,
it counts as a scrawl.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.619
First time we come in, there
will always be a little bit

12:53.620 --> 12:56.219
of tension happening
between us and them.

12:56.220 --> 12:58.819
Hey, you can't eat that, man!

12:58.820 --> 13:01.899
The prawn likes to eat the rubber.
To him it's like a marshmallow.

13:01.900 --> 13:06.675
No, no! Guard! Don't
confront him like that!

13:08.020 --> 13:13.225
Did you see that? Right
in the roost. Stay calm!

13:13.900 --> 13:16.859
This is gonna be a problem cause
now all prawns are coming out,

13:16.860 --> 13:19.619
they wanna see what's
going on. Stop it! Stop it!

13:19.620 --> 13:22.299
Bring my kit. See,
everybody is gathering now.

13:22.300 --> 13:25.139
Don't shoot or you're gonna
turn it into a warzone!

13:25.140 --> 13:28.139
What is that? Is that a
tear gas? -No, it's cat food.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.979
It is cat food. I just distract them.

13:31.980 --> 13:37.760
One of them attacked the
prawn and he's lost his arm.

13:38.420 --> 13:42.259
No it's not my house. I don't live here.

13:42.260 --> 13:45.139
Well, that's a pity
because, you know, this...

13:45.140 --> 13:49.179
This is a nice cat food, you know.
But of course, it's not your house.

13:49.180 --> 13:52.139
So, we'll just have to go and give it
to someone else. -Yes! It's my house!

13:52.140 --> 13:55.539
We need you to sign here.
Now you can take that...

13:55.540 --> 13:57.700
All right. Stop it!

13:58.020 --> 14:01.219
The creatures became incredibly
obsessed with cat food.

14:01.220 --> 14:07.220
Something about it, like catnip
for cats. Only a lot more intense.

14:11.820 --> 14:15.139
Hello? MNU. We are here
to serve eviction notices.

14:15.140 --> 14:17.620
What is eviction?

14:18.300 --> 14:21.299
What we have stranded
on Earth in this colony,

14:21.300 --> 14:24.539
is basically the workers that are
unable to think for themselves.

14:24.540 --> 14:27.299
They will take commands,
they have no initiative.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.699
They've lost all the apt of leadership

14:29.700 --> 14:34.230
through whatever cause.
We presume illness.

14:35.180 --> 14:40.190
I'm holding steady over
Nigerian compound area.

14:48.620 --> 14:52.379
Where there's a slum, there's crime.
And District 9 was no exception.

14:52.380 --> 14:57.499
The nigerians had various scams going.
One of them was the cat food scam.

14:57.500 --> 15:01.459
Where they sold cat food to the
aliens for exorbitant prices.

15:01.460 --> 15:07.419
You put the money here first. You
don't get anything until you pay.

15:07.420 --> 15:10.859
What are you trying to do?
I'll chop your balls off.

15:10.860 --> 15:13.579
Not to mention
interspecies prostitution,

15:13.580 --> 15:16.259
and they also dealt in alien weaponry.

15:16.260 --> 15:18.739
You have a car hijacking,
there's a chop shop there,

15:18.740 --> 15:20.979
you can see that, that's
somebody's car in there.

15:20.980 --> 15:25.379
The nigerians in District 9 are
headed by a man called Obesandjo.

15:25.380 --> 15:28.619
He's a very powerful underground
figure in Johannesburg.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.659
You don't want to play with these boys.

15:30.660 --> 15:33.860
They will cut you into pieces.

15:34.380 --> 15:37.659
That's the boss there. OK, no problem.

15:37.660 --> 15:42.865
Don't look at him! This
is gonna cause problems.

15:45.100 --> 15:48.490
All right, next. 766, all right.

15:48.660 --> 15:51.619
MNU agents. Open the door please!

15:51.620 --> 15:54.420
Whoa! Jesus! What is it?

15:55.220 --> 15:58.180
Check the other side!

15:58.900 --> 16:01.539
Control, this is Wikus Van De Merwe.

16:01.540 --> 16:05.539
I need a population control team
at JV 766 immediately, please.

16:05.540 --> 16:09.139
Check the other side, Thomas!
There is 40 to 50 eggs in here.

16:09.140 --> 16:12.339
Is this normal? -This
is an amazing find.

16:12.340 --> 16:14.539
l can just show you a
little bit how it works.

16:14.540 --> 16:17.579
Basically, a cow is hung from
the ceiling, you can see here.

16:17.580 --> 16:20.579
Very little of it left, of
course, because all these pipes

16:20.580 --> 16:23.779
supply the nutrition to
the little prawn eggs.

16:23.780 --> 16:27.339
You can do one, I can show
you, want to see? -No, I'm fine.

16:27.340 --> 16:29.939
There we go. Okay, no
more nutrition to the guy.

16:29.940 --> 16:32.739
Then finally we take air back.

16:32.740 --> 16:35.939
The little guy is gone to
a nice little sleep now.

16:35.940 --> 16:39.259
You pop him out, there
we go. Pop him out here.

16:39.260 --> 16:43.179
You can take that. You wanna keep it
as a souvenir of your first abortion.

16:43.180 --> 16:47.939
You can feel like you did one
of these here. -Thanks, boss.

16:47.940 --> 16:52.139
Okay, here it comes,
guys. This is the snake.

16:52.140 --> 16:54.739
If we were going to abort
each egg one at the time,

16:54.740 --> 16:58.419
it'd take a very long time.
So, this makes a lot of sense.

16:58.420 --> 17:01.819
You hear that? That's a popping
sound that you're hearing.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.899
It's almost like a popcorn.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.499
What the egg does, it pops up.

17:06.500 --> 17:09.499
The little guy, what's
left of him, pops out there.

17:09.500 --> 17:12.618
So that's the sound that
you're hearing with the popping.

17:12.619 --> 17:16.378
You don't need that, man.
Only sissies wear that.

17:16.380 --> 17:19.858
Been drinking a little bit here, eh?

17:19.859 --> 17:24.179
What are you doing with this
television set, sir? What's this?

17:24.180 --> 17:26.419
Hey, smile for the cameras here.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.859
That's a first day
find. -That's a big find.

17:28.860 --> 17:32.739
You see this? Trent, look at this!
There's weapons all over here.

17:32.740 --> 17:35.060
CK 5, 7572...

17:35.420 --> 17:38.300
Some of the guns are small

17:38.420 --> 17:42.770
but if it shoot you, it make a big mess.

17:45.980 --> 17:49.899
MNU is trying to move the
aliens for humanitarian reasons.

17:49.900 --> 17:52.099
But the real focus, just as it has been

17:52.100 --> 17:54.899
right from the beginning, is weapons.

17:54.900 --> 17:58.819
MNU is the second largest
weapons manufacturer in the world.

17:58.820 --> 18:01.819
We assumed that we'd be able
to pick up the alien laser gun

18:01.820 --> 18:04.659
and just be able to shoot,
but it didn't work like that.

18:04.660 --> 18:07.259
Because, as we discovered,
their technology is actually

18:07.260 --> 18:10.819
engineered in a biological manner to
interact exclusively with their DNA.

18:10.820 --> 18:15.219
It just doesn't work with humans.
And it's as simple as that.

18:15.220 --> 18:18.179
This is basically a guy,
and there's 3 humans here.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.939
Basically trying to
make a warning, you know.

18:20.940 --> 18:24.259
He's saying "I kill 3
humans, watch out for me."

18:24.260 --> 18:29.579
Hey, don't urinate on your own
bloody... get back, get back.

18:29.580 --> 18:34.179
This is Wikus, requesting
First Battalion escort, please.

18:34.180 --> 18:37.659
You want to talk to them
or you want to talk to me?

18:37.660 --> 18:40.180
No, not them!

18:46.140 --> 18:52.140
Okay, guys, thanks very much.
Yeah I know, he had a spade.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.900
Look-I find some!

19:08.020 --> 19:12.459
I tell you before... this is
human technology, it is useless.

19:12.460 --> 19:15.659
Only our technology contains the fluid.

19:15.660 --> 19:19.499
This is not our
technology? -No, it's junk.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.420
Keep looking.

19:23.660 --> 19:25.820
I find something.

19:26.460 --> 19:29.740
Yes. This is what we need.

19:29.900 --> 19:32.260
Good, little one.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.540
Get down!

19:47.340 --> 19:49.580
Careful... wait...

19:50.180 --> 19:51.820
...there.

19:52.620 --> 19:55.420
Why must it take so long?

19:55.620 --> 19:58.859
Because it is very difficult...

19:58.860 --> 20:01.620
...so much can go wrong.

20:13.220 --> 20:15.820
Twenty years of work.

20:16.020 --> 20:20.505
Our plan is ready now?
- Quiet... listen...

20:20.780 --> 20:23.580
...they are coming.

20:30.500 --> 20:34.659
You must hide this.
They must not find it.

20:34.660 --> 20:37.739
Answer the door and be polite.

20:37.740 --> 20:40.060
No! You take it.

20:40.980 --> 20:44.179
You see, this is the problem.
This is the gang sign.

20:44.180 --> 20:46.779
You see this? So again,
looks like we have

20:46.780 --> 20:49.179
more and more gang members.

20:49.180 --> 20:51.979
Fundiswa, you just stay
back. You stay behind Thomas.

20:51.980 --> 20:55.339
This place is swarming with
MNU. I will be searched.

20:55.340 --> 21:00.019
I must get back to my son.
Don't make them angry - be polite!

21:00.020 --> 21:02.819
MNU agents, open the door please.

21:02.820 --> 21:06.259
Hello? We would like you
to... -Nobody is here.

21:06.260 --> 21:09.819
Okay, that's unexceptable.
That is totally unexceptable!

21:09.820 --> 21:12.979
Get out! Get out! You stupid prawn!

21:12.980 --> 21:16.560
- Get outside!
- C'mon! Move! Move!

21:25.860 --> 21:28.699
On your knees! -I'm gonna have a look.

21:28.700 --> 21:30.779
Just stay there! Right there!

21:30.780 --> 21:33.659
Sir, we have to serve
you an eviction notice.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.659
Do you understand it? -No.

21:35.660 --> 21:38.859
This is a classic kind of
gangsta shack, I can tell you.

21:38.860 --> 21:42.899
We're gonna find weapons here.
Watch your head, don't hit the cows.

21:42.900 --> 21:45.939
Just checking for
panels. Ah, you hear that?

21:45.940 --> 21:48.520
Yeah, it's hollow there.

21:49.140 --> 21:51.420
See? Look at that!

21:51.740 --> 21:55.459
I haven't see this type of
setup. It's almost like a...

21:55.460 --> 21:58.040
chemistry type of a set.

21:58.460 --> 22:01.140
It's gotta be something.

22:11.420 --> 22:15.099
l don't know, this has got
the markings there of...

22:15.100 --> 22:18.099
...so it is definitely alien.

22:18.100 --> 22:23.025
But it's not a weapon.
But I don't trust it.

22:24.540 --> 22:29.315
Are you all right?
Wikus, are you all right?

22:33.180 --> 22:36.179
Switch it off, please. Just turn it off.

22:36.180 --> 22:39.619
Are you gonna cut that part
out, Trent, where it sprays me?

22:39.620 --> 22:41.859
- Yeah, don't worry.
- You cut that.

22:41.860 --> 22:45.339
We just found a dangerous object here.

22:45.340 --> 22:49.739
It has a fuel in and I suspect it
might leak onto people or cause damage.

22:49.740 --> 22:53.499
So we just check that in and we
take that down nicely to the lab.

22:53.500 --> 22:55.779
It's not a weapon but it's dangerous.

22:55.780 --> 22:59.139
He's got weapons somewhere here,
my sense is telling me that.

22:59.140 --> 23:01.859
Lets check the other side
here. Thomas! -Yes sir?

23:01.860 --> 23:04.259
Thomas, keep the gun on
him. -OK, I got it sir!

23:04.260 --> 23:07.819
Keep the gun on him,
Thomas, there's weapons here!

23:07.820 --> 23:11.219
Oh, this is Christmas! This
is Christmas, my friends.

23:11.220 --> 23:13.779
This is the biggest
find that I've ever seen.

23:13.780 --> 23:16.019
Control, come in. Wikus Van De Merwe,

23:16.020 --> 23:19.690
requesting First Reaction Battalion.

23:23.140 --> 23:25.260
Stand by, guys!

23:25.900 --> 23:28.539
This gun I've never
seen. Have you seen this?

23:28.540 --> 23:31.939
This is amazing! Look at
this gun. What gun is this?

23:31.940 --> 23:33.939
This is absolutely amazing!

23:33.940 --> 23:36.339
- What are you doing?
- I wanna show this to Thomas.

23:36.340 --> 23:38.339
But I thought you said
you can't handle it.

23:38.340 --> 23:40.379
No, I am not handling it,
I'm just gonna show it.

23:40.380 --> 23:43.339
I'm not gonna use it, man. It
doesn't even work with humans.

23:43.340 --> 23:46.015
Thomas, look at this gun!

23:46.980 --> 23:51.805
- That's not mine.
- You're a dealer, eh? -No.

23:51.940 --> 23:54.539
You hear this, sir? You
see what's happening?

23:54.540 --> 23:57.179
First Battalion, my friend.
You know what that means?

23:57.180 --> 23:59.779
That means that your days of
flaunting the law are over.

23:59.780 --> 24:02.179
Have a look, you see that? What's that?

24:02.180 --> 24:04.475
That's a firing team.

24:30.380 --> 24:32.140
Come here!

24:32.220 --> 24:34.419
Wikus! Are you all right?

24:34.420 --> 24:37.939
Where do you think you're going, eh?

24:37.940 --> 24:40.979
You don't run away from
the chopper. -No, no...

24:40.980 --> 24:46.950
Where do you think you're
going? You wanna piss me off?

24:52.340 --> 24:54.920
Koobus to base, come in!

24:55.540 --> 25:00.579
I've got two people down.
MNU guard, MNU agent.

25:00.580 --> 25:03.579
It's the Foxtrot
Yankee 5-3-0... copy?

25:03.580 --> 25:06.259
And we need a Med Evac ASAP.

25:06.260 --> 25:09.139
No, that's fine, Koobus.
I don't need a Med Evac.

25:09.140 --> 25:11.579
Wikus, you burned your
arm, you need to...

25:11.580 --> 25:15.020
I'll just treat it here, Koobus.

25:15.220 --> 25:18.779
Sir, I really think you must go to
a doctor, a hospital or something.

25:18.780 --> 25:21.259
- No, no.
- You should just get it checked out.

25:21.260 --> 25:24.819
I'll just have it treated
by the medics. Help me up.

25:24.820 --> 25:27.059
Did you see how fast
that prawn was, Trent?

25:27.060 --> 25:32.265
- Yeah, he was fast.
- He was fast, I promise you.

25:37.980 --> 25:41.059
Look, I fix it. I make it work.

25:41.060 --> 25:44.215
I told you not to touch that.

25:44.540 --> 25:46.460
What is wrong?

25:46.540 --> 25:50.379
Nothing. Go outside
and watch for humans.

25:50.380 --> 25:52.700
Where is your friend?

25:52.980 --> 25:55.100
He's gone.

26:05.340 --> 26:07.979
Are you okay? -Yeah,
I'm just a bit hot.

26:07.980 --> 26:11.459
Are you guys hot? Are
you hot, Trent? -No.

26:11.460 --> 26:16.619
Yeah, if you can't stand the
heat get out of the kitchen.

26:16.620 --> 26:20.535
Now you see. There's kids everywhere.

26:20.740 --> 26:23.619
This is what I mean. That's
why we get rid of them.

26:23.620 --> 26:26.059
- The little ones.
- Yeah, that's why we abort.

26:26.060 --> 26:29.779
Lets just shoot the little bastard.
- No, no, don't shoot it now.

26:29.780 --> 26:32.100
MNU agents! Come out!

26:32.180 --> 26:34.819
Hello, little guy.
MNU has sweets for you.

26:34.820 --> 26:37.499
There you go, eat your sweety.

26:37.500 --> 26:41.259
You know, eaty sweety. Works
like a charm every time.

26:41.260 --> 26:43.180
Oh fuck, man!

26:43.380 --> 26:46.819
You almost poked my eye out
with the fokkin' lollypop.

26:46.820 --> 26:49.499
I tried to be fokkin' nice to you, man!

26:49.500 --> 26:52.019
Is this your fokkin' little brat here?

26:52.020 --> 26:55.179
Inside, go! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26:55.180 --> 26:57.659
Teach him some manners.
Thomas, get him out.

26:57.660 --> 27:00.899
Come! Get down! I've had
enough of your stupid games.

27:00.900 --> 27:03.220
What do you want?

27:03.820 --> 27:05.819
We're from MNU. -I know.

27:05.820 --> 27:08.779
We require your scrawl on
this eviction notification.

27:08.780 --> 27:11.779
- Why am I being evicted?
- Yes, it's an eviction notice.

27:11.780 --> 27:15.139
Put your scrawl on the bottom.
See? There's your name at the top.

27:15.140 --> 27:18.139
- Yes! - Christopher Johnson? So, put
your name in the bottom.

27:18.140 --> 27:20.539
It says you must give
me 24 hours notice.

27:20.540 --> 27:23.659
You're going to another place. A nice
new city built especially for prawns.

27:23.660 --> 27:26.619
- A special place! - And we are not
even going to charge you, okay?

27:26.620 --> 27:31.680
This isn't legal. -Sign
the fokkin' paper! -No!

27:31.700 --> 27:35.059
This guy is obviously...
he's a little sharper.

27:35.060 --> 27:38.139
So we are gonna have
to try something else.

27:38.140 --> 27:40.379
All right. Hello... okay.

27:40.380 --> 27:43.739
Seems like we didn't understand
each other there properly, eh?

27:43.740 --> 27:46.139
So, you've got a little one there.

27:46.140 --> 27:48.739
Do you have a licence
for that little one? -Yes.

27:48.740 --> 27:52.299
There's a litter out here. This is
dangerous conditions for your child.

27:52.300 --> 27:55.499
Article 75 says that because
your child is living in dangerous

27:55.500 --> 27:58.299
conditions, I'm gonna take
him down to Child Services.

27:58.300 --> 28:00.499
I'm gonna go and have a
little chat with your son.

28:00.500 --> 28:03.510
You keep away from my child!

28:03.580 --> 28:06.059
Don't point your
fokkin' tentacles at me!

28:06.060 --> 28:08.059
You said you want to stay?

28:08.060 --> 28:10.859
Your boy is coming down
with me to Child Services.

28:10.860 --> 28:13.979
He's gonna spend the rest of
his life in 1 by 1 meter box.

28:13.980 --> 28:18.099
Hello, little guy! It's
the sweety man coming!

28:18.100 --> 28:21.825
Fuck, look at this, Trent! Fuck it!

28:22.100 --> 28:25.339
Thomas, keep the gun on him.
He is definitely a criminal!

28:25.340 --> 28:28.619
He's got a whole
computer shop here, man!

28:28.620 --> 28:31.659
You know, this is amazing.
I mean, this is obviously...

28:31.660 --> 28:35.179
you can see stolen computers now
that he's decorating his place with.

28:35.180 --> 28:37.979
Definitely he doesn't
have the permit for this.

28:37.980 --> 28:41.560
Where is that fokkin' little brat?

28:42.300 --> 28:45.405
Hello! It's the sweety man...

28:45.580 --> 28:49.880
It's the sweety... Hey, I've got this...

28:51.900 --> 28:54.955
- Wikus!
- Trent, turn it off!

28:55.900 --> 29:00.770
Are you okay, boss?
- Fuck off, man! Fuck off!

29:09.940 --> 29:15.190
Shall I leave him? -Just
fuckin' leave him, yeah.

29:15.380 --> 29:19.059
I'll see you tomorrow,
Christopher Johnson.

29:19.060 --> 29:22.019
<i>When dealing with aliens,
try to be polite, but firm.</i>

29:22.020 --> 29:25.459
<i>And always remember that a
smile is cheaper than a bullet.</i>

29:25.460 --> 29:28.419
Are you feeling better?
- What? -How are you feeling?

29:28.420 --> 29:31.819
I'm fine, I'm alright. I'm
just a little bit dizzy.

29:31.820 --> 29:34.419
Can you just pull up there on the side?

29:34.420 --> 29:38.910
I just want to get
something to eat here.

29:41.980 --> 29:44.619
Are you sure you should be having that?

29:44.620 --> 29:46.819
After your whole puking episode?

29:46.820 --> 29:51.299
I feel a lot better... I think I
just needed the fillings, you know.

29:51.300 --> 29:53.420
Boss! Boss!

29:54.100 --> 29:58.875
There's black stuff
coming out of your nose.

30:33.620 --> 30:35.540
Jesus!

30:58.580 --> 31:02.779
It's a silver cylinder. I can't find it.

31:02.780 --> 31:06.935
We must find it. It contains the fluid.

31:08.740 --> 31:10.660
It's not here.

31:10.780 --> 31:13.695
It has to be. Keep looking.

31:27.740 --> 31:31.035
We trade for ten thousand cans.

31:34.140 --> 31:36.699
Certain factions of nigerian gangs

31:36.700 --> 31:39.179
want to try and extract
weaponry from District 9.

31:39.180 --> 31:41.899
And have been trying
to for many many years.

31:41.900 --> 31:45.459
Give them one hundred cans.
- Hundred. -One hundred!

31:45.460 --> 31:48.059
Yes, yes, but we take them all now.

31:48.060 --> 31:53.070
Alright, boys! Get them the catfood
- hurry up.

31:53.100 --> 31:56.379
And they amassed
thousands of these weapons.

31:56.380 --> 31:59.259
Without the ability to use them.

31:59.260 --> 32:02.339
Fuck off! Go! Hey friend,
not you. You stay here.

32:02.340 --> 32:06.459
- What do you want from me?
- I just want to talk.

32:06.460 --> 32:08.780
Talk about what?

32:08.860 --> 32:11.739
Stupid prawn. They'll believe anything.

32:11.740 --> 32:14.539
Muti is a South African word.

32:14.540 --> 32:18.179
Today it's synonymous with
witchdoctory and magic.

32:18.180 --> 32:22.139
You cut it here. This is their heart.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.939
Cures high blood when you boil it,

32:24.940 --> 32:28.660
cures sugar, diabetes, all diseases.

32:30.140 --> 32:33.499
The nigerians were
consuming alien body parts.

32:33.500 --> 32:37.579
They believed that by doing so,
they were ingesting their power

32:37.580 --> 32:40.260
to use alien weaponry.

32:40.460 --> 32:42.980
You must eat them.

32:43.780 --> 32:47.315
And their power will live in you.

32:51.300 --> 32:57.300
Just give me a fucking chance
to go in front of you, man!

33:02.860 --> 33:06.379
Oh, baby! -Hi baby, come in! -I
need to get to the toilet, quickly!

33:06.380 --> 33:08.699
Why? What's the matter?

33:08.700 --> 33:14.700
Baby, listen. I might have
crapped in my pants. -Surprise!

33:16.100 --> 33:20.259
What's this for? -Your promotion.
- All right, my promotion!

33:20.260 --> 33:23.779
Hello, dad. How is it going?
Hi mom. -Good to see you.

33:23.780 --> 33:27.459
What a surprise, man!
- Congratulations. -Thanks.

33:27.460 --> 33:30.259
Congratulations, boss. -Thank you.

33:30.260 --> 33:33.459
- Wikus, what happened?
- I had a small incident, baby.

33:33.460 --> 33:36.859
I'm just gonna go to the toilet,
and then I'll talk to people, okay?

33:36.860 --> 33:39.699
I need to talk to you. Come with
me. -Okay, but I just gotta...

33:39.700 --> 33:42.179
Guys, can you give us a moment, please?

33:42.180 --> 33:44.539
What happened out there?

33:44.540 --> 33:48.539
This prawn wouldn't listen to
me, one really unruly prawn...

33:48.540 --> 33:51.859
and I just had to...
get him in my grasp.

33:51.860 --> 33:54.859
Listen to me, too many
aliens died out there today.

33:54.860 --> 33:57.419
UYO is all over my backside.

33:57.420 --> 34:00.819
Focus! you're not going
to fuck this up for me!

34:00.820 --> 34:06.460
If you can't do the job,
I'll find someone who can!

34:07.300 --> 34:10.579
Hi there! -Nice to see you again.

34:10.580 --> 34:14.299
Does this mean he's in
charge of this new operation?

34:14.300 --> 34:16.449
- Yes.
- That's nice.

34:16.500 --> 34:19.580
Wikus! Baby are you okay?

34:29.659 --> 34:32.480
Okay, let's cut some cake.

35:01.820 --> 35:07.355
<i>Doctor Smith, please come
to room 405, doctor Smith.</i>

35:11.140 --> 35:14.619
Is it badly infected?
- There's a lot of suppuration.

35:14.620 --> 35:18.539
Also you should know on my right hand
some fingernails were coming loose.

35:18.540 --> 35:24.540
And I had a black fluid coming out
of my nose, and sort of a black vomit.

35:26.020 --> 35:28.899
What is happening to my arm, doctor?

35:28.900 --> 35:31.020
What is this thing?

35:31.140 --> 35:34.299
Just breathe deeply.
Calm down. Stay calm.

35:34.300 --> 35:37.180
Sir, please tell my wife.

35:41.580 --> 35:46.920
<i>Attention all medical
containment evacuate ward 11.</i>

36:04.740 --> 36:06.939
Stop right there, madam.

36:06.940 --> 36:10.579
What's going on? What
are you doing to him?

36:10.580 --> 36:13.100
Let me through!

36:14.060 --> 36:18.165
Wikus! Wikus! Where are you taking him?

36:33.380 --> 36:37.535
Okay, got him? Are you ready? -Got him.

36:41.260 --> 36:44.419
We decided not to use the anesthetic,

36:44.420 --> 36:50.420
the reason being we can't know
how the subject will react.

37:00.180 --> 37:04.099
Doctor Fester! -Yes? -I
think you should see this.

37:04.100 --> 37:09.545
I found it in his jacket.
You think this is alien?

37:16.020 --> 37:18.790
Stop, it's freezing! Fuck!

37:20.900 --> 37:23.780
16 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

37:24.460 --> 37:26.780
Where is this?

37:30.300 --> 37:32.180
What?

37:35.740 --> 37:39.560
What are they doing to these prawns?

37:41.220 --> 37:44.610
Pain threshold, test one, DBX 7.

37:50.700 --> 37:55.419
That's a strong pain reaction.
That means the nerves have fused.

37:55.420 --> 37:58.619
I mean, it's almost
completely integrated.

37:58.620 --> 38:00.820
Okay, do it.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.860
B5. Testing AMR-B5.

38:06.620 --> 38:09.770
Clear the range. Now, quickly!

38:10.900 --> 38:13.180
Swing it around.

38:13.460 --> 38:17.179
What are you doing?
- The door is locked.

38:17.180 --> 38:19.579
Can you grip that? -What is this?

38:19.580 --> 38:22.219
- Put it through.
- Why are you doing this?

38:22.220 --> 38:26.339
- Standby for fire. Standby.
- You want me to shoot that?

38:26.340 --> 38:28.940
Stand back... and fire!

38:31.820 --> 38:33.780
That's good!

38:33.860 --> 38:36.020
It worked!

38:36.700 --> 38:39.279
All right, thanks very much.

38:39.314 --> 38:41.859
Do you know where my wife is?

38:41.860 --> 38:46.830
Do you know if my wife
knows where I am, sir?

38:47.580 --> 38:49.540
Pull! Pull!

38:49.620 --> 38:51.739
No sir, I will not pull.

38:51.740 --> 38:55.179
What did you say about
your wife? Fuck your wife!

38:55.180 --> 38:57.700
Pull! -I will not pull.

38:58.660 --> 39:00.460
Fire!

39:04.180 --> 39:09.055
B7. -I can pull it.
- He says he can pull it.

39:11.460 --> 39:15.615
I said I could pull it! You fuckin'...!

39:16.700 --> 39:18.620
B21.

39:21.780 --> 39:24.025
Move, hurry up. Move!

39:24.060 --> 39:27.099
Right, we want him in the center
by the chain. -Get this off me.

39:27.100 --> 39:29.250
Come on! Time, time!

39:29.300 --> 39:33.179
Leave that fucking prawn, man, I
will shoot at pig. I'll shoot, sir!

39:33.180 --> 39:36.379
Listen, I'll shoot at pig again
for you. I'll pull the trigger.

39:36.380 --> 39:39.859
But I'm not shooting at prawn,
you hear me? Untie the fucking gun.

39:39.860 --> 39:43.779
B21 in human hand.
That's good. It worked.

39:43.780 --> 39:47.219
Just untie the gun, sir. -Stand by.

39:47.220 --> 39:51.779
Listen, you can't use the real
guy, he didn't do anything to you.

39:51.780 --> 39:56.315
I want to try this.
Everybody standing by.

39:56.540 --> 40:00.075
Ready to go? Three, two, one, go!

40:04.740 --> 40:06.660
Amazing!

40:09.780 --> 40:13.890
All right! I think that's all we need.

40:14.620 --> 40:17.579
Gentlemen, we are running out of time.

40:17.580 --> 40:20.739
This is the key stage
in the metamorphosis.

40:20.740 --> 40:24.259
His DNA is in perfect balance
between alien and human.

40:24.260 --> 40:27.299
And a problem is, as
the infection spreads,

40:27.300 --> 40:30.259
the transition becomes
permanent and less active.

40:30.260 --> 40:33.059
He's going to turn into
one of them. A prawn!

40:33.060 --> 40:35.139
What happens to him isn't important.

40:35.140 --> 40:39.379
What's important is that we harvest
from him what we can right now.

40:39.380 --> 40:42.579
This body represents
hundreds of millions,

40:42.580 --> 40:46.019
maybe billions of dollars
worth of biotechnology.

40:46.020 --> 40:49.379
There are people out there,
governments, corporations,

40:49.380 --> 40:52.295
who'd kill for this chance.

40:52.740 --> 40:55.819
Will he survive the
procedure? -No, of course not.

40:55.820 --> 40:59.659
We need everything.
Tissue, bone marrow, blood.

40:59.660 --> 41:03.339
The procedure is gonna basically
strip him down to nothing. -Please...

41:03.340 --> 41:05.619
What about next of kin?

41:05.620 --> 41:08.419
Please help me. Don't let them do it.

41:08.420 --> 41:10.740
I'll handle that.

41:11.700 --> 41:15.905
Okay, I say let's go. -Good, thank you.

41:25.500 --> 41:28.020
I don't understand.

41:28.220 --> 41:34.220
None of this makes any sense.
He just hurt his arm, dad.

41:34.780 --> 41:38.099
The doctors are trying, sweetheart.

41:38.100 --> 41:41.205
Doing their best to save him.

41:41.940 --> 41:44.939
We're starting to harvest
material from the specimen.

41:44.940 --> 41:47.899
We'll start with the soft tissue
first. Cut through the chest cavern.

41:47.900 --> 41:50.859
We need to get the heart
out as quickly as possible.

41:50.860 --> 41:55.395
Once it set the
sinuosity, it just spread.

41:57.220 --> 42:01.660
You know Wikus. He
never was very strong.

42:02.740 --> 42:05.579
I'll go through the chest,
go straight into the heart.

42:05.580 --> 42:07.899
Be quiet, please. -Fuck you!

42:07.900 --> 42:10.100
Can I see him?

42:12.220 --> 42:14.180
Not a good idea.

42:19.220 --> 42:21.420
Fuck off! Fuck you!

42:32.420 --> 42:34.420
Fuck you!

42:38.060 --> 42:40.180
Drop the knife!

42:40.260 --> 42:43.259
Move or I'll fuckin' cut his throat!

42:43.260 --> 42:45.380
Okay. All right!

42:47.860 --> 42:50.250
I'll fuckin' kill him!

42:58.820 --> 43:02.120
You need to let go of him now.

43:04.700 --> 43:09.235
It's okay, Tania.
Everything will be okay.

43:16.820 --> 43:18.700
Smith.

43:20.780 --> 43:22.700
When?

43:25.020 --> 43:27.180
Get Koobus.

44:02.300 --> 44:04.499
<i>...Wikus Van De Merwe.</i>

44:04.500 --> 44:08.139
<i>White male, mid thirties. Is
considered highly dangerous.</i>

44:08.140 --> 44:11.339
- Hey baby.
- Wikus, is that you?

44:11.340 --> 44:13.659
- Mrs. Smith?
- How dare you phone us!

44:13.660 --> 44:16.699
What are all these people doing in
my house? -It's none of your business.

44:16.700 --> 44:19.739
I need to speak to Tania straight
away, please. It's my house.

44:19.740 --> 44:23.099
This is my phone that you're
using, mam. I'm fokkin'... what?

44:23.100 --> 44:25.260
He tried calling me.

44:25.340 --> 44:28.339
Anton, it's me! It's
me! Accept the call!

44:28.340 --> 44:32.059
I've been friends with you
for fokkin' 13 years, man!

44:32.060 --> 44:34.979
Fuck off! What are
you watching? Fuck off!

44:34.980 --> 44:37.939
We all thought it was for the
best because he needed help.

44:37.940 --> 44:39.939
A special medical help.

44:39.940 --> 44:44.670
And he wasn't gonna
get that as a fugitive.

44:48.100 --> 44:53.920
He became the most valuable
business artifact on Earth.

44:54.220 --> 44:57.179
He was the only human who had ever...

44:57.180 --> 45:01.339
successfully been combined with
alien genetics and remained alive.

45:01.340 --> 45:07.340
But his real value was that he
could operate alien weaponry.

45:12.940 --> 45:14.540
Hello.

45:14.660 --> 45:18.419
Can I get some cheese burgers
and one large sauerkraut, please.

He was on every radio station,
every image on television,

47:05.340 --> 47:08.339

find had his face on it.

So he had nowhere else to go. He
ended up hiding in the one place

47:12.300 --> 47:17.410
he knew no one would
ever come looking for him.

48:05.780 --> 48:08.660
40 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

48:33.220 --> 48:35.340
Pay now,or nothing.

48:35.540 --> 48:38.219
I pay you next week, I promise.

48:38.220 --> 48:44.220
No money - you get nothing. Fucking
prawn, this isn't charity.

48:44.940 --> 48:48.259
Hello, I'd like to
buy some meat, please.

48:48.260 --> 48:50.180
Hey, a man!

48:50.340 --> 48:54.419
Yes, have you got a
hamburger, or a steak roll?

48:54.420 --> 48:56.859
Does it look like a hamburger shop?

48:56.860 --> 48:59.179
Which one do you want? Goat?

48:59.180 --> 49:02.419
Come on, come on, I
don't have the whole day.

49:02.420 --> 49:05.499
Is that a cat food
there? -Yeah, yeah, it is.

49:05.500 --> 49:08.655
I'll have some of that, guys.

49:28.140 --> 49:30.060
Fuck, man!

49:49.300 --> 49:51.820
Hello, hello?

49:54.980 --> 49:57.660
Baby is that you? Tania?

49:58.340 --> 50:01.160
God, please let it be you.

50:01.180 --> 50:03.300
Yes, it's me.

50:04.580 --> 50:07.299
I'm so happy you called me, baby.

50:07.300 --> 50:10.540
Wikus, listen to me. -Okay.

50:11.580 --> 50:15.379
I have something to say to
you, and it's not gonna be easy.

50:15.380 --> 50:18.419
No, no, look... listen baby,
before you say anything...

50:18.420 --> 50:22.459
Your father is working against
me, but he's lying to you.

50:22.460 --> 50:25.419
I did not have sex with one of these...

50:25.420 --> 50:27.659
...fokkin' creatures, man!

50:27.660 --> 50:29.979
I would never have any kind of

50:29.980 --> 50:32.899
pornographic activity
with a fokkin' creature!

50:32.900 --> 50:38.299
They say that you're becoming
one of them. I can't do this...

50:38.300 --> 50:41.299
Baby please, don't give up on me.

50:41.300 --> 50:44.619
Don't give up on me
baby, because I can...

50:44.620 --> 50:47.299
I want to see you again, baby.

50:47.300 --> 50:50.219
I'm gonna fix my arm and
I'm gonna see you again,

50:50.220 --> 50:53.179
and I'm gonna kiss you and
I'm gonna hold you again.

50:53.180 --> 50:56.765
I also want you to hold me again.

50:58.340 --> 51:00.340
Baby?

51:01.940 --> 51:03.900
Baby?

51:16.860 --> 51:19.180
Hey! Hey man!

51:38.740 --> 51:40.660
Okay...

52:04.180 --> 52:07.659
<i>We are on tracking
directly to the location.</i>

52:07.660 --> 52:13.660
<i>Roger that. I'll send you a
couple of choppers for backup.</i>

52:29.540 --> 52:31.460
You!

52:31.620 --> 52:34.140
What do you want?

52:37.700 --> 52:41.099
<i>Come in, control, there
is our target moving to 66.</i>

52:41.100 --> 52:45.780
- You have to go.
- Please, I need your help.

52:46.300 --> 52:49.739
We're gonna play hide and
seek. -Yes! Yes! -No, get back.

52:49.740 --> 52:53.219
You want me to hide? Show me
your favorite hiding place.

52:53.220 --> 52:57.060
Please, just go. Leave us alone.

52:57.660 --> 53:00.575
No, please, I need to hide.

53:01.180 --> 53:03.340
They wanna kill me.

53:03.420 --> 53:09.295
I just need to hide in here,
sir, for 5 minutes, okay?

53:17.140 --> 53:20.139
What is this? What are you doing here?

53:20.140 --> 53:23.099
I remember you. -Nothing.
You must hide somewhere else.

53:23.100 --> 53:25.539
Sir... please sir, you have to help me.

53:25.540 --> 53:30.365
I'm losing blood,
they're trying to kill me.

53:38.300 --> 53:42.819
Only one thing that
could make that happen...

53:42.820 --> 53:46.260
Quick! We have to hide him.

53:48.860 --> 53:51.630
Now you... get down there.

54:03.980 --> 54:07.259
Where's the fluid?
What did you do with it?

54:07.260 --> 54:09.139
- Please!
- You took it...

54:09.140 --> 54:11.139
I don't know what you're talking about!

54:11.140 --> 54:14.979
...I know you did. I can
see what's happening to you.

54:14.980 --> 54:17.500
Tell me where it is.

54:18.860 --> 54:20.940
Alright, alright.

54:21.260 --> 54:24.459
Was it a black fluid
in a flask container?

54:24.460 --> 54:26.740
Yes, that's it. Yes!

54:27.100 --> 54:30.419
I confiscated it and the
guys at the lab took it.

54:30.420 --> 54:34.150
It will be at the MNU. MNU has it.

54:42.620 --> 54:44.740
What is this?

54:44.860 --> 54:49.010
- You ruined everything.
- Where is this?

54:51.900 --> 54:54.300
Is that your shack?

54:54.500 --> 54:57.459
This whole thing is under your shack?

54:57.460 --> 55:02.019
For 20 years you've... had
this fokking' thing in here?

55:02.020 --> 55:04.659
Jesus, this is very illegal.

55:04.660 --> 55:10.660
I mean, this is a find, you know.
I wish they catch you with this.

55:12.100 --> 55:14.300
Fuel goes in here.

55:14.420 --> 55:16.820
That's enough! Quiet!

55:16.900 --> 55:19.020
Then we fly away.

55:19.100 --> 55:21.579
I said quiet! We cannot trust him.

55:21.580 --> 55:25.499
What is he saying about the fuel?
Are you trying to start this thing?

55:25.500 --> 55:28.739
Are you little fuckers trying
to start this and get away?

55:28.740 --> 55:30.660
Never mind.

55:30.740 --> 55:33.099
Yeah, you sneaky fokkin' prawns.

55:33.100 --> 55:35.899
Too bad. I could've fixed you.

55:35.900 --> 55:39.779
What? What did you
say... about the fixing?

55:39.780 --> 55:42.139
What do you mean you could fix me?

55:42.140 --> 55:45.299
Forget it. It doesn't
matter, it's too late.

55:45.300 --> 55:48.299
No, listen! Listen. Are
you saying that you can...

55:48.300 --> 55:50.939
turn this prawn hand into a human hand?

55:50.940 --> 55:53.219
You can make me human again?

55:53.220 --> 55:57.339
We have medical machines on the
mothership that can fix you. Yes.

55:57.340 --> 56:01.259
We can use this ship to fly up there.

56:01.260 --> 56:03.859
That's fantastic! You
guys are brilliant!

56:03.860 --> 56:07.219
I always thought that prawns
were intelligent. Let's do it.

56:07.220 --> 56:09.340
I don't have fluid.

56:09.620 --> 56:14.179
I could fix you and I could fly
away. But I don't have fluid.

56:14.180 --> 56:16.140
Right, okay.

56:16.340 --> 56:18.739
All right, I tell you
what. Why don't we...

56:18.740 --> 56:21.819
go risk it some more?
Let's go collect some up.

56:21.820 --> 56:26.059
It took twenty years
to collect that amount.

56:26.060 --> 56:28.500
Fuck, man! Fuck!

56:28.820 --> 56:32.419
Fuck! The only one that exists
is the one I confiscated?

56:32.420 --> 56:34.140
Yes.

56:34.300 --> 56:37.450
It's four stories underground.

56:42.900 --> 56:46.739
Why does he keep looking at
me like that? -He likes you.

56:46.740 --> 56:48.860
We are the same.

56:50.220 --> 56:55.380
We're not the same. We're
not the fokkin' same.

57:00.460 --> 57:06.460
There is a way out of this.
We get the fluid back from MNU.

57:07.540 --> 57:10.419
Yeah, and what then?
Then we both die, eh?

57:10.420 --> 57:13.299
Both of us dead. That's
a suicide mission, man.

57:13.300 --> 57:17.739
Can you not fill my head
with that sort of nonsense?

57:17.740 --> 57:21.315
The transformation is accelerating.

57:22.740 --> 57:25.620
You don't have much time.

57:49.140 --> 57:52.020
56 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

58:14.660 --> 58:17.180
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

58:40.020 --> 58:41.820
Hello.

58:41.900 --> 58:44.780
- Wikus?
- Tania! Baby...

58:45.100 --> 58:48.499
- Are you okay?
- Oh God! Thank God...

58:48.500 --> 58:50.780
Where are you?

58:50.980 --> 58:52.900
I'am...

58:54.300 --> 59:00.300
It's not like my father said. I
know he was lying to protect me.

59:00.660 --> 59:03.619
I just don't know what
to believe anymore.

59:03.620 --> 59:06.019
Baby I know, but listen to me.

59:06.020 --> 59:10.939
It's all lies, I swear to you.
Everything he said to you is lies.

59:10.940 --> 59:14.020
- I know.
- What? What?

59:15.060 --> 59:18.099
I believe you, Wikus.
I just want you back.

59:18.100 --> 59:21.059
I want everything back the way it was.

59:21.060 --> 59:23.979
That's... baby, that's what I want.

59:23.980 --> 59:26.779
That's great! That's great news.

59:26.780 --> 59:30.779
I can make it the way it
was. If you take me back.

59:30.780 --> 59:34.100
How? How can we go back?

59:37.740 --> 59:40.859
I have a plan. I know how to fix it.

59:40.860 --> 59:43.339
I know how to fix myself.

59:43.340 --> 59:46.419
And it will be me. And
we'll be back together.

59:46.420 --> 59:50.525
- You promise me?
- I promise you, baby.

59:50.540 --> 59:53.099
Don't give up on me, okay?

59:53.100 --> 59:56.419
Because I haven't given
up on you. All right?

59:56.420 --> 59:58.460
I won't.

59:58.540 --> 01:00:01.790
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:07.510
Tell me you got a fix on him. -D9.

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:17.520
How many moons does our planet have?

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:23.180
Seven.

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:27.500
This planet only has one.

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:32.379
I can't wait to see our planet.
It's bigger than this one, isn't it?

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:34.460
Enough.

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:37.580
We go home now?

01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:41.300
Not home. No.

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:45.380
This is where we must go.

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:50.819
See that tent there? That might be ours.

01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:53.580
I want to go home!

01:00:54.740 --> 01:01:00.380
We can't go home. Not anymore.

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:09.619
Hi, you don't wanna go to the
tents, they are not better.

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:11.939
They're smaller than the shacks.

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:14.739
Actually, more like
a concentration camp.

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:19.059
If I can get you that black
fluid, what happens then?

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:21.659
We go up to the mothership.

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:25.385
And you can start that thing? -Yes.

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:31.040
Okay, so just to be clear:
this is gonna go back...

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:36.019
This is gonna go back
to human like this.

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:39.219
I can go home and then you can go home.

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:42.059
You can take your boy, you
can take all the prawns,

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.459
if I can get you that fluid, right?

01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:49.859
You said it was a suicide
mission. Maybe you were right.

01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:54.875
We have no weapons.
They'll shoot us on sight.

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:57.939
Look, look... Christopher...

01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:01.380
I know where we can get weapons.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.780
Hi guys. Hello.

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:16.659
I would like to buy
some weapons, please.

01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:19.910
How did you do this like that?

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:23.099
A doggie style with the demon.

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.100
I love it!

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:29.619
One brave white man, eh?
Were you wearing a condom?

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:32.820
I need to buy weapons, please.

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:37.179
You and I both know that there
are illegal weapons inside here.

01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:42.960
I have money and I would
like to buy some of those...

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:50.420
Sit!

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:08.979
Thank you sir for your time.
Thank you very much for seeing me.

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:12.099
I would like to buy some weapons.

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:16.019
AK-47, some grenades...
maybe tear gas canisters.

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:19.099
I see you have limpet
mines here aswell, and I..

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:23.099
also see you guys have alien
weapons there, which is great!

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.939
If I could have one or two of those.

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:29.285
I have money, okay? Now, I'm...

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:35.980
Sir! Please, sir!

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:38.419
I've heard about you.

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:41.499
Where do you have it? Show me!

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.260
Oh, shit!

01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:46.180
Come here. Come.

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:54.460
No, no... don't please!

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:03.179
Why are you doing
this? What do you want?

01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:05.100
Shut up!

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:11.299
Forget the weapons! Forget the weapons!

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:14.265
I want the arm. Cut it off.

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:17.260
What is he saying?

01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.660
I'll show you.

01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:35.300
Holy shit!

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:42.550
You tell them to stand down!

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:50.985
You tell them to be quiet! To back off!

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:55.379
Tell them to put the
fokkin' weapons in the bag!

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:58.865
Give me the fokkin' weapons, man!

01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:01.659
Don't you, sir, look at me.

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:05.150
I said don't fokkin' look at me!

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:12.200
How did you get that hand?

01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.899
Fokkin' hurry up there!

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:18.099
Look at me when I fuckin' speak
to you. What is your secret?

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.825
What did you do? Tell me!

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:25.259
I want that fuckin' arm.
What the fuck did you do?

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:27.899
You fuckin' mazungo, I'm coming for you!

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:31.059
I'm coming for you
and I'm gonna get you!

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:36.260
Drop your fokkin' knife.
Drop your fokkin' knife!

01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:46.539
He's useless to us
dead. -Would you relax?

01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:50.259
For fuck's sakes, my men have
done this a hundred times before.

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:54.125
<i>Maintaining a visual on the location.</i>

01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:57.779
It's gonna be quick.

01:05:57.780 --> 01:05:59.980
It's gonna be clean.

01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:04.445
Best of all, it's gonna be quiet.

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:10.810
Van De Merwe hasn't got a
clue what's coming his way.

01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:14.550
It's empty! -Where are they?

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:17.579
Target is gone. The place is empty.

01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:20.579
What do you mean, empty?
Where the fuck is he?

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:24.019
That little shithead has got
no idea what is coming his way.

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:26.300
I'm gonna find him.

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:40.700
There are the guards! At the gate!
Watch the guards at the gate, man!

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:47.300
Move! Get out!

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:55.259
They're going down. Four stories down.

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:59.379
This is alien weaponry.
Give me a status report.

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:01.779
It's Van De Merwe. He's on level four.

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:04.459
Switch to live, and then
we're taking him out.

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:07.419
Colonel, we weren't allowed
to use live ammunition.

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:09.980
They want him alive.

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:16.459
Stay here until I call
you. -I understand.

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:19.520
I need to get the door open.

01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:23.605
No! I said stay until I call you!

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:30.380
Fuck!

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:34.339
I thought you said not to kill them?

01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:36.620
He shot at me!

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.859
Fuck! Get out! Don't fuckin' look at me!

01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:43.680
Get out! Get the fuck out!

01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:59.619
Get out! Everybody get the fuck out!

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:01.940
Get out! Go!

01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:04.820
Move the fuck out! Go!

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:09.339
What is this place?
- Don't worry about that.

01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:12.220
What do they do in here?

01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:15.940
Check these boxes.

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:19.859
Any type of a box that looks like it
can hold a tube. Just check it out!

01:08:19.859 --> 01:08:21.979
These fuckers!

01:08:24.939 --> 01:08:26.859
Go, go, go...

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:30.620
Clear.

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.859
I got it! I got it!

01:08:41.859 --> 01:08:44.729
Chris, I got it. Let's go!

01:08:45.899 --> 01:08:47.899
Christopher!

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:52.660
Oh, fuck!

01:08:52.859 --> 01:08:56.499
Listen... I promise you, I
didn't know they were doing this.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:59.339
Until they brought
me here the other day,

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:02.538
I swear to you I did not know
they were doing this to you guys.

01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:05.459
But Christopher... look
at me. Listen to me.

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:08.179
We need to leave now. Okay?

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:10.939
The whole of MNU is
gonna come down here.

01:09:10.939 --> 01:09:13.665
He's going to destroy us.

01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:18.379
We can do this, okay? We're
gonna get out of here...

01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:20.020
Fire!

01:09:20.859 --> 01:09:22.779
Move, move!

01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:26.740
Shoot at the prawn!

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:39.930
Christopher! What the
fuck are you doing?

01:09:45.819 --> 01:09:49.354
Think of your boy, for fuck sake!

01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:03.019
What the hell are you doing?
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:08.180
You're gonna get us
killed! -What do we do now?

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:11.899
I thought you had a way out?

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:14.299
I didn't say anything about the way out.

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:17.539
I promised you that we'll get
in. We're in! -I have an idea.

01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:21.120
- Where are you going?
- Follow me!

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:28.099
What are you doing? -Making a bomb.

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:30.020
Let's go!

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:44.420
Quick! Get in!

01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:47.300
Go! Drive!

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.780
Okay!

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:53.700
Okay, hold on!

01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:56.500
Fuck!

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:05.579
Reports are coming in of
explosion in downtown Johannesburg.

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:07.979
Well, there was a terrorist attack,

01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:13.659
but I can assure you that we
dealt with it. Everything is fine.

01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:17.670
Droop it down! Droop it down! Decline!

01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:28.380
They are really close to us now!

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:32.620
Shit!

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:39.215
Let's go, let's go!

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:43.860
Don't drop that fokkin' thing!

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.939
Come on, move! Get down there!

01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:58.330
Go down and initiate
the binary commands.

01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:01.810
Set it down right now!

01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:05.019
When we get up to the mothership,
how long is this gonna take?

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:07.619
- To do what?
- The fixing. To fix me.

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:10.419
It's going to take a bit
longer than I thought.

01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:12.619
Okay, that's fine. How long do you need?

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.740
Three years.

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:17.659
Sorry, just go slowly
with the clicks there,

01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:21.059
it sounded like you said
"three years", like human years.

01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:23.580
Yes. Three years.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.579
What? Three fuckin' years?

01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:29.300
I will fix you,

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:32.819
but first I must save my people.

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:35.939
The deal was: you go home, I get fixed!

01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:39.979
I will not let my people
be medical experiments!

01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:42.739
I'm a fokkin' medical experiment!
You hear me, Christopher?

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:45.259
I'm a fokkin' medical experiment, man!

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:48.019
I must go home and get help.

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:52.179
I must use all the
fluid to travel quickly.

01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:56.419
I'll just stay here, Christopher?
I'll just stay here in this shack.

01:12:56.420 --> 01:13:00.099
And I'll see you in three years
time? -I will come back. I promise.

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:01.940
Christopher!

01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:25.380
Where the fuck is he?

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:30.859
Hey, you're hiding
Wikus down there, my boy?

01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:33.340
- Father?
- No, no, no.

01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:37.579
Your daddy needs to stay here to
sort out a few things, alright?

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:43.580
We're gonna go. We're gonna
come back and fetch him, okay?

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:47.659
In here? -In there.
- Goes in here?

01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:51.625
How the fuck do you open this, prawn?

01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:54.900
Father.

01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:59.179
Show me, you fucker. You
want me to fuckin' kill you?

01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:02.810
Is that what you fuckin' want, eh?

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:20.299
Right... there's no buttons.

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:21.820
On!

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:23.940
Activate?

01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:26.575
My teachers teach only:

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:29.020
One prawn, one bullet.

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:38.339
I can't believe I get paid to do this.

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:41.635
I love watching you prawns die.

01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:45.780
Fuck, man!

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:56.540
Father!

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:02.500
Get out! Get out!

01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:11.345
This is remarkable.

01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:14.379
It looks like something is
emerging from the ground.

01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:17.699
Something is definitely
coming out of the ground.

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:19.620
Okay... steady!

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:29.499
Go sit down, I can't play with ya now.

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:32.180
Uncle Wikus is flying.

01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:35.460
Bug off. Bug off!

01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:44.150
Lock the weapon at target!

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:46.740
Fire when locked.

01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:52.459
It seems to be drifting towards
the center of the territory.

01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:55.615
We have a lock on him. -Fire!

01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:59.339
Something is fired
upon... it has been hit!

01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:01.339
What the fuck is that?

01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:04.339
One of the engines is billowing
smoke, it's out of control.

01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:10.340
It's going down, boss. Should
I send the boys to fuck him up?

01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:14.939
Now... it hit the ground,
the massive impact,

01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:18.190
and it's come to a standstill.

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:25.580
My son! My son's in there!

01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:28.619
Shut the fuck up! Get
this fucker inside.

01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:32.539
We're moving out. Come,
let's go, let's go...

01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:34.100
Move!

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:37.939
We're banking around now, trying
to get a better view of the ship

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:43.940
which is absolutely wrecked, waiting
for some of the smoke to clear.

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:44.539
Somebody has been brought
out of the vehicle.

01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:46.739
It looks like a human being.

01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:49.499
We are getting unconfirmed
reports that this might be

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:52.379
Wikus Van De Merwe, a fugitive
that has been on the run

01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:54.779
from MNU for the past 3 days.

01:17:54.780 --> 01:18:00.780
They are loading him into a
vehicle now, and heading off.

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:04.060
72 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:26.700
What the fuck?

01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:42.960
We caught him, boss. -Bring him to me.

01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:00.380
Come on! Get back!

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:03.620
Oh, fuck!

01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:15.100
Control, we're taking enemy fire!
We need support. Backup, now!

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:20.880
Fuck off! Fuck off, man!

01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:35.030
Get you hands off me!
Fuckin' get off me!

01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:40.260
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:18.739
Didn't I tell you...
that I'm gonna get you?

01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:23.819
You came in here and you left
with something that belongs to me.

01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:25.900
Fuck you.

01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:35.380
Fuck you all!

01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:16.739
I told you that the day will come.

01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:20.419
You've been running
around with my prize.

01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:24.339
All I want is to eat that
hand and become like you.

01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:26.700
No! It won't work...

01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:33.819
Once I have that power,
no one will stop me.

01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:37.500
It was your turn... now it's mine!

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:46.060
Fighting MNU security forces,
this armed faction is doomed...

01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:51.740
Now I'm gonna eat, my friend.

01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:17.420
We're getting reports claiming that
the alien device is activating...

01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:16.539
You see that prawn back
in the Casper? -Yeah.

01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:19.619
He knows what the fuck
is up with that ship.

01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:24.490
Get that fucker out and
get him talking, now.

01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:40.339
Three contractors are closing in
on the nigerian compound, and...

01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:42.780
Come, alien!

01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:55.300
What's your plan?

01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:20.140
How are you doing it?

01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:22.785
Who's moving that ship?

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:27.420
All right, that's very clever.

01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:37.540
Wait for my command. Make
sure you fuckin' shoot to kill.

01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:44.625
Fuck! Move it! Move it!

01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:48.500
Bring that fucker down!

01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:58.579
Hold you fire! Hold your
fire and keep your positions!

01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:00.820
It's Van De Merwe.

01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:03.420
Hey, Dickus!

01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:20.019
I'll come back for prawn, alright guys?

01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:22.219
Do you hear me, now? -Run, Wikus!

01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:24.380
- You hear me?
- Run!

01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:27.259
And keep on running, you fuckin' coward!

01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:29.340
Run! Run!

01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:37.660
Get the air support up, and
get on his fuckin' trail, now!

01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:41.659
It's not gonna work,
boss. He's a tough one.

01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:46.960
He's not gonna talk. -Then
just fuckin' kill him.

01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:01.659
<i>He's not gonna talk. -Then
just fuckin' kill him.</i>

01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:03.180
Fuck!

01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:05.779
<i>He's a tough one. He's not gonna talk.</i>

01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:08.645
<i>Then just fuckin' kill him.</i>

01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:33.499
Hey, c'mon. Get up! I'm
gonna get you out of here.

01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:37.299
- I can't... it's too far.
- It's not too fokkin' far. Get up!

01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:40.659
I'm gonna get you there. I'm
gonna get you to your boy!

01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:43.060
C'mon, stay behind me!

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:55.620
Go back!

01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:01.100
Run, run, run!

01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:10.019
Arriving at the location now.
We have a clearance to engage.

01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:14.030
Prawns are coming, get down, get down!

01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:33.819
There are headed for a drop
site. Knock these fuckers off!

01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:36.160
Come to mommy, come...

01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:41.020
Fuck!

01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:48.060
Shit!

01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:51.180
Are you hurt?

01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:54.539
We can make it. I was shot in the arm.

01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:57.170
We can make it, come on!

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:15.379
Listen, you go ahead. You can make it.

01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:19.179
I'm gonna just... hold them off
here, and I'll join you soon.

01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:23.059
No, we stick together.
I'm not leaving you here.

01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:26.019
Take your boy and go
home. You have to make it.

01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:28.899
Don't make me go through
all of this and not make it.

01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:32.219
Do you understand? -I
will come back for you.

01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:35.659
Go! Go now before I change my mind! Go!

01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:38.300
Three years. I promise.

01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:05.910
I'm not fuckin' scared of you!

01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:14.780
Quit fuckin' with me!

01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:01.465
You want me? You want me?

01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:07.940
Is that all you got?

01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:12.230
Is that all you fuckin' got?

01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:17.859
Some kind of quite extraordinary
light from the mothership.

01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:23.860
I've never seen anything like
it. It's a beam of light...

01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:30.700
Full scan. Okay.

01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:35.900
Fire!

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:12.020
Get to the vehicle, now! Get
going. -Yes colonel. -Go, go, go!

01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:34.820
Fuck!

01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:38.579
Quit playing with me, Koobus!

01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:40.700
You fucker!

01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:01.540
Go, Chris, go.

01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:04.220
Go home.

01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:38.860
We go home now?

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:40.900
Yes.

01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:51.460
74 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:07.660
Unbelievable.

01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:13.475
Now I know why everybody
wants a piece of you.

01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:17.659
I can't wait for those
med boys to cut you up.

01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:19.780
But you know what?

01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:22.859
You're not gonna waste
any more of my time.

01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:25.965
You half-breed piece of shit!

01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:31.215
I'm gonna just fuckin' kill you myself.

01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:41.395
Stay back, you fuck! Stay back!

01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:45.300
Stay back!

01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:10.419
The people everywhere
across Johannesburg

01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:13.619
are flooding the streets and
pouring out of their offices

01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:17.739
and all eyes are pointed up towards
the sky on this momentous day.

01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:21.299
It's the first time, ladies and
gentlemen, in over two decades,

01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:24.499
that the mothership has
shown any sign of movement,

01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:27.259
and people are tremendously excited.

01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:30.419
The city had come to
an absolute standstill.

01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:34.059
Everybody wants to know
what's going to happen next.

01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:37.419
There's no way of knowing whether or
not Christopher Johnson will return.

01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:39.659
We don't know if he was simply escaping,

01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:43.659
whether he will effect a rescue plan...

01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:46.259
...and, as the so
called free press says,

01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:52.260
whether or not he will come
back and declare a war on us.

01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:17.939
This is the last known
footage of Wikus Van De Merwe.

01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:23.139
And we can only speculate as
to what has happened to him.

01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:26.779
The more zany conspiracy
theories state that

01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:30.419
he's been captured by MNU
or by another government.

01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:33.419
Or by perhaps some
shady government agency

01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:36.299
and he's actually
being held in captivity.

01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:39.179
If we knew where he was,
we would try and help him,

01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:42.539
and that is the most difficult
part, not knowing where he is.

01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:46.659
Wikus, sadly, is gone but
I'm the one who stays behind

01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:50.779
with all the questions.
I can't give the answers.

01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:55.099
He died in my mind a long
time ago. And that's that.

01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:59.019
Wikus Van Der Merwe is a name
that will become very widely known

01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:03.059
because of this pivotal role that
he played in this whole event.

01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:06.619
He was an honest man, and he didn't
deserve any of what happened to him.

01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:09.979
I mean, I know. I looked into a
computer system and I found stuff.

01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:13.259
I mean, the whole data
was there, you know?

01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:16.619
They didn't even do a
good job of hiding it.

01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:19.779
<i>Fundiswa Mhlanga is
currently awaiting trial</i>

01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:23.219
<i>for exposing MNU's illegal
genetic research program.</i>

01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:25.980
<i>District 9 was demolished</i>

01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:29.259
<i>after the alien resettlement
operation was completed.</i>

01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:33.099
<i>District 10 now houses 2.5 million
aliens and continues to grow...</i>

01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:37.139
You guys haven't seen a picture of
my wife. Let me show you my wife.

01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:39.339
She's my special angel.

01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:42.299
She even looks like an angel
with veil, you want to see that?

01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:45.099
Look, you see, with the
white veil over the...

01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:48.859
she even looks like an angel.
Everyone says that his wife is angel,

01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:52.019
but this is a real angel that
you see there, on the cameras.

01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:57.325
They won't put that in
the video, I don't think.

01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:02.179
I found this at my front door.

01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:06.219
As tho somebody had just left it there.

01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:09.019
My friends say that I
should throw it away,

01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:11.779
cause it's just a piece of rubbish.

01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:15.819
That it couldn't possibly come from him.

01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:18.140
I know it's true.
