00:41.508 --> 00:43.643
Roman, Roman, right here!

00:43.710 --> 00:45.478
- Sign mine.
- Sign mine, Roman.

00:45.545 --> 00:46.579
Right here.

00:46.646 --> 00:49.716
Whoo, whoo... Wow!

00:50.517 --> 00:52.485
Uso.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.187
Uso.

00:55.422 --> 00:56.256
Hear me.

00:56.323 --> 00:58.125
Yes.

00:58.191 --> 01:00.127
I am the Big Show.

01:00.193 --> 01:01.994
I'm the future champion.

01:03.863 --> 01:04.931
He's big in person.

01:04.997 --> 01:06.766
Gigantic!

01:06.833 --> 01:08.335
Gotta get to see...

01:08.401 --> 01:11.171
Big Show, oh, oh, can I have
your autograph?

01:11.238 --> 01:13.005
You want my autograph?

01:13.072 --> 01:14.341
Um... Yes.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.309
You want my autograph?

01:16.376 --> 01:19.212
I wouldn't have asked if I didn't.

01:19.279 --> 01:24.517
You just got the signature of the future
WWE World Heavyweight Champion.

01:24.584 --> 01:26.753
Wrong, Big Show.

01:26.819 --> 01:32.959
Everyone knows that I am
the undisputed future of WWE.

01:33.025 --> 01:35.428
And I will be the champ.

01:35.495 --> 01:38.998
Well, neither one of you fellows
are gonna be the champ.

01:39.065 --> 01:41.100
While I hold the title.

01:41.168 --> 01:42.502
It's Sheamus.

01:42.569 --> 01:44.504
- Hooray!
- What... What?

01:44.571 --> 01:45.938
- It's Sheamus.
- Yeah.

01:46.005 --> 01:47.039
He's my favorite.

01:47.106 --> 01:49.442
Hello, my friends in Denver.

01:49.509 --> 01:51.311
In case you haven't heard,

01:51.378 --> 01:55.982
Big Show here has earned himself a match
with me tomorrow at Smack Down.

01:56.048 --> 01:59.219
And he thinks he'll be taking
my title away from me.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.124
Boo!

02:05.192 --> 02:10.062
I mean... Well, you're okay,
but Sheamus is better.

02:10.128 --> 02:12.332
Tomorrow night, you're going down.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.867
You better find something else
to hold your pants up.

02:14.934 --> 02:18.671
Because you can kiss that
championship belt goodbye.

02:18.738 --> 02:21.241
I'm just waiting for you
in Albuquerque, Big man.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.675
Bring it on!

02:22.742 --> 02:25.578
Nobody is bringing anything,
anywhere tonight.

02:25.645 --> 02:26.746
Mr. McMahon.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.548
Oh, it's Mr. McMahon.
Can you believe it?

02:28.615 --> 02:32.719
Big show, Sheamus,
as Chairman and CEO of WWE,

02:32.785 --> 02:34.053
and your boss,

02:34.120 --> 02:37.257
I must postpone tomorrow
night's match on Smack Down.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.125
- What?
- What?

02:39.192 --> 02:40.760
What?

02:40.827 --> 02:43.396
A massive snowstorm is just
about to hit the Denver area.

02:43.463 --> 02:46.098
The highway patrol
is closing down all roads.

02:46.165 --> 02:49.236
Big Show, I'm afraid your
title match will have to wait.

02:49.302 --> 02:50.837
Not again, McMahon.

02:50.903 --> 02:53.640
I've waited a long time for
my chance to get the title.

02:53.706 --> 02:57.176
I'm not letting a little
frozen water get in my way.

02:57.244 --> 03:00.046
But the bus can't drive in this weather.

03:00.112 --> 03:02.249
Who said anything about driving?

03:07.520 --> 03:09.322
Big Show, please.

03:09.389 --> 03:11.724
- You gotta turn back.
- Forget it, McMahon.

03:11.791 --> 03:15.228
I'm going to be World Heavyweight
Champion tomorrow night.

03:15.295 --> 03:17.664
And nothing will stop me.

03:25.338 --> 03:27.874
- Dumb technology.
- Big Show.

03:27.940 --> 03:29.309
Turn back.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.577
Turn!

03:39.652 --> 03:41.754
You want a piece of me, gravity?

03:41.821 --> 03:43.790
You think you can take me down?

03:43.856 --> 03:45.525
Let's get it on.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.726
* Meet George Jetson *

04:24.531 --> 04:26.599
* His boy, Elroy *

04:30.503 --> 04:32.705
* Daughter, Judy *

04:36.576 --> 04:38.010
* Jane, his wife *

06:04.230 --> 06:06.699
Oh, this is grueling labor.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.968
I work my finger to the bone
for this company...

06:09.035 --> 06:11.504
...and yet I'm completely
under-appreciated.

06:11.571 --> 06:14.474
The next time I see that
old miser Mr. Spacely,

06:14.541 --> 06:16.843
I'm gonna demand a raise.

06:16.909 --> 06:18.077
Jetson!

06:18.144 --> 06:20.346
- You're...
- Oh, no, please, Mr. Spacely,

06:20.413 --> 06:21.848
- I... I'm sorry...
- Hired!

06:21.914 --> 06:25.452
Oh, I understand completely,
Mr. Spacely.

06:25.518 --> 06:27.420
I'll clean out my office immediately.

06:27.487 --> 06:29.388
Office, let's pack up.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.661
No, Jetson, I said you're hired.

06:34.727 --> 06:38.030
Hired? Haven't I been
hired this whole time?

06:38.097 --> 06:41.734
Okay, maybe that was a
confusing way of phrasing this.

06:41.801 --> 06:45.071
Point is, I need you, George Jetson,

06:45.137 --> 06:46.973
to take on a new project.

06:47.039 --> 06:49.976
Oh, boy! Are you talking
about a promotion?

06:50.042 --> 06:52.879
Well, if doing more work
for the same money,

06:52.945 --> 06:55.147
sounds like a promotion to you.

06:55.214 --> 06:57.950
Then let's call it a promotion.

06:58.017 --> 06:59.819
That's exactly what I'm gonna call it.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.621
I won't let you down, Mr. Spacely.

07:01.688 --> 07:03.022
You better not.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.692
Or you're fired!

07:05.758 --> 07:08.761
Report to the shuttle bay
in five minutes.

07:08.828 --> 07:12.431
And, Jetson. No surprises!

07:12.499 --> 07:15.101
Oh, boy! "Report to the shuttle bay."

07:15.167 --> 07:16.603
That means a business trip.

07:16.669 --> 07:18.971
I hope the old space suit still fits.

07:26.012 --> 07:28.515
Last time I wore this,
I was on the moon.

07:28.581 --> 07:30.483
Guess I weighed a little less there.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.920
Ah... There we go.

07:48.868 --> 07:50.803
Pardon me. Coming through.

07:50.870 --> 07:53.372
Hey, what's the big idea, George?

07:53.439 --> 07:55.908
That guy is a galactic goofball.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.645
More like a pain in the Plutoids.

08:01.347 --> 08:04.383
Heya, George. Here to
hide out from Spacely again?

08:04.450 --> 08:08.555
Not today. Mr. Spacely promoted me
for an extra special project.

08:14.493 --> 08:18.698
Wow! Spacely Sprockets X-9000 robots.

08:18.765 --> 08:21.634
My new project must be hugely important.

08:21.701 --> 08:23.435
George Jetson?

08:23.502 --> 08:26.072
This new project is doomed.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.107
Careful there, Benedict.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.710
Extremely crucial project going on here.

08:30.777 --> 08:33.011
No room for mistakes today.

08:34.212 --> 08:35.715
No room for mistakes, huh?

08:35.782 --> 08:38.116
Then how did they make room
for you on the project?

08:39.552 --> 08:41.854
Just gonna squeeze in here.

08:41.921 --> 08:44.123
Okay! I'm ready to go.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.826
Oh, I can't wait to get
the details on this project.

08:46.893 --> 08:48.695
Launch in five...

08:48.761 --> 08:50.096
...four...

08:50.162 --> 08:51.397
Three, two...

08:51.463 --> 08:52.865
Whoa! Hold the launch.

08:52.932 --> 08:55.267
Hold the launch.
I better take this.

08:56.502 --> 08:57.870
Hello, Mr. Jetson.

08:57.937 --> 09:01.007
Your lovely beautiful wife
is on line one.

09:02.742 --> 09:04.677
I can't talk right now.
Take a message, please.

09:04.744 --> 09:06.913
But, Mr. Jetson, it's your wife.

09:06.979 --> 09:09.548
Are you sure you
don't want to take this?

09:10.950 --> 09:13.620
Big project.
Gotta go now. Bye.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.187
So, where we headed?

09:15.254 --> 09:16.388
One...

09:23.162 --> 09:25.331
Your husband isn't available,
Mrs. Jetson.

09:25.397 --> 09:28.300
Not available like he's on his way
to his son's science fair,

09:28.367 --> 09:29.969
where he's supposed to be?

09:30.036 --> 09:33.105
Or not available like he's putting
work before his family again?

09:33.172 --> 09:34.506
He didn't specify.

09:34.573 --> 09:36.108
But if I were a betting woman...

09:36.175 --> 09:39.011
...I know where I'd put my money
if you catch my drift.

09:40.847 --> 09:42.248
May I take a message?

09:42.314 --> 09:44.784
No. I'll either to talk to him
when he gets here...

09:44.851 --> 09:46.218
...or yell at him when he gets home.

09:46.285 --> 09:50.122
Uh-oh. Someone's in trouble.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.926
Look at this place.

09:53.993 --> 09:57.596
Three cold fusion experiments and
a vinegar and baking soda volcano?

09:57.664 --> 10:00.466
No one else has anything
as sophisticated...

10:00.467 --> 10:02.334
...as my time travel equation.

10:03.202 --> 10:04.136
Where's Dad?

10:04.203 --> 10:06.205
He promised he'd be here, Elroy.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.841
He's probably just trying
to find a parking spot.

10:08.908 --> 10:10.743
Or at least he'd better be.

10:27.493 --> 10:29.729
Wow. The surface of the Earth.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.331
So natural. So primitive.

10:33.632 --> 10:36.302
So disgusting.

10:38.070 --> 10:39.138
Unit one,

10:39.205 --> 10:41.240
what on earth are we doing on the Earth?

10:41.307 --> 10:44.076
We have been ordered to
drill a hole for a new piling.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.845
And what am I supposed to do?

10:45.912 --> 10:47.379
You are in charge.

10:47.446 --> 10:48.881
In charge, huh?

10:48.948 --> 10:50.783
I like the sound of that.

10:50.850 --> 10:53.385
Well, then.
You boys get to drilling,

10:54.386 --> 10:55.855
I'll stay here and...

10:55.922 --> 10:58.224
Be in charge.

11:00.392 --> 11:03.129
Commence re-calculated drill procedure.

11:06.432 --> 11:07.666
Ah, yes.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.802
A lot of responsibility.

11:09.869 --> 11:11.470
Lot of responsibility.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.307
Mr. Jetson.

11:15.374 --> 11:16.876
Huh? What? Who?

11:16.943 --> 11:19.078
I wasn't sleeping.
You were sleeping.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.280
Mr. Jetson, we found something.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.249
Well, what do you know.

11:23.315 --> 11:25.484
There was already a hole in your hole.

11:25.551 --> 11:29.055
Protocol states, we cannot continue
drilling until our Supervisor...

11:29.121 --> 11:31.623
...has inspected the site
and declared it safe.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.492
Ah... Me?

11:33.559 --> 11:34.827
Uh-huh.

11:34.894 --> 11:37.797
Any chance I can do that
from right here?

11:37.864 --> 11:39.331
Uh-uh.

11:39.398 --> 11:41.633
No? Oh... Okay.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.035
I'm going in.

11:43.736 --> 11:45.171
Bye-bye.

11:46.338 --> 11:48.775
Boy, what a scaredy-cat.

11:48.841 --> 11:50.910
You're gonna be fine, George.

11:50.977 --> 11:52.178
Everything is okay, George.

11:52.244 --> 11:53.645
You're gonna be fine, George.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.647
Everything...

11:55.714 --> 11:58.384
Hey, guys, I made it.

11:58.450 --> 11:59.886
It looks pretty safe to me.

11:59.952 --> 12:01.353
Keep going, sir.

12:01.420 --> 12:02.889
Oh, darn it!

12:02.955 --> 12:04.323
Dumb drill bot.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.593
Who tells who what to do
around here anyway?

12:07.659 --> 12:08.828
Oh...

12:08.895 --> 12:10.462
Who killed the lights?

12:10.529 --> 12:12.331
Spacesuit lights to maximum.

12:13.465 --> 12:15.167
Huh, much better.

12:33.285 --> 12:36.522
Well, I can't just leave him here.

12:36.588 --> 12:40.092
Boys, I think I'm gonna need
some help down here!

12:41.160 --> 12:44.496
Oh... Look at this poor
old-fashioned fella.

12:44.563 --> 12:45.832
Frozen in ice.

12:45.898 --> 12:48.134
This is some surprise.
Right, guys?

12:48.200 --> 12:51.237
Mr. Spacely said no surprises.

12:55.607 --> 12:58.978
Come on. Come on.
Melt faster. Melt faster.

13:04.183 --> 13:07.086
Shh... Be quiet.
Mr. Spacely said no surprises.

13:07.153 --> 13:09.889
And you are one big seven-foot surprise!

13:09.956 --> 13:12.091
Would you be quiet?

13:12.158 --> 13:13.525
You're gonna get me fired.

13:14.793 --> 13:17.363
What?

13:17.429 --> 13:18.564
What?

13:18.630 --> 13:20.199
Oh, my bad.

13:20.266 --> 13:21.400
Where am I?

13:21.467 --> 13:22.668
Spacely Sprockets.

13:22.734 --> 13:25.271
My office. Which won't be
my office much longer...

13:25.337 --> 13:26.873
- ...if you'd don't...
- Jetson!

13:26.939 --> 13:29.008
It's Mr. Spacely.
You gotta hide.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.242
Chair!

13:30.309 --> 13:31.543
Chair?

13:34.847 --> 13:36.348
What are you doing back?

13:36.415 --> 13:37.583
Oh, job's done.

13:37.649 --> 13:38.885
So soon?

13:38.951 --> 13:40.719
Any surprises?

13:40.786 --> 13:41.888
Nope. No surprises.

13:41.954 --> 13:43.555
No surprises?

13:43.622 --> 13:45.157
Wow, Jetson.

13:45.224 --> 13:48.494
I should have given you a
fake promotion months ago.

13:49.695 --> 13:51.263
What's that noise?

13:51.330 --> 13:54.466
Oh, that's just Pickenpock
in accounting.

13:54.533 --> 13:55.601
Little game we play.

13:59.138 --> 14:01.540
Well, tell him to stop it.

14:01.607 --> 14:02.774
It's annoying.

14:02.841 --> 14:05.777
You got it, Mr. Spacely. Phew.

14:07.413 --> 14:09.148
You better tell me what's going on...

14:09.215 --> 14:11.150
...before I snap you in half!

14:11.217 --> 14:12.985
No snapping necessary.

14:13.052 --> 14:14.786
Last thing I remember,

14:14.853 --> 14:16.188
I was on an airplane.

14:16.255 --> 14:17.656
If you could just set me down.

14:17.723 --> 14:18.891
Flying out of Denver...

14:18.958 --> 14:20.226
...in a snow storm.

14:20.292 --> 14:21.593
Over there would be great.
On the ground.

14:21.660 --> 14:24.630
And then I was standing
in a puddle of water.

14:24.696 --> 14:26.398
With your hand over my mouth.

14:26.465 --> 14:29.801
So I'm gonna ask you one last time.

14:29.868 --> 14:31.170
Where am I?

14:31.237 --> 14:33.272
Orbit City.

14:40.246 --> 14:43.849
Am I in the future?

14:43.916 --> 14:45.617
Hiya, George!

14:46.818 --> 14:48.820
But to me it's just now.

14:48.887 --> 14:51.190
But to you, probably, yes.

14:52.992 --> 14:54.193
Jetson!

14:54.260 --> 14:56.162
We got to get you out of here.

15:01.233 --> 15:05.237
Pickenpock in accounting said
you're the one banging on the wall.

15:05.704 --> 15:06.805
Jetson?

15:06.872 --> 15:08.274
He's not even here.

15:09.008 --> 15:11.110
Pickenpock!

15:13.479 --> 15:16.115
Ooh. I am so mad at your father.

15:16.182 --> 15:19.818
Mom, I'm sure Dad has a good reason
for missing the science fair.

15:19.885 --> 15:21.287
He'd better.

15:21.353 --> 15:23.956
Better cool your jets, Mrs. J.

15:24.023 --> 15:25.958
Your heart rate and blood pressure...

15:26.025 --> 15:28.394
...are both elevated
to dangerous levels.

15:28.460 --> 15:31.163
Rosie, it's only going to get
more dangerous in here,

15:31.230 --> 15:32.731
when George arrives.

15:32.798 --> 15:33.832
I'm home!

15:36.969 --> 15:39.238
Uh... Happy Anniversary?

15:39.305 --> 15:41.974
I'll prepare the couch
for you tonight, Mr. J.

15:42.041 --> 15:43.509
Valentine's day?

15:44.643 --> 15:46.545
I'll pack your bags for you, Mr. J.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.514
Please don't let it be your birthday.

15:49.948 --> 15:52.584
How many handles would you
like on your casket, Mr. J?

15:52.651 --> 15:56.155
George, your son won second
place for his project today...

15:56.222 --> 15:57.956
...at the science fair.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.691
Would have been first.

15:59.758 --> 16:01.693
Except that I've never actually
made anything time travel.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.363
Although, Bobby Booster
never made a volcano erupt.

16:04.430 --> 16:06.332
So I'm not sure why
he got the blue ribbon.

16:06.398 --> 16:09.501
Ah, the whole thing's
a popularity contest anyway.

16:09.568 --> 16:11.003
The science fair!

16:11.070 --> 16:13.305
Jane, Elroy, I'm so sorry.

16:13.372 --> 16:15.174
But I got a new assignment at work.

16:15.241 --> 16:16.808
And something big happened.

16:16.875 --> 16:18.177
Huge actually.

16:18.710 --> 16:19.945
Flying cars!

16:21.613 --> 16:23.782
Moving sidewalks.

16:23.849 --> 16:25.484
And jet packs!

16:25.551 --> 16:27.853
Wow! He's huge!

16:27.919 --> 16:29.921
Everybody, this is Big Show.

16:29.988 --> 16:31.790
Big Show, this is my wife Jane...

16:31.857 --> 16:33.159
...and my boy Elroy.

16:33.225 --> 16:34.393
Where's daughter Judy?

16:34.460 --> 16:36.928
Where else?
Cheerleading practice.

16:38.397 --> 16:40.566
Welcome home, George.

16:40.632 --> 16:42.468
Is that a talking dog?

16:44.002 --> 16:45.671
George.

16:45.737 --> 16:47.439
Get this thing off me.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.209
Get your filthy hands off
of Astro, you brute.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.278
Is that a talking robot?

16:55.914 --> 16:57.083
Take it easy, Astro.

16:57.149 --> 16:58.150
George, do something.

17:02.154 --> 17:04.356
You can let him go now, Big Show.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.625
George, see what happens when
you bring your work home.

17:06.692 --> 17:09.528
I can't believe Mr. Saturnson
giving us a history test...

17:09.595 --> 17:12.664
...the day before
the big space ball game.

17:12.731 --> 17:16.202
Super un-cosmic. My head's so
gonna be full of history...

17:16.268 --> 17:18.369
...there won't be room for the cheers.

17:18.436 --> 17:21.039
Oh. When are we ever
gonna need to know...

17:21.040 --> 17:23.974
...21st century history
in real life, anyway?

17:25.511 --> 17:28.146
That does it! Rosie, stop
with the robot kung-fu.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.449
Big Show, please put my dog down.

17:30.516 --> 17:31.783
Now!

17:33.652 --> 17:36.688
Everybody listen. Big Show's
been frozen in ice for 100 years.

17:36.755 --> 17:37.989
100 years?

17:38.056 --> 17:39.458
I found him. Thawed him.

17:39.525 --> 17:41.127
And brought him home for dinner...

17:41.193 --> 17:43.895
...because he's a little freaked out
about being in the future.

17:43.962 --> 17:45.564
How much dinner does it eat?

17:45.631 --> 17:48.467
Gee, Dad.
That does explain everything.

17:48.534 --> 17:51.270
Come on, Big Show. You can
sit next to me at the table.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.672
You have a lovely home.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.308
If that thing makes
a mess on the carpet,

17:56.375 --> 17:58.810
I am not cleaning it up.

17:58.877 --> 18:02.181
Janey, I'm sorry
I missed the science fair.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.949
You don't have to apologize to me.

18:04.015 --> 18:07.018
Really? Because the look you're
giving me makes me think I do.

18:07.085 --> 18:10.088
George, if you want to put
your work before the family,

18:10.156 --> 18:11.257
that's your decision.

18:11.323 --> 18:13.292
Oh, thanks, sweetie.

18:13.359 --> 18:14.893
That's a load off.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.829
So listen. I couldn't just
leave Big Show at the office.

18:17.896 --> 18:20.166
But I promise,
he'll stay just for one night.

18:20.232 --> 18:21.933
Tomorrow I'll figure out
what to do with him.

18:23.569 --> 18:25.437
Really thought he's read
between the lines on that one.

18:25.504 --> 18:27.773
I got the subtext, Mrs. J.

18:27.839 --> 18:29.141
And I'm a robot.

18:34.946 --> 18:36.148
Mmm.

18:58.870 --> 18:59.871
Oh!

19:28.467 --> 19:29.835
Nighty-night.

19:29.901 --> 19:31.203
Sleep tight.

19:31.270 --> 19:32.938
And just remember...

19:33.905 --> 19:36.242
...I got my eye on you.

19:36.308 --> 19:38.644
Gotta...

19:38.710 --> 19:40.512
...get out of here.

19:42.981 --> 19:45.384
Good morning, Orbit City.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.502
It's another beautiful day
in the troposphere.

19:48.254 --> 19:50.389
It's time to get up and get moving.

19:53.024 --> 19:55.327
Shake away those sleepy z's.

19:58.163 --> 19:59.698
Seriously, buddy. You're gonna be late.

19:59.765 --> 20:00.799
Get out of bed!

20:03.869 --> 20:04.936
I'm up! I'm up!

20:06.672 --> 20:08.407
Oh, Judy, sweetheart.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.041
You look exhausted.

20:10.108 --> 20:11.677
Let me make you breakfast.

20:13.379 --> 20:18.884
I was up all night cramming for
my 21st century history exam.

20:18.950 --> 20:20.786
It's gonna be a disaster.

20:20.852 --> 20:22.087
I just know it.

20:22.153 --> 20:24.423
Maybe you should spend
a little more time studying

20:24.490 --> 20:26.492
and a little less time cheerleading.

20:26.558 --> 20:29.027
What? So I can fail at cheerleading too?

20:29.094 --> 20:30.329
So un-cosmic.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.763
Great advice, Mom.

20:31.830 --> 20:33.799
Well, that's what I'm here for.

20:33.865 --> 20:36.368
Good morning, to my two best girls.

20:37.469 --> 20:39.237
No time for breakfast.

20:39.305 --> 20:41.607
Gotta get to work and figure out
this whole Big Show situation.

20:41.673 --> 20:44.142
Where is our sleepy ice man?

20:44.209 --> 20:45.711
Have you seen Elroy?

20:48.013 --> 20:50.716
Hey, Big Show. Rise and shine.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.487
- He's gone!
- Elroy's not in his room.

20:55.554 --> 20:57.088
Where could they be?

20:58.390 --> 21:00.792
My Dad found him in a block of ice.

21:02.994 --> 21:05.364
He's from the 21st century.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.433
Ooh... Ooh... Is he a superhero?

21:07.499 --> 21:09.435
No. He's a... Uh...

21:09.501 --> 21:11.637
What exactly are you?

21:11.703 --> 21:13.204
You wanna know what I am?

21:13.271 --> 21:14.706
I'm the meanest,

21:14.773 --> 21:17.509
baddest warrior ever to enter
the squared circle.

21:17.576 --> 21:19.678
Well, I mean, I was.

21:19.745 --> 21:22.481
Till I got frozen in ice.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.816
That championship belt was so close.

21:24.883 --> 21:25.984
I could taste it.

21:26.051 --> 21:28.219
You're going to taste
a championship belt?

21:30.422 --> 21:32.391
Oh, I wasn't just going to taste it.

21:32.458 --> 21:35.394
I was gonna hold it over
my head and scream...

21:35.461 --> 21:37.663
..."I am the WWE...

21:37.729 --> 21:41.032
...World Heavyweight Champion!"

21:41.099 --> 21:43.602
You're not the Heavyweight Champion.

21:43.669 --> 21:45.604
Reactor Rollins is.

21:46.838 --> 21:49.675
You telling me you got
WWE in the future?

21:49.741 --> 21:51.510
- Of course.
- In fact,

21:51.577 --> 21:54.713
there's a championship match this
afternoon at Orbit City arena.

21:54.780 --> 21:57.383
That title belt is supposed to be mine!

21:57.449 --> 21:59.184
Reactor Rollins...

21:59.250 --> 22:01.119
...you're going down!

22:04.022 --> 22:05.323
But Big Show, wait...

22:07.192 --> 22:08.394
Hey, taxi!

22:11.563 --> 22:13.965
To Orbit City arena.
And step on it.

22:14.032 --> 22:17.369
I am only authorized to drive
the designated speed limit.

22:17.436 --> 22:18.670
Just go!

22:19.505 --> 22:21.339
Big Show, stop!

22:22.207 --> 22:24.175
Elroy, is Big Show with you?

22:24.242 --> 22:25.677
Not anymore.

22:30.582 --> 22:32.884
That will be five billion star bucks.

22:32.951 --> 22:34.753
Not including tip.

22:35.353 --> 22:36.855
Here's your tip.

22:36.922 --> 22:37.989
Uh-oh.

22:40.091 --> 22:41.560
Dumb robot.

22:44.262 --> 22:45.296
Rollins!

22:45.363 --> 22:47.098
Huh?

22:47.165 --> 22:50.101
Attention! Our Superstars
are very busy warming up.

22:50.168 --> 22:53.572
Information. Our event does not
start for another two hours.

22:53.639 --> 22:55.173
I'm not here to watch it.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.508
I'm here to win it.

22:56.575 --> 22:58.877
Observation. You are human.

22:58.944 --> 23:01.312
Humans are not allowed in the ring.

23:01.379 --> 23:03.915
What? I thought this was the WWE.

23:03.982 --> 23:07.419
Affirmation.
World Wrobot Entertainment.

23:07.986 --> 23:09.421
The W is silent.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.056
Robots?

23:14.493 --> 23:16.462
One, two, three.

23:17.929 --> 23:20.966
You are victorious once again,
Reactor Rollins.

23:21.032 --> 23:23.535
It has been a pleasure
grappling with you.

23:23.602 --> 23:26.838
Champ, the pleasure was all mine.

23:26.905 --> 23:27.906
Hey!

23:28.574 --> 23:30.476
You Reactor Rollins?

23:30.542 --> 23:31.743
Affirmative.

23:31.810 --> 23:33.945
You're wearing my championship belt.

23:34.012 --> 23:35.714
But not for long.

23:38.484 --> 23:39.551
Ow!

23:40.886 --> 23:41.887
Uh-oh.

23:43.822 --> 23:45.991
I just wanted to show him
off to all my friends.

23:46.057 --> 23:48.827
It's not every day your Dad
brings home an ice man.

23:48.894 --> 23:50.128
It's okay, son.

23:50.195 --> 23:52.731
I mean, how much trouble
could one fellow get into?

24:00.238 --> 24:03.742
Projection. The boss is not
going to like this.

24:05.076 --> 24:06.444
One, two, three.

24:09.715 --> 24:11.617
I am the Champion!

24:11.683 --> 24:15.120
Actually, this battle was un-sanctioned.

24:15.186 --> 24:17.022
Actually, lick my boot.

24:19.090 --> 24:20.225
Robots!

24:20.291 --> 24:23.394
You're an embarrassment
to sports entertainment.

24:23.461 --> 24:24.796
Where I come from...

24:24.863 --> 24:27.032
...superstars are made of blood,

24:27.098 --> 24:29.367
guts, and glory.

24:29.434 --> 24:30.536
They're warriors.

24:30.602 --> 24:33.739
Forged in the fire of battle.

24:33.805 --> 24:37.075
Not tin cans bashing each other...

24:37.142 --> 24:38.977
...like bumper cars.

24:39.044 --> 24:41.346
Hey, you're not supposed to be in there.

24:41.412 --> 24:42.881
This is robots only.

24:42.948 --> 24:45.684
Confession.
Boss, I tried to stop him.

24:46.384 --> 24:47.753
Mr. McMahon?

24:47.819 --> 24:49.521
What are you doing in the future?

24:49.588 --> 24:51.122
McMoon's the name.

24:51.189 --> 24:52.323
Mr. McMoon.

24:52.390 --> 24:55.093
McMahon was my great,
great, great, great...

24:55.160 --> 24:56.227
Well, you get the idea.

24:58.396 --> 25:00.899
Get that human out of my ring.

25:03.835 --> 25:06.204
Tick tock. Cosmic clock.

25:06.271 --> 25:07.939
Time's run out for you.

25:08.006 --> 25:10.408
Agreed. It is too bad for you

25:10.475 --> 25:12.177
that I am too good.

25:12.243 --> 25:16.281
Step aside, please. I will escort
this large human from the ring.

25:16.347 --> 25:18.283
Come with me, please.

25:18.349 --> 25:19.951
Are you supposed to be me?

25:20.018 --> 25:22.821
And did you just say please, twice?

25:22.888 --> 25:25.156
You asked for It, large human.

25:25.223 --> 25:28.994
Oh, I'm not just large, I'm a giant!

25:34.633 --> 25:37.068
- Jumping Jupiter!
- Annihilation!

25:37.135 --> 25:40.005
The human defeated
our largest Superstar bot.

25:40.071 --> 25:43.875
Such moves do not exist in our database.

25:43.942 --> 25:45.611
We must update our combat program.

25:45.677 --> 25:49.380
No matter.
When Superstars align,

25:49.447 --> 25:52.217
no human can stop us.

25:52.283 --> 25:54.552
This human's gonna teach
you something new.

26:00.826 --> 26:02.527
You think Big Show is okay, Dad?

26:02.594 --> 26:05.230
Oh, I'm sure a fellow that size
could take care of himself.

26:07.766 --> 26:10.068
It's a bolt bath in there.

26:10.902 --> 26:12.638
Tribulation. Indignation.

26:12.704 --> 26:13.872
Mortification!

26:13.939 --> 26:15.406
This is an outrage.

26:15.473 --> 26:18.209
You can't just barge in here
and take over my robots.

26:18.276 --> 26:19.377
I just did.

26:19.444 --> 26:21.179
Verification. He did.

26:21.246 --> 26:24.515
Oh. Hey, Big Show.
What's going on here?

26:24.582 --> 26:27.052
He thinks he's a WWE Superstar, Dad.

26:27.118 --> 26:29.655
But only robots can be Superstars.

26:29.721 --> 26:30.956
Wrong, kid.

26:31.022 --> 26:33.491
Superstars are supposed to be human.

26:33.558 --> 26:35.727
Not radio-controlled hunks of junk.

26:35.794 --> 26:37.062
Ah... Big Show.

26:37.128 --> 26:39.397
Now remember.
This is the future.

26:39.464 --> 26:41.132
Robots do everything here.

26:41.199 --> 26:42.233
Right. What he said.

26:42.300 --> 26:44.670
Information. The police
are on their way.

26:44.736 --> 26:45.937
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

26:46.004 --> 26:47.839
No reason to involve the authorities.

26:47.906 --> 26:49.474
I'm sure we could work this out.

26:51.910 --> 26:54.345
You with all the muscles.
Come quietly.

26:54.412 --> 26:57.482
Or we'll be forced to ask you
to come quietly again.

26:57.548 --> 26:59.284
Great moons of Jupiter!

26:59.350 --> 27:01.019
Look at the size of it.

27:03.254 --> 27:05.056
Big Show, old buddy, old pal...

27:05.123 --> 27:08.026
Please, let's just settle down
and talk this through.

27:08.093 --> 27:10.696
All right. Enough of
this funny business.

27:10.762 --> 27:11.963
You're coming with me.

27:13.464 --> 27:16.668
Oh, you just made the biggest
mistake of your life.

27:23.241 --> 27:25.176
Get him, boys!

27:25.243 --> 27:28.146
I am the WWE World Heavyweight Champion.

27:28.213 --> 27:29.647
You don't get me.

27:29.715 --> 27:31.516
I get you.

27:31.582 --> 27:32.784
Oh, boy.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.823
- Dad?
- Way ahead of you, son.

27:39.390 --> 27:41.359
This is Rolf Rodriguez.

27:41.426 --> 27:43.729
Reporting live from Orbit City arena,

27:43.795 --> 27:45.330
where a riot has broken out...

27:45.396 --> 27:48.533
...between Orbit City security and a...

27:48.599 --> 27:51.369
A very, really, very big person.

27:51.436 --> 27:53.204
That's Big Show!

27:55.473 --> 28:00.145
Here's to another day of no surprises.

28:03.048 --> 28:05.650
I am here with the ring leader
of this hullabaloo.

28:05.717 --> 28:08.019
Goes by the name, Big Show.

28:08.086 --> 28:11.622
Mr. Big Show, I have one question.

28:11.689 --> 28:12.891
Why?

28:12.958 --> 28:14.893
You future people make me sick.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.295
You allow robots to be your champions?

28:17.362 --> 28:20.932
Maybe you need a reminder
of what a real champ can do.

28:20.999 --> 28:22.500
Starting right now.

28:22.567 --> 28:24.903
I'm not just gonna be
the champion of the ring.

28:24.970 --> 28:27.338
I'm gonna be the champion of the world.

28:27.405 --> 28:31.843
And I'm gonna use your
own robots to help me do it.

28:31.910 --> 28:33.979
You've heard it here first, folks.

28:34.045 --> 28:36.614
Big Show is planning
to take over the world.

28:36.681 --> 28:40.518
For immediate reaction, we turn to
Big Show's old buddy and old pal.

28:40.585 --> 28:42.888
What do you have to say about this, sir?

28:44.055 --> 28:45.924
What have I done?

28:49.194 --> 28:51.830
Jetson!

28:53.198 --> 28:55.233
Dad, shouldn't we help stop Big Show?

28:55.300 --> 28:57.702
I mean, this is kind of our fault.

28:57.769 --> 28:59.470
I think the authorities
have it under control.

28:59.537 --> 29:02.507
Meanwhile, I think it's time
for a Jetson family vacation.

29:02.573 --> 29:03.809
On Mars!

29:05.676 --> 29:09.247
Jetson, I expressly
said, "No surprises."

29:09.314 --> 29:11.682
I'm sorry. George Jetson
isn't here right now.

29:11.749 --> 29:13.819
I can see you!

29:13.885 --> 29:15.148
Please leave a message
and he will return...

29:15.149 --> 29:16.321
...your call at his
earliest convenience.

29:16.387 --> 29:18.089
Jetson, you're...

29:18.156 --> 29:20.391
Oops... Lost the connection.

29:20.458 --> 29:23.761
No telling where he was
going with that sentence.

29:26.764 --> 29:28.433
Hey, Janey. Great news!

29:28.499 --> 29:29.835
I decided you were right.

29:29.901 --> 29:31.702
I'm done putting work before our family.

29:31.769 --> 29:33.238
So we're going on vacation.

29:33.304 --> 29:34.806
- Right now.
- Daddy!

29:34.873 --> 29:37.308
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

29:37.375 --> 29:40.445
Your friend Big Show is so cosmic.

29:40.511 --> 29:41.947
My friend? Judy...

29:42.013 --> 29:43.281
Why aren't you at school?

29:43.348 --> 29:44.850
My history class is canceled.

29:44.916 --> 29:46.751
My history test delayed.

29:46.818 --> 29:49.154
The whole school was sent home today
'cause Big Show's gone crazy,

29:49.220 --> 29:51.990
and is running wild in the city.
Woo-hoo!

29:52.057 --> 29:53.791
Only my sister could find a reason...

29:53.859 --> 29:55.293
...to cheer for the apocalypse.

29:56.727 --> 29:58.964
Orbit City News Network
brings you an update...

29:59.030 --> 30:00.798
...on the Big Show Rampage.

30:00.866 --> 30:04.635
- Uh-oh.
- George Rodriguez, live from city hall,

30:04.702 --> 30:07.472
where Big Show and his gang
of wrestling robots...

30:07.538 --> 30:09.740
...have taken over Orbit City.

30:09.807 --> 30:12.410
What did you do?

30:12.477 --> 30:15.280
For further comment,
we go to Mayor Mercury.

30:15.346 --> 30:17.648
You'll never get away with this!

30:17.715 --> 30:19.617
Someone will stop you!

30:19.684 --> 30:21.152
No one can stop me.

30:21.219 --> 30:23.021
The future's full of wimps.

30:23.088 --> 30:25.023
You make an excellent point.

30:26.824 --> 30:28.927
Just as Orbit City fell to me,

30:28.994 --> 30:30.728
so too will the rest of the Earth.

30:30.795 --> 30:34.933
From this point on, you'll
all do whatever I say...

30:35.000 --> 30:38.937
...or you will face my robots!

30:39.004 --> 30:41.439
All hail, Big Show!

30:41.506 --> 30:43.774
All hail, Big Show.

30:43.841 --> 30:46.444
Hail hard, hail often!

30:46.511 --> 30:49.647
Kneel, for the new World
Heavyweight Champion...

30:49.714 --> 30:51.082
...of the world!

30:51.149 --> 30:52.717
That's redundant.

30:52.783 --> 30:55.186
I said kneel!

30:55.253 --> 30:57.322
Ow!

30:57.388 --> 31:00.058
That makes one little falling star.

31:00.125 --> 31:02.460
Who will fall next?

31:05.063 --> 31:09.367
I am the greatest giant of all time!

31:12.570 --> 31:14.940
I hear Mars is beautiful
this time of year.

31:15.006 --> 31:16.741
- Shall we?
- George!

31:16.807 --> 31:18.376
What? How was I supposed to know...

31:18.443 --> 31:20.845
...he was an evil, power-hungry madman
when I thawed him out?

31:20.912 --> 31:22.080
This is not my fault.

31:22.147 --> 31:23.982
Dad's right.
This isn't his fault.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.283
It's not?

31:25.350 --> 31:27.485
If I hadn't taken Big Show to school,

31:27.552 --> 31:30.121
he never would have found out
about Reactor Rollins,

31:30.188 --> 31:32.690
and none of this
would have ever happened.

31:32.757 --> 31:34.592
Elroy, I am shocked!

31:34.659 --> 31:36.361
- George!
- Seriously?

31:36.427 --> 31:38.396
Shocked that you would
think this is your fault.

31:38.463 --> 31:40.531
None of us knew that Big Show
would turn out to be...

31:40.598 --> 31:42.633
...a future-hating,
robot-smashing monster...

31:42.700 --> 31:45.203
...determined to conquer
the world as we know it.

31:45.270 --> 31:46.804
The point is, Elroy,

31:46.871 --> 31:49.840
you tried to befriend him,
when it was clear he was lost.

31:49.907 --> 31:52.910
That makes you a bigger man than him.

31:52.978 --> 31:54.845
Yuck.

31:54.912 --> 31:57.682
Attention citizens of Orbit City.

31:58.316 --> 31:59.417
Oh, my.

31:59.484 --> 32:02.320
He's a handsome bucket of bolts.

32:02.387 --> 32:05.690
By order of world champion Big Show,

32:05.756 --> 32:08.926
everyone is to report
to Time Warp Square...

32:08.994 --> 32:11.596
...for commencement of manual labor.

32:11.662 --> 32:14.665
Manual labor?
Like a man? Doing the labor?

32:14.732 --> 32:18.603
At least there's no such thing
as "Womanual labor."

32:18.669 --> 32:20.138
Right?
Huh?

32:20.205 --> 32:22.773
You're not gonna last a day
in the post-apocalypse.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.942
- Hmph!
- Hmm.

32:25.010 --> 32:27.878
Humans working for robots.

32:27.945 --> 32:29.880
I've always wondered
what that would be like.

32:31.382 --> 32:34.019
Just kidding, you know I love ya.

32:34.085 --> 32:36.687
Ah, don't worry, everybody.

32:36.754 --> 32:39.424
We've worked too hard
to have to work hard.

32:39.490 --> 32:41.259
Move it.

32:41.326 --> 32:44.962
Or you will lose it.
Believe that.

32:48.866 --> 32:50.201
I think the coast is clear.

32:51.836 --> 32:54.672
Exit the apartment, and come with me.

32:54.739 --> 32:56.341
On my way, gorgeous.

32:56.407 --> 32:59.044
Uh, yeah, sure, be right there.

32:59.110 --> 33:00.678
Just have to use the bathroom.

33:00.745 --> 33:03.181
Might take a while.
Had a big lunch.

33:03.248 --> 33:06.317
Follow me. I know exactly
how to handle this.

33:10.655 --> 33:13.591
Exit the apartment, and come with me.

33:16.461 --> 33:20.631
Alas, my prince.
'Twas not meant to be.

33:20.698 --> 33:21.666
What now, Pops?

33:21.732 --> 33:23.468
If there's one thing I know, Elroy,

33:23.534 --> 33:25.536
it's when to flee for our lives!

33:25.603 --> 33:27.172
Mars, here we come!

33:27.238 --> 33:30.608
George Jetson, you turn
this car around right now.

33:30.675 --> 33:33.211
You have to go talk Big Show
out of conquering the world.

33:33.278 --> 33:34.779
- Me?
- You thawed him out.

33:34.845 --> 33:36.914
You're the only one
he might possibly listen to.

33:36.981 --> 33:40.151
Janey, I'm telling you, there's
no one who can stop this guy.

33:40.218 --> 33:43.354
Wait, there is. Or there was.

33:43.421 --> 33:45.022
What are you talking about, Judy?

33:45.090 --> 33:46.557
Don't waste your time, Mom.

33:46.624 --> 33:48.759
Even she doesn't know
what she's talking about. Hey!

33:48.826 --> 33:51.629
We've been studying
the early 21st century...

33:51.696 --> 33:53.098
...in history class.

33:53.164 --> 33:56.834
Back then, humans like Big Show
battled each other all the time.

33:56.901 --> 34:00.305
Are you saying WWE was people?

34:00.371 --> 34:03.007
Huge people, look, Big Show.

34:03.074 --> 34:05.110
And it says this man called Sheamus...

34:05.176 --> 34:06.844
...was his greatest rival.

34:06.911 --> 34:08.079
Too bad we don't have him...

34:08.146 --> 34:10.114
...to help bail your father
out of this mess.

34:10.181 --> 34:11.416
What would you have me do, dear?

34:11.482 --> 34:13.217
Go back in time and ask for his help?

34:13.284 --> 34:15.820
- Actually, Dad...
- I mean, you're talking time-travel.

34:15.886 --> 34:17.155
It's impossible.

34:17.222 --> 34:18.856
Dad, if you'd seen my science project...

34:18.922 --> 34:21.626
Yes, Elroy, I missed the
science fair and I'm sorry.

34:21.692 --> 34:24.262
Why? Did you want to be bored
out of your mind?

34:24.329 --> 34:28.166
My project hypothesized that
utilizing the gravity well...

34:28.233 --> 34:30.235
...of a massive astronomical object...

34:30.301 --> 34:32.370
...could accelerate
a spacecraft fast enough...

34:32.437 --> 34:35.505
...to breach the Tachyon Barrier
of the space-time continuum.

34:37.442 --> 34:40.344
Flying around the moon will
slingshot us back in time.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.880
Oh.

34:42.947 --> 34:44.782
Unauthorized space-car.

34:44.849 --> 34:47.618
You are ordered to land immediately.

34:47.685 --> 34:48.886
My prince.

34:48.953 --> 34:51.621
Couldn't keep away from me,
could ya, handsome?

34:51.688 --> 34:53.424
Hold on, Jetsons!

34:55.926 --> 34:57.395
George!

35:01.031 --> 35:04.169
According to my calculations,
just a little faster, Dad.

35:04.235 --> 35:06.404
I don't need a calculator
to tell me that!

35:06.471 --> 35:09.474
If only I had a time-frame
destination for my equation.

35:09.540 --> 35:12.443
Wow, it says here that Big Show
was scheduled...

35:12.510 --> 35:15.180
...to battle Sheamus
in Albuquerque, New Mexico,

35:15.246 --> 35:16.647
but he never appeared.

35:16.714 --> 35:21.719
He vanished from WWE
exactly 100 years ago today.

35:21.786 --> 35:25.290
- What are the chances?
- Cosmic.

35:25.356 --> 35:26.991
- Elroy, what are you--
- I'm jacking the universal...

35:27.057 --> 35:29.360
...precisional system into
the space-time de-modulator,

35:29.427 --> 35:33.664
reversing polarity, and setting
it for exactly 100 years ago.

35:33.731 --> 35:34.899
Will that work, sweetie?

35:34.965 --> 35:36.667
- In theory.
- We're dead.

35:37.702 --> 35:38.803
We're all dead.

35:38.869 --> 35:40.938
Floor it, Dad.

36:06.297 --> 36:08.199
We're alive!

36:12.737 --> 36:15.940
Welcome to Green-zone Parking,
that'll be 40 bucks.

36:16.006 --> 36:17.475
Welcome to where?

36:17.542 --> 36:20.278
The time-stamp on local
internet channels confirms it.

36:20.345 --> 36:23.548
We just traveled 100 years
into the past.

36:23.614 --> 36:26.384
- Into the when?
- It worked! It worked!

36:26.451 --> 36:28.118
Eat that, Bobby Booster!

36:28.185 --> 36:29.987
My time travel theory worked.

36:30.054 --> 36:31.822
But how?

36:31.889 --> 36:33.791
Are we on the surface...

36:33.858 --> 36:34.925
...of the Earth?

36:34.992 --> 36:38.796
Of the parking lot.
40 bucks, please.

36:38.863 --> 36:41.131
Look, that sign!

36:41.198 --> 36:43.501
We're at some kind of WWE event!

36:43.568 --> 36:46.337
Then this is where
we'll find more big people.

36:46.404 --> 36:48.873
People who can stop Big Show.

36:48.939 --> 36:50.941
Well, all right, Jetsons.

36:51.008 --> 36:54.245
Maybe we have a shot at
saving Orbit City, after all.

36:54.312 --> 36:57.014
Thanks to my boy, Elroy,
and daughter, Judy.

36:57.081 --> 36:58.649
I'm very proud of you kids.

36:58.716 --> 37:02.186
- Thanks, Dad.
- 40 bucks!

37:02.253 --> 37:04.221
Rosie, you stay here with the car...

37:04.289 --> 37:05.756
...and give this man what he needs.

37:06.824 --> 37:08.659
Oh, sure, Mr. J.

37:08.726 --> 37:12.563
I traveled back 100 years
just so I could watch the car.

37:12.630 --> 37:16.401
You're a... a talking robot?

37:16.467 --> 37:20.137
Yeah, I came from the future
to conquer your world.

37:20.204 --> 37:21.772
Boo!

37:21.839 --> 37:24.375
Primitive.

37:24.442 --> 37:27.378
Now let's find some Superstars
that can help us.

37:27.445 --> 37:29.347
And keep an eye out
for more like Big Show...

37:29.414 --> 37:30.515
...that can hurt us.

37:30.581 --> 37:32.717
All, right, Jetsons. Let's go.

37:36.421 --> 37:37.588
Why aren't we moving?

37:37.655 --> 37:39.690
I think the sllidewalk's broken.

37:39.757 --> 37:40.925
Now, hold on.

37:40.991 --> 37:42.427
Maybe it's just turned off.

37:42.493 --> 37:43.994
We just need to find the button.

37:45.095 --> 37:47.164
Slidewalks on, please.

37:47.231 --> 37:49.934
Hello? Are you there?

37:50.000 --> 37:51.436
I'm not sure what's wrong.

37:51.502 --> 37:53.604
I don't think they have slidewalks yet.

37:53.671 --> 37:56.674
Hey, get a load of those
sci-fi costumes.

37:56.741 --> 37:59.610
That convention was last week, nerds.

37:59.677 --> 38:03.414
Well, I think you know what that means.

38:03.481 --> 38:04.982
We're walking.

38:08.953 --> 38:12.222
How much longer before
they invent slidewalks?

38:12.289 --> 38:14.959
All this walking is killing my feet.

38:15.025 --> 38:17.595
Such an archaic society.

38:17.662 --> 38:19.497
How far have we gone?

38:20.365 --> 38:21.899
Car's okay!

38:21.966 --> 38:23.768
George, how will we
get into this show...

38:23.834 --> 38:25.536
...if we don't have any tickets?

38:25.603 --> 38:29.006
Oh, not to worry, Janey,
we'll sneak in the back door.

38:29.073 --> 38:31.709
Just like that theater I took
you to on our first date.

38:31.776 --> 38:34.144
Oh, like you had to remind me.

38:34.211 --> 38:35.880
Hey, look over there.

38:51.295 --> 38:52.597
Hmm.

38:52.663 --> 38:55.065
Oh, that's Alicia Fox.

38:55.132 --> 38:56.801
She's a Superstar.

38:56.867 --> 38:59.504
That must be where all the
Superstars enter the building.

38:59.570 --> 39:03.207
Ooh, chilly out here.
Don't catch a cold, big guy.

39:03.273 --> 39:06.444
No, ma'am.
Thank you, Miss Fox.

39:06.511 --> 39:09.880
Wow, they make Superstars
that look like her?

39:09.947 --> 39:11.215
George!

39:11.281 --> 39:13.718
What I mean to say is,
we just need to look like her.

39:13.784 --> 39:15.953
And then we can get in that door.

39:42.279 --> 39:46.016
Becky Lynch, Charlotte, Reigns,

39:46.083 --> 39:47.852
Kane. Hey, hey, hey.

39:47.918 --> 39:50.455
You're no Superstar.
Who are you?

39:50.521 --> 39:52.523
I'm... Future Guy?

39:52.590 --> 39:54.024
Uh, yeah.

39:54.091 --> 39:58.062
We're escorting this hot
new Superstar to the ring.

39:58.128 --> 40:00.030
By order of Mr. McMahon.

40:00.097 --> 40:03.400
Mr. McMahon?
Oh, yes, ma'am, Miss Lynch.

40:03.468 --> 40:04.835
Come right in.

40:04.902 --> 40:06.203
Thanks, big guy.

40:06.270 --> 40:08.939
Oh, anytime, Miss Charlotte.

40:09.006 --> 40:13.511
She has always been
my favorite Superstar.

40:13.578 --> 40:15.880
Are we backstage?

40:15.946 --> 40:18.315
Well, it's so dark in here,
I can't tell.

40:18.382 --> 40:21.919
Didn't they have interior
lighting 100 years ago?

40:21.986 --> 40:23.588
Ladies and gentlemen.

40:23.654 --> 40:26.390
Welcome to WWE.

40:32.296 --> 40:34.364
Yeah!

40:34.431 --> 40:37.101
- Yeah!
- Yeah, awesome! Yeah.

40:38.869 --> 40:40.237
Whoa.

40:40.304 --> 40:42.507
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

40:42.573 --> 40:44.642
* Fight the fight
Give it all you got *

40:44.709 --> 40:47.645
* With a hero's heart *

40:47.712 --> 40:49.780
* Don't give up
Give it all you got *

40:49.847 --> 40:52.717
* With a hero's heart
Oh, oh, oh *

41:00.691 --> 41:03.561
* Got a hero's heart *

41:03.628 --> 41:06.263
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

41:06.330 --> 41:08.799
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh *

41:14.004 --> 41:16.574
* Fight the fight
Give it all you got *

41:16.641 --> 41:19.810
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh *

41:23.648 --> 41:26.450
Got to admit, Big Show was right.

41:26.517 --> 41:29.887
Robots just don't do WWE justice.

41:29.954 --> 41:34.625
I had no idea humans
could be so... So physical.

41:34.692 --> 41:38.395
This is the most awesome thing
I've ever seen!

41:38.462 --> 41:40.464
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars,

41:40.531 --> 41:43.067
WWE's got Superstars.

41:43.133 --> 41:44.635
Yay!

41:56.513 --> 42:00.885
Faugh a ballagh!

42:04.121 --> 42:06.557
There he is, Dad!
It's Sheamus!

42:06.624 --> 42:08.993
Wow, he sure looks like a champion.

42:09.059 --> 42:12.262
A little on the pale side, but yeah.

42:12.329 --> 42:13.764
Oh, we are lined up...

42:13.831 --> 42:15.900
...for an exciting match
here tonight, folks.

42:15.966 --> 42:18.936
With the number one contender, Big Show,

42:19.003 --> 42:21.739
still missing in action,
we have a new contender...

42:21.806 --> 42:25.042
...for the WWE World
Heavyweight Championship.

42:25.109 --> 42:29.580
Seth Rollins, the self-proclaimed
future of WWE...

42:29.647 --> 42:32.182
...has stepped up
to prove he's just that.

42:32.249 --> 42:35.986
Still white as a ghost,
huh, Sheamus? Good.

42:36.053 --> 42:38.022
'Cause a ghost is all you're gonna be...

42:38.088 --> 42:40.758
...after I take that title
away from you.

42:40.825 --> 42:43.694
Am I right, everybody?

42:47.131 --> 42:49.834
Uh-oh, that Seth guy looks dangerous.

42:49.900 --> 42:53.103
If he manages to hurt Sheamus,
we'll lose our champ.

42:56.674 --> 42:58.976
Oh, my arm.

42:59.043 --> 43:01.211
It looks like the champ is
getting the upper hand...

43:01.278 --> 43:05.082
...early in this match.

43:05.149 --> 43:07.652
- Sucker!
- Huh?

43:09.319 --> 43:11.722
Oh, but it was all
a devious plan by Rollins...

43:11.789 --> 43:14.625
...to lure Sheamus in
for a sucker-punch.

43:14.692 --> 43:17.527
That's why they call him
The Architect, folks.

43:17.594 --> 43:19.363
We have to get him out of there.

43:19.429 --> 43:22.366
Is there a button to stop the wrestling?

43:22.432 --> 43:23.968
No, Janey, no buttons.

43:24.034 --> 43:27.004
I'm just gonna have to go
talk to Sheamus.

43:27.071 --> 43:28.739
- Ow!
- George!

43:28.806 --> 43:32.276
Fine, I'm fine.
Talking to Sheamus now.

43:32.342 --> 43:34.979
Let's go, Sheamus!

43:35.045 --> 43:37.347
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Sheamus.

43:37.414 --> 43:38.683
Can I have a word with you?

43:38.749 --> 43:41.652
Hey, you, get away from my title belt!

43:42.086 --> 43:43.087
Ha!

43:48.659 --> 43:49.960
This is unbelievable.

43:50.027 --> 43:52.797
A costumed fan jumped the barrier...

43:52.863 --> 43:55.265
...and is distracting
Sheamus at ringside.

43:55.332 --> 43:57.768
He must be working for Seth Rollins.

43:57.835 --> 44:00.337
No, no, no, no,
I'm trying to save the future.

44:00.404 --> 44:01.906
I need the champ.

44:01.972 --> 44:03.473
This guy's lost it.

44:03.540 --> 44:07.577
He's actually stealing the WWE
World Heavyweight title.

44:07.644 --> 44:10.915
- Boo! That's not yours!
- Hands off!

44:10.981 --> 44:13.283
You're gonna need two caskets, fella.

44:13.350 --> 44:15.319
'Cause I'm gonna break you in half.

44:15.385 --> 44:16.687
Ha!

44:20.590 --> 44:22.126
Oh, thank heavens.

44:22.192 --> 44:24.594
The Uso Brothers and Alicia Fox...

44:24.661 --> 44:26.196
...are all headed to ringside...

44:26.263 --> 44:29.199
...to take down this Superstar impostor.

44:29.266 --> 44:30.334
Uh-oh.

44:30.400 --> 44:32.269
It's absolute pandemonium here tonight.

44:32.336 --> 44:35.139
Mayhem inside the ring, chaos outside.

44:35.205 --> 44:37.174
I've never seen anything like it.

44:37.241 --> 44:39.744
Did Sheamus say he'd help us, dear?

44:39.810 --> 44:42.179
I think Dad's recruiting
more help for us.

44:42.246 --> 44:43.447
Way to go, Pops!

44:43.513 --> 44:47.484
The trouble just doubled.
Roman Reigns is here!

44:47.551 --> 44:49.486
Mr. Sheamus! Mr. Sheamus!

44:49.553 --> 44:51.055
Let's cut him off.

44:51.121 --> 44:54.224
Nobody escapes my lucky Cloverleaf hold.

44:55.692 --> 44:56.894
Mr. Sheamus, sorry.

44:56.961 --> 44:58.829
We kinda need your help
to save the future.

44:58.896 --> 45:00.464
Get him!

45:00.530 --> 45:03.734
Unbelievable. The ring has
erupted in absolute chaos!

45:03.801 --> 45:06.503
The ref has been tossed out of the ring.

45:06.570 --> 45:08.305
It's total anarchy!

45:08.372 --> 45:09.573
It's a schmuz!

45:09.639 --> 45:11.742
And it's about to get schmuzzier!

45:11.809 --> 45:13.343
WWE security is here.

45:13.410 --> 45:16.280
But what can he do
to contain this madness?

45:16.346 --> 45:18.215
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

45:18.282 --> 45:20.785
Just when you thought
it couldn't get crazier...

45:20.851 --> 45:23.653
It got crazier!

45:32.329 --> 45:34.799
One, two, three!

45:37.134 --> 45:38.803
- George!
- Way to go!

45:38.869 --> 45:41.071
You did it, Pops!

45:41.138 --> 45:42.672
By me sainted mother.

45:42.739 --> 45:44.074
Who is that guy?

45:46.911 --> 45:48.946
- Huh?
- Oh, George!

45:49.013 --> 45:50.680
- Yay!
- We love you!

45:50.747 --> 45:51.949
Way to go!

45:53.550 --> 45:57.287
And the winner is, uh,
what's your name, buddy?

45:57.354 --> 45:59.556
Future Guy!

45:59.623 --> 46:01.425
Future Guy!

46:01.491 --> 46:02.827
Future Guy?

46:04.528 --> 46:07.764
Future Guy?
Hey, he can't have that name.

46:07.832 --> 46:10.700
I'm the undisputed future of WWE.

46:10.767 --> 46:12.069
* No chance *

46:12.136 --> 46:13.337
* So that's what you all got? *

46:16.006 --> 46:18.642
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the boss!

46:18.708 --> 46:21.111
Mr. McMahon is here!

46:21.178 --> 46:22.612
Uh-oh.

46:22.679 --> 46:23.981
What's this all about?

46:24.048 --> 46:26.316
I've never even heard
of this Future Guy.

46:26.383 --> 46:28.252
You got style, though,
I'll give you that.

46:28.318 --> 46:30.921
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to ruin your show.

46:30.988 --> 46:33.290
I was as surprised as you were.

46:33.357 --> 46:35.725
I don't like surprises, Future Guy.

46:35.792 --> 46:38.462
You're fired!

46:38.528 --> 46:40.164
Boy, that sounds familiar.

46:40.230 --> 46:42.166
No, no, please.

46:42.232 --> 46:44.534
It's Big Show.
He's going crazy.

46:44.601 --> 46:46.503
He came to our city and took it over,

46:46.570 --> 46:47.905
and proclaimed himself to be

46:47.972 --> 46:49.539
the World Heavyweight Champion
of the world!

46:49.606 --> 46:51.008
That's redundant.

46:51.075 --> 46:53.911
Wait, take him to my office.

46:56.013 --> 46:57.414
Now let me get this straight.

46:57.481 --> 47:01.018
You found Big Show
frozen in ice, in the future?

47:01.085 --> 47:02.752
- Yes.
- You thawed him out,

47:02.819 --> 47:04.588
- and he took over your city.
- Yes.

47:04.654 --> 47:06.023
And you've come back in time...

47:06.090 --> 47:07.624
...to take my Superstars
to the future...

47:07.691 --> 47:10.827
...to save... What was it?
Onion Town?

47:10.895 --> 47:12.963
Orbit City, and yes.

47:13.030 --> 47:15.399
This is the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

47:15.465 --> 47:16.533
I believe that.

47:17.801 --> 47:19.436
We found Future Guy's friends...

47:19.503 --> 47:21.505
...hiding out by the souvenir stand.

47:21.571 --> 47:23.507
Get your hands off me.

47:23.573 --> 47:25.642
Uh, did that dog just talk?

47:25.709 --> 47:27.011
I take it back.

47:27.077 --> 47:28.979
That is the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

47:29.046 --> 47:32.349
Would you believe this isn't the
first time I've met a talking dog?

47:32.416 --> 47:34.919
Okay, Future Guy.

47:34.985 --> 47:37.254
First, stop using "Future Guy"

47:37.321 --> 47:41.391
because everyone knows
I'm the future of WWE,

47:41.458 --> 47:42.492
not you.

47:42.559 --> 47:45.329
Second, if you're really
from the future,

47:45.395 --> 47:48.198
why don't you show us your flying car?

47:48.265 --> 47:50.935
Or your pet robot?

47:51.001 --> 47:52.302
Oh, great idea.

47:52.369 --> 47:54.104
They're both
in the parking lot right now.

47:54.171 --> 47:55.705
They'll prove I'm telling the truth.

47:55.772 --> 47:58.775
But don't call Rosie a pet.
She might be a robot,

47:58.842 --> 48:00.677
but she hates being called names.

48:00.744 --> 48:02.512
And she knows robot kung fu.

48:04.214 --> 48:07.517
Boss, you're not really
considering this, are you?

48:07.584 --> 48:09.486
Hmm. I think I need to see...

48:09.553 --> 48:11.989
...this robot and spaceship
you speak of.

48:14.891 --> 48:16.693
So, here they are.

48:16.760 --> 48:17.962
A spaceship.

48:18.028 --> 48:20.397
A pet robot. Ah!

48:20.464 --> 48:21.898
Watch your mouth.

48:21.966 --> 48:23.900
And the rest of you
can shut your pie-holes...

48:23.968 --> 48:25.769
...before you start catching flies.

48:25.835 --> 48:29.773
Mr. J? I repaired the car
while you were away.

48:29.839 --> 48:31.441
She's ready to fly.

48:31.508 --> 48:33.443
Well, Mr. McMahon?
Do you believe us now?

48:33.510 --> 48:35.980
If Big Show really
has taken over the future,

48:36.046 --> 48:38.082
and the Superstars of WWE

48:38.148 --> 48:40.150
are the only ones who can stop him,

48:40.217 --> 48:42.786
then, by gosh, we have to stop him.

48:42.852 --> 48:45.789
And I really wanna go
for a ride in that spaceship.

48:45.855 --> 48:49.559
To the future! Yes!

48:49.626 --> 48:53.130
Bring me to Big Show,
and I'll bring the fight.

48:53.197 --> 48:55.799
Shotgun!

48:55.865 --> 48:58.302
As the undisputed future of WWE,

48:58.368 --> 49:02.939
it's only fitting that I
see my future, that I...

49:03.007 --> 49:05.309
Thank you, Rollins. Sheamus?

49:05.375 --> 49:06.910
Me versus Big Show in a match...

49:06.977 --> 49:08.678
...to decide the future of the Earth.

49:11.015 --> 49:13.783
You can count me in, fella.

49:13.850 --> 49:15.119
George, you did it!

49:15.185 --> 49:17.287
You got them all to come with us.

49:17.354 --> 49:20.524
Yeah, but we aren't all
gonna fit in your UFO.

49:20.590 --> 49:23.293
You got another spaceship
parked around here?

49:23.360 --> 49:26.563
I've got something
you're gonna like better.

49:37.241 --> 49:38.708
* Meet George Jetson *

49:42.746 --> 49:45.049
* Mr. McMahon and Sheamus *

49:48.985 --> 49:51.321
* Seth Rollins and the Usos *

49:54.658 --> 49:57.094
* Alicia Fox and Roman Reigns *

50:09.739 --> 50:11.075
- Yahoo!
- Yeah!

50:33.597 --> 50:37.967
Superstars in outer space.
Fantastic.

50:38.034 --> 50:39.303
Oh, man.

50:39.369 --> 50:41.105
I cannot believe we are in space.

50:41.171 --> 50:42.906
I can't believe we're in the future.

50:42.972 --> 50:46.776
I can't believe you're all going
to finally witness the future...

50:46.843 --> 50:50.114
...of my glorious WWE legacy.

50:50.180 --> 50:52.282
Nobody believes that.

50:52.349 --> 50:55.552
And you can believe that.

50:55.619 --> 50:58.422
Why I... Ow!

50:58.488 --> 51:01.725
Maybe try not standing up
in the space-car.

51:01.791 --> 51:03.760
Everyone, welcome to...

51:06.130 --> 51:07.331
The future?

51:13.337 --> 51:16.740
Oh, George.
He's brutalized our city!

51:16.806 --> 51:19.143
But how did he brutify it so fast?

51:19.209 --> 51:21.811
Oops. Looks like I miscalculated.

51:21.878 --> 51:23.213
We're back in the future,

51:23.280 --> 51:25.149
but about one month after we left.

51:25.215 --> 51:28.552
Look what he did to my school!

51:29.353 --> 51:31.621
Big Show did all this?

51:31.688 --> 51:35.125
This is what happens when you
let Big Show do the decorating.

51:35.192 --> 51:37.327
First, we take down Big Show.

51:37.394 --> 51:40.530
Then we take down the decorations.

51:40.597 --> 51:42.866
Oh, can I take down his little statues?

51:42.932 --> 51:46.403
Sure, but who's gonna
take down the big statue?

51:56.246 --> 51:57.481
Golly, Dad.

51:57.547 --> 52:00.184
I didn't think Big Show
could get any bigger.

52:00.250 --> 52:01.385
Oh, no.

52:01.451 --> 52:03.853
Big Show's Superstar bots.

52:03.920 --> 52:06.022
Is that supposed to be me?

52:06.089 --> 52:10.227
'Cause uh-uh, that tin can ain't
got nothing on Miss Foxy.

52:10.294 --> 52:12.862
An Alicia bot?

52:13.930 --> 52:16.166
Uso bots?

52:16.233 --> 52:18.935
And I thought the originals looked lame.

52:19.002 --> 52:20.604
Hey!

52:20.670 --> 52:23.273
In your case, the bot is an improvement.

52:23.340 --> 52:26.075
Prepare to be processed
for manual labor.

52:26.142 --> 52:28.345
Manual labor?

52:28.412 --> 52:31.748
I got your process right here,
you trash can.

52:33.317 --> 52:35.084
Prepare to be scanned.

52:35.151 --> 52:36.953
Oh, me first, handsome.

52:43.660 --> 52:45.695
Sorry to disturb your meditation,

52:45.762 --> 52:46.896
your world championess,

52:46.963 --> 52:48.665
but there's something you should see.

52:52.802 --> 52:54.838
The Jetsons.

52:54.904 --> 52:58.174
Correct, the only humans
to escape your supreme rule,

52:58.242 --> 52:59.676
thereby undermining your dominance,

52:59.743 --> 53:02.045
and making you look like a space clown.

53:03.613 --> 53:06.283
Catch them and put them
in the Big Show City jail...

53:06.350 --> 53:07.951
...with the other troublemakers.

53:08.017 --> 53:11.154
Prepare for transport
to Big Show City jail.

53:11.221 --> 53:12.689
Oh, boy. Hold on, gang.

53:17.594 --> 53:19.128
Why doesn't this thing have a button...

53:19.195 --> 53:21.298
...for escaping deadly robots?

53:23.367 --> 53:26.102
Deploy Big Show upgrades.

53:26.169 --> 53:28.272
Fire at will.

53:28.338 --> 53:29.773
- Dad?
- I'm on it.

53:32.208 --> 53:34.611
- Dad!
- All under control.

53:40.684 --> 53:41.985
George!

53:42.051 --> 53:45.054
I drive a lot better when
people aren't yelling at me!

53:53.963 --> 53:57.033
Dad, we can't outrun them forever.

53:57.100 --> 53:58.702
This is getting out of control.

53:58.768 --> 54:00.570
How are we gonna
get you guys to Big Show...

54:00.637 --> 54:02.038
...so you can defeat him?

54:02.105 --> 54:03.440
We're never going to get close to him...

54:03.507 --> 54:05.575
...with all those Superstar
bots out there.

54:05.642 --> 54:06.876
We don't need to get close to him.

54:06.943 --> 54:09.513
I just need a way of calling him out.

54:09.579 --> 54:12.081
- Calling him out?
- Challenging him.

54:12.148 --> 54:14.918
Big Show never backs down
from a challenge.

54:14.984 --> 54:16.886
The bigger and louder you make it...

54:16.953 --> 54:19.323
The more it'll drive Big Show crazy.

54:19.389 --> 54:21.925
And then Big Show will come to us.

54:23.660 --> 54:25.862
What if we can get you on television?

54:25.929 --> 54:29.098
The Orbit City News Network
station is nearby.

54:29.165 --> 54:30.700
Great idea, Mom.

54:30.767 --> 54:34.304
Yeah, that network reaches
every TV screen on the planet.

54:34.371 --> 54:37.441
Uh, wonderful plan...

54:37.507 --> 54:39.008
...that will never happen...

54:39.075 --> 54:42.946
...if we're already blasted out
of existence by killer robots.

54:43.012 --> 54:44.147
Seth's right.

54:44.213 --> 54:45.749
Jane, if your plan is gonna work,

54:45.815 --> 54:48.385
I'm gonna need to get
these bots off our tail.

54:48.452 --> 54:50.354
What are you going to do, George?

54:50.420 --> 54:53.256
- I'm switching to manual.
- Oh!

55:02.432 --> 55:04.634
Everybody get ready to follow my lead!

55:14.143 --> 55:15.545
Way to go, Pops!

55:17.381 --> 55:19.683
Eat dust, you rust buckets!

55:22.586 --> 55:25.889
Do it again, George!

55:28.558 --> 55:31.561
I've got him. I've got him.

55:32.829 --> 55:35.131
- You missed him.
- You missed him.

55:35.198 --> 55:36.666
Argh!

55:41.771 --> 55:44.107
- Faugh a ballagh!
- Get me out of here.

55:44.173 --> 55:45.575
Move, move, move!

55:45.642 --> 55:48.277
False alarm, everybody. Woo.

55:48.344 --> 55:51.047
I feel much better now that I'm
out of that space capsule.

55:51.114 --> 55:52.115
George!

55:58.622 --> 56:01.625
Huh... I hope Dad is going to be okay.

56:01.691 --> 56:02.992
Don't you worry, lad.

56:03.059 --> 56:05.228
Your pa looks to be
a very brave warrior.

56:05.294 --> 56:08.832
And if there's one thing your father
knows about getting into trouble,

56:08.898 --> 56:11.067
it's how to sneak his way out of it.

56:11.134 --> 56:14.303
Well, that may be true, but since
you all have Big Show covered,

56:14.370 --> 56:18.542
I want to make sure
our friend George is covered.

56:18.608 --> 56:20.645
Then you're going to need a guide for...

56:20.647 --> 56:23.013
...the future so you
don't get lost or dead.

56:25.214 --> 56:26.983
Come on, Mr. M.

56:27.050 --> 56:30.654
Robot motorcycle.
Now we're talking!

56:35.258 --> 56:36.726
Hang in there, Roy boy.

56:36.793 --> 56:38.595
We'll bring your dad back.

56:38.662 --> 56:40.396
Let's save George.

56:40.464 --> 56:42.432
You said it, Astro.

56:46.770 --> 56:49.873
Can't catch me, lame bots.

56:49.939 --> 56:53.843
We are not lame.
It is you who is lame.

56:57.681 --> 57:00.316
Miss Foxy bot is going to get you.

57:00.383 --> 57:03.152
Foxy bot! Foxy bot!

57:11.294 --> 57:15.499
The path to your surrender
is written in the stars.

57:15.565 --> 57:18.902
You cannot.
You will not escape.

57:18.968 --> 57:21.971
Give up or you will face
the wrath of Big Show.

57:22.038 --> 57:24.508
Trust me, you don't want none of that.

57:24.574 --> 57:27.043
Okay, I surrender.

57:28.778 --> 57:31.247
Nighty nightmares.

57:31.314 --> 57:33.650
Ha ha ha ha.

57:37.253 --> 57:39.656
Another puny human falls to Big Show...

57:39.723 --> 57:43.259
...world champion of the world.
Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha.

57:43.326 --> 57:46.530
Boy, I hope this works.

57:46.596 --> 57:49.533
Okay, everybody. Let's go.

57:51.300 --> 57:53.069
Ya-hoo!

57:53.136 --> 57:56.105
And on the lighter side,
look at this puppy!

57:57.607 --> 57:58.675
It almost makes you forget...

57:58.742 --> 58:01.077
...that we're all enslaved by a madman.

58:04.748 --> 58:06.750
Hey! You cannot be in here.

58:06.816 --> 58:09.886
Excuse us, Rolf.
We've got breaking news.

58:09.953 --> 58:13.289
- But you can't...
- Emphasis on the breaking.

58:14.490 --> 58:16.425
Well, when you put it that way.

58:16.492 --> 58:20.530
We interrupt this puppy
to bring you a special report.

58:20.597 --> 58:22.465
Ready for your close up, Sheamus.

58:22.532 --> 58:25.301
Time to call out Big Show.

58:25.368 --> 58:26.703
Big Show!

58:26.770 --> 58:29.172
I've come a long way to find you, fella.

58:29.238 --> 58:31.140
Sheamus? He's here?

58:31.207 --> 58:33.743
Imagine my surprise when I
found out you've been hiding...

58:33.810 --> 58:35.679
...in a glacier for 100 years...

58:35.745 --> 58:37.581
...all because you were too chicken...

58:37.647 --> 58:39.182
...to step in the ring with me.

58:39.248 --> 58:41.718
So, now you've taken over
the future with no Sheamus...

58:41.785 --> 58:43.820
...and declared yourself
the World champ.

58:43.887 --> 58:49.726
Well, surprise, Big Show!
The real champ is here.

58:49.793 --> 58:51.661
And in front of
the millions of people...

58:51.728 --> 58:54.330
...watching this all over the world.

58:54.397 --> 58:55.999
I'm calling you out.

58:56.065 --> 59:00.103
Anytime, anyplace, I will
run you into the ground.

59:00.169 --> 59:02.038
- He can't hear you, sir.
- What?

59:02.105 --> 59:05.541
That's a TV screen, not a video phone.

59:05.609 --> 59:08.978
- Argh!
- Ow.

59:09.913 --> 59:11.881
Looks like we have a caller.

59:11.948 --> 59:14.584
Time Warp Square, 10 minutes!

59:14.651 --> 59:15.885
I'll be there.

59:17.987 --> 59:22.458
- My turn to be on TV.
- Seth.

59:22.525 --> 59:25.662
It is a Rolf Rodriguez's
exclusive, a grudge match.

59:25.729 --> 59:27.697
100 years in the making.

59:27.764 --> 59:30.566
Two humans, battling it out
for total supremacy.

59:30.634 --> 59:34.671
And I will be there, bringing
you every heart-pounding second...

59:34.738 --> 59:39.175
...or my name isn't Rolf Rodriguez!

59:46.716 --> 59:48.584
Feels like I've been in here forever.

59:48.652 --> 59:50.787
- Jetson?
- Mr. Spacely?

59:50.854 --> 59:53.823
Oh, this is just great.

59:53.890 --> 59:56.559
Stuck in a cell with Jetson.

59:56.626 --> 59:58.728
You know, this is all your fault!

59:58.795 --> 01:00:00.496
Yes sir, I'm well aware.

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:04.000
But don't worry. I've got a
plan to take Big Show down.

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:06.803
- You see my family was...
- You sent your family...

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.872
...to deal with that madman?

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:11.274
Huh, classic Jetson.

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:13.076
Big Show will destroy them.

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:17.280
If I was your family, I'd
fire you so hard right now.

01:00:17.346 --> 01:00:18.748
But they have help.

01:00:18.815 --> 01:00:22.485
Went back in time and
found real WWE Superstars...

01:00:22.551 --> 01:00:24.320
...that know how to stop Big Show.

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:27.691
It doesn't matter.
Big Show is too powerful.

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:30.226
He has all my Superstar bots
under control.

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:33.096
As well as his new destruction bots.

01:00:33.162 --> 01:00:36.165
If anyone tries to stop him,
they'll fail.

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:41.037
Time for a cosmic awakening.

01:00:41.104 --> 01:00:43.807
It is written in the stars.

01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:45.574
We will hit hard.

01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:47.343
And hit often.

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:48.878
Oh, what's going on?

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:51.180
Everyone is going to Time Warp square.

01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:54.250
World champion Big Show
and his destruction bots...

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:57.687
...are about to spring a trap
on some puny humans...

01:00:57.754 --> 01:01:00.389
...from the past.

01:01:00.456 --> 01:01:02.325
A trap! Oh, no!

01:01:02.391 --> 01:01:03.592
My family is heading into

01:01:03.659 --> 01:01:05.361
a trap and they don't even know it.

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:06.562
We need to get out of here.

01:01:06.629 --> 01:01:07.797
We need to help them.

01:01:07.864 --> 01:01:10.099
What can we do?
We're just people.

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:12.301
- People can't do anything.
- That's right.

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:14.470
The robots took our buttons away.

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:17.673
You're wrong. Our ancestors
used to do everything.

01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:20.777
They cooked for themselves.
They cleaned for themselves.

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:22.645
They even walked everywhere.

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:28.785
We live in a future so great,
we don't have to do anything.

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:31.087
And if we want to get back
to doing nothing,

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:33.823
today we have to do something.

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:39.462
What can we do?

01:01:39.528 --> 01:01:40.797
We're stuck in this cell.

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:44.333
Another stinker of an idea from Jetson.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.502
Trust me.
I work with this guy.

01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:48.104
He's got a million of them.

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:03.753
Wow! For a second there
I thought he was gonna do it.

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.189
Classic Jetson!

01:02:13.462 --> 01:02:15.431
Huh! I did it!

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:19.936
Don't worry, Mr. J, it'll be our secret.

01:02:20.003 --> 01:02:21.570
Let's get you out of here, George.

01:02:21.637 --> 01:02:22.839
Yeah.

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:25.141
Thanks, Rosie.
Thank, Mr. McMahon.

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:26.776
Hey, fellas!

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:31.414
Who wants to help me save the future?

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.249
Well, technically, it's the present.

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:36.085
Who wants to help me save the present?

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.958
Guess Big Show is right.

01:02:42.025 --> 01:02:44.327
The future really is full of wimps.

01:02:58.007 --> 01:02:59.475
You think he's going to show?

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:02.678
If he doesn't, he'll have to
rename himself No Show.

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:05.849
- No Show!
- Yeah.

01:03:08.417 --> 01:03:09.418
What the devil?

01:03:11.387 --> 01:03:12.421
It's a trap!

01:03:13.857 --> 01:03:15.591
- Hey!
- Let go.

01:03:15.658 --> 01:03:17.760
I just need to call him out.

01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:19.829
He'll come right to us.

01:03:19.896 --> 01:03:21.197
We wouldn't be in this mess...

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:23.732
...if The Architect had
done the planning.

01:03:23.799 --> 01:03:27.136
The Architect better start
planning for a full body cast...

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:29.672
...if he keeps mouthing off.

01:03:29.738 --> 01:03:31.841
I can... I will break you, robot.

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:33.910
You cannot. You will not.

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:35.744
- Can!
- Cannot.

01:03:35.811 --> 01:03:38.147
Will, and you can believe that.

01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:40.416
I will not believe that.

01:03:42.685 --> 01:03:46.655
Sheamus! You came a long way...

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:48.958
...to taste my boot.

01:03:49.025 --> 01:03:52.095
The only thing I'm gonna
be tasting is victory.

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:54.964
Big talk from a little man.

01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:56.832
But to earn your match with me...

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:58.734
...you must first survive...

01:03:58.801 --> 01:04:00.436
...my Undertaker bot.

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:06.375
My Kane bot.

01:04:10.579 --> 01:04:15.351
I call them my Bots of Destruction.

01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:19.355
Excellent plan, Your Excellency.

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:22.191
The Architect could have done better.

01:04:22.258 --> 01:04:24.760
I'm warning you.

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:29.999
Two on one. You can't beat
me alone, huh, fella?

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:31.834
I'm in charge.

01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:33.836
I make the rules.

01:04:33.903 --> 01:04:36.072
Well, I'm here to break your rules...

01:04:36.139 --> 01:04:37.306
...and your bots.

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:41.577
Destruction Bots, destroy Sheamus!

01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:16.946
Let's go, Sheamus!

01:05:17.013 --> 01:05:19.215
- Way to go, Sheamus!
- Go Sheamus, woo-hoo!

01:05:22.518 --> 01:05:24.087
Whoa!

01:05:24.153 --> 01:05:26.389
You are supposed to be in your cell.

01:05:26.455 --> 01:05:29.058
Yeah?
Well, so are we.

01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:32.295
We may be wimps,
but there's a lot of us.

01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:33.462
Uh-oh!

01:05:33.529 --> 01:05:36.032
Yeah, you're in for it now,
sprocket head.

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:38.667
Time to lead a revolution, Future Guy.

01:05:39.702 --> 01:05:41.437
Charge!

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.775
Uh-oh! This is so wrong.

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:48.411
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

01:05:58.954 --> 01:06:00.289
Whoa, there!

01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:03.192
This futuristic billboard
bucks like a bull.

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:14.970
You bots should come to Ireland...

01:06:15.038 --> 01:06:16.939
...and try our famous potatoes.

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:19.675
Let me give you a sample.

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:24.580
One potato, two potato,
three potato, four.

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:28.117
Bring it on, fellas.
There's a whole lot more!

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:32.288
Woo-hoo.

01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:34.257
- Oh, my!
- Yay, you got him.

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:38.027
Oh, please! All the four-leaf clover
in the world...

01:06:38.094 --> 01:06:40.563
...won't bring him the luck
he needs to win.

01:06:40.629 --> 01:06:42.231
Ugh! That does it.

01:06:42.298 --> 01:06:45.601
When I get out of this,
you're so gonna get it.

01:06:52.275 --> 01:06:55.878
They call this guy the Celtic Warrior?

01:06:57.012 --> 01:07:00.049
More like Celtic Bore-ior.

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:03.419
Seriously! This guy is boring
me to death.

01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:08.624
Come on, Sheamus! Tag me in.

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:12.128
Let me show you how
a real champion does it.

01:07:15.564 --> 01:07:18.367
I'll tag you in, you runt!

01:07:26.342 --> 01:07:30.679
Ha! The Architect outsmarts
everyone again.

01:07:30.746 --> 01:07:33.516
Kane bot, destroy Seth Rollins.

01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:42.258
Whoa! Hey!

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:47.763
Oh, I like these odds.
Bring it on.

01:07:52.601 --> 01:07:56.405
You're a strong one,
but you got no soul.

01:07:57.072 --> 01:07:58.374
You got no heart.

01:07:58.441 --> 01:08:01.277
So, let me show you a proper heartbeat.

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:12.221
Now it's my turn to party.

01:08:14.157 --> 01:08:17.160
Whoa! Hey!

01:08:18.461 --> 01:08:19.694
Help!

01:08:20.996 --> 01:08:22.198
Ah!

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:30.639
There can be only one Roman Reigns.

01:08:40.183 --> 01:08:42.785
- Time to get...
- Uso crazy.

01:08:42.850 --> 01:08:45.453
- U!
- So!

01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:51.794
Bots, get Seth Rollins.

01:08:51.859 --> 01:08:52.720
Oh!

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.298
As you command, your World Championess.

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:03.272
Rest in pieces.

01:09:06.774 --> 01:09:09.178
Doesn't matter what century it is.

01:09:09.245 --> 01:09:11.346
I've always been better than you.

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:12.881
I'm not gonna pin you.

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:16.819
I want you to kneel
before your champion.

01:09:16.885 --> 01:09:18.587
Don't do it, Sheamus!

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.956
- Don't give in.
- You can take him.

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:22.625
Give him the what for!

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:26.295
Prepare to silence the Jetsons.

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:27.895
Sheamus bot.

01:09:28.863 --> 01:09:30.299
Don't surrender, Sheamus.

01:09:30.366 --> 01:09:32.734
He's nothing but a great big bully.

01:09:35.002 --> 01:09:36.004
Ah!

01:09:36.071 --> 01:09:37.506
No!

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:40.175
You wouldn't.

01:09:40.243 --> 01:09:41.844
Kneel.

01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.383
Huh?

01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:54.557
And that, as they say,

01:09:54.623 --> 01:09:57.526
- is how you layeth the smacketh down.
- George!

01:09:57.593 --> 01:09:58.594
- Dad!
- Daddy.

01:09:58.661 --> 01:10:00.929
Thank Jupiter you're all okay.

01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:08.271
Okay, everybody.
Time to take back our city.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.182
You're not going anywhere, Big Show.

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:21.950
We want our city back.

01:10:22.017 --> 01:10:25.053
Yeah, this is our home
and don't you forget it.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.990
- Now you're the one in a cage.
- You stink!

01:10:29.758 --> 01:10:33.829
At last, just you and me, fella!

01:10:35.598 --> 01:10:37.733
Saw that coming a mile away.

01:10:39.768 --> 01:10:43.005
But did you see this coming, little bug?

01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:49.778
Windshield bug.
I see what you did there.

01:10:51.246 --> 01:10:53.382
Now you got me Irish up.

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:56.051
- Get him.
- Go Sheamus!

01:10:56.118 --> 01:10:59.688
Help! Anybody.

01:11:07.262 --> 01:11:09.798
Ow! Ow!

01:11:10.399 --> 01:11:12.034
Uh-oh!

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:14.303
Miss Foxy is on fire today.

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:16.572
Yay Alicia! Woo-hoo!

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:22.711
So, you want to see me fly, robot?

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:27.215
I'll show you some flying.

01:11:27.282 --> 01:11:29.918
Superman Punch!

01:11:32.187 --> 01:11:33.722
Never fails.

01:11:36.024 --> 01:11:39.261
Ooh, waa!

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:41.029
Yeah!

01:11:41.096 --> 01:11:43.399
That's what you get
for picking on a kid.

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:46.669
I should have taken
that job as a toaster.

01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:54.309
Uso!

01:12:04.587 --> 01:12:07.923
I saved all of you guys.

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:12.695
And that's why, I am the future of WWE.

01:12:12.761 --> 01:12:16.131
You may all thank me...

01:12:16.198 --> 01:12:17.866
Told you I'd get you.

01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:19.535
And thank you, Seth.

01:12:20.302 --> 01:12:21.537
You're welcome.

01:12:21.604 --> 01:12:23.739
Ballagh!

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:25.408
Hi-ya!

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:28.611
The Celtic warrior falls to no man.

01:12:30.245 --> 01:12:31.647
No beast.

01:12:34.182 --> 01:12:35.551
Nor Big Show.

01:12:41.857 --> 01:12:43.125
Oh.

01:12:47.195 --> 01:12:48.397
Whoa!

01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:52.801
Oh!

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:54.136
Sheamus!

01:12:56.805 --> 01:12:59.374
Looks like you fall to me after all.

01:13:04.246 --> 01:13:06.014
Hang on, Sheamus!

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:15.991
- Going up.
- George!

01:13:16.391 --> 01:13:17.860
Jetson!

01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:25.000
- Here they come.
- Dad's bringing them back.

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:26.469
But it's not over yet.

01:13:26.535 --> 01:13:28.604
Looks like Big Show is winning.

01:13:28.671 --> 01:13:31.574
You will fall.
Everyone falls to me.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:35.010
I am Big Show.
I am the Champion.

01:13:38.847 --> 01:13:40.916
- What?
- What's that, fella?

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:43.752
I can't hear you over my white noise.

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:47.756
- Yay!
- Yay, Sheamus!

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:51.059
- Go! Go!
- Let's go, Sheamus!

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:57.132
Let's go, Sheamus!
Let's go, Sheamus!

01:13:59.968 --> 01:14:01.837
Still can't hear you, friend.

01:14:02.905 --> 01:14:05.674
Try talking into my throw kick.

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:14.583
One, two!

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:20.188
But you had the three count.
You had me beat.

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:22.658
Why?

01:14:22.725 --> 01:14:24.693
Let's go back to our time, fella.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:28.731
Let's battle like true Superstars
in a proper ring.

01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:31.534
Then we'll see once and
for all who deserves to be

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.202
WWE World Heavyweight Champ.

01:14:36.238 --> 01:14:37.773
Okay.

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.975
But we all know it's gonna be me, right?

01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:42.878
Did you see that?
Humans in action.

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:44.479
It was amazing!

01:14:44.547 --> 01:14:46.682
You look ridiculous.
You know that?

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:57.292
That should do it.

01:14:57.359 --> 01:14:59.427
I programmed the car to take
you guys back to the night you left.

01:14:59.494 --> 01:15:00.729
I figured that would cause...

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:02.865
...the least number
of temporal paradoxes.

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:06.334
Ah, listen guys. Thanks so much
for helping us out.

01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:07.836
We really appreciate it.

01:15:07.903 --> 01:15:12.875
Big Show! Don't you have
something you want to say?

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:17.680
George, I owe you and
your family an apology.

01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:19.715
Especially you, Elroy.

01:15:19.782 --> 01:15:22.150
You also owe me a new teddy bear.

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:26.789
Settle for my Bots of Destruction?

01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:32.227
Hmm. Deal.

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:34.730
I owe the rest of you an apology too.

01:15:34.797 --> 01:15:36.431
I don't know if it was being frozen...

01:15:36.498 --> 01:15:38.466
...in ice for 100 years or...

01:15:38.533 --> 01:15:40.869
Beating a robot for
the Championship title.

01:15:40.936 --> 01:15:43.906
But I crossed a line and I'm sorry.

01:15:43.972 --> 01:15:45.608
I hope you can forgive me.

01:15:46.775 --> 01:15:48.543
But you enslaved us!

01:15:48.611 --> 01:15:50.846
And made us build a giant statue.

01:15:50.913 --> 01:15:52.347
Yeah. What about that?

01:15:52.414 --> 01:15:54.449
Who's gonna fix our city?

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:55.751
We should probably get going.

01:15:55.818 --> 01:15:57.019
Right behind you.

01:15:57.753 --> 01:15:59.154
Farewell, Jetsons.

01:16:12.901 --> 01:16:15.971
- Jetson!
- Mr. Spacely. I know.

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:17.172
I should have told you about

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:19.141
Big Show the second I found him.

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:22.510
I understand if you never
want me to work for you again.

01:16:22.577 --> 01:16:24.346
Are you kidding?

01:16:24.412 --> 01:16:27.716
I just got the contract
to rebuild Orbit City.

01:16:27.783 --> 01:16:28.917
I'm gonna need to promote...

01:16:28.984 --> 01:16:30.753
...somebody to supervise the robots...

01:16:30.819 --> 01:16:32.587
...while they do all the work.

01:16:32.655 --> 01:16:34.189
You think you can handle it?

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:38.060
A promotion?
Yes, sir. Mr. Spacely, sir.

01:16:38.126 --> 01:16:41.730
I'm your man but first
I'm gonna need a week off...

01:16:41.797 --> 01:16:43.065
...to spend with my family.

01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:45.567
- I'll give you one day...
- I'll take it.

01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:48.771
Oh, George!
I'm so proud of you.

01:16:48.837 --> 01:16:51.006
Me too!

01:16:52.107 --> 01:16:54.810
Oh, stop.
Okay boy, that's enough.

01:16:54.877 --> 01:16:58.380
Seriously, this is getting kinda gross.

01:16:58.446 --> 01:17:00.916
I sure hope those guys
made it back okay.

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.790
I love these classic matches.

01:17:07.856 --> 01:17:09.457
I could watch them a thousand times.

01:17:09.524 --> 01:17:11.026
And you have.

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:13.896
Good news!
I aced my history test.

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:15.597
My teacher said I knew more...

01:17:15.664 --> 01:17:17.800
...about the 21st century than he did.

01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:19.101
Guys, we gotta get going.

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:20.903
We're gonna be late for WrestleMania.

01:17:20.969 --> 01:17:22.304
Oh, you're right!

01:17:22.370 --> 01:17:24.572
And the World Champion is...

01:17:24.639 --> 01:17:26.241
Everybody in the car.

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:28.376
Hey, wait for me!

01:17:35.851 --> 01:17:38.286
Salutations, Jetsons.

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:40.789
Oh! Short but cute.

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:42.958
Notification. Ha!

01:17:43.025 --> 01:17:45.761
We have your space box
all ready for you.

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:47.162
A space box?

01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:50.298
Appreciation.
It is the least we can do.

01:17:50.365 --> 01:17:54.803
After all, tonight is all
because of the Jetsons.

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:04.847
Ladies and gentlemen,
to honor the brave...

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:07.850
...human Superstars
who saved Orbit City.

01:18:07.916 --> 01:18:09.985
To inspire a new generation...

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:13.521
...to get off their buttons
and reach for the stars,

01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:16.491
WWE will now and forever more...

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:18.761
...be for humans only.

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:24.532
Better them then us.

01:18:24.599 --> 01:18:25.768
Totally agree.

01:18:25.834 --> 01:18:28.036
Please welcome to the ring,

01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:32.440
your new WWE Superstars!

01:18:37.245 --> 01:18:40.382
I got my Superstars right here.

01:18:40.448 --> 01:18:43.218
- Thanks, Dad.
- Aw!
