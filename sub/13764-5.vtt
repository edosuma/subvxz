00:22.226 --> 00:24.203
Oi, referee, are you blind?!

00:27.427 --> 00:30.539
- Right, hold on.
- What do you think I'm doing!

00:33.143 --> 00:35.022
Back of the net!

00:42.598 --> 00:44.927
- Did you see that?
- Definitely offside.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.983
You're nicked, sunbeam.

00:49.860 --> 00:52.307
Chris, take him away,
charge him.

00:55.028 --> 00:56.497
I'll do it.

00:56.614 --> 00:59.159
I'm arresting you for
the theft of a motor vehicle,

00:59.257 --> 01:01.735
resisting arrest,
and driving like a div.

01:01.816 --> 01:04.425
You're not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so,

01:04.503 --> 01:07.714
anything you may say
may be taken in evidence.

01:08.125 --> 01:11.257
Little sod. They should
bring back National Service.

01:11.345 --> 01:13.675
What, take him away,
teach him how to kill people?

01:13.733 --> 01:16.219
Didn't do me any harm.
Teach him some manners.

01:16.706 --> 01:18.280
Oi, referee!

01:18.370 --> 01:21.146
Has anyone ever told you
you need glasses, you dozy git!

01:21.217 --> 01:23.261
Next time,
I'll run you over!

01:23.502 --> 01:24.875
Think you'd better take this.

01:24.965 --> 01:27.591
Plod have found
a body in Trafford Park.

01:29.334 --> 01:30.778
Somebody help us?

01:30.898 --> 01:33.775
Oh, leave him. Weediest kid
always stayed in goal.

01:33.845 --> 01:34.657
Come on!

01:36.797 --> 01:39.614
Chris, you're being a div.
Get in.

01:42.055 --> 01:43.968
<i>My name is Sam Tyler.</i>

01:44.064 --> 01:47.015
<i>I had an accident
and I woke up in 1973.</i>

01:47.131 --> 01:50.624
<i>Am i mad? In a coma?
Or back in time?</i>

01:50.702 --> 01:54.143
<i>Whatever's happened, it's like
I've landed on a different planet.</i>

01:54.220 --> 01:57.635
<i>Now maybe if I can work out
a reason, I can get home.</i>

02:48.648 --> 02:51.545
Get him out of here!
Get out!

02:54.872 --> 02:58.259
Colin Clay, number 8,
Heathfield Road.

02:58.337 --> 03:00.099
I think it was a heart attack.

03:00.177 --> 03:04.092
It must have exploded out his arse,
there's blood all down his back.

03:04.797 --> 03:07.831
What's up with you?
- Got a cold.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.122
Stabbing?

03:10.376 --> 03:12.549
If it was,
I couldn't find a hole.

03:13.078 --> 03:15.662
Well, it was very cold last night.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.344
He may have delayed
rigor mortis.

03:18.481 --> 03:22.533
And I can smell alcohol,
so I'd say... eleven thirty.

03:22.611 --> 03:26.252
- How'd you work that out?
- Chucking out time.

03:28.327 --> 03:29.756
Found this.

03:33.417 --> 03:35.081
United.

03:35.927 --> 03:37.336
Well...

03:37.532 --> 03:41.956
Whoever did it, at least
he had a decent motive.

03:44.364 --> 03:46.185
He's a City fan.

03:46.302 --> 03:49.689
Shall I let his old lady know
she can join the singles club?

03:52.880 --> 03:54.661
No. I'll do it.

04:11.231 --> 04:13.913
- Is your mum in?
- Mum!

04:16.678 --> 04:20.031
I'm a police officer.
Can I have a word?

04:37.572 --> 04:38.736
Ryan?

04:41.003 --> 04:42.757
I'm gonna get off now.

04:46.147 --> 04:48.088
Will you look
after your mum for me?

04:50.401 --> 04:51.596
Promise?

04:58.093 --> 05:00.205
Find out who killed me dad?

05:04.722 --> 05:07.485
- Yes, I will.
- Promise?

05:16.699 --> 05:19.544
Doesn't take much working out,
even for you lot.

05:19.624 --> 05:23.154
Right, let's start by bringing in
all known football hooligans,

05:23.201 --> 05:26.761
get their names and addresses,
find out where they were last night.

05:27.997 --> 05:30.628
- Get Ray to breathe on them.
- I think you're wrong.

05:30.668 --> 05:33.319
This doesn't bear the hallmarks
of a football-related attack.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.250
United are playing City
on Saturday.

05:35.306 --> 05:37.341
Some poor sod always
gets a good kicking.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.883
But that's just it, he didn't.

05:38.970 --> 05:42.554
If this was about football,
he would've had serious injuries.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.669
He's dead,
that's quite serious.

05:44.717 --> 05:46.394
Colin Clay wasn't beaten up.

05:46.497 --> 05:49.931
He didn't have "Georgie Best
is a tosser" written on his forehead.

05:50.012 --> 05:52.683
In fact, nothing I saw this morning
suggested he died

05:52.744 --> 05:54.725
because of which
football team he supported.

05:54.776 --> 05:57.522
That's because
you don't know this city like I do.

05:58.108 --> 06:01.326
I want to talk to his family,
his friends, and his workmates.

06:01.387 --> 06:03.449
I wanna find out
if there was another motive.

06:03.487 --> 06:06.685
You do that, Sherlock, and
if that doesn't work, try the butler.

06:06.735 --> 06:07.974
Maybe <i>he</i> did it.

06:08.083 --> 06:10.143
I'll bang up a hooligan by lunch.

06:21.731 --> 06:23.822
Hello love, DC Skelton.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.833
You didn't see anybody suspicious
on your round?

06:30.861 --> 06:33.278
- What now, boss?
- Let's go back over the statements.

06:33.317 --> 06:36.171
It's essential we take
a methodical approach-

06:37.141 --> 06:40.781
Allow me
to rephrase the question.

06:41.877 --> 06:45.049
Bloody hooligans.
Waste of space.

06:46.680 --> 06:49.335
Had us scratching
our heads for a while.

06:49.756 --> 06:53.356
His clothes were covered in blood
but only on the back.

06:53.935 --> 06:56.590
If it wasn't for that,
we'd never have found it.

06:56.820 --> 06:57.830
Found what?

06:58.442 --> 06:59.412
There.

06:59.944 --> 07:02.424
Just above the hairline.
Puncture wound.

07:02.485 --> 07:04.862
We'll have to go in and have
a proper look, but my guess,

07:04.929 --> 07:06.645
it punctured the cerebellum.

07:07.559 --> 07:08.568
Knife?

07:09.458 --> 07:10.524
Too small.

07:12.069 --> 07:12.872
What then?

07:13.372 --> 07:15.391
Your guess is as good as mine.

07:15.709 --> 07:18.857
All I can tell you is, it was
no more than three inches long.

07:18.928 --> 07:22.019
The skin is serrated too,
on one side.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.856
Some kind of hunting tool?

07:24.957 --> 07:25.831
Maybe.

07:27.254 --> 07:29.113
And there were no other injuries?

07:29.255 --> 07:30.495
None I can find.

07:30.582 --> 07:33.515
- No... fractures or bruising?
- Nothing.

07:33.650 --> 07:35.590
Nothing to suggest a beating.

07:35.723 --> 07:36.446
No.

07:44.887 --> 07:46.159
It was here, weren't it?

07:50.101 --> 07:50.808
Ryan.

07:52.183 --> 07:53.113
What you doing here?

07:55.856 --> 07:57.343
Does your mum know
where you are?

07:57.462 --> 07:59.679
She's crying
with loads of people round her.

08:03.605 --> 08:06.082
Come on.
Let's get you back.

08:10.236 --> 08:13.662
Everyone wants me to cry,
but I can't.

08:13.776 --> 08:16.344
It's okay. You don't have to cry
if you don't want to.

08:16.407 --> 08:18.553
Tried pinching myself really hard.

08:19.022 --> 08:21.684
You can't make yourself feel
something that you don't.

08:21.763 --> 08:23.343
I feel bad and that,

08:23.547 --> 08:26.178
but I didn't see him much.
Only at weekends.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.542
- Why's that?
- He drove lorries round.

08:28.605 --> 08:30.390
Oh. 'Course he did.

08:32.442 --> 08:34.211
Wayne's dad died too.

08:34.634 --> 08:37.306
- Who's Wayne? Mate of yours?
- Best mate.

08:37.423 --> 08:39.159
Lives with his aunty and uncle.

08:39.238 --> 08:41.619
Cos his mam ran off
with an insurance man.

08:43.629 --> 08:45.215
Is your dad dead?

08:46.409 --> 08:49.247
No - actually, no, he's not.

08:49.345 --> 08:50.578
You're lucky.

08:50.696 --> 08:51.831
Yeah.

08:51.968 --> 08:54.865
- Do you live with him?
- No. Not anymore.

08:55.199 --> 08:59.231
To tell you the truth,
I'm not sure where he is.

08:59.368 --> 09:01.992
Dad promised to take me
to the match on Saturday.

09:02.461 --> 09:04.249
Can't somebody else take you?

09:05.222 --> 09:06.665
Not without me dad.

09:28.267 --> 09:31.379
<i>He scored, Sam,
did you see that?</i>

09:41.561 --> 09:43.832
Someone smells nice.

09:44.204 --> 09:46.201
New aftershave?

09:46.808 --> 09:50.390
- Long time no see.
- That's cos I've been avoiding you.

09:52.562 --> 09:54.559
I've got these for DCI Hunt.

09:54.696 --> 09:56.927
Copies of the statements
from the door-to-doors.

09:57.006 --> 09:58.924
Oh. I'll take them.

10:01.357 --> 10:03.001
So. How you been?

10:03.177 --> 10:05.194
Okay. You?

10:05.507 --> 10:07.053
Yeah, good.

10:07.445 --> 10:09.265
No more funny stuff?

10:09.852 --> 10:13.161
- Funny stuff?
- You know. The whole...

10:13.494 --> 10:16.488
time travel...
out of body experience thing.

10:16.586 --> 10:21.265
Well, I went to see Doctor Who
and he prescribed me some pills, so...

10:22.557 --> 10:25.239
You know, I can't work you out.
You're either mental-

10:25.336 --> 10:26.353
Or?

10:26.431 --> 10:29.181
Or... you just use that stuff
as a chat-up line.

10:29.260 --> 10:31.287
Make yourself sound interesting.

10:32.490 --> 10:34.820
"Please shag me,
I'm in a coma"?

10:35.309 --> 10:38.892
There's no need to be rude.
I was just saying.

10:39.381 --> 10:40.360
Sorry.

10:40.536 --> 10:42.670
If it was a chat-up line...

10:42.846 --> 10:44.491
would it work?

10:45.900 --> 10:47.505
No chance.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.260
This stuff from the alley...

11:18.646 --> 11:20.799
has Forensics been
through it yet?

11:20.897 --> 11:22.600
Yeah. Nothing there.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.521
What's that?

11:41.617 --> 11:43.144
A blakey.

11:43.594 --> 11:44.847
What?

11:45.689 --> 11:47.823
Stops your shoes wearing out.

11:47.940 --> 11:49.819
Was the victim wearing these?

12:00.743 --> 12:03.757
No sign of blakeys.
No markings.

12:04.931 --> 12:07.417
You carried out the interviews
in the pub, didn't you?

12:07.496 --> 12:08.396
Yeah.

12:08.514 --> 12:10.628
What colour was the carpet?

12:11.900 --> 12:13.652
It's hard to say.

12:13.930 --> 12:15.242
Try.

12:17.199 --> 12:20.879
Sort of... reddishy-purple.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.259
I think I've got something.

12:30.322 --> 12:32.577
Number for the special clinic
is on the notice board.

12:32.627 --> 12:35.096
I've just been reading through
the door-to-door report.

12:36.499 --> 12:37.426
And?

12:37.664 --> 12:40.471
A woman, at number 32,

12:40.659 --> 12:42.676
50 yards from the murder scene,

12:43.152 --> 12:44.605
heard a man's voice.

12:44.668 --> 12:46.772
She thinks
he was shouting "Carl".

12:47.820 --> 12:48.860
So?

12:49.512 --> 12:51.228
What if it wasn't Carl?

12:51.566 --> 12:53.133
What if it was Col?

12:54.172 --> 12:56.640
What if my uncle had tits,
would he be my auntie?

12:57.254 --> 12:58.557
If it was Col,

12:59.046 --> 13:00.913
that means
he knew the murderer.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.608
And then I found this
in the sweep from the alley.

13:04.709 --> 13:06.362
It didn't belong to the victim,

13:06.475 --> 13:09.532
and there are carpet fibres
in the spikes. Burgundy.

13:09.607 --> 13:11.812
The same colour as the carpet
in the Trafford Arms,

13:11.862 --> 13:13.854
which is where
he was drinking last night.

13:13.929 --> 13:15.307
So what are you saying?

13:15.368 --> 13:17.505
Whoever killed him
followed him out of the pub?

13:18.640 --> 13:20.934
Which means
it wasn't football-related.

13:21.059 --> 13:22.575
It's a United pub.

13:22.637 --> 13:24.692
You wouldn't find
a City supporter in there.

13:24.742 --> 13:28.739
Also, his wallet wasn't touched,
which means it wasn't robbery.

13:28.939 --> 13:31.357
This wasn't mindless violence.

13:31.482 --> 13:33.149
Someone had a motive.

13:33.249 --> 13:35.679
Otherwise,
why else follow him home?

13:36.684 --> 13:38.366
You're barking up the wrong tree.

13:38.422 --> 13:39.229
Why?

13:39.637 --> 13:42.614
Because, according to Chris,

13:42.772 --> 13:46.499
all those people you spoke to
this morning all said the same thing.

13:46.749 --> 13:48.953
Colin Clay was a good bloke,
salt of the earth,

13:48.998 --> 13:50.861
no one had a bad word
to say about him.

13:50.918 --> 13:53.020
- But...
- Right, was he in debt?

13:53.713 --> 13:56.008
Was he shagging
somebody else's wife?

13:56.429 --> 13:59.280
Right, was he the sort of bloke
that will go out and pick a fight?

13:59.894 --> 14:01.587
So what was the one thing

14:01.644 --> 14:03.870
that might have got him
killed in Trafford Park

14:03.927 --> 14:07.676
coming out of a United pub, two days
before the match against City?

14:07.756 --> 14:09.642
Or is that question
too difficult for you?

14:09.710 --> 14:12.107
You have no evidence
to back that up!

14:12.164 --> 14:13.482
And neither have you.

14:13.550 --> 14:15.914
Difference is,
I trust my guts,

14:16.016 --> 14:18.379
and they're telling me
this was about football.

14:18.447 --> 14:22.866
Which means we should be worrying
about the thousands of United fans

14:22.911 --> 14:25.307
who are looking
for revenge on Saturday.

14:25.378 --> 14:29.692
All the more reason to prove
it wasn't a City gang who did this.

14:30.277 --> 14:31.413
Look.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.963
- What if I had more evidence?
- How?

14:35.087 --> 14:36.702
Let me go undercover.

14:37.501 --> 14:38.903
Gain their trust.

14:39.028 --> 14:41.140
Find out who he was
drinking with last night.

14:41.247 --> 14:43.767
Find out what happened
in the Trafford Arms before he left.

14:44.602 --> 14:48.330
Come on. Let me show you
how clever I am.

14:48.791 --> 14:50.992
Just one shift in the pub.

14:53.513 --> 14:54.614
In the pub?

14:54.791 --> 14:58.146
Ray, go and arrest
the landlord of the Trafford Arms.

14:58.217 --> 15:00.613
- What for?
- Think of something on the way.

15:03.781 --> 15:06.781
Right. Listen up.
Einstein here's come up with a plan.

15:06.870 --> 15:09.444
He thinks that Colin Clay's killer
was drinking with him

15:09.515 --> 15:11.707
in the Trafford Arms
on the night of the murder.

15:11.832 --> 15:14.672
He also thinks there was a motive
apart from football violence,

15:14.708 --> 15:16.519
so we're thinking,
what, inside the box.

15:16.607 --> 15:19.252
- Outside.
- Yeah, that an' all.

15:19.839 --> 15:23.567
So, in a bizarre twist of fate,

15:23.797 --> 15:26.886
the landlord was arrested
this afternoon...

15:28.501 --> 15:31.111
on suspicion of cattle rustling.

15:35.177 --> 15:37.955
We're gonna refuse him bail
and keep him locked up for a bit

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
so that we can get
into the pub tomorrow night,

15:40.033 --> 15:41.976
work a shift,
posing as his replacement.

15:42.021 --> 15:44.987
That way we can dig about a bit,
see what we can find out.

15:45.021 --> 15:46.873
So we're going
undercover in a pub?

15:46.929 --> 15:48.486
The brewery have agreed.

15:48.974 --> 15:50.622
As far as the punters
are concerned,

15:50.679 --> 15:55.087
the undercover team will be
temporary manager, and barman.

15:55.518 --> 15:57.382
So, who's gonna do it?

15:57.677 --> 16:00.857
I volunteered myself
to lead the operation.

16:01.028 --> 16:04.516
Einstein here will be coming
with me as barman. Questions?

16:04.720 --> 16:05.708
Can I have a tab?

16:05.754 --> 16:07.844
Not on your wages.
Anyone else?

16:08.128 --> 16:10.684
Right. We go in tomorrow night.

16:10.889 --> 16:15.604
And as I'm risking my personal safety
in a boozer full of United scum...

16:16.353 --> 16:18.807
Ray, I want a full
back-up plan worked out.

16:19.164 --> 16:22.663
Oh, and there's a sweepstake
on Ray's desk for Saturday's match.

16:22.697 --> 16:24.458
I've got 2-0 City.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.548
We're gonna need
a plonk as well.

16:26.606 --> 16:27.299
What?

16:27.776 --> 16:29.878
We can't run a boozer
without a barmaid.

16:29.958 --> 16:32.877
- Oh, I really don't think-
- Good. Keep it that way.

16:32.968 --> 16:35.206
Make sure she's got nice tits.

16:35.354 --> 16:36.398
Just a thought.

16:36.467 --> 16:39.489
Do either of you two know
anything about running a pub?

16:44.591 --> 16:46.757
You want me
to teach you to work a bar?

16:46.792 --> 16:48.266
- Yeah.
- Now?

16:48.443 --> 16:50.076
We start tomorrow night.

16:50.272 --> 16:52.686
How hard can it be?
You do it.

16:52.828 --> 16:55.100
I can teach you how to pull a pint.

16:55.278 --> 16:58.810
But the bonhomie
associated with the profession...

16:58.935 --> 17:00.994
may take a little longer.

17:01.100 --> 17:03.381
We'll settle for
whatever you can give us.

17:03.455 --> 17:06.154
Two brown ale, double diamond,
gin and tonic, half a light ale,

17:06.202 --> 17:07.722
and a port and lemon.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.794
One ten.

17:10.160 --> 17:14.402
Four brown split, two Campari
and a Dubari and lemonade.

17:17.367 --> 17:19.194
Two quid.

17:19.676 --> 17:21.556
One sixty.

17:23.382 --> 17:28.268
It might be in your pub,
but in mine, it's two quid.

17:29.637 --> 17:31.597
And one for myself.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.995
Cheers.

17:40.432 --> 17:41.789
What can I get you?

17:41.971 --> 17:43.659
I could ask you the same thing.

17:44.162 --> 17:46.955
Didn't I tell you?
She's our new barmaid for tomorrow.

17:48.263 --> 17:49.234
Oh no.

17:49.592 --> 17:51.958
Looks like it could be a long night.

17:52.025 --> 17:54.391
- Have you done this before?
- It's why I got chosen.

17:54.483 --> 17:57.164
I was barmaid for six months
before I signed up.

17:57.546 --> 18:00.004
That and me nice tits,
apparently.

18:07.989 --> 18:08.611
What?

18:09.616 --> 18:10.355
Nothing.

18:10.744 --> 18:12.347
18 1/2p.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.931
Haven't you forgotten something?

18:21.039 --> 18:22.638
Oh yeah,
and one for yourself.

18:22.698 --> 18:24.621
Thank you very much,
don't mind if I do.

18:28.112 --> 18:29.863
Hey, it's a piece of piss, this.

18:29.937 --> 18:31.307
Snowball, Raymondo?

19:17.525 --> 19:19.551
Why did you promise him, Sam?

19:24.982 --> 19:27.547
Daddies always
let you down, don't they?

20:26.138 --> 20:26.702
Hiya.

20:27.740 --> 20:29.093
Are you going to see me mum?

20:29.434 --> 20:32.074
Uh, no, I'm just meeting
someone in the pub.

20:32.755 --> 20:33.809
This is Wayne.

20:34.419 --> 20:35.290
Hiya Wayne.

20:36.065 --> 20:38.091
He's gonna get the bloke
that killed me dad.

20:38.830 --> 20:41.220
Don't stay out too late,
eh, lads?

20:41.353 --> 20:43.163
Things might kick off later.

20:48.536 --> 20:50.716
Right. What we're looking for...

20:50.793 --> 20:54.140
is someone who had any
kind of dispute with the victim.

20:54.218 --> 20:55.995
They don't have to
have heard anything,

20:56.034 --> 20:58.525
they might have witnessed
a heated exchange,

20:58.603 --> 21:01.613
or sensed an atmosphere...
anything.

21:03.184 --> 21:04.144
Gene?

21:04.637 --> 21:06.984
- Don't you mean "guv"?
- We're undercover.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.398
He's right.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.331
Gene.

21:11.979 --> 21:14.249
Right!
Let's get set up,

21:14.391 --> 21:16.765
and hope
they're a talkative lot.

21:18.205 --> 21:20.359
Oi, you. Word.

21:22.527 --> 21:24.252
Were you in here
two nights ago?

21:24.369 --> 21:25.251
Gene.

21:27.068 --> 21:28.741
Wait here.

21:32.360 --> 21:36.018
Do you understand
the concept of "under cover"?

21:36.849 --> 21:38.029
Too direct?

21:38.237 --> 21:39.573
Little bit, yeah.

21:44.744 --> 21:45.963
This um...

21:46.689 --> 21:49.544
...shirt/jumper is
a nice combination, well done.

21:51.990 --> 21:53.469
Chicken and chips twice.

21:53.534 --> 21:56.609
Two pans, a spoon
and a big tub of dripping.

21:56.647 --> 21:57.983
So, what do you want?

21:58.710 --> 22:02.382
Olive oil would be nice,
bit of coriander...

22:04.288 --> 22:06.587
- It's a herb.
- This is Trafford Park.

22:06.620 --> 22:09.633
You've got more chance of finding
an ostrich with a plum up its arse.

22:09.730 --> 22:11.725
- Haven't got any plates.
- You're a smart lad,

22:11.790 --> 22:13.638
use your initiative!

22:24.453 --> 22:26.967
Chicken and chips twice.

22:27.761 --> 22:29.188
Over here, mate.

22:34.334 --> 22:35.340
What's this?

22:35.453 --> 22:37.691
It's chicken in a basket.

22:37.999 --> 22:39.523
Where's me plate?

22:39.669 --> 22:41.648
You don't need a plate.
It's in a basket.

22:42.994 --> 22:43.967
Word.

22:51.323 --> 22:54.728
Chicken... in a basket?

22:56.124 --> 22:58.622
You told me to use my initiative.

22:59.384 --> 23:01.605
Let's see how good
you really are.

23:01.703 --> 23:03.827
Two oxtail soups.

23:11.148 --> 23:12.413
Food's off.

23:16.296 --> 23:19.085
Yes, mate?
- Pint of brown split.

23:20.107 --> 23:21.307
Where's Frank?

23:21.842 --> 23:25.523
I don't know, I think he got into
a bit of trouble with the police.

23:25.718 --> 23:28.248
Brewery sent us down
to cover for him.

23:28.296 --> 23:29.853
Nothing to do with Col, is it?

23:30.242 --> 23:32.626
- Col?
- The bloke that were murdered?

23:34.475 --> 23:36.275
No, I don't think so.

23:37.652 --> 23:39.695
Why, did you know him, Col?

23:39.922 --> 23:43.263
Everyone knew Col.
He was a great bloke.

23:43.377 --> 23:47.123
Who'd kill someone because of
what football team they support?

23:47.932 --> 23:49.619
You think
that's what it was, then?

23:49.716 --> 23:51.792
That's what the papers are saying.

23:52.344 --> 23:54.095
Read it if you like.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.446
Cheers.

24:03.967 --> 24:05.167
Look at that.

24:06.610 --> 24:08.686
See? What'd I tell you?

24:08.751 --> 24:11.345
Just 'cause it's in the papers,
doesn't mean it's true.

24:11.653 --> 24:15.334
Look, it's in black and white. You just
don't like admitting you're wrong.

24:15.658 --> 24:17.167
I'm not wrong.

24:17.410 --> 24:18.707
So what've you found out,

24:18.756 --> 24:21.448
apart from how much lemonade
to put in a tart's Dubonnet?

24:21.578 --> 24:23.718
Give it a chance,
we've only just started.

24:23.782 --> 24:26.718
- We'd better get a move on.
- Yeah, and remember.

24:27.009 --> 24:29.960
Yeah, alright,
the softly softly approach.

24:44.271 --> 24:46.266
He didn't pay his tab.

24:48.164 --> 24:49.331
<i>What?</i>

24:50.839 --> 24:53.908
I arrested him
three months ago for assault.

24:54.346 --> 24:56.308
Did you have to hit him?

24:56.406 --> 24:58.124
Well, I thought
it were a good idea,

24:58.206 --> 25:02.438
just before he said "Hello Detective
Chief Inspector, fancy seeing you here."

25:02.616 --> 25:06.168
- We can't leave him here.
- He'll be fine.

25:06.459 --> 25:08.405
Okay then, Sherlock.

25:08.551 --> 25:11.876
You've got two hours to show me
how clever you are.

25:12.475 --> 25:14.567
So how well
did you know him then?

25:14.616 --> 25:17.097
There will never be
a woman Prime Minister,

25:17.145 --> 25:19.513
as long as I have
a hole in my arse.

25:21.848 --> 25:23.015
Cheers, mate.

25:23.388 --> 25:24.880
Same again.

25:26.161 --> 25:28.318
- How was the food?
- Oh, it was great, yeah.

25:28.447 --> 25:31.091
Apart from vinegar
going through the holes.

25:32.549 --> 25:33.977
It's Pete, innit?

25:34.171 --> 25:37.171
- Pete Bond, yeah.
- Sam.

25:38.185 --> 25:41.326
Must be weird, that,
going from one pub to another,

25:41.407 --> 25:43.495
covering for other people.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.279
It is a bit, yeah.

25:45.501 --> 25:47.326
So where was your last pub, then?

25:47.508 --> 25:50.244
It was.. other side of town.

25:50.548 --> 25:53.447
- So what was it called?
- The Nelson.

25:53.529 --> 25:56.955
Round the back of Hartford Street.
Do you know it?

26:00.047 --> 26:01.588
Cheers, Pete.

26:03.676 --> 26:04.588
Yes, lads?

26:04.669 --> 26:07.770
Four pints of malt and
two brown splits, please.

26:09.746 --> 26:12.868
- You going to the match?
- Yep. You?

26:13.070 --> 26:14.874
Can't. I'm working.

26:14.935 --> 26:17.206
That was a nasty business,
the other night.

26:17.266 --> 26:19.719
He were a top bloke, Col.
Couldn't believe it when I heard.

26:19.780 --> 26:21.361
- He a mate of yours?
- A good mate.

26:21.442 --> 26:23.104
City lot have got
a lot to answer for.

26:23.152 --> 26:24.980
So it's right,
what they say in the papers?

26:25.042 --> 26:27.472
Yes. They're gonna get
what's coming to 'em tomorrow.

26:27.508 --> 26:29.175
We all owe Colin that.

26:31.108 --> 26:32.946
Time to liven things up a bit.

26:33.290 --> 26:37.209
Hard to keep your stories straight
when you're pissed, you ask my missus.

26:37.669 --> 26:40.516
- I'm not sure that's ethical.
- It's not, it's vodka.

26:50.205 --> 26:51.048
Pete.

26:51.942 --> 26:54.431
Who's that?
- That's Coxy.

26:54.814 --> 26:57.061
He said he was
a mate of Colin's.

26:57.405 --> 26:59.167
Yeah, they got on okay.

26:59.843 --> 27:02.723
He's been dying to get stuck
into the City boys all season.

27:02.866 --> 27:05.189
Looks like
he'll get his chance now.

27:08.700 --> 27:10.628
- Noisy lot.
- I know.

27:11.164 --> 27:13.423
They're the only ones
we haven't talked to properly.

27:13.474 --> 27:14.840
Do you want me to try?

27:15.517 --> 27:16.717
No, I'll do it.

27:21.914 --> 27:24.033
Alright lads,
what do you reckon?

27:24.084 --> 27:26.114
Bobby Charlton
on the score sheet tomorrow?

27:27.352 --> 27:29.139
Fancy Lou Macari myself.

27:29.262 --> 27:30.667
Is that right, pal?

27:31.263 --> 27:33.371
Right, whose round is it?

27:39.073 --> 27:41.299
They're not exactly friendly,
are they?

27:42.392 --> 27:44.622
That's because you're not
their kind of people.

27:46.239 --> 27:49.017
Is that right?
And who is "their kind of people"?

27:49.442 --> 27:50.235
Me.

28:09.754 --> 28:12.116
You look like a man
wishing he was somewhere else.

28:12.353 --> 28:14.445
Sorry, Pete,
I was miles away there.

28:14.657 --> 28:16.585
So, going to the match tomorrow?

28:17.035 --> 28:18.342
No, I doubt it.

28:18.432 --> 28:19.932
You don't know
what you're missing.

28:19.993 --> 28:21.615
I used to go a lot
when I was younger.

28:21.664 --> 28:23.240
- United man?
- Oh yeah.

28:23.592 --> 28:25.716
Once a Red,
always a Red.

28:25.942 --> 28:28.703
All those people, all coming
together for one thing,

28:28.822 --> 28:31.264
and most of them you've never
seen before in your life.

28:31.391 --> 28:33.867
But if they're wearing red,
you're mates.

28:34.636 --> 28:38.555
It makes you feel like
you really belong to something.

28:41.497 --> 28:44.242
I can't remember the last time
I went to a match.

28:44.753 --> 28:46.259
I think it was...

28:47.536 --> 28:49.885
I think it was about now.

28:51.021 --> 28:53.561
Now, this time of year.

28:54.289 --> 28:55.897
So why'd you stop going then?

28:56.625 --> 28:58.693
It just sort of happened.

28:59.089 --> 29:00.480
But you miss it though?

29:00.697 --> 29:03.914
I never really thought it,
but yeah, I suppose I do.

29:03.978 --> 29:05.625
You should come back.

29:06.071 --> 29:08.944
Once a Red, always a Red,
remember.

29:09.059 --> 29:11.344
Pete, you go, mate.

29:12.621 --> 29:14.446
Let us know if you fancy it.

29:14.625 --> 29:16.744
Get the old blood
pumping again, eh?

29:20.964 --> 29:22.342
Still nothing?

29:23.619 --> 29:26.287
Who was this bloke,
St Francis of Assisi?

29:26.440 --> 29:28.636
No one'll say
a bad word against him.

29:31.266 --> 29:33.360
I'm gonna get some air.

30:09.904 --> 30:13.121
You killed me dad!
I'm gonna kill you!

30:13.274 --> 30:14.436
Get off me!

30:15.636 --> 30:17.806
He killed me dad!
Get off!

30:19.524 --> 30:20.353
Wayne!

30:21.324 --> 30:23.290
I didn't do anything!

30:25.651 --> 30:27.847
- What's going on?
- It were him.

30:28.331 --> 30:29.966
I saw it in the papers.

30:30.438 --> 30:33.335
- Saw what?
- That City lot killed me dad.

30:34.114 --> 30:36.233
Even if that's true,
it wasn't Wayne.

30:36.412 --> 30:38.966
Well, he supports City.
I hate him!

30:39.961 --> 30:41.902
Ryan, it doesn't work
like that, mate.

30:42.619 --> 30:46.002
What if it had been a City fan killed,
would that have been your fault?

30:46.449 --> 30:48.492
You can't start ripping
lumps out of people

30:48.543 --> 30:50.700
just 'cause of which
football team they support!

30:50.828 --> 30:52.717
- They killed me dad.
- No, they didn't!

30:52.794 --> 30:54.121
Who did then?

30:58.772 --> 31:00.176
I don't know.

31:06.871 --> 31:08.020
It don't matter.

31:10.203 --> 31:12.067
If you break your promise.

31:15.066 --> 31:17.275
That's what grown-ups do, innit?

31:23.116 --> 31:25.542
I used to go to
the football with my dad.

31:26.716 --> 31:29.027
Every Saturday,
watch United.

31:31.465 --> 31:34.043
It was the only time of the week
I got him all to myself,

31:34.107 --> 31:35.295
you know what I mean?

31:37.056 --> 31:38.422
'Course you do.

31:39.007 --> 31:40.641
Just me and me dad.

31:42.147 --> 31:43.768
Then when he left,

31:45.555 --> 31:47.087
I never went again.

31:48.134 --> 31:49.858
Well, I'm not either.

31:51.038 --> 31:52.761
The thing is, mate,

31:52.991 --> 31:57.102
if you stop doing all the things
you used to do with your dad,

31:58.200 --> 32:00.331
you lose him all over again.

32:01.761 --> 32:04.340
And that thing
that you're feeling now,

32:05.004 --> 32:06.804
it will never go away.

32:09.795 --> 32:11.467
I really miss him.

32:16.574 --> 32:17.825
I know.

32:34.321 --> 32:35.868
There's gonna be trouble.

32:37.359 --> 32:39.555
If there is, call the station.

32:39.606 --> 32:41.368
Back-up's on stand-by.

32:45.832 --> 32:47.379
Can I have a word?

32:47.616 --> 32:50.751
As long as the words are
"it's my round",

32:50.813 --> 32:52.359
and "what're you having?".

32:55.606 --> 32:56.467
Now!

32:56.986 --> 33:00.027
Sorry, lads!
Tinkerbell here needs a hand!

33:00.120 --> 33:01.822
I'll be back in a minute!

33:08.586 --> 33:11.222
What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?

33:13.842 --> 33:15.845
I tell you what I'm doing,
you little prick.

33:15.991 --> 33:17.859
I'm getting me hands dirty!

33:18.087 --> 33:19.706
Now, I've come here
on your say-so,

33:19.778 --> 33:21.771
even though I know
you're wrong about this,

33:21.864 --> 33:23.776
so while you're pussy-footing
about out there,

33:23.808 --> 33:26.076
asking what colour underpants
Denis Law is wearing,

33:26.138 --> 33:28.131
I'm doing some male bonding
on the off chance

33:28.183 --> 33:31.203
that you are not as stupid
as you might look!

33:31.846 --> 33:34.493
- I thought you were drunk.
- Yeah, well, think again.

33:34.577 --> 33:36.933
I could drink every one
of them toe-rags under the table

33:36.964 --> 33:39.164
and still stop off
for a pint of me way home.

33:39.579 --> 33:41.156
How'd you think I became a DCI,

33:41.177 --> 33:43.772
you think they give away
badges in them Lucky Bags?

33:46.157 --> 33:48.399
Right, well,
let's finish what we started.

33:48.461 --> 33:51.388
And if I want a bollocking for
drinking too much, I'll phone the wife.

33:51.439 --> 33:52.477
Are we done?

33:53.380 --> 33:55.289
- Yes, guv.
- Good.

34:03.954 --> 34:05.542
They're a lively lot, aren't they?

34:05.656 --> 34:08.032
And they haven't got
a brain cell between them.

34:08.125 --> 34:10.159
So what's he like, this Coxy?

34:10.232 --> 34:13.014
He's the local hard nut.
At least, he thinks he is.

34:13.190 --> 34:15.319
Right! Let's have a drink!

34:17.297 --> 34:18.739
Get 'em in, lovely bumps.

34:20.277 --> 34:21.886
Hey, keep your hands to yourself.

34:22.217 --> 34:25.425
Here's to cracking
a few heads tomorrow!

34:31.891 --> 34:33.551
Do we know who got Colin, then?

34:33.592 --> 34:34.319
What?

34:34.734 --> 34:37.172
Colin. Who's in the frame?

34:37.214 --> 34:38.937
It were City lot, who else?

34:39.507 --> 34:42.455
Dunno, I heard it might not be.

34:42.518 --> 34:44.147
- From who?
- Someone.

34:44.178 --> 34:46.472
Well, whoever it is,
is talking out their arse.

34:46.502 --> 34:48.440
Why the concern,
you didn't even know Col.

34:48.472 --> 34:50.259
He's a Red and
that's good enough for me.

34:50.299 --> 34:51.958
It was City lot, weren't it lads?

34:52.022 --> 34:54.719
They'll get what's coming to 'em
tomorrow, don't worry about that.

34:54.989 --> 34:56.763
So what's the plan, then lads?

34:57.002 --> 35:00.178
What, I meet you tonight and suddenly
you want to know all of my business?

35:00.218 --> 35:01.090
What's your problem?

35:01.183 --> 35:03.975
People sticking their noses
in things that don't concern 'em.

35:04.461 --> 35:07.274
Hey, come on.
We've all had a drink...

35:08.279 --> 35:11.036
What's wrong, we're just
having a friendly little talk.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.837
Who said that you were my friend?

35:14.940 --> 35:17.956
Why are you so interested in
what I do and what I don't do?

35:18.020 --> 35:20.080
Are you a copper or what?

35:20.729 --> 35:24.685
Forget it mate.
If they don't wanna chat, forget it.

35:27.312 --> 35:29.259
Piss off, the lot of you.

35:29.356 --> 35:30.913
- You what?
- We're shut.

35:30.978 --> 35:32.356
You've just ordered more drinks.

35:32.437 --> 35:35.259
I've just ordered drinks for my mates,
like you said you aren't one.

35:35.307 --> 35:37.820
Are you leaving or
am I throwing you out?

35:38.144 --> 35:40.269
What, all of us?

35:50.485 --> 35:51.669
Right then.

35:52.123 --> 35:53.810
Come on, who's next?

36:00.234 --> 36:02.099
You've got some guts.

36:03.169 --> 36:05.245
Enough to take on you
bunch of girls.

36:05.277 --> 36:08.050
Come on, Coxy.
It's a big day tomorrow.

36:08.164 --> 36:10.093
Let's just have a drink, eh?

36:14.650 --> 36:18.883
Yeah, we erupt between ourselves,
we all get banged up and miss tomorrow.

36:19.353 --> 36:21.639
What say we have
another drink then, eh?

36:24.462 --> 36:26.894
Come on, Gene,
shake his hand.

36:31.257 --> 36:33.300
Get the beers in.

36:35.116 --> 36:37.192
Your mate's got some balls.

36:37.322 --> 36:41.068
If they were any bigger,
he'd need a wheelbarrow.

36:41.182 --> 36:45.073
- You gonna join us, sweetheart?
- Maybe later.

36:45.187 --> 36:48.106
- Looks like you've made a new friend.
- Slimy git.

36:48.219 --> 36:51.965
Mind you, he wears
the same aftershave as you.

36:52.549 --> 36:54.544
I don't wear aftershave.

37:08.438 --> 37:09.963
How is he?

37:10.062 --> 37:13.110
Oh, he's okay.
He's just pretending to be drunk.

37:13.189 --> 37:14.545
Really.

37:14.785 --> 37:18.806
They don't give away DCI badges
in Lucky Bags, you know.

37:18.885 --> 37:21.119
Smart-arse.

37:21.455 --> 37:23.226
You'd better sit him up.

37:24.375 --> 37:26.338
We've made you some coffee.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.348
Up your arse.

37:28.476 --> 37:30.104
Come on, drink this.

37:30.662 --> 37:32.178
Smells like shit.

37:32.273 --> 37:34.747
Oh, fine.
And you smell like a brewery.

37:34.795 --> 37:36.582
Maybe we should
walk him round for a bit.

37:36.694 --> 37:39.136
I don't think we'll get
any sense out of him tonight.

37:39.231 --> 37:40.572
Sir!

37:40.971 --> 37:42.806
Did he tell you anything?

37:42.998 --> 37:45.232
I know what you're thinking.

37:45.344 --> 37:46.540
Really?

37:46.939 --> 37:49.971
You think I'm pissed.

37:50.514 --> 37:52.237
Now you come to mention it...

37:52.333 --> 37:53.945
Well, I'm not.

37:57.376 --> 37:58.588
I...

37:59.051 --> 38:00.407
am...

38:00.950 --> 38:02.673
a professional...

38:03.009 --> 38:05.418
police officer.

38:11.083 --> 38:12.855
So, we got nothing.

38:22.094 --> 38:23.163
Right.

38:23.674 --> 38:27.104
Since your daft idea didn't do anything
but take our eye off the ball,

38:27.233 --> 38:29.371
we're gonna have to
drag in the hooligans again.

38:29.435 --> 38:30.583
What good will that do?

38:30.680 --> 38:32.690
Right now,
it's the only choice we got.

38:32.882 --> 38:36.616
Even if I don't know anything, it might
stop someone else from getting killed.

38:50.591 --> 38:51.740
Hiya.

39:01.282 --> 39:02.798
Look, I'm...

39:03.835 --> 39:07.010
I'm still gonna try
and keep that promise, okay?

39:08.798 --> 39:12.324
It's just...
it might take a little bit longer.

39:12.803 --> 39:14.638
Are you going to the match?

39:15.717 --> 39:17.568
You've got your scarf on.

39:19.563 --> 39:20.983
It isn't mine.

39:21.733 --> 39:23.106
It's me dad's.

39:24.478 --> 39:28.005
Me mam wanted to throw it away,
after what the papers said.

39:28.915 --> 39:31.771
I'm only wearing it
cos I can smell him.

39:39.186 --> 39:40.383
Hang on...

39:42.155 --> 39:46.208
We found your dad's scarf
in that alley.

39:46.829 --> 39:48.808
He was wearing it.

39:51.122 --> 39:52.941
I've got it at the station.

39:53.021 --> 39:55.063
He only wore it match days.

39:58.219 --> 40:01.793
So he wasn't wearing it
when he left the house?

40:03.182 --> 40:05.496
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

40:05.734 --> 40:08.351
He only had one.
This one.

40:16.972 --> 40:20.355
Malcolm Cox is on the list of people
drinking in the pub that night.

40:20.467 --> 40:24.009
I want you to check for any
previous convictions for assault.

40:25.014 --> 40:26.147
Move!

40:27.650 --> 40:28.751
Smell that.

40:28.863 --> 40:30.475
- I'm sorry?
- Smell it.

40:31.273 --> 40:33.922
- Kinky.
- Please.

40:35.549 --> 40:37.511
Well?
- Well what?

40:37.607 --> 40:40.990
When you dropped off those reports,
you said that I smelled nice.

40:41.150 --> 40:42.809
Is this what you smelt?

40:43.001 --> 40:44.549
Yeah, so?

40:44.788 --> 40:46.480
I don't wear aftershave.

40:46.591 --> 40:48.139
No, but you talk gibberish.

40:48.219 --> 40:49.735
But in the pub last night,

40:49.799 --> 40:52.639
you said that Malcolm Cox was
wearing the same aftershave as me.

40:54.107 --> 40:56.848
- Is this it?
- I suppose so.

41:02.035 --> 41:02.928
Right.

41:03.231 --> 41:04.779
The lads in the pub said

41:04.843 --> 41:07.827
that Malcolm Cox was spoiling
for a fight with the City fans,

41:07.907 --> 41:10.236
but none of the United fans
were interested.

41:10.747 --> 41:11.689
So?

41:11.896 --> 41:13.284
But now they are.

41:13.651 --> 41:15.646
So what's made 'em
change their mind?

41:15.790 --> 41:16.891
Go on.

41:17.114 --> 41:21.455
This scarf was found at the scene
where Colin Clay was killed.

41:21.615 --> 41:23.689
Now, I've just come back
from his house.

41:23.881 --> 41:25.588
This scarf wasn't his.

41:25.923 --> 41:28.189
I think it belonged
to whoever killed him.

41:28.397 --> 41:31.013
- Yeah, but it's a United scarf.
- Exactly.

41:31.189 --> 41:34.236
And whoever dropped it
was wearing the same aftershave

41:34.412 --> 41:36.359
that Malcolm Cox was wearing.

41:36.455 --> 41:37.412
Smell it.

41:37.667 --> 41:40.540
Yeah, him and
two million others, no doubt.

41:41.401 --> 41:42.613
Hai-Karate.

41:42.709 --> 41:46.762
Cox has got eight previous
convictions for assault.

41:46.985 --> 41:48.916
I found out that bit.

41:49.140 --> 41:52.171
The weapon that killed Colin Clay
was no more than three inches long

41:52.251 --> 41:53.991
and serrated on one side.

41:55.826 --> 41:58.443
When you squared up to him last night,

41:58.970 --> 42:03.869
Malcolm Cox put his keys
through his fingers, like that.

42:04.332 --> 42:07.268
Keys. I think that's
what killed Colin Clay.

42:07.428 --> 42:08.992
A ready-made knuckleduster,

42:09.039 --> 42:11.369
that the police would never spot
if they picked you up.

42:11.433 --> 42:13.890
So you think Cox killed Clay?

42:14.066 --> 42:16.332
All makes sense.

42:16.587 --> 42:18.518
I doubt he meant to kill him,

42:18.757 --> 42:21.087
but he thought that
by attacking a United supporter,

42:21.151 --> 42:23.114
making it look like
it was the City fans,

42:23.161 --> 42:24.869
the United faithful would back him.

42:24.965 --> 42:26.991
All went wrong. Clay died.

42:27.407 --> 42:29.353
If we can prove that...

42:29.465 --> 42:31.651
We can stop the hooligans
taking over this match.

42:31.699 --> 42:33.119
Kick-off's in two hours.

42:33.231 --> 42:35.305
So the City fans are innocent?

42:36.646 --> 42:38.864
In that case,
I approve of your findings.

42:38.927 --> 42:40.475
You got an address?

42:43.810 --> 42:46.395
- <i>Who is it!</i>
- The milkman.

42:49.268 --> 42:50.800
Alright lads,

42:51.119 --> 42:52.571
what's happening?

42:52.907 --> 42:54.375
You're nicked.

43:08.988 --> 43:11.270
Mind the bloody paintwork!

43:18.125 --> 43:19.609
New scarf?

43:22.002 --> 43:24.265
Where did you go
when you left the Trafford Arms

43:24.329 --> 43:26.930
the night Colin Clay was killed?
- Home.

43:26.993 --> 43:28.430
Can anyone vouch for that?

43:28.541 --> 43:30.201
- Who?
- Me cat.

43:30.424 --> 43:31.861
You're quiet.

43:32.020 --> 43:34.382
I'm just waiting for the
Boy Wonder to get bored,

43:34.446 --> 43:36.600
then I'll bounce you
round the walls.

43:36.808 --> 43:38.738
You followed him home
that night, didn't you ?

43:38.802 --> 43:40.191
Prove it.

43:41.324 --> 43:44.914
So, what, you just thought
you were gonna beat him up a bit,

43:45.074 --> 43:48.185
and with the match coming up, everyone
would blame it on the City boys.

43:48.265 --> 43:50.786
Come on, you Reds!

43:50.881 --> 43:53.339
Had to be somebody
well-liked though, didn't it?

43:53.435 --> 43:56.259
A nice bloke, just to get
everybody angry enough.

43:56.419 --> 43:57.919
Nah, that's bollocks.

43:58.222 --> 44:01.078
So, someone shouted out
his name, he stopped,

44:01.270 --> 44:04.126
giving you the chance
to sneak up behind him,

44:04.413 --> 44:06.488
punch him in the back of the head.

44:07.046 --> 44:08.897
Is that what happened?

44:14.450 --> 44:16.700
He asked you a bloody question.

44:17.099 --> 44:19.971
Only you used your keys,
though, didn't you?

44:20.243 --> 44:21.679
Like this.

44:22.253 --> 44:25.636
Just like you were gonna do
last night, in the pub, you remember?

44:25.843 --> 44:28.348
He must have gone down
like a sack of spuds.

44:28.460 --> 44:29.991
Don't know
what you're talking about.

44:30.071 --> 44:33.055
- You ran away, didn't you?
- I told you, I was at home.

44:33.136 --> 44:36.583
So scared, you dropped
your scarf. The other scarf.

44:36.678 --> 44:38.434
I didn't kill anyone!

44:38.561 --> 44:40.556
And that scarf
is now in Forensics.

44:40.652 --> 44:43.173
- Foreign-what?
- A bloke with tweezers...

44:43.286 --> 44:47.562
is pulling out little strands
of hair and skin from the fibres.

44:47.658 --> 44:50.849
And what are the odds
it's gonna be your hair, Coxy?

44:50.929 --> 44:52.732
We're gonna see to it you get life.

44:52.796 --> 44:54.759
I told you,
me scarf was nicked.

44:54.839 --> 44:56.993
You were seen wearing it
the night he was killed!

44:57.041 --> 44:59.402
See, jurors love all that,
makes them feel like Columbo.

44:59.466 --> 45:00.950
No, you've done it wrong!

45:01.014 --> 45:02.545
One more thing.

45:03.876 --> 45:05.743
Missing a blakey?

45:06.589 --> 45:09.605
Malcolm Cox, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Colin Clay.

45:10.482 --> 45:12.972
- I didn't kill him!
- Who did then?!

45:15.087 --> 45:18.262
You do not have to say anything
unless you wish to do so...

45:18.358 --> 45:20.959
- It was an accident!
- Did you hit him?

45:21.485 --> 45:23.512
Did you hit him?

45:23.592 --> 45:25.546
- But anything you do say...
- It wasn't me!

45:25.610 --> 45:28.156
- may be given in evidence...
- It was Pete!

45:29.440 --> 45:31.546
It was Pete's idea.

45:32.279 --> 45:34.210
None of the lads wanted to take on City

45:34.242 --> 45:36.221
and he was in the pub
that night and he said...

45:36.301 --> 45:39.428
if we beat up a United fan,
it'd bring 'em round.

45:39.508 --> 45:40.944
Pete... Bond?

45:41.104 --> 45:43.881
Yeah. We only meant
to rough him up a bit.

45:44.455 --> 45:47.662
He was the one who showed me
how to use the keys, it's his trademark.

45:47.854 --> 45:49.753
I just went along to help him.

45:49.933 --> 45:53.064
We were just gonna rough him up bit,
but when Pete hit him he went down.

45:53.144 --> 45:54.740
I didn't know
what to do, so I ran.

45:54.899 --> 45:58.171
Peter Bond.
Where can we find him?

45:58.737 --> 46:00.353
The United faithful...

46:00.413 --> 46:03.903
are still blaming the City fans
for the death of Colin Clay.

46:04.003 --> 46:07.793
As you can imagine, the Blues
aren't too happy about that.

46:07.933 --> 46:11.404
So in one hour, both sides are gonna
meet at the old textiles factory

46:11.483 --> 46:13.737
behind the shops in Leaming Road.

46:13.856 --> 46:15.902
this is gonna be bigger and uglier

46:15.979 --> 46:18.800
than any pre-match scrap
you've ever dealt with before,

46:19.004 --> 46:20.319
so let's get a move on.

46:20.409 --> 46:22.604
Come on, you heard him,
chop chop!

46:22.711 --> 46:23.582
Where's Ray?

46:23.697 --> 46:25.835
He phoned in sick.
In bed with flu, he said.

46:26.416 --> 46:27.786
Right, come on, load up!

46:28.782 --> 46:30.618
Phyllis, at one o'clock,

46:30.658 --> 46:32.560
I want you to call
the local radio stations

46:32.601 --> 46:34.884
and tell'em we've found
the man who killed Colin Clay.

46:34.947 --> 46:36.452
- What for?
- Just do it.

46:36.539 --> 46:39.847
And be sure to tell 'em
the killer was a United supporter.

46:39.899 --> 46:42.001
That way, we might save
someone from a kicking.

46:42.066 --> 46:45.361
Talking of which, shouldn't this lot
be wearing protective clothing?

46:45.440 --> 46:46.893
- You what?
- You know...

46:47.009 --> 46:49.513
Visors, shields, stab vests...

46:49.565 --> 46:51.161
They've got helmets.

46:54.707 --> 46:57.016
Come on, hurry up,
they're waiting for you.

46:59.842 --> 47:01.282
Wagons roll!

47:33.036 --> 47:35.347
Everyone sit tight.

47:38.689 --> 47:39.581
There.

47:41.342 --> 47:42.938
Okay, let's have 'em.

47:43.042 --> 47:44.067
Wait.

47:57.856 --> 47:59.076
Bloody hell.

48:02.695 --> 48:04.550
Alright lads, tool up.

48:08.963 --> 48:10.468
Haven't you got anything?

48:11.702 --> 48:12.429
No.

48:13.545 --> 48:14.699
Good luck.

48:15.867 --> 48:17.527
Go go go go go go go!

48:54.797 --> 48:55.615
Yes!

48:55.731 --> 48:58.365
So you thought you'd come
to the match after all, Sam?

48:58.598 --> 49:00.051
I'm a police officer.

49:13.597 --> 49:15.102
What's your problem?

49:15.517 --> 49:16.502
You are.

49:16.567 --> 49:18.383
Do you know how long
I've waited for this?

49:18.440 --> 49:20.887
- I'm not interested.
- None of them would have it.

49:21.134 --> 49:24.306
So, what, you thought you'd beat up
a United supporter, get them on side?

49:24.358 --> 49:25.588
They had no bottle.

49:25.666 --> 49:29.874
What was it you said to me, Pete?
"Once a Red, always a Red"?

49:29.991 --> 49:31.519
It's football.

49:45.963 --> 49:48.627
You know nothing about football!

49:51.774 --> 49:55.828
Peter Bond, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Colin Clay.

49:55.905 --> 49:59.142
You are not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so,

49:59.233 --> 50:02.665
anything you do say
may be given as evidence.

50:03.468 --> 50:05.398
- Prove it!
- I have.

50:05.657 --> 50:06.564
Piss off!

50:17.274 --> 50:18.879
This is the buzz, man.

50:18.970 --> 50:21.923
This is what we do.
It's the game.

50:24.045 --> 50:26.195
I used to go to football
with my dad.

50:28.410 --> 50:32.179
United and City fans used to
walk to the match together.

50:33.526 --> 50:36.880
Our next door neighbour,
he had a City flag up in his window.

50:37.761 --> 50:40.148
Kids used to play together
in the street.

50:40.316 --> 50:41.689
Red and Blue.

50:43.749 --> 50:46.183
And then people like you came along,

50:46.300 --> 50:47.776
and you took it away from us.

50:47.841 --> 50:49.939
Look, a good punch-up's
all part of the game.

50:50.017 --> 50:53.320
It's about pride.
Pride in your team.

50:53.527 --> 50:54.913
Being the best.

50:56.270 --> 50:57.720
No, it isn't.

51:00.064 --> 51:02.253
This how it starts.

51:04.374 --> 51:06.498
And then it escalates.

51:06.887 --> 51:09.813
It gets on the telly
and in the press,

51:09.917 --> 51:13.828
and then other fans from other clubs
start trying to outdo each other,

51:13.944 --> 51:15.913
and then it becomes about hate.

51:15.991 --> 51:18.594
And then it's nothing to do
with football anymore!

51:18.775 --> 51:20.472
It's about gangs,

51:20.601 --> 51:22.622
and scumbags like you,

51:22.868 --> 51:24.616
roaming the country,

51:24.759 --> 51:27.271
seeing who can cause
the most trouble!

51:28.031 --> 51:29.831
And then we overreact,

51:29.909 --> 51:32.343
and we have to put up
perimeter fences,

51:32.485 --> 51:35.127
and we treat the fans like animals!

51:35.244 --> 51:39.207
Forty, fifty thousand people,
herded into pens.

51:42.572 --> 51:46.251
And then how long
before something happens?

51:48.385 --> 51:51.674
How long before
something terrible happens,

51:51.765 --> 51:54.497
and we are dragging bodies out?

51:58.235 --> 52:00.100
Thought you were a United man.

52:05.963 --> 52:07.284
You killed somebody.

52:11.085 --> 52:12.445
It went wrong.

52:13.637 --> 52:15.761
I was just gonna give him a kicking.

52:18.114 --> 52:19.267
He's dead.

52:29.226 --> 52:30.404
That's mine.

52:32.697 --> 52:34.794
This doesn't belong to you.

52:34.911 --> 52:37.903
This belongs to decent people

52:38.032 --> 52:42.824
who work all week and take their kids
to the football on a Saturday.

52:43.873 --> 52:46.243
People like Colin Clay.

52:50.199 --> 52:51.546
You alright, boss?

52:56.451 --> 52:57.643
Lock him up.

53:08.125 --> 53:09.873
You're sure
you don't wanna be here?

53:10.585 --> 53:13.563
No, you go on. I've got something
I need to do first.

53:14.858 --> 53:15.959
I'm ready then.

53:17.885 --> 53:20.164
- What for?
- An apology.

53:21.291 --> 53:23.622
Was this,
or was this not,

53:23.674 --> 53:25.694
a football-related crime?

53:25.836 --> 53:28.867
Was the murderer drinking
with him in the Trafford Arms?

53:28.957 --> 53:30.421
Don't try and wheedle out of this.

53:30.485 --> 53:32.506
I'm right, you're wrong,
admit it.

53:32.596 --> 53:35.587
We caught him because
I convinced you to go undercover.

53:35.638 --> 53:37.788
Before that, you were just
dragging hooligans in.

53:37.840 --> 53:38.747
Still about football!

53:38.798 --> 53:41.592
- Not in the way you were thinking.
- It was still about football!

53:41.686 --> 53:44.160
You just will *not* be
proved wrong, will you?

53:44.237 --> 53:46.012
You know, that's very childish.

53:46.220 --> 53:47.618
- No it is not.
- Yes it is.

53:52.551 --> 53:54.144
I thought he had flu?

53:54.260 --> 53:55.828
Sergeant!

53:56.691 --> 53:59.294
Come back here,
you scabby little git!

54:31.090 --> 54:31.750
Hiya.

54:32.407 --> 54:35.438
My mum told me that you caught
the bloke that killed me dad.

54:36.526 --> 54:38.456
I promised you, didn't I?

54:42.172 --> 54:44.244
Do you know anyone
that wants this?

54:44.387 --> 54:45.371
What is it?

54:45.565 --> 54:47.158
It's a ticket for the match.

54:53.361 --> 54:55.640
Do you remember
when I told you about my dad?

54:57.350 --> 54:59.953
I was wrong
never to go to a match again.

55:02.285 --> 55:04.409
Hey, you never know.
Maybe one day,

55:05.328 --> 55:07.245
me and you can go
to a match together.

55:07.323 --> 55:08.825
I'd like that.

55:09.149 --> 55:10.547
So would I.

55:11.634 --> 55:15.351
But for now, I've only got
the one ticket. So-

55:18.827 --> 55:21.600
Have you got anyone
that can take you down there?

55:24.207 --> 55:26.059
There you are,
isn't that your mate?

55:26.655 --> 55:28.002
Is that his uncle?

55:30.454 --> 55:32.111
Looks like they're going.

55:36.204 --> 55:37.732
Thanks, mister.

56:03.162 --> 56:04.807
<i>You excited
about the match, Sam?</i>
