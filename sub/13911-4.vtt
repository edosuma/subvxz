IN BRIEF, BORING

08:54.029 --> 08:56.003
ABBREVIATED SENTENCES,

08:56.005 --> 08:57.023
BUT INSTEAD WILL WOW THE CROWDS

08:57.025 --> 09:01.011

OF AN OVERABUNDANCE OF NOUNS,

09:01.013 --> 09:02.023

09:02.025 --> 09:05.029

THE CONJUNCTION JUNCTIONS

09:06.001 --> 09:08.004
WHICH HAVE A MULTIPLE
OF FUNCTIONS.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.016
WITH THE SKILL OF MO' LINGUISH,

09:09.018 --> 09:12.027

NOT YOURS TO BE TAKEN,

09:12.029 --> 09:15.015

09:16.013 --> 09:17.012
- HE'S DONE IT.

09:17.014 --> 09:19.017

TO BRING TOWNSVILLE

09:19.019 --> 09:21.004

09:21.006 --> 09:23.027
BY HAVING ALL OF THE PEOPLE
SPEAK IN THE MOST LENGTHY
OF QUESTIONS

09:23.029 --> 09:25.001
AND REDUNDANT OF ANSWERS!

09:25.003 --> 09:26.028
THUS NOTHING CAN BE
ASKED OR ANSWERED

09:27.000 --> 09:28.013
WITHOUT THE VERBOSITY OF WORDS

09:28.015 --> 09:30.012
CAUSING THE CITY TO
COME TO A PERMANENT

09:30.014 --> 09:31.022
AND MOST PAINFUL HALT.

09:31.024 --> 09:32.025

09:35.019 --> 09:38.013
BRINGING THEIR SPEECH
PATTERNS BACK TO NORMAL.

COME ON!

09:40.015 --> 09:41.029
MA'AM, OFFICER,

09:42.001 --> 09:42.027
ALL THIS CAN BE SOLVED

09:42.029 --> 09:44.013
BY YOU BRIEFLY
STATING YOUR POINT

09:44.015 --> 09:45.012
AND MOVING ON.

09:45.014 --> 09:47.006
- BUT IF I WERE
TO SPEAK BRIEFLY,

09:47.008 --> 09:48.019
IT WOULD MEAN THAT
I DID NOT SPEAK

09:48.021 --> 09:50.002
ALL THAT I WISHED
TO HAVE SPOKEN,

09:50.004 --> 09:51.029
MEANING THAT I WOULD NOT
FULLY EXPRESS MYSELF

09:52.001 --> 09:55.012
TO THE FULLEST, AND THUS SPOKEN
IN TOO SMALL OF A SENTENCE

09:55.014 --> 09:56.029
TO PROPERLY SATISFY.

09:57.001 --> 09:59.015
- AND IF I SIMPLY
SAID YES OR NO,

09:59.017 --> 10:01.022
THE REASONINGS BEHIND
THAT YES OR NO

10:01.024 --> 10:03.029
WOULD BE UNHEARD AND UNVOICED

10:04.001 --> 10:05.007
AND UNPONTIFICATED,

10:05.009 --> 10:08.018
THUS LEAVING ME WITH A FEELING
OF STIFLED COMBUSTION

10:08.020 --> 10:11.002
THAT WOULD BE READY TO EXPLODE.

10:11.004 --> 10:13.011
- OH, THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.008
- CERTAINLY NOT IF
OUR WISH IS TO

10:15.010 --> 10:16.008
REMEDY THIS SITUATION

10:16.010 --> 10:18.016

LACKING CLOSURE--

10:18.018 --> 10:19.012

10:19.014 --> 10:21.002
- SOMEONE HAS TO RETEACH THEM.

10:21.004 --> 10:23.005
- BUT DO WE KNOW WHOSE
ENGLISH IS GOOD ENOUGH

10:23.007 --> 10:24.015
TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS
OF MO' LINGUISH

10:24.017 --> 10:26.018
AND RETRAIN ALL THESE PEOPLE
TO SPEAK PROPERLY,

10:26.020 --> 10:28.008
THUS ELIMINATING
THE CIRCULAR PATTERN

10:28.010 --> 10:30.017

10:31.015 --> 10:33.002

10:33.004 --> 10:36.015
- I CAN THINK OF ONLY
ONE IN TOWNSVILLE

10:36.017 --> 10:38.004
WHO HAS THAT POWER.

10:38.006 --> 10:40.001
- NOW REPEAT AFTER ME.

10:40.003 --> 10:42.006
THE COLOR OF THE SKY IS...

10:42.008 --> 10:43.018
- BLUE.

10:43.020 --> 10:45.017
- THE COLOR OF THE GRASS IS...

10:45.019 --> 10:46.017
- GREEN.

10:46.019 --> 10:49.007
- THE STOP SIGN ON
THE STREET IS...

10:49.009 --> 10:50.018
- RED.

10:50.020 --> 10:51.027
- VERY GOOD.

10:51.029 --> 10:53.029
NOW, LET'S MOVE ON TO NUMBERS.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.011

10:55.013 --> 10:56.005
- 12.

10:56.007 --> 10:57.018
- WELL, THIS IS GOING WELL.

10:57.020 --> 11:00.008
- DO YOU THINK MOJO IS
REALLY LEARNING HIS LESSON?

11:00.010 --> 11:04.028
- OH, I THINK HE'S
LEARNING QUITE A BIT.

11:05.021 --> 11:08.004
- THE EASTER BUNNY HIDES...

11:08.006 --> 11:09.000
- EGGS,

11:09.002 --> 11:10.006
WHICH ARE GENERALLY REGULAR EGGS

11:10.008 --> 11:11.021
WHICH HAVE BEEN BOILED
IN THE HOTTEST OF WATER

11:11.023 --> 11:14.004
AND THEN DECORATED IN
A VINEGAR-BASED DYE

11:14.006 --> 11:15.003

11:15.005 --> 11:16.019

11:16.021 --> 11:17.020
- EGGS.

11:17.022 --> 11:19.023

THE DAY IS SAVED

11:19.025 --> 11:21.020
BECAUSE IT WAS A DAY THAT
WAS IN NEED OF BEING SAVED

11:21.022 --> 11:24.010

UNSAVED NATURE OF THE DAY.

AS THE NARRATOR, THAT IS
TO SAY TELLER OF THE STORY,

11:35.011 --> 11:37.007
I FEEL LIKE I MUST PROVIDE
A SNAPPY BUTTON,

12:50.004 --> 12:52.028
THIS IS ANOTHER GREAT
ACCIDENT YOU'VE CREATED.
