00:08:00.783 --> 00:08:02.851
Well, yes, but, uh...

00:08:02.987 --> 00:08:06.952
Mr. Wonka is temporarily
embarrassed.

00:08:07.088 --> 00:08:09.056
Oh, no. You don't say.

00:08:09.192 --> 00:08:10.992

Mrs. Scrubitt.

but you don't have to pay
till 6:00 tomorrow.

00:08:49.564 --> 00:08:51.644

to earn a few pennies?

00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:53.600
More than enough,
Mrs. Scrubitt.

00:08:53.735 --> 00:08:55.170
Thank you.

00:08:55.305 --> 00:08:57.708

- Who's that, then?
- The girl.

00:09:14.489 --> 00:09:16.458
- What girl?
- That girl. It sounded like,

00:09:16.594 --> 00:09:20.495
"Read the small print."
And there does seem to be a lot of...

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.230
Oh. Oh. Oh.

00:09:23.764 --> 00:09:25.898

00:09:28.438 --> 00:09:30.541
Yeah, you don't wanna listen

00:09:30.677 --> 00:09:32.441

- Damaged?

the laundry chute as a bab, and I took her in

00:09:40.852 --> 00:09:42.250
out the goodness
of my heart,

00:09:42.385 --> 00:09:44.318
and I've done my best,
Mr. Wonka, honest, I have,

00:09:44.453 --> 00:09:46.658
but she's been left

00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:49.054

everywhere.

00:09:49.189 --> 00:09:51.190

- I know.

00:09:51.326 --> 00:09:53.462

00:10:09.515 --> 00:10:10.781
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

00:10:10.916 --> 00:10:12.583
- Hello.
- Ah!

00:10:12.718 --> 00:10:13.986
Then welcome to Scrubitt's.

There's your four-poster,
and your sink plus soap,

00:10:22.864 --> 00:10:23.901

on your pillow.

00:10:46.953 --> 00:10:48.160
You know what you did,
you brat.

00:10:48.184 --> 00:10:49.624
- Stop squirming!
- What? No, please.

00:10:51.323 --> 00:10:53.336
You ever
interfere in my business again,

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.861
and you'll be in this coop all week.
Do you understand?

00:10:55.996 --> 00:10:58.896
Yes, Mrs. Scrubitt.
Sorry, Mrs. Scrubitt.

00:10:59.032 --> 00:11:01.827
I should think so, too.

00:11:30.257 --> 00:11:32.326

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:53.846
the likes of which
this world has never seen.

00:11:53.885 --> 00:11:56.588
So quiet up and listen down.

00:11:56.724 --> 00:11:58.521
No, scratch that, reverse it.

00:11:58.657 --> 00:12:00.424
I give to you

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.594
the Hoverchoc.

00:13:20.101 --> 00:13:21.268
Thank you.

00:13:21.404 --> 00:13:23.639
- Miss Bon-Bon?
- Yes, Mr. Slugworth.

00:13:23.774 --> 00:13:24.907
Call the police.

00:13:25.043 --> 00:13:26.439
Very good, sir.

00:13:26.575 --> 00:13:29.013
Well, who wants to try one?

00:13:29.149 --> 00:13:30.912
- Me, please!
- I will.

00:13:32.515 --> 00:13:34.652
- Mr. Slugworth, sir.
- 'Scuse me.

00:13:34.788 --> 00:13:35.886
Mr. Fickelgruber.

00:13:36.022 --> 00:13:37.917
And Mr. Prodnose.

00:13:38.053 --> 00:13:39.187
What an honor.

00:13:39.323 --> 00:13:40.686
Ever since
I was a little boy...

00:13:40.821 --> 00:13:42.796
That is quite a handshake.

00:13:42.931 --> 00:13:45.027
It's a business handshake,
Mr. Wonka.

00:13:45.162 --> 00:13:47.798
Lets people know
I mean business.

00:13:47.934 --> 00:13:49.265
- Huh...
- Now, come along.

00:13:49.401 --> 00:13:53.368
Let's try one of these
so-called Hoverchocs.

00:14:02.944 --> 00:14:04.750
Ooh.

00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:06.484
It's not just chocolate,
is it?

00:14:06.619 --> 00:14:08.448
There's...

00:14:08.583 --> 00:14:10.186
- marshmallow.
- That's right.

00:14:10.322 --> 00:14:12.317
Harvested from
the mallow marshes of Peru.

00:14:12.452 --> 00:14:14.586
And caramel.

00:14:14.721 --> 00:14:16.722
- But... but it's...
- Salted.

00:14:16.857 --> 00:14:19.624
With the bittersweet tears
of a Russian clown.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.730
And is that...

00:14:21.865 --> 00:14:23.068
Surely not?

00:14:23.536 --> 00:14:24.763
Cherry?

00:14:24.899 --> 00:14:26.445
Cherry-picked by
the pick of the cherry pickers

00:14:26.469 --> 00:14:28.269
from the Imperial Gardens
in Japan.

00:14:28.405 --> 00:14:31.703
Well, Mr. Wonka.

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:33.677
I've been in this business
a very long time,

00:14:33.813 --> 00:14:35.246
and I can safely say

00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:37.946
that of all the chocolate
I have ever tasted,

00:14:38.081 --> 00:14:39.980
this is without doubt

00:14:40.116 --> 00:14:43.248
the absolute 100% worst.

00:14:43.384 --> 00:14:44.650
Whoo!

00:14:44.785 --> 00:14:46.000
There we have it,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:14:46.024 --> 00:14:47.888
An endorsement from Mr...

00:14:48.023 --> 00:14:49.225
Wait. The worst?

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.961
We three
are the fiercest of rivals,

00:14:52.097 --> 00:14:53.525
and yet we agree on one thing.

00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:55.799
A good chocolate
should be simple.

00:14:55.934 --> 00:14:57.696
Plain. Uncomplicated.

00:14:57.832 --> 00:15:01.003
Whereas this, with all
its bells and whistles...

00:15:01.139 --> 00:15:03.001
Well, it's just...

00:15:03.136 --> 00:15:04.439
Weird.

00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:06.839
That's a shame.

00:15:06.974 --> 00:15:10.080
If you thought the chocolate was weird,

00:15:10.216 --> 00:15:12.018
you're gonna hate
what happens next.

00:15:12.853 --> 00:15:14.482
Hmm?

00:15:14.617 --> 00:15:16.552
What's happening?
Whoa, what's going on?

00:15:16.688 --> 00:15:18.399
That's the hoverfly.

00:15:18.423 --> 00:15:19.958
It's broken
out of its cocoon.

00:15:20.093 --> 00:15:21.958
It's flapping its wings
like billy-oh.

00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:25.863
My hair!
You mean a fly is doing this?

00:15:25.999 --> 00:15:27.330
Yes. But don't worry.

00:15:27.465 --> 00:15:29.345
- It'll be completely unharmed.
- Oh, thank you.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.033
In about 20 minutes,
it'll get tired

00:15:31.168 --> 00:15:32.702
and exit through your rear.

00:15:32.837 --> 00:15:34.305
You what?

00:15:34.441 --> 00:15:35.984
He means we're going to
fart them out of our botties!

00:15:36.008 --> 00:15:37.710
Yes, I know what he meant.

00:15:37.846 --> 00:15:39.046
You're off your rocker, Wonka!

00:15:39.142 --> 00:15:40.375
Who in their right mind

00:15:40.511 --> 00:15:42.015
wants a chocolate
that makes you fly?

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.386
Well, let's find out,
shall we?

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.184
Who's for a Hoverchoc?

00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:47.383
I want one!

00:15:47.518 --> 00:15:49.819
One sovereign, please.
Thank you.

00:15:49.955 --> 00:15:51.552
Thank you very much.

00:15:51.687 --> 00:15:53.827
One sovereign.
Thank you, madam.

00:15:53.962 --> 00:15:54.757
Enjoy your flight.

00:15:56.263 --> 00:15:58.130
Look, I'm flying!
I'm flying!

00:16:01.465 --> 00:16:03.003
How's the view
up there?

00:16:03.905 --> 00:16:06.468
Not too high, darling!

00:16:09.238 --> 00:16:10.471
Beat it, kid.

00:16:10.607 --> 00:16:12.839
All right, folks.
Nothin' to see here.

00:16:12.975 --> 00:16:16.781
Just a small group of people
defyin' the laws of gravity.

00:16:16.917 --> 00:16:18.349
- Yeah.
- Hook 'em, boys.

00:16:18.484 --> 00:16:20.289
That's the Hoverchoc,
sir. That's the point.

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:22.793
I'm afraid we've had
some complaints about you, sir.

00:16:22.856 --> 00:16:24.323
Complaints?

00:16:24.458 --> 00:16:26.135
That you're disrupting
the trade of other businesses.

00:16:26.159 --> 00:16:28.187
I'm regrettably obliged
to move you on

00:16:28.322 --> 00:16:29.928
and to confiscate

00:16:30.063 --> 00:16:31.528
your earnings.

00:16:31.663 --> 00:16:33.343
- Hey! What are you doing?
- No!

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:34.706
Don't worry,
it's going to a good cause.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.410
- Get off.
- Sick kids, or something.

00:16:36.464 --> 00:16:38.302
Sorry, sir. Rules is rules.

00:16:38.437 --> 00:16:39.843
Cheeky devil, you!
Come here!

00:16:39.867 --> 00:16:42.708
Could you at least
leave me a sovereign?

00:16:42.844 --> 00:16:44.374
I need to pay for my room.

00:16:47.343 --> 00:16:49.775
Here.

00:16:50.981 --> 00:16:52.184
Thank you.

00:16:55.717 --> 00:16:57.321
Evening, Mr. Wonka.

00:16:58.153 --> 00:16:59.288
How'd it go?

00:16:59.424 --> 00:17:00.953
Not quite as well
as I'd hoped.

00:17:01.089 --> 00:17:04.196
Oh, shame. Well, I'm afraid
we do have to settle up now.

00:17:04.332 --> 00:17:06.330
Well, thankfully,
the room's taken care of.

00:17:07.132 --> 00:17:08.667
Believe we said a sovereign.

00:17:08.802 --> 00:17:09.969
For the room, yes.

00:17:10.105 --> 00:17:12.800
But you have incurred
a few extras

00:17:12.935 --> 00:17:16.072
during the course of your
residency with ourselves.

00:17:16.207 --> 00:17:19.509
- Have I?
- Yes, you have.

00:17:19.644 --> 00:17:22.308
There was that glass of gin
you had on arrival,

00:17:22.444 --> 00:17:23.708
and if I remember rightly,

00:17:23.844 --> 00:17:26.280
you warmed your cockles
by the fire.

00:17:26.416 --> 00:17:27.913
He did indeed, Mrs. Scrubitt.

00:17:28.049 --> 00:17:30.420
Cockle-warming is extra, see?

00:17:30.555 --> 00:17:32.919
Used the stairs
to get to his room, and all.

00:17:33.055 --> 00:17:34.766
Oh, then
you've got your stair charge,

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.663
and that is per step,
I'm afraid. Up and down.

00:17:37.799 --> 00:17:39.163
Now, tell me, Mr. Wonka,

00:17:39.299 --> 00:17:41.634
did you happen
to use the mini bar?

00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:42.769
There's a minibar?

00:17:42.902 --> 00:17:43.902
Mini bar of soap.

00:17:44.034 --> 00:17:45.235
By the sink.

00:17:45.371 --> 00:17:47.439
- Uh... I might have, briefly.
- Oh-ho!

00:17:47.575 --> 00:17:49.695
See? Even Bleacher knows
you never touch the mini bar,

00:17:49.739 --> 00:17:51.777
and he was raised in a ditch.

00:17:51.913 --> 00:17:53.442
Add in your mattress hire,

00:17:53.578 --> 00:17:55.577
your linen lease,
and your pillow penalty,

00:17:55.712 --> 00:17:57.352
and you are looking at...

00:17:57.412 --> 00:17:59.116
Ten thousand sovereigns.

00:17:59.251 --> 00:18:00.527
You gotta be kidding me?

00:18:00.551 --> 00:18:02.956
It's all in the small print, dearie.

00:18:03.091 --> 00:18:04.349
I don't have
10,000 sovereigns.

00:18:05.753 --> 00:18:07.422
Then we have a problem,
Mr. Wonka.

00:18:07.558 --> 00:18:08.954
You're gonna
have to work it off

00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:10.808
in the Wash House, ain't ya?

00:18:10.832 --> 00:18:11.994
At a sovereign a day.

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.296
Ten thousand days is...

00:18:13.432 --> 00:18:14.572
Twenty-seven years.

00:18:14.596 --> 00:18:15.638
- Hey!
- Four months.

00:18:15.662 --> 00:18:17.368
And 16 days.

00:18:22.736 --> 00:18:24.971
Ah.

00:18:25.107 --> 00:18:27.673
- You must be Mr. Wonka.
- Who are you?

00:18:27.809 --> 00:18:31.078
Abacus Crunch,
chartered accountant.

00:18:31.213 --> 00:18:32.579
At least, I was.

00:18:32.715 --> 00:18:34.683
- Now, uh...
- He runs the place.

00:18:34.818 --> 00:18:37.186
And you best do as he says,
or you'll answer to me.

00:18:37.322 --> 00:18:39.190
Piper Benz. Plumber by trade.

00:18:39.326 --> 00:18:41.286
This is
Miss Lottie Bell.

00:18:41.422 --> 00:18:42.893
Hi.

00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:44.329
She don't talk much.

00:18:44.464 --> 00:18:48.095
And I'm Larry Chucklesworth!

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.096
Comedian.

00:18:49.232 --> 00:18:50.466
Hmm.

00:18:50.602 --> 00:18:52.082
So they got all of you, too,
did they?

00:18:52.137 --> 00:18:53.268
I'm afraid so.

00:18:53.404 --> 00:18:54.567
We each of us found ourselves

00:18:54.702 --> 00:18:56.174
in need of a cheap place
to stay,

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:58.807
and neglected
to read the small print.

00:18:58.942 --> 00:19:02.807
One moment of stupidity,
followed by endless regret.

00:19:02.943 --> 00:19:05.878
Sounds like my third marriage.

00:19:06.746 --> 00:19:08.282
I'm sorry, I do that a lot.

00:19:08.417 --> 00:19:09.715
- He does.
- A lot.

00:19:09.851 --> 00:19:11.350
I've only
been married once,

00:19:11.486 --> 00:19:12.885
and it didn't work out.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.535
There's gotta be
some way outta here.

00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:16.122
You don't think
we've tried?

00:19:16.257 --> 00:19:18.408
There are bars on the window
and there's a dog on the door.

00:19:18.432 --> 00:19:19.702
And even
if you could get out,

00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:21.935
that contract is watertight.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.444
If you're not here at roll call,
Mrs. Scrubitt will call the police,

00:19:24.468 --> 00:19:26.100
they'll bring you right back,

00:19:26.235 --> 00:19:27.851
and she'll charge you
a thousand for the inconvenience.

00:19:29.136 --> 00:19:30.517
All right, everybody.
Back to work.

00:19:30.541 --> 00:19:31.749
Come along, Mr. Wonka.

00:19:31.773 --> 00:19:34.373
You come with me.

00:19:34.509 --> 00:19:37.415
You're in here. On suds.

00:19:43.284 --> 00:19:44.654

And if you don't agree...

See clause five.

00:20:53.656 --> 00:20:56.661
- Section 7A.
- Paragraph 22.

00:20:56.797 --> 00:20:57.961
Part D.

00:20:58.097 --> 00:20:59.491

Room service.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.410
Told you to read
the small print.

00:21:45.476 --> 00:21:46.907
Slight problem with that.

00:21:48.379 --> 00:21:50.782
You can't read, can you?

00:21:50.918 --> 00:21:53.950
I focused my studies
almost exclusively on chocolate.

00:21:54.085 --> 00:21:56.119
I see.

00:21:56.254 --> 00:21:58.957
For everything else,
I've relied on the kindness of strangers.

00:21:59.092 --> 00:22:02.087
And look where that's got you.
The staff quarters.

00:22:03.063 --> 00:22:04.063
You've got a bed.

00:22:07.067 --> 00:22:09.068
You had a bed.

00:22:09.204 --> 00:22:13.170
Desk, and a wash basin/toilet.

00:22:13.306 --> 00:22:14.705
- Ugh.
- The water comes

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.271
in two temperatures. Cold...

00:22:17.407 --> 00:22:18.774
...and colder.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.913
How much do you owe them?

00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:23.381
Ten thousand.

00:22:23.517 --> 00:22:25.778
Count yourself lucky.
I owe 30.

00:22:25.914 --> 00:22:27.882
What? How do you
owe them money?

00:22:28.017 --> 00:22:30.119
I thought they found you
down a laundry chute.

00:22:30.255 --> 00:22:31.589
Oh, they did.

00:22:31.724 --> 00:22:33.371
Took me in out of the goodness
of their hearts

00:22:33.395 --> 00:22:35.521
and charged me
for the privilege.

00:22:35.657 --> 00:22:37.089
What a pair of monsters.

00:22:37.225 --> 00:22:40.464
The greedy beat the needy
every time, Mr. Wonka.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.233
Guess it's just
the way of the world.

00:22:42.368 --> 00:22:43.632
Oh, come on, Noodle.

00:22:43.768 --> 00:22:45.999
That's just your
Orphan Syndrome talking.

00:22:47.002 --> 00:22:49.068
- My what?
- Your Orphan Syndrome.

00:22:49.203 --> 00:22:52.472
And we are not gonna
be eating any slops.

00:22:52.608 --> 00:22:54.346
What are you doing?

00:22:54.482 --> 00:22:55.740
I'm making chocolate,
o' course.

00:22:55.876 --> 00:22:57.008
How do you like it? Dark?

00:22:57.144 --> 00:22:59.885
White? Nutty?
Absolutely insane?

00:23:00.021 --> 00:23:01.184
I don't know.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.049
I've never had any.

00:23:04.185 --> 00:23:06.751
You've never had chocolate?

00:23:06.887 --> 00:23:08.424
- No.
- What?

00:23:08.559 --> 00:23:10.023
You've never had chocolate?

00:23:10.624 --> 00:23:12.291
Still no.

00:23:12.427 --> 00:23:14.996
Well, this is unbelievable.
I mean, this is outrageous.

00:23:15.131 --> 00:23:16.995
Well, lucky for you, Noodle,
I have a selection

00:23:17.131 --> 00:23:18.634
of the world's
finest ingredients

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.435
right here
in my travel factory.

00:23:25.913 --> 00:23:26.913
Whoa.

00:23:27.009 --> 00:23:28.945
Where to begin?
That's the question.

00:23:29.081 --> 00:23:30.311
I know!

00:23:30.446 --> 00:23:31.514
Silver Linings.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.882
Made of condensed
thunder clouds

00:23:34.683 --> 00:23:36.984
and liquid sunlight.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.257
Helps you see
that faint ray o' hope

00:23:39.393 --> 00:23:41.191
beyond the shadow of despair.

00:23:41.326 --> 00:23:42.527
Just what we need,

00:23:42.662 --> 00:23:43.969
wouldn't you say?

00:23:43.993 --> 00:23:45.559
Did you always
wanna make chocolate?

00:23:45.694 --> 00:23:47.528
No.

00:23:47.664 --> 00:23:49.167
Back when I was your age,

00:23:49.303 --> 00:23:51.102
I wanted to be a magician.

00:23:51.237 --> 00:23:53.605
My mom was a cook.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.002
We lived on the river,
just the two of us.

00:23:56.138 --> 00:23:59.479
In a perfect little
world of our own.

00:24:01.407 --> 00:24:03.582
The way I remember it,
I used to spend

00:24:03.718 --> 00:24:05.079
every waking hour
trying to come up

00:24:05.214 --> 00:24:07.784
with some new trick
to impress my mom.

00:24:08.516 --> 00:24:10.886
Bravo!

00:24:11.022 --> 00:24:13.724
But the real magic
came from her.

00:24:15.488 --> 00:24:18.123
We didn't have a lotta money,
but each week,

00:24:18.258 --> 00:24:20.259
she brought home
one cocoa bean.

00:24:20.394 --> 00:24:22.164
And by the time my birthday
came around,

00:24:22.299 --> 00:24:24.867
there was enough to make
a single bar o' chocolate.

00:24:26.036 --> 00:24:28.634
But it wasn't
just any old chocolate.

00:24:28.769 --> 00:24:31.172
Far from it.

00:24:31.308 --> 00:24:33.907
This has to be the best chocolate
in the world.

00:24:34.043 --> 00:24:35.614
Oh,
don't know about that.

00:24:35.749 --> 00:24:37.909
They say the very best
comes from a place

00:24:38.044 --> 00:24:40.014
called the Galeries Gourmet.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:42.988
Theirs can't be any better
than yours, Mamma.

00:24:43.123 --> 00:24:44.419
It's impossible.

00:24:44.555 --> 00:24:47.687
Well, as it so happens,

00:24:47.823 --> 00:24:49.494
I do know a little secret

00:24:49.629 --> 00:24:52.092
that even
those fancy-pants don't.

00:24:53.133 --> 00:24:54.133
What is it?

00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:55.360
I'll tell ya.

00:24:55.495 --> 00:24:58.670
When you're older.
Now get to sleep.

00:25:04.938 --> 00:25:06.441
We should go, Amma.

00:25:06.577 --> 00:25:07.940
Where's that, then?

00:25:08.076 --> 00:25:10.041
- To the Galeries Gourmet.
- What?

00:25:10.176 --> 00:25:12.046
- And start a shop?
- Yeah.

00:25:12.181 --> 00:25:14.749
With our name above the door
and everything.

00:25:14.885 --> 00:25:17.084
That's a wonderful dream, honey.

00:25:17.785 --> 00:25:19.790
Is that all it is?

00:25:20.821 --> 00:25:22.628
Just a dream?

00:25:24.064 --> 00:25:25.158
Hey now.

00:25:28.067 --> 00:25:32.269
Every good thing in this world
started with a dream.

00:25:32.405 --> 00:25:34.333
So you hold on to yours.

00:25:34.468 --> 00:25:36.772
And when you do share
chocolate with the world,

00:25:36.907 --> 00:25:40.373
oh, I'll be right there
beside ya.

00:25:40.509 --> 00:25:41.377
Promise?

00:25:41.513 --> 00:25:42.611
Do better than that.

00:25:42.746 --> 00:25:45.211
I pinkie promise.

00:25:47.252 --> 00:25:48.415
Now,

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:49.754
sleep.

00:25:52.593 --> 00:25:55.089
So, what was it, Willy?

00:25:55.825 --> 00:25:57.791
What was the secret?

00:25:57.927 --> 00:25:59.731
I never found out.

00:26:00.897 --> 00:26:03.796
Soon after, she fell sick.

00:26:03.932 --> 00:26:07.673
And before I knew it,
all I had left was her bar of chocolate.

00:26:12.072 --> 00:26:14.107
That's why I'm here, Noodle.

00:26:14.243 --> 00:26:17.381
So I can feel the same way
I did back then,

00:26:17.517 --> 00:26:19.311
eating chocolate with her.

00:26:20.782 --> 00:26:22.550
What do you mean?

00:26:22.685 --> 00:26:25.063
My mom once promised that
when I share chocolate with the world,

00:26:25.087 --> 00:26:26.851
she'd be right there
beside me.

00:26:28.763 --> 00:26:30.859
I know it sounds crazy,
but I always hoped

00:26:30.995 --> 00:26:32.390
she'd somehow
keep that promise.

00:26:34.228 --> 00:26:36.669
She might even
tell me her secret.

00:26:42.738 --> 00:26:44.369
Here. Try one.

00:27:02.826 --> 00:27:04.925
Wish you hadn't done that.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.595
- You don't like it?
- No,

00:27:07.731 --> 00:27:10.296
I like it. It's just...

00:27:10.863 --> 00:27:12.665
What?

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:17.243
Now each day I don't have chocolate
will be a little harder.

00:27:17.378 --> 00:27:21.038
Then how would you like to have
all the chocolate you can eat, every day,

00:27:21.174 --> 00:27:22.577
for the rest of your life?

00:27:22.712 --> 00:27:23.743
A lifetime supply?

00:27:23.878 --> 00:27:26.218
A lifetime supply.

00:27:26.354 --> 00:27:27.354
What would I have to do?

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.015
Not much.
Just get me out of here.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.021
- Are you crazy?
- Shh!

00:27:31.156 --> 00:27:33.023
It's easy. I'll get someone
to cover my shift,

00:27:33.159 --> 00:27:34.772
and you could smuggle me out
in your laundry cart.

00:27:34.796 --> 00:27:36.069
- But I...
- Just for a few hours, mind.

00:27:36.093 --> 00:27:37.626
No one will even know
I was gone.

00:27:37.762 --> 00:27:39.260
What's the point of that?

00:27:39.396 --> 00:27:41.240
To sell chocolate, o' course!
We'll split the profits

00:27:41.264 --> 00:27:42.610
and pay off Mrs. Scrubitt
in no time.

00:27:42.634 --> 00:27:43.934
It's a nice idea, Willy.

00:27:44.069 --> 00:27:45.935
- It's a great idea.
- But it'll never work.

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:47.670
'Course it will.
Eat your chocolate.

00:27:47.806 --> 00:27:49.604
You don't understand.

00:27:49.739 --> 00:27:52.299
Mrs. Scrubitt's like a hawk.
She keeps her beady eye on everything

00:27:52.376 --> 00:27:55.011
that comes in and out
of the Wash House except...

00:27:55.842 --> 00:27:57.046
Huh.

00:27:57.647 --> 00:27:58.784
What is it?

00:27:59.419 --> 00:28:00.614
No, it's nothing.

00:28:00.749 --> 00:28:02.051
Oh, okay.

00:28:02.552 --> 00:28:03.688
Huh.

00:28:03.824 --> 00:28:05.187
Double-huh!
That's not nothing.

00:28:05.322 --> 00:28:06.970
That's the Silver Lining.
It's given you an idea.

00:28:06.994 --> 00:28:09.289
Okay. So, the one time
she dropped her guard

00:28:09.424 --> 00:28:11.256
was when this aristocrat
came to the laundry.

00:28:11.392 --> 00:28:13.225
He was only
asking for directions,

00:28:13.361 --> 00:28:15.465
but she was all over him
like a rash.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.829
It was disgusting.

00:28:16.964 --> 00:28:18.232
That's it, Noodle.

00:28:18.367 --> 00:28:19.849
All we have to do
is find an aristocrat

00:28:19.873 --> 00:28:21.602
and slip out
while she's distracted.

00:28:21.737 --> 00:28:23.237
Yeah, but...

00:28:23.372 --> 00:28:25.811
where are we going
to find an aristocrat?

00:28:28.677 --> 00:28:29.677
Huh.

00:28:29.744 --> 00:28:30.948
Huh?

00:28:31.746 --> 00:28:32.746
Huh.

00:28:32.848 --> 00:28:33.982
A double-huh.

00:28:34.118 --> 00:28:35.257
Do you have
a pencil and paper?

00:28:35.281 --> 00:28:37.988
- Uh-huh.
- I got an idea.

00:28:57.372 --> 00:28:59.476
I've come
to make a confession.

00:29:01.816 --> 00:29:04.278
You sound great, fellas.
Keep it up.

00:29:09.154 --> 00:29:11.549
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

00:29:13.357 --> 00:29:17.060
I have had 150 of these
since my last confession.

00:29:19.492 --> 00:29:22.362
Temptation is very hard
to resist.

00:29:25.668 --> 00:29:27.472
Mmm.

00:29:27.607 --> 00:29:29.072
Send me down.

00:29:30.174 --> 00:29:32.812
I'll see you later.

00:29:37.882 --> 00:29:39.819
Good evening, Chief.

00:29:40.587 --> 00:29:41.587
They're all waiting.

00:29:41.654 --> 00:29:43.053
Thank you very much.

00:29:45.124 --> 00:29:47.419
Good evening, gentlemen.
I've brought my invoice.

00:29:47.555 --> 00:29:51.527
One chocolatier moved on
for the usual fee.

00:29:51.663 --> 00:29:52.892
Oh.

00:29:53.027 --> 00:29:54.225
Here we go, baby.

00:29:54.361 --> 00:29:55.934
There's the good stuff. Yeah.

00:29:56.069 --> 00:29:57.807
- Tell me, Chief...
- Mm-hmm?

00:29:57.831 --> 00:29:59.866
...how would you like
to earn a few more of those?

00:30:00.002 --> 00:30:01.267
Oh, I am listening.

00:30:01.403 --> 00:30:03.074
We think
that Mr. Wonka

00:30:03.209 --> 00:30:07.041
might require a little more
than simply moving on.

00:30:07.176 --> 00:30:08.643
- Oh.
- He's good.

00:30:08.778 --> 00:30:09.809
Too good.

00:30:09.944 --> 00:30:11.112
And what's more,

00:30:11.248 --> 00:30:13.445
he only charges
a sovereign a chocolate.

00:30:13.581 --> 00:30:16.383
So anyone can afford them,
even the...

00:30:18.051 --> 00:30:19.790
You know, the...

00:30:19.926 --> 00:30:22.323
- The poor?
- Oh, dear.

00:30:22.459 --> 00:30:25.159
I've just been
a little bit sick in my mouth.

00:30:25.295 --> 00:30:26.863
Could you please refrain
from mentioning

00:30:26.999 --> 00:30:28.460
that demographic
in my presence?

00:30:28.596 --> 00:30:30.236
He doesn't like it
when people say "poor."

00:30:30.365 --> 00:30:32.101
Sorry, Felix.

00:30:32.236 --> 00:30:35.002
We want you to send
Wonka a message.

00:30:35.137 --> 00:30:37.242
Backed up by physical force.

00:30:37.377 --> 00:30:39.912
That if he attempts to sell
chocolate in this town again,

00:30:40.047 --> 00:30:43.448
he is liable to meet
with a little accident.

00:30:43.583 --> 00:30:46.048
In which he dies.

00:30:46.183 --> 00:30:47.503
Yeah, no, I...
I got that already.

00:30:47.614 --> 00:30:49.219
You don't have
to keep saying it.

00:30:49.354 --> 00:30:50.997
I'm just making sure
we're all on the same page.

00:30:51.021 --> 00:30:52.620
Well, no one's on your page.

00:30:52.756 --> 00:30:54.033
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, I know what it means...

00:30:54.057 --> 00:30:55.134
Actually, what does it mean?

00:30:55.158 --> 00:30:56.555
Gentlemen, please.

00:30:58.061 --> 00:30:59.728
So, what do you say, Chief?

00:30:59.863 --> 00:31:01.264
Do we have a deal?

00:31:01.399 --> 00:31:04.168
Well, listen, fellas,
I'm an officer of the law.

00:31:04.303 --> 00:31:07.566
I can't just go around
roughin' up your competition.

00:31:08.706 --> 00:31:09.909
I'm sorry.

00:31:10.675 --> 00:31:12.110
Well now, Chief.

you're a man of integrity.

00:37:38.094 --> 00:37:39.530
What?

00:37:39.666 --> 00:37:41.339
The Little Orange Man.
I didn't tell you about him?

00:37:41.363 --> 00:37:43.134
No, ya didn't.

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:45.302
He's my nemesis.
About yea high.

00:37:45.438 --> 00:37:46.638
Comes in the dead
of the night,

00:37:46.703 --> 00:37:48.466
and he steals
all my chocolate.

00:37:48.601 --> 00:37:51.202
Been happening every few weeks
for the past three, four years now.

00:37:51.338 --> 00:37:52.338
Really?

00:37:52.408 --> 00:37:53.741
Sometimes I spy him

00:37:53.877 --> 00:37:55.841
in that strange realm
'twixt sleep and wake,

00:37:55.977 --> 00:37:57.474
green hair glinting
in the moonlight.

00:37:57.609 --> 00:37:58.810
Green hair?

00:37:58.945 --> 00:38:00.347
One day I shall
catch him, Noodle.

00:38:00.483 --> 00:38:01.483
- Willy.
- When I do...

00:38:01.548 --> 00:38:03.049
- Willy!
- Hmm?

00:38:03.185 --> 00:38:05.227
You don't seriously expect me
to believe this, do you?

00:38:05.251 --> 00:38:07.484
Of course I do. What other
explanation is there?

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:08.621
I don't know,

00:38:08.756 --> 00:38:10.294
- that you go to sleep...
- Mm-hmm.

00:38:10.429 --> 00:38:11.603
...dream 'bout
Little Green Man...

00:38:11.627 --> 00:38:12.736
Orange man, green hair. Yeah.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.066
...and while you're dreaming,

00:38:14.201 --> 00:38:15.866
stuff your face
with chocolate!

00:38:16.001 --> 00:38:17.369
Stuff my...

00:38:18.237 --> 00:38:19.357
That makes a lot more sense.

00:38:19.471 --> 00:38:20.831
Why'd I ever think
this would work?

00:38:20.903 --> 00:38:22.618
I've been eating
all my own chocolate?

00:38:22.642 --> 00:38:23.168
- Stupid Silver Linings.
- I don't think I have been.

00:38:23.304 --> 00:38:24.607
Hey!

00:38:24.742 --> 00:38:25.982
There's nothing stupid
about my chocolate.

00:38:26.006 --> 00:38:28.211
If Mrs. Scrubitt
had spotted us,

00:38:28.347 --> 00:38:29.948
I'd be in the coop right now.

00:38:30.083 --> 00:38:31.281
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

00:38:31.416 --> 00:38:32.976
But we can make
more chocolate.

00:38:33.112 --> 00:38:35.416
Only problem is
I'm all out of milk.

00:38:35.551 --> 00:38:37.587
Well, that's not a problem.

00:38:38.222 --> 00:38:40.155
Milk.

00:38:40.291 --> 00:38:42.221
A, that is stealing.

00:38:42.356 --> 00:38:43.626
And C,

00:38:43.761 --> 00:38:45.657
Willy Wonka does not use
any old cow's milk.

00:38:45.793 --> 00:38:46.953
For this particular creation,

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.394
I require the milk
of a giraffe.

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:51.029
Okay... fine.

00:38:51.164 --> 00:38:53.000
As a matter of fact,
there's one at the zoo.

00:38:53.136 --> 00:38:54.271
Bingala!

00:38:54.406 --> 00:38:56.400
But A,
the zoo is not that way.

00:38:56.535 --> 00:38:57.676
Great.

00:38:57.811 --> 00:38:59.138
And B,

00:38:59.274 --> 00:39:01.909
they're not gonna let you just
walk in there and milk it.

00:39:02.044 --> 00:39:05.681
Mm. That, my dear Noodle,
is why we're very lucky

00:39:05.816 --> 00:39:08.651
the Little Orange Man
didn't find this.

00:39:13.256 --> 00:39:14.256
What is it?

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.558
From Zoo Management.

00:39:15.693 --> 00:39:18.857
In recognition
of your years of service.

00:39:18.993 --> 00:39:20.762
But I've only
been here a year.

00:39:21.964 --> 00:39:25.437
Which is why
there's only one chocolate.

00:39:26.202 --> 00:39:27.368
Huh.

00:39:27.504 --> 00:39:28.801
Well, thank you very much.

00:39:28.937 --> 00:39:30.904
You're welcome.
Good night!

00:39:32.511 --> 00:39:33.683
Hey, well done, Noodle.

00:39:33.707 --> 00:39:35.641
So, what is it really?

00:39:35.776 --> 00:39:37.449
It's called A Big Night Out.

00:39:37.584 --> 00:39:38.956
A single chocolate
that perfectly mimics

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.648
- a night on the town.
- Mmm.

00:39:40.784 --> 00:39:43.219
The outer layer,
a champagne truffle.

00:39:43.354 --> 00:39:44.387
That's lovely.

00:39:44.522 --> 00:39:46.090
The next is white wine.

00:39:46.225 --> 00:39:47.225
Mmm.

00:39:47.259 --> 00:39:48.259
Followed by red.

00:39:48.393 --> 00:39:49.924
Now we are talking!

00:39:50.059 --> 00:39:52.007
That's when the singing
and dancing starts.

00:39:52.031 --> 00:39:54.493
♪ We're gonna
Have a party tonight! ♪

00:39:54.629 --> 00:39:57.569
It's when he hits the layer
o' whiskey fudge he'll get emotional.

00:39:57.704 --> 00:40:00.063
She was
the only woman I ever loved!

00:40:00.199 --> 00:40:02.338
He might do
something reckless.

00:40:02.474 --> 00:40:03.671
I'll give her a call.

00:40:03.807 --> 00:40:06.243
What harm could it do?

00:40:06.378 --> 00:40:08.172
Hello, Gwennie? It's Basil.

00:40:08.308 --> 00:40:10.642
I just wanted to say,
I've always loved you.

00:40:10.778 --> 00:40:12.950
I love you so much. What?

00:40:13.085 --> 00:40:14.319
It's Basil Bond.

00:40:14.455 --> 00:40:15.791
We sat together
in chemistry at school.

00:40:15.815 --> 00:40:17.514
No, no, don't hang up!

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:20.454
Finally, some old port
from the back of the cupboard, and...

00:40:23.194 --> 00:40:24.194
Hmm.

00:40:24.263 --> 00:40:26.195
Let's go.

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:27.631
Noodle, let's go.

00:40:29.766 --> 00:40:31.396
Why don't they
fly away?

00:40:31.532 --> 00:40:34.539
I don't know.
Perhaps they haven't thought of it.

00:40:34.674 --> 00:40:36.594
- You're kidding?
- No, I'm serious.

00:40:36.706 --> 00:40:38.135
That's the thing
about flamingos.

00:40:38.271 --> 00:40:40.274
They need someone
to show 'em the way.

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:41.612
Huh.

00:40:45.515 --> 00:40:46.848
Giraffe.

00:40:47.615 --> 00:40:50.885
Giraffe. Giraffe.

00:40:52.388 --> 00:40:53.921
Ah! Giraffe.

00:40:59.863 --> 00:41:01.766
You have got to learn
how to read.

00:41:01.902 --> 00:41:02.902
Why?

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:04.534
You were nearly
eaten by a tiger.

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:06.110
"Nearly" is the key word
there, Noodle.

00:41:06.134 --> 00:41:07.774
I've nearly been eaten
by a lot of things,

00:41:07.838 --> 00:41:09.906
and none of them
got more than a nibble.

00:41:11.505 --> 00:41:12.804
Giraffe.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.579
Okay, I'll learn how to read.

00:41:34.227 --> 00:41:38.062
Good evening,
Miss, um...

00:41:38.198 --> 00:41:39.971
- Abigail.
- Abigail.

00:41:40.867 --> 00:41:42.502
Whoa! Easy, now.

00:41:42.638 --> 00:41:44.136
I brought acacia mints.

00:41:50.676 --> 00:41:52.011
Oh.

00:41:52.147 --> 00:41:54.980
Giraffes are just crazy
about my acacia mints.

00:41:55.116 --> 00:41:56.753
Love 'em more
than anything else.

00:41:56.888 --> 00:41:58.953
Except being scratched
under the chin, you see?

00:42:01.695 --> 00:42:03.138
You wanna
give it a go, Noodle?

00:42:03.162 --> 00:42:04.459
Me?

00:42:04.594 --> 00:42:06.092
Yeah. Why not?

00:42:07.563 --> 00:42:08.897
Okay.

00:42:14.033 --> 00:42:15.165
- Ugh!
- Oh!

00:42:15.301 --> 00:42:17.741
Think she likes you.

00:42:18.904 --> 00:42:20.778
Miss Abigail,

00:42:20.913 --> 00:42:23.142
if my colleague here
gives you a good scratch,

00:42:23.277 --> 00:42:24.837
do you think you could
possibly spare us

00:42:24.945 --> 00:42:26.585
a pint or two of your milk?

00:42:31.252 --> 00:42:34.054
So, have you done
this before?

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:36.424
Once. In Africa.

00:42:36.559 --> 00:42:38.629
Magnificent beast.

00:42:38.764 --> 00:42:40.925
- Was she wild?
- Wild?

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.433
She was absolutely furious.

00:42:43.569 --> 00:42:45.129
You sure can be silly, Willy.

00:42:45.264 --> 00:42:47.698
I suppose that's true-dle,
Noodle.

00:42:47.833 --> 00:42:49.439
True-dle?

00:42:49.574 --> 00:42:50.935
That doesn't work, does it?

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:52.642
Nothing rhymes with Noodle.

00:42:52.777 --> 00:42:55.244
Where'd you get that name, anyway?

00:42:55.379 --> 00:42:56.379
Doesn't matter.

00:42:57.249 --> 00:42:58.249
No, go on.

00:43:01.188 --> 00:43:02.188
This.

00:43:03.624 --> 00:43:06.216
It's all I have
of my real parents. See?

00:43:06.351 --> 00:43:10.189
"N" for Noodle.
Or Nora, or Nina,

00:43:11.022 --> 00:43:12.890
or nothing at all.

00:43:13.026 --> 00:43:14.464
Can't you trace the owner?

00:43:14.599 --> 00:43:16.063
You don't think I've tried?

00:43:16.995 --> 00:43:18.834
When I was a kid,

00:43:18.969 --> 00:43:22.073
I always hoped
that I'd find my parents.

00:43:22.208 --> 00:43:25.876
And they'd live in this
beautiful old building full of books.

00:43:26.012 --> 00:43:29.841
My mom, she'd be waiting there
for me at the door,

00:43:29.977 --> 00:43:31.476
and I'd run into her arms.

00:43:31.612 --> 00:43:34.950
She'd give me this big hug
like she'd never let me go.

00:43:37.253 --> 00:43:39.889
But then I realized
it was just a stupid dream.

00:43:42.322 --> 00:43:44.493
There's nothing stupid
about that.

00:43:44.628 --> 00:43:46.161
Isn't there?

00:43:46.297 --> 00:43:48.663
I know things haven't
been easy for you, Noodle.

00:43:48.799 --> 00:43:50.297
But they're gonna get better.

00:43:50.433 --> 00:43:53.467
I'm not gonna let you rot
in that Wash House forever.

00:43:53.602 --> 00:43:54.701
You promise?

00:43:54.837 --> 00:43:56.807
I can do better than that.

00:43:57.904 --> 00:43:59.238
I pinkie promise.

00:43:59.373 --> 00:44:01.740
And that's the most
solemn vow there is.

00:44:04.745 --> 00:44:06.380
Get scratchin'.

00:44:06.516 --> 00:44:10.015
We don't have long
until that guard comes to-dle, Noodle.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:13.021
- To-dle!
- It's not even a word!

00:44:13.489 --> 00:44:14.524
Oh.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.358

Certainly, Officer.

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:20.916

- Are you sure, sir?

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:23.441
Oh, yeah.
This is between me and Mr. Wonka.

00:47:23.577 --> 00:47:25.092
You better
get outta here, Noodle.

00:47:25.116 --> 00:47:26.590
- But Willy...
- Don't worry about me.

00:47:26.614 --> 00:47:28.062
I've talked my way out
of tighter spots than this.

00:47:28.086 --> 00:47:29.286
I'll meet you
back at the cart.

00:47:30.485 --> 00:47:32.689
Now, Officer,
if this is about Abigail...

00:47:32.825 --> 00:47:34.292
I got a message for you, pal.

00:47:34.427 --> 00:47:35.151
Whoa! No.

00:47:36.622 --> 00:47:40.191
Do not sell chocolate
in this town!

00:47:40.327 --> 00:47:42.197
You got it?

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:44.969
Not really, I'm afraid.

00:47:45.104 --> 00:47:47.833
Oh, so you got a mouth on you,
huh, Candy Man?

00:47:47.968 --> 00:47:49.303
I said...

00:47:49.439 --> 00:47:52.275
Don't sell chocolate!

00:47:53.646 --> 00:47:55.072
You hear me that time?

00:47:55.208 --> 00:47:57.179
I have water in my ears.

00:47:57.746 --> 00:47:58.746
Oh.

00:47:58.849 --> 00:48:00.717
Yeah, that... You've...

00:48:00.853 --> 00:48:02.816
Okay, that makes sense. Yeah.

00:48:02.951 --> 00:48:04.917
Listen, I'm sorry.

00:48:05.053 --> 00:48:06.791
I'm all outta whack.

00:48:06.926 --> 00:48:09.453
Truth is, I don't wanna
be doin' this.

00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:11.257
I don't want you
to be doing this.

00:48:11.393 --> 00:48:13.028
But I still gotta
give ya a message.

00:48:13.163 --> 00:48:15.197
Sell chocolate
in this town again,

00:48:15.332 --> 00:48:17.835
you're gonna get more
than a bonk on the head.

00:48:17.971 --> 00:48:19.403
I don't have
a bonk on the head.

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.601
What is with me today? I...

00:48:23.736 --> 00:48:25.471
- Can you give me just a second?
- Sure.

00:48:28.673 --> 00:48:30.479
Lord Bleachowitz.

00:48:30.615 --> 00:48:34.518
Mrs. Scrubitt.
Your eyes are like two rabbit droppings

00:48:34.654 --> 00:48:35.687
in a couple of bowls

00:48:35.822 --> 00:48:37.120
- of custard.
- Oh!

00:48:37.255 --> 00:48:39.000
You really do have a way
with words.

00:48:39.024 --> 00:48:40.787
See you downstairs.

00:48:40.922 --> 00:48:42.790
Geronimo!

00:48:42.926 --> 00:48:44.696
Ah, Mr. Wonka.

00:48:44.831 --> 00:48:46.360
Good of you to join us.

00:48:46.495 --> 00:48:48.732
- Not late, am I?
- Well, no.

00:48:48.868 --> 00:48:50.231
Cutting it a bit fine, but...

00:48:50.366 --> 00:48:51.707
Has Tiddles been
pulling his weight?

00:48:51.731 --> 00:48:53.046
As a matter of fact,

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:54.313
Tiddles has been
a very good boy,

00:48:54.337 --> 00:48:56.170
and productivity is up 30%.

00:48:56.305 --> 00:48:57.633
We took
the afternoon off.

00:48:57.769 --> 00:48:59.082
But that's not the point.

00:48:59.106 --> 00:49:00.270
This is the point.

00:49:00.406 --> 00:49:01.743
- Not now, Larry.
- Sorry.

00:49:01.879 --> 00:49:03.514
The point is...

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:04.650
Where have you been?

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:07.478
And why do you smell
of giraffe?

00:49:07.614 --> 00:49:09.117
Guess I owe you guys
an explanation.

00:49:09.253 --> 00:49:11.017
- Mm.
- The truth is,

00:49:11.152 --> 00:49:12.550
I'm a chocolate maker.

00:49:12.686 --> 00:49:15.721
Not just any chocolate.
The best in the world.

00:49:15.857 --> 00:49:18.628
Ah, well, Noodle's flattering me,
but she's right.

00:49:18.763 --> 00:49:20.164
They're exquisite.

00:49:20.299 --> 00:49:23.000
Plan is to sell chocolate
and pay off Mrs. Scrubitt.

00:49:23.136 --> 00:49:25.162
At least,
that was the plan, until...

00:49:25.297 --> 00:49:26.665
Oh, let me guess.

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:30.003
You had a little run-in
with the Chief of Police?

00:49:30.138 --> 00:49:31.337
How do you know that?

00:49:31.473 --> 00:49:34.337
Because I was
Slugworth's accountant.

00:49:34.472 --> 00:49:36.112
For a week, at least.

00:49:36.247 --> 00:49:37.907
His regular bookkeeper
was off sick.

00:49:38.042 --> 00:49:39.842
- Station, please.
- And I was called

00:49:39.913 --> 00:49:42.181
halfway across the country
to take his place.

00:49:42.316 --> 00:49:44.119
Good evening, Mr. Slugworth.

00:49:44.255 --> 00:49:47.022
I just need
your signature on...

00:49:47.157 --> 00:49:48.952
Seemed a straightforward job.

00:49:49.088 --> 00:49:50.088
Oh.

00:49:50.224 --> 00:49:52.225
Until I realized

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:54.831
there were two sets of books.

00:49:54.966 --> 00:49:56.966
One for the authorities,

00:49:57.101 --> 00:49:59.862
and one which told the truth.

00:49:59.998 --> 00:50:03.634
Slugworth, Fickelgruber,
and Prodnose

00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:05.671
have been in cahoots
for years.

00:50:05.806 --> 00:50:08.476
A sort of chocolate cartel,
if you will.

00:50:08.612 --> 00:50:10.576
They've been watering down
their chocolate

00:50:10.712 --> 00:50:13.378
and storing the excess
in a secret vault

00:50:13.513 --> 00:50:15.351
deep beneath the cathedral,

00:50:15.486 --> 00:50:18.184
guarded round the clock
by a corrupt cleric

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:22.425
and 500 chocoholic monks.

00:50:22.561 --> 00:50:26.395
The only way in is down
a secret elevator, and past

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:28.693
the Mistress of the Keys.

00:50:28.829 --> 00:50:30.728
A subterranean sentinel...

00:50:30.864 --> 00:50:33.071
...who hasn't seen
sunlight in years.

00:50:33.206 --> 00:50:34.701
Good evening.

00:50:34.837 --> 00:50:36.583
There's thousands
of gallons of chocolate

00:50:36.607 --> 00:50:39.737
down there, and the Cartel
use it to bribe,

00:50:39.873 --> 00:50:42.910
blackmail, and bludgeon
the competition.

00:50:43.046 --> 00:50:45.361
I do not care that they were school children...

00:50:45.385 --> 00:50:47.914
...they were in our way.
Next time, put your foot down.

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:49.351
Miss Bon-Bon?

00:50:49.486 --> 00:50:50.992
Good morning, Mr. Slugworth.

00:50:51.016 --> 00:50:53.516
From now on, I'll be keeping
the ledger in the vault.

00:50:53.652 --> 00:50:55.126
Very good, sir.

00:50:56.422 --> 00:50:57.656
Oh, and Mr. Crunch?

00:50:59.257 --> 00:51:00.257
Yes?

00:51:00.326 --> 00:51:01.792
You're fired.

00:51:03.933 --> 00:51:05.136
Very good, sir.

00:51:06.467 --> 00:51:08.372
I'm sorry, Mr. Wonka,

00:51:08.508 --> 00:51:11.441
but they've got you
right where they want you.

00:51:11.577 --> 00:51:14.070
You can't get a shop
without selling chocolate,

00:51:14.205 --> 00:51:18.113
and you can't sell chocolate
without a shop.

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.146
Hey, Noodle!

00:51:22.282 --> 00:51:23.884
Noodle! Psst!

00:51:25.518 --> 00:51:26.656
What is it, Willy?

00:51:26.791 --> 00:51:27.854
Watch out.

00:51:27.989 --> 00:51:28.989
Whoa!

00:51:34.425 --> 00:51:35.859
What's this for?

00:51:35.994 --> 00:51:39.496
Your wages.
A lifetime supply, remember?

00:51:39.631 --> 00:51:41.237
You didn't have to do that.

00:51:41.372 --> 00:51:44.142
Of course I did.
I gave you my word.

00:51:44.843 --> 00:51:46.739
Well, thanks.

00:51:46.875 --> 00:51:49.543
- I've got something for you, too.
- For me?

00:51:55.413 --> 00:51:56.481
What's this?

00:51:56.617 --> 00:51:59.383
- Glass half full?
- Other way up.

00:51:59.519 --> 00:52:01.058
Glass half empty.

00:52:01.193 --> 00:52:03.387
It's an "A."
Your first letter.

00:52:03.523 --> 00:52:05.629
I'm teaching you to read.

00:52:05.764 --> 00:52:07.224
Oh, Noodle.

00:52:07.359 --> 00:52:09.436
Well, I can't have
my business partner eaten by a tiger.

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:11.196
Or nearly eaten.

00:52:11.332 --> 00:52:12.999
So we're still partners?

00:52:13.134 --> 00:52:15.431
Sure, but I don't know
how we're gonna sell any chocolate.

00:52:15.567 --> 00:52:18.572
Every time the police show up,
you'd have to vanish into thin air.

00:52:19.107 --> 00:52:20.204
Like a magician.

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:21.608
Right!

00:52:21.743 --> 00:52:23.610
Yeah, but it's one thing
when you're onstage.

00:52:23.745 --> 00:52:26.347
You have ropes and pulleys
and trapdoors.

00:52:26.483 --> 00:52:27.824
There's none of those
on the street.

00:52:27.848 --> 00:52:29.714
As a matter of fact,
there are.

00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:32.021
There are trapdoors
all over the city.

00:52:32.156 --> 00:52:33.684
They're called storm drains.

00:52:33.819 --> 00:52:35.124
I'd be happy
to show you around

00:52:35.259 --> 00:52:36.557
if you cut me in
on the action.

00:52:36.692 --> 00:52:38.305
If you're recruiting,

00:52:38.329 --> 00:52:39.896
I'd do anything
to get out of here

00:52:40.032 --> 00:52:41.264
and make up with my wife.

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:43.795
I don't have
any practical skills, but,

00:52:43.931 --> 00:52:46.502
I can talk
like I'm under water.

00:52:46.637 --> 00:52:49.101
And if you need someone
to handle communications,

00:52:49.236 --> 00:52:50.806
I'm your woman.

00:52:50.941 --> 00:52:52.603
Lottie?

00:52:52.739 --> 00:52:54.341
What? Why you all
staring at me?

00:52:54.476 --> 00:52:56.379
I did not know
she could speak.

00:52:56.514 --> 00:52:58.613
- I thought you were a mime.
- No,

00:52:58.748 --> 00:53:01.584
I actually used to work
at the telephone exchange.

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:04.481
But back then,
I was quite the chatterbox.

00:53:04.616 --> 00:53:06.224
But since I came here,

00:53:07.359 --> 00:53:08.886
I haven't had much
to chat about.

00:53:09.022 --> 00:53:10.733
Far be it from me

00:53:10.757 --> 00:53:12.726
to pour cold water
on all your fun,

00:53:12.862 --> 00:53:15.331
but if Mrs. Scrubitt
catches you trying to escape,

00:53:15.467 --> 00:53:18.131
you'll all get six months
in the coop.

00:53:18.267 --> 00:53:19.700
So just think about that

00:53:19.835 --> 00:53:22.601
before getting involved
in this harebrained scheme.

00:53:22.736 --> 00:53:25.109
But it's not harebrained,
Abacus.

00:53:25.244 --> 00:53:27.236
Willy's chocolates
are incredible.

00:53:27.372 --> 00:53:28.707
Try one.

00:53:28.843 --> 00:53:30.443
That's very kind
of you, Noodle.

00:53:30.482 --> 00:53:33.251
I don't care how good
his chocolates are.

00:53:34.887 --> 00:53:36.320
When do we start?

00:53:47.325 --> 00:53:49.525
I guess what I'm trying
to say, Barbara, is, um,

00:53:49.567 --> 00:53:52.032
- will you marry me?
- Oh.

00:53:52.167 --> 00:53:53.569
I dunno, Colin.

00:53:53.704 --> 00:53:55.217
You're a lovely man,
but I'm looking for someone

00:53:55.241 --> 00:53:56.549
to sweep me off my feet.
You know,

00:53:56.573 --> 00:53:59.238
whisk me off
to a life of adventure.

00:53:59.373 --> 00:54:00.806
Could that be you?

00:54:01.606 --> 00:54:03.039
- No.
- Oh.

00:54:03.174 --> 00:54:05.711
Not with my chronic
lack of self-confidence.

00:54:05.847 --> 00:54:08.451
- Uh, I best be off.
- Oh, but Colin...

00:54:08.586 --> 00:54:10.552
Sorry to have
wasted your time, Barbara.

00:54:10.988 --> 00:54:12.455
Uh, taxi!

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:20.010
Uh, monsieur,
can I help you?

00:54:20.096 --> 00:54:21.761
Oh, waiter.

00:54:21.896 --> 00:54:24.761

I want a man on every

00:58:36.848 --> 00:58:38.382
Are you sure, sir?

00:58:38.518 --> 00:58:40.602
Shouldn't we be focusing on
all those unsolved murders?

00:58:40.626 --> 00:58:42.487
No, no, no, no,
this is the priority.

00:58:42.623 --> 00:58:43.858
Okay.

00:58:48.097 --> 00:58:49.971

I'm gonna need your help up.

00:58:49.995 --> 00:58:51.194
Yep, there we go.

00:58:51.329 --> 00:58:52.889
Pretty sure I've gained
about 150 pounds

00:58:52.997 --> 00:58:54.264
in the last two weeks.

00:59:27.305 --> 00:59:28.305
Ooh!

00:59:58.536 --> 01:00:00.733
Gotcha!

01:00:00.869 --> 01:00:02.134
What the devil?

01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:04.706
Let me out of here.
I demand to be released.

01:00:04.842 --> 01:00:06.710
Incredible.
It can speak.

01:00:06.845 --> 01:00:08.218
Well,
of course I can speak.

01:00:08.242 --> 01:00:09.882
Now let me out of here,
or I shall shriek.

01:00:09.944 --> 01:00:11.682
- Wow.
- Let me out!

01:00:11.817 --> 01:00:14.245
Not until I take
a good look at you.

01:00:15.818 --> 01:00:17.087
Wow.

01:00:17.223 --> 01:00:18.448
Good evening.

01:00:18.584 --> 01:00:20.854
So you're the funny little man
who's been following me.

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:23.292
"Funny little man"?
How dare you.

01:00:23.428 --> 01:00:24.661
I will have you know

01:00:24.797 --> 01:00:26.321
that I am a perfectly
respectable size

01:00:26.457 --> 01:00:28.330
for an Oompa Loompa.

01:00:28.465 --> 01:00:30.233
An Oompa-what-now?

01:00:30.368 --> 01:00:32.899
In fact, in Loompaland,
I am regarded as something of a whopper.

01:00:33.035 --> 01:00:34.738
They call me Lofty.

01:00:34.873 --> 01:00:36.738
So, I will thank you
to stop gawping at me

01:00:36.874 --> 01:00:38.148
as though I was
something unpleasant

01:00:38.172 --> 01:00:39.452
you'd found
in your handkerchief.

01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:43.213
I find it uncomfortable
and, frankly, rude.

01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:44.481
Um...

01:00:44.616 --> 01:00:45.936
- Sorry.
- Now let me out of here.

01:00:45.979 --> 01:00:47.718
You have absolutely no right

01:00:47.853 --> 01:00:50.153
to go around
embottling innocent strangers.

01:00:50.288 --> 01:00:51.481
Innocent?

01:00:51.616 --> 01:00:53.785
Hold on, you've been
stealing from me. For years.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.486
Well, you started it.

01:00:55.622 --> 01:00:56.622
Me?

01:00:56.693 --> 01:00:58.857
You stole our cocoa beans.

01:00:58.992 --> 01:01:01.391
What are you talking about?

01:01:01.526 --> 01:01:04.563
Do you mean
that you don't even remember?

01:01:04.699 --> 01:01:06.402
Remember what?

01:01:06.538 --> 01:01:08.365
The day you...

01:01:09.267 --> 01:01:11.066
destroyed my life.

01:01:11.202 --> 01:01:13.508
No, I don't remember that.

01:01:13.643 --> 01:01:14.742
Well then, young man.

01:01:14.877 --> 01:01:16.439
Allow me
to refresh your memory

01:01:16.574 --> 01:01:19.715
in the form of a song
so ruinously catchy

01:01:19.851 --> 01:01:21.746
that it may never
leave your mind.

01:01:23.151 --> 01:01:24.358
Oh, I don't think
I wanna hear that.

01:01:24.382 --> 01:01:25.698
Too late.

01:01:25.722 --> 01:01:27.021

01:02:49.902 --> 01:02:51.105
All right.

01:02:52.506 --> 01:02:55.373
Ah, thank you.
Now, would you be so very kind

01:02:55.508 --> 01:02:58.380

01:02:58.516 --> 01:02:59.649

01:02:59.784 --> 01:03:01.812

- There we are.

01:03:13.325 --> 01:03:14.625
Ow!

01:03:17.435 --> 01:03:18.435
Ow!

01:03:18.497 --> 01:03:20.603
Oompa Loompas
do not negotiate.

01:03:20.739 --> 01:03:21.779
Good day, sir.

01:03:21.872 --> 01:03:23.273
But that's my last jar!

01:03:23.408 --> 01:03:25.469
I said good day.

01:03:27.813 --> 01:03:29.474
He came back?

01:03:29.609 --> 01:03:31.713
Yes, Noodle,
but this time I set a trap.

01:03:31.848 --> 01:03:33.312
And he walked right into it.

01:03:33.913 --> 01:03:35.348
So, where is he?

01:03:35.484 --> 01:03:37.294
Ah, well, we had
a fight, you see. He won.

01:03:37.318 --> 01:03:38.718
Hit me on the head
with a frying pan

01:03:38.823 --> 01:03:40.017
and jumped out of the window.

01:03:40.153 --> 01:03:42.321
Of course he did.

01:03:43.223 --> 01:03:44.789
You don't believe me, do you?

01:03:44.925 --> 01:03:46.261
Honestly? No.

01:03:46.397 --> 01:03:47.397
No!

01:03:47.497 --> 01:03:48.223
No.

01:03:48.359 --> 01:03:50.232
- No.
- Definitely not.

01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:51.093
But,

01:03:51.228 --> 01:03:52.967
as it so happens,

01:03:53.103 --> 01:03:54.700
we don't need
to sell chocolate today.

01:03:54.835 --> 01:03:55.869
And why is that?

01:03:56.004 --> 01:03:57.124
You know that shop?

01:03:57.205 --> 01:03:59.008
The one you've
been dreaming of?

01:04:14.323 --> 01:04:16.625
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

01:04:16.761 --> 01:04:19.160
It may need a little work.

01:04:21.364 --> 01:04:22.836
Looks like someone
left the water running

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.695
twenty years ago
and the ceiling fell through.

01:04:24.831 --> 01:04:27.365
And the ceiling above that,
and the ceiling above that.

01:04:27.501 --> 01:04:29.703
But that means
we can afford it.

01:04:29.839 --> 01:04:31.204
For a week, anyway.

01:04:31.339 --> 01:04:33.040
And we'd finally
be legitimate.

01:04:33.176 --> 01:04:34.709
The police wouldn't
have any excuse

01:04:34.844 --> 01:04:36.979
to keep bothering us.

01:04:37.115 --> 01:04:39.613
So,
what do you think, Willy?

01:04:39.748 --> 01:04:40.951
Do you like it?

01:04:43.082 --> 01:04:44.515
Do I like it?

01:04:47.422 --> 01:04:49.290
Noodle, it's just
as I always imagined.

01:04:49.425 --> 01:04:52.728
No, scratch that,
it's better than I imagined.

01:04:52.863 --> 01:04:54.295
I mean, look at this place.

01:04:54.431 --> 01:04:56.351
I mean, yeah, it's a wreck,
but... the potential!

01:04:56.461 --> 01:04:58.368
The bones!

01:04:58.504 --> 01:05:00.343
You mark my words,
this is gonna be the best chocolate shop

01:05:00.367 --> 01:05:02.204
- the world has ever seen.
- Whoo!

01:05:02.339 --> 01:05:04.118
You won't be scrub-scrubbin'
much longer, Noodle.

01:05:04.142 --> 01:05:05.742
We'll all be free.

01:05:05.809 --> 01:05:07.444
As free as flamingos!

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.118
There's six of them
in total.

01:05:21.254 --> 01:05:22.586
Including the little girl.

01:05:22.722 --> 01:05:24.888
She seems to be the brains
of the operation.

01:05:25.024 --> 01:05:28.093
They're based out of a laundry
called Scrubitt and Bleacher.

01:05:28.229 --> 01:05:30.228
Scrubitt's?

01:05:30.363 --> 01:05:32.429
That's right. Why, you know it?

01:05:32.565 --> 01:05:34.936
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I do.

01:05:35.072 --> 01:05:36.436
They just
rented a shop.

01:05:36.571 --> 01:05:38.501
So, legally, I can't
touch them. But illegally,

01:05:38.637 --> 01:05:41.175
I'm happy to do
whatever you guys want.

01:05:41.311 --> 01:05:42.887
You want 'em all
to have a little accident?

01:05:42.911 --> 01:05:44.040
In which they die?

01:05:44.176 --> 01:05:45.510
Not a problem.

01:05:45.645 --> 01:05:47.321
But it's gonna cost you
a lot more chocolate.

01:05:47.345 --> 01:05:48.845
It's all right, Chief.

01:05:48.981 --> 01:05:50.990
And also, I'd, uh,
be grateful for an advance.

01:05:51.014 --> 01:05:53.423
'Cause the last boxes
you gave me...

01:05:53.559 --> 01:05:54.787
they're gone.

01:05:54.922 --> 01:05:56.057
All of them?

01:05:56.193 --> 01:05:57.600
I've been eating
these little paper cases

01:05:57.624 --> 01:05:59.424
for the... for the past
three days.

01:05:59.497 --> 01:06:01.203
You know, you think they're
gonna give you the same hit.

01:06:01.227 --> 01:06:03.258
They don't.

01:06:03.394 --> 01:06:04.527
Oh.

01:06:04.663 --> 01:06:06.168
There you go, Chief.

01:06:06.303 --> 01:06:07.966
There's plenty more
where that came from.

01:06:08.102 --> 01:06:10.205
You stand down for now.

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:11.749
We'll give you a call
when the time is right.

01:06:18.244 --> 01:06:19.275
What is it, Arthur?

01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:21.077
The girl.

01:06:21.212 --> 01:06:23.612
You don't really think
it could be her, do you?

01:06:24.082 --> 01:06:25.485
I do.

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:28.351
You always assured us
she wouldn't be a problem.

01:06:28.487 --> 01:06:30.560
He's right. You did assure us.

01:06:30.695 --> 01:06:32.122
And she won't be.

01:06:32.257 --> 01:06:33.522
Nor will Wonka.

01:06:33.657 --> 01:06:36.291
I'll see to it, personally.

01:06:39.435 --> 01:06:41.115
Who is it?
What d'you want?

01:06:44.406 --> 01:06:46.334
Mr. Slugworth.

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:48.045
Just a minute, sir.

01:06:49.175 --> 01:06:50.709
Good evening.

01:06:50.845 --> 01:06:53.609
- Good evening.
- Who is it, puffy-wu...

01:06:53.745 --> 01:06:55.191
Stone me.

01:06:55.215 --> 01:06:56.582
It's Mr. Slugworth.

01:06:56.717 --> 01:06:58.955
To what do we owe the honor?

01:06:59.090 --> 01:07:01.553
You have a guest.
A Mr. Wonka?

01:07:01.688 --> 01:07:03.389
He's been sneaking out
to sell chocolate

01:07:03.524 --> 01:07:04.991
with the help
of your serving girl.

01:07:05.126 --> 01:07:06.827
Why, that little brat.

01:07:06.963 --> 01:07:08.429
Well, quite.

01:07:08.565 --> 01:07:11.530
I wondered if you might
help me put an end to their...

01:07:12.098 --> 01:07:13.867
business.

01:07:22.947 --> 01:07:24.477
Here we go, Mamma.

01:07:34.219 --> 01:07:37.154
Ladies and gentlemen,
greetings to you all,

01:07:37.290 --> 01:07:40.425
and welcome to Wonka's.

01:07:40.561 --> 01:07:42.427
Tremendous things
are in store,

01:07:42.562 --> 01:07:45.798
both literally
and metaphorically.

01:07:45.933 --> 01:07:47.196
What?

01:07:47.331 --> 01:07:48.600
In there?

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:50.740

So, mushrooms,
pears, assorted flowers.

01:11:27.323 --> 01:11:30.290
That comes to 89 sovereigns.

01:11:30.426 --> 01:11:32.487
A bargain at twice the price.

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:33.824
Thank you, sir.

01:11:33.959 --> 01:11:36.030
And how would
you like your change?

01:11:36.166 --> 01:11:38.098
Spendable or edible?

01:11:38.234 --> 01:11:39.897
Oh, edible, please.

01:11:41.602 --> 01:11:43.098
Enjoy.

01:11:43.233 --> 01:11:45.740
And, uh, don't forget
to eat your basket.

01:11:45.876 --> 01:11:47.542
Oh.

01:11:47.677 --> 01:11:50.212
Abacus, that man just
gave us 100 sovereigns.

01:11:50.348 --> 01:11:52.508
I know, Noodle!

01:11:52.643 --> 01:11:53.810
Who's next?

01:11:53.946 --> 01:11:54.817
- That'll be me.
- Me!

01:11:59.450 --> 01:12:00.450
Uh...

01:12:00.518 --> 01:12:01.657
Mr. Wonka?

01:12:01.793 --> 01:12:02.887
Yes?

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.355
What's going on here?

01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:06.929
Oh, my goodness.

01:12:07.064 --> 01:12:08.160
That's impossible.

01:12:08.295 --> 01:12:09.630
Unless...

01:12:12.970 --> 01:12:14.265
Yeti sweat?

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.869
Yeti sweat?

01:12:16.004 --> 01:12:17.647
The most powerful
hair potion in the world.

01:12:17.671 --> 01:12:19.772
But I didn't put it in there.

01:12:19.907 --> 01:12:22.478
Ladies and gentlemen!
Your attention, please!

01:12:22.613 --> 01:12:24.408
There appears
to be a manufacturing error.

01:12:24.544 --> 01:12:26.211
Nobody eat the flowers!

01:12:26.346 --> 01:12:28.379
Uh, why not?

01:12:28.515 --> 01:12:29.882
What's wrong with them?

01:12:30.017 --> 01:12:31.731
What's the matter
with this toadstool?

01:12:31.755 --> 01:12:33.918
My daughter took one bite,
and just look at her!

01:12:34.053 --> 01:12:36.188
There's nothing wrong
with the chocolate milk,

01:12:36.323 --> 01:12:37.323
is there?

01:12:37.427 --> 01:12:38.758
I'm terribly sorry, everyone,

01:12:38.894 --> 01:12:40.614
and I don't know
how to explain this, but...

01:12:40.699 --> 01:12:42.659
it appears that the chocolates
have been poisoned!

01:12:42.762 --> 01:12:43.893
Poisoned?

01:12:44.029 --> 01:12:45.796
- Poisoned?
- He poisoned my child!

01:12:45.932 --> 01:12:47.498
I didn't...
I didn't poison them.

01:12:47.633 --> 01:12:49.301
I want my money back.

01:12:49.437 --> 01:12:50.499
I want compensation.

01:12:50.634 --> 01:12:52.068
I want revenge.

01:12:53.339 --> 01:12:54.437
Whoa!

01:13:00.050 --> 01:13:01.050
No, no! Please!

01:13:06.151 --> 01:13:09.019
This is what you get for
mustach-ing my daughter!

01:13:12.362 --> 01:13:15.075
- I'll wait for you.
- Help! I have to get away from this place.

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:17.895
And that, I believe,

01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:21.097
is the end
of Wonka's Chocolate Shop.

01:13:40.723 --> 01:13:42.123
I don't understand.
What...

01:13:44.324 --> 01:13:45.324
What...

01:13:46.394 --> 01:13:47.426
What happened?

01:13:47.562 --> 01:13:49.230
Isn't it obvious?

01:13:49.365 --> 01:13:51.226
The Chocolate Cartel.

01:13:54.032 --> 01:13:56.665
It's okay, Willy.
We can rebuild.

01:13:56.801 --> 01:13:58.140
We can start again.

01:13:58.276 --> 01:13:59.839
There's no point, Noodle.

01:14:01.243 --> 01:14:03.078
It didn't work.

01:14:03.213 --> 01:14:04.677
What do you mean?

01:14:04.812 --> 01:14:06.714
She promised
she would be here.

01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:10.111
She wasn't.

01:14:10.247 --> 01:14:12.153
You didn't actually
think that...

01:14:12.288 --> 01:14:13.288
No, I did.

01:14:16.094 --> 01:14:17.319
Stupid dream.

01:14:17.454 --> 01:14:19.494
Don't say that, Willy.
Please don't ever...

01:14:19.561 --> 01:14:21.397
Come on, Noodle.

01:14:21.533 --> 01:14:24.259
I think Mr. Wonka
needs to be alone.

01:14:36.281 --> 01:14:40.715
Every good thing
in this world started with a dream.

01:14:44.014 --> 01:14:47.385
So you hold on to yours.

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.561
And when you do share chocolate
with the world, oh...

01:14:52.957 --> 01:14:55.829
I'll be right there beside ya.

01:14:58.066 --> 01:15:00.537
Terrible shame,
what happened here.

01:15:02.706 --> 01:15:04.066
Take it you're
responsible?

01:15:04.170 --> 01:15:06.937
Us? Oh, no.
Well, not personally.

01:15:07.073 --> 01:15:10.443
We may have
encouraged Mrs. Scrubitt

01:15:10.579 --> 01:15:12.514
to enhance your creations.

01:15:12.650 --> 01:15:14.313
We paid her
to poison them.

01:15:14.448 --> 01:15:17.186
- Yes, thank you, Gerald.
- You're welcome.

01:15:17.321 --> 01:15:19.081
So why have you come?

01:15:19.216 --> 01:15:21.184
- To gloat?
- Oh, no, Mr. Wonka,

01:15:21.319 --> 01:15:23.492
I don't waste my time
with that sort of thing.

01:15:23.627 --> 01:15:26.795
We've come
to offer you a deal.

01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:32.193
This is the precise amount
you owe Mrs. Scrubitt.

01:15:32.329 --> 01:15:34.967
This is for
the number cruncher,

01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:37.039
the plumber,

01:15:37.174 --> 01:15:39.306
the telephonist,

01:15:39.442 --> 01:15:42.579
the so-called funny-man,

01:15:43.114 --> 01:15:44.779
and this...

01:15:46.414 --> 01:15:47.714
is for the girl.

01:15:47.850 --> 01:15:49.749
Now, we put in
a bit extra for her.

01:15:49.885 --> 01:15:51.581
So that she can
get a place to live,

01:15:51.716 --> 01:15:53.018
clothes, toys...

01:15:54.289 --> 01:15:55.724
books.

01:15:56.923 --> 01:15:59.058
Oh, yes, Mr. Wonka.

01:15:59.193 --> 01:16:03.765
You could change her life.
Change all their lives.

01:16:05.436 --> 01:16:06.768
And what would I have to do?

01:16:07.468 --> 01:16:08.704
Leave town.

01:16:09.404 --> 01:16:10.805
Oh, and, um,

01:16:11.739 --> 01:16:15.038
never make chocolate again.

01:16:15.174 --> 01:16:17.439
There's a boat
sailing at midnight.

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:19.479
And for their sake,
as much as your own,

01:16:19.614 --> 01:16:21.948

01:17:21.807 --> 01:17:23.477
To the North Pole.

01:17:23.612 --> 01:17:25.208
It's premium economy.

01:17:25.343 --> 01:17:27.013
Yeah,
it's basically economy.

01:17:27.149 --> 01:17:28.827
I mean, yeah,
you get a little more legroom.

01:17:28.851 --> 01:17:30.352
A complimentary
packet of peanuts.

01:17:30.487 --> 01:17:31.820
Is it worth the extra?

01:17:31.956 --> 01:17:35.052

Oh, I'm not going to let you
out of my sight, Willy Wonka.

01:18:53.198 --> 01:18:54.769
Not till you've
paid your debt.

01:18:54.905 --> 01:18:58.174
But I bring glad tidings
on that score.

01:18:58.309 --> 01:18:59.033
What's that?

01:18:59.169 --> 01:19:00.971
I've been doing my sums.

01:19:01.107 --> 01:19:03.471
One more jar, and we're even.

01:19:03.607 --> 01:19:06.814
Or, if you prefer,
I will accept half a jar

01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:08.816
of those rather
amusing Hoverchocs.

01:19:08.952 --> 01:19:10.817
You're outta luck.

01:19:10.952 --> 01:19:13.051
I don't make chocolate
anymore.

01:19:13.186 --> 01:19:15.929
Oh, dear, please don't tell me you're going to
go through with this ridiculous deal?

01:19:15.953 --> 01:19:16.953
I have to.

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:18.989
For Noodle.

01:19:19.125 --> 01:19:21.061
I promised her a better life.

01:19:21.927 --> 01:19:23.161
I pinkie promised.

01:19:23.297 --> 01:19:24.763
You should stand up
to those bullies.

01:19:24.899 --> 01:19:26.230
Give 'em the old one-two.

01:19:26.366 --> 01:19:28.299
That's what
an Oompa Loompa would do.

01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:32.436
But if you are determined

01:19:32.571 --> 01:19:34.804
to just sit there
feeling sorry for yourself,

01:19:34.939 --> 01:19:36.575
I am going flat.

01:19:36.710 --> 01:19:38.313
Good night, sir.

01:19:47.017 --> 01:19:48.017
Huh.

01:19:51.221 --> 01:19:53.823
What is it?

01:19:53.958 --> 01:19:55.393
No, nothing.

01:19:55.529 --> 01:19:58.500
Well, it's obviously something
because you said, "Huh."

01:19:58.635 --> 01:20:00.265
I'm sorry. Forget it.

01:20:01.564 --> 01:20:04.269
Very well.

01:20:08.708 --> 01:20:09.978
Huh.

01:20:10.113 --> 01:20:11.486
Oh, you did it again.

01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:12.992
Tell me what it is,
or I shall poke you

01:20:13.016 --> 01:20:14.257
quite viciously
with a cocktail stick.

01:20:14.281 --> 01:20:16.012
Look. Where Slugworth
shook my hand.

01:20:16.148 --> 01:20:18.083
His ring left a mark. See?

01:20:18.219 --> 01:20:20.086
It's an "A,"
surrounded by "S"s.

01:20:20.222 --> 01:20:22.657
So what?
His name is Arthur Slugworth.

01:20:22.792 --> 01:20:24.254
It's probably a family ring.

01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:25.988
Yes, but Noodle has one
just like it.

01:20:26.123 --> 01:20:27.691
- Noodle?
- Uh-huh.

01:20:27.826 --> 01:20:31.426
Why would Noodle the orphan
have a Slugworth family ring?

01:20:31.562 --> 01:20:33.500
There's only one reason
I can think of.

01:20:33.635 --> 01:20:35.037
Which is?

01:20:35.172 --> 01:20:36.510
And if I'm correct, Noodle
could be in grave danger.

01:20:36.534 --> 01:20:38.708
Well, come on, Wonka.
Spit it out.

01:20:38.843 --> 01:20:40.402
Produce your owl pellet
of wisdom.

01:20:40.538 --> 01:20:42.071
There's no time.
I gotta get back.

01:20:42.206 --> 01:20:44.012
- Captain!
- Wonka?

01:20:44.147 --> 01:20:47.512
Come back here. Wonka!
I demand an explanation.

01:20:47.648 --> 01:20:48.648
Captain?

01:20:50.352 --> 01:20:54.048
On second thoughts,
the explanation can wait.

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:55.419
Good day to you.

01:21:04.569 --> 01:21:05.569
Well, gentlemen,

01:21:05.695 --> 01:21:08.663
one dead chocolatier,
as requested.

01:21:10.508 --> 01:21:11.533
Miss Bon-Bon?

01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:13.070
Yes, Mr. Slugworth?

01:21:13.206 --> 01:21:14.911
Give the chief his chocolate.

01:21:23.248 --> 01:21:24.919
My, my.

01:21:25.055 --> 01:21:27.552
What a lot o' long faces
this morning.

01:21:27.688 --> 01:21:30.553
It's almost as though you lot
had a sneaky little scheme

01:21:30.688 --> 01:21:32.657
to try and wriggle out
of your contracts.

01:21:32.792 --> 01:21:35.998
Which spectacularly misfired.

01:21:36.133 --> 01:21:37.928
But I've got some good news
for you lot,

01:21:38.064 --> 01:21:39.563
not that you deserve it.

01:21:39.698 --> 01:21:43.239
Your friend, Mr. Wonka,
done a deal with Mr. Slugworth.

01:21:43.374 --> 01:21:44.435
What?

01:21:44.570 --> 01:21:48.043
Gave up on his dream
to settle your accounts.

01:21:48.945 --> 01:21:50.474
- Mr. Crunch.
- Present.

01:21:54.277 --> 01:21:55.545
You're free to go.

01:21:56.949 --> 01:21:58.150
Scram, bookworm.

01:21:58.286 --> 01:21:59.726
- Bell.
- Hello.

01:21:59.824 --> 01:22:00.961
Sling yer hook.

01:22:00.985 --> 01:22:02.255
Benz.

01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:04.055
You ain't gotta tell me twice.

01:22:04.191 --> 01:22:05.391
Chucklesworth.

01:22:05.524 --> 01:22:07.022
You've been
a terrible audience.

01:22:07.157 --> 01:22:08.559
Good night!

01:22:08.694 --> 01:22:10.008
Yeah, well, you ain't been
much of a comedian, mate.

01:22:10.032 --> 01:22:12.197
- I know.
- Hey, Larry.

01:22:12.333 --> 01:22:14.964
Keep going.
You've got something.

01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:16.267
You scare me.

01:22:16.403 --> 01:22:19.266
And finally, Noodle.

01:22:19.402 --> 01:22:22.008
Biggest pile o' the lot.

01:22:22.144 --> 01:22:24.442
But this isn't
to pay your bill.

01:22:24.577 --> 01:22:26.915
This is to keep you here.

01:22:27.051 --> 01:22:28.371
What do you mean?

01:22:28.449 --> 01:22:30.580
My friend, Mr. Slugworth,

01:22:30.716 --> 01:22:32.820
doesn't think
nasty little urchins like you

01:22:32.956 --> 01:22:34.116
should be out on the streets,

01:22:34.152 --> 01:22:35.723
lowering the tone.

01:22:35.859 --> 01:22:37.653
So, he gave me this money

01:22:37.789 --> 01:22:41.325
to keep you down
in the Wash House for good.

01:22:41.461 --> 01:22:44.129
And I'm only
too happy to oblige.

01:22:44.264 --> 01:22:45.494
- I hate you!
- Hey!

01:22:45.630 --> 01:22:47.046
Hey, hey, hey.

01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:48.629
Look at her go,
Lord Bleachowitz.

01:22:48.765 --> 01:22:50.501
Lord Bleachowitz?

01:22:50.636 --> 01:22:52.572
You don't still think
he's a lord, do you?

01:22:52.707 --> 01:22:53.843
What?

01:22:53.978 --> 01:22:55.977
We made it up,
you stupid old hag.

01:22:56.113 --> 01:22:57.541
She's...
she's lying.

01:22:57.677 --> 01:23:00.113
Right, that's it,
you horrible little brat.

01:23:00.249 --> 01:23:02.884
You're goin' in the coop,
my girl.

01:23:03.019 --> 01:23:05.786
And you!
Take them dungarees off,

01:23:05.922 --> 01:23:08.787
you... you peasant.

01:23:08.922 --> 01:23:10.723
But Puffy-wuffy.

01:23:10.858 --> 01:23:12.292
I wuv you.

01:23:39.151 --> 01:23:40.483
Hello, Noodle.

01:23:40.619 --> 01:23:43.686
Willy.
I thought you'd gone.

01:23:44.187 --> 01:23:45.390
I did.

01:23:45.525 --> 01:23:46.988
Slugworth promised you
a better life,

01:23:47.123 --> 01:23:49.457
but he didn't exactly
keep his side of the bargain.

01:23:49.592 --> 01:23:51.329
So I came back. We all did.

01:23:51.465 --> 01:23:52.839
- Hey, Noodle.
- How do?

01:23:52.863 --> 01:23:54.423
Hey.
Surprise!

01:23:54.535 --> 01:23:56.133
He wants me
locked up forever.

01:23:56.269 --> 01:23:57.839
Yeah, well, that figures.

01:23:57.975 --> 01:24:00.108
Why? What's he got against me?

01:24:00.243 --> 01:24:01.939
I don't know, Noodle.
Not for sure.

01:24:02.074 --> 01:24:04.454
All I know for certain
is that you won't be safe until Slugworth

01:24:04.478 --> 01:24:07.347
is behind bars.

01:24:07.482 --> 01:24:10.281
And how exactly
is that supposed to happen?

01:24:10.416 --> 01:24:12.218
Abacus.
You said the Cartel keep

01:24:12.354 --> 01:24:13.722
a record
of all their dirty deeds.

01:24:13.858 --> 01:24:15.222
In the green ledger, yes.

01:24:15.358 --> 01:24:16.831
So if we can
get hold o' that,

01:24:16.855 --> 01:24:18.436
we can prove that
they poisoned our chocolate.

01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:19.773
Scrubitt and Bleacher
would go to jail,

01:24:19.797 --> 01:24:20.829
and we'll all be free.

01:24:20.965 --> 01:24:22.756
Uh, yes, but may I remind you,

01:24:22.892 --> 01:24:24.899
they keep that ledger
in a vault.

01:24:25.034 --> 01:24:26.361
Guarded by a corrupt cleric.

01:24:26.497 --> 01:24:28.663
And 500 chocoholic monks.

01:24:28.799 --> 01:24:31.238
- Mm-hmm.
- That's all true.

01:24:31.374 --> 01:24:33.668
But I went for a long,
cold swim this morning.

01:24:33.803 --> 01:24:35.307
Cold water is very good
for the brain.

01:24:35.442 --> 01:24:37.212
Stimulates
the neural pathways.

01:24:37.347 --> 01:24:39.241
And after just four miles,
it came to me.

01:24:39.377 --> 01:24:41.046
How an ingenious orphan,

01:24:41.182 --> 01:24:42.213
an accountant, a plumber,

01:24:42.349 --> 01:24:44.251
a telephone exchange operator,

01:24:44.386 --> 01:24:45.986
and a man
who can speak underwater,

01:24:46.121 --> 01:24:47.353
could combine those talents,

01:24:47.489 --> 01:24:48.983
and pull off
the heist of the century.

01:24:49.118 --> 01:24:51.888
But even if we do get
our hands on that ledger,

01:24:52.024 --> 01:24:54.963
the Cartel will simply bribe
their way out of trouble.

01:24:55.099 --> 01:24:57.166
It's what they do.

01:24:57.301 --> 01:24:58.838
The greedy
beat the needy, Willy.

01:24:58.862 --> 01:25:00.902
It's just the way
of the world.

01:25:01.038 --> 01:25:02.436
You're right, Noodle.

01:25:02.571 --> 01:25:04.383
I guess that's why
there's one other thing to do.

01:25:04.407 --> 01:25:06.901
- What's that?
- Change the world.

01:25:10.209 --> 01:25:11.209
Whoa!

01:25:12.816 --> 01:25:13.816
Where do we start?

01:25:26.329 --> 01:25:27.992
'Scuse me, sir.

01:25:28.127 --> 01:25:30.694
Could you spare a piece of chocolate
for a starvin' orphan?

01:25:30.829 --> 01:25:34.603
I'm sorry, my child.
I don't have any on me.

01:25:34.738 --> 01:25:36.238
Oh.

01:25:37.770 --> 01:25:39.637
Then have some acacia mints.

01:25:40.743 --> 01:25:41.743
Yes!

01:25:44.282 --> 01:25:47.047
"To Basil Bond,
employee of the week."

01:25:47.183 --> 01:25:48.383
Oh, that's lovely...

01:26:00.297 --> 01:26:02.197
Everything all right
back there?

01:26:02.332 --> 01:26:04.829
Everything's fine.
Isn't it, Abigail?

01:26:06.732 --> 01:26:08.368
Tell her she might
want to duck.

01:26:08.504 --> 01:26:10.166
Tell her she might
wanna what?

01:26:10.302 --> 01:26:11.471
Duck!

01:26:15.312 --> 01:26:16.619
Good morning, brethren.

01:26:16.643 --> 01:26:17.917
Good morning, Father.

01:26:17.941 --> 01:26:19.646
Now, as you all know,

01:26:19.782 --> 01:26:22.179
it's Baron von Schmeichelhammer's
funeral today.

01:26:22.315 --> 01:26:25.582
And his widow is...

01:26:25.718 --> 01:26:28.456
- a bit of a pious type.
- Ugh!

01:26:28.591 --> 01:26:29.929
So, I don't want to see anyone

01:26:29.953 --> 01:26:32.091
eating chocolate
during the service.

01:26:32.227 --> 01:26:33.928
Yes, Father.

01:26:34.064 --> 01:26:35.262
We all know that one day,

01:26:35.398 --> 01:26:37.264
we shall be judged
for our sins,

01:26:37.399 --> 01:26:40.461
but it's not going
to be today.

01:26:40.597 --> 01:26:42.568
Amen.

01:26:56.318 --> 01:26:57.950
There, there.

01:26:58.086 --> 01:26:59.951

You know what you've done,
Julius.

01:27:20.578 --> 01:27:22.740
You've sold your soul
for 30 pieces of chocolate.

01:27:26.682 --> 01:27:28.880
Hello, operator.
How may I direct your call?

01:27:29.016 --> 01:27:31.753
I need the Zoo.
It's an emergency.

01:27:31.888 --> 01:27:34.822
Putting you through
to the Escaped Animal Department now.

01:27:36.926 --> 01:27:38.125
Hello, Zoo.

01:27:41.328 --> 01:27:43.427
Quiet down, you animals.

01:27:43.562 --> 01:27:45.195
You too, octopus.

01:27:45.330 --> 01:27:47.612
- There's a giraffe.
- What? Oh, yeah, I think

01:27:47.636 --> 01:27:49.075
we did lose a giraffe.

01:27:49.099 --> 01:27:50.536
Well, could you come
and get it?

01:27:50.672 --> 01:27:53.067
Okay, jeez.
I'll send the guys around.

01:28:05.185 --> 01:28:06.916
Oh, forgive me!

01:28:08.024 --> 01:28:09.222
I'm a sinner!

01:28:09.358 --> 01:28:13.659
A weak and wicked chocoholic!

01:28:22.699 --> 01:28:24.231
Good morning, everyone.

01:28:24.367 --> 01:28:27.001
Welcome to St. Benedict's.

01:28:27.137 --> 01:28:30.842
Baroness,
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:28:30.977 --> 01:28:35.444
We're just having a few
technical difficulties, um,

01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:36.746
so you might want to pop

01:28:36.882 --> 01:28:38.787
the late baron down
for a minute.

01:28:40.451 --> 01:28:41.820
Ah, the cavalry.

01:28:41.955 --> 01:28:44.591
Are you the cleric
who called about a giraffe?

01:28:50.628 --> 01:28:52.027
All clear.

01:29:17.956 --> 01:29:20.154
Huh. "Thanks
for all your hard work."

01:29:20.289 --> 01:29:23.491
"Father Julius
and the Chocolate Cartel."

01:29:23.626 --> 01:29:25.401
Oh, that's nice.

01:29:26.133 --> 01:29:27.603
Mmm.

01:29:27.738 --> 01:29:28.976
Here we are, Father.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.804
One giraffe.

01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:32.782
- Marvelous.
- Thank you, thank you.

01:29:32.806 --> 01:29:34.302
Stand back, please.
Stand back.

01:29:34.438 --> 01:29:38.077

01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:43.013

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:46.349
She can really move.

01:29:46.484 --> 01:29:48.094
I could've been happy,
but I threw a pearl away.

01:29:48.118 --> 01:29:50.050
I'll give him a call.
No, I can't.

01:29:50.186 --> 01:29:51.922
I will give him a call
actually.

01:29:58.132 --> 01:29:59.132
Hello?

01:29:59.202 --> 01:30:01.265
Basil? It's Gwennie.

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:02.400
You were right.

01:30:02.504 --> 01:30:04.102
What are the chances?

01:30:04.238 --> 01:30:07.505
Those days in chemistry class
were the happiest of my life.

01:30:27.425 --> 01:30:29.096
Cool.

01:30:36.372 --> 01:30:37.571
Sorry about this, sir.

01:30:37.706 --> 01:30:39.102
The seafood truck
spilled its load.

01:30:39.237 --> 01:30:41.237
There's so many blasted
flamingos about these days.

01:30:41.338 --> 01:30:43.339
Well,
hurry it along now, will you?

01:30:43.474 --> 01:30:45.713
The town square
was closed this morning

01:30:45.849 --> 01:30:48.684
after a bizarre incident
at the city cathedral.

01:30:48.819 --> 01:30:51.781
Delaying the funeral
of noted philanthropist,

01:30:51.916 --> 01:30:53.949
Baron von Schmeichelhammer.

01:30:54.085 --> 01:30:55.818
In nomine Patris,

01:30:55.953 --> 01:30:59.561
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

01:31:00.062 --> 01:31:01.458
Amen.

01:31:05.899 --> 01:31:08.233
Sorry, I'd best get that.

01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:11.437
- Hello, pulpit?
- Father.

01:31:11.572 --> 01:31:12.837
Everything all right there?

01:31:12.972 --> 01:31:14.416
Oh, yes, Mr. Slugworth.

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:16.308
All tickety-boo.

01:31:16.444 --> 01:31:17.844
At least, it is now.

01:31:17.979 --> 01:31:19.451
What do you mean by that?

01:31:19.475 --> 01:31:21.211
Oh, we had a giraffe
in here earlier.

01:31:21.347 --> 01:31:23.023
Had to clear the whole place
for about 20 minutes,

01:31:23.047 --> 01:31:24.916
but everything's
back to normal.

01:31:27.254 --> 01:31:28.490
Hello?

01:31:28.626 --> 01:31:30.552
Damn the flamingos,
Donovan! Floor it!

01:31:30.687 --> 01:31:32.192
Yes, sir!

01:31:35.230 --> 01:31:36.658
Idiot!

01:31:40.403 --> 01:31:42.136
- Anything?
- Nothing.

01:31:42.272 --> 01:31:43.272
Well, keep looking.

01:31:43.407 --> 01:31:44.687
It's not in here, Willy.

01:31:44.774 --> 01:31:46.469
But Abacus said
that it was here.

01:31:46.605 --> 01:31:48.721
Abacus has been in the Wash House
for the past four years.

01:31:48.745 --> 01:31:50.639
Maybe all the scrubbing
has gone to his head.

01:31:50.775 --> 01:31:53.747
'Cause all that's down here
is just a bunch of stupid old chocolate.

01:32:09.231 --> 01:32:10.566
Willy, look!

01:32:18.538 --> 01:32:20.035
We did it, Noodle.

01:32:20.170 --> 01:32:22.010
We got 'em.

01:32:23.747 --> 01:32:26.042
Naughty, naughty,
Mr. Wonka.

01:32:26.177 --> 01:32:29.183
You've caused us
quite a bit of trouble.

01:32:29.319 --> 01:32:30.947
You and your urchin.

01:32:31.083 --> 01:32:32.682
Yeah, but she's not
just an urchin,

01:32:32.817 --> 01:32:33.987
is she, Mr. Slugworth?

01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:37.153
You're family.

01:32:37.788 --> 01:32:38.922
What?

01:32:39.057 --> 01:32:40.893
What are you talking about,
Willy?

01:32:42.531 --> 01:32:44.398
You know that ring, Noodle?

01:32:44.534 --> 01:32:46.194
The one your parents gave you?

01:32:46.329 --> 01:32:48.566
Mr. Slugworth has one
just like it.

01:32:48.702 --> 01:32:50.865
Don't you, Mr. Slugworth?

01:32:51.001 --> 01:32:53.607
As a matter of fact, I do.

01:32:53.743 --> 01:32:58.476
That belonged to my brother.
Zebedee.

01:32:58.611 --> 01:32:59.877
Was he my father?

01:33:00.013 --> 01:33:02.717
A hopeless romantic
is what he was.

01:33:02.853 --> 01:33:05.080
Fell in love with
a common little bookworm,

01:33:05.215 --> 01:33:07.183
died before
they could marry.

01:33:07.318 --> 01:33:11.187
Leaving me sole heir
to the family fortune.

01:33:12.195 --> 01:33:14.493
Or so I thought.

01:33:14.628 --> 01:33:16.291
But nine months later,

01:33:16.426 --> 01:33:18.561
your mother turned up
on my doorstep,

01:33:18.696 --> 01:33:22.165
begging me to get a doctor
for her sick little newborn.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.035
I said I would help.

01:33:25.170 --> 01:33:26.901
But you didn't.
Did you?

01:33:27.037 --> 01:33:28.603
Oh, no.

01:33:28.738 --> 01:33:30.806
Instead, you put me
down a laundry chute.

01:33:30.942 --> 01:33:32.744
Bye-bye, baby.

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.810
Mrs. Scrubitt found me.

01:33:34.945 --> 01:33:36.345
She saw the ring.

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:39.017
Thought it was an "N,"
and called me Noodle.

01:33:39.751 --> 01:33:40.784
But it wasn't.

01:33:40.919 --> 01:33:42.950
It was "Z." For Zebedee.

01:33:43.086 --> 01:33:45.119
Well, quite.

01:33:45.254 --> 01:33:47.467
- When your mother returned, I told her you had died.
- Oh, no!

01:33:47.491 --> 01:33:49.171
She was
heartbroken, of course.

01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:50.909
But, uh, I gave her
a handful of sovereigns

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.229
and had her escorted
from my property.

01:33:55.305 --> 01:33:56.837
What was her name?

01:33:57.338 --> 01:33:58.537
Eh?

01:33:58.673 --> 01:34:00.907
My mom. What was her name?

01:34:02.079 --> 01:34:03.409
Ooh.

01:34:03.544 --> 01:34:04.911
Let me see. Um...

01:34:06.212 --> 01:34:08.883
No, I don't think
I could remember that.

01:34:09.018 --> 01:34:11.912
Sorry.
But you have to understand,

01:34:12.047 --> 01:34:13.753
she was very poor.

01:34:13.889 --> 01:34:15.951
Sorry, Felix.

01:34:16.087 --> 01:34:18.088
Her name was Dorothy.

01:34:18.223 --> 01:34:20.256
Dorothy Smith.
It says so right here.

01:34:21.024 --> 01:34:22.156
Dorothy?

01:34:22.291 --> 01:34:23.896
Well, what do you know?

01:34:24.032 --> 01:34:26.299
I guess you did teach me
to read after all.

01:34:27.905 --> 01:34:29.107
Well,
this is all very touching,

01:34:29.131 --> 01:34:30.735
but back to business.

01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:32.768
We'll take that, thank you.

01:34:32.904 --> 01:34:35.673
How much chocolate do you have at your factory,
Mr. Fickelgruber?

01:34:35.809 --> 01:34:37.808
Oh, about 80,000 gallons.

01:34:37.943 --> 01:34:39.841
Prodnose?

01:34:39.977 --> 01:34:40.977
Seventy-five?

01:34:41.079 --> 01:34:42.718
And I've got 150.

01:34:43.552 --> 01:34:45.087
That should be enough.

01:34:45.222 --> 01:34:46.222
For what?

01:34:46.951 --> 01:34:49.890
Death by chocolate.

01:35:07.904 --> 01:35:09.305
On you go.

01:35:27.892 --> 01:35:29.094
Uh, gentlemen.

01:35:30.292 --> 01:35:31.899
Considering the situation,

01:35:32.035 --> 01:35:34.332
I wondered if you'd do
a good deed on my behalf.

01:35:34.468 --> 01:35:35.468
A what?

01:35:35.603 --> 01:35:36.971
"A good deed."

01:35:37.106 --> 01:35:38.946
It's a sort of pointless act
of selflessness...

01:35:39.037 --> 01:35:41.476
Yes, of course, Mr. Wonka.

01:35:41.612 --> 01:35:43.373
What would you like us to do?

01:35:43.509 --> 01:35:45.847
I was wondering if you could
give this to someone.

01:35:46.881 --> 01:35:48.513
Only if you happen to see him.

01:35:48.649 --> 01:35:49.683
And who is it?

01:35:49.818 --> 01:35:51.979
- A little orange man.
- Eh?

01:35:52.115 --> 01:35:53.618
A little orange man.

01:35:53.754 --> 01:35:54.920
About eight inches high,

01:35:55.056 --> 01:35:56.617
with orange skin
and bright green hair.

01:35:56.753 --> 01:36:00.059
I owe him a jar of chocolates,
you see. And, well,

01:36:00.195 --> 01:36:02.792
I think these might be
the best I ever made.

01:36:02.928 --> 01:36:04.094
Well, in that case,

01:36:04.230 --> 01:36:06.362
I'll make sure
he gets them personally.

01:36:11.134 --> 01:36:12.841
Farewell, Mr. Wonka.

01:36:14.211 --> 01:36:15.211
Urchin.

01:36:27.221 --> 01:36:29.319
Willy...

01:36:54.849 --> 01:36:56.577
What are we gonna do, Willy?

01:36:56.712 --> 01:36:59.580
I don't know, Noodle.
I'll think of something.

01:37:06.555 --> 01:37:08.629
Best chocolate
he ever made, eh?

01:37:10.930 --> 01:37:12.697
- Whoo-hoo.
- Oh!

01:37:14.097 --> 01:37:15.498
I got it!

01:37:15.633 --> 01:37:16.945
What is it?
Did you think of something?

01:37:16.969 --> 01:37:18.269
Yes, I did.

01:37:18.404 --> 01:37:20.044
If we're gonna drown
in chocolate, Noodle,

01:37:20.177 --> 01:37:22.205
and let's face it, we're gonna
drown in chocolate,

01:37:22.341 --> 01:37:23.770
then it's gonna
be Wonka chocolate.

01:37:23.905 --> 01:37:26.946
We're not gonna drown, Willy.
Look, there's a light.

01:37:27.082 --> 01:37:28.878
We'll let the chocolate
lift us up,

01:37:29.014 --> 01:37:30.211
we'll bang on the glass,

01:37:30.346 --> 01:37:32.784
and pray somebody hears us.

01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:34.417
That's a much better idea.

01:37:37.021 --> 01:37:38.355
Ah, gentlemen.

01:37:38.491 --> 01:37:40.221
It was a bit of a close shave
this morning,

01:37:40.357 --> 01:37:41.961
and I was wondering if perhaps

01:37:42.097 --> 01:37:44.933
we could rethink
our arrangement. Or...

01:37:47.267 --> 01:37:50.966
Or... just leave things
as they are.

01:37:51.102 --> 01:37:52.303
Father.

01:37:53.571 --> 01:37:55.436
Well, Wonka might be as nutty
as a fruitcake,

01:37:55.572 --> 01:37:57.209
but he sure knew
how to make chocolate.

01:37:57.344 --> 01:37:58.850
- Mmm.
- But do you think

01:37:58.874 --> 01:38:00.914
we should have saved some
for the Little Orange Man?

01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:02.312
Tell me you're joking.

01:38:02.447 --> 01:38:05.613
Uh, yes. Yes, I am.
Sorry, why am I?

01:38:05.748 --> 01:38:07.262
Because
there's no such thing

01:38:07.286 --> 01:38:09.650
as a little orange man,
ya nincompoop.

01:38:12.863 --> 01:38:14.629
- Help!
- Help!

01:38:14.765 --> 01:38:16.025
Somebody help, please!

01:38:16.161 --> 01:38:18.063
- Please help!
- Help!

01:38:18.199 --> 01:38:20.600
Look. Look,
somebody's coming. Look.

01:38:20.736 --> 01:38:22.399
Willy, we're saved!

01:38:35.479 --> 01:38:38.052
- I'm sorry, Noodle.
- Don't be.

01:38:38.853 --> 01:38:40.950
You found my family.

01:38:41.086 --> 01:38:43.222
A mom who loved me.

01:38:43.991 --> 01:38:46.027
That's all I ever wanted.

01:38:47.827 --> 01:38:49.195
Deep breath now.

01:39:03.308 --> 01:39:06.981
Mmm! Exquisite.

01:39:07.117 --> 01:39:09.409
You mustn't let yourself
get so worked up.

01:39:09.545 --> 01:39:11.712
It's just a bit of chocolate.

01:39:11.847 --> 01:39:13.459
Correction.

01:39:13.483 --> 01:39:16.992
It was actually my chocolate.

01:39:23.827 --> 01:39:27.263
You have made
a very grave error, gentlemen.

01:39:27.398 --> 01:39:29.129
You steal from
an Oompa Loompa,

01:39:29.264 --> 01:39:30.438
we take back

01:39:30.573 --> 01:39:31.765
a thousandfold.

01:39:39.782 --> 01:39:41.214
What's going on, Willy?

01:39:42.015 --> 01:39:43.881
It's draining, Noodle.

01:39:44.016 --> 01:39:45.884
We've been saved!

01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:48.287
- By who?
- I don't know.

01:39:49.456 --> 01:39:51.559
By the Little Orange Man!

01:39:51.695 --> 01:39:52.452
- Look.
- Wh...

01:39:52.588 --> 01:39:54.657
The Little Orange Man!

01:39:54.792 --> 01:39:57.295
Thank you,
Little Orange Man! Thank you!

01:40:20.553 --> 01:40:22.987
Gentlemen.
Thank goodness you're okay.

01:40:23.123 --> 01:40:24.620
I came as fast as I could.

01:40:33.263 --> 01:40:35.033
Whew! Car shrunk.

01:40:35.168 --> 01:40:36.434
I'm sure it did.

01:40:36.569 --> 01:40:38.112
And you've nothing
to worry about, Chief.

01:40:38.136 --> 01:40:39.437
All under control.

01:40:39.572 --> 01:40:40.878
A couple of thieves broke in,
but I'm afraid

01:40:40.902 --> 01:40:43.875
they met with a little...
accident.

01:40:44.011 --> 01:40:46.779
In which they died.

01:40:48.450 --> 01:40:49.855
That's actually
rather good, Gerald.

01:40:49.879 --> 01:40:51.479
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

01:40:51.585 --> 01:40:53.520
Officer, would you kindly
take a look at this?

01:40:53.655 --> 01:40:54.849
Wonka!

01:40:54.984 --> 01:40:56.198
It details
every single illegal payment

01:40:56.222 --> 01:40:57.856
these men have ever made.

01:40:57.991 --> 01:40:59.425
Thousands of them.

01:40:59.561 --> 01:41:01.789
Affable, don't listen
to her. She's lyin'.

01:41:01.924 --> 01:41:03.764
Well, of course she is.

01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:05.127
She's not, sir.

01:41:05.263 --> 01:41:06.761
She's absolutely right.

01:41:07.362 --> 01:41:08.565
It's incredible.

01:41:09.232 --> 01:41:10.464
Oh. Well.

01:41:10.599 --> 01:41:12.435
Then that sounds like a case

01:41:12.570 --> 01:41:14.467
for the Chief of Police.

01:41:14.603 --> 01:41:17.089
So you give it to me, Affable,
I'll, uh... I'll take it off your hands.

01:41:17.113 --> 01:41:18.386
You know,
save you the paperwork.

01:41:18.410 --> 01:41:20.044
I can't do that,
I'm afraid, sir.

01:41:20.179 --> 01:41:21.446
Why's that?

01:41:21.581 --> 01:41:23.516
Because your name
is written down here.

01:41:23.652 --> 01:41:24.378
Huh?

01:41:24.514 --> 01:41:26.353
- A lot.
- Gentlemen...

01:41:26.488 --> 01:41:28.201
- You're under arrest.
- Run.

01:41:28.225 --> 01:41:29.431
We puttin'
handcuffs on, here?

01:41:29.455 --> 01:41:30.251
That's okay, Noodle.

01:41:30.387 --> 01:41:31.923
Give it one second.

01:41:34.227 --> 01:41:35.927
What's happening?

01:41:36.063 --> 01:41:37.363
Why are we airborne?

01:41:37.498 --> 01:41:38.703
You didn't eat
any of those chocolates,

01:41:38.727 --> 01:41:40.661
- did you, Mr. Slugworth?
- Why?

01:41:40.797 --> 01:41:42.157
Because
they're Hoverchocs.

01:41:42.270 --> 01:41:44.835
Delayed action,
but extra strong.

01:41:44.970 --> 01:41:47.016
You think you're
very clever, don't you, Wonka?

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:50.075
Well, there's a billion sovereigns of
chocolate beneath our feet.

01:41:50.210 --> 01:41:51.542
We'll get the best lawyers,

01:41:51.678 --> 01:41:53.878
bribe the judge,
rig the jury if we have to.

01:41:54.014 --> 01:41:56.147
We'll be fine.

01:41:56.282 --> 01:41:58.153
I wish I'd thought of that.

01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:02.520
Hey, Noodle!

01:42:21.042 --> 01:42:22.275
What is that?

01:42:22.411 --> 01:42:23.651
It's our chocolate!

01:42:23.675 --> 01:42:25.207
All our chocolate!

01:42:25.343 --> 01:42:26.543
We're ruined!

01:42:26.678 --> 01:42:27.993
Hey, don't worry, gentlemen.

01:42:28.017 --> 01:42:30.212
You'll come down eventually.

01:42:30.347 --> 01:42:33.214
Probably. I think.

01:42:33.349 --> 01:42:34.849
But until then,

01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:38.424
ladies and gentlemen,

01:42:38.559 --> 01:42:42.096
Willy Wonka and friends...

01:42:42.232 --> 01:42:45.563
...invite you
to enjoy our chocolate.

01:42:45.699 --> 01:42:47.961
Yay! Magic Wonka!

01:42:51.267 --> 01:42:52.405
Gwennie?

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:54.671
Basil!

01:42:55.738 --> 01:42:57.045
What did I say, Abacus,

01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:58.642
I told you
we could fix it all.

01:43:16.491 --> 01:43:17.760
Your cup.

01:43:18.427 --> 01:43:19.661
Thank you.

01:43:19.797 --> 01:43:21.280
- There you are.
- There you go.

01:43:21.304 --> 01:43:21.866
Careful, not too much.

01:43:22.001 --> 01:43:23.001
Okay.

01:45:01.196 --> 01:45:04.266
- Mmm.
- Oh, thank you.

01:45:04.401 --> 01:45:05.866
Thank you.

01:45:06.002 --> 01:45:08.274
- Mmm.
- Thank you.

01:45:08.409 --> 01:45:10.070
- Mmm.
- Oh.

01:45:19.184 --> 01:45:20.421
Huh.

01:45:24.053 --> 01:45:27.461
So...
how does it feel, Willy?

01:45:28.363 --> 01:45:29.958
Is it as good as you remember?

01:45:31.396 --> 01:45:32.932
Every little bit.

01:45:36.536 --> 01:45:38.098
I wish it could last forever.

01:45:44.475 --> 01:45:45.842
I guess it's time.

01:45:47.951 --> 01:45:49.477
Time for what?

01:45:49.612 --> 01:45:52.453
Do you know how many people
in this city are named D. Smith?

01:45:52.921 --> 01:45:55.022
106.

01:45:55.157 --> 01:45:57.601
And luckily, you have a friend who works
at the telephone exchange.

01:45:57.625 --> 01:45:59.519
And she spent
the entire afternoon

01:45:59.654 --> 01:46:01.125
ringing around.

01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:02.694
And guess what?

01:46:04.198 --> 01:46:05.433
We found her.

01:46:06.365 --> 01:46:07.796
You found my mom?

01:46:07.931 --> 01:46:09.767
She works
in the library.

01:46:11.239 --> 01:46:12.671
That's where she lives.

01:46:14.605 --> 01:46:15.839

01:47:58.477 --> 01:47:59.976
in a weary world.

01:48:00.111 --> 01:48:01.877
I was wondering
if I'd see you again.

01:48:02.013 --> 01:48:03.911
I'm not going anywhere,
Willy Wonka.

01:48:04.047 --> 01:48:05.614
Not until you've
paid your debt.

01:48:05.749 --> 01:48:07.388
Now, I know you tried.

01:48:07.524 --> 01:48:09.957
Loompa law is very clear
on this subject.

01:48:10.092 --> 01:48:11.218
Until such time

01:48:11.354 --> 01:48:13.924
as the chocolate is physically
in my hand...

01:48:15.593 --> 01:48:17.363
Oh. Thank you.

01:48:17.499 --> 01:48:20.033
Thank you. For saving my life.

01:48:21.396 --> 01:48:23.296
Well, I suppose
that concludes our business.

01:48:23.432 --> 01:48:26.434
I will now return
to my beloved Loompaland.

01:48:26.570 --> 01:48:30.740
Where the cocoa beans grow in
disappointingly small numbers,

01:48:30.875 --> 01:48:32.578
and my friends
look down on me.

01:48:32.714 --> 01:48:34.878
What? I thought
they called you Lofty.

01:48:35.014 --> 01:48:37.578
The truth is that
I am a quarter-inch

01:48:37.714 --> 01:48:39.813
below average.

01:48:39.949 --> 01:48:41.554
They call me Shorty-pants.

01:48:41.689 --> 01:48:43.520
But there it is.

01:48:43.655 --> 01:48:44.985
Good day to you, sir.

01:48:45.121 --> 01:48:46.858
Uh, it's a shame
you have to go.

01:48:47.624 --> 01:48:48.993
I said good day.

01:48:49.128 --> 01:48:50.839
If I'm gonna share
my chocolate with the world,

01:48:50.863 --> 01:48:52.165
I'm gonna need
more than a shop.

01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:53.300
I'm sure you will.

01:48:53.402 --> 01:48:54.701
I'm gonna need a factory.

01:48:54.836 --> 01:48:56.242
Yeah, well,
good luck with that.

01:48:56.266 --> 01:48:58.699
And someone to head up
the tasting department.

01:48:58.835 --> 01:49:00.202
