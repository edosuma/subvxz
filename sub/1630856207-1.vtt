an unusual interest

06:18.174 --> 06:19.769

you’ll be frozen solid.

06:36.522 --> 06:38.953
Oh, don’t be ridiculous.

06:38.953 --> 06:40.526
Ooh.

06:41.329 --> 06:42.759
Perhaps it is a little cold
for camping.

06:42.759 --> 06:46.763
But unfortunately,
I’m not in a position
to pay for a room, sir.

06:46.763 --> 06:50.206

- Mmm.

06:50.206 --> 06:51.768

06:56.311 --> 06:56.773
Really?

06:56.773 --> 06:59.380
- Here we are, Mr. Wonka.

06:59.380 --> 07:00.348

07:01.778 --> 07:04.451

off my front door,

07:04.451 --> 07:05.650
you mangy mutt.

07:05.650 --> 07:07.586
-  If that’s you,
Bleacher,

07:07.586 --> 07:08.620
you’d better have my gin.

07:08.620 --> 07:12.558
Oh, I have something better
than gin, Mrs. Scrubitt.

07:13.262 --> 07:15.363
A guest.

07:15.363 --> 07:16.331
Hmm.

07:16.331 --> 07:19.598
Oh! Well, why didn’t
you say?

07:19.598 --> 07:20.863
- Come on in, sir.

07:20.863 --> 07:24.669
Welcome to Scrubitt
and Bleacher’s
Guest House and Laundry.

07:24.669 --> 07:28.640
Make yourself at home,
warm your cockles by the fire.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.378
- Gin?
-  Oh.

07:30.378 --> 07:30.840
Noodle!

07:30.840 --> 07:31.907
Yes, Mrs. Scrubitt?

07:31.907 --> 07:34.448
Put that book down
and get our guest
a glass o’ gin.

07:34.448 --> 07:36.351
Poor man’s frozen
half to death.

07:36.351 --> 07:37.385
Thank you, Mrs. Scrubitt.

07:37.385 --> 07:39.849
You and your husband
have been so kind to me.

07:39.849 --> 07:40.850
Husband?

07:40.850 --> 07:42.016
Him?

07:42.016 --> 07:42.951
Husband.

07:42.951 --> 07:44.425
Oh, you’d love that,
wouldn’t ya?

07:44.425 --> 07:46.757
- No.
- Oh, I’m holding out
for someone

07:46.757 --> 07:49.265
far superior
to that idle peasant.

07:49.265 --> 07:52.499
- Chin-chin.

07:52.994 --> 07:56.404
That is
extremely strong stuff.

07:56.404 --> 07:57.702
Yeah, you can
run cars on that.

07:57.702 --> 08:00.837
So, what is it I can do
for you? Room, is it?

08:00.837 --> 08:02.740
Well, yes, but, uh...

08:02.740 --> 08:07.008
Mr. Wonka is temporarily
embarrassed.

08:07.008 --> 08:08.845
Oh, no. You don’t say.

08:08.845 --> 08:11.353
I’m afraid that’s true,
Mrs. Scrubitt.

08:11.353 --> 08:11.848
But...

08:11.848 --> 08:13.916
all that’s about to change.
- Oh, yeah?

08:13.916 --> 08:16.050
You see,
I’m something of a magician,

08:16.050 --> 08:17.689
inventor and chocolate maker.

08:17.689 --> 08:19.724
And first thing tomorrow
at the Galeries Gourmet,

08:19.724 --> 08:23.398
I plan to unveil
my most astonishing
creation yet.

08:23.398 --> 08:25.994
- Oh?
- Prepare to be amazed

08:25.994 --> 08:28.304
as I present to you...

08:29.569 --> 08:30.438
A teapot?

08:30.438 --> 08:31.967
No, that’s just
for making tea.

08:31.967 --> 08:34.673
- One second.

08:35.443 --> 08:37.874
That’s for my stew.

08:37.874 --> 08:39.348
It’s in here somewhere.

08:39.348 --> 08:42.417
Don’t you worry, Mr. Wonka.
I can see you’re a man
of great ingenuity.

08:42.417 --> 08:44.518
And we’ve got
just the thing for ya.

08:44.518 --> 08:45.849
The entrepreneurial package.

08:45.849 --> 08:47.455
Now, the room
is one sovereign a night,

08:47.455 --> 08:48.984
but you don’t have to pay
till 6:00 tomorrow.

08:48.984 --> 08:51.525
Does that give you enough time
to earn a few pennies?

08:51.525 --> 08:53.989
More than enough,
Mrs. Scrubitt.

08:53.989 --> 08:54.792
Thank you.

08:54.792 --> 08:57.630
Oh, it’s the least I can do
for a stranger in need.

08:57.630 --> 09:00.534
Now, sign here
and we’re all done.

09:00.534 --> 09:03.966
- All righty.

09:05.066 --> 09:08.102
Read the small print.

09:08.377 --> 09:08.872
What?

09:08.872 --> 09:11.611
Thank you, Noodle.
That’ll do.

09:11.611 --> 09:12.843
Ooh. What’d she say?

09:12.843 --> 09:14.042
Who’s that, then?
- The girl.

09:14.042 --> 09:15.780
What girl?
- That girl.
It sounded like,

09:15.780 --> 09:20.851
"Read the small print."
And there does seem
to be a lot of...

09:20.851 --> 09:23.986
Oh. Oh. Oh.

09:24.118 --> 09:26.021
Oh. Oh.

09:26.021 --> 09:27.891
Oh. Just keeps on coming.

09:27.891 --> 09:30.597
Yeah, you don’t wanna listen
to Noodle, Mr. Wonka.

09:30.597 --> 09:32.797
She’s damaged.
- Damaged?

09:32.797 --> 09:34.128
Orphan Syndrome.

09:34.128 --> 09:35.470
Orphan Syndrome?

09:35.470 --> 09:37.538
Orphan Syndrome.

09:37.538 --> 09:40.739
She was dropped down
the laundry chute as a bab,
and I took her in

09:40.739 --> 09:41.872
out the goodness
of my heart,

09:41.872 --> 09:43.973
and I’ve done my best,
Mr. Wonka, honest, I have,

09:43.973 --> 09:46.547
but she’s been left
with a suspicious nature.

09:46.547 --> 09:49.143
She sees conspiracy
everywhere.

09:49.143 --> 09:51.046
Poor girl.
- I know.

09:51.046 --> 09:52.817
These are just
your standard Ts and Cs,

09:52.817 --> 09:57.052
but you’re welcome
to take a look if you want.

09:57.052 --> 09:59.054
I’ll just give it a once-over.

10:06.831 --> 10:09.669
Well, that all seems
to be in order.

10:09.669 --> 10:10.703
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

10:10.703 --> 10:12.672
Hello.
- Ah!

10:12.672 --> 10:14.476
Then welcome to Scrubitt’s.

10:16.038 --> 10:19.415
There you are, Mr. Wonka.
The entrepreneurial suite.

10:19.415 --> 10:22.517
There’s your four-poster,
and your sink plus soap,

10:22.517 --> 10:24.046
and there’s a little mint
on your pillow.

10:24.046 --> 10:25.685
Fantastic.

10:25.685 --> 10:27.852
What kind people.

10:35.563 --> 10:37.730
Noodle!

10:38.192 --> 10:39.765
Oh, Noodle!

10:39.765 --> 10:40.865
Yes, Mrs. Scrubitt?

10:40.865 --> 10:42.702
I’ve been lookin’ for you.

10:42.702 --> 10:43.736
What do you want?

10:43.736 --> 10:45.771
I wanna teach you a lesson,
you miserable little bookworm.

10:45.771 --> 10:46.706
What did I do wrong?

10:46.706 --> 10:47.971
You know what you did,
you brat.

10:47.971 --> 10:49.940
- Stop squirming!
- What? No, please.

10:50.743 --> 10:52.613
You ever
interfere in my business again,

10:52.613 --> 10:55.583
and you’ll be
in this coop all week.
Do you understand?

10:55.583 --> 10:58.685
Yes, Mrs. Scrubitt.
Sorry, Mrs. Scrubitt.

10:58.685 --> 11:02.183
I should think so, too.

11:30.244 --> 11:33.082
Here we go, Mamma.

11:38.626 --> 11:42.630

13:21.124 --> 13:23.995
- Miss Bon-Bon?
- Yes, Mr. Slugworth.

13:23.995 --> 13:24.963
Call the police.

13:24.963 --> 13:26.228
Very good, sir.

13:26.228 --> 13:28.802
Well, who wants to try one?

13:28.802 --> 13:31.101
-  Me, please!
-  I will.

13:32.135 --> 13:34.775
Mr. Slugworth, sir.
-  ’Scuse me.

13:34.775 --> 13:35.842
Mr. Fickelgruber.

13:35.842 --> 13:38.240
- And Mr. Prodnose.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.076
What an honor.

13:39.076 --> 13:40.341
Ever since
I was a little boy...

13:40.341 --> 13:42.618
- That is quite a handshake.

13:42.618 --> 13:45.049
It’s a business handshake,
Mr. Wonka.

13:45.049 --> 13:47.854
Lets people know
I mean business.

13:47.854 --> 13:48.954
- Huh...
- Now, come along.

13:48.954 --> 13:54.124
Let’s try one of these
so-called Hoverchocs.

14:03.298 --> 14:04.739
Ooh.

14:04.739 --> 14:06.873
It’s not just chocolate,
is it?

14:06.873 --> 14:08.270
There’s...

14:08.270 --> 14:09.975
- marshmallow.
-  That’s right.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.406
Harvested from
the mallow marshes of Peru.

14:12.406 --> 14:14.408
And caramel.

14:14.408 --> 14:16.377
But... but it’s...
-  Salted.

14:16.377 --> 14:19.413
With the bittersweet tears
of a Russian clown.

14:19.413 --> 14:22.086
-  And is that...

14:22.086 --> 14:23.824
Surely not?

14:23.890 --> 14:24.352
Cherry?

14:24.352 --> 14:26.156
Cherry-picked by
the pick of the cherry pickers

14:26.156 --> 14:28.125
from the Imperial Gardens
in Japan.

14:28.125 --> 14:31.392
- Well, Mr. Wonka.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.900
I’ve been in this business
a very long time,

14:33.900 --> 14:34.901
and I can safely say

14:34.901 --> 14:38.135
that of all the chocolate
I have ever tasted,

14:38.135 --> 14:40.203
this is without doubt

14:40.203 --> 14:43.371
the absolute 100% worst.

14:43.371 --> 14:44.405
- Whoo!

14:44.405 --> 14:46.011
There we have it,
ladies and gentlemen.

14:46.011 --> 14:48.244
An endorsement from Mr...

14:48.244 --> 14:49.047
Wait. The worst?

14:49.047 --> 14:52.017
We three
are the fiercest of rivals,

14:52.017 --> 14:53.381
and yet we agree on one thing.

14:53.381 --> 14:55.988
A good chocolate
should be simple.

14:55.988 --> 14:57.385
Plain. Uncomplicated.

14:57.385 --> 15:01.059
Whereas this, with all
its bells and whistles...

15:01.059 --> 15:03.457
Well, it’s just...

15:03.457 --> 15:05.195
Weird.

15:05.393 --> 15:06.394
That’s a shame.

15:06.394 --> 15:09.969
- If you thought
the chocolate was weird,

15:09.969 --> 15:12.774
you’re gonna hate
what happens next.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.237
- Hmm?

15:14.237 --> 15:16.074
What’s happening?
Whoa, what’s going on?

15:16.074 --> 15:18.076
That’s the hoverfly.

15:18.076 --> 15:19.880
It’s broken
out of its cocoon.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.014
It’s flapping its wings
like billy-oh.

15:23.114 --> 15:25.919
My hair!
You mean a fly is doing this?

15:25.919 --> 15:27.052
Yes. But don’t worry.

15:27.052 --> 15:29.153
It’ll be completely unharmed.
- Oh, thank you.

15:29.153 --> 15:31.122
In about 20 minutes,
it’ll get tired

15:31.122 --> 15:33.091
and exit through your rear.

15:33.091 --> 15:33.894
You what?

15:33.894 --> 15:35.995
He means we’re going to
fart them out of our botties!

15:35.995 --> 15:37.766
Yes, I know what he meant.

15:37.766 --> 15:39.229
You’re off your rocker, Wonka!

15:39.229 --> 15:40.164
Who in their right mind

15:40.164 --> 15:41.770
wants a chocolate
that makes you fly?

15:41.770 --> 15:43.464
Well, let’s find out,
shall we?

15:43.464 --> 15:44.839
Who’s for a Hoverchoc?

15:44.839 --> 15:47.138
-  I want one!

15:47.138 --> 15:50.042
One sovereign, please.
Thank you.

15:50.042 --> 15:51.307
Thank you very much.

15:51.307 --> 15:53.749
One sovereign.
Thank you, madam.

15:53.749 --> 15:55.146
Enjoy your flight.

15:55.916 --> 15:58.886
Look, I’m flying!
I’m flying!

16:01.218 --> 16:03.759
How’s the view
up there?

16:03.825 --> 16:07.224
Not too high, darling!

16:09.325 --> 16:10.260
Beat it, kid.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.328
All right, folks.
Nothin’ to see here.

16:12.328 --> 16:16.904
Just a small group of people
defyin’ the laws of gravity.

16:16.904 --> 16:17.971
- Yeah.
- Hook ’em, boys.

16:17.971 --> 16:19.533
That’s the Hoverchoc,
sir. That’s the point.

16:19.533 --> 16:22.943
I’m afraid
we’ve had some complaints
about you, sir.

16:22.943 --> 16:23.878
Complaints?

16:23.878 --> 16:25.946
That you’re disrupting
the trade of other businesses.

16:25.946 --> 16:28.443
I’m regrettably obliged
to move you on

16:28.443 --> 16:29.950
and to confiscate

16:29.950 --> 16:31.083
- your earnings.

16:31.083 --> 16:32.887
Hey!
What are you doing?
-  No!

16:32.887 --> 16:34.383
Don’t worry,
it’s going to a good cause.

16:34.383 --> 16:36.418
-  Get off.
- Sick kids, or something.

16:36.418 --> 16:38.057
Sorry, sir. Rules is rules.

16:38.057 --> 16:39.487
Cheeky devil, you!
Come here!

16:39.487 --> 16:42.831
Could you at least
leave me a sovereign?

16:42.831 --> 16:45.130
I need to pay for my room.

16:47.297 --> 16:50.531
- Here.

16:51.235 --> 16:52.940
Thank you.

16:55.470 --> 16:58.077
Evening, Mr. Wonka.

16:58.374 --> 16:59.177
How’d it go?

16:59.177 --> 17:00.442
Not quite as well
as I’d hoped.

17:00.442 --> 17:03.885
Oh, shame. Well, I’m afraid
we do have to settle up now.

17:03.885 --> 17:07.086
Well, thankfully,
the room’s taken care of.

17:07.086 --> 17:08.923
Believe we said a sovereign.

17:08.923 --> 17:09.825
For the room, yes.

17:09.825 --> 17:12.355
But you have incurred
a few extras

17:12.355 --> 17:16.161
during the course of your
residency with ourselves.

17:16.161 --> 17:19.131
- Have I?
- Yes, you have.

17:19.131 --> 17:22.431
There was that glass of gin
you had on arrival,

17:22.431 --> 17:23.597
and if I remember rightly,

17:23.597 --> 17:26.336
you warmed your cockles
by the fire.

17:26.336 --> 17:27.502
He did indeed, Mrs. Scrubitt.

17:27.502 --> 17:30.175
- Cockle-warming is extra, see?

17:30.175 --> 17:32.441
Used the stairs
to get to his room, and all.

17:32.441 --> 17:34.377
Oh, then
you’ve got your stair charge,

17:34.377 --> 17:37.886
and that is per step,
I’m afraid. Up and down.

17:37.886 --> 17:39.019
Now, tell me, Mr. Wonka,

17:39.019 --> 17:41.890
did you happen
to use the mini bar?

17:41.890 --> 17:43.023
There’s a minibar?

17:43.023 --> 17:44.255
Mini bar of soap.

17:44.255 --> 17:45.091
By the sink.

17:45.091 --> 17:46.961
Uh... I might have, briefly.
- Oh-ho!

17:46.961 --> 17:49.392
See? Even Bleacher knows
you never touch the mini bar,

17:49.392 --> 17:51.900
and he was raised in a ditch.

17:51.900 --> 17:53.231
Add in your mattress hire,

17:53.231 --> 17:55.332
your linen lease,
and your pillow penalty,

17:55.332 --> 17:57.499
and you are looking at...

17:57.499 --> 17:59.138
Ten thousand sovereigns.

17:59.138 --> 18:00.304
You gotta be kidding me?

18:00.304 --> 18:02.878
It’s all in the small print, dearie.

18:02.878 --> 18:04.572
I don’t have
10,000 sovereigns.

18:05.540 --> 18:07.311
Then we have a problem,
Mr. Wonka.

18:07.311 --> 18:08.576
You’re gonna
have to work it off

18:08.576 --> 18:10.886
in the Wash House, ain’t ya?

18:10.886 --> 18:12.217
At a sovereign a day.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.185
Ten thousand days is...

18:13.185 --> 18:14.450
Twenty-seven years.

18:14.450 --> 18:15.616
- Hey!
-  Four months.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.057
And 16 days.

18:22.623 --> 18:24.493
-  Ah.

18:24.493 --> 18:27.562
You must be
Mr. Wonka.
- Who are you?

18:27.562 --> 18:31.434
Abacus Crunch,
chartered accountant.

18:31.434 --> 18:32.468
At least, I was.

18:32.468 --> 18:34.305
- Now, uh...
- He runs the place.

18:34.305 --> 18:37.242
And you best do as he says,
or you’ll answer to me.

18:37.242 --> 18:39.046
Piper Benz. Plumber by trade.

18:39.046 --> 18:41.609
This is
Miss Lottie Bell.

18:41.609 --> 18:43.116
Hi.

18:43.116 --> 18:44.051
She don’t talk much.

18:44.051 --> 18:48.484
And I’m Larry Chucklesworth!

18:48.484 --> 18:49.419
Comedian.

18:49.419 --> 18:50.255
Hmm.

18:50.255 --> 18:52.224
So they got all of you, too,
did they?

18:52.224 --> 18:53.324
I’m afraid so.

18:53.324 --> 18:54.589
We each of us found ourselves

18:54.589 --> 18:56.030
in need of a cheap place
to stay,

18:56.030 --> 18:58.362
and neglected
to read the small print.

18:58.362 --> 19:02.663
One moment of stupidity,
followed by endless regret.

19:02.663 --> 19:06.634
Sounds like my third marriage.

19:06.700 --> 19:08.471
I’m sorry, I do that a lot.

19:08.471 --> 19:09.604
He does.
- A lot.

19:09.604 --> 19:11.573
I’ve only
been married once,

19:11.573 --> 19:12.640
and it didn’t work out.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.312
There’s gotta be
some way outta here.

19:14.312 --> 19:15.577
You don’t think
we’ve tried?

19:15.577 --> 19:18.052
There are bars on the window
and there’s a dog on the door.

19:18.052 --> 19:19.680
And even
if you could get out,

19:19.680 --> 19:20.956
that contract is watertight.

19:20.956 --> 19:24.388
If you’re not here
at roll call, Mrs. Scrubitt
will call the police,

19:24.388 --> 19:25.488
they’ll bring you right back,

19:25.488 --> 19:28.029
and she’ll charge you
a thousand
for the inconvenience.

19:28.689 --> 19:30.361
All right, everybody.
Back to work.

19:30.361 --> 19:31.560
- Come along, Mr. Wonka.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.596
- You come with me.

19:34.596 --> 19:38.171
You’re in here. On suds.

21:42.427 --> 21:45.166
Told you to read
the small print.

21:45.463 --> 21:47.663
Slight problem with that.

21:48.466 --> 21:50.204
You can’t read, can you?

21:50.204 --> 21:54.406
I focused my studies
almost exclusively
on chocolate.

21:54.406 --> 21:55.374
I see.

21:55.374 --> 21:58.245
For everything else,
I’ve relied on the kindness
of strangers.

21:58.245 --> 22:02.843
And look
where that’s got you.
The staff quarters.

22:03.184 --> 22:04.746
You’ve got a bed.

22:07.254 --> 22:09.124
You had a bed.

22:09.124 --> 22:13.293
Desk, and a wash basin/toilet.

22:13.293 --> 22:14.327
- Ugh.
- The water comes

22:14.327 --> 22:17.594
in two temperatures. Cold...

22:17.594 --> 22:19.530
...and colder.

22:20.267 --> 22:22.236
How much do you owe them?

22:22.236 --> 22:23.270
Ten thousand.

22:23.270 --> 22:25.734
Count yourself lucky.
I owe 30.

22:25.734 --> 22:27.604
What? How do you
owe them money?

22:27.604 --> 22:30.442
I thought they found you
down a laundry chute.

22:30.442 --> 22:31.311
Oh, they did.

22:31.311 --> 22:33.148
Took me in out of the goodness
of their hearts

22:33.148 --> 22:35.744
and charged me
for the privilege.

22:35.744 --> 22:36.778
What a pair of monsters.

22:36.778 --> 22:40.320
The greedy beat the needy
every time, Mr. Wonka.

22:40.320 --> 22:42.322
Guess it’s just
the way of the world.

22:42.322 --> 22:43.521
Oh, come on, Noodle.

22:43.521 --> 22:46.755
That’s just your
Orphan Syndrome talking.

22:46.755 --> 22:48.823
- My what?
- Your Orphan Syndrome.

22:48.823 --> 22:52.695
And we are not gonna
be eating any slops.

22:52.695 --> 22:54.235
What are you doing?

22:54.235 --> 22:55.863
I’m making chocolate,
o’ course.

22:55.863 --> 22:56.897
How do you like it? Dark?

22:56.897 --> 23:00.208
White? Nutty?
Absolutely insane?

23:00.208 --> 23:01.407
I don’t know.

23:01.407 --> 23:03.838
I’ve never had any.

23:03.838 --> 23:06.907
You’ve never had chocolate?

23:06.907 --> 23:08.513
- No.
-  What?

23:08.513 --> 23:10.779
You’ve never had chocolate?

23:10.878 --> 23:11.780
Still no.

23:11.780 --> 23:14.651
Well, this is unbelievable.
I mean, this is outrageous.

23:14.651 --> 23:16.884
Well, lucky for you, Noodle,
I have a selection

23:16.884 --> 23:18.523
of the world’s
finest ingredients

23:18.523 --> 23:20.624
right here
in my travel factory.

23:26.234 --> 23:26.762
Whoa.

23:26.762 --> 23:29.435
Where to begin?
That’s the question.

23:29.435 --> 23:30.667
I know!

23:30.667 --> 23:31.470
Silver Linings.

23:31.470 --> 23:34.638
Made of condensed
thunder clouds

23:34.770 --> 23:36.673
and liquid sunlight.

23:36.673 --> 23:39.313
Helps you see
that faint ray o’ hope

23:39.313 --> 23:41.447
beyond the shadow of despair.

23:41.447 --> 23:42.349
Just what we need,

23:42.349 --> 23:43.746
- wouldn’t you say?

23:43.746 --> 23:45.748
Did you always
wanna make chocolate?

23:45.748 --> 23:47.651
No.

23:47.651 --> 23:49.290
Back when I was your age,

23:49.290 --> 23:51.358
I wanted to be a magician.

23:51.358 --> 23:53.327
My mom was a cook.

23:53.327 --> 23:55.791
We lived on the river,
just the two of us.

23:55.791 --> 24:00.235
In a perfect little
world of our own.

24:00.994 --> 24:03.271
The way I remember it,
I used to spend

24:03.271 --> 24:04.734
every waking hour
trying to come up

24:04.734 --> 24:08.540
with some new trick
to impress my mom.

24:08.837 --> 24:10.575
Bravo!

24:10.575 --> 24:14.480
But the real magic
came from her.

24:14.975 --> 24:17.945
We didn’t have a lotta money,
but each week,

24:17.945 --> 24:19.881
she brought home
one cocoa bean.

24:19.881 --> 24:21.619
And by the time my birthday
came around,

24:21.619 --> 24:25.623
there was enough to make
a single bar o’ chocolate.

24:25.623 --> 24:28.923
But it wasn’t
just any old chocolate.

24:28.923 --> 24:30.694
Far from it.

24:30.694 --> 24:33.763
This has to be
the best chocolate
in the world.

24:33.763 --> 24:35.369
Oh,
don’t know about that.

24:35.369 --> 24:37.998
They say the very best
comes from a place

24:37.998 --> 24:39.703
called the Galeries Gourmet.

24:39.703 --> 24:43.344
Theirs can’t be any better
than yours, Mamma.

24:43.344 --> 24:44.642
It’s impossible.

24:44.642 --> 24:47.810
Well, as it so happens,

24:47.810 --> 24:49.416
I do know a little secret

24:49.416 --> 24:52.848
that even
those fancy-pants don’t.

24:53.354 --> 24:54.388
What is it?

24:54.388 --> 24:55.015
I’ll tell ya.

24:55.015 --> 24:59.426
When you’re older.
Now get to sleep.

25:05.025 --> 25:06.664
We should go, Amma.

25:06.664 --> 25:07.896
Where’s that, then?

25:07.896 --> 25:10.063
To the Galeries Gourmet.
- What?

25:10.063 --> 25:11.801
And start a shop?
- Yeah.

25:11.801 --> 25:14.705
With our name above the door
and everything.

25:14.705 --> 25:17.840
That’s a wonderful dream, honey.

25:17.906 --> 25:20.546
Is that all it is?

25:21.008 --> 25:23.384
Just a dream?

25:24.418 --> 25:25.914
Hey now.

25:27.487 --> 25:32.492
Every good thing in this world
started with a dream.

25:32.492 --> 25:33.955
So you hold on to yours.

25:33.955 --> 25:36.694
And when you do share
chocolate with the world,

25:36.694 --> 25:40.863
oh, I’ll be right there
beside ya.

25:40.863 --> 25:41.600
Promise?

25:41.600 --> 25:42.700
Do better than that.

25:42.700 --> 25:45.967
I pinkie promise.

25:47.606 --> 25:48.871
Now,

25:48.871 --> 25:50.510
sleep.

25:52.413 --> 25:55.845
So, what was it, Willy?

25:55.845 --> 25:57.847
What was the secret?

25:57.847 --> 26:00.487
I never found out.

26:00.817 --> 26:02.918
Soon after, she fell sick.

26:02.918 --> 26:08.429
And before I knew it,
all I had left
was her bar of chocolate.

26:12.026 --> 26:13.896
That’s why I’m here, Noodle.

26:13.896 --> 26:17.504
So I can feel the same way
I did back then,

26:17.504 --> 26:20.067
eating chocolate with her.

26:20.903 --> 26:21.838
What do you mean?

26:21.838 --> 26:24.874
My mom once promised
that when I share chocolate
with the world,

26:24.874 --> 26:27.107
she’d be right there
beside me.

26:28.416 --> 26:30.748
I know it sounds crazy,
but I always hoped

26:30.748 --> 26:33.146
she’d somehow
keep that promise.

26:34.015 --> 26:37.425
She might even
tell me her secret.

26:42.925 --> 26:45.125
Here. Try one.

27:02.813 --> 27:04.947
Wish you hadn’t done that.

27:04.947 --> 27:07.818
You don’t like it?
- No,

27:07.818 --> 27:11.052
I like it. It’s just...

27:11.184 --> 27:12.053
What?

27:12.053 --> 27:16.431
Now each day
I don’t have chocolate
will be a little harder.

27:16.431 --> 27:21.161
Then how would you like
to have all the chocolate
you can eat, every day,

27:21.161 --> 27:22.833
for the rest of your life?

27:22.833 --> 27:23.999
A lifetime supply?

27:23.999 --> 27:26.441
A lifetime supply.

27:26.441 --> 27:27.167
What would I have to do?

27:27.167 --> 27:29.004
Not much.
Just get me out of here.

27:29.004 --> 27:30.676
Are you crazy?
- Shh!

27:30.676 --> 27:32.612
It’s easy. I’ll get someone
to cover my shift,

27:32.612 --> 27:34.449
and you could smuggle me out
in your laundry cart.

27:34.449 --> 27:35.813
- But I...
- Just for a few hours, mind.

27:35.813 --> 27:37.749
No one will even know
I was gone.

27:37.749 --> 27:38.849
What’s the point of that?

27:38.849 --> 27:40.917
To sell chocolate, o’ course!
We’ll split the profits

27:40.917 --> 27:42.721
and pay off Mrs. Scrubitt
in no time.

27:42.721 --> 27:43.656
It’s a nice idea, Willy.

27:43.656 --> 27:45.757
- It’s a great idea.
- But it’ll never work.

27:45.757 --> 27:47.726
’Course it will.
Eat your chocolate.

27:47.726 --> 27:48.859
You don’t understand.

27:48.859 --> 27:51.829
Mrs. Scrubitt’s like a hawk.
She keeps her beady eye
on everything

27:51.829 --> 27:55.767
that comes in and out
of the Wash House except...

27:56.196 --> 27:57.802
Huh.

27:57.868 --> 27:59.540
What is it?

27:59.540 --> 28:01.003
No, it’s nothing.

28:01.003 --> 28:02.807
Oh, okay.

28:02.906 --> 28:03.577
Huh.

28:03.577 --> 28:04.842
Double-huh!
That’s not nothing.

28:04.842 --> 28:06.547
That’s the Silver Lining.
It’s given you an idea.

28:06.547 --> 28:09.044
Okay. So, the one time
she dropped her guard

28:09.044 --> 28:11.112
was when this aristocrat
came to the laundry.

28:11.112 --> 28:13.114
He was only
asking for directions,

28:13.114 --> 28:15.721
but she was all over him
like a rash.

28:15.721 --> 28:17.085
It was disgusting.

28:17.085 --> 28:17.987
That’s it, Noodle.

28:17.987 --> 28:19.626
All we have to do
is find an aristocrat

28:19.626 --> 28:21.958
and slip out
while she’s distracted.

28:21.958 --> 28:22.992
Yeah, but...

28:22.992 --> 28:26.567
where are we going
to find an aristocrat?

28:29.031 --> 28:30.098
Huh.

28:30.098 --> 28:31.704
Huh?

28:32.100 --> 28:33.035
Huh.

28:33.035 --> 28:33.871
A double-huh.

28:33.871 --> 28:35.235
Do you have
a pencil and paper?

28:35.235 --> 28:38.744
- Uh-huh.
- I got an idea.

28:57.125 --> 28:59.699
I’ve come
to make a confession.

29:01.569 --> 29:05.034
You sound great, fellas.
Keep it up.

29:08.807 --> 29:12.305
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

29:12.877 --> 29:17.816
I have had 150 of these
since my last confession.

29:19.279 --> 29:23.118
Temptation is very hard
to resist.

29:26.022 --> 29:27.661
Mmm.

29:27.661 --> 29:29.828
Send me down.

29:29.927 --> 29:33.568
- I’ll see you later.

29:37.836 --> 29:40.575
Good evening, Chief.

29:40.674 --> 29:41.741
They’re all waiting.

29:41.741 --> 29:43.809
Thank you very much.

29:44.744 --> 29:47.208
Good evening, gentlemen.
I’ve brought my invoice.

29:47.208 --> 29:51.850
One chocolatier moved on
for the usual fee.

29:51.850 --> 29:53.148
Oh.

29:53.148 --> 29:54.281
Here we go, baby.

29:54.281 --> 29:55.656
There’s the good stuff. Yeah.

29:55.656 --> 29:57.284
Tell me, Chief...
Mm-hmm?

29:57.284 --> 30:00.089
...how would you like
to earn a few more of those?

30:00.089 --> 30:01.123
Oh, I am listening.

30:01.123 --> 30:02.729
We think
that Mr. Wonka

30:02.729 --> 30:07.063
might require a little more
than simply moving on.

30:07.063 --> 30:09.032
- Oh.
-  He’s good.

30:09.032 --> 30:10.165
Too good.

30:10.165 --> 30:11.001
And what’s more,

30:11.001 --> 30:13.234
he only charges
a sovereign a chocolate.

30:13.234 --> 30:17.139
So anyone can afford them,
even the...

30:18.272 --> 30:19.746
You know, the...

30:19.746 --> 30:22.012
- The poor?
-  Oh, dear.

30:22.012 --> 30:25.048
I’ve just been
a little bit sick in my mouth.

30:25.048 --> 30:26.819
Could you please refrain
from mentioning

30:26.819 --> 30:28.249
that demographic
in my presence?

30:28.249 --> 30:30.152
He doesn’t like it
when people say "poor."

30:30.152 --> 30:31.923
-  Sorry, Felix.

30:31.923 --> 30:35.091
We want you to send
Wonka a message.

30:35.091 --> 30:36.697
Backed up by physical force.

30:36.697 --> 30:39.667
That if he attempts to sell
chocolate in this town again,

30:39.667 --> 30:43.704
he is liable to meet
with a little accident.

30:43.704 --> 30:45.970
In which he dies.

30:45.970 --> 30:47.367
Yeah, no, I...
I got that already.

30:47.367 --> 30:48.841
You don’t have
to keep saying it.

30:48.841 --> 30:50.975
I’m just making sure
we’re all on the same page.

30:50.975 --> 30:52.042
Well, no one’s on your page.

30:52.042 --> 30:54.011
What’s that supposed to mean?
Well, I know what it means...

30:54.011 --> 30:55.078
Actually, what does it mean?

30:55.078 --> 30:57.311
Gentlemen, please.

30:58.015 --> 30:59.984
So, what do you say, Chief?

30:59.984 --> 31:00.886
Do we have a deal?

31:00.886 --> 31:03.790
Well, listen, fellas,
I’m an officer of the law.

31:03.790 --> 31:08.322
I can’t just go around
roughin’ up your competition.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.665
I’m sorry.

31:10.896 --> 31:11.699
Well now, Chief.

31:13.800 --> 31:16.704
I can see that
you’re a man of integrity.

31:18.937 --> 31:19.839

You what?

33:38.175 --> 33:40.342
Don’t tell me
you hadn’t noticed.

33:40.342 --> 33:41.112
What?

33:41.112 --> 33:43.081
She’s madly in love with you.

33:43.081 --> 33:44.885
Mrs. Scrubitt?

33:44.885 --> 33:45.985
Besotted.

33:45.985 --> 33:48.251
And why not? Look at you.

33:48.251 --> 33:49.219
Fine figure of a man.

33:49.219 --> 33:51.859
You just need to tidy
yourself up a little bit.

33:51.859 --> 33:53.553
Get some new clothes.

33:53.553 --> 33:55.357
Have a bath.

33:55.357 --> 33:56.028
A bath?

33:56.028 --> 33:59.163
You do know
what they say, right?

33:59.900 --> 34:00.593
What do they say?

34:00.593 --> 34:02.397
She’ll be thankful
for an ankle.

34:02.397 --> 34:05.037
- Yes.
- And pleased to see your knees.

34:05.037 --> 34:06.137
- Right.
- But if you wanna

34:06.137 --> 34:08.271
make her sigh...
- Tell me.

34:08.271 --> 34:10.537
Show her some thigh.

34:11.879 --> 34:12.913
Bleacher!

34:12.913 --> 34:14.277
It’s overflowing now.

34:14.277 --> 34:16.180
Get in there. Back to work.
- All right.

34:16.180 --> 34:17.577
It’s up to me ankles!

34:17.577 --> 34:19.480
- Time-waster.

34:19.480 --> 34:21.185
- Bleacher!

34:21.185 --> 34:24.221
Curse that idle peasant.

34:32.559 --> 34:34.495
What you got there?

34:34.495 --> 34:36.233
Nothing.

34:36.299 --> 34:39.203
Do you like that coop, Noodle?

34:39.203 --> 34:39.973
All right.

34:39.973 --> 34:43.306
I was collecting laundry
from Professor Monocle
the other day.

34:43.306 --> 34:44.010
Yeah.

34:44.010 --> 34:46.540
He’s writing a book about
the Bavarian Royal Family.

34:46.540 --> 34:47.211
Boring.

34:47.211 --> 34:49.950
He’s got sketches of noblemen
all over his wall.

34:49.950 --> 34:50.412
So?

34:50.412 --> 34:53.283
This one
looked rather familiar.

34:54.647 --> 34:55.318
Oh.

34:55.318 --> 34:57.958
Blow me.
That looks exactly like...

34:57.958 --> 34:59.289
Mr. Bleacher.

34:59.289 --> 35:03.557
Are you telling me Bleacher
is a Bavarian aristocrat?

35:03.557 --> 35:05.361
- Uh-huh.

35:05.361 --> 35:07.330

with your hair?

35:49.207 --> 35:50.439
Maybe not.

35:53.442 --> 35:54.707
Where’d you get

35:54.707 --> 35:57.985
-  Lost property.

do they suit me?

36:00.581 --> 36:03.221
- Yeah.

36:03.221 --> 36:05.388
Not bad, I suppose.

36:06.389 --> 36:08.193
What’re you doing
all the way over there?

36:08.193 --> 36:10.459
- Keeping my knees warm.

36:26.607 --> 36:28.279
a brand-new contraption

Chasing after mailmen.

36:35.583 --> 36:38.553

please don’t make me

36:51.137 --> 36:53.172

Tiddles has agreed to...

36:53.172 --> 36:56.241
- ♪ Scrub, scrub ♪

36:56.241 --> 36:59.343
So, tell me all about Bavaria.

36:59.343 --> 37:01.015
- Where?
- Where you’re from.

37:01.015 --> 37:03.281
Oh, yes. It’s very...

37:03.281 --> 37:06.251
- ...Bavarian.
-  Oh, whoo.

37:11.652 --> 37:13.126
All clear.

37:13.126 --> 37:14.424
Really?
- Yeah.

37:14.424 --> 37:16.558
We did it! Well done, Noodle.

37:16.558 --> 37:17.592
I can’t believe it worked.

37:17.592 --> 37:19.726
Wait till you see how much
chocolate I made last night.

37:19.726 --> 37:23.037
We sell this,
and we’re gonna be...

37:23.631 --> 37:24.797
Oh, no.

37:24.797 --> 37:26.469
What’s going on, Willy?

37:26.469 --> 37:27.305
Not again.

37:27.305 --> 37:28.339
Where are the chocolates?

37:28.339 --> 37:31.441
I don’t know how to tell you
this, Noodle, but...

37:31.441 --> 37:32.805
they’ve been stolen.

37:32.805 --> 37:34.543
- Stolen?
- Mm-hmm.

37:34.543 --> 37:35.610
Who by?

37:35.610 --> 37:38.415
The Little Orange Man.

37:38.415 --> 37:39.119
What?

37:39.119 --> 37:41.550
The Little Orange Man.
I didn’t tell you about him?

37:41.550 --> 37:43.090
No, ya didn’t.

37:43.090 --> 37:45.191
He’s my nemesis.
About yea high.

37:45.191 --> 37:46.456
Comes in the dead
of the night,

37:46.456 --> 37:47.721
and he steals
all my chocolate.

37:47.721 --> 37:51.692
Been happening every few weeks
for the past three,
four years now.

37:51.692 --> 37:52.495
Really?

37:52.495 --> 37:53.430
Sometimes I spy him

37:53.430 --> 37:55.630
in that strange realm
’twixt sleep and wake,

37:55.630 --> 37:57.830
green hair glinting
in the moonlight.

37:57.830 --> 37:58.732
Green hair?

37:58.732 --> 38:00.470
One day I shall
catch him, Noodle.

38:00.470 --> 38:01.669
- Willy.
- When I do...

38:01.669 --> 38:02.571
Willy!
- Hmm?

38:02.571 --> 38:04.738
You don’t seriously expect me
to believe this, do you?

38:04.738 --> 38:07.807
Of course I do. What other
explanation is there?

38:07.807 --> 38:08.643
I don’t know,

38:08.643 --> 38:10.216
that you go to sleep...
- Mm-hmm.

38:10.216 --> 38:11.547
...dream ’bout
Little Green Man...

38:11.547 --> 38:12.680
Orange man, green hair. Yeah.

38:12.680 --> 38:14.088
...and while you’re dreaming,

38:14.088 --> 38:16.222
stuff your face
with chocolate!

38:16.222 --> 38:18.125
Stuff my...

38:18.191 --> 38:19.258
That makes a lot more sense.

38:19.258 --> 38:20.490
Why’d I ever think
this would work?

38:20.490 --> 38:22.129
I’ve been eating
all my own chocolate?

38:22.129 --> 38:23.658
- Stupid Silver Linings.
- I don’t think I have been.

38:23.658 --> 38:24.329
Hey!

38:24.329 --> 38:25.759
There’s nothing stupid
about my chocolate.

38:25.759 --> 38:28.267
If Mrs. Scrubitt
had spotted us,

38:28.267 --> 38:30.137
I’d be in the coop right now.

38:30.137 --> 38:31.303
Look, I’m sorry, okay?

38:31.303 --> 38:32.865
But we can make
more chocolate.

38:32.865 --> 38:35.505
Only problem is
I’m all out of milk.

38:35.505 --> 38:38.343
Well, that’s not a problem.

38:38.409 --> 38:40.378
Milk.

38:40.378 --> 38:42.677
A, that is stealing.

38:42.677 --> 38:43.381
And C,

38:43.381 --> 38:45.713
Willy Wonka does not use
any old cow’s milk.

38:45.713 --> 38:46.813
For this particular creation,

38:46.813 --> 38:49.717
I require the milk
of a giraffe.

38:49.717 --> 38:50.784
Okay... fine.

38:50.784 --> 38:53.490
As a matter of fact,
there’s one at the zoo.

38:53.490 --> 38:54.260
Bingala!

38:54.260 --> 38:56.856
But A,
the zoo is not that way.

38:56.856 --> 38:58.132
Great.

38:58.132 --> 38:58.627
And B,

38:58.627 --> 39:01.564
they’re not gonna let you just
walk in there and milk it.

39:01.564 --> 39:05.436
Mm. That, my dear Noodle,
is why we’re very lucky

39:05.436 --> 39:09.407
the Little Orange Man
didn’t find this.

39:13.477 --> 39:14.280
What is it?

39:14.280 --> 39:15.380
From Zoo Management.

39:15.380 --> 39:18.746
In recognition
of your years of service.

39:18.746 --> 39:21.518
But I’ve only
been here a year.

39:21.584 --> 39:26.193
Which is why
there’s only one chocolate.

39:26.556 --> 39:27.491
Huh.

39:27.491 --> 39:28.690
Well, thank you very much.

39:28.690 --> 39:31.660
You’re welcome.
Good night!

39:32.298 --> 39:33.761
Hey, well done, Noodle.

39:33.761 --> 39:35.730
So, what is it really?

39:35.730 --> 39:37.204
It’s called A Big Night Out.

39:37.204 --> 39:38.667
A single chocolate
that perfectly mimics

39:38.667 --> 39:40.537
a night on the town.
-  Mmm.

39:40.537 --> 39:43.408
The outer layer,
a champagne truffle.

39:43.408 --> 39:44.409
That’s lovely.

39:44.409 --> 39:46.279
The next is white wine.

39:46.279 --> 39:47.346
Mmm.

39:47.346 --> 39:48.347
Followed by red.

39:48.347 --> 39:49.546
Now we are talking!

39:49.546 --> 39:51.284
That’s when the singing
and dancing starts.

39:51.284 --> 39:53.715
♪ We’re gonna
Have a party tonight!♪

39:53.715 --> 39:57.191
It’s when he hits
the layer o’ whiskey fudge
he’ll get emotional.

39:57.191 --> 39:59.952
She was
the only woman I ever loved!

39:59.952 --> 40:02.394
He might do
something reckless.

40:02.394 --> 40:03.527
I’ll give her a call.

40:03.527 --> 40:06.332
What harm could it do?

40:06.332 --> 40:07.861
Hello, Gwennie? It’s Basil.

40:07.861 --> 40:10.765
I just wanted to say,
I’ve always loved you.

40:10.765 --> 40:13.306
I love you so much. What?

40:13.306 --> 40:14.208
It’s Basil Bond.

40:14.208 --> 40:15.869
We sat together
in chemistry at school.

40:15.869 --> 40:16.936
No, no, don’t hang up!

40:16.936 --> 40:20.643
Finally, some old port
from the back
of the cupboard, and...

40:23.415 --> 40:24.350
Hmm.

40:24.350 --> 40:26.451
Let’s go.

40:26.451 --> 40:28.387
Noodle, let’s go.

40:29.553 --> 40:30.818
Why don’t they
fly away?

40:30.818 --> 40:34.294
I don’t know.
Perhaps they haven’t
thought of it.

40:34.294 --> 40:36.593
You’re kidding?
No, I’m serious.

40:36.593 --> 40:37.924
That’s the thing
about flamingos.

40:37.924 --> 40:40.597
They need someone
to show ’em the way.

40:40.597 --> 40:42.368
Huh.

40:45.602 --> 40:47.604
Giraffe.

40:47.736 --> 40:51.641
Giraffe. Giraffe.

40:52.609 --> 40:54.677
Ah! Giraffe.

40:59.583 --> 41:02.256
You have got to learn
how to read.

41:02.256 --> 41:02.817
Why?

41:02.817 --> 41:04.390
You were nearly
eaten by a tiger.

41:04.390 --> 41:05.721
"Nearly" is the key word
there, Noodle.

41:05.721 --> 41:07.525
I’ve nearly been eaten
by a lot of things,

41:07.525 --> 41:10.396
and none of them
got more than a nibble.

41:11.859 --> 41:12.860
Giraffe.

41:12.860 --> 41:15.335
Okay, I’ll learn how to read.

41:33.947 --> 41:37.951
Good evening,
Miss, um...

41:37.951 --> 41:40.327
Abigail.
-  Abigail.

41:40.954 --> 41:42.725
Whoa! Easy, now.

41:42.725 --> 41:44.892
I brought acacia mints.

41:51.030 --> 41:51.800
Oh.

41:51.800 --> 41:54.836
Giraffes are just crazy
about my acacia mints.

41:54.836 --> 41:56.475
Love ’em more
than anything else.

41:56.475 --> 41:59.709
Except being scratched
under the chin, you see?

42:01.315 --> 42:03.383
You wanna
give it a go, Noodle?

42:03.383 --> 42:04.648
Me?

42:04.648 --> 42:06.848
Yeah. Why not?

42:07.750 --> 42:09.653
Okay.

42:14.020 --> 42:15.054
- Ugh!
-  Oh!

42:15.054 --> 42:18.497
Think she likes you.

42:19.091 --> 42:20.433
Miss Abigail,

42:20.433 --> 42:22.897
if my colleague here
gives you a good scratch,

42:22.897 --> 42:24.899
do you think you could
possibly spare us

42:24.899 --> 42:27.341
a pint or two of your milk?

42:30.905 --> 42:33.743
So, have you done
this before?

42:33.743 --> 42:36.680
Once. In Africa.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.451
Magnificent beast.

42:38.451 --> 42:41.014
Was she wild?
Wild?

42:41.014 --> 42:43.489
She was absolutely furious.

42:43.489 --> 42:45.051
You sure can be silly, Willy.

42:45.051 --> 42:48.087
I suppose that’s true-dle,
Noodle.

42:48.087 --> 42:49.528
True-dle?

42:49.528 --> 42:51.024
That doesn’t work, does it?

42:51.024 --> 42:52.564
Nothing rhymes with Noodle.

42:52.564 --> 42:55.600
Where’d you get that name, anyway?

42:55.600 --> 42:57.096
Doesn’t matter.

42:57.503 --> 42:58.999
No, go on.

43:01.375 --> 43:02.871
This.

43:03.377 --> 43:06.138
It’s all I have
of my real parents. See?

43:06.138 --> 43:10.945
"N" for Noodle.
Or Nora, or Nina,

43:11.143 --> 43:13.013
or nothing at all.

43:13.013 --> 43:14.553
Can’t you trace the owner?

43:14.553 --> 43:16.819
You don’t think I’ve tried?

43:17.116 --> 43:18.656
When I was a kid,

43:18.656 --> 43:21.428
I always hoped
that I’d find my parents.

43:21.428 --> 43:25.465
And they’d live
in this beautiful old building
full of books.

43:25.465 --> 43:29.964
My mom, she’d be waiting there
for me at the door,

43:29.964 --> 43:30.998
and I’d run into her arms.

43:30.998 --> 43:35.706
She’d give me this big hug
like she’d never let me go.

43:36.740 --> 43:40.645
But then I realized
it was just a stupid dream.

43:42.042 --> 43:44.682
There’s nothing stupid
about that.

43:44.682 --> 43:45.650
Isn’t there?

43:45.650 --> 43:48.719
I know things haven’t
been easy for you, Noodle.

43:48.719 --> 43:49.819
But they’re gonna get better.

43:49.819 --> 43:53.823
I’m not gonna let you rot
in that Wash House forever.

43:53.823 --> 43:54.824
You promise?

43:54.824 --> 43:57.563
I can do better than that.

43:58.025 --> 43:58.993
I pinkie promise.

43:58.993 --> 44:01.996
And that’s the most
solemn vow there is.

44:04.966 --> 44:05.802
Get scratchin’.

44:05.802 --> 44:10.004
We don’t have long
until that guard comes
to-dle, Noodle.

44:10.004 --> 44:13.777
- To-dle!
- It’s not even a word!

44:13.843 --> 44:14.580
Oh.

44:14.580 --> 44:16.747
I’m gonna keep working on it.

A word in private, if I may.

47:17.026 --> 47:18.093
Certainly, Officer.

47:18.093 --> 47:20.293
- Be on your way, Affable.
-  Are you sure, sir?

47:20.293 --> 47:23.230
Oh, yeah.
This is between
me and Mr. Wonka.

47:23.230 --> 47:24.803
You better
get outta here, Noodle.

47:24.803 --> 47:26.134
- But Willy...
- Don’t worry about me.

47:26.134 --> 47:27.839
I’ve talked my way out
of tighter spots than this.

47:27.839 --> 47:29.973
I’ll meet you
back at the cart.

47:30.072 --> 47:32.745
Now, Officer,
if this is about Abigail...

47:32.745 --> 47:34.681
I got a message for you, pal.

47:34.681 --> 47:35.374
Whoa! No.

47:36.309 --> 47:40.247
Do not sell chocolate
in this town!

47:40.247 --> 47:42.953
- You got it?

47:43.657 --> 47:44.691
Not really, I’m afraid.

47:44.691 --> 47:48.222
Oh, so you got a mouth on you,
huh, Candy Man?

47:48.222 --> 47:48.992
I said...

47:48.992 --> 47:52.765
- Don’t sell chocolate!

47:53.700 --> 47:55.295
You hear me that time?

47:55.295 --> 47:57.935
I have water in my ears.

47:58.100 --> 47:58.936
Oh.

47:58.936 --> 48:00.773
Yeah, that... You’ve...

48:00.773 --> 48:03.072
Okay, that makes sense. Yeah.

48:03.072 --> 48:05.140
Listen, I’m sorry.

48:05.140 --> 48:06.713
I’m all outta whack.

48:06.713 --> 48:09.309
Truth is, I don’t wanna
be doin’ this.

48:09.309 --> 48:11.146
I don’t want you
to be doing this.

48:11.146 --> 48:12.950
But I still gotta
give ya a message.

48:12.950 --> 48:14.919
Sell chocolate
in this town again,

48:14.919 --> 48:17.724
you’re gonna get more
than a bonk on the head.

48:17.724 --> 48:19.726
I don’t have
a bonk on the head.

48:21.354 --> 48:23.356
What is with me today? I...

48:23.356 --> 48:26.227
Can you give me
just a second?
- Sure.

48:28.460 --> 48:29.901
Lord Bleachowitz.

48:29.901 --> 48:34.741
Mrs. Scrubitt.
Your eyes are like
two rabbit droppings

48:34.741 --> 48:35.709
in a couple of bowls

48:35.709 --> 48:36.842
- of custard.
- Oh!

48:36.842 --> 48:38.811
You really do have a way
with words.

48:38.811 --> 48:41.176
See you downstairs.

48:41.176 --> 48:43.013
Geronimo!

48:43.013 --> 48:44.718
Ah, Mr. Wonka.

48:44.718 --> 48:46.115
Good of you to join us.

48:46.115 --> 48:48.788
Not late, am I?
-  Well, no.

48:48.788 --> 48:50.053
Cutting it a bit fine, but...

48:50.053 --> 48:51.384
Has Tiddles been
pulling his weight?

48:51.384 --> 48:52.957
- As a matter of fact,

48:52.957 --> 48:54.090
Tiddles has been
a very good boy,

48:54.090 --> 48:56.092
and productivity is up 30%.

48:56.092 --> 48:57.489
We took
the afternoon off.

48:57.489 --> 48:59.227
But that’s not the point.

48:59.227 --> 49:00.426
This is the point.

49:00.426 --> 49:01.966
Not now, Larry.
- Sorry.

49:01.966 --> 49:03.737
The point is...

49:03.737 --> 49:04.463
Where have you been?

49:04.463 --> 49:07.367
And why do you smell
of giraffe?

49:07.367 --> 49:08.973
Guess I owe you guys
an explanation.

49:08.973 --> 49:11.206
Mm.
The truth is,

49:11.206 --> 49:12.339
I’m a chocolate maker.

49:12.339 --> 49:15.243
Not just any chocolate.
The best in the world.

49:15.243 --> 49:18.884
Ah, well,
Noodle’s flattering me,
but she’s right.

49:18.884 --> 49:19.786
They’re exquisite.

49:19.786 --> 49:22.789
Plan is to sell chocolate
and pay off Mrs. Scrubitt.

49:22.789 --> 49:25.418
At least,
that was the plan, until...

49:25.418 --> 49:26.320
Oh, let me guess.

49:26.320 --> 49:30.192
You had a little run-in
with the Chief of Police?

49:30.192 --> 49:31.193
How do you know that?

49:31.193 --> 49:34.526
Because I was
Slugworth’s accountant.

49:34.526 --> 49:35.934
For a week, at least.

49:35.934 --> 49:37.529
His regular bookkeeper
was off sick.

49:37.529 --> 49:39.333
- Station, please.
-  And I was called

49:39.333 --> 49:42.270
halfway across the country
to take his place.

49:42.270 --> 49:44.008
Good evening, Mr. Slugworth.

49:44.008 --> 49:47.011
I just need
your signature on...

49:47.011 --> 49:49.442
Seemed a straightforward job.

49:49.442 --> 49:50.311
Oh.

49:50.311 --> 49:52.214
Until I realized

49:52.214 --> 49:54.920
there were two sets of books.

49:54.920 --> 49:56.955
One for the authorities,

49:56.955 --> 49:59.551
and one which told the truth.

49:59.551 --> 50:03.423
Slugworth, Fickelgruber,
and Prodnose

50:03.423 --> 50:05.293
have been in cahoots
for years.

50:05.293 --> 50:08.065
A sort of chocolate cartel,
if you will.

50:08.065 --> 50:10.265
They’ve been watering down
their chocolate

50:10.265 --> 50:13.400
and storing the excess
in a secret vault

50:13.400 --> 50:14.973
deep beneath the cathedral,

50:14.973 --> 50:18.240
guarded round the clock
by a corrupt cleric

50:18.240 --> 50:21.914
and 500 chocoholic monks.

50:21.914 --> 50:26.017
The only way in is down
a secret elevator, and past

50:26.017 --> 50:28.382
the Mistress of the Keys.

50:28.382 --> 50:30.417
A subterranean sentinel...

50:30.417 --> 50:32.826
...who hasn’t seen
sunlight in years.

50:32.826 --> 50:34.223
Good evening.

50:34.223 --> 50:36.060
There’s thousands
of gallons of chocolate

50:36.060 --> 50:39.426
down there, and the Cartel
use it to bribe,

50:39.426 --> 50:42.132
blackmail, and bludgeon
the competition.

50:42.132 --> 50:44.838
I do not care that
they were school children...

50:44.838 --> 50:48.237
...they were in our way.
Next time, put your foot down.

50:48.237 --> 50:49.073
Miss Bon-Bon?

50:49.073 --> 50:50.503
Good morning, Mr. Slugworth.

50:50.503 --> 50:53.572
From now on, I’ll be keeping
the ledger in the vault.

50:53.572 --> 50:55.882
Very good, sir.

50:56.509 --> 50:58.412
Oh, and Mr. Crunch?

50:59.611 --> 51:00.513
Yes?

51:00.513 --> 51:02.548
You’re fired.

51:04.154 --> 51:05.892
Very good, sir.

51:06.321 --> 51:07.894
I’m sorry, Mr. Wonka,

51:07.894 --> 51:10.963
but they’ve got you
right where they want you.

51:10.963 --> 51:13.625
You can’t get a shop
without selling chocolate,

51:13.625 --> 51:18.069
and you can’t sell chocolate
without a shop.

51:20.874 --> 51:22.469
Hey, Noodle!

51:22.469 --> 51:24.240
Noodle! Psst!

51:25.472 --> 51:27.045
What is it, Willy?

51:27.045 --> 51:28.310
Watch out.

51:28.310 --> 51:29.608
Whoa!

51:34.646 --> 51:35.614
What’s this for?

51:35.614 --> 51:39.585
Your wages.
A lifetime supply, remember?

51:39.585 --> 51:41.059
You didn’t have to do that.

51:41.059 --> 51:44.898
Of course I did.
I gave you my word.

51:45.030 --> 51:46.328
Well, thanks.

51:46.328 --> 51:50.299
I’ve got something
for you, too.
- For me?

51:55.634 --> 51:56.437
What’s this?

51:56.437 --> 51:59.506
Glass half full?
- Other way up.

51:59.506 --> 52:00.980
Glass half empty.

52:00.980 --> 52:03.510
It’s an "A."
Your first letter.

52:03.510 --> 52:05.985
I’m teaching you to read.

52:05.985 --> 52:06.579
Oh, Noodle.

52:06.579 --> 52:09.681
Well, I can’t have
my business partner
eaten by a tiger.

52:09.681 --> 52:11.419
Or nearly eaten.

52:11.419 --> 52:12.387
So we’re still partners?

52:12.387 --> 52:14.653
Sure, but I don’t know
how we’re gonna
sell any chocolate.

52:14.653 --> 52:19.328
Every time the police show up,
you’d have to vanish
into thin air.

52:19.328 --> 52:20.527
Like a magician.

52:20.527 --> 52:21.363
Right!

52:21.363 --> 52:23.365
Yeah, but it’s one thing
when you’re onstage.

52:23.365 --> 52:26.236
You have ropes and pulleys
and trapdoors.

52:26.236 --> 52:27.501
There’s none of those
on the street.

52:27.501 --> 52:29.503
As a matter of fact,
there are.

52:29.503 --> 52:32.110
There are trapdoors
all over the city.

52:32.110 --> 52:33.606
They’re called storm drains.

52:33.606 --> 52:35.113
I’d be happy
to show you around

52:35.113 --> 52:36.279
if you cut me in
on the action.

52:36.279 --> 52:38.116
-  If you’re recruiting,

52:38.116 --> 52:40.019
I’d do anything
to get out of here

52:40.019 --> 52:41.053
and make up with my wife.

52:41.053 --> 52:43.484
I don’t have
any practical skills, but,

52:43.484 --> 52:46.157
I can talk
like I’m under water.

52:46.157 --> 52:49.457
And if you need someone
to handle communications,

52:49.457 --> 52:51.162
I’m your woman.

52:51.162 --> 52:52.559
Lottie?

52:52.559 --> 52:54.330
What? Why you all
staring at me?

52:54.330 --> 52:56.101
I did not know
she could speak.

52:56.101 --> 52:58.268
I thought you were a mime.
-  No,

52:58.268 --> 53:01.073
I actually used to work
at the telephone exchange.

53:01.073 --> 53:04.670
But back then,
I was quite the chatterbox.

53:04.670 --> 53:06.980
But since I came here,

53:07.112 --> 53:08.575
I haven’t had much
to chat about.

53:08.575 --> 53:10.544
-  Far be it from me

53:10.544 --> 53:12.315
to pour cold water
on all your fun,

53:12.315 --> 53:15.120
but if Mrs. Scrubitt
catches you trying to escape,

53:15.120 --> 53:18.354
you’ll all get six months
in the coop.

53:18.354 --> 53:19.322
So just think about that

53:19.322 --> 53:22.523
before getting involved
in this harebrained scheme.

53:22.523 --> 53:25.031
But it’s not harebrained,
Abacus.

53:25.031 --> 53:27.726
Willy’s chocolates
are incredible.

53:27.726 --> 53:28.496
Try one.

53:28.496 --> 53:30.069
That’s very kind
of you, Noodle.

53:30.069 --> 53:34.007
I don’t care how good
his chocolates are.

53:35.008 --> 53:37.076
When do we start?

53:46.745 --> 53:49.154
I guess what I’m trying
to say, Barbara, is, um,

53:49.154 --> 53:52.388
- will you marry me?
-  Oh.

53:52.388 --> 53:53.191
I dunno, Colin.

53:53.191 --> 53:55.028
You’re a lovely man,
but I’m looking for someone

53:55.028 --> 53:56.326
to sweep me off my feet.
You know,

53:56.326 --> 53:59.494
whisk me off
to a life of adventure.

53:59.494 --> 54:01.562
Could that be you?

54:01.760 --> 54:02.794
- No.
- Oh.

54:02.794 --> 54:05.500
Not with my chronic
lack of self-confidence.

54:05.500 --> 54:08.206
Uh, I best be off.
- Oh, but Colin...

54:08.206 --> 54:11.242
Sorry to have
wasted your time, Barbara.

54:11.242 --> 54:13.211

01:00:15.705 --> 01:00:17.410

How dare you.

01:00:24.450 --> 01:00:26.177
that I am a perfectly
respectable size

01:00:26.177 --> 01:00:28.586

01:00:28.586 --> 01:00:29.521
An Oompa-what-now?

01:00:29.521 --> 01:00:32.788
In fact, in Loompaland,
I am regarded
as something of a whopper.

01:00:32.788 --> 01:00:34.460
They call me Lofty.

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:36.627
So, I will thank you
to stop gawping at me

01:00:36.627 --> 01:00:37.892

something unpleasant

in your handkerchief.

01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:43.436

and, frankly, rude.

01:00:43.436 --> 01:00:44.503
Um...

01:00:44.503 --> 01:00:45.933
- Sorry.
- Now let me out of here.

01:00:45.933 --> 01:00:47.440
You have absolutely no right

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:50.542

embottling innocent strangers.

01:00:50.542 --> 01:00:51.103
Innocent?

01:00:51.103 --> 01:00:53.974

01:03:52.823 --> 01:03:55.056
we don’t need
to sell chocolate today.

01:03:55.056 --> 01:03:55.958
And why is that?

01:03:55.958 --> 01:03:57.025
You know that shop?

01:03:57.025 --> 01:03:59.764
The one you’ve
been dreaming of?

01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:16.748
Now, I know
what you’re thinking.

01:04:16.748 --> 01:04:19.916
It may need a little work.

01:04:20.851 --> 01:04:22.380
Looks like someone
left the water running

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:24.184
twenty years ago
and the ceiling fell through.

01:04:24.184 --> 01:04:27.154
And the ceiling above that,
and the ceiling above that.

01:04:27.154 --> 01:04:29.926
But that means
we can afford it.

01:04:29.926 --> 01:04:31.026
For a week, anyway.

01:04:31.026 --> 01:04:32.929
And we’d finally
be legitimate.

01:04:32.929 --> 01:04:34.898
The police wouldn’t
have any excuse

01:04:34.898 --> 01:04:36.768
to keep bothering us.

01:04:36.768 --> 01:04:39.969
So,
what do you think, Willy?

01:04:39.969 --> 01:04:41.707
Do you like it?

01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:45.271
Do I like it?

01:04:47.042 --> 01:04:48.945
Noodle, it’s just
as I always imagined.

01:04:48.945 --> 01:04:52.817
No, scratch that,
it’s better than I imagined.

01:04:52.817 --> 01:04:53.884
I mean, look at this place.

01:04:53.884 --> 01:04:56.381
I mean, yeah, it’s a wreck,
but... the potential!

01:04:56.381 --> 01:04:57.690
The bones!

01:04:57.690 --> 01:05:00.187
You mark my words,
this is gonna
be the best chocolate shop

01:05:00.187 --> 01:05:01.826
the world has ever seen.
- Whoo!

01:05:01.826 --> 01:05:03.762
You won’t be scrub-scrubbin’
much longer, Noodle.

01:05:03.762 --> 01:05:05.863
-  We’ll all be free.

01:05:05.863 --> 01:05:07.700
As free as flamingos!

01:05:19.173 --> 01:05:21.241
There’s six of them
in total.

01:05:21.241 --> 01:05:22.275
Including the little girl.

01:05:22.275 --> 01:05:24.310
She seems to be the brains
of the operation.

01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:28.149
They’re based out of a laundry
called Scrubitt and Bleacher.

01:05:28.149 --> 01:05:30.250
Scrubitt’s?

01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:32.318
That’s right. Why, you know it?

01:05:32.318 --> 01:05:34.892
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I do.

01:05:34.892 --> 01:05:36.091
They just
rented a shop.

01:05:36.091 --> 01:05:38.390
So, legally, I can’t
touch them. But illegally,

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:40.964
I’m happy to do
whatever you guys want.

01:05:40.964 --> 01:05:43.032
You want ’em all
to have a little accident?

01:05:43.032 --> 01:05:44.363
In which they die?

01:05:44.363 --> 01:05:45.232
Not a problem.

01:05:45.232 --> 01:05:47.399
But it’s gonna cost you
a lot more chocolate.

01:05:47.399 --> 01:05:48.367
It’s all right, Chief.

01:05:48.367 --> 01:05:50.501
And also, I’d, uh,
be grateful for an advance.

01:05:50.501 --> 01:05:53.746
’Cause the last boxes
you gave me...

01:05:53.746 --> 01:05:55.143
they’re gone.

01:05:55.143 --> 01:05:55.946
All of them?

01:05:55.946 --> 01:05:57.277
I’ve been eating
these little paper cases

01:05:57.277 --> 01:05:58.850
for the... for the past
three days.

01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:01.314
You know, you think they’re
gonna give you the same hit.

01:06:01.314 --> 01:06:03.481
They don’t.

01:06:03.481 --> 01:06:04.416
Oh.

01:06:04.416 --> 01:06:05.890
There you go, Chief.

01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:08.189
There’s plenty more
where that came from.

01:06:08.189 --> 01:06:09.927
You stand down for now.

01:06:09.927 --> 01:06:12.127
We’ll give you a call
when the time is right.

01:06:18.331 --> 01:06:19.464
What is it, Arthur?

01:06:19.464 --> 01:06:20.432
The girl.

01:06:20.432 --> 01:06:23.941
You don’t really think
it could be her, do you?

01:06:24.403 --> 01:06:25.107
I do.

01:06:25.107 --> 01:06:28.407
You always assured us
she wouldn’t be a problem.

01:06:28.407 --> 01:06:30.816
He’s right. You did assure us.

01:06:30.816 --> 01:06:32.411
And she won’t be.

01:06:32.411 --> 01:06:33.544
Nor will Wonka.

01:06:33.544 --> 01:06:36.547
I’ll see to it, personally.

01:06:39.088 --> 01:06:41.552
Who is it?
What d’you want?

01:06:44.159 --> 01:06:46.557
Mr. Slugworth.

01:06:46.557 --> 01:06:48.801
Just a minute, sir.

01:06:49.362 --> 01:06:50.198
Good evening.

01:06:50.198 --> 01:06:53.465
- Good evening.
-  Who is it,
puffy-wu...

01:06:53.465 --> 01:06:55.302
-  Stone me.

01:06:55.302 --> 01:06:56.237
It’s Mr. Slugworth.

01:06:56.237 --> 01:06:58.877
To what do we owe the honor?

01:06:58.877 --> 01:07:01.308
You have a guest.
A Mr. Wonka?

01:07:01.308 --> 01:07:03.211
He’s been sneaking out
to sell chocolate

01:07:03.211 --> 01:07:05.180
with the help
of your serving girl.

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:07.050
Why, that little brat.

01:07:07.050 --> 01:07:08.018
Well, quite.

01:07:08.018 --> 01:07:12.286
I wondered if you might
help me put an end to their...

01:07:12.352 --> 01:07:14.123
business.

01:07:22.901 --> 01:07:25.233
Here we go, Mamma.

01:07:33.439 --> 01:07:37.377
Ladies and gentlemen,
greetings to you all,

01:07:37.377 --> 01:07:40.314
and welcome to Wonka’s.

01:07:40.314 --> 01:07:42.349
Tremendous things
are in store,

01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:46.254
both literally
and metaphorically.

01:07:46.254 --> 01:07:47.585
What?

01:07:47.585 --> 01:07:49.356
In there?

01:07:49.994 --> 01:07:51.424

So, mushrooms,
pears, assorted flowers.

01:11:27.277 --> 01:11:30.346
That comes to 89 sovereigns.

01:11:30.346 --> 01:11:32.843
A bargain at twice the price.

01:11:32.843 --> 01:11:33.646
Thank you, sir.

01:11:33.646 --> 01:11:36.253
And how would
you like your change?

01:11:36.253 --> 01:11:38.321
Spendable or edible?

01:11:38.321 --> 01:11:40.653
Oh, edible, please.

01:11:41.522 --> 01:11:42.820
Enjoy.

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:46.230
And, uh, don’t forget
to eat your basket.

01:11:46.230 --> 01:11:47.264
Oh.

01:11:47.264 --> 01:11:50.168
Abacus, that man just
gave us 100 sovereigns.

01:11:50.168 --> 01:11:52.764
I know, Noodle!

01:11:52.764 --> 01:11:53.666
Who’s next?

01:11:53.666 --> 01:11:55.173
That’ll be me.
Me!

01:11:59.771 --> 01:12:00.772
Uh...

01:12:00.772 --> 01:12:02.147
Mr. Wonka?

01:12:02.147 --> 01:12:03.643
Yes?

01:12:03.874 --> 01:12:05.711
What’s going on here?

01:12:05.711 --> 01:12:07.185
Oh, my goodness.

01:12:07.185 --> 01:12:08.549
That’s impossible.

01:12:08.549 --> 01:12:10.386
Unless...

01:12:13.191 --> 01:12:15.424
Yeti sweat?

01:12:15.424 --> 01:12:17.591
The most powerful
hair potion in the world.

01:12:17.591 --> 01:12:19.494
But I didn’t put it in there.

01:12:19.494 --> 01:12:22.200
Ladies and gentlemen!
Your attention, please!

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.631
There appears
to be a manufacturing error.

01:12:24.631 --> 01:12:26.567
Nobody eat the flowers!

01:12:26.567 --> 01:12:28.602
Uh, why not?

01:12:28.602 --> 01:12:29.537
What’s wrong with them?

01:12:29.537 --> 01:12:31.242
What’s the matter
with this toadstool?

01:12:31.242 --> 01:12:33.640
My daughter took one bite,
and just look at her!

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.577
There’s nothing wrong
with the chocolate milk,

01:12:36.577 --> 01:12:37.347
is there?

01:12:37.347 --> 01:12:38.447
I’m terribly sorry, everyone,

01:12:38.447 --> 01:12:40.152
and I don’t know
how to explain this, but...

01:12:40.152 --> 01:12:42.682
it appears that the chocolates
have been poisoned!

01:12:42.682 --> 01:12:43.782
- Poisoned?

01:12:43.782 --> 01:12:45.652
- Poisoned?
- He poisoned my child!

01:12:45.652 --> 01:12:47.687
I didn’t...
I didn’t poison them.

01:12:47.687 --> 01:12:49.524
I want my money back.

01:12:49.524 --> 01:12:50.855
I want compensation.

01:12:50.855 --> 01:12:52.824
I want revenge.

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:54.793
Whoa!

01:13:00.271 --> 01:13:01.800
No, no! Please!

01:13:05.771 --> 01:13:09.775
This is what you get for
mustach-ing my daughter!

01:13:11.381 --> 01:13:15.220
I’ll wait for you.
Help! I have
to get away from this place.

01:13:15.913 --> 01:13:17.717
And that, I believe,

01:13:17.717 --> 01:13:21.853
is the end
of Wonka’s Chocolate Shop.

01:13:40.476 --> 01:13:42.775
I don’t understand.
What...

01:13:44.678 --> 01:13:45.943
What...

01:13:46.581 --> 01:13:47.549
What happened?

01:13:47.549 --> 01:13:49.419
Isn’t it obvious?

01:13:49.419 --> 01:13:51.982
The Chocolate Cartel.

01:13:53.819 --> 01:13:56.888
It’s okay, Willy.
We can rebuild.

01:13:56.888 --> 01:13:58.263
We can start again.

01:13:58.263 --> 01:14:00.595
There’s no point, Noodle.

01:14:01.464 --> 01:14:03.334
It didn’t work.

01:14:03.334 --> 01:14:04.599
What do you mean?

01:14:04.599 --> 01:14:07.470
She promised
she would be here.

01:14:08.801 --> 01:14:09.967
She wasn’t.

01:14:09.967 --> 01:14:12.409
You didn’t actually
think that...

01:14:12.409 --> 01:14:13.938
No, I did.

01:14:16.281 --> 01:14:16.941
Stupid dream.

01:14:16.941 --> 01:14:19.548
Don’t say that, Willy.
Please don’t ever...

01:14:19.548 --> 01:14:21.286
Come on, Noodle.

01:14:21.286 --> 01:14:25.015
I think Mr. Wonka
needs to be alone.

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:41.471
Every good thing
in this world
started with a dream.

01:14:43.968 --> 01:14:46.740
So you hold on to yours.

01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:52.317
And when
you do share chocolate
with the world, oh...

01:14:52.944 --> 01:14:56.585
I’ll be right there beside ya.

01:14:57.553 --> 01:15:01.293
Terrible shame,
what happened here.

01:15:02.426 --> 01:15:03.757
Take it you’re
responsible?

01:15:03.757 --> 01:15:06.826
Us? Oh, no.
Well, not personally.

01:15:06.826 --> 01:15:10.566
We may have
encouraged Mrs. Scrubitt

01:15:10.566 --> 01:15:12.370
to enhance your creations.

01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:13.668
We paid her
to poison them.

01:15:13.668 --> 01:15:17.375
Yes,
thank you, Gerald.
You’re welcome.

01:15:17.375 --> 01:15:19.003
So why have you come?

01:15:19.003 --> 01:15:20.906
- To gloat?
- Oh, no, Mr. Wonka,

01:15:20.906 --> 01:15:23.414
I don’t waste my time
with that sort of thing.

01:15:23.414 --> 01:15:26.417
We’ve come
to offer you a deal.

01:15:26.417 --> 01:15:32.082
This is the precise amount
you owe Mrs. Scrubitt.

01:15:32.082 --> 01:15:35.723
This is for
the number cruncher,

01:15:35.921 --> 01:15:37.395
the plumber,

01:15:37.395 --> 01:15:39.529
the telephonist,

01:15:39.529 --> 01:15:43.335
the so-called funny-man,

01:15:43.335 --> 01:15:45.535
and this...

01:15:46.635 --> 01:15:47.570
is for the girl.

01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:49.638
Now, we put in
a bit extra for her.

01:15:49.638 --> 01:15:51.937
So that she can
get a place to live,

01:15:51.937 --> 01:15:53.774
clothes, toys...

01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:56.480
books.

01:15:56.810 --> 01:15:58.713
Oh, yes, Mr. Wonka.

01:15:58.713 --> 01:16:04.521
You could change her life.
Change all their lives.

01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:07.524
And what would I have to do?

01:16:07.689 --> 01:16:09.460
Leave town.

01:16:09.625 --> 01:16:11.561
Oh, and, um,

01:16:11.693 --> 01:16:14.894
never make chocolate again.

01:16:14.894 --> 01:16:17.061
There’s a boat
sailing at midnight.

01:16:17.061 --> 01:16:19.668
And for their sake,
as much as your own,

01:16:19.668 --> 01:16:22.704

01:17:21.928 --> 01:17:23.666
To the North Pole.

01:17:23.666 --> 01:17:25.030
It’s premium economy.

01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:26.702
Yeah,
it’s basically economy.

01:17:26.702 --> 01:17:28.638
I mean, yeah,
you get a little more legroom.

01:17:28.638 --> 01:17:30.541
A complimentary
packet of peanuts.

01:17:30.541 --> 01:17:31.509
Is it worth the extra?

01:17:31.509 --> 01:17:34.941
I don’t know.
But these guys...

01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:37.746

to go into detail.

Oh, I’m not going to let you
out of my sight, Willy Wonka.

01:18:53.085 --> 01:18:54.625
Not till you’ve
paid your debt.

01:18:54.625 --> 01:18:58.530
But I bring glad tidings
on that score.

01:18:58.530 --> 01:18:59.256
What’s that?

01:18:59.256 --> 01:19:01.027
I’ve been doing my sums.

01:19:01.027 --> 01:19:03.260
One more jar, and we’re even.

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:06.703
Or, if you prefer,
I will accept half a jar

01:19:06.703 --> 01:19:08.705
of those rather
amusing Hoverchocs.

01:19:08.705 --> 01:19:10.806
- You’re outta luck.

01:19:10.806 --> 01:19:11.972
I don’t make chocolate
anymore.

01:19:11.972 --> 01:19:16.207
Oh, dear, please don’t tell me
you’re going to go through
with this ridiculous deal?

01:19:16.207 --> 01:19:17.241
I have to.

01:19:17.241 --> 01:19:19.045
For Noodle.

01:19:19.045 --> 01:19:21.817
I promised her a better life.

01:19:22.048 --> 01:19:22.950
I pinkie promised.

01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:24.886
You should stand up
to those bullies.

01:19:24.886 --> 01:19:26.019
Give ’em the old one-two.

01:19:26.019 --> 01:19:29.055
That’s what
an Oompa Loompa would do.

01:19:31.057 --> 01:19:32.091
But if you are determined

01:19:32.091 --> 01:19:35.160
to just sit there
feeling sorry for yourself,

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.931
I am going flat.

01:19:36.931 --> 01:19:38.669
Good night, sir.

01:19:47.238 --> 01:19:48.338
Huh.

01:19:51.275 --> 01:19:54.179
What is it?

01:19:54.179 --> 01:19:54.982
No, nothing.

01:19:54.982 --> 01:19:58.689
Well, it’s obviously something
because you said, "Huh."

01:19:58.689 --> 01:20:01.021
I’m sorry. Forget it.

01:20:01.351 --> 01:20:05.025
- Very well.

01:20:09.062 --> 01:20:09.733
Huh.

01:20:09.733 --> 01:20:11.130
Oh, you did it again.

01:20:11.130 --> 01:20:12.736
Tell me what it is,
or I shall poke you

01:20:12.736 --> 01:20:14.034
quite viciously
with a cocktail stick.

01:20:14.034 --> 01:20:16.135
Look. Where Slugworth
shook my hand.

01:20:16.135 --> 01:20:17.972
His ring left a mark. See?

01:20:17.972 --> 01:20:19.875
It’s an "A,"
surrounded by "S"s.

01:20:19.875 --> 01:20:22.746
So what?
His name is Arthur Slugworth.

01:20:22.746 --> 01:20:24.110
It’s probably a family ring.

01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:26.277
Yes, but Noodle has one
just like it.

01:20:26.277 --> 01:20:27.146
- Noodle?
- Uh-huh.

01:20:27.146 --> 01:20:31.315
Why would Noodle the orphan
have a Slugworth family ring?

01:20:31.315 --> 01:20:33.889
There’s only one reason
I can think of.

01:20:33.889 --> 01:20:34.659
Which is?

01:20:34.659 --> 01:20:36.254
And if I’m correct, Noodle
could be in grave danger.

01:20:36.254 --> 01:20:38.630
Well, come on, Wonka.
Spit it out.

01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:40.258
Produce your owl pellet
of wisdom.

01:20:40.258 --> 01:20:42.260
There’s no time.
I gotta get back.

01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:43.734
Captain!
- Wonka?

01:20:43.734 --> 01:20:48.002
Come back here. Wonka!
I demand an explanation.

01:20:48.002 --> 01:20:49.333
Captain?

01:20:49.872 --> 01:20:54.404
On second thoughts,
the explanation can wait.

01:20:54.404 --> 01:20:56.175
Good day to you.

01:21:04.656 --> 01:21:05.382
Well, gentlemen,

01:21:05.382 --> 01:21:09.419
one dead chocolatier,
as requested.

01:21:10.695 --> 01:21:11.322
Miss Bon-Bon?

01:21:11.322 --> 01:21:13.126
Yes, Mr. Slugworth?

01:21:13.126 --> 01:21:15.667
Give the chief his chocolate.

01:21:23.268 --> 01:21:24.775
My, my.

01:21:24.775 --> 01:21:27.041
What a lot o’ long faces
this morning.

01:21:27.041 --> 01:21:30.308
It’s almost as though you lot
had a sneaky little scheme

01:21:30.308 --> 01:21:32.112
to try and wriggle out
of your contracts.

01:21:32.112 --> 01:21:35.753
Which spectacularly misfired.

01:21:35.753 --> 01:21:38.151
But I’ve got some good news
for you lot,

01:21:38.151 --> 01:21:39.185
not that you deserve it.

01:21:39.185 --> 01:21:43.695
Your friend, Mr. Wonka,
done a deal with Mr. Slugworth.

01:21:43.695 --> 01:21:44.190
What?

01:21:44.190 --> 01:21:48.799
Gave up on his dream
to settle your accounts.

01:21:48.865 --> 01:21:51.230
Mr. Crunch.
- Present.

01:21:54.398 --> 01:21:56.301
You’re free to go.

01:21:57.170 --> 01:21:58.006
Scram, bookworm.

01:21:58.006 --> 01:21:59.711
Bell.
Hello.

01:21:59.711 --> 01:22:01.306
Sling yer hook.

01:22:01.306 --> 01:22:02.010
Benz.

01:22:02.010 --> 01:22:04.111
You ain’t gotta tell me twice.

01:22:04.111 --> 01:22:05.277
Chucklesworth.

01:22:05.277 --> 01:22:07.378
You’ve been
a terrible audience.

01:22:07.378 --> 01:22:08.181
Good night!

01:22:08.181 --> 01:22:09.919
Yeah, well, you ain’t been
much of a comedian, mate.

01:22:09.919 --> 01:22:12.053
I know.
- Hey, Larry.

01:22:12.053 --> 01:22:15.287
Keep going.
You’ve got something.

01:22:15.287 --> 01:22:16.156
You scare me.

01:22:16.156 --> 01:22:19.489
And finally, Noodle.

01:22:19.489 --> 01:22:21.964
Biggest pile o’ the lot.

01:22:21.964 --> 01:22:24.197
But this isn’t
to pay your bill.

01:22:24.197 --> 01:22:26.804
This is to keep you here.

01:22:26.804 --> 01:22:28.102
What do you mean?

01:22:28.102 --> 01:22:30.269
My friend, Mr. Slugworth,

01:22:30.269 --> 01:22:32.876
doesn’t think
nasty little urchins like you

01:22:32.876 --> 01:22:34.273
should be out on the streets,

01:22:34.273 --> 01:22:35.846
lowering the tone.

01:22:35.846 --> 01:22:37.342
So, he gave me this money

01:22:37.342 --> 01:22:41.214
to keep you down
in the Wash House for good.

01:22:41.214 --> 01:22:44.151
And I’m only
too happy to oblige.

01:22:44.151 --> 01:22:45.383
- I hate you!
-  Hey!

01:22:45.383 --> 01:22:46.857
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:22:46.857 --> 01:22:48.518
Look at her go,
Lord Bleachowitz.

01:22:48.518 --> 01:22:50.223
- Lord Bleachowitz?

01:22:50.223 --> 01:22:53.028
You don’t still think
he’s a lord, do you?

01:22:53.028 --> 01:22:53.765
What?

01:22:53.765 --> 01:22:55.866
We made it up,
you stupid old hag.

01:22:55.866 --> 01:22:57.230
She’s...
she’s lying.

01:22:57.230 --> 01:22:59.969
Right, that’s it,
you horrible little brat.

01:22:59.969 --> 01:23:02.906
You’re goin’ in the coop,
my girl.

01:23:02.906 --> 01:23:05.909
And you!
Take them dungarees off,

01:23:05.909 --> 01:23:09.143
you... you peasant.

01:23:09.143 --> 01:23:11.112
But Puffy-wuffy.

01:23:11.112 --> 01:23:13.048
I wuv you.

01:23:39.338 --> 01:23:40.372
Hello, Noodle.

01:23:40.372 --> 01:23:44.442
Willy.
I thought you’d gone.

01:23:44.508 --> 01:23:45.212
I did.

01:23:45.212 --> 01:23:46.543
Slugworth promised you
a better life,

01:23:46.543 --> 01:23:49.546
but he didn’t exactly
keep his side of the bargain.

01:23:49.546 --> 01:23:51.218
So I came back. We all did.

01:23:51.218 --> 01:23:52.483
Hey, Noodle.
How do?

01:23:52.483 --> 01:23:54.188
Hey.
Surprise!

01:23:54.188 --> 01:23:56.256
He wants me
locked up forever.

01:23:56.256 --> 01:23:57.895
Yeah, well, that figures.

01:23:57.895 --> 01:23:59.930
Why? What’s he got against me?

01:23:59.930 --> 01:24:01.294
I don’t know, Noodle.
Not for sure.

01:24:01.294 --> 01:24:04.231
All I know for certain
is that you won’t be safe
until Slugworth

01:24:04.231 --> 01:24:07.102
- is behind bars.

01:24:07.102 --> 01:24:10.303
And how exactly
is that supposed to happen?

01:24:10.303 --> 01:24:12.074
Abacus.
You said the Cartel keep

01:24:12.074 --> 01:24:13.845
a record
of all their dirty deeds.

01:24:13.845 --> 01:24:15.011
In the green ledger, yes.

01:24:15.011 --> 01:24:16.375
So if we can
get hold o’ that,

01:24:16.375 --> 01:24:18.080
we can prove that
they poisoned our chocolate.

01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.851
Scrubitt and Bleacher
would go to jail,

01:24:19.851 --> 01:24:20.885
and we’ll all be free.

01:24:20.885 --> 01:24:22.612
Uh, yes, but may I remind you,

01:24:22.612 --> 01:24:24.988
they keep that ledger
in a vault.

01:24:24.988 --> 01:24:26.484
Guarded by a corrupt cleric.

01:24:26.484 --> 01:24:28.519
And 500 chocoholic monks.

01:24:28.519 --> 01:24:31.027
-  Mm-hmm.
- That’s all true.

01:24:31.027 --> 01:24:33.590
But I went for a long,
cold swim this morning.

01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:35.229
Cold water is very good
for the brain.

01:24:35.229 --> 01:24:36.967
Stimulates
the neural pathways.

01:24:36.967 --> 01:24:39.464
And after just four miles,
it came to me.

01:24:39.464 --> 01:24:41.169
How an ingenious orphan,

01:24:41.169 --> 01:24:42.269
an accountant, a plumber,

01:24:42.269 --> 01:24:44.073
a telephone exchange operator,

01:24:44.073 --> 01:24:46.075
and a man
who can speak underwater,

01:24:46.075 --> 01:24:47.142
could combine those talents,

01:24:47.142 --> 01:24:48.605
and pull off
the heist of the century.

01:24:48.605 --> 01:24:51.410
But even if we do get
our hands on that ledger,

01:24:51.410 --> 01:24:54.919
the Cartel will simply bribe
their way out of trouble.

01:24:54.919 --> 01:24:56.888
It’s what they do.

01:24:56.888 --> 01:24:58.615
The greedy
beat the needy, Willy.

01:24:58.615 --> 01:25:00.958
It’s just the way
of the world.

01:25:00.958 --> 01:25:02.058
You’re right, Noodle.

01:25:02.058 --> 01:25:03.994
I guess that’s why
there’s one other thing to do.

01:25:03.994 --> 01:25:07.657
- What’s that?
-  Change the world.

01:25:10.396 --> 01:25:11.529
Whoa!

01:25:12.937 --> 01:25:14.136
Where do we start?

01:25:26.082 --> 01:25:27.380
’Scuse me, sir.

01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:30.449
Could you spare
a piece of chocolate
for a starvin’ orphan?

01:25:30.449 --> 01:25:34.959
I’m sorry, my child.
I don’t have any on me.

01:25:34.959 --> 01:25:36.994
Oh.

01:25:37.423 --> 01:25:40.393
Then have some acacia mints.

01:25:41.097 --> 01:25:42.494
Yes!

01:25:43.935 --> 01:25:47.103
"To Basil Bond,
employee of the week."

01:25:47.103 --> 01:25:48.599
Oh, that’s lovely...

01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:02.019
Everything all right
back there?

01:26:02.019 --> 01:26:05.319
Everything’s fine.
Isn’t it, Abigail?

01:26:06.485 --> 01:26:08.157
Tell her she might
want to duck.

01:26:08.157 --> 01:26:10.489
Tell her she might
wanna what?

01:26:10.489 --> 01:26:12.227
Duck!

01:26:15.065 --> 01:26:16.330
Good morning, brethren.

01:26:16.330 --> 01:26:17.661
Good morning, Father.

01:26:17.661 --> 01:26:19.168
Now, as you all know,

01:26:19.168 --> 01:26:22.402
it’s Baron von
Schmeichelhammer’s
funeral today.

01:26:22.402 --> 01:26:25.438
And his widow is...

01:26:25.438 --> 01:26:28.111
a bit of a pious type.
-  Ugh!

01:26:28.111 --> 01:26:29.640
So, I don’t want
to see anyone

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:32.214
eating chocolate
during the service.

01:26:32.214 --> 01:26:34.051
Yes, Father.

01:26:34.051 --> 01:26:35.151
We all know that one day,

01:26:35.151 --> 01:26:37.186
we shall be judged
for our sins,

01:26:37.186 --> 01:26:40.684
but it’s not going
to be today.

01:26:40.684 --> 01:26:43.324
Amen.

01:26:56.238 --> 01:26:58.273
There, there.

01:26:58.273 --> 01:26:59.406

You know what you’ve done,
Julius.

01:27:20.031 --> 01:27:22.495
You’ve sold your soul
for 30 pieces of chocolate.

01:27:26.235 --> 01:27:28.402
Hello, operator.
How may I direct your call?

01:27:28.402 --> 01:27:31.108
I need the Zoo.
It’s an emergency.

01:27:31.108 --> 01:27:35.211
Putting you through
to the Escaped
Animal Department now.

01:27:37.147 --> 01:27:38.181
Hello, Zoo.

01:27:41.415 --> 01:27:43.516
Quiet down, you animals.

01:27:43.516 --> 01:27:44.583
You too, octopus.

01:27:44.583 --> 01:27:47.223
There’s a giraffe.
- What? Oh, yeah, I think

01:27:47.223 --> 01:27:48.719
we did lose a giraffe.

01:27:48.719 --> 01:27:50.325
Well, could you come
and get it?

01:27:50.325 --> 01:27:53.823
Okay, jeez.
I’ll send the guys around.

01:28:05.406 --> 01:28:07.672
Oh, forgive me!

01:28:08.211 --> 01:28:09.278
I’m a sinner!

01:28:09.278 --> 01:28:14.415
A weak and wicked chocoholic!

01:28:22.786 --> 01:28:23.820
Good morning, everyone.

01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:26.790
Welcome
to St. Benedict’s.

01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:30.464
Baroness,
I’m so sorry for your loss.

01:28:30.464 --> 01:28:35.667
We’re just having a few
technical difficulties, um,

01:28:35.667 --> 01:28:36.602
so you might want to pop

01:28:36.602 --> 01:28:39.143
the late baron down
for a minute.

01:28:40.672 --> 01:28:41.475
Ah, the cavalry.

01:28:41.475 --> 01:28:45.347
Are you the cleric
who called about a giraffe?

01:28:50.715 --> 01:28:52.783
All clear.

01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:19.909
Huh. "Thanks
for all your hard work."

01:29:19.909 --> 01:29:23.847
"Father Julius
and the Chocolate Cartel."

01:29:23.847 --> 01:29:26.157
Oh, that’s nice.

01:29:26.487 --> 01:29:27.158
Mmm.

01:29:27.158 --> 01:29:28.753
Here we are, Father.

01:29:28.753 --> 01:29:30.293
- One giraffe.

01:29:30.293 --> 01:29:32.559
Marvelous.
Thank you, thank you.

01:29:32.559 --> 01:29:33.824
Stand back, please.
Stand back.

01:29:44.373 --> 01:29:45.737

I could’ve
been happy, but I threw
a pearl away.

01:29:47.838 --> 01:29:49.939
I’ll give him a call.
No, I can’t.

01:29:49.939 --> 01:29:52.678
I will give him a call
actually.

01:29:58.453 --> 01:29:59.289
Hello?

01:29:59.289 --> 01:30:01.621
Basil? It’s Gwennie.

01:30:01.621 --> 01:30:02.424
You were right.

01:30:02.424 --> 01:30:03.524
What are the chances?

01:30:03.524 --> 01:30:07.561
Those days in chemistry class
were the happiest of my life.

01:30:27.746 --> 01:30:29.319
Cool.

01:30:36.326 --> 01:30:37.393
Sorry about this, sir.

01:30:37.393 --> 01:30:38.724
The seafood truck
spilled its load.

01:30:38.724 --> 01:30:40.825
There’s so many blasted
flamingos about these days.

01:30:40.825 --> 01:30:42.794
Well,
hurry it along now, will you?

01:30:42.794 --> 01:30:45.302
The town square
was closed this morning

01:30:45.302 --> 01:30:48.239
after a bizarre incident
at the city cathedral.

01:30:48.239 --> 01:30:51.803
Delaying the funeral
of noted philanthropist,

01:30:51.803 --> 01:30:53.805
Baron von Schmeichelhammer.

01:30:53.805 --> 01:30:55.807
In nomine Patris,

01:30:55.807 --> 01:31:00.317
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

01:31:00.383 --> 01:31:01.681
Amen.

01:31:05.586 --> 01:31:08.589
Sorry, I’d best get that.

01:31:09.557 --> 01:31:11.526
- Hello, pulpit?
-  Father.

01:31:11.526 --> 01:31:12.659
Everything all right there?

01:31:12.659 --> 01:31:14.661
Oh, yes, Mr. Slugworth.

01:31:14.661 --> 01:31:16.531
All tickety-boo.

01:31:16.531 --> 01:31:17.466
At least, it is now.

01:31:17.466 --> 01:31:19.028
- What do you mean by that?

01:31:19.028 --> 01:31:20.733
Oh, we had a giraffe
in here earlier.

01:31:20.733 --> 01:31:22.867
Had to clear the whole place
for about 20 minutes,

01:31:22.867 --> 01:31:25.672
but everything’s
back to normal.

01:31:27.575 --> 01:31:28.279
Hello?

01:31:28.279 --> 01:31:30.941
Damn the flamingos,
Donovan! Floor it!

01:31:30.941 --> 01:31:32.415
Yes, sir!

01:31:35.451 --> 01:31:36.881
Idiot!

01:31:40.423 --> 01:31:42.359
Anything?
- Nothing.

01:31:42.359 --> 01:31:43.294
Well, keep looking.

01:31:43.294 --> 01:31:44.427
It’s not in here, Willy.

01:31:44.427 --> 01:31:45.791
But Abacus said
that it was here.

01:31:45.791 --> 01:31:48.332
Abacus has been
in the Wash House
for the past four years.

01:31:48.332 --> 01:31:49.861
Maybe all the scrubbing
has gone to his head.

01:31:49.861 --> 01:31:54.503
’Cause all that’s down here
is just a bunch
of stupid old chocolate.

01:32:09.452 --> 01:32:11.322
Willy, look!

01:32:18.659 --> 01:32:19.957
We did it, Noodle.

01:32:19.957 --> 01:32:22.399
- We got ’em.

01:32:23.367 --> 01:32:25.864
Naughty, naughty,
Mr. Wonka.

01:32:25.864 --> 01:32:29.406
You’ve caused us
quite a bit of trouble.

01:32:29.406 --> 01:32:30.836
You and your urchin.

01:32:30.836 --> 01:32:32.871
Yeah, but she’s not
just an urchin,

01:32:32.871 --> 01:32:34.477
is she, Mr. Slugworth?

01:32:35.907 --> 01:32:37.909
You’re family.

01:32:37.975 --> 01:32:38.844
What?

01:32:38.844 --> 01:32:41.649
What are you talking about,
Willy?

01:32:42.485 --> 01:32:44.454
You know that ring, Noodle?

01:32:44.454 --> 01:32:46.016
The one your parents gave you?

01:32:46.016 --> 01:32:48.689
Mr. Slugworth has one
just like it.

01:32:48.689 --> 01:32:50.988
Don’t you, Mr. Slugworth?

01:32:50.988 --> 01:32:53.496
As a matter of fact, I do.

01:32:53.496 --> 01:32:58.732
That belonged to my brother.
Zebedee.

01:32:58.732 --> 01:32:59.766
Was he my father?

01:32:59.766 --> 01:33:02.406
A hopeless romantic
is what he was.

01:33:02.406 --> 01:33:05.002
Fell in love with
a common little bookworm,

01:33:05.002 --> 01:33:06.905
died before
they could marry.

01:33:06.905 --> 01:33:11.943
Leaving me sole heir
to the family fortune.

01:33:12.416 --> 01:33:14.682
Or so I thought.

01:33:14.682 --> 01:33:16.013
But nine months later,

01:33:16.013 --> 01:33:17.949
your mother turned up
on my doorstep,

01:33:17.949 --> 01:33:22.921
begging me to get a doctor
for her sick little newborn.

01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:24.857
I said I would help.

01:33:24.857 --> 01:33:27.057
But you didn’t.
Did you?

01:33:27.057 --> 01:33:28.058
Oh, no.

01:33:28.058 --> 01:33:30.929
Instead, you put me
down a laundry chute.

01:33:30.929 --> 01:33:32.700
Bye-bye, baby.

01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:34.999
Mrs. Scrubitt found me.

01:33:34.999 --> 01:33:35.967
She saw the ring.

01:33:35.967 --> 01:33:39.773
Thought it was an "N,"
and called me Noodle.

01:33:39.938 --> 01:33:40.873
But it wasn’t.

01:33:40.873 --> 01:33:43.106
It was "Z." For Zebedee.

01:33:43.106 --> 01:33:44.107
Well, quite.

01:33:44.107 --> 01:33:46.978
When your mother returned,
I told her you had died.
-  Oh, no!

01:33:46.978 --> 01:33:48.716
She was
heartbroken, of course.

01:33:48.716 --> 01:33:50.520
But, uh, I gave her
a handful of sovereigns

01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:53.985
and had her escorted
from my property.

01:33:55.426 --> 01:33:57.593
What was her name?

01:33:57.692 --> 01:33:58.660
Eh?

01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:01.663
My mom. What was her name?

01:34:02.433 --> 01:34:03.665
Ooh.

01:34:03.665 --> 01:34:05.667
Let me see. Um...

01:34:05.832 --> 01:34:08.538
No, I don’t think
I could remember that.

01:34:08.538 --> 01:34:12.168
Sorry.
But you have to understand,

01:34:12.168 --> 01:34:13.609
she was very poor.

01:34:13.609 --> 01:34:16.007
- Sorry, Felix.

01:34:16.007 --> 01:34:17.910
Her name was Dorothy.

01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:21.012
Dorothy Smith.
It says so right here.

01:34:21.111 --> 01:34:22.178
Dorothy?

01:34:22.178 --> 01:34:23.685
Well, what do you know?

01:34:23.685 --> 01:34:26.688
I guess you did teach me
to read after all.

01:34:27.458 --> 01:34:29.185
Well,
this is all very touching,

01:34:29.185 --> 01:34:30.824
but back to business.

01:34:30.824 --> 01:34:31.990
We’ll take that, thank you.

01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:35.796
How much chocolate
do you have at your factory,
Mr. Fickelgruber?

01:34:35.796 --> 01:34:37.897
Oh, about 80,000 gallons.

01:34:37.897 --> 01:34:40.064
- Prodnose?

01:34:40.064 --> 01:34:40.999
Seventy-five?

01:34:40.999 --> 01:34:43.474
And I’ve got 150.

01:34:43.606 --> 01:34:45.476
That should be enough.

01:34:45.476 --> 01:34:46.939
For what?

01:34:47.038 --> 01:34:50.646
Death by chocolate.

01:35:08.158 --> 01:35:10.061
On you go.

01:35:28.079 --> 01:35:29.850
Uh, gentlemen.

01:35:30.279 --> 01:35:31.588
Considering the situation,

01:35:31.588 --> 01:35:34.822
I wondered if you’d do
a good deed on my behalf.

01:35:34.822 --> 01:35:35.790
A what?

01:35:35.790 --> 01:35:36.626
"A good deed."

01:35:36.626 --> 01:35:39.024
It’s a sort of pointless act
of selflessness...

01:35:39.024 --> 01:35:41.532
Yes, of course, Mr. Wonka.

01:35:41.532 --> 01:35:42.962
What would you like us to do?

01:35:42.962 --> 01:35:46.603
I was wondering if you could
give this to someone.

01:35:46.801 --> 01:35:48.836
Only if you happen to see him.

01:35:48.836 --> 01:35:49.672
And who is it?

01:35:49.672 --> 01:35:52.202
A little orange man.
- Eh?

01:35:52.202 --> 01:35:53.841
A little orange man.

01:35:53.841 --> 01:35:54.776
About eight inches high,

01:35:54.776 --> 01:35:56.206
with orange skin
and bright green hair.

01:35:56.206 --> 01:35:59.748
I owe him a jar of chocolates,
you see. And, well,

01:35:59.748 --> 01:36:03.015
I think these might be
the best I ever made.

01:36:03.015 --> 01:36:03.950
Well, in that case,

01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:07.118
I’ll make sure
he gets them personally.

01:36:11.221 --> 01:36:13.597
Farewell, Mr. Wonka.

01:36:14.565 --> 01:36:15.929
Urchin.

01:36:26.874 --> 01:36:30.075
-  Willy...

01:36:54.803 --> 01:36:56.299
What are we gonna do, Willy?

01:36:56.299 --> 01:37:00.336
I don’t know, Noodle.
I’ll think of something.

01:37:06.375 --> 01:37:08.685
Best chocolate
he ever made, eh?

01:37:10.984 --> 01:37:12.920
Whoo-hoo.
- Oh!

01:37:14.218 --> 01:37:15.120
I got it!

01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:17.056
What is it?
Did you think of something?

01:37:17.056 --> 01:37:17.991
Yes, I did.

01:37:17.991 --> 01:37:19.630
If we’re gonna drown
in chocolate, Noodle,

01:37:19.630 --> 01:37:22.094
and let’s face it, we’re gonna
drown in chocolate,

01:37:22.094 --> 01:37:23.392
then it’s gonna
be Wonka chocolate.

01:37:23.392 --> 01:37:26.835
We’re not gonna drown, Willy.
Look, there’s a light.

01:37:26.835 --> 01:37:29.101
We’ll let the chocolate
lift us up,

01:37:29.101 --> 01:37:30.300
we’ll bang on the glass,

01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:32.907
and pray somebody hears us.

01:37:32.907 --> 01:37:35.173
That’s a much better idea.

01:37:37.208 --> 01:37:38.044
Ah, gentlemen.

01:37:38.044 --> 01:37:40.277
It was a bit of a close shave
this morning,

01:37:40.277 --> 01:37:41.817
and I was wondering if perhaps

01:37:41.817 --> 01:37:45.689
we could rethink
our arrangement. Or...

01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:51.189
Or... just leave things
as they are.

01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:53.059
Father.

01:37:53.158 --> 01:37:55.292
Well, Wonka might be as nutty
as a fruitcake,

01:37:55.292 --> 01:37:56.964
but he sure knew
how to make chocolate.

01:37:56.964 --> 01:37:58.361
Mmm.
- But do you think

01:37:58.361 --> 01:38:01.034
we should have saved some
for the Little Orange Man?

01:38:01.034 --> 01:38:02.134
Tell me you’re joking.

01:38:02.134 --> 01:38:05.335
Uh, yes. Yes, I am.
Sorry, why am I?

01:38:05.335 --> 01:38:07.073
Because
there’s no such thing

01:38:07.073 --> 01:38:10.406
as a little orange man,
ya nincompoop.

01:38:12.683 --> 01:38:14.685
Help!
Help!

01:38:14.685 --> 01:38:16.181
Somebody help, please!

01:38:16.181 --> 01:38:17.952
Please help!
- Help!

01:38:17.952 --> 01:38:20.823
Look. Look,
somebody’s coming. Look.

01:38:20.823 --> 01:38:23.155
Willy, we’re saved!

01:38:35.266 --> 01:38:38.808
I’m sorry, Noodle.
- Don’t be.

01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:41.173
You found my family.

01:38:41.173 --> 01:38:43.978
A mom who loved me.

01:38:43.978 --> 01:38:46.783
That’s all I ever wanted.

01:38:48.048 --> 01:38:49.951
Deep breath now.

01:39:03.195 --> 01:39:06.770
Mmm! Exquisite.

01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:09.465
You mustn’t let yourself
get so worked up.

01:39:09.465 --> 01:39:11.434
It’s just a bit of chocolate.

01:39:11.434 --> 01:39:13.403
-  Correction.

01:39:13.403 --> 01:39:17.748
It was actually my chocolate.

01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:27.252
You have made
a very grave error, gentlemen.

01:39:27.252 --> 01:39:29.485
You steal from
an Oompa Loompa,

01:39:29.485 --> 01:39:30.794
we take back

01:39:30.794 --> 01:39:32.521
a thousandfold.

01:39:39.869 --> 01:39:41.970
What’s going on, Willy?

01:39:42.069 --> 01:39:44.137
It’s draining, Noodle.

01:39:44.137 --> 01:39:46.007
We’ve been saved!

01:39:46.007 --> 01:39:49.043
- By who?
- I don’t know.

01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:51.782
By the Little Orange Man!

01:39:51.782 --> 01:39:52.508
- Look.
- Wh...

01:39:52.508 --> 01:39:54.279
The Little Orange Man!

01:39:54.279 --> 01:39:57.084
Thank you,
Little Orange Man! Thank you!

01:40:20.206 --> 01:40:23.110
Gentlemen.
Thank goodness you’re okay.

01:40:23.110 --> 01:40:25.376
I came as fast as I could.

01:40:33.384 --> 01:40:35.122
Whew! Car shrunk.

01:40:35.122 --> 01:40:36.189
I’m sure it did.

01:40:36.189 --> 01:40:38.257
And you’ve nothing
to worry about, Chief.

01:40:38.257 --> 01:40:39.192
All under control.

01:40:39.192 --> 01:40:40.589
A couple of thieves broke in,
but I’m afraid

01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:44.098
they met with a little...
accident.

01:40:44.098 --> 01:40:47.002
In which they died.

01:40:47.937 --> 01:40:49.466
That’s actually
rather good, Gerald.

01:40:49.466 --> 01:40:51.105
I wouldn’t be
so sure about that.

01:40:51.105 --> 01:40:53.976
Officer, would you kindly
take a look at this?

01:40:53.976 --> 01:40:54.471
Wonka!

01:40:54.471 --> 01:40:56.209
It details
every single illegal payment

01:40:56.209 --> 01:40:58.112
these men have ever made.

01:40:58.112 --> 01:40:59.014
Thousands of them.

01:40:59.014 --> 01:41:01.544
Affable, don’t listen
to her. She’s lyin’.

01:41:01.544 --> 01:41:03.887
Well, of course she is.

01:41:03.887 --> 01:41:05.350
She’s not, sir.

01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:07.517
She’s absolutely right.

01:41:07.583 --> 01:41:09.321
It’s incredible.

01:41:09.486 --> 01:41:10.553
Oh. Well.

01:41:10.553 --> 01:41:12.357
Then that sounds like a case

01:41:12.357 --> 01:41:13.589
for the Chief of Police.

01:41:13.589 --> 01:41:16.900
So you give it to me, Affable,
I’ll, uh...
I’ll take it off your hands.

01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:18.297
You know,
save you the paperwork.

01:41:18.297 --> 01:41:20.233
I can’t do that,
I’m afraid, sir.

01:41:20.233 --> 01:41:21.201
Why’s that?

01:41:21.201 --> 01:41:24.006
Because your name
is written down here.

01:41:24.006 --> 01:41:24.501
Huh?

01:41:24.501 --> 01:41:26.008
- A lot.
- Gentlemen...

01:41:26.008 --> 01:41:27.878
-  You’re under arrest.
-  Run.

01:41:27.878 --> 01:41:29.242
We puttin’
handcuffs on, here?

01:41:29.242 --> 01:41:30.474
- That’s okay, Noodle.

01:41:30.474 --> 01:41:32.146
Give it one second.

01:41:34.181 --> 01:41:36.150
What’s happening?

01:41:36.150 --> 01:41:37.085
Why are we airborne?

01:41:37.085 --> 01:41:38.581
You didn’t eat
any of those chocolates,

01:41:38.581 --> 01:41:40.550
did you, Mr. Slugworth?
- Why?

01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:42.057
Because
they’re Hoverchocs.

01:41:42.057 --> 01:41:44.290
Delayed action,
but extra strong.

01:41:44.290 --> 01:41:46.226
You think you’re
very clever, don’t you, Wonka?

01:41:46.226 --> 01:41:50.164
Well, there’s a billion
sovereigns of chocolate
beneath our feet.

01:41:50.164 --> 01:41:51.231
We’ll get the best lawyers,

01:41:51.231 --> 01:41:54.201
bribe the judge,
rig the jury if we have to.

01:41:54.201 --> 01:41:56.236
We’ll be fine.

01:41:56.236 --> 01:41:58.909
I wish I’d thought of that.

01:42:01.571 --> 01:42:03.276
Hey, Noodle!

01:42:21.129 --> 01:42:22.064
What is that?

01:42:22.064 --> 01:42:23.428
It’s our chocolate!

01:42:23.428 --> 01:42:25.430
All our chocolate!

01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:26.365
We’re ruined!

01:42:26.365 --> 01:42:27.971
Hey, don’t worry, gentlemen.

01:42:27.971 --> 01:42:30.468
You’ll come down eventually.

01:42:30.468 --> 01:42:33.570
Probably. I think.

01:42:33.570 --> 01:42:35.605
But until then,

01:42:35.704 --> 01:42:38.179
ladies and gentlemen,

01:42:38.179 --> 01:42:41.952
Willy Wonka and friends...

01:42:41.952 --> 01:42:45.252
...invite you
to enjoy our chocolate.

01:42:45.252 --> 01:42:48.717
Yay! Magic Wonka!

01:42:51.621 --> 01:42:53.161
Gwennie?

01:42:53.161 --> 01:42:55.427
Basil!

01:42:55.625 --> 01:42:56.967
What did I say, Abacus,

01:42:56.967 --> 01:42:59.398
I told you
we could fix it all.

01:43:16.745 --> 01:43:18.516
Your cup.

01:43:18.681 --> 01:43:19.550
Thank you.

01:43:19.550 --> 01:43:21.057
- There you are.
-  There you go.

01:43:21.057 --> 01:43:22.322
Careful, not too much.

01:43:22.322 --> 01:43:23.686
Okay.

01:45:00.849 --> 01:45:04.655
Mmm.
- Oh, thank you.

01:45:04.655 --> 01:45:05.755
Thank you.

01:45:05.755 --> 01:45:08.296
Mmm.
Thank you.

01:45:08.296 --> 01:45:10.826
Mmm.
-  Oh.

01:45:19.538 --> 01:45:21.177
Huh.

01:45:23.773 --> 01:45:28.217
So...
how does it feel, Willy?

01:45:28.283 --> 01:45:30.714
Is it as good as you remember?

01:45:31.517 --> 01:45:33.321
Every little bit.

01:45:36.456 --> 01:45:38.854
I wish it could last forever.

01:45:44.596 --> 01:45:46.598
I guess it’s time.

01:45:48.138 --> 01:45:48.765
Time for what?

01:45:48.765 --> 01:45:53.209
Do you know
how many people in this city
are named D. Smith?

01:45:53.275 --> 01:45:54.210
106.

01:45:54.210 --> 01:45:57.345
And luckily, you have
a friend who works
at the telephone exchange.

01:45:57.345 --> 01:45:59.875
And she spent
the entire afternoon

01:45:59.875 --> 01:46:01.481
ringing around.

01:46:01.481 --> 01:46:03.450
And guess what?

01:46:04.385 --> 01:46:06.189
We found her.

01:46:06.486 --> 01:46:07.718
You found my mom?

01:46:07.718 --> 01:46:10.523
She works
in the library.

01:46:11.326 --> 01:46:13.427
That’s where she lives.

01:46:14.692 --> 01:46:16.595

So goes a good deed

01:47:58.598 --> 01:47:59.698
in a weary world.

01:47:59.698 --> 01:48:01.766
I was wondering
if I’d see you again.

01:48:01.766 --> 01:48:03.867
I’m not going anywhere,
Willy Wonka.

01:48:03.867 --> 01:48:05.803
Not until you’ve
paid your debt.

01:48:05.803 --> 01:48:07.277
Now, I know you tried.

01:48:07.277 --> 01:48:10.313
Loompa law is very clear
on this subject.

01:48:10.313 --> 01:48:10.907
Until such time

01:48:10.907 --> 01:48:14.680
as the chocolate is physically
in my hand...

01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:17.419
Oh. Thank you.

01:48:17.419 --> 01:48:20.422
Thank you. For saving my life.

01:48:21.016 --> 01:48:22.985
Well, I suppose
that concludes our business.

01:48:22.985 --> 01:48:25.856
I will now return
to my beloved Loompaland.

01:48:25.856 --> 01:48:30.729
Where the cocoa beans grow in
disappointingly small numbers,

01:48:30.729 --> 01:48:32.434
and my friends
look down on me.

01:48:32.434 --> 01:48:34.667
What? I thought
they called you Lofty.

01:48:34.667 --> 01:48:37.901
The truth is that
I am a quarter-inch

01:48:37.901 --> 01:48:39.936
below average.

01:48:39.936 --> 01:48:41.476
They call me Shorty-pants.

01:48:41.476 --> 01:48:43.709
- But there it is.

01:48:43.709 --> 01:48:44.941
Good day to you, sir.

01:48:44.941 --> 01:48:47.614
Uh, it’s a shame
you have to go.

01:48:47.845 --> 01:48:48.648
I said good day.

01:48:48.648 --> 01:48:50.683
If I’m gonna share
my chocolate with the world,

01:48:50.683 --> 01:48:52.421
I’m gonna need
more than a shop.

01:48:52.421 --> 01:48:53.389
I’m sure you will.

01:48:53.389 --> 01:48:54.423
I’m gonna need a factory.

01:48:54.423 --> 01:48:55.919
Yeah, well,
good luck with that.

01:48:55.919 --> 01:48:58.922
And someone to head up
