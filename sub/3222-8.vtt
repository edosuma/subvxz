WEBVTT

00:03.586 --> 00:05.748
You can't look me in the face
and tell me you're fine.

00:05.923 --> 00:08.084
You're not sleeping,
you drink for the record.

00:08.258 --> 00:11.091
How are those the actions of someone
who knows they did the right thing?

00:11.261 --> 00:12.853
You lied. You killed my friend.

00:13.030 --> 00:16.090
Killing Amy was not wrong.
You couldn't do it, so I did.

00:16.265 --> 00:18.097
I can't even be around you right now.

00:18.902 --> 00:21.336
- Might as well work with me.
- Don't know if I can.

00:21.505 --> 00:23.439
Let's try and stop the killings.

00:23.607 --> 00:24.699
That's your stuff.

00:24.908 --> 00:26.603
Yeah. I figured we'd take one car.

00:26.777 --> 00:29.211
Look, you know what?
You were right about Amy.

00:29.413 --> 00:32.940
I get why you did it. You were trying
to make sure no one else got hurt.

00:34.351 --> 00:36.478
<i>- Supernatural.
- This is a book?</i>

00:36.653 --> 00:39.850
Books. It was a series.
Didn't sell a lot of copies, though.

00:40.023 --> 00:42.514
Chuck, I am your number one fan.

00:42.693 --> 00:44.718
<i>But I know
Supernatural is just a book.</i>

00:44.928 --> 00:46.896
<i>- Becky, it's all real.
- Ha, ha. I knew it.</i>

00:47.064 --> 00:49.362
- You okay, lady?
- Is it really you?

00:51.535 --> 00:53.662
- Can you quit touching me?
- No.

00:53.837 --> 00:55.429
Um...

01:00.043 --> 01:02.204
Whoo! Yeah!

01:02.846 --> 01:06.441
Okay, you won't believe it.
People think I say it to get a bigger tip.

01:06.617 --> 01:08.710
- Try me.
- Fine.

01:08.886 --> 01:11.047
I'm in grad school.

01:11.355 --> 01:14.916
See? Okay, there's a look.
Okay, ha, ha, stop.

01:15.092 --> 01:17.754
- No, this is my I-dig-smart-chicks look.
- Oh.

01:17.928 --> 01:21.557
No, if they, uh, wore that,
I wouldn't have dropped out of school.

01:23.700 --> 01:26.533
- So, what's your deal?
- My deal?

01:26.703 --> 01:29.763
Yeah. You came in here
looking like somebody shot your puppy.

01:32.442 --> 01:35.502
Well, things are looking up
now that your shift's over.

01:36.914 --> 01:38.643
All right.

01:38.816 --> 01:41.512
Uh, here's the deal. I have this friend.

01:42.219 --> 01:45.245
He's got this younger brother, right?
Cannon's a little loose.

01:45.422 --> 01:48.585
You know, his reactor blew
a while back. It's not good. Uh...

01:49.593 --> 01:54.155
My friend, uh, he's kind of been sitting,
waiting to see if he goes guano again.

01:54.331 --> 01:58.324
- And I assume it just hit the fan.
- Well, that's the thing, it didn't.

01:58.502 --> 01:59.992
The kid's all reasonable now.

02:00.170 --> 02:01.501
Considering he's crazy.

02:01.672 --> 02:04.470
Well, he's...
I mean, he's not crazy. He...

02:05.142 --> 02:07.940
It's starting to seem
like things might be getting better.

02:08.110 --> 02:10.670
- Well, that's a good thing, right?
- It's a miracle.

02:10.848 --> 02:13.180
Except what happens...

02:13.350 --> 02:17.286
...during their sacred annual pilgrimage
to Vegas...

02:17.454 --> 02:20.480
...and he goes off
on some granola-munching hike...

02:20.657 --> 02:22.625
...in the desert by himself.

02:22.826 --> 02:25.818
Well, maybe he just needs
some time alone.

02:26.463 --> 02:29.193
- Yeah.
- We all need to face ourselves sometime.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.167
Maybe he does.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.495
Wasn't talking about him.

02:38.175 --> 02:39.665
Excuse me.

02:41.311 --> 02:45.008
Speak of the devil.
He's four blocks away?

02:46.316 --> 02:49.979
See? Baby bro needs you after all.

03:29.927 --> 03:31.053
Dean.

03:31.695 --> 03:33.663
It's okay, you won't need that.
Come on.

03:34.197 --> 03:37.394
I thought you were off becoming one
with the land or some crap.

03:37.567 --> 03:40.035
No, you gotta... Come here. All right.

03:40.203 --> 03:41.898
Yeah.

03:43.674 --> 03:45.107
Hi.

03:45.275 --> 03:46.367
What is this?

03:46.543 --> 03:49.137
Apparently, uh, pink is for loyalty.

03:49.313 --> 03:51.941
What's the pretext?
What are we, wedding crashers, huh?

03:52.582 --> 03:55.551
- We looking for some siren or what?
- No. Nothing like that.

03:55.719 --> 03:57.243
All right, um.

03:57.688 --> 03:59.986
So a little sudden, but life is short...

04:00.190 --> 04:02.124
...so I'll keep this shorter.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.052
I'm in love...

04:04.928 --> 04:06.828
...and I'm getting married.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.696
Say something.
Like congratulations, for example.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.272
What?

04:20.476 --> 04:21.910
What the hell?

04:39.229 --> 04:41.424
- Becky?
- Dean.

04:41.598 --> 04:43.725
I'm so glad you're here.

05:05.555 --> 05:08.820
Shouldn't she ask for my permission
or something?

05:10.193 --> 05:11.660
You want her to ask for my hand?

05:12.462 --> 05:14.054
How in the...?

05:15.499 --> 05:17.364
- How did this happen?
- Short version?

05:17.534 --> 05:20.469
We met, we ate...

05:20.637 --> 05:22.798
...and then talked and fell in love.

05:22.973 --> 05:25.237
And, you know, here we are.

05:25.409 --> 05:27.240
Yeah. I guess I'm all caught up.

05:27.411 --> 05:29.174
That's... Okay, you know what?

05:29.346 --> 05:32.213
Ignoring everything...

05:32.382 --> 05:34.873
...have you forgotten
the life span of your hookups?

05:35.052 --> 05:38.579
- Yeah. But...
- But if anyone knows that, it's me.

05:38.789 --> 05:41.758
I mean, I read every book.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.325
So open eyes, you know?

05:45.228 --> 05:46.320
Open eyes.

05:46.496 --> 05:47.861
I'm gonna be sick.

05:48.031 --> 05:51.762
Dean, it's simple. If something good's
happening, I gottajump on it now.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.028
Today. Period.

05:54.204 --> 05:55.728
<i>Okay, Dead Poets Society. Fine.</i>

05:56.606 --> 05:59.006
No offense,
did you make sure she's even really...?

05:59.176 --> 06:02.339
Salt, holy water, everything.

06:02.512 --> 06:03.570
See?

06:04.081 --> 06:06.948
Not a monster.
Just the right girl for your brother.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.381
- Ah.
- That's it.

06:09.553 --> 06:11.077
- The bill.
- I got it.

06:12.889 --> 06:14.618
You two do your brother thing.

06:18.328 --> 06:20.023
Do you take traveler's checks?

06:20.197 --> 06:22.392
Really? Superfan 99?

06:22.566 --> 06:26.730
Dean, look, heh, honest to God, I had the
exact same opinion of her as you do...

06:26.903 --> 06:29.394
...but when we got past
the whole book thing...

06:29.573 --> 06:32.041
...I found out that she's great
and I was the dick.

06:32.209 --> 06:34.439
Yeah,
speaking of the whole, uh, book thing...

06:34.611 --> 06:37.409
...Becky randomly shows up
during Vegas week?

06:37.581 --> 06:39.549
- Yeah, ha, ha.
- Yeah.

06:41.785 --> 06:43.116
Um, what are you trying to say?

06:43.286 --> 06:45.311
I'm saying she knew
you were gonna be here.

06:45.489 --> 06:48.481
Maybe, uh, uh,
Chuck wrote about it.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.489
- You're paranoid.
- And you're in love?

06:50.660 --> 06:52.252
It's been four days, man.

06:52.429 --> 06:54.795
You know what?
Dean, you know what, um?

06:54.965 --> 06:58.457
How about this? Becky and I are
gonna go up to her place in Delaware.

06:58.635 --> 07:01.729
Um, try and wrap your dome around
this, get a little supportive...

07:01.905 --> 07:03.463
...then give us a call.

07:04.174 --> 07:07.234
First official tweet...

07:07.410 --> 07:13.906
...as Mrs. Becky Rosen-Winchester.

07:20.991 --> 07:25.360
Bobby. Hey, I know you're, uh,
beard-deep in that Oregon nest.

07:25.529 --> 07:28.498
I'm headed to Delaware
to do a little snooping around.

07:28.665 --> 07:30.792
Sam is there with his wife.

07:30.967 --> 07:33.333
That's right, you heard me. His wife.

07:33.503 --> 07:35.164
Call me.

07:43.046 --> 07:46.447
- I thought we just ate.
- Quick stop.

07:46.616 --> 07:48.208
Well, is that my fault?

07:48.418 --> 07:50.613
I told you we had tickets 11 times.

07:50.787 --> 07:51.845
Hi, Jocelyn.

07:52.022 --> 07:53.114
Let me call you back.

07:53.290 --> 07:55.656
Just get a sitter, it's not calculus.

07:56.526 --> 07:58.187
Yes, can I help you?

07:58.361 --> 08:00.886
It's Becky. Becky Rosen.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.292
Oh.

08:02.799 --> 08:05.290
- Yechie Becky.
- Ha.

08:05.468 --> 08:07.368
- Long time ago.
- Yechie Becky.

08:10.674 --> 08:12.301
Well, you look just the same.

08:12.475 --> 08:15.808
I'm here to RSVP for the reunion.
If it's not too late.

08:15.979 --> 08:20.143
No.
No, there is always room for one more.

08:20.884 --> 08:24.581
Actually, it's Rosen-Winchester.

08:26.456 --> 08:28.321
So mark me down plus one.

08:35.030 --> 08:39.058
Jocelyn Caruso, roasted.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.767
- Hi, Guy.
- You're back.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.839
- How was Vegas?
- It was awesome.

08:49.012 --> 08:50.570
Really? Really? Ha, ha.

08:51.181 --> 08:54.878
- Guy, meet my husband, Sam.
- Hey.

08:58.555 --> 09:01.046
- It's an honor to meet you, Sam.
- Thanks. You too.

09:01.591 --> 09:04.458
Guy is a good friend.
We met in the Erotic Horror section...

09:04.628 --> 09:06.721
...at the Novel Hovel.
Oh, Becky, come on.

09:06.896 --> 09:08.887
TMI.

09:09.199 --> 09:12.259
- The poor guy's just met me.
- No, it's okay. Nice to meet you.

09:12.435 --> 09:14.403
Any friend of Becky's...

09:15.905 --> 09:19.773
Anyway, I should, uh, get back to it
or this party's not gonna happen, right?

09:19.943 --> 09:21.376
Sure.

09:22.212 --> 09:25.545
Guy is an event planner.
Reunion season is very busy for him.

09:25.715 --> 09:26.773
Hold on one sec.

09:30.020 --> 09:31.146
One more thing.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.050
- You get my message?
- Of course.

09:33.223 --> 09:34.918
I thought you'd never ask.

09:35.091 --> 09:36.956
Give me a hug.

09:40.630 --> 09:43.121
I swear, if everyone had a Wiccan
in their pocket...

09:43.300 --> 09:46.269
...the world would be a happier place.
It is nothing.

09:46.436 --> 09:48.563
Blessed be, sweetie.

10:39.522 --> 10:42.184
Wow. You look nice.

10:43.293 --> 10:44.385
Thanks.

10:44.594 --> 10:49.156
I was, you know, saving it.

10:55.505 --> 10:56.733
To us.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.806
To us.

11:04.614 --> 11:07.481
Sam? Are you okay?

11:07.684 --> 11:09.379
Sammy, honey. What's wrong?

11:15.692 --> 11:18.183
Becky? Why am l...?

11:18.728 --> 11:20.696
What am I doing here?

11:39.182 --> 11:41.241
We're celebrating, dear.

11:41.751 --> 11:43.514
Remember?

11:44.687 --> 11:48.020
Uh... Yeah. Yeah, of course.

11:48.691 --> 11:50.283
To us.

11:53.663 --> 11:54.857
Feeling better, honey?

11:57.934 --> 11:59.094
Now that I'm with you.

12:59.496 --> 13:01.794
Me being supportive.

13:01.998 --> 13:04.831
Congratulations to you and the missus.

13:05.768 --> 13:06.826
Thanks.

13:07.003 --> 13:08.527
It's a waffle iron.

13:08.738 --> 13:11.298
Nonstick. You just, uh:

13:11.474 --> 13:13.339
I don't know how to use it.
Are we good?

13:14.344 --> 13:17.177
Good, because I'm sniffing a case
in this town.

13:18.181 --> 13:22.140
Score is guy wins Powerball,
gets squished by a truck.

13:22.318 --> 13:25.685
Second guy went from the bench
to the majors.

13:25.855 --> 13:30.189
Oh, and one week later,
his face was the catcher's mitt, huh?

13:30.360 --> 13:32.521
Our first thought
was Crossroads demons...

13:32.695 --> 13:36.131
...but there's that 10-year time frame
on collecting souls.

13:36.299 --> 13:37.630
Then there's cursed object.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.700
<i>Like in Bad Day at Black Rock.</i>

13:39.869 --> 13:42.337
But we haven't been able
to connect the vics yet.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.802
You're working this case together?

13:44.974 --> 13:46.874
Yeah. Ha, ha, I know, right?

13:47.377 --> 13:50.403
I mean, I guess
all those Chuck Shurley books paid off.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.980
I don't know what kind of mojo
you're working...

13:53.149 --> 13:57.176
...but believe me, I will find out.
Dean, that's my wife you're talking to.

13:57.353 --> 13:59.753
- You're not acting like yourself.
- How am I not?

13:59.923 --> 14:02.153
You married Becky Rosen.

14:02.892 --> 14:05.087
What are you saying? I'm a witch?

14:05.295 --> 14:07.024
Or maybe I'm a siren?

14:07.530 --> 14:11.022
Ever occur to you we're just,
I don't know, happy?

14:13.036 --> 14:14.901
Come on, Sam.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.163
Guy wins the lotto...

14:16.339 --> 14:17.863
...guy hits the bigs.

14:18.041 --> 14:21.272
All right, obviously, people's dreams
are coming true in this town.

14:21.444 --> 14:24.072
- You think this is a bit of a coincidence?
- You know what, Dean?

14:25.448 --> 14:27.177
What Becky and I have is real.

14:27.350 --> 14:30.444
And if you can't accept that,
that's your problem, not ours.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.349
Or maybe she's part of it.

14:32.522 --> 14:35.457
Because for whatever reason,
you're her dream.

14:36.025 --> 14:38.550
If you really do care about her,
I'd be worried.

14:39.329 --> 14:42.423
Because people who do get
their little fantasies or whatever...

14:42.599 --> 14:45.124
...seem to end up dead pretty quick.

14:45.335 --> 14:48.736
You know, I went after her, Dean.
Maybe that's what's bugging you.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.630
That I'm moving on with my life.

14:52.241 --> 14:54.971
I mean, you took care of me,
and that's great...

14:56.045 --> 14:58.206
...but I don't need you anymore.

15:09.726 --> 15:13.059
I don't want another hunter,
Bobby. Why can't you do it?

15:16.432 --> 15:17.922
Fine.

15:18.101 --> 15:19.261
What's his name?

15:29.779 --> 15:33.146
Hey. Uh...

15:45.161 --> 15:46.287
I got you a present.

15:50.133 --> 15:53.296
His and hers fake IDs? Ha, ha.

15:54.137 --> 15:56.196
Here. Check this out.

15:57.807 --> 16:03.143
"Junior salesman leapfrogs to CEO
at Mutual Freedom Insurance."

16:03.346 --> 16:05.541
You think the CEO is a lead?

16:05.715 --> 16:08.149
Uh, Becky.

16:15.525 --> 16:16.992
This is...

16:20.363 --> 16:22.194
...beautiful.

16:27.637 --> 16:29.969
So, what do you think about the CEO?

16:30.740 --> 16:33.573
Let's go pretext him.

16:53.730 --> 16:56.028
Hey. You Dean?

17:01.070 --> 17:02.560
I thought you'd be taller.

17:06.509 --> 17:08.875
I assume Bobby filled you in
on the road.

17:09.045 --> 17:10.272
He told me two things.

17:10.480 --> 17:13.711
One, he's tangling with a major-league
nest up in Oregon territory.

17:13.883 --> 17:18.843
<i>Numero dos, he said you'd be all surly
and premenstrual working with me.</i>

17:19.989 --> 17:23.015
But, hey, man, sticks and stones.

17:24.993 --> 17:26.689
I think I found a case.

17:26.863 --> 17:28.090
Check the headline.

17:28.263 --> 17:30.255
First things first.

17:42.912 --> 17:45.437
Oh, Marmaduke, you crazy.

17:49.252 --> 17:51.652
Are you trying to humiliate me?

17:51.821 --> 17:56.952
It's Marsha with an S-H-A,
not a C-l-A.

17:58.895 --> 18:00.624
Thanks again.

18:01.798 --> 18:03.959
- Hey, is that your...?
- Yes.

18:04.133 --> 18:05.828
Awkward.

18:08.604 --> 18:10.265
Hi.

18:10.439 --> 18:11.736
Okay.

18:12.675 --> 18:16.668
- So?
- So, uh, no point going in, guy's clean.

18:17.280 --> 18:18.508
- You sure?
- Yeah. Positive.

18:18.681 --> 18:21.582
Becky grilled him like a pro.
She's a real natural.

18:21.751 --> 18:22.911
Oh.

18:23.085 --> 18:24.643
What's with the scrawny guy?

18:26.856 --> 18:28.346
Temp.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.168
Throw a rock,
hit a reporter these days, eh?

18:39.335 --> 18:44.602
<i>Ha, ha. Well, your story's a big deal
over at the Actuarial Insider.</i>

18:44.774 --> 18:46.799
- Go ahead, shoot.
- All right.

18:46.976 --> 18:51.276
- Uh, how'd you get the gig?
- Board came to me, asked, said yes.

18:51.814 --> 18:54.282
- Just out of the blue?
- Pretty much.

18:55.651 --> 18:57.448
And any idea
how the board landed on you...

18:57.620 --> 18:59.850
...over your supervisors?

19:00.022 --> 19:02.513
Um, they didn't say.

19:02.692 --> 19:06.685
Tell us what specifically excited the
board about your actual qualifications.

19:07.296 --> 19:09.389
Say, fellas,
what's with the third degree?

19:09.599 --> 19:10.793
Oh, uh, no offense.

19:10.967 --> 19:13.561
We were just wondering if you got here
by nefarious means.

19:13.736 --> 19:14.862
Whoa, Garth.

19:16.372 --> 19:18.897
Oh. Heh, uh...

19:19.108 --> 19:22.669
I didn't mean, of course,
uh, corporate backstabbing. I'm sorry.

19:22.845 --> 19:25.336
I meant more like, uh, you know...

19:25.514 --> 19:27.004
...black magic or hoodoo.

19:29.986 --> 19:32.352
He jokes. He's, uh, ajokester.

19:32.521 --> 19:33.579
Let's, uh, rewind.

19:33.756 --> 19:38.489
Why don't, uh, you tell us what it felt
like when your big dream came true?

19:41.030 --> 19:44.227
Look, on the record, it's great.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.766
- Off the record?
- It's not my big dream.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.871
- Wait, you didn't want this job?
- Hell, no.

19:50.039 --> 19:52.405
I'm a Sales guy. I was good in Sales.

19:53.576 --> 19:56.943
Your secretary's an idiot.
I'll be at the printers this afternoon.

19:57.146 --> 19:58.943
All right, dear. See you at dinner.

19:59.148 --> 20:01.116
Just have the idiot
make a reservation.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.878
Here's a tip:
Remind her she works for the CEO.

20:04.053 --> 20:06.783
One more screwup, she's fired.

20:08.557 --> 20:11.720
Your, uh, wife seems pretty stoked
on the promotion, don't she?

20:12.395 --> 20:14.886
Honestly, I've never seen her happier.

20:15.097 --> 20:17.725
I have no idea how I'm gonna tell her
I have to resign.

20:17.900 --> 20:19.424
- The news is gonna...
- Kill her?

20:25.975 --> 20:28.068
- Mrs. Burrows. Hi.
- Can I help you?

20:28.244 --> 20:31.270
Yes. We're, uh, doing a story
on your husband's promotion.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.711
- Wanted to ask a few questions.
- I can't today.

20:33.883 --> 20:37.080
- If you schedule it with his girl...
- I'm trying to save you...

20:37.253 --> 20:39.153
...from a really bad accident.

20:39.322 --> 20:41.222
Are you threatening me?

20:41.390 --> 20:45.156
No. No, I'm pointing out a pattern.
Why do people keep thinking...

20:45.328 --> 20:49.287
...I'm threatening them?
Because it sounded like a threat, dude.

20:49.465 --> 20:51.956
Look, for your own good,
what did you do to get him promoted?

20:53.436 --> 20:55.404
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

20:55.571 --> 20:56.765
Now leave me alone...

20:56.939 --> 20:59.237
...or do I need to call Security?

21:03.713 --> 21:05.772
No, no, no.
Something's not adding up.

21:06.582 --> 21:09.107
I'm sure we'll get a break.

21:09.285 --> 21:11.776
Soon as we're done working...

21:11.954 --> 21:15.617
...romantic honeymoon getaway.

21:29.505 --> 21:31.370
Bring the damn car around.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.441
I'm not walking five blocks
in my heels.

21:46.856 --> 21:48.118
You okay?

21:49.759 --> 21:51.488
How did you know?

21:51.660 --> 21:54.254
Because you're not the first. Come on.

21:56.065 --> 21:58.465
You wanna tell us what's up here?

21:59.668 --> 22:01.898
I was having lunch with friends...

22:02.071 --> 22:04.665
...this guy heard me bitching,
next thing I know...

22:04.840 --> 22:07.308
...he's making me an offer.
An offer?

22:07.476 --> 22:09.137
Craig's job for my soul.

22:10.713 --> 22:13.409
I know, hilarious.
I mean, what have I got to lose?

22:13.582 --> 22:15.072
Well, there's your soul.

22:15.284 --> 22:17.775
What kind of demon deal is this?
Time line's whack.

22:19.055 --> 22:21.023
- What? Demon?
- Let me back up here.

22:21.524 --> 22:24.823
You made a deal with a demon
in exchange for your everlasting.

22:24.994 --> 22:28.657
Except those are 10-year contracts.
Why is the bill coming due so fast?

22:28.831 --> 22:32.164
I don't know, but I got a feeling about
who's next. We gotta find Sam.

22:32.334 --> 22:35.895
All right, all right. Here's the plan.
I drop this lady at my cousin's.

22:36.072 --> 22:39.007
He'll stop anything trying to get her.
We, uh, find Sam...

22:39.175 --> 22:42.872
<i>...hopefully fix this, everybody's home
in time for America's Got Talent.</i>

22:43.045 --> 22:46.173
Now, you. You'll be living
with a triracial paraplegic sniper...

22:46.348 --> 22:48.441
...until this all blows over, okay?

22:49.852 --> 22:51.183
<i>Guy, where are you?</i>

22:51.353 --> 22:52.752
We need to meet up fast.

22:52.922 --> 22:54.947
I'm losing Sam.

22:55.191 --> 22:57.853
Becky, what's happening?

22:58.527 --> 23:00.051
Don't you remember?

23:00.229 --> 23:01.423
We're married.

23:02.231 --> 23:04.131
Oh, Go...

23:04.333 --> 23:06.198
I'm calling Dean.

23:27.356 --> 23:29.256
Sam, do you feel concussion-y?

23:29.792 --> 23:32.920
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Where am I? What is going on?

23:33.095 --> 23:35.086
Sam, just calm down.

23:35.264 --> 23:37.732
Calm down? You hog-tied me to...

23:38.968 --> 23:41.129
Becky,
why am I not wearing any pants?

23:41.303 --> 23:43.328
- They're very constricting.
- Oh...

23:43.506 --> 23:45.906
Don't worry,
I didn't do anything weird.

23:46.075 --> 23:48.168
- I was helping.
- Let me go.

23:48.377 --> 23:49.571
Now!

23:49.745 --> 23:51.178
Are you thirsty?

23:51.380 --> 23:54.315
Or do you need a bottle
to, you know, tinkle?

23:54.483 --> 23:57.077
- It's okay if you do. I can help.
- Ugh.

23:58.521 --> 24:00.921
- Finally.
- Wait, what? Becky. Becky. Hey, don't.

24:01.457 --> 24:02.788
Don't. Becky!

24:05.494 --> 24:08.827
<i>- Where have you been?
- I got your messages. Problem?</i>

24:08.998 --> 24:10.397
Big problem.

24:11.033 --> 24:12.295
I'm at my parents' cabin.

24:12.902 --> 24:15.462
I've got Sam tied to a bed.
I'm out of elixir.

24:16.438 --> 24:17.598
I need a refill, okay?

24:17.773 --> 24:19.604
This isn't the honeymoon
I had in mind.

24:19.775 --> 24:21.970
Well, some of it is,
but not in this context.

24:22.511 --> 24:24.706
Is this stuff wearing off
faster and faster?

24:24.914 --> 24:26.040
Becky.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.046
Breathe.

24:30.986 --> 24:34.922
Do you know we haven't even
consummated our marriage?

24:36.192 --> 24:39.218
We were taking it slow
because true love is forever...

24:39.695 --> 24:41.959
<i>...but everything feels weird now.
All right.</i>

24:42.565 --> 24:43.657
<i>Meet me in an hour.</i>

24:47.002 --> 24:49.470
So you dosed me with a love potion.

24:49.638 --> 24:50.832
- How...?
- Thin walls.

24:52.808 --> 24:56.141
Look, yes, I used a social lubricant.

24:56.312 --> 24:57.370
You roofied me.

24:57.980 --> 25:00.175
A roofie? I'd never.

25:01.183 --> 25:02.878
We had a great time together.

25:03.052 --> 25:06.215
- You were happy.
- Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.

25:07.189 --> 25:09.054
- I have to go.
- You know your pal Guy...

25:09.225 --> 25:11.489
...is the one icing all those people,
right?

25:11.727 --> 25:14.662
- No, he's not.
- So he's not a witch?

25:14.830 --> 25:16.320
No. Ha, ha.

25:16.498 --> 25:20.264
He's just a Wiccan.
Wiccans are good, like Glinda of Oz.

25:20.469 --> 25:22.562
You're not this stupid, Becky.

25:23.072 --> 25:26.337
Whatever is killing people,
it's something else.

25:26.508 --> 25:27.736
It's never something else.

25:28.344 --> 25:31.905
When are there ever two crazy things
in town at the same time?

25:32.081 --> 25:34.072
Guy is the creep,
and you're on his list.

25:34.783 --> 25:36.910
No. He's my friend.

25:37.086 --> 25:39.054
No, he's your dealer.

25:40.089 --> 25:42.353
Look, I don't know how much
he's charging you...

25:42.524 --> 25:44.754
Nothing. He gives it to me.

25:45.294 --> 25:49.287
And he said it wouldn't even work
unless you already loved me deep down.

25:49.498 --> 25:50.760
It just activates it.

25:52.067 --> 25:53.261
So you think I love you?

25:54.536 --> 25:56.197
Deep, deep down.

25:56.372 --> 25:57.930
Then untie me.

26:03.012 --> 26:04.104
What? No.

26:04.613 --> 26:06.706
You're still working through
your emotions.

26:08.117 --> 26:10.585
- I love you too.
- Ugh.

26:14.290 --> 26:17.384
On the table, next to the nametags.

26:18.260 --> 26:19.818
Guy.

26:22.231 --> 26:24.028
Why don't you take a seat?

26:27.303 --> 26:29.168
Tough day?

26:30.572 --> 26:31.971
Okay, ha, ha.

26:32.474 --> 26:34.305
We can cut right to it if you'd like.

26:38.614 --> 26:40.047
Uh...

26:41.784 --> 26:43.183
Let's talk price.

26:43.919 --> 26:46.683
- What?
- Well, we're past the freebie stage...

26:46.855 --> 26:48.413
...don't you think?

26:48.590 --> 26:51.423
But I thought we were besties.

26:51.960 --> 26:54.656
Oh, ha, ha, honey.

26:54.830 --> 26:57.628
That is so depressingly Becky.

26:57.800 --> 26:58.858
I mean, it's...

26:59.068 --> 27:02.765
You're so pathetic it actually
loops back around again to cute.

27:02.938 --> 27:05.998
Okay. You want me to pay, fine.

27:06.175 --> 27:07.938
Do you accept personal checks?

27:08.110 --> 27:09.270
No.

27:09.445 --> 27:12.175
But I will take your soul.

27:13.982 --> 27:16.473
- You're a Crossroads demon.
- Bingo bango.

27:22.224 --> 27:24.283
I love reunions.

27:24.460 --> 27:25.859
The desperation.

27:26.028 --> 27:31.364
These schlubs will sign on
the dotted line for money, power, hair.

27:31.533 --> 27:33.125
Whatever it takes to impress...

27:33.302 --> 27:36.100
...the nostalgically-bangable
head cheerleader.

27:37.606 --> 27:38.971
Sam was right.

27:39.475 --> 27:41.067
You killed those people.

27:41.243 --> 27:46.977
Well, for legal reasons, let's just say
they had unfortunate accidents.

27:48.317 --> 27:52.344
So, what? I hand over my soul and
the next day a piano falls on my head?

27:52.521 --> 27:55.718
No, I'd never do that to you. Promise.

27:57.025 --> 27:59.425
- I'm not stupid.
- But you are special.

28:00.729 --> 28:02.060
I am?

28:02.231 --> 28:04.995
Hey, I wasn't thrilled...

28:05.167 --> 28:08.193
...to see your new hubby
was Sam freaking Winchester.

28:08.704 --> 28:11.730
If he knew I was here talking to you,
I mean, he'd probably...

28:11.907 --> 28:13.670
- Gank your ass.
- Yes.

28:13.842 --> 28:18.836
And I'm very protective of my ass.
It's one of my best features.

28:21.884 --> 28:25.547
Becky, I'm prepared to offer you
a one-time-only deal.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.216
Not 10 years.

28:28.357 --> 28:29.881
Twenty-five.

28:30.058 --> 28:32.549
No pianos, guaranteed.

28:32.761 --> 28:34.160
Just Sam.

28:36.198 --> 28:38.132
- For my soul?
- And your promise...

28:38.300 --> 28:40.928
...to not breathe a word about this
to the Winchesters.

28:41.103 --> 28:42.434
And I'll be on my merry way.

28:44.106 --> 28:46.370
No one gets a deal like this, Becky.

28:46.542 --> 28:49.033
Not kings, not popes.

28:49.211 --> 28:52.772
I snap my fingers and Sam will love you
for the rest of your life.

28:59.488 --> 29:01.615
I think I'll have that drink now.

29:31.153 --> 29:32.177
Anything?

29:32.354 --> 29:35.790
Uh, she's got 11 Twitter-ers.

29:38.260 --> 29:39.420
Last post.

29:39.595 --> 29:42.428
Uh, "Going on romantic trip
with hubster."

29:42.598 --> 29:43.792
Three exclamation points.

29:44.366 --> 29:46.596
Guess she got excited.

29:48.003 --> 29:49.800
That look romantic to you?

29:49.972 --> 29:51.462
Oh, hell, no.

29:51.640 --> 29:53.540
But I got this thing about fish.

29:54.309 --> 29:55.537
Dead eyes, man.

30:04.987 --> 30:06.454
Heh.

30:21.570 --> 30:22.969
Well...

30:24.206 --> 30:27.073
...this is not how I imagined
spending my reunion.

30:28.777 --> 30:30.745
I was gonna show you off.

30:30.913 --> 30:33.404
Not that anyone actually knows
who you are.

30:33.582 --> 30:37.541
<i>Supernatural is not exactly popular...</i>

30:38.186 --> 30:40.347
...but you're tall...

30:40.522 --> 30:42.387
...and nice...

30:43.425 --> 30:45.325
...and they'd all think I was happy.

30:48.597 --> 30:51.691
You're mad, I get it.

30:57.105 --> 30:59.232
Can we talk?

30:59.408 --> 31:00.705
I know you don't love me.

31:02.077 --> 31:03.442
I know what I am, okay?

31:04.379 --> 31:06.540
I'm a loser.

31:07.382 --> 31:09.350
In school, in life.

31:10.686 --> 31:13.587
- Guess that's why I like you so much.
- What?

31:13.755 --> 31:17.589
I mean, not that you're a loser,
but you had that whole character arc...

31:17.759 --> 31:19.693
...about being a freak...

31:20.028 --> 31:21.461
...and I can relate.

31:23.265 --> 31:27.258
Honestly,
the only place people understood me...

31:27.436 --> 31:28.698
...was the message boards.

31:29.771 --> 31:32.069
They were grumpy and overly-literal...

31:32.240 --> 31:35.903
...but at least we shared
a common passion.

31:36.078 --> 31:38.137
And I'll take it, you know?

31:38.347 --> 31:40.110
Then I met you guys.

31:40.716 --> 31:43.742
The real Sam and Dean.

31:43.952 --> 31:45.544
And I started dating Chuck, ha, ha.

31:46.622 --> 31:48.852
And everything...

31:49.558 --> 31:51.492
...was amazing.

31:56.231 --> 31:57.789
But you left...

31:57.966 --> 32:00.400
...and Chuck dumped me.

32:00.936 --> 32:03.063
I think I intimidated him
with my vibrant sexuality.

32:03.238 --> 32:04.262
Oh, God.

32:04.439 --> 32:06.839
I just want someone
who loves me for me.

32:07.009 --> 32:08.306
Is that too much to ask?

32:12.114 --> 32:13.775
What?

32:15.784 --> 32:18.776
If you want somebody to love you
for you...

32:18.954 --> 32:20.182
...maybe don't drug them.

32:21.023 --> 32:22.615
But I want you.

32:22.791 --> 32:25.521
And this is the only way.

32:26.161 --> 32:27.753
Becky.

32:29.531 --> 32:31.294
Becky, you're better than this.

32:33.535 --> 32:35.025
That's sweet...

32:35.804 --> 32:37.931
...but I'm not so sure.

32:44.546 --> 32:45.672
Becks.

32:45.847 --> 32:47.371
You missed the party.

32:47.549 --> 32:51.144
Yeah, well, weird night.

32:52.421 --> 32:54.048
So, what are we thinking?

32:57.292 --> 32:58.350
Okay.

33:00.462 --> 33:02.123
I'm in.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.674
You're making the right choice.

33:13.842 --> 33:15.241
I know.

33:17.479 --> 33:21.472
- So we seal the deal with a kiss?
- Exactly.

33:22.350 --> 33:23.510
Pucker up, sweetheart.

33:28.256 --> 33:30.554
I'm not your sweetheart.

33:31.493 --> 33:33.051
- Becky.
- Blueberry vodka.

33:33.729 --> 33:35.856
The answer to all life's problems.

33:36.031 --> 33:37.089
You see that, Sam?

33:37.265 --> 33:38.926
I did it just like we said.

33:39.101 --> 33:40.261
I am awesome!

33:40.469 --> 33:41.527
L...

33:41.703 --> 33:43.500
I'll be over here.

33:44.072 --> 33:46.666
Dean Winchester.
This is really thrilling.

33:46.842 --> 33:48.332
Hey, can I have your autograph?

33:50.512 --> 33:51.911
Sure.

33:52.080 --> 33:54.913
Yeah, I'll carve it into your spleen.

33:56.351 --> 33:58.581
So how you running your little scam?

33:58.920 --> 34:01.354
Well, how do you mean, Dean?

34:01.990 --> 34:04.458
Signing 10-year deals,
snuffing them that week.

34:04.626 --> 34:06.059
Well, I would never... No.

34:06.228 --> 34:08.719
Rules of the road.
Can't lay a hair on my clients.

34:08.897 --> 34:10.455
Right. So how you cheating it?

34:10.632 --> 34:12.224
I'm not a cheater.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.594
I'm an innovator.

34:15.070 --> 34:16.799
It's called a loophole, you moron.

34:19.206 --> 34:21.471
Yes.
When a person bargains away his soul...

34:21.643 --> 34:24.703
...he gets a decade, technically.

34:24.880 --> 34:25.938
But accidents happen.

34:26.915 --> 34:29.940
So you're arranging accidents,
collecting early.

34:30.118 --> 34:32.609
Oh, please. White gloves, heh.

34:32.788 --> 34:34.449
I don't get my hands dirty.

34:34.623 --> 34:38.889
That's why it's important
to have a capable intern.

34:45.634 --> 34:47.601
What time did I ask you to be here?

34:48.536 --> 34:52.063
What time did I ask you to be here?

35:08.089 --> 35:09.249
Becky, run.

35:31.313 --> 35:32.439
Whoa.

35:44.359 --> 35:46.520
How many deals you got cooking
in this town?

35:46.695 --> 35:47.787
Fifteen.

35:47.963 --> 35:49.692
Yeah, well, call them off...

35:49.865 --> 35:52.732
...or I'll cut my own loophole
in your throat.

35:52.901 --> 35:54.027
Oh, crap.

35:54.202 --> 35:56.033
Yeah, you said it. You're in a world...

35:56.204 --> 35:58.035
Hello, boys.

35:58.607 --> 36:00.598
Oh, crap.

36:03.245 --> 36:06.043
Sam, mazel tov.
Who's the lucky lady?

36:07.816 --> 36:09.408
You're Crowley.

36:10.352 --> 36:11.649
And you're...

36:11.820 --> 36:15.187
Well, I'm sure
you have a wonderful personality, dear.

36:15.357 --> 36:19.088
Ah, another step and I'll Columbian
necktie your little friend here.

36:19.261 --> 36:21.559
Please, don't let him get off that easy.

36:21.730 --> 36:27.259
- Sir, I don't think that you...
- I know exactly what you've been doing.

36:27.535 --> 36:29.503
A little birdie named Jackson...

36:29.671 --> 36:30.763
...sold you out.

36:30.939 --> 36:33.533
E-mailed all the juicy deets
to my suggestion box.

36:35.911 --> 36:39.540
I assume that's my whistleblower.

36:42.183 --> 36:43.673
Shame.

36:43.852 --> 36:45.046
Had a future.

36:46.454 --> 36:47.751
Unfortunately, you don't.

36:48.423 --> 36:50.015
- I was...
- I only have one rule.

36:50.191 --> 36:52.853
Make a deal, keep it.

36:53.428 --> 36:54.554
Technically, I didn't...

36:54.729 --> 36:58.130
There's a reason we don't call
our chits in early. Consumer confidence.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.598
This isn't Wall Street, this is hell.

37:00.769 --> 37:02.862
We have a little something
called integrity.

37:03.038 --> 37:06.269
If this gets out, who will deal with us?
Nobody. Then where are we?

37:08.209 --> 37:10.541
- I don't know.
- That's right. You don't.

37:10.712 --> 37:13.203
Because you're a stupid,
shortsighted little prat.

37:13.381 --> 37:16.908
Now, hand the jackass over.
I'll cancel every deal he's made.

37:17.118 --> 37:21.054
- What are you gonna do with him?
- Make an example of him.

37:23.925 --> 37:26.826
Fair trade, right?
We'll go our separate ways.

37:28.330 --> 37:30.992
- No harm done.
- Out of the goodness of your heart?

37:32.000 --> 37:34.833
Years of demons at your heels,
haven't seen one for months.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.903
- Wonder why?
- We've been a little busy.

37:37.072 --> 37:39.199
Hunting Leviathan. Yes, I know.

37:40.008 --> 37:43.273
That's why I told my lads
to stay clear of you meatheads.

37:47.148 --> 37:49.013
- What do you know about...?
- Too much.

37:49.217 --> 37:52.914
You met that Dick yet?
Smuggest tub of goo since Mussolini.

37:54.289 --> 37:55.620
I hate the bastards.

37:56.424 --> 37:59.587
Squash them all, please. I'll stay clear.

38:00.829 --> 38:02.228
Rip up the contracts first.

38:03.665 --> 38:05.360
Done and done.

38:07.769 --> 38:08.827
Your turn.

38:09.004 --> 38:10.767
No, no, no.

38:10.939 --> 38:12.133
Let...

38:15.510 --> 38:17.535
Pleasure, gentlemen.

38:21.983 --> 38:23.848
What'd I miss?

38:35.063 --> 38:36.496
It...

38:37.298 --> 38:40.324
It wasn't all bad, right?

38:43.271 --> 38:46.206
Okay, you did save my life...

38:46.374 --> 38:48.638
...and for that, thanks.

38:48.810 --> 38:51.176
So I'll see you again?

38:52.981 --> 38:54.881
Yeah, probably not.

39:09.564 --> 39:11.532
Becky...

39:11.699 --> 39:14.429
...look, you're not a loser, okay?

39:14.602 --> 39:19.062
You're a good person,
and you've got a lot...

39:21.176 --> 39:22.234
...of energy.

39:23.011 --> 39:24.876
So you know what?
Just do your thing...

39:25.046 --> 39:28.914
...whatever that is,
and the right guy will find you.

39:39.727 --> 39:41.217
No.

39:41.830 --> 39:43.320
No.

39:48.069 --> 39:49.696
Well, buddy...

39:49.871 --> 39:54.638
...I gotta say, man,
you, uh, don't suck.

39:54.843 --> 39:55.901
Thank you.

39:56.578 --> 39:59.103
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

40:02.050 --> 40:03.540
Well...

40:05.954 --> 40:06.978
Oh.

40:07.155 --> 40:08.986
Yeah. Ha, ha.

40:09.157 --> 40:10.988
All right, that's...

40:11.159 --> 40:12.217
Thank you.

40:17.866 --> 40:19.493
Take care.

40:20.001 --> 40:21.434
Wow.

40:21.603 --> 40:24.231
- Aw, you made a friend.
- Uh-uh.

40:29.477 --> 40:32.674
Look, man, uh, ahem...

40:32.881 --> 40:35.247
...when I was all dosed up,
I said some crap.

40:35.416 --> 40:37.441
Oh, you mean
she wasn't your soul mate?

40:37.619 --> 40:38.916
Shut up.

40:39.087 --> 40:41.487
I mean,
I do need you watching my back.

40:41.656 --> 40:42.748
Obviously.

40:42.924 --> 40:45.688
Yeah. When crazy groupies attack.

40:45.894 --> 40:46.952
You know what I mean.

40:48.129 --> 40:49.187
I gotta say, man...

40:50.098 --> 40:52.794
...for a whack job,
you really pulled it together.

40:52.967 --> 40:54.764
That's the nicest thing
anyone's said to me.

40:56.137 --> 40:57.832
Look, don't be too impressed, man.

40:58.006 --> 41:01.772
I'm still a Denver Scramble up here. I
just know my way around the plate now.

41:01.943 --> 41:03.911
I'm just saying...

41:04.846 --> 41:07.838
...it's stupid to think
that you need me around all the time.

41:08.516 --> 41:09.710
You're a grown-up.

41:10.318 --> 41:11.410
Right.

41:12.353 --> 41:14.446
You're a hike-in-the-desert,
hippie douche grownup.

41:14.622 --> 41:16.681
Ha, ha, dude, I was camping.

41:16.858 --> 41:19.793
- You camp.
- Yeah, whatever, hippie.

41:19.961 --> 41:23.362
You know what, though? Seriously?
It might be nice.

41:23.531 --> 41:26.295
- What?
- You've been looking out for me...

41:26.467 --> 41:27.525
...your whole life.

41:27.702 --> 41:31.570
Now you finally get
to take care of yourself.

41:31.739 --> 41:32.831
About time, huh?

41:33.708 --> 41:35.175
Yeah.

41:35.810 --> 41:37.334
Right.
