is an awesome board game...

Chardee MacDennis—
the game of games.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.043
Now what we did is,
we took our favorite aspects...

02:06.126 --> 02:08.711
of a bunch of different board games
and we mashed 'em all together.

02:08.794 --> 02:11.340
We did the same thing with the name,
'cause we couldn't agree upon one.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.383
Now the point of the game
is actually quite simple.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.761
It's a race to the finish
from level one to level three.

02:15.886 --> 02:19.264
[ Charlie ] This is the board. And
we start at level one, which is “Mind.”

02:19.348 --> 02:22.809
That consists of “Trivia,”
“Puzzles” and “Artistry.”

02:22.893 --> 02:26.396
It is also the level at which the
alcohol being consumed is wine.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.607
Whoa! You get to drink
during the game?

02:28.690 --> 02:30.984

I"m not gonna play any game in
which I'm not getting annihilated.

02:33.362 --> 02:36.031
Moving on to level two,
which is “Body”—

02:36.114 --> 02:39.368
“Physical Challenge,” “Pain” and
“Endurance.” That's the beer level.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.328
Yes, and level three
is “Spirit'—

and “Public Humiliation.”

- This is very important, Frank.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.005
We gotta nail the board
down to the bar,

because at a certain
point during the game,

02:53.882 --> 02:56.301
Mac's gonna get very pissed off
'cause he's not doing very well.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.762
- He's gonna try and flip the board over.
- He's right. It's for the best.

nailed down. [ Dennis ] He will.

03:00.972 --> 03:04.393
Here's a big one. There's a
15-minute time limit to the game.

03:04.476 --> 03:06.728
Fifteen minutes doesn't seem
like a long time for a game.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.563
Well, there's a fair
amount of clock stoppages.

03:08.647 --> 03:10.273
Yeah, each team
gets three time-outs.

03:10.357 --> 03:13.110
There's a halftime, post-level
breaks, a two-minute warning...

03:13.235 --> 03:16.488
and a significant amount of injury
stoppages. Hence the first-aid kit.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.448
Pay very close attention
to this next part.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.368
Each team must collect a certain
number of cards at each level...

03:21.451 --> 03:22.911
in order to progress
to the next level.

03:22.994 --> 03:26.707
And the first team to complete
all three levels wins the game.

winner gets a sweet prize.

Nice, right?

03:45.308 --> 03:47.394
And these...

03:47.477 --> 03:49.896
are Mac and Charlie's pieces.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.441
Look at the condition that
they're in. Pretty pathetic.

03:52.524 --> 03:55.152
As you can see from the state
that these pieces are in,

03:55.235 --> 03:57.446
Mac and Charlie have
never, ever,

weak, so I think it's a wash.
