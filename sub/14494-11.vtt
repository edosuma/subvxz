WEBVTT

00:09.090 --> 00:09.991
That's him.

00:09.991 --> 00:12.450
Wait. What am I looking for again?

00:12.450 --> 00:14.959
- A giant cat?
- It was a man.

00:14.959 --> 00:17.688
Can the projectionist
make this brighter?

00:19.270 --> 00:20.836
Uh, sure.

00:20.836 --> 00:23.262
JARVIS, run a full
spectrum analysis, will you?

00:23.262 --> 00:25.075
And make it brighter.

00:25.596 --> 00:26.560
Look at that.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.372
Whatever he's wearing, it's
absorbent to all energy spectra.

00:29.372 --> 00:31.131
And what he did to JARVIS.

00:31.131 --> 00:33.806
The system still doesn't register there
having been another person there.

00:33.806 --> 00:35.186
Okay, fine. I'll admit it.

00:35.186 --> 00:37.983
Whoever this intruder is,
he's got some okay technology.

00:37.983 --> 00:40.942
All I know is that this
man in black saved my life.

00:40.942 --> 00:42.885
He's an ally, not an enemy.

00:42.885 --> 00:45.126
<i>Intruder alert.</i>

00:50.253 --> 00:52.526
So he's not an Avenger?

00:52.526 --> 00:54.153
Definitely not.

02:04.603 --> 02:07.084
You think you're fast?
Dodge these.

02:08.013 --> 02:10.406
- What happened?
- Well, he didn't dodge them.

02:10.406 --> 02:12.710
I did mention that his suit
seemed to be absorbent to...

02:12.710 --> 02:13.897
Watch out!

02:24.010 --> 02:26.702
Now, are you ready to talk about this?

02:33.169 --> 02:34.353
That sound.

02:34.683 --> 02:36.391
That's Vibranium.

02:36.795 --> 02:37.667
You know what?

02:37.667 --> 02:40.946
I've had just about enough
of super-tech-cat-ninja guy.

02:45.143 --> 02:46.319
I agree.

02:55.538 --> 02:56.858
Hank!

03:00.431 --> 03:02.125
Don't even think about it.

03:02.125 --> 03:03.265
Enough.

03:03.688 --> 03:05.433
What's your game, mister?

03:05.433 --> 03:07.368
You save my life and then attack us.

03:07.368 --> 03:10.571
And now you expect us to believe
you're just going to surrender?

03:10.571 --> 03:12.988
I am not surrendering, Captain.

03:12.988 --> 03:16.046
I have simply seen enough.

03:16.046 --> 03:18.910
I wanted to asses your
abilities firsthand.

03:20.412 --> 03:21.925
I am T'Challa.

03:21.925 --> 03:23.252
The Prince of Wakanda.

03:23.252 --> 03:25.514
But what are you doing here?

03:27.910 --> 03:29.527
I need your help.

03:31.987 --> 03:33.280
What do you need our help for?

03:33.280 --> 03:35.242
You kind of mopped the
floor with all four of us.

03:35.242 --> 03:38.464
Yeah, well, for the record,
I was holding back. But Jane's right.

03:38.464 --> 03:40.994
We're kind of busy with an
army of escaped super-villains.

03:40.994 --> 03:44.053
My country has been
overthrown by such a villain.

03:44.053 --> 03:47.426
A brutal fiend called
M'Baku, the Man-Ape.

03:47.426 --> 03:49.574
I need your help to get
past the Wakandan people

03:49.574 --> 03:51.272
so I can restore the throne.

03:51.272 --> 03:53.802
Get past the Wakandan people?

03:53.802 --> 03:57.177
If your people are following this
Man-Ape of their own free will,

03:57.177 --> 03:58.830
that's the end of the story.

03:58.830 --> 04:02.177
- That's what the people want.
- You do not understand.

04:03.831 --> 04:05.620
The people are the problem.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.746
They follow the old ways.

04:09.106 --> 04:11.020
Man-Ape won the throne in combat.

04:11.020 --> 04:14.367
They feel they must follow him, no
matter if he destroys everything.

04:14.367 --> 04:18.437
And the Man-Ape will
destroy everything.

04:18.437 --> 04:21.051
I don't get it. I'm sure
he's bad news and all,

04:21.051 --> 04:23.347
but how can he destroy everything?

04:26.154 --> 04:27.606
Vibranium.

04:27.606 --> 04:30.558
I've studied it first hand.
It's nothing to mess around with.

04:30.558 --> 04:33.056
And legend has Wakanda's
sitting on a mountain of it.

04:33.056 --> 04:35.032
The Vibranium Mound.

04:35.032 --> 04:38.251
It is our treasure
and our responsibility.

04:38.251 --> 04:41.618
For centuries we have defended it
against any who would exploit it.

04:41.618 --> 04:43.976
That kind of resource
should belong to everyone.

04:43.976 --> 04:46.513
Vibranium has the potential
to change the world.

04:46.513 --> 04:50.437
I agree, but not
necessarily for the better.

04:50.876 --> 04:54.113
Uh, yeah, Stark Industries
investigated the possibility

04:54.113 --> 04:56.366
of using Vibranium to make weapons.

04:56.785 --> 04:58.251
It was a long time ago.

04:58.251 --> 05:00.457
My people tried to
deal with King T'Chaka.

05:00.457 --> 05:01.761
Where is he now?

05:04.329 --> 05:07.136
If this Man-Ape is going
to put lives in danger,

05:07.136 --> 05:08.576
we have to do something.

05:08.576 --> 05:11.189
Lives are in danger, Avenger.

05:11.397 --> 05:13.968
Computer, satellite view of Wakanda.

05:14.404 --> 05:17.106
Wakanda can't be seen on satellite.
Trust me, I've tried.

05:17.106 --> 05:18.381
Zoom in.

05:21.410 --> 05:24.069
Okay, how exactly do you know
my systems inside and out?

05:24.069 --> 05:25.353
I studied them...

05:25.960 --> 05:27.640
inside and out.

05:31.053 --> 05:32.337
HYDRA.

05:32.337 --> 05:34.844
That's Grim Reaper.
One of Strucker's guys.

05:34.844 --> 05:36.236
But who's Abe Lincoln there?

05:36.236 --> 05:37.470
I've met him.

05:37.470 --> 05:39.180
Ulysses Klaw.

05:39.180 --> 05:42.992
He created a device that converts
Vibranium into a sonic weapon.

05:44.503 --> 05:47.432
So who's up for invading Wakanda?

06:02.469 --> 06:04.859
Thor still isn't
responding to his to ID card.

06:04.859 --> 06:07.216
Probably taking a trip to fantasy land.

06:08.338 --> 06:10.730
So we need to go
through Torment Forest,

06:10.730 --> 06:14.157
past Piranha Cove, but we
have to avoid the Chasm of...

06:14.157 --> 06:16.713
What was it? Icy Clouds?

06:16.713 --> 06:18.856
- Chilling Mists.
- Right.

06:19.895 --> 06:21.325
You okay, Cap?

06:21.325 --> 06:23.689
In my day, if something went this high,

06:23.689 --> 06:25.203
we didn't call it an airplane.

06:25.203 --> 06:26.620
What did you call it?

06:27.147 --> 06:28.752
Science fiction.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.713
This is not the path
I laid out. You should avoid this area.

06:36.713 --> 06:38.566
The jungle here is too well protected.

06:38.566 --> 06:42.113
Don't worry, the Quinjet has
the best cloaking tech there is.

06:42.113 --> 06:42.969
Mine.

06:44.290 --> 06:46.095
Wakanda defense tech is better.

07:10.334 --> 07:12.040
You owe me a jet.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.222
You chose not to listen to me, Stark.

07:14.222 --> 07:15.758
It was a mistake.

07:15.758 --> 07:17.406
You and me need to have
a little talk, kitty.

07:17.406 --> 07:18.943
Hey, would you look at the time?

07:18.943 --> 07:22.204
Shouldn't we be somewhere?
Like in a big fight against HYDRA?

07:22.657 --> 07:23.801
Right, here's the plan.

07:23.801 --> 07:26.327
We take down HYDRA and
protect the Vibranium Mound.

07:26.327 --> 07:27.706
Then we deal with Man-Ape.

07:27.706 --> 07:31.305
Don't under estimate the Wakandan army
which is heading this way.

07:31.606 --> 07:33.067
I wish you well,

07:33.302 --> 07:35.936
but I will deal with Man-Ape myself.

07:38.239 --> 07:40.081
And he left.

07:40.081 --> 07:42.056
You have got to be
kidding me. What, I...

07:42.056 --> 07:44.257
Okay, fine.
Cap, go after him.

07:44.257 --> 07:45.935
But you need...

07:45.935 --> 07:47.275
Understood.

07:47.973 --> 07:50.091
Wow, he didn't argue
with me or anything.

07:50.091 --> 07:51.663
Uh, everyone, take notes.

07:51.663 --> 07:53.883
He's a soldier, he follows orders.

07:53.883 --> 07:55.341
Even bad ones.

07:55.341 --> 07:59.205
Now, it's just the three of us against
all of Wakanda, HYDRA, and a super-villain.

07:59.205 --> 08:00.797
That's how much faith I have in you two.

08:00.797 --> 08:02.877
Come on, I've dealt with HYDRA before.

08:02.877 --> 08:04.988
And Wakanda, not a problem.

08:16.594 --> 08:18.488
Okay, maybe a little problem.

08:25.720 --> 08:30.246
And that is only scratching the
surface of the metal's potential.

08:30.246 --> 08:32.388
An army equipped
with these could...

08:32.388 --> 08:33.745
It'll do.

08:33.745 --> 08:37.955
Baron Strucker and HYDRA thank you
for your openness, Your Highness.

08:37.955 --> 08:39.203
You think me a fool?

08:39.203 --> 08:42.876
I know you outsiders value the Vibranium
more than the gold you offer.

08:42.876 --> 08:44.451
I'm not one to judge.

08:44.451 --> 08:48.184
The Vibranium has corrupted
Wakanda, weakened it.

08:48.184 --> 08:50.499
I will restore my land
to its natural state

08:50.499 --> 08:52.978
without the Panther Tribe's technology.

08:52.978 --> 08:56.948
If HYDRA will pay my price,
they are welcome to it.

08:56.948 --> 08:59.910
They will pay more for the Vibranium.

08:59.910 --> 09:03.273
- Let me
- Klaw, watch yourself.

09:03.273 --> 09:08.310
If Strucker thinks he can cut me out,
he's sorely mistaken.

09:08.310 --> 09:12.592
Only I have the technology to tap
into the Vibranium'3 power.

09:12.592 --> 09:16.835
You do as I say, or that metal
will blow up right in your face.

09:16.835 --> 09:19.013
Now, that's not very friendly, is it?

09:19.013 --> 09:20.455
Lord M'Baku,

09:20.455 --> 09:24.152
Wakandan defenses have shot
down an unidentified aircraft.

09:24.152 --> 09:28.209
An army division has engaged
outsiders within our borders.

09:32.317 --> 09:36.294
If HYDRA crosses me, you
will not live to regret it.

09:36.294 --> 09:39.112
No, this isn't HYDRA.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.120
This is something else.

09:45.625 --> 09:47.254
Your tenacity is admirable,

09:47.254 --> 09:49.800
but you are very out of
place in the jungle, Captain.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.583
You came to us for help, so here I am.

09:52.583 --> 09:55.083
This is my burden to bear alone.

09:55.083 --> 09:58.435
So the Avengers were what?
A distraction?

09:58.435 --> 10:00.911
You're just using us to
get past your own people?

10:00.911 --> 10:02.683
Man-Ape is mine.

10:02.683 --> 10:06.540
Well, I've got my orders.
Besides, I owe you one.

10:06.540 --> 10:08.317
You saved my life, remember?

10:08.317 --> 10:12.106
So you can let me help you,
or we can go another round?

10:15.182 --> 10:18.302
Man-Ape took my father and did nothing.

10:18.302 --> 10:19.659
I failed him.

10:19.659 --> 10:22.090
I know you can understand that, Captain.

10:22.504 --> 10:25.460
Please, let me do this.

10:34.505 --> 10:36.896
Okay, so that was......

10:36.896 --> 10:38.897
a little harder than it should've been.

10:40.083 --> 10:42.186
For an uncharted African nation,

10:42.186 --> 10:45.059
they've got tech that's decades
ahead of anything we've got.

10:45.059 --> 10:47.263
If HYDRA gets their
hands on any of this...

10:47.263 --> 10:48.235
They won't.

10:48.235 --> 10:50.977
But I kind of wish Thor
would answer his stupid phone.

10:53.884 --> 10:56.133
Are warriors in the
jungle do not respond.

10:56.133 --> 10:59.251
I beg you, rid Wakanda
of all the outsiders.

10:59.251 --> 11:00.492
T'Chaka would never.

11:00.492 --> 11:01.892
I am king!

11:01.892 --> 11:03.730
Not the Black Panther.

11:03.730 --> 11:06.102
The Black Panther is no more.

11:06.102 --> 11:08.172
You are wrong M'Baku.

11:08.172 --> 11:11.934
The Black Panther challenges you
for the throne of Wakanda.

11:11.934 --> 11:13.336
T'Challa.

11:13.757 --> 11:15.453
A challenged has been issued.

11:15.453 --> 11:17.581
By tribal law, you must.

11:18.894 --> 11:21.161
I have no use for tradition.

11:21.161 --> 11:23.332
Crush the panther cub.

11:37.242 --> 11:38.630
You're on our list, pal.

11:38.630 --> 11:41.221
I think you're number 34,
but we can take you early.

11:41.221 --> 11:44.617
Finally, someone to hurt.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.068
Are you all insane?

11:50.068 --> 11:52.809
You cannot do this
in the Vibranium mine!

11:53.581 --> 11:56.207
Do you know what I
like most about Africa?

11:56.207 --> 11:58.120
<i>Dorylus mandibularis.</i>

11:58.120 --> 12:00.615
Better known as African Army Ants.

12:11.555 --> 12:13.964
Pym, you fool.

12:13.964 --> 12:17.881
The Vibranium Mound,
if it absorbs too much energy

12:17.881 --> 12:19.386
It'll overload.

12:19.386 --> 12:20.566
And with that much Vibranium,

12:20.566 --> 12:22.803
the explosion will
take out half of Africa.

12:22.803 --> 12:24.898
Wasp! Iron-Man!

12:27.256 --> 12:29.806
No, everyone stay back.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.795
I think we're done with you, Klaw.

12:50.457 --> 12:52.276
Klaw, no!

13:07.176 --> 13:11.691
The sound. The sound!

13:12.277 --> 13:15.703
I am the sound.

13:21.758 --> 13:25.225
I can hear you.

13:25.225 --> 13:28.947
HYDRA, you snakes.

13:33.884 --> 13:35.027
Wasp.

13:35.027 --> 13:35.862
I'm on it.

13:48.602 --> 13:51.852
All ships, take whatever
Vibranium you have and launch.

13:51.852 --> 13:53.467
HYDRA's pulling out.

13:54.906 --> 13:56.366
That's mine.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.402
So does anyone have a plan?

14:03.402 --> 14:06.383
Mine is earplugs, but
it's kind of short term.

14:20.134 --> 14:23.169
Your father trained them well, cub.

14:23.637 --> 14:25.763
You do not have to do this.

14:32.561 --> 14:36.734
You can face Man-Ape alone.
Anyone else is fair game.

14:36.734 --> 14:39.410
Tear the outsider apart.

14:39.410 --> 14:42.364
I will deal with the panther.

14:46.881 --> 14:49.935
Sting, sting, bug, sting.

14:50.963 --> 14:53.304
Bugs get crushed.

16:04.535 --> 16:07.926
Shall I show you the same mercy
you showed my father?

16:07.926 --> 16:10.845
Ask him yourself when you join him.

16:16.282 --> 16:17.508
T'Challa!

16:23.220 --> 16:24.963
A gift from Klaw.

16:25.168 --> 16:29.323
Fitting you meet your ending
the same way your father did.

16:29.638 --> 16:32.340
But you are not even the man he was.

16:32.340 --> 16:34.725
You go to outsiders for help.

16:34.725 --> 16:38.263
No outsider can help you now.

16:58.947 --> 17:02.088
I am not the same man
as my father, M'Baku,

17:02.088 --> 17:04.589
for my rage is greater.

17:14.766 --> 17:16.999
Blasting him wasn't your best plan.

17:16.999 --> 17:17.787
No kidding.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.992
Hank, you know Vibranium
better than anyone else.

17:19.992 --> 17:22.212
What happened and how do we stop it?

17:22.212 --> 17:23.262
Whatever's happened to Klaw

17:23.262 --> 17:25.932
it would appear that he's
become some kind of sound-form.

17:25.932 --> 17:28.585
His body is now made of pure sound.

17:28.585 --> 17:30.912
So we have to shut him up. How?

17:31.444 --> 17:32.816
I saw Klaw transform.

17:32.816 --> 17:35.639
I can't explain it,
but his sound form is

17:35.639 --> 17:38.474
somehow being projected
from his sonic emitter.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.299
And we can contain it with
the same thing that created it.

17:41.299 --> 17:42.381
Vibranium.

17:42.381 --> 17:44.049
Jan, you keep Klaw busy.

17:44.049 --> 17:45.868
Tony and I have work to do.

17:58.912 --> 18:03.197
This is the man who has
brought catastrophe to our land.

18:03.456 --> 18:08.266
The one who took your king
through cowardice and dishonor.

18:11.874 --> 18:13.267
T'Challa.

18:13.267 --> 18:15.602
T'Challa! T'Challa!

18:15.602 --> 18:18.968
T'Challa! T'Challa! T'Challa! T'Challa!

18:18.968 --> 18:21.830
T'Challa! T'Challa! T'Challa!

18:25.398 --> 18:27.498
You should have given up
when you had the chance.

18:27.498 --> 18:29.650
Because now that you're a giant...

18:29.650 --> 18:32.691
50-foot-tall energy thing,
you're going down.

18:33.031 --> 18:34.796
We might have let you slide before.

18:40.969 --> 18:43.055
No, you're right. We wouldn't have.

18:43.055 --> 18:46.089
Enough. Enough!

18:46.089 --> 18:49.023
Your wings make sound.

18:49.023 --> 18:51.645
Annoying sound.

18:51.645 --> 18:55.181
Sound is vibration, sound pressure.

18:56.905 --> 18:57.967
Pressure!

19:17.911 --> 19:21.084
Honestly, I thought this plan
would be a little more high-tech.

19:21.084 --> 19:23.554
The Vibranium should contain the
sound from Klaw's sonic emitter.

19:23.554 --> 19:25.806
There's just a small chance
that the vibrational shockwave

19:25.806 --> 19:28.747
could case destructive
inference and then explode.

19:30.311 --> 19:31.882
I heard destructive and explode.

19:31.882 --> 19:33.752
And of course we have to
get to the emitter first.

19:33.752 --> 19:35.064
You'll have to fly into Klaw.

19:35.064 --> 19:38.377
It might, uh, tingle a lot.

19:39.231 --> 19:40.428
Great.

19:44.855 --> 19:48.242
This is less like tingle.
More like horrible pain!

19:48.242 --> 19:52.679
<i>Structural failure
in 5, 4, 3, 2...</i>

19:52.679 --> 19:53.869
Got it

20:01.296 --> 20:02.703
I can't believe that worked.

20:02.703 --> 20:05.368
Tony, you did great.
How do you feel?

20:06.717 --> 20:09.270
Great. Now make me stop vibrating.

20:18.159 --> 20:21.241
The true King of Wakanda has returned.

20:21.557 --> 20:24.976
Now we may purify our
land of the outsiders

20:24.976 --> 20:27.280
and return to the old ways

20:27.280 --> 20:29.067
Rise, my friend.

20:29.067 --> 20:31.537
Outsiders may have threatened Wakanda,

20:31.537 --> 20:33.944
but outsiders saved us as well.

20:34.626 --> 20:37.751
The old ways allowed Man-Ape to do this

20:37.751 --> 20:40.527
and the old ways must change.

20:41.783 --> 20:45.709
My first order as King is to
let the Council lead Wakanda.

20:45.972 --> 20:47.859
A council of the people.

20:47.859 --> 20:50.327
We can no longer hide ourselves away,

20:50.327 --> 20:53.117
waiting for our enemies to come to us.

20:53.117 --> 20:55.885
What happens in Wakanda
affects the world,

20:55.885 --> 20:58.489
so I will go out into the world.

20:58.489 --> 21:01.640
I will fight alongside our new allies.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.647
You attacked us, you
used us, you abandoned us.

21:04.647 --> 21:07.806
Now you want to join us?
Why should we trust you?

21:07.806 --> 21:10.910
You shouldn't it. I will earn your trust

21:10.910 --> 21:13.034
should you allow me to join you.

21:13.626 --> 21:16.895
He's probably our best
bet for a ride home, too.

21:16.895 --> 21:18.009
You're in.

21:20.353 --> 21:25.080
<i>Attention SHIELD command, this is
Hulkbuster unit 221, approaching the CUBE.</i>

21:25.080 --> 21:27.202
<i>We are go for recon.</i>

21:28.500 --> 21:30.514
Stay sharp.
I don't want any...
