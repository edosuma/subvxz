00:15.680 --> 00:18.360
If I might have everyone's attention.

00:19.400 --> 00:22.360
As you know, since the merging of
City and County,

00:22.400 --> 00:24.440
to create Thames Valley,

00:24.480 --> 00:29.040
the future of Cowley police station
has been in the balance.

00:30.400 --> 00:33.520
I have this day
received news from Division.

00:33.560 --> 00:37.640
The station is to be
reduced to a skeleton staff

00:37.680 --> 00:40.000
by the 23rd of the month.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.000
And will be closed, permanently,

00:43.040 --> 00:45.160
at midnight on the 30th.

00:46.240 --> 00:49.160
Details of future placements

00:49.200 --> 00:52.880
will be sent to each of you in due
course.

00:55.080 --> 00:58.400
I know I can rely on all of you
to discharge your duty

00:58.440 --> 01:01.440
with the same professionalism

01:01.480 --> 01:05.680
I have come to so admire
these past years.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.000
That's all. Carry on.

01:07.040 --> 01:10.000
(Requiem In C Minor continues)

01:40.040 --> 01:42.040
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)

01:53.720 --> 01:55.840
It's a remarkable stroke of good
fortune

01:55.880 --> 01:58.480
that you should be able
to join us at such short notice.

01:58.520 --> 02:02.160
Well, I'm very grateful
for the opportunity, Headmaster.

02:03.160 --> 02:06.120
Coldwater has a long history,

02:06.160 --> 02:10.759
but I like to think we live in the
present and look to the future.

02:10.800 --> 02:14.360
Of course,
Mr Ivory coached the First XV.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.640
Oh, and he was also responsible
for the end-of-term school play.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.040
Oh. What play?

02:20.080 --> 02:22.120
Shakespeare, I believe.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.600
(GUNSHOTS)

02:24.640 --> 02:26.760
That's just the cadets.

02:26.800 --> 02:29.800
Coldwater has a great martial
tradition.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.680
Now, in addition to your classroom
duties,

02:32.720 --> 02:35.360
you will also act as House Master
to Foxhole.

02:35.400 --> 02:38.480
Ah, Mr Bodnar. This is Mr Morse.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.920
The new man with the Lower Sixth.
Perhaps you could show him to his
room?

02:41.960 --> 02:43.360
Yeah. Of course, Headmaster.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.920
I look forward to seeing you
in chapel for assembly.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.960
Right, sir.

02:50.640 --> 02:54.320
Oh, welcome to St Bastard's. "Ye who
enter here, all hope abandon."

02:54.360 --> 02:56.360
Thanks.
Alun Bodnar.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.240
Fifth Form and chemistry.
Have you been here long?

02:59.280 --> 03:01.160
Long enough not to mind any more.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.360
Found my point of neutral buoyancy.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.200
I lack ambition
and that killer instinct.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.240
Don't run, boy!

03:09.120 --> 03:11.600
Though I daresay
that could be rekindled.

03:11.640 --> 03:14.200
It's just this way.

03:14.240 --> 03:18.520
He was married, wasn't he?
Mr Ivory. Yeah, that's right.

03:18.560 --> 03:21.760
Headmaster's letting her stay on
at one of the gatekeepers' cottages,

03:21.800 --> 03:23.880
just till the end of term.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.480
Kate. Nice girl.

03:26.520 --> 03:28.520
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

03:29.520 --> 03:31.960
I hope you'll let me
stand you a pint at your earliest.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.200
Yes. Thank you.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.520
You want me to pose as a teacher?

03:48.560 --> 03:50.960
It's Division's idea.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.320
Bring in an outside man.
How's that, sir?

03:53.360 --> 03:56.880
Someone uninvolved,
fresh pair of eyes on the situation.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.560
Seems a lot of trouble to go to
for one missing person.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.000
Who is he?
John Ivory.

04:02.040 --> 04:06.200
Classics master
at a boys' school called Coldwater.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.400
Last seen leaving the village pub

04:08.440 --> 04:10.840
shortly after six,
on October the 4th.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.760
The local Detective Inspector
and his bagman

04:13.800 --> 04:17.760
lost their lives in a road traffic
accident with an articulated lorry.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.240
We've found no evidence
that connects them but...

04:20.279 --> 04:23.920
understandably, Division are keen
to close the case one way or another.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.960
It's all in there.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.600
Just see if you can't
get under the skin of the place.

04:29.640 --> 04:34.040
If there was anything untoward, the
staff might be more inclined to
confide in one of their own.

04:34.080 --> 04:38.800
Oh. There is one more thing
worth mentioning.

04:38.840 --> 04:41.080
You won't be alone.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.720
Upstairs think
that the women at the school

04:43.760 --> 04:46.280
are more likely to confide
in another woman, is that it?

04:46.320 --> 04:49.800
I suppose. It don't seem much like
proper coppering to me.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.320
Tomorrow's world. Pity.

04:54.360 --> 04:59.080
I'd hoped we might get
one last decent collar...together.

04:59.120 --> 05:03.800
This Cromwell Ames character,
Eddie Nero. Both if we're lucky.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.840
Maybe they'll cancel each other out.

05:05.880 --> 05:09.400
It's who else they cancel out in the
meantime. That's what bothers me.

05:09.440 --> 05:12.600
I've got Fancy on surveillance.
Something will give sooner or later.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.160
We should be getting back.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.280
No. Another five minutes
will be all right.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.280
God, I love this place.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.600
You should've seen their faces -
Win and the kids -

05:25.640 --> 05:27.840
when I brought 'em here for
the first time.

05:27.880 --> 05:30.000
We'd been two-up, back-to-back
in the Smoke.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.280
Couldn't believe
somewhere like this existed.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.320
Not after bomb sites and soot.

05:34.360 --> 05:38.040
It was like stepping out of black
and white and into colour.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.280
So, you still mean to go through
with it?

05:41.360 --> 05:44.400
Station closing?
Decision's made for me.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.720
Too set in my ways
to start over somewhere new.

05:50.160 --> 05:53.240
Besides, Win'd have my guts
if I let her down now.

05:54.680 --> 05:57.760
No. Each thing in its season.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.880
You'll be all right.

06:02.920 --> 06:05.840
This undercover caper up the school
is only a week or two.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.160
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

06:14.080 --> 06:17.160
I went into the village today.
How was that?

06:17.200 --> 06:19.200
The shopkeeper said one of the boys

06:19.240 --> 06:21.360
used to come in
on Ivory's behalf most days,

06:21.400 --> 06:24.000
for 40 Fusiliers
and a half-bottle of whisky.

06:24.040 --> 06:26.040
Really?

06:26.080 --> 06:28.080
And how was the pub?

06:28.120 --> 06:30.320
The wives of respectable young
schoolteachers

06:30.360 --> 06:33.440
don't go into pubs by themselves.
So what did the landlord say?

06:35.520 --> 06:38.000
Ivory did stop by on the night
in question.

06:38.040 --> 06:41.320
He had a couple of drinks,
and then left about 6.15

06:41.360 --> 06:43.560
to meet someone called Agnes.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.960
Agnes what?
Er...Davis, maybe?

06:46.000 --> 06:49.200
The landlord couldn't be sure. Ivory
was always bragging about women.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.960
Really?
The garage was closed.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.480
What are the boys like? I don't
know. I haven't met them yet.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.840
What are we doing?
This is such a waste of time.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.920
Just following orders.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.960
Division clearly thinks this is
important.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.320
It's not every day a Detective
Inspector and his bagman die in a
car crash.

07:09.360 --> 07:13.160
It's happenstance, surely.
Nothing sinister. Hm.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.360
Have you checked upstairs?
This afternoon.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.440
There's no sign of the previous
occupants. It's all rather Spartan.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.480
The plumbing's positively medieval.
The sink's backing up.

07:22.520 --> 07:25.000
We might have to get a man out.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.400
It's just the one bed, I'm afraid.

07:27.440 --> 07:30.400
Well, I can take the couch.
Don't be ridiculous.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.960
How's that going to look
if someone comes knocking?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
(WATER GURGLING)

07:50.720 --> 07:52.680
"Dearest Mother..."
Give it back!

07:52.720 --> 07:55.520
"Thank you for the ten shillings
you sent me for my birthday."

07:55.560 --> 07:58.640
You know the rule, squit.
Hand it over. Oi! Stop that at once!

07:58.680 --> 08:01.840
If I have to repeat myself you'll
all be on detention

08:01.880 --> 08:04.080
till the end of term. Is that clear?

08:05.720 --> 08:08.400
What's going on?
Natural selection, sir.

08:08.440 --> 08:12.120
Survival of the fittest, sir.
Mensch und Ubermensch, sir.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.160
Go on, all of you.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.080
Go on!

08:23.320 --> 08:25.840
What's all this?
Praetorians' privilege, sir.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.320
To beast the squits. Well, if it
happens again, you come and see me.

08:29.360 --> 08:31.360
All right?

08:32.679 --> 08:35.159
Go on. On your way. Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.640
Hey. Wait a minute.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.080
Aggravine.
Adsum.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.960
Babcock.
Adsum.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.280
Clunchfist.

Adsum.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.560
Morris Minor.
Adsum.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.600
You mean Morry Thou, sir.

09:24.640 --> 09:26.680
That's what Mr Ivory
used to call him, sir.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.560
After the car, sir.
It's a joke, sir.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.800
On account of his being a Jew, sir.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.600
Well, we'll have none of that here.
I don't mind, sir.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.760
Well, you should. But he doesn't,
sir. I heard him. Thank you.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.120
Erm...Nero.

09:40.160 --> 09:44.680
Here. Adsum, you bloody oik.
(SNIGGERING)

09:46.240 --> 09:47.640
Queach.
Adsum.

09:47.680 --> 09:49.400
Rowntree.
Absum, sir.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.160
Abest.
He's not here, sir.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.880
Where is he?
He was expelled, sir.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.320
Cast out, sir.
Banished, sir.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.800
Black-balled, sir.
Consigned to outer darkness.

09:57.840 --> 10:02.960
I see, thank you. Summerhead. Adsum.
And Zec. Choir. Right.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.520
Ovid's Metamorphoses.
Lines 225 to 230.

10:06.560 --> 10:09.160
Daedalus and Icarus.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.200
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

10:51.040 --> 10:53.040
Right.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.640
(YAPPING)
Oh!

10:56.680 --> 11:00.360
Oh. Let's get one.
Come on.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.600
THURSDAY: Brett Nero?
Eddie's kept that quiet.

11:04.640 --> 11:07.240
That could be why Division
have taken such an interest.

11:07.280 --> 11:08.840
If Nero's son's at the school?

11:08.880 --> 11:11.360
Mr Bright would have mentioned it
if that was the case.

11:11.400 --> 11:14.760
Just happenstance, surely.
His kid's got to go somewhere.

11:14.800 --> 11:18.680
Well, if her condition worsens,
then please give me a call.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.320
Thank you. I'm sorry, I couldn't find
a telephone.

11:21.360 --> 11:25.480
The office telephone is for school
business, not personal matters.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.160
But I suppose if it's urgent.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.720
You're the new man.
That's right. Morse.

11:31.760 --> 11:34.080
Miss...
Mackenzie. Ravenna.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.960
I think you're supposed to be
on break duty?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.920
Ah, yes.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.600
There's a payphone,
in the vestibule.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.640
For next time.

11:45.680 --> 11:47.680
Oh. Thank you.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.920
(PUPPY YAPPING)

12:11.160 --> 12:13.160
Get down!

12:21.040 --> 12:23.240
THURSDAY:
Sounds like you had a close shave.

12:24.480 --> 12:27.080
I've had closer.
Cromwell Ames?

12:27.120 --> 12:30.040
I can't have you pair shooting up the
town like it's the Wild West.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.440
Somebody's gonna get hurt.
I nearly got hurt.

12:32.480 --> 12:35.320
Somebody that matters.
He's already tried for you once.

12:35.360 --> 12:38.480
He won't get a second go.
If you know where he is...

12:38.520 --> 12:40.800
It's past that now.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.960
I told you at the start
not to take the law.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.280
There's a reckoning due,
but it's ours to make.

12:45.320 --> 12:48.160
Better get your skates on, then,
hadn't you?

12:48.200 --> 12:52.000
Word is...your nick's going out
of business.

12:52.040 --> 12:54.280
Don't get caught on the wrong side,
Eddie.

12:54.320 --> 12:57.240
You're no good to your boy banged up,
or worse.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.320
Coldwater must be a pricey touch.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.640
You leave Brett out of this.
For now.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.840
Mind how you go.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.800
(CLEARS THROAT)

13:15.040 --> 13:19.720
Is there any news, sir? News?
About Mr Ivory, sir.

13:19.760 --> 13:22.160
The police came, sir.
Talked to all of us, sir.

13:22.200 --> 13:26.360
But they couldn't find him, sir.
And now they're dead, sir.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.560
Who are dead?
The policemen, sir.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.880
A car crash, sir.
With a lorry, sir.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.200
It was in the paper, sir.
Yes, so I hear.

13:33.240 --> 13:36.240
That was bad luck, wasn't it, sir?
Burning to death in a car, sir.

13:36.280 --> 13:39.400
What a way to go, sir. The papers
said it was an accident, sir.

13:39.440 --> 13:41.800
But was it an accident, sir?

13:41.840 --> 13:45.720
Well, there's no reason to believe
otherwise.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.080
Do you think Mr Ivory
had an accident too, sir?

13:49.440 --> 13:51.840
I don't know. What do you think?

13:54.640 --> 13:56.880
Well, you liked him, did you?

13:56.920 --> 13:59.600
Liked him, sir?
He was a master, sir.

13:59.640 --> 14:02.440
We liked Mrs Ivory.
He was married, sir.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.000
Yes, I know.
Are you married, sir?

14:22.440 --> 14:24.920
Mrs Ivory? I'm Mrs Morse.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.720
Shirley. My husband's taken over
the Lower Sixth.

14:27.760 --> 14:31.360
We're in your old house, Rose
Cottage. A letter came for you.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.400
Oh. Thank you.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.560
I'm sure it's the last thing you
need,

14:36.600 --> 14:38.880
but I wondered if you might like to
come to supper.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.760
It's my husband's first school
since we got married,

14:41.800 --> 14:44.600
which makes it my first school
altogether.

14:44.640 --> 14:49.480
I'd be grateful for any advice.
When were you thinking?

14:55.200 --> 14:57.200
Here.

15:02.440 --> 15:03.640
(VAN DOOR SLAMS)

15:03.680 --> 15:05.480
Have you spoken to Mr Bright yet?

15:05.520 --> 15:08.920
He's got a lot on his mind at the
moment, with the station being wound
up.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.280
Well, no better time,
I would have thought.

15:11.320 --> 15:14.400
I know it's a big step...
but it's for the best.

15:15.440 --> 15:18.040
While we still have our health.
I know.

15:18.080 --> 15:21.080
You're not still fretting over Morse?
No.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.240
I've set him on his way.

15:23.960 --> 15:27.440
Good. Got some room for rice pud?
Skin on?

15:27.480 --> 15:29.880
Smashing.

15:29.920 --> 15:33.120
Ooh! Charlie called.
I said you'd call him back.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.560
(DOORBELL) I'll get it!

15:36.480 --> 15:38.680
Jim.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.000
Sorry to drop by late, sir,

15:41.040 --> 15:43.760
but it looks like young George
has got a lead on Ames.

15:47.800 --> 15:51.640
Shirley? What an enchanting name.
(LAUGHTER)

15:51.680 --> 15:56.120
I'm a black belt. 7th dan.
Ex-Territorial.

15:56.160 --> 15:59.000
Feel that. Go on.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
That's rock hard, that is.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.040
It's like granite.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.640
Well, the police came, of course.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.680
Not that I was able to tell them
anything.

16:09.720 --> 16:12.240
I was at home with Ravenna,
my daughter, having supper,

16:12.280 --> 16:14.520
and then we listened to a
concert on the radio.

16:14.560 --> 16:17.480
That's right. Mahler. The Five.

16:17.520 --> 16:20.680
Your wife tells me you were at
Bamfylde? Yes. That's right.

16:20.720 --> 16:23.320
Is Old Wilkie still stinking the
place out with sulphur?

16:23.360 --> 16:25.720
I don't remember him. What about
Popperynge?

16:25.760 --> 16:27.760
Pop, the boys used to call him.

16:27.800 --> 16:31.040
To be honest, I wasn't there long
enough to get to know any of the
masters.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.400
Matron, all well?
Yes, thank you, Headmaster.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.640
Mr Morse, I am sorry to trouble you.

16:35.680 --> 16:37.880
Do you have a moment?
Yes, of course.

16:37.920 --> 16:40.440
Would you excuse me?

16:42.040 --> 16:44.120
(CAR APPROACHING) (TYRES SCREECH)

16:46.120 --> 16:48.120
Armed police! Hands in the air!

Cromwell Ames?
Who wants to know?

16:53.440 --> 16:55.680
DCI Thursday, Thames Valley Police.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.520
Cromwell Ames, you're under arrest
for suspicion of murder.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.040
You do not have to say anything,
but anything you do say

17:01.080 --> 17:04.599
will be taken down
and can be given in evidence.

17:04.640 --> 17:07.319
It's one of the fifth years.
A boy called Stanlow.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.520
Perhaps you could talk to him while
I get fresh linen on the mattress.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.079
He wets the bed.
Ah.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.119
It's Mrs Seymour, isn't it?

17:15.160 --> 17:17.359
We've not been properly introduced.
I'm Morse.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.920
How are you and your wife
finding Coldwater?

17:20.560 --> 17:23.400
I think she'd be happier
if she had a little more to do.

17:24.079 --> 17:26.920
I don't suppose you could use
a spare pair of hands?

17:26.960 --> 17:29.360
I might. Part time.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.720
There wouldn't be much money, but...

17:31.760 --> 17:35.680
if you really think it might be of
interest, tell her to come and see
me.

17:39.080 --> 17:42.560
Liam Flynn. Sometime collector
for Eddie Nero's extortion racket.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.640
Stabbed to death in May.

17:44.680 --> 17:47.280
Burt Hobbs, lorry driver.
Family man.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.320
Just about to celebrate his ruby
wedding.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.480
Had his head bashed in
at Waddington Junction

17:51.520 --> 17:54.040
when a mob hi-jacked
his load of Killoran whisky.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.840
Lloyd Collins, fence for the whisky.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.760
Stabbed to death in a lock-up
in the arse end of Cowley.

17:59.800 --> 18:03.240
A black cockerel was left next to
him. Its head cut off.

18:03.280 --> 18:06.920
Sounds like voodoo to me, mister.

18:08.120 --> 18:12.200
You don't wanna mess with that.
We know what you're about.

18:12.240 --> 18:15.640
You're looking to take over Nero's
turf. Never heard of him.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.920
I'm just a car dealer.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.720
I'm sorry, sir.
I had a nightmare.

18:23.760 --> 18:25.840
I'm all right now.
It's all right.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.400
What's all this?

18:29.440 --> 18:33.400
Mr Ivory said we should look to the
lives of great men as an example,
sir.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.200
Did you like Mr Ivory?
Yes, sir.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.400
Very much, sir.

18:39.440 --> 18:41.960
He wasn't like the other masters.
Oh? How's that?

18:42.000 --> 18:45.440
He was kind.
He used to call me "Dak", sir.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.440
I think it's short for "Daktari".

18:48.480 --> 18:51.400
It's a programme on the television
about a vet in Africa.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.840
There's a lion in it called
Clarence. That's my name too.

18:54.880 --> 18:58.320
I'll get Matron to bring you some
warm milk. Would you like that?

18:58.360 --> 19:00.360
Go on. Hunker down.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.440
Seems a nice boy. Stanlow.

19:09.480 --> 19:12.560
He's troubled, though.
His parents are getting a divorce.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.680
Ah. It's difficult for any child.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.160
To some degree
they always blame themselves.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.720
The other boys bully him.
He's not sporty.

19:19.760 --> 19:22.160
Something of a teacher's pet.
Oh.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.880
Mr Ivory protected him
so far as he could, but...

19:24.920 --> 19:27.800
Why would Mr Ivory protect Stanlow
from the other boys?

19:27.840 --> 19:30.320
I don't know, but he did.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.160

20:31.160 --> 20:34.920
Has Ames said anything?
As little as possible, sir.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.920
His brief is with him now.
A big cheese up from London.

20:37.960 --> 20:40.560
Claiming alibi? A good dozen
witnesses

20:40.600 --> 20:43.600
will swear he was elsewhere at the
time of each of the killings, sir.

20:43.640 --> 20:46.320
All bought and paid for, presumably.

20:46.360 --> 20:49.360
Including the attempt on Nero's life?
In London, sir.

20:49.400 --> 20:54.160
At the...Bunny Club. There's
photographs to prove it.

20:56.520 --> 20:59.320
We've let him go, but I've told
Fancy

20:59.360 --> 21:01.480
not to let him out of his sight.

21:01.520 --> 21:05.120
There might be some progress
with Morse at the school, sir.

21:05.160 --> 21:07.160
The missing persons case.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.520
He's had a shirt left in his desk.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.840
Had a driver pick it up in the early
hours.

21:11.880 --> 21:16.280
Over 20 stab wounds...
according to Dr deBryn.

21:16.320 --> 21:19.800
Murdered, then?
Certainly looks that way, sir.

21:19.840 --> 21:22.680
If it's Ivory's shirt...

21:25.360 --> 21:27.240
Oh, Caesar...
Hence!

Wilt thou lift up Olympus?

21:29.360 --> 21:34.000
Great Caesar...
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?

21:34.040 --> 21:36.560
Speak, hands for me.

21:49.760 --> 21:52.560
Et tu, Brute!

21:52.600 --> 21:55.000
Then fall, Caesar!

22:12.520 --> 22:14.920
It's mostly coughs and colds.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.560
Mumps. Measles. Chickenpox.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.440
But anything serious,
then we get the doctor out.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.720
Otherwise, it's housekeeping.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.800
Are you sure you won't be bored,
Mrs Morse?

22:24.840 --> 22:27.960
Not a bit.
And do call me Shirley, please.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.920
How long have you been at Coldwater?
Ten years now.

22:31.960 --> 22:34.560
Before that I was a district nurse
for eight years.

22:34.600 --> 22:37.440
I'd imagine a matron's
the eyes and ears of a school.

22:37.480 --> 22:40.320
Can't be much that goes on here
you don't know about.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.360
I don't know about that.

22:43.360 --> 22:46.000
What do you think happened
to Mr Ivory?

22:46.040 --> 22:50.680
You don't suppose anyone here
could have...done something?

22:56.520 --> 22:59.760
There was no love lost between Ivory
and Blackwell, apparently.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.080
On the evening in question,
they had words.

23:02.120 --> 23:04.440
Ivory was meant to be
looking after the film show,

23:04.480 --> 23:07.000
but he ended up ducking out
and Blackwell got roped in.

23:07.040 --> 23:08.800
That's hardly motive for murder, is
it?

23:08.840 --> 23:12.440
Mrs Seymour thought there
might be something more to it.

23:12.480 --> 23:15.600
Who do you think left the shirt?
I don't know.

23:15.640 --> 23:18.640
It's either someone trying to help.
Or it's a threat.

23:18.680 --> 23:20.800
(SCHOOL BELL)

23:29.960 --> 23:32.720
What do I remember
about the night Ivory went missing?

23:32.760 --> 23:34.760
(GUNSHOTS)
Funny sort of thing to ask.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.880
No, not really.
Dead man's shoes.

23:36.920 --> 23:40.720
Or dead man's class, in my case.
I'm living in his house.

23:40.760 --> 23:42.760
Well, there's not a lot
I can tell you.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.320
He was meant to run the film for the
boys, but then he said

23:45.360 --> 23:47.760
he had some sort of family emergency
and left me to it.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.720
What did you make of him?
Erm...

23:51.760 --> 23:54.680
He was all right. Now, what's this?

23:54.720 --> 23:58.040
Oh. Stanlow won't fire a rifle.

23:58.080 --> 24:01.360
Will you, Stanlow? Arms up, boy!

24:01.400 --> 24:03.280
Up! (GUNSHOTS CONTINUE)

24:03.320 --> 24:06.480
Yeah. He's got it into his head
he's a little pacifist.

24:06.520 --> 24:08.520
Little coward, more like.

24:08.560 --> 24:10.560
So he's under heavy manners.

24:10.600 --> 24:14.360
See if we can't...correct his
thinking.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.720
Make Britain Greater.

24:16.760 --> 24:19.960
Bloody right. We were a force
to be reckoned with once.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.280
Not now. Going cap in hand with
a begging bowl...

24:25.320 --> 24:28.200
..taking rubbish from half the
places we used to run.

24:28.240 --> 24:31.000
Well, look. I'd best get on.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.600
Give my regards to your wife.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.120
She's a good-looking girl.

24:36.160 --> 24:39.040
How'd you ever manage
to snare a piece like that?

24:40.160 --> 24:42.160
Charm.

24:52.440 --> 24:55.880
How are you finding the boys?
Oh, I think we're still...

24:55.920 --> 24:58.400
getting the measure of each other.

24:58.440 --> 25:00.920
They seem to have held your husband
in some regard.

25:00.960 --> 25:03.400
John was very fond of them.

25:03.440 --> 25:07.120
I don't suppose there's any news from
the police as to what might have
happened?

25:07.160 --> 25:08.440
Morse.
No.

25:08.480 --> 25:11.000
No, it's all right.
I don't mind talking about it.

25:11.040 --> 25:14.000
In a way, it reminds me that it's
real. (KNOCK)

25:14.040 --> 25:16.040
Sorry.

25:17.040 --> 25:21.360
Presumably, the police spoke to
everybody at Coldwater, at the time?

25:21.400 --> 25:24.200
Oh, yes. The usual questions,
I'd imagine.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.600
"Any money troubles?
Did he have any enemies?"

25:26.640 --> 25:29.760
After a week or so,
it just went very quiet.

25:29.800 --> 25:32.000
Right.

Sorry I'm a bit early.
Hello. Hello. Hello, Kate.

25:36.440 --> 25:39.360
How are you? Morse and Shirley have
been spoiling me.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.080
Quite right too.

25:41.120 --> 25:44.120
Early for what? I'm here to lead
your husband astray.

25:44.160 --> 25:47.920
A pint or two at the local.
Well, don't let us stop you.

25:47.960 --> 25:50.800
It was lovely to have met you.
Hopefully we'll see you again.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.960
I'm glad the lower sixth have got
someone nice to look after them.

25:58.320 --> 26:02.240
He seems nice.
Alun? Yes. He's been very kind.

26:02.280 --> 26:04.920
Hm.

Oh, hello, Charlie.
I was gonna ring you.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.760
Everything all right?

26:21.760 --> 26:24.600
Yeah, course. Tonight?

26:26.960 --> 26:29.360
Well, I suppose I can.

26:31.920 --> 26:35.440
Round nine, do you? All right.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.520
Till then.

26:47.080 --> 26:49.600
I mean,
what do you think happened to Ivory?

26:49.640 --> 26:52.840
Oh, Christ. Not him again.
You're like a scratched record, man.

26:52.880 --> 26:56.120
You said you didn't click. How come?

26:57.480 --> 27:00.480
He spoke to the boys' baser
instincts.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.760
Their lesser angels.
Oh.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.160
And he was a bully.

27:06.200 --> 27:09.680
He inspired the same in others.
That's quite a charge.

27:10.680 --> 27:12.680
I taught most of the boys
in your form.

27:12.720 --> 27:15.080
They were all right till Ivory got
hold of them.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.920
Have you ever been bullied?

27:25.240 --> 27:27.240
THURSDAY: Aye-aye, Charlie.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.840
Oh, thanks for coming, Fred.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.520
What's all this?

27:32.560 --> 27:35.080
Well...I don't know where to start.

27:36.560 --> 27:40.160
Well, the beginning's usually
favourite.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.800
Just tell me. What's up?

27:42.840 --> 27:46.480
I got took, Fred.
What do you mean, you got took?

27:46.520 --> 27:49.120
I had to borrow some money.

27:49.160 --> 27:52.160
I thought they were on the level,
to begin with.

27:52.200 --> 27:55.080
I just got more and more behind.

27:55.120 --> 27:57.800
They said I could work it off
through the business.

27:57.840 --> 28:01.800
What do you mean?
Using the company's good standing.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.520
Credit. Goods.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.600
Loans from the bank.

28:06.640 --> 28:09.280
You've been the front
for a long firm fraud.

28:11.120 --> 28:14.280
Oh, Jesus Christ.
What about my money?

28:16.240 --> 28:18.920
Oh, no. No, no, no.

28:18.960 --> 28:21.800
A loan, you said.
A short-term loan, Charlie.

28:21.840 --> 28:24.200
I thought I could buy 'em off.

28:25.360 --> 28:28.000
It's gone, Fred. I'm going away.
We're going away.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.200
Before you get lifted?

28:30.240 --> 28:32.920
What did they do with my money,
Charlie?

28:32.960 --> 28:36.160
The cheque.
Can it be traced back to me?

28:36.200 --> 28:38.200
I...

28:38.240 --> 28:40.880
You've done me, Charlie!

28:40.920 --> 28:43.160
My whole life.
Everything I've worked for.

28:43.200 --> 28:46.040
You've dragged me into the sewer.
I didn't know.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.040
Don't lie to me!

28:49.080 --> 28:51.080
Look. I'm sorry, Fred.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.680
I had to do it for Paulette.
For Carol.

28:53.720 --> 28:56.760
What about me and Win?
It was our retirement.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.960
Our life savings.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.880
Now I've got to live out what I got
left looking over my shoulder,

29:01.920 --> 29:04.240
waiting for the knock?

29:08.360 --> 29:10.360
Fred?

29:11.720 --> 29:13.720
Fred!

29:20.520 --> 29:24.520
Well, the parting of the ways.
Here, you better take this.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.600
Don't you need it?
No.

29:26.640 --> 29:30.400
I'd find my way back blindfolded
after all this time.

29:30.440 --> 29:32.480
Go straight through the woods,

29:32.520 --> 29:35.120
follow the path through
a kissing gate, to the cottage.

29:35.160 --> 29:37.400
Safe home.

29:37.440 --> 29:39.560
Thanks. You too.

29:41.320 --> 29:43.760
He got in their heads, Morse.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.800
Ivory.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.880
You see, cruelty's like cancer.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.880
Starts with one cell.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.320
And if it's left untreated...

29:54.320 --> 29:58.160
..it spreads, till the whole body's
riddled with it.

29:59.480 --> 30:02.720
You've got to cut it out.
You've got to burn it out.

30:04.560 --> 30:06.560
Kill it at the source.

30:18.120 --> 30:21.280
(DOOR CLOSES) Late, Fred.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.160
Work?

30:27.480 --> 30:29.760
No. I had to see Charlie.

30:29.800 --> 30:32.560
In London?

30:32.600 --> 30:34.720
Yeah.

30:35.720 --> 30:37.880
All right, is he?

30:40.080 --> 30:42.080
Fred?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
How much?

31:06.520 --> 31:08.520
Fred?

31:08.560 --> 31:11.880
I'll just have to work a bit longer
than we thought, is all.

31:13.360 --> 31:15.360
You lent Charlie money.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.480
Without telling me?

31:18.520 --> 31:21.800
It was all meant to be paid back by
Christmas.

31:21.840 --> 31:24.160
But it won't be, will it?

32:06.480 --> 32:08.480
(GASPS)

32:25.120 --> 32:27.680
Please send in Mr Morse.
Yes, Headmaster.

32:36.040 --> 32:38.040
Sir.

32:40.920 --> 32:43.360
DCI Thursday. DS Strange.

32:43.400 --> 32:45.840
Thames Valley, CID.

32:45.880 --> 32:49.040
I understand from Mr Mackenzie
it was you who found the body.

32:49.080 --> 32:50.320
That's right.

32:50.360 --> 32:53.240
Why were you wandering round
a graveyard in the dead of night?

32:53.280 --> 32:57.240
It's a short cut from the pub
to Mr Ivory's old cottage.

32:58.960 --> 33:03.120
Right. Well ...I'll need you to come
with me

33:03.160 --> 33:07.160
and explain how it was you came to
stumble across such a thing.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.200
You can spare him for a couple
of hours?

33:09.240 --> 33:11.640
I'll have to get somebody to cover
the Lower Sixth,

33:11.680 --> 33:14.760
but er...yes, of course.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.800
All right, Mr Morse.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.600
All right, then, matey.

33:40.640 --> 33:43.280
Should've known if anyone
was gonna find him, it'd be you.

33:43.320 --> 33:45.400
Except I haven't.
It's not Ivory.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.400
I couldn't say, when I called it in,
because I was on a public line.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.320
But it's a boy called Rowntree.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.880
He was expelled
shortly before Ivory went missing.

33:52.920 --> 33:56.360
There's a letter to his parents from
the headmaster in his blazer pocket.

34:00.600 --> 34:03.240
Gentlemen.
Doctor.

34:05.320 --> 34:07.600
What have we got?

34:07.640 --> 34:11.560
Male. 13 to 18 years of age.

34:12.800 --> 34:15.600
Decomposition suggests
a time of decease

34:15.639 --> 34:18.560
approximately four to six weeks ago.

34:18.600 --> 34:22.199
Cause, Doc? No obvious signs
of foul play.

34:22.239 --> 34:25.920
But I think we might assume
he didn't put himself in the coffin.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.040
Ivory's clearly been here. And more
than once by the look of things.

34:30.080 --> 34:33.960
He had a pupil fetch him 40
Fusiliers and a bottle of Scotch
from the village most days.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.600
Meeting someone up here, you think?
Who? Local tart or somebody?

34:38.639 --> 34:41.360
Rowntree maybe? Looks like
he was setting up a rendezvous.

34:41.400 --> 34:44.239
"6.30 UP". Usual Place?
Perhaps from Ivory?

34:44.280 --> 34:46.880
All of the teachers
mark the homework in red ink here.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.920
What put you onto it?
The door was open.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.960
But it was also something Trewlove
said.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.040
The night that Ivory disappeared,
he said to the landlord at the pub

34:55.080 --> 34:58.480
that he was meeting an Agnes Davis.
Agnes? Older bird, maybe?

34:58.520 --> 35:02.320
No. It wasn't Agnes Davis. The
landlord misheard him. It was Agnus
Dei.

35:04.080 --> 35:07.920
Lamb of God. Ivory was partial to a
Latin joke.

35:07.960 --> 35:11.920
So...now we've got a dead boy,
and Ivory's still missing.

35:11.960 --> 35:15.200
Poor show from the locals
that they didn't turn up Rowntree.

35:15.240 --> 35:18.400
Maybe they did.
No mention of it in the case file.

35:18.440 --> 35:20.560
Perhaps there would have been had
they lived.

35:20.600 --> 35:22.720
What are you saying?
It wasn't an accident?

35:22.760 --> 35:26.760
When was the last time you heard of
two police officers dying in the
middle of an inquiry?

35:35.760 --> 35:38.240
Is it true?

35:38.280 --> 35:40.920
We were together all evening.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.960
What's this I hear about Cowley?

35:47.000 --> 35:49.920
Do you know where you'll be?
No. We're expecting letters.

35:49.960 --> 35:52.520
In Oxford, though, still?

35:52.560 --> 35:54.640
Place wouldn't be the same.

35:54.680 --> 35:58.000
Any more on Ivory's shirt?
23 separate stab wounds.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.480
Any one of a dozen
could have been fatal,

36:00.520 --> 36:03.080
depending on the depth
of penetration of the blade.

36:03.120 --> 36:05.240
But it was his blood group?
Oh, yes.

36:05.280 --> 36:09.760
And made to his measurements by a
bespoke shirt-maker on Jermyn
Street.

36:10.760 --> 36:14.040
You've no idea who left it in your
desk? No. Nor why.

36:14.080 --> 36:16.560
Well, I'm sure you'll get to the
bottom of it.

36:17.560 --> 36:20.960
Furthers and betters on the boy
once I've had a rummage.

36:23.320 --> 36:25.680
How long's all this going on for,
then? Hm?

36:25.720 --> 36:29.640
You, out here with Shirley.
Until we find Ivory. Why?

36:30.880 --> 36:33.200
Just remember what's what,
that's all.

36:33.240 --> 36:35.240
"What's what"? What does that mean?

36:36.560 --> 36:38.560
You know what it means.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.400
Oh, grow up.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.960
You know, if you put as much effort
into your police work

36:43.000 --> 36:45.600
as you do into your love life,
you might get somewhere.

36:49.320 --> 36:51.880
Rowntree?
But that's impossible.

36:51.920 --> 36:55.240
We found a letter to his parents,
signed by you, in his blazer.

36:55.280 --> 36:58.000
Why was he expelled?

36:58.040 --> 37:00.160
He was a troublemaker.

37:02.640 --> 37:05.960
He wasn't a bad kid. Bit lippy.

37:06.000 --> 37:10.960
But sooner that than some "Yes, sir.
No, sir," little automated,

37:11.000 --> 37:14.600
"I'd happily watch you die in a
fire, sir." But what happened?

37:16.120 --> 37:18.120
Well, he was Stanlow Mark I.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.320
Thick as thieves with Ivory
for a bit.

37:20.360 --> 37:25.080
Ivory shielded him from
the worst of Blackwell's attention.

37:25.120 --> 37:28.760
And then, I don't know, about a week
or so before Ivory lit out,

37:28.800 --> 37:31.200
they had some sort of an argument,
and erm...

37:31.240 --> 37:34.680
Well, Rowntree hit him.

37:34.720 --> 37:38.440
Hit Ivory? That's what he said.

37:38.480 --> 37:40.920
I mean, that's immediate expulsion.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.800
Headmaster sent Rowntree home
with a letter for his parents,

37:44.840 --> 37:48.520
and Ivory drove him to the station.

37:48.560 --> 37:51.320
And that was that.
That was the last we saw of him.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.480
As you were, Nero.

37:59.960 --> 38:02.640
What's this? Suetonius?
Yes, sir.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.720
That's not on the curriculum, is it?
No, sir.

38:04.760 --> 38:07.720
Pinched it from the infirmary,
for pleasure, sir.

38:07.760 --> 38:09.960
Is it Mr Ivory, sir?

38:10.000 --> 38:12.280
Out in the cemetery.
No.

38:12.320 --> 38:14.960
It would appear to be this boy
Rowntree.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Rowntree?
Mm.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.120
How? What happened?

38:20.160 --> 38:22.720
Well, I don't know. (SCHOOL BELL)

38:24.880 --> 38:27.560
Is there anything you'd like to tell
me?

38:27.600 --> 38:29.920
I'm not a grass, sir.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.600
Can I go, sir?

38:36.240 --> 38:38.440
Yes. You can go.

39:03.200 --> 39:05.360
It's all right. Don't panic.

39:05.400 --> 39:09.160
I'm not about to "blow your cover",
or whatever the jargon is.

39:09.200 --> 39:11.400
Door to door.
That's fine.

39:11.440 --> 39:14.800
Except we weren't living here when
Ivory or this boy were last seen.

39:14.840 --> 39:16.880
I didn't know that, did I?

39:18.000 --> 39:21.400
You OK? I miss you.

39:21.440 --> 39:23.520
It's only been four days.

39:24.560 --> 39:26.920
Yeah, all right. Feels longer.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.840
Do you miss me?

39:32.040 --> 39:34.040
Look, you'd best push off.

39:35.640 --> 39:38.320
(SIGHS) All right. All right.

39:43.560 --> 39:45.560
I love you, Shirl.

39:58.720 --> 40:00.720
Rowntree was a sensitive boy.

40:02.120 --> 40:04.880
A weakling, I suppose you'd call it.

40:04.920 --> 40:08.000
That's certainly what Mr Blackwell
called him. He...

40:08.040 --> 40:10.080
He what, Mrs Seymour?

40:12.840 --> 40:15.040
He made him run around the field
in full cadet kit

40:15.080 --> 40:17.720
until he collapsed from exhaustion.

40:21.840 --> 40:24.960
I wouldn't trust a word
out of Matron's mouth.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.600
She doesn't like me. Never has.
It's not her word, though, is it?

40:28.640 --> 40:31.000
It's here in the infirmary book,
in black and white.

40:31.040 --> 40:35.200
You laid into Rowntree so hard
he was passing blood for three days.

40:35.240 --> 40:39.320
What did you think you were doing?
Making men. Real men.

40:39.360 --> 40:42.080
Not lily-livered sissies.

40:42.120 --> 40:45.400
Waterloo was won on the playing
fields of places like Coldwater.

40:45.440 --> 40:48.040
That's the problem with this country
today.

40:48.080 --> 40:50.640
It's too soft by half. Flogging?

40:50.680 --> 40:54.680
Corporal punishment.
It never did me any harm.

40:59.120 --> 41:02.800
Bastards! Talking to a man like
that! How dare they!

41:02.840 --> 41:04.720
Did that not go well, then?

41:04.760 --> 41:08.200
You know, one day someone is gonna
shut that smart mouth of yours.

41:10.560 --> 41:12.960
What the hell are you looking at,
boy?

41:13.000 --> 41:15.080
I've got a sick note, sir,
from Matron.

41:15.120 --> 41:17.120
I'm excused games.

41:21.960 --> 41:24.760
You are excused nothing,
you little weakling.

41:24.800 --> 41:27.840
Steady. On your way, Stanlow.

41:37.600 --> 41:41.200
It doesn't look good for Ivory.
Last man to see the boy alive.

41:41.240 --> 41:45.080
So far as we know. Or maybe somebody
here did for them both.

41:45.120 --> 41:49.040
Possibly. But the "why" of it,
that's where I'm coming up short.

41:49.080 --> 41:51.440
Well, whatever's behind it,
watch your step.

41:51.480 --> 41:54.000
We've already got two dead coppers.
Thanks.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.320
Thank you, Mr Morse.
You've been very helpful.

41:57.360 --> 42:00.200
We may need to speak to you again.
Headmaster.

42:22.640 --> 42:24.760
(BELT HITS HARD) BOYS: Nine.

42:27.280 --> 42:29.520
(BELT HITS AGAIN) Ten.

42:31.520 --> 42:33.520
11.

42:35.200 --> 42:37.560
12.

42:37.600 --> 42:39.640
Leave him alone!

42:46.160 --> 42:48.160
What did you say?

42:49.800 --> 42:51.920
He's had enough...sir.

42:53.920 --> 42:58.120
Please...just...leave him alone.

43:03.560 --> 43:05.560
Why don't you make me?

43:05.600 --> 43:08.000
Huh? Huh?

43:09.920 --> 43:11.920
Tough nut?

43:14.800 --> 43:17.680
We all know whose son you are.

43:17.720 --> 43:23.160
So why don't you show us all
what you're made of?

43:31.120 --> 43:33.120
No, no...

43:41.680 --> 43:43.840
Sir! You'd better come quick!

43:43.880 --> 43:46.200
What is it, boy?
It's Mr Blackwell, sir.

43:46.240 --> 43:48.480
No!
Where you going, huh? Come on!

43:48.520 --> 43:53.040
What are you gonna do? Come on!
What is the meaning of this?

43:53.080 --> 43:54.520
(Panting)

43:56.800 --> 44:01.080
Nero was trying to interfere with me
in the execution of my duty.

44:01.120 --> 44:03.720
Matron, you and Mr Morse
can see to Stanlow and Nero.

44:03.760 --> 44:05.520
I'm all right, sir.

44:05.560 --> 44:08.960
Then Mr Bodnar will take you back to
the dormitory with the rest of the
boys.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.360
Mr Blackwell, I'll see you in my
study.

44:11.400 --> 44:13.520
It's all right. I've got him.

44:20.560 --> 44:22.640
You're very good, aren't you?

44:23.800 --> 44:28.080
Sorry?
See, I spoke to old Wilkie.

44:28.120 --> 44:31.720
He doesn't remember a master
called Morse at Bamfylde.

44:33.760 --> 44:35.960
So what's your story? Hm?

44:37.320 --> 44:41.360
Who are you? You can tell me
or the head teacher can.

44:41.400 --> 44:43.520
I'm with the Education Board.

44:43.560 --> 44:46.520
You should keep that to yourself
if you value your position.

44:46.560 --> 44:49.280
There have been some concerns
about Coldwater. Ah.

44:49.320 --> 44:51.840
It's called character building.

44:53.080 --> 44:56.240
Toughen them up.
Make them ready for the world.

44:56.280 --> 45:00.160
The boys know that. It's Ivory who
messed with their heads.

45:00.200 --> 45:02.880
If you want to know
what happened to Rowntree...

45:02.920 --> 45:04.920
you find Ivory.

They say that when you die, your
whole life flashes before your eyes.

45:53.280 --> 45:56.560
Do you think that's true?
It's a pretty grim topic

45:56.600 --> 45:58.600
for somebody painting their
toenails.

45:58.640 --> 46:01.320
What are girls supposed to talk
about, Morse?

46:01.360 --> 46:05.280
Ponies? Kittens? Boys?

46:07.120 --> 46:13.040
I saw your boy this afternoon.
Oh, Lord.

46:13.080 --> 46:15.320
I told him not to get too serious.

46:16.720 --> 46:18.800
I thought you liked him.

46:18.840 --> 46:23.840
With the station closing down, I've
put in for a transfer, to the Yard.

46:26.240 --> 46:28.280
Have you told him?

46:29.080 --> 46:33.680
It won't change anything. We'll still
be able to see each other.

46:33.720 --> 46:37.240
But we're young.
We have to put career first now.

46:37.280 --> 46:40.920
Haven't we? Oh, a...career won't...

46:40.960 --> 46:44.400
hold you at 3:00 in the morning when
the wolves come circling.

46:46.680 --> 46:48.760
Do they come circling, Morse?

46:55.880 --> 46:57.880
I think I should make my bath.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.080
If I found someone...

47:11.800 --> 47:14.200
..then all of this
wouldn't matter at all.

47:33.480 --> 47:36.600

I'm just erm...clocking off, sir.

at an all-night drinker.

47:39.960 --> 47:43.160

I'll be back on first thing.

47:43.200 --> 47:45.040
Right.

47:45.080 --> 47:47.080
Wait a minute.

47:49.000 --> 47:53.240
This...undercover case.

47:53.280 --> 47:55.680
You've nothing to worry about.

47:55.720 --> 47:58.680
I'm not daft. I've got eyes.

47:58.720 --> 48:01.360
Morse is as decent as they come.

48:01.400 --> 48:03.480
Trewlove's got her head screwed on.

48:03.520 --> 48:07.280
All this with Ames and Nero,
I need your mind on the job. Right?

48:07.320 --> 48:09.360
Not fretting over nothing.

48:09.400 --> 48:11.440
You can count on me, sir.
I won't let you down.

48:11.480 --> 48:13.840
I know. Goodnight, sir. Night.

48:26.840 --> 48:29.680

27 years I've stood by you,

50:03.080 --> 50:06.840
for better or worse,
and you do this?

50:06.880 --> 50:10.320
It was our future. It was family.

50:10.360 --> 50:14.080
And what am I?
You didn't even tell me.

50:14.120 --> 50:17.840
I was trying to protect you.
Protect yourself, more like.

50:17.880 --> 50:20.680
I may not say much,
but I am not stupid.

50:20.720 --> 50:23.360

here who's got secrets.

(TAXI DRIVES AWAY)

51:00.640 --> 51:04.280
The boys have got double chemistry
with Bodnar, so I'm gonna head into
town,

51:04.320 --> 51:06.720
see if there's any more on
this Rowntree post mortem.

51:06.760 --> 51:09.520
Will you be all right?
I can take care of myself.

51:09.560 --> 51:12.560
Yes, I'm sure, but odds are we've
still got a killer

51:12.600 --> 51:16.360
on the grounds somewhere. All right.

51:25.720 --> 51:30.280
It's Mrs Morse, isn't it?
Shouldn't you be in form?

51:30.320 --> 51:32.800
It's a free period.
Double.

51:32.840 --> 51:35.280
Bunking off to the cemetery
for a smoke, is that it?

51:35.320 --> 51:38.760
Join us if you like. I don't think
my husband would approve.

51:38.800 --> 51:42.320
He's not here, though...is he?

51:42.360 --> 51:44.640
I thought it was off limits to boys.

51:44.680 --> 51:46.880
We're not boys, Mrs Morse.

51:46.920 --> 51:48.920
We're Praetorians.

51:48.960 --> 51:52.120
And a graveyard pass is Praetorians'
Privilege. Oh, I see.

51:53.120 --> 51:55.680
Why don't you come with us?
No, thank you.

51:55.720 --> 51:59.080
Perhaps you don't trust yourself,
Mrs Morse. I beg your pardon?

51:59.120 --> 52:02.480
With three strapping Praetorians.

52:02.520 --> 52:04.600
You're stoned.
Your eyes have gone.

52:04.640 --> 52:07.040
Be on your way before you get in
serious trouble.

52:07.080 --> 52:09.240
You could be the one in trouble,
Mrs Morse.

52:09.280 --> 52:13.200
These woods aren't safe. No-one to
hear you scream.

52:13.240 --> 52:15.600
No-one heard Rowntree, did they?

52:16.680 --> 52:21.480
On your way, Clunchfist. Mr Bodnar.
That's a month's privs.

52:21.520 --> 52:23.720
What are you doing
out in the woods, sir?

52:23.760 --> 52:26.640
Or shouldn't we ask?
You too, Rackway.

52:26.680 --> 52:30.520
The gatehouse lodge is that way,
sir. If you're lost.

52:30.560 --> 52:33.080
And, Mr Queach,
that's all three of you.

52:33.120 --> 52:36.400
You shouldn't threaten us, sir.

52:36.440 --> 52:40.400
What? Qui non nobiscum adversus nos
est, sir.

52:42.000 --> 52:46.400

before I fetch the Headmaster.

52:58.120 --> 53:00.560
You all right? Thanks.

53:00.600 --> 53:03.360
It's a good job you came by.
I'll walk you back.

53:12.120 --> 53:15.000
I'm still awaiting results
on the boy's blood,

53:15.040 --> 53:19.480
but examination of residue
found in the nasal cavity and sinuses

53:19.520 --> 53:22.280
suggests he had...snorted heroin.

53:22.320 --> 53:24.360
Snorted heroin?

53:24.400 --> 53:27.000
Almost 100% purity.

53:27.040 --> 53:29.280
Very likely stopped his heart.

53:29.320 --> 53:31.960
Where the hell did he come by that?

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
There's something wrong with Ivory's
story

53:34.040 --> 53:36.320
that he drove Rowntree to the
station.

53:36.360 --> 53:39.160
Why would he take him, if they'd had
a physical altercation?

53:39.200 --> 53:41.440
So, you saying he didn't
take the boy?

53:41.480 --> 53:45.520
Then somebody else must've seen him.
No. The reports are all second hand.

53:45.560 --> 53:48.400
All we've got to go on
is what Ivory told people.

53:48.440 --> 53:51.520
Well, why would he say
he'd taken him if he hadn't?

54:13.880 --> 54:16.000
The boy can't have known
what he was doing?

54:16.040 --> 54:19.400
Snorting that amount of pure heroin
is tantamount to suicide.

54:19.440 --> 54:21.640
Sir? Hm?

54:21.680 --> 54:23.960
Everything all right?
Ah, Thursday.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.280
Anything from the post mortem?

54:26.320 --> 54:29.040
It's drugs, sir, with the boy.
Heroin.

54:29.080 --> 54:31.960
Heroin? Good Lord.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Anything further on Ivory?

54:34.040 --> 54:36.960
You've no idea who left that shirt
in your desk? No, sir,

54:37.000 --> 54:40.120
but something about the number of
stab wounds rings a bell somewhere.

54:40.160 --> 54:43.120
23, to be precise,
according to Dr deBryn.

54:43.160 --> 54:46.040
Is the number important?
A frenzied attack, surely.

54:46.080 --> 54:49.160
Yeah, all right, matey.
Stand to. We're on our way.

54:49.200 --> 54:52.160
George says Ames has just pulled up
outside Nero's snooker hall,

54:52.200 --> 54:55.320
mob-handed and carrying. Could be
another attempt on Nero.

What wasn't you?

Oh, no. Ambulance! Here!

George? George, can you hear me?

57:23.200 --> 57:25.480
What's he doing here?
George!

57:25.520 --> 57:28.280
I told him to stand to.

57:28.320 --> 57:31.600
Come on! George, come on!

57:31.640 --> 57:33.640
Leave him, Morse.

Is it true?

58:05.080 --> 58:07.240
Who?

58:09.560 --> 58:12.880
A statement will be made.
Off the record.

58:17.840 --> 58:19.840
I can't.

58:25.480 --> 58:27.480
Just get his age right.

58:29.560 --> 58:31.560
He was 23.

58:40.920 --> 58:43.680
Bloody mess, this is.
All right, Sergeant.

58:50.320 --> 58:53.720
Seems to have got caught
in the crossfire, sir.

58:53.760 --> 58:57.200
What was he doing here?
Tailing Cromwell Ames.

58:57.240 --> 59:00.360
Some sort of pow-wow gone wrong,
would you imagine?

59:00.400 --> 59:04.560
Takeover bid, sir. I think that's
what Ames came here for.

59:05.560 --> 59:10.360
Gentlemen. I'll start with George
if I may.

59:10.400 --> 59:12.720
We don't want him lying in such
company

59:12.760 --> 59:15.640
a moment longer than he has to.

59:51.160 --> 59:55.080
Have his people been notified?

All the driver would say was I had
to come back to the station.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.320
Morse?

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.800
No.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:40.920
Not much of a haul
to lose one's life over.

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:43.120
Maybe Ames was expecting more.

Ivory was involved with Nero?

The two local CID
that died in the car crash.

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.360
Was that Nero? Maybe they were
getting too close

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.840
to any drugs business
between him and Ivory.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:09.800
So, hang on...
Division sent us undercover...

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.360
..with only half the story, and
knowing that somehow

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.520
Nero was involved. So they put us
all at risk.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:19.000
I didn't know. We should bloody know.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.040
If Division had put their cards on
the table,

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:24.400
I might have played things
differently, and George could still
be alive.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:28.200
There's nothing we can do now.
Everybody involved in the wretched
business is dead.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.480
Go home. Get some rest.

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.120
That's an order.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.440
THURSDAY: Hell of a thing.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.200
It took guts to go in
after Cromwell Ames.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:03.440
What was he hoping for?
Arrest them all?

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.880
Whatever he was hoping for,
it doesn't much matter now.

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:10.080
You'll give him respect.
He's due that.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.480
He was due another 50 years.

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.000
A wife. Kids, maybe.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.760
Do you still love this place?

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.320
I should get back to the school.
It'll keep, won't it?

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.000
Today at least. No, it won't.

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.320
How are you?

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.480

I've got to clean them.

about Rowntree and Mr Ivory?

Like what, sir?
Anything.

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.080
Why did Rowntree hit him?

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.120

Oh, he's left, sir.

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:47.120

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.600
Very good. Thank you.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.840
Right...

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.360
Is everything all right, sir?

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.400
Is this some kind of a joke?

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.720
Joke, sir?

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:15.680
First the shirt,
and now this in my desk.

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:18.120
Mr Ivory's desk, sir.
It's no joke, sir.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.560
It's serious, sir.
It's deadly serious, sir.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.040
Oh, what?
Some kind of a threat, is it?

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.560
I'm to believe that one of you
have killed Mr Ivory?

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.600
I'm supposed to be afraid?
Is that it?

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:31.360
Well, I'm not.
Are you sure about that, sir?

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.400
Quite sure.
Where did you find it?

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.960
We couldn't tell you, sir.
We didn't put it there, sir.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.560
Are you quite well, sir? Perhaps
you should get some air, sir?

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.840
All all right?
Tough morning at the chalk face?

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:50.360
Well, you know. Oh. My wife said she
saw you

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:53.040
in the woods with some of the boys.
Ah, yes.

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.720
She was under the impression
some of them were high.

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.560
Is there much of that here? Dope?

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.800
Well, Ivory used to go on holiday
to Marrakech every summer.

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.040
I think he used to bring
a bit back with him.

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.200
What? He sold it to the boys?

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:11.280
He's got to underwrite his losses
on the gee-gees somehow.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.520
I thought you were up in school.
Ivory's wallet. Left in my desk.

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.720
Who by?
We'll have it fingerprinted,

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.640
but one of the boys would be my
guess. Think they killed him?

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:43.960
It's what they want me to believe.
There's no evidence for that.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.120
No, but there were 23 stab wounds.

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:48.520
According to Suetonius,
the Roman historian,

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:51.600
Julius Caesar was stabbed 23 times
by the conspirators.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.720
The boys are studying that
as a school play.

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.080
Coincidence?
Maybe.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:58.360
In any event, there's a business
card for Magdalen Cabs in here.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.400
He was in it with Nero, then.
No doubt.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:04.240
According to one of the teachers,
Ivory had been selling hashish to the
boys.

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:06.440
How'd he come by it?
He travelled every summer.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:09.840
The Roman coast of North Africa.
Marrakesh. Tangier. Then Istanbul.

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:12.080
Where he's made a connection
to the heroin?

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.880

schoolmaster in England?

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:18.640

might have a moment. Sir.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.520
I've been going over ballistics.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.560
I took three bullets
out of George Fancy.

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:42.040
Not one of them matched any of the
weapons recovered at the crime
scene.

Yes. Yes, of course.
By all means. Come in.

So what's all this about?

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.120
Well, ballistics prove
that Fancy was shot

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:13.720
by someone who got away
from the snooker hall, sir.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:15.800
His killer's still at large.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:30.319
Presumably that will all be...
passed to the investigating officer.

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:32.800
Well, he was our colleague, sir.

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:37.880

that you were off mostly.

Thought you might go an early tea.

on the off chance?

Well, there's nothing in.
I've not been bothering.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.960
You know you can be expelled
for that.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
My father sits on the Board of
Governors.

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:06.840
He won't sit there long if it comes
out you've been using drugs on school
property.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:09.760
He doesn't give a shit about me
or anything I do.

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:12.960
Maybe not. But I'm sure he cares
about his own reputation.

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:21.520
I've given the wallet to the police.
They already have the shirt.

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.840
I'm sure they'll want to interview
you.

murder, that's life.

the shirt and the wallet?

Yeah. The police will be taking
prints off them.

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:57.880
It wasn't like that.
We just found them.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.320
Where? Where did you find them?

I don't know,

of it.

Sir.

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:18.600
I've seen that equation before
on his rough book.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:21.040
Isn't that the Rifleman's rule?

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:24.240
The calculation which enables
accurate firing, uphill or downhill.

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:28.560
And that's Coldwater, isn't it?

to study the lives of great men.

a different lesson altogether?

I need to ask you about Mr Ivory.

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.560
The nickname he gave you, Dak.

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:24.080
It wasn't for Daktari, was it?

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:30.320
We've just come from seeing Stanlow.

How is he? Giving up his secrets.

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:38.440
Seems...Ivory had a nickname for
him. Called him Dak.

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:42.280
Turns out it's a Hindi word
meaning "post" or "mail".

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:46.320
In the days of the Raj,
the dak runner

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:49.240
brought letters from the plains
to the hill stations.

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:52.000
Kipling celebrated it
in a poem called The Overland Mail.

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.920
Ivory was big on Kipling.

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:58.000
Is that right? Mm. Ivory called
Stanlow Dak

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:00.440
because the boy ran errands for him.

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:03.560
Like Rowntree before him, he picked
up his whisky and cigarettes

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:06.320
from the village shop. But he also
delivered letters

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:09.080
between Ivory and the Headmaster's
daughter.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:12.200
Ivory was cheating on his wife
with Ravenna.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:17.080
But you knew all this,
as your admissions book confirms.

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:21.840
The day Ivory disappeared, Stanlow
was taken with a sudden fever.

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:25.040
He was here and couldn't deliver
the message from Ravenna to Ivory.

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.680
So he sent you instead.

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:30.880
Who was it you followed
to their usual meeting place

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:34.480
at the kissing gate?
My guess would be Ravenna.

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:37.520
Too risky to tail Ivory
from the pub.

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:40.720
So you waited till they were done.

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.880
Ravenna came back to the school.

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:46.320
Ivory went back, through the only
route he could, to Rose Cottage.

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:48.720
And that was your chance.

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:15.200
Filling the boys' heads with evil,
hatred, cruelty.

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.600
They're just children.
Drugs, for God's sake!

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:22.120
They thought they were so grown up,
but they didn't have a clue.

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.200
What put you on to it?

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:29.680
I was a nurse, don't forget.
I know what an overdose looks like.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.960
Rowntree?
He came to the infirmary.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.600
He was white as a sheet, sweating...

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:37.640
heart going ten to the dozen,

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:40.560
and he thought he was going to die.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:43.480
So Ivory was using Rowntree
as the main supply channel

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.520
for drugs to the boys?

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.560
Until he became a liability.

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:49.640
Or got too big for his boots, maybe.

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:52.160
Whatever the case,
Ivory got him expelled,

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:54.320
and then he started in on Stanlow...

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:58.240
..and I couldn't let that happen
again. I...

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:01.760
I had to protect them.
I had to protect them all.

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:07.400
Where is Ivory, Mrs Seymour?

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:16.560
Where he belongs.

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.560
(FLIES BUZZING)

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:30.080
THURSDAY: Doctor. Septic tank.

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.680
What a treat.

01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:36.400
Better start going through the
motions.

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:42.640
Do you think Ivory did kill
Rowntree?

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:46.720
Maybe the boy got it into his head
to try a bit of private enterprise.

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:49.080
Could it be that's what they fought
over?

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.920
Might just as well have been
accidental.

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:54.800
If the kid didn't know
what he'd been taking...

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:58.520
maybe he mistook one thing for
another. Who knows?

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.560
Perhaps Ivory finds him
at the cemetery,

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.240
already overdosed on heroin
meant for Eddie Nero.

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:05.840
He hides the body,
then comes up with a story

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:08.200
of having dropped him at the
station.

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:45.360
A policeman?
Well, Blackwell was right, then.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:48.200
You were never a teacher.
I should have known.

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:51.880
How's that? You didn't look beaten
enough.

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:05.880
Happiest days of your life?
Not much happiness here.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:23.520
I'd hoped to see you as the first
female officer in Cowley CID.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:26.160
But our loss will be the Yard's gain.

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.680
You'll do great things there,
I'm sure. Great things.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:33.160
Thank you, sir.

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.520
We shall all miss you.

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.680
I don't suppose there's anything
one can say...

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:45.760
I'm so frightfully sorry.

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.600
Good luck, Constable.

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:55.040
Thank you for always looking out
for me.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:58.960
It has been...a privilege.

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:08.280
I didn't know if you'd be in.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.720
I just...came to say goodbye.

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:15.680
Well, I'll see you at the funeral.

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:18.280
The boy I liked is dead.

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:20.760
I'm not gonna sit and look at a box.

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:29.760
Life is for the living, Morse.

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:31.880
Don't waste time.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.920
It's all we've got.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.480
I'm no good at goodbyes.

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:46.640
Well, then, let's not say it.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:02.400
MORSE: Say not the struggle nought
availeth

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:04.960
the labour and the wounds are vain.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.920
The enemy faints not, nor faileth,

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:11.360
and as things have been, they remain.

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:16.000
If hopes were dupes,
fears may be liars.

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:19.480
It may be, in yon smoke concealed,

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:23.040
your comrades chase
even now the fliers.

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:26.080
And, but for you, possess the field.

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:31.040
For while the tired waves,
vainly breaking,

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:35.320
seem here no painful inch to gain.

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:39.560
Far back through creeks
and inlets making,

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:43.000
come silent, flooding in, the main.

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:47.120
And not by eastern windows only

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:50.440
when daylight comes,
comes in the light.

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:55.120
In front the sun climbs slow,
how slowly.

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:58.640
But westward, look,
the land is bright.

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.280
At least we gave him a good
send-off.

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:09.200
We can say that.
Yes.

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:13.000
We can say that.

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:16.760
Nicely done, Morse. Your poem.

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:19.600
Gentlemen. Miss Frazil.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:24.200
Would that you'd never
had to write such a thing,

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:28.000
but it was a very fine obituary.

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:30.600
He seemed a decent young man.

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:35.040
No platitude knowingly unexpressed.

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.760
It's what we say, Morse,
when we don't know what to say.

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:40.800
But we do know what to say.
We just can't stomach saying it.

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:44.200
What we want to say is,
"Thank Christ it wasn't me."

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.800
That's the last of it, is it?

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.840
Yes, sir.

01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:24.160
Well...

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:28.080
When I arrived here three years ago,
I had such high hopes.

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:31.040
What an ignominious end
I have led you all to.

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:33.120
I shall resign, of course.
Sir...

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:36.720
No, I failed him.
I failed my men.

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:39.080
The station gone.

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.920
My brightest and best
cast to the four winds,

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:44.280
and all is...

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:47.520
(SIGHS) ..brought to ruin.

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:52.040
Bollocks to that. I won't hear it.

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:55.360
We might be down, but we're not out.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:57.800
I'll be damned if this is how it
ends.

01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.840
We'll have justice for him, sir.

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:04.200
Find who shot that bullet.
Whatever it takes. Jim's right, sir.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.920
They can call us Thames Valley
till the cows come home,

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:12.800
but wherever we wash up,
we're city men, each one of us.

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:16.520
To our boots. To the last. So few.

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.320
Enough to give him justice.
We'll find the bastard, sir.

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:22.080
Your word on it.
My oath.

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:24.560
And mine. For George.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.320
That's that. Well, good luck on
Monday.

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.240
Any news on your posting?
No. No, not yet.

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.360
What happened to the Winchester
over the fireplace?

01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:58.400
Turning in your tin star?

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:02.480
How did Mrs Thursday take it?

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.280
She married a copper.

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:09.320
Things happen.

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.600
Didn't seem the time.

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:16.880
With Fancy.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.640
I should've given him more time.

01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:23.560
You gave him what you could.
He knew that.

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.120
I could've been kinder.

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:28.200
Who couldn't?

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.760
Right...

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:42.480
I thought handshakes
were for goodbye.

01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.960
Hello.

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:01.960
I just came round.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
I can see.

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:07.720
I just thought...

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:12.760
..maybe if that offer of a coffee's
still going?
