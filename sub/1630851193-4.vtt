10:42.163 --> 10:44.948
We're going to hang over
at the Parkers' again today.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.647
I don't know, man.
I got to catch up on, like,

10:47.690 --> 10:49.997
all the homework
I've ever been assigned.

10:50.040 --> 10:53.565
And I got to help her.
You know how Ollie is.

10:53.609 --> 10:56.699
Okay, but I want
to see the work.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.309
And... send.

10:58.353 --> 11:01.225
Okay, look, my text implies,
very subtly,

11:01.269 --> 11:03.488
in an insinuating way, that

11:03.532 --> 11:06.274
this time it should be just
a chill one-on-one,

11:06.317 --> 11:08.189
fam-on-fam hang.

11:09.538 --> 11:12.454
-What? What is this?
-Oh, trust me.

11:12.497 --> 11:14.717
[kids shouting, laughing]

11:14.761 --> 11:17.067
[indistinct chatter]

11:18.808 --> 11:23.204
Man, it is so great
to hang with you two.

11:23.247 --> 11:26.163
And everyone you ever met.
Yeah, it's fun.

11:26.207 --> 11:28.731
We just go with
the flow, you know.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.864
So what do you do for work?

11:30.907 --> 11:33.040
I don't care, I'm whatever. You?

11:33.083 --> 11:34.432
Oh, same.

11:34.476 --> 11:36.565
[gulping]

11:38.785 --> 11:42.136
That's the area everyone
realized I was a genius.

11:42.179 --> 11:44.355
-[all cheering]
-Yeah, Todd!

11:44.399 --> 11:46.488
[whoops] You are the man.

11:46.531 --> 11:48.882
That's the fridge
that held my 105%

11:48.925 --> 11:50.535
geography assignment.

11:50.579 --> 11:54.365
-And...
-That's the stuff you're
completely exaggerating.

11:54.409 --> 11:55.932
What are you doing here, Ollie?

11:55.976 --> 11:58.413
I'm here to steal all the
copper piping out of this home.

11:58.456 --> 12:02.504
-To sell them?
-To press them
into pennies, dummy.

12:02.547 --> 12:03.940
[straining]

12:03.984 --> 12:07.161
So why are you here acting like
Dr. Manhattan,

12:07.204 --> 12:10.033
exaggerating and fabricating
shit that never happened?

12:10.077 --> 12:13.297
Sad about becoming poor,
huh? [grunts]

12:13.341 --> 12:16.387
-We had better, richer
lives here.
-[Ollie grunts]

12:16.431 --> 12:18.041
We had more money than now,

12:18.085 --> 12:21.218
but we weren't richrich,
like Professor X. [grunts]

12:21.262 --> 12:24.134
Dude, don't you see?
You're holding onto the past.

12:24.178 --> 12:26.615
That's more gross and
embarrassing than being poor.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.573
What? No. No, no.
That's, that's not...

12:28.617 --> 12:31.751
-JOHNNY: Oh, man... [grunting]
-It's Johnny. Ollie, run!

12:31.794 --> 12:33.535
[Johnny grunting]

12:33.578 --> 12:34.579
JOHNNY:
No, no.

12:34.623 --> 12:37.060
No, n-no, Mom.

12:37.104 --> 12:39.889
I'll sell--
I'll sell this house.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.326
There's nothing
wrong with it.

12:42.370 --> 12:46.243
No, Mom, there's nothing wrong
with me either. [groans]

12:46.287 --> 12:48.376
This freakin' guy.

12:48.419 --> 12:49.681
Wait a second, Johnny Frakes?

12:49.725 --> 12:50.987
Are we talking about
the same guy?

12:51.031 --> 12:53.773
This guy's who I want to be.
He's cool.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.035
He was my age when his mom built

12:55.078 --> 12:56.863
this whole neighborhood
and golf course.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.647
You know, Mom dumped
him in high school.

12:58.690 --> 13:02.216
What? Mom dated JF?
And she passed?

13:02.259 --> 13:05.828
Oh, see? There is stuff I know
that you don't.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.917
Got to learn to keep
your heart's ears open.

13:07.961 --> 13:10.354
[clicks tongue]
Not just your brain's.

13:10.398 --> 13:12.922
[Johnny moaning]

13:12.966 --> 13:15.925
Debbie. Oh, Debbie.

13:15.969 --> 13:18.145
How can I ever get rid of you?

13:18.188 --> 13:20.451
Dude, Johnny is just like you.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.105
Ew, not like this, he's not.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.238
You both are stuck in the past.

13:24.281 --> 13:27.241
I'm your Christmas Carol
ghost-guide person,

13:27.284 --> 13:30.244
and Johnny is the ghost
of future you!

13:30.287 --> 13:33.247
Mm-hmm. Oh, nice.

13:33.290 --> 13:36.946
I missed my chance with Debbie
in high school.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.818
And now she's with Freddie,

13:38.861 --> 13:42.865
and I waste my time
with girls, booze, golf,

13:42.909 --> 13:45.868
coke, RealDolls.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.478
But I have this house.

13:47.522 --> 13:51.526
This house is where I belong.

13:51.569 --> 13:53.876
Oh, my God.
You're so right.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.618
I-I didn't see it,
but I'm stuck in the past,

13:56.661 --> 13:58.141
like disgusting Johnny.

13:58.185 --> 14:02.319
I love our house, and he
makes love to our house.

14:02.363 --> 14:04.321
[urinating, whistling]

14:04.365 --> 14:06.933
Oh, s-sorry, buddy, I-I didn't
know anyone was in here.

14:06.976 --> 14:09.413
I just got slime on my hands.

14:09.457 --> 14:10.501
It's cool.

14:10.545 --> 14:12.590
Slime? Hoo-hoo. Wash that off.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.114
Hey, thanks.

14:14.157 --> 14:17.247
You know, I have a friend
who'd hate this kind of big,

14:17.291 --> 14:20.207
chaotic hang with multiple
unexpected guests.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.774
Oh, really? Who's this friend?

14:22.818 --> 14:26.561
Jack Masters
and his wife... Jut.

14:26.604 --> 14:29.564
Jack and... Jut Masters?

14:29.607 --> 14:34.656
Yep. They prefer more intimate
one-on-one, fam-on-fam hangs.

14:34.699 --> 14:36.876
-You know what I'm saying?
-Uh-huh.

14:36.919 --> 14:40.183
Oh, yeah, old Jack, he'd be
like, "Hey, aren't we enough?"

14:40.227 --> 14:42.403
[chuckles] You know? Shit.

14:42.446 --> 14:45.014
So, uh, what-what do you think
of, uh, Jack's take

14:45.058 --> 14:47.538
on your style of surprising
friends with other friends

14:47.582 --> 14:48.539
at your hangs?

14:48.583 --> 14:50.759
I think we should invite

14:50.802 --> 14:52.717
Jack Masters and his family

14:52.761 --> 14:55.024
to join the Harpers
and the Parkers

14:55.068 --> 14:56.896
next weekend for dinner.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.985
I love people!

14:59.028 --> 15:01.465
But just the three
families, right?

15:01.509 --> 15:03.598
Yep, just us three.

15:03.641 --> 15:04.947
But let's just do the parents

15:04.991 --> 15:06.383
so we can get to know
each other better.

15:06.427 --> 15:07.776
Perfect.

15:07.819 --> 15:11.867
I see now, I don't just love
this house and money

15:11.911 --> 15:13.303
and being superior.

15:13.347 --> 15:16.437
Yeah. Think there's
any copper up here?

15:16.480 --> 15:20.049
It's just that, in my former
life, I had worked so hard

15:20.093 --> 15:22.225
to establish myself
at that school.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.010
I... I mean, I guess
I kinda always knew

15:24.053 --> 15:25.402
that people didn't like me,

15:25.446 --> 15:27.317
but at least I had
earned a place,

15:27.361 --> 15:29.754
you know, a role,
some respect.

15:29.798 --> 15:32.018
And now I'm back to square one

15:32.061 --> 15:34.194
in this new neighborhood, and...

15:34.237 --> 15:36.631
and I'm just scared
to start all over.

15:36.674 --> 15:41.505
Dude, that is a new level
of emotional depth, my man.

15:41.549 --> 15:42.985
Tin Man gets a heart.

15:43.029 --> 15:46.728
All right.
Crouching hugs, hidden feelings.

15:46.771 --> 15:48.164
[Todd crying]

15:48.208 --> 15:51.080
So, do we just wait until
this pervert is done

15:51.124 --> 15:53.778
with the memory of our mom
so we can leave, or what?

15:53.822 --> 15:55.345
Ollie, I'm in crisis.

15:55.389 --> 15:57.739
You know, in order to
let go of the past,

15:57.782 --> 15:59.175
I must let go of this house.

15:59.219 --> 16:02.135
To get that, it's got to sell.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.791
Aah! The shitting ghosts!

16:06.835 --> 16:08.184
Dude, Johnny, you know us.

16:08.228 --> 16:09.881
We're going to help you
sell this house

16:09.925 --> 16:11.796
so both of us can let go.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.755
No! Shut up, ghost!

16:13.798 --> 16:15.757
I'm not ready to let go.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.978
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la, la...

16:19.021 --> 16:21.458
[tires screech]

16:21.502 --> 16:22.894
[cries out]

16:22.938 --> 16:25.985
Oh, the dust. Damn.

16:30.772 --> 16:34.036
I think I should just talk
straight, hard, mean.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.646
Friend stackers.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.432
No, no, no, listen, babe.
The early stage of a friendship

16:38.475 --> 16:40.303
is a subtle art;
it's like a courtship.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.740
But even more complex
'cause you can't

16:42.784 --> 16:44.351
prove anything with dick
or puss.

16:44.394 --> 16:47.876
Ugh, okay, you're right,
you're right.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.491
Ollie, don't forget to
do the Mom impression.

16:54.535 --> 16:55.797
What do I say?

16:55.840 --> 16:58.060
[deep voice]:
Johnny, I need to talk to you.

16:58.104 --> 17:03.065
Oh, my God, Debbie? I mean,
uh, cool. Why? What for?

17:03.109 --> 17:05.328
Meet me at my old house
right now,

17:05.372 --> 17:08.984
and we can totally say
"what for" then and there.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.727
-Um, okay, but no, not there.
-[whispers]: Is this good?

17:12.770 --> 17:14.076
I don't know if you remember,

17:14.120 --> 17:16.774
but that house has
two kid ghosts in it.

17:16.818 --> 17:18.559
Meet me now or never!

17:23.042 --> 17:25.044
Aah! The ghosts are solidified!

17:25.087 --> 17:28.699
And clean and...
Todd and Ollie.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.049
Get out of here.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.094
I'm meeting your mom
about adult stuff.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.704
You've got to let go of my mom.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.706
Yeah. Mom is different now.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.056
Everything is different now.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.666
Especially after we saw you try

17:38.709 --> 17:40.537
to hump her memory on the floor.

17:40.581 --> 17:41.973
[sighs]

17:42.017 --> 17:44.367
Oh, man, I'm found out.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.369
I haven't sold this house
on purpose

17:46.413 --> 17:50.199
because I'm holding
onto it as a vestige of Debbie.

17:50.243 --> 17:51.200
[crying]

17:51.244 --> 17:53.202
You kids are so smart.

17:53.246 --> 17:54.899
Todd says you got
to sell this house

17:54.943 --> 17:56.553
for both of you to get closure.

17:56.597 --> 17:59.991
Well, okay, that makes
a lot of sense.

18:00.035 --> 18:02.124
You guys, I got
the perfect buyer.

18:02.168 --> 18:04.126
It's a new family;
they were ready to buy,

18:04.170 --> 18:06.737
but I rubbed them
the wrong way.

18:06.781 --> 18:09.088
Oh, we can get them
back to the table.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.438
Oh, they saw me do cocaine,

18:11.481 --> 18:13.527
and when I offered them some,
they got mad.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.442
So I told them it was just
crushed up aspirin,

18:15.485 --> 18:18.009
but they knew I was lying.
I don't know, I was high.

18:18.053 --> 18:19.881
But they'd still be
interested, right?

18:19.924 --> 18:21.535
-Huh?
-Uh...

18:21.578 --> 18:26.453
So, where are Jack Masters
and his wife Jut?

18:26.496 --> 18:27.280
Jut?

18:27.323 --> 18:29.020
-Yes, Jut.
-[grunts]

18:29.064 --> 18:32.328
Well, uh, look, uh, don't worry
about those dudes. [laughs]

18:32.372 --> 18:35.418
Let's, uh, talk about
how you guys met. Was it fun?

18:35.462 --> 18:37.942
But I thought this was going
to be a triple date.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.771
Look, Jack Masters got...
typhoid or something, all right?

18:40.815 --> 18:44.210
No biggie. I-I-I mean, I barely
knew him and his gross family.

18:44.253 --> 18:46.908
[chuckles] Let's get
some drinks going. Waiter!

18:46.951 --> 18:48.562
You got a friend with typhoid?

18:48.605 --> 18:51.782
Oh, yeah. Oh, but Jack's cool,
though. He-He'll be fine.

18:51.826 --> 18:53.915
I know somebody at the CDC.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.264
I'll make a call right now,

18:55.308 --> 18:58.267
because heaven forbid
typhoid spreads!

18:58.311 --> 19:01.140
-No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
-Hey, CDC?

19:01.183 --> 19:02.619
Matt, Matt, no, I-I'm joking.

19:02.663 --> 19:04.969
Actually, uh, look,
I-I didn't want to say this,

19:05.013 --> 19:07.624
but it turns out
Jut divorced Jack for,

19:07.668 --> 19:11.498
you know, once upon a time,
uh, ha-having typhoid.

19:11.541 --> 19:15.066
So they're doing that
right now instead of this, uh...

19:15.110 --> 19:16.633
See, she can't get typhoid

19:16.677 --> 19:21.072
because she has typhus,and...

19:21.116 --> 19:24.163
Okay, okay, I've had enough.

19:24.206 --> 19:28.384
You guys are great, but you
have been "friend stacking" us.

19:28.428 --> 19:30.038
What?

19:30.081 --> 19:33.259
You make it seem like you want
to get together with just us,

19:33.302 --> 19:35.391
but then you turn it
into a friend stack.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.698
You friend stack,
and you should know

19:37.741 --> 19:39.700
that no one likes it.

19:39.743 --> 19:40.875
[weak laugh]

19:40.918 --> 19:44.183
But what about Jack Masters?

19:44.226 --> 19:46.837
That was just
Freddie's dumb lie.

19:46.881 --> 19:50.493
Wow. A lie? Hey, look, listen.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.495
We will deal with anything.
Anything.

19:52.539 --> 19:55.281
Drinks. Drugs.
Bad parenting skills.

19:55.324 --> 19:58.849
But we will not be
friends with liars.

19:58.893 --> 20:02.201
We never deal with liars!

20:02.244 --> 20:04.986
[sighs] Y'all disappoint us.
Let's go, Janet.

20:05.029 --> 20:07.510
We were just trying to help
you guys out, Debbie.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.295
It seems like
you don't have any friends.

20:09.338 --> 20:12.211
You were going to be
those friends.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.690
Not anymore.

20:13.734 --> 20:18.173
Waiter, bring us another round.
Their drinks, too.

20:21.394 --> 20:23.570
We got to warm these buyers up.

20:23.613 --> 20:25.528
Let's do the cute letter thing,
where the kids who grew up

20:25.572 --> 20:27.182
in a house write a sweet note
about how much

20:27.226 --> 20:28.575
they loved the house and shit.

20:28.618 --> 20:31.360
Oh, great idea.
Write this down.

20:33.144 --> 20:34.581
My name is Todd Harper.

20:34.624 --> 20:37.148
My twin sister Ollie and I
grew up in this home.

20:37.192 --> 20:39.629
A home built
on laughter and love.

20:39.673 --> 20:42.806
So when you buy this house
and you build your lives here,

20:42.850 --> 20:46.201
you will be continuing our
tradition of love and family.

20:46.245 --> 20:51.075
I have a new home now, and I'm
going to try to embrace it.

20:51.119 --> 20:52.990
[Johnny and Todd crying]

20:53.034 --> 20:54.383
TODD:
Yeah.

20:54.427 --> 20:57.386
Hey, thanks for helping me
get over the past.

20:57.430 --> 21:00.955
And if you ever see any kind of
inkling of a chance

21:00.998 --> 21:02.391
in your mom for me, let me know,

21:02.435 --> 21:04.567
and you'll be the richest
little stepkids in town.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.352
I'm gonna go
take this to the buyers.

21:06.395 --> 21:09.268
-I hope this works!
-[tires screeching]

21:09.311 --> 21:11.226
[sniffles]

21:11.270 --> 21:15.143
Aw. Want to go in
for one last goodbye?

21:17.537 --> 21:18.929
[sighs]

21:18.973 --> 21:20.322
Hey, the old house.

21:20.366 --> 21:23.282
Oh, my God, is that Todd
and Ollie?

21:23.325 --> 21:25.022
[scoffs] Park on the street.
Come on, Freddie,

21:25.066 --> 21:27.198
let's see what
those sneaky shits are up to.

21:27.242 --> 21:29.375
[crying]:
Yeah...

21:32.378 --> 21:34.989
Oh, man, look at them.

21:35.032 --> 21:38.862
Ollie will be fine, but Todd...

21:38.906 --> 21:40.734
I failed him.

21:40.777 --> 21:43.954
I should've done more
to preserve his world.

21:43.998 --> 21:47.741
He's so sensitive, my Toddie.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.439
Let's go in.

21:51.266 --> 21:53.137
Mom, Dad.

21:53.181 --> 21:55.226
So weird to see you here.

21:55.270 --> 21:58.317
Look, we-we-we know we had a lot
of great times in this house,

21:58.360 --> 22:00.362
but you got to let it go.

22:00.406 --> 22:02.059
BOTH:
Yeah, we know.

22:02.103 --> 22:05.367
And I think we may have just
helped Johnny sell this house.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.804
Aw, that's great, guys.

22:07.848 --> 22:10.372
And, Toddie,

22:10.416 --> 22:13.984
I know our new house
isn't exactly right...

22:14.028 --> 22:16.813
[laughs]
...but it's pretty okay.

22:16.857 --> 22:19.425
You got to let go of your past,
let go of your expectations

22:19.468 --> 22:20.817
and just go with the flow.

22:20.861 --> 22:24.125
You got to... got to be okay
with spontaneity.

22:24.168 --> 22:27.258
No, Mom, really, I just learned
that exact lesson.

22:27.302 --> 22:30.174
Yeah. In fact, it's the lesson
you should have learned

22:30.218 --> 22:31.698
with your friends the Parkers.

22:31.741 --> 22:34.570
Fuck that.
Friend stacking sucks.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.442
You truly can never
go home again.

22:36.485 --> 22:39.183
But truly, can we go home?

22:39.227 --> 22:40.750
I'm sick of this place.

22:44.537 --> 22:48.845
You know, it's still hard
saying goodbye to this place.

22:48.889 --> 22:52.414
Oh, really?
Well, does this help?

22:52.458 --> 22:54.155
Your dad and I had sex
right there.

22:54.198 --> 22:56.113
Ew, gross, don't ruin it for me.

22:56.157 --> 22:57.680
That's the point.

22:57.724 --> 22:59.943
Oh, we did it right there, too,
when you were at camp.

22:59.987 --> 23:01.292
La, la, la, la, la...

23:01.336 --> 23:04.339
We did it in all the rooms,
yeah!

23:04.383 --> 23:06.907
-Mom, stop it!
-Ruined yet?!

23:10.737 --> 23:11.912
[gasps]

23:11.955 --> 23:15.872
Hey! That was a sweet note
written by kids.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.874
Was it the cocaine?

23:17.918 --> 23:20.442
Cocaine? No.

23:20.486 --> 23:22.575
We didn't care
about your cocaine.

23:22.618 --> 23:26.405
It was that you lied about it
and said it was aspirin.

23:26.448 --> 23:28.537
We hate liars.

23:28.581 --> 23:31.714
You know, we almost went
against our no-liar policy

23:31.758 --> 23:33.455
to buy that house
from you, liar.

23:33.499 --> 23:36.502
Luckily, we got lied to
by a lying couple today,

23:36.545 --> 23:39.026
so we are back to our hard-line,
no-liar stance.

23:41.463 --> 23:45.119
So the house doesn't sell.

23:45.162 --> 23:47.251
Debbie, I'm coming for you.

23:47.295 --> 23:48.818
