00:06.964 --> 00:08.798
Last night,
I killed Dylan Hinchey

00:08.881 --> 00:10.005
for killing my little girl.

00:10.255 --> 00:13.255
You didn't kill him, Kenny.
Dylan Hinchey's alive.

00:16.005 --> 00:18.214
I need Dylan to submit
a DNA sample.

00:18.422 --> 00:19.506
We received information

00:19.589 --> 00:21.297
that he might not be
DJ's real father.

00:22.631 --> 00:25.297
If we go to court,
I'm gonna tell the judge
that you're an unfit mother.

00:25.381 --> 00:27.631
He's my son, goddammit! Mine!

00:27.923 --> 00:29.881
She's the mother.
She'll get custody,

00:29.964 --> 00:32.339
and there's not a damn thing
you or I can do about it.

00:32.714 --> 00:35.881
Kenny said she was killed
between midnight and 2:00 a.m.

00:36.631 --> 00:39.005
We're 13.7 miles away
from Creedham Creek.

00:39.255 --> 00:41.089
There's no way she rode
her bike that far.

00:41.589 --> 00:43.047
Someone must have picked her up.

00:44.506 --> 00:46.506
Station got a call
from Carrie Layden.

00:46.589 --> 00:49.506
Cops found two packets of heroin
in her glove compartment.

00:49.756 --> 00:52.756
She swore that you must have
planted them on her.

00:52.839 --> 00:54.881
She's a drug addict.
She'll say anything.

00:54.964 --> 00:56.756
-Gun and badge.
-Please...

01:09.089 --> 01:10.422
Mare?

01:10.506 --> 01:12.839
Mare, are you-- are you
gonna be home tonight

01:12.923 --> 01:15.255
or are you--
are you working late?

01:15.339 --> 01:17.631
Uh, yeah, I should be home.

01:17.714 --> 01:20.714
Okay, well, I'll--
I'll roast a chicken then.

01:20.798 --> 01:22.923
Hey, Drew, say--
say goodbye to your grandma.

01:23.005 --> 01:25.214
-Bye, Gran!
-Okay, bye.

01:30.881 --> 01:32.714
Bye, Mom.

02:37.422 --> 02:39.297
Take 'em.

02:39.381 --> 02:41.506
If I ask for another one,
tell me to fuck off.

02:44.547 --> 02:46.422
Did you tell your family yet?

02:48.464 --> 02:49.547
Do I have to?

02:50.422 --> 02:52.631
Uh, I mean,
I guess you could

02:52.714 --> 02:55.214
just pretend to go
to work every day.

03:00.464 --> 03:04.214
Chief's making me see
some grief therapist

03:04.297 --> 03:07.714
as a part of my suspension.

03:09.589 --> 03:12.172
Well, I know it's not what
you want, Mare,

03:12.255 --> 03:15.589
but it might be
a good thing to step away.

03:16.881 --> 03:19.422
And Katie Bailey, Erin...

03:23.255 --> 03:25.255
Your family's
worried about you.

03:27.964 --> 03:29.881
You're not talking anymore.

03:30.923 --> 03:32.381
You never talk about him
anymore, Mare.

03:32.464 --> 03:34.756
Yeah, my son killed himself,
Lor.

03:34.839 --> 03:38.714
I'm sorry if I'm not the life
of the fucking party.

03:38.798 --> 03:42.589
Well, first of all, you were
never the life of the party.

03:49.130 --> 03:50.798
You're pushing everyone away.

03:53.631 --> 03:54.798
Including you?

03:57.130 --> 03:58.464
No, I won't let you.

04:18.923 --> 04:21.005
All right. Two creams, no sugar.

04:25.339 --> 04:26.381
Morning, Chief.

04:27.673 --> 04:28.839
Hauser.

04:28.923 --> 04:32.005
-What are you doing here?
-Morning, Zabel. Shut the door.

04:37.631 --> 04:40.297
What's going on? Where's Mare?

04:40.381 --> 04:42.923
She's stepping back
on the McMenamin case,

04:43.005 --> 04:45.381
needs some time to deal
with her personal stuff.

04:45.464 --> 04:47.589
You'll run point moving forward.

04:47.673 --> 04:49.506
Detective Hauser
will assist you.

04:50.547 --> 04:53.339
DNA results came in
this morning.

04:53.422 --> 04:56.047
Frank Sheehan
isn't that baby's father.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.047
Neither is Dylan Hinchey.

04:59.964 --> 05:03.923
-Well, somebody is.
-No shit, kid.

05:06.255 --> 05:09.255
I'll be in my office
if you need anything.

05:12.047 --> 05:13.839
That for me, hotshot?

05:16.047 --> 05:18.047
Yeah. Sure.

05:19.339 --> 05:20.881
You got any half-and-half?

05:22.881 --> 05:25.214
There's a kitchen
right over there.

05:35.839 --> 05:38.005
-"One ear and his brother."
-Oh, my gosh.

05:38.089 --> 05:40.631
-"One mouth, one big nose."
-Oh, my gosh.

05:40.714 --> 05:42.589
"Two feet
with one, two, three, four,

05:42.673 --> 05:43.923
five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten toes."

05:44.005 --> 05:45.798
Why the hell are you
treating him like that?

05:48.422 --> 05:49.839
Treat him like what?

05:49.923 --> 05:52.005
Kissing him, and hugging
and laughing.

05:52.089 --> 05:53.381
He ain't even ours.

05:53.464 --> 05:54.631
It's not his fault, D.

05:54.714 --> 05:57.255
He's a baby.
We gotta take care of him.

05:57.339 --> 05:58.798
-Get him outta here.

05:58.881 --> 06:00.089
D, you gotta stay calm.

06:00.172 --> 06:02.172
-Dylan, stop.
-Get him outta here!

06:02.255 --> 06:03.923
-Dylan.
-Out!

06:08.339 --> 06:09.547
Come on.

06:16.589 --> 06:18.631
Eat your vegetables, please.

06:20.172 --> 06:22.381
I don't like broccoli, Granny.

06:22.464 --> 06:25.089
Well, your mom loved broccoli.

06:25.172 --> 06:26.923
I used to tell her
she was gonna turn into

06:27.005 --> 06:29.214
a piece of broccoli,
she ate so much of it.

06:30.339 --> 06:36.839
A big green piece of broccoli.

06:41.756 --> 06:42.714
Hello?

06:42.798 --> 06:44.673
Do you
miss your daughter, Dawn?

06:44.756 --> 06:48.631
'Cause Katie misses you.
Are you listening to me?

06:48.714 --> 06:50.923
Who are you?
Why are you calling me?

06:51.005 --> 06:54.714
I'm calling to tell you
Katie's ready to come home.

06:54.798 --> 06:57.214
Well, if Katie's there,
then put her on the phone.

06:57.297 --> 06:59.381
-I can't do that, Dawn.
-I don't believe you.

06:59.464 --> 07:01.381
If you have Katie,
prove to me that she's alive.

07:01.464 --> 07:02.714
Five thousand dollars.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.714
I don't have
five thousand dollars. I don't--

07:04.798 --> 07:06.964
-Katie needs you, Dawn.
-Oh, wait, wait, wait.

07:07.047 --> 07:08.631
Don't hang up.
Please, please, don't hang up.

07:08.714 --> 07:10.589
-I'll be in touch.
-Hello?

07:10.673 --> 07:14.130
- Hello?

07:33.464 --> 07:35.255
-Hey.
-Hey.

07:35.339 --> 07:37.047
We're having
a family meeting.

07:37.130 --> 07:38.464
A what?

07:39.297 --> 07:42.339
Drew. Um, here you go.

07:43.631 --> 07:44.756
Nana's iPad.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.464
Here, take that into my room
and, uh, play a game, okay?

07:47.547 --> 07:49.964
Okay. And, uh,
close the door. All right.

07:50.047 --> 07:51.297
-Mom?
-Yeah?

07:51.381 --> 07:53.005
We're having
a family meeting.

07:54.464 --> 07:56.297
The hell's a family meeting?

07:56.381 --> 07:59.381
All right. Family meeting
in the dining room, okay?

08:10.506 --> 08:12.297
Um...

08:12.381 --> 08:15.923
I stole two bags of heroin
from the evidence closet at work

08:16.005 --> 08:18.631
and I planted them
in Carrie's car.

08:18.714 --> 08:20.589
I was hoping
that she'd get pulled over

08:20.673 --> 08:22.255
and arrested for possession.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.172
But it backfired, and, um...

08:27.255 --> 08:31.631
Chief, uh, knows it was me,
and I've been suspended.

08:34.297 --> 08:36.381
My God, Marianne.

08:36.464 --> 08:38.714
I-- I-- I don't know
what the hell to say.

08:41.047 --> 08:44.089
Oh, wait. It just came to me.
That was stupid!

08:45.255 --> 08:47.089
Goddamn idiotic!

08:47.172 --> 08:50.047
You're a complete smacked-ass
for doing that.

08:54.589 --> 08:55.589
Thanks, Mom.

08:55.673 --> 08:57.673
Does Carrie know it was you?

08:57.756 --> 09:00.464
-She can't prove it, no.
-Well, thank God.

09:00.547 --> 09:02.756
Otherwise,
we'd lose Drew forever.

09:10.881 --> 09:12.756
Any thoughts?

09:12.839 --> 09:16.130
I think
Gran summed it up nicely.

09:17.798 --> 09:21.798
But if we're sharing,
I split up with Becca today.

09:23.714 --> 09:26.297
You--
Did you meet somebody else?

09:27.255 --> 09:30.506
No. No, it just ran its course.

09:31.631 --> 09:32.756
I'm sorry.

09:36.547 --> 09:39.047
Do you have anything
you'd like to share, Mom?

09:39.130 --> 09:42.381
You seem like you wanna
say something else.

09:42.464 --> 09:44.964
No. Just wondering
what the hell I'm gonna do,

09:45.047 --> 09:46.798
stuck in the house
with you all day.

10:00.172 --> 10:01.214
Dr. Graham?

10:02.839 --> 10:04.172
-Mare Sheehan.
-Hi.

10:06.297 --> 10:08.589
So, I bet you see
a lot of cops, huh?

10:08.673 --> 10:11.047
Oh, I've seen a few
over the years, yes.

10:11.130 --> 10:14.589
Hard cases, right?
Like, they don't wanna be here.

10:14.673 --> 10:16.255
They don't think
they need the help.

10:16.339 --> 10:19.214
-Oh, some, but most are--
-You know, I just wanna say

10:19.297 --> 10:20.964
you don't have to
worry about that with me.

10:21.047 --> 10:22.923
I'll be here on time,
every time.

10:23.005 --> 10:24.839
-Wonderful.
-Awesome.

10:24.923 --> 10:26.047
You're actually
a little bit early.

10:26.130 --> 10:27.631
So, how does this work, exactly?

10:27.714 --> 10:31.089
Like, you know,
I come in, we talk it out,

10:31.172 --> 10:32.756
you submit a report
to the department

10:32.839 --> 10:33.923
saying I cooperated,

10:34.005 --> 10:35.923
and we do that for a while
and we're good to go?

10:37.130 --> 10:39.339
-Basically, yes.
-Okay.

10:40.047 --> 10:41.881
It's just, um...

10:41.964 --> 10:45.005
you know,
before we get into all this...

10:45.089 --> 10:47.756
I don't want you
to get discouraged. That's all.

10:49.047 --> 10:50.214
Discouraged?

10:50.297 --> 10:52.631
Like, you know, if there's not,
like, a big breakthrough

10:52.714 --> 10:54.798
or something, you know?
It's not you.

10:54.881 --> 10:56.255
I've done this before.
Therapy.

10:56.339 --> 10:58.255
Me and my husband,
we saw this marriage counselor.

10:58.339 --> 11:00.798
Mm-hmm.
What was that experience like?

11:00.881 --> 11:03.047
-We're divorced.
-Oh.

11:04.339 --> 11:08.130
Right. So, like,
that's what I mean. You know?

11:08.214 --> 11:10.130
I mean, I understand
this kind of thing

11:10.214 --> 11:11.756
can be helpful
for some people.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.923
This cop I used to work with,
Sweeney, fucking prick,

11:15.005 --> 11:17.089
he, uh, used to, you know,

11:17.172 --> 11:19.255
like he-- he-- he was
out on patrol one night

11:19.339 --> 11:21.631
and, um, ran his car
into an old lady

11:21.714 --> 11:24.381
and killed her, you know?
Really messed him up.

11:24.464 --> 11:25.964
So he started
seeing a therapist.

11:26.047 --> 11:30.047
Two months later, he, uh,
quits his job, buys a dog,

11:30.130 --> 11:32.464
starts, like, hugging his wife
all the time.

11:32.547 --> 11:35.297
And now he's a park guide
over at Valley Forge.

11:35.381 --> 11:37.506
Happy as a clam. Bingo.

11:39.506 --> 11:42.798
It's just, for me,
I, you know...

11:44.673 --> 11:47.214
-Hasn't worked yet?
-Right.

11:48.589 --> 11:51.381
Right. You know.

11:51.464 --> 11:55.255
Anyway, so I just wanna
throw that out there.

11:55.339 --> 11:57.172
So you're not, like,

11:57.255 --> 12:01.839
disappointed if there's not
a big "hallelujah" moment.

12:02.714 --> 12:06.130
Understood. Why don't we try?

12:13.005 --> 12:14.756
Let the healing begin.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.547
Deacon Mark, Detective Zabel.

12:29.631 --> 12:32.130
-Yes. Hello.
-Hi.

12:32.214 --> 12:34.673
Been trying to get a hold
of you for the past few days.

12:34.756 --> 12:36.130
Did you get my voicemails?

12:36.214 --> 12:37.839
Yes. Yes, I did. Sorry. Sorry.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.297
Things have been busy
over at the church.

12:39.381 --> 12:41.297
I was beginning to think
you were avoiding me.

12:42.255 --> 12:43.964
Were you?

12:44.047 --> 12:47.923
What can I
help you with, Detective?

12:48.005 --> 12:51.756
Well, uh, I just wanted
to ask you some questions

12:51.839 --> 12:52.839
about the circumstances

12:52.923 --> 12:54.964
of your transfer here
to St. Michael's.

12:56.005 --> 12:58.089
Well, I'm afraid
I won't be much help.

12:58.172 --> 12:59.589
All Augustinian reassignments

12:59.673 --> 13:01.839
are dealt with
the provincial's office, so--

13:01.923 --> 13:04.756
Well, more specifically about
the sexual misconduct complaint

13:04.839 --> 13:06.631
filed against you
at your previous parish

13:06.714 --> 13:09.422
by, uh, the parents
of a 14-year-old girl.

13:09.506 --> 13:11.547
Uh, I've been instructed
by the archdiocese

13:11.631 --> 13:13.339
not to speak about that case.

13:14.756 --> 13:16.589
Look, Deac,
I-- I-- I was raised Catholic.

13:16.673 --> 13:18.130
I'm trying to be
on your side here.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.798
But you can understand
why I'd be concerned, right?

13:20.881 --> 13:22.130
I find out that the last person

13:22.214 --> 13:24.130
to speak with Erin McMenamin
on the night she's murdered

13:24.214 --> 13:25.673
potentially had
an inappropriate relationship

13:25.756 --> 13:26.881
with another young girl.

13:26.964 --> 13:29.172
The archdiocese investigated
the incident, detective,

13:29.255 --> 13:32.547
and believe
nothing happened. Nothing.

13:34.422 --> 13:35.839
And what should I believe?

13:40.172 --> 13:42.422
You better start getting
your story straight, Mark.

13:42.506 --> 13:44.130
'Cause if I got the tip
about your past,

13:44.214 --> 13:46.339
it won't be long
till everyone finds out.

13:47.214 --> 13:48.255
Thank you.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.839
Well, I mean-- I mean,
it took me a long time

14:02.923 --> 14:04.839
to realize this,
but the reality is,

14:04.923 --> 14:07.798
I, you know, maybe I'm just
not a great writer.

14:07.881 --> 14:11.005
I-- I only had one book in me,
you know. But you know what?

14:11.089 --> 14:12.923
I'm okay with that.

14:13.005 --> 14:14.964
Well, at least you had
your one shot.

14:15.047 --> 14:16.839
Most people never even get that.

14:16.923 --> 14:19.964
-You got yours, Lady Hawk.

14:20.047 --> 14:25.214
-You like being a teacher?
-Um, well, I've-- I've grown to.

14:25.297 --> 14:27.756
Um, I always used
to look at teaching

14:27.839 --> 14:29.673
as the-- the thing that you did

14:29.756 --> 14:32.339
if you couldn't do the thing
you wanted to do.

14:32.422 --> 14:34.631
So it's kind of a nice reminder

14:34.714 --> 14:36.339
that my life
is steadily declining.

14:36.422 --> 14:40.714
Lucky me. Catch you
on the down slide, huh?

14:42.798 --> 14:45.005
Hey, did you
talk to Drew's mother?

14:45.089 --> 14:49.130
-Uh, yeah. Yeah, I did.
-And? How did that go?

14:50.506 --> 14:53.214
It was a...
it was a car crash.

14:53.297 --> 14:56.798
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
Why? What happened?

14:56.881 --> 15:00.631
I just, um, I fucked it up,
uh, and she's...

15:01.297 --> 15:02.673
Oh, look, she's...

15:07.464 --> 15:08.506
What about Frank?

15:08.589 --> 15:10.798
Does he, you know,
does he ever talk to her?

15:10.881 --> 15:13.964
Uh, no, he's the good cop.

15:16.923 --> 15:18.673
You ever give yourself a break?

15:21.964 --> 15:25.589
I mean, do you ever just get
to take time for yourself?

15:25.673 --> 15:27.714
Are you about to tell me
I look exhausted?

15:27.798 --> 15:28.923
No. No.

15:29.005 --> 15:32.297
But it seems like you're
carrying a lot of heavy stuff,

15:32.381 --> 15:34.381
and I, you know,
I wonder if anybody

15:34.464 --> 15:36.047
ever does anything for you.

15:37.964 --> 15:40.798
-Listen...

15:41.964 --> 15:44.923
Saturday is my birthday.
Not that I expect a gift,

15:45.005 --> 15:47.839
but why don't you
let me take you out?

15:50.798 --> 15:52.464
Where are we goin'?

15:52.547 --> 15:54.464
I don't know,
but I will figure it out,

15:54.547 --> 15:56.631
and I will surprise you
when I pick you up

15:56.714 --> 15:58.172
at seven o'clock.

16:16.214 --> 16:18.339
So, someone called me
the other night,

16:19.339 --> 16:21.297
telling me that Katie was alive

16:21.381 --> 16:23.005
and that they knew
where she was.

16:23.089 --> 16:24.756
Oh, my God.
Well, what did they say?

16:26.881 --> 16:28.214
If I wanted to find out where,

16:28.297 --> 16:30.381
I'd have to give 'em
five thousand dollars.

16:30.464 --> 16:33.255
Okay. Well, that's a scam.
That is-- I don't like that.

16:33.339 --> 16:35.130
You need
to tell Mare about that.

16:35.214 --> 16:36.923
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

16:37.005 --> 16:38.547
Yeah, you're right. I should.

16:40.839 --> 16:42.839
Mare's not working anymore,
though.

16:42.923 --> 16:43.839
What?

16:43.923 --> 16:46.631
Yeah. I ran
into Jan Kelly at Kmart.

16:46.714 --> 16:47.673
Mm-hmm.

16:47.756 --> 16:50.589
Apparently, she had
some sort of breakdown.

16:51.798 --> 16:55.047
You know, her family stuff,
her divorce.

16:56.255 --> 16:57.839
-Kevin.

16:57.923 --> 16:59.339
I don't know.

16:59.422 --> 17:02.089
I feel like I might've
played a part in all of that.

17:02.172 --> 17:04.923
No. You did exactly
what any mother would do.

17:06.172 --> 17:07.422
-You did.

17:10.589 --> 17:13.464
-Hey, Dawn.
-Hiya, Freddie.

17:19.756 --> 17:21.964
You didn't tell me
he was back living here.

17:22.047 --> 17:25.381
Yeah. He's been living
in the basement

17:25.464 --> 17:28.047
-the past few days.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.047
Uh...

17:30.130 --> 17:32.005
He overdosed on Friday.

17:32.089 --> 17:34.464
Right in front
of DeSanto's Deli.

17:34.547 --> 17:36.172
Police showed up with Narcan

17:36.255 --> 17:38.673
and literally brought him back
from the dead.

17:38.756 --> 17:40.756
Jesus. Why didn't you tell me?

17:40.839 --> 17:42.756
With everything
you've got going on? No.

17:42.839 --> 17:47.714
It's fine.
It's fine. He's fine.

17:47.798 --> 17:50.464
-Just...
-Bethy, come on.

17:52.130 --> 17:56.297
Okay.
Terrence does not...

17:59.214 --> 18:00.589
I think he's just...

18:03.422 --> 18:06.297
This whole thing
is ruining our marriage.

18:07.756 --> 18:10.047
I don't know, like-- I just--
He's my brother,

18:10.130 --> 18:12.089
and I feel like
if he's here with me,

18:12.172 --> 18:14.339
then I know that
he's not just out there.

18:23.214 --> 18:25.881
It's okay.
I'm fine. I'm sorry.

18:25.964 --> 18:28.047
I'm not gonna do this right now.

18:29.172 --> 18:31.839
Uh... Dinner's ready.

18:33.673 --> 18:35.673
It's our first
sleepover together.

18:40.464 --> 18:43.923
One, two, three, ta-da!

18:45.297 --> 18:48.255
What do you think?
It's not bad, right?

18:48.339 --> 18:49.839
-Right.
-For now?

18:50.714 --> 18:52.047
Wanna go check out your bed?

18:52.130 --> 18:53.214
-Yeah.
-Come on.

18:57.631 --> 19:01.255
I even got you your projector.
For your stars.

19:01.339 --> 19:02.547
What do you think?

19:15.214 --> 19:17.714
I'm so happy you're here.

19:18.881 --> 19:19.881
Hey, you hungry?

19:19.964 --> 19:22.047
-Yeah.
-You wanna get some pizza?

19:22.130 --> 19:24.255
Pizza, pizza, pizza.

19:25.714 --> 19:28.255
So, wait,
you still like pizza, right?

19:28.339 --> 19:30.047
-Right.
-Right.

19:30.923 --> 19:33.089
Come on, let's see. Mm.

19:45.506 --> 19:48.714
It was DJ's first birthday
yesterday, and...

19:49.839 --> 19:52.089
I-- I was going through
my old journals,

19:52.172 --> 19:55.923
just re-reading entries
over the past year, and...

19:57.422 --> 20:01.464
I'm just so tired and exhausted
all the time, and...

20:04.005 --> 20:06.381
It's just like, some nights
I, like, seriously feel

20:06.464 --> 20:08.005
like a terrible mother.

20:08.089 --> 20:10.005
I want him to have a great life,

20:10.089 --> 20:12.339
and I'm trying
to give that to him.

20:12.422 --> 20:15.589
I just want so bad
to give him everything...

20:23.923 --> 20:25.255
Kevin! Kevin, open the door.

20:25.339 --> 20:27.547
I just wanna see
if you have any money!
You told me you didn't,

20:27.631 --> 20:29.339
-so I wanna see
if you're a liar or not.
-Open this door, goddamnit!

20:29.422 --> 20:30.714
You're not buying drugs
with my money!

20:30.798 --> 20:31.881
Look at that!

20:31.964 --> 20:34.714
You're a fucking liar,
just like I thought you were.

20:34.798 --> 20:35.964
Fuck!

20:36.047 --> 20:38.130
Lock it! Lock it!
Lock it, lock it, lock it.

20:40.631 --> 20:42.547
What the fuck is your problem?

20:42.631 --> 20:44.673
-Fucking give me my purse!
-Go! Carrie, run!

20:44.756 --> 20:45.964
And don't think about getting--

20:46.047 --> 20:47.964
-Don't fucking touch him!
-Kevin, stop!

20:48.047 --> 20:49.714
What the fuck is wrong with you?

20:49.798 --> 20:52.714
Please, stop it, Kevin.
Stop it, Kevin!

20:52.798 --> 20:57.172
I fucking hate you!
Fucking hate you.

21:05.923 --> 21:08.047
You stupid fucking bitch.

21:21.756 --> 21:22.839
Hey.

21:24.339 --> 21:28.172
He, uh, couldn't sleep.
Said he missed his turtle.

21:28.964 --> 21:33.172
Hey. Hi. You okay?

21:33.255 --> 21:35.047
-Yeah.
-You feel okay?

21:35.130 --> 21:37.089
-Yeah.
-Okay.

21:37.172 --> 21:40.339
Well, go on up to bed, okay?
Good boy.

21:45.798 --> 21:48.673
-Thanks.
-I know it was you.

21:50.464 --> 21:51.714
The drugs.

21:52.714 --> 21:54.506
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:56.297 --> 21:59.381
You know, I'm trying really hard
to get my life together.

22:01.631 --> 22:03.047
So stop.

22:04.547 --> 22:05.923
Just stop.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.047
Mom.

22:25.339 --> 22:26.422
Mom!

22:27.798 --> 22:28.798
Mom!

22:32.089 --> 22:33.589
Please!

23:51.506 --> 23:54.839
I hate the cold.

23:55.506 --> 23:58.673
Like, I seriously hate it.

24:01.839 --> 24:04.381
It's funny, I didn't even know
there was any different

24:04.464 --> 24:07.506
till I went down to Disney World
when I was, like, ten.

24:08.464 --> 24:11.255
And it was like, "Wow.

24:11.339 --> 24:14.798
There are actual places
that never get cold," you know?

24:18.172 --> 24:22.381
My sister and I, we must've
done that Space Mountain ride...

24:22.464 --> 24:25.130
...like, ten times.

24:25.214 --> 24:30.089
We'd just go on,
get off, get back in line.

24:30.172 --> 24:32.714
Go on, get off,
get back in line.

24:32.798 --> 24:34.297
My dad was like,

24:34.381 --> 24:36.506
"I didn't pay
all this friggin' money

24:36.589 --> 24:40.172
for you girls to go on one ride.
Do something else."

24:44.047 --> 24:46.005
He was seriously pissed
about it.

25:10.589 --> 25:12.381
This your first time doing this?

25:19.047 --> 25:21.798
Uh, it's been three days
since we last saw Missy.

25:21.881 --> 25:24.506
She left home
Thursday night around 7:00,

25:24.589 --> 25:27.089
and we haven't heard
from her since then.

25:27.172 --> 25:30.881
And, uh, we're just asking
anyone who knows anything

25:30.964 --> 25:33.255
to please come forward...

25:34.923 --> 25:36.839
and bring her home.

25:36.923 --> 25:38.923
Local News Nine
has set up a tip line

25:39.005 --> 25:40.255
for anyone with information

25:40.339 --> 25:42.964
about the disappearance
of Missy Sager or Katie Bailey.

25:43.047 --> 25:44.547
-If you have any--

25:47.631 --> 25:51.255
-Maybe it's a serial killer.
-Christ, Mom.

25:52.255 --> 25:55.130
Well, I mean,
it is the third girl, Mare.

25:57.673 --> 26:01.297
-Just saying.

26:03.756 --> 26:06.673
-Mare, will you--
-Don't say it, Mom. Just don't.

26:06.756 --> 26:07.714
Don't say what?

26:07.798 --> 26:09.422
Don't try and stop me
from going out

26:09.506 --> 26:11.381
-and doing my job, okay?
-Mare.

26:11.464 --> 26:13.464
Before you tell me
this is a bad idea,

26:13.547 --> 26:16.297
have I ever listened
to a thing you told me?

26:17.589 --> 26:19.047
I just wanted you
to get the popcorn

26:19.130 --> 26:21.172
out of the microwave
before you leave.

26:22.547 --> 26:23.589
Oh.

26:27.089 --> 26:30.339
-Ow! Hot.

26:38.255 --> 26:41.255
I ran into Susan Foster
at the hardware store.

26:41.339 --> 26:44.506
We hadn't seen each other
in a few months.

26:44.589 --> 26:47.255
She was telling me
that she read the article

26:47.339 --> 26:49.381
-about you.
-Yeah?

26:49.464 --> 26:53.506
Her oldest daughter
lives over in Easttown now.

26:53.589 --> 26:55.756
And I told her
that you had just been sent in

26:55.839 --> 26:58.047
to help out on the case
of that poor girl

26:58.130 --> 27:00.047
that they found
at Creedham Creek.

27:00.130 --> 27:02.589
Her daughter thought
that was a good thing.

27:02.673 --> 27:03.923
Yeah?

27:04.005 --> 27:06.964
Apparently, there was
another missing girl last year.

27:07.047 --> 27:09.339
-Katie Bailey.
-Right.

27:09.422 --> 27:10.756
And everyone's up in arms

27:10.839 --> 27:13.547
over how the police
are handling that case.

27:15.255 --> 27:18.464
I don't think they understand
how hard of a case that was.

27:18.547 --> 27:20.506
Mare's a good detective.

27:20.589 --> 27:22.923
Is Mare the one
they just let go?

27:23.756 --> 27:25.631
Yeah.

27:25.714 --> 27:30.381
Well, it sounds like she was
maybe in over her head.

27:31.130 --> 27:32.881
They're lucky they have you.

27:38.839 --> 27:40.047
Bless us, O Lord...

27:40.130 --> 27:43.714
And these thy gifts
which we're about to receive...

27:43.798 --> 27:48.381
from thy bounty
through Christ our Lord.

27:48.464 --> 27:51.381
-Amen.

28:00.130 --> 28:01.589
-Hi.
-Hi.

28:04.130 --> 28:07.172
-What are you doing here?
-Saw the news.

28:07.255 --> 28:11.381
Right. Uh, come in,
come in, come in.

28:12.923 --> 28:15.964
Mom, this is my Mare--
my partner, Mare,

28:16.047 --> 28:18.923
Detective Mare Sheehan.
This is my mom, Judy.

28:19.297 --> 28:20.255
Hello.

28:20.339 --> 28:24.047
Hi, Mare. We were
just talking about you.

28:24.130 --> 28:27.798
Are you hungry?
We made plenty.

28:27.881 --> 28:30.214
No, I'm-- I'm good, thank you.

28:31.589 --> 28:33.089
-Want a beer?
-Sure.

28:33.172 --> 28:34.214
Great.

28:34.756 --> 28:35.756
Thank you.

28:40.005 --> 28:41.214
Okay. Missy Sager,

28:41.297 --> 28:43.631
graduated top of her class
from Sun Valley.

28:43.714 --> 28:46.172
Gymnastics, field hockey,
student council.

28:46.255 --> 28:48.881
She enrolled in the nursing
program at Kutztown University.

28:48.964 --> 28:50.339
Freshman year,
she's crossing the street,

28:50.422 --> 28:54.130
an old lady runs a stop sign
and hits her. Fractures her hip.

28:54.214 --> 28:57.172
Soon after, she starts on Oxy,
then morphine.

28:57.255 --> 28:59.130
You know the rest of the story.

28:59.214 --> 29:01.798
Her phone was shut off
at 2:23 a.m. Friday.

29:01.881 --> 29:03.714
Social media accounts
all went dark as well.

29:03.798 --> 29:06.839
No contact with her mom,
dad, sister, friends since.

29:09.839 --> 29:12.339
Hauser doesn't think
these cases are related.

29:12.422 --> 29:14.214
Missy Sager
and Katie Bailey maybe,

29:14.297 --> 29:15.798
but not Erin.

29:17.339 --> 29:18.964
Hauser my replacement?

29:19.839 --> 29:22.047
He was our PT instructor
at the academy.

29:22.130 --> 29:23.089
As a graduation gift,

29:23.172 --> 29:25.005
all six of us
took a shit in his trunk.

29:30.673 --> 29:33.881
So, come on. What do you think?

29:36.547 --> 29:38.673
I think their lifestyles
are too different.

29:38.756 --> 29:40.005
Katie and Missy
were drug abusers

29:40.089 --> 29:42.255
who had turned to prostitution
to support their habit.

29:42.339 --> 29:44.839
Both had
active Sidedoor accounts.

29:44.923 --> 29:46.089
There's no evidence to suggest

29:46.172 --> 29:47.839
that Erin was involved
in prostitution.

29:49.422 --> 29:53.089
No evidence.
But she could have been.

29:53.172 --> 29:54.923
Nothing turned up
on her phone or computer.

29:55.005 --> 29:57.589
No postings, pictures,
or e-mails.

29:57.673 --> 30:00.547
We know she needed the money
for her son's ear surgery.

30:01.506 --> 30:04.255
ENT office told me
she scheduled it,

30:04.339 --> 30:06.089
cancelled, twice.

30:07.255 --> 30:08.964
If you're a teenage girl,

30:09.047 --> 30:10.589
baby at home
and a dad like Kenny,

30:10.673 --> 30:13.547
you're not gonna
open an account on Sidedoor

30:13.631 --> 30:17.089
with pictures like this
on your own computer.

30:17.172 --> 30:20.923
Trust me, teenage girls
are fucking sneaky.

30:26.255 --> 30:28.547
Wanna tell me the real reason
they put you on leave?

30:34.923 --> 30:38.339
One day. Right now,
I just wanna drink these beers

30:38.422 --> 30:41.589
and talk about finding
these girls, if that's okay.

30:48.214 --> 30:49.714
So,
what we're trying to figure out

30:49.798 --> 30:53.673
is why Erin would lie to Dylan
about him being the father?

30:53.756 --> 30:56.172
Why not just tell him the truth?

30:56.255 --> 30:59.714
Because she always said how nice
his parents were to her.

31:00.381 --> 31:01.923
How they were good people.

31:03.255 --> 31:05.506
She liked the idea
of DJ always having

31:05.589 --> 31:08.714
that kind of love in his life,
you know?

31:08.798 --> 31:12.839
Did she talk about needing money
for ear surgery for DJ?

31:12.923 --> 31:16.339
Just that she wanted
Dylan to pay for it.

31:16.422 --> 31:18.881
But he kept telling her
he didn't have the money.

31:19.589 --> 31:20.673
-Mm-hmm.
-Did she say

31:20.756 --> 31:23.631
how she would get it
if Dylan couldn't pay for it?

31:33.130 --> 31:34.130
Jess.

31:35.464 --> 31:39.089
I understand you wanna
protect your friend, all right?

31:39.172 --> 31:40.506
That's admirable.

31:41.756 --> 31:43.673
But Erin's gone, sweetie.

31:43.756 --> 31:46.172
So the only person
you're helping by keeping silent

31:46.255 --> 31:47.673
is the person who killed her.

31:48.881 --> 31:51.422
Same person who might've
killed two more girls.

31:53.923 --> 31:54.964
Jess.

31:58.756 --> 32:01.381
Did she tell you
how she was planning

32:01.464 --> 32:03.673
on getting the money
for that ear surgery?

32:12.923 --> 32:15.923
She asked me
to create an account for her.

32:16.005 --> 32:17.506
She didn't wanna
make one at home

32:17.589 --> 32:20.047
'cause she didn't want her dad
to find out.

32:23.923 --> 32:26.339
Did you take those pictures,
sweetie?

32:29.589 --> 32:30.631
It's okay.

32:34.381 --> 32:35.464
Yeah.

32:36.964 --> 32:39.881
But... she was only gonna do it
for a little while

32:39.964 --> 32:42.339
until she saved up enough money
for the surgery.

32:42.422 --> 32:44.839
Do what? Have sex with men?

32:47.464 --> 32:49.756
Well, yeah. But she never did.

32:51.297 --> 32:53.130
No, she told me that

32:53.214 --> 32:55.839
she couldn't bring herself
to do it, you know.

32:55.923 --> 32:57.047
Jess.

32:58.214 --> 32:59.798
It's really important.

32:59.881 --> 33:03.297
Are you sure
she never once went out

33:03.381 --> 33:07.381
and met up with just, like,
even one of those guys

33:07.464 --> 33:09.381
-who messaged her?
-No, I'm sure.

33:13.255 --> 33:15.714
Okay. All right.

33:19.714 --> 33:22.381
Do you have the login
and password?

33:23.881 --> 33:24.923
Yeah.

33:33.923 --> 33:35.964
-Shit.
-What's the matter?

33:36.047 --> 33:38.589
I left my phone. Give me a sec.

33:50.214 --> 33:53.673
Hey, just, uh-- I had something
I forgot to ask.

33:53.756 --> 33:55.255
Sure. Jess?

33:56.255 --> 33:59.255
Jess, do you know
where she kept her journals?

34:02.339 --> 34:06.381
Uh, there's a dresser in--
in the corner of her room.

34:06.464 --> 34:09.297
And she keeps them in between
the two bottom drawers.

34:10.589 --> 34:12.756
Okay. Thanks. Thanks.

34:27.005 --> 34:28.923
Get a search warrant
over to Sidedoor

34:29.005 --> 34:31.714
with every username
that messaged Erin's account.

34:31.798 --> 34:33.255
They'll tell you
five business days.

34:33.339 --> 34:35.047
Tell them you need it
by tomorrow morning.

34:35.130 --> 34:39.464
-Yes, ma'am.
-Sorry. Old habits.

34:55.047 --> 34:57.255
What are you doing
Saturday night?

34:57.339 --> 35:00.089
Uh, this Saturday, I, uh...

35:00.172 --> 35:02.172
...have a friend's birthday.

35:03.673 --> 35:04.673
Okay.

35:06.589 --> 35:07.631
Why?

35:09.714 --> 35:13.589
No, just, uh... a buddy of mine
just opened a restaurant

35:13.673 --> 35:15.839
in Kennett Square,
and I've been meaning

35:15.923 --> 35:19.339
to check it out
for a while now, you know.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.547
Are you asking me
on a date, Zabel?

35:27.631 --> 35:30.339
I'm only asking
if the answer is yes.

36:11.297 --> 36:13.589
-You have a minute?
-Yeah, come in.

36:17.172 --> 36:19.714
Uh...

36:21.631 --> 36:24.089
A reporter from the Tribune
just called.

36:27.172 --> 36:30.005
He questioned me,
uh, about the circumstances

36:30.089 --> 36:32.798
of your transfer here
to St. Michael's.

36:32.881 --> 36:34.047
Well? What did you tell him?

36:34.130 --> 36:37.089
Uh, told him everything I knew.

36:38.881 --> 36:40.673
That I spoke with
the archdiocese at length

36:40.756 --> 36:42.089
before agreeing to the transfer.

36:43.130 --> 36:44.923
He's gonna write an article.

36:46.422 --> 36:49.089
Our parishioners
are gonna find out, Mark.

36:53.673 --> 36:56.214
-I...

36:57.673 --> 37:00.714
am responsible for protecting
the members of this parish.

37:00.798 --> 37:02.673
I don't know what else
you want me to say, Dan.

37:02.756 --> 37:04.422
I already told you
everything that happened.

37:04.506 --> 37:07.255
-Everything?
-Yes.

37:09.381 --> 37:11.506
Unless you don't believe me
anymore.

37:16.631 --> 37:19.297
Of course. Good night.

37:22.506 --> 37:23.673
Good night.

37:32.798 --> 37:35.297
Not me. Not me!

37:35.381 --> 37:36.923
Stop.

37:37.798 --> 37:40.255
-Stop!
-Oh, is this the documentary?

37:40.339 --> 37:42.923
-Yeah.
-Good smile.

37:43.005 --> 37:45.130
Oh, my God.
Kevin looks so happy there.

37:45.923 --> 37:47.339
So, you two were pretty close?

37:48.673 --> 37:52.297
Mm. Sometimes, I felt
like he was my best friend,

37:52.381 --> 37:56.631
and other times, I felt
like I didn't know him at all.

37:56.714 --> 37:59.547
Mm. Have you figured out
what you wanna say yet?

38:02.714 --> 38:07.172
I think it's my attempt
to try and understand

38:07.255 --> 38:09.172
-why he did it.
-Mm.

38:10.047 --> 38:11.464
It's not going very well.

38:11.547 --> 38:15.297
How did you all
get through that? Damn.

38:16.255 --> 38:19.839
We didn't. We fell apart.

38:23.881 --> 38:27.255
Is that why you wanna
stick around here for college?

38:27.964 --> 38:29.005
You're afraid if you leave,

38:29.089 --> 38:30.923
everything
will fall apart again?

38:33.839 --> 38:36.130
Don't live your life
for anyone else, Siobhan.

38:41.839 --> 38:44.047
Well, I'm making
a little progress.

38:44.547 --> 38:45.673
Yeah?

38:45.756 --> 38:49.589
I always wanted
to date an older woman, so...

38:49.673 --> 38:53.089
Oh. Well, actually, no,
that's bullshit.

38:53.172 --> 38:56.130
-I asked you out first.

39:32.714 --> 39:35.422
-I'll--

39:48.422 --> 39:49.631
-Hi, Helen.
-Hi.

39:49.714 --> 39:53.297
-Um, is Siobhan home?
-Oh, no, she went out.

39:54.339 --> 39:55.798
Could I come in for a sec?

39:58.589 --> 40:01.506
Yeah, sure.
Sure, yeah, come on in.

40:08.422 --> 40:12.172
Um... So, I--

40:12.255 --> 40:14.964
I guess you heard the news
that she broke up with me?

40:15.881 --> 40:17.756
It's all right, hon.

40:17.839 --> 40:22.047
I just don't-- I don't wanna
lose her, you know?

40:22.130 --> 40:23.964
She's like...

40:24.047 --> 40:26.881
...the one good thing I have
in my shitty fucking life.

40:28.214 --> 40:30.798
She's a very good person,
Siobhan.

40:30.881 --> 40:32.756
Yeah, she's fucking amazing.

40:32.839 --> 40:34.255
Sorry, she's--

40:34.339 --> 40:36.297
Yeah, she's, like,
really amazing, and I just--

40:36.381 --> 40:38.714
Yeah, I think
I just wanted to come here

40:38.798 --> 40:40.673
and let her know that.

40:40.756 --> 40:46.297
Oh, um... okay.
Uh, is she expecting you?

40:47.214 --> 40:48.339
Yeah, um...

40:48.422 --> 40:51.005
Yeah, she just texted
saying she was just out shopping

40:51.089 --> 40:52.589
and she'd be home
in a few minutes.

40:52.673 --> 40:55.089
Okay, well, uh,
Drew's asleep in his room,

40:55.172 --> 40:58.172
so, um, why don't you wait
in the basement?

41:08.756 --> 41:09.881
Uh, on the left.

41:09.964 --> 41:12.798
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

41:31.964 --> 41:34.047
I--

41:35.047 --> 41:37.339
-I had a really nice time.
-Me, too.

41:58.297 --> 41:59.422
Let's go inside.

42:42.756 --> 42:45.130
-Becca?

42:45.214 --> 42:47.464
Becca. Becca! Wait, Becca!

42:47.547 --> 42:49.255
No, no, no, no, no.

42:52.631 --> 42:54.339
God. I'm so sorry!

42:58.047 --> 43:00.255
Oh, my God. Gran? Gran?
Gran, are you okay?

43:00.339 --> 43:02.714
Can you-- can you
call an ambulance, please?

43:02.798 --> 43:04.756
-Can you hear me, Gran?

43:08.047 --> 43:12.255
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Jesus fucking Christ.

43:12.339 --> 43:13.547
What the hell?

43:15.923 --> 43:18.547
-Mom! Jesus.

43:19.756 --> 43:21.881
-Is that it?
-Is that it?

43:21.964 --> 43:23.422
Well, just-- Sorry, no.

43:23.506 --> 43:25.172
It's just the way
Siobhan sounded on the phone,

43:25.255 --> 43:27.923
-I assumed it'd be a lot worse.
-Well, I'm sorry
I'm not more maimed for you.

43:28.005 --> 43:29.547
Come on, get her out
of this thing, Eddie.

43:29.631 --> 43:31.130
She's got a papercut
on her forehead.

43:31.214 --> 43:33.547
She's disoriented, Mare.
Didn't know what year it was.

43:33.631 --> 43:35.422
Well, that's, you know,
nothing's new there.

43:35.506 --> 43:37.589
We're gonna take her
to Riddle to have her evaluated.

43:37.673 --> 43:40.631
-You wanna ride with her?
-Uh, I don't know. Sure.

43:40.714 --> 43:42.798
Mom, you want me
to ride with you?

43:44.422 --> 43:46.923
-Yeah.
-Okay.

43:47.005 --> 43:48.506
Mom, wait!

43:48.589 --> 43:50.631
Gran's asked for her purse.

43:51.214 --> 43:52.297
-Okay.
-Yeah.

43:52.381 --> 43:54.506
-You move the car, sweetie.
-Uh, yeah.

43:54.589 --> 43:58.881
-Who is that?
-Um, just-- just, uh, a friend.

44:00.214 --> 44:01.297
Hi, friend.

44:01.381 --> 44:02.798
-I'll call you later.
-Yeah.

44:02.881 --> 44:05.214
All right. Okay.

44:06.381 --> 44:08.506
-Who was that woman? Mom.
-Huh?

44:08.589 --> 44:10.506
Who was that woman with,
uh, Siobhan?

44:11.547 --> 44:14.839
It was-- it was Becca.

44:14.923 --> 44:16.547
No, that was not Becca.

44:34.881 --> 44:36.047
Hello?

44:36.130 --> 44:38.631
Katie's daughter's
middle name is Grace.

44:38.714 --> 44:41.047
She has a tattoo
of her birthday on her ankle.

44:41.964 --> 44:43.589
Do you believe me now, Dawn?

44:44.964 --> 44:46.589
-Yes.
-Good.

44:46.673 --> 44:50.255
Five thousand dollars
by tomorrow night.

44:50.339 --> 44:53.923
I'll call you with instructions
where to drop the money, Dawn.

44:54.005 --> 44:56.673
And if you go to the police,

44:56.756 --> 44:59.589
all you're ever gonna find
of Katie are her bones.

47:13.422 --> 47:16.881
News of another missing girl
has stoked fear in a community

47:16.964 --> 47:19.631
already reeling from the murder
of Erin McMenamin

47:19.714 --> 47:22.005
and the disappearance
of Katie Bailey.

47:22.089 --> 47:23.673
Twenty-three-year-old
Missy Sager,

47:23.756 --> 47:26.673
once a promising young graduate
of Sun Valley High,

47:26.756 --> 47:29.130
whose life has taken a dark turn
in recent years,

47:29.214 --> 47:32.005
left home on Thursday night
and has not returned since.

47:32.089 --> 47:34.172
-Hi.
-What are they saying now?

47:34.255 --> 47:36.923
...connected
to the disappearance
of Katie Bailey, or the death...

47:37.005 --> 47:38.798
Just everybody needs
to be careful, bud.

47:38.881 --> 47:40.464
Now police are saying...

47:40.547 --> 47:43.005
I don't want
you and Moira walking home
from school anymore, okay?

47:43.089 --> 47:44.923
Either me or Dad
will pick you up.

47:45.005 --> 47:46.214
Okay.

47:46.297 --> 47:48.506
...or has any
information regarding the case,

47:48.589 --> 47:51.005
to please contact them
immediately.

47:51.089 --> 47:53.547
Authorities have told us
that they are going to increase

47:53.631 --> 47:55.005
patrols in the township.

47:55.089 --> 47:56.714
In his press conference earlier,

47:56.798 --> 47:59.464
Easttown Police Chief Carter
didn't go as far as to say

47:59.547 --> 48:01.339
that all three cases
were linked,

48:01.422 --> 48:03.130
but he is still
encouraging residents

48:03.214 --> 48:07.047
to be vigilant in an effort
to prevent yet another tragedy.

48:18.005 --> 48:19.214
You all right?

48:19.297 --> 48:22.089
I'm supposed to check on you.
Doctor's orders.

48:22.172 --> 48:24.714
Make sure you're
not getting any worse. Are you?

48:24.798 --> 48:27.547
I don't feel any worse
then I usually do.

48:27.631 --> 48:29.714
Good enough for me.

48:29.798 --> 48:33.297
Oh, are you around
Saturday night to watch Drew?

48:34.881 --> 48:37.673
Should be. Why?

48:37.756 --> 48:41.506
-Uh, I have a date.
- The writer?

48:44.464 --> 48:47.339
I don't know yet. Night.

48:49.631 --> 48:50.881
What's that mean?

49:16.047 --> 49:19.547
All right.
The babysitter is here.

49:19.631 --> 49:21.422
Well, thanks
for helping me out, Bethy.

49:21.506 --> 49:23.964
Any time. Any time.
I even bought pizza

49:24.047 --> 49:26.464
-in case you're hungry, Kenz.
-Ooh, pizza, Kenz.

49:26.547 --> 49:29.381
My shift ends at midnight, Beth.
Thank you.

49:30.881 --> 49:32.589
-Be good, Kenzie.
-Be right back, honey.

49:35.047 --> 49:38.255
-Hello?

49:38.339 --> 49:39.923
Get on the turnpike.

49:43.839 --> 49:47.673
Take the State Road 903 exit.

49:51.005 --> 49:53.422
Make a left at Harlan Road.

49:53.506 --> 49:55.422
Head west for three miles.

50:01.422 --> 50:02.547
You'll see a wooden fence

50:02.631 --> 50:04.255
marking the edge
of the property.

50:05.923 --> 50:07.214
There's a home there.

50:09.255 --> 50:11.130
You'll find Katie
in the basement.

51:55.881 --> 51:59.255
Shit. Oh, shit.

51:59.339 --> 52:02.214
-Shit.

52:07.172 --> 52:08.297
Shit!

52:13.005 --> 52:15.255
Fuck!

52:17.047 --> 52:18.214
Freddie?

52:19.172 --> 52:20.506
Sorry, Dawn.

52:20.589 --> 52:22.756
Fuckin' sorry.

53:01.547 --> 53:04.673
I told you to sleep in my bed.

53:04.756 --> 53:07.130
-Yeah, I tried that, but I--

53:08.547 --> 53:10.214
Oh, my God.

53:10.297 --> 53:12.964
-Oh, my God. What happened?
-I'm fine.

53:13.047 --> 53:15.673
I just took a little spill
outside of the store.

53:15.756 --> 53:18.172
Oh, my God, we--
Do you need to go see a doctor?

53:18.255 --> 53:19.547
No, no, I'm fine.

53:19.631 --> 53:21.214
Just let me sit down
for a minute.

53:21.297 --> 53:22.673
Well, can I get you some--

53:22.756 --> 53:24.923
Let me get you some water
or something.

53:25.339 --> 53:26.422
Thanks.

53:35.464 --> 53:40.839
It's just the radiation.
I feel dizzy all the time.

53:40.923 --> 53:45.297
-Oh, I didn't know that.
-Mm-hmm.

53:45.881 --> 53:46.923
Here.

53:51.422 --> 53:54.047
Are you sure you don't want me
to take you to the hospital?

53:54.130 --> 53:55.881
-'Cause--
-Bethy...

53:55.964 --> 53:58.673
-I'm fine.
-Honey, you don't look fine.

53:59.798 --> 54:00.839
I'm fine.

54:02.005 --> 54:03.255
Okay.

54:07.881 --> 54:11.547
Did you ever call the police
about that person who--

54:11.631 --> 54:14.089
who called and said they knew
where Katie was?

54:16.506 --> 54:17.506
Yeah.

54:18.381 --> 54:21.297
Yeah. They agreed with you.

54:21.381 --> 54:23.464
And they say
it was probably some scammer

54:23.547 --> 54:24.964
looking to make some money.

54:25.673 --> 54:29.506
Yeah. I'm sorry.

54:31.130 --> 54:32.172
Uh...

54:33.339 --> 54:38.172
It's okay. It's okay. I'm okay.
Thanks, Bethy.

54:40.339 --> 54:41.839
Thank you.

54:57.381 --> 55:02.130
No! No! No!

55:02.214 --> 55:05.714
No!

55:08.881 --> 55:11.381
Hey!

55:14.714 --> 55:16.214
Hey!

55:19.756 --> 55:21.673
No one can hear you in here.

55:26.714 --> 55:28.714
Who are you?

55:29.714 --> 55:32.714
I'm Katie. Katie Bailey.

57:41.964 --> 57:43.130
So what can I do for you, Mare?

57:43.214 --> 57:44.339
Two more girls are gone.

57:44.673 --> 57:46.756
Please just ask around,
see if anyone suspicious

57:46.839 --> 57:49.089
been on the streets
trying to pick 'em up?

57:49.172 --> 57:50.214
Yeah, yeah, sure.

57:50.964 --> 57:52.297
I brought you a gift basket.

57:52.381 --> 57:55.255
Hoagies from Laspadas,
cheesesteaks from Coco's...

57:56.047 --> 57:59.005
I know you like her.
I see the way you look at her.

57:59.255 --> 58:02.506
Mare, uh...
I'm showing you all of my cards.

58:02.839 --> 58:04.464
And you are showing me none.

58:04.547 --> 58:05.881
I'm trying to help you out here.

58:06.130 --> 58:07.047
Help me?

58:07.339 --> 58:08.297
Or help yourself?

58:09.631 --> 58:11.673
That's that priest
I was telling you's about.

58:12.047 --> 58:15.422
Hey Father, I hear you got
yourself a little altar girl.

58:15.506 --> 58:18.255
Yo, I'm talking to you,
you pedophile punk!

58:22.381 --> 58:24.089
You remember
anything about the vehicle?

58:24.172 --> 58:25.506
What can you tell us about him?

58:26.172 --> 58:27.756
He smoked Winstons.

58:27.839 --> 58:29.047
Mare.

58:33.047 --> 58:35.130
I can feel it happening again.

58:35.464 --> 58:38.964
Like panic, because expectation
from people would be something

58:39.214 --> 58:41.798
I don't think
I'm good enough to be.

58:42.673 --> 58:45.255
Maybe you could be my mom
for a second?

58:45.506 --> 58:46.422
What's going on?

58:46.756 --> 58:48.673
I didn't know
when you asked me before.

58:49.089 --> 58:50.547
I swear I didn't know.

58:50.923 --> 58:51.881
What didn't you know?

58:52.714 --> 58:54.089
What'd you
say to that detective?

58:54.172 --> 58:55.214
Nothing.

58:55.297 --> 58:57.714
The three of us.
We're joined together forever.

58:57.923 --> 59:00.005
So why don't you
get in the car?!
