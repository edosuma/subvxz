led your own department

to represent a family member...

08:52.434 --> 08:54.234
But she's the best defense attorney I know.

08:54.235 --> 08:56.170
I tried going with an outside firm.

08:56.171 --> 08:57.571

09:56.931 --> 09:58.298
I had it analyzed already.

09:58.299 --> 10:00.734
Oh, that was quick.

10:00.735 --> 10:03.737
It's a mix of sialic and hydrofluoric acid.

10:03.738 --> 10:05.239

10:05.240 --> 10:08.342

10:26.494 --> 10:28.595
He went home with a succubus, remember?

10:28.596 --> 10:30.197
Guy gets around.

10:30.198 --> 10:32.466
Oh! He mentioned, uh,

10:32.467 --> 10:34.301
the guy who brokered the deal... McKenna.

10:34.302 --> 10:35.502
Yeah, he's a local fence.

10:35.503 --> 10:38.172
His front is a pawnshop in town.

10:38.173 --> 10:40.140
We need to pay him a visit
and see what he knows.

10:40.141 --> 10:41.642
And the archives?

10:41.643 --> 10:43.377
Hawley clearly took something of value.

10:43.378 --> 10:45.446
Finding it should lead to finding him.

10:45.447 --> 10:46.896
Yeah, but we don't want to lose McKenna.

10:46.897 --> 10:49.174
This mess'll still be
here when we get back.

10:49.951 --> 10:52.987
Well, then, in the words
of Philip II of Macedon...

10:52.988 --> 10:55.723
"Divide ET impera."

10:55.724 --> 10:58.125

Hmm, that's a good plan.

10:58.126 --> 10:59.560

10:59.561 --> 11:01.495

11:16.511 --> 11:18.579
So, I take it you and
Crane still haven't talked.

11:18.580 --> 11:19.713
You were there.

11:19.714 --> 11:21.248
We worked it out.

11:21.249 --> 11:22.549
"Divide and conquer."

11:22.550 --> 11:24.251
You really think you two

11:24.252 --> 11:25.986
work better apart than together?

11:25.987 --> 11:28.689
Look, he's trying to figure out

11:28.690 --> 11:30.824
his relationship with his witch
wife while they're mourning

11:30.825 --> 11:33.027
their Horseman-of-War
son's death,

11:33.028 --> 11:35.095
which I'm guessing is pretty complicated.

11:35.096 --> 11:39.433
So I am not gonna sweat the small stuff.

11:39.434 --> 11:41.835

Sheriff's Department.

11:50.445 --> 11:51.579
How about you tell me

11:51.580 --> 11:54.260
who paid you to set up Nick Hawley?

11:55.283 --> 11:56.917
No idea what you're talking about, ma'am.

11:56.918 --> 11:59.053
Okay. Let's go. Precinct.

11:59.054 --> 12:01.255
I'm sure I can find a
violation or two around here.

12:01.256 --> 12:03.857
Unless you have prints
and IDs for every item?

12:03.858 --> 12:05.559
Come on, you bring me downtown,

12:05.560 --> 12:06.927
I'm still not gonna talk.

12:06.928 --> 12:09.963
And you've just wasted a day on paperwork.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.134
What is this... good cop, bad cop?

12:14.135 --> 12:15.769
I'm not a cop.

12:15.770 --> 12:17.137
Aah!

12:17.138 --> 12:18.572
Did you see that, Abbie?

12:18.573 --> 12:20.574
This guy just tried to assault me!

12:20.575 --> 12:22.610
What's that? Ten years given his priors?

12:22.611 --> 12:23.811
It was a woman.

12:23.812 --> 12:25.145
I don't know her name.

12:25.146 --> 12:27.648
Aah! Okay! Carmilla.

12:27.649 --> 12:29.850
Carmilla Pines.

12:34.155 --> 12:35.389
And you delivered Hawley to her?

12:35.390 --> 12:36.423
- If anything happens to him...
- Okay.

12:36.424 --> 12:39.260
Okay. Who is Carmilla Pines?

12:39.261 --> 12:40.494
She's a treasure hunter.

12:40.495 --> 12:41.962
But not like Hawley.

12:41.963 --> 12:45.032
She's dangerous. A killer.

12:46.601 --> 12:49.803
And she turns the task
into a leisure activity

12:49.804 --> 12:52.406
with a rather lively ditty.

12:52.407 --> 12:55.342
So, she sings, she cleans, she...

12:55.343 --> 12:57.544
travels by parasol...

12:59.748 --> 13:01.348
A modern witch specializing in housework.

13:01.349 --> 13:03.450
It hardly sounds progressive.

13:03.451 --> 13:04.685
Oh, no, no.

13:04.686 --> 13:07.321
Miss Poppins seems quite fulfilled.

13:14.696 --> 13:17.932
What is it?

13:17.933 --> 13:20.100
This charm...

13:20.101 --> 13:22.369
is a duplicate of the Halo Blade

13:22.370 --> 13:25.305
wielded by the angel Orion.

13:26.975 --> 13:29.610
That sigil is a beacon.

13:29.611 --> 13:31.211
Used to call upon an angel.

13:31.212 --> 13:32.980
Miss Mills must have received it from him

13:32.981 --> 13:36.517
and... kept it from me.

13:36.518 --> 13:38.719
As she did

13:38.720 --> 13:41.221
when she first allied herself with him.

13:41.222 --> 13:42.489
Got a name

13:42.490 --> 13:43.958
on our vetala.

13:43.959 --> 13:45.960
Carmilla Pines,

13:45.961 --> 13:47.962
notorious treasure hunter.

13:47.963 --> 13:51.065
And Hawley's legal guardian from 12 to 18.

13:51.066 --> 13:53.567
So, Mr. Hawley was raised by a criminal

13:53.568 --> 13:55.569
who is also a monster?

13:55.570 --> 13:58.973
I believe I have discovered
what Carmilla is after.

13:58.974 --> 14:01.242
Hawley filched architectural designs

14:01.243 --> 14:04.044
- belonging to Henry Knox.
- As in Fort Knox?

14:04.045 --> 14:05.646
Well, before they named a fort after him,

14:05.647 --> 14:07.514
he was a revolutionary hero.

14:07.515 --> 14:09.750
Built a home nearby used to safeguard

14:09.751 --> 14:12.353
weapons and supplies from the British.

14:12.354 --> 14:14.255
And now Hawley has the blueprints.

14:14.256 --> 14:16.857
Knox had a singular obsession...

14:16.858 --> 14:19.360
locks and puzzles.

14:19.361 --> 14:21.428
He built

14:21.429 --> 14:24.164
the vault in his estate
with the Sons of Liberty,

14:24.165 --> 14:26.166
a Boston spy ring, to ensure

14:26.167 --> 14:28.369
that the colonists' weapons

14:28.370 --> 14:30.571
were protected to the upmost security.

14:30.572 --> 14:34.108
The contents in Knox's vault
were considered very dangerous.

14:34.109 --> 14:35.175
They still are.

14:35.176 --> 14:36.577
The estate belongs to his heir now.

14:36.578 --> 14:39.013
I've heard of him. Theodore Knox?

14:39.014 --> 14:40.281
He collects black market

14:40.282 --> 14:41.615
antiques and weapons.

14:41.616 --> 14:43.884
Rumor is he has an entire storehouse

14:43.885 --> 14:45.686
of occult items at his place.

14:45.687 --> 14:47.421
So, whatever Carmilla's
after in the vault...

14:47.422 --> 14:50.424
Is something we dare not let her have.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.460
Original architectural designs

14:53.461 --> 14:54.962
from the Knox estate.

14:54.963 --> 14:59.033
Direct from a 1775 Sons of Liberty folio.

14:59.034 --> 15:00.301
Now, this symbol in the corner

15:00.302 --> 15:02.136
represents a lever lock system.

15:02.137 --> 15:04.605
Its tumblers for the vault... they run

15:04.606 --> 15:06.273
through the walls of the entire house,

15:06.274 --> 15:08.576
making the house like a fortress.

15:08.577 --> 15:10.444
One big safe.

15:10.445 --> 15:13.447
And this is how you crack it.

15:13.448 --> 15:15.783
Impressive, Nicky.

15:18.720 --> 15:21.088
Who were those people in the tunnels?

15:21.089 --> 15:22.256
Don't worry about them.

15:22.257 --> 15:23.591
I did what you asked.

15:23.592 --> 15:25.226
Now, tell me:

15:25.227 --> 15:26.293
what the hell happened to you?

15:26.294 --> 15:28.662
It was after you ran off...

15:28.663 --> 15:30.331
I ran because I saw you murder someone.

15:30.332 --> 15:32.499
And that was before you were whatever

15:32.500 --> 15:33.500
the hell you are now.

15:33.501 --> 15:36.670
I tried to protect you.

15:36.671 --> 15:38.505
- You ran.
- I saw you.

15:38.506 --> 15:41.175
The way you killed him, Carmilla.

15:41.176 --> 15:42.443
That wasn't the first time.

15:42.444 --> 15:44.245
How could I have stayed?

15:44.246 --> 15:46.146
I came looking for you, you know?

15:46.147 --> 15:48.415
Tracked you to Mumbai.

15:48.416 --> 15:51.285
But I got caught by a Thuggee death cult.

15:51.286 --> 15:54.922
And they turned me into this... thing.

15:54.923 --> 15:56.990
Don't put this on me.

15:58.093 --> 16:02.062
This is what they did to me.

16:05.934 --> 16:07.434
It's the mark of the vetala.

16:14.142 --> 16:16.210
When I got wind that you were here,

16:16.211 --> 16:18.946
I left you alone.

16:18.947 --> 16:21.048
I didn't want to burden you with this.

16:21.049 --> 16:23.217
But Knox has an artifact

16:23.218 --> 16:26.220
that could give me back my life.

16:26.221 --> 16:27.988
I got you the blueprints.

16:27.989 --> 16:30.291
You're on your own for the rest.

16:30.292 --> 16:32.293
Did you hear me?

16:32.294 --> 16:34.495
I'm the only family you have left.

16:34.496 --> 16:38.365
The artifact in Knox's vault
will make me human again.

16:38.366 --> 16:40.033
Look at me.

16:41.236 --> 16:43.671
Help me.

16:43.672 --> 16:46.673
One last time.

16:53.148 --> 16:55.916
One and done.

16:57.652 --> 17:00.254
"One and done."

17:10.022 --> 17:11.858
You enjoying yourself, Speed Racer?

17:11.858 --> 17:13.358
It's my first time driving a car

17:13.359 --> 17:15.328
with real horsepower. Can you blame me?

17:15.329 --> 17:16.996
Oh, and on the subject.

17:16.997 --> 17:18.865
Is said power referring to a horse

17:18.866 --> 17:22.635
of Arabian, Turkoman or Barb breeding?

17:22.636 --> 17:24.002
There is a difference.

17:24.003 --> 17:25.438
Whichever horse is fastest.

17:25.439 --> 17:26.973
Knox's swap meet started an hour ago.

17:26.973 --> 17:28.508
If you scratch Hawley's car,

17:28.509 --> 17:30.209
serves him right.

17:30.210 --> 17:34.147
How did Mr. Hawley come to
be raised by Carmilla Pines?

17:34.148 --> 17:35.882
When he was 12,

17:35.883 --> 17:38.351
a few days before Christmas,
his parents died in an accident.

17:38.352 --> 17:39.819
She was his godmother.

17:39.820 --> 17:41.721
He always described her as this kind of

17:41.722 --> 17:43.289
- female Indiana Jones type.
- She couldn't

17:43.290 --> 17:46.058
- have been a vetala then.
- Something happened between them.

17:46.059 --> 17:47.693
It seemed like he really missed her.

17:47.694 --> 17:49.529
But you know Hawley. He
never talked about it.

17:49.530 --> 17:51.464
Are we certain this
Carmilla will strike tonight?

17:51.465 --> 17:52.965
Knox holds these

17:52.966 --> 17:55.301
black market exchanges
a couple times a year.

17:55.302 --> 17:57.970
It's the perfect distraction
for Carmilla to make her move.

17:57.971 --> 18:00.907
An unusual crowd, loose guest list.

18:00.908 --> 18:03.009
To Knox, it's not who you
are, it's what you have.

18:03.010 --> 18:06.345
So these... are our invitations.

18:06.346 --> 18:07.647
When Carmilla arrives on the property,

18:07.648 --> 18:09.081
she will make her way to the vault.

18:09.082 --> 18:10.750
Unless she's waiting for a specific time.

18:10.751 --> 18:11.984
We need to surveil the place first.

18:11.985 --> 18:13.853
And at all costs,

18:13.854 --> 18:16.622
we must stay together.

18:27.701 --> 18:30.369
Talk to me.

18:30.370 --> 18:33.773
It's the only way we're
gonna make it through this.

18:36.043 --> 18:38.678
Okay.

18:38.679 --> 18:41.047
You were dead, Frank.

18:41.048 --> 18:43.616
We saw where you were buried.

18:43.617 --> 18:46.252
We put flowers on your grave.

18:46.253 --> 18:48.287
We mourned you.

18:48.288 --> 18:51.124
And now you're here and you're
sleeping next to me again?

18:51.125 --> 18:53.359
I just...

18:53.360 --> 18:56.229
I just need to know if it's really you.

18:56.230 --> 18:58.965
You think Henry still has
some sort of hold on my soul?

18:58.966 --> 19:01.134
I don't know.

19:01.135 --> 19:02.301
But I'm scared, Frank.

19:02.302 --> 19:03.302
We're supposed to pick up Macey

19:03.303 --> 19:05.972
tomorrow from my parents, but

19:05.973 --> 19:08.741
I need to know for sure
that my husband's back.

19:08.742 --> 19:10.777
What do you want me to do?

19:10.778 --> 19:12.979
I don't have

19:12.980 --> 19:15.281
an explanation for this.

19:15.282 --> 19:18.151
Only the fact that I am alive.

19:18.152 --> 19:20.453
Remember what Abbie said?

19:20.454 --> 19:22.255
At the precinct?

19:22.256 --> 19:25.892
I know Abbie and Crane aren't
your favorite people right now.

19:25.893 --> 19:30.596
But Abbie told me Katrina could help us.

19:32.332 --> 19:34.167
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen...

19:34.168 --> 19:36.602
I don't know if I said this before, but

19:36.603 --> 19:38.638
thank you, Nicky.

19:38.639 --> 19:41.073
Hey. I'm here for you.

19:42.576 --> 19:45.111
This job is no different from the others.

19:45.112 --> 19:47.113
Knox is an overweight,

19:47.114 --> 19:49.582
entitled black market thief.

19:49.583 --> 19:53.653
We're just stealing
what was already stolen.

20:03.263 --> 20:06.199
There's Knox with the belly dancers.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.267
See right there?

20:08.268 --> 20:10.970
Carmilla and Hawley.

20:15.676 --> 20:17.043
We can't lose them.

20:17.044 --> 20:18.945
Jenny, you take Hawley.

20:18.946 --> 20:20.479
Crane and I will take Carmilla.

20:28.489 --> 20:30.189
Excuse me.

20:30.190 --> 20:32.158
That's, uh, quite the bow you've got there.

20:32.159 --> 20:34.527
Black walnut stock, forged

20:34.528 --> 20:36.729
medieval limbs.

20:37.898 --> 20:39.232
I'd say late 15th century.

20:39.233 --> 20:40.500
Thank you.

20:40.501 --> 20:41.667
Uh, Teddy Knox.

20:41.668 --> 20:43.703
- Huh?
- Of course you are.

20:43.704 --> 20:45.738
The resemblance is uncanny.

20:45.739 --> 20:49.075
Uh, I've seen images of your ancestors.

20:49.076 --> 20:50.476
- Excuse me.
- Uh...

20:50.477 --> 20:52.178
how can you just wear it like that?

20:52.179 --> 20:54.046
Linen with patriot blue...

20:54.047 --> 20:55.014
- Crane?
- ...facing.

20:55.015 --> 20:56.749
Ah, late 18th century,

20:56.750 --> 20:58.050
mint condition...

21:19.740 --> 21:21.907
Okay.

22:02.583 --> 22:04.784
Thank you, Sons of Liberty.

22:14.394 --> 22:15.795
So your aunt's a monster.

22:15.796 --> 22:17.730
Mills.

22:17.731 --> 22:19.932
Damn it, I told you before,
you got to get out of here.

22:19.933 --> 22:21.134
What is Carmilla stealing from Knox?

22:21.135 --> 22:22.735
I don't ask questions

22:22.736 --> 22:24.470
when I don't want to know the answers.

22:24.471 --> 22:26.239
That's not good enough
for me, and I thought

22:26.240 --> 22:27.340
you were better than that, too.

22:27.341 --> 22:29.008
It's like you said... she's a monster.

22:29.009 --> 22:31.410
I don't have a lot of other options.

22:31.411 --> 22:32.678
You have us.

22:32.679 --> 22:33.946
We can fight her.

22:33.947 --> 22:36.649
I'm not gonna let you say no.

22:37.918 --> 22:39.518
Okay, fine, come on, quick.

22:44.758 --> 22:46.325
I'm trying to help you!

22:46.326 --> 22:48.161
I know, Mills, and thank you,

22:48.162 --> 22:50.096
but for your own good, stay out of this.

23:41.382 --> 23:42.815
Lieutenant?!

23:44.885 --> 23:46.386
Unhand her.

23:46.387 --> 23:48.020
Now.

23:53.260 --> 23:56.796
You shoot, she dies.

24:04.789 --> 24:06.156
No!

24:06.157 --> 24:08.558
Don't! Stop!

24:08.559 --> 24:09.693
Hey.

24:09.694 --> 24:10.827
We got what you wanted.

24:10.828 --> 24:11.962
Let's go.

24:11.963 --> 24:13.463
This one is police.

24:13.464 --> 24:15.232
Harm her,

24:15.233 --> 24:16.733
and you will seal your fate.

24:16.734 --> 24:19.636
There's another way to do this.

24:19.637 --> 24:21.204
You let them live,

24:21.205 --> 24:22.873
they promise not to come after you...

24:24.175 --> 24:25.475
...and I'll stay.

24:25.476 --> 24:26.910
I'll stay with you.

24:29.314 --> 24:30.714
Hawley, what are you doing?

24:30.715 --> 24:32.583
There are three of us and one of her.

24:32.584 --> 24:34.585
It's not gonna work like that.

24:34.586 --> 24:37.321
Carmilla, you taught me to
make deals, not mistakes.

24:37.322 --> 24:39.189
I don't trust them.

24:40.491 --> 24:42.492
We lock them in the vault.

24:42.493 --> 24:44.061
Knox comes by in a day or so,

24:44.062 --> 24:47.264
but by then we'll be
halfway across the globe.

24:47.265 --> 24:48.665
Mr. Hawley.

24:48.666 --> 24:50.734
When we first met, I considered you

24:50.735 --> 24:53.570
nothing but a faithless privateer.

24:53.571 --> 24:55.772
But I have come to know
you as a man of courage.

24:55.773 --> 24:57.107
A man of compassion.

24:58.443 --> 25:00.977
A man who fights for his friends.

25:07.585 --> 25:10.320
Maybe you had it right the first time.

25:13.391 --> 25:14.791
We have a deal?

25:14.792 --> 25:17.060
Deal.

25:21.799 --> 25:23.267
Hawley, don't do this.

25:23.268 --> 25:24.801
I'll make sure Knox knows you're in here.

25:24.802 --> 25:25.903
We're coming after you.

25:25.904 --> 25:27.104
Don't.

25:27.105 --> 25:28.305
I mean that.

25:33.645 --> 25:35.646
We need a way out of here.

25:35.647 --> 25:37.648
Can we contact Miss Jenny?

25:37.649 --> 25:40.651
Not without cell service.

25:40.652 --> 25:43.654
Not to add to our stresses,

25:43.655 --> 25:45.756
but I recognize the statue Carmilla stole.

25:45.757 --> 25:49.159
The Bajrayogini Statue of Kali.

25:49.160 --> 25:51.161
Yeah, I saw it, too, in
the Hindu book of lore.

25:51.162 --> 25:52.262
It's one of a kind.

25:52.263 --> 25:54.665
And also the key

25:54.666 --> 25:57.968
to a dark ceremony that
turns humans into vetalas.

25:57.969 --> 25:59.470
How did we end up here anyway?

25:59.471 --> 26:01.472
We were bush-league upstairs.

26:01.473 --> 26:03.474
You went after Carmilla without me.

26:03.475 --> 26:05.242
I thought you were going to wait.

26:05.243 --> 26:08.245
I thought you were signaling
me to follow her and move on.

26:08.246 --> 26:10.247
That was the plan.

26:10.248 --> 26:14.251
I thought the plan was
for us to stick together.

26:14.252 --> 26:16.587
Clearly, our signals were crossed.

26:16.588 --> 26:19.156
Another failure of
communication to add to our list.

26:19.157 --> 26:21.837
What is that supposed to mean?

26:24.162 --> 26:27.831
Well, it means the roster
of our missteps is growing

26:27.832 --> 26:29.833
to karaoke catalog-sized proportions.

26:29.834 --> 26:31.668
Does this have anything to do

26:31.669 --> 26:34.671
with me not mentioning the
silent alarm in the archives?

26:34.672 --> 26:36.673
An excellent idea.

26:36.674 --> 26:38.375
As was taking the toxins to the lab.

26:38.376 --> 26:39.777
Yeah, I didn't intend to keep it from you;

26:39.778 --> 26:41.011
we're just moving fast.

26:41.012 --> 26:43.714
Agreed, and neither require my consent.

26:43.715 --> 26:45.949
But I cannot help but wonder

26:45.950 --> 26:49.086
why you did not share
with me Orion's sigil.

26:51.189 --> 26:54.725
We should pause this discussion
until we have found a way out.

26:54.726 --> 26:56.727
I've developed rather a distaste

26:56.728 --> 26:58.929
for being cramped in small spaces.

27:02.333 --> 27:05.535
You were a real hero to
your friends back there.

27:06.671 --> 27:09.391
Well, I meant what I said.

27:12.544 --> 27:16.413
Look, whatever you become,
it doesn't change the fact

27:16.414 --> 27:18.148
that you took me in when I had no one.

27:18.149 --> 27:19.983
I shouldn't have left.

27:19.984 --> 27:21.218
I know that now.

27:21.219 --> 27:23.899
I owed you better than that.

27:28.727 --> 27:30.894
I wish I could believe you.

27:30.895 --> 27:32.863
I truly do.

27:32.864 --> 27:34.064
No...

27:41.272 --> 27:42.773
This whole thing's a con.

27:47.112 --> 27:49.947
You won't abandon me again, Nicky.

27:49.948 --> 27:52.950
We were family.

27:52.951 --> 27:54.952
And thanks to the goddess Kali,

27:54.953 --> 27:57.154
we will be again.

28:04.896 --> 28:06.897
Knox would have built an exit.

28:06.898 --> 28:10.901
A fail-safe in case he
locked himself inside.

28:10.902 --> 28:12.542
Hmm...

28:15.707 --> 28:17.308
The Liberty Tree.

28:17.309 --> 28:21.945
The Sons of Liberty used
this symbol, which may...

28:25.317 --> 28:27.251
Aha.

28:27.252 --> 28:29.987
Huh.

28:29.988 --> 28:32.990
Knobs.

28:32.991 --> 28:36.994
These must control the hinges.

28:36.995 --> 28:39.329
But how are they...?

28:40.432 --> 28:42.833
All right.

28:42.834 --> 28:47.071
Each knob is marked with
an alchemical symbol.

28:47.072 --> 28:50.074
Push the correct knob, the door will open.

28:50.075 --> 28:52.076
We don't know which one that is.

28:52.077 --> 28:54.078
If we choose wrong...

28:54.079 --> 28:56.347
Then I doubt we leave the vault alive.

28:56.348 --> 28:59.316
Quandary, indeed.

28:59.317 --> 29:01.919
About the sigil,

29:01.920 --> 29:03.921
I should have told you.

29:03.922 --> 29:06.757
Orion gave it to me, I used it to find him.

29:06.758 --> 29:09.760
Felt like bringing it up after the fact

29:09.761 --> 29:11.995
was opening a can of worms.

29:14.766 --> 29:17.301
I thought it was over.

29:18.537 --> 29:20.170
So did I.

29:23.375 --> 29:27.378
Okay, you are by no means
the only one responsible.

29:27.379 --> 29:32.015
I decided Abraham was worthy of
saving without consulting you.

29:36.788 --> 29:40.991
Perhaps we both decided it
was easier to act than to talk.

29:42.794 --> 29:44.795
Yeah.

29:44.796 --> 29:48.799
These problems have always
resolved themselves in the past.

29:48.800 --> 29:52.803
What if this is indicative
of something larger?

29:52.804 --> 29:56.373
What if we're not as good partners today

29:56.374 --> 29:58.809
as we were in the past?

29:58.810 --> 30:01.490
Maybe our whole thing
has started to go awry.

30:03.815 --> 30:07.017
Even in the times of great peril...

30:08.820 --> 30:11.021
...we could always rely on one another.

30:13.825 --> 30:16.827
But in the past few weeks,

30:16.828 --> 30:19.396
today,

30:19.397 --> 30:22.599
I have felt our bond sorely tested.

30:29.407 --> 30:31.408
Are you having a moment?

30:31.409 --> 30:33.410
I believe I am.

30:33.411 --> 30:36.847
The thought of testing a bond.

30:36.848 --> 30:39.850
During the war, Henry Knox's
greatest achievement was

30:39.851 --> 30:42.420
stealing British cannons from Ticonderoga.

30:42.421 --> 30:45.101
Cannons that were bonded...

30:46.425 --> 30:48.626
...in iron.

30:50.929 --> 30:53.130
Oh, my.

31:01.473 --> 31:03.474
One time you're wrong.

31:03.475 --> 31:06.155
What are the damn odds?

31:17.095 --> 31:18.795
I'll admit... I was excited,

31:18.796 --> 31:20.297
I may have acted rashly.

31:20.298 --> 31:22.099
I'll make sure to put
that on your tombstone.

31:22.100 --> 31:23.600
I'm not gonna die in Knox's vault,

31:23.601 --> 31:25.068
even if it goes all...

31:25.069 --> 31:27.304
Star Wars trash compactor on us.

31:27.305 --> 31:29.373
Star Wars? What did they use?

31:29.374 --> 31:30.807
They had a robot.

31:30.808 --> 31:33.910
Ah.

31:33.911 --> 31:36.213
You knew Knox better than anyone.

31:36.214 --> 31:38.081
Which of these chemicals
would he have picked?

31:38.082 --> 31:39.883
Knox was a student of alchemy.
He could've found reason

31:39.884 --> 31:41.385
to choose any one of these chemicals.

31:41.386 --> 31:43.987
Forget about the war hero and the student.

31:43.988 --> 31:45.389
What did the man love?

31:45.390 --> 31:46.990
Uh-uh, gambling.

31:46.991 --> 31:48.792
Cards, horse racing, he was addicted.

31:48.793 --> 31:50.794
He died penniless trying to
line his pockets with gold.

31:50.795 --> 31:52.162
Gold!

31:52.163 --> 31:53.430
Gold.

32:07.945 --> 32:09.846
We seriously named Fort Knox

32:09.847 --> 32:11.615
after a dude who died in debt.

32:11.616 --> 32:14.684
Well, he had other redeeming qualities.

32:20.625 --> 32:22.993
Abbie.

32:22.994 --> 32:24.161
Where were you?

32:24.162 --> 32:26.363
Hawley locked me in a closet.

32:26.364 --> 32:27.864
He locked us in a death trap.

32:27.865 --> 32:29.266
I'm gonna kick his ass.

32:29.267 --> 32:30.534
Where's Carmilla?

32:30.535 --> 32:32.369
She left with a Hindu statue.

32:32.370 --> 32:33.971
That can turn people into vetalas.

32:33.972 --> 32:35.439
I think one vetala's enough.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.341
Yes, which is why we need to find her.

32:37.342 --> 32:39.276
Hawley stole my cell phone.

32:39.277 --> 32:40.844
Ten bucks says he still has it.

32:40.845 --> 32:42.679
Which means we can track it.

32:57.962 --> 32:59.963
It's not exactly the Ritz-Carlton.

32:59.964 --> 33:01.632
I'll do a sweep of the perimeter,

33:01.633 --> 33:03.753
see how many guys we're up against.

33:06.137 --> 33:08.005
We need to find a way to defeat Carmilla

33:08.006 --> 33:09.406
once and for all.

33:09.407 --> 33:11.074
We need to find that statue.

33:11.075 --> 33:12.843
The statue.

33:12.844 --> 33:14.745
Of course.

33:14.746 --> 33:16.713
Kali has six hands,

33:16.714 --> 33:18.081
four of them holding items

33:18.082 --> 33:20.017
and two of them in specific positions.

33:20.018 --> 33:21.652
Mudras.

33:21.653 --> 33:22.920
The symbolic language of gesture

33:22.921 --> 33:24.488
in Hinduism and Buddhism.

33:24.489 --> 33:26.990
Thank you, yoga class.

33:26.991 --> 33:28.692
I'm still not going back.

33:28.693 --> 33:31.261
So, the top left hand

33:31.262 --> 33:33.330
was positioned like this.

33:33.331 --> 33:35.365
Privthi.

33:35.366 --> 33:36.934
The symbol of life.

33:36.935 --> 33:40.337
And the right hand, Tarjani.

33:40.338 --> 33:42.539
The symbol for destruction.

33:43.708 --> 33:45.442
The bottom two hands on the right arms

33:45.443 --> 33:47.244
had a torch and an iron stone.

33:47.245 --> 33:48.745
There it is.

33:48.746 --> 33:50.614
Carmilla fled the tunnels

33:50.615 --> 33:52.516
because of the open flame on your torch

33:52.517 --> 33:54.851
and the iron tips to these bolts.

33:54.852 --> 33:57.092
We can kill her with iron and fire.

34:34.559 --> 34:37.728
The statue works.

34:37.728 --> 34:39.129
Carmilla, please,

34:39.130 --> 34:40.664
think about what you're doing.

34:40.665 --> 34:43.166
You once told me I made
you a better person.

34:43.167 --> 34:45.601
I'm not a person anymore, Nicky.

34:45.603 --> 34:48.572
I know it's hard for you to see now.

34:48.572 --> 34:51.007
But you'll thank me later.

34:51.009 --> 34:52.641
Shh.

34:54.746 --> 34:57.481
Oh, you're gonna love death, Nicky.

35:05.455 --> 35:09.224
Soon, the last of Kali's
tears will be wept.

35:09.225 --> 35:12.961
Then the statue will take
us through the final journey.

35:16.633 --> 35:18.734
Step away from him!

36:39.082 --> 36:40.615
Come on.

37:08.344 --> 37:10.079
Nicky.

37:10.080 --> 37:11.480
You can't.

37:11.481 --> 37:13.482
I'm sorry.

37:52.856 --> 37:54.523
Oh.

37:54.524 --> 37:57.526
So, this is the welcome I get from now on.

38:00.497 --> 38:02.698
Can't say I blame you.

38:05.402 --> 38:07.469
You come bearing gifts?

38:07.470 --> 38:10.772
Well, friends don't
steal from friends, right?

38:13.209 --> 38:15.644
Look, Jenny,

38:15.645 --> 38:18.080
now you know why I...

38:18.081 --> 38:19.715
keep my distance.

38:19.716 --> 38:22.551
I get it.

38:22.552 --> 38:23.819
She was your family.

38:23.820 --> 38:25.654
But you also have a family

38:25.655 --> 38:27.856
here in Sleepy Hollow.

38:27.857 --> 38:30.726
You know that, right?

38:30.727 --> 38:32.928
Thank you.

38:33.930 --> 38:36.398
I mean that.

38:39.836 --> 38:41.904
You're leaving, aren't you?

38:41.905 --> 38:45.040
Mills, I put you in danger.

38:45.041 --> 38:47.176
Betrayed your trust.

38:47.177 --> 38:49.345
I, uh,

38:49.346 --> 38:50.746
I can't be here.

38:50.747 --> 38:53.549
I'm gonna hunt her down.

38:53.550 --> 38:55.117
You know,

38:55.118 --> 38:56.685
I'd ask you to come with me.

38:56.686 --> 38:58.253
Except you know what I'd say.

39:21.478 --> 39:23.612
So, what happened when
we were in the vault?

39:23.613 --> 39:25.748
Are we good?

39:25.749 --> 39:26.982
We are.

39:26.983 --> 39:28.283
We are far greater

39:28.284 --> 39:29.752
than the sum of our parts,

39:29.753 --> 39:33.422
but we cannot rely on our bond to last

39:33.423 --> 39:36.058
unless we tend to it.

39:36.059 --> 39:37.926
Damn straight. That's why

39:37.927 --> 39:39.395
I thought it's time we do a duet.

39:39.396 --> 39:42.231
Next up is Abbie and Ichabod.

39:42.232 --> 39:44.667
- Lieutenant, you learned my shanty.
- Mm.

39:44.668 --> 39:46.235
No, the song's called "Proud Mary,"

39:46.236 --> 39:47.403
but you can do it.

39:47.404 --> 39:48.671
You just killed a vetala.

39:48.672 --> 39:51.173
You can handle a little rock and roll.

39:51.174 --> 39:53.976
Come on.

40:31.214 --> 40:33.449
This ceremony

40:33.450 --> 40:35.618
will dig into the very
fabric of your being,

40:35.619 --> 40:38.187
which may be unpleasant

40:38.188 --> 40:39.722
and dangerous.

40:39.723 --> 40:41.990
It might be best if you stood back.

40:47.631 --> 40:49.832
I just want my family to know that I'm free

40:49.833 --> 40:52.034
and clear of Henry's influence.

40:57.374 --> 40:58.874
Where is Henry?

40:58.875 --> 41:01.310
Excuse me?

41:01.311 --> 41:03.178
The fact that you are here in the flesh

41:03.179 --> 41:06.348
tells me that my son is still alive.

41:06.349 --> 41:07.983
Where is he?

41:07.984 --> 41:11.386
I have no idea what you're talking about.

41:53.763 --> 41:56.232
Whatever magic bound you
to the Horseman of War

41:56.233 --> 41:58.067
is gone.

42:01.137 --> 42:03.739
I cannot say how you came back to life,

42:03.740 --> 42:07.543
only that my son has no
influence on your soul.

42:07.544 --> 42:10.312
I think we got ourselves a miracle.

42:24.394 --> 42:25.961
Promise me,

42:25.962 --> 42:28.397
this is the start of a
new chapter of our lives.

42:28.398 --> 42:30.132
Oh, baby.

42:30.133 --> 42:32.067
I guarantee it.
