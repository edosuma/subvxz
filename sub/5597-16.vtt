WEBVTT

00:04.519 --> 00:08.106
I've been saving this scotch for
someone who'd appreciate it.

00:08.622 --> 00:10.423
Patient gave it to me a few months back.

00:10.425 --> 00:13.759
I, uh, saved his leg, and he kills my liver.

00:13.761 --> 00:16.294
Macrury 25...
that must've been some leg.

00:17.130 --> 00:18.229
Alex, you want in?

00:18.231 --> 00:19.598
Mm, think I'll stick with my wine,

00:19.600 --> 00:22.834
but, uh, I'll raise a glass.

00:22.836 --> 00:25.837
SlÃ inte mhath...
to your good health.

00:26.907 --> 00:28.306
We should be drinking to yours.

00:35.181 --> 00:36.247
Surgery's next week?

00:36.249 --> 00:38.116
Yeah. Tuesday.

00:38.118 --> 00:40.118
How you feel about it?

00:41.920 --> 00:43.788
Good.

00:43.790 --> 00:47.292
Yeah, no point stressing what
you can't control, right?

00:47.294 --> 00:48.826
There's nothing to worry about.

00:48.828 --> 00:50.527
It's a small tumor. It's benign.

00:50.529 --> 00:53.363
He has Shahir as his neurosurgeon, so...

00:53.365 --> 00:56.067
It's not the first time he's cut
my brain open, either, so...

00:56.069 --> 00:57.258
No worries.

00:57.522 --> 00:58.903
No worries.

01:00.872 --> 01:02.206
It's late.

01:02.208 --> 01:04.941
I'm gonna turn in, okay?

01:04.944 --> 01:09.580
Don't stay up too late.

01:09.582 --> 01:11.415
- Night.
- Night.

01:12.883 --> 01:14.151
Want to see
if that game's still on?

01:14.153 --> 01:15.652
- Yes, I do.
- All right.

01:15.654 --> 01:18.455
- Bring that bottle.
- Yeah.

01:22.060 --> 01:23.827
Well, looks good, Shahir.

01:23.829 --> 01:26.730
You've, uh, carried
most the research on your own.

01:26.732 --> 01:28.464
Sorry to be such a silent partner.

01:28.466 --> 01:29.766
Nah, you've been an immense help.

01:29.768 --> 01:31.234
I'll be ready to present the results

01:31.236 --> 01:32.535
of my toramex study next month.

01:32.537 --> 01:34.437
So, tuesday's coming up fast, huh?

01:34.439 --> 01:35.739
Tuesday?

01:35.741 --> 01:39.008
Yeah. You know, my surgery
that you're performing.

01:39.010 --> 01:41.544
Of course. Tuesday... 8:00 A.M.

01:41.546 --> 01:43.146
Mm-hmm.
Still feeling confident?

01:43.148 --> 01:44.780
Absolutely.

01:44.782 --> 01:46.984
You know, I know this
procedure inside and out,

01:47.034 --> 01:49.585
plus the mortality rate is less than 8%...

01:49.587 --> 01:51.120
even with an average surgeon.

01:51.122 --> 01:53.322
Yeah, well, there was a 10%
chance of rain last week

01:53.324 --> 01:54.590
and I still got wet, so...

01:54.592 --> 01:56.358
Well, meteorology's a reactive science.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.426
I'm looking for
a little pep talk here, Shahir.

01:58.428 --> 02:00.863
Mm-hmm.

02:00.865 --> 02:03.598
Well, I have a nearly
flawless surgical record.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.301
Plus, I'm personally
invested in the outcome...

02:06.303 --> 02:08.103
because we're friends...

02:08.104 --> 02:11.106
Which, theoretically,
complicates things, but still...

02:11.108 --> 02:12.707
nothing to worry about.

02:12.709 --> 02:14.042
Nothing to worry about.

02:14.044 --> 02:17.546
And I've got a consult in the ICU.

02:17.548 --> 02:19.881
Good talk, Shahir. Lots of pep.

02:19.883 --> 02:21.349
Definitely.

02:21.351 --> 02:22.551
Good talk.

02:22.553 --> 02:25.019
Dr. Sekara, you rang?

02:25.021 --> 02:28.222
Mr. Morrison here has a dislocated shoulder.

02:28.224 --> 02:30.424
He's here from
a long-term care facility?

02:30.426 --> 02:33.094
Been there since
a massive stroke 15 years ago.

02:33.096 --> 02:35.863
There was an accident yesterday
changing his bedding.

02:35.865 --> 02:37.598
He, uh, fell to the floor.

02:37.600 --> 02:38.666
Okay.

02:38.668 --> 02:42.469
Dr. Harris,
Max has locked-in syndrome.

02:42.471 --> 02:45.406
Apparently, it took his
doctors some time to realize

02:45.408 --> 02:47.641
that he wasn't in a vegetative state.

02:47.643 --> 02:50.211
Uh, wait a second.

02:50.213 --> 02:53.113
So he was trapped in there,

02:53.115 --> 02:55.249
fully conscious but unable
to speak for how long?

02:55.251 --> 02:56.383
Three years.

02:56.385 --> 02:57.518
Wow.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.386
- I can't even imagine.
- No, me neither.

02:59.388 --> 03:02.055
He has regained some ocular
motor functions since then.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.256
Now he can blink...

03:03.258 --> 03:05.558
once for "yes" and twice for "no."

03:05.560 --> 03:07.560
Okay, thanks.

03:11.165 --> 03:13.266
Um...

03:13.268 --> 03:14.667
Mr. Morrison.

03:14.669 --> 03:18.304
Max, I'm, uh, I'm Dr. Harris.

03:18.306 --> 03:19.505
Can you, uh, can you hear me?

03:20.642 --> 03:22.074
Good.

03:22.076 --> 03:24.577
Well, very nice to meet you.
I'm here to fix your shoulder.

03:24.579 --> 03:28.013
So, I understand they've
given you some pain meds,

03:28.015 --> 03:31.016
so hopefully
you won't feel this, but...

03:31.018 --> 03:35.888
if you do, just, uh,
blink twice for me, okay?

03:35.890 --> 03:37.189
How you doing, Max?

03:40.493 --> 03:42.027
Hey.

03:50.203 --> 03:51.803
Huh.

03:51.805 --> 03:53.972
Great. Thank you.

03:58.611 --> 04:02.781
Um, c-can you get one more?

04:04.000 --> 04:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:12.425 --> 04:15.059
Hey.

04:15.061 --> 04:16.894
Dr. Miller, what can I do for you?

04:16.897 --> 04:17.995
Brought you a coffee.

04:17.998 --> 04:19.130
Is it black?

04:19.132 --> 04:20.197
Of course it is.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.166
Thank you.

04:22.502 --> 04:25.035
Mind if I ask what you're doing
sitting here among strangers

04:25.037 --> 04:26.437
when you have your own office

04:26.439 --> 04:28.939
and don't care much for strangers?

04:28.941 --> 04:31.509
They've hit a delay with the painting.

04:31.511 --> 04:33.411
I can't decide on a color.

04:33.715 --> 04:35.046
Really?

04:35.096 --> 04:37.335
How hard is that?
Off-white. Boom, you're done.

04:37.700 --> 04:39.780
Off-white is not a productive color.

04:39.830 --> 04:40.789
Oh.

04:40.882 --> 04:42.452
There you go.
I didn't know there were productive colors.

04:42.454 --> 04:44.587
How about... yellow?

04:44.589 --> 04:46.190
Yellow brings out antipathy in people,

04:46.192 --> 04:48.425
which, as chief of surgery,
I already have an abundance.

04:48.427 --> 04:49.860
Hmm.

04:53.365 --> 04:55.598
Cardiac case in the E.R.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.334
All right, well, let's go together.

04:57.336 --> 04:59.836
We'll have a color picked
out by the time we're there.

04:59.838 --> 05:02.205
I can't breathe!

05:02.207 --> 05:04.207
I can't breathe!

05:04.209 --> 05:05.308
Jackson, what do we got?

05:05.310 --> 05:06.743
Simon Wesley. He's got a pacemaker.

05:06.745 --> 05:08.678
Came in complaining of
dizziness and chest pains.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.947
We got him hooked to the ECG.
You really need to see this.

05:10.949 --> 05:13.049
All right. Stay calm, sir.
You're gonna be just fine.

05:13.051 --> 05:14.483
Heart rate's all over the place here.

05:14.485 --> 05:15.409
Jackson, get me a magnet

05:15.459 --> 05:16.551
- and some pacing pads.
- You got it.

05:16.554 --> 05:17.854
We got a runaway pacemaker.

05:17.856 --> 05:20.022
It's dangerously
accelerating his heart rate.

05:20.024 --> 05:20.977
Not having a heart attack,

05:21.027 --> 05:22.305
but the machine that's pacing his heart is.

05:22.355 --> 05:23.226
Let's get some oxygen.

05:23.228 --> 05:25.194
It's probably an older model.

05:25.196 --> 05:26.395
Okay.

05:28.733 --> 05:30.332
Okay, he is pacemaker-dependent.

05:30.334 --> 05:32.234
Let's get these pads on.

05:37.106 --> 05:38.374
And...

05:38.376 --> 05:39.174
Clear.

05:48.535 --> 05:49.890
Okay. Pads are keeping him in rhythm.

05:49.940 --> 05:51.844
Okay, this is gonna take the sting off.

05:51.846 --> 05:53.846
You must feel like a
rechargeable battery right now.

05:54.371 --> 05:56.982
We need to get him upstairs
so can interrogate the device.

05:56.985 --> 05:59.852
Where is the microfilm?

06:00.254 --> 06:02.456
Simon, Dr. Bell is gonna get you upstairs

06:02.458 --> 06:04.323
and, uh, check some data on your pacemaker.

06:04.325 --> 06:05.357
You know,

06:05.359 --> 06:07.347
this shouldn't even be happening again.

06:07.398 --> 06:08.661
I turned my whole life around.

06:08.663 --> 06:09.862
Just relax, Simon.

06:09.864 --> 06:11.564
Once we get you upstairs
and have a closer look,

06:11.566 --> 06:12.899
we'll know a lot more.

06:12.901 --> 06:14.266
You know, I was thinking some more.

06:14.268 --> 06:15.534
Uh, how about green?

06:15.536 --> 06:17.804
Everybody loves
good old hospital-scrubs green.

06:17.806 --> 06:18.972
Not everybody...

06:18.974 --> 06:20.539
actually, no one, but thank you.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.013
Dr. Lin, you got a sec?

06:28.015 --> 06:29.915
Yeah.

06:35.860 --> 06:37.979
So, uh...

06:38.832 --> 06:40.625
so I met someone.

06:40.627 --> 06:43.528
Okay. Why do you look so miserable?

06:43.530 --> 06:46.764
Last night, I took her
home for the first time.

06:46.766 --> 06:50.034
I'll spare you the details, but...

06:50.036 --> 06:51.469
It was great.

06:51.471 --> 06:52.953
It was great. It was really great.

06:53.003 --> 06:55.297
Okay, that's starting to
sound a lot like details.

06:55.347 --> 06:57.733
But then,
right at the end... bam.

06:57.844 --> 06:58.832
Bam?

06:58.882 --> 06:59.852
Like... like someone ran in

06:59.902 --> 07:01.713
and brained me with a baseball bat.

07:01.715 --> 07:04.449
My head exploded, and...
and I ended up on the ground,

07:04.451 --> 07:06.183
- screaming in pain.
- Oh, my god.

07:06.185 --> 07:07.485
And then she starts freaking out,

07:07.487 --> 07:09.153
and the neighbor's
pounding on the door and...

07:11.924 --> 07:13.324
the whole thing was just a nightmare.

07:17.095 --> 07:19.930
I think something popped in my brain.

07:19.932 --> 07:21.598
While you were...

07:21.600 --> 07:22.900
Yeah.

07:24.002 --> 07:26.936
Okay. I think you need to talk to Dr.
Hamza right away.

07:26.938 --> 07:29.439
No, no, no, no. No Shahir. No one else.

07:29.441 --> 07:30.907
I don't trust the others... only you.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.209
Really? You trust me that much?

07:33.211 --> 07:34.944
'Cause I got dirt on you.

07:34.946 --> 07:38.281
In that case, I will be right back.

07:44.288 --> 07:45.288
Charlie.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.156
Oh, hey. You look tired.

07:47.158 --> 07:48.758
Well, I should not have
had that last scotch...

07:48.760 --> 07:52.228
and then not got into a two-hour
conversation with my wife.

07:52.230 --> 07:53.562
Oh, you drunk-dialed.

07:53.564 --> 07:55.631
She dialed. Not drunk.

07:55.633 --> 07:57.100
Thought all that was over with.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.368
Not on paper.

07:58.370 --> 08:00.403
Plus, we still have the house in L.A.,

08:00.405 --> 08:01.804
which, as it turns out,

08:01.806 --> 08:03.406
is a harder thing
to get out of than a marriage.

08:03.408 --> 08:06.876
But, as of today,
it finally goes on the market.

08:06.878 --> 08:08.010
Anyways...

08:08.012 --> 08:10.012
thank you both for dinner last night.

08:10.014 --> 08:12.615
Look, I'm sorry
if I soured the mood with Alex.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.483
She seems nervous about the surgery.

08:14.485 --> 08:16.484
Yeah, I think it just, uh...

08:16.486 --> 08:18.853
brings up some bad memories for both of us.

08:18.855 --> 08:20.722
Well, look...

08:20.724 --> 08:22.757
Anything goes wrong,
you know I'll be there for her.

08:24.593 --> 08:26.161
Not there, there.

08:26.163 --> 08:28.797
You know what I mean. Idiot.

08:28.799 --> 08:29.965
Dr. Bishop.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.634
Serena.

08:32.635 --> 08:34.168
Anyway, it's all gonna be good, Charlie.

08:34.169 --> 08:35.904
You got nothing to worry about.

08:41.208 --> 08:43.578
Max?

08:47.215 --> 08:49.750
Maybe you should come with me.

09:10.572 --> 09:13.841
So, bet you got a lot to say.

09:15.677 --> 09:17.043
Yeah.

09:17.045 --> 09:19.279
See, I was stuck in a coma for almost a year

09:19.281 --> 09:22.482
and I almost lost my marbles.

09:22.484 --> 09:26.353
You've been stuck in there all this time,

09:26.355 --> 09:28.688
unable to speak.

09:28.690 --> 09:29.956
Bet you got a lot on your mind.

09:35.363 --> 09:38.230
Look, I know you haven't
spoken to anyone in 15 years.

09:38.232 --> 09:40.566
Can't be easy.

09:47.040 --> 09:48.641
We were slacklining at the park.

09:48.643 --> 09:50.175
She pitched off into a park bench.

09:50.177 --> 09:51.410
It was totally my bad.

09:51.412 --> 09:52.478
I shouldn't have put the
line so close to it.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.079
- I'm fine, really.
- Here you go.

09:54.081 --> 09:56.015
Am I the only one who doesn't
know what slacklining is?

09:56.017 --> 09:57.516
It's kind of like tightrope walking,

09:57.518 --> 09:59.118
except the line's a lot less rigid

09:59.120 --> 10:00.886
and we stay pretty close to the ground.

10:00.888 --> 10:03.222
I need to have a look.

10:03.224 --> 10:05.891
Can you lift up your shirt, please?

10:05.893 --> 10:07.292
Wow.

10:07.294 --> 10:08.527
Must've been quite a fall.

10:08.529 --> 10:10.862
It didn't really hurt, no.

10:10.864 --> 10:12.230
But it does now.

10:12.232 --> 10:13.765
Just a little.

10:13.767 --> 10:15.500
Did you, uh, hit your head when you fell?

10:15.502 --> 10:18.036
Nah, I saw the whole thing.
It was just her stomach.

10:18.038 --> 10:19.938
My poor baby girl.

10:19.940 --> 10:22.741
She's so tough, she didn't
want to come to the hospital.

10:22.743 --> 10:26.344
We're supposed to be, uh,
going on our honeymoon tomorrow...

10:26.346 --> 10:27.645
Niagara falls.

10:27.647 --> 10:28.546
You're married.

10:28.548 --> 10:30.248
Three days ago, city hall.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.417
Well, congratulations. Wow, you guys are...

10:32.419 --> 10:34.752
Young. Yeah, we know. I don't know.

10:34.754 --> 10:37.055
Chase thinks people just
wait too long these days.

10:37.057 --> 10:38.989
I don't want to wait until
I'm in my 30s to have kids

10:38.991 --> 10:40.458
I'm too old to play with them, you know?

10:40.460 --> 10:42.660
Uh-huh.

10:42.662 --> 10:45.228
Uh, Georgia, are you on any medications?

10:45.230 --> 10:46.496
No.

10:46.498 --> 10:49.900
I did have a couple drinks,
though, before I fell...

10:49.902 --> 10:52.335
just in case that makes a difference.

10:52.337 --> 10:55.105
That's definitely good to know.

10:56.208 --> 10:58.709
Okay, we can take those pads off now.

11:00.644 --> 11:01.644
All right, Simon.

11:01.646 --> 11:02.712
You're on transvenous,

11:02.714 --> 11:04.414
so that will keep your heart beating

11:04.416 --> 11:06.783
while we determine what's
wrong with your pacemaker.

11:06.785 --> 11:08.618
How long have you had it?

11:08.620 --> 11:11.354
Um, almost 10 years.

11:11.356 --> 11:13.690
My heart rate was dangerously low.

11:13.692 --> 11:16.793
I was seriously overweight.

11:16.795 --> 11:19.095
Always short of breath.

11:19.097 --> 11:20.162
You seem fit now.

11:20.164 --> 11:22.031
You must've made some lifestyle changes.

11:22.033 --> 11:25.201
Yeah. You could say that.

11:25.203 --> 11:28.004
I was in a horrible marriage.
I was depressed.

11:28.006 --> 11:30.039
One day, I collapsed in the supermarket...

11:30.041 --> 11:31.407
the ice-cream aisle.

11:31.409 --> 11:33.476
I call that my rocky-road bottom.

11:33.478 --> 11:35.944
Simon, if you don't mind my asking...

11:35.946 --> 11:38.547
what, uh, happened with your marriage?

11:38.549 --> 11:40.716
We divorced. She moved away.

11:40.718 --> 11:42.017
We're both happier now.

11:42.019 --> 11:43.051
Huh.

11:43.053 --> 11:46.222
So you're divorced. So are you.

11:46.224 --> 11:48.457
Any advice for someone
about to go down that road?

11:48.459 --> 11:50.391
Get through it as quickly as possible.

11:50.393 --> 11:52.293
Don't let your emotions get involved.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.129
Don't let my emotions get involved

11:54.131 --> 11:55.964
in the dissolution of my marriage.

11:55.966 --> 11:58.634
Well, don't waste time moping around.

11:58.636 --> 11:59.835
Get out there.

11:59.837 --> 12:01.569
I met someone at crossfit.

12:01.571 --> 12:04.973
We're supposed to do a
triathlon together next month.

12:04.975 --> 12:08.510
Don't count yourself out
of that race just yet.

12:08.512 --> 12:09.544
All right.

12:09.546 --> 12:10.945
The interrogator's ready.

12:10.947 --> 12:13.014
Okay, let's see what your
pacemaker has to say.

12:13.016 --> 12:14.415
Pausing the transvenous.

12:15.752 --> 12:18.386
Mm, generator and the leads
are badly deteriorated.

12:18.388 --> 12:20.488
Probably should've followed up, huh?

12:20.490 --> 12:22.323
Okay, well, the pacing will
keep your heart beating,

12:22.325 --> 12:23.858
but we need to take a more permanent step.

12:23.860 --> 12:25.993
You're getting in a shiny, new pacemaker.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.494
You'll be like a teenager again,

12:27.496 --> 12:30.865
by which I mean your heart will
be sending texts all the time.

12:30.867 --> 12:32.667
We will get you a consent form,

12:32.669 --> 12:33.934
but we need to act now,

12:33.936 --> 12:36.436
so if there's anybody
that you need to call...

12:36.438 --> 12:39.906
F.A.S.T. looks clear.

12:39.908 --> 12:42.576
Oh. Did you hurt your ribs, too?

12:42.578 --> 12:45.212
Uh, no, I fe... I fell off my bike last week.

12:45.214 --> 12:46.547
Klutz of the month, I guess.

12:47.650 --> 12:48.649
The beautiful princess Klutz.

12:48.651 --> 12:50.083
Yeah.

12:50.085 --> 12:52.152
Um, could you scooch out of the
way for me for a sec? Yeah.

12:52.154 --> 12:54.521
Oh, sorry.
Just, actually, to the front.

12:54.523 --> 12:56.990
Sorry. Thank you.

12:59.026 --> 13:00.093
Hey.

13:08.468 --> 13:10.070
Could you excuse us both for a second?

13:10.072 --> 13:11.838
We'll be right back.

13:15.108 --> 13:16.475
There was a failed
domestic violence campaign

13:16.477 --> 13:17.476
a few months back.

13:17.478 --> 13:18.911
the black dot was supposed to signal

13:18.913 --> 13:20.979
that the person was in
an abusive relationship.

13:20.981 --> 13:22.748
Domestic abuse reporting is a gray area...

13:22.750 --> 13:24.083
even when there's hard proof.

13:24.085 --> 13:25.251
What we have is not that.

13:25.253 --> 13:26.485
All of the signals are there.

13:26.487 --> 13:27.553
He does all the talking.

13:27.555 --> 13:29.554
He cuts her off when she tries to speak.

13:29.556 --> 13:31.090
We need more than a pen mark.

13:31.526 --> 13:33.692
The F.A.S.T. was clear, so...

13:33.694 --> 13:35.660
let's order some more tests just to be sure.

13:35.662 --> 13:39.431
Separate them, then we find
out what's really going on.

13:51.187 --> 13:52.367
Georgia.

13:52.542 --> 13:54.094
Sorry, docs.

13:54.096 --> 13:55.696
Newlyweds... you know how it is.

13:55.698 --> 13:58.899
So, we'd love to send you on your honeymoon,

13:58.901 --> 14:01.435
but we need to be cautious
with abdominal injuries.

14:01.437 --> 14:03.637
Yes, with the blunt trauma,

14:03.639 --> 14:05.906
I'm concerned that you may
develop a liver hematoma,

14:05.908 --> 14:07.641
which could be serious if it ruptures.

14:07.643 --> 14:08.776
What are you saying?

14:08.778 --> 14:10.410
We're saying that we need to take Georgia

14:10.412 --> 14:11.744
for some more detailed imaging.

14:12.273 --> 14:14.081
I think we should go.

14:14.083 --> 14:16.149
- We should go, Chase. I'm fine, really.
- Yeah.

14:16.151 --> 14:17.817
It's all right. It's all right.

14:17.819 --> 14:19.786
Chase, just stay here
for a couple of minutes.

14:19.788 --> 14:21.521
We're gonna take her for some pictures.

14:21.523 --> 14:23.390
You want me to come with?

14:23.392 --> 14:25.658
She gets freaked out in hospitals.

14:25.660 --> 14:27.126
We'll go together, okay?

14:29.597 --> 14:31.731
15 blade.

14:41.475 --> 14:43.376
Okay. And removing the pacemaker.

14:46.946 --> 14:48.314
There we go.

14:50.217 --> 14:52.151
Okay. Time to expose these leads.

14:52.153 --> 14:53.252
Pickup and metz, please.

14:54.854 --> 14:58.124
Dr. Bishop, comments, concerns?

15:00.827 --> 15:02.327
Sorry.

15:02.329 --> 15:05.330
My mind was, uh, somewhere else.

15:05.332 --> 15:06.932
Our house is going on the market today.

15:06.934 --> 15:08.934
Mm, I can see why you're distracted.

15:10.469 --> 15:12.037
You and Natasha live there a while?

15:12.039 --> 15:13.972
Four years.

15:13.974 --> 15:16.807
You know, a house,
it's just four walls and a roof.

15:16.809 --> 15:18.643
I don't know... it's also that weekend

15:18.645 --> 15:21.879
we went furniture shopping in Echo Park...

15:21.881 --> 15:23.781
the painting we bought when she was drunk

15:23.783 --> 15:26.851
after she finished her residency...

15:26.853 --> 15:28.386
the bed we had to fix one morning...

15:28.388 --> 15:31.156
Okay, that'll do. 11 blade.

15:31.158 --> 15:32.424
I know it's over.

15:32.426 --> 15:34.358
It's just this house thing
is really bringing it...

15:34.360 --> 15:36.293
Home?

15:36.295 --> 15:38.128
Yeah.

15:38.130 --> 15:40.998
"He who rejects change is
the architect of decay."

15:41.000 --> 15:43.534
Just because it hurts
doesn't make it a bad thing.

15:43.536 --> 15:45.670
Well, how about you?
You seeing anyone lately?

15:45.672 --> 15:48.505
Mm, I'm still facing my
old boyfriend in court.

15:50.007 --> 15:51.975
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

15:51.977 --> 15:54.278
It's fine.

15:54.280 --> 15:55.679
There's a lot of scar tissue here.

15:58.183 --> 16:01.685
Dawn, just, uh, heard back
from your patient's partner.

16:01.687 --> 16:02.586
He's on his way up.

16:02.588 --> 16:04.020
He?

16:04.022 --> 16:06.456
Oh. Simon really did start a new life.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.393
Thank you, Zach, for, uh, coming up.

16:10.395 --> 16:12.596
You didn't need to do that.
You could've just sent a text.

16:12.598 --> 16:14.464
I was just walking by.

16:14.466 --> 16:16.232
Thought I'd let you know.

16:24.242 --> 16:27.610
Okay, this isn't working.
we need to try something else.

16:32.282 --> 16:33.716
Hey.

16:34.651 --> 16:38.321
So, was the pain pre-orgasmic
or post-orgasmic?

16:38.323 --> 16:39.588
Are you serious?

16:39.590 --> 16:42.457
I'm your doctor right now,
not your friend, okay?

16:42.459 --> 16:45.527
Sort of in between those things.

16:45.529 --> 16:47.796
Okay. And you had neck pain?

16:47.798 --> 16:49.231
Oh, yeah.

16:49.233 --> 16:50.298
Nausea?

16:50.300 --> 16:51.767
Felt like I was gonna puke.

16:51.769 --> 16:54.169
And it was a headache
unlike any you've ever had?

16:54.171 --> 16:57.038
Don't think anyone's ever had
a headache like this before.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.508
Hence the screaming.

16:59.510 --> 17:01.909
Things were going really well with Maria.

17:01.911 --> 17:03.711
Like, I really liked her.

17:03.713 --> 17:05.747
You don't know that it's past tense.

17:05.749 --> 17:06.914
Trust me.

17:06.915 --> 17:09.083
After what happened last night

17:09.085 --> 17:10.852
I'm never gonna see her again.

17:10.854 --> 17:12.286
Okay.

17:12.288 --> 17:14.656
Get yourself to the MRI,
and then we'll see what's what.

17:14.657 --> 17:15.757
All right?

17:15.759 --> 17:18.992
Dr. Lin, what if
I'll never have sex again?

17:18.994 --> 17:20.426
Like, what if I've got an aneurysm

17:20.429 --> 17:22.396
that's just gonna blow up
in the back of my head?

17:22.397 --> 17:26.567
Get yourself to imaging,
and then we'll talk, okay?

17:26.569 --> 17:29.836
Oh, and, uh, Jackson...

17:32.674 --> 17:34.375
No?

17:34.377 --> 17:36.410
Fine.

17:42.551 --> 17:43.717
Max, you in there?

17:48.656 --> 17:50.724
So you can just come and go as you please?

17:51.926 --> 17:53.994
And no one else has ever seen you?

17:55.629 --> 17:59.700
Hi. How's he doing?

17:59.702 --> 18:03.336
I'm one of Max's nurses at Silver Oaks.

18:03.338 --> 18:04.304
Yvonne.

18:04.306 --> 18:06.506
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:06.508 --> 18:09.742
I tore a strip off the
orderly that let him fall.

18:09.744 --> 18:12.579
It won't happen again.

18:12.581 --> 18:14.380
How long have you cared for Max?

18:14.382 --> 18:16.282
Oh, about 12 years.

18:16.284 --> 18:19.651
I try to keep him healthy and entertained.

18:19.653 --> 18:20.853
Before me, they would just

18:20.855 --> 18:22.454
sit him in front of the daytime soaps.

18:23.149 --> 18:24.778
He hated that.

18:25.426 --> 18:27.927
Sounds like Max is lucky to have you.

18:29.130 --> 18:32.564
Oh, Max is not without his own charms.

18:34.168 --> 18:36.635
I'd, um...

18:36.637 --> 18:40.772
I'd like to spend the day with him,
if that's all right.

18:40.774 --> 18:43.675
See, the thing is, uh...

18:43.677 --> 18:47.212
I'm gonna be moving out west for a job

18:47.214 --> 18:49.715
and, um...

18:49.717 --> 18:53.151
Max and I have spent a lot of time together,

18:53.153 --> 18:55.220
and I'd just like to say goodbye.

19:06.933 --> 19:10.167
Georgia, it's time
to take you for your scan.

19:10.169 --> 19:11.502
Oh, are these bruises on your leg

19:11.504 --> 19:12.970
from the bike crash or the fall today?

19:12.972 --> 19:14.805
It's from the bike, right?

19:14.807 --> 19:16.240
Usually when we ask a patient a question

19:16.242 --> 19:17.708
it's 'cause we want the patient to answer.

19:17.710 --> 19:19.477
Hey, I'm just trying to help out.

19:19.479 --> 19:21.312
Yeah, they're from the bike.

19:21.314 --> 19:23.814
Okay, Dr. Williams, will you
take Georgia for her scan now?

19:23.816 --> 19:25.115
Yeah.

19:25.984 --> 19:27.084
Chase...

19:27.086 --> 19:28.819
The C.T. only fits one.

19:28.821 --> 19:30.520
So why don't you stay with me for a second?

19:30.522 --> 19:31.822
We can talk.

19:31.824 --> 19:33.323
Sounds a little ominous.

19:33.325 --> 19:35.859
Not at all.
Why don't I buy you a coffee?

19:41.332 --> 19:43.933
Max, you're upset.

19:46.404 --> 19:48.938
Is it because Yvonne's leaving?

19:51.175 --> 19:54.110
Is it because you love her...

19:54.112 --> 19:56.413
And you've never been able to tell her?

19:58.548 --> 20:00.082
That must be hard.

20:02.886 --> 20:04.753
Not as hard
as all those years you spent

20:04.755 --> 20:06.555
before anyone knew you were
conscious, though, right?

20:11.161 --> 20:13.729
I wanted to die.

20:15.699 --> 20:16.998
What about now?

20:18.802 --> 20:19.835
No.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.171
No, I don't, because of her.

20:25.809 --> 20:27.943
And now she's leaving me.

20:30.046 --> 20:32.013
Curve snap.

20:34.151 --> 20:38.053
Okay, I'm gonna gently
try to pull the lead out.

20:38.055 --> 20:41.957
Dr. Bishop, give me a bit of space, please.

20:41.959 --> 20:44.226
Come on.

20:44.228 --> 20:45.894
There we go.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.662
And it's...

20:47.664 --> 20:48.563
Out.

20:48.565 --> 20:49.664
Okay, that's great.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.599
Whoa! B.P. just went south.

20:51.601 --> 20:52.600
Whoa, that's a lot of blood.

20:52.602 --> 20:53.701
Sponges. Suction.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.306
Okay, get that C-arm out of the way.

20:59.308 --> 21:00.808
Tim, get ready on pump.

21:07.548 --> 21:09.816
All right, folks. We're gonna open him up.

21:20.576 --> 21:21.609
Okay, ready on bypass?

21:21.611 --> 21:22.910
Ready when you are.

21:22.912 --> 21:24.845
Lines are up and divided.

21:24.847 --> 21:26.147
Okay, ready for the saw.

21:26.149 --> 21:28.383
- Dr. Sharpe?
- All systems go.

21:28.385 --> 21:30.685
All right.
Let's get this chest open.

21:30.687 --> 21:31.586
Testing.

21:33.790 --> 21:35.122
Dr. Bell,

21:35.124 --> 21:36.924
there's a call from the
board chair... it's urgent.

21:36.926 --> 21:37.925
No, this is urgent.

21:37.927 --> 21:39.426
But, Dr. Bell, they're insisting.

21:39.428 --> 21:40.695
I said not now.

21:40.697 --> 21:43.430
I'm not leaving this O.R.
until he is safely on bypass.

21:43.432 --> 21:45.800
- So what should I tell...
- Hang up the phone.

21:45.802 --> 21:48.769
So, I kind of had an ulterior
motive in keeping you behind.

21:48.771 --> 21:50.137
I thought maybe you did.

21:50.139 --> 21:51.371
I have some questions

21:51.373 --> 21:52.906
I need to ask you
about Georgia in private.

21:52.908 --> 21:55.175
What kind of questions?

21:55.177 --> 21:57.478
Well, she's been having a
lot of accidents recently.

21:57.480 --> 22:00.080
I wanted to make sure there
was no underlying condition.

22:00.082 --> 22:02.282
Does she complain
of headaches? Dizziness?

22:02.284 --> 22:04.718
Okay, um...

22:04.720 --> 22:05.685
the truth.

22:05.687 --> 22:07.020
Always a good place to start.

22:07.022 --> 22:08.622
I'm worried sick about her.

22:08.624 --> 22:10.256
I didn't want to say this
in front of her, you know,

22:10.258 --> 22:11.524
but I'm glad we're talking.

22:11.526 --> 22:12.759
You are?

22:12.761 --> 22:14.761
Remember before how she said
that she'd been drinking,

22:14.763 --> 22:16.763
and that was before noon...
that didn't strike you weird?

22:16.765 --> 22:17.964
Well, it did, actually,

22:17.966 --> 22:19.599
but I just assumed
that you were celebrating.

22:19.601 --> 22:21.835
Yeah, well, she's been
celebrating a lot lately.

22:21.837 --> 22:24.504
S-she lost her waitressing job.
She's out all hours.

22:24.506 --> 22:27.106
She freaks out over nothing,
throws stuff around.

22:27.108 --> 22:28.207
Must be hard for you.

22:28.209 --> 22:30.042
We haven't been together that long.

22:30.044 --> 22:33.246
We fell hard and fast,
but I want to stand by her.

22:33.248 --> 22:34.412
God, the thing that hurts the most

22:34.462 --> 22:37.150
is that she makes up these
crazy stories about me.

22:37.152 --> 22:38.083
What kind of stories?

22:38.085 --> 22:39.385
The point is, I married her,

22:39.387 --> 22:43.188
and I want to stand by her...
sickness and health...

22:45.291 --> 22:46.358
But I'm-I'm wondering

22:46.360 --> 22:48.694
if maybe we should get her a referral.

22:48.696 --> 22:49.995
A referral?

22:49.997 --> 22:52.230
Yeah, for, like, a psychiatrist.

22:52.232 --> 22:55.034
I really think she needs it.

22:55.036 --> 22:56.601
Can I see your hand?

22:56.603 --> 23:00.004
I just need to check your
fingers for capillary refill.

23:00.006 --> 23:03.441
Helps me know
your blood pressure's okay.

23:05.978 --> 23:07.845
Did you draw that there?

23:07.847 --> 23:09.314
Yeah.

23:10.683 --> 23:13.051
You wanted to tell us something?

23:13.053 --> 23:14.318
No. It was stupid.

23:14.320 --> 23:16.688
It's just... I didn't mean it.

23:18.190 --> 23:19.691
It's not like what you think it is.

23:19.693 --> 23:20.892
What do I think it is?

23:23.829 --> 23:27.131
I didn't fall in the park.

23:27.133 --> 23:28.900
Um...

23:28.902 --> 23:30.601
It was still an accident.

23:30.603 --> 23:34.271
Chase is... he's just
crushed by stress right now.

23:34.273 --> 23:36.340
It's really hard

23:36.342 --> 23:39.009
trying to break in
as a rock star.

23:39.011 --> 23:40.244
Um...

23:41.613 --> 23:43.681
And he's really passionate.

23:45.283 --> 23:47.217
And he has nobody. It's just me.

23:47.219 --> 23:48.785
There's no family.

23:49.954 --> 23:52.022
It's hard being somebody's everything.

23:52.024 --> 23:53.590
Yeah, his life when he was a kid...

23:53.592 --> 23:57.427
he-he has nightmares about it.

23:57.429 --> 24:00.130
And he's on edge.

24:00.132 --> 24:04.166
I think...
I think he just lashes out

24:04.168 --> 24:05.668
without realizing it.

24:05.670 --> 24:06.836
It's not his fault.

24:06.838 --> 24:08.137
You don't want to abandon him.

24:08.139 --> 24:09.739
- No.
- Yeah.

24:09.741 --> 24:11.708
He would get a lot worse if I did that.

24:15.379 --> 24:18.814
My sister used to date someone like Chase.

24:18.816 --> 24:20.182
He was...

24:20.184 --> 24:24.754
handsome, funny, but...

24:24.756 --> 24:26.388
Even I thought he was a catch at first.

24:26.390 --> 24:27.656
At first.

24:27.658 --> 24:29.691
Yeah.

24:29.693 --> 24:31.894
I was away at med school,

24:31.896 --> 24:33.129
and I knew
they were having trouble.

24:33.131 --> 24:34.230
Mm-hmm.

24:34.232 --> 24:36.365
So I came back to see her.

24:36.367 --> 24:39.134
Talked her out of it.
She'd never been happier, right?

24:39.136 --> 24:40.469
No.

24:41.604 --> 24:45.006
I couldn't... talk her out of it.

24:46.942 --> 24:48.310
The next time I saw her,

24:48.312 --> 24:52.046
she had a colostomy bag and
her jaw was wired shut.

24:53.649 --> 24:55.884
She's better now.

24:55.886 --> 25:00.488
She's had to move a lot...

25:00.490 --> 25:02.290
but she's getting there.

25:06.628 --> 25:08.362
I want your help.

25:10.131 --> 25:12.833
Just no police, okay? Do you promise?

25:16.137 --> 25:18.005
Yeah.

25:20.875 --> 25:22.476
If I want to file a civil suit

25:22.478 --> 25:24.378
against a former board member, I will.

25:24.380 --> 25:26.379
You don't tell me what to do,

25:26.381 --> 25:29.049
and you sure as hell don't take
me out of surgery to do it!

25:38.127 --> 25:39.359
Get your hands...

25:39.361 --> 25:40.560
Shh. Shh. Shh.

25:52.840 --> 25:54.874
Well, she didn't exactly open up to me.

25:54.876 --> 25:55.975
She defended him.

25:55.977 --> 25:58.410
She loves him, but she wants our help.

25:58.412 --> 26:00.980
He told me she's a crazy drunk liar

26:00.982 --> 26:02.348
in need of psychiatric help.

26:02.350 --> 26:03.415
Of course he did.

26:03.417 --> 26:05.718
You believe him?

26:05.720 --> 26:08.254
No. Not for a second.

26:08.256 --> 26:09.956
How long until imaging comes back?

26:09.958 --> 26:11.390
15 minutes.

26:11.392 --> 26:14.626
Then that's how long we have
to get her away from him.

26:14.628 --> 26:16.795
Keep them here, no matter what.

26:16.797 --> 26:18.430
Okay.

26:24.571 --> 26:26.137
Hey.

26:27.741 --> 26:30.642
Okay, do you remember before,

26:30.644 --> 26:33.144
when I told you that I wanted to die?

26:33.146 --> 26:37.415
I did, for a very, very long time.

26:37.417 --> 26:39.584
Yeah. I don't know
how you got through that.

26:39.586 --> 26:41.019
I didn't.

26:41.021 --> 26:43.188
All that I had left in me

26:43.190 --> 26:45.991
was this-this-this thing,

26:45.993 --> 26:50.261
this singular desire to prove
to the world that I existed.

26:50.263 --> 26:51.729
You did that, Max.

26:51.731 --> 26:54.031
No, I didn't.

26:54.033 --> 26:56.300
I didn't. Yvonne did.

26:56.302 --> 26:59.937
She's the only one who could
see that I was in there.

26:59.939 --> 27:02.607
She... she reached inside,

27:02.609 --> 27:04.741
and she-she pulled me out of that hell,

27:04.743 --> 27:06.210
and she set me free.

27:07.345 --> 27:11.148
Yeah, I think I understand
why you can't let her go.

27:11.150 --> 27:14.318
And those are the years
I went completely insane,

27:14.320 --> 27:15.386
and she was there.

27:15.388 --> 27:17.554
She was the one who...

27:17.556 --> 27:21.057
She was the one who pulled me back.

27:21.059 --> 27:24.227
I don't think I can go
on without her, but...

27:25.663 --> 27:29.065
I mean, the thought of
taking away her happiness

27:29.067 --> 27:31.234
and holding her back...

27:32.570 --> 27:34.538
that's worse than the thought of losing her.

27:35.907 --> 27:39.042
So you don't want me to try and stop her.

27:39.044 --> 27:40.410
I did before.

27:42.046 --> 27:43.712
Not anymore.

27:45.249 --> 27:49.018
Now what I want from you...

27:49.020 --> 27:51.220
is to help me let her go.

28:10.351 --> 28:11.951
Okay.

28:13.987 --> 28:17.590
Dr. Bishop, give me some good news.

28:22.864 --> 28:25.331
Sorry. Impedance is too high.

28:25.333 --> 28:28.200
All right, we try again. 11 blade.

28:31.606 --> 28:32.671
Is that the house?

28:32.673 --> 28:35.807
Oh, yes. Most definitely.

28:35.809 --> 28:36.908
Then take it if you need to.

28:36.910 --> 28:38.410
I can page a resident at this point.

28:38.412 --> 28:41.247
I am not leaving this O.R.
till we get this guy's heart back.

28:44.016 --> 28:45.784
Everything okay?

28:47.386 --> 28:49.755
Just having second thoughts.

28:49.757 --> 28:54.059
My sister wants me to... meet somebody,

28:54.061 --> 28:56.995
and she says that I'm not doing it here.

28:56.997 --> 28:59.731
She has big plans for me out west.

29:01.734 --> 29:03.968
But I'm not sure I want to go.

29:06.104 --> 29:07.938
Mind if I ask you what's holding you back?

29:07.940 --> 29:09.741
Mm.

29:09.743 --> 29:14.479
I worry that he'll feel abandoned.

29:15.981 --> 29:18.115
Have you talked about this with Max?

29:19.618 --> 29:22.486
I'm-I'm building up to it.

29:22.488 --> 29:25.656
Max and I actually had a conversation.

29:25.658 --> 29:27.524
Um.

29:27.526 --> 29:31.762
See, I was in a...
a similar place not so long ago,

29:31.764 --> 29:34.498
and, um you know, alive,

29:34.500 --> 29:36.767
but not able
to interact with the world,

29:36.769 --> 29:38.535
and, uh, I just wanted to check in with him

29:38.537 --> 29:40.437
and see how he was doing.

29:40.439 --> 29:44.107
And what did you learn?

29:44.109 --> 29:46.242
Why don't I show you?

29:48.212 --> 29:49.813
All right.

29:56.253 --> 29:57.687
Hey, Max.

29:57.689 --> 29:59.055
Are you happy right now?

30:01.625 --> 30:04.760
And are you happy because Yvonne is here?

30:09.433 --> 30:12.335
You know that
she has a job, though...

30:12.337 --> 30:13.436
and she has to go away.

30:16.906 --> 30:21.109
Yvonne...
Max wants me to tell you

30:21.111 --> 30:25.180
that, uh, he knows you have a
life of your own to live...

30:27.217 --> 30:29.784
and he wouldn't dream of
standing in the way of that.

30:29.786 --> 30:34.189
And for everything that you've done for him,

30:34.191 --> 30:37.726
he wishes you
all the happiness in the world.

30:40.830 --> 30:43.998
That about, uh, sum it up?

30:45.968 --> 30:49.270
And, um, you learned all of this how?

30:49.272 --> 30:52.507
Uh, it was a-a process.

30:52.509 --> 30:55.209
And, um, you could say I...

30:55.211 --> 30:56.944
I filled in the blinks a little bit.

31:02.150 --> 31:05.086
Ohh, Max.

31:07.422 --> 31:09.957
I'm gonna miss you so much.

31:11.527 --> 31:13.660
I hope you know that.

31:19.166 --> 31:22.436
Are you sure
that you're okay with this?

31:29.810 --> 31:32.345
Goodbye, Max.

31:44.691 --> 31:45.758
Hi.

31:45.760 --> 31:47.993
The MRI... it's bad news, isn't it?

31:47.995 --> 31:50.162
You don't have an aneurysm, Jackson.

31:50.164 --> 31:52.665
That's great. So what do I have?

31:52.667 --> 31:54.867
You experienced coital cephalgia,

31:54.869 --> 31:57.303
also known
as "orgasmic thunderclap."

31:57.305 --> 31:59.705
That's not even a real thing.
sounds like a racehorse.

31:59.707 --> 32:01.006
It is a real thing.

32:01.008 --> 32:04.043
It's also probably not a sign
of any underlying condition.

32:04.045 --> 32:05.444
This is the worst.

32:05.446 --> 32:07.379
I mean, my whole life... it's over.

32:07.381 --> 32:08.814
It's good news.

32:08.816 --> 32:09.982
What?

32:09.984 --> 32:11.817
Don't tell me this is good news.

32:11.819 --> 32:13.285
You mean, every time I
go to bed with someone,

32:13.287 --> 32:15.254
I risk having
the worst agony of my life?

32:15.256 --> 32:16.655
Not necessarily.

32:16.657 --> 32:18.123
That is not a "no."

32:18.125 --> 32:20.792
It could be a one-time thing.

32:20.794 --> 32:23.929
I mean, it's never happened before, right?

32:23.931 --> 32:27.098
Even when you were, you know, alone.

32:28.569 --> 32:30.435
Yeah.

32:30.437 --> 32:32.270
No, we're not doing this.

32:32.272 --> 32:33.839
Got to go to work.

32:42.647 --> 32:44.148
Okay, if this doesn't work...

32:44.150 --> 32:45.916
It'll work.

32:52.858 --> 32:55.292
Looks good. Impedance is low.

32:55.294 --> 32:56.594
Nice capture, Dr. Bell.

32:56.596 --> 32:59.396
Okay, great job, everybody.

32:59.398 --> 33:01.298
Jeremy, if you want to check your messages,

33:01.300 --> 33:02.566
I can handle it from here.

33:02.568 --> 33:05.369
Yeah, I should probably check in.

33:05.371 --> 33:06.937
Hey, uh...

33:06.939 --> 33:09.039
That Zach Miller,
he's a pretty good guy, huh?

33:09.041 --> 33:12.242
Yeah, he is. Why?

33:12.244 --> 33:13.910
Just saying.

33:14.945 --> 33:18.615
All right, let's
get Mr. Wesley off bypass.

33:18.617 --> 33:19.983
We don't have your results back yet.

33:19.985 --> 33:21.218
I really think you should stay.

33:21.220 --> 33:22.386
We've been here long enough.

33:22.388 --> 33:23.987
They were talking about your drinking.

33:23.989 --> 33:25.522
They want to take you
to some nightmare rehab.

33:25.524 --> 33:26.856
That is not true, Georgia.

33:26.858 --> 33:28.525
Please, if we could just
have another moment alone.

33:28.527 --> 33:29.759
I think we need to go.

33:29.761 --> 33:31.127
No, Chase.

33:31.129 --> 33:33.696
We have some results that we
need to give Georgia in private.

33:33.698 --> 33:34.764
You need to leave her with us.

33:34.766 --> 33:35.899
Get out of my way!

33:35.901 --> 33:38.267
Dr. Williams, call security.

33:38.269 --> 33:41.004
You guys are just making this worse!

33:41.578 --> 33:44.407
Hey, hey.
Let's just all chill, okay?

33:44.409 --> 33:46.542
I just don't like it when
people tell me what to do.

33:46.544 --> 33:48.144
Not a problem.

33:48.146 --> 33:50.812
We just need you to step
out into the waiting area.

33:50.814 --> 33:53.482
She will join you there, all right?

33:55.185 --> 33:57.019
It'll just be for a minute.

33:58.655 --> 34:00.255
Georgia.

34:03.292 --> 34:05.493
Girl talk, huh? That's cool.

34:07.630 --> 34:09.364
I'll wait for you down there.

34:10.498 --> 34:12.067
I love you.

34:18.873 --> 34:20.808
What have I done?

34:20.810 --> 34:22.310
Georgia, I've spoken with a shelter.

34:22.312 --> 34:23.744
They're sending someone to pick you up.

34:23.746 --> 34:24.946
You don't have to be there long,

34:24.947 --> 34:27.114
just long enough
to get your feet under you.

34:27.117 --> 34:28.683
This is happening really fast.

34:28.685 --> 34:30.918
You said you had a sister, right?

34:30.920 --> 34:32.386
Maybe she could pick up some stuff for you?

34:32.388 --> 34:34.221
I have a cat.

34:34.223 --> 34:36.690
I'll take your cat.

34:36.693 --> 34:39.126
Georgia...

34:39.128 --> 34:41.896
you asked for our help.

34:41.898 --> 34:43.697
Please, let us help you.

34:55.199 --> 34:56.954
I need to speak to Max.

35:09.079 --> 35:12.048
I didn't even make it out of the building.

35:13.784 --> 35:16.119
You know, it's strange, but, um...

35:16.472 --> 35:20.208
You and I have a bond that I
don't have with anyone else.

35:21.859 --> 35:22.859
You know, I don't...

35:22.861 --> 35:27.330
uh, I don't... like people much.

35:29.005 --> 35:33.402
But the person
that I know is in there...

35:33.404 --> 35:36.905
him... I like.

35:39.643 --> 35:41.143
So...

35:43.847 --> 35:45.747
I appreciate you letting me go...

35:47.884 --> 35:49.417
But I don't want to.

35:52.288 --> 35:54.389
Get better.

35:54.391 --> 35:56.859
Come back to Silver Oaks.

35:56.861 --> 35:58.193
Okay?

36:06.535 --> 36:08.603
Simon, how are you feeling?

36:08.605 --> 36:11.740
A little bit like my chest was cracked open.

36:11.742 --> 36:13.007
Dr. Bishop tells me

36:13.009 --> 36:15.109
I'm getting a second chance again

36:15.111 --> 36:16.911
because of you.

36:16.913 --> 36:17.912
I'm Dr. Bell.

36:17.914 --> 36:19.213
Diego.

36:19.215 --> 36:21.983
Thank you, Dr. Bell.

36:22.174 --> 36:25.319
You know, Simon never even
told me he had a pacemaker.

36:25.321 --> 36:28.289
Well, a knife fight's a way
sexier explanation for a scar.

36:29.492 --> 36:31.325
So he's gonna be okay?

36:31.327 --> 36:32.559
Well, I don't think

36:32.561 --> 36:34.261
he's gonna be doing a triathlon this year,

36:34.263 --> 36:35.896
but next year is a definite possibility,

36:35.898 --> 36:38.665
and this is not gonna hold him
back from living his life.

36:39.935 --> 36:42.503
It's weird to think of
someone watching my heart

36:42.505 --> 36:43.637
from miles away.

36:43.639 --> 36:45.639
Yeah, but you do need to
come in for a follow-up

36:45.641 --> 36:47.340
to make sure that everything is working,

36:47.342 --> 36:49.643
'cause it's a pacemaker... right?
Not a waffle iron.

36:50.678 --> 36:52.279
Ah! Ohh.

36:53.448 --> 36:57.483
So, is mine the last
life you're saving today?

36:57.485 --> 36:59.119
Well, you're my last surgery,

36:59.121 --> 37:01.487
but I need to go pick some
paint colors for my office

37:01.489 --> 37:04.757
before they start charging
me rent at the coffee kiosk.

37:04.759 --> 37:08.227
I, uh, talked to Dr. Miller about that.

37:08.229 --> 37:10.430
I'm a decorator.

37:10.432 --> 37:11.731
Um...

37:11.733 --> 37:13.499
You might want to see him.
He's got a surprise for you.

37:13.501 --> 37:15.835
Really? That's interesting.

37:17.070 --> 37:18.738
Get some rest, Simon.

37:18.740 --> 37:23.275
He seems like a good guy... Dr. Miller.

37:23.277 --> 37:25.311
So I hear.

37:27.080 --> 37:28.880
You know where the parking garage is?

37:28.882 --> 37:31.050
- I've been here before.
- It's your sister.

37:31.052 --> 37:32.684
She's got your things,
and your cat's taken care of.

37:32.686 --> 37:34.286
But what's gonna happen to Chase?

37:34.288 --> 37:35.487
What are you gonna tell him?

37:35.489 --> 37:36.855
Whatever you want.

37:36.857 --> 37:38.157
I'm sorry.

37:38.159 --> 37:41.059
Uh, tell him I'll call him
as soon as I can and...

37:41.061 --> 37:43.595
- We should get going.
- Look, I-I made a promise to him.

37:43.597 --> 37:46.197
And he made one to you, which he broke.

37:47.266 --> 37:48.533
It's time to go.

37:48.535 --> 37:51.202
Come on.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.477
What do you think?

38:00.947 --> 38:03.081
We've done what we can.

38:03.083 --> 38:04.682
Let's get back to work.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.403
They agreed to the closing date?

38:26.405 --> 38:27.437
That's great.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.672
No, no, no.

38:29.674 --> 38:33.710
No, I think you did really well for us.

38:33.712 --> 38:35.145
Yeah.

38:36.981 --> 38:38.115
Yeah, me, too.

38:38.117 --> 38:39.216
All right.

38:39.218 --> 38:40.550
Bye.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.690
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

38:47.692 --> 38:49.859
That was just...

38:49.861 --> 38:52.328
my marriage ending.

38:54.899 --> 38:56.232
Sounds like whatever went wrong,

38:56.234 --> 38:57.634
you guys still respect each other.

38:57.636 --> 39:00.403
We do.

39:02.605 --> 39:04.606
You want to get a drink?

39:04.608 --> 39:06.775
Talk about it?

39:06.777 --> 39:08.177
Only if I'm buying.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.012
Mm.

39:10.014 --> 39:12.114
I have a $200,000 student loan,

39:12.116 --> 39:14.816
so... yeah.

39:14.818 --> 39:16.785
You can buy.

39:18.755 --> 39:20.522
Everything you ever wanted to know

39:20.524 --> 39:23.759
about coital cephalgia
but were afraid to ask.

39:23.761 --> 39:26.494
Spoiler alert... there are
many ways to avoid or manage it

39:26.496 --> 39:28.797
if it becomes chronic,
which it probably won't.

39:28.799 --> 39:30.599
So it could all just go away?

39:30.601 --> 39:32.834
And if it doesn't, you just
need to let your partner know

39:32.836 --> 39:34.135
that you need to go slow.

39:34.137 --> 39:36.971
Yeah, well, don't have one of those anymore.

39:36.973 --> 39:39.640
Are you sure about that?

39:39.642 --> 39:40.942
Yep.

39:42.711 --> 39:45.313
Oh Maria.

39:45.315 --> 39:46.314
You called her.

39:46.316 --> 39:47.882
She came looking for you.

39:47.884 --> 39:49.517
She's really sweet.

39:49.519 --> 39:50.751
She was worried sick.

39:50.753 --> 39:52.553
She said that you kicked
her out of your apartment.

39:52.555 --> 39:53.854
Okay, I was embarrassed.

39:53.856 --> 39:55.089
Well, she really likes you,

39:55.091 --> 39:58.225
so go talk to her
and tell her what happened.

40:01.897 --> 40:04.264
Dr. Lin, thanks.

40:04.266 --> 40:05.866
I owe you one.

40:05.868 --> 40:07.768
All your stuff is safe with me,
even the one about...

40:07.770 --> 40:09.103
Okay, just go.

40:10.605 --> 40:11.871
Hey.

40:18.446 --> 40:19.679
Dr. Miller.

40:19.681 --> 40:20.947
Hey.

40:20.949 --> 40:22.916
I have been mulling over your color problems

40:22.918 --> 40:24.651
and decided to consult a professional.

40:24.653 --> 40:26.052
So I heard.

40:26.054 --> 40:28.354
Step this way.

40:28.356 --> 40:30.090
I've narrowed it down to three choices.

40:30.092 --> 40:31.791
Please tell me about them.

40:31.793 --> 40:32.726
Okay.

40:32.728 --> 40:36.029
This is ruminating thistle.

40:36.031 --> 40:37.697
It's a soothing little number...

40:37.699 --> 40:40.466
good for your imagination and creativity...

40:40.468 --> 40:43.469
underrated qualities in a chief of surgery.

40:43.471 --> 40:44.303
I like it.

40:44.305 --> 40:45.804
But not so fast,

40:45.806 --> 40:48.407
because this is serengeti sentience.

40:48.409 --> 40:53.279
Resolve, efficiency, quiet strength...

40:53.281 --> 40:55.981
a very Dawn Bell color, if I may say.

40:55.983 --> 40:57.283
You may.

40:57.285 --> 40:59.118
This...

41:00.820 --> 41:04.422
This is the best one out of them all.

41:04.424 --> 41:07.259
Let me tell you a little bit
about philosopher's creek.

41:34.287 --> 41:36.453
Everybody keeps telling me
what a great guy you are.

41:38.156 --> 41:40.691
I might've lost my way for a
little while there, but...

41:43.094 --> 41:44.728
I'm trying to find my way back.

41:49.633 --> 41:51.234
I don't know where this is gonna go.

41:53.970 --> 41:56.406
We've known each other for seven years.

41:57.708 --> 41:58.941
I'm in no hurry.
