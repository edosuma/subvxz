00:05.673 --> 00:07.506
MS flair-up. Take the pressure
off the leg with this.

00:07.657 --> 00:09.324
No, it's a concession to the
disease, and I won't make it.

00:09.418 --> 00:11.401
Look, man, I'm preparing
for my mother's passing,

00:11.420 --> 00:13.737
and when she does,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

00:13.756 --> 00:15.330
163 anti-psychotic prescriptions

-Believe it.

00:39.448 --> 00:42.524
26-year-old male found down
at Piedmont Park,

00:42.543 --> 00:44.376
overdosed on olanzapine.

00:44.528 --> 00:46.027
We were able
to bring him back,

00:46.196 --> 00:47.454
but found this on him.

00:47.606 --> 00:50.123
It has your name on it,
but records show

00:50.217 --> 00:52.442
-you never treated him.
-Because I didn't,

00:52.536 --> 00:55.128
just like the overdose
from a few weeks ago.

00:56.298 --> 00:59.499
This prescription is from the
same pharmacy as the last one.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.210
Think it's a coincidence?

01:02.229 --> 01:04.354
No.

WOMAN:
We're just closing.

01:17.727 --> 01:19.986
I'm a doctor at Chastain.
A patient came into our ER,

01:20.081 --> 01:22.897
overdosed from a drug
he got at this pharmacy.

01:22.991 --> 01:26.234
It lists me as the prescriber,
but I didn't write it.

01:26.328 --> 01:27.994
I'm so sorry to hear that,

01:28.089 --> 01:31.406

how I can help you, Doctor...?

Hawkins.
This isn't the first time.

01:35.412 --> 01:37.721
Do you know
who's prescribing these?

01:41.936 --> 01:44.419
I honestly thought
they were yours.

01:44.513 --> 01:47.356
I didn't realize
patients were overdosing.

01:48.667 --> 01:51.568
I just fill the prescriptions

01:56.266 --> 01:57.432

01:58.677 --> 02:01.027
If more fraudulent prescriptions

Wait here.

Who was that?

02:33.395 --> 02:35.896
What are you still doing here?

02:35.972 --> 02:37.823
Was he asking questions?

02:38.050 --> 02:40.233
No. He was nobody.

02:40.402 --> 02:42.494
Just a patient wanting a refill.

02:56.493 --> 02:57.634
(dings)

03:00.906 --> 03:05.601
His credit card didn't run,

Two cars were street racing.

One lost control,
crashed into this mini-mart.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.138
Two are critical.
One is the driver.

-The other is the store owner.
-All right, let's split up.

03:54.235 --> 03:56.460
I'll take this one.

03:57.296 --> 03:59.238
We've tried everything
to move him, but a metal piece

03:59.465 --> 04:00.906
from the door has pierced
his abdomen.

04:01.057 --> 04:02.557
(crying):
It hurts.

04:02.651 --> 04:04.150
CONRAD:
Penetrating abdominal injury.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.662
Moving him could
cause more damage.

04:07.897 --> 04:09.414
And he's got an open
femur fracture.

04:09.566 --> 04:11.308
-EMTs applied a tourniquet.
-He's still bleeding out.

04:11.326 --> 04:13.401
Let's give him some blood,
but we can't wait any longer.

04:13.495 --> 04:14.828
We got to free him.

She's still in refractory V-fib.

04:19.318 --> 04:21.051
I'm gonna get an ultrasound.

You have to save my mother.

04:26.082 --> 04:28.082
The car came through the window,

04:28.102 --> 04:29.518

out of the way.

04:30.996 --> 04:34.439

Got it.

04:44.267 --> 04:45.433
We're gonna cut
this piece of metal

that's lodged
in your abdomen, okay?

04:48.530 --> 04:49.955

She won't make it
to the hospital.

You don't know that.

We just need
to support her heart.

give her amio

05:20.045 --> 05:21.545
-and get her to the ER.
-ECMO will work.

05:21.563 --> 05:22.896

05:23.048 --> 05:24.381
Yeah, rarely. In this situation,

-Maybe.
-Maybe?

CADE:
Let's move her.

10:55.230 --> 10:57.230
Grab her C-spine.

10:57.382 --> 10:59.532
Hawkins, what's your problem?

11:01.887 --> 11:05.080
This is the pharmacist who
filled the fake prescriptions.

11:06.241 --> 11:09.334
CADE:
On my count. One, two, three.

11:10.820 --> 11:12.745
What are you talking about?

11:12.898 --> 11:14.339
I went to see her
a few hours ago.

11:14.490 --> 11:16.082
That's where I was
when you called me for Go Team.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.067
And you confronted her?

11:18.161 --> 11:19.752
Why the hell would you do that?

11:19.905 --> 11:22.347
There was another overdose.
More pills with my name on them.

11:22.574 --> 11:25.100
You realize this could be
blowback from your visit?

11:27.429 --> 11:28.687
Yes. I'm aware.

11:31.099 --> 11:33.507
Phoebe, can you hear me?

11:33.601 --> 11:37.103
She's not waking up,
but her airway is secure.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.863
No rebound tenderness.

11:40.016 --> 11:43.118
How did she seem
when you saw her earlier?

11:44.353 --> 11:46.095
Calm, ready to help.

11:47.098 --> 11:48.998
Someone could have pushed her
down the stairs.

11:49.543 --> 11:50.709
I hear you.

11:50.894 --> 11:52.785
Or the EMT said she was drunk.
Maybe she fell.

11:52.938 --> 11:57.090
Everything's on the table.
Including an accident.

11:59.461 --> 12:01.052
Normal S1 and S2.

12:01.279 --> 12:04.681
FAST is negative.
Let's get a tox panel.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.226
CONRAD:
Blown pupil.

12:08.453 --> 12:09.953
She could have
an intracranial hemorrhage.

12:10.046 --> 12:11.137
Page Billie and Leela.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.564
Let's get her to CT now.

12:14.476 --> 12:16.383
(beeping rapidly)

12:16.478 --> 12:18.385
JAYCI:
Intracranial pressures
rising fast.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.146
LEELA:
Must've been a really bad fall.

12:20.298 --> 12:21.698
BILLIE:
We have to drill now.

12:24.986 --> 12:27.162
(whirring)

12:37.816 --> 12:40.425
How's our pharmacist doing?

12:42.578 --> 12:45.722
Brain bleed is worse
than we thought.

12:47.583 --> 12:51.585
I hear your prehospital ECMO
on the mom got complicated.

12:51.679 --> 12:54.606
Dr. Austin is handling it.

12:54.833 --> 12:57.834
The pharmacist's labs came back.
Blood alcohol was negative.

12:58.594 --> 13:00.520
She wasn't drunk
when I saw her, so...

13:00.688 --> 13:04.190
still could be a suicide attempt
or maybe she slipped.

13:04.342 --> 13:06.284
Or again, she was pushed.

13:06.435 --> 13:08.953
Could someone have seen you
at the pharmacy?

13:09.030 --> 13:10.771
No. We were alone.

13:10.865 --> 13:13.440
She left me to find
some records,

13:13.535 --> 13:15.442
was taking forever,
I got your call, left.

13:15.537 --> 13:17.203
Why did you go
without telling me?

13:17.297 --> 13:19.446
-I need your permission?
-You need my help.

13:19.541 --> 13:22.116
Prescription drug scams
are favored by the mob.

13:22.210 --> 13:24.694
They kill people who threaten
their revenue stream.

13:24.712 --> 13:26.620
That's why we handed this
over to the FBI.

13:26.714 --> 13:30.725
I can't have my name on bottles
of drugs that kill people.

13:32.387 --> 13:33.870
That pharmacist knew something.

13:33.888 --> 13:35.647
Maybe everything. And if
someone saw you with her...

13:35.874 --> 13:38.066
All right, you made your point.

13:43.064 --> 13:47.158
If it turns out that I caused
this, will I feel guilty? Yes.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.995
Can I undo it? No.

13:51.072 --> 13:53.406
So now we have to save her.

13:53.558 --> 13:56.668
And contact the FBI
in the morning.

13:58.396 --> 14:00.088
-(sighs)
-(door opens)

14:01.842 --> 14:03.716
(door closes)

14:05.587 --> 14:07.587
Hi, Carol.

14:07.681 --> 14:08.847
Sorry to keep you waiting.

14:08.998 --> 14:12.258
CAROL:
Thank you for making the time.

14:12.410 --> 14:14.335
I feel like I've been
such a bother

14:14.354 --> 14:16.354
to everyone for so long.
(stammers)

14:16.581 --> 14:19.858
-Mom...
-No. No, you have been
no trouble at all.

14:20.085 --> 14:22.360
So, AJ tells me that you're
having some issues with pain.

14:22.511 --> 14:23.344
What's going on?

14:23.363 --> 14:28.091
My bad days are getting worse.

14:28.109 --> 14:30.760
My good days are, too.

14:30.778 --> 14:32.261
AUSTIN:
She's having pain

14:32.355 --> 14:35.022
across her chest, and it-it's
wrapping around her back.

14:35.116 --> 14:37.617
Sometimes, when I move,

14:37.769 --> 14:42.088
the pain is so sharp
I feel like I can't breathe.

14:43.108 --> 14:44.531
It started a couple of days ago.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.385
Before that,
I was doing so well.

14:47.536 --> 14:49.445
Yeah. Yeah, she was.

14:49.538 --> 14:53.207
Last week, she made the most
exquisite seafood paella.

14:53.301 --> 14:56.119
(laughs softly)
And I beat him in chess.

14:56.137 --> 14:57.970
-Indeed you did.
-Or you let me win.

14:58.064 --> 15:01.048
No, not at all, Mom.
That was a legit thrashing.

15:01.142 --> 15:02.475
I played the King's Indian,

15:02.569 --> 15:05.795
and she overwhelmed
my bishop pawn.

15:05.813 --> 15:07.363
Well done.

15:08.299 --> 15:10.650
So, are the pain meds helping?

15:10.802 --> 15:12.301
Some.

15:12.470 --> 15:15.371
But they make me sleepy
and confused.

15:16.732 --> 15:18.307
Pravesh.

15:18.401 --> 15:21.002
We have to find out
what the cause of this is.

15:24.332 --> 15:27.008
Maybe there's something
we can do.

15:38.587 --> 15:40.688
♪ ♪

15:47.930 --> 15:51.407
I-I knew the cancer
was advancing, but...

15:53.436 --> 15:55.269
Wow.

15:55.363 --> 15:57.705
DEVON:
I'm so sorry, AJ.

15:59.775 --> 16:02.460
No wonder she's in so much pain.

16:04.130 --> 16:08.207
The cancer has progressed
to her chest walls...

16:08.359 --> 16:10.301
(exhales)
and her brain.

16:11.863 --> 16:15.431
An intercostal nerve block
could help her with the pain.

16:17.035 --> 16:20.144
All right,
let's get it done tonight.

16:20.296 --> 16:22.304
And I'll take her home.

16:23.132 --> 16:24.315
You understand the prognosis...

16:24.467 --> 16:27.043
Yes, I understand
the prognosis, Pravesh!

16:27.061 --> 16:28.695
I'm a doctor!

16:33.159 --> 16:35.660
Do you want me
to talk to her with you?

16:37.388 --> 16:38.746
No.

16:42.060 --> 16:44.085
This is on me.

16:52.253 --> 16:54.387
Look, I'm sorry, man.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.188
(door opens)

17:14.868 --> 17:16.759
So, it's something
called a nerve block.

17:16.778 --> 17:18.928
It's a minimally
invasive procedure

17:19.021 --> 17:21.264
that treats the source
of the pain.

17:21.282 --> 17:23.599
So you should
feel relief right away.

17:23.601 --> 17:29.464
If I can just go back
to where I was before this.

17:30.366 --> 17:32.050
(exhales)

17:35.446 --> 17:36.512
What?

17:39.450 --> 17:40.966
Um...

17:41.119 --> 17:45.212
Well, the scans show
that the cancer is progressing.

17:45.231 --> 17:49.792
And it's-it's now in your brain

17:49.885 --> 17:53.071
and in the bones on your chest,

17:53.222 --> 17:55.464
which is why it-it hurts
so much to breathe.

17:55.558 --> 18:00.303
But the, um,
the-the met in your brain

18:00.321 --> 18:03.539
is what's of most concern.

18:09.071 --> 18:12.006
(exhales):
How long?

18:16.988 --> 18:18.638
Son.

18:20.266 --> 18:23.342
-Son, tell me.
-Uh...

18:23.494 --> 18:27.021
(sniffles)
Maybe a couple of months.

18:28.499 --> 18:30.024
(crying softly)

18:40.769 --> 18:42.495
Okay.

18:46.701 --> 18:48.501
(whispers):
Next steps.

18:50.613 --> 18:53.548
We knew this was coming.

18:55.301 --> 18:58.619
Okay, um...

18:58.713 --> 19:02.365
Well, I-I'm going to have
to ask some questions

19:02.383 --> 19:04.533
just to make sure
you get everything you need.

19:04.627 --> 19:11.065
Um, what would you say are
your most important goals now?

19:12.560 --> 19:14.986
Leaving here.

19:16.639 --> 19:19.640
Staying home.

19:19.734 --> 19:21.159
With you.

19:22.053 --> 19:23.828
Okay.

19:24.055 --> 19:28.741
And what are your biggest fears?

19:29.502 --> 19:33.462
I don't want to spend
any more time in a hospital.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.082
(exhales)
Okay.

19:37.235 --> 19:41.179
So that means we're gonna
have to talk about hospice.

19:41.330 --> 19:42.405
Don't.

19:42.407 --> 19:44.423
Not yet.

19:44.575 --> 19:46.242
The word scares me.

19:46.260 --> 19:49.020
That's for the...

19:49.171 --> 19:51.355
That's just for the very end.

19:51.524 --> 19:54.358
No, no, Mom, it's-it's not.
It's not.

19:54.510 --> 19:56.360
No, you can have
hospice for months.

19:56.587 --> 20:01.090
It's a great service that most
people wait too long to use.

20:01.926 --> 20:03.442
You know, hospice nurses
are better

20:03.594 --> 20:06.454
at managing pain
than most doctors.

20:08.266 --> 20:10.023
Okay, we'll-we'll
get you equipment

20:10.117 --> 20:11.858
to make you more comfortable,

20:11.953 --> 20:17.131
and there will be a visiting
nurse to check on you.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.943
And I promise you,
you will never

20:20.962 --> 20:24.430
have to set foot
in this hospital again.

20:30.137 --> 20:32.621
CADE:
Pupils are equal,
round and reactive.

20:32.640 --> 20:33.973
CONRAD:
Heart sounds normal.

20:34.125 --> 20:37.985
Brain bleed was evacuated
without complication.

20:39.464 --> 20:42.055
She should wake up any time now.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.742
We'll ask her what happened.

20:44.893 --> 20:46.244
Any luck with her family?

20:46.395 --> 20:48.371
We haven't been able
to reach them.

20:49.064 --> 20:50.414
(grunts softly)

20:52.735 --> 20:54.043
Hey.

20:55.496 --> 20:57.546
Hello, there.

20:59.166 --> 21:02.677
CONRAD:
Phoebe, how do you feel?

21:04.079 --> 21:05.488
Where am I?

21:05.506 --> 21:08.081
You're at the hospital.
At Chastain.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.675
You had a fall.

21:09.827 --> 21:12.353
Do you remember what happened?

21:12.939 --> 21:15.088
You.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.924
Yes, I remember.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.335
I have to...

21:19.353 --> 21:21.028
(panting)

21:25.192 --> 21:26.433
(monitor beeping rapidly)

21:26.452 --> 21:27.743
Phoebe?

21:28.696 --> 21:29.936
She's in respiratory distress.

21:30.031 --> 21:31.347
Her chest imaging was clear.

21:31.365 --> 21:33.291
This looks like
Kussmaul respirations.

21:33.442 --> 21:36.460
We need to get a blood gas
and get her on oxygen.

21:37.872 --> 21:39.355
No. Where am I?

21:39.373 --> 21:41.674
She's altered. Let's intubate.

21:43.285 --> 21:44.593
We need a crash cart!

21:48.141 --> 21:49.882
-She hasn't regained
consciousness since?
-CADE: No.

21:50.034 --> 21:51.124
Not since she went
into distress.

21:51.218 --> 21:52.476
She was altered and confused.

21:52.703 --> 21:54.720
Her blood gas shows
a severe metabolic acidosis

21:54.872 --> 21:56.038
that she couldn't
compensate for.

21:56.131 --> 21:59.317
Well, her images just came in.

21:59.468 --> 22:02.211
X-ray shows bilateral
infiltrates. That's new.

22:02.380 --> 22:03.487
CONRAD:
That could be ARDS.

22:03.714 --> 22:06.324
Or pulmonary edema
from heart failure.

22:06.475 --> 22:08.308
This is more than just
trauma from the fall.

22:08.328 --> 22:09.885
Something else is going on.

22:09.978 --> 22:11.403
BILLIE:
Well, her head CT looks good.

22:11.556 --> 22:13.164
She hasn't rebled.

22:13.315 --> 22:14.981
I mean, this isn't
centrally driven.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.149
Nor a post-op complication.

22:16.169 --> 22:17.335
All right,
we'll send out more labs,

22:17.486 --> 22:19.244
check lactate and ketones,
get an echo.

22:19.397 --> 22:22.173
Let's figure out why she's
getting worse and save her.

22:24.085 --> 22:25.401
(exhales)

22:25.570 --> 22:27.570
They said he was doing twice
the speed limit.

22:27.588 --> 22:29.180
Drag racing in the middle
of a busy city.

22:29.331 --> 22:30.681
What the hell was he thinking?

22:30.833 --> 22:32.925
What would his parents
expect him to do with a Porsche?

22:33.001 --> 22:35.928
Oh, the usual.
Pick up milk at the market,

22:36.080 --> 22:37.688
help out with carpool.

22:38.916 --> 22:40.382
BOTH:
Oh.

22:41.268 --> 22:43.677
Open fracture
of the right femur,

22:43.754 --> 22:47.423
and bilateral comminuted
tib/fib fractures.

22:47.516 --> 22:50.109
I'll have to rod the femur,
ex-fix the rest.

22:50.261 --> 22:53.278
So, grade IV splenic lac
as expected.

22:53.431 --> 22:54.538
I will do a splenectomy
and penetrating

22:54.690 --> 22:55.948
foreign body removal.

22:56.100 --> 22:57.691
All right, let's go.

22:57.710 --> 23:02.421
You know, we can call another
surgeon to operate with me.

23:03.441 --> 23:04.382
Meaning?

23:04.550 --> 23:06.942
You've had a massive
surgery earlier today,

23:06.961 --> 23:08.293
and now another
in the middle of the night.

23:08.388 --> 23:10.446
It would be a long day
for anyone.

23:10.539 --> 23:12.556
The steroids are working,
the MS is under control.

23:12.708 --> 23:14.558
-I haven't even needed the cane.
-Randolph,

23:14.710 --> 23:19.563
I love you, but you can be
a stubborn old... so-and-so.

23:19.756 --> 23:23.884
I am allowed to worry,
and notice when you're exhausted

23:23.978 --> 23:26.462
and holding yourself upright
on a desk.

23:26.480 --> 23:27.813
Yeah-- Okay.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.240
Yeah, am I sore? Yeah.

23:29.391 --> 23:34.537
But... if I need relief,
I'll tell you.

23:38.993 --> 23:40.492
(door opens)

23:40.645 --> 23:44.146
All right. Eileen's labs are all
trending in the right direction.

23:44.148 --> 23:45.089
She didn't have any other
injuries.

23:45.316 --> 23:46.573
Just the cardiac contusion.

23:46.592 --> 23:48.575
She still needs ECMO support,
we don't know

23:48.594 --> 23:52.154
when she's gonna wake up,
but overall, I'm hopeful.

23:52.247 --> 23:54.339
Can we tell her family?
They could use some good news.

23:54.492 --> 23:55.933
-Let's get her up
to the ICU first.
-HUNDLEY: Okay,

23:56.160 --> 23:59.419
let's prep for transfer, people.
This is no small feat.

23:59.439 --> 24:02.440
Get her on the portable monitor.
Disconnect the vent.

24:02.667 --> 24:03.941
Start bagging.

24:04.168 --> 24:06.527
Put the ECMO machine on the bed.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.114
Watch the cannulas, hon.

24:13.527 --> 24:16.436
(beeping rapidly)

24:16.530 --> 24:19.272
Put pressure now!
Stop the bleeding.

24:19.292 --> 24:21.500
Starting compressions.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.036
You tore her artery.

24:24.188 --> 24:25.037
I didn't mean to.

24:25.189 --> 24:27.298
Hundley, page Austin.

24:27.449 --> 24:28.966
We have to recannulate here,
then get her to surgery

24:29.193 --> 24:31.051
so we can repair the artery.

24:38.794 --> 24:40.561
(elevator dings)

24:42.815 --> 24:44.873
-What the hell
were you thinking?
-Well, I was...

24:44.892 --> 24:45.966
Wrong. You weren't thinking.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.735
No, sir. I mean, uh, yes, sir.

24:51.491 --> 24:53.549
Uh, Dr. Austin,

24:53.567 --> 24:55.234
that other stretcher
doesn't seem to be slowing down.

24:55.328 --> 24:57.811
Your finger in her femoral
artery is the only thing

24:57.905 --> 24:59.404
keeping her alive.
Figure it out.

24:59.499 --> 25:02.625
-Heads up! Move, move, move.
-On your right!

25:06.564 --> 25:08.747
-That was...
-AUSTIN: The bare minimum.

25:08.899 --> 25:10.082
Now, listen, I have no time

25:10.234 --> 25:11.509
for the stupidity
for which you are prone,

25:11.694 --> 25:14.253
so from here on out,
you do not talk, you do not move

25:14.421 --> 25:15.754
and you do not breathe

25:15.906 --> 25:18.257
-unless I give you
express permission.
-Yes, sir.

25:18.351 --> 25:19.666
I'll step it up.

25:19.760 --> 25:22.745
AUSTIN:
That was not me
giving you permission.

Phoebe's osmolar gap
is decreasing

26:16.909 --> 26:18.133
while her anion gap
is increasing.

26:18.152 --> 26:19.410

What if it's because
you can't actually see it?

26:41.767 --> 26:43.559

black light.

27:13.374 --> 27:14.873
Used it once at an escape room.

27:15.025 --> 27:17.860
An escape room, huh?
Let's give it a try.

27:17.862 --> 27:20.512
Turn off the lights.

27:23.050 --> 27:25.434
Moment of truth.

27:26.203 --> 27:28.962
There, around her mouth.

27:29.056 --> 27:30.981
Fluorescein.

27:37.139 --> 27:38.489
Some more around her fingers,

27:38.716 --> 27:41.325
which means if she consumed
something, we'd expect to see...

27:41.476 --> 27:42.475
Fluorescent urine.

27:42.495 --> 27:44.219
We can confirm
what this is at the lab.

27:44.238 --> 27:46.538

Yeah, but there's no doubt,
she was poisoned.

27:47.408 --> 27:49.241

We can help by, uh, pushing down

28:31.602 --> 28:33.452

some of the air.

You will do nothing of the sort.

29:46.768 --> 29:50.120

Get out of my sight, now.

29:52.941 --> 29:54.440
No, in fact...

29:54.535 --> 29:56.685
I want you to go
to the waiting room,

29:56.687 --> 29:58.111
and you explain
to this woman's family

29:58.280 --> 30:00.613
why she's even in the OR.

30:00.633 --> 30:04.426
And you give them
every last detail.

30:21.545 --> 30:24.137
(stammers)
Any news on our son?

30:24.231 --> 30:25.656
Uh, he's still in the OR.

30:25.807 --> 30:28.474
Our-our surgeons are doing their
best to repair his injuries,

30:28.569 --> 30:31.236
but his leg is shattered
in multiple places.

30:31.388 --> 30:33.238
W-Will he walk again?

MIRANDA:
Please, he's only 17.

30:36.727 --> 30:37.742
Teenage boys are stupid,

30:37.819 --> 30:40.704
but don't let him
be crippled for life.

30:40.856 --> 30:42.080
ALICIA:
At least he has a life.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.583
My family may not be so lucky.

30:44.677 --> 30:45.901
Let's go somewhere else.

30:45.919 --> 30:48.679
So they don't
have to face us? No.

30:48.848 --> 30:50.556
Look at us.

30:51.499 --> 30:53.016
See our pain.

30:54.094 --> 30:55.644
ALICIA:
How's my mother?

30:58.265 --> 31:00.415
There's been an accident
with Eileen.

31:00.434 --> 31:02.434
ALICIA:
What do you mean?

31:02.528 --> 31:03.694
What accident?

31:03.845 --> 31:05.237
Uh, she was getting better,

31:05.347 --> 31:09.157
and now there's a hole
in her artery.

31:10.018 --> 31:11.368
It was my fault.

31:11.519 --> 31:14.872
I tripped on the cannula,
it tore and she's in surgery.

31:15.023 --> 31:17.282
I am really sorry.

31:17.434 --> 31:20.377
Please, go ahead, yell at me.

31:20.528 --> 31:24.631
I deserve it.
I feel just terrible.

31:25.533 --> 31:26.717
The fault is ours.

31:27.961 --> 31:30.178
I bought him that car.

31:31.539 --> 31:35.392
It should have been me
who got hurt at the store.

31:37.471 --> 31:41.732
Mom wanted me
to work the register.

31:41.959 --> 31:43.567
I refused.

31:45.553 --> 31:49.072
We started fighting.
I said something awful.

31:49.224 --> 31:51.575
Turned to go.

31:53.728 --> 31:57.230
Mom pushed me out of the way
right when the car...

31:57.324 --> 31:59.157

31:59.251 --> 32:02.477
BRUNO:
It was Max's birthday.

32:02.496 --> 32:04.479
Miranda warned me.

32:04.498 --> 32:07.549
I begged you not to buy
that stupid car.

32:09.653 --> 32:11.503
I-I grew up poor.

32:11.655 --> 32:16.099
I wanted him to have
everything I never had.

32:18.328 --> 32:21.846
We came from Colombia
two decades ago.

32:21.999 --> 32:27.611

a life from the ground up.

everyone is okay,

32:36.271 --> 32:39.498
we'll help rebuild yours.

32:41.109 --> 32:43.185
Thank you.

when I see it.

33:06.727 --> 33:08.986

You'll feel a tiny pinch.

33:09.062 --> 33:10.729

BILLIE:
That's right.

33:26.396 --> 33:29.155
DEVON:
How long will it last?

33:29.174 --> 33:30.490
Several months.

33:30.509 --> 33:33.593
But if this pain recurs,
we can discuss next steps.

33:40.260 --> 33:42.477
AUSTIN:
It'll be enough.

33:48.101 --> 33:51.436
Uh, listen, um...

33:51.530 --> 33:54.197
my mother and I
want to thank you

33:54.366 --> 33:59.369
for the exceptional care
that you have provided.

33:59.521 --> 34:04.249
You've been nothing short
of remarkable.

34:05.494 --> 34:09.546
You've helped with some
really tough decisions

34:09.697 --> 34:15.368
and you have shown me the power
of compassionate comfort care,

34:15.462 --> 34:20.474
and-and I just want you
to know that it means a lot.

34:22.728 --> 34:26.063
It makes all the difference
in the world.

34:27.624 --> 34:30.975
And I know my mother will
hold all of you in her heart

34:31.128 --> 34:34.404
with the time that she has left.

34:39.653 --> 34:41.995

35:11.001 --> 35:12.667
Darling, we were so scared.

35:12.760 --> 35:14.569
We thought we might lose you.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.264
How long will she need
this machine?

35:18.283 --> 35:21.100
Well, that depends
on how her heart heals.

35:21.269 --> 35:22.953
But we're already
seeing improvement.

35:23.122 --> 35:24.287
(laughs softly)

35:24.514 --> 35:25.605
And the store?

35:25.624 --> 35:27.198
-Damaged.
-Oh...

35:27.351 --> 35:29.017
But we will rebuild.

35:29.186 --> 35:31.277
It'll be even better.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.521
This time, can we get
the shaved-ice machines?

35:33.523 --> 35:35.674
(soft laughter)

35:39.471 --> 35:42.213
Dr. Austin, please, I just
wanted to apologize again...

35:42.307 --> 35:44.123
Have I mentioned
that you are quite possibly

35:44.143 --> 35:45.958
the least promising intern

35:45.978 --> 35:48.052
to ever sully
the halls of Chastain?

35:48.147 --> 35:51.481
-Don't say that.
I really want to be better.
-Don't interrupt me.

35:51.708 --> 35:54.467
Now, I happen to know there
have been far worse interns

35:54.561 --> 35:57.303
who have gone on
to become fine doctors.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.805
You owned up to your mistake.

35:59.825 --> 36:02.159
That's a rare,
almost extinct virtue,

36:02.310 --> 36:06.571
and for that, I will not
kick you to the curb yet.

36:06.723 --> 36:08.665
Thank you, oh, thank you.

36:08.892 --> 36:11.168
Does this mean, uh,
could it be that you'll...

36:11.319 --> 36:12.394
let me back in your OR?

36:12.454 --> 36:14.896
I promise not to do
anything stupid.

36:14.989 --> 36:16.489
(elevator dings)

36:16.550 --> 36:19.492
Yeah, well, don't make
promises you can't keep,

36:19.586 --> 36:20.585
and I won't, either.

36:20.679 --> 36:24.181
So the answer is maybe.

36:29.337 --> 36:31.003
BELL:
We were able to repair

36:31.097 --> 36:33.415
your lacerated spleen
and your broken legs.

36:33.583 --> 36:35.358
In a few weeks,
you should be able to start

36:35.585 --> 36:37.752
working on getting
on your feet again.

36:37.771 --> 36:39.404
Thank you.

36:40.273 --> 36:42.106
Do you remember what happened?

36:42.201 --> 36:46.203
I drove too fast.

36:46.430 --> 36:47.537
I lost control.

36:47.689 --> 36:51.499
On a city street,
putting other lives in jeopardy.

36:54.862 --> 36:57.121
I'm ashamed.

36:57.274 --> 36:58.940
Is that what you needed to hear?

36:58.959 --> 37:00.700
We will need to hear
a lot more than that.

37:00.719 --> 37:05.430
You won't be driving
anything again for a long time.

37:10.044 --> 37:12.395
But I-I'm ashamed, too.

37:14.882 --> 37:17.108
For putting you behind
the wheel of that car.

37:20.630 --> 37:22.364
MIRANDA:
We love you.

37:23.558 --> 37:25.116
Always.

37:26.411 --> 37:29.471
But you and I both share
a responsibility for this.

37:29.564 --> 37:34.042
And we'll be helping the family
that you harmed to rebuild.

37:37.923 --> 37:38.997
Both of us.

poisoning with ethylene glycol.

37:57.167 --> 37:59.276
Commonly found in antifreeze,
it has an additive

37:59.427 --> 38:01.169
that fluoresces under UV light.

38:01.262 --> 38:02.612
It's a perfect murder weapon.

38:02.764 --> 38:04.764
Odorless, colorless, sweet,
masks as alcohol.

38:04.783 --> 38:07.784
-Someone made her drink it.
-She tried to get away...

38:08.011 --> 38:09.786
Yeah, and she fell down
the stairs.

38:09.937 --> 38:11.029
There is an antidote.

38:11.123 --> 38:12.864
We can save her with fomepizole.

38:13.033 --> 38:15.683
And we have proof
for an attempted homicide.

38:15.777 --> 38:19.045
Let's get security
to guard her room immediately.

38:21.967 --> 38:24.592
It's room 3350.

38:28.289 --> 38:29.431
Hey.

38:30.142 --> 38:31.683
What are you doing?

38:38.892 --> 38:41.609
He disconnected the vent and
turned off the heart monitor.

38:47.067 --> 38:48.641
No pulse. She's not breathing.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.702
-I'll start bagging.
-Call a code now!

39:13.334 --> 39:16.061
She was gone
by the time we got there.

39:17.189 --> 39:20.005
She wasn't breathing.

39:20.100 --> 39:22.692
And her heart had stopped.

39:22.919 --> 39:25.753
We tried...

39:25.847 --> 39:28.698
But we couldn't bring her back.

39:30.594 --> 39:32.852
I caused this.

39:33.020 --> 39:34.429
You didn't.

39:34.447 --> 39:36.598
She wasn't killed 'cause
you walked in asking questions.

39:36.616 --> 39:37.782
She was being blackmailed.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.435
Forced to not check
prescriptions.

39:40.453 --> 39:44.506
So, Phoebe agreed
to wear a wire for us.

39:45.867 --> 39:48.776
Someone must have found out.

39:48.795 --> 39:51.721
The Mafia always
takes retribution.

39:54.375 --> 39:56.518
That's why they killed her.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.604
This is even bigger
than we feared.

40:03.402 --> 40:05.652
We got a good look
at the killer.

40:06.796 --> 40:08.571
And he got a good look at you.

40:10.467 --> 40:12.492
You'll have to make a decision.

40:17.807 --> 40:20.333
Are you gonna leave Chastain?

40:24.831 --> 40:26.339
I don't want to.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.574
We don't want to lose you,

40:28.668 --> 40:30.743
but if you're in danger...

40:30.837 --> 40:32.654
"We"?

40:32.747 --> 40:34.055
Chastain.

40:35.917 --> 40:37.559
All of us.

40:38.419 --> 40:41.438
We got into it a bit today.

40:41.589 --> 40:43.022
Yes, we did.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.850
Friends again?

40:45.944 --> 40:47.193
Always.

40:48.613 --> 40:51.614
I love working with colleagues
who have strong opinions.

40:51.766 --> 40:53.950
Me, too.

40:54.101 --> 40:55.660
To a point.

40:56.604 --> 40:59.197
-Ditto.
-(chuckles)

40:59.349 --> 41:03.367
You made a questionable call
in the field; I did, too.

41:03.462 --> 41:06.871
From this point forward,
we have each other's backs.

41:06.998 --> 41:12.135
Whatever comes of this,
we fight this together.

41:29.062 --> 41:32.137
I want to thank you for
agreeing to hospice, Mom.

41:32.232 --> 41:34.565
I think you're going to like it.

41:34.659 --> 41:36.234
And this here is Janaya Purcell.

41:36.328 --> 41:38.236
She's your hospice nurse,

41:38.388 --> 41:40.830
and I think you're going
to like her, too.

41:40.982 --> 41:44.000
Lovely to meet you, Janaya.
Call me Carol.

41:44.227 --> 41:46.377
Let me help you with that.

41:47.897 --> 41:52.992
So, your son had me set up
everything for your return.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.902
-Mm.
-And...

41:54.996 --> 41:56.846
this is your new bed.

41:57.073 --> 41:58.756
The head and foot
both go up and down,

41:58.908 --> 42:01.242
and there is a railing
on one side

42:01.335 --> 42:04.169
that you can use to help you
get out of bed.

42:04.264 --> 42:07.415
But it's out here?
Not a bedroom?

42:07.433 --> 42:09.584
Yes, your son wants
to have you near,

42:09.602 --> 42:11.844
and it's closer
to the bathroom and kitchen.

42:11.863 --> 42:14.105
I put it by the window
to the garden

42:14.257 --> 42:16.774
-so you can watch the birds.
-Ah.

42:16.901 --> 42:18.535
(birds chirping)

42:18.762 --> 42:21.429
And this is your chair.

One button and it tips up
so you can get up.
