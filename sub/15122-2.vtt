WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:02.870
JIMMY: Good morning.

00:02.936 --> 00:05.273
I was just making sure you
were still breathing.

00:05.339 --> 00:08.008
You are...
in case you were wondering.

00:08.076 --> 00:09.243
I'm sorry your first
couple days here

00:09.310 --> 00:10.644
have been a little rough.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.713
Not only do I have no idea
what I'm doing,

00:12.780 --> 00:13.947
but my parents had me

00:14.014 --> 00:15.483
when they were 15,

00:15.549 --> 00:17.351
so they're pretty much
clueless as well.

00:17.418 --> 00:19.387
(cooing)

00:19.453 --> 00:21.021
And that thing
that happened yesterday

00:21.089 --> 00:22.490
with your Great-Great
Maw Maw...

00:24.092 --> 00:26.094
Mom!

00:28.028 --> 00:30.198
Ow! No biting!
(groaning)

00:30.264 --> 00:33.301
Let's just say, I promise
it will never happen again.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.470
MARCUS:
Jimmy!

00:38.572 --> 00:39.773
Hey.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.809
You want to go fake fight
on the bridge?

00:41.875 --> 00:43.644
We're going to throw each
other into the river

00:43.711 --> 00:45.846
and watch people freak
out as they drive by.

00:45.913 --> 00:47.115
Oh, man, that sounds awesome.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.449
Oh, I can't.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.184
You remember that girl
I got pregnant

00:50.251 --> 00:51.785
that murdered those people?

00:51.852 --> 00:52.820
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.088
They executed her.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.589
I got stuck with the baby.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.291
Not stuck-- didn't mean stuck.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.992
I'm cool with it.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.195
I got to watch what I say.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.197
I don't know if she
understands words yet.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.166
Anyway, I can't go
jump off a bridge.

01:05.233 --> 01:06.534
I got a baby now.

01:07.801 --> 01:08.669
* *

01:11.939 --> 01:13.841
* Whoo *

01:13.907 --> 01:15.843
* Here we go *

01:15.909 --> 01:17.178
* Oh, oh, oh *

01:17.245 --> 01:18.179
* Daddy-O *

01:18.246 --> 01:19.880
* Oh oh oh *

01:19.947 --> 01:21.115
* Let go *

01:21.182 --> 01:22.916
* Oh oh oh *

01:22.983 --> 01:24.252
* Like a jelly roll *

01:24.318 --> 01:26.254
* Oh oh oh *

01:26.320 --> 01:28.722
* Whoa *

01:28.789 --> 01:29.823
* Whoa *

01:29.890 --> 01:31.959
* Whoo *

01:32.025 --> 01:33.627
* Here we go *

01:33.694 --> 01:35.028
* Oh oh oh *

01:35.095 --> 01:37.731
* Oh oh oh *

01:37.798 --> 01:41.402
JIMMY:
Oh, sweet, you made
breakfast turtles.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.803
That's a good batch, too.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.205
It's going to give her
ham-and-eggtopuses

01:44.272 --> 01:45.506
a run for their money.

01:45.573 --> 01:47.107
How'd the second night
of sleeping go?

01:47.175 --> 01:49.076
Oh, she cried a few times,
but she settled down

01:49.143 --> 01:50.944
once I got in
the crib with her.

01:51.011 --> 01:52.680
You got in the
crib with her?

01:52.746 --> 01:53.914
For a little bit, yeah.

01:53.981 --> 01:55.316
Why, is that weird?

01:55.383 --> 01:57.050
It's a little weird.
It's a lot weird.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.852
JIMMY:
Well, I can't
just let her cry.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.621
I'm pretty sure
she already hates me.

02:00.688 --> 02:02.223
She never smiles.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.824
Yeah, I noticed that.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.727
I was making funny faces at her
last night for, like, an hour.

02:06.794 --> 02:07.828
Nothing.

02:07.895 --> 02:09.463
Ahh.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.501
Ahh.
Maybe she's
just a bitch.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.169
She's not a bitch.
Ahh.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.437
How do you know?

02:16.504 --> 02:18.939
She's the daughter
of a serial killer.

02:19.006 --> 02:21.875
Some of that evilness
has to be hermeditary.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.512
Hey, where's Mike's tent?

02:24.578 --> 02:27.448
Here.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.917
"Guys, met a chick,
joined a cult. Later."

02:29.983 --> 02:31.151
Again?

02:31.219 --> 02:33.687
I think he's
serious this time.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.789
He shaved his head.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.558
Ew. Not just his head.

02:37.625 --> 02:38.992
With your cousin Mike gone,

02:39.059 --> 02:40.828
I'm going to need you
to work twice as hard today.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.196
You might want to eat
an extra turtle.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.697
Oh, crap, work.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.299
I didn't even
think about work.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.301
What am I supposed
to do with the baby?

02:47.368 --> 02:49.270
Well, you'll figure
it out, man.

02:49.337 --> 02:52.273
Your mother and I both
worked when we had you.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.075
(rock music playing)

02:55.142 --> 02:56.076
See you tonight, Jimmy.

02:56.143 --> 02:57.645
* Ha *

02:57.711 --> 02:58.979
(door opens)

02:59.046 --> 03:01.249
(door closes)

03:01.315 --> 03:02.716
* Wanna mama *

03:04.452 --> 03:05.519
* Wanna mama *

03:06.620 --> 03:07.921
(snoring)

03:12.159 --> 03:13.527
* Wanna mama *

03:14.962 --> 03:16.397
* Wanna mama *

03:16.464 --> 03:18.332
I used to sit in front
of this thing for hours.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.468
I'd pretend the deer's parents
left him in the woods

03:20.534 --> 03:22.436
to stare at me
while they went to work.

03:22.503 --> 03:25.072
I'm sure that's what the
deer's parents would have
done if they'd had to.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.240
Guess I'll just have

03:26.307 --> 03:27.508
to take Hope to work with me.

03:27.575 --> 03:28.576
People do that, right?

03:28.642 --> 03:30.378
Bring their babies
to work?

03:30.444 --> 03:33.013
Yeah. I feel like
I've seen that.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.848
Morning, Wilford.
(slaps bottom)

03:34.915 --> 03:37.418
Gonna see if the milkman
has come yet.

03:37.485 --> 03:39.987
I'm not your dead husband,
Maw Maw.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.255
Whoa, hey.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.156
I thought I talked
to you about this.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.892
You can't smoke around the baby.

03:44.958 --> 03:47.328
Jimmy, smoke rises.

03:47.395 --> 03:49.897
She's not going to be
tall enough to breath it

03:49.963 --> 03:51.365
for a long time.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.733
Why don't you just quit?

03:52.800 --> 03:53.901
What?

03:53.967 --> 03:56.036
When we were young,
I thought it made you look

03:56.103 --> 03:58.272
like Dirty Sandy at
the end of Grease,

03:58.339 --> 04:01.842
but the older I get,
the less I'm enjoying
the taste of your mouth.

04:01.909 --> 04:02.910
Gross.

04:02.976 --> 04:03.877
( sighs )

04:05.846 --> 04:08.749
You going to get her
to quit smoking, too?

04:08.816 --> 04:12.286
'Cause as long as she's
exhaling, there's going to be
smoke in this house anyway.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.522
So if I get her to
quit, you'll quit?

04:17.291 --> 04:19.427
Sure.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.466
Maw Maw, how would you feel

04:25.533 --> 04:27.335
about quitting smoking?

04:28.769 --> 04:29.970
(groans)

04:33.307 --> 04:35.008
Good luck with that.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.188
Grab your baby.

04:48.255 --> 04:50.223
Let's get to work.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.360
* *

04:56.296 --> 04:57.998
* I've been down *

04:58.065 --> 04:59.700
* It seems
like never before *

04:59.767 --> 05:01.435
* I've been found *

05:01.502 --> 05:03.404
* Down on your
living room floor *

05:03.471 --> 05:06.707
* See I'm a general loser
that you can't understand *

05:06.774 --> 05:10.077
* And I'm a capital bruiser
on a government plan *

05:10.143 --> 05:11.645
* So I sit here *

05:11.712 --> 05:13.614
* And I wait up *

05:13.681 --> 05:15.849
* I'm always lost
and never been found *

05:15.916 --> 05:18.318
* When are you
coming around *

05:19.319 --> 05:21.855
* C-c-coming around *

05:23.924 --> 05:26.193
(siren whooping)

05:26.259 --> 05:28.095
No, I totally understand.

05:28.161 --> 05:32.065
Now that you point it out,
I do see how she could lose
a limb or be killed.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.502
I-I'll get day care
for her, I promise.

05:34.568 --> 05:37.070
You know, you could have
just said something to us.

05:38.305 --> 05:39.673
Tattletale!

05:43.243 --> 05:44.678
(nervous chuckle)

05:48.416 --> 05:49.417
Hello.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.519
Uh, Sabrina, right?

05:51.585 --> 05:53.253
Yeah. Oh, hey.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.088
Guy with the baby.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.024
It's Jimmy. My name is Jimmy.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.560
Am I crazy, or
did this place

05:59.627 --> 06:01.562
get a little cowboy-ish
since last week?
New owner.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.831
Apparently, he
thinks the customers
will buy more food

06:03.897 --> 06:06.299
if the employees look like
a bunch of jackasses.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.901
(chuckles)
Oh.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.269
Hey, check it out.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.639
That crazy lady comes in here

06:11.705 --> 06:12.740
with a roll of "day-old"
stickers

06:12.806 --> 06:14.408
and she puts them
on the new bread

06:14.475 --> 06:15.876
so she doesn't have
to pay full price.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.114
Well, it was nice
seeing you again.

06:21.181 --> 06:23.751
Jimmy, hold up.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.421
Hey, do you guys do discounts
on day-old anything else

06:27.488 --> 06:28.722
or is it just bread?

06:28.789 --> 06:30.424
Sorry, it's just bread.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.192
So is this your wife?

06:32.259 --> 06:33.461
Mom.
Mom?

06:33.527 --> 06:35.062
I had him when I was young.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.363
I don't recommend it.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.966
Thanks.
BARNEY: Sabrina, could you
giddyup over here

06:39.032 --> 06:40.300
with that step stool?

06:40.367 --> 06:42.503
I can't reach the top shelf
on Mustard's Last Stand.

06:42.570 --> 06:45.405
So is that her?
She's cute.

06:45.473 --> 06:47.441
Nice dumper.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.976
You gonna ask her out?

06:49.042 --> 06:49.910
Not with you here.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.579
You should ask her
if she baby-sits.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.246
Kill two birds with one stone.

06:53.313 --> 06:54.648
Let's just go.

06:54.715 --> 06:59.219
Did Jimmy tell you
he's looking for
a babysitter?

06:59.286 --> 07:00.654
You don't babysit, do you?

07:00.721 --> 07:02.322
No. My cousin
does, though.

07:02.389 --> 07:04.525
She runs a day care center
out of her parents' house.

07:04.592 --> 07:05.793
It's on the same street

07:05.859 --> 07:07.394
where the dancing
homeless guy hangs out.

07:07.461 --> 07:08.962
His name's Dan-- Dancing Dan.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.131
And he's, he's not our cousin.
Not our cousin.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.576
Jimmy, time to get up.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.712
Get that baby to day care.

07:28.882 --> 07:29.650
(sighs)

07:29.717 --> 07:31.485
That's weird, man.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.521
Weird.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.524
(techno-pop playing)

07:47.267 --> 07:49.069
Okay, Daddy's gonna leave you
at day care

07:49.136 --> 07:50.370
so he can go to work.

07:50.437 --> 07:51.839
But before I go,

07:51.905 --> 07:54.808
one little smile
to get me through the day.

07:54.875 --> 07:55.909
Come on.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.011
Come on.

07:58.078 --> 07:59.780
You're not going to smile,
are you?

07:59.847 --> 08:01.882
I know in prison that was
a sign of weakness,

08:01.949 --> 08:03.851
but you're out
in the real world now.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.519
It's okay
to let your guard down.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.087
(sighs)

08:07.154 --> 08:12.159
* And that's why we-ee-ee
don't eat glue. *

08:12.225 --> 08:15.128
Oh, my God, Jimmy?

08:15.195 --> 08:17.631
Excuse me?
It's me-- Shelly.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.700
I don't believe this.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.571
I don't believe it either.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.377
So you're going to call
me tomorrow, right?

08:30.443 --> 08:31.979
Shh.

08:36.550 --> 08:37.751
This is so weird.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.319
I, like, lost your number,

08:39.386 --> 08:40.688
and I didn't know how to...

08:40.754 --> 08:43.090
Wow, that was,
like, two years ago.

08:43.156 --> 08:45.192
I don't even...
You're probably married.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.259
Nope.
Boyfriend?

08:46.326 --> 08:47.828
Nope.
Wow.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.664
Wow, oh,
this is crazy.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.399
Well, I see you've been busy.

08:52.465 --> 08:53.934
Baby,

08:54.001 --> 08:56.804
but no ring on our finger?
(chuckles)

08:56.870 --> 08:59.006
Somebody's still
a naughty boy.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.073
(flinches)

09:00.140 --> 09:01.809
Um, yes, still naughty.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.177
Was naughty. Trying to
be less naughty now.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.013
I'm a dad setting
a good example.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.781
Anyway, I was looking
for day care,

09:07.848 --> 09:09.516
but I don't have
a ton of cash,

09:09.583 --> 09:11.251
so maybe this wasn't
even the best...

09:11.318 --> 09:12.820
Oh, no, are you kidding?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.622
For you, I think we could
work something out.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.857
You still like this?

09:16.924 --> 09:19.059
No! Ow! I don't
think that was me.

09:26.499 --> 09:29.202
I hope she did okay
on her first day.

09:29.269 --> 09:32.172
As soon as I get up there,
start honking the horn.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.942
I don't want to get stuck
talking to Shelly.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.548
Hey, looking good, Dan.

09:41.615 --> 09:44.885
Sorry you lost the election.

09:44.952 --> 09:48.155
I bet you would have made
a fine comptroller.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.389
SHELLY:
Oh, hey!

09:49.456 --> 09:50.457
Come on in.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.993
Oh, I can't. My dad's
really in a hurry.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.261
(tires squealing)
Whoo!

09:54.327 --> 09:55.629
(cackling)

09:55.696 --> 09:57.264
Oh, wow. He is in a hurry.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.899
Well, sit down.

09:58.966 --> 10:01.501
I was just getting ready
to sing a song to the troops.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.570
Oh. Great.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.172
After our little incident today,

10:05.238 --> 10:07.908
I think it's time we remind
ourselves about boundaries.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.210
So everybody pay attention.

10:11.544 --> 10:14.214
Rusty.

10:17.785 --> 10:21.354
* Sometimes things
can make you sad *

10:21.421 --> 10:24.892
* Sometimes things
can make you mad *

10:24.958 --> 10:26.760
* You might be
feeling mangy *

10:26.827 --> 10:28.896
* Or your diapers
might need changing *

10:28.962 --> 10:30.563
* Or your diaper
might need changing *

10:30.630 --> 10:31.965
* I don't know *

10:32.032 --> 10:34.367
* But whatever it is
that's got you grumpy *

10:34.434 --> 10:37.104
* A thorn in your paw
or a great big dumpy *

10:37.170 --> 10:41.574
* You need to stay calm
and follow my golden rule *

10:41.641 --> 10:42.710
* Don't bite *

10:43.744 --> 10:45.245
* Don't bite *

10:45.312 --> 10:47.314
* I know it's your way
of protection *

10:47.380 --> 10:49.416
* But bites can lead
to infection *

10:49.482 --> 10:53.253
* In some cases, it's
a form of affection... *

10:53.320 --> 10:54.187
(growls)

10:54.254 --> 10:55.388
(laughs)

10:57.657 --> 10:58.992
* But don't bite. *

11:01.428 --> 11:03.330
What the hell is that?

11:03.396 --> 11:04.097
Can't get her to quit.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.933
She burns me every time
I bring it up,

11:05.999 --> 11:08.535
so I built her a bubble.

11:08.601 --> 11:10.838
It's loosely based on the plans
that cousin Mike had

11:10.904 --> 11:12.773
when he was trying to invent
the walk-in bong.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.108
And technically, as long
as she stays in here,

11:15.175 --> 11:17.845
there's no smoke in the house.
So you have to quit.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.447
No, I don't. She gets a bubble,
I want a bubble.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.983
(door opens)

11:23.050 --> 11:25.986
Hello. Look who was nice enough
to give me a ride home.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.454
Hi, I'm Shelley.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.224
Jimmy and I hooked up
a while back.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.726
Just some kissing
and heavy petting.

11:32.793 --> 11:35.395
Nice to meet you.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.696
Well, thanks
for the ride.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.498
I should probably
get Hope to bed.

11:38.565 --> 11:39.666
I'll do it.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.601
I got her to take a nap
today, no problem.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.103
Then maybe then we
can go rent a movie.

11:43.170 --> 11:46.139
Who wants to go to Sleepytown?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.041
You want to go
to Sleepytown,
don't you?

11:48.108 --> 11:51.178
Okay, my fuzzy bunny, okay.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.112
Did you see that?

11:52.179 --> 11:54.281
She smiled.
Hope smiled at her.

11:54.347 --> 11:57.350
Huh. Maybe your baby's
not a bitch.

11:57.417 --> 11:58.418
Well, you're stuck

11:58.485 --> 11:59.853
with your dead-tooth
little girlfriend now.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.354
Not only is it
free day care,

12:01.421 --> 12:03.857
she's the only person
your kid likes.

12:03.924 --> 12:04.992
(chuckles)
(Maw Maw coughing)

12:05.058 --> 12:07.360
What's going on
in there?

12:07.427 --> 12:09.162
(coughing)

12:09.229 --> 12:11.965
That is a bit of
a design flaw.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.501
Hold your breath, Maw Maw.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.069
Help's on the way.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.776
Oh, uh, we can't go
to this register.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.177
It's 15 items or less.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.547
We've got movie rental
and a box of brownie mix.

12:27.614 --> 12:30.483
I'm not done shopping.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.054
Let's go.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.556
Don't worry. It's my cousin.
She won't care.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.558
Hey.
What up there, Paul?

12:38.625 --> 12:40.527
Baby guy.
Jimmy.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.095
Jimmy.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.497
Look at you two
hanging out.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.433
Yeah, well, she's watching
Hope now, so...

12:46.499 --> 12:47.935
Two years ago at a party,

12:48.001 --> 12:49.502
we got about
three-quarters of the way

12:49.569 --> 12:50.737
between second
and third base,

12:50.804 --> 12:52.973
and now we're practically
raising a baby together.

12:54.374 --> 12:55.442
Get a room, us!

12:55.508 --> 12:56.509
Not me. Still not me.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.744
This is wild.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.246
Yep, it's pretty wild,

12:59.312 --> 13:01.114
but we're probably
gonna take it kind of slow.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.851
Oh, condoms!
I forgot condoms.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.485
Sorry.

13:05.552 --> 13:06.820
I had no idea that

13:06.887 --> 13:08.121
you hooked up with my cousin.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.057
Seems like I've put you
in a bad situation.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.724
No, it's fine.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.561
Really? 'Cause you kind of have
this kidnapped-victim look

13:14.627 --> 13:16.096
in your eyes, like maybe

13:16.163 --> 13:18.365
you should be holding
a copy of today's newspaper.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.133
No, it's cool.
I mean, I don't know.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.668
It's, um, not...

13:21.734 --> 13:23.270
It's okay. She's cool.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.973
She's not charging me for
day care, so, so that's good.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.175
12-pack!
Purple, slim fit.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.311
(mouthing)

13:33.546 --> 13:38.418
Oh, man, Deuce Bigelow:
European Gigolo.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.121
I've been dying
to see this movie.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.289
You know, I'm off soon.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.656
Would you guys care
for some company?

13:43.723 --> 13:45.658
Yeah! Oh, that would be great!

13:45.725 --> 13:47.227
The more the merrier!

13:47.294 --> 13:49.029
I mean, if that's okay
with you.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.830
That's all right.
She won't see anything.

13:50.898 --> 13:52.565
We'll be under
a blanket.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.372
(boy grunting)

14:01.641 --> 14:03.043
Hey!

14:03.110 --> 14:04.711
Hey!

14:04.777 --> 14:06.213
Hey!

14:06.279 --> 14:07.881
(sotto voce):
Dia de muerto.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.382
Oh, you should have been
here, Jimmy.

14:09.449 --> 14:10.550
We almost
made a trash truck

14:10.617 --> 14:12.219
swerve into
some white chick on a moped.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.720
Oh, cool.

14:13.786 --> 14:15.255
You guys want
to come over?

14:15.322 --> 14:16.623
We're hanging out
at my house.

14:16.689 --> 14:17.958
Sure.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.126
These are my
best friends.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.461
Is that a deal
breaker with us?

14:21.528 --> 14:22.462
No way.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.066
(boys grunting)

14:28.435 --> 14:30.703
(hushed):
Right now?
She's coming over now?

14:30.770 --> 14:33.073
Soon. I've got Javier
and Marcus coming over, too.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.175
I figured you guys can
all keep Shelley busy

14:35.242 --> 14:36.709
while I spend some
time with Sabrina.

14:36.776 --> 14:39.046
Oh, and I need you to hide
all the blankets.

14:39.112 --> 14:42.549
All right. You need
to put a nicer shirt on. Go.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.752
Oh, see if you have something
with a V-neck.

14:45.818 --> 14:47.955
I'm seeing a lot
of V-necks lately.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.074
So...

15:07.140 --> 15:09.009
what's the deal with the
rotten chomper, sweetheart?

15:09.076 --> 15:11.178
Funny you should ask.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.346
I keep it
as a conversation starter.

15:15.082 --> 15:18.118
(soft reggae music playing)

15:20.153 --> 15:21.521
What are you doing?

15:21.588 --> 15:24.424
Waiting for your mother.

15:24.491 --> 15:25.258
Gross.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.060
We're gonna have sex.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.162
I realize that.
That's why I said "Gross."

15:29.229 --> 15:30.197
Can you shut the door?

15:30.263 --> 15:32.032
No. I shut the door,

15:32.099 --> 15:33.933
she forgets I'm
back here... waiting.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.235
(doorbell rings)

15:35.302 --> 15:37.670
* Look into my eyes *

15:37.737 --> 15:39.006
(mutter)

15:40.807 --> 15:41.808
Hey.
Hey.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.176
Sorry about being late.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.612
There was an accident
out on the bridge.

15:45.678 --> 15:46.813
Oh.
We brought beer.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.348
Great. Uh, you
need me to...

15:48.415 --> 15:50.583
We?
Oh.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.819
What's up?
What's up?

15:52.885 --> 15:54.487
Uh, Jimmy, this is
my boyfriend Wyatt.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.422
Wyatt, this is Jimmy.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.825
Cool V-neck.
Where'd you get it?

15:58.891 --> 16:00.860
My room.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.862
Hello.
(clears throat)

16:02.929 --> 16:05.365
Mom, uh, you met Sabrina.
Mmm.

16:05.432 --> 16:08.635
This is her boyfriend, Wyatt.

16:08.701 --> 16:09.936
Hey.
Hey.

16:10.003 --> 16:12.072
Nice to meet you.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.773
Boyfriend
and girlfriend, huh?

16:13.840 --> 16:16.076
How long's that
been going on,
a couple weeks?

16:16.143 --> 16:18.178
(chuckles)
No, a couple years now.

16:18.245 --> 16:21.081
Wow, that's great!

16:21.148 --> 16:22.482
So, Wyatt, what
do you do?

16:22.549 --> 16:24.284
You work at the
grocery store,

16:24.351 --> 16:25.652
you're a bag boy?

16:25.718 --> 16:27.820
No, ma'am.
I go to college in New York.

16:27.887 --> 16:28.755
I'm studying finance.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.458
(pats back)

16:32.592 --> 16:33.726
Come on in.

16:36.463 --> 16:37.664
(clears throat)

16:37.730 --> 16:38.631
(exhales)

16:40.467 --> 16:42.569
Hey, that dude cleans
my parent's pool.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.204
'Sup?

16:45.805 --> 16:47.174
(clears throat)

16:49.376 --> 16:52.011
* You make me want you
like I want you... *

16:52.079 --> 16:53.613
(all cheer)

16:53.680 --> 16:55.648
* ...make you want me
like you want me *

16:55.715 --> 16:58.218
* Do you want me tonight? *
(giggles)
Go, go, go.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.387
* I have to have you,
can I have you,
can I have you...? *

17:00.453 --> 17:02.255
Couldn't find any blankets

17:02.322 --> 17:05.125
Best I could do
was a beach towel.

17:07.427 --> 17:08.928
I don't want to do this.

17:08.995 --> 17:10.230
Is it the tooth?

17:10.297 --> 17:12.365
'Cause I've
got Wite-Out
in my purse.

17:12.432 --> 17:13.733
No, it's not the tooth.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.669
It's just, I like your cousin,
which is stupid

17:16.736 --> 17:18.305
because I know
that she has a boyfriend,

17:18.371 --> 17:20.407
but I can't help it.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.609
(sighs)
That's fine.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.211
Well, are-are you mad?

17:24.277 --> 17:27.547
Jimmy, we hooked up
at a party two years ago,

17:27.614 --> 17:29.482
you live with
your parents,

17:29.549 --> 17:32.152
you have a baby
and you clean pools
for a living.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.620
I think I'll
get over it.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.389
Does that mean
you'll keep watching Hope?

17:36.456 --> 17:38.591
'Cause she really likes you.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.161
In fact, you're the only
person she likes.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.396
'Course I will.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.100
For 60 bucks a week.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.437
(Hope cries)

17:50.503 --> 17:52.139
Excuse me.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.251
Hey, what's going on out here?

18:04.317 --> 18:05.752
I've had to rewind
our lovemaking cassette

18:05.818 --> 18:06.886
six times already.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.421
We gonna do this
or what?

18:08.488 --> 18:11.090
Sorry. They asked me to play,
and my team keeps winning.

18:11.158 --> 18:12.592
What are all
you guys doing

18:12.659 --> 18:13.526
in my backyard?

18:13.593 --> 18:16.396
And where is
my Buick Skylark?

18:16.463 --> 18:18.331
Uh-oh, somebody found
her marbles.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.932
Good, I've been
waiting for this.

18:19.999 --> 18:22.535
Maw Maw, I'm
your grandson-in-law Burt.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.771
You've lost your mind
and you're never lucid

18:24.837 --> 18:26.273
for very long, so listen up.

18:26.339 --> 18:29.108
I understand.
Go. Let's do this.

18:29.176 --> 18:32.412
We'd like you quit smoking.

18:32.479 --> 18:33.646
What are you talking about?

18:33.713 --> 18:35.715
You guys aren't letting me
smoke, are you?

18:35.782 --> 18:38.851
I quit smoking in 1971.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.052
You did?

18:40.119 --> 18:43.022
Yeah, I quit when
Virginia was born.

18:43.089 --> 18:45.124
You quit smoking for me?

18:45.192 --> 18:46.626
If you're Virginia, yeah.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.496
I wanted to live
long enough to see

18:49.562 --> 18:51.931
what you'd
grow up to be.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.866
Doesn't look like
it was worth the wait.

18:53.933 --> 18:54.967
Thanks.

18:55.034 --> 18:58.004
I guess you can die now.
You wish.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.307
That's why you're
letting me smoke:
you're trying to kill me.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.741
(gasps)
BURT: No one is trying
to kill you.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.576
And we won't let you
smoke anymore.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.712
In fact, since you're quitting,

19:05.778 --> 19:08.381
no one in this house
is gonna smoke anymore.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.623
Uh...

19:18.258 --> 19:19.659
Good luck with that.

19:27.133 --> 19:31.771
ALL:
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go, whoo!

19:39.111 --> 19:41.714
Hey.

19:41.781 --> 19:42.449
Hey.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.050
Brought you
some brownies.

19:44.116 --> 19:44.984
Her tooth may be dead,

19:45.051 --> 19:47.487
but her baking skills
are alive and well.

19:47.554 --> 19:51.224
Well, thanks.
Mmm.
(smacking lips)

19:51.291 --> 19:52.959
You okay?

19:53.025 --> 19:54.594
Uh, yeah. I mean,

19:54.661 --> 19:56.729
I'm bummed Sabrina
has a boyfriend,

19:56.796 --> 19:59.832
but I'm actually more
worried Shelley knows
I'm not into her.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.535
I got to figure out
how to pay for day care again.

20:02.602 --> 20:05.438
That's the funny thing
about having a kid.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.940
They come with their
own set of problems.

20:08.007 --> 20:08.975
Make everything else

20:09.041 --> 20:12.011
you were worried about
seem kind of silly.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.012
(Hope fussing)

20:13.079 --> 20:14.213
Shh...

20:22.789 --> 20:24.123
Here.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.292
What's this?

20:25.358 --> 20:28.828
My cigarette money.
(sighs)

20:28.895 --> 20:31.464
I want you to use it
to pay for Hope's day care.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.700
You're gonna quit smoking?

20:33.766 --> 20:35.702
Yep.

20:35.768 --> 20:39.306
I want to stick around
to see what you turn her into.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.510
I've had five beers,

20:43.576 --> 20:45.345
and that girl with
the crappy Chiclet

20:45.412 --> 20:46.813
is starting to look
pretty good.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.882
So, uh, you might
want to make your way

20:49.949 --> 20:51.784
into the bedroom pronto.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.322
I got to go
take care of this.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.457
Oh, gross.

20:59.892 --> 21:02.261
(Hope fussing)

21:02.329 --> 21:05.832
Somebody's got to go
to sleep soon, don't they?

21:05.898 --> 21:07.600
Yes, you do!

21:09.936 --> 21:11.371
(cooing)

21:11.438 --> 21:13.740
Mom, she did it!
She smiled at me.

21:13.806 --> 21:17.444
She likes me.
She finally likes me.

21:17.510 --> 21:20.513
Well, at least you
got one girl

21:20.580 --> 21:23.450
to fall in love
with you tonight.
(sighs)

21:23.516 --> 21:25.552
Don't you like me?

21:25.618 --> 21:27.019
Don't you like me so much?

21:27.086 --> 21:28.988
(cooing)

21:32.859 --> 21:35.795
(child giggling)
That was funny!
