00:24.457 --> 00:27.858
<i>I am here to find one lost soul.</i>

00:28.728 --> 00:32.027
<i>I have no interest in tyrants or heroes.</i>

00:33.366 --> 00:37.700
<i>Rather, I prefer the lives of smaller men.</i>

00:39.105 --> 00:41.596
<i>The ones left behind.</i>

03:54.000 --> 03:57.436
Hello, Serban.
Remember me?

03:59.305 --> 04:01.569
So, let me ask you...

04:01.641 --> 04:03.768
How did we do today?

04:05.979 --> 04:07.970
Rhetorical question.

04:12.819 --> 04:15.310
What have we got here?

04:19.259 --> 04:21.386
Serban, Serban.

04:22.962 --> 04:25.829
You need to realize, Serban...

04:26.566 --> 04:28.966
These make me real uneasy.

04:29.969 --> 04:33.268
See, if I take a shitcan
off the street with a tool.

04:33.339 --> 04:37.241
that's one more tool I need to worry about.
Understand what I'm trying to say to you?

04:37.310 --> 04:40.211
Shh, just nod.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.613
Good boy. Now...

04:44.550 --> 04:46.916
What else have you got?

04:48.655 --> 04:53.683
Not again. I do wish you'd stop shoving
things down your knickers, Serban.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.251
Makes me feel so cheap.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.326
Is that all?

05:01.834 --> 05:03.802
Promise?

05:04.804 --> 05:06.328
Well, then.

05:06.406 --> 05:09.398
I believe that completes
this evening's transaction.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.136
Serban.

05:12.845 --> 05:16.747
- See ya.
- Aah!

05:17.317 --> 05:19.581
Tell me something.

05:19.652 --> 05:23.884
Does your life
really flash before your eyes?

05:25.458 --> 05:27.949
I've gotta know.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.822
Until next time, Serban.

05:34.767 --> 05:37.634
Believe me, there will be a next time.

05:38.638 --> 05:40.936
Count on it.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.285
Psst!

07:06.359 --> 07:08.520
Get off my car.

07:11.831 --> 07:14.959
You want something?

07:16.002 --> 07:19.165
- Dani Simionescu?
- Who wants to know?

07:19.238 --> 07:21.763
John Riegert, Interpol.

07:23.976 --> 07:27.070
I was referred by your supervisor...

07:28.881 --> 07:31.611
Captain Radesgiascu?

07:32.452 --> 07:34.784
I need some assistance
on a case that just went local

07:34.854 --> 07:36.845
and he seems to think
you're the best man for the job.

07:36.923 --> 07:39.255
- Based on what?
- Two things really.

07:39.325 --> 07:44.092
Firstly, you've lived in London.
which makes you slightly easier on my ear.

07:44.163 --> 07:48.361
Second, they say you have -
and how shall I put this delicately? -

07:48.434 --> 07:53.201
a special rapport
with the street life around here.

07:53.272 --> 07:55.263
Really?

07:56.175 --> 08:00.111
- I'm not interested.
- You don't know what I'm selling yet.

08:00.179 --> 08:02.409
I'll tell you something. John.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.746
The first rule of the streets...

08:04.817 --> 08:06.978
Know your product.

08:26.873 --> 08:31.606
I don't suppose you engage
in a lot of high-speed chases?

08:50.429 --> 08:53.364
You can go home now, Allison.

08:53.933 --> 08:56.561
Really. Father, it's not a problem.

08:56.636 --> 08:58.797
It is for me.

08:59.805 --> 09:02.797
Good day. Don't forget to lock up.

09:18.691 --> 09:20.522
Father?

11:03.396 --> 11:07.093
Tell me more... Tell me more...

11:07.166 --> 11:10.158
Tell me how the world ends.

11:20.579 --> 11:23.275
No... it can't be.

11:57.950 --> 11:59.941
Father Constantin?

12:11.063 --> 12:13.395
Oh. God.

12:17.069 --> 12:20.095
So, what brought you back to Bucharest?

12:20.172 --> 12:23.164
- I'm sure you read my file.
- It says you were born here.

12:23.242 --> 12:27.178
But on first impressions.
you don't strike me as the nostalgic type.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.079
Your parents were killed by the secret
police six years before the revolution.

12:30.149 --> 12:33.710
Bad break for a kid of any age, I'm sure.

12:33.786 --> 12:36.550
Must feel a little weird
coming back to all this change.

12:36.622 --> 12:38.613
Look, am I dropping you off
somewhere or what?

12:47.199 --> 12:49.463
And that was...?

12:49.535 --> 12:51.799
Possible homicide.

13:01.046 --> 13:03.037
<i>Politia.</i>

13:09.655 --> 13:12.317
He was tossed from up there.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.526
Police, clear back.

13:34.180 --> 13:38.310
It's a local tradition
to leave a coin behind for the dead?

13:38.384 --> 13:40.545
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.852
Pays their way to heaven.

13:45.157 --> 13:47.148
Quaint.

13:48.260 --> 13:50.592
I... I knew him.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.595
He was... he was a dealer.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.397
Busted him a couple of times.

14:02.208 --> 14:04.608
Jesus.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.872
What happened to his heart?

14:32.371 --> 14:35.067
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

14:35.140 --> 14:38.439
- Are you sure?
- I said I'm fucking fine!

14:43.916 --> 14:48.410
I think you'll find that
the heart went missing before he fell.

14:52.124 --> 14:55.787
That part of your case profile.
is it. John?

15:41.607 --> 15:44.235
Hey, hey, don't shoot me.
We're in a church.

15:44.777 --> 15:45.937
Sorry.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.817
So who's your partner, Dani?

15:53.552 --> 15:55.747
John Riegert, Interpol.

15:55.821 --> 15:57.914
Miron lordache.

15:57.990 --> 16:00.049
And this is Valimorana Badila.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.583
But you can call us Laurel and Hardy.
Everybody else does.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.997
Pigeons.

16:09.068 --> 16:11.036
It's a big pigeon.

17:31.917 --> 17:33.908
Get away!

17:45.464 --> 17:47.932
I'll get help.

17:49.835 --> 17:51.735
What?

17:56.675 --> 17:58.506
I'll get help. OK?

17:58.577 --> 18:00.602
Just stay here.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.412
Thank you.

18:41.854 --> 18:44.880
Oh, I pulled the rap sheet
on the dead bloke - Serban Bachu.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.755
- I hope you don't mind.
- Why should I mind?

18:47.826 --> 18:52.024
Well, you say you busted Serban
once or twice. Drugs, I'd assume.

18:52.097 --> 18:54.190
Only I couldn't find a reference
to any such bust.

18:54.266 --> 18:58.669
Oh, well, you see, that's 'cause we're a little
bit shoddy on the old paperwork over here.

18:58.737 --> 19:00.705
Right.

19:00.772 --> 19:03.240
<i>Tell me, what's a rôtissoire?</i>

19:03.308 --> 19:05.435
<i>A rôtissoire.</i>

19:05.511 --> 19:09.777
Well, now, that's when you get a potential
suspect, you wrap him up in a bit of carpet.

19:09.848 --> 19:12.749
you beat seven bells of shit out of him.
no cuts, no bruises.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.844
just a tiny bit of internal bleeding.

19:17.723 --> 19:20.157
But, then again, you already knew that.
didn't you. John?

19:20.225 --> 19:22.989
Yes, I believe it was mentioned
in the complaint Serban lodged

19:23.061 --> 19:25.495
with the general inspector.

19:26.798 --> 19:31.292
I didn't do it.
if that's what you're driving at. John.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.361
You see, I like to see their faces.

19:33.438 --> 19:36.669
You're acting rather cavalier
for a man in your tenuous position.

19:36.742 --> 19:38.972
That's fucking it!

19:40.746 --> 19:43.579
Right, let's get one thing straight.

19:43.649 --> 19:46.277
I know when someone's trying to sweat me
and I don't fucking like it.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.184
so if you've got something to say.
say it to my fucking face.

19:49.254 --> 19:52.815
or you get the fuck out of my fucking car.

19:55.160 --> 19:58.857
I believe you're guilty of nothing more than

19:58.931 --> 20:01.764
a certain degree of moral ambivalence.

20:22.120 --> 20:26.682
Dreary little outpost
at the edge of the Holy Roman Empire.

20:26.758 --> 20:28.919
How unexceptional.

20:37.469 --> 20:40.495
<i>Love the apron. Belial.</i>

20:40.572 --> 20:43.040
Do you like it?

20:43.108 --> 20:45.633
You should grab yourself a body, Simon.

20:45.711 --> 20:48.202
They're to die for. Really.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.147
You eat, you fuck, you kill.

20:51.216 --> 20:53.616
And then you go home
and write poems all about it.

20:53.685 --> 20:55.710
<i>No, thanks.
I don't need the temptation.</i>

20:55.787 --> 21:00.656
Ooh. God's little choirboy.
You don't know what you're missing.

21:00.726 --> 21:02.284
<i>Neither do you.</i>

21:02.361 --> 21:05.228
Well, singing hymns
isn't really my thing, sweetie.

21:05.297 --> 21:07.788
I can't even carry a tune.

21:09.234 --> 21:10.701
So...

21:10.769 --> 21:14.170
I slog halfway around the world
searching for the book.

21:14.239 --> 21:18.039
only to find that
you knew where it was all along.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.305
And I thought we were friends.

21:20.379 --> 21:23.780
<i>You and I haven't been friends
for a very long time. Belial.</i>

21:23.849 --> 21:26.079
<i>Old grudges. mon ami.</i>

21:26.151 --> 21:29.552
Come on.
It's a new day out there.

21:29.621 --> 21:32.021
<i>Carpe diem and all that.</i>

21:33.025 --> 21:35.186
Nice work.

21:40.999 --> 21:45.629
Always good to have a monkey
do your heavy lifting, isn't it?

21:45.704 --> 21:49.003
<i>It's just a matter
of picking the right monkey.</i>

21:50.142 --> 21:52.804
<i>Where is it?
Where's the Lexicon?</i>

21:53.712 --> 21:55.839
<i>It's gone.</i>

21:57.783 --> 22:00.115
I don't suppose you know where?

22:00.919 --> 22:03.410
<i>It's in safe hands.</i>

22:03.488 --> 22:06.150
I will have that book, Simon.

22:22.507 --> 22:25.476
<i>Allison, it's Mom.</i>

22:25.544 --> 22:28.604
<i>Your brother Derek
says you've left town again.</i>

22:28.680 --> 22:31.649
<i>You have to keep taking your meds.</i>

22:31.717 --> 22:36.313
<i>Please, Allison.
If you're there, pick up the phone.</i>

22:36.388 --> 22:38.754
<i>- Please, Allison.
- Don't.</i>

22:38.824 --> 22:41.122
<i>I love you.</i>

22:41.193 --> 22:44.390
<i>That book
is everything to you now.</i>

22:44.463 --> 22:46.556
<i>Nothing else matters.</i>

22:47.199 --> 22:49.190
<i>Protect it.</i>

22:57.642 --> 23:01.100
<i>Don't shut out
the voices in your head, Allison.</i>

23:01.179 --> 23:03.670
<i>Not when you need them most.</i>

23:17.095 --> 23:19.757
<i>Someone is coming.</i>

23:19.831 --> 23:22.425
<i>By the time you know his face.
it'll be too late.</i>

23:22.501 --> 23:25.231
<i>He's always changing to avoid detection.</i>

23:34.112 --> 23:37.479
<i>You can't stay here.
Do you understand?</i>

23:38.450 --> 23:41.078
<i>He is going to rip you apart.</i>

23:46.792 --> 23:51.388
<i>Give me some kind of sign
that you understand what I'm telling you.</i>

24:01.606 --> 24:03.471
<i>That's my girl.</i>

24:16.621 --> 24:17.815
Here.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.929
So where exactly do you live?

24:30.001 --> 24:32.299
Just around the corner.

24:32.370 --> 24:35.567
I'll see you at the station house. 8am.

25:45.143 --> 25:46.872
What happened?

25:46.945 --> 25:49.209
I think I just cut my fingers off.

25:49.281 --> 25:51.181
Why?

25:51.249 --> 25:52.739
He told me to.

25:53.151 --> 25:54.618
Who?

25:54.686 --> 25:56.881
The man in the black coat.

25:59.057 --> 26:02.026
I'll take you to the hospital.

26:04.596 --> 26:06.928
Un-fucking-believable.

26:09.935 --> 26:12.369
Laurel, it's me, it's Dani.

26:12.437 --> 26:16.635
Yeah, I need you to run a facial rec on
a John Riegert through Interpol's database.

26:16.708 --> 26:20.701
See what you come up with. Yeah, well.
he doesn't check out with me, all right?

27:09.628 --> 27:12.859
- I thought we said 8am.
- No, you said 8am.

27:12.931 --> 27:17.197
You're upset.
Did something happen last night?

27:17.268 --> 27:18.758
Not really.

27:18.837 --> 27:22.534
Just some nut bag cuts his fingers off
with a rusty tin of pilchards

27:22.607 --> 27:25.371
because someone tells him to.

27:26.378 --> 27:29.211
- Same old same, really.
- Good.

27:30.348 --> 27:32.509
Let's move on.

27:44.462 --> 27:47.625
So what we got?

27:48.166 --> 27:51.033
Her name is Carmen Macovei.

27:51.102 --> 27:54.663
She was selling
secondhand clothes on Silvestru.

27:54.739 --> 27:57.674
Her husband was reporting her missing
three days ago.

27:57.742 --> 28:00.108
It seems she used a nail file on herself.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.510
Nice touch.

28:03.381 --> 28:05.747
Don't bother looking for the heart.

28:05.817 --> 28:08.308
He always takes it.

28:09.354 --> 28:12.653
They say it's the seat of the human soul.

28:25.003 --> 28:26.994
Can I help you?

28:28.506 --> 28:31.339
Father Constantin.
where is he?

28:31.409 --> 28:34.674
Oh, I'm sorry, but we are still
preparing him for the viewing.

28:34.746 --> 28:37.078
No visitors are allowed.

28:39.651 --> 28:41.551
- How do you stand it?
- I'm sorry.

28:41.619 --> 28:43.382
All this death?

28:43.455 --> 28:48.085
I think that I am
helping the dead pass to a better place.

28:52.464 --> 28:57.128
Well, here.
Have a taste of that better place, Gloria.

29:04.175 --> 29:06.166
On me.

29:35.907 --> 29:39.138
Forgive me. Father.
for I have sinned.

29:39.210 --> 29:41.201
Endlessly.

29:44.649 --> 29:46.480
What am I doing?

29:46.551 --> 29:48.985
I'm trying on a new skin suit...

29:50.188 --> 29:52.679
Florin.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.452
Shh.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.757
Shh.

30:00.832 --> 30:02.823
That's right.

30:53.985 --> 30:56.579
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a cop.

31:15.974 --> 31:18.408
Good, good, good, good, good.

31:24.082 --> 31:26.073
By what?

31:30.221 --> 31:31.779
What kind of entities?

31:36.561 --> 31:39.655
Come on. Joe.
I want to know what you call them.

31:45.937 --> 31:49.896
Good ones or bad ones?

31:54.279 --> 31:56.907
What? What of them?

31:56.981 --> 31:59.677
What do you mean by that?

32:03.721 --> 32:06.781
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't you go. Joe. Don't you go.

32:09.994 --> 32:12.224
Don't you go.

32:17.702 --> 32:19.294
Damn!

32:20.305 --> 32:22.239
Hey!

32:22.307 --> 32:26.403
You seemed so absorbed.
I didn't want to break your concentration.

32:26.477 --> 32:32.416
- Do you want a lift or something?
- Only if you're not too busy chatting.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.609
Right.

32:43.394 --> 32:48.627
Look, can you refresh my memory?
Where exactly are you staying?

32:49.834 --> 32:54.635
- Oi, where do you wanna be dropped off?
- Keep going.

32:54.706 --> 32:59.973
- Yeah, but the last time I dropped you off...
- I'm staying somewhere else now.

33:00.044 --> 33:02.035
Genius.

33:03.681 --> 33:05.672
Turn here.

33:34.645 --> 33:38.012
What's all this about, then?

33:38.082 --> 33:41.017
Bring a crowbar.

33:42.820 --> 33:48.122
This better have something to do
with the case, you understand me?

34:00.905 --> 34:03.533
- No one's here.
- There will be.

34:13.051 --> 34:16.020
What exactly are we looking for?

34:16.087 --> 34:19.056
This was a country house for the party elite
back in the days of the communists.

34:19.123 --> 34:21.114
Am I right?

34:24.562 --> 34:25.790
Yeah.

34:25.862 --> 34:28.797
Only it was more than that, wasn't it?

34:28.866 --> 34:34.065
It was also an informal headquarters
for the secret police.

34:36.706 --> 34:38.697
Dani.

34:39.710 --> 34:41.871
I could use some light down here.

34:57.662 --> 35:00.324
I'm gonna give you exactly ten seconds

35:00.398 --> 35:03.026
for you to tell me
what we're doing down here,

35:03.101 --> 35:06.093
or I swear to you, I'm gone.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.661
Please try to maintain
your professional detachment.

35:08.739 --> 35:10.707
Nine.

35:10.775 --> 35:12.675
Eight.

35:12.743 --> 35:15.541
- The past is speaking to us.
- Seven.

35:16.347 --> 35:18.212
Six.

35:18.282 --> 35:19.977
Five.

35:20.051 --> 35:21.712
Four.

35:24.355 --> 35:26.255
Three.

36:54.412 --> 36:56.903
You remember that day.

36:59.083 --> 37:03.486
There was a man in a pressed black suit.
round glasses. His name was Treptow.

37:03.554 --> 37:06.887
He met your parents
in the waiting room.

37:10.361 --> 37:15.162
<i>Your parents, it seems.
had been identified as subversives.</i>

37:15.233 --> 37:17.667
<i>Enemies of the state.</i>

37:17.735 --> 37:20.226
<i>They never knew
why they were accused.</i>

37:20.304 --> 37:22.431
<i>or by whom.</i>

37:22.506 --> 37:24.736
<i>But at that moment.</i>

37:24.809 --> 37:28.609
<i>they knew they would never
see each other again.</i>

37:28.679 --> 37:31.807
<i>What they couldn't possibly know</i>

37:31.882 --> 37:37.252
<i>is how their tiny, forgotten lives would one
day change the balance of the universe.</i>

37:37.321 --> 37:42.452
<i>beginning with one terrified little girl.</i>

37:55.339 --> 37:58.900
<i>Your mother would die
before giving up her youngest.</i>

38:02.380 --> 38:05.941
<i>The little girl had suffered
a terrible cut to her face.</i>

38:06.017 --> 38:08.645
<i>But it was that very injury
that proved her salvation.</i>

38:08.719 --> 38:12.985
<i>since it allowed the nurse
to remove her for emergency treatment.</i>

38:26.337 --> 38:32.071
<i>The child was spirited
out of the country the very next day.</i>

38:32.143 --> 38:37.080
<i>Listed as an orphan
for the benefit of 1.000 needful mothers.</i>

38:55.499 --> 38:57.490
You know why
you weren't exterminated that day

38:57.568 --> 39:01.504
alongside your devoted
mother and father, don't you?

39:01.572 --> 39:03.665
Of course you do.

39:03.741 --> 39:06.972
- You turned them in.
- No.

39:07.044 --> 39:10.673
But you can't be blamed. Really.

39:10.748 --> 39:15.151
You were just a child.
doing as you were taught in school.

39:15.219 --> 39:19.155
Learning to spot enemies of the state
wherever they might lurk.

39:19.890 --> 39:22.222
However close to home.

39:24.495 --> 39:26.986
Who are you?

39:27.064 --> 39:30.795
Is it any wonder
you still commit routine acts of torture

39:30.868 --> 39:33.769
in the commission of your daily job?

39:33.838 --> 39:38.468
Did you really think that, by coming back
here after the communists fell.

39:38.542 --> 39:41.534
all this would simply be forgotten?

40:05.336 --> 40:11.275
It must have been ripped from your
mother's hands as she was dragged away.

40:24.488 --> 40:27.082
What the fucking hell were those things?

40:27.158 --> 40:29.126
- I told you, the past.
- What?

40:29.193 --> 40:31.991
You'd probably call them ghosts.

40:32.062 --> 40:35.429
Understand this house
does not give up its dead, Dani.

40:35.499 --> 40:41.267
The atrocities committed here
will echo forever inside those walls.

40:55.920 --> 41:00.619
Thanks for coming all the way out here,
lon. I just didn't know who else to call.

41:00.691 --> 41:04.092
- The night that Father Constantin died...
- God rest his soul.

41:04.161 --> 41:08.029
...well, he had a book in his hand.
A Bible.

41:08.098 --> 41:13.900
But there was writing in it
that wasn't part of the regular scripture.

41:16.040 --> 41:18.338
The words were writing themselves.

41:18.409 --> 41:20.775
Allison, Allison.

41:20.845 --> 41:23.712
A double "Allison. " that's rough.

41:23.781 --> 41:25.510
OK.

41:26.717 --> 41:28.912
Knock yourself out.

41:28.986 --> 41:32.752
All the way to the back.
the end of Revelations.

41:39.663 --> 41:43.429
You don't see it, do you?
I really am a nut case.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.833
- It's not that.
- What is it then?

41:47.505 --> 41:49.632
I think I'm going to faint.

41:49.707 --> 41:52.073
Then you do see it.

41:52.676 --> 41:56.009
There's a school of thought.
very marginalized.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.446
but it's been around for centuries.

41:58.516 --> 42:01.451
- lon, you're...
- Oh, yeah.

42:01.519 --> 42:04.511
Yeah, I get them a lot.
It's nothing.

42:05.923 --> 42:08.915
Anyway, the thinking goes that...

42:10.928 --> 42:14.796
Revelations is not just
the last chapter of the Bible.

42:14.865 --> 42:17.265
It's still incomplete.

42:17.334 --> 42:19.165
Incomplete? How?

42:21.338 --> 42:24.205
Awaiting further dictation from God.

42:25.042 --> 42:27.135
- You think...
- There's supposed to be this book. OK?

42:27.211 --> 42:30.009
<i>It's called the Prophets' Lexicon.</i>

42:30.080 --> 42:33.516
Whoever is chosen to carry it.
basically...

42:33.584 --> 42:35.575
Basically what?

42:35.653 --> 42:39.350
Holds the fate of humanity
in their hands.

42:42.826 --> 42:45.056
No, it is not me.

42:45.663 --> 42:47.893
It's not me.

42:47.965 --> 42:50.058
Don't look at me like that.

42:51.635 --> 42:53.068
Just...

42:53.137 --> 42:55.332
just a second. Sorry.

42:55.406 --> 42:57.567
I'll be back.

43:22.700 --> 43:24.395
Hurry up, lon.

43:39.750 --> 43:41.911
Oh, come on.

43:41.986 --> 43:43.977
<i>He's coming.</i>

43:45.856 --> 43:49.155
<i>He is a demon named Belial
and he is going to kill you.</i>

43:49.226 --> 43:50.716
Belial.

43:50.794 --> 43:53.319
<i>Don't stop to wonder how or why.</i>

43:53.397 --> 43:54.955
<i>Just go.</i>

44:20.257 --> 44:25.854
<i>If you've ever trusted the voices
in your head before, trust them now.</i>

44:28.999 --> 44:30.933
Allison.

44:32.770 --> 44:34.203
Allison.

44:48.619 --> 44:50.018
Simon.

45:10.240 --> 45:12.572
We have to go now.

45:13.644 --> 45:16.306
We need to get to your sister.

45:17.881 --> 45:20.441
My sister?

45:20.517 --> 45:22.508
She's alive.

45:23.520 --> 45:26.455
And living in this city.

45:29.526 --> 45:31.858
She's alive?

45:34.465 --> 45:38.265
And what does she have to do
with any of this. John?

45:43.574 --> 45:46.372
She has everything to do with this.

45:48.245 --> 45:51.078
She's at the heart of a prophecy.

45:52.483 --> 45:54.314
Prophecy?

45:56.086 --> 45:57.576
What?

45:58.388 --> 46:01.915
What the fuck
are you talking about. John?

46:01.992 --> 46:05.689
Let's just say in some vast.
overreaching, cosmic sort of way.

46:05.763 --> 46:08.288
she drew short straw.

46:09.266 --> 46:12.702
You know what?
I'm tired.

46:12.770 --> 46:14.829
I'm tired of this.

46:14.905 --> 46:17.373
Don't talk to me.
Don't follow me.

46:17.441 --> 46:21.275
In fact, don't even fucking look at me!

46:37.494 --> 46:39.985
I told you, piss off!

46:41.031 --> 46:43.022
Go away!

46:54.178 --> 46:57.443
- We need to find your sister.
- Leave me alone.

46:57.514 --> 47:00.142
- Phone.
- What?

47:06.557 --> 47:07.080
Yeah.

47:07.157 --> 47:10.854
<i>Where have you been?
I've been trying to reach you all day.</i>

47:10.928 --> 47:12.828
<i>- What you got?
- I have...</i>

47:12.896 --> 47:16.354
run the facial recognition.
like you asked me.

47:16.433 --> 47:18.993
and I have files
from seven different cases.

47:19.069 --> 47:22.732
Your man is a real tourist.
Malta. Afghanistan.

47:22.806 --> 47:26.037
<i>- Cuba. Tibet. Belize.
- And?</i>

47:26.109 --> 47:29.237
<i>Six of the seven photos
were taken from the last few years.</i>

47:29.313 --> 47:32.646
- And the other?
- This one is a real nut case.

47:32.716 --> 47:35.116
It does no sense to me.

47:35.185 --> 47:37.619
It's from the Securitate files.

47:37.688 --> 47:41.852
<i>Right here in Bucharest.
Dated in '86. November.</i>

47:41.925 --> 47:44.018
No.

47:44.094 --> 47:46.961
It can't be.
It's gotta be a different John Riegert.

47:47.030 --> 47:50.431
Not if you're looking
at the same photo I'm looking at.

48:03.380 --> 48:06.315
Your mother didn't weep for you, Dani.

48:06.383 --> 48:08.749
Not then.

48:08.819 --> 48:11.344
But she weeps for you now.

48:15.592 --> 48:19.756
You can hear it every time
you close your eyes, can't you?

48:23.734 --> 48:26.225
Tell me who you are.

48:27.704 --> 48:30.434
Are you sure
that's what you really want?

49:05.409 --> 49:07.741
I'm sorry. Father.

49:15.752 --> 49:20.212
This is... this is fucking insane.
Why should I believe you?

49:20.290 --> 49:24.090
Because nothing will ever
make sense to you again if you don't.

49:25.662 --> 49:27.687
I need your help, Dani.

49:27.764 --> 49:31.097
But more than that, you need mine.

49:31.902 --> 49:37.340
You have to understand that, to an angel.
just like man, the Word is everything.

49:38.175 --> 49:41.542
Like you, we have fought
terrible wars over its meaning.

49:41.611 --> 49:44.774
And just like you, we have
created divisions among ourselves

49:44.848 --> 49:47.510
that are not
what you might call convenient.

49:47.584 --> 49:50.144
Like... like heaven and hell?

49:50.220 --> 49:52.848
Yes, but now there is a book.

49:53.457 --> 49:57.518
<i>A version of your Holy Bible
that can end that dispute forever.</i>

49:57.594 --> 50:02.657
<i>Because it will contain what is essentially
the last word, the final revelation.</i>

50:02.733 --> 50:06.965
<i>It's not yet complete, but when it is.
whosoever has that book</i>

50:07.037 --> 50:10.734
<i>will have an insurmountable advantage
over the rest of us.</i>

50:10.807 --> 50:12.468
<i>Yes.</i>

50:12.542 --> 50:18.174
<i>He'll know which horse to bet on
before the last race is even won.</i>

50:18.248 --> 50:23.276
Or which horse to kill
if he wants a different outcome, right?

50:23.353 --> 50:25.753
Spoken like an angel.

50:26.323 --> 50:29.952
That book decides the future for us all.

50:30.027 --> 50:33.793
And you're saying
that my sister's got this book?

50:33.864 --> 50:35.229
Yes.

50:35.298 --> 50:38.233
Right. And where did she get it?

50:38.301 --> 50:40.895
She was the choice
of an angel named Simon.

50:40.971 --> 50:43.098
An angel named Simon?

50:43.173 --> 50:46.506
And why?
Why did Simon choose my baby sister?

50:46.576 --> 50:50.603
<i>Broken people
make the best pawns, Dani.</i>

50:50.680 --> 50:56.312
Just say I believe
just half of what you're telling me...

50:56.386 --> 50:58.980
How do I know what side you're on?

50:59.056 --> 51:03.322
Whether you're one of the good ones
or one of the fucking bad ones?

51:03.393 --> 51:05.520
Look around.

51:05.595 --> 51:07.790
Look at yourself, Dani.

51:07.864 --> 51:11.425
Do you really think
those distinctions still apply?

51:11.501 --> 51:15.631
Right now, for your good and the good
of your kind, you have to look at me

51:15.705 --> 51:19.141
as the lesser of two evils.

51:30.954 --> 51:33.787
Derek.
Hey, it's Allison.

51:33.857 --> 51:37.987
Look, I...
I just need to ask you a question. OK?

51:38.995 --> 51:41.725
What do you know about Belial?

51:41.798 --> 51:43.789
Yeah, the demon Belial.

51:43.867 --> 51:47.268
No, please don't ask me why.
Please.

51:47.337 --> 51:50.170
I just need you to help me. OK?

51:51.374 --> 51:55.208
Thank you. Derek. Thank you.
thank you, thank you. You rock.

51:55.278 --> 51:58.770
Yeah, just call me back at this number.
Room eight.

51:58.849 --> 52:00.510
Thanks.

52:44.895 --> 52:46.658
Why did you just do that?

52:46.730 --> 52:51.167
Because he'll be dead of an overdose
in the next three hours.

52:51.234 --> 52:53.964
Paying his way to heaven.

52:59.009 --> 53:00.874
It was you.

53:00.944 --> 53:02.878
You were there.

53:02.946 --> 53:05.141
That night.

53:05.215 --> 53:07.149
At the church.

53:12.956 --> 53:16.414
You killed Serban.
You pushed him out of the tower.

53:16.493 --> 53:19.053
I wanted you to feel
personally involved in the case.

53:19.129 --> 53:22.621
You fucking son of a bitch.
You used me.

53:22.699 --> 53:25.167
I just finished what you started.

53:25.235 --> 53:29.638
As you say.
one more scumbag off the street.

53:29.706 --> 53:33.437
- You killed them all, didn't you?
- No. Just the one.

53:35.378 --> 53:37.710
Quick word.

53:40.717 --> 53:42.378
Yeah.

53:44.854 --> 53:46.845
Excuse us.

53:51.061 --> 53:53.928
- Right. What we got?
- We got a man.

53:53.997 --> 53:58.229
A few witnesses saw him in a café toilet
shortly before the last victim was found

53:58.301 --> 54:00.462
with his face in a sink
and without his heart.

54:00.537 --> 54:02.596
who we know is an undertaker

54:02.672 --> 54:06.631
who is missing from his funeral home since
yesterday afternoon. You understand me?

54:06.710 --> 54:09.235
- No, no. I don't understand.
- It doesn't matter.

54:09.312 --> 54:14.011
The point is, the suspect is content
to confess to killing the undertaker.

54:14.084 --> 54:17.349
And get this. He's a priest.

54:17.420 --> 54:21.083
This thing is more like
some kind of a cult or something.

54:21.157 --> 54:25.423
- Right, I want to talk to him now.
- Can't. He'll only talk to Riegert alone.

54:25.495 --> 54:29.056
Which brings us right back
to the question du jour.

54:29.132 --> 54:32.761
Who the fuck is John Riegert?

55:02.432 --> 55:06.027
Don't tell me, first one to blink
loses... and we all go home.

55:10.040 --> 55:12.668
<i>I know where she is.</i>

55:12.742 --> 55:14.937
<i>It's just a matter of time now.</i>

55:15.745 --> 55:19.579
- Have you won her over?
- I haven't had the chance.

55:19.649 --> 55:21.139
Yet.

55:21.217 --> 55:23.617
But I will.

55:24.454 --> 55:26.888
Who are they talking about?

55:27.857 --> 55:30.587
You can still come back.

55:30.660 --> 55:33.060
- This can all be undone.
- No, it can't.

55:36.833 --> 55:40.496
Nice move, by the way.
recruiting the girl's brother.

55:41.071 --> 55:44.063
<i>I never would have considered that.</i>

55:48.411 --> 55:50.470
<i>Frankly, I expected more of a scuffle.</i>

55:50.547 --> 55:55.143
but, then again, you do have
a lot of self-imposed limitations here.

55:55.218 --> 55:57.846
Hardly even makes a game of it.

55:57.921 --> 56:01.357
Don't worry.
I think I can keep it interesting.

56:01.424 --> 56:03.858
I do hope so.

56:03.927 --> 56:06.259
For old times' sake.

56:09.432 --> 56:11.332
Is it me
or is it getting a bit chilly in here?

56:11.401 --> 56:13.596
Last chance. Belial.

56:15.939 --> 56:21.036
It's going to be a cold day
when I submit to you...

56:21.111 --> 56:22.578
John.

56:23.446 --> 56:27.109
A very, very cold day.

56:32.622 --> 56:35.614
This one's something of a bleeder.

56:40.497 --> 56:43.022
He's having a seizure!

56:46.736 --> 56:48.897
Get the doctor here, quick!

56:58.615 --> 57:01.812
Must have been something I ate.

57:05.155 --> 57:07.589
What the hell...?

57:23.273 --> 57:25.764
Did...
did you see what hit the mirror?

57:25.842 --> 57:28.606
Somebody tell me they saw what I saw!

57:32.015 --> 57:36.748
That won't be necessary.
I believe you need one of these.

57:39.122 --> 57:42.580
- Hey, where are we going?
- I have to go.

57:42.659 --> 57:46.095
- Why do you talk like that?
- Sorry, but I have to go.

57:46.162 --> 57:47.993
- Something's wrong?
- No, nothing's wrong.

57:48.064 --> 57:49.793
- You're sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

57:49.866 --> 57:51.731
Then what am I
supposed to tell the captain?

57:51.801 --> 57:54.827
Tell him anything you like.

57:57.440 --> 58:01.035
Now, was that really necessary?

58:01.110 --> 58:04.477
Trust me, you never want to see a body
alive after the soul has been discarded.

58:06.483 --> 58:08.007
Oh, no, no, no.

58:08.084 --> 58:10.518
I got it. I got it.
Go. Thanks very much.

58:10.587 --> 58:13.818
Could somebody please bring me a towel?

58:14.991 --> 58:19.052
From here on.
you need to understand something.

58:19.128 --> 58:20.959
What?

58:21.931 --> 58:25.094
You need to understand
that if you haven't stopped following me

58:25.168 --> 58:28.535
by the time I get
to the top of these stairs.

58:28.605 --> 58:31.369
I'm going to have to
put a bullet through your head.

58:31.441 --> 58:33.636
What the hell is wrong with you?

58:34.244 --> 58:36.610
You do realize
that they will be keeping you in custody

58:36.679 --> 58:40.046
till you come up with some
half-reasonable explanation

58:40.116 --> 58:43.847
why you've got someone's
beating heart in your hand?

58:43.920 --> 58:47.356
- Any suggestions?
- Um...

58:47.423 --> 58:48.913
No.

58:49.759 --> 58:52.023
No, I can't get you out of this one.

58:52.095 --> 58:55.656
And... and you can't just
waltz straight out of here either.

59:05.041 --> 59:08.943
Now might be a good time
to waltz right out of here.

59:15.218 --> 59:16.412
Derek?

59:16.486 --> 59:19.080
Hey, what have you got for me?

59:19.656 --> 59:21.385
OK.

59:24.193 --> 59:29.358
All right, so that means that
he's part of Satan's legion.

59:31.067 --> 59:32.056
Uh-huh.

59:36.806 --> 59:39.570
Uh-huh. Are you sure?

59:41.177 --> 59:45.170
<i>- No, I just...
- Think back, Allison.</i>

59:47.183 --> 59:48.775
<i>Remember.</i>

59:48.851 --> 59:53.185
It just doesn't make any sense to me.
Derek, I-I don't understand.

59:53.256 --> 59:55.952
How can he be a purer evil than Satan?

59:57.794 --> 01:00:02.959
Yeah, I know it's just
the ravings of drunken monks. I do, but...

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:06.897
<i>You're not safe here.</i>

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:09.700
You know. Derek.
I really gotta get going.

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:14.368
No, you can't call me here because I'm not
gonna be here anymore after tonight.

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:18.813
Yes, I will call you, I promise.
As soon as I get a chance. OK?

01:00:18.881 --> 01:00:22.078
All right.
Tell Mom and Dad that I'm OK.

01:00:22.151 --> 01:00:24.142
OK, bye-bye.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:29.516
<i>Good girl.
Now look down.</i>

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:37.530
Oh, my God.

01:00:52.882 --> 01:00:54.873
Cold day.

01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:56.714
Brilliant.

01:01:02.191 --> 01:01:05.285
So, who exactly are we looking for?

01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:08.626
- The one you call Laurel.
- How can you be so sure it's in him?

01:01:08.698 --> 01:01:11.724
He's the only one unaccounted for.

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:16.397
Please don't make me do your job.
I have enough to do already.

01:01:16.472 --> 01:01:18.463
Turn left up here.

01:01:20.543 --> 01:01:24.445
He's going to try and kill your sister
before she reaches the country house.

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:27.972
- Why?
- Because he's not in control there.

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:31.078
Turn left.

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:37.149
Oh, great.

01:01:37.226 --> 01:01:39.854
Just shove them out of the way.

01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:42.864
They're human beings. John.
not sheep.

01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:46.231
- If you insist on splitting hairs.
- I do, actually.

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:52.030
That one looks like a sheep.

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:27.400
Oh, your homing instincts
have got an awful lot to be desired.

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:32.278
Suffice to say that a great many of my
instincts are compromised in this form.

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:36.375
So am I ever going to see you
in your real form?

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:41.786
Yes, eventually.

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:44.520
Is that a promise?

01:02:45.561 --> 01:02:48.894
Oh, yes.
That's a promise.

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:45.376
- Follow the taxi.
- What?

01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:53.059
Don't, just don't.

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:08.335
What can I do. Officer?

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:11.471
Just be a good little monkey and drive.

01:08:02.311 --> 01:08:04.302
Aah!

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:21.826
It was quite a party while it lasted.
Allison. You really should have been there.

01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:25.661
<i>The regime fell almost overnight.</i>

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:27.792
<i>No one was spared.</i>

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:29.667
Except you.

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:32.798
You survived with your soul intact.

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:35.069
Lucky, lucky you.

01:08:38.613 --> 01:08:40.548
Who are you?

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:42.243
Why am I here?

01:08:42.318 --> 01:08:46.152
Come on.
I told you all this on the day you were born.

01:08:46.221 --> 01:08:48.712
Don't you remember?

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:54.652
Sorry I'm late.
We had to stop for petrol and sweets.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.468
What a waste.

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:03.130
You know, you really could have
made more of this place.

01:09:03.205 --> 01:09:06.765
The evil that bred here.
Such an opportunity.

01:09:06.841 --> 01:09:09.037
And you let it slip away.

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:13.475
And now what have you got left?

01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:19.777
Just this poor little head case.

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:24.682
And a police officer

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:30.163
who thinks he can buy salvation with
the money he rips off from drug dealers.

01:09:30.232 --> 01:09:31.529
Really.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.591
And you wonder why I deserted you?

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:40.868
You remember the first war?
The big one.

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:44.606
We stood on those ramparts
long after we knew our cause was lost.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:49.743
Together we beat back Michael's hordes
right down to the bitter end.

01:09:49.818 --> 01:09:51.877
When you fell, I fell.

01:09:51.953 --> 01:09:55.947
When you rose up in that lake of fire.
I was right there by your side.

01:09:56.025 --> 01:10:01.588
still defiant, still proud.
opposing God at every turn.

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:03.359
I loved you.

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.891
As my master.

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:09.961
Just as you once loved yours.

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:15.844
But along the way.
the lines got blurred, didn't they?

01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:20.245
Well, there were no more rallying cries.
no more odes of vindication.

01:10:20.316 --> 01:10:22.409
No more black, no more white.

01:10:22.484 --> 01:10:26.921
Just endless, endless shades of gray.

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:32.522
What happened to you?

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:36.622
Did you get tired?
Or just bored?

01:10:40.202 --> 01:10:42.727
<i>Still, no matter. Nici problemâ.</i>

01:10:42.805 --> 01:10:48.072
I'm here to fix all that.
with a little leg up from that book.

01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:52.506
Look, I don't pretend
to love you or your kind.

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:55.379
All I'm offering you
is a way to restore the balance again.

01:10:55.451 --> 01:10:58.978
To make it like it was, when there
were saints, Allison, and true demons.

01:10:59.054 --> 01:11:03.115
and you could actually
tell one from the other.

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:06.923
I just want it all to make sense again.
nothing more.

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:11.431
And all you have to do
is give me that book.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.331
Don't.

01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:16.399
Don't do it. Lucia.

01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:18.838
What are you?
Another demon?

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:21.000
Close.

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:23.943
He's your brother.

01:11:27.016 --> 01:11:32.147
Go ahead. Touch the scar on your face.
It might help you remember.

01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:34.655
Dear beloved Dani.

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:39.126
who betrayed his own parents.
and yours, to the Securitate.

01:11:39.194 --> 01:11:44.632
and in so doing, happened to
condemn them to a rather grisly death.

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:46.527
Lucia.

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:48.433
Don't.

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:52.864
I'm so...

01:11:53.909 --> 01:11:56.400
so sorry for what I did.

01:11:57.279 --> 01:12:00.043
I'm not Lucia.

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:04.876
All I want...

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:07.922
all I've ever wanted
is to be forgiven.

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:09.981
Just that.

01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:12.892
Just to be forgiven.

01:12:16.298 --> 01:12:18.732
My name is Allison.

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:21.529
And I don't know you.

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:24.862
I've never known you.

01:12:27.776 --> 01:12:31.803
Oh, please. Don't get all dramatic on me.
Just give me the book.

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.576
That book is a weapon, Allison.

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:38.181
For reasons that you could never grasp.

01:12:38.253 --> 01:12:40.312
Do not give it up.

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:43.290
Well, let me put it another way.
Just give me the book.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:46.419
or I'll rip your heart out
and feed it to those dogs outside.

01:12:46.495 --> 01:12:48.986
He's lying.
He can't touch you.

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:51.431
How do I know that?

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:55.561
Because this house, forgive the overused
metaphor, is hell on Earth.

01:12:55.637 --> 01:13:00.597
It was ceded to me by virtue of the deeds
committed here which makes it my domain.

01:13:00.676 --> 01:13:03.236
My house.

01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:05.780
My rules.

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:09.076
What about you?

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:10.846
I don't want the book.

01:13:10.919 --> 01:13:13.547
It repulses me.

01:13:13.622 --> 01:13:17.683
- I'd much prefer you kept it.
- Oh, brilliant.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.957
You're not even going for the win now?
How pathetic.

01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:24.658
Great Satan himself.
and he's playing for the draw?

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:27.725
There's always tomorrow. Belial.

01:13:29.004 --> 01:13:31.165
Well, I hate to see you go, Allison.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.141
but if you really must, bye.

01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:39.074
Just know.
the moment you step through that door.

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:42.743
you are no longer
under my protection.

01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:45.048
The devil's protection?

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:49.784
Of course, you can always stay here.
on hell's half-acre.

01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:55.228
Look on it as an embassy where you can
always get asylum for as long as you want.

01:13:55.297 --> 01:13:56.958
Decades, eons.

01:13:57.032 --> 01:14:02.060
After all, time is of no concern
to a little angel like you, is it?

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:07.833
Just give me the book
and walk away free and clear.

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:15.812
Or face eternity here.
alone with you know who.

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:18.444
Your choice, sweetheart.

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:40.469
I thought you had this
all figured out by now, Dani.

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:45.138
You kill this vessel.
I just move straight on to the next one.

01:14:45.214 --> 01:14:47.512
And who might that be?

01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:50.643
Well, now, let me see.

01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:54.780
I suppose that would be you.

01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:58.293
Well, I pretty much thought the same thing.

01:14:59.094 --> 01:15:01.562
Only two rounds left now.

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:03.359
That's right.

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:07.198
One for you, one for me.

01:15:09.705 --> 01:15:13.106
Well, you know what they say
about suicide, my friend.

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:16.542
Go straight to hell.
Do not pass go.

01:15:16.612 --> 01:15:21.447
- Could do with a change of scenery.
- You wouldn't.

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:25.783
Oh, well, you're such
a shrewd judge of human nature.

01:15:26.788 --> 01:15:29.279
You tell me.

01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:27.505
He's still here.

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:51.098
He can't stay outside a body for long.

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:29.467
It's so easy

01:17:29.544 --> 01:17:32.513
to work with these monkeys.

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:36.745
Maybe, but they can still
bite like a son of a bitch.

01:19:11.346 --> 01:19:14.679
You never needed my forgiveness, Dani.

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:26.120
Not like I need yours now.

01:19:45.347 --> 01:19:47.338
Bye.

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:48.106
It's done.

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:49.871
For now.

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:53.246
Where is he?

01:20:53.315 --> 01:20:55.545
Belial?

01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:58.211
He's where he belongs.

01:20:58.286 --> 01:21:00.277
With me.

01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:07.818
God created the world in seven days.

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:13.198
This is the eighth.

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:17.070
Remember.

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:21.541
there are still
so many out there who despise you.

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:24.204
And your kind.

01:21:24.279 --> 01:21:26.110
Why?

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:30.207
Because of what you are.

01:21:31.186 --> 01:21:33.416
And more than that.

01:21:33.488 --> 01:21:36.150
what you might yet become.

01:21:40.328 --> 01:21:42.489
What about you?

01:21:43.498 --> 01:21:45.830
Do you despise me?

01:22:19.067 --> 01:22:21.058
Sleep well...
