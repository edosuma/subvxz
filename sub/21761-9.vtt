Hey, what are... Paws off!

00:44.085 --> 00:45.880
And watch the beverage, mister!

00:45.963 --> 00:48.298
Enough. I know exactly what to do.

00:48.382 --> 00:52.219
I hereby declare
that the baby be cut in half.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.972
Um, actually, it's a pineapple,
Your Majesty.

00:55.096 --> 00:57.265
I know, but a baby is more dramatic.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.894
Do that fun serious voice thing
you do, Mo-Mo.

00:59.977 --> 01:02.145
I love that. [chuckles] Do it.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.773
Master at Arms, carry out the sentence!

01:04.940 --> 01:06.692
-Ha-yah!
-[both laugh]

01:07.026 --> 01:07.902
Oh, boy!

01:08.402 --> 01:09.403
Wow, Your Majesty,

01:09.486 --> 01:11.655
you're really getting the hang of this
whole being king thing.

01:11.864 --> 01:13.866
[chuckles] I know, right?

01:13.949 --> 01:15.242
The peoples love me.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.202
"Oh, he's so regal and stuff."

01:17.285 --> 01:20.121
"He's completely braintastic."

01:20.288 --> 01:23.417
Yes! I love the royal brains!

01:24.585 --> 01:26.211
No, Mort. Bad Mort.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.047
Wait, do you hear that?

01:28.129 --> 01:31.675
It's just Mort being annoying
trying to love on my brains.

01:31.759 --> 01:32.801
Not that.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.929
[grunts] That!

[making karate noises]

01:47.399 --> 01:48.358
On it! Hah!

01:51.570 --> 01:55.365
Or I would be on it, Your Majesty,
if I could see them!

01:55.449 --> 01:56.450
Where are the foosa?

01:56.617 --> 01:59.578
I just heard someone
screaming about a foosa attack

01:59.661 --> 02:01.496
so naturally, I overreacted.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.749
You did the right thing, Pancho.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.417
[yelling] We're all gonna die!

The foosa got me!

02:17.596 --> 02:19.598
My leg! Where's my leg?

02:19.681 --> 02:20.975
Look behind your back.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.939
Ah! You got me!

02:27.022 --> 02:30.859
Maurice, you old mopey-mope,
you're right! [laughs]

02:30.943 --> 02:32.444
There's no foosa attack!

02:32.527 --> 02:35.864
But you guys were all,
"Ah! Foosa! Look at the foosa!"

02:36.031 --> 02:39.910
[gasps] Is that Rob McTodd?

02:39.994 --> 02:42.162
Oh, man! [laughs]

02:42.245 --> 02:44.748
He so got you guys! Burn!

02:45.791 --> 02:48.502
That is just so Rob!

02:48.669 --> 02:52.339
Everybody! This is my oldest
and bestest friend,

02:52.422 --> 02:55.926
Rob "The Party Animal" McTodd.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.678
I haven't seen him since...

02:57.761 --> 03:00.472
He was banished for nearly giving
your uncle a heart attack

03:00.555 --> 03:02.223
when Rob pranked him
on his birthday.

03:03.182 --> 03:04.810
[Rob laughing]

03:05.060 --> 03:07.186
Oh! You should have seen your faces!

03:07.354 --> 03:11.525
Speaking of faces, uh,
what happened to yours?

03:11.692 --> 03:14.402
I had a little work done. Nothing much.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.363
Just a brow lift, eye tightening,
chin tuck,

03:16.446 --> 03:18.573
nose re-nostriling,
whale blubber lip enhancement,

03:18.657 --> 03:21.910
packing peanuts in the cheeks.
Pretty st-st-st-standard.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.912
Gotta keep the age gremlins away.

03:26.123 --> 03:30.169
You mean that you did... [clears throat]
that intentionally?

03:30.335 --> 03:33.212
Clover, how dare you insult my friend!

03:33.338 --> 03:35.549
Rob's freaky new face looks fantastic!

03:35.632 --> 03:38.844
The McTodd has always been
on the cutting edge of beauty.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.721
It's so me!

03:40.888 --> 03:42.514
[laughs] Yeah.

03:42.597 --> 03:46.727
Back in the day, me and this guy
were like those crazy babies

03:46.810 --> 03:48.436
who are attached at the belly buttons--

03:48.520 --> 03:49.396
Twins.

03:49.521 --> 03:50.814
Twins aren't attached.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.525
-Uh, pretty sure they are.
-I'm a twin.

03:53.608 --> 03:56.153
My sister Crimson has never been
attached to my stomach.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.572
Pff! You don't know that.

03:58.780 --> 04:02.409
Anyway, Rob and me,
we used to get crazy!

04:02.492 --> 04:06.580
Oh, man. Oh, man, remember
our hip-hop band, L-L-T-Double-L?

04:06.747 --> 04:08.331
Lemurs Love the Lemur Ladies!

04:08.498 --> 04:12.836
Rob's been on a worldwide party tour
for, like, ever!

04:12.920 --> 04:14.213
Been too long, buddy.

04:14.295 --> 04:15.839
You said it, Julie!

04:15.923 --> 04:17.966
Slip me some fur, bro-man!

04:18.050 --> 04:19.467
[both grunting]

04:22.930 --> 04:24.305
[all groaning]

04:24.472 --> 04:26.767
[lemur] That put me
right off my beverage.

04:29.144 --> 04:33.982
Give me a b-b-b-b-bump from the rump
for old times' sake, Maurice!

04:34.066 --> 04:35.734
You're not supposed to be here.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.819
King Julien's uncle forbid--

04:37.903 --> 04:39.071
"Me to return."

04:39.154 --> 04:42.282
But Uncle King Julien is no longer king,
chunky thighs.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.992
You cool with me being here?

04:44.076 --> 04:46.828
Uh... let me think, yes!

04:46.912 --> 04:50.540
Of course! This is amazing!

04:50.624 --> 04:57.464
I hereby decree the banishment
of Rob McTodd is lifted.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.300
That's right. Lifted!
Yeah, I just did that!

05:00.508 --> 05:02.886
Why do I get the feeling
this is a bad idea?

05:02.970 --> 05:03.845
Because it is.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.350
Last night, oh, boy, did we do
some righteous damage. [laughs]

05:09.935 --> 05:12.604

five coconuts in a row.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.481
I've never seen someone so hydrated.

05:14.648 --> 05:18.610
Well, I like to let loose
a little bit now and then.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.070
[slurping]

05:20.779 --> 05:23.615
Huh? Eh... Huh?!

05:23.698 --> 05:25.408
You call that hydration?

05:25.492 --> 05:27.244
What is this? Amateur hour?

05:27.410 --> 05:29.997
And, Ted, you maniac.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.415

05:32.499 --> 05:34.459
Anything to strengthen the core!

05:39.840 --> 05:41.091

05:41.175 --> 05:43.802
Golly, I think I tore something important.

05:43.969 --> 05:47.014
Psh. I break that many bones
just rolling out of bed.

05:47.806 --> 05:50.642
Rob! Ooh, you're in for a treat, buddy.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.936
Betcha never seen something like this!

Feel that ultra bass?

It's like a volcano
exploding in your tushy parts.

06:11.246 --> 06:12.206
Kinda need my face.

06:13.372 --> 06:14.415
[laughing]

06:14.499 --> 06:16.293
Pretty impressive, right?

06:16.459 --> 06:17.752
Yeah, pretty impressive

06:17.836 --> 06:20.630
for a polka party at an old folks home!

06:20.714 --> 06:24.009
Let me hit you with some real jock jams.

[faster dance music playing]

06:25.384 --> 06:29.264
Can you dig it? Can you dig it!

06:29.472 --> 06:31.099
[all screaming excitedly]

06:31.892 --> 06:34.102
You toss in a couple of glow sticks.

06:35.062 --> 06:39.358
Add a little witch-doctor-prescribed
bone dust extract.

06:39.440 --> 06:45.197

-How'd you do it?
-I just hear things better.

07:03.715 --> 07:06.551
Had my old ears replaced
with dolphin ear drums.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.361
-Oh!
-One more! One more!

07:24.444 --> 07:26.154
-One more!
-I can't.

07:26.321 --> 07:29.532
I've already eaten
over a thousand.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.785
Those pok-pok are laughing at you, Mort.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.329
They think you're weak.
Right, Julie?

07:34.413 --> 07:35.247
Huh?

07:35.330 --> 07:37.082
Yeah, man. They're weak.

07:37.165 --> 07:41.795
And they were talking
some real smack to me earlier.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.755
I mean, it was mean stuff, man.

07:43.838 --> 07:47.759
What! No one talks smack
to my King Julien!

Check out these party tramps!

08:18.957 --> 08:20.083
What do you say, Rob?

08:20.167 --> 08:22.210
Pretty impressive
trampoline action, right?

08:22.294 --> 08:23.837
Maybe last year.

08:23.920 --> 08:27.841
If you want to see some serious
next-level tramp action, watch this.

08:37.642 --> 08:40.645
See? Light as a bird.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.566
Had all my old bones
replaced with bird bones.

08:45.733 --> 08:48.153
Completely hollow.

08:49.988 --> 08:53.867
Broseph, the lemur ladies
are totally digging on you.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.202
It's the hair.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.371
I had it all transplanted from my butt.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.913
I don't even know it's gone.

08:59.122 --> 08:59.956
Ooh!

09:01.249 --> 09:04.252
Guess the "McTodd soup"
was a little too spicy.

09:04.419 --> 09:07.630
Remember that club
we always fantasized about opening?

09:07.714 --> 09:08.756
Club Moist.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.675
Yeah! Why didn't we ever do it?

09:10.758 --> 09:13.803
We even picked out the space
in that old whale carcass.

09:13.970 --> 09:17.140
We didn't do it
because while I was banished

09:17.224 --> 09:20.601
and living our dream
of a world partying tour,

09:20.685 --> 09:22.812
you stayed here and played king.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.982
"I'm a king." Come on!

09:26.149 --> 09:26.983
Yeah.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.653
I wonder if I made the right choice
not going with you.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.073
Great thing about choices, Julie,

09:33.156 --> 09:35.534
you can always make new ones.

09:38.953 --> 09:42.290
King Julien? King J-- Maurice?
What are you doing?

09:42.457 --> 09:44.543
Someone has to keep the kingdom going.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.128
So you're aware of what's happening?

09:47.212 --> 09:48.629
Let me guess, a party!

09:48.796 --> 09:49.797
Of course I am.

09:49.881 --> 09:53.510
Rob McTodd shows up
and King Julien reverts to his old self.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.720
That's so Rob!

09:55.887 --> 09:58.306
You really don't like this bloke, do ya?

09:58.390 --> 10:00.016
Something happen between you two?

10:00.183 --> 10:01.226
Oh, yeah.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.228
Something definitely happened.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.647
My job was to watch over Prince Julien

10:06.731 --> 10:09.150
but Rob wanted the Prince all to himself,

10:09.234 --> 10:11.278
so he found a way to get rid of me.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.738
He called them practical jokes.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.532
Oh! Look at the pretty box.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.617
[screams] My eye!

10:17.742 --> 10:19.411
[laughing loudly]

10:19.578 --> 10:21.413
Whew. I sure am thirsty.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.124
[screams] My other eye!

10:24.207 --> 10:26.293
[laughing loudly]

10:26.376 --> 10:27.877
Look at you!

10:28.253 --> 10:31.005
Mmm. Time for a good nap.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.173

10:32.340 --> 10:33.592
Both my eyes!

10:34.551 --> 10:37.095
Oh, my! Oh, my, look at that!

10:37.178 --> 10:38.179
[laughing loudly]

10:38.388 --> 10:42.683
By the time the swelling went down
and pus stopped oozing from my eyes,

10:42.767 --> 10:45.228
Prince Julien and Rob were inseparable.

10:45.312 --> 10:50.400
Maurice, I am so sorry, but come on,
you fell for that three times?

10:50.567 --> 10:51.526
Not the point, Clover!

10:51.610 --> 10:53.861
Rob wanted Prince Julien
all to himself

10:53.945 --> 10:55.238
because without Julien,

10:55.322 --> 10:57.073
he was just plain old Rob McTodd.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.074
A nobody.

10:58.158 --> 11:01.620
Now he's back, it feels like
it's happening all over again.

11:01.702 --> 11:04.581
Clover, Maurice!
Oh, thank the gods, I found you.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.915
We have a big problem!

11:06.541 --> 11:08.376
[all groaning]

11:09.210 --> 11:12.547
Got to keep the party going.

11:12.631 --> 11:14.007
It's party exhaustion!

11:14.090 --> 11:16.092
Get him started on a mango drip, stat!

11:20.263 --> 11:22.182
I count 15 lemurs down.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.642
We have to do something!

11:23.724 --> 11:25.435
Keep it together, Maurice!

11:25.519 --> 11:26.894
Get me some shock paddles!

11:26.978 --> 11:28.563
Stat! And find King Julien!

11:31.774 --> 11:35.529
Why have you dragged me
out of bed at this hour, Maurice?

11:35.694 --> 11:37.405
It's 3:00 in the afternoon!

11:39.157 --> 11:41.451
Is this brunch?
It does not look like brunch.

11:41.618 --> 11:45.246
These are your people, King Julien.
Nearly dead from partying too hard.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.041
Ted?

11:48.208 --> 11:50.627
Gotta keep dancing.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.379
-Willie?
-We're all gonna die!

11:53.754 --> 11:55.048
Little Todd?

11:55.215 --> 11:56.341
But you're a child.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.677
Everyone was doing it.

11:58.759 --> 12:02.805
I just want to be like
one of the big kids,

12:02.889 --> 12:04.683
like you.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.601
[gasps and groans]

12:07.352 --> 12:11.939
I was just dropping my booty
to the floor with Todd last night. How?

12:12.106 --> 12:13.358
It's Rob McTodd.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.276
He's evil, Your Majesty.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.194
Evil!

12:16.361 --> 12:19.780
You have to banish him again.
For the sake of the kingdom.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.492
But I just un-banished him.

12:22.576 --> 12:26.745
He was going to teach me something
called twerking. [whimpers]

12:26.913 --> 12:27.997
Oh.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.875
How many more, King Julien?

12:30.958 --> 12:32.168
Where does it end?

12:32.252 --> 12:34.295
Okay! All right! I'll do it!

12:34.379 --> 12:37.340
I will re-banish Rob McTodd!

12:39.551 --> 12:41.219
Hey, Julie, come on in.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.263
Uh... look, Rob,

12:43.346 --> 12:45.890
there's no easy way to say this but...

12:46.391 --> 12:47.308
You're leaving?

12:47.392 --> 12:48.851
Oh! What a relief!

12:48.935 --> 12:51.979
I mean, no... you... no!

12:52.146 --> 12:56.067
It's okay. I know you're here
to banish me again. Word gets around.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.902
Let me guess, Maurice?

12:58.069 --> 12:59.153
He's not a fan.

12:59.237 --> 13:00.196
I'm sorry, Rob.

13:00.363 --> 13:01.197
Me, too.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.199
Totally gonna blow the surprise.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.618
Surprise?

13:04.701 --> 13:06.453
What surprise?

13:06.536 --> 13:08.913
I'm opening our dream club.

13:09.080 --> 13:09.997
Our... [gasps]

13:10.081 --> 13:11.124
Club Moist!

13:11.332 --> 13:14.001
That's why I came back.
To surprise you.

13:14.168 --> 13:15.629
Well, it worked!

13:15.794 --> 13:17.213
When can I see it? When?

13:17.297 --> 13:18.632
When can I see it? When?

13:18.715 --> 13:19.924
When can I see it? When?

13:20.007 --> 13:22.176
Now? Can I see it now?
I'd like to see it now.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.844
Never now.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.931
Maurice would never let you go.

13:27.014 --> 13:30.977
"He's in charge of me.
Oh, I can't. Oh, I wanna go

13:31.060 --> 13:32.771
but Maurice won't let me!"

13:32.937 --> 13:34.897
Maurice is not the king of me.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.484
I am the king of me!

13:37.816 --> 13:39.152
[laughs]

13:39.235 --> 13:41.613
Lead the way, bro-meister.

13:41.696 --> 13:44.240
You got it, bro-man.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.081
Your Majesty? Your Majesty?

13:52.248 --> 13:53.207
King Julien?

13:55.502 --> 13:57.253
Hey, where is my beverage?

13:58.045 --> 13:59.922
King Julien's not here, Maurice.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.216
Coming in hot!
Coming in hot!

14:04.469 --> 14:05.386
[grunts]

14:05.470 --> 14:07.138
Oh! Was there a party?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.182
Why didn't anyone invite me?

14:09.265 --> 14:10.391
Sprang Break!

14:10.475 --> 14:12.560
Sprang Break!

14:13.227 --> 14:14.646
It wasn't Sprang Break, Xixi!

14:14.729 --> 14:18.107
It was just King Julien's old friend,
Rob McTodd visiting.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.943
Rob "The Party Animal" McTodd was here?

14:21.027 --> 14:23.904
-But he hates King Julien.
-What are you talking about?

14:24.071 --> 14:28.159
You probably can't tell, but I was a bit
of a club kid back in the day.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.536
When Rob was banished,

14:29.619 --> 14:32.163
he no longer had Julien to get into clubs.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.040
Rob was out of control,

14:34.123 --> 14:36.209
pushing the partying as far as he could

14:36.292 --> 14:38.085
to get back on top of the scene.

14:38.169 --> 14:39.879
Animals got hurt.

14:39.962 --> 14:42.048
Lot of my friends didn't make it.

14:42.131 --> 14:45.259
It was a real wake-up call
for me to stop partying.

14:45.426 --> 14:48.137
But you still party all the time so--

14:48.304 --> 14:52.350
I said it was a "wake-up call"!
I didn't say I answered it!

14:52.433 --> 14:56.312
Anyway, last I heard,
Rob escaped police custody

14:56.396 --> 14:59.148
and is missing, presumed still dancing.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.275
And he blamed his downfall on King Julien?

15:01.442 --> 15:04.195
Said he'd get even someday
if it was the last thing he did.

15:04.945 --> 15:06.865
Come on, Julie. Keep up.

15:06.947 --> 15:09.450
[sighs] Rob, I just want to say thanks

15:09.534 --> 15:12.620
for giving me this second chance
to live our dream.

15:12.787 --> 15:14.622
Don't thank me yet, handsome.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.290
[both grunting]

15:16.916 --> 15:18.084
[thunderclap]

15:19.460 --> 15:22.547
Where do we start?
Rob and the King could be anywhere!

15:22.714 --> 15:24.841
-We have to track him.
-I got this.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.844
Oh, Mort? Mort, where are you?

15:27.927 --> 15:30.179
King Julien needs you!

15:30.263 --> 15:31.264
Me?

15:35.268 --> 15:36.185
[groans]

15:36.811 --> 15:38.605
I am here, my king! Wait!

15:38.772 --> 15:41.357
[whimpering, muttering]

15:41.441 --> 15:42.692
Where is King Julien?

15:42.859 --> 15:44.527
He's missing. With Rob.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.028
And he might be in danger.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.488
Can you track him?

15:47.572 --> 15:51.492
I've been keeping his toenail clippings
in case of an event like this.

15:54.412 --> 15:55.914
Oh, yes.

15:55.996 --> 15:59.333
Mm! So powerful.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.711
[inhales deeply] Aged to perfection!

16:01.878 --> 16:03.713
[both gasp]

16:03.797 --> 16:06.674
That is happening right in front of us.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.513
I have the scent. Let's go.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.099
[howling like a wolf]

16:16.976 --> 16:22.565
Rob, I hate to be critical,
but, uh... Club Moist is a dump.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.525
And creepy. It's a creepy dump.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.319
Oh, this isn't the club.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.237
I needed to make a stop first.

16:28.321 --> 16:33.910
Doc? It's Rob McTodd.
I'm here for my appointment.

16:35.829 --> 16:36.996
Your doctor is a snake?

16:37.079 --> 16:38.289
[laughs]

16:38.372 --> 16:39.666
That is so Rob!

16:39.833 --> 16:44.671
Technically, you require a medical license
to call yourself a doctor,

16:44.754 --> 16:48.090
but the medical society
overlooked one thing.

16:48.174 --> 16:54.138
You don't need a license
when you operate out of a cave!

16:54.681 --> 16:55.765
[thunderclap]

16:56.432 --> 16:59.310
Doc, this is the good friend we discussed.
King Julien.

17:00.019 --> 17:04.398
Hm. Lustrous fur, good eyelids.

17:04.482 --> 17:09.111
Yes, you were right.
He'll make an excellent donor.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.281
It's true.
I do have pretty luxurious eyelids.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.034
Wait, did scary snake doctor
just say "donor"?

17:15.201 --> 17:16.953
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.331
My face is kind of wanted
throughout Madagascar, so--

17:20.414 --> 17:22.834
We're going to be taking yours.

17:24.168 --> 17:26.420
I'm not a medical professional,

17:26.504 --> 17:28.548
but I'm sure you need my consent

17:28.631 --> 17:30.257
before removing my face!

17:30.341 --> 17:35.889
You don't need consent
when you operate out of a cave!

17:36.055 --> 17:37.139
[screams]

17:46.774 --> 17:49.151
[Doc] Okay, Mr. King Julien,

17:49.235 --> 17:51.612
please try to stay still.

17:52.321 --> 17:56.784
This first incision
might sting just a little.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.536
[screaming]

18:02.415 --> 18:06.961
Rob McTodd, please!
This is so not Rob.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.880
Why are you doing this?

18:09.047 --> 18:13.133
Why? When your Uncle banished me,
it was finally our chance to go!

18:13.217 --> 18:17.096
The world partying tour!
Club Moist! Our dream!

18:17.179 --> 18:18.598
And you bailed!

18:18.681 --> 18:21.601
Without Prince Julien,
every club shut its doors on me.

18:21.684 --> 18:23.102
I was a nobody.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.063
I never knew, Rob.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.690
But looking back...

18:27.774 --> 18:28.816
Uh, wow!

18:28.900 --> 18:31.069
Did I make the right decision not to go!

18:31.235 --> 18:33.654
I've hated you for a long time.

18:33.738 --> 18:36.156
Still, this wasn't an easy decision
for me, Julie.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.743
You don't look
too sad about it, Rob.

18:38.910 --> 18:40.244
Don't pay attention to that.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.371
I've had so much
hyena gland put in my face

18:42.455 --> 18:44.665
that crying or frowning is impossible.

18:45.708 --> 18:49.253
[dramatically] Start the operation, Doc.
I'm ready!

18:50.797 --> 18:55.259
Now, this won't hurt a bit,
Mr. King Julien.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.344
It'll hurt a lot

18:57.428 --> 19:02.600
because we're doing surgery
out of a cave!

19:07.647 --> 19:08.522
[Mort barking]

19:09.649 --> 19:10.984
-In here!
-King Julien!

19:11.943 --> 19:13.069
[growls]

19:13.152 --> 19:14.445
Rob McTodd!

19:14.528 --> 19:17.281
What have you done to my King Julien?

19:17.448 --> 19:18.532
[yelling]

19:18.741 --> 19:21.077
No! Not the hair, it cost me a fortune!

19:21.160 --> 19:23.746
And the brow lift! You're stretching the--

19:23.830 --> 19:25.999
Stop right there, you!

19:26.082 --> 19:30.044
This would be a lot easier if I had hands!

19:31.045 --> 19:33.923
[grunting]

19:39.637 --> 19:40.471
Hiss!

19:41.180 --> 19:43.057
Don't worry, I'll get you out of this.

19:43.223 --> 19:45.434
Rabbit goes under the tree,

19:45.518 --> 19:47.227
and into the teepee.

19:47.394 --> 19:51.607
Oh, Maurice, I thought
I could still be the old me.

19:51.691 --> 19:52.984
The totally handsome,

19:53.067 --> 19:56.737
double jointed sexy pants
party god of my youth.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.783
But I'm not that me anymore.
That me is dead.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.536
Believe it or not, Your Majesty,
that's a good thing.

20:03.619 --> 20:04.495
[rumbling]

20:07.790 --> 20:08.708
[grunting]

20:12.336 --> 20:16.757
[slow-motion groaning]

20:19.468 --> 20:20.845
-[gasping]
-Hee-yah!

20:23.890 --> 20:25.058
Look out!

20:27.852 --> 20:29.353
[panting]

20:29.520 --> 20:31.772
And this is why I hate doctors.

20:31.856 --> 20:32.940
[screaming]

20:33.066 --> 20:34.984
Nobody messes
with my King Julien!

20:35.068 --> 20:35.902
Nobody!

20:36.110 --> 20:36.986
Stop, Mort!

20:37.070 --> 20:39.072
It's okay! I'm safe!

20:40.531 --> 20:42.033
Hi, King Julien!

20:42.116 --> 20:43.242
[giggles]

20:44.243 --> 20:45.745
[mumbling unintelligibly]

20:48.497 --> 20:49.331
[all gasp]

20:49.415 --> 20:52.710
Oh, blimey rhymey, that's not pretty.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.212
Rob. Uh...

20:54.294 --> 20:55.755
Whoa, buddy.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.423
[chuckles] Woof.

20:57.548 --> 21:01.177
Years of plastic surgery ruined!

21:01.260 --> 21:04.847
Everything has fallen back
to where it belongs.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.307
I... I look my age!

21:07.474 --> 21:09.143
Actually, probably a little older.

21:09.227 --> 21:11.854
Like a lot. When I say little,
I mean a lot.

21:11.938 --> 21:12.897
Like, whoa!

21:13.147 --> 21:16.067
[screaming] No!

21:17.026 --> 21:19.737
I was so pretty!

21:19.820 --> 21:22.156
I was everything to me!

21:22.240 --> 21:23.074
Ow!

21:23.157 --> 21:25.618
I stubbed my toe!

21:26.119 --> 21:28.204
[sobbing]

21:28.621 --> 21:30.330
I'm still running now!

21:30.414 --> 21:32.166
-[thump]
-Oh, it's a dead end!

21:33.375 --> 21:34.794
No, Clover, leave him alone.

21:34.877 --> 21:38.005
Whoever that is,
that's not my friend.

21:38.089 --> 21:42.342
Sadly, I lost my friend, Rob,
a long time ago.

21:43.469 --> 21:45.345
So, who's up for a funeral? Huh?
