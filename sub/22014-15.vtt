WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:04.405
Oh, my poor baby.

00:04.438 --> 00:06.474
You can't sleep,
you haven't eaten for a week.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.709
Do you want some lunch?
I made my chicken soup.

00:08.742 --> 00:11.379
Ever since Taylor left,
food has no taste.

00:11.412 --> 00:14.048
All the more reason to eat
your mom's cooking. Am I right?

00:14.082 --> 00:15.816
Fine, hit me,
but add salt!

00:15.849 --> 00:17.085
Ray!
This will cheer you up.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.220
Taylor texted to say
she's coming by in two minutes

00:19.253 --> 00:20.488
to pick up
her sweatshirt.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.856
Oh, God, she can't
see me like this!

00:22.890 --> 00:24.358
So that did not
cheer you up.

00:24.392 --> 00:25.659
Huh.
Live and learn.

00:25.693 --> 00:28.196
I got to go
take a shower.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.663
I'm too weak.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.565
That's why
you gotta eat the soup.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.934
I got to hurry up.

00:33.967 --> 00:38.506
"If only this family had
experience showering somebody."

00:38.539 --> 00:39.840
Oh, he's right!

00:39.873 --> 00:42.576
Okay, well, today, it's Ray
whose needs are special.

00:42.610 --> 00:43.844
Let's do this.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.414
**

00:46.447 --> 00:47.948
Come on, guys!
Let's go.

00:47.981 --> 00:50.184
**

00:50.218 --> 00:51.352
Come on.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.456
Clothes!

00:57.991 --> 00:59.593
Why do we even
have this?!

00:59.627 --> 01:05.032
**

01:05.065 --> 01:06.534
Yeah, now he looks better,
doesn't he?

01:06.567 --> 01:08.236
Yeah. Still a bit pale,
though.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.737
I understand the blush,

01:09.770 --> 01:11.539
but does he really need
eye shadow and lipstick?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.207
Yeah,
you're probably right.

01:13.241 --> 01:16.977
**

01:20.681 --> 01:22.216
Shampoo suds!

01:22.250 --> 01:24.118
Uh...

01:27.087 --> 01:28.556
Hi, Ray.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.823
You look good.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.559
Good game.
Yeah, good game.
Nice work out there.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.661
Left it all out on the field.
Really nice. Really nice.
Yeah. Got it.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.666
**

01:38.699 --> 01:40.768
So, things are good?
So good.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.836
I'm living
la dolce vida.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.238
Life is, um...

01:44.272 --> 01:45.606
I'm just gonna say it --

01:45.639 --> 01:47.575
a  blast.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.910
Well, I'm really glad
to hear that.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.979
So, I'm here
for my sweatshirt.

01:52.012 --> 01:53.247
You sure you don't
want to stay?

01:53.281 --> 01:54.748
I just...

01:54.782 --> 01:55.983
caught a marlin.

01:56.016 --> 01:58.419
Was gonna toss it on the grill,
little lemon...

01:58.452 --> 02:00.188
Uh, I'm good.
Thanks, though.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.589
Nice seeing you.

02:01.622 --> 02:08.862
**

02:08.896 --> 02:10.431
So, that went smoothly,
I'd say.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.432
That was awful!

02:11.465 --> 02:14.335
She was so distant,
so unfeeling.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.836
What about our love,
Taylor?

02:15.869 --> 02:19.273
Did it just wash away,
like a dream made of sand?

02:19.307 --> 02:21.175
Oh. That's good.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.143
It's going
straight in my song.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.381
Who put mascara on me?

02:27.415 --> 02:30.451
**

02:35.656 --> 02:37.325
Wonderful work, Aaron.
Come on up.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.227
Okay, who can give me
some examples

02:39.260 --> 02:43.964
of non-linear storytelling
that Aaron's film recalls?

02:43.997 --> 02:44.732
Yes, JJ.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.700
T-A-R -- "Tarantino.

02:46.734 --> 02:49.203
Early Christopher N-O...
Nolan."

02:49.237 --> 02:51.805
I just watched "Memento"
last week!

02:51.839 --> 02:53.407
I-I also obviously borrowed
from Kurosawa,

02:53.441 --> 02:54.675
with the changes
of perspective.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.077
Well, then we change to
my perspective.

02:58.946 --> 03:01.148
Kenneth, we all listened
when you talked about

03:01.181 --> 03:03.851
"B.J. and the Bear"
for 30 minutes.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.887
"I also thought
it was funny."

03:06.920 --> 03:08.489
Funny, like I'm a clown?

03:08.522 --> 03:10.491
I amuse you?

03:10.524 --> 03:14.662
"No, Tommy, how you tell the
story and E-V -- everything."

03:14.695 --> 03:16.230
Yes, we've all seen
"Goodfellas."

03:16.264 --> 03:17.698
Like I'm here
to make you laugh?

03:17.731 --> 03:19.667
Like I'm here
to blankin' amuse you?

03:19.700 --> 03:22.336
I appreciate the not swearing,
Aaron, but it is a long scene.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.671
You're not gonna do
the whole thing, are you?

03:23.704 --> 03:27.207
"Just, you know,
how you tell the story. What?"

03:27.241 --> 03:29.410
Ring! Oh! What do you know?
Class is over.

03:29.443 --> 03:30.878
No, no.
I don't know. You said it.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.713
How would I know?
You said I'm funny.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.548
Guys, that's
the actual bell.

03:34.582 --> 03:37.017
Teacher
says, "Every time a bell rings,

03:37.050 --> 03:38.786
an angel
gets its wings."

03:38.819 --> 03:40.954
"'It's a W-O --
Wonderful Life.'"

03:41.922 --> 03:43.357
Not for me, it ain't.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.793
**

03:45.826 --> 03:47.761
Hey, did someone
change the light bulb?

03:47.795 --> 03:50.531
Maya, we're supposed
to talk about large purchases.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.065
Oh, I had
Kenneth do it.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.701
It turns out
he's really handy.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.636
I don't know
how I feel about that.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.438
I might be more threatened
than lazy.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.206
Oh, my God.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.908
Ray's expressing himself
through song.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.411
* You're
the unforgettable pain *

04:03.444 --> 04:07.147
* You're the sweetest
kind of rain *

04:07.180 --> 04:09.883
* And my brain goes insane

04:09.917 --> 04:13.387
* When the Taylor train rolls
through my mainframe *

04:13.421 --> 04:15.255
The only thing
making this agony bearable

04:15.289 --> 04:16.724
is the art
flowing out of me.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.891
Darling,
it's been a week.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.427
All you do is
write songs about her

04:19.460 --> 04:21.462
and stare at her phot--

04:21.495 --> 04:25.065
Ray! You were supposed
to take this to Locks of Love.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.601
You got to forget about her.
Move on, darling.

04:27.635 --> 04:30.471
* And my mom wants me
to move on *

04:30.504 --> 04:32.906
* She says my baby
and her hair is gone *

04:32.940 --> 04:35.108
Do not put me in a line
with the hair.

04:35.142 --> 04:37.578
It could be quite cute
for parties, though.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.580
Dylan: Hey, Ray,
can I borrow your guitar?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.114
Thanks!

04:41.148 --> 04:43.083
No matter what
Ray's guitar tells you,

04:43.116 --> 04:44.818
I was acting
in self-defense.

04:44.852 --> 04:47.455
JJ, your new film buddy,
Aaron, texted.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.623
He's asking if you want to go
to the new Seth Rogen movie

04:49.657 --> 04:50.624
on Saturday.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.526
He thinks it might
"amuse you."

04:52.560 --> 04:53.927
What, like I'm a clown?

04:53.961 --> 04:55.095
No!

04:55.128 --> 04:57.164
"Tell him I can't go."

04:57.197 --> 04:58.599
Why not?

04:58.632 --> 05:03.504
"One-on-one
friend outings aren't my thing."

05:03.537 --> 05:05.005
It's easier in the house
or at school,

05:05.038 --> 05:06.840
but going out into the world
with a new friend

05:06.874 --> 05:08.609
makes for some anxiety
for JJ.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.844
"I become less a friend

05:10.878 --> 05:13.847
and more
someone to take care of."

05:13.881 --> 05:15.816
So he'll deal.
You're worth it.

05:15.849 --> 05:19.853
"They never stick around
long enough to find out.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.656
Something always goes
W-R -- wrong.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.458
It's all fun and games

05:24.492 --> 05:29.463
until there's dog poop
on the wheelchair tire."

05:29.497 --> 05:31.298
Is that, like, a saying?

05:31.331 --> 05:32.400
"I wish."

05:32.433 --> 05:34.568
Well, maybe one of us
could go with you.

05:34.602 --> 05:37.170
"An adult there?
That's not cool."

05:37.204 --> 05:38.906
You've seen this kid.
How cool do you have to be?

05:38.939 --> 05:41.241
What if you don't go
with an adult? I'll come.

05:41.274 --> 05:43.210
I'm the master of making
things look easy.

05:43.243 --> 05:45.979
I had a lisp until 5th grade,
but no one ever noticed

05:46.013 --> 05:47.815
because I just pronounced
my S's correctly

05:47.848 --> 05:49.316
when I said stuff
out loud.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.685
Kind of sounds like
you didn't have a lisp.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.222
We can get there early and make
sure our bases are covered.

05:55.255 --> 05:56.390
I can do this.

05:57.691 --> 05:58.692
Well...

05:58.726 --> 06:01.361
* You're
the unforgettable pain *

06:01.395 --> 06:03.731
What is that from?
It's so good.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.670
**

06:09.703 --> 06:10.671
Good morning.

06:10.704 --> 06:11.672
I disagree.

06:11.705 --> 06:12.906
You've been in the house
forever.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.875
Let's go out,
just the two of us,
and have some fun.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.209
Leave me alone.

06:16.243 --> 06:18.211
Darling, I know this is the
first time you've been dumped --

06:18.245 --> 06:20.047
sorry, "broken up with" --
but it's the first time

06:20.080 --> 06:22.115
I've had to deal with
a child who's been dumped.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.452
Sorry, it just rolls
off the tongue so much
easier than "dumped" --

06:24.485 --> 06:25.853
I mean,
"broken up with."

06:25.886 --> 06:27.020
Come on. Mummy will
get you through it.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.689
Let's go out together.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.924
Don't wallow.
DiMeos don't wallow.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.059
Were you
looking for this?

06:32.092 --> 06:33.427
You took my wallow box!

06:33.461 --> 06:35.295
And you'll never see it again
unless you come out with me.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.766
Taylor's empty juice boxes?

06:38.799 --> 06:40.200
That is really weird.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.369
Well-played, Mom.
Well-played.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.871
Gimme!
Jimmy, start the car!

06:43.904 --> 06:46.206
**

06:46.239 --> 06:47.240
Don't worry, JJ.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.776
I'll make sure
everything's lined up

06:48.809 --> 06:50.711
for the smoothest
day out ever.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.713
Hi. I'd like to file
a complaint.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.881
You just got here.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.116
Doesn't matter.
This ain't our first rodeo.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.051
Let me guess -- the handicapped
stall's out of order,

06:58.085 --> 06:59.419
the wheelchair seating's
been sold

06:59.453 --> 07:00.621
to people
without wheelchairs,

07:00.654 --> 07:01.955
the lift's filled up
with boxes,

07:01.989 --> 07:04.157
and your staff is
patronizing and unhelpful.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.993
Yeah, that's all true.
Okay, let's fix it.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.795
Also, there aren't enough
Chris Tucker movies.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.730
Are you the one
I talk to about that?

07:09.763 --> 07:11.599
Hi. Oh, hello!

07:11.632 --> 07:14.301
Another successful Saturday
at the dog park.

07:14.334 --> 07:16.069
I got three numbers.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.505
Pepper sealed the deal.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.339
He's fixed, right?
I dunno.

07:19.372 --> 07:20.741
He's smart, too.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.610
One morning with me, and
he's learned all these tricks.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.344
Pepper. Dance.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.515
Whoa!

07:27.548 --> 07:29.216
I want to try.
Pepper, dance!

07:30.183 --> 07:31.018
Dance, boy.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.421
Every Pepper dance now.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.789
Pepper,
make me feel worthless.

07:35.823 --> 07:36.790
Good boy!

07:36.824 --> 07:38.258
You stole my dog.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.259
What do you mean?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.961
You took him,
like you take everything.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.096
You're training my dog,
fixing my stuff.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.998
Go get your own
mediocre life!

07:45.032 --> 07:47.768
Whoa! What happened to
easygoing, lazy Jimmy?

07:47.801 --> 07:49.369
Something,
and he doesn't like it.

07:49.402 --> 07:50.838
I see
what's happening here.

07:50.871 --> 07:54.942
You are finally eating the dust
of my natural alpha-ness.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.010
But we're gonna fix this.

07:57.044 --> 08:00.313
You are gonna be the alpha,
starting with that dog.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.615
Ready to be
the alpha, Jimmy?

08:01.649 --> 08:02.716
I'm not sure.

08:02.750 --> 08:03.784
More confident!

08:03.817 --> 08:04.852
I'm not sure!

08:06.554 --> 08:08.722
All clear.
Won't be any surprises.

08:09.857 --> 08:12.526
"Thanks.
I feel good about this."

08:12.560 --> 08:14.294
Dude. JJ.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.729
A girl.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.731
I just found out that they're
showing "Goodfellas"

08:17.765 --> 08:19.533
in 35-millimeter
over at the Grand.

08:19.567 --> 08:20.701
It's 10 blocks away.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.971
I'm JJ's sister -- Dylan.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.573
JJ really likes
this theater.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.307
Maybe we stay here.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.777
Uh, we can watch
a movie here anytime.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.245
Come on.
What do you say?

08:33.280 --> 08:34.247
"Let's do it."

08:34.281 --> 08:35.883
Let's hit the road.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.017
Roads?

08:37.050 --> 08:39.720
Where we're going,
we don't need roads.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.655
Wait, Doc, are you telling me

08:41.689 --> 08:44.357
you built a time machine
out of a DeLorean?

08:45.926 --> 08:48.361
And we're sure
this guy's worth it?

08:48.395 --> 08:49.597
Maya:
Ray, check me out!

08:49.630 --> 08:50.864
Look, I'm a mum
of the future.

08:50.898 --> 08:54.201
I'm tall, I'm fast,
I'm getting a massage.

08:54.234 --> 08:57.104
Oi! You, go to your room,
or I'll zap you there.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.073
That's a digital
meat thermometer.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.341
No one's saying it isn't.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.877
Oh, come on, darling.
This is your favorite store.

09:03.911 --> 09:06.346
There's got to be something here
to make you happy.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.282
What about this drone?

09:09.316 --> 09:11.952
Wait, really?
You'd buy that for me?

09:11.985 --> 09:14.121
Well, I'd let you have it
for a few days, then return it.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.289
I mean, retail therapy,
DiMeo style.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.524
Haven't you always
wanted one?

09:17.557 --> 09:19.960
I supposed I have
droned on about it.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.895
A terrible pun!

09:21.929 --> 09:24.197
Oh, poof!
The old Ray is back.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.265
Right. Where to next?

09:25.298 --> 09:27.801
What's another activity
that you love?

09:27.835 --> 09:29.569
Ooh, let's ask that guy
in glasses.

09:29.603 --> 09:30.704
Excuse me, nerd?

09:30.738 --> 09:33.373
How about we cruise over
to the Woodside Mall?

09:33.406 --> 09:35.876
What, the fancy one across town
with all the soap stores?

09:35.909 --> 09:37.277
Oof. Your day.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.578
Is this a bitcoin?

09:40.580 --> 09:43.583
"So, are we walking
to the theater, or..."

09:43.617 --> 09:45.686
L-Let's just take a car.
It's on me.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.222
See? There's tons of cars
in the area.

09:49.256 --> 09:52.392
Okay. Cool. Just make sure
it's an accessible car.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.593
Here, just press
this button.

09:55.028 --> 09:55.996
Whoa!

09:56.029 --> 09:58.231
W-What a weird thing
to happen.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.333
Usually, when you hit
the "disability" button,

10:00.367 --> 10:01.902
more cars pop up.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.003
Let's just walk.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.472
Sorry, guys.

10:05.505 --> 10:09.242
I know JJ doesn't want
his kid sister tagging along.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.911
It'll take a little longer
to get around,

10:10.944 --> 10:13.881
but rest assured,
it is all my fault.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.150
Oh, do you need...

10:17.184 --> 10:19.086
Sorry.
This is my Dumpster.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.521
I left it here.

10:24.024 --> 10:27.360
Step 1 of being an alpha --
eye contact.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.262
I always feel like
you're looking at my knees.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.764
I just relate more
to knees.

10:30.798 --> 10:31.865
Eyes up here!

10:31.899 --> 10:33.600
Good.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.102
Now, on to posture.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.604
Stand tall,
like you're in charge.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.839
Speak with authority.

10:38.872 --> 10:39.707
Okay!

10:39.740 --> 10:40.874
Yeah. Alright.
I'm liking it.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.209
Give a command.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.444
Pepper, roll over.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.014
Pepper, roll over.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.481
You don't have to do it
in slow motion.

10:48.515 --> 10:50.017
Just say "roll over."

10:51.985 --> 10:54.621
Okay, I-I think I'm still coming
across as the pack leader.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.489
New plan.

10:56.523 --> 10:57.958
Debase me.
What?

10:57.991 --> 11:00.660
Humiliate me while your dog
watches. It's the only way.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.463
The only way? Shouldn't we think
about this for, like, a minute?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.531
We're losing daylight!

11:06.333 --> 11:07.701
Ow!

11:09.737 --> 11:13.306
See? Isn't this better
than crying into your box?

11:13.340 --> 11:14.842
Now, which store
should we go to first?

11:14.875 --> 11:18.211
I was thinking I might
window-shop on my own for a bit.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.247
Aw. Maya no come

11:20.280 --> 11:21.414
That okay?
Okay.

11:21.448 --> 11:22.582
Well,
I'll meet you in an hour

11:22.615 --> 11:24.718
by the fountain
where Dylan steals change.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.990
Oh. Mom, I just wanted to say
thanks. You're the best.

11:32.860 --> 11:37.931
Wait, the drone, the wallow box,
showing me affection.

11:37.965 --> 11:41.769
What have you got
up your bony, little sleeve?

11:41.802 --> 11:44.571
We're, uh, spoiled
in California.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.506
You know, in New York,
they wouldn't even think twice

11:46.539 --> 11:48.008
about walking
eight blocks.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.878
Hey, I'm walkin' here!
I'm walkin' here!

11:51.912 --> 11:53.413
Oh, you can't get over that.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.415
That's why you're not laughing
at my "Midnight Cowboy."

11:55.448 --> 11:57.050
He can't,
but that's not why.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.187
Is it maybe easier
to go around?

12:00.220 --> 12:03.857
"It's only a few inches
off the curb.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.392
Easy-peasy."

12:07.294 --> 12:09.229
Dude! That is,
like, 5 inches.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.431
Do you have
a death wish?

12:11.464 --> 12:15.035
"If I die,
tell Ray he's a dork."

12:15.068 --> 12:16.736
You know I will, buddy.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.941
**

12:20.974 --> 12:22.910
Ray, you're a dork!

12:24.311 --> 12:26.179
Hey! You made it!

12:29.082 --> 12:31.551
"And now the part
where the R-A --

12:31.584 --> 12:34.955
rain short-circuits
my chair."

12:34.988 --> 12:35.755
Rain?

12:35.789 --> 12:37.590
Oh, boy.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.227
What are you doing?!

12:40.260 --> 12:41.895
H-Hey! "Shawshank"!

12:44.764 --> 12:47.134
Yeesh! Get a screening room,
you two.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.939
Kenneth, off!
Oh!

12:51.972 --> 12:53.406
Anything you say,
Alpha.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.779
Now you may eat.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.250
So alpha!

13:03.283 --> 13:04.952
Alright, now,
really give it to me here.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.153
Yeah.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.789
Kenneth,
get the paper now!

13:12.159 --> 13:13.293
Oh.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.527
Hi. Yeah,
this is just a --

13:14.561 --> 13:16.796
It's too hard to explain.
Just give me the package.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.299
In my mouth, dummy.

13:19.332 --> 13:24.972
**

13:31.011 --> 13:33.947
Taylor.
Ooh, you were using me.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.615
God!

13:35.648 --> 13:38.818
Ray: * You're
the unforgettable pain *

13:38.852 --> 13:42.355
* You're the sweetest
kind of rain *
Oh...no!

13:43.756 --> 13:45.525
Uh, w-why are we
waiting here?

13:45.558 --> 13:46.960
Can the wheelchair
not get wet?

13:46.994 --> 13:49.362
Oh! No,
this is all me.

13:49.396 --> 13:50.998
I like
standing under awnings.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.565
They're...

13:52.599 --> 13:54.067
romantic.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.302
Now...

13:55.335 --> 13:57.971
kiss me
under this dumb thing!

13:58.005 --> 14:00.673
U-uh, w-we should probably get
to -- t-to the movie.

14:02.275 --> 14:03.476
Yeah, you guys go.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.812
I-I'll go find
some plastic bags to cover us.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.648
I'll catch up
with you guys later!

14:08.681 --> 14:09.917
Let's go!

14:11.051 --> 14:17.925
**

14:21.694 --> 14:23.863
What happened? Oh, no!
Did it short?

14:25.132 --> 14:26.499
Let's just push it.

14:26.533 --> 14:30.003
"It's too H-E-A --
heavy to move."

14:30.037 --> 14:31.504
Let me try.

14:34.707 --> 14:38.345
My name is Inigo Montoya.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.413
You killed my wheelchair.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.920
Prepare to die!

14:50.157 --> 14:51.858
What was that?

14:51.891 --> 14:53.360
Oh! Uh...

14:53.393 --> 14:54.962
Houston,
we have a problem.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.029
Uh...

14:56.063 --> 14:57.097
"We're done.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.365
Just go."

14:58.398 --> 15:00.067
No, no. It's okay.

15:01.501 --> 15:02.635
"It's not.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.737
Go now."

15:04.771 --> 15:06.806
At least let me push you
under the awning. I --

15:07.941 --> 15:10.877
"No. Leave."

15:10.910 --> 15:15.983
**

15:16.016 --> 15:19.486
* You're the sweetest
kind of rain *

15:19.519 --> 15:21.221
* And my brain goes insane *

15:24.091 --> 15:25.592
What the heck?

15:25.625 --> 15:26.960
Mummy to Ray.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.361
Come in, Ray. Over.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.299
Mom!
What are you doing?
I'm trying to save you.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.434
This drone is gonna
embarrass you in front of Taylor

15:34.467 --> 15:35.735
and all these people,

15:35.768 --> 15:37.971
some of whom are your age
and quite cute.

15:38.005 --> 15:39.772
Excuse me.
Are you single?

15:39.806 --> 15:40.907
This is my son.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.475
Class rank -- 6.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.744
I don't want anyone else.
I want Taylor.

15:44.777 --> 15:45.845
Well, this is for
your own good.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.180
Give me back my drone!

15:47.214 --> 15:48.515
See how fast he runs,
ladies?

15:49.949 --> 15:53.286
I love you, buddy,
but this part's a drag.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.055
You're gonna have to
learn to walk.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.358
I had that guy wrong.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.293
He just rolled you in this
and left?

16:01.961 --> 16:05.132
"After I told him to go."

16:05.165 --> 16:07.034
What

16:07.067 --> 16:09.369
"He was just
putting up with me.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.271
They all get sick of it."

16:11.304 --> 16:13.273
So you did this?

16:13.306 --> 16:15.942
You know, I can move all
the Dumpsters out of your way,

16:15.975 --> 16:18.978
but I can't move you
out of your own way.

16:19.012 --> 16:21.814
It doesn't matter
if the world is accessible

16:21.848 --> 16:23.016
if you're not.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.620
"Fine.
I'll talk to him."

16:27.654 --> 16:29.122
Good for you!

16:29.156 --> 16:30.790
Go to him!

16:30.823 --> 16:33.626
Oh. Right. Yeah. I'll get him
and bring him here.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.195
That makes more sense.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.034
Mom, stop!
You can't do that!

16:41.068 --> 16:42.235
I'm trying to protect you.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.503
Taylor has moved on.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.038
You have to be strong
and move on, too.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.574
I don't want to move on.
I want her to take me back.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.008
Yeah, but we're DiMeos.
We don't beg.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.710
We pretend we never cared
in the first place

16:50.743 --> 16:52.079
and then we spread rumors
that they breastfed

16:52.112 --> 16:53.246
'til they were 21.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.847
I must not be
a DiMeo, then.

16:54.881 --> 16:57.350
You and I are the most different
people in this family --

16:57.384 --> 16:58.985
maybe in the world.
But, darling --

16:59.018 --> 17:00.920
I want to beg for Taylor,

17:00.953 --> 17:02.755
and I don't want my mom
to tell me

17:02.789 --> 17:04.724
my way is wrong
and hers is right.

17:04.757 --> 17:09.096
I want her to have my back --
because she's my mom.

17:09.129 --> 17:11.331
So you want
blind loyalty?

17:11.364 --> 17:14.267
Well, then, we have more
in common than you think.

17:14.301 --> 17:15.735
Request granted.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.604
What do you need?
My guitar.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.439
As you wish.

17:19.472 --> 17:20.907
Sit.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.109
Sit!

17:22.142 --> 17:24.444
Okay, okay.
Hail Mary.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.945
Berate me
in front of the dog.

17:25.978 --> 17:27.046
I'm not gonna
berate you.

17:27.080 --> 17:30.183
Talk lower, big boy,
and make some stuff up.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.418
I'll look ashamed.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.052
Kenneth, you're bad.

17:33.086 --> 17:36.956
You drink all our orange juice
a-and steal all our pens.

17:36.989 --> 17:37.890
You -- Oh!

17:37.924 --> 17:39.259
You use our Netflix
so much

17:39.292 --> 17:41.528
that all our suggestions
are aimed at you.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.630
I don't want to watch
"Broadchurch," Kenneth.

17:43.663 --> 17:44.964
Well, you got to give it
a chance.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.033
It gets really good
after the seventh episode.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.868
You're in my house
more than I am.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.471
You always beat me to the good
"That's what she saids."

17:51.504 --> 17:53.940
You spend all day,
every day with my son.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.976
Now if I want to find out
what kind of day he had,
I have to ask Kenneth!

17:57.009 --> 17:59.979
Forget the dog.
Give me back my kid, man.

18:01.448 --> 18:02.882
That's what this is?

18:02.915 --> 18:05.652
Jimmy, JJ's your guy --
always will be.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.488
But if you feel for a second
that I'm in the way, I'll --

18:08.521 --> 18:12.125
I'll be more sensitive to it
and back the hell off.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.493
I promise you.

18:13.526 --> 18:14.527
Thanks.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.130
Look!

18:17.164 --> 18:18.298
He sat!

18:19.666 --> 18:20.700
Hey!

18:23.170 --> 18:26.839
Aaron, JJ has something
he wants to tell you.

18:26.873 --> 18:32.279
"Look, today didn't go
exactly how I W -- wanted it."

18:32.312 --> 18:33.980
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.448
Heard it
a thousand times.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.417
Okay, you put it up with it
as long as you could,

18:37.450 --> 18:40.086
but now you're tired of me and
my constant movie references.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.088
I'm a burden,
hard to be around.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.424
Like John Candy in
"Planes, Trains & Automobiles."

18:44.457 --> 18:46.693
Oh! I'm doing it again!
Ohh!

18:46.726 --> 18:48.495
"I can't relate,

18:48.528 --> 18:51.564
but I can see
how you might have that problem.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.967
I think I owe you
another shot."

18:55.001 --> 18:55.968
Yeah?

18:56.002 --> 18:57.604
Uh...okay,
then wait right here.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.806
I think I saw something up there
that might help.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.209
I'll be back.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.210
Last one.

19:03.243 --> 19:07.113
[ "Chariots of Fire" theme
plays ]

19:07.146 --> 19:09.182
To infinity and beyond!

19:09.216 --> 19:10.350
Last one.

19:10.383 --> 19:15.555
**

19:15.588 --> 19:20.727
**

19:20.760 --> 19:22.195
We did it!

19:24.096 --> 19:28.134
Mr. Frodo,
I can't carry it for you,

19:28.167 --> 19:29.836
but I can carry you!

19:29.869 --> 19:31.538
**

19:33.440 --> 19:36.909
**

19:36.943 --> 19:38.077
Ray?

19:38.110 --> 19:42.349
Taylor, I know you must feel
so hurt and angry.

19:42.382 --> 19:45.418
I was a jerk.
I let a girl kiss me.

19:45.452 --> 19:46.686
I was wrong.

19:46.719 --> 19:49.522
You're the kindest, most gentle
person I've ever known,

19:49.556 --> 19:53.092
and if given the chance,
I swear I will do better.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.061
I hope
you can forgive me.

19:55.094 --> 19:56.929
I wrote this one
for you.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.935
When I asked for space,
you said, "Let's stay friends."

20:02.969 --> 20:04.604
I asked, "Are you sure
you'll be okay with that?"

20:04.637 --> 20:05.938
You said,
"Sure I'll be okay."

20:05.972 --> 20:09.442
Coming to my work and causing
a scene is not "okay."

20:09.476 --> 20:11.544
Not trusting me
is not "okay."

20:11.578 --> 20:14.914
Kissing another girl --
definitely not "okay."

20:14.947 --> 20:17.116
Your meddling mom --
not okay.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.751
I like it.
Yes, I'll take th--

20:18.785 --> 20:19.786
Taylor!

20:19.819 --> 20:21.354
Ha! Goodness.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.456
Ray!
Hey, dude!

20:23.490 --> 20:25.124
Okay, well --
I'm not done.

20:25.157 --> 20:27.727
Keeping my hair --
so not okay.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.429
Well, I got you
this flower --

20:29.462 --> 20:31.364
Yeah, no, I don't like that tree
at all, actually.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.799
We're gonna
take our business elsewhere.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.467
Sorry.
Thank you so much.

20:34.501 --> 20:38.405
God, I've never seen sweet,
gentle Taylor so mad before.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.773
I know. It was great!
How do you figure?

20:40.807 --> 20:43.710
I wanted to see some emotion
from her, and I did.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.446
She still feels something.
I've got a chance.

20:46.479 --> 20:49.649
So my agreeing to let you
do it your way worked.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.050
Mom...

20:51.083 --> 20:52.619
she hates me!

20:52.652 --> 20:54.153
Yay!

20:59.359 --> 21:00.560
These are great credits.

21:07.367 --> 21:11.170
"Sorry we missed
the movie."

21:11.203 --> 21:12.271
Are you kidding?

21:12.305 --> 21:14.173
I feel like
I was just in a movie.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.008
That was crazy fun.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.644
What are we doing
next weekend?

21:18.678 --> 21:21.814
"I think this is
the B-E --

21:21.848 --> 21:24.183
beginning of a...

21:24.216 --> 21:25.718
beautiful friendship."

21:33.292 --> 21:35.294
