00:00.024 --> 00:01.565
Previously on "Devious Maids"...

00:01.616 --> 00:03.097
Peter. Husband number three.

00:03.147 --> 00:04.785
Please stop dating Peter.

00:04.835 --> 00:06.342
I'm not breaking up with him.

00:06.392 --> 00:07.555
A little birdie told me

00:07.605 --> 00:10.071
that Marisol got
back together with Jesse.

00:10.121 --> 00:12.512
I am with Peter now.
You have to accept that.

00:12.562 --> 00:15.473
You were right.
Marisol's seeing her ex again.

00:16.369 --> 00:17.762
I know you're my mother now.

00:17.812 --> 00:19.417
I'm not your mother, Danni.

00:19.467 --> 00:20.978
I gave you up for a reason.

00:21.028 --> 00:23.017
From now on, you're nothing to me.

00:23.067 --> 00:24.135
I'm leaving you.

00:24.185 --> 00:25.910
Evelyn, we were meant to be together.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.386
Oh, you're the reverend. Hello.

00:27.436 --> 00:30.599
I was afraid you might be
a bit of a... goody-goody.

00:30.649 --> 00:31.541
I'm no saint.

00:31.591 --> 00:32.729
My wife believes he's the greatest man

00:32.780 --> 00:33.709
that ever walked the Earth.

00:33.759 --> 00:34.804
I intend to prove her wrong.

00:34.854 --> 00:38.012
There's no reason to deny
the deep sexual tension

00:38.062 --> 00:39.061
between us.

00:39.111 --> 00:41.444
Is it possible you're unclear on
the meaning of sexual tension?

00:41.494 --> 00:44.226
You think Kyle and Frances
are in a cult?

00:44.276 --> 00:45.984
If he were in a cult, I would know.

00:46.034 --> 00:48.748
Like he knows you're a
maid pretending to be rich?

00:48.798 --> 00:50.789
We finally have your mother's blessing.

00:50.839 --> 00:52.862
You know, Kyle, maybe you
should move back home.

00:52.912 --> 00:54.375
Not being roommates could bring back

00:54.425 --> 00:56.171
some of that romance we've been missing.

00:56.221 --> 00:57.030
We'd like to check the attic.

00:57.080 --> 00:58.198
You don't have to do that.

00:58.248 --> 00:59.685
I noticed Kyle and his mom

00:59.735 --> 01:01.923
being really secretive about the attic.

01:01.973 --> 01:03.185
- Ben?
- I still need to find

01:03.235 --> 01:05.537
the video of Peri confessing her secret.

01:05.587 --> 01:07.724
Maybe that's where they keep the videos.

01:07.774 --> 01:09.084
I can drum up some reason

01:09.134 --> 01:10.733
to sneak in there and snoop around.

01:10.783 --> 01:11.768
I'm Fiona.

01:11.818 --> 01:12.909
I thought you were... in Italy.

01:12.959 --> 01:14.383
You must be Zoila, my maid.

01:22.146 --> 01:24.018
Morning.
-Kyle!

01:24.697 --> 01:25.844
What are you doing here?

01:25.953 --> 01:27.909
I want to take my honey
out to breakfast.

01:27.964 --> 01:28.782
Surprise.

01:28.832 --> 01:30.405
Surprise!

01:30.672 --> 01:32.522
Um, sorry.

01:32.572 --> 01:36.790
Uh... I'm in the middle
of cleaning the house.

01:37.464 --> 01:38.492
The maid didn't show up?

01:38.542 --> 01:39.491
Nope.

01:39.941 --> 01:42.351
She hasn't really been focused
on her job lately.

01:42.401 --> 01:44.360
Sounds like someone's gonna get fired.

01:44.834 --> 01:46.784
That's a real possibility.

01:46.976 --> 01:48.165
How about tomorrow night?

01:48.215 --> 01:50.280
Oh, I'm taking my mother to dinner.

01:50.416 --> 01:51.901
So, you and Frances will
be out of the house?

01:51.951 --> 01:53.178
Just for a couple hours.

01:53.228 --> 01:55.194
- Zoila!
- Who's that?

01:55.244 --> 01:58.533
Um, I have a friend in from out of town.

01:58.583 --> 01:59.416
She got in last night.

01:59.466 --> 02:00.524
Oh, yeah? I'd love to meet her.

02:00.574 --> 02:02.575
No! No. She's very sick.

02:02.625 --> 02:03.918
I don't want you to catch it.

02:03.968 --> 02:05.049
Call me later.

02:11.128 --> 02:12.235
There you are.

02:12.535 --> 02:13.345
Who was that?

02:13.395 --> 02:14.984
Um, just a neighbor.

02:15.151 --> 02:17.850
So, are you settling in okay?

02:17.900 --> 02:19.953
Yes. But it's very strange.

02:20.003 --> 02:23.432
My clothes all seem to be stretched out,

02:23.766 --> 02:26.267
as though they've been worn
by a great big fat person.

02:26.976 --> 02:30.261
Well, no big fat
person has worn your clothes.

02:30.389 --> 02:31.729
I promise.

02:32.475 --> 02:34.384
Zoila, perhaps now would be a good time

02:34.434 --> 02:36.855
for me to clarify my
expectations for you.

02:36.941 --> 02:39.397
Firstly... and this is important...

02:39.908 --> 02:42.055
I expect you to come running
when I call for you.

02:42.105 --> 02:42.905
Like a dog?

02:42.918 --> 02:45.255
Oh, no, not at all.

02:45.305 --> 02:46.468
But, yes, exactly.

02:46.518 --> 02:49.941
Also, my meals will be served
in the formal dining room.

02:50.202 --> 02:51.542
And I'd rather prefer it if you don't

02:51.592 --> 02:53.386
have personal visitors to the house.

02:53.604 --> 02:54.553
Got it.

02:54.603 --> 02:55.705
Lastly,

02:56.106 --> 02:58.366
I like to project a certain image,

02:58.776 --> 03:02.919
so, from now on,
you'll wear a maid's uniform.

03:02.969 --> 03:05.883
Is that really necessary?

03:05.933 --> 03:07.706
It is. When people come by,

03:07.756 --> 03:10.069
they need to know exactly who you are.

03:26.482 --> 03:28.985
ÿCarmen, qué bueno?
I was looking for you.

03:29.035 --> 03:30.833
Ay, Danni. Are you here
to yell at me again?

03:30.883 --> 03:32.200
No, no.

03:32.250 --> 03:33.430
I was just wondering

03:33.480 --> 03:35.622
if you want to have dinner
with me sometime.

03:36.242 --> 03:37.402
Really?

03:37.843 --> 03:40.170
I thought I was the
horrible person who ruined your life.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.898
I was just being dramatic.

03:42.002 --> 03:43.330
I think I get that from you.

03:43.380 --> 03:46.064
So you forgive me, just like that?

03:46.114 --> 03:47.244
Yes.

03:47.592 --> 03:49.994
I tried to see things
from your point of view.

03:50.257 --> 03:52.815
I guess I'm pretty mature
for a teenager.

03:52.865 --> 03:53.740
You're not a teenager.

03:53.790 --> 03:55.320
So, I lie about my age.

03:55.370 --> 03:56.856
I get that from you, too.

03:58.161 --> 04:00.182
Now can we please start over?

04:00.709 --> 04:02.126
I don't want to fight anymore.

04:03.399 --> 04:04.486
Okay.

04:04.968 --> 04:06.101
Yeah.

04:06.336 --> 04:09.192
Danni, this makes me so happy.

04:09.942 --> 04:11.241
Me too.

04:15.143 --> 04:18.075
Great job, everybody, and I'll
see you after recess, okay?

04:20.985 --> 04:22.162
Can I help you, Miguel?

04:22.665 --> 04:25.394
This is wrong. I
should have gotten an "A."

04:25.444 --> 04:27.088
You missed a lot of questions,

04:27.627 --> 04:29.286
so why do you feel you deserve an "A"?

04:29.336 --> 04:31.408
Because my stepfather is in prison.

04:32.193 --> 04:33.247
Well, I'm very sorry about that,

04:33.297 --> 04:34.551
but I can't just give you an "A"

04:34.601 --> 04:36.595
because things are difficult at home.

04:36.912 --> 04:38.423
He killed someone.

04:39.336 --> 04:40.688
Your stepfather?

04:41.124 --> 04:42.777
He might do it again, too.

04:45.248 --> 04:47.629
Miguel, are you suggesting
your step-dad might kill me

04:47.679 --> 04:49.083
if I don't give you an "A"?

04:49.377 --> 04:50.951
Do you really want to risk it?

04:55.700 --> 04:57.479
Miguel said what?

04:57.644 --> 05:00.788
Gail Fleming just
confirmed for tomorrow's book club,

05:00.838 --> 05:03.102
so let's double the alcohol order.

05:03.152 --> 05:04.982
Yes. I will talk to him.

05:05.063 --> 05:06.138
Thank you.

05:07.242 --> 05:08.975
I am so sorry, Mrs. Genevieve,

05:09.025 --> 05:10.561
but that was Miguel's school.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.322
He's been suspended.

05:12.372 --> 05:13.485
What did he do?

05:13.535 --> 05:15.408
He threatened his teacher,

05:15.458 --> 05:17.896
and he's been starting fights
with the other kids.

05:17.946 --> 05:19.178
I don't understand.

05:19.228 --> 05:21.170
Miguel's always been such a sweet boy.

05:21.220 --> 05:24.010
The school thinks it's because
things are bad at home.

05:24.060 --> 05:27.273
Outrageous. Everything's perfect here...

05:27.323 --> 05:30.737
except for Spence being
locked up for Peri's gruesome murder.

05:32.395 --> 05:34.437
Miguel has always looked up to Spence.

05:34.487 --> 05:35.794
Maybe now that he's in jail,

05:35.844 --> 05:38.330
Miguel thinks it's cool
to be a criminal.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.284
Oh. Should I lock up the valuables?

05:41.334 --> 05:44.980
Miguel needs to understand that
going to prison is not cool.

05:45.241 --> 05:48.008
Rosie, have you ever taken Miguel

05:48.058 --> 05:49.800
to visit Spence in prison?

05:49.944 --> 05:51.074
No.

05:51.187 --> 05:53.187
Well, maybe a healthy dose of fear

05:53.237 --> 05:55.065
is just what the boy needs.

05:58.491 --> 06:00.666
How did you enjoy
your first charity potluck?

06:00.716 --> 06:04.165
It was... quaint.

06:05.112 --> 06:08.437
I have never eaten baby back before.

06:08.487 --> 06:10.716
My fingers still smell sweet and tangy.

06:10.766 --> 06:13.559
Don't forget we have the Youth
Outreach Banquet this Thursday.

06:14.484 --> 06:15.674
Don't you ever get tired

06:15.724 --> 06:17.622
of the constant charity functions?

06:17.914 --> 06:19.349
No? Me neither.

06:23.291 --> 06:24.379
What's wrong?

06:25.214 --> 06:26.442
Don't look now.

06:26.492 --> 06:28.438
Adrian's private investigator

06:28.488 --> 06:30.450
is over there taking photographs of us.

06:30.587 --> 06:31.494
Are you sure?

06:31.544 --> 06:33.813
Ooh. Get down on one knee.

06:33.863 --> 06:35.737
Beg your pardon?
-Let's give Adrian something

06:35.787 --> 06:37.463
to sink his teeth into.
Get on one knee.

06:37.513 --> 06:39.995
Pretend to propose to me.

06:41.044 --> 06:42.316
I think we've put Adrian through enough.

06:42.366 --> 06:43.804
Let's take the high road.

06:43.854 --> 06:45.855
But the low road is so much more fun.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.944
Evelyn, no. Okay, look, your husband

06:47.994 --> 06:49.422
is clearly in pain over this divorce,

06:49.472 --> 06:51.179
and we have each other.

06:51.403 --> 06:53.377
Isn't that enough of a victory?

06:54.005 --> 06:56.366
James, you're always so good.

06:57.133 --> 06:59.669
That's what makes you so...

07:00.202 --> 07:01.306
you.

07:08.991 --> 07:10.097
Hi, Derek.

07:11.004 --> 07:12.320
I've been trying to get a hold of Peter,

07:12.370 --> 07:15.047
and I've left, like, a
stalker level of messages.

07:15.097 --> 07:16.090
Is he okay?

07:16.140 --> 07:18.037
He's just a busy man.

07:18.087 --> 07:19.134
Ah, phew.

07:19.184 --> 07:21.439
I was afraid he was
a lying-in-a-ditch man.

07:21.489 --> 07:22.603
Can I see him?

07:22.841 --> 07:24.857
He's out of town... Hawaii.

07:24.907 --> 07:26.289
Hawaii?

07:27.142 --> 07:29.056
We were supposed to
go to Hawaii together.

07:29.174 --> 07:30.639
Can you get him on the phone?

07:30.689 --> 07:32.920
Can't. His cell's broken.

07:35.062 --> 07:36.287
Peter Hudson's office.

07:36.734 --> 07:39.675
4:00? All right. Bye, Peter.

07:42.357 --> 07:43.635
That was Peter.

07:43.774 --> 07:44.702
No, it wasn't.

07:44.752 --> 07:46.542
Okay, why are you blocking me?

07:46.592 --> 07:48.372
I just want to see my boyfriend.

07:48.672 --> 07:49.472
I'm sorry.

07:49.496 --> 07:52.009
Peter doesn't date people
who cheat on him.

07:57.740 --> 07:59.888
And now that Fiona's back,
it's only a matter of time

07:59.938 --> 08:01.908
before Kyle and Frances
realize who I am.

08:01.958 --> 08:03.648
Well, why don't you just
come clean with them?

08:03.698 --> 08:06.083
No. She needs to stay friends with them.

08:06.133 --> 08:07.581
I need her to get into that house

08:07.631 --> 08:10.763
so she can find the video of
Peri confessing her secrets.

08:10.813 --> 08:12.777
What... What is on that video anyway?

08:12.827 --> 08:14.152
Maybe Peri told the cult

08:14.202 --> 08:16.324
about the man who drugged and raped her.

08:16.374 --> 08:18.196
I think he's the killer.

08:18.246 --> 08:20.314
Well, Kyle is taking
Frances out to dinner tonight,

08:20.364 --> 08:23.270
and I know where they
keep their hide-a-key.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.195
I'm going to find that video.

08:25.245 --> 08:27.409
Chicas, check this out!

08:27.459 --> 08:29.478
They're casting the movie
based on Marisol's book.

08:29.528 --> 08:31.113
Already? That was fast.

08:31.163 --> 08:34.239
Yes. And they want unknown
actresses to play the maids,

08:34.328 --> 08:36.581
so, I'm gonna try out.

08:36.631 --> 08:38.563
Well, no one's more unknown than you.

08:38.614 --> 08:42.333
Ooh, maybe Marisol can talk
you up to the director.

08:42.384 --> 08:44.273
Oh, yes, Hugh Metzger,

08:44.323 --> 08:47.229
the man who got me fired
off of my own movie.

08:47.310 --> 08:48.340
He hates me.

08:48.390 --> 08:51.758
Oh. So maybe I shouldn't be
seen in public with you.

08:52.011 --> 08:53.579
What part are you trying out for?

08:53.629 --> 08:55.184
The character based on me.

08:55.275 --> 08:56.390
Okay, oye.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.172
"Carmelita... she's a
hot, sexy maid with big dreams.

08:59.222 --> 09:00.572
Must sing and dance."

09:01.133 --> 09:02.995
Well, Hugh wanted to
change my entire movie,

09:03.045 --> 09:04.782
so I'm sure he ruined my character.

09:04.914 --> 09:09.119
"Maria is cool,
confident, smart as a whip."

09:10.280 --> 09:11.560
I guess he got that right.

09:12.490 --> 09:13.636
This is me.

09:13.962 --> 09:17.775
"Rosario... sweet, beautiful,

09:18.015 --> 09:19.312
oblivious."

09:20.667 --> 09:22.929
Aww  that's so nice.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.200
What about my character?

09:25.631 --> 09:27.210
Nope. No Zoila.

09:27.260 --> 09:28.493
Come on!

09:29.040 --> 09:31.109
Oh, look, "Zelda...

09:31.339 --> 09:34.870
sarcastic, sour, elderly."

09:36.214 --> 09:37.322
Elderly.

09:38.632 --> 09:39.739
Elderly?!

09:42.432 --> 09:44.106
So, I'm on pins and needles here.

09:44.156 --> 09:47.389
Tell me... what have
you found on the reverend?

09:49.153 --> 09:50.263
Nothing.

09:51.356 --> 09:52.516
What do you mean, "nothing"?

09:52.566 --> 09:54.839
No scandals, no lawsuits,
no accusations.

09:54.889 --> 09:56.600
Why the hell do you have
such a thick folder on him?

09:56.650 --> 09:58.426
That seems intentionally misleading.

09:58.476 --> 09:59.622
It's documentation.

09:59.672 --> 10:02.609
I ran background checks,
dug through court records.

10:02.659 --> 10:05.722
I practically crawled up the
man's butt with a flashlight.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.819
Yes. That's evident
from his colonoscopy report.

10:09.149 --> 10:10.443
What's this? Parking ticket.

10:10.493 --> 10:11.295
He paid that.

10:11.345 --> 10:12.170
Ah!

10:12.220 --> 10:14.641
This says he was known
to cavort with prostitutes.

10:14.691 --> 10:17.081
An outreach program to help
get them off the streets.

10:17.131 --> 10:20.165
Oh, come on! Nobody could
be that damn good.

10:20.215 --> 10:22.342
Adrian, I know you want
to destroy this man,

10:22.392 --> 10:24.027
but wouldn't we all be better off

10:24.077 --> 10:27.582
building each other up
rather than tearing each other down?

10:27.716 --> 10:29.076
What are you blathering about?

10:29.126 --> 10:31.197
I sat in on one of the
reverend's sermons...

10:31.247 --> 10:33.165
very inspiring.

10:34.248 --> 10:36.204
Your wife is a lucky woman.

10:42.235 --> 10:43.545
- Marisol.
- Hi.

10:43.595 --> 10:44.606
I'm sorry to bother you at work,

10:44.656 --> 10:46.257
but I need to ask you something.

10:46.307 --> 10:47.507
Okay.

10:48.338 --> 10:51.035
Somehow Peter found out
that we slept together,

10:51.085 --> 10:52.484
and I didn't tell him.

10:52.534 --> 10:54.934
So... did you?

10:55.156 --> 10:56.360
Seriously?

10:56.515 --> 10:58.638
First you turn me down,
and now you're accusing me

10:58.688 --> 11:00.794
of sabotaging your new relationship?

11:00.929 --> 11:01.961
Not awesome.

11:02.011 --> 11:03.639
I'm sorry. Of course you didn't.

11:03.689 --> 11:04.695
It's just that Peter won't talk to me,

11:04.745 --> 11:07.448
so can you please help me
figure out how he found out about us?

11:07.599 --> 11:09.288
Still, not awesome.

11:09.338 --> 11:10.314
You're right. You're right.

11:10.364 --> 11:12.320
This is my problem, not yours.

11:12.370 --> 11:14.371
However Peter found out,
it wasn't through me.

11:14.421 --> 11:17.846
I didn't tell anyone... except...

11:17.896 --> 11:18.820
Except who?

11:18.870 --> 11:20.943
Well, Danni, but you already knew that,

11:20.993 --> 11:22.604
and she wouldn't tell Peter.

11:22.678 --> 11:24.244
And you didn't tell anyone else?

11:24.606 --> 11:26.181
No, no one.

11:27.297 --> 11:28.678
- Except
- Jesse!

11:28.728 --> 11:30.694
Well, it was nothing, and I
didn't even mention your name.

11:30.744 --> 11:32.474
I just told this woman that I train

11:32.524 --> 11:34.645
that I hooked up with an ex.

11:35.034 --> 11:36.759
Genevieve Delatour?

11:37.573 --> 11:38.787
No.

11:38.837 --> 11:40.693
No, no, no, no, no, no!

11:40.743 --> 11:42.613
Genevieve is Peter's ex-wife!

11:43.116 --> 11:44.339
I did not know that.

11:44.670 --> 11:47.677
Clearly she found out
about us and blabbed to Peter,

11:47.948 --> 11:49.729
hoping that he would break up with me.

11:50.002 --> 11:51.011
Wow.

11:51.061 --> 11:53.247
I guess this really was my fault.

11:53.297 --> 11:54.413
No, it wasn't.

11:54.892 --> 11:55.814
Genevieve, on the other hand,

11:55.864 --> 11:59.335
that lying little
witch I'm gonna murder her.

12:03.862 --> 12:05.155
Mmm.

12:05.205 --> 12:07.814
These conjugal visits are
the highlight of my week.

12:08.738 --> 12:10.151
I need to talk to you.

12:10.201 --> 12:12.013
Mmm. Dirty talk.

12:12.251 --> 12:14.368
Actually, it's about Miguel.

12:15.480 --> 12:16.663
And we're out.

12:18.565 --> 12:20.467
He's been acting like a bully at school

12:20.517 --> 12:21.981
and getting into trouble.

12:22.344 --> 12:24.359
I think he's trying to be like you.

12:26.064 --> 12:27.068
Me?

12:27.118 --> 12:28.784
Well, you're a criminal now.

12:28.834 --> 12:30.849
Or at least that's what everyone thinks.

12:30.899 --> 12:33.681
But if he could see how
bad it is in here,

12:33.916 --> 12:35.466
maybe he'd straighten out.

12:36.661 --> 12:39.324
Okay, well, there's this program here

12:39.374 --> 12:40.552
for troubled youth.

12:41.178 --> 12:43.320
It's kind of like a private
tour of the prison.

12:43.496 --> 12:44.805
I'll see if I can get Miguel in.

12:44.855 --> 12:46.661
Well, he's only 10. Is that too young?

12:46.711 --> 12:49.342
I don't think so.
I think the whole point
is to get them young.

12:49.471 --> 12:50.679
Then it's settled.

12:51.074 --> 12:53.038
I knew you'd find a way to help.

12:55.301 --> 12:56.846
I'm sorry. This talk...

12:56.896 --> 12:59.520
it's kind of ruined the moment.

13:00.260 --> 13:01.757
Are you sure...

13:03.911 --> 13:05.692
Mr. Spence?

13:06.818 --> 13:07.947
And we're back.

13:07.997 --> 13:09.100
Mmm.

13:13.227 --> 13:16.996
Ladies, ladies, shall we start
discussing this week's book?

13:17.046 --> 13:19.960
Uh, Diane, I know that you're new,

13:20.010 --> 13:21.990
but book club is really just an excuse

13:22.040 --> 13:24.129
for us to drink in the
middle of the day.

13:24.179 --> 13:25.693
Please. I didn't even read the book.

13:25.743 --> 13:28.560
I have been so busy redecorating
the Powell house...

13:28.610 --> 13:30.179
and trying to seduce Adrian.

13:30.229 --> 13:32.408
You should design an S&M room.

13:32.845 --> 13:36.561
Rumor has it that
Adrian likes to be tied up.

13:36.767 --> 13:38.218
- Really?
- Really?

13:38.528 --> 13:39.410
Tell me more.

13:39.460 --> 13:41.676
Or... we could talk about the book.

13:41.726 --> 13:44.699
Goodness, Diane, learn to read a room.

13:44.749 --> 13:47.514
No one here wants to talk
about the boring book.

13:47.579 --> 13:48.710
Genevieve?

13:49.853 --> 13:52.940
Genevieve... I know what you did.

13:52.990 --> 13:56.029
Marisol. Joining us for book club?

13:56.079 --> 13:58.606
You told Peter about me and Jesse.

13:58.656 --> 13:59.724
I'll take that as a no.

13:59.774 --> 14:02.458
You destroyed my relationship.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.939
You will stop at nothing
to get what you want!

14:04.989 --> 14:06.913
Perhaps you should take this outside.

14:06.963 --> 14:09.158
Zz-bup-bup. Zip it,
Diane. It's just gettin' good.

14:09.208 --> 14:11.067
Peter is my friend.

14:11.437 --> 14:13.246
I had an obligation to tell him

14:13.296 --> 14:15.481
that his girlfriend was deceiving him.

14:15.531 --> 14:17.825
Oh, please. You did this for yourself.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.461
You're the one who cheated.

14:19.511 --> 14:21.992
And now Peter will never take you back.

14:22.269 --> 14:23.503
Sad.

14:26.704 --> 14:28.215
Do you see what she's doing?

14:29.242 --> 14:31.222
She puts on this sunny, sweet veneer,

14:31.272 --> 14:33.629
but, really, the truth is

14:33.679 --> 14:36.568
she's just a self-absorbed, petty,

14:36.618 --> 14:39.090
ruthless bitch.

14:40.633 --> 14:43.391
And that's why you'll always be alone.

14:44.548 --> 14:45.748
Sad.

14:50.448 --> 14:53.418
Listen, being in here is not cool.

14:53.468 --> 14:54.923
There's no freedom, no privacy,

14:54.973 --> 14:57.440
and the guys in here are really scary.

14:57.773 --> 14:59.293
Yo, Westmore!

15:00.164 --> 15:02.245
I saved you my muffin from breakfast.

15:02.431 --> 15:03.426
He seems nice.

15:03.476 --> 15:06.911
Yeah, but, Miguel, this... is Kill Face.

15:06.961 --> 15:08.032
That's his name.

15:08.082 --> 15:09.298
What are you in for, kid?

15:09.348 --> 15:10.994
Shoot up a grocery store?

15:11.099 --> 15:12.056
Kidnap a baby?

15:12.106 --> 15:13.654
Please stop giving him ideas.

15:13.704 --> 15:15.060
Miguel's just visiting.

15:15.256 --> 15:16.339
Cool.

15:16.482 --> 15:17.419
Wrote another play,

15:17.469 --> 15:19.499
and I need you to be the lead.

15:19.549 --> 15:20.481
Another play?

15:20.531 --> 15:21.788
That sounds fun.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.180
No, it's not fun.

15:23.230 --> 15:24.729
Nothing in here is fun.

15:24.779 --> 15:26.242
Come on, man. I already
started building the set,

15:26.292 --> 15:27.918
and you're a bona fide movie star.

15:28.023 --> 15:30.956
Mostly just TV and one
really well-reviewed indie.

15:31.006 --> 15:32.272
Can we talk about this later?

15:32.322 --> 15:33.704
Miguel's been getting
into trouble at school,

15:33.754 --> 15:35.240
and I'm trying to knock
some sense into him.

15:35.290 --> 15:37.859
Ah, a little scared-straight
action, huh?

15:37.909 --> 15:38.979
Got it.

15:40.575 --> 15:42.034
What you got there, kid?

15:42.084 --> 15:43.211
Gummy bears.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.545
You brought gummy bears into my house?

15:46.049 --> 15:48.833
You brought gummy bears into my house?!

15:49.847 --> 15:50.898
Want one?

15:52.010 --> 15:53.543
I do kind of.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.275
No, no. Green, green, green.

15:55.325 --> 15:57.553
Okay, Kill Face, thanks for your help.

15:57.603 --> 16:00.253
Thank you. Mmm.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.765
That's a cool tattoo. I
should get one of those.

16:02.815 --> 16:04.788
I don't think your mother
would like that.

16:05.190 --> 16:07.127
Good. At least she'll notice me.

16:07.881 --> 16:09.279
Hold on. Is that what this is all about?

16:09.329 --> 16:10.451
Are you trying to get
your mom's attention

16:10.501 --> 16:11.756
by getting into trouble?

16:12.599 --> 16:13.791
Oh, come on.

16:13.935 --> 16:16.973
Your mom's the best. She
always has time for you.

16:17.132 --> 16:19.606
No. She's too busy trying to save you.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.193
I never get to see her anymore.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.299
Oh, Miguel.

16:27.083 --> 16:29.113
I'm so sorry.

16:32.439 --> 16:34.279
I'm so getting this part.

16:34.329 --> 16:36.577
"A hot, sexy maid with big dreams.

16:36.627 --> 16:38.374
Must sing and dance."

16:38.666 --> 16:40.455
It's like she was based on me!

16:41.130 --> 16:43.277
Except she was based on Carmen, right?

16:43.327 --> 16:44.427
Mm.

16:44.657 --> 16:45.793
That's why I invited her to dinner...

16:45.843 --> 16:47.775
so I can study her for the audition.

16:48.004 --> 16:50.001
Wait, I-I thought
you'd invited her tonight

16:50.051 --> 16:51.513
'cause you'd forgiven her.

16:51.602 --> 16:54.410
Nah. I'm just pretending to forgive her.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.576
So you're using her
to get a part in a movie?

16:58.027 --> 16:59.507
Isn't that kind of mean?

16:59.869 --> 17:01.412
She was mean to me first.

17:01.502 --> 17:03.880
Well, have you ever considered
being nice to her...

17:04.044 --> 17:05.097
for real?

17:06.030 --> 17:07.380
Why would I do that?

17:12.204 --> 17:14.973
Ooh, my, my! That looks fabulous.

17:15.023 --> 17:17.232
I figured you'd
appreciate a formal table setting.

17:17.281 --> 17:18.320
I meant your uniform.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.728
It's smashing, like you
were born to wear it.

17:20.778 --> 17:24.290
Hmm. Well, have a seat.

17:24.340 --> 17:25.500
Dinner's ready.

17:30.428 --> 17:31.717
Good Lord.

17:31.767 --> 17:34.175
What is all that racket?

17:34.225 --> 17:35.664
It's the neighbors leaving.

17:35.714 --> 17:37.632
Well, I'll have to ask them
to do that less often.

17:37.682 --> 17:41.599
Anyway, I have something to take
care of, so... bon appétit.

17:43.048 --> 17:43.848
Oh, dear.

17:43.884 --> 17:45.669
This is supper.

17:45.953 --> 17:47.765
I was hoping for breakfast.

17:48.414 --> 17:49.803
Breakfast at night?

17:50.377 --> 17:52.519
Well, my jet lag is wreaking havoc

17:52.569 --> 17:53.998
with my internal clock.

17:54.870 --> 17:56.783
I assumed you would
have thought of that.

17:56.848 --> 17:57.655
Silly me.

17:57.705 --> 17:59.276
Oh, it's all right.

17:59.377 --> 18:00.822
I'm sure you never travel.

18:01.499 --> 18:03.404
You know what I would kill for?

18:04.207 --> 18:05.540
A frittata.

18:05.632 --> 18:06.550
Right now?

18:06.600 --> 18:09.013
I-I really need to run that errand.

18:09.238 --> 18:10.249
Oh.

18:10.299 --> 18:11.651
I'm not some wicked tyrant.

18:11.701 --> 18:13.084
You can run your errand.

18:13.134 --> 18:14.131
Thank you.

18:14.181 --> 18:15.881
After you make my frittata.

18:20.229 --> 18:21.605
"So, none of this has been true?

18:21.655 --> 18:23.027
I thought we were friends."

18:23.077 --> 18:24.726
Hola. Ready for dinner?

18:24.776 --> 18:27.917
Oh, shoot. I lost track of time.

18:27.967 --> 18:29.560
Just give me five minutes.

18:30.361 --> 18:31.433
What's that?

18:32.096 --> 18:34.491
Oh, just an audition scene
for Marisol's movie.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.546
I'm trying out tomorrow. There's
a part based on me.

18:38.098 --> 18:39.826
I had no idea.

18:41.289 --> 18:43.360
You know what? Forget dinner.

18:43.410 --> 18:45.287
I want to help with your audition.

18:45.519 --> 18:47.963
Really? That would be amazing.

18:48.013 --> 18:49.527
So, what are you gonna wear?

18:49.577 --> 18:52.203
Okay, I'm thinking about
these heels with my maid's uniform.

18:52.253 --> 18:54.456
Maid's uniform. Good idea.

18:54.774 --> 18:56.378
What do you think about these earrings?

18:56.428 --> 18:57.347
Are they too much?

18:57.397 --> 18:58.875
Perfect. I love them.

18:58.925 --> 19:01.629
Really?
Oh, I have another pair I can give you.

19:01.679 --> 19:03.687
Wow. Thank you.

19:05.083 --> 19:06.163
Okay.

19:06.995 --> 19:08.673
Why are you walking like me?

19:09.293 --> 19:11.627
I admire your confidence.

19:11.746 --> 19:13.166
I want to be just like you.

19:13.216 --> 19:15.696
I get it. Who doesn't
want to be like Carmen Luna?

19:15.746 --> 19:17.244
Who doesn't want to be like Carmen Luna?

19:17.294 --> 19:20.003
No. Kick it up at the end. Carmen Luna!

19:20.053 --> 19:21.981
Carmen Luna!

19:23.159 --> 19:24.219
Aww.

19:24.407 --> 19:26.040
It's like looking in the mirror.

19:26.090 --> 19:28.494
I know! Now let's run your lines.

19:28.544 --> 19:30.331
I want to hear you do the scene.

19:33.996 --> 19:37.353
No, Rosie, I haven't gotten
into Kyle's house yet.

19:37.513 --> 19:39.738
Long story short, my new
boss is a pain in the ass.

19:39.788 --> 19:42.187
But I'm here now. I'll let
you know what I find.

19:42.237 --> 19:43.299
Bye.

19:45.000 --> 19:51.074

20:35.548 --> 20:36.621
Oh, crap.

20:37.135 --> 20:38.765
Dinner was lovely, Kyle.

20:38.815 --> 20:40.444
I'm so glad we're back in a good place.

20:40.494 --> 20:42.311
Me too. I hate that we fought.

20:42.361 --> 20:43.410
Well, it was my fault.

20:43.460 --> 20:46.032
I should've accepted
Zoila from the start.

20:46.082 --> 20:47.151
Mm.

20:47.295 --> 20:50.059
So, how are things with Zoila?

20:50.260 --> 20:51.969
She hasn't broken up with you?

20:52.965 --> 20:54.171
Why would you think that?

20:54.221 --> 20:55.573
Oh, no reason.

20:55.833 --> 20:59.376
Just know, if things were to
ever sour between you two,

20:59.426 --> 21:00.877
your mother's always here for you.

21:01.492 --> 21:02.447
Trust me.

21:02.497 --> 21:06.158
Zoila and I are doing just great.

21:07.584 --> 21:08.651
Zoila!

21:09.626 --> 21:11.490
Hello there, big boy.

21:12.421 --> 21:14.500
Oh, dear God!

21:14.644 --> 21:15.729
Frances!

21:16.341 --> 21:18.179
Oh, no.

21:18.589 --> 21:21.433
I found this sexy maid costume

21:21.483 --> 21:23.378
from Halloween.

21:23.428 --> 21:25.307
I thought I'd come by and surprise you.

21:25.436 --> 21:27.409
Oh! I didn't realize you'd be together.

21:27.459 --> 21:29.792
I am so embarrassed.

21:30.139 --> 21:31.156
Wait.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.006
You don't have to go.

21:32.020 --> 21:33.078
Yes! Yes, I do.

21:33.128 --> 21:35.853
I...can't even look you in the eye.

21:45.630 --> 21:48.849
Why does the air smell
so cheap, yet so delicious?

21:48.899 --> 21:51.356
I'm burying my feelings in moo Shu.

21:51.453 --> 21:54.513
I was burying my feelings in work,

21:54.563 --> 21:57.854
but your version has a greasy
appeal I cannot deny.

21:58.697 --> 22:00.468
So, what are you trying to avoid?

22:01.419 --> 22:05.841
James and I had a chance to play
a delightful prank on Adrian,

22:05.891 --> 22:08.104
but James refused because
he said it was cruel.

22:08.215 --> 22:10.230
- Was it?
- Of course. That was the point.

22:10.280 --> 22:12.856
But Reverend Boring Pants
thought it was a bad idea.

22:14.630 --> 22:18.888
Adrian had his flaws, but at
least things were never dull.

22:19.601 --> 22:20.600
"Flaws"?

22:20.650 --> 22:23.102
He faked paralysis,
froze all your assets,

22:23.152 --> 22:25.604
and locked you out of your
home and that's just this year.

22:25.654 --> 22:27.720
Stop. You're making me nostalgic.

22:28.586 --> 22:31.938
Perhaps the reverend is too nice for me.

22:31.988 --> 22:34.339
Well, of course he is too nice for you,

22:34.491 --> 22:37.034
but for some
reason, he likes you anyway.

22:37.084 --> 22:37.909
Mm.

22:37.959 --> 22:39.669
If you ask me, that's what
you should be focusing on.

22:39.719 --> 22:42.276
You're one to talk. Give me that.

22:42.760 --> 22:44.209
You are pining for Peter,

22:44.259 --> 22:46.330
even though he obviously dumped you.

22:46.380 --> 22:48.734
Meanwhile, Jesse is begging
you to come back,

22:48.784 --> 22:51.054
even though he's clearly
too hot for you.

22:51.104 --> 22:52.206
Hey!

22:52.256 --> 22:54.584
- You have eyes, Marisol.
- Well...

22:54.634 --> 22:57.291
Plus, he's starting his own business,

22:57.341 --> 22:58.917
and he adores you.

22:58.967 --> 23:01.906
I know. Jesse's the perfect guy.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.492
He's just not the perfect guy for me.

23:05.033 --> 23:06.285
And Peter was?

23:06.335 --> 23:07.555
Maybe.

23:09.060 --> 23:10.521
I guess we'll never know.

23:10.915 --> 23:13.194
I didn't realize you were
so taken with Peter.

23:13.244 --> 23:15.996
Neither did I... until he was gone.

23:18.206 --> 23:20.588
I really screwed things up royally, huh?

23:24.490 --> 23:26.119
We're gonna need more moo Shu.

23:27.559 --> 23:29.096
Papito, I talked to Spence,

23:29.146 --> 23:31.888
and I'm sorry I've been so busy lately.

23:31.938 --> 23:35.347
But I'm going to pay more
attention to you starting now.

23:35.568 --> 23:38.261
Rosie, am I too self-absorbed?

23:38.311 --> 23:39.685
I'm talking to Miguel.

23:39.735 --> 23:41.226
This will just take a minute.

23:41.276 --> 23:43.746
Marisol said some
very hurtful things to me,

23:43.796 --> 23:45.782
and I need you to
tell me they're not true.

23:45.832 --> 23:47.078
Not now.

23:47.128 --> 23:50.229
I'm trying to make sure Miguel
doesn't feel ignored.

23:50.366 --> 23:51.999
But now I feel ignored.

23:52.049 --> 23:53.520
Mrs. Genevieve.

23:57.852 --> 24:02.387
Anyway, I'm sorry I haven't
been a very good mami lately,

24:02.476 --> 24:04.899
but I promise to do better, okay?

24:04.957 --> 24:05.777
Okay.

24:05.827 --> 24:08.554
And you've got to apologize
to your teacher

24:08.704 --> 24:10.295
and the kids you bullied.

24:10.684 --> 24:11.659
Do I have to?

24:11.709 --> 24:14.632
Sí, señor. That's what good people do.

24:14.682 --> 24:17.913
When you hurt someone,
you say you're sorry.

24:18.388 --> 24:19.487
Understand?

24:19.740 --> 24:20.867
Yeah, I guess.

24:20.932 --> 24:24.108
Good. Now go on. You have homework.

24:26.769 --> 24:31.310
Now, Mrs. Genevieve, how can I help you?

24:31.384 --> 24:34.102
Actually, you already have.

24:50.710 --> 24:52.679
Um, excuse me.

24:52.777 --> 24:54.842
You're having auditions
for Carmelita today, right?

24:54.892 --> 24:55.912
Yeah.

24:55.962 --> 24:58.671
What's with the... Golden Girls?

24:58.846 --> 25:00.495
Those are the Zeldas.

25:00.701 --> 25:02.565
Carmelitas are over there.

25:04.312 --> 25:07.022
Oh. That makes more sense.

25:16.913 --> 25:17.980
Danni?

25:19.265 --> 25:20.437
What are you doing here?

25:20.487 --> 25:22.663
Same as you. I got an audition.

25:22.713 --> 25:23.916
For Carmelita?

25:24.042 --> 25:25.010
Mm-hmm.

25:25.060 --> 25:26.862
And I think I'm gonna nail it.

25:27.160 --> 25:29.331
I've been... studying.

25:29.655 --> 25:33.286
That's why you wanted
to hang out... to study me?

25:34.258 --> 25:36.053
Did you actually think I forgave you?

25:36.503 --> 25:38.106
I can't believe you used me.

25:38.387 --> 25:41.388
All right, ladies,
next up we have Carmen.

25:41.763 --> 25:44.324
Yeah, th-that's me... Carmen Luna.

25:44.374 --> 25:47.441
Don't you mean "Carmen Luna"?

25:50.317 --> 25:51.612
This way, please.

26:01.944 --> 26:03.983
Uh, Carmen, this is our director,

26:04.033 --> 26:06.166
the very famous Hugh Metzger.

26:06.670 --> 26:07.987
Oh, hey.

26:08.178 --> 26:09.426
Oscar winner two times over,

26:09.476 --> 26:11.161
and all I get is, "Oh, hey."

26:12.844 --> 26:14.404
Go ahead and slate yourself.

26:14.730 --> 26:17.972
Yeah. My name is Carmen Luna,

26:18.022 --> 26:19.914
and I'm reading for Carmelita.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.610
"I've been lying to you, Carmelita.

26:22.660 --> 26:24.024
I'm not really a maid."

26:26.601 --> 26:27.572
Honey, that's your cue.

26:27.622 --> 26:28.908
Oh, I'm so sorry.

26:29.143 --> 26:30.475
Can I start again?

26:31.747 --> 26:32.816
Okay.

26:33.007 --> 26:34.757
"I've been lying to you, Carmelita.

26:34.807 --> 26:36.276
I'm not really a maid."

26:36.326 --> 26:37.914
So, none of this has been true?

26:38.286 --> 26:39.367
I thought we were friends!

26:39.417 --> 26:40.636
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. Hang on.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.611
Um, you know, I know that Carmelita's

26:42.661 --> 26:46.093
supposed to be angry here,
but you still got to be sexy.

26:46.143 --> 26:49.096
Oh, I'm sexy. I'm sexy as hell!

26:49.279 --> 26:50.742
Eh, still angry.

26:50.792 --> 26:51.925
Should we have her read for Zelda?

26:51.975 --> 26:54.806
What? Zelda? I'm not Zelda.

26:54.903 --> 26:56.270
I'm Carmelita.

26:56.335 --> 26:58.196
You know, this character
was based on me.

26:58.420 --> 26:59.709
I know the woman who wrote the book.

26:59.759 --> 27:03.436
Oh. Oh, you know Marisol Suarez?

27:03.689 --> 27:07.209
Uh, yeah. But I hate her.

27:07.369 --> 27:10.077
She's the worst. Am I right?

27:10.664 --> 27:12.186
Thanks for coming by.

27:15.880 --> 27:18.336
Yeah, Rosie, I almost got busted.

27:18.386 --> 27:21.401
But right before, I found a
locked cabinet in the attic.

27:21.451 --> 27:23.171
It could be where they keep the videos.

27:23.221 --> 27:24.811
You got to get into that cabinet.

27:24.861 --> 27:26.300
I know.

27:26.350 --> 27:28.511
I'll try to sneak in their house again.

27:29.154 --> 27:30.963
Oh, that's the door.

27:31.130 --> 27:32.264
I'll call you back.

27:33.851 --> 27:35.731
Oh... Frances.

27:36.825 --> 27:39.127
Ohh. Ohh.

27:40.101 --> 27:41.192
Okay.

27:42.054 --> 27:43.072
Frances.

27:43.122 --> 27:44.255
We need to talk.

27:44.305 --> 27:45.759
Oh, no, no.

27:46.071 --> 27:48.096
You can't come in. I have a houseguest.

27:48.146 --> 27:50.108
She's very sick.
-I'll risk it.

27:50.158 --> 27:51.887
I thought you were gonna
break up with Kyle.

27:51.937 --> 27:53.923
I am. I'm just letting him down gently.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.974
You promised you were going to end it.

27:56.024 --> 27:58.352
- I...
- Zoila, what are you doing?

27:58.480 --> 28:00.698
Oh. Fiona. Hi.

28:00.748 --> 28:02.265
What did I say about having guests?

28:02.315 --> 28:03.666
And why are you wearing my robe?

28:03.716 --> 28:04.878
Um, I was cold.

28:04.928 --> 28:07.440
I'm Frances. I live next door.

28:07.490 --> 28:08.372
But she was just leaving.

28:08.422 --> 28:10.442
I don't care if she's
the Queen of Sheba.

28:10.492 --> 28:12.955
- Take off my robe.
- Zoila, who is this woman?

28:13.005 --> 28:14.480
She's acting like she owns you.

28:14.530 --> 28:16.706
Zoila... now.

28:25.938 --> 28:27.892
Why are you still wearing that?

28:27.942 --> 28:29.291
Because this is my house,

28:29.341 --> 28:31.626
and I like my maid to be in uniform.

28:31.850 --> 28:32.918
Your maid?

28:32.968 --> 28:35.345
Thank you so much for stopping by.

28:35.554 --> 28:37.686
Zoila needs to get back to work now.

28:37.736 --> 28:38.998
I don't pay her to socialize.

28:40.395 --> 28:41.571
Frances, let me explain.

28:41.621 --> 28:45.077
No, no, no. I understand perfectly.

28:47.219 --> 28:49.961
Wait till Kyle hears about this.

28:56.185 --> 28:57.803
Oh, good. Adrian, you're here.

28:57.853 --> 28:59.721
I need a hand with these
tie-backs for the drapes.

28:59.771 --> 29:02.404
My hand is busy feeding me
bourbon at the moment, Gail.

29:02.454 --> 29:03.768
Your other hand is free.

29:07.015 --> 29:08.192
Hold this, please.

29:08.242 --> 29:09.763
- You wouldn't believe my day.
- Mm.

29:09.813 --> 29:12.194
As you know, Evelyn is dating
Reverend Hamilton,

29:12.244 --> 29:14.422
God's favorite child and my archnemesis.

29:14.472 --> 29:15.272
Mm-hmm.

29:15.313 --> 29:17.438
I've been trying to dig
up dirt on the man

29:17.488 --> 29:18.501
- so she'll leave him...
- Hold this.

29:18.551 --> 29:20.364
But he's so virtuous!

29:20.414 --> 29:22.603
I may have to invent a
scandal for him myself.

29:22.653 --> 29:25.277
Ah. Perhaps something
unseemly with a deacon.

29:25.468 --> 29:27.230
That sounds plausible, right?

29:29.536 --> 29:31.818
Gail, what the hell's going on?

29:31.868 --> 29:34.288
I heard you have a penchant for bondage.

29:34.909 --> 29:35.978
So do I.

29:36.964 --> 29:38.368
Gail, stop this at once.

29:39.748 --> 29:40.800
Stop it, you lunatic!

29:40.850 --> 29:43.900
Mmm, name calling. I like it.

29:45.002 --> 29:46.856
Gail... Let's just get these
down where they belong.

29:47.358 --> 29:48.794
Gail, listen to me very carefully.

29:48.844 --> 29:50.237
I am not having sex with you.

29:50.287 --> 29:52.974
I find the very idea
of it... terrifying.

29:53.475 --> 29:55.406
What? Terrifying?

29:55.768 --> 29:56.821
Why?

29:58.511 --> 29:59.714
Dear God.

30:01.046 --> 30:03.398
Evelyn, this isn't what it looks like.

30:03.448 --> 30:05.321
Oh, no, no. I'm I'm sorry.

30:05.371 --> 30:07.562
I... I should have knocked.

30:07.612 --> 30:08.728
Evelyn!

30:09.336 --> 30:10.436
Evelyn!

30:16.095 --> 30:18.452
- You're the maid?
- Keep your voice down.

30:18.893 --> 30:20.758
My boss is asleep inside.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.243
So, was everything a lie, hmm?

30:22.435 --> 30:24.541
Uhm! Your feelings? Us?

30:24.654 --> 30:28.094
Honestly... I really liked you at first.

30:28.332 --> 30:30.449
But then my feelings changed, and...

30:30.757 --> 30:32.211
I didn't know how to tell you.

30:33.535 --> 30:35.969
It seems like you didn't know
how to tell me a lot of things.

30:36.672 --> 30:38.267
Well, I'm not the
only one keeping secrets.

30:38.317 --> 30:40.053
And what's that supposed to mean?

30:40.313 --> 30:41.810
I know about The Circle.

30:43.993 --> 30:45.837
I didn't want to believe it at first

30:46.784 --> 30:48.243
because you're such a sweet guy,

30:48.293 --> 30:51.051
but then I figured out
why someone like you

30:51.101 --> 30:52.024
would be part of a cult.

30:52.074 --> 30:53.217
It's not a cult.

30:53.267 --> 30:54.950
Is that what your mother tells you?

30:56.244 --> 30:57.519
I know you'd do anything for her,

30:57.569 --> 30:59.893
but what your
mother's doing... it's not right.

30:59.943 --> 31:02.375
- She's ruining lives.
- You're pathological.

31:02.425 --> 31:05.030
The Circle framed my friend
Spence for murder.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.991
And he is a good man, just like you.

31:08.264 --> 31:11.239
He does not deserve to go to prison
for the rest of his life.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.241
No. He killed Peri Westmore.

31:13.291 --> 31:15.828
That's what your mother
wants everyone to think.

31:16.888 --> 31:20.409
Look, there is a video of Peri

31:20.459 --> 31:22.039
being interviewed by The Circle.

31:22.089 --> 31:27.143
If we had it, maybe we
can prove Spence is innocent.

31:27.193 --> 31:29.658
You want me to betray
my own mother for you?

31:30.270 --> 31:32.326
I don't even know who you are anymore.

31:33.078 --> 31:34.537
I'm still Zoila.

31:35.363 --> 31:39.631
I wear a uniform, I'm
not rich, but I'm still me.

31:40.759 --> 31:43.869
And I need your help.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.119
Please.

31:49.382 --> 31:50.436
I'm sorry.

31:51.297 --> 31:52.357
I can't.

31:53.531 --> 31:55.426
Then I don't know who you are, either.

32:05.128 --> 32:07.902
First, let me apologize for
being on your side of the house.

32:07.952 --> 32:10.358
It's fine. I was just on my way out.

32:10.408 --> 32:11.522
Please move.

32:11.572 --> 32:14.403
But I wanted to explain
what you saw earlier with Gail.

32:14.453 --> 32:16.545
Why should you explain?
There's nothing to explain.

32:16.595 --> 32:18.271
It's just that you
need to know Gail and I...

32:18.321 --> 32:19.416
Stop!

32:20.936 --> 32:22.027
We're adults...

32:22.520 --> 32:23.819
adults who are getting a divorce.

32:23.869 --> 32:25.707
I couldn't care less
with whom you spend your time.

32:28.807 --> 32:31.205
However, when your penis falls off

32:31.255 --> 32:32.745
after being with Gail Fleming,

32:32.795 --> 32:35.331
please deposit it in
the appropriate trash bin.

32:38.871 --> 32:40.474
Carmen, did you hear that?

32:41.782 --> 32:43.420
About your penis falling off?

32:43.705 --> 32:45.321
Yeah. That was pretty good.

32:45.371 --> 32:48.765
No. Evelyn is jealous of me and Gail.

32:49.592 --> 32:51.549
I've been going about this all wrong.

32:51.599 --> 32:53.283
That's what I've been telling you.

32:53.333 --> 32:56.150
Cutting off her money and
making her life miserable...

32:56.286 --> 32:57.547
that's too crazy.

32:58.346 --> 33:00.560
Well, hang on to your feather duster.

33:01.369 --> 33:03.505
It's about to get crazier.

33:08.670 --> 33:10.932
Did Spence Westmore really murder Peri?

33:11.005 --> 33:14.668
Of course he did. Why are you asking?

33:14.896 --> 33:16.739
Zoila says he's innocent.

33:17.673 --> 33:20.683
Well, she's lying... again.

33:21.102 --> 33:23.308
But if Spence really is guilty,

33:23.358 --> 33:25.902
why did Ben have to manipulate
him into confessing?

33:26.029 --> 33:29.168
Spence just needed an
extra push to tell the truth.

33:29.218 --> 33:32.647
And besides, we didn't want
the police looking into us.

33:33.975 --> 33:35.711
So you were just protecting The Circle?

33:36.301 --> 33:38.297
Kyle, it's time to make a choice...

33:38.347 --> 33:40.579
Zoila or your mother.

33:42.664 --> 33:44.520
You, of course.

33:44.928 --> 33:45.995
Good.

33:46.107 --> 33:48.060
Because Zoila has infiltrated us,

33:48.110 --> 33:50.774
and everything we've
built is in jeopardy.

33:52.388 --> 33:54.123
You know what we have to do.

33:58.891 --> 34:02.127
Look, I know you were just using me,

34:02.513 --> 34:04.899
but the truth is, I enjoy
spending time with you.

34:04.949 --> 34:06.016
Uh-huh.

34:06.744 --> 34:08.274
Danni, we can't keep doing this.

34:08.324 --> 34:09.435
I don't want to be fighting with you

34:09.485 --> 34:12.065
over some stupid movie
we're never gonna get.

34:12.668 --> 34:13.915
I got a callback.

34:15.284 --> 34:16.289
You did?

34:16.339 --> 34:18.748
Yep... for the part based on you.

34:18.799 --> 34:21.592
They want me to wear something
sexy for the next round.

34:23.315 --> 34:25.118
Well, congratulations.

34:25.806 --> 34:27.222
I thought you'd be jealous.

34:27.333 --> 34:28.386
I am.

34:29.655 --> 34:31.175
But I'm also happy for you.

34:32.333 --> 34:33.632
You don't mean that.

34:33.855 --> 34:36.297
Yeah, I do.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.261
I like this one.

34:45.867 --> 34:47.373
You look amazing in red.

35:00.201 --> 35:01.278
Good morning.

35:01.609 --> 35:03.270
Oh, if you say so.

35:03.320 --> 35:05.616
I didn't get a wink of sleep last night.

35:05.666 --> 35:08.233
- Still jet-lagged?
- Actually, no.

35:08.297 --> 35:11.442
It was all the noise from
those ghastly moving trucks.

35:11.867 --> 35:12.582
What?

35:12.632 --> 35:15.121
Yes. Those hideous people next door

35:15.171 --> 35:16.788
moved out in the middle of the night.

35:16.838 --> 35:18.199
Can you believe the nerve?

35:18.610 --> 35:19.708
Oh, my God.

35:20.527 --> 35:21.619
No.

35:26.629 --> 35:29.274
- Bueno?
- Rosie, they're gone.

35:29.534 --> 35:30.593
Who?

35:30.961 --> 35:33.165
Kyle and Frances they're gone...

35:33.749 --> 35:36.178
and so is our chance
to get Spence out of jail.

35:40.780 --> 35:42.181
The Circle is gone?

35:42.231 --> 35:43.330
Zoila went next door,

35:43.380 --> 35:45.308
and the place was cleaned out.

35:45.852 --> 35:48.047
But don't worry. I'm not giving up.

35:48.964 --> 35:50.312
Well, maybe you should.

35:51.456 --> 35:52.389
Spence.

35:52.439 --> 35:55.137
You trying to get me out
of here is ruining our family.

35:55.551 --> 35:57.175
This thing with Miguel
never would have happened

35:57.225 --> 35:58.206
if I wasn't in jail.

35:58.256 --> 36:00.512
But that's not your fault.
-It doesn't matter.

36:01.247 --> 36:02.047
You deserve a life,

36:02.082 --> 36:04.063
and Miguel deserves a mother
who has time for him.

36:04.113 --> 36:05.576
He has one.

36:05.829 --> 36:06.858
I'll find a way.

36:06.908 --> 36:08.957
Rosie, I'm not getting out of here.

36:10.813 --> 36:12.178
You got to let this go.

36:12.517 --> 36:13.657
I can't.

36:14.495 --> 36:15.344
You are my husband,

36:15.394 --> 36:18.498
and I will never give
up on you, no matter what.

36:21.398 --> 36:23.836
You know, and this kid's
clearly stolen the money

36:23.886 --> 36:26.625
from the collection plate,
so I look at him and I say...

36:26.675 --> 36:28.721
Forgive me, James,
but is this another story

36:28.771 --> 36:30.213
that ends with you forgiving
a ne'er-do-well

36:30.263 --> 36:31.920
and buying him a warm meal?

36:32.733 --> 36:34.214
Evelyn, are you okay?

36:34.749 --> 36:38.572
It's not you. It's...

36:38.622 --> 36:41.809
I walked in on Adrian and
a former friend of mine...

36:42.242 --> 36:43.834
having relations.

36:43.923 --> 36:45.278
Oh, I'm so sorry.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.496
It's not as though I
haven't caught Adrian

36:47.546 --> 36:49.135
in compromising situations before.

36:49.185 --> 36:51.181
He is an accomplished sexual deviant.

36:51.892 --> 36:53.024
It's over now.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.851
But this woman...
Gail! She's so far beneath him.

36:57.901 --> 36:59.514
She's not... and I
mean this in all modesty...

36:59.564 --> 37:00.967
nearly as attractive as I am.

37:01.017 --> 37:02.938
I just don't
understand what he sees in her.

37:04.106 --> 37:08.028
Evelyn, do you still have
feelings for Adrian?

37:08.565 --> 37:09.726
That's absurd.

37:10.603 --> 37:13.137
No. I just know Adrian. That's all.

37:13.564 --> 37:15.592
He could never be happy
with a woman like her.

37:16.152 --> 37:17.952
You know, when we first started
seeing each other,

37:18.002 --> 37:19.234
you told me your marriage was over.

37:19.284 --> 37:20.355
It is.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.821
Maybe it's not as over as you think.

37:25.783 --> 37:27.750
I'm... I'm sorry, Evelyn.

37:28.003 --> 37:29.190
I can't do this.

37:38.760 --> 37:40.188
Ah, there you are.

37:40.238 --> 37:41.568
Oh, uh, hi.

37:41.618 --> 37:43.451
Sorry. Um, I don't need to do this now.

37:43.501 --> 37:44.823
I will just get out of your hair.

37:44.873 --> 37:47.294
No, no, Gail, it's fine. Can we talk?

37:47.344 --> 37:48.680
Really, th-there's nothing
to talk about.

37:48.730 --> 37:51.379
I get it. You said
you were terrified of me.

37:51.678 --> 37:53.663
Yes. I'm terrified
because I can barely contain

37:53.713 --> 37:55.449
the flood of feelings I have for you.

37:56.658 --> 37:58.475
I can't deny it any longer.

37:59.399 --> 38:00.482
Excuse me?

38:01.179 --> 38:03.236
I decided to give Evelyn her divorce

38:03.286 --> 38:08.523
because I realized, Gail,
I am... madly in love with you.

38:09.283 --> 38:12.058
Oh, my God, Adrian.

38:17.585 --> 38:18.439
Hey, Kill Face...

38:18.489 --> 38:21.720
Geez, man! Never sneak up on me.

38:21.770 --> 38:24.484
Sorry. Anyway, I read your play,

38:24.534 --> 38:27.865
and I have some thoughts...

38:27.915 --> 38:29.609
that it's perfect.

38:29.659 --> 38:30.625
Don't change a thing.

38:30.675 --> 38:34.559
Dude, say what you want.

38:34.609 --> 38:35.996
I don't care about the script.

38:36.046 --> 38:37.001
Huh?

38:37.051 --> 38:38.667
It's all about the sets.

38:39.084 --> 38:42.825
You see, when I do a play,
I get special access to tools.

38:43.248 --> 38:46.698
But some tools don't
make it back to the workshop.

38:50.881 --> 38:51.959
Oh, my God.

38:52.467 --> 38:53.927
Is that a tunnel?

38:53.977 --> 38:56.177
Yep, and it's almost finished.

38:56.436 --> 38:57.712
I'm getting out of here.

38:59.310 --> 39:00.517
You coming with me?

39:04.763 --> 39:05.867
Marisol...

39:06.909 --> 39:09.970
I'm sorry I
interfered in your relationship.

39:10.205 --> 39:11.560
I'm not gonna lie.

39:11.610 --> 39:13.244
I'm surprised to hear you say that.

39:13.294 --> 39:15.157
I'm not usually like this.

39:15.473 --> 39:17.426
It's just Peter.

39:17.951 --> 39:20.209
I never meant to cheat on him,

39:20.512 --> 39:22.712
so I'll always be trying
to make things right.

39:22.762 --> 39:25.259
What do you mean, you never
meant to cheat on him?

39:25.371 --> 39:27.426
How do you accidentally cheat?

39:27.773 --> 39:29.661
I was at a party one night.

39:30.227 --> 39:31.779
Peter was working late,

39:32.126 --> 39:34.963
so I was chatting
with a colleague of his.

39:36.222 --> 39:40.037
The next thing I
knew, I woke up in his bed.

39:41.213 --> 39:42.417
Wait. What?

39:43.806 --> 39:45.230
Were you drinking?

39:45.553 --> 39:47.244
I'd had half a cocktail.

39:47.848 --> 39:50.600
It must have been stronger
than I realized

39:50.650 --> 39:53.678
because I don't remember
anything after that.

39:54.814 --> 39:57.226
You don't black out
from half a cocktail.

39:58.790 --> 40:03.731
Is it possible that this man
put something in your drink?

40:05.382 --> 40:07.204
I've always wondered about that.

40:08.438 --> 40:10.771
It certainly would explain things.

40:10.821 --> 40:14.598
Genevieve... you didn't cheat.

40:15.949 --> 40:18.562
What happened to you... that's...

40:21.163 --> 40:22.278
that's rape.

40:25.166 --> 40:27.408
Nobody called it that back then.

40:28.504 --> 40:31.089
It wasn't violent. He was a friend.

40:31.139 --> 40:34.101
He drugged you and had sex
with you without your consent.

40:34.151 --> 40:37.568
That's a crime, no matter who does it.

40:38.537 --> 40:39.842
I suppose it is.

40:41.399 --> 40:42.707
Did you tell anyone?

40:43.585 --> 40:46.786
He's a very
well-known person in Hollywood.

40:47.540 --> 40:49.230
I doubt anyone would have believed me.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.661
I believe you.

40:51.849 --> 40:53.366
And I won't say a word.

40:55.283 --> 40:56.339
But...

40:58.139 --> 40:59.235
who was it?

41:02.291 --> 41:04.625
Hugh Metzger...

41:04.675 --> 41:05.776
the director.

41:11.881 --> 41:12.983
Mr. Metzger?

41:13.517 --> 41:14.377
Hi.

41:14.427 --> 41:15.240
Where is everybody?

41:15.290 --> 41:17.161
Oh, I-I like to do callbacks alone.

41:17.211 --> 41:20.048
I mean, having other people
around just gets in the way.

41:20.098 --> 41:22.197
Ah. So, it's just gonna be you and me?

41:22.247 --> 41:23.888
That's right.

41:25.484 --> 41:26.857
Come on in.
