WEBVTT

00:04.037 --> 00:05.704
(both grunting)

00:09.442 --> 00:11.377
Hold your fire!
We got them.

00:11.379 --> 00:14.380
Put down the memory drive
and maybe we'll let you live.

00:17.050 --> 00:18.784
Nick fury?
Black widow?

00:18.786 --> 00:21.120
Okay, now I know
you're messing with me.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.422
You could've handled
a couple of m.O.D.O.K.'s
a.I.M. Goons

00:23.424 --> 00:24.690
With your other eye closed.

00:25.026 --> 00:28.761
You only return my calls
if you smell a fight.

00:28.763 --> 00:30.062
That's not true.

00:32.064 --> 00:33.365
Okay, that's true.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.067
What do you want
to talk about, boss?

00:35.069 --> 00:36.201
The memory drive!

00:36.203 --> 00:37.336
This?

00:39.039 --> 00:40.339
(grunts)

00:41.241 --> 00:42.741
I got him!
Ahh!

00:42.743 --> 00:44.777
We need to talk about
your new playmate.

00:44.779 --> 00:46.512
One in particular.

00:46.514 --> 00:48.080
(yells)

00:49.449 --> 00:51.283
(roaring)
(video game noises)

00:51.285 --> 00:53.118
(growls)

00:53.753 --> 00:54.820
(grunts)

00:55.488 --> 00:58.123
Ugh!
Why are the buttons
so small?

00:58.125 --> 00:59.691
Hawkeye: Come on,
it's about finesse,

00:59.693 --> 01:02.194
Not growling
and pounding things.

01:02.196 --> 01:03.495
(growls)

01:07.367 --> 01:08.700
Just a game, hulk...

01:08.702 --> 01:10.803
That you lost.
To me...

01:11.137 --> 01:12.337
Again.

01:12.339 --> 01:13.472
Jerk.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.074
The hulk is the hulk.

01:15.076 --> 01:17.242
He growls,
eats like a pig,
and smashes.

01:17.244 --> 01:21.680
And have you formulated
a straightforward plan
to take him out...

01:23.349 --> 01:25.117
If he ever loses control?

01:25.119 --> 01:27.252
What did we just steal?

01:27.254 --> 01:28.687
Under m.O.D.O.K.'s leadership,

01:28.689 --> 01:31.290
A.I.M has been experimenting
with gamma energy.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.624
If they can make a hulk,

01:32.626 --> 01:34.760
Maybe s.H.I.E.L.D
can reverse engineer the tech

01:34.762 --> 01:35.794
To stop a hulk.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.229
But hulk's with us.

01:39.532 --> 01:40.599
(grunts)

01:46.840 --> 01:48.540
Call me over-cautious,

01:48.542 --> 01:51.677
But I think a rampaging
rage monster should have
an off-switch.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.112
Don't you?

01:54.114 --> 01:56.715
Let's see if he wins
this game.

01:58.384 --> 02:01.320
Hey, mean green.
Lend a hand?

02:02.856 --> 02:05.190
The science maybe
a little over your head.

02:05.192 --> 02:07.860
Just push while I test
the thrusters.

02:07.862 --> 02:09.895
(growls)

02:09.896 --> 02:11.363
(hulk grunts)

02:11.664 --> 02:14.566
Iron man:
I said push,
not pulverize.

02:14.701 --> 02:18.170
Your instructions
must've been over my head.

02:18.172 --> 02:19.671
(grunts)

02:24.811 --> 02:27.379
Hulk's alone.
What do we do?

02:27.381 --> 02:28.847
Let's have some fun.

02:31.618 --> 02:34.653
If hulk ever lost control,
it would be very, very bad.

02:36.723 --> 02:39.691
We have no idea how strong
he really is, natasha.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.194
He's what fail-safes
are invented for.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.295
Good point.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.597
I'll get you
a contingency plan.

02:45.599 --> 02:46.765
Huh?

02:47.700 --> 02:49.902
If the hulk ever did
lose control,

02:49.904 --> 02:51.904
We'd all wind up smashed.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074

03:07.820 --> 03:09.488
Blood brother 1:
Hit him fast, hit him hard!

03:09.490 --> 03:11.924
Drop that freak,
blood brother-style!

03:13.927 --> 03:15.494
(hulk roars)

03:20.200 --> 03:21.500
(strains)

03:25.505 --> 03:26.872
(roars)

03:27.874 --> 03:29.208
(horn honks)

03:33.746 --> 03:35.681
Ha! Isn't every day
the blood brothers

03:35.683 --> 03:37.916
Get to hit someone
who gets back up again.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.487
If you like that,

03:42.489 --> 03:44.957
Wait till I start
hitting back!

03:48.995 --> 03:50.529
K.O. Time?

03:50.897 --> 03:51.930
Not yet.

03:53.533 --> 03:54.800
What's the deal?

03:54.802 --> 03:57.669
New episode
of     <i>christmas colors</i>
<i>gone wild?</i>

03:57.671 --> 04:00.839
They want to smash.
Hulk smashes better!

04:00.841 --> 04:02.941
You're the best
there is at what you do.

04:08.881 --> 04:11.717
I'm the only one that gets
to knock out hawkeye!

04:11.951 --> 04:13.585
Now?
Not yet.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.820
(captain america
clears throat)

04:16.889 --> 04:18.322
Mind if we tag in?

04:19.559 --> 04:22.794
It's like a mutated
christmas tree
threw up all over 23rd street.

04:22.796 --> 04:25.998
All ready cracked that one.
And something else. Ow.

04:26.633 --> 04:27.866
Want to fight?

04:29.602 --> 04:30.669
(grunts)

04:31.704 --> 04:32.971
(straining)

04:34.874 --> 04:36.041
Huh?

04:36.043 --> 04:37.376
(grunts)

04:38.778 --> 04:39.878
Ahh!

04:41.914 --> 04:43.282
The blood brothers,

04:43.284 --> 04:45.317
Alien wrestling washouts.

04:45.319 --> 04:47.986
Now they're
intergalactic thugs
for hire.

04:48.821 --> 04:50.022
Now?

04:50.024 --> 04:51.556
Yeah, now.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.592
(buzzing)

04:54.327 --> 04:55.727
<i>Sayonara, </i> suckers.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.766
(electricity crackles)

05:01.734 --> 05:02.934
Hulk, let me see that.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.369
(roars)

05:04.771 --> 05:06.038
(crackling)

05:10.943 --> 05:11.877
(screams)

05:14.013 --> 05:15.981
They're trying
to cover their escape.

05:19.552 --> 05:21.420
Iron man: Hulk, disengage.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.988
We have to scan
that thing on your...

05:22.990 --> 05:24.890
Oh, who am I talking to?

05:24.892 --> 05:25.957
Stop!

05:26.526 --> 05:27.793
(roars)

05:28.361 --> 05:29.728
(electricity crackles)

05:30.029 --> 05:31.530
(groans)

05:35.369 --> 05:39.805
It's using the hulk's
gamma energy to power up.

05:39.807 --> 05:40.906
Bio-tanks.

05:41.441 --> 05:42.607
(growls)

05:46.779 --> 05:48.380
Falcon, funnel now!

05:48.748 --> 05:49.948
(coughs)

05:49.950 --> 05:51.550
Oh, boy.

05:57.423 --> 05:58.623
(coughs)

06:01.594 --> 06:02.728
No.

06:05.698 --> 06:06.798
Hawkeye!

06:07.567 --> 06:08.633
Ah!

06:09.936 --> 06:11.036
(roars)

06:13.806 --> 06:16.541
I funneled that
gas into space.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.710
What was it?

06:19.912 --> 06:21.780
Whoa!
That's not good.

06:21.782 --> 06:22.948
Thank you, falcon.

06:23.483 --> 06:26.017
Stupid falling cars.

06:29.155 --> 06:32.724
The gamma genome project!
My biological prototypes
are gone!

06:32.726 --> 06:35.494
There's only two people
who had the security card.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.896
Me and you!
I am aware.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.164
I took them.

06:39.632 --> 06:42.734
What?
Why would you do that?

06:42.736 --> 06:45.470
The subjects
were too unstable!

06:45.738 --> 06:49.808
Your a.I.M agents
couldn't guard
a simple memory drive.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.577
I took matters
into my own hands.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.446
It is done?

06:54.448 --> 06:56.047
<i>You got what you paid for.</i>

06:56.182 --> 06:58.016
<i>What about our mon...</i>

06:58.018 --> 07:00.786
Sit back and watch, m.O.D.O.K.

07:00.788 --> 07:04.923
As I transform your failure
into my success.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.928
Hulk, turns out s.H.I.E.L.D
doesn't trust you.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.831
Got any weakness
we can exploit?

07:12.833 --> 07:14.566
Like that's gonna work.

07:19.038 --> 07:21.072
<i>Jarvis, open up.</i>

07:21.541 --> 07:24.743
Sorry, natasha,
that's not such a hot idea.

07:25.077 --> 07:27.946
<i>We're feeling a little green</i>
<i>around the gills in here.</i>

07:28.481 --> 07:30.449
<i>You can laugh,</i>
<i>go ahead.</i>

07:30.451 --> 07:33.819
I am laughing, inside.
What happened?

07:33.821 --> 07:35.987
<i>Biological weapon,</i>
<i>gamma energy.</i>

07:35.989 --> 07:37.489
<i>We dispersed it into space</i>

07:37.491 --> 07:40.459
<i>But not before catching</i>
<i>a dose of "gamma flu" .</i>

07:40.960 --> 07:42.160
I'm running tests.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.662
I'm coming in.
<i>No!</i>

07:43.863 --> 07:46.798
<i>I mean, no, please.</i>

07:46.800 --> 07:48.500
<i>Look, it's airborne.</i>

07:48.502 --> 07:51.136
<i>When we came back,</i>
<i>thor got infected too.</i>

07:51.138 --> 07:54.206
Tower's locked down until
we can get this under control.

07:54.208 --> 07:56.875
<i>Sorry.</i>
<i>Wait, what about the hulk?</i>

07:59.011 --> 08:02.614
Yeah. Like a lock
has ever stopped me before.

08:10.756 --> 08:13.992
Stay calm or I will smash you.

08:14.627 --> 08:17.896
Calm? You tell me
to stay calm?

08:18.097 --> 08:20.265
We're out of pizza bagels!

08:20.666 --> 08:22.934
Hmm?
Huh?

08:23.102 --> 08:24.636
(groans)

08:24.638 --> 08:25.804
(rumbling)

08:25.806 --> 08:28.273
Stupid doors!
That's the fifth one!

08:28.708 --> 08:29.941
Where you trying to go?

08:32.178 --> 08:35.780
There are six
more bathrooms.
Concentrate.

08:35.948 --> 08:38.082
Pretend the door knob
is an egg.

08:38.583 --> 08:41.086
Pretend everything is an egg.

08:41.587 --> 08:42.988
(whines)

08:44.891 --> 08:46.024
Wow.

08:46.793 --> 08:50.228
I already ate all
the pizza bagels
in the freezer!

08:50.230 --> 08:52.097
Hawkeye:
Pizza bagels!

08:52.099 --> 08:55.000
You just turned
into a living reactor.

08:55.167 --> 08:56.735
You need fuel.

08:56.936 --> 08:59.004
Is this what it's like
for you all the time?

08:59.006 --> 09:01.039
Thor: I'm a monster!

09:01.041 --> 09:03.108
Yeah, sort of.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.310
(grunts) no!

09:06.546 --> 09:08.747
So that's what it's like
to live with me.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.715
I'd hate living with me.

09:12.985 --> 09:15.253
Iron man:
Okay, biological.

09:16.255 --> 09:19.858
Gamma.
Gamma energy carried on...

09:20.560 --> 09:23.595
Jarvis:  <i>I'm searching</i>
<i>for the virus</i>
<i>in your blood stream, sir.</i>

09:23.597 --> 09:25.196
Remember not...
I know!

09:28.601 --> 09:29.968
Tony.
Natasha?

09:30.236 --> 09:31.937
I told you to...
Stop.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.705
Clearly time is the enemy.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.807
What's happening
and how do I help?

09:35.809 --> 09:39.911
It's a virus
infused with
gamma energy.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.846
Once in the blood stream,

09:41.848 --> 09:44.115
It simulates the effects
of hulk-ish-ness.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.351
Hulk-osity?
Jarvis:  <i>Worse.</i>

09:46.353 --> 09:48.787
<i>The virus is unstable.</i>

09:48.789 --> 09:50.755
<i>If the gamma energy</i>
<i>isn't dispersed,</i>

09:50.757 --> 09:52.223
<i>It will build</i>
<i>to critical levels.</i>

09:52.225 --> 09:53.959
<i>And the avengers</i>
<i>will detonate.</i>

09:53.961 --> 09:56.728
Don't interrupt me!
(grunts)

09:56.730 --> 09:58.029
Stupid computer.

10:04.036 --> 10:05.637
Tony?

10:08.341 --> 10:10.342
Stark smash!

10:12.678 --> 10:14.613
(roars)

10:14.947 --> 10:17.983
Stark fix!
Leave stark alone!

10:23.923 --> 10:25.156
(roars)

10:25.158 --> 10:26.658
Last time,

10:26.660 --> 10:29.227
Calm down or get knocked down.

10:29.729 --> 10:31.630
Go to your happy place!
(knuckles crack)

10:31.964 --> 10:35.300
Listen to hulk.
We have to wait for stark.

10:35.901 --> 10:39.738
Falcon smarter than stark.
He should be in that lab.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.072
Uh, I mean, me.

10:41.074 --> 10:43.942
Me should...
(roars)

10:43.944 --> 10:45.377
Want to cry about it?

10:46.012 --> 10:49.848
Go home to momma
and get me some cookies!

10:49.982 --> 10:51.216
Leave him alone!

10:56.022 --> 10:57.122
Enough!

10:58.891 --> 11:01.059
Sit down and be...
(grunts)

11:01.293 --> 11:03.028
No command me!

11:08.768 --> 11:09.868
(growls)

11:12.405 --> 11:14.873
You aren't well, thor.

11:16.942 --> 11:18.143
Hmm?

11:20.680 --> 11:21.913
Oh, no.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.048
(grunts)

11:27.920 --> 11:29.220
(shield crashes)

11:35.928 --> 11:38.730
It's different seeing me
from your side.

11:38.732 --> 11:41.399
That's why everyone's
so mad at me all the time?

11:41.401 --> 11:44.002
Widow!
Always spying on us.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.203
Fury's pet.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.871
Easy, boys.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.307
I need you to listen.
You're sick.

11:49.309 --> 11:52.744
If you don't get
help, you'll...
Well, explode.

11:54.246 --> 11:55.714
No talk! Go!

12:02.822 --> 12:03.955
(grunts)

12:04.390 --> 12:05.824
(laughs)

12:07.359 --> 12:09.127
(loud banging)

12:10.196 --> 12:12.097
Hulk, this is
an a.I.M viral weapon.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.431
If we don't cure them now...

12:13.433 --> 12:14.733
Boom.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.235
Gamma expert, remember?

12:18.037 --> 12:19.437
Fury:  <i>Widow?</i>

12:20.106 --> 12:21.940
Hold that thought.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.075
Fury, this is
not a good time.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.311
How's the hulk
contingency coming along?

12:26.746 --> 12:28.880
<i>Ready to give me</i>
<i>the memory drive back yet?</i>

12:28.882 --> 12:30.515
Contingency plan?

12:31.183 --> 12:35.053
Until five minutes ago,
I was the only hulk
in this tower.

12:35.055 --> 12:38.389
You looking for a way
to shut me down, too?

12:38.391 --> 12:39.958
Hulk, I...

12:39.960 --> 12:41.926
Make sure they stay inside.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.929
They don't,
you'll need
that contingency.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.030
Wait!

12:48.400 --> 12:49.501
(sighs)

12:51.871 --> 12:52.971
(grunting)

12:57.276 --> 12:59.944
Want pizza bagels!

13:06.485 --> 13:07.986
(roaring)

13:11.824 --> 13:14.025
(sighs) this is
gonna go well.

13:15.161 --> 13:17.295
Hulk? Hulk,
what are you doing?

13:17.297 --> 13:19.264
Why are we in the middle
of nowhere?

13:19.266 --> 13:20.465
Talk to me!

13:21.000 --> 13:22.934
Talk to you?
Can't trust you.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.269
Me? I...

13:24.503 --> 13:27.372
Avengers or s.H.I.E.L.D?
Fury or us?

13:27.374 --> 13:29.374
I'm angry, not dumb.

13:30.442 --> 13:32.043
I guess that's fair.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.444
Tell the truth.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.080
One.
A real truth.

13:36.882 --> 13:39.517
Before today, I didn't
really trust you either.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.252
I thought you were
like a cornered animal

13:41.254 --> 13:43.421
Ready to snap
at the closest hand.

13:43.423 --> 13:47.025
But while everyone else
is acting like monsters,
you're not.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.860
You're the only one
in control.

13:49.862 --> 13:53.031
Always in control.
Have to be.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.833
Otherwise I'd be like them.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.835
I'm not like them.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.070
(grunts)

14:01.907 --> 14:03.041
Banner made it.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.876
I hid it.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.845
It's light.
What does it do?

14:06.979 --> 14:08.847
Gamma energy siphon.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.882
This will destroy
the gamma virus

14:10.884 --> 14:13.384
And avengers will go back
to being puny.

14:13.919 --> 14:17.889
Wait. What would
this thing do to you?

14:18.057 --> 14:20.525
I'm practically
a gamma reactor.

14:20.527 --> 14:24.262
Turn this thing on me,
it would turn me to ash.

14:24.264 --> 14:27.332
Come on,
they're just gonna
get stronger.

14:32.905 --> 14:34.439
Understand the plan?

14:34.573 --> 14:38.176
So simple even
a s.H.I.E.L.D agent
could handle it.

14:38.178 --> 14:41.946
We sneak back into the tower
and take them out one by one,

14:41.948 --> 14:44.015
So long as it stays contained.

14:44.316 --> 14:45.917
(loud explosion)
what?

14:47.586 --> 14:49.454
Avengers, smash!

14:50.956 --> 14:52.590
New plan.

14:55.261 --> 14:57.028
Avengers, smash!

14:59.398 --> 15:01.032
Hulk: Widow!

15:09.909 --> 15:11.309
(groans)

15:11.944 --> 15:13.011
(gasps)

15:14.446 --> 15:15.546
Huh?

15:15.548 --> 15:17.148
(yells)

15:21.220 --> 15:22.320
Huh?

15:23.055 --> 15:24.923
Crush little spider!

15:24.925 --> 15:26.090
(roars)

15:26.592 --> 15:28.126
(grunts)

15:28.128 --> 15:30.028
(captain america roaring)

15:38.470 --> 15:40.972
I smash.
You give them
their medicine.

15:40.974 --> 15:42.173
Hey!

15:42.175 --> 15:44.676
Been waiting for this.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.212
You won't enjoy it
as much as I will.

15:53.052 --> 15:55.119
Always worry
about hurting people.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.421
Always hold back.

15:57.022 --> 15:58.222
Not now.

15:59.658 --> 16:01.092
Now!

16:01.094 --> 16:01.993
(grunts)

16:02.995 --> 16:04.495
Hulk unleash!

16:08.534 --> 16:09.734
Zap him!

16:10.102 --> 16:11.202
Not me!

16:13.038 --> 16:14.372
(strains)

16:14.707 --> 16:16.207
(screams)

16:18.444 --> 16:19.744
(strains)

16:21.747 --> 16:23.181
(groans)

16:25.217 --> 16:27.151
(all roaring)

16:28.053 --> 16:30.321
Too many.
Need to thin them out.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.090
What were you thinking?

16:32.224 --> 16:33.758
Do you trust me?

16:33.760 --> 16:36.194
Yes?
Then meet me
on the street.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.729
Whoa!

16:38.564 --> 16:40.164
Hulk!

16:42.634 --> 16:44.135
(gasps)

16:44.436 --> 16:45.737
(growls)

16:51.010 --> 16:52.777
(dog barks)
here, flippy!

16:53.178 --> 16:54.779
(grunting)

16:56.148 --> 16:57.615
Take your time, widow.

16:59.618 --> 17:01.085
(elevator bell chimes)

17:01.087 --> 17:03.488
(sighs)
playing with hulks
is fun.

17:04.455 --> 17:06.023
(grunts)

17:11.063 --> 17:13.531
Me falcon gonna crush!

17:15.067 --> 17:17.535
Right, work on that, kid.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.770
(strains)

17:18.771 --> 17:20.471
(growls)

17:24.042 --> 17:24.909
(all grunting)

17:28.146 --> 17:29.580
My turn.

17:32.117 --> 17:33.384
(electricity crackles)

17:33.786 --> 17:35.353
(strains)

17:38.457 --> 17:39.590
(groans)

17:42.127 --> 17:43.594
We're out of time.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.163
They're going full gamma.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.731
(both straining)

17:50.135 --> 17:51.169
(roars)

18:01.513 --> 18:02.580
Ah!

18:03.282 --> 18:04.582
(grunts)

18:05.084 --> 18:07.618
Thor is stronger!

18:07.786 --> 18:10.188
Thor always stronger!

18:10.190 --> 18:12.256
Fall you puny!

18:12.758 --> 18:14.592
Iron man was right.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.793
What?

18:15.795 --> 18:18.229
Said your helmet
looks stupid up-close.

18:18.797 --> 18:20.531
(energy hums)

18:20.799 --> 18:23.234
Be the scientist.
Be tony...

18:23.236 --> 18:24.435
Thor: Stark!

18:24.770 --> 18:28.206
Thor's helmet
accent features perfectly!

18:28.440 --> 18:29.707
Recognize!

18:30.375 --> 18:31.642
(grunts)

18:35.881 --> 18:37.115
Huh?

18:44.590 --> 18:45.857
(grunts)

18:48.660 --> 18:49.827
(thor yells)

19:01.907 --> 19:03.374
(roaring)

19:11.683 --> 19:14.252
Hulk strongest there is!

19:15.254 --> 19:16.354
You saw.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.924
Thor owes me
$5 when he wakes up.

19:30.937 --> 19:34.805
Want to go punch galactus
in the face for desert?

19:34.807 --> 19:36.207
(chuckles)

19:36.209 --> 19:37.775
(both moan)

19:41.947 --> 19:43.648
It failed.

19:44.416 --> 19:46.184
Not unlike his own teammates,

19:46.186 --> 19:49.820
It appears we underestimated
the hulk.

19:50.455 --> 19:53.357
Be assured that
won't happen again.

19:58.964 --> 20:01.899
Walk me through this again,
from the top.

20:02.501 --> 20:03.968
Bad guy's plan foiled.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.570
Heroes save the day.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.271
Classic good conquers evil.

20:07.273 --> 20:10.841
And just how exactly
did you de-power
the hulked-out avengers?

20:13.879 --> 20:17.481
The avengers have
a contingency plan
for this sort of event.

20:17.483 --> 20:20.351
Our resident expert,
he's called the hulk.

20:20.953 --> 20:23.387
Ugh. And the memory drive?

20:23.389 --> 20:24.922
A little destroyed, sir.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.958
An unexpected swim.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.394
That's what you're
putting in the report?

20:32.464 --> 20:33.798
Okay then.

20:36.535 --> 20:39.937
Good work
not blowing up
new york again.

20:39.939 --> 20:42.540
You're not going to tell him
about the device?

20:42.542 --> 20:44.809
We're avengers,
we watch each other's backs.

20:44.811 --> 20:48.379
No matter how big and green
those backs get.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.582
Far as I'm concerned,
this doesn't exist.

20:51.883 --> 20:53.951
No, it exists.

20:54.453 --> 20:58.589
But now someone I trust
will know where I hide it,
just in case.

20:58.890 --> 21:00.324
Need a lift?

21:00.659 --> 21:02.727
My car did get smashed.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.299
(groans)

21:08.301 --> 21:10.034
Do I have a killer headache.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.969
Head?
(stomach rumbles)

21:11.971 --> 21:13.838
My stomach is killing me.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.340
Feels like I ate a horse.

21:16.342 --> 21:18.976
Honestly,
does my helmet
look stupid?

21:18.978 --> 21:22.613
Never realized
what it must be like
to be him every day.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.283
All that rage.
That power.

21:25.550 --> 21:27.785
And we couldn't do anything
to contain it.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.387
He said it before.

21:29.688 --> 21:31.922
Hulk's the strongest one
there is.
