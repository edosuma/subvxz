WEBVTT

00:01.532 --> 00:04.175
ARE YOU TWO DUMMIES
OUT IN THE YARD AGAIN

00:04.175 --> 00:06.037
PLAYING HUMAN WHAC-A-MOLE?

00:06.037 --> 00:09.180
(makes whacking noise)
(makes buzzing noise)

00:09.180 --> 00:12.183
(laughs) I'M DIGGING UP
THAT OLD TIME CAPSULE

00:12.183 --> 00:14.345
WE BURIED FOR TRAV
WHEN HE WAS A BABY.

00:14.345 --> 00:16.447
OHH.
LAME.

00:16.447 --> 00:19.650
I PRESERVED HIS PAST, ELLIE.
IT IS A MOTHER'S GREATEST GIFT.

00:19.650 --> 00:22.323
SO WHEN DO I GET TO OPEN IT?
ON YOUR 18th BIRTHDAY.

00:22.323 --> 00:25.196
I KNOW YOU'RE 19, BUT I FORGOT
ABOUT THE STUPID THING

00:25.196 --> 00:27.298
UNTIL A COUPLE SECONDS AGO.
OH, YEAH.

00:27.298 --> 00:31.132
THAT CAPSULE IS FULL OF STUFF
THAT WE WANTED YOU TO HAVE.
(sniffs)

00:31.132 --> 00:33.804
IT'S GOT OLD PHOTOS, UM,
YOUR TEDDY RUXPIN BEAR...

00:33.804 --> 00:37.037
MY GRANDMOTHER'S ENGAGEMENT
RING, 38 SPECIAL CASSETTES...

00:37.037 --> 00:38.439
I'M ASSUMING
THOSE ARE FROM YOU?

00:38.439 --> 00:41.612
YOU NEED TO CARRY ON
THEIR MESSAGE, BUD.
WHOO.

00:41.612 --> 00:45.176
I'LL DEVOTE MY LIFE TO IT.
LOOK, I JUST NEED TO BORROW
MY LUCKY VISOR OUT OF THERE.

00:45.176 --> 00:48.179
WITH MY GOLF TOURNEY COMING UP,
I NEED SOME CASH FOR EXPENSES.

00:48.179 --> 00:50.621
NOW HOW CAN I GET MONEY
IF I'M NOT LUCKY?

00:50.621 --> 00:52.283
WILD PITCH--HARD WORK?

00:52.283 --> 00:54.325
HARD WORK. (scoffs)

00:54.325 --> 00:57.328
SO WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
START LOOKING?
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL MORNING, BABY.

00:57.328 --> 01:01.061
DUDE!
I REMEMBER IT WAS BY A HEDGE.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.434
HEDGE.

01:03.434 --> 01:05.136
EHH!

01:07.198 --> 01:08.639
(both) AW.

01:08.639 --> 01:10.371
I KNOW THAT "AW."

01:10.371 --> 01:13.374
LOOK HOW CUTE YOU ARE.
I MEAN, YOU TWO SHOULD BE

01:13.374 --> 01:16.707
ON THE COVER OF THIS MENU,
NOT "MAMMA GIATTA."

01:16.707 --> 01:19.650
THAT IS THE MOST RIDICULOUS
ITALIAN STEREOTYPE.

01:21.782 --> 01:23.684
HI, MAMMA GIATTA.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.086
WHY IS SHE STIRRING
THE SAUCE OUTSIDE?

01:26.086 --> 01:29.089
WE'RE ACTUALLY HERE CELEBRATING.
KIRSTEN STILL HAS A COUPLE

01:29.089 --> 01:32.363
MONTHS OF GRAD SCHOOL, BUT SHE
GOT A REALLY GREAT JOB OFFER.

01:32.363 --> 01:33.794
NICE.
WHATEVER.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.766
(singsongy) MY GIRL'S GOT
THE FULL PACKAGE.

01:35.766 --> 01:37.868
TRAV, STOP.
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

01:37.868 --> 01:41.172
HE CAN'T STOP.
HE WAS COOKED IN HER BABY OVEN.

01:41.172 --> 01:43.274
HE WAS.
THEN TO SAVE MYSELF,

01:43.274 --> 01:46.177
I'M GONNA PRETEND TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM NOW.

01:46.177 --> 01:48.108
IREALLY LIKE THIS GIRL.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.882
I MEAN, SURE, YEAH, SOMETIMES
SHE CAN BE A LITTLERACIST.

01:51.882 --> 01:55.216
MOM, PEOPLE FROM TAIWAN
REALLY ARE CALLED "TAIWANESE."

01:55.216 --> 01:56.587
AGREE TO DISAGREE.

01:56.587 --> 01:58.889
YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WRONG.

01:58.889 --> 02:00.651
(both) AGREE TO DISAGREE.

02:00.651 --> 02:02.553
DON'T.

02:02.553 --> 02:04.855
I'M JUST BUMMED. (sighs)
THE JOB'S IN CHICAGO.

02:04.855 --> 02:08.499
I MEAN, I WISH THERE WAS A WAY
TO MAKE HER STAY, BUT... SUCKS.

02:08.499 --> 02:11.702
OH, SWEETIE.
(horn honk)

02:11.702 --> 02:14.905
HOT DAMN, THIS IS GOOD BREAD.

02:15.906 --> 02:17.608
OH, WE'RE BEING SAD?

02:19.610 --> 02:22.873
OKAY. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO GET KIRSTEN

02:22.873 --> 02:25.716
NOT TO TAKE THIS JOB,
SO TRAVIS CAN STAY IN LOVE.

02:25.716 --> 02:27.218
(all slurp)

02:27.218 --> 02:28.649
OH!
(gasps) OH, GOD.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.652
WE COULD GIVE HER A PUPPY
THAT WOULD BLOW UP

02:31.652 --> 02:34.455
IF SHE TOOK IT
ACROSS TOWN LINES.

02:34.455 --> 02:37.157
THAT'S FROM MY NEW SCREENPLAY,
"THE BLOW-UP PUP."

02:37.157 --> 02:38.659
IT'S A PREQUEL TO "SPEED."

02:38.659 --> 02:39.890
IT'S NOT.
OR...

02:39.890 --> 02:42.363
YOU COULD LET TRAV
HANDLE THIS ON HIS OWN.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.865
JELLY BEAN, YOU JUST
SIMULTANEOUSLY UTTERED

02:44.865 --> 02:48.869
THE DUMBEST AND THE SMARTEST
THINGS YOU'VE EVER SAID.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.170
THAT'S HOW I DO.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.204
YOU MAY NOT HAVE WATER
FOR A FEW HOURS.
SUPER.

02:53.204 --> 02:55.706
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
I AM FINALLY TELLING JULES

02:55.706 --> 02:58.509
THAT SHE'S TOO MEDDLESOME
IN TRAVIS'S LIFE.

02:58.509 --> 02:59.850
(whistles)
(mouths word)

02:59.850 --> 03:02.913
NO, NO, NO! YOU'RE STAYING,
BECAUSE, JULES,

03:02.913 --> 03:06.257
WHEN IT COMES TO TRAVIS,
BOBBY'S THE BETTER PARENT.
(gasps)

03:06.257 --> 03:07.958
YEAH, BABY! IT'S BEEN SAID.

03:07.958 --> 03:09.620
I'LL KILL YOU.

03:09.620 --> 03:11.922
BOBBY REALIZES THAT
TRAVIS IS AN ADULT NOW

03:11.922 --> 03:14.465
AND LETS HIM FIND
HIS OWN WAY.

03:14.465 --> 03:17.568
BOBBY COBB'S NUMBER ONE RULE OF
PARENTING--DO NOT GET INVOLVED.

03:17.568 --> 03:21.232
NAME ONE THING THAT I HAVE DONE
TO TRAVIS THAT IS "MEDDLESOME."
YOU WATCH HIM SLEEP.

03:21.232 --> 03:23.534
YOU SCARE
HIS GIRLFRIEND AWAY.
YOU WANT TO LIVE
IN HIS BLOOD.

03:23.534 --> 03:26.877
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? JUST
LET BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO TRAVIS?

03:26.877 --> 03:30.311
ELLIE, YOU MIND
IF I TAKE THIS? YES.
SURE.

03:30.311 --> 03:33.284
(chuckles) CAN I SEE
THAT SHOVEL FOR A SECOND?

03:33.284 --> 03:35.215
HOW DUMB DO I LOOK?

03:35.215 --> 03:37.318
JUST ONE SECOND.
(chuckles)

03:37.318 --> 03:38.819
LET ME SEE THE SHOVEL.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.252
EXCUSE ME. COULD YOU
HAND ME A NAPKIN?

03:41.252 --> 03:44.955
OOH, THANKS, I'M FLATTERED,
BUT... I'M MARRIED.

03:44.955 --> 03:47.898
TOUGH LUCK, BABE.

03:47.898 --> 03:49.760
CAN YOU BELIEVE HER?

03:49.760 --> 03:53.304
HOLD ON. I JUST HAVE TO
TAKE A KNEE FOR A SECOND.

03:53.304 --> 03:56.437
YOU REALLY THINK
SHE WAS HITTING ON YOU?

03:56.437 --> 03:59.340
LADIES DIG MARRIED GUYS.
WE'RE FORBIDDEN FRUIT.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.241
OBSERVE.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.673
OH, LAURIE?
YEAH.

04:02.673 --> 04:04.645
WHAT IF I WAS TO TELL YOU

04:04.645 --> 04:07.247
I HAD AN APPLE IN MY POCKET
FROM LUNCH?

04:07.247 --> 04:09.550
SO WHAT? WHO CARES?
WHAT IF I WAS TO TELL YOU

04:09.550 --> 04:11.952
THIS APPLE WAS SO SPECIAL,
YOU COULDN'T EVEN LOOK AT IT?

04:11.952 --> 04:15.986
WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT IT?
I WANT TO SEE THE APPLE. GIMME.
FORBIDDEN FRUIT.

04:15.986 --> 04:17.988
OH, I DON'T LIKE THIS
AT ALL.

04:17.988 --> 04:19.490
THERE YOU GUYS ARE.

04:19.490 --> 04:21.892
I'M TAKING A DIG BREAK.
WHO'S UP FOR SOME...

04:21.892 --> 04:23.664
(all) PENNY CAN!

04:23.664 --> 04:25.996
THAT WAS ALMOST
AN IN-AND-OUT, BUD.

04:25.996 --> 04:27.998
HEY, WHAT'S THE NEW RULE
ON THAT ONE?

04:27.998 --> 04:29.840
YOU'LL FIND OUT
WHEN IT HAPPENS.
(clink)

04:29.840 --> 04:33.344
THIS GAME IS DUMB,
BUT IT IS SO ADDICTIVE.

04:33.344 --> 04:35.976
(gasps) THAT'S IT!
FORGET ABOUT YOUR LUCKY VISOR.

04:35.976 --> 04:39.910
WE CAN MAKE MONEY SELLING
BOBBY COBB OFFICIAL PENNY CANS.

04:39.910 --> 04:42.983
YEAH, BECAUSE NOBODY CAN
FIND EMPTY PAINT CANS.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.316
THIS COULD WORK.
(grunts)
(clink)

04:45.316 --> 04:46.817
I ALREADY EARNED 600 BUCKS

04:46.817 --> 04:48.819
BY BORROWING IT
FROM ANDY AND JULES.

04:48.819 --> 04:51.662
WE JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE
SEED MONEY. GRAYSON, YOU IN?

04:51.662 --> 04:56.567
MM, LET ME CRUNCH THE NUMBERS.
6, CARRY THE 1. 1, 9, 7.

04:56.567 --> 04:59.029
EQUALS... OH. (chuckles)
1, 9, 8.

04:59.029 --> 05:02.933
AND... NO. IT'S THE WORST
IDEA LAURIE'S EVER HAD,

05:02.933 --> 05:05.536
AND THAT INCLUDES
THE "GAYKE" SHOP.

05:05.536 --> 05:08.579
FIND ME A GAY DUDE
WHO DOESN'T LOVE CAKE.

05:08.579 --> 05:10.541
SORRY, BOBBY. I'M OUT.

05:10.541 --> 05:13.584
AW, THAT REALLY KICKS ASS.

05:13.584 --> 05:15.746
YOU KNOW WHEN SOMETHING
KICKS ASS, IT'S A GOOD THING.

05:15.746 --> 05:18.719
HOW? EVERY TIME I'VE HAD MY ASS
KICKED, IT'S BEEN HORRIBLE.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.721
WE'VE BEEN MISUSING
THAT PHRASE FOR YEARS.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.953
SO ALL AGREED TO CHANGE IT?
ABSOLUTELY.

05:22.953 --> 05:24.955
NO, YOU CAN'T JUST
CHANGE COMMON PHRASES.

05:24.955 --> 05:26.757
OKAY? WORDS HAVE MEANING.

05:26.757 --> 05:29.099
SLAP OUT OF IT
AND PLAY.

05:29.099 --> 05:31.602
MM. I'LL REMEMBER THAT.

05:31.602 --> 05:32.763
OKAY.

05:32.763 --> 05:35.636
OOH, IN-AND-OUT.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.408
(Laurie, Andy, and Bobby)
'STACHE ATTACK!

05:37.408 --> 05:38.409
WHAT?

05:38.409 --> 05:40.411
HOLD STILL.
RULES ARE RULES.

05:40.411 --> 05:42.913
I'M GONNA GO FIND
THAT TIME CAPSULE.

05:42.913 --> 05:45.816
BORROWED A METAL DETECTOR
FROM TOM.

05:45.816 --> 05:48.749
(makes buzzing noise)

05:48.749 --> 05:51.752
HMM. SURPRISINGLY, NOT A ROBOT.
(chuckles)

05:51.752 --> 05:54.054
(dog barking in distance)

05:54.054 --> 05:58.088
WHY DOES HE CARE SO MUCH
ABOUT THAT TIME C--

05:58.088 --> 06:00.791
OH, MY GOD. I KNOW WHY.
DON'T TELL ME.

06:00.791 --> 06:03.964
PLEASE, LET ME FIGURE THIS OUT.
I'M LIKE SHERLOCK HOLMES.
YOU'RE NOT.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.967
REALLY? BECAUSE I FIGURED OUT
WHERE THAT SMELL WAS COMING FROM

06:06.967 --> 06:10.701
IN THE REFRIGERATOR. IT WAS
A BAG OF LIQUIDY LETTUCE.
CLEVER GIRL.

06:10.701 --> 06:15.906
WHY WOULD TRAVIS CARE ABOUT
THE TIME CAPSULE? WHY? HMM.

06:15.906 --> 06:17.408
WHY, WHY, WHY...

06:17.408 --> 06:19.049
THE QUESTION IS... WHY?

06:19.049 --> 06:22.953
MM-HMM.
THIS MAY BE HARDER THAN
THE CASE OF THE STINKY FRIDGE.

06:22.953 --> 06:25.686
OH, MY GOD.
I NEED A CLUE.

06:25.686 --> 06:28.058
(clenches teeth)
I NEED A CLUE.

06:28.058 --> 06:30.561
WHAT IS TRAVIS SAD ABOUT?

06:30.561 --> 06:34.425
KIRSTEN LEAVING.
THE GIRL. GREAT JOB, WATSON.

06:34.425 --> 06:35.926
YEAH.

06:35.926 --> 06:38.068
OKAY, NOW...

06:38.068 --> 06:40.501
NOW?

06:40.501 --> 06:43.003
IS THERE ANYTHING
IN THAT TIME CAPSULE

06:43.003 --> 06:47.077
THAT WOULD MAKE KIRSTEN
WANT TO STAY IN FLORIDA?

06:47.077 --> 06:48.579
THERE'S OLD PHOTOS,

06:48.579 --> 06:51.011
MY GRANDMOTHER'S ENGAGEMENT
RING, 38 SPECIAL CASSETTES...

06:51.011 --> 06:52.983
GO BACK.
OLD PHOTOS.

06:52.983 --> 06:55.045
GO FORWARD.
THE RING?

06:55.045 --> 06:57.718
THE RING. OF COURSE.
IT'S THE RING!

06:57.718 --> 07:02.122
TRAVIS WANTS TO PROPOSE.
YAY! I GOT IT! WOW!

07:02.122 --> 07:06.026
WAIT. NO!NO!

07:06.026 --> 07:08.198
WHAT, "NO! NO!"?

07:08.198 --> 07:09.900
UM, I WAS JUST...

07:09.900 --> 07:12.803
A NEW DANCE I MADE UP.
IT'S CALLED THE NO-NO DANCE.

07:12.803 --> 07:14.805
NO-NO, NO-NO!

07:14.805 --> 07:17.468
NO-NO, NO-NO!

07:17.468 --> 07:19.970
(makes buzzing noise)
NO-NO, NO-NO!

07:19.970 --> 07:21.111
WEIRD. (chuckles)

07:21.111 --> 07:22.813
(chuckles)

07:22.813 --> 07:24.675
UGH.

07:24.675 --> 07:29.620
в™Єв™Єв™Є

07:37.688 --> 07:40.491
STOP DOING MY NO-NO DANCE.

07:40.491 --> 07:42.993
AND FOR THE RECORD,
IT'S LIKE THIS.

07:42.993 --> 07:44.665
NO-NO, NO-NO!

07:44.665 --> 07:47.097
(all) NO-NO, NO-NO!

07:47.097 --> 07:48.939
AND WIPE OFF
THAT STUPID MUSTACHE.

07:48.939 --> 07:51.071
YOU LOOK LIKE
A REALLY GAY FREDDIE MERCURY.

07:51.071 --> 07:54.074
(both, high-pitched voice)
в™Є PENNY CAN в™Є

07:54.074 --> 07:57.678
TRAVIS IS TOO YOUNG TO GET
ENGAGED. I HAVE TO STOP THIS.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.681
YOU JUST HAVE TO STEP BACK
AND LET HIM LIVE HIS LIFE.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.683
I MEAN, WHAT IF
I GO NUTS ON THIS,

08:02.683 --> 08:05.686
AND THEN I BITE MY TONGUE
ABOUT HIS WEIRD HAIRCUT?

08:05.686 --> 08:07.688
IF YOU TELL TRAVIS
HE CAN'T PROPOSE,

08:07.688 --> 08:10.060
HE'S JUST GONNA
GO DO IT ANYWAY.

08:10.060 --> 08:11.992
I HAVE TO STEP BACK, DON'T I?

08:11.992 --> 08:14.825
YEAH, THAT'LL HAPPEN.

08:14.825 --> 08:17.097
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ME?

08:17.097 --> 08:19.600
JULES... I REALLY, REALLY DON'T.
NOT WITH THIS ONE.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.733
YOU CAN'T JUST SIT BACK.
KEEP YOUR CHIN UP, GIRL.
(smack)

08:22.733 --> 08:25.075
(scoffs) I CAN AND I WILL.

08:25.075 --> 08:28.779
I CAN'T AND I WON'T.
(whispers) HELP ME.

08:28.779 --> 08:31.041
"BOBBY COBB,"
RIGHT THERE ON THE CAN.

08:31.041 --> 08:36.146
MAN, MY NAME'S GOT
A LOT OF B's IN IT.
MY NAME DOESN'T HAVE
ANY B's IN IT.

08:36.146 --> 08:38.889
AW. SORRY I BROUGHT IT UP.
IT'S OKAY.

08:38.889 --> 08:41.221
SO FAR, WE'VE SPENT $300
ON CANS AND LABELS,

08:41.221 --> 08:44.895
ANOTHER $100 ON PENNIES...

08:44.895 --> 08:46.757
MAN, BUYING MONEY FELT WEIRD.

08:46.757 --> 08:50.731
I KNOW,BUT YOU GOT TO SPEND
MONEY TO MAKE MONEY, RIGHT?

08:50.731 --> 08:53.734
AH, IT'S A POPULAR SAYING,
SO I BELIEVE IN IT. IT'S LIKE

08:53.734 --> 08:56.036
"LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION."
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL

08:56.036 --> 08:58.869
THAT MEANS, BUT MAN,
I BELIEVE IT TO THE CORE.

08:58.869 --> 09:00.941
HEY, HONEY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING

09:00.941 --> 09:03.774
WHEN THERE'S STILL
PAINT LEFT IN THE CANS?
BAGGING IT UP.

09:03.774 --> 09:06.977
OH.
COULD BE A MONEYMAKER.

09:06.977 --> 09:10.150
NO, NO. THANK YOU,
THOUGH, BOBBY. THANKS.

09:10.150 --> 09:13.083
(beep)
SUZE ORMAN CALLED WITH
ANOTHER HOT INVESTMENT TIP--

09:13.083 --> 09:15.085
BAGS OF...

09:15.085 --> 09:16.086
PAINT.

09:16.086 --> 09:19.189
EXCUSE ME,
DO YOU HAVE THE TIME?

09:19.189 --> 09:22.693
YEAH. IT'S, UH,
"I'M MARRIED" O'CLOCK.

09:22.693 --> 09:24.134
(both) OKAY.

09:24.134 --> 09:25.866
THEY'RE NOT INTO YOU.

09:25.866 --> 09:28.198
YOU DOUBT EVERYONE--BOBBY
AND LAURIE'S PENNY CAN BUSINESS,

09:28.198 --> 09:30.200
JULES STAYING OUT
OF TRAVIS' LIFE.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.843
YOU EVEN DOUBT
MY MAGNETIC SEXUALITY.

09:32.843 --> 09:35.606
I MIGHT DOUBT THOSE THINGS
BECAUSE I'M ASANE PERSON.

09:35.606 --> 09:37.107
MM.

09:37.107 --> 09:39.149
в™Єв™Єв™Є

09:39.149 --> 09:41.151
SORRY, I COULDN'T HEAR YOU.

09:41.151 --> 09:45.816
THE BREASTS SHE WAS PRESSING
INTO MY BACK WERE WAY TOO LOUD.

09:45.816 --> 09:47.117
HERE YOU GO.

09:47.117 --> 09:49.089
UGH!

09:49.089 --> 09:53.664
NEVER REALLY DUG A HOLE BEFORE.
WAIT, WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

09:53.664 --> 09:55.065
THAT IS
YOUR FIRST BLISTER.

09:55.065 --> 09:58.699
WOW. I HAVE NOT
LIVED A HARD LIFE.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.030
(singsongy)
YOU'RE WELCOME.

10:00.030 --> 10:03.874
HEY, MOM, YOU AND DAD GOT
MARRIED YOUNG. DO YOU REGRET IT?

10:03.874 --> 10:06.206
(laughs) YES.
AND THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.338
I MEAN, THAT WAS
THE WORST THING EVER.

10:08.338 --> 10:10.911
IT'S LIKE THROWING
ALL OF YOUR DREAMS

10:10.911 --> 10:13.213
INTO A DUMPSTER
AND THEN JUST POOPING ON THEM.

10:15.846 --> 10:16.847
(whispers) NO.

10:16.847 --> 10:18.789
(sighs) BUT THEN AGAIN...

10:18.789 --> 10:21.091
BECAUSE OF THAT MARRIAGE,
WE GOT YOU. (chuckles)

10:21.091 --> 10:23.253
SO I GUESS ON THE TOPIC

10:23.253 --> 10:25.255
OF GETTING MARRIED YOUNG
LIKE AN IDIOT,

10:25.255 --> 10:29.099
I HAVE NO REAL STRONG FEELINGS
EITHER WAY. YOU KNOW?

10:29.099 --> 10:31.702
I GOT MARRIED AT 16
TO THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

10:31.702 --> 10:34.665
BEST THING I EVER DID.
MM. HEY, TRAV,

10:34.665 --> 10:38.268
DID YOU HAPPEN TO FIND ANY OF
TOM'S BUSINESS IN THOSE HOLES?

10:38.268 --> 10:40.110
LET ME CHECK. NO.

10:40.110 --> 10:43.043
SORRY, TOM. NONE OF
YOUR BUSINESS OVER HERE.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.045
DON'T YOU LOVE HER FIRE?

10:45.045 --> 10:46.076
I GUESS.

10:46.076 --> 10:48.348
I BROUGHT SOME STUFF
FOR YOU TO BURY.

10:48.348 --> 10:51.351
YEAH, THAT'S NOT REALLY
WHAT I'M DOING, DUDE.

10:53.724 --> 10:56.356
OH, YAY! (giggles)

10:56.356 --> 10:58.829
"PENNY CAN WORLD HEADQUARTERS"?

10:58.829 --> 11:02.933
I SPENT THE LAST OF OUR CASH
ON THIS BANNER AND OUR RADIO AD.

11:02.933 --> 11:05.165
BOBBY, I NEED A FAVOR.

11:05.165 --> 11:09.139
RIGHT AFTER I MAKE THIS SHOT.

11:09.139 --> 11:11.802
(clink)

11:11.802 --> 11:14.344
I'M NOT GETTING UP
IN TRAV'S BUSINESS.

11:14.344 --> 11:16.306
COME ON, BOBBY.
I'M SCARED FOR HIM.

11:16.306 --> 11:19.079
IF I STICK MY NOSE IN,
HE'S GONNA RESENT ME FOREVER.

11:19.079 --> 11:22.182
OH, BUT YOU'RE OKAY WITH HIM
RESENTINGMEFOREVER?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.884
I ASK ONE THING.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.256
(sirens wailing)
BOBBY, BOBBY... IT'S ON!

11:26.256 --> 11:29.089
(rock music playing)
(Bobby and Laurie) PENNY CAN!

11:29.089 --> 11:31.391
(Laurie) CALM DOWN.
IT'S NOT THE REAL POLICE.

11:31.391 --> 11:34.394
IT'S THE FUN POLICE,
AND WE'RE BRINGING YOU

11:34.394 --> 11:38.368
THE GREATEST COIN-BASED GAME
SINCE HEADS OR TAILS.

11:38.368 --> 11:39.970
(Bobby, high-pitched voice)
PENNY CAN!

11:39.970 --> 11:41.972
(Laurie) DO YOU LOVE
HAVING A GOOD TIME?

11:41.972 --> 11:43.273
I DO.

11:43.273 --> 11:47.878
THEN CALL 1-855-PEN-E-CAN.
HOLD FOR AN OPERATOR...

11:47.878 --> 11:50.240
(mouthing words)
THEN ASK FOR CAROL.
SAY YOU'RE ORDERING PENNY CAN,

11:50.240 --> 11:52.743
AND NOT ANY WEIGHT LOSS
PRODUCTS OR SEXUAL AIDS,

11:52.743 --> 11:55.445
AND SHE'LL CONTACT US WITH
YOUR ORDER. IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

11:55.445 --> 11:59.249
(both) ASK FOR CAROL,
NO SEX STUFF, PENNY CAN!

11:59.249 --> 12:03.193
OOH! (hisses) THEY GIVE OUT
AWARDS FOR RADIO ADS, RIGHT?

12:03.193 --> 12:06.256
WELL, THEY BETTER. WE WORKED
ON THIS FOR WELL OVER AN HOUR.

12:06.256 --> 12:09.499
NOW WE JUST WAIT
FOR THE PHONE TO RING.

12:09.499 --> 12:12.933
(telephone rings)
OOH!

12:12.933 --> 12:14.134
HORRIBLE.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.106
WELL, I HOPE THIS WORKS.

12:16.106 --> 12:19.139
IF I LOSE ALL MY MONEY,
I AM SUNK.

12:21.211 --> 12:24.144
WHAT IF THIS
WASN'T A GOOD IDEA?

12:24.144 --> 12:25.846
"IF." (chuckles)

12:25.846 --> 12:29.519
THERE WERE SO MANY BETTER WAYS
FOR BOBBY TO SPEND THAT MONEY.

12:29.519 --> 12:31.952
I MEAN, HE COULD HAVE, SAY,

12:31.952 --> 12:34.424
PUT IT ALL IN A PILE
AND SET IT ON FIRE.
YOU DIDN'T LET HIM DOWN.

12:34.424 --> 12:38.328
IF I DID, IT WOULD
KICK MAJOR ASS.

12:38.328 --> 12:40.430
NO, IT WOULDN'T...

12:40.430 --> 12:42.132
(sighs)

12:42.132 --> 12:43.163
(towel thuds)

12:43.163 --> 12:44.534
UGH.

12:44.534 --> 12:47.037
HEY, DOUBTFIRE.

12:47.037 --> 12:49.169
THINK THAT WAS
REALLY HELPFUL?

12:49.169 --> 12:51.171
HONESTLY, YES.
YOU GUYS ARE LUCKY

12:51.171 --> 12:54.174
TO HAVE ONE REALIST IN THE GROUP
WHO TELLS YOU HOW IT IS.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.476
OH, AND I'LL PROVE IT.
PARDON ME.
YEAH.

12:56.476 --> 12:59.479
EARLIER, DID YOU REALLY NEED
THE TIME, OR WERE YOU LOOKING

12:59.479 --> 13:04.184
TO GET NAKED AND HAVE
A OPEN-FACED CUBAN SEX SANDWICH?

13:04.184 --> 13:06.416
WHAT'D YOU SAY TO MY WIFE?

13:06.416 --> 13:10.190
WHOA. (chuckles)
ARE YOU JUST ONE GUY?

13:10.190 --> 13:11.421
GET IN THE CAR!

13:11.421 --> 13:13.894
I FEEL LIKE I'M ON A COP SHOW!

13:13.894 --> 13:15.495
(grunts)

13:15.495 --> 13:16.867
OOH!

13:16.867 --> 13:18.028
(speaks indistinctly)

13:18.028 --> 13:19.329
(car door slams)

13:19.329 --> 13:21.331
(whimpers)

13:21.331 --> 13:24.274
AW, I LEFT MY KEYS
IN THE BAR.

13:24.274 --> 13:26.376
(babbles)

13:26.376 --> 13:29.239
(slap)
STOP IT.
YOU'LL JUST MAKE HIM ANGRIER.

13:29.239 --> 13:30.380
D'OH! OH, GOD.

13:30.380 --> 13:32.382
HEY, COME ON,
OPEN THE DOOR.

13:32.382 --> 13:34.084
UH, I-I...

13:38.118 --> 13:40.420
AW. KIND OF LIKED YOU
WITH A MUSTACHE.

13:40.420 --> 13:44.224
SAD PART IS, I COULD
ACTUALLY MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
HMM. YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE SHAVE, TOO.

13:44.224 --> 13:47.227
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
HAVE FUN DIGGING.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.229
LOOK AT YOU STEPPING BACK.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.301
I SAY WE CELEBRATE ME.

13:51.301 --> 13:53.904
YOU DESERVE IT.
IMAGINARY HAT...

13:53.904 --> 13:55.405
IMAGINARY HOOK HANDS.

13:55.405 --> 13:58.568
(makes clicking noise)
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.

13:58.568 --> 14:00.310
NO ONE EVER DOES.

14:00.310 --> 14:04.044
WELL, I SWEAR I DID NOT
SAY ONE WORD TO TRAVIS.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.345
I JUST LET HIM...

14:05.345 --> 14:07.147
BE.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.518
MM-HMM.

14:08.518 --> 14:11.521
JUST REMEMBER TO STICK WITH THAT
WHEN HE FINDS THE CAPSULE.

14:11.521 --> 14:14.024
OH, HE'LL NEVER FIND IT,

14:14.024 --> 14:17.027
BECAUSE I ALREADY FOUND IT,
AND I HID IT IN MY CLOSET.

14:17.027 --> 14:19.990
PEOPLE REALLY SHOULD
CALL ME JULES SHERLOCK.

14:19.990 --> 14:21.491
SHERLOCK WAS HIS FIRST NAME.

14:21.491 --> 14:24.434
I AGREE TO DISAGREE.
CHEERS.
NO.

14:24.434 --> 14:27.467
OH, COME ON, WATSON.
MNH-MNH.

14:35.545 --> 14:38.548
HOW COME HE DIDN'T SEE YOU WHEN
YOU DUG UP THE TIME CAPSULE?

14:38.548 --> 14:41.181
'CAUSE I PUT SOME COUGH SYRUP
IN HIS LEMONADE.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.553
HE FELL ASLEEP IN A HOLE.

14:43.553 --> 14:45.255
YOU KNOW, OUT OF CONTEXT,

14:45.255 --> 14:47.387
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A HORRIBLE ABDUCTION STORY.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.059
(both) AGREE TO DISAGREE.

14:49.059 --> 14:51.661
STOP DOING THAT!
YOU ARE BUGGING ME!

14:51.661 --> 14:54.594
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

14:54.594 --> 14:59.229
I NEITHER TOLD HIM WHAT TO DO
NOR WHAT NOT TO DO.

14:59.229 --> 15:01.972
EXCUSE ME. VICTORY SIP.

15:01.972 --> 15:05.505
MM. (gargles)

15:05.505 --> 15:07.237
I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT.

15:07.237 --> 15:09.940
THE CLINGY MOM ACT?
IT'S NOT CUTE ANYMORE.

15:09.940 --> 15:12.242
IN FACT, IT'S UGLY ON YOU,
JUST LIKE SCARVES.

15:12.242 --> 15:14.084
I LOOK BAD IN SCARVES?

15:14.084 --> 15:16.286
THEY GIVE YOU BIRD FACE.

15:16.286 --> 15:19.289
I'M NOT GONNA SIT HERE
AND BE JUDGED BY SOMEONE

15:19.289 --> 15:22.292
WHO DOESN'T HAVE A 19-YEAR-OLD,
AND MOST OF ALL,

15:22.292 --> 15:25.425
WHO THINKS THERE'S A GHOST
IN HER PICKUP TRUCK.

15:25.425 --> 15:30.961
THEN... WHO KEEPS MOVING
MY SUNGLASSES, JULES? WHO?

15:30.961 --> 15:32.262
HMM!

15:32.262 --> 15:34.965
HMM!

15:34.965 --> 15:38.138
(grunts) COME ON. REALLY,
I JUST WANNA TALK TO YOU.

15:38.138 --> 15:42.242
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS GUY
EATS FOR BREAKFAST? A GOAT?
I'M A NICE GUY.

15:42.242 --> 15:45.015
DON'T BE AFRAID.
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.
YOU KNOW THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT?
YEAH, WHY WON'T YOU JUST ADMIT

15:45.015 --> 15:47.217
THAT THOSE WOMEN
WEREN'T HITTING ON YOU?

15:47.217 --> 15:50.620
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.
MAYBE SOME OF 'EM WEREN'T,
BUT WHY WON'T YOU JUST LET ME

15:50.620 --> 15:53.323
HAVE IT? THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO DO FOR FRIENDS...
(grunting)

15:53.323 --> 15:57.257
BELIEVE IN THEM NO MATTER WHAT.
IT'S WHAT I DO, ANYWAY.
(slapping leg)

15:57.257 --> 15:58.558
(chuckles and grunts)

15:58.558 --> 16:00.260
THAT'S TWO.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.962
MM.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.535
I THINK HE LEFT.

16:05.535 --> 16:07.237
I WARNED YOU! (groaning)

16:07.237 --> 16:09.239
NOPE, UH, HE'S LIFTING US.
WOW.

16:09.239 --> 16:10.240
OH.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.372
GET OFF!
WHAT IS HE, THE HULK?

16:12.372 --> 16:15.375
HEY, WHY IS YOUR CAR
UPSIDE-DOWN IN THE PARKING LOT?

16:15.375 --> 16:17.077
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.649
I CALLED YOU HERE BECAUSE
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

16:19.649 --> 16:23.083
HOW IS THAT GONNA
GET PEOPLE TO BUY PENNY CAN?

16:23.083 --> 16:25.385
OOH, THAT MIGHT WORK.
CAN I HAVE ONE NOW?
NOPE.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.617
(indistinct conversations,
clink)

16:27.617 --> 16:29.189
PENNY CAN!

16:29.189 --> 16:31.321
(man) в™Є COME AROUND в™Є

16:31.321 --> 16:33.323
(bell clangs)

16:33.323 --> 16:35.325
OKAY, FOLKS!

16:35.325 --> 16:38.328
FIRST WE'D LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL
FOR COMING TO PENNY CAN NIGHT.

16:38.328 --> 16:40.330
(cheers)
YEAH! (whistling)

16:40.330 --> 16:42.632
THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RULES.

16:42.632 --> 16:44.634
UM, "CAN I USE A NICKEL?"
(chuckles)

16:44.634 --> 16:47.337
SERIOUSLY? IT'S CALLED,
"PENNY CAN," PEOPLE.

16:47.337 --> 16:49.639
OKAY, UH,
"CAN I THROW UNDERHAND?"

16:49.639 --> 16:52.342
I MEAN, SURE, YOU CAN,
IF YOU DON'T MIND LOOKING

16:52.342 --> 16:55.545
LIKE A SISSY MAN, AND I'M
TALKING TO YOU, STEVE. OKAY?
OH.

16:55.545 --> 16:58.288
IF ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO BUY
THEIR VERY OWN PENNY CAN,

16:58.288 --> 17:02.222
WE HAVE THEM FOR SALE,
ONE FOR $19.95, 2 FOR $50.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.354
THAT'S A HORRIBLE DEAL.

17:04.354 --> 17:08.728
BOBBY AND I WILL BE ON MUSTACHE
PATROL FOR ANY INS-AND-OUTS.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.301
'STACHE ATTACK!
SORRY, BUDDY.

17:11.301 --> 17:15.405
IN THIS SITUATION, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO GIVE YOU CRAZY BROWS.

17:15.405 --> 17:18.268
IT WAS REALLY NICE OF YOU
TO DO THIS FOR BOBBY AND LAURIE.

17:18.268 --> 17:21.271
I ALSO REALLY WANTED YOU
TO KNOW THAT I BELIEVE IN YOU

17:21.271 --> 17:25.215
WHEN IT COMES TO ALL THIS
TRAVIS STUFF, BECAUSE--
YEAH, YEAH, WHATEVER.
I FIXED IT. IT'S OVER.

17:25.215 --> 17:28.448
(clink)
I CANNOT HIT A THING.
SLAP OUT OF IT, ANDY.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.280
EXCUSE ME.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.082
(clink)
(Andy groans)

17:32.082 --> 17:33.583
(slap)
(groans)

17:33.583 --> 17:36.556
NOW WE'RE EVEN.
OH.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.258
(squeals)

17:38.258 --> 17:43.062
OKAY, WOW, GUYS,
LET'S GET ANOTHER GAME GOING!

17:43.062 --> 17:46.336
WATCH AND LEARN, PEOPLE!

17:46.336 --> 17:47.637
(clank)
(man) OOH.

17:47.637 --> 17:50.069
DRANO.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.242
(all, high-pitched voice)
MOVING TARGET PENNY CAN!

17:52.242 --> 17:54.344
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

17:54.344 --> 17:57.347
YOU, COME WITH ME.

17:57.347 --> 17:59.649
(panting)
WHY ARE YOU SO WINDED?
OH, MY GOD.

17:59.649 --> 18:02.712
DON'T TELL ME YOU WALKED HERE
BECAUSE OF YOUR TRUCK GHOST.

18:02.712 --> 18:06.456
I PARKED IN THE STREET,
AND IT'S IN MY DRIVEWAY NOW.

18:06.456 --> 18:09.389
(beep, speed-dialing)
LOOK. I JUST WANTED YOU
TO HEAR SOMETHING.

18:09.389 --> 18:12.192
MOM? HI!

18:12.192 --> 18:14.194
YOU COULDN'T WAIT
THREE SECONDS

18:14.194 --> 18:16.496
TO TELL ME
YOU'RE TOO BUSY TO TALK?

18:16.496 --> 18:18.698
I'M YOURDAUGHTER.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.670
GO TO HELL!
(beep)

18:20.670 --> 18:21.801
ELLIE!

18:21.801 --> 18:23.803
IT'S OKAY.
I DIDN'T REALLY CALL HER,

18:23.803 --> 18:26.306
BUT THAT'S WHAT
IT WOULD HAVE SOUNDED LIKE

18:26.306 --> 18:28.438
IF I COULD STAND
THE SOUND OF HER VOICE.

18:28.438 --> 18:31.441
IT'S ONE THING TO BE
TOO INVOLVED IN YOUR KID'S LIFE

18:31.441 --> 18:34.144
WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG.
YOU HAVE TO PROTECT THEM.

18:34.144 --> 18:37.147
BUT WITH MY MOM, THE ENDLESS
OPINIONS AND THE PICKING--

18:37.147 --> 18:40.150
IT NEVER STOPPED. IT JUST FELT
LIKE SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN ME.

18:40.150 --> 18:42.792
I HATED HER FOR THAT,
AND I STILL DO.

18:42.792 --> 18:45.825
I JUST DON'T WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN TO YOU AND TRAVIS.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.828
(man) в™Є FOR EVERY FLOWER
THAT WE TRY TO GROW в™Є

18:48.828 --> 18:53.163
GUYS. WE MADE ENOUGH MONEY
FOR BOBBY TO BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
