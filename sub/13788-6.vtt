WEBVTT

00:06.137 --> 00:09.009
NO, ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
MIND ME BEING OVER SO MUCH?

00:09.009 --> 00:10.611
NOT ONE SMIDGE.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.243
KARL, YOU'RE WELCOME
HERE ANY TIME.

00:12.243 --> 00:13.584
DR. JAMES FEELS THE SAME WAY.

00:13.584 --> 00:15.716
DON'T YOU, DEAR?
OF COURSE HE DOES.
UH...

00:16.717 --> 00:18.719
I WAS JUST CONCERNED
YOU'D BE BUSY--

00:18.719 --> 00:21.292
A MAN OF YOUR PROMINENCE
IN THE PSYCHOLOGY FIELD.

00:21.292 --> 00:23.494
HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE A SYNDROME
NAMED AFTER YOU YET?

00:23.494 --> 00:26.527
A MILD DISORDER--
AN IRRITATING TWITCH, PERHAPS.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.330
WELL, I DID HAVE A PATIENT

00:29.330 --> 00:31.732
WITH A SERIOUS CASE
OF "THE BENNETTS,"

00:31.732 --> 00:33.704
AS I CALLED IT. IF--

00:33.704 --> 00:35.236
BUT IT DIDN'T CATCH ON.

00:36.467 --> 00:38.709
OF COURSE YOU ARE WELCOME
HERE ANY TIME, KARL.

00:38.709 --> 00:40.641
OH, THAT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.714
MOTHER'S TRAINING 24/7
FOR THE STRONG WOMAN
COMPETITION,

00:43.714 --> 00:45.716
AND FATHER'S STILL
UP IN THE SPACE STATION,

00:45.716 --> 00:48.048
SO I'M RATHER LONELY.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.351
COULD THAT BE "THE BENNETTS"?

00:51.652 --> 00:55.086
KARL, WE'RE NEIGHBORS.
WHENEVER YOU NEED SOME COMPANY

00:55.086 --> 00:57.228
OR A NICE, HOME-COOKED MEAL--
( clears throat )

00:57.228 --> 00:59.360
OKAY--A MEAL,

00:59.360 --> 01:00.761
YOU JUST KNOCK ON OUR DOOR.

01:00.761 --> 01:04.435
THANK YOU.
OH, WHAT LOVELY FLOWERS.

01:04.435 --> 01:06.367
NOW, WHERE DID THEY COME FROM?

01:06.367 --> 01:08.769
YEAH. I FORGOT
TO TELL YOU, ELLEN.

01:08.769 --> 01:11.372
YOU GOT A DELIVERY
FROM WALTER PERKINS

01:11.372 --> 01:12.373
AGAIN.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.704
WHO'S WALTER PERKINS?

01:13.704 --> 01:16.847
ELLEN HAS A SECRET ADMIRER
WHO KEEPS SENDING HER THINGS.

01:16.847 --> 01:18.479
IT'S REALLY NOT APPROPRIATE.

01:18.479 --> 01:21.152
YOGURT-DIPPED STRAWBERRIES,
GOURMET HONEY,

01:21.152 --> 01:22.513
ARTISAN CHEESE HAMPER--

01:22.513 --> 01:25.286
IT'S REALLY NOT APPROPRIATE.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.588
YOGURT-DIPPED STRAWBERRIES
ARE TASTY.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.320
THEY WERE LUSCIOUS.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.722
SO TERRIBLY INAPPROPRIATE.

01:32.723 --> 01:35.526
MRS. JENNINGS,
YOU ARE A CAUTION.

01:35.526 --> 01:36.527
OH.
( chuckling )

01:36.527 --> 01:38.669
( murmuring indistinctly )

01:38.669 --> 01:40.771
Karl: YOU MAKE TEATIME
A TRUE DELIGHT.

01:40.771 --> 01:43.274
WHY DOES HE TALK LIKE
HE'S A HUNDRED-YEAR-OLD

01:43.274 --> 01:45.476
BRITISH SOCIETY LADY?

01:45.476 --> 01:46.637
( in high-pitched
British accent )
HELLO,

01:46.637 --> 01:48.579
I'M A BRITISH
SOCIETY LA--

01:48.579 --> 01:50.611
( coughing )

01:50.611 --> 01:52.613
MAN, THAT'S HARD.

01:54.785 --> 01:55.816
IS KARL STILL HERE?

01:55.816 --> 01:58.749
YEP. HE'S BEEN HANGING
AROUND HERE ALL DAY.

01:58.749 --> 02:01.322
HE'S GOT MOM AND DAD
COMPLETELY CONNED.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.624
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE'S LIKE--ALWAYS PRANKING US.

02:07.658 --> 02:09.730
"PULL IF YOU'RE COOL."

02:09.730 --> 02:11.732
( chuckles )
OH, YEAH.

02:16.667 --> 02:18.769
VERY COOL.

02:18.769 --> 02:20.171
KARL!

02:24.915 --> 02:26.247
HOW DELIGHTFUL--

02:26.247 --> 02:28.819
YOU HAVE TO BE RESCUED
FROM A LIFE RAFT.

02:28.819 --> 02:31.222
( laughing )

02:31.222 --> 02:33.424
WISH HE WOULD LEAVE
SO I COULD WATCH TV.

02:33.424 --> 02:35.526
CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF
IS ON.

02:35.526 --> 02:36.657
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT,

02:36.657 --> 02:39.730
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GOT
AT LEAST ONE GOOD SCENE.

02:39.730 --> 02:41.462
BUT I'M STUCK
HERE IN THE KITCHEN!

02:42.463 --> 02:44.635
I JUST HEARD A STRANGE VOICE.

02:44.635 --> 02:47.468
WHO SAID, "I'M STUCK
HERE IN THE KITCHEN"?

02:47.468 --> 02:48.839
OH, UH, I DID.

02:48.839 --> 02:51.242
SOMETIMES, WHEN I'M STUCK
HERE IN THE KITCHEN,

02:51.242 --> 02:53.744
IT MAKES ME SO MAD
MY VOICE DROPS THREE OCTAVES.

02:53.744 --> 02:55.746
( deep voice )
I'M STUCK HERE
IN THE KITCHEN!

02:57.748 --> 02:59.280
SO TELL ME
ABOUT THOSE FLOWERS.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.611
AREN'T THEY LOVELY?

03:00.611 --> 03:02.383
THEY'RE FOUR YOUR MOTHER
FROM A WALTER PERKINS.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.315
YOU DO KNOW THERE ARE THREE
DOORS IN THIS KITCHEN

03:04.315 --> 03:05.686
PROVIDING MEANS OF EGRESS?

03:07.388 --> 03:09.860
YOU THINK YOU'RE
SO MUCH SMARTER THAN US
WITH YOUR FANCY WORDS

03:09.860 --> 03:11.792
BUT REALLY YOU'RE ONLY
SMARTER THAN ME.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.626

03:17.698 --> 03:20.231

KNOW HOW CLOSE THAT WAS?

03:20.231 --> 03:22.803

STAN'S SECRET.

03:26.877 --> 03:28.679

I CAN'T TAKE THE PRESSURE

03:28.679 --> 03:30.341
OF KEEPING THAT SECRET
ANYMORE.

03:30.341 --> 03:32.243

WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT.

IN THAT CASE, I ONLY

03:43.354 --> 03:44.355

SMELLS SO FUNNY.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.832
THAT'S NOT THE POINT
OF THE STORY.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.864
KARL ALMOST
HEARD STAN TALK.

09:45.616 --> 09:47.818
FROM GRANDMA
AND YOUR ALLOWANCE?

09:47.818 --> 09:49.860
IT WAS WORTH IT
TO SEE YOU SO HAPPY.

09:49.860 --> 09:52.292
OH, IT IS SO SWEET.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.895
IT'S AS SWEET
AS JELLIES OR PRESERVES--

09:54.895 --> 09:56.967
WHATEVER'S SWEETER--
I DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

09:57.968 --> 09:59.670
KARL, ISN'T THAT

09:59.670 --> 10:01.702
JUST SO NICE OF CHLOE?

10:01.702 --> 10:03.603
SO NICE.

10:05.175 --> 10:08.879
CHLOE, WHY DID YOU
SAY IT WAS FROM WALTER PERKINS?

10:08.879 --> 10:10.140
WHO KNOWS WHY KIDS
DO THINGS.

10:10.140 --> 10:12.382
WE'RE HIGH-SPIRITED
AND WHIMSICAL.

10:13.884 --> 10:15.215
IT'S JUST SO THOUGHTFUL.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.047
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

10:17.047 --> 10:18.088
KARL,

10:18.088 --> 10:19.990
ISN'T THAT SO THOUGHTFUL
OF CHLOE?

10:19.990 --> 10:22.122
SO THOUGHTFUL.

10:23.854 --> 10:25.726
WELL, I'M JUST GLAD
WE FINALLY KNOW

10:25.726 --> 10:27.798
WHO THE REAL
WALTER PERKINS IS.

10:27.798 --> 10:29.259
YEP. MYSTERY SOLVED.
( chuckles )

10:29.259 --> 10:31.201
WELL, I'LL JUST GO
PUT THESE AWAY IN THE KITCHEN.

10:31.201 --> 10:32.663
OH, I'LL HELP.

10:32.663 --> 10:35.305
( breathing rapidly )

10:35.305 --> 10:37.868
WE'LL ALL HELP.

10:39.770 --> 10:41.742
LOOK WHAT STAN
DID TO YOUR PILLOW.

10:44.214 --> 10:47.217
YOU TWO ARE DESPICABLE!

10:47.217 --> 10:48.378
WHAT DID WE DO?

10:48.378 --> 10:50.951
YOU STOLE CREDIT
FOR MY GIFTS.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.754
I'M WALTER PERKINS,
AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.125
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS

10:55.125 --> 10:57.087
WHEN YOU PUT A RAFT
IN SOMEONE'S BACKPACK.

10:57.087 --> 11:00.060
WELL IT'S NOT ALWAYS
WHAT HAPPENS--BUT IT'S
WHAT CAN HAPPEN.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.261
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

11:01.261 --> 11:03.163
HOW DID CHLOE KNOW
WHAT WAS ON THAT CARD?

11:03.163 --> 11:05.265
TYLER TOLD HER.
HE'S PSYCHIC.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.037
I KNEW SHE WAS
GONNA SAY THAT.

11:07.037 --> 11:08.098
THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS!

11:08.098 --> 11:09.700
HE CAN'T EVEN
READ HIS OWN MIND.

11:11.041 --> 11:12.372
I KNEW YOU
WERE GONNA SAY THAT.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.444
IT'S WHY I LOOKED HURT
RIGHT BEFORE YOU SAID IT.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.978
FINE. DON'T TELL ME
HOW SHE KNEW.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.751
BUT I'M GONNA FIGURE THIS OUT
AND SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.

11:20.751 --> 11:22.152
AND WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

11:22.152 --> 11:24.985
TELL OUR PARENTS
THAT YOU'RE WALTER PERKINS?

11:24.985 --> 11:26.917
IT'LL LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
TRYING TO TAKE CREDIT

11:26.917 --> 11:29.259
FROM THEIR SWEET,
LOVING ANGEL.

11:29.259 --> 11:32.362
BUT I'M THE SWEET,
LOVING ANGEL.

11:33.263 --> 11:34.725
NOT ANYMORE.

11:34.725 --> 11:37.297
YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS.
YOU'LL ALL PAY FOR THIS!

11:37.297 --> 11:39.369
THOUGH FIRST, YOU'LL PAY
FOR THE JAMS AND JELLIES.

11:39.369 --> 11:40.831
WE'RE ASSUMING NO TIP.

11:40.831 --> 11:42.332
CO-RRECT!

11:43.203 --> 11:45.005
AND THEN YOU'LL
PAY METAPHORICALLY,

11:45.005 --> 11:48.038
OR MY NAME ISN'T
KARL L. FINK!

11:48.038 --> 11:49.880
I'LL PUT RAFTS
IN ALL YOUR BACKPACKS.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.311
I'LL "RAFT-PACK" ALL OF YOU.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.814
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.788
DIDN'T HE JUST TELL US
EXACTLY WHAT HE'S CAPABLE OF?

12:02.122 --> 12:04.724
IN JAM,
THE FRUIT IS CRUSHED

12:04.724 --> 12:06.056
OR IN PULP FORM.

12:06.056 --> 12:08.058
Others: AHH...

12:09.299 --> 12:11.031
KNOCKEDY-KNOCKEDY.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.132
OH, HELLO, KARL.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.503
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?
( door shuts )

12:13.503 --> 12:15.936
WELL, I HAVE
MY AFTERNOON FREE.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.208
MOTHER'S OUT OF TOWN.
SHE WAS PULLING AN AIRPLANE

12:18.208 --> 12:20.370
WITH HER TEETH WHEN IT
UNEXPECTEDLY TOOK OFF.

12:20.370 --> 12:22.943
SHE TRIED TO HOLD ON
TILL PHOENIX, BUT HER JAW
GAVE OUT.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.215
THANK GOODNESS
FOR LAKE HAVASU.

12:25.215 --> 12:26.276
( doorbell rings )

12:26.276 --> 12:28.518
AND NOW THEY'RE
TAKING SUNDAYS!

12:30.280 --> 12:33.283
THANK YOU.
AH, CHLOE.

12:33.283 --> 12:36.156
ANOTHER GIFT
FROM WALTER PERKINS?

12:36.156 --> 12:38.028
SWEETIE, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO DO THIS ANYMORE.

12:38.028 --> 12:39.759
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.361
SHH!

12:41.361 --> 12:42.462
IT'S ALL PART OF THE PLAN.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.965
THIS IS WHAT WE
WANTED HIM TO DO.
JUST PLAY ALONG.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.066
( Karl sighs )

12:46.066 --> 12:47.767
I GUESS LITTLE RED
JUST CAN'T HELP

12:47.767 --> 12:50.300
BEING SUCH A SWEET,
GENEROUS ANGEL.

12:51.371 --> 12:54.304

12:56.376 --> 12:58.148
OH! OH! OH, NO!

12:58.148 --> 12:59.980
OH, NO!
WHAT DO I DO?

12:59.980 --> 13:01.281
HOW DO I GET OUT OF THIS?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

13:01.281 --> 13:03.083
( screams )

13:05.355 --> 13:06.286
( chuckling )

13:06.286 --> 13:07.818
ELLEN, ARE YOU OKAY?

13:07.818 --> 13:09.019
ARE YOU LAUGHING?

13:09.019 --> 13:10.560
OH, JUST RELIEVED
THAT YOU'RE NOT HURT.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.262
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.997
CHLOE, WHY WOULD YOU
DO SUCH A THING?

13:16.997 --> 13:19.870
YES, CHLOE,
WHY WOULD YOU?

13:19.870 --> 13:21.031
I WOULDN'T!

13:21.031 --> 13:22.833
AND SHE DIDN'T.

13:23.934 --> 13:25.275
KARL DID!

13:25.275 --> 13:26.406
WHAT?!

13:26.406 --> 13:28.808
KARL FINK IS THE REAL
WALTER PERKINS

13:28.808 --> 13:30.080
AND HAS BEEN ALL ALONG.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.341
LIES. ALL LIES.

13:31.341 --> 13:32.412
I AM NOT WALTER PERKINS

13:32.412 --> 13:34.044
AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN!

13:34.044 --> 13:36.186
( beeping )
Karl ( on recording ):
I'M WALTER PERKINS,

13:36.186 --> 13:37.317
AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN!

13:38.348 --> 13:39.920
LIES THAT ARE BEGINNING
TO APPEAR

13:39.920 --> 13:41.121
TO HAVE SOMETHING TO THEM.

13:42.392 --> 13:45.025
KARL, I'M SO DISAPPOINTED.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.026
NO--BUT-- ( stammering )
I WOULDN'T.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.497
I-I DIDN'T.

13:47.497 --> 13:49.299
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.533
CHLOE, WHY DID YOU
PRETEND TO BE WALTER PERKINS?

13:53.533 --> 13:56.466
KARL GOT MOMMY WET.
YOU LAUGHED AT HER.

13:56.466 --> 13:58.138
WHY AM I THE BAD GUY?

ON MY HONOR,
KARL L. FINK

KARL, T-THIS
IS JUST TOO MUCH.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.349
I THINK YOU SHOULD
GO HOME.

14:11.481 --> 14:13.483

14:16.226 --> 14:18.528
I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION--
IT'S "LESLIE."

14:18.528 --> 14:19.529
MMM.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.897
OKAY. WE GOT KARL.

14:26.897 --> 14:29.439
THE QUESTION IS...
"WHAT'S HIS NEXT MOVE
GONNA BE?"

14:29.439 --> 14:31.942
HE IS GOOD.
HE'S VERY GOOD.

14:31.942 --> 14:34.204

A GRAMMAR LESSON NOW?

I KNOW KARL'S UP TO SOMETHING.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.611
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT.

14:41.611 --> 14:44.614
EXCUSE ME.
I USUALLY TAKE THE LEAD
IN THESE THINGS.

14:44.614 --> 14:46.556
SORRY. I WAS JUST TRYING
TO KEEP IT MOVING.

14:47.958 --> 14:49.289
ANYWAY,

14:49.289 --> 14:52.262
KARL IS UP TO SOMETHING
AND WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT.

14:52.262 --> 14:53.323
YEAH.

14:55.165 --> 14:57.297
RIGHT. I'M GOIN' IN.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.569
IF I DON'T COME BACK,
TELL MY FAKE WIFE

I FAKE LOVE HER.

CLEVER AND COMPLEX
AS THEY ARE.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.659
FATHER IN GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT,

15:29.659 --> 15:31.361
AND MOTHER LEAPING HOME

15:37.237 --> 15:39.039
WHAT DOESN'T KILL YA
MAKES YA...

15:39.039 --> 15:40.240
WEIRDER.

15:41.471 --> 15:43.643
THE THING IS...
ELLEN AND DR. JAMES

15:43.643 --> 15:45.075
ARE REALLY NICE TO ME.

AND BICKER ALL THE TIME,

I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE KARL FINK

15:56.286 --> 15:58.628
BELONGS IN A SHED
BY HIMSELF.

15:58.628 --> 16:01.461
MAYBE KARL FINK IS DESTINED
FOR A LIFE AS A LONER.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.264
MAYBE KARL FINK REFERRING
TO HIMSELF AS "KARL FINK"

16:04.264 --> 16:06.136
IS A LARGE PART
OF THE REASON WHY.

16:10.500 --> 16:11.971
I MISS WALTER PERKINS.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.603
EVERYTHING TASTES BETTER
FROM A BASKET.

16:13.603 --> 16:17.007
STUPID STORE-BOUGHT APPLE!

16:17.007 --> 16:19.049
KARL'S NOT UP TO ANYTHING.

16:19.049 --> 16:21.011
HE'S TOTALLY GIVEN UP.

16:21.011 --> 16:22.352
OH, PLEASE.

16:22.352 --> 16:23.653
HE HAS NOT GIVEN UP.

16:23.653 --> 16:24.984
HE'S JUST WEAK.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.517
HE FEEDS ON MISERY
AND THE TEARS OF THE INNOCENT,

16:27.517 --> 16:30.490
AND WE SHUT DOWN
HIS BUFFET.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.992
SORRY. I'VE BEEN SPENDING
TOO MUCH TIME AROUND KARL.

16:34.224 --> 16:36.396
NO. HE REALLY
FEELS ALONE AND DOWN.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.268
HIS CONNECTION TO THIS FAMILY

16:38.268 --> 16:40.300
MEANS MORE
THAN YOU ALL REALIZE.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.532
THIS IS KARL
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

16:42.532 --> 16:46.106
HE MADE ME EXPLODE WATER
IN MOMMY'S FACE.

16:46.106 --> 16:49.339
I MEAN, HE EXPLODED WATER
IN MOMMY'S FACE.

16:49.339 --> 16:52.642
HE CONFUSES LITTLE GIRLS!

16:52.642 --> 16:56.246
I'M JUST LUCKY THAT
BACKPACK DIDN'T INFLATE
INSIDE MY SHIRT.

WHY WOULD IT BE
INSIDE YOUR SHIRT?

REALLY? WE'RE GONNA
TALK ABOUT WHAT GOES ON
INSIDE MY SHIRT NOW?

17:02.052 --> 17:04.524
GUYS, KARL IS REALLY HURTING.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.327
BEFORE I CAME TO THIS FAMILY,
I WAS AN OUTSIDER.

I THINK YOU NEED TO GET
YOUR PARENTS TO FORGIVE HIM.

BUT...THEN HE'LL
BE AROUND AGAIN.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.116
WHAT ABOUT YOUR
SECRET, STAN?

17:26.116 --> 17:27.677

I'LL JUST BITE MY TONGUE.

18:44.454 --> 18:47.257
AND...LOOK AT ALL THE HURT
FEELINGS THAT IT'S CAUSED.

18:47.257 --> 18:48.728
Tyler: ARE YOU EVEN SORRY

18:48.728 --> 18:51.861
YOU DROVE KARL TO EXPLODE
A BALLOON IN OUR MOTHER'S NOSE?

18:51.861 --> 18:54.664
SHE MAY NEVER HAVE BALLOONS
IN THIS HOUSE AGAIN.

18:54.664 --> 18:56.266
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CHLOE.

18:57.807 --> 18:59.639
WELL, KARL IS A NICE BOY,
AND-- ( sniffs )

18:59.639 --> 19:02.472
THIS BALLOON-Y SMELL DOES
KIND OF REMIND ME OF CLOWNS--

19:02.472 --> 19:04.574
AND WHO DOESN'T LOVE
TO SMELL CLOWNS?

19:05.715 --> 19:06.776
AND HE REALLY

19:06.776 --> 19:08.648
SEEMS TO ENJOY BEING OVER.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.820
YOU KNOW, HE DOESN'T HAVE
WHAT WE HAVE.

19:10.820 --> 19:12.922
AVERY, TYLER,
I'M PROUD OF YOU

19:12.922 --> 19:14.684
FOR THE KINDNESS
YOU'RE SHOWING KARL.

19:14.684 --> 19:15.725
IT'S A REAL SIGN
OF MATURITY.

19:15.725 --> 19:17.387
AND CHLOE, WE ARE GONNA
HAVE A TALK

19:17.387 --> 19:19.158
ABOUT A BETTER WAY
TO DEAL WITH YOUR FEELINGS.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.690
WHY DON'T YOU GO
WAIT FOR ME IN MY OFFICE.

19:20.690 --> 19:21.861
BUT--
Bennett: CHLOE.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.764
JUST 'CAUSE I'M SMALL

19:24.764 --> 19:27.797
DOESN'T MEAN VENGEANCE
DOESN'T BURN HOT IN MY HEART.

19:29.299 --> 19:31.701
I'VE BEEN SPENDING
TOO MUCH TIME
AROUND KARL, TOO.

19:34.604 --> 19:36.846
WELL, I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD
PUT ALL THIS BEHIND US

19:36.846 --> 19:38.808
AND SEE IF KARL WOULD
LIKE TO JOIN US FOR DINNER.

19:38.808 --> 19:40.179
WE'RE HAVING MEATLOAF.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.551
( thinking )
YES!
( barks )

19:41.551 --> 19:43.653
( mumbling thinking )
OW, I BIT MY TONGUE.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.756
JUST A SECOND.

19:46.756 --> 19:49.259
NOW, IF CHLOE NEVER
WAS WALTER PERKINS,

19:49.259 --> 19:51.190
HOW DID SHE KNOW WHAT
WAS WRITTEN ON THE CARD?

19:51.190 --> 19:53.192
YEAH. THAT PART
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.925
UM, I TOLD HER
'CAUSE I'M PSYCHIC.

19:55.925 --> 19:57.967
WAIT, I'LL PROVE IT--
YES.

19:57.967 --> 20:01.331
47. BACON.

20:01.331 --> 20:03.202
WHAT WAS THAT?
47?

20:03.202 --> 20:04.504
HOW DID HE KNOW?

20:08.238 --> 20:10.810
YOUR MEATLOAF WAS
ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, ELLEN.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.782
REALLY? IT TASTED
"BALLOON-Y" TO ME.

20:12.782 --> 20:15.715
YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT SMELL IS
TO YOUR SENSE OF TASTE.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.887
BUT IT'S GOOD. IT'S GOOD.
I'M GETTING USED TO IT.
IT'S FINE.

20:19.389 --> 20:21.821
DON'T TELL HER IT TASTED
"BALLOON-Y" TO ALL OF US.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.494
I THINK A DISH GLOVE
FELL IN THE MEATLOAF.

20:24.494 --> 20:26.556
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME.

20:28.658 --> 20:30.300
AS A TOKEN

20:30.300 --> 20:32.902
OF OUR NEWFOUND FRIENDSHIP,

20:32.902 --> 20:35.665
I...HAVE GIFTS FOR YOU.

20:35.665 --> 20:38.438
OH, I DON'T KNOW, KARL.
YEAH, I'M NOT REALLY MUCH
OF A HAT GUY.

20:38.438 --> 20:39.869
CHLOE, WAIT.
IT COULD BE A PRANK.

20:39.869 --> 20:41.671
IT'S JUST A HAT.

20:41.671 --> 20:42.742
I'M FINE.

20:43.873 --> 20:45.845
I'M WALTER PERKINS.

20:45.845 --> 20:48.017
WELL THAT IS KINDA NICE.

20:52.622 --> 20:53.723
OH.
OH!

20:53.723 --> 20:55.325
THIS IS MOLDY CHEESE!

20:55.325 --> 20:57.487
( whimpering )

20:57.487 --> 20:58.988
WHY CAN'T I GET THIS OFF?

20:59.989 --> 21:01.260
CHEESE IN THE FRONT,

21:01.260 --> 21:02.792
SUPER-ADHESIVE IN THE BACK.

21:02.792 --> 21:04.834
I JUST WANTED EVERYTHING
TO RETURN TO OUR NORMAL,

21:04.834 --> 21:06.436
PRANK-FILLED RIVALRY.

21:07.437 --> 21:08.898
BUT CHEESE HATS?

21:08.898 --> 21:11.571
REALLY? I THOUGHT YOU
WERE BETTER THAN THIS.

21:11.571 --> 21:12.902
( giggling )

21:12.902 --> 21:15.305
I WANTED TO TAKE THE LEAD
ON THIS ONE.

21:15.305 --> 21:17.677
WHEN VENGEANCE BURNS HOT
IN HER HEART,

21:17.677 --> 21:19.479
THERE'S NO DENYING HER.

21:19.479 --> 21:22.051
SELL ME OUT ONCE,
SHAME ON YOU.

21:22.051 --> 21:24.914
SELL ME OUT TWICE,
CHEESE ON YOU.

21:26.616 --> 21:27.917
Stan: SO KARL LESLIE FINK

21:27.917 --> 21:29.359
WAS WELCOMED
BACK INTO THE FOLD

21:29.359 --> 21:31.661
THANKS TO STAN
MORDECHAI JAMES.

21:31.661 --> 21:32.962
YES, "MORDECHAI."

21:32.962 --> 21:35.064
LONG STORY--
SOME OF IT IN HEBREW.

21:35.064 --> 21:36.826
MY POINT IS...
KARL AND I

21:36.826 --> 21:37.797
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON:

21:37.797 --> 21:39.869
MY FATHER
WASN'T AROUND MUCH,

21:39.869 --> 21:41.971
AND MY MOTHER LIKED
TO PULL THINGS WITH HER TEETH.

21:43.373 --> 21:46.476
BOTTOM LINE--NO MATTER
WHAT OUR DIFFERENCES,

21:46.476 --> 21:48.077
WE ALL SHARE ONE THING:

21:48.077 --> 21:51.941
THE NEED TO BE PART
OF A WARM, LOVING FAMILY.

21:51.941 --> 21:54.514
SOMETIMES FAMILY
CAN BE A REAL PAIN, THOUGH,

21:54.514 --> 21:55.985
LIKE WITH MY FAKE WIFE.

21:59.349 --> 22:01.791
NOT NOW, HONEY.
I'M BLOGGING.
