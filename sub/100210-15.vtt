00:00.063 --> 00:02.492
<i>Back in the '90s, an
indie comedy called "Swingers"</i>

00:02.578 --> 00:03.843
<i>exploded onto the scene.</i>

00:03.906 --> 00:05.593
<i>Everyone loved the on-screen bromance</i>

00:05.656 --> 00:07.359
<i>between Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn,</i>

00:07.438 --> 00:08.637
<i>and their catchy lingo</i>

00:08.718 --> 00:10.439
<i>inspired many friendships
at William Penn,</i>

00:10.541 --> 00:12.194
<i>where we quoted it on the regular.</i>

00:12.265 --> 00:13.311
Vegas, baby.

00:13.413 --> 00:14.765
Vegas, baby.

00:14.838 --> 00:16.233
- Vegas!
- Vegas!

00:17.272 --> 00:19.546
<i>Others were more inspired
by the movie's fashion.</i>

00:19.664 --> 00:20.730
Why are you dressed like half the dudes

00:20.832 --> 00:21.931
in my Gampaw's retirement home?

00:22.033 --> 00:23.833
I'm Trent from "Swingers"...

00:23.902 --> 00:25.068
single, confident man

00:25.136 --> 00:27.003
on the prowl for beautiful honey babies.

00:27.105 --> 00:28.705
Little baby's all growsed up.

00:28.773 --> 00:30.840
Little baby's all growsed up!

00:30.942 --> 00:32.075
I'm going.

00:32.177 --> 00:33.209
<i>But there was one student</i>

00:33.278 --> 00:34.677
<i>who definitely was not a follower</i>

00:34.779 --> 00:36.112
<i>of "Swingers" fashion.</i>

00:36.214 --> 00:37.880
<i>Lately, she was embracing a darker look</i>

00:37.949 --> 00:39.015
<i>that had me a little concerned.</i>

00:39.084 --> 00:40.283
Hey, Claudia.

00:40.352 --> 00:41.884
You didn't want to maybe
switch up your look

00:41.987 --> 00:43.052
and go with a "Swingers" vibe?

00:43.154 --> 00:44.721
No, those clothes look stupid.

00:44.789 --> 00:46.689
Stupid fresh.

00:47.959 --> 00:49.125
<i>But the biggest trend</i>

00:49.194 --> 00:50.426
<i>"Swingers" brought to William Penn</i>

00:50.528 --> 00:51.666
<i>was all about dance.</i>

00:51.744 --> 00:53.338
All right!

00:53.398 --> 00:56.866
As you know, I am required to
have one unit of dance a year,

00:56.902 --> 00:59.235
and that has always been square dancing,

00:59.337 --> 01:00.670
which nobody likes.

01:00.739 --> 01:05.241
So I'm replacing it with the
far more athletic swing dancing.

01:05.277 --> 01:08.144
Now watch and learn as Ronnie
and Weasel demonstrate.

01:08.213 --> 01:09.946
Have at it, boys.

01:10.048 --> 01:11.447
Phew.

01:11.550 --> 01:13.049
Okay, dude.

01:13.118 --> 01:14.450
It's just like we practiced
in your mom's basement.

01:14.553 --> 01:15.852
This is our moment to shine.

01:15.954 --> 01:17.120
Let's rock 'n' roll, boys!

01:19.090 --> 01:20.456

01:28.133 --> 01:29.199

<i>It was February 19th, 1990-something,</i>

01:59.419 --> 02:01.172
<i>and I was wrapping up
a class discussion.</i>

02:02.701 --> 02:05.034
Remember to read chapter six, okay?

02:05.136 --> 02:06.869
And papers are due when, Claudia?

02:06.972 --> 02:08.304
If you don't know, how should I?

02:08.372 --> 02:10.372
They're due on Tuesday,
so I do know. How 'bout that?

02:10.475 --> 02:12.508
Great. Give yourself a gold star.

02:12.577 --> 02:14.377
<i>Claudia was a student I had
been having difficulty</i>

02:14.479 --> 02:15.745
<i>getting through to,</i>

02:15.847 --> 02:17.080
<i>so when she accidentally
left her notebook</i>

02:17.182 --> 02:18.214
<i>behind that day,</i>

02:18.316 --> 02:19.415
<i>I couldn't help but skim through it</i>

02:19.517 --> 02:21.584
<i>in order to try and gain some insight.</i>

02:21.686 --> 02:25.622
"I was born to a demon mother,
fire in my veins.

02:25.724 --> 02:27.757
She steals my freedom with her voodoo,

02:27.859 --> 02:30.059
always keeps me in chains"?

02:30.161 --> 02:31.894
- "She is such a f..."
- What are you doing?

02:33.098 --> 02:35.064
I'm so sorry.

02:35.166 --> 02:36.532
But I think I get it now.

02:36.635 --> 02:37.867
I'm guessing not everything is cool

02:37.969 --> 02:39.836
- between you and your mom.
- Like you would know.

02:39.938 --> 02:42.171
Well, I just read a poem
called "Mother Sucker."

02:42.274 --> 02:44.107
And... And then there's
"Devil in a Blue Skort"

02:44.209 --> 02:45.642
and "Mom, You're a Raging..."

02:45.744 --> 02:46.876
Just mind your own business.

02:46.978 --> 02:49.112
I'm a teacher. You are my business.

02:49.214 --> 02:51.180
<i>As I struggled to connect
to a lost student,</i>

02:51.249 --> 02:53.750
<i>Wilma was rallying everyone
for a "swinging" night out.</i>

02:53.852 --> 02:55.652
All right, we're all going to

02:55.754 --> 02:57.387
Swing Dancing Night
at the Greenwood Inn.

02:57.489 --> 02:58.488
Who's game?

02:58.556 --> 02:59.522
Actually, Wilma,

02:59.591 --> 03:00.857
I don't think Julie and I can attend,

03:00.959 --> 03:03.192
'cause we have those
already established plans,

03:03.261 --> 03:04.761
- right, Julie?
- Yes.

03:04.863 --> 03:06.763
We have plans to go
swing dancing with Wilma.

03:07.632 --> 03:08.531
All right, we're in.

03:08.633 --> 03:10.967
I'm down, daddy-o.

03:11.069 --> 03:12.201
And you'll love it, CB.

03:12.304 --> 03:13.369
You won't look so out of place.

03:13.471 --> 03:14.470
Everyone wears stupid ties.

03:14.572 --> 03:16.739
Ha. I think I'm gonna pass, Wilma.

03:16.841 --> 03:18.341
My students are turning in their, uh,

03:18.443 --> 03:20.643
"Scarlet Letter" essays
by end of day Friday,

03:20.745 --> 03:21.744
and I want to get them graded.

03:21.846 --> 03:23.446
Ugh. You never come out with us.

03:23.515 --> 03:25.615
Okay. Gather up, everyone.

03:25.717 --> 03:29.252
It is that time of the year
when we have run out of money

03:29.354 --> 03:32.322
and I realize I do not have
an adequate support staff.

03:32.424 --> 03:34.457
So, who's up for some volunteering?

03:34.559 --> 03:36.459
We're here for ya, boss.
What can we do ya for?

03:36.561 --> 03:39.162
Well, first up, Saturday morning
school beautification.

03:39.230 --> 03:40.496
Use any fancy words you want...

03:40.565 --> 03:41.998
it's just picking up trash at 6:00 a.m.

03:42.100 --> 03:43.066
Sold!

03:43.101 --> 03:44.600
No better way to start my weekend.

03:44.703 --> 03:46.169
Any other volunteers?

03:46.271 --> 03:47.437
No one?

03:47.539 --> 03:49.505
All right, next up, Model U.N.

03:49.574 --> 03:50.973
We need a few advisors.

03:51.009 --> 03:53.743
Sí. Oui. Ja.

03:53.845 --> 03:55.311
Grazie, CB.

03:55.380 --> 03:57.880
And, finally, we need
someone to plant some begonias

03:57.982 --> 03:59.015
by the front entrance.

03:59.117 --> 04:00.149
Uh...

04:00.218 --> 04:01.250
Rick, how 'bout you?

04:01.353 --> 04:03.119
I don't know what begonias are,

04:03.154 --> 04:05.421
and, besides, we start
dodgeball next week,

04:05.490 --> 04:07.623
and 300 rubber balls are not
going to inflate themselves.

04:07.692 --> 04:09.425
I gotchoo, PG. I'm on it.

04:09.494 --> 04:13.596
Well, that's all, then,
and thank you to CB and CB only.

04:14.933 --> 04:16.399
I get you love your job,

04:16.468 --> 04:18.468
but grading papers on a Friday night,

04:18.536 --> 04:20.136
and now this extra volunteer work?

04:20.238 --> 04:21.971
It's like you practically
live at this school.

04:22.072 --> 04:23.706
Oh, God, that'd be absurd.

04:23.808 --> 04:25.742
Plus the insurance
wouldn't even allow that...

04:25.810 --> 04:26.976
not that I've checked.

04:27.078 --> 04:28.311
Oh, come on, CB.

04:28.413 --> 04:30.179
You're a young single guy in his 20s.

04:30.215 --> 04:32.348
You should be going out and having fun.

04:32.450 --> 04:34.717
I got to get 35 mini flags
for Model U.N.,

04:34.819 --> 04:36.252
poster board for the bake sale,

04:36.354 --> 04:37.420
and I need milk.

04:37.489 --> 04:39.288
That's three "going outs" right there,

04:39.391 --> 04:40.423
Full skedge!

04:40.492 --> 04:41.724
See? I don't even have time

04:41.826 --> 04:43.593
to say the full word "schedule"
I'm so busy.

04:43.661 --> 04:46.129
<i>Now, I didn't quite know
how to help Claudia,</i>

04:46.197 --> 04:47.930
<i>but I knew who could help me help her.</i>

04:48.032 --> 04:49.966
John, we have a Code 5 emergency.

04:50.034 --> 04:51.334
A raccoon in the cafeteria?

04:51.403 --> 04:53.669
- Is it exhibiting signs of rabies?
- No.

04:53.805 --> 04:55.972
No rabies brings it down to a Code 5-A.

04:56.074 --> 04:57.173
There's no raccoon.

04:57.242 --> 04:59.041
Then that's not a Code 5 at all.

04:59.144 --> 05:01.811
Lainey, my code system is not a toy.

05:01.880 --> 05:03.279
It's about Claudia Caughlin.

05:03.348 --> 05:04.547
She left her notebook in my class

05:04.649 --> 05:06.349
full of super-heavy emotional poetry.

05:06.418 --> 05:08.618
Poetry? Hmm. Have a seat.

05:08.686 --> 05:10.386
I don't know if you know this,
but I've been known

05:10.488 --> 05:12.088
to sling a few verses here and there.

05:12.157 --> 05:14.457
I'm actually doing
a poetry slam next week.

05:14.526 --> 05:16.125
- Wait, seriously?
- Indeed.

05:16.194 --> 05:18.294
My stage name is Furious G.

05:18.396 --> 05:20.096
Feast your ears on this.

05:20.165 --> 05:21.564
"Fish sticks.

05:21.599 --> 05:24.066
Sticks of fish I eat.

05:24.135 --> 05:26.602
Nourishment for my body home.

05:26.704 --> 05:31.340
Aquarium? A query? Yum.

05:31.409 --> 05:33.209
Once a swimmer in the tide,

05:33.278 --> 05:36.712
but now fried to keep me...

05:36.815 --> 05:38.214
alive."

05:38.283 --> 05:39.649
What [bleep] was that?

05:39.717 --> 05:40.716
I know, right?

05:40.819 --> 05:42.552
Well, Claudia's stuff
is less seafood-related

05:42.654 --> 05:44.320
and more terrible-mother-related.

05:44.422 --> 05:45.721
Oh, well, that explains why

05:45.790 --> 05:47.657
she started dressing like Lily Munster.

05:47.725 --> 05:49.892
Such a good show.

05:49.994 --> 05:51.194
I really feel for Claudia.

05:51.262 --> 05:52.795
Of course, because of
everything you went through

05:52.864 --> 05:54.297
with your mother
when you were here in school.

05:54.365 --> 05:56.332
Yes. I remember when you
forced me to talk about it

05:56.401 --> 05:58.201
in our mandatory
"Feelings Friday" sessions.

05:58.269 --> 05:59.936
And a little during
"What's up Wednesdays."

06:00.038 --> 06:02.338
And now here you are
with those unique insights

06:02.407 --> 06:04.774
and Claudia obviously
needing counseling.

06:04.843 --> 06:06.576
Exactly. So, can you help her?

06:06.678 --> 06:08.644
Lainey, you're the one
who needs to help her.

06:08.713 --> 06:09.745
You relate to her.

06:09.848 --> 06:11.314
You understand what she's going through.

06:11.382 --> 06:12.381
I guess that makes sense.

06:12.484 --> 06:14.116
You're lucky you had
a terrible childhood.

06:14.219 --> 06:15.345
I wish I could help her,

06:15.423 --> 06:18.245
but my relationship with my mother
is just so solid.

06:18.269 --> 06:20.355
- Of course it is.
- I mean, she's so loving.

06:20.379 --> 06:22.225
- Got it.
- She calls me every other day...

06:22.293 --> 06:23.793
- Good for you.
- ...just to say "I love you."

06:23.862 --> 06:25.228
I am blessed.

06:25.263 --> 06:27.230
Hey, but Furious G, on the other hand,

06:27.332 --> 06:29.966
he is a child of the streets.

06:32.737 --> 06:34.437
Oh, hey. You heading home?

06:34.539 --> 06:36.439
Careful. The manure's pretty fresh.

06:36.474 --> 06:37.707
I picked up on that.

06:37.809 --> 06:39.375
But it looks like
you're almost finished.

06:39.477 --> 06:40.910
Maybe reconsider coming out with us.

06:41.012 --> 06:42.044
Oh, I'm not almost finished.

06:42.113 --> 06:43.746
I still have to handle Mellor's balls.

06:43.815 --> 06:44.714
Oh.

06:44.816 --> 06:46.849
I have to pump up his dodgeball balls.

06:46.951 --> 06:48.885
But doing that was Mellor's excuse

06:48.987 --> 06:50.186
for why he couldn't do the flowers.

06:50.255 --> 06:52.021
Yeah, Rick said he had
a personal emergency,

06:52.090 --> 06:53.089
and it must be serious

06:53.157 --> 06:54.724
'cause he went
right to the nurse's office.

06:54.792 --> 06:56.926
The nurse's office,
where his girlfriend works?

06:58.763 --> 07:00.663
So, this is why
you dumped your work on CB?

07:00.765 --> 07:02.031
This is your emergency?

07:02.133 --> 07:04.033
Yes. Aunt Julie is the light of my life,

07:04.068 --> 07:05.902
and every time I'm not with her,
it's an emergency.

07:06.004 --> 07:07.537
He's mostly just playing
with my stickers.

07:07.605 --> 07:09.305
Ah, and I did a "grape" job.

07:09.407 --> 07:12.608
So, even though CB already
does everything around here,

07:12.677 --> 07:14.744
you saddled him with even more?

07:14.846 --> 07:16.379
Saddled? The guy loves it!

07:16.447 --> 07:17.380
Do you see how excited he gets

07:17.448 --> 07:19.115
every time he volunteers for something?

07:19.217 --> 07:20.616
I think you might be
missing the point, Rick.

07:20.718 --> 07:21.918
Thank you, Julie.

07:21.986 --> 07:24.287
Although I don't know what the point is.

07:24.389 --> 07:25.788
I just know that he's missing it.

07:25.890 --> 07:28.558
The point is CB's taking on
all this extra work

07:28.660 --> 07:31.794
because he's avoiding having
a life outside of school.

07:31.896 --> 07:32.962
Why would he do that?

07:33.064 --> 07:34.463
Wait.

07:34.566 --> 07:35.698
I think I know.

07:35.733 --> 07:37.867
Is this about how CB used
to have a crush on Lainey?

07:37.969 --> 07:39.201
Witch!

07:39.304 --> 07:41.938
Um, not wicked witch,
the mind-reader witch.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.806
Okay, we all know about that...

07:43.875 --> 07:46.242
except he's not hung up
on Lainey anymore,

07:46.344 --> 07:47.577
but he's still stuck in a rut,

07:47.645 --> 07:49.378
spending all his time here at school.

07:49.480 --> 07:50.746
I get that,

07:50.848 --> 07:52.715
for I, too, had nothing
to live for beyond these walls

07:52.817 --> 07:55.151
until I met my sweet nurse, Aunt Julie.

07:55.253 --> 07:57.253
Exactly. So, don't you see,

07:57.355 --> 07:59.855
by dumping even more
extra schoolwork on CB,

07:59.958 --> 08:02.191
you're helping to prevent him
from getting out there

08:02.293 --> 08:04.327
and maybe meeting his Aunt Julie?

08:04.429 --> 08:07.964
Impeding CB's ability to meet
his very own Aunt Julie

08:08.066 --> 08:10.433
is the worst offense a man can commit!

08:10.535 --> 08:13.002
Knowing your glory...

08:13.104 --> 08:14.804
I want every man
in the world to have you.

08:14.906 --> 08:16.005
Aww.

08:16.107 --> 08:18.464
I know you meant that to sound sweet.

08:18.570 --> 08:20.550
And it did.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.236
<i>Wilma and Coach had agreed to help CB</i>

08:23.329 --> 08:24.689
<i>spread his wings outside the school,</i>

08:24.767 --> 08:26.821
- <i>and Coach had the perfect plan.</i>
- What's this about?

08:26.931 --> 08:29.837
Okay, I know we agreed
to work together to help fix CB,

08:29.908 --> 08:31.908
but, lucky for you, I went rogue.

08:31.977 --> 08:33.577
- I am beyond nervous.
- Don't be.

08:33.645 --> 08:34.778
I was so riddled with guilt

08:34.880 --> 08:36.212
at robbing CB of his opportunity

08:36.315 --> 08:38.515
to find his very own Nurse Aunt Julie

08:38.616 --> 08:41.217
that I have gathered in his classroom...

08:44.155 --> 08:46.690
...a fine collection of
eligible single ladies.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.224
Oh, my...

08:48.327 --> 08:49.559
I was told there would be food.

08:49.628 --> 08:52.228
Uh, the... it's coming,
uh, fine single lady.

08:52.331 --> 08:53.763
Yeah.

08:53.832 --> 08:56.032
I told them there'd be
an elaborate buffet,

08:56.101 --> 08:58.635
but one of these fine ladies
is actually a nurse,

08:58.704 --> 09:01.471
three are aunts, and one is named Judy.

09:01.540 --> 09:03.840
Well, it's not Julie,
but it's pretty damn close.

09:03.909 --> 09:06.042
So, CB just waltzes in here
and picks one?

09:06.111 --> 09:07.844
This is extremely weird and awkward.

09:07.946 --> 09:09.346
Just like CB! It's perfect.

09:09.448 --> 09:10.847
Excuse me.

09:10.916 --> 09:12.115
When does the raffle start?

09:12.184 --> 09:13.917
- After the buffet.
- Oh.

09:14.019 --> 09:14.985
I also told them there was a raffle.

09:15.053 --> 09:16.119
I had to get them all in here.

09:16.188 --> 09:18.321
Buffet, raffle... what are you gonna do?

09:18.390 --> 09:20.323
Um... sorry. What is this?

09:20.392 --> 09:22.319
- CB.
- Yes?

09:22.374 --> 09:23.426
Feast your eyes

09:23.495 --> 09:25.895
on this smorgasbord
of eligible single ladies.

09:25.964 --> 09:27.063
Why... What are you doing?

09:27.132 --> 09:28.431
I am determined to help you

09:28.467 --> 09:30.634
find the same joy that I have found.

09:30.702 --> 09:32.168
Here he is, ladies! What a catch.

09:32.270 --> 09:34.270
Full head of hair, he owns his own car,

09:34.339 --> 09:36.606
and he's halfway vested
to a teacher's pension.

09:36.675 --> 09:38.408
I'll start the bidding at $20.

09:38.510 --> 09:39.776
No, no, it's not an auction.

09:39.878 --> 09:41.011
$25.

09:41.079 --> 09:42.178
Well, what the hell? I'm flexible.

09:42.247 --> 09:44.147
- Do I hear $30?!
- Okay, um,

09:44.216 --> 09:46.483
thank you so much, women,
for coming out,

09:46.585 --> 09:48.229
but I'm... I'm not looking right now.

09:48.268 --> 09:49.285
Thank you.

09:49.362 --> 09:50.387
$30!

09:50.489 --> 09:52.956
Read the room, Ethel.

09:53.058 --> 09:53.923
CB, wait.

09:54.026 --> 09:55.458
No! Good instincts, keep going.

09:55.494 --> 09:57.961
Um, thank you for whatever this was,

09:58.030 --> 09:59.496
but what was this?

09:59.564 --> 10:02.098
First, to be clear, I was not
a part of the insanity

10:02.167 --> 10:03.867
of gathering this hodgepodge of women.

10:03.969 --> 10:05.101
That was all me, baby.

10:05.170 --> 10:07.370
But it's not even about finding a woman.

10:07.406 --> 10:09.806
We just want you to spend
a little less time by yourself

10:09.875 --> 10:11.274
and a little more time
getting out there.

10:11.343 --> 10:12.642
You don't think I'm getting out there?

10:12.711 --> 10:14.411
Well, you did just tell
all those fine gals

10:14.513 --> 10:15.779
that you're not looking right now.

10:15.814 --> 10:17.580
Yeah, I'm not looking
'cause I already have someone.

10:17.683 --> 10:18.848
You do? Who?

10:18.917 --> 10:20.116
Her name is Annabelle.

10:20.152 --> 10:23.553
She's actually a model s...
Uh, catalogue, but still.

10:23.622 --> 10:24.821
We have a date Friday night.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.222
Then why didn't you tell me that

10:26.291 --> 10:28.324
instead of saying you were
grading papers on Friday night?

10:28.427 --> 10:30.293
Well, I like to keep
my private life private.

10:30.362 --> 10:32.929
You know, I always saw Julie
as a potential catalogue model.

10:32.998 --> 10:34.297
How do you get into that line of work?

10:34.366 --> 10:36.099
<i>Wilma wasn't buying CB's story,</i>

10:36.201 --> 10:38.034
<i>and as for Claudia, she wasn't sold</i>

10:38.103 --> 10:39.936
<i>on a teacher like me
wanting to help her.</i>

10:40.038 --> 10:41.538
<i>So, I tried playing a different role.</i>

10:41.640 --> 10:44.407
Hey. Don't you, like, hate the sun?

10:44.509 --> 10:46.276
It's just so bright
and all in your face.

10:46.344 --> 10:47.777
What are you doing?
Why are you dressed like that?

10:47.846 --> 10:50.080
Because I'm sick of wearing
that clown costume

10:50.182 --> 10:51.481
they make me wear here every day.

10:51.550 --> 10:54.084
This speaks to the color of my soul.

10:54.152 --> 10:57.220
You're wearing flip-flops with
little plastic flowers on them.

10:57.322 --> 10:58.688
Oh. Yes.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.423
Only because my...

11:00.525 --> 11:02.759
goth shoes are at the cobbler.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.028
So, I was thinking of replacing
my bed with a coffin.

11:05.097 --> 11:06.024
- I'm not...
- Look.

11:06.048 --> 11:07.462
Let me save you further embarrassment.

11:07.499 --> 11:08.565
I know what you're doing.

11:08.667 --> 11:09.899
You don't know anything about me.

11:10.001 --> 11:11.301
That's the thing... I do.

11:11.336 --> 11:12.736
You have a tough relationship
with your mother,

11:12.804 --> 11:14.037
and so did I when I was your age.

11:14.172 --> 11:16.239
- No way it was as bad as mine.
- Oh, yeah?

11:16.308 --> 11:18.842
I'd put my mom issues
up against yours any day.

11:18.910 --> 11:20.443
Couple weeks ago,

11:20.512 --> 11:22.245
I was five minutes late for curfew,

11:22.314 --> 11:24.714
and she grounded me for a week
and took away my Ouija board.

11:24.783 --> 11:26.282
I would've killed to have a curfew!

11:26.318 --> 11:28.051
That would've meant my mom
wanted me to come home.

11:28.153 --> 11:29.352
Last Saturday night,

11:29.421 --> 11:31.287
I forgot to tell my mom
I was going to a big party,

11:31.389 --> 11:32.822
and she showed up and dragged me out

11:32.891 --> 11:34.657
and embarrassed me
in front of all my friends.

11:34.726 --> 11:35.925
One time, when I was 11,

11:36.027 --> 11:38.294
my dad and I had to drag
my mom out of a biker bar

11:38.330 --> 11:40.430
because she was "being too rowdy."

11:40.499 --> 11:43.166
Last Christmas, I asked my mom
for tickets to see The Cure.

11:43.235 --> 11:44.300
All she got me was a bunch

11:44.402 --> 11:46.002
of stupid sweaters from Fashion Bug.

11:46.071 --> 11:48.805
Christmas. We used to celebrate those.

11:48.907 --> 11:51.474
Until one Christmas Eve, my mom
walked out on me and my dad.

11:51.543 --> 11:53.176
No reason, no warning, no letter.

11:53.278 --> 11:54.277
Just gone.

11:54.346 --> 11:56.646
I haven't seen or talked to her since.

11:57.916 --> 11:59.415
Wow.

11:59.518 --> 12:02.485
That sure beats stupid sweaters.

12:02.554 --> 12:04.420
And one was okay, actually.

12:04.489 --> 12:06.055
It had a giraffe on it.

12:07.292 --> 12:08.925
I didn't know any of that about you.

12:08.994 --> 12:09.893
Yeah.

12:09.995 --> 12:10.927
And what really helped was

12:10.996 --> 12:12.395
I started writing and performing songs

12:12.464 --> 12:13.530
about what happened.

12:13.632 --> 12:15.532
It was a great outlet for my feelings.

12:15.567 --> 12:18.067
You could perform that poem
you wrote about your mother.

12:18.136 --> 12:19.202
I can take you to a place

12:19.304 --> 12:21.738
where people get up and do slam poetry.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.640
I think it would really
help you deal with things.

12:23.708 --> 12:25.475
Maybe expressing my feelings

12:25.544 --> 12:28.111
is better than keeping them
hidden away in a notebook.

12:28.213 --> 12:29.379
Exactly.

12:29.414 --> 12:30.680
Okay. I'll go.

12:30.749 --> 12:32.348
But you're not gonna show up
like that, are you?

12:32.450 --> 12:33.316
Oh, God, no.

12:33.418 --> 12:34.417
I ran out of foundation,

12:34.486 --> 12:35.885
and my left cheek is mostly Wite-Out.

12:39.991 --> 12:41.357
- Why, hello.
- Oh.

12:41.426 --> 12:43.860
You're not Paul from upstairs
returning my cake plate.

12:43.962 --> 12:45.495
And you're not on a date with Annabelle,

12:45.564 --> 12:48.565
but I can see the name on that
little ship is Annabelle.

12:48.667 --> 12:51.100
Yes, that is because
I named it after her

12:51.169 --> 12:52.869
'cause that's how serious she and I are.

12:52.900 --> 12:53.999
What's Annabelle's last name?

12:54.085 --> 12:55.278
Bottleboat.

12:55.340 --> 12:58.367
- I have no date.
- I had a feeling.

12:58.453 --> 12:59.742
Why'd you lie?

12:59.845 --> 13:01.444
Look, I love teaching,

13:01.546 --> 13:02.912
and I don't mind saying I'm great at it.

13:03.014 --> 13:05.381
- No arguments here.
- It's totally my zone.

13:05.417 --> 13:07.016
It's where I feel most comfortable,

13:07.086 --> 13:09.285
I get a ton of positive feedback,

13:09.354 --> 13:12.222
but the things in my life
outside of my zone,

13:12.290 --> 13:14.557
well, they're not working out as well.

13:14.626 --> 13:17.193
- Like Lainey?
- No, I'm over the whole Lainey crush,

13:17.262 --> 13:20.396
but it was a reminder that
the things outside of teaching

13:20.498 --> 13:23.066
aren't a guaranteed
success for me, you know?

13:23.134 --> 13:25.768
So it's like, "Why not go
all in on my best thing?"

13:25.837 --> 13:28.004
When I first started teaching,
I was all about work.

13:28.106 --> 13:30.340
On a Friday night, there
was nothing I liked more

13:30.442 --> 13:32.542
than being at home,
dissecting a fetal pig

13:32.611 --> 13:33.943
or a frog

13:34.012 --> 13:35.645
or maybe even something I hit
with my car on my way home.

13:35.747 --> 13:37.413
- Accidentally, I hope?
- Sure.

13:37.482 --> 13:38.982
Anyway, one night,

13:39.084 --> 13:40.116
the power went out in my place,

13:40.218 --> 13:41.818
so I went to a bar down the block,

13:41.920 --> 13:44.187
and turns out
people from work were there.

13:44.256 --> 13:46.489
A couple of beers, a few Limoncellos,

13:46.591 --> 13:48.491
and a bus ticket to Atlantic City later,

13:48.560 --> 13:50.727
I now own two thirds of a goat farm.

13:50.829 --> 13:52.061
Seriously?

13:52.097 --> 13:53.863
And all this time, I've been
buying my own goat cheese.

13:53.965 --> 13:55.698
The point is that was 10 years ago,

13:55.800 --> 13:57.800
and those people are still my friends,

13:57.903 --> 13:58.935
all because I went out

13:59.037 --> 14:00.870
and connected with other people.

14:00.972 --> 14:02.639
So, come dancing.

14:02.707 --> 14:04.674
And if you don't do it for you,
do it for us.

14:04.743 --> 14:07.043
- We like having you around.
- Thanks.

14:07.112 --> 14:08.945
I like being around you guys, too.

14:09.047 --> 14:10.680
But I'm gonna take a rain check,

14:10.782 --> 14:12.615
and, you know, maybe next time.

14:12.684 --> 14:14.350
Okay.

14:14.419 --> 14:15.652
Maybe next time.

14:15.720 --> 14:17.520
Cool.

14:17.622 --> 14:21.057
All right. Let's welcome our next
poet to the stage, Furious G.

14:21.126 --> 14:22.725
Whoo!

14:24.596 --> 14:26.229
You all know me.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.431
This is a little piece that I wrote.

14:28.533 --> 14:30.500
It's called "Within the Lines."

14:31.937 --> 14:35.672
"Parking spot, my spot to park.

14:35.740 --> 14:39.642
You see me with the day, start and end.

14:39.678 --> 14:41.277
I drive away."

14:43.715 --> 14:45.248
All right.

14:48.787 --> 14:52.066
Thank you, Furious G.
That was about a parking spot.

14:52.120 --> 14:54.388
Next up, we'll bring
a new poet to our stage.

14:54.413 --> 14:57.047
Please give a warm welcome to Claudia.

14:57.083 --> 14:58.127
You can do this.

14:58.196 --> 14:59.829
Just get it all out,
share your feelings.

14:59.898 --> 15:02.513
Thanks. I know it'll feel good
to get this off my chest.

15:05.236 --> 15:06.469
I am proud of you, Lainey,

15:06.571 --> 15:09.405
and how well you've taken
my sage advice.

15:09.474 --> 15:11.407
Okay, here we go.

15:11.509 --> 15:12.809
"Oh, brother,

15:12.911 --> 15:15.945
gross boy on the other end
of our Jack and Jill bathroom,

15:16.047 --> 15:17.180
how I hate you."

15:17.240 --> 15:18.279
Wait. What's that now?

15:18.304 --> 15:20.383
"Dried toothpaste blobs in the sink,

15:20.485 --> 15:22.518
toilet bowl filled with stink,

15:22.587 --> 15:24.787
your crusty towel hung akimbo.

15:24.889 --> 15:26.022
Oh, bro.

15:26.124 --> 15:28.591
No, no, no."

15:31.296 --> 15:33.029
The [bleep] was that?

15:33.131 --> 15:35.732
Oh, my God. I was so nervous,
but I did it.

15:35.834 --> 15:36.966
Yeah, congrats.

15:37.035 --> 15:38.668
But what happened to that
poem trashing your mom?

15:38.737 --> 15:40.269
Oh, I don't need to read
that one anymore.

15:40.338 --> 15:42.105
Why not? It was your chance
to let it all out.

15:42.207 --> 15:45.942
Now, everyone, give it up for
our next poet, Li'l Street Rat.

15:46.044 --> 15:47.777
- He's good.
- No. Uh, sorry, no.

15:47.846 --> 15:49.579
Go back to your seat. Don't give it up.

15:49.681 --> 15:50.913
Go back to your seat, Li'l Rat Face.

15:50.982 --> 15:52.248
Claudia has another poem.

15:52.350 --> 15:54.050
- Right, Claudia?
- No, I don't.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.418
Yes, you do.
It's called "Mother Sucker."

15:55.520 --> 15:57.153
It's about her mom,
really lets her have it.

15:57.222 --> 15:58.688
Lainey, it's okay.
She doesn't want to...

15:58.790 --> 16:00.023
Not now, Furious G.

16:00.091 --> 16:01.424
I'm not reading it, Ms. Lewis.

16:01.526 --> 16:03.426
Yes, you are. You have to.

16:03.528 --> 16:04.660
You can't just bottle up

16:04.763 --> 16:05.795
all these negative feelings
about your mother.

16:05.864 --> 16:07.663
It will only mess you up
for years to come.

16:07.766 --> 16:09.032
But my mom and I are good now.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.034
- No, you're not. You hate her.
- Not anymore.

16:11.136 --> 16:13.136
After you told me about what a disaster

16:13.238 --> 16:14.504
your relationship was with your mother

16:14.606 --> 16:15.799
and what she did to you,

16:15.916 --> 16:18.341
it made me realize
I'm lucky my mom's still here.

16:18.443 --> 16:22.078
So I went home and I talked
to her and I shared my feelings.

16:22.147 --> 16:25.281
Anyways, my mom and I are making
Rice Krispie treats tonight.

16:25.383 --> 16:27.917
- See you Monday.
- Bye.

16:28.019 --> 16:29.619
She was supposed to go
up there and read that poem

16:29.721 --> 16:31.054
that vented all her anger at my mom.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.422
Your mom?

16:32.524 --> 16:34.857
- No, her mom, not mine.
- Lainey, I think...

16:34.959 --> 16:36.824
Don't try to make this
a thing about me and my mom.

16:36.909 --> 16:38.227
This is all about Claudia.

16:38.296 --> 16:40.520
Thanks a lot
for making me do this, John.

16:42.958 --> 16:46.411
<i>Wilma's efforts to get CB to
join the fun didn't quite land,</i>

16:46.497 --> 16:48.130
<i>but even alone at home,
there were some people</i>

16:48.199 --> 16:49.140
<i>he couldn't dodge.</i>

16:49.218 --> 16:51.937
<i>Hey, CB! It's Rick Mellor,</i>

16:52.023 --> 16:53.812
<i>Coach Rick Mellor from William Penn.</i>

16:53.875 --> 16:55.085
<i>Hey, CB.</i>

16:55.171 --> 16:58.305
<i>Anyway, Julie, Wilma, and I
are at Swing Dancing Night.</i>

16:58.399 --> 17:00.299
<i>- You should come by!
- Not the same without you!</i>

17:00.361 --> 17:01.560
<i>Uh, by the way, first drink's on...</i>

17:01.628 --> 17:03.795
<i>Hey, CB. Coach Rick again.</i>

17:03.864 --> 17:05.196
<i>Uh, I think I got cut off there,</i>

17:05.232 --> 17:06.798
<i>so I was just calling back
to make sure you heard</i>

17:06.867 --> 17:08.032
<i>the first drink's on me.</i>

17:08.102 --> 17:09.434
<i>Come on out and dance with us!</i>

17:09.536 --> 17:11.022
<i>Anyway, I really hope you can make...</i>

17:11.093 --> 17:12.780
<i>- Rick again.
- We love you, CB!</i>

17:12.858 --> 17:14.039
<i>I just want you to know I was saying</i>

17:14.108 --> 17:15.339
<i>I really hope you can join us.</i>

17:15.442 --> 17:16.708
<i>Again, this is Rick Mel...</i>

17:16.810 --> 17:18.109
<i>...lor.</i>

17:18.212 --> 17:19.705
<i>I got cut off at "Mell," so I don't...</i>

17:19.784 --> 17:21.213
<i>- CB! CB!
- I don't want you to think, uh,</i>

17:21.281 --> 17:22.614
<i>it's Rick Mell, some strange guy.</i>

17:22.683 --> 17:24.683
<i>It's actually Mellor. Mellor.</i>

17:26.553 --> 17:27.689
These baristas.

17:27.823 --> 17:30.267
I clearly told them
that my name is Furious G,

17:30.353 --> 17:32.993
and they wrote "Furbiest Gene."

17:33.052 --> 17:34.922
That's not even a real name.

17:35.065 --> 17:37.265
I can't believe I screwed up so bad.

17:37.326 --> 17:39.393
Well, your goal was to help Claudia,

17:39.462 --> 17:40.561
and you did just that.

17:40.629 --> 17:41.662
Yeah, by showing her

17:41.731 --> 17:43.697
how humiliatingly worse my childhood was

17:43.766 --> 17:45.566
and what a mess I apparently still am?

17:45.668 --> 17:47.735
Come on, Lainey. You're not a mess.

17:47.803 --> 17:49.236
It's just that helping Claudia

17:49.305 --> 17:51.739
brought up some old, unresolved issues.

17:51.807 --> 17:54.141
She left more than 10 years ago.

17:54.210 --> 17:55.442
I thought I was over it.

17:55.544 --> 17:57.244
Well, maybe you should take

17:57.346 --> 17:58.912
the same advice that you gave Claudia.

17:59.015 --> 18:00.381
She didn't take my advice.

18:00.449 --> 18:02.916
I told her to express her
feelings to the audience here.

18:03.019 --> 18:04.351
She went and expressed them to her mom.

18:04.420 --> 18:06.653
And it seems like that
really worked out for her.

18:06.722 --> 18:09.757
You know, Lainey, sometimes
when you help a student,

18:09.859 --> 18:11.692
they can end up helping you.

18:12.962 --> 18:14.328
Thank you, Furious G.

18:14.430 --> 18:16.196
Yo.

18:16.232 --> 18:18.699
<i>Glascott had helped me see
all the good I'd done for Claudia,</i>

18:18.801 --> 18:21.001
<i>but as Swing Dancing Night
went into full effect,</i>

18:21.070 --> 18:22.636
<i>CB was still nowhere to be found.</i>

18:22.738 --> 18:25.406
<i>So Julie, Coach, and Wilma made
the best of it without him.</i>

18:25.508 --> 18:26.940
Julie, I don't know how you did it,

18:27.009 --> 18:28.842
but you are looking both cute and hot.

18:28.911 --> 18:30.744
Oh, well, thanks.
I could say the same about you.

18:30.846 --> 18:31.912
Ah!

18:32.014 --> 18:34.014
Hello, ladies... and Rick.

18:34.116 --> 18:35.482
Whoa, that is one heck of a suit.

18:35.551 --> 18:36.850
Thanks. It was my grandfather's.

18:36.952 --> 18:38.018
It's really nice.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.753
He died in it.

18:52.268 --> 18:54.601
Oh, look at this!

18:54.670 --> 18:56.203
CB, you came out.

18:56.272 --> 18:58.038
- I did.
- Did you bring Annabelle?

18:58.140 --> 19:01.175
Um, let's just say
my relationship with her sank.

19:01.243 --> 19:03.877
But turns out I have
some really pushy friends

19:03.979 --> 19:05.512
that I'm very lucky to have.

19:05.614 --> 19:06.780
We're lucky, too.

19:08.317 --> 19:09.983
<i>Life is full of challenges,</i>

19:10.052 --> 19:11.919
<i>and they can be scary to face alone,</i>

19:12.021 --> 19:13.220
<i>but that's why it's important
to remember</i>

19:13.322 --> 19:14.788
<i>that with friends by your side,</i>

19:14.857 --> 19:16.957
<i>you'll never have to.</i>

19:17.059 --> 19:18.959
<i>'Cause even in the most
difficult of times,</i>

19:19.061 --> 19:21.195
<i>if you have the support of
those who care about you,</i>

19:21.263 --> 19:23.971
<i>you'll find those tough moments
get a whole lot easier.</i>

19:26.469 --> 19:28.836
<i>So if someone wants to
lend a helping hand,</i>

19:28.938 --> 19:30.307
<i>take it.</i>

19:31.607 --> 19:33.407
<i>Because when we connect with each other,</i>

19:33.509 --> 19:35.576
<i>the possibilities are endless.</i>

19:40.983 --> 19:44.218
<i>And some challenges are a lot
harder to face than others.</i>

19:44.320 --> 19:46.620
<i>But you need to have faith
that the harder it is,</i>

19:46.689 --> 19:48.622
<i>the bigger the reward will be.</i>

19:48.691 --> 19:51.425
<i>So when you find yourself
nervous or afraid,</i>

19:51.527 --> 19:52.993
<i>know that the best way through it all</i>

19:53.062 --> 19:55.162
<i>is to face it head-on.</i>

19:55.231 --> 19:58.052
<i>'Cause in the end, it just
might open up new doors</i>

19:58.138 --> 20:00.200
<i>to something even better.</i>

20:05.007 --> 20:06.507
Hey, Dad.

20:06.575 --> 20:09.009
I was thinking maybe
it's time I talked to Mom.

20:09.111 --> 20:10.628
Do you have her number?

20:12.675 --> 20:14.612
This is a little thing
I call "Crazy World."

20:14.722 --> 20:16.776
"In crazy times, I build a bridge

20:16.862 --> 20:19.296
from my jumbled mind to my mini fridge

20:19.398 --> 20:21.231
inside of which resides the cure

20:21.333 --> 20:23.867
to a world so cold and so impure.

20:23.969 --> 20:27.683
When pain and strife in one do mingle,

20:27.776 --> 20:30.647
I open the door and get
my Kraft Single."

20:30.772 --> 20:32.842
So deep how he uses Kraft Singles

20:32.945 --> 20:34.983
as a metaphor for achieving inner peace.

20:35.100 --> 20:36.066
No, not a metaphor.

20:36.168 --> 20:37.326
He's literally talking about cheese.

20:37.388 --> 20:39.045
This is called "Wherever Did You Go?"

20:39.204 --> 20:41.238
"The silver screen is now laid bare,

20:41.340 --> 20:44.774
a shadow of the glory
that was once there.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.644
You looked so silky, lush, and hip

20:47.746 --> 20:49.563
perched atop the upper lip

20:49.657 --> 20:53.438
of a man so full of style and panache.

20:53.493 --> 20:56.454
"Please come back,
Burt Reynold's mustache."

20:56.571 --> 20:58.223
That can't be about Burt...

20:58.286 --> 21:00.567
Burt Reynold's mustache.
Yes, it absolutely was.
