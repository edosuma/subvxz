-[woman 1] Marker.
-[woman 2] Gorgeous.

00:04.796 --> 00:06.965
-Did I hear "gorgeous"?
-[woman 2] You heard "gorgeous," yes.

00:09.509 --> 00:11.678
Did anybody say "exquisite"?

00:12.053 --> 00:13.138
[woman 2] Exquisite.

00:13.221 --> 00:17.392
How about, "Oh, my God"? Nobody said that?

00:17.475 --> 00:19.978
-[woman 2] Oh, my God.
-Yeah, oh, that's good.

00:20.061 --> 00:21.062
I heard that.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.018
Betty White.

01:00.101 --> 01:01.811
-Betty White.
-Betty White.

-It was Betty, Betty, darling Betty White.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.948
[clicks tongue] Betty White.
Betty White, ladies and gentlemen.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.408
[laughs]

01:17.869 --> 01:19.662
[people speaking indistinctly]

01:19.746 --> 01:21.790
This is one of those special nights

01:21.873 --> 01:25.835
when a community comes together and says,
"You did a good job."

01:25.919 --> 01:27.420
You did a good job, Betty White.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.507
-She's a long-distance runner.
-If you're that good--

01:30.590 --> 01:33.259
That's right. If you're that good,
you can survive.

01:34.677 --> 01:38.056
Longevity is a big deal.
Like, she's broken all the barriers.

01:38.139 --> 01:39.766
Now, she's in her 90s.

01:39.849 --> 01:41.643
There's nothing...
no barrier left to break.

01:44.312 --> 01:46.898
-It's so nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

01:46.981 --> 01:47.816
How are you?

01:48.066 --> 01:49.150
Right this way, ladies.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.237
-Big smile, big smile. Right on.

<i>Ms. Betty White!</i>

01:55.657 --> 01:57.283
[all cheering and applauding]

02:01.538 --> 02:06.709
She's done so much amazing work.
She's unstoppable, I'm sure, right?

02:06.793 --> 02:07.794
[laughs]

02:08.586 --> 02:13.091
<i>Well, this is a lovely, lovely</i>
<i>surprise tonight,</i>

02:13.174 --> 02:17.428
<i>and it's also a chance</i>
<i>for me to say thank you...</i>

02:18.388 --> 02:22.851
<i>for spoiling me rotten for so many years.</i>

02:23.434 --> 02:25.937
<i>I truly appreciate it,</i>

02:26.020 --> 02:30.942
<i>and it's just the best business to be in.</i>

02:31.025 --> 02:34.821
She's been around forever.
What an amazing career.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.531
<i>That's how she's influenced me.</i>

02:36.823 --> 02:38.199
[all cheering, applauding]

02:42.537 --> 02:43.663
One of the things she always says,

02:43.746 --> 02:46.833
which I think is so interesting,
and I had never thought of it,

02:46.916 --> 02:51.462
"When you're a film star,
people see you on a great big screen,

02:51.546 --> 02:55.049
um, and they go somewhere,
and they pay to see you on the screen,

02:55.133 --> 02:58.469
and so those people feel
kind of untouchable."

02:58.553 --> 03:00.847
And she always says, you know,
"I've been in people's homes

03:01.139 --> 03:02.348
for 70 years,

03:02.432 --> 03:05.310
so people always feel like
I'm just accessible."

03:05.393 --> 03:07.854
She's this incredibly authentic,

03:07.937 --> 03:10.398
charming, talented, funny woman,

03:10.481 --> 03:12.984
and you can put somebody

03:13.067 --> 03:15.904
who's as multifaceted as Betty
in any situation,

03:15.987 --> 03:18.323
so because of that and by virtue of that,
she's always gonna be relevant,

03:18.406 --> 03:20.074
she's always gonna be,
you know, of the moment,

03:20.158 --> 03:23.244
and I think that's what
really makes her special.

03:23.328 --> 03:26.956
[all cheering, applauding]

03:27.040 --> 03:30.376
We decided to, you know, make some moves

03:30.501 --> 03:32.712
and take some chances in her career.

03:33.004 --> 03:37.175
It really started taking off
when she guested

03:37.258 --> 03:42.222
on the William Shatner roast
for Comedy Central.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.599
Betty White, ladies and gentlemen.

03:44.682 --> 03:46.267
[all cheering]

03:50.104 --> 03:54.025
Roasts are very risqué at times,

03:54.108 --> 03:59.822
and they wrote a lot of material
that Betty decided to go with.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.158
But you look great.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.493
[chuckles softly]

04:03.576 --> 04:05.870
You know, they make one percent milk now.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.330
[all laugh]

04:14.587 --> 04:18.299
Darling, you were supposed
to explore the galaxy,

04:18.383 --> 04:19.717
not fill it.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.386
[all laughing]

04:22.428 --> 04:25.598
When people saw that,
I mean, it was, you know,

04:25.682 --> 04:28.059
a little jarring and then really funny

04:28.142 --> 04:29.727
because you saw that side of her

04:29.811 --> 04:31.729
that you don't get to see
very often, you know?

04:31.813 --> 04:32.772
Just a little sassy.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.275
She didn't shy away from it,
and from that,

04:35.525 --> 04:37.735
people saw a little different side
of Betty,

04:37.819 --> 04:39.362
and it opened things up.

04:39.445 --> 04:42.282
-[coach] Hut.
-[men grunting]

04:42.407 --> 04:44.158
[indistinct shouting]

04:44.867 --> 04:46.744
[grunts]

04:46.828 --> 04:48.413
[coach] Mike, come on!

04:48.496 --> 04:50.665
It was a different image of Betty White

04:50.748 --> 04:52.166
than we'd seen in the past, you know,

04:52.250 --> 04:54.252
like, the whole, you know,
"So's your old man,"

04:54.335 --> 04:56.004
or, "That's not what your
girlfriend said last night."

04:56.254 --> 04:58.256
-Mike, what is your deal, man?
-Oh, come on, man.

04:58.339 --> 04:59.716
You've been riding me all day.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.092
Mike, you're playing like
Betty White out there.

05:01.175 --> 05:02.468
That's not what your girlfriend said.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.095
-Baby!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:04.345 --> 05:10.351
She kind of got launched
into this pop-icon status, which--

05:10.435 --> 05:12.145
And then she was kind of doing everything.

05:12.228 --> 05:16.733
[all] Live from New York,
it's <i>Saturday Night!</i>

05:16.941 --> 05:18.359
[Witjas] <i>There was a young man, I believe,</i>

05:18.443 --> 05:20.695
<i>in Austin, Texas,</i>
<i>who started that campaign.</i>

05:20.778 --> 05:24.407
He said he was driving along
one night in Texas,

05:24.490 --> 05:27.660
and he was thinking about Betty White.
I said, "How old are you?"

05:27.744 --> 05:29.746
The Facebook campaign went crazy,

05:29.829 --> 05:32.206
and then <i>SNL </i>obviously took it seriously.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.792
[Witjas]<i> I talked to Lorne Michaels,</i>
<i>and we found out, you know,</i>

05:34.876 --> 05:37.420
<i>who was gonna come back from the cast.</i>

05:37.628 --> 05:40.298
Lorne was making it more
of a Mother's Day show,

05:40.631 --> 05:41.924
which was very special.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.342
I've done <i>SNL,</i>

05:43.426 --> 05:44.677
<i>and it's hard.</i>

05:45.595 --> 05:48.806
[Witjas] <i>Betty rehearsed vigorously</i>
<i>all week.</i>

05:48.890 --> 05:53.019
Thursday, Betty looks at me with a look

05:53.102 --> 05:55.480
that I've never seen before,

05:55.563 --> 05:57.648
and she says, "Never again."

05:57.732 --> 06:01.110
Maybe I pushed her a little too far
and a little too much,

06:01.194 --> 06:03.905
because I was pushing her
out of her comfort zone,

06:03.988 --> 06:05.531
and then she said it.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.826
She looked, went right back
into the regular Betty White

06:08.910 --> 06:10.161
right after she said it.

06:10.244 --> 06:16.709
Stage fright is uncomfortable
and all that,

06:16.793 --> 06:21.589
but it's a life-saver,
because the panic that sets in

06:21.672 --> 06:23.257
you've got to counter,

06:23.341 --> 06:26.219
and you've got to get a handle on that

06:26.302 --> 06:29.180
in order to do what you're doing,

06:29.263 --> 06:34.227
so the stage fright is what puts the edge,
I think, on a performance.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.437
[man] Betty White!

06:37.563 --> 06:40.441
[Witjas]<i> I sat back and said,</i>
<i>"Hmm, maybe I pushed her. Maybe I did."</i>

06:40.525 --> 06:42.235
But I said, "No, no,
she's still gonna deliver.

06:42.318 --> 06:43.277
She's gonna come through."

06:43.361 --> 06:46.864
I have so many people
to thank for being here,

06:46.948 --> 06:49.867
but I really have to thank Facebook.

06:49.951 --> 06:52.286
[all cheering, applauding]

06:54.789 --> 06:56.707
When I first heard about the campaign

06:56.791 --> 06:58.626
to get me to host <i>Saturday Night Live,</i>

06:58.709 --> 07:01.754
I didn't know what Facebook was.

07:01.838 --> 07:02.839
[all laugh]

07:02.922 --> 07:05.091
And now that I do know what it is,

07:05.174 --> 07:09.303
I have to say, it sounds like
a huge waste of time.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.973
[all cheering, applauding]

07:12.056 --> 07:15.059
I can't believe Betty did <i>SNL</i> at that age

07:15.143 --> 07:17.311
and not only did <i>SNL</i> at that age,

07:17.395 --> 07:19.355
but took the ball and knocked it
so far out of the park.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.648
Bless their hearts.

07:20.731 --> 07:25.194
When I did it, they brought
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler,

07:25.278 --> 07:29.532
and they brought the original
wonderful people back,

07:29.615 --> 07:33.995
which gives you all that surrounding
with all those pros.

07:34.078 --> 07:35.788
<i>♪ We love you ♪</i>

07:35.872 --> 07:38.040

07:40.460 --> 07:41.544
To have that opportunity

07:41.627 --> 07:43.421
to work with the Tina Feys of the world

07:43.504 --> 07:46.215
and Kristen Wiigs and these young

07:46.299 --> 07:49.469
writer-actress-producers, you know,

07:49.552 --> 07:52.847
I mean, they're kind of
what she was so many years ago.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.016
Hey, everybody, look what I wrassled up!

07:55.099 --> 07:57.143
[overlapping chatter]

07:57.643 --> 07:59.812
Young woman,
you get that fish out of my parlor.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.564
What has gotten into you?

08:01.647 --> 08:02.982

08:05.485 --> 08:07.612
<i>We got to do a week at </i>SNL<i> with Betty.</i>

08:07.695 --> 08:10.031
All the women of <i>SNL </i>got to do
that Mother's Day show with her,

08:10.114 --> 08:12.742
and it was inspiring just to see, one,

08:12.825 --> 08:15.161
that her timing just rock-solid still.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.038
Uh, what is your last name, ma'am?

08:17.121 --> 08:19.165
Blarfingal.

08:20.249 --> 08:21.709
Can you spell that for me?

08:21.792 --> 08:23.753
S-M-I-T-H.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.215
She grew up in live television.

08:27.298 --> 08:28.674
That's what she does,

08:28.758 --> 08:33.846
and even at 88,
she's going to love doing live television.

08:34.096 --> 08:35.515
She's Betty White.

08:35.723 --> 08:38.017
Florence, there's a tangy taste
in this muffin.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.185
Is that a cherry?

08:41.103 --> 08:45.441
No, no, my muffin hasn't had
a cherry since 1939.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.903
[audience cheering, applauding]

08:49.862 --> 08:52.198
People think,
"Oh, well, poor old Betty White,

08:52.281 --> 08:54.158
she doesn't know what she's saying."

08:54.242 --> 08:55.117
[chuckles]

08:55.201 --> 08:57.537
Oh, yes, you do. [laughs]

08:57.662 --> 09:00.623
Her demographic sort of exploded.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.917
You know, all of a sudden,
there were kids who were five,

09:03.000 --> 09:04.585
and people who were 95

09:04.669 --> 09:09.048
that just loved her across the board,
and she became "cool."

09:09.131 --> 09:14.971
All at once, this character actress
became a star,

09:15.054 --> 09:17.431
and what I find fascinating is that

09:17.515 --> 09:19.350
she's the only one who doesn't know it,

09:19.934 --> 09:22.812
because I don't think she ever
framed her life that way.

09:23.437 --> 09:27.024
Here with Hollywood legend
and Hollywood local Betty White.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.693
Betty, you grew up here in Hollywood.

09:28.776 --> 09:32.363
I came out when I was
a year and a half old. Uh--

09:32.446 --> 09:33.823
You moved out on your own then?

09:33.906 --> 09:38.578
No, no, I had a mother and father
who brought me out here,

09:38.661 --> 09:42.498
but I don't think California
was a state yet.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.375
-I think we were still a territory.
-[all laugh]

09:44.625 --> 09:46.085
Betty was an only child.

09:47.211 --> 09:49.130
<i>Horace and Tess, her mom and dad.</i>

09:49.922 --> 09:54.427

but taught to appreciate it.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.470
<i>Oh, they were great.</i>

09:56.846 --> 09:59.348
When I picked parents, I picked doozies.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.310
[Tony Fantozzi] <i>Her mother</i>

10:02.393 --> 10:07.481

She was a cockeyed optimist.

10:10.943 --> 10:14.530
<i>She always made the point that,</i>
<i>if you look at those negatives,</i>

10:14.614 --> 10:16.532
you spoil all the good stuff,

and it goes by, and it's gone,
and you haven't tasted it,

<i>In Betty's own life,</i>

11:04.372 --> 11:07.958

11:08.042 --> 11:10.795
They were as important in my world

11:10.878 --> 11:12.797
almost as my mother and dad.

11:12.880 --> 11:17.551
Betty actually began
doing a test for television in 1939.

11:17.843 --> 11:22.014
She wore her dress
from graduation in high school,

11:22.098 --> 11:25.101
and Betty sang a Jeanette MacDonald song,

11:25.184 --> 11:27.603
which is just, I think, amazing.

11:28.145 --> 11:34.151
[White]<i> I was just lucky</i>
<i>there was a local station, Channel 13,</i>

11:34.235 --> 11:38.155
<i>and I did a silly little song on the show,</i>

11:39.156 --> 11:43.202
<i>and a disc jockey, Al Jarvis,</i>
<i>saw me, and he called me.</i>

11:43.285 --> 11:45.329
<i>He said, "I'm starting a television show,</i>

11:45.413 --> 11:47.957
<i>and I'd like you to be my girl Friday."</i>

11:49.583 --> 11:53.087
And I said, "Oh, gee, that's--
Yes, of course!"

11:53.170 --> 11:56.507
And it turned out was Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday,

11:56.590 --> 11:57.967
<i>Thursday, Friday, Saturday.</i>

11:58.050 --> 12:01.762
<i>We were on six days a week,</i>
<i>five-and-a-half hours a day.</i>

12:02.054 --> 12:03.431
She not only did an hour,

12:03.514 --> 12:05.433
she did a whole day on the coast.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.101
[laughing] Five hours or something.

12:07.184 --> 12:08.227
Nobody ever did that.

12:08.310 --> 12:09.645
No script, no anything.

12:09.728 --> 12:11.814
It was like going to television college.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.149
It was wonderful.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.733
It was just wild.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.819
Whenever they wanted to do
some kind of a show,

12:16.902 --> 12:19.029
they'd say, "Well, how will we do this?"

12:19.113 --> 12:20.823
I said, "Just do it."

12:21.073 --> 12:23.117
Al Jarvis hadn't done
any television, either.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.578
Al Jarvis was a radio DJ.

12:25.661 --> 12:29.248
[White] <i>He just thought he would move</i>
<i>his radio show to television,</i>

12:29.331 --> 12:30.708
so we'd put on the records,

12:30.791 --> 12:33.252
and, oh, the phones would blow up,

12:33.335 --> 12:35.087
and people would write and say,

12:35.171 --> 12:36.464
"We don't know what you're talking.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.257
We see you talking, and we can't hear you.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.842
We can hear the records on the radio.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.385
We want to know
what you're talking about."

12:41.469 --> 12:44.346
So after the first week,
they deep-sixed the records.

12:45.055 --> 12:49.810
We thought, "Well, what'll we do now
with no records to play?" [laughs]

12:49.894 --> 12:51.729
Doing that much live television

12:51.812 --> 12:54.732
for that long gives you a skill set.

12:54.815 --> 12:56.400
I mean, she had to start
with that skill set.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.818
Let's be real.

12:57.902 --> 13:01.697
But she honed it
in those four years really quite well.

13:01.864 --> 13:05.242
Whoever came to town
would come through our show.

13:05.326 --> 13:09.038
It was the only game in town,
and you'd meet everybody.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.290
<i>It became very successful.</i>

13:12.917 --> 13:15.878
<i>Don Fedderson, the manager of the station,</i>

13:15.961 --> 13:18.214
<i>called us in and said,</i>

13:18.297 --> 13:20.382
<i>"That little husband-and-wife thing</i>
<i>that you do,</i>

13:20.466 --> 13:23.802
could you make that into a series?"

13:24.803 --> 13:27.848
<i>In my wisdom,</i>
<i>I really was on top of everything.</i>

13:27.932 --> 13:29.767
<i>I said, "Well, it won't work.</i>

13:30.184 --> 13:33.395
<i>We do them like anecdotes that</i>
<i>a husband and wife will tell,</i>

13:33.479 --> 13:34.647
<i>you know, in an evening,</i>

13:34.730 --> 13:37.358
but if you stretch that into a half hour,

13:37.441 --> 13:38.651
it goes flat in the middle.

13:38.734 --> 13:40.819
No, it won't work."

13:41.153 --> 13:43.531
Well, he said, "Try it." So we did.

13:43.614 --> 13:46.158
That was my first series,
[chuckling] <i>Life with Elizabeth.</i>

13:47.409 --> 13:51.121
[narrator reading]

13:53.499 --> 13:55.876
[applause]

13:57.294 --> 13:59.171
Incident number one
in the <i>Life of Elizabeth</i>

13:59.255 --> 14:02.049
occurs every time
she and Alvin play a game,

14:02.132 --> 14:05.010
like checkers, gin rummy, or chess.

14:05.302 --> 14:07.972
<i>Life With Elizabeth,</i> we did that in...

14:08.055 --> 14:10.349
[inhales] ...the early '50s,

14:11.475 --> 14:14.270
<i>did it live at the Beverly Hills Theater,</i>

14:14.353 --> 14:16.480
<i>a local movie house now,</i>

14:16.605 --> 14:18.732
<i>but we used to do television shows there.</i>

14:18.941 --> 14:21.527
All these shows were L-I-V-E.

14:21.610 --> 14:24.488
The red light came on,
and you went on for 30 minutes.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.283
<i>It was great, great fun.</i>

14:27.366 --> 14:29.243
-Dime says I hit it.
-Okay, you got a bet.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.661
Hey, wait a minute. Hit what? Wait.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.329
-[thud]
-That fence.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.914
-Pay up.
-Oh, no.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.959
You picked out your target
after you hit it.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.295
Well, if you're stupid enough
to make a bet like that,

14:39.378 --> 14:41.171
that's your lookout.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.631
Dime says I hit that tree.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.550
Yeah, that's more like it. Which tree?

14:44.633 --> 14:45.801
-Wait.
-[thuds]

14:45.885 --> 14:47.386
-That one.
-Oh.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.056
Nobody remembers <i>Life With Elizabeth.</i>

14:51.140 --> 14:53.434
They weren't born when
<i>Life With Elizabeth </i>was on.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.478
<i>George Tibbles, and I produced it,</i>

14:56.562 --> 15:01.317
and we had about $1.95
for a budget for each show.

15:01.775 --> 15:04.111
<i>We played against</i>
<i>sort of a flat background.</i>

15:04.194 --> 15:07.239
<i>We had a couch and a couple</i>
<i>of living room chairs.</i>

15:07.323 --> 15:08.866
You never knew what was gonna happen.

15:08.949 --> 15:10.743
You never knew when a camera
was gonna break,

15:10.826 --> 15:13.579
when a film was gonna break,
when you'd have to go out and stand there

15:13.662 --> 15:16.165
and talk for five minutes
just to fill air time.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.210
[Mikelas] <i>The audience for her</i>
<i>show was up above.</i>

15:20.294 --> 15:23.005
<i>Climbing that ladder to talk</i>
<i>to them was part of her warm-up.</i>

15:23.088 --> 15:25.090
<i>She did the warm-up for her own show</i>

15:25.174 --> 15:26.508
to get them engaged and going,

15:26.592 --> 15:28.344
and how cool is that?

15:30.179 --> 15:34.350
[White] <i>NBC had seen the local talk show.</i>

15:35.184 --> 15:39.188
They said, "Do you think, Betty,
could you do--

15:39.271 --> 15:42.191
It's a half-hour every single day.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.026
That's five days a week.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.570
Do you think you could sustain that?"

15:47.613 --> 15:50.449
<i>And I thought, "What am I gonna</i>
<i>do with the rest of the time?</i>

15:50.532 --> 15:53.369

16:59.935 --> 17:01.854
Sure did.
I did something a little different.

17:01.937 --> 17:04.815
I rehearsed with a choral group

17:04.898 --> 17:08.485
that's going to do Christmas carols
this Christmas.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.280
Oh, wonderful. You're going around

The first TV show I'd ever been on,

Well, by now, we were national,
and we were all over the country,

18:02.873 --> 18:07.461
and all through the South,
there was this whole ruckus.

18:07.544 --> 18:10.631
They didn't-- They were going
to take our show off the air

18:10.714 --> 18:13.509

That was so before the women's movement

She set the standard.
She set the way for many people.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.381
She came with all the tools.

19:34.464 --> 19:39.678
She knew everything about production.

19:39.761 --> 19:44.308
She was able to discuss
any aspect of the script

19:44.391 --> 19:46.476

<i>They learn so much just watching her,</i>
<i>doing a scene with her.</i>

21:12.688 --> 21:13.647
[man] Action.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.732
Here, I brought you some chocolates.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.901
[all laugh]

21:18.110 --> 21:20.028
Thank God, he's still jacked!

21:20.112 --> 21:22.155
[all laugh]

21:23.699 --> 21:28.078
[Sullivan] <i>When you think about</i>
<i>what makes a great ensemble actress,</i>

21:28.161 --> 21:31.456
it's someone who can leave
their ego at the door,

21:32.165 --> 21:34.418
and it's someone who is always there

21:34.501 --> 21:37.921
in support of the other actress or actor.

21:39.089 --> 21:42.175
[White]<i> One Saturday morning,</i>
<i>the phone rang, and it was Mary.</i>

21:42.259 --> 21:44.761
She said, "Would you do
a guest shot on my show?"

21:45.053 --> 21:49.725
Of course, she had to coax,
as you can imagine.

21:49.808 --> 21:52.602
Oh, God, she was just so innately funny

21:52.686 --> 21:55.981
and so full and rich
in everything she did.

21:56.064 --> 21:59.234
She had so much energy inside her,

21:59.318 --> 22:04.406
and she just jumped into any scene
that she was put in.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.659
[laughing] Of course.

22:09.202 --> 22:11.621
Somebody forgot to plug in the oven.

22:13.248 --> 22:15.083
Well, I guess that just goes to show

22:15.167 --> 22:16.793
that anybody can make a mistake,

22:16.877 --> 22:18.628
even your Happy Homemaker.

22:19.212 --> 22:20.547
Now, don't you go away.

22:20.630 --> 22:23.759
We'll be right back
after this commercial message.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.510
-[man] All clear.
-All right.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.596
Who the hell is responsible for this?

22:28.555 --> 22:32.309
Sue Ann Nivens was--
She was the Happy Homemaker.

22:32.392 --> 22:34.895
She had a television show.

22:35.103 --> 22:39.191
She could do anything in the kitchen,
I mean, anything--

22:39.274 --> 22:42.152
She was just the master of everything

22:42.235 --> 22:44.571
in the homemaking department.

22:44.654 --> 22:47.074
Do try a little iodine
for that scratch on the desk,

22:47.157 --> 22:48.366
and baking soda will bring

22:48.450 --> 22:50.035
that grease up out of the carpet
like nothing.

22:50.118 --> 22:53.205
Oh, dear, dear, don't throw away
those coffee grounds.

22:53.288 --> 22:55.457
They're the perfect plant food
for Mary's geraniums.

22:55.540 --> 22:59.127
When Val left as Rhoda,
when Betty came in,

22:59.211 --> 23:00.837
there was a whole new relationship

23:00.921 --> 23:04.382
for Mary and Sue Ann Nivens
that really worked.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.843
Sometimes I think I drive myself too hard,

23:07.052 --> 23:09.638
but there's so much to be done
with so little--

23:09.721 --> 23:10.764
Talent.

23:12.349 --> 23:13.683
So little time.

23:13.767 --> 23:16.561
After all, life is so brief
and impermanent,

23:16.645 --> 23:18.021
much like your hair.

23:19.606 --> 23:22.776
Sue Ann, I was able to show another side

23:22.859 --> 23:27.739
that was kind of fun
and a little lecherous, a little mean.

23:27.823 --> 23:30.033
Oh, she emasculated Murray
on that one show

23:30.117 --> 23:31.743
if you saw that about marriage.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.328
He had to wear a dress.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.288
This is embarrassing.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.374
I mean, it's humiliating.

23:37.457 --> 23:39.084
Look, I told you I've got a lunch date.

23:39.167 --> 23:41.169
[chuckling] Oh,
you can go to lunch anytime.

23:41.378 --> 23:43.755
How often do you get a chance
to wear a wedding gown?

23:45.757 --> 23:49.302
She can deliver a line like nobody,

23:49.386 --> 23:52.139
and they created that character,

23:52.222 --> 23:54.808
and she did that whole dimples thing.

23:54.891 --> 23:58.895
She also had a little problem
that she liked men,

23:58.979 --> 24:02.107
any men, anybody's men.

24:02.190 --> 24:07.112
She just liked men, and that was sort of

24:07.487 --> 24:09.281
what made the character kind of fun.

24:09.364 --> 24:10.615
You'll have to excuse me.

24:10.699 --> 24:11.992
I promised Georgette

24:12.075 --> 24:14.327
-that I would select the wine for dinner.
-Oh, sure.

24:14.411 --> 24:16.580
Oh, incidentally, Mr. Van Dillen,

24:16.663 --> 24:18.498
you are the most gorgeous hunk of flesh

24:18.582 --> 24:19.958
I have ever seen.

24:23.461 --> 24:25.213
You value that writing.

24:25.297 --> 24:26.798
You never take it for granted

24:26.882 --> 24:28.675
because it doesn't happen that often.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.011
Mary, this is a marvelous party,

24:31.094 --> 24:33.680
and the cheese puffs are delicious.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.682
Sue Ann, you made the cheese puffs.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.518
[laughing] Oh, did I?

24:40.312 --> 24:42.355
My memory must be beclouded

24:42.439 --> 24:45.108
by this mediocre
little off-year champagne.

24:46.860 --> 24:49.696
The show was written so brilliantly

24:49.779 --> 24:52.616
that everybody had their time to shine.

24:52.782 --> 24:54.993
Anybody like an hors d'oeuvre?

24:55.243 --> 24:57.454
I wouldn't recommend the cheese puffs.

24:58.622 --> 24:59.873
People keep tasting them

24:59.956 --> 25:01.791
and then putting them in the ashtray.

25:04.377 --> 25:06.671
When writing is really good

25:06.755 --> 25:09.466
like it was on <i>Mary Tyler Moore,</i>

25:09.549 --> 25:12.344
it's so much more interesting
to the audience

25:12.427 --> 25:15.513
to find the backgrounds
of all the different characters.

25:15.597 --> 25:18.266
They discover that she had this...

25:18.350 --> 25:20.727
like, a triple king-size bed.

25:23.813 --> 25:27.484
Sue Ann, you remember Ted
from the newsroom?

25:28.652 --> 25:29.861
Of course.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.613
How have you been, Ted?

25:31.863 --> 25:34.074
Oh, swell, swell, Sue Ann.

25:34.157 --> 25:36.117
All of a sudden, Ted is there

25:36.201 --> 25:38.036
straightening his tie in the ceiling.

25:39.621 --> 25:40.747
Whoa.

25:41.581 --> 25:44.584
What a great bedroom, Sue Ann.

25:47.128 --> 25:48.838
[imperceptible]

25:55.011 --> 25:59.599
So, you know the whole thing
is mirrored up there. [laughs]

25:59.933 --> 26:00.976
It was funny.

26:01.142 --> 26:03.270
You had to tune in week to week, you know,

26:03.353 --> 26:04.854
to see what everybody was gonna do,

26:04.938 --> 26:06.856
and she created some of those characters

26:06.940 --> 26:09.985
where you always wanted to see
what Sue Ann was gonna do

26:10.068 --> 26:11.361
or what Rose was gonna do.

26:11.736 --> 26:14.322
Were you shocked
when they said, "Now, Betty,

26:14.406 --> 26:16.491
we've got this wonderful series for you.

26:16.574 --> 26:18.827
We want you to be
one of the Golden Girls."

26:19.286 --> 26:20.787
-Did you--
-Well, all I was thinking,

26:20.870 --> 26:22.622
all that time in makeup, you know,

26:22.706 --> 26:24.374
trying to put on the age makeup
and everything, but--

26:24.457 --> 26:27.502
-I know, isn't that--
-[all laughing]

26:30.505 --> 26:32.632
Betty White was one of the few people

26:32.716 --> 26:35.302
who walks into the room, and you know her.

26:35.385 --> 26:37.887
You've known her all your life
for some reason.

26:37.971 --> 26:41.808
She's one of those people
always welcome to any show she's in,

26:41.891 --> 26:44.144
from <i>The Golden Girls</i> to--

26:44.227 --> 26:48.732
She's just one of those people,
and she's funny.

26:48.815 --> 26:51.901
I'll never forget the time they sang
at our annual talent show

26:51.985 --> 26:53.778
right after the herring juggling act.

26:54.696 --> 26:55.947
You mean to tell me

26:56.031 --> 26:58.575
that somebody actually juggled herring?

26:58.700 --> 27:00.201
No!

27:00.452 --> 27:02.662
It was the <i>herring</i> who did the juggling.

27:04.914 --> 27:06.499
Tiny little Ginsu knives.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.878
Really very dangerous.

27:09.961 --> 27:12.589
I mean, one false move,
they could've filleted themselves.

27:14.841 --> 27:18.094
Growing up, uh, Betty White
made me want to live in Florida,

27:18.178 --> 27:19.888
watching <i>The Golden Girls.</i>

27:19.971 --> 27:24.225
I've always loved, loved <i>The Golden Girls,</i>

27:24.309 --> 27:28.021
and, you know, it was one of
the staple sitcoms when I was a kid,

27:28.104 --> 27:30.273
and it was something
that I was sort of raised with,

27:30.357 --> 27:32.400
and I loved that gang.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.569
I think I spent probably from the time

27:34.652 --> 27:37.447
that I was about
six years old, seven years old,

27:37.530 --> 27:39.240
watching <i>The Golden Girls</i>
with my grandmother,

27:39.324 --> 27:41.493
and so, you know, I felt like Betty

27:41.576 --> 27:43.953
sort of grew up with me in some weird way.

27:44.037 --> 27:48.625
Rose, is this another one of those
Scandinavian Viking concoctions?

27:48.708 --> 27:49.793
Yes!

27:50.877 --> 27:52.962
It's called genuckenflugen cake.

27:55.965 --> 27:59.302
It's an ancient recipe,
but I Americanized it.

27:59.386 --> 28:01.596
Yeah, so one might say
you brought geflurkenurken

28:01.679 --> 28:03.098
into the '80s?

28:04.599 --> 28:08.228
Yes, but I'm not one
to blow my own vetubenflugen.

28:10.271 --> 28:12.774
And I fell in love with her. I loved Rose.

28:12.857 --> 28:15.151
Rose didn't have a mean bone in her body.

28:15.235 --> 28:18.655
<i>Golden Girls,</i> like, you know,
any other great, epic,

28:18.738 --> 28:22.409
iconic show or film,
is a love story, you know?

28:22.492 --> 28:25.203
And it's a love story between
these four elderly ladies

28:25.286 --> 28:28.331
living in Florida, and they've all,
lived their lives to the fullest,

28:28.415 --> 28:31.918
and they continue to do so,
and they do it as a love story.

28:32.001 --> 28:33.294
Four points of a compass.

28:33.378 --> 28:38.800
There was Rue,
who was the beautiful, sexy.

28:38.883 --> 28:41.010
Rose, what was your
first impression of me?

28:42.512 --> 28:44.931
I thought you wore too much makeup
and were a slut.

28:45.014 --> 28:46.099
[chuckles]

28:51.855 --> 28:54.607
I was wrong.
You don't wear too much makeup.

28:56.317 --> 28:59.821
Bea Arthur was the tall, strong,

28:59.904 --> 29:03.158
not always easy character.

29:03.450 --> 29:05.493
-Spanish fly is not a fly?
-No.

29:05.577 --> 29:06.745
-What is it?
-It's a beetle.

29:07.162 --> 29:08.872
They call it a fly,
but it's really a beetle?

29:08.955 --> 29:11.207
-Yes.
-How do they know it's Spanish?

29:11.499 --> 29:13.835
Because it wears a little sombrero, Rose.

29:14.961 --> 29:19.841
And Estelle Getty,
the older woman who was a dynamite.

29:19.924 --> 29:22.802
-You're awfully cranky today.
-Well, forgive me.

29:22.886 --> 29:24.387
My arthritis is bothering me.

29:24.471 --> 29:26.598
My Social Security check was late,

29:26.681 --> 29:29.934
and I realized today I haven't
showered with a man in 22 years.

29:31.519 --> 29:34.063
The writers were so phenomenal.

29:34.147 --> 29:37.609
They blended those characters together

29:37.692 --> 29:41.488
and rounded the edges off,
so we all fit like that.

29:41.571 --> 29:46.159
Those girls were so talented
at just simply flashing a look

29:46.284 --> 29:49.078
that would ride a wave of laughter
off to the next look.

29:49.412 --> 29:53.666
I mean, Stan and I went through a period
where we had no marital relations at all.

29:53.958 --> 29:55.960
I totally cut off his sex.

29:56.252 --> 29:57.587
You mean it grows back?

30:03.760 --> 30:05.512
And then it would ride
another wave of laughter

30:05.595 --> 30:08.223
when, you know,
Rue would look at someone else,

30:08.306 --> 30:10.099
and then Betty would look at,
you know, Bea.

30:20.276 --> 30:22.070
Yes, Rose, he's a lizard.

30:24.447 --> 30:25.782
The scripts were incredibly short

30:25.865 --> 30:27.617
because they were so packed with laughter

30:27.700 --> 30:29.285
just simply from their looks.

30:29.536 --> 30:31.454
So that, to me, is just pure talent.

30:31.538 --> 30:32.705
They were letting people in

30:32.789 --> 30:34.666
on what older women were talking about.

30:34.749 --> 30:37.710
We weren't allow to come
to those coffee klatches.

30:37.794 --> 30:38.962
They'd put it on the air.

30:39.045 --> 30:40.713
I said, "Oh, that's what they talk about."

30:40.797 --> 30:43.174
It's about life,
and we'd talk about real life.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.259
Who's not interested?

30:47.804 --> 30:49.681
She comes here. She sits down.

30:49.764 --> 30:51.975
We have a little caviar.
We have a little drink,

30:52.058 --> 30:54.811
and we talk about what happened
over the week.

30:54.894 --> 30:56.145
[both laughing]

30:57.522 --> 30:58.982
[man] Here we go.

30:59.065 --> 31:02.193
[Martin] <i>But then, suddenly,</i>
<i>I feel her getting edgy.</i>

31:02.277 --> 31:04.153
<i>She wants to get to the table.</i>

31:05.405 --> 31:09.200
<i>She is ruthless,</i>
<i>let me tell you, ruthless.</i>

31:09.284 --> 31:11.786
Six, seven...

31:11.870 --> 31:14.247
She always says,
"Well, I know we're friends here,

31:14.330 --> 31:18.334
but when we get over there,
all friendships cease,"

31:18.751 --> 31:21.212
<i>and she means it. </i>[laughs]

31:21.296 --> 31:24.424
<i>And I have to tell you,</i>
<i>she beats us most of the time.</i>

31:24.507 --> 31:26.968
You can see what a friendly game it is.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.431
We were such nice friends over there.

31:31.514 --> 31:33.474
[Martin] <i>Betty is a crossword lover.</i>

31:33.558 --> 31:36.477
<i>She's an all-word-game lover</i>
<i>as with </i>Password

31:36.561 --> 31:38.813
<i>and </i>$25,000 Pyramid<i> and that.</i>

31:39.063 --> 31:42.358
She loves words and creating words.

31:42.692 --> 31:44.777
-Oh, boy.
-I'll add an "S".

31:44.861 --> 31:47.071
Oh, what a surprise.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.823
[laughs]

31:48.907 --> 31:50.617
One, two, three.

31:50.783 --> 31:52.452
She loves playing games.

31:52.535 --> 31:53.828
Games are her life.

31:54.621 --> 31:56.205
-Child.
-Minor.

31:56.289 --> 31:57.624
Minor, right.

31:58.833 --> 32:02.003
She enjoys the excitement.

32:02.337 --> 32:04.339
She enjoys the competition.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.591
[man] What do you think the answer
to the puzzle is?

32:06.674 --> 32:08.509
-Penguin.
-Is it a penguin?

32:08.593 --> 32:10.428
-It's a penguin!
-Oh!

32:10.511 --> 32:12.513
-Oh, that's wonderful.
-[audience applauding]

32:12.722 --> 32:14.599
-Oh, that's lovely.
-Okay.

32:14.682 --> 32:17.310
She's witty, and she's quick,

32:18.144 --> 32:22.482
and those two are great qualities to have

32:22.565 --> 32:27.070
if you're going to appear
as a celebrity guest on game shows.

32:27.153 --> 32:28.613
-[bell dings]
-All right, Dolores.

32:28.696 --> 32:30.365
Give us the answer that she's given.

32:30.448 --> 32:33.952
We give you $5,000. Sacred.

32:34.369 --> 32:36.955
I hope it comes through for me
this time... Sacred heart.

32:37.246 --> 32:38.748
[man] Sacred heart.

32:38.831 --> 32:40.458
[applauding]

32:40.875 --> 32:42.460
Well, we're gonna find out
if it comes through

32:42.543 --> 32:44.420
for you or not, Dolores.

32:44.504 --> 32:47.090
Betty, she says "sacred heart"
will match you for the $5,000.

32:47.173 --> 32:48.299
What do you say?

32:48.383 --> 32:50.259
But you also make a sacred vow,
don't you...

32:50.343 --> 32:51.803
-[man] A sacred vow.
-...with all your heart!

32:51.886 --> 32:53.012
[man] With all your heart!

32:53.096 --> 32:55.098
[cheering and applauding]

32:58.017 --> 32:59.852
[Trebek] <i>Betty White hosted her own show,</i>

32:59.936 --> 33:04.691
<i>the only woman to have</i>
<i>won an Emmy for hosting a game show.</i>

33:04.857 --> 33:08.945
<i>Her qualities have really helped her</i>
<i>throughout her career,</i>

33:09.278 --> 33:13.658
and she's fast enough
to handle any situation that comes up.

33:14.075 --> 33:18.913
[man] Yes, it's <i>Password,</i> and now,
here's your host on <i>Password,</i>

33:18.997 --> 33:20.456
Allen Ludden.

33:23.751 --> 33:26.045
[Sullivan] <i>Allen Ludden</i>
<i>was the game-show maven,</i>

33:26.129 --> 33:27.714
and along with Bob Stewart,

33:27.797 --> 33:31.676
one of the great game producers
in television history,

33:32.176 --> 33:33.594
they came up with <i>Password.</i>

33:33.803 --> 33:36.639
The more games you win,
the more money you win.

33:36.723 --> 33:37.557
Isn't that great?

33:37.932 --> 33:41.310
[Bob Stewart] <i>Allen was</i>
<i>a wonderfully neutral guy</i>

33:41.394 --> 33:43.229
<i>rooting for both teams.</i>

33:43.312 --> 33:45.773
You would never know from watching him

33:45.857 --> 33:50.987
that he wasn't enthusiastically
hoping everybody was perfect.

33:51.070 --> 33:53.239
So he worked out to be a pretty good guy.

33:53.322 --> 33:57.035
I met this lady on this show in 1961.

33:57.118 --> 33:58.494
First time I ever met Betty was right here

33:58.578 --> 33:59.620
doing <i>Password</i> in 1961.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.539
-Marvelous. What a nice thing.
-[all applauding]

34:02.582 --> 34:03.750
[man] 17 years.

34:03.833 --> 34:06.169
[Ludden] Yeah, that was...

34:06.252 --> 34:08.254
-In '61 is 18 years.
-[man] Wow, 18.

34:08.337 --> 34:10.006
Yeah, we've been married how many?

34:10.089 --> 34:12.341
Something like three, four, something.

34:12.425 --> 34:16.554
They met on <i>Password,</i> Betty and Allen,

34:16.637 --> 34:17.764
and they looked at each other.

34:17.847 --> 34:20.850
They said, "This is it,"
and it was a love affair.

34:20.933 --> 34:23.895
I flew to New York to do
a couple of things,

34:23.978 --> 34:26.814
and <i>Password </i>was one of them,
and I fell in love with the game.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.441
I loved the game of <i>Password.</i>

34:28.524 --> 34:30.193
[man] This is the sparkling
television star

34:30.276 --> 34:32.361
and great <i>Password</i> player, Betty White.

34:32.653 --> 34:39.160
The host was very nice and very attractive
and I thought, "Oh." [giggles]

34:39.410 --> 34:41.829
Hello, Allen. [laughs]

34:42.163 --> 34:44.207
[Ludden] What are your plans
for the summer, Betty?

34:44.290 --> 34:45.917
Well, I'm gonna do some-- [laughs]

34:46.000 --> 34:48.711
-What did you have in mind, Allen?
-[all laugh]

34:49.128 --> 34:51.297
I think that's one of the reasons

34:51.380 --> 34:55.802
why she came in and out of New York

34:55.885 --> 34:57.720
for short periods of time

34:58.679 --> 35:02.433
to do <i>"Password"</i> or something, you know?

35:02.642 --> 35:07.522
So there was some kind of spark
going on early. [laughs]

35:07.730 --> 35:10.608
There was just a rapport and a warmth.

35:11.109 --> 35:14.487
We just kind of-- We dug each other a lot.

35:14.695 --> 35:17.198
His whole view of how to deal with Betty

35:17.281 --> 35:21.410
<i>was to constantly send her notes,</i>
<i>to constantly woo her.</i>

35:21.494 --> 35:25.081
By the end of the year,
he wouldn't say, "Hello."

35:25.164 --> 35:26.374
He'd say, "Will you marry me?"

35:26.457 --> 35:28.209
Well, I thought that was such a joke.

35:28.292 --> 35:29.460
I mean, that's ridiculous.

35:31.838 --> 35:35.424
<i>One night, we went to dinner,</i>
<i>and he gave me a jewelry box,</i>

35:35.508 --> 35:37.093
and I opened it,
and there's a wedding ring,

35:37.176 --> 35:39.846
a lovely wedding ring
with diamonds all the way around.

35:40.471 --> 35:42.890
He says, "You might as well wear it.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.059
You're gonna say yes sooner or later."

35:45.977 --> 35:48.187
Well, as any red-blooded American girl
would do,

35:48.271 --> 35:49.397
I got mad.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.024
I got furious, and I gave it back to him,
and I said,

35:52.108 --> 35:55.528
"Forget it, and stop pushing me.
I'm not interested."

35:55.611 --> 35:56.904
I lived in California.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.157
There was no way I was
gonna move to New York.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.534
And he was constantly presenting it,

36:01.617 --> 36:03.494
and she was constantly rejecting it.

36:03.578 --> 36:05.079
Did he give it back to the jeweler?

36:05.163 --> 36:08.583
No, he put it on a chain around his neck.

36:08.791 --> 36:10.376
<i>We'd go to the beach.</i>

36:10.459 --> 36:11.502
<i>There's the wedding ring.</i>

36:11.586 --> 36:13.921
<i>You'd see it at all times. "Here it is."</i>

36:14.922 --> 36:17.675
So in my idiocy,

36:17.758 --> 36:19.969
I wasted a whole year
we could have been together.

36:20.344 --> 36:21.679
I'd say, "No."

36:21.971 --> 36:25.266
She hates the fact that she held him off
for a year and a half

36:25.349 --> 36:27.393
because she didn't want
to move to New York,

36:27.476 --> 36:29.312
and she didn't know
if she could be a mother

36:29.395 --> 36:31.355
to three young people.

36:31.981 --> 36:35.735
Uh... She says today--
If you ask her, she'll say,

36:35.818 --> 36:39.363
"I lost all that time.
I lost all that time."

36:39.906 --> 36:42.950
And, finally, Easter came along,

36:43.034 --> 36:46.329
and he sent me this beautiful
little stuffed bunny

36:46.412 --> 36:52.543
with ruby and sapphire
and gold earrings on its ears,

36:53.211 --> 36:56.088
and it just said, "Please say yes."

36:56.380 --> 37:00.009
So that night when he called me,
I didn't say, "Hello."

37:00.092 --> 37:04.347
I said, "Yes," and always
after that, he said,

37:04.430 --> 37:08.267
"Betty is the only woman
I ever could imagine--

37:08.351 --> 37:11.187
She didn't say yes to me
because of those earrings."

37:11.354 --> 37:15.441
It was because of that soft bunny...
[laughing] ...that I said yes.

37:17.151 --> 37:18.653
<i>It had suddenly dawned on me</i>

37:18.736 --> 37:20.613
<i>I was gonna spend the rest of my life</i>

37:20.696 --> 37:23.574
without him because of my stubbornness,

37:23.658 --> 37:25.701
so sure enough, we got married,

37:25.785 --> 37:28.120
and I moved to New York for four years,

37:28.913 --> 37:32.458
and then Goodson-Todman moved
<i>Password</i> back to California,

37:32.541 --> 37:33.876
and life was wonderful.

37:34.335 --> 37:35.795
This is my wife, Betty, Mr. Unger.

37:35.878 --> 37:36.963
Felix.

37:37.046 --> 37:40.508
Nice to know you, Mrs. White...
Ms. White, Ms. Ludden.

37:40.591 --> 37:42.134
-Betty.
-Ah.

37:42.218 --> 37:45.221
You know, I watch you all the time, Betty.
You're my biggest fan.

37:48.557 --> 37:49.600
Thank you. That's very nice.

37:49.684 --> 37:51.477
I remember when you had your own show

37:51.560 --> 37:53.729
years and years and years ago.

37:56.941 --> 37:57.942
That many?

37:58.526 --> 37:59.902
It's amazing how youthful you look.

38:01.320 --> 38:02.446
Thank you.

38:02.530 --> 38:04.031
I'm even younger on the reruns.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.409
[laughs]

38:06.492 --> 38:08.119
She had the greatest marriage.

38:08.202 --> 38:12.540
Allen Ludden, her darling husband,
died quite many years ago.

38:12.623 --> 38:14.917
I didn't know how she would do
after Allen passed away,

38:15.001 --> 38:17.211
but she's strong.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.380
She got through that, and look at her.

38:19.463 --> 38:24.468
There was an aura
that surrounded how they were

38:24.552 --> 38:26.095
<i>that I'll never forget.</i>

38:27.930 --> 38:29.598
Once it happens,

38:29.682 --> 38:32.727
it's not something you make up
or you make room for.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.103
You can't avoid it.

38:34.186 --> 38:36.897
You can't get away from it,
and you don't want to.

38:38.649 --> 38:40.776
<i>We were kind of hung up on each other.</i>

38:40.860 --> 38:43.696
We, uh... We had a crush on each other.

38:47.533 --> 38:50.244
-Nice to have had you here.
-Nice to have had you here.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.829
-You played a very good game.
-Thank you.

38:51.912 --> 38:53.664
-We'll see you all next week...
-It's been fun with this one.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.124
...at the same time or tomorrow
on daytime <i>Password.</i>

38:55.207 --> 38:57.877
Until then, this is Allen Ludden
saying the password tonight is...

38:57.960 --> 38:58.836
Home.

38:58.919 --> 39:01.255
Will you take me home, please, Mr. Ludden?

39:01.339 --> 39:02.673
I certainly will, Mrs. Ludden.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.467
-Thank you. Good night.
-[audience applaud]

39:06.761 --> 39:08.888
[Mikelas] I can put the addresses
on the envelopes

39:08.971 --> 39:10.890
'cause I have them all here
in my phone, so you don't--

39:10.973 --> 39:12.892
If you write the notes
and hand them to me,

39:12.975 --> 39:14.977
then I can get everything addressed, and--

39:15.061 --> 39:18.522
She is the most hands-on person,

39:18.606 --> 39:22.193
in terms of that professional stuff

39:22.276 --> 39:23.569
that I've ever worked for.

39:24.278 --> 39:25.821
<i>She reads her fan mail.</i>

39:25.905 --> 39:27.531
<i>She signs her own fan mail.</i>

39:27.615 --> 39:29.909
<i>She still writes letters to Eagle Scouts.</i>

39:30.534 --> 39:32.495
Why my hand is--

39:32.578 --> 39:34.038
It doesn't look like my writing.

39:34.163 --> 39:35.706
My hand doesn't know how to work.

39:35.790 --> 39:39.293
-Let's take a look.
-Thank you.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.378
Oh, it's still that--

39:40.461 --> 39:42.671
it's still the pretty Betty handwriting.

39:42.755 --> 39:45.925
I have not encountered anybody
with a work ethic

39:46.008 --> 39:48.719
like Betty's in my career.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.888
I mean, she makes you want to work harder.

39:50.971 --> 39:52.306
She makes you want to show up.

39:52.515 --> 39:55.726
Okay, we're gonna do some schedule first
because I want to make sure

39:55.810 --> 39:58.062
that you have everything
up-to-date that I have.

39:58.145 --> 39:59.772
Okeydoke, sweetheart.

40:00.314 --> 40:01.982
[Mikelas] <i>She wants that schedule full.</i>

40:02.108 --> 40:03.401
She loves to work.

40:03.776 --> 40:05.111
She loves to be busy.

40:05.486 --> 40:09.031
And then, pickup for the salon
at 7:00 on Friday.

40:09.115 --> 40:11.659
-Yes.
-And Fleming at 11:00 for body.

40:11.742 --> 40:15.746
Right. On Wednesday...

40:15.830 --> 40:18.332
Pickup at 6:15 for <i>Hot in Cleveland.</i>

40:18.416 --> 40:20.918
Yeah, you're gonna have dinner
with the <i>Hot in Cleveland </i>ladies.

40:21.001 --> 40:22.711
-The ladies, uh-huh.
-That will be nice to see them

40:22.795 --> 40:24.380
'cause you haven't seen them in a while.

40:24.463 --> 40:27.633
-Yeah. No, it's been quite a while.
-Yeah.

40:27.716 --> 40:31.095
<i>Hot in Cleveland </i>was a gift from--

40:31.178 --> 40:33.722
I must have been doing
something right in my life

40:33.806 --> 40:36.725
because I was given this gift
right on my lap,

40:36.809 --> 40:40.271
um, and when they said, "Read the script.
We have Betty White,"

40:40.354 --> 40:42.648
I was like,
"Oh, I don't even have to read it.

40:42.731 --> 40:44.275
Yeah, I want to work with Betty White."

40:44.567 --> 40:50.656
They asked me if I'd do a guest shot,
and I said,

40:50.739 --> 40:52.366
"Well, if--" It was the pilot,

40:52.450 --> 40:57.872
"and if it gets picked up,
and how few shows get picked up,"

40:58.164 --> 41:00.207
I said, "I won't be able to do the show.

41:00.291 --> 41:03.377
I'm too busy, but I can do--

41:03.461 --> 41:05.296
I'll do a one-shot on the pilot."

41:05.379 --> 41:06.964
So what are you, like 100?

41:08.591 --> 41:10.092
I don't like you.

41:12.094 --> 41:13.888
Aren't you that girl from that show?

41:13.971 --> 41:15.181
Yes, yes, I am.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.183
-Are you a fan?
-No.

41:20.019 --> 41:22.229
When it was canceled,
I said, "Good riddance."

41:23.314 --> 41:26.358
Luckily, after the pilot was done,

41:26.442 --> 41:29.695
Betty seemed to have had
such an amazing time that she said,

41:29.778 --> 41:31.322
"Oh, yeah, sure, I'll be in."

41:31.405 --> 41:34.116
They never were able
to get rid of me. [laughs]

41:34.200 --> 41:35.993
They couldn't lose me from then on.

41:36.285 --> 41:39.955
You know, Joy,
instead of two weeks in Paris,

41:40.039 --> 41:42.041
we could spend two weeks in Cleveland.

41:42.124 --> 41:44.168
I mean, the Paris of Ohio.

41:45.586 --> 41:46.879
No, that's Toledo.

41:50.049 --> 41:52.718
There is no other way
to work except in an ensemble.

41:52.801 --> 41:55.513
I think you feed off each other--

41:55.596 --> 41:57.348
No, I <i>know</i> you feed off each other.

41:57.431 --> 42:00.559
It raises your own game,
and I'm telling you,

42:00.643 --> 42:03.604
working with Betty White
is really like having

42:03.687 --> 42:05.856
a master class of comedic timing.

42:05.940 --> 42:08.692
So, we're four single girls
on a Saturday night.

42:08.776 --> 42:10.027
[dings]

42:10.402 --> 42:12.655
-Victoria!
-Wait, that's not me!

42:12.947 --> 42:13.989
It's me.

42:14.490 --> 42:16.659
I signed up when my bender was over.

42:17.076 --> 42:20.246
In fact, that's my screen name...
BenderOver.

42:26.377 --> 42:27.503
[chuckles]

42:27.586 --> 42:29.672
So we call it the "BenderOver scene,"

42:30.214 --> 42:33.509
and to this day,

42:33.592 --> 42:38.222
I cannot watch "BenderOver"
without laughing hysterically.

42:38.639 --> 42:41.058
I signed up when my bender was over.

42:41.183 --> 42:43.894
[all laughing]

42:44.478 --> 42:45.771
Oh, I am so sorry.

42:45.896 --> 42:48.691
It just gives you the giggles
because Betty White has the giggles,

42:48.774 --> 42:52.152
and when Betty White has the giggles,
I defy you.

42:52.236 --> 42:55.114
There is no way
that you cannot giggle yourself.

42:55.197 --> 42:57.992
I signed up when my bender was over.

42:58.075 --> 42:59.451
[all laughing]

42:59.868 --> 43:02.037
Hang on. I'm gonna do it.

43:03.038 --> 43:05.040
Not this, but--

43:05.708 --> 43:08.002
I signed up when my bender was over.

43:08.294 --> 43:10.921
In fact, that's my screen name...

43:11.005 --> 43:12.548
[laughing] "BenderOver."

43:16.010 --> 43:18.137
We had a few during the years,

43:18.220 --> 43:21.473
a few really amazing moments

43:21.557 --> 43:24.435
where everything stopped on the set,

43:24.518 --> 43:27.813
and people just wanted to watch
Betty work with Tim Conway.

43:27.980 --> 43:31.442
I believe you left this behind
at the dance, princess.

43:32.484 --> 43:35.362
Well, I had to rush off
when the clock struck 9:00.

43:35.446 --> 43:36.614
Yes.

43:36.697 --> 43:38.365
Betty worked with Carol Burnett.

43:38.782 --> 43:43.287
Oh, Elka, I am so glad
we had this time together.

43:44.246 --> 43:46.165
Me too. [giggles]

43:46.415 --> 43:49.793
Betty worked with her old
<i>Mary Tyler Moore</i> crew.

43:50.085 --> 43:54.214
So to have those people
come into this new family,

43:54.298 --> 43:57.384
it was an interesting and delightful week.

43:57.468 --> 43:58.969
You were the bombshell.

43:59.053 --> 44:02.723
Diane was the legs,
and Mamie Sue was the ditz.

44:04.183 --> 44:06.185
No, no, no, I was the legs.

44:07.519 --> 44:13.359
Angie was the brains,
and Mamie Sue was the... ditz.

44:15.110 --> 44:17.196
Well, the joke's on all of you.

44:17.279 --> 44:20.574
You're not any of those things anymore,
but I'm still ditzy.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.159
[all laugh]

44:23.827 --> 44:25.621
[Engel] <i>The memory I take away from that</i>

44:25.704 --> 44:28.082
is the mortal changes happen,

44:28.165 --> 44:33.003
but our love for each other endures.

44:33.629 --> 44:36.590
The first time I was just speechless,

44:36.674 --> 44:40.969
which is hard for me, was when
Carl Reiner came on the show.

44:41.053 --> 44:42.680
Betty and I worked on--

44:42.763 --> 44:45.057
I worked on her show called
<i>Hot in Cleveland.</i>

44:45.140 --> 44:49.311
Oh, well, well, Carl is something else.

44:49.603 --> 44:52.856
And there was a scene in an outdoor patio,

44:52.940 --> 44:55.442
and Carl and Betty
are getting to know one another,

44:55.526 --> 44:57.694
and they just riffed off each other

44:57.778 --> 45:01.281
like no one else was in the room,
and they were brilliant.

45:01.573 --> 45:04.493
The truth is, I'm a great driver,

45:04.576 --> 45:07.663
but sometimes I like to drive real slow

45:07.746 --> 45:09.206
just to mess with people.

45:09.289 --> 45:10.791
[both laugh]

45:12.418 --> 45:14.670
I am having such a good time.

45:15.337 --> 45:16.338
Me too.

45:16.422 --> 45:17.589
It was so perfect.

45:17.673 --> 45:20.926
When I saw it, I said,
"That is a symbiotic scene.

45:21.009 --> 45:22.469
That couple belonged together."

45:23.053 --> 45:24.596
I think we should get married.

45:25.597 --> 45:26.640
Me too.

45:27.474 --> 45:28.851
Pass the salt.

45:29.435 --> 45:31.395
Really? You'd marry me?

45:31.854 --> 45:33.147
Yeah, I would.

45:33.772 --> 45:35.482
Why dance around?

45:35.566 --> 45:36.984
We're perfect for each other.

45:38.235 --> 45:42.072
I'm glad to hear that.
Oh, here's your salt.

45:43.073 --> 45:44.992
I'm impressed you can still use that.

45:45.701 --> 45:48.078
Oh, I know how to shake what I've got.

45:53.917 --> 45:56.253
I've been wanting to do that all night.

45:58.130 --> 45:59.089
[softly] Well...

45:59.256 --> 46:01.341
Now, I can get back to my rigatoni.

46:03.469 --> 46:06.096
He sinks right into the moment,

46:06.180 --> 46:08.891
and whatever you throw at him,

46:08.974 --> 46:11.852
he throws right back at you,
and you better be ready.

46:12.394 --> 46:14.104
It's-- Oh, he's a joy.

46:14.855 --> 46:17.107
If you're an actor in this town

46:17.191 --> 46:20.986
and you get a chance up close
to see these people work together

46:21.069 --> 46:23.989
and not make it look like work, it was--

46:24.072 --> 46:25.491
I'm getting chills just thinking about it

46:25.574 --> 46:28.118
because I can't imagine

46:28.202 --> 46:30.370
how I got lucky enough
to be a part of this.

46:30.621 --> 46:33.123
-So this is my gammy, Annie.
-Pleasure.

46:33.207 --> 46:35.459
Well, hello, there. [chuckles]

46:35.542 --> 46:40.088
Now, do you prefer being called
Margaret or Satan's Mistress?

46:41.006 --> 46:43.050
She is, again,

46:43.133 --> 46:46.595
this sweet sort of lovable character
with an edge,

46:46.678 --> 46:49.097
and we exploited that edge

46:49.181 --> 46:51.517
over and over and over again on that film.
She's a rascal.

46:51.808 --> 46:54.895
Sorry. I'm a bit chesty to begin with,

46:54.978 --> 46:57.439
and I happened to be
knocked up when I wore this.

46:57.523 --> 46:59.024
-Oh.
-[all giggling]

46:59.107 --> 47:02.152
Oh, let's see if we can find your boobs.

47:02.569 --> 47:04.488
[Reynolds] <i>Betty really</i>
<i>just made that movie.</i>

47:04.571 --> 47:07.115
I really don't think that
that film would have been nearly

47:07.199 --> 47:09.535
as successful or as effective
without her presence.

47:09.618 --> 47:11.495
This is like an Easter egg hunt.
[chuckles]

47:12.788 --> 47:15.499
Maybe they shrunk up
in the cold Alaskan air.

47:15.582 --> 47:17.167
[all laugh]

47:18.001 --> 47:20.921
-Oh, there they are.
-That-- Yes, it would be.

47:21.004 --> 47:22.047
Oh.

47:22.130 --> 47:26.927
She's just this sweet,
you know, lovely older woman

47:27.010 --> 47:30.097
who is just beloved
by this whole crew and cast

47:30.180 --> 47:31.557
that everybody
would just do anything for her,

47:31.640 --> 47:33.141
and she gets up to leave,

47:33.225 --> 47:35.644
and everyone's sad
'cause it's her last shot,

47:35.727 --> 47:37.271
and she's just walking
out the door to say goodbye,

47:37.354 --> 47:38.981
and she turns around
right in the doorjamb,

47:39.064 --> 47:41.942
and she says,
"I just want everyone here to know

47:42.317 --> 47:46.655
this is the most fun
I've ever had... standing up,"

47:47.698 --> 47:50.450
and then she turns, and, I mean, just--

47:50.534 --> 47:52.494
The woman just kills everyone.

47:52.578 --> 47:54.913
Everybody is just--
spends the rest of the day

47:54.997 --> 47:56.915
at a perfect 90-degree angle laughing.

47:56.999 --> 47:59.209
The crew just loved her, and, I mean,

47:59.293 --> 48:01.211
never forgot a line, never--

48:01.295 --> 48:03.589
I mean, she was just everything

48:03.672 --> 48:05.549
that you wanted her to be and more.

48:05.632 --> 48:07.384
I felt very, very lucky.

48:07.593 --> 48:08.969
Caroline, you okay?

48:09.052 --> 48:11.888
Oh, I am, indeed, and thank you again.

48:11.972 --> 48:13.140
Of course.

48:13.473 --> 48:15.767
Okay, so the train is gonna be here
in just a few minutes,

48:15.851 --> 48:18.604
and they're gonna bring your husband
right through that tunnel.

48:19.771 --> 48:21.773
Caroline, you don't have to do a thing.

48:22.274 --> 48:24.818
Just wait like you always do.

48:25.193 --> 48:28.947
<i>The Lost Valentine</i> is a love letter,

48:29.031 --> 48:31.950
like, a generational love letter.

48:32.034 --> 48:34.620
She really had a connection to the piece

48:34.703 --> 48:37.372
and, you know, very much like myself,

48:37.456 --> 48:39.583
sort of just loved the love story

48:39.666 --> 48:42.961
and has such an amazing love story
with her husband.

48:43.045 --> 48:45.839
In any scene about the husband

48:45.922 --> 48:49.426
or about that character in the movie,
before and after,

48:49.509 --> 48:52.429
she would always send a kiss up to Allen.

48:56.391 --> 49:01.188
The power of how love can stay
for a very, very, very long time

49:01.271 --> 49:03.774
and sort of grab ahold of you
and not let go.

49:11.281 --> 49:12.199
It was really something

49:12.282 --> 49:14.368
that she wanted to not only
give to the audience,

49:14.451 --> 49:17.621
I think that she wanted to prove
to the audience that, you know,

49:17.746 --> 49:19.956
she wasn't funny all the time, you know?
[chuckles]

49:20.040 --> 49:23.043
Um, but I also think for Allen,
it was really--

49:23.126 --> 49:26.338
It was sort of-- that's kind of
where she went in her heart

49:26.421 --> 49:29.216
and her mind, and it was very touching.

49:41.353 --> 49:44.523
[sobbing]

49:47.901 --> 49:49.069
<i>It was very slow.</i>

49:49.152 --> 49:52.989
It was a very sweet, sort of soft moment,

49:53.073 --> 49:55.242
and she was just brilliant.

50:07.003 --> 50:08.422
-Hi, Betty.
-Hi!

50:08.505 --> 50:11.174
-It's so good to see you!
-Oh, thank you.

50:11.258 --> 50:14.010
-So happy you could come up.
-Thank you for letting me come.

50:14.094 --> 50:16.680
We've been telling Bam Bam
all week his BFF is coming.

50:16.763 --> 50:18.306
-[White]<i> Oh, really?</i>
-[woman]<i> Yeah.</i>

50:18.390 --> 50:20.475
[White] <i>Well, that's my life.</i>

50:20.559 --> 50:22.602
The reason I work,
the reason I do anything

50:22.686 --> 50:25.021
is because of my love of animals.

50:25.522 --> 50:27.899
[man] She's enjoying his love right now.

50:27.983 --> 50:29.693
[Engel] <i>She says all the time,</i>

50:29.776 --> 50:31.820
"I have to keep doing my acting job

50:31.903 --> 50:35.490
so I can support
my animal causes." [chuckles]

50:35.657 --> 50:39.035
She truly believes that the animal kingdom

50:39.119 --> 50:41.705
is well worth taking care of.

50:41.997 --> 50:43.874
Well, what is that?

50:43.957 --> 50:45.834
[Dee] <i>And with Betty,</i>
<i>it's been constant,</i>

50:45.917 --> 50:47.669
<i>hundred percent, all the time.</i>

50:47.753 --> 50:49.629
She doesn't call herself an activist.

50:49.713 --> 50:52.758
She's an advocate,
and there's a difference.

50:52.841 --> 50:54.217
How's that?

50:54.301 --> 50:56.928
Is that good? Is that good?

50:57.304 --> 50:59.181
[Sullivan] <i>Let me begin</i>
<i>by telling you that I think</i>

50:59.264 --> 51:04.352
Betty White can charm
the savage beast. [chuckles]

51:06.521 --> 51:10.108
-I'm the luckiest old broad on two feet.
-[all laugh]

51:10.442 --> 51:14.321
Betty always treats people with dignity

51:14.404 --> 51:16.990
and respect and charm.

51:17.365 --> 51:20.744
She has a far closer relationship
to animals than she does to people.

51:20.827 --> 51:22.412
[woman] You were telling me a story
a long time ago

51:22.496 --> 51:25.123
about how you used to go
backpacking with your family...

51:25.207 --> 51:26.583
-In the Sierras.
-...in the Sierras.

51:26.666 --> 51:28.043
Did you ever see bears there?

51:28.126 --> 51:30.045
'Cause there were probably
a bigger population.

51:30.128 --> 51:32.088
-Only black bears.
-Only black bears, yeah.

51:32.172 --> 51:33.882
But we'd go to Yellowstone,

51:33.965 --> 51:36.426
and that's where you see the old grizzly.

51:36.885 --> 51:39.095
And every summer,
they would go into the High Sierras

51:39.179 --> 51:41.556
and literally live on the land.

51:41.640 --> 51:45.143
We'd pack into the High Sierras,
just the three of us,

51:45.227 --> 51:47.312
<i>and be up there for three weeks,</i>
<i>all alone.</i>

51:47.395 --> 51:50.357
<i>We'd never see another human being.</i>

51:50.440 --> 51:52.359
<i>That's when you see wildlife.</i>

51:54.361 --> 51:55.779
That's when you see...

51:55.862 --> 51:58.406
You can't do this, though, unfortunately.

51:58.740 --> 51:59.908
[man] Well, you may only
get to do it once.

51:59.991 --> 52:01.576
-[woman] Yeah, you would do it one time.
-[all laugh]

52:01.660 --> 52:03.829
-Only once.
-Yeah.

52:03.912 --> 52:07.207
But moose, you see moose,
and that was exciting.

52:07.290 --> 52:09.459
I'd go back to school, and they'd say,

52:09.543 --> 52:10.877
"You were up there with your--

52:10.961 --> 52:14.047
What did you talk about? What did you do?"

52:14.130 --> 52:16.216
I said, "You just don't understand."

52:16.299 --> 52:18.885
We were animal nuts, all three of us.

52:18.969 --> 52:22.472
I think they were so disappointed
when I was a baby

52:22.556 --> 52:25.767
-that they had a baby.
-[all laugh]

52:25.851 --> 52:27.435
[woman] They were hoping

52:27.519 --> 52:29.104
-to have a litter.
-Why not a little animal?

52:29.187 --> 52:31.648
Betty hopefully is going to be remembered

52:31.731 --> 52:34.651
as a very kind person, a loving person,

52:34.734 --> 52:38.947
an extremely terrific actress, comedian,

52:39.865 --> 52:41.783
but I think she really
wants to be remembered

52:41.867 --> 52:45.078
<i>as one who gave most</i>
<i>of her life to animals.</i>

52:45.161 --> 52:47.455
-Oh, oh, I know.
-[woman] Oh, my goodness.

52:50.208 --> 52:52.460
[all laughing]

52:56.214 --> 52:58.049
You know, some songs
sort of make the rounds.

52:58.133 --> 52:59.926
They come around just every so often,

53:00.010 --> 53:02.512
and others just never really go away.

53:02.596 --> 53:04.723
I guess this one sort of falls
into the latter category

53:04.806 --> 53:07.058
'cause you hear it just every so often.

53:07.684 --> 53:10.478
[singing] <i>♪ Maybe I'm right ♪</i>

53:10.562 --> 53:13.064
<i>♪ Maybe I'm wrong ♪</i>

53:13.607 --> 53:15.525
<i>♪ Maybe I'm weak ♪</i>

53:15.609 --> 53:18.320
<i>♪ And maybe I'm strong ♪</i>

53:18.403 --> 53:19.946
<i>♪ But nevertheless ♪</i>

53:20.030 --> 53:23.909

53:23.992 --> 53:26.661
[Bertinelli] <i>She is every woman.</i>

53:26.745 --> 53:28.455
She doesn't offend.

53:28.538 --> 53:30.916
She's funny. She's quick.

53:31.124 --> 53:32.542
She's very smart.

53:32.751 --> 53:35.378
It's just the magic of Betty White.
Not everybody has that.

53:35.462 --> 53:37.422
I think people are attracted to that

53:37.505 --> 53:39.674
because we spend our whole lives
just trying to figure out,

53:39.758 --> 53:42.093
like, what we really want to do,

53:42.260 --> 53:44.679
and for Betty, it's entertaining people,

53:44.763 --> 53:47.974
and she just genuinely feels that way,
and it's infectious.

53:48.058 --> 53:53.021
Just courage and grace and love of life,

53:53.104 --> 53:56.232
I think that's the secret to longevity.

53:56.441 --> 54:01.696
If you pass 70, just look to Betty,
and that's the way to do it.

54:01.780 --> 54:03.949
She twinkles. She does twinkle.

54:04.824 --> 54:06.326
<i>Oh, she's one of a kind.</i>

54:06.910 --> 54:11.164
<i>♪ Maybe I'll live a life of regret ♪</i>

54:11.748 --> 54:13.416
<i>♪ Maybe I'll give ♪</i>

54:13.500 --> 54:16.211
<i>♪ Much more than I get ♪</i>

54:17.295 --> 54:23.677
<i>♪ Nevertheless</i>
<i>I'm in love with you ♪</i>

54:24.260 --> 54:28.431
<i>♪ Somehow I knew at a glance</i>
<i>the terrible chance... ♪</i>

54:28.515 --> 54:30.350
She's just genuine.

54:30.475 --> 54:32.352
Like, it isn't an act.

54:32.435 --> 54:34.270
I think her legacy is kindness,

54:34.354 --> 54:36.898
and just, you know,
there is always a silver lining,

54:36.982 --> 54:39.067
and she embodies that.

54:39.150 --> 54:42.195
One of the smartest, funniest, kindest,

54:42.278 --> 54:44.823
most generous women in a business

54:44.906 --> 54:49.619
that doesn't normally have
that kind of people in it,

54:49.703 --> 54:51.913
um, but that's how she'll be remembered.

54:52.080 --> 54:55.000
<i>♪ ...much more than I'll get ♪</i>

54:55.875 --> 54:57.961
<i>♪ Nevertheless ♪</i>

54:58.044 --> 55:05.010
<i>♪ I'm in love with you ♪</i>

55:10.765 --> 55:12.017
[audience applauding]

55:21.067 --> 55:24.821
People have been
stuck with me for so long,

55:24.904 --> 55:28.408
and bless their hearts,
been so supportive.

55:28.491 --> 55:33.580
But I am amazed
that I'm still on television.

55:33.663 --> 55:37.167
They still let me come back,
and I'm not saying that coyly.

55:37.250 --> 55:40.378
I mean it. It's such a privilege

55:40.462 --> 55:44.049
to still be able to work in this business.
