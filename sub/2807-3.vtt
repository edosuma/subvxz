WEBVTT

00:03.294 --> 00:07.089
- Are you excited about our honeymoon?
- Yeah, I am.

00:07.298 --> 00:10.384
Bermuda, Bahama
Come on, pretty mama

00:10.635 --> 00:14.138
Get it out of your system
while we're alone.

00:14.389 --> 00:18.267
- We came to say goodbye.
- Have a great honeymoon.

00:18.476 --> 00:20.269
- Thanks.
- I'll go pack.

00:20.478 --> 00:24.940
I already packed. The only thing
I couldn't find, though, was your Speedo.

00:27.235 --> 00:31.113
Speedo? Uh, I don't have a Speedo.

00:31.364 --> 00:35.826
I'm gonna go pack
my regular, long bathing suit.

00:37.495 --> 00:40.873
Good, you're still here. I wanted
to tell you to have a good honeymoon.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.958
Oh, thank you.

00:43.209 --> 00:47.463
And I wanted you guys to know
that I am telling the father today.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.385
What? What? What?

00:55.138 --> 00:58.432
- We know it's Ross.
- How? How do you know?

00:58.683 --> 01:01.643
It was his sweater. But, oh, my God!

01:02.687 --> 01:06.106
I so wanted Ross to know first.
But I'm so relieved that you guys know.

01:06.357 --> 01:10.152
- That's so great. I'll be your baby's aunt!
- I know.

01:10.361 --> 01:15.282
- Me too!
- I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here.

01:15.992 --> 01:20.120
- You'll all be aunts and uncles.
- But I'm the only one related by blood.

01:21.623 --> 01:27.127
Okay, great. Now that you all know,
you can give me advice on how to tell Ross.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.879
What were you gonna say?

01:29.089 --> 01:33.383
That I'm gonna have the baby,
and he can be as involved as he wants.

01:33.593 --> 01:35.260
Well, that sounds good.

01:35.470 --> 01:39.139
Yeah, but how do I start?
What's the first thing that I say?

01:43.561 --> 01:46.939
- Okay, great. Thanks.
- Hey, good luck.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.483
Yeah, bye.

01:49.692 --> 01:51.193
What was that all about?

01:51.444 --> 01:56.156
Well, I guess no harm in telling you now.
Rachel and Ross are having a baby.

01:56.366 --> 02:02.412
What? I didn't
even know! Why didn't you tell me?

02:02.664 --> 02:05.666
Why am I talking like this?

02:06.459 --> 02:08.252
I didn't think
you could keep it a secret.

02:08.461 --> 02:13.715
What? I'm an excellent
secret-keeper. I've kept all our secrets.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.677
- What secrets?
- No, no, Joey.

02:16.886 --> 02:21.723
I'm not gonna tell you because
I am an excellent secret-keeper.

02:24.102 --> 02:27.354
- Psst. You'll tell me later?
- You already know.

03:10.273 --> 03:14.610
It's so romantic to send people off
on their honeymoon.

03:14.861 --> 03:18.780
You know, Monica and Chandler are married.
Ross and Rachel are having a baby.

03:19.032 --> 03:25.120
- Maybe you and I should do something.
- All in good time, my love. All in good time.

03:26.247 --> 03:31.001
Oh, shoot. I left my guitar in their apartment.
You can let me in later, right?

03:31.211 --> 03:33.670
No, I don't have a key.
They took mine to give to you.

03:33.880 --> 03:38.884
- What? They took mine to give to you.
- Why would they take away our keys?

03:39.135 --> 03:40.594
Maybe they don't trust us.

03:40.803 --> 03:43.680
They let me keep my key
the last time they were out of town.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.183
You mean the time
you broke the ketchup bottle...

03:46.392 --> 03:49.102
...and cleaned it up
with Monica's guest towels?

03:49.312 --> 03:51.855
- I washed those.
- No, you didn't.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.566
Yeah, that didn't sound like me.

03:55.235 --> 03:59.488
- What am I gonna do? I really need my guitar.
- I have stuff in there too.

03:59.697 --> 04:04.201
- What stuff?
- Monica's chicken parm. I'll take care of this.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.121
Mr. Treeger? It's Joey Tribbiani.

04:08.331 --> 04:12.459
I need to get into Monica
and Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency.

04:12.669 --> 04:17.464
Uh... Uh... Gas leak.
Oh, and bring garlic bread.

04:19.676 --> 04:20.716
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:21.010 --> 04:23.595
- Did Rachel find you?
- No, why?

04:23.846 --> 04:28.934
- She was looking for you.
- Well, I guess I'll catch up with her later.

04:29.769 --> 04:34.523
- She really wanted to talk to you now.
- Yeah, it seemed pretty important.

04:36.859 --> 04:40.195
- Oh, no.
- What?

04:40.822 --> 04:42.864
I think I might know
what this is about.

04:45.785 --> 04:47.077
Really?

04:47.287 --> 04:52.666
Yeah. We promised we weren't
gonna tell anybody this...

04:54.002 --> 04:57.713
...but a month ago,
Rachel and I slept together.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.340
And?

05:03.553 --> 05:09.808
- Wow, I thought you'd be more shocked.
- Oh, sorry. And?

05:13.646 --> 05:18.150
Well, we said we'd just
do it that one time...

05:18.401 --> 05:22.112
...but now I think she may
wanna start things up again.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.032
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.

05:26.034 --> 05:31.288
- Why? What else could it be?
- Oh, wow, I don't feel well.

05:32.832 --> 05:36.668
I'm telling you, I'm telling you,
that's what it is.

05:36.878 --> 05:40.672
No wonder she was looking
at me all funny during the wedding.

05:40.965 --> 05:43.425
She didn't say anything to you?

05:43.634 --> 05:46.678
- Maybe it's something you ate.
- It could've been...

05:46.888 --> 05:51.516
- Please, just go and talk to Rachel.
- Yeah, I guess I should.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.854
Man, you know what I have to realize?

05:56.064 --> 06:00.067
Maybe I'm not the type of guy
women can have just one night with.

06:02.362 --> 06:07.157
They always seem to want
a little bit more.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.702
I should remember that.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.963
Next.

06:22.423 --> 06:26.051
- They're kissing. Let's go around them.
- Leave them alone. They're in love.

06:26.302 --> 06:29.638
I'm in love too.
But in an orderly fashion.

06:29.847 --> 06:32.933
- Next.
- Hi. Can you do that and walk?

06:33.142 --> 06:35.143
Because she said, "Next."

06:35.812 --> 06:40.232
Sorry, we didn't hear you.
We're on our honeymoon.

06:40.441 --> 06:46.488
Aw. Let me see what I can do.
There are some first-class seats available.

06:46.697 --> 06:50.283
They bumped them up to first class
because they're on their honeymoon.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.452
Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.

06:52.662 --> 06:55.122
We are on our honeymoon.

06:55.373 --> 06:59.167
- Grab my ass.
- Next.

06:59.377 --> 07:04.756
Sorry, I almost didn't hear you because
I'm so in love with my new husband.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.926
- We're on our honeymoon.
- Congratulations.

07:08.177 --> 07:13.265
Mr. Bing, you'll be in 25J,
and Mrs. Bing, you're in 25K.

07:13.474 --> 07:18.103
We're on our honeymoon, so can you do
your little thing, bump us up to first class?

07:18.354 --> 07:21.982
I'm sorry, all the first-class seats are taken.
That couple got the last two.

07:22.191 --> 07:27.946
If we'd gone around them like I said,
she'd have given us those tickets. Damn it.

07:28.197 --> 07:32.451
25J and K, any chance
those aren't together?

07:33.494 --> 07:36.955
I still can't believe they took away my key.
You trust me with yours.

07:37.165 --> 07:40.125
Of course I do.
And I'll give it back to you...

07:40.376 --> 07:43.628
...as soon as they're done with it
at the key-shining place.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.676
What the hell is that?

07:50.553 --> 07:54.389
- Whoa, whoa. Treeger, what are you doing?
- You said there was a gas leak in here.

07:54.599 --> 07:59.478
- Why don't you use your key?
- I won't find it before the place explodes.

07:59.729 --> 08:03.523
If that happens at another building
I manage, people will start asking questions.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.317
Come on, hurry up.

08:05.776 --> 08:06.985
Oh!

08:08.196 --> 08:11.031
We could have done that.

08:13.409 --> 08:16.536
Look at that. They're going into
the first-class lounge.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.955
- Do you know what they have in there?
- No.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.750
Me neither. We have to get in!

08:23.419 --> 08:26.254
- Just act like you belong.
- Oh, my God! Oranges!

08:26.464 --> 08:27.923
Shh!

08:29.091 --> 08:34.179
- Nice to see you again.
- Sir, may I see your tickets, please?

08:34.429 --> 08:36.056
Yes, of course.

08:37.265 --> 08:39.768
Would you move your thumb.
I can't see the seat number.

08:39.977 --> 08:43.813
That's all right.
I have it memorized. It's 1A.

08:45.733 --> 08:49.653
- Sir, this isn't a first-class ticket. I'm sorry.
- Apology accepted. Excuse us.

08:49.862 --> 08:54.616
Sir, I'm afraid I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.826
Fine.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.996
Go, go, go!

09:12.969 --> 09:14.386
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:14.679 --> 09:15.762
Hi.

09:15.972 --> 09:20.141
I think there's something that
we really need to talk about.

09:20.768 --> 09:24.980
I think we do.
Why don't we go inside.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.485
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:30.695 --> 09:35.323
- Look, I know why you're here.
- You do?

09:35.575 --> 09:41.621
Yeah, and to save you from any
embarrassment, I think I should talk first.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.707
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.292
Here.

09:53.092 --> 09:58.847
Ross and Rachel.
Rachel and Ross. Heh.

10:00.016 --> 10:03.852
It's been one heck of a seesaw,
hasn't it?

10:04.645 --> 10:05.895
What?

10:06.606 --> 10:12.819
I mean, look, that one night we had
was fun and certainly passionate.

10:13.029 --> 10:16.781
But don't you think it's better
if we just stay friends?

10:18.909 --> 10:20.827
Seriously, what?

10:22.204 --> 10:25.582
Okay, okay. You know what?

10:25.791 --> 10:29.711
If you want to,
we can do it one more time.

10:32.465 --> 10:38.094
I'd be okay with that.
In fact, I have some time right now.

10:38.304 --> 10:42.641
- You know what? Ahem. Can I talk now?
- Oh, sure.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.982
I'm pregnant.

10:55.071 --> 11:03.078
Ross?

11:03.704 --> 11:06.665
Okay, whenever you're ready.

11:13.589 --> 11:17.258
And you're the father, by the way.
But you're good.

11:29.105 --> 11:33.483
- Can I get you some water?
- I'm good, I'm good.

11:33.734 --> 11:40.115
Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay?
You can be as involved as you want.

11:43.494 --> 11:49.916
Yeah, I, uh... I'm just, I don't know.
I don't understand...

11:51.377 --> 11:53.878
...how this happened.

11:56.132 --> 11:59.300
- We used a condom.
- I know.

11:59.510 --> 12:04.556
But you know, condoms only work,
like, 97 percent of the time.

12:05.015 --> 12:07.016
What? What?

12:08.853 --> 12:10.979
What?

12:11.689 --> 12:15.650
Well, they should put that on the box!

12:17.695 --> 12:20.572
- They do.
- No, they don't!

12:26.579 --> 12:30.749
Well, they should put it
in huge block letters!

12:30.958 --> 12:36.588
- Let's just forget about the condoms.
- Well, I may as well have!

12:38.174 --> 12:44.804
- Listen, I was really freaked out too when...
- Freaked out? No, I'm not freaked out.

12:45.055 --> 12:48.475
I'm indignant as a consumer!

12:49.810 --> 12:53.688
- You know what? Let's talk later.
- No. No, I wanna talk now.

12:53.898 --> 13:00.737
In fact, I wanna talk to
the president of the condom company.

13:00.946 --> 13:04.157
- Okay, maybe I should come back...
- Shh!

13:04.658 --> 13:07.494
Yeah, I'll press one!

13:10.956 --> 13:16.669
- I looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.
- So now I can heat this up?

13:17.213 --> 13:19.464
Anyway, I'll get moving on that new door.

13:19.673 --> 13:24.636
Great. And could you do us a favor and
not tell Chandler and Monica about this?

13:24.887 --> 13:28.306
Because, you know,
they don't have any kids of their own...

13:28.557 --> 13:31.935
...and this door was
like a child to them.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.355
I have to put on a new lock.
They'll find out anyway.

13:35.564 --> 13:37.065
Oh, no.

13:37.900 --> 13:43.029
This looks like an all-day job.
I'll have to cancel my yoga class.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.531
- Hey, Ross.
- Hey.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.699
Could you tell Jasmine
I can't make it to yoga?

13:46.909 --> 13:47.992
Sure.

13:53.415 --> 13:57.752
- My God. What happened to the door?
- So it's noticeable, huh?

13:58.045 --> 14:01.548
- Is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
- Didn't you two already talk?

14:01.757 --> 14:04.008
Yeah, but...

14:04.301 --> 14:09.180
Okay, look. You guys know Rachel and I slept
together, but there's something else.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.351
Rachel's pregnant.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.980
- Holy mother of God!
- Oh, my God! I can't believe it!

14:19.525 --> 14:24.279
- With my child.
- That is brand-new information!

14:28.492 --> 14:32.203
- You already know, don't you?
- A little bit.

14:32.454 --> 14:36.165
- How you doing?
- Okay. Okay. I mean, I'll be okay.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.835
It's just I don't think
I handled it very well.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.170
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.

14:41.422 --> 14:46.134
But the complaint department
at the condom company got an earful.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.136
Then when I turned around,
she was gone.

14:48.345 --> 14:49.762
Oh, Ross.

14:49.972 --> 14:55.184
But in my defense, I found out
that condoms are only 97 percent effective.

14:55.436 --> 14:58.062
- What?
- I gotta go find her.

14:58.272 --> 15:04.944
Hold on! Are you serious? So, like,
3 percent of the time they don't even work?

15:05.529 --> 15:08.781
Huh? They should put that on the box!

15:09.867 --> 15:12.577
- Evidently, they do.
- What?

15:21.629 --> 15:25.381
- I can't believe we're here.
- You've gotta be kidding.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.091
What?

15:28.677 --> 15:32.722
As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would
like to give you the Honeymoon Suite.

15:32.973 --> 15:36.392
No! You have been screwing us all day!

15:36.685 --> 15:40.688
- Who are you?
- We're you. Just 10 seconds later!

15:42.316 --> 15:46.235
You already got the first-class tickets,
the lounge. We should get free stuff too!

15:46.487 --> 15:49.530
You're not the only ones
on your honeymoon!

15:50.658 --> 15:54.994
You can have the suite, if you want.
We don't care about where we stay.

15:55.245 --> 15:59.582
We're here to celebrate our love for
each other. We don't have to get free stuff.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.043
We just want to be together.

16:04.713 --> 16:06.673
We need the stuff.

16:09.551 --> 16:13.471
Hey, Monica, it's Joey. Phoebe and I
smell gas coming from your apartment.

16:13.681 --> 16:18.768
- Are you serious? Joey smells gas.
- What else is new?

16:19.019 --> 16:23.773
- We'd check it out, but you took our keys.
- Do something. Get in there!

16:24.024 --> 16:28.361
- How? I guess I could break down your door.
- Yeah, do that.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.823
- You won't blame us for any damage?
- No.

16:33.784 --> 16:38.538
- Are you doing it? I can't hear anything.
- Okay, I'll break it down.

16:42.376 --> 16:46.421
He's doing it,
he's breaking down the door.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.551
Okay, we're in.

16:55.597 --> 17:00.560
- Rachel, are you comfortable?
- If I said I was, would you judge me?

17:00.936 --> 17:03.146
The doctor will be here soon
to do your sonogram.

17:03.355 --> 17:04.564
Okay.

17:08.234 --> 17:13.156
Oh, man, I swear, if they sold
these at Pottery Barn...

17:15.075 --> 17:16.409
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.327
We need to talk.

17:18.579 --> 17:22.582
Right now? I kind of got an alfresco
situation going on over here.

17:24.001 --> 17:27.962
Please. Please, I want to apologize
for the way I acted earlier today.

17:28.172 --> 17:31.924
- That's fine. Can you stay up near my head?
- Yeah, sorry.

17:32.134 --> 17:37.847
I went crazy. I was thinking about myself
when I should've been thinking about you.

17:38.098 --> 17:40.308
- Head, Ross. Head, Ross. Head, Ross.
- Right.

17:40.517 --> 17:45.021
I want you to know that I'll be
there through this whole thing. Okay?

17:45.230 --> 17:50.318
The doctor's appointments, Lamaze classes,
baby-proofing the apartment.

17:50.527 --> 17:54.072
- We can do that after we get married.
- Married?

17:54.281 --> 17:55.948
Yeah, we should get married.

17:56.158 --> 17:59.118
Because that's your answer
to everything?

18:01.246 --> 18:04.082
No, because that's the right thing to do.

18:04.291 --> 18:09.879
Yeah, maybe, if you're in love.
But, Ross, we are not in love, are we?

18:10.130 --> 18:15.676
No, but still, I mean,
you can't possibly do this alone.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.386
Excuse me?

18:17.638 --> 18:22.350
Come on, you can't even eat alone
in a restaurant.

18:22.559 --> 18:25.061
- What?
- I'm saying if you can't eat by yourself...

18:25.270 --> 18:27.188
...how can you have a baby by yourself?

18:27.397 --> 18:30.942
- I can too eat by myself.
- When have you ever?

18:31.193 --> 18:35.822
When certain people leave the table
and I am not finished!

18:36.031 --> 18:39.492
Well, certain other people take two hours
to eat a bowl of soup.

18:39.701 --> 18:41.953
Please, you inhale your food.

18:42.204 --> 18:45.456
I grew up with Monica. If you
didn't eat fast, you didn't eat!

18:49.378 --> 18:50.878
Am I interrupting?

18:51.130 --> 18:54.674
No, Dr. Long, please come in.
This is Ross, he's the father.

18:54.883 --> 18:58.928
But not the husband,
because she can do this alone.

18:59.221 --> 19:03.307
Nice to meet you.
I'll get started on this.

19:05.018 --> 19:10.398
- Why can't you admit you need me?
- I need you. I need you to stay near my head!

19:11.525 --> 19:16.904
Okay. Everything looks good.
Here it is on the screen.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.949
There's your uterus...

19:20.159 --> 19:24.245
...and right here is your baby.

19:25.789 --> 19:28.332
Oh, my God.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.418
Wow.

19:31.753 --> 19:34.213
There it is, I see it.

19:34.423 --> 19:38.384
Congratulations.
I'll give you two a minute.

19:38.635 --> 19:40.761
Thank you.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.062
Pretty amazing, huh?

19:50.314 --> 19:52.899
I don't see it!

20:00.782 --> 20:05.077
- What? What?
- I can't see it.

20:05.329 --> 20:08.623
- You just said that you did.
- I know, I lied.

20:08.874 --> 20:12.877
I didn't want her to think I was a terrible
mother. I can't even see my own baby.

20:13.086 --> 20:19.050
Come here. Sure you can.
Come here. Look, it's right there.

20:21.803 --> 20:23.054
Oh.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.016
Oh, it's beautiful.

20:27.809 --> 20:30.144
I see it now.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.732
- Do you really?
- No, I don't see it!

20:34.983 --> 20:37.610
Okay, come on. Come on.
All right. Okay. Okay.

20:37.861 --> 20:43.199
You see this tiny thing
that looks like a peanut?

20:44.034 --> 20:45.076
Yeah.

20:45.994 --> 20:47.787
Sweetie, that's it.

20:48.372 --> 20:52.541
That's it? Well, I saw that.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.712
Oh.

20:57.881 --> 21:01.175
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:04.554 --> 21:08.849
Wow, I can't believe that's our baby.

21:11.645 --> 21:14.730
Yeah, that's our baby.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.491
- Hi.
- Hey.

21:26.118 --> 21:29.245
- So how was the doctor?
- Everything went great.

21:29.496 --> 21:32.873
- Good.
- Hey, show them the picture of your uterus.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.211
Aw.

21:39.047 --> 21:40.673
I don't see the baby. Where is it?

21:40.882 --> 21:45.511
I know, I couldn't see it either
at first. But it's right, um...

21:46.221 --> 21:48.347
Ross, I lost it again.
