<i>Dmitry is back.</i>

00:02.617 --> 00:03.866
Do you really think
he had something to do

00:03.868 --> 00:05.318
- with Boris's death?
- I don't know.

00:05.320 --> 00:06.653
But I'm gonna find out.

00:06.655 --> 00:08.270
I think I figured out Dmitry's motive.

00:08.272 --> 00:10.540
Boris and Dmitry were brothers.

00:10.542 --> 00:12.659
His name is Milos. He's Boris's cousin.

00:12.661 --> 00:14.460
He seems really upset
about Boris's death.

00:14.462 --> 00:15.778
So when are you meeting up with him?

00:15.780 --> 00:16.996
He lives in Budapest.

00:16.998 --> 00:20.299
Your HCG levels have plateaued.

00:20.301 --> 00:22.284
This pregnancy may not be viable.

00:22.286 --> 00:23.920
So we met with Shelby.
She offered to have us

00:23.922 --> 00:25.838
take a look at their hospital
in Savannah.

00:25.840 --> 00:27.256
I'll go.

00:27.258 --> 00:28.307
Would you want to go along?

00:28.309 --> 00:30.643
Georgia. I'm willing to travel.

00:30.645 --> 00:32.061
Great, it's this weekend.

00:32.063 --> 00:33.295

Oh, I'm not going. Just Divya.

I've never been to City Hall.

00:57.589 --> 00:58.921
It's called Village Hall.

- Evan, relax.

- Hi.

What brings the two of you
here to Village Hall?

have agreed to allow Hankmed

01:10.435 --> 01:11.684

01:11.686 --> 01:13.502
- out of Shadow Pond.
- Right.

01:13.504 --> 01:14.637
So I'm submitting a signed petition

01:14.639 --> 01:16.806
to ask for a zoning waiver.

I hope you won't take this
too personally or anything.

Of course not.

01:20.979 --> 01:22.678
In fact, after your lovely party

01:22.680 --> 01:25.181
I started thinking maybe
I should support Hankmed.

01:25.183 --> 01:28.284
Oh! Well... I...

01:28.286 --> 01:29.685
I don't know what to say.

01:29.687 --> 01:32.405
But I also thought that before
I signed anything,

01:32.407 --> 01:34.207
I should do my due diligence.

01:34.209 --> 01:35.958
And that's when I discovered

01:35.960 --> 01:38.578
that Hankmed doesn't have
a valid business license.

01:38.580 --> 01:40.213

01:40.215 --> 01:41.664

01:41.666 --> 01:43.666

01:49.890 --> 01:51.974
What do you mean
we're not a valid business?

01:51.976 --> 01:53.643
I know. It's crazy.

01:53.645 --> 01:55.211
I forgot to check one little box

01:55.213 --> 01:56.345
when I applied for our original license.

01:56.347 --> 01:58.881
Like, one box, Henry! A little one.

Okay, I'm... I'm sorry.

02:02.604 --> 02:03.903
So, we've never been licensed?

02:03.905 --> 02:05.071
I've already fixed it.

02:05.073 --> 02:08.024
We just have to shut down for,
like, 72 hours.

02:08.026 --> 02:09.390
- Why?
- That's how long

02:09.393 --> 02:11.527

to get processed.

is still out of town.

You could go to Miami,

- Budapest.

for an early death.

10:35.396 --> 10:37.113
But it's true, we never expected to lose

10:37.115 --> 10:38.731
my cousin in an explosion.

10:38.733 --> 10:40.933
I understand your grief.

10:40.935 --> 10:45.538
Boris wasn't just a patient,
he was... he was my friend.

10:45.540 --> 10:46.872
You are very humble.

10:46.874 --> 10:51.443
Especially since Boris
was so healthy, thanks to you.

10:51.445 --> 10:55.447
Another reason, I must confess,
I am glad we finally meet.

10:59.803 --> 11:02.121
I share more than a surname with Boris.

11:02.123 --> 11:04.390
You have the same genetic disease

11:06.093 --> 11:07.560
my most recent bone scans.

11:07.562 --> 11:08.811
Would you mind taking a look?

11:08.813 --> 11:10.796
- Of course.
- Thank you.

11:14.935 --> 11:17.987
Yep. Low bone density.

11:17.989 --> 11:20.139
What does your doctor say
about myopathy?

11:20.141 --> 11:22.141
No, hmm... how you say...

11:22.143 --> 11:24.476
degeneration? No trouble breathing.

11:24.478 --> 11:26.946
Well, those are good signs.

11:26.948 --> 11:30.282
Milos, I'm not a specialist
in your family disease,

11:30.284 --> 11:33.753
but you might consider flexible
intramedullary fixation devices,

11:33.755 --> 11:35.871
which protect weak bones.

11:35.873 --> 11:38.040
I'd be happy to research these if you...

11:38.042 --> 11:41.010
I would like. Thank you.

11:41.012 --> 11:43.162
Thank you.
[Chuckles]

11:46.633 --> 11:48.184
Welcome to Savannah General.

11:48.186 --> 11:50.353
I'm Britney, your admissions liaison.

11:50.355 --> 11:52.188
- Oh, where's the waiting room?
- We don't have one.

11:52.190 --> 11:54.640
No one waits here.

11:54.642 --> 11:56.508
In addition to our hospital's

11:56.510 --> 11:58.561
state-of-the-art medical facilities,

11:58.563 --> 12:00.846
we also have a full service salon

12:00.848 --> 12:03.032
for our staff, patients,
and their guests.

12:03.034 --> 12:04.567
Uh-huh. I just need a bathroom.

12:04.569 --> 12:05.701
Oh.

12:07.704 --> 12:09.855
A little further.
Over here, to the left.

12:09.857 --> 12:11.190
Where?
[Laughs]

12:11.192 --> 12:12.324
Okay, though I trust you completely,

12:12.326 --> 12:13.409
- this is still...
- Stop.

12:13.411 --> 12:16.996
Somewhat scary. What?

12:16.998 --> 12:19.749
- Surprise!
- Oh, wow!

12:19.751 --> 12:22.718
- [Laughs] Sit.
- What is this?

12:22.720 --> 12:26.555
I got all of your favorites.

12:26.557 --> 12:28.007
- Caviar.
- Ooh!

12:28.009 --> 12:30.393
- Smelly cheeses.
- Nice.

12:30.395 --> 12:33.729
- Fancy crackers.
- What's the occasion?

12:33.731 --> 12:36.482
You.

12:36.484 --> 12:38.601
Me.

12:38.603 --> 12:41.987
Alone for three days.

12:41.989 --> 12:45.024
Let's make the most of them.

12:45.026 --> 12:47.026
I'm actually okay with
what happened this morning.

12:47.028 --> 12:48.393
Yeah?

12:48.395 --> 12:50.562
It gave me some time to do
a little research.

12:50.564 --> 12:53.082
It turns out, a private citizen

12:53.084 --> 12:55.785
can make public comments at the
conclusion of council business,

12:55.787 --> 12:57.286
- like at the end of the meeting.
- Uh-huh.

12:57.288 --> 12:59.705
So, private citizen "me"
can submit a petition

12:59.707 --> 13:01.123
to get a zoning waiver approved.

13:01.125 --> 13:03.793
That way, once our business
license is processed,

13:03.795 --> 13:05.094
all our problems are gone for good.

13:05.096 --> 13:06.962
- Evan, that's great.
- I know.

13:06.964 --> 13:10.082
Now all I've gotta do
is cut my presentation down

13:10.084 --> 13:12.084
from ten minutes to five minutes.

13:13.553 --> 13:17.189
Um, maybe three minutes, too.

13:17.191 --> 13:19.358
You want to rehearse, don't you?

13:19.360 --> 13:21.927
No.

13:21.929 --> 13:24.730
I think I remember how to do this.

13:26.566 --> 13:28.567
[Laughs]

13:32.989 --> 13:35.440
Hey, doc.

13:35.442 --> 13:37.293
Um, good news.

13:37.295 --> 13:40.079
As the doctor explained,
your M.R.I. is clear,

13:40.081 --> 13:42.465
so there's no mass,
and there's no spinal fracture.

13:42.467 --> 13:44.717
- Oh, so I'm okay?
- It's true.

13:44.719 --> 13:45.835
What happened today might

13:45.837 --> 13:47.803
- be an isolated incident.
- Good.

13:47.805 --> 13:50.756
We've got our second game
against the Jackets tomorrow.

13:50.758 --> 13:53.726
I understand how much
baseball means to you.

13:53.728 --> 13:55.561
Oh, come on, you too.

13:55.563 --> 13:57.813
I saw the old-school scorecard
in your pocket.

13:57.815 --> 13:59.265
You're a real fan, aren't you?

13:59.267 --> 14:01.767
Um, my dad taught me.

14:01.769 --> 14:05.020
We were... ahem.

14:05.022 --> 14:07.907
He loved sports.

14:07.909 --> 14:09.775
And I love statistics.

14:09.777 --> 14:12.027
Baseball was something we could share.

14:12.029 --> 14:13.979
Yeah, did you promise your dad

14:13.981 --> 14:15.748
you'd make it to the big leagues, too?

14:15.750 --> 14:20.286
Oh, I was never a player,
just an admirer.

14:20.288 --> 14:21.954
Every game, a player
steps up to the plate

14:21.956 --> 14:24.006
and tries to hit a 95-mile-an-hour ball

14:24.008 --> 14:26.158
in 1/10th of a second,

14:26.160 --> 14:28.377
and every game, it happens.

14:28.379 --> 14:31.297
Watching baseball is seeing
the impossible become possible.

14:31.299 --> 14:33.132
Yeah, I just like the sound
the bat makes

14:33.134 --> 14:34.350
when I hit one on the screws.

14:34.352 --> 14:35.885
I like that, too.

14:35.887 --> 14:38.687
When will we get the first results?

14:38.689 --> 14:40.222
Right away.

14:40.224 --> 14:42.841
Really can't take
your eyes off her, can you?

14:42.843 --> 14:44.610
Who?
[Laughs]

14:44.612 --> 14:46.028
All right, man, it wasn't a criticism,

14:46.030 --> 14:49.014
just an observation.

14:49.016 --> 14:51.033
Divya is my colleague, nothing more.

14:52.068 --> 14:53.652
Sorry to interrupt.

14:53.654 --> 14:57.573
Tripp's blood and E.M.G. results
will be ready tomorrow.

14:57.575 --> 14:58.857
Where will you be?

14:58.859 --> 15:00.960
At the stadium.

15:00.962 --> 15:02.294
Two tickets?

15:02.296 --> 15:04.029
Uh, one will do. She's not a fan.

15:07.217 --> 15:09.385
Hey, Ev, it's me.

15:09.387 --> 15:11.887
I just wanted to let you know
that everything's fine.

15:11.889 --> 15:15.474
I had a long talk with Milos.
Turns out he actually spent

15:15.476 --> 15:17.593
a lot of time with Boris
when they were growing up.

15:17.595 --> 15:22.815
Anyway, Milos seems cool,
and this city is amazing.

15:22.817 --> 15:25.050
I mean, it's just so...

15:27.854 --> 15:29.989
beautiful.

15:29.991 --> 15:31.357
Tell you everything when I get home,

15:31.359 --> 15:33.225
but I'm really glad I made the trip.

15:33.227 --> 15:35.227
All right, bye.

15:38.665 --> 15:39.999
[Thud]
Ooh.

15:40.001 --> 15:42.501
[Speaking hungarian]
It's okay, it's okay.

15:46.289 --> 15:48.040
[Moans]

15:48.042 --> 15:51.460
Oh.
[Moans]

15:51.462 --> 15:53.212
Oh.
[Tires screeching]

15:53.214 --> 15:55.431
[Grunts]
What?

15:55.433 --> 15:56.966
What's going on... whoa!

15:56.968 --> 15:59.101
[Speaking Russian]

15:59.103 --> 16:01.753
[Grunting]

16:06.993 --> 16:10.362
[Men speaking Russian]

16:10.364 --> 16:11.897
Uhh.

16:17.203 --> 16:19.204
[Grunts]

16:23.493 --> 16:27.329
[Grunting]

16:53.156 --> 16:57.443
[Men speaking Russian]

16:59.613 --> 17:01.080
He is awake.

17:09.089 --> 17:10.422
Boris?

17:10.424 --> 17:13.291
Hello, Hank.

17:13.294 --> 17:15.877
Don't worry, you're safe...

17:15.880 --> 17:17.512
You're in Budapest
and in a secure location.

17:17.515 --> 17:18.931
[Grunts]

17:18.933 --> 17:23.352
It's okay, it's just
a fast-acting sedative.

17:23.354 --> 17:26.221
You will be fine.

17:26.223 --> 17:27.772
Took the liberty to get your bags

17:27.775 --> 17:30.192
from the hotel, if it's okay.

17:30.194 --> 17:32.695
But obviously,
explanations are in order.

17:32.697 --> 17:35.314
Hell, yes, they're in order.

17:36.700 --> 17:37.849
Let's get you some coffee,

17:37.851 --> 17:40.018
and I'll start from the beginning.

17:50.997 --> 17:53.082
Welcome to our health and wellness fair.

17:53.084 --> 17:54.833
I do hope y'all enjoy it.

17:54.835 --> 17:57.169
Honestly, our unplanned trip
to your E.R.

17:57.171 --> 17:59.171
is going to be hard to top.

17:59.173 --> 18:01.707
Well, take a look around
as long as you like,

18:01.709 --> 18:03.709
and give a holler when you're
ready to go to your hotel.

18:03.711 --> 18:05.210
Thank you.

18:05.212 --> 18:08.213
They certainly are nice
around here... Jeremiah?

18:16.222 --> 18:18.557
Excuse me.
Can you answer a question about

18:18.559 --> 18:19.908
high-risk obstetrics?

18:19.910 --> 18:21.744
Yes, I run the perinatal center.

18:21.746 --> 18:26.231
If I may, I'm a P.A.
for a primary care physician.

18:26.233 --> 18:30.085
We have a patient.
She's about six weeks pregnant,

18:30.087 --> 18:35.090
and her HCG levels are low
and seem to have plateaued.

18:35.092 --> 18:37.843
Oh, that can be rough.

18:37.845 --> 18:42.881
But recently she's been experiencing...

18:42.883 --> 18:44.883
Uh, morning sickness.
[Laughs nervously]

18:44.885 --> 18:46.935
Uh, well, really,
middle of the day nausea.

18:46.937 --> 18:49.271
Is that a sign that her hormones
could be rising?

18:49.273 --> 18:51.940
No, there's been no correlation shown

18:51.942 --> 18:55.277
between nausea and rising HCG levels.

18:55.279 --> 18:57.613
When was the last time
your patient was tested?

18:59.699 --> 19:01.033
Uh, two days ago.

19:01.035 --> 19:03.452
But she has another appointment
scheduled on Monday.

19:03.454 --> 19:05.604
She can be checked sooner than that.

19:05.606 --> 19:08.774
Have her call me.

19:08.776 --> 19:12.795
Uh, she's leaving town
tomorrow, but, uh, thank you.

19:18.418 --> 19:21.787
d When did you give up?

19:21.789 --> 19:27.342
d When did you decide there's
no hope in this place? d

19:27.344 --> 19:31.146
d You should always look skyward d

19:31.148 --> 19:33.515
d Yeah

19:33.517 --> 19:36.769
d you're gonna find out

19:36.771 --> 19:40.823
d it's time for you to strike out d

19:40.825 --> 19:45.143
d There's no obstacles here

19:48.414 --> 19:50.949
So...

19:50.951 --> 19:55.654
After the car crash
following Carlos's birth,

19:55.656 --> 20:00.008
and then the poison that
was found in your pool...

20:00.010 --> 20:02.628
And then the HVAC infiltrator,

20:02.630 --> 20:06.498
you and Dmitry allied yourselves?

20:06.500 --> 20:09.218
I wanted to know
who was trying to kill me.

20:09.220 --> 20:12.104
I presented the possibility
of betraying Boris

20:12.106 --> 20:14.506
to a few of his family members.
The last person I expected

20:14.508 --> 20:16.191
to be interested was Milos.

20:16.193 --> 20:19.895
My cousin and I were quite close
at one time.

20:19.897 --> 20:24.015
I was a... [Chuckles]
mentor of his.

20:24.017 --> 20:27.286
But, he jumped at the chance
to hire Dima.

20:27.288 --> 20:30.155
We weighed his offer and decided
the only way to stop

20:30.157 --> 20:32.908
these attacks and discover why Milos

20:32.910 --> 20:35.828
was so eager for my demise

20:35.830 --> 20:37.362
was to let him actually think

20:37.364 --> 20:39.498
Dima had succeeded in killing me.

20:42.635 --> 20:44.803
And let all your friends think the same.

20:44.805 --> 20:48.257
No, actually, I thought we
should bring you into our trust.

20:48.259 --> 20:53.395
I was the one who insisted
on you not being drawn in, Hank.

20:53.397 --> 20:56.348
The dangers of which were made
all too real

20:56.350 --> 20:58.183
by your injury at Shadow Pond.

20:58.185 --> 21:02.771
An unintended consequence that,
believe me, I deeply regret.

21:02.773 --> 21:05.073
Not to mention the brain surgery,

21:05.075 --> 21:07.893
the six months of painful recovery.

21:10.196 --> 21:13.198
What about Marisa? Does she know?

21:13.200 --> 21:15.901
Of course. She and Carlos are staying...

21:18.454 --> 21:20.756
- In a secure location.
- Yes.

21:23.710 --> 21:25.294
I hope you understand, Hank,

21:25.296 --> 21:27.462
that this decision
was not taken lightly,

21:27.464 --> 21:29.548
and that as my friend,

21:29.550 --> 21:31.934
you will forgive the deception.

21:36.255 --> 21:39.090
Has your... plan

21:39.092 --> 21:41.443
shed any light on what Milos is after?

21:41.445 --> 21:42.611
Some.

21:42.613 --> 21:44.363
He refuses to go to the U.S.,

21:44.365 --> 21:48.116
but continues to push for access
to Shadow Pond.

21:48.118 --> 21:49.985
Whatever he wants seems to be there,

21:49.987 --> 21:52.154
which is why Dmitry has been
working in my home,

21:52.156 --> 21:54.272
- and for so long.
- But much to Milos's

21:54.274 --> 21:57.326
frustration, I've been releasing
the details of the inventory

21:57.328 --> 22:01.780
just one item at a time,
till we find out what he wants.

22:01.782 --> 22:03.615
Hmm.

22:03.617 --> 22:07.252
Well, why not just have him
arrested for attempted murder?

22:07.254 --> 22:11.256
Yeah. Extradition
is a complicated process,

22:11.258 --> 22:13.308
but that is our ultimate goal.

22:16.145 --> 22:18.797
[Exhales]

22:20.633 --> 22:22.300
Will we approve speed bumps

22:22.302 --> 22:24.653
or speed humps
in our public parking lots?

22:24.655 --> 22:26.972
- I vote bumps.
- I vote humps.

22:26.974 --> 22:30.025
Let us table this discussion
until our next session.

22:31.694 --> 22:34.279
The floor is now open
for public comment.

22:37.316 --> 22:40.168
Before I start, I'd just like to thank

22:40.170 --> 22:43.655
my old friend, Warren, for his
many years of community service,

22:43.657 --> 22:46.091
and congratulate him on his retirement.

22:46.093 --> 22:49.177
But how can I do justice
in such a short time?

22:49.179 --> 22:52.014
Mr. Hollingsworth, you've
given me a wonderful idea.

22:52.016 --> 22:54.683
I move that the five minute
limit be waived

22:54.685 --> 22:57.502
so that councilman Bostwick
can be saluted properly

22:57.504 --> 22:58.670
by the public.

22:58.672 --> 23:00.555
Rules are meant to be broken
on occasions

23:00.557 --> 23:03.475
- as sentimental as this.
- Thoughtful as ever, Blythe.

23:03.477 --> 23:04.893
[Chuckling]

23:04.895 --> 23:07.896
I first met Warren
when I was four years old,

23:07.898 --> 23:10.399
on the monkey bars
at St. Barnabas preschool.

23:10.401 --> 23:13.685
I am so sorry for the confusion,

23:13.687 --> 23:15.871
but we only have the six rooms,

23:15.873 --> 23:19.574
and when Dr. Sacani...
lovely name, by the way...

23:19.576 --> 23:21.209
cancelled his reservation,

23:21.211 --> 23:24.212
that room was snatched up in no time.

23:25.364 --> 23:28.000
But, as you can see,

23:28.002 --> 23:31.086
Ms. Katdare's suite is rather roomy.

23:31.088 --> 23:33.538
And with a pull-out...
not that a pull-out

23:33.540 --> 23:36.174
is ever gonna scream "luxury"...

23:36.176 --> 23:38.376
I won't oversell it. I can't sleep here.

23:38.378 --> 23:40.062
[Sighs]
I'll take the sofa bed.

23:40.064 --> 23:42.681
No, I'll call a cab.
[Grunts]

23:42.683 --> 23:45.150
Could you give us a few minutes?

23:45.152 --> 23:48.353
Take your time.
[Door closes]

23:49.689 --> 23:53.058
What's wrong with you?

23:53.060 --> 23:56.945
This entire trip, you have been
so brusque with me.

23:56.947 --> 23:59.448
Look, if I have done something
to upset you,

23:59.450 --> 24:02.617
just tell me, because honestly...

24:02.619 --> 24:06.455
I cannot take this anymore.

24:06.457 --> 24:09.541
I miss the old Jeremiah.

24:09.543 --> 24:12.127
The one without the beard. The...

24:14.680 --> 24:16.681
the one who was my friend.

24:27.110 --> 24:31.113
[Water running]

24:32.448 --> 24:34.449
I love you.

24:42.274 --> 24:45.577
And now, there's a large swarm of bees

24:45.579 --> 24:47.412
circling around my house.

24:47.414 --> 24:50.215
Eh, must be several hundreds of them.

24:50.217 --> 24:54.753
I believe the hour allotted
for public comment is over.

24:54.755 --> 24:58.173
All: d For he's a jolly good fellow d

24:58.175 --> 25:01.292
- d For he's a jolly good fellow
- Excuse me, sorry, I'm sorry.

25:01.294 --> 25:04.563
It's actually not closed because
there's over a minute left,

25:04.565 --> 25:06.648
and my name's on the sign-in
sheet, Evan R. Lawson.

25:06.650 --> 25:09.317
- He's right.
- Very well.

25:09.319 --> 25:12.154
- Take your minute.
- Thank you very much.

25:12.156 --> 25:13.488
- Appreciate that.
- You're very welcome.

25:13.490 --> 25:14.940
49 seconds.

25:14.942 --> 25:17.475
40... I have a minute, right?

25:17.477 --> 25:18.577
No, you had a minute when you stood up

25:18.579 --> 25:19.661
and said you had a minute,

25:19.663 --> 25:21.696
now you have 37 seconds.

25:21.698 --> 25:25.150
- She's right.
- Thanks.

25:25.152 --> 25:27.152
Great.
[Clears throat]

25:27.154 --> 25:30.122
So, Hankmed has been in business
for two full years,

25:30.124 --> 25:32.207
serving the community,
providing medical services

25:32.209 --> 25:33.708
when and where our patients need it.

25:33.710 --> 25:35.710
Its impact on the neighborhood
has been minimal,

25:35.712 --> 25:37.596
vastly outweighed by
the advantages it provides,

25:37.598 --> 25:39.848
because wouldn't you like
to know that day or night,

25:39.850 --> 25:41.433
in an emergency, that you could be seen

25:41.435 --> 25:43.101
by a professional neighborhood doctor?

25:43.103 --> 25:44.803
As opposed to having
to drag your sick self

25:44.805 --> 25:46.721
to the local E.R.? Well, guess what.

25:46.723 --> 25:49.357
Our neighbors would,
which is why all but one of them

25:49.359 --> 25:51.693
signed this petition
to grant Hankmed a zoning waiver

25:51.695 --> 25:53.028
that would allow Hankmed

25:53.030 --> 25:54.779
to continue to serve
the great historic township

25:54.781 --> 25:56.114
of Southampton in the manner

25:56.116 --> 25:57.566
that it not only expects, but deserves.

25:57.568 --> 25:58.817
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Evan R. Lawson,

25:58.819 --> 26:02.304
private citizen of the Hamptons,
and I thank you!

26:09.262 --> 26:11.396
[Indistinct whispering]

26:12.548 --> 26:13.815
Sorry, what is she saying?

26:13.817 --> 26:17.185
Mr. Lawson, we would be happy
to consider your waiver

26:17.187 --> 26:19.404
pending an environmental impact study

26:19.406 --> 26:22.858
on the effects of medical waste
in a residential neighborhood.

26:24.226 --> 26:25.911
Okay. How long will that take?

26:25.913 --> 26:29.230
Oh, not long. Six months to a year.

26:33.441 --> 26:34.574
No, no.

26:34.576 --> 26:35.876
Just please tell me you didn't...

26:35.878 --> 26:39.379
Less speaking and more playing.

26:39.381 --> 26:42.349
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Hank.

26:42.351 --> 26:45.385
Checkmate.

26:45.387 --> 26:49.306
Can't be late for my date
with Milos, can I?

26:49.308 --> 26:51.858
- Dima.
- Huh?

26:51.860 --> 26:57.397
[Both speaking Russian]

27:00.201 --> 27:01.601
As you have learned, Hank,

27:01.603 --> 27:04.604
my relationship with Dmitry
is very complicated.

27:04.606 --> 27:07.290
Well, brothers are never simple.

27:10.444 --> 27:13.413
I connected the dots on
your family's medical history.

27:15.416 --> 27:16.833
I'm impressed.

27:16.835 --> 27:19.386
What I don't understand
is why it's a secret.

27:20.621 --> 27:23.289
Yes.

27:23.291 --> 27:25.225
A mandate, from our mother.

27:26.627 --> 27:27.794
When I was quite young,

27:27.796 --> 27:32.849
my mother had an affair
that produced Dmitry.

27:32.851 --> 27:34.317
My father, understandably,

27:34.319 --> 27:36.486
would not allow him
to be raised in our home,

27:36.488 --> 27:38.939
so, my aunt... my mother's sister...

27:38.941 --> 27:43.110
brought him up in their native Russia.

27:43.112 --> 27:46.947
After my father died, my mother
told us we were brothers

27:46.949 --> 27:49.499
but that no one could ever know.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.119
From that day on, we forged a bond

27:52.121 --> 27:54.654
under the cloak of friendship.

27:54.656 --> 27:57.958
And, as we can see,

27:57.960 --> 27:59.376
my mother was quite right not to trust

27:59.378 --> 28:01.378
my father's side of the family.

28:02.513 --> 28:04.848
Which brings us to Milos.

28:07.835 --> 28:09.836
How can I help?

28:11.806 --> 28:16.026
You can return to Shadow Pond

28:16.028 --> 28:18.612
and pretend that I am still quite dead.

28:28.289 --> 28:29.689
Good morning.

28:29.691 --> 28:32.192
I was wondering if Dr. Lee
had any openings today?

28:32.194 --> 28:34.411
[Sighs]
Let me check.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.413
I am willing to wait.

28:38.583 --> 28:40.250
Why don't you have a seat?

28:40.252 --> 28:41.868
I'll fit you in as soon as possible.

28:41.870 --> 28:44.554
Thank you.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.591
That's the first out for the Sand Gnats.

28:47.593 --> 28:50.010
At the bottom of the ninth,
the score is tied 2-2

28:50.012 --> 28:51.978
and two men on base.

28:54.315 --> 28:56.216
Anyone in particular catch your eye?

28:59.487 --> 29:02.239
Jeff Marston. You a... you a scout, too?

29:02.241 --> 29:06.159
Oh, uh, Jeremiah. I'm not with any club.

29:06.161 --> 29:07.661
Now up to bat, Moe Gilley.
[Cheering]

29:07.663 --> 29:10.280
Hitting 298 with 14 RBIs

29:10.282 --> 29:13.066
and 8 home runs so far this season.

29:13.068 --> 29:16.036
Moe Gilley, what do you think?

29:16.038 --> 29:18.571
Solid fielder. Great switch hitter.

29:18.573 --> 29:21.741
Yeah, he's great when he's patient,

29:21.743 --> 29:23.677
but I bet this pitcher knows

29:23.679 --> 29:26.129
Moe is a sucker
for a first pitch fastball.

29:26.131 --> 29:28.715
[Cheers and applause]

29:31.269 --> 29:33.436
I'm guessing Tripp
just told Moe the same thing.

29:33.438 --> 29:36.856
No. No, Moe will swing.

29:36.858 --> 29:40.610
Moe Gilley, up to bat.

29:40.612 --> 29:43.613
And Clark delivers a fast
curveball over the plate...

29:43.615 --> 29:45.431
Strike one.

29:45.433 --> 29:48.434
You called it, and the kid
definitely took Tripp's advice.

29:50.121 --> 29:51.771
[Crack]
Fastball over the plate.

29:51.773 --> 29:53.240
Just what Moe was looking for.
[Cheers and applause]

29:53.242 --> 29:55.292
He singles to short left field.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.993
The bases are now loaded.

29:56.995 --> 29:59.746
You know, it's such a shame.

29:59.748 --> 30:02.632
One of the smartest players
I've ever seen.

30:02.634 --> 30:07.287
19 years ago, Tripp was the guy
every scout wanted.

30:07.289 --> 30:09.256
What happened?

30:09.258 --> 30:10.957
Well, every year there was
always one player

30:10.959 --> 30:13.343
that was better than him.

30:13.345 --> 30:15.228
Got to hand it to him, though.

30:15.230 --> 30:17.397
I mean, most players
Tripp's age would have

30:17.399 --> 30:20.517
thrown in the towel years ago.

30:20.519 --> 30:24.804
Doby is batting a .256
against Franklin this season.

30:24.806 --> 30:26.022
Unh!

30:26.024 --> 30:27.974
And he gets hit!
[Crowd reacts]

30:27.976 --> 30:30.493
That will force in the game-winning run!

30:30.495 --> 30:33.446
[Cheers and applause]

30:41.088 --> 30:43.823
Is something wrong?

30:43.825 --> 30:45.992
Dima.

30:45.994 --> 30:49.262
He's late.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.264
[Vehicle pulling up]

31:02.026 --> 31:04.561
Why did you bring me here?

31:06.614 --> 31:09.316
You've been spending
a lot of time here, haven't you?

31:09.318 --> 31:13.286
[Speaks Russian]
What's Dmitry saying?

31:13.288 --> 31:15.688
He's trying to divert Milos's suspicions

31:15.690 --> 31:19.859
away from discovering us.
[Speaks Russian]

31:19.861 --> 31:23.163
Says it's for both their benefits.

31:23.165 --> 31:26.699
He would never betray Milos.

31:26.701 --> 31:27.834
It's handled.

31:27.836 --> 31:29.669
[Van door closes]
Good.

31:36.710 --> 31:39.929
Dima!

31:39.931 --> 31:42.232
Dmitry!

31:42.234 --> 31:43.983
Dmitry.

31:43.985 --> 31:46.936
Dmitry. Dmitry!

31:46.938 --> 31:50.890
[Speaking Hungarian]

31:50.892 --> 31:52.025
His pulse is weak.

31:52.027 --> 31:54.727
Yeah.

31:54.729 --> 31:57.730
He's losing blood, fast.

31:59.885 --> 32:01.268
How is it?

32:01.270 --> 32:03.721
His liver is lacerated.
The bleeding is bad.

32:03.723 --> 32:05.906
Maybe if I can clamp off
the hepatic artery...

32:05.908 --> 32:07.408
Do it! Dima, hey, hey.

32:07.410 --> 32:09.560
Save your strength, Dima, okay?

32:09.562 --> 32:11.612
[Grunts]
It's gonna be okay.

32:11.614 --> 32:14.031
Hey, hey.

32:14.033 --> 32:16.617
Okay, got it!

32:16.619 --> 32:18.202
Close the bleed, Hank.

32:18.204 --> 32:20.037
- Yep, I know.
- Hank!

32:20.039 --> 32:22.072
Ah! I can't get the bleeding to stop.

32:22.074 --> 32:25.092
There must be another vessel involved.

32:25.094 --> 32:27.044
- Come on.
- Dima. Dima, hey.

32:27.046 --> 32:30.297
With me, all right?
[Grunting]

32:30.299 --> 32:31.749
I can't...

32:31.751 --> 32:34.018
I can't find it.

32:34.020 --> 32:36.020
He's getting pale, Hank.

32:39.257 --> 32:41.258
Huh?

32:42.394 --> 32:44.729
- What is that?
- An antihemorrhagic.

32:44.731 --> 32:46.597
- A quick clotting agent.
- Good.

32:46.599 --> 32:47.898
Come on, you stay here.

32:47.900 --> 32:48.783
- Come on.
- Going home, Dima.

32:48.785 --> 32:52.286
[Speaking Russian]

32:52.288 --> 32:53.771
Stay here with me, okay?

32:53.773 --> 32:56.607
- Dima.
- You already died.

32:56.609 --> 32:59.126
- Now it's my turn.
- Dima. Dima.

32:59.128 --> 33:00.961
No. No.

33:00.963 --> 33:02.747
Hey, Dima, you stay with me, okay?

33:02.749 --> 33:05.616
Dima? Dima!

33:05.618 --> 33:07.134
- Dima! Dima, Dima, Dima, Dima!
- Boris.

33:07.136 --> 33:09.754
- Boris!
- Dima, stay here!

33:20.348 --> 33:23.334
[Sirens approaching]

33:34.409 --> 33:36.026
You shouldn't be out here.

33:36.028 --> 33:37.545
Look, I'm pretty sure
I know what you're thinking,

33:37.547 --> 33:38.629
but revenge is not the answer.

33:38.631 --> 33:39.880
You have a brother, have you not?

33:39.882 --> 33:41.198
- Then you can understand.
- I do!

33:41.200 --> 33:42.699
But you and Dmitry had a plan!

33:42.701 --> 33:44.502
Yeah, which Dima
can no longer carry out.

33:44.504 --> 33:46.887
- Boris, don't...
- Hank!

33:46.889 --> 33:50.140
My brother is gone.

33:50.142 --> 33:53.143
He is gone. Yeah?

33:54.479 --> 33:59.016
Yeah. Yeah.
[Church bell ringing]

33:59.018 --> 34:01.318
Milos will be held accountable.

34:01.320 --> 34:04.271
- I get it.
- I think, perhaps not.

34:04.273 --> 34:05.322
Okay, let me help.

34:05.324 --> 34:06.607
There is nothing you can do, Hank.

34:06.609 --> 34:09.193
You still don't know
what Milos wants, right?

34:09.195 --> 34:11.395
But maybe I can offer him
something he needs.

34:18.620 --> 34:19.735
Hey, I heard what happened.

34:19.737 --> 34:22.239
- Are you okay?
- His rib is fractured.

34:22.241 --> 34:24.241
- Yeah, I took one for the team.
- Uh, well actually, you didn't

34:24.243 --> 34:26.543
step in front of that ball
on purpose, you stumbled.

34:27.596 --> 34:31.549
Yeah. Yeah, I lost my balance.

34:31.551 --> 34:33.717
This muscle weakness is...
it's getting worse.

34:33.719 --> 34:35.101
What about his E.M.G. results?

34:35.103 --> 34:36.719
They say there's no myopathy.

34:36.722 --> 34:39.974
- Well, what's wrong with me?
- We're gonna find out.

34:39.976 --> 34:42.025
- Did they take a P.A. film?
- No, why?

34:42.027 --> 34:43.694
Because Tripp's problem
may be cardiac in nature.

34:43.696 --> 34:45.779
His heart could be slightly enlarged.

34:45.781 --> 34:46.981
- Are you thinking...
- Cardiomyopathy.

34:46.983 --> 34:48.532
- Yes, or cardiomegaly.
- They need to take

34:48.534 --> 34:50.451
another X-ray.
From a posteroanterior angle.

34:50.453 --> 34:53.103
Both: Yes.

34:59.777 --> 35:02.830
Am I losing my edge? I... like... am I...

35:02.832 --> 35:04.415
I feel like I'm getting soft
or something.

35:04.417 --> 35:06.333
How could I not know Blythe
was on the council?

35:06.335 --> 35:07.801
- Okay.
- Am I crazy?

35:07.803 --> 35:10.170
Forget about Blythe Ballard.

35:10.172 --> 35:11.955
And remember who you are.

35:11.957 --> 35:15.476
Evan R. Lawson, CFO of Hankmed.

35:15.478 --> 35:18.562
You don't mope. You cope.

35:18.564 --> 35:21.465
You don't run from problems.
You solve them.

35:21.467 --> 35:25.586
And you certainly don't waste
the 18 of 72 hours

35:25.588 --> 35:28.822
of alone time we have left,
if you know what I mean,

35:28.824 --> 35:30.424
and I think that you do.

35:30.426 --> 35:33.127
- You're absolutely right.
- I know.

35:33.129 --> 35:34.661
- I'm not gonna mope.
- No.

35:34.663 --> 35:36.347
- Moping's for losers.
- Losers.

35:36.349 --> 35:39.049
- I'm gonna get even!
- Even? Even how?

35:39.051 --> 35:40.884
Remember I told you that
councilman retired last night?

35:40.886 --> 35:42.553
- Yeah?
- Well, there's probably

35:42.555 --> 35:44.722
gonna be some kind of special
election now, right?

35:44.724 --> 35:48.008
- Don't do it, Evan!
- I am gonna do it, Paige.

35:48.010 --> 35:49.643
I'm gonna run for Village Council.

35:49.645 --> 35:51.511
I'm gonna get our waiver granted.

35:51.513 --> 35:54.148
I'm gonna bring democracy
back to the Hamptons.

35:56.985 --> 35:59.787
So, give me the news.

35:59.789 --> 36:01.956
Um, well, Divya's hunch was right.

36:01.958 --> 36:05.159
The different angle on
your torso helped us discover

36:05.161 --> 36:06.627
that you have an enlarged heart,

36:06.629 --> 36:10.247
and combined with the muscle
weakness, it led us to suspect

36:10.249 --> 36:13.033
- Pompe's disease.
- Pompe's disease?

36:13.035 --> 36:14.668
- What's that?
- It's a genetic disorder that

36:14.670 --> 36:17.388
stops the body from making an
enzyme that breaks down sugars,

36:17.390 --> 36:19.673
and then they build up in your body

36:19.675 --> 36:21.675
and it can stop your muscles
from working.

36:23.094 --> 36:24.228
You're sure that's what I have?

36:24.230 --> 36:25.679
The muscle biopsy confirmed it.

36:25.681 --> 36:28.766
You'll be treated with
an enzyme replacement therapy,

36:28.768 --> 36:32.069
but you may not recover your full speed.

36:37.776 --> 36:40.744
Well, you know what?
I'm not gonna need it anyway.

36:40.746 --> 36:42.746
It looks like I'm gonna be
sitting down most of the time,

36:42.748 --> 36:44.231
yelling at the players.

36:44.233 --> 36:45.949
You're giving up on baseball?

36:45.951 --> 36:49.069
No, no, no. I'm going into coaching.

36:49.071 --> 36:50.337
I got a call from the front office.

36:50.339 --> 36:53.040
They said the scout was impressed

36:53.042 --> 36:54.758
with my player development skills,

36:54.760 --> 36:58.512
and they want to groom me
to be a hitting coach.

36:58.514 --> 37:00.964
Well, then you may still
make it to "The Show."

37:00.966 --> 37:03.083
Yeah. Yeah.

37:03.085 --> 37:05.886
I may be an old player.
I'm gonna be a young coach.

37:07.555 --> 37:12.592
- Congratulations, rookie.
- Thank you, man.

37:12.594 --> 37:17.597
So, uh... how come Divya's not here?

37:17.599 --> 37:20.100
I did not invite her.

37:20.102 --> 37:22.769
Would it really be that difficult

37:22.771 --> 37:25.789
for you to just walk up to her
and tell her how you feel?

37:27.492 --> 37:30.577
I made the impossible possible.

37:30.579 --> 37:34.465
Maybe you can too.

37:34.467 --> 37:37.451
It's something to think about.

38:03.500 --> 38:05.501
Divya.

38:07.554 --> 38:09.555
What's wrong?

38:11.625 --> 38:14.727
I never thought it could happen,

38:14.729 --> 38:18.631
so I never let myself want it.

38:20.017 --> 38:22.018
But then it did happen...

38:24.738 --> 38:27.907
And when it almost went away
just as quickly...

38:30.160 --> 38:33.479
I was terrified.

38:33.481 --> 38:38.284
I should have known that meant
I really want this.

38:40.921 --> 38:45.658
And when Dr. Lee told me that
my HCG levels were rising...

38:47.678 --> 38:50.847
and...

38:50.849 --> 38:53.599
everything was gonna be okay...

38:55.836 --> 39:00.523
then I started crying.

39:00.525 --> 39:03.643
[Cries]
And I couldn't stop.

39:03.645 --> 39:07.346
So, uh...

39:07.348 --> 39:09.866
now I know...

39:09.868 --> 39:12.151
how much I want this.

39:14.371 --> 39:18.825
How much I have always wanted this.

39:20.711 --> 39:24.864
And I'm gonna do it...

39:24.866 --> 39:26.582
I'm gonna have a baby.

39:26.584 --> 39:29.585
You're gonna have a baby.

39:36.260 --> 39:38.043
I'm sorry. I'm sure...

39:38.045 --> 39:40.346
you don't want to know anything
about this.

39:40.348 --> 39:42.348
Tell me.

39:45.152 --> 39:47.153
Tell me everything.

39:54.361 --> 39:57.747
[Phone rings]

39:57.749 --> 39:59.565
Oh, hey! You at the airport?

39:59.567 --> 40:02.502
Uh, not yet.
I just wanted to call and say

40:02.504 --> 40:05.204
I was thinking about you.

40:05.206 --> 40:06.923
Oh.

40:06.925 --> 40:08.791
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

40:08.793 --> 40:12.295
I just, uh... I miss
my little brother, that's all.

40:12.297 --> 40:16.766
Okay. I miss you, too.

40:16.768 --> 40:19.468
Hank, I... I didn't fix anything.

40:19.470 --> 40:21.938
I don't care, as long as you're okay.

40:21.940 --> 40:25.608
But, I am running for Village Council.

40:25.610 --> 40:27.143
Of course you are.

40:27.145 --> 40:30.279
You'll tell me all about it
when I see you tomorrow.

40:34.952 --> 40:36.435
Thank you again, Mary Kay.

40:36.437 --> 40:38.270
Oh, any thanks go to you.

40:38.272 --> 40:40.623
I heard how the two of you
helped Tripp Doby.

40:40.625 --> 40:43.042
- He's my favorite Sand Gnat.
- Ours, too.

40:43.044 --> 40:45.161
And when I see Dr. Sacani,
I will tell him.

40:45.163 --> 40:46.612
Wha... no need to, darling.

40:46.614 --> 40:48.464
He showed up at the hospital
over an hour ago.

40:48.466 --> 40:49.999
Now, listen, you wait here
while I get the car.

40:50.001 --> 40:52.001
Dr. Sacani should be done by then.

40:52.003 --> 40:53.135
Uh, done with what?

40:53.137 --> 40:55.454
I'll be right back.

40:55.456 --> 40:57.456
Hello, Divya.

40:59.343 --> 41:01.427
Jeremiah.

41:01.429 --> 41:03.763
I almost didn't recognize you.

41:10.320 --> 41:13.138
- Hank!
- Milos.

41:13.140 --> 41:16.192
This is my friend, Ajuja. Ajuja, Hank.

41:16.194 --> 41:18.611
Nice to meet you.

41:19.646 --> 41:22.248
You are still in Budapest.

41:22.250 --> 41:25.368
I leave soon, but first
I wanted to give you this.

41:25.370 --> 41:27.119
It's information I found

41:27.121 --> 41:29.922
on intramedullary solutions
for bone fractures.

41:31.324 --> 41:35.761
- Thank you.
- I also made a phone call.

41:35.763 --> 41:39.298
There may be a clinical trial
available for your condition.

41:39.300 --> 41:41.133
Before Boris died, I was exploring it,

41:41.135 --> 41:42.501
but if you're interested,

41:42.503 --> 41:45.021
I can see if you meet
the inclusion criteria.

41:45.023 --> 41:49.058
I can see why Boris
appreciated you so much.

41:49.060 --> 41:51.277
Great. Great.
Well, I just need some time

41:51.279 --> 41:54.780
to catch up on
the current protocol, but...

41:54.782 --> 41:58.117
I am looking forward
to partnering with you, Hank.

41:58.119 --> 42:01.353
I hope this experience
will be a success.

42:05.959 --> 42:09.128
I couldn't agree more.
