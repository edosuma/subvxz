00:01.291 --> 00:04.959
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:01.291 --> 00:04.959
<i>Stardate 43685.2:</i>

00:04.959 --> 00:07.041
<i>As part of</i>

00:04.959 --> 00:07.041
<i>an exchange program,</i>

00:07.041 --> 00:09.125
<i>we are taking aboard</i>

00:07.041 --> 00:09.125
<i>a Klingon officer</i>

00:09.125 --> 00:11.667
<i>to return the recent visit</i>

00:09.125 --> 00:11.667
<i>of Commander Riker</i>

00:11.667 --> 00:13.375
<i>to the Cruiser</i> Pagh.

00:13.375 --> 00:15.166
We must take care of him

00:13.375 --> 00:15.166
while he's with us.

00:15.166 --> 00:17.917
Commander Kurn is accorded all

00:15.166 --> 00:17.917
the rights and responsibilities

00:17.917 --> 00:20.291
due to a first officer

00:17.917 --> 00:20.291
on board this ship.

00:20.291 --> 00:22.125
If he should feel

00:20.291 --> 00:22.125
patronized in any way...

00:22.125 --> 00:23.625
Oh, I'm sure we'd know.

00:23.625 --> 00:26.792
One does not patronize

00:23.625 --> 00:26.792
a Klingon warrior.

00:26.792 --> 00:30.041
Your experience on board

00:26.792 --> 00:30.041
the<i> Pagh</i> will prove invaluable

00:30.041 --> 00:31.625
during the Commander's tour.

00:31.625 --> 00:34.250
Be sure the crew are prepared

00:31.625 --> 00:34.250
for any unusual orders.

00:34.250 --> 00:36.041
The Klingons

00:34.250 --> 00:36.041
are very thorough.

00:36.041 --> 00:38.500
I'm sure Commander Kurn

00:36.041 --> 00:38.500
has studied for his assignment

00:38.500 --> 00:40.125
just as I did

00:38.500 --> 00:40.125
when I served with them.

00:40.125 --> 00:43.083
I understand he requested

00:40.125 --> 00:43.083
the<i> Enterprise</i> specifically.

00:44.417 --> 00:47.083
Commander Kurn is ready

00:44.417 --> 00:47.083
for transport, Captain.

00:47.083 --> 00:49.542
Energize.

01:01.166 --> 01:03.417
Welcome aboard

01:01.166 --> 01:03.417
the<i> Enterprise,</i> Commander.

01:03.417 --> 01:04.583
I'm Captain Picard.

01:04.583 --> 01:06.125
This is Commander

01:04.583 --> 01:06.125
William Riker.

01:06.125 --> 01:08.417
He will be yielding

01:06.125 --> 01:08.417
the first officer's position

01:08.417 --> 01:10.625
to you during your tour.

01:10.625 --> 01:13.041
You are relieved.

01:13.041 --> 01:14.500
May I take my station, sir?

01:14.500 --> 01:17.417
I thought I might show you

01:14.500 --> 01:17.417
to your quarters first.

01:17.417 --> 01:19.625
I am ready for duty, sir.

01:19.625 --> 01:22.250
I ask that I be allowed

01:19.625 --> 01:22.250
to take my station.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.667
Very well.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.375
If you will accompany us

01:23.667 --> 01:25.375
to the Bridge.

01:34.709 --> 01:36.542
I am Kurn,

01:36.542 --> 01:39.625
commander rank,

01:36.542 --> 01:39.625
Klingon Defense Force.

01:39.625 --> 01:43.417
You will address me

01:39.625 --> 01:43.417
as "Commander" or "sir"

01:39.625 --> 01:43.417
at all times.

01:43.417 --> 01:46.583
I am fully aware

01:43.417 --> 01:46.583
of all Starfleet regulations

01:46.583 --> 01:50.166
and they will be strictly

01:46.583 --> 01:50.166
adhered to by all personnel

01:50.166 --> 01:52.166
while I am in command.

01:52.166 --> 01:55.458
It is my intention to bring

01:52.166 --> 01:55.458
a sense of discipline

01:55.458 --> 01:57.959
that you may not

01:55.458 --> 01:57.959
be accustomed to.

01:57.959 --> 02:00.083
With your permission,

01:57.959 --> 02:00.083
of course, Captain.

02:00.083 --> 02:02.250
Oh, by all means, Commander.

02:02.250 --> 02:05.291
I have studied

02:02.250 --> 02:05.291
all of your Starfleet records.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.834
Impressive.

02:06.834 --> 02:09.583
We shall see if you live up

02:06.834 --> 02:09.583
to your reputations.

02:09.583 --> 02:11.667
(<i> whispering</i> )

02:11.667 --> 02:16.333
Do you wish to speak

02:11.667 --> 02:16.333
Acting Ensign Wesley Crusher?

02:16.333 --> 02:18.667
No, sir, Commander, sir.

02:20.166 --> 02:23.375
The crew awaits your orders,

02:20.166 --> 02:23.375
Captain.

02:25.959 --> 02:29.083
Then take us to the outer

02:25.959 --> 02:29.083
cometary cloud, Commander.

02:34.625 --> 02:38.125
Set course 114,

02:34.625 --> 02:38.125
mark 230.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.291
One-third

02:38.125 --> 02:40.291
impulse power.

02:40.291 --> 02:41.250
Aye, sir.

02:41.250 --> 02:42.875
Execute.

02:42.875 --> 02:44.500
Engaged.

02:44.500 --> 02:47.208
Increasing to one-third

02:44.500 --> 02:47.208
impulse power, sir.

03:21.208 --> 03:25.125
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

03:25.125 --> 03:29.333
<i>These are the voyages</i>

03:25.125 --> 03:29.333
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

03:29.333 --> 03:31.208
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

03:31.208 --> 03:34.959
<i>to explore</i>

03:31.208 --> 03:34.959
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

03:34.959 --> 03:39.750
<i>to seek out new life</i>

03:34.959 --> 03:39.750
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

03:39.750 --> 03:44.417
<i>to boldly go</i>

03:39.750 --> 03:44.417
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

04:55.166 --> 04:58.166
Mind if I join you?

04:55.166 --> 04:58.166
No, sir.

04:58.166 --> 05:01.625
Is there something wrong, Wes?

04:58.166 --> 05:01.625
Commander Kurn, perhaps?

05:03.166 --> 05:05.291
He just doesn't

05:03.166 --> 05:05.291
seem to like me.

05:05.291 --> 05:08.041
I can't do anything

05:05.291 --> 05:08.041
right for him.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.792
Every time I respond

05:08.041 --> 05:09.792
to an order,

05:09.792 --> 05:11.208
he jumps down my throat.

05:11.208 --> 05:14.041
I don't know

05:11.208 --> 05:14.041
what I'm doing wrong.

05:14.041 --> 05:16.250
Problem, Geordi?

05:14.041 --> 05:16.250
Yes, sir.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.333
It's our

05:16.250 --> 05:18.333
new First Officer.

05:18.333 --> 05:20.458
I take it he found something

05:18.333 --> 05:20.458
wrong with Engineering.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.125
Just the entire section.

05:22.125 --> 05:23.375
He pulled

05:22.125 --> 05:23.375
a surprise inspection

05:23.375 --> 05:25.208
in the middle of

05:23.375 --> 05:25.208
a maintenance cycle.

05:25.208 --> 05:27.709
I tried to explain

05:25.208 --> 05:27.709
it to him, but...

05:25.208 --> 05:27.709
But he wouldn't listen.

05:27.709 --> 05:29.333
We're all going to be doing

05:27.709 --> 05:29.333
double shifts down there

05:29.333 --> 05:31.375
just to get ready

05:29.333 --> 05:31.375
for the next inspection.

05:31.375 --> 05:33.208
(<i> sighs</i> )

05:33.208 --> 05:35.250
His style of command

05:33.208 --> 05:35.250
is just different.

05:35.250 --> 05:37.250
Klingons believe in obedience

05:37.250 --> 05:39.041
and a strict formality

05:37.250 --> 05:39.041
of command.

05:39.041 --> 05:42.250
Yeah, but this isn't

05:39.041 --> 05:42.250
a Klingon vessel.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.208
He's going to have

05:42.250 --> 05:44.208
to loosen up, Commander.

05:44.208 --> 05:46.041
WESLEY:

05:44.208 --> 05:46.041
And it's not just us.

05:46.041 --> 05:49.792
He's been leaning into everybody

05:46.041 --> 05:49.792
pretty hard, except...

05:49.792 --> 05:52.542
Except the one guy

05:49.792 --> 05:52.542
who wouldn't really mind it.

05:53.375 --> 05:55.083
(<i> console beeping</i> )

05:55.083 --> 05:57.375
Sensors picking up asteroidal

05:55.083 --> 05:57.375
debris ahead, Commander.

05:57.375 --> 06:00.417
Can you identify

05:57.375 --> 06:00.417
the coordinates, Mr. Worf?

06:00.417 --> 06:03.542
Bearing 001,

06:00.417 --> 06:03.542
mark .03

06:03.542 --> 06:05.625
Range--

06:03.542 --> 06:05.625
300,000 kilometers.

06:05.625 --> 06:07.542
Excellent.

06:10.208 --> 06:13.458
Please scan the asteroid field

06:10.208 --> 06:13.458
for me, Lieutenant,

06:13.458 --> 06:15.458
and report.

06:17.458 --> 06:20.166
Approximately

06:17.458 --> 06:20.166
2,000 small objects.

06:20.166 --> 06:22.250
None directly in

06:20.166 --> 06:22.250
our flight path, sir.

06:22.250 --> 06:24.834
So no course correction

06:22.250 --> 06:24.834
is necessary.

06:24.834 --> 06:26.500
Is that what you are saying?

06:26.500 --> 06:28.041
It should not be needed, sir.

06:28.041 --> 06:30.291
Very good, Lieutenant.

06:30.291 --> 06:32.375
You handled that well.

06:33.625 --> 06:36.083
Yes?

06:48.792 --> 06:50.875
Commander.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.500
Captain's mess?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.500
Yes.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.000
Resume.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.208
Your knowledge of

07:00.000 --> 07:02.208
our systems and procedures

07:02.208 --> 07:04.375
is very impressive.

07:04.375 --> 07:06.166
Sir.

07:06.166 --> 07:09.709
I would like to make

07:06.166 --> 07:09.709
one suggestion, sir.

07:09.709 --> 07:11.417
A suggestion?

07:11.417 --> 07:13.583
When I served aboard the<i> Pagh,</i>

07:13.583 --> 07:17.333
the hardest part for me

07:13.583 --> 07:17.333
was recognizing and adapting

07:17.333 --> 07:19.417
to the demands of the crew.

07:19.417 --> 07:21.291
They needed an iron hand.

07:21.291 --> 07:23.291
I imagine it must be

07:21.291 --> 07:23.291
very difficult for you

07:23.291 --> 07:26.041
to work with a crew

07:23.291 --> 07:26.041
that is... so different.

07:26.041 --> 07:28.625
I would be happy

07:26.041 --> 07:28.625
to guide you in that regard

07:28.625 --> 07:30.166
if it would be helpful.

07:30.166 --> 07:33.875
No, Commander,

07:30.166 --> 07:33.875
it wouldn't.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.542
This is not

07:39.000 --> 07:42.542
a Klingon ship, sir.

07:42.542 --> 07:46.166
No, Commander,

07:42.542 --> 07:46.166
it is not.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.667
If it were a Klingon ship,

07:48.667 --> 07:51.875
I would have killed you

07:48.667 --> 07:51.875
for offering your suggestion.

08:00.667 --> 08:03.542
How long has

08:00.667 --> 08:03.542
this bird been dead?

08:03.542 --> 08:06.959
It appears to have been lying

08:03.542 --> 08:06.959
in the sun for quite some time.

08:06.959 --> 08:09.583
Well, it's not<i> dead.</i>

08:06.959 --> 08:09.583
It's been replicated and...

08:09.583 --> 08:12.959
You do understand that

08:09.583 --> 08:12.959
we cook most of our foods.

08:12.959 --> 08:16.125
Ah, yes, I was told

08:12.959 --> 08:16.125
to prepare for that.

08:16.125 --> 08:21.041
I shall try some of your

08:16.125 --> 08:21.041
burned, replicated bird meat.

08:21.041 --> 08:23.166
I have attempted

08:21.041 --> 08:23.166
to select a menu

08:23.166 --> 08:26.542
that will allow you to sample

08:23.166 --> 08:26.542
a variety of dishes, Commander.

08:26.542 --> 08:28.834
Try some caviar.

08:32.792 --> 08:35.750
(<i> growls</i> )

08:32.792 --> 08:35.750
The odor is not palatable.

08:35.750 --> 08:37.291
What is it?

08:37.291 --> 08:39.959
The unhatched eggs

08:37.291 --> 08:39.959
of a large, scaleless...

08:39.959 --> 08:42.375
Later, Data.

08:39.959 --> 08:42.375
A fish, Commander.

08:42.375 --> 08:45.625
A delicacy from

08:42.375 --> 08:45.625
the Caspian Sea on Earth.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.458
It's a favorite of mine.

08:47.458 --> 08:49.458
Our replicator has

08:47.458 --> 08:49.458
never done it justice,

08:49.458 --> 08:53.417
but I manage to store a few

08:49.458 --> 08:53.417
cases for special occasions.

08:53.417 --> 08:56.333
I am... honored, Captain.

09:10.333 --> 09:12.417
Are you adjusting

09:12.417 --> 09:14.208
to your new environment,

09:12.417 --> 09:14.208
Commander?

09:14.208 --> 09:17.750
I find the constraints

09:14.208 --> 09:17.750
a bit difficult to conform to.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.041
Just a short while ago,

09:21.041 --> 09:23.458
I had to stop myself

09:21.041 --> 09:23.458
from killing Commander Riker.

09:23.458 --> 09:25.125
(<i> laughs</i> )

09:25.125 --> 09:26.875
I believed he was

09:25.125 --> 09:26.875
trying to communicate

09:26.875 --> 09:29.959
the crew's sense of discomfort

09:26.875 --> 09:29.959
with my style of command.

09:29.959 --> 09:32.083
Under normal circumstances,

09:32.083 --> 09:35.875
I would consider that

09:32.083 --> 09:35.875
a challenge to my authority.

09:35.875 --> 09:38.417
One of the aims of

09:35.875 --> 09:38.417
the exchange program, Commander,

09:38.417 --> 09:40.709
is for us all

09:38.417 --> 09:40.709
to learn tolerance.

09:40.709 --> 09:42.834
As for my crew,

09:40.709 --> 09:42.834
it may be healthy

09:42.834 --> 09:45.166
to shake up the status quo

09:42.834 --> 09:45.166
occasionally.

09:45.166 --> 09:47.709
The Commander

09:45.166 --> 09:47.709
certainly appears

09:47.709 --> 09:50.542
to have the crew

09:47.709 --> 09:50.542
on its toes, sir.

09:50.542 --> 09:51.917
And then some.

09:51.917 --> 09:54.250
No offense, sir.

09:54.250 --> 09:55.875
None taken.

09:55.875 --> 09:59.208
I never kill anyone at

09:55.875 --> 09:59.208
the supper table, Mr. La Forge.

10:04.750 --> 10:06.667
Don't you like it, Commander?

10:06.667 --> 10:09.583
Our food has much

10:06.667 --> 10:09.583
more<i> taste</i> to it.

10:09.583 --> 10:12.542
While I'm sure

10:09.583 --> 10:12.542
this is well-prepared,

10:12.542 --> 10:14.583
it is much too bland

10:14.583 --> 10:18.041
for the stomach

10:14.583 --> 10:18.041
of a Klingon.

10:18.041 --> 10:20.125
It seems to agree with Worf.

10:21.125 --> 10:23.291
Yes.

10:31.917 --> 10:33.959
(<i> door chimes</i> )

10:35.959 --> 10:37.959
Enter.

10:39.959 --> 10:41.959
<i>'el.</i>

10:44.875 --> 10:47.375
Permission to

10:44.875 --> 10:47.375
speak freely, sir.

10:47.375 --> 10:49.125
For what purpose?

10:49.125 --> 10:51.959
I have questions

10:49.125 --> 10:51.959
I wish to pose.

10:53.458 --> 10:56.834
Are your quarters

10:53.458 --> 10:56.834
so<i> comfortable?</i>

10:56.834 --> 10:58.834
They serve me.

11:00.709 --> 11:03.750
This entire ship

11:00.709 --> 11:03.750
seems built on

11:03.750 --> 11:06.917
comfort, relaxation...

11:06.917 --> 11:08.625
being at ease.

11:08.625 --> 11:11.542
It is not the ship

11:08.625 --> 11:11.542
of a warrior.

11:11.542 --> 11:15.583
Not the ship of a Klingon.

11:18.709 --> 11:21.625
You cannot ask these questions

11:21.625 --> 11:23.917
within the boundaries

11:21.625 --> 11:23.917
of protocol?

11:23.917 --> 11:26.959
They are of a...

11:26.959 --> 11:29.500
personal nature, sir.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.709
Permission granted.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.709
Pose your questions.

11:32.709 --> 11:36.083
I wish to know

11:32.709 --> 11:36.083
if I have given you offense.

11:36.083 --> 11:37.709
I am not human.

11:37.709 --> 11:40.583
If you had given offense,

11:37.709 --> 11:40.583
you would not need to ask.

11:40.583 --> 11:44.125
Perhaps I have not performed

11:40.583 --> 11:44.125
my duties to<i> your</i> satisfaction.

11:44.125 --> 11:47.834
I find you to be

11:44.125 --> 11:47.834
a capable Starfleet officer,

11:47.834 --> 11:50.291
a credit to your ship.

11:50.291 --> 11:54.000
Yet, you dishonor me

11:50.291 --> 11:54.000
at every opportunity.

11:55.458 --> 11:57.083
Have I?

11:57.083 --> 12:01.000
I did not know that being

11:57.083 --> 12:01.000
polite to a Starfleet officer

12:01.000 --> 12:02.959
would bring dishonor to him.

12:02.959 --> 12:04.917
I am a Klingon.

12:04.917 --> 12:06.041
Really?

12:06.041 --> 12:09.291
Perhaps your blood

12:06.041 --> 12:09.291
has thinned

12:09.291 --> 12:11.625
in this environment.

12:14.333 --> 12:17.375
I simply didn't

12:14.333 --> 12:17.375
want to hurt you.

12:17.375 --> 12:18.375
(<i> yells</i> )

12:18.375 --> 12:20.041
<i>mev yap!</i>

12:21.750 --> 12:24.917
So your blood is not

12:21.750 --> 12:24.917
so thin after all.

12:24.917 --> 12:26.959
I am a<i> Klingon!</i>

12:26.959 --> 12:30.291
If you doubt it,

12:26.959 --> 12:30.291
a demonstration can be arranged.

12:30.291 --> 12:33.750
<i>That</i> is the response

12:30.291 --> 12:33.750
of a Klingon.

12:33.750 --> 12:36.542
The response I

12:33.750 --> 12:36.542
would expect...

12:36.542 --> 12:38.625
from my older brother.

12:45.250 --> 12:47.917
I was barely a year old

12:47.917 --> 12:50.417
when you left

12:47.917 --> 12:50.417
for the Khitomer Outpost.

12:52.041 --> 12:55.333
You, our mother and father

12:52.041 --> 12:55.333
were not going to stay long.

12:55.333 --> 12:58.333
It was decided that I

12:55.333 --> 12:58.333
did not need to go.

12:58.333 --> 13:01.625
I was left to stay with

12:58.333 --> 13:01.625
our father's friend, Lorgh,

13:01.625 --> 13:03.458
until your return.

13:03.458 --> 13:05.291
You never did.

13:07.166 --> 13:10.000
The Starfleet officer

13:07.166 --> 13:10.000
that rescued me

13:10.000 --> 13:13.291
was told by the Klingon

13:10.000 --> 13:13.291
High Command that...

13:13.291 --> 13:16.083
I had no living relatives.

13:16.083 --> 13:19.625
They assumed that I was killed

13:16.083 --> 13:19.625
with the family at Khitomer.

13:19.625 --> 13:21.750
Lorgh had no sons.

13:21.750 --> 13:24.458
He took me into his family.

13:24.458 --> 13:27.709
It was not until I reached

13:24.458 --> 13:27.709
the Age of Ascension

13:27.709 --> 13:29.333
that I was told the truth.

13:29.333 --> 13:30.792
So you asked

13:30.792 --> 13:33.458
to serve aboard

13:30.792 --> 13:33.458
the<i> Enterprise</i> to watch me.

13:33.458 --> 13:35.667
It was an excellent

13:33.458 --> 13:35.667
opportunity

13:35.667 --> 13:37.667
to see what kind

13:35.667 --> 13:37.667
of Klingon you were

13:37.667 --> 13:40.667
or if you were

13:37.667 --> 13:40.667
Klingon at all.

13:40.667 --> 13:43.542
Your deception

13:40.667 --> 13:43.542
offends me, brother.

13:43.542 --> 13:44.792
It should.

13:44.792 --> 13:46.417
But it was required.

13:46.417 --> 13:48.375
To satisfy your curiosity.

13:48.375 --> 13:50.208
No, much more.

13:50.208 --> 13:52.500
You are the eldest son.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.458
The challenge is

13:52.500 --> 13:55.458
yours to make.

13:56.709 --> 13:58.166
Challenge?

13:58.166 --> 14:00.625
The Klingon High Council

14:00.625 --> 14:04.125
has judged our father

14:00.625 --> 14:04.125
a traitor to the Empire.

14:08.083 --> 14:10.875
What are

14:08.083 --> 14:10.875
the allegations, Worf?

14:12.709 --> 14:15.291
My father is accused

14:12.709 --> 14:15.291
of aiding and abetting

14:15.291 --> 14:18.000
the Romulan attack

14:15.291 --> 14:18.000
on the Khitomer Outpost.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.792
The attack in which

14:18.000 --> 14:20.792
he himself was killed?

14:24.750 --> 14:27.375
But why now,

14:24.750 --> 14:27.375
after 20 years?

14:27.375 --> 14:29.041
I do not know,

14:27.375 --> 14:29.041
Captain.

14:29.041 --> 14:31.291
I will hear the evidence

14:29.041 --> 14:31.291
when I arrive.

14:31.291 --> 14:33.208
The charge has

14:31.291 --> 14:33.208
been made by Duras,

14:33.208 --> 14:36.458
the son of my father's

14:33.208 --> 14:36.458
greatest rival.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.834
Our family name

14:36.458 --> 14:38.834
will be disgraced

14:38.834 --> 14:40.333
for seven generations.

14:40.333 --> 14:43.500
It is my responsibility

14:40.333 --> 14:43.500
to clear his name

14:43.500 --> 14:46.333
or answer for his crimes.

14:43.500 --> 14:46.333
Answer for them?

14:46.333 --> 14:49.417
The family of a Klingon warrior

14:49.417 --> 14:51.166
is responsible for his actions

14:51.166 --> 14:53.583
and he is responsible

14:51.166 --> 14:53.583
for theirs.

14:53.583 --> 14:57.542
If I fail in my challenge,

14:53.583 --> 14:57.542
I will be executed.

14:59.667 --> 15:02.333
Will you grant my leave,

14:59.667 --> 15:02.333
Captain?

15:02.333 --> 15:03.709
No.

15:03.709 --> 15:05.542
If I understand correctly,

15:05.542 --> 15:09.542
a Starfleet officer,

15:05.542 --> 15:09.542
a respected member of my crew,

15:09.542 --> 15:12.291
could be accused

15:09.542 --> 15:12.291
of a capital crime.

15:12.291 --> 15:16.375
Your actions in this matter

15:12.291 --> 15:16.375
will reflect on this ship

15:16.375 --> 15:18.041
and on the Federation.

15:18.041 --> 15:20.709
Therefore, it seems

15:18.041 --> 15:20.709
only appropriate

15:20.709 --> 15:23.125
that your Captain

15:20.709 --> 15:23.125
should be at your side

15:23.125 --> 15:26.083
while you make

15:23.125 --> 15:26.083
your challenge.

15:26.083 --> 15:29.083
I'm sure you would do

15:26.083 --> 15:29.083
no less for me.

15:32.250 --> 15:34.333
Commander Kurn.

15:32.250 --> 15:34.333
Sir.

15:34.333 --> 15:35.542
We're changing course.

15:35.542 --> 15:37.458
Set coordinates

15:35.542 --> 15:37.458
for the First City

15:37.458 --> 15:39.542
of the Klingon

15:37.458 --> 15:39.542
Imperial Empire.

15:54.792 --> 15:58.208
We arrive within the hour.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.166
Yes.

16:00.166 --> 16:03.375
The Council will receive you at

16:00.166 --> 16:03.375
high sun in the Great Hall of...

16:03.375 --> 16:05.792
I know the procedure

16:03.375 --> 16:05.792
for the challenge.

16:05.792 --> 16:08.458
You'll need a<i> cha'DIch</i>

16:05.792 --> 16:08.458
to defend you.

16:08.458 --> 16:12.166
While you are accused,

16:08.458 --> 16:12.166
you will not be allowed combat.

16:12.166 --> 16:15.583
I would be honored

16:12.166 --> 16:15.583
if you chose me.

16:18.166 --> 16:22.333
I ask you to stand with me,

16:18.166 --> 16:22.333
to be my<i> cha'DIch.</i>

16:22.333 --> 16:24.333
<i>jIlajneS.</i>

16:24.333 --> 16:27.083
<i>ghIj qet jaghmeyjaj.</i>

16:27.083 --> 16:29.083
The two sons of Mogh--

16:29.083 --> 16:33.125
together, we'll restore

16:29.083 --> 16:33.125
the family honor.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.959
No, for the proceedings,

16:34.959 --> 16:37.166
you will not reveal

16:34.959 --> 16:37.166
your true father.

16:37.166 --> 16:39.333
I must.

16:37.166 --> 16:39.333
You will not.

16:39.333 --> 16:42.917
Because it would mean my death

16:39.333 --> 16:42.917
as well if you fail.

16:42.917 --> 16:46.250
A Klingon's honor means

16:42.917 --> 16:46.250
more to him than his life.

16:46.250 --> 16:50.333
Perhaps your human values

16:46.250 --> 16:50.333
have clouded your judgment.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.125
I insist.

16:52.125 --> 16:54.875
On this ship,

16:52.125 --> 16:54.875
you are my Commander

16:54.875 --> 16:57.917
and I obey.

16:57.917 --> 17:00.625
In council chambers,

17:00.625 --> 17:03.083
you are my<i> cha'DIch.</i>

17:03.083 --> 17:04.917
You do not insist.

17:04.917 --> 17:07.083
<i>You</i> obey.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.667
Yes, brother.

17:45.291 --> 17:47.667
(<i> speaking Klingon</i> )

17:47.667 --> 17:50.709
(<i> loud announcement</i>

17:47.667 --> 17:50.709
<i>in Klingon</i> )

18:10.166 --> 18:14.792
I am Worf, son of Mogh.

18:14.792 --> 18:17.417
I have come to challenge

18:17.417 --> 18:21.041
the lies that have been

18:17.417 --> 18:21.041
spoken of my father.

18:21.041 --> 18:24.083
(<i> excited murmuring</i> )

18:30.208 --> 18:32.959
Worf, son of Mogh,

18:32.959 --> 18:35.125
you have challenged

18:35.125 --> 18:37.625
the judgment of the Council.

18:37.625 --> 18:41.875
Are you prepared to answer

18:37.625 --> 18:41.875
for this if you fail?

18:41.875 --> 18:45.500
Yes, with my life.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.667
Why do you come before us,

18:45.500 --> 18:48.667
Commander?

18:48.667 --> 18:52.208
I am Kurn,

18:48.667 --> 18:52.208
son of... Lorgh.

18:52.208 --> 18:55.542
I will stand

18:52.208 --> 18:55.542
by Worf's side.

18:55.542 --> 18:57.291
I am<i> cha'DIch.</i>

18:57.291 --> 19:00.750
Hmm.

18:57.291 --> 19:00.750
(<i> grunts</i> )

19:05.250 --> 19:08.542
You claim a birthright

19:05.250 --> 19:08.542
you have forsaken.

19:08.542 --> 19:11.458
I have<i> not</i> forsaken

19:08.542 --> 19:11.458
my heritage.

19:12.625 --> 19:15.000
I am Klingon.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.291
My heart is of this world.

19:18.291 --> 19:21.041
My blood is as yours.

19:21.041 --> 19:25.417
Yet, you come to us

19:21.041 --> 19:25.417
wearing a child's uniform.

19:25.417 --> 19:29.583
And you bring outsiders

19:25.417 --> 19:29.583
to our Great Hall.

19:29.583 --> 19:32.083
I am here at

19:29.583 --> 19:32.083
my own request.

19:32.083 --> 19:36.083
I am Captain Jean-Luc

19:32.083 --> 19:36.083
Picard of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

19:36.083 --> 19:38.125
Your words

19:36.083 --> 19:38.125
mean nothing here.

19:38.125 --> 19:41.333
Duras, let him speak.

19:41.333 --> 19:44.083
Lieutenant Worf has

19:41.333 --> 19:44.083
served under my command

19:44.083 --> 19:46.000
with distinction.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.333
He has earned my admiration

19:46.000 --> 19:49.333
and my respect.

19:49.333 --> 19:52.458
It is my greatest wish

19:49.333 --> 19:52.458
that this Council,

19:52.458 --> 19:54.500
in its wisdom,

19:54.500 --> 19:58.083
will clear his family name

19:54.500 --> 19:58.083
and return him to duty.

19:58.083 --> 20:02.166
The trust of a commanding

19:58.083 --> 20:02.166
officer is admirable.

20:02.166 --> 20:04.583
Council has noted it.

20:04.583 --> 20:08.125
Speak the accusation.

20:08.125 --> 20:10.333
For many turns,

20:10.333 --> 20:12.375
the truth about Khitomer

20:12.375 --> 20:15.917
hath lain dormant,

20:12.375 --> 20:15.917
unknown.

20:15.917 --> 20:19.166
Now the truth

20:15.917 --> 20:19.166
has been revealed.

20:19.166 --> 20:22.792
The traitor, Mogh, sent

20:19.166 --> 20:22.792
the defense access codes

20:22.792 --> 20:24.834
to the Romulan

20:22.792 --> 20:24.834
patrol ships,

20:24.834 --> 20:28.250
allowing them to

20:24.834 --> 20:28.250
destroy the outpost.

20:28.250 --> 20:32.208
Thousands died

20:28.250 --> 20:32.208
on Khitomer.

20:32.208 --> 20:35.500
My<i> father</i> died on Khitomer.

20:37.834 --> 20:41.166
Their deaths must be avenged.

20:41.166 --> 20:44.250
(<i> crowd murmuring</i> )

20:49.250 --> 20:53.583
Your father

20:49.250 --> 20:53.583
was a traitor.

20:58.333 --> 21:01.375
By posing this challenge,

21:01.375 --> 21:03.959
<i>you</i> are a traitor.

21:16.792 --> 21:20.125
You will not wear

21:16.792 --> 21:20.125
the emblems of our people.

21:23.208 --> 21:25.875
You are a fool

21:25.875 --> 21:29.834
and your challenge can only

21:25.875 --> 21:29.834
result in a fool's death.

21:29.834 --> 21:33.125
It is a good day

21:29.834 --> 21:33.125
to die, Duras.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.625
And the day is not yet over.

21:39.125 --> 21:42.458
Council stands in recess.

21:42.458 --> 21:45.333
We will return

21:42.458 --> 21:45.333
for the<i> Mek'ba.</i>

21:45.333 --> 21:48.083
The evidence

21:45.333 --> 21:48.083
will be presented.

21:48.083 --> 21:50.333
<i>Qapla'!</i>

21:59.667 --> 22:02.625
Mr. Data...

22:02.625 --> 22:05.125
find out everything you can

22:02.625 --> 22:05.125
about the destruction

22:05.125 --> 22:06.291
of the Khitomer Outpost.

22:06.291 --> 22:08.125
Cross-reference

22:06.291 --> 22:08.125
with Romulan tactics

22:08.125 --> 22:10.041
and strategic information

22:08.125 --> 22:10.041
on the region.

22:10.041 --> 22:13.417
And request access to the

22:10.041 --> 22:13.417
Klingon central information net.

22:13.417 --> 22:17.041
Computer, presentation overview

22:13.417 --> 22:17.041
of Klingon custom and law

22:17.041 --> 22:18.834
pertaining to

22:17.041 --> 22:18.834
familial accountability.

22:18.834 --> 22:20.166
COMPUTER:

22:18.834 --> 22:20.166
Accessing.

22:20.166 --> 22:21.709
In my ready room.

22:25.917 --> 22:27.750
Worf.

22:29.291 --> 22:32.041
I would speak with you.

22:32.041 --> 22:34.250
Alone.

22:48.625 --> 22:51.667
You should not have

22:48.625 --> 22:51.667
brought the challenge.

22:51.667 --> 22:55.166
There was no risk to you.

22:55.166 --> 22:57.041
What does it matter?

22:57.041 --> 22:58.750
I am Klingon.

22:58.750 --> 23:01.208
Of that,

22:58.750 --> 23:01.208
I have no question.

23:01.208 --> 23:04.291
But your life

23:01.208 --> 23:04.291
in the Federation

23:04.291 --> 23:08.291
would not be affected

23:04.291 --> 23:08.291
by this judgment.

23:08.291 --> 23:10.291
My father...

23:10.291 --> 23:12.333
Is dead.

23:12.333 --> 23:15.417
He died long ago.

23:16.667 --> 23:20.291
I knew your father,

23:16.667 --> 23:20.291
served with him.

23:20.291 --> 23:24.166
This is not how I wanted

23:20.291 --> 23:24.166
to remember him.

23:24.166 --> 23:28.041
We must let

23:24.166 --> 23:28.041
the past be

23:28.041 --> 23:31.625
and protect

23:28.041 --> 23:31.625
what we have now.

23:31.625 --> 23:35.166
If you leave

23:31.625 --> 23:35.166
before the<i> Mek'ba,</i>

23:35.166 --> 23:38.250
no shame will

23:35.166 --> 23:38.250
come upon you.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.333
Return to your ship.

23:40.333 --> 23:42.792
Go back to your life.

23:42.792 --> 23:45.625
The challenge

23:42.792 --> 23:45.625
will be forgotten.

23:45.625 --> 23:48.667
Why would you ask me

23:45.625 --> 23:48.667
to lay aside

23:48.667 --> 23:50.959
the honor of my father,

23:50.959 --> 23:53.166
my family?

23:53.166 --> 23:55.208
Are these the words

23:53.166 --> 23:55.208
of the Council?

23:55.208 --> 24:00.250
I will not

23:55.208 --> 24:00.250
be questioned by you.

24:00.250 --> 24:02.208
Leave now,

24:02.208 --> 24:06.333
or you, too, will be

24:02.208 --> 24:06.333
condemned as a traitor.

24:12.667 --> 24:15.291
What Federation starship was

24:12.667 --> 24:15.291
the closest to the Khitomer

24:15.291 --> 24:17.166
at the time of the attack?

24:17.166 --> 24:21.625
DATA:

24:17.166 --> 24:21.625
The USS<i> Intrepid</i> was the first

24:17.166 --> 24:21.625
ship on the scene, sir.

24:21.625 --> 24:22.875
Contact Starfleet.

24:22.875 --> 24:25.291
Request all logs

24:22.875 --> 24:25.291
of the<i> Intrepid.</i>

24:25.291 --> 24:28.041
Riker to Dr. Crusher.

24:25.291 --> 24:28.041
Crusher here.

24:28.041 --> 24:30.709
I want you to look

24:28.041 --> 24:30.709
over the medical records

24:28.041 --> 24:30.709
from all the rescue vessels

24:30.709 --> 24:32.792
that responded to

24:30.709 --> 24:32.792
the Khitomer massacre.

24:32.792 --> 24:35.291
See if there's any information

24:32.792 --> 24:35.291
on the aftermath that

24:32.792 --> 24:35.291
might help us.

24:35.291 --> 24:36.917
CRUSHER:

24:35.291 --> 24:36.917
Understood.

24:41.041 --> 24:42.917
I should have known.

24:46.417 --> 24:48.417
Worf was right.

24:48.417 --> 24:51.709
It is a good day to die.

24:51.709 --> 24:54.750
The time has not yet come.

24:54.750 --> 24:58.625
It does not have

24:54.750 --> 24:58.625
to come for many turns.

24:58.625 --> 25:02.458
I know who you are, Kurn,

24:58.625 --> 25:02.458
son of Mogh.

25:02.458 --> 25:03.959
What?

25:03.959 --> 25:07.625
It was a wise choice

25:03.959 --> 25:07.625
to hide your family name.

25:07.625 --> 25:10.458
Do not err now

25:07.625 --> 25:10.458
by embracing it again,

25:10.458 --> 25:12.625
for you only embrace death.

25:12.625 --> 25:14.458
We shall see.

25:14.458 --> 25:18.583
Worf has made a choice

25:14.458 --> 25:18.583
and he will die for it,

25:18.583 --> 25:22.375
but you can still be safe.

25:22.375 --> 25:24.417
Let him stand alone.

25:24.417 --> 25:26.792
He is my brother.

25:26.792 --> 25:29.709
I will not betray him!

25:33.917 --> 25:36.458
Then you will die for him.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.875
(<i> growls</i> )

25:45.208 --> 25:47.917
(<i> growling and grunting</i> )

25:49.333 --> 25:51.750
(<i> grunts in pain</i> )

25:54.125 --> 25:56.375
(<i> speaking Klingon</i> )

26:03.834 --> 26:08.125
What kind of a weapon

26:03.834 --> 26:08.125
makes a vicious wound like that?

26:08.125 --> 26:10.041
It is a<i> kut'luch,</i>

26:10.041 --> 26:13.959
the ceremonial weapon

26:10.041 --> 26:13.959
of an assassin.

26:13.959 --> 26:17.959
Fortunately, his metabolic

26:13.959 --> 26:17.959
recovery is phenomenal.

26:17.959 --> 26:20.208
He will be all right.

26:20.208 --> 26:21.750
It does not matter.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.834
We should have let him die.

26:23.834 --> 26:27.208
Now that Duras

26:23.834 --> 26:27.208
knows his bloodlines...

26:27.208 --> 26:29.709
we will both be executed.

26:29.709 --> 26:33.208
You sound like you've

26:29.709 --> 26:33.208
already lost, Worf.

26:37.834 --> 26:40.792
Commander, I have discovered

26:37.834 --> 26:40.792
the basis of the charges

26:40.792 --> 26:42.750
against Worf's father.

26:42.750 --> 26:45.458
Apparently, the Klingons

26:42.750 --> 26:45.458
recently captured

26:45.458 --> 26:48.375
a Romulan ship with logs

26:45.458 --> 26:48.375
that provided new information

26:48.375 --> 26:50.000
on the Khitomer attack.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.750
They clearly indicate

26:50.000 --> 26:52.750
a transmission from the outpost

26:52.750 --> 26:54.125
to the Romulan ship

26:54.125 --> 26:56.250
moments before

26:54.125 --> 26:56.250
the shields went down.

26:56.250 --> 26:58.500
From Worf's father?

26:58.500 --> 27:01.458
They do correspond to

26:58.500 --> 27:01.458
Mogh's personal security code.

27:01.458 --> 27:03.959
How can we be sure those records

27:01.458 --> 27:03.959
haven't been falsified?

27:03.959 --> 27:07.041
Well, we can cross-check

27:03.959 --> 27:07.041
them against the<i> Intrepid's</i>

27:03.959 --> 27:07.041
sensor logs.

27:07.041 --> 27:08.959
I will try,

27:08.959 --> 27:11.750
but the<i> Intrepid</i> was at

27:08.959 --> 27:11.750
the edge of sensor range

27:08.959 --> 27:11.750
during the attack

27:11.750 --> 27:14.709
and we cannot be certain

27:11.750 --> 27:14.709
if the scan was complete.

27:14.709 --> 27:16.625
Looks like a pretty good

27:14.709 --> 27:16.625
match-up, Data.

27:16.625 --> 27:18.625
Both the<i> Intrepid</i>

27:16.625 --> 27:18.625
and the Romulan logs

27:18.625 --> 27:21.041
show a series of distress

27:18.625 --> 27:21.041
signals from Khitomer.

27:21.041 --> 27:22.458
What happened

27:21.041 --> 27:22.458
there?

27:22.458 --> 27:24.542
Those are gaps

27:22.458 --> 27:24.542
in the<i> Intrepid's</i> logs.

27:24.542 --> 27:26.250
Missing information

27:24.542 --> 27:26.250
due to the range.

27:26.250 --> 27:29.208
That is where Mogh's alleged

27:26.250 --> 27:29.208
transmission should be.

27:29.208 --> 27:30.625
Right in the middle of the gap?

27:30.625 --> 27:33.125
Wait a second, Data.

27:30.625 --> 27:33.125
Back up.

27:33.125 --> 27:36.208
Just before

27:33.125 --> 27:36.208
the<i> Intrepid's</i> gap begins,

27:36.208 --> 27:38.875
the timebase on both files

27:36.208 --> 27:38.875
are in perfect sync.

27:38.875 --> 27:41.083
But look.

27:41.083 --> 27:42.750
Look at what happens

27:41.083 --> 27:42.750
to the signal

27:42.750 --> 27:44.417
after the shields

27:42.750 --> 27:44.417
are dropped.

27:44.417 --> 27:46.083
They are no longer

27:44.417 --> 27:46.083
synchronous.

27:46.083 --> 27:48.583
Commander, somebody's

27:46.083 --> 27:48.583
been rewriting history.

27:50.834 --> 27:53.542
I do not pretend to fully

27:50.834 --> 27:53.542
understand the nuances

27:53.542 --> 27:55.542
of your world's law

27:53.542 --> 27:55.542
and culture, Lieutenant,

27:55.542 --> 27:59.500
but I do understand when someone

27:55.542 --> 27:59.500
is trying to hide something.

27:59.500 --> 28:02.417
K'mpec urged me

27:59.500 --> 28:02.417
to drop my challenge,

28:02.417 --> 28:06.166
abandon my family honor.

28:06.166 --> 28:10.250
It was impossible to believe

28:06.166 --> 28:10.250
I was hearing a Klingon speak.

28:10.250 --> 28:13.959
Obviously, they did not expect

28:10.250 --> 28:13.959
and never wanted this challenge.

28:13.959 --> 28:15.667
You're getting close

28:13.959 --> 28:15.667
to something, Lieutenant.

28:15.667 --> 28:19.625
Something they care

28:15.667 --> 28:19.625
a great deal about protecting.

28:19.625 --> 28:21.875
If it is true,

28:21.875 --> 28:24.000
it is not just Duras

28:24.000 --> 28:27.417
but the High Council itself

28:24.000 --> 28:27.417
that is my enemy.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.041
Captain...

28:32.041 --> 28:34.709
I must choose

28:32.041 --> 28:34.709
another<i> cha'DIch.</i>

28:34.709 --> 28:38.291
I would like your permission

28:34.709 --> 28:38.291
to ask one of the crew.

28:38.291 --> 28:40.625
Well, of course, Lieutenant.

28:38.291 --> 28:40.625
Choose whomever you wish.

28:40.625 --> 28:44.041
Then I would ask you

28:40.625 --> 28:44.041
to stand with me.

28:44.041 --> 28:47.250
You may refuse

28:44.041 --> 28:47.250
with no dishonor.

28:47.250 --> 28:49.208
Thank you, Lieutenant.

28:49.208 --> 28:52.208
I appreciate the gesture,

28:49.208 --> 28:52.208
but I know that there are

28:52.208 --> 28:54.542
stronger and younger men

28:52.208 --> 28:54.542
from whom to choose.

28:54.542 --> 28:58.959
I can think of no one

28:54.542 --> 28:58.959
I would rather have at my side.

29:03.041 --> 29:05.417
<i>jIlajneS.</i>

29:05.417 --> 29:09.291
<i>ghIj qet jaghmeyjaj.</i>

29:09.291 --> 29:11.709
I accept.

29:15.125 --> 29:17.208
(<i> announcement in Klingon</i> )

29:31.291 --> 29:33.959
My challenge will proceed.

29:33.959 --> 29:37.417
No threats, no treachery

29:33.959 --> 29:37.417
will stop it.

29:37.417 --> 29:40.834
Not even a trap set

29:37.417 --> 29:40.834
for my<i> cha'DIch</i>

29:40.834 --> 29:42.792
by a coward.

29:42.792 --> 29:45.083
Duras!

29:45.083 --> 29:49.291
I will not hear lies

29:45.083 --> 29:49.291
from the son of a traitor.

29:49.291 --> 29:52.166
Keep your place,

29:49.291 --> 29:52.166
Picard!

29:52.166 --> 29:53.792
This is my place.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.583
He is now my<i> cha'DIch.</i>

29:55.583 --> 29:57.917
This is not your world, human.

29:57.917 --> 30:00.583
You do not

29:57.917 --> 30:00.583
command here.

30:00.583 --> 30:02.333
I'm not here to command.

30:02.333 --> 30:06.208
Then you must

30:02.333 --> 30:06.208
be ready to fight.

30:06.208 --> 30:11.000
Something Starfleet

30:06.208 --> 30:11.000
does not teach you.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.333
You may test that assumption

30:11.000 --> 30:15.333
at your convenience.

30:31.542 --> 30:33.417
I've got something.

30:33.417 --> 30:36.542
Worf was not the only survivor

30:33.417 --> 30:36.542
of the Khitomer massacre.

30:36.542 --> 30:40.542
Another child?

30:36.542 --> 30:40.542
No, a Klingon woman

30:36.542 --> 30:40.542
was found<i> with</i> Worf.

30:43.709 --> 30:46.000
RIKER:

30:43.709 --> 30:46.000
Kahlest. Who was she?

30:46.000 --> 30:48.959
I don't know, but the report

30:46.000 --> 30:48.959
said she was severely injured,

30:48.959 --> 30:51.500
was transferred to

30:48.959 --> 30:51.500
Starbase 24 for treatment--

30:51.500 --> 30:53.583
that was when she was

30:51.500 --> 30:53.583
separated from Worf--

30:53.583 --> 30:56.291
and after her recovery,

30:53.583 --> 30:56.291
she returned home.

30:56.291 --> 30:58.750
We've got to find her

30:56.291 --> 30:58.750
if she's still alive.

30:58.750 --> 31:00.917
Data, scan the Klingon

30:58.750 --> 31:00.917
central net.

31:00.917 --> 31:03.458
See if there's

31:00.917 --> 31:03.458
any record of her.

31:03.458 --> 31:07.959
DURAS:

31:03.458 --> 31:07.959
The Romulans lowered the

31:03.458 --> 31:07.959
outpost's shields themselves.

31:07.959 --> 31:10.375
They were given

31:07.959 --> 31:10.375
the defense access code.

31:10.375 --> 31:13.000
The record

31:10.375 --> 31:13.000
clearly shows

31:13.000 --> 31:15.333
the Romulan patrol ship

31:15.333 --> 31:19.083
receiving a personal

31:15.333 --> 31:19.083
transmission from Mogh

31:19.083 --> 31:22.458
seconds before

31:19.083 --> 31:22.458
the shields fell.

31:22.458 --> 31:25.000
RIKER:

31:22.458 --> 31:25.000
Riker to Captain Picard.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Stand by.

31:28.917 --> 31:31.333
The Khitomer Commander

31:28.917 --> 31:31.333
noted in his log

31:31.333 --> 31:34.125
that Mogh had been

31:31.333 --> 31:34.125
acting suspiciously...

31:34.125 --> 31:37.750
Go ahead, Number One.

31:34.125 --> 31:37.750
We've located another survivor

31:34.125 --> 31:37.750
of the Khitomer massacre--

31:37.750 --> 31:39.875
a woman who was

31:37.750 --> 31:39.875
found with Worf.

31:39.875 --> 31:41.417
Her name is Kahlest.

31:41.417 --> 31:43.667
She resides in the Old Quarter

31:41.417 --> 31:43.667
of the First City.

31:43.667 --> 31:46.041
Well done. Picard out.

31:46.041 --> 31:48.500
DURAS:

31:46.041 --> 31:48.500
...Another witness testified

31:46.041 --> 31:48.500
that Mogh often spoke

31:48.500 --> 31:51.041
of his admiration

31:48.500 --> 31:51.041
for the Romulans--

31:51.041 --> 31:54.375
their culture,

31:51.041 --> 31:54.375
their women.

31:54.375 --> 31:57.333
Mogh betrayed us

31:57.333 --> 32:01.458
and 4,000 Klingons

31:57.333 --> 32:01.458
died on Khitomer.

32:01.458 --> 32:05.041
Only the son

32:01.458 --> 32:05.041
of Mogh survived.

32:05.041 --> 32:06.417
K'mpec.

32:06.417 --> 32:09.250
May we have

32:06.417 --> 32:09.250
a short recess?

32:10.291 --> 32:12.166
<i>Len'mat.</i>

32:16.917 --> 32:20.166
Have you heard of

32:16.917 --> 32:20.166
a woman called Kahlest?

32:20.166 --> 32:23.083
She was my<i> ghojmok,</i>

32:20.166 --> 32:23.083
my nurse.

32:23.083 --> 32:24.834
Then it's possible

32:23.083 --> 32:24.834
she was an eyewitness

32:24.834 --> 32:26.417
to your father's

32:24.834 --> 32:26.417
activities on Khitomer.

32:26.417 --> 32:29.000
But she died in the attack.

32:26.417 --> 32:29.000
No, she survived.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.625
She's living

32:29.000 --> 32:30.625
in the Old Quarter.

32:30.625 --> 32:32.166
I'm going to find her.

32:32.166 --> 32:33.875
It is too dangerous.

32:33.875 --> 32:35.625
You must not go alone.

32:35.625 --> 32:38.542
Hey, I'm your<i> cha'DIch.</i>

33:16.959 --> 33:18.834
Kahlest?

33:20.166 --> 33:22.917
What do you want?

33:22.917 --> 33:24.709
Your help.

33:24.709 --> 33:26.583
No.

33:26.583 --> 33:29.583
You don't even know

33:26.583 --> 33:29.583
what I want.

33:31.125 --> 33:33.917
You are<i> cha'DIch.</i>

33:33.917 --> 33:35.625
I know.

33:35.625 --> 33:37.875
Then you also know

33:37.875 --> 33:40.083
that Worf's life

33:37.875 --> 33:40.083
is at stake.

33:40.083 --> 33:42.208
I cannot help.

33:42.208 --> 33:44.417
I am dead.

33:44.417 --> 33:47.041
A long time dead.

33:47.041 --> 33:49.041
Were you with

33:47.041 --> 33:49.041
Worf's father

33:49.041 --> 33:51.041
just before the

33:49.041 --> 33:51.041
attack on Khitomer?

33:53.083 --> 33:55.208
No.

33:57.166 --> 33:59.709
My life ended on Khitomer.

33:59.709 --> 34:03.208
I served a proud family,

34:03.208 --> 34:06.333
a strong house.

34:07.458 --> 34:09.500
All that is gone.

34:09.500 --> 34:11.667
Worf is not gone.

34:11.667 --> 34:15.333
The family you served

34:11.667 --> 34:15.333
needs you again.

34:15.333 --> 34:17.792
I cannot help.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.166
Was his father

34:19.000 --> 34:22.166
a traitor?

34:22.166 --> 34:25.083
No.

34:25.083 --> 34:28.000
Mogh was loyal to the Emperor.

34:29.417 --> 34:32.834
Mogh suspected someone

34:29.417 --> 34:32.834
of plotting with the Romulans

34:32.834 --> 34:35.125
and followed them

34:32.834 --> 34:35.125
to Khitomer.

34:35.125 --> 34:37.792
Who?

34:35.125 --> 34:37.792
Who was the traitor?

34:37.792 --> 34:40.667
I do not know.

34:43.750 --> 34:46.917
Then we have no way

34:43.750 --> 34:46.917
to prove Mogh's innocence...

34:48.291 --> 34:51.959
and Worf will die

34:48.291 --> 34:51.959
as the son of a traitor.

34:54.834 --> 34:57.333
You must leave now,<i> cha'DIch.</i>

34:59.208 --> 35:01.417
I am dead.

35:12.667 --> 35:14.333
(<i> yelling in Klingon</i> )

35:38.125 --> 35:40.291
(<i> groaning</i> )

35:49.875 --> 35:51.875
My appreciation, madam.

35:51.875 --> 35:54.667
You are brave,<i> cha'DIch.</i>

35:54.667 --> 35:56.625
Worf chose well.

35:59.417 --> 36:02.709
Kahlest, would they

35:59.417 --> 36:02.709
recognize you?

36:02.709 --> 36:04.667
Would they know who you are?

36:04.667 --> 36:08.375
K'mpec would

36:04.667 --> 36:08.375
remember Kahlest.

36:08.375 --> 36:11.834
I caught his eye

36:08.375 --> 36:11.834
back then,

36:11.834 --> 36:14.542
but he was too fat.

36:16.166 --> 36:18.625
Come back with me.

36:18.625 --> 36:21.208
They won't know

36:18.625 --> 36:21.208
how much you know.

36:21.208 --> 36:24.250
It may shake loose the truth.

36:27.166 --> 36:29.875
I will come.

36:33.208 --> 36:35.083
DURAS:

36:33.208 --> 36:35.083
The evidence is clear.

36:35.083 --> 36:39.709
I would ask that

36:35.083 --> 36:39.709
the judgment stand.

36:39.709 --> 36:43.208
Let Worf be

36:39.709 --> 36:43.208
condemned as a son

36:43.208 --> 36:44.959
of a traitor

36:43.208 --> 36:44.959
to the Empire.

36:44.959 --> 36:47.291
(<i> Klingons growling</i> )

36:47.291 --> 36:51.291
Worf, son of Mogh,

36:51.291 --> 36:53.041
the judgment of...

36:53.041 --> 36:55.709
K'mpec!

36:55.709 --> 36:58.250
The<i> Mek'ba</i> is

36:55.709 --> 36:58.250
not complete.

36:58.250 --> 37:02.458
I bring an eyewitness

36:58.250 --> 37:02.458
to the Khitomer massacre.

37:02.458 --> 37:05.542
One who has

37:02.458 --> 37:05.542
new evidence, K'mpec.

37:09.417 --> 37:11.709
<i>Len'mat!</i>

37:11.709 --> 37:14.166
What is it you think

37:11.709 --> 37:14.166
you know, old woman?

37:14.166 --> 37:15.583
Do not answer.

37:15.583 --> 37:17.417
It is the rules

37:15.583 --> 37:17.417
of the<i> Mek'ba</i>

37:17.417 --> 37:20.333
that evidence be presented

37:17.417 --> 37:20.333
in open council.

37:20.333 --> 37:22.542
She will die before

37:20.333 --> 37:22.542
she gives evidence.

37:22.542 --> 37:24.917
Be silent, Duras.

37:24.917 --> 37:28.583
Would you kill an old woman

37:24.917 --> 37:28.583
to cover your dishonor?

37:30.542 --> 37:32.542
Yes.

37:32.542 --> 37:36.166
It is your dishonor

37:32.542 --> 37:36.166
we are protecting here,

37:36.166 --> 37:38.792
isn't it, Duras?

37:38.792 --> 37:41.709
I have no reluctance

37:38.792 --> 37:41.709
to kill<i> you,</i> human.

37:41.709 --> 37:45.166
Are you prepared to hear

37:41.709 --> 37:45.166
her evidence in open council?

37:45.166 --> 37:48.750
Obviously, we would not.

37:48.750 --> 37:51.041
Kahlest...

37:51.041 --> 37:53.333
you can go now.

37:57.542 --> 38:01.375
It is good

37:57.542 --> 38:01.375
to see you again.

38:02.917 --> 38:06.458
You are still fat, K'mpec.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.500
I asked you to leave.

38:15.500 --> 38:18.333
To let this challenge

38:15.500 --> 38:18.333
go unanswered.

38:18.333 --> 38:20.709
But you did not

38:18.333 --> 38:20.709
hear my words,

38:20.709 --> 38:24.834
and now it has

38:20.709 --> 38:24.834
come to this.

38:28.166 --> 38:30.792
Why did you judge

38:28.166 --> 38:30.792
my father guilty

38:30.792 --> 38:32.709
when you<i> knew</i> he was not?!

38:32.709 --> 38:35.917
Someone had to be blamed.

38:35.917 --> 38:38.792
The warriors who captured

38:35.917 --> 38:38.792
the Romulan ship

38:38.792 --> 38:41.041
had learned of the treachery.

38:41.041 --> 38:43.667
But only the Council knew

38:43.667 --> 38:46.667
whose security code

38:43.667 --> 38:46.667
had been transmitted.

38:46.667 --> 38:50.208
Ja'rod...

38:50.208 --> 38:53.542
father... of Duras.

38:53.542 --> 38:57.125
This<i> Ha'DIBah</i> should have

38:53.542 --> 38:57.125
been fed to the dogs!

38:57.125 --> 39:01.000
His family is powerful.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.291
If the truth were known,

39:01.000 --> 39:04.291
it would shatter the Council.

39:04.291 --> 39:08.750
Most certainly plunge

39:04.291 --> 39:08.750
us into civil war.

39:08.750 --> 39:10.417
You were in Starfleet.

39:10.417 --> 39:14.000
We did not expect<i> you</i>

39:10.417 --> 39:14.000
to challenge the judgment.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.166
Nor did we know

39:14.000 --> 39:17.166
there was another son of Mogh.

39:21.542 --> 39:24.417
Worf's challenge

39:21.542 --> 39:24.417
is successful.

39:24.417 --> 39:27.542
The honor of his family

39:24.417 --> 39:27.542
must be restored.

39:27.542 --> 39:32.291
You do not understand.

39:32.291 --> 39:35.709
His challenge was defeated

39:35.709 --> 39:38.291
before he ever made it.

39:38.291 --> 39:41.333
You will not be allowed

39:38.291 --> 39:41.333
to present this evidence.

39:41.333 --> 39:43.500
The judgment stands.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.291
You will be condemned.

39:45.291 --> 39:47.000
So will your brother.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.625
There is no other way now.

39:49.625 --> 39:52.667
You admit the truth

39:52.667 --> 39:56.417
and yet expect him

39:52.667 --> 39:56.417
to accept punishment?

39:56.417 --> 40:00.375
What does this say

39:56.417 --> 40:00.375
of an Empire

40:00.375 --> 40:02.959
who holds honor so dear?

40:02.959 --> 40:07.125
The Empire will not

40:02.959 --> 40:07.125
be destroyed

40:07.125 --> 40:10.667
for one family's honor.

40:10.667 --> 40:12.792
Unacceptable, K'mpec.

40:12.792 --> 40:14.709
You have no say

40:12.792 --> 40:14.709
in this,<i> cha'DIch.</i>

40:14.709 --> 40:17.333
I speak now as the Captain

40:14.709 --> 40:17.333
of the USS<i> Enterprise</i>

40:17.333 --> 40:19.125
and Lieutenant Worf's

40:17.333 --> 40:19.125
commanding officer.

40:19.125 --> 40:23.041
You will not execute

40:19.125 --> 40:23.041
a member of my crew,

40:23.041 --> 40:25.250
nor will I turn his brother

40:23.041 --> 40:25.250
over to you.

40:25.250 --> 40:28.208
This is not

40:25.250 --> 40:28.208
the Federation, Picard.

40:28.208 --> 40:29.834
If you defy

40:29.834 --> 40:32.709
an order of

40:29.834 --> 40:32.709
the High Council,

40:32.709 --> 40:35.792
the alliance

40:32.709 --> 40:35.792
with the Federation

40:35.792 --> 40:38.041
could fall to dust.

40:38.041 --> 40:40.125
The alliance of the Federation

40:40.125 --> 40:43.542
is not based on lies, K'mpec.

40:43.542 --> 40:47.000
Protect your secrets

40:43.542 --> 40:47.000
if you must,

40:47.000 --> 40:50.583
but you will not

40:47.000 --> 40:50.583
sacrifice these men.

40:52.583 --> 40:55.542
I will die

40:52.583 --> 40:55.542
for the Empire.

40:55.542 --> 40:56.959
Lieutenant...

40:56.959 --> 41:00.000
The<i> cha'DIch</i>

40:56.959 --> 41:00.000
will be silent!

41:03.792 --> 41:07.208
Allow my brother

41:03.792 --> 41:07.208
to return to his life.

41:07.208 --> 41:10.542
Only you need know

41:07.208 --> 41:10.542
his true bloodline.

41:10.542 --> 41:12.375
Not acceptable.

41:12.375 --> 41:14.375
His honor would

41:12.375 --> 41:14.375
demand revenge.

41:18.792 --> 41:22.208
If you allow him to live,

41:22.208 --> 41:24.250
I will give you something

41:24.250 --> 41:27.667
that will serve your purpose

41:24.250 --> 41:27.667
far more than my death.

41:30.709 --> 41:34.166
I will accept

41:30.709 --> 41:34.166
discommendation.

41:34.166 --> 41:36.083
Ah...

41:40.375 --> 41:42.583
You...

41:42.583 --> 41:45.875
would do this

41:42.583 --> 41:45.875
in open council?

41:47.792 --> 41:49.542
It would be the same

41:49.542 --> 41:52.500
as admitting

41:49.542 --> 41:52.500
your father's guilt, Worf.

41:52.500 --> 41:54.709
So be it.

41:55.667 --> 42:00.542
Your heart is Klingon.

42:00.542 --> 42:02.583
It will be done.

42:05.041 --> 42:07.375
What has been said here

42:07.375 --> 42:11.375
will never be

42:07.375 --> 42:11.375
spoken of again.

42:15.291 --> 42:18.583
<i>You</i> are the son of a traitor.

42:27.750 --> 42:30.333
Now I am ready.

42:37.834 --> 42:40.458
Why is he doing this?

42:40.458 --> 42:43.000
I was prepared to die.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.792
Worf wants you to live.

42:45.792 --> 42:49.333
The name of your father

42:45.792 --> 42:49.333
must someday be cleared.

42:49.333 --> 42:53.083
He needs you alive

42:49.333 --> 42:53.083
with your honor intact.

42:53.083 --> 42:54.875
But to do this...

42:54.875 --> 42:57.333
There will be

42:54.875 --> 42:57.333
another day, Commander.

42:59.667 --> 43:03.625
Do not forget what

42:59.667 --> 43:03.625
he does here today.

43:05.458 --> 43:09.041
Do not let your

43:05.458 --> 43:09.041
children forget.

43:16.875 --> 43:19.917
(<i> crowd murmuring</i> )

43:29.333 --> 43:33.333
<i>tlhIH ghIj...</i>

43:33.333 --> 43:36.458
<i>jIHyoj.</i>

43:36.458 --> 43:40.291
<i>biHnuch.</i>

43:53.875 --> 43:56.500
You must also...

43:58.834 --> 44:00.834
brother.
