(bright music)

01:32.968 --> 01:33.970
- [Boy] Woo.

01:36.472 --> 01:38.975
- Jerks, what is your problem?

01:38.975 --> 01:41.518
(bright music)

01:41.518 --> 01:42.478
- [Colton] I'm in the lead.

01:42.478 --> 01:43.980
- [Riley] No, you're not.

01:43.980 --> 01:44.938
- [Colton] Get away from me.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.607
- Idiots, you're
gonna kill yourselves.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.110
(bright music)

01:53.782 --> 01:54.782
Move.

01:54.782 --> 01:55.575
Move.

(bright music)

02:21.935 --> 02:24.437
(soft music)

02:27.648 --> 02:29.067
(bike whirring)

02:29.067 --> 02:32.445
- [Riley] Hey loser,
get your butt in gear.

02:32.445 --> 02:34.238
- Yeah come on, loser.

03:04.060 --> 03:04.935
- Hi, Mom.

03:06.062 --> 03:07.230
Are you home yet?

03:09.065 --> 03:12.027
Could you run by the north
pasture and pick me up?

03:12.027 --> 03:14.028
I've run into a
bit of a problem.

03:14.028 --> 03:16.822
(bright music)

03:16.822 --> 03:18.575
- [Mary] The pin shared off?

03:18.575 --> 03:19.700
What did you hit?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.118
- I have no clue.

03:21.118 --> 03:24.080
We'll have to dig it out
before we can plow again.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.373
- It didn't throw you?

03:25.373 --> 03:27.875
You look like you've
been swimming in dirt.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.628
- No, that was a separate thing.

03:30.628 --> 03:32.588
We've got a couple of boneheads

03:32.588 --> 03:34.590
on four wheelers
tearing up the top soil.

03:34.590 --> 03:35.883
- You know any of them?

03:35.883 --> 03:37.218
- Yeah, two of them.

03:37.218 --> 03:39.220
They're on the high
school basketball team.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.513
Riley Michaels and
his brother Colton.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.975
Riley's the jerk who
kept throwing dirt on me.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.352
- Anyone get hurt?

03:46.352 --> 03:47.603
- Well almost.

03:47.603 --> 03:48.395
They.

03:50.523 --> 03:52.108
No.

03:52.108 --> 03:54.360
There was another guy with him,
but I don't know who he was.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.112
- Don't worry, I'll find out.

03:56.112 --> 03:58.488
The world's not their
personal quad track.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.992
(bright music)

04:07.082 --> 04:08.625
- How are you, Mrs. Cather?

04:08.625 --> 04:10.918
- Just fine, thank
you, Mr. Sanders.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.337
- I have a new
offer on your farm.

04:12.337 --> 04:14.713
Don't you want me to
bring it over post haste?

04:14.713 --> 04:17.258
- Sorry, but we just
bought toilet paper.

04:17.258 --> 04:18.050
- Rachel.

04:19.135 --> 04:21.012
Excuse us.

04:21.012 --> 04:22.597
- Of course, if this
isn't a good time.

04:22.597 --> 04:24.765
- As good a time as any.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.267
Rachel, go call your granddad.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.935
He's probably out by the creek.

04:32.357 --> 04:33.565
- No.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.067
Absolutely not.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.360
- Brent, take it easy.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.028
- No, I'm not gonna
take it at all.

04:39.030 --> 04:41.115
I had no use for your offer then

04:41.115 --> 04:43.450
and I have even
less use for it now.

04:44.660 --> 04:46.078
- I'm only trying to
give you some options.

04:46.078 --> 04:48.247
- No, you're trying
to limit them.

04:48.247 --> 04:49.623
Harvests are down.

04:49.623 --> 04:53.002
Land taxes are up thanks to
all these McMansions going in.

04:53.002 --> 04:55.713
What do you think that's
gonna do to our options?

04:55.713 --> 04:59.842
- Yes, taxes are up, but
so are property values.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.968
With all your real estate,
this could be a windfall.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.472
- Only if you intend to get out.

05:04.472 --> 05:05.807
I'm a farmer.

05:05.807 --> 05:07.683
It's what I've been
doing my whole life

05:07.683 --> 05:10.227
and it's what I
intend to keep doing.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.895
The rate you're
going, that's gonna be

05:11.895 --> 05:14.232
impossible in a few years.

05:14.232 --> 05:16.108
- Times change, Mr. Cather.

05:16.108 --> 05:19.570
Mining was once king here
'til the mines played out.

05:19.570 --> 05:20.863
Change is coming.

05:20.863 --> 05:22.323
You'd be wise to
stay ahead of it.

05:22.323 --> 05:23.657
- Are you finished?

05:23.657 --> 05:25.868
- Well I don't know
what else I can say.

05:25.868 --> 05:27.120
- Don't call us.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.287
We'll call you.

05:40.717 --> 05:42.677
- You're a class act,
Brent, you know that?

05:42.677 --> 05:44.012
A real class act.

05:44.012 --> 05:46.305
- You want a class
act, just watch him.

05:46.305 --> 05:49.100
That's a smile you couldn't
unclench with a crowbar.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.393
- It's a fair offer.

05:50.393 --> 05:51.852
He's not trying to con anyone.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.063
- Oh, he's good at
making it look that way.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.025
- What about Rachel?

05:58.025 --> 05:59.277
- [Brent] What about her?

05:59.277 --> 06:00.653
- [Mary] She's got
other plans, you know.

06:00.653 --> 06:01.945
- [Brent] Well, that's fine.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.405
- It's gonna be college
in a couple of years.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.073
- Well, that's why
we've been saving.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.450
- Tuitions are up.

06:06.450 --> 06:07.952
- She's a smart girl.

06:07.952 --> 06:09.203
She can get scholarships.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.455
- That's counting on a lot.

06:10.455 --> 06:11.997
- What, you don't
think she can get 'em?

06:11.997 --> 06:16.085
- I know she can but
still look at his offer.

06:16.085 --> 06:17.337
Just look at it.

06:17.337 --> 06:19.005
It would take care
of everything.

06:21.132 --> 06:23.008
- We don't need his money.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.260
I don't want his money.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.097
I've been getting a little color

06:28.097 --> 06:29.223
out of the north
fork of the creek.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.600
- [Mary] Oh, here we go.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.310
- [Brent] Well, it's the same
strike I made when I was 15.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.772
- Panning for gold
is fine as a hobby,

06:35.772 --> 06:37.523
but I'm not gonna balance
the checkbook with it.

06:37.523 --> 06:40.192
I'm not gonna be able to
pay any tuition with it.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.403
I can't do a lot of
things with dreams.

06:42.403 --> 06:43.320
- [Brent] It's like I don't
do a damn thing around here.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.947
- [Mary] Oh, that isn't fair.

06:44.947 --> 06:46.198
I know you.

06:46.198 --> 06:48.242
You think I don't do
anything around here either?

06:48.242 --> 06:49.285
What are you talking about?

06:49.285 --> 06:50.578
- [Brent] Do you think
that I don't care about

06:50.578 --> 06:51.412
whether she goes to
go to college or not?

06:51.412 --> 06:52.747
- [Mary] Yes, yes, yes.

06:52.747 --> 06:54.790
The way you're acting, I
do think you don't care.

06:54.790 --> 06:56.125
I don't think you care about me.

06:56.125 --> 06:56.917
I don't think you
care about this place.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.252
- [Brent] How dare.

06:58.252 --> 06:59.253
How can you say that I don't
care when I'm out there.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.212
- [Mary] It's easy.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.720
- Nothing you need
to worry about.

07:09.180 --> 07:10.305
Come on.

07:10.305 --> 07:11.598
We gotta go fix that plow.

07:13.225 --> 07:15.978
(gentle music)

07:17.855 --> 07:22.610
So, it was down to me and a
shovel knee deep in the mud.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.863
Got two feet from the
bank, I hit a rock.

07:25.863 --> 07:26.905
Wouldn't budge.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.200
I went and got the pry bar.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.328
Still wouldn't budge.

07:32.328 --> 07:33.620
So I took a piece of pipe.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.748
I put it over the
end of that pry bar

07:35.748 --> 07:38.667
and I just heaved
for all I was worth.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.002
Bang.

07:40.002 --> 07:43.882
Up pops this beautiful
gleaming gold nugget.

07:43.882 --> 07:46.258
23 pounds on the bathroom scale.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.677
- Pure gold?

07:47.677 --> 07:49.137
- Hell no.

07:49.137 --> 07:50.680
Not exactly.

07:50.680 --> 07:51.972
A lump of aggregate.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.267
Mostly gravel but it
was all veined through

07:54.267 --> 07:55.643
with the good stuff.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.353
I got 11 ounces out of it.

07:58.353 --> 07:59.813
Your great grandpa.

08:00.940 --> 08:03.567
He sat on that
porch with a shotgun

08:03.567 --> 08:05.903
for over two weeks
trying to keep people

08:05.903 --> 08:07.780
from stealing it
out of his creek.

08:11.367 --> 08:12.368
Oh, you got it.

08:13.202 --> 08:15.495
(soft music)

08:17.332 --> 08:18.332
- What is it?

08:23.795 --> 08:24.588
Train tracks?

08:24.588 --> 08:26.090
- Mining trains.

08:26.090 --> 08:27.925
This valley used to be
crisscrossed with them.

08:27.925 --> 08:30.052
- But I thought all the
mines were in the mountains.

08:30.052 --> 08:33.973
- Oh, they were, but these
tracks ran all the way up there.

08:33.973 --> 08:35.390
Brought the gold down here.

08:39.478 --> 08:40.688
(metal thudding)

08:40.688 --> 08:42.398
Boy, that's in there good.

08:42.398 --> 08:45.108
We'll have to get a torch down
here to get that plow out.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.652
I'll take the tractor back.

08:46.652 --> 08:48.653
You go ahead and take
the rover back up.

08:52.617 --> 08:53.408
- Grandpa.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.287
Grandpa, wait.

08:56.287 --> 08:57.663
Wait just a second.

08:57.663 --> 08:58.998
About college.

08:58.998 --> 09:00.498
I've been thinking
it'll be all right

09:00.498 --> 09:01.875
if we put it off
for a year or two.

09:01.875 --> 09:02.835
- No.

09:02.835 --> 09:04.628
- I mean, it'll still be there

09:04.628 --> 09:07.172
and there's not many jobs out
there for a history degree.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.133
- Don't talk like that.

09:09.133 --> 09:10.593
Don't even consider it.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.345
- But if we can't afford it.

09:12.345 --> 09:14.055
- That's not your worry.

09:14.055 --> 09:16.140
We'll get you through somehow.

09:16.140 --> 09:17.140
- How?

09:17.140 --> 09:18.058
Another strike?

09:20.687 --> 09:23.313
- There's still
treasure in those hills.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.357
Stuff like the
Cascadia treasure.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.402
Just waiting to be found.

09:27.402 --> 09:30.153
It just takes someone with
a vision to see where it is

09:30.153 --> 09:32.865
and nerve to go after it.

09:32.865 --> 09:34.492
- Cascadia treasure?

09:34.492 --> 09:38.578
- Yeah, treasure lost in an
abandoned mine somewhere.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.997
You ever read about it?

09:39.997 --> 09:41.415
- It sounds familiar.

09:41.415 --> 09:44.502
- You won't get the full
story from your history books.

09:44.502 --> 09:45.712
It's not history.

09:45.712 --> 09:49.798
It's just stories
still whispered about.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.675
No one ever told you?

09:54.470 --> 09:56.597
I'll tell you tonight.

09:56.597 --> 10:00.350
Now you go on home and forget
about putting college off.

10:01.185 --> 10:03.228
Oh and leave me that jack.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.522
I'm gonna need it to
lift that plow out.

10:06.523 --> 10:09.318
(tractor humming)

10:17.327 --> 10:19.578
(soft music)

11:11.172 --> 11:13.257
- Hey, where are you taking me?

11:13.257 --> 11:14.675
Where do these tracks go?

11:14.675 --> 11:17.177
(soft music)

11:26.312 --> 11:27.187
- [Fairly] Ow.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.022
Crap.

11:28.022 --> 11:30.565
(soft music)

11:48.667 --> 11:50.335
Ah, why won't it fit?

11:51.628 --> 11:53.672
- Because you're trying
to thread a metric bolt

11:53.672 --> 11:54.923
into a standard nut.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.300
- Really?

11:56.300 --> 11:57.050
But I thought.

11:59.553 --> 12:00.303
Oh.

12:01.472 --> 12:02.473
- Need a ride?

12:03.890 --> 12:04.642
- Yeah.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.188
- All right, which
McMansion is it you live in?

12:10.188 --> 12:10.940
- Right up here.

12:13.692 --> 12:16.695
Look, I'm sorry
about my friends.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.613
They can be real jerks
sometimes, you know.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.700
I'm sorry if they bugged you.

12:21.700 --> 12:24.537
It's just they were
only having fun.

12:24.537 --> 12:26.038
I didn't really wanna join them.

12:26.038 --> 12:27.247
It's just.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.167
- You're smarter
than those guys.

12:29.167 --> 12:30.375
- Thanks.

12:30.375 --> 12:31.710
- I can tell.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.212
Why do you put up with them?

12:33.212 --> 12:34.130
- Well, I just moved here.

12:34.130 --> 12:35.338
I don't know anyone else.

12:35.338 --> 12:36.257
- Rachel Cather.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.342
- Fairly.

12:38.342 --> 12:39.718
- Seriously?

12:39.718 --> 12:42.428
- Yes and I didn't pick it, so
you can just leave it alone.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.097
- Well, who did pick it?

12:44.097 --> 12:45.390
- My mom always says my dad.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.017
My dad always says my mom.

12:47.017 --> 12:48.768
(bright music)

12:48.768 --> 12:49.645
- Hey, hey.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.607
- Hey, guys.

12:52.607 --> 12:53.648
- Heads up.

12:58.195 --> 12:59.070
- [Fairly] Here, here.

12:59.070 --> 12:59.863
I live here.

13:13.085 --> 13:14.420
- You okay?

13:14.420 --> 13:15.753
- Yeah, nothing serious.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.548
Just help me get
this out of the car.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.015
- Loser gets noogie.

13:26.015 --> 13:27.432
Loser gets noogie.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.225
- Off.

13:29.602 --> 13:30.643
Watch it, dude.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.562
Get off.

13:31.562 --> 13:32.605
- Where were you, Farley?

13:32.605 --> 13:34.690
Really need to work
on your catching, bro.

13:35.690 --> 13:36.692
Gotta be careful there.

13:36.692 --> 13:37.818
Don't wanna get hurt.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.695
- [Fairly] Yeah,
yeah, just let up.

13:43.407 --> 13:44.700
- Gotta be careful there.

13:47.493 --> 13:48.745
- [Sanders] Having fun kids?

13:50.497 --> 13:52.123
- Hey Coach, it's cool.

13:52.123 --> 13:52.917
No worries here.

13:56.128 --> 13:57.713
- Give me five laps
around the block.

13:57.713 --> 13:58.713
Do it.

13:58.713 --> 13:59.715
- But we were only--

13:59.715 --> 14:00.507
- You too.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.300
Go.
- But.

14:01.300 --> 14:02.092
Ow.

14:05.553 --> 14:06.597
- Everything okay, Fairly?

14:06.597 --> 14:08.598
- Yeah Dad, everything's fine.

14:10.392 --> 14:11.685
- Thanks for your help.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.145
I was wondering
what he got into.

14:14.313 --> 14:16.773
- Dad, could you get
the garage door, please?

14:19.443 --> 14:20.818
Rachel.

14:20.818 --> 14:21.862
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.

14:26.783 --> 14:27.910
What the heck is the matter?

14:27.910 --> 14:29.077
- Californicators.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.287
- What?

14:30.287 --> 14:32.497
- You and your dad.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.583
You come here from
the city or wherever

14:34.583 --> 14:36.377
so you can get away
from the rat race

14:36.377 --> 14:39.338
and go back to the land and
then you build all over it,

14:39.338 --> 14:41.173
so that it looks like
what you just came from.

14:41.173 --> 14:41.965
- Wait, wait, wait.

14:41.965 --> 14:43.592
I'm from Sacramento.

14:43.592 --> 14:45.343
- Why don't you just go back
there and leave us out of it?

14:45.343 --> 14:47.512
- I'm from Sacramento
and I hated it.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.098
Look, you're right.

14:50.098 --> 14:51.433
I grew up in a suburb like
this, but I didn't like it

14:51.433 --> 14:53.727
because there wasn't
anything to explore.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.395
I came up here after
my parents split up

14:55.395 --> 14:57.732
because I wanted
to see open space.

14:57.732 --> 14:58.940
Mountains and stuff.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.608
I don't wanna mess with it.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.653
I just wanna see it, but I
don't know where to start.

15:03.903 --> 15:04.697
Here.

15:10.577 --> 15:14.290
My cellphone number just in
case you wanna do something.

15:14.290 --> 15:16.875
Hike a trail or
something like that.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.002
I like that stuff, really.

15:19.420 --> 15:20.212
See you later?

15:21.463 --> 15:24.048
(truck humming)

15:30.930 --> 15:32.390
- You better get changed.

15:32.390 --> 15:33.975
We got company
coming for dinner.

15:33.975 --> 15:36.687
(bright music)

15:44.903 --> 15:47.572
- You should've seen
what she found out there.

15:47.572 --> 15:50.950
A complete set of train tracks
buried just under the dirt.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.372
I'd bet they go on for
miles in each direction.

15:54.372 --> 15:56.540
- So, what about the plow?

15:56.540 --> 15:58.292
- Oh, I got that out.

15:58.292 --> 16:00.502
No damage except for the pin.

16:00.502 --> 16:01.837
The other problem
is we won't be able

16:01.837 --> 16:04.757
to plow a field until
we get that track out.

16:04.757 --> 16:06.925
- Digging it up, cutting
it up, trucking it out.

16:06.925 --> 16:08.052
That's gonna cost something.

16:08.052 --> 16:09.845
- Oh, but you haven't heard.

16:09.845 --> 16:11.555
Scrap metal's gone up.

16:11.555 --> 16:13.098
- Could be a windfall.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.433
(soft music)

16:15.433 --> 16:16.643
- Why not?

16:16.643 --> 16:18.687
There's still treasure
in those hills.

16:18.687 --> 16:19.605
- That's right.

16:19.605 --> 16:21.857
I said I'd tell you, didn't I?

16:21.857 --> 16:22.733
- Tell her what?

16:22.733 --> 16:24.777
- The Cascadia treasure.

16:24.777 --> 16:25.985
She's never heard of it.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.905
- Oh, not this one.

16:27.905 --> 16:30.907
- Oh well, I'm sorry,
but I promised.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.492
- Then give me those dishes.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.330
I'm going inside
before you turn morbid.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.375
- No taste for the dramatic.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.670
You've never been
to the mountains

16:43.670 --> 16:45.755
to the east of here, have you?

16:45.755 --> 16:47.257
No, probably not.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.593
Well the hiking trails
are to the south.

16:49.593 --> 16:50.843
There's no campgrounds.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.553
There's no nothing.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.932
But if you go, you
will have a guide.

16:56.225 --> 16:57.017
- All right, who?

16:58.602 --> 17:00.770
- A young boy about
seven, eight years old.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.480
(gentle music)

17:02.480 --> 17:04.273
Yeah, that got ya.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.067
A young boy.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.693
A young miner.

17:06.693 --> 17:10.155
About 100 years ago, his
father got the gold fever,

17:10.155 --> 17:12.825
so he went to work for the
Cascadian mining company.

17:13.658 --> 17:16.370
Biggest strike on the crest.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.875
He sifted through the
piles of gold everyday.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.002
It finally went to his head.

17:24.002 --> 17:26.588
He had to have some
of it for himself.

17:27.840 --> 17:30.883
He hoarded it in an
old abandoned tunnel.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.260
A handful everyday.

17:32.260 --> 17:35.472
He just figured he'd
come back for it later.

17:35.472 --> 17:37.975
(gentle music)

17:47.818 --> 17:50.820
(suspenseful music)

18:01.038 --> 18:02.540
His son was trapped.

18:02.540 --> 18:06.295
But what could he do
without losing everything?

18:06.295 --> 18:09.297
(suspenseful music)

18:15.428 --> 18:18.432
He came back after
the shift was gone

18:18.432 --> 18:21.768
and he worked all night
driving the block alone.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.772
(suspenseful music)

18:31.320 --> 18:33.530
He sealed the
tunnel up as a grave

18:33.530 --> 18:35.365
and fled into the mountains.

18:35.365 --> 18:38.077
For days people
could hear his wails

18:38.077 --> 18:42.205
echoing between the peaks
like something was after him.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.462
Whatever it was,
it finally got him.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.798
The gold he stole remains
lost to the mountains

18:51.798 --> 18:56.762
from whence it came and his
son still wanders those ridges.

18:58.097 --> 18:59.890
Hundreds went after
that treasure.

18:59.890 --> 19:02.017
Most of them died.

19:02.017 --> 19:04.060
Only a few ever laid eyes on it.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.897
They were heard running
mad through the mountains

19:06.897 --> 19:10.108
before they vanished forever.

19:10.108 --> 19:15.030
(thunder rumbling)
(gentle music)

19:19.075 --> 19:20.160
- Now that you've had your fun,

19:20.160 --> 19:22.328
you can go inside and
finish the dishes.

19:23.913 --> 19:24.998
- Goodnight, ladies.

19:26.417 --> 19:27.208
- Goodnight.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.345
Look at those hills.

19:40.805 --> 19:43.600
Some nights I can almost believe
the malarkey he tells you.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.477
- You think he's making it up?

19:45.477 --> 19:46.770
- Oh not that one.

19:48.105 --> 19:51.107
Sure, he embellishes, but
some version of that story

19:51.107 --> 19:53.318
has been going around
the valley for years.

19:53.318 --> 19:55.195
- Think maybe it's for real?

19:55.195 --> 19:57.613
- If it were for real,
your grandpa would've found

19:57.613 --> 19:59.950
that treasure by now,
ghost or no ghost.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.037
And we could tell
Sanders where to put it.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.997
- I thought you wanted to leave.

20:05.997 --> 20:07.665
- I love this place.

20:07.665 --> 20:09.960
Thought it had a future once.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.295
Still does, but not the
one I'm interested in.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.340
You go your own way.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.300
Don't worry about us.

We can't do this.

20:27.602 --> 20:28.603
- [Businessman] It's
too much too soon.

20:28.603 --> 20:30.147
- It's the final piece.

20:30.147 --> 20:31.188
- [Businessman] The whole region

20:31.188 --> 20:32.815
is glutted with
new subdivisions.

20:32.815 --> 20:35.735
It'll take years for schools
and utilities to catch up.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.030
The county will be down on
us like a ton of bricks.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.238
- [Sanders] The
county won't matter

20:39.238 --> 20:41.617
once we've incorporated
as a new city.

20:41.617 --> 20:42.993
- [Businessman] That's great, G,

20:42.993 --> 20:44.953
but there's no money
to do this with.

20:44.953 --> 20:45.995
You've out strengthened the men.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.413
No investor will go for it.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.792
- [Sanders] It's the
culmination of the entire plan.

20:49.792 --> 20:51.167
- [Businessman]
It's a money pit.

20:51.167 --> 20:52.752

Who is this?

Oh, yeah.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.015
There.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.058
I see it.

21:48.058 --> 21:50.727
- [Rachel] Wanna come
on a treasure hunt?

21:50.727 --> 21:52.187
- Treasure hunt?

21:52.187 --> 21:54.022
- [Rachel] Millions
of dollars in gold

21:54.022 --> 21:57.525
lost in the mountains
100 years ago

21:57.525 --> 22:01.070
through cliffs, gorges, rivers.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.113

22:02.113 --> 22:04.157
- You're so kidding me.

22:04.157 --> 22:07.077
- And if we make it
through all that,

22:07.077 --> 22:10.038
there's a vengeful
ghost standing guard.

22:10.038 --> 22:11.415
What do you say?

22:11.415 --> 22:12.832
- Tell me when.

22:12.832 --> 22:13.958
- In the morning.

22:13.958 --> 22:14.793
Six o'clock.

22:15.918 --> 22:17.420
I'll pick you up.

22:17.420 --> 22:19.798
You wanna know something?

22:19.798 --> 22:21.048
- What?

23:15.187 --> 23:16.145
Let's here.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.790
- [Rachel] What did
you put in there?

23:34.790 --> 23:36.207
- Be prepared, you know.

23:36.207 --> 23:39.002
You got a raincoat, rubber
boots, freeze dried foods,

23:39.002 --> 23:41.420
rock climbing
stuff, crystal logs.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.047
- What do you think we're doing?

23:43.047 --> 23:45.550
We're going on a hike,
not scaling Mount Everest.

23:47.385 --> 23:48.762
What's with the earbud?

23:48.762 --> 23:52.307
- It's just a way to catch
some tunes and look at this.

23:52.307 --> 23:54.893
If we get lost, way better
than a map and compass.

23:54.893 --> 23:56.185
All we gotta do,
find a clearing.

23:56.185 --> 23:58.188
Get a fix of at least
three satellites.

23:58.188 --> 23:59.940
- You won't need that.

23:59.940 --> 24:01.023
We'll have a guide.

24:01.023 --> 24:01.983
- We will?

24:01.983 --> 24:02.775
Who?

24:02.775 --> 24:04.402
- Do you hear something?

24:04.402 --> 24:09.407

(bikes whirring)

24:19.458 --> 24:20.252
Looking for someone?

24:20.252 --> 24:21.293
- [Riley] Geez.

24:22.545 --> 24:25.048
- Fairly, talk to your posse.

24:25.048 --> 24:27.550
- Guys, it's not like
I invited you along.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.135
- You told them?

24:29.135 --> 24:32.305
- Ah Farley, now you're
never gonna close the deal.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.557
- Okay, Miss Rachel.

24:33.557 --> 24:36.225
Maybe we better lay out
the game plan for you.

24:36.225 --> 24:37.810
The treasure's ours.

24:37.810 --> 24:38.603
Ours.

24:38.603 --> 24:39.395
No breaks.

24:39.395 --> 24:40.438
No contest.

24:40.438 --> 24:41.230
No rules.

24:41.230 --> 24:42.148
Ours.

24:42.148 --> 24:42.898
Wanna know why?

24:42.898 --> 24:45.360
Because we've got these.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.280
Electric start,
liquid-cooled 450 CC engines

24:48.280 --> 24:52.533
with double-wishbone suspension,
22 by 10-9 knobby radials.

24:52.533 --> 24:53.660
Dual-caliber hydraulics.

24:53.660 --> 24:54.452
Two all wheels.

24:54.452 --> 24:55.370
We rock.

24:55.370 --> 24:56.412
- Yeah.

24:57.705 --> 25:00.792
- You, on the other hand,
have the crap heap express.

25:00.792 --> 25:02.335
Guaranteed to leave
a trail of parts

25:02.335 --> 25:05.255
for the next five miles
before it goes crank case up.

25:05.255 --> 25:06.297
What does this mean?

25:06.297 --> 25:08.508
It means we can go
to places you can't.

25:08.508 --> 25:10.468
It means we can
get to them faster.

25:10.468 --> 25:11.845
It means you're toast.

25:11.845 --> 25:12.637
- You're beat.

25:12.637 --> 25:13.555
- You're done.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.390
- You're bastinadoed, darling.

25:15.390 --> 25:18.268
- Do you have any idea
where we're going?

25:18.268 --> 25:21.605
- Oh, I know exactly
where you're going.

25:21.605 --> 25:23.022
I could draw it on a map.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.108
I could point to it right now.

25:25.108 --> 25:28.695
The only question is, do
you want a cut or not?

25:28.695 --> 25:29.947
What do you say?

25:29.947 --> 25:31.405
Ditch the dork
and join the team.

25:31.405 --> 25:32.865
It's your only chance.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.993
(bright music)

25:34.993 --> 25:36.535
- Go back to the field
and spread your manure

25:36.535 --> 25:37.953
where it'll do some good.

25:39.915 --> 25:41.123
- Follow our tracks.

25:41.123 --> 25:42.208
Come on.

25:42.208 --> 25:47.213
(bright music)
(bikes whirring)

25:51.133 --> 25:51.885
- You're cool.

25:51.885 --> 25:53.303
You're totally cool.

25:53.303 --> 25:55.097
- Why'd you have to open
your big mouth to them?

25:55.097 --> 25:58.098
- I thought we were
tight, you know.

25:58.098 --> 26:00.352
Besides, he's gotta be bluffing.

26:00.352 --> 26:03.228
You didn't tell me where we
were going so he can't know.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.313
- They've been here a few years.

26:04.313 --> 26:05.815
They've probably got
something to go on

26:05.815 --> 26:08.233
and we can't catch up
with them on a road

26:08.233 --> 26:09.443
that goes around the hill.

26:09.443 --> 26:10.612
- So what do we do?

26:13.823 --> 26:17.243
- Get in, sit down, and hang on.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.705
(bright music)

26:27.962 --> 26:28.755
- Follow the trail.

26:28.755 --> 26:29.547
Follow it.

26:29.547 --> 26:30.340
Follow.

26:30.340 --> 26:31.382
- On it.

26:31.382 --> 26:34.510
On it.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.555
(horn beeping)

26:37.555 --> 26:38.848
- Woohoo, yeah.

26:40.267 --> 26:41.350
Suckers.

26:41.350 --> 26:42.768
Suckers.

26:42.768 --> 26:43.812
Woo.

26:43.812 --> 26:46.857
(bright music)

26:46.857 --> 26:47.940
They're catching up.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.233
They're catching up.

26:49.233 --> 26:52.487
- They can take curves
better than we can.

26:53.405 --> 26:54.572
- Tires.

26:54.572 --> 26:55.365
They're going for the tires.

26:55.365 --> 26:58.117
(bright music)

27:02.330 --> 27:03.122
Duct tape.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.498
Got any duct tape?

27:07.668 --> 27:08.462
- Hey.

27:08.462 --> 27:09.628
That's in my eyes.

27:09.628 --> 27:10.422
Ah.

27:12.632 --> 27:13.425
- Foul.

27:13.425 --> 27:14.550
Foul.

27:14.550 --> 27:16.135
You're going down.

27:16.135 --> 27:19.555
(bright music)

27:19.555 --> 27:20.890
You hear me?

27:20.890 --> 27:22.433
You're done.

27:22.433 --> 27:24.227
You're done.

27:24.227 --> 27:26.312
You're going down.

27:26.312 --> 27:27.105
Ah.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.608
(bright music)

27:34.487 --> 27:37.365
- (laughs) We rock.

27:37.365 --> 27:38.492
We rock.

27:38.492 --> 27:39.283
We rock.

27:39.283 --> 27:40.452
We rock.

27:40.452 --> 27:42.953
(bright music)

27:46.792 --> 27:48.627
- They beat us.

27:48.627 --> 27:50.587
- I don't think so.

27:50.587 --> 27:53.047
(bright music)

27:54.298 --> 27:55.425
- [Rachel] Woo.

27:55.425 --> 27:56.467
- Yeah.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.595
Victory dance, yeah.

27:59.595 --> 28:00.638
- Yeah.

28:00.638 --> 28:05.643
(bright music)
(truck knocking)

28:19.615 --> 28:20.742
- [Fairly] Where's
the lug wrench?

28:20.742 --> 28:22.118
- [Rachel] Under the seat.

28:24.870 --> 28:25.830
- Where's the jack?

28:29.125 --> 28:29.917
The jack?

28:32.337 --> 28:34.838
(gentle music)

28:37.550 --> 28:42.513
- So we go to change it
and we realize no jack.

28:42.513 --> 28:45.558
Somebody took it
to get the plow out

28:45.558 --> 28:46.935
and didn't put it back.

28:49.645 --> 28:50.647
Uh huh, yeah.

28:50.647 --> 28:52.315
Sure.

28:52.315 --> 28:53.650
Well, it doesn't really matter

28:53.650 --> 28:56.610
since we were close to
the drop off point anyway.

28:56.610 --> 28:59.363
If you could just drop off
the jack before we get back,

28:59.363 --> 29:00.573
we can take care of it.

29:02.533 --> 29:03.325
What's that?

29:04.202 --> 29:05.495
How's Fairly doing?

29:06.955 --> 29:11.250
Well, he's not as pathetic
as I thought he was.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.043
- Hey.

29:12.043 --> 29:14.503
- No, he's doing fine.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.923
He's very prepared.

29:18.758 --> 29:19.925
Yeah, we'll be there.

29:21.385 --> 29:22.137
Love you, too.

29:23.513 --> 29:24.305
Bye.

29:26.140 --> 29:28.727
- So your dad just lets you
go off on hikes like this?

29:28.727 --> 29:31.603
- My dad doesn't have say in it.

29:31.603 --> 29:32.605
He's dead.

29:32.605 --> 29:33.482
- Oh.

29:33.482 --> 29:34.732
I'm sorry.

29:34.732 --> 29:36.108
- Don't be.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.693
It's been.

29:37.693 --> 29:38.653
14.

29:39.570 --> 29:40.863
15.

29:40.863 --> 29:42.365
A lot of years.

29:43.700 --> 29:46.618
But my grandpa now, he lets
me get away with anything.

29:47.912 --> 29:50.498
Hey, we're here.

29:50.498 --> 29:52.083
- Where's our guide?

29:52.083 --> 29:52.875
- There.

29:54.418 --> 29:55.212
- Where?

29:55.212 --> 29:56.003
I don't see.

29:57.213 --> 29:58.715
(soft music)

29:58.715 --> 30:00.592
- [Rachel] Look familiar?

30:00.592 --> 30:02.052
- It can't be.

30:02.052 --> 30:03.678
(soft music)

30:03.678 --> 30:04.720
- Cliffs.

30:04.720 --> 30:05.555
Gorges.

30:05.555 --> 30:07.640
Vengeful ghosts.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.892
What part of that did you
think I was making up?

30:11.435 --> 30:13.270
Come on, he's telling
us to follow him.

30:13.270 --> 30:16.523
(soft music)

30:16.523 --> 30:17.608
What's the matter?

30:17.608 --> 30:19.693
- This is not possible.

30:19.693 --> 30:22.155
You were talking on your
cellphone just a second ago.

30:22.155 --> 30:23.532
It's not possible.

30:23.532 --> 30:25.533
- Are you coming or not?

30:25.533 --> 30:26.783
- My GPS.

30:26.783 --> 30:29.912
I'm gonna map this
whole thing on my GPS.

30:29.912 --> 30:30.872
Hey, wait, wait, wait, no.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.332
I'm coming, I'm coming.

30:32.332 --> 30:33.123
Hold on.

30:33.123 --> 30:35.668
(soft music)

30:54.020 --> 30:56.688
(bikes whirring)

30:59.442 --> 31:00.235
- Hold it.

31:00.235 --> 31:01.068
Stop, stop.

31:02.570 --> 31:03.613
Coach, it was your kid.

31:03.613 --> 31:05.407
It was your kid
that did this to us.

31:05.407 --> 31:06.657
- What on earth
have you been doing?

31:06.657 --> 31:08.367
- Just going after our
share of the treasure.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.702
Only they fought dirty.

31:09.702 --> 31:11.037
- Treasure?

31:11.037 --> 31:12.705
Oh, you must've been
talking to Fairly.

31:12.705 --> 31:13.707
- Darn right.

31:13.707 --> 31:16.250
He is so not a team player.

31:16.250 --> 31:17.752
- Your parents know you're here?

31:18.628 --> 31:19.837
- Probably not.

31:19.837 --> 31:21.463
- Like they ever care.

31:21.463 --> 31:23.215
- How would you like to
earn your share after all?

31:23.215 --> 31:24.508
- Forget it.

31:24.508 --> 31:25.843
There's probably
nothing up there.

31:25.843 --> 31:26.760
And anyways, we gotta
go home and fix these.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.763
- $100,000.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.267
A piece.

31:32.267 --> 31:34.810
If you help me
find that treasure.

31:35.728 --> 31:36.520
- Where is it?

31:36.520 --> 31:38.397
- Only the girl knows.

31:38.397 --> 31:39.773
- Then how are we supposed to.

31:41.317 --> 31:44.070
- Fairly, turn on your GPS.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.237
- It is on.

31:46.155 --> 31:48.867
(bright music)

31:51.953 --> 31:52.995
- [Riley] That's them?

31:52.995 --> 31:54.413
- That's wicked.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.040
- Come on, put those
machines in the back.

31:56.040 --> 31:57.833
We can fix them on the way.

31:57.833 --> 31:58.793
Game time.

31:58.793 --> 31:59.793
Move it, move it, move it.

31:59.793 --> 32:02.463
(bright music)

32:07.552 --> 32:08.887
- Need some help back there?

32:08.887 --> 32:10.305
- I got it, I got it.

32:12.640 --> 32:13.892
What's so funny?

32:13.892 --> 32:15.893
- You should've left
that junk in the car.

32:15.893 --> 32:17.812
You're just slowing us down.

32:17.812 --> 32:20.523
(bright music)

32:26.945 --> 32:27.738
- Dad.

32:27.738 --> 32:28.865
Hey Dad, are you there?

32:28.865 --> 32:29.907
- [Sanders] What is it?

32:31.075 --> 32:32.993
- We seem to be just
zigzagging up the hill.

32:32.993 --> 32:34.828
Is that how this trail goes?

32:34.828 --> 32:36.413
- [Sanders] Yeah, it's
called a switchback.

32:36.413 --> 32:39.042
It's how they gained elevation
without steep graves.

32:39.042 --> 32:41.793
- So you mean we could just
be going straight up the hill?

32:41.793 --> 32:42.962
- [Sanders] Don't
even think about it.

32:42.962 --> 32:45.548
Too steep and there's
a rock face further up.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.802
Fairly, I said don't
even think about it.

32:48.802 --> 32:49.843
- Yeah, Dad.

32:49.843 --> 32:50.762
Hey, Rachel.

32:50.762 --> 32:52.513
Do you wanna save some time?

32:52.513 --> 32:54.182
Like a lot of time?

32:55.975 --> 32:58.268
This is the only
way to go hiking.

33:04.525 --> 33:06.818
Still think I should've
left this junk behind?

33:06.818 --> 33:07.945
- How 'bout a hint here?

33:10.407 --> 33:12.242
- You're just slowing
us down, you know.

33:13.743 --> 33:14.743
What's the matter?

33:14.743 --> 33:15.995
You never been rock
climbing before?

33:15.995 --> 33:17.788
- [Rachel] I stick
to the trails.

33:18.790 --> 33:20.332
- Okay, it's safe to come up.

33:21.875 --> 33:22.793
No, don't climb like that.

33:22.793 --> 33:23.920
You'll get tired.

33:23.920 --> 33:24.795
Use the hand holds.

33:24.795 --> 33:26.130
There's one on your left.

33:28.298 --> 33:30.133
(dramatic music)

33:30.133 --> 33:31.468
Rachel, grab the rock.

33:31.468 --> 33:34.138
(dramatic music)

33:35.222 --> 33:36.182
Carabiner.

33:36.182 --> 33:36.973
Undue your carabiner.

33:36.973 --> 33:37.767
- What?

33:37.767 --> 33:38.852
- This, this.

33:38.852 --> 33:41.562
(dramatic music)

34:09.798 --> 34:10.800
Rachel.

34:13.010 --> 34:15.722
(dramatic music)

35:04.937 --> 35:07.940
(suspenseful music)

36:18.052 --> 36:19.095
Thanks.

36:23.598 --> 36:25.308
- [Sanders] Fairly, have
you cleared the hill yet?

36:25.308 --> 36:26.852
Are you all right?

36:26.852 --> 36:27.645
Answer me.

36:29.980 --> 36:31.357
- That thing still works?

36:31.357 --> 36:32.442
- Unfortunately.

36:32.442 --> 36:35.027
- Fairly, I'm talking to you.

36:35.027 --> 36:36.778
Fairly.

36:36.778 --> 36:38.030
Idiot.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.073
I knew he'd do this.

36:39.073 --> 36:41.075
He was always doing
this when he was a kid.

36:41.075 --> 36:42.200
Trying to wander
off into the woods

36:42.200 --> 36:43.660
and get his neck broken.

36:43.660 --> 36:45.913
Kid's got the survival
instincts of a lemming.

36:45.913 --> 36:48.332
- [Riley] Coach, I told
you he's not a team player.

36:50.918 --> 36:51.710
Ah.

36:55.338 --> 36:57.090
- [Fairly] GPS is shot.

36:57.090 --> 36:58.842
My dad's going to kill me.

36:58.842 --> 37:01.220
- So, tell him he's
lucky to have the chance.

37:01.220 --> 37:02.012
- Yeah.

37:04.515 --> 37:06.975
- Cellphone's shot, too.

37:06.975 --> 37:07.977
Hang on a sec.

37:07.977 --> 37:09.020
- Okay.

37:11.938 --> 37:12.732
Well?

37:18.028 --> 37:20.990
Well at least we can get lost
in any direction we want.

37:20.990 --> 37:23.367
(gun firing)

37:23.367 --> 37:24.618
What was that?

37:24.618 --> 37:26.162
- Rifle shot.

37:26.162 --> 37:27.203
- Seriously.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.830
- Could be hunters
thinking we're game.

37:28.830 --> 37:31.208
(gun firing)

37:31.208 --> 37:32.000
- Hunters?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.043
It's summer.

37:33.043 --> 37:34.587
- Well, maybe we're
on someone's land

37:34.587 --> 37:36.047
and he's telling us to leave.

37:36.047 --> 37:37.590
- No way.

37:37.590 --> 37:39.008
- Works better than a no
trespassing sign, doesn't it?

37:39.008 --> 37:41.552
(gun firing)

37:42.428 --> 37:43.303
- [Fairly] No kidding.

37:43.303 --> 37:44.430
- Wait.

37:44.430 --> 37:45.222
We're lost.

37:45.222 --> 37:46.473
He'll know where we are.

37:46.473 --> 37:47.392
- Do you wanna just go out there

37:47.392 --> 37:48.683
and ask him for directions?

37:51.645 --> 37:53.813
- Hey, you up there.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.232
Stop shooting.

37:55.232 --> 37:56.358
Stop it.

37:57.818 --> 37:58.693
Can you hear me?

37:59.528 --> 38:01.280
We're lost.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.323
Can you hear?

38:03.615 --> 38:05.242
(gentle music)

38:05.242 --> 38:07.035
Did you hear me?

38:07.035 --> 38:09.497
We got here by accident.

38:09.497 --> 38:10.665
We need help.

38:12.123 --> 38:15.002
If you just tell us where
we are, we'll leave.

38:15.002 --> 38:16.587
That's all we want.

38:16.587 --> 38:19.048
(gentle music)

38:25.763 --> 38:26.680
- Your names.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.558
What are your names?

38:29.558 --> 38:30.475
- Rachel Cather.

38:32.185 --> 38:33.020
- Fairly.

38:33.020 --> 38:34.272
- Fairly what?

38:34.272 --> 38:35.272
- Sanders.

38:35.272 --> 38:36.398
Fairly Sanders.

38:36.398 --> 38:39.110
(gentle music)

38:44.532 --> 38:45.282
- 'Bout dinner time.

38:45.282 --> 38:46.075
Come on.

38:55.710 --> 38:56.502
- Thanks for lunch.

38:56.502 --> 38:57.753
We really appreciate it.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.463
- What is it
brought you up here?

39:00.463 --> 39:01.798
- We're treasure hunting.

39:02.800 --> 39:03.967
- Is that so?

39:03.967 --> 39:05.385
- Sort of.

39:05.385 --> 39:08.347
We heard about an old ghost
town called Cascadia Crest.

39:08.347 --> 39:10.432
We thought it would
be fun if we found it.

39:10.432 --> 39:11.600
- You have.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.227
This is all that's left.

39:13.227 --> 39:14.603
The rest of it was out there.

39:15.813 --> 39:18.440
- There isn't anything
at a high elevation?

39:18.440 --> 39:19.817
- Nope.

39:19.817 --> 39:21.610
Now is that all
you came here for?

39:24.322 --> 39:27.157
- We're looking for
the Cascadia treasure.

39:27.157 --> 39:28.575
Can you help us?

39:28.575 --> 39:29.493
- Yes.

39:29.493 --> 39:31.245
Turn around, go home.

39:31.245 --> 39:33.205
Forget you ever heard of it.

39:33.205 --> 39:34.248
- Why?

39:34.248 --> 39:36.417
- Because of everyone
who came before you.

39:36.417 --> 39:40.670
The three gold seekers
who drowned in a
flooded shaft in 68.

39:40.670 --> 39:43.132
Four more in the cave in in 72.

39:43.132 --> 39:45.092
And the ones in 79.

39:45.092 --> 39:47.762
All anyone ever heard from
them again were screams.

39:47.762 --> 39:50.263
- So what got them?

39:50.263 --> 39:52.223
- Haven't you heard the legend?

39:52.223 --> 39:55.393
- Yeah, I've heard it
and I'm sick of it.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.645
I want facts.

39:56.645 --> 39:57.522
No more ghosts.

39:57.522 --> 39:58.313
No more legends.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.065
Facts.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.317
- Gold fever is stubborn.

40:02.317 --> 40:05.153
I've been up here all my life.

40:05.153 --> 40:09.158
Long time ago when there was
still a town, I had a son.

40:09.158 --> 40:10.158
I had a husband.

40:11.535 --> 40:13.037
He was a good man.

40:13.037 --> 40:15.413
All tall, solid, and practical.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.250
He understood there were a
lot of things he couldn't see.

40:20.210 --> 40:21.087
But our son could.

40:22.003 --> 40:25.423
(dramatic music)

40:25.423 --> 40:26.467
The mines were dying.

40:26.467 --> 40:27.927
The town was dying.

40:27.927 --> 40:29.178
It was making him desperate.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.515
Desperate enough
to follow a ghost

40:32.515 --> 40:35.852
down an abandoned mine
if that's what it took.

40:35.852 --> 40:39.272
(dramatic music)

40:39.272 --> 40:40.857
They both should've
known better.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.652
(dramatic music)

40:48.155 --> 40:49.407
- Did they get out?

40:50.740 --> 40:54.035
- Something came out but
it wasn't my boy anymore.

40:54.035 --> 40:54.787
- I'm sorry.

40:56.038 --> 40:56.955
- Heard enough yet?

40:58.290 --> 40:59.792
- Shows us where this happened.

41:01.210 --> 41:03.378
- Gold fever never learns.

41:05.755 --> 41:06.507
I'll show you.

41:16.267 --> 41:17.810
- [Rachel] What's this?

41:17.810 --> 41:18.893
- That's the interest.

41:18.893 --> 41:20.728
The old Cascadia mine.

41:20.728 --> 41:23.190
They dynamited it
shut years ago.

41:23.190 --> 41:24.525
- [Rachel] Dynamited it?

41:24.525 --> 41:27.068
- How many deaths do
you think they'd allow?

41:27.068 --> 41:28.653
- [Fairly] And the treasure?

41:28.653 --> 41:29.863
- The mountain gave it.

41:29.863 --> 41:31.282
The mountain took it back.

41:31.282 --> 41:32.700
Nothing more to be said.

41:33.908 --> 41:36.287
You finished chasing ghosts now?

41:37.913 --> 41:38.913
Good.

41:38.913 --> 41:40.248
Follow the tracks.

41:40.248 --> 41:42.877
They'll take you out
the way you came.

41:42.877 --> 41:44.043
- Thanks for your help.

41:46.172 --> 41:47.882
- [Fairly] Yeah, thanks.

41:47.882 --> 41:50.758
- Before you go, you
ought to have this.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.803
- Thanks, but we
brought flashlights.

41:52.803 --> 41:54.137
- Worthless things.

41:54.137 --> 41:56.390
Always going dead at the
worst possible moment.

41:56.390 --> 41:57.808
Take it.

41:57.808 --> 41:58.892
- [Rachel] I don't know
when we can bring it back.

41:58.892 --> 42:00.477
- Then don't bother.

42:00.477 --> 42:03.397
At least you won't leave
these mountains empty handed.

42:03.397 --> 42:04.147
Goodbye.

42:07.525 --> 42:08.610
- But wait a second.

42:08.610 --> 42:09.695
What's your name?

42:11.113 --> 42:12.030
Wait.

42:12.030 --> 42:13.532
What's your name?

42:13.532 --> 42:15.993
(soft music)

42:15.993 --> 42:17.493
- [Fairly] Guess that's it.

42:17.493 --> 42:19.203
May as well go.

42:19.203 --> 42:20.038
- She's lying.

42:21.165 --> 42:21.998
- What?

42:21.998 --> 42:23.500
- She's lying.

42:23.500 --> 42:24.252
The tracks don't end here.

42:24.252 --> 42:25.752
It doesn't make sense.

42:25.752 --> 42:26.962
- Why?

42:26.962 --> 42:27.880
- They didn't mine
gold at this elevation.

42:27.880 --> 42:28.755
They only panned it.

42:28.755 --> 42:30.173
The mines are higher.

42:30.173 --> 42:31.633
Way higher.

42:31.633 --> 42:33.510
- But the tracks go
right into the ground.

42:33.510 --> 42:36.013
- Yeah, they do, and I
bet they come out again.

42:36.013 --> 42:37.388
This building wasn't
from the mining era.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.973
It's from much later.

42:42.143 --> 42:42.895
There, see?

42:44.397 --> 42:45.563
Come on.

42:45.563 --> 42:48.275
(gentle music)

43:06.710 --> 43:08.087
- William.

43:08.087 --> 43:09.463
What are you trying to tell me?

43:12.340 --> 43:13.883
- So it's a full court press.

43:13.883 --> 43:15.177
Scores 11 to 12.

43:15.177 --> 43:16.345
Their favor.

43:16.345 --> 43:18.347
15 seconds left on the clock.

43:18.347 --> 43:19.723
I'm on the sideline.

43:19.723 --> 43:20.975
I see an opening.

43:20.975 --> 43:21.767
I can make it.

43:21.767 --> 43:22.558
I can do it.

43:22.558 --> 43:23.852
All I need's the ball.

43:23.852 --> 43:26.147
And which putz do they
give it to instead?

43:26.147 --> 43:26.938
- Tristan?

43:26.938 --> 43:27.732
- Yeah, Tristan.

43:27.732 --> 43:29.273
Daddy's little pissant.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.652
Five feet tall, dribbles
like a two-year-old.

43:31.652 --> 43:32.987
So there's 10 seconds left

43:32.987 --> 43:34.822
and he's moving to
the speed of crap

43:34.822 --> 43:37.115
and I'm thinking, this
is just not right.

43:37.115 --> 43:39.827
That ball belongs to someone
who knows how to handle it.

43:39.827 --> 43:40.618
- Like you.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.245
- No duh.

43:42.245 --> 43:44.163
So I did what I freaking had to.

43:44.163 --> 43:45.415
I took the ball.

43:45.415 --> 43:46.542
- You fouled your own guy?

43:46.542 --> 43:47.752
- I did not foul him.

43:47.752 --> 43:49.043
- But didn't he go down on--

43:49.043 --> 43:50.545
- He fell over his
own stupid butt.

43:50.545 --> 43:51.547
So I took the ball.

43:51.547 --> 43:52.882
Ran right down the court.

43:52.882 --> 43:54.383
Right between the two guards.

43:54.383 --> 43:55.383
I jump.

43:55.383 --> 43:56.302
I toss it.

43:56.302 --> 43:57.635
Swoosh.

43:57.635 --> 44:00.013
Three points and three
seconds left on the clock.

44:00.013 --> 44:01.682
Tell me I didn't rock.

44:01.682 --> 44:04.225
- So that's why coach benched
you the next two games.

44:04.225 --> 44:06.895
- No, that's why we
lost the next two games.

44:06.895 --> 44:08.480
- Didn't you lose
that game, too?

44:08.480 --> 44:10.065
A little rules violation.

44:11.608 --> 44:12.358
Ow.

44:12.358 --> 44:13.735
- Would've lost anyway.

44:13.735 --> 44:15.445
You know, if you want a
shot of winning anything,

44:15.445 --> 44:16.822
you gotta grab the ball.

44:16.822 --> 44:17.613
- Yeah, but--

44:17.613 --> 44:18.407
- [Riley] Sh.

44:19.575 --> 44:20.450
- [Fairly] I just don't get it.

44:20.450 --> 44:21.743
Why would she lie?

44:21.743 --> 44:24.747
- [Rachel] Maybe she's
protecting the treasure.

44:24.747 --> 44:26.498
Maybe she's really
concerned about us.

44:26.498 --> 44:27.708
I have no idea.

44:28.542 --> 44:30.752
- Well, maybe she's a ghost.

44:32.628 --> 44:36.300
I got the strangest feeling
when we were talking to her.

44:37.592 --> 44:38.718
Like I knew her.

44:38.718 --> 44:39.512
- From where?

44:40.803 --> 44:41.597
- I don't know.

44:43.098 --> 44:44.642
Didn't you get
that feeling, too?

44:44.642 --> 44:45.433
- Mm mm.

44:46.518 --> 44:48.020
- Maybe I'm just going nuts.

44:49.353 --> 44:51.815
- You should listen
to things like that.

44:51.815 --> 44:53.525
Memories, old stories

44:53.525 --> 44:56.528
'cause if they stick with
you, you're not nuts.

44:56.528 --> 44:58.613
They're trying to
tell you something.

45:00.448 --> 45:03.243
- There's some seriously
weird stuff going down here.

45:11.042 --> 45:15.963
(bike whirring)
(gentle music)

45:44.868 --> 45:46.120
- Dad, Dad, come in please.

45:46.120 --> 45:46.912
Dad.

45:47.745 --> 45:50.623
Dad, we're in trouble, Dad.

45:50.623 --> 45:52.542
Dad, where are you?

45:52.542 --> 45:54.293
Help us, help us.

45:54.293 --> 45:55.753
- I'm right here, Fairly.

45:55.753 --> 45:56.797
What do you need?

45:56.797 --> 45:57.713
- Riley and Colton.

45:57.713 --> 45:58.965
They're trying to run us down.

45:58.965 --> 45:59.842
- Be serious.

45:59.842 --> 46:01.677
- I am being serious.

46:01.677 --> 46:03.720
(gentle music)
(bike whirring)

46:03.720 --> 46:04.722
- Head for the bridge.

46:04.722 --> 46:05.638
- The bridge?

46:05.638 --> 46:06.932
- On the grade ahead of you.

46:06.932 --> 46:09.727
You get across it,
they can't touch you.

46:09.727 --> 46:14.648
(gentle music)
(bike whirring)

46:15.982 --> 46:17.067
- [Riley] Come on, bring it on.

46:17.067 --> 46:18.568
Dual wishbone suspension.

46:18.568 --> 46:19.528
450 CC engine.

46:19.528 --> 46:22.280
Dual caliber all wheels.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.573
Bring it on.

46:23.573 --> 46:27.410
(gentle music)
(bike whirring)

46:27.410 --> 46:29.203
Bring it on, man.

46:29.203 --> 46:34.208
(gentle music)
(bike whirring)

46:44.720 --> 46:47.763
- (chuckles) Wow.

46:50.267 --> 46:51.602
- [Riley] No, don't.

46:51.602 --> 46:53.812
Please, please, don't.

46:53.812 --> 46:55.063
- I'm not gonna hit ya.

46:55.063 --> 46:57.065
- [Riley] Please
don't take my bike.

47:07.993 --> 47:09.703
- That was so cool.

47:10.662 --> 47:12.663
- I must be insane.

47:12.663 --> 47:13.790
Totally insane.

47:13.790 --> 47:14.958
I'm even worse than he is.

47:14.958 --> 47:17.710
- You sure know how to
make it work for you.

47:17.710 --> 47:20.547
(bike whirring)

47:21.340 --> 47:22.257
- Owned.

47:22.257 --> 47:23.717
You just got owned (laughs).

47:31.140 --> 47:32.350
- We gotta go, quick.

47:32.350 --> 47:33.352
- Where?

47:33.352 --> 47:34.143
- To the bridge.

47:34.143 --> 47:34.937
Come on.

47:43.653 --> 47:44.905
- [Riley] Tell you what.

47:44.905 --> 47:45.988
You can borrow mine.

47:47.032 --> 47:48.825
You're going down.

47:48.825 --> 47:52.578
(gentle music)
(bike whirring)

47:52.578 --> 47:53.747
- Your pack's weighing you down.

47:53.747 --> 47:54.957
Just ditch it.

47:54.957 --> 47:59.962
(gentle music)
(bike whirring)

48:22.943 --> 48:24.612
Come on, come on.

48:24.612 --> 48:29.365
(gentle music)
(bike whirring)

48:29.365 --> 48:32.368
(suspenseful music)

48:53.557 --> 48:54.348
- Help.

48:55.267 --> 48:56.893
Help me.

48:56.893 --> 48:58.062
- Hang on.

48:58.062 --> 48:58.853
I'm coming.

48:58.853 --> 48:59.897
- [Riley] Stay.

48:59.897 --> 49:00.688
- But he needs help.

49:00.688 --> 49:01.982
- Stay, boy.

49:01.982 --> 49:02.773
Stay.

49:04.442 --> 49:05.777
- What's the matter with you?

49:05.777 --> 49:07.028
Help him, you idiot.

49:07.028 --> 49:08.822
- Why don't you
hang back for once?

49:11.658 --> 49:13.035
This is what we want.

49:13.035 --> 49:14.787
We want to come with you.

49:14.787 --> 49:16.955
We want our share
of the treasure.

49:16.955 --> 49:17.872
Hurry up and say yes.

49:17.872 --> 49:19.165
This guy can't hold on for long.

49:19.165 --> 49:20.875
- You serious?

49:23.087 --> 49:24.880
No, wait.

49:24.880 --> 49:25.672
You got it.

49:26.798 --> 49:28.633
- Say it like you mean it.

49:28.633 --> 49:29.885
- Yes, just help him.

49:34.848 --> 49:35.890
- Come on, dude.

49:37.350 --> 49:38.143
Pull yourself up.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.397
Dude, come on.

49:41.397 --> 49:42.730
You're making me nervous.

49:44.065 --> 49:44.858
- Rachel.

49:46.943 --> 49:49.697
(gentle music)

50:13.845 --> 50:15.263
Thanks.

50:15.263 --> 50:18.517
- How many times am I gonna
have to save your butt today?

50:18.517 --> 50:19.308
- I'll make it up to you.

50:19.308 --> 50:20.935
I promise.

50:20.935 --> 50:25.065
- Fairly, don't you ever turn
off your radio on me again.

50:26.775 --> 50:28.568
- Miss Rachel, don't forget now.

50:28.568 --> 50:30.487
Part of that treasure's ours.

50:30.487 --> 50:32.655
You said yes, remember?

50:32.655 --> 50:34.742
- Go find your
own lost treasure.

50:34.742 --> 50:36.283
- This is not over.

50:36.283 --> 50:38.203
The game's still
on and we're ahead.

50:38.203 --> 50:42.248
We're ahead in ways you can't
even understand, Miss Rachel.

50:43.125 --> 50:44.583
- Let's get outta here.

50:44.583 --> 50:45.543
- Right behind you.

50:48.922 --> 50:51.592
(dramatic music)

50:58.932 --> 51:01.602
(gentle music)

51:08.858 --> 51:10.610
How much farther?

51:10.610 --> 51:12.237
- Can't be much farther.

51:12.237 --> 51:15.032
They didn't mine gold
much higher than this.

51:15.032 --> 51:16.992
- You sure they didn't
find any on the moon?

51:18.952 --> 51:20.078
- Fairly, keep going.

51:20.078 --> 51:21.747
You're on the home stretch.

51:21.747 --> 51:24.332
(bike whirring)

51:26.042 --> 51:27.002
- Hey, what's the rush?

51:39.848 --> 51:42.350
(gentle music)

51:48.190 --> 51:53.195
(gentle music)
(bike whirring)

51:58.367 --> 52:00.660
- [Riley] Do I get
the keys back yet?

52:00.660 --> 52:02.037
- Are you gonna stick
to doing exactly

52:02.037 --> 52:04.163
what I say and no
embellishments?

52:04.163 --> 52:05.790
- [Riley] Maybe.

52:05.790 --> 52:06.542
- Forget it.

52:07.833 --> 52:10.253
(gentle music)

52:15.800 --> 52:17.052
- [Fairly] What's
all this stuff for?

52:17.052 --> 52:18.970
- I recognize a few things.

52:18.970 --> 52:20.722
That's a wench.

52:20.722 --> 52:22.515
That's their powder magazine.

52:22.515 --> 52:25.018
That's a truck engine.

52:25.018 --> 52:27.603
I'm not sure what
they use that for.

52:27.603 --> 52:32.358
This is a steam engine, I think.

52:32.358 --> 52:35.028
They used it to take
the ore out of the mine

52:35.028 --> 52:36.362
and down the mountain.

52:36.362 --> 52:38.615
- It's a compressed
air locomotive.

52:38.615 --> 52:39.908
- It runs on compressed air.

52:41.660 --> 52:43.495
- They charge it and
pulled ore trains out

52:43.495 --> 52:45.330
with no exhaust gasses.

52:45.330 --> 52:47.457
- Yeah, they'd fill it with.

52:47.457 --> 52:48.750
They'd fill the tank and use it

52:48.750 --> 52:51.210
to run into the mine
without any emissions.

52:51.210 --> 52:53.087
- Where'd you learn that?

52:53.087 --> 52:54.838
- I'm not a total
idiot, you know.

52:56.132 --> 52:59.593
(pipe hissing)

52:59.593 --> 53:00.387
Cool.

53:04.515 --> 53:07.310
- That pipe pumped water
out of the deepest shafts.

53:07.310 --> 53:09.478
The conduit ran to
an electric bell.

53:09.478 --> 53:11.480
That was how they
signaled a come up.

53:11.480 --> 53:12.898
The truck engine--

53:12.898 --> 53:14.943
- Was used to pull carts
up out of the line.

53:14.943 --> 53:17.653
(gentle music)

53:21.575 --> 53:22.325
Ready?

53:22.325 --> 53:23.452
- Hang on.

53:23.452 --> 53:24.577
Let's use the lantern.

53:25.953 --> 53:26.997
- What for?

53:26.997 --> 53:28.290
- Bad air.

53:28.290 --> 53:30.458
Anywhere a flame can't
survive, neither can we.

53:30.458 --> 53:32.960
(gentle music)

53:39.300 --> 53:40.427
Let's go.

53:40.427 --> 53:43.178
(gentle music)

53:54.983 --> 53:58.193
- Now remember, whatever you
say, keep it to a whisper

53:58.193 --> 53:59.278
or don't talk at all.

53:59.278 --> 54:00.697
Just the slightest vibration.

54:00.697 --> 54:03.073
- From our voices could
cause a rock fall.

54:03.073 --> 54:04.617
- And also watch the ceiling.

54:04.617 --> 54:05.952
If it goes up, chances are--

54:05.952 --> 54:08.162
- We're walking
on a false floor.

54:08.162 --> 54:08.955
- False floor?

54:10.332 --> 54:11.958
- Sometimes they'd sink a
shaft from these tunnels.

54:11.958 --> 54:14.127
- Hundreds of feet deep.

54:14.127 --> 54:15.503
Then they covered
that with boards

54:15.503 --> 54:19.048
and then it'd get covered
up with gravel and dirt.

54:19.048 --> 54:20.467
Now it's all rotted.

54:20.467 --> 54:22.177
Total death trap.

54:22.177 --> 54:24.637
(gentle music)

54:26.472 --> 54:30.893
Also, watch out for
snakes, bears, wild cat.

54:33.103 --> 54:35.190
Animals like to
live in old mines.

54:35.190 --> 54:37.067
- Whatever you do,
don't get scared.

54:37.067 --> 54:38.318
Don't panic.

54:38.318 --> 54:40.403
It'll make you see
things that aren't there.

54:40.403 --> 54:42.113
Remember it's just a mine.

54:42.113 --> 54:44.365
It's just an old
hole in the ground.

54:44.365 --> 54:46.242
(gentle music)

54:46.242 --> 54:47.035
- What's that?

54:47.035 --> 54:47.827
What's the matter?

54:47.827 --> 54:48.870
- Him.

54:48.870 --> 54:52.123
(gentle music)

54:52.123 --> 54:53.248
- We're fine.

54:53.248 --> 54:54.583
We'll be fine.

54:54.583 --> 54:55.710
- Just a little further.

54:55.710 --> 54:56.795
- Just a little farther.

54:56.795 --> 54:57.753
- You're almost there.

54:57.753 --> 54:59.172
- Almost there.

54:59.172 --> 55:01.925
(gentle music)

55:04.218 --> 55:05.553
- Oh no.

55:05.553 --> 55:06.680
- Shoot.

55:06.680 --> 55:07.763
Guess that's it then.

55:09.723 --> 55:11.308
Where are you going?

55:11.308 --> 55:13.268
- Just wanna see something.

55:13.268 --> 55:14.687
- This place is creeping me out.

55:14.687 --> 55:15.480
Come on.

55:15.480 --> 55:17.148
- It's just an old mine.

55:17.148 --> 55:18.692
An old hole in the ground.

55:18.692 --> 55:21.193
- [Sanders] Fairly,
have you found it yet?

55:21.193 --> 55:22.737
- No.

55:22.737 --> 55:23.905
I'm getting out of here.

55:23.905 --> 55:25.323
- Wait.

55:25.323 --> 55:27.158
Point your light at the ceiling.

55:27.158 --> 55:29.910
(gentle music)

55:35.625 --> 55:37.252
- Get out of there.

55:38.252 --> 55:39.295
Rachel.

55:39.295 --> 55:40.588
- What's going on?

55:40.588 --> 55:41.380
- Rachel.

55:42.673 --> 55:44.258
Rachel.

55:44.258 --> 55:45.718
- Don't shout, you idiot.

55:45.718 --> 55:47.262
Don't shout.

55:47.262 --> 55:49.972
- [Fairly] Rachel, Rachel,
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel, Rachel.

55:53.017 --> 55:54.310
- What's happened?

55:54.310 --> 55:55.062
Tell me.

55:55.937 --> 55:56.730
- It's Rachel.

55:57.855 --> 55:59.315
She fell down a shaft.

55:59.315 --> 56:00.108
I can't see her.

56:01.150 --> 56:02.193
- Get out.

56:03.027 --> 56:04.028
Get out.

56:04.028 --> 56:05.322
He's got her.

56:05.322 --> 56:06.155
He'll get you too if
you don't get out.

56:06.155 --> 56:07.198
Get out.

56:10.702 --> 56:11.787
Go to the entrance.

56:11.787 --> 56:12.578
I'll meet you.

56:15.248 --> 56:17.958
(dramatic music)

56:23.297 --> 56:26.050
(gentle music)

56:32.807 --> 56:34.850
- I'm gonna get her out.

56:34.850 --> 56:36.102
- What was that?

56:36.102 --> 56:38.020
- I'm getting her out.

56:38.020 --> 56:38.938
- You can't.

56:38.938 --> 56:39.855
- I heard a crash.

56:39.855 --> 56:41.817
That shaft can't be bottomless.

56:41.817 --> 56:43.275
I can reach it with a rope.

56:43.275 --> 56:44.318
- Fairly, no.

56:44.318 --> 56:45.487
You'll get yourself killed.

56:45.487 --> 56:47.197
- I can get down to the
bottom in one minute

56:47.197 --> 56:49.032
and I can get back out in five.

56:49.032 --> 56:50.283
- This is idiotic.

56:50.283 --> 56:51.283
Get out.

56:51.283 --> 56:52.660
Out.

56:52.660 --> 56:55.163
(gentle music)

56:57.082 --> 56:58.667
Fairly, we'll come back.

56:58.667 --> 57:00.210
We'll bring rescuers.

57:00.210 --> 57:01.377
It's the smart thing to do.

57:03.463 --> 57:05.548
You don't know
what's down there.

57:05.548 --> 57:08.383
Flooded shafts, old
machinery, acid pits.

57:08.383 --> 57:09.593
Get out.

57:09.593 --> 57:10.928
- Going off the radio now.

57:10.928 --> 57:12.347
I'll be back in six minutes.

57:13.430 --> 57:14.390
- Fairly?

57:14.390 --> 57:16.267
Fairly.

57:16.267 --> 57:21.272
(dramatic music)
(bike whirring)

57:33.993 --> 57:35.245
- [Colton] Yo.

57:35.245 --> 57:36.537
Wait.

57:36.537 --> 57:38.205
Wait for me.

57:38.205 --> 57:40.917
(gentle music)

57:50.510 --> 57:52.137
- Dad, Dad.

57:52.137 --> 57:53.638
Fire.

57:53.638 --> 57:58.643
(gentle music)
(boy coughing)

58:22.292 --> 58:23.333
Ah.

58:27.880 --> 58:30.592
(fire crackling)

58:41.060 --> 58:41.852
Rachel.

58:42.728 --> 58:43.520
Rachel.

58:46.482 --> 58:48.108
Don't, don't move.

58:58.662 --> 58:59.453
- Fairly.

59:00.455 --> 59:01.497
Fairly.

59:01.497 --> 59:02.290
Fairly.

59:04.708 --> 59:05.627
Get in there.

59:05.627 --> 59:06.877
Find him.

59:06.877 --> 59:07.295
- [Riley] I don't
think that's such a--

59:07.295 --> 59:08.253
- Go.

59:12.383 --> 59:15.093
(fire crackling)

59:21.475 --> 59:23.518
- Find anything?

59:23.518 --> 59:26.522
- Just the huge garbage heap.

59:26.522 --> 59:29.067
I don't know how we're
gonna get out of here.

59:29.067 --> 59:31.402
I must've left that
rope 20 feet up.

59:32.820 --> 59:34.697
- Well, look.

59:34.697 --> 59:36.740
The smoke's going up that shaft

59:36.740 --> 59:39.368
and there's a draft
coming from over there.

59:39.368 --> 59:40.745
So it must come out somewhere.

59:42.622 --> 59:44.207
We better go see.

59:44.207 --> 59:46.042
(gentle music)

59:46.042 --> 59:46.833
Fairly?

59:47.752 --> 59:48.543
Let's go see.

59:51.713 --> 59:53.173
Fairly.

59:53.173 --> 59:54.425
Fairly, look.

59:54.425 --> 59:57.095
(dramatic music)

1:00:00.390 --> 1:00:01.432
- What happened?

1:00:01.432 --> 1:00:02.350
Where is he?

1:00:02.350 --> 1:00:03.727
- Can't see anything.

1:00:03.727 --> 1:00:05.895
This whole place is
filled up with smoke.

1:00:05.895 --> 1:00:08.355
(gentle music)

1:00:15.070 --> 1:00:16.280
- [Fairly] Ah.

1:00:17.407 --> 1:00:19.867
(gentle music)

1:00:33.505 --> 1:00:36.008
(gun firing)

1:01:00.575 --> 1:01:03.243
(bomb exploding)

1:01:09.833 --> 1:01:11.043
- Whoa.

1:01:11.043 --> 1:01:11.710
- Air burst.

1:01:11.710 --> 1:01:12.503
Air burst.

1:01:12.503 --> 1:01:14.172
Look out.

1:01:14.172 --> 1:01:16.840
(cave exploding)

1:01:22.888 --> 1:01:25.558
(static hissing)

1:01:44.452 --> 1:01:45.243
Fairly.

1:02:01.510 --> 1:02:04.222
(gentle music)

1:02:38.547 --> 1:02:41.133
(bike whirring)

1:02:44.762 --> 1:02:48.307
(tires screeching)

1:02:48.307 --> 1:02:49.933
- Hello, Gee.

1:02:49.933 --> 1:02:52.603
- Ma, what are you doing here?

1:02:52.603 --> 1:02:55.607
- It's nice to see my
grandson again, Gee.

1:02:55.607 --> 1:02:58.442
They came across my
cabin on the way up.

1:02:58.442 --> 1:02:59.360
I gave them dinner.

1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:01.362
- What did you tell them?

1:03:01.362 --> 1:03:02.655
- Nothing.

1:03:02.655 --> 1:03:05.492
No point in burdening
him with the past.

1:03:05.492 --> 1:03:07.493
I tried to keep
them from going on,

1:03:07.493 --> 1:03:08.995
but something got
a hold of them.

1:03:09.953 --> 1:03:12.122
He was a nice boy, Gee.

1:03:12.122 --> 1:03:13.498
Nice girl with him, too.

1:03:14.667 --> 1:03:15.918
Too bad.

1:03:15.918 --> 1:03:17.420
- It's not too late.

1:03:17.420 --> 1:03:18.503
I'll find him.

1:03:18.503 --> 1:03:19.713
- You'll find his corpse.

1:03:19.713 --> 1:03:20.673
- He's still alive.

1:03:20.673 --> 1:03:21.965
I know it.

1:03:21.965 --> 1:03:24.635
- Go find my
grandson's body alone.

1:03:26.678 --> 1:03:29.390
(gentle music)

1:03:32.768 --> 1:03:34.395
- [Fairly] Dad,
are you picking up?

1:03:34.395 --> 1:03:35.605
Dad.

1:03:35.605 --> 1:03:37.147
- Fairly, is that you?

1:03:37.147 --> 1:03:38.315
- [Fairly] Yeah, it's me.

1:03:38.315 --> 1:03:39.192
I'm fine.

1:03:39.192 --> 1:03:40.025
- You mean.

1:03:40.025 --> 1:03:40.818
- [Fairly] What?

1:03:40.818 --> 1:03:41.610
I'm fine.

1:03:42.695 --> 1:03:43.612
- Did you hear that, Ma?

1:03:43.612 --> 1:03:44.780
Ma, he's alive.

1:03:44.780 --> 1:03:45.948
He's all right.

1:03:45.948 --> 1:03:46.740
You hear me?

1:03:48.117 --> 1:03:49.702
- [Fairly] What's going on?

1:03:49.702 --> 1:03:50.745
- Nothing.

1:03:50.745 --> 1:03:51.703
Everything's fine.

1:03:52.788 --> 1:03:53.998
- Rachel's fine, too.

1:03:53.998 --> 1:03:55.207
We both got out.

1:03:55.207 --> 1:03:56.958
We were insanely lucky.

1:03:56.958 --> 1:03:57.960
- Tell me where you are.

1:03:57.960 --> 1:03:59.045
I'll come get you.

1:03:59.045 --> 1:04:00.045
- Dad, there's more.

1:04:01.005 --> 1:04:02.465
We found it.

1:04:02.465 --> 1:04:03.215
- Found what?

1:04:04.092 --> 1:04:05.635
- The treasure.

1:04:05.635 --> 1:04:06.593
We've got it.

1:04:07.637 --> 1:04:08.720
- You do?

1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:10.347
- Yeah, it's just
like everyone said.

1:04:10.347 --> 1:04:12.767
It's a freaking
huge heap of gold.

1:04:12.767 --> 1:04:13.808
- Tell me where.

1:04:13.808 --> 1:04:15.978
We'll loaded it up and
get it out of here.

1:04:15.978 --> 1:04:17.563
- Not yet.

1:04:17.563 --> 1:04:18.772
- [Sanders] Why not?

1:04:18.772 --> 1:04:19.732
- I'll explain later.

1:04:19.732 --> 1:04:22.610
Just tell me where
you're gonna be tonight.

1:04:22.610 --> 1:04:24.028
- Okay well, we can
set up a camp here.

1:04:24.028 --> 1:04:25.905
We're on the Cootney Pass Road

1:04:25.905 --> 1:04:27.407
at the bottom of the valley.

1:04:27.407 --> 1:04:29.200
Probably straight south of you.

1:04:29.200 --> 1:04:29.992
We'll build a fire.

1:04:29.992 --> 1:04:31.202
Just follow the light.

1:04:31.202 --> 1:04:32.537
- Okay.

1:04:32.537 --> 1:04:33.787
- Fairly.

1:04:33.787 --> 1:04:34.913
What's this all about?

1:04:34.913 --> 1:04:37.292
- We have a lot to
talk about, Dad.

1:04:38.208 --> 1:04:40.712
(gentle music)

1:04:51.180 --> 1:04:53.975
- Think Mom and Dad will
wonder what happened to us?

1:04:55.183 --> 1:04:56.768
- They probably think
we're staying at Ray's.

1:04:56.768 --> 1:04:57.687
- Dang.

1:04:57.687 --> 1:04:59.313
We could get away with anything.

1:05:00.188 --> 1:05:01.023
- Yeah.

1:05:01.023 --> 1:05:03.733
(gentle music)

1:05:18.165 --> 1:05:19.167
- What's the matter?

1:05:20.125 --> 1:05:21.752
- I think this is yours.

1:05:22.628 --> 1:05:24.505
G double E.

1:05:24.505 --> 1:05:26.757
I don't know anyone
else with that nickname.

1:05:27.717 --> 1:05:30.093
You didn't tell me
I had a grandmother.

1:05:30.093 --> 1:05:31.387
Would've been nice if
I could've known her

1:05:31.387 --> 1:05:33.138
for more than the
last few hours.

1:05:35.808 --> 1:05:38.643
You told me my
grandparents were dead.

1:05:38.643 --> 1:05:40.395
- It was mostly true.

1:05:40.395 --> 1:05:43.023
Your mom's folks died
before you were born.

1:05:43.023 --> 1:05:44.525
- So why didn't you--

1:05:44.525 --> 1:05:46.318
- I took you up there
once, all right.

1:05:46.318 --> 1:05:48.028
You were just a baby.

1:05:48.028 --> 1:05:51.240
She held you and told me
never to bring you back.

1:05:51.240 --> 1:05:52.825
- Why?

1:05:52.825 --> 1:05:55.870
- Because that's what she's
been doing for 40 years.

1:05:55.870 --> 1:05:56.953
Turning everybody away.

1:05:56.953 --> 1:05:58.872
Telling them how my father died.

1:05:58.872 --> 1:05:59.915
- You never told me.

1:06:01.458 --> 1:06:02.793
- Why would you care?

1:06:02.793 --> 1:06:04.212
- Because I want to know.

1:06:05.713 --> 1:06:06.713
I would've listened.

1:06:08.048 --> 1:06:10.467
- I didn't just
keep it from you.

1:06:10.467 --> 1:06:13.137
I never told another living
soul what happened in that mine.

1:06:13.137 --> 1:06:14.763
(dramatic music)

1:06:14.763 --> 1:06:16.348
I was scared.

1:06:16.348 --> 1:06:19.602
More scared than I've
ever been before or since.

1:06:19.602 --> 1:06:22.312
(dramatic music)

1:06:23.938 --> 1:06:26.858
I took the wrong
tunnel on purpose.

1:06:27.818 --> 1:06:29.487
I didn't know what
was down there,

1:06:29.487 --> 1:06:30.738
but if we didn't find anything,

1:06:30.738 --> 1:06:33.490
I thought we could
give up and go home.

1:06:33.490 --> 1:06:36.160
(dramatic music)

1:06:52.175 --> 1:06:53.968
Shaft went down 800 feet.

1:06:55.553 --> 1:06:56.972
They found him under
10 feet of debris

1:06:56.972 --> 1:06:58.723
knocked loose on his way down.

1:07:00.017 --> 1:07:01.768
- It wasn't your fault.

1:07:01.768 --> 1:07:05.063
(dramatic music)

1:07:05.063 --> 1:07:06.357
- I'm in trouble, Fairly.

1:07:07.525 --> 1:07:09.318
That last subdivision.

1:07:09.318 --> 1:07:11.028
There's no investment for it.

1:07:11.028 --> 1:07:12.278
No one to pay for it.

1:07:14.323 --> 1:07:16.825
But I know something that I can.

1:07:16.825 --> 1:07:18.368
- The treasure.

1:07:18.368 --> 1:07:19.870
Why do you want it?

1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:22.748
- Why do I want it?

1:07:22.748 --> 1:07:24.833
Why did my father want it?

1:07:24.833 --> 1:07:27.920
Why did those people that
died in that mine want it?

1:07:27.920 --> 1:07:29.172
But I have a purpose for it.

1:07:30.713 --> 1:07:33.050
We could have a beautiful city
down there like Sacramento.

1:07:33.050 --> 1:07:35.845
Built on mine tailings
and failed farms,

1:07:35.845 --> 1:07:38.805
but only if I could get
that one final piece.

1:07:38.805 --> 1:07:40.723
- Dad, let's just go.

1:07:41.642 --> 1:07:42.977
I mean it.

1:07:42.977 --> 1:07:44.728
I'll get Rachel and we'll go.

1:07:44.728 --> 1:07:45.645
I don't want it.

1:07:45.645 --> 1:07:47.105
I don't need it.

1:07:47.105 --> 1:07:49.150
Let's just leave it.

1:07:49.150 --> 1:07:50.818
- Hold it, dork boy.

1:07:50.818 --> 1:07:52.570
You're not trading
away my share.

1:07:52.570 --> 1:07:53.362
- Forget it.

1:07:53.362 --> 1:07:54.238
Let's just go.

1:07:54.238 --> 1:07:55.447
- We're taking it.

1:07:55.447 --> 1:07:56.698
- I want to go.

1:07:56.698 --> 1:07:57.825
- Then go.

1:07:57.825 --> 1:08:00.285
(gentle music)

1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:03.747
- You're not stopping us.

1:08:05.040 --> 1:08:07.502
(gentle music)

1:08:17.093 --> 1:08:18.553
Hey.

1:08:18.553 --> 1:08:19.472
That's mine.

1:08:21.973 --> 1:08:24.185
- So far Rachel has been
dropped off a cliff,

1:08:24.185 --> 1:08:26.312
thrown down a mine
shaft, and blown to hell

1:08:26.312 --> 1:08:28.688
all so you could
have your share.

1:08:28.688 --> 1:08:30.900
The least you can do is
give her a warm place

1:08:30.900 --> 1:08:32.943
to sleep for one night.

1:08:32.943 --> 1:08:35.653
(gentle music)

1:08:40.575 --> 1:08:42.452
- We'll be back for
it in the morning.

1:08:45.832 --> 1:08:48.333
(gentle music)

1:09:07.895 --> 1:09:08.978
- Fairly.

1:09:11.273 --> 1:09:15.568
- Riley, Colton, and my dad
are camped down the mountain.

1:09:16.820 --> 1:09:19.657
They are coming for the
treasure in the morning.

1:09:21.242 --> 1:09:22.910
- How'd they find us?

1:09:22.910 --> 1:09:24.160
- They've been following us.

1:09:24.995 --> 1:09:26.622
This is a two way radio.

1:09:27.873 --> 1:09:31.043
Dad's been using it
to keep tabs on us.

1:09:31.043 --> 1:09:32.293
- And you were in on it?

1:09:33.420 --> 1:09:34.213
- Yeah.

1:09:35.172 --> 1:09:35.965
- Why?

1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:39.760
- I didn't want to.

1:09:41.678 --> 1:09:43.388
- That's what you
said the last time.

1:09:43.388 --> 1:09:46.517
- Seems to be the only way
I ever get what I want.

1:09:46.517 --> 1:09:48.935
I never got to go on
a hike in California.

1:09:48.935 --> 1:09:51.313
Not even with the Boy's Scouts.

1:09:51.313 --> 1:09:54.650
I never thought Dad would
let me go on this trip,

1:09:54.650 --> 1:09:57.402
but he said I could go if
I took the stupid radio

1:09:57.402 --> 1:09:59.028
and kept him posted.

1:09:59.028 --> 1:10:02.115
- And you thought you could
be a nice little double agent.

1:10:02.115 --> 1:10:04.033
- I never thought
we'd find anything.

1:10:05.452 --> 1:10:09.415
All I cared about was I finally
got to do what I wanted.

1:10:11.125 --> 1:10:12.793
With you.

1:10:12.793 --> 1:10:14.462
- You're just a stooge for them.

1:10:14.462 --> 1:10:16.130
You always were.

1:10:16.130 --> 1:10:16.922
- No.

1:10:16.922 --> 1:10:17.882
- Liar.

1:10:17.882 --> 1:10:18.882
We found it.

1:10:18.882 --> 1:10:20.175
It's ours.

1:10:20.175 --> 1:10:22.552
And you're just gonna
let them have it.

1:10:22.552 --> 1:10:24.347
You're not letting them
steal from just me.

1:10:24.347 --> 1:10:25.973
They're stealing
from you as well.

1:10:25.973 --> 1:10:28.808
Can't you see what
they're doing?

1:10:28.808 --> 1:10:31.312
(gentle music)

1:10:35.315 --> 1:10:37.067
I was hoping.

1:10:39.193 --> 1:10:44.198
I thought I could do
something for my folks.

1:10:45.117 --> 1:10:46.952
One last little thing.

1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:49.497
Right when it counted.

1:10:51.165 --> 1:10:52.040
You don't care.

1:10:53.167 --> 1:10:54.208
You'll just take it away.

1:10:55.252 --> 1:10:57.963
(gentle music)

1:11:07.180 --> 1:11:10.100
- I know how we can get
the treasure past them.

1:11:10.100 --> 1:11:10.850
- How?

1:11:11.727 --> 1:11:13.645
We can't carry it.

1:11:13.645 --> 1:11:14.813
We can't hide it.

1:11:15.647 --> 1:11:18.108
(gentle music)

1:11:28.035 --> 1:11:30.745
(bright music)

1:11:44.677 --> 1:11:48.180
- Dad, you might wanna
stay off the tracks.

1:11:48.180 --> 1:11:50.682
Riley, Colton.

1:11:50.682 --> 1:11:51.892
You too.

1:11:51.892 --> 1:11:53.227
- [Riley] Maybe we should just

1:11:53.227 --> 1:11:56.022
leave tire tracks
across your butt.

1:11:56.022 --> 1:11:58.107
(bright music)

1:11:58.107 --> 1:11:58.898
That got him.

1:11:58.898 --> 1:11:59.650
That got him.

1:12:00.567 --> 1:12:05.488
(bright music)
(bikes whirring)

1:12:07.950 --> 1:12:10.618
(dramatic music)

1:12:15.832 --> 1:12:16.833
- [Boys] Ah.

1:12:18.085 --> 1:12:19.127
- Woo.

1:12:26.008 --> 1:12:27.510
- Where the heck
did they get that?

1:12:27.510 --> 1:12:29.053
- [Riley] They are dead.

1:12:29.053 --> 1:12:30.055
They are so dead.

1:12:33.142 --> 1:12:34.183
- Riley, wait.

1:12:35.477 --> 1:12:38.188
Riley, I know how
we can stop them.

1:12:38.188 --> 1:12:39.773
(dramatic music)

1:12:39.773 --> 1:12:40.648
- [Riley] Colton.

1:12:40.648 --> 1:12:42.650
We're grabbing the ball.

1:12:42.650 --> 1:12:43.443
Colton.

1:12:44.403 --> 1:12:49.408
(dramatic music)
(bikes whirring)

1:12:55.830 --> 1:12:56.748
- [Fairly] How's
it going up there?

1:12:56.748 --> 1:12:58.917
- This is crazy, you know that?

1:12:58.917 --> 1:13:00.210
I haven't had to work
on anything like this

1:13:00.210 --> 1:13:02.670
since I had to fix
the shop compressor.

1:13:02.670 --> 1:13:04.338
- Well if anybody could do it.

1:13:04.338 --> 1:13:09.302
(dramatic music)
(bikes whirring)

1:13:15.725 --> 1:13:16.810
- [Riley] Whoa.

1:13:16.810 --> 1:13:17.602
Holy.

1:13:18.770 --> 1:13:19.855
- Yeah.

1:13:19.855 --> 1:13:22.357
(gentle music)

1:13:32.158 --> 1:13:37.163
(dramatic music)
(bike whirring)

1:13:38.998 --> 1:13:40.500
- Colton, wait.

1:13:40.500 --> 1:13:41.627
I need that quad.

1:13:42.710 --> 1:13:44.003
I said wait.

1:13:44.003 --> 1:13:44.963
What do you think
you're gonna do?

1:13:44.963 --> 1:13:46.005
- I'm gonna cut them off.

1:13:46.005 --> 1:13:47.340
- With that?

1:13:47.340 --> 1:13:49.300
They'll knock you out of
the way like a pinball.

1:13:50.968 --> 1:13:52.178
- [Riley] Yeah, don't move.

1:13:52.178 --> 1:13:53.138
We got 'em.

1:13:53.138 --> 1:13:54.682
- Don't slow down.

1:13:54.682 --> 1:13:56.808
- If we hit him, we'll explode.

1:13:56.808 --> 1:13:58.643
- Listen, they're on tracks.

1:13:58.643 --> 1:14:00.728
We can stop them
further down the road.

1:14:00.728 --> 1:14:01.522
I know where.

1:14:01.522 --> 1:14:02.355
- But Riley says--

1:14:02.355 --> 1:14:03.690
- Forget Riley.

1:14:03.690 --> 1:14:05.275
He's a jerk and an egomaniac.

1:14:05.275 --> 1:14:07.027
He doesn't know what he's doing,

1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:11.990
but if you stop him, you can
lord it over him forever.

1:14:13.242 --> 1:14:14.660
- What do we do?

1:14:14.660 --> 1:14:15.868
- Straight down the slope
just like you were doing.

1:14:15.868 --> 1:14:16.662
Come on.

1:14:16.662 --> 1:14:19.163
(dramatic music)

1:14:19.163 --> 1:14:21.292
- [Riley] No, you traitors.

1:14:21.292 --> 1:14:23.377
- [Fairly] So long, sucker.

1:14:23.377 --> 1:14:25.170
- [Riley] So long, my butt.

1:14:25.170 --> 1:14:29.090
(bike whirring)
(gentle music)

1:14:29.090 --> 1:14:30.258
Ah.

1:14:30.258 --> 1:14:31.343
Foul.

1:14:31.343 --> 1:14:36.348
(gentle music)
(bike whirring)

1:14:41.562 --> 1:14:43.355
(bike exploding)

1:14:43.355 --> 1:14:44.397
No.

1:14:47.067 --> 1:14:49.235
You're going down.

1:14:49.235 --> 1:14:51.905
(dramatic music)

1:15:08.880 --> 1:15:11.090
Hold on tight.

1:15:11.090 --> 1:15:12.342
- Stop it, you'll kill him.

1:15:14.010 --> 1:15:16.388
- [Riley] Oh no, ladies first.

1:15:17.555 --> 1:15:19.057
- You've done enough.

1:15:19.057 --> 1:15:20.350
- [Riley] Let go, stupid.

1:15:22.435 --> 1:15:23.353
Let go.

1:15:23.353 --> 1:15:26.315
(dramatic music)

1:15:29.610 --> 1:15:31.487
There, I told you.

1:15:31.487 --> 1:15:32.778
I told you.

1:15:32.778 --> 1:15:34.322
Now.

1:15:34.322 --> 1:15:36.492
Don't play with me, Miss Rachel.

1:15:36.492 --> 1:15:37.867
Don't play with me.

1:15:37.867 --> 1:15:39.493
I'm telling you stop.

1:15:42.455 --> 1:15:43.582
Told you.

1:15:43.582 --> 1:15:44.667
Told you.

1:15:44.667 --> 1:15:46.293
I told you.

1:15:46.293 --> 1:15:49.087
Now we're gonna see why the
tough chick kept running away.

1:15:51.507 --> 1:15:53.092
- I was being kind.

1:15:58.888 --> 1:16:00.682
- [Riley] No, wait.

1:16:00.682 --> 1:16:02.350
Please, don't.

1:16:02.350 --> 1:16:03.143
Don't.

1:16:03.143 --> 1:16:04.268
Please, please.

1:16:04.268 --> 1:16:05.645
The bridge.

1:16:06.688 --> 1:16:07.772
The bridge.

1:16:07.772 --> 1:16:10.442
(dramatic music)

1:16:16.490 --> 1:16:19.492
(suspenseful music)

1:16:22.370 --> 1:16:25.415
(tires squealing)

1:16:39.805 --> 1:16:40.597
- Look out.

1:16:40.597 --> 1:16:41.390
Coming through.

1:16:49.522 --> 1:16:50.732
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:16:50.732 --> 1:16:51.525
I'm sorry.

1:16:52.525 --> 1:16:53.568
Whoa.

1:17:05.580 --> 1:17:08.042
(bright music)

1:17:16.925 --> 1:17:18.343
- Keep back.

1:17:18.343 --> 1:17:19.385
Just keep back.

1:17:25.683 --> 1:17:27.227
- Rachel.

1:17:27.227 --> 1:17:29.897
(dramatic music)

1:17:38.405 --> 1:17:41.198
(train exploding)

1:17:42.117 --> 1:17:44.787
(dramatic music)

1:18:03.888 --> 1:18:04.680
Rachel.

1:18:10.645 --> 1:18:11.647
Last rope.

1:18:11.647 --> 1:18:12.397
Make it count.

1:18:40.425 --> 1:18:41.510
- I can't.

1:18:41.510 --> 1:18:44.053
I can't believe I just did that

1:18:44.053 --> 1:18:45.805
after all we went
through to get it.

1:18:46.973 --> 1:18:49.558
- You just gave it
back to the mountain.

1:18:49.558 --> 1:18:51.060
No one else would have the guts.

1:18:52.062 --> 1:18:52.853
- Fairly.

1:18:53.730 --> 1:18:55.107
Wait for us, will you?

1:18:57.608 --> 1:18:59.568
- See you at home, Dad.

1:18:59.568 --> 1:19:00.612
Here, let me help you up.

1:19:02.530 --> 1:19:03.823
- [Mary] Have you
heard anything?

1:19:03.823 --> 1:19:05.492
I need someone to be out
there looking for my daughter.

1:19:05.492 --> 1:19:06.702
She's been gone.

1:19:07.952 --> 1:19:11.122
You are the fifth person
I have spoken with.

1:19:11.122 --> 1:19:12.165
I'm not get.

1:19:13.542 --> 1:19:16.377
What do you mean a
forest service problem?

1:19:16.377 --> 1:19:18.338
They said I needed
to talk to you.

1:19:31.142 --> 1:19:33.645
(gentle music)

1:19:47.950 --> 1:19:49.077
- Grandpa.

1:19:49.077 --> 1:19:50.537
- Rachel.

1:19:50.537 --> 1:19:52.413
Rachel, get down here now.

1:19:52.413 --> 1:19:54.123
- Grandpa, I'm so sorry.

1:19:54.123 --> 1:19:56.793
We got stuck in the dark and
my cellphone wasn't working.

1:19:56.793 --> 1:19:58.462
- No, no, no, no, look at this.

1:19:58.462 --> 1:19:59.963
Look, look, look.

1:19:59.963 --> 1:20:00.880
I found it.

1:20:00.880 --> 1:20:02.423
The biggest strike of my life.

1:20:02.423 --> 1:20:03.175
Yahoo (laughs).

1:20:05.635 --> 1:20:06.720
I knew it was there.

1:20:06.720 --> 1:20:08.597
It took years but I knew it.

1:20:08.597 --> 1:20:09.722
Millions.

1:20:09.722 --> 1:20:11.348
Now what are you waiting for?

1:20:11.348 --> 1:20:12.683
Go get the land rover.

1:20:12.683 --> 1:20:14.268
We're gonna need it to
get all this out of here.

1:20:14.268 --> 1:20:16.772
(gentle music)

1:20:21.735 --> 1:20:22.985
Look, look.

1:20:22.985 --> 1:20:24.988
(gentle music)

1:20:24.988 --> 1:20:25.822
Another strike.

1:20:25.822 --> 1:20:26.740
I made it.

1:20:26.740 --> 1:20:27.657
I made it.

1:20:27.657 --> 1:20:28.700
Millions.

1:20:28.700 --> 1:20:29.575
Just look at it.

1:20:30.618 --> 1:20:31.537
- [Sanders] That's my gold.

1:20:31.537 --> 1:20:33.580
- Your gold?

1:20:33.580 --> 1:20:35.873
You don't own my place yet.

1:20:35.873 --> 1:20:37.125
Take it.

1:20:37.125 --> 1:20:38.668
Take it and do your
worst (laughs).

1:20:42.338 --> 1:20:43.715
- What happened?

1:20:43.715 --> 1:20:45.217
- Long story.

1:20:45.217 --> 1:20:46.885
- We'll hear all
about that later.

1:20:46.885 --> 1:20:48.637
This calls for a celebration.

1:20:50.055 --> 1:20:51.723
You wanna come?

1:20:51.723 --> 1:20:53.350
You're welcome to.

1:20:53.350 --> 1:20:55.768
(gentle music)

1:21:13.912 --> 1:21:15.455
- Where are the other two?

1:21:15.455 --> 1:21:17.123
- Fed 'em to the wolves.

1:21:17.123 --> 1:21:18.667
- Really?

1:21:18.667 --> 1:21:20.168
- No, but I should have.

1:21:22.212 --> 1:21:23.212
- Are you coming in?

1:21:25.590 --> 1:21:27.925
- I don't think I'd
be the guest of honor.

1:21:27.925 --> 1:21:30.720
- Still you ought
to just because.

1:21:33.723 --> 1:21:34.848
- You go ahead.

1:21:34.848 --> 1:21:36.685
I'll be along in a minute.

1:21:36.685 --> 1:21:39.187
(gentle music)
