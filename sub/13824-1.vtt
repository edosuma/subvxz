03:38.301 --> 03:40.970
There's a tiger on the loose.
Tiger!

05:02.176 --> 05:04.178
Ah! Tiger on the loose.

06:27.845 --> 06:32.350
Let's hear it for our two
heroes who captured the loose tiger:

06:32.350 --> 06:33.684
Tom and Jerry.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.938
Please accept these
solid-gold medals...

06:36.938 --> 06:40.274
...as symbols of your bravery
from His Honor, the mayor.

06:43.694 --> 06:46.322
Congratulations, Tom...

06:46.322 --> 06:47.782
...and Jerry.

06:55.164 --> 06:59.669
Hey, everybody.
That ain't no tiger. It's a capybara.

06:59.669 --> 07:03.589
Oh, and I was having
so much fun too.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.424
But how?

07:16.018 --> 07:17.145
Freaks.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.938
Impostors.
Charlatans.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.566
Hold everything.
Stop!

07:21.566 --> 07:24.902
If the capybara isn't the tiger...

07:24.902 --> 07:27.697
...then where is the tiger?

07:43.963 --> 07:45.965
Tiger!
Tiger on the loose.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.551
Help! This is the tiger.

08:28.382 --> 08:29.717
Mm-hm?

08:31.552 --> 08:34.847
What's the big idea?
You goofing off again?

08:34.847 --> 08:40.228
You're supposed to be keeping an eye on
the visitors so nobody feeds the animals.

08:40.228 --> 08:44.440
That is my distinct,
honored privilege as a member of...

08:44.440 --> 08:49.111
...the Amalgamated Association
of Zookeepers of Earth.

08:50.029 --> 08:54.283
How hard can it be
to enforce one simple rule?

08:54.283 --> 08:56.619
Do not...

08:56.619 --> 08:57.828
...feed...

08:57.828 --> 08:59.872
...the animals.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.290
You got that?

09:01.290 --> 09:03.709
Nobody feeds these animals but me.

09:04.543 --> 09:10.633
And I give them this special stuff
whether they like it or not. Got that?

09:10.633 --> 09:12.969
Now, don't let me
have to tell you again.

09:12.969 --> 09:16.722
One more slip-up, goofball,
and I'll have your badge.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.891
I've got my eye on youse.

09:19.684 --> 09:22.144
Now, get out there.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.813
And enjoy yourself.

09:38.744 --> 09:42.039
No, sir.
Nobody feeds the animals, nohow.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.199
Huh?

11:12.004 --> 11:13.297
Hmph.

12:00.428 --> 12:04.473
What's this?
Something else that ain't on the menu?

12:04.473 --> 12:08.727
What did I tell you?
No feeding the animals!

13:35.314 --> 13:36.774
Whew.

14:56.478 --> 14:59.356
How many times do I gotta tell you?

14:59.356 --> 15:02.276
Don't feed the animals.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.455
Good boy.

16:03.587 --> 16:05.381
Mush, little doggy.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.049
Mush, mush.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.651
Oh, my poor tail.

17:40.601 --> 17:41.769
Yello?

19:26.206 --> 19:28.083
Okay, call it.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.585
Tails.

21:22.322 --> 21:26.159
I got you.
Let me have him.
