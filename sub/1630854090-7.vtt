WEBVTT

00:08.083 --> 00:09.833
The intel was solid.

00:09.916 --> 00:11.166
<i>Not arguing with that,</i>

00:11.250 --> 00:14.166
but it is possible
somebody tipped the Blood Witches off.

00:15.583 --> 00:16.708
Still no sign of Bloom?

00:16.791 --> 00:20.333
No, and our power shorted out
a few minutes ago.

00:20.416 --> 00:24.750
<i>It's either a distraction to get her out</i>
<i>or she's somewhere losing control.</i>

00:24.833 --> 00:27.000
Bloom is not dangerous. Trust me.

00:27.083 --> 00:28.666
Don't be too sure.

00:57.041 --> 01:00.125
Let's just hope Bavani hasn't come
and checked up on us.

01:03.166 --> 01:04.666
I have magic. You don't.

01:21.833 --> 01:23.541
[unsettling music continues[

01:34.625 --> 01:35.458
Hello?

01:44.833 --> 01:45.666
Are you all alone?

01:47.416 --> 01:48.375
No fiery friend?

01:49.791 --> 01:50.875
Check the hall.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.291
Anyone?

01:58.291 --> 02:02.291
No. Looks like the little flower girl
is all alone.

02:02.375 --> 02:03.916
Hmm. Good.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.375
Go.

02:18.916 --> 02:21.375
The attack was over in about 20 minutes.

02:21.458 --> 02:23.083
I don't know how many Blood Witches,

02:23.166 --> 02:25.708
but enough to take over
every Specialist there.

02:25.791 --> 02:27.833
They knew we were making a move
on their hideout.

02:27.916 --> 02:31.291
And we drank the last
of the Blood Witch antidote. Fucker.

02:31.375 --> 02:33.000
They took over every Specialist?

02:33.083 --> 02:35.500
Mm-hmm. And fairies
didn't have it much better.

02:35.583 --> 02:38.541
Sebastian basically brought
an army of scrapers to take them down.

02:39.041 --> 02:40.333
Are they all drained?

02:40.416 --> 02:41.416
Not yet.

02:42.458 --> 02:45.458
They're being held under the school,
taken to him one by one.

02:45.541 --> 02:46.625
That's Bavani.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.333
We're thinking that he can't handle
a lot of magic at once.

02:49.416 --> 02:53.125
So there's still time to save some
of them. That's good. Good intel.

02:53.208 --> 02:55.708
Well, it's all Musa.
She's hiding in the school.

02:55.791 --> 02:58.708
She was able to avoid detection,
but Flora wasn't so lucky.

02:58.791 --> 03:01.166
It looks like
we've got our work cut out for us.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.416
A frontal assault is suicide.

03:03.500 --> 03:06.458
A covert strike upgrades our odds,
but not by much.

03:06.541 --> 03:09.500
And we'll be fighting friends,
which is a headfuck.

03:10.041 --> 03:12.333
We've got non-lethal weapons
should you want them.

03:12.916 --> 03:16.750
Once we neutralize the threat,
the Blood Witches will be easy to clear.

03:17.791 --> 03:20.333
-Then we free the fairies.
-I'm go after Sebastian.

03:20.916 --> 03:21.791
Let's gear up.

03:22.291 --> 03:25.458
-Bloom, walk with me.

03:41.875 --> 03:45.000
<i> Be careful.</i>
<i>They're still people.</i>

03:45.875 --> 03:48.750
It was bad enough he's a Blood Witch,
but working for Sebastian?

03:48.833 --> 03:51.583
I can't get my head around it.
There must be a reason for it.

03:52.083 --> 03:54.125
Maybe Sebastian's just really persuasive.

03:54.208 --> 03:57.458
Or maybe the people we care about
are just really shitty people.

03:59.875 --> 04:02.375
I know we can't go in there
'cause of the scrapers,

04:02.458 --> 04:05.583
but I don't know how long
I can sit around while Flora's trapped.

04:05.666 --> 04:08.625
Are you sure you're up for doing this?
It's okay to say no.

04:08.708 --> 04:10.500
I mean, is it though?

04:11.625 --> 04:12.833
Even before he broke in,

04:12.916 --> 04:15.125
I was the only one
powerful enough to stop him.

04:18.916 --> 04:20.333
He wants the Dragon Flame.

04:21.958 --> 04:25.458
He said if I gave it to him, he wouldn't
have to steal magic from fairies.

04:25.541 --> 04:27.708
Yes, but then he'd have the Dragon Flame.

04:29.625 --> 04:32.500
He's done all this without it.
Imagine what he could do with it.

04:33.708 --> 04:36.208
If anyone should have that power,
it should be you.

04:37.708 --> 04:38.708
I know.

04:40.291 --> 04:41.375
I have to fight.

04:41.458 --> 04:42.791
<i>We</i> have to fight.

04:48.208 --> 04:51.125
I haven't seen Sky. Who did he ride with?

04:51.833 --> 04:54.041
When you were in stasis,
he tried to get you out.

04:54.125 --> 04:57.666
-He landed himself in confinement.
-Wait. Is he still in the school?

04:57.750 --> 05:00.791
Yes, but before you go nuclear,
Sky is resourceful.

05:00.875 --> 05:02.500
<i>Trust me. He'll be fine.</i>

05:33.166 --> 05:35.208
<i>We can't just do nothing</i>
<i>while you go in there</i>

05:35.291 --> 05:37.208
and take on Sebastian all by yourself.

05:37.291 --> 05:40.333
-It's Silva's plan, not mine.
-What if you set someone on fire?

05:40.416 --> 05:42.250
If I was there, I could put them out.

05:42.333 --> 05:45.333
Well, I'll be in the graveyard,
waiting for everyone to clear out.

05:45.416 --> 05:46.500
You'll need a medic.

05:46.583 --> 05:48.416
Riven's gonna handle battlefield triage.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.583
Anybody badly injured
will come back here for you to treat them.

05:51.666 --> 05:54.500
Okay, I'll make you invisible
so you can sneak inside.

05:54.583 --> 05:57.166
-While scrapers steal your magic?
-They won't steal yours?

05:57.250 --> 05:59.500
No, I'll be transforming.
I'll be faster and stronger.

05:59.583 --> 06:03.166
Dowling taught us all how to transform.
We draw on all of our emotions.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.458
-Positive and negative.
-And have you?

06:06.041 --> 06:07.000
Any of you?

06:07.083 --> 06:09.000
We haven't tried. We can try.

06:09.083 --> 06:10.791
You think we have time right now?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.416
-You don't have to do this alone.
-Yes, I do.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.916
-'Cause none of you have this.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.208
The only thing
that will take Sebastian down.

06:20.291 --> 06:22.000
I'm the only one who has it.

06:22.500 --> 06:25.208
Look, I love you all. I do. I just, I…

06:27.208 --> 06:28.791
-Are you okay?
-Bloom?

06:40.125 --> 06:41.625
-What happened?
-She passed out.

06:41.708 --> 06:43.833
I think I probably just…
I need some water.

06:44.750 --> 06:47.833
Let's get her up.
Up you get.

06:48.833 --> 06:49.666
Sit down.

06:50.708 --> 06:52.083
I'm fine. I'm ready to go.

06:52.166 --> 06:54.125
-Are you sure?
-Yes. Mm-hmm.

06:56.041 --> 06:59.875
We won't need you until we clear
the controlled Specialists, so sit tight.

06:59.958 --> 07:01.166
-Yeah.
-Okay.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.625
Sorry to interrupt
whatever this is,

07:15.708 --> 07:18.375
but at the risk of being
a dead curious cat,

07:18.458 --> 07:20.583
what exactly is your endgame here?

07:21.333 --> 07:24.083
I think we both know
those answers weren't part of the deal.

07:24.833 --> 07:26.125
Fair enough.

07:26.208 --> 07:29.291
However, if we're taking
the deal literally, my part is over.

07:29.791 --> 07:33.375
You have the school. You have the fairies.
You have everything you want.

07:40.166 --> 07:42.041
Now you have everything you want.

07:42.833 --> 07:43.833
Anything else?

07:47.666 --> 07:49.750
-Keep looking for our leverage.
-Understood.

07:49.833 --> 07:53.416
I'm going to the Sanctum.
Give me 20 minutes, then bring another.

08:13.625 --> 08:16.791
They haven't taken anyone in a while.
Maybe it's over.

08:17.333 --> 08:19.208
It's not. Just sit tight.

08:19.291 --> 08:21.416
And wait to get plucked out like lobsters?

08:21.500 --> 08:24.750
I'm not dying to be food either.
We can't afford to do anything stupid.

08:26.541 --> 08:27.791
My friends will come.

08:30.041 --> 08:31.291
I'm going.

08:31.375 --> 08:34.541
Just don't use your magic.
I think scrapers can sense--

08:34.625 --> 08:38.000
-Yeah, I've got it, but thanks.

08:41.333 --> 08:42.916
[footsteps receding[

08:44.708 --> 08:46.583
See? There's nothing.

08:49.291 --> 08:50.208
Nick.

08:51.458 --> 08:53.041
Nick, come back into the light.

08:54.791 --> 08:56.416
Nick, don't be an idiot!

09:15.916 --> 09:18.666
The Blood Witches are using
controlled Specialists to patrol

09:18.750 --> 09:20.208
so they don't risk themselves.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.250
If word gets out we're making an attack,
we lose our advantage,

09:25.333 --> 09:27.750
so we'll spread out
and take them out one by one.

09:27.833 --> 09:28.958
Silently, all right?

09:29.625 --> 09:30.625
Let's move.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.666
<i>The Blood Witches know</i>
<i>about the attack.</i>

09:58.750 --> 09:59.791
<i> Are you sure?</i>

09:59.875 --> 10:01.125
Move out!

10:06.333 --> 10:09.208
No, but there are a ton
of Specialists headed outside.

10:09.291 --> 10:12.916
-Silva won't be able to break through.
-He has to, so I can go in.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
-You haven't seen Flora?
-No. I know where they've got her, but--

10:16.083 --> 10:20.458
No news is good news. There's still time.
If the Specialists fail, we break her out.

10:21.125 --> 10:23.166
What about Grey? One last appeal?

10:23.250 --> 10:26.541
You saw the video. You really think
he's interested in helping us?

10:27.666 --> 10:29.416
Look, I can try Beatrix again.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.041
<i>I think she left.</i>

10:32.541 --> 10:35.583
So basically Flora's screwed.
That's what everybody's saying.

10:35.666 --> 10:38.250
She's gonna lose her magic
and there's nothing we can do.

10:38.750 --> 10:40.583
No, not nothing.

10:41.083 --> 10:42.583
I'll text you later.

10:57.958 --> 11:01.750
I'm not one to diss art therapy,
but wanna share with the class?

11:04.375 --> 11:06.291
Earlier this morning, I didn't…

11:07.458 --> 11:09.541
I didn't pass out from exhaustion.

11:11.708 --> 11:14.041
When I summoned my Dragon Flame,
I saw, um…

11:15.041 --> 11:15.958
Sebastian.

11:17.166 --> 11:18.750
And I saw this.

11:19.625 --> 11:20.708
What is that?

11:21.208 --> 11:23.458
I don't know. Some kind of…

11:25.875 --> 11:27.458
vision or premonition.

11:28.708 --> 11:32.000
I know it definitely
had something to do with my magic, but--

11:32.083 --> 11:33.375
Hey, Bloom.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
It's okay.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.041
I just, I'm scared. I'm…

11:39.958 --> 11:41.791
just scared, Aisha. I mean, I'm…

11:42.458 --> 11:46.083
Ever since Rosalind, I'm just scared,
and I know I have to be strong, but--

11:46.166 --> 11:47.416
No, you don't.

11:48.041 --> 11:52.208
It doesn't make you any less of a badass
to let your friends take care of you.

11:52.833 --> 11:56.833
It's the toughest thing I've had to learn,
but after all this with Grey,

11:57.333 --> 11:58.750
if I didn't have you all…

12:01.541 --> 12:02.916
We are in this together.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Okay?

12:09.958 --> 12:12.083
Are you gonna be okay
to take out your man?

12:12.166 --> 12:13.791
No need. Texted him.

12:13.875 --> 12:16.791
What the fuck? Don't you understand
the words "surprise attack"?

12:16.875 --> 12:18.708
Oh, relax. He's a legend.

12:21.791 --> 12:22.791
Shit.

12:23.541 --> 12:25.333
-Watch out!

12:26.250 --> 12:27.250
It's me! It's Dane!

13:02.041 --> 13:04.333
-Thought you could use a hand.
-Fuck off.

13:04.416 --> 13:06.166
Let's hope he didn't tell anyone.

13:06.791 --> 13:08.083
They're down there!

13:08.750 --> 13:10.291
No such luck.

13:10.375 --> 13:12.625
We have to fall back. Oi. Now, now, now!

13:12.708 --> 13:13.708
Come on.

13:18.458 --> 13:21.291
Come on. You must have
some sort of weapon.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.125
Sebastian wants another one.

13:35.958 --> 13:38.375
I always hated
getting picked last.

13:44.875 --> 13:47.458
Sky, nice of you to join us.

13:48.666 --> 13:50.916
Yeah, I had to take care
of some delinquents.

13:55.208 --> 13:56.208
Nice sword.

13:58.458 --> 14:02.000
Closest thing I could find.
And it's, you know, not bad.

14:02.625 --> 14:04.750
Andreas said it was a bit unbalanced, but…

14:06.083 --> 14:08.625
It's not. It's old,
but it's not unbalanced.

14:08.708 --> 14:12.416
I think Andreas was just a bit jealous
because I gave you my father's sword

14:12.500 --> 14:13.958
and told you it was his.

14:19.583 --> 14:21.250
This is your father's sword.

14:26.375 --> 14:28.291
Right. Listen up.

14:29.500 --> 14:33.041
The Blood Witches were waiting for us,
so we've had to fall back.

14:33.541 --> 14:37.208
We're gonna stay here and regroup
until the Solarians come.

14:37.291 --> 14:39.750
But Musa's still in there. So's Flora.

14:39.833 --> 14:43.708
-Yeah, he's right, we should go now--
-It's not up for debate, okay?

14:43.791 --> 14:45.833
So let's keep busy until then. Move out.

14:50.625 --> 14:53.416
You need to get back
to the groundskeeper's house, now.

14:53.916 --> 14:55.500
What? I can fight. You know I can.

14:55.583 --> 14:59.125
Without LeRoy's antidote,
you are a sitting duck,

14:59.208 --> 15:02.250
<i>and the school</i>
<i>is crawling with Blood Witches.</i>

15:23.583 --> 15:24.416
Musa.

15:25.708 --> 15:28.708
Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

15:32.875 --> 15:34.416
Oh. Good skills.

15:36.166 --> 15:38.083
No bites. Still got your magic?

15:38.166 --> 15:40.625
I do. I think I can use that
to our advantage if--

15:40.708 --> 15:42.833
-Let's go!

15:55.166 --> 15:56.750
There you are. How are you?

15:56.833 --> 15:59.083
<i>I'm good.</i>
<i>Even better when I see you.</i>

16:00.375 --> 16:01.375
<i>How are you doing?</i>

16:02.208 --> 16:04.958
I mean, all things considered, I'm okay.

16:07.250 --> 16:09.166
Musa saved Flora from scrapers.

16:09.250 --> 16:10.541
<i>That's great.</i>

16:11.041 --> 16:13.125
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>except now they're stuck in there,</i>

16:13.666 --> 16:16.541
<i>so I… I guess we just have to wait</i>
<i>for the Solarians.</i>

16:17.083 --> 16:18.875
I feel like there's a "but" coming.

16:18.958 --> 16:22.333
No, I'm… I'm happy you're safe
and I'm happy Flora's safe. I just…

16:23.916 --> 16:25.875
I don't know. I feel like this isn't over.

16:26.416 --> 16:27.541
<i>'Cause it isn't.</i>

16:28.708 --> 16:30.666
<i>Sebastian's gonna get what he wants,</i>

16:31.708 --> 16:33.250
and you're gonna help him.

16:35.083 --> 16:36.083
<i>Sky?</i>

16:38.625 --> 16:39.625
<i>What's going on?</i>

16:40.958 --> 16:43.333
Go outside. Now.

16:46.958 --> 16:47.958
Sebastian.

16:49.041 --> 16:49.958
Quietly.

16:59.416 --> 17:02.041
-What do you want
-<i>Oh, I think you know.</i>

17:02.875 --> 17:05.625
<i>And by the way,</i>
<i>if you tell anyone, Sky dies.</i>

17:06.125 --> 17:09.250
<i>If anything happens to Grey, Sky dies.</i>

17:09.333 --> 17:12.333
If you try and fight me,
well, you get where I'm going.

17:16.125 --> 17:17.291
Drop your phone.

17:18.333 --> 17:19.583
I'll see you soon.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.250
I won't pretend
I understand your plan completely,

17:43.333 --> 17:44.791
but I found these.

17:44.875 --> 17:47.458
Is there any other secret herb stash
that you know about?

17:47.541 --> 17:48.916
I don't know. Know who would?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.708
The person whose drawers
I rummaged through.

17:50.791 --> 17:52.541
Never mind. This is fine.

17:52.625 --> 17:56.000
Why so secretive? Terra knows
we're trying to take out the scrapers.

17:56.083 --> 17:59.083
-Why hide the details?
-I don't wanna distract them.

17:59.166 --> 18:00.333
Besides, I've got this.

18:01.125 --> 18:03.208
You know she's gonna
keep checking on you--

18:07.541 --> 18:09.041
Bloom and Sky are missing.

18:33.041 --> 18:34.041
Bloom?

18:35.625 --> 18:36.625
Bloom.

18:38.500 --> 18:39.500
Sky?

18:40.791 --> 18:42.875
If you two are out here
making out somewhere,

18:42.958 --> 18:44.083
I will absolutely…

18:46.166 --> 18:47.791
Relax. It's just me.

18:49.625 --> 18:50.625
Just you?

18:51.666 --> 18:52.541
The villain.

18:52.625 --> 18:55.583
Labels. Would the villain do this?

18:57.250 --> 19:00.166
I did some snooping.
Found out what Sebastian's planning.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.166
He's obsessed with righting
the wrongs of Aster Dell.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.000
He's found a way.

19:07.083 --> 19:10.375
There's an entity
in the Realm of Darkness. Shadow.

19:12.625 --> 19:14.083
It can raise the dead.

19:14.583 --> 19:17.750
Sebastian wants to bring
everyone from Aster Dell back to life.

19:17.833 --> 19:21.000
Thing is, last time it happened,
it nearly destroyed the Otherworld.

19:22.125 --> 19:24.583
Sebastian didn't read the fine print
or doesn't care.

19:25.375 --> 19:28.791
Uh, Bloom had a vision of some portal
when she used the Dragon Flame.

19:28.875 --> 19:30.666
A conduit to the Realm of Darkness.

19:30.750 --> 19:33.000
Sebastian needs the Dragon Flame
to open it.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.125
So whatever she does,
tell Bloom to sit tight.

19:39.208 --> 19:40.541
What is that look?

19:41.750 --> 19:42.750
Bloom's missing.

19:43.875 --> 19:44.833
Along with Sky.

19:44.916 --> 19:47.291
He wanted leverage.

19:47.375 --> 19:50.333
Sebastian's using Sky as leverage.
You have to stop her.

19:50.416 --> 19:51.250
If that's true--

19:51.333 --> 19:54.291
Are you fucking kidding?
Of course it is. You have to stop her.

19:54.375 --> 19:57.666
Once the conduit's open, the only way
to close it is from the other side.

19:58.333 --> 20:01.916
Sky’s life is not worth more
than every other life in the Otherworld.

20:03.250 --> 20:05.875
I'm trying to help you,
but you have to help yourself.

20:07.458 --> 20:09.958
You really think
you can play both sides, don't you?

20:11.458 --> 20:15.000
Save Musa, give us some intel,
and that'll make up for betraying Alfea?

20:16.333 --> 20:18.708
I told you I'd do
whatever it took to survive.

20:20.291 --> 20:21.291
Congratulations.

20:22.500 --> 20:23.500
You survived.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.791
I have two sisters.

20:30.416 --> 20:32.041
I didn't know that.

20:34.958 --> 20:38.916
I didn't know anything about my past,
so I made a deal.

20:40.250 --> 20:43.041
I'd help him if he told me
why I was at Aster Dell.

20:45.750 --> 20:50.000
He didn't know the full story,
but he knew I had two sisters.

20:52.833 --> 20:56.375
I have no one, Stella.
No one in the entire world.

20:59.791 --> 21:01.041
You had me.

21:06.291 --> 21:07.750
Now, if you'll excuse me,

21:09.000 --> 21:10.791
I have to search for my friends.

21:20.750 --> 21:24.666
-It's not too late to do the right thing.
What's that mean? "The right thing."

21:24.750 --> 21:26.750
You could have given him
the Dragon Flame weeks ago.

21:26.833 --> 21:29.750
-Who's to say that wasn't right?
-He's stealing magic from fairies.

21:29.833 --> 21:32.541
Fairies killed the Blood Witches
at Aster Dell.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.708
I had family there, Bloom.

21:36.083 --> 21:38.250
I'm just saying, this is complicated.

21:39.750 --> 21:42.250
Yeah, maybe. But one thing isn't.

21:42.333 --> 21:43.833
Aisha let you in.

21:45.291 --> 21:46.500
And you lied to her,

21:46.583 --> 21:49.000
so you don't get to be
on this moral high ground.

21:51.416 --> 21:55.250
-If Sebastian didn't have Sky right now--
-Luckily, I do have Sky.

21:57.833 --> 21:59.208
Why don't you wait outside?

22:04.208 --> 22:05.666
Where is he? I wanna see him.

22:17.708 --> 22:20.875
Bit over the top, I know,
but gets the point across.

22:20.958 --> 22:21.916
Uh, careful now.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.375
Okay. Okay, fine.

22:32.958 --> 22:34.750
Fine. You want the Dragon Flame?

22:35.625 --> 22:37.041
It's yours. You can have it.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.875
Need a scraper to feed on my magic?

22:40.958 --> 22:43.666
No, Dragon Flame would fry it in a second.

22:45.416 --> 22:47.458
Luckily, I found this.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.000
You know how these work, right?

22:50.791 --> 22:54.291
You channel the Dragon Flame into it
and I channel it into me.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.208
Once I have it,

22:57.208 --> 22:58.041
Sky goes free.

23:14.416 --> 23:16.375
The Solarians are on their way.

23:16.458 --> 23:19.375
Will they fight an ancient evil
because we're too scared?

23:19.458 --> 23:22.375
-If that's what we have to do.
-You can't be serious.

23:22.458 --> 23:24.666
We are outnumbered.

23:24.750 --> 23:26.125
I don't care.

23:27.958 --> 23:30.208
Bloom's inside risking everything
to save Sky.

23:30.833 --> 23:33.875
Musa's got no magic
and virtually no fighting ability,

23:33.958 --> 23:35.083
and she's still there.

23:35.166 --> 23:37.583
My cousin spent last night
surrounded by monsters.

23:37.666 --> 23:40.875
What's she doing?
Cooking up a plan to kill those monsters.

23:41.375 --> 23:42.791
These are my friends.

23:43.541 --> 23:45.250
They're our friends. They need us.

23:45.333 --> 23:47.916
So, no, I'm not gonna be waiting
for the Solarians.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.875
I'm not gonna wait outside my home
for somebody else to save it.

23:51.583 --> 23:53.250
This is what Dowling would want.

23:55.333 --> 23:57.583
All of us, Alfeans, fighting together.

24:05.125 --> 24:07.791
Who am I to argue with Farah, huh?

24:08.833 --> 24:11.875
No magic till we clear
the scrapers, all right?

24:14.125 --> 24:15.833
-Let's gear up!
-Yes!

24:19.166 --> 24:21.750
Hey, you hear that?
We're moving out.

24:23.125 --> 24:25.541
What if he wakes up
and alerts the Blood Witches?

24:26.041 --> 24:28.291
Or if he doesn't know where he is
and freaks out?

24:31.958 --> 24:35.166
Yeah, you're right.
You should probably stay with him.

24:35.250 --> 24:36.500
We'll be okay.

24:38.208 --> 24:39.583
-You ready to go?
-Yeah.

24:42.500 --> 24:43.500
Hi.

24:44.291 --> 24:48.416
That was one of the hottest things
I've ever seen, Ter.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.250
Oh. Really?

24:50.333 --> 24:54.000
Um. Well, I saw this really great TED talk
the other day about empowerment.

24:54.083 --> 24:56.791
Um, it… it lags a bit in the middle

24:56.875 --> 25:00.125
and it was in a really tiny room,
so it was more TED-Talk adjacent,

25:00.208 --> 25:02.208
but it made some really good points

25:02.291 --> 25:04.500
about endorphin production
during motivational speeches.

25:04.583 --> 25:06.708
I'm ruining it, aren't I?

25:08.458 --> 25:09.375
No.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.750
Time to go fuck shit up.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.458
-We're running out of time.
-I'm aware.

25:35.958 --> 25:38.916
That's the last of the solvent.
Do you know if there's more?

25:39.000 --> 25:41.791
I'll call Terra. She can help. I can't.

25:46.583 --> 25:49.000
Update? Can we go in?
Have you cleared out the scrapers?

25:49.083 --> 25:52.291
I need more clean solvent
to distill this formula I'm working on.

25:52.375 --> 25:53.458
I already used yours.

25:53.541 --> 25:56.375
<i>Tell me what you need it for.</i>
<i>What's your plan?</i>

25:58.041 --> 26:01.375
I'm distilling a pheromone of my magic
to track the scrapers to me.

26:02.791 --> 26:03.625
And then what?

26:05.083 --> 26:07.083
Eldwyn isn't just toxic to humans.

26:08.833 --> 26:10.333
Flora, n… no.

26:10.416 --> 26:13.250
There's solvent in the greenhouse.
I can always go there.

26:13.333 --> 26:16.000
I… I can't let you do this.

26:16.083 --> 26:18.000
<i>I can't let you sacrifice yourself.</i>

26:18.083 --> 26:19.750
This is my home now too, Terra.

26:20.500 --> 26:22.083
I'm not just gonna hide in here

26:22.166 --> 26:24.375
while you risk yourselves
and try to transform.

26:25.500 --> 26:28.791
I know this is a reckless Flora move,
but I know it'll work.

26:32.500 --> 26:33.500
Okay.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.625
Bloom's got some Gamsol oil
next to her paintbrushes.

26:37.708 --> 26:40.166
Uh, Stella's nail-polish remover
is high quality.

26:40.250 --> 26:43.125
Musa's got some WD-40
from trying to fix the water pressure.

26:43.208 --> 26:46.625
<i>If all else fails, Aisha's got</i>
<i>a stash of vodka in her bottom drawer.</i>

26:46.708 --> 26:48.041
One of those should work.

26:50.083 --> 26:51.541
I'm very observant.

26:51.625 --> 26:53.416
-Thank you, Terra.

27:12.625 --> 27:14.500
Sebastian. Sebastian.

27:16.041 --> 27:17.041
Please wait.

27:21.291 --> 27:23.541
-What?
-Specialists seen.

27:23.625 --> 27:25.375
Do something about it.

27:28.666 --> 27:31.083
Your friends are making
quite the rescue attempt.

27:32.833 --> 27:35.791
Did you expect them
to just wait around and do nothing?

27:35.875 --> 27:38.583
Course not. But I wonder
if they'd make the same effort

27:38.666 --> 27:41.208
if they knew how relieved you are
to be giving it up.

27:41.291 --> 27:44.791
-You think if I had a choice, I wouldn't--
-Don't be ashamed, Bloom.

27:47.125 --> 27:48.500
You're a teenager.

27:49.083 --> 27:51.416
You should be allowed to be a teenager.

27:52.541 --> 27:54.250
Spend time with your friends.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.208
With your boyfriend.

27:57.041 --> 27:59.750
I know what it's like
to miss out on all of that

27:59.833 --> 28:02.083
because you're dealing with shit
that's bigger than you.

28:02.166 --> 28:06.416
Nobody gets to have a normal life
when the Dragon Flame is involved,

28:06.500 --> 28:09.416
and a normal life
is all your mum ever wanted for you.

28:09.500 --> 28:10.708
Are you taunting me?

28:11.916 --> 28:14.250
You won. You're getting
everything you wanted--

28:14.333 --> 28:15.833
I didn't mean to taunt.

28:15.916 --> 28:17.875
-I didn't.
-So then tell me.

28:18.666 --> 28:20.458
Tell me about my mom, where I came from.

28:20.541 --> 28:22.750
-Stalling for time?
-You can read my thoughts.

28:22.833 --> 28:24.875
You really think I don't wanna know?

28:26.458 --> 28:28.625
It's not a happy story.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.500
Would have been
more of a surprise if it were.

28:35.875 --> 28:37.666
Your mum had the Dragon Flame.

28:40.500 --> 28:41.333
Just like you.

28:43.083 --> 28:45.250
I thought that only existed
1,000 years ago.

28:45.333 --> 28:47.291
No,
that's not technically true.

28:47.375 --> 28:50.375
It was just in stasis for 1,000 years.

28:53.666 --> 28:56.333
Because you were in stasis
for 1,000 years.

28:57.500 --> 28:58.625
As a baby.

29:01.583 --> 29:05.250
So, I was… I was born 1,000 ye… years ago?

29:07.625 --> 29:09.166
In the middle of an ancient war.

29:10.208 --> 29:11.250
That's…

29:11.333 --> 29:15.375
Your mum and the Dragon Flame
were the heroes of that war

29:16.125 --> 29:18.125
until she lost control

29:18.875 --> 29:20.083
and thousands died.

29:21.375 --> 29:24.000
She was wracked with guilt
for what she'd done,

29:24.750 --> 29:26.250
for passing the burden on to you.

29:26.333 --> 29:30.500
She couldn't fathom
you going down the same path,

29:30.583 --> 29:32.375
so, the day you were born,

29:33.458 --> 29:35.000
she put you in stasis

29:35.083 --> 29:37.708
and she put herself
in the Realm of Darkness.

29:40.625 --> 29:42.291
So my parents--

29:42.375 --> 29:44.208
Have been gone for a very long time.

29:49.416 --> 29:52.750
Your mum never wanted you
to have the burden of the Dragon Flame.

29:55.833 --> 29:57.541
Once you give it to me,

29:58.875 --> 30:01.708
you can finally live your life.

30:07.083 --> 30:08.083
Now…

30:11.625 --> 30:13.000
let's finish this.

30:19.916 --> 30:22.666
They're outnumbered.
They're fighting a losing battle.

30:29.041 --> 30:31.166
-We have to use our magic.
-No, not yet.

30:31.250 --> 30:34.916
Flora needs the scrapers focused on her.
That's the only way she'll destroy them.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.416
This should draw
all the scrapers to me.

30:37.500 --> 30:41.083
-How d'you know it's working?
-I don't. We just have to wait and…

30:41.166 --> 30:43.500
-Time for you to go. Now.

30:43.583 --> 30:47.000
-No! How're you gonna jab them all?
-I'm not jabbing them.

30:49.291 --> 30:50.416
Flora.

30:51.208 --> 30:52.833
When they feed on me, they'll die.

30:53.541 --> 30:56.083
There are still fairies out there
with magic. Free them.

30:56.583 --> 30:58.666
Let the suite know
we've cleared the field.

31:02.583 --> 31:03.958
Be honest. Does it hurt?

31:05.833 --> 31:06.833
Like hell.

31:08.875 --> 31:09.875
Go.

31:33.458 --> 31:36.333
Look. The fairies are free.
Flora's done it.

31:43.625 --> 31:44.708
Let's go.

31:44.791 --> 31:46.833
Keep going. We can do this!

31:51.083 --> 31:53.958
-Look at you, proving me wrong.
-Could still use pointers.

31:54.041 --> 31:55.916
-Watch your left.

32:03.125 --> 32:05.916
-We're going inside.
-I can't let you do that.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.541
My brother died in Aster Dell.

32:12.208 --> 32:13.458
Whatever your reasons--

32:13.541 --> 32:16.208
-I was my parents' replacement son.
-Stop.

32:17.333 --> 32:20.250
Sebastian told them
he could bring my brother back to life.

32:20.333 --> 32:21.458
I said stop.

32:24.250 --> 32:26.416
Aisha, I just wanna be free.

32:27.625 --> 32:30.916
From expectations,
from the Blood Witches, from everything,

32:31.000 --> 32:33.458
and if Sebastian
can bring him back, I can be.

32:35.750 --> 32:38.166
You of all people should understand that.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
You lied to me.

32:42.083 --> 32:44.916
If I told you I was a Blood Witch,
it would've been over.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.916
Months. We were together for months,
and every minute was a lie.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.375
Bullshit. I never lied about how I felt.

32:52.750 --> 32:54.291
-That was real.
-For you.

32:55.041 --> 32:56.333
It was real for you.

32:57.125 --> 32:58.750
Because you knew the truth.

32:59.333 --> 33:02.708
And now you get to have
those good memories. To keep them.

33:03.625 --> 33:05.000
But they are ruined for me.

33:07.333 --> 33:08.625
My first boyfriend.

33:09.541 --> 33:10.708
My first kiss.

33:13.166 --> 33:14.541
I hate that it was you.

33:22.750 --> 33:25.333
You'll have to live
with the choices you've made.

33:25.416 --> 33:26.833
We're going inside.

33:42.250 --> 33:44.625
Not long now, Bloom.
I can feel it.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.750
Hate to interrupt
a private moment.

33:50.250 --> 33:51.666
Not now, Beatrix.

33:51.750 --> 33:55.041
Bloom might want to know
what you plan to use the Dragon Flame for.

33:59.625 --> 34:01.250
Does it matter?

34:05.125 --> 34:07.875
Figured. Remember you said that.

34:11.541 --> 34:13.500
-Sky!
-No. No!

34:14.500 --> 34:15.750
No, Sky.

34:15.833 --> 34:16.833
Sky.

34:19.416 --> 34:20.250
No!

34:32.583 --> 34:34.625
Have you any fucking idea
what you've done?

34:35.666 --> 34:37.125
Yeah, I just saved the world.

34:38.833 --> 34:41.041
-Gotta admit, feels pretty good.

35:12.208 --> 35:14.750
This is exactly what happened
to your mum, Bloom,

35:15.250 --> 35:16.708
and people died.

35:17.291 --> 35:18.750
I don't care.

35:18.833 --> 35:23.166
Okay. So what are you gonna do? Kill me.
Then what? Destroy the school?

35:24.791 --> 35:27.291
Your friends are outside fighting for you.

35:30.375 --> 35:32.333
Technically, her friends are inside now.

35:34.041 --> 35:36.166
Bloom, look at me.

35:37.625 --> 35:39.583
You can stand down. We're here.

35:40.125 --> 35:42.208
Remember, you don't have
to do this alone.

35:42.291 --> 35:43.291
Leave.

35:44.416 --> 35:46.541
Get everyone as far away
from here as possible.

35:48.541 --> 35:49.666
Now!

35:50.708 --> 35:52.500
No, Bloom. We're not leaving you.

35:56.750 --> 35:58.416
His heart stopped.

35:58.500 --> 36:01.125
I can use Blood Witch magic
to pump the muscle around it.

36:01.208 --> 36:02.708
-I can keep him alive.
-Sky!

36:02.791 --> 36:04.333
The boy came through.

36:04.416 --> 36:05.625
-It's over.

36:05.708 --> 36:06.708
No more fighting.

36:06.791 --> 36:07.708
Is it?

36:10.958 --> 36:13.208
You're really gonna make me
do this again?

36:19.875 --> 36:20.708
Oops.

36:21.375 --> 36:23.833
Fairy magic isn't an infinite well.

36:23.916 --> 36:26.875
And looks like your little rage moment
tapped you out.

36:27.958 --> 36:30.125
Even the Dragon Flame has limits.

36:31.041 --> 36:34.916
So the only thing that's actually changed

36:35.000 --> 36:37.500
is that Beatrix
sacrificed herself for nothing.

36:38.041 --> 36:39.000
Sucks for her.

36:39.583 --> 36:40.750
Sacrificed herself?

36:52.208 --> 36:53.208
You're a monster.

36:54.083 --> 36:59.500
Yeah, I'm also a fuck ton stronger
than each of you, so…

37:01.041 --> 37:03.541
Yeah, but are you stronger than all of us?

38:48.041 --> 38:49.458
-Luke?

38:50.958 --> 38:51.958
Hey.

39:00.791 --> 39:01.791
They did it.

39:16.166 --> 39:17.000
Hey.

39:25.125 --> 39:26.125
What happened?

39:27.625 --> 39:28.833
Um…

39:32.666 --> 39:33.958
You kind of, uh…

39:34.958 --> 39:35.833
died.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.500
-It's a long story.
-Can't wait to hear about it.

39:42.125 --> 39:43.625
Bloom. Bloom.

39:46.166 --> 39:47.291
Bloom.

39:47.375 --> 39:48.375
You okay?

39:48.958 --> 39:49.958
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

39:50.041 --> 39:51.958
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Okay.

39:52.458 --> 39:54.583
We have to get everyone back to the suite.

39:57.500 --> 40:00.583
-All right. Who else needs more pillows?
-Me, please.

40:01.166 --> 40:02.458
-Here.
-Thank you.

40:02.541 --> 40:04.125
Is that one of mine?

40:04.875 --> 40:07.375
-I just have high pillow standards.
-[Terra laughs[

40:08.750 --> 40:11.666
I've raided every vending machine, so…

40:11.750 --> 40:13.250
Why am I so sore?

40:14.083 --> 40:16.166
Oh, I wonder if it was the flying.

40:16.250 --> 40:19.250
Must have been the flying, right?
Anyone else? Flying? Sore?

40:19.916 --> 40:21.500
We don't need all this.

40:21.583 --> 40:24.791
Don't forget my magic is back,
so I can feel the pain you're all in.

40:25.291 --> 40:26.708
Even the quiet ones.

40:27.916 --> 40:28.833
I'm good with pain.

40:29.416 --> 40:30.916
You're good at everything.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.708
One more overachiever in the suite.

40:32.791 --> 40:33.833
Uh,

40:33.916 --> 40:36.125
my roommate, just so we're all clear.

40:37.916 --> 40:39.666
How is everything out there?

40:40.291 --> 40:43.166
It's calming down.
Blood Witches have cleared out.

40:45.541 --> 40:48.958
-Have you heard from Grey?
-Silva let him go to his family.

40:50.041 --> 40:53.166
He won't arrest him
as long as he never comes back to Alfea.

40:54.125 --> 40:55.791
I guess that makes it easier.

40:57.625 --> 40:59.625
I'm not saying
I'm swearing off boys, but--

40:59.708 --> 41:01.000
I did.

41:01.083 --> 41:02.875
And, um… and Beatrix?

41:02.958 --> 41:05.000
Silva thinks we should bury her
in the graveyard.

41:05.083 --> 41:08.333
Everything she did, she did
because she wanted answers, like me.

41:09.750 --> 41:12.125
She could've ratted me out
to Sebastian too.

41:13.750 --> 41:18.291
And she could have killed Sky for good
if she wanted to, but she didn't.

41:21.208 --> 41:23.666
I'm gonna choose to believe
that was on purpose.

41:25.250 --> 41:27.708
Imagine what would've happened
if she hadn't showed up.

41:29.083 --> 41:31.041
I mean, he would've opened that portal.

41:33.625 --> 41:36.708
I know you need rest too, so go.

41:37.625 --> 41:38.625
I've got these.

41:50.875 --> 41:53.291
You all right there?
Want me to feed these to you?

41:53.375 --> 41:54.291
-Yes, please.
-Okay.

43:06.583 --> 43:07.666
What is that?

43:15.666 --> 43:17.708
It's a conduit to the Realm of Darkness.

43:18.333 --> 43:21.875
Sebastian must have had
enough magic from fairies to open it.

43:21.958 --> 43:24.125
I thought that's why
he wanted the Dragon Flame.

43:24.208 --> 43:25.625
I did too, at first.

43:27.333 --> 43:30.916
I think he really wanted it
so no one had enough magic to close it.

43:32.541 --> 43:33.541
But now I can.

43:36.916 --> 43:37.750
And this?

43:45.583 --> 43:46.583
Say it, Bloom.

43:50.750 --> 43:51.750
Just say it.

43:55.083 --> 43:56.958
The only way to close it is

43:58.083 --> 43:59.083
on the other side.

44:01.541 --> 44:03.000
So, you wrote me a letter?

44:03.666 --> 44:05.583
You were gonna walk out
of my life forever,

44:05.666 --> 44:07.166
so you wrote me a fucking letter.

44:07.250 --> 44:11.291
-I thought if I told you in person--
-That I'd try to stop you? You were right.

44:13.583 --> 44:15.750
Don't you dare
walk through that thing, Bloom.

44:17.333 --> 44:19.916
There has to be another way to close it.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.083
There isn't time.

44:21.666 --> 44:24.250
Every second that thing is open,
the Otherworld is at risk.

44:24.333 --> 44:26.166
I don't think you wanna try.

44:27.125 --> 44:29.416
I think you've been looking for a way out.

44:29.500 --> 44:32.041
I almost destroyed Alfea today, Sky.

44:33.875 --> 44:36.500
I'm dangerous. My mom knew that.

44:37.541 --> 44:39.291
That's why she sealed herself away.

44:40.958 --> 44:42.958
The Dragon Flame doesn't belong here.

44:44.416 --> 44:45.250
I…

44:46.166 --> 44:49.083
-I don't belong here.
-You belong in the Realm of Darkness?

44:50.833 --> 44:52.375
What even is that?

44:57.291 --> 44:58.583
I don't know.

45:00.500 --> 45:02.041
Do you know what's on the other side?

45:03.708 --> 45:05.250
Is it dangerous?

45:06.916 --> 45:08.416
I don't know.

45:10.458 --> 45:11.541
Aren't you scared?

45:13.125 --> 45:13.958
No.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.333
This whole year,
I've been trying to figure out

45:18.416 --> 45:21.125
what I'm supposed to do
with this power inside me, and…

45:23.500 --> 45:24.416
and now I know.

45:25.750 --> 45:27.916
This is how I'm gonna save the Otherworld.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.041
Right here.

45:31.916 --> 45:33.541
Right now I can save it by…

45:34.500 --> 45:36.166
…by closing that thing.

45:43.208 --> 45:45.916
You mean more
than anything in the world to me.

45:48.500 --> 45:49.875
But this is bigger than us.

45:52.250 --> 45:53.625
I love you, Bloom.

45:56.500 --> 45:57.708
I love you too.

47:13.041 --> 47:14.000
She's gone.

47:14.958 --> 47:15.916
What?

47:50.375 --> 47:51.458
Am I early?

47:51.541 --> 47:53.541
-Hi.

47:53.625 --> 47:54.625
I'm glad to see you.

50:17.458 --> 50:18.750
Mom?
