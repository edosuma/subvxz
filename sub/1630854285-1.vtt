"W" who?

00:13.388 --> 00:17.350
WURG 94.9, the Urge,

00:17.392 --> 00:19.269
Haddonfield's home for rock.

00:19.310 --> 00:20.770
WILLIE THE KID:
I'm Willie the Kid,

00:20.812 --> 00:22.856
and there's n-n-nothing
you can do about it.

00:22.897 --> 00:25.650
("Midnight Monsters Hop"
by Jack & Jim playing)

00:29.446 --> 00:32.157
* Late one night
when the moon was tall *

00:32.198 --> 00:34.993
* The midnight monsters
had a ball *

00:35.035 --> 00:38.413
* At the county morgue
till the break of day *

00:38.455 --> 00:40.707
* You could hear
those monsters say *

00:40.749 --> 00:42.375
-* Hey, boo *
-* Hey, boo *

00:42.417 --> 00:44.377

00:47.922 --> 00:50.675

a-frontin' the band *

00:50.717 --> 00:54.262
* On the yakkety sax
the Invisible Man *

00:54.304 --> 00:57.307

00:57.349 --> 01:00.226

was a real weird one *

01:46.314 --> 01:48.066
Corey, you're a lifesaver.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.567
Hi.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.152
How've you been? Come on in.

01:51.194 --> 01:53.279
(playing Bach's Toccata
and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565)

01:53.321 --> 01:55.573
MRS. ALLEN:
Roger! Corey's here!

01:55.615 --> 01:57.909
Sorry this is last-minute,
but Andrea got a stomach bug

01:57.951 --> 02:00.120
-and literally just called me.
-Oh, it's okay.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.788
It's Roger's company
Halloween party,

02:01.830 --> 02:04.457
and I could care less, but...
Roger!

02:04.499 --> 02:06.918
Hope he's better at childcare
than he is at yard work.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.128
You know, next spring,

02:08.169 --> 02:09.212
you should consider
some perennials.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.839
Hydrangeas could really

02:10.880 --> 02:12.590
-balance out that dogwood.
-Saving for college?

02:12.632 --> 02:14.384
-Where did you say
you're going? -Oh, I'm applying

02:14.426 --> 02:16.136
to a few different
engineering programs.

02:16.177 --> 02:18.304
Just saving money this year
so I can go next fall.

02:18.346 --> 02:20.682
Jeremy, the sitter's here!

02:25.186 --> 02:27.272
Jeremy!

02:32.193 --> 02:33.695
(screams, chuckles)

02:33.737 --> 02:34.988
Jeremy!

02:35.030 --> 02:37.490
-Ah! You! I'm gonna get you!
-(Jeremy laughing)

02:37.532 --> 02:41.119
I'm gonna get you.
(growls playfully)

02:41.161 --> 02:42.537
(both laughing)

02:42.579 --> 02:44.164
Crash landing! Kaboom!

02:44.205 --> 02:45.373
Oh!

02:45.415 --> 02:46.791
-(chuckles)
-Beep, beep, beep, beep.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.002
Can you show me how to make
a Thunder Bomber?

02:49.044 --> 02:50.503
Number one of all time.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.964
-My dad can do the best.
-No pressure.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.924
Yeah, I'll sure give it
a shot, little dude.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.509
MR. ALLEN: You gonna be good
for Mr. Corey?

02:56.551 --> 02:58.762
-Corey. Could I talk
to you for a sec? -Yeah.

02:58.803 --> 03:00.555
JEREMY:
Here comes the Thunder Bomber!

03:00.597 --> 03:03.016
I'm gonna put the candy
on the porch.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.602
Trick-or-treat kids
can help themselves.

03:05.643 --> 03:07.896
Help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

03:07.937 --> 03:10.315
MR. ALLEN: She made zucchini
bread. It's actually good.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.359
-(chuckling)
-You have my number.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.860
-Okay.
-If there's an emergency,

03:13.902 --> 03:15.653
but we'll just be
right down the street.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.489
-JEREMY: Crash! -(door closes)
-(inhales deeply)

03:17.530 --> 03:19.866
And there is one thing
I need to tell you.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.702
Since last Halloween--
all the events and,

03:22.744 --> 03:26.206
you know, the headlines
of Michael Myers--

03:26.247 --> 03:28.041
Jeremy's been afraid
of the dark.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.460
(whispering): He's been
wetting the bed at night.

03:30.502 --> 03:34.047
And, um, bedtime has been
difficult. (chuckles)

03:34.089 --> 03:35.465
JEREMY:
I can hear you!

03:35.507 --> 03:37.175
Uh, I can read him a story
or something.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.886
-Does he have a favorite book?
-Then once he goes to bed,

03:39.928 --> 03:41.471
he talks in his sleep.

03:41.513 --> 03:42.931
Says he hears voices.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.724
He's just really
sensitive to things

03:44.766 --> 03:46.559
-that give him bad dreams.
-Right. All that just sounds

03:46.601 --> 03:48.436
like normal kid
imagination stuff, right?

03:48.478 --> 03:49.938
-(Jeremy yelling playfully)
-(door opens)

03:49.979 --> 03:53.274
-No TV and no more candy.
-(door closes)

03:54.234 --> 03:57.112
You guys can play
till 8:30, 8:45.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.447
Then he should go to bed.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.282
-Easy money.
-Yes.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.368
JEREMY:
Gonna come play with me or what?

04:03.410 --> 04:05.453
-(chuckling)
-That sounds like a threat.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.247
It's Halloween.

04:07.288 --> 04:09.582
We're gonna have
a good time tonight.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.084
-(crickets chirping)
-(dog barking in distance)

04:11.126 --> 04:13.837
(man screaming on TV)

04:16.464 --> 04:17.757
JEREMY:
Oh.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.217
-Ugh.
-COREY: Look, man, we can

04:19.259 --> 04:21.428
shut it off if you're scared
of monster movies.

04:21.469 --> 04:23.638
No. No. You're scared.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.016
(chuckling): I'm 21 years old.
I don't get scared.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.226
You're scared because you know
Michael Myers is...

04:28.268 --> 04:30.186
(whispers):
still out there.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.564
Boogeyman's gonna get you.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.774
JEREMY:
He's not gonna get me.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.736
Michael Myers kills
babysitters, not kids.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.699
(screaming)

04:44.117 --> 04:45.952
Okay, that's actually
pretty disgusting

04:45.994 --> 04:47.954
and probably not appropriate
for kids.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.622
Why don't we
shut this off, and...

04:49.664 --> 04:51.041
we can play hide-and-seek
before bed.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.625
Your parents are gonna
be home soon and...

04:52.667 --> 04:54.627
I don't want to play
no hide-and-seek.

04:54.669 --> 04:57.005
It's stupid.
I want to watch this movie.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.507
And I don't really feel like
pretending to be best friends

04:59.549 --> 05:01.801
with an ugly-ass
boy babysitter.

05:05.889 --> 05:08.641
Okay, five minutes,
and then you're going to bed.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.977
You suck at babysitting.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.521
I'm not a babysitter.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.888
(clattering)

05:47.889 --> 05:49.307
Jeremy!

05:49.349 --> 05:51.559
Turn that movie off!

05:54.354 --> 05:56.064
Jeremy?

05:58.942 --> 06:01.069
(mutters):
What are you doing?

06:07.492 --> 06:10.036
(door creaks open)

06:10.078 --> 06:11.496
Jeremy?

06:13.081 --> 06:15.125

(dog barking in distance)

06:37.605 --> 06:39.649
Jeremy?

06:39.691 --> 06:42.193
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.034
Boo!

06:51.202 --> 06:54.080
This isn't funny, Jeremy.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.793
-(door bangs shut)
-(grunts)

07:00.295 --> 07:02.088
Jeremy!

-(panting)
-(distant clattering)

07:14.601 --> 07:16.770
(Jeremy screams)

07:16.811 --> 07:19.022
(running footsteps)

07:22.484 --> 07:24.694
Jeremy?

07:27.739 --> 07:29.741
(door bangs shut)

07:33.995 --> 07:36.873
JEREMY:
Help! Corey, help!

07:37.665 --> 07:40.210
(stairs creaking)

07:43.546 --> 07:45.799
(trembling breaths)

08:00.814 --> 08:02.899

Jeremy?

08:26.047 --> 08:27.966
Jeremy?

08:30.719 --> 08:32.762
JEREMY:
He's gonna get you!

08:32.804 --> 08:35.265
He's gonna get you
when you least expect it.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.526
-JEREMY: Is it your bedtime,
Corey? -Okay, Jeremy...

08:46.568 --> 08:48.570
JEREMY (mocking): "Come out,
come out, wherever you are."

08:48.611 --> 08:50.572
You got me, buddy.
Okay, let me out.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.032
-JEREMY: Are you scared?
-Okay?

08:52.073 --> 08:53.950
JEREMY (mocking):
"I'm 21. I'm not scared."

08:53.992 --> 08:56.327
Jeremy, let me out. Let me out!

08:58.538 --> 09:00.623
You little shit!
Let me out of here!

09:00.665 --> 09:02.125
JEREMY (chuckling):
Michael Myers.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.210
-Jeremy, it's not funny, okay?
-(Jeremy laughing)

09:04.252 --> 09:06.296

09:08.131 --> 09:10.133
COREY: Hey, you're gonna
get us both in trouble.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.468
(keys jingling)

09:11.509 --> 09:15.805
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out! Let me out!

09:15.847 --> 09:17.849
You little shit!

09:17.891 --> 09:20.060
-I'm gonna kill you, Jeremy!
-(banging)

09:20.101 --> 09:21.853
-(grunts)
-JEREMY: Boo!

09:22.645 --> 09:24.606
-What was that?
-(Jeremy screams)

09:25.607 --> 09:27.400
(gasps)

09:27.442 --> 09:29.235
MR. ALLEN:
Jeremy!

09:29.277 --> 09:32.322
-Oh, no! Oh, God, no! Please!
-Jeremy!

09:32.364 --> 09:34.783
-Oh, no. Oh, God.
-(whimpers) Jeremy!

09:34.824 --> 09:36.701
Oh, my God! Jeremy!

09:36.743 --> 09:39.204
(Mrs. Allen whimpering,
sobbing)

09:39.245 --> 09:41.331
-MR. ALLEN: Jeremy.
-MRS. ALLEN: Jeremy!

09:42.415 --> 09:44.125
God, please, no!

09:45.627 --> 09:47.754
What have you done?!

09:47.796 --> 09:51.049
(John Carpenter's
"Halloween" theme plays)

10:09.693 --> 10:11.945
* *

10:33.758 --> 10:36.011

11:23.892 --> 11:26.770
(theme fades)

11:26.811 --> 11:28.271
(school bell ringing)

11:28.313 --> 11:31.191
LAURIE: Haddonfield was
a peaceful town.

11:31.232 --> 11:34.778
And then one Halloween night
many years ago,

11:34.819 --> 11:37.405
all of that was lost.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.369
Michael Myers was pure evil.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.495
(sobbing)

11:43.536 --> 11:44.704
He took our dreams

11:44.746 --> 11:46.498
and turned them into nightmares.

11:52.337 --> 11:56.049
As he was locked away
in his prison...

11:57.842 --> 11:59.803
...I disappeared into mine.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.097
(gunshots)

12:07.811 --> 12:10.313
And then, as I predicted,

12:10.355 --> 12:13.191
40 years later, he escaped,

12:13.233 --> 12:15.902
and Haddonfield was once again
forced to confront

12:15.944 --> 12:17.987
this man in a mask.

12:18.863 --> 12:21.991
(muffled, distorted screaming)

12:27.122 --> 12:29.916
His senseless brutality
ravaged my community...

12:29.958 --> 12:31.918
(muffled, distorted whimpering)

12:31.960 --> 12:33.962
...and killed my daughter.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.965
* *

12:37.841 --> 12:40.301
And then he vanished.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.847
Impossible?

12:43.888 --> 12:45.932
Perhaps.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.978
Truth would evolve into legend

12:50.020 --> 12:53.398
as people searched
for motive and meaning,

12:53.440 --> 12:56.526
looking in the shadows
for their boogeyman.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.653
(thunder crashes)

12:58.695 --> 13:00.321
(muffled, distorted sobbing)

13:02.657 --> 13:04.659
It was an accident.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.287
LAURIE:
In the years that followed,

13:07.328 --> 13:10.248
the people of Haddonfield
descended into a plague

13:10.290 --> 13:13.668
of grief, of blame, of paranoia.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.212
OFFICER:
Do you think he's come back?

13:16.254 --> 13:19.049
Michael doesn't use guns.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.718
LAURIE:
The suffering Michael caused

13:21.760 --> 13:24.179
became an infection
passing on to people

13:24.220 --> 13:26.222
who never even
crossed his path.

13:26.264 --> 13:29.809
And as the town
turned in on itself,

13:29.851 --> 13:33.897
I made a promise not to let
fear rule my life anymore.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.523
(birds chirping)

13:35.565 --> 13:36.983
I bought a home.

13:37.025 --> 13:40.487
A place to live
with love and trust.

13:40.528 --> 13:41.905
Not a trap.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.115
Not a place to hide.

13:46.201 --> 13:47.619
Hey.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.287
It has been four years

13:49.329 --> 13:52.040
since I last saw my monster.

13:53.625 --> 13:58.797
So here I am, a survivor
attempting to share my story

13:58.838 --> 14:01.299
and find healing.

14:02.550 --> 14:07.263
Michael Myers was
the personification of evil.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.019
It's theirs.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.271
It's their wedding rings.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.652
It's up to each of us

14:20.694 --> 14:22.862
whether or not we lock the door

14:22.904 --> 14:25.115
and find our resolve...

14:26.282 --> 14:28.535
...or let him inside.

14:37.836 --> 14:41.423
Let it inside.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.515
Let evil...

14:50.557 --> 14:52.267
inside.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.813
-(wind whistling)
-(alarm beeping)

14:56.855 --> 14:58.898
Allyson! Darn it!

14:59.691 --> 15:01.651
-Honey, I'm so sorry!
-What is it?

15:01.693 --> 15:03.069
Oh, fuck!

15:03.111 --> 15:06.489
Um, it's my pie.
I put a pie in the oven.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.241
Oh, shit!

15:08.283 --> 15:10.618
Oh, I must have forgotten
to set the timer.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.328
Damn it!

15:12.370 --> 15:14.831
Darn it!
No, no, no, no, Oh, no.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.499
I can get a pie from the store.

15:16.541 --> 15:20.086
No! I wanted to bake you
a pumpkin pie.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.796
It's a Halloween tradition.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.506
-(alarm stops)
-(sighs)

15:23.548 --> 15:25.508
(groans)

15:27.135 --> 15:28.511
-Are you...
-I got to go.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.096
-I'm late for work.
-(sighs): Okay.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.057
But do you have your costume
for the party?

15:32.098 --> 15:34.100
I told you,
I don't want to go alone.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.935
So I'm not going.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.771
(sighs)

15:37.812 --> 15:39.356
Oh.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.276
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
WURG 94.9.

15:43.318 --> 15:47.280
Giving you the Urge,
with Willie the Kid.

15:47.322 --> 15:49.324
Haddonfield's home for rock.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.701
WILLIE THE KID: It is
four days until Halloween.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.745
-Can you believe it?
-(horn honks)

15:53.787 --> 15:56.456
It's time to lock your doors,
grab your knife for the fight.

15:56.498 --> 15:57.999
You ready? You ready in case

15:58.041 --> 16:00.126
the Boogeyman decides
to come out and play?

16:00.168 --> 16:01.670
(over radio):
I know I am.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.755
But let's talk about that
Michael Myers for a minute.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.424
How does one man get shot at,
stabbed up

16:06.466 --> 16:09.260
and then he fall
down the street and get back up

16:09.302 --> 16:12.180
to scare the piss out of
everybody in Haddonfield?

16:12.222 --> 16:14.808
Let me tell you how--
'cause this isn't a man.

16:14.849 --> 16:18.687
This is more than a man.
This is a beast. (growls)

16:18.728 --> 16:20.522
One that doesn't bleed...

16:20.563 --> 16:23.483
I'm pretty sure
that was in the change order.

16:23.525 --> 16:25.735
Hold-hold on a second, Shannon.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.570
Hey, Corey, you're late!

16:27.612 --> 16:29.531
You're late again!

16:29.572 --> 16:31.574
WILLIE THE KID (over radio):
It's been four years.

16:31.616 --> 16:32.534
Where y'all at?

16:32.575 --> 16:34.494
Training for the big day,
perhaps?

16:34.536 --> 16:36.579
Getting yourself in the spirit?

16:36.621 --> 16:38.623
This Boogeyman been sitting
in hibernation,

16:38.665 --> 16:41.126
but trust me, y'all,
he'll be back.

16:42.544 --> 16:45.046
I'm Willie the Kid,
and I'll be creeping it real

16:45.088 --> 16:46.381
on 94.9 WUR...

16:46.423 --> 16:48.383
Corey, you got a second?

16:54.055 --> 16:56.099
What do you think?

16:57.183 --> 16:58.768
Yeah.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.353
Get it registered.

17:00.395 --> 17:02.272
Get some new plates.

17:02.313 --> 17:05.358
-I got no use for it no more.
-Are you serious?

17:05.400 --> 17:07.527
With a good engine pushing you,
finally make it

17:07.569 --> 17:09.696
to work on time,
you know what I mean?

17:09.738 --> 17:11.197
Does it work?

17:11.239 --> 17:14.325
Yeah, it works,
just kind of shitty.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.957
Hey, uh, Ronald?

17:20.999 --> 17:23.126
Thanks.

17:23.168 --> 17:24.878
No problem, kid.

17:24.919 --> 17:27.922
(metallic rattling)

17:27.964 --> 17:30.091
(siren whooping)

17:36.264 --> 17:38.266
(engine shuts off)

17:43.938 --> 17:45.774
You're under arrest.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.859
For being the prettiest girl
I know.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.194
That's nice, Doug.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.571
Is that why you pulled me over?

17:51.613 --> 17:54.074
No. I pulled you over
'cause I miss you.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.533
You miss me?

17:55.575 --> 17:57.077
(chuckling):
Just kidding.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.328
Pulled you over
'cause it looks like

17:58.370 --> 17:59.746
your muffler's about
to fall off.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.247
Better get that fixed
before you have a bigger

18:01.289 --> 18:03.541
-problem on your hands.
-(engine starts)

18:04.918 --> 18:07.629
-(vehicle departing)
-(metallic rattling resumes)

18:07.671 --> 18:11.466
* Oilliphéist in the sea *

18:11.508 --> 18:16.304
* Nail my hands to the door *

18:16.346 --> 18:19.140
* And my knees to the floor *

18:20.558 --> 18:23.019
* Stop the water climbing *

18:23.061 --> 18:25.021
* Get to the shore *

18:25.063 --> 18:27.315
* There's a hole in the boat *

18:27.357 --> 18:29.693
* And it won't stay afloat *

18:29.734 --> 18:31.820
(fades in distance):
* Oilliphéist... *

18:43.873 --> 18:45.625
(entry bell chimes)

18:45.667 --> 18:47.961
(rock music playing low
through speakers)

18:48.003 --> 18:50.338
PROPRIETOR: You gonna buy
something or what?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.427
BILLY:
I could've drove here.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.970
STACY: Chill.
I'm the designated driver.

18:57.012 --> 18:59.347
-I know how to drive.
-Don't mess up my car, please.

18:59.389 --> 19:00.807
-I'm not gonna mess up your car.
-All right?

19:00.849 --> 19:02.642
-Don't mess it up.
-Chill. (chuckles)

19:02.684 --> 19:04.269
-His dad is...
-I got my license.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.354
It's no hating on. Come on.

19:06.396 --> 19:08.648
-TERRY: Billy. I.D.?
-STACY: So what's the plan?

19:08.690 --> 19:10.775
-Give me the I.D. -I.D.?
-(entry bell chimes)

19:10.817 --> 19:12.235
-Yeah.
-It got confiscated last week.

19:12.277 --> 19:13.570
-I told you.
-She's got the money.

19:13.611 --> 19:14.821
-You don't have your I.D.?
-Wait. You what?

19:14.863 --> 19:16.031
-Wait. Hold on. Hey, yo!
-I lost it.

19:16.072 --> 19:18.241
Wait. (chuckles) New friend.

19:18.283 --> 19:20.702
What, drinking a little milk.
(chuckles)

19:20.744 --> 19:22.454
-Yeah. Yeah.
-I like milk, too.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.330
-Look, here's the deal, man.
-(Billy wolf whistles)

19:24.372 --> 19:26.041
We're seniors, okay?

19:26.082 --> 19:28.335
We've been practicing for our
show the whole year, you know.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.337
Loading up for,
uh, tonight's game and--

19:30.378 --> 19:32.630
Well, we're in
the fucking marching band.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.300
We were just hoping you could
be a cool new friend, you know.

19:35.342 --> 19:36.843
Just buy us
a couple of six-packs.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.805
(chuckles, grunts)

19:40.847 --> 19:44.184
Just-just for me and my crew.
Come on, man. (chuckles)

19:44.225 --> 19:45.977
Uh, no.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.563
No?

19:48.605 --> 19:50.106
No-no, thank you? What?

19:50.148 --> 19:51.566
-No, I can't.
-STACY: Oh, wait.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.735
-I know who you are.
-You did something messy.

19:53.777 --> 19:55.945
-STACY: I can't believe they
let you off. -Well, who is he?

19:55.987 --> 19:57.489
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.033
You're that psycho babysitter.

20:00.075 --> 20:01.326
He killed that kid, didn't he?

20:01.368 --> 20:02.994
-Yep.
-Killed a kid and too pussy

20:03.036 --> 20:04.371
-to buy us some fucking beer?
-MARGO: Guys, you know what?

20:04.412 --> 20:05.622
Let's just fucking
forget about it.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.040
Let's just go
to the game, okay?

20:07.082 --> 20:08.625
-You're just a little pedo.
-Look at him.

20:08.667 --> 20:09.668
-Let him know, Terry.
-That what you are?

20:09.709 --> 20:10.919
A little fucking pedo creep?

20:10.960 --> 20:12.379
-That's right.
-Get in his face, Terry.

20:12.420 --> 20:13.963
What kind of
fucked-up kid are you?

20:14.005 --> 20:14.756
-That's right. -Right.
-So where's your next victim?

20:15.215 --> 20:16.841
-Whoa!
-What the fuck?!

20:16.883 --> 20:17.842
Are you kidding me, man?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.219
-(pained shout)
-STACY: Oh, shit.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.595
-(laughter)
-(Corey groans)

20:20.637 --> 20:21.971
(panting)

20:22.013 --> 20:23.473
-BILLY: Look at you.
-MARGO: What the fuck, Terry?

20:23.515 --> 20:24.891
BILLY:
Got fucking milk everywhere.

20:24.933 --> 20:26.601
-MARGO: Holy shit.
-BILLY: Look what you did.

20:26.643 --> 20:29.145
LAURIE:
Hey! Assholes!

20:29.187 --> 20:30.730
Knock it off!

20:30.772 --> 20:31.898
-We're not doing anything.
-We're just talking, miss.

20:31.940 --> 20:33.733
-We're messing around.
-Ma'am.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.485
-(laughter)
-TERRY: Hey, guys.

20:35.527 --> 20:36.736
Would you look at this?

20:36.778 --> 20:38.446
I mean, a psycho
meets a freak show.

20:38.488 --> 20:39.781
-Wow.
-BILLY: Can't believe it.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.408
TERRY:
This is a match made in heaven.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.159
-Hey, come on. Look at me.
-Ta-ta for now.

20:43.201 --> 20:44.619
Let's go, y'all.

20:44.661 --> 20:46.413
(whispers):
Michael Myers.

20:46.454 --> 20:47.914
(Corey breathes heavily)

20:47.956 --> 20:49.582
(Stacy laughing)

20:49.624 --> 20:51.001
(glass clinks on ground)

20:51.042 --> 20:53.086
LAURIE: Are you the psycho
or the freak show?

20:53.128 --> 20:55.922
Hey, Margo, do you want to go
to the school play on Saturday?

20:55.964 --> 20:57.757
-MARGO: Yeah, sure, Terry.
-Have fun.

20:57.799 --> 21:00.010
(laughter, indistinct chatter)

21:01.511 --> 21:04.931
So, do you want to do it,
or you want me to?

21:08.268 --> 21:10.478
-(air hissing)
-(grunts)

21:15.775 --> 21:17.110
ALLYSON:
Look at it.

21:17.152 --> 21:18.111
DEB:
Are you kidding?

21:18.153 --> 21:19.320
It looks great on you.

21:19.362 --> 21:21.031
I'm sure it does,
but I'm not going.

21:21.072 --> 21:23.950
Once you put the whole outfit
on, you'll love it.

21:23.992 --> 21:27.245
I say if it's not sexy,
it's not Halloween.

21:27.287 --> 21:30.915
Well, someone's getting into
the spirit of things.

21:32.417 --> 21:36.796
This gentleman had an accident
and needs a little fix-up.

21:36.838 --> 21:38.923
DR. MATHIS: You have
significant inflammation.

21:38.965 --> 21:42.135
Um, I'm gonna be nice
and numb it here

21:42.177 --> 21:44.304
so my assistant can
clean it up really well,

21:44.346 --> 21:47.682
and then I will get back
and close it with a suture.

21:50.852 --> 21:53.521
You're gonna feel
a little bit of a pinch here.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.150
Cute, isn't she?

21:57.192 --> 21:58.485
I don't-- Ow!

21:58.526 --> 22:00.320
-Jesus Christ!
-ALLYSON: Sorry. Sorry.

22:00.362 --> 22:01.905
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Allyson, what are you doing?

22:01.946 --> 22:03.281
-COREY: It's my fault. Sorry.
-Allyson!

22:03.323 --> 22:04.407
-No.
-ALLYSON: Sorry, sorry.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.159
No. No, my fault.
It was my fault.

22:06.201 --> 22:07.994
-I-I'm so sorry. Oh, geez.
-DR. MATHIS: What a mess.

22:08.036 --> 22:10.455
Just clean it up
and get a goddamn sterile kit.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.040
And give him a tetanus shot.

22:12.082 --> 22:14.042
I'll be back.

22:21.716 --> 22:24.511
You shouldn't let that guy
talk to you like that.

22:26.054 --> 22:29.766
It's gonna make you sad, even
if you don't think it does.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.644
I've dealt with much worse.

22:33.937 --> 22:36.022
But thank you.

22:37.107 --> 22:39.526
Anyway, I've just been
dealing with it.

22:39.567 --> 22:42.779
Well, I'm supposed to
get this promotion.

22:42.821 --> 22:45.573
-But either way, it's just...
-Is it worth it?

22:47.117 --> 22:49.536
What'd you do?

22:49.577 --> 22:51.246
-Uh...
-To your hand?

22:51.287 --> 22:53.748
Uh, I was at work, and then
I had a little accident.

22:53.790 --> 22:55.709
-So your job sucks, too.
-Hmm?

22:55.750 --> 22:57.460
Where do you work?
What do you do?

22:57.502 --> 22:59.879
-COREY: Oh, a mechanic shop.
-Don't move.

22:59.921 --> 23:02.549
-Don't want to get infected.
-(glass clinks in tray)

23:02.590 --> 23:04.217
So my car's been rattling.

23:04.259 --> 23:05.927
-Rattling?
-Yeah.

23:05.969 --> 23:08.179
Uh, it's just your exhaust
system clamp's come loose.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.973
It's an easy fix.
It takes like five minutes.

23:10.015 --> 23:12.017
Super cinchy.

23:12.767 --> 23:15.770
You just need a lift
and two screws.

23:15.812 --> 23:16.938
"Cinchy"?

23:17.772 --> 23:19.399
You don't
have to fix it right now.

23:19.441 --> 23:22.777
Yeah, I don't have
my stuff, but...

23:22.819 --> 23:24.988
I am at the shop tomorrow.

23:25.030 --> 23:26.197
I can fix it then.

23:26.239 --> 23:28.575
Why can't the bicycle
stand on its own?

23:28.616 --> 23:30.076
No, no. It can.

23:30.118 --> 23:31.619
It's got a kickstand.

23:31.661 --> 23:34.414
'Cause it was too tired.

23:34.456 --> 23:36.875
(laughing)

23:36.916 --> 23:38.043
Yeah.

23:38.793 --> 23:41.046
Oh, I'm actually
getting rid of the bike,

23:41.087 --> 23:43.089
so if you want it,
you can have it.

23:43.131 --> 23:44.591
I got a motorcycle.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.384
-Oh, a motorcycle?
-Yeah.

23:46.426 --> 23:48.636
Teach me to ride it?

23:49.637 --> 23:51.306
Yeah.

23:51.348 --> 23:53.600
You have shit on your back.

23:54.517 --> 23:56.478
I'll get it.

23:59.064 --> 24:02.275
We should go out sometime
and do something.

24:02.317 --> 24:04.527
-With me?
-With both of us.

24:04.569 --> 24:05.945
I mean,
we'd both have to be there.

24:05.987 --> 24:08.448
Otherwise, it wouldn't be
a very good time.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.700
(Corey chuckles)

24:10.742 --> 24:12.869
Yeah, you don't want
to do that.

24:12.911 --> 24:16.081
Uh, I'm gonna be late
for dinner.

24:17.040 --> 24:21.336
But, uh, I appreciate the hand.

24:21.378 --> 24:23.588
It feels better already.

24:23.630 --> 24:25.465
ALLYSON:
So you did that on purpose.

24:25.507 --> 24:26.466
LAURIE:
What?

24:26.508 --> 24:27.842
He was injured,

24:27.884 --> 24:29.636
he needed medical attention,
and Dr. Mathis

24:29.678 --> 24:31.054
-is the best in town.
-Do you believe her?

24:31.096 --> 24:32.764
-Do not believe a word she says.
-(chuckles)

24:32.806 --> 24:34.391
-You know, she's a strategist.
-Fine, fine, fine.

24:34.432 --> 24:35.642
She's just trying
to play Cupid.

24:35.684 --> 24:36.559
Thought he was cute.
Seemed nice.

24:36.601 --> 24:37.602
Are you gonna call him

24:37.644 --> 24:38.645
and invite him to her party,

24:38.687 --> 24:40.063
or you gonna just go alone?

24:40.105 --> 24:41.731
LINDSAY:
Now pick a card. Mm-hmm.

24:41.773 --> 24:43.191
Oh, no. I got the death card.

24:43.233 --> 24:44.984
-No, that's not bad in tarot.
-LAURIE: Mm-mm.

24:45.026 --> 24:47.862
LINDSAY: No, that just means
a major phase is ending

24:47.904 --> 24:49.280
and a new one
is about to begin.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.825
So, that pretty much puts
a nail in the coffin

24:51.866 --> 24:53.993
with that police officer
you were dating.

24:54.035 --> 24:56.788
-Ugh, Doug.
-(Lindsay chuckles)

24:56.830 --> 24:59.290
You know, you need to find
someone that can let go.

24:59.332 --> 25:01.292
That makes you want
to rip off your shirt

25:01.334 --> 25:03.753
and show grief
your fucking tits and say,

25:03.795 --> 25:05.755
"You know what? Let's go."

25:06.297 --> 25:08.717
-JOAN: This is delicious.
-(TV playing quietly)

25:08.758 --> 25:11.177
Corey. Is it infected?

25:11.219 --> 25:13.054
Is your hand infected?
What did the doctor say?

25:13.096 --> 25:14.514
He said
it's gonna be fine, Mama.

25:14.556 --> 25:15.974
He said that
you don't need to worry,

25:16.016 --> 25:17.684
and he said it would be
terrific is what he said.

25:17.726 --> 25:19.519
Well, I just might have to send
him back to the call center

25:19.561 --> 25:22.188
to work for DeVon if you can't
give him proper supervision.

25:22.230 --> 25:24.482
I can't keep my eyes
on every second.

25:24.524 --> 25:26.735

25:27.944 --> 25:30.030
JOAN:
What the hell are you doing?

25:30.071 --> 25:32.115
Who's that calling you
under the dinner table?

25:32.157 --> 25:34.409
COREY:
Uh, it's no one, Mama.

25:35.243 --> 25:37.454
JOAN: Who's that person
you're texting?

25:37.495 --> 25:38.663
(buzzing)

25:38.705 --> 25:40.707
It's no one.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.293

25:43.335 --> 25:46.796
Boys who keep secrets
don't get custard for dessert.

25:50.967 --> 25:53.720
Don't tell her about
the motorcycle, then.

25:54.471 --> 25:56.639
(engine revving)

26:13.531 --> 26:15.241
Ford station wagon.

26:15.283 --> 26:18.536
-(engine rattling and clanking)
-Hold on one second.

26:18.578 --> 26:20.997
Something I can help you with?

26:21.039 --> 26:24.125
Corey said
I should bring it in.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.091
(engine shuts off)

26:31.132 --> 26:32.884
Get on.

26:36.137 --> 26:37.305
Okay, so...

26:37.347 --> 26:39.349
(Corey grunts, sniffs)

26:39.391 --> 26:40.767
Okay.

26:40.809 --> 26:43.103
Uh, right hand, gas.
Left hand is your front--

26:43.144 --> 26:44.354
Fuck. Uh, sorry.

26:44.396 --> 26:47.982
Right hand is gas,
also your front brake.

26:48.024 --> 26:50.610
And then left hand
is your, uh, clutch.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.946
Right foot is your back brake.

26:52.987 --> 26:56.282
And, uh, left foot is
the shifter thingy.

26:56.324 --> 26:57.492
Simple.

26:57.534 --> 26:59.703
Doesn't sound simple.

26:59.744 --> 27:01.371
RONALD:
Yo, Corey!

27:01.413 --> 27:03.498
Come give us a hand.

27:03.540 --> 27:05.291
-Hey, Ron.
-Hey, Terry.

27:05.333 --> 27:07.043
TERRY'S FATHER: I'm sorry
to bother you with this shit.

27:07.085 --> 27:09.254
My goddamn son drove
three miles on a fucking flat

27:09.295 --> 27:10.964
'cause he doesn't know
how to change a tire

27:11.006 --> 27:12.757
on a goddamn automobile.

27:12.799 --> 27:13.800
Fucking genius.

27:13.842 --> 27:16.594
Uh... I got it.

27:16.636 --> 27:18.888
TERRY'S FATHER:
Yeah, and fucking smarten up.

27:18.930 --> 27:20.348
(indistinct chatter continues)

27:20.390 --> 27:23.852
I'm gonna go help Ronald
and then fix the rattle.

27:23.893 --> 27:25.437
Your rattle. Your car's, uh...

27:25.478 --> 27:28.982
I don't care about the rattle.
I came to see you.

27:29.024 --> 27:30.650
RONALD:
We'll take care of her.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.360
Just got to be
a little smarter, kid.

27:32.402 --> 27:36.072

right here on the top. (sighs)

27:36.114 --> 27:38.074
-FRANK: Thank you.
-Be right back with the lean.

27:38.116 --> 27:40.827
Jesus, Frank, have you ever
heard of a vegetable?

27:40.869 --> 27:42.412
Well, look who it is.

27:42.454 --> 27:45.165
(grunts, laughs)

27:45.206 --> 27:46.833
-They're good for you.
-Well, I like to

27:46.875 --> 27:49.002
mix meats and make croquettes
for the guys at the station.

27:49.044 --> 27:52.213
(laughs): Okay,
that just sounds disgusting.

27:54.007 --> 27:56.092
I like your hair.

27:56.134 --> 27:57.927
Thanks.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.847
Thanks. I, uh...

28:01.890 --> 28:03.391
I just sort of
chopped it one day.

28:03.433 --> 28:06.603
It just was--
It felt like time.

28:06.644 --> 28:08.021
Wow.

28:08.063 --> 28:09.314
Somebody else fixed it.

28:09.356 --> 28:10.690
-Help.
-Yeah.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.025
There goes your lean.

28:12.067 --> 28:13.735
-Ah. Thank you, Travis.
-Have a good day.

28:13.777 --> 28:15.612
-Okay.
-See ya.

28:15.653 --> 28:18.865
But I tell you, I-I feel like
I won an extra life.

28:18.907 --> 28:21.326
-Mm.
-I really do.

28:21.368 --> 28:23.203
I got myself a guitar
at the pawnshop,

28:23.244 --> 28:24.913
and I've been
fiddling around with that,

28:24.954 --> 28:27.207
and my niece gave me
a Rosetta Stone,

28:27.248 --> 28:30.001
-and now I'm learning Japanese.
-Mm.

28:30.043 --> 28:32.671
(speaks Japanese)

28:32.712 --> 28:35.256
-What does that mean?
-It means I lost my shirt.

28:35.298 --> 28:37.717
-I think. Or I lost my hat.
-(laughs)

28:37.759 --> 28:39.761
I don't know. I... (laughs)

28:39.803 --> 28:41.429
Uh... (stammers)

28:41.471 --> 28:42.681
Thanks.

28:42.722 --> 28:45.058
Uh, (clears throat) who knows?

28:45.100 --> 28:47.060
Maybe I'll fly over
for the cherry blossoms.

28:47.102 --> 28:49.437
Test it out on the locals.

28:50.897 --> 28:54.317
You still got your nose in
that, uh, book you're writing?

28:56.152 --> 28:57.904
Your fault. It was your idea.

28:57.946 --> 29:00.198
-It was?
-(register beeping)

29:00.240 --> 29:01.533

with Allyson.

29:04.411 --> 29:06.830

It's nice.

29:06.871 --> 29:09.040
Uh...

29:09.082 --> 29:12.669
You know, she's been
talking to this guy.

29:12.711 --> 29:15.380
You probably know him.

29:15.422 --> 29:16.589
Corey Cunningham.

29:16.631 --> 29:19.009
Oh, yeah. I do know.

29:19.050 --> 29:21.678
He's a good kid.
Had a tough break.

29:21.720 --> 29:25.765
It's nice to know somebody's
out there looking out for him.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.225
I like your face.

29:27.267 --> 29:29.310
I mean, I like
seeing your face.

29:29.352 --> 29:30.311
So do you.

29:30.353 --> 29:32.272
I mean...

29:32.313 --> 29:35.066
I do, too.
I like seeing you, too.

29:58.673 --> 30:00.342
-I'm sorry?
-"I'm sorry?"

30:01.468 --> 30:03.428
I'm s-- I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

30:03.470 --> 30:05.305
Do you see what he did
to my sister?

30:05.347 --> 30:08.975
He killed her husband,
and he stabbed her.

30:09.017 --> 30:10.143
Took her voice!

30:10.185 --> 30:13.938
She cannot speak because of you!

30:13.980 --> 30:15.523
You were her neighbor,

30:15.565 --> 30:17.400
and you don't even know
her name, do you?

30:17.442 --> 30:21.196
You tempted
and you provoked that man

30:21.237 --> 30:24.657

left him alone.

You okay?

30:42.717 --> 30:44.094
Yeah.

30:44.135 --> 30:47.222
I would like to see
those cherry blossoms.

30:48.056 --> 30:50.100

you'd like 'em, too.

WILLIE THE KID: Whoo!
Who knows what to believe?

30:55.438 --> 30:57.816
I think the man who escaped
Smith's Grove in 1978

30:57.857 --> 31:00.276
was not the same man
who killed all those people.

31:00.318 --> 31:01.903

was murdered that night,

34:02.417 --> 34:05.128
* I can see your eyes,
I can see your brain *

34:05.170 --> 34:07.505
* Baby, nothing's changed *

34:07.547 --> 34:10.175
* I can see your eyes,
I can see your brain *

34:10.216 --> 34:12.177
* Baby, nothing's changed... *

34:12.218 --> 34:14.721
Hey, man. Can I get a beer?

34:18.433 --> 34:19.809
Hey.

34:22.562 --> 34:25.398
You're just here dancing
and having a good time?

34:27.192 --> 34:28.693
I'm sorry.

34:28.735 --> 34:30.111
You're sorry? Oh.

34:30.153 --> 34:33.281
Sorry?
Sorry for killing my son?

34:35.241 --> 34:37.452
I wake up every day,

34:37.494 --> 34:39.621
and I can't get past the pain.

34:39.662 --> 34:42.916
It kills me. Do you understand?

34:42.957 --> 34:44.417
You think you can come here--

34:44.459 --> 34:46.252
No, you don't understand
if you think you can come here

34:46.294 --> 34:47.629
and take off your little mask

34:47.671 --> 34:49.631
and have a good time
with your friends.

34:49.673 --> 34:52.425
A judge might have said you're
innocent, but I know you.

34:52.467 --> 34:54.094
I know it was no accident.

34:54.135 --> 34:55.428
It was no accident!

34:55.470 --> 34:58.556
You pushed my little boy
because you got mad,

34:58.598 --> 35:01.434
and you lost your fucking mind!

35:01.476 --> 35:04.145
Innocent people don't do that!
No!

35:06.106 --> 35:07.649
Evil people do.

35:07.691 --> 35:09.067
Evil.

35:09.109 --> 35:11.111
* Why not every day? *

35:11.152 --> 35:12.278
* Are you so afraid... *

35:12.320 --> 35:14.447
Corey!

35:15.323 --> 35:17.575
Corey, watch out! Corey!

35:19.744 --> 35:20.995
Corey!

35:21.037 --> 35:22.455
-Stop. Talk to me.
-Why'd you take me in there?

35:22.497 --> 35:24.207
It's why I don't go out.

35:24.249 --> 35:26.334
-What?
-You just, you...

35:26.376 --> 35:28.169
you threw me in the middle
of it, and then you...

35:28.211 --> 35:30.463
-I... I...
-Where were you?

35:30.505 --> 35:32.757
I didn't know
what was happening in there.

35:32.799 --> 35:35.218
I-I was just trying, I was just
trying to help you to just...

35:35.260 --> 35:36.386
I'm not your fucking project,
Allyson!

35:36.428 --> 35:39.264
I just-- Corey, I know!

35:39.305 --> 35:42.475
Okay?
I know what it's like to have

35:42.517 --> 35:44.477
everybody looking at you,
thinking that they know you,

35:44.519 --> 35:46.271
thinking that they know
what you've been through,

35:46.312 --> 35:47.605
but they don't.

35:49.024 --> 35:52.944
But when I look at you--
when I saw you the other day,

35:52.986 --> 35:54.487
I just saw a person.

35:54.529 --> 35:57.949
Just a person just trying
to figure it the fuck out.

35:57.991 --> 36:01.327
Trying to wake up every day
not scared and alone.

36:01.369 --> 36:05.415
But the difference, Allyson,
between me and you

36:05.457 --> 36:07.917
is that people look at me like,

36:07.959 --> 36:10.253
"Who is this guy?
Who is this monster?"

36:10.295 --> 36:13.423
And they look at you like--
They see you like a survivor.

36:13.465 --> 36:14.841
What are you talking about?

36:14.883 --> 36:17.594
I get it.
You survived Michael Myers.

36:17.635 --> 36:20.180
You're a hero with
your struggles, and ask anyone.

36:20.221 --> 36:22.974
I'm the psycho babysitter.
I'm the fucking kid killer.

36:24.017 --> 36:27.604
And you think you can fix me,
but you can't.

36:28.772 --> 36:30.857
I'll spare you the heartache.

36:31.858 --> 36:33.610
(whimpering softly)

36:36.237 --> 36:38.490
* *

36:50.585 --> 36:53.421
-(horn honks)
-BILLY (singsongy): Corey!

36:54.214 --> 36:55.882
(tires screech)

36:55.924 --> 36:57.884
Hey, cool kid. What's up?

36:57.926 --> 36:59.511
Where you going?

36:59.552 --> 37:01.930
There you are, man.
I've been looking for you.

37:01.971 --> 37:04.391
-MARGO: Terry.
-I want to apologize, okay?

37:04.432 --> 37:05.725
MARGO (whispers):
Ugh, Jesus Christ.

37:05.767 --> 37:07.769
TERRY:
So what do you say, Corey? Huh?

37:07.811 --> 37:10.939
How about this?
Handshakes and friendship.

37:13.775 --> 37:16.027
Don't leave him hanging, dude.

37:18.780 --> 37:20.782
* *

37:21.533 --> 37:23.368
-(grunts)
-(Stacy laughing)

37:23.410 --> 37:24.953
What is your problem
with this kid?

37:27.288 --> 37:29.082
-TERRY: This guy fucked up
the LeBaron. -STACY: Hell yeah.

37:29.124 --> 37:31.126
-BILLY: Dollar store designer
frames? -(Corey grunts)

37:31.167 --> 37:33.044
STACY:
Oops. (chuckles)

37:33.086 --> 37:34.796
BILLY: Hey, let me
help you up. Come on.

37:35.505 --> 37:37.298
-(grunts)
-(laughter)

37:37.340 --> 37:38.758
-Sorry.
-Are you okay?

37:38.800 --> 37:40.218
-TERRY: Whoa. Whoa.
-COREY: Get the fuck back!

37:40.260 --> 37:41.428
-Hey! Hey!
-Get back!

37:41.469 --> 37:42.762
-Get back!
-Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

37:42.804 --> 37:44.514
-MARGO: I'm just trying to help.
-Get back!

37:44.556 --> 37:46.307
You gonna murder us?
Same way you killed that kid?

37:47.017 --> 37:48.351
You little psycho bitch.

37:48.393 --> 37:49.936
You don't know
what you're talking about!

37:49.978 --> 37:51.813
-You don't know what you're
talking about. -(chuckles)

37:51.855 --> 37:53.440
You just act like
a goddamn asshole

37:53.481 --> 37:54.941
because your father
treats you like one.

37:54.983 --> 37:55.984
(Stacy laughing)

37:56.026 --> 37:57.944
It's contagious, right?

37:57.986 --> 37:59.195
MARGO:
Shit.

37:59.237 --> 38:00.780
-What did you just say to me?
-That's right.

38:00.822 --> 38:02.782
I know what it looks like
when somebody hates you.

38:02.824 --> 38:04.909
And your father
fucking hates you.

38:04.951 --> 38:07.245
-Hmm? He hates me?
-(grunting)

38:07.287 --> 38:08.621
-MARGO: Billy.
-He hates me, huh?

38:08.663 --> 38:09.706
-He hates me, right?
-Hey!

38:09.748 --> 38:11.624
Billy, knock it off. Billy!

38:11.666 --> 38:13.001
-(Stacy laughing)
-He hates me?

38:13.043 --> 38:14.753
-MARGO: Terry, what the fuck?!
-(Corey screams)

38:14.794 --> 38:16.921
-BILLY: Oh, shit!
-(Corey grunts, body thuds)

38:17.714 --> 38:19.007
-STACY: Oh, shit.
-MARGO: Oh, my God.

38:19.049 --> 38:20.842
-Oh, shit.
-Terry, what did you do?!

38:20.884 --> 38:23.136
-He fell.
-Little dick busted it.

38:23.178 --> 38:24.971
-MARGO: Is he dead?
-STACY: Go down and look.

38:25.013 --> 38:27.140
-No, you go down and look.
-What the fuck?

38:27.182 --> 38:29.517
I didn't push nobody. He fell.

38:29.559 --> 38:30.602
-Bullshit.
-He fell?

38:30.643 --> 38:32.145
Yeah, that's my story.

38:32.187 --> 38:34.147
Let's get out of here.

38:34.189 --> 38:36.441
STACY: Who's the psycho now,
Terry? Who's the psycho?

38:36.483 --> 38:37.650
BILLY:
Little prick deserved it.

38:37.692 --> 38:38.985
TERRY:
Get in the car, Margo.

38:39.027 --> 38:40.278
MARGO (crying):
We killed a kid, man.

38:40.320 --> 38:41.988
BILLY:
Come on.

38:42.030 --> 38:43.156
(car door closes)

38:43.198 --> 38:45.658
(car drives off)

38:45.700 --> 38:49.496
MAN (quietly):
* There's a hole in the boat *

38:49.537 --> 38:51.706
* And it won't stay afloat *

38:54.542 --> 38:56.544
* Oilliphéist in the sea *

38:56.586 --> 38:58.838
(body dragging)

39:00.006 --> 39:03.551
* Nail my hands to the door *

39:03.593 --> 39:05.887
* And my knees to the floor *

39:07.347 --> 39:11.559
* To stop the water
till we reach the shore. *

39:13.311 --> 39:15.188
(loud banging)

39:15.230 --> 39:16.856
Hey, what's happening?

39:16.898 --> 39:18.108
ALLYSON: Just-- I can't get
this fucking thing to turn on.

39:18.149 --> 39:19.776
LAURIE:
Okay, okay. Take a breath.

39:19.818 --> 39:20.694
-Okay, take a deep breath.
-Just let me be mad!

39:20.735 --> 39:22.696
Why can't I be mad?!

39:22.737 --> 39:24.447
-You can.
-(sighs)

39:24.489 --> 39:26.032
You can be mad.

39:26.074 --> 39:27.742
-You can be very, very mad,
-(microwave beeping)

39:27.784 --> 39:29.369
and you can smash things.

39:29.411 --> 39:31.371
Just be careful.
It's addictive.

39:31.413 --> 39:33.623
(microwave whirring)

39:42.674 --> 39:44.300
ALLYSON:
You were right.

39:44.342 --> 39:45.593
I liked him.

39:45.635 --> 39:47.387
LAURIE:
Yeah.

39:47.429 --> 39:48.888
(food pops)

39:48.930 --> 39:52.517
(squeaking)

39:54.477 --> 39:56.604
(breathing heavily)

39:56.646 --> 39:58.898
* *

40:03.278 --> 40:05.697
(soft, shuddering breaths)

40:18.126 --> 40:20.128
* *

40:30.638 --> 40:32.891
(water dripping)

40:38.313 --> 40:40.523
(gasping)

40:44.235 --> 40:45.987
(thudding)

40:47.072 --> 40:49.699
(yelping, gasping)

40:49.741 --> 40:51.451
(breathing heavily)

40:51.493 --> 40:53.703
(choking)

41:06.508 --> 41:09.010
* *

41:18.269 --> 41:20.563
* *

41:22.273 --> 41:24.192
(screams)

41:35.203 --> 41:37.288
(grunting, gasping)

41:57.892 --> 42:00.103
(slow, heavy breathing)

42:03.565 --> 42:05.817
-You see that man in there?
-(gasps)

42:06.651 --> 42:09.738
He take people in there
now and then.

42:10.989 --> 42:13.742
Why'd he let you live?

42:14.534 --> 42:15.994
I say you go back.

42:16.036 --> 42:19.205
You go back in there,
and you get me that mask.

42:19.247 --> 42:21.499
I'm Michael Myers.

42:22.083 --> 42:23.960
-The fuck?
-(laughing)

42:24.961 --> 42:27.589
He not done with you,
you little fuck.

42:27.630 --> 42:29.299
(grunting)

42:29.341 --> 42:31.259
(knife squishes)

42:31.301 --> 42:33.720
(whimpering)

42:34.554 --> 42:35.930
-(knife squishes)
-(grunts)

42:36.765 --> 42:38.725
-(knife squishes)
-(grunts)

42:40.143 --> 42:42.270
(grunts, gasps)

42:42.312 --> 42:44.356
(panting)

42:53.406 --> 42:54.532
(grunts)

42:54.574 --> 42:56.284
(panting)

42:57.452 --> 42:59.704
* *

43:01.706 --> 43:03.416
(dog barking in distance)

43:03.458 --> 43:04.668
JOAN:
Hey!

43:04.709 --> 43:06.961
Where have you been?

43:08.004 --> 43:10.131
I have been worried sick!

43:11.257 --> 43:14.094
Corey, I almost called
the missing persons.

43:14.135 --> 43:15.970
-What is going on with you?
-(banging at door)

43:16.012 --> 43:18.306
Corey, I'm talking to you.

43:19.307 --> 43:21.142
She's no good, damn it.

43:21.184 --> 43:22.727
Open the door.

43:22.769 --> 43:25.689
-Open the door!
-(banging at door)

43:25.730 --> 43:28.108
Are you trying to kill me?

43:29.150 --> 43:31.444
Corey? Corey?

43:31.486 --> 43:33.738
(faucet running)

43:38.493 --> 43:40.161
(glass squeaks)

43:40.954 --> 43:43.123
(breathing heavily)

43:43.164 --> 43:45.166
* *

43:47.961 --> 43:49.671
DEB: No hard feelings
about the promotion, right?

43:49.713 --> 43:51.131
Course not. You deserve it.

43:51.172 --> 43:53.008
(chuckles)
I thought for sure Dr. Mathis

43:53.049 --> 43:54.968
was gonna make you
the charge nurse.

43:55.010 --> 43:57.762
Deb, can I speak to you
a minute?

44:03.101 --> 44:05.145
Okay, Deb, I'm gonna
tell you once...

44:05.186 --> 44:07.939
-(door closes)
-(indistinct conversation)

44:13.987 --> 44:15.739
LAURIE:
People create their own stories

44:15.780 --> 44:17.824
and make their own choices.

44:18.616 --> 44:21.619
They believe
what they want to believe.

44:21.661 --> 44:24.164
I'm hopeful, with perspective,

44:24.205 --> 44:27.208
that my experience
will help others heal.

44:27.250 --> 44:29.294
(engine revs)

44:29.336 --> 44:32.797
You have to ask yourself,
"Am I in control,

44:32.839 --> 44:35.342
"or do the elements control me?

44:35.383 --> 44:37.093
"Life or death.

44:37.135 --> 44:41.431
Suicide or cherry blossoms."

44:42.223 --> 44:44.476
(motorcycle engine
buzzing outside)

44:55.487 --> 44:57.739
* *

45:14.881 --> 45:16.091
-Hi.
-(gasps)

45:16.132 --> 45:17.509
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

45:17.550 --> 45:19.135
I'm just waiting for Allyson.

45:21.096 --> 45:22.472
ALLYSON:
Corey?

45:26.351 --> 45:28.269
Everything okay?

45:29.062 --> 45:32.607
Uh, I got jumped
on the way home last night.

45:32.649 --> 45:34.859
These guys...

45:37.904 --> 45:41.241
Those kids from the gas station
that were messing with me--

45:41.282 --> 45:44.285
I tried to stand up for myself,
and they, um...

45:46.413 --> 45:48.289
Oh, I'm sorry.

45:51.835 --> 45:53.962
I just came 'cause
I wanted to talk to you.

45:54.004 --> 45:56.214
I wanted to say that I'm sorry
and there's...

45:56.256 --> 45:57.465
no excuse.

45:57.507 --> 45:59.592
But if you could, please,
if you could just

45:59.634 --> 46:01.678
take a walk with me.

46:01.720 --> 46:03.805
Please?

46:14.691 --> 46:16.943
* *

46:22.741 --> 46:24.993
I killed someone.

46:34.961 --> 46:37.172
* *

46:51.561 --> 46:53.605
(clattering)

47:07.869 --> 47:10.121
(notes play flatly)

47:12.040 --> 47:14.000
We were making paper planes,

47:14.042 --> 47:16.836
but he wanted to watch
a monster movie.

47:16.878 --> 47:18.963
* *

47:19.005 --> 47:21.633
Everything happened so fast.

47:26.012 --> 47:28.390
I just wanted it
to be a fun night.

47:30.350 --> 47:33.937
That's all, just...
a good night.

47:39.234 --> 47:41.444
And then it all went bad.

47:45.073 --> 47:47.617
ALLYSON:
I heard what happened.

47:47.659 --> 47:51.246
I know it sounds crazy,
but when...

47:51.287 --> 47:54.958
people would talk about it,
it was like I knew you.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.336
Like I was looking for you.

47:58.378 --> 48:00.588
And then she brought you to me.

48:03.925 --> 48:06.136
(high-pitched whistling)

48:07.762 --> 48:10.015
Has he done something bad?

48:10.056 --> 48:11.474
I don't understand
why you're here.

48:11.516 --> 48:14.269
No, no. He's seeing
my granddaughter.

48:14.310 --> 48:16.062
I introduced them, actually.

48:16.104 --> 48:17.897
Your granddaughter
should be so lucky

48:17.939 --> 48:19.733
as to be with a boy like Corey.

48:19.774 --> 48:22.027
He's handsome. He's sensitive.

48:22.068 --> 48:24.070
(sighs) I don't like it
when he stays out

48:24.112 --> 48:26.948
all night with girls,
but he's grown.

48:26.990 --> 48:29.284
He can do what he wants.

48:30.827 --> 48:33.079
Yes.

48:36.041 --> 48:38.585
I know he's had
his difficulties.

48:39.586 --> 48:40.795
My son.

48:40.837 --> 48:42.213
This town turned against him

48:42.255 --> 48:43.923
after the accident
with Jeremy Allen.

48:43.965 --> 48:45.342
They would've felt for him.

48:45.383 --> 48:46.718
They would've helped him heal.

48:46.760 --> 48:49.596
But because your boogeyman
disappeared,

48:49.637 --> 48:51.639
they needed a new one.

48:55.810 --> 48:57.645
I'm sorry.

49:00.190 --> 49:01.691
ALLYSON: After my mom
and dad were killed,

49:01.733 --> 49:03.943
I just wanted
to burn it all to the ground

49:03.985 --> 49:06.446
-and get away from Haddonfield.
-Why not leave?

49:06.488 --> 49:08.114
Why stay?

49:08.156 --> 49:10.617
All my memories are here.

49:12.452 --> 49:14.162
I think both your parents
got killed

49:14.204 --> 49:15.955
and your grandma
feels guilty about it,

49:15.997 --> 49:17.415
so she's making you her child.

49:17.457 --> 49:19.626
If you could've seen her
before therapy,

49:19.668 --> 49:21.628
sobering up, and me...

49:21.670 --> 49:23.380
I'm just terrified to think
what would happen

49:23.421 --> 49:25.131
if she were all alone
if I left.

49:25.173 --> 49:27.050
So, what, you got to stay here,
protect her

49:27.092 --> 49:28.635
from herself forever?

49:32.013 --> 49:33.598
Look...

49:33.640 --> 49:36.017
I'm sorry I lost my head
at the party

49:36.059 --> 49:38.144
and I walked away.

49:38.186 --> 49:40.105
That was a mistake.

49:41.690 --> 49:43.525
When I look at you, I...

49:45.527 --> 49:48.154
I know I can tell you
the truth.

49:48.196 --> 49:50.323
I'm not afraid of these people.

49:50.365 --> 49:52.492
I'm not afraid anymore.

49:52.534 --> 49:55.662
You tell me that you want
to burn it down,

49:55.704 --> 49:57.580
or you tell me you want
to burn it to the ground.

49:57.622 --> 50:00.834
(chuckling):
Hey. Twice in one week.

50:00.875 --> 50:03.503
Pretty cool. Hot diggity.

50:03.545 --> 50:05.005
Hey, you said you, uh...
you were gonna call.

50:05.046 --> 50:06.923
You were... you were gonna call,
but you didn't call.

50:06.965 --> 50:09.092
No, I owe you a call.

50:09.134 --> 50:11.302
Did I... did I do
something wrong or...

50:11.344 --> 50:12.721
I'm with someone.

50:12.762 --> 50:14.389
Oh. Oh.

50:14.431 --> 50:16.391
Oops. Uh, sorry for that.

50:16.433 --> 50:17.976
I'm sorry for the intrusion.

50:18.018 --> 50:20.270
Well, um, you know, it's, uh...
it's Joe Grillo's, uh...

50:20.311 --> 50:21.980
Hey, Joe! Hey.

50:22.022 --> 50:23.690
Joe Grillo's birthday today.

50:23.732 --> 50:25.608
And Joe Ross, uh,
he made a sponge cake.

50:25.650 --> 50:27.736
You two want to stop by,
get a slice

50:27.777 --> 50:30.113
-after whatever you guys
are doing? -We're good.

50:30.155 --> 50:31.948
Oh. Okay, you're good.

50:31.990 --> 50:33.241
Let me tell you, it's, uh...

50:33.283 --> 50:34.868
If you change your mind,
there's...

50:34.909 --> 50:36.536
She said we're good!

50:40.623 --> 50:43.168
(sniffs)
Hey, buddy, you got a problem?

50:43.960 --> 50:46.087
We're good.

50:47.756 --> 50:49.549
Oh, shit.

50:49.591 --> 50:51.426
Allyson.

50:51.468 --> 50:54.929
So you call
Mr. Aggravated Manslaughter

50:54.971 --> 50:56.806
at night when you can't sleep?

50:56.848 --> 50:58.266
Hmm?

50:58.308 --> 51:01.311
When you see the Boogeyman
in your nightmares?

51:01.353 --> 51:03.646
You feel safe with this guy?

51:04.647 --> 51:06.524
(quiet murmuring)

51:10.028 --> 51:12.280
(trembling breaths)

51:16.493 --> 51:18.203
OFFICER MULANEY:
Hey, man.

51:18.244 --> 51:20.705
Messing around.

51:20.747 --> 51:22.457
Allyson.

51:23.291 --> 51:25.085
Nah, nah, nah.

51:25.126 --> 51:26.586
-Psycho.
-OFFICER: You good, Mulaney?

51:26.628 --> 51:28.421
It's all good. It's all good.

51:28.463 --> 51:30.298
We need to go kick
somebody's ass?

51:30.340 --> 51:32.717
No, no. I got this.

51:37.806 --> 51:40.308
ALLYSON:
Just burn it all to the ground.

51:41.309 --> 51:43.103
I'll light the match.

51:43.144 --> 51:46.189
("Come 2 Me" by Johnny Goth

51:46.231 --> 51:48.858

pull you in tonight *

52:02.163 --> 52:04.499

You don't fuck
with Doug Mulaney!

(screeching)

55:04.429 --> 55:06.723
Where are you? Huh?

55:07.515 --> 55:10.060
You say it was an accident.

55:11.353 --> 55:13.063
But I know what you did.

55:15.523 --> 55:18.651
(rocks clattering)

55:18.693 --> 55:21.571
I'm gonna fuck your face up,
you little shit.

55:31.873 --> 55:33.500
The fuck is that?

Help.

56:03.613 --> 56:06.032
Show me how to do it.

56:07.242 --> 56:09.327
Get up, get up, get up.

Get up!

Who is it?

57:38.124 --> 57:40.001
COREY:
It's me.

57:40.794 --> 57:42.587
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

57:42.629 --> 57:44.839
I don't know
what's happening to me.

57:49.469 --> 57:51.137
What's going on?

57:51.179 --> 57:53.223
(Corey breathing heavily)

57:55.350 --> 57:57.060
Look at me.

57:58.645 --> 58:00.855
(continues breathing heavily)

58:02.399 --> 58:04.317
Who did this to you?

58:04.359 --> 58:06.111
Hey.

58:07.195 --> 58:08.655
Look at me.

58:08.697 --> 58:11.116
Did Michael Myers let you live?

58:11.157 --> 58:13.034
Or did you escape?

58:16.413 --> 58:18.665
(trembling breaths)

58:23.044 --> 58:24.963
Does it hurt?

58:25.964 --> 58:28.717
No. No.

58:31.219 --> 58:33.638
My mother saved me.

58:48.445 --> 58:50.697

59:02.292 --> 59:04.252
(birds chirping)

59:04.294 --> 59:06.338

59:22.729 --> 59:24.898
DEB:
You're fucking him, aren't you?

59:24.939 --> 59:27.901
It's, like, the perfect story
of Haddonfield in a way.

59:27.942 --> 59:29.903
Cute young girl falls
for local creep.

59:29.944 --> 59:31.279
Imagine if your grandmother had

59:31.321 --> 59:33.281
fallen in love
with Michael Myers.

59:33.323 --> 59:34.866
But she didn't.
I heard she stabbed him

59:34.908 --> 59:36.409
in the neck with
a fucking knitting needle.

59:36.451 --> 59:37.744
ALLYSON:
What's your problem, Deb?

59:37.786 --> 59:39.204
You talk to me
like I'm not even here.

59:39.245 --> 59:41.623
Do you ever just shut
your goddamn mouth?

59:42.415 --> 59:43.750
(chuckles) I know, right?

59:43.792 --> 59:45.418
I know I talk too much.

59:45.460 --> 59:48.630
I just get so excited about
all that Boogeyman bullshit.

59:48.672 --> 59:52.092
Uh-uh. No.
I-I'm vetoing that trade.

59:52.133 --> 59:54.594
Your second receiver
for Mark's last-place defense

59:54.636 --> 59:56.096
reeks of collusion.

59:56.137 --> 59:58.515
It's not a straight-up swap.

59:58.556 --> 1:00:00.517
You want to win
the championship with class?

1:00:00.558 --> 1:00:01.976
Stop cheating.

1:00:02.769 --> 1:00:04.854
Stop cheating.

1:00:05.438 --> 1:00:07.732
I keep seeing his eyes.

1:00:07.774 --> 1:00:09.609
Are we talking about Michael
or this kid?

1:00:09.651 --> 1:00:12.696
Michael's eyes in Corey.

1:00:12.737 --> 1:00:16.658
Lindsay, I was so sure.

1:00:18.368 --> 1:00:19.869
Just like the first time.

1:00:19.911 --> 1:00:21.663
Hey, Roger.

1:00:23.289 --> 1:00:25.917
There's someone
I want you to meet.

1:00:26.960 --> 1:00:28.628
MR. ALLEN:
I always liked Corey.

1:00:28.670 --> 1:00:31.297
You know, some kids, you can
tell they're a pain in the ass,

1:00:31.339 --> 1:00:33.008
but Corey was a good kid.

1:00:33.049 --> 1:00:35.093
And I just couldn't imagine
he'd be capable

1:00:35.135 --> 1:00:37.345
of hurting anyone on purpose.

1:00:37.387 --> 1:00:38.847
But with the trial, I...

1:00:38.888 --> 1:00:42.434
just started spinning
with theories, and...

1:00:42.475 --> 1:00:43.852
and eventually I thought,

1:00:43.893 --> 1:00:45.311
"Give it up.
You're never gonna get closure.

1:00:45.353 --> 1:00:46.896
There's no such thing."

1:00:46.938 --> 1:00:49.983
A couple of years go by, and
I'd see him every now and then,

1:00:50.025 --> 1:00:51.901
see the way people avoided him

1:00:51.943 --> 1:00:54.279
or how they made faces
behind his back,

1:00:54.320 --> 1:00:56.489
which, if I'm honest,
pissed me off.

1:00:56.531 --> 1:00:59.743
Because I felt like
they took my pain...

1:01:01.202 --> 1:01:03.955
...my despair,

1:01:03.997 --> 1:01:05.999
and they made it about them.

1:01:07.500 --> 1:01:09.711
And then, yesterday,
I'm on my way to work.

1:01:09.753 --> 1:01:11.212
There he is.

1:01:11.254 --> 1:01:14.674
And I think,
"I'm gonna say something,

1:01:14.716 --> 1:01:16.092
"prove my wife wrong.

1:01:16.134 --> 1:01:19.471
Let's find a way
to forgive this kid."

1:01:19.512 --> 1:01:24.601
And I pull up next to him,
and he looks at me,

1:01:24.642 --> 1:01:27.062
and it's not him.

1:01:27.896 --> 1:01:30.190
At least not in the eyes.

1:01:30.231 --> 1:01:33.902
And I don't know, man.

1:01:33.943 --> 1:01:37.030
The hairs on the back
of my neck stood up.

1:01:39.240 --> 1:01:42.535
Right then, I felt like
I got my answer.

1:01:43.703 --> 1:01:46.748
The kid who used to mow
our lawn didn't kill my son.

1:01:46.790 --> 1:01:48.416
I know that.

1:01:49.250 --> 1:01:51.753
But the guy I saw
on the side of the road

1:01:51.795 --> 1:01:54.464
was down a dark path.

1:01:54.506 --> 1:01:57.926
Did the town do this to him
after the accident?

1:01:57.967 --> 1:02:00.261
Or was it always there?

1:02:05.392 --> 1:02:07.060
DR. MATHIS: You're just
laughing at all my jokes,

1:02:07.102 --> 1:02:09.646
-aren't you?
-(Deb laughs)

1:02:09.688 --> 1:02:11.731
(sighs):
Oh, my God.

1:02:11.773 --> 1:02:14.067
All right, Alexa.

1:02:14.109 --> 1:02:17.237

1:02:17.278 --> 1:02:18.697
ALEXA: Here's
"Tell Me With Your Eyes..."

1:02:18.738 --> 1:02:21.574
This house is so...

1:02:21.616 --> 1:02:22.867
rich.

1:02:22.909 --> 1:02:24.077
-(Dr. Mathis sighs)
-(music begins)

1:02:24.119 --> 1:02:26.746
(fingers snapping)

1:02:26.788 --> 1:02:30.583
Baby, I have been waiting
all day for this.

1:02:30.625 --> 1:02:34.337
I've been saving this bottle
of Au Bon Climat.

1:02:34.379 --> 1:02:36.965
You looked so fucking hot
at the office today.

1:02:37.007 --> 1:02:39.467
-Hmm.
-(sighs)

1:02:39.509 --> 1:02:40.635
Mind if I...

1:02:40.677 --> 1:02:42.470
Bedroom's down the hall.

1:02:42.512 --> 1:02:44.055
Clean up. Take a shower.

1:02:44.097 --> 1:02:46.516
In fact,
I'll meet you in there.

1:02:46.558 --> 1:02:48.476
(both laugh)

1:02:49.477 --> 1:02:50.562
Yes, yes.

1:02:50.603 --> 1:02:52.647
* And you wanna love me *

1:02:52.689 --> 1:02:53.773
* Say you wanna love me... *

1:02:53.815 --> 1:02:55.316
Mm-hmm.

1:02:56.317 --> 1:02:57.318
Yes.

1:02:57.360 --> 1:03:00.405
(music continues in distance)

1:03:00.447 --> 1:03:03.908
* I don't care about
your social place *

1:03:03.950 --> 1:03:07.787
* All you need is
a look on your face *

1:03:07.829 --> 1:03:10.290
* When you wanna love me,
yeah *

1:03:10.331 --> 1:03:12.292
* Say you wanna love me *

1:03:12.334 --> 1:03:14.753
* If you wanna love me *

1:03:14.794 --> 1:03:16.338
* Say you wanna love me *

1:03:16.379 --> 1:03:21.176
* Why don't you tell me
with your eyes *

1:03:21.217 --> 1:03:23.303
* If you wanna love me *

1:03:23.345 --> 1:03:24.971
* Say you wanna love me... *

1:03:25.013 --> 1:03:27.057
Holy shit. (clicks tongue)

1:03:27.098 --> 1:03:29.184
Is there a doctor in the house?

1:03:29.225 --> 1:03:33.813
* If you wanna one time,
one time with me, mama *

1:03:33.855 --> 1:03:35.190
Yeah, baby. All right.

1:03:35.231 --> 1:03:36.858
Got the cheese.
We got the crackers.

1:03:36.900 --> 1:03:38.068
We're ready.

1:03:38.109 --> 1:03:39.361
(knob creaks)

1:03:40.987 --> 1:03:43.323
-(thump)
-(Dr. Mathis grunts)

1:03:43.365 --> 1:03:45.033
Dr. Mathis?

1:03:47.869 --> 1:03:49.454
-(thumping)
-(music stops)

1:03:49.496 --> 1:03:50.914
Dr. Mathis?

1:03:53.166 --> 1:03:55.502
-(knob creaks)
-(water stops)

1:03:55.543 --> 1:03:57.253
Dr. Mathis?

1:04:08.598 --> 1:04:10.558
(crickets chirping)

1:04:10.600 --> 1:04:12.310
Dr. Mathis?

1:04:30.829 --> 1:04:32.706
(grunting)

1:04:32.747 --> 1:04:34.624
* *

1:04:34.666 --> 1:04:36.167
(grunting, choking)

1:04:38.378 --> 1:04:40.213
(screams)

1:04:41.339 --> 1:04:44.718
(whimpering, screaming)

1:04:44.759 --> 1:04:47.387
(Corey grunting, groaning)

1:04:48.179 --> 1:04:50.348
-(lock clicks)
-(grunting angrily)

1:04:54.602 --> 1:04:58.064
Please, please, please, please.
Please, please, please, please.

1:04:58.106 --> 1:05:00.650
(angry grunting
and pounding continue)

1:05:05.530 --> 1:05:06.865
WOMAN (over phone):
911...

1:05:06.906 --> 1:05:08.700
* *

1:05:10.952 --> 1:05:13.455
(screams)

1:05:14.164 --> 1:05:16.624
(breathing heavily)

1:05:17.959 --> 1:05:20.086
(choking)

1:05:28.803 --> 1:05:30.305
(choking)

1:05:39.814 --> 1:05:41.191
(screams)

1:05:44.527 --> 1:05:46.988
* *

1:06:04.756 --> 1:06:08.009
("Burn It Down"
by Boy Harsher playing)

1:06:09.094 --> 1:06:11.721
* Take my heart *

1:06:14.099 --> 1:06:16.685
* Pull me down *

1:06:19.354 --> 1:06:22.023
* Take my heart *

1:06:24.401 --> 1:06:27.487
* And burn it down *

1:06:27.529 --> 1:06:29.572
* *

1:06:46.715 --> 1:06:48.466
COREY:
After the accident,

1:06:48.508 --> 1:06:51.594
I'd ride my bike over here
and I'd sit up on this roof.

1:06:53.596 --> 1:06:56.182
And I'd look up at that tower.

1:06:56.224 --> 1:06:58.226
Wonder if I could climb
to the top.

1:06:59.811 --> 1:07:01.521
It was summoning me.

1:07:01.563 --> 1:07:05.775
Like a watchtower or beacon
calling me to live my old life.

1:07:05.817 --> 1:07:07.068
To be happy again.

1:07:07.110 --> 1:07:10.196
* Burn it down *

1:07:10.947 --> 1:07:13.742
I have something like that, too.

1:07:14.534 --> 1:07:17.579
It always gave me hope,
you know, things would--

1:07:17.620 --> 1:07:19.497
well, maybe somehow
things would go back

1:07:19.539 --> 1:07:21.666
to the way they used to be.

1:07:23.793 --> 1:07:25.754
Before everything changed.

1:07:25.795 --> 1:07:28.965
* Burn it down. *

1:07:29.007 --> 1:07:31.092
Infected.

1:07:31.885 --> 1:07:35.180
I got to get away from
everybody who knows me.

1:07:37.098 --> 1:07:38.725
But I don't, I...

1:07:39.934 --> 1:07:41.811
I don't want to go alone.

1:07:48.276 --> 1:07:50.153
Corey, come on.

1:07:50.195 --> 1:07:51.863
-(chuckles)
-Stop.

1:07:51.905 --> 1:07:54.157
I think you're scared that
you don't have enough bandages

1:07:54.199 --> 1:07:55.992
to keep me together.

1:07:56.034 --> 1:07:57.118
Corey, what are you...?!

1:07:57.160 --> 1:07:58.787
(feet thud)

1:08:01.331 --> 1:08:04.209
-(laughing)
-Are you okay?

1:08:04.250 --> 1:08:05.543
What, are you insane?

1:08:05.585 --> 1:08:07.379
What, are you trying
to kill yourself?

1:08:07.420 --> 1:08:09.464
I'm not interested
in immortality.

1:08:12.008 --> 1:08:13.093
-(grunts)
-(song ends)

1:08:13.134 --> 1:08:14.427
(groans)

1:08:14.469 --> 1:08:17.055
(dogs barking in distance)

1:08:17.097 --> 1:08:19.432
The hell is going on out here?

1:08:19.474 --> 1:08:21.393
Yo, this is private property.

1:08:21.434 --> 1:08:23.895
Not safe to be doing
whatever the hell you do...

1:08:24.854 --> 1:08:27.232
Corey Cunningham.

1:08:27.273 --> 1:08:28.775
What you doing out here,
you ugly motherfucker?

1:08:28.817 --> 1:08:31.069
-ALLYSON: Corey, stop it.
-You gonna scare all the kids.

1:08:31.111 --> 1:08:32.445
You stop.

1:08:34.364 --> 1:08:36.324
I don't know
who the fuck you talking to,

1:08:36.366 --> 1:08:39.828
but, uh, I know who you are.

1:08:40.662 --> 1:08:42.789
Yeah, I know
the Laurie Strode story.

1:08:42.831 --> 1:08:47.168
She teased a man with brain
damage, and then he snapped.

1:08:47.210 --> 1:08:48.712
Look at you.

1:08:48.753 --> 1:08:50.797
You gonna make a little name
for yourself now, huh?

1:08:50.839 --> 1:08:53.091
Walking around with
this dumb bitch right here.

1:08:53.133 --> 1:08:54.300
ALLYSON:
You never shut up.

1:08:54.342 --> 1:08:55.427
Hear his voice everywhere.

1:08:55.468 --> 1:08:57.429
Oh, you're goddamn right you do.

1:08:57.470 --> 1:08:58.972
And once Willie
get in your ear,

1:08:59.014 --> 1:09:02.642
it's like your favorite song
stuck in your head.

1:09:02.684 --> 1:09:04.352
(chuckles)

1:09:06.271 --> 1:09:08.231
Y'all get the hell
up off my property

1:09:08.273 --> 1:09:09.691
before I fuck y'all up.

1:09:10.692 --> 1:09:12.277
(door opens)

1:09:12.318 --> 1:09:14.154
-All right.
-(door closes)

1:09:14.195 --> 1:09:16.656
You're right.

1:09:16.698 --> 1:09:19.284
Let's do it.

1:09:19.325 --> 1:09:21.995
I don't want to be
in Haddonfield anymore.

1:09:22.037 --> 1:09:23.997
I want to be with you.

1:09:24.039 --> 1:09:26.291
* *

1:09:40.930 --> 1:09:43.600
JOAN:
(sniffs) I can smell her on you.

1:09:43.641 --> 1:09:46.311
She's trying to take you
away from me, isn't she?

1:09:46.353 --> 1:09:48.021
That's where you go
every night.

1:09:48.063 --> 1:09:50.774
Well, I say go.

1:09:52.192 --> 1:09:54.903
You go right now!

1:09:54.944 --> 1:09:56.988
Get out of my house!

1:09:59.908 --> 1:10:01.785
Oh, no. No.

1:10:11.419 --> 1:10:13.421
I hope you find love.

1:10:17.092 --> 1:10:19.344
(slow, rhythmic knocking)

1:10:21.930 --> 1:10:24.349
(slow, rhythmic knocking
continues)

1:10:27.352 --> 1:10:29.604
(slow, rhythmic knocking
continues)

1:10:34.359 --> 1:10:36.361
Allyson?

1:10:37.946 --> 1:10:40.365
(slow, rhythmic knocking
continues)

1:10:43.576 --> 1:10:45.954
LAURIE:
It's nice to see you.

1:10:55.296 --> 1:10:57.757
You know,
there are two kinds of evil.

1:10:59.676 --> 1:11:02.595
There's the evil that exists
as an external force

1:11:02.637 --> 1:11:05.473
that threatens the well-being
of the tribe.

1:11:06.307 --> 1:11:10.979
Survival depends on
understanding and awareness

1:11:11.021 --> 1:11:15.567
and fear of physical threat
to our daily lives.

1:11:15.608 --> 1:11:18.653
The other kind of evil
lives inside us.

1:11:18.695 --> 1:11:23.491
Like a sickness or an infection.

1:11:25.076 --> 1:11:29.539
It's more dangerous because
we may not know we're infected.

1:11:31.291 --> 1:11:33.501
(slow, rhythmic knocking
continues)

1:11:36.212 --> 1:11:37.922
Am I a bad person?

1:11:37.964 --> 1:11:39.966
(laughs)

1:11:40.008 --> 1:11:41.926
Are you?

1:11:41.968 --> 1:11:43.511
Well...

1:11:45.221 --> 1:11:47.474
...we're both fucked-up.

1:11:48.975 --> 1:11:51.853
-I want to help you, Corey.
-(chuckles)

1:11:51.895 --> 1:11:53.146
Let me help you.

1:11:53.188 --> 1:11:55.315
Or let me find help for you.

1:11:55.357 --> 1:11:56.858
You can't have her.

1:11:56.900 --> 1:11:59.819
Allyson is not equipped
for this relationship,

1:11:59.861 --> 1:12:02.113
and I will not
let her get hurt.

1:12:02.155 --> 1:12:04.074
So stay the fuck away...

1:12:04.115 --> 1:12:05.950
You started this!

1:12:05.992 --> 1:12:08.870
You brought me in!
You invited me!

1:12:10.246 --> 1:12:13.375
But you're the one to blame.

1:12:15.085 --> 1:12:17.879
"You want to do it,
or you want me to?"

1:12:17.921 --> 1:12:19.964
* *

1:12:24.260 --> 1:12:26.388
If I can't have her...

1:12:27.681 --> 1:12:29.891
...no one will.

1:12:31.935 --> 1:12:35.480
You want to help Allyson?
Let her live her life.

1:12:38.066 --> 1:12:40.568
She has me now.

1:12:47.492 --> 1:12:49.494
You should give in.

1:12:51.246 --> 1:12:53.540
You should surrender
to that feeling you had

1:12:53.581 --> 1:12:56.084
the first time
you ever looked into his eyes.

1:13:00.630 --> 1:13:03.633
You secretly hope
Michael comes back for you.

1:13:06.261 --> 1:13:09.139
(chuckles)

1:13:09.180 --> 1:13:11.099
I'm the psycho.

1:13:12.183 --> 1:13:14.436
You're the freak show.

1:13:15.186 --> 1:13:17.063
* *

1:13:40.128 --> 1:13:42.130
(notes play flatly)

1:13:51.431 --> 1:13:52.640
What's wrong?

1:13:52.682 --> 1:13:53.767
COREY (over phone):
We need to leave.

1:13:53.808 --> 1:13:56.603
I can't right now. I'm working.

1:13:56.644 --> 1:13:58.772
COREY:
Tonight, then.

1:13:58.813 --> 1:14:02.609
Will you meet me at 9:00?

1:14:02.650 --> 1:14:04.903
At the diner off 74.

1:14:04.944 --> 1:14:07.155
We need to talk about
your grandmother.

1:14:08.656 --> 1:14:11.117
She wants to kill me.

1:14:11.159 --> 1:14:13.078
-What?
-Yeah.

1:14:13.119 --> 1:14:15.121
I can't take it anymore.

1:14:15.163 --> 1:14:17.916
It's time to say goodbye
to Haddonfield.

1:14:20.293 --> 1:14:23.046
(Corey panting)

1:14:24.506 --> 1:14:26.800
You got something I need.

1:14:28.468 --> 1:14:30.679
(both grunting)

1:14:47.696 --> 1:14:50.490
(Corey shouts, groans)

1:14:50.532 --> 1:14:53.868
You're just a man
in a Halloween mask.

1:14:53.910 --> 1:14:55.662
What are you gonna do now?

1:14:55.704 --> 1:14:58.331
(both breathing heavily)

1:14:58.373 --> 1:15:00.583
* *

1:15:09.884 --> 1:15:12.095
(breathing heavily)

1:15:13.179 --> 1:15:15.807
-(playful chatter)
-(crickets chirping)

1:15:19.019 --> 1:15:20.603
-(entry bell chimes)
-BILLY: Call him after.

1:15:20.645 --> 1:15:21.896
I don't want
to go to your house, man.

1:15:21.938 --> 1:15:23.273
Your dad always
fucking yells at us.

1:15:23.314 --> 1:15:24.733
Too fucking bad.
You should've got your own.

1:15:24.774 --> 1:15:26.359
Shouldn't have
any of these anyway.

1:15:26.401 --> 1:15:28.028
Why can't we go to her house?
She's the one that's rich.

1:15:28.069 --> 1:15:29.195
-Oh, what? Yeah. Shoot.
-TERRY: What the fuck?

1:15:29.237 --> 1:15:31.031
What?

1:15:31.072 --> 1:15:32.282
(engine revving)

1:15:34.242 --> 1:15:36.119
He's dead! Get in!

1:15:36.161 --> 1:15:37.579
Oh, shit. Shit.

1:15:52.093 --> 1:15:54.262
Did you find
what you're looking for?

1:15:54.304 --> 1:15:56.598
I imagine you're going
on a wonderful trip.

1:15:58.266 --> 1:16:00.477
-Were you gonna tell me?
-What difference does it make?

1:16:00.518 --> 1:16:01.895
It makes a big difference,
Allyson.

1:16:01.936 --> 1:16:04.731
I feel he is capable
of real harm.

1:16:04.773 --> 1:16:06.983
Is that what bothers you?

1:16:07.025 --> 1:16:10.904
Is it suspicion or paranoia?

1:16:10.945 --> 1:16:12.906
Intuition? An inkling?

1:16:12.947 --> 1:16:14.157
You got an inkling?

1:16:14.199 --> 1:16:16.618
I went to his home.
I met his mother.

1:16:16.659 --> 1:16:18.912
I know. He told me.

1:16:19.954 --> 1:16:21.581
So, you're what?
You're stalking him now?

1:16:21.623 --> 1:16:23.166
-No.
-And you're threatening him.

1:16:23.208 --> 1:16:25.627
-What did you say to him?
-I-I see the same thing in him

1:16:25.669 --> 1:16:27.921
-that I saw in Michael.
-Michael.

1:16:27.962 --> 1:16:29.673
Michael Myers is who you are.

1:16:29.714 --> 1:16:31.549
You're not listening to me,
Allyson.

1:16:31.591 --> 1:16:32.926
I am trying to protect you.

1:16:32.967 --> 1:16:34.427
I don't want your protection!

1:16:34.469 --> 1:16:38.556
But you-you can have
a good life, Allyson.

1:16:38.598 --> 1:16:39.891
A good life.

1:16:39.933 --> 1:16:41.685
Just not with him.

1:16:42.477 --> 1:16:44.771
You pretend like you moved on,
but it's bullshit.

1:16:44.813 --> 1:16:46.481
You're actually just obsessed
with death,

1:16:46.523 --> 1:16:47.899
like it's some sort of game.

1:16:47.941 --> 1:16:49.609
And you're not gonna rest
until you've finished it

1:16:49.651 --> 1:16:52.237
or until everybody else is as
fucking miserable as you are!

1:16:52.278 --> 1:16:54.948
I need to get out of here
before this town kills

1:16:54.989 --> 1:16:57.826
the one person that actually
makes me feel something.

1:16:59.160 --> 1:17:01.955
-He is on a dark path!
-(sighs)

1:17:01.996 --> 1:17:03.623
I'm not gonna
let this happen to you!

1:17:03.665 --> 1:17:05.166
You have to believe me!

1:17:05.208 --> 1:17:07.919
Believe you?

1:17:07.961 --> 1:17:09.963
You want me to believe you?

1:17:10.005 --> 1:17:13.091
Because of the hysteria
that you caused

1:17:13.133 --> 1:17:16.761
when I trusted you,
my friends are dead.

1:17:16.803 --> 1:17:18.304
My parents are dead.

1:17:18.346 --> 1:17:22.267
You're the one
that's capable of fucking harm!

1:17:22.308 --> 1:17:24.728
(gunfire and tires screeching
over headphones)

1:17:27.647 --> 1:17:29.149

BILLY: You sure
he turned in here, dude?

1:17:36.448 --> 1:17:38.033
TERRY: Yeah, it's like
his hideout or something.

1:17:38.074 --> 1:17:39.492
It's where he works.

1:17:39.534 --> 1:17:42.120
-His work is a dump.
-It actually is a dump.

1:17:42.162 --> 1:17:43.955
STACY: (chuckles) Okay, no,
but seriously, where is he?

1:17:43.997 --> 1:17:45.290
-TERRY: There's the bike.
-Shit, dude, pull over.

1:17:45.331 --> 1:17:47.917
STACY:
This is gonna be so crazy.

1:17:48.877 --> 1:17:50.837
-Let's go.
-MARGO: Billy, can you hurry up?

1:17:50.879 --> 1:17:52.464
-Corey!
-You're squishing me.

1:17:52.505 --> 1:17:54.174
-God.
-Where'd he go?

1:17:54.215 --> 1:17:55.383
Come out, Corey!

1:17:57.260 --> 1:17:59.262
Corey, I just want to kiss
and make up, my man!

1:17:59.304 --> 1:18:00.930
-Come on!
-Stop being a punk!

1:18:00.972 --> 1:18:02.849
-(singsongy): Corey!
-Where you at, man?

1:18:02.891 --> 1:18:05.101
I'll show you what happens when
you mess with my dad's car!

1:18:05.143 --> 1:18:06.978
-(laughs)
-Can we hurry this up, man?

1:18:10.065 --> 1:18:11.524
Oh, I got an idea.

1:18:11.566 --> 1:18:14.152
Billy, back the car up.

1:18:14.194 --> 1:18:15.111
Bet.

1:18:15.153 --> 1:18:16.529
Grab that chain. Let's go.

1:18:16.571 --> 1:18:19.366
MARGO: Terry, there's somebody
in the office.

1:18:19.407 --> 1:18:20.867
Stop being a chickenshit.

1:18:20.909 --> 1:18:22.452
Run it through the wheel.
All right?

1:18:22.494 --> 1:18:24.454
We're gonna tie it
to the back of the car,

1:18:24.496 --> 1:18:26.498
and then we'll drag it
till there's nothing left.

1:18:27.499 --> 1:18:29.084
Dusty-ass bike.

1:18:30.085 --> 1:18:32.003
-(laughs)
-Shit.

1:18:32.045 --> 1:18:34.756
-Let's go, Billy. Billy!
-Come on, Terry. Hurry up, man.

1:18:34.798 --> 1:18:36.758
-Someone's here.
-Billy!

1:18:38.134 --> 1:18:41.096
Come on, Billy!
Let's get this punk!

1:18:41.137 --> 1:18:42.055
Let's go!

1:18:42.097 --> 1:18:43.723
Oh, my God. Billy.

1:18:43.765 --> 1:18:46.226
Billy, what are you trying
to do, man? Suck your own...

1:18:46.267 --> 1:18:47.811
Oh, my God!

1:18:47.852 --> 1:18:48.978
What the fuck?!

1:18:49.020 --> 1:18:50.855
MARGO:
Terry?

1:18:50.897 --> 1:18:52.774
What's wrong?

1:18:52.816 --> 1:18:54.109
Billy's dead!

1:18:54.150 --> 1:18:55.527
-What?
-MARGO: What?!

1:18:55.568 --> 1:18:56.986
-What are you talking about?!
-(engine starts)

1:18:57.028 --> 1:18:59.739

-Stacy? Stacy?

1:19:02.492 --> 1:19:04.577

What... what's happening?!

Help, help, help, help!

Help! You got to help me!
Help me!

1:19:45.994 --> 1:19:47.871
STACY:

1:19:47.912 --> 1:19:49.247
Oh, my God!

1:19:49.289 --> 1:19:52.000
-Margo! Margo!
-(Margo whimpering)

1:19:52.042 --> 1:19:53.585
Speak to me.

1:19:53.626 --> 1:19:56.254
Are you okay? Are you okay?

1:19:57.589 --> 1:19:59.799
Stay calm.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1:19:59.841 --> 1:20:01.343
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out.

1:20:01.384 --> 1:20:03.011
-(Margo crying)
-Try to be calm.

1:20:03.053 --> 1:20:04.929
(gasps, screams)

1:20:04.971 --> 1:20:07.307
It's loaded.

Stay here.

1:20:29.996 --> 1:20:31.956
Hold on. Hold on. Hold still.

1:20:31.998 --> 1:20:33.750
Hold still!
I'll get it off you.

Stacy's dead.

1:21:11.413 --> 1:21:12.831
You're dead, too.

Gives a little fresh twist.

1:21:50.160 --> 1:21:52.328
So the blueberries, obviously,
are really hot.

1:21:52.370 --> 1:21:53.830
And then when it's
all ready to go,

1:21:53.872 --> 1:21:55.749
we'll go and freeze the custard
and then whip...

1:21:55.790 --> 1:21:57.250
Ronald?

1:21:58.001 --> 1:21:59.294
Ronald?

1:21:59.336 --> 1:22:01.046
(slow, heavy breathing)

1:22:01.087 --> 1:22:03.131
I have laundry.

1:22:05.300 --> 1:22:06.926
I can put it in your dresser,

1:22:06.968 --> 1:22:08.636
or I can leave it
in this basket here.

1:22:08.678 --> 1:22:10.597
(on TV): ...this container
and put it in the freezer

1:22:10.638 --> 1:22:12.640
for about, oh,
half an hour to an hour

1:22:12.682 --> 1:22:13.975
so it'll firm up.

1:22:14.017 --> 1:22:15.477
Now we're gonna eat it.

1:22:15.518 --> 1:22:17.270
That looks good.

1:22:17.312 --> 1:22:19.064

our monster out?

to scream about?

Willie, you should be

exploiting these tragedies.

was disposed of

There would be no tombstone,
no memorial.

1:42:58.303 --> 1:43:00.764
The mysteries were put to bed,
