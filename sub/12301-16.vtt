WEBVTT

00:18.379 --> 00:20.067
It's movie time.

00:20.067 --> 00:22.238
Okay, sports fans,
what'll it be tonight?

00:22.238 --> 00:24.697
Action or comedy?

00:24.697 --> 00:25.678
Romance.

00:25.678 --> 00:26.633
Tomb raider

00:26.633 --> 00:28.302
Tomb raider. Tomb raider.

00:28.302 --> 00:30.449
Tomb raider it is.
An excellent choice.

00:30.449 --> 00:31.900
Action it is.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.954
Excuse me. And why isn't romance

00:33.954 --> 00:35.110
on your list of choices?

00:35.110 --> 00:36.625
My vote is the only one that counts.

00:36.625 --> 00:38.322
Oh!

00:40.001 --> 00:42.609
- Pizza's here.
- Yeah, Joanne, relax.

00:42.609 --> 00:44.201
You're going to love the special effects.

00:44.201 --> 00:46.050
Oh. /Yeah.

00:52.921 --> 00:54.270
Jason?

00:57.020 --> 00:58.284
What are you doing?

01:13.445 --> 01:14.945
Take what you want.

01:14.945 --> 01:16.181
Just take it.

01:22.412 --> 01:24.542
What are they gonna do?

01:27.227 --> 01:29.486
Oh, god. Oh, god.

01:29.486 --> 01:31.699
Oh, god. Oh, god...

01:31.699 --> 01:33.976
Show me your bedroom.

01:37.483 --> 01:38.594
Lieutenant.

01:38.594 --> 01:39.590
Backup's on the way.

01:39.590 --> 01:41.035
We can't wait.

02:43.012 --> 02:45.004
Shh! All right, ma'am.

02:45.261 --> 02:47.483
Okay. Okay.

02:47.483 --> 02:48.969
Okay, ma'am.

02:48.969 --> 02:51.426
Hang on. Hang on.
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

02:51.426 --> 02:52.596
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:52.596 --> 02:53.995
Listen to me, listen.

02:53.995 --> 02:55.864
Who else is in the house?

02:55.864 --> 03:00.431
- My son... and my husband.
- Okay. Listen to me.

03:00.431 --> 03:02.102
- I heard a shot.
- All right. Shh!

03:02.102 --> 03:04.048
I'll find them, okay?

03:08.675 --> 03:11.865
Ma'am, you lie still.

03:58.074 --> 03:59.693
Son?

03:59.693 --> 04:01.711
Rescue! Get me rescue!

04:36.894 --> 04:40.254
MIAMI
2x16 Invasion

04:52.643 --> 04:54.178
Sir, we still haven't found the husband.

04:54.178 --> 04:56.908
We're not going to either.
Take a look at this blood loss.

04:56.908 --> 04:57.981
So you think he's dead?

04:57.981 --> 04:59.671
That would be my guess.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.905
No, I don't need to go!

05:02.905 --> 05:05.833
- I want to get off this thing!
- What's, hang on. Listen...

05:06.151 --> 05:07.958
What if they ask for a ransom?

05:07.958 --> 05:10.358
I, I should be in the house.
What if they call?

05:10.358 --> 05:12.655
I don't think we should
expect that call.

05:12.655 --> 05:13.914
Of course they would call.

05:13.914 --> 05:17.980
Listen to me. There is an awful
lot of blood in that garage.

05:17.980 --> 05:20.300
No. are you telling me that there

05:20.888 --> 05:24.262
isn't a chance that Ted is still alive?

05:24.262 --> 05:28.085
Ma'am, I'm sorry. / No.

05:28.965 --> 05:30.576
Ok. / Now, listen, ma'am...

05:30.576 --> 05:31.909
No, no. I have to stay still.

05:31.909 --> 05:35.934
- I have to stay here.
- Listen to me. Listen to me.

05:35.934 --> 05:37.066
Here's what I want you to do.

05:37.066 --> 05:38.312
I want you to go to the E.R.,

05:38.312 --> 05:40.604
Join your son,
and let them check you both out,

05:40.604 --> 05:42.986
and I will handle this.

05:42.986 --> 05:44.688
Ma'am?

05:44.688 --> 05:47.317
I will handle this and I will catch up with you.

05:47.317 --> 05:49.532
Okay? Gentlemen?

05:49.532 --> 05:50.995
You hang in there.

06:09.302 --> 06:12.366
So what are you doing?
Logging in all the little dolls?

06:12.366 --> 06:14.538
They're artifacts.

06:14.538 --> 06:16.228
They're all pretty valuable.

06:16.228 --> 06:18.909
But, uh, if you ask me,

06:18.909 --> 06:21.168
they didn't take the most
valuable thing here.

06:21.168 --> 06:22.340
And that would be what?

06:22.340 --> 06:25.366
That would be the first
Henderson board off the line.

06:25.366 --> 06:27.357
Ted henderson used that
in the hawaii classic.

06:27.357 --> 06:29.553
It's probably worth
a fortune to a collector.

06:29.553 --> 06:32.203
So what? Ted henderson
was a big deal? / Mm-hmm.

06:32.203 --> 06:34.867
Yeah, he was one of the
best surfers of his time.

06:35.107 --> 06:37.100
Now he makes the best boards.

06:37.100 --> 06:38.532
Not anymore.

06:38.865 --> 06:40.623
Pizza boy said the Hendersons order

06:40.623 --> 06:43.494
every thursday night at 7:30, like clockwork.

06:43.494 --> 06:46.784
Patterns and routines,
a home invader's free pass.

06:46.784 --> 06:47.937
Got a lead on a weapon?

06:47.937 --> 06:49.578
Found a casing in the garage.

06:49.578 --> 06:51.029
22 rimfire, long.

06:51.029 --> 06:53.205
Confirms at least one shot was fired.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.870
Bullet must be inside our missing body.

07:01.409 --> 07:03.051
It's a ski mask.

07:03.051 --> 07:04.910
Looks like it's been doused by the sprinklers.

07:04.910 --> 07:06.204
Planned the entry,but

07:06.204 --> 07:08.336
got sloppy on the exit.

07:08.835 --> 07:10.043
But lucky.

07:10.043 --> 07:12.782
Water may have washed away any DNA.

08:17.450 --> 08:19.276
Detective Salas.

08:19.904 --> 08:21.693
He did? Already?

08:22.323 --> 08:24.250
Oh. Interesting.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.626
All right. Thank you.

09:01.465 --> 09:02.959
Horatio? / Mm-hmm.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.430
Thought you'd want to know,
Jason henderson

09:04.430 --> 09:06.148
was released from the hospital.

09:06.148 --> 09:08.072
How's old Jason doing?

09:08.072 --> 09:10.591
Head wound. Minor frostbite.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.983
He was treated and released.

09:13.329 --> 09:17.595
Oh, and, uh, he requested
access to his things.

09:19.373 --> 09:21.774
I bet he did. / Huh.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.853
Bagged and ready for street sale.

09:26.048 --> 09:29.336
It isn't my heroin.
I'm just holding it for a friend.

09:29.872 --> 09:31.478
It's not your heroin?

09:31.478 --> 09:33.963
Do you have some heroin, Jason?

09:35.652 --> 09:38.560
Okay. I buy weed from this guy.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.256
I was light. He said hold his smack,
I'd be off the hook.

09:41.256 --> 09:43.831
Buy weed from this guy.
Who's the guy?

09:43.831 --> 09:44.637
Look, you don't understand.

09:44.637 --> 09:45.708
These are tough people.

09:45.708 --> 09:46.725
They've already killed your dad.

09:46.725 --> 09:49.962
Do you want your mom to be next, Jason?

09:53.920 --> 09:54.934
I don't believe this.

09:54.934 --> 09:57.040
I was just holding it for them.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.991
That's all. / I need a name.

09:59.823 --> 10:02.299
Jason, a name.

10:11.566 --> 10:13.415
Crime suppression unit had 20 officers

10:13.415 --> 10:15.144
roaming the north end since july.

10:15.144 --> 10:16.991
Okay, he upstairs? / Yeah.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.071
Okay, let's go.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.135
Here we go.

10:26.902 --> 10:28.921
Maurice dushamp. Haitian. Big fish.

10:28.921 --> 10:30.607
His gang moves three to four keys a week.

10:30.607 --> 10:31.858
Okay.

10:32.107 --> 10:33.790
Very easy, gentlemen.

10:34.476 --> 10:35.927
Very easy.

10:39.955 --> 10:41.631
Open up!

10:45.807 --> 10:46.847
Ma'am?

10:47.274 --> 10:49.284
Where's Maurice?

10:51.303 --> 10:53.379
Agent Brody. Ah, you should call ahead.

10:53.379 --> 10:54.897
I cook you some good haitian food.

10:54.897 --> 10:56.311
Maybe a little nice tassot.

10:56.311 --> 10:58.906
Keep your hands in the open.
We just want to chat.

10:59.562 --> 11:01.202
Who are your new friends, huh?

11:01.202 --> 11:03.522
We're here to find out if you and
one of your colleagues attacked

11:03.522 --> 11:04.968
the Henderson family the other night?

11:04.968 --> 11:05.928
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:05.928 --> 11:08.264
We're talking about a
home invasion, Maurice.

11:08.264 --> 11:09.598
Talking crazy, man.

11:09.598 --> 11:11.585
Mm-hmm. Where's your car?

11:13.417 --> 11:14.418
Show me.

11:14.762 --> 11:17.820
There you go, wasting your time, huh?

11:17.820 --> 11:19.587
Just like I say.

11:20.300 --> 11:21.555
Happy? Huh?

11:21.555 --> 11:23.488
Not yet, Maurice.

11:23.819 --> 11:25.639
Open the hood.

11:26.111 --> 11:26.753
The hood? Why?

11:26.753 --> 11:28.914
Open the hood because old habits die hard

11:28.914 --> 11:31.476
in this neighborhood, that's why. Let's go.

11:38.423 --> 11:42.424
Huh. Got a.45 and a.25.

11:42.424 --> 11:45.726
Eric, what is that?

11:45.726 --> 11:47.740
- Right there.
- Well, let's take a look.

11:56.773 --> 11:59.349
Some sort of ancient artifact.

11:59.813 --> 12:00.980
I don't know where that come from.

12:00.980 --> 12:02.283
It came from a home that was invaded

12:02.283 --> 12:04.819
last night where a family was attacked

12:04.819 --> 12:05.982
and a husband was kill.

12:05.982 --> 12:07.443
That's where that came from, Maurice.

12:07.443 --> 12:08.376
I didn't kill anyone.

12:08.376 --> 12:10.873
Agent Brody, could I speak
to Maurice alone, please?

12:10.873 --> 12:13.072
Okay. /Thank you.

12:15.171 --> 12:18.761
Maurice, I am only interested in the murder,

12:18.761 --> 12:21.600
you understand? So, let's go.

12:22.589 --> 12:23.988
The Henderson kid, he give me the statue

12:23.988 --> 12:26.150
to cover a payment for the heroin.

12:26.150 --> 12:27.907
He wasn't holding that heroin for you?

12:27.907 --> 12:30.274
I don't need no punk to hold my stuff.

12:30.274 --> 12:31.288
It was a business deal.

12:31.288 --> 12:34.397
The statue for his inventory.

12:34.397 --> 12:37.730
This thing is worth a
hundred bags of heroin.

12:37.730 --> 12:39.539
So, the kid is dealing for you?

12:39.539 --> 12:41.595
He's my best retailer.

12:41.595 --> 12:44.616
He's got a growing client base.

12:44.616 --> 12:46.458
You know how crazy those junkies get.

12:46.458 --> 12:49.756
Yes. Crazy enough to kill.

13:06.479 --> 13:08.367
The sprinklers did a number on it.

13:08.367 --> 13:09.677
There's not much left.

13:09.677 --> 13:12.671
Did you look inside the upper-lip edging?

13:13.503 --> 13:16.182
Callie, um, I've done this before.

13:16.182 --> 13:18.103
Oh, I know. It's just...

13:18.103 --> 13:19.726
Well, I saw that journal article about how

13:19.726 --> 13:21.428
particles can get blown into the stitches

13:21.428 --> 13:24.407
and you can't see them
unless you pull it apart.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.270
Now what do I do?

13:46.623 --> 13:48.747
All right, I get your point.

13:50.698 --> 13:51.897
Did you get Jason henderson?

13:51.897 --> 13:54.042
Officer has him in interview.

13:54.380 --> 13:55.932
Okay, good.

13:56.457 --> 13:59.830
Mrs. Henderson's sart nurse left this message.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.634
Sart nurse? What could this be about?

14:02.634 --> 14:04.243
What do you want me to do with him?

14:04.243 --> 14:06.974
I want you to hang on to him, all right?

14:16.679 --> 14:19.376
Mrs. Henderson? / Oh...

14:22.667 --> 14:23.904
Mrs. Henderson, the doctor tells me

14:23.904 --> 14:26.771
you're going to be okay, so that's good.

14:27.623 --> 14:30.183
Somehow I don't think
I'm ever going to be okay.

14:30.992 --> 14:32.887
That's understandable.

14:33.809 --> 14:37.248
The, um, the E.R. nurse said that you

14:37.248 --> 14:39.933
wouldn't submit to a sexual assault kit.

14:40.484 --> 14:41.632
I wasn't raped.

14:41.632 --> 14:44.344
Mrs. Henderson,
this is for your own protection.

14:44.344 --> 14:47.186
No. No. It would be too degrading.

14:47.186 --> 14:48.043
Mrs. Henderson...

14:48.043 --> 14:49.686
At what point

14:49.686 --> 14:52.476
do I get to protect myself?

14:53.558 --> 14:55.687
Or your child.

15:01.598 --> 15:04.598
How, how did you...?

15:04.598 --> 15:08.512
We found a pregnancy
test in your bathroom.

15:10.397 --> 15:13.358
I hadn't even told my family yet.

15:15.911 --> 15:18.256
This is like a bad dream.

15:18.256 --> 15:19.808
I'm sorry.

15:19.808 --> 15:21.558
But you still want me to take the test.

15:21.558 --> 15:24.104
You know, sometimes
with a traumatic event like this,

15:24.104 --> 15:26.124
it can affect your memory,

15:26.124 --> 15:28.161
so I think it's a good idea.

15:28.715 --> 15:30.437
Okay?

15:31.555 --> 15:32.877
Okay.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.351
I'll notify the nurse, all right?

15:37.247 --> 15:40.143
Lieutenant. / Yeah?

15:45.275 --> 15:48.145
Find whoever did this to us.

15:50.295 --> 15:51.918
I will.

15:53.731 --> 15:55.666
Look, I told you,
I was just holding that stuff.

15:55.666 --> 15:57.138
Let's cut the act, Jason.

15:57.138 --> 15:59.457
Maurice gave you up, okay?

15:59.457 --> 16:02.413
So here's what I want.

16:03.472 --> 16:05.517
I want...

16:05.827 --> 16:07.283
I want a list of all your junkie

16:07.283 --> 16:09.052
clients and I want it right now.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.906
So who are we talking about?
Kids at school?

16:11.906 --> 16:14.947
Mostly, and at the country club, caddies.

16:14.947 --> 16:16.940
Caddies. Who else?

16:16.940 --> 16:17.799
Who else?

16:17.799 --> 16:19.785
A guy at my dad's factory.

16:23.307 --> 16:25.385
A guy at your dad's factory.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.786
So you hated your dad that much.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.512
I didn't hate him.

16:29.026 --> 16:32.274
I, I wanted to be like him, a success.

16:32.274 --> 16:34.125
Yes, by selling heroin.

16:34.125 --> 16:35.250
He gave people what they wanted.

16:35.250 --> 16:36.706
I gave people what they wanted.

16:36.706 --> 16:41.895
Okay, I want the name of your
customer at your dad's business.

16:42.891 --> 16:45.223
I want his name.

16:47.617 --> 16:49.425
H. / Yeah?

16:49.425 --> 16:51.392
Found this substance on the ski mask.

16:51.392 --> 16:54.734
Silicone dioxide, sodium carbonate,

16:54.734 --> 16:56.980
- calcium carbonate.
- AKA fiberglass.

16:56.980 --> 17:00.019
Used to build the best
surfboards in the world.

17:16.134 --> 17:18.086
Joseph zeller?

17:23.711 --> 17:25.338
You don't wear a mask
with all this fiberglass?

17:25.338 --> 17:28.210
Ah, no, I can't stand
wearing those things.

17:28.210 --> 17:29.291
What's going on?

17:29.291 --> 17:31.396
You ever worn a ski mask, Joe?

17:31.396 --> 17:33.011
Ski mask, no. We don't

17:33.011 --> 17:35.176
get a lot of snow in florida.

17:35.176 --> 17:36.590
That's true.

17:37.278 --> 17:38.993
But it sure,

17:38.993 --> 17:42.572
it sure did get chilly up at the
Henderson's, though, didn't it?

17:42.819 --> 17:44.665
Is this about what
happened at Henderson's?

17:44.665 --> 17:49.502
Yeah, their attacker had
fiberglass in his nose.

17:50.521 --> 17:52.864
You know, all these guys, they

17:52.864 --> 17:54.573
breathe in fiberglass, so...

17:54.573 --> 17:59.215
But you're the only one who bought
drugs from their son, Joe, right?

18:02.219 --> 18:05.506
Okay, um, look.

18:05.506 --> 18:07.270
I did, I got some stuff from the kid,

18:07.270 --> 18:10.726
but I didn't murder anybody.

18:10.726 --> 18:12.843
You ever been up to the house?

18:12.843 --> 18:15.037
Yeah, one time, for the, uh,

18:15.037 --> 18:16.992
corporate christmas party.

18:16.992 --> 18:19.902
But, you know, we were all up there.

18:19.902 --> 18:23.304
- Yeah, right. Okay.
- I got to get back to work.

18:23.304 --> 18:24.820
Okay, we'll be in touch.

18:24.820 --> 18:27.064
Thanks, Joe. / Sure.

18:30.098 --> 18:31.896
You want to have PD interview every employee?

18:31.896 --> 18:32.767
Let them do that.

18:32.767 --> 18:35.848
You follow the rope used
on Joanne henderson, okay?

18:35.848 --> 18:37.520
All right, you got it.

19:29.045 --> 19:31.344
The only blood on it is Mrs. Henderson's.

19:31.344 --> 19:32.633
Okay, well, if we can match that

19:32.633 --> 19:33.813
to one of these ropes,

19:33.813 --> 19:35.131
we'll know the manufacturer

19:35.131 --> 19:36.962
and then the store where it was purchased.

19:36.962 --> 19:39.465
Okay, but all these ropes are identical.

19:39.465 --> 19:40.720
To the naked eye, but

19:40.720 --> 19:43.209
each rope has its own DNA.

19:43.209 --> 19:45.368
This for instance is, uh, double-braided.

19:45.368 --> 19:47.369
It has an outer sheath and an inner core,

19:47.369 --> 19:51.193
and inside the inner core
is a tiny piece of colored yarn.

19:51.193 --> 19:52.245
Planted by the manufacturer.

19:52.245 --> 19:54.110
Exactly. To identify the fibers.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.899
It's an industry code.
If you know the color,

19:55.899 --> 19:57.158
you know the material.

19:57.158 --> 19:59.023
Great, that sounds easy enough.

19:59.023 --> 20:01.495
Yeah, if we can find the thing.

20:07.154 --> 20:09.746
Okay, we've narrowed it down to two.

20:09.746 --> 20:11.390
What now, break out the microscope?

20:11.879 --> 20:14.532
No, I've got something better actually.

20:14.958 --> 20:17.091
This is our rope from the crime scene.

20:21.753 --> 20:23.776
Go ahead, smell it. / Eric?

20:24.249 --> 20:25.293
Seriously.

20:25.293 --> 20:28.260
Every rope is made with different
adhesives and chemicals

20:28.260 --> 20:29.945
so they each burn differently.

20:29.945 --> 20:32.284
Smells like celery. Rotten celery.

20:32.284 --> 20:36.741
Okay, so we match the smell
and the burn, we have our rope.

20:37.486 --> 20:38.884
Go for it.

20:43.978 --> 20:45.752
This one is sweet.

20:53.008 --> 20:55.504
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have our smoking rope.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.022
Rotten celery.

20:57.022 --> 20:58.792
It's prima ropes.

20:58.792 --> 21:01.297
Prima, okay, well, prima is, uh,

21:01.297 --> 21:03.252
that's a house brand right coast hardware.

21:03.252 --> 21:05.033
You said prima rope?

21:05.306 --> 21:08.097
Yeah, can you, uh, check the purchases

21:08.097 --> 21:10.496
between 4:00 and 10:00 pm last night?

21:10.496 --> 21:11.661
You'd be surprised how many criminals

21:11.661 --> 21:14.969
stop to pick their supplies up
on the way to the crime.

21:14.969 --> 21:17.749
Well, we have several eight
to ten foot purchases of prima.

21:17.749 --> 21:20.123
Okay, I need a minimum of ten feet.

21:20.452 --> 21:22.916
In that case, we have a 24
footer at the kendall store.

21:22.916 --> 21:24.152
Kendall?

21:25.178 --> 21:26.926
Okay, that's near the crime scene.

21:26.926 --> 21:28.069
That's good.

21:29.052 --> 21:31.172
This guy's got a membership discount?

21:31.172 --> 21:32.918
Every time he buys something,
he swipes his card

21:32.918 --> 21:35.631
and it gets recorded into
his purchase history.

21:35.631 --> 21:37.616
So you have his name and address.

21:37.616 --> 21:39.263
In the system.

21:42.485 --> 21:45.207
Can you check that for me, please?

21:55.475 --> 21:59.025
- Steve davis.
- Henderson boards.

21:59.234 --> 22:02.262
Another Henderson boards employee.

22:03.270 --> 22:04.856
Must be embarrassing getting caught

22:04.856 --> 22:06.401
'cause you're trying to save a nickel

22:06.401 --> 22:08.089
using your membership card.

22:08.436 --> 22:10.153
I bought some rope, so what?

22:10.153 --> 22:11.180
Rope that was used to bind

22:11.180 --> 22:13.775
Mrs. Henderson in a home invasion.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.377
I, I never been to the Henderson's house.

22:16.769 --> 22:19.369
No? Company christmas party ring a bell?

22:19.369 --> 22:22.564
Isn't that when you saw those
priceless artifacts for the first time?

22:28.368 --> 22:30.409
Your boss showing them
off the way rich guys do?

22:30.409 --> 22:34.380
Probably never thought one of
his own employees would rob him.

22:34.380 --> 22:37.407
Mr. Davis, did you pull the
trigger or was it your partner?

22:37.407 --> 22:38.443
I don't even own a gun.

22:38.443 --> 22:42.358
That means your partner does.
We're thinking Joe zeller.

22:42.858 --> 22:44.075
I don't have anything else to say.

22:44.075 --> 22:46.418
Joe zeller, he works at the factory with you.

22:46.418 --> 22:49.285
He buys dope from Mr. Henderson's son.

22:49.479 --> 22:51.564
Where is Henderson's body?

22:54.931 --> 22:58.156
I said I don't have anything else to say.

23:05.767 --> 23:07.398
Now that...

23:07.964 --> 23:09.308
that is a nice car.

23:09.308 --> 23:10.813
Oh, thanks.

23:11.249 --> 23:12.983
Bet you spent a lot
of time on this baby, huh?

23:12.983 --> 23:14.610
Yeah, she's pretty sweet.

23:14.610 --> 23:17.516
I had to modify the spoiler
just to get it to fit right.

23:17.516 --> 23:19.418
Here, I will show you.

23:22.285 --> 23:24.962
- See, no interference.
- Yeah, none, that's great.

23:24.962 --> 23:27.348
That's an interesting
shovel you have in there.

23:27.348 --> 23:29.570
You do some digging lately?

23:32.041 --> 23:33.879
I planted a tree, detective.

23:33.879 --> 23:36.144
Did you use a dead body
as fertilizer, Steve?

23:36.144 --> 23:37.430
I was released. I don't got to talk to you.

23:37.430 --> 23:40.097
Where did you and Joe zeller
bury Mr. Henderson?

23:40.097 --> 23:43.386
- I'm late for work.
- Steve, Zeller is not your friend.

23:44.868 --> 23:46.920
This is just the beginning.

24:03.229 --> 24:05.341
That's not fair.
Why do you get to go?

24:05.341 --> 24:07.601
Because I was there when
Horatio ordered the helicopter.

24:07.601 --> 24:09.156
If you're going to search the city by air,

24:09.156 --> 24:10.681
don't you need an extra pair of eyes?

24:10.681 --> 24:12.874
We're just working Zeller and
Davis's comfort zones.

24:12.874 --> 24:13.912
Thermal viewer.

24:13.912 --> 24:15.277
The body is cold by now.

24:15.277 --> 24:17.645
Thermal viewer can detect vegetation distress

24:17.645 --> 24:20.023
caused by proximity to a decaying cadaver.

24:20.023 --> 24:21.813
I expect pictures.

24:26.184 --> 24:27.973
Okay, hang on a second, Eric.

24:27.973 --> 24:29.562
Hang on.

24:30.095 --> 24:32.484
All right, here's what we're
going to do. Listen to me!

24:32.700 --> 24:36.275
We're going to stay in a one mile
radius of the henderson factory.

24:36.275 --> 24:38.040
Go ahead, go.

24:43.065 --> 24:45.632
Okay, you're looking for distressed vegetation.

24:45.632 --> 24:46.567
It's gonna be low,

24:46.567 --> 24:48.751
and it's gonna stand out.
It's gonna be obvious.

24:48.751 --> 24:51.825
That's where you will find
Ted henderson's body.

24:55.331 --> 24:58.735
There's a patch of vegetation
that's reading dark green, H.

24:58.735 --> 25:00.761
Is it surrounded by orange?

25:00.761 --> 25:02.158
Just like the hurricanes.

25:02.158 --> 25:04.566
Okay, is it distressed? / It is.

25:04.566 --> 25:07.422
Okay, that's what we're looking for.
I'll be right over.

25:59.488 --> 26:00.665
Get something?

26:00.665 --> 26:03.936
Yeah. We got a body to prosecute.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.977
Rigor already set in.

26:08.599 --> 26:10.951
Is that Henderson?

26:13.913 --> 26:15.391
That's him.

26:15.955 --> 26:17.663
Okay.

26:18.158 --> 26:19.894
Let's call the M.E.

26:22.048 --> 26:24.213
I got your page on Mr. Henderson.

26:24.213 --> 26:25.838
Your missing bullet.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.929
It's remarkably intact.

26:28.029 --> 26:29.513
Went in clean, between the ribs on its

26:29.513 --> 26:32.527
way to Ted henderson's left ventricle.

26:35.172 --> 26:38.063
.22 long rifle with a sawed-off barrel.

26:38.063 --> 26:40.337
You can tell it was a sawed-off
barrel just from the bullet?

26:40.337 --> 26:42.343
Yeah. See how the bullet's
kind of elongated?

26:42.343 --> 26:45.154
It means the shooter
put the weapon in a vise.

26:50.182 --> 26:52.142
And then sawed off the barrel,
which compressed it,

26:52.142 --> 26:54.798
so the lead gets squeezed as it comes out.

27:02.581 --> 27:04.217
So you're looking for an altered gun.

27:04.217 --> 27:07.776
Yeah. And the vise that made it.
it'll have tool marks.

27:08.975 --> 27:12.674
Horatio said that Steve davis
had a trunk full of tools.

27:12.674 --> 27:13.785
If you need me...

27:13.785 --> 27:15.910
you'll be with Steve davis.

27:22.104 --> 27:24.930
Remember H. Said Davis
had a souped-up car?

27:24.930 --> 27:28.365
Yeah, something about
an after-market spoiler.

27:47.935 --> 27:50.811
Well, that explains
why he never clocked in.

27:57.698 --> 28:00.558
I've got a sawed-off.22 rifle.

28:00.558 --> 28:02.061
Could be our shooter.

28:05.078 --> 28:07.075
Three bullets to the chest.

28:07.075 --> 28:08.242
Maybe the guilt got to him.

28:08.242 --> 28:09.788
Yeah, well, if you don't believe that,

28:09.788 --> 28:12.145
he left a suicide note.

28:13.916 --> 28:17.550
Forgive me. I didn't know that this
would happen and I deserve to die.

28:17.550 --> 28:20.784
Signed Steven davis.

28:21.303 --> 28:23.779
I don't know, suicide with
three bullets to the chest?

28:23.779 --> 28:25.635
I don't, I don't buy it.

28:25.635 --> 28:28.306
It's a.22 caliber. It might take three.

28:28.306 --> 28:29.889
I've seen it.

28:29.889 --> 28:32.086
I'm gonna test for GSR.

28:32.086 --> 28:34.497
You're gonna touch the
body before the M.E.?

28:34.908 --> 28:37.145
I'm not. The swab is.

28:40.309 --> 28:42.715
Blue. Gunshot residue.

28:49.785 --> 28:52.906
The question is, were his hands
the only ones involved.

29:05.377 --> 29:07.024
Got a dark hair here.

29:07.624 --> 29:08.977
Like Zellar's.

29:08.977 --> 29:11.866
It's gonna take more than hair
color to nail it to Zellar.

29:11.866 --> 29:14.200
That's what the DNA lab is for.

29:18.112 --> 29:22.186
Alexx, looks like Mr. Henderson
got more than a bullet, huh?

29:22.186 --> 29:23.966
Lacerations and contusions

29:23.966 --> 29:25.939
about the chest and abdomen.

29:25.939 --> 29:27.889
Fractured right zygomatic bone indicates

29:27.889 --> 29:31.005
he was hit hard in the face
with a blunt force object.

29:31.005 --> 29:33.002
Guessing a rifle stock.

29:34.366 --> 29:35.554
Anything else?

29:35.554 --> 29:36.693
No, I did the usual checks.

29:36.693 --> 29:38.682
he was a healthy, athletic guy.

29:38.682 --> 29:41.592
Only surgery I found was a vasectomy.

29:41.592 --> 29:43.721
Hmm, a vasectomy?

29:43.721 --> 29:45.147
Yeah.

29:45.147 --> 29:46.587
That's not possible.

29:46.587 --> 29:48.648
Well, it's an unmistakable procedure.

29:48.648 --> 29:50.053
Why?

29:50.053 --> 29:52.579
His wife is pregnant.

29:53.495 --> 29:54.694
Then I'd say Mrs. Henderson

29:54.694 --> 29:57.791
was stepping out on her husband.

29:58.151 --> 30:00.065
Yelina. Yeah, listen, let's canvass

30:00.065 --> 30:01.291
all the hotels near the gables,

30:01.291 --> 30:04.857
looking for rooms rented to Mrs. Henderson.

30:05.909 --> 30:07.308
She's our suspect?

30:07.308 --> 30:08.967
She is now.

30:17.974 --> 30:19.643
Excuse me. I got your message.

30:19.643 --> 30:22.375
They, they told me the results of
the sart test were negative.

30:22.375 --> 30:23.384
Has something changed?

30:23.384 --> 30:26.362
That's a pretty pendant you're
wearing, Mrs. Henderson.

30:27.562 --> 30:28.988
Thank you.

30:29.209 --> 30:31.880
It, uh... it was a gift.

30:32.083 --> 30:34.924
Did you get that from the
father of your child?

30:38.576 --> 30:39.093
Lieutenant...

30:39.093 --> 30:40.842
Mrs. Henderson, did you think we were

30:40.842 --> 30:42.838
going to miss that during the autopsy?

30:42.838 --> 30:44.420
Now, come on.

30:48.232 --> 30:49.827
I didn't, I didn't know
how to tell my husband.

30:49.827 --> 30:51.663
Now you don't have to, do you?

30:51.663 --> 30:53.652
Wait. You think I had something to do with it?

30:53.652 --> 30:54.551
I really don't know.

30:54.551 --> 30:56.714
You suddenly have a boyfriend.

30:56.714 --> 30:59.337
I canvassed high-end hotels in your area.

30:59.337 --> 31:01.088
Your credit card.

31:01.088 --> 31:03.685
A deluxe room for two at the delgado

31:03.685 --> 31:05.848
on three separate afternoons.

31:05.848 --> 31:06.969
No view.

31:07.269 --> 31:11.077
Joe zellers's parking tickets
outside of the delgado

31:11.077 --> 31:12.886
on two of those three afternoons.

31:12.886 --> 31:15.948
So Joe wouldn't spring for the valet, huh?

31:16.327 --> 31:18.660
Well, he did spring for drinks at the bar.

31:18.660 --> 31:20.007
Okay.

31:21.946 --> 31:24.935
We met at the company christmas party.

31:24.935 --> 31:26.894
I ended it one month later.

31:26.894 --> 31:29.595
I've never done anything
like this before, I swear.

31:29.595 --> 31:31.190
And I haven't even talked to him since.

31:31.190 --> 31:33.102
So all on his own, he broke into your home

31:33.102 --> 31:34.153
and killed your husband.

31:34.153 --> 31:35.880
I had nothing to do with that.

31:35.880 --> 31:38.864
Mrs. Henderson, have a
seat on the bench, okay?

31:43.543 --> 31:45.897
Here's what I'd like to do.
Let's detain her.

31:45.897 --> 31:49.717
And she is not to talk to her son, okay?

32:22.232 --> 32:24.631
Hey, Valera, you still working
on that hair from the car?

32:24.631 --> 32:25.892
Already found a match.

32:25.892 --> 32:27.792
Results are over there.

32:28.365 --> 32:30.112
So where'd you hit, CODIS?

32:34.283 --> 32:35.677
It wasn't a crime database.

32:35.677 --> 32:37.743
Hair belongs to the Henderson kid.

32:38.535 --> 32:39.621
Jason?

32:39.621 --> 32:40.971
We had his blood from when we excluded

32:40.971 --> 32:43.391
the family members for the invasion.

32:44.439 --> 32:46.568
Hair says Henderson was in the passenger

32:46.568 --> 32:49.077
seat of your latest victim's car.

32:55.010 --> 32:57.219
I didn't shoot Steve davis.

32:57.219 --> 32:59.253
So he shot himself in the heart three times.

32:59.253 --> 33:01.873
Hey, I don't know. I wasn't there.

33:03.829 --> 33:05.777
Why was your hair in the car?

33:08.995 --> 33:11.921
I, I met with him, like, last week.

33:11.921 --> 33:12.939
You sell him drugs?

33:12.939 --> 33:15.887
No, but...

33:17.761 --> 33:19.844
I'd...

33:21.445 --> 33:24.039
I'd snuck so many statues
out of my parents' house,

33:24.039 --> 33:27.339
I, you know, down payment on my inventory.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.608
I needed someone to break in

33:29.608 --> 33:33.797
and, you know, cover up what I was taking.

33:35.563 --> 33:37.142
You said if I ever needed anything.

33:37.142 --> 33:38.262
Yeah, you name it.

33:38.262 --> 33:39.950
I need you to bust into my parents' house

33:39.950 --> 33:41.826
and take a few things.

33:42.050 --> 33:43.375
No sweat.

33:43.375 --> 33:44.533
It's on.

33:44.533 --> 33:46.043
Yeah.

33:46.558 --> 33:48.032
So you arranged the break-in?

33:48.705 --> 33:50.078
Yeah.

33:50.912 --> 33:52.155
Your parents never noticed that these

33:52.155 --> 33:54.845
expensive pieces were missing?

33:55.590 --> 33:57.768
It's not like they dusted them. They're art.

33:57.768 --> 34:00.209
But, hey, you know, the rate I was going,

34:00.209 --> 34:01.910
they were about to find out.

34:01.910 --> 34:05.490
And I knew Davis from working
at the docks last summer,

34:05.490 --> 34:09.271
and he said he'd bring a friend

34:09.271 --> 34:11.447
and make it look good.

34:13.199 --> 34:16.041
And then the guy shoots my dad.

34:16.408 --> 34:19.723
I mean, I couldn't believe it was happening.

34:19.723 --> 34:21.665
I mean, we weren't even
supposed to be there.

34:21.665 --> 34:24.431
It wasn't supposed to happen like that.

34:25.081 --> 34:28.851
I, I got my dad killed, didn't I?

34:31.420 --> 34:33.351
I just want to go back.

34:33.351 --> 34:34.476
I want to go back to when we were watching

34:34.476 --> 34:36.382
a movie and everything was okay.

34:36.382 --> 34:39.121
I just want to go back there.

34:43.071 --> 34:45.719
So you got the exemplars
from our vic Steven davis.

34:45.719 --> 34:48.955
Yeah, it's an injury report
from a loading dock last year.

34:48.955 --> 34:50.581
So, what's he hiding?

34:50.581 --> 34:52.186
See the end of these curves here?

34:52.186 --> 34:54.045
How they get thinner?

34:54.045 --> 34:56.013
The pens lift at the same point on both.

34:56.013 --> 34:57.883
Is that a gap in between the letters?

34:57.883 --> 34:59.439
You mean, in the connectors.

34:59.439 --> 35:02.129
At the end of the downward verticals,
there's always a small

35:02.129 --> 35:04.566
stroke and a hitch.

35:04.566 --> 35:06.647
So do you think that Davis
is the author of both?

35:06.647 --> 35:08.752
Best way is to check the signature.

35:08.752 --> 35:11.069
With the filters, we can tell them apart.

35:11.069 --> 35:13.727
When we overlay the common letters,

35:14.169 --> 35:16.237
the dark areas are where
the strokes match.

35:16.237 --> 35:18.111
There's multiple points of similarity here.

35:18.111 --> 35:20.939
Slant, pressure, height of the letters.

35:20.939 --> 35:24.454
Q.D. Signature exhibits less
duress than his work report.

35:24.454 --> 35:26.086
So you mean...

35:26.086 --> 35:28.434
Davis wrote his own suicide note.

35:31.374 --> 35:34.503
He asks to be forgiven.

35:34.503 --> 35:36.301
It just doesn't say what for,

35:36.301 --> 35:37.725
the suicide or the break-in.

35:37.725 --> 35:40.422
I don't think he knew Zeller
intended to kill the husband.

35:40.422 --> 35:41.906
If we find Zeller,

35:41.906 --> 35:44.318
we find that vise, okay?

35:53.324 --> 35:55.444
Surprise.

35:58.690 --> 35:59.922
There he is, hard at work.

35:59.922 --> 36:00.948
I didn't think I'd see you again.

36:00.948 --> 36:03.865
You, uh, you must really like me, huh?

36:03.865 --> 36:04.899
I do.

36:04.899 --> 36:07.153
I like you, Joe, for the murder of Ted henderson

36:07.153 --> 36:09.487
and I believe that you sawed off the rifle

36:09.487 --> 36:12.913
right here in your little shop, didn't you?

36:13.729 --> 36:15.603
No. No, I didn't.

36:15.603 --> 36:18.416
No? Where's your vise?

36:23.478 --> 36:25.415
Horatio.

36:26.738 --> 36:28.559
Where's the vise?

36:28.559 --> 36:30.812
Melted it for scrap.

36:33.381 --> 36:37.283
You know, you ask me, Joanne henderson,

36:37.283 --> 36:40.082
She's glad someone offed her old man.

36:40.507 --> 36:45.271
Yeah, that lady was a classic case of neglect.

36:45.866 --> 36:48.708
Do you mind? I'm going to get back to my work.

36:53.017 --> 36:53.838
So it's over?

36:53.838 --> 36:57.871
No. Joanne henderson wears
a pendant that looks homemade.

36:57.871 --> 36:59.882
If he made it here with the same vise,

36:59.882 --> 37:02.380
it'll have the same tool marks, won't it?

37:03.940 --> 37:04.962
The pendant?

37:04.962 --> 37:07.726
Lieutenant Caine thought that Joe zeller
might have made it for you.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.027
He remembered that it was metal.

37:10.027 --> 37:11.567
He did.

37:12.355 --> 37:16.190
I took it off when lieutenant
Caine told me what Joe had done.

37:26.206 --> 37:28.365
And Joe made this?

37:28.365 --> 37:31.295
I saw him make it in his own workshop.

38:25.948 --> 38:27.559
Joe, I'm curious about something.

38:27.559 --> 38:29.030
When,

38:29.331 --> 38:32.766
when did you decide
to steal Ted henderson's life?

38:32.766 --> 38:34.836
Was it at the christmas party?

38:35.425 --> 38:36.848
They tell me that this

38:36.848 --> 38:39.610
little sword is worth over $30,000.

38:39.610 --> 38:41.502
That's a lot of surfboards.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.798
Or was it more last minute?

38:44.798 --> 38:46.019
Because you could sense that your

38:46.019 --> 38:49.058
window of opportunity was closing.

38:49.058 --> 38:51.123
Come on. Don't be like that.

38:51.123 --> 38:54.110
I told you I'd never leave Ted. I love him.

38:54.110 --> 38:58.441
What we do know is that in order
to protect your investment,

38:58.441 --> 39:01.808
you needed to get rid of the husband.

39:01.808 --> 39:03.568
Then you caught a break, because

39:03.568 --> 39:07.024
Steve davis needed a partner.

39:14.047 --> 39:16.105
You know what?
Say whatever you want.

39:17.566 --> 39:20.011
All you got is my word against...

39:20.542 --> 39:23.131
an unfaithful wife and a dead low life.

39:23.131 --> 39:25.121
Tell him, Calleigh.

39:25.121 --> 39:26.809
Mr. Zeller, when you sawed off the gun

39:26.809 --> 39:28.482
that was used to kill Ted henderson,

39:28.482 --> 39:30.388
you put the barrel in a vise,

39:30.388 --> 39:32.450
and that vise left very unique

39:32.450 --> 39:35.254
tool marks impressed on the barrel.

39:47.031 --> 39:48.733
They were the same tool marks that we found

39:48.733 --> 39:51.780
on the pendant you made for Ms. Henderson.

39:54.102 --> 39:55.645
Doesn't prove that I fired the gun.

39:55.645 --> 39:58.623
No, it doesn't, but you're
the only one with a motive.

39:58.623 --> 40:00.552
So we've got the tool marks

40:00.552 --> 40:03.902
and I believe that the jury
is going to like you.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.159
And we're very good at giving testimony.

40:06.159 --> 40:09.777
So, Joe, two words.

40:10.144 --> 40:14.100
Murder one.

40:40.587 --> 40:43.380
You think they'll let Jason
go to his dad's funeral?

40:43.380 --> 40:46.134
Mrs. Henderson, the murder
occurred during the attack.

40:46.134 --> 40:47.691
He didn't know about the attack.

40:47.691 --> 40:50.146
I understand that, but the law
sees Jason as an accomplice

40:50.146 --> 40:53.635
and I doubt if any judge will grant him bail.

40:54.492 --> 40:58.608
What matters right now
is that Jason needs you.
