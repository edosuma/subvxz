12:49.425 --> 12:52.295
These aren't pets.
This...

12:52.328 --> 12:54.397
This is meat.

12:54.430 --> 12:56.132
Meat for wha...

13:08.144 --> 13:12.315
Now, what do you think
was in there?

13:12.348 --> 13:14.517
Want my guess?

13:14.550 --> 13:17.386
A snake.

13:17.420 --> 13:19.755
A big one.

13:19.788 --> 13:24.093
[Labored breathing]

13:24.127 --> 13:27.096
I need an ambulance immediately
to 12 West Athens.

13:27.130 --> 13:29.232
You coming to get my daddy?

13:29.265 --> 13:30.833
Why would you say that?

13:30.866 --> 13:33.269
The guys who did this,

13:33.302 --> 13:35.371
cut me,
they were looking for him.

13:35.404 --> 13:37.340
I wanna take a look at this,
okay?

13:40.376 --> 13:41.610
You're a policeman?

13:45.248 --> 13:47.483
[Panting]

13:47.516 --> 13:49.418
Am I going to die?
'Cause...

13:49.452 --> 13:53.356
That's my blood,
and... it's...

13:53.389 --> 13:54.857
It's supposed to be inside me.

13:54.890 --> 13:56.625
Am I gonna die?

13:56.659 --> 13:58.127
Not for a long time.

13:58.161 --> 13:59.528
How do you know that?

13:59.562 --> 14:02.398
I can see.

14:02.431 --> 14:03.399
What can you see?

14:03.432 --> 14:06.302
I see you older.

14:06.335 --> 14:09.505
Can you see it?

14:09.538 --> 14:10.573
No.

14:10.606 --> 14:12.608
Sure you can.

14:12.641 --> 14:16.912
You can see tomorrow.

14:16.945 --> 14:20.749
You imagine yourself
in tomorrow...

14:20.783 --> 14:22.385
And there you are.

14:28.524 --> 14:31.560
You can do that.

14:31.594 --> 14:34.930
Look.

14:34.963 --> 14:37.733
Okay.

14:37.766 --> 14:40.303
Do you know the guys
who did this to you?

14:40.336 --> 14:41.604
Mm.

14:41.637 --> 14:44.207
They were looking
for your father?

14:44.240 --> 14:45.341
Yes.

14:45.374 --> 14:46.809
Hmm.

14:46.842 --> 14:49.578
Did you tell them where he was?

14:49.612 --> 14:51.947
I don't know where he is.

14:51.980 --> 14:54.883
He's been gone since yesterday.

14:54.917 --> 14:57.553

[Wincing]

15:04.827 --> 15:05.961
Shh, shh.

15:05.994 --> 15:09.265
I didn't call you.

15:09.298 --> 15:11.367
They cut the lines.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.335
Why are you here?

15:12.368 --> 15:14.237
Came here to be with you.

15:14.270 --> 15:16.305
Hmm?

15:16.339 --> 15:18.774
Be with you while you were
waiting for the ambulance.

15:18.807 --> 15:20.309
So you didn't have to be alone.

15:22.611 --> 15:24.280
I don't know you, do I?

15:24.313 --> 15:25.281
No.

15:25.314 --> 15:29.285
You don't know me.

15:29.318 --> 15:33.856
Can I see my daddy?

15:33.889 --> 15:38.261
Can you do that for me?

15:38.294 --> 15:39.762
Can you turn that
back on, please?

15:47.470 --> 15:49.338
I made this tape.

15:49.372 --> 15:50.639
The fire is now.

15:50.673 --> 15:54.243
I made this so...

15:54.277 --> 16:00.015
I could still watch him
when he went away.

16:00.048 --> 16:02.451
For we burn every day
we are not right!

16:02.485 --> 16:03.852
[Cell phone ringing]

16:03.886 --> 16:04.920

No, this isn't Reese.

16:07.423 --> 16:08.624
Who is this?

16:08.657 --> 16:10.493
It's Kyle Hollis,
Detective Crews.

16:10.526 --> 16:12.528
I hear you been looking for me.

16:17.366 --> 16:20.569
The fire is not
some distant image.

16:20.603 --> 16:22.571
The fire is now.

16:22.605 --> 16:24.307
I'm in your house, Kyle.

16:24.340 --> 16:25.308
What the hell
are you doing there?

16:25.341 --> 16:26.742
I was looking for you.

16:26.775 --> 16:29.445
I wasn't the first person
to get here, you understand?

16:29.478 --> 16:31.614
Somebody else got here.

16:31.647 --> 16:33.549
How is she?

16:33.582 --> 16:35.451
She's gonna be okay.

16:35.784 --> 16:36.752
Where are you?

16:36.785 --> 16:38.186
I'm in trouble,
that's where I am.

16:38.220 --> 16:39.888
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

16:39.922 --> 16:40.923
I'll bet you are.

16:40.956 --> 16:41.990
They all want me dead.

16:42.024 --> 16:44.026
Why'd you call me?

16:44.059 --> 16:45.928
You have money,
you have a badge,

16:45.961 --> 16:46.929
you can get me out
of L.A.

16:46.962 --> 16:50.699
Meet me at the Bank
of Los Angeles in two hours.

16:50.733 --> 16:51.810
You know which branch, right?

16:58.106 --> 16:59.842
You're gonna be okay.

17:09.151 --> 17:10.328
Are you allergic
to any medications?

17:10.352 --> 17:11.820
Gimme some abdominal dressings,

17:11.854 --> 17:14.623
two large Bore IVs,
and get some fluids on board.

You called my dad Kyle.

called him.

18:14.482 --> 18:16.919
We are looking
for a Burmese python.

18:16.952 --> 18:18.120
Its name is Cato.

18:18.153 --> 18:20.823
It is a constrictor.

18:20.856 --> 18:22.390
It is not venomous.

18:22.424 --> 18:24.226
Try not to let it wrap itself

18:24.259 --> 18:26.028
around any of your appendages.

18:26.061 --> 18:28.330
What could a python eat?

18:28.363 --> 18:29.865
What can or what does it eat?

18:29.898 --> 18:31.133
Could it eat a gun?

18:31.166 --> 18:32.901
They don't like anything cold.

18:32.935 --> 18:34.069
Could it eat a warm gun?

18:34.102 --> 18:35.704
They're not fond of metal.

18:35.738 --> 18:38.941
What about a warm gun

18:38.974 --> 18:39.975
covered in meat sauce?

18:40.008 --> 18:43.011
Yeah.
It'd go for that.

18:50.385 --> 18:52.187
You find the gun?

18:52.220 --> 18:53.121
The wife fed it
to her pet snake.

18:53.155 --> 18:56.091
That's why she had
meat sauce on her hands.

18:56.124 --> 18:57.092

Is this the part where I ask
what it is you're doing?

19:05.500 --> 19:08.136
Probably better if you didn't.

19:15.810 --> 19:17.212

[Engine revs]

19:54.349 --> 19:55.350
This isn't some trick?

19:55.383 --> 19:59.387
The trick is to not become
attached to the car.

20:39.261 --> 20:40.428

20:42.464 --> 20:43.865
You think it's about a girl.

20:43.898 --> 20:45.833
Charlie gets lots of girls.

20:45.867 --> 20:47.902
I wouldn't know.

20:47.935 --> 20:50.405
I don't think
it was about a girl.

20:50.438 --> 20:53.275
Because now that
I think about it,

20:53.308 --> 20:54.276
kinda had that look.

20:54.309 --> 20:55.243
Oh, yeah?

20:55.277 --> 20:57.212
What look is that?

20:57.245 --> 20:59.347
A look that he was about
to do something

20:59.381 --> 21:01.349
he'd be better off not doing.

21:04.352 --> 21:05.672
Look like he had that look
to you?

saved your life in prison.

21:45.658 --> 21:47.760
How exactly did he do that?

21:47.793 --> 21:53.298
He convinced some, um... people
to leave me alone.

21:53.332 --> 21:56.869
How did he convince them?

21:56.902 --> 21:59.705
In a way that I was unable to.

21:59.739 --> 22:02.141
You mean with violence.

If Crews was set up

22:08.648 --> 22:10.650
and found the person who did it,

what do you think he would do?

22:14.386 --> 22:16.288
What would you do?

22:18.390 --> 22:20.125
Too bad you can't kill me.

22:21.794 --> 22:23.195

I used to think
none of us were alone.

22:25.030 --> 22:26.331
Now I'm not so sure.

22:26.365 --> 22:28.133
What's that supposed to mean?

22:28.167 --> 22:30.135
It means I came alone, Kyle.

22:30.169 --> 22:32.404
You surprised I called you?

22:32.437 --> 22:34.273
I made you call me, Kyle.

Yeah?

22:36.041 --> 22:37.076
How'd you do that?

22:37.109 --> 22:39.078
I squeezed Carl Ames.

22:39.111 --> 22:42.682
Ames squeezed Jack Reese,
and out popped you.

kinda look like.

Now... I, uh,

all sorts of information

24:23.348 --> 24:25.217
Questions you think I wanna ask.

24:25.250 --> 24:28.788
But that's not important,
because...

24:28.821 --> 24:32.424
Today...

24:32.457 --> 24:35.861
I have only one decision
to make.

You shouldn't have killed
my friends, Kyle.

26:05.250 --> 26:06.318
Once.

26:06.351 --> 26:11.090
Is he a different man than
the one who went to prison?

26:11.123 --> 26:14.126
I couldn't tell you
who he is now.

26:16.628 --> 26:19.631
Thanks for coming, Jennifer.

26:19.664 --> 26:22.034
Well, if I didn't,
you'd pull my husband over

26:22.067 --> 26:27.106
or leave a horse on my lawn,
right?

26:27.139 --> 26:28.440
I wanna ask you something.

26:28.473 --> 26:31.877
[Sighs]
What, Charlie?

What could you possibly
want to ask me?

26:33.979 --> 26:37.249
I want to ask you
for your forgiveness.

26:37.282 --> 26:41.386
All that time I was in prison,
I was angry.

26:41.420 --> 26:44.289
I was angry at you.

26:44.323 --> 26:47.226
But we were so young
when it happened.

26:47.259 --> 26:52.231
You were so young.

26:52.264 --> 26:53.632
Anyone would've done
what you did.

26:53.665 --> 26:54.967
Charlie--

26:55.000 --> 27:00.906
let me finish.

27:00.940 --> 27:02.374
I was angry at the wrong person,

27:02.407 --> 27:05.610
and now I'm asking
for your forgiveness.
