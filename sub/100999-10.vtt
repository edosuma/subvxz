00:01.710 --> 00:03.820
What was the point of killing
Partridge and setting up Gordon

00:03.820 --> 00:05.296
if I'm not free to live my life?

00:05.480 --> 00:08.113
Tell me what I need to
do to be done and I'll do it.

00:08.113 --> 00:09.190
Isn't it obvious?

00:09.269 --> 00:11.880
Neither one of us will be
safe until he's eliminated.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.406
You look like a corpse.

00:13.406 --> 00:16.226
You would already be dead
if I hadn't helped you.

00:16.273 --> 00:18.914
I'm done listening to you.
- Then listen to yourself.

00:18.939 --> 00:21.509
You would already be dead
if I hadn't helped you.

00:21.562 --> 00:24.827
If you don't help us then this goes
to the Russian embassy in 24 hours.

00:24.851 --> 00:25.336
How?

00:25.360 --> 00:27.520
We lure Volk to a secure location..

00:27.640 --> 00:30.048
..we kidnap him and then we force
the identity of the mole out of him..

00:30.048 --> 00:31.728
..by any means necessary.

00:32.255 --> 00:33.849
Turner's blackmailing me.

00:33.874 --> 00:36.216
He wants me to lure you into a trap.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.068
Drop the charges.

00:37.068 --> 00:38.496
This is a terrible time, Mae.

00:38.520 --> 00:41.301
You found out that I spoke to Senator
Thrush and you had him arrested?

00:41.341 --> 00:43.028
Mae! I deeply regret it.

00:43.060 --> 00:44.724
I'm so sorry you had to hear that.

00:44.755 --> 00:48.021
So, all the horrible shit I've read
about you online, it's...it's all true.

00:48.120 --> 00:50.385
I don't have Mr.Abbott
for you right now Ms.Larkin.

00:50.401 --> 00:52.736
Tell him I know he planted the Piper story.

00:52.760 --> 00:55.590
Why would Mr.Abbott leak a
story that makes us look bad...

00:55.590 --> 00:57.206
and you and your department look good?

00:57.280 --> 00:59.520
That's the part that fucking scares me.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.800
Gordon, come on.
Breathe!

01:01.920 --> 01:04.760
You really think you can trust this
woman to betray her own people?

01:04.879 --> 01:07.960
I don't have a choice.
But neither does she.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.200
I will do what you asked.
Stay by the phone. I'll be in touch.

01:12.328 --> 01:13.570
Where the fuck have you been?

01:13.570 --> 01:15.250
I got played.
- By who?

01:15.288 --> 01:16.768
Reuel, and the Russians.

01:16.880 --> 01:19.240
Phoenix is â€‹â€‹fucking gone.
Probably dead.

01:19.360 --> 01:23.080
Give Phoenix time.
She'll reach out when she feels she can.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.120
I said 'she', didn't I?

01:25.309 --> 01:26.989
What the fuck, Trace?

01:32.600 --> 01:33.913
I got a safe house.

01:33.913 --> 01:36.545
It's not really a safe
house, but it'll work.

01:37.080 --> 01:39.000
Okay, let's do it.

02:33.160 --> 02:35.200
You're a good friend, Trace.

06:20.200 --> 06:25.240
I'm at the house. They're not
here yet. Guess I'll get cosy.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.560
What did he say?

06:49.800 --> 06:52.320
I didn't know we were
playing hide and seek.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.800
He gave me an address.
- So?

06:56.896 --> 06:59.443
That's all.

06:59.443 --> 07:05.685
He got you into a metal concert
to give you an address?

07:05.840 --> 07:09.040
It was more punk.
- But why?

07:09.160 --> 07:14.880
Perhaps he was afraid of being
trapped in a more public place.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.640
Or he didn't want me to hear
what he said to you.

07:18.760 --> 07:21.040
Or he doesn't want you to trust me.

07:21.160 --> 07:26.200
If you can't understand us, you
might think we're on to something.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.880
Then the man is a real genius.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.400
After you...

07:50.880 --> 07:52.400
How's the patient doing?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.585
He has to stay off
that leg for a week.

07:58.085 --> 07:59.585
If it was some other week...

08:02.840 --> 08:06.080
You should quit.
You'll live longer.

08:06.171 --> 08:09.640
What about all those suckers
who quit and then die young?

08:15.600 --> 08:17.794
Is that something
you're worried about?

08:20.120 --> 08:21.480
Dying young?

08:23.560 --> 08:25.156
My father died young.

08:25.977 --> 08:28.054
Well, he was with the CIA.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.679
I think I understand
what happened to Sam.

08:48.376 --> 08:53.400
You can become so single-minded...

08:54.840 --> 08:57.680
in the defense of your own principles...

08:57.800 --> 08:59.640
that you forget to follow them.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.200
I can see how Sam
lost himself to that.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.520
And what about you?

09:11.760 --> 09:13.596
Have you lost yourself?

09:14.550 --> 09:16.299
I check now and then,
but not yet.

09:19.840 --> 09:22.300
I don't know what you
and Trace are doing,

09:22.715 --> 09:25.048
but please take
care of each other.

09:31.080 --> 09:32.440
Go on...

09:34.520 --> 09:35.962
Don't tell anybody.

09:36.369 --> 09:38.040
I'm good at keeping secrets.

10:05.596 --> 10:06.800
You ready?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.176
How you feeling?

10:30.176 --> 10:32.243
Like the cheese in a mousetrap.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.203
Makes two of us.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.880
Hi, Paula.

10:54.360 --> 10:55.800
No, I didn't.

11:23.518 --> 11:24.800
Eva?

11:39.360 --> 11:41.240
I am so sorry.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.788
I don't know what
I'm gonna do.

12:34.960 --> 12:37.680
So this is a CIA safe house.

12:37.800 --> 12:42.040
No. We still don't know who the
mole is so we can't trust the Agency.

12:45.309 --> 12:46.760
So who lives here?

12:47.840 --> 12:51.400
No-one. The owner died
last week. No family.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.160
Wait.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.983
I've been watching
the place all night.

13:19.983 --> 13:21.983
They're inside. They're alone.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.640
Who was that?

13:26.760 --> 13:30.760
Someone I asked to come
earlier, for my safety.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.280
You mean our safety.

13:35.240 --> 13:38.000
Yes, that's what I meant.

13:59.280 --> 14:02.560
He said they're in there alone.

14:02.680 --> 14:04.280
What are we waiting for?

14:10.560 --> 14:13.400
Did you think I would
let you do this alone?

15:14.680 --> 15:16.040
The coast is clear.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.840
The house is empty.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.320
There's nobody there.

15:22.560 --> 15:24.520
You are a very good liar.

15:24.640 --> 15:27.280
If you were betrayed,
it wasn't by me.

15:27.400 --> 15:31.120
It is especially clever how
you make me believe you.

15:37.880 --> 15:39.480
We need to hurry.

15:59.440 --> 16:04.479
So, all the horrible shit I've read
about you on the web, it's all true.

16:22.320 --> 16:25.155
Joe, he's coming to.

16:43.320 --> 16:48.030
I remember you.
Obviously, you know who I am.

16:51.462 --> 16:53.049
Or at least you think you do.

16:53.074 --> 16:54.856
I used to know myself, too.

16:54.887 --> 16:58.771
Things that I was
and wasn't capable of.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.452
Torturing someone
for information..

17:01.468 --> 17:02.608
..or for any reason, really.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.147
was something that would
have fallen under the heading

17:04.147 --> 17:06.650
of things that I could
not imagine myself doing.

17:07.839 --> 17:10.359
Or being a part of.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.367
The trick is to get yourself
there a little at a time .

17:17.839 --> 17:21.800
To ask yourself, "Where is the
line that I simply will not cross?"

17:23.760 --> 17:25.400
And then you move it.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.319
Just a little.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.301
And then you just move it again.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.466
And then you move it again..

17:36.040 --> 17:38.680
..and again..
.. and again..

17:38.800 --> 17:42.200
Until you barely even recognize
the person you used to be.

17:44.280 --> 17:47.800
So. Who is your mole?

17:54.200 --> 17:56.280
So she chose you?

17:57.840 --> 17:59.680
Dirty whore.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.320
I think he is jealous.

18:07.960 --> 18:11.600
Maybe he saw you take
my cock in your mouth.

18:17.421 --> 18:20.240
The key in this business
is emotional detachment

18:21.640 --> 18:25.400
One must prepare oneself
for the possibility of betrayal.

18:26.400 --> 18:30.240
I liked her, but she's a fucking
whore, so it's just business.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.360
That's all it can be with
a whore. All it can be...

18:36.040 --> 18:38.280
Maybe we are all whores.

18:38.400 --> 18:42.640
It is a rare individual who maintain
their honor in this profession.

18:44.575 --> 18:45.919
This is a fucking circus.

18:45.919 --> 18:47.816
Yeah, I know. Let me try
something. Two minutes.

18:47.840 --> 18:52.800
Your uncle, for example.
He was given a choice that night.

18:52.920 --> 18:57.880
Not by me, of course, but by the
man you are so interested to find.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.765
Bob was told it could look like
a suicide or a home invasion.

19:03.320 --> 19:07.880
But for a home invasion, his wife
would have to be killed, as well.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.960
Your uncle chose honorably.

19:27.240 --> 19:31.160
Joe, that's enough, that's enough...
- Fuck off!

19:33.440 --> 19:36.680
Don't touch me.
- Take a minute...

19:53.455 --> 19:54.752
Are you all right?

19:54.777 --> 19:57.376
What the fuck were you doing?
You're supposed to have my back.

19:57.400 --> 20:00.160
I do have your back.
It just has to look good.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.000
This was not our plan.

20:04.080 --> 20:08.160
This is a new plan, where
we both get what we want.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.143
This is a fucking mess.
- Yeah, I know.

20:22.143 --> 20:23.896
We have to shut this down.
He's not going to break.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.570
Not like this, he won't.

20:25.570 --> 20:28.770
He is trained to withstand
much more than a beating.

20:29.103 --> 20:31.383
So what do you want us to do?

20:31.408 --> 20:32.587
Chop off his fingers

20:32.596 --> 20:35.456
and when you run out of fingers,
you use your imagination.

20:35.480 --> 20:37.080
What are you talking about?

20:38.560 --> 20:39.960
Where are you going?

20:41.560 --> 20:43.000
He needs water.

20:43.120 --> 20:46.680
We are torturing him.
- I know how it works.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.480
Brute force is not working.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.143
I'm gonna try a
different approach.

20:54.143 --> 20:55.143
Let her try.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.280
Water?
- No.

21:27.960 --> 21:31.160
I was afraid
you would trick me.

21:31.280 --> 21:36.040
I prepared for it,
and yet you did it.

21:36.160 --> 21:39.553
Tell me.
How did you do it?

21:40.320 --> 21:45.200
By not knowing what I was going to do
until the moment arrived.

21:45.320 --> 21:47.560
By just being true to myself.

21:48.520 --> 21:50.720
You could do that too.

21:50.840 --> 21:54.160
Adapt to the circumstances
and make sure you survive.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.440
They'll make a deal with you.

21:59.160 --> 22:02.000
Cigarette?
- Go ahead.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.080
I won't bite you.

22:21.200 --> 22:24.240
First I am betrayed
by my best friend.

22:24.360 --> 22:27.960
Then by a woman
for whom I had feelings.

22:29.360 --> 22:32.120
I fell for it again.

22:34.360 --> 22:36.680
I haven't been playing
a game with you.

22:37.950 --> 22:40.955
My feelings for you are real.

22:40.955 --> 22:45.087
But I think it's too late for that now.

22:48.880 --> 22:52.200
My grandfather was in Germany
during the occupation..

22:52.320 --> 22:55.440
after the Great Patriotic War.

22:55.560 --> 22:57.840
He fell for a German beauty.

22:57.960 --> 23:03.120
They had a child
and she also fell for him.

23:04.120 --> 23:07.600
In that order.

23:09.320 --> 23:13.360
At the start of their relationship
the love came from one side.

23:14.520 --> 23:19.654
But pure love
defies logic..

23:19.771 --> 23:23.720
and all other considerations.

23:26.440 --> 23:31.840
If I saw a future for us
I would tell them everything.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.600
I'm tired of it, Katya.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.880
Darling...darling...

24:06.088 --> 24:09.880
Who is it? Who is it?
Tell me. Who is it?

24:10.000 --> 24:12.240
Tell me who it is. Who is it?

24:12.360 --> 24:13.720
He's dead.

24:19.720 --> 24:21.080
Piece of shit.

25:27.400 --> 25:30.600
Sorry. I rang the bell.
- Carla.

25:30.815 --> 25:32.501
I just came from
the Director's office.

25:32.501 --> 25:36.095
Nobody above GS15 showed
up for work at the CIMC today..

25:36.120 --> 25:38.228
and you're the only
one on the seventh floor

25:38.228 --> 25:40.761
who knows the details
of the Piper investigation

25:41.160 --> 25:43.280
Now that he's dead..
- What?

25:43.408 --> 25:45.642
He killed himself in custody.

25:46.579 --> 25:48.135
Now everyone's playing catchup.

25:48.160 --> 25:48.994
Why?

25:49.603 --> 25:50.896
Because a CIA officer...

25:50.927 --> 25:52.713
No. Why did he kill himself?

25:53.781 --> 25:55.944
I imagine being a captured
Russian double-agent..

25:55.969 --> 25:58.982
But he was innocent.
- I'm sorry?

25:58.982 --> 26:00.582
He wasn't the mole.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.659
How could you know that?

26:02.659 --> 26:04.893
Because I was in Bob's office
the night that he was killed.

26:04.920 --> 26:06.136
And I looked inside his files.

26:06.136 --> 26:07.869
And I didn't see anything.

26:07.884 --> 26:10.985
So I knew Gordon's file must
have been planted afterwards.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.057
Why didn't you say anything?

26:14.628 --> 26:16.828
I wanted to sabotage Robin Larkin.

26:19.680 --> 26:23.880
You.. you knew there was
still a mole in the Agency

26:24.000 --> 26:26.258
who could be hurting
and killing our own people,

26:26.258 --> 26:29.458
and you didn't say anything
because of a vendetta?

26:32.247 --> 26:36.243
I think I made a wrong turn a
long time ago and I've been..

26:36.480 --> 26:38.520
and I've been
picking up ever since.

26:43.103 --> 26:45.124
I fear that I'm...

26:46.992 --> 26:48.672
terribly, terribly lost.

26:55.520 --> 26:58.600
I see your wound is already
healing, comrade.

26:58.720 --> 27:01.640
I have some questions for you
about that day.

27:03.600 --> 27:05.560
How did you end up at that lake?

27:06.520 --> 27:09.560
People traced Sirin
to a remote house.

27:09.680 --> 27:14.200
We lured Arkady Volk to the house
in order to separate him from his team.

27:14.320 --> 27:15.667
To get him alone?

27:15.667 --> 27:17.736
He wasn't alone. There
was a woman with him.

27:17.760 --> 27:19.120
We took them by force.

27:19.240 --> 27:21.520
It was a trap.
They were waiting for us.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.080
The woman escaped.

27:23.200 --> 27:26.520
I escaped.
- How?

27:26.640 --> 27:29.160
They were torturing people.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.240
We don't torture people.

27:33.960 --> 27:37.000
Did he give up the
informant's name?

27:37.120 --> 27:38.067
No.

27:39.223 --> 27:43.355
Would he have
broken under pressure?

27:43.920 --> 27:46.040
No, I don't think so.

27:47.120 --> 27:50.600
Where was Robin
Larkin in all of this?

27:50.743 --> 27:53.478
I haven't seen her since
before Gordon's arrest.

27:53.509 --> 27:57.640
I mean, where do you think
her disappearance fits in?

27:58.760 --> 28:01.520
I assume she was killed
to protect the mole.

28:01.640 --> 28:05.000
But she disappeared
after Piper was in custody.

28:05.120 --> 28:10.240
Unless you have reason to
suspect Piper wasn't the mole.

28:11.360 --> 28:13.680
I think he was set up.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.600
I just don't know who
the actual mole is.

28:24.257 --> 28:26.046
Mae?
- Hello?

28:28.073 --> 28:29.073
Hey..
- Hey.

28:34.760 --> 28:36.135
I'm glad you're okay.

28:36.135 --> 28:38.174
Yeah. I was worried when
you didn't come to the hospital.

28:38.174 --> 28:39.174
Sorry.

28:43.099 --> 28:46.895
I can't...
- Okay.

28:46.920 --> 28:48.320
Not after Gordon.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.891
I explained that.

28:51.241 --> 28:53.389
You said everything
was going to be okay.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.040
And I trusted you.

28:57.890 --> 29:00.600
I was at their home with
you when you pulled that shit.

29:02.880 --> 29:06.200
He was our friend.
- I know.

29:07.240 --> 29:09.618
You don't have all
the facts, though.

29:09.859 --> 29:10.961
No, I don't.

29:11.840 --> 29:14.080
And you can't tell me
all the facts, can you?

29:15.040 --> 29:18.240
That's exactly why I was reluctant
to go out with you in the first place.

29:19.360 --> 29:21.440
I don't want to repeat
all the mistakes.

29:22.983 --> 29:27.215
I wish you had just
one small idea ...

29:27.343 --> 29:32.543
of all the shit I've had to do to try
and make this work between us.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.320
I really wish you knew.

29:35.280 --> 29:38.880
More classified bullshit.
- Yeah, that's my fucking job.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.070
Which is exactly the problem.

29:41.680 --> 29:44.760
Maybe you should have thought
of that before you led me on.

29:46.280 --> 29:49.560
I think you led yourself on.
- Fuck you!

29:51.280 --> 29:52.640
Get out of my house.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.680
Are you fucking deaf?
- Is everything okay?

29:58.750 --> 29:59.750
Yeah!

30:00.520 --> 30:02.080
Tracy was just leaving.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.720
Goodbye, Mr. Crane.

30:11.880 --> 30:13.440
Goodbye, Mr. Crane.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.240
Is everything okay?

30:28.630 --> 30:29.630
Yeah.

30:32.680 --> 30:34.040
Sorry.

31:21.480 --> 31:24.691
I wouldn't have expected
the deputy director of the CIA

31:24.691 --> 31:27.291
to show up to the funeral of a traitor.

31:27.360 --> 31:29.883
We both know that
Gordon wasn't a traitor.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.938
The CIA knows it, too,
only they'd never admit it.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.760
I've been to a
number of funerals..

31:35.880 --> 31:39.360
for people whose deaths I
felt personally responsible..

31:39.480 --> 31:43.080
but I am determined
that this will be my last.

31:44.240 --> 31:49.040
And what if I determined
to kill you? Just to make sure?

31:49.160 --> 31:52.200
Youâ€™re getting a taste for it, Joe.
Be careful.

31:53.320 --> 31:55.781
Anyway I am retiring and I
though you might want to know

31:55.781 --> 31:58.859
that intend to make
a full confession.

31:59.491 --> 32:02.440
That's between you and your god.
It's of no interest to the rest of us.

32:04.047 --> 32:10.461
Which is why I'm planning to avail
myself of a more public forum.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.520
Take care of yourself, Joe.

33:22.327 --> 33:24.894
Capitol Hill was buzzing
today with preparations for..

33:25.000 --> 33:29.360
CIA deputy director Rueul
Abbott's much anticipated testimony.

33:29.413 --> 33:31.535
Not since William Colby
gave up the Agency's...

33:31.560 --> 33:32.375
Are you okay?

33:32.405 --> 33:36.740
...family jewels back in the 1970s
has the intelligence community...

33:36.783 --> 33:38.814
...been so on the edge of its seat.

33:38.839 --> 33:42.775
Sure to be a central focus of questioning
are the controversial allegations...

33:42.775 --> 33:46.026
made by late CIA
officer Marty Frost.

33:46.095 --> 33:50.911
If the deputy director confirms even some
of the information in the Frost dossier...

33:50.936 --> 33:52.686
...which the Agency has denied...

33:52.760 --> 33:57.160
..the ripple effects could spread throughout
the American intelligence community.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.120
For more on the Abbott testimony,
we go now to the Capitol.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.760
I won't scream.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.320
I know.

34:41.719 --> 34:45.120
Hey, how you doing?
- Reuel Abbott is dead.

34:45.806 --> 34:46.696
What?

34:46.719 --> 34:48.080
Turn on the TV.

34:52.080 --> 34:53.440
Hold on..

34:55.175 --> 34:59.274
Our sources have just confirmed that
deputy director of the CIA Reuel Abbott

34:59.299 --> 35:01.787
has been found dead
after an apparent drowning..

35:01.799 --> 35:02.939
Yeah. I'll call you back.

35:02.964 --> 35:04.876
Authorities have not yet
released any official information.

35:04.962 --> 35:07.267
Theories have already
been floated on social media..

35:07.267 --> 35:09.176
..around the suspicious
timing of the death,

35:09.200 --> 35:12.280
just ahead of Mr. Abbott's
planned testimony before Congress.

35:48.040 --> 35:49.960
Time's up, Mr. Crane.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.040
Bastards.
-Congratulations.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.960
Well deserved.
- We're going to miss you.

36:18.015 --> 36:20.295
Hey, I think I got one..

36:20.407 --> 36:21.767
Yeah!

36:22.445 --> 36:24.512
Bring him in.
Get him, get him!

36:27.040 --> 36:30.080
That's a big one.
- We can eat this guy.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.120
Looks good. We'll keep him.

36:32.240 --> 36:34.600
Look at that!
- Good!

36:34.720 --> 36:39.221
All right. I'm a fisherman.
- Well done.

36:57.880 --> 37:01.720
I'm not armed.
- You can never be too careful.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.520
Mind if I join you?

37:11.960 --> 37:13.720
Surprised to see me?

37:13.840 --> 37:16.400
No. After what we went through..

37:16.520 --> 37:19.840
..we are each a natural target
for recruitment by the other.

37:19.960 --> 37:22.606
If you hadn't approached me,
I probably would have approached you.

37:24.854 --> 37:27.949
I don't need to recruit you, Potoo.

37:28.582 --> 37:30.656
Am I supposed to
understand what that means?

37:30.680 --> 37:35.080
I recognized your voice at the lake.
I couldn't figure out from where.

37:35.175 --> 37:37.034
And then it hit me.

37:37.059 --> 37:39.496
You see, I was in the car
that night when you called Volk..

37:39.520 --> 37:42.000
to tell him that Joe Turner was
on his way to meet Vasili.

37:43.480 --> 37:46.320
You are just like me.
Playing both sides.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.720
You were a Volk's man at
the safe house, weren't you?

37:51.167 --> 37:53.127
The one who was
supposed to have his back.

37:54.080 --> 37:57.480
You untied him and you shot him,
to make yourself look like the hero.

37:59.720 --> 38:03.160
You sound as
ridiculous as a spy novel.

38:05.240 --> 38:09.160
A smart play. I would
have done the same thing.

38:12.760 --> 38:15.080
If what you're saying is true..

38:15.442 --> 38:18.560
..then wouldn't we
have dirt on each other?

38:18.680 --> 38:21.278
Don't those things just...
- Cancel each other out?

38:21.278 --> 38:23.779
Yeah.
- My thoughts exactly.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.440
Why are you here?

38:26.560 --> 38:30.240
I'm back with the SVR. I need
to make sure my secret is safe.

38:30.360 --> 38:33.000
Is it?
- I'm retired.

38:33.120 --> 38:35.920
Yeah, from the CIA.
- From everything.

38:37.560 --> 38:39.824
So you won't be filing any
new reports with Moscow?

38:39.824 --> 38:40.824
No.

38:42.960 --> 38:44.320
That's good.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.680
Have a nice life.

39:46.040 --> 39:48.400
What are you doing here?

39:48.520 --> 39:51.988
I've been thinking about this place a lot.
- Oh yeah. What about it?

39:52.600 --> 39:56.760
How long have you had it?
And how much it must have cost you.

40:01.560 --> 40:05.160
How long have you been doing this?
- What the fuck are you talking about?

40:08.120 --> 40:10.600
I'm retired.
- Yeah, from the CIA.

40:10.720 --> 40:13.120
From everything.

40:13.240 --> 40:15.445
So you won't be filing any
new reports with Moscow?

40:15.445 --> 40:16.226
No.

40:19.125 --> 40:22.160
I was playing her. I was going to recruit
her and make her my asset. That's it.

40:22.398 --> 40:23.688
Only, you were only late.

40:25.094 --> 40:26.358
She's my asset now.

40:26.725 --> 40:28.186
She's a Russian agent.

40:28.913 --> 40:30.241
You're seriously going
to believe the word of...

40:30.280 --> 40:31.366
She's very convincing.

40:32.408 --> 40:35.158
This is what they do.
And they're good at it.

40:35.322 --> 40:36.423
They did it to Gordon,
and now they're doing it...

40:36.448 --> 40:37.880
It's what you do.

40:41.080 --> 40:42.920
So you've made up
your mind, then?

40:44.537 --> 40:45.537
Yeah

40:49.960 --> 40:52.360
You're always a little out of
your depth, aren't you?

40:56.415 --> 40:59.655
People in the country
are..more trusting.

41:00.960 --> 41:04.496
They tend to leave their doors unlocked.
They don't even have alarm systems.

41:06.855 --> 41:08.909
So, you're just going
to shoot me, Joe?

41:08.909 --> 41:10.643
Isn't that what you did to Bob?

41:16.335 --> 41:19.033
You know, I told myself that I
was going to calmly tell you..

41:19.058 --> 41:20.936
..what I was going to do to you.

41:20.960 --> 41:23.320
Give you a chance to say your piece.

41:23.440 --> 41:26.720
Because I wanted you to know
that this is not an act of vengeance.

41:27.720 --> 41:29.120
It is justice.

41:31.983 --> 41:35.303
But you know what,
I was lying to myself.

41:36.640 --> 41:39.320
Because the truth is,
what I really want..

41:40.640 --> 41:44.890
..is to see that look on your face
when you realize that it is all over.

43:15.840 --> 43:20.880
I have heard stories about what happened
at the lake. Is it true?

43:21.880 --> 43:23.800
Depends what you heard.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.520
I was friends with Tracy Crane.

43:30.040 --> 43:35.160
He was one of the good guys.
It is unbelievable that he is no longer there.

43:37.047 --> 43:38.517
Do you want to
know what I heard?

43:39.017 --> 43:40.457
What did you hear?

43:41.360 --> 43:45.080
It was retribution by the
Russians for Gordon Piper.

43:45.200 --> 43:47.040
For outing their mole.

44:19.720 --> 44:24.520
A year ago this place was knee-deep
in Boko Haram and ISIS in West Africa.

44:24.640 --> 44:27.720
But we shifted focus.
It's a new game.

44:27.840 --> 44:30.560
We're playing chess with the Chinese
and Africa is the board.

44:30.680 --> 44:34.720
Half of this room is working to support
US military positions on the continent..

44:34.840 --> 44:39.040
..and the other half is trying to sabotage
the Chinese attempts to do likewise.

44:39.160 --> 44:43.480
It gets messy but it's
us or them, you know?

44:44.840 --> 44:47.840
I'm one seat over. Let me
know if you want to grab a smoke.

45:57.600 --> 46:00.480
English subtitles: BugWorx.
