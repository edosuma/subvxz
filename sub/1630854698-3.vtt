00:10.970 --> 00:15.015
Hello. My name is Chava.

00:16.142 --> 00:17.143
This here is Georges,

00:17.143 --> 00:19.437
and you already know Rebecca.

00:19.437 --> 00:20.855
Rebecca?

00:22.106 --> 00:24.316
My sincere apologies

00:24.316 --> 00:27.570
for the manner by which
we had to transport you here.

00:27.570 --> 00:29.739
But you see, we couldn't
let you lot fuck this up.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.742
I think they want to speak.

00:32.742 --> 00:35.202
- Could you lower their gags?
- Yes, Ima.

00:36.829 --> 00:38.330
Us fuck this up?

00:38.330 --> 00:40.458
How could you?

00:40.458 --> 00:41.959
What do you want?

00:41.959 --> 00:44.336
Georges, could you bring
the main course, please?

00:44.336 --> 00:46.297
With pleasure, Ima.

00:55.473 --> 00:57.683
You lot were the bait.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.852
So we could
distract his handlers

00:59.852 --> 01:03.814
and get him out alive before one
of you killed him by mistake.

01:03.814 --> 01:05.733
You-you have a history
of doing that, no?

01:05.733 --> 01:07.193
What the fuck?

01:18.496 --> 01:20.456
Hallo, little birdie.

01:20.456 --> 01:22.166
Aah! Aah!

01:23.626 --> 01:25.044
Klaus.

01:25.044 --> 01:26.212
Where is Adolf Hitler?

01:26.212 --> 01:28.339
Fuck you.

01:30.341 --> 01:31.675
Rebecca.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.262
[shouting] Wait, wait!

01:35.262 --> 01:37.181
Ow... Oh, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, no!

01:37.181 --> 01:38.849
I-I don't know.
I swear, I don't know.

01:38.849 --> 01:41.477
No one goes to Hitler's haven.

01:43.229 --> 01:46.941
All right, wait, wait, wait,
except for one man. The Crow.

01:46.941 --> 01:50.194
- Who's The Crow?
- The Reich's chief assassin.

01:50.194 --> 01:52.780
The Crow's courier was
picking up the briefcase.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.074
Where was he supposed
to deliver the briefcase?

01:55.074 --> 01:56.742
I don't know. I swear...

01:56.742 --> 01:58.828
He had a key.

01:58.828 --> 02:00.788
He had a key in his pocket.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.248
The courier.

02:02.248 --> 02:03.999
I d...

02:03.999 --> 02:05.793
Can someone let me go? Come on.

02:24.353 --> 02:27.606
It's a hotel key.
Georges, find out what hotel.

02:27.606 --> 02:30.109
Let's save him for leftovers.

02:30.109 --> 02:32.194
Oh, wait, wait, no!

02:32.194 --> 02:34.280
Wait, wait, wait...

02:36.740 --> 02:38.701
She's right.

02:38.701 --> 02:40.244
- What do you mean,
she's right?
- Jonah...

02:40.244 --> 02:42.496
- We fucked up in Spain.
- No, you fucked up.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.332
She got Klaus. She got
one step closer to Hitler.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.710
If we're gonna find him,
we need numbers.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.837
We need a new team.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.380
Looks like we've found them.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.303
Untie them.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.947
Fucking traitor.

03:18.407 --> 03:20.451
We're not gonna
break bread together.

03:20.451 --> 03:23.162
We're not gonna
hunt Nazis together.

03:23.162 --> 03:26.582
We don't partner with anyone.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.795
What that awful man
must have done to you.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.881
Meyer.

03:35.633 --> 03:37.885
But look at you.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.929
<i>Baruch Hashem.</i>

03:41.263 --> 03:42.806
I know she lives in you.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.850
Who?

03:46.185 --> 03:48.729
- Ruth.
- You...

03:50.314 --> 03:52.441
...didn't know my <i>safta.</i>

03:54.360 --> 03:55.945
Ruth was my sister.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.076
Ruth's sister died in the camps.

04:02.076 --> 04:05.496
Well... then I must be a ghost.

04:05.496 --> 04:08.707
And this must be...

04:08.707 --> 04:10.834
a ghost story.

04:20.302 --> 04:21.428
Boo!

06:27.638 --> 06:30.099
Viktor.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.686
This is not a dream.

06:34.686 --> 06:37.314
Please, take whatever you want.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.524
Oh.

06:38.524 --> 06:42.820
You-you don't
recognize me, Viktor?

06:42.820 --> 06:44.446
Hmm?

06:44.446 --> 06:47.407
Well, it's been
a long time, hmm?

06:47.407 --> 06:50.786
Here. Let me help you here.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.083
Put them on.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.551
- It's you.
- Me.

07:05.551 --> 07:10.013
Fritz said I could
find you here.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.432
Yeah. You know him.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.560
He was easy to deal with.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.563
But you, I don't know.

07:17.563 --> 07:21.942
What will we do
about you, Viktor, hmm?

07:26.196 --> 07:28.699
How did you sur... survive...
how did you survive the camps?

07:28.699 --> 07:31.285
Come on, I-I know
a con when I see one.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.328
We're not working with her.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.622
- You're making a mistake.
- You! Not another word

07:35.622 --> 07:38.041
- out of you, traitor!
- What street did
you grow up on?

07:38.041 --> 07:40.002
Szczebrzeska.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.796
- Okay, your father's name?
- Abraham.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.174
My mother Fruma.

07:45.174 --> 07:47.176
- How about your...
- Porja?

07:47.176 --> 07:49.636
Porja was our cat.

07:49.636 --> 07:53.056
Ruth had a long scar on her arm

07:53.056 --> 07:54.975
from that fucking cat.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.565
She-she loved thunderstorms

08:01.565 --> 08:03.317
and the smell of

08:03.317 --> 08:06.904
- Lavender.
- lavender. And she was funny.

08:06.904 --> 08:09.281
And brilliant.

08:09.281 --> 08:11.366
Pain in the ass.

08:12.743 --> 08:15.871
And my protector.

08:15.871 --> 08:19.875
And I loved every bit
of my big sister.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.839
I see the "pain in the ass" bit
rubbed off on you.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.424
If you thought
we'd fuck tonight up,

08:27.424 --> 08:28.842
why do you want to work with us?

08:28.842 --> 08:32.387
Because once there were 20 of us
and now there are three.

08:32.387 --> 08:36.308
Because the few who care
are old and dying.

08:36.308 --> 08:38.227
Pickings are slim.

08:38.227 --> 08:40.938
At least you're family.

08:40.938 --> 08:44.233
If we want to get to Adolf
before nature does,

08:44.233 --> 08:46.485
we need to work together.

08:56.411 --> 08:58.163
Merci.

09:00.082 --> 09:02.251
Klaus said that The Crow
is Hitler's only connection

09:02.251 --> 09:03.752
to the outside world.

09:03.752 --> 09:04.962
And that the bald man...

09:04.962 --> 09:06.171
Is supposed to bring
this briefcase

09:06.171 --> 09:08.006
to The Crow.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.675
At some hotel.

09:09.675 --> 09:11.301
It's not just
some hotel.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.763
It's the famed La Abadia.

09:14.763 --> 09:15.847
A former monastery.

09:15.847 --> 09:18.850
Even monks sell out
to hotel developers.

09:21.353 --> 09:24.690
So, we go to the hotel
in the bald man's stead,

09:24.690 --> 09:28.318
plant the briefcase, lure
The Crow out from the shadows.

09:28.318 --> 09:31.780
Cage The Crow and force him
to lead us to Hitler.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.667
<i>The hotel is a hotbed</i>

09:43.667 --> 09:45.961
<i>of international
criminals and thieves.</i>

09:45.961 --> 09:50.674
<i>The Nazis have used it before,
and they have eyes everywhere.</i>

09:50.674 --> 09:53.302
<i>We must be invisible.</i>

09:56.555 --> 10:00.267
<i>We have this evening to catch
The Crow and make him sing.</i>

10:00.267 --> 10:03.979
<i>And this evening only.</i>

10:06.982 --> 10:09.860
<i>Mindy, you will
take the hotel key</i>

10:09.860 --> 10:11.737
<i>and get into the courier's room.</i>

10:11.737 --> 10:13.905
<i>There, you will decipher
where the meeting</i>

10:13.905 --> 10:15.991
<i>with The Crow is meant to be.</i>

10:23.707 --> 10:25.751
-  <i>Reception.</i>
- Yes, hello.

10:25.751 --> 10:28.086
The-the light was blinking?

10:28.086 --> 10:30.839
<i>You have a reservation for two
at 7:00 p.m. tonight.</i>

10:30.839 --> 10:34.384
<i>Once she does,
Jonah and I will be there,</i>

10:34.384 --> 10:36.803
<i>lying in wait for him.</i>

10:38.638 --> 10:40.098
<i>Lonny and Georges will stay
with the briefcase,</i>

10:40.098 --> 10:42.184
<i>no matter what.</i>

10:42.184 --> 10:46.188
<i>And ladies,
you must have our backs.</i>

10:46.188 --> 10:47.939
We start on the bottom floor,
we make our way up.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.358
The Crow will have eyes everywhere.

10:49.358 --> 10:50.984
He never travels
without his murder,

10:50.984 --> 10:54.196
so we take them out,
we leave him unprotected.

10:54.196 --> 10:55.906
Kitchen's clear.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.407
<i>This is Clara.</i>

10:57.407 --> 10:58.950
-  <i>And Sam.</i>
-  <i>Leave us a message.</i>

10:58.950 --> 11:01.119
<i>I'm sorry
I didn't call till now.</i>

11:01.119 --> 11:02.829
<i>I was in the archives till late.</i>

11:02.829 --> 11:04.748
I'll call you in the morning.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.918
I love you.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.671
Can't wait to be home.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.050
Goose.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.302
Quail. Duck.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.139
But no Crow.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.515
Don't you think The Crow

12:03.515 --> 12:05.434
will see the briefcase
all alone, grow suspicious?

12:05.434 --> 12:07.310
He won't be the one
who picks up the briefcase.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.396
He'll send one of his thugs.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.231
Oh, but he's here, watching it.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.568
He could be anyone.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.778
Oh, they have lamb!

12:16.778 --> 12:17.988
- Do you like lamb?
- Yeah, I could give

12:17.988 --> 12:19.239
two sh-shits about lamb.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.074
Not thinking
about food right now.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.784
That is our cover.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.579
We are at dinner. You will dine.

12:25.579 --> 12:28.498
I-I'm not taking orders
from you, Auntie.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.917
Remember, the only reason
why we're here right now

12:30.917 --> 12:32.794
is because I found Klaus.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.088
Oh, right.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.257
You're Herr Leader now.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.385
You murdered Meyer
to become boy king.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.845
I murdered The Wolf

12:41.845 --> 12:43.930
and thwarted a Fourth Reich
in America.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.599
And what happened in Spain?

12:45.599 --> 12:47.225
Hmm? What happened there?

12:47.225 --> 12:49.311
Why did your little army
desert you?

12:51.730 --> 12:55.066
You want to be in charge
of this hunt, boy?

12:55.066 --> 12:58.570
Why don't we settle it
with a bet.

13:00.155 --> 13:03.992
One of these diners is our Crow.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.913
Whoever picks him correctly

13:07.913 --> 13:10.207
wears the crown.

13:10.207 --> 13:13.084
Loser buys dinner.

13:13.084 --> 13:16.254
Great. I'll order the Dom,
then, since you're paying.

13:16.254 --> 13:19.174
Splendid. I love a wager.

13:21.426 --> 13:22.844
<i></i> Side Order
of Vengeance?

13:22.844 --> 13:24.930
- No.
<i>- Toledo Connection?</i>

13:24.930 --> 13:27.265
- No.
- <i>Stranger in Danger 2?</i>

13:27.265 --> 13:29.059
<i>Far Out Down Under?</i>

13:29.059 --> 13:30.602
<i>Bonkers in Yonkers?</i>

13:30.602 --> 13:32.938
<i>Young Man: The YMCA Story?</i>

13:32.938 --> 13:34.272
No?

13:34.272 --> 13:36.441
<i>Meet Me in Poughkeepsie?
Vera vs. Verne?</i>

13:36.441 --> 13:37.609
<i>The 33 Sparrows?</i>

13:37.609 --> 13:39.945
I haven't seen
your films, Lonny.

13:39.945 --> 13:41.696
She loved <i>The 33 Sparrows.</i>

13:41.696 --> 13:44.950
It was her favorite
of the Flash oeuvre.

13:44.950 --> 13:47.452
She laughed
the whole time.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.872
It's a tuberculosis drama.

13:51.873 --> 13:53.333
Who's she?

13:53.333 --> 13:55.085
Roxy.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.836
Roxy and you?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.755
You were a fling?

13:58.755 --> 14:02.050
Were. Are. Who's to say?

14:03.552 --> 14:05.470
Were.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.973
Very much were.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.726
Lonny, maybe
don't drink so much.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.812
I'm fine. Jesus.

14:15.397 --> 14:18.692
What do you do for fun?
Besides not drink at bars.

14:20.151 --> 14:21.861
What are you doing?

14:30.078 --> 14:32.080
Like your movie, eh?

14:32.080 --> 14:34.416
A sparrow.

14:34.416 --> 14:37.377
I do magic for fun.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.549
Well, this is gonna be
a long fucking night.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.303
Cover me, Pierre.
I need <i>el baño.</i>

15:53.745 --> 15:55.747
<i>I'm told
one of your works</i>

15:55.747 --> 15:58.041
<i>is hanging
in the Palais Bourbon.</i>

15:58.041 --> 16:01.419
- A van Gogh.
- Yeah, business is good.

16:02.504 --> 16:04.422
And Malika?

16:05.882 --> 16:09.386
Did you ever complicate
a mission or steal a lead

16:09.386 --> 16:12.180
or put us in danger for her?
For Chava?

16:12.180 --> 16:14.474
- Never. It wasn't like that.
- I let you in.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.726
Against my better
fucking judgment,

16:16.726 --> 16:19.270
I let you in. I told you
everything about Lonny.

16:19.270 --> 16:22.148
About Joe.
About my sister. About me.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.817
You-you read Malika books.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.568
You took her to the zoo.
She fucking loved you.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.278
- Rox, I...
- And all of that...

16:31.366 --> 16:35.412
All of that, I can see past.

16:35.412 --> 16:37.580
But the one thing I can't?

16:37.580 --> 16:40.417
You could've told Ruth that
her baby sister survived,

16:40.417 --> 16:44.546
and you didn't.
And I cannot understand why.

16:46.631 --> 16:49.467
Because it wasn't
my truth to tell.

16:50.552 --> 16:53.054
Truth doesn't have an owner.

16:54.139 --> 16:55.014
Hey.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.226
We good?

16:59.227 --> 17:00.562
- Yes.
- Yeah.

17:00.562 --> 17:03.481
Okay, next floor.

17:40.643 --> 17:42.729
Oh...

17:52.822 --> 17:55.283
He's wearing a Bulova watch.
Designed in Queens.

17:55.283 --> 17:58.036
Nazi wouldn't trust
an American timepiece.

17:58.036 --> 17:59.329
The bloke to your right.

17:59.329 --> 18:02.749
He's had six glasses of wine.
Our assassin

18:02.749 --> 18:04.417
- would keep his wits.
- You said The Crow

18:04.417 --> 18:06.544
first trained as a sharpshooter?

18:06.544 --> 18:08.379
Snipers need to control
their breathing.

18:08.379 --> 18:10.882
Guy behind me
has an asthma inhaler.

18:12.383 --> 18:14.302
The woman
with the bump on her arm?

18:14.302 --> 18:16.387
Smallpox vaccine.

18:16.387 --> 18:19.390
Nazis distrusted vaccines
because Jewish scientists

18:19.390 --> 18:20.683
helped develop them.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.602
That woman over there?

18:22.602 --> 18:24.854
The big Agatha Christie fan?

18:24.854 --> 18:26.689
An assassin reading

18:26.689 --> 18:29.234
about Miss Marple's
a bit on the nose.

18:29.234 --> 18:30.985
Low-hanging fruit.

18:30.985 --> 18:34.656
Since I'm playing your game,
how about you play mine?

18:36.074 --> 18:38.409
My <i>safta</i> said you were dead.

18:38.409 --> 18:41.830
How are you sitting here
across from me?

18:43.498 --> 18:45.375
There was a prisoner,

18:45.375 --> 18:47.126
a Jew,

18:47.126 --> 18:49.045
ordered to kill me.

18:49.045 --> 18:52.549
But this man, he-he turned
the blade on his own throat.

18:52.549 --> 18:55.385
An act of defiance.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.136
And it was a spark.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.390
We turned on the guards,
tried to overpower them.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.726
I escaped.

19:03.726 --> 19:06.771
I-I ran.

19:06.771 --> 19:10.567
I ran for seven nights.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.528
Until I ran home.

19:13.528 --> 19:16.990
A Nazi officer and his wife
had moved in.

19:18.992 --> 19:22.120
And something in me...

19:22.120 --> 19:23.621
snapped.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.333
They were my first.

19:29.419 --> 19:32.881
I was only 16.

19:32.881 --> 19:35.925
I left such a mess.

19:35.925 --> 19:39.554
Thank God I didn't get caught.

19:39.554 --> 19:42.098
But I'd soon learn
how important it is

19:42.098 --> 19:45.018
to be neat.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.604
Untraceable.

19:47.604 --> 19:51.232
As all good killers must be.

19:51.232 --> 19:52.567
Which rules out

19:52.567 --> 19:53.735
the gentleman to your right.

19:53.735 --> 19:57.447
Spots of rémoulade on his shirt.

19:57.447 --> 20:00.450
And the three slobs behind me.

20:00.450 --> 20:03.369
Ketchup, wine, oil.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.582
Why didn't you...

20:09.000 --> 20:12.545
Why didn't you reach out
to my <i>safta</i> after the war?

20:12.545 --> 20:14.672
- I thought she was dead.
- Did you even...

20:14.672 --> 20:15.924
did you even try
to look for her?

20:15.924 --> 20:17.884
- Of course.
- And?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.636
- It's not that simple, Jonah.
- What?

20:19.636 --> 20:21.930
- It seems that simple to me.
- How could you know?!

20:25.391 --> 20:26.559
Señora.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.519
Gracias.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.356
De nada.

20:39.656 --> 20:42.533
Room 317. Far end of the hall.

20:42.533 --> 20:46.412
- Are you certain?
- Yes, I'm bloody certain.
Let's go.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.331
No. You stay here
by the elevator.

20:48.331 --> 20:50.375
In case we miss him.

20:52.835 --> 20:55.213
She doesn't have
what it takes anymore.

21:20.488 --> 21:22.407
[whispers] That's him.

22:04.323 --> 22:08.077
Harriet!

22:10.163 --> 22:11.914
Aah!

23:04.050 --> 23:05.968
We got to run.

23:05.968 --> 23:08.304
<i>Who else knows?</i>

23:08.304 --> 23:10.973
You came to me, huh?

23:10.973 --> 23:12.850
You remember?

23:12.850 --> 23:14.602
How could I forget?

23:14.602 --> 23:17.980
You begged on your knees, Herr.
Like a dog.

23:17.980 --> 23:21.109
- Who else knows about me?
- I got you out.

23:21.109 --> 23:22.944
No one.

23:22.944 --> 23:25.196
I swear, Wilhelm.

23:25.196 --> 23:27.281
Wilhelm.

23:28.866 --> 23:32.036
What, you think
you're talking to Wilhelm?

23:32.036 --> 23:34.122
No.

23:35.123 --> 23:38.417
I am the pale horse of death,

23:38.417 --> 23:41.754
and apocalypse follows me.

23:42.755 --> 23:45.049
I am Samael,

23:45.049 --> 23:49.262
who rips the soul
from the body of man.

23:49.262 --> 23:53.724
I am the severity
of God himself.

24:01.816 --> 24:04.485
I'm here for my file.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.966
How many?

24:26.966 --> 24:30.970
How many did you escape?

24:30.970 --> 24:33.639
Thousands.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.859
The last of you.

24:46.068 --> 24:49.655
Remember who you used to be, eh?

24:52.241 --> 24:55.536
I've never seen this man
in my life.

25:03.419 --> 25:06.047
Then-then why don't we

25:06.047 --> 25:07.590
destroy Wilhelm, <i>ja?</i>

25:07.590 --> 25:10.760
We could burn the file
right now.

25:10.760 --> 25:13.429
Like he never existed.

25:13.429 --> 25:14.513
Forever gone.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.350
<i>Ja, ja.</i> [chuckles] <i>Ja.</i>

25:22.021 --> 25:26.442
Once you sent that man, Fritz...

25:28.027 --> 25:30.071
It was done.

25:30.071 --> 25:32.323
I-I...

25:32.323 --> 25:35.534
- I'll give you
anything you want.
- No.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.371
- I don't want anything.
- I'm begging.

25:40.039 --> 25:42.375
I'm begging you.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.835
Like a dog.

25:44.835 --> 25:46.128
<i>Ja.</i>

25:47.755 --> 25:50.174
If I give you up, I...

25:50.174 --> 25:53.344
I give myself up.

25:56.013 --> 25:58.015
That's true.

26:01.018 --> 26:05.273
But I want your absence
from my life.

26:05.273 --> 26:07.275
Will you do that?

26:07.275 --> 26:09.360
<i>Ja.</i>

26:11.070 --> 26:12.989
Good.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.908
Good.

26:22.957 --> 26:24.917
She has a kid. I'm not gonna
act like that's nothing.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.878
I'm not gonna underplay that.
That is obviously something.

26:27.878 --> 26:29.839
A big something. A human being.

26:29.839 --> 26:31.966
Right? Right.
But here's the thing.

26:31.966 --> 26:33.509
I'm Lonny Flash.

26:33.509 --> 26:35.219
Kids fucking love me.

26:35.219 --> 26:38.431
Candy, cookies, Lonny Flash.
Like that.

26:38.431 --> 26:39.849
Lonny, are you fucking high?

26:39.849 --> 26:41.892
- Are you fucking high?
- Lonny,

26:41.892 --> 26:44.353
- keep it together.
- Oh, it is together.

26:44.353 --> 26:47.356
I am one solid piece
from toes to teeth, Houdini.

26:52.320 --> 26:55.906
Magic.

26:55.906 --> 26:57.992
So, how'd you
get into magic, anyway?

26:57.992 --> 27:00.786
It's kind of for nerds
in America.

27:00.786 --> 27:04.290
Cool kids are into football.
Cars. Acting.

27:06.709 --> 27:09.128
- My father
was a great magician.
- Mm.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.589
Famous throughout France.

27:11.589 --> 27:14.842
He used his show
to save hundreds of Jews

27:14.842 --> 27:16.719
during the war.

27:16.719 --> 27:20.181
What you might call
a righteous gentile.

27:20.181 --> 27:22.558
He'd bring Jews onstage
as part of his act

27:22.558 --> 27:25.102
and then, poof,
make them disappear.

27:25.102 --> 27:27.563
He hid them
in his prop warehouse

27:27.563 --> 27:30.941
and smuggled them out of France
in his truck.

27:30.941 --> 27:33.194
My mother, she was against this.

27:33.194 --> 27:35.321
Scared of what
might happen to him

27:35.321 --> 27:36.614
if he was caught.

27:36.614 --> 27:39.742
But he told her it was his duty.

27:40.826 --> 27:44.705
He said only magic
could fix this world.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.376
Wow.

27:49.794 --> 27:51.962
He sounds like an amazing guy.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.511
The Nazis hung him, of course.

28:00.513 --> 28:02.973
And they shot my mother.

28:11.941 --> 28:13.901
Trust that everyone's
doing their jobs,

28:13.901 --> 28:15.653
just as we're doing ours.

28:15.653 --> 28:16.904
<i>Maybe we should go see</i>

28:16.904 --> 28:18.322
- what's happening.
- No. Lonny,

28:18.322 --> 28:19.615
trust everyone
is doing their job,

28:19.615 --> 28:21.117
just as we're doing ours.

28:21.117 --> 28:22.910
Our role is clear.
We watch the briefcase.

28:22.910 --> 28:24.870
Roles are just suggestions, Georgie.

28:24.870 --> 28:26.455
I was once hired
on a Peckinpah picture

28:26.455 --> 28:27.665
to play a parsnip farmer.

28:27.665 --> 28:29.208
By the end of the picture,
I was playing

28:29.208 --> 28:31.043
the turnip farmer.
Much bigger role,

28:31.043 --> 28:32.878
let me tell you.

28:35.631 --> 28:38.592
- What the fuck?
- We need to move.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.683
Let the boys follow him.

28:45.683 --> 28:47.768
The Crow will stay put.

28:47.768 --> 28:49.437
We stay put.

28:52.148 --> 28:54.692
And when we find The Crow,
we find Hitler.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.923
The fuck did he go?

29:19.049 --> 29:20.468
Are you okay?

29:20.468 --> 29:22.136
- Yeah.
- Come on.

29:28.601 --> 29:30.352
What are you doing?

29:30.352 --> 29:32.938
We need to blend in.

29:32.938 --> 29:36.692
Yeah, you're not gonna blend in.

29:36.692 --> 29:38.360
Come on.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.119
Hey, I'm carrying a little
more water weight than normal.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.621
- Don't give a fuck, Lonny.
- Okay.

30:44.885 --> 30:45.803
Drop him.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.144
Lonny!

31:03.654 --> 31:06.615
Lonny, help!

31:16.417 --> 31:18.210
Lonny!

31:29.179 --> 31:30.848
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

31:32.683 --> 31:34.226
No. No, no.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.645
No.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.832
Holy shit.

31:56.832 --> 31:59.460
- We need to go, Lonny.
The police will be here soon.
- I'm sorry.

31:59.460 --> 32:03.088
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

32:09.178 --> 32:11.013
<i>[over radio] Top of the
hour, now. That's gonna be time</i>

32:11.013 --> 32:14.099
<i>for your weather report. Cold
front's gonna be dropping south</i>

32:14.099 --> 32:16.477
<i>through New England.
A lot of that snow's</i>

32:16.477 --> 32:19.396

32:21.482 --> 32:22.983
<i>Little bit left over</i>

32:22.983 --> 32:25.444
<i>from that front

32:30.574 --> 32:33.327
<i>- Dry weather, though...</i>
- Oh, crap.

32:53.013 --> 32:55.057
Let me see
your license.

32:55.057 --> 32:57.351
Yes, of course.

32:57.351 --> 33:00.562
I don't think
I was going too fast, was I?

33:00.562 --> 33:02.189
- You were.
- I was?

33:02.189 --> 33:03.899
And you were weaving.

33:03.899 --> 33:05.567
Weaving?

33:05.567 --> 33:07.653
Wow.

33:13.158 --> 33:15.202
Officer,

33:15.202 --> 33:16.954
how long will this take?

33:16.954 --> 33:19.039
What are you, in a rush?

33:19.039 --> 33:21.375
Yes, I am.

33:22.376 --> 33:25.212
Can I be honest with you?

33:25.212 --> 33:29.049
I was speeding
because I'm terrified.

33:29.049 --> 33:30.300
Terrified of what?

33:30.300 --> 33:31.677
My wife.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.303
- Funny man.
- No,

33:33.303 --> 33:34.430
no, that's not funny.

33:34.430 --> 33:35.931
You see, I have a girlfriend

33:35.931 --> 33:37.516
out on the sound,

33:37.516 --> 33:39.810
and my wife is back in the city.

33:39.810 --> 33:43.689
Now, if I'm not home
before she wakes up,

33:43.689 --> 33:46.108
you'll have a murder
to look into.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.778
You're sweating.

33:49.778 --> 33:52.740
I'm sweating?

33:52.740 --> 33:54.283
Well,

33:54.283 --> 33:56.785
it... it's a lot of work,
you know?

33:58.537 --> 33:59.830
Keeping up with two women.

33:59.830 --> 34:01.498
Lot of energy.

34:01.498 --> 34:03.417
Believe me.

34:06.545 --> 34:09.089
Okay, playboy.

34:09.089 --> 34:11.967
You pay this in 30 days
or you will go to jail.

34:11.967 --> 34:13.927
Good luck with the missus.

34:13.927 --> 34:16.597
I'm gonna need it. Thank you.

34:29.443 --> 34:31.361
Good morning, Annette.

34:31.361 --> 34:32.446
Morning, Mr. Offerman.

34:32.446 --> 34:34.573
Simon is waiting to see you.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.575
Ah.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.577
Good morning.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.455
Could you bring us some coffee
and cookies?

34:41.455 --> 34:42.956
- Oh, of course.
- Hmm?

34:44.541 --> 34:46.585
Ah! Simon.

34:46.585 --> 34:51.840
Shalom. Don't get up.
Don't get up.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.551
So, what are you
doing here, Simon?

34:54.551 --> 34:58.180
Well, uh, I was just wondering.

34:58.180 --> 35:00.766
Uh... A few days ago

35:00.766 --> 35:03.268
when you came to see me
in my office and asking me

35:03.268 --> 35:04.686
- about Viktor Frondheim?
- Yes.

35:04.686 --> 35:07.481
Well, coincidentally, the file

35:07.481 --> 35:09.066
I had on the man was stolen

35:09.066 --> 35:12.277
on the very same day
by some thug.

35:12.277 --> 35:15.155
- Ah.
- And then just yesterday,

35:15.155 --> 35:18.033
we heard, uh,
about a man by the name

35:18.033 --> 35:19.535
of Jerome Windholm

35:19.535 --> 35:22.746
who was found dead in his home
in rural Connecticut.

35:22.746 --> 35:24.957
- Murdered.
- Jerome Windholm.

35:24.957 --> 35:27.376
- I don't...
- This is the alias
that Frondheim used

35:27.376 --> 35:28.502
for the last 30 years.

35:28.502 --> 35:29.837
Which I thought
you might have seen

35:29.837 --> 35:33.048
from the, uh... from his file.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.176
Frondheim is dead?

35:37.886 --> 35:40.222
- Are you here
to celebrate?
- Well...

35:40.222 --> 35:42.432
Well, I thought you might know

35:42.432 --> 35:44.643
something about this.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.729
What, was it in the newspapers?

35:49.731 --> 35:51.149
No.

35:53.443 --> 35:55.612
Simon?

35:57.990 --> 35:59.908
What are you doing?

35:59.908 --> 36:03.620
You think I have something
to do with this crime?

36:03.620 --> 36:07.040
You think I, what,
went to Connecticut

36:07.040 --> 36:08.750
and murdered this man?

36:08.750 --> 36:10.586
How did I murder him,
with my arthritis?

36:10.586 --> 36:14.214
Meyer, you have the finances
to hire an entire army

36:14.214 --> 36:16.091
- to take this man out,
if you so wished.
- Oh, no.

36:16.091 --> 36:18.051
- So if not you alone, then...
- Don't, don't.

36:18.051 --> 36:19.553
- Please.
- ...who?

36:19.553 --> 36:22.431
So, if you not alone,
then who?

36:22.431 --> 36:26.476
We got some real <i>Scooby-Doo</i>
operation over here.

36:26.476 --> 36:29.354
You know, <i>Hashem</i> works
in mysterious ways.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.648
I am glad Viktor's dead.

36:31.648 --> 36:32.941
You are not?

36:32.941 --> 36:34.902
Not like this.

36:34.902 --> 36:37.279
He-he should have been
brought to justice.

36:37.279 --> 36:39.114
And had a public trial.

36:39.114 --> 36:41.783
So that the world
could see that no man

36:41.783 --> 36:43.619
could get away with such evil.

36:43.619 --> 36:45.454
No man. Never again.

36:48.582 --> 36:51.126
Meyer...

36:51.126 --> 36:53.086
I think I need
to investigate you.

36:59.259 --> 37:00.886
Investigate me?

37:02.888 --> 37:04.848
On what charge?

37:04.848 --> 37:06.725
What, coincidence?

37:06.725 --> 37:09.603
I told you I saw this man.

37:09.603 --> 37:11.897
I mean, if Frondheim
is bold enough

37:11.897 --> 37:14.399
to go out to the street
in daylight,

37:14.399 --> 37:16.652
perhaps another survivor
saw him.

37:16.652 --> 37:20.864
And maybe that survivor doesn't
have the patience you have.

37:20.864 --> 37:24.076
I mean, your belief
that the slow grind

37:24.076 --> 37:28.121
of the gears of justice
will somehow, somehow prevail.

37:28.121 --> 37:30.999
And what if
that survivor is you?

37:32.125 --> 37:34.503
So what?

37:34.503 --> 37:36.129
So what if it was?

37:36.129 --> 37:39.675
It's not me,
but so what if it was?

37:39.675 --> 37:41.760
You think you have
a license on justice?

37:41.760 --> 37:45.055
Do you think you have
a patent on revenge?

37:45.055 --> 37:46.556
Don't talk to me about justice.

37:46.556 --> 37:48.266
Justice should have no fathers.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.476
I've hunted men in the jungles.

37:49.476 --> 37:51.436
I've tracked them
down the rat lines.

37:51.436 --> 37:54.356
You think you can drop
these cherry bombs

37:54.356 --> 37:57.234
from your ivory tower
without impunity?

37:57.234 --> 38:00.278
When a people are considered
rats and roaches,

38:00.278 --> 38:04.533
we Jews, we don't have the
luxury to meddle in the sewers.

38:04.533 --> 38:06.451
Meyer.

38:06.451 --> 38:09.538
Meyer, you're a prince.

38:09.538 --> 38:12.958
You have... You've been
chosen to be a prince.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.711
What our people
need to see is that a man

38:15.711 --> 38:17.796
who was a prisoner in the camps

38:17.796 --> 38:22.134
could rise from this darkness
and become a king.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.262
What people
are you talking about?

38:25.262 --> 38:27.472
Me. I need to see it.

38:27.472 --> 38:29.558
I need to believe in it, in you.

38:32.102 --> 38:35.564
Do not let this be you,
my brother.

38:36.690 --> 38:39.568
I endured, just as you.

38:40.777 --> 38:43.363
You're not God's broker.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.866
He spoke to me, too.

38:45.866 --> 38:48.160
Just as he did to you.

38:51.163 --> 38:53.832
Who the fuck are you, Meyer?

38:56.877 --> 38:59.212
I'm a survivor.

38:59.212 --> 39:01.131
That's who I am.

39:09.765 --> 39:12.184
If a single hair points to you,

39:12.184 --> 39:13.977
I will have no choice.

39:15.979 --> 39:18.607
It's only a matter of time,
my friend.

39:51.181 --> 39:53.934
Hurry up. We have,
like, two fucking minutes.

40:04.236 --> 40:06.363
You okay?

40:06.363 --> 40:08.115
Yeah, I'm okay.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.160
Come on.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.080
Thank you, Ricardo.

40:18.542 --> 40:21.503
Hey, assholes! We were sleeping.

40:21.670 --> 40:23.505
What kind of hotel is this?

40:24.214 --> 40:25.757
Hey! Stop!

40:27.634 --> 40:29.761
Stop!

40:32.097 --> 40:34.683
Ah, hello.
I'm looking for the spa...

40:47.529 --> 40:49.698
From your friend.
<i>Buen provecho.</i>

40:49.698 --> 40:51.908
It's a sign
from Harriet.

40:51.908 --> 40:54.619
To let us know
they've handled his thugs.

40:54.619 --> 40:56.329
The Crow is unflanked.

40:56.329 --> 40:58.415
Look at me. Look at me.

40:58.415 --> 41:00.542
This is most important.

41:00.542 --> 41:04.421
We cannot let on that we know
The Crow is vulnerable.

41:04.421 --> 41:05.714
Eat.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.976
Ruth and I used to go
to war over

41:17.976 --> 41:20.061
your great-grandmother's
rugelach.

41:20.061 --> 41:22.147
Couldn't get enough.

41:26.526 --> 41:28.612
How could you not let her know?

41:29.738 --> 41:32.490
My <i>safta</i> left Europe
with her daughter.

41:32.490 --> 41:35.452
Came to Brooklyn all alone.

41:37.454 --> 41:38.663
She was a single mom.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.290
- Jonah...
- She had nothing. No.

41:41.791 --> 41:43.960
She worked hard.

41:43.960 --> 41:46.630
Scrubbing floors
at the Howard Johnson's,

41:46.630 --> 41:51.009
doing everything that she could
to keep us on our feet.

41:51.009 --> 41:54.512
Keep me safe, keep me well,
to keep me loved.

41:57.432 --> 42:00.227
Love me like
she loved her sister.

42:02.479 --> 42:04.981
She never stopped loving you.

42:08.735 --> 42:10.737
She needed you.

42:12.405 --> 42:13.531
How could you...

42:15.533 --> 42:18.453
...possibly think that letting
her believe that you were dead

42:18.453 --> 42:20.121
was the best thing?

42:21.456 --> 42:23.792
She may have mourned me.

42:23.792 --> 42:25.502
She may have missed me.

42:27.504 --> 42:30.423
But she didn't need me, Jonah.

42:30.423 --> 42:34.261
Because she had you.

42:34.261 --> 42:36.346
You were her blessing.

42:38.473 --> 42:40.475
I see that now.

42:43.979 --> 42:46.231
I need to go to the bathroom.

43:09.296 --> 43:10.672
This is the women's restroom.

43:11.006 --> 43:12.424
Where is he?

43:15.677 --> 43:17.429
You know I won't tell you.

43:19.097 --> 43:20.849
You already did.

43:49.085 --> 43:50.670
She dead?

43:52.589 --> 43:54.883
Yeah.

43:54.883 --> 43:57.302
All of dinner,
she held her purse tight.

43:57.302 --> 43:59.596
Wasn't because of pickpockets.

43:59.596 --> 44:03.099
A train ticket to Caieiras
for tomorrow morning.

44:05.226 --> 44:07.896
I'll bet Hitler is in Caieiras.

44:07.896 --> 44:09.522
Good.

44:10.523 --> 44:12.108
Thanks for dinner.

44:12.108 --> 44:15.904
You're going to have to stop
killing Nazis without me.

44:15.904 --> 44:17.614
If you knew it was her
the whole time,

44:17.614 --> 44:19.866
how come you didn't correct me
when I first ruled her out?

44:19.866 --> 44:23.161
If you knew it was her,
why did you rule her out at all?

44:24.204 --> 44:26.790
Perhaps you were testing me,

44:26.790 --> 44:29.334
just as I was testing you.

44:49.020 --> 44:51.147
No!

44:51.147 --> 44:52.565
Millie, let's go.

44:52.565 --> 44:55.026
I lost my...

46:31.706 --> 46:33.708
Late night?

46:37.170 --> 46:40.840
How's my two-faced,
two-timing wanker of a fiancé?

46:52.435 --> 46:53.561
What is it?

47:16.668 --> 47:18.836
The Crow has been killed.

47:20.213 --> 47:22.298
Last night.

47:22.298 --> 47:23.841
In Bariloche.

47:25.260 --> 47:30.098
It appears to have been them.

47:31.766 --> 47:33.309
Are you ready, Joe?

47:40.066 --> 47:46.364
This is what we've been preparing for.

47:46.990 --> 47:48.241
Find them.

47:50.034 --> 47:52.412
Find them.

47:52.412 --> 47:58.042
And bring me their scalps.

48:00.003 --> 48:02.422
The Hunters.

48:08.469 --> 48:13.182
<i>Geronimo, Geronimo ♪</i>

48:14.726 --> 48:19.272
<i>Geronimo, Geronimo ♪</i>

48:20.356 --> 48:24.861
<i>Geronimo, Geronimo ♪</i>
