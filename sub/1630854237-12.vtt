No, no!

00:44.078 --> 00:45.424
Where is he?

00:45.424 --> 00:47.219
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:47.219 --> 00:48.393
God, Vic!

00:48.393 --> 00:49.394
What are you doing?

00:49.394 --> 00:50.809
Put the bat down!

00:50.809 --> 00:51.913
It was just a dream!

00:51.913 --> 00:53.432
Oh, my God, was it the lions?

00:53.432 --> 00:55.262
They came for you?
- What? No!

00:55.262 --> 00:57.609
- Did they...
- It was worse, it was...

00:57.609 --> 00:59.507
a dream where I actually
won the election,

00:59.507 --> 01:01.509
became mayor, and then
all my teeth fell out.

01:02.579 --> 01:04.995
You know what?

01:04.995 --> 01:07.067
If I were Freud,
I would say that means

01:07.067 --> 01:09.448
you have unfulfilled
sexual needs.

01:09.448 --> 01:11.278
I don't... talk to Freud.
I didn't make the rules.

01:11.278 --> 01:13.107
No, it's just...
all it was was just a...

01:13.107 --> 01:15.005
Yeah, I know. It was probably
about the election, huh?

01:15.005 --> 01:16.455
- Yes.
- You know what?

01:16.455 --> 01:17.732
My psych professor
said Freud was actually wrong

01:17.732 --> 01:19.527
about like a lot of stuff.

01:19.527 --> 01:21.288
It was just the stress
of the race, really.

01:21.288 --> 01:22.599
Yeah, I mean,
that makes sense.

01:22.599 --> 01:24.360
You're ahead in the polls,
and that's unexpected.

01:24.360 --> 01:25.706
On the bright side though,

01:25.706 --> 01:27.294
you may not have a job
after tomorrow.

01:27.294 --> 01:29.123
Was that supposed to
make me feel better?

01:29.123 --> 01:31.367
No, look, I just... when you
break the chain of command,

01:31.367 --> 01:32.920
that's what happens...
people get fired.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.543
But, no, I was saying

01:35.543 --> 01:36.924
being discharged in disgrace

01:36.924 --> 01:38.305
will put a damper
on your campaign,

01:38.305 --> 01:39.858
and then you won't
have to be mayor.

01:41.480 --> 01:42.309
Oh, but then I'm
going to have to quit

01:42.309 --> 01:43.655
with you in solidarity, huh?

01:43.655 --> 01:45.312
But then, we can make our
little corn husk dolls

01:45.312 --> 01:47.452
and sell them out of a van.

01:47.452 --> 01:49.523
- Get out of my room.
- Okay.

01:49.523 --> 01:51.041
Take the bat.

01:51.041 --> 01:52.560
- You sure?
- Yep.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.114
I was ready though.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.460
I'ma take this too.

01:55.460 --> 01:56.806
Fine.

02:04.917 --> 02:05.884
Okay.

02:07.541 --> 02:09.715
Oh, shoot.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.616
Hi.
- Hi.

02:13.616 --> 02:14.962
You're not ready.

02:14.962 --> 02:17.516
I-I lost track of time.

02:17.516 --> 02:19.035
Yeah, I can see that. Um...

02:19.035 --> 02:20.416
I can take a hint and
go and get dinner alone if...

02:20.416 --> 02:21.865
No. No, no, no, no.
Come in.

02:21.865 --> 02:24.523
I just... it's been
a crazy 24 hours.

02:24.523 --> 02:26.353
Oh, you've gone a bit mad.

02:26.353 --> 02:27.837
That's fun.

02:27.837 --> 02:29.321
Yeah, there was
this incident at work.

02:29.321 --> 02:32.255
My team collectively
took over a call

02:32.255 --> 02:34.326
and basically
disobeyed our captain.

02:34.326 --> 02:36.570
And I-I took
charge of the team.

02:36.570 --> 02:38.537
A mutiny?

02:38.537 --> 02:40.194
Okay, you're talking
to the right person.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.368
Let's get into it.

02:41.368 --> 02:43.093
"Mutiny on the Bounty,"
classic.

02:43.093 --> 02:46.373
"Spithead and the Nore,"
1797, dicey.

02:46.373 --> 02:47.615
"Revolt of the Last"...
- You're like a big-time nerd.

02:47.615 --> 02:49.307
We prefer the term
history buff.

02:49.307 --> 02:51.205
It gives us fewer flashbacks
of being stuffed into lockers.

02:51.205 --> 02:54.001
So of the mutinies
you listed,

02:54.001 --> 02:55.968
were there any good outcomes?

02:55.968 --> 02:57.901
Um, no, no,
but that's only because

02:57.901 --> 02:59.731
they were labeled mutinies, right?

02:59.731 --> 03:01.111
There were plenty of
mutinies with good outcomes.

03:01.111 --> 03:02.665
We just call them revolutions.

03:02.665 --> 03:04.563
So it's semantics.

03:04.563 --> 03:06.082
Precisely, yeah.

03:06.082 --> 03:07.048
Hey, give me a play by
play of the incident.

03:07.048 --> 03:08.636
No. No, no, no.

03:08.636 --> 03:11.536
Um, sorry, we-we were
supposed to go out to dinner.

03:11.536 --> 03:12.744
You're probably hungry.
I'll just go and get--

03:12.744 --> 03:14.470
Look, I-I might be a nerd,
but I can definitely

03:14.470 --> 03:16.230
read a room,
and I'm getting the sense

03:16.230 --> 03:18.405
that you're not exactly
in a dating place.

03:18.405 --> 03:21.235
It's just
it's not a good time.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.409
- Mm-hmm.
- Sorry.

03:22.409 --> 03:24.031
No, it's fine.
Don't apologize.

03:24.031 --> 03:25.722
Screw the day.

03:25.722 --> 03:27.862
I'm going to make you an
omelet, yeah?

03:27.862 --> 03:29.899
With, um, one pickle.

03:29.899 --> 03:31.866
- And a jar of mayonnaise.
- Cool.

03:31.866 --> 03:33.420
Should we get takeout?

03:33.420 --> 03:35.215
And you can tell me
all about this mutiny.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.975
A revolution, not a mutiny.

03:36.975 --> 03:39.011
Semantics, right?

03:42.981 --> 03:44.741
I'm sweating.

03:44.741 --> 03:46.605
Any theories
on what might happen?

03:46.605 --> 03:48.987
We could all be fired.

03:48.987 --> 03:50.920
They can fire all of us?

03:50.920 --> 03:52.611
Uh, no, not all of us.

03:52.611 --> 03:54.855
I wasn't a part of this.
- Well, Beckett voluntarily

03:54.855 --> 03:56.443
went to the Center
for Excellence,

03:56.443 --> 03:59.618
so they have to see that there
was reason for our pushback.

03:59.618 --> 04:01.068
I mean, it's a genius
move on his part,

04:01.068 --> 04:02.828
right, admitting himself?
- Yep.

04:02.828 --> 04:04.278
What do you mean?

04:04.278 --> 04:06.418
They can't fire somebody
for seeking help.

04:06.418 --> 04:07.937
- Oh, that's sneaky.
- Wow.

04:07.937 --> 04:09.697
Well, whatever happens,
we did the right thing,

04:09.697 --> 04:11.112
all right?
I stand by that.

04:11.112 --> 04:13.287
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.013
Well, you know
I would have done the same.

04:15.013 --> 04:16.256
Solidarity.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.878
Screw it.

04:17.878 --> 04:20.536
This city isn't protecting
the citizens or us.

04:20.536 --> 04:22.538
Let them fire us.
I'm done.

04:23.884 --> 04:26.058
Is he okay?

04:27.232 --> 04:28.820
Oh, I'm-I'm not sure.

04:28.820 --> 04:30.200
He stayed at his
place last night.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.306
A-Shift, line up!

04:36.966 --> 04:38.485
Despite my efforts to handle

04:38.485 --> 04:41.660
a very complicated
and bureaucratic situation,

04:41.660 --> 04:44.318
you, Station 19,

04:44.318 --> 04:46.838
took matters
into your own hands.

04:46.838 --> 04:48.840
When you break
the chain of command

04:48.840 --> 04:53.085
in a paramilitary structure,
we call that a mutiny.

04:54.190 --> 04:57.573
A mutiny spits in the face of
that paramilitary tradition.

04:57.573 --> 04:59.747
A mutiny calls for an
administrative investigation.

04:59.747 --> 05:02.163
And a mutiny results in
the termination

05:02.163 --> 05:03.717
of each and every party involved.

05:03.717 --> 05:04.994
A mutiny--

05:04.994 --> 05:07.065
It wasn't a mutiny, Chief.

05:10.413 --> 05:12.277
Respectfully, Chief Ross,

05:12.277 --> 05:15.349
page 46, section 38,
subsection D of the POG

05:15.349 --> 05:17.420
states
that when a captain in command

05:17.420 --> 05:19.353
is incapacitated,
the duty to lead the team

05:19.353 --> 05:20.423
falls on the senior man.

05:20.423 --> 05:21.735
I am the senior man.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.014
Beckett may have been
able-bodied and conscious,

05:25.014 --> 05:26.533
but he was not of sound mind.

05:26.533 --> 05:28.362
Anyone here can attest to that.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.709
What happened was not
an overthrowing of power

05:30.709 --> 05:31.848
for the sake of power.

05:31.848 --> 05:33.781
It was an action
and safety protocol

05:33.781 --> 05:35.369
straight from the book.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.440
It was a life-saving
decision, Chief.

05:38.717 --> 05:41.548
<i>Ladder 19, Aid Car 19,
and Engine 19,</i>

05:41.548 --> 05:44.205
<i>rescue requested
at 47 degrees,</i>

05:44.205 --> 05:46.035
<i>36 minutes north and 120...</i>

05:46.035 --> 05:48.348
- Who's our captain?
<i>- 27 minutes west.</i>

05:48.348 --> 05:50.108
It's me.

05:50.108 --> 05:52.559
Let's go, 19!
Move, move!

06:03.259 --> 06:05.123
Get coordinates instead of an
address, that's weird, right?

06:05.123 --> 06:06.711
I mean, it is pretty strange.

06:06.711 --> 06:08.471
Do you think we should
maybe ask where exactly?

06:08.471 --> 06:10.404
No. I'm trying to
stay off her radar.

06:10.404 --> 06:11.716
You ask.
- I'm trying to keep my job.

06:11.716 --> 06:13.062
Uh, Montgomery?

06:17.307 --> 06:19.344
Chief, where do
these coordinates land?

06:19.344 --> 06:21.657
I'm getting information
from dispatch sparingly,

06:21.657 --> 06:23.659
but it's looking like we're
heading toward the Cascades.

06:23.659 --> 06:25.143
Was it a hiking incident?

06:25.143 --> 06:26.593
I used to go there
all the time.

06:26.593 --> 06:29.043
A TizTam star was
filming a video and fell.

06:29.043 --> 06:30.493
TizTam?

06:30.493 --> 06:31.839
It's a social media platform.

06:31.839 --> 06:32.806
I hate that I know that.

06:32.806 --> 06:35.187
Wow, I am old.

06:35.187 --> 06:37.500
One of the fans called in
after seeing the live feed.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.226
The video's from a Stella Trix.

06:39.226 --> 06:41.193
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I know her videos.

06:42.505 --> 06:45.612
She raised $300k for a
food insecurity charity.

06:45.612 --> 06:46.854
Shut up.

06:46.854 --> 06:48.856
Here's the video.

06:48.856 --> 06:51.445
<i>It's so off the grid.
It's just...</i>

06:51.445 --> 06:53.309
<i>It's real, you know?</i>

06:53.309 --> 06:56.001
<i>When I'm in a serene
environment like this,</i>

06:56.001 --> 06:57.002
<i>it just...</i>

06:57.002 --> 06:58.141
<i>Stella!</i>
both: Ooh.

06:58.141 --> 06:59.108
Looks like the
cameraman fell too.

06:59.108 --> 07:00.972
That's a long drop.

07:00.972 --> 07:03.181
And when we land,
grab your rescue gear.

07:03.181 --> 07:04.976
We may need to rappel down.

07:04.976 --> 07:07.116
I'll be tracking the search
patterns on the map with you.

07:07.116 --> 07:09.808
Did you see the district for
our inspection route today?

07:09.808 --> 07:12.362
It's just a bunch of
mansions and yoga studios.

07:12.362 --> 07:14.295
Last time I worked
that area, this lady

07:14.295 --> 07:16.815
threatened to sue me because
I got mud on her carpet.

07:16.815 --> 07:17.989
They're such snobs.

07:17.989 --> 07:19.887
Well, we should get going.

07:27.757 --> 07:28.724
Hey, Theo?

07:30.588 --> 07:32.728
Theo, stop, stop, stop.

07:34.212 --> 07:36.835
What is going on with you?

07:36.835 --> 07:38.319
The arson
investigation I requested

07:38.319 --> 07:39.562
at that house
and the barbershop

07:39.562 --> 07:41.840
in my old neighborhood?

07:41.840 --> 07:43.808
It was dismissed.
- What?

07:43.808 --> 07:45.810
So fast?
Did they even investigate?

07:45.810 --> 07:47.570
Nope.

07:47.570 --> 07:49.745
They just made a decision
off the case reports.

07:49.745 --> 07:51.194
They can do that?

07:51.194 --> 07:53.334
Guess that hood's
easy to overlook.

07:53.334 --> 07:54.991
Let's go.

07:59.582 --> 08:01.101
<i>Let's get that winch set up.</i>

08:08.246 --> 08:09.523
When was the
last time a chief

08:09.523 --> 08:11.111
played captain of a station?

08:11.111 --> 08:12.526
Maybe the last time
there was a mutiny?

08:12.526 --> 08:14.355
So she's testing us?

08:14.355 --> 08:16.012
Better not mess up then.

08:20.051 --> 08:21.673
Yeah, that's a cell
range signal booster.

08:21.673 --> 08:23.019
It must be theirs.

08:23.019 --> 08:24.365
Well, we're in
the right spot then.

08:24.365 --> 08:26.057
Right.
All right, spread out.

08:26.057 --> 08:27.437
Groups of two.
Let's go.

08:28.956 --> 08:33.374
Hey, so there aren't any
snakes in these caves, right?

08:35.549 --> 08:36.481
Right?

08:37.447 --> 08:39.346
Hey.

08:39.346 --> 08:41.969
Sullivan, will you
wait up a second?

08:48.389 --> 08:49.908
They'd follow up
on your report

08:49.908 --> 08:51.185
if the call was in
this neighborhood.

08:51.185 --> 08:51.979
Maybe.

08:54.913 --> 08:56.570
Theo, we inspected
that barber shop

08:56.570 --> 08:58.054
from top to bottom,
and we fixed the problem.

08:58.054 --> 08:59.400
I know.
I was there.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.817
And the fire
two blocks over--

09:01.817 --> 09:03.888
that's a lot of electrical
fires for one area.

09:03.888 --> 09:05.406
Did they think
that was coincidence?

09:05.406 --> 09:06.925
They said the buildings
in the area are old

09:06.925 --> 09:08.099
and it's common
to be out of code.

09:08.099 --> 09:09.928
- Well, they weren't.
- I know.

09:09.928 --> 09:11.585
And so it had no reason
to go up like that.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.553
Vic, can we drop it?

09:13.553 --> 09:15.106
Drop it?

09:15.106 --> 09:16.072
There's nothing
else to do, okay?

09:16.072 --> 09:17.798
It's... it's done.

09:19.835 --> 09:21.561
You know what?
Change of plan.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.114
Vic, what the
hell are you doing?

09:23.114 --> 09:25.254
This isn't right,
and these rich folks can wait.

09:26.876 --> 09:28.188
We're going to do our
own investigation.

09:32.019 --> 09:35.091
Hello!
Seattle Fire Department!

09:35.091 --> 09:36.576
Hello?

09:37.784 --> 09:39.268
Seattle Fire!

09:39.268 --> 09:41.926
Call out!

09:41.926 --> 09:42.961
Anyone?

09:42.961 --> 09:44.963
Can anybody hear me?

09:44.963 --> 09:46.758
Respond if you can hear us!

09:46.758 --> 09:48.104
If anybody's there,
call out!

09:48.104 --> 09:49.278
Call out!

09:49.278 --> 09:50.969
Seattle FD!

09:50.969 --> 09:53.972
If you can hear me, call out!

09:53.972 --> 09:55.284
Great, another cave.

09:55.284 --> 09:57.597
Hello?
Anyone?

09:58.805 --> 10:00.772
Seattle Fire!

10:00.772 --> 10:04.465
Dear diary,
today really sucked.

10:04.465 --> 10:07.158
Seattle FD!
Call out!

10:07.158 --> 10:09.298
Respond if you can hear us!

10:09.298 --> 10:12.301
<i>Officer backup requested at
Gray Sloan Memorial protest.</i>

10:14.303 --> 10:16.374
Call out if you can hear us!

10:16.374 --> 10:17.617
Hello?

10:18.894 --> 10:20.550
There's nothing over here.

10:20.550 --> 10:22.138
We're never going
to find them this way.

10:22.138 --> 10:23.484
We're not getting
any responses.

10:23.484 --> 10:24.658
They're most
likely unconscious.

10:24.658 --> 10:27.316
Yeah, or dead.
Looks like a long drop.

10:27.316 --> 10:28.904
- Sully.
- Sorry, I forgot your rule.

10:28.904 --> 10:30.250
Don't say dead.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.320
Unless there's a reason...

10:31.320 --> 10:33.080
To say dead. yeah.

10:46.507 --> 10:47.750
Hello, help.

10:47.750 --> 10:49.165
- Hey, there.
- Help.

10:49.165 --> 10:51.167
What can I do for you?
Oh, okay, okay.

10:51.167 --> 10:52.513
Please, help me.

10:52.513 --> 10:54.584
I'm having a--I don't know.

10:54.584 --> 10:55.862
Muscle cramps.

10:55.862 --> 10:57.346
Oh!
- Okay, just have a seat

10:57.346 --> 10:58.519
right here.
- Oh!

10:58.519 --> 11:00.038
Okay, sit on down.

11:00.038 --> 11:01.764
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

11:01.764 --> 11:03.041
I can help.

11:03.041 --> 11:05.526
Okay.

11:05.526 --> 11:07.701
Respond if you can hear us!

11:07.701 --> 11:11.222
Hey, Sully, do you
remember the mission,

11:11.222 --> 11:13.362
our second tour,
where we located that guy

11:13.362 --> 11:15.364
using his phone signal?
- Right!

11:15.364 --> 11:16.710
Okay.
- The video.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.125
Yeah, is it, um...

11:18.125 --> 11:19.230
Yes, it's still
recording live.

11:19.230 --> 11:21.059
Great.
- So we should, um...

11:21.059 --> 11:22.854
Yeah.
Everyone, turn off your lights.

11:22.854 --> 11:24.235
Lights off, everybody.

11:24.235 --> 11:27.134
<i>I repeat.
19, turn off your lights.</i>

11:27.134 --> 11:28.964
- What?
- All of them?

11:28.964 --> 11:30.586
Herrera,
listen to your captain.

11:30.586 --> 11:32.726
<i>That is an order.
Turn them off, all of them,</i>

11:32.726 --> 11:33.900
<i>torches, floodlights,
all of it.</i>

11:33.900 --> 11:35.211
We have a plan.

11:44.669 --> 11:46.740
There aren't any bats
in these caves, right?

11:49.053 --> 11:50.882
Will someone please answer me?

11:54.679 --> 11:56.094
Okay, we need
one torch per team.

11:56.094 --> 11:57.751
Shine it on the ceiling,

11:57.751 --> 12:00.823
<i>and I'll be watching on
the live feed for any light.</i>

12:02.514 --> 12:03.550
Sully?

12:03.550 --> 12:04.896
- West side.
- West side. Yeah.

12:08.106 --> 12:11.006
Okay, 19, start walking forward
until I tell you to stop.

12:13.422 --> 12:15.113
<i>Watch your step.</i>

12:15.113 --> 12:17.081
<i>We don't need another
rescue on our hands.</i>

12:26.918 --> 12:28.782
<i>Stop.</i>

12:28.782 --> 12:30.128
<i>All right.</i>

12:30.128 --> 12:32.268
Everybody,
backtrack three steps.

12:32.268 --> 12:34.684
Back three.

12:37.308 --> 12:38.723
Freeze, right there.
Right there!

12:40.345 --> 12:42.106
Herrera, drop your light.

12:43.728 --> 12:45.592
Come on.
Where are you?

12:45.592 --> 12:47.628
<i>Bishop, drop your light.</i>

12:47.628 --> 12:49.216
Sully, drop your light.

12:50.459 --> 12:53.289
Montgomery, click your light.

12:57.155 --> 12:58.950
Got 'em.
Montgomery, that's it.

12:58.950 --> 13:00.331
That's where they fell.

13:00.331 --> 13:02.989
<i>We're coming to you.</i>
- Go.

13:07.338 --> 13:09.305
Man, it's not even recognizable.

13:09.305 --> 13:12.067
Okay, the most common signs
of arson are unusual

13:12.067 --> 13:14.138
burn patterns
and no accidental causes.

13:14.138 --> 13:15.967
Oh, Vic, this is
a waste of time.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.177
Okay.

13:19.177 --> 13:20.903
This... this is not you.

13:20.903 --> 13:22.560
The Theo I know would
be busting down doors

13:22.560 --> 13:23.630
to get to the bottom of this.

13:23.630 --> 13:24.631
What is going on with you?

13:24.631 --> 13:26.150
I don't know.

13:33.260 --> 13:34.158
Hey.

13:36.367 --> 13:39.025
You know when my family's
restaurant burned?

13:39.025 --> 13:41.613
I don't know, it was...

13:41.613 --> 13:44.375
it was really hard to
see it like that, all those...

13:44.375 --> 13:48.379
those gatherings and those
memories, my whole childhood.

13:48.379 --> 13:50.381
That fire was like the death
of a family member.

13:50.381 --> 13:53.004
Yeah, but then
you guys rebuilt it.

13:53.004 --> 13:54.557
And everything
went back to normal.

13:54.557 --> 13:56.836
Yeah, I guess. I was just
trying to say I get it.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.010
No, but you don't get it.

13:59.010 --> 14:01.047
Your family got to
keep their restaurant.

14:01.047 --> 14:03.704
Tomás won't be able
to keep this place.

14:03.704 --> 14:05.189
He'll be pushed out.

14:05.189 --> 14:07.018
This place will become
some trendy coffee shop

14:07.018 --> 14:09.400
or a spa or something.

14:09.400 --> 14:12.506
You used to come here
with your dad, huh?

14:12.506 --> 14:13.542
Every Sunday.

14:15.475 --> 14:17.373
So this is probably
one of the last places

14:17.373 --> 14:18.719
you have memories of him in.

14:23.552 --> 14:25.968
Yeah.

14:29.316 --> 14:31.146
And now, it's gone.

14:31.146 --> 14:32.216
It's like he's being...

14:32.216 --> 14:33.838
Erased?

14:36.151 --> 14:37.221
Yeah.

14:42.329 --> 14:45.436
Can you also look up
photos of common devices?

14:45.436 --> 14:48.335
At the academy,
we did a seminar on that.

14:48.335 --> 14:50.682
I think that will
give us something.

14:52.650 --> 14:54.272
Yep.

14:54.272 --> 14:57.448
Anchors are set.
Ropes are set.

14:57.448 --> 14:59.174
All right, Herrera,
Gibson, on belay.

14:59.174 --> 15:01.452
Bishop, Montgomery, on rappel.

15:01.452 --> 15:03.109
Let's go. On belay.
Bring 'em back.

15:03.109 --> 15:05.180
<i>Okay,
what is your name, sir?</i>

15:05.180 --> 15:08.252
Reggie, Reggie Paulson.

15:08.252 --> 15:10.185
My muscles
are cramping all over.

15:10.185 --> 15:12.290
It hurts.
- When did this start?

15:12.290 --> 15:13.636
I don't know.

15:13.636 --> 15:15.915
I was cleaning my garage, and...

15:15.915 --> 15:18.193
Okay.
Okay, well, just stay calm.

15:18.193 --> 15:20.643
I need you to sit still
so that I can...

15:20.643 --> 15:22.507
I may have been
wrong to come here.

15:22.507 --> 15:24.302
I think I need a doctor.

15:24.302 --> 15:26.132
Well, I am a doctor.

15:26.132 --> 15:28.134
You are in good hands.

15:28.134 --> 15:29.859
Now, I just need to
check your vitals,

15:29.859 --> 15:32.552
and we'll see what
we're dealing with here.

15:33.656 --> 15:35.762
Wow, your blood
pressure is high.

15:35.762 --> 15:37.626
Did you take anything
today, Reggie?

15:37.626 --> 15:39.421
Any... any drugs?

15:39.421 --> 15:41.871
No, I...no.

15:41.871 --> 15:44.150
I hear a wheezing.

15:44.150 --> 15:46.117
Do you have
a history of asthma?

15:46.117 --> 15:47.567
No.

15:47.567 --> 15:49.949
Listen, I'm going to
prep a nebulizer for you.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.744
It'll-it'll help.
- Okay.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.643
Tell me where do you
feel the pain the most?

15:54.643 --> 15:57.473
All...
over.

15:57.473 --> 15:59.406
I can't...

15:59.406 --> 16:00.821
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

16:00.821 --> 16:02.478
Don't worry, don't worry.

16:02.478 --> 16:05.033
Reggie, we're going
to figure this out.

16:05.033 --> 16:08.174
Besides, Grey Sloan Memorial
is right down the street.

16:08.174 --> 16:10.176
No, I...

16:10.176 --> 16:11.971
I couldn't get to Grey Sloan.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.733
A car, it crashed into it.

16:15.733 --> 16:18.149
What?
What did you say?

16:18.149 --> 16:20.082
A car...

16:20.082 --> 16:21.670
...ran through a crowd.

16:21.670 --> 16:23.672
I couldn't get
anywhere near it.

16:23.672 --> 16:25.329
Put this on.
Breathe deep.

16:33.199 --> 16:34.683
- Ready, Bishop.
- Yeah.

16:38.549 --> 16:40.792
<i>Several doctors
were hit by a car</i>

16:40.792 --> 16:42.691
<i>outside the reproductive
rights clinic</i>

16:42.691 --> 16:44.624
<i>at Gray Sloan
Memorial Hospital.</i>

16:44.624 --> 16:46.453
<i>Requesting any available
aid cars to the scene.</i>

16:46.453 --> 16:48.835
- Oh, God.
- What did they say?

16:48.835 --> 16:50.181
Whoa!

16:50.181 --> 16:52.045
Whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.529
Bishop, both hands
on your rope.

16:53.529 --> 16:55.117
What did they say?
What did they say!

16:55.117 --> 16:56.394
Hey, take a breath, okay?

16:56.394 --> 16:57.602
You know as much
as I do right now.

16:57.602 --> 16:59.397
Stay focused.

16:59.397 --> 17:01.054
Just, um,
Carina's at work today.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.883
If you could just find
out what's happening--

17:04.540 --> 17:05.714
Whoa, Maya.

17:05.714 --> 17:07.060
I got you.
I got you.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.544
Herrera, I got you.

17:08.544 --> 17:10.305
Bishop, listen to me,
all right?

17:10.305 --> 17:11.892
I will find out
as much as I can.

17:11.892 --> 17:13.894
But right now, you
have to focus, okay?

17:13.894 --> 17:15.379
Right now,
you are part of a team.

17:15.379 --> 17:16.380
Do you hear me?

17:16.380 --> 17:18.899
Maya, breathe.

17:18.899 --> 17:20.487
She's at work today, okay?

17:20.487 --> 17:22.731
So what if... what
if... what if she got...

17:22.731 --> 17:24.767
what if she got... what
if she got hit by a car,

17:24.767 --> 17:25.975
and I'm stuck here,
and I can't get to her.

17:25.975 --> 17:26.976
Oh, my God.
- Maya!

17:26.976 --> 17:28.323
Oh, my God!

17:28.323 --> 17:31.395
Oh, my God.

17:31.395 --> 17:32.913
See, my wife works at
Grey Sloan Memorial,

17:32.913 --> 17:35.330
and she hasn't been replying
to my texts all day.

17:35.330 --> 17:38.919
Oh, okay, okay.

17:41.336 --> 17:43.269
Here you go.
Here you go.

17:44.994 --> 17:47.066
Just take slow, deep breaths.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.722
I'll see if I can
get you something

17:48.722 --> 17:50.034
for the pain and nausea.

17:52.899 --> 17:54.935
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine, it's fine.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.835
I'm-I'm sorry.

17:57.835 --> 17:59.699
Okay.

17:59.699 --> 18:01.356
No, no, no, no.
You just need to stay...

18:01.356 --> 18:04.117
- Ow!
- Okay, hang on.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.188
Hang on.
Let me examine your abdomen.

18:09.018 --> 18:10.951
Yeah, that doesn't
make any sense.

18:10.951 --> 18:14.196
See, your abdomen
is very tender and rigid,

18:14.196 --> 18:16.129
which usually would
indicate you need surgery.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.545
But you don't have a fever.

18:18.545 --> 18:20.444
And you've been moving around.

18:20.444 --> 18:22.653
All that pain and movement
makes me think kidney stones.

18:22.653 --> 18:24.275
But, no, the rigid abdomen.

18:24.275 --> 18:25.966
No, don't worry about it.
Don't worry.

18:25.966 --> 18:27.658
We're going to get
you to a hospital.

18:27.658 --> 18:29.487
<i>Thank you for calling Grey
Sloan Memorial Hospital.</i>

18:29.487 --> 18:30.385
<i>If this is an emergency...</i>
- Oh, crap.

18:30.385 --> 18:31.489
Okay, you know what?

18:31.489 --> 18:32.559
I'm going to call Seattle Pres.

18:32.559 --> 18:34.837
Don't worry.

18:34.837 --> 18:36.494
Maya,
Carina's going to be okay.

18:36.494 --> 18:37.840
You don't know that.

18:37.840 --> 18:38.979
Hey, listen to me,
Maya, you just

18:38.979 --> 18:41.016
got cleared off desk duty.

18:41.016 --> 18:42.638
We might have a mutiny
stamped to all of our files,

18:42.638 --> 18:43.950
and the chief is deciding
whether we have jobs tomorrow.

18:43.950 --> 18:44.951
Pull it together.

18:44.951 --> 18:46.401
Lieutenant Bishop!

18:49.576 --> 18:50.784
Yes?

18:50.784 --> 18:52.579
Listen to me.

18:52.579 --> 18:54.409
Right now, you are a first
responder, all right?

18:54.409 --> 18:56.169
You are not a wife.
You are not a daughter.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.584
You are not an Olympian.

18:57.584 --> 18:59.483
We are here to save lives.

18:59.483 --> 19:02.071
There is nothing you can do
over there in this moment.

19:02.071 --> 19:03.314
Do you copy?

19:07.111 --> 19:08.940
Okay, okay.

19:11.011 --> 19:13.013
Let's keep going.
Just keep going.

19:17.086 --> 19:18.087
Easy does it.
Come on.

19:21.125 --> 19:22.609
Yes, we are waiting
for an aid car,

19:22.609 --> 19:24.266
but they're backed up,

19:24.266 --> 19:26.026
and he's showing signs
of a surgical abdomen.

19:26.026 --> 19:27.683
<i>Does the patient have any
other past medical history</i>

19:27.683 --> 19:28.926
<i>or surgery?</i>
- No, no.

19:28.926 --> 19:30.721
But I think that he--

19:30.721 --> 19:33.379
<i>Did you get the
patient's temperature?</i>

19:33.379 --> 19:34.725
It's getting worse.

19:34.725 --> 19:37.245
Okay, hang on, please.
Hang on.

19:37.245 --> 19:39.557
Okay, let me see your arm.
This... this wasn't here before.

19:39.557 --> 19:41.387
How long has this been there?
- I don't know.

19:41.387 --> 19:43.389
I didn't notice.
- Okay, you said you were

19:43.389 --> 19:44.700
cleaning out your garage
today, right?

19:44.700 --> 19:46.392
Yes.

19:46.392 --> 19:48.359
Well, spiders like
to nest in dark spaces,

19:48.359 --> 19:50.085
and that is a bite mark.

19:50.085 --> 19:52.398
The inflammation's running
all the way up your arm.

19:52.398 --> 19:54.641
I think you got bit by
a black widow spider.

19:54.641 --> 19:56.574
We might have some
antivenom around,

19:56.574 --> 19:58.507
so just hang on, Reggie.

19:58.507 --> 19:59.301
Reggie!

20:10.312 --> 20:12.211
- Off belay.
- Bishop, they're in there.

20:14.109 --> 20:16.145
We have eyes on them.
Send down the stokes.

20:16.145 --> 20:17.664
Copy that.
The stokes won't fit,

20:17.664 --> 20:18.872
so we're sending the KED.

20:18.872 --> 20:20.219
Okay.

20:27.433 --> 20:28.744
What the hell?

20:28.744 --> 20:30.850
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, you're okay.

20:30.850 --> 20:32.231
You're okay,
you're okay, you're okay.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.439
- What's going on?
- Hey, we're with the SFD.

20:33.439 --> 20:35.579
You had a little fall, okay?

20:35.579 --> 20:37.339
What's your name?

20:37.339 --> 20:38.927
Sara Grossman.

20:38.927 --> 20:40.860
I go by Stella Trix.

20:40.860 --> 20:43.103
Yeah, hi, Stella.
Do you remember his name?

20:43.103 --> 20:45.451
- Brenton.
- Ah--ow!

20:45.451 --> 20:47.107
Oh, man.
- Don't move, buddy.

20:47.107 --> 20:48.799
I got you.
Don't move, don't move.

20:48.799 --> 20:50.456
I got you.
- Stella, are you okay?

20:50.456 --> 20:52.009
I'm okay.

20:52.009 --> 20:54.356
We fell.
I remember we fell.

20:54.356 --> 20:55.702
How did you find us?

20:55.702 --> 20:58.291
We used your live feed.
Is it still recording?

20:58.291 --> 20:59.603
Stella, are you
sure you're okay?

20:59.603 --> 21:00.949
Lay down, lay down.
Lay down.

21:00.949 --> 21:02.295
Stella, are you sure
you're okay?

21:02.295 --> 21:04.297
- Where's my phone?
- No, okay.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.368
I'll find it for you.
Ah--

21:06.368 --> 21:08.128
He has a severely
injured ankle.

21:08.128 --> 21:10.303
It might be dislocated.
I can barely feel a pulse.

21:10.303 --> 21:11.718
Okay, we can't
treat him down here.

21:11.718 --> 21:13.133
All right,
so we take him first.

21:13.133 --> 21:14.376
No.
No, no, no, take Stella.

21:14.376 --> 21:15.377
Take Stella first.

21:15.377 --> 21:16.654
No, I can't go
without my phone.

21:16.654 --> 21:18.000
Okay, Brenton, listen to me.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.450
You don't wanna lose
your foot, all right?

21:19.450 --> 21:21.141
We've gotta take you up
to evaluate it better.

21:21.141 --> 21:23.247
Both civilians are
alert and oriented.

21:23.247 --> 21:24.697
One has head trauma
and a dislocated ankle.

21:24.697 --> 21:26.215
Copy that.

21:26.215 --> 21:27.458
Sullivan, be ready on triage.
- Yep.

21:27.458 --> 21:29.184
She's gonna be okay.
You guys related?

21:29.184 --> 21:31.324
No, we just work together.
He's my camera guy.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.153
- Stella...
- Brenton, go.

21:33.153 --> 21:35.294
I need to find my phone.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.055
Hey, guys,
if you can hear me,

21:38.055 --> 21:39.815
<i>if this is still alive...</i>

21:39.815 --> 21:41.576
Okay, got it.

21:41.576 --> 21:43.336
This is Stella Trix.

21:43.336 --> 21:45.752
I'm currently streaming from
the bottom of a freaking cave.

21:45.752 --> 21:47.892
I'm okay.

21:47.892 --> 21:50.101
I think my toe is broken.

21:50.101 --> 21:52.241
But we're currently
being rescued right now

21:52.241 --> 21:54.520
by some incredible
first responders.

21:54.520 --> 21:56.522
I'm sorry. This is
gonna be uncomfortable.

21:56.522 --> 21:58.247
All set!
- Copy that.

21:58.247 --> 22:00.077
Up on the hoist.
Nice and slow.

22:00.077 --> 22:02.010
Let's go.
Easy does it.

22:02.010 --> 22:04.323
My cameraman, Brenton,

22:04.323 --> 22:06.186
is currently
being hoisted up right now.

22:06.186 --> 22:08.879
Stay tuned for more updates.

22:08.879 --> 22:10.915
Make sure to leave us
a comment and subscribe.

22:12.503 --> 22:14.540
Reggie.
Reggie!

22:14.540 --> 22:16.093
Reggie, can you hear me?

22:16.093 --> 22:17.163
Can you hear me?
- My head.

22:17.163 --> 22:18.613
Okay.
No, It's okay, it's okay.

22:18.613 --> 22:19.993
Seattle Pres
is sending an aid car.

22:19.993 --> 22:21.029
They'll be here soon.

22:21.029 --> 22:22.858
I...

22:22.858 --> 22:24.343
Okay, I don't
think we can wait.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.034
We need the antivenom fast.
Can you walk?

22:26.034 --> 22:28.105
Come on.
- Oh-oh-oh-oh!

22:28.105 --> 22:29.727
I can't do it, Doc.

22:29.727 --> 22:31.039
That's okay.

22:32.281 --> 22:33.904
You are at risk for
seizures or worse,

22:33.904 --> 22:35.733
so I need you to
keep talking to me

22:35.733 --> 22:36.872
so that I know
that you're okay.

22:36.872 --> 22:38.218
- Okay.
- You got me, Reggie?

22:38.218 --> 22:39.875
- Okay.
- Okay.

22:41.049 --> 22:42.706
Talk to me, Reggie.

22:42.706 --> 22:45.398
Okay.

22:45.398 --> 22:46.641
There you go.

22:49.333 --> 22:50.955
Chief, any news
from Gray Sloan?

22:50.955 --> 22:52.750
No casualties reported.

22:52.750 --> 22:54.476
That's all I know, okay?

22:54.476 --> 22:56.202
All right.
Montgomery, Bishop is clear.

22:56.202 --> 22:57.755
You can get ready
to send Stella.

22:57.755 --> 22:59.067
Strap her in.

22:59.067 --> 23:01.207
She gonna be okay?
Stella?

23:01.207 --> 23:03.243
She's going to
be okay, all right?

23:03.243 --> 23:05.591
You need to make
sure that you don't

23:05.591 --> 23:07.593
move that leg or that ankle.

23:07.593 --> 23:10.492
I'm going to give you
something for the pain.

23:10.492 --> 23:12.494
So how long have you guys
been working together?

23:12.494 --> 23:14.600
- Seven years.
- That's a long time.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.325
It's just like family, huh?

23:16.325 --> 23:18.673
Yeah, I'm actually
her boyfriend.

23:18.673 --> 23:22.124
Don't tell anybody
I just told you that.

23:22.124 --> 23:24.955
Her whole platform
is based on this idea

23:24.955 --> 23:26.819
that she's single
and on adventures.

23:26.819 --> 23:29.131
But it's a lie.

23:29.131 --> 23:31.513
She's kept our relationship
a secret for seven years.

23:31.513 --> 23:33.688
Well, hold this for me.

23:33.688 --> 23:35.621
There you go.

23:35.621 --> 23:38.278
And, uh, I'm not going
to tell anybody, don't worry.

23:38.278 --> 23:42.282
Listen, I'm gonna...

23:42.282 --> 23:44.112
slowly move your ankle,
all right?

23:44.112 --> 23:45.631
Ah, ah, ah.

23:45.631 --> 23:48.254
Hey, Captain, I need another
set of hands over here.

23:48.254 --> 23:50.290
Copy you.
Herrera, take the lead.

23:50.290 --> 23:52.431
We have to reset it.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.468
I'm not even a camera guy.

23:55.468 --> 23:56.883
Are we clear from the bottom?

23:56.883 --> 23:58.989
I quit my job because
she wanted to become...

23:58.989 --> 24:01.716
- Clear.
- Internet famous.

24:01.716 --> 24:03.545
So I got a camera,

24:03.545 --> 24:05.892
and I read a book on lighting,

24:05.892 --> 24:07.446
and I'll even lay down in
the middle of the road

24:07.446 --> 24:09.620
just to make sure she gets
the perfect shot.

24:09.620 --> 24:12.451
But I cannot post the photo of
us on my page together

24:12.451 --> 24:17.007
or just hold her hand
in public.

24:17.007 --> 24:19.527
I mean, could you
live like that?

24:20.666 --> 24:23.669
Um... I don't know, man.

24:23.669 --> 24:26.188
Listen, this is going
to hurt, Brenton, okay?

24:26.188 --> 24:28.156
- Okay.
- So on the count of three.

24:28.156 --> 24:29.744
You ready?
Take a deep breath.

24:29.744 --> 24:31.573
- Okay.
- All right, ready?

24:31.573 --> 24:34.956
One, two, three.

24:34.956 --> 24:37.027
Aah!

24:37.027 --> 24:38.477
Here we go!

24:38.477 --> 24:39.926
- All right.
- You did great.

24:42.929 --> 24:44.206
I think I see my phone.

24:44.206 --> 24:46.001
Stella.
Hey, Stella, stop, hey.

24:46.001 --> 24:47.520
Stella, listen.
- Can you hear me?

24:47.520 --> 24:49.039
We're here to rescue you,
not your phone.

24:49.039 --> 24:50.765
I know, but it's my job.

24:50.765 --> 24:52.767
It's my life.

24:52.767 --> 24:54.009
All right.
Do not move.

24:54.009 --> 24:56.011
I'll get your phone.
- Thank you.

24:56.011 --> 24:59.532
My fans are all I've got.

24:59.532 --> 25:01.016
It's still live.

25:01.016 --> 25:03.225
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

25:03.225 --> 25:05.504
<i>So the last thing I thought
would happen today</i>

25:05.504 --> 25:07.402
<i>would be a near-death
experience.</i>

25:07.402 --> 25:09.542
Okay. Stella, you're all
clipped in ready to go.

25:09.542 --> 25:11.233
Okay, hang on.

25:11.233 --> 25:13.788
<i>This is a real-life
hero in real life,</i>

25:13.788 --> 25:15.203
<i>saving me in real time.</i>

25:15.203 --> 25:16.894
<i>So just leave a comment</i>

25:16.894 --> 25:18.793
<i>if you've ever had
an experience like this.</i>

25:18.793 --> 25:20.070
Put the phone away.
Here we go.

25:20.070 --> 25:21.485
I'm ready when you are.

25:53.655 --> 25:55.070
Hold up.

26:02.319 --> 26:04.321
You see that?
- Huh?

26:06.772 --> 26:08.843
- Is it...
- Maybe.

26:08.843 --> 26:10.430
Those sponges like that
can be used as a base

26:10.430 --> 26:12.605
to absorb accelerant.

26:12.605 --> 26:14.952
Okay, do you think this
would be enough evidence?

26:14.952 --> 26:16.954
They think they
can just smoke us out

26:16.954 --> 26:19.129
of our homes and our shops.

26:19.129 --> 26:21.856
They think... they think
they can bully us like this,

26:21.856 --> 26:23.754
you know?

26:23.754 --> 26:26.274
And that damn unit just ignores
my calls and my reports,

26:26.274 --> 26:27.793
but they don't even come
down to investigate?

26:27.793 --> 26:29.622
Okay, we're here now.

26:29.622 --> 26:30.796
Yeah, but if you didn't
turn the car around today,

26:30.796 --> 26:32.280
who would be here for Tomás?

26:32.280 --> 26:33.937
No one.

26:33.937 --> 26:35.732
It makes you want to punch
a hole through a wall.

26:35.732 --> 26:38.389
Okay, well, how about instead
we call, and we force them

26:38.389 --> 26:40.944
to look at the facts, right?
- They don't pay attention.

26:40.944 --> 26:42.324
Okay. Well, do you want
me to call or not?

26:42.324 --> 26:44.050
We can make them listen.
- Yes, call.

26:44.050 --> 26:44.810
- Okay. You want--
- Call.

26:44.810 --> 26:47.709
Okay.

26:54.233 --> 26:57.167
Nice and easy, nice and easy.

26:57.167 --> 26:58.893
Wait, my followers
need to see this.

26:58.893 --> 27:00.584
Hold on.
Let me just...

27:00.584 --> 27:03.587
Wait--stop the ascent!
Chief, stop the ascent.

27:03.587 --> 27:07.004
As you can see, I'm currently
on the side of a cliff

27:07.004 --> 27:08.454
being taken up to freedom.

27:08.454 --> 27:10.076
Stella, do not
touch that harness!

27:10.076 --> 27:11.733
<i>You gotta see this drop
that we survived.</i>

27:11.733 --> 27:13.010
Stella, no!

27:13.010 --> 27:14.494
Stop!
- Wait--whoa--

27:23.124 --> 27:24.021
Bishop's going
to try to reach us.

27:24.021 --> 27:25.816
- Copy.
- Oh, my head.

27:25.816 --> 27:27.369
Stella, listen to me.

27:27.369 --> 27:28.508
You've gotta lean back,
or you're never

27:28.508 --> 27:30.027
gonna fit through that hole.
- Wait, my phone.

27:30.027 --> 27:31.028
I dropped my phone.

27:31.028 --> 27:32.754
Stella, forget
about your phone!

27:32.754 --> 27:34.514
You're gonna fall!
- No. No, I can't.

27:34.514 --> 27:36.033
There are videos on there
that aren't backed up.

27:36.033 --> 27:38.380
Stella, forget the phone!

27:38.380 --> 27:40.589
What are you thinking?
- No, I can't.

27:40.589 --> 27:42.350
It's my life.
It's all I have.

27:42.350 --> 27:44.179
That's all you have?

27:44.179 --> 27:45.180
Dude, what the hell?

27:45.180 --> 27:47.631
Stella, you have me!

27:47.631 --> 27:50.876
I am your boyfriend
who shares a life with you!

27:50.876 --> 27:52.601
You have me!

27:52.601 --> 27:54.051
No, Brenton,
Brenton, shut up!

27:54.051 --> 27:56.226
It's still recording!
It's live!

27:56.226 --> 27:58.849
Stella, look.
Stella, look. Look at me.

27:58.849 --> 28:01.231
I got your phone, okay?
- Wait, is it still recording?

28:01.231 --> 28:03.854
<i>I need you to reach out
and grab Bishop's hand, okay?</i>

28:03.854 --> 28:05.407
- Is it still recording?
- Come on.

28:05.407 --> 28:08.272
Stella, reach up.

28:08.272 --> 28:09.273
Belay me down.

28:09.273 --> 28:11.241
I...I need to just...

28:11.241 --> 28:13.795
Stella, stop it.
I need you to focus.

28:13.795 --> 28:15.314
Good?
Okay.

28:16.902 --> 28:19.249
Nice and slow, nice and slow.

28:19.249 --> 28:20.353
- I just need it.
- Stella, come on.

28:20.353 --> 28:21.872
Take my hand.
Come on.

28:21.872 --> 28:23.046
- But I--
- Come on.

28:23.046 --> 28:24.495
Take it, Stella.

28:24.495 --> 28:26.532
- Just lean back.
- I just need my phone.

28:26.532 --> 28:27.533
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:30.398 --> 28:32.503
We got you, Bishop.
We got you.

28:32.503 --> 28:35.092
Stella, you need to listen to
my team and stop moving!

28:35.092 --> 28:36.611
- But I just--
- Okay, look.

28:36.611 --> 28:38.647
I've seen some of your
videos, all right?

28:38.647 --> 28:40.235
And I was under
the impression

28:40.235 --> 28:41.754
that you were
a caring and kind person.

28:41.754 --> 28:43.894
But that is not what I'm
witnessing here today, Stella.

28:43.894 --> 28:45.102
You are being selfish.

28:45.102 --> 28:47.277
And you're putting
people's lives in danger.

28:47.277 --> 28:50.659
You need to be the person
that you present online.

28:50.659 --> 28:52.523
<i>Be authentic.</i>

28:52.523 --> 28:54.767
<i>Forget about your damn phone
and start having some respect</i>

28:54.767 --> 28:57.114
for the people's lives
that are trying to save yours!

28:57.114 --> 29:00.083
Right now, reach up
and take her hand!

29:01.947 --> 29:02.948
Come on.

29:02.948 --> 29:03.949
Okay, okay.

29:03.949 --> 29:05.122
There you go.

29:05.122 --> 29:06.606
- Got you.
- Come on.

29:06.606 --> 29:08.608
Come on!
- All right, all right.

29:08.608 --> 29:09.955
Okay, okay.

29:09.955 --> 29:10.990
Reggie, you with me?

29:11.957 --> 29:13.786
Reggie, talk to me.

29:13.786 --> 29:16.927
There's a jar of
money in my garage

29:16.927 --> 29:18.791
back behind the table saw.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.794
It's for my wife.

29:21.794 --> 29:25.315
I saved it over 20 years
behind the table saw.

29:25.315 --> 29:27.627
Keep talking to me, Reggie.

29:27.627 --> 29:29.802
Keep talking.
- I hid it from her,

29:29.802 --> 29:32.322
the money, as a surprise.

29:32.322 --> 29:34.980
One day, I was going to
take her on a trip to Italy.

29:34.980 --> 29:39.501
She always wanted to ride in
one of those boats in Venice.

29:39.501 --> 29:42.435
But everything
always got in the way.

29:42.435 --> 29:44.127
Come on.
Where is it?

29:44.127 --> 29:45.784
Am I gonna die, Doc?

29:47.337 --> 29:49.615
Will I see my wife again?

29:49.615 --> 29:51.790
I love her so much.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.515
I don't want--

29:53.515 --> 29:55.932
Look, I don't know, Reggie,
okay? I don't know.

29:55.932 --> 29:58.175
You just have to believe that
you'll make it, all right?

29:58.175 --> 30:00.143
Like, I'm believing that
my wife is safe right now.

30:00.143 --> 30:02.352
No one can control
the chaos in this world.

30:02.352 --> 30:03.836
All we can do is just--
got it.

30:03.836 --> 30:05.320
I got it, Reggie.

30:07.771 --> 30:09.186
Look, I'm sorry, Reggie, okay?

30:09.186 --> 30:12.189
I'm doing the best I can
under the circumstances.

30:12.189 --> 30:13.673
And listen, this is antivenom.

30:13.673 --> 30:14.916
This is the antidote
to spider venom,

30:14.916 --> 30:16.953
and it is powerful stuff.

30:16.953 --> 30:20.508
So I have to tell you that
while it can save your life,

30:20.508 --> 30:22.027
it can cause serious reactions

30:22.027 --> 30:23.925
like making
your breathing worse

30:23.925 --> 30:26.203
or swelling up your airway

30:26.203 --> 30:29.103
or making
your whole body spasm.

30:29.103 --> 30:32.209
I...
don't care.

30:32.209 --> 30:34.211
Legally,
I just had to let you know.

30:34.211 --> 30:36.213
Please, give it to me.

30:36.213 --> 30:39.320
Nothing could be
worse than this.

30:39.320 --> 30:40.666
Okay.

30:43.669 --> 30:45.705
Here we go.

30:52.505 --> 30:54.128
I got you.

30:55.957 --> 30:57.717
Stella, how are you feeling?

30:57.717 --> 30:59.029
Any nausea,
shortness of breath?

30:59.029 --> 31:00.444
- No.
- All right.

31:00.444 --> 31:01.790
Grabbing an O2 tank.

31:01.790 --> 31:03.723
Stella, are you okay?

31:03.723 --> 31:05.518
I'm fine.

31:05.518 --> 31:07.175
Here.

31:07.175 --> 31:08.901
Oh.

31:08.901 --> 31:10.799
Oh, it's cracked.

31:12.077 --> 31:13.802
Stella, I can't
believe you did that.

31:13.802 --> 31:16.909
I know. Ha.
It was crazy.

31:16.909 --> 31:18.600
And it was all live too.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.086
I can't wait to see
the comments about it.

31:21.086 --> 31:22.432
This is totally gonna boost
what we were talking about.

31:22.432 --> 31:24.330
- Stella!
- Can you pass that med bag?

31:24.330 --> 31:26.229
You shouldn't have
tried to record that.

31:26.229 --> 31:27.644
Like, what were
you even thinking?

31:27.644 --> 31:29.646
Oh, my God.

31:29.646 --> 31:31.406
Oh, my God!

31:31.406 --> 31:33.098
Hey, hey, hey.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

31:33.098 --> 31:34.616
It's fine,
it's fine, it's fine.

31:34.616 --> 31:36.825
Oh, my God, babe,
they heard what you were saying

31:36.825 --> 31:37.826
about us dating.

31:37.826 --> 31:39.828
Stella, I'm...

31:39.828 --> 31:43.453
No, babe, they like it.

31:43.453 --> 31:46.939
Oh, my God.
Babe, they love it.

31:46.939 --> 31:48.907
They're freaking out right now.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.461
Oh, my gosh,
there's over 700 likes.

31:51.461 --> 31:55.085
Babe, oh, my God.

31:55.085 --> 31:56.638
Oh, my God, let's take
a selfie and post it.

31:56.638 --> 31:59.296
We need you to lay down so
we can finish examining you.

31:59.296 --> 32:01.298
- Babe, just smile really fast.
- No, Stella, I can't--

32:01.298 --> 32:02.368
I can't do this anymore.
- Do what?

32:02.368 --> 32:04.853
I can't live like this.

32:04.853 --> 32:07.304
You don't wanna be with me
to be with me.

32:07.304 --> 32:09.306
Now you wanna be with me

32:09.306 --> 32:11.964
because it's gonna boost
your followers. No!

32:11.964 --> 32:14.449
Stella, lay back down,
please, so we can help you.

32:17.038 --> 32:18.453
But wait.

32:18.453 --> 32:20.110
We talked about this.

32:20.110 --> 32:22.561
You... you helped me
build this platform, like--

32:22.561 --> 32:25.460
I'm tired of being in
second place with you, Stella.

32:25.460 --> 32:28.808
I...I would literally
do anything for you.

32:28.808 --> 32:31.639
Clearly in life or death situations,

32:31.639 --> 32:34.331
I choose you.

32:34.331 --> 32:37.645
But you, you also choose you.

32:37.645 --> 32:39.543
You choose your fans.

32:39.543 --> 32:41.476
You never choose me.

32:41.476 --> 32:42.995
Wait.

32:42.995 --> 32:44.755
Stella, if you don't
lay down right now,

32:44.755 --> 32:46.585
we're going to
have to sedate you.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.726
Brenton, wait.

32:49.726 --> 32:51.797
No.
I'm done.

32:51.797 --> 32:55.007
Wait, Brenton, I...

32:55.007 --> 32:56.767
Brenton.

34:35.107 --> 34:37.454
Hey, we worked
well together today.

34:37.454 --> 34:39.077
Just like in the old days.

34:45.048 --> 34:47.119
- Carina isn't picking up.
- I'm texting Lauren right now.

34:47.119 --> 34:48.845
Any news on the radio?

34:48.845 --> 34:50.709
My deputy says no updates.

34:50.709 --> 34:52.297
But there's a detour
around Grey Sloan.

34:52.297 --> 34:53.436
We're going have
to go the long way.

34:53.436 --> 34:54.920
Let me out.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.094
We're in the
middle of the street.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.198
We're ten blocks
from Grey Sloan.

34:57.198 --> 34:58.441
It'll be faster if I run.

34:59.614 --> 35:00.788
Let her out.

35:00.788 --> 35:02.893
You sure you're okay?

35:02.893 --> 35:04.895
I will be.
Just need to get to Carina.

35:07.484 --> 35:09.831
It's a pretty classic
case of arson, actually.

35:09.831 --> 35:11.971
But I can see how it
might have been missed.

35:11.971 --> 35:13.387
Well, it shouldn't
have been missed.

35:13.387 --> 35:15.147
Okay, what happens next?

35:15.147 --> 35:16.838
There will be
an investigation.

35:16.838 --> 35:18.461
Okay, and how will
you track them down?

35:18.461 --> 35:21.015
They can trace previous
fires, but charges are slow.

35:21.015 --> 35:23.051
Okay, there's been a couple
of other places in the area

35:23.051 --> 35:24.743
that have gone up recently.

35:24.743 --> 35:26.331
If I give you their addresses,
can you check them out?

35:26.331 --> 35:27.642
There really
has to be a reason

35:27.642 --> 35:29.817
to reopen cases like this.
- Well, there is a reason.

35:29.817 --> 35:31.957
All of these businesses had
offers to purchase their lots

35:31.957 --> 35:33.407
by the same real estate firm.

35:33.407 --> 35:34.580
Maybe they couldn't
buy them out,

35:34.580 --> 35:35.961
so they burned them out, right?

35:35.961 --> 35:37.756
That's a bold accusation.

35:37.756 --> 35:41.656
Look, man, this is a personal
case for me, all right?

35:41.656 --> 35:43.175
This is where I grew up,

35:43.175 --> 35:44.866
and I just want to
make sure that it

35:44.866 --> 35:47.490
gets the same kind of attention
as other places, you know?

35:50.527 --> 35:52.357
I'll see what I can
do about investigating

35:52.357 --> 35:54.013
the other locations.
- Thank you.

35:54.013 --> 35:55.601
- You got it.
- Thanks.

35:57.776 --> 35:59.364
But I feel fine now.

35:59.364 --> 36:01.193
You should go to the
hospital for observation

36:01.193 --> 36:02.712
just to make sure
that you don't have

36:02.712 --> 36:04.265
a second wave of reactions.

36:04.265 --> 36:06.681
Well, okay.
But I just want to go home.

36:06.681 --> 36:09.028
Reggie, go home after you
know you're in the clear.

36:09.028 --> 36:11.030
And you know what?

36:11.030 --> 36:13.723
When you get home, tell your
wife you love her, all right?

36:13.723 --> 36:15.621
Tell her about the
money jar in the garage.

36:15.621 --> 36:18.176
Tell her... just take her
on that vacation, okay?

36:18.176 --> 36:19.694
You never know
what's going to happen.

36:19.694 --> 36:21.109
Tomorrow is not promised.

36:21.109 --> 36:23.388
So just tell her everything.

36:23.388 --> 36:26.045
Buy the tickets.
And call an exterminator.

36:26.045 --> 36:28.047
Okay.
Thanks, Doc.

36:28.047 --> 36:29.117
All right.

36:40.094 --> 36:43.649
375,000 views, and it's
only been three hours.

36:43.649 --> 36:45.927
You were already ahead of
Robel Osman as of this morning.

36:45.927 --> 36:47.757
But this... this... is gonna
push you

36:47.757 --> 36:49.241
over the finish line,
my friend.

36:49.241 --> 36:51.312
"Mayoral candidate
Travis Montgomery

36:51.312 --> 36:53.107
"saves internet star
Stella Trix

36:53.107 --> 36:55.420
while speaking on authenticity
and human connection?"

36:55.420 --> 36:56.559
Okay, we need to
capitalize on this, yeah?

36:56.559 --> 36:58.216
No.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.251
I'm thinking we
put out a new ad.

36:59.251 --> 37:00.908
Start a hashtag: Be authentic.
- No.

37:00.908 --> 37:02.772
- We can campaign on issues...
- Eli, stop. Eli, stop!

37:02.772 --> 37:04.083
- Neighborhood solidarity.
- Stop it, okay?

37:04.083 --> 37:05.568
I'm not sleeping.
I'm not eating.

37:05.568 --> 37:07.501
I didn't start this whole
thing so I could win.

37:07.501 --> 37:09.503
I started it to make
sure that Dixon wouldn't.

37:09.503 --> 37:11.090
This whole thing's
out of control.

37:11.090 --> 37:12.437
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Travis, this is nothing, yeah?

37:12.437 --> 37:14.197
You got into this
race because you're

37:14.197 --> 37:15.957
passionate and altruistic.
Do you know how often

37:15.957 --> 37:18.339
a passionate and altruistic
person actually leads?

37:18.339 --> 37:20.307
Not very often.
- Okay, I got to work.

37:20.307 --> 37:21.756
Yes, so do I. I've got to
draft up a new press release.

37:21.756 --> 37:23.241
And you tell me what
you think, yeah?

37:23.241 --> 37:24.863
Look, 423,000 views.

37:24.863 --> 37:27.106
Travis, just--just
think about it.

37:32.146 --> 37:33.906
Herrera, what you
did this morning...

37:33.906 --> 37:35.598
Chief, I'm sorry.

37:35.598 --> 37:37.289
It was bold.

37:37.289 --> 37:38.980
You stuck your neck
out for your team.

37:38.980 --> 37:41.259
You questioned, and you
pushed back on authority

37:41.259 --> 37:43.122
for what you knew
to be right.

37:43.122 --> 37:44.952
You know,
I've worked with a lot

37:44.952 --> 37:47.126
of different kinds of people,
brave people who are

37:47.126 --> 37:48.956
willing to risk their life.

37:48.956 --> 37:50.716
But it's rare to meet someone
who's so willing to risk

37:50.716 --> 37:53.443
their reputation and their
rank in the way that you did,

37:53.443 --> 37:55.790
someone who's willing
to speak truth to power.

37:55.790 --> 37:58.137
You are not a follower.

37:58.137 --> 37:59.553
You're a leader.

38:00.795 --> 38:01.969
Thank you.

38:01.969 --> 38:03.557
If Station 19 remains intact,

38:03.557 --> 38:06.560
I want you to take Beckett's
place until he returns.

38:11.496 --> 38:14.292
Uh, wow, I, um...

38:15.672 --> 38:17.156
Look, I respect you.

38:17.156 --> 38:18.986
I really respect you.

38:18.986 --> 38:21.989
And I see you as a mentor.

38:21.989 --> 38:25.337
But... when I become captain
of this house,

38:25.337 --> 38:27.063
I want to stay
captain of this house.

38:27.063 --> 38:29.134
I've earned that job.

38:29.134 --> 38:31.343
I don't want it temporarily.

38:31.343 --> 38:33.380
Don't let the perfect
be the enemy of the good.

38:35.209 --> 38:38.177
I guess I'm just going
against the grain again.

38:38.177 --> 38:39.662
Gracefully.

38:41.526 --> 38:42.837
Okay.

38:44.425 --> 38:46.807
If anyone deserves it,
it's Sullivan.

38:46.807 --> 38:48.187
Everyone trusts him.

38:48.187 --> 38:50.845
And you two work well together.

39:12.039 --> 39:13.178
What's this?

39:13.178 --> 39:15.042
I thought you should have it.

39:15.042 --> 39:17.285
Tomás should have it.

39:17.285 --> 39:19.564
Yeah, you should
give it to him.

39:19.564 --> 39:21.531
He's lucky to have you.

39:25.086 --> 39:26.191
Come on, come on.

39:26.191 --> 39:27.882
Come on. Pick up.

39:27.882 --> 39:29.815
19, line up!

39:32.577 --> 39:35.442
Come on, baby.

39:39.584 --> 39:42.069
Let's go, 19.

39:42.069 --> 39:45.037
Screw it.

39:45.037 --> 39:47.557
<i>♪ In uncertain times...</i>

39:47.557 --> 39:50.215
This morning, I spoke to
you about what a mutiny means

39:50.215 --> 39:52.079
in a paramilitary structure.

39:52.079 --> 39:53.839
When we're asked
to follow rank,

39:53.839 --> 39:55.910
we're asked to trust our
leaders with our lives,

39:55.910 --> 39:59.120
<i>to blindly follow
in good faith.</i>

39:59.120 --> 40:01.122
Looking back,
I wish I had the stomach

40:01.122 --> 40:04.609
to do what you did,
to question,

40:04.609 --> 40:09.234
to stand your ground
in the face of a broken trust.

40:09.234 --> 40:11.132
I took over your
house today worried

40:11.132 --> 40:12.444
that I would find
a team that didn't

40:12.444 --> 40:13.859
know how to follow orders.

40:13.859 --> 40:15.447
But that is not
what I witnessed.

40:15.447 --> 40:19.865
Today, I saw a team who
cares deeply and always

40:19.865 --> 40:21.004
has each other's backs.

40:21.004 --> 40:22.937
Excuse me, excuse me!

40:22.937 --> 40:27.114
While Beckett is gone,
you will need a trusted leader.

40:30.462 --> 40:33.189
Lieutenant Ruiz,
today's unveiling of arson

40:33.189 --> 40:34.880
with Firefighter Hughes

40:34.880 --> 40:36.986
was a culmination of
your unrelenting pursuit

40:36.986 --> 40:38.712
of truth in District 1.

40:38.712 --> 40:41.266
<i>Your dedication,
your professionalism</i>

40:41.266 --> 40:43.164
has been exceptional,

40:43.164 --> 40:46.720
and it could be a huge win for
that community in settlements.

40:46.720 --> 40:49.826
Ruiz, the acting
captain position is yours,

40:49.826 --> 40:52.657
if you'll have it.

40:59.733 --> 41:01.320
I accept.

41:01.320 --> 41:03.737
Congrats, Captain.
You're dismissed.
