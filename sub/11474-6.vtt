WEBVTT

00:00.453 --> 00:02.021
Previously on "Hunters"...

00:02.053 --> 00:03.255
That's my wife.

00:03.289 --> 00:05.425
I'm afraid we can't
determine that yet either, Flynn.

00:05.457 --> 00:08.093
She could have been
killed months ago, even years.

00:08.125 --> 00:09.594
I'm gonna show you the truth.

00:09.628 --> 00:12.131
Daddy, no! Stop, stop!

00:12.164 --> 00:14.334
- This is what we are.
- You gave yourself a treatment.

00:14.366 --> 00:16.101
The treatment makes you vulnerable.

00:16.135 --> 00:17.403
He killed my wife.

00:17.435 --> 00:19.371
No, I am your wife.

00:19.404 --> 00:21.507
Shoot me, do it.

00:21.540 --> 00:22.675
Do it!

00:22.708 --> 00:25.444
Slavich's last words
to me were about Hunters

00:25.478 --> 00:27.647
being inside the ETU.

00:27.679 --> 00:28.914
We'd like to try and arrange a meeting

00:28.947 --> 00:30.549
with Brother Number Four?

00:30.583 --> 00:31.467
That's their leader.

00:31.588 --> 00:33.920
He's like the Bin
Laden of little green men.

00:35.755 --> 00:36.621
Is that Romanian?

00:36.654 --> 00:38.203
Are you able to make anything out?

00:38.204 --> 00:39.654
This one keeps repeating.

00:39.655 --> 00:40.726
Richard Seraphin.

00:40.759 --> 00:42.260
Director, Global Asset Management

00:42.294 --> 00:43.996
at the International Monetary Fund.

00:44.029 --> 00:45.998
If he's laundering
money for the Hunters...

00:46.030 --> 00:48.234
Then he's in contact
with their leadership.

00:48.267 --> 00:49.334
Brother Number Four.

08:35.732 --> 08:36.835
Brother.

08:38.436 --> 08:39.504
Welcome.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.913
The others will be overjoyed.

09:21.946 --> 09:24.482
Waited a long time for you.

09:24.516 --> 09:28.020
The others, where are they?

09:28.053 --> 09:31.023
We're everywhere.

Okay.

10:03.088 --> 10:05.623
Not so loud.

11:13.355 --> 11:15.536
_

11:22.334 --> 11:25.804
We've got Briggs'
initial report from the ground in Turkey.

11:25.837 --> 11:28.707
The drug money Seraphin
laundered for the Hunters

11:28.739 --> 11:30.908
was funneled through the IMF to here.

11:30.941 --> 11:32.310
A military prison in Turkey

11:32.343 --> 11:33.878
ten miles from the Syrian border.

11:33.911 --> 11:37.215
That's border as in
refugees and runaway ISIS brides.

11:37.248 --> 11:39.017
The funds were allegedly being used

11:39.050 --> 11:40.585
for a well-building program.

11:40.618 --> 11:42.521
I've seen the prison and surprise,

11:42.554 --> 11:43.722
it doesn't have any wells.

11:43.755 --> 11:45.824
- Not much water, either.
- Shocking.

11:45.857 --> 11:46.891
So who's collecting the money?

11:46.925 --> 11:49.460
The prison's warden, Sharif Amari.

11:49.493 --> 11:50.628
He's on the receiving end.

11:50.661 --> 11:53.898
Finnerman has approved
extraordinary rendition.

11:53.931 --> 11:56.000
You will rendezvous with
Briggs in country

11:56.034 --> 11:57.102
and extract the warden.

11:57.135 --> 11:58.537
Any local support?

11:58.569 --> 11:59.604
None.

11:59.637 --> 12:00.906
You'll be in a hostile area

12:00.939 --> 12:03.041
where no faction is all that fond of us.

12:03.074 --> 12:04.108
Expect a war zone.

12:04.141 --> 12:05.964
So we won't be greeted as liberators?

12:05.965 --> 12:08.180
I'd love to avoid getting beheaded.

12:08.213 --> 12:10.748
This warden could be our
Bin Laden's career.

12:10.781 --> 12:12.151
We nab him,

12:12.184 --> 12:15.021
he could lead us straight to Brother
Number Four's doorstep.

12:18.122 --> 12:19.324
You're late.

12:19.357 --> 12:21.894
We need to talk.

12:24.695 --> 12:27.899
You're looking well.

12:27.933 --> 12:29.401
- Rough few days.
- Yeah.

12:29.434 --> 12:31.170
Holed up alone drinking.

12:31.203 --> 12:33.072
How'd that work out for you?

12:34.372 --> 12:35.574
You were watching me.

12:35.607 --> 12:37.709
You went AWOL to find your wife.

12:40.212 --> 12:45.617
Briggs found traces of
Abby's blood in the hotel room.

12:50.122 --> 12:51.490
I shot her.

12:53.324 --> 12:54.693
To stop her from escaping?

12:57.561 --> 13:00.364
Something like that.

13:00.397 --> 13:03.435
You should have brought her in.

13:06.570 --> 13:09.175
Happy birthday. I love you.

13:22.253 --> 13:24.255
Yes, I should have.

13:25.524 --> 13:28.694
Well, I mean, if I found
out that if my wife was...

13:28.727 --> 13:32.097
Abby's not my wife.

13:32.130 --> 13:34.300
She never was.

13:36.101 --> 13:41.006
There's nothing left for
me to do here now, so, thanks.

13:41.039 --> 13:43.542
I've had a blast.

13:43.574 --> 13:46.444
I'm sorry to lose you.

13:46.478 --> 13:49.415
Especially when things are
just starting to get interesting.

13:52.083 --> 13:55.654
We have a strong lead
on the Hunter responsible.

13:55.686 --> 13:57.222
For what?

13:58.857 --> 14:00.425
Everything.

14:20.078 --> 14:21.814
You gotta work on your tan lines.

14:25.684 --> 14:27.319
Way past due.

14:29.154 --> 14:31.323
You heard what happened at the hotel?

14:31.356 --> 14:32.624
I heard Abby got away.

14:32.656 --> 14:33.492
You wanna ask about it?

14:33.525 --> 14:36.395
At least you didn't rip her apart.

14:40.431 --> 14:43.167
I'm always gearing up too soon.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.336
Then I just sit
around, armed to the teeth,

14:45.369 --> 14:47.372
bored out of my skull 'til go time.

14:48.872 --> 14:50.776
Flight to Turkey's not 'til 1600.

14:50.809 --> 14:51.677
Grab a drink?

14:51.709 --> 14:53.545
I think I had enough last night.

14:53.578 --> 14:58.449
Besides, I've got a
human-only policy from now on.

14:59.718 --> 15:02.285
I said drink, asshole.

15:17.301 --> 15:21.606
Alison, I just want you at your best.

15:21.640 --> 15:23.709
For my good, not yours.

15:23.742 --> 15:25.444
Right?

15:25.477 --> 15:27.411
You keep telling yourself that.

15:27.444 --> 15:30.015
You should be trying to find them mole.

15:40.891 --> 15:43.561
Ceausescu's regime will soon fall.

15:43.594 --> 15:46.831
The CIA believe we are pro-democracy
freedom fighters

15:46.864 --> 15:49.400
and foreign mercenaries helping
the Romanian cause.

15:49.434 --> 15:52.103
Their contact provides
us with valuable resources.

15:53.537 --> 15:57.276
But we have become
soldiers in a revolution

15:57.309 --> 15:59.611
in which we have no stake.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.683
Can we trust your CIA contact?

16:06.718 --> 16:10.856
He's a spy, not a saint, and also human.

16:11.622 --> 16:12.991
Brother.

16:13.024 --> 16:15.861
We gained much from this conflict,

16:15.893 --> 16:16.994
but it's time to move on.

16:17.027 --> 16:18.296
Da.

16:18.329 --> 16:20.098
Time to consider what benefits

16:20.131 --> 16:22.901
an allegiance with the
Russians might bring us.

16:30.108 --> 16:31.276
Anyone else wish to speak?

16:34.978 --> 16:37.549
We will not align
ourselves with the Russians.

16:37.582 --> 16:39.718
This struggle is our own.

16:50.027 --> 16:51.362
My CIA contact.

16:51.396 --> 16:53.564
This meeting is over.

17:07.512 --> 17:08.980
Musa.

17:09.913 --> 17:11.982
Good to see you as well, my friend.

17:13.718 --> 17:15.853
Let us walk.

17:23.462 --> 17:29.192
_

17:58.797 --> 17:59.899
Is there a problem?

17:59.931 --> 18:02.267
He wants to see your bag.

18:41.507 --> 18:43.743
He's not biting.

18:44.809 --> 18:46.211
Here.

18:46.245 --> 18:47.814
Try this.

18:48.546 --> 18:49.615
Hey.

19:03.728 --> 19:06.231
- Huh.
- You're welcome

19:08.734 --> 19:10.303
Briggs has visual on our warden.

19:11.437 --> 19:13.305
Apparently, Amari's got a love nest.

19:13.339 --> 19:14.841
Lucky, huh?

19:38.997 --> 19:41.401
Thanks.

19:44.169 --> 19:46.372
A doctor, seriously?

19:46.404 --> 19:48.106
Don't you have to be smart?

19:48.140 --> 19:50.776
Where's our guy.

19:50.808 --> 19:52.478
Upstairs, in his pied-Ã -terre.

19:52.510 --> 19:54.045
Wife and three kids at home.

19:54.078 --> 19:56.281
This is where he keeps his side piece.

19:56.314 --> 19:58.517
Shouldn't be too hard to extract him

19:58.551 --> 20:00.119
and question him about the IMF money

20:00.151 --> 20:01.487
while his pants are down.

20:01.488 --> 20:03.555
- We got a wire in the room?
- Hm-hm.

20:03.589 --> 20:05.191
How deep is he rolling?

20:05.224 --> 20:06.292
You tell me.

20:10.662 --> 20:11.663
Okay then.

20:11.697 --> 20:12.832
He's got a two-man detail,

20:12.864 --> 20:14.199
one guy watching the door,

20:14.232 --> 20:15.949
the other's gone for a smoke,

20:15.950 --> 20:17.103
should be back in five
minutes, 30 seconds.

20:17.135 --> 20:18.670
That is very specific.

20:18.703 --> 20:20.873
- He's smoking 100s.
- All right.

20:27.078 --> 20:29.548
Looks like the wife's not at home.

20:34.620 --> 20:36.722
Let's abort, we can
contact Jackson, get an audible.

20:36.755 --> 20:39.526
And give the mole another
chance to slip us up?

20:40.459 --> 20:41.427
She's a distraction.

20:41.459 --> 20:43.196
I say we roll with it.

20:45.898 --> 20:48.301
I thought you said
five-and-a-half, Briggs.

20:48.334 --> 20:51.270
He's mine. Take the side door.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.448
We're supposed to
render him, not kill him!

21:17.449 --> 21:18.231
He drew his weapon.

21:21.432 --> 21:22.535
Get them out of here!

21:22.567 --> 21:24.170
Go, go!

21:24.202 --> 21:26.504
You're okay. You're okay.

21:26.537 --> 21:29.107
My pack, my pack.

21:34.979 --> 21:36.015
Human.

21:36.047 --> 21:37.567
Who are you? What do you want?

21:37.583 --> 21:39.819
Shut up, we're asking the questions.

21:39.852 --> 21:41.621
I don't understand.

21:41.653 --> 21:43.622
Move your hand, move your hand.

21:43.655 --> 21:45.324
Where is Brother Number Four?

21:48.693 --> 21:50.395
Where is Brother Number Four?

21:50.429 --> 21:51.564
What is it?

21:51.596 --> 21:53.398
This symbol. I've seen it before.

21:53.431 --> 21:54.467
These cross swords.

21:54.499 --> 21:56.701
- It's the prison emblem.
- Yeah, I saw it.

21:56.735 --> 22:00.706
These shapes around it
curved sort of like a crescent moon,

22:00.738 --> 22:02.225
There were four of them.

22:02.226 --> 22:03.810
Brother Number Four, where is he?

22:05.244 --> 22:07.413
Where is he? Brother Number Four!

22:07.446 --> 22:09.449
Carroll.

22:13.852 --> 22:16.355
I know where he is.

22:45.950 --> 22:47.019
Do you understand?

22:48.953 --> 22:50.522
Very tenuous.

22:53.792 --> 22:56.829
Tell me you understand, Amari.

22:56.862 --> 22:59.498
I don't know the four brothers.

23:01.499 --> 23:04.335
Who are you
collecting the IMF money for?

23:04.369 --> 23:05.137
Who does it go to?

23:05.170 --> 23:06.738
Please, I must see a doctor.

23:06.772 --> 23:07.773
No, you're gonna be fine.

23:07.805 --> 23:09.433
Unless you don't answer our questions.

23:09.434 --> 23:12.511
Tell us where the IMF money is going,

23:12.544 --> 23:15.348
and don't you dare say wells.

23:26.324 --> 23:27.860
- Tell us!
- Musa!

23:28.861 --> 23:30.896
To Musa is where the money goes.

23:30.929 --> 23:32.797
Musa who? Musa who?

23:32.831 --> 23:36.535
Musa Wazari. I don't
know him by other name.

23:36.567 --> 23:38.804
Where do we find this Musa?

23:38.836 --> 23:40.739
Where do we find this Musa?!

23:40.773 --> 23:42.141
He lives in my prison.

23:42.173 --> 23:45.076
- He's a prisoner?
- No.

23:45.110 --> 23:46.344
He stays there for safety.

23:46.378 --> 23:49.915
He claims to be freedom
fighter from Romania.

23:49.948 --> 23:51.816
A man on the run.

23:51.850 --> 23:55.187
He pays me to keep him
safe, safe from the outside world.

23:55.219 --> 23:59.190
But then, he becomes... seytan.

23:59.224 --> 24:00.391
The devil.

24:00.424 --> 24:03.561
He corrupts my
guards. He kills my prisoners.

24:03.594 --> 24:07.432
The strongest of men, parts
of their spine go missing.

24:08.499 --> 24:10.102
There's nothing I can do.

24:10.134 --> 24:13.738
I go to my superiors, Musa will kill me.

24:13.772 --> 24:16.008
I go to the police, they
will kill my family.

24:16.041 --> 24:18.677
The Hunter who had the
baby spoke Romanian.

24:18.709 --> 24:20.011
We can help you.

24:20.045 --> 24:21.846
We can get this man out of your prison,

24:21.880 --> 24:23.482
but we need to a way in.

24:23.515 --> 24:24.917
Can you do that?

24:24.949 --> 24:27.952
No one can ever enter his room.

24:27.986 --> 24:29.455
He's always protected,

24:29.487 --> 24:32.357
guards outside his door day and night.

24:32.391 --> 24:33.993
You will never get him alone.

24:34.026 --> 24:35.663
You leave it to us.

24:36.348 --> 24:38.062
I'll get Jackson on the horn.

24:38.095 --> 24:42.901
This rendition just got
hell of a lot more interesting.

24:42.934 --> 24:44.169
We're not calling ETU.

24:44.202 --> 24:45.670
What? Why not?

24:45.703 --> 24:47.272
If there is a mole and we call it in,

24:47.305 --> 24:48.873
they'll take Musa off.

24:48.907 --> 24:50.168
He gets away, it's game over.

24:50.305 --> 24:52.044
If we don't call it
in, we have no support.

24:52.076 --> 24:53.112
We're doing okay so far.

24:53.144 --> 24:55.113
But a raid on the military prison

24:55.147 --> 24:57.083
with no backup, that's insane.

24:57.216 --> 24:58.317
Musa doesn't know we're coming.

24:58.350 --> 25:01.353
I'd rather have
tactical advantage than numbers.

25:01.385 --> 25:03.189
You contact Jackson,

25:03.221 --> 25:04.355
tell him we have his white whale?

25:04.389 --> 25:07.693
Regan thinks it might tip off the mole.

25:07.726 --> 25:08.828
I'll handle it.

25:08.861 --> 25:10.728
Were you not even gonna hear me out?

25:10.762 --> 25:13.299
About cutting communication
with our commanding officer?

25:13.332 --> 25:14.699
No.

25:17.236 --> 25:18.337
Screw you guys.

25:22.074 --> 25:24.310
Sir, Musa Wazari,

25:24.343 --> 25:26.179
does that name mean anything to you?

25:28.045 --> 25:29.014
Musa?

25:29.046 --> 25:30.315
Musa Wazari.

25:30.349 --> 25:32.651
Possible pseudonym for
Brother Number Four.

25:32.683 --> 25:33.818
We have intel

25:33.852 --> 25:35.888
he may be holed up at
the warden's prison.

25:35.920 --> 25:37.823
We'll run the name.

25:37.855 --> 25:40.225
Pull up Hydra, run Musa Wazari.

25:40.258 --> 25:41.360
Any tags to go with that

25:41.392 --> 25:42.872
like, "Musa the Jackal" or something?

25:42.894 --> 25:45.297
Just run it, Jules.

26:10.322 --> 26:13.092
You okay, sir?

26:13.124 --> 26:14.626
We found him.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.195
Brother Number Four?

26:16.228 --> 26:18.229
Holy shit, that's him?

26:18.263 --> 26:21.667
The extraction plan just changed.

26:21.699 --> 26:22.901
Run some scenarios.

26:22.934 --> 26:24.302
Belfast '76?

26:24.335 --> 26:25.403
Sure, why not?

26:25.437 --> 26:27.198
Start there and
we'll tweak some protocols.

26:27.330 --> 26:31.043
I'll let Langley know we're
gonna need a drone.

27:14.853 --> 27:16.988
Another shipment's on its way.

27:17.022 --> 27:20.492
Should be here before Bucharest.

27:20.525 --> 27:24.362
This would be a great
victory for your people, Musa.

27:24.395 --> 27:28.266
The tide's turning, and not just here.

27:29.735 --> 27:33.305
Have you given any thought
to what comes next for you?

27:33.337 --> 27:35.907
After the revolution is over?

27:35.940 --> 27:38.978
You're a very skilled man.

27:39.010 --> 27:43.449
You would be valuable to
a newly formed military.

27:43.481 --> 27:44.649
You're an excellent leader.

27:44.682 --> 27:49.154
Calm, authoritative, well-read.

27:51.321 --> 27:53.758
I hear you've lost a number
of your men to the Russians.

27:53.792 --> 27:58.230
Now, if you were to
consider working for the CIA,

27:58.263 --> 28:01.834
I know you would be gladly welcome.

28:01.866 --> 28:04.103
And we would make it worth your while.

28:08.239 --> 28:11.209
Thank you, but my
fight lies with my people.

28:14.946 --> 28:16.582
And we support you.

28:16.614 --> 28:18.383
To your victory, Musa.

28:18.417 --> 28:19.385
Noroc.

28:19.418 --> 28:20.319
And for you,

28:20.352 --> 28:22.420
a symbol of our success together.

28:28.226 --> 28:29.361
Noroc.

28:29.393 --> 28:31.863
Thank you.

28:43.608 --> 28:45.632
Jackson's scrambling a drone.

28:45.633 --> 28:48.083
Contingency if tomorrow's
raid goes sideways.

28:48.117 --> 28:50.920
And it will if the mole tells
Musa that we're coming.

28:50.952 --> 28:52.254
We need to follow protocol.

28:52.287 --> 28:53.421
We're not throwing out the rulebook

28:53.455 --> 28:54.957
because Regan had a hunch.

28:54.989 --> 28:56.157
Regan was right about the symbol

28:56.190 --> 28:57.293
on the warden's jacket.

28:57.325 --> 28:58.361
Oh, was she?

28:58.393 --> 29:00.429
Well, maybe she
already knew where Musa was.

29:00.461 --> 29:01.530
This whole mole thing...

29:01.563 --> 29:04.467
She saved my life at the music store.

29:04.499 --> 29:06.301
Why would a traitor do that?

29:06.334 --> 29:08.804
She'll have her reasons.

29:10.104 --> 29:12.073
Hunters knew we were coming in Columbia.

29:12.107 --> 29:14.243
She took out Slavich before we
had a chance to question her.

29:14.275 --> 29:16.312
Regan got us to Mrs.
Slavich in the first place.

29:16.344 --> 29:18.813
Oh, yeah, with that
clickety-clack bullshit.

29:18.846 --> 29:20.715
You know Jules thinks
Regan knows more about

29:20.748 --> 29:23.518
the Hunter language than
she's letting on.

29:23.552 --> 29:25.288
Come on, Carroll, think about it.

29:25.321 --> 29:26.322
She's one of them.

29:26.354 --> 29:28.690
Put yourself in her shoes.

29:28.724 --> 29:30.626
I mean, you're alone,

29:30.659 --> 29:34.162
fighting against your own
kind, against yourself.

29:35.464 --> 29:37.033
They sent me home to fight my people,

29:37.065 --> 29:38.567
I wouldn't do it.

29:38.601 --> 29:41.162
It explains to me why Regan
didn't want to call this in.

29:44.607 --> 29:46.008
We need to tell Jackson.

29:46.041 --> 29:47.409
Oh, hell no.

29:47.442 --> 29:49.544
Regan's his girl.

29:49.577 --> 29:52.447
He's not gonna believe me without proof.

29:52.480 --> 29:56.552
And tomorrow, we'll
know, one way or another.

30:27.548 --> 30:29.484
Musa controls this block.

30:29.517 --> 30:31.720
He has only one exit from his cell here,

30:31.754 --> 30:33.488
but it is always guarded.

30:33.522 --> 30:36.492
If you can free the
prisoners from these other blocks,

30:36.525 --> 30:38.393
this will draw his guards away from him,

30:38.427 --> 30:39.996
he will have no choice but to flee.

30:40.028 --> 30:41.396
And that's when we grab him.

30:42.797 --> 30:45.967
Here. These will get you in.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.769
Now get rid of this monster.

30:47.803 --> 30:49.871
Keys to the kingdom.

30:49.904 --> 30:51.773
Briggs will light the fuse.

30:53.809 --> 30:57.613
The biggest threat
humanity has ever known,

30:57.646 --> 30:59.849
we put the guns in Musa's hands.

30:59.881 --> 31:01.950
How can you be sure it's the same Musa?

31:01.984 --> 31:04.086
Maybe you were
dealing with the actual human

31:04.119 --> 31:06.188
before this Musa took over his body.

31:06.220 --> 31:08.524
It's him.

31:08.556 --> 31:11.393
Musa was my asset.

31:11.427 --> 31:13.161
I armed his people, I trained him,

31:13.195 --> 31:15.698
I stood in his house and
toasted his good fortune.

31:15.730 --> 31:19.401
Truss, it was 20 years before
we found the first Hunter body.

31:19.435 --> 31:21.387
You couldn't possibly have known

31:21.388 --> 31:23.538
that an anti-communist cell
leader wasn't human.

31:23.572 --> 31:25.207
I knew he was dangerous.

31:25.239 --> 31:27.476
A potential enemy if the tide turned.

31:27.508 --> 31:29.477
We back dozens of freedom fighters

31:29.511 --> 31:30.846
and regimes all over the world.

31:30.879 --> 31:33.115
And never learned our lesson!

31:33.148 --> 31:35.059
We didn't just create a monster,

31:35.060 --> 31:37.652
we helped build a terrorist
organization made from them.

31:37.686 --> 31:39.722
We worked together with those people

31:39.755 --> 31:41.189
to overthrow brutal regimes.

31:41.223 --> 31:43.959
But what they chose to do after that,

31:43.992 --> 31:45.394
it's not our responsibility.

31:45.427 --> 31:47.630
You can pass the buck
all you want to, Ruth.

31:47.662 --> 31:49.964
Whatever the Hunters have
done under Musa's command,

31:49.997 --> 31:52.901
the bombings, the drug
running, the murders.

31:52.935 --> 31:55.004
Our history with Musa never happened.

31:56.205 --> 31:58.506
And neither did this conversation.

31:58.540 --> 32:00.543
Are we clear?

32:02.410 --> 32:04.979
Good.

32:05.013 --> 32:06.849
You have a drone aimed at the prison?

32:08.283 --> 32:10.486
For a short window.

32:10.518 --> 32:13.455
The minute the Turks cry
foul, our drone gets pulled.

32:13.488 --> 32:15.990
If the extraction doesn't
succeed in time, we strike.

32:16.024 --> 32:17.592
Either way,

32:17.625 --> 32:21.763
Musa does not walk out of that
prison of his own accord.

32:23.165 --> 32:25.167
I sleep soundly, Truss.

32:25.199 --> 32:26.835
But if you feel the need to atone

32:26.869 --> 32:28.838
for what you did a lifetime ago,

32:28.871 --> 32:31.040
now's your chance.

32:37.579 --> 32:40.448
Allah Hu-Akbar.

32:40.482 --> 32:41.584
Allah Hu-Akbar.

32:42.750 --> 32:44.953
Allah Hu-Akbar.

32:46.889 --> 32:48.424
Allah Hu-Akbar.

32:49.490 --> 32:50.792
Allah Hu-Akbar.

32:52.127 --> 32:53.996
Allah Hu-Akbar.

32:54.028 --> 32:56.097
And he said take thy son Isaac,

32:56.131 --> 33:00.902
who thou loves, and offer
him there for a burnt offering.

33:02.304 --> 33:04.073
And in Kings,

33:04.105 --> 33:06.275
God asking for the blood sacrifice

33:06.307 --> 33:09.578
of Solomon's own child
as an act of obedience.

33:15.284 --> 33:16.819
God tests us all.

33:16.852 --> 33:20.054
Allah Hu-Akbar.

33:20.088 --> 33:22.558
Allah Hu-Akbar.

34:23.384 --> 34:25.187
Fuse is lit.

34:32.393 --> 34:33.661
We move along block A,

34:33.694 --> 34:36.664
unlock the cells, release the
prisoners, instant chaos.

34:36.697 --> 34:38.466
Musa won't know what hit him.

34:43.804 --> 34:45.274
He wants to see you.

35:11.299 --> 35:14.169
I'm sorry, there is
a problem, Mr. Wazari.

35:14.201 --> 35:15.837
You must leave at once.

35:20.708 --> 35:22.111
The Americans, they're coming.

35:22.143 --> 35:27.582
We can't keep them out of your wing.

35:27.616 --> 35:29.251
You have betrayed me, Amari.

35:29.283 --> 35:32.053
Never. I'm warning you.

35:32.087 --> 35:33.756
I'm trying to save you.

35:33.788 --> 35:37.025
Please, you must believe me.

36:03.018 --> 36:04.186
So far, so good.

36:09.223 --> 36:10.959
Musa's guards are fleeing his wing.

36:11.759 --> 36:12.861
Tough night?

36:12.893 --> 36:15.596
Got a bruise, another guy got a riot.

36:15.629 --> 36:17.065
Flynn and I will push
in and smoke Musa out.

36:17.098 --> 36:18.667
Briggs, you're on your own for block D.

36:18.699 --> 36:19.968
Copy that.

36:20.002 --> 36:22.638
I'll release more
prisoners, add bodies to the herd.

36:30.444 --> 36:33.181
The UAV is about to
enter Turkish airspace.

36:33.214 --> 36:35.917
How long
until they reach Musa's wing?

36:35.951 --> 36:37.052
Any minute.

36:37.085 --> 36:39.254
Patching in the GoPro feed now.

36:42.357 --> 36:44.627
There, Musa's wing!

36:45.326 --> 36:46.661
Move!

37:32.107 --> 37:35.311
You're not... you're not real!

38:00.268 --> 38:02.004
Flynn, Regan, can you hear me?

38:02.036 --> 38:04.605
Flynn, Regan, can you hear me?

38:13.781 --> 38:15.817
Human. But it doesn't
mean the rest of them are.

38:15.850 --> 38:16.884
Are you all right?

38:16.917 --> 38:18.186
I'm okay, I'm good.

38:18.219 --> 38:20.355
I saw Musa up on the second floor.

38:20.388 --> 38:22.056
I don't know which way he
went, there's too much smoke.

38:22.089 --> 38:22.990
He made us.

38:23.024 --> 38:25.361
We need to cut off the exit routes. Go!

39:10.019 --> 39:12.522
- The drone is two minutes out.
- Blast radius estimates?

39:12.555 --> 39:15.191
Civilian casualties
at 200, conservatively.

39:15.224 --> 39:18.762
If Regan, Flynn, and
Briggs don't get out soon...

39:21.898 --> 39:22.966
Move!

39:24.032 --> 39:25.668
Move!

39:27.269 --> 39:28.338
Where's Regan?

39:28.371 --> 39:30.506
She saw Musa then lost sight of him.

39:30.539 --> 39:32.307
We split up.

39:32.340 --> 39:35.277
Regan, have you located the target?

39:35.311 --> 39:37.146
Don't be afraid.

39:37.179 --> 39:39.983
I won't hurt you.

39:40.016 --> 39:40.883
You know who I am.

39:40.916 --> 39:43.785
Brother Number Four. Musa.

39:43.818 --> 39:46.255
She's not answering. You
know what that means.

39:46.289 --> 39:47.790
It means she's not answering.

39:47.822 --> 39:50.859
I haven't seen you since you were small.

39:50.892 --> 39:52.461
You're all grown up now.

39:52.494 --> 39:55.831
And here you are. You came to me.

40:02.070 --> 40:05.974
You understand me because
you're one of us.

40:06.008 --> 40:09.679
I am your brother. You belong to me.

40:15.918 --> 40:16.885
Move, move!

40:16.918 --> 40:18.720
Musa's guards. With me!

40:36.938 --> 40:40.042
Clicking.

40:40.075 --> 40:41.443
The drone is in position.

40:41.476 --> 40:43.445
What are your orders?

40:44.813 --> 40:46.115
He's still inside?

40:49.017 --> 40:50.153
Yes.

40:58.728 --> 41:00.262
The drone is now armed.

41:04.432 --> 41:05.568
Do you want to fire?

41:29.224 --> 41:31.427
What the f...

41:32.260 --> 41:33.329
Abort.

41:35.430 --> 41:36.766
Abort, Briggs, Carroll,

41:36.798 --> 41:37.900
get transport and get out of there.

41:37.932 --> 41:41.470
That's an order.

41:41.503 --> 41:45.240
Carroll, fall back.

41:50.479 --> 41:51.747
- Clear!
- Clear!

41:58.421 --> 41:59.489
I can't.

41:59.521 --> 42:00.922
You go.

42:00.956 --> 42:02.594
- Regan's alone.
- You heard Jackson.

42:02.595 --> 42:03.726
We need to get out of here.

42:03.758 --> 42:05.027
I'm not leaving her.
