WEBVTT

00:01.531 --> 00:02.931
Well,
we've reached the end--

00:03.308 --> 00:06.443
the final episode
of <i>The Spoils of Babylon.</i>

00:07.223 --> 00:10.041
It took me three years
to complete filming on <i>Spoils.</i>

00:10.465 --> 00:12.966
It was an emotionally
draining experience.

00:13.504 --> 00:16.605
By this time in production,
my wife, Lauoreighiya Samcake,

00:16.607 --> 00:19.575
who plays Cynthia,
was no longer my wife.

00:19.719 --> 00:21.619
Dirk Snowfield,
who played Devon,

00:21.659 --> 00:23.212
had converted to buddhism.

00:23.214 --> 00:27.149
And Marty Comanche was nearly
unreachable without medication.

00:27.151 --> 00:30.919
But here it is.
The great opera of two lives

00:30.921 --> 00:34.226
lived in fear of their desire
comes to a close.

00:34.457 --> 00:36.156
One more interesting tidbit.

00:36.660 --> 00:39.561
It's not often that I don
the clothes of the thespian

00:39.563 --> 00:42.564
and parade upon the board,
so to speak.

00:42.718 --> 00:46.602
The bard usually doth not goeth
upon his own stage,

00:46.604 --> 00:50.506
if you will,
but the cast and crew insisted.

00:50.508 --> 00:56.512
Tonight, you will see me
in the role of the Shah of Iran.

00:56.514 --> 00:59.248
It's but a trifle,
but is it not the trifles

00:59.250 --> 01:02.360
that give one's lives
greatest pleasures?

01:03.007 --> 01:05.307
I hope it adds
to your pleasure.

01:05.659 --> 01:08.460
Without any more ado,

01:08.993 --> 01:13.095
enjoy the grand finale
of <i>The Spoils of Babylon.</i>

01:13.784 --> 01:15.951
<i>Previously
on </i> The Spoils of Babylon <i>...</i>

01:16.267 --> 01:20.543
My name is Devon Morehouse.
My story is an epic one.

01:20.846 --> 01:22.946
Look, father,
there's someone walking.

01:22.978 --> 01:25.579
From now on,
your last name is Morehouse.

01:25.641 --> 01:26.936
It's been so long
since you kissed me.

01:26.952 --> 01:27.918
Don't you wanna?

01:27.970 --> 01:29.554
Devon, we struck oil!

01:29.600 --> 01:32.617
I want to introduce you
to Lady Anne York.

01:32.649 --> 01:34.148
What are you doing
with that fire?

01:35.569 --> 01:36.568
I saved the child.

01:36.645 --> 01:39.279
I kicked heroin.
I can't kick you.

01:39.326 --> 01:41.253
I'm dying, Devon.
Mama!

01:41.486 --> 01:42.252
Noooo!

01:42.523 --> 01:44.890
I want you to guide
this company going forward.

01:44.922 --> 01:46.426
She's gonna shut us down.

01:46.517 --> 01:47.683
I hate Devon Morehouse.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.725
He is your father.

01:50.142 --> 01:55.304
You tell your Shah that he
shall have his nuclear bomb.

01:55.306 --> 01:58.382
This is my life.
Or all that remains of it.

Dad.

03:16.727 --> 03:19.763
You have tears in your eyes.

03:20.391 --> 03:23.778
There's a kind of sadness in you
that never goes away.

03:24.006 --> 03:28.642
No, not--
not with you around.

03:28.836 --> 03:30.636
You bring joy to me.

03:31.168 --> 03:34.138
I don't know what I would do
without you.

03:34.159 --> 03:36.192
You are my light.

03:36.933 --> 03:41.479
Should that light extinguish,
I too should fade.

03:43.413 --> 03:45.681
I love you, dad.

03:45.683 --> 03:49.918
I love you too.

03:53.389 --> 03:54.721
Where have you been?

03:54.743 --> 03:57.137
Oh, why don't you cool it
with the mother routine

03:57.171 --> 03:59.056
while I shake up
an eye-opener?

03:59.459 --> 04:01.927
I've been expecting you
for days.

04:02.138 --> 04:04.138
Oh, boo-hoo.

04:04.204 --> 04:05.503
If you want
to know so badly,

04:05.537 --> 04:08.521
I was saving
Morehouse Conglomerate.

04:09.473 --> 04:10.972
How?

04:10.974 --> 04:12.774
Pleasure boating
with the Shah of Iran

04:12.776 --> 04:15.652
and some centerfolds flown over
by <i>Flooze</i> Magazine.

04:16.558 --> 04:19.526
Reza, the Shah?
He's got no pull with OPEC.

04:19.576 --> 04:22.510
- He has no power.
- He will soon.

04:22.576 --> 04:25.207
He'll soon have
all the power he needs.

04:25.568 --> 04:28.503
I asked you to make a deal
with the Arabs,

04:28.601 --> 04:32.080
And instead--
instead you're pleasure boating

04:32.096 --> 04:34.296
around the Mediterranean
with the wrong man

04:34.298 --> 04:36.564
and some floozies
from <i>Snooze</i> Magazine?

04:36.666 --> 04:38.700
So dramatic, mother.

04:39.103 --> 04:41.937
My little boat ride
will save this company.

04:48.278 --> 04:50.912
Mm.
And it was some snoozies

04:50.914 --> 04:54.082
from <i>Flooze</i> Magazine, mother.

04:55.699 --> 04:58.134
- What did you do?
- Now, now.

04:58.168 --> 05:00.201
It's all a big surprise,
isn't it?

05:00.396 --> 05:01.762
Oh, by the by,

05:01.780 --> 05:05.215
have we invited the Shah
to our annual event yet?

05:05.249 --> 05:06.248
Well, yes, of course.

05:06.266 --> 05:08.433
I just sent his invitation
via telegram.

05:08.499 --> 05:10.679
He's not going to show up.
He never has before.

05:10.715 --> 05:12.148
Oh, he'll show, all right.

05:12.198 --> 05:14.801
Mark my words,
he'll be here.

05:15.723 --> 05:17.622
Winston, try to understand.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.054
I couldn't tell you
that your uncle was your father.

05:20.104 --> 05:21.837
Means nothing to me now.

05:22.464 --> 05:24.806
It was wrong,
and I know that now.

05:24.888 --> 05:26.588
You listen to me.

05:27.148 --> 05:28.972
When I am done rescuing
this company,

05:28.990 --> 05:31.390
which you and "my father"--

05:31.456 --> 05:34.957
I mean,
"my father" almost ruined,

05:35.200 --> 05:37.408
I'm kicking you out
on your bony ass.

05:37.484 --> 05:38.650
You're done here.

05:38.737 --> 05:43.249
And as for my father,
I have much bigger plans.

05:43.893 --> 05:46.493
Much, much, much,

05:46.527 --> 05:49.895
much,
much bigger plans.

05:50.218 --> 05:53.119
Hah hah hah hah hah!

05:59.788 --> 06:01.629
Cynthia Morehouse
and I had an agreement.

06:01.668 --> 06:02.928
I would work for the company,

06:02.978 --> 06:04.845
And she would not interfere
with my work.

06:05.425 --> 06:06.590
After her last letter,

06:06.640 --> 06:10.219
I began to muse if she could
hold to the bargain.

06:10.918 --> 06:14.610
I began to muse
if I could hold to the bargain.

06:16.474 --> 06:17.974
And then...

06:18.120 --> 06:21.421
One day,
a lone figure appeared.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.862
Well, hello there, stranger.

06:36.912 --> 06:40.581
Am I such a stranger?

06:40.663 --> 06:43.730
Perhaps not in my heart.

06:43.844 --> 06:47.146
My heart
is home to you as well.

06:47.197 --> 06:50.499
That scent.
<i>Parisien Noir</i> ?

06:50.613 --> 06:52.813
You remembered.

06:52.912 --> 06:55.856
One doesn't forget desire.

06:56.359 --> 06:58.559
Parisian desire.

06:59.043 --> 07:02.812
Come. I have a blanket
and some little snacks

07:02.926 --> 07:06.827
and a jug of day sweet
brand wine over there.

07:06.909 --> 07:09.410
Come.

07:09.653 --> 07:13.121
Are you going to tell me
why you traveled all this way,

07:13.123 --> 07:15.924
or would you like
a little Burgundy red wine

07:15.926 --> 07:18.293
to work up your courage?

07:18.295 --> 07:22.264
Burgundy red wine?
I'd love some.

07:23.508 --> 07:25.509
Devon, I'm scared.

07:25.543 --> 07:28.044
What is it?

07:30.397 --> 07:31.798
It's Winston.

07:32.009 --> 07:34.409
I believe he wants to hurt you
in some way.

07:34.673 --> 07:38.127
More?

07:38.181 --> 07:41.416
Yes, please.

07:42.108 --> 07:45.042
Now...

07:45.156 --> 07:47.623
Tell me about the boy
Winston.

07:47.625 --> 07:50.560
It's complicated.

07:51.012 --> 07:54.914
He's gone mad,
and I'm really afraid.

07:55.943 --> 07:59.391
Do you remember that night
in San Francisco?

07:59.558 --> 08:02.659
- Like it was yesterday.
- Well...

08:03.030 --> 08:06.031
He is your--

08:06.113 --> 08:08.140
You're his--

08:08.778 --> 08:11.212
He's our s--

08:13.959 --> 08:16.327
I'm just afraid
he's gonna hurt you, that's all.

08:16.409 --> 08:18.796
Oh, I'm so touched.

08:18.817 --> 08:21.418
I didn't know
you cared so deeply.

08:21.564 --> 08:24.865
Devon, I've never stopped
loving you.

08:25.028 --> 08:27.696
Is it too late?

08:27.698 --> 08:30.883
- Cynthia.
- Devon.

09:06.381 --> 09:08.481
<i>With Marianne,
and now with you,</i>

09:08.563 --> 09:11.063
<i>I have everything
I've always wanted.</i>

09:11.548 --> 09:13.114
<i>How is she?</i>

09:13.196 --> 09:17.417
<i>She's my angel,
my guiding light.</i>

10:04.795 --> 10:09.364
It's a hard thing, putting you
in the ground, Marianne.

10:09.366 --> 10:12.452
It is I who should be asleep
under all this...

10:12.720 --> 10:15.269
black ground,

10:15.458 --> 10:17.691
Not you.

10:18.017 --> 10:20.051
For it was I
that set in motion

10:20.155 --> 10:22.622
the curse on nature
that damned us all.

10:22.846 --> 10:26.816
To deny the very thing
that breathes life into our--

10:27.179 --> 10:30.503
into our hearts,
is to deny all mankind.

10:31.277 --> 10:34.245
The possibility of love.

10:34.758 --> 10:37.292
My own cowardice
in the face of true love

10:37.294 --> 10:40.059
has brought you
to this ignoble conclusion.

10:40.612 --> 10:43.680
I cannot bear it!

10:43.903 --> 10:46.437
How can your heart be still

10:46.490 --> 10:50.539
while the Earth continues
its rotation?

10:52.255 --> 10:55.256
What cruel force spins us 'round
on this day

10:55.309 --> 10:59.185
when all should stop to join
in your...

11:01.085 --> 11:02.985
stillness?

11:03.584 --> 11:05.584
Cannot the Earth forestall

11:05.620 --> 11:08.154
its diurnal course
but for a while,

11:08.207 --> 11:10.676
so that we can all share
your eternal sleep?

11:11.036 --> 11:14.938
Oh, that I could make it
sooooo!

11:15.520 --> 11:19.922
Like Prometheus,
I would be chained for eternity

11:20.010 --> 11:21.443
to the coldest rock

11:21.530 --> 11:25.490
while eagles tear at my flesh
in exchange

11:25.783 --> 11:29.317
for just one more
breath of air

11:29.592 --> 11:32.485
from your sweet...

11:33.151 --> 11:36.586
innocent lips.

11:36.929 --> 11:38.993
Oh, shoot, Marianne.

11:39.059 --> 11:41.890
I don't know what to say.
I never been much for words.

11:41.892 --> 11:45.055
It just don't seem fair,
you down there and me up here.

11:45.163 --> 11:48.498
It just ain't fair.

11:49.925 --> 11:51.531
I thought
I would find you here.

11:51.966 --> 11:54.033
Cynthia.

11:54.393 --> 11:55.926
Oh!

11:55.996 --> 11:59.431
Oh, you tried to warn me.
You did!

11:59.484 --> 12:01.817
It was Winston, wasn't it?

12:01.870 --> 12:03.724
Please, Devon,
he is but a boy.

12:03.799 --> 12:04.798
A boy.

12:04.988 --> 12:10.018
A boy, a man, a-- a child,
an infant, a fetus, a girl,

12:10.055 --> 12:12.188
an eagle, a vegetable.

12:12.582 --> 12:13.648
What does it matter?

12:13.701 --> 12:16.309
There is a clear difference
between right and wrong!

12:16.501 --> 12:18.535
Am I right, Cynthia?

12:18.929 --> 12:22.564
Oh, it seems we don't have
anything to say to each other.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.051
What about the beach?

12:25.275 --> 12:27.408
Did that mean nothing to you?

12:27.734 --> 12:30.163
It meant everything.

12:32.432 --> 12:35.433
I love you, Cynthia.

12:35.759 --> 12:38.477
I will always love you.

12:40.074 --> 12:42.096
But this will not stand.

12:42.547 --> 12:43.879
No.

12:44.222 --> 12:49.158
This will not staaaand!

12:51.694 --> 12:54.749
Devon, please, come back.

12:55.472 --> 12:56.790
Devon!

12:57.227 --> 12:58.559
Devon.

12:59.413 --> 13:00.884
Devon!

13:01.687 --> 13:03.381
Devon!

13:05.249 --> 13:06.886
Devon!

13:14.950 --> 13:17.018
Devon!

13:30.690 --> 13:32.869
<i>Welcome, everyone.</i>

13:33.042 --> 13:34.842
Oh, I'm so happy
that you're here.

13:35.236 --> 13:39.505
Welcome to the annual
Morehouse Gala for the Arts.

13:39.558 --> 13:42.165
So happy you could
be here tonight.

13:42.456 --> 13:45.724
Enjoy all of the-- the ham.

13:46.596 --> 13:50.485
And, um,
has anyone seen Winston?

13:50.487 --> 13:54.622
Gentlemen, I wish to thank you
for crossing an ocean

13:54.624 --> 13:57.959
and coming to the American
continent to meet with me,

13:57.961 --> 14:00.428
face to face,
in this very room.

14:00.430 --> 14:01.429
My dear boy,

14:01.534 --> 14:03.972
I hope you have brought
the appropriate documents.

14:04.913 --> 14:07.439
It is my humble pleasure
to serve His Majesty,

14:07.595 --> 14:08.560
the Shah of Iran.

14:08.664 --> 14:11.598
Please, we can drop
the formalities.

14:11.839 --> 14:14.794
I've been a friend
of the family for years.

14:15.018 --> 14:16.051
Call me Reza.

14:16.308 --> 14:19.696
Of course. Reza.
I have the documents right here.

14:19.941 --> 14:21.641
All of the documents?

14:21.916 --> 14:23.849
Everything you will need

14:23.987 --> 14:26.642
to construct
your own nuclear bomb.

14:27.382 --> 14:29.950
Can my scientists
look them over?

14:30.225 --> 14:32.925
I trust you will find
everything in order.

14:33.029 --> 14:35.730
When it is determined
that we do indeed

14:35.732 --> 14:37.065
have nuclear capabilities,

14:37.067 --> 14:40.896
I will hand over the code
to a bank account in Geneva.

14:41.223 --> 14:43.824
- Congratulations.
- For what?

14:44.048 --> 14:46.515
Mother, please.
This-- this doesn't concern you.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.185
You seem to be doing a deal

14:48.187 --> 14:49.387
with one
of my old friends, Reza.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.772
How does this
not concern me?

14:50.877 --> 14:53.858
These documents are perfect.

14:53.997 --> 14:55.730
Documents?
What documents?

14:55.800 --> 14:57.728
Mother, leave us!

15:08.606 --> 15:11.135
Winston,
Devon is coming tonight.

15:11.307 --> 15:14.019
Wonderful.
Show your brother a great time.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.887
It's a party, isn't it?

15:16.145 --> 15:17.945
He's coming to kill you.

15:17.998 --> 15:20.499
He thinks you had something
to do with Marianne's death.

15:20.944 --> 15:23.578
Perhaps I did.

15:23.580 --> 15:26.514
That little tart should stay out
of back alleys.

15:26.516 --> 15:29.572
Now please, mother,
the Shah and I have business.

15:29.626 --> 15:30.625
This is true.

15:30.729 --> 15:32.951
Not so fast, hotshot.

15:33.058 --> 15:34.424
Your business is with me.

15:36.650 --> 15:37.983
Hello, Reza.

15:38.036 --> 15:39.669
Mr. Devon Morehouse.

15:40.423 --> 15:43.055
I have not seen you
since Monte Carlo.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.809
Well,
those were luxurious days

15:44.879 --> 15:46.312
and thrilling nights.

15:46.383 --> 15:47.920
We had great fun.

15:48.079 --> 15:52.514
I shall always remember...
Monte... Carrrlo.

15:53.436 --> 15:55.172
As shall I, Your Eminence.

15:55.231 --> 15:57.498
Devon, no, you can't.

15:57.586 --> 15:58.919
The boy must die.

15:58.972 --> 16:00.992
The boy is your son.

16:01.079 --> 16:03.447
What?

16:06.144 --> 16:08.379
- How?
- I meant to tell you.

16:08.790 --> 16:12.171
It was that night
in San Francisco.

16:15.210 --> 16:18.745
The night we made love.

16:19.259 --> 16:21.513
You made love
to your own sister!

16:23.191 --> 16:24.979
But why--
why wouldn't you tell me?

16:25.208 --> 16:29.143
We would have lost everything.
It was in father's will.

16:29.145 --> 16:32.213
My own son...

16:32.215 --> 16:34.148
killed my own daughter.

16:34.150 --> 16:37.225
- What Greek tragedy is this?
- No, no, stop.

16:37.363 --> 16:39.591
Please, let this go.
Leave him.

16:39.630 --> 16:43.012
You and I can run away together
and-- and never look back.

16:44.988 --> 16:47.456
But he killed Marianne.

16:47.901 --> 16:50.087
Too late, daddy.

16:50.502 --> 16:52.034
No!

16:52.121 --> 16:54.055
No!

17:00.891 --> 17:02.158
Cynthia.

17:02.415 --> 17:05.049
You never loved me.

17:09.349 --> 17:11.624
Cynthia!

17:14.020 --> 17:15.628
I love you.

17:15.732 --> 17:17.586
My legacy.

17:18.943 --> 17:21.310
No!

17:24.863 --> 17:27.425
Devon, the--
the blood is leaving me.

17:27.444 --> 17:28.777
No, no, Cynthia, no.

17:28.779 --> 17:30.345
It's not your fault.

17:30.347 --> 17:33.231
Stop.
Don't die on me.

17:34.619 --> 17:37.178
I love you.
I always have.

17:37.283 --> 17:40.191
I've loved you
since the first time I saw you.

17:42.392 --> 17:44.158
I-- I killed Lady Anne.

17:44.449 --> 17:47.041
I burnt her to the ground.
I burned her face.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.414
Shh-shh-shh.
You save your strength.

17:49.893 --> 17:53.355
I also killed Seymore Luntz,
the man with the carburetor

17:53.378 --> 17:56.551
that you and father thought
would change the world.

17:56.735 --> 17:59.639
Speak not of carburetors
and fires.

17:59.709 --> 18:02.243
And... Dixie Melonworth.

18:02.347 --> 18:05.041
I had Winston kill her too.

18:05.418 --> 18:08.743
Love has no morals.

18:08.787 --> 18:11.188
You did what you thought
was best.

18:11.207 --> 18:14.208
Keep-- keep talking.
I want to hear your voice.

18:14.551 --> 18:18.286
I want your voice to be
the last thing I hear before--

18:18.288 --> 18:21.267
Uh... Uh... Uhh....

18:22.384 --> 18:25.084
Cynthia, no.

18:25.802 --> 18:27.335
Why?

18:27.405 --> 18:28.861
Why do men always have to deny

18:28.895 --> 18:30.161
the love that was meant
for them?

18:30.995 --> 18:35.983
I have loved you and lusted
after you my whole life,

18:36.012 --> 18:39.273
and yet
something deep within me

18:39.275 --> 18:41.042
has pulled me away from you.

19:12.783 --> 19:15.618
Run. Run.

19:15.859 --> 19:17.459
Tell your story.

19:17.614 --> 19:20.781
Get it on magnetic audio tape,
so the world will know.

19:20.783 --> 19:23.962
And there you have it,
the whole story.

19:24.697 --> 19:27.031
Tomorrow's papers will read,

19:27.033 --> 19:30.834
"Double murder
at Morehouse mansion."

19:30.990 --> 19:34.192
But it wasn't murder.

19:34.364 --> 19:36.025
It was suicide.

19:37.673 --> 19:42.876
Two souls,
dead at the altar of denial.

19:47.628 --> 19:49.175
That's...

19:50.292 --> 19:51.770
my...

19:53.153 --> 19:54.774
story.

21:35.791 --> 21:39.060
When the wine runs out,
it's time to go.

21:39.624 --> 21:41.324
That's the rule.

21:41.531 --> 21:43.998
That's the rule
as old as the hills.

21:44.051 --> 21:46.238
Is there any more wine?

21:48.464 --> 21:50.757
I need help out of the booth.

21:51.358 --> 21:53.343
Doris?
Is Doris...

21:53.976 --> 21:55.575
Doris, come here.

21:55.747 --> 21:57.680
I just want to say
one thing to you.

21:57.801 --> 22:01.032
I'd like to have you
for my collection,

22:01.119 --> 22:03.836
my menagerie, if you will.

22:04.452 --> 22:06.331
Doris.

22:09.822 --> 22:11.188
Oh, God!

22:11.327 --> 22:13.672
Finger foods,
they always do you in.

22:14.503 --> 22:15.268
Doris.

22:15.424 --> 22:19.326
I won't stop searching
till I find you, Doris.

22:20.129 --> 22:23.593
You can't escape the bear hugs
of Eric Jonrosh.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.347
Where's my siren Doris?

22:30.346 --> 22:32.913
God, I'm definitely
going to be sick.
