00:01.040 --> 00:04.440
In the world today, protecting
a country's borders is vital.

00:06.200 --> 00:08.920
It is seen as a
gateway to the UK.

00:08.960 --> 00:13.200
These are the men and women in
uniform responsible for safeguarding

00:13.240 --> 00:15.640
Ireland's borders. Stopping...

00:15.680 --> 00:17.920
Look at me. Behind the
yellow line. ..Searching...

00:17.960 --> 00:19.576
Have you been stopped
at a checkpoint before?

00:19.600 --> 00:21.496
Will you just listen to me?
Will you just listen to me?

00:21.520 --> 00:25.440
..And seizing drugs,
arms and illegal goods.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.896
If anyone tries to harm me,
that dog will tear them to shreds.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.720
Saving lives...

00:29.760 --> 00:31.840
I'd say about 200km per hour.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.680
..And protecting
Ireland's inhabitants

00:33.720 --> 00:36.040
and millions of
visiting tourists.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.256
You could have been here
100 times, it doesn't mean that

00:38.280 --> 00:40.600
you're guaranteed to
get in the 101st time.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.960
They police the ports...

00:43.000 --> 00:44.640
Well, you have to make sure

00:44.680 --> 00:46.960
there's definitely nobody
underneath the vehicle.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.440
..The airports...

00:48.480 --> 00:50.120
Why did you tell me
you weren't working?

00:50.160 --> 00:51.480
..And the roads.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.200
These are very
badly damaged straps.

00:53.240 --> 00:58.320
If you can't drive the truck,
shouldn't be on the road.

00:58.360 --> 01:00.120
These are the:

01:08.320 --> 01:09.496
Things aren't
adding up for a driver,

01:09.520 --> 01:12.040
and his white Van is
hanging in the balance.

01:12.080 --> 01:14.640
What way do you
pay your insurance?

01:14.680 --> 01:17.720
An American traveller becomes
separated from his family,

01:17.760 --> 01:19.040
and his passport.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.760
Is your wife still in the
plane? Is she coming out, no?

01:21.800 --> 01:24.960
And trucks crossing the borders
are about to have a spanner

01:25.000 --> 01:27.080
thrown in the works.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.560
I'm gonna double-check that now,

01:28.600 --> 01:32.840
but it's coming up as being
expired since August '15.

01:32.880 --> 01:38.000
On patrol around the streets of
Dublin airport, road traffic officers

01:38.040 --> 01:41.880
Mark Faye and paddy mcelroy
are keeping their eyes on the road.

01:41.920 --> 01:44.360
Using on-board anpr technology,

01:44.400 --> 01:48.360
their unmarked car is
automatically reading number plates

01:48.400 --> 01:51.280
and searching for vehicles
that shouldn't be on the road.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.600
And it's not long
before they have a hit.

02:01.640 --> 02:04.880
Officer Faye goes
to find out why.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.520
Right, who owns the Van?

02:08.080 --> 02:10.080
And what's your name?

02:10.120 --> 02:11.736
Do you have your driving
licence on you there, please? Yes.

02:11.760 --> 02:14.040
How long have you owned the Van?

02:16.120 --> 02:18.720
While the driver
talks to officer Faye,

02:18.760 --> 02:21.440
officer mcelroy radios
for a vehicle check

02:21.480 --> 02:25.040
to verify the information the
driver has given is correct.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.800
Roger, stand by.

02:30.840 --> 02:33.416
Have you been stopped at any time
recently with the vehicle, have ya?

02:33.440 --> 02:36.400
I was stopped the
very first week I had it,

02:36.440 --> 02:38.520
and the insurance
was just put out.

02:38.560 --> 02:43.440
The documents hadn't gone
through. That has since been sorted.

02:43.480 --> 02:46.000
Have you been stopped in
the interim basis? No. No.

02:46.040 --> 02:49.240
Ok, I'll just go and double-check
and see what the story is, or see

02:49.280 --> 02:51.736
if there's been any enquiries in
relation to the vehicle, or what.

02:51.760 --> 02:55.440
I'll get back to you in
a minute, then, alright?

02:55.480 --> 03:00.040
The driver explains that he has been
previously stopped for no insurance.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.800
What do you reckon? Just
want to see if there's any worries.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.280
208 to control.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.480
Can you just give me
any information there

03:07.520 --> 03:12.320
in relation to any enquiries
since the purchase date?

03:12.360 --> 03:14.600
And his suspicions
are confirmed.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.080
Roger, thanks.

03:24.640 --> 03:27.720
What way do you
pay your insurance?

03:27.760 --> 03:30.480
On direct debit. And did you
miss any payments with that?

03:30.520 --> 03:33.920
So you're always insured,
or is the money in...

03:33.960 --> 03:36.840
But why don't you do the
three-month period, then,

03:36.880 --> 03:38.640
for the tax? It's 94 euro.

03:43.560 --> 03:47.000
The driver offers up that with
money coming in, he'll soon be

03:47.040 --> 03:51.240
able to pay his road tax. But it's
not good enough for officer Faye.

03:51.280 --> 03:53.440
Driving without
tax is an offence.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.640
The officer is left
with no choice.

03:56.680 --> 03:59.320
I'm actually gonna inform you,
I'm gonna be detaining the vehicle

03:59.360 --> 04:01.416
under the provisions of section
41 of the road traffic act 1961,

04:01.440 --> 04:02.320
as amended.

04:02.360 --> 04:03.976
Basically, the reason
why I'm detaining it

04:04.000 --> 04:07.120
is because you've
had it since October.

04:07.160 --> 04:11.760
And, whilst I sympathise with you
over what you're saying in terms of

04:11.800 --> 04:13.560
your financial difficulty
or whatever else,

04:13.600 --> 04:15.200
the provision is
there in the event

04:15.240 --> 04:17.520
of some people finding
themselves in circumstances.

04:17.560 --> 04:20.160
Joe, can we get a tow
truck to here, please?

04:20.200 --> 04:24.160
I have a section 41 for this
peugeot partner Van, please.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.960
Alright, mind
yourself, ok? See you.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.200
Mind yourself, alright?
Good luck. Bye-bye.

04:29.240 --> 04:34.200
The vehicle is seized, leaving
the man with no white Van.

04:35.800 --> 04:40.280
Avoiding payment has only added
to that driver's financial problems.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.520
And unfortunately now
for him, it's gonna cost him

04:42.560 --> 04:45.840
the fees in which the reclaim is,
and also he'll have the back taxes

04:45.880 --> 04:48.640
and tax for the unpaid period.

04:48.680 --> 04:52.600
Why you would purchase a vehicle
and not take into account as to

04:52.640 --> 04:55.720
the actual out of costs that are
involved in relation to putting it

04:55.760 --> 04:59.160
on the road. He should've factored
into consideration the yearly tax

04:59.200 --> 05:00.680
or, as I said to him,

05:00.720 --> 05:04.480
a three-monthly tax period if
he found himself in difficulty.

05:07.240 --> 05:11.320
Being the most westerly of all
European airports, Shannon has

05:11.360 --> 05:16.480
become a major destination for
connecting transatlantic flights.

05:16.520 --> 05:20.320
With over 1.7 million passengers
a year using the airport,

05:20.360 --> 05:24.360
it's vital that border control
are able to monitor everyone

05:24.400 --> 05:26.160
coming and going
through its channels.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.600
Transferring on a
connecting international flight,

05:29.640 --> 05:33.520
passengers are kept airside and
do not officially enter the country.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.280
Enjoy your stay, then.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.120
Have a great time.
Take care now.

05:37.160 --> 05:41.400
This passenger has arrived
at officer dara Malloy's desk.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.080
What's that, sir?

05:46.240 --> 05:47.720
And where is your wife?

05:54.720 --> 05:58.200
Is your wife still in plane?
Is she coming out, no?

05:59.760 --> 06:02.520
And has she gone
through immigration here?

06:07.600 --> 06:09.560
Oh, you have two
children as well, is it?

06:13.480 --> 06:16.480
Yeah. Oh, you're fine, you're
fine. Yeah, there's no problem there.

06:16.520 --> 06:19.040
But she must've gone through
immigration if she's not here

06:19.080 --> 06:21.200
in the immigration hall.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.320
Ok.

06:25.360 --> 06:26.896
Look, I think we have
someone trying to page your wife,

06:26.920 --> 06:29.160
just to try and get her.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.376
So if you just take a seat
over there for two minutes, sir,

06:31.400 --> 06:33.640
I'm gonna try and get her, ok?

06:33.680 --> 06:37.520
Having found himself at
Irish immigration with no ID,

06:37.560 --> 06:40.400
a missing family,
and a flight to catch,

06:40.440 --> 06:44.040
the immigration officers are faced
with trying to solve the situation.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.576
If it's a connecting
flight, obviously,

06:45.600 --> 06:48.520
if they're not Irish national, it
makes it a bit more complicated.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.280
The main thing
is that, you know,

06:50.320 --> 06:52.696
people don't panic, come to us
and we can always help you out.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.536
We can always help you
out and facilitate by ringing

06:54.560 --> 06:57.240
the embassy or ringing some
person who may have the passport,

06:57.280 --> 06:59.000
or we'll be able to
contact someone

06:59.040 --> 07:00.176
who'll be able to get
the passport for them.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.960
Between getting off the plane
and just getting over here,

07:03.000 --> 07:06.040
there are so many steps,

07:06.080 --> 07:08.520
and there are
very few directions.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.040
And so, just...

07:11.880 --> 07:15.480
You know, she went ahead
and took the children ahead,

07:15.520 --> 07:19.040
but we didn't really think it
would be this complicated.

07:19.080 --> 07:22.880
We just figured it would be one way
and then we would all meet up ahead.

07:22.920 --> 07:26.160
But apparently, it's not.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.216
They can't give him leave
to land without a passport,

07:28.240 --> 07:32.680
and he can't get back through
to the transfer route without going

07:32.720 --> 07:35.440
ahead through immigration first.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.000
They need to make sure
he is who he says he is,

07:38.040 --> 07:42.680
and the quickest way to do that is
to locate his wife and his passport.

07:42.720 --> 07:46.200
An announcement is
put out around the airport.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.241
Hopefully, we'll get it all figured
out and we'll get on our flight.

07:51.280 --> 07:55.480
And all he can do is wait.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.640
I think it leaves at 12:45,
so we have another hour,

07:58.680 --> 08:00.280
so we should be ok.

08:00.320 --> 08:02.640
We have the right
people working on it,

08:02.680 --> 08:05.680
I think. If everyone else gets
on the flight except for me,

08:05.720 --> 08:09.160
as long as I get my passport
or something, it'll all be ok.

08:09.200 --> 08:13.280
The airport team have found
his passport and, with official ID,

08:13.320 --> 08:15.200
the process can now begin.

08:15.240 --> 08:18.200
He's transferring on to
Boston with his family, but

08:18.240 --> 08:21.240
his family took the transfer route,
and he took the route down through

08:21.280 --> 08:24.640
Irish immigration. His wife had
his passport, so now we've retrieved

08:24.680 --> 08:26.920
his passport, and we're
gonna get him back upstairs.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.840
He's now in a race to
reach his flight in time.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.600
Oh, we got it? Ok. Yep, ok.

08:31.640 --> 08:35.960
So I'll get you to go through.
Your wife and the kids are upstairs.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Ok, there was a transfer line
but they went down that line, ok?

08:39.040 --> 08:41.440
I'll bring you to dara and
then he'll bring you through.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.400
Well, I'm glad I found you.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.360
Oh. Thank you. There you go.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.200
I'll bring you back
up through security

08:47.240 --> 08:48.496
and then we'll get
through the fast check-in.

08:48.520 --> 08:51.000
You found your wife? Yes.

08:51.040 --> 08:55.960
Very good. Are you going back
to the states now today? Yes.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.600
Very good, sir. Take care,
sir, and safe home. Thank you.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.960
Take care, sir. Bye, now.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.040
Once through immigration,

09:03.080 --> 09:06.160
the passenger is escorted
through the airport and security

09:06.200 --> 09:10.240
to be reunited with his family in
time to catch their ongoing flight.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.280
Traffic cops Mark Faye and paddy
mcelroy are patrolling the roads

09:17.320 --> 09:22.120
that link Dublin to its port,
airport, and the rest of the country.

09:23.440 --> 09:28.600
They've already stopped and seized
one vehicle for driving with no tax.

09:28.640 --> 09:33.800
In 2015, the garda prosecuted
over 7,000 people for driving

09:33.840 --> 09:38.200
without insurance. And ever since,
they've been cracking down further

09:38.240 --> 09:41.160
on this offence.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.840
It's not long before
the anpr system flags

09:43.880 --> 09:47.200
yet another suspicious vehicle.

09:47.240 --> 09:50.160
Officer mcelroy
speaks to the driver.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.416
Right, that's the reason you're
being stopped. You've no nct,

09:52.440 --> 09:55.400
you've no tax on
the vehicle either.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.200
Ok? Any reason for it?

09:57.240 --> 09:59.520
I've got no excuse -
a good one, I don't.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.440
Do you always not
wear your seatbelt?

10:02.480 --> 10:04.800
I just took it off now.
You just took it off, ok.

10:04.840 --> 10:07.080
You know you're in danger
of your vehicle being seized,

10:07.120 --> 10:08.776
do you understand
that? Yeah, I understand.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.376
Yeah, more than
likely, it probably will be.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.080
I'm just gonna do a
few checks on it, ok?

10:14.160 --> 10:20.040
Did anything else come up
with that? She has no excuse.

10:20.080 --> 10:24.400
Officer Faye checks her
details against their system.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.880
Control, do you mind
contacting someone there, please,

10:26.920 --> 10:33.040
for a section 41? We're on the n81
outbound there before the circle k.

10:33.080 --> 10:38.280
In 2016, an aa survey found that
the cost of car insurance in Ireland

10:38.320 --> 10:42.160
had increased by almost
40% in under two years.

10:42.200 --> 10:45.600
So, her nct's out since
the end of last year.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.240
Tax is out since
the start of the year.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.320
She had no reason for it.

10:51.360 --> 10:54.360
She just didn't bother doing it.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.040
Unfortunately for this
driver, the news isn't good.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.960
No. Grand, thanks.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.720
Unfortunately, it's
bad news for you.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.600
Yeah, the vehicle's
gonna be seized under

11:07.640 --> 11:09.720
section 41 of the
road traffic act,

11:09.760 --> 11:13.280
of which you'll need to go
and get things sorted out.

11:13.320 --> 11:14.880
There's no tax or
no insurance on it.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.696
You didn't give me a plausible
reason why you didn't...

11:16.720 --> 11:19.280
No insurance. What,
you mean tax and nct?

11:19.320 --> 11:21.696
You didn't give me a plausible
reason why you didn't have it done.

11:21.720 --> 11:24.680
You're driving a vehicle in
a public place and it's just...

11:24.720 --> 11:26.896
You know, unfortunately, we
meet under these circumstances,

11:26.920 --> 11:28.376
but that's the reason
we're there for.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.320
The female driver
is clearly upset

11:31.360 --> 11:34.320
as the consequences of
having no insurance hit home.

11:36.240 --> 11:40.800
She had no excuse. So, in relation
to the no nct, that carries three

11:40.840 --> 11:42.360
penalty points and a fine.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.560
A conviction in court
is five penalty points.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.840
There'll be also a ticket
issued for the no tax.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.920
In just one patrol, two
vehicles have been seized,

11:51.960 --> 11:55.800
making the roads of Ireland
safer for all who use them.

11:58.960 --> 12:02.280
At Dublin airport, working on
the non-eu passenger desk,

12:02.320 --> 12:06.560
garda frank Flynn is checking
passports and travel documents.

12:06.600 --> 12:11.800
Just checking the
flights now from 12:20.

12:11.840 --> 12:14.120
With Ireland's high
standard of living,

12:14.160 --> 12:17.000
strong economy and
membership of the European Union,

12:17.040 --> 12:19.320
it's an inviting
immigration destination.

12:19.360 --> 12:22.800
You going driving? We
are. On the left. Yes, I know.

12:22.840 --> 12:26.880
Nearly 30 million passengers
use Dublin airport every year,

12:26.920 --> 12:30.720
and it's the responsibility of
border officers like officer Flynn

12:30.760 --> 12:32.536
to protect this important
entry point to Ireland.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.480
Ok.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.800
90 days, sir. Thank
you. Take care.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.600
It demands vigilance, alertness
and an attention to detail.

12:39.640 --> 12:43.520
Hi, there. Hello.
Morning. How are you?

12:43.560 --> 12:45.440
Good. How are you, sir? Good.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.640
A family who have
just landed from the us

12:47.680 --> 12:49.320
arrive at officer Flynn's booth.

12:49.360 --> 12:52.720
You're on your
summer break? Yes, sir.

12:52.760 --> 12:57.920
How long are you staying,
ma'am? 16 days in total.

12:57.960 --> 13:01.840
Lovely. Thank you, sir.

13:01.880 --> 13:05.800
Happy with their documents, officer
Flynn allows the family into Ireland,

13:05.840 --> 13:09.000
but not before he makes
an eagle-eye observation.

13:09.040 --> 13:13.760
Police officer, Christopher?
Yes. So am I. Best of luck.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.720
He realised I was a police
officer, I guess by my wristband.

13:20.760 --> 13:24.280
We have like a brotherhood,
I guess, so for him to notice

13:24.320 --> 13:28.000
my wristband that quick,
he was very observant.

13:28.040 --> 13:31.320
I work at the courthouse in the
states and I work warrant unit.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.936
And I pick up on details, but I
don't know if I'd have picked that

13:33.960 --> 13:36.800
up that quick. Sitting where he
was sitting at, that was pretty slick.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.136
For officer Flynn, it's just a
chance to bond with fellow

13:40.160 --> 13:43.560
international police officers.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.320
There's a bond there worldwide,
you know, with the police forces,

13:46.360 --> 13:48.280
and especially usa.

13:48.320 --> 13:52.160
And the garda go to the us
every st Patrick's day in march

13:52.200 --> 13:54.760
in the st Patrick's day
parade, you know?

13:58.000 --> 14:01.200
Hello. How are you? Fine,
thank you. Good. Good.

14:02.640 --> 14:06.880
Next to approach officer Flynn's
desk is a woman travelling alone.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.200
Although the lady has
arrived from France,

14:10.240 --> 14:13.800
she's at officer Flynn's booth
because she's not an eu citizen.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.160
She's African.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.840
The lady was from Guinea-Bissau.

14:16.880 --> 14:21.840
She had a visa to enter, a
multi-entry visa into Ireland.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.920
You live in France? Yes.

14:23.960 --> 14:27.440
The woman may live in France,
but her west African nationality

14:27.480 --> 14:29.760
means she has a
different immigration status

14:29.800 --> 14:32.920
to a citizen of an eu country.

14:32.960 --> 14:36.920
She needs specific documentation
if she intends to stay and work.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.960
You have a letter,
have you? Yeah.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.960
The woman produces a letter

14:42.000 --> 14:46.080
to show she is part of something
called the atypical work scheme.

14:46.120 --> 14:49.040
It allows non-citizens
to work in Ireland

14:49.080 --> 14:53.080
for a specific employer, whether
as a skill shortage in the profession,

14:53.120 --> 14:54.840
or they have specialised skills.

14:54.880 --> 14:58.680
She has an atypical work
scheme letter from lidl,

14:58.720 --> 15:02.240
so she's entitled to
work with them for up to -

15:02.280 --> 15:06.360
normally it's three months,
but she said it would last a year.

15:06.400 --> 15:10.520
She's non-European so she has
to go on the system and register.

15:10.560 --> 15:14.560
With 143 stores currently
in the republic of Ireland,

15:14.600 --> 15:17.680
lidl is one of Ireland's
top employers.

15:17.720 --> 15:21.040
But, as an international company,
it also employs specialist staff

15:21.080 --> 15:23.000
of other nationalities.

15:23.040 --> 15:26.600
With her paperwork in order, officer
Flynn processes the woman's entry.

15:26.640 --> 15:29.720
Lidl are based in
kildare, aren't they? Yes.

15:29.760 --> 15:32.200
So where are you gonna
live, in kildare, is it, or Dublin?

15:36.240 --> 15:37.320
Yeah.

15:38.440 --> 15:42.000
Well, you're gonna have to register
with immigration, you know that?

15:44.800 --> 15:47.760
Alright. If you're living in Dublin,
you've gotta go to this office

15:47.800 --> 15:52.760
and register with immigration
within 90 days, ok? Ok.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.760
And they will give you a stamp
then, for your remaining time.

15:56.840 --> 15:59.640
It's critical she registers with
the immigration department

15:59.680 --> 16:02.720
and that she gives herself
enough time to do so.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.880
Ok, if you get a chance, yeah.

16:08.920 --> 16:12.240
But sometimes it's busy
in there, you know? Ok.

16:12.280 --> 16:15.160
If she fails and misses the
deadline, there's a very good chance

16:15.200 --> 16:18.240
that she'll not be allowed to
stay beyond the initial 90 days,

16:18.280 --> 16:20.960
even with the prospect of a job.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.800
Thank you so much. See you,
then. Bye. Take care. Bye-bye.

16:31.640 --> 16:35.160
In county donegal, vehicle
inspector des Hughes is carrying out

16:35.200 --> 16:40.600
safety inspections on trucks at
a checkpoint set up by the police.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.600
On the border with
northern Ireland,

16:42.640 --> 16:46.000
county donegal is a vital
entry and exit point for haulage.

16:46.040 --> 16:49.320
Where we are today is
pretty close to the border,

16:49.360 --> 16:52.280
so we'll get lots of
cross-water traffic.

16:52.880 --> 16:57.840
Some vehicles from
northern Ireland, registered,

16:57.880 --> 17:00.160
and southern registered.

17:01.280 --> 17:04.760
It's not long before they pull
over the first truck of the day.

17:07.320 --> 17:08.240
How are you doing?

17:08.280 --> 17:11.960
Vehicle inspector Hughes
immediately begins his inspection,

17:12.000 --> 17:15.280
checking every aspect
of the truck and its trailer.

17:15.320 --> 17:18.320
They're all reading
about 60-70 degrees,

17:18.360 --> 17:21.920
which tells me these
brakes are working.

17:21.960 --> 17:25.040
Both the truck and its trailer
are in good working order.

17:25.080 --> 17:27.400
But when he checks
the safety certification

17:27.440 --> 17:29.600
for the vehicle's
trailer, there's an issue.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.480
I'm gonna double-check that now,

17:32.520 --> 17:36.480
but it's coming up as being
expired since August '15.

17:36.520 --> 17:39.640
August? Nah, that's not
right. There's something wrong.

17:39.680 --> 17:42.320
Trailers, like every other
vehicle on Ireland's roads,

17:42.360 --> 17:45.040
have to have a valid
certificate of road worthiness,

17:45.080 --> 17:47.720
and this one doesn't
appear to have one.

17:47.760 --> 17:50.840
Vehicle inspector
Hughes fills in paperwork.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.400
The driver's phoned his boss.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.600
He claims the
trailer is certificated,

17:55.640 --> 17:57.600
but in northern Ireland.

17:57.640 --> 18:01.440
The ni number on this trailer,
it's tested in the north. Ok.

18:03.280 --> 18:07.080
Ok, he's just informed me
that there's an ni number on it,

18:07.120 --> 18:08.960
which is a northern
trailer number,

18:09.000 --> 18:11.560
which has been tested in
the north instead of the south.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.240
Unfortunately for
vehicle inspector Hughes,

18:14.280 --> 18:17.800
he can't confirm that
the test happened.

18:17.840 --> 18:23.920
I can check a vehicle as in a truck
from the north on my phone for mot,

18:23.960 --> 18:29.120
which is their test, and road
tax, but I can't check a trailer.

18:29.160 --> 18:32.800
Instead, he'll need to rely on
the owner sending him evidence

18:32.840 --> 18:34.640
the trailer is certified.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.240
Will you just get him to
email it on to me anyway?

18:37.280 --> 18:39.656
I'll have it on the form, right?
Just a copy of the test, yeah?

18:39.680 --> 18:42.360
Having done a thorough check
of the vehicle, he knows it's in

18:42.400 --> 18:48.320
good working order, so he's happy
to let the truck carry on its journey.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.160
It's not long before
they pull in another truck,

18:51.200 --> 18:53.240
and he's faced with
a similar problem.

18:53.280 --> 18:56.040
Is the truck tested?

18:56.080 --> 19:00.120
It is. I'm certain it is. It
was tested in the north.

19:00.160 --> 19:01.336
Have you any
paperwork there, no?

19:01.360 --> 19:03.400
I don't have any
paperwork for this truck.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.016
Can I step in the far
side for a second?

19:05.040 --> 19:07.040
Yeah, of course, as
long the feet's clean.

19:10.640 --> 19:13.080
Vehicle inspector Hughes
carries out a full inspection

19:13.120 --> 19:14.880
of the truck and trailer.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.480
We're within a few miles of
the border here so, you know,

19:17.520 --> 19:21.680
people are travelling each side
of the border in their daily work.

19:21.720 --> 19:24.600
Some businesses have
addresses both sides of the border.

19:24.640 --> 19:28.080
It makes it more difficult
to get the full story on them

19:28.120 --> 19:30.920
and get the full picture of what's
not tested and what is tested,

19:30.960 --> 19:32.456
and tested in the south,
been tested in the north.

19:32.480 --> 19:36.000
So it's a full-time job.

19:36.040 --> 19:39.920
Happy that they're both
roadworthy, he allows the truck to go,

19:39.960 --> 19:42.800
but he'll need to be sent
the required paperwork.

19:42.840 --> 19:46.400
And then, it's on to the
next truck and trailer.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.640
Dublin port has
become a regular stop

19:55.680 --> 19:57.600
for cruise ships from
around the world.

19:57.640 --> 20:03.120
At 330m long, the 'royal Princess'
is one of the largest ships ever to

20:03.160 --> 20:05.600
have berthed in Dublin.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.760
The ship is carrying
over 3,000 passengers,

20:07.800 --> 20:12.880
all of which will need to be
safely managed on and off the site,

20:12.920 --> 20:16.760
and it's good logistics that are
going to get the job done safely.

20:19.600 --> 20:23.000
Under the watchful eye
of port security officers,

20:23.040 --> 20:25.600
security swing into action.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.480
As you can see, it's mental.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.560
They can't get distracted.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.320
Security need to remain
vigilant, checking vehicles,

20:32.360 --> 20:34.200
and managing crowd control...

20:34.240 --> 20:39.480
It's a lot of checking going on,
and a lot of bodies around the port,

20:39.520 --> 20:40.840
a lot of securities coming in.

20:40.880 --> 20:45.120
..As it's when things appear chaotic
that people intent on causing harm

20:45.160 --> 20:48.840
or performing illegal activity can
take advantage of the situation.

20:50.600 --> 20:54.680
Security need to make sure that
every single passenger arriving

20:54.720 --> 20:59.840
is properly screened and checked
before being allowed on-board.

20:59.880 --> 21:02.160
This is organised
chaos, that's what it is.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.840
If there's panic,
let it be organised.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.720
What are you doing?

21:05.760 --> 21:07.960
You can't come back
here, you're holding it all up.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.120
Just turn around to the right.
You can't come out that way, sir.

21:11.160 --> 21:14.400
Follow the bus. Move
it up. Don't park there.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.360
You get a lull and then
just another wave comes in

21:20.400 --> 21:21.520
and they're everywhere.

21:21.560 --> 21:23.120
It's all gone smoothly.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.560
With the port security
being so organised,

21:25.600 --> 21:28.080
any potential risk
has been prevented.

21:29.560 --> 21:32.080
Everyone is back
on-board who should be.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.960
The 'Princess
royal' can set sail.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
