Wait, I...

00:16.625 --> 00:18.235
I know that voice.

00:18.279 --> 00:20.281
It'd-it'd be a lot easier
if you took this bag

00:20.324 --> 00:23.458
off my head. I mean...

00:23.501 --> 00:25.460
Viktor. [chuckles]

00:25.503 --> 00:27.418
I knew it was you.
I bet you feel

00:27.462 --> 00:29.812
really proud of yourself
right now, right? I mean,

00:29.855 --> 00:32.119
you tracked me down.
You captured me.

00:32.162 --> 00:34.077
But did you ever stop to think
that maybe...

00:34.121 --> 00:36.079
maybe I let you capture me

00:36.123 --> 00:37.950
because I've been looking
for you?

00:37.994 --> 00:40.083
Yes, I did.

00:40.127 --> 00:41.432
[footsteps approach]

00:45.523 --> 00:47.264
[chuckles]

00:47.308 --> 00:50.267
I knew your friends
were posing as mercenaries

00:50.311 --> 00:53.270
from the moment I hired them
to kidnap you.

00:53.314 --> 00:55.707
On that note,

00:55.751 --> 00:58.275
did you guys really have
to be that rough?

00:58.319 --> 01:00.408
We had to make it look
like a real kidnapping.VIKTOR: Hey, hey.

01:00.451 --> 01:03.150
That's enough.You guys threw me in that trunk,
like, really hard.

01:03.193 --> 01:04.368
Yeah, but we were in character.

01:04.412 --> 01:05.326
You-you got to get
in a kidnapper's head,

01:05.369 --> 01:06.805

a kidnapper do?

01:06.849 --> 01:08.024
And you got to do that.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.026
I think you guys
oversold it, you know?

01:10.070 --> 01:12.463
You could've given me
a power bar, a banana.

01:12.507 --> 01:14.378
I was in that trunk for an hour.20 minutes.

01:14.422 --> 01:15.858
What are you talking about?
20 minutes? That's insane.VIKTOR: I said

01:15.901 --> 01:17.077
that's enough!You are such a baby.

01:18.208 --> 01:20.819

Oh, please.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.585
Four precision shots
in under a second?

01:47.629 --> 01:49.370

I'm sorry, but that's...

01:49.413 --> 01:51.676
absolute rubbish.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.201
Sure, if the firearm

01:54.244 --> 01:55.506
was an automatic, then yes,

01:55.550 --> 01:57.465
maybe four shots
wouldn't be out of the question.

01:57.508 --> 01:59.467
But the White Knight
was using a semiautomatic,

01:59.510 --> 02:01.295
which, as any good marksperson
will tell you, is just...

02:01.338 --> 02:02.774
It's just not, um...[Kumu clears throat]

Perhaps Ms. Higgins

02:13.916 --> 02:16.266
could share something
about Mr. Masters

02:16.310 --> 02:17.528
and this lovely estate?

02:17.572 --> 02:21.358
[quietly]: Yeah.Certainly. Uh, let's see.

02:21.402 --> 02:23.708
Well, after his time
as a war journalist,

02:23.752 --> 02:26.146
Robin Masters stayed here on
the grounds in the guesthouse,

02:26.189 --> 02:28.409
which is where he wrote
his first White Knight novel,

02:28.452 --> 02:31.194
White Knight: Queen's Gambit.

02:31.238 --> 02:32.674
And he loved
being here so much

02:32.717 --> 02:34.197
that once
the White Knight franchise

02:34.241 --> 02:36.199
became a runaway global success,

02:36.243 --> 02:38.767
he decided to purchase
the entire property

02:38.810 --> 02:40.551
and christened it Robin's Nest.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.205
Who lives in the guesthouse now?

02:44.251 --> 02:46.775
No one of any significance.

02:46.818 --> 02:48.603
Well, I think we would all love
to see where Mr. Masters

02:48.646 --> 02:50.344
created the White Knight.

02:50.387 --> 02:52.476
Would it be possible
to tour the guesthouse?BOY: That would be

02:52.520 --> 02:55.349

She was smart.

Fearless.

She was all heart.

08:58.015 --> 09:01.149
How long were you guys together?On and off

09:01.192 --> 09:04.326
for a few years until I...

09:04.369 --> 09:06.328
I ended it.

09:06.371 --> 09:09.723
At the time I wasn't certain
if she was the one.

09:09.766 --> 09:11.986
But I can't say I regret
breaking up with her,

09:12.029 --> 09:15.729
because soon after,
met my late wife, Vera.

09:15.772 --> 09:17.600
Yeah.

09:17.644 --> 09:20.081
But I often wonder...

09:20.124 --> 09:22.431
what if we had stayed together?

09:23.693 --> 09:26.217
I-I'd like for you
to find Elizabeth,

09:26.261 --> 09:27.567
if at all possible.

09:27.610 --> 09:30.221
I can certainly try.

09:30.265 --> 09:32.354
Do you have anything else
I can go off of?

09:32.397 --> 09:33.834
Uh...

09:33.877 --> 09:37.446
I recently received this e-mail
from her.

09:37.489 --> 09:41.232
Well, why not just reply

09:41.276 --> 09:42.494
and ask her to meet you?

09:42.538 --> 09:44.496
Because I can't be certain
it's her.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.150
And why's that?

09:46.194 --> 09:49.676
Because Elizabeth Cole
has been dead for 30 years.

09:56.900 --> 09:59.163
Elizabeth vanished in 1987,

09:59.207 --> 10:01.035
never to resurface,

10:01.078 --> 10:03.646
and sadly was declared dead.

to believe it's her,

10:21.795 --> 10:24.928
but my attorney wanted me
to hire a private investigator.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.800
He thinks it may be a scam.

10:26.843 --> 10:29.890
I'm sorry to say,
but I think he might be right.

10:29.933 --> 10:32.675
I feel like this
could be a play for money.

10:32.719 --> 10:35.722
Or Elizabeth
could still be alive.

10:35.765 --> 10:38.333
I would be so thrilled
to see her again.

10:38.376 --> 10:41.728
And I'd happily give her
whatever money she needs.

10:42.772 --> 10:44.948
Look, would you do me a favor?

10:44.992 --> 10:48.169
Just don't respond to that
e-mail until we know more.

10:48.212 --> 10:50.040
Promise you, I'm
gonna look into this.

10:50.084 --> 10:52.347
Thank you.
Thank you.

10:59.571 --> 11:01.530
TC:
So, how's it been

11:01.573 --> 11:02.705
since you got home?

11:02.749 --> 11:03.967
Couldn't be better.

11:04.011 --> 11:06.666
I won the lotto and
married a supermodel.

11:06.709 --> 11:07.928
You?

11:07.971 --> 11:09.669
[laughs]Same. Same.

11:09.712 --> 11:10.800
[chuckles]

11:10.844 --> 11:13.324
Yeah, what was your
M.O.S. in Iraq?

11:13.368 --> 11:14.761
What is this,
20 questions?

11:14.804 --> 11:17.589
No, no, man. I-I...
Just, I was a door gunner.

11:17.633 --> 11:20.984
TC was a chopper pilot.Yeah? Venoms?

11:21.028 --> 11:22.682
Super Hueys.

11:22.725 --> 11:24.118
UH-1 Yankees.

11:24.161 --> 11:25.423
Nice.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.730
I always wanted
to be a mechanic.

11:27.774 --> 11:30.167
But they didn't have any
slots when I enlisted,

11:30.211 --> 11:31.778
so I became a driver.

11:31.821 --> 11:34.737
I deployed with a medium
truck platoon from the 153rd.

11:34.781 --> 11:37.305
Yeah, we drove
on Route Irish.

11:37.348 --> 11:39.133
It's a rough road.

11:39.176 --> 11:42.745
But I could clock IEDs
from a hundred meters out.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.791
Everybody wanted
to ride with me.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.793
I kept all my boys safe.

11:46.836 --> 11:49.143
It was good
having a job,

11:49.186 --> 11:51.058
an identity.

11:51.101 --> 11:53.321
The ability to walk.

11:53.364 --> 11:55.845
You have family
here on the island?

11:55.889 --> 11:57.455
Ex-wife.

11:57.499 --> 11:59.370
She left me, after ten years.

11:59.414 --> 12:01.633
But I don't blame her.

12:05.289 --> 12:07.770
So what do you guys do now?

12:07.814 --> 12:09.816
I have a helicopter
tour business.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.687
Rick runs a beach club.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.777
I guess some of us transition
better than others.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.431
It wasn't all roses.

12:16.474 --> 12:17.954
We had some help.

12:17.998 --> 12:20.130
You ever hear
of Robin Masters?

12:20.174 --> 12:22.350
That hotshot
writer guy?

12:22.393 --> 12:23.786
He's a friend.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.353
He helped TC get his chopper,

12:25.396 --> 12:28.182
and he got me the job running
the King Kamehameha Club.

12:28.225 --> 12:29.879
TC:
He knew we needed
to keep busy.

12:29.923 --> 12:33.143
Have a sense of purpose,
you know what I mean?

12:34.144 --> 12:36.799
Yeah.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.888
Yeah, so hey, what are you doing
the rest of the day?

12:38.932 --> 12:40.716
You're looking at it.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.762
Well, uh, we were
about to do some surfing

12:42.805 --> 12:44.589
up at Maili Point.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.287
You want to tag along?

12:46.330 --> 12:48.202
Yeah, and after that,
we can all hike

12:48.245 --> 12:50.073
up to the top
of Diamond Head.

12:50.117 --> 12:52.728
[chuckles]Maybe you guys
didn't notice,

12:52.772 --> 12:55.644
but my legs--
they don't work so well.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.646
Actually,
there's a big community

12:57.689 --> 12:59.779
of disabled vets that surf.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.824
A lot
of those guys--

13:01.868 --> 13:04.305
they find peace
out in the ocean.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.744
Why climb the mountain?

13:08.788 --> 13:10.746
Hello? Because it's there.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.182
Behold!

13:12.226 --> 13:15.838
I have conquered Ka'au Crater![door opens, closes]

13:15.882 --> 13:19.886
Tell me our head of security
didn't just steal my laptop.

13:19.929 --> 13:21.104
I'm in no mood for irony.

13:21.148 --> 13:22.540
I'm on a case, Higgins.

13:22.584 --> 13:25.413
Plus, you told me
to borrow it.I did no such thing.

13:25.456 --> 13:28.590
Sure you did. You said, "Don't
use the house computer anymore."

13:28.633 --> 13:30.766
So your takeaway from that
was to steal my laptop?

13:30.810 --> 13:31.854
Borrow. And yes.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.160
Higgins, this isAh...

13:33.203 --> 13:34.770
for a big case, all right?

13:34.814 --> 13:36.554
My only lead is an e-mail,

13:36.598 --> 13:38.905
and I'm having trouble
tracing down the IP address.

13:38.948 --> 13:41.864
Look, if you help me,
I will buy my own computer

13:41.908 --> 13:43.910
and never use yours again.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.870
[clears throat]

13:47.914 --> 13:49.654
Who's the girl?

13:49.698 --> 13:51.526
Elizabeth Cole.
She's the former girlfriend

13:51.569 --> 13:53.528
of Henry Barr.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.312
He's a sugar tycoon.

13:55.356 --> 13:57.924
Says here she
disappeared in 1987.Yeah.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.143
Yet this e-mail is from her.

14:00.187 --> 14:01.579
Someone who claims to be her.

14:01.623 --> 14:03.755
You ask me,
it's a play for money.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.888
So whoever sent this e-mail
is merely trying to scam

14:05.932 --> 14:07.803
a rich man at the
end of his life.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.326
That's repugnant.

14:09.370 --> 14:11.328
Yeah. Yeah, it's worse,
considering Barr's

14:11.372 --> 14:13.374
in the early stages
of dementia.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.682
So, um...

14:17.726 --> 14:21.208
I assume the police investigated
Ms. Cole's disappearance?

14:21.251 --> 14:23.340
Yeah, but the only real lead
was that she racked up

14:23.384 --> 14:24.820
a bunch of debt
before she went missing.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.561
You think there's any
chance she's still alive?

14:26.604 --> 14:28.432
No, I doubt it.
They found her car abandoned

14:28.476 --> 14:29.694
ten miles from her house.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.696
Hmm.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.350
I got something.

14:33.394 --> 14:35.918
It looks like the e-mail was
sent from a public computer

14:35.962 --> 14:37.441
at the Hawaii State Library.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.704
What branch?King Street.

14:39.748 --> 14:42.055
Incidentally, Mr. Masters is
a generous benefactor there.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.970
They even named
a wing after him.

14:44.013 --> 14:45.275
Really?Mm-hmm.

14:47.930 --> 14:50.193
I might have
one more favor to ask.

14:52.761 --> 14:53.893
[typing]

14:53.936 --> 14:55.285
Thank you again.

14:55.329 --> 14:57.592
I realize this is, um,
highly unusual.

14:57.635 --> 14:59.986
Oh. Anything
for Robin Masters.

15:00.029 --> 15:02.989
And not just because he's
our most generous benefactor.

15:03.032 --> 15:05.817
I'm actually
a huge White Knight fan.

15:06.862 --> 15:07.863
I... Me too.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.734
I love the White Knight.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.998
Uh, what a hero.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.303
Right?Have you read

15:13.347 --> 15:14.870
the latest one,
White Knight's Secret State?

15:14.914 --> 15:17.351
Uh, uh, no spoilers.
I haven't finished it yet.

15:19.614 --> 15:20.963
Okay.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.182
I'll leave you to it.

15:22.225 --> 15:23.879
Take all the time that you need.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.925
Thank you.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.622
Right.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.493
So, the e-mail was sent at 3:31,

15:29.537 --> 15:32.409
which means the mystery e-mailer
should be appearing any second.

15:36.761 --> 15:39.242
There. Red hair.
Same height.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.464
For a dead woman...

15:43.507 --> 15:45.596
Elizabeth Cole
looks bloody good.

15:53.256 --> 15:54.605
I can't believe it.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.999
The hair.
The sweatshirt.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.001
That's her alma mater.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.090
It could be her.

16:01.134 --> 16:02.918
Could also be someone else.

16:02.962 --> 16:06.052
I'd caution against being
too optimistic at this point.

16:06.095 --> 16:07.227
You're right.

16:07.270 --> 16:08.445
What happens now?

16:08.489 --> 16:10.317
I think we should
respond to the e-mail.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.449
See if we can draw out
some more information.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.234
May-may I?

16:14.277 --> 16:15.757
Yes. Please.

16:18.325 --> 16:19.979
Uh, how's-
how's this?

16:20.022 --> 16:22.198
"Dear Lizzie,

16:22.242 --> 16:23.634
"is it really you?

16:23.678 --> 16:25.810
"It's hard to believe
after all these years.

16:25.854 --> 16:27.638
"Can you send me
something

16:27.682 --> 16:29.597
"so I know it's true?

16:29.640 --> 16:31.512
Henry."

16:32.774 --> 16:35.385
Okay.
We'll see what happens.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.823
Oh, in the meantime,
I was wondering--

16:38.867 --> 16:42.044
before Elizabeth disappeared,
she racked up a bunch of debt--

16:42.088 --> 16:44.786
do you have any idea
what that might be about?

16:44.829 --> 16:46.527
Debt?

16:46.570 --> 16:48.311
Lizzie?

16:48.355 --> 16:49.747
No, no, no, no.

16:49.791 --> 16:52.663
She was always responsible
when it comes to money.

16:52.707 --> 16:54.535
Nah, that doesn't seem like her.

16:54.578 --> 16:58.495
I know this is hard,
and it was such a long time ago,

16:58.539 --> 17:00.715
but if you could help us
understand why she had

17:00.758 --> 17:02.717
financial trouble, we
might gain some insight

17:02.760 --> 17:04.762
as to why she disappeared
in the first place.

17:04.806 --> 17:06.938
I don't know.
I don't know, damn...

17:06.982 --> 17:08.157
I don't know, damn it!

17:08.201 --> 17:10.333
I don't know.

17:11.117 --> 17:12.292
It's okay.

17:12.335 --> 17:14.424
Um, mood swings are common.

17:14.468 --> 17:16.470
Henry...[panting]

17:16.513 --> 17:17.819
[whispers]:
I don't know.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.386
Henry, can you
look at me?

17:20.822 --> 17:22.345
Good.

17:22.389 --> 17:24.521
That's good.

17:24.565 --> 17:27.829
Let's have a drink,
shall we?

17:29.570 --> 17:31.137
There you are.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.313
Just have a little sip.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.145
[panting]

17:42.974 --> 17:44.933
I'm sorry, but...

17:44.976 --> 17:46.978
have we met?

17:47.022 --> 17:48.763
Yes, yes.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.112
My name is Juliet Higgins.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.071
I'm an associate
of Mr. Magnum's.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.463
He's the private
investigator

17:53.507 --> 17:55.030
that you hired

17:55.074 --> 17:56.771
to find Elizabeth Cole.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.381
Elizabeth?Mm.

17:58.425 --> 18:00.470
Yes. Yes, Elizabeth.

18:00.514 --> 18:02.081
Yes.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.561
Yes.

18:22.971 --> 18:24.755
Feels good.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.757
So, what do you
say, Shammy?

18:26.801 --> 18:28.672
Want to get out
there with us?

18:28.716 --> 18:30.892
Come on,
look at it.

18:30.935 --> 18:33.547
It's perfect!

18:33.590 --> 18:36.680
I guess I'll
float around for a bit.

my wife.

19:48.099 --> 19:50.232
Vera. So nurturing.

19:50.276 --> 19:53.017
We never had children
of our own, unfortunately.

19:53.061 --> 19:56.107
But she treated each
one of my employees

19:56.151 --> 19:59.241
as if they were family.

19:59.285 --> 20:02.244
When Elizabeth and I broke up,
I suffered a minor stroke.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.290
I was barely
in my 50s.

20:04.333 --> 20:05.943
Vera...

20:05.987 --> 20:08.294
well, she was
my physical therapist.

20:08.337 --> 20:09.730
Helped me recover.

20:09.773 --> 20:12.689
She was also Reginald's sister.

20:12.733 --> 20:13.908
My house manager.

20:13.951 --> 20:15.953
But not as reserved.[chuckles]

20:15.997 --> 20:17.999
[computer chimes]HENRY:
He's a good man.

20:18.042 --> 20:20.044
The two of them got
me back on my feet.

20:20.088 --> 20:22.960
I'm alive
because of them.

20:23.004 --> 20:25.441
Only I never
regained use of my arm.

20:25.485 --> 20:28.792
But Vera and I fell
for each other.

20:28.836 --> 20:31.926
[laughs]We got a response.

20:31.969 --> 20:33.971
Higgins, can you, uh...?Yeah, on it.

20:34.015 --> 20:35.930
What's going on?

20:35.973 --> 20:37.627
Elizabeth responded
to the e-mail, and Higg...

20:37.671 --> 20:39.150
uh, sorry-- Juliet is trying

20:39.194 --> 20:40.630
to see where it
was sent from.

20:40.674 --> 20:43.459
They're using
a VPN this time.

20:43.503 --> 20:47.115
