WEBVTT

00:06.689 --> 00:09.620
<i>Apparently,</i> <i>
this is a highly concentrated</i> <i>
area for gold.</i>

00:13.827 --> 00:16.000
Seems like a really
cool opportunity.

00:16.034 --> 00:20.000
And, um... And if there's...
you know...

00:20.034 --> 00:21.896
...actually some gold
down there, it would be...

00:22.827 --> 00:23.827
<i>...pretty cool.</i>

00:27.310 --> 00:29.241
It's quite weird isn't it?
Normally you're getting out
of the water

00:29.275 --> 00:30.068
when there's sharks.

00:30.965 --> 00:32.931
We're gettin' in.
Well, Parker is.

00:32.965 --> 00:34.896
It would take me
a million dollars to jump
in right now.

00:34.931 --> 00:36.793
It looks like such
a nice place, do you know
what I mean?

00:36.827 --> 00:39.000
No! It looks shark-y.

00:40.793 --> 00:43.965
All right, Parker,
so I've got a little jar
we'll take down there

00:44.000 --> 00:46.827
'cause I'm quite fascinated
by the gold industry
in this area.

00:46.862 --> 00:49.793
So if you can fill
this up down there,
the most likely area,

00:49.827 --> 00:53.034
because all this valley
was mined for gold.

00:53.068 --> 00:56.586
No one's ever looked here,
and, uh, largely that's
because of the ocean,

00:56.620 --> 00:58.103
and perhaps it's
because of the sharks.

02:01.482 --> 02:02.517
Is that a great
white shark?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.517
There it is, right there!

02:09.551 --> 02:11.482
Right in front of him.
Right bang next to him.

02:31.310 --> 02:33.068
There's a hell of a lot
of snow up here, huh?

02:34.551 --> 02:35.931
It's, um...

02:35.965 --> 02:37.551
The temp, -16.

02:37.586 --> 02:40.551
This is why we mine
in the summer time.

02:42.551 --> 02:48.413
<i>Last season,</i> <i>
Parker Schnabel weighed in</i> <i>
$15 million of gold.</i>

02:48.448 --> 02:52.000
<i>A single season record</i> <i>
for the 27 year old miner.</i>

02:53.034 --> 02:55.586
<i>We had a good season,</i> <i>
we made money.</i>

02:55.620 --> 02:57.793
I'm gonna look back
on this season
as one of the,

02:57.827 --> 02:59.793
like, most productive
and easiest.

02:59.827 --> 03:02.068
<i>But, we're trying</i> <i>
to expand into Alaska.</i>

03:02.103 --> 03:07.689
We've the opportunity to take
10 years of really good
learning experiences...

03:07.724 --> 03:11.103
...and apply that
to an operation
fully from scratch.

03:12.620 --> 03:13.827
<i>Nine years ago...</i>

03:13.862 --> 03:16.689
<i>Parker left his grandpa's mine</i> <i>
in Alaska</i>

03:16.724 --> 03:19.413
<i>to strike it big in the Yukon.</i>

03:19.448 --> 03:22.655
I look upon you
like the eagle,
when they...

03:22.689 --> 03:24.827
...fluffs his wings
and flies outta the nest.

03:24.862 --> 03:29.724
<i>And since then</i> <i>
has mined nearly 50,000</i> <i>
ounces of gold,</i>

03:29.758 --> 03:32.793
<i>worth almost $70 million.</i>

03:32.827 --> 03:35.034
3,362.

03:36.724 --> 03:37.620
Good job!

03:38.172 --> 03:38.965
Thank you.

03:41.448 --> 03:43.931
<i>Now,</i> <i>
to grow his empire...</i>

03:43.965 --> 03:45.931
<i>...he's going back home.</i>

03:45.965 --> 03:49.137
Alaska has a ton
of really rich mining history.

03:49.172 --> 03:50.172
<i>Really good ground.</i>

03:50.758 --> 03:51.724
That's 100 ounces.

03:52.586 --> 03:53.620
Like, advanced payment.

03:53.655 --> 03:54.931
If you don't show up
next year,

03:54.965 --> 03:56.931
and you're not mining,
that's mine.

03:56.965 --> 03:59.206
<i>Located</i> <i>
just outside Fairbanks...</i>

04:00.137 --> 04:02.103
<i>...this historic gold</i> <i>
rich land</i>

04:02.137 --> 04:05.724
<i>could make Parker $11 million</i> <i>
in a single season.</i>

04:07.862 --> 04:09.896
Alaska really excites
me, you know?

04:09.931 --> 04:13.137
<i>But we don't have</i> <i>
that much time</i> <i>
to get this all setup.</i>

04:13.172 --> 04:17.482
<i>Parker has</i> <i>
just four months to boot up</i> <i>
an entire operation,</i>

04:17.517 --> 04:19.586
<i>and be mining in the spring.</i>

04:19.620 --> 04:24.413
We need pumps, generators,
light towers, backup pumps,
backup generators,

04:24.448 --> 04:26.448
<i>and we need to find</i> <i>
a wash plant.</i>

04:29.241 --> 04:30.172
<i>To help him...</i>

04:30.862 --> 04:32.413
Yeah, cool.

04:32.448 --> 04:34.758
<i>...Parker has asked</i> <i>
along Danny Etheridge.</i>

04:36.896 --> 04:38.241
"Meet him by the gold pan,"
he said.

04:39.931 --> 04:41.241
Nice touch.

04:41.275 --> 04:42.241
Pretty sure...

04:43.517 --> 04:46.931
...that the point
of putting me next
to a massive gold pan...

04:47.724 --> 04:49.275
...is to accentuate my size.

04:51.068 --> 04:53.000
<i>For three</i> <i>
off-seasons,</i>

04:53.034 --> 04:57.137
<i>Danny has been</i> <i>
by Parker's side</i> <i>
documenting every adventure.</i>

04:58.586 --> 04:59.379
Watch out!

05:01.379 --> 05:03.344
Hey!

05:03.379 --> 05:05.034
<i>Danny's been trying</i> <i>
to kill me for years.</i>

05:05.068 --> 05:08.103
These are the two largest
nuggets I have ever found.

05:08.137 --> 05:09.275
Shut up!

05:09.310 --> 05:11.310
<i>Danny, he's one</i> <i>
of my best friends.</i>

05:11.344 --> 05:14.827
<i>It's important to have people</i> <i>
around you that you like</i> <i>
to work with.</i>

05:14.862 --> 05:16.586
And it'll be good
to have Danny along.

05:16.620 --> 05:17.862
And, you know...

05:19.137 --> 05:20.482
...figure out, um...

05:21.965 --> 05:23.068
...figure out how
we're gonna...

05:24.724 --> 05:26.344
...solve some big
mining problems.

05:28.172 --> 05:29.758
I'm pumped.

05:29.793 --> 05:31.620
And, um, the best thing
about it--

05:33.413 --> 05:34.724
Oh my

05:36.689 --> 05:40.000
You make this normal
size gold pan look huge!

05:41.655 --> 05:43.862
Scared the
out of me, man.

05:45.413 --> 05:46.793
Oh, my

05:46.827 --> 05:47.655
Dude, look at you!

05:47.689 --> 05:49.758
I know, mate, I'm freezing.

05:49.793 --> 05:51.896
About 27 layers on.

05:53.448 --> 05:54.689
Better get used to it.

05:54.724 --> 05:56.137
We're going to the middle
of nowhere.

05:57.241 --> 05:58.448
- You ready to rock?
- Ready to rock.

06:00.137 --> 06:01.586
What is going on?

06:01.620 --> 06:05.344
I'm starting another operation
up in Alaska next summer.

06:05.379 --> 06:06.448
Amazing.

06:06.482 --> 06:08.586
So we need to get
a bunch of equipment,

06:08.620 --> 06:10.413
and a wash plant,
and all that stuff.

06:10.448 --> 06:13.103
And, like, the big
key pieces...

06:13.137 --> 06:15.517
...um, I wanna get
a big jump on.

06:15.551 --> 06:18.275
How much will it cost
to set up an operation
there in Alaska?

06:19.068 --> 06:20.310
5 million.

06:20.344 --> 06:21.344
What?

06:23.689 --> 06:24.724
You serious?

06:24.758 --> 06:25.758
Mmm-hmm.

06:25.793 --> 06:27.068
me.

06:27.103 --> 06:30.448
Doesn't actually buy you
very much in the steel world.

06:30.482 --> 06:32.896
You know,
prices have gone crazy.

06:32.931 --> 06:37.931
<i>Within Parker's</i> <i>
$5 million Alaska</i> <i>
startup budget...</i>

06:37.965 --> 06:42.793
<i>He set aside $1 million</i> <i>
for the most important</i> <i>
piece of equipment.</i>

06:42.827 --> 06:45.344
In terms of, like, building
a new operation,

06:45.379 --> 06:47.000
and what our goal
is this winter...

06:47.896 --> 06:48.896
...is like...

06:49.827 --> 06:51.482
We need to find
a wash plant...

06:51.517 --> 06:53.068
...first and foremost.

06:53.103 --> 06:57.275
And that's... you know,
that's the basis that
everything is built around.

06:57.310 --> 06:59.620
What's the plan?
Do you know where we're goin'?

06:59.655 --> 07:02.344
- There's a trommel for sale up here.
- Oh, wicked.

07:02.379 --> 07:05.724
Both our wash plants
in the Yukon are screen decks.

07:05.758 --> 07:08.172
But trommels can run
any type of material.

07:08.206 --> 07:10.413
And we run into,
even on the Indian river sometimes,

07:10.448 --> 07:13.275
not too often but sometimes,
we'll run into like clay
and whatnot.

07:13.310 --> 07:17.068
That's why Tony Beets
runs trommels
on Paradise hill.

07:17.103 --> 07:20.827
The stuff in Fairbanks
is pretty clean,

07:20.862 --> 07:23.000
but there's, like,
tons of clay in it.

07:23.034 --> 07:24.827
And... And you have to run
that in a trommel

07:24.862 --> 07:27.275
and beat it up
and really, you know,
massage it.

07:28.655 --> 07:29.827
This is the place.

07:30.655 --> 07:31.655
There.

07:33.586 --> 07:35.137
- All right, let's go look at this thing.
- Let's have a look.

07:38.137 --> 07:40.724
<i>This 15-year-old</i> <i>
turnkey trommel,</i>

07:40.758 --> 07:44.827
<i>has a list price of $66,000.</i>

07:44.862 --> 07:48.379
<i>Well within Parker's</i> <i>
$1 million wash plant budget.</i>

07:55.206 --> 07:57.068
It doesn't look
in that bad nick.

07:59.931 --> 08:02.551
From a...

08:02.586 --> 08:06.413
...design standpoint,
they're, like, you know,
very portable.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.758
Easy to move around.
It's on wheels,
that's a good idea.

08:10.793 --> 08:12.379
The problem with this
is that it's just too small.

08:12.413 --> 08:15.724
Like, this is a, you know,
50 or 60 yard
an hour wash plant.

08:15.758 --> 08:17.413
But...

08:17.448 --> 08:20.137
...if you had, like,
a supersized version
of this,

08:20.172 --> 08:22.206
I could see something
like that working.

08:22.241 --> 08:24.000
All right, I'm calling
the guy that owns this thing,

08:24.034 --> 08:25.000
and, um...

08:26.344 --> 08:27.310
...I'm gonna talk to him.

08:31.275 --> 08:32.310
Hey, Pete!

08:32.344 --> 08:33.482
<i>Hey buddy,</i> <i>
how's it goin'?</i>

08:33.517 --> 08:34.931
I'm standing next
to your trommel.

08:35.620 --> 08:36.620
<i>What do ya think?</i>

08:36.655 --> 08:39.724
Little small for our, uh...
for our setups.

08:40.517 --> 08:41.517
<i>It is a small trommel.</i>

08:41.551 --> 08:44.310
Yeah, yeah. You know,
it's definitely, um...

08:44.344 --> 08:47.275
I mean it fits the bill
in terms of being
super portable,

08:47.310 --> 08:49.034
and, um, compact.

08:49.068 --> 08:52.517
But... you know,
what is it?
60, 70 yards an hour?

08:52.551 --> 08:53.413
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:53.448 --> 08:55.034
Yeah, a little small for us.

08:55.068 --> 08:58.241
<i>I do have one at, uh,</i> <i>
a property I have out
in a place called Barkerville,</i>

08:58.275 --> 08:59.689
<i>which is in the Caribou</i> <i>
mountains.</i>

09:00.413 --> 09:01.482
Can we get to it?

09:01.517 --> 09:04.344
<i>You better have your, uh,</i> <i>
winter woollies,</i>

09:04.379 --> 09:06.551
<i>because it's quite a journey</i> <i>
to go see this thing.</i>

09:09.137 --> 09:11.206
He says dress warm
for the next place
we're goin'.

09:12.931 --> 09:15.000
The guy that's with me
is definitely dressed warm.

09:15.034 --> 09:16.931
He's got about eight
puffy coats on.

09:16.965 --> 09:20.586
<i>Think the weather forecast</i> <i>
is -25, so it's not too bad.</i>

09:20.620 --> 09:22.310
<i>But definitely</i> <i>
frostbite material.</i>

09:22.344 --> 09:23.827
All right.

09:23.862 --> 09:26.344
All right, we'll, um...
we'll head that way.

09:26.379 --> 09:27.206
<i>Come on up.</i>

09:27.241 --> 09:28.137
Yeah.

09:28.172 --> 09:29.000
<i>Talk soon.</i>

09:29.034 --> 09:30.000
Yeah, see ya soon.

09:30.551 --> 09:32.241
All right.

09:32.275 --> 09:34.620
- What're you smiling at?
- He's got another bigger trommel.

09:34.655 --> 09:36.724
- Right.
- And, um...

09:36.758 --> 09:39.862
And he said, "We can get
to it but it's out
in the middle of nowhere,

09:39.896 --> 09:41.965
so, like, dress warm."

09:42.000 --> 09:44.551
So, we'll see.
Hopefully the next one's in,
like, good shape,

09:44.586 --> 09:47.103
and, um, is something
that we want.

09:47.137 --> 09:48.275
All right, let's get
the out of here.

09:52.241 --> 09:57.275
<i>Parker and Danny</i> <i>
head 50 miles to the remote
mining outpost of Barkerville.</i>

09:59.551 --> 10:00.517
Ah, there we go.

10:02.620 --> 10:03.689
That him?

10:03.724 --> 10:05.482
- Yeah, that's Pete.
- Sweet.

10:06.689 --> 10:07.586
- Hey, man.
- Hey, kid!

10:07.620 --> 10:09.862
- How's it goin'?
- Good, how are you?

10:09.896 --> 10:12.241
<i>Mining gold,</i> <i>
since the age of 12...</i>

10:12.275 --> 10:15.758
<i>Pete Wright has 40</i> <i>
years' experience</i> <i>
in the industry.</i>

10:15.793 --> 10:16.620
I've heard lots about ya.

10:16.655 --> 10:18.000
I'm excited to find out.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.448
- I feel like it's a bit shrouded in mystery this trip.
- Yeah.

10:20.482 --> 10:21.379
What's goin' on?

10:21.413 --> 10:22.896
Yeah, well...

10:22.931 --> 10:24.137
We're talking
about trommels, man.

10:24.172 --> 10:26.586
Yeah, and you used
to mine around here, right?

10:26.620 --> 10:28.965
Well, yeah, I was here
for almost 15 years mining,

10:29.000 --> 10:30.310
I came down from the Yukon...

10:30.344 --> 10:32.931
- Gotcha.
- ...and, uh, started an operation down here.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.551
So where is this trommel at?

10:34.586 --> 10:39.000
The one that we're
goin' to look at
is the big monster barrel.

10:39.034 --> 10:40.344
Yeah, you know,
the biggest ones
you can build.

10:40.379 --> 10:41.724
Right, sweet.

10:41.758 --> 10:43.413
I'm lookin' forward
to checking it out.
Can we drive there?

10:43.448 --> 10:46.448
Yeah, we could drive there,
but... it's the middle
of winter, man.

10:46.482 --> 10:47.448
- On a snow machine?
- Yeah.

10:48.793 --> 10:50.586
So they're all tiny
little mining roads,

10:50.620 --> 10:52.413
and the only way
to get on 'em is these.

10:52.448 --> 10:53.620
- Gotcha.
- So...

10:53.655 --> 10:55.103
When's the last time
you were on a snow
machine, Dan?

10:55.137 --> 10:57.413
I was... I was on one
about six years ago.

10:57.448 --> 10:58.896
Dan, you cool with this?

10:58.931 --> 11:00.034
Yeah.

11:00.068 --> 11:01.965
I mean, what's the worst
that can happen?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.793
- Is that--
- There you go, I'm rubbing off on ya.

11:04.827 --> 11:06.896
Sounds like Parker's
got a bit more experience.

11:06.931 --> 11:08.172
All right.

11:09.517 --> 11:11.206
I'm good.

11:11.241 --> 11:13.413
- Danny, what is this?
- Huh?

11:13.448 --> 11:15.827
It's my... No, it's my...
It's just my snood.

11:15.862 --> 11:17.413
I... I haven't got
my snood, so...

11:18.344 --> 11:19.551
It's my pants.

11:19.586 --> 11:21.965
- It's... It's... It's a pair of underwear.
- It's fine.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.275
I haven't...
I haven't worn 'em.

11:24.758 --> 11:26.275
It's just my...
It's one leg of my pants,

11:26.310 --> 11:28.413
it's made of the same material
as a neckerchief anyways.

11:28.448 --> 11:29.448
It's fine.

11:30.137 --> 11:31.103
All right.

11:32.275 --> 11:34.482
What? It's fine.
It's all just, like...

11:35.758 --> 11:37.068
It's all made
of the same stuff!

11:40.103 --> 11:42.172
Which one of these
am I runnin'?

11:42.206 --> 11:44.827
Well... I'm thinking
of putting you
on something else.

11:44.862 --> 11:46.620
- Oh, yeah?
- How do you feel about riding a bike?

11:46.655 --> 11:47.586
A snow bike?

11:47.620 --> 11:49.620
Oh, yeah. That's my jam, dude.

11:49.655 --> 11:52.793
Well, come on over here then,
and see if you...
what you think about this one.

11:54.172 --> 11:55.206
A snow bike?

11:56.206 --> 11:58.448
Oh, yeah.
Pete, you're my hero.

11:58.482 --> 11:59.586
- Yeah, this thing is--
- I love this thing.

11:59.620 --> 12:00.827
Oh, my.

12:00.862 --> 12:03.275
<i>Made</i> <i>
from a converted</i> <i>
motor cross bike,</i>

12:03.310 --> 12:08.344
<i>the 55 horsepower engine</i> <i>
has a top speed</i> <i>
of 87 miles per hour.</i>

12:08.379 --> 12:09.689
It's state
of the art, man.

12:10.379 --> 12:11.724
Oh, yeah.

12:13.379 --> 12:14.413
Sweet!

12:16.793 --> 12:17.862
All right, we're gonna have
some fun today.

12:18.689 --> 12:20.000
Here we go!

12:29.344 --> 12:30.482
Come on!

12:34.068 --> 12:37.379
<i>From the historic</i> <i>
mining town of Barkerville...</i>

12:37.413 --> 12:42.551
<i>...Parker and Danny</i> <i>
travel 64 miles on a back</i> <i>
country adventure...</i>

12:42.586 --> 12:47.103
<i>...to check out</i> <i>
a trommel for sale</i> <i>
in the Caribou mountains.</i>

12:47.137 --> 12:51.758
<i>Where gold</i> <i>
was first discovered,</i> <i>
in the late 1850s...</i>

12:51.793 --> 12:54.379
<i>...and since then, the region</i> <i>
has produced</i>

12:54.413 --> 12:57.482
<i>nearly $50 million</i> <i>
worth of the metal.</i>

12:57.517 --> 12:58.482
Whoo!

13:05.724 --> 13:09.793
<i>After four hours</i> <i>
in freezing temperatures,</i> <i>
they reach the trommel.</i>

13:12.103 --> 13:13.793
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, it's a monster.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.310
Oh, my

13:15.965 --> 13:16.965
Holy cow.

13:17.655 --> 13:19.000
It's huge!

13:27.034 --> 13:27.965
That's it.

13:28.586 --> 13:30.206
It is 40 feet long...

13:31.206 --> 13:33.896
...by 6.5 foot diameter,
I think.

13:33.931 --> 13:35.586
It's a monster.

13:36.827 --> 13:39.965
<i>Parker is checking</i> <i>
out a huge trommel</i>

13:40.000 --> 13:42.241
<i>to give him a jump</i> <i>
on his mining season.</i>

13:43.793 --> 13:45.344
And I put an extra spray bar
in it.

13:45.379 --> 13:47.103
The six inch, you see...

13:47.137 --> 13:49.379
...had one and then I lined it
with excavator pads,

13:49.413 --> 13:50.724
if you look up
at the very front.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.137
She's a big yardage machine.

13:54.172 --> 13:55.724
Right.

13:55.758 --> 14:00.000
<i>With a price tag</i> <i>
of $225,000...</i>

14:00.034 --> 14:05.172
<i>Pete's custom built trommel</i> <i>
can chew through 150 yards</i> <i>
of clay pay dirt an hour.</i>

14:06.689 --> 14:09.655
<i>Recycled excavator pads</i> <i>
in the trommel</i>

14:09.689 --> 14:13.103
<i>break apart the gold</i> <i>
laden clay.</i>

14:13.137 --> 14:17.068
<i>And high pressure spray bars</i> <i>
wash the rocks clean...</i>

14:17.103 --> 14:18.931
<i>...releasing</i> <i>
the gold concentrate</i>

14:18.965 --> 14:21.517
<i>where it is caught</i> <i>
in the sluices below.</i>

14:22.379 --> 14:23.931
Chain drive?

14:23.965 --> 14:26.586
Yeah. So those are
the sluice boxes
that I built there.

14:27.448 --> 14:28.551
Boiler boxes.

14:28.586 --> 14:29.931
You can live
in this thing.

14:29.965 --> 14:31.586
Everything is oversized,
isn't it?

14:31.620 --> 14:33.379
It's like...
I feel like I'm in...

14:33.413 --> 14:36.034
- Remember that... that show <i>Land of the Giants?</i>
- Oh, yeah?

14:36.068 --> 14:37.862
It was originally
a propane drum.

14:38.448 --> 14:39.413
Yeah.

14:39.448 --> 14:41.241
Like three-quarters
to an inch thick.

14:41.275 --> 14:43.241
We can go up the ladder
and walk along the top

14:43.275 --> 14:44.448
if you wanna look
at the barrel.

14:45.206 --> 14:46.241
Where you goin'?

14:46.275 --> 14:47.896
I'm crawling right up
in here to...

14:47.931 --> 14:50.103
- Oh, you're goin' up there?
- ...to look at the...

14:50.137 --> 14:51.137
Hang on,
where's Parker goin'?

14:55.413 --> 14:58.896
Just be careful walking
on the top here.
I'll break a little trail up.

14:58.931 --> 15:01.482
'Cause there's a space
right here, right between
the spray bar.

15:04.068 --> 15:06.241
Like, footprint
is huge, right?

15:06.275 --> 15:07.517
It's a monster.

15:07.551 --> 15:09.896
These holes
are just cut with, like,
a torch, huh?

15:09.931 --> 15:12.793
Yeah, so the guy
put these in pretty
coarse ground here.

15:12.827 --> 15:15.896
so you just change it
with whatever size
of ground you're in.

15:15.931 --> 15:17.620
So if your holes are too big,

15:17.655 --> 15:19.482
you just put another
little tab overtop of them.

15:21.206 --> 15:23.758
So... And then it's got
this hole, like--

15:24.344 --> 15:25.620
Oh!

15:25.655 --> 15:26.862
Oh, man!

15:26.896 --> 15:28.517
Woah! What the

15:28.551 --> 15:29.793
Parker, are you okay?

15:31.379 --> 15:33.206
hell, mate.

15:33.241 --> 15:34.586
What the...

15:34.620 --> 15:35.482
Are you okay, buddy?

15:39.275 --> 15:41.241
Ah, it's so freakin' slick.

15:41.275 --> 15:43.586
"I know
how to walk
on circular things."

15:43.620 --> 15:46.000
Mate.

15:50.827 --> 15:52.620
Oh, it's gonna be
a cold ride home.

15:52.655 --> 15:53.620
You all right?

15:53.655 --> 15:54.655
I'm just cold.

15:54.689 --> 15:55.689
Oh, mate.

15:55.724 --> 15:57.862
I'm glad
there wasn't a big rock there.

15:57.896 --> 15:59.620
That's not the thing
you wanna be falling off...

15:59.655 --> 16:01.517
You could of smashed
his head off on that.

16:01.551 --> 16:03.758
Yeah, glad
I missed that.

16:03.793 --> 16:05.448
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

16:05.482 --> 16:06.827
- You sure?
- Yeah, I just like...

16:07.896 --> 16:09.655
- ...like mega brain freeze.
- Oh, mate.

16:11.689 --> 16:14.655
It's not... I'm totally fine,
but it's just, like,
my head...

16:15.655 --> 16:17.862
...just froze.
My brain stopped I think.

16:17.896 --> 16:19.275
Well, I can see that.

16:19.310 --> 16:21.206
Anyways, this is the size
we need

16:21.241 --> 16:23.206
- but this is not the trommel we're looking for.
- Really?

16:23.241 --> 16:24.310
- Yeah.
- Why?

16:26.586 --> 16:28.344
For us, the amount of hours
we run,

16:28.379 --> 16:30.896
- you need something that's really easy to work on.
- Yeah.

16:30.931 --> 16:34.724
And, like, the inside
the barrel of this
is all custom.

16:34.758 --> 16:35.758
And...

16:37.413 --> 16:40.344
...I think you'd have a hard
time, like...

16:40.379 --> 16:42.655
It'd be a full time job
for somebody maintaining it.

16:42.689 --> 16:44.689
A welder would spend
half a season on this
wash plant probably,

16:44.724 --> 16:46.793
if you were running it 24/7.

16:46.827 --> 16:49.551
<i>Reduce maintenance,</i> <i>
reduce downtime</i> <i>
to plant moves,</i>

16:49.586 --> 16:51.034
two big things for us.

16:51.068 --> 16:52.034
So...

16:53.655 --> 16:54.655
...not our wash plant.

17:13.206 --> 17:15.068
<i>Barkerville a bust,</i>

17:15.103 --> 17:19.379
<i>Parker and Danny head</i> <i>
450 miles south</i> <i>
to Vancouver island.</i>

17:20.896 --> 17:22.034
Where're we goin'?

17:22.068 --> 17:25.034
Visiting Jeff at Macon,
who built wash plants.

17:25.068 --> 17:27.517
He's an awesome dude,
they have a ton
of ideas.

17:27.551 --> 17:29.655
They've seen everything,
they've just, like,
been living

17:29.689 --> 17:31.310
in the wash plant trenches.

17:31.344 --> 17:34.344
I think he moved there
right after...

17:34.379 --> 17:37.517
...um, they built
Sluicifer for us.

17:37.551 --> 17:39.241
<i>Six years ago,</i>

17:39.275 --> 17:42.965
<i>Macon built Parker's</i> <i>
bespoke shaker deck,</i> <i>
Sluicifer.</i>

17:43.000 --> 17:44.482
Holy cow!

17:46.103 --> 17:48.620
<i>Capturing</i> <i>
over $30 million,</i>

17:48.655 --> 17:52.413
<i>Sluicifer is the jewel</i> <i>
in Parker's Yukon operation.</i>

17:54.793 --> 17:55.965
Hey, Jeff!

17:56.000 --> 17:57.586
- How's it goin, man?
- Good.

17:57.620 --> 17:59.413
- How are you?
- Good! Good to see ya.

17:59.448 --> 18:00.965
- This is Dan.
- Jeff.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.241
- Hey, Dan.
- Nice to meet you, mate.

18:02.275 --> 18:03.655
Thanks
for meeting us.

18:03.689 --> 18:05.517
- Yeah, no worries.
- Um, I was just hoping to have a chat with you

18:05.551 --> 18:06.965
about plants.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.896
- Yeah.
- And we're lookin' at buying another plant.

18:08.931 --> 18:12.137
And we've been looking
at a few of 'em,
but you know how it is

18:12.172 --> 18:14.931
- trying to find something used that will work for us--
- Yeah.

18:14.965 --> 18:16.310
...that will work
for what we need.

18:16.344 --> 18:18.137
- Something that will work for your ground?
- Right.

18:18.172 --> 18:19.310
- Good stuff, let's have a look!
- Cool!

18:21.620 --> 18:23.241
Oho, look at this!

18:24.862 --> 18:26.137
We got a 400 over here.

18:26.172 --> 18:27.379
Right.

18:27.413 --> 18:29.206
- It's a baby Sluicifer.
- Baby Sluicifer.

18:29.241 --> 18:30.655
It's just like
Sluicifer's had...

18:31.931 --> 18:34.896
...beautiful children with another wash plant.

18:34.931 --> 18:37.655
If only it had chosen
a trommel to procreate with,

18:37.689 --> 18:39.689
then we might
have our, uh, machine.

18:39.724 --> 18:42.586
I see the hoses,
there's gonna be hydraulics
going somewhere.

18:42.620 --> 18:45.482
Nope, those are for coming off
the self-cleaning filter.

18:45.517 --> 18:47.034
So there's a filter
inside of there?

18:47.068 --> 18:50.620
It's a... It's a screen
that the water passes over
cleaning the... Yeah.

18:50.655 --> 18:53.103
- It keeps itself clean and gives you water.
- Yes.

18:53.137 --> 18:55.931
Yeah, it would be nice
to see... see more plants.

18:55.965 --> 18:57.448
It's probably...
This is the wrong time of year

18:57.482 --> 18:58.344
to be looking at wash plants,
isn't it?

18:58.379 --> 18:59.379
It's the wrong time
of year, yeah.

18:59.413 --> 19:01.137
We got a couple plants
but they're not for sale.

19:01.172 --> 19:02.586
We don't have a lot here,

19:02.620 --> 19:04.655
but obviously the right time
of year you should be mining,
not here.

19:04.689 --> 19:06.862
Right, exactly,
and that's always been
the problem.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.586
Danny and I are always, like,
trying to figure out

19:09.620 --> 19:12.137
is it's... you know,
it's the middle of...
middle of winter

19:12.172 --> 19:15.965
and... and it's a tough
thing to be looking at ground,
or looking at wash plants,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.758
seeing mining operations,
when it's, you know...

19:18.793 --> 19:20.620
...right now it's -40
in Dawson.

19:20.655 --> 19:24.793
It's just tough for me
because this is my way
of looking at things,

19:24.827 --> 19:27.137
- like, on the ground crawling around wash plants.
- Yeah.

19:27.172 --> 19:29.620
It has been since I was
a little kid.

19:29.655 --> 19:31.827
A lot of these actual designs,

19:31.862 --> 19:34.275
they're... they're
from New Zealand, aren't they?

19:34.310 --> 19:36.448
Yeah, a lot of 'em
stem from New Zealand
for sure.

19:36.482 --> 19:39.482
I mean if we're serious
about looking at a bunch
of different wash plants...

19:39.517 --> 19:42.620
Um, then we should
just go to New Zealand.

19:43.517 --> 19:45.482
To New Zealand?

19:45.517 --> 19:48.172
It might be the only place
in the world that has a bunch
of them running.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.000
It's the right time
to be down there.

19:52.206 --> 19:53.896
<i>New Zealand...</i>

19:53.931 --> 19:56.724
<i>...world leaders</i> <i>
in wash plant design,</i>

19:56.758 --> 20:00.931
<i>where over 1,200 tons</i> <i>
of gold has been unearthed.</i>

20:00.965 --> 20:03.793
<i>The most efficient</i> <i>
operators, making money</i> <i>
on the leanest ground,</i>

20:03.827 --> 20:06.034
<i>has always been</i> <i>
New Zealanders.</i>

20:06.068 --> 20:08.034
<i>It's always been Kiwis.</i>

20:08.068 --> 20:11.413
<i>And they mine...</i> <i>
12 months of the year.</i>

20:11.448 --> 20:13.068
<i>There's a huge</i> <i>
history of mining.</i>

20:13.103 --> 20:15.862
<i>And for me, this may be</i> <i>
the college class</i>

20:15.896 --> 20:18.413
<i>on efficient placer mining,</i> <i>
making this trip.</i>

20:25.655 --> 20:27.068
You know,
mining seasons are short,

20:27.103 --> 20:29.241
but... off-seasons
are short as well.

20:30.517 --> 20:34.068
And... we don't have much time
to get this all set up,

20:34.103 --> 20:37.206
and start an entire new
mining operation.

20:37.241 --> 20:40.655
I have a lot riding on this
ground in Fairbanks.

20:40.689 --> 20:43.000
Like, we need to start
mining and getting gold
out of the ground,

20:43.034 --> 20:45.379
and that means
having a wash plant
and it all working.

20:45.413 --> 20:48.379
There's just not much time
to get things wrong,

20:48.413 --> 20:51.103
and so, I gotta
go to New Zealand.

20:51.137 --> 20:55.517
We're one plane trip away
from having the adventure
of our lives.

21:13.206 --> 21:14.793
Go and get
the gang back together.

21:14.827 --> 21:17.241
I honestly can't believe
that we're sat here
right now, man.

21:17.275 --> 21:19.137
This is ridiculous.

21:19.172 --> 21:22.448
In any business,
the most efficient survive,

21:22.482 --> 21:25.413
and the ones that are looking
at the most opportunities
survive, right?

21:25.448 --> 21:32.206
And that means learning
from the best of the best,
which are Kiwis.

21:32.241 --> 21:35.000
<i>From Vancouver,</i> <i>
Parker has traveled</i>

21:35.034 --> 21:38.862
<i>over 7,000 miles</i> <i>
to New Zealand...</i>

21:38.896 --> 21:42.517
<i>...home to some</i> <i>
of the most innovative</i> <i>
gold miners in the world.</i>

21:43.620 --> 21:46.310
Coming to New Zealand
and being able to, you know,

21:46.344 --> 21:50.068
see new technology is
gonna be really cool.

21:50.103 --> 21:54.862
I think the big risk here is
that we just don't have
a lot of time, like...

21:54.896 --> 21:59.586
I'm in the middle of planning
all of our Yukon mining
operation, you know,

21:59.620 --> 22:01.931
<i>the start-up</i> <i>
of an Alaskan operation,</i>

22:01.965 --> 22:04.241
and I'm hoping
that it's worth it.

22:04.275 --> 22:06.344
Right? Like...

22:07.758 --> 22:11.310
This could just snowball
into giving us

22:11.344 --> 22:14.379
a late start for the season
and not being prepared,

22:14.413 --> 22:18.517
so we definitely just
need to stay focused
on what the mission is.

22:18.551 --> 22:21.931
Fairbanks is gonna be full
of a whole lot of surprises,

22:21.965 --> 22:24.862
lots of clay, lots of very
difficult-to-recover gold,

22:24.896 --> 22:27.172
and we need a wash plant

22:27.206 --> 22:28.620
that can deal
with all of that,

22:28.655 --> 22:31.620
be high production
and be portable.

22:31.655 --> 22:33.068
You know,
it's a huge challenge.

22:33.689 --> 22:35.068
<i>Get this party started.</i>

22:41.586 --> 22:44.000
And there is our man
in Amsterdam.

22:45.068 --> 22:46.931
Come on, man.
Let's go see him. Let's do it.

22:49.344 --> 22:51.551
Mate, look at him.
Doesn't he look lonely?

22:51.586 --> 22:52.724
Jeff!

22:54.241 --> 22:56.827
<i>Wash plant guru</i> <i>
Jeff Turnell</i>

22:56.862 --> 22:58.655
<i>joins the team</i> <i>
on their mission</i>

22:58.689 --> 23:01.931
<i>to find the best turnkey plant</i> <i>
in the country.</i>

23:04.862 --> 23:06.000
- How's it going?
- Good.

23:06.034 --> 23:07.000
Hello, bud.

23:07.034 --> 23:08.655
I've always kinda been
in the mining industry

23:08.689 --> 23:10.517
since I was 17,

23:10.551 --> 23:12.862
um, dealing with wash plants.

23:12.896 --> 23:14.275
<i>When he called me</i> <i>
to go on this trip,</i>

23:14.310 --> 23:16.137
<i>it was definitely</i> <i>
out of the blue,</i>

23:16.172 --> 23:17.379
and I was pretty excited.

23:17.413 --> 23:19.517
- How's it going, man?
- Good, man. How are you?

23:19.551 --> 23:20.620
awesome.

23:20.655 --> 23:22.413
The most exciting thing
for me right now

23:22.448 --> 23:25.517
is, uh, I haven't had
a lot of time to do traveling

23:25.551 --> 23:27.862
and so, to be on a work trip

23:27.896 --> 23:31.896
and work with Parker,
I mean, it's pretty cool.

23:31.931 --> 23:34.689
This is definitely
the furthest I've
ever traveled

23:34.724 --> 23:36.551
and the biggest trip
I've ever been on.

23:36.586 --> 23:38.517
Where's Tyler?

23:42.413 --> 23:45.862
I'm very excited
to finally pick up the boys

23:45.896 --> 23:48.344
and meet Jeff.

23:48.379 --> 23:51.482
A bit nervous about
a new team member coming on.

23:51.517 --> 23:53.068
I'm sure it'll be fine.

23:53.103 --> 23:56.068
<i>The fourth</i> <i>
and final member of the team</i>

23:56.103 --> 23:58.827
<i>is Aussie gold miner</i> <i>
Tyler Mahoney.</i>

24:00.241 --> 24:02.862
<i>Two years ago,</i> <i>
she proved her worth</i>

24:02.896 --> 24:07.275
<i>when she guided Parker</i> <i>
on a prospecting trip</i> <i>
down under.</i>

24:07.310 --> 24:10.103
Uh, so this is where
the Welcome Stranger
nugget was found.

24:10.137 --> 24:12.655
Um, so that was
the biggest nugget
in the world.

24:12.689 --> 24:14.896
- That's nuts.
- It's cool, hey?

24:14.931 --> 24:18.000
I'm shaky.
That's a nice nugget.

24:18.758 --> 24:20.310
- For real?
- Yeah.

24:20.344 --> 24:22.275
Not bad, hey?

24:22.310 --> 24:26.551
Tyler and I have actually
a really solid relationship,
super good friends.

24:26.586 --> 24:30.379
Um, I trust her totally.

24:30.413 --> 24:32.827
<i>My role has</i> <i>
changed a lot.</i>

24:32.862 --> 24:35.689
I'm going to be
helping Park with contacts,

24:35.724 --> 24:37.758
getting him onto mine sites,

24:37.793 --> 24:40.034
finding wash plants
that are for sale,

24:40.068 --> 24:42.862
<i>but I'm definitely a lot more</i> <i>
out of my comfort zone</i> <i>
this time.</i>

24:46.448 --> 24:48.241
<i>For</i> <i>
the 7-week journey,</i>

24:48.275 --> 24:53.034
<i>Tyler's sourced</i> <i>
a 400 horsepower</i> <i>
Toyota M2 Overland.</i>

24:55.103 --> 24:59.586
<i>With a 4.2-liter engine</i> <i>
and 37-inch mud tires,</i>

24:59.620 --> 25:02.793
<i>it will be perfect</i> <i>
for New Zealand's</i> <i>
rough terrain.</i>

25:08.896 --> 25:12.931
Yes, Tyler.

25:12.965 --> 25:15.724
- Um, where did you get this from?
- Hi.

25:15.758 --> 25:17.275
- Nice rig.
- Hello, nice to meet you, Jeff.

25:17.310 --> 25:18.448
Yeah, nice to meet you.

25:18.482 --> 25:19.896
- Hello.
- How are you?

25:19.931 --> 25:21.793
- Good. Good to see you.
- Good to see ya.

25:21.827 --> 25:23.103
Hello, give me a hug.

25:23.137 --> 25:25.275
I like you even more
now you brought that.

25:25.310 --> 25:27.586
- Beautiful.
- How was that to drive down here?

25:27.620 --> 25:29.379
Uh, yeah,
it's a beast.

25:29.413 --> 25:31.758
You can definitely feel
the power of the vehicle.

25:31.793 --> 25:35.344
Oh, my.
Look at this.

25:35.379 --> 25:37.448
- You got any beer in here?
- Is that a fridge?

25:37.482 --> 25:38.896
- Yeah.
- It's not.

25:41.586 --> 25:43.344
- Have you filled that with beer?
- I should've.

25:43.379 --> 25:45.206
- Oh...
- There's nothing in it!

25:45.241 --> 25:46.620
That was
a rookie error.

25:46.655 --> 25:48.448
It was nearly at a perfect 10.

25:48.482 --> 25:49.724
This is sick.

25:50.482 --> 25:52.275
Pretty cool.

25:52.310 --> 25:54.000
I think that thing's
gonna go anywhere.

25:55.620 --> 25:56.896
Who's driving?

25:56.931 --> 25:59.517
- Parker?
- Hmm.

25:59.551 --> 26:00.655
You know I don't drive.

26:00.689 --> 26:02.344
Mmm, don't know
why I bothered asking that.

26:02.379 --> 26:04.620
Steering wheel's
on the wrong side for me.

26:04.655 --> 26:06.103
Jeff, you'd be fine.

26:06.137 --> 26:07.379
Oh, yeah, I'm obviously...

26:07.413 --> 26:09.275
Yeah, you've got
an easy out.

26:14.413 --> 26:15.724
Oh, yeah.

26:15.758 --> 26:16.689
Should we have a drive-off?

26:16.724 --> 26:18.793
We could do that.
Let's have a drive-off.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.000
And the winner drives.

26:20.034 --> 26:21.689
- A drive-off?
- Yeah

26:21.724 --> 26:22.896
Is that what's happening here?

26:22.931 --> 26:24.655
You and I are the judges,

26:24.689 --> 26:26.620
and we make
the decision, right?

26:26.655 --> 26:28.103
Have you ever driven
on the other side
of the road before?

26:28.137 --> 26:30.344
Never. This is
gonna be super confusing.

26:30.379 --> 26:31.965
Here you go.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.965
- I got shotgun.
- Jeff's up first then.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.793
me.

26:38.620 --> 26:39.724
All right.

26:39.758 --> 26:41.344
- Come on.
- Let's go.

26:41.379 --> 26:43.724
- Is it still, like, first is here?
- Yep.

26:43.758 --> 26:44.827
- It's in 4Hi?
- Oh!

26:44.862 --> 26:47.206
- It's in 4Hi.
- It's quite small in the back.

26:47.241 --> 26:50.068
If I'm saying
it's small in the back,
it's tiny.

26:51.689 --> 26:54.551
- <i>I'm just excited</i> <i>about starting the trip.</i>
- <i>I'm so excited.</i>

26:54.586 --> 26:57.793
<i>Oh, yes!</i> <i>
It's like butter.</i>

26:57.827 --> 26:59.413
Come on.

26:59.448 --> 27:01.724
<i>I mean, being able</i> <i>
to drive on the beach</i> <i>
is one thing.</i>

27:01.758 --> 27:02.965
You know, are you gonna
be able to drive

27:03.000 --> 27:06.413
on the wrong side of the road
is the other thing.

27:06.448 --> 27:08.689
I'm not being funny, guys.
I don't know if I can do
two months of this.

27:08.724 --> 27:10.793
Two months of what?

27:10.827 --> 27:12.000
This is bumpy.

27:12.034 --> 27:14.551
Are all the roads like this
in New Zealand?

27:14.586 --> 27:16.275
Oh, you should see
where we're going.

27:16.310 --> 27:18.241
There's a reason
we bought this car.

27:19.827 --> 27:23.206
<i>To kickstart their</i> <i>
trail around New Zealand,</i>

27:23.241 --> 27:25.103
<i>they must take</i> <i>
a coastal, off-road track...</i>

27:26.482 --> 27:28.724
<i>...and tackle</i> <i>
the Devil's Gate.</i>

27:30.137 --> 27:31.655
<i>Oh, my</i><i>
There it is.</i>

27:31.689 --> 27:33.551
That actually looks a bit...

27:33.586 --> 27:35.689
Danny,
the closer I get to that,

27:35.724 --> 27:37.034
that's steep.

27:37.068 --> 27:38.965
- That's what we're going over?
- Yeah.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.896
That looks fricking insane.

27:40.931 --> 27:42.379
Seriously?

27:42.413 --> 27:44.793
- Are you gonna be right?
- I don't know.

27:44.827 --> 27:46.620
- You guys ready?
- Go on, Jeff.

27:47.413 --> 27:48.862
Into the deep end, mate.

27:52.448 --> 27:53.655
<i>Oh, we are in low.</i>

27:56.620 --> 27:57.896
Meaty.

28:04.724 --> 28:06.896
Extreme driving hazards.

28:16.103 --> 28:18.206
Help! Oh, my [bleep]!

28:29.103 --> 28:31.379
Help! Oh, my [bleep]!

28:31.413 --> 28:35.206
I snapped the lens off my camera.

28:35.241 --> 28:38.068
That's not good at all.

28:38.103 --> 28:39.068
That is not good.

28:39.827 --> 28:42.482
Danny...

28:42.517 --> 28:45.586
Oh, my

28:45.620 --> 28:49.103
- That's really not good.
- That's really not good.

28:49.137 --> 28:51.689
- Have you ever done that before?
- No!

28:51.724 --> 28:52.896
Of course I haven't done that.

28:52.931 --> 28:55.517
In my entire career,
I've never done that before.

28:55.551 --> 28:57.103
I mean, it's...

28:57.137 --> 28:58.827
The thing is, it's not like...

28:58.862 --> 29:01.724
- It's not popped off, it's snapped off.
- It's snapped.

29:01.758 --> 29:04.620
Your reaction, as well, coming down...

29:04.655 --> 29:08.137
- "I've snapped it! I've snapped it!"
- What happened?

29:08.172 --> 29:10.931
And that's awesome.
That made my week.

29:12.931 --> 29:15.241
In 20 years of operating
the camera, I've never...

29:15.275 --> 29:19.310
I've never actually
snapped one off.

29:19.344 --> 29:21.551
So, uh, that happened.

29:21.586 --> 29:23.413
I can't believe
that's happened.

29:24.413 --> 29:27.206
But, um, no,
I've got another one.

29:27.241 --> 29:29.827
My last one
for the next couple of months.

29:29.862 --> 29:33.137
Tyler, you're on.

29:33.172 --> 29:37.275
<i>Now, it's Tyler's</i> <i>
turn to take the wheel.</i>

29:37.310 --> 29:38.793
- <i>You guys ready?</i>
- <i>Let's do this.</i>

29:38.827 --> 29:40.379
All right, come on in, Tyler.

29:40.413 --> 29:41.793
- All right.
- What you got?

29:43.517 --> 29:46.310
- I'm actually excited.
- Oh, yeah. You started it...

29:46.344 --> 29:47.827
You started it well.

29:47.862 --> 29:49.344
At least I can do that.

29:49.379 --> 29:52.517
- And hand brake off?
- I've done that, Danny, thank you.

29:52.551 --> 29:54.689
- And your fuel?
- Check, check, check.

29:56.344 --> 29:58.137
- Tyler...
- It's such a beast.

30:00.103 --> 30:03.137
Sorry.

30:05.551 --> 30:07.793
- Do you guys feel safe?
- Oh, yeah.

30:07.827 --> 30:10.000
- No.
- Parker, why are you looking so scared?

30:11.344 --> 30:13.620
Why are you
driving like a psycho?

30:13.655 --> 30:16.620
- I'm just driving.
- No, you aren't.

30:16.655 --> 30:19.275
You're headed straight for a tree!

30:19.310 --> 30:20.862
<i>Is this guy</i> <i>
gonna slow down?</i>

30:20.896 --> 30:22.517
Oh, Oh!

30:28.448 --> 30:31.827
- I'm sorry, guys. That was...
- Holy

30:31.862 --> 30:33.724
Did he not see us,
or did we not see him?

30:33.758 --> 30:35.344
He just waved
and said, "Thanks."

30:35.379 --> 30:37.448
- Aw, man.
- Let's take a look.

30:37.482 --> 30:39.793
- That feels really stuck.
- Stuck.

30:39.827 --> 30:41.206
Yeah, we're...

30:41.241 --> 30:43.931
- Oh, yeah, we're in here.
- Are we in deep?

30:43.965 --> 30:46.103
You're not happy
with my driving, are you?

30:46.137 --> 30:47.241
I don't know,
I felt like, you know,

30:47.275 --> 30:48.724
even though Jeff was
quite kinda rough,

30:48.758 --> 30:51.517
there was, you know,
he was kinda cool with it.

30:51.551 --> 30:56.000
My job definitely is making
phone calls, doing research,
connecting people.

30:56.034 --> 30:59.586
So if I'm driving,
I don't feel like I'll be able
to do both jobs properly.

30:59.620 --> 31:01.517
I'm happy in the backseat
with Danny.

31:01.551 --> 31:03.655
- Cool. We need to get on the move.
- Let's do it, then.

31:03.689 --> 31:05.103
We got places to go, right?

31:05.137 --> 31:06.724
Yeah, like South Island
bound, right?

31:06.758 --> 31:08.000
Yeah,
we're going south.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.689
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

31:20.517 --> 31:25.586
<i>The first leg</i> <i>
of their journey is a 60-mile
voyage across the Cook Strait.</i>

31:28.448 --> 31:30.172
All right, Tyler.
What do you have
planned for us?

31:30.206 --> 31:31.862
Let's do it, hey?
I'll show you.

31:31.896 --> 31:33.551
I've got a map planned
and ready to go.

31:33.586 --> 31:36.137
Parker called me literally,
like, three weeks ago,

31:36.172 --> 31:37.965
and I thought he was insane.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.172
I thought there was no way
we were gonna be able
to pull this off.

31:40.862 --> 31:42.103
<i>But we're here.</i>

31:42.137 --> 31:45.517
I'm glad we chose the, uh,
non-windiest part of the boat.

31:46.655 --> 31:49.689
- Tyler, you're so organized.
- Thank you, I try.

31:49.724 --> 31:53.310
- Mag mounts, how did you know?
- I know, I know.

31:53.344 --> 31:55.620
All right. There's
a lot going on here.

31:55.655 --> 31:57.379
<i>The majority</i> <i>
of the gold mining</i> <i>
in New Zealand</i>

31:57.413 --> 32:00.137
is going on on the West Coast
of the South Island,

32:00.172 --> 32:02.275
um, some really
impressive wet plants

32:02.310 --> 32:04.241
and a lot of fine gold.

32:04.275 --> 32:05.689
That's what
New Zealand's known for,

32:05.724 --> 32:06.793
and that's what
Parker wanted to see.

32:08.689 --> 32:11.137
<i>From Wellington,</i> <i>
Parker and the team</i>

32:11.172 --> 32:13.965
<i>are heading to New Zealand's</i> <i>
South Island,</i>

32:14.000 --> 32:17.275
<i>where they'll focus
their search on the West Coast</i>

32:17.310 --> 32:19.586
<i>and the Otago mining region,</i>

32:19.620 --> 32:24.379
<i>that together have produced</i> <i>
$34 billion in gold.</i>

32:25.827 --> 32:27.793
Through here is
a place called Ross,

32:27.827 --> 32:29.172
which is where...

32:30.206 --> 32:31.655
- ...this was found.
- Holy

32:31.689 --> 32:33.655
It's a replica
of Honourable Roddy,

32:33.689 --> 32:36.620
which was the biggest nugget
ever found in New Zealand.

32:36.655 --> 32:38.241
- Seriously?
- Oh, wow.

32:38.275 --> 32:39.827
Holy

32:39.862 --> 32:40.827
Pretty cool, hey?

32:40.862 --> 32:43.034
It's one piece?

32:43.068 --> 32:46.655
It was, um, 100 ounces,
99.6 or something like that.

32:46.689 --> 32:49.689
- That's unreal.
- No, it's definitely cool.

32:51.551 --> 32:53.931
We've got a lot
of stuff to do, um...

32:53.965 --> 32:55.620
You know,
it's not gonna be easy.

32:55.655 --> 32:58.379
<i>Gold miners are</i> <i>
very secretive and elusive.</i>

32:58.413 --> 33:03.689
<i>But ultimately, New Zealand's
home to some of the, you know,
best gold miners in the world.</i>

33:14.655 --> 33:16.724
Come on, man. This is good.

33:16.758 --> 33:18.758
Jeff, what are you
looking forward to, man?

33:18.793 --> 33:21.413
Checking out some
of the wash plants

33:21.448 --> 33:22.931
that I've never seen before.

33:22.965 --> 33:24.758
There's some really
impressive mining going on.

33:24.793 --> 33:26.310
There's a lot of gold
coming out.

33:26.344 --> 33:30.034
A lot of Kiwis left here
and went to the Yukon

33:30.068 --> 33:31.655
because the ground there
was way better,

33:31.689 --> 33:33.137
and they took
their technology,

33:33.172 --> 33:35.206
went to the Yukon,
and made a pile of money.

33:35.241 --> 33:37.206
<i>There's no degree</i> <i>
for placer mining.</i>

33:37.241 --> 33:38.172
It's the only way
to learn this,

33:38.206 --> 33:41.413
is to do it and to learn
from the best.

33:41.448 --> 33:45.931
- We are in the land of plenty.
- Yeah.

33:45.965 --> 33:48.965
Adventure's always been
a big part of these trips,

33:49.000 --> 33:53.931
and, um, you know,
New Zealand's got a lot
of infrastructure for that.

33:53.965 --> 33:56.275
And it's fun
to bring people in

33:56.310 --> 33:58.793
<i>and put them</i> <i>
in this pressure cooker</i>

33:58.827 --> 34:01.137
<i>where you're living together</i> <i>
and traveling together,</i>

34:01.172 --> 34:03.241
<i>and being thrown</i> <i>
into difficult situations</i>

34:03.275 --> 34:05.068
<i>and things</i> <i>
outside your comfort zone</i>

34:05.103 --> 34:08.620
<i>and seeing how people</i> <i>
deal with those scenarios.</i>

34:08.655 --> 34:10.793
There's a whole bunch
of awesome things to do
in the country,

34:10.827 --> 34:12.448
and I wanna do them all.

34:18.034 --> 34:20.517
Man, I've always
wanted to do this!

34:23.586 --> 34:25.758
<i>Before visiting</i> <i>
their first gold mine,</i>

34:25.793 --> 34:27.724
<i>Parker is putting his new crew</i>

34:27.758 --> 34:29.896
<i>to the ultimate</i> <i>
team-building test...</i>

34:31.034 --> 34:35.344
<i>...a 13,000-foot trust fall.</i>

34:35.379 --> 34:38.034
So, I need the guys
jumping to fill these forms.

34:38.068 --> 34:41.172
- I'll just sign it.
- Is there an app on here to do a quick will, too?

34:41.206 --> 34:44.241
I don't have a will.
Should probably leave
everything to Dozer.

34:44.275 --> 34:46.310
Doze man.

34:46.344 --> 34:48.000
I'm secretly myself.

34:52.344 --> 34:53.482
<i>Coming up...</i>

34:55.827 --> 34:57.724
<i>Parker goes off the grid...</i>

34:57.758 --> 34:59.551
I'm just waiting
for the dinosaurs.

34:59.586 --> 35:01.206
I feel like
I'm in <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

35:01.241 --> 35:03.172
<i>...to find gold.</i>

35:03.206 --> 35:04.655
<i>They're all</i> <i>
getting</i><i>rich.</i>

35:05.379 --> 35:07.862
Oh, man. Look at that.

35:14.379 --> 35:17.103
<i>Before beginning</i> <i>
their 7-week mission,</i>

35:17.137 --> 35:20.758
<i>the team receive</i> <i>
a traditional welcome</i> <i>
to the South Island</i>

35:20.793 --> 35:22.241
<i>by the local Maori.</i>

35:22.275 --> 35:24.068
- Parker.
- Renee.

35:24.103 --> 35:25.137
So, that was the hongi.

35:25.172 --> 35:26.448
That's how Maori greets,

35:26.482 --> 35:29.103
and when you press noses,
you become as one.

35:30.827 --> 35:33.517
<i>A rite of passage,</i> <i>
once received,</i>

35:33.551 --> 35:37.275
<i>the team are seen</i> <i>
as more than just guests</i> <i>
to the island.</i>

35:44.206 --> 35:46.000
<i>I wasn't</i> <i>
expecting this at all.</i>

35:46.793 --> 35:47.931
It was very, very emotional.

35:50.862 --> 35:54.586
It's really hard to explain.
It's just, like, overwhelming.

35:57.034 --> 36:02.517
<i>There's not a lot</i> <i>
of intact cultures that have
kept these kind of traditions,</i>

36:02.551 --> 36:04.724
and it's really,
really cool to be here

36:04.758 --> 36:07.517
and to be invited in this way,
in the traditional way.

36:18.620 --> 36:20.793
My balls feel like
they're in the danger zone.

36:21.655 --> 36:22.827
You know what I mean?

36:24.448 --> 36:27.517
<i>Parker is testing</i> <i>
the strength of his team</i>

36:27.551 --> 36:31.310
<i>with a 13,000-foot</i> <i>
tandem skydive.</i>

36:31.344 --> 36:33.620
I definitely like warriors
around me.

36:33.655 --> 36:35.862
I like people
who are battle-hardened.

36:35.896 --> 36:37.758
I'm ready. Let's just do it.

36:46.517 --> 36:48.068
<i>You all right, Jeff?</i>

36:52.206 --> 36:53.241
It's real now.

36:53.655 --> 36:55.206
<i>Yeehaw!</i>

37:02.413 --> 37:05.896
<i>First</i> <i>
to take the plunge is</i> <i>
the team's greenhorn.</i>

37:14.137 --> 37:15.931
Whoa!

37:15.965 --> 37:19.517
One of my keys to success
is definitely keeping
people around me

37:19.551 --> 37:20.896
that will keep me in check,

37:20.931 --> 37:22.896
and on this trip,
Jeff's that person.

37:22.931 --> 37:24.000
He's gonna keep me in check.

37:24.034 --> 37:26.482
There's too much pressure
on having a plant

37:26.517 --> 37:28.758
that's operational this summer
for Fairbanks.

37:33.310 --> 37:34.793
Oh, my [bleep]!

37:42.344 --> 37:43.620
<i>Tyler,</i> <i>
she's really good</i>

37:43.655 --> 37:45.068
<i>at getting access to things.</i>

37:45.103 --> 37:47.482
<i>Just, like, talking her way</i> <i>
onto properties.</i>

37:47.517 --> 37:50.586
She has a way with people
that I have sometimes,

37:50.620 --> 37:52.793
but not most
of the time.

37:59.655 --> 38:02.724
<i>Super excited to start getting</i> <i>
to some of these mine sites,</i>

38:02.758 --> 38:06.827
getting our feet on the ground
and really start tuning in
to what we want

38:06.862 --> 38:08.620
for a wash plant for Parker,

38:08.655 --> 38:11.896
because the mining season's
coming pretty soon.

38:14.689 --> 38:16.724
Oh, my [bleep]!

38:16.758 --> 38:19.137
That was so much fun!

38:19.172 --> 38:21.241
<i>Time is definitely</i> <i>
of the essence.</i>

38:21.275 --> 38:26.000
Look, I wanna squeeze in
as much gold and wash plants
and contacts as I can.

38:26.034 --> 38:28.034
<i>I've got a couple things</i> <i>
up my sleeves.</i>

38:28.068 --> 38:30.137
We're gonna see
some great wash plants.

38:42.310 --> 38:46.206
That's so crazy.
It's really cool.

38:46.827 --> 38:48.413
Beautiful.

38:49.068 --> 38:50.482
I bet this doesn't get old.

38:54.724 --> 38:56.034
the bed.

38:58.896 --> 39:00.620
<i>Now, like,</i> <i>
we're all good buddies,</i>

39:00.655 --> 39:04.172
we can really
sort of just knuckle down

39:04.206 --> 39:05.931
and concentrate
on the job at hand.

39:08.965 --> 39:12.241
I feel like we could be on one
of the hottest trips yet.

39:12.275 --> 39:14.482
<i>I always</i> <i>
find comfort in knowing</i> <i>
if hits the fan,</i>

39:14.517 --> 39:17.551
<i>I'm around people</i> <i>
that would have my back.</i>

39:17.586 --> 39:21.068
And, um,
might hit the fan.

39:22.275 --> 39:23.517
So that's always good.

39:23.551 --> 39:26.793
It's always good
to have that feeling
and that level of trust.

39:28.034 --> 39:29.310
How'd it go?

39:29.344 --> 39:30.517
It was fricking awesome.

39:33.551 --> 39:34.448
Little bit.

39:36.379 --> 39:37.758
Oh, oh.

39:38.965 --> 39:41.517
- Oh, what just happened?
- Dan!

39:43.103 --> 39:44.827
Oh, man.

39:44.862 --> 39:48.275
I screamed, "Mummy!" for, like, one-third of it.

39:48.310 --> 39:49.724
Dude.

39:49.758 --> 39:53.034
It's like pure ecstasy
and wanting to puke
at the same time.

39:54.172 --> 39:55.034
Oh, my...

39:56.482 --> 39:58.344
<i>We need to get lean</i> <i>
and we need to get mean.</i>

39:58.379 --> 40:01.689
<i>But in terms of the team here,</i> <i>
the four of us...</i>

40:01.724 --> 40:05.068
Yeah, I think it's a very
good recipe for success.

40:07.034 --> 40:09.965
<i>This season</i> <i>
on</i> Parker's Trail...

40:10.000 --> 40:11.793
<i>I've set $1 million</i> <i>
aside to do this.</i>

40:13.344 --> 40:14.448
<i>I can't think</i> <i>
of a better place</i>

40:14.482 --> 40:17.137
to buy a big,
badass wash plant.

40:17.172 --> 40:18.965
<i>Their mining's</i> <i>
super-efficient.</i>

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
<i>They're all getting rich.</i>

40:21.034 --> 40:22.551
Oh, man.

40:22.586 --> 40:23.931
Look at that.

40:23.965 --> 40:26.655
We have to find the people
that have pioneered
the technology

40:26.689 --> 40:28.310
<i>and developed these ideas.</i>

40:28.344 --> 40:30.034
<i>We have to go and learn</i> <i>
from the best.</i>

40:30.068 --> 40:31.793
Cheating a wee bit,
I would call it.

40:33.482 --> 40:35.793
<i>Are you</i> <i>
the only one in this area</i> <i>
with this exact wash plant?</i>

40:35.827 --> 40:37.000
It's the only one
in the world.

40:37.482 --> 40:38.724
sick.

40:38.758 --> 40:40.931
Everyone likes to keep
their cards close to them.

40:42.655 --> 40:44.034
He just laughed in my face.

40:45.206 --> 40:46.310
<i>...is locked.</i>

40:46.344 --> 40:47.896
<i>I don't know</i> <i>
if that's a good idea, guys.</i>

40:47.931 --> 40:49.896
Hey! You're not meant
to be in here.

40:49.931 --> 40:51.448
This is gonna be tough.

40:51.482 --> 40:53.620
You still haven't
actually chose if you want
a shaker deck or a trommel.

40:53.655 --> 40:56.310
Don't tell me
what the to do.

40:56.344 --> 40:58.068
I'm sure it won't be
all business, you know?

40:58.103 --> 41:00.344
You've always gotta have
a little bit of fun mixed in.

41:01.758 --> 41:04.000
Oh,
my [bleep], I wet myself.

41:05.068 --> 41:05.965
Come with me.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.448
<i>This is epic.</i>

41:07.482 --> 41:10.241
<i>That is so blue.</i>

41:10.275 --> 41:11.413
- Oh, my [bleep]!
- Ah!

41:11.448 --> 41:13.068
Oh, my...

41:14.103 --> 41:15.206
Just hold on.

41:16.758 --> 41:18.620
I'm just waiting
for the dinosaurs.

41:18.655 --> 41:20.172
I feel like
I'm in <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

41:20.206 --> 41:21.034
Now?

41:22.517 --> 41:24.103
Wow.

41:24.137 --> 41:25.413
Oh, my

41:29.241 --> 41:30.275
I think we should
get out of here.

41:30.310 --> 41:31.655
They're talking price here.

41:31.689 --> 41:32.896
You wanna sell me the plant?
