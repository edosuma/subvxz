Not yet.

11:32.983 --> 11:35.986
All three of you take your lunch hour
and come up with a mission statement

11:36.070 --> 11:37.405
as to why I should pick you,

11:37.488 --> 11:39.323
and I'll make my decision
at the end of the day.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.076
You know what I like doing
on my lunch hour? Lunch.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.539
We all know you're gonna go with Abby
to teach the honor students.

11:46.622 --> 11:47.540
[clicks tongue] Aw!

11:47.623 --> 11:48.708
Well, I like to think

11:48.791 --> 11:51.210
that all of our students
are honors students.

11:51.919 --> 11:54.714
And I'd like to think Idris Elba is
at home, waiting for me.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.719
Come on, Tony, surprise me.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.011
Don't suck so much.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.808
You know, when a coach picks on you,
that means you're the star player.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.436
Hmm. Sometimes, it just means you're bad.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.191
[Gabe] Come on, Paula.

12:14.275 --> 12:17.528
We both know you should go with me.
No one teaches history like I do.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.488
I know. You're good.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.782
That's why I let you slide
with the dress code.

12:23.492 --> 12:24.618
What?

12:24.910 --> 12:27.621
You can't hide these calves
from the rest of the world.

12:29.790 --> 12:30.666
Oh, that hurt.

12:32.626 --> 12:33.669
[sighs]

12:34.003 --> 12:36.547
You got your assignment, Gabe.
I'll see you after lunch.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.632
I can't get my leg off.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.101
[groans]

12:49.769 --> 12:50.603
You okay?

12:50.686 --> 12:53.022
You need some alone time in your Elantra?

12:55.733 --> 12:58.360
My kid is graduating from middle school
next week,

12:58.444 --> 13:01.030
and my ex-husband, the first one,
is going to be there.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.865
You meet the love of your life
at Freaknik,

13:02.948 --> 13:04.492
and you think it's gonna last.

13:06.118 --> 13:07.953
Gabe, he's bringing his young wife.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.539
I've been looking for a guy all year,
but apparently,

13:10.623 --> 13:13.959
I'm giving Southern California
carpal tunnel from swiping left.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.086
You still got it.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.839
You're smart, you're pretty,
you're strong.

13:19.089 --> 13:20.633
You're an amazing administrator.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.885
Is this all a part
of your mission statement?

13:23.636 --> 13:24.970
If it's working, then yes.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.850
[Walt] Mr. Iglesias!

13:30.142 --> 13:31.894
-[Gabe] Oh, hey, Walt.
-Great news.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.229
I'm graduating early.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.980
[chuckles]
Graduating? What're you talking about?

13:35.356 --> 13:37.316
Check it out,
I got a letter from Mr. Hernandez.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.319
"Counseled... out."

13:41.028 --> 13:43.989
Walt, you're not graduating,
you're-- you're being expelled.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.200
Well, I think we can agree,

13:46.283 --> 13:48.619
the important thing is,
I don't have to come back!

13:50.704 --> 13:52.957
School didn't want me,
and I've never wanted it.

13:53.040 --> 13:56.001
This is a no-fault divorce.
Just like my folks.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.130
So, what next? Goldman Sachs?

14:00.506 --> 14:03.092
Foot Locker.
I'll make those stripes look good.

14:04.468 --> 14:08.222
Yeah, I doubt that. I used to work there.
Heh. I looked like a fat barcode.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.140
[sighs]

14:10.224 --> 14:12.017
I think you can do better
than Foot Locker.

14:13.394 --> 14:14.895
You know what I'd really like to sell?

14:14.979 --> 14:17.648
Did the state of California legalize it
in 2016?

14:18.941 --> 14:22.361
I was gonna say custom rims,
but I like your idea way better.

14:22.444 --> 14:23.445
Thanks, Mr. Iglesias!

14:23.529 --> 14:25.906
Uh, wait, no-- Uh--
You know, I was thinking shoe--

14:25.990 --> 14:28.534
-People need shoes!
-[Walt] Not as much as they need weed!

14:28.617 --> 14:30.911
Yeah, but they need the shoes
to get to the weed!

14:34.707 --> 14:35.541
Hey, Tony.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.002
Any of your students
get this weird letter?

14:38.210 --> 14:40.254
Maybe. We're not that close.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.757
Hey, can you help me
with my mission statement?

14:45.009 --> 14:47.428
Sure. I can't believe
I'm still doing your homework.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.389
Just get me started.

14:50.806 --> 14:54.101
All right. Uh...
Why do you wanna teach the honors program?

14:54.435 --> 14:55.978
Because it'd be way easier.

14:57.104 --> 14:58.230
Lead with that.

15:00.274 --> 15:02.026
You know, Tony,
have you ever had a student

15:02.109 --> 15:03.235
who was afraid to try?

15:03.319 --> 15:04.695
Yeah, that's half my kids.

15:04.904 --> 15:05.779
Yeah.

15:06.780 --> 15:09.158
And they worry
that if they try their hardest then fail,

15:09.241 --> 15:11.827
they can't ever use the excuse
that they weren't really trying?

15:12.328 --> 15:13.579
Yeah, I see it all the time.

15:13.787 --> 15:15.915
Well, this isn't about my students,
this is about...

15:18.834 --> 15:22.212
Oh! I see what you did there.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.342
Gabe? I know we're competing
against each other,

15:26.425 --> 15:28.928
-but would you proof my mission statement?
-You too?

15:29.178 --> 15:30.262
[scoffs]

15:30.679 --> 15:32.932
Charts? You got charts?

15:34.642 --> 15:35.684
And a bibliography?

15:35.768 --> 15:39.313
Yeah. Is it tacky that I cited
my own grad school thesis?

15:39.605 --> 15:40.606
[both] Yes!

15:42.733 --> 15:45.235
-Wait. Is this PowerPoint?
-Mm-hmm.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.655
You really do speak the language
of the honors kids.

15:47.738 --> 15:48.572
Oh, thank you!

15:48.656 --> 15:49.782
I also speak French.

15:50.157 --> 15:52.701
Tu es très gentil, mon petit chou.

15:55.704 --> 15:57.081
-What did that mean?
-I don't know,

15:57.164 --> 15:58.958
but I've never been called "petite."

16:05.965 --> 16:06.840
Hey, Mikey.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.301
[sighs] You got a letter, too?

16:10.427 --> 16:12.012
Ah, it's probably just a bill.

16:12.096 --> 16:15.182
At my house, we don't open those
till the one after final-final notice.

16:15.265 --> 16:16.266
[chuckles]

16:16.642 --> 16:17.518
Yeah, I get it.

16:17.601 --> 16:20.396
You know, growing up, we were on
a first-name basis with our repo man.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.940
Yeah, Hector the collector
even came to my graduation.

16:23.691 --> 16:27.361
-[scoffs] Are you gonna pay that for me?
-No, but someone is gonna pay for this.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.155
Yo, yo, wait up, wait up!
I got more bills!

16:31.365 --> 16:32.741
[Paula] ...to say...

16:33.075 --> 16:36.453
-[scoffs] We're in a meeting!
-Yeah, and I'm in it too. Hi.

16:39.665 --> 16:40.708
What do you want, Gabe?

16:41.333 --> 16:43.919
What's up with these letters?
And what the hell is "counseled out"?

16:44.003 --> 16:47.506
It's a nice way of saying
to our underperforming students,

16:47.589 --> 16:51.176
"Dear dumb ass, get lost.
Kmart is hiring." [laughs]

16:55.431 --> 16:56.807
[Gabe] "Attention Kmart shoppers,

16:56.890 --> 16:59.184
pay no attention
to the idiot on aisle five."

17:01.186 --> 17:06.233
[speaking Spanish] ...aisle five.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.236
[Paula] Gabe, we are a public school.

17:09.486 --> 17:11.822
Our funding depends on meeting
certain standards:

17:11.905 --> 17:14.074
grades, discipline, attendance levels.

17:14.158 --> 17:16.785
And the easiest way
to improve those averages

17:16.869 --> 17:19.413
is to counsel out the kids
who are hurting the numbers.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.248
What do you call this program?

17:21.832 --> 17:23.500
"Some Children Left Behind"?

17:24.960 --> 17:26.003
I don't hate it.

17:30.883 --> 17:34.553
This program could make our school
the educational pearl of the district.

17:35.596 --> 17:36.638
Yeah.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.183
All you gotta do is swipe left
on a bunch of kids.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.769
[door opens]

17:42.519 --> 17:43.854
What's "swipe left"?

17:46.857 --> 17:49.068
The story of my damn life.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.948
-[exhales] Ah, Mr. Hayward!
-Hey!

17:55.032 --> 17:56.950
Have you heard about
these "counseled out" letters?

17:57.034 --> 17:58.952
The "not our problem anymore" letters.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.329
Yeah, sure.

18:01.038 --> 18:04.333
Always easier to juke the stats
than reach the hard cases.

18:05.375 --> 18:07.878
Something tells me
I need to sit down for this.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.339
[sighs]

18:10.422 --> 18:14.384
Gabriel, when I was about your age,
I got a job offer at a private school.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.428
You know,
where the students wear cardigans

18:16.512 --> 18:18.013
with the crests on them.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.473
Hogwarts.

18:20.933 --> 18:21.767
Yeah.

18:22.643 --> 18:25.479
Then, at lunch,
a couple of kids got in a little scrap.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.482
As I was stopping the fight,
one of the kids hit me,

18:28.565 --> 18:31.860
and that's when I knew
I needed to be here.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.737
Hit you so hard it gave you dementia.

18:33.821 --> 18:34.655
[Ray] No.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.158
See, I knew what that kid
was dealing with at home,

18:38.242 --> 18:41.245
and I knew what would've happened
if that kid had hit any other teacher.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.579
If you had left,

18:42.663 --> 18:44.414
you wouldn't have been here
when I was on the ropes.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.126
You were one of the kids that let me know
I was doing the right thing.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.753
Wow. [chuckles softly]

18:49.837 --> 18:52.172
I wonder where I would've wound up
without you, Mr. Hayward.

18:52.422 --> 18:55.008
Well, you'd have been
in some low-paying job

18:55.092 --> 18:56.301
with lots of stress,

18:57.261 --> 18:58.428
long hours...

19:00.514 --> 19:02.516
[both laughing]

19:07.771 --> 19:09.690
Hey, there she is.
Always reading something.

19:10.065 --> 19:11.441
Yeah, my obituary.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.903
[sighs] No way.
Oh, they've gone too far now.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.281
You're not just my best student,
you're my favorite student.

19:17.364 --> 19:18.907
We know you say that to all of us.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.827
Yeah, I know, but when I'm talking to you,
I'm not lying.

19:23.078 --> 19:27.958
Letter says it's 'cause of attendance.
I kinda missed some afternoon classes.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.877
-Like how many?
-Like all of them.

19:31.503 --> 19:34.840
I work to help my family,
but I did the assignments.

19:35.048 --> 19:37.843
[sighs] I'm gonna take this to somebody
who can help fix it.

19:38.135 --> 19:41.305
Oh, my God,
are you gonna have Hernandez jumped?

19:43.056 --> 19:44.892
No, but I like your idea much better.

19:47.728 --> 19:52.232
Mm... I can't find any central database
for the kids who got the letter.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.277
If I can't access the list,
I can't change it.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.070
And believe me, I need to.

19:59.448 --> 20:02.409
Wait, you too?
Well, why did you get a letter?

20:02.951 --> 20:04.328
For doing stuff like this.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.373
That's right. That's... [chuckles]
That's why I called you here.

20:08.457 --> 20:09.499
Um...

20:11.001 --> 20:13.670
I need your help getting Principal Madison
in a good mood.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.631
Just get a pitcher of appletinis in her.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.303
I don't even wanna know how you know that.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.764
It's on her profile.

20:24.056 --> 20:28.268
"Just get a pitcher of appletinis in me,
and let the magic happen."

20:32.231 --> 20:33.523
You know, Grace,

20:33.732 --> 20:37.277
I want you to know how proud I am of you
and how far you've come this year,

20:37.694 --> 20:39.029
in case I get fired.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.242
Fired? Why would you get fired?

20:43.325 --> 20:45.327
You're the best teacher in the school.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.579
[chuckles]
Which, let's face it, that's a low bar.

20:51.541 --> 20:56.338
You think maybe you can, uh, hack back
into Principal Madison's dating profile?

20:56.964 --> 20:59.341
Hmm... Which one do you want?

20:59.591 --> 21:03.345
Uh, Bumble, Tinder, UrbanSwipe.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.973
[chuckles]
She's on everything but FarmersOnly.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.849
Oh, wait, she's on that one too.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.522
-Yeah, girl is rocking that cowboy hat!
-Huh.

21:17.651 --> 21:18.735
I'm going with...

21:19.194 --> 21:20.112
Gabe!

21:20.195 --> 21:22.239
Mother-flowers!

21:24.241 --> 21:25.242
I mean, uh...

21:25.534 --> 21:27.035
Congratulations, Gabe.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.121
I just, you know...

21:29.997 --> 21:30.914
Wow.

21:32.874 --> 21:35.752
Hey, Abby, that is why
you should never try your hardest.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.632
Ooh. Yay, me. [chuckles]

21:41.300 --> 21:42.592
What's the matter, Gabe?

21:42.676 --> 21:43.635
You won!

21:43.719 --> 21:45.971
I figured right now
you'd be doing your touchdown dance.

21:46.221 --> 21:47.055
You know...

21:47.139 --> 21:48.932
♪ A little salsa, a little salsa ♪

21:49.016 --> 21:52.060
[humming] ♪ A little salsa ♪

21:52.144 --> 21:53.645
You know, like a dab or two?

21:54.187 --> 21:55.022
Come on.

21:55.605 --> 21:56.523
Do your thing.

21:58.191 --> 22:00.444
[both chuckle]

22:01.236 --> 22:03.322
You know, I've been thinking...

22:03.905 --> 22:06.366
instead of giving me
the teach-approved kids,

22:06.575 --> 22:08.660
I don't know,
why don't you give me the kids

22:08.744 --> 22:11.163
that got the "counseled out" letter
from Hernandez?

22:11.288 --> 22:12.998
You know, the world's worst pen pal?

22:14.791 --> 22:15.709
[chuckles] Okay...

22:17.627 --> 22:19.921
Carlos, can you come in here a sec?

22:21.214 --> 22:25.761
[in dramatic tone]
Locust, boils, darkness... Hernandez!

22:26.928 --> 22:28.221
[in normal voice]
Hey! We're just talking about you.

22:30.140 --> 22:33.268
Carlos, Gabe has volunteered to teach
the kids we've counseled out.

22:34.311 --> 22:37.647
-Marisol Fuentes is my best student.
-Her attendance is unacceptable.

22:37.939 --> 22:41.485
She works. She has a real job.
You should try it!

22:43.612 --> 22:46.573
We're just putting every student
in a position to succeed.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.992
Look, so many people
have turned their backs on these kids,

22:49.076 --> 22:50.702
and I don't want to be
one of those people.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.621
[chuckles]
We're not turning our backs on them.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.373
It's turning our faces
to the good students.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.293
Look, Hernandez may think
that these kids are invisible,

22:58.377 --> 23:00.420
but I see them. All of them.

23:00.921 --> 23:01.755
[Carlos] It's done.

23:01.838 --> 23:02.798
Hold on, Carlos.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.216
Yeah, hold on, Carlos.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.428
"Invisible," you say, Gabe?

23:08.970 --> 23:09.805
Did I?

23:10.055 --> 23:11.014
You know...

23:11.515 --> 23:15.143
a woman gets to a certain age,
and she sure knows what that feels like.

23:16.186 --> 23:18.438
People of color know what that feels like.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.232
-Preach, sister.
-Shut up, Carlos.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.029
You know, it's the damnedest thing.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.824
I got a message on my dating app
a little while ago

23:28.907 --> 23:31.326
from this fine-looking, young Denzel-type

23:31.535 --> 23:33.286
who wants to buy me an appletini.

23:34.204 --> 23:36.540
Denzel? Is that even your type?

23:37.124 --> 23:39.960
[chuckles] I'm alive, aren't I? Mm...

23:41.503 --> 23:45.006
He even quoted Invisible Man.
That's my favorite novel.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.217
You know, I've been meaning to read it.

23:48.885 --> 23:52.931
"I am invisible
simply because people refuse to see me."

23:53.223 --> 23:55.267
Wow, sounds like a real catch.

23:56.810 --> 24:01.148
And then, you come in here,
and you refer to these kids as invisible.

24:01.565 --> 24:03.108
That's quite a coincidence.

24:03.483 --> 24:04.943
Or maybe it's a sign.

24:06.111 --> 24:09.072
You know, if we don't see these kids now, 
no one ever will.

24:10.615 --> 24:13.118
[sighs] All right, Gabriel.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.120
You got this summer to turn 'em around.

24:15.745 --> 24:19.374
Grades, discipline, attendance.
No screw-ups.

24:19.749 --> 24:22.461
So, Gabe has to waste his summer
teaching the drip tray,

24:22.544 --> 24:25.255
and then I get to kick them out.
I can live with that.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.508
Well, you live with yourself.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.304
You can live with anything.

24:36.266 --> 24:37.851
We can't save them all, Gabe.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.645
I know,
but who are we if we don't even try?

24:41.938 --> 24:43.440
[chuckles] Ooh!

24:44.065 --> 24:45.525
He is fine!

24:47.903 --> 24:50.489
Wait a second, this is Denzel.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.117
This is a picture from The Pelican Brief.

24:54.201 --> 24:58.038
Somebody photoshopped a cowboy hat
on his damn head. Gabe!

25:02.459 --> 25:03.585
Okay.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.630
Some of you are here
because of your poor grades,

25:06.796 --> 25:07.756
poor attendance,

25:08.131 --> 25:10.675
disciplinary reasons, or all of the above.

25:11.092 --> 25:13.386
Messed around and got a triple-double.

25:17.057 --> 25:20.435
Yup. [sighs]
I gotta say, it was a good day. [chuckles]

25:20.977 --> 25:24.231
All right, so I got some good news,
and I have some bad news.

25:24.314 --> 25:27.567
The good news is
no one is getting counseled out.

25:27.651 --> 25:28.860
-[students sigh]
-[boy] Yes!

25:28.944 --> 25:31.613
Yeah, the bad news is...
we're gonna have to do summer school.

25:31.696 --> 25:32.989
[students groan]

25:33.281 --> 25:35.242
Wait, those are both bad things!

25:38.495 --> 25:41.414
I don't know,
now I've got something to do this summer.

25:42.290 --> 25:45.126
Yeah, I got something to do
this summer too, and it's not school.

25:46.169 --> 25:49.214
[in high-pitched voice]
"Yay, Mr. Iglesias saved the day!

25:50.757 --> 25:53.009
We love him and his hat!"

25:55.387 --> 25:57.847
-[sighs]
-What about your trip?

25:58.014 --> 25:58.932
Eh...

25:59.558 --> 26:02.227
[in normal voice] Who wants to roll around
in a cool Volkswagen bus,

26:02.310 --> 26:05.355
listening to '90s jams
and going to wrestling events?

26:07.148 --> 26:08.149
I'm gonna guess you?

26:08.692 --> 26:09.526
Yeah.

26:09.609 --> 26:11.069
-Yeah.
-[clicks tongue]

26:11.653 --> 26:13.196
Maybe I didn't think this through.

26:15.949 --> 26:18.285
Whoo! Rookie of the Year!

26:18.368 --> 26:20.328
-[cheers]
-[Gabe] That's right.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.080
As it turns out, it's a real award.

26:23.623 --> 26:24.791
[gasps]

26:25.250 --> 26:27.168
It's got your name engraved on it
and everything.

26:27.252 --> 26:30.046
-Aw! You guys are the best!
-Mm-hmm.

26:30.130 --> 26:33.341
Oh! There's only two Bs in Abby. Heh.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.219
Bro, you had one job.

26:38.555 --> 26:41.766
Ah, thank you.
I see you got my text, Katie.

26:41.850 --> 26:42.767
Your appletini

26:42.851 --> 26:45.395
-and your back-up appletini.
-Mm-hmm! [chuckles]

26:45.812 --> 26:48.481
How about you, Gabe?
The usual, ginger ale on the rocks?

26:48.565 --> 26:50.692
Yes, can I also have a lime in it?
I ain't driving.

26:50.775 --> 26:51.693
Ooh!

26:52.902 --> 26:54.154
Not to pry, Gabe,

26:54.237 --> 26:56.489
but is there
a specific reason you don't drink?

26:56.865 --> 26:59.576
Well, if we're being honest,
I kind of like remembering what I did

26:59.659 --> 27:01.244
and who I did it with.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.496
Well, that's why I drink.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.124
I like to forget what I did
and who I did it with.

27:07.334 --> 27:08.376
Don't worry.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.420
Eventually, you'll forget it all.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.590
Only the grinding hip pain will remain.

27:15.258 --> 27:16.843
Bone on bone.

27:18.428 --> 27:20.889
Hey. Here's to the future, huh?

27:20.972 --> 27:24.392
-[laughing and chattering]
-Whoo!

27:24.476 --> 27:26.519
-Whoo! Bone on bone.
-[Paula] Mm!

27:28.438 --> 27:29.648
All right, Paula.

27:29.731 --> 27:32.400
-Who is the new honors teacher?
-Oh!

27:33.860 --> 27:35.945
I'm going to go with...

27:36.029 --> 27:37.197
you, Tony!

27:37.280 --> 27:39.449
Oh, suck a dictionary!

27:42.452 --> 27:45.038
You know, somebody better teach
this young gal how to swear,

27:45.121 --> 27:47.207
or she's gonna get laughed out
of Long Beach.

27:47.290 --> 27:48.291
[Abby sighs]

27:48.375 --> 27:51.127
I'm sorry, I'm just not a very good loser.
[chuckles]

27:51.211 --> 27:52.712
-No practice.
-[Ray] Mm-hmm.

27:53.755 --> 27:56.633
Abby, you can bring the kids
up to your level.

27:56.841 --> 28:00.553
I'm hoping the honors kids
can bring Tony up to their level.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.139
Well, thank you, Paula.

28:03.848 --> 28:06.309
So, what kind of raise are
we talking about here?

28:06.643 --> 28:08.395
I'm not gonna fire you.

28:09.979 --> 28:12.023
-I do it for the kids.
-Mm-hmm!

28:12.107 --> 28:15.235
[laughs]
To surviving another school year!

28:15.318 --> 28:16.861
-Whoo, yay!
