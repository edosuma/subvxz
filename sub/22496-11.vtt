- and it had a patio, but it

the mythology, man.

07:11.296 --> 07:14.784

Belle from "Beauty and the Beast"
but a dick slut.

09:08.987 --> 09:11.555
Is that a sex thing?!
Have you guys had sex?

09:11.557 --> 09:13.890
No ...
Just dry humping and ball play.

09:13.892 --> 09:17.060
- Ball play?! Ugh!
- You must stay away from

09:17.062 --> 09:19.095
Shredder, April.
He is dangerous.

What should I do, Mr. Rat King?
I belong with Shredder.

And my idea involves you taking
