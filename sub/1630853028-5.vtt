WEBVTT

00:10.928 --> 00:12.847
What?

00:12.930 --> 00:15.474
What is... Hey, hey, hey.

00:15.558 --> 00:17.977
Ingrid, what is that?

00:19.478 --> 00:22.606
Hey. Hey.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.443
Sonia's
first taste of chocolate,

00:25.526 --> 00:28.362
and she absolutely loves it.

00:28.446 --> 00:30.406
- Talk about a stiff upper lip.

00:30.489 --> 00:31.615
- She's just go...

00:31.699 --> 00:34.410
Hello?

00:34.493 --> 00:35.536
Oh, God.

00:35.619 --> 00:39.123
Well, I'll go check it out.

00:42.418 --> 00:44.962
Head to the nearest exit!

00:47.548 --> 00:48.632
What is happening?

00:48.716 --> 00:50.301
Oh, it's just a new, uh,
security system.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.635
You know, 'cause of the,
uh, Ludd attacks.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.137
- Save yourselves!
- Yeah, and, um,

00:53.220 --> 00:54.930
you're kind of
a-a night owl, huh?

00:55.014 --> 00:56.640
- Me, too.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.350
Everything's under control.

00:58.434 --> 00:59.602
Force quit, force quit.

00:59.685 --> 01:00.853
- Looks like it.
- Shelter in place!

01:00.936 --> 01:02.313
Do not panic!

01:02.396 --> 01:03.606
- Shelter in place!
- Stop. Stop it.

01:03.689 --> 01:04.940
- Good night.
- Night.
- Do not panic!

01:05.024 --> 01:07.193
- Uh...
- Okay, everybody panic!

01:07.276 --> 01:09.069
- Everybody panic!
- Um, why are you saying
to panic?

01:09.153 --> 01:10.446
- What? Stop.
- Everybody panic!

01:18.746 --> 01:21.207
Why are you so sure

01:21.290 --> 01:22.625
you can trust Pastor Rob?

01:22.708 --> 01:25.628
Because we have the same enemy.

01:25.711 --> 01:28.506
Who, uploads?
They're somebody's grandma.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.508
- All right?
- Baby, we need
a new system, right?

01:30.591 --> 01:32.426
The Ludds have been working
on it for a long time.

01:32.510 --> 01:33.844
- We got this.
- Yeah.

01:33.928 --> 01:36.347
You know, Nathan knew
what he was doing with Beyond.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.098
Your upload should be run
by your family,

01:38.182 --> 01:39.600
'cause who else can you trust?

01:39.683 --> 01:41.227
- Ah.
- See,
that's a wonderful idea.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.604
Stick Grandma up in the attic
by herself.

01:43.687 --> 01:44.980
Nice.

01:45.064 --> 01:46.148
She can use Lakeview.

01:46.232 --> 01:48.901
Like a park
or a community center.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.986
I wish more people saw
the world like you do.

01:51.070 --> 01:52.738
But I think we both know,

01:52.822 --> 01:55.324
Lakeview has to be
destroyed, Nora.

01:56.367 --> 01:58.702
No, we both don't know.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.707
You're real bossy
for an anarchist.

02:03.791 --> 02:08.003
Snap.

02:08.087 --> 02:10.256
Maybe we need
some space tonight.

02:10.339 --> 02:11.715
Okay.

02:11.799 --> 02:15.010
I mean, all right.

02:15.094 --> 02:16.846
Here.

02:16.929 --> 02:18.264
Oh.

02:18.347 --> 02:20.933
No, I thought,
I thought you were gonna...

02:21.016 --> 02:22.017
Oh, that pillow's for me?

02:22.101 --> 02:24.728
Yeah.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.355
It's for you
to sleep in the hall.

02:28.774 --> 02:30.025
Sweet dreams.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.328
Please, Matteo,
come back!

02:41.412 --> 02:42.746
- Don't be angry.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.248
I knew it.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.916
Ivan, I didn't fuck your mop!

02:47.251 --> 02:49.003
It's like
I always say,

02:49.086 --> 02:52.256
if you're fighting more than
you're fucking, cut him loose.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.884
Okay, wait, I-I thought
you always say,

02:54.967 --> 02:58.262
"This red wine
is making me sexy."

02:58.345 --> 03:00.389
I say lots of things.

03:00.472 --> 03:03.726
don't dump a live dude
for a dead ex-boy toy

03:03.809 --> 03:05.644
who almost got you killed.

03:05.728 --> 03:09.273
Look, I'm not
dumping Matteo, all right?

03:09.356 --> 03:12.026
And I'm not getting with Nathan.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.527
Look, we're just friends.

03:15.696 --> 03:19.617
But speaking
of who murdered him...

03:19.700 --> 03:22.786
Oh, no, here she goes.
Lord, give me the patience.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.414
Nathan thinks the Ludds
are behind it,

03:25.497 --> 03:29.418
but Matteo thinks
it could be Horizen.

03:30.794 --> 03:33.964
Do you think Horizen
could be capable of murder?

03:34.048 --> 03:38.552
No. Horizen's motto is
"Don't Be Evil. Obviously."

03:38.636 --> 03:42.514
Unless it's "Don't Be Evil
Obviously,"

03:42.598 --> 03:47.603
like, don't be obvious
when you are being evil.

03:49.104 --> 03:52.775
Damn, that's crafty.

03:55.361 --> 03:57.988
What are you doing
with that sausage, pal?

04:02.201 --> 04:04.203
- Are you okay, bud?

04:04.286 --> 04:05.704
What was that?

04:05.788 --> 04:07.498
The AI guys screaming
trigger you or something?

04:07.581 --> 04:08.749
You're a little jumpy.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.626
I haven't slept in three days.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.462
I'm being watched.

04:13.545 --> 04:15.589
Oh, boy. Okay.

04:15.673 --> 04:18.759
Look, dude, there are
millions of uploads, okay?

04:18.842 --> 04:21.720
They don't have the manpower
to watch us all the time.

04:21.804 --> 04:22.930
You're fine.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.015
I've been on point patrol
in Iran.

04:25.099 --> 04:26.433
You can feel the eyes.

04:26.517 --> 04:29.687
As soon as I fall asleep,
they peek inside my head.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.438
- Angel!
- He... We're fine.

04:31.522 --> 04:34.566
- We're fine.
- I already told you,

04:34.650 --> 04:35.818
I do not know
when they are bringing back

04:35.901 --> 04:37.027
Cheddar Bog Biscuits.

04:37.111 --> 04:38.696
It's not about that.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.280
Although I do miss them.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.366
Mmm.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.742
Hey! I'm onto you.

04:43.826 --> 04:46.620
- Excuse me?
- Oh, ever since
the Ludd attack,

04:46.704 --> 04:48.497
you've been spying on us
nonstop.

04:48.580 --> 04:51.291
And you are stealing my dreams.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.293
Not literally, obviously.

04:53.377 --> 04:55.921
I can literally feel them
being pulled out of my head.

04:56.005 --> 04:57.381
You're crazy.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.883
Oh, am I crazy?
I'm crazy?

04:59.967 --> 05:02.011
Well, if I'm crazy,
then you're glue,

05:02.094 --> 05:04.513
and what I say sticks on you.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.223
See? He's fine.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.474
- Get your boy.
- I know.

05:07.558 --> 05:09.309
- I know.

05:09.393 --> 05:10.686
It's fine, it's fine.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.104
It's fine.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.399
I want to sign up for one
of these digital babies.

05:15.482 --> 05:18.235
Okay. Do you have
Mr. Brown's consent?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.154
Consent?

05:20.237 --> 05:22.948
I have his
motherfucking blessing.

05:23.032 --> 05:27.786
And same with my kind of,
sort of mother-in-law.

05:27.870 --> 05:30.330
And your family?

05:30.414 --> 05:32.374
My family is less family

05:32.458 --> 05:35.085
and more pack of hyenas
on a carcass.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.880
With my feelings
being the carcass.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.257
I see. Well,
there are different levels

05:40.340 --> 05:41.508
of digital baby.

05:41.592 --> 05:43.927
You need to start
with an AI simulation.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.721
Okay, is that the highest level?

05:45.804 --> 05:47.139
No.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.724
The highest level,

05:48.807 --> 05:50.517
which is also
the most expensive,

05:50.601 --> 05:53.729
is we merge information
from both of your brain scans

05:53.812 --> 05:56.648
to create a brand-new
human identity.

05:56.732 --> 05:59.193
Okay, I want one of those. Stat.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.528
Well, you can't
skip levels, though.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.698
I only skip levels.

06:04.782 --> 06:07.409
Patience, my dear.

06:07.493 --> 06:11.663
Okay, give me one of these
real fake babies or I'll scream.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.123
Will you?

06:25.260 --> 06:27.679
Oh, shit.

06:29.223 --> 06:32.142
I'm here. I'm here.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.813
Until now,
we've had to follow

06:35.896 --> 06:40.400
strict privacy guidelines to
protect the upload experience.

06:40.484 --> 06:44.154
The government recently let us
relax those standards,

06:44.238 --> 06:46.740
after the horrible,
devastating--

06:46.824 --> 06:49.076
not really-- Ludd attack.

06:49.159 --> 06:53.622
It's okay to clap.
To relaxing the standards.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.167
Ah!

06:57.251 --> 06:58.961
What does this mean?

06:59.044 --> 07:00.504
For one thing, we are now
allowed to screengrab

07:00.587 --> 07:01.797
without permission.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.257
Yes!

07:03.340 --> 07:05.008
And we have new software
that will,

07:05.092 --> 07:07.052
in a few days,
for the first time,

07:07.136 --> 07:10.681
give us searchable access
to uploads' thoughts

07:10.764 --> 07:13.851
in real time as they think them.

07:13.934 --> 07:18.689
Introducing... MindFrisk!

07:20.399 --> 07:22.526
Any thoughts of interest

07:22.609 --> 07:24.444
that compromise
Lakeview security

07:24.528 --> 07:26.989
can now be flagged
for further investigation.

07:30.701 --> 07:32.828
And the frisking
is happening now.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.080
And it's extracting a thought.

07:35.164 --> 07:36.623
Okay, let's see.

07:36.707 --> 07:39.126
A little bigger.

07:39.209 --> 07:42.671
That's better. A little more.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.756
Perfect.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.092
Just a little more.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.679
Okay.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.890
Four grand? Fuck you.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.062
Our old spot?

08:07.779 --> 08:09.156
Hi.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.116
Hi.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.577
Uh, Horizen's about to start
listening to uploads' thoughts.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.120
Wait, what?
I thought they couldn't do that.

08:15.204 --> 08:18.248
Yeah, they're using that lame
Ludd attack as an excuse.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.000
- Lame?
- Mm.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.711
That's an interesting thing
to say.

08:22.794 --> 08:26.006
How are things with you
and, um, Matte-Matteo, is it?

08:26.089 --> 08:27.466
- Fine.
- Mm-hmm.

08:27.549 --> 08:28.967
- They're fine.
- Mm-hmm.

08:29.051 --> 08:30.719
We're just keeping
the professional stuff

08:30.802 --> 08:31.970
separate from the personal.

08:32.054 --> 08:33.513
Of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.098
- For sure.
- Look, the point is,

08:35.182 --> 08:36.767
Kannerman was here
during Family Day.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.602
Not to see Ingrid, though.

08:38.685 --> 08:41.396
Which is why I think he was here
meeting someone else.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.564
And if it was
the Horizen execs...

08:42.648 --> 08:43.690
Oh, fuck.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.400
If Horizen has a deal
with Kannerman,

08:45.484 --> 08:47.277
and he can hear my thoughts...

08:47.361 --> 08:48.862
I'm scared.

08:48.946 --> 08:51.073
Once they turn on MindFrisk,
you'll be flagged.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.033
Well, I don't want to get
mysteriously deleted.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.493
When does MindFrisk go online?

08:54.576 --> 08:56.036
Soon.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.454
My new boss wrote the program,

08:57.537 --> 08:58.747
so I'm gonna sneak
into his office

08:58.830 --> 09:00.207
after work
and I'll check it out.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.291
Okay, I want to go with you.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.626
What about Ingrid?

09:02.709 --> 09:04.962
Uh, she said she needed
some "me time"

09:05.045 --> 09:06.129
to work on our relationship
tonight.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.881
By herself?

09:07.965 --> 09:09.841
Yeah.

09:09.925 --> 09:12.344
O... kay.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.513
Uh, my boss goes home
at 8:00 p.m.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.598
Okay, your 8:00 p.m.
or my 8:00 p.m.?

09:16.682 --> 09:17.933
I think they're the same.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.434
What time you got right now?

09:19.518 --> 09:21.144
3:00 p.m.?

09:21.228 --> 09:23.522
Weird, mine says 3:01.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.857
- Oh, mine says 3:01 now, too.
- Yeah.

09:25.941 --> 09:28.402
- So, our 8:00 p.m.
- Our 8:00 p.m.

09:31.113 --> 09:32.406
Are you gonna go, or...

09:32.489 --> 09:34.074
Uh, yeah, sure. Sure.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.242
Okay.

09:37.286 --> 09:38.954
I'm not, I'm not even
this way, so...

09:39.037 --> 09:40.414
Okay.

09:40.497 --> 09:43.417
I'm gonna...

09:43.500 --> 09:45.711
I'm gonna stay here. You go.

09:54.553 --> 09:57.639
Wild, right? MindFrisk.

09:57.723 --> 09:58.849
I love this company.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.726
It's so cutting-edge.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.520
- One of my clients,
a real idiot...
- Uh-huh.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.815
...thought that we were
somehow taking his dreams.

10:06.898 --> 10:09.693
We haven't started
doing that now, have we?

10:09.776 --> 10:12.112
Oh, yeah, we have.
And now, with the new law,

10:12.195 --> 10:16.825
Horizen can sell upload brain
recordings for entertainment.

10:16.908 --> 10:19.578
So, like an action dream,
now we can sell it to--

10:19.661 --> 10:22.164
you're gonna die-- Hollywood.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.124
And the weirder, edgier stuff
we can just post

10:24.207 --> 10:25.792
directly online, unedited.

10:25.876 --> 10:29.421
I mean, it is totally amateur,
but it's addictively bingeable.

10:29.504 --> 10:34.801
And the best part is that
it's all Horizen I.P., so...

10:34.885 --> 10:36.011
cha-ching.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.347
That's insane.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.639
Oh, which part?

10:39.723 --> 10:41.641
Uh, um,

10:41.725 --> 10:46.104
that this client
is never right about anything.

10:46.188 --> 10:48.690
Oh, well, he's definitely right
about this.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.245
Oh, my God.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.081
You're still here?

11:04.164 --> 11:06.208
Look, do you want
the baby or not?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.547
Congrats, Mommy.

11:12.631 --> 11:13.590
Oh...

11:15.467 --> 11:17.469
Is it a boy?

11:17.552 --> 11:19.221
It appears to be,

11:19.304 --> 11:21.306
though they'll decide
for themselves, of course.

11:21.390 --> 11:24.434
Well...

11:24.518 --> 11:26.103
good luck.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.481
- Oh.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.236
I'm so happy.

12:02.431 --> 12:04.808
Get out of my head!

12:04.891 --> 12:07.936
That is a long zipper.

12:08.019 --> 12:09.729
Hey!
You need to put Luke to sleep

12:09.813 --> 12:11.231
before he crashes or worse.

12:11.314 --> 12:12.649
What's worse?

12:12.732 --> 12:14.276
Uploads' memories defrag
while they sleep.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.153
If he goes too long,
he'll have a system failure.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.696
So you got to sing
that hunk a lullaby...

12:17.779 --> 12:19.322
- ...chop-chop.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.786
Luke, you get on my nerves.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.165
Where are you?

12:34.921 --> 12:36.631
There you go.

12:37.883 --> 12:40.093
I don't consent to this.
Whose side are you on?

12:40.177 --> 12:42.429
The side that pays
my health insurance.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.348
- Now come on. Nighty night.
- No.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.976
You of all people
do not want me to dream more.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.228
This is for your own good.

12:50.312 --> 12:51.354
No.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.398
Oh, my...

12:57.194 --> 12:58.653
- Damn.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.741
Well, that just woke me up!

13:04.284 --> 13:07.287
No beddy-bye for me!

13:11.917 --> 13:13.960
This is a mother's job, right?

13:14.044 --> 13:16.463
To stop this noise?

13:16.546 --> 13:18.381
It gets easier
as they get older.

13:18.465 --> 13:21.384
And remember,
you always have help.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.470
Oh. Thank you, Grandma.

13:23.553 --> 13:24.721
Ew, stop. No.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.181
Not me. Help.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.141
Let one of the angels
bring him around noon

13:28.225 --> 13:30.018
to say a brief hello.

13:30.101 --> 13:31.978
Oh.

13:32.062 --> 13:35.106
99 cents to give him a nap.

13:35.190 --> 13:37.359
Hmm. That's cheaper than Valium.

13:43.365 --> 13:45.867
Hallelujah.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.913
Wow, that went by fast.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.290
- Kids are a money pit.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.585
Okay.

13:55.669 --> 13:58.797
- God.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.482
- Hey.
- Shh.

14:17.566 --> 14:19.276
Hey, I'm in his office.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.194
Sweet.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.196
His computer is locked
with a biometric.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.739
Okay, what kind?

14:24.823 --> 14:26.408
I saw him lick something.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.034
Okay, gross. It's his DNA.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.578
Um, look for a dongle.

14:30.579 --> 14:31.913
Okay.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.248
Do you have a black light app?

14:33.331 --> 14:34.708
What's that gonna do?

14:34.791 --> 14:36.126
Uh, men excrete a lot of DNA,

14:36.209 --> 14:38.670
and we're gonna find
some of his.

14:41.339 --> 14:42.549
Okay.

14:45.677 --> 14:49.306
Never wanted to find anything
I desperately needed less.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.932
Well, it gets worse.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.892
Check the trash for tissues.

14:52.976 --> 14:55.103
Okay, I really hate you
right now.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.646
I know.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.982
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Don't do that.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.901
Check the back of his chair,
like, where it hits his hair.

15:05.989 --> 15:09.034
Thanks for never showering,
Craig.

15:11.119 --> 15:14.414
- We're in.
- Okay.
Search the root directory.

15:16.207 --> 15:17.917
MindFrisk is stored

15:18.001 --> 15:20.462
in a folder called
Virtual Worlds...

15:20.545 --> 15:22.422
in a subfolder...

15:22.505 --> 15:23.923
called Mordor.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.216
Ew.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.468
He keeps it in VR?

15:26.551 --> 15:28.053
I don't like the sound of that.

15:28.136 --> 15:29.638
Me either.

15:29.721 --> 15:32.390
Okay, what kind
of perverted fever dream

15:32.474 --> 15:34.851
am I about to step into?

15:36.019 --> 15:37.687
Hang on.

15:40.565 --> 15:42.484
Nora, what do you see?

15:42.567 --> 15:44.944
I can't believe it.

15:45.028 --> 15:48.948
His VR office is exactly
the same as his real one.

15:49.032 --> 15:52.702
Hold up. Not exactly the same.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.999
What a little shit.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.127
Wait.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.588
I'm in Lakeview.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.135
Aleesha!

16:09.219 --> 16:12.097
- Thank you for your service.
- What did you say?

16:12.180 --> 16:14.432
Ain't you that Army nurse
that's all over DreamHub?

16:15.850 --> 16:17.102
Ooh, baby,

16:17.185 --> 16:19.479
I'm reporting
for sexually active duty.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.190
Now, show me what you got
under that Henley shirt.

16:22.273 --> 16:23.692
Luke!

16:23.775 --> 16:26.945
Lucy, I'm on motherfucking
DreamHub in Luke's dreams,

16:27.028 --> 16:28.947
and now people are
recognizing me on the street.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.990
I am not trying to be
one of those people

16:31.074 --> 16:32.992
that can't go out
in sweatpants and no eyeliner.

16:33.076 --> 16:36.913
- Luke is dreaming about you?
- Yes, crazy, nasty sex dreams.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.082
This is so violating.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.627
- What is that?
- Nothing.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.754
Stop searching it.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.965
Relax, skinny.
We'll blur your face out

16:47.048 --> 16:49.134
of future dreams--
if there even are any.

16:49.217 --> 16:52.429
That playa will die
from lack of sleep by tomorrow.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.557
- Ooh, he is quite
the drill sergeant.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.642
- Bye.
- Lu...

17:07.193 --> 17:09.195
Hey.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.364
Look what I found.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.411
They knew you were working
on a free upload.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.246
Anything else about me?

17:18.329 --> 17:19.539
No.

17:19.622 --> 17:22.876
Just that you were considering
bicep inflation.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.005
Wha... What?

17:27.088 --> 17:29.174
That is so...
that's so ridiculous.

17:29.257 --> 17:30.800
Dylan must have got into my...

17:30.884 --> 17:32.469
Hey, open MindFrisk.

17:40.852 --> 17:42.020
Wow.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.897
That's really cool.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.191
I mean, it's creepy as shit,
but...

17:46.274 --> 17:49.944
from a programming perspective,
that's really cool.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.530
Uh, what kind of search terms
can you put in?

17:52.614 --> 17:54.199
Uh...

17:56.075 --> 17:59.037
You can search thoughts by word,

17:59.120 --> 18:00.747
extreme emotional state,

18:00.830 --> 18:04.083
violent language,
anti-capitalist language,

18:04.167 --> 18:07.378
and... listen in
on any specific upload.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.130
Mm. Do me, do me, do me.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.799
Oh. I am.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.689
- Stop!
- Wow.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.316
Wow.

18:28.399 --> 18:31.236
- That's amazing.
- Horrifying.

18:31.319 --> 18:33.696
- Horrifying.
- Horrifying.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.949
- Mm.
- Wow.

18:36.032 --> 18:38.034
Mama.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.661
Mama!

18:41.037 --> 18:44.833
Hi. Look at you.

18:44.916 --> 18:47.252
Here I come.

18:47.335 --> 18:50.255
Okay. Hi.

18:50.338 --> 18:51.923
Hey, baby.

18:52.006 --> 18:53.508
Hey, look at me.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.051
You want to play peekaboo?

18:55.134 --> 18:56.219
Peekaboo!

18:56.302 --> 18:58.638
Again!

18:58.721 --> 19:00.473
Ready? Peekaboo!

19:00.557 --> 19:01.850
- Again!
- Again?

19:01.933 --> 19:03.017
Okay.

19:03.101 --> 19:05.311
- Peekaboo!
- Again!

19:05.395 --> 19:06.980
Okay, we'll do...
we'll do it one more time.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.231
Okay? L-Last time.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.440
Ready?

19:09.524 --> 19:10.608
Peekaboo!

19:10.692 --> 19:12.527
- Again!

19:12.610 --> 19:14.320
Why don't we play
something else, okay?

19:14.404 --> 19:16.197
Come here, come here, come here.

19:16.281 --> 19:18.199
- Come here, come here,
come here. Come here.

19:18.283 --> 19:19.325
Ah! Oh, my gosh!

19:19.409 --> 19:21.160
Ooh, he's so heavy. Oh.

19:21.244 --> 19:23.329
How old are you? Wow.

19:23.413 --> 19:24.789
Oh, gee!

19:24.873 --> 19:26.875
Okay...

19:26.958 --> 19:28.668
I think you're kind of cranky.

19:28.751 --> 19:30.962
Sleep function!

19:33.381 --> 19:35.008
Mommy!

19:35.091 --> 19:37.719
- Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

19:37.802 --> 19:39.470
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

19:40.471 --> 19:41.931
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

19:42.974 --> 19:45.059
- Oh, my gosh.
- Where's my daddy?

19:45.143 --> 19:47.228
Or my other mommy?

19:47.312 --> 19:49.856
Um, I sent him away, sweetie.

19:49.939 --> 19:52.317
'Cause I wanted to spend
some time alone with you.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.445
So I could get really good
at this mom stuff.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.446
Well...

19:56.529 --> 19:58.114
you're not really good at it.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.408
Wow. That was rude.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.870
Nap time.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.292
Do you think
you can control your thoughts

20:09.375 --> 20:11.252
if you practice?

20:11.336 --> 20:14.255
Uh... I mean, I... maybe.

20:14.339 --> 20:15.256
Well, let's switch to audio

20:15.340 --> 20:16.716
instead of subtitles.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.260
Okay, wait, wait.

20:19.344 --> 20:21.763
Um... before you do that,
I'm the type of person

20:21.846 --> 20:23.222
that, like, immediately thinks

20:23.306 --> 20:24.974
the thing
they're not supposed to.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.935
You know, like: Don't think
about a pink elephant.

20:27.018 --> 20:29.395
Boom. So I'll-I'll probably
think, like, the weirdest,

20:29.479 --> 20:31.439
- worst...
- Yeah. Monkey mind, right?

20:31.522 --> 20:33.274
- Yeah.
- I get it.

20:33.358 --> 20:35.735
Okay, just avoid thinking about
Kannerman or being murdered.

20:35.818 --> 20:37.946
'Cause that's what's
gonna get you in trouble.

20:38.029 --> 20:40.365
- Okay.
- Okay?

20:43.910 --> 20:46.162
That's not the only
thing that'll get me in trouble.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.749
Okay, uh, don't think
about Kannerman.

20:49.832 --> 20:51.709
He's just Ingrid's dad.
He likes the Clippers.

20:51.793 --> 20:53.127
What's their record now?

20:53.211 --> 20:55.421
Don't think about
the most important thing.

20:55.505 --> 20:57.757
My God, look at her.
She's so beautiful.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.008
I still want to kiss her so...

21:03.763 --> 21:05.974
See? A pink elephant, so, uh...

21:06.057 --> 21:07.642
That doesn't...

21:07.725 --> 21:08.810
it doesn't,
it doesn't mean anything.

21:08.893 --> 21:09.811
Sure. Sure.

21:09.894 --> 21:12.105
Uh, yeah. I'm...

21:12.188 --> 21:13.940
I-I think we should, uh...

21:14.023 --> 21:15.566
- Let's disable this thing.
- Mm-hmm.

21:15.650 --> 21:16.776
Yeah.

21:16.859 --> 21:19.195
Wait. Before you do,

21:19.278 --> 21:21.614
put my name
in the subject field.

21:21.698 --> 21:23.032
I want to see
who's thinking about me.

21:23.116 --> 21:26.244
Hmm. There's the narcissist
I know and love... like.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.622
Know and like.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.749
Love. But okay.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.084
Like.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.508
- Huh.
- Choak?

21:40.591 --> 21:42.760
Why is Choak thinking about me?

21:42.844 --> 21:44.387
I don't know.

21:44.470 --> 21:47.473
I mean,
I'm impressed he's awake.

21:47.557 --> 21:50.601
Okay. He's paying
for the highest privacy level,

21:50.685 --> 21:52.895
so we can't hear his thoughts.

21:53.896 --> 21:56.941
But I can disable that, though.

22:01.904 --> 22:05.283
Can I trust what
this fellow says about Brown?

22:05.366 --> 22:06.743
What if he's right?

22:06.826 --> 22:08.578
Wouldn't be good for all of us.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.038
Hmm.

22:10.121 --> 22:11.748
Who's he talking to?

22:11.831 --> 22:13.624
Where is he?

22:13.708 --> 22:15.001
You sure it was him?

22:15.084 --> 22:17.003
I didn't see him.
Only heard his voice.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.713
But it'd make sense, right?

22:18.796 --> 22:21.174
She saves him,
so he saves her back.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.843
Hmm. What's his angle?

22:23.926 --> 22:27.513
- Just nod encouragingly.
- What are they talking about?
I just want to see.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.100
I thought this would be
worth something to you.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.895
Like, say,
an upgrade to Lakeview,

22:33.978 --> 22:36.439
so I can settle the score.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.441
I see.

22:38.524 --> 22:41.402
This idiot lets his target
escape, and then gets pureed

22:41.486 --> 22:44.572
in an elevator and expects
to be rewarded for it.

22:44.655 --> 22:46.657
Elevator? Nathan.

22:48.159 --> 22:49.994
Kmart Villascape is shit.

22:50.078 --> 22:52.288
That's where you put me after
everything I've done for you?

22:52.371 --> 22:54.373
We didn't expect
to have to upload you.

22:54.457 --> 22:58.377
Frankly, I'd say you were lucky
I looked after you at all.

22:58.461 --> 23:00.129
Simon, Julius.

23:01.172 --> 23:04.008
Show my visitor out, please.

23:04.092 --> 23:06.052
Hold on.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.513
What an asshole.

23:08.596 --> 23:11.557
Nathan Brown isn't a threat.

23:11.641 --> 23:13.976
He has no memories left
to tie me to anything.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.145
Oh, my God, it was Choak.
He's the one backing Kannerman.

23:16.229 --> 23:17.814
He's the one who had me killed.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.357
- But why?
- I don't know.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.399
God, he's my neighbor.

23:20.483 --> 23:21.776
He's been laughing at me
this entire time.

23:21.859 --> 23:22.777
People
shouldn't underestimate me.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.403
I need to go to memory parlor.

23:24.487 --> 23:26.572
- I need to enhance everything.
- Nathan, I know you're angry,

23:26.656 --> 23:28.699
- and you should be,
'cause this is crazy.
- I think a snack is in order.

23:28.783 --> 23:31.244
- Maybe something cheesy.
Maybe something...
- Shut the fuck up, Choak.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.497
I think we should
consider pulling your memories

23:34.580 --> 23:37.250
that we restored--
to protect you.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.252
You can't think about something
that's not there.

23:39.335 --> 23:40.962
Go back the way I was?

23:41.045 --> 23:43.339
I could hold them for you
to keep them safe.

23:44.966 --> 23:47.176
No, I can't. I...

23:47.260 --> 23:49.220
It's not that I don't trust you.

23:49.303 --> 23:50.763
Okay? I do.

23:51.806 --> 23:55.059
I think you're the only person
I do trust.

23:55.143 --> 23:57.770
- But I can't go back, okay?

23:57.854 --> 24:00.439
I-I need to be...

24:00.523 --> 24:04.235
this version... of me.

24:04.318 --> 24:05.778
You know, I-I won't go back

24:05.862 --> 24:08.614
to being
that selfish piece of shit.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.160
Okay.

24:14.495 --> 24:16.831
So we need to stop MindFrisk
before it starts.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.499
I spent years
taking bugs out of code.

24:18.583 --> 24:20.334
It'll be fun to put some in.

24:20.418 --> 24:22.253
We can't just disable it,
though.

24:22.336 --> 24:23.963
It's not enough.

24:26.424 --> 24:27.758
What?

24:27.842 --> 24:29.844
I have an idea.

24:31.637 --> 24:35.141
Something Robin Hood would do.

24:35.224 --> 24:37.310
I love Robin Hood.

24:38.352 --> 24:40.229
I know.

24:40.313 --> 24:42.481
- Let me in!

24:42.565 --> 24:44.025
- - Piss off, Mommy!

24:44.108 --> 24:45.943
Sleep function!

24:46.027 --> 24:48.237
Please! Please! Please!

24:48.321 --> 24:52.325
Please! Please! Please! Please!
Please! Please! Please!

25:11.427 --> 25:14.013
How many sex dreams
have you had about me?

25:14.096 --> 25:15.848
Oh, yeah, right. You wish.

25:17.642 --> 25:19.227
Like, one.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.562
Half of one.
Barely a full dream.

25:21.646 --> 25:23.356
They're all over DreamHub.

25:23.439 --> 25:24.815
What? Let me see.

25:27.818 --> 25:30.488
That could have been dreamt
by a lot of people.

25:30.571 --> 25:32.698
Luke, do I seem
like a stupid person?

25:32.782 --> 25:34.659
Just because you're
a stupid person

25:34.742 --> 25:36.661
doesn't mean
I'm a stupid person.

25:36.744 --> 25:38.496
So what if I dream about you?

25:38.579 --> 25:40.373
I see you every day.

25:40.456 --> 25:42.250
Who else am I gonna dream about?
Oh, what?

25:42.333 --> 25:43.876
What, is that harassment? Huh?

25:43.960 --> 25:45.586
You gonna kick me
off the system?

25:45.670 --> 25:49.590
No. But maybe you can make my
life a little easier for once

25:49.674 --> 25:52.843
and get in the bed
so I can put you to sleep.

25:52.927 --> 25:54.428
So you can put me to sleep,

25:54.512 --> 25:57.640
or so you can see
how the dream ends?

26:00.851 --> 26:03.354
Why don't we get in the bed
together,

26:03.437 --> 26:06.148
see where it goes?

26:06.232 --> 26:08.067
Seriously?

26:08.150 --> 26:09.110
Mm-hmm.

26:09.193 --> 26:10.987
If you're gonna dream about me

26:11.070 --> 26:12.822
and people are gonna see it,

26:12.905 --> 26:14.573
let's make it good.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.559
So, we're...

26:46.772 --> 26:48.566
Gotcha.

26:57.366 --> 27:00.077
- Salty. Creamy.

27:00.161 --> 27:01.329
Hot and cheesy.

27:01.412 --> 27:03.372
Get 'em
while they're hot.

27:03.456 --> 27:04.915
Shit!

27:09.462 --> 27:11.088
Mama?

27:11.172 --> 27:13.174
Mama?

27:15.718 --> 27:17.219
Mama?

27:17.303 --> 27:18.971
No.

27:19.055 --> 27:20.181
No, no, no, no, no, no.

27:20.264 --> 27:21.891
Rewind.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.642
Rewind, please.

27:23.726 --> 27:25.644
Why is there no rewind function?

27:25.728 --> 27:28.898
I'll pay extra... Come on.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.399
It's all right, Mother.

27:30.483 --> 27:33.527
You paid for my whole life,

27:33.611 --> 27:35.780
and I thank you.

27:35.863 --> 27:38.199
- No.
- Mother,

27:38.282 --> 27:41.035
may I ask you for something?

27:41.118 --> 27:42.912
That's free.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.289
Anything.

27:45.373 --> 27:47.041
Could you...

27:47.124 --> 27:48.918
give me a name?

27:49.001 --> 27:50.252
No, uh...

27:50.336 --> 27:52.630
Noah.

27:52.713 --> 27:54.632
I love it.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.554
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

28:13.150 --> 28:15.152
Slow down. Zoom in.

28:19.407 --> 28:20.950
Oh, my God.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.576
Enhance audio.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.870
Shit. Come on. Fuck.

28:24.954 --> 28:26.455
That kid
might have seen me.

28:26.539 --> 28:28.165
Oh,
I don't think so.

28:28.249 --> 28:29.458
Don't risk it.

28:29.542 --> 28:31.210
Get rid of him.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.465
Call Nora.

28:39.844 --> 28:42.388
God, I really don't want
to say this on the phone.

28:43.722 --> 28:47.685
I wanted so badly to say it back
to you that day, Nora.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.397
I love you, too.

28:53.524 --> 28:54.942
You're smart.

28:55.025 --> 28:57.111
You're funny.

28:57.194 --> 28:58.362
You're beautiful.

28:58.446 --> 28:59.572
You...

28:59.655 --> 29:01.740
you always see the best
in people.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.079
I didn't deserve
someone like that.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.082
I still don't.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.058
Okay.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.604
Ugh.

29:31.687 --> 29:34.148
Another $10 million
for pre-K education programs

29:34.231 --> 29:35.983
down the drain.

29:50.289 --> 29:53.584
Why's that tart staring at me?

29:53.667 --> 29:55.336
And that one.

29:55.419 --> 29:59.340
The impudence
of these peasants here.

29:59.423 --> 30:01.217
Look at these wretched fools.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.843
Stop it!

30:02.927 --> 30:04.637
What in God's green earth...

30:04.720 --> 30:05.804
Munthers!

30:06.805 --> 30:09.850
Munthers! Get me Craig Munthers!

30:11.143 --> 30:13.229
Munthers! It's his fault.

30:13.312 --> 30:14.563
How dare he!

30:14.647 --> 30:16.482
Where's the little fucker?
I'll kill him!

30:16.565 --> 30:18.442
Somebody get me Craig Munthers.
