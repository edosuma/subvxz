00:08.950 --> 00:11.868
You ever hear of a thing
called the yurei?

00:11.946 --> 00:14.705
Can a yurei
control other people?

00:14.782 --> 00:16.224
You know
it's not real, right?

00:16.300 --> 00:17.758
My daughter, Amy,

00:17.835 --> 00:21.020
would like to offer her
secretarial services.

00:21.097 --> 00:23.472
Still nothing
on Admiral Takahashi.

00:23.549 --> 00:25.733
But they never mention him
by name, right?

00:25.810 --> 00:27.568
Ken Uehara.

00:27.645 --> 00:28.903
This is Amy.

00:28.980 --> 00:31.280
Is my baby okay?

00:31.357 --> 00:32.531
What's happening?

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

00:52.244 --> 00:53.511
Nakayama!

00:55.622 --> 00:57.390
Nakayama,
the new batch!

00:58.250 --> 01:00.017
He's
fogged over again.

01:01.086 --> 01:02.103
You'd think
a change of scenery

01:02.179 --> 01:03.220
would do him some good.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.180
My girl left me,

01:05.257 --> 01:06.890
and I'm still
doing my job.

01:06.967 --> 01:08.225
Not saying
it's the same...

01:08.302 --> 01:11.562
But it's the same.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.398
Your girl goes home
to Pocatello,

01:14.475 --> 01:16.567
my infant sons are buried
in a prison camp.

01:16.644 --> 01:17.702
Come on.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.111
Bob'd take a bullet for you.

01:19.188 --> 01:21.122
I wish he would.

01:21.198 --> 01:22.582
It'd shut him up.

01:28.131 --> 01:29.380
He's cracked.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.624
Truth be told,

01:32.635 --> 01:35.970
I'm hoping that new batch
of translators gets here soon.

01:48.884 --> 01:52.978
You know what
my cousin told me?

01:52.989 --> 01:54.229
Before you ship out,

01:54.306 --> 01:56.106
look to the man
on your right

01:56.183 --> 01:57.900
and the one
on your left.

01:57.976 --> 01:58.993
One of them's
comin' home

01:59.070 --> 02:00.569
in a body bag.

02:00.646 --> 02:01.904
Yeah, right...

02:01.980 --> 02:03.947
and if both of 'em make it,

02:04.024 --> 02:05.583
then it's gonna be you.

02:07.912 --> 02:10.245
Hey, lighten up.
That's just frontline grunts.

02:10.322 --> 02:11.997
We haven't lost
a single translator.

02:12.074 --> 02:15.000
Now, I heard a fella
in Guadalcanal

02:15.077 --> 02:18.337
took a flamethrower to the face,

02:18.348 --> 02:20.348
came out fresh as a daisy.

02:21.834 --> 02:23.759
So...

02:23.836 --> 02:25.094
you're saying we're due?

02:25.170 --> 02:26.804
If so,

02:26.880 --> 02:28.189
my money's on Terajima.

02:28.265 --> 02:31.600
He's been looking
spooked all day.

02:31.677 --> 02:32.810
What do you think, 'Jima?

02:32.886 --> 02:33.903
Take one for Uncle Sam?

02:34.888 --> 02:37.106
They'll name
a pagoda after you.

02:40.394 --> 02:43.320
Remember when
he used to be fun?

02:50.213 --> 02:51.537
Pick it up!

02:51.547 --> 02:53.622
Hey...

02:53.699 --> 02:56.050
Let's win us
some scalps, huh?

03:11.467 --> 03:13.475
Hey, where's
Guadalcanal at, anyway?

03:13.552 --> 03:14.735
Solomon Islands.

03:14.812 --> 03:16.687
Where's that?

03:16.763 --> 03:17.947
I guess
we'll find out.

03:59.208 --> 04:04.208
Subtitles by explosiveskull
www.OpenSubtitles.org

04:13.820 --> 04:15.079
What this?

04:15.081 --> 04:18.298
"Statement
of United States Citizen

04:18.375 --> 04:20.634
of Japanese Ancestry."

04:20.711 --> 04:22.377
Fill it out,
turn it in.

04:22.454 --> 04:24.254
Just have to prove
you're a loyal American.

04:24.331 --> 04:27.090
This we must prove?

04:27.167 --> 04:29.894
Just fill it out, pal.

04:31.338 --> 04:32.480
A loyalty
questionnaire?

04:32.556 --> 04:33.981
We put this stuff
in writing,

04:34.058 --> 04:35.474
they'll throw it
back in our faces.

04:35.485 --> 04:37.050
Still,

04:37.128 --> 04:39.770
first time anybody upstairs
has mentioned letting us out.

04:39.846 --> 04:40.821
Maybe we'll get to enlist.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.440
That's your best-case
scenario, Yoshida?

04:43.517 --> 04:45.659
Get your head blown off
for the glory of FDR?

04:45.736 --> 04:47.828
Be sent to Japan,
be sent to jail,

04:47.905 --> 04:48.871
or be sent to die.

04:50.649 --> 04:52.917
This whole thing's a trap.
It's plain as a <i>hakujin's</i> nose.

05:03.328 --> 05:05.179
I must speak with Major Bowen.

05:05.256 --> 05:07.515
Make confession.

05:08.834 --> 05:10.676
"Confession"
is not a good word to be using

05:10.686 --> 05:11.593
in here, Yamato-san.

05:11.670 --> 05:14.680
In 1925,

05:14.690 --> 05:19.101
I donate tinfoil to collection
for Japanese Navy.

05:19.177 --> 05:20.519
I only give

05:20.530 --> 05:23.021
to make man
at my door go away.

05:23.098 --> 05:25.858
No room to explain that.

05:25.934 --> 05:28.369
Say nothing about this.

05:34.109 --> 05:35.492
Release docs

05:35.569 --> 05:36.827
from yesterday's
overnighter.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.412
I don't know why Japs like

05:38.488 --> 05:40.256
sleeping in the stockade
so much.

05:41.241 --> 05:44.668
I guess some people
feel the need to protest.

05:44.745 --> 05:45.886
Protest?

05:45.963 --> 05:48.389
Ingratitude is what it is,

05:48.465 --> 05:50.716
and now this goddamn
questionnaire?

05:50.726 --> 05:52.226
The WRA's all over my ass

05:52.303 --> 05:53.394
to get 100%
response rate,

05:53.470 --> 05:54.845
and everybody's
bitching and moaning.

05:54.921 --> 05:56.564
No one wants to answer wrong.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.732
It's 30 goddamn questions.

05:58.809 --> 05:59.733
Half of 'em are "yes" or "no."

05:59.810 --> 06:00.901
It should take five minutes,

06:00.978 --> 06:02.052
and here I thought

06:02.129 --> 06:04.146
y'all were supposed
to be obedient.

06:04.222 --> 06:05.573
I mean...

06:05.649 --> 06:06.740
you're reasonable,

06:06.817 --> 06:09.702
but the rest of 'em,
holy Moses.

06:11.155 --> 06:13.289
Yes, you laid out the rules
so clearly.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.329
Consequences
for non-compliance

06:20.405 --> 06:22.581
is what there
needs to be.

06:22.592 --> 06:24.466
Stern ones.

06:35.721 --> 06:37.596
You get through
the Aoki diary?

06:37.607 --> 06:39.014
It confirms
Admiral Takahashi

06:39.091 --> 06:41.516
did some psychological
experiments on Crittenden,

06:41.593 --> 06:44.069
but nothing about how, or...

06:44.930 --> 06:46.563
if there's others.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.606
"We have no goals

06:47.683 --> 06:49.107
save that our bodies
might shatter

06:49.118 --> 06:51.118
into glorious shards of pearl."

06:51.195 --> 06:54.279
I always translate
"tama" as "jade,"

06:54.356 --> 06:55.948
but I actually
like "pearl" better.

06:56.024 --> 06:57.949
That guy was a bit of a poet

06:57.960 --> 06:59.910
before we ground him
into hamburger.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.788
Well, at least we know
what made Crittenden break,

07:02.798 --> 07:04.340
and it wasn't some <i>yurei.</i>

07:06.877 --> 07:08.969
I was so sure that it was here,

07:09.046 --> 07:11.254
but it was back at camp
the whole time.

07:11.331 --> 07:13.632
It wanted me to come here,

07:13.643 --> 07:15.717
so it could get to Luz.

07:15.794 --> 07:19.137
Chester, I used to mop up
the infirmary at Manzanar.

07:19.148 --> 07:20.597
It doesn't take some evil spirit

07:20.674 --> 07:21.857
for something to go bad
in those camps.

07:23.719 --> 07:25.310
There was never a <i>yurei.</i>

07:25.321 --> 07:26.395
If there isn't
a <i>yurei,</i>

07:26.471 --> 07:28.647
that just means
I came here for what?

07:28.658 --> 07:29.657
Nothing?

07:29.733 --> 07:31.608
Nothing?

07:31.685 --> 07:34.495
There's a live P.O.W.
from Takahashi's unit

07:34.571 --> 07:35.696
right now...

07:35.772 --> 07:37.164
And neither of us
is allowed in the room,

07:37.241 --> 07:38.448
because the Harvard
interrogator's

07:38.525 --> 07:40.125
afraid we'll spot
his shitty Japanese.

07:42.746 --> 07:44.621
Look at us.

07:44.698 --> 07:45.839
Useless to our country,

07:45.916 --> 07:48.008
useless to our families.

07:48.085 --> 07:49.343
What are we?

07:50.680 --> 07:52.963
What am I?

07:53.039 --> 07:55.307
That's a little philosophical
for my speed.

08:00.264 --> 08:01.981
You play? Used to?

08:03.600 --> 08:05.308
Second base
in the Nisei League.

08:05.385 --> 08:06.852
There you go.

08:06.862 --> 08:08.478
That's something.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.155
You're a ball player.

08:12.517 --> 08:13.525
Stallings
needs the both of you.

08:13.602 --> 08:15.744
I think it's serious.

08:20.692 --> 08:22.659
Major Tebry Van Allen's
our best interrogator,

08:22.736 --> 08:26.329
but he's hit a bit
of a snag with this P.O.W.

08:26.406 --> 08:28.999
Our prisoner fell two miles
out of his Zero,

08:29.075 --> 08:30.792
so he's not his best self.

08:30.869 --> 08:31.885
Now's the time
to press him.

08:31.962 --> 08:33.003
That's why I've got
a new interrogator

08:33.078 --> 08:34.296
en route from Brisbane.

08:34.371 --> 08:36.131
Your job is
to babysit the prisoner

08:36.207 --> 08:37.131
till he gets here.

08:37.208 --> 08:38.133
These Ivy League
guys

08:38.210 --> 08:39.217
can't imagine
what it's like

08:39.227 --> 08:40.802
to think
like a Japanese.

08:40.879 --> 08:42.136
They won't
get anywhere.

08:42.214 --> 08:43.722
You got a better idea,
Nakayama?

08:43.732 --> 08:46.183
Sir, I think Chester
is asking permission

08:46.259 --> 08:47.893
for us to speak
with the prisoner.

08:47.903 --> 08:49.811
Denied.
You're not interrogators.

08:49.888 --> 08:51.238
You chose us for a reason.

08:51.315 --> 08:52.856
Let us show you
what we can do.

08:54.059 --> 08:55.659
Major Van Allen.

09:28.426 --> 09:31.728
What did he
call you?

09:31.805 --> 09:33.522
A <i>shiryô.</i>

09:33.598 --> 09:34.731
It's...

09:34.808 --> 09:35.866
an ancient word.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.567
It means
something like

09:37.644 --> 09:39.361
"dead man,

09:39.437 --> 09:41.455
walking amongst the living."

09:41.532 --> 09:42.614
Well, keep
watch on him,

09:42.625 --> 09:44.074
and regardless
of what he calls you,

09:44.150 --> 09:45.459
don't engage.

09:45.536 --> 09:47.035
We've got professionals
for that.

09:47.112 --> 09:49.046
Understood?

10:05.480 --> 10:07.172
For a few minutes there,

10:07.249 --> 10:09.266
it almost felt like
we weren't in prison.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.226
Minutes, huh?

10:11.303 --> 10:13.320
I'm a little sweet
on you too,

10:13.397 --> 10:16.231
Inmate 30893-C.

10:16.308 --> 10:17.107
Mm-hmm...

10:18.636 --> 10:21.820
Do you think the MPs know
which barracks are empty?

10:21.831 --> 10:23.446
If any one of 'em
could find a girl,

10:23.523 --> 10:24.832
he'd be doing
the same as us.

10:29.004 --> 10:30.453
What if they use
that questionnaire

10:30.530 --> 10:31.362
to draft you?

10:31.364 --> 10:33.164
I promise,
I'm not gonna let

10:33.175 --> 10:34.958
some stupid answers
on a stupid paper

10:35.035 --> 10:37.344
keep us apart.

10:41.249 --> 10:43.466
Five Mississippi,
four Mississippi,

10:43.543 --> 10:45.343
three Mississippi,

10:45.420 --> 10:49.356
two Mississippi,
one Mississippi.

10:49.433 --> 10:50.983
Ready or not,
here I come!

10:58.975 --> 11:00.191
There she is,

11:00.202 --> 11:01.160
the ghost woman.

12:51.463 --> 12:52.721
Sir...

12:52.797 --> 12:55.607
the prisoner
wants to engage.

12:56.968 --> 12:59.728
Biting a man's ear off
is a kind of engagement.

12:59.804 --> 13:02.397
If he knows Takahashi,
this is our chance.

13:02.474 --> 13:03.548
Did you notice

13:03.550 --> 13:04.566
how the prisoner
was looking at you?

13:04.642 --> 13:05.442
Mm-mm. How?

13:05.518 --> 13:06.985
He wasn't.

13:06.996 --> 13:09.329
He was staring at me.

13:09.406 --> 13:11.156
A white man's
just the enemy to him,

13:11.166 --> 13:12.115
but I'm something
different.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.742
A traitor.

13:13.818 --> 13:15.168
A <i>shiryô.</i>

13:15.245 --> 13:16.619
That means I can get him
off-balance,

13:16.696 --> 13:17.963
maybe even
get inside his head.

13:21.993 --> 13:24.094
You sure you got
your own marbles in order?

13:26.372 --> 13:28.348
Absolutely, sir.

13:28.425 --> 13:31.301
I'm here to serve.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.636
Major Bowen will cut
our rations unless we answer!

13:33.713 --> 13:34.929
What do you expect us to do?

13:35.006 --> 13:36.356
Say nothing.

13:36.433 --> 13:38.349
I know you're hungry.
I am too.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.360
You might be scared,
but that's what they want.

13:40.437 --> 13:41.770
We just
want to eat.

13:41.846 --> 13:43.521
It's our constitutional
right not to answer.

13:43.532 --> 13:44.814
You remember Amendment Five?

13:44.891 --> 13:46.608
It's illegal to even ask.

13:46.684 --> 13:48.985
They certainly can't starve us
or scare us into answering!

13:49.062 --> 13:49.986
You know
that guy's only happy

13:50.063 --> 13:51.029
when he's
rocking the boat.

13:51.106 --> 13:52.280
Yoshida...

13:52.357 --> 13:53.682
if you don't
rock the boat,

13:53.684 --> 13:54.908
you're as bad as the <i>ketoh</i>
locking us up.

13:54.984 --> 13:56.376
That's enough!

13:56.453 --> 13:57.535
Get down!

14:00.115 --> 14:02.215
Failure to complete
and submit the form

14:02.292 --> 14:05.543
will be construed
as treasonous behavior,

14:05.620 --> 14:08.722
subject to indefinite
imprisonment.

14:15.064 --> 14:16.679
Excuse me, Major,

14:16.756 --> 14:18.139
but treason?

14:18.216 --> 14:19.232
Even if they don't
answer at all?

14:20.927 --> 14:23.478
We're not playing games here,
Miss Yoshida,

14:23.555 --> 14:27.148
and make sure your boyfriend
over there knows that.

14:27.225 --> 14:29.192
Just because a barrack is empty

14:29.269 --> 14:31.703
doesn't mean I don't know
what's going on in it.

15:41.507 --> 15:44.443
...Chester...

16:04.364 --> 16:06.715
He's playing you.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.340
What was that?

16:57.417 --> 16:59.059
Why did you
say that?

16:59.794 --> 17:01.344
- Why'd you say that...
- Leave it!

17:31.618 --> 17:33.835
Have you even looked at
questions 27 and 28?

17:33.911 --> 17:35.003
"Are you willing to serve

17:35.079 --> 17:36.671
in the armed forces
of the United States

17:36.748 --> 17:38.506
on combat duty,
wherever ordered?"

17:38.583 --> 17:40.433
They just want you
to mark "yes."

17:40.510 --> 17:41.768
Anyone who says "yes,"
they'll draft.

17:41.845 --> 17:43.594
Anyone who says "no,"
they'll throw in prison.

17:43.605 --> 17:44.604
It's not just prison.

17:44.681 --> 17:46.931
Bowen says they'll
try you for treason.

17:47.008 --> 17:48.057
"Will you swear
unqualified allegiance

17:48.134 --> 17:49.434
to the United States of America

17:49.444 --> 17:51.436
and to faithfully defend
the United States

17:51.446 --> 17:54.439
from any and/or all attack
by foreign or domestic forces,

17:54.449 --> 17:56.774
and forswear
any form of allegiance

17:56.785 --> 17:58.443
to the Japanese emperor?"

17:58.519 --> 18:00.403
It's just stupid answers, Ken,

18:00.480 --> 18:01.946
on a stupid paper.

18:01.957 --> 18:03.197
Do like Walt did.

18:03.274 --> 18:04.332
Write "yes" twice.

18:05.368 --> 18:08.244
"Forswear any allegiance
to the emperor?"

18:08.321 --> 18:09.871
I was born here.

18:09.947 --> 18:11.039
I couldn't live with myself

18:11.115 --> 18:12.632
if I marked "yes"
to a question like that.

18:13.785 --> 18:15.251
If you mark "no,"

18:15.328 --> 18:17.470
they'll take you away,

18:17.547 --> 18:18.972
from me.

18:19.049 --> 18:23.602
Ken, please.

19:34.549 --> 19:35.873
Chester...

19:50.381 --> 19:51.889
"No" to 27.

19:51.966 --> 19:53.349
"No" to 28.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.402
"No" to 27.
"No" to 28.

19:55.478 --> 19:58.154
"No" to 27. "No" to 28.

20:06.990 --> 20:09.958
You don't want the man
who says yes to those questions.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.860
Someone's come to see you.

20:56.631 --> 20:57.881
<i>Ay, dios mío.</i>

20:59.784 --> 21:02.343
If your mother
could see you...

21:05.206 --> 21:08.308
I can't believe it.

21:18.344 --> 21:21.488
Um...

21:21.564 --> 21:25.274
a man came to the house,

21:25.351 --> 21:30.613
a sergeant in uniform,

21:30.690 --> 21:33.157
and he had news,

21:33.168 --> 21:36.336
from North Africa.

21:36.412 --> 21:37.212
Algeria.

21:38.864 --> 21:42.083
Dennis was doing transport

21:42.159 --> 21:43.084
in a convoy,

21:43.160 --> 21:47.013
and there was...
a battle,

21:47.090 --> 21:49.632
and it didn't, um...

21:49.709 --> 21:53.678
it didn't go our way.

21:53.688 --> 21:55.814
We lost...

21:57.600 --> 21:59.859
We lost your brother.

22:02.221 --> 22:04.981
<i>Mija,</i> you
shouldn't be here,

22:05.057 --> 22:06.190
in this place

22:06.267 --> 22:09.369
where your babies...

22:11.706 --> 22:15.083
It's time
you came home.

24:09.681 --> 24:12.784
What percentage Japanese
would you say your husband is?

24:14.663 --> 24:17.780
The man is not
her husband,

24:17.857 --> 24:19.707
but he's 100% Japanese.

24:21.378 --> 24:24.578
What kind of food do you
prepare for family dinners?

24:24.655 --> 24:25.630
Japanese food?

24:26.900 --> 24:29.667
She eats the food
you people prepare for her,

24:29.678 --> 24:31.293
obviously.

24:31.370 --> 24:34.296
Do you have any children
from the union?

24:34.373 --> 24:36.465
Sir.

24:36.542 --> 24:38.518
Please.

24:42.432 --> 24:43.856
It'll take
three to five days

24:43.933 --> 24:44.807
to process the request.

24:44.884 --> 24:45.808
You can go.

24:45.885 --> 24:46.943
Thank you.

24:48.012 --> 24:50.697
Enrique
and Hikaru.

24:50.773 --> 24:51.689
What's that,
Miss Ojeda?

24:51.766 --> 24:54.784
We had two children.

24:56.446 --> 24:59.831
I named them
Enrique and Hikaru...

26:51.227 --> 26:52.693
...Chester.

27:39.516 --> 27:41.742
<i>Question 27, "no."</i>

27:43.270 --> 27:45.830
<i>Question 28, "no."</i>

30:58.132 --> 30:59.848
Hey, hey,
cavalry's here!

30:59.859 --> 31:01.225
Glad to have
you boys relieving us.

31:01.235 --> 31:03.986
Didn't want you fellas
to hog all the action.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.197
Let's get you
set up.

31:08.559 --> 31:10.034
Coming,
Terajima?

31:38.605 --> 31:40.430
We're taking away
anyone who answered "no"

31:40.441 --> 31:43.192
to questions 27 and 28.

31:44.303 --> 31:45.945
Get your hands off me,
you jerk.

31:46.021 --> 31:47.271
No...

31:47.281 --> 31:49.398
I'm American.

31:49.474 --> 31:51.283
There are
twice as many guards

31:51.360 --> 31:52.618
in the higher-security camps.

31:52.695 --> 31:53.953
Your "No-no" boys

31:54.029 --> 31:55.237
will be well
taken care of.

31:55.314 --> 31:56.680
History will
remember this day!

31:56.757 --> 31:58.740
Your children will be ashamed
of what you've done!

31:58.817 --> 32:00.626
Lotta talk, Uehara.

32:00.703 --> 32:03.203
Should've known
you were full of shit.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.297
I answered "no,"
both questions,

32:05.374 --> 32:06.373
just like the others.

32:06.450 --> 32:07.967
Sure you did.

32:10.704 --> 32:13.380
Ken Uehara answered "yes"
to 27 and 28.

32:13.457 --> 32:15.641
That's all of 'em.

32:15.718 --> 32:16.633
You lied to us!

32:16.644 --> 32:17.926
I don't know
what happened!

32:18.003 --> 32:19.720
I swear
I answered "no."

32:19.796 --> 32:21.038
Coward!

32:23.884 --> 32:26.444
It was just two stupid words
on a stupid paper.

32:27.855 --> 32:30.564
At least
you're still here.

32:30.641 --> 32:32.199
Ken, please...

32:35.646 --> 32:37.037
Ken...

32:45.322 --> 32:46.422
Anything?

32:48.700 --> 32:50.167
No.

32:50.178 --> 32:51.126
Nothing.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.336
New guys are here.

32:52.346 --> 32:54.180
Apparently we're moving out.

32:54.256 --> 32:56.298
The new interrogator's
waiting for the prisoner

32:56.375 --> 32:58.017
at a P.O.W. camp in Guam.

32:59.211 --> 33:02.146
Maybe he'll get something
about Takahashi.

37:11.856 --> 37:13.430
We will let Chester
know what happened.

37:13.507 --> 37:18.185
He'll want to know
where to find you.

37:18.261 --> 37:20.696
I left him a letter.

37:27.788 --> 37:29.788
Please...

37:29.865 --> 37:32.782
give this back to Yuko.

37:32.793 --> 37:35.252
My midwife.

37:36.464 --> 37:38.338
She gave it to me as a gift.

37:41.159 --> 37:42.584
Yuko...

37:42.661 --> 37:44.178
gave this to you?

38:30.041 --> 38:30.933
Please...

38:32.502 --> 38:33.519
be safe.

38:39.860 --> 38:41.360
Be well.

39:38.443 --> 39:39.200
So...

39:39.277 --> 39:40.919
Ota broke free

39:40.996 --> 39:42.546
while your back
was turned, right?

39:43.883 --> 39:46.166
He got hold of
the dagger,

39:46.242 --> 39:47.667
and you had no opportunity
to stop him

39:47.744 --> 39:49.002
until it was too late.

39:49.079 --> 39:50.712
Right?

39:50.789 --> 39:51.546
Yes.

39:51.623 --> 39:52.931
Yes?

39:53.934 --> 39:54.808
Yes.

39:56.002 --> 39:57.394
Hmm, then that's what happened.

39:58.397 --> 39:59.679
It's not
the happiest ending,

39:59.756 --> 40:01.556
but at least you got
a breadcrumb on Takahashi.

40:01.633 --> 40:04.351
That's more than
Major Van Allen can say,

40:04.427 --> 40:05.226
or hear,

40:05.303 --> 40:06.945
for that matter.

40:07.022 --> 40:08.104
Get packed,

40:08.115 --> 40:09.615
and try to get some rest.

40:09.691 --> 40:11.533
I got bigger plans for you.

40:32.330 --> 40:33.755
Hey, are you okay?

41:14.831 --> 41:16.264
Nakay...?

41:17.542 --> 41:18.299
Stop that jeep!

41:18.376 --> 41:19.968
We got a runner!

41:21.379 --> 41:23.021
Shoot it if you have to!

41:23.098 --> 41:24.806
Aim for the tires!

42:51.853 --> 42:53.570
