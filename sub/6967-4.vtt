01:23.983 --> 01:25.610
Kids...

01:25.718 --> 01:27.709
Mom! Mom!

01:27.821 --> 01:29.482
Kevin!

01:41.634 --> 01:44.694
Mom! Ruby's gone!

01:47.107 --> 01:49.200
Ruby?

02:59.212 --> 03:01.612
Agent Mulder's latest 302.

03:01.681 --> 03:05.811
Requesting assignment
and travel expenses for the both of you.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.988
Sioux City, lowa.
That's the first I've heard of it.

03:12.091 --> 03:17.427
It came up through channels, from Mulder's
ASAC to the District G-14, then my desk.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.165
I don't understand.

03:21.034 --> 03:25.095
In essence,
Mulder is petitioning the Bureau

03:25.171 --> 03:28.800
to assign a case number
to a tabloid headline.

03:28.908 --> 03:32.901
- He must have more evidence than...
- Not according to his 302.

03:32.979 --> 03:35.038
I admit, that is strange.

03:36.349 --> 03:37.839
Even for Mulder.

03:48.194 --> 03:50.924
Perhaps it has something to do with this.

03:50.997 --> 03:52.555
Take a look.

03:52.632 --> 03:53.826
An X-File?

04:12.185 --> 04:14.050
Has he shared this with you?

04:16.089 --> 04:20.389
There's no need to protect him.
He initiated the file himself.

04:23.062 --> 04:25.155
She was his sister.

04:26.065 --> 04:29.296
She disappeared 21 years ago. He was

04:30.103 --> 04:31.764
12 and she was 8.

04:31.838 --> 04:35.035
He claims that he was in the room
when it happened.

04:35.108 --> 04:40.068
He recalls a...
bright light outside the window and

04:41.314 --> 04:43.441
a presence in the room.

04:43.516 --> 04:50.854
In your opinion, has Agent Mulder's personal
agenda clouded his professional judgment?

04:51.924 --> 04:53.414
In my opinion, no.

04:53.493 --> 04:56.223
But you can see
how it might appear that way?

04:58.197 --> 05:00.529
As you know,

05:00.633 --> 05:06.094
Mulder's preoccupation with fringe matters
has been a source of friction in the Bureau.

05:06.205 --> 05:08.264
This is another case in point.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.137
I'm going to disallow the 302.

05:12.245 --> 05:19.413
With respect, sir, at least let me talk with him
and make a recommendation.

05:19.485 --> 05:25.481
It just doesn't seem substantial enough
to warrant an investigation.

05:25.558 --> 05:29.688
So we disagree.
It's not the first time, it won't be the last.

05:29.762 --> 05:34.028
- If we had a legitimate source...
- This is the essence of science.

05:34.100 --> 05:38.764
Ask an impertinent question,
you're on your way to a pertinent answer.

05:38.871 --> 05:45.367
What makes this case any more credible than
the 100-year-old mother with the lizard baby?

05:45.478 --> 05:50.347
Because the lizard baby wasn't born
anywhere near Lake Okobogee.

05:50.450 --> 05:51.542
Oko-what?

05:51.651 --> 05:53.050
Bogee.

05:54.253 --> 05:56.118
Okobogee.

05:57.323 --> 05:59.382
Is that supposed to mean something to me?

05:59.492 --> 06:02.928
If you know anything about trout fishing.

06:03.062 --> 06:05.121
Or UFO hot spots.

06:06.132 --> 06:08.191
Define hot spot.

06:08.301 --> 06:14.536
Four sightings in 1967, August, including
one by a National Weather Service plane.

06:15.808 --> 06:19.767
This is a light-blasted
digitally-enhanced enlargement.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.710
The pilot took that?

06:21.781 --> 06:24.147
Try a Girl Scout with an Instamatic.

06:24.283 --> 06:29.186
Four girls said they saw something.
Five, including the Den Mother.

06:29.288 --> 06:32.587
The Air Force said it was a weather balloon.

06:32.692 --> 06:36.958
But no weather balloon was launched
that day within 700 miles.

06:39.966 --> 06:43.333
Now read me the names
of those Girl Scouts from 1967.

06:45.571 --> 06:49.803
Lisa Terrel, Bonnie Winston,
Doreen McCallister, Darlene Mor...

06:53.579 --> 06:56.309
It's the same Darlene Morris.

07:32.018 --> 07:35.954
Darlene Morris? I'm Agent Scully
and this is Agent Fox Mulder.

07:36.022 --> 07:38.650
We talked with you on the phone last night.

07:38.758 --> 07:40.817
Please come in.

07:44.997 --> 07:50.162
Well, I knew that if I screamed loud and long
enough that someone would listen.

07:50.236 --> 07:52.898
But I never expected the FBI.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.499
This is Kevin. Kevin,

07:56.609 --> 07:58.201
say hi.

08:01.848 --> 08:03.907
Would you like some coffee?

08:43.089 --> 08:45.216
Some days I can't even

08:45.291 --> 08:47.350
get myself up out of bed.

08:49.328 --> 08:52.764
And Kevin has been acting so strange.

08:54.267 --> 08:58.567
I don't know what to do any more.
I just want her back again.

08:58.671 --> 09:00.639
Ms Morris,

09:00.706 --> 09:04.733
during the divorce,
was there a custody battle?

09:05.645 --> 09:07.545
Charles had nothing to do with this.

09:07.647 --> 09:09.444
How can you be so sure?

09:09.949 --> 09:12.281
Because I know what happened.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.714
It's just like it was before.

09:15.788 --> 09:20.282
- Summer of 1967? The Girl Scout troop?
- How did you know about that?

09:20.359 --> 09:25.126
Your name's on record at the Center
for UFO Studies in Evanston, Illinois.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.965
Really?

09:28.067 --> 09:32.731
A pilot made a similar sighting
over the same area on the same day.

09:32.805 --> 09:35.069
They took her, didn't they?

09:41.981 --> 09:45.542
You... you said that,
Kevin was there the night it happened?

09:46.419 --> 09:48.785
He didn't see anything. He was asleep.

09:48.888 --> 09:50.822
Can I talk to him anyway?

09:52.992 --> 09:54.482
Thanks.

10:02.501 --> 10:04.560
You know,

10:04.637 --> 10:07.435
I've told this story so many times now.

10:07.540 --> 10:11.306
Go to the newspapers and the police.

10:12.979 --> 10:18.417
And every time I tell it,
people get this... look in their eye.

10:19.652 --> 10:22.780
Just like the look that you've got right now.

10:27.393 --> 10:29.623
Hey, buddy.

10:29.729 --> 10:31.788
Mind if I sit down?

10:32.331 --> 10:34.390
Thanks.

10:36.135 --> 10:39.070
Your mom tells me
you've been having nightmares.

10:39.672 --> 10:41.663
I guess so.

10:41.774 --> 10:44.334
- You wanna tell me about 'em?
- No.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.469
All right.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.577
What are you doing?

10:55.888 --> 10:57.788
You making something?

10:58.991 --> 11:01.016
Can I take a look at it?

11:06.232 --> 11:07.699
Thanks.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.697
It's coming from there.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.905
The TV?

11:29.588 --> 11:36.460
Maybe it's a binary sequence.
Could be anything, could be nothing.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.190
I know you're busy.

11:38.264 --> 11:43.634
Look, I know a friend who knows a friend
who can get you a ticket to a Redskins game.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.261
You got it!

11:45.404 --> 11:47.668
All right. You know where to find me?

11:47.740 --> 11:49.833
Thanks, Danny.

11:50.443 --> 11:54.641
So, as I was telling your partner,
we found no evidence of kidnap.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.739
No phone call, no ransom note.

11:56.849 --> 12:01.047
- And since we have no body...
- You assumed she ran away?

12:01.120 --> 12:04.886
It wouldn't be the first time
Ruby ran away from home.

12:04.957 --> 12:06.925
How do you explain what her mother saw?

12:08.561 --> 12:14.727
I think Darlene has a very active imagination.
I've heard those stories since first grade.

12:14.834 --> 12:17.325
So, basically, you ignored her statement.

12:21.240 --> 12:25.700
- I included it in my report.
- But you didn't bother to check it out.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.678
We found nothing at the campsite.

12:27.747 --> 12:32.116
Let me tell you something.
Darlene's little girl was no prom queen.

12:32.184 --> 12:36.518
I can't count the number of times
I pulled her out of parked cars

12:36.589 --> 12:38.921
or found her puking her guts out.

12:38.991 --> 12:42.154
- It was just a matter of time before...
- Before what?

12:44.797 --> 12:50.167
Before something bad happened. If Darlene
makes up stories to get past that, fine.

12:50.269 --> 12:54.797
But don't tell me it's the truth.
I'm not gonna waste my time.

12:56.876 --> 13:00.277
I just think it's a good idea
not to antagonize local law enforcement.

13:00.346 --> 13:02.712
Who, me? I'm Mr Congeniality.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.512
We might need his help one of these days.

13:05.584 --> 13:07.677
I'll send him a Bundt cake.

13:45.724 --> 13:48.386
You're looking for Ruby, right?

13:48.460 --> 13:49.859
That's right.

13:49.962 --> 13:51.725
Who are you?

13:51.797 --> 13:53.196
Doesn't matter.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.963
Are you a friend of Ruby's?

13:56.035 --> 14:01.234
Ruby didn't have friends.
She just had people she liked to hang with.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.070
And she liked to hang out with you?

14:04.944 --> 14:07.003
I guess we had some times.

14:07.079 --> 14:10.173
- Like the night she disappeared?
- It was Greg.

14:10.249 --> 14:12.945
She was supposed to see him that night.

14:13.018 --> 14:16.647
- Who's Greg?
- Her boyfriend, Greg Randall.

14:17.823 --> 14:21.816
Supposed to meet up at the lake.
They had stuff to talk about.

14:21.894 --> 14:23.293
What kind of stuff?

14:23.863 --> 14:25.763
Greg got Ruby pregnant.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.660
Whatever. She got herself pregnant.

14:31.036 --> 14:34.437
Do you know
what they were planning to do about it?

14:34.506 --> 14:38.875
They were gonna leave town.
At least that's what Ruby told me.

14:40.179 --> 14:42.044
You know Greg from school?

14:43.282 --> 14:45.375
Greg? School?

14:45.451 --> 14:47.817
I don't think so.

14:47.887 --> 14:52.688
All he ever did since we met him
was pour beer. The Pennsylvania Pub.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.835
Excuse me! Do you know
where we can find Greg Randall?

15:38.904 --> 15:40.963
Who's asking?

15:46.312 --> 15:48.280
What kind of trouble's he in now?

15:48.914 --> 15:50.973
We were hoping you could tell us.

15:51.917 --> 15:55.353
Greg called in sick three weeks ago.
I haven't heard from him since.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.288
Any ideas where he might have gone?

15:58.958 --> 16:01.756
No, but if you find him, tell him he's fired.

16:02.361 --> 16:05.194
This is our hotel if you hear of anything.

16:13.872 --> 16:16.340
That's a nice tattoo. What is that?

16:16.408 --> 16:18.273
What's it look like?

16:18.344 --> 16:22.781
A flying saucer.
You don't believe that stuff, do you?

16:22.881 --> 16:24.576
I take it you don't?

16:24.717 --> 16:29.381
No, I think it's just a bunch of crazy people
howling at the moon.

16:29.488 --> 16:33.151
So, you haven't been out
to Lake Okobogee, have you?

16:34.326 --> 16:35.725
No, I haven't. Why?

16:35.794 --> 16:38.524
You should ride with us some time.

16:38.597 --> 16:42.533
You might see some things
that'd change your mind.

16:46.038 --> 16:48.973
Get a killer sunburn
in the middle of the night.

17:46.265 --> 17:48.358
Where's Mulder?

17:51.236 --> 17:53.295
Where did you get the document?

17:53.405 --> 17:57.205
If you explain what you're talking about,
maybe I can help.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.510
This is a document?

18:07.619 --> 18:10.588
It just looks like
a bunch of ones and zeros to me.

18:10.656 --> 18:14.524
- Tell me where you got it.
- Tell me what it is.

18:14.626 --> 18:17.686
Keep playing games
and you'll be facing the D6.

18:17.796 --> 18:21.391
You can explain to them
why you're obstructing justice.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.697
It's your call, Holtzman.

18:23.802 --> 18:27.898
But I'm not accountable to anybody
outside my subcommittee.

18:28.006 --> 18:31.669
I don't care if it's the NSA
or the Vatican police.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.311
It's a defense satellite transmission.

18:37.349 --> 18:38.611
You're kidding!

18:38.684 --> 18:42.950
A fragment, but highly classified.
We need to know where it came from.

18:43.055 --> 18:46.616
Well, sure.
I'll let you know as soon as I find out.

18:46.692 --> 18:50.628
You just bought yourself
a one-way back to Washington.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.357
We got it.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.663
Great.

19:05.377 --> 19:06.435
What?

19:06.512 --> 19:09.948
You shouldn't have told 'em.
They have no jurisdiction.

19:10.048 --> 19:14.985
Mulder, they're NSA. They think
the boy's a threat to national security.

19:15.087 --> 19:20.992
How can an 8-year-old boy who can barely
multiply be a threat to national security?

19:21.093 --> 19:22.754
People call me paranoid.

19:22.861 --> 19:28.993
How did Kevin obtain top-secret information?
Where do you think he got it from?

20:04.336 --> 20:06.395
Watch your step, ma'am.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.734
It'll be OK, baby. Don't worry.

20:12.811 --> 20:15.211
- It'll be OK.
- Come with me, son.

20:15.514 --> 20:16.776
Mom!

20:18.750 --> 20:20.342
Lt'll be all right, baby.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.613
Watch your head, please.

20:51.783 --> 20:54.251
You guys do really delicate work.

20:54.353 --> 20:56.821
Let's get this to Cryptography.

20:58.023 --> 21:00.548
I think we got what we needed. Thank you.

21:15.274 --> 21:19.210
- What is it?
- I'm not sure.

21:49.207 --> 21:54.736
- We scanned it through the mainframe.
- And none of the information is actionable?

21:54.846 --> 21:59.681
Other than the satellite transmission,
none of it is a national security risk.

21:59.751 --> 22:02.151
The boy's being released later.

22:02.254 --> 22:05.121
So it was just a random set
of ones and zeros?

22:05.223 --> 22:07.453
There was nothing random about it.

22:07.526 --> 22:08.891
I don't understand.

22:08.960 --> 22:13.659
All information can be rendered digitally
in a series of ones and zeros.

22:13.732 --> 22:19.329
When we downloaded the data, we found
an amazing range of... Well, see for yourself.

22:19.438 --> 22:21.372
Da Vinci's Universal Man.

22:25.243 --> 22:27.302
A DNA double helix.

22:29.047 --> 22:31.140
There's lots more.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.447
That's the Brandenburg Concertos.

22:37.522 --> 22:42.892
But they're just fragments. Some lines
from the Koran, a Shakespearean sonnet.

22:42.961 --> 22:45.555
Like someone's switching channels?

22:59.911 --> 23:01.970
- Mrs Morris?
- I have nothing to say to you.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.514
Please, give me a minute to explain.

23:09.221 --> 23:12.748
Would you please just wait over there
for mama? I'll be right there.

23:16.294 --> 23:20.355
- I thought you were supposed to help us.
- This has been a terrible mistake.

23:20.432 --> 23:24.368
The government will pay
for all repairs and damages.

23:24.436 --> 23:27.098
I don't want your money.
I want my daughter back.

23:27.205 --> 23:29.366
And I want you to leave us alone.

23:29.441 --> 23:32.205
But your son has seen something.

23:32.310 --> 23:36.303
You stay away from me
and you stay away from my child.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.549
Come on, honey.

23:45.624 --> 23:47.455
It's OK. Let's go now.

24:06.611 --> 24:09.136
I thought we were headed back into town.

24:10.382 --> 24:11.974
Where are we going?

24:12.651 --> 24:15.620
The boy is the key, Scully. I know it.

24:16.087 --> 24:19.056
- The key to what?
- Finding Ruby.

24:19.157 --> 24:21.990
Just think about it for a minute.

24:22.060 --> 24:25.860
He's receiving digitized data
from a television screen.

24:25.964 --> 24:29.161
Agent Atsumi
said it was a statistical aberration.

24:32.170 --> 24:38.075
- I admit it's not much of an explanation...
- I think that Kevin is a conduit of some kind.

24:38.176 --> 24:39.609
A conduit?

24:39.678 --> 24:43.614
A link... or a connection to whoever

24:44.182 --> 24:47.208
or whatever took Ruby that night.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.014
But how?

24:49.087 --> 24:53.023
If there was an abduction, it's likely
that Kevin was touched in some way.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.193
Mulder, I know what you're thinking.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.992
I know why this is so important to you.

25:07.105 --> 25:08.800
I know!

25:10.041 --> 25:14.341
But there is no evidence
indicating an abduction.

25:15.113 --> 25:17.604
That's why we're going to Lake Okobogee.

25:24.489 --> 25:29.017
According to the police photos,
Ruby and Kevin were sleeping right here.

25:29.094 --> 25:31.619
Just a stone's throw from the forest wall.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.687
Meaning what?

25:33.765 --> 25:37.724
Meaning anybody could have
come out of the forest to grab her.

25:41.339 --> 25:43.637
Have you noticed the tree line?

25:45.477 --> 25:47.240
Evidence of extreme heat.

25:48.146 --> 25:50.046
Or an electrical storm.

25:50.982 --> 25:54.474
Besides which, there's nothing
to connect it to the night

25:54.553 --> 25:57.454
- of Ruby's disappearance.
- That's true.

26:03.295 --> 26:06.458
Do you think lightning
could have caused this?

26:06.531 --> 26:10.934
Do you have any idea at what temperature
sand solidifies into glass?

26:12.003 --> 26:13.971
2,500° Fahrenheit.

26:15.006 --> 26:18.806
Something was out here. Something
hot enough to turn sand into glass.

26:18.910 --> 26:22.869
To singe those trees
and to blister the roof of that camper.

26:33.558 --> 26:35.287
Mulder!

26:35.393 --> 26:37.486
Look!

27:19.237 --> 27:20.727
What is it?

27:20.805 --> 27:24.764
It's a grave. Shallow, by the smell of it.

27:31.282 --> 27:32.647
What are you doing?

27:34.953 --> 27:37.615
Mulder, you are disturbing a crime scene.

27:41.292 --> 27:43.385
Stop!

27:44.429 --> 27:46.556
What if it's her?

27:47.399 --> 27:49.492
I need to know.

28:09.721 --> 28:11.188
Are you OK, Mulder?

28:11.256 --> 28:12.621
Fine.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.728
Looks like a male Caucasian.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.796
Sir.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.702
Victim's name was Greg Randall.

28:36.481 --> 28:39.917
- Ruby's boyfriend.
- Ruby had a lot of boyfriends.

28:40.018 --> 28:43.749
- Can I take a look at that?
- Go right ahead.

29:20.158 --> 29:21.648
Look at that.

29:21.726 --> 29:24.593
It's her. The girl from the library.

29:24.696 --> 29:25.754
Who?

29:25.864 --> 29:30.301
We didn't get her name, but she claimed
Greg and Ruby had run off together.

29:30.368 --> 29:34.168
Well, Doc Fowler's a buddy of mine.
Delivered both my kids.

29:34.272 --> 29:36.934
I can find out who had that appointment.

29:55.727 --> 29:57.786
Have a seat, Tessa.

30:07.939 --> 30:10.430
We know that you lied to us the other day.

30:10.542 --> 30:15.002
We know that you had the appointment
with Dr Fowler on August 7th.

30:15.113 --> 30:18.446
We know that you're pregnant, not Ruby.

30:18.550 --> 30:22.714
- Then you don't know nothing.
- We can prove it, Tessa.

30:22.787 --> 30:25.847
And we can prove that Greg... was the father.

30:25.957 --> 30:28.016
So what if he was the father?

30:28.126 --> 30:30.594
This is very serious.

30:30.728 --> 30:33.595
Do you understand how serious this is?

30:35.466 --> 30:37.764
You've waived the right to an attorney.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.964
So if you lie to us here today,

30:42.574 --> 30:45.042
you could be charged with perjury.

30:50.782 --> 30:53.342
He promised me we'd be in LA by Christmas.

30:54.552 --> 30:56.611
He had a friend there.

30:56.754 --> 30:58.984
And I'd never seen the ocean.

30:59.057 --> 31:01.890
You said he and Ruby
were seeing each other.

31:01.993 --> 31:06.362
You said they were planning
to meet at the lake. Is that true?

31:06.431 --> 31:10.367
Lookit, I was nowhere
near the lake that night, OK?

31:10.435 --> 31:12.369
Sure you were, Tessa.

31:14.639 --> 31:18.837
You knew they were meeting,
so you sat and you waited for them.

31:18.910 --> 31:21.811
- You were angry and jealous.
- I wasn't.

31:21.880 --> 31:26.317
You waited, and when they showed
you killed him first, isn't that how it went?

31:26.417 --> 31:29.284
- No.
- You snuck up and you shot him in the back.

31:29.387 --> 31:31.446
Bam!

31:33.191 --> 31:35.625
And then you killed Ruby.

31:35.693 --> 31:36.591
Bam!

31:39.864 --> 31:46.030
What was she doin' before she died? Was she
pleading for her life? Was she running away?

31:46.104 --> 31:47.537
I didn't kill her!

31:47.639 --> 31:49.504
- Where's she buried?
- I don't know!

31:49.607 --> 31:53.099
- You don't know where you buried her?
- I didn't kill her!

31:53.211 --> 31:56.840
- You didn't?
- She wasn't even there that night!

31:59.918 --> 32:05.254
Well, how would you know that, Tessa,
if you weren't there yourself?

32:11.129 --> 32:13.529
You're not seeing the whole picture here.

32:13.631 --> 32:17.931
- Which is?
- Which is that in all likelihood Ruby is dead.

32:18.036 --> 32:22.166
Is that your conclusion
or the Sioux City Sheriff's Department's?

32:22.273 --> 32:26.972
They're searching the National Park
and a dive team is going to drag the lake.

32:27.078 --> 32:28.909
They're wasting their time.

32:28.980 --> 32:31.574
Do you really think Tessa is telling the truth?

32:31.683 --> 32:35.141
Why not?
What if Ruby never did show up that night?

32:35.253 --> 32:38.882
She lied to us in the library
and lied about her pregnancy.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.517
Why wouldn't she lie about killing Ruby?

32:41.592 --> 32:45.153
Because something was out there
in those woods!

32:46.664 --> 32:51.067
We have a suspect in custody.
We have a confession to one murder

32:51.135 --> 32:55.196
and a statement which speaks
to the intent to commit another.

32:55.306 --> 32:59.936
It's over, Mulder. It's time
to turn this over to local law enforcement.

33:00.011 --> 33:01.501
I can't do that.

33:04.148 --> 33:06.946
- Mulder, where are you going?
- To talk to the boy.

33:07.018 --> 33:09.953
- Darlene won't let you.
- I've gotta see him.

33:10.021 --> 33:12.546
They don't want anything to do with us!

33:12.623 --> 33:15.786
Mulder, stop! Stop running after your sister.

33:20.531 --> 33:22.556
This won't bring her back.

33:23.901 --> 33:29.168
Come with me or don't, but until they
find a body I'm not giving up on that girl.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.979
Hello?

33:46.824 --> 33:48.951
Mrs Morris?

33:50.228 --> 33:52.321
Kevin?

34:26.664 --> 34:28.757
Mulder?

34:33.304 --> 34:35.397
What does it mean?

34:36.007 --> 34:38.065
I don't know.

34:40.812 --> 34:42.871
I'm gonna check upstairs.

34:53.591 --> 34:55.114
Oh, my God!

34:55.659 --> 34:57.287
What is it?

34:58.296 --> 34:59.456
Just come up here.

35:06.737 --> 35:08.227
Look.

35:10.641 --> 35:11.630
It's her!

35:13.244 --> 35:14.677
It's Ruby.

35:31.028 --> 35:33.690
This is a long shot. They could be anywhere.

35:35.700 --> 35:37.634
You know, when I was a kid

35:38.636 --> 35:40.263
I had this ritual.

35:42.874 --> 35:45.775
I'd close my eyes
before I walked into my room.

35:46.911 --> 35:50.472
Because I thought one day when
I opened them my sister would be there.

35:51.249 --> 35:55.242
Just lying in bed...
like nothing ever happened.

35:58.656 --> 36:00.783
I'm still walking into that room.

36:02.093 --> 36:04.152
Every day of my life.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.192
Scully!

36:23.181 --> 36:25.274
Darlene!

36:29.220 --> 36:31.313
Look, there's a trailhead.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.839
- Are you OK?
- It's here. I saw it.

36:52.944 --> 36:55.378
- Where's Kevin?
- I couldn't keep up.

36:55.446 --> 36:57.539
Go ahead!

37:10.528 --> 37:12.393
Kevin!

37:59.410 --> 38:02.470
- Are you OK?
- She's back!

38:02.580 --> 38:04.639
Kevin, I'm sorry, but...

38:05.283 --> 38:07.376
She's here. I know it!

38:08.019 --> 38:10.317
Kevin, I don't think she is.

38:10.421 --> 38:14.790
- I know you wanted it to be her. I did too.
- Mulder!

38:14.859 --> 38:16.918
Come on!

38:18.462 --> 38:20.521
Scully?

38:24.669 --> 38:26.136
Ruby!

38:26.270 --> 38:28.329
She's unconscious but alive.

38:28.439 --> 38:30.907
I'll get help.

38:38.249 --> 38:41.047
She's been awake for almost an hour.

38:41.118 --> 38:43.245
Any ideas what caused the coma?

38:43.321 --> 38:48.349
No sign of head trauma, no narcotic traces
or electrolyte abnormalities.

38:48.459 --> 38:51.257
But her white blood cell count was sky-high.

38:51.329 --> 38:56.699
Any attendant reduction in the lymphocyte
population or release of glucocorticoids?

38:59.937 --> 39:02.371
Actually, both. How did you know that?

39:02.473 --> 39:05.931
They're symptoms
of prolonged weightlessness.

39:06.043 --> 39:09.376
Shuttle astronauts have reported
similar imbalances.

39:27.498 --> 39:29.557
Hi.

39:32.670 --> 39:35.002
Hi, Ruby.

39:36.607 --> 39:38.165
Who are you?

39:38.876 --> 39:43.870
We're with the FBI. I'm Special Agent
Dana Scully and this is Fox Mulder.

39:46.784 --> 39:48.911
My mom said you might be coming by.

39:48.986 --> 39:51.079
How are you feeling?

39:52.590 --> 39:54.683
Fine, I guess.

39:54.759 --> 39:56.818
Where were you, Ruby?

39:56.927 --> 39:58.622
Can you tell us?

40:01.966 --> 40:04.332
It's OK, Ruby. He knows.

40:06.904 --> 40:08.963
I'm not supposed to tell.

40:09.940 --> 40:11.931
They told me not to say.

40:12.009 --> 40:13.340
Who told you?

40:16.781 --> 40:18.612
Ruby, who told you?

40:20.017 --> 40:23.851
Sweetheart, you don't have to say anything.

40:25.022 --> 40:29.550
You're right. We should wait
till Ruby gets a little stronger.

40:29.627 --> 40:32.255
Can we speak outside for a moment?

40:44.008 --> 40:47.171
I think that it's best
that we put all of this behind us.

40:47.244 --> 40:50.407
I mean,
hasn't Ruby been through enough already?

40:50.481 --> 40:55.441
I know how disoriented she must seem
right now. But in a couple of weeks, we...

40:55.553 --> 40:58.351
I don't want her talking to you. Or anyone.

40:58.456 --> 41:03.860
She should be encouraged to tell her story.
It's important that you let her.

41:03.961 --> 41:05.758
Important to who?

41:07.164 --> 41:09.962
I have my daughter back.
I don't want more trouble.

41:10.034 --> 41:12.264
Besides, she can't remember anything.

41:12.369 --> 41:16.100
But she will remember one day,
even if it's only in dreams.

41:16.207 --> 41:20.644
When she does, she'll want to talk about it.
She'll need to talk about it.

41:21.078 --> 41:22.636
Like I did?

41:23.981 --> 41:25.812
Listen to me.

41:25.883 --> 41:29.284
I have been ridiculed for speaking my mind.

41:29.386 --> 41:31.581
But it was the truth, Darlene.

41:31.655 --> 41:36.490
It's caused me nothing but heartache.
I don't want the same thing for her.

41:36.594 --> 41:39.256
It doesn't have to be that way for Ruby.

41:41.465 --> 41:45.799
As far as I know, she spent the last month
on the back of a Harley-Davidson.

41:46.103 --> 41:48.537
Is that what you'll tell Kevin?

41:50.407 --> 41:52.068
I'm sorry.

42:24.141 --> 42:28.942
- Your eyes are open?
- Yeah, but it's like

42:29.046 --> 42:32.379
- nothing's happening.
- Try turning your head.

42:32.516 --> 42:34.575
I can't.

42:34.885 --> 42:36.944
- Why not?
- I don't know.

42:38.722 --> 42:40.781
I can't move.

42:41.358 --> 42:43.451
So I don't.

42:44.795 --> 42:49.129
- I just lie there in bed.
- Can you see your sister?

42:49.733 --> 42:51.394
No.

42:52.202 --> 42:53.965
But I can hear her.

42:54.071 --> 42:59.304
- What does she say?
- She's calling out my name

42:59.376 --> 43:01.469
over and over again.

43:02.212 --> 43:04.908
She's crying out for help.

43:04.982 --> 43:07.348
But I can't help her.

43:07.418 --> 43:09.545
I can't move.

43:10.120 --> 43:13.715
- Are you scared?
- I know I should be, but I'm not.

43:15.292 --> 43:19.695
- Do you know why?
- Because of the voice.

43:19.763 --> 43:22.493
- The voice?
- The voice in my head.

43:22.600 --> 43:26.297
- What's it telling you?
- Not to be afraid.

43:27.404 --> 43:31.135
It's telling me that no harm will come to her.

43:31.208 --> 43:33.301
And that one day she'll return.

43:34.511 --> 43:36.113
Do you believe the voice?

43:36.113 --> 43:36.602
Do you believe the voice?

43:38.349 --> 43:40.408
I want to believe.
