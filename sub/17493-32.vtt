# Sarah and Duck
HE QUACKS

00:07.360 --> 00:08.880
# Sarah and Duck

00:08.880 --> 00:10.080
#SHE QUACKS

00:11.320 --> 00:12.360
# Sarah and Duck. #

00:12.360 --> 00:13.400
HE QUACKS

00:15.640 --> 00:19.120
This evening, Sarah and Duck are
taking a long-awaited trip

00:19.120 --> 00:20.480
to the observatory

00:20.480 --> 00:24.760
to view a comet that won't be seen
again for many years.

00:24.760 --> 00:26.080
Oooh.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.200
So, that's the comet, eh?

00:28.200 --> 00:29.480
Uh-huh.

00:30.680 --> 00:33.280
Think of it, chap,

00:33.280 --> 00:36.400
like a giant rocky snowball,

00:36.400 --> 00:38.520
flying through space.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.160
Oh! Bus, bus.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.440
Observatory, please.

00:47.440 --> 00:48.480
On you go, then.

00:48.480 --> 00:49.720
HE QUACKS

00:56.720 --> 00:58.240
Hurry, please.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.040
Comet's coming!

01:00.040 --> 01:02.440
Don't worry, Sarah.
We'll get there soon.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.600
SHE GROANS

01:14.280 --> 01:16.480
Very impressive.

01:16.480 --> 01:17.760
Uh-huh!

01:19.960 --> 01:22.360
Where's the telescope?

01:22.360 --> 01:24.320
Oh, must still be inside.

01:32.320 --> 01:34.320
HE QUACKS

01:34.320 --> 01:35.560
CLATTERING

01:35.560 --> 01:37.200
Uh, Sarah...

01:40.440 --> 01:42.040
Oh, sorry, Duck.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.960
SHE GRUNTS

01:54.240 --> 01:56.160
Whoa!

01:56.160 --> 01:58.960
Big telescope.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.200
Indeed.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.080
Ooh!

02:05.080 --> 02:08.000
These must be pieces of
actual comets.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.400
Whoa.

02:09.400 --> 02:14.760
It says sometimes bits of comets
and meteors break off,

02:14.760 --> 02:16.560
and land here on earth.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.480
Duck!

02:25.040 --> 02:27.320
Uh, best leave that alone, chap.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.600
You don't know what it...

02:28.600 --> 02:30.360
HE QUACKS

02:30.360 --> 02:31.400
..does.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.720
Duck!

02:39.440 --> 02:40.760
Whoa!

02:42.440 --> 02:44.160
Would you look at that.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.440
Come on, Duck.
HE QUACKS

02:59.280 --> 03:02.360
So many stars.

03:03.480 --> 03:04.600
Oh!

03:04.600 --> 03:07.320
Hello, Mars. What, oh?!

03:07.320 --> 03:08.720
Hello, Venus.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.760
Are you here for the comet too?

03:10.760 --> 03:13.320
Yes, comet is a dear friend of ours.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.160
But we haven't seen him
in a very long time.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.040
When's he going to get here?

03:18.040 --> 03:19.560
Should be any minute.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.800
Oh! Excuse me, Duck.

03:22.800 --> 03:26.960
Oh! Why don't we hide and surprise
comet when he arrives?

03:26.960 --> 03:28.280
Oh, yes.

03:28.280 --> 03:29.400
He loves a joke.

03:33.640 --> 03:36.320
SHE CHUCKLES
See anything, Sarah?

03:36.320 --> 03:37.720
Not yet.

03:40.480 --> 03:41.800
SHE GASPS
There!

03:42.840 --> 03:45.000
Now!
BOTH: Surprise!

03:45.000 --> 03:47.600
HE SCREAMS
Look out!

03:47.600 --> 03:49.240
Whoa!
HE QUACKS

03:52.080 --> 03:54.200
Well, that didn't go to plan,
did it?

03:54.200 --> 03:56.320
Um, no.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.280
Come on, this way.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.640
I knew it was a bad idea.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.080
Hello?

04:06.080 --> 04:09.120
HE GASPS
Watch out, little, um...

04:09.120 --> 04:10.760
Human?

04:10.760 --> 04:12.640
I'm a girl.
HE QUACKS

04:12.640 --> 04:15.160
Oh, right!

04:15.160 --> 04:17.520
Little GIRL.

04:17.520 --> 04:22.720
There are some big thingies
lurking around.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.680
Thingies?

04:24.680 --> 04:27.080
Do you mean Mars and Venus?

04:27.080 --> 04:28.120
Who?

04:28.120 --> 04:29.360
Your friends.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.040
Comet!

04:31.040 --> 04:34.600
So good to see you, old man.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.640
Sorry, do I know you? Do I?

04:38.680 --> 04:40.320
Comet, it's us.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.400
Vee-Vee and Marsy.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.720
Um, I don't mean to be rude,

04:45.720 --> 04:47.480
but it's just that...

04:47.480 --> 04:52.240
I don't remember ever meeting you,
Vee-Vee and Marsy.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.360
What?!

04:53.360 --> 04:56.120
SHE SIGHS
I don't understand.

04:56.120 --> 04:59.640
The truth is my memory has
not been the same

04:59.640 --> 05:01.720
since the last time I was here.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.520
Was I here? Yes, I was here.

05:04.520 --> 05:05.840
It's as if I...

05:05.840 --> 05:07.640
I left it behind.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.200
Oh!

05:09.200 --> 05:10.520
You're missing a bit.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.720
Certainly feels that way.

05:13.720 --> 05:17.280
I think she means you're actually
missing a bit.

05:17.280 --> 05:20.520
Hmm. Could be.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.840
IN SCOTTISH ACCENT:
Oh, nay, lad. That's nay the piece.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.440
How about this bit?

05:31.920 --> 05:33.480
HE HOWLS

05:33.480 --> 05:36.520
Oh, deary. Definitely not.

05:37.520 --> 05:38.960
Oh!

05:38.960 --> 05:40.280
What about this one?

05:43.360 --> 05:45.400
Hmm. Looks about right.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.240
HE GASPS

05:52.240 --> 05:54.400
I... I-I...

05:55.760 --> 05:58.840
I remember!
HE CHUCKLES

06:00.720 --> 06:03.360
The last time I was here a bit
of me broke off

06:03.360 --> 06:05.480
and fell down here somewhere,

06:05.480 --> 06:07.080
but I was in such a hurry,

06:07.080 --> 06:08.840
I didn't stop to find it.

06:08.840 --> 06:12.800
So, you literally lost your memory.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.840
Apparently.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.320
Oh, thank you, little girl.

06:17.320 --> 06:18.760
That's OK.

06:18.760 --> 06:21.560
HE GASPS
Venus, Mars!

06:21.560 --> 06:22.880
There you are.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.120
Moon says hello.
He was sorry to miss you.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.880
He's working late tonight.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.160
How've you been? Oh, fine.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.880
Just keeping on the move.

06:32.880 --> 06:35.640
What's it like on the other side
of the Sun?

06:35.640 --> 06:38.200
Oh, there's really not much
out there.

06:38.200 --> 06:41.200
Space dust doesn't talk much, but
Pluto...

06:41.200 --> 06:44.320
HE LAUGHS
Pluto, he's a real hoot!

06:45.600 --> 06:47.720
# Sarah and Duck

06:47.720 --> 06:49.760
# Sarah and Duck

06:49.760 --> 06:51.720
# Sarah and Duck

06:51.720 --> 06:53.600
# Sarah and Duck. #
