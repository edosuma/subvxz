00:01.268 --> 00:03.335
(silence)

00:10.845 --> 00:13.579
(ominous music)

00:58.025 --> 01:01.260
(children chattering)

01:12.706 --> 01:14.773
(saw whirring)

01:14.775 --> 01:17.576
(hammer banging)

01:18.446 --> 01:21.413
(sandpaper scraping)

01:21.415 --> 01:24.450
(brushing)

01:24.452 --> 01:27.286
(birds chirping)

01:39.133 --> 01:41.700
(dog barking)

01:58.619 --> 02:01.320
(phone ringing)

02:11.198 --> 02:14.032
(engine revving)

02:17.371 --> 02:18.837
- Overnight, you know
what I mean?

02:18.839 --> 02:19.771
So, you got it?

02:19.773 --> 02:21.140
- Okay.
- Okay, thanks.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.379
- Hello, handsome.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.348
- No public displays
of affection at school.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.250
- Oh, but you know
I'm a bad girl.

02:32.753 --> 02:33.719
- How bad?

02:33.721 --> 02:35.220
- So bad.

02:35.222 --> 02:36.321
- Really bad?

02:36.323 --> 02:37.256
- Very, very bad.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.691
- Say something sexy.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.328
- I finished unpacking
the last box today.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.797
We're completely moved in.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.399
- Oh, my god, I'm so turned on
right now.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.233
(laughing)

02:48.235 --> 02:49.134
It only took eight months.

02:49.136 --> 02:51.904
- But it's done, we're home.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.007
Only a few things left to do.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.308
- Oh, there's a few things
left, what few things?

02:56.310 --> 03:00.946
- It's nothing, you promised
me a door for the hall closet.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.665
- Oh, yeah.

03:02.666 --> 03:04.383
- And we need curtains
for the bedroom.

03:04.385 --> 03:07.252
And a rug for the guest room.

03:07.254 --> 03:08.587
- And that's it?

03:08.589 --> 03:09.655
- That's it.

03:10.791 --> 03:11.723
For now.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.258
(laughing)

03:13.260 --> 03:15.194
You knew what I was when you
married me.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.196
(groaning)

03:17.198 --> 03:18.764
Jesus, Ma, it's the principal.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.399
(laughing)

03:20.401 --> 03:22.000
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.602
Hello, Ms. Eden.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.671
- Hi, Ms. Raleigh, I'm
just here to pick up Kane

03:25.673 --> 03:27.839
and I'll quit distracting
your foreman.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.408
I must say, I think
he's doing a great job.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.443
- Ah, the work is above average.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.912
Although, we've been up
against the clock, haven't we?

03:33.914 --> 03:35.847
- Yes and I do need
to get back to work.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.182
- Oh, right.
- We gotta pour

03:37.184 --> 03:38.717
that concrete,
it's gonna set overnight.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.618
- Okay.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.485
- Back to the salt mine.

03:40.487 --> 03:41.853
- Okay, see you tonight.

03:41.855 --> 03:42.754
Poppy seed chicken.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.289
- Oh, I'm there.
- Okay.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.857
- And I do need to go get Kane,

03:45.859 --> 03:46.992
but I wanna thank you again

03:46.994 --> 03:49.394
for this opportunity
for my family.

03:49.396 --> 03:52.164
If it weren't for you and
the board allowing Red

03:52.166 --> 03:57.135
to trade for and the school
is gonna be so great.

03:59.540 --> 04:03.408
We could never do this right
now without this arrangement.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.777
- Kane is continuing to
assimilate here.

04:06.580 --> 04:11.016
It's more, than the teachers
would like, but I think

04:11.018 --> 04:13.986
there's a great chance,
that eventually

04:13.988 --> 04:15.487
he'll be a good fit here.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.589
- Well, thank you, thank you.

04:23.664 --> 04:27.332
(children whispering)

04:27.334 --> 04:29.668
(laughing)

04:36.076 --> 04:38.110
Hey, buddy, ready to go?

04:39.013 --> 04:41.980
Look what I found in a flee
market today.

04:41.982 --> 04:44.750
Remember, your favorite
one we lost in the move.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.118
- My car.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.052
- One just like it.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.553
- Thanks, mom.

04:48.555 --> 04:51.657
- You're so welcome, honey,
ready to go?

04:51.659 --> 04:53.125
- Yeah, let's go.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.996
- I'm so sorry, buddy,
I know it's hard,

04:58.999 --> 05:01.166
but we have to keep trying.

05:01.168 --> 05:04.269
- I hate this school, I
hate it, kids don't like me,

05:04.271 --> 05:07.572
the teachers are mean, I get
in trouble all day for nothing,

05:07.574 --> 05:09.608
Ms. Raleigh won't let me
have my car in the class,

05:09.610 --> 05:10.742
they hate me here.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.844
- They don't hate you,
they don't, Kane,

05:12.846 --> 05:14.413
they just don't know you yet.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.981
- I don't wanna
go to school here.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.549
- Well, that's not
up for discussion.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.217
- I don't wanna
go to school here.

05:19.219 --> 05:20.118
- Kane,

05:21.655 --> 05:23.689
when we moved here we thought
there would be more work

05:23.691 --> 05:25.991
for your daddy, but it was
slower, than we wanted and,

05:25.993 --> 05:29.261
you know, we wanna put
you in the best school

05:29.263 --> 05:33.131
we possibly can, you know
what Dr. Timmon said.

05:33.133 --> 05:36.835
- I have to go to a special
school, where they can help me,

05:36.837 --> 05:38.670
because my brain works
different.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.239
- That's right and you
don't have to be embarrassed

05:41.241 --> 05:42.274
about that, honey.

05:43.310 --> 05:46.545
We want the very best for you.

05:48.582 --> 05:52.117
And daddy is trading
work for you to be able

05:52.119 --> 05:53.819
to go to this special school.

05:55.356 --> 05:58.523
You know, we can't afford
it any other way, remember?

05:58.525 --> 06:01.043
- I remember.

06:01.044 --> 06:03.562
- Okay, so as long as daddy
is working for this school,

06:03.564 --> 06:07.399
this is your school, okay?

06:07.401 --> 06:08.967
- Okay.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.837
- Kane is good, he told
me to hug the phone,

06:11.839 --> 06:12.938
when you called.

06:13.841 --> 06:17.542
Yeah, Red is great,
the school job has been

06:17.544 --> 06:21.613
great word of mouth, lots of
compliments from the parents

06:21.615 --> 06:22.581
about the work.

06:24.451 --> 06:25.650
Well and you know,
they all have money

06:25.652 --> 06:26.585
or they'd be in a different
school, so.

06:26.587 --> 06:27.753
(doorbell ringing)

06:27.755 --> 06:31.456
Oh, hey, mom, I need
to go, I have a guest.

06:31.458 --> 06:34.059
Okay, I love you, okay, bye.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.496
(doorbell ringing)

06:37.498 --> 06:38.397
Coming.

06:41.769 --> 06:45.070
(hinges creaking)

06:45.072 --> 06:46.605
- Hi, Evelyn.

06:46.607 --> 06:47.806
- [Evelyn] Come inside.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.146
These swords always
freak me out.

06:54.148 --> 06:57.816
- Oh, they don't mean anything.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.384
- I know.

06:59.386 --> 07:00.952
- Not on their own.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.021
- I know, it's just a knee
jerk reaction.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.935
- It's all good.

07:18.038 --> 07:22.140
It about Red, your husband.

07:23.444 --> 07:28.513
More opportunities, more
freedom, more money.

07:29.383 --> 07:30.882
- Well, that's all good news.

07:32.186 --> 07:34.286
- Now, it's on you.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.826
(ominous music)

07:44.398 --> 07:46.465
- [Evelyn] What is this?

07:48.135 --> 07:53.205
- It's a Pisces, a portal
sending for you here an opening.

07:55.342 --> 07:58.844
- We've talked about starting
a new internet business

07:58.846 --> 08:00.412
to sell some of my hobby work.

08:01.448 --> 08:06.218
- Maybe, this is bigger.

08:07.221 --> 08:08.119
It is,

08:09.723 --> 08:10.989
you should be careful.

08:11.892 --> 08:12.791
- It's bad?

08:14.828 --> 08:19.531
- Anytime you open a new
door, you can never be sure

08:19.533 --> 08:24.202
what's on the other side of
the wall until you're there.

08:25.038 --> 08:29.474
It means this can
be good, it's dangerous.

08:30.410 --> 08:33.445
- You think this is dangerous?

08:34.248 --> 08:37.883
- I don't know, you
should be cautious,

08:37.885 --> 08:38.850
when you open...

08:38.852 --> 08:41.820
(door slamming)

08:41.822 --> 08:43.355
- Kane, whatever happened?

08:45.092 --> 08:46.391
- Go to your room.

08:46.392 --> 08:47.691
- They wouldn't stop
laughing at me, mom.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.027
- Kane.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.062
- Do what your dad
says, we'll talk later.

08:52.266 --> 08:54.299
- Juryah, good to see you.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.834
- Hello.

08:55.836 --> 08:56.735
- Excuse me.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.337
Really, the third visit
from the psychic?

08:59.339 --> 09:00.705
- I wanted him to
bless the house,

09:00.707 --> 09:02.741
now that we're finally
unpacked and he doesn't need

09:02.743 --> 09:04.576
to be called a
psychic, he's an augur.

09:04.578 --> 09:06.411
- He's a psychic
you found on Craigslist.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.980
- Humor me, I wanted the house
blessed.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.715
- Craigslist didn't
have priests?

09:13.587 --> 09:16.121
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.055
- Can he come back later?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.056
- Can he come back later?

09:18.058 --> 09:18.957
- Yes.

09:20.193 --> 09:23.128
- Alright, I took the
rest of the afternoon off

09:23.130 --> 09:25.263
to deal with this,
I'm gonna go shower.

09:29.236 --> 09:33.405
- Juryah, would you mind
coming back for the blessing

09:33.407 --> 09:34.406
next week?

09:35.409 --> 09:38.443
- Of course,
of course, next week.

09:41.615 --> 09:42.647
- So what happened?

09:44.685 --> 09:48.119
- He said, at lunch time all
these kids were laughing at him

09:48.121 --> 09:50.789
and he has to sit down and
they kept making fun of him

09:50.791 --> 09:53.291
and finally he hit one and
another kid jumped on him,

09:53.293 --> 09:55.860
and then the teachers
had to pull em apart.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.697
And then Raleigh calls me
in along with the councilor

09:58.699 --> 10:01.066
and sends him home for the day,
and now he's got a three day

10:01.068 --> 10:02.300
in-school suspension.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.703
- So what do we do now, Red.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.137
- I don't know, these
other kids are starting it.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.740
- No, no, he can't
hit other kids.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.675
- Well, he's gotta
stand up for himself.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.110
If these other kids are gonna--

10:12.112 --> 10:14.479
- No, he can't hit
other kids, he can't,

10:14.481 --> 10:16.648
it's not the way
the world works.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.316
- It is the way the world works.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.886
But he can't hit other
kids and stay at the school

10:22.723 --> 10:24.789
and we need this school.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.593
- So what do we do now?

10:31.865 --> 10:36.935
So, no video games, no
movies, no TV, no apps, okay?

10:37.371 --> 10:38.436
- For how long?

10:38.438 --> 10:40.171
- [Evelyn] We're gonna
start with two weeks.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.073
- That's forever.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.192
- [Red] You'll live.

10:44.193 --> 10:46.310
- And if we don't see
improvement, it could be longer.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.113
- That's not fair.

10:48.114 --> 10:49.914
- You know what's not fair
is us making the sacrifices,

10:49.916 --> 10:51.516
that we're making for
you to go to that school

10:51.518 --> 10:53.918
and then you not following
simple rules.

10:53.920 --> 10:57.022
- So you're grounded, it's
gonna be homework and chores,

10:57.024 --> 11:01.559
you can still play outside and
draw and play with your cars,

11:01.561 --> 11:03.561
but your councilor and
the principal think,

11:03.563 --> 11:06.531
that too much screen time
is having a negative effect.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.333
- Can I have my
cars in class, just once?

11:08.335 --> 11:10.235
- No, buddy, no cars in class.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.905
We do have some
good news, though.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.408
- You shouldn't think
of this as a reward,

11:16.410 --> 11:17.709
because you are grounded.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.479
- The councilor thinks you need
to spend some time outside,

11:21.481 --> 11:25.216
burn off some energy, so we're
gonna go for a hike tomorrow.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.718
- A hike, in the woods?

11:26.720 --> 11:30.088
- Yeah, we're gonna go to the
state park and take a hike,

11:30.090 --> 11:31.923
and have a picnic on--

11:31.925 --> 11:33.825
- Can I bring my binoculars,

11:33.827 --> 11:35.126
can I bring my magnifying glass?

11:35.128 --> 11:36.728
- Yeah, you can bring whatever
you want,

11:36.730 --> 11:38.897
load up your backpack, but
we can't get too excited,

11:38.899 --> 11:40.031
we gotta go to sleep tonight.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.417
- I can't wait, I can't
wait, I can't wait.

11:42.418 --> 11:44.802
- Okay, okay, get
under the covers,

11:44.805 --> 11:46.604
you need to get some
sleep, if you're gonna run

11:46.606 --> 11:48.173
all over the forest tomorrow.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.709
- Goodnight, buddy.

11:50.711 --> 11:51.676
- Goodnight, baby.

11:52.546 --> 11:55.046
(hinges creaking)

11:55.048 --> 11:57.682
- Get up, get up, get up,
get up, get up, get up.

11:57.684 --> 11:59.117
- Looks who's up.
- Get up, get up, get up!

11:59.119 --> 12:03.521
- Usually, your mom has to drag
you out of bed by the ears.

12:04.524 --> 12:05.523
- I'll start breakfast,

12:05.525 --> 12:07.258
if you could make
sandwiches for lunch.

12:07.260 --> 12:10.729
- I need big pieces of bread
to make a king sandwich

12:10.731 --> 12:11.896
for the bears.

12:11.898 --> 12:12.764
- There's bears?

12:12.766 --> 12:14.032
- [Evelyn] There aren't any
bears.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.467
- There's definitely bears,
there's definitely bears

12:17.537 --> 12:19.104
and they're gonna get you.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.840
(ominous music)

12:30.784 --> 12:33.284
No way.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.385
- They'll look fantastic.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.821
- (laughs) No, they would not.

12:36.823 --> 12:40.024
- Come on, beaded curtains
are huge right now.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.526
- Sure they are (laughs).

12:41.528 --> 12:44.829
- What , we need something
at the end of the hall.

12:44.831 --> 12:47.832
That rent house,
it looks like a condo.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.237
- That's what was available.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.404
- I'm not complaining.

12:55.175 --> 12:58.877
I'm grateful we were
able to find something.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.679
(birds chirping)

13:09.156 --> 13:12.290
- We're ready to
have the talk again.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.259
- About?

13:16.530 --> 13:17.595
- What if it helped?

13:19.900 --> 13:22.066
- I'm not stuffing him full of
pills, Red.

13:23.270 --> 13:26.437
- I'm not talking about
pouring meds down his neck,

13:26.439 --> 13:28.406
don't frame it
like that, I'm just,

13:31.011 --> 13:36.080
I'm just asking, if we need
to carefully and thoroughly--

13:36.416 --> 13:37.615
- It's a quick fix.

13:39.186 --> 13:44.255
The side effects, the months
it takes to dial in the dosage.

13:44.457 --> 13:48.660
- I just wanna make sure, that
we are open to every option,

13:48.662 --> 13:49.928
that might help him.

13:49.930 --> 13:50.762
- I'm open.

13:50.764 --> 13:52.163
(piano music)

13:52.165 --> 13:54.032
I never stopped researching.

13:55.268 --> 13:58.369
I'm not hung up on vaccines,
I'm not that person.

14:00.874 --> 14:05.043
I just haven't seen anything,
that makes me believe

14:05.045 --> 14:07.245
a pill is the answer.

14:07.247 --> 14:10.248
(piano music)

14:10.250 --> 14:13.518
(birds chirping)

14:13.520 --> 14:14.485
- Okay.

14:14.487 --> 14:15.920
- Okay.

14:15.922 --> 14:18.489
(piano music)

14:27.067 --> 14:28.099
- What is it?

14:32.806 --> 14:37.141
- Kane, come here, come here,
come here, be quiet, be quiet.

14:37.143 --> 14:38.877
- [Kane] What is it?

14:40.580 --> 14:43.381
- I think it might
be a bear, a bear!

14:45.552 --> 14:47.886
(laughing)

14:56.730 --> 14:58.997
I got you a little something.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.498
- For?

15:00.500 --> 15:05.536
- For being great, about the
move and all the sacrifices

15:05.872 --> 15:07.405
you're making for your family.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.208
I know the house isn't
what you had envisioned,

15:10.210 --> 15:12.210
when we made
our fresh start, but--

15:12.212 --> 15:15.146
- Is it a sack of
diamonds. Is it diamonds,

15:15.148 --> 15:17.749
did you get me a potato
sack full of diamonds.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.517
- Well, it's not in a sack.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.397
- My own online store.

15:32.399 --> 15:35.433
- I bought the URL and I
set up a simple website,

15:35.435 --> 15:37.969
it connects to all the crafty
sites.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.371
- My God.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.772
- I mean it's not finished,
but it'll take payments

15:40.774 --> 15:41.940
and everything.

15:41.942 --> 15:42.840
- This,

15:44.811 --> 15:46.644
this is so great.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.512
- Do you like it?

15:47.514 --> 15:49.881
- Yes, thank you, thank you.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.118
- I wish I could do more.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.955
(birds chirping)

16:05.432 --> 16:06.764
- Where is Kane?

16:06.766 --> 16:09.500
(ominous music)

16:20.180 --> 16:21.212
- It's door.

16:21.214 --> 16:24.415
- I see it's a door,
it's a really cool door.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.117
- Cool.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.088
- Yes, vintage, weathered.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.590
- It's creepy.

16:34.060 --> 16:35.326
- Every antique has a story

16:35.328 --> 16:36.828
and you always
assume it's creepy.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.564
- This is creepy, what,
someone left a door out here?

16:39.566 --> 16:41.966
- I don't know, people dump
treasures all the time,

16:41.968 --> 16:44.936
look, they even left the key.

16:44.938 --> 16:47.238
It's just waiting for us.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.074
All it needs is to be refinished

16:50.076 --> 16:51.642
with a little love and care.

16:52.946 --> 16:54.546
- Are you serious?

16:54.547 --> 16:56.147
- Yeah, you see creepy,
I see potential, Red,

16:56.149 --> 16:58.816
it even looks, like it's the
right size.

16:58.818 --> 17:02.053
- I love your creative
vision, but I do not see it.

17:02.055 --> 17:05.022
- I always see the potential,
it's why I married you.

17:05.959 --> 17:10.028
Look, it's not a beaded curtain
and if the house is finished

17:10.030 --> 17:11.996
then I can focus my full
attention on getting

17:11.998 --> 17:13.664
the online store up and running.

17:16.435 --> 17:19.470
- I'll go get the truck,
I'm not hauling that thing.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.772
- You're the bestest,
strongest husband ever.

17:24.944 --> 17:27.244
(laughing)

17:30.583 --> 17:33.418
(sander buzzing)

17:49.102 --> 17:50.735
- Thank you, honey.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.239
Well poured.

18:10.957 --> 18:13.691
(drill buzzing)

18:25.538 --> 18:27.371
Works and everything.

18:54.300 --> 18:57.101
(hinge creaking)

19:11.117 --> 19:13.851
(ominous music)

19:20.793 --> 19:24.028
(children chattering)

19:45.618 --> 19:48.920
Hey, you have a
late night snack?

19:48.922 --> 19:50.021
- No, not me.

19:50.023 --> 19:53.324
- Oh, he's sleep walking again.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.659
- [Red] And sleep eating?

19:54.661 --> 19:57.562
- Didn't even bother heating
it up, just munched on it cold.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.598
- I got to go to work early to
make up

20:00.600 --> 20:02.967
for that half day on Friday,
can you take Kane to school?

20:02.969 --> 20:05.303
- Sure, sure, you
don't want any bacon?

20:05.305 --> 20:06.437
- Nah.

20:06.439 --> 20:07.638
- Or a waffle?

20:08.741 --> 20:11.142
- No, I'm good, love you.

20:11.144 --> 20:12.210
- Love you too.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.383
- I'm so sleepy.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.384
- Yeah, I figured, do you
remember getting up last night?

20:21.387 --> 20:23.704
- [Kane] No.

20:23.705 --> 20:26.022
- Well, eat fast,
we're gonna be late.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.159
Oh, Kane, you've
got to comb your hair.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.629
- We're out of milk.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.298
- I'll pick some up after
I take you to school, eat.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.310
Kane, did you leave some
food in the jacket pocket

20:46.312 --> 20:48.045
or something, the closet reeks.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.981
- No.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.916
- Well, then it's shoes, gross,
you done?

20:53.953 --> 20:55.419
Get your backpack, let's go.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.864
(ominous music)

21:13.773 --> 21:18.843
Kane, oh, I'm gonna
skin you alive, oh, God.

21:23.616 --> 21:24.582
- Yes, yes.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.618
- Kane swears he didn't do it.

21:28.821 --> 21:31.088
- Well, maybe they
crawled in from the vent.

21:32.125 --> 21:37.194
- Red, it was full, full,
they didn't climb in there.

21:40.233 --> 21:44.001
- I'll talk to him, but maybe
you want me to put some traps

21:44.003 --> 21:45.169
in there just in case?

21:46.472 --> 21:50.074
- Sure, put some traps in there,
see if they catch anything.

21:50.076 --> 21:53.878
- [Announcer] 35, 40, what
a block, 45, still going--

21:53.880 --> 21:55.613
- And talk to Kane.

21:55.615 --> 21:56.714
- Yeah, what?

21:56.716 --> 21:59.417
- [Announcer] This game is
really getting.

21:59.419 --> 22:02.053
(horror music)

22:03.990 --> 22:07.258
- I can't sleep,
I'm having bad dreams.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.060
- You okay?

22:09.062 --> 22:10.795
- Yeah, it's nothing, I just.

22:13.499 --> 22:16.133
- I'm walking through a
house with lots of rooms

22:16.135 --> 22:17.268
and it's following me.

22:17.270 --> 22:18.903
- It?

22:18.905 --> 22:20.304
- The bad thing.

22:22.175 --> 22:24.342
- What's the bad thing?

22:24.343 --> 22:26.510
- I don't know, it's just a
bad thing, it wants to get me.

22:26.512 --> 22:27.712
- A monster?

22:28.881 --> 22:30.014
- You okay, buddy?

22:31.351 --> 22:33.384
You know, we're
right across the hall,

22:33.386 --> 22:34.785
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

22:34.787 --> 22:35.820
- I know.

22:37.690 --> 22:41.058
- You know, there's no such
thing as monster, right?

22:41.060 --> 22:41.892
- Yeah.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.060
- [Evelyn] They aren't real.

22:43.062 --> 22:46.497
- I don't believe in monsters,
but I'm scared of them.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.866
- Well, can you think of happy
things,

22:48.868 --> 22:53.938
like taking a hike or a cool
bug, or driving a fast car?

22:56.642 --> 22:59.343
- I try to think of happy
things, but every time I close

22:59.345 --> 23:01.345
my eyes I see the bad thing.

23:02.749 --> 23:05.216
- Well, can you think of
anything, that can make you
think

23:05.218 --> 23:06.751
of good things?

23:06.753 --> 23:07.752
- Grandma's prayer.

23:08.888 --> 23:09.787
- Okay.

23:09.789 --> 23:15.659
Our father, who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name,

23:16.729 --> 23:21.499
thy kingdom come, thy
will be done, on earth,

23:21.501 --> 23:26.470
as it is in heaven, give
us this day our daily bread

23:27.306 --> 23:30.708
and forgive us our sins,
as we forgive those,

23:30.710 --> 23:32.476
who sin against us.

23:34.247 --> 23:38.315
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil,

23:39.218 --> 23:44.288
for thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory,

23:44.424 --> 23:46.157
forever and ever.

23:46.159 --> 23:49.393
(horror violin music)

23:53.833 --> 23:54.732
Amen.

24:07.613 --> 24:11.315
(children chattering)

24:11.317 --> 24:13.617
(knocking)

24:15.688 --> 24:19.590
- Hi, this is no longer a safe
place,

24:19.592 --> 24:21.559
this house has changed.

24:22.562 --> 24:23.994
- Come inside.

24:23.996 --> 24:24.895
- Thank you.

24:27.567 --> 24:28.466
- What's wrong?

24:29.402 --> 24:32.970
- I'm not sure, but
this house, it unclean,

24:32.972 --> 24:35.039
it afflicted by spirits.

24:36.108 --> 24:41.145
Dark phantoms haunted by
the trinity of the veil.

24:42.782 --> 24:47.852
- My house is haunted, no,
the evil has an invitation,

24:49.121 --> 24:51.388
someone brought it here.

24:52.792 --> 24:55.759
- What, we invited an evil
spirit?

24:55.761 --> 25:00.831
Okay, I believe in psychic
ability and the tarot,

25:02.602 --> 25:05.269
but ghosts, isn't it a little?

25:05.271 --> 25:09.707
- You cannot believe in
only half of the next world.

25:11.377 --> 25:16.380
I sense malice
from the other side.

25:17.450 --> 25:18.782
- Okay.

25:18.784 --> 25:21.085
- We must bless this house.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.623
(ominous music)

26:39.265 --> 26:41.966
Where did you get this door?

26:42.868 --> 26:45.603
(ominous music)

27:17.670 --> 27:19.837
Okay, all done.

27:26.879 --> 27:30.214
Understand, there are no
guarantees.

27:30.216 --> 27:32.516
- I understand, yeah.

27:32.518 --> 27:36.186
- You should remove
this door, burn it.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.423
- Okay, I'll talk to Red.

27:40.426 --> 27:43.494
- Be careful,
be careful with things

27:43.496 --> 27:45.929
you bring into this house.

27:52.405 --> 27:54.505
- Second one,
what is with these bits.

27:54.507 --> 27:55.839
- Not coming out?

27:55.841 --> 27:58.409
- No, it won't budge
and these pins,

27:58.411 --> 28:00.310
they're stuck in here,
I can't knock them out.

28:00.312 --> 28:02.513
- Well, how are we
gonna get it out then?

28:02.515 --> 28:04.048
- I don't know, sledge hammer?

28:05.084 --> 28:06.850
Honey, this isn't
a one night job.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.019
- But I want it gone.

28:15.594 --> 28:18.328
- You begged for this
door and now one word

28:18.330 --> 28:20.297
from your psychic friend, who,
by the way,

28:20.299 --> 28:22.900
may have visited here today
and you wanna pull it?

28:24.203 --> 28:26.003
You love this door, you
said it was perfect.

28:26.005 --> 28:27.071
- I know.

28:27.073 --> 28:28.706
- I thought it
was creepy, you said no,

28:28.708 --> 28:29.707
he says it's creepy--

28:29.709 --> 28:30.808
- I know.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.943
- You sure you're not
overreacting?

28:34.413 --> 28:36.380
- You always say I'm
overreacting.

28:38.517 --> 28:39.416
- Well.

28:39.418 --> 28:45.289
- Okay, well, he cleared the
house, so maybe we're good.

28:45.558 --> 28:48.592
- I'm sure that did
it, clearing the house.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.996
Honey, I will get to it, I
just can't do it tonight.

28:52.998 --> 28:57.868
- Fine, we'll just keep it
till the weekend and see.

29:00.806 --> 29:05.876
- Maybe on the weekend you
can get a nice beaded curtain.

29:07.379 --> 29:09.680
(laughing)

29:23.596 --> 29:24.428
- [Woman] How can I help you?

29:24.430 --> 29:26.363
- Hi, I'm new to town and--

29:26.365 --> 29:28.532
- And you need a library card.

29:28.534 --> 29:33.604
- No, I mean yes, but,
actually, I'm looking for

29:33.873 --> 29:37.975
reference material for any
local stories or legends about,

29:40.312 --> 29:42.312
about the supernatural stuff.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.982
- Oh, local haunts and ghost
stories?

29:44.984 --> 29:46.717
- Yes, exactly.

29:46.718 --> 29:48.451
- There's a local interest
section, there might be

29:48.454 --> 29:50.420
some books there you'd be
interested in.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.256
Ghost stories,
old haunts or was there

29:52.258 --> 29:54.358
something in particular?

29:54.360 --> 29:56.426
- You know, I don't really
know where to start,

29:56.428 --> 29:58.095
do you have any ideas?

29:58.097 --> 30:01.265
- There are some more recent
things, can still talk about

30:01.267 --> 30:05.035
the haunted bridge down
Morris road, a spooky well

30:05.037 --> 30:08.105
and there is the vanishing
children.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.274
- The children.

30:10.276 --> 30:13.577
- Oh, yeah, for decades,
this town has been known

30:13.579 --> 30:17.881
for children being, well,
taken, come with me.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.886
(ominous music)

30:34.066 --> 30:36.667
That's it, she was the last one.

30:36.669 --> 30:41.238
- Maggie Bradford, this
is over 20 years ago.

30:41.240 --> 30:44.608
- And they stopped after
her, the vanishings,

30:44.610 --> 30:48.579
they go way back before that,
at least a couple a year.

30:48.581 --> 30:51.014
There were some arrests,
but no convictions.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.517
- And no one every found them?

30:53.519 --> 30:55.118
- Not a one.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.855
(ominous music)

31:02.494 --> 31:05.829
- Some decaffeinated
sleepy time tea.

31:11.370 --> 31:12.469
What's going on?

31:16.108 --> 31:19.776
- I went to the library
today to do some research.

31:19.778 --> 31:20.711
- About the door.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.114
- Yeah.

31:27.720 --> 31:28.986
- Did you find anything?

31:30.556 --> 31:32.456
- Yes, some stuff
about missing children,

31:36.562 --> 31:37.945
who were never found.

31:37.946 --> 31:39.329
- You know, every town has
missing children stories.

31:39.331 --> 31:42.833
- This is a lot of children,
over a long time, Red,

31:43.802 --> 31:45.035
it's unnerving.

31:46.205 --> 31:49.806
- Well, you know,
you can get unnerved,

31:49.808 --> 31:53.243
when children are in
danger and especially Kane.

31:55.047 --> 31:58.015
And I think it's because it
was so much work having him.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.084
I mean it wasn't so much work,

32:01.086 --> 32:05.355
but we were very lucky.

32:05.357 --> 32:07.190
- We were so lucky, you know.

32:09.161 --> 32:14.264
- And the stress of moving
and your psychic buddy

32:14.266 --> 32:17.801
throwing fuel on the fire, I
think you're getting caught up

32:17.803 --> 32:19.069
in creepy stories.

32:22.241 --> 32:24.441
How are we supposed to tell
Kane there's no such thing

32:24.443 --> 32:26.643
as ghosts, when mommy's
jumping in shadows?

32:29.682 --> 32:31.214
- Yeah, I know, you're right.

32:37.122 --> 32:39.856
(alarm beeping)

32:46.432 --> 32:47.564
Good morning.

32:52.104 --> 32:55.839
I forgot to set the timer on
the coffee maker last night.

32:55.841 --> 32:57.240
- I did it.

32:57.242 --> 33:01.945
- Oh, my hero, you want eggs?

33:02.848 --> 33:04.915
- I gotta stick
with toast and coffee.

33:06.452 --> 33:10.087
- Yeah, but you like
eggs, I don't mind it.

33:13.225 --> 33:14.124
- My hero.

33:17.930 --> 33:22.699
If you get Kane ready for
school, I'll take him.

33:30.576 --> 33:31.475
Evelyn.

33:33.012 --> 33:33.910
- Yeah?

33:34.880 --> 33:37.414
- [Red] Can you take
a look at this?

33:37.416 --> 33:40.150
(ominous music)

33:50.396 --> 33:53.964
Maybe this weekend
we get a new door.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.454
(ominous music)

35:36.735 --> 35:39.469
(phone ringing)

35:43.375 --> 35:44.274
- Oh, no.

35:45.844 --> 35:49.379
- As you know, this is
not out first incident.

35:50.315 --> 35:53.083
As accommodating
as this school may be,

35:53.085 --> 35:56.853
we have a zero tolerance
policy for violence.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.689
- [Red] We know and--

35:58.690 --> 36:00.524
- [Raleigh] I've talked
to several other families

36:00.526 --> 36:03.260
and while I don't
excuse their behavior.

36:10.169 --> 36:13.403
(children chattering)

36:23.749 --> 36:25.782
- [Evelyn] How can they just
kick him out?

36:25.784 --> 36:26.616
- [Red] It's a private school,

36:26.618 --> 36:27.984
they can do whatever they want.

36:27.986 --> 36:29.753
- [Evelyn] That school was
built for special kids,

36:29.755 --> 36:31.555
kids with needs like Kane's,
to kick him out, it's--

36:31.557 --> 36:34.357
- It's not fair, it's not
right and it's what happened.

36:36.795 --> 36:39.329
On Monday I'll go talk
to the principal Raleigh,

36:39.331 --> 36:41.631
maybe she'll be in a
different frame of mind.

36:42.601 --> 36:45.068
But as it is, we gotta start
looking for a new school.

36:46.171 --> 36:49.039
- I'll call the tutor the
councilor recommended.

36:49.041 --> 36:50.574
Maybe he won't
fall too far behind,

36:50.576 --> 36:51.741
while he's out of class.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.009
- How much does the tutor cost?

36:53.011 --> 36:54.177
- It's not cheap.

36:54.179 --> 36:55.078
- [Red] Great.

36:56.748 --> 37:00.650
- I'll get a job, the
online business can wait.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.954
- It may have to, you
know the contract I signed

37:03.956 --> 37:05.422
with the school about trading
renovations

37:05.424 --> 37:07.857
for Kane's tuition, well,
now, that Kane's no longer

37:07.859 --> 37:12.329
at school I get a cash
payment, a low cash payment.

37:12.331 --> 37:13.663
- How low?

37:13.665 --> 37:14.564
- [Red] Low.

37:15.734 --> 37:18.435
- How are we gonna be
able to pay the bills?

37:18.437 --> 37:19.970
- We'll figure something out.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.574
Important thing is we
get him back at school.

37:25.978 --> 37:27.110
- But how do we even--

37:27.112 --> 37:29.813
- Punish him?

37:29.814 --> 37:32.515
- Do we, I mean those other
kids, those kids push him

37:32.517 --> 37:35.085
and then he's already grounded.

37:35.087 --> 37:37.387
- I'll take him to
work with me tomorrow.

37:37.389 --> 37:39.089
It's Saturday,
nobody will be at school,

37:39.091 --> 37:41.558
he can do his math work
book and his reading.

37:42.361 --> 37:45.495
He stays here, it'll be
too much like vacation.

37:45.497 --> 37:46.329
- You're a good dad.

37:46.331 --> 37:47.330
- You're a great mom.

37:49.534 --> 37:50.967
- We'll figure it out.

37:50.969 --> 37:52.302
- We always do.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.487
- Okay, be good
for your dad today,

38:10.489 --> 38:12.088
don't distract him from work.

38:12.090 --> 38:13.223
- Okay.
- Okay.

38:14.426 --> 38:15.358
Bye.

38:15.360 --> 38:16.359
- Love you.

38:17.429 --> 38:18.995
- Have a good day.

38:21.066 --> 38:23.633
(piano music)

38:36.381 --> 38:39.182
(dramatic music)

39:19.691 --> 39:22.025
(knocking)

39:22.027 --> 39:24.861
(birds chirping)

39:29.901 --> 39:33.670
Hello, my name's Evelyn Eden
and I was just wondering

39:33.672 --> 39:37.140
and I know this sounds
odd, but I was wondering,

39:37.142 --> 39:39.275
if you had any information
about the old house,

39:39.277 --> 39:42.345
that used to be in the
clearing, the one, that burned.

39:42.347 --> 39:43.847
- What about it?

39:43.849 --> 39:45.682
- I was just looking for anyone
with any

39:45.684 --> 39:50.754
information about it, I
wanted to, there was a door.

39:51.423 --> 39:55.058
- You're the one,
who took the door.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.560
- What do you know
about that door?

39:57.562 --> 39:58.461
- Everything.

40:00.799 --> 40:02.499
You made a terrible mistake.

40:06.671 --> 40:08.805
- Okay, eat your lunch,
do your math, read,

40:08.807 --> 40:10.306
no TV, no games, okay?

40:10.308 --> 40:11.508
- Okay.

40:11.509 --> 40:12.709
- I mean it, I'm just
running to the lumber yard

40:12.711 --> 40:14.344
and I'll be right back, lock the
door.

40:14.346 --> 40:16.679
- I know, lock the door, keep my
phone on,

40:16.681 --> 40:19.682
do not open the door
until when you're home.

40:19.684 --> 40:22.185
- You got it, no games.

40:22.187 --> 40:23.219
- [Kane] I know.

40:24.589 --> 40:29.626
- My daughter Maggie vanished,
just like all the others.

40:31.763 --> 40:36.599
No clues, no demands, no leads,
just gone.

40:36.601 --> 40:39.569
- [Evelyn] Maggie, Maggie
Bradford,

40:40.972 --> 40:42.739
your daughter was the last
victim.

40:44.543 --> 40:47.177
- I knew it was that damn house.

40:47.179 --> 40:49.979
(crows chirping)

40:52.250 --> 40:54.484
- Who lived there?

40:54.486 --> 40:55.385
- No one.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.924
House has been
abandoned for years.

41:02.527 --> 41:04.594
But every story
about a missing kid

41:05.464 --> 41:06.796
led up to that house.

41:08.667 --> 41:12.635
I started thinking there's
something wrong with the house,

41:13.538 --> 41:14.537
the house itself.

41:16.074 --> 41:17.941
- The house was
taking the children.

41:19.678 --> 41:22.545
- [Woman] I told her to
stay away from that house,

41:22.547 --> 41:27.617
I knew, knew, I was wrong and
I wasn't gonna let that house

41:30.689 --> 41:31.955
take another child.

41:34.593 --> 41:35.492
- You burned it.

41:37.562 --> 41:39.662
- I took eight gallons of
kerosene

41:45.837 --> 41:49.739
and I burned it to the ground,
all of it.

41:51.409 --> 41:56.446
Except the door,
it wouldn't burn.

41:57.215 --> 41:59.949
(ominous music)

42:24.242 --> 42:27.877
So I took two more gallons
of gas and I lit it up.

42:30.015 --> 42:33.683
But that door wouldn't
burn, so I buried it

42:36.488 --> 42:39.489
and I buried that door
eight feet underground,

42:40.725 --> 42:42.525
and I threw the key in the pond.

42:46.231 --> 42:47.063
- So why was it--

42:47.065 --> 42:48.698
- I went back the next day

42:51.836 --> 42:53.870
and that door was standing in
its place

42:55.540 --> 42:59.375
straight up like an oak,
like it had grown there

42:59.377 --> 43:04.247
out of the ground, key and
lock, so I wrapped it in chains.

43:05.116 --> 43:09.786
And I fastened that key in the
lock, and I left it to rot.

43:11.623 --> 43:13.856
- And the children stopped
vanishing.

43:13.858 --> 43:14.958
- For 20 years,

43:16.428 --> 43:18.595
but then you took the door.

43:26.571 --> 43:27.837
- We took off the chain.

43:30.942 --> 43:33.509
- You let it loose, Ms. Eden.

43:33.511 --> 43:36.245
- What is it, Missis Bradford,
what is behind that door?

43:36.247 --> 43:40.883
- I don't know,
but it takes children

43:42.787 --> 43:44.554
and it doesn't give them back.

43:47.826 --> 43:49.092
I don't know what it is,

43:52.530 --> 43:56.099
but it's a very bad thing.

43:56.101 --> 43:58.835
(phone ringing)

44:01.206 --> 44:04.040
- I need to go, thank you.

44:04.042 --> 44:06.509
- [Ms. Bradford] Get rid
of that door, Ms. Eden.

44:21.893 --> 44:24.894
- Kane, Kane, honey,
open the door.

44:26.831 --> 44:27.930
(knocking)

44:27.932 --> 44:29.098
Kane, honey, open the door.

44:29.100 --> 44:29.999
- What's going on?

44:30.001 --> 44:31.634
- [Evelyn] Kane!

44:31.635 --> 44:33.268
- What's wrong, oh my God, I
got it, I got it, I got it.

44:33.271 --> 44:36.639
- Kane, open the door,
Kane, where are you?

44:36.641 --> 44:39.108
- Kane, Kane!
- Kane!

44:39.110 --> 44:40.009
Kane!

44:42.347 --> 44:43.212
- Kane!

44:45.750 --> 44:46.616
Kane!

44:48.953 --> 44:51.921
- [Evelyn] He's gone, he's gone.

44:51.923 --> 44:54.590
- [Red] Kane, Kane, Kane, Kane!

44:57.295 --> 45:00.530
(children chattering)

45:34.199 --> 45:36.833
(string music)

45:49.047 --> 45:51.981
- [Red] You know every town
has missing children stories.

45:51.983 --> 45:55.151
- [Juryah] Open them, any
time you open a new door--

45:55.153 --> 45:56.786
- [Red] How are we
supposed to tell Kane

45:56.788 --> 45:57.854
there's no such thing as ghosts,

45:57.856 --> 45:59.355
if mommy's jumping in shadows?

45:59.357 --> 46:02.258
- [Juryah] Other side of the
wall.

46:25.950 --> 46:28.117
(crying)

46:33.391 --> 46:35.224
- I know, I know.

46:35.226 --> 46:37.894
(string music)

47:00.652 --> 47:04.887
- Where's my phone, I need to
make a call.

47:04.889 --> 47:06.355
- Gonna call your mom again?

47:07.826 --> 47:08.724
- No.

47:10.695 --> 47:12.862
I'm gonna call an expert.

47:13.865 --> 47:14.764
- Who?

47:16.201 --> 47:21.270
- Don't try to talk me
down, you left him here.

47:24.742 --> 47:26.542
Tried to make me think I was,

47:29.647 --> 47:33.282
you made me think I
was crazy, but I'm not.

47:37.589 --> 47:40.056
I know what happened to Kane.

47:42.227 --> 47:45.962
I'm gonna do anything
I can to get him back.

47:47.332 --> 47:48.497
Now where's my phone?

47:51.903 --> 47:56.973
- We may be able to get Kane
back, but we must move quickly.

48:04.749 --> 48:09.819
I can hear the other side
and they can hear me.

48:11.556 --> 48:16.459
We may be able to make a
bargain for your son's return.

48:18.763 --> 48:19.729
- How do we do it?

48:21.332 --> 48:25.368
- It will be difficult,
it will be frightening,

48:25.370 --> 48:30.439
we will hold a ceremony,
not here, the place,

48:30.808 --> 48:31.941
where you found it.

48:33.778 --> 48:34.677
- Yeah.

48:36.781 --> 48:37.780
- The place?

48:39.150 --> 48:41.450
Where it took Kane,

48:44.956 --> 48:45.855
what's it like?

48:47.325 --> 48:52.395
- This thing, this bad
thing, that took Kane,

48:54.599 --> 48:58.200
it is an ancient evil.

49:00.071 --> 49:05.141
We must not take it lightly,
we are going to battle.

49:06.778 --> 49:07.944
- What do we need?

49:11.082 --> 49:15.751
- I have the tools I
need, but bring the door.

49:25.797 --> 49:28.030
(beating)

49:36.007 --> 49:38.741
(ominous music)

50:18.082 --> 50:20.616
(owl hooting)

50:35.299 --> 50:39.568
Salt circle for protection.

50:42.340 --> 50:43.739
Don't break it.

50:45.176 --> 50:47.543
Try to stay inside of it.

50:47.545 --> 50:50.980
- What happens, if you
step outside of the circle?

50:50.982 --> 50:53.049
- Try to stay inside of it.

50:55.720 --> 51:00.790
Think of it as shield between
us and any angry spirits.

51:05.129 --> 51:09.799
- So the spirits will be angry?

51:10.635 --> 51:11.834
- Oh, yeah.

51:13.838 --> 51:17.473
You pull out the jars, water,
please.

52:21.939 --> 52:27.009
These are levels of spirits
between us and the one

52:28.980 --> 52:33.616
keeping Kane, gatekeepers,
sentries.

52:34.452 --> 52:39.355
We will go deep through many
levels,

52:39.357 --> 52:44.260
each level have different
techniques and rituals.

52:45.830 --> 52:50.332
You must agree to
follow my directions.

52:51.469 --> 52:54.803
Completely and without
hesitation.

52:54.805 --> 52:55.704
- Of course.

52:56.874 --> 53:01.944
- You may hear things, you
may see things, you may,

53:03.347 --> 53:08.417
no matter what happen here
tonight, focus on the goal.

53:08.586 --> 53:12.855
Don't be shaken, don't be
distracted.

53:16.494 --> 53:21.564
Don't let hope to fear, bring
Kane home.

53:26.771 --> 53:28.003
Close your eyes.

53:30.308 --> 53:34.176
If you hear bell ringing,
squeeze my hands.

53:39.483 --> 53:42.518
We need to speak
with other spirits

53:46.023 --> 53:51.093
beyond the veil and grant us
the passage to the other side.

53:56.067 --> 54:00.836
Spirit of the veil,
are you there?

54:03.441 --> 54:06.442
Spirit haunting the veil, are
you there?

54:09.981 --> 54:12.615
(bell ringing)

54:14.151 --> 54:19.221
We have returned the
door to its right place,

54:20.992 --> 54:24.960
as tool of a good faith.

54:27.331 --> 54:29.832
Do you sense the door?

54:30.968 --> 54:33.869
(bell ringing)

54:33.871 --> 54:37.740
- Keep your eyes
closed, just do it.

54:37.742 --> 54:40.242
- We have to force a little bit.

54:41.646 --> 54:43.279
Hold my hand tightly, okay.

54:48.986 --> 54:51.720
(bells ringing)

55:01.532 --> 55:03.799
Pray, pray, pray, pray.

55:09.006 --> 55:10.839
(children chattering)

55:10.841 --> 55:13.575
(bells ringing)

55:36.634 --> 55:37.533
- Jesus.

55:39.603 --> 55:42.338
(ominous music)

56:31.722 --> 56:33.622
We are beyond now.

56:33.624 --> 56:34.523
- Beyond?

56:35.860 --> 56:39.895
- The veil, we need some
help from other spirits,

56:43.901 --> 56:48.971
the totem for allowing them
to answer my questions.

56:53.811 --> 56:55.043
One knock yes,

57:00.284 --> 57:01.283
two knocks,

57:04.622 --> 57:05.487
no.

57:10.461 --> 57:13.595
Spirit, are you there?

57:20.237 --> 57:25.307
Spirit, answer me,
are you there?

57:29.780 --> 57:32.815
Are you light spirit?

57:38.422 --> 57:43.492
If you truly dark spirit, then
you know

57:46.163 --> 57:50.599
I can speak on the other side.

57:52.736 --> 57:55.337
Do you know who I am?

58:00.010 --> 58:03.378
Then you know what I can do.

58:06.183 --> 58:11.353
We are looking for a boy
from the side of living,

58:11.355 --> 58:13.489
have you sensed him?

58:15.559 --> 58:17.159
Will you help us?

58:19.830 --> 58:24.900
I can compel you, I
command you to assist us.

58:27.438 --> 58:29.204
I command you to.

58:29.206 --> 58:31.440
(banging)

58:40.618 --> 58:44.286
- Oh my God, they're not
gonna help us, are they?

58:44.288 --> 58:45.854
- You're not done.

58:59.069 --> 59:00.168
Do you hear that?

59:00.170 --> 59:01.570
- Yeah, I think,

59:04.108 --> 59:06.074
wait, do you hear that?

59:07.244 --> 59:08.143
- Yeah.

59:09.113 --> 59:11.847
(ominous music)

59:41.345 --> 59:44.479
- He is in the darkest place,
he is in the darkest place,

59:44.481 --> 59:47.683
he is in the darkest place,
he is in the darkest place,

59:47.685 --> 59:50.819
he is in the darkest place,
he is in the darkest place.

59:50.821 --> 59:54.489
He is in the darkest place,
he is in the darkest place,

59:54.491 --> 59:59.561
he is in the darkest place.

01:00:13.811 --> 01:00:16.778
- Place your hands on the toy.

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:22.317
Keep your pressure light,
feather light.

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:27.122
Don't attempt to move
the car, just let it move

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:29.324
and let your hands follow it.

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:36.765
Are there spirits
willing to speak with us,

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:43.038
a willing spirit, any spirit
willing to speak with us?

01:00:48.779 --> 01:00:53.515
We are looking for a
boy, a living boy,

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:58.353
that was taken to the
other side tonight.

01:00:59.256 --> 01:01:01.990
(ominous music)

01:01:07.297 --> 01:01:08.196
- Oh, my God.

01:01:10.634 --> 01:01:15.704
- Yes, he is called Kane,
do you know where he is?

01:01:21.378 --> 01:01:23.111
Tell us where he is.

01:01:25.215 --> 01:01:29.017
You will, you will tell
us where Kane is.

01:01:30.621 --> 01:01:33.355
(ominous music)

01:01:45.803 --> 01:01:49.838
Where is the boy, where is Kane?

01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:03.318
Who's got the boy?

01:02:13.931 --> 01:02:15.964
Oh, shit, I need his name.

01:02:18.502 --> 01:02:23.305
In the power of light, I
compel you, give me his name.

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:29.077
(terrifying music)

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:47.929
Damn it.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:50.699
- What now?

01:02:56.173 --> 01:02:58.907
(ominous music)

01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:07.749
- I need to channel
with the gatekeeper.

01:03:10.554 --> 01:03:12.721
I can't do that
without his name.

01:03:12.723 --> 01:03:14.556
- Can you try again?

01:03:16.226 --> 01:03:21.263
- I only had one board, I've
never seen them do this to one.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:27.002
- If you had another, could
they destroy that one too.

01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:30.906
- I need enhancement
to protect it.

01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:36.144
I never thought I...

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:39.881
(ominous music)

01:03:58.802 --> 01:03:59.701
- Do it.

01:04:03.407 --> 01:04:08.243
- Spirits, give me the
name of the gatekeeper,

01:04:08.245 --> 01:04:13.315
the powers of light, I
compel you, give me her name.

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:20.188
(ominous music)

01:04:37.674 --> 01:04:38.573
- Empusa.

01:04:44.615 --> 01:04:45.814
So you have her name.

01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:50.485
- This is a powerful dark force.

01:04:52.256 --> 01:04:56.791
And the only gatekeeper to
whatever the mind intended

01:04:59.897 --> 01:05:01.296
has taken Kane.

01:05:01.298 --> 01:05:02.664
- Are you saying you can't?

01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:05.133
- No, no, no, he could do
it, you can do it, right?

01:05:05.135 --> 01:05:06.134
- I can.

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:08.069
- So what is it?

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:12.841
- I'm about to open a dark
doorway.

01:05:12.843 --> 01:05:15.710
- About to, what have
we been doing so far?

01:05:15.712 --> 01:05:20.749
- The next step is taxing,
difficult and dangerous.

01:05:25.656 --> 01:05:26.554
Please sit.

01:05:30.894 --> 01:05:31.793
Before we,

01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:37.799
before we open the dark
doorway to the next evil,

01:05:41.705 --> 01:05:46.341
I want you to know, I
believe Kane is alive,

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:51.613
with all my heart, I truly do.

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:54.449
- But?

01:05:56.186 --> 01:06:00.922
- But before we open the
door, I want to be sure,

01:06:02.659 --> 01:06:05.727
I want to try and talk to Kane.

01:06:08.365 --> 01:06:09.597
- We can talk?

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:13.902
- Possibly, yes, but
this is very disturbing.

01:06:18.842 --> 01:06:22.911
I want you to be
prepared and focused.

01:06:26.917 --> 01:06:28.350
- Okay, anything.

01:06:29.753 --> 01:06:32.821
- Bring pencils.

01:06:32.823 --> 01:06:35.557
(ominous music)

01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:52.307
- The Veil has then, I'm
speaking now to the living

01:06:54.244 --> 01:06:59.314
beyond the curtain, to
the living among the dead.

01:07:00.484 --> 01:07:07.255
I'm speaking to Kane
Eden, can you hear me?

01:07:10.427 --> 01:07:12.327
Kane, if you're there,

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:20.602
you can move it,
tell me you are there.

01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:30.111
Dark spirits, allow him
to speak to the living.

01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:39.654
To the side, stand aside,
I'm speaking to the living.

01:07:44.327 --> 01:07:47.562
Dark evil aside,
let the living speak!

01:07:50.267 --> 01:07:51.166
- Juryah.

01:07:57.307 --> 01:08:02.377
- I'm sorry, there are too
many dark spirits between us,

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:04.779
I can't.

01:08:07.451 --> 01:08:08.283
- But does that mean?

01:08:08.285 --> 01:08:09.951
- I believe Kane is alive.

01:08:14.624 --> 01:08:17.625
(terrifying music)

01:08:21.531 --> 01:08:23.865
(shouting)

01:08:32.642 --> 01:08:33.541
- Baby.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:37.045
(ominous music)

01:08:39.816 --> 01:08:41.950
- My baby, baby, my baby.

01:08:48.658 --> 01:08:52.660
- I was there,
I was where Kane is.

01:08:53.964 --> 01:08:56.698
(ominous music)

01:09:19.022 --> 01:09:23.491
- I am an open vessel, a
pie dish for the dark spirit

01:09:25.929 --> 01:09:28.162
called Empusa.

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:34.335
I summoned the gatekeeper
to speak to the dark spirits

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:39.174
beyond this door.

01:09:40.544 --> 01:09:45.813
Talk to me Empusa, allow me to
(grunts).

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:55.290
- [Empusa] I am Empusa,
I am the guardian

01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:57.325
of the gate to the void.

01:09:59.629 --> 01:10:04.666
- We seek an audience with
the entity behind the door.

01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:09.671
The one, that was taken,
named Kane.

01:10:12.609 --> 01:10:15.710
- [Empusa] You do not want
to speak to my master,

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:20.315
living one, he is the prince
of sorrows and suffering.

01:10:20.317 --> 01:10:23.518
He is glorious in his evil.

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:28.590
- We must speak with him,
he does not belong there.

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:31.693
- [Empusa] My master
would disagree,

01:10:32.629 --> 01:10:35.797
he'd rather shift the
pitiful wailings of the boy,

01:10:35.799 --> 01:10:37.865
I doubt he will give up his pet.

01:10:39.536 --> 01:10:44.606
- The boy's parents are
here, they are willing

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:48.376
to bargain with your master.

01:10:49.145 --> 01:10:52.547
- [Empusa] Bargain, what
pain could they bring,

01:10:52.549 --> 01:10:54.682
that would suffice in trade,

01:10:54.684 --> 01:10:57.218
what pain could they
offer as tribute?

01:10:58.555 --> 01:11:03.625
- Let us speak with your
master, is he afraid?

01:11:04.261 --> 01:11:07.395
- [Empusa] Afraid,
my master, he is fear

01:11:07.397 --> 01:11:09.130
formed into consciousness,
he sups on the beasts,

01:11:10.634 --> 01:11:13.234
that quake men's
homes, he is not afraid.

01:11:15.272 --> 01:11:18.740
- Then why not
let us speak with him?

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:23.578
Why not grant us
in our audience?

01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:28.283
We are afraid,

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:35.657
let him enjoy our
fear in his presence

01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:43.231
and no harm could come from
hearing and considering bargain.

01:11:45.735 --> 01:11:48.336
- [Empusa] The boy is so
important to you,

01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:52.473
that you would stand in the
feet of pain and terror,

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:55.877
and still have the loins
to offer a bargain?

01:11:55.879 --> 01:12:00.948
- Yes, yes, he is that
important to these people.

01:12:04.087 --> 01:12:07.655
- [Empusa] You may speak to
my master on his grounds,

01:12:09.092 --> 01:12:11.259
place the key under the door.

01:12:11.261 --> 01:12:13.061
Out of respect to
you of the living,

01:12:13.063 --> 01:12:15.630
my master is fickle and cruel.

01:12:18.568 --> 01:12:20.468
- Juryah, are you alright?

01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:21.836
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:12:26.109 --> 01:12:27.375
You have the key.

01:12:27.377 --> 01:12:30.378
- Oh, yeah, here.

01:12:38.922 --> 01:12:42.390
- You heard the
warnings, are you ready?

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.426
- Yes, yes, yes I am.

01:12:48.465 --> 01:12:51.165
(ominous music)

01:13:22.265 --> 01:13:24.599
(bruising)

01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:35.843
(ominous music)

01:13:38.715 --> 01:13:43.384
- It being dramatic,
it trying to scare you.

01:13:44.654 --> 01:13:45.987
- It's working.

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:50.625
- [Red] Evelyn?

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:52.660
- [Evelyn] I'm here, I'm just,
ah, something touched me.

01:13:52.662 --> 01:13:56.097
- [Juryah] Everyone,
stay inside the circle.

01:13:56.099 --> 01:13:57.932
(screaming)

01:13:57.934 --> 01:13:58.766
- [Evelyn] It burned my wrist!

01:13:58.768 --> 01:13:59.600
- [Red] Where are you?

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:00.635
- [Evelyn] Here, I'm here.

01:14:00.637 --> 01:14:02.003
- [Red] It's me, that's me.

01:14:02.005 --> 01:14:03.604
- [Evelyn] He pulled on my arm.

01:14:14.484 --> 01:14:15.983
- Are you okay?

01:14:15.985 --> 01:14:19.053
- Something had
my arm, I'm okay.

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:26.194
(ominous music)

01:14:39.275 --> 01:14:42.677
(children laughing)

01:14:42.679 --> 01:14:44.078
- Here he comes.

01:14:46.382 --> 01:14:47.281
- What?

01:14:52.322 --> 01:14:55.056
(door cracking)

01:14:57.627 --> 01:15:00.361
(ominous music)

01:15:05.702 --> 01:15:07.168
- [Evelyn] Can you see it?

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:09.303
- [Juryah] Yes, I see it.

01:15:13.076 --> 01:15:16.077
(terrifying music)

01:15:46.943 --> 01:15:50.945
(speaking in demonic language)

01:15:56.553 --> 01:16:01.622
- He says Kane is his
favored and he has no reason

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:09.196
to bargain, why does he
have to make a deal with us?

01:16:11.768 --> 01:16:13.000
- I'll take his place.

01:16:13.002 --> 01:16:15.970
- No, I'll take his place.

01:16:15.972 --> 01:16:21.008
- Both of us, he can have
both of us, just let Kane go.

01:16:24.314 --> 01:16:28.316
(speaking in demonic language)

01:16:32.956 --> 01:16:38.025
- He doesn't want you,
you are not children.

01:16:38.394 --> 01:16:40.027
- Why does he?

01:16:40.029 --> 01:16:44.065
- There's something about
the fear of this child,

01:16:45.001 --> 01:16:48.502
that is uniquely delicious.

01:16:49.739 --> 01:16:52.573
- We will do anything
in our power, anything

01:16:53.376 --> 01:16:54.942
to make an exchange.

01:16:57.113 --> 01:16:58.179
We will do anything.

01:17:00.016 --> 01:17:03.985
(speaking in demonic language)

01:17:11.227 --> 01:17:14.895
- You have no power to
satisfy his bargain.

01:17:17.233 --> 01:17:19.033
You have no leverage.

01:17:21.304 --> 01:17:23.638
You only have his power.

01:17:24.941 --> 01:17:27.174
- What does that mean?

01:17:27.176 --> 01:17:30.711
- If he won't bargain,
then we won't leave,

01:17:32.048 --> 01:17:33.414
we'll stay here with Kane.

01:17:34.283 --> 01:17:38.252
(speaking in demonic language)

01:17:50.199 --> 01:17:52.433
- That is an empty threat.

01:17:54.203 --> 01:17:59.273
If you remain here, he will
keep you separate from Kane.

01:18:02.545 --> 01:18:07.615
You will never hold him,
you will never comfort him,

01:18:08.885 --> 01:18:12.720
you will never sooth his pain.

01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:17.525
- No, no, no, I'm sorry,
that I made the threat,

01:18:17.527 --> 01:18:20.294
I apologize, I'm sorry,
I'm so so sorry.

01:18:26.269 --> 01:18:31.105
- What does it mean, only his
power, what does that mean?

01:18:32.341 --> 01:18:36.977
- A bargain on how
to amplify his power,

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:41.082
a bargain will mean
an entity, influence,

01:18:48.124 --> 01:18:49.590
a wider result.

01:18:52.562 --> 01:18:57.264
- It sounds like it
already has a deal in mind.

01:18:57.266 --> 01:19:01.535
- From the beginning,
he always did.

01:19:01.537 --> 01:19:04.271
(ominous music)

01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:45.846
To get your son back, you
will endure any agreement,

01:19:47.049 --> 01:19:52.086
if it means safety and peace.

01:19:53.156 --> 01:19:55.990
But what if that
wasn't a bargain?

01:19:57.693 --> 01:20:01.929
What if you were meant
to pay so much misery,

01:20:03.933 --> 01:20:08.903
what price would be too
much, if others pay it?

01:20:10.039 --> 01:20:11.438
Would you accept?

01:20:19.282 --> 01:20:24.351
- That is my son and I
will do anything, anything,

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:28.055
to get him back home safe.

01:20:33.963 --> 01:20:35.863
- Then we have a deal.

01:20:42.438 --> 01:20:45.072
(string music)

01:21:30.052 --> 01:21:32.219
(crying)

01:21:37.727 --> 01:21:40.394
(string music)

01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:30.344
You must make good on this deal.

01:22:32.415 --> 01:22:36.450
Or penalties will be severe.

01:22:39.956 --> 01:22:40.854
- I will.

01:22:43.092 --> 01:22:46.160
- I'll be leaving here,
I'm going back West.

01:22:48.731 --> 01:22:51.398
I suggest you do the same.

01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:55.135
We will not meet again.

01:22:57.340 --> 01:22:58.405
- Thank you.

01:22:59.875 --> 01:23:04.945
- Do whatever you must to
forget the cost of the deal.

01:23:07.283 --> 01:23:12.119
Or the weight of it will
crush you, forget it.

01:23:15.958 --> 01:23:18.592
(string music)

01:23:39.382 --> 01:23:42.282
- I don't wanna
live here anymore.

01:23:43.119 --> 01:23:47.287
- We aren't gonna live here
anymore, baby, just rest, okay?

01:23:48.557 --> 01:23:50.557
I'm gonna pack up some
stuff and then later

01:23:50.559 --> 01:23:52.626
we're gonna go to grandma's.

01:23:52.628 --> 01:23:53.527
- Okay.

01:23:54.330 --> 01:23:55.863
- Just try to get some sleep.

01:24:04.673 --> 01:24:07.408
- Why isn't daddy going with us?

01:24:09.178 --> 01:24:11.145
- Daddy has to stay
behind a few days,

01:24:12.248 --> 01:24:14.448
he has some work to finish.

01:24:21.257 --> 01:24:24.058
(engine revving)

01:24:38.474 --> 01:24:41.041
(birds chirping)

01:24:41.043 --> 01:24:43.844
(sander buzzing)

01:25:03.866 --> 01:25:06.700
(sander buzzing)

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:11.071
(sander buzzing)

01:25:15.744 --> 01:25:18.378
(string music)

01:26:02.925 --> 01:26:05.659
(ominous music)

01:26:35.958 --> 01:26:38.692
(ominous music)
