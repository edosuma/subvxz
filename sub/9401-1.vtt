00:00.934 --> 00:01.567
<i>Previously
on "One Tree Hill"...</i>

00:02.901 --> 00:05.067
- I'm not on the Chiefs anymore.
- What?

00:05.133 --> 00:07.167
I'm the point guard
for the Charlotte Bobcats.

00:07.234 --> 00:08.934
You're in the NBA?

00:09.000 --> 00:10.501
I'm in the NBA.

00:13.534 --> 00:17.067
You told me that someday
I'd be ready to let someone in.

00:17.133 --> 00:18.801
I think today
might be someday.

00:18.868 --> 00:20.434
I love you.

00:24.300 --> 00:26.300
I used to wonder
why I was still alive.

00:26.367 --> 00:28.033
I'm not.

00:28.100 --> 00:29.968
And this is my hell.

00:30.033 --> 00:31.701
Pull the trigger.

00:31.767 --> 00:32.701
Take the pain away!

00:34.334 --> 00:37.400
Maybe you're still here
for redemption.

00:37.467 --> 00:40.567
So, I guess...

00:40.634 --> 00:42.934
This means
he's gonna die.

00:51.801 --> 00:56.234
I sat there in the dark --
alone, broken.

00:56.300 --> 00:59.167
On the eve of my son's
first game in the NBA,

00:59.234 --> 01:02.033
I sat alone
on a playground basketball court

01:02.100 --> 01:04.434
and waited for death.

01:04.501 --> 01:08.067
I'd been given
only days to live.

01:09.601 --> 01:11.968
That was 14 months ago.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.300
* I like to say *

01:16.367 --> 01:21.901
* I make good use of my time
while you've been away *

01:21.968 --> 01:24.367
* and it's true *

01:24.434 --> 01:28.734
* I've been at my piano
every day *

01:28.801 --> 01:32.133
* thinking of you *

01:37.200 --> 01:39.367
* they talk around *

01:39.434 --> 01:41.133
* I hear them whisper *

01:41.200 --> 01:43.133
* it's the funniest thing,
really *

01:43.200 --> 01:45.000
* they think
you're gone forever *

01:45.067 --> 01:46.300
* I know the trtruth *

01:46.367 --> 01:53.000
* it's just getting hard
to believe it *

01:53.067 --> 01:57.100
* and they all tell me
it's over *

01:57.167 --> 02:00.968
* even stars are lining up *

02:01.033 --> 02:04.033
* I follow the signs
so clearly *

02:04.100 --> 02:06.033
* Still I've fallen *

02:06.100 --> 02:08.633
* the quicksand's
pulling me down *

02:08.701 --> 02:11.934
* I follow the signs
so clearly *

02:12.000 --> 02:13.634
* Still they catch me *

02:13.701 --> 02:17.734
* the quicksand's
pulling me down *

02:21.200 --> 02:22.567
Bill, I want you
to listen to me

02:22.634 --> 02:24.234
because we have a history
of helping each other

02:24.300 --> 02:27.067
and because I'm the best damn
sports agent that you deal with.

02:27.133 --> 02:28.534
Now, listen --

02:28.601 --> 02:30.534
You guys turned it around
last season in a very big way.

02:30.601 --> 02:32.767
But Pennington needs receivers,
and you know it.

02:32.834 --> 02:34.067
Hackett's big.
He's fast.

02:34.133 --> 02:35.467
And you throw that ball
anywhere near him,

02:35.534 --> 02:37.634
he gets up and gets it.

02:39.734 --> 02:41.934
Mm-hmm.
That's absolutely true.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.434
But he's also going into
his third season,

02:43.501 --> 02:45.067
and, historically,

02:45.133 --> 02:47.534
you know that that's when NFL
wide receivers flip the switch.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.434
Santana Moss, Steve Smith --

02:49.501 --> 02:50.567
Hackett is gonna be
right there with them.

02:50.634 --> 02:53.534
Bill, this one is so easy.

02:53.601 --> 02:55.334
You have the money.
You need the player.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.067
All you need to do --
Pull the trigger.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.868
You know what?
I got to cut you off.

03:02.934 --> 03:04.300
I got New England
on line two.

03:08.901 --> 03:10.667
You're doing the right thing.

03:10.734 --> 03:13.534
You're getting a great player
at a great price.

03:13.601 --> 03:16.033
Yeah, I'll have my office
send the paperwork over.

03:16.100 --> 03:17.200
Thanks, Bill.

03:17.267 --> 03:19.734
And, hey, congratulations.

03:19.801 --> 03:21.234
Yeah.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.234
* But I just want to feel
your breath inside me *

03:23.300 --> 03:26.033
* so I can breathe *

03:27.834 --> 03:28.734
Oh.

03:30.434 --> 03:34.534
Hey, Mom.
I got to call you back.

03:34.601 --> 03:36.400
* It's never too soon,
it's never too late *

03:36.467 --> 03:37.968
* so I start screaming out *

03:38.033 --> 03:40.367
* I see your face,
i see your hand reaching down *

03:40.434 --> 03:43.033
* and I yell to you,
and I say *

03:43.100 --> 03:46.033
* I'll follow the signs
so clearly *

03:46.100 --> 03:48.000
* Still I've fallen *

03:48.067 --> 03:50.667
* the quicksand's
pulling me down *

03:50.734 --> 03:52.968
* I'll follow the signs
so clearly *

03:53.033 --> 03:55.667
You could
come with me.

03:55.734 --> 03:56.767
I can't.

03:56.834 --> 03:58.534
You say that every time.

03:58.601 --> 04:00.667
And you say "I can't"
every time.

04:00.734 --> 04:01.734
Because I can't.

04:01.801 --> 04:04.033
But the movie's almost over,

04:04.100 --> 04:07.300
and then you can come back
to Tree Hill,

04:07.367 --> 04:11.167
and we can finally
be together, right?

04:11.234 --> 04:12.934
Yes, of course.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.233
* Pulling me down *

04:18.300 --> 04:20.601
* ahhhhhh *

04:20.666 --> 04:22.400
* oh oh oh *

04:22.467 --> 04:24.367
* oh oh oh *

04:24.434 --> 04:28.434
* oh oh oh oh oh oh *

04:28.501 --> 04:29.968
* oh oh oh *

04:30.033 --> 04:31.934
* oh oh oh *

04:32.000 --> 04:36.067
* oh oh oh oh oh oh *

04:36.133 --> 04:37.667
* ahh ahh ahh *

04:37.734 --> 04:38.934
* oh oh oh *

04:39.000 --> 04:40.534
Good morning. Clothes Over Bros.
Please hold.

04:41.868 --> 04:43.100
Good morning. Clothes Over Bros.
Please hold.

04:43.167 --> 04:44.934
I need you to go online
and find me some pictures,

04:45.000 --> 04:46.167
recent ones.

04:46.234 --> 04:47.601
And call their reps
and get me head shots.

04:47.667 --> 04:49.701
Also, call prime and cancel
the dinner reservation

04:49.767 --> 04:50.868
I had for tomorrow night.

04:52.267 --> 04:54.234
This is good,
but I want to see it in green.

04:54.300 --> 04:55.868
Green is the new orange.

04:55.934 --> 04:57.234
I was heading back to Tree Hill,
so book me a flight,

04:57.300 --> 04:58.667
preferably direct,

04:58.734 --> 05:00.200
and call me in the car
and tell me which terminal.

05:00.267 --> 05:01.334
Is that my coffee?

05:01.400 --> 05:03.100
Mocha double latte,
no foam.

05:03.167 --> 05:04.667
Last time there was foam.
I hate foam. Is there foam?

05:04.734 --> 05:05.767
No foam.

05:05.834 --> 05:07.234
Um, Victoria
wanted to see you about --

05:07.300 --> 05:08.501
About the model
she wants to hire

05:08.567 --> 05:10.067
to be the new face
of Clothes Over Bros.

05:10.133 --> 05:11.334
We're not going with a model.
We're going with an actress.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.467
Cancel the meeting.

05:12.534 --> 05:14.234
She's not gonna like that.

05:14.300 --> 05:15.667
Yeah, well,
she works for me.

05:16.901 --> 05:18.400
Don't tell her
I said that.

05:18.467 --> 05:20.067
Okay, now go.
Chop, chop.

05:20.133 --> 05:21.868
Calliope.

05:21.934 --> 05:26.267
You're a good assistant,
but have some fun, okay?

05:26.334 --> 05:28.400
You're only young once.

05:34.367 --> 05:37.300
The season's over, Nate.

05:37.367 --> 05:39.267
For some guys.

05:39.334 --> 05:40.667
For me...

05:43.868 --> 05:46.200
...it's just the preseason
for next year.

05:46.267 --> 05:48.567
See, that is why I love
being your agent.

05:48.634 --> 05:51.567
Most guys are away on vacation,
but not Nathan Scott.

05:51.634 --> 05:53.200
He's in the gym
doing work.

05:53.267 --> 05:55.400
And I'm not the only one
who's noticed.

05:55.467 --> 05:57.000
What do they say?

05:57.067 --> 05:58.367
All the right things,
man --

05:58.434 --> 06:00.434
That they love you,
you had another great season,

06:00.501 --> 06:02.534
And you're a very important part
of the future.

06:02.601 --> 06:05.467
Does any of this mean
I have a new contract?

06:05.534 --> 06:06.534
Not yet.

06:06.601 --> 06:08.868
But what
did I tell you, man?

06:08.934 --> 06:10.567
14 months ago
when you came up on that 10-day?

06:10.634 --> 06:11.801
"Just do the work."

06:11.868 --> 06:13.868
"Just do the work."
And you have.

06:13.934 --> 06:16.100
You worked hard.
You played great.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.100
And now
it's gonna cost them.

06:19.267 --> 06:21.100
You love this stuff,
don't you?

06:21.167 --> 06:22.334
Hell yeah, I do.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.701
And I'm good at it, man.
So don't sweat it.

06:24.767 --> 06:26.100
I'd never do anything

06:26.167 --> 06:28.167
to jeopardize you
or Haley or Jamie.

06:28.234 --> 06:30.133
I know.

06:30.200 --> 06:33.167
Speaking of, the little man's
got a birthday coming up, right?

06:33.234 --> 06:35.000
Any idea
what he wants for a gift?

06:35.067 --> 06:37.434
Well, you spoiled him with all
the autographed jerseys.

06:37.501 --> 06:39.667
You're just moving through
your client roster now.

06:39.734 --> 06:41.567
I think he's, uh...
he's up to Jerry Rice.

06:44.267 --> 06:45.601
It's a good life, Nate.

06:45.667 --> 06:48.167
Did you ever think
a couple knuckleheads like us

06:48.234 --> 06:49.434
would end up here?

06:49.501 --> 06:50.567
<i>I thought I would.</i>

06:50.634 --> 06:53.033
You, not so much.

06:53.100 --> 06:54.267
Hey, can I ask you
a question

06:54.334 --> 06:55.534
about your meeting
with my bosses?

06:55.601 --> 06:57.067
Yeah.

06:57.133 --> 06:59.434
Couldn't you have at least
worn a suit?

06:59.501 --> 07:02.634
I mean, the jeans, man?
Really?

07:02.701 --> 07:04.067
Yeah, I probably cost you

07:04.133 --> 07:06.167
at least a million dollars
right there.

07:06.234 --> 07:07.567
It was a very bad choice.

07:07.634 --> 07:09.567
Thanks.

07:10.801 --> 07:12.300
* Sunday morning,
my Rebecca... *

07:12.367 --> 07:14.701
Man, it's crazy.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.868
Nobody buying
used CDs no more.

07:16.934 --> 07:18.834
Half the record stores
done closed down.

07:18.901 --> 07:21.033
And this collection
was strong, too.

07:21.100 --> 07:24.767
Look -- Tribe called quest,
de la soul, and biggie.

07:24.834 --> 07:25.801
What?

07:25.868 --> 07:27.467
Maybe try Goodwill?

07:27.534 --> 07:30.133
Man, Killy, Goodwill
is not getting my Tupac CDs.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.601
Ah, they wouldn't
take them either, huh?

07:31.667 --> 07:33.334
Nope.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.667
So, listen, I was thinking,

07:34.734 --> 07:36.601
while you're cleaning out
some clutter,

07:36.667 --> 07:38.734
you might want to move
some other stuff, too.

07:38.801 --> 07:40.133
Oh, word?
Like what?

07:40.200 --> 07:42.133
Like all of it?

07:42.200 --> 07:44.033
All of it?

07:44.100 --> 07:45.901
You want me to move out?

07:45.968 --> 07:47.367
Well, I don't want you to.

07:47.434 --> 07:50.367
I just -- don't you want
your own space with Lauren?

07:50.434 --> 07:53.567
Do I want
my own space -- yes.

07:53.634 --> 07:55.167
But can I afford it
right now

07:55.234 --> 07:57.634
when I'm trying to start
a new business -- no.

07:57.701 --> 07:59.467
I can't believe
you kicking me out.

07:59.534 --> 08:01.400
I'm not kicking you out.
You're on the lease, too.

08:01.467 --> 08:02.400
I just --

08:02.467 --> 08:04.133
You want me to go.

08:04.200 --> 08:07.701
* To be barefoot
on the driveway *

08:07.767 --> 08:09.968
I want you to stay.

08:10.033 --> 08:11.300
Yeah, I know.

08:11.367 --> 08:13.734
You look sad,
Brooke Davis.

08:13.801 --> 08:15.100
I'm not sad.

08:15.167 --> 08:16.634
Yes, you are.

08:16.701 --> 08:20.801
You've been moping around ever
since that night at the beach.

08:20.868 --> 08:23.367
I'm just gonna miss you,
that's all.

08:23.434 --> 08:24.767
But you don't have to.

08:24.834 --> 08:27.567
What's keeping you in Tree Hill
now that Peyton's gone?

08:27.634 --> 08:28.868
You went back for her.

08:28.934 --> 08:30.834
So did you.

08:30.901 --> 08:33.534
That's not fair.

08:33.601 --> 08:36.000
Look, all I'm saying is,

08:36.067 --> 08:38.333
if you can run Clothes Over Bros
from Tree Hill,

08:38.400 --> 08:39.767
you can run it
from anywhere.

08:39.833 --> 08:41.933
But Tree Hill's home.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.801
We'll be okay.

08:43.868 --> 08:46.501
* I think I could never love
another girl *

08:46.567 --> 08:49.400
All right, here we go.

08:49.467 --> 08:51.400
Julian.

08:51.467 --> 08:53.467
This is a great night.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.300
I'm proud of you.

08:55.367 --> 08:58.567
* While she shines my mother's
imitation pearls *

09:29.617 --> 09:31.083
Good morning, little man.

09:31.150 --> 09:33.350
What are you all dressed
and waiting for?

09:33.417 --> 09:35.551
It's my birthday.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.350
Ah, I hate to break it
to you, kiddo,

09:37.417 --> 09:38.918
but your birthday
was yesterday.

09:38.984 --> 09:40.183
You slept
right through it.

09:40.250 --> 09:42.751
Whatever, Mom.

09:46.918 --> 09:48.884
Mom?

09:48.951 --> 09:51.083
Happy birthday!

09:51.150 --> 09:52.651
Aah!

09:52.717 --> 09:54.050
Rah!

09:54.117 --> 09:55.784
- I can't believe you're 4 already!
- Seven.

09:55.851 --> 09:57.784
- Oh, would you settle for 5?
- No.

09:57.851 --> 09:59.417
Maybe we could feed you coffee
and cigarettes

09:59.484 --> 10:00.384
and keep you
really small.

10:00.450 --> 10:01.751
Mnh-mnh! I'm 7.

10:01.817 --> 10:04.018
I've been waiting a long time
for this, you know?

10:04.083 --> 10:05.317
I know.

10:05.384 --> 10:06.784
And I really am sorry
we had to cancel your party.

10:06.851 --> 10:08.817
You're really
not that funny.

10:08.884 --> 10:10.350
Hey, I can make you
laugh though.

10:13.417 --> 10:14.317
Ha! Ha! Ha!

10:14.384 --> 10:15.517
What's the matter? What?

10:15.584 --> 10:17.050
You too old to be tickled,
Mr. 7?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.684
Help!
Where's Dad when I need him?

10:18.751 --> 10:20.317
He can't help you now!
He's at work!

10:32.083 --> 10:35.050
* Even though
I'm the only one *

10:35.117 --> 10:37.651
Mmm.
You always smell so good.

10:37.717 --> 10:40.250
It's my
rainstorm body spray.

10:40.317 --> 10:42.083
* Sneak around
and let yourself in back *

10:42.150 --> 10:44.083
It's gonna be
a stormy night.

10:44.150 --> 10:45.517
Come here.

10:45.584 --> 10:48.384
* Just give it a chance,
just give it a chance *

10:48.450 --> 10:49.450
And cut!

10:49.517 --> 10:51.717
Let's check it.

10:51.784 --> 10:52.851
* Get the devil
to dance like that? *

10:52.918 --> 10:54.117
What?

10:54.183 --> 10:58.117
You are terrible at this.
You're just so wooden.

10:58.183 --> 11:00.317
Hey, I told you I didn't
want to do this, all right?

11:00.384 --> 11:02.617
I'm just playing, man.
You look great.

11:02.684 --> 11:04.350
No, I don't.
I look wooden.

11:04.417 --> 11:06.617
I'm a wooden tool
that uses body spray.

11:06.684 --> 11:08.350
Come on, Nate.
This is a great gig.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.083
A guy works all day,
he has a date --

11:10.150 --> 11:11.284
He wants to smell nice,

11:11.350 --> 11:13.384
so he reaches
for some rainstorm body spray.

11:13.450 --> 11:14.617
And why?

11:14.684 --> 11:17.083
Because that's what
Nathan Scott does.

11:17.150 --> 11:19.417
You know what else
Nathan Scott does?

11:19.484 --> 11:22.117
He takes a shower.
He actually washes himself.

11:22.183 --> 11:23.217
Body spray?

11:23.284 --> 11:24.417
You might
want to keep it down

11:24.484 --> 11:26.050
seeing as how
they're paying you six figures

11:26.117 --> 11:27.751
and it is your only
source of income right now.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.217
Oh, and whose fault
is that?

11:29.284 --> 11:30.784
Oh, that's right.
My agent's you.

11:30.851 --> 11:33.083
I don't know why you choose
to hurt me like this.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.117
The contract negotiations,
the endorsements,

11:35.183 --> 11:36.784
the never-ending love
and support.

11:36.851 --> 11:38.150
Oh, okay.

11:38.217 --> 11:39.951
All right, now I really do
need some body spray

11:40.018 --> 11:40.984
to cover all that crap.

11:41.050 --> 11:42.150
It all comes
full circle.

11:42.217 --> 11:43.384
Pictures up!

11:43.450 --> 11:45.217
Look, you sell the products.
I'll sell you.

11:45.284 --> 11:47.751
But go and get this right
so we can eat some cake already.

11:47.817 --> 11:50.851
Otherwise, "it's a gonna be
a stormy night."

11:50.918 --> 11:51.851
Okay, all right.

11:51.918 --> 11:53.384
You're so stormy.

12:15.150 --> 12:17.250
Hey, man, what's up?

12:19.717 --> 12:22.918
Okay.
It ain't gonna work.

12:22.984 --> 12:24.951
What?

12:25.018 --> 12:27.050
You trying to get rid of me
with your naked ass.

12:27.117 --> 12:29.284
I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:29.350 --> 12:31.284
I'm just hanging out
in my apartment.

12:31.350 --> 12:33.484
It ain't gonna work.

12:35.951 --> 12:37.284
Ain't gonna work!

12:40.951 --> 12:42.717
Can I come out yet?

12:42.784 --> 12:46.018
Uh... okay!

12:48.284 --> 12:49.851
Ta-da!

12:51.250 --> 12:53.484
Whoa.

12:53.551 --> 12:56.217
It's gonna be
the best birthday ever!

12:56.284 --> 12:59.584
See? All this,
and not one scary clown.

12:59.651 --> 13:01.050
Hey, you want to
see your cake?

13:03.517 --> 13:04.884
Wait, this is not --

13:04.951 --> 13:07.384
"Happy birthday, Jam?"

13:07.450 --> 13:10.317
This cake is so good.

13:10.384 --> 13:11.651
Aunt Quinn!

13:11.717 --> 13:13.484
Kid, I can't remember!

13:13.551 --> 13:14.551
Mmm.

13:14.617 --> 13:17.250
Dude, you're like,
what, 32 now?

13:17.317 --> 13:19.617
- 7.
- 7, right. Of course.

13:19.684 --> 13:21.984
I was talking to your mom.

13:22.050 --> 13:23.918
Ha ha.
What are you doing here?

13:23.984 --> 13:25.784
I had an assignment
in New York, and I thought,

13:25.851 --> 13:28.183
"I don't know, I haven't seen
my dorkiest sister in forever."

13:28.250 --> 13:29.584
What?
Taylor wasn't home?

13:29.651 --> 13:30.884
You're so funny.

13:30.951 --> 13:32.250
Get your sexy butt
over here.

13:32.317 --> 13:33.551
Mmm.

13:33.617 --> 13:36.384
Aunt Quinn, you ate my cake
before I made a wish.

13:36.450 --> 13:38.551
Nah.

13:38.617 --> 13:41.117
<i>See, I don't think
this is your real cake.</i>

13:41.183 --> 13:46.018
If you look really,
really close, if it was,

13:46.083 --> 13:48.250
I wouldn't be able
to do this!

13:50.150 --> 13:51.584
Aah!

13:51.651 --> 13:52.884
Aw.

13:52.951 --> 13:56.183
You're so dead.

13:59.617 --> 14:02.217
Oh! Hey!

14:02.284 --> 14:04.817
You're crazy.

14:04.884 --> 14:06.417
* Shock shock horror horror *

14:06.484 --> 14:10.484
* spill spill red wine
down my shirt *

14:10.551 --> 14:11.617
Run!

14:11.684 --> 14:13.350
Oh, you're so dead!

14:13.417 --> 14:16.083
* Thank you very much *

14:18.984 --> 14:20.817
Hey, can I borrow a pen?

14:20.884 --> 14:23.083
I got to sign
Jamie's card.

14:23.150 --> 14:25.150
I don't know why you got to
take this so personally.

14:25.217 --> 14:26.984
I don't know what you're talking
about, dawg.

14:27.050 --> 14:28.050
I'm just
airing things out.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.284
No, you're not.

14:29.350 --> 14:30.851
You're mad because
I want you to move out.

14:30.918 --> 14:33.651
But it's only because I'm trying
to step things up with Millie.

14:33.717 --> 14:35.918
It's not like I don't still
consider you a great friend.

14:35.984 --> 14:38.183
It's not like I don't want
to hang with you.

14:38.250 --> 14:40.317
You're my friend.

14:41.751 --> 14:43.018
I love you.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.018
I love you, too.

14:45.083 --> 14:47.050
Okay.

14:49.918 --> 14:51.617
Good to know
the stereotype's not true.

14:52.784 --> 14:55.651
* We took the test *

14:55.717 --> 14:58.551
* and we came out clean *

14:58.617 --> 15:01.484
* and you got drunk *

15:01.551 --> 15:04.884
* and I got mean *

15:04.951 --> 15:07.484
* Then I gave up *

15:07.551 --> 15:09.217
* and you did, too *

15:09.284 --> 15:13.751
So, I want you to know I totally
took one for the team,

15:13.817 --> 15:18.150
and I made you some closet space
in the spare bedroom.

15:20.050 --> 15:21.183
* I make amends *

15:21.250 --> 15:22.551
* You make them, too *

15:22.617 --> 15:23.984
* and I realize *

15:24.050 --> 15:26.684
So, they called me about
that film in New Zealand.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.417
They want me
to produce it.

15:28.484 --> 15:31.150
* I live alone *

15:31.217 --> 15:33.851
It's a big movie, brooke.
It could make my career.

15:33.918 --> 15:37.150
Wow. Um...

15:38.350 --> 15:40.018
When does it start?

15:40.083 --> 15:42.584
Right after this one.

15:42.651 --> 15:44.884
So, basically, now.

15:47.684 --> 15:49.951
For how long?

15:50.018 --> 15:52.117
Eight months.

15:52.183 --> 15:55.584
* I can't commit to anything *

15:55.651 --> 15:57.717
* I'm way too settled down *

15:57.784 --> 15:59.817
I don't
have to take it.

15:59.884 --> 16:03.117
No.
You should.

16:03.183 --> 16:05.651
You have to.

16:05.717 --> 16:11.183
Time's gonna fly by,
I promise.

16:11.250 --> 16:14.284
Then we'll be together,
okay?

16:16.018 --> 16:18.551
* Then I'll give up *

16:18.617 --> 16:22.018
* and you will, too *

16:22.083 --> 16:27.484
* but we do what
we have to do *

16:45.185 --> 16:45.985
Thanks.

16:48.250 --> 16:50.517
Oh, you know what?
Let me get that for you, Hales.

16:50.584 --> 16:51.684
Thanks, Clay.

16:51.751 --> 16:53.850
And by the way,
you look gorgeous.

16:53.917 --> 16:57.284
Easy now. Have I mentioned
he only makes 10%?

16:57.351 --> 16:59.184
Yeah, but I wasn't the one making out
with a lingerie model all morning.

16:59.250 --> 17:01.217
We weren't making--
There was no making out.

17:01.284 --> 17:02.250
Hey, Dad.

17:02.317 --> 17:04.150
- Hey, buddy!
- Ahh.

17:04.217 --> 17:06.050
So, are you having
a good time, 7?

17:06.117 --> 17:07.416
Yeah.

17:07.483 --> 17:09.784
Aunt Quinn is here, and
she surprised me with my cake.

17:09.849 --> 17:11.849
You know, the last girl I took
home surprised me with --

17:11.916 --> 17:13.517
Hey!
Who wants to open presents?

17:13.584 --> 17:15.584
Yay!

17:18.284 --> 17:19.550
Check it out.

17:19.617 --> 17:20.883
Hey, he thinks
you're hot.

17:20.950 --> 17:21.950
I am hot.

17:22.017 --> 17:23.517
Hi, Nate.
Hey, Quinn.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.416
Clay, my sister-in-law
Quinn.

17:25.483 --> 17:27.017
Quinn, my agent, Clay.
Hi.

17:27.084 --> 17:28.883
Look, the Bobcats
got no depth in the backcourt,

17:28.950 --> 17:31.217
So step up and get this guy
paid, Jerry Maguire.

17:35.584 --> 17:37.417
I like her.

17:37.484 --> 17:39.050
Hey, it's me again.

17:39.117 --> 17:42.484
I just thought you might want
to wish Jamie a happy birthday.

17:42.551 --> 17:44.484
So call me
when you get this...

17:44.551 --> 17:47.017
or any of the other
three messages.

17:47.084 --> 17:50.017
Okay, bye.

17:50.084 --> 17:52.150
Okay, we're gonna
open presents.

17:52.217 --> 17:53.484
Are you all right?

17:53.551 --> 17:56.950
Julian's starting
that new movie in New Zealand,

17:57.017 --> 17:58.850
and you know how it is.

17:58.917 --> 18:00.517
Tell me about it.
Nathan's gone most of the year.

18:00.584 --> 18:01.718
Yeah.

18:01.784 --> 18:04.184
Well, at least the NBA
has an off-season.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.084
Apparently,
Hollywood doesn't.

18:06.150 --> 18:07.917
How's your new record
coming?

18:07.983 --> 18:09.184
So-so.

18:09.250 --> 18:10.983
The parent label
is sending somebody out

18:11.050 --> 18:12.551
to run some
of the day-to-day stuff

18:12.617 --> 18:14.184
so I can get
a little bit more done.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.950
They said something
about freeing me up.

18:16.017 --> 18:17.651
Well, that's good, right?

18:17.718 --> 18:20.284
Come on, Mom!
Chop, chop!

18:20.351 --> 18:21.317
Chop, chop?

18:21.384 --> 18:22.883
He gets that from me.

18:22.950 --> 18:23.917
Presents!

18:23.983 --> 18:25.250
The bossiness, too.

18:30.617 --> 18:32.250
All right, Jame.
Which one's first?

18:32.317 --> 18:33.883
Uncle Lucas.

18:33.950 --> 18:37.950
* My faith is like wings
made of wax *

18:38.017 --> 18:39.050
Oh, read the card!

18:39.117 --> 18:42.983
* That it won't last *

18:43.050 --> 18:45.417
"Jamie, Peyton and I
miss you every day.

18:45.484 --> 18:48.517
"This present was my best friend
until I met your mom.

18:48.584 --> 18:51.784
"I got it from my Uncle Keith
when I turned 7,

18:51.850 --> 18:54.250
"and now
I want you to have it.

18:54.317 --> 18:55.983
"It got me
through all kinds of stuff,

18:56.050 --> 18:57.351
"and I hope
it helps you, too.

18:57.417 --> 18:58.718
I love you --
Uncle Lucas."

18:58.784 --> 19:00.950
* Too afraid to dream *

19:01.017 --> 19:04.850
Cool!
It's Uncle Lucas' basketball.

19:04.917 --> 19:06.017
Check it out, Dad!

19:06.084 --> 19:08.883
* I want to chase
the daylight *

19:08.950 --> 19:10.850
"Skills."

19:10.917 --> 19:12.950
Ha, that's what
I'm talkin' about, baby.

19:13.017 --> 19:15.917
Awesome! CDs!

19:15.983 --> 19:19.351
Old-school hip-hop.
Tupac, Biggie, Run-DMC, a'ight!

19:19.417 --> 19:20.850
Wait, I'm sorry --

19:20.917 --> 19:24.850
You just gave a 7-year-old
your tired, old, used CDs?

19:24.917 --> 19:26.584
Look, baby, I had to.
Goodwill wouldn't even take it.

19:26.651 --> 19:27.484
Oh, my...

19:27.551 --> 19:28.883
Dad.

19:28.950 --> 19:31.050
Don't worry, Jamie.
I actually bought you something.

19:32.983 --> 19:36.150
Awesome!
A Jerry Rice jersey.

19:36.217 --> 19:39.117
Oh, man, that is exactly
what I was gonna get you --

19:39.184 --> 19:41.017
An autographed
Jerry Rice jersey.

19:41.084 --> 19:43.317
It's not autographed.

19:43.384 --> 19:45.751
Huh. I see.
One second.

19:48.317 --> 19:50.384
Jerry.
Hey, it's Clay.

19:50.451 --> 19:54.651
Listen, I'm at Jamie Scott's
7th birthday party, and...

19:54.718 --> 19:56.517
He thought you were 6.

19:56.584 --> 19:58.317
7.

19:58.384 --> 20:00.517
He claims he's 7.
Yeah, he's a little short.

20:00.584 --> 20:02.050
Hey, anyways,
I was wondering

20:02.117 --> 20:04.084
if you could maybe
sign his jersey sometime.

20:05.184 --> 20:06.517
All right, cool.

20:06.584 --> 20:09.017
Yeah, thanks, man.
Appreciate it.

20:09.084 --> 20:10.684
All right, not a problem.
Sweet.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.517
Especially since
he's in the house.

20:12.518 --> 20:13.918
Where's the birthday boy?

20:17.850 --> 20:19.850
Hey, where's Jamie?

20:19.917 --> 20:22.917
Would you look at that?
It's Jerry Rice.

20:24.150 --> 20:25.684
How are you guys doing?

20:25.751 --> 20:26.983
What's up, Jamie?

20:27.050 --> 20:28.950
Oh, damn, my gift sucks.

20:30.850 --> 20:32.950
* I'm gonna live this life *

20:33.017 --> 20:35.317
All right.

20:35.384 --> 20:36.451
Hi, Nate.

20:36.517 --> 20:38.417
Do you mind
if I get a picture?

20:38.484 --> 20:40.150
Yeah, sure, no problem.

20:44.850 --> 20:46.917
You had a great season
last year.

20:46.983 --> 20:48.317
Did you re-sign yet?

20:48.384 --> 20:50.484
No, not yet.
Hopefully soon though.

20:50.551 --> 20:51.684
I hope so.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.551
Well, it was good
to see you again.

20:54.617 --> 20:58.084
* No, I will never look back *

20:58.150 --> 20:59.983
* I'm gonna live this life *

21:00.050 --> 21:02.117
You don't remember me,
do you?

21:02.184 --> 21:03.351
Hey, Dad.

21:03.417 --> 21:05.351
Check it out.
Jerry Rice signed my jersey.

21:05.417 --> 21:08.684
Oh, look at that!
It's great, buddy.

21:08.751 --> 21:10.818
* So open up the sky *

21:13.117 --> 21:15.584
* and open up my eyes *

21:15.651 --> 21:17.784
Hey, little man.

21:17.850 --> 21:20.517
You want your present or what?
We have a tradition, you know.

21:20.584 --> 21:21.850
I know.
It's my favorite.

21:21.917 --> 21:24.317
That's what
I wanted to hear.

21:24.384 --> 21:30.617
All right, you get this much
for being my godson.

21:30.684 --> 21:35.551
And an extra zero for being
my very favorite guy.

21:35.617 --> 21:37.718
Whoa.
Thanks, Aunt Brooke.

21:37.784 --> 21:41.117
You're welcome.
I love you, buddy.

21:41.184 --> 21:43.050
What did you wish for?

21:43.117 --> 21:45.617
Well, if I tell,
it won't come true.

21:45.684 --> 21:48.250
But maybe I can wish
something for you.

21:48.317 --> 21:50.684
Mom says
I get one wish for me,

21:50.751 --> 21:52.484
and I can wish stuff
for other people, too.

21:52.551 --> 21:54.850
Dude, hook me up.

21:54.917 --> 21:56.517
Okay, here it goes.

21:56.584 --> 22:01.617
* Chasing the daylight *

22:01.684 --> 22:04.517
* chasing the daylight *

22:04.584 --> 22:10.451
* I'm chasing you there *

22:10.517 --> 22:12.983
Wow, you're good.

22:16.067 --> 22:18.134
What are you doing here?

22:18.201 --> 22:20.134
It's Jamie's birthday.

22:20.201 --> 22:22.201
What about the movie?

22:22.267 --> 22:24.334
Well, I moved
some things around.

22:25.767 --> 22:27.401
Mm!

22:30.067 --> 22:32.767
Look, mom.
Aunt Quinn got me luggage.

22:32.834 --> 22:34.401
Uh-huh.

22:34.468 --> 22:36.700
That's good.
I got it, buddy.

22:36.767 --> 22:38.700
So, how long
do we get you?

22:38.767 --> 22:40.201
I don't know.
A few days.

22:40.267 --> 22:44.633
That sounds wonderful.
Come on.

22:44.700 --> 22:46.034
I don't know
about this problem.

22:46.101 --> 22:47.368
I'm still
working on it.

22:47.434 --> 22:48.934
Anyway, one of the great things
about this house

22:49.001 --> 22:52.734
is that there's all these spare
bedrooms nobody ever uses.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.500
Really?

22:55.567 --> 22:56.734
Would you guys
get a room?

22:56.800 --> 22:58.867
And not one of ours,
please.

22:58.934 --> 23:02.301
Welcome back, Julian.

23:02.368 --> 23:06.201
I'm sorry!
We're going!

23:06.267 --> 23:08.700
* If I could be that guy *

23:08.767 --> 23:10.600
Hut!

23:12.368 --> 23:14.301
So, I think I'm gonna
take off pretty soon.

23:14.368 --> 23:16.334
I got to
knock out some work,

23:16.401 --> 23:18.734
and the body spray girl's
coming by.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.667
The girl
from the shoot today.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.900
She has a name, you know?
It's Kylie.

23:23.967 --> 23:25.500
Of course it is.

23:25.567 --> 23:26.967
Hut!

23:27.034 --> 23:29.001
* When I go to sleep *

23:29.067 --> 23:30.001
Get him!

23:31.500 --> 23:34.368
Touchdown!

23:34.434 --> 23:35.934
Someday when he's older,

23:36.001 --> 23:38.368
and he thinks back
on his best days as a kid,

23:38.434 --> 23:39.800
he'll think of this day,

23:39.867 --> 23:44.734
the day he was happy
and safe and loved.

23:46.401 --> 23:48.667
That's a hell
of a gift, Nate.

23:48.734 --> 23:51.800
All right.
You fellas need anything?

23:51.867 --> 23:52.934
Just you.

23:53.001 --> 23:54.967
Oh, well.
All righty.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.234
Your sister's hot,
Hales.

23:57.301 --> 23:59.834
Yeah, so is her husband,
Clay.

23:59.900 --> 24:01.633
She's always been amazing,

24:01.700 --> 24:04.334
talented, artistic --
wonderful marriage.

24:04.401 --> 24:05.767
Okay, guys.

24:05.834 --> 24:07.368
We got the greatest receiver
in the history of the game

24:07.434 --> 24:08.967
right here.

24:09.034 --> 24:10.167
We're going deep to Jamie.

24:10.234 --> 24:11.201
Yeah.

24:11.267 --> 24:12.533
Oh, man.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.034
Lauren, you run a slant.
Andre, stay short.

24:14.101 --> 24:15.500
So, what do I do?

24:15.567 --> 24:16.533
Jerry Rice, you block.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.267
Ready? Break!

24:18.334 --> 24:22.800
207 touchdowns and they
got me blocking? Darn it.

24:22.867 --> 24:25.368
* I'm nothing much,
i know it's true *

24:25.434 --> 24:27.167
Hut!

24:27.234 --> 24:28.234
Jamie!

24:34.468 --> 24:35.867
She throws
a mean spiral.

24:38.567 --> 24:40.600
My sister Quinn.

24:40.667 --> 24:43.267
* I wanna see *

24:43.334 --> 24:49.101
* looking right at me *

24:49.167 --> 24:51.434
The beach
is becoming our spot.

24:51.500 --> 24:54.067
I don't think
you can call it a spot

24:54.134 --> 24:55.700
<i>if it's
every other month.</i>

24:55.767 --> 24:58.067
I guess that's fair.

24:58.134 --> 24:59.967
No, I'm sorry.

25:00.034 --> 25:03.434
Do you remember how it was
in the beginning?

25:03.500 --> 25:06.967
Even if we were apart,
we'd talk every night.

25:07.034 --> 25:09.834
And my heart raced
with every text.

25:09.900 --> 25:13.934
And every time my phone rang,
I hoped it would be you.

25:14.001 --> 25:17.567
* You know where
I can be found *

25:17.633 --> 25:20.368
I still do that
with you.

25:20.434 --> 25:22.201
Yeah?

25:22.267 --> 25:28.468
* I wanna see
looking right at me *

25:28.533 --> 25:30.700
* if I could be that guy *

25:30.767 --> 25:34.034
Peyton used to say,
"People always leave."

25:34.101 --> 25:38.101
Who knew she was actually
talking about her stupid ass?

25:44.167 --> 25:46.800
I'm just lonely.

25:46.867 --> 25:48.567
We're here now.

25:48.633 --> 25:51.201
I know.

25:51.267 --> 25:54.067
And it's amazing.

25:54.134 --> 25:56.834
And it's what
I wished for.

26:02.834 --> 26:04.633
Want to know
what I wished for?

26:04.700 --> 26:06.001
Mm-hmm.

26:06.067 --> 26:07.567
Skinny-dipping.

26:07.633 --> 26:09.468
You did not!

26:09.533 --> 26:12.301
Uh-huh, I did.
You coming or what?

26:12.368 --> 26:14.368
That's what she said.

26:17.234 --> 26:18.967
Aah!

26:24.134 --> 26:26.767
Ohh!

26:37.184 --> 26:40.518
You know, I think our son
had a great time today.

26:40.583 --> 26:42.917
He has his mom
to thank for that.

26:42.984 --> 26:45.217
I have his dad to thank
for a great life.

26:45.284 --> 26:48.418
You know the last days
when you were on the road,

26:48.484 --> 26:51.384
this is all I dreamed of --
nights like these?

26:51.451 --> 26:54.084
I think it's what
I've always dreamed of.

26:54.151 --> 26:57.451
It's more than I dreamed.

26:57.518 --> 27:00.151
Who's creeping all up
in my hood?

27:00.217 --> 27:01.418
What?

27:01.484 --> 27:03.384
Skills gave me
his CD collection.

27:03.451 --> 27:05.284
Oh, Lord.

27:05.351 --> 27:06.817
Did you have a good birthday,
Jamie?

27:06.884 --> 27:08.884
The best. I'm glad you guys
are my parents.

27:08.950 --> 27:10.617
Well, we're glad
we didn't leave you

27:10.683 --> 27:12.884
on the steps of that
orphanage... some days.

27:12.950 --> 27:13.900
Very funny.

27:13.901 --> 27:14.850
Hey, got
your new ball, huh?

27:14.917 --> 27:17.683
You know, your birthday's
not over yet.

27:17.750 --> 27:19.750
What do you say we go down
to the river court,

27:19.817 --> 27:21.917
see if this thing's
got any good shots left in it?

27:21.984 --> 27:22.884
Cool, I'll get ready.

27:22.950 --> 27:24.884
Want to come?

27:24.950 --> 27:25.984
Um...

27:26.051 --> 27:27.884
No, I think
it'll be good for him

27:27.950 --> 27:29.717
to have some time
with his dad.

27:29.784 --> 27:31.484
I'll just hang out
with Quinn.

27:31.550 --> 27:33.550
You know,
I'm glad Quinn's here.

27:33.617 --> 27:35.484
You guys
will have fun together.

27:35.550 --> 27:36.984
Yeah, me too.

27:37.051 --> 27:38.683
I'll see you.

27:42.151 --> 27:43.151
Oh.

27:43.217 --> 27:45.084
Summer night,
bottle of wine...

27:45.151 --> 27:46.351
I know.

27:46.418 --> 27:48.251
If I was Taylor,
it would totally be on.

27:48.317 --> 27:51.151
Oh, you brat.

27:51.217 --> 27:53.617
Well, well,
my rock star little sister

27:53.683 --> 27:57.351
hanging out at her lavish pool
with her pro-basketball husband.

27:57.418 --> 28:00.550
Speaking of husbands,
how is David?

28:00.617 --> 28:02.051
Where is David?

28:02.117 --> 28:04.518
David's working on a documentary
to save the world.

28:04.583 --> 28:07.550
Wow.
That sounds like David.

28:07.617 --> 28:09.084
You miss him?

28:09.151 --> 28:11.784
Yeah, I do.

28:11.850 --> 28:15.051
You know, sometimes I think
about the way we grew up...

28:15.117 --> 28:19.950
That house and the noise...
the family.

28:21.984 --> 28:23.617
I miss it, you know?

28:23.683 --> 28:25.583
Why, Haley Bob?

28:28.583 --> 28:31.451
I mean, you have it all
right here.

28:31.518 --> 28:36.217
* Except I think
I've had enough *

28:36.284 --> 28:39.950
All right, big man.
Let's see what you got.

28:42.284 --> 28:44.850
You know, this old ball's
probably a little rusty.

28:44.917 --> 28:46.217
Why don't you try again?

28:49.683 --> 28:50.850
There we go!

28:50.917 --> 28:52.750
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Good as new.

28:52.817 --> 28:54.950
Was Uncle Lucas
a good player?

28:55.017 --> 28:56.950
Yes, he was very good.

28:57.017 --> 28:58.583
How come
he stopped playing?

28:58.650 --> 29:01.351
Well, he, uh, he had a problem
with his heart.

29:01.418 --> 29:03.084
Like Grandpa Dan?

29:03.151 --> 29:06.051
Yeah, yeah,
kind of like Grandpa Dan.

29:06.117 --> 29:07.518
I miss him.

29:08.750 --> 29:10.317
Uncle Lucas, I mean.

29:10.384 --> 29:12.117
Yeah, I know you do, buddy.

29:12.184 --> 29:15.084
I'll tell you what --
instead of playing "Horse,"

29:15.151 --> 29:18.084
why don't we play a game
of "Lucas" tonight, huh?

29:18.151 --> 29:19.518
All right, you go first.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.583
Okay.

29:23.817 --> 29:26.884
Really? It's like that?

29:26.950 --> 29:29.484
All right, so, if I miss this,
I get an "L"?

29:29.550 --> 29:30.550
Yes, you do.

29:30.617 --> 29:32.084
If I make it,
you give me 50 bucks.

29:32.151 --> 29:33.217
Yeah.

29:33.284 --> 29:35.084
Aw!
Dang it.

29:35.151 --> 29:36.884
You get an "L."

29:38.984 --> 29:43.617
* I had won *

29:43.683 --> 29:51.550
* so where
is the good feeling? *

29:51.617 --> 29:58.351
* Where is the lighting up? *

29:58.418 --> 30:04.117
* Where are the thousand
voices screaming *

30:04.184 --> 30:06.717
Hey, it's me.
Let's roll some calls.

30:06.784 --> 30:08.518
Try Mitch from the Lakers.

30:12.518 --> 30:14.950
So, how is
the movie going?

30:15.017 --> 30:18.151
Well, we ran into
a couple of issues

30:18.217 --> 30:20.617
with work visas
and permits.

30:20.683 --> 30:23.084
Meaning?

30:23.151 --> 30:27.017
Meaning it's gonna be more
like 10 months, not 8.

30:30.950 --> 30:32.617
You're killing me.

30:32.683 --> 30:36.917
I know, but I do have
some good news.

30:36.984 --> 30:40.950
I decided
not to produce the movie.

30:41.017 --> 30:42.884
What?

30:42.950 --> 30:44.984
Yeah.

30:45.051 --> 30:47.784
But why?
That was an important movie.

30:47.850 --> 30:52.084
No, it was a lucrative movie.
It wasn't important.

30:52.151 --> 30:56.117
And I want to make
important movies.

30:56.184 --> 30:58.717
And, besides,
there's this girl

30:58.784 --> 31:01.784
that I'm kind of
in love with, and...

31:01.850 --> 31:05.351
I couldn't be away from her
for another day.

31:05.418 --> 31:09.550
* ...crawl beneath the surface
of my skin *

31:09.617 --> 31:15.683
* Will I let it in? *

31:15.750 --> 31:18.850
* Oh *

31:18.917 --> 31:25.518
* There must be a heart
that keeps me here *

31:25.583 --> 31:32.051
* there must be a heart
that keeps me here *

31:32.117 --> 31:38.650
* away from the panic
and the fear *

31:38.717 --> 31:45.151
* There must be a heart
that keeps me here *

31:46.550 --> 31:48.217
If you look
at the history of this position

31:48.284 --> 31:50.418
and the last five contracts
given to players under 25

31:50.484 --> 31:52.284
with his numbers,
you'll see --

31:52.351 --> 31:56.251
Well, I think you'll see that
we're not being unreasonable.

31:58.717 --> 31:59.884
Sorry.

31:59.950 --> 32:01.917
Mm-hmm.
Well...

32:04.217 --> 32:06.484
Yeah.

32:06.550 --> 32:08.518
Nice place.

32:08.583 --> 32:10.917
I assume
it has a bedroom.

32:10.984 --> 32:13.084
Yeah.

32:13.151 --> 32:14.550
Uh-huh.

32:14.617 --> 32:17.117
Well, there's been a baseline
set by the marketplace, so...

32:22.817 --> 32:24.683
Uh-huh.

32:24.750 --> 32:29.384
Uh-huh.

32:29.451 --> 32:30.850
Uh-huh.

32:33.451 --> 32:35.451
I'll see you in there.

32:43.184 --> 32:45.850
Bob, I got to
call you back.

32:49.518 --> 32:53.650
And there's wild animals
that roam about everywhere.

32:53.717 --> 32:56.950
And when little boys turn 7,
just like you,

32:57.017 --> 32:59.683
they have to go
out into the wilderness

32:59.750 --> 33:03.117
and live alone
for a whole week.

33:03.184 --> 33:04.251
Whoa.

33:04.317 --> 33:06.518
I probably
couldn't do that.

33:08.518 --> 33:10.550
Okay, time for bed, buddy!

33:10.617 --> 33:12.217
Okay.

33:12.284 --> 33:13.683
Good night, Aunt Quinn.

33:13.750 --> 33:16.251
Good night, monkey face!

33:16.317 --> 33:20.051
Happy birthday, buddy.
I'll be up in a minute.

33:20.117 --> 33:23.284
I think he really missed you.

33:23.351 --> 33:24.484
<i>I know I did.</i>

33:24.550 --> 33:27.284
I missed you, too.

33:29.217 --> 33:32.717
That's weird.
It's the studio calling.

33:32.784 --> 33:34.184
Why's that weird?

33:34.251 --> 33:36.484
Because it's my studio,
and I'm here.

33:36.550 --> 33:38.151
Please don't be me
calling.

33:40.217 --> 33:41.650
Hello?

33:46.184 --> 33:47.251
Hi!

33:49.583 --> 33:51.151
Hi.

33:51.217 --> 33:52.583
Interesting
business hours.

33:52.650 --> 33:54.251
I waited in the bar
for half the day,

33:54.317 --> 33:56.151
and finally the manager
let me in.

33:56.217 --> 33:57.284
I'm so sorry.

33:57.351 --> 33:59.717
It is my son's birthday party
today.

33:59.784 --> 34:01.583
I'm Haley anyway.

34:01.650 --> 34:03.017
It's nice to meet you.

34:03.084 --> 34:05.451
Miranda Stone.
John Knight sends his best.

34:05.518 --> 34:07.317
We're all looking forward
to hearing more of your music.

34:07.384 --> 34:08.583
Thank you.

34:08.650 --> 34:10.083
Yeah, I know the process
has been a little slow.

34:10.150 --> 34:11.384
It's been tough to focus
on my record

34:11.451 --> 34:14.083
while running the label
and raising my son, and...

34:14.150 --> 34:16.184
Yeah, we lost Peyton
to one of those.

34:16.251 --> 34:17.117
Sorry?

34:17.118 --> 34:18.984
Kids, you know?
Family.

34:19.051 --> 34:23.583
Uh, well, you know, we are just
so happy that you're here.

34:23.650 --> 34:25.317
And I know the label's
gonna run a lot smoother

34:25.384 --> 34:27.184
with you at the helm.

34:27.251 --> 34:30.051
Yeah, when we said we'd free you up,
that's not what we meant.

34:30.117 --> 34:32.451
I don't understand.

34:32.518 --> 34:35.884
I'm not here
to run the label.

34:35.949 --> 34:37.518
I'm here to close it.

34:44.317 --> 34:46.317
Quinn?

34:46.384 --> 34:48.650
Hey, can I talk to you
for a minute?

34:50.016 --> 34:52.650
What?
What's going on?

34:52.717 --> 34:55.184
You know earlier when --

34:55.251 --> 34:57.016
When I said
I missed David?

34:58.950 --> 35:00.017
I do.

35:00.084 --> 35:02.784
And I have
for a while now.

35:02.850 --> 35:05.317
What happened, Quinn?
You said he...

35:13.484 --> 35:15.917
I left him.

35:15.984 --> 35:19.051
Oh, hey.

35:21.317 --> 35:23.384
Why?

35:25.351 --> 35:28.317
Because he's not the man
I fell in love with.

35:28.384 --> 35:30.683
And he hasn't been
for a while now.

35:30.750 --> 35:33.784
And I didn't agree
to spend the rest of my life

35:33.850 --> 35:37.384
sleeping next
to a complete stranger.

35:39.617 --> 35:44.484
* You were always
bound to fall *

35:44.550 --> 35:49.384
* there's nothing you can do *

35:51.917 --> 35:54.151
* the weight of gravity *

35:56.517 --> 35:58.617
Dude, no way
you're still up.

35:58.684 --> 36:00.284
I don't want it to end.

36:00.351 --> 36:01.718
Bed. Now.

36:01.784 --> 36:03.250
Always keeping
a brother down.

36:03.317 --> 36:04.551
Mm-hmm.

36:04.617 --> 36:08.684
* So, what are you
to do now? *

36:08.751 --> 36:09.417
All right.

36:09.484 --> 36:11.651
Hey, dad, was your 7th birthday
as good as mine?

36:14.018 --> 36:15.217
You want the truth?

36:15.283 --> 36:17.317
Dad, I'm 7.
I can handle it.

36:17.384 --> 36:20.384
Well, um...

36:20.450 --> 36:22.851
We had this big party planned
just like yours.

36:22.917 --> 36:25.317
But then Grandpa Dan
realized that there was

36:25.384 --> 36:27.717
a pee-wee basketball tournament
the same day.

36:27.784 --> 36:29.651
So we canceled the party.

36:29.717 --> 36:32.084
My team ended up
losing the game,

36:32.150 --> 36:36.118
and, uh, he didn't speak to me
for the rest of my birthday.

36:36.183 --> 36:38.384
Did you ever forgive him?

36:38.450 --> 36:41.183
I wish
I could say yes, son.

36:41.250 --> 36:43.651
But I'm not sure
I ever did.

36:43.717 --> 36:45.517
Well, I think you should.

36:45.584 --> 36:49.684
Well, you're a good man,
Jamie Scott.

36:49.751 --> 36:52.317
Good night, son.

36:52.384 --> 36:54.150
Hey, Dad?

36:54.217 --> 36:56.018
I think you're good enough
to forgive him.

36:56.084 --> 36:56.984
You're Nathan Scott.

37:03.617 --> 37:14.018
* Is it starting to break
underneath my feet? *

37:14.084 --> 37:15.784
Forgiveness is never easy.

37:15.851 --> 37:18.051
* You're so far away *

37:18.118 --> 37:22.350
Bitterness is easy.
Hatred is easy.

37:22.417 --> 37:27.051
But forgiveness,
that's a tough one.

37:27.118 --> 37:30.018
Sometimes, people say things
they don't mean

37:30.084 --> 37:32.450
or do things
they can't take back.

37:32.517 --> 37:35.183
Sometimes we do things
we can't take back.

37:39.817 --> 37:42.118
So we feed ourselves
to starve the pain.

37:46.250 --> 37:49.851
* So afraid of landing *

37:52.884 --> 37:54.917
* Do we leave it all? *

37:57.717 --> 38:01.283
* Will you ever answer? *

38:01.350 --> 38:03.051
Get a list of all
the free-agent

38:03.118 --> 38:05.150
and restricted point guards
in the league

38:05.217 --> 38:07.751
and find out if the Bobcats
are talking to any of them.

38:07.817 --> 38:09.917
Call that kid
from Arkansas.

38:09.984 --> 38:13.450
Set up a meeting
to discuss representation.

38:18.118 --> 38:20.517
Saturday is the 14th.

38:24.450 --> 38:26.684
Send flowers.

38:28.984 --> 38:32.317
We're all afraid of something.

38:32.384 --> 38:34.984
I'm scared.

38:37.717 --> 38:40.217
What if we ruin it?

38:40.283 --> 38:43.283
What are you
talking about?

38:43.350 --> 38:48.917
The feeling that I get
when I see you after a month.

38:48.984 --> 38:52.484
And the way my heart aches
when I smell your skin.

38:52.550 --> 38:55.051
I don't want it
to go away.

38:55.118 --> 38:57.317
It won't.

38:57.384 --> 38:59.851
We won't let it.

39:05.550 --> 39:08.751
* So I cannot find you *

39:08.817 --> 39:11.384
* I'm walking like I'm blinded *

39:11.450 --> 39:13.584
I was afraid.

39:13.651 --> 39:15.717
I was dying.

39:15.784 --> 39:20.150
But in the face of great
despair, I had an epiphany --

39:20.217 --> 39:23.751
What I've done is who I am.

39:23.817 --> 39:27.150
But what I've done
is not who I'll be.

39:32.684 --> 39:37.550
* Is it starting to break... *

39:39.384 --> 39:40.951
Hey, you.

39:43.517 --> 39:45.584
Come to bed.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.384
I'll make it
worth your while.

39:47.450 --> 39:51.550
I can't. Uh...
actually, I got to go.

39:51.617 --> 39:54.018
You can sleep here...
or I'll see you later.

39:56.118 --> 39:58.283
Wow, nothing like love
at first sight.

40:00.651 --> 40:03.084
I don't believe in love.

40:04.917 --> 40:10.350
It's been nearly
37 million seconds --

40:10.417 --> 40:15.217
10,000 hours, 14 months --

40:15.283 --> 40:20.917
Since I realized what I've done
is not who I can be.

40:20.984 --> 40:23.784
Unburden yourself from
the mistakes of your past.

40:23.851 --> 40:29.684
And when you do,
your heart grows stronger.

40:29.751 --> 40:32.384
I should know.

40:32.450 --> 40:35.150
Mine was supposed to go out
a long time ago.

40:45.984 --> 40:50.084
<i>It doesn't mean
what you've done is forgotten.</i>

40:50.150 --> 40:53.150
It's 4:30
in the morning, Clay.

40:53.217 --> 40:54.984
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

40:55.051 --> 40:56.584
What's going on?

40:59.051 --> 41:00.584
Does that girl
look familiar to you?

41:04.150 --> 41:07.018
Yeah, she was at
the party today. Why?

41:07.084 --> 41:10.884
She says she slept with you
on the road, Nate.

41:10.951 --> 41:13.417
<i>What you've done
is out there.</i>

41:13.484 --> 41:16.617
And she's going public.

41:16.618 --> 41:17.618
And what you've done remembers.

41:17.684 --> 41:20.484
