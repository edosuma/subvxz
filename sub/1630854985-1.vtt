02:17.378 --> 02:18.355
- Hello, Agent Prasad.

02:18.379 --> 02:19.667
- Dade, how are you?

02:19.691 --> 02:21.565
- I'm good, how about you?

02:21.589 --> 02:22.808
- Oh, I'm doing pretty good.

02:22.832 --> 02:23.947
- That was a lovely dance.

02:23.971 --> 02:25.362
What were you doing?

02:25.386 --> 02:28.192
- Oh, I was practicing my
dance for my brother's wedding.

02:28.216 --> 02:29.711
- Cool.

02:29.735 --> 02:31.989
- So what article are you
working on for the LA Times?

02:32.013 --> 02:34.613
- I'm now a journalist
for the Hollywood Reporter

02:34.637 --> 02:37.098
with a little informant
work on the side.

02:37.122 --> 02:39.480
- Well, that sounds interesting.

02:39.504 --> 02:42.759
- Thank you, and I
thought you should know

02:42.783 --> 02:44.588
that Dalton is back in town.

02:44.612 --> 02:47.798
- Really, when did he come back?

02:47.822 --> 02:50.146
- Just about
a couple days ago.

02:50.170 --> 02:55.175
- Ah, well, this
is very interesting

02:55.934 --> 02:57.877
and very intriguing.

02:57.901 --> 02:59.327
Thanks for the information, Dade

02:59.351 --> 03:00.570
- No problem.

03:00.594 --> 03:05.230
- Bye.

03:31.970 --> 03:34.731
- Hey, pop, how you doing?

03:37.043 --> 03:39.046
Sorry I haven't been
around for a while.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.956
Just had to get away
after Mr. Tang shot

03:41.980 --> 03:43.257
and killed you a year ago.

03:45.777 --> 03:47.779
Now, I'm back.

03:49.677 --> 03:50.999
I remember the first
time you told me

03:51.023 --> 03:52.542
you were a robotics engineer.

03:55.269 --> 03:58.869
My first thought was you
operated those Johnny five robots

03:58.893 --> 04:00.619
from the movie, Short Circuit.

04:01.965 --> 04:02.966
Pretty close, right?

04:06.349 --> 04:07.671
I thought that was
the coolest thing

04:07.695 --> 04:09.639
when you took me to
the automobile plant,

04:09.663 --> 04:11.848
and I would watch you
operate robots welding car

04:11.872 --> 04:12.872
and truck parts.

04:16.980 --> 04:20.639
You know, I wanted to
be just like you, pop.

04:21.640 --> 04:22.640
You were my hero.

04:24.056 --> 04:26.207
I wanted to be a
robotics engineer.

04:26.231 --> 04:30.522
I wanted to be a
welder like you,

04:30.546 --> 04:33.134
until the automobile
plant shut down,

04:34.550 --> 04:38.761
you lost your job, mom went
crazy and killed herself.

04:42.627 --> 04:45.561
You know, I ask myself all
the time, just what if?

04:46.803 --> 04:48.505
What if you would've just stayed

04:48.529 --> 04:50.290
in the unemployment line, pop?

04:52.533 --> 04:54.649
What if you didn't meet
Mob Boss Johnny Nero

04:54.673 --> 04:56.296
or accept his bloody money?

04:58.056 --> 04:59.159
We would've been okay.

05:00.783 --> 05:02.923
You would've gotten
another job eventually,

05:04.338 --> 05:07.307
and I think you and I would
be fishing right now together,

05:09.999 --> 05:12.312
but I guess that'll
never happen,

05:15.901 --> 05:17.489
not in this lifetime, anyway,

05:20.837 --> 05:24.910
but on that note, at least
you accepted Jesus Christ

05:29.225 --> 05:33.091
as your personal savior, and
you asked for forgiveness.

05:37.820 --> 05:42.100
So that being said, I'll see
you in heaven someday, pop.

05:51.212 --> 05:52.421
See you around.

06:31.805 --> 06:34.508
- Dalton, what are you doing?

06:34.532 --> 06:35.854
- Agent Prasad?

06:35.878 --> 06:37.234
- Yeah.

06:37.258 --> 06:39.260
- As I live and breathe.

06:43.332 --> 06:45.519
- Why are you trying to
throw away your dog tags?

06:45.543 --> 06:46.520
You earned them.

06:46.544 --> 06:48.453
- I don't want 'em anymore.

06:48.477 --> 06:51.870
I thought if I get
rid of these dog tags,

06:51.894 --> 06:55.149
just maybe I can
move on with my life.

06:55.173 --> 06:57.013
- Are you still
having nightmares

06:57.037 --> 06:59.153
and flashbacks about the war?

06:59.177 --> 07:00.810
- Can't stop having them.

07:00.834 --> 07:02.984
I keep seeing the Taliban
and Al-Qaeda chasing me,

07:03.008 --> 07:05.815
trying to kill me, and I keep
seeing my best friend getting

07:05.839 --> 07:07.955
killed on the battlefield.

07:07.979 --> 07:10.740
These images haunt
me every single day.

07:13.053 --> 07:14.686
- Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

07:14.710 --> 07:16.688
Please don't give up.

07:16.712 --> 07:19.035
You're making progress.

07:19.059 --> 07:23.177
So I have something that
could maybe take your mind off

07:23.201 --> 07:26.214
of your flashbacks and the
nightmares that you're having.

07:26.238 --> 07:27.343
I have a new case.

07:28.724 --> 07:30.943
- Do I have to pass another
one of your field tests?

07:30.967 --> 07:34.326
- No, Dalton, you already
passed my field tests.

07:34.350 --> 07:38.019
So have you ever heard
of the Lunada Bay Gang?

07:38.043 --> 07:40.159
- Yeah, I heard of them.

07:40.183 --> 07:43.300
- Okay, yeah, so what they're
doing is they're distributing

07:43.324 --> 07:46.890
this crystallized
cocaine called Galaxy,

07:46.914 --> 07:49.790
and they're distributing
it through the surfers

07:49.814 --> 07:53.966
all over Southern California,
and a lot of them are dying.

07:53.990 --> 07:56.072
- I thought Galaxy's
the new big high

07:56.096 --> 07:59.385
with less side effects, and
besides, I killed Mr. Tang.

07:59.409 --> 08:02.458
He was the only Triad leader
who had access to the drug,

08:02.482 --> 08:04.701
who brought it
here to the States.

08:04.725 --> 08:08.360
- I don't know, but somehow
it is being distributed here,

08:08.384 --> 08:11.190
and surfers are ending up dead.

08:11.214 --> 08:14.504
- So when does this
fairy tale begin?

08:14.528 --> 08:16.254
- It's effective immediately.

08:17.635 --> 08:21.269
I need you to find out
who are the distributors,

08:21.293 --> 08:25.170
to get the evidence so that
I can have enough information

08:25.194 --> 08:28.760
to get a warrant so that I can
put these people behind bars

08:28.784 --> 08:30.889
who are killing so
many of these surfers.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.765
- Okay.

08:34.789 --> 08:37.493
- And by the way,
this surfer gang,

08:37.517 --> 08:39.874
they hate undercover agents.

08:39.898 --> 08:42.876
We're still missing
five narcotics agents.

08:42.900 --> 08:46.536
They won't hesitate to
kill you if you're made.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.882
So you have to be careful.

08:47.906 --> 08:50.367
- Yeah, I know how it works.

08:50.391 --> 08:51.955
I understand.

08:51.979 --> 08:56.097
- Well, all of the
information is in the packet.

08:56.121 --> 08:57.547
- Okay.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.135
- And by the way, Dalton,

08:59.159 --> 09:01.517
thank you so much
for your service.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.932
I know you brought down a lot

09:02.956 --> 09:06.176
of those Middle East terrorists
that were responsible

09:06.200 --> 09:09.031
for 3,000 deaths during 9/11.

09:11.999 --> 09:13.736
- Of course.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.876
It's my duty to fight
for those who can't fight

09:15.900 --> 09:16.901
for themselves.

09:18.074 --> 09:20.259
- Well, you're never
out of the fight.

09:20.283 --> 09:23.010
- No, I'm never
out of the fight.

09:34.712 --> 09:35.712
- Mother.

09:36.714 --> 09:38.830
- Tiger, what are
you doing here?

09:38.854 --> 09:40.452
You're supposed to be in Mumbai.

09:40.476 --> 09:43.455
- I'm here to take
over father's business.

09:43.479 --> 09:44.939
- What are you gonna do?

09:44.963 --> 09:47.804
- The first thing I'm gonna
do is avenge my father's death

09:47.828 --> 09:49.288
by killing Dalton.

09:49.312 --> 09:53.361
The last time I spoke to father,
he told me, join me or die.

09:53.385 --> 09:57.193
I chose to join him, but Dalton,
he chose to go against him.

09:57.217 --> 09:59.471
Now father is dead
because of Dalton.

09:59.495 --> 10:01.646
- Tiger, I beg you
to let this go.

10:01.670 --> 10:04.718
Let Match-Stick's flame die out.

10:04.742 --> 10:07.203
Dalton took down the
syndicate and father

10:07.227 --> 10:08.653
because he did his job.

10:08.677 --> 10:12.208
Match-Stick chose his path
and it killed him, not Dalton.

10:12.232 --> 10:14.106
Dalton will come after you too.

10:14.130 --> 10:17.454
- I must fulfill father's
wishes and kill Dalton.

10:17.478 --> 10:19.111
I must leave now.

10:19.135 --> 10:20.941
- Tiger, no, please.

10:20.965 --> 10:22.494
No more death.

10:22.518 --> 10:25.210
I wanted a better life for
you, not a life of crime.

10:50.270 --> 10:52.928
- Hey man, what do you think
you're doing around here?

10:54.723 --> 10:58.254
No outsiders are
aloud here, dude.

10:58.278 --> 11:01.498
- Yeah, well last I checked
this is a free country.

11:01.522 --> 11:02.938
- Get outta here, you turd.

11:07.425 --> 11:10.531
- How about, no,
I stay and you go.

11:19.092 --> 11:20.001
- I gotta go.

11:20.025 --> 11:21.542
Let me call you back, bye.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.078
Dalton, we need to talk.

11:29.102 --> 11:30.320
- About what?

11:30.344 --> 11:31.528
- Why'd you kick that
surfer in the face?

11:31.552 --> 11:33.565
- You gave me
permission to play rough

11:33.589 --> 11:35.325
on the streets, Remember?

11:35.349 --> 11:37.258
- OMG.

11:37.282 --> 11:38.466
- It's time for breakfast.

11:38.490 --> 11:39.467
Let's get a bite to eat.

11:39.491 --> 11:40.491
- All right.

11:56.198 --> 11:57.440
- Let the case begin.

13:06.475 --> 13:07.797
- Are you crazy?

13:07.821 --> 13:09.695
These coves have her
experienced surfers.

13:09.719 --> 13:12.353
You almost got yourself
killed out there.

13:12.377 --> 13:13.551
- I have a death wish.

13:14.966 --> 13:17.289
These coves are
open to everybody.

13:17.313 --> 13:18.901
- No, they're not.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.190
Locals run things here.

13:21.214 --> 13:25.573
You have to earn your spot
here, especially at Lunada Bay.

13:25.597 --> 13:28.335
- Okay, so why aren't you
surfing at Lunada Bay?

13:28.359 --> 13:32.926
- I'm not that good, but this
isn't my first rodeo either,

13:32.950 --> 13:35.618
and even I have to earn my spot.

13:35.642 --> 13:40.647
- What is so special
about surfing at Lunada Bay?

13:41.510 --> 13:42.694
- It's a locals thing, really.

13:42.718 --> 13:45.317
It all started
back in the 1930s,

13:45.341 --> 13:49.114
and this group of young
surfers got together,

13:49.138 --> 13:51.358
and they created what's
called the Palos Verde Surfers

13:51.382 --> 13:55.603
Club, and it was all just for
fun and surf and friendship,

13:55.627 --> 13:59.641
and then this group of young
trust fund babies came along,

13:59.665 --> 14:02.921
and they started what's
called the Lunada Bay Gang,

14:02.945 --> 14:05.268
then they began bullying
the non-locals away,

14:05.292 --> 14:08.478
and now anyone who attempts
to surf here that's not part

14:08.502 --> 14:13.059
of the gang either winds
up missing or ends up dead.

14:16.821 --> 14:19.558
- Why do you want to
join the Bay Gang anyway?

14:19.582 --> 14:23.769
- Well, my grandfather
and my father surfed

14:23.793 --> 14:24.874
this spot before me.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.427
It's a family tradition,

14:26.451 --> 14:28.902
and I want to be able
to surf this spot too,

14:30.835 --> 14:33.676
and I want to find
the man responsible

14:33.700 --> 14:36.921
for murdering my father,
and I know it's someone

14:36.945 --> 14:37.945
in that gang.

14:39.637 --> 14:40.810
- I know the feeling.

14:42.433 --> 14:44.998
- So why do you wanna
surf here anyway?

14:45.022 --> 14:47.759
- Well, I have nothing to lose.

14:47.783 --> 14:49.761
Both my parents are now dead.

14:49.785 --> 14:51.694
My fiance was
murdered a year ago.

14:51.718 --> 14:54.904
So I figured why not
try something different,

14:54.928 --> 14:56.412
something to free my spirit.

14:57.448 --> 14:58.656
- Oh, I'm sorry.

14:59.657 --> 15:00.657
- Thanks.

15:01.693 --> 15:04.362
- Well, I see
you're a vet also.

15:04.386 --> 15:08.090
- Oh yeah, oh,
Special Ops Forces.

15:08.114 --> 15:10.023
- Wow,
you're a Navy Seal?

15:10.047 --> 15:11.576
- Yeah.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.027
- You really are crazy
then, huh?

15:14.051 --> 15:17.616
- Well, maybe just a little.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.653
- I have to get going now.

15:19.677 --> 15:23.036
- Yeah, thanks for this.

15:23.060 --> 15:24.071
- You're welcome.

15:24.095 --> 15:26.177
- Hey, what's your name anyway?

15:26.201 --> 15:28.696
- Kiley, Kiley Hall.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.825
What's your last name?

15:31.102 --> 15:34.840
- Billy Bob, Billy Bob Peters.

15:36.383 --> 15:40.260
- Bob Peters, I don't picture
that as last name for you.

15:40.284 --> 15:45.289
I think more of
a Bale or a Cage.

15:47.429 --> 15:49.407
- Yeah, I like that.

15:49.431 --> 15:50.236
- Well, later.

15:50.260 --> 15:54.401
- Yeah.

16:03.203 --> 16:04.203
Hey.
- Hey.

16:05.205 --> 16:06.586
- Might have first contact.

16:08.036 --> 16:10.773
I need you to run a background
check on the name Kiley Hall.

16:10.797 --> 16:13.569
She's a local here in
the Palos Verdes estates

16:13.593 --> 16:15.985
and run a background
check on her father too.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.469
I think his murder may
have something to do

16:17.493 --> 16:18.677
with the Lunada Bay Gang.

16:18.701 --> 16:20.127
- Why do you think that?

16:20.151 --> 16:23.027
- Because Kiley Hall told me
that she wants to join the gang

16:23.051 --> 16:24.062
because she believes somebody

16:24.086 --> 16:25.891
in that gang killed her father.

16:25.915 --> 16:28.308
- Oh, okay, that makes sense.

16:28.332 --> 16:29.965
All right, I'll get
on it right away.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.380
- Great, thanks.

16:31.404 --> 16:32.405
We'll be in touch.

16:36.443 --> 16:37.662
Sorry I'm late.

16:37.686 --> 16:39.940
The 110 was backed
up with traffic.

16:39.964 --> 16:41.079
- Oh, no problem.

16:41.103 --> 16:42.103
No worries.

16:43.347 --> 16:47.489
So I got the information that
you wanted about Kiley Hall.

16:48.904 --> 16:52.194
Inside this file, you
will find that Kiley Hall

16:52.218 --> 16:54.851
is the daughter of Patrick Hall,

16:54.875 --> 16:59.028
and her grandfather's
name is Warren Doc Hall.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.650
- So what did these
people have to do

17:00.674 --> 17:02.031
with the Lunada Bay Gang?

17:02.055 --> 17:07.060
- So it's the newer
generations of the Bay Boys.

17:08.165 --> 17:09.589
They're the ones
that grew up corrupt,

17:09.614 --> 17:12.454
and they were very
unfriendly to anyone

17:12.479 --> 17:14.733
that didn't belong
there who would come

17:14.757 --> 17:19.762
into their territory, and
if you didn't pay a tax

17:20.901 --> 17:23.880
or listen to what they
were saying to do,

17:23.904 --> 17:25.227
they would end up dead.

17:25.251 --> 17:28.116
So in 2019, surfers
started ending up dead.

17:29.393 --> 17:31.257
- So what happened
to Kiley's father?

17:32.465 --> 17:37.297
- Kiley's father ended
up dying in 2010.

17:38.436 --> 17:42.209
The case file says
that it was a suicide.

17:42.233 --> 17:45.764
However, there's really
no reason for him

17:45.788 --> 17:47.963
to jump off Pelican Cove Cliff.

17:49.102 --> 17:52.288
So this is the suicide
note that he wrote.

17:52.312 --> 17:53.312
- Okay.

18:03.392 --> 18:06.475
Okay, I get it.

18:06.499 --> 18:09.236
Sounds like a case of
rich, over-privileged,

18:09.260 --> 18:12.170
trust fund pieces of garbage
who took a family clubhouse

18:12.194 --> 18:15.725
pass-down and turned it
into a big drug operation.

18:15.749 --> 18:18.866
- Exactly, the police here,

18:18.890 --> 18:21.006
they don't think that
there's anything wrong

18:21.030 --> 18:22.215
with the Bay Boys.

18:22.239 --> 18:24.665
They think that it's
just a dumb click,

18:25.622 --> 18:27.012
But that's not the facts.

18:27.036 --> 18:28.255
- Right.

18:28.279 --> 18:31.293
- So what I need you to
do is collect evidence.

18:31.317 --> 18:34.986
I need you to find out
who the distributors are,

18:35.010 --> 18:37.506
and I need you to get
me back this information

18:37.530 --> 18:41.096
so we can take down these
scumbags, and remember,

18:41.120 --> 18:44.616
you cannot commit any felonies.

18:46.021 --> 18:48.506
If you do, this
operation gets shut down.

18:49.921 --> 18:53.660
- Oh, okay, I understand.

18:53.684 --> 18:55.064
Do my best.
- Okay.

19:06.835 --> 19:10.366
- Kiley, you ready to
join our gang or what?

19:10.390 --> 19:12.057
- I am.

19:12.081 --> 19:14.267
- Let's see what you got.

20:12.935 --> 20:15.811
Excellent surfing
out there, Kiley.

20:15.835 --> 20:18.089
Your father would be proud.

20:18.113 --> 20:20.471
- You know I'm still looking
for my father's killer.

20:20.495 --> 20:22.783
<font size="41">{\an1-}- Sounds like
somebody has daddy issues.

20:22.807 --> 20:25.776
- Happy hunting, Kiley.

20:26.915 --> 20:29.859
- So am I part of
your bay gang or what?

20:29.883 --> 20:32.231
- No, you're not in
the gang, Mickey.

20:33.439 --> 20:36.763
- What the, you respect
my board on this beach.

20:36.787 --> 20:39.755
- Nobody surfs with a
leash on in the bay.

20:46.279 --> 20:48.361
- There's one more test.

20:48.385 --> 20:50.363
- I thought this was
a locals-only test?

20:50.387 --> 20:52.054
- We run the business
a lot differently

20:52.078 --> 20:53.907
than your grandfather
and father did,

20:54.805 --> 20:56.185
the stakes are higher.

20:57.394 --> 20:59.268
We like to be sketchy!

20:59.292 --> 21:02.098
- Wooh!

21:02.122 --> 21:04.204
- What exactly do I have to do?

21:04.228 --> 21:06.989
- The real test is
just beginning, Kiley.

21:20.382 --> 21:21.382
- Lex.

21:22.522 --> 21:24.155
- Kiley.
- Yeah.

21:24.179 --> 21:25.846
- I'm surprised you showed up.

21:25.870 --> 21:27.296
- I'm here.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.815
- You ready for your final test?

21:28.839 --> 21:29.943
- What is this test?

21:31.255 --> 21:32.255
- Wolf.

21:35.880 --> 21:36.985
- Here it is, boss.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.586
- What is this?

21:41.610 --> 21:42.610
- Mickey.

21:47.789 --> 21:49.870
- You ready for your
final test, Kiley?

21:49.894 --> 21:50.895
- I don't understand.

21:52.207 --> 21:54.140
- Are you in or are you out?

21:57.661 --> 21:59.224
- I don't understand.

21:59.248 --> 22:02.400
I don't, no, no, my family
didn't start the bay gang

22:02.424 --> 22:05.738
in the 1930s to kill
innocent people.

22:06.773 --> 22:07.682
- Do it!

22:07.706 --> 22:10.581
- No, I'm not killing anyone!

22:10.605 --> 22:12.686
- You're not gonna get
away with this, Lex,

22:12.710 --> 22:14.895
20 years to life.

22:14.919 --> 22:16.093
I have a wife.

22:17.474 --> 22:18.314
I have a kid.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.453
- No, don't kill him!

22:22.927 --> 22:27.425
- Which one
of you killed my father?

22:27.449 --> 22:28.289
- I did it!

22:28.313 --> 22:29.910
I killed him!

22:29.934 --> 22:30.934
- Why?

22:31.971 --> 22:34.846
- Because he didn't have
the balls or the brains.

22:34.870 --> 22:37.642
He wasn't going in the
same direction, Kiley.

22:37.666 --> 22:40.117
We run the bay a little
bit differently now.

22:55.477 --> 22:58.283
There's nothing more
powerful than killing a man!

22:58.307 --> 22:59.307
Take him away!

23:09.388 --> 23:10.399
- Give me your arm.
- No.

23:10.423 --> 23:11.332
- Give it up!

23:11.356 --> 23:12.850
- Please don't do this.

23:12.874 --> 23:13.714
Guys, please don't do this.
- You don't want

23:13.738 --> 23:14.886
to make my arm slip.

23:14.910 --> 23:16.843
- Please don't do this.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.709
- Welcome to the gang.

23:31.168 --> 23:31.972
- I gotta go.

23:31.996 --> 23:32.996
I'll call you back.

23:34.654 --> 23:36.242
Dalton, are you okay?

23:37.519 --> 23:38.693
- No, I'm not okay.

23:39.521 --> 23:40.557
It's Kiley Hall.

23:42.006 --> 23:44.882
I just met this woman a few
days ago at Malcolm Cove.

23:44.906 --> 23:48.472
She was the only lead we had
so far, and now she's dead.

23:48.496 --> 23:50.059
- Are you kidding?

23:50.083 --> 23:51.188
- No, I'm not kidding.

23:52.051 --> 23:54.512
- I'm sorry she's dead.

23:54.536 --> 23:55.962
Did she drown?

23:55.986 --> 23:58.965
- No, she didn't drown.

23:58.989 --> 24:00.059
Here, come here, look.

24:06.030 --> 24:08.423
See the needle marks on her arm?

24:08.447 --> 24:10.483
- Yes, I do see
the needle marks.

24:11.933 --> 24:14.705
- We need to get an autopsy
report on her right away.

24:14.729 --> 24:16.292
- Yeah, I agree.

24:16.316 --> 24:19.157
- She was a good
swimmer and surfer, too.

24:19.181 --> 24:22.540
All she wanted to do was find
out who murdered her father.

24:22.564 --> 24:24.818
She knew it was someone
in that Lunada Bay Gang

24:24.842 --> 24:27.234
but just didn't know
exactly who did it.

24:27.258 --> 24:30.652
- Yeah, we really need to get
cracking on this case as soon

24:30.676 --> 24:32.988
as possible, 'cause we're
running out of time.

24:34.300 --> 24:35.300
- Yeah.

24:56.218 --> 24:59.232
- Gentlemen, I'm
glad you could make it.

24:59.256 --> 25:02.708
- Here you go, clear cut
Galaxy straight from China.

25:04.088 --> 25:06.273
You must have some strong
connections to be doing business

25:06.297 --> 25:08.034
with me, my man.

25:08.058 --> 25:09.173
I don't recognize you.

25:09.197 --> 25:10.657
You with the Hollywood mob?

25:10.681 --> 25:11.681
You a new runner?

25:19.587 --> 25:20.909
- I'm not a runner.

25:20.933 --> 25:23.832
The name is Tiger,
Tiger Match-Stick.

25:26.007 --> 25:27.916
- You just say Match-Stick?

25:27.940 --> 25:29.573
- Did I stutter?

25:29.597 --> 25:31.264
- But you're Indian, bro.

25:31.288 --> 25:33.128
- Yeah, I'm half Indian.

25:33.152 --> 25:35.199
Match-Stick had an
affair with my mother

25:35.223 --> 25:38.651
while he was making his run
with Mob Boss Johnny Nero

25:38.675 --> 25:40.204
in the late eighties.

25:40.228 --> 25:41.436
So I am Match-Stick.

25:42.851 --> 25:44.933
- I heard he got killed
by the Triads a year ago.

25:44.957 --> 25:47.304
I do know that one of
his sons is a detective,

25:48.512 --> 25:49.869
but all I could find
were pictures of him

25:49.893 --> 25:53.286
when he was a young boy
before his disappearance

25:53.310 --> 25:56.278
after the FBI took
Match-Stick away.

25:57.970 --> 26:01.525
- I run Bollywood and
now I run Hollywood.

26:02.906 --> 26:05.425
- I hate to burst your bubble,
but we were on Hollywood.

26:06.565 --> 26:09.544
I respect the name
Match-Stick and all,

26:09.568 --> 26:10.983
but that name's of the past.

26:24.237 --> 26:25.836
- The fact that I'm
Match-Stick's son,

26:25.860 --> 26:28.390
and it's in his will
that I take over.

26:28.414 --> 26:30.530
I claim power over
Hollywood now.

26:30.554 --> 26:31.463
Is that understood?

26:31.487 --> 26:34.247
- Okay, okay, no problem.

26:35.663 --> 26:37.192
Well, can we negotiate?

26:37.216 --> 26:39.677
- I don't think you're in any
position to negotiate with me.

26:39.701 --> 26:40.782
- Let's just talk, man.

26:40.806 --> 26:42.773
I got a plan, help you out.

26:52.541 --> 26:55.037
Listen, we have
all the contacts,

26:55.061 --> 26:57.719
and we have the power
for all the distribution.

26:59.203 --> 27:01.388
Let us keep that power over
all the Southern California

27:01.412 --> 27:02.759
beaches and coves.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.358
We can partner up, my man.

27:05.382 --> 27:08.178
You run the Hollywood
streets, we do the coastlines.

27:09.248 --> 27:11.571
It'd be good business
for everybody.

27:11.595 --> 27:12.976
- You do make a valid point.

27:14.391 --> 27:15.391
- But Lex?

27:16.531 --> 27:17.532
- Trust me, Mickey.

27:18.637 --> 27:19.637
This will be good.

27:39.347 --> 27:42.661
- Dude, where'd you
get that board, man?

27:43.834 --> 27:46.043
I want to know where
did you get this board?

27:47.666 --> 27:49.091
- Hands off me, man.

27:49.115 --> 27:50.334
What're you talking about?

27:50.358 --> 27:51.198
I bought this board
with my own money.

27:51.222 --> 27:52.681
- You're a nark, nark!

27:52.705 --> 27:53.545
- What's going on, bro?

27:53.569 --> 27:54.614
Who are you?

27:54.638 --> 27:55.547
- This guy's a nark, man.

27:55.571 --> 27:57.721
This is my brother's board.

27:57.745 --> 27:58.929
He was pinched for narcotics

27:58.953 --> 28:00.437
and was confiscated
two months ago.

28:06.029 --> 28:11.034
- That's his brother's board!

28:30.570 --> 28:32.548
All right, all
right, that's enough.

28:32.572 --> 28:35.586
- I hate narks, man, hate
these undercover narks!

28:35.610 --> 28:37.001
- Hate cops.

28:37.025 --> 28:38.313
Let's get outta here, man.

28:38.337 --> 28:39.659
Let's go, let's go.

28:39.683 --> 28:41.937
Hey, man, you want to go
grab something to eat?

28:50.142 --> 28:53.052
- Have you completely
lost your mind?

28:53.076 --> 28:55.640
You almost killed
one of my agents.

28:55.664 --> 28:57.677
- Hey, if I haven't stepped
in and kicked the crap

28:57.701 --> 28:59.161
out of that undercover agent,

28:59.185 --> 29:00.818
the Bay Boys
would've killed him.

29:00.842 --> 29:02.475
I saved that man's life.

29:02.499 --> 29:04.822
You have no idea,
and on top of that,

29:04.846 --> 29:07.445
he went in with a confiscated
surfboard that belonged

29:07.469 --> 29:10.448
to one of the Lunada Bay
Gang member's brother,

29:10.472 --> 29:12.519
real smooth agent Prasad.

29:12.543 --> 29:14.452
We're off to a great start!

29:14.476 --> 29:16.592
- Well, I was just trying
to help with this case.

29:16.616 --> 29:19.319
- Like I told you before,
I like to work alone.

29:19.343 --> 29:22.806
This way, if I screw up,
it's just me who gets killed.

29:22.830 --> 29:25.187
You know the one thing that
kept me alive during my tours

29:25.211 --> 29:26.879
in the Middle East was
that I didn't think

29:26.903 --> 29:28.397
about the world back home.

29:28.421 --> 29:31.159
I didn't think about mommy and
daddy having relationships,

29:31.183 --> 29:34.058
getting married, having
kids, living in a big house

29:34.082 --> 29:35.750
with a white, picket fence.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.614
I didn't think about any of
that, because if I would have,

29:38.638 --> 29:40.858
I would've gotten
distracted and killed,

29:40.882 --> 29:42.584
and I've seen it happen.

29:42.608 --> 29:44.482
What I'm saying to
you, Agent Prasad,

29:44.506 --> 29:49.073
is that I'm 100% involved
and committed to this case.

29:49.097 --> 29:50.695
- Okay, that sounds good.

29:50.719 --> 29:52.214
That's what I want to hear.

29:52.238 --> 29:53.412
- Don't worry about it.

29:54.309 --> 29:55.794
I'm going back to work.

30:29.103 --> 30:30.656
- Get off my wave, man.

30:45.119 --> 30:46.579
- Is this the punk?

30:46.603 --> 30:48.563
- That's the dude who tried
to cut me off my wave.

30:49.986 --> 30:51.204
- I get it.

30:51.228 --> 30:53.344
This is a whole
local thing, right?

30:53.368 --> 30:55.622
I'm surfing on your territory.

30:55.646 --> 30:56.727
I'm sorry, man.

30:56.751 --> 30:58.487
I don't want any problems, okay?

30:58.511 --> 30:59.764
It's not like I
went to your house

30:59.788 --> 31:01.663
and took a crap on
your lawn or something.

31:01.687 --> 31:03.665
- It's close enough, bro.

31:03.689 --> 31:05.356
- Listen, bullhead, the land

31:05.380 --> 31:07.220
and the ocean is
open to everybody.

31:07.244 --> 31:08.843
So why don't you
guys just walk away

31:08.867 --> 31:10.396
so none of you get hurt?

31:10.420 --> 31:12.363
I haven't had my
breakfast this morning.

31:12.387 --> 31:14.779
You know what happens when
I don't get my breakfast

31:14.803 --> 31:15.608
in the morning?

31:15.632 --> 31:16.541
- What?

31:16.565 --> 31:19.232
- I get real grumpy, like this.

31:30.302 --> 31:31.106
- Back off, Leo!

31:31.130 --> 31:31.935
He's with me!

31:31.959 --> 31:32.867
- Leave it, Lex.

31:32.891 --> 31:33.834
You know if this was your turf,

31:33.858 --> 31:35.755
you'd be doing the same thing.

31:40.864 --> 31:44.395
- Say goodnight!

31:44.419 --> 31:48.907
- Let's get outta here, man,
before the cops get here.

31:54.429 --> 31:55.959
- Okay, Detective,
you're all set.

31:55.983 --> 31:57.512
I'm gonna leave
you some medicine

31:57.536 --> 31:58.858
for your pain.
- Thanks.

31:58.882 --> 32:00.066
- Take that every
four hours, okay?

32:00.090 --> 32:01.333
- Yeah, yeah.

32:02.299 --> 32:03.656
- You gotta watch your limits.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.520
You gotta know what
your limits are.

32:05.544 --> 32:08.350
You gotta limit what you're
doing out in the field, okay?

32:08.374 --> 32:09.720
- I have no limits.

32:11.101 --> 32:13.148
- That's gonna be your downfall.

32:13.172 --> 32:17.083
- The mind could subjugate
anything, even real pain.

32:17.107 --> 32:19.051
- Detective, take
your medication.

32:19.075 --> 32:21.398
You're absolutely insane.

32:21.422 --> 32:24.919
- Yeah, well, I left my sanity
back at the war on terror.

32:24.943 --> 32:25.954
- Call me when you need me.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.645
You know I'm there for you.

32:27.669 --> 32:29.924
- Great, thanks, Doc.

32:38.749 --> 32:43.754
- Dalton, two surfers are in
the hospital because of you.

32:44.928 --> 32:47.493
One is in intensive
care with broken ribs

32:47.517 --> 32:49.357
and multiple contusions.

32:49.381 --> 32:51.600
Are you still fighting the war?

32:51.624 --> 32:55.225
- Yeah, I believe I was
back in the war on terror.

32:55.249 --> 32:58.953
- All right, well, you gotta
get a handle on your PTSD,

32:58.977 --> 33:01.220
because you're gonna
end up killing somebody.

33:02.428 --> 33:03.947
- Thanks for the advice.

33:04.810 --> 33:05.810
I'll try.

33:06.639 --> 33:08.641
- All right, you're welcome.

33:26.176 --> 33:27.912
- You guys ready to ride?

33:27.936 --> 33:29.731
Ready to ride with the Bay Boys?

33:30.629 --> 33:32.193
- Which gang are you from?

33:32.217 --> 33:33.321
- I'm alone.

33:34.840 --> 33:36.576
- Where are you from?

33:36.600 --> 33:38.682
- I was originally born
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,

33:38.706 --> 33:40.684
but my parents moved
me out to Los Angeles

33:40.708 --> 33:41.847
when I was real little.

33:43.297 --> 33:45.851
- Sounds like we got ourselves
of cheese head over here, huh?

33:49.924 --> 33:53.548
- Sounds like someone's
running from something, Bob.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.425
- Why do you wanna
surf all of a sudden?

33:57.449 --> 34:00.152
- I just wanted to try
something different, you know?

34:00.176 --> 34:02.419
Find my window to enlightenment.

34:03.593 --> 34:06.675
- Stick with us, bro,
and we will show you

34:06.699 --> 34:08.952
to the window of enlightenment.

34:08.976 --> 34:09.976
Let's ride.

34:12.601 --> 34:14.027
- You got the stud, man.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.052
- Yeah.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.424
- Can I trust you, man?

34:42.321 --> 34:44.402
- Of course you can trust me.

34:44.427 --> 34:47.612
You saw I took out
that undercover agent.

34:47.637 --> 34:50.547
Stupid nark, those
people make me sick.

34:50.571 --> 34:53.228
- That was inspiring, that
beating you gave that man.

34:54.954 --> 34:56.449
To new friends.

34:56.473 --> 35:00.719
<font size="41">{\an1-} To new friends, to standing
on the board, trying.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.321
I'm gonna hit the
head, finish our beers,

35:06.345 --> 35:08.047
and we'll head out, man.

35:08.071 --> 35:09.555
- All right.

35:10.660 --> 35:13.294
- Hey, Giovanni,
where's the bathrooms?

35:13.318 --> 35:14.536
- Just go straight
through the kitchen,

35:14.560 --> 35:15.710
first door on the right,

35:15.734 --> 35:16.505
- All right.
- You're all set.

35:16.529 --> 35:17.632
- Back in a few minutes.

35:29.817 --> 35:31.001
Ash?

35:31.025 --> 35:32.658
I knew I could hear
you sniffing out there.

35:32.682 --> 35:35.109
- Dalton, what are
you doing here?

35:35.133 --> 35:36.903
- I was looking for the bathroom

35:36.927 --> 35:38.974
and then I hear all this.

35:38.998 --> 35:40.700
You still doing this stuff, man?

35:40.724 --> 35:43.047
- Man, this is my
business here, all right?

35:43.071 --> 35:44.463
I got a lot of businesses.

35:44.487 --> 35:46.568
This business, this business,
they're all businesses.

35:46.592 --> 35:49.019
The shitter is over there
if you need to use it.

35:49.043 --> 35:52.056
Snorting all that cocaine, I
thought you'd be dead by now.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.128
- Look, I can see I
got a little fatter,

35:54.152 --> 35:55.750
but you got a little uglier.

35:55.774 --> 35:57.855
- What happened to Godmothers?

35:57.879 --> 35:59.409
- I own multiple businesses.

35:59.433 --> 36:01.065
See, I'm a businessman.

36:01.089 --> 36:02.964
Look, look carefully.

36:02.988 --> 36:05.829
This is what a businessman
looks like, okay?

36:05.853 --> 36:06.830
I know that's not what you do.

36:06.854 --> 36:08.107
- I see.
- You run around

36:08.131 --> 36:09.626
and like to punch
and shoot people,

36:09.650 --> 36:11.145
but I'm a businessman here.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.870
Your father still
owes me that money,

36:12.894 --> 36:14.355
and that means you
owe me that money,

36:14.379 --> 36:15.701
'cause you're related to him.

36:15.725 --> 36:16.634
You are his kid.

36:16.658 --> 36:19.073
- I don't owe you jack squat!

36:20.730 --> 36:24.917
- Well, you do now, and I
want my jack and my squat,

36:24.941 --> 36:27.161
and you can go take a squat
in the shitter over there,

36:27.185 --> 36:29.093
and when you're done,
bring me my money!

36:29.117 --> 36:34.122
- Listen, pee stain, I fought
for this country, okay?

36:34.985 --> 36:36.145
I've fought for this freedom.

36:36.470 --> 36:37.964
Get a life.

36:37.988 --> 36:40.174
- I got one, baby.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.900
It's gonna take a lot
to take me down, huh?

36:42.924 --> 36:44.937
You wanna get into
a tumble again?

36:44.961 --> 36:46.456
Let's go.

36:46.480 --> 36:47.871
Yeah, run away.

37:18.546 --> 37:20.593

your stupid rotten face.

37:20.617 --> 37:25.011
- You think you're so cool and
classy and clever, don't you?

37:25.035 --> 37:27.186
How about I come over
there and make you scream?

37:27.210 --> 37:29.913
- Sorry, pal, not without
getting your knee replaced.

37:29.937 --> 37:32.156

37:32.180 --> 37:33.710

37:35.563 --> 37:38.370
Your boy over here
disrespected my boy

37:38.394 --> 37:41.545
and beat up some of
our guys on our turf.

37:41.569 --> 37:43.651

You got my word.

37:47.162 --> 37:48.345

37:54.479 --> 37:56.388

- No problem.

This is what we do when
you step on our turf.

Bros for life, my man.

38:30.238 --> 38:31.423
Darn it!

38:31.447 --> 38:32.941
- What?

38:32.965 --> 38:34.771
- I didn't get to finish
my beer before breaking it

38:34.795 --> 38:36.255
on the owners head.

38:36.279 --> 38:37.394
- Come on, man.

38:37.418 --> 38:39.178
Let's get outta here.

Allow me.

39:13.351 --> 39:18.262
- As our guest of honor, go
ahead and take the first dip.

39:18.286 --> 39:20.057
- What is that, meth?

39:20.081 --> 39:21.542
- No, bro.

39:21.566 --> 39:22.991
That's the purest
form of cocaine.

39:23.015 --> 39:24.085
It's called Galaxy.

39:25.639 --> 39:27.537
- A fresh shipment
just came in today.

39:31.748 --> 39:33.474
- So what kind of
painting is that?

39:36.650 --> 39:37.650
Ooh, wooh!

39:42.000 --> 39:43.381
- You like that, big guy?

39:44.278 --> 39:47.084
- Wow.
- You're elite.

39:47.108 --> 39:48.178
You're one of us now.

39:51.147 --> 39:52.952
- I don't know, Lex.

39:52.976 --> 39:55.576
I kind of got my
own thing going on.

39:55.600 --> 39:58.199
Besides, I thought you only
hang out with the best surfers

39:58.223 --> 39:59.223
in the west.

40:01.122 --> 40:04.022
- Join us or die like the rest.

40:05.713 --> 40:07.543
- Oh, I heard that line before.

40:09.096 --> 40:10.580
The answer is no, Lex.

40:14.584 --> 40:16.931
- What's your real name, man?

40:18.381 --> 40:19.762
- Billy Bob Peters.

40:21.902 --> 40:22.948
So go ahead.

40:22.972 --> 40:25.778
Come on, Lex, shoot me.

40:25.802 --> 40:30.645
Let me help you, right there
in the middle of my forehead.

40:30.669 --> 40:31.669
Pull it!

40:33.016 --> 40:35.512
- Bang, bang, bang.

40:35.536 --> 40:37.341
- I'm dead.
- This guy's crazy, man.

40:37.365 --> 40:39.205
- He could be.

40:39.229 --> 40:43.130
You might be on to something,
man, a really crazy guy.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.868
- It's a party, huh?

40:46.892 --> 40:48.076
We're gonna have
some good times.

40:48.100 --> 40:48.906
Let's party.

40:48.930 --> 40:50.044
- It's a party, man.

40:50.068 --> 40:51.068
- Yeah, it is.

40:56.592 --> 40:58.328
- Hey, how's it going?

40:58.352 --> 40:59.571
- Just peachy.

40:59.595 --> 41:01.365
- So excellent work.

41:01.389 --> 41:04.438
I was able to buy us some
more time on the case,

41:04.462 --> 41:06.636
you know, before the
feds have to take over.

41:07.948 --> 41:09.926
- It's Mr. Tang's son, Bolo.

41:09.950 --> 41:11.962
He took over the
family business.

41:11.986 --> 41:13.136
- Really?

41:13.160 --> 41:14.378
- Mm hmm.

41:14.402 --> 41:16.346
- Well, at least we know
that Galaxy has stayed

41:16.370 --> 41:17.796
within the family.

41:17.820 --> 41:20.523
So now that we know who
the distributors are,

41:20.547 --> 41:23.836
how are they getting this
stuff through US Customs?

41:23.860 --> 41:25.493
- Lex has contacts
there and he's paying

41:25.517 --> 41:27.461
off the US Custom agents.

41:27.485 --> 41:31.810
- Oh, so do you think
that Bolo recognizes you?

41:31.834 --> 41:33.387
Does he know who you are?

41:34.561 --> 41:36.021
- So far, the only
thing he knows is

41:36.045 --> 41:38.782
that a detective
shot his father.

41:38.806 --> 41:41.740
- Well, if he makes
you, you are a dead man.

41:42.638 --> 41:43.994
- Yeah.

41:44.018 --> 41:45.513
- So tell me about
the other Triad.

41:45.537 --> 41:46.514
- Zang?

41:46.538 --> 41:48.126
Zang is Bolo's younger brother.

41:51.025 --> 41:54.522
If they told me that Galaxy
is more organic compared

41:54.546 --> 41:58.492
to ordinary cocaine mixed
with other harmful chemicals,

41:58.516 --> 42:00.494
then why are all these
surfers turning up dead

42:00.518 --> 42:01.978
from this drug?

42:02.002 --> 42:05.188
And it's not even considered
the amount of an overdose.

42:05.212 --> 42:07.949
What I'm saying is it's
either the Bay Gang

42:07.973 --> 42:09.813
or the Triads mixing this stuff

42:09.837 --> 42:12.644
with other harmful chemicals.

42:12.668 --> 42:14.784
- I do not think
it's the Triads.

42:14.808 --> 42:17.511
It's definitely the
Lunada Bay Gang.

42:17.535 --> 42:20.721
There's fentanyl involved,
and we're investigating this.

42:20.745 --> 42:24.207
Do the Triads distribute
to other surfer gangs?

42:24.231 --> 42:26.440
- No, just the Bay Boys.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.971
Listen, I need more money.

42:29.995 --> 42:33.009
There's a big deal coming
up, and I want a piece of it.

42:33.033 --> 42:37.520
- All right, Dalton,
here's $50,000.

42:38.832 --> 42:43.043
- Great, well listen,
I better get going.

42:44.907 --> 42:46.401
Don't wanna blow my cover.

42:46.425 --> 42:49.819
- Hey, be careful
and just remember,

42:49.843 --> 42:54.813
I gave you permission to perform
misdemeanors, not felonies.

42:55.573 --> 42:56.573
- Such a party pooper.

42:59.335 --> 43:01.106
Take care, see you later.

43:01.130 --> 43:03.315
- All right, yeah, whatever.

43:28.088 --> 43:30.435
Hey, bro, glad I caught you.

43:33.127 --> 43:35.381
I'm ready to join your gang.

43:35.405 --> 43:37.684
I wanna work with you,
not just buy it for me.

43:39.133 --> 43:41.595
- Once you're a Bay Boy,
you're a Bay Boy for life.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.079
- I understand.

43:43.103 --> 43:44.701
I have some high-powered,
high-paying clientele,

43:44.725 --> 43:46.600
and they wanna do
business with us.

43:46.624 --> 43:47.797
- Can I trust you?

43:48.971 --> 43:50.455
- Yeah, you can trust me.

43:51.939 --> 43:53.285
- Give me a sec.

43:54.217 --> 43:55.217
- All right.

44:01.052 --> 44:05.549
- Sell this, but I got
one question for you.

44:05.573 --> 44:06.861
- Yeah, go ahead.

44:06.885 --> 44:08.449
- Why the sudden transformation?

44:08.473 --> 44:10.554
What'd you used to do for work?

44:10.578 --> 44:12.626
- I was a criminal
defense attorney.

44:12.650 --> 44:15.180
I kept people like
you outta jail.

44:15.204 --> 44:17.320
- Shady characters,

44:17.344 --> 44:18.839
I bet you won a
lot of settlements.

44:18.863 --> 44:20.772
That's how you have
that extra green, huh?

44:20.796 --> 44:23.188
- That, plus I'm
a trust fund kid.

44:23.212 --> 44:25.777
- That makes sense,
and one more thing.

44:25.801 --> 44:27.123
- Yeah.

44:27.147 --> 44:28.780
- Teach me those moves?

44:28.804 --> 44:31.565
- Yeah, I could teach
you some kung fu moves,

44:33.015 --> 44:35.994
if you can teach me how to
stay on that board better.

44:36.018 --> 44:37.029
I'm in.

44:37.053 --> 44:38.203
- I guess it's a fair trade.

44:38.227 --> 44:39.307
- Yeah, bro.

44:39.331 --> 44:40.240
All right.
- Let's do this.

44:40.264 --> 44:41.368
- I'm gonna go sell this.

44:47.339 --> 44:48.339
Hey.
- Hey.

44:49.376 --> 44:51.941
- Listen, I need you to
put in my personal file

44:51.965 --> 44:54.184
that I'm a criminal
defense attorney.

44:54.208 --> 44:57.878
I need fabricated certificates,
news clippings, wins.

44:57.902 --> 44:59.776
- And why do I need to do that?

44:59.800 --> 45:02.700
- Because Lex is gonna do
a background check on me.

45:03.735 --> 45:05.886
- Okay, makes sense, all right.

45:05.910 --> 45:08.164
- We're on to the
next step in our case.

45:08.188 --> 45:09.303
- Sounds good.

45:09.327 --> 45:12.513
- Talk to you later.

48:21.622 --> 48:22.622
- Coming.

48:29.009 --> 48:31.470
Prasad, what are you doing here?

48:31.494 --> 48:33.369
Did you come here to
bring me coffee or donuts

48:33.393 --> 48:35.854
or did you come here
to blow my cover?

48:35.878 --> 48:36.914
So what's going on?

48:38.294 --> 48:41.021
- Another surfer ended
up dead along the shores.

48:43.644 --> 48:46.589
- I'm really getting
sick of tired

48:46.613 --> 48:48.477
of all these surfers
turning up dead.

48:50.410 --> 48:52.170
- Yes, it was at Malaga Cove.

48:53.792 --> 48:54.792
- What happened?

48:55.553 --> 48:56.979
- It's the Bay Boys.

48:57.003 --> 49:00.327
They're mixing up the
crystals from the Triads.

49:00.351 --> 49:02.225
- What are they mixing it with?

49:02.249 --> 49:05.701
- They're mixing
it with 25I-NBOMe.

49:07.772 --> 49:10.682
Another surfer ended up dead,

49:10.706 --> 49:12.856
and the surfer's name was Wang.

49:12.880 --> 49:17.885
The toxicology report states
that it was the combination

49:19.025 --> 49:22.028
of the 25I-NBOMe
mixed with fentanyl.

49:22.960 --> 49:24.789
- What exactly is 25I-NBOMe?

49:25.721 --> 49:28.803
- It's a very dangerous drug.

49:28.827 --> 49:32.738
19 deaths have happened
so far in 10 months.

49:32.762 --> 49:35.155
It started in
Rancho Palos Verdes,

49:35.179 --> 49:38.089
and it's spreading
all along the beaches

49:38.113 --> 49:39.804
of Los Angeles County.

49:41.150 --> 49:43.473
- Okay, if the Triads
find out what Lex

49:43.497 --> 49:46.476
and his gang is doing with
their Galaxy crystals,

49:46.500 --> 49:48.709
he's dead where he stands.

49:49.917 --> 49:51.609
- It's getting too
dangerous, Dalton.

49:52.817 --> 49:54.829
I think we should
call in the feds.

49:54.853 --> 49:56.900
- Just do me a favor, all right?

49:56.924 --> 49:58.868
Don't call in the feds.

49:58.892 --> 50:03.597
- I can put an APB out on
Lex, and I think that you need

50:03.621 --> 50:06.151
to go into the witness
protection program.

50:06.175 --> 50:08.143
I have a very bad
feeling about this.

50:09.523 --> 50:13.365
- If you do that, Lex will
pull out and disappear forever.

50:13.389 --> 50:15.747
We almost have enough evidence
of this case to put him

50:15.771 --> 50:18.508
and his gang away
for a lifetime.

50:18.532 --> 50:20.752
If the feds take over now,
they're gonna ruin months

50:20.776 --> 50:24.021
of hard work and put
fingerprints all over our evidence.

50:26.299 --> 50:27.759
I just need one more day.

50:27.783 --> 50:31.935
After tomorrow, after tomorrow
when Lex introduces me

50:31.959 --> 50:34.835
to his high end clientele,
everyone's gonna be there,

50:34.859 --> 50:38.459
the investors, the Triads
are gonna be going there,

50:38.483 --> 50:40.451
a new Hollywood
crime boss is going.

50:41.831 --> 50:43.464
After tomorrow, we'll
have our full case

50:43.488 --> 50:45.363
against the Lunada Bay Gang.

50:45.387 --> 50:47.503
The judge will issue
us the warrants.

50:47.527 --> 50:51.093
We'll get the green light and
then it's open season on them,

50:51.117 --> 50:53.774
but just gimme
that one more day.

50:55.190 --> 50:59.470
- Okay, Dalton, you have
one more day and that's it.

51:01.265 --> 51:02.300
- You gotta trust me.

51:05.372 --> 51:06.372
Hey, it's me.

51:07.443 --> 51:08.938
- Hello, Dalton.

51:08.962 --> 51:12.286
- Listen, I'm on my way to
the brake and tire shop now.

51:12.310 --> 51:14.668
- Why are you going
there, Dalton?

51:14.692 --> 51:16.773
- Because Lex is starting
the meeting with the high-end

51:16.797 --> 51:21.502
clientele business investors
early, and I have to go.

51:21.526 --> 51:24.402
- Okay, wait for me to
come with Agent Mao.

51:24.426 --> 51:25.506
You need some backup.

51:25.530 --> 51:26.990
You need to listen to me.

51:27.014 --> 51:28.923
Follow my orders.

51:28.947 --> 51:31.236
- Listen, we're so close.

51:31.260 --> 51:33.400
We can finish this case today.

51:37.887 --> 51:40.935
Before the feds take
over and ruin everything.

51:40.959 --> 51:43.110
- I have a very bad
feeling about this.

51:43.134 --> 51:44.078
Just wait for me.

51:44.102 --> 51:45.585
I'm calling Agent Mao now.

51:49.175 --> 51:50.600
- I'm going.

51:50.624 --> 51:51.624
I'm going.

52:05.881 --> 52:07.124
- Welcome, gentlemen.

52:08.677 --> 52:10.275
Put this on.

52:10.299 --> 52:11.483
The fumes get pretty strong.

52:11.507 --> 52:12.726
We wouldn't want our
highest paying customer

52:12.750 --> 52:14.510
to get addicted to
drugs, would we?

52:15.718 --> 52:16.961
Right this way.

52:20.689 --> 52:23.357
All of our crystals dissolve
overnight in gasoline,

52:23.381 --> 52:25.314
rendering them
completely undetectable.

52:28.041 --> 52:30.423
Here, we have a coffee
bean filled with cocaine.

52:31.872 --> 52:35.266
Section one is cocaine right
over here, Columbia's finest.

52:35.290 --> 52:40.202
Section two, Galaxy, the new
crystal direct from China.

52:40.226 --> 52:41.651
In three, heroin.

52:41.675 --> 52:45.207
If you thought all of
these quiet, suburban teens

52:45.231 --> 52:47.854
were living quiet and easy
lives, well, think again.

52:48.993 --> 52:51.937
These young teens
and mothers, fathers,

52:51.961 --> 52:53.756
some of our highest
paying clientele.

52:54.861 --> 52:56.414
We're start in
Ranchos Palos Verdes,

52:57.450 --> 52:59.152
swamped Southern California.

52:59.176 --> 53:01.637
Now we are selling
Galaxy all over the US,

53:01.661 --> 53:06.044
which is why we've developed
a new product, Red Dragon.

53:07.908 --> 53:09.393
- What is Red Dragon?

53:11.498 --> 53:13.096
- Red dragon is a
highly addictive,

53:13.120 --> 53:14.156
pleasurable narcotic.

53:15.088 --> 53:16.088
- Which is?

53:17.470 --> 53:22.026
- Well, I'd tell you, but
then I'd have to kill each

53:22.889 --> 53:24.867
and every last one of you.

53:26.272 --> 53:28.526
- Starting with Tiger back here.

53:28.550 --> 53:31.184
- And the Triads are okay with
you distributing their Galaxy

53:31.208 --> 53:32.657
with your own narcotics.

53:34.521 --> 53:36.775
- Let's just say
it's a surprise.

53:36.799 --> 53:39.019
- I don't think the
Triads like surprises.

53:39.043 --> 53:41.055
They already killed
Mob Boss Johnny Nero

53:41.079 --> 53:42.919
and my father, Match-Stick.

53:42.943 --> 53:47.717
- Whoa, Tiger, that's why you
were invited to this party.

53:47.741 --> 53:49.950
Make sure none of
us cross the line.

53:51.400 --> 53:52.929
- Of course, we'd make you
an offer you will not want

53:52.953 --> 53:54.517
to refuse.

53:54.541 --> 53:57.071
- We have two new
delivery methods,

53:57.095 --> 54:00.133
pure Galaxy and
self-inject able needles.

54:02.273 --> 54:05.528
This is liquified Galaxy in
a bag with a needle attached.

54:05.552 --> 54:08.669
One squeeze of the bag,
pure Galaxy directly

54:08.693 --> 54:09.798
into the bloodstream.

54:12.283 --> 54:14.986
- The first shipment
of Red Dragon is ready.

54:15.010 --> 54:17.264
Waiting your call, my friend.

54:17.288 --> 54:19.473
- We are ready to
make a purchase.

54:19.497 --> 54:21.154
- Of course, of course.

54:22.535 --> 54:26.031
- I knew I'd you
here, you traitor.

54:26.055 --> 54:27.378
- Excuse me, who are you?

54:27.402 --> 54:28.620
Do I know you?

54:28.644 --> 54:30.588
- I am the worst nightmare.

54:30.612 --> 54:31.934
- Yeah, and I'm Mary Poppins!

54:31.958 --> 54:34.799
- Haha, funny man,
I have news for you.

54:34.823 --> 54:36.663
Your cover's compromised now.

54:36.687 --> 54:37.940
- Yeah, so is your face.

54:37.964 --> 54:39.252
- Hey, what's the
problem here, fellas?

54:39.276 --> 54:41.840
- This guy is a nark,
Dalton Match-Stick,

54:41.864 --> 54:46.155
son of Match-Stick, the big,
crime fighting detective.

54:46.179 --> 54:47.432
- Who recruited you?

54:47.456 --> 54:48.916
- Mr. Rogers.

54:48.940 --> 54:51.115
- Lex, our investor's leaving.

54:52.806 --> 54:54.750
- Man, I gave you
everything, most importantly,

54:54.774 --> 54:58.132
I gave you my trust,
the shirt off my back.

54:58.156 --> 54:59.858
You stepped on
your own nuts, pal.

54:59.882 --> 55:02.136
- I'm not your pal, dick face!

55:24.217 --> 55:27.196
Hey, Lex, I'm sure the
Triads will love to hear

55:27.220 --> 55:29.405
how you're mixing your
pure Galaxy crystals

55:29.429 --> 55:31.614
with other harmful
drugs and chemicals,

55:31.638 --> 55:34.020
not to mention that
locals are dying from it.

55:35.193 --> 55:36.516
- It is what it is.

55:36.540 --> 55:41.545
- Well then.

55:42.753 --> 55:43.730
- What do you want
me to do with him?

55:43.754 --> 55:45.100
- Take him to the boat.

55:58.320 --> 55:59.849
- You failed your mission.

55:59.873 --> 56:02.956
- Back off big red.

56:02.980 --> 56:03.889
- I got this.

56:03.913 --> 56:06.811
- We'll see about that.

56:16.821 --> 56:20.974
- This is Agent Prasad at
14160 Crenshaw Boulevard

56:20.998 --> 56:23.217
at the brake and tire
Shop in.

56:23.241 --> 56:24.874
I need backup immediately.

56:24.898 --> 56:25.898
Send the feds now.

56:32.527 --> 56:33.527
- Come on!

57:04.904 --> 57:05.904
- Stand him up!

57:06.837 --> 57:07.837
- Get up.

57:11.635 --> 57:14.372
- Father wanted me to kill you
if something happened to him

57:14.396 --> 57:16.650
and if you didn't join us.

57:16.674 --> 57:18.307
- You're wrong, Tiger.

57:18.331 --> 57:20.792
Father changed before he died,

57:20.816 --> 57:22.932
became a born again Christian.

57:22.956 --> 57:23.956
- You lie!

57:25.096 --> 57:25.902
Throw his ass over!

57:25.926 --> 57:27.478
- Sure thing, boss!

58:49.180 --> 58:51.814
- This is 1L90 requesting an RA

58:51.838 --> 58:53.816
at the Royal Palms State Beach.

58:53.840 --> 58:56.888
An officer is down suffering
from head injuries,

58:56.912 --> 59:01.306
unconscious at this time, and
it looks like he's gonna need

59:01.330 --> 59:03.343
some immediate
medical attention.

59:03.367 --> 59:04.793
Please respond, code three.

59:04.817 --> 59:07.278
Get that ambulance out
here as soon as possible.

59:07.302 --> 59:09.028
This is an emergency, out.

59:19.625 --> 59:20.625
- Okay.

59:25.631 --> 59:27.494
Let's see what we got.

59:35.088 --> 59:36.894
There's a lot of
insurgents down there.

59:36.918 --> 59:38.333
We're gonna get fubared now.

59:43.441 --> 59:45.133
General, hey,
we're on the clock.

59:46.203 --> 59:47.203
- I'm ready.

59:48.826 --> 59:50.424
- What did I tell you about
thinking about the world

59:50.448 --> 59:51.449
back home, man.

59:52.589 --> 59:54.083
Thinking about the
world back home,

59:54.107 --> 59:56.465
you're gonna get distracted,
all caught up in emotions

59:56.489 --> 59:57.489
and killed.

01:00:00.907 --> 01:00:04.024
- I don't think we're gonna
make it outta here alive, man.

01:00:04.048 --> 01:00:05.578
There are a hundred insurgents,

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.362
and we're the last
two of our unit.

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:11.238
- We're gonna get you back
home to your wife and daughter.

01:00:11.262 --> 01:00:13.171
We just gotta take
care of this one thing

01:00:13.195 --> 01:00:15.542
and then get back to
the rendezvous point.

01:00:17.234 --> 01:00:18.901
Do you remember Mr.
Shuffle's history class

01:00:18.925 --> 01:00:20.489
back in middle school?

01:00:20.513 --> 01:00:22.940
Remember when he told us
how 300 Spartans could hold

01:00:22.964 --> 01:00:26.081
off 100,000 to 150,000
Persians during the Battle

01:00:26.105 --> 01:00:27.105
of Thermopylae?

01:00:28.383 --> 01:00:30.603
Even though it's just you
and me left in our unit,

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:32.042
we have a fighting chance.

01:00:33.664 --> 01:00:36.080
- If I die today, I'm
glad I'm with you.

01:00:40.464 --> 01:00:41.810
- Hey, I got Rossi in sight.

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.780
- Good, take the shot and
let's get out of here.

01:00:47.816 --> 01:00:48.990
- I don't have the shot.

01:00:50.439 --> 01:00:53.142
This is Lionheart
to Fox Trot Alpha.

01:00:53.166 --> 01:00:55.282
Be advised, I have
the package in sight

01:00:55.306 --> 01:00:57.205
but no shot, no shot.

01:00:59.448 --> 01:01:02.082
There's too many innocent
people down there.

01:01:02.106 --> 01:01:03.245
- Take them all out.

01:01:04.695 --> 01:01:06.259
- Yeah, we do that, we're
gonna get Court Marshaled

01:01:06.283 --> 01:01:07.778
for murdering innocent people.

01:01:07.802 --> 01:01:09.044
We're gonna have to wait.

01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:14.474
We're too close.

01:01:14.498 --> 01:01:15.499
We gotta fall back.

01:01:18.847 --> 01:01:21.367
Fall back.

01:02:09.587 --> 01:02:12.314
- Dalton, I need
your help, help!

01:02:16.387 --> 01:02:20.816
-American!

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:25.845
- You're gonna die!

01:02:27.053 --> 01:02:29.297
- You're gonna die!

01:02:36.683 --> 01:02:38.420
No, no, no, no!

01:02:38.444 --> 01:02:42.010
- You bastards killed nearly
3,000 innocent people on 9/11.

01:02:42.034 --> 01:02:44.322
On behalf of the United
States of America,

01:02:44.346 --> 01:02:47.153
I pledge allegiance
to the flag.

01:02:53.631 --> 01:02:57.083
Chandler, Chandler,
stay with me, breathe.

01:03:05.298 --> 01:03:06.655
Come on, Dalton.

01:03:06.679 --> 01:03:08.830
You have to pull through.

01:03:08.854 --> 01:03:10.245
I need you.

01:03:10.269 --> 01:03:11.718
I can't lose you too.

01:03:12.685 --> 01:03:13.997
You can do it, Dalton.

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:16.527
I know you can do it.

01:03:16.551 --> 01:03:17.966
You have to get better.

01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:19.899
Come on, Dalton.

01:03:25.284 --> 01:03:28.528
Dr. Connor, may I
please speak with you?

01:03:29.736 --> 01:03:31.635
- Yes, would you
step outside, please?

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:35.340
- Hello?

01:03:35.364 --> 01:03:36.478
- Hey, can I help you?

01:03:36.502 --> 01:03:39.619
- My name is
Detective Jim Myers,

01:03:39.643 --> 01:03:43.312
and I'm looking for a
Match-Stick, first name, Dalton.

01:03:43.336 --> 01:03:45.314
- Right down the hall, room six.

01:03:45.338 --> 01:03:46.823
- That way?
- Yeah.

01:03:54.934 --> 01:03:58.155
- Dr. Connor, what
is your prognosis?

01:03:58.179 --> 01:04:00.181
How do you think
Dalton is really doing?

01:04:01.285 --> 01:04:03.298
- Agent, it's too early
to tell right now.

01:04:03.322 --> 01:04:05.265
Based on the trauma to his body,

01:04:05.289 --> 01:04:06.609
it's about a 50/50
at this moment.

01:04:14.954 --> 01:04:17.795
- Like I said in the front
of the police station,

01:04:17.819 --> 01:04:18.993
partners until the end.

01:04:19.925 --> 01:04:21.996
Well, this is the end.

01:04:23.618 --> 01:04:25.723
- What do you think
you're doing, Jake?

01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:29.772
- Eventually my part
doesn't matter what I say,

01:04:29.796 --> 01:04:31.257
I was going do it.

01:04:31.281 --> 01:04:32.672
- Well, that makes you no
better than Match-Stick.

01:04:32.696 --> 01:04:37.159
- I know, but it makes
me feel so much better.

01:04:54.235 --> 01:04:57.835
- L90, show me code six at
2421 Pacific Coast Highway

01:04:57.859 --> 01:04:59.423
on a shooting investigation,

01:04:59.447 --> 01:05:01.459
requesting two additional units.

01:05:01.483 --> 01:05:02.899
Responding code three.

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:20.721
I got you covered!

01:05:20.745 --> 01:05:22.746
Go to the car right now!

01:05:33.653 --> 01:05:34.734
You guys okay?

01:05:34.758 --> 01:05:36.529
Anybody get injured?

01:05:36.553 --> 01:05:37.771
- I'm okay.

01:05:37.795 --> 01:05:39.290
That's one heck
of a wake up call.

01:05:39.314 --> 01:05:41.948
I guess Jake's still out to
avenge his parents' murders.

01:05:41.972 --> 01:05:44.847
- I can't believe this guy
won't let it go all this time.

01:05:44.871 --> 01:05:46.539
- Jake has gone section eight.

01:05:46.563 --> 01:05:49.266
I've never seen him so deranged.

01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:50.508
- Let me get you
guys outta here.

01:05:50.532 --> 01:05:53.063
I got a safe house for
you up in Big Bear Lake.

01:05:53.087 --> 01:05:54.202
- Sounds good, Chief.

01:05:54.226 --> 01:05:55.513
Take us there now.

01:05:55.537 --> 01:05:58.195
- Let's get the hell outta here.

01:08:15.746 --> 01:08:18.035
So how are you feeling?

01:08:18.059 --> 01:08:20.071
Tiger dumped you in the ocean.

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:21.970
You were in a coma.

01:08:21.993 --> 01:08:26.999
Have you healed spiritually,
emotionally, physically?

01:08:29.415 --> 01:08:32.703
- Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

01:08:32.728 --> 01:08:37.734
After weeks of training,
re-centering myself,

01:08:39.805 --> 01:08:44.015
building my body back
up, my mind and spirit,

01:08:45.259 --> 01:08:47.513
I think we're ready
to go back to LA,

01:08:47.537 --> 01:08:51.412
take down the Hollywood
mob, the Lunada Bay Gang,

01:08:51.437 --> 01:08:52.541
and the Triads.

01:08:54.785 --> 01:08:57.236
- So how do you wanna
accomplish this mission?

01:08:58.823 --> 01:09:03.529
- The shotgun approach,
we go in, take 'em out.

01:09:03.553 --> 01:09:05.116
It's either us or the feds.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.636
If the feds take over,
they're gonna destroy

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:10.466
all of our hard
work, Lex will walk,

01:09:10.491 --> 01:09:13.078
and Tiger will just continue
to run the syndicate.

01:09:15.081 --> 01:09:16.437
It's you and me.

01:09:16.461 --> 01:09:18.991
- Do you think
that we're enough?

01:09:19.015 --> 01:09:21.580
Don't you think we
should have some backup?

01:09:21.604 --> 01:09:23.710
- I'm a trained Navy Seal.

01:09:25.022 --> 01:09:29.786
I fought against
terrorists in Afghanistan.

01:09:31.443 --> 01:09:33.548
I fought against the
Taliban and Al-Qaeda.

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:35.688
I'm fully trained.

01:09:36.758 --> 01:09:39.772
I'm angry, I'm hungry,

01:09:39.796 --> 01:09:41.728
and I'm trained to
complete my mission.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:46.182
They will rule the day they
messed with this Navy Seal.

01:09:48.011 --> 01:09:50.300
- Okay, well, I'm gonna
trust your judgment on this

01:09:50.323 --> 01:09:52.049
when we go tomorrow
like you said.

01:09:53.258 --> 01:09:54.258
- You should.

01:09:56.053 --> 01:09:57.745
- Great.
- Great.

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.174
You look very
pretty, by the way.

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:03.785
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:11.631
- Knock, knock.

01:10:11.655 --> 01:10:15.151
- Dalton, you should be at
the bottom of the ocean, dead,

01:10:15.175 --> 01:10:16.636
locals only.

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:19.191
- I was trained not to die
and to complete my mission.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:22.332
Kiley Hall was a young,
beautiful woman who just wanted

01:10:22.356 --> 01:10:24.886
to preserve the historic surf
club her grandfather started

01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:28.130
in the 1930s, until a
trust fund piece of garbage

01:10:28.154 --> 01:10:30.374
like you took over
and corrupted it.

01:10:30.398 --> 01:10:32.031
You took her life from her.

01:10:32.055 --> 01:10:33.469
Now I'm gonna take your life.

01:10:35.921 --> 01:10:37.174
- Gonna arrest me, bro, or what?

01:10:37.198 --> 01:10:39.556
- I take it you're not
gonna come in quietly.

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:41.074
- Not a chance.

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:49.290
- I'm the ghost
of Christmas past,

01:10:49.314 --> 01:10:51.212
and your past just
caught up with you.

01:11:00.566 --> 01:11:05.226
Hey, Bolo, your days of
selling Galaxy is over.

01:11:08.746 --> 01:11:09.746
- Oh yeah?

01:11:12.647 --> 01:11:15.074
So you're the detective
who killed my father?

01:11:15.098 --> 01:11:16.558
- Yeah, that's right.

01:11:16.582 --> 01:11:19.251
You should'a heard him squeal
when I shot him in the head.

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:21.356
- Now I'm gonna
avenge his death.

01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:22.485
- Love to see you try.

01:11:52.446 --> 01:11:53.930
You're done, Tang.

01:12:05.528 --> 01:12:07.575
Hey, I know that guy.

01:12:07.599 --> 01:12:09.117
We're old friends.

01:12:10.291 --> 01:12:12.155
I'm gonna take care of
this guy real quick.

01:12:14.675 --> 01:12:16.894
Hey, Misfit, long time, no see.

01:12:16.918 --> 01:12:18.137
- You again.

01:12:18.161 --> 01:12:20.311
- Yep, I see your
face is still ugly,

01:12:20.335 --> 01:12:22.096
but your forehead
healed up nicely.

01:12:23.511 --> 01:12:24.960
- Welcome to my playground.

01:12:45.326 --> 01:12:48.985
- Now you swing with
your invisible friends.

01:12:56.371 --> 01:12:57.371
- Dalton.

01:12:59.719 --> 01:13:02.181
- KV, I see you're walking
around with a cane now.

01:13:02.205 --> 01:13:04.390
- Yeah, thanks to you
and physical therapy,

01:13:04.414 --> 01:13:05.450
I get a cane now.

01:13:06.692 --> 01:13:08.532
- You're welcome.

01:13:08.556 --> 01:13:10.258
- Well, shall we do this?

01:13:10.282 --> 01:13:11.282
- Why not?

01:13:35.134 --> 01:13:37.249
Make sure he stays down.

01:13:37.273 --> 01:13:38.344
I'm going up.

01:13:54.982 --> 01:13:57.719
- There he is.

01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:34.746
- Stay down.

01:14:38.646 --> 01:14:39.865
- What are you doing here?

01:14:39.889 --> 01:14:41.694
I thought we dumped
you in the ocean?

01:14:41.718 --> 01:14:42.524
- I'm back from the dead.

01:14:42.548 --> 01:14:44.007
Miss me?

01:14:44.031 --> 01:14:45.111
- I'll tell you what, I'm gonna
give you a fighting chance.

01:14:45.135 --> 01:14:46.135
Weapon up.

01:14:48.518 --> 01:14:49.864
- It's your a funeral, pal.

01:14:51.072 --> 01:14:52.072
This will work.

01:15:19.514 --> 01:15:21.526
I don't like your ponytail.

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:26.014
You look too much like,
I don't know, a horse.

01:15:26.038 --> 01:15:28.292
I'm gonna cut it off,
and I'm gonna slap you

01:15:28.316 --> 01:15:29.604
in your face with him.

01:15:29.628 --> 01:15:32.976
- All right, let's
see how good you are.

01:16:28.618 --> 01:16:30.240
- Come on, get him.

01:16:51.089 --> 01:16:53.204
- Time for a bedtime story.

01:16:53.228 --> 01:16:54.481
- You scumbag.

01:16:54.505 --> 01:16:57.692
- You're coming with me!
- No I'm not!

01:16:57.716 --> 01:16:59.176
- Akeem.

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:00.695
- Are you ready
for this, playboy?

01:17:00.719 --> 01:17:02.248
Is that all you got?

01:17:02.272 --> 01:17:05.585
- Yeah, I'm ready, but then
I have to go get breakfast.

01:17:06.794 --> 01:17:08.772
- Let's see what you got.

01:17:08.796 --> 01:17:09.796
Bring it.

01:17:16.493 --> 01:17:18.323
- All right, let's go.

01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:43.416
That's how you want to play?

01:17:50.735 --> 01:17:51.977
Let's end this.

01:18:06.958 --> 01:18:07.959
- Let me go.

01:18:14.172 --> 01:18:16.830
- This fight just ended, Prasad!

01:18:19.522 --> 01:18:21.455
- Come with me, Barbie.

01:18:22.282 --> 01:18:23.768
- Dalton, help me!

01:18:28.427 --> 01:18:29.888
- Careful, Dalton.

01:18:29.912 --> 01:18:31.544
You're getting way too close,
and you don't want anything

01:18:31.568 --> 01:18:33.201
to happen to her, do you?

01:18:33.225 --> 01:18:34.513
- Let her go, Tiger.

01:18:34.537 --> 01:18:36.515
It's me you want.

01:18:36.539 --> 01:18:38.413
Come on, Tiger.

01:18:38.437 --> 01:18:39.967
Get father's revenge.

01:18:39.991 --> 01:18:41.337
- Suck my balls!

01:18:44.409 --> 01:18:45.869
- Suck what?

01:18:45.893 --> 01:18:47.526
It's called a drop kicking.

01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:49.528
I learned that in second grade.

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:04.405
- Dalton, I need your help.

01:19:08.813 --> 01:19:11.377
- Dalton, snap out of it!

01:19:16.475 --> 01:19:20.410
I gotta stop freezing at
with these flashbacks.

01:19:36.702 --> 01:19:38.094
- Even if you kill me,

01:19:38.118 --> 01:19:40.475
there's more of our
family to come after you!

01:19:40.499 --> 01:19:42.684
- Yeah, and I'm
the Easter bunny.

01:19:42.708 --> 01:19:46.171
What's father's saying, try
me or die like the rest?

01:19:46.195 --> 01:19:50.865
Well, you're not with
me, so you die!

01:19:50.889 --> 01:19:52.097
Now I'm the only child.

01:20:02.038 --> 01:20:05.707
- This time, I will
avenge my parents' death.

01:20:05.731 --> 01:20:07.570
- Not on my watch.

01:20:17.053 --> 01:20:18.444
- I finish what I start too.

01:20:21.644 --> 01:20:23.415
I told them which
one of those stations

01:20:23.439 --> 01:20:25.486
that they were parked
at over the years.

01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:30.514
Manage a guess, and they was
killed by me like I wanted,

01:20:31.896 --> 01:20:34.933
but I can still avenge my
parents murder by killing you.

01:20:36.038 --> 01:20:38.454
- Oh, yeah?

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.745
If all you care about
is getting a revenge,

01:20:43.769 --> 01:20:47.187
then you're no better than my
father or his syndicate was.

01:20:48.809 --> 01:20:51.847
At least my father had
redemption in the end.

01:20:59.130 --> 01:21:01.407
- You're right, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

01:21:03.996 --> 01:21:05.136
- Let it go, Jake!

01:21:06.171 --> 01:21:07.171
Let it go.

01:21:08.346 --> 01:21:09.346
Let it die.

01:21:32.611 --> 01:21:33.992
I said let it go!

01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:51.952
Shouldn't you get in
on the passenger side?

01:21:51.976 --> 01:21:53.436
- You're cute.

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:54.460
Get in.

01:22:01.226 --> 01:22:02.651
So where do you wanna go next?

01:22:02.675 --> 01:22:04.274
Do you wanna go to the hospital?

01:22:04.298 --> 01:22:08.577
- Yeah, hospital, and then
we go on our first date.

01:22:10.373 --> 01:22:12.134
- Sounds like a plan.

01:22:17.277 --> 01:22:19.600
- You have the right
to remain silent.

01:22:19.624 --> 01:22:21.395
Anything you say can and
will be held against you

01:22:21.419 --> 01:22:22.775
in a court of law.

01:22:22.799 --> 01:22:23.880
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:22:23.904 --> 01:22:25.468
If you can't afford an attorney,

01:22:25.492 --> 01:22:27.090
one will be appointed for you.

01:22:27.114 --> 01:22:29.265
Do you understand?

01:22:32.257 --> 01:22:34.432
- Hey, pop, how you doing?

01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:38.999
- Well, I did it.

01:22:39.023 --> 01:22:41.197
I completed my mission.

01:22:44.338 --> 01:22:46.858
I took down the
Hollywood mob once again,

01:22:48.446 --> 01:22:51.690
and this time, a bunch
of surfing gang members.

01:22:53.037 --> 01:22:54.037
I did good.

01:22:57.179 --> 01:23:02.080
I just want to stop by and
pay my respects to you,

01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:04.138
tell you how much I love you,

01:23:06.291 --> 01:23:09.294
tell you how much
I think about you.

01:23:11.675 --> 01:23:12.675
I miss you.

01:23:21.962 --> 01:23:23.860
The coroner found
this in your pocket.

01:23:26.035 --> 01:23:29.210
It's your gambling chips.

01:23:30.728 --> 01:23:32.731
I see you went to
Vegas before you died,

01:23:35.079 --> 01:23:37.805
and I found some beer chips.

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:40.574
I know you liked your
Miller Light beer.

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:49.507
I thought you'd like 'em back.

01:24:04.798 --> 01:24:06.431
I love you, pop.

01:24:06.455 --> 01:24:07.455
I miss you.

01:24:21.677 --> 01:24:26.577
Pop, what are you doing here?

01:24:28.132 --> 01:24:33.137
- I came back to tell you I'm
proud of you, and I love you,

01:24:35.932 --> 01:24:37.106
and I'm doing okay.

01:24:40.144 --> 01:24:42.491
- I been waiting a
long time to hear that.

01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:45.839
You look great.

01:24:46.978 --> 01:24:49.187
Just you look just
like when I was a kid.

01:24:53.191 --> 01:24:57.057
- You're a good kid,
and you're a good man.

01:25:01.406 --> 01:25:03.660
- This is my favorite
memory of us playing,

01:25:03.684 --> 01:25:06.066
kicking the orange
soccer ball around.

01:25:09.414 --> 01:25:10.414
- Mine too.

01:25:18.216 --> 01:25:22.369
- I'm glad to see
you again, pop.

01:25:22.393 --> 01:25:23.393
I miss you.

01:25:24.602 --> 01:25:26.362
- I wanted a little
more time with you.

01:25:27.743 --> 01:25:29.434
- I'll keep making
you proud, pop.

01:25:31.471 --> 01:25:32.782
- Stay on the right track.

01:25:35.612 --> 01:25:36.924
Do it for yourself.

01:25:37.787 --> 01:25:38.787
- I love you, pop.

01:25:40.342 --> 01:25:41.342
- I love you, son.
