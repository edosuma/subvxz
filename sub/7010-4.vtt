12:44.263 --> 12:46.848
GOD, YOU'RE NOBLE.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.684
INNOCENT?
OKAY, ERIC, NO OFFENSE,

12:49.852 --> 12:53.605
BUT YOUR SISTER IS
AS SLUTTY AS THEY COME.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.274
ERIC, ARE YOU GONNA LET HER
SAY THAT ABOUT YOUR SISTER?

12:56.442 --> 12:59.736
SURE.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.030
HEY, FORMAN,
DID YOU REALIZE

13:02.198 --> 13:06.201
THAT THERE'S A ROOM
BACK HERE, MAN?

13:06.368 --> 13:09.412
AND IT BARELY STINKS!

13:09.580 --> 13:10.663
PERFECT.

13:10.831 --> 13:11.998
YOU CAN SIT BACK THERE
BENEATH YOUR BARE BULB

13:12.166 --> 13:15.210
WRITING ANGRY LETTERS
TO THE GOVERNMENT.

13:15.377 --> 13:18.254
Hyde: OH,
DON'T THINK I WON'T.

13:18.422 --> 13:19.964
YOU SEE WHAT'S BEAUTIFUL
HERE, PEOPLE?

13:20.132 --> 13:22.467
I FINALLY HAVE SOMETHING
ON LAURIE.

13:22.635 --> 13:27.764
I OWN HER. OH, YEAH,
SHE IS SO SCREWED.

13:27.932 --> 13:31.810
ALL RIGHT. JUST BE NICE.

13:34.855 --> 13:40.985
LOOK. DID EVERYONE
SEE MY HICKEY?

13:41.153 --> 13:44.531
SOMEBODY LOVES ME.

13:44.698 --> 13:47.450
MORON, YOU GAVE THAT
TO YOURSELF.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.786
IT'S STILL WET.
[LAUGHS]

13:49.954 --> 13:51.746
OH, NO, I DID NOT.

13:51.914 --> 13:57.794
SOMEBODY LOVES ME.
THERE IS A LADY LOVE.

13:57.962 --> 14:01.339
THERE IS!

14:05.761 --> 14:08.471
SO, YOU LIKE THE SHIRT
I BOUGHT YOU?

14:08.639 --> 14:12.267
[SIGHS]
IT'S VERY NICE.

14:12.434 --> 14:13.601
I WASN'T SURE,

14:13.769 --> 14:15.186
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T PUT
IT ON IN THE STORE,

14:15.354 --> 14:18.731
LIKE YOU DID
WITH THE CLOGS.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.610
[THUMPS]

14:22.778 --> 14:26.030
I KNEW IT.
YOU HATE THE SHIRT.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.658
[THUMP]

14:29.618 --> 14:31.077
NICE DIGS, HUH?

14:31.245 --> 14:32.370
IT'S PERFECT.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.788
THIS IS THE ROOM WHERE
WE PUT ALL THAT CRAP

14:33.956 --> 14:36.749
WE JUST CAN'T THROW AWAY.

14:36.917 --> 14:39.502
LIKE YOU.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.754
FORMAN, IS IT JUST ME OR DO
YOUR MOM AND DAD LIKE ME

14:41.922 --> 14:45.466
A WHOLE LOT BETTER
THAN THEY LIKE YOU?

14:45.634 --> 14:48.678
SEE, I KID, BUT YOU HURT.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.555
K¡tty: BOYS, DINNER!

14:50.723 --> 14:52.056
ALL RIGHT, MAN,

14:52.224 --> 14:53.975
YOU READY TO MAKE LAURIE
SQUEAL LIKE THE FAMILY PIG?

14:54.143 --> 14:57.937
OHH, YES.

14:58.105 --> 15:00.356
YOU'RE GONNA PUNK OUT,
AREN'T YOU?

15:00.524 --> 15:02.609
WELL, IT IS MY NATURE.

15:02.776 --> 15:06.029
LOOK, FORMAN, YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN THE RUNT OF THE LITTER.

15:06.196 --> 15:10.366
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO BITE
THE BIG DOG ON THE ASS.

15:10.534 --> 15:16.289
SO MY ADVICE TO YOU IS...
BITE THE BIG DOG ON THE ASS.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.042
OKAY, WHAT IF I LET HER OFF
WITH A WARNING, YOU KNOW?

15:19.209 --> 15:21.169
JUST THIS ONE TIME.

15:21.337 --> 15:24.297
WELL, THAT WOULD BE
THE MATURE CHOICE...

15:24.465 --> 15:26.049
BUT NOT EVIL!

15:26.216 --> 15:27.467
YOU GOTTA
THINK EVIL, MAN!

15:27.635 --> 15:30.219
WHERE WOULD WE BE
WITHOUT THE A-BOMB?

15:30.387 --> 15:32.639
WELL, ACTUALLY, THE WAR
WAS ALL BUT WON WHEN...

15:32.806 --> 15:37.560
SHUT UP! OKAY, NOW,
LET'S... LET'S REVIEW.

15:37.728 --> 15:42.941
DADDY, ERIC HAS DIRTY
MAGAZINES UNDER HIS BED.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.401
DADDY, ERIC SNUCK OUT
LAST NIGHT.

15:45.569 --> 15:49.614
DADDY, I SAW ERIC
DRINKING ALL YOUR BEER.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.116
DADDY, ERIC MADE IT HARD
FOR ME TO CONCENTRATE

15:52.284 --> 15:55.787
SO I FLUNKED OUT OF COLLEGE.

15:55.955 --> 16:01.834
DADDY, ERIC USED
ALL MY HAND LOTION.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.842
OKAY, THAT BITCH IS DEAD.

16:22.481 --> 16:25.066
SO, UM, THIS NEWS
ABOUT LAURIE LEAVING

16:25.234 --> 16:26.734
IS JUST A LITTLE
RAY OF SUNSHINE.

16:26.902 --> 16:29.404
[LAUGHS]

16:29.571 --> 16:30.822
WELL, I JUST WISH
THAT MORE TEACHERS

16:30.990 --> 16:33.032
CARED ABOUT THEIR STUDENTS
LIKE YOU DO.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.492
I THINK IT ALL STARTED
GOING DOWNHILL

16:34.660 --> 16:38.496
WHEN YOU COULDN'T
PADDLE THE KIDS ANYMORE.

16:38.664 --> 16:42.458
[LAUGHS] PANSY-ASS
SUPREME COURT.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.002
SHUT UP.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.713
HEY, FORMAN, HE WHO
HESITATES IS BONED.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.339
LAURIE IS ONE OF THE
MOST GIFTED YOUNG WOMEN

16:48.507 --> 16:50.216
IN MY CLASS.

16:50.384 --> 16:54.095
I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED
HAVING HER.

16:54.638 --> 16:57.974
[KISSING]
I OWN YOU.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.270
IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THE BREAD?

17:02.438 --> 17:05.982
NO. WHY?

17:06.984 --> 17:10.528
OH, LAURIE,
I KNOW SOMETHING

17:10.696 --> 17:14.949
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
I KNOW, YOU KNOW?

17:15.117 --> 17:17.452
YES, YES.

17:17.619 --> 17:21.748
TELL US, FORMAN,
SO THAT WE CAN ALL KNOW.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.958
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.710
AND IF YOU
DO KNOW SOMETHING,

17:25.878 --> 17:28.504
I WILL MAKE YOU SORRY
YOU WERE EVER BORN.

17:28.672 --> 17:29.839
WELL,
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

17:30.007 --> 17:31.549
I'M ALREADY SORRY
I WAS EVER BORN.

ERIC!

17:33.093 --> 17:35.511
SEE?

17:35.679 --> 17:39.474
SO, WHAT DOES SHE NEED TO DO
TO GET BACK INTO SCHOOL?

17:39.641 --> 17:43.061
WELL, SHE'LL HAVE
TO WORK WITH ME,

17:43.228 --> 17:45.563
MAKE A COMMITMENT
TO SCHOOL.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.648
SHE'LL REALLY HAVE
TO BUCKLE DOWN.

17:47.816 --> 17:50.693
[LAUGHS]
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK,
LAURIE?

17:50.861 --> 17:53.237
ARE YOU WILLING
TO GIVE IT A GO?

17:53.405 --> 17:57.658
[LAUGHS] OH, MOTHER,
SHE'S VERY WILLING.

17:58.702 --> 18:01.913
YOU KNOW, DAD, I JUST SAW THE
MOST INTERESTING THING TODAY,

18:02.081 --> 18:03.748
IN THE GARAGE.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.625
[THINKING]
BURST INTO FLAMES,
BURST INTO FLAMES!

18:05.793 --> 18:07.877
BURST INTO FLAMES!

18:08.045 --> 18:11.339
IT WAS JUST... IT WAS
SO SURPRISING.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.467
OH, ERIC, DO TELL.

18:14.635 --> 18:15.885
I SAW LAURIE...

18:16.053 --> 18:19.806
I'M IN LOVE
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE A DUCK.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.122
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:44.289 --> 18:45.665
BOTH OF YOU GUYS
REALLY NEED TO SHUT UP.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.917
I'M SO SICK OF
HEARING YOU FIGHTING.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.794
DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE FIGHTING ABOUT?

18:49.962 --> 18:52.004
UH... OH... I KNOW
SHE STARTED IT!

18:52.172 --> 18:54.507
I ONLY GOT MAD BECAUSE I
KNEW YOU WERE GONNA GET MAD.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.717
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, WHAT... YOU
KNOW WHAT? WHATEVER.

18:56.885 --> 19:02.431
JUST NO MORE FIGHTING WITH
EACH OTHER THROUGH ME. GOT IT?

19:02.599 --> 19:04.392
ALTHOUGH I WOULD LIKE YOU TO
CONTINUE BUYING ME THINGS.
