01:38.789 --> 01:41.190
that should've
been my story.

01:41.258 --> 01:43.192
you're gonna get
your story, April...

01:43.260 --> 01:44.293
now.

01:44.361 --> 01:45.461
master Splinter,

01:45.529 --> 01:46.962
we can wait
no longer.

01:47.030 --> 01:49.097
we must put
the Shredder away.

01:49.165 --> 01:51.666
i agree, Leonardo.

01:51.734 --> 01:54.401
the time has come
for the final battle

01:54.469 --> 01:56.070
with my old enemy.

01:56.138 --> 01:58.939
and April's gonna have
to tell the world about us

01:59.006 --> 02:00.740
just to keep those
lame-brained humans

02:00.808 --> 02:02.542
from trying to stop us.

02:02.609 --> 02:04.109
i'll get a news crew
together,

02:04.177 --> 02:07.046
even if i have to tie 'em up
and brand 'em.

02:12.584 --> 02:13.951
here. take this.

02:14.019 --> 02:16.587
it's a turtle
communicator,

02:16.654 --> 02:18.789
so you can find us when
you've got your crew.

02:18.856 --> 02:20.323
we all carry them now.

02:20.391 --> 02:22.291
oh, April,
take the turtle van.

02:22.359 --> 02:23.559
we'll use that vehicle

02:23.626 --> 02:25.094
the neutrinos
left behind.

02:25.162 --> 02:26.362
i'm on it.

02:37.772 --> 02:39.772
<i>greetings, turtles. </i>

02:39.840 --> 02:41.106
the Shredder !

02:41.174 --> 02:44.276
since when did he get
his own daytime talk show ?

02:44.345 --> 02:47.779
<i>observe what i have
in my hands--</i>

02:47.847 --> 02:50.716
<i>it is a retro mutagen
ray generator, </i>

02:50.783 --> 02:53.551
<i>a device which
undoes mutations. </i>

02:56.454 --> 02:59.890
<i>this is the only thing
that can restore Splinter</i>

02:59.957 --> 03:03.091
<i>to the form
of Hamato Yoshi. </i>

03:03.159 --> 03:05.995
<i>if you want it,
come get it. </i>

03:06.062 --> 03:08.330
you bet we will !

03:08.398 --> 03:11.198
i alone must get
that retro mutagen device

03:11.266 --> 03:12.767
away from the Shredder.

03:12.835 --> 03:15.668
the ray could restore me
to my human form.

03:15.736 --> 03:18.505
but what if the Shredder
used it on you ?

03:18.572 --> 03:21.107
we'd be changed back
into...

03:21.174 --> 03:24.176
ordinary turtles.

03:24.244 --> 03:26.677
bebop ! rock steady !

03:26.745 --> 03:28.579
grrr.

03:28.647 --> 03:30.682
<i>the turtles are heading
this way. </i>

03:30.749 --> 03:33.684
<i>find them
and destroy them. </i>

03:42.592 --> 03:44.093
cowabunga !

03:44.161 --> 03:45.260
ow !

03:45.327 --> 03:47.595
now we're cooking
with gas !

03:47.663 --> 03:49.163
yeah-ha-ha !

03:50.732 --> 03:51.932
oh, what now ?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.568
who bought this
piece of junk ?

03:58.439 --> 04:01.241
well, that was
a short trip.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.877
looks like
we're out of fuel.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.713
what sort of juice
does this crate take ?

04:07.780 --> 04:09.780
uh, plutonium,
i think.

04:09.849 --> 04:11.649
oh, terrific. maybe
we can get it towed

04:11.717 --> 04:13.517
to the nearest
plutonium station.

04:13.585 --> 04:16.685
so let's just hotfoot it
over to the Technodrome.

04:16.754 --> 04:18.021
are you kiddin' ?

04:18.089 --> 04:19.656
we need the weapons
on this thing.

04:19.724 --> 04:22.325
i saw something
at baxter's workshop.

04:22.392 --> 04:23.859
it'd need
a little work,

04:23.927 --> 04:25.328
but i bet
it would do the job.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.495
i'll meet you
at the Technodrome.

04:29.898 --> 04:32.232
there goes
a good turtle.

04:33.468 --> 04:34.901
well, well, well.

04:34.970 --> 04:37.536
lookie
what we found.

04:37.604 --> 04:40.106
we got
a score to settle

04:40.174 --> 04:41.841
with you little twerps.

04:47.780 --> 04:50.214
aww, did i hurt youse ?

04:50.282 --> 04:52.249
this'll make it better.

04:55.252 --> 04:58.121
we don't like rats
in our fair city.

04:59.523 --> 05:02.524
maybe i should just
ring your stinkin' neck.

05:02.592 --> 05:04.994
hyah ! not so fast,
homeboy.

05:09.898 --> 05:12.999
drink blazin'
electric death, turtles.

05:13.066 --> 05:14.968
oh, the boy
likes his work.

05:30.315 --> 05:32.116
i think they're
starting to tire.

05:32.183 --> 05:33.917
oh, great.
in a few more hours,

05:33.985 --> 05:36.253
they'll barely be able
to throw a car at us.

05:36.320 --> 05:39.789
so, like, why don't we
throw some trucks at them ?

05:44.527 --> 05:46.461
one fricasseed turtle...

05:46.529 --> 05:48.229
comin' up.

05:49.998 --> 05:53.934
ha ha ! you jerks
just got trashed.

05:54.002 --> 05:55.201
hey ! whoa !

05:59.172 --> 06:00.839
blecch !

06:00.907 --> 06:02.775
those shellheads
are dead !

06:06.011 --> 06:07.311
sorry, boys.
we gotta build

06:07.379 --> 06:08.479
a parking lot
where you're playin'.

06:16.620 --> 06:18.053
you little creeps !

06:18.121 --> 06:20.790
come back and fight !

06:25.227 --> 06:26.327
aha !

06:26.395 --> 06:27.796
there we go.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.433
Shredder,

06:33.501 --> 06:38.003
why haven't you
completed my new body ?

06:38.071 --> 06:40.440
ah, but i have.

06:46.679 --> 06:49.479
excellent.
i want you to add to it

06:49.548 --> 06:52.750
this molecular
amplification unit.

06:52.817 --> 06:54.083
but why ?

06:54.150 --> 06:56.052
Saki, you fool,

06:56.120 --> 06:57.553
don't waste time.

06:57.621 --> 07:00.856
your forces
are depleted.

07:00.924 --> 07:03.024
the turtles
are on their way.

07:03.092 --> 07:05.826
install the chip now.

07:09.230 --> 07:12.298
all right.
i'll do it.

07:22.675 --> 07:24.943
you may feel
some disorientation

07:25.010 --> 07:28.479
when you revive
in your new body.

07:43.225 --> 07:44.793
it's alive.

07:48.195 --> 07:50.564
it's alive !

08:00.372 --> 08:02.040
up we go.

08:02.108 --> 08:05.175
<i>turtle alert.
turtle alert. </i>

08:05.243 --> 08:07.244
no, it's too soon.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.279
Krang hasn't come
to his senses.

08:11.482 --> 08:14.150
foot soldiers,
stop the turtles !

08:17.120 --> 08:19.922
oh,
just what we needed.

08:19.989 --> 08:22.590
kill-crazed
foot soldier bikers.

08:42.073 --> 08:44.142
i'll try to get
the retro mutagen ray

08:44.208 --> 08:45.310
away from the Shredder.

08:45.377 --> 08:47.812
let's break some foots.

08:47.879 --> 08:49.980
go, green machine !

08:56.186 --> 08:57.986
hey, guys.
how's it going ?

08:58.054 --> 09:00.255
we're a little busy
right now, Donatello.

09:00.323 --> 09:02.124
<i>ok, i'll call back later. </i>

09:02.191 --> 09:03.358
do that.

09:03.424 --> 09:06.794
uhh ! out of
my face, jerk !

09:06.929 --> 09:09.030
hey, maybe some raw sewage
would do the trick.

09:09.097 --> 09:11.597
Leonardo, blade time.

09:11.665 --> 09:13.266
hyah !

09:17.403 --> 09:20.438
cowabunga !

09:28.012 --> 09:30.847
i'd say
the foots slipped up.

09:33.516 --> 09:34.984
so what do you say ?

09:35.052 --> 09:37.687
tonight, a little dinner,
a little dancing...

09:37.754 --> 09:38.954
i'll call you back.

09:39.021 --> 09:40.689
what are you
doing here, April ?

09:40.756 --> 09:42.958
i'm trying to get
a story for you !

09:43.025 --> 09:45.125
trying ?
4 green maniacs

09:45.193 --> 09:46.794
are running loose
in this town,

09:46.861 --> 09:49.529
and you haven't brought me
diddly-squat !

09:49.597 --> 09:51.430
they're on our side.
listen,

09:51.498 --> 09:53.332
i've been with them
for the past week.

09:53.400 --> 09:56.102
you're in cahoots
with those things ?

09:56.170 --> 09:59.138
that does it, April.
you're fired !

09:59.205 --> 10:01.039
here.
look at this.

10:01.107 --> 10:04.142
what's that,
one of their weapons ?

10:04.209 --> 10:05.777
it's, uh...

10:05.844 --> 10:09.012
it's a hyper-turtle
death ray.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.513
now, order me a news crew,

10:10.581 --> 10:13.049
or i'll turn this whole
place into a flaming rubble !

10:13.116 --> 10:14.550
of course, April.

10:14.617 --> 10:15.951
anything you say.

10:18.087 --> 10:19.621
whew !

10:19.689 --> 10:22.457
the things i have to do
to get a story.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.728
just me, mr. baxter.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.163
i'm here
to clean up.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.799
uh, you couldn't
come back

10:31.866 --> 10:32.899
a little later,
could you ?

10:32.966 --> 10:35.567
oh, i won't get
in your way, dear.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.503
my, what a mess !

10:39.305 --> 10:42.073
lady, will you
please leave ?

10:42.141 --> 10:44.408
now, i won't be
any bother to you.

10:44.475 --> 10:46.376
let me put it this way--

10:46.444 --> 10:47.678
scram !

10:47.745 --> 10:51.848
mr. baxter, you've been
working too hard.

10:51.916 --> 10:53.449
you look kinda green.

11:01.656 --> 11:03.290
what ?

11:03.358 --> 11:06.093
i'm in my new body.

11:09.830 --> 11:13.532
let's see if the molecular
reconstruction circuit works.

11:18.638 --> 11:20.338
success !

11:20.406 --> 11:23.341
i must contact
my loyal soldiers

11:23.409 --> 11:25.442
in dimension x.

11:25.510 --> 11:28.444
master Splinter's
out there alone, man.

11:28.512 --> 11:30.146
maybe we can keep
an eye on him.

11:30.214 --> 11:31.180
look !

11:34.851 --> 11:37.185
how do you work this
oversized ghetto blaster ?

11:40.322 --> 11:41.756
hey, it's that room

11:41.823 --> 11:44.057
with the gateway
to dimension x.

11:46.660 --> 11:48.395
who's that weirdo ?

11:48.463 --> 11:50.930
i don't know,
but the guy in his stomach

11:50.997 --> 11:52.332
looks like Krang.

11:52.399 --> 11:54.467
he's going to bring
his soldiers over

11:54.535 --> 11:55.800
from dimension x.

11:55.868 --> 11:58.069
that's what he thinks.
come on !

11:59.839 --> 12:01.038
vern just called

12:01.106 --> 12:02.673
rescinding this
order of yours.

12:02.741 --> 12:04.942
he doesn't know
what the turtles are about.

12:05.009 --> 12:07.777
they're trying to save us
from an alien invasion.

12:07.845 --> 12:10.013
if you only had
some proof.

12:12.882 --> 12:14.382
here, look.

12:14.450 --> 12:16.051
that's good
enough for me.

12:16.119 --> 12:17.219
stop them !

12:17.287 --> 12:18.886
let's go !

12:20.756 --> 12:22.589
gun it, April.

12:24.291 --> 12:25.424
oh, nuts !

12:35.001 --> 12:37.334
so you've come
at last,

12:37.402 --> 12:38.703
Hamato Yoshi.

12:38.771 --> 12:40.005
here i am.

12:40.072 --> 12:41.439
but am i here...

12:41.507 --> 12:43.474
or here ?
ha ha ha ha ha !

12:43.608 --> 12:45.442
i could be anywhere--

12:45.509 --> 12:47.510
even right behind you.

12:53.584 --> 12:55.183
a lucky shot, old man.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.685
but if you want
the retro mutagen ray,

12:57.754 --> 13:00.187
you must first
face my blades.

13:00.255 --> 13:02.857
and i will beat you,

13:02.924 --> 13:06.492
as i did
when i was human.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.295
this is lord Krang

13:08.362 --> 13:11.298
calling general traag
in dimension x.

13:11.365 --> 13:13.098
are you there ?

13:13.166 --> 13:15.467
i am here, my lord.

13:15.535 --> 13:17.936
12 brigades
stand ready, lord,

13:18.003 --> 13:20.238
with more to come.

13:20.306 --> 13:24.107
excellent. stand by
while i'll open the portal.

13:24.175 --> 13:27.277
then lead my men
into this world

13:27.345 --> 13:29.312
to conquer it.

13:29.379 --> 13:31.547
not so fast, baldy.

13:31.615 --> 13:33.682
you're gonna have
to conquer us first.

13:33.749 --> 13:36.851
that should be
fairly easy.

13:36.919 --> 13:40.955
the molecular amplification
circuit works.

13:49.963 --> 13:53.231
this guy's gettin' too
big for his britches.

13:53.298 --> 13:56.133
now, wretched reptiles,

13:56.201 --> 13:59.570
you will face
the wrath of Krang !

13:59.637 --> 14:01.638
wasn't that the name
of a movie ?

14:01.707 --> 14:03.908
i don't believe
i saw it.

14:03.975 --> 14:06.910
and i don't believe
i'm seeing this.

14:14.484 --> 14:16.518
holy guacamole !

14:16.585 --> 14:20.621
nothing can stop
the almighty Krang.

14:39.538 --> 14:43.106
now, let's just hope
it works.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.645
and away we go !

14:50.480 --> 14:52.848
where's godzilla when
you really need him ?

15:00.154 --> 15:02.756
you pathetic old rat !

15:02.824 --> 15:05.191
why don't you stand
your ground and fight ?

15:05.258 --> 15:07.427
you have forgotten
the lessons

15:07.494 --> 15:08.428
i taught you, Saki.

15:10.096 --> 15:11.930
you can never win.

15:11.997 --> 15:15.832
gentle always
turns away strong.

15:15.900 --> 15:17.801
you wretched rodent !

15:17.869 --> 15:21.105
well, guys, it's been
great knowing you.

15:21.172 --> 15:22.872
huh ?

15:22.940 --> 15:24.608
what the heck ?

15:24.675 --> 15:26.175
come on, guys !

15:28.678 --> 15:30.946
welcome aboard
the turtle blimp.

15:31.014 --> 15:33.282
does this thing
actually work ?

15:33.349 --> 15:34.582
just watch.

15:34.650 --> 15:38.085
cowabunga !

15:38.153 --> 15:41.087
this still ain't gonna stop
that king-sized creep.

15:41.155 --> 15:42.723
we've gotta
shrink him down.

15:42.790 --> 15:44.290
oh, i know !

15:44.359 --> 15:46.559
let's wash him
in hot water.

15:46.626 --> 15:50.063
something in that body's
expanding his molecules.

15:50.130 --> 15:51.963
we've gotta put it
out of commission.

15:53.966 --> 15:55.599
take the controls.

15:55.667 --> 15:57.300
wh-wh-what controls ?!

16:02.140 --> 16:04.674
what the heck's that ?

16:04.742 --> 16:06.976
his brain's
in his stomach.

16:07.043 --> 16:09.377
wait till vern gets
an eyeful of this.

16:09.445 --> 16:12.180
wait till the world
gets an eyeful of this.

16:13.783 --> 16:16.951
Raphael, can't you
drive this thing ?

16:17.018 --> 16:18.052
no !

16:18.119 --> 16:19.554
i can't either !

16:19.621 --> 16:20.953
yeah, i guessed that.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.723
we'll just
have to improvise.

16:26.293 --> 16:29.027
i'm getting some heavy,
heavy energy readings

16:29.095 --> 16:30.128
from over there.

16:31.564 --> 16:32.530
hey, ha ha !

16:32.597 --> 16:34.098
i'm starting to get
the hang of this.

16:34.166 --> 16:37.468
now let's eradicate
that creep, man.

16:37.536 --> 16:39.770
oops, we must be
in the shoulder joint.

16:39.837 --> 16:41.538
let's just hope
Krang doesn't make

16:41.606 --> 16:42.506
any sudden moves.

16:45.843 --> 16:47.342
aah !
aah !

16:49.178 --> 16:50.545
there it is.

16:51.847 --> 16:53.381
let's cut it out
of there.

16:55.418 --> 16:57.350
you have corrupted
my teaching.

16:57.419 --> 16:58.685
you have brought
dishonor

16:58.753 --> 17:00.787
upon the noble
foot clan.

17:00.922 --> 17:04.290
now you will pay
for your crimes.

17:07.428 --> 17:08.859
now, turtles,

17:08.928 --> 17:10.529
you're finished.

17:14.098 --> 17:15.900
this is taking
too long.

17:15.968 --> 17:20.236
we've got to shrink
this guy down... now.

17:21.704 --> 17:25.707
no-o-o-o-o !

17:25.775 --> 17:27.709
we gotta
get out of here !

17:27.777 --> 17:29.144
we'll be crushed.

17:34.449 --> 17:35.816
excuse us.

17:45.125 --> 17:48.027
i am Krang
the all-powerful.

17:48.094 --> 17:51.662
i have never been
defeated.

17:51.730 --> 17:54.865
well, you never tangled
with a turtle before, pal.

17:54.933 --> 17:57.167
all: let's kick some shell !

18:00.105 --> 18:02.405
Shredder, come quickly.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.674
<i>i need you. </i>

18:04.741 --> 18:07.342
so sorry
to bring our game

18:07.410 --> 18:09.577
to an early
conclusion.

18:12.748 --> 18:15.349
you wouldn't
have won anyway.

18:15.417 --> 18:17.284
the retro mutagen ray--

18:17.352 --> 18:19.619
he's going to use it
on the turtles.

18:39.303 --> 18:43.572
uh-oh. it's that retro
muto thingamabob.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.574
he's gonna use it
to turn us back

18:45.642 --> 18:47.409
into ordinary turtles.

18:47.477 --> 18:49.544
well, gang,
looks like it's back

18:49.611 --> 18:51.579
to the old pet shop
for us.

18:51.647 --> 18:54.381
far from it.
tonight,

18:54.448 --> 18:56.450
i dine on
turtle soup.

19:00.520 --> 19:02.588
no !

19:02.656 --> 19:04.123
master Splinter.

19:04.191 --> 19:06.892
climb on my back.

19:09.595 --> 19:12.530
mastery, that device
was your only hope

19:12.597 --> 19:14.598
of being human again.

19:14.666 --> 19:17.900
i had to destroy it
to save you.

19:17.968 --> 19:20.437
what happened to Krang
and the shredhead ?

19:20.504 --> 19:21.905
how much you wanna bet
they're gonna try

19:21.973 --> 19:24.106
to open that
dimensional portal ?

19:24.174 --> 19:25.073
come on.

19:25.141 --> 19:26.642
listen, if you can
get the Shredder

19:26.709 --> 19:28.410
away from that portal,

19:28.478 --> 19:31.846
i think i can shut his
operation down for keeps.

19:31.914 --> 19:35.416
general traag,
it is time.

19:36.850 --> 19:39.585
we are coming,
my lord Krang.

19:39.653 --> 19:42.487
not so fast,
chrome breath.

19:45.658 --> 19:48.426
stop those turtles.

19:48.493 --> 19:49.727
snap it up, Donatello.

19:51.363 --> 19:52.731
that's it.
let's beat it.

19:57.635 --> 20:00.936
the portal mechanism
has been reversed.

20:01.004 --> 20:02.572
what's going on ?

20:08.645 --> 20:10.679
how did you do that,
Donatello ?

20:10.747 --> 20:12.379
i reversed the flow
of the portal.

20:12.447 --> 20:14.615
it pulled itself
into dimension x.

20:14.683 --> 20:17.717
rock, dudes !
we did it !

20:17.785 --> 20:19.285
we won !

20:19.353 --> 20:23.522
yes, but master Splinter
may never be human now.

20:23.589 --> 20:26.525
ah, well,
perhaps it is my karma

20:26.592 --> 20:28.761
to live my life
as a rat.

20:28.827 --> 20:31.896
the important thing
is that you are safe

20:31.964 --> 20:33.765
and we are together.

20:33.832 --> 20:35.565
i second that emotion.

20:35.633 --> 20:37.067
what the devil
happened ?

20:37.135 --> 20:39.602
where the devil
are we ?

20:39.671 --> 20:41.704
dimension x ?

20:41.772 --> 20:43.205
no !

20:43.273 --> 20:48.342
at last, i can conquer
my home dimension.

20:48.410 --> 20:51.412
but i don't want
to conquer this place.

20:51.480 --> 20:54.181
i want to conquer earth.

20:54.248 --> 20:55.716
in dimension x,

20:55.784 --> 20:58.218
i am absolute master.

20:58.286 --> 21:02.188
you will do my bidding
from now on.

21:02.255 --> 21:05.023
the Shredder takes
orders from no one !

21:05.091 --> 21:09.394
we shall see,
Oroku Saki.

21:09.461 --> 21:12.696
<i>the turtles turned out
to be the saviors of the city</i>

21:12.764 --> 21:15.065
<i>as they fought off
an alien invasion. </i>

21:15.133 --> 21:18.234
<i>opinion about them remains
sharply divided, however. </i>

21:18.302 --> 21:21.037
<i>turtles are smelly
and disgusting. </i>

21:21.104 --> 21:23.204
<i>i say hang
all four of them. </i>

21:23.272 --> 21:25.607
<i>they're, like,
totally rad, man. </i>

21:25.675 --> 21:27.942
<i>yeah, i want
to be a turtle</i>

21:28.009 --> 21:29.243
<i>when i grow up. </i>

21:29.311 --> 21:31.111
<i>but who are they ?</i>

21:31.179 --> 21:32.713
<i>where did they come from ?</i>

21:32.781 --> 21:35.081
<i>it's a complete mystery, </i>

21:35.148 --> 21:37.316
<i>but i'll continue
to update the exploits</i>

21:37.385 --> 21:40.118
<i>of these teenage
mutant ninja turtles. </i>

21:40.186 --> 21:42.588
<i>April O'Neil,
happy hour news. </i>

21:42.655 --> 21:44.590
all right !
now we can relax,

21:44.657 --> 21:45.757
catch some
boob tube,

21:45.824 --> 21:47.325
and forget about
all that weirdness

21:47.392 --> 21:48.592
we just
went through.

21:48.660 --> 21:51.429
for now. but i fear
we have not seen

21:51.496 --> 21:54.431
the last of the Shredder
or Krang.

21:54.498 --> 21:56.700
you're worrying
too much, master.

21:56.767 --> 21:59.035
yeah, i bet we'll never
even hear

21:59.102 --> 22:01.704
so much as
a peep out of them again.

22:01.771 --> 22:03.206
<i>tv: stay tuned

22:03.273 --> 22:05.207
