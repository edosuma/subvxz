WEBVTT

00:32.907 --> 00:35.368
Oh, another Thanksgiving

00:35.452 --> 00:38.329
with Hank Hill's famous smoked turkey.

00:38.413 --> 00:41.166
Mmm. What can I bring this year, Hank?

00:41.166 --> 00:42.709
Straws?

00:42.709 --> 00:45.462
Uh, well, Bill, we're, uh...

00:45.462 --> 00:47.505
And by "we," I mean me,

00:47.589 --> 00:49.799
my family and this turkey,

00:49.883 --> 00:52.343
we're all going to Montana
for Thanksgiving.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.095
- Oh.
- Yeah.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.639
See, Peggy and her mom
don't always get along,

00:56.723 --> 00:58.058
and now Mother Platter's

00:58.058 --> 01:00.351
starting to take it out on propane.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.228
She says it can't get the job done

01:02.312 --> 01:04.022
when it comes to smoking turkey.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.648
Well, I'm not going to let that go.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.610
So for Peggy's sake,
I got to prove her mom wrong.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.738
Now, uh, this doesn't leave the alley,

01:11.738 --> 01:14.616
but, uh, Peggy's parents wanted to take us

01:14.616 --> 01:16.785
to a restaurant for Thanksgiving.

01:17.827 --> 01:18.828
- Mm.
- Mm.

01:18.912 --> 01:19.746
But don't worry.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.165
I convinced them
to have the meal at their house,

01:22.165 --> 01:24.459
and I'm going with my standard plan.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.461
Cowboys game, dinner at 5:00,

01:26.461 --> 01:28.671
and serve dessert in time for <i>Home Alone.</i>

01:29.881 --> 01:33.259
They broke into the wrong kid's house.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.179
Hey, man, you got me thinking
about dang old Mama Boomhauer, man.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.348
I think I'll fly out to Miami Beach, man.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.391
Talk about a blind date
with the neighbor's, man,

01:40.475 --> 01:42.477
great-great-great-great
granddaughter, man.

01:42.477 --> 01:43.394
She's 40.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.021
So you're leaving, too?

01:45.105 --> 01:47.482
I hate Thanksgiving!

01:52.070 --> 01:53.905
Let's go, Bobby. It's almost 10:00.

01:53.905 --> 01:55.115
With the Dallas traffic,

01:55.115 --> 01:56.741
we won't get to the airport till noon,

01:56.825 --> 01:59.369
and that flight leaves at 4:00
with or without us.

01:59.369 --> 02:02.497
The turkey smells good.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.583
Can I hold it on my lap
to sniff for the ride?

02:05.667 --> 02:08.002
The turkey rides up front with me,

02:08.086 --> 02:09.712
away from the rear defroster.

02:09.796 --> 02:11.089
I just talked to your grandma,

02:11.089 --> 02:12.173
and I went out on a limb

02:12.257 --> 02:14.926
and promised moistness and smokiness.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.136
My mother called?

02:16.136 --> 02:18.138
Oh, I wanted to tell her

02:18.138 --> 02:20.014
that I'm going to bake my Brown Betty.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.809
Yeah. Uh, she said not to bother.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.686
She'll just pick up some Sara Lee.

02:24.686 --> 02:25.937
Oh, sure.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.772
But if my brother were making Brown Betty,

02:27.856 --> 02:29.315
she'd freaking lick the bowl.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.651
What a coincidence, Hank.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.945
I have to go
to the Dallas-Fort Worth airport

02:33.945 --> 02:37.615
to pick up my Uncle
who's coming in for Thanksgiving.

02:37.699 --> 02:38.700
What time's his flight?

02:38.700 --> 02:40.368
What time's your flight?

02:40.368 --> 02:42.370
- Four o'clock.
- Four o'clock. Mm-hm.

02:42.370 --> 02:44.289
I can drive you to the airport.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.166
Okay, I guess that'll save me some time.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.125
Which uncle is it?

02:48.376 --> 02:49.419
Bill.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.421
Huh. So you're named after him?

02:53.047 --> 02:54.424
I said Stan.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.720
Okay, Uncle Hank, I'm all ready.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.805
My first time seeing Daddy

03:00.889 --> 03:03.391
since Mama second-degree
assaulted him with a fork.

03:03.391 --> 03:06.477
Oh! This is so exciting!

03:06.561 --> 03:07.562
Boy, it sure is.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.981
Now, I like to keep
all our airline tickets

03:09.981 --> 03:11.399
in the travel caddy.

03:11.399 --> 03:12.817
Luanne, if you don't mind...

03:12.901 --> 03:13.860
Huh?

03:13.860 --> 03:16.613
Oh, Hank, could I please talk
to you for a minute?

03:18.907 --> 03:21.075
Well, Luanne does not have a ticket.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.661
You were supposed to buy tickets
for the family.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.038
That's right. I bought tickets

03:25.038 --> 03:27.415
for all three members of the Hill family.

03:27.415 --> 03:30.084
Hank Hill, Peggy Hill, and Bobby Hill.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.127
The Hills.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.254
What is the matter with you?

03:33.338 --> 03:35.465
As far as Luanne knows, you love her,

03:35.465 --> 03:37.467
and you consider her part of this family.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.803
Do not let her know that
you neglected to buy her a ticket.

03:40.887 --> 03:44.557
Well, I think she's going to find out
when we leave her here.

03:44.641 --> 03:48.269
No, sir. You will buy Luanne a ticket
at the airport,

03:48.353 --> 03:50.021
and it is not going to be easy

03:50.021 --> 03:53.233
because the day before Thanksgiving is,
in my opinion,

03:53.233 --> 03:55.902
one of the busiest
travel days of the year.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.246
Okay, Bill, that zone's

04:06.246 --> 04:08.206
for loading and unloading only.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.666
We can take it from here.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.502
Well, then, it's off to Uncle Stu.

04:13.127 --> 04:14.254
You said Stan.

04:14.879 --> 04:17.340
Okay, Hank, you win.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.968
"Stan" it is.

04:21.803 --> 04:22.971
Did you pack your own bags

04:22.971 --> 04:24.639
and have they been
in your sight at all times?

04:24.639 --> 04:26.766
Well, I had to set them on the curb

04:26.766 --> 04:28.810
when I unloaded them from the trunk.

04:28.810 --> 04:29.978
But they were in your sight?

04:30.645 --> 04:32.397
No, I had my back turned.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.148
But just for a moment?

04:34.232 --> 04:37.443
Well, I'd say it was more
like a minute than a moment.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.862
Oh, for God's sake.
Just say they were in your sight, Hank.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.281
Peggy, the man is an official

04:41.281 --> 04:43.783
of the United States airlines.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.410
I'd be committing perjury.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.374
- It's clean.
- So, just the two bags then?

04:51.374 --> 04:53.876
Yep. And this tank of propane.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.128
Oh, man!

04:55.128 --> 04:58.756
Oh, don't worry.
That was in my sight the entire time.

05:01.509 --> 05:04.512
They let that woman
bring an oxygen tank on the plane.

05:08.057 --> 05:11.769
Ooh! I get to use my Junior College ID.

05:12.186 --> 05:13.855
That's me in the picture.

05:13.855 --> 05:17.442
I got the giggles
'cause there were these four girls and...

05:21.279 --> 05:23.323
Well, now we've all got the giggles.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.200
You better sit down. Over there, yeah.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.286
Any seats left to Billings?

05:28.286 --> 05:30.788
Yes, sir. That'll be 719 dollars.

05:30.872 --> 05:34.125
What? I paid 250 dollars for my ticket.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.877
That's the price I want!

05:35.877 --> 05:38.087
Sir, you bought your ticket
six months ago.

05:38.171 --> 05:41.007
You are buying Miss Platter's ticket
on the day of travel.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.425
All right, listen.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.761
Miss Platter is traveling to Montana

05:44.761 --> 05:46.846
to see her father for Thanksgiving.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.473
She hasn't seen him in years.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.850
Doesn't that mean anything
to your airline?

05:53.436 --> 05:55.438
I'm going to write a personal check,

05:55.438 --> 05:58.775
and in the memo line,
I am writing "unfair."

06:03.279 --> 06:06.366
How long are you going to be
in Arizona, Mr. Red Corn?

06:06.366 --> 06:08.201
Just for the Thanksgiving weekend.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.120
Hey, do your people
even celebrate Thanksgiving?

06:11.704 --> 06:12.705
We did.

06:12.789 --> 06:13.706
Once.

06:19.128 --> 06:22.048
Um, Shug, maybe I should see
John Red Corn to the gate.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.549
Make sure he gets off all right.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.051
Good idea, sweetheart.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.637
Joseph and I will go find a broken meter

06:27.637 --> 06:29.138
to park the bug-a-bago.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.767
Uncle Hank, a man just asked me

06:32.767 --> 06:35.520
if I wanted to join the mile-high club.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.147
Could you get me an application?

06:38.231 --> 06:39.857
Well, I would think they would have them

06:39.941 --> 06:41.150
on the plane, Luanne.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.610
Hey, Hank!

06:42.610 --> 06:45.113
Look, Minh, it's the early birds.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.950
Hey, Hank, our flight same time as yours.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.952
I saw you leave house at 10:00 am.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.245
We leave five hours later.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.288
You still waiting, you dumb redneck.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.707
Yeah, okay. Happy Thanksgiving.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.626
Oh, yeah. You, too.

07:00.378 --> 07:03.548
Okay, Mother Platter,
well, we're all set to board here,

07:03.548 --> 07:06.300
so, uh, hope you're ready
to eat some smoked turkey

07:06.384 --> 07:08.386
with humble pie for dessert.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.096
Uh...

07:10.096 --> 07:12.974
No. Peggy's still planning
to make a Brown Betty.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.268
Yeah, yeah, I was just, uh...

07:15.810 --> 07:16.853
Never mind.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.815
Good afternoon,
passengers traveling to Billings.

07:20.815 --> 07:23.151
We regret to inform you
that the bad weather has forced

07:23.151 --> 07:24.569
the delay of your flight.

07:24.569 --> 07:27.321
- What?
- But my daddy's on a day pass.

07:27.405 --> 07:29.282
Excuse me, sir. Hank Hill.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.576
I would like to volunteer my services

07:31.576 --> 07:34.787
in any way necessary
to help get this plane off the ground.

07:34.871 --> 07:35.997
So, put me to work.

07:35.997 --> 07:39.000
Sir, crowding me
will not get you out any faster.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.084
It's sleeting out there,

07:40.168 --> 07:42.003
and the runways are like skating rinks.

07:47.216 --> 07:48.301
Oh.

07:50.470 --> 07:55.224
Oh, Uncle Hank,
they can't delay Thanksgiving, can they?

07:55.308 --> 07:56.601
They just did.

08:04.692 --> 08:07.028
No, Mother Platter,
I'm not calling from the plane.

08:07.028 --> 08:09.447
Those phones are only for emergencies.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.282
We just have a small delay.

08:11.282 --> 08:12.700
Hank, I want to make sure my mom

08:12.700 --> 08:14.660
has all the ingredients
for my Brown Betty,

08:14.744 --> 08:17.580
which I have made every year from 1976

08:17.580 --> 08:19.790
until I die, inclusive.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.752
I will need margarine and not butter.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.378
- Is that Peggy?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

08:24.462 --> 08:26.380
Tell her we use butter in this house.

08:26.464 --> 08:27.548
<i>Uh, okay.</i>

08:30.343 --> 08:31.719
She got butter, didn't she?

08:39.310 --> 08:41.479
<i>You said it, Bing.</i>

08:41.479 --> 08:44.524
<i>The weather outside is frightful.</i>

08:44.524 --> 08:47.318
<i>If you're flying out of DFW, bad news.</i>

08:47.318 --> 08:48.986
<i>All flights are delayed.</i>

08:52.073 --> 08:53.157
Why in the world...

08:53.241 --> 08:54.617
This is ridiculous!

08:55.785 --> 08:57.995
They should let the man do his job.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.331
Dad, I know you said to try,

09:00.331 --> 09:02.375
but I can't eat this.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.501
It's salad.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.753
Hank, the boy needs protein
or he'll pass out.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.296
Now, break open that box.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.590
Thanksgiving will go on
with a one-legged turkey.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.300
"One-legged turkey"?

09:11.384 --> 09:13.970
I'm not even going
to dignify that with a response,

09:14.428 --> 09:16.639
other than "shame on you."

09:16.639 --> 09:18.891
- Hey, Bobby.

09:18.975 --> 09:23.062
Ooh, Connie, how'd you get
that teriyaki beef bowl so fast?

09:23.062 --> 09:24.188
My dad.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.025
Here you go, ma'am.

09:28.776 --> 09:31.988
I'm district manager, pitching in.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.740
Crazy day, huh?

09:34.824 --> 09:35.950
Go to the front of the line.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.202
Mr. Souphanousinphone
will give you some food.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.079
Hold up, Bobby. That ain't right.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.122
We're not animals.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.082
We'll wait in line like everybody else.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.835
Hank, the ability to cut ahead in line

09:45.835 --> 09:48.462
is what separates us from the animals.

09:48.546 --> 09:51.299
Okay, people, personal insults
and criticisms directed toward me

09:51.299 --> 09:53.384
will not get your plane out any faster.

09:53.384 --> 09:54.802
In just a few minutes, we will begin...

09:54.802 --> 09:55.886
You're an ass.

09:55.970 --> 09:59.056
We will begin
deicing your plane for takeoff.

09:59.682 --> 10:00.850
Thank you, sir.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.894
Ruth Ann, I was just in the bathroom
next to the pilot.

10:03.978 --> 10:06.606
He told me they don't have
enough workers to deice their planes,

10:06.606 --> 10:09.358
but TWA does,
and they're honoring all tickets.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.819
<i>Una momento, señor. Yo hablo español.</i>

10:11.819 --> 10:15.072
Yes, do you know
where I can catch the TWA flight?

10:15.156 --> 10:17.158
I think it's gate <i>cincuenta y ocho.</i>

10:19.827 --> 10:21.037
58.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.456
Come on, Hank. You heard the man.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.417
We have to go
to gate <i>cincuenta y ocho. Andele.</i>

10:26.417 --> 10:28.669
That was nothing but third-hand gossip.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.129
You're acting like you're drunk.

10:32.548 --> 10:33.924
Look, Bobby.

10:34.008 --> 10:36.260
Chock full of chips
just opened a second register.

10:36.344 --> 10:39.597
- Oh, God!
- Hank, Hank! Bobby got away!

10:39.597 --> 10:41.474
- What?
- Get him! Go get him!

10:42.767 --> 10:44.518
Bobby, get... What are you...

10:48.397 --> 10:50.191
- What's the matter what you?

10:52.360 --> 10:53.444
Cookies.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.154
Hank, did you hear that announcement?

10:55.154 --> 10:56.697
The gate agent just said

10:56.781 --> 10:59.158
were supposed to go to the TWA flight.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.201
What?

11:00.201 --> 11:02.953
- All right, let me go ask him and...
- No! There is no time.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.039
The plane leaves in ten minutes.

11:05.039 --> 11:09.001
Joseph, here's a roll
of quarter-sized aluminum slugs.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.629
Go knock yourself out at the video arcade.

11:17.468 --> 11:21.472
Shackleford. Admiral Rusty Shackleford.

11:21.472 --> 11:22.932
I'll keep my coat.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.935
Admiral.

11:26.268 --> 11:27.436
Lady Admiral.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.146
Admiral.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.781
I'm sorry, Admiral.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.158
There's no smoking
in the terminal building.

11:43.452 --> 11:46.872
You're not sorry, and I'm not an admiral.

11:51.877 --> 11:55.005
For the third time, sir,
we don't even fly to Montana.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.841
Well, you check it again!

11:56.841 --> 11:59.802
My wife heard an official announcement.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.053
Tell her, Peggy.

12:02.596 --> 12:03.639
All right, Peggy,

12:03.723 --> 12:05.599
you lied to me about the announcement.

12:05.683 --> 12:06.851
That's strike one.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.937
What? Oh, don't start
with that baseball...

12:09.937 --> 12:11.021
That's two.

12:12.022 --> 12:14.024
What happens when he gets to three?

12:14.108 --> 12:15.109
He doesn't know.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.279
Where's everybody going?
Did we miss the flight?

12:18.279 --> 12:20.030
No. It's been canceled
till tomorrow morning.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.450
Canceled? Now, you listen to me.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.535
I know my rights as a passenger.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.370
- And you...
- Attention, remaining passengers.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.831
We are holding a block of rooms
at the EconoSuites.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.875
A shuttle van is waiting
to take you there.

12:33.127 --> 12:36.505
Nope, uh-uh. There are too many people
and not enough seats.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.423
Do the math, Hank.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.384
Well, if this van fills up,
they'll send a second one.

12:40.468 --> 12:43.512
Hank Rutherford Hill,
is "naive" your middle name?

12:43.596 --> 12:45.097
There is no second van,

12:45.181 --> 12:47.641
And there will never be
enough rooms at the hotel.

12:47.725 --> 12:48.893
Hey, yo, man, Hank.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.811
Man, looks like a damn layover, man.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.898
Gonna be something that wind up something
special on the ground, man.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.149
You know what I'm saying, man?

12:55.149 --> 12:57.651
The hotel vans are over here.
Where's he going?

12:57.735 --> 12:59.820
Hank, we are fighting a war here

12:59.904 --> 13:02.198
called Thanksgiving at the airport.

13:02.198 --> 13:05.951
Now, we can either stand here
and take it like the French,

13:06.035 --> 13:08.704
or we can beat the rest
of these chumps to the hotel.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.663
Now, come on!

13:09.747 --> 13:12.291
Hank! Peggy!

13:14.460 --> 13:15.961
Hey, did you hear?

13:16.378 --> 13:18.297
The whole airport's shut down.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.883
We're stuck here all night.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.051
Bill, get the car.

13:23.052 --> 13:26.514
Mr. Dauterive, did your uncle's flight
get in okay?

13:26.514 --> 13:27.848
Oh, yeah, sure.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.642
So, can we meet him?

13:29.642 --> 13:31.685
No, he's back in Arlen.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.187
Then why are you here?

13:33.854 --> 13:34.980
We had a fight.

13:35.689 --> 13:36.690
He bit me.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.192
Bill, I still don't understand

13:38.192 --> 13:40.194
why you're actually here.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.737
Do you want a ride or not?

13:41.821 --> 13:43.739
Bill, keep your eyes on the road.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.074
Oh, don't worry, Peggy.

13:57.378 --> 14:00.005
- Strike two and a half!

14:17.273 --> 14:19.108
- Get the hell out of there!

14:19.108 --> 14:20.818
There's no smoking in the airport.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.366
Well, that was a wonderful
waste of time.

14:40.170 --> 14:43.632
Admiral in distress!

14:45.092 --> 14:47.970
Now, we want to be
on the first flight tomorrow morning.

14:48.596 --> 14:52.725
So, I'm going to set
my watch alarm for 5:30.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.269
<i>Paging passenger Tom Ganaway.</i>

14:55.269 --> 14:58.063
<i>Please pick up the nearest
white courtesy phone.</i>

14:58.147 --> 15:01.317
Peggy. Peggy, I think that's Tom Ganaway.

15:02.484 --> 15:04.695
All right. Good night, everybody.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.456
<i>Good morning
and Happy Thanksgiving to you all.</i>

15:15.456 --> 15:18.292
<i>I'm pleased to announce that
flight 211 to Billings is now boarding.</i>

15:18.292 --> 15:19.793
<i>We know it's been a difficult night,</i>

15:19.877 --> 15:21.420
<i>but in appreciation of your patience,</i>

15:21.420 --> 15:22.838
<i>your headsets will be free.</i>

15:23.714 --> 15:25.966
Miss Platter,
we've oversold the Coach section.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.636
Since you're traveling
on a full-fare Coach ticket,

15:28.636 --> 15:30.471
we're going to bump you up to First-Class.

15:31.639 --> 15:32.765
Good morning, Hills.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.975
Yes, I use Gold Club miles

15:35.059 --> 15:36.936
to upgrade to honeymoon suite.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.146
Best rest of my life.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.900
Yeah, well, I was too excited to sleep,
I tell you what!

15:42.900 --> 15:45.527
I'm going to visit my in-laws!

15:46.570 --> 15:48.572
I'm sorry, sir,
you're going to have to check that.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.407
This isn't fair.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.409
It meets the cubic feet requirement.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.827
It's just oddly shaped.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.955
Oh, for God's sake, Hank, there's no time.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.039
Just check it.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.875
<i>Please hurry up and take your seats.</i>

15:59.959 --> 16:02.378
<i>We only have a small break
in the weather to take off.</i>

16:03.462 --> 16:05.130
Well, they're still loading the luggage.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.465
Looks like a good crew.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.385
Boy, that big gal can really toss a bag.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.469
Look at her.

16:11.553 --> 16:15.391
Um, that curtain over there,
what's it for?

16:15.391 --> 16:17.810
It separates First-Class from Coach.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.645
I'd like that closed.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.230
Hey, there's my turkey box.

16:23.065 --> 16:26.568
Yeah, those dogs sure know a good
smoked turkey when they smell it.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.743
Hey, they're not going to forget
my turkey, are they?

16:34.827 --> 16:36.537
Peggy, get the stewardess.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.747
Oh, no, forget it. Here comes somebody.

16:39.623 --> 16:40.874
What?

16:40.958 --> 16:42.668
What in the heck is he doing?

16:42.668 --> 16:45.129
My God, Hank, that's the bomb squad.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.213
There's a bomb?

16:46.213 --> 16:48.841
No, no, it's not a bomb, it's a turkey.

16:49.466 --> 16:51.927
It's a smoked turkey, you idiot!

16:52.011 --> 16:53.178
Get away from there!

16:53.262 --> 16:56.140
Stop that! Hey. You... you there!

16:56.140 --> 16:58.767
Oh, please, God, no!

17:10.821 --> 17:13.115
<i>I'm sorry,
but the bad weather has moved back in</i>

17:13.115 --> 17:15.367
<i>and we've lost our window for takeoff.</i>

17:15.451 --> 17:17.286
You blew up the wrong man's turkey.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.079
Now get me to Montana!

17:19.163 --> 17:22.458
I've got ten hours
to buy and smoke a bird.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.669
Well, DFW is completely shut down.

17:26.378 --> 17:29.089
Ah, but Love Field is getting flights out,

17:29.173 --> 17:30.841
and there's one to Montana
that leaves in an hour.

17:30.841 --> 17:33.093
Love Field is clear across town.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.054
The airport bus
is leaving in five minutes.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.430
It's your only chance.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.270
Did you hear something? What did he say?

17:43.270 --> 17:45.355
Uh, nothing.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.858
Looks like we're going to be here a while.

17:47.858 --> 17:50.527
Dang airlines, you know.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.612
Yeah.

17:56.492 --> 17:59.244
Get your bags, start walking.
Bobby, Luanne, follow me.

18:03.665 --> 18:04.917
Hank, where are we going?

18:04.917 --> 18:06.335
- What's the...
- Just walk.

18:06.335 --> 18:09.755
Walk slowly. Walk, walk, walk.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.132
- Run!
- Oh!

18:18.764 --> 18:21.266
Oh, Hank, they are jammed
butt to gut in there.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.392
There's no room.

18:22.476 --> 18:23.977
You said this was war, right?

18:24.061 --> 18:26.021
Well, I'm tired of fighting fair.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.731
We're going to do it your way, Peggy.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.108
The dirty way.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.945
Hold on, I got four more.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.071
You can try.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.958
Bobby, I need an inch.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.837
Montana, here we come.

19:00.264 --> 19:03.058
Wait. Stop the bus.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.483
Y'all have a Happy Thanksgiving.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.863
No, it was not Brown Betty.
No, it was bread.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.367
When I gave up my place on that bus,

19:20.367 --> 19:24.288
I assumed the food court would be open.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.626
Well, I told my mother
we weren't going to make it,

19:29.710 --> 19:31.420
and she was disappointed.

19:31.795 --> 19:33.005
And, Luanne...

19:33.005 --> 19:35.215
Honey, I'm sorry, but your father...

19:35.299 --> 19:37.509
Your father had to go back to the oil rig.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.595
There were no flight delays in Montana.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.890
- The temperature's been in the mid-70s.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.391
- Oh, no!

19:44.391 --> 19:46.685
They went swimming.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.103
Hey, Boomhauer.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.855
I'm sorry you didn't get
to see your mother.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.648
Hey, man, you want
to talk about sorry, man.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.942
That dang ol' stewardess. Dang born again.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.278
Talkin' about a damn old cold shower.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.741
Four hours stuck on the tarmac.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.993
I look out window, what do I see?

20:02.993 --> 20:04.494
A frozen Gribble.

20:04.578 --> 20:06.538
The only thing that kept me going

20:06.622 --> 20:08.957
was my will to smoke again,

20:09.541 --> 20:12.419
and the ashtrays from an Alitalia flight.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.296
Well, there you are, Nancy.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.340
I've been searching
all over the airport for you.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.259
Oh, Dale, I searched for you as well.

20:23.305 --> 20:27.392
This is the worst Thanksgiving ever.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.653
Come on, everybody.

20:37.653 --> 20:40.197
We've all got a lot to be thankful about.

20:40.572 --> 20:44.785
It doesn't matter if we're in Montana
or California or Miami.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.787
The important thing is we're all together.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.997
So, let's have our Thanksgiving dinner.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.875
Now, uh, I've got a stick of gum.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.211
I was saving it for the airplane.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.421
You know, to pop my ears.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.509
I have some leftover pizza
from Papa Capone's.

21:00.509 --> 21:03.470
Yo, man, I got them
dang ol' airplane nuts, man.

21:03.470 --> 21:05.847
I got a dang ol' bags of them, man.
That's all I got.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.724
I have a can of yams.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.602
Well, I got some turkey
and all the trimmings.

21:10.686 --> 21:14.022
Actually, I don't have anything. I...

21:14.106 --> 21:16.108
I don't even have an Uncle Stan.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.317
I made him up.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.027
- Yeah, yeah, kind of figured that.
- Mm-hm.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.362
Very sad.

21:20.362 --> 21:23.073
I guess cold pizza's better than nothing.

21:23.073 --> 21:25.117
It doesn't have to be cold.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.748
Okay, as is tradition,

21:32.040 --> 21:35.419
I will now carve the Thanksgiving pizza.

21:35.419 --> 21:38.422
Wait a second. With those sugar packets,

21:38.422 --> 21:41.591
these pats of margarine,
some leftover pizza crust,

21:41.675 --> 21:43.051
and that propane grill,

21:43.135 --> 21:45.721
I can jerry-bake us up a Brown Betty!

21:45.721 --> 21:47.931
Well, you do make
the best Brown Betty in the...

21:48.015 --> 21:48.932
Yes, I do.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.013
<i>I hate Thanksgiving!</i>
