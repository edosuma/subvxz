00:18.393 --> 00:21.396
(PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.358
Move, move, move, move, move!

00:38.205 --> 00:42.584
I still can't make it out. Try to filter out
the subspace RF interference.

00:42.668 --> 00:43.752
Carter?

00:43.836 --> 00:47.965
Colonel! This is the fifth incoming
wormhole in the last hour and a half.

00:48.048 --> 00:51.969
All right. I'm here two hours early.
When did you get here?

00:52.845 --> 00:54.721
I haven't left yet.

00:54.847 --> 00:59.059
- Didn't I order you to get a life?
- Yes, sir, you did, but this is...

00:59.393 --> 01:01.520
They sent a radio signal this time?

01:01.645 --> 01:05.566
Yeah, but the frequency is distorted
just outside our equipment range.

01:05.649 --> 01:08.402
We're trying to make the adjustment.

01:09.695 --> 01:11.196
What are you doing here?

01:11.280 --> 01:14.783
Someone's trying to contact us.
How often does that happen?

01:14.867 --> 01:18.370
- We can receive now, Major.
- Pipe it through the speakers.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.248
Try to match it so we can
transmit back from our end.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.583
(feedback)

01:22.708 --> 01:26.795
I repeat. This is Euronda base.
Have you reached the otherside?

01:26.879 --> 01:30.132
- Oh, my God!
- Tralan, please respond.

01:30.215 --> 01:33.218
This is Major Carter
of the United States Air Force.

01:33.302 --> 01:36.221
It is imperative that you send no one else
through the gate.

01:36.305 --> 01:38.599
They can't hear you yet, Major.

01:38.724 --> 01:43.187
Historians believe this Stargate is
a portal to the world ofourancestors.

01:43.312 --> 01:48.609
Your kindred are besieged by a powerful
enemy, unwilling to listen to reason.

01:48.692 --> 01:53.071
Our supplies are all but gone. Our
defences are on the verge ofcollapse.

01:53.155 --> 01:55.199
Help us, please!

01:57.618 --> 01:59.244
Damn!

02:00.037 --> 02:04.041
All right, there were four offworld
activations prior to this one...

02:04.124 --> 02:06.168
..and the iris was closed all the time.

02:06.293 --> 02:09.795
How many impact events
did the computer record?

02:13.300 --> 02:15.177
Three.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.722
So... three dead.

02:19.932 --> 02:21.558
Yes, sir.

02:21.683 --> 02:24.228
I'm gonna go look up Euronda.

02:30.025 --> 02:33.362
It's not your fault, Carter. Move on.

02:36.365 --> 02:38.408
Yes, sir.

03:50.272 --> 03:55.152
Your kindred are besieged by a powerful
enemy, unwilling to listen to reason.

03:55.611 --> 04:00.073
Our supplies are all but gone. Our
defences are on the verge ofcollapse.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.284
Help us, please!

04:03.076 --> 04:07.289
All right. Assuming they make contact
again and transmit their coordinates,...

04:07.372 --> 04:09.750
..what help can we seriously offer?

04:09.875 --> 04:12.252
Food, clothing, medical supplies...

04:12.628 --> 04:15.631
Clearly they seek military assistance
above all else.

04:15.714 --> 04:19.551
- God knows who they're up against.
- They themselves may be Goa'uld.

04:19.676 --> 04:23.889
- Such a ruse is within their tactics.
- I don't think that's the case, Teal'c.

04:23.972 --> 04:27.226
They call themselves our "kindred".

04:27.309 --> 04:30.187
Some of whom have already
met their deaths on the iris.

04:30.270 --> 04:34.983
That's hardly the ground
on which to build diplomatic relations.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.944
(Stargate alarm)

04:38.111 --> 04:41.365
Sir, we have another offworld activation.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.535
We've made the adjustments, Major.

04:44.660 --> 04:47.371
Two-way communication
shouldn't be a problem.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.498
Thank you, Sergeant.

04:53.001 --> 04:56.839
This is Alar ofthe nation-state
ofEuronda. Ifanyone can hearme...

04:56.964 --> 05:02.636
Alar, this is General Hammond, United
States Air Force. Can you hear me?

05:02.761 --> 05:08.308
Yes. And may I say, General, that
your voice answers ourprayers?

05:08.392 --> 05:12.062
We've heard your message and are
considering your request for help.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.232
I am prepared to step through
the portal immediately.

05:15.357 --> 05:18.527
- We cannot allow that.
- May I ask why?

05:18.610 --> 05:23.740
We have in place an impenetrable shield -
an iris - that would result in your death.

05:23.824 --> 05:27.744
Then... the three volunteers
we sent through the portal...?

05:29.204 --> 05:32.875
There was no way to determine
if they were friend or foe.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.210
I see.

05:35.294 --> 05:38.005
And... that is still the case.

05:39.298 --> 05:42.092
Clearly, we must gain your trust.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.139
They're transmitting visual.

05:47.264 --> 05:50.934
Now you can see foryourself
that we are kindred.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.812
- We do.
- There is much mypeople have to offer...

05:53.896 --> 05:57.983
..in exchange foryourhelp.
Ifl could speak with you in person...

05:58.066 --> 06:01.320
We need to know more about
this enemy you're facing.

06:01.695 --> 06:05.199
We have coexisted on this world
for centuries.

06:05.324 --> 06:10.120
Now they occupy the majority
ofEuronda's landmass.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.457
That rules out anybody we know.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.918
How have you managed
to survive for so long?

06:16.251 --> 06:22.007
Our facility is deep underground,
protected by defence fiields,...

06:22.090 --> 06:24.843
..and our weapons technology
is farsuperior.

06:24.927 --> 06:30.849
But now one or two oftheirbombers
penetrate ourairspace each day.

06:30.974 --> 06:34.895
- How did you find us?
- We discovered the Stargate...

06:35.020 --> 06:37.898
..while creating tunnels
for our defence facilities.

06:37.981 --> 06:41.652
There were writings on the ancient stone
it was buried beneath.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.029
(explosion)

06:44.112 --> 06:46.406
- We are underattack.
- (explosion)

06:47.157 --> 06:49.993
I must return to the warroom.

06:52.371 --> 06:55.707
Please... help us.

07:02.631 --> 07:05.300
So what do we do?

07:05.384 --> 07:09.137
Nothing can be done, Daniel Jackson,
without their coordinates.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.640
We've got them.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.852
He transmitted them before disengaging.

07:20.649 --> 07:24.069
I know it seems hopeless and
there are unanswered questions,...

07:24.194 --> 07:28.991
..but this is the first time that descendants
of Earth have actually called home.

07:29.074 --> 07:33.078
I mean, either we try to do something
or we let them die.

07:36.582 --> 07:38.876
It's your call, sir.

07:39.001 --> 07:41.044
- Colonel...
- I know what you'll say,...

07:41.170 --> 07:44.506
- You have a go.
- ..but from a humanitarian point of view...

07:44.590 --> 07:45.674
What?

07:45.757 --> 07:50.304
We cannot and would not devote the
resources to turn the tide of a world war.

07:50.387 --> 07:55.267
However, as Dr Jackson points out,
there are humanitarian concerns.

07:55.350 --> 07:59.646
We'll start with all the food and
medical supplies you can take with you.

07:59.771 --> 08:02.858
- Major, perhaps...
- We're on it, sir.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.282
Colonel.

08:10.365 --> 08:14.286
Humanitarian concerns aside,
this may be an advanced civilisation...

08:14.411 --> 08:17.998
..willing to exchange technology
to help us against the Goa'uld.

08:18.081 --> 08:21.585
- My thoughts, sir.
- I've already talked to the president.

08:21.710 --> 08:27.090
If the Eurondan government is open
to trade, you're authorised to negotiate.

08:47.277 --> 08:50.030
SG-1 , you're to report back
within 24 hours.

08:50.113 --> 08:53.200
If you do not,
your GDOs will be locked out.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.831
You've got that look.

08:58.956 --> 09:01.166
To which look are you referring, O'Neill?

09:01.291 --> 09:05.420
The one that says "I have misgivings,
but deep down I know it's right"?

09:05.504 --> 09:08.340
No. The other one.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.050
Oh.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.739
(man groans)

09:38.328 --> 09:40.372
You have come.

09:40.497 --> 09:43.750
It's Alar, sir. He needs medical attention.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.174
Teal'c, gimme a hand here.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.885
Halt!

09:53.218 --> 09:55.095
Disarm. Now!

09:55.220 --> 09:58.724
- Where did you come from?
- These are our kindred of Earth.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.143
They have come to save us.

10:17.492 --> 10:20.996
I was on my way to the Stargate
to contact you again.

10:21.121 --> 10:25.584
The defence field is down to
minimum sustainable strength.

10:26.793 --> 10:30.464
I told you our kindred
would come, Farrell.

10:30.547 --> 10:33.884
You'll win the People's Medal for this.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.803
Bombing's eased up.

10:36.887 --> 10:41.058
We are far more protected here,
where the defence field is strongest,...

10:41.141 --> 10:45.312
..than in the tunnels
where we discovered the Stargate.

10:47.773 --> 10:50.234
How's your head?

10:50.317 --> 10:53.820
Well enough to show you
what you have come to save.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.698
Easy. You might have a concussion.

10:56.782 --> 11:02.621
No, our beta-cantin assures
an immediate recovery, Major.

11:02.871 --> 11:05.165
I'm quite fine.

11:05.707 --> 11:10.170
- Supplies are being distributed now.
- Apparently they need everything.

11:10.254 --> 11:13.340
- Who is this?
- Alar, this is Teal'c.

11:15.968 --> 11:20.264
- You are not of their kin.
- I am, in fact, a Jaffa.

11:20.389 --> 11:23.475
Like you, my ancestors are
descendants of the Tauri.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.061
The Tauri is Earth.

11:27.396 --> 11:29.690
He's part of our team.

11:30.983 --> 11:33.026
Is he?

11:33.861 --> 11:35.821
Then... welcome.

11:38.991 --> 11:41.034
Come!

11:50.794 --> 11:52.921
(Teal'c) You appear to be a leader.

11:53.046 --> 11:57.759
I am accorded the respect of my father,
one of our leaders when the war began.

11:57.843 --> 12:01.180
Now we are fewer in numbers,
we each share in the daily work.

12:01.305 --> 12:04.725
You do know the Stargate can transport
your people to other worlds?

12:04.808 --> 12:06.059
Yes.

12:06.143 --> 12:11.607
- Then why haven't you tried to evacuate?
- Because of what I'm about to show you.

12:35.631 --> 12:38.091
They're in stasis.

12:39.801 --> 12:44.765
Their functions are regulated so that their
hearts beat but once every few minutes.

12:44.890 --> 12:49.937
We had no choice but to live underground
and this facility's resources are limited.

12:50.062 --> 12:54.358
It was the only way to preserve
the generation of my father.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.652
May they be revived again?

12:56.777 --> 12:59.613
Not until the day we reclaim our world.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.157
How many are there?

13:02.282 --> 13:07.621
Thousands sleep here. Thousands more
in another chamber like this one.

13:10.749 --> 13:14.086
Awaiting the end of a war
that will not end.

13:37.818 --> 13:41.572
From this room we conduct
our national defence.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.532
- For all of Euronda?
- Yes.

13:43.615 --> 13:46.076
A single enemy recon drone
approaches, sir.

13:46.410 --> 13:48.203
Thank you, Controller.

13:48.287 --> 13:53.917
Each station is capable of piloting
a formation of unmanned aero-fighters.

13:57.379 --> 14:03.135
Because of these men and women,
enemy bombers rarely return home.

14:04.261 --> 14:06.638
Most impressive.

14:06.722 --> 14:09.892
- What about ground attack?
- The fighters could deter it,...

14:10.017 --> 14:14.104
..but the enemy has not risked
such an attack in several years.

14:14.563 --> 14:17.900
For what reason? You are both
outnumbered and surrounded.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.818
They could press their advantage.

14:19.943 --> 14:24.656
The atmosphere of Euronda has been
poisoned. The surface is unlivable.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.408
Um... ahem!

14:26.491 --> 14:29.244
Then forgive me if this sounds, uh...

14:29.786 --> 14:33.874
- What is there left to fight over?
- It will not always be this way.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.710
An enemy craft is approaching.

14:36.793 --> 14:40.297
Would any of you care to
attempt to shoot it down?

14:42.007 --> 14:47.137
It is an unmanned reconnaissance drone
sent for bomb-damage assessment.

14:47.221 --> 14:50.807
- Unmanned?
- Think of it as a demonstration, Colonel.

14:50.933 --> 14:54.603
Are not your people more likely to be
forthcoming with assistance...

14:54.686 --> 14:57.940
..if we have something
to offer in exchange?

15:00.359 --> 15:02.402
Sure.

15:12.246 --> 15:15.165
So does this thing take quarters, or...?

15:21.004 --> 15:25.133
You will find the weapons system most
intuitive. Hand controls are secondary.

15:25.217 --> 15:30.430
Targeting and vectoring occur
as a result of direct neural interface.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.266
Carter?

15:32.349 --> 15:35.435
It'll do whatever
your mind wants it to do, sir.

15:35.519 --> 15:37.563
Ah.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.733
Whoa! Thing's fast.

15:42.067 --> 15:46.613
You are piloting several
aero-fighters at once in formation.

15:50.534 --> 15:52.661
Yeah, got it. 1 1 o'clock.

15:56.707 --> 15:59.001
Looks like a biplane.

16:10.387 --> 16:12.764
Nice.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.104
Well done.

16:19.188 --> 16:22.065
Yeah! Not bad...

16:23.525 --> 16:25.986
Not bad for an old guy, huh?

16:33.535 --> 16:37.039
- What's with him?
- Ollan is one of our best pilots, Colonel,...

16:37.122 --> 16:41.251
..but he's spent most of
his adult life in that chair.

16:41.335 --> 16:45.088
Years of exposure to
the neural interface is damaging.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.382
Very few of us, including myself,...

16:47.466 --> 16:51.845
..can ever pilot again without
risking what has happened to Ollan.

16:51.929 --> 16:53.722
Excuse me?

16:53.847 --> 16:58.644
Rest assured, Colonel, your brief
exposure will cause you no harm.

16:58.769 --> 17:02.606
Now... come.
Let us celebrate our new alliance.

17:18.664 --> 17:23.292
I intended to save this bottle
to toast the end of the war.

17:23.377 --> 17:28.715
May the friendship between our worlds
be the first step toward that end.

17:29.383 --> 17:31.760
To friendship.

17:32.135 --> 17:34.179
- To friendship.
- To friendship.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.431
- Friendship.
- Friendship.

17:46.692 --> 17:49.444
You... did not join in the pledge.

17:50.487 --> 17:52.948
I do not consume alcohol.

17:55.492 --> 17:57.786
Were you impressed
by our weapons system?

17:57.870 --> 18:00.706
Oh, yeah. We'll take a dozen.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.586
This food you have brought
is most flavourful.

18:05.669 --> 18:08.046
We can do much better, believe me.

18:08.172 --> 18:13.051
We have survived on nothing more than
hydroponically grown yeasts for years.

18:13.177 --> 18:14.678
Is that what this is?

18:14.761 --> 18:17.764
Your power-generation requirements
must be enormous.

18:17.890 --> 18:21.393
Do you not utilise
controlled fusion on Earth?

18:21.476 --> 18:23.520
Controlled...?

18:24.313 --> 18:28.233
It is a most efficient means
of power generation.

18:28.317 --> 18:33.197
Unfortunately the deuterium oxide fuel
we require to operate our reactors...

18:33.280 --> 18:35.324
..is now in short supply.

18:35.407 --> 18:40.454
Heavy water. It's like regular water, sir,
except the hydrogen nucleus contains...

18:40.537 --> 18:43.165
I know what heavy water is, Major.

18:47.085 --> 18:51.465
And if that's what the Eurondans need,
we'd be happy to provide it.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.258
(Eurondans gasp)

18:53.383 --> 18:59.014
In return we can teach your people how to
construct weapons systems such as ours.

18:59.473 --> 19:03.477
Aero-fighters, stasis devices,
fusion reactors...

19:03.685 --> 19:05.729
Sounds fair.

19:07.231 --> 19:08.065
Carter?

19:08.148 --> 19:10.275
- Medicine, sir.
- Oh, right. Um...

19:10.400 --> 19:15.280
We were very impressed with
that beta-caro... candy stuff.

19:16.156 --> 19:18.200
Beta-cantin. Of course.

19:18.325 --> 19:21.411
- Jack?
- Daniel.

19:21.662 --> 19:24.039
Shouldn't we ask what
the heavy water is for?

19:24.122 --> 19:27.459
- I don't think so.
- The power generated by it...

19:27.543 --> 19:31.630
..would be used to reinforce
our defences, Dr Jackson.

19:32.631 --> 19:34.675
Daniel?

19:35.425 --> 19:38.387
And, in due course,
to strike back at the enemy.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.475
- Jack?
- Daniel,...

19:43.600 --> 19:45.894
..shouldn't we discuss this
another time?

19:45.978 --> 19:48.438
No, I don't think so.

19:48.522 --> 19:52.985
Surely you understand our desire to end
a war that has lasted for a generation?

19:53.193 --> 19:55.237
No, I do understand that, Alar.

19:55.362 --> 20:00.576
But the Stargate, because it can transport
your people to another world entirely...

20:00.659 --> 20:04.955
But I have told you -
thousands of our people are in stasis.

20:05.038 --> 20:07.332
Take them out of stasis
and find a new home.

20:07.457 --> 20:11.712
Then what would all this have been for?
This is our home.

20:11.795 --> 20:16.341
I just don't understand why you would
continue a war when there's a choice.

20:16.466 --> 20:19.469
Daniel... You heard the man.

20:20.637 --> 20:25.851
You said yourself the atmosphere is
poisoned. What is there left to win?

20:26.268 --> 20:28.562
(explosions)

20:33.400 --> 20:36.486
Alar, enemy bombers have
penetrated the outer perimeter.

20:36.612 --> 20:39.865
- Defence stations.
- Please excuse us.

20:39.948 --> 20:43.869
We'll be in the war room
once you reach your decision.

20:49.917 --> 20:52.920
- Next time I tell you to shut up...
- I didn't hear that.

20:53.003 --> 20:55.547
- Too subtle for you?
- Yes. Would you hear me out?

20:55.672 --> 20:57.633
Carter?

20:57.758 --> 21:00.135
Our standing orders. What are they?

21:00.219 --> 21:05.098
To seek new allies and technologies
to aid in the defence against the Goa'uld.

21:05.182 --> 21:10.479
- And have we carried out those orders?
- We came here to help them.

21:10.562 --> 21:13.732
- Is that not what we are doing?
- No!

21:13.857 --> 21:17.778
Their world is in flames and we're
offering gasoline. How is that help?

21:17.861 --> 21:20.322
- We are in fact offering water.
- Thank you.

21:20.447 --> 21:25.577
- I was speaking metaphorically.
- Well, stop it! It's not fair to Teal'c.

21:25.869 --> 21:28.247
Decision's made.

21:28.914 --> 21:32.751
This mission isn't about helping them.
We're here to help ourselves.

21:32.835 --> 21:36.588
Carter, take Daniel back with you.
Tell Hammond we struck a deal.

21:36.672 --> 21:41.718
You don't give a damn about them.
You're taking advantage of their situation.

21:41.802 --> 21:43.846
Yes. I am, Daniel.

21:43.929 --> 21:46.849
They get something they want.
We get everything we want.

21:46.932 --> 21:50.602
- I don't have a problem with that. Carter!
- We're on our way, sir.

21:50.686 --> 21:53.605
- This conversation isn't over.
- You're right, Daniel.

21:53.689 --> 21:57.526
- It's never over with you.
- This has got nothing to do with me.

21:57.651 --> 22:01.738
- Do you realise what they're offering?
- At what price?

22:02.573 --> 22:04.074
Oh, for cryin' out loud...

22:04.158 --> 22:07.661
- Where you goin'?
- To see what I can do to help!

22:20.007 --> 22:22.676
I am not defending him, Daniel.
I agree with him.

22:22.759 --> 22:25.512
Don't you realise what we'd be doing?

22:26.597 --> 22:29.141
Major? Doctor?

22:29.808 --> 22:35.898
Sir, Colonel O'Neill has negotiated access
to every advanced Eurondan technology...

22:35.981 --> 22:38.859
..in exchange for an unknown
quantity of heavy water.

22:38.942 --> 22:40.903
- That's all they want?
- That's all.

22:40.986 --> 22:45.282
- What do they want it for?
- Thank you for asking the question.

22:45.365 --> 22:50.412
- Heavy water contains deuterium.
- Which can be used in nuclear weapons.

22:50.537 --> 22:53.707
Yes, but they use it to fuel
nuclear fusion generators.

22:53.790 --> 22:54.625
Fusion?

22:54.750 --> 22:58.253
Alar says the additional power
would be enough to stave off defeat.

22:58.337 --> 23:01.840
- They'll share that technology too?
- Of course. They're desperate.

23:01.965 --> 23:04.801
Yes, sir. Everything. And it is incredible.

23:04.885 --> 23:07.763
They are a hundred years
ahead of us, maybe more.

23:07.846 --> 23:10.599
But if we don't act soon,
they will be overrun.

23:10.682 --> 23:14.186
- Sergeant Siler?
- I'll get right on it, sir.

23:15.979 --> 23:18.273
Doctor, you don't approve.

23:19.274 --> 23:24.613
You said that we could not and would not
devote the resources to win a war.

23:24.696 --> 23:28.617
Obviously I was speaking in terms
of military assets. Human lives.

23:28.742 --> 23:31.286
- But there was a moral issue.
- Yes.

23:31.411 --> 23:37.668
But if we provide all that in the form of
water, then the moral issue... evaporates?

23:40.546 --> 23:44.758
I shouldn't have to remind you
that Apophis is alive...

23:44.842 --> 23:49.638
..and at present capable of wiping us from
the face of this Earth without contest.

23:49.721 --> 23:53.642
It is the mandate of this organisation
to make sure that doesn't happen.

23:53.725 --> 23:56.019
I understand that. I do.

24:02.609 --> 24:05.863
We've only seen one side of this.
Do we know why they're fighting?

24:05.988 --> 24:08.991
- For their lives.
- Yes. I was all for saving those lives.

24:09.116 --> 24:12.536
But we're about to go
way, way, way beyond that.

24:12.619 --> 24:16.206
We're about to turn the tide of a world war
that we know nothing about,...

24:16.290 --> 24:19.251
..against an enemy
that we know nothing about.

24:19.334 --> 24:25.090
Is that the right way to get technology?
Yes. But is it the right thing to do?

24:25.174 --> 24:27.217
It's a fair question, sir.

24:29.261 --> 24:31.930
Yes, it is.

24:34.975 --> 24:40.314
Send a formation to the west. They are
amassing bombers there. How long?

24:40.397 --> 24:42.941
Carter and Jackson
will return as soon as they can.

24:43.025 --> 24:44.818
There are too many.

24:44.943 --> 24:47.571
- Use a couple more pilots?
- Yes!

24:55.496 --> 24:58.749
(controller) Aero-fighter squadron,
deck three. Target.

25:00.292 --> 25:03.462
Enemy bombers incoming,
bearing zero, zero.

25:03.587 --> 25:05.088
I see 'em.

25:12.930 --> 25:15.849
- This is all you could bring?
- On short notice, yes.

25:15.933 --> 25:18.310
- This will not last a day!
- There's more coming.

25:18.393 --> 25:20.854
We brought what little we could
as soon as possible.

25:20.979 --> 25:24.316
- More is on the way. You're certain?
- Much more, yes.

25:24.399 --> 25:27.736
Add the fuel to the reactors.
Set the defence field to full power.

25:27.861 --> 25:33.492
A demonstration to the enemy. We must
show them that we are strong once more.

25:35.744 --> 25:37.871
In the meantime, we have questions...

25:37.955 --> 25:43.585
Yes, yes. As soon as the attack is over,
we will provide all we have promised.

25:45.003 --> 25:47.464
Come. It isn't safe.

25:51.134 --> 25:54.012
- Enemy bombers over the city.
- Teal'c, target the lead bomber.

25:54.096 --> 25:56.974
- I'll take the other one.
- I have it, O'Neill.

26:26.170 --> 26:29.673
- That sounded close.
- Directly above us, in the old city.

26:29.798 --> 26:36.305
Let me show you another of the wonders
we will share with you for all you've done.

26:36.430 --> 26:41.310
The field generator can repel the force
of many bombs like a great shield.

26:41.435 --> 26:46.064
It has saved our people from destruction
for my entire life.

26:49.067 --> 26:53.697
You see? The fuel you brought
has strengthened it again.

26:54.573 --> 26:56.950
How long will that last?

26:57.034 --> 26:59.244
For several hours.

26:59.369 --> 27:03.415
I'm certain we'll be able to send
more heavy water by then.

27:08.253 --> 27:10.547
Mine's goin' for the deck.

27:30.651 --> 27:32.694
God!

27:35.113 --> 27:39.201
- O'Neill, are you all right?
- Enemy bomber destroyed.

27:40.202 --> 27:41.537
What was that?

27:41.620 --> 27:44.581
Your lead aero-fighter
struck an enemy bomber head on.

27:44.665 --> 27:48.919
I saw people in that thing.
You said they were unmanned.

27:49.002 --> 27:51.839
I said the reconnaissance craft
was unmanned.

27:51.922 --> 27:55.259
It was an easy target and
therefore a suitable demonstration.

27:55.384 --> 27:57.761
But their bombers are manned.

27:57.886 --> 28:02.850
You have killed several of our enemy,
Colonel, and we are grateful.

28:16.697 --> 28:18.991
(Eurondans) He is remembered.

28:23.996 --> 28:27.082
For whom do you pledge
this remembrance?

28:27.166 --> 28:31.962
My father. Through his vision,
our nation has survived.

28:32.629 --> 28:35.174
I see.

28:38.594 --> 28:44.516
It is customary among our people to
formalise new alliances such as ours.

28:45.726 --> 28:50.439
In exchange for all our knowledge,
technology, medicines,...

28:51.106 --> 28:53.233
..Earth will provide us...

28:53.358 --> 28:59.031
..with however much heavy water as we
require to end this war once and for all.

29:00.407 --> 29:05.287
Do not be alarmed. Merely three or four
times that which you have just provided,...

29:05.370 --> 29:07.414
..on a daily basis.

29:07.539 --> 29:10.209
That adds up to several
metric tons a year, sir.

29:10.292 --> 29:14.129
It's a small price to pay
for what we offer in return.

29:14.254 --> 29:16.298
Alar, listen.

29:21.929 --> 29:24.223
- What?
- Silence.

29:25.724 --> 29:28.101
I hardly recognise it.

29:28.227 --> 29:34.066
At full strength, our defence field makes
us as invulnerable as when I was a boy.

29:34.858 --> 29:39.655
I propose that we write into words
what we already share in our hearts.

29:39.780 --> 29:43.534
Ahem! Before we do that,
I have a question.

29:43.659 --> 29:45.953
General Hammond would
also like to know, sir.

29:46.078 --> 29:48.747
It's all right, Colonel. I don't mind.

29:49.540 --> 29:51.834
How did this war start?

29:52.876 --> 29:57.923
The first enemy bombs fell on Euronda
in a surprise attack.

29:58.966 --> 30:03.136
I was a boy of nine. I remember that night.

30:03.387 --> 30:08.767
I remember the floor of the room
in which my father had sequestered me...

30:08.851 --> 30:11.061
..shook with each explosion.

30:11.144 --> 30:16.024
I remember knowing that
each bomber that got through...

30:16.358 --> 30:20.821
..meant that another building,
another home,...

30:21.947 --> 30:25.617
..another street
in the city above me was gone.

30:27.119 --> 30:31.039
That is how this war began, Doctor.

30:31.832 --> 30:34.376
And for that we have only your word.

30:34.960 --> 30:40.966
Three of our best men died attempting
to reach Earth through your Stargate.

30:41.049 --> 30:45.179
- That was an accident.
- And we have only your word.

30:51.310 --> 30:53.770
Any more questions, Daniel?

30:54.104 --> 30:57.274
Yes. I'd like to know
more about your enemy.

30:58.400 --> 31:01.904
Is this part of your bargaining process,
Colonel?

31:01.987 --> 31:03.155
Not normally.

31:03.238 --> 31:06.992
What more can we promise
than everything we have?

31:07.242 --> 31:09.870
Why don't you just answer the question?

31:09.953 --> 31:13.624
- Colonel, do we have an agreement?
- We do.

31:13.749 --> 31:16.835
- Jack.
- Daniel... Shut up.

31:20.214 --> 31:22.508
Is that clear enough?

31:27.930 --> 31:32.643
Sir, if you're gonna go back, I would like
to take a look at their fusion technology.

31:32.768 --> 31:34.478
Fine.

31:34.561 --> 31:37.898
It would be my pleasure
to show you personally.

31:48.283 --> 31:53.664
I understand you shot down an enemy
bomber for us, Colonel. Congratulations.

31:53.747 --> 31:58.293
- Perhaps you'll try your hand at it again.
- I don't think so.

31:58.418 --> 32:04.174
Well, if you're concerned about lives lost,
remember they're yourenemy now.

32:05.592 --> 32:07.970
I look forward to your return.

32:08.971 --> 32:14.434
Which reminds me - perhaps it would
be best if the Jaffa did not return.

32:15.519 --> 32:18.480
Teal'c? Why? He hasn't said a word.

32:19.273 --> 32:23.277
It's not what he said. It's what he is.

32:24.862 --> 32:29.491
- Well, he's different. I'll grant you that.
- Not like us.

32:34.121 --> 32:36.165
Right.

32:37.416 --> 32:39.459
Major Carter, after you.

32:49.303 --> 32:51.597
We're not goin'.

32:52.639 --> 32:54.099
Why?

32:54.183 --> 32:57.186
Teal'c and I are gonna
have a look around first.

32:57.311 --> 33:00.105
You... ask questions.

33:01.064 --> 33:04.151
- I thought you told me to...
- I know what I said, Daniel.

33:04.234 --> 33:07.321
It was rude, short-sighted, and I'm sorry.

33:08.489 --> 33:11.116
Well, thank you for recognising that.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.327
Now I'm saying this.

33:13.452 --> 33:17.289
Go ask questions. Lots of questions.

33:27.674 --> 33:33.180
One single fusion reactor is capable of
generating power for the entire facility.

33:33.263 --> 33:36.433
I assume you extract
deuterium from seawater.

33:36.683 --> 33:39.937
Yes. 70%%% of the Earth's surface is ocean,...

33:40.062 --> 33:43.899
..so heavy-water production
shouldn't be a problem.

33:44.024 --> 33:49.071
The sea from which we used to extract
our own "heavy water", as you call it,...

33:49.196 --> 33:53.116
..is now in enemy hands
hundreds of miles away.

33:53.826 --> 33:57.663
You can see that
the storage tanks are nearly empty.

34:00.499 --> 34:04.795
You must have been building this place
long before the war started.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.463
The war was inevitable.

34:06.547 --> 34:09.967
How long did you expect
to stay down here?

34:10.092 --> 34:12.886
Until the air was free from poison.

34:14.596 --> 34:16.639
Excuse me.

34:30.737 --> 34:35.117
- So what's your impression of Alar?
- That he is concealing something.

34:35.199 --> 34:38.536
- Like what?
- I am unsure. He is concealing it.

35:11.153 --> 35:13.614
What is it, O'Neill?

35:15.866 --> 35:18.160
They're the same.

35:24.958 --> 35:27.419
Every damn one of 'em is the same.

35:44.645 --> 35:47.314
- Farrell.
- Doctor.

35:47.397 --> 35:50.234
I just thought that,
since we're going to be allies,...

35:50.317 --> 35:55.280
..l thought we should get to know
a little bit more about our new enemy.

35:58.951 --> 36:01.328
OK, um...

36:01.411 --> 36:04.039
Well, you call them "the enemy".

36:05.415 --> 36:10.128
Understandably - they're your enemy.
But they must have a name.

36:10.754 --> 36:13.549
For example, I'm American.
My grandfather was Dutch.

36:13.632 --> 36:15.759
What do you call them?

36:16.468 --> 36:18.929
Sometimes we call them "breeders".

36:19.054 --> 36:22.224
- Breeders?
- How they reproduce.

36:22.307 --> 36:26.395
Indiscriminately.
With no regard for genetic purity.

36:27.354 --> 36:31.191
Really? So basically
they come in all shapes and sizes.

36:31.525 --> 36:32.943
Yes.

36:33.152 --> 36:35.612
- And colours?
- Yes.

36:37.489 --> 36:39.533
Really?

36:44.621 --> 36:48.709
This storage cylinder contains
plans, specifications and formulas...

36:48.792 --> 36:51.962
..upon which our technology is based.

36:52.045 --> 36:56.216
Together we will find a way to transfer
the information to your computers.

36:56.300 --> 37:00.762
Alar, these pipes extend from
the lowest level right up to the surface.

37:01.305 --> 37:02.723
Yes.

37:02.806 --> 37:07.102
But you said the atmosphere
was poisoned. It doesn't make any sense.

37:07.227 --> 37:08.312
(alarm)

37:08.437 --> 37:12.107
- Enemy bombers approaching perimeter.
- Engage them!

37:21.742 --> 37:23.243
- Jack.
- What'd you find out?

37:23.327 --> 37:27.956
They started the war. I don't know
how they did it, but they did.

37:32.961 --> 37:35.506
- Where is the fuel?
- There's been a delay.

37:35.631 --> 37:38.717
The enemy is attacking in force.
We need that fuel!

37:38.842 --> 37:44.932
We just have to buy a little time. Teal'c
and I can help fight 'em off until it comes.

37:47.059 --> 37:49.102
Do it!

38:02.324 --> 38:04.368
Stay on my wing, Teal'c.

38:05.035 --> 38:08.872
It was a pre-emptive strike.
When your enemy began bombing,...

38:08.997 --> 38:13.293
- ..they were trying to stop you.
- Now is not the time, Major!

38:14.795 --> 38:17.089
The defence field is at minimum strength.

38:17.172 --> 38:19.967
Transfer energy from the stasis room.

38:23.303 --> 38:27.683
They built this place long before the war.
They planned it from the beginning.

38:27.766 --> 38:29.893
But how can they win from underground?

38:29.977 --> 38:34.147
There are enormous gas pipes that run
from tanks underneath this facility...

38:34.231 --> 38:36.859
- ..up to the surface.
- And the surface is poisoned.

38:36.942 --> 38:40.195
They didn't just start a war.
They wanted to exterminate them.

38:40.279 --> 38:42.239
(Alar) It was his vision.

38:42.698 --> 38:48.370
My father saw breeders spreading across
the face of Euronda like a plague.

38:48.495 --> 38:50.205
Millions of them.

38:50.330 --> 38:53.333
We don't know how so many of them
manage to survive.

38:53.542 --> 38:56.712
But they do, in spite of our best efforts.

38:57.963 --> 39:03.177
Contact your General Hammond.
Tell him we need that fuel immediately!

39:04.428 --> 39:06.471
We're not gonna do that.

39:07.431 --> 39:09.474
Armed!

39:10.100 --> 39:12.644
Contact your General Hammond.

39:45.260 --> 39:47.387
They're escorting the enemy bombers!

39:47.513 --> 39:50.682
- He's attacking our own fighters.
- Stop him!

40:20.003 --> 40:22.047
(metal buckles)

40:48.448 --> 40:53.245
- It could have all been yours!
- I wouldn't follow us if I were you.

40:59.209 --> 41:01.253
(screams)

41:16.852 --> 41:18.896
No.

41:24.902 --> 41:26.945
Go!

41:48.342 --> 41:50.385
Wait! Wait!

41:53.013 --> 41:56.934
I can teach you everything I know.
Just let me come with you.

41:58.352 --> 42:00.312
Please!

42:11.782 --> 42:14.243
- Close the iris.
- Do it.

42:27.297 --> 42:31.760
I take it, Colonel, that you were unable
to procure the Eurondan technologies.

42:31.844 --> 42:33.887
That's correct, sir.

42:36.056 --> 42:38.100
I'm sorry to hear that.

42:39.601 --> 42:41.645
Don't be.

42:43.230 --> 42:47.067
- We'll debrief in one hour.
- Yes, sir.

42:48.305 --> 42:54.850
