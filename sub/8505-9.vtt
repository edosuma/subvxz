00:07.967 --> 00:09.677
<i>Previously on</i> Agent Carter...

00:09.760 --> 00:11.721
Whitney Frost shot my wife.
I'm coming with you.

00:11.804 --> 00:13.014
No, you're going back to the hospital.

00:13.097 --> 00:14.682
I want her to pay for what she did to us.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.517
- They're fake.
- Move! Move!

00:16.600 --> 00:18.185
Those are fake. Stop them!

00:19.520 --> 00:21.105
- Where are the rods?
- Jason, stop this.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.398
I know how you feel about her.

00:22.481 --> 00:23.524
Daniel, don't listen to him.

00:23.816 --> 00:24.859
- Where?
- No!

00:24.942 --> 00:26.193
Wall safe at the SSR lab.

00:26.277 --> 00:28.404
- He was gonna shoot you.
- Yes, he was.

00:28.487 --> 00:30.239
So if the situation was reversed,
that's what you would've done?

00:30.322 --> 00:31.365
Let him shoot me?

00:31.449 --> 00:34.035
Two hours ago, you were
using a redacted file to frame me.

00:34.118 --> 00:35.828
If I were helping them,
I'd be on my way there.

00:35.911 --> 00:36.954
But I'm here with you.

00:37.038 --> 00:38.456
<i>The rift will open.</i>

00:39.123 --> 00:42.209
<i>Zero matter will pour out,
and you and I will absorb it.</i>

00:42.293 --> 00:44.128
No! What about me?

00:44.211 --> 00:45.963
We need to close the rift.

00:46.922 --> 00:47.965
Dr Wilkes.

00:48.049 --> 00:49.633
- Whitney Frost!
- Something happened...

00:49.717 --> 00:51.719
No! What did you do?

00:51.802 --> 00:53.471
- You're gonna pay for that.
- Keep them alive.

00:53.554 --> 00:54.722
The key to controlling him

00:54.805 --> 00:57.224
is to control those that he loves.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.608
Hello?

01:07.526 --> 01:08.903
Daniel?

01:10.321 --> 01:11.614
Rose?

01:14.158 --> 01:15.659
Anyone?

01:16.410 --> 01:17.495
Who turned out...

01:19.914 --> 01:21.165
Colour.

01:25.086 --> 01:26.796
Michael?

01:27.129 --> 01:29.131
Come now, Peggy. Black and white?

01:29.215 --> 01:31.634
Couldn't you have made this experience
a bit more vibrant?

01:31.717 --> 01:33.052
What are you doing here?

01:33.135 --> 01:35.179
I could ask you the same question.

01:35.763 --> 01:38.140
You've gotten yourself
into quite a fix this time.

01:38.224 --> 01:40.017
I wouldn't even be in this situation

01:40.101 --> 01:42.937
had you not put me up
for the SOE position to begin with

01:43.020 --> 01:46.190
and then gotten yourself killed
just so I would take up your flag.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.150
Yes.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.444
Very rude of me.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.863
My sincere apologies.

01:53.823 --> 01:55.783
I'm only doing
what you wanted me to do.

01:55.866 --> 01:59.620
No, darling,
you're doing what you wanted to do.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.790
I miss you, Michael.

02:03.874 --> 02:07.378
I'd be here right alongside you
if I could, Peggy.

02:39.118 --> 02:40.202
What'll it be?

02:40.286 --> 02:41.871
Angie, what are you doing here?

02:41.954 --> 02:43.539
Busting my hump working a double.

02:43.622 --> 02:46.083
What about you?
Shouldn't you be working, English?

02:46.458 --> 02:48.210
I... I was in the desert.

02:48.294 --> 02:49.378
You want dessert?

02:49.461 --> 02:51.172
Well, you can't go wrong
with the key lime pie.

02:51.255 --> 02:52.840
No, no, that's not what I said.

02:53.424 --> 02:54.508
What do you want, then?

02:54.592 --> 02:56.427
I don't know what I want.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.013
How about me?

03:00.139 --> 03:01.182
You.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.018
You're angry.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.270
No, I'm not.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.688
You have every right to be.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.565
I did hold a gun to your head.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.109
It wasn't your fault.

03:13.611 --> 03:14.820
You may be right.

03:15.279 --> 03:17.323
I was only doing
what you wanted me to do.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.619
Order up!

03:22.328 --> 03:24.580
Daniel, what in the
bloody blue blazes is happening?

03:25.372 --> 03:28.042
<i>You walk in a room</i>

03:28.667 --> 03:31.462
<i>and nature takes its course</i>

03:33.214 --> 03:35.132
<i>conquers me by force</i>

03:35.716 --> 03:39.136
<i>And with no remorse</i>

03:40.095 --> 03:42.598
<i>baby, I assume</i>

03:43.015 --> 03:46.393
<i>that you always knew</i>

03:46.477 --> 03:47.895
<i>the recipe</i>

03:48.562 --> 03:51.523
<i>It's simply me and you</i>

03:54.401 --> 03:56.904
<i>Love leaves ya blind</i>

03:56.987 --> 04:00.449
<i>Baby, you can read my mind</i>

04:01.283 --> 04:07.456
<i>All that's been left unsaid</i>

04:08.415 --> 04:11.210
<i>You know the score</i>

04:11.293 --> 04:15.214
<i>what I've been waiting for</i>

04:15.297 --> 04:17.549
<i>Whatcha gonna do?</i>

04:17.633 --> 04:18.842
<i>It's up to you</i>

04:23.639 --> 04:24.807
<i>Whatcha gonna do?</i>

04:24.890 --> 04:27.351
<i>- Two hearts are waiting
- Who ya gonna choose?</i>

04:27.434 --> 04:28.644
<i>Stop debating</i>

04:28.727 --> 04:29.937
<i>Who's it gonna be?</i>

04:30.020 --> 04:32.022
<i>Quit vacillating, whatcha gonna do?</i>

04:32.106 --> 04:33.732
<i>It's up to you</i>

04:35.276 --> 04:36.652
What are you doing here?

04:36.735 --> 04:39.196
Aw, Peggy, I'll always be in your head.

04:41.407 --> 04:43.158
<i>You can never fight</i>

04:43.617 --> 04:46.495
<i>the laws of attraction</i>

04:46.578 --> 04:49.290
<i>that chemical reaction</i>

04:49.373 --> 04:50.624
<i>that got us in this mess</i>

04:51.292 --> 04:53.419
<i>Still, I must confess</i>

04:53.502 --> 04:56.422
<i>they're both a nice distraction</i>

04:56.505 --> 05:01.176
<i>Now I clearly see it's up to me</i>

05:01.260 --> 05:02.303
<i>What's it gonna be?</i>

05:02.386 --> 05:03.512
<i>Joy or disaster?</i>

05:03.595 --> 05:04.972
<i>Who's the one that makes</i>

05:05.055 --> 05:06.140
<i>your heart beat faster?</i>

05:06.223 --> 05:07.391
<i>Is it gonna be</i>

05:07.474 --> 05:08.684
<i>happy ever after?</i>

05:08.767 --> 05:09.810
<i>Whatcha gonna do?</i>

05:09.893 --> 05:10.936
<i>It's up to you</i>

05:21.071 --> 05:22.323
<i>Whatcha gonna do?</i>

05:22.406 --> 05:23.574
<i>You got 'em lined up</i>

05:23.657 --> 05:24.867
<i>Who's it gonna be?</i>

05:24.950 --> 05:26.201
<i>Make your mind up</i>

05:26.285 --> 05:27.328
<i>Will ya let us know</i>

05:27.411 --> 05:28.787
<i>which one you signed up?</i>

05:28.871 --> 05:29.913
<i>Whatcha gonna do?</i>

05:29.997 --> 05:31.040
<i>It's up to you</i>

05:31.123 --> 05:32.333
<i>Whatcha gonna do</i>

05:32.416 --> 05:33.876
<i>Time's up for flirting</i>

05:33.959 --> 05:35.002
<i>When ya gonna tell</i>

05:35.085 --> 05:36.211
<i>the one that you're hurting?</i>

05:36.295 --> 05:37.671
<i>When will you decide</i>

05:37.755 --> 05:38.797
<i>who you're desertin'?</i>

05:38.881 --> 05:39.923
<i>Whatcha gonna do?</i>

05:40.007 --> 05:41.675
<i>Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do?</i>

05:41.759 --> 05:43.594
<i>It's up to...</i>

05:43.677 --> 05:46.096
Miss Carter? I hate to interrupt.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.556
Yes, Mr Jarvis?

05:52.186 --> 05:53.687
Wake up.

05:58.692 --> 05:59.777
I'm sorry.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.446
You're just not right
for the Auerbach Theatrical Agency.

06:39.525 --> 06:42.694
So, they're gonna
come back for us, right?

06:42.778 --> 06:47.741
I mean, they have our truck,
our radios, our water.

06:47.825 --> 06:49.910
Something's happened.
It's been over an hour.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.912
Question is,
do we head towards the blast area

06:51.995 --> 06:53.288
or towards civilisation?

06:53.372 --> 06:56.417
Strolling through a cloud of radiation
isn't my first choice.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.419
You're supposed to drink your urine.

07:00.796 --> 07:03.257
When you're dehydrated.
I'm problem-solving. Come on.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.092
Nearest town is at least a day's walk.

07:05.175 --> 07:06.802
Longer if we have to drag
that thing with us.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.471
Look! We're saved!

07:14.017 --> 07:15.102
SSR car.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.271
Vega and Blackwell.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.273
Vernon's guys.

07:19.356 --> 07:20.441
How do you know?

07:20.524 --> 07:22.276
He sent them
to kick the crap out of me.

07:22.359 --> 07:24.069
Blackwell gargles Aqua Velva.

07:24.528 --> 07:27.781
But they're just gonna take us back
to the SSR, right?

07:28.198 --> 07:29.450
I don't think
that's what they have in mind.

07:29.533 --> 07:30.659
What's the play?

07:31.326 --> 07:33.287
- You trust me?
- Not at all.

07:34.288 --> 07:35.372
Good enough.

07:40.002 --> 07:41.044
Where are we?

07:41.962 --> 07:44.131
In a truck in the middle of the desert.

07:44.214 --> 07:45.549
Are you all right, Miss Carter?

07:47.050 --> 07:48.177
Allow me to explain.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.471
Any explanation you have is irrelevant.

07:50.554 --> 07:52.097
I know you disapprove of my actions...

07:52.181 --> 07:53.849
Your actions?
And what actions are those?

07:53.932 --> 07:55.517
When you tried to murder
Whitney Frost in cold blood?

07:56.226 --> 07:57.561
She deserves to die. I will not...

07:57.644 --> 07:58.937
Enough! I'm not listening to this.

07:59.021 --> 08:01.398
Get yourself loose while I find a way
of getting us out of this mess,

08:01.482 --> 08:03.025
which is entirely of your making.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.334
Vega, thank God you found us.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.835
Put Chief Thompson
in the back of the vehicle.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.045
He's under arrest.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.341
You heard the man.
Sometime this week.

08:30.135 --> 08:31.220
Drop the gun, Chief.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.055
What the hell are you doing?

08:33.138 --> 08:36.767
Vernon sent them to kill
whoever pulled the trigger on that thing.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.435
That sound about right, boys?

08:39.019 --> 08:40.938
Doc, put that gun down
before you hurt yourself.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.572
Good work, boys.

08:50.656 --> 08:52.032
Thank you.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.284
Now, let's get these men
back to the SSR.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.495
Vernon's gonna want to hear
what they have to say.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.456
Uh...

08:59.540 --> 09:01.625
- We're supposed to...
- You're supposed to what?

09:04.294 --> 09:06.797
You're supposed to what, Vega?

09:07.714 --> 09:08.966
Kill me, too?

09:09.967 --> 09:12.386
After I followed Carter
out to the ass end of the desert

09:12.469 --> 09:13.804
and tried to stop her?

09:15.138 --> 09:16.765
Don't be an idiot, Vega.

09:17.975 --> 09:20.852
Now get them in that car.

09:33.699 --> 09:35.158
Looks like
you owe me another one, Sousa.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.535
I just saved your life.

09:37.244 --> 09:40.289
You're gonna regret this, Jack.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.958
I doubt it.

10:05.564 --> 10:06.857
Damn.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.276
- Maybe we could...
- I've got it.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.320
What on earth are you doing?

10:12.154 --> 10:16.033
- What is that?
- This is called the hotwire.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.618
Hold the doors open.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.255
Miss Carter, if we're to be successful,

10:30.339 --> 10:32.257
it's important
we're able to work together.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.345
What are we supposed to do now?
Ahhh!

10:41.058 --> 10:43.268
Bloody hell! Are you mad, woman?

10:43.352 --> 10:44.603
Quiet!

10:45.354 --> 10:46.396
Stay down.

10:48.899 --> 10:50.484
Get to the side of the road.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.321
You could've killed me.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.324
Are you or are you not free
from capture, Mr Jarvis?

10:57.407 --> 10:59.451
Oh, yes. How wonderful.

10:59.534 --> 11:00.827
Here we are.

11:01.953 --> 11:04.915
Safe in the middle
of a bleeding wasteland.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.208
What on earth
are we supposed to do now?

11:06.583 --> 11:08.001
We walk.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.713
"We walk"? "We walk"?

11:11.797 --> 11:13.048
This is your grand plan?

11:13.382 --> 11:16.218
Throw me from a moving vehicle
only to kill me in an inferno?

11:16.301 --> 11:17.803
What a magnificent idea!

11:18.345 --> 11:20.555
What skill! What grace under fire!

11:20.639 --> 11:22.015
You've really proven your worth

11:22.099 --> 11:24.059
to God and country this time,
Agent Carter!

11:28.021 --> 11:29.398
Right, then.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.043
Dr Wilkes, you're awake.

11:50.669 --> 11:51.712
How do you feel?

11:52.713 --> 11:54.089
Something's wrong.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.299
You bet your ass
something's wrong.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.051
Your eyes look like two eight balls.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.428
I suppose that's what happens

11:59.511 --> 12:01.221
when you take all the Zero Matter
for yourself, isn't it?

12:01.304 --> 12:02.723
I'm not well.

12:03.515 --> 12:04.641
Hey.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.228
Look, if you're gonna puke,
do it outside.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.563
I just got this car.

12:10.772 --> 12:13.775
You went into the rift.
What did you see?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.068
Nothing.

12:15.152 --> 12:18.238
Just blackness.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.449
But we both saw
the Isodyne test footage,

12:20.532 --> 12:22.242
and no one comes back.

12:22.701 --> 12:25.162
- Why you?
- I don't know.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.377
There.

12:32.461 --> 12:34.254
You look better already.

12:34.337 --> 12:35.922
I'm not better.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.841
I am anything but better.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.886
Yeah, I'm gonna have to agree
with the doc on this one, hon.

12:40.969 --> 12:43.597
His eyes are okay,
but he still looks skeevots to me.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.806
Well, no matter.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.016
We're gonna get you back
to the city now

12:46.099 --> 12:47.267
and fix you right up.

12:47.350 --> 12:48.393
No, no.

12:48.477 --> 12:50.103
No, you can't take me
to a populated area.

12:50.187 --> 12:52.647
I'm not safe around people.

12:53.565 --> 12:55.233
- Hey. Hey!
- Let me out.

12:55.317 --> 12:57.277
It's all right.
Let's just all get out for a moment.

12:58.028 --> 13:00.405
I think the doctor needs a lesson
in doing what he's told.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.209
What's the problem?

13:12.292 --> 13:13.710
Open the back.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.215
Oh, no.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.051
What? No. No.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.723
- How did this happen?
- I have no idea.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.810
He's your man. Deal with him.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.102
Of course.

13:31.853 --> 13:32.896
No. No!

13:37.150 --> 13:38.527
Now...

13:38.610 --> 13:43.156
I'm hot, I got sand in my shorts,
and I want to go home.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.700
Get back in the car. Shut your mouth.

13:46.868 --> 13:49.120
I'll send some guys back.
They can't have gotten far.

13:49.204 --> 13:51.414
It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.999
Why are you still there?

13:53.625 --> 13:55.085
Let's go. Back, back, back.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.503
Come on!

14:03.718 --> 14:04.886
Miss Carter?

14:06.680 --> 14:08.807
- Miss Carter, we must rest.
- No, keep moving.

14:09.266 --> 14:11.560
Towards what?
We're miles from any sort of structure.

14:11.643 --> 14:12.727
A car will come.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.187
We haven't seen a soul in an hour.

14:14.271 --> 14:16.898
Mr Jarvis, allow me to clarify
that in the future,

14:16.982 --> 14:20.026
your opinion on how we proceed
is neither wanted nor required.

14:20.110 --> 14:21.194
I should've left you at home,

14:21.278 --> 14:22.821
but I trusted that
you would know how to behave.

14:22.904 --> 14:24.030
A mistake I won't make again.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.449
No.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.451
No, not when there are so many
other mistakes you could make.

14:28.535 --> 14:29.578
What?

14:29.661 --> 14:31.496
I will not apologise
for doing the right thing.

14:31.580 --> 14:32.706
The right thing?

14:32.789 --> 14:34.124
What you did was reckless and selfish.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.543
You risked all of our lives
for a personal vendetta.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.713
Which is not unlike you risking our lives
to fetch a Russian assassin.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.798
You saved Dottie Underwood
to assuage your conscience,

14:41.882 --> 14:43.800
and my wife, Ana, paid the price!

14:43.884 --> 14:45.176
Leaving Dottie with Whitney Frost

14:45.260 --> 14:46.469
would've been tantamount to murder,

14:46.553 --> 14:49.222
and unlike you,
I'm not a murderer, Mr Jarvis!

14:49.306 --> 14:51.641
And yet everyone around you dies.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.396
I'm sorry. I...

14:56.479 --> 14:57.731
I know I shouldn't have said that.

15:03.612 --> 15:05.405
No, no. I'm glad you did.

15:11.912 --> 15:15.081
You have begged me
to bring you on my adventures

15:15.165 --> 15:16.958
since I arrived in Los Angeles,

15:17.584 --> 15:19.377
and that's what they are to you,

15:19.461 --> 15:22.923
larks, an enjoyable way
to spend the evening.

15:25.342 --> 15:28.970
And then you go home
to another man's mansion,

15:29.554 --> 15:31.681
listening to your radio shows,

15:32.349 --> 15:35.393
blissful in your self-imposed ignorance.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.357
And when there is a consequence...

15:41.066 --> 15:44.027
A horrid, ugly consequence,

15:44.903 --> 15:47.697
you blame me for the choices
that you have made.

15:50.492 --> 15:53.244
Yes, Mr Jarvis, there is a cost.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.623
One that I have paid for 100 times over.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.628
Your... Your wife will survive.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.757
You can go on in your life
knowing nothing of loss.

16:08.927 --> 16:10.387
Lucky you.

16:15.433 --> 16:18.353
I would move
instead of sulking, Mr Jarvis.

16:18.937 --> 16:21.773
The moment we escape this desert,
we can escape each other forever.

16:22.607 --> 16:23.984
She can't have children.

16:25.944 --> 16:27.320
What?

16:30.281 --> 16:31.574
Ana.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.661
Her injuries. There were complications.

16:38.123 --> 16:40.125
Mr Jarvis, I'm so sorry.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.713
The things I said, I didn't...
I didn't know.

16:48.091 --> 16:49.467
How could you know?

16:50.719 --> 16:51.845
Nobody knows.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.392
Even Ana doesn't know.

16:59.602 --> 17:04.190
Because she is married to a coward
who can't bring himself to tell her.

17:07.902 --> 17:11.906
It's not an excuse,
because what I did is inexcusable.

17:14.909 --> 17:17.454
But I'm truly sorry.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.419
There's no need
for any of that, Mr Jarvis.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.973
And apparently, there isn't time.

17:46.191 --> 17:47.525
Miss Carter?

17:48.359 --> 17:51.321
Miss Carter?
Miss Carter, are you all right?

17:52.322 --> 17:53.364
Miss Carter?

17:54.824 --> 17:57.243
- Hey, don't move.
- What happened to her?

17:57.327 --> 17:59.329
She just collapsed.
I believe the sun has done her in.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.539
Take this one around back
and load him in.

18:01.623 --> 18:02.665
I'll get her.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.292
Come on. Let's go.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.627
She needs medical attention.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.879
Oh, she's gonna be getting
plenty of medical attention

18:07.962 --> 18:09.255
when we get back to the city.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.300
All right, Princess, your chariot awaits.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.560
I'll be keeping you two company
this time around.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.397
Oh, crap.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.025
"Oh, crap," indeed.

18:33.321 --> 18:34.405
Sip wisely.

18:34.489 --> 18:37.659
You can follow the sun to the beach.
Thanks for the motor.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.953
What's your plan, Miss Carter?
Where do we go next?

18:40.036 --> 18:41.204
I don't think we'll catch Whitney Frost...

18:41.287 --> 18:44.040
No, Mr Jarvis,
you need to be with your wife.

19:00.098 --> 19:03.143
Agent Vega, would you care to explain

19:03.226 --> 19:06.354
why these men
are not in a shallow grave

19:06.437 --> 19:07.897
back in the desert?

19:08.648 --> 19:11.317
We were acting
under Chief Thompson's orders, sir.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.574
Is that a fact?

19:17.657 --> 19:19.826
That device you have in your lockup,

19:20.952 --> 19:24.372
the one that shut down that rift,
it's called a gamma cannon.

19:24.622 --> 19:26.875
- These two can repair it.
- The hell we will.

19:26.958 --> 19:29.586
Shh! Let's hear the man out.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.338
I believe that
Whitney Frost is quite capable

19:32.422 --> 19:35.049
of figuring out a way
to fix that contraption.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.551
Probably.

19:37.093 --> 19:39.804
But then you won't be able
to use it on her.

19:44.559 --> 19:45.852
Give us the room.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.857
All right, I'm listening.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.817
We fix the cannon,

19:53.902 --> 19:56.112
we bring Frost the cannon,

19:56.196 --> 19:59.324
and then we fire it
at her pretty, blonde head

19:59.407 --> 20:00.825
and restore some order.

20:05.288 --> 20:07.707
What about Andy Hardy over here?

20:07.790 --> 20:10.460
Is he gonna be willing
to fall in line with this scheme?

20:10.543 --> 20:12.670
How do I know he won't come after me?

20:13.630 --> 20:16.716
With what? He's got nothing on you.

20:16.799 --> 20:19.761
And even a jerk on his high horse
can come off it

20:19.844 --> 20:20.970
when his career's on the line.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.599
He likes being the boss.

20:24.682 --> 20:25.767
Don't you, Sousa?

20:28.102 --> 20:31.189
Whitney Frost is too dangerous
to have running around.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.566
We take her down, I'll stay quiet.

20:35.026 --> 20:37.737
Hi. I'm Dr Samberly.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.782
I... I just want you to know
you can absolutely count on me, sir.

20:40.865 --> 20:43.993
I'm on your side 110%.

20:46.663 --> 20:48.331
Look, Vernon...

20:49.582 --> 20:52.919
Either way, I'm with you.

20:54.003 --> 20:56.047
We can deal with Frost,

20:56.130 --> 20:57.340
or you say the word.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.302
I'll take care of these guys myself.

21:09.018 --> 21:11.271
Okay, we'll do it your way, Jack.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.773
That's the smart plan.

21:20.363 --> 21:22.699
Congratulations, boys.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.785
Now get to work.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.454
Thank you, sir!

21:28.955 --> 21:30.581
We won't let you down.

21:36.713 --> 21:38.381
Well, that went as well
as can be expected.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.633
Still not sure why you had to
punch me back there in the desert.

21:41.426 --> 21:44.220
- I had to sell it, Sousa.
- Yeah.

21:47.265 --> 21:50.059
- It's not much.
- It's a dump.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.562
Waste management facility.

21:55.189 --> 21:56.858
No, I... I know. It's...

21:56.941 --> 21:59.027
I just thought it would be
a good, out-of-the-way spot,

21:59.110 --> 22:01.446
you know, but it's...
It's dirty and grimy

22:01.529 --> 22:04.032
and absolutely beneath a lady
like yourself.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.450
Joseph...

22:06.576 --> 22:07.952
It's perfect.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.914
Thank you.

22:13.916 --> 22:16.711
I had my boys fix up the place
the best they could.

22:16.794 --> 22:18.755
You know, make it like a...
Like a real lab.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.715
And did they recover
the equipment from Isodyne?

22:20.798 --> 22:22.508
Brought it in 20 minutes ago.

22:23.384 --> 22:26.220
Well, it's not as sterile
as a proper laboratory,

22:26.304 --> 22:28.848
but I suppose we can improvise.

22:30.141 --> 22:32.143
Isn't that right, Dr Wilkes?

22:33.019 --> 22:34.896
Please listen to me.

22:35.605 --> 22:36.898
You have to take me out of here,

22:36.981 --> 22:38.858
back to the desert, anywhere isolated.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.943
I think we're a little past that point,
don't you?

22:42.695 --> 22:45.782
I'm not safe. I can't hold on.

22:46.199 --> 22:47.784
I can't fight it much longer.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.160
You don't have to fight it.

22:49.911 --> 22:52.789
Do you realise
how ungrateful you sound?

22:52.872 --> 22:55.083
Others would kill for Zero Matter.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.293
Some people have killed for it.

22:57.377 --> 22:58.628
And you just want to stuff it down?

22:58.711 --> 23:00.046
I need to get rid of it.

23:00.129 --> 23:03.591
That is what I'm attempting to do,
is take it from you.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.845
I do feel as though I should apologise

23:07.929 --> 23:09.055
for what's about to happen.

23:10.681 --> 23:12.058
But you and I both know

23:12.141 --> 23:14.102
that pain is often
the harbinger of progress.

23:15.853 --> 23:16.938
Let's begin.

23:36.999 --> 23:39.085
As soon as possible.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.464
Ah, Agent Carter.

23:43.548 --> 23:45.174
You are one resilient...

23:48.511 --> 23:50.638
- Carter!
- Where are they?

23:51.139 --> 23:52.432
What have you done with Chief Sousa?

23:53.141 --> 23:54.684
Where is Chief Thompson?

23:55.184 --> 23:56.853
Peggy, Peggy, Peggy. Stop.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.938
Hey. Easy, easy, easy.

23:59.021 --> 24:01.357
What? I thought...

24:01.441 --> 24:03.109
Are you insane?

24:03.192 --> 24:05.945
Yeah, what are you thinking, Carter?
We can't kill Vernon.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.698
He's an integral part of this operation.

24:16.664 --> 24:18.541
This is ludicrous.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.418
Have a little faith.

24:20.501 --> 24:22.044
My man, Samberly,
can patch this thing right up.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.671
I'm not referring to the cannon,

24:23.754 --> 24:25.840
and I have every ounce of faith
in Dr Samberly's talent.

24:26.549 --> 24:28.968
Hey, thanks, Carter.
Nice to hear that once in a while.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.221
What I'm speaking about is this man.

24:32.472 --> 24:33.514
I don't know about you,

24:33.598 --> 24:35.725
but I'm not in the habit
of climbing into bed with snakes.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.060
I couldn't care less
who you're climbing into bed with.

24:39.395 --> 24:40.730
Let's say this works.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.608
We fix this device and then
Vernon stops Whitney Frost with it.

24:43.691 --> 24:44.859
Then what?

24:44.942 --> 24:46.819
How do you think
his priorities will change?

24:46.903 --> 24:48.404
He'll be after us the very next second.

24:48.488 --> 24:51.699
I know you'll have a hard time
believing this, Agent Carter,

24:51.782 --> 24:53.743
but I have no interest in you.

24:53.951 --> 24:57.872
I won't kill you because I don't have to.

24:57.955 --> 24:59.373
And what's that supposed to mean?

24:59.457 --> 25:01.542
What he means is
we all have dirt on one another.

25:01.626 --> 25:05.671
Bottom line is, if any one of you
tries to take me down,

25:05.755 --> 25:07.006
I take you with me.

25:07.590 --> 25:11.135
A council calls
this particular situation a stalemate,

25:11.219 --> 25:13.304
and the only way out of a stalemate

25:13.888 --> 25:15.014
is together.

25:16.724 --> 25:18.017
I'm comfortable with that.

25:18.601 --> 25:19.769
Are you?

25:19.852 --> 25:21.979
Our job is keeping people safe.

25:22.063 --> 25:23.856
If that means using Vernon
to take down a lady

25:23.940 --> 25:25.733
who kills people with black spacegoop,

25:25.816 --> 25:27.485
that's what's got to happen.

25:29.570 --> 25:30.863
What's it gonna be, Carter?

25:31.239 --> 25:33.032
Ah, she's a smart girl.

25:33.950 --> 25:35.034
She's gonna play ball.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.203
What do I have to do?

25:37.286 --> 25:38.412
You and I are backup.

25:38.496 --> 25:40.289
We keep our distance,
help with extraction if needed.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.750
When the hell we gonna go this?

25:42.833 --> 25:45.211
I've got Frost breathing
down my neck about this thing.

25:45.294 --> 25:46.379
Samberly?

25:46.462 --> 25:48.297
- I need at least another hour.
- That's not gonna fly.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.216
She wanted it over an hour ago.

25:50.299 --> 25:51.884
Can't you talk to her,
buy us some more time?

25:51.968 --> 25:53.970
She's gonna want to hear
that kind of news in person.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.263
I'll go.

25:56.806 --> 25:57.974
What?

25:58.432 --> 26:01.185
Wouldn't be the first time
I sold a load of bull to a lady.

26:06.732 --> 26:09.068
- Anything?
- Not a drop.

26:12.780 --> 26:14.907
Maybe you should give him a rest.

26:14.991 --> 26:16.867
You mess with someone this long,

26:16.951 --> 26:19.412
his heart's gonna give out
before you get what you need.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.664
I'm not shaking him down
for cash, Joseph.

26:21.747 --> 26:24.917
I'm just saying,
the guy's been put through the ringer.

26:27.545 --> 26:29.130
Fine.

26:29.213 --> 26:30.464
Fine. Kill the machine.

26:33.634 --> 26:35.595
I am at my wit's end with you, Doctor.

26:35.678 --> 26:36.804
Scalpels, needles...

26:36.887 --> 26:38.055
Nothing pulls this out of you,

26:38.139 --> 26:40.308
and I know you could give it to me
if you choose.

26:41.475 --> 26:43.102
It will kill you.

26:43.185 --> 26:44.854
Let me be the judge of that.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.148
Miss Frost? Someone here to see you.

26:47.857 --> 26:49.025
Mr Masters.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.735
One of his boys.

26:54.572 --> 26:57.241
Hmm. I know you.

26:57.325 --> 26:59.869
- We met at your husband's fundraiser.
- Yes.

27:02.163 --> 27:04.165
- Jack Thompson.
- Jack.

27:05.708 --> 27:08.169
So, Vernon sent you
to deliver the weapon, hmm?

27:09.754 --> 27:11.380
Not exactly.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.341
So he sent you to deliver bad news.

27:14.175 --> 27:15.509
Wise man, Vernon.

27:15.593 --> 27:17.553
Actually, I volunteered.

27:18.179 --> 27:20.181
- Brave.
- Stupid.

27:20.723 --> 27:22.266
Little bit of both.

27:23.100 --> 27:26.646
Hard to pass up an opportunity
to spend time with the Whitney Frost,

27:27.104 --> 27:28.439
even if it's in a dump.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.817
- Waste management facility.
- Oh, Joseph, relax.

27:31.901 --> 27:34.362
Yeah, Joseph, relax.

27:34.445 --> 27:36.656
You know what I do to guys like you?

27:36.739 --> 27:38.824
Hardly the time for this, Joseph.

27:46.582 --> 27:49.001
You know what? I'm hungry.

27:49.085 --> 27:52.338
I'm gonna go grab some supper,
and then I'm gonna head home.

27:52.421 --> 27:54.840
- You can deal with this guy yourself.
- Yep. Mmm-hmm.

27:55.466 --> 27:57.510
Let's go.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.554
Move it. Move it. Move it!

28:01.389 --> 28:04.016
Don't hold the door open for me.
I'm not a woman.

28:04.684 --> 28:07.436
- Uh, he means well.
- Of course he does.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.022
He's just jealous. I would be, too.

28:10.106 --> 28:12.775
Where's my cannon, Chief Thompson?

28:15.569 --> 28:16.946
It's at the SSR

28:17.697 --> 28:19.240
undergoing repairs.

28:19.699 --> 28:22.785
I'm here to buy a little more time
to finish up.

28:22.868 --> 28:25.121
Vernon insists
on having it up and running

28:25.204 --> 28:26.288
before we deliver it.

28:27.164 --> 28:30.376
- To impress me.
- To ruin you.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.212
He plans to use
the gamma cannon on you,

28:33.295 --> 28:34.797
put things back the way they were.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.344
But...

28:41.220 --> 28:44.223
- I have another idea.
- Do you?

28:44.306 --> 28:46.475
I deliver the cannon to you,

28:46.559 --> 28:50.062
along with Vernon Masters
to do with as you please.

28:51.272 --> 28:54.525
So this is why you volunteered
to come here today.

28:54.608 --> 28:56.235
You want Vernon's job.

28:56.569 --> 28:58.112
No.

28:58.195 --> 28:59.405
I want more.

29:03.325 --> 29:05.202
I want a seat on the Council.

29:12.460 --> 29:13.586
She bought it?

29:14.920 --> 29:16.589
She wasn't happy about it,

29:16.672 --> 29:20.050
but my blood's still on the inside,
so, yes, she bought it.

29:20.551 --> 29:22.303
Which is why
I think you're up to something.

29:22.386 --> 29:24.138
Don't worry about what I'm up to.

29:24.805 --> 29:27.183
You must have
quite the silver tongue, Jack.

29:27.641 --> 29:29.018
I got to be honest,

29:29.101 --> 29:30.603
I didn't think
you'd get out of there alive.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.938
Thought you learned
not to underestimate me, Vernon.

29:34.607 --> 29:36.442
This is the last piece.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.486
- All set?
- Just like you wanted.

29:38.569 --> 29:39.945
This is the gamma core.

29:40.029 --> 29:42.156
I cannot stress this enough...

29:42.615 --> 29:44.617
Handle with extreme caution.

29:45.201 --> 29:46.952
- Got it?
- Oh!

29:49.622 --> 29:51.957
- Who's doing the honours?
- I will.

29:52.583 --> 29:53.793
Seems only right.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.546
Red button's the trigger.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.215
That's the business end.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.967
Stay out of the line of fire
if you don't want to incinerate yourself.

30:02.051 --> 30:03.219
Be careful.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.054
Zero Matter doesn't tend to listen
to silver tongues.

30:05.930 --> 30:08.974
All right, enough hand holding.
Let's get this over with.

30:09.058 --> 30:10.643
You heard the man!

30:13.229 --> 30:14.814
I don't like this.

30:14.897 --> 30:16.190
Too many things can go wrong,

30:16.273 --> 30:18.901
not least of which
Vernon Masters turning against us all.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.402
The one thing I know we can count on

30:20.486 --> 30:22.071
is Vernon doing what's best for Vernon.

30:23.322 --> 30:26.575
And right now,
that's getting rid of Whitney Frost.

30:32.039 --> 30:33.624
Carter to Thompson.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.168
Jack, can you hear me?

30:38.379 --> 30:39.755
Damn it.

30:39.839 --> 30:41.924
- What's wrong?
- Fuel line's cut.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.050
Vernon.

30:43.133 --> 30:44.677
So I look him dead in his eye,

30:44.760 --> 30:47.263
and I say, "I don't give a damn
if you're Vernon Masters

30:47.346 --> 30:49.890
"or Harry Truman
or Tarzan of the Apes."

30:49.974 --> 30:51.684
I expect "please" and "thank you"...

30:51.767 --> 30:53.394
Samberly, we need your car. Now.

30:53.477 --> 30:55.145
- What happened?
- Vernon sabotaged us.

30:55.229 --> 30:56.397
He's setting up Chief Thompson.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.816
Oh, no. He's figured out our plan.

30:59.066 --> 31:00.109
What plan?

31:00.192 --> 31:03.028
You know, the plan? Ow!

31:03.112 --> 31:04.405
What are you talking about?
What plan?

31:04.488 --> 31:05.698
Spit it out, Aloysius.

31:06.073 --> 31:08.075
Turning the gamma cannon
into a bomb.

31:08.158 --> 31:09.577
A bomb? Who told you to do that?

31:09.660 --> 31:11.662
Chief Thompson.
He said it was your idea.

31:12.288 --> 31:14.039
- Wasn't it?
- I knew Jack was up to something.

31:14.123 --> 31:15.749
- He's gonna kill them all.
- Including Dr Wilkes.

31:15.833 --> 31:18.377
But that's okay, right? He's evil now.

31:18.460 --> 31:19.795
When will the bomb go off?

31:19.879 --> 31:22.089
It's on a remote trigger.
Thompson will blow it once he's clear.

31:22.172 --> 31:24.091
What the hell is wrong with him?
Why wouldn't he tell us this?

31:24.174 --> 31:26.468
The remote trigger you designed,
it's on a radio frequency, correct?

31:26.552 --> 31:27.720
- Yes.
- Which means you can block it.

31:27.803 --> 31:29.805
I'd have to build a jammer
to send out an EM wave.

31:29.889 --> 31:30.931
Can you build it in three minutes?

31:31.015 --> 31:32.933
What am I, an amateur?
I can build it in two.

31:33.017 --> 31:34.101
Well, then, go.

31:36.770 --> 31:37.897
<i>Lean forward.</i>

31:37.980 --> 31:39.356
A little more. A little more.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.650
- Stop fussing, Edwin.
- It's uneven.

31:41.734 --> 31:43.402
Restricted blood flow
hinders the healing process.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.070
Let it be.

31:45.154 --> 31:46.572
Now, where's Miss Carter?

31:48.032 --> 31:49.742
Has she located Whitney Frost?

31:49.825 --> 31:51.619
The case is almost over.
It's going very well.

31:51.702 --> 31:53.829
Now, on to more important matters.

31:54.663 --> 31:56.248
Upon your discharge,

31:56.332 --> 31:58.083
I was thinking that you and I

31:58.167 --> 31:59.919
might motor up
the Pacific Coast Highway.

32:00.002 --> 32:02.129
But what of Dr Wilkes? Is he safe?

32:03.297 --> 32:04.715
I'm sure he will be soon.

32:05.299 --> 32:07.259
It's been too long
since you and I have had a holiday,

32:07.885 --> 32:09.678
and I've heard that
Santa Barbara is very quaint.

32:09.762 --> 32:13.015
Mr Jarvis, you detest going on holiday.

32:16.727 --> 32:18.187
And you're not being truthful.

32:18.812 --> 32:20.481
But I am being honest.

32:23.817 --> 32:25.361
Tea?

32:28.989 --> 32:30.366
Dr Wilkes was last seen
with Miss Frost.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.660
He'd been exposed to an
extraordinary amount of Zero Matter.

32:32.743 --> 32:34.453
I do not know if he survived.

32:35.079 --> 32:37.665
Oh, dear. And Miss Carter?

32:37.748 --> 32:39.249
She's trying to get him back,

32:39.333 --> 32:42.544
but Miss Frost is formidable.

32:42.628 --> 32:45.881
Edwin, what are you doing here?
You should be helping Miss Carter.

32:47.257 --> 32:48.550
I am here

32:50.177 --> 32:52.179
because you need me.

32:52.262 --> 32:53.722
And that's lovely,

32:53.806 --> 32:56.475
but there's a legion
of doctors and nurses for me here.

32:57.601 --> 32:59.228
Who does Peggy have?

32:59.812 --> 33:00.854
Only you.

33:03.065 --> 33:05.693
- But...
- I will not debate this with you, Edwin.

33:07.319 --> 33:10.155
You must try and render
any assistance you can.

33:12.992 --> 33:15.077
Very well. I shall.

33:17.287 --> 33:18.455
Now,

33:19.248 --> 33:20.749
what else are you not telling me?

33:23.544 --> 33:26.422
It does you no good to protect me
from the truth, Edwin.

33:27.798 --> 33:30.217
You're a terrible liar.

33:33.262 --> 33:34.596
You know me too well, darling.

33:50.654 --> 33:51.989
They've got the cannon.

33:52.865 --> 33:54.408
I'm going in to retrieve Wilkes.

33:54.491 --> 33:55.576
Are you nuts?

33:55.659 --> 33:56.910
If the bomb goes off,
you'll be dead, too.

33:56.994 --> 33:58.037
We're out of time.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.288
Samberly will get this working.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.123
- It's not working.
- Why the hell not?

34:01.206 --> 34:03.542
- I only had two minutes to build it.
- You said that was enough!

34:03.625 --> 34:06.253
Yelling won't make it work, Chief Sousa.

34:07.337 --> 34:08.797
Where'd Agent Carter go?

34:29.777 --> 34:31.278
And what's the target range?

34:31.904 --> 34:34.740
Well, Sousa was a half mile away
from the rift when he hit it.

34:35.199 --> 34:38.368
Only limitation is it needs
a new charge after each use.

34:39.161 --> 34:41.580
That's all right.
I only plan to use it once.

34:41.663 --> 34:43.332
On what?

34:43.415 --> 34:45.876
Dr Wilkes has my Zero Matter.

34:46.585 --> 34:47.711
I'm taking it back.

34:49.129 --> 34:51.131
Allow me to show you how it works.

34:51.965 --> 34:53.258
Aren't you kind?

35:03.435 --> 35:06.105
The one thing we don't
know is how it works on a person.

35:06.271 --> 35:08.690
It's only been tested on the rift.
It's possible...

35:09.441 --> 35:11.527
Well, that doesn't
really matter, does it?

35:32.089 --> 35:33.549
It's all right. It's me.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.801
Peggy? What are you doing?

35:36.218 --> 35:37.302
Getting you out of here.

35:38.178 --> 35:39.388
Peggy, you need to leave.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.265
We both do.
There's a bomb set to go off

35:41.348 --> 35:42.975
as soon as
Chief Thompson leaves the building.

35:43.058 --> 35:44.226
Do you think you can walk?

35:44.309 --> 35:46.270
No. Please.

35:46.645 --> 35:47.813
Dear Lord. Jason.

35:48.230 --> 35:50.816
I can't hold it back much longer.
Get out of here.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.693
We can help you.
The device that Howard built...

35:52.776 --> 35:55.654
Save yourself, Peggy.
I don't deserve your help.

35:55.737 --> 35:57.197
You were under the influence
of Zero Matter.

35:57.322 --> 36:00.159
You are a good man. Remember that.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.328
The things I did...

36:03.412 --> 36:05.038
All of it was of my own volition.

36:05.789 --> 36:07.166
That wasn't Zero Matter.

36:07.875 --> 36:09.042
That was me.

36:11.253 --> 36:14.756
I should show you
one other pertinent feature.

36:15.382 --> 36:17.009
No.

36:17.092 --> 36:19.595
I think I understand everything...

36:21.471 --> 36:23.015
Perfectly.

36:23.932 --> 36:25.100
I must say,

36:25.184 --> 36:27.561
I almost didn't believe
Chief Thompson.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.355
I really thought
you were smarter than this, Vernon.

36:31.732 --> 36:34.234
- What do you mean?
- I'm sorry, Vernon.

36:37.529 --> 36:38.739
Change of plans.

36:41.825 --> 36:45.996
Oh, Jackie, I didn't think
you had it in you.

36:48.248 --> 36:50.417
- I'm begging you, Peggy. Go.
- No.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.377
And the longer we argue about it,
the more danger we're in.

36:52.461 --> 36:54.588
Something's happening to me,
something cataclysmic.

36:54.671 --> 36:55.923
At least here, no one else will get hurt.

36:56.006 --> 36:57.591
I'm not leaving without you.

37:00.719 --> 37:03.472
- You're very stubborn.
- My brother would agree.

37:11.605 --> 37:12.648
Jason!

37:13.607 --> 37:15.776
- Jason, open this door.
- It's okay.

37:16.485 --> 37:17.903
I'm ready for this to be over.

37:17.986 --> 37:19.780
No! No, we can help you!

37:19.863 --> 37:21.240
You already have.

37:23.033 --> 37:24.409
Go.

37:43.428 --> 37:45.347
- Well?
- Hold on.

37:45.430 --> 37:46.890
That's it. I got it.

37:46.974 --> 37:48.183
The detonator's now blocked.

37:48.809 --> 37:50.185
Finally.

37:50.269 --> 37:53.480
"Hey, great job, Doctor.
You really saved the day."

37:53.563 --> 37:55.399
Samberly, I'm gonna kill you someday.

37:55.482 --> 37:56.692
Get in line, Chief.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.318
Where the hell are you, Peggy?

38:00.612 --> 38:02.781
You're making a big mistake, Jack.

38:02.864 --> 38:05.075
I've made plenty, Vernon.

38:05.158 --> 38:06.326
This isn't one of them.

38:06.410 --> 38:08.203
There's still a way to fix this.

38:08.287 --> 38:10.872
You and I can both walk out of this.

38:10.956 --> 38:12.874
We wouldn't have to answer
to anybody.

38:12.958 --> 38:14.626
Oh, please. Don't fib.

38:15.043 --> 38:16.253
All you do all day long

38:16.336 --> 38:18.672
is answer to men
more powerful than you.

38:18.755 --> 38:21.049
You can't trust her, Jack. You know that.

38:21.133 --> 38:22.884
I owe you a lot, Vernon.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.970
You've been like a second father to me.

38:25.053 --> 38:26.096
I want you to know

38:26.179 --> 38:28.807
I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

38:28.890 --> 38:30.267
Yeah, I can tell.

38:30.726 --> 38:34.104
The biggest lesson I've learned

38:34.187 --> 38:37.232
is never let a good opportunity
pass you by.

38:37.316 --> 38:39.401
You're doing that now!

38:39.901 --> 38:41.236
Sorry it has to end like this.

38:43.030 --> 38:44.906
Do you want to do the honours,
Chief Thompson?

38:45.615 --> 38:46.908
No.

38:47.701 --> 38:50.037
From what I hear,
your way is a lot cleaner.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.913
Don't do this, Jack.

38:52.748 --> 38:55.000
Let me know when you've gotten
what you need from Wilkes.

38:55.083 --> 38:56.335
We have a lot to talk about.

38:57.836 --> 39:00.047
I'm very much looking forward to it.

39:01.423 --> 39:02.507
Jack.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.761
Jack! Jack!

39:37.501 --> 39:38.585
Carter.

39:40.420 --> 39:42.547
Jack, what the hell are you doing?

39:42.631 --> 39:44.132
Turn it on. Turn it on now!

39:44.216 --> 39:45.634
You want us to trust you,
then you pull this crap?

39:45.717 --> 39:47.677
This isn't about trust.
This is about making the hard choices.

39:47.761 --> 39:50.680
- By killing an innocent person?
- Not one person in there is innocent!

39:50.764 --> 39:51.890
Jason Wilkes is.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.642
I'm doing what needs to be done,

39:53.725 --> 39:55.227
what the two of you won't do.

39:55.310 --> 39:56.478
Murder three people?

39:56.561 --> 39:58.939
Vernon would've killed all of us
the first chance he got!

39:59.022 --> 40:00.732
Vernon Masters
should be brought to justice.

40:00.816 --> 40:01.983
Isn't that our job?

40:02.067 --> 40:03.610
Or is the SSR
no longer in that business?

40:03.693 --> 40:05.070
Well, it doesn't matter now.

40:05.153 --> 40:07.072
Whitney's taking care of him
as we speak,

40:07.447 --> 40:09.408
with or without the bomb,

40:09.491 --> 40:10.992
and nobody is gonna shed a tear

40:11.076 --> 40:12.953
if we blow Whitney Frost
to kingdom come.

40:13.036 --> 40:16.164
And how does killing Wilkes
fit into your moral prevarication?

40:16.248 --> 40:18.417
Because he's more dangerous
than all of them put together!

40:18.500 --> 40:21.211
Samberly, whatever you did
to the detonator, undo it.

40:21.294 --> 40:23.130
Jack, forget about it. This is over.

40:24.339 --> 40:26.425
Fix it.

40:26.508 --> 40:27.676
- No!
- No!

40:28.051 --> 40:30.011
Fixed.

40:36.059 --> 40:37.185
Put it down.

40:44.192 --> 40:45.944
That boy can't help you, Whitney.

40:46.027 --> 40:47.320
He hasn't got the juice.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.114
I've got the connections.

40:49.197 --> 40:50.782
Your connections
are gonna find themselves

40:50.866 --> 40:52.451
facing a similar fate, Vernon.

40:53.160 --> 40:55.454
I'm remaking the world in my image,

40:55.537 --> 40:56.872
and I'm starting with you.

41:00.167 --> 41:01.334
Why are you smiling?

41:02.377 --> 41:04.713
Because they got you, too, bitch.

41:07.257 --> 41:08.633
No!

41:08.717 --> 41:10.510
No!

41:15.015 --> 41:16.057
No!

41:17.392 --> 41:18.518
No, Dr Wilkes, you can't...
