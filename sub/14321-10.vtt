00:01.708 --> 00:03.083
[narrator]
Previously on X-Men...

00:03.083 --> 00:04.625
What have you done
with my wife?

00:04.625 --> 00:08.500
Mrs. Summers is just another
broken blossom,

00:08.500 --> 00:11.833
floating through
the winds of time.

00:11.833 --> 00:14.708
They've taken Jean
to the one place
you can't get to.

00:14.708 --> 00:16.291
And where is here?

00:16.291 --> 00:21.750
Here is the Axis of Time,
where all times cross.

00:21.750 --> 00:25.000
[Xavier] Mr. Sinister tried
to capture both of us.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.291
Now Apocalypse has taken
the Shi'ar courtier
known as Oracle.

00:29.291 --> 00:32.458
If Apocalypse and Sinister
have joined forces,

00:32.458 --> 00:34.750
all existence is in danger.

00:34.750 --> 00:38.583
We'll use Cerebro
to track down other mutants
with psychic powers.

00:38.583 --> 00:41.958
And we'll be there
when Apocalypse
or Sinister strikes.

00:41.958 --> 00:43.458
Guess again!

00:43.458 --> 00:44.958
May I help?

00:44.958 --> 00:46.083
Magneto.

00:46.083 --> 00:48.250
What do you want with me?

00:48.250 --> 00:49.833
Don't worry.

00:49.833 --> 00:52.458
No harm will come
to you yet.

00:52.458 --> 00:54.583
What happened?
Where are the others?

00:54.583 --> 00:56.875
We messed up.
Psylocke's gone.

00:56.875 --> 01:00.208
I bet this clown knows
what's going on.

01:00.208 --> 01:05.000
It seems that Charles Xavier
has deduced the pattern
of my plan.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
All the better
as he will be
my final prize.

01:11.416 --> 01:15.583
[Cable] I wanted to nail
Apocalypse by destroying
his Lazarus Chamber.

01:15.583 --> 01:17.500
Our only hope
is to go so far back

01:17.500 --> 01:20.416
that we get rid of the chamber
at its point of origin.

01:20.416 --> 01:22.625
The government
still has a time machine?

01:22.625 --> 01:25.958
It's in there.
And we're gonna borrow it.

01:25.958 --> 01:29.458
[theme music playing]

02:31.083 --> 02:33.583
-[Bender stuttering] Guess who?
-Not again!

02:33.583 --> 02:36.375
And again, and again, and again
and again and again.

02:36.375 --> 02:37.583
[laughing]

02:38.625 --> 02:42.583
Look, clown, I've had
a long day, or week,
or however long it's been.

02:42.583 --> 02:45.000
All walk and no play
makes Bishop a dull boy.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.458
[both gasping]

02:49.500 --> 02:50.583
What was that?

02:51.125 --> 02:53.208
[Bender] A great being
threatens time itself.

02:54.125 --> 02:55.375
[buzzing]

02:55.375 --> 02:56.708
Knowledge is power.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.958
[Bender] Let's watch
these guys. [giggles]

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
[Bishop] That's Cable.

03:04.583 --> 03:06.583
It will be. It would be.

03:06.583 --> 03:08.708
It can be, it could be,
and maybe it should be.

03:08.708 --> 03:10.166
[laughing] Can we be?

03:20.708 --> 03:21.708
Ready, Dad?

03:22.208 --> 03:25.000
Yeah, kid. Start the ball.

03:25.708 --> 03:26.708
Okay, guys.

03:27.625 --> 03:30.708
Give us 30 seconds,
then let's lose
one power station.

03:30.708 --> 03:33.000
I wish you'd let me
go with you.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.875
I know, Tyler.
But if I don't make it,
I need you to carry on here.

03:38.708 --> 03:40.500
I know you'll make me proud.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.750
Remember, Dad,
the energy dome will only
be down for a minute.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.166
[screaming]

04:04.166 --> 04:07.166
Tyler, the dome is still up.

04:07.166 --> 04:09.000
They've run into
heavy resistance!

04:30.583 --> 04:31.583
[exclaims]

04:34.583 --> 04:36.125
What's happening?

04:36.125 --> 04:37.875
I'm not getting
any word from them.

04:37.875 --> 04:42.000
Tyler, the power station
must be destroyed.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.458
It's the only chance we have.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.291
Tyler? Are you all right?

05:27.708 --> 05:29.208
[beeping]

05:47.625 --> 05:48.625
Tyler!

05:51.083 --> 05:52.875
Dad! Get going!

05:54.166 --> 05:56.375
I'll be back for you.

06:31.875 --> 06:34.750
Take your time.
I'll be gone in a minute.

06:42.958 --> 06:44.208
[engine revving]

06:49.708 --> 06:51.583
[whooshing]

06:56.000 --> 07:00.166
Graymalkin.I hope
they kept your battery charged.

07:03.583 --> 07:05.000
[beeping]

07:25.416 --> 07:26.708
[beeping]

07:50.708 --> 07:52.125
What's happening?

07:55.500 --> 08:00.083
[Apocalypse] You yearn
to destroy my resting place
at its inception.

08:00.083 --> 08:01.875
A wise strategy.

08:01.875 --> 08:05.458
But first, you have
a service to perform.

08:10.291 --> 08:11.583
[engine whirring]

08:26.416 --> 08:27.958
What am I doing here?

08:27.958 --> 08:30.458
I was about to ask you
the very same thing.

08:32.166 --> 08:35.166
I don't care about
missing psychics
and time jolts.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.416
I'm after Apocalypse.

08:37.416 --> 08:41.416
Look. Apocalypse was involved
in at least one
of the kidnappings.

08:41.416 --> 08:44.875
My guess
is that our interests coincide.

08:44.875 --> 08:46.875
You're boring me.

08:46.875 --> 08:49.583
If you want
to help me nail him,
get your team together,

08:49.583 --> 08:51.250
and let's get started.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.708
[Beast] It is conceivable
that a powerful force
traveling through time

08:55.708 --> 08:58.708
creates a backwash,
a kind of wake,

08:58.708 --> 09:01.583
that disrupts the paths
of normal time travelers.

09:01.583 --> 09:05.833
It's just a theory.
You have no evidence
this happened to my brother.

09:05.833 --> 09:09.500
Bishop's disappearance in time
fits the computer model
perfectly.

09:09.500 --> 09:13.583
Note the effect
of the more powerful
time traveler on the first.

09:20.416 --> 09:22.875
You're too stupid
to plan this on your own.

09:22.875 --> 09:24.458
Who are you working for?

09:24.458 --> 09:27.333
Suck rocks, pretty boy.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.875
[growls]

09:28.875 --> 09:31.166
The Professor wants you
in the War Room.

09:31.166 --> 09:34.333
Why not?
I'm just wasting my time here.

09:34.333 --> 09:35.833
[growling]

09:40.875 --> 09:42.000
[smashing]

09:42.000 --> 09:46.083
Okay, hairball. Let's talk.

09:46.083 --> 09:47.291
[screaming]

09:52.583 --> 09:55.250
[Cable] It's called
the Lazarus Chamber.

09:55.250 --> 09:59.583
I discovered it,
will discover it,
2,000 years from now.

10:00.708 --> 10:03.458
It's the secret
to Apocalypse's longevity.

10:04.625 --> 10:08.708
He goes into hibernation there
every 100 years.

10:11.625 --> 10:13.875
[Archangel] So that's it!

10:13.875 --> 10:17.458
All my research pointed to
periodic dormant times
for Apocalypse.

10:17.458 --> 10:19.625
But I could never discover
why or where.

10:19.625 --> 10:24.166
I destroyed the chamber
in my time, in 3999.

10:24.166 --> 10:28.000
But before I did,
Apocalypse grabbed
my time travel device.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.333
Now he can just return
to any time

10:30.333 --> 10:33.750
before the chamber
was destroyed
to rejuvenate himself.

10:33.750 --> 10:38.208
I'm going back to when
the pyramid was first built
and get rid of it then.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.416
-Let's do it.
-Wait a minute.

10:40.416 --> 10:42.708
What about Sinister
and the missing psychics?

10:42.708 --> 10:45.000
Find someone who cares.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.708
I left my son back there
so I could get at Apocalypse.

10:48.708 --> 10:50.875
I may never see Tyler again.

10:50.875 --> 10:53.458
There's more to this
than just him.

10:53.458 --> 10:55.375
[Wolverine] No, there isn't.

10:55.375 --> 10:58.958
Sabretooth's working
for the guy.
Everybody might be.

10:58.958 --> 11:01.458
I understood
that he had refused to talk.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.125
He changed his mind.

11:03.125 --> 11:05.125
[groans]

11:05.125 --> 11:08.458
What else did he say?
Pieces to the puzzle
don't fit.

11:08.458 --> 11:12.458
Why on earth would Magneto
be involved with Apocalypse?

11:12.458 --> 11:14.958
It took an hour to get that
out of him.

11:14.958 --> 11:17.625
You want more,
you know how to get it.

11:17.625 --> 11:21.583
I have chosen not to invade
the minds of others
without their consent.

11:21.583 --> 11:25.708
If it's important,
get it out of him.
Or I will.

11:25.708 --> 11:27.000
Very well.

11:36.500 --> 11:40.625
Cable is right.
We must stop him at all costs.

11:40.625 --> 11:42.166
What did you see?

11:42.166 --> 11:46.125
Portals. Clocks.
Time-related images.

11:46.125 --> 11:50.416
Apocalypse seems bent
on mastering time itself,

11:50.416 --> 11:54.750
and has persuaded some
of the most powerful mutants
on Earth to help him.

11:54.750 --> 11:57.458
If we take out
his life-support system,

11:57.458 --> 11:59.500
then none of this
will ever take place.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.000
[Xavier] I agree, Cable.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Shard, you, Rogue
and Jubilee stay here,

12:03.000 --> 12:05.458
in case Cable's theory
proves wrong.

12:05.458 --> 12:08.583
Why can't I go?
Don't you think
I can handle it?

12:08.583 --> 12:11.875
It's not that, Shard.
If we fail,

12:11.875 --> 12:16.958
your ability to travel
through time may be
your brother's last hope.

12:16.958 --> 12:18.583
I want to go with you.

12:18.583 --> 12:20.583
There's no room
on this mission for vengeance.

12:20.583 --> 12:24.708
I don't know.
Revenge can sure
help you focus.

12:24.708 --> 12:27.583
Not for me anymore.
I know what's at stake now.

12:44.708 --> 12:47.166
[Apocalypse]
Tiny, meddling insects.

12:47.166 --> 12:50.875
They don't realize
that he who controls time,

12:50.875 --> 12:53.416
controls every eventuality.

12:53.416 --> 12:55.708
Apocalypse. You summoned me?

12:56.500 --> 12:59.958
Yes. The endgame has begun.

13:06.708 --> 13:09.708
Whoa. Good thing they don't
serve lunch on this flight.

13:22.458 --> 13:24.750
Hey! Watch it!

13:24.750 --> 13:28.250
Billions of miles of space
and people still can't drive.

13:40.875 --> 13:43.875
[Cable] The pyramid's over
the rise, down river.

13:52.166 --> 13:56.500
Storm, take Archangel
and scout ahead to see if
the pyramid is guarded.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.250
We will follow on the ground.

14:14.458 --> 14:18.458
[Storm] Beautiful, is it not?
My parents loved this land.

14:19.458 --> 14:23.458
And though my life was hard
after they were gone,
I loved it, too.

14:24.458 --> 14:26.458
The pyramid appears
to be unguarded.

14:26.458 --> 14:28.708
Bring the others up
while I make sure.

14:29.708 --> 14:32.250
[Beast] Your timing is perfect,
Cable.

14:32.250 --> 14:36.708
Those stone blocks at the base
suggest that construction
has recently been completed.

14:36.708 --> 14:39.583
We will need a diversion
to cover our approach.

14:39.583 --> 14:41.458
You shall have it, Professor.

14:43.458 --> 14:47.208
Wind, howl and raise the sands
of the desert.

14:51.875 --> 14:56.583
Before we go in,
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about your son.

14:56.583 --> 14:59.000
I know what it's like
to lose someone you love.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.291
I haven't lost him yet.

15:02.583 --> 15:04.375
Professor, do you know
anything more about

15:04.375 --> 15:06.750
why Apocalypse
is kidnapping psychics?

15:06.750 --> 15:08.458
Who cares?

15:08.458 --> 15:11.708
He's pure evil,
and that's why he's got to go.

15:11.708 --> 15:15.458
If Apocalypse is indeed
the personification of evil,

15:15.458 --> 15:18.083
it may be impossible
to destroy him.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.458
Why?

15:19.458 --> 15:21.500
The conflict
between good and evil

15:21.500 --> 15:23.875
is part of
the fabric of existence.

15:23.875 --> 15:26.833
Perhaps the world
cannot exist without evil.

15:26.833 --> 15:31.500
If Apocalypse is destroyed,
evil may only take
another form.

15:31.500 --> 15:34.416
I'll worry about that later.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.083
The entrance is there,
behind that stone!

15:53.083 --> 15:54.166
Allow me.

15:54.166 --> 15:56.625
[grunting]

15:58.083 --> 16:00.708
Shall we see
who is at home? Whoa!

16:03.458 --> 16:05.458
[Archangel]
The Four Horsemen.

16:05.458 --> 16:08.708
Cable was right.
Apocalypse has protected
himself.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.291
[grunting]

16:24.583 --> 16:26.000
-[groans]
-[groans]

16:33.000 --> 16:34.375
[groaning]

16:40.583 --> 16:43.875
There's no use
fighting me.
I had your job once.

16:46.750 --> 16:49.458
Go get Apocalypse.
We can hold these guys here.

16:49.458 --> 16:51.083
Just be careful!

16:51.083 --> 16:53.583
Cable, Wolverine, Beast,
come with me.

17:13.875 --> 17:15.000
[Wolverine] Don't move.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.458
-What is it?
-[sniffing]

17:18.000 --> 17:19.875
Fresh tree sap?

17:19.875 --> 17:22.416
I know where all
the booby traps are.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.500
[screaming]

17:26.291 --> 17:27.458
[Xavier] Beast!

17:37.875 --> 17:40.708
Maybe next time
you'll trust my nose.

17:40.708 --> 17:44.458
Thanks. I don't know
how I missed that one before.

17:44.458 --> 17:47.458
[Beast] Apparently, Apocalypse
will make a few alterations

17:47.458 --> 17:49.208
in the next 5,000 years.

18:07.500 --> 18:11.458
They're going back in
to save the chamber.
Inside! Now!

18:13.625 --> 18:17.583
Well, you'll be here
in 5,000 years.
Which way do we go?

18:19.750 --> 18:20.958
[screaming]

18:23.958 --> 18:25.166
[growling]

18:36.125 --> 18:37.583
Hey. Where you going?

18:48.708 --> 18:51.750
I told you I knew where
the booby traps were.

18:51.750 --> 18:52.750
[groaning]

18:59.500 --> 19:03.083
It appears fighting metal
with flesh is poor tactics.

19:05.458 --> 19:07.000
That is more like it.

19:12.125 --> 19:13.291
[Wolverine] Cable, look out!

19:13.291 --> 19:14.500
[grunts]

19:16.250 --> 19:18.583
Hey, pal, leave a few
of them for us.

19:18.583 --> 19:22.000
The Lazarus Chamber.
It's in there.

19:24.125 --> 19:25.875
[Wolverine]
What's the verdict, Doc?

19:25.875 --> 19:28.250
Nothing broken.
However, I would not count on

19:28.250 --> 19:30.416
him helping much
in the next few minutes.

19:30.416 --> 19:32.333
We'll pick up Cable
on our way back.

19:32.333 --> 19:36.458
Now, let's find Apocalypse
and do what we came to do.

19:38.166 --> 19:40.250
[energy pulsating]

19:42.000 --> 19:43.583
Magnificent.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.333
The pyramid acts
as a huge energy collector

19:46.333 --> 19:49.000
to regenerate Apocalypse
as he sleeps.

19:50.416 --> 19:52.166
Wait! [sniffing]

19:52.166 --> 19:54.583
I smell two rats
in this barn.

19:54.583 --> 19:57.458
Something is wrong. It's...

19:57.458 --> 19:59.000
[laughing]

20:03.583 --> 20:05.291
Now, Apocalypse!

20:06.958 --> 20:08.416
[all screaming]

20:12.458 --> 20:13.708
Xavier?

20:14.875 --> 20:15.958
Wolverine?

20:17.416 --> 20:18.708
Cyclops!

20:22.500 --> 20:24.458
What happened?

20:34.291 --> 20:35.625
What was that?

20:35.625 --> 20:38.208
The most important move
of all.

20:38.708 --> 20:40.458
The capture of the king.

20:41.250 --> 20:43.458
Professor Charles Xavier!

20:53.583 --> 20:56.583
[theme music playing]
