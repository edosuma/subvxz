00:06.047 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:11.011 --> 00:12.512
<i>Damn it, Esteban. Pick up.</i>

00:12.595 --> 00:13.430
Jana!

00:14.222 --> 00:15.056
<i>You've reached…</i>

00:15.140 --> 00:15.974
Calm down.

00:16.558 --> 00:17.767
It was you, asshole.

00:17.851 --> 00:18.685
What?

00:18.768 --> 00:19.728
You sabotaged us.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.896
Jana, stop being so paranoid.

00:21.980 --> 00:25.275
Paranoid? You've been
screwing with us from the start.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.986
If you're accusing me,
I hope you have proof.

00:28.653 --> 00:29.904
Like your confession?

00:29.988 --> 00:33.324
The video had to be uploaded
from a school account.

00:38.204 --> 00:39.581
Who uploaded the video?

00:44.252 --> 00:45.587
I told you, Jana.

00:46.546 --> 00:49.466
Be careful who you keep close,
they'll betray you.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.642
-Did you do it?
-This again.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.978
Why don't you go ask Mr. Puebla?

01:02.604 --> 01:04.397
Oh wait, he ran away.

01:04.481 --> 01:05.815
Esteban wouldn't do that.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.151
Do you know that for a fact?

01:08.234 --> 01:11.905
Or is it because
you fell for his poor, nice guy act?

01:13.114 --> 01:15.200
We all know Esteban was never honest.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.161
But that's okay. I don't judge.

01:18.828 --> 01:20.330
We all have our secrets.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.918
Or do you still think that Dixon here

01:25.001 --> 01:27.045
is from a tough part of Bogotá?

01:27.128 --> 01:28.379
You know nothing, bro.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.925
Poor guy, he can't afford
to maintain his hair,

01:32.008 --> 01:35.136
his watch, his sneakers.

01:35.720 --> 01:36.638
Cut the shit.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.139
Look at him.

01:40.767 --> 01:41.684
What about you, Selena?

01:41.768 --> 01:43.561
The devout Christian girl,

01:43.645 --> 01:45.814
with her liberal parents in the US

01:45.897 --> 01:48.817
who sent you to Mexico
to become a pop star, really?

01:49.859 --> 01:52.529
It worked for Taylor Swift,
but she's one in a million.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.322
You know nothing about me, Luka.

01:54.405 --> 01:57.575
Maybe, but I know that Jana
brought us together for her benefit.

01:59.494 --> 02:00.578
What about you, Luka?

02:01.454 --> 02:03.706
You're here running your mouth,

02:04.582 --> 02:05.834
but you're hiding something too.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.253
I'm an open book.

02:09.337 --> 02:10.839
You have a lot of nerve.

02:11.464 --> 02:12.799
Everything I said is true.

02:13.758 --> 02:16.010
You can't get far in life being naive.

02:17.011 --> 02:18.847
I'm the only one telling the truth.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.015
We're not friends.

02:22.642 --> 02:23.768
We were pretending.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.292
My name's not Dixon.

02:49.460 --> 02:52.547
My parents are both
well-known lawyers in Colombia.

02:53.798 --> 02:57.635
They never had time for me,
so I grew up with my grandpa.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.347
He put me in a Catholic school.

03:02.223 --> 03:04.726
I wasn't exactly famous
for being a rapper.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.312
I was an altar boy.

03:09.147 --> 03:09.981
No way.

03:11.065 --> 03:12.108
Why did you lie?

03:12.609 --> 03:14.694
My dream was always to be a rapper.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.865
That's why I came to this country.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.660
But who would respect a rapper like that?

03:26.789 --> 03:29.375
I lied to my parents.

03:31.794 --> 03:34.547
They didn't want me to come to Mexico,
or EWS.

03:35.089 --> 03:37.342
So I told them

03:37.425 --> 03:41.012
that I was studying
at a religious music conservatory.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.474
They trust me a lot.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.062
Andi.

03:49.145 --> 03:50.230
What?

03:50.313 --> 03:52.482
You don't have anything to say?

03:53.608 --> 03:56.402
You're among friends,
we won't say anything.

03:57.111 --> 03:58.988
What? Emilia?

03:59.072 --> 04:00.657
-What about her?
-They're together.

04:00.740 --> 04:01.908
No.

04:01.991 --> 04:04.702
We just hooked up and that's it.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.914
-So, you're sleeping with the enemy?
-The enemy, really?

04:08.539 --> 04:09.874
-She's with Sebas.
-And?

04:10.375 --> 04:13.586
Besides, I don't have to tell
anyone what I do.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.297
But how did you find out?

04:23.346 --> 04:24.597
Your turn, Jana.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.307
Do you want to tell us anything?

04:27.558 --> 04:28.601
Like what?

04:28.685 --> 04:32.647
Do you think we'd be friends
if it weren't for the band?

04:51.749 --> 04:52.709
I can't.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.168
What? Why not?

04:54.252 --> 04:55.795
The choreography is easy.

04:55.878 --> 04:58.256
Your perfume. You smell like my mom.

05:00.675 --> 05:04.554
If you don't want to rehearse, say so.
But don't make things up.

05:06.264 --> 05:09.475
This isn't the rehearsal room
for disqualified contestants.

05:09.976 --> 05:13.229
Is this where your band meets
to wear animal costumes?

05:13.313 --> 05:15.148
Let's talk about that.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.818
Can you give me a minute?

05:19.485 --> 05:21.404
-We're in the middle of--
-One minute.

05:21.487 --> 05:24.574
No. You can't order me around.
You're not the boss.

05:28.619 --> 05:32.123
Love, can you give me five minutes?
I have to talk to Luka.

05:32.623 --> 05:37.128
Love, you should use those five minutes
to get rid of that horrible smell.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.142
I don't get it.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.643
You forced me to do all of that.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.979
I did it, the band is out now.

05:55.855 --> 05:59.317
You said I'd win the Battle of the Bands,
now you're icing me out.

05:59.817 --> 06:01.277
What about what you promised me?

06:01.778 --> 06:02.779
You went quiet.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.447
You don't give the orders.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.657
Be patient. We're not on your time.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.409
Really?

06:10.495 --> 06:12.246
I don't have patience.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.498
So, you know what?

06:14.248 --> 06:15.875
I'll go to Celina's office.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.794
I'll show her the video.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.545
If she asks,

06:21.130 --> 06:22.173
I'll tell.

06:22.256 --> 06:25.510
Your costume party
will be over in seconds.

06:30.139 --> 06:31.140
Try it, then.

06:31.808 --> 06:32.975
Tell me how it goes.

06:41.776 --> 06:42.985
We would be friends.

06:44.445 --> 06:45.822
I mean, obviously,

06:45.905 --> 06:48.408
if the circumstances were different,

06:48.491 --> 06:50.243
maybe we wouldn't have even spoken.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.412
But that's life, right?

06:52.954 --> 06:55.998
For whatever reason, you move out,

06:56.082 --> 07:00.128
you end up in a classroom
where you meet incredible people,

07:00.211 --> 07:01.879
super talented people.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.674
People you grow fond of.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.552
That's what happened to us. Right?

07:08.678 --> 07:10.888
The Battle of the Bands gave us that.

07:11.889 --> 07:14.892
Do you really think Esteban betrayed us?

07:15.977 --> 07:17.770
The video is from his account.

07:19.188 --> 07:20.690
What if someone made him?

07:21.399 --> 07:23.276
You don't think he did it on purpose?

07:25.069 --> 07:27.989
Who wanted us out
of the Battle of the Bands?

07:28.072 --> 07:29.449
The Lodge.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.366
Sebas.

07:32.076 --> 07:34.328
Is there any chance he'll confess again?

07:34.412 --> 07:37.874
Obviously not,
but he's not the only member.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.459
We need to find someone else.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.919
And who else does he hang out with?

07:42.879 --> 07:44.172
Only idiots.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.175
Only idiots and?

07:48.759 --> 07:51.012
Who is he always with?

07:52.638 --> 07:53.806
No way, Dixon.

07:54.557 --> 07:58.102
I'm not saying Emilia's part of The Lodge,

07:58.728 --> 08:00.646
but she's the closest person to Sebas.

08:00.730 --> 08:01.939
It's just for show.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.524
Emilia hates him.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.735
You have nothing to lose by asking her.

08:07.195 --> 08:10.740
Sure. "Hey, Emilia.
Are you part of The Lodge?"

08:10.823 --> 08:14.410
"I wish you'd told me before.
It really would've helped."

08:14.994 --> 08:15.828
Please.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.040
If you're so sure,
there's nothing to worry about.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.716
Do you really think
I'm some dumb rich girl

08:28.799 --> 08:31.636
that spends her time playing
with a dumb secret club?

08:31.719 --> 08:34.722
And with that idiot, Sebas?
I thought you knew me better.

08:34.805 --> 08:37.266
It's just you're always with him.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.184
Rehearsing.

08:38.267 --> 08:41.771
That's when he's not throwing fits
and kicking me out like trash.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.899
Are you really doubting me?

08:45.399 --> 08:46.442
No.

08:47.276 --> 08:48.361
It's just…

08:48.444 --> 08:51.447
Fucking Sebas.
He's the reason we're disqualified

08:51.531 --> 08:54.367
and now we have to find out
who's behind The Lodge.

08:54.992 --> 08:55.910
You thought I was?

09:00.790 --> 09:02.124
Do you have any ideas?

09:02.625 --> 09:03.709
Honestly,

09:04.335 --> 09:07.129
I always thought
he was sleeping with someone.

09:08.422 --> 09:09.924
Okay. Who?

09:10.007 --> 09:11.717
I don't know, but she smells bad.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.761
Her perfume smells like my mom's.

09:14.595 --> 09:18.099
So he's sleeping with someone older.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.310
Or at least someone with bad taste.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.273
Dude, Sebas is banging some lady.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.858
Yeah, I saw a used condom in his dorm.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.236
No, like he's banging an older lady.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.906
An older lady as in…

09:35.283 --> 09:36.534
Like my grandma?

09:36.617 --> 09:37.785
No, not that old.

09:38.369 --> 09:41.163
Emilia thinks it's someone older than him.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.292
Like our biology teacher?

09:45.084 --> 09:47.837
Well, I don't think she's really his type.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.172
-Anita.
-What?

09:50.256 --> 09:51.090
Anita!

09:52.717 --> 09:55.469
I saw her last night
going into a classroom.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.306
What kind of assistant
stays at school that late?

09:58.389 --> 10:01.350
And what would she be doing
in a classroom so late?

10:02.852 --> 10:04.895
-Hooking up with someone.
-Exactly.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.398
How do we know it was Sebas?

10:07.481 --> 10:11.152
It makes total sense for The Lodge
to have someone in the administration.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.195
Anita's the perfect candidate.

10:13.279 --> 10:16.198
I'm sure she could get
the key to the RBD uniforms.

10:16.282 --> 10:19.493
And even if it's not her,
we could still expose her.

10:19.994 --> 10:23.956
It's against the rules
for an employee to sleep with a student.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.125
But we don't have any proof.

10:27.585 --> 10:28.836
It's always the same.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.715
I might have a plan.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.441
Need something?

10:50.524 --> 10:52.777
Celina's busy right now.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.654
That's fine, I'll wait.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.365
She'll be a while.

10:57.448 --> 11:00.326
If you want,
I can tell her you stopped by.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.578
No, don't worry. I have time.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.580
Let me explain.

11:04.664 --> 11:08.417
Her afternoon is swamped.

11:08.501 --> 11:12.004
Between the final,
your friend's disappearance…

11:12.088 --> 11:13.255
He's not my friend.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.591
No, of course not.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.344
A friend doesn't betray
those who trust him.

11:19.428 --> 11:22.181
But anything you want to tell Celina,

11:22.264 --> 11:23.599
you can tell me. Okay?

11:24.642 --> 11:26.852
What's wrong, Luka? You seem worried.

11:28.854 --> 11:29.689
Nothing.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.067
Okay, I'm glad.

11:33.943 --> 11:37.238
I mean,
what could a Colucci be worried about?

11:37.321 --> 11:38.906
Things always work out for you.

11:39.448 --> 11:40.449
Right?

11:52.211 --> 11:54.088
All right. I'll come back later.

11:54.714 --> 11:55.798
Great.

11:58.509 --> 12:01.137
Esteban took his things
and won't answer his phone.

12:02.638 --> 12:05.808
What kind of school
lets its students just leave?

12:06.308 --> 12:09.353
Believe me when I say
I'm very concerned about your son.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.983
I'm sure he wouldn't have left
if he hadn't been accused.

12:14.066 --> 12:17.194
I want to give your son
a chance to explain himself.

12:17.278 --> 12:19.363
What matters now is finding him.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.199
Do you have any idea where he could be?

12:26.120 --> 12:26.996
Maybe.

12:54.857 --> 12:55.691
Hi.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.026
Hi.

12:57.526 --> 12:58.527
Do you work here?

12:59.028 --> 13:01.113
No. I'm here to see Rocío,

13:01.197 --> 13:02.823
but I'm early.

13:03.491 --> 13:04.950
It's worth the wait.

13:05.034 --> 13:05.868
Really?

13:07.411 --> 13:08.245
Are you…

13:09.705 --> 13:10.581
A fan.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.751
Rocío's one of the best singers I know.

13:14.585 --> 13:15.544
Seriously.

13:16.212 --> 13:19.715
Why is one of the best singers you know
in a place like this?

13:19.799 --> 13:22.551
You need more than talent to make it.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.470
Like connections?

13:25.554 --> 13:29.350
It always helps to be
in the right place at the right time,

13:29.433 --> 13:30.851
but it's not everything.

13:30.935 --> 13:33.896
I think it has a lot to do
with who you know.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.149
That's true.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.401
For better,

13:40.152 --> 13:41.362
and for worse.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.111
<i>Anita's leaving.</i>
<i>She's heading for the dorms.</i>

14:42.631 --> 14:44.341
She didn't stop by Sebas' room.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.148
<i>She's headed toward the basketball court.</i>

15:08.616 --> 15:09.575
No way.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.166
She's gone.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.543
What do you mean? Where did she go?

15:19.627 --> 15:21.211
<i>I don't know. She turned a corner.</i>

15:21.962 --> 15:25.925
She must be meeting Sebas somewhere else.
Where else could they be hooking up?

15:26.008 --> 15:29.136
<i>The janitor's closet, the music room,</i>

15:29.219 --> 15:30.679
<i>the kitchen, behind the kitchen.</i>

15:30.763 --> 15:33.265
Aren't there dumpsters behind the kitchen?

15:33.349 --> 15:36.477
<i>Pretty much anywhere after 10:00 p.m.</i>

15:36.560 --> 15:39.396
<i>-The chapel…</i>
<i>-</i>Since when is there a chapel here?

15:39.480 --> 15:40.314
It's too late.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.234
I mean, to be out of your room.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.613
I know. I couldn't sleep.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.366
I understand.
It happens to me all the time.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.786
If you want, let's take a walk
until you get tired.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.621
If you want.

15:56.789 --> 15:57.665
Sleepwalking?

15:57.748 --> 15:59.667
I've never heard that excuse before.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.336
It's a real condition. It's serious.

16:02.836 --> 16:05.589
Look, another sleepwalker.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.007
There must be an outbreak.

16:07.091 --> 16:10.094
Maybe if we wait five minutes,
La Llorona will show up.

16:10.177 --> 16:13.347
Go straight to your rooms. Now.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.770
I bet those two won't finish out the year.

16:22.147 --> 16:25.275
By the way,
what are you doing here so late?

16:26.402 --> 16:27.945
The same as you.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.697
Keeping the school in order.

16:31.907 --> 16:35.995
The only one who keeps order here is me.

16:38.455 --> 16:40.249
ANYONE? ANSWER ME.

16:40.332 --> 16:43.168
I FOLLOWED YOUR INSTRUCTIONS.
WHAT'S NEXT? ANSWER. HELLO?

17:23.500 --> 17:24.334
Now what?

17:25.419 --> 17:26.754
We try again.

17:27.254 --> 17:28.630
With Lourdes out there?

17:29.256 --> 17:31.008
We could try tomorrow.

17:31.091 --> 17:33.719
No, that won't work.
She'll be extra careful.

17:33.802 --> 17:37.306
She'll even stop screwing Sebas,
just to be safe,

17:37.389 --> 17:39.475
which she should've done eons ago.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.976
Do you have a better idea?

17:41.769 --> 17:43.771
Do any of you have a better idea?

17:43.854 --> 17:45.564
You don't need to be like that.

17:45.647 --> 17:49.568
Sorry. I'm trying to fix this,
and it seems like you guys

17:49.651 --> 17:50.569
don't give a fuck.

17:50.652 --> 17:54.531
No, you're trying to prove
Esteban's innocence, which doesn't--

17:54.615 --> 17:56.116
Because Esteban is innocent.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.661
Well, he uploaded the video.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.164
And I don't get it either.

18:02.831 --> 18:04.917
But all we know is he's gone,

18:05.000 --> 18:08.212
he's not answering anyone,
and he left us with this goddamn mess.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.588
Maybe it was you.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.216
-Come on, Jana.
-What?

18:12.299 --> 18:14.301
I'm serious, maybe Emilia swayed you.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.303
It wouldn't be the first time you lied.

18:16.386 --> 18:17.596
Wow.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.098
You're crazy.

18:20.766 --> 18:21.934
Luka was right.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.103
We're not friends.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.521
We're just pretending.

18:45.749 --> 18:48.669
<i>Take a punch, take a swing on me</i>

18:48.752 --> 18:51.505
<i>'Cause I'm up when I'm down</i>

18:52.756 --> 18:56.802
<i>I don't care what you say</i>

18:56.885 --> 19:00.139
<i>What you do</i>

19:02.057 --> 19:05.477
<i>I'm much stronger</i>
<i>Can take it for longer</i>

19:05.561 --> 19:07.896
<i>'Cause I've been around</i>

19:09.273 --> 19:11.358
<i>I can feel</i>

19:11.441 --> 19:13.360
<i>And I will</i>

19:13.443 --> 19:16.238
<i>Get through</i>

19:17.072 --> 19:22.786
<i>'Cause I've got no regrets</i>

19:22.870 --> 19:26.331
<i>No worries</i>

19:26.415 --> 19:28.500
<i>And if it stays that way</i>

19:28.584 --> 19:33.547
<i>I'll be okay</i>

19:33.630 --> 19:38.927
<i>'Cause I've got no regrets</i>

19:39.011 --> 19:42.514
<i>No regrets</i>

19:43.724 --> 19:48.145
THE LODGE MADE ME FORCE ESTEBAN
TO SWITCH THE VIDEO

19:54.985 --> 19:56.278
I…

19:59.489 --> 20:04.203
I MADE ESTEBAN DO IT

20:32.606 --> 20:35.234
6 A.M. BE ON TIME.

20:57.297 --> 20:58.173
What's wrong?

20:59.132 --> 21:01.009
You and Esteban are hiding something.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.053
I saw you.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.307
Esteban isn't what he seems.

21:08.016 --> 21:09.476
That's all I'll say.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.354
Stop trusting people so much.

21:14.064 --> 21:15.732
Not everyone is what they seem.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.789
Hi, can I talk to you?

21:31.373 --> 21:33.208
I'm on my way out. Excuse me.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.293
Wait.

21:39.798 --> 21:40.882
I'm your son.

21:42.009 --> 21:44.303
You're confusing me with someone else.

21:45.262 --> 21:47.097
Your real name is Rocío García.

22:13.457 --> 22:16.376
I wrote this song for you when I was five.

22:19.212 --> 22:20.630
No, actually…

22:22.632 --> 22:23.884
I wrote it for you.

22:53.830 --> 22:55.415
But I never finished it.

22:57.125 --> 22:59.878
I guess you were meant to do it.

23:09.638 --> 23:12.766
You had years to look for me,
if you were interested.

23:13.266 --> 23:15.769
Did you want me
to show up out of the blue?

23:16.395 --> 23:17.562
Like I just did?

23:20.774 --> 23:22.067
What do you want to know?

23:25.529 --> 23:26.738
I have this.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.878
I want to know why Marcelo Colucci
told you to stay away.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.964
Why did he offer you money?

23:44.589 --> 23:48.301
You can tell me, or I can ask him.
Your call.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.229
Marcelo is your father.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.727
-<i>Jani.</i>
-Mom?

24:44.900 --> 24:47.611
Marcelo was only a fling.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.280
Or at least I thought.

24:51.072 --> 24:52.908
I was already married to Chava.

24:54.034 --> 24:55.577
I didn't tell him anything.

24:56.286 --> 24:57.496
Or Marcelo.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.957
I needed a job.

25:01.458 --> 25:02.792
So I went to Marcelo,

25:02.876 --> 25:06.004
and he offered to hire me
as Luka's music teacher.

25:09.633 --> 25:10.717
It was a shock.

25:12.010 --> 25:15.972
Seeing all that his son had
made me think of you.

25:18.099 --> 25:20.435
I thought of the life you could've had

25:21.269 --> 25:22.646
that I couldn't give you.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.608
That was when I told Marcelo

25:27.609 --> 25:28.568
the truth.

25:30.403 --> 25:32.614
I regretted it as soon as I told him.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.867
Because I understood,

25:37.035 --> 25:38.370
despite everything,

25:38.870 --> 25:42.123
that I didn't want you
to suffer the way Luka did.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.045
What the fuck does that have to do
with you abandoning me?

25:51.716 --> 25:52.926
You wouldn't understand.

25:53.009 --> 25:54.844
-What's going on here?
-Why not?

25:55.554 --> 25:56.638
Why did you leave me?

25:56.721 --> 25:57.847
What did you tell him?

25:58.765 --> 26:00.392
What happened? What did she say?

26:23.456 --> 26:25.625
Am I winning
the Battle of the Bands or not?

26:26.293 --> 26:28.461
Patience is a virtue.

26:29.629 --> 26:32.674
The fortune cookie advice is boring me.

26:33.466 --> 26:34.718
Let's be clear.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.470
Remember who you're dealing with.

26:37.554 --> 26:40.015
Remember how powerful we are.

26:40.932 --> 26:41.766
So,

26:42.559 --> 26:43.643
what happens now?

26:44.644 --> 26:46.021
Do you trust us?

26:51.943 --> 26:53.236
I hate this thing.

27:04.998 --> 27:07.125
You know, I didn't see that coming.

27:07.792 --> 27:10.837
I mean, I know all of you guys.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.839
They have golf club memberships,

27:12.922 --> 27:15.717
but what kind of assets do you have?

27:15.800 --> 27:17.344
A loyalty rewards card?

27:17.844 --> 27:18.678
Idiot.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.105
Welcome to The Lodge.

27:32.108 --> 27:33.401
Do you want to win, Luka?

27:33.902 --> 27:36.154
Well, you have to win,

27:36.237 --> 27:37.364
with us, Luka.

27:51.961 --> 27:53.380
You knew, didn't you?

27:57.717 --> 27:58.551
Yes.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.806
I'm guessing you're angry.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.687
There are only two things
that need to happen right now.

28:10.313 --> 28:11.189
First,

28:12.107 --> 28:13.108
you need to know…

28:17.445 --> 28:19.280
you're my son and I love you.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.787
And nothing will ever change that.

28:26.830 --> 28:27.664
Ever.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.460
And the second thing?

28:36.214 --> 28:38.216
I need to know where we're going.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.775
<i>I walk</i>

28:55.859 --> 28:57.652
<i>I'll follow you</i>

28:57.736 --> 29:00.864
<i>Until I find myself</i>

29:00.947 --> 29:03.992
<i>I give you my wings</i>

29:04.075 --> 29:06.369
<i>I'll always shine on you</i>

29:06.953 --> 29:10.206
<i>What do you feel, my heart</i>?

29:10.290 --> 29:12.792
<i>Are you tired of hurting?</i>

29:12.876 --> 29:17.714
<i>Of being lied to?</i>

29:18.923 --> 29:21.926
<i>Dark shadows</i>

29:22.010 --> 29:24.846
<i>Hiding the truth</i>

29:25.472 --> 29:28.224
<i>My voice is my own</i>

29:28.308 --> 29:31.770
<i>It can't be controlled</i>

29:31.853 --> 29:38.234
<i>And I promise my heart will withstand</i>

29:38.318 --> 29:44.532
<i>I'll hold on because I need to wake up</i>

29:46.618 --> 29:51.247
<i>I won't forget the past</i>

29:52.332 --> 29:57.337
<i>I can rewrite it</i>

30:24.239 --> 30:25.156
Thank you.

30:29.744 --> 30:30.870
Sweetie.

30:35.458 --> 30:37.126
Don't look so sad, Janucha.

30:37.919 --> 30:39.170
In the end,

30:39.671 --> 30:42.173
we always knew this school wasn't for you.

30:43.716 --> 30:44.801
Let's go.

33:24.085 --> 33:25.920
