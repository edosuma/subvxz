01:15.450 --> 01:17.452
Hey, look at this, Jeff.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.205
There's something wrong with this symbol.

01:20.539 --> 01:22.875
Doesn't fit the rest of the wall.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.043
Stop right there!

01:25.836 --> 01:26.879
Where were you?

01:26.962 --> 01:30.299
Guys, I found a major clue.
This could lead to...

01:30.799 --> 01:34.303
You're here to help,
not to play at being an archaeologist.

01:34.511 --> 01:35.846
Clean the brushes.

01:36.388 --> 01:37.431
That was awesome, guys.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.933
And put out that torch.
You're gonna burn the place down.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.686
Use a flashlight. It's the 21st century.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.314
Guys, I think it could be important.

01:46.190 --> 01:47.858
Okay, let me see.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.902
-Can you read it?
-Please.

01:51.987 --> 01:54.948
"Find the true path and its detours.

01:55.282 --> 01:58.702
"Trust the stranger. He is the wisdom."

01:59.161 --> 02:01.663
Well, typical Mayan wordiness.
Doesn't mean anything.

02:01.872 --> 02:04.374
Guys, I got it! I think I know what to do.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.418
Yeah, I told you. Clean the brushes.

02:06.502 --> 02:09.630
What? No.
I think we just need to press here.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.721
Who's gonna tell his girlfriend?

02:35.489 --> 02:36.865
What the...

02:53.674 --> 02:55.425
Jeff, don't touch! Jeff!

02:56.677 --> 02:58.011
No!

02:58.262 --> 03:00.222
Would you please stop?

03:08.814 --> 03:11.149
What's this doing in Mexico?

03:11.775 --> 03:14.152
An Egyptian sarcophagus?

03:29.251 --> 03:31.044
Jeff, run! Jump!

03:34.131 --> 03:36.425
Come on, buddy, come on! Hurry!

03:44.057 --> 03:45.058
Jeff!

03:52.900 --> 03:54.568
Jeff, stay right there.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.210
No, stay there, Jeff!

04:12.377 --> 04:14.630
No, don't! Stop! Stop!

04:14.796 --> 04:16.130
Oh, no!

04:30.270 --> 04:32.439
Sara! You won't believe
what I found down...

04:32.606 --> 04:35.484
What on Earth happened?
How did you fall down an abyss?

04:35.651 --> 04:36.652
Are you okay?

04:36.860 --> 04:39.196
Totally. It wasn't that big of a deal.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.118
No problem. I can fix it.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.917
You idiot! You're completely useless!

04:52.084 --> 04:54.878
It'll take us days
to open up another cave.

04:55.045 --> 04:57.172
Okay, I'm sorry. If you'd just let me...

04:57.256 --> 04:59.967
No! I won't just let you, Stones.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.261
How can I put it? In Sumerian?

05:02.344 --> 05:03.470
In Etruscan?

05:03.637 --> 05:07.432
This team is formed of the world's
most prestigious archaeologists.

05:07.516 --> 05:08.767
And the brightest ones.

05:08.851 --> 05:10.435
And the coolest ones.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.604
And that's not you.

05:12.688 --> 05:15.899
Right, okay. It's just that down there,
there's actually no tr...

05:15.983 --> 05:17.401
Look, it was an accident.

05:17.484 --> 05:21.113
We were one step away
from finding the treasure of King Pakal.

05:21.196 --> 05:22.489
Don't defend him.

05:22.573 --> 05:25.784
Look, I'm sorry,
but there's no treasure down there.

05:25.868 --> 05:29.121
Just an Egyptian sarcophagus?

05:33.458 --> 05:36.712
How you managed to convince us
to bring along this amateur

05:36.795 --> 05:40.966
incapable of telling Egyptian symbology
apart from Pre-Columbian!

05:41.049 --> 05:44.136
He hasn't even finished his degree.
At his age!

05:44.219 --> 05:48.182
Yeah, all right. But I've had adventures
no one could teach you in a classroom.

05:48.765 --> 05:52.186
What adventures, pray tell?
Please, do enlighten us.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.397
Well, I...

06:02.070 --> 06:05.324
You're a danger to archaeology.
You're out!

06:05.407 --> 06:06.408
What?

06:06.491 --> 06:09.620
And don't forget to take that dog
and your demented parrot with you.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.997
What has Belzoni ever done to you?

06:12.372 --> 06:13.957
He eats my fajitas!

06:20.964 --> 06:22.591
Tad, don't let them get to you.

06:23.133 --> 06:27.596
If they knew I found Paititi
and the collar of King Midas...

06:27.804 --> 06:29.306
I know, but we both agreed.

06:29.473 --> 06:32.351
Yeah, yeah, I know. It's too dangerous

06:32.434 --> 06:34.102
and best to keep it a secret.

06:35.771 --> 06:36.813
Chin up, Tad.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.233
You and I know what we discovered.

06:39.483 --> 06:42.444
I promise you
there was a sarcophagus down there.

06:42.528 --> 06:45.572
I believe you.
But this is their expedition.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.282
I'll go back to Chicago with you.

06:47.366 --> 06:49.618
No, I feel guilty enough already.

06:49.701 --> 06:53.622
This is too important to the university
for you to bail on the team.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.042
I just wanted to be a part of it.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.087
Don't worry, Tad. Your time will come.

07:00.712 --> 07:05.008
Sooner or later, everyone will realize
just how great an archaeologist you are.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.846
Tad, I feel I should go back with you.

07:12.891 --> 07:15.060
Are you sure you want me to stay?

07:16.603 --> 07:20.107
Sure, sure. I mean, please stay.
I'm totally fine.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.441
Okay.

07:21.692 --> 07:23.277
See you in Chicago.

07:30.993 --> 07:33.120
I have something that may interest you.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.500
I know. It's been found.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.081
Home sweet home.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.344
Jeff, come here!

08:30.427 --> 08:32.346
Jeff, come back! Come back here!

08:33.429 --> 08:35.765
No! Give me that right now! Jeff!

08:39.436 --> 08:40.437
Jeff!

08:42.731 --> 08:43.732
Miscreant!

08:44.525 --> 08:46.235
Yeah. Hello, Mrs. Wolfstrom.

08:46.485 --> 08:49.613
The tenants are very concerned
about the goings on in your apartment.

08:50.072 --> 08:53.742
Every night there are shouts, thuds,
and it stinks to death in there!

08:53.909 --> 08:54.952
Stinks to... What?

08:55.118 --> 08:57.955
And the number of odd parcels
that keep arriving.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.499
-Admit it, you're a smuggler!
-Okay. Yes. All right. I got you.

09:00.582 --> 09:02.584
I'm gonna call the police.
The FBI. The CIA.

09:02.668 --> 09:05.212
-Good night, Mrs. Wolfstrom. Bye!
-You're the worst tenant in this building.

09:05.295 --> 09:06.296
Jeff?

09:13.136 --> 09:14.471
What the...

09:52.259 --> 09:53.260
Buddy!

09:53.343 --> 09:54.511
You're back at last!

09:54.595 --> 09:56.263
Okay, all right.
It's good to see you, too.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.348
Come on. Let me just get dressed.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.309
I thought of a thousand things
we could do together.

10:00.392 --> 10:04.062
Go see an NBA game, see a Lizzo concert,
try a Six Guys burger.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.898
How did you know all this?

10:06.064 --> 10:09.234
Thanks to the world's
most incredible invention:

10:09.401 --> 10:10.402
The Internet!

10:10.611 --> 10:12.779
Quick, record me
and I'll put it on Instazam.

10:13.614 --> 10:16.658
-You're on Instazam?
-And I got six followers!

10:16.825 --> 10:18.744
But how did you pay for all of this?

10:18.911 --> 10:21.079
With the other most incredible invention:

10:21.163 --> 10:22.706
The magic plastic.

10:23.123 --> 10:28.253
I gave you that for emergencies.
You spent all my savings on useless stuff!

10:28.587 --> 10:29.588
Useless?

10:29.671 --> 10:31.673
You think this is useless?

10:33.550 --> 10:35.719
Delivery! I'll leave it by the door.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.304
Now what have you ordered?

10:42.684 --> 10:44.353
At last! My jet ski!

10:44.436 --> 10:46.563
That's it! No more card for you.

10:47.272 --> 10:51.193
I'm sorry. But I've been locked up in here
for two months all by myself.

10:51.276 --> 10:52.736
When you came back from Paititi,

10:52.819 --> 10:55.030
we agreed you wouldn't set foot outside.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.366
Well, I came to have adventures with you,

10:57.449 --> 11:00.494
not to count all the cockroaches
living in your kitchen for all eternity.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.246
There's 13, by the way.

11:02.329 --> 11:05.707
Well, we'll talk about it later, okay?
I'm not in the mood right now.

11:10.921 --> 11:13.549
What's the matter, buddy?
Tell old Uncle Mummy.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.260
I got fired from the dig.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.344
What?

11:17.427 --> 11:19.930
But you're the best archaeologist
in the world!

11:20.013 --> 11:21.431
You found me!

11:21.974 --> 11:23.517
Right. I found you.

11:24.309 --> 11:27.312
Which is the umpteenth thing
I can't tell those guys.

11:33.235 --> 11:34.862
Go, go, go.

11:35.904 --> 11:36.989
Go!

11:37.573 --> 11:39.575
-Pull! Pull!
-Look out! Don't damage it!

11:46.832 --> 11:49.710
Come on, through here, let's go.

11:53.589 --> 11:55.632
That's freaking awesome!

11:55.716 --> 11:57.342
Careful! Slow it down.

11:59.094 --> 12:01.054
-Look at that.
-I can't believe it.

12:01.138 --> 12:02.514
Egyptian symbology.

12:02.598 --> 12:04.266
Archaic Period, Fourth Dynasty.

12:04.349 --> 12:07.311
4,000 years of antiquity.
These marks suggest that...

12:07.394 --> 12:08.478
Tad was right.

12:11.190 --> 12:12.900
Don't even mention that name.

12:12.983 --> 12:16.069
The only thing he achieved
was to set everything back.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.448
I've never seen hieroglyphics
like these before.

12:20.157 --> 12:22.492
It's a very ancient dialect. It says...

12:23.118 --> 12:26.914
"Chaos. Destruction. Liposuction."

12:29.249 --> 12:31.835
Oh, no, it says, "Curses, many curses."

12:31.919 --> 12:33.462
It's too soon to draw conclusions.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.547
We'll take it to Chicago,
take a proper look.

12:35.631 --> 12:38.133
Hey, this is a bullseye, guys!

12:40.761 --> 12:42.304
Brush for dust and sand.

12:42.387 --> 12:45.182
Not to be confused
with the brush for sand and dust.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.435
Or with the brush for cleaning bones.

12:48.519 --> 12:51.188
Nor, of course, with the brush
for cleaning rocks.

12:51.313 --> 12:53.482
Or the makeup brush.
That's an immediate fail.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.109
And just look at these!

12:56.193 --> 12:59.613
The other 75 types of brushes.
You can clean anything you want with 'em!

13:02.741 --> 13:04.701
Are we boring you, Mr. Stones?

13:04.785 --> 13:06.495
No, Professor. I...

13:06.578 --> 13:07.746
I am happy to hear it.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.874
Patience is an archaeologist's
number-two tool.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.001
So, what's number one?

13:13.085 --> 13:14.503
The brush!

13:25.514 --> 13:26.849
Sara!

13:30.769 --> 13:31.854
Yes?

13:32.104 --> 13:33.605
<i>Hello, Mr. Stones.</i>

13:33.856 --> 13:36.233
<i>Do you see that car</i>
<i>parked in front of you?</i>

13:38.610 --> 13:40.362
Sorry, who is this?

13:40.696 --> 13:42.322
<i>All in good time.</i>

13:42.948 --> 13:45.367
<i>I know what you discovered in Mexico.</i>

13:45.701 --> 13:49.538
<i>Get in the car. I'm about to propose</i>
<i>the adventure of your life.</i>

14:01.175 --> 14:04.011
Sorry, but... But where are we going?

14:08.265 --> 14:10.017
Well, at least tell me who we're...

14:39.046 --> 14:40.130
Hello?

14:46.720 --> 14:48.388
Hello, Mr. Stones!

14:48.931 --> 14:51.767
Welcome! I am Professor Victoria Moon,

14:51.850 --> 14:53.644
investigator of the occult.

14:54.436 --> 14:57.439
You have a terrible aura.
Let me clean it up for you.

14:57.606 --> 14:58.899
Let you what?

15:05.322 --> 15:06.990
There. All clean now.

15:07.449 --> 15:10.452
Wait, you're Victoria Moon
from Mystery TV?

15:10.702 --> 15:15.999
24 hours a day of unexplained phenomena,
astral projection and unsolved mysteries.

15:18.752 --> 15:23.090
<i>Two hundred years later and the enigma</i>
<i>remains in the spiritual world.</i>

15:23.257 --> 15:26.510
<i>Tonight, in "Chatting with Celebrities,"</i>

15:26.593 --> 15:29.346
<i>we'll ask van Gogh where he hid his ear!</i>

15:29.763 --> 15:34.768
<i>And remember, the world you see is just</i>
<i>a fragment of the world that exists.</i>

15:38.689 --> 15:40.691
That was very interesting.

15:41.233 --> 15:45.279
Don't worry. I know I have
a poor reputation among archaeologists.

15:45.529 --> 15:47.781
They ignore the fact that this world

15:47.865 --> 15:50.742
is full of phenomena
that go beyond all reason.

15:52.870 --> 15:54.204
Take a look at this.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.790
It looks like a battle in Egypt.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.626
It's the great battle
of the Pharaoh Cheops

15:59.710 --> 16:03.380
against his sorcerer, Hermes Trismegistus.

16:04.256 --> 16:08.677
<i>Legend has it that Hermes created</i>
<i>an object with the power of the gods</i>

16:08.760 --> 16:11.972
which controlled magic:
<i>The Emerald Tablet.</i>

16:13.390 --> 16:14.725
<i>Thanks to its power,</i>

16:14.808 --> 16:19.438
<i>the kingdom of Cheops achieved</i>
<i>heights of splendor never before seen.</i>

16:19.813 --> 16:22.441
<i>Tired of the pharaoh</i>
<i>never acknowledging his merits,</i>

16:22.608 --> 16:25.485
<i>Hermes decided to harness</i>
<i>the power of the tablet</i>

16:25.569 --> 16:26.945
<i>to overthrow him.</i>

16:27.112 --> 16:30.949
<i>He created an enchantment</i>
<i>to unleash the beasts of the underworld</i>

16:31.033 --> 16:33.118
<i>against Cheops's armies.</i>

16:33.285 --> 16:35.287
<i>But the pharaoh discovered the plan</i>

16:35.370 --> 16:39.249
<i>and he hid the tablet so that no one</i>
<i>would ever be able to use it again.</i>

16:39.833 --> 16:41.835
<i>The legend spread throughout the world.</i>

16:42.002 --> 16:45.130
<i>All the great conquerors of history</i>
<i>searched high and low for it,</i>

16:45.214 --> 16:46.673
<i>hungry for its power.</i>

16:46.924 --> 16:50.427
<i>Alexander the Great,</i>
<i>Caesar, Attila the Hun.</i>

16:50.594 --> 16:53.931
But only one found it: <i>Napoleon Bonaparte.</i>

16:56.600 --> 17:00.103
<i>But such was the tablet's power</i>
<i>that he could not control it.</i>

17:00.354 --> 17:04.316
<i>Filled with fear, and to stop it</i>
<i>from falling into enemies' hands,</i>

17:04.398 --> 17:07.694
<i>Napoleon ordered to return the tablet</i>
<i>to its hideout</i>

17:07.861 --> 17:10.531
<i>and erase all trace of its whereabouts.</i>

17:10.864 --> 17:13.784
<i>But his archaeologist,</i>
<i>Dominique Vivant Denon,</i>

17:13.867 --> 17:17.371
<i>left behind an engraving</i>
<i>that leads to the tablet.</i>

17:22.501 --> 17:24.877
An engraving? So where is it?

17:24.962 --> 17:26.171
Nobody knows.

17:26.255 --> 17:29.967
But I bet all my chakras
it's in his old office in the Louvre.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.134
The Louvre?

17:31.218 --> 17:33.011
Dominique was the museum's first director,

17:33.095 --> 17:36.849
but his office disappeared during
the first renovations of the building.

17:36.932 --> 17:38.308
How do you know all this?

17:38.392 --> 17:41.770
I have found a lot of information here
in his personal diary,

17:41.854 --> 17:44.731
but there is also a lot
I can't make head or tail of.

17:45.023 --> 17:47.609
I'd abandoned all hope
of finding the tablet

17:47.693 --> 17:50.696
until your little adventure in Mexico.

17:51.196 --> 17:52.573
How did you know that...

17:52.656 --> 17:54.950
And what does all this
have to do with the tablet?

18:01.331 --> 18:05.335
It's a fragment of the tablet.
It started shining three days ago.

18:06.378 --> 18:08.589
When I found the sarcophagus.

18:16.889 --> 18:19.183
Coincidence? I think not.

18:20.184 --> 18:23.562
That sarcophagus contains
the remains of Hermes, the sorcerer.

18:23.645 --> 18:26.648
Inside, there must be clues
that lead to the tablet!

18:26.732 --> 18:29.526
I need you to persuade your team
to work with us.

18:29.610 --> 18:31.445
Yeah, well, it's not exactly my team.

18:31.528 --> 18:34.573
I know you have a good relationship
with Dr. Sara Lavrof.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.742
-Yeah, but...
-Tell her the sarcophagus

18:36.825 --> 18:38.744
can be opened with the guardian's pendant,

18:38.827 --> 18:41.663
-that thing your dog gobbled up!
-How did you know about that?

18:41.747 --> 18:44.625
Trust me, when they see
you know how to open it,

18:44.708 --> 18:47.336
they'll have no choice
but to listen to us.

18:52.424 --> 18:54.218
Mummy, you're not gonna believe
what I just...

18:54.301 --> 18:55.677
Look out, Princess!

18:56.470 --> 18:59.181
Yeah, I'm gonna save you.
There's too many of them.

18:59.264 --> 19:01.058
No! You're not my father.

19:01.141 --> 19:03.310
No! I'm your mother! Who am I?

19:03.393 --> 19:05.687
Sara, hi! I got totally sidetracked.

19:05.771 --> 19:07.981
Tad, turn on a TV. Hurry!

19:08.315 --> 19:09.525
TV. Got it.

19:09.608 --> 19:12.444
<i>Where have you been?</i>
<i>I've been calling you for hours.</i>

19:12.528 --> 19:15.697
I'm so sorry. You are gonna flip out
when you hear what...

19:16.782 --> 19:18.033
Okay, the TV's on.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.535
<i>This just in.</i>

19:19.618 --> 19:24.206
<i>An international team of archaeologists</i>
<i>has located an Egyptian sarcophagus in,</i>

19:24.289 --> 19:26.625
<i>hold onto your hats, Mexico.</i>

19:26.708 --> 19:29.127
<i>A few hours ago,</i>
<i>they landed back in Chicago</i>

19:29.211 --> 19:30.546
<i>and were mobbed by the press</i>

19:30.629 --> 19:31.880
<i>-about this exciting discovery.</i>
-Come on, Princess,

19:31.964 --> 19:34.132
-let's jump on the moon.
-Mummy, please!

19:34.508 --> 19:38.262
When my team and I found the sarcophagus,
we were blown away.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.973
Nobody could ever have imagined
something like this.

19:41.056 --> 19:43.350
Nobody? It was me who found it!

19:43.433 --> 19:45.060
Talk about posers.

19:45.143 --> 19:47.062
Giorgio Tsoukalos, Ghost International.

19:47.145 --> 19:48.897
For years, Victoria Moon has been positing

19:48.981 --> 19:51.316
that the world's pyramids
are linked by occult forces.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.861
-What are your thoughts on this?
-Freaktoria Moon?

19:53.944 --> 19:57.239
Sure, we called her, but her crystal ball
couldn't get a signal.

19:58.824 --> 20:00.492
Sara, where's the sarcophagus?

20:00.576 --> 20:01.577
In the faculty.

20:01.660 --> 20:03.954
They're giving a press conference
as soon as they can open it,

20:04.037 --> 20:05.622
but they've been unable to do it yet.

20:05.706 --> 20:07.457
Okay, guys, bring it into position.

20:07.541 --> 20:08.750
But I know how to do it!

20:08.834 --> 20:11.920
Sara, that sarcophagus is the key
to finding the Emerald Tablet.

20:12.546 --> 20:15.132
The Emerald Tablet?
How do you know about that?

20:15.215 --> 20:18.719
Yeah, well, it was Professor Moon.
But listen, she's offered to help.

20:18.802 --> 20:20.637
Victoria Moon got in touch with you?

20:20.721 --> 20:23.223
Don't listen to anything
that woman has to say.

20:23.307 --> 20:25.184
Why not? Do you know her?

20:25.893 --> 20:27.644
We went to school together.

20:27.728 --> 20:30.647
We were friends until she got weird.

20:31.523 --> 20:32.774
Okay, that's fine.

20:37.029 --> 20:38.113
Dr. Lavrof!

20:38.447 --> 20:41.366
Tad, I have to go. I'll see you tomorrow.

20:41.450 --> 20:44.369
<i>-We'll talk about it then.</i>
-Sara, Sara... No, wait! Sara!

20:44.828 --> 20:45.954
It's not fair!

20:46.121 --> 20:48.582
Well, of course not.
Victoria Moon is no freak.

20:48.665 --> 20:51.418
Thanks to her,
I learned how to trap spirits in jars.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.337
Antonio!

20:53.545 --> 20:56.173
Finally I've made a discovery
for the whole world to see

20:56.256 --> 20:58.300
and I'm out of the picture again!

20:59.051 --> 21:00.552
I have to do something.

21:01.136 --> 21:02.137
It's okay, Tad.

21:02.221 --> 21:05.766
Someday you'll be able to show everybody
just how awesome you really are.

21:06.642 --> 21:09.478
Right. And it's gonna be tonight.

21:09.895 --> 21:13.524
That's what I'm talking about!
Tad and Mummy on the case.

22:05.158 --> 22:07.077
Hey, there you go!

22:07.160 --> 22:09.079
You're about to open the sarcophagus.

22:09.162 --> 22:10.747
Way to go, buddy!

22:10.914 --> 22:13.792
I think he should be part of our team.
What do you think?

22:13.876 --> 22:15.502
Sure. Come on!

22:41.153 --> 22:42.446
That's... That's...

22:46.408 --> 22:49.411
...the scrawniest mummy
I've ever seen in my life.

22:49.494 --> 22:52.247
Who dares to call me scrawny?

22:53.081 --> 22:54.625
Sorry! I didn't mean it!

22:54.708 --> 22:58.795
I shall devour your soul
if you do not give kiss, Tad.

22:59.421 --> 23:02.049
Kiss? What? How do you know my name?

23:06.011 --> 23:08.514
Gotcha! You should've seen your face!

23:08.597 --> 23:10.474
What are you doing here?

23:10.557 --> 23:13.185
I came back from Paititi
for adventures with my bestie,

23:13.268 --> 23:15.395
not to stay home looking after Jeff.

23:15.854 --> 23:17.272
You brought Jeff?

23:17.356 --> 23:20.442
Of course. No way I was leaving him
at home with Belzoni.

23:21.735 --> 23:23.695
Okay, fine, you can stay.

23:23.779 --> 23:25.364
But don't touch anything.

23:30.661 --> 23:31.995
Okay, let's see.

23:33.247 --> 23:35.916
This is perfect
for my hieroglyph translator app.

23:39.670 --> 23:42.881
Oh, poor thing. So trapped in there.

23:43.340 --> 23:45.676
I know just how you feel, bro.

23:45.759 --> 23:47.719
Okay, so,

23:47.803 --> 23:50.639
this is either a recipe for a cake

23:50.722 --> 23:52.641
or a threat of a curse?

23:53.267 --> 23:55.811
Mummy, let's not touch anything,
just in case.

23:57.479 --> 23:58.605
I'm sorry, you were saying?

23:58.981 --> 24:00.399
What have you done?

24:41.190 --> 24:42.191
Guys?

24:46.236 --> 24:47.237
Belzoni!

24:47.321 --> 24:49.448
What happened? Are you guys okay?

24:53.827 --> 24:56.538
What just happened? That was intense.

24:56.622 --> 24:58.207
I'm all good, don't worry.

25:00.292 --> 25:01.293
Your face!

25:01.376 --> 25:03.212
My face? What happened to my face?

25:06.673 --> 25:07.716
Your legs!

25:08.509 --> 25:10.135
What is happening to me?

25:13.096 --> 25:15.265
My legs! I can't control them!

25:15.349 --> 25:16.475
Mummy, stop!

25:16.558 --> 25:19.394
What part of "I can't control my legs"
do you not understand?

25:32.366 --> 25:33.367
Mummy!

25:36.912 --> 25:40.707
Mummy, stop it!
Just try to get ahold of yourself!

25:40.791 --> 25:42.000
I'm trying!

25:43.043 --> 25:45.295
Look out!

25:47.589 --> 25:49.716
Stop it, I said!

26:12.906 --> 26:13.907
Mummy, stop!

26:14.908 --> 26:16.285
I can't!

26:16.368 --> 26:18.203
Mummy! The sarcophagus!

26:18.287 --> 26:20.330
Will you just get out of the way, Tad!

26:28.881 --> 26:29.882
Mummy!

26:30.215 --> 26:33.427
-Are you okay?
-What just happened?

26:40.726 --> 26:42.895
Come on, we have to get out of here.

26:43.854 --> 26:45.772
Oh, wait, my backpack!

26:48.734 --> 26:50.652
There's no time. Let's go!

27:03.957 --> 27:05.959
How are we gonna get out of this one?

27:06.877 --> 27:09.213
It's Jeff, but with Belzoni's body.

27:09.296 --> 27:10.923
I'm gonna call you Jeffzoni.

27:16.053 --> 27:17.554
Maybe Beljeff is better.

27:17.721 --> 27:20.474
You have destroyed the faculty,
you look like Dracula,

27:20.557 --> 27:22.684
and to top it all off, you're cursed!

27:23.227 --> 27:25.395
Dracula? Awesome.

27:25.979 --> 27:27.022
The curse...

27:27.105 --> 27:30.442
The curse, it had to have come
from the Emerald Tablet! That's it!

27:30.526 --> 27:31.902
We have to find it.

27:34.530 --> 27:36.532
If I find it, I'll be the hero

27:36.698 --> 27:40.118
and they'll understand
it was all just one big accident.

27:40.285 --> 27:42.663
That-a-boy! So, what's the plan?

27:42.955 --> 27:44.623
We have to go to Paris.

27:45.040 --> 27:47.376
Paris? We're going to Paris?

27:47.584 --> 27:50.045
Victoria said that Dominique's office
was in the Louvre.

27:50.128 --> 27:52.631
He had to have left
some kind of clue about the tablet.

27:52.798 --> 27:54.883
If we could just get in
to do some research...

27:55.050 --> 27:58.554
Got it! Dominique Vivant Denon.
Born January 4th, 1747.

27:58.637 --> 28:01.682
What? No. We need to know
where his office was,

28:01.765 --> 28:03.308
the sketch Victoria showed me.

28:03.392 --> 28:06.144
Bingo! Found the sketch.
Dominique's office.

28:06.311 --> 28:08.188
So can we go to Paris now?

28:08.397 --> 28:10.482
-There's just one problem.
-What?

28:10.566 --> 28:14.111
I'm broke. You've spent all my money.
How will we pay for the tickets?

28:14.361 --> 28:16.864
Tad, don't be so materialistic.

28:17.030 --> 28:18.991
We don't need money to travel.

28:23.537 --> 28:25.080
<i>Get your foot out of my face!</i>

28:25.289 --> 28:27.916
It's not my foot. It's my chicken.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.544
You brought your rubber chicken?

28:30.711 --> 28:34.381
He's got a name, okay? It's Chicken.
He might come in handy.

28:34.631 --> 28:35.966
Did you just bite me?

28:36.133 --> 28:37.843
I was just testing the Dracula thing.

28:45.309 --> 28:47.936
-Holy cow!
-My goodness!

28:48.020 --> 28:49.980
Who could have done something like this?

28:50.272 --> 28:52.191
I speak 50 languages

28:52.274 --> 28:55.194
and I still can't find the words
to describe this havoc!

28:57.863 --> 29:01.074
I was cleaning the brush for cleaning dust
with the brush for cleaning brushes

29:01.158 --> 29:03.076
when all of a sudden... Boom!

29:03.785 --> 29:05.787
Don't worry, we'll find out who did this.

29:06.455 --> 29:10.375
H.Q., this is Agent Ramirez.
Check the security tape for me, would you?

29:10.709 --> 29:13.921
The only thing I need to check here
is my cholesterol.

29:15.881 --> 29:17.132
Sorry. Who are you?

29:17.466 --> 29:21.136
CIA Special Agent Sam Pickle.
I'm in charge of this operation.

29:21.220 --> 29:22.221
And you?

29:22.304 --> 29:24.640
Guadalupe Ramirez,
Mexican Intelligence Service.

29:24.806 --> 29:28.644
And I am in charge of this.
Wait, this is a bowling club card.

29:28.727 --> 29:32.439
So what? You don't like bowling?
Hate everything American, is that it?

29:32.940 --> 29:34.608
Mexico's America, too.

29:34.942 --> 29:37.528
Yeah, right, and Chile, too. Come on.

29:37.694 --> 29:40.531
Hey, that's my badge! Give it back!
You have your own.

29:40.697 --> 29:42.866
Negative. It fell in the toilet.

29:50.541 --> 29:51.875
Belzoni?

29:52.459 --> 29:55.462
Your bosses gave me authority here.
Give me the badge and...

30:00.634 --> 30:02.219
Just as I suspected!

30:02.302 --> 30:04.304
We're dealing with an eight-year-old.

30:04.805 --> 30:05.931
Dear goodness.

30:06.890 --> 30:08.141
Excuse me.

30:08.642 --> 30:10.143
Do you know who this belongs to?

30:12.980 --> 30:14.690
I absolutely do.

30:21.780 --> 30:23.824
Hey, Tangerine, get in the car.

30:23.907 --> 30:25.659
You! What happened to Tad?

30:25.742 --> 30:27.661
I know where he is. Hurry!

30:28.662 --> 30:30.998
And don't call me Tangerine.

30:32.374 --> 30:35.169
I knew it. This is all your fault.

30:35.252 --> 30:37.337
I wasn't expecting Tad
to open the sarcophagus.

30:37.421 --> 30:39.464
I just encouraged him to persuade you.

30:39.548 --> 30:40.799
Where's Tad?

30:41.758 --> 30:43.302
Take me to your leader.

30:43.468 --> 30:44.970
Agent Pickle, check this out.

30:46.555 --> 30:49.349
This account was created
from the apartment of that Tad guy.

30:49.433 --> 30:51.435
<i>Hey, wassup, Mummy fans?</i>

30:51.518 --> 30:54.563
<i>We are going on an expedition</i>
<i>to the Louvre Museum.</i>

30:54.605 --> 30:56.607
<i>See you later, alligator.</i>

30:57.316 --> 31:01.528
He's wearing a costume
so we don't identify him. Professionals!

31:01.695 --> 31:03.363
Tad's in Paris?

31:03.447 --> 31:04.907
He's looking for the Emerald Tablet.

31:04.990 --> 31:07.367
We could look for it, too,
like the old days.

31:07.451 --> 31:09.995
Sara and Victoria,
investigators of history!

31:10.078 --> 31:13.457
That was before you swapped archaeology
for spirits and ghosts.

31:13.540 --> 31:16.126
Sara, I know we have
different views of the world, but...

31:16.210 --> 31:17.419
That's enough, Victoria.

31:17.503 --> 31:18.921
You, stop the car!

31:21.006 --> 31:23.008
Sara, wait. Where are you going?

31:23.091 --> 31:24.468
To look for Tad.

31:24.551 --> 31:26.178
I'm going to Paris.

31:29.306 --> 31:30.724
So, the Louvre, huh?

31:30.807 --> 31:33.977
Ramirez, pack your bags.
We're going to Rome!

31:34.061 --> 31:35.229
Paris.

31:35.979 --> 31:37.439
Paris, that's what I said.

31:37.523 --> 31:41.026
Come on, cheer up, buddy.
We'll be in croissant country in no time.

31:41.109 --> 31:44.404
You're not nervous, are you? 'Cause I am.

31:44.488 --> 31:46.949
-Oh, no.
-What? Are you transforming again?

31:47.032 --> 31:49.618
Worse. Nerves make me gassy.

32:22.901 --> 32:25.821
Cool. So you can buy mummies online now?

32:25.904 --> 32:27.197
You can get anything online now.

32:27.281 --> 32:29.867
Like this cup.
It stirs the café au lait by itself.

32:40.878 --> 32:43.088
I couldn't stand that anymore!

32:43.172 --> 32:45.591
I can't believe it! We're in Paris!

32:45.674 --> 32:46.925
It's beautiful.

32:52.764 --> 32:55.142
Okay, come on. No time to lose.

32:55.225 --> 32:57.561
The office should be
underneath the Egyptian wing.

32:58.395 --> 33:00.814
Hold your horses.
We're in the Louvre, okay?

33:00.898 --> 33:03.108
Now what do people do
when they go to the Louvre?

33:04.943 --> 33:07.404
Oh, boy. That look!

33:07.487 --> 33:09.907
Is it happy? Sad? Happy?

33:09.990 --> 33:12.659
Okay, fine, you've seen it now.
Lend me your phone.

33:22.878 --> 33:25.088
Come on, where are you? Where are you?

33:26.465 --> 33:29.384
There's got to be some trace
of an old office here somewhere.

34:00.290 --> 34:03.043
Tad? It's been three minutes
without my phone.

34:03.210 --> 34:05.796
Now give it back to me.
I think I'm getting the shakes.

34:05.963 --> 34:09.049
Come on, help me.
We have to move this statue.

34:10.467 --> 34:11.467
Look.

34:11.552 --> 34:13.136
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

34:13.303 --> 34:15.472
Sure I am. I wish we had Wi-Fi.

34:15.722 --> 34:18.976
No, I mean the pulley.
We can use it to access the entrance.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.143
But we'd have to take
some precise measurements...

34:21.228 --> 34:22.813
to calculate the force of the lever.

34:22.938 --> 34:24.815
There's no time for that, my friend!

34:24.898 --> 34:28.025
Let's...do it...faster!

34:28.110 --> 34:29.777
No, Mummy, stop!

34:30.445 --> 34:31.446
Boom!

34:31.612 --> 34:34.283
Now that's what I call teamwork.

34:34.616 --> 34:35.868
Cheese!

34:38.996 --> 34:42.206
You had to break it!
An ornamental pedestal!

34:42.373 --> 34:44.001
Well, it's open, right?

34:47.462 --> 34:51.382
It's pitch black in here.
I'm gonna trip over my own feet.

34:52.301 --> 34:53.844
Wait. There's something here.

34:58.098 --> 34:59.808
Yes, yes, yes!

34:59.892 --> 35:02.394
This is it! Dominique's office!

35:03.312 --> 35:05.689
The engraving has to be here somewhere.

35:05.856 --> 35:07.608
This place is huge!

35:07.774 --> 35:10.736
Not like your apartment,
where I'm clean out of box space.

35:10.819 --> 35:12.070
Help me look. Come on.

35:25.542 --> 35:27.211
I'm really good at that.

35:37.804 --> 35:41.225
The mummy from this sarcophagus
must've been a real high roller!

35:41.683 --> 35:43.101
I'm gonna take a selfie.

35:44.311 --> 35:46.563
That should get me a million likes.

36:01.370 --> 36:02.496
Tad!

36:02.579 --> 36:04.331
There's a mummy, and it's alive!

36:04.414 --> 36:05.916
-That's impossible!
-Stop it!

36:05.999 --> 36:09.002
I swear it was there. It opened its eyes
and shouted, "I'm gonna kill you!"

36:09.086 --> 36:11.255
Okay, it didn't shout that.
But it was right there!

36:11.421 --> 36:13.757
Silence, mortals!

36:14.091 --> 36:17.094
Bow down before your pharaoh,

36:17.261 --> 36:19.429
Queen of the 18th Dynasty,

36:19.513 --> 36:23.684
adviser to Queen Nefertiti,
aunt to Tutankhamun...

36:23.767 --> 36:28.397
I am Ra Amon Ah!

36:30.482 --> 36:31.483
Ramona?

36:32.734 --> 36:35.821
What? No, no, no. Ra Amon Ah.

36:36.154 --> 36:37.489
Wait. Let me do it again.

36:39.700 --> 36:43.370
Your pharaoh, 18th Dynasty,
aunt to Tutankhamun,

36:43.620 --> 36:46.123
Ra Amon Ah!

36:47.291 --> 36:50.460
-She just said Ramona, right?
-Sure did. Ramona.

36:50.711 --> 36:53.422
No, no! It's got pauses in it.

36:54.173 --> 36:55.674
Wait, you're dead.

36:55.841 --> 36:57.676
Absolutely. I'm a mummy.

36:57.885 --> 36:59.219
Don't make me laugh.

36:59.386 --> 37:02.389
But sure I am!
I'm an Incan mummy from Paititi.

37:02.472 --> 37:05.142
Even my name is Mummy. <i>Enchanté.</i>

37:05.309 --> 37:06.727
Mummies are only Egyptian.

37:06.810 --> 37:10.105
You're just a stack of rotting bones
and rancid bandages.

37:10.272 --> 37:11.899
Thanks. I get that a lot.

37:12.065 --> 37:14.693
What are you doing here?
And how come you're alive?

37:14.860 --> 37:18.238
Five centuries ago, a goat herder
who was passing through my tomb

37:18.322 --> 37:19.698
choked on a date kernel

37:19.865 --> 37:23.035
and inadvertently uttered a spell
that brought me back to life.

37:23.202 --> 37:25.621
Years later, a French archaeologist
discovered me

37:25.787 --> 37:28.582
and he left me locked up in here
for my own safety, he said.

37:28.749 --> 37:30.042
I feel you, sister.

37:30.125 --> 37:32.002
This guy had me shut in
for more than two months!

37:32.336 --> 37:33.837
200 years for me.

37:34.004 --> 37:35.339
-You win.
-Hang on.

37:35.422 --> 37:37.966
What French archaeologist?
Was it Dominique?

37:38.258 --> 37:40.844
Yes, but I'm sorry to tell you,
he died centuries ago.

37:41.136 --> 37:43.388
Yeah, we're looking for an engraving
he left hidden here.

37:43.472 --> 37:45.057
You couldn't lend us a hand, could you?

37:45.224 --> 37:46.642
Lend you a hand?

37:47.226 --> 37:50.229
What part of "pharaoh"
did you not understand?

37:53.106 --> 37:56.026
God Horus, forgive me, my lord.

37:56.360 --> 37:59.196
I am not worthy
of your magnificent presence.

38:01.782 --> 38:03.450
Exactly!

38:03.534 --> 38:06.286
This is indeed Horus himself.

38:06.954 --> 38:08.455
What's that you say, Horus?

38:09.540 --> 38:11.500
He orders you to help us.

38:12.376 --> 38:14.044
You must do everything we say.

38:18.632 --> 38:20.384
He's nothing but a flying mutt.

38:20.551 --> 38:23.971
My soldiers would have given you
50 lashes for that little charade.

38:24.054 --> 38:25.556
How I do miss them.

38:25.931 --> 38:27.266
Lash yourselves, then.

38:29.685 --> 38:33.647
I'm so sorry. It's just that my friends
are under a bit of a curse.

38:33.730 --> 38:35.232
-If you could just help me.
-Forget it.

38:35.315 --> 38:36.859
It's my bath time in rat's milk.

38:36.942 --> 38:39.862
I would prefer donkey bile,
but one must make sacrifices.

38:39.945 --> 38:43.699
Please. Without the engraving,
we'll never find the Emerald Tablet.

38:43.782 --> 38:46.618
The Emerald Tablet.
Are you an archaeologist?

38:46.869 --> 38:48.871
Tad Stones, this is the police!
Don't move!

38:49.037 --> 38:50.539
Hey, I'm running this operation.

38:50.706 --> 38:53.292
Tad Stones, this is the police!
Don't move!

38:53.625 --> 38:55.752
Are you an archaeologist, yes or no?

38:55.836 --> 38:59.006
He's the best archaeologist in the world!
He found me.

38:59.089 --> 39:00.132
Stones!

39:01.049 --> 39:02.050
Wait there!

39:02.759 --> 39:05.596
Here! Dominique built a way out. Hurry!

39:07.723 --> 39:09.391
Great! Quick, let's go.

39:09.474 --> 39:10.559
Hold on a minute.

39:10.726 --> 39:12.853
I'm not going without my tub.

39:12.936 --> 39:15.355
-What?
-Stones!

39:16.023 --> 39:17.733
Okay, everyone in the tub!

39:36.043 --> 39:38.462
Okay, plebeians, now take me out of here.

39:40.714 --> 39:42.090
Quick, don't let him escape!

39:46.595 --> 39:47.930
Stones!

39:48.347 --> 39:49.598
Better hurry, darling.

39:49.848 --> 39:51.058
He's mine.

39:52.559 --> 39:53.560
He's mine!

39:55.979 --> 39:57.356
He's mine!

39:57.940 --> 39:58.941
He's not mine.

39:59.024 --> 40:02.110
They're escaping down the river
in a motorized...bathtub?

40:02.194 --> 40:03.487
We need backup.

40:03.904 --> 40:05.572
I think we've lost them.

40:05.989 --> 40:07.199
You mean them?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.628
Put your foot down, Tad!
I'm too young for prison.

40:19.711 --> 40:21.213
Nobody's going to prison.

40:21.296 --> 40:23.131
Could you please look ahead, plebs?

40:30.305 --> 40:32.307
Stop that tub immediately!

40:39.189 --> 40:40.148
Watch out!

40:46.280 --> 40:48.365
<i>An historic moment in the final stage.</i>

40:48.448 --> 40:52.536
<i>At last, a Frenchman is set to win</i>
<i>the Tour after nearly 40 years!</i>

41:04.840 --> 41:08.260
<i>Come on, Jean Paul! The Tour is yours!</i>

41:12.598 --> 41:13.932
Who's this guy?

41:23.984 --> 41:28.030
<i>It is an honor to reinaugurate this symbol</i>
<i>of Paris and France herself.</i>

41:36.246 --> 41:37.331
At last!

41:37.956 --> 41:39.374
I think we lost them.

41:42.211 --> 41:45.088
Well, well, Mr. Stones, we meet again.

41:45.172 --> 41:47.382
No, not that guy again!

41:49.092 --> 41:51.011
Throwing down the gauntlet, are we?

41:51.094 --> 41:53.013
Driver, step on it.

41:53.096 --> 41:55.349
We can't get by them.
We have to turn back.

41:57.684 --> 42:00.270
Don't worry, Ramirez, he'll turn first.

42:01.563 --> 42:03.815
What? Are you <i>loco?</i> We're going to crash!

42:03.899 --> 42:05.901
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

42:08.320 --> 42:10.113
Exactly what I'm doing.

42:12.115 --> 42:14.243
I've never been more sure of anything.

42:21.667 --> 42:22.793
Good job, Pickle.

42:22.876 --> 42:25.712
I've got him exactly where I wanted him.

42:37.850 --> 42:39.226
Oh, I think he likes us!

42:44.606 --> 42:46.191
Sorry. Maybe next year.

42:57.119 --> 42:59.246
Did I say I miss my soldiers?

43:00.330 --> 43:03.083
Wait, what about the tablet?
We have to find it.

43:03.166 --> 43:04.960
Don't worry. I know how to get it.

43:05.043 --> 43:08.172
I'll help you if you do me a favor.

43:08.255 --> 43:09.548
Sure, anything.

43:10.007 --> 43:13.343
You're an archaeologist.
Well, make me famous.

43:13.760 --> 43:16.930
Make sure my name goes down
in all the history books.

43:17.014 --> 43:20.517
Exhibit me in a museum
and I'll take you to the tablet.

43:20.601 --> 43:21.810
Deal?

43:22.853 --> 43:23.854
Deal.

43:28.984 --> 43:30.485
Welcome to the team, buddy!

43:30.569 --> 43:31.653
Team?

43:31.737 --> 43:33.822
Let's be clear about this, darling.

43:33.906 --> 43:37.701
I am a pharaoh
and you are my paltry servants.

43:39.369 --> 43:42.998
Perfect! Dominique found a map
that leads to the tablet.

43:43.248 --> 43:44.625
A map? Cool!

43:44.708 --> 43:48.378
It's not that easy.
To reveal that map we need a key

43:48.462 --> 43:50.297
that's hidden
in the Cataracts of the Nile.

43:50.714 --> 43:53.050
Egypt. With the police
all over our trail...

43:53.217 --> 43:54.801
At least they don't know
where we're headed.

43:54.885 --> 43:56.720
We've got the element of surprise
on our side.

43:56.887 --> 44:00.891
You heard it here first, Mummy fans!
Next stop, Cataracts of the Nile.

44:00.974 --> 44:02.559
Let me introduce my team.

44:02.643 --> 44:05.729
We'll give you all the deets
of the trip real soon, everybody.

44:05.896 --> 44:07.606
And uploaded!

44:08.232 --> 44:11.193
It's exhausting always having to put on
a happy face for the Stories.

44:11.360 --> 44:12.653
What have you done?

44:12.736 --> 44:15.280
I'm just feeding the Instazammers.

44:15.822 --> 44:16.823
A new follower.

44:16.907 --> 44:19.409
Agent Ramirez. Mexican!
I'm gonna follow her back.

44:22.746 --> 44:23.956
No!

44:24.289 --> 44:26.208
They'll be waiting for us now!

44:26.375 --> 44:27.876
Oh, my selfies!

44:30.462 --> 44:32.130
The curse turns him into an Ammyt?

44:32.214 --> 44:33.215
What?

44:35.008 --> 44:37.386
Head of a crocodile, body of a leopard,

44:37.469 --> 44:40.222
backside of a hippo.
A typical underworld creature.

44:44.017 --> 44:46.728
No! Mummy, wait! Stop, stop, stop!

44:55.279 --> 44:56.947
Yep, it's an Ammyt.

44:57.114 --> 44:58.740
Be careful, they bite.

45:08.166 --> 45:09.334
Mummy?

45:11.753 --> 45:13.797
He can't hear you. He's an Ammyt now.

45:13.881 --> 45:15.340
So what do we do?

45:18.343 --> 45:19.595
Ammyts like to be entertained.

45:19.678 --> 45:21.680
But careful,
don't put your head into his mouth.

45:21.763 --> 45:24.266
Why would I want
to put my head into his mouth?

45:24.349 --> 45:28.020
Well, it's not what you want.
It's what he wants!

45:28.187 --> 45:29.980
Ammyts love playing with heads.

45:30.105 --> 45:31.356
What?

45:34.902 --> 45:36.987
Come on, darling. He's coming.

45:37.070 --> 45:40.866
-But how do I entertain an Ammyt?
-Just do anything.

45:43.035 --> 45:44.703
So, entertain him?

45:44.786 --> 45:46.788
Dancing... Dancing is entertaining.

45:49.124 --> 45:50.125
What the...

45:57.341 --> 45:58.717
What are you...

46:00.469 --> 46:03.180
He's gonna eat me. He's gonna eat me!

46:10.395 --> 46:12.856
Where's the chicken?
Where's the little chickie?

46:12.940 --> 46:14.274
That's my boy.

46:14.358 --> 46:15.943
Oh, good boy.

46:16.360 --> 46:17.569
Fetch!

46:20.030 --> 46:22.658
Monsters of the underworld.
They're just like puppies.

46:26.662 --> 46:28.622
He's turning back into Mummy.

46:29.957 --> 46:31.875
Well, at least most of him.

46:33.460 --> 46:35.212
What just happened?

46:36.964 --> 46:39.591
I don't usually meddle
in such plebeian matters,

46:39.675 --> 46:43.136
but these curses get permanent
if you don't cure them soon.

46:43.220 --> 46:45.848
You should get a move
on finding that tablet.

46:59.278 --> 47:02.698
Tad Stones strikes again.
First Chicago, now Paris.

47:02.781 --> 47:04.157
French police have joined the hunt

47:04.241 --> 47:06.785
for the dangerous criminal
known as Tad Stones.

47:06.869 --> 47:11.790
Vampires, zombies, extraterrestrials.
Do they live among us?

47:14.960 --> 47:17.963
Some people
just want to see the world burn.

47:20.174 --> 47:21.508
Pickle, you should see this.

47:21.675 --> 47:25.888
I want to nab that Stones so bad
and use the death touch on him.

47:26.388 --> 47:28.891
Listen, they're headed for
the Cataracts of the Nile.

47:28.974 --> 47:30.934
-We should notify...
-The death touch, Ramirez.

47:31.018 --> 47:33.353
It's the first thing
they teach you at the CIA.

47:33.437 --> 47:37.274
A little pinch direct to a vital organ
and the enemy drops unconscious.

47:37.357 --> 47:38.692
Would you listen to me?

47:38.984 --> 47:40.652
And you can't eat in here.

47:41.278 --> 47:42.613
Oh, really?

47:44.781 --> 47:45.908
Solved.

47:51.538 --> 47:53.165
<i>This is humiliating!</i>

47:53.248 --> 47:55.667
A pharaoh traveling with such commoners.

47:55.751 --> 47:58.545
So exciting!
We're going to the land of the mummies.

47:58.629 --> 48:00.047
I'm gonna feel right at home.

48:00.130 --> 48:02.966
For the fifth time, you are not a mummy!

48:03.133 --> 48:06.261
With a tail like that, you look more
like a crocodile of the Nile.

48:06.428 --> 48:07.429
Awesome!

48:22.444 --> 48:23.946
Come on, Tad,

48:24.279 --> 48:26.365
what were you looking for here?

48:37.543 --> 48:39.002
This symbol...

48:42.381 --> 48:44.174
It's the seal of Hermes.

48:44.258 --> 48:45.634
What are you doing here?

48:45.926 --> 48:48.762
I wasn't gonna leave
my best friend alone in this.

48:48.929 --> 48:50.055
Otto!

48:53.225 --> 48:56.311
Napoleon ordered all traces
of the tablet be destroyed

48:56.395 --> 48:58.105
but Dominique kept an engraving,

48:58.188 --> 49:00.774
and I'm sure it's here in this office.

49:02.359 --> 49:04.236
Why is Tad looking for the tablet?

49:04.403 --> 49:07.197
The sarcophagus he opened
was protected by a curse.

49:07.281 --> 49:08.615
He needs the tablet to break it.

49:08.699 --> 49:10.033
Tad's cursed?

49:10.117 --> 49:12.327
If we follow the tablet, we'll find him.

49:15.914 --> 49:17.416
I just want to help you.

49:25.924 --> 49:29.386
A location in the desert. In Egypt.

49:29.469 --> 49:32.598
That's it! The tablet is there!
That's where Tad is heading!

49:32.681 --> 49:34.266
He didn't find this clue.

49:34.349 --> 49:35.642
He found this office.

49:35.726 --> 49:38.604
I'm sure he must have discovered
another way of getting there.

49:41.106 --> 49:43.901
I think we're gonna need some help
with these hieroglyphics.

49:44.067 --> 49:46.445
I think you know who to call.

49:51.408 --> 49:54.620
Guys, we're going to Egypt!

49:56.747 --> 49:58.582
<i>And for your information,</i>

49:58.665 --> 50:00.709
Incas also have mummies.

50:00.792 --> 50:02.586
Well, I guess you are not one of them.

50:03.128 --> 50:04.838
Please, don't start again.

50:04.922 --> 50:08.217
I'm sorry, but this stuck-up old broad
is making me nervous.

50:08.300 --> 50:10.928
And when I get nervous, I... Oh, no.

50:11.803 --> 50:13.597
No. No. No!

50:16.642 --> 50:20.062
<i>Please fasten your seatbelts.</i>
<i>We're experiencing some turbulence.</i>

50:49.424 --> 50:50.843
You know,

50:51.260 --> 50:53.345
I've been thinking about it,

50:53.512 --> 50:56.682
and I can't bring to mind
any Pharaoh Ramona.

50:57.140 --> 50:59.226
That's because it's Ra Amon Ah.

51:00.060 --> 51:03.772
And nobody remembers me
because I only reigned for three days.

51:04.439 --> 51:06.400
Why? What happened?

51:07.025 --> 51:08.360
Well, you know,

51:08.443 --> 51:11.697
your typical jealous cousin
who puts a scorpion in your bed...

51:11.780 --> 51:13.198
so he can steal your throne.

51:14.116 --> 51:16.535
And nobody wrote your name
in the history books?

51:17.202 --> 51:21.206
Nothing but a line in one
of those interminable lists of pharaohs.

51:23.375 --> 51:27.379
I was destined to be
the greatest pharaoh of all time,

51:27.880 --> 51:30.424
but I ended up doomed to oblivion.

51:35.137 --> 51:36.722
I know how you feel.

51:38.307 --> 51:40.559
What would you know, plebeian?

51:43.395 --> 51:46.190
Get ready. We're getting close now.

52:12.966 --> 52:14.885
OMG. That's lit!

52:19.264 --> 52:20.891
So where's the key buried?

52:20.974 --> 52:24.645
The key isn't buried.
It's in the cave behind the waterfall.

52:24.728 --> 52:27.731
Don't worry, buddy.
We'll find it in no time.

52:27.814 --> 52:31.109
No, you stay here, okay?
You've done enough already.

52:38.742 --> 52:41.828
Life is such a drag
without your cell phone.

53:19.199 --> 53:20.367
What?

53:33.797 --> 53:36.091
Well, Sara, Freaktoria,

53:36.758 --> 53:40.304
according to the symbols,
this is the place.

53:41.388 --> 53:43.140
We did it, Tangerine.

53:46.268 --> 53:47.269
Hey!

53:48.145 --> 53:50.189
Are you sure this is a key?

53:52.524 --> 53:54.484
<i>Tad Stones! Don't move!</i>

53:56.028 --> 53:57.154
Come on.

53:57.613 --> 54:02.159
Look, this has been
a big misunderstanding. I'm innocent.

54:02.242 --> 54:06.288
<i>We know. Don't worry. Come with us</i>
<i>and we'll clear everything up.</i>

54:07.706 --> 54:11.543
<i>He's taking the bait.</i>
<i>That crook is gonna rot in jail.</i>

54:11.627 --> 54:13.295
Your megaphone is still on.

54:13.754 --> 54:17.633
<i>What? What do you mean,</i>
<i>my megaphone is... Mother of...</i>

54:18.842 --> 54:20.302
Open fire!

54:21.803 --> 54:23.514
-Take cover!
-Let's go!

54:25.140 --> 54:29.061
No! Stop, don't shoot! Hold your fire!
We just want to detain him.

54:30.354 --> 54:33.023
Tad, come out
and I promise you a fair trial.

54:33.106 --> 54:36.068
Fair, my backside!
He destroyed the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

54:36.151 --> 54:38.028
What did you do to the Mona Lisa?

54:38.111 --> 54:41.240
I fixed it.
All that ambiguity was unbearable.

54:41.323 --> 54:45.327
You destroyed the most important
piece of art in history?

54:47.037 --> 54:49.873
I'm sick of this! This is all your fault.

54:49.957 --> 54:52.543
If you had just stayed at home,
none of this would have happened.

54:52.709 --> 54:55.379
-But we're a team.
-We're not a team!

54:55.546 --> 54:58.799
You're only here because I have to break
that curse and cure you.

54:58.966 --> 55:02.845
If it wasn't for you, I'd be on
a real expedition looking for the tablet.

55:03.011 --> 55:04.346
You're just a burden!

55:06.265 --> 55:08.267
There, now you've done it.

55:09.393 --> 55:10.602
Now what's going on?

55:16.400 --> 55:17.401
What the...

55:23.198 --> 55:24.992
No, no, not now!

55:25.868 --> 55:29.037
Yes, now!
He's our ticket out of here. Hurry!

55:46.054 --> 55:47.347
What the hell was that?

55:47.514 --> 55:50.184
It's an alien. The flying kind.

55:50.684 --> 55:53.520
No one has discovered alien life.

55:53.687 --> 55:56.064
<i>That's what they want you to think.</i>

56:01.445 --> 56:03.030
How do you stop this thing?

56:03.113 --> 56:06.283
It's not an elephant. You can't stop it.

56:11.288 --> 56:13.790
Come on, guys, let's hit these babies.

56:14.833 --> 56:17.920
I'm not sure about this.
There's no sign of Tad here.

56:18.086 --> 56:20.964
The fragment shines like never before.
It has to be here.

56:21.048 --> 56:23.050
Tangerine, I can feel it!

56:25.928 --> 56:27.137
Sorry, wrong chakra.

56:32.809 --> 56:34.228
We're losing altitude!

56:36.480 --> 56:37.481
I don't get it.

56:37.564 --> 56:41.276
Why didn't Sara tell us
Victoria was on the expedition?

56:41.443 --> 56:44.821
Because we wouldn't be here.
She's completely nuts.

56:44.905 --> 56:47.533
If we find the tablet,
let's keep it away from her

56:47.616 --> 56:50.619
or she'll invoke some freak spirit
to kick our butts.

56:52.704 --> 56:54.581
Victoria found the clue
that brought us here.

56:54.665 --> 56:56.708
You should show a bit more respect.

56:56.792 --> 57:00.170
Sara, you know we would do anything
for a decent discovery,

57:00.254 --> 57:01.797
but we don't trust her.

57:01.880 --> 57:03.465
This is gonna be a waste of time.

57:03.549 --> 57:07.177
I know I'm right.
The tablet is in there, right, Tangerine?

57:07.928 --> 57:10.764
We'll know when we see
what's behind that rock.

57:23.277 --> 57:24.444
So where's the tablet?

57:24.528 --> 57:26.989
As I said, it's all a waste of time.

57:27.072 --> 57:29.283
No, I don't understand it.

57:29.366 --> 57:32.077
It's the place that Dominique said.
There must be something here.

57:32.160 --> 57:34.288
That's what happens
when you listen to someone

57:34.371 --> 57:37.583
who thinks she can have coffee
and a chat with Christopher Columbus.

57:41.753 --> 57:42.754
Nothing.

57:42.838 --> 57:45.215
Perfect. Thanks for nothing!

57:45.799 --> 57:48.051
No, no, no. This can't be right.

57:54.558 --> 57:56.602
No, no! Slower!

57:56.685 --> 57:58.187
We're gonna crash!

57:58.270 --> 57:59.730
Hold on!

58:05.986 --> 58:08.864
I am never flying again.

58:10.365 --> 58:11.533
Everyone okay?

58:11.909 --> 58:14.745
I've had better days. But also worse ones.

58:14.828 --> 58:16.455
All of them with you.

58:17.706 --> 58:18.749
Where's Mummy?

58:20.709 --> 58:21.710
Mummy!

58:21.793 --> 58:23.837
Mummy. Mummy, are you okay?

58:24.463 --> 58:26.173
What happened?

58:27.049 --> 58:29.468
My legs! My beautiful dancer's legs!

58:35.224 --> 58:37.684
Don't worry, Beljeff.
You'll get your body back soon.

58:38.101 --> 58:39.937
Come on, Mummy, there's no time to...

58:42.481 --> 58:43.565
Mummy?

58:43.899 --> 58:45.943
I'm leaving! Enough!

58:46.026 --> 58:49.530
I don't want to be a "burden" on anyone!

58:49.613 --> 58:53.033
No! I'm gonna look for the tablet myself!

58:53.116 --> 58:55.035
Wait! Hold on!

58:55.118 --> 58:57.871
I didn't mean what I said before. Really.

58:59.790 --> 59:03.126
Hey, where do you think you're going?
We had a deal.

59:03.210 --> 59:06.213
Look, darling, I don't think
you can hold up your end of the bargain.

59:06.296 --> 59:10.926
No! You can't leave us stranded here.
We don't even know how to use this.

59:11.009 --> 59:14.763
As Osiris said to Horus,
"If you see me, don't say hi".

59:18.642 --> 59:21.228
Do it for Mummy. Please.

59:34.324 --> 59:35.534
We're near.

59:42.332 --> 59:45.252
How is that possible?
They're all here together.

59:45.335 --> 59:47.588
That's where the prism
will reveal the map.

59:47.671 --> 59:50.382
The monster brought us
where we have to use the prism?

59:50.465 --> 59:52.009
This can't be a coincidence.

59:52.092 --> 59:54.011
So I'm a monster now.

59:54.553 --> 59:56.346
No, not "Shh!"

59:56.638 --> 1:00:01.393
The tablet wants to be found, darling.
It will manipulate anyone to do just that.

1:00:02.269 --> 1:00:04.354
I need to enter that cave.

1:00:05.147 --> 1:00:06.231
Oh, really?

1:00:06.315 --> 1:00:09.109
And how do you intend to do that?
Those guys hate you.

1:00:09.193 --> 1:00:11.361
They hate you, too?
How many lashes are you owed?

1:00:11.445 --> 1:00:13.739
They'll call the cops
the minute they lay eyes on you.

1:00:13.822 --> 1:00:15.532
Will you just listen?

1:00:15.616 --> 1:00:18.035
We need to distract them
to get in that cave.

1:00:20.913 --> 1:00:23.332
I've got an idea.
But we'll have to work as a team.

1:00:24.499 --> 1:00:26.126
So we're a team now.

1:00:26.210 --> 1:00:29.421
Well, I can't. I'm not feeling good.
I have a cough.

1:00:30.839 --> 1:00:32.674
You do get to go in disguise.

1:00:34.009 --> 1:00:35.052
Go on.

1:00:35.135 --> 1:00:36.970
Count me out. That's not for me, darling.

1:00:37.054 --> 1:00:40.807
Those guys are the most
prestigious archaeologists in the world.

1:00:40.891 --> 1:00:44.102
How do you think they'll react
when they set eyes on the lost pharaoh?

1:00:44.895 --> 1:00:45.896
Go on.

1:00:45.979 --> 1:00:47.439
The most important thing:

1:00:47.523 --> 1:00:50.817
No matter what happens,
don't let anyone see you move.

1:00:53.111 --> 1:00:54.571
Come on, come on!

1:00:54.821 --> 1:00:56.823
There's got to be something we're missing.

1:00:56.990 --> 1:00:58.909
Okay, guys, we're leaving.

1:00:59.368 --> 1:01:03.163
I am gonna make sure
that the whole world knows you're a fraud.

1:01:03.914 --> 1:01:06.333
Guys, did anyone order pizza?

1:01:11.588 --> 1:01:14.800
Hello, hello, friends! How are you all?

1:01:14.967 --> 1:01:16.969
I am a desert bedbug.

1:01:17.052 --> 1:01:18.053
Bedouin.

1:01:18.804 --> 1:01:19.847
Bedouin.

1:01:19.930 --> 1:01:24.184
I have been wandering many miles,
accompanied only by my parrot.

1:01:26.937 --> 1:01:27.980
My dog.

1:01:29.273 --> 1:01:30.899
You're archaeologists.

1:01:31.066 --> 1:01:32.860
What an unexpected coincidence.

1:01:32.943 --> 1:01:36.363
Perhaps you may be interested
in my great find.

1:01:36.446 --> 1:01:38.824
The Queen of the 18th Dynasty,

1:01:38.907 --> 1:01:43.287
adviser to Queen Nefertiti,
aunt to Tutankhamun...

1:01:43.370 --> 1:01:47.040
Ra Amon Ah!

1:01:48.709 --> 1:01:49.793
Ramona?

1:01:49.877 --> 1:01:52.713
No, no, no.
Ramona only to her closest friends.

1:01:52.796 --> 1:01:55.632
It is Ra Amon Ah. It's got pauses in it.

1:01:57.259 --> 1:01:58.927
What do we have here?

1:02:01.180 --> 1:02:04.016
Looks like the seal
of the 18th Dynasty, right, guys?

1:02:04.099 --> 1:02:05.434
-Yeah, sure.
-Mind-blowing!

1:02:05.517 --> 1:02:06.727
And look at those ornaments!

1:02:13.275 --> 1:02:14.359
Tad?

1:02:16.278 --> 1:02:18.071
Sara, what are you doing here?

1:02:18.155 --> 1:02:20.782
I've been looking
across half the world for you.

1:02:20.949 --> 1:02:23.118
Are you okay? Did the curse infect you?

1:02:23.202 --> 1:02:27.122
No, it's not me, Sara,
but the curse hit Mummy and Beljeff.

1:02:27.372 --> 1:02:30.125
-Beljeff?
-That's a long story.

1:02:30.209 --> 1:02:33.045
But look, Sara, with this prism
we'll be able to find...

1:02:33.128 --> 1:02:34.546
The Emerald Tablet!

1:02:35.047 --> 1:02:36.256
It's a key!

1:02:56.777 --> 1:02:58.403
Sara, the map!

1:03:01.782 --> 1:03:03.575
There's the Emerald Tablet!

1:03:03.659 --> 1:03:05.202
In the Great Pyramid?

1:03:05.369 --> 1:03:08.288
Underneath it.
Cheops built it to cover it.

1:03:08.372 --> 1:03:11.375
The pyramid isn't a tomb, it's a slab.

1:03:13.085 --> 1:03:15.087
Tad, this is an amazing discovery.

1:03:15.170 --> 1:03:16.839
It's your discovery.

1:03:18.924 --> 1:03:22.553
You're right. This is my discovery.

1:03:23.762 --> 1:03:24.847
Tad?

1:03:25.597 --> 1:03:28.100
And if you take this jewel of the Nile,

1:03:28.183 --> 1:03:30.352
I will gladly throw in a light saber.

1:03:30.435 --> 1:03:31.520
Hey!

1:03:32.813 --> 1:03:33.939
What's up, guys?

1:03:35.524 --> 1:03:37.150
But what are you do...

1:03:37.234 --> 1:03:41.113
What are you doing here,
stranger who I do not know at all?

1:03:41.196 --> 1:03:43.991
Anyone here
looking for the Emerald Tablet?

1:03:45.909 --> 1:03:48.203
You've got some nerve
showing up here, buddy!

1:03:48.287 --> 1:03:49.538
Call the cops.

1:03:49.746 --> 1:03:51.290
No, guys, wait!

1:03:51.373 --> 1:03:53.166
How do you call the cops here? Is it 911?

1:03:53.250 --> 1:03:55.127
What? No, that's in the U.S.!

1:03:55.210 --> 1:03:57.796
Guys, I found the map. The tablet is real!

1:03:57.880 --> 1:03:59.339
But what are you doing?

1:03:59.423 --> 1:04:01.466
Hey, who on earth are you?

1:04:05.387 --> 1:04:06.930
What's that? Gross!

1:04:07.014 --> 1:04:09.057
Hey, show some respect, you little brat.

1:04:09.141 --> 1:04:10.934
Hey, who you calling a brat?

1:04:11.018 --> 1:04:13.729
Got it. Hello, police?
We have Tad, the terrorist.

1:04:13.812 --> 1:04:17.399
I'm a cursed 500-year-old mummy,
so respect your elders.

1:04:17.482 --> 1:04:18.525
Stop it!

1:04:19.776 --> 1:04:21.278
Tad's telling the truth.

1:04:21.361 --> 1:04:23.572
Get in and see for yourselves.

1:04:27.075 --> 1:04:29.328
-It's true.
-The map.

1:04:30.329 --> 1:04:33.040
Can we get it now? Something's wrong.

1:04:33.123 --> 1:04:35.292
Let's move, guys.
We need to get the tablet.

1:04:35.375 --> 1:04:38.962
You're not going anywhere, Stones!
You're still a danger to archaeology.

1:04:39.046 --> 1:04:40.464
The police are on their way.

1:04:40.547 --> 1:04:42.299
But we need to cure my friend.

1:04:42.382 --> 1:04:46.094
I'm afraid this is the end of the journey
for all of you.

1:04:46.178 --> 1:04:47.262
What?

1:04:47.346 --> 1:04:51.767
Your friend will be the first being
of the new world that I shall rule

1:04:51.850 --> 1:04:53.936
once I have the Emerald Tablet.

1:04:54.019 --> 1:04:56.355
Okay, that's it, Freaktoria.

1:04:57.523 --> 1:05:02.861
I shall fill the cities with spirits,
fantastical creatures, spells.

1:05:02.945 --> 1:05:05.405
And then all of you shall be the freaks.

1:05:05.489 --> 1:05:06.657
Victoria.

1:05:06.740 --> 1:05:09.201
It's not her, Sara.
The tablet has possessed her!

1:05:09.284 --> 1:05:10.911
-What?
-The piece on the diary.

1:05:10.994 --> 1:05:13.705
Nobody will ever laugh at Victoria Moon!

1:05:13.789 --> 1:05:14.831
Don't let them escape!

1:05:21.797 --> 1:05:22.923
No, no, no!

1:05:24.132 --> 1:05:25.133
Help me!

1:05:28.470 --> 1:05:31.473
What I wouldn't give
for some scarab beetle hummus.

1:05:36.478 --> 1:05:38.605
Ensure they don't get away.

1:05:44.403 --> 1:05:45.988
Come on, help me!

1:05:46.446 --> 1:05:48.574
Come on, guys. Brushes, quick!

1:05:48.866 --> 1:05:52.244
Brush for dust. Brush for sand.
Brush for rocks.

1:05:52.327 --> 1:05:54.746
Enough with the brushes!
Just move the rocks!

1:05:54.830 --> 1:05:56.999
-Okay, okay!
-He's so bossy.

1:06:07.134 --> 1:06:08.802
Hurry, we're nearly there.

1:06:13.390 --> 1:06:14.474
Don't move, Tad.

1:06:23.525 --> 1:06:26.612
It's dark, oh, it's so dark...

1:06:26.695 --> 1:06:28.363
Please be careful with him.

1:06:28.447 --> 1:06:30.949
Well, well, the gang are all here.

1:06:31.033 --> 1:06:32.451
This is a big mistake. You have...

1:06:32.534 --> 1:06:35.120
Robbing mummies
from the Egyptian government, huh?

1:06:35.204 --> 1:06:36.914
Checkmate, Mr. Stones.

1:06:36.997 --> 1:06:40.626
Or should I say Alien Stones?

1:06:40.709 --> 1:06:41.793
Please, just listen to me.

1:06:41.877 --> 1:06:46.507
You thought you'd get away with it,
but you forgot my superior intelligence.

1:06:46.590 --> 1:06:49.843
And an anonymous phone call
from this guy that tipped you off.

1:06:49.927 --> 1:06:51.094
That, too.

1:06:51.178 --> 1:06:52.179
That was us!

1:06:52.262 --> 1:06:53.639
Listen, there's a crazy lady

1:06:53.722 --> 1:06:55.682
that's gonna cause
the end of the world as we know it!

1:06:55.766 --> 1:06:58.352
Silence! Or I'll give you all
the death touch.

1:06:58.435 --> 1:07:00.354
Take that mummy to the museum in Athens.

1:07:00.437 --> 1:07:02.731
-Cairo.
-Well, that's what I said.

1:07:02.814 --> 1:07:04.566
And the rest, lock them all up!

1:07:04.650 --> 1:07:06.109
Including that guy in the disguise.

1:07:06.777 --> 1:07:08.529
Not this one. He looks nice.

1:07:08.612 --> 1:07:10.364
Okay, let's get moving!

1:07:11.114 --> 1:07:13.075
They can't arrest us now, Sara.

1:07:13.158 --> 1:07:16.370
Don't do anything now, Tad.
Not until we get to explain all this.

1:07:16.453 --> 1:07:18.664
Mummy doesn't have that much time left.

1:07:18.747 --> 1:07:20.040
Tad!

1:07:20.123 --> 1:07:23.377
You have to release us!
The end of the world is nigh!

1:07:23.460 --> 1:07:25.212
-Mummy! Let him go!
-Get back over here.

1:07:25.295 --> 1:07:27.506
Mummy, I'm gonna save you, you hear me?

1:07:27.589 --> 1:07:28.924
I'm gonna save you!

1:07:29.007 --> 1:07:31.051
Please, I have to save my friend.

1:07:33.053 --> 1:07:34.137
Mummy!

1:07:48.777 --> 1:07:52.781
What is it, darling? Haven't you
ever seen a living mummy before?

1:07:54.241 --> 1:07:56.076
You're Ra Amon Ah.

1:07:56.535 --> 1:07:58.787
Queen of the 18th Dynasty.

1:08:05.002 --> 1:08:07.588
I can't breathe.

1:08:09.089 --> 1:08:10.090
Sorry.

1:08:12.050 --> 1:08:14.219
-My head.
-Tad, are you okay?

1:08:15.304 --> 1:08:17.930
Yeah. What about Mummy?

1:08:19.183 --> 1:08:21.602
He's getting worse and worse.

1:08:26.314 --> 1:08:30.569
Let's move. We have to get out of here
and find the tablet before it's too late.

1:08:31.361 --> 1:08:32.362
No.

1:08:33.822 --> 1:08:34.907
Go without me.

1:08:35.532 --> 1:08:36.575
What?

1:08:37.783 --> 1:08:40.787
I'm not just a danger to archaeology,

1:08:41.246 --> 1:08:43.790
I'm a danger to everyone around me.

1:08:43.874 --> 1:08:45.334
That's not true.

1:08:45.834 --> 1:08:49.921
If I hadn't got obsessed with showing
what a great archaeologist I am,

1:08:50.589 --> 1:08:52.424
we wouldn't even be in this mess.

1:08:54.343 --> 1:08:56.886
I'm only good
for getting people in trouble.

1:08:57.513 --> 1:08:59.723
It's better I stay locked up in here.

1:09:08.273 --> 1:09:09.691
You're...

1:09:17.366 --> 1:09:18.867
You're

1:09:19.283 --> 1:09:20.536
the best

1:09:21.161 --> 1:09:23.497
archaeologist

1:09:23.913 --> 1:09:25.916
in the world.

1:09:27.125 --> 1:09:29.336
You found me.

1:09:38.679 --> 1:09:39.680
Mummy,

1:09:40.721 --> 1:09:42.099
please forgive me.

1:09:42.515 --> 1:09:45.519
Tad, I already did.

1:09:46.770 --> 1:09:48.104
Not for that.

1:09:50.482 --> 1:09:51.692
For this.

1:09:55.737 --> 1:09:57.322
Come on, we have to turn back!

1:09:57.406 --> 1:10:00.242
She's actually gonna
invoke a monster to kick our butts!

1:10:00.325 --> 1:10:02.911
This sounds very weird.
We should interrogate them, Pickle.

1:10:02.995 --> 1:10:04.997
They're trying to
twist your mind, Ramirez.

1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:06.456
Don't buy all that.

1:10:10.586 --> 1:10:11.837
What the...

1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:27.895
Hold on, Mummy!

1:10:28.312 --> 1:10:29.563
Quick, Tad!

1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:35.027
Get in! There's no time!

1:10:36.278 --> 1:10:40.240
They're going to give me
my very own room in the museum at Cairo.

1:10:40.324 --> 1:10:42.826
What? You can't leave us now.

1:10:42.910 --> 1:10:45.954
I've been waiting 3,000 years
for this moment.

1:10:46.038 --> 1:10:48.040
You know how much this means.

1:10:49.583 --> 1:10:51.919
Quickly! You have to cure Mummy.

1:10:55.088 --> 1:10:58.217
Remember, don't let anyone see you move.

1:11:01.011 --> 1:11:04.723
Best of luck, Ra Amon Ah.

1:11:14.274 --> 1:11:17.110
"Freaktoria is nuts.
She's nothing but a freak."

1:11:17.194 --> 1:11:19.571
Well, this freak
is gonna teach them a lesson.

1:11:19.655 --> 1:11:21.573
They're gonna give me
the respect I deserve.

1:11:24.868 --> 1:11:27.329
Ramona said the tablet wants to be found.

1:11:27.412 --> 1:11:29.665
It's using Victoria to come back to life.

1:11:29.748 --> 1:11:32.251
-Where did she go?
-There. Look.

1:11:59.111 --> 1:12:00.279
Yes. Yes!

1:12:00.362 --> 1:12:01.864
Fight it, Victoria!

1:12:02.030 --> 1:12:03.657
The tablet has got inside you.

1:12:03.740 --> 1:12:06.034
I will not let you take it from me!

1:12:06.118 --> 1:12:07.244
No, wait!

1:12:07.369 --> 1:12:08.704
It's mine!

1:12:10.914 --> 1:12:11.915
Victoria!

1:12:20.716 --> 1:12:22.551
-We did it.
-Let's move on.

1:12:23.010 --> 1:12:25.470
I feel my stomach's
all tangled up with my lungs.

1:12:25.554 --> 1:12:26.889
That's not good, right?

1:12:26.972 --> 1:12:28.849
We should nearly be there by now, Mummy.

1:12:28.932 --> 1:12:30.517
This doesn't seem too...

1:12:30.976 --> 1:12:32.102
...big.

1:12:37.816 --> 1:12:39.776
How are we gonna find the tablet?

1:12:41.820 --> 1:12:42.905
It's there.

1:12:49.661 --> 1:12:51.079
I see a bright light.

1:12:51.455 --> 1:12:54.208
Game over. Look after Antonio for me.

1:12:54.374 --> 1:12:55.584
Hold on, buddy.

1:12:59.713 --> 1:13:01.548
Tad, there. The altar.

1:13:01.632 --> 1:13:03.842
-Finally, Mummy.
-Yay.

1:13:09.223 --> 1:13:10.891
It's not here!

1:13:10.974 --> 1:13:12.809
Looking for something?

1:13:14.144 --> 1:13:18.190
This tablet was last used 4,000 years ago.

1:13:20.484 --> 1:13:24.154
Today, at long last, it's free once more.

1:13:24.404 --> 1:13:25.614
Victoria!

1:13:28.492 --> 1:13:30.160
That's very cool.

1:13:30.744 --> 1:13:35.749
Come forth into the light,
beings from the underworld!

1:13:40.838 --> 1:13:42.965
Please, we need to cure our friend.

1:13:43.048 --> 1:13:45.259
He's not your friend anymore.

1:13:46.051 --> 1:13:49.263
Complete your transformation!

1:14:06.530 --> 1:14:07.531
Mummy!

1:14:07.739 --> 1:14:09.157
Finish them!

1:14:09.950 --> 1:14:13.704
Buddy. Buddy! It's me, Tad,
your favorite archaeologist!

1:14:31.638 --> 1:14:33.807
He's out of control! What do we do?

1:14:33.891 --> 1:14:35.726
We can't help him without the tablet.

1:14:42.232 --> 1:14:43.817
Come to me,

1:14:43.901 --> 1:14:47.070
monsters of the underworld.

1:14:57.497 --> 1:14:59.124
What's up, plebeians?

1:14:59.208 --> 1:15:00.375
Ramona!

1:15:00.459 --> 1:15:02.920
Here, doggy, look what I've got!

1:15:03.378 --> 1:15:05.047
Come here, big guy.

1:15:05.214 --> 1:15:06.215
Fetch!

1:15:10.010 --> 1:15:12.429
No, not me! The chicken!

1:15:13.305 --> 1:15:14.806
Quick, Ramona, run!

1:15:17.100 --> 1:15:18.101
She's not gonna make it.

1:15:19.811 --> 1:15:20.896
Help me, Sara!

1:15:44.461 --> 1:15:45.462
No!

1:15:45.546 --> 1:15:47.881
-Victoria.
-What... What happened?

1:15:52.135 --> 1:15:53.679
Beljeff, no!

1:15:55.597 --> 1:15:57.766
Easy now, boy. Easy.

1:15:59.017 --> 1:16:01.812
Now he's gonna eat me!
Now he's gonna eat me!

1:16:08.986 --> 1:16:10.487
No!

1:16:15.242 --> 1:16:17.870
Mummy!

1:16:26.003 --> 1:16:28.505
No!

1:16:49.818 --> 1:16:51.612
Yes, we're just coming in now.

1:16:51.695 --> 1:16:54.323
It's just that Tad
took two hours getting ready.

1:16:54.781 --> 1:16:57.159
Sorry, I thought it was black tie.

1:16:57.242 --> 1:17:00.662
Relax. Today is your day,
and you should just enjoy it.

1:17:00.746 --> 1:17:03.207
Hey, who's this fine gentleman?

1:17:03.290 --> 1:17:05.709
Come on, don't be silly. Is Sara here yet?

1:17:05.792 --> 1:17:07.127
Come on, we're up.

1:17:07.211 --> 1:17:09.338
-See you out there, buddy.
<i>-Let's start by giving a very warm welcome</i>

1:17:09.421 --> 1:17:10.797
<i>to the rest of the team.</i>

1:17:14.843 --> 1:17:15.844
Breathe, Tad.

1:17:15.928 --> 1:17:19.765
This time you've actually done it,
for the whole world to see.

1:17:22.392 --> 1:17:27.856
<i>My friends, this discovery will change</i>
<i>the course of archaeology forever.</i>

1:17:28.273 --> 1:17:30.484
<i>The fact that we are here today</i>

1:17:30.526 --> 1:17:33.570
<i>is all down to someone</i>
<i>who never lost hope.</i>

1:17:34.112 --> 1:17:37.950
<i>I might even say</i>
<i>he's the best archaeologist I know.</i>

1:17:39.243 --> 1:17:42.579
<i>That is why I would like you all</i>
<i>to give a big round of applause</i>

1:17:42.663 --> 1:17:44.623
to the newest member of our team:

1:17:44.706 --> 1:17:47.501
<i>Dr. Tad Stones!</i>

1:17:54.049 --> 1:17:55.634
You did it, man.

1:18:02.224 --> 1:18:03.225
<i>I...</i>

1:18:09.565 --> 1:18:11.400
Tad, are you okay?

1:18:12.192 --> 1:18:13.235
Guys,

1:18:13.318 --> 1:18:15.571
where's Sara? And Ramona?

1:18:15.988 --> 1:18:18.991
Don't worry about them now.
You're with us, buddy.

1:18:21.034 --> 1:18:23.203
Where's Mummy?

1:18:23.954 --> 1:18:24.955
Mummy?

1:18:25.455 --> 1:18:28.458
Tad, Mummy fell into the abyss.

1:18:28.542 --> 1:18:30.169
He's gone.

1:18:33.088 --> 1:18:34.381
This isn't right.

1:18:35.549 --> 1:18:36.717
This isn't right.

1:18:37.301 --> 1:18:38.385
This isn't right.

1:18:41.430 --> 1:18:45.475
This isn't right, this isn't right,
this isn't right!

1:18:49.313 --> 1:18:51.190
But why isn't he doing anything?

1:18:51.273 --> 1:18:53.650
The tablet poisons your deepest desires.

1:18:53.734 --> 1:18:55.068
It's taking hold of him.

1:18:56.862 --> 1:18:58.280
Fight, Tad!

1:19:05.037 --> 1:19:07.122
Get out of my head!

1:19:43.951 --> 1:19:45.619
Hey, buddy.

1:19:46.453 --> 1:19:47.538
Hey, friend.

1:19:51.250 --> 1:19:53.669
Jeff, pal, you're cured!

1:19:59.883 --> 1:20:00.968
Let's get out of here.

1:20:09.017 --> 1:20:11.019
-We got to run, right?
-Yep.

1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:35.085
Cool! Hey, look. Quick, quick!

1:20:35.169 --> 1:20:36.712
Somebody get a photo, come on.

1:20:36.795 --> 1:20:40.132
This one's gonna be a huge hit
with my Instazammers.

1:20:40.215 --> 1:20:42.968
Okay, okay, I get it. I'll stop it now.

1:20:43.802 --> 1:20:44.803
What?

1:20:47.890 --> 1:20:51.894
Sara, I don't know how to apologize.
I didn't...

1:20:56.315 --> 1:20:58.275
Oh, how I miss my soldiers.

1:20:58.358 --> 1:21:00.569
They all worshipped me whenever I wanted.

1:21:03.864 --> 1:21:05.490
Stones!

1:21:07.117 --> 1:21:08.160
Halt!

1:21:08.243 --> 1:21:10.037
Start getting the cuffs on!

1:21:10.454 --> 1:21:13.624
Take me, but please leave my friends.
They haven't done anything.

1:21:13.707 --> 1:21:15.667
Not a word, Stones. You're under arre...

1:21:15.751 --> 1:21:17.669
Free. You're free to go.

1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:19.421
-What?
-What?

1:21:19.713 --> 1:21:21.298
Your colleagues explained it all.

1:21:21.381 --> 1:21:23.926
The sarcophagus, the curse, the mummies.

1:21:24.593 --> 1:21:26.845
-Where's the tablet?
-Destroyed.

1:21:26.929 --> 1:21:29.598
Perfect. That object
was far too dangerous.

1:21:29.681 --> 1:21:32.518
Promise me you'll never
breathe a word of this.

1:21:35.479 --> 1:21:36.480
I promise.

1:21:37.940 --> 1:21:39.900
No way! I'm in charge here,

1:21:39.983 --> 1:21:42.110
and that man
is an international terrorist!

1:21:42.194 --> 1:21:45.405
Tad Stones, you are under arrest
in the name of the government of...

1:21:48.825 --> 1:21:50.661
Death touch. Never fails.

1:21:50.786 --> 1:21:51.954
Hey, Stones!

1:21:52.371 --> 1:21:54.873
We still have to find
the treasure of King Pakal.

1:21:54.957 --> 1:21:57.793
-What do you say? Are you in?
-Yeah, come on, buddy.

1:21:58.335 --> 1:22:01.547
Thanks, guys,
but I've got plans with my team.

1:22:02.714 --> 1:22:05.551
Look after them. They're a great team.

1:22:10.097 --> 1:22:12.182
I don't get why you didn't stay.

1:22:12.266 --> 1:22:15.060
It was your opportunity
to be showcased in a museum.

1:22:15.143 --> 1:22:17.938
I know, darling,
it's where a goddess like me should be.

1:22:17.980 --> 1:22:21.900
But who wants to be locked up again?
Now I want to see the world!

1:22:21.984 --> 1:22:23.735
Yeah! That's my Ramona.

1:22:23.819 --> 1:22:27.197
I can't believe my eyes!
Two living mummies!

1:22:27.281 --> 1:22:30.075
You say "mummy,"
but he's nothing but a sack of bones.

1:22:30.158 --> 1:22:32.452
And rancid bandages, I know, I know.

1:22:33.495 --> 1:22:37.833
But the most distinguished sack of bones
I have ever laid eyes on.

1:22:39.042 --> 1:22:42.754
The Inca and Egyptian culture
together after thousands of years.

1:22:42.838 --> 1:22:44.381
You should be proud of yourselves.

1:22:44.464 --> 1:22:47.467
But the big lesson about this adventure
isn't who we are,

1:22:47.551 --> 1:22:48.844
but who we've shared it with.

1:22:48.927 --> 1:22:52.139
And I've shared it
with my very best friend in the world!

1:22:52.222 --> 1:22:55.100
My buddy, my colleague,
my bro, my pal, my...

1:22:55.184 --> 1:22:57.561
Okay, okay, thanks, Mummy.
We get the idea.

1:22:57.644 --> 1:23:01.398
I don't know what I'd do without you,
Chicken! Right, buddy?

1:23:05.569 --> 1:23:07.196
Chicken!
