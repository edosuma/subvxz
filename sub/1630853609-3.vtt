WEBVTT

00:30.989 --> 00:32.323
-Hello, beautiful.
-Fuck!

00:32.406 --> 00:35.077
Jesus Christ, you scared me.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.370
How are you so quiet?

00:36.453 --> 00:39.498
I'm extremely strong,
but I weigh almost nothing.

00:40.332 --> 00:41.583
-Good for you.
-I know.

00:41.667 --> 00:44.878
So, we have
a very full "Molly" day scheduled.

00:44.962 --> 00:48.507
I have all of your favorite activities
through 8:00 p.m.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.843
at which point
I will drop you back off at your bed

00:50.926 --> 00:54.012
where you can get your traditional 11 and
a half hours of beauty rest. You ready?

00:54.096 --> 00:56.181
Thank you for being here for me today.

00:56.265 --> 00:57.266
I am ready.

01:00.477 --> 01:01.770
Am I doing it right?

01:01.854 --> 01:05.107
-Yeah, babe. You're crushing it.
-Really?

01:05.190 --> 01:07.150
You should be the teacher, not me.

01:08.402 --> 01:11.905
God, Ryan Gosling renovating a house.
Why can't this be every movie?

01:11.989 --> 01:15.868
Yeah. Gosling's whatever,
but I'm here for Sam Shepard.

01:15.951 --> 01:19.705
I love a man that looks like
he came straight out of a fucking bog.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.672
All you, Marisol. Oh, yeah!

01:29.882 --> 01:31.091
Yours.

01:32.176 --> 01:33.468
Goddamn it, Marisol!

01:33.552 --> 01:36.388
I thought the knee surgery
was going to increase your mobility.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.351
Where'd you get it done? In urgent care?

01:45.564 --> 01:46.815
Hey, you ready?

01:46.899 --> 01:49.693
You got three bitches in here
ready for a sunset walk.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.820
I'll be right there. Just need to pee.

01:55.157 --> 01:56.408
Okay.

01:56.491 --> 02:00.579
-You have been through a lot this year.
-I have.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.706
Yeah, it's been hard on everyone.

02:02.789 --> 02:07.085
You know, I don't care what anyone says.
Divorce is really difficult.

02:07.169 --> 02:09.963
But I wouldn't change a thing
about what's happened.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.256
No regrets.

02:11.757 --> 02:15.511
It seems you've grown a lot
just in the conversation we've had so far.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.137
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

02:17.221 --> 02:19.264
And I wanna thank you
for your vulnerability.

02:19.348 --> 02:20.891
I think that's really brave of you.

02:20.974 --> 02:24.645
-Are you fucking joking?
-Yeah. Me too.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.188
-We're just soul mates.
-Yeah.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.440
Every day, he teaches me something new.

02:28.524 --> 02:31.360
And I'm teaching him too. Windsurfing.

02:31.443 --> 02:33.153
She has incredible balance.

02:33.237 --> 02:34.613
I almost never fall.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.240
So tell me,

02:36.323 --> 02:40.702
what do you think about the journey
Molly's on now, with her foundation?

02:40.786 --> 02:42.913
It's got a sizable endowment,
thanks to you.

02:42.996 --> 02:47.125
Yeah, Molly.
Well, she has a really big heart.

02:47.209 --> 02:48.836
It's gonna be a challenge.

02:48.919 --> 02:52.214
I mean, she's never done anything
like this before, and I have to say,

02:52.297 --> 02:55.592
it's a bit more complicated
than organizing a cocktail party,

02:55.676 --> 02:56.844
which she's great at.

02:58.387 --> 03:02.307
I'm just not sure that she knows
entirely what she's getting herself into,

03:03.725 --> 03:07.437
-but I wish her the best.
-Wish me the best? Fuck you, dude.

03:08.272 --> 03:09.356
What are you doing?

03:10.357 --> 03:11.567
I'm just--

03:11.650 --> 03:12.985
I'm using the bathroom.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.654
I know what you're watching,
and you need to stop it.

03:15.737 --> 03:16.864
Put down the phone.

03:16.947 --> 03:20.617
No. I'm not watching anything.

03:21.118 --> 03:22.619
Molly, open the door.

03:23.370 --> 03:26.123
Hi. I'm fine. Everything's fine.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.917
I am just being thorough.
I'm trying to get everything out.

03:29.001 --> 03:32.045
-Okay.
-And then after I'm done in here,

03:32.129 --> 03:35.632
I'm gonna find out where John is,
I'm gonna go to that location,

03:35.716 --> 03:37.843
-and I am gonna murder him in his sleep.
-I knew it.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.344
I knew it. Give me the phone.

03:39.428 --> 03:40.679
-No. Never!
-Come--

04:26.892 --> 04:29.686
Okay, everyone,
let's address the elephant in the room.

04:29.770 --> 04:33.982
I did see John's interview last night,
and at first, I was furious,

04:34.066 --> 04:38.403
but then when I woke up this morning,
I was even more furious.

04:38.487 --> 04:41.156
However, now,
talking about it to all of you,

04:41.240 --> 04:45.911
I'm reaching some third level of anger
that I didn't even know existed.

04:46.578 --> 04:49.623
You know what? You should be angry.
That shit was ridiculous.

04:49.706 --> 04:50.707
Thank you.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.001
Okay, we were trying
to bring the levels down.

04:53.085 --> 04:56.922
Why? They gave John
and his mistress 45 full minutes.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.050
The baby who got stuck
on the telephone pole only got seven.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.803
Yeah, I normally
don't use language like this,

05:02.886 --> 05:06.640
but his shirt was as ugly
as his business policies.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.810
Damn, Arthur.
You write that joke just for this meeting?

05:09.893 --> 05:12.813
When I thought of it,
I felt like I was a regular Ray Romano.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.147
I don't know who that is.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.692
Thank you, guys, for supporting me.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.278
You'll be happy to know
that I'm hitting back at him.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.071
-Good.
-Yeah, what do you mean?

05:21.154 --> 05:24.283
Well, people have always asked me
to do interviews, and I usually say noâ€¦

05:24.950 --> 05:26.243
until last night.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.495
I had quite a bit of wine,

05:28.579 --> 05:31.915
-and I said yes to, like, ten of them.
-Three bottles.

05:33.041 --> 05:37.045
-Which ones?
-There's a range of them.

05:37.129 --> 05:39.381
I mean,
he said I don't know what I'm doing,

05:39.464 --> 05:42.134
so I need to prove I have substance.

05:42.217 --> 05:47.264
60 Minutes? Anderson Cooper? NPR?
Molly, this shit is really advanced.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.516
They are going to ask you
really tough questions.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.476
Good. I can handle it.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.729
I'm not gonna take this sitting down.

05:55.647 --> 05:59.026
-He doesn't get to say that about me.
-Okay. I hear you.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.153
When's the first one?

06:01.820 --> 06:04.114
-Tomorrow.
-Oh, my God.

06:04.198 --> 06:05.324
We need to prep you.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.784
You need to learn about
every single thing we deal with here.

06:07.868 --> 06:11.121
Wonderful. Great. I do have
a microneedling appointment at 3:30,

06:11.205 --> 06:14.750
and judging from the look on your face,
we're gonna need to cancel that.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.127
-Okay, but can I still go?
-No one goes anywhere.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.754
This is our mission today.

06:19.505 --> 06:21.089
We are going to get his ass.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.763
Baby, you didn't have to come all the way
down here to bring me my lunch.

06:27.846 --> 06:30.390
-I wanted to see you.
-Let me see.

06:33.936 --> 06:36.313
-It looks yummy.
-You look yummy.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.984
Now I'm full from kisses.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.403
You crazy. Bye.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.950
You have got to help me.
Me and Tanya are on the rocks.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.702
What? When she got here,
you guys made out for, like, 25 minutes

06:50.786 --> 06:52.663
in the middle of the office,
which was a choice.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.373
Yeah, but there was
so much hidden tension.

06:54.456 --> 06:58.377
She didn't call me "Boo-Boo" the whole
time she was here, and that is a bad sign.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.921
I'm worried it's got something
to do with our eight-year anniversary.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.589
Oh, my God. Eight years.

07:02.673 --> 07:05.592
Yeah, and each year, I've been able
to romantically outdo myself.

07:05.676 --> 07:07.219
Like last year, I got her an anklet,

07:07.302 --> 07:10.514
and we went to Chili's.
The good one. Not the one in the mall.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.474
So this year needs to be perfect.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.643
And Tanya is a very visual person.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.688
And you're very stylish, so I need you
to tell me what I should wear.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.565
Look. What do you think?

07:23.068 --> 07:26.697
Okay. There are cartoon characters
on all of these T-shirts.

07:26.780 --> 07:31.451
What? Goku is not a cartoon character.
He is an anime martial artist.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.328
Okay, fine. Whatever. Listen.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.331
Not that I care,
because I definitely don't,

07:36.415 --> 07:38.417
but don't wear any of those T-shirts,
okay?

07:38.500 --> 07:40.627
Buy something new, something adult.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.963
It'll show her
that you think the dinner is special.

07:43.046 --> 07:46.175
And by doing that, you'll show her
that you think she's special.

07:46.258 --> 07:50.012
You're so good at this. I mean,
are all your relationships, like, perfect?

07:51.597 --> 07:55.017
Yes. And none of them have lasted
over 72 hours.

07:57.895 --> 08:01.607
So we made these binders that explain
every organization that we partner with.

08:01.690 --> 08:04.109
And I made you some
color-coded flash cards, if that helps.

08:04.193 --> 08:07.321
Okay. That's not so bad.
I can get through this.

08:07.905 --> 08:09.740
Well, Rhonda's bringing in the rest.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.658
It's okay, I got it.

08:15.078 --> 08:17.664
Is there a movie version
of this stuff I can watch?

08:17.748 --> 08:20.417
Nope. You should get going.
Clock's ticking.

08:21.251 --> 08:24.755
Okay. So, let me give you a massage
before you start.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.382
Rhonda. We had a meeting about this.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.009
Wha--

08:29.092 --> 08:32.386
I just don't see how we get to know
each other without the power of touch.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.599
Is it me? It's me. I--

08:37.267 --> 08:38.519
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

08:45.359 --> 08:46.360
Yikes.

08:54.785 --> 08:55.786
Come in.

08:56.370 --> 08:57.913
-Hey there.
-Hi.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.873
Looks like
you're making some good progress.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.960
Thanks. I'm getting there.

09:03.043 --> 09:06.213
Hey, I saw that you've been
holding those binders

09:06.296 --> 09:08.340
pretty far away from your face
to read them.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.592
Really?

09:10.717 --> 09:13.428
Do you mind trying something for a second?

09:14.346 --> 09:17.099
You know what, I don't need those.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.059
Just give them a try for a second.

09:20.269 --> 09:21.520
Just for a sec.

09:25.691 --> 09:28.360
Holy fucking shitballs.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.654
-I can see everything.
-I--

09:30.737 --> 09:32.072
It's like I'm a superhero.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.283
Look, there's the pen I couldn't find.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.493
I know. It's like magic, you know.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.954
Oh, my gosh. Do you have blond eyebrows?

09:39.538 --> 09:40.372
Yes.

09:40.455 --> 09:42.833
I don't think I've ever seen that
on an adult man.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.376
Well, it's not natural.

09:44.459 --> 09:46.336
I do have to bleach them. Yep.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.256
Well, it's really working for you.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.841
-Well, thank you very much.
-Okay.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.718
And keep the glasses, okay?

09:52.801 --> 09:54.720
I've got four more pairs in my desk.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.139
I don't mean to brag,
but I have a Costco membership.

09:57.222 --> 10:01.768
Oh, my God. Costco? Excuse me.

10:01.852 --> 10:02.978
Can you get me in?

10:03.061 --> 10:04.771
I don't know.

10:04.855 --> 10:07.191
You have to have $75 and a photo ID.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.693
-Then I'm out.
-Yeah. I figured.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.488
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.283
I love you.

10:16.366 --> 10:19.494
-I love you.
-I love you.

10:19.578 --> 10:20.579
I love you.

10:20.662 --> 10:25.083
Well, then that's such a good thing,
because I love you.

10:25.167 --> 10:26.960
-I love you.
-Bye.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.796
-She is pissed.
-What are you talking about?

10:29.880 --> 10:31.965
You were just saying
how much you loved each other.

10:32.049 --> 10:34.176
Okay, well,
I guess when you go to the movies

10:34.259 --> 10:36.970
you only pay attention
to the exact words being said on-screen.

10:37.054 --> 10:40.224
There's deeper meaning between the lines.
It is called subtext.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.226
Okay, fine. Whatever.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.603
Can I get back
to catfishing my ex's dad now?

10:44.686 --> 10:47.731
No. Although that does sound interesting.

10:47.814 --> 10:48.982
It is.

10:49.066 --> 10:51.860
-I think I'm falling in love with him.
-Okay, well, anyway, look.

10:51.944 --> 10:54.947
I made a reservation at Cheesecake Factory
for our anniversary,

10:55.030 --> 10:58.784
and then all of a sudden, Tanya's
telling me that's not romantic enough.

10:59.451 --> 11:00.869
I mean, what is she talking about?

11:00.953 --> 11:04.331
All the waiters wear ties,
there's candles on every table,

11:04.414 --> 11:06.708
and it's so loud in there
no one can hear you fart.

11:06.792 --> 11:09.419
Yeah, I think I'm gonna side with Tanya
on this one.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.547
Okay. Where would you wanna go?

11:11.630 --> 11:13.841
You should definitely
take her someplace new. Okay?

11:13.924 --> 11:16.176
Having new experiences
with a partner brings you closer.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.804
It's a big part of growing
and evolving together.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.556
That's amazing.

11:20.639 --> 11:23.267
You are really good at this.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.478
And thank you again. I'm gonna do that.

11:26.562 --> 11:29.731
And good luck to you and Mr. Fitzgerald.

11:32.776 --> 11:34.736
Says I can call him Dan now.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.491
Okay, I'm heading home, guys.

11:39.575 --> 11:42.744
What's the average rent
of a two-bedroom apartment in LA county?

11:43.745 --> 11:47.457
$2,545. Double the national average.

11:49.918 --> 11:51.545
-Correct.
-Yes!

11:53.338 --> 11:54.590
Thanks, everybody.

11:54.673 --> 11:55.883
I've learned a lot today.

11:55.966 --> 11:58.719
The world is in a much, much worse place
than I thought it was,

11:58.802 --> 12:02.347
and that's a real bummer,
but I'm still pumped for these interviews.

12:06.602 --> 12:11.356
Guys, just don't make
a big deal out of it. It's just a CW show.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.651
Are you kidding me? You play a vampire
who protects humans from other vampires.

12:14.735 --> 12:17.154
That's amazing.
It's so psychologically complex.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.156
Yeah. I mean, of course you got it.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.992
You're Paul. You get everything you want.

12:22.618 --> 12:24.203
Congratulations.

12:24.286 --> 12:25.329
Cheers.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.413
Thanks, boys.

12:33.295 --> 12:35.464
Sorry, I think I have to take this.

12:41.470 --> 12:42.721
Hello, who is this?

12:42.804 --> 12:45.307
Thank God. This is a walking emergency.

12:45.390 --> 12:48.060
Howard? What the hell?
Is this a work thing?

12:48.143 --> 12:51.021
Oh, no, it's not a work thing.
I'm just in a crisis right now.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.149
I mean, Tanya and I
are at that restaurant that you suggested,

12:54.233 --> 12:56.985
and our server is Danielle.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.657
Why aren't you reacting in horror
right now?

13:01.740 --> 13:03.200
Because I don't know who that is.

13:04.034 --> 13:05.786
Danielle is Tanya's cousin,

13:05.869 --> 13:08.497
who I went on a date with
when Tanya and I were on a break.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.290
But Tanya doesn't know that.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.543
I mean,
I'm stuck in some Dangerous Liaisons shit.

13:13.126 --> 13:16.964
Okay. Howard, listen to me.
I can't help you.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.465
We are not at work, okay?

13:18.549 --> 13:22.344
I am out right now with
my hot white gay friends who I kinda hate.

13:22.427 --> 13:25.556
This is completely inappropriate.
My off time is sacred.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.808
You need to lose my number.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.060
All right, man.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.021
Look, I get it. We're just work friends.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.566
I'll go ahead and delete your number, man.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.192
Okay, How--

13:50.289 --> 13:52.332
-Molly, you have a guest here.
-I do?

13:55.836 --> 13:58.213
Sofia, hey. What are you doing here?

13:58.297 --> 14:00.924
Is she getting paid overtime
for being here after 5:00?

14:02.634 --> 14:05.179
I hope it's okay that I came by.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.222
When I was driving home, I realized

14:07.306 --> 14:10.809
that we probably didn't go over the
California Clean Air Initiative enough.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.478
Okay, we can run it again.

14:13.562 --> 14:16.565
Really, all of this climate change stuff
needs a brush up.

14:17.232 --> 14:21.236
All right. Well,
I was going to have a massage and a bath.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.156
But I guess it can wait.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.325
Do you want something to eat?

14:27.367 --> 14:29.286
Sure. What do you have?

14:30.329 --> 14:31.496
Anything.

14:32.581 --> 14:36.001
I'm not joking. You can literally
ask for anything, and they'll make it.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.085
Really?

14:37.753 --> 14:41.507
Well, how about
a chicken potpie and a cherry Slurpee?

14:49.181 --> 14:51.892
I'm supposed to shoot
this indie thing in Alabama.

14:51.975 --> 14:55.395
The script is pretty good,
but it's 110 degrees there right now,

14:55.479 --> 14:57.606
and they don't sell alcohol on Sundays.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.191
What a nightmare.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.735
Yes, I know.
That's why I'm saying it, Paul.

15:01.818 --> 15:05.239
I am so sorry.
I think I have to go make a phone call.

15:05.322 --> 15:06.323
Be right back.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.491
Right.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.618
-Should we eat his dessert?
-Definitely.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.745
Yeah? All right. Oh, my gosh. Yum.

15:21.547 --> 15:23.465
Yo, if this is the guy I sold my PS5 to,

15:23.549 --> 15:25.467
the controllers were like that
when I bought it.

15:25.551 --> 15:26.385
It's Nicholas.

15:26.468 --> 15:30.472
See, I told you I'd delete your number,
and I did. I'm a man of my word.

15:30.556 --> 15:31.974
So, listen, Howard.

15:32.057 --> 15:35.352
I think you should tell Tanya
the truth about Danielle.

15:36.061 --> 15:39.606
Yeah, it's gonna be hard,
and she's probably not going to like it,

15:39.690 --> 15:41.775
but you should
just rip the Band-Aid off now.

15:41.859 --> 15:43.485
Okay? It's best to be honest.

15:43.569 --> 15:47.948
You know, and she'll understand.
And if she doesn't, then that's on her.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.908
That's really good advice.

15:49.992 --> 15:50.993
My other friend, Paris,

15:51.076 --> 15:54.037
he told me I should
just try to get with both of them tonight.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.205
And I knew that was wrong.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.417
So, thanks a lot, Nicholas.
I appreciate you.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.002
Don't mention it.

16:00.627 --> 16:05.299
So, do you have anything
I could help you with right now?

16:07.801 --> 16:08.802
No.

16:09.303 --> 16:10.304
Okay.

16:17.728 --> 16:19.521
This is the best Slurpee I've ever had.

16:19.605 --> 16:22.941
David Chang makes them
with real cherries from Washington State.

16:23.734 --> 16:24.735
Okay.

16:25.485 --> 16:32.201
Black carbon, methane,
reduces warming by 2050 from 0.4 to

16:32.284 --> 16:34.369
I don't remember.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.955
I don't remember any of this.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.874
It's okay. Let's go over it again.

16:38.957 --> 16:42.586
Can we just-- Can we take a break?
I need to stretch my legs.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.298
Would you like a tour?

16:46.798 --> 16:49.843
Yes, I definitely do. This place is crazy.

16:51.178 --> 16:54.014
If I just say the word "beignets,"
will some show up?

17:40.310 --> 17:41.395
What's in here?

17:42.062 --> 17:44.398
This is John's old office.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.650
I don't come in here very often.

17:47.860 --> 17:51.154
I was always jealous of kids who grew up
with a lot of books in their house.

17:52.739 --> 17:56.034
That section
is mostly books he wrote himself.

17:56.118 --> 17:57.995
Damn, this is dense.

17:58.495 --> 17:59.621
It's all numbers.

17:59.705 --> 18:03.166
Well, he is credited with creating three
different computer programming languages.

18:03.250 --> 18:07.880
Yeah, he's an asshole,
but he's definitely not dumb.

18:09.882 --> 18:11.842
Maybe we should get back to studying.

18:12.718 --> 18:14.761
Yeah, we gotta hit those books hard.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.901
We were supposed to leave ten minutes ago.

18:28.984 --> 18:32.070
Okay, she said she was on her way,
but she's not picking up her cell.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.864
Maybe she got stuck in traffic.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.366
She owns multiple helicopters.

18:36.450 --> 18:37.951
I'm calling her again.

18:39.870 --> 18:41.872
-Hey.
-Where are you?

18:41.955 --> 18:47.169
I'm not going to do Anderson Cooper.
Or any of the other interviews.

18:47.252 --> 18:49.838
I canceled them. I'm sorry.

18:49.922 --> 18:51.173
What?

18:51.256 --> 18:53.008
-I was thinking last night.
-You canceled?

18:53.091 --> 18:57.387
I'm not going to do well
at some dry fancy-pants interview.

18:57.471 --> 19:00.516
I-- That's John's thing.
I can't compete with him on that.

19:00.599 --> 19:04.186
Well, just come in to the office,
and we can talk about this.

19:04.269 --> 19:05.604
Well, I can't.

19:05.687 --> 19:08.607
I'm actually about to do another show
right now.

19:08.690 --> 19:10.609
And I think
it's a little bit more my style,

19:10.692 --> 19:12.986
and I really feel like
it's gonna get people on my side.

19:14.571 --> 19:15.781
What's the other show?

19:15.864 --> 19:19.076
Welcome to Hot Ones, the show
with hot questions and even hotter wings.

19:19.159 --> 19:22.246
And today we're joined
by billionaire philanthropist Molly Wells,

19:22.329 --> 19:24.665
who's here to talk about
some of her incredible charity work.

19:24.748 --> 19:26.124
Molly, welcome to the show.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.751
Thank you so much for having me.

19:27.835 --> 19:33.257
I am so excited to talk about
the foundation, and to eat some "wangs."

19:38.762 --> 19:42.558
Okay, great. Well, we'll start
with the Howler Monkey original hot sauce.

19:42.641 --> 19:44.768
Okay. This is so exciting.

19:48.564 --> 19:49.648
Tasty.

19:50.148 --> 19:51.400
This is good.

19:51.483 --> 19:53.068
So, the Wells Foundation.

19:53.151 --> 19:56.947
Tell me about some of the things that your
organization is focused on specifically.

19:57.030 --> 20:00.158
Of course. One of the things
that we're very passionate about is--

20:04.663 --> 20:08.792
Wow. That one's got a little heat to it,
doesn't it?

20:08.876 --> 20:10.752
My goodness. I'm just gonna have a little.

20:10.836 --> 20:11.920
Yeah, are you okay?

20:12.504 --> 20:13.630
I'm good.

20:13.714 --> 20:15.299
I'm good. Excuse me.

20:16.508 --> 20:18.760
The cost of living in Los Angeles is--

20:18.844 --> 20:20.012
Fucker.

20:20.095 --> 20:21.972
I'm so sorry. It's so hot.

20:22.598 --> 20:23.599
That's the first one?

20:23.682 --> 20:27.853
Yeah, the Howler Monkey
only has a Scoville rating of about 600.

20:27.936 --> 20:30.147
We actually have nine more wings to go.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.356
Nine?

20:32.566 --> 20:35.110
Let's move on. Hopefully you'll
like this one a little bit more.

20:35.194 --> 20:36.653
I'm sure I will.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.698
Okay. That one hit right away.

20:39.781 --> 20:42.534
-That one has a little bit of a kick.
-You think so?

20:42.618 --> 20:45.662
So, what inspired you
to become more involved with charity?

20:45.746 --> 20:48.457
-Sean, I'ma need you to do me a favor.
-Anything.

20:48.540 --> 20:50.834
-I'm gonna need you to shut the fuck up.
-Got it.

20:52.252 --> 20:55.923
All right,
so this next sauce, the Dragon's Breathâ€¦

20:56.006 --> 20:57.007
I'm out of beer.

20:58.050 --> 21:00.344
Girl with the beer, come here.

21:00.427 --> 21:05.057
â€¦has a Scoville rating
of more than 155,000.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.227
Thank you. I love you. Okay.

21:09.686 --> 21:11.104
Keep talking. It's cool.

21:11.188 --> 21:13.273
I'm just gonna pour the milk
right into it.

21:14.650 --> 21:15.692
All right,

21:15.776 --> 21:17.945
so we're getting into serious territory.

21:18.028 --> 21:19.321
Oh, God!

21:23.784 --> 21:26.495
So it seems like your ex-husband
has been supportive of your efforts--

21:26.578 --> 21:28.455
Hey, fuck that motherfucker.

21:28.539 --> 21:31.333
-So, things are not great?
-Good one, Sean.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.293
What did you go to? Fucking school?

21:33.377 --> 21:37.506
If that asshole hadn't cheated on me,
I wouldn't be on your stupid-ass show

21:37.589 --> 21:44.304
getting my fucking face melted off eating
these little tiny spicy pieces of shit

21:44.388 --> 21:49.351
while blowing my fucking shorts out
on fucking national television!

21:49.434 --> 21:54.147
-It's a YouTube show. But I get you.
-I don't give a fuck what the fuck it is!

21:56.024 --> 21:59.945
Are you ready to move on
to the next sauce, Caribbean Scorch?

22:00.028 --> 22:01.238
Shoes coming off.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.240
Let me tell you something, Sean.

22:04.658 --> 22:06.827
I have $87 billion.

22:06.910 --> 22:12.583
I could buy you and this whole studio
and every motherfucker in it.

22:12.666 --> 22:17.004
And I could shut it the fuck down.

22:18.046 --> 22:21.592
I could kill everybody in here
and get away with it.

22:22.301 --> 22:25.512
All right.
I think maybe we should wrap this up.

22:25.596 --> 22:29.099
I don't need anything.
I don't need anybody.

22:29.183 --> 22:31.226
I have 11 houses, motherfucker.

22:44.990 --> 22:46.575
Hey, dude. You busy?

22:46.658 --> 22:48.243
Yes. Very.

22:48.327 --> 22:50.037
Well, I'm sorry, but this cannot wait.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.539
You were totally right the other night.

22:52.623 --> 22:55.751
I mean, Tanya and I, we had a hard convo.

22:55.834 --> 22:58.045
But she totally respected my honesty.

22:58.128 --> 23:01.548
And then later that night in her bedroom,
we were intimate.

23:02.132 --> 23:05.677
Anyway, I got you
a little token of my appreciation.

23:06.845 --> 23:07.846
Who is she?

23:07.930 --> 23:10.766
Vegeta from Dragon Ball Z.
Prince of the Saiyans?

23:10.849 --> 23:12.643
Come on.
Don't tell me you don't know Vegeta.

23:12.726 --> 23:14.686
I don't know what any of those words mean.

23:14.770 --> 23:18.857
Okay, well, you're Vegeta and I'm Goku.

23:18.941 --> 23:23.779
Friendly rivals turned great friends,
but still very wary of each other.

23:23.862 --> 23:27.449
That's the strongest kind of friendship,
a weird one.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.911
"Kamehameha!"

23:30.994 --> 23:32.829
That's his catchphrase.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.843
Molly, the very intense lady is back.

23:46.343 --> 23:47.553
Thank you, Marisol.

23:47.636 --> 23:49.847
I take that as a compliment, by the way.

23:53.267 --> 23:55.185
Look, I know I screwed up,

23:55.269 --> 23:59.231
so whatever it is that you're here
to say to me, just go ahead and say it.

23:59.314 --> 24:01.108
I didn't come over here to give a speech.

24:01.608 --> 24:04.945
I actually came over here to apologize.

24:06.780 --> 24:08.365
-What?
-Look, don't get me wrong.

24:08.448 --> 24:09.783
You embarrassed yourself.

24:10.409 --> 24:13.787
You gotta stop saying you
could kill everyone and get away with it.

24:13.871 --> 24:15.622
Let's make that a rule moving forward.

24:15.706 --> 24:17.958
Okay, you're right.

24:18.041 --> 24:20.419
But yesterday wasn't all your fault.

24:21.461 --> 24:24.131
You were ready for those interviews,
but I didn't trust you.

24:24.214 --> 24:27.593
I came over here,
and I pushed you way too hard.

24:28.093 --> 24:29.094
I made it worse.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.848
Look, I appreciate that. I really do.

24:34.933 --> 24:37.853
I just think if anyone screwed me up,
it wasn't you.

24:39.104 --> 24:40.189
It was John.

24:42.441 --> 24:44.318
He said I don't know what I'm doing.

24:44.401 --> 24:47.654
Andâ€¦ maybe I don't know what I'm doing.

24:47.738 --> 24:48.822
Let me ask you a question.

24:48.906 --> 24:51.950
Why do you care about
what that guy thinks about anything?

24:56.038 --> 25:00.542
Listen, I know he's a fucking asshole.
But you saw all those books he wrote.

25:00.626 --> 25:05.380
His whole empire, this thing
that he built, it's so intimidating.

25:05.464 --> 25:06.798
Uh-uh, whatever.

25:06.882 --> 25:11.303
These guys always act like they do
everything by themselves, but they don't.

25:11.386 --> 25:13.263
You should know that better than anyone.

25:13.347 --> 25:14.348
Yeah. I mean,

25:14.431 --> 25:17.893
I did pay our rent the first two years
he was getting the company off the ground.

25:17.976 --> 25:21.313
And I designed the original logo.
The new one looks likeâ€¦

25:21.396 --> 25:22.898
-A dick.
-Yeah.

25:22.981 --> 25:25.609
All I'm saying is he's no better than you.

25:26.818 --> 25:31.323
And if we're doing this together,
you need to get him out of your head.

25:35.577 --> 25:36.578
I'll try.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.582
-Thanks for coming by.
-Yeah, of course.

25:45.379 --> 25:47.464
Go ahead. I know you wanna do it.

25:48.507 --> 25:50.217
Shrimp lo mein and a Shirley Temple.

25:51.301 --> 25:53.387
It'll be here in seven minutes.

26:01.645 --> 26:02.855
Hi, Molly.

26:02.938 --> 26:04.273
Thanks for doing this.

26:04.356 --> 26:07.943
I thought we could start by talking about
the housing shortage here in LA.

26:13.198 --> 26:14.366
Okay.

26:14.867 --> 26:15.909
I'm ready.
