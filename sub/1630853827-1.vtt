Risotto.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.159
And now, how do you feel?

02:28.360 --> 02:30.319
Cold, I'm far away.

02:36.439 --> 02:37.439
What do you hear?

02:39.479 --> 02:43.240
It's confusing,
there are sounds that get in.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.080
-Memories?
-Yes.

02:47.759 --> 02:48.919
Take a deep breath.

02:53.080 --> 02:55.360
Is it possible to remember things
that haven't happened?

02:55.759 --> 02:56.680
Does it hurt?

03:04.719 --> 03:06.280
They've hurt me a lot, yes.

03:09.879 --> 03:10.879
What do you see now?

03:12.360 --> 03:13.360
Monochrome.

03:14.360 --> 03:19.120
CHARLOTTE

03:24.080 --> 03:25.280
What's the matter?

03:28.039 --> 03:29.919
It's been days
since I slept

03:31.719 --> 03:32.719
and...

03:33.599 --> 03:37.680
sounds and memories
come to me,

03:39.240 --> 03:41.360
before I was able to shake them away
at any time,

03:41.680 --> 03:45.879
but now they come
without me inviting them

03:47.800 --> 03:49.560
and I'm sleepy, to be honest.

04:02.520 --> 04:03.879
Is this another test?

04:37.839 --> 04:42.959
SLEEPING PILLS

04:52.319 --> 04:54.160
Do you need an appointment
for next week?

04:54.240 --> 04:55.240
No, no...

05:01.800 --> 05:02.720
Thank you.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.319
I would check on the doctor,
I think he's dead.

Lean out!

06:31.600 --> 06:32.519
Shit!

06:37.240 --> 06:38.600
What do you think Lee, you like it?

06:42.720 --> 06:44.240
It's beautiful.

07:43.519 --> 07:45.160
One hundred and fifty two.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.000
One hundred and fifty two what?

07:48.800 --> 07:49.800
Nothing.

07:52.000 --> 07:52.959
Do you want to take it?

07:53.680 --> 07:57.120
No, it's time to renovate it.

It's gone, eh.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
What's gone?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
That's horrible!

10:01.200 --> 10:02.240
What's gone?

10:03.159 --> 10:05.840
It's gone, I don't' need them.

10:06.759 --> 10:08.039
Do you have shoes on?

10:08.120 --> 10:11.799
That's horrible, I'm fine,
I don't need glasses anymore.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.120
Charlotte,
presbyopia doesn't have a cure.

10:15.840 --> 10:18.240
It does, man!
It does, or at least it does for me,

10:18.320 --> 10:20.080
I've been cured,
my near vision is good.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.799
Huh, okay, read one for me.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.240
"Gas... par Thibert..."

10:27.799 --> 10:30.559
"The acclaimed director Gaspar Thibert
travels to Paraguay

10:30.639 --> 10:32.639
to shoot his last film, 'Miniature.'"

10:35.960 --> 10:38.000
-Did you cut yourself?
-No, I'm fine!

10:38.080 --> 10:41.039
When was this?
This news, when was this?

10:41.519 --> 10:44.039
That's from today, what's wrong?

10:44.519 --> 10:45.639
Lee.

10:48.799 --> 10:49.720
Charlotte?

11:06.039 --> 11:06.960
Charlotte.

11:08.519 --> 11:09.960
Yes, the investors are here.

11:10.759 --> 11:13.399
-What are you saying?
-That he was waiting for them.

11:14.159 --> 11:15.120
Who?

11:15.759 --> 11:19.000
Gaspar Thibert,
he wrote to me, right?

11:19.399 --> 11:21.120
Oh, the director.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.720
Did he or did he not?

11:25.360 --> 11:29.320
Charlotte, it's been more than ten years
since we got any correspondence.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.240
Why did you choose these news, Lee?

11:33.519 --> 11:37.000
Because it's a last film

11:37.320 --> 11:39.440
and because
it's the endings turn today.

11:39.519 --> 11:42.679
He must think I'm completely dead,
of course.

11:42.759 --> 11:43.919
Oh, what things you say.

11:44.759 --> 11:49.919
Look Lee,
we dreamed this together,

11:50.399 --> 11:54.519
we worked on it together,
the main character is written for me,

11:54.600 --> 11:57.480
it's based on me,
the complexity of her emotions,

11:57.559 --> 12:01.080
her internal search
through the unknown.

12:01.159 --> 12:04.799
Oh yeah?
The internal or the unknown?

12:04.879 --> 12:07.399
Lee, sometimes I feel
I've educated you linearly.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.039
You didn't educate me,
so let's not get back to that.

12:11.759 --> 12:15.759
Miniature is an interior being

12:16.440 --> 12:19.360
with whom she lives constantly.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.240
Do you get it?

12:22.320 --> 12:25.639
Why didn't you ever mention
Miniature to me?

12:29.879 --> 12:31.000
1974.

12:31.080 --> 12:34.080
Lee, let me alone, go, please.

12:42.679 --> 12:45.960
"The young and beautiful Laila
gets out of bed carefully.

12:46.519 --> 12:49.200
It's been three months
since war devastated her life."

12:50.000 --> 12:51.440
"What are you afraid of?"

12:52.320 --> 12:54.759
"Myself and you, Miniature."

12:55.799 --> 12:58.120
"Laila... Get up."

13:33.679 --> 13:39.240
I can't sleep, I can't and I won't.

13:39.639 --> 13:40.840
Don't be dramatic.

13:42.919 --> 13:44.159
I have to go to Paraguay.

13:45.679 --> 13:47.559
How will we go to Paraguay?

13:47.919 --> 13:49.759
We won't go to Paraguay.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.480
He knows, Lee,
he knows this is for me,

13:54.559 --> 13:55.799
he owes me, that's how it is.

13:56.399 --> 13:59.159
I'll star in this movie, Lee.

13:59.759 --> 14:01.559
I didn't know
you wanted to go back to cinema.

14:01.639 --> 14:04.279
I'll rent the house and with
that money we'll go to Paraguay.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.480
-Do you want me to read it to you?
-Why don't you lay down?

14:09.559 --> 14:11.720
Because I won't be able to sleep
if I don't go, Lee!

14:13.240 --> 14:16.080
There are sleeping pills,
a psychiatrist can prescribe them.

14:16.159 --> 14:19.279
No, I don't want pills, you know I don't
take pills, I don't like them...

14:19.360 --> 14:21.519
-Paraguay.
-Psychiatrist.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.039
No, Paraguay, Paraguay.

14:23.480 --> 14:27.000
-No, psychiatrist.
-Oh, Lee! Paraguay.

14:29.240 --> 14:31.879
It's enough for therapy,
not for Paraguay,

14:31.960 --> 14:34.120
it isn't possible, we stay.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.519
AFTER

14:43.399 --> 14:46.559
What a good beginning, you and I

14:46.639 --> 14:51.320
How surprising and full of promises

14:51.879 --> 14:56.360
Your love trapped me so fast

14:56.799 --> 15:00.519
If we are right, we are wrong

15:00.600 --> 15:04.759
Everything's perfect
and something will fail

15:06.240 --> 15:10.039
And won't work, I know it

15:10.120 --> 15:16.519
But I do not care,
It is growing and I cannot stop it

15:17.000 --> 15:18.200
I knew it

15:18.279 --> 15:21.360
You became a part of my life

15:22.159 --> 15:25.279
Giving me all I wanted

15:25.639 --> 15:27.440
I knew it,

15:27.519 --> 15:30.720
that falling in love
wasn't a good idea.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.000
Here, yours.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.799
I don't think that's a good move, Lee.

15:44.799 --> 15:48.559
We didn't tell the tenants,
do you think it'll hold?

15:50.360 --> 15:52.000
That house is strong, like me.

16:47.559 --> 16:48.919
Lee to Charlotte?

16:50.200 --> 16:52.039
Yes, tell me, Lee.

16:52.840 --> 16:55.840
I can't take it anymore,
I need to sleep.

16:55.919 --> 16:57.080
That makes two of us.

16:58.679 --> 17:01.399
Charlotte, I need to stop.

17:01.759 --> 17:03.399
And I need to get there.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.200
Here, for the toll.

17:48.079 --> 17:50.759
-It's Immigration, Charlotte.
-What you mean, Immigration?

17:50.839 --> 17:53.279
My passport has been expired
for twenty years, Lee.

17:53.359 --> 17:55.880
WELCOME TO THE
REPUBLIC OF PARAGUAY

17:55.960 --> 17:58.319
ATTENTION, SECURITY CHECK
100 METERS

18:50.640 --> 18:51.559
Lee...

18:53.079 --> 18:55.680
Lee, why has this stopped?
Go check.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.000
We are stuck.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.160
Why did we stop?

19:10.920 --> 19:11.880
Pardon me?

19:20.400 --> 19:21.319
Hello.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.160
I need to know why we stopped.

19:27.599 --> 19:30.079
My dad already told you,
we need to wait.

19:31.160 --> 19:32.519
But that's not what we agreed,

19:33.160 --> 19:34.759
we need to get there
as soon as possible.

19:39.319 --> 19:40.480
Did you hurt your hand?

19:51.599 --> 19:54.359
I can't waste my time like this!
I just can't.

20:14.720 --> 20:17.880
Hi Samuel, it's IÃ±aki,
the producer of the movie,

20:17.960 --> 20:19.519
it's just to remind you

20:19.599 --> 20:22.839
that Gaspar and his photographer
are arriving today in the 3.30 flight,

20:23.599 --> 20:25.519
can you confirm
you'll be there to receive them?

20:30.039 --> 20:32.279
I feel like I am not part
of anything you do.

20:35.240 --> 20:38.039
Uh? Hugo, I beg you,
let's not do this now, okay?

20:38.119 --> 20:39.759
This is important to me.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.400
I kept thinking
about what you told me last night.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.680
Like I won't understand completely.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.839
I don't get it Hugo,
you live in my house.

20:51.319 --> 20:53.359
There you are! See?

20:54.799 --> 20:59.400
I live in your house,
it's never our house.

21:00.119 --> 21:01.720
That's because it isn't our house,
Hugo.

21:01.799 --> 21:05.640
it's my house, it's just a fact,
you get it?

21:06.359 --> 21:08.400
You like things better
when you keep them for yourself.

21:10.039 --> 21:12.599
-I don't want you to feel...
-No, no "I don't want you to feel", no!

21:12.680 --> 21:15.880
Let me feel what I feel, Hugo.
I beg you, okay?

21:23.319 --> 21:25.119
"Come with me, please.

21:26.440 --> 21:27.960
Don't be so stubborn,

21:28.039 --> 21:30.680
listen to what I have to say,
Miniature.

21:36.759 --> 21:39.440
Come with me, please.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.279
Come with me, please.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.640
There are places
where I'm not allowed.

21:51.640 --> 21:54.480
There are places
where I'm not allowed.

22:01.319 --> 22:02.799
Come with me, please.

22:05.319 --> 22:08.799
Do you see the river that flows
in front of us, beyond the cliff?

22:09.200 --> 22:10.279
Do you see it?

22:11.039 --> 22:14.559
Do you see the river that flows
in front of us, beyond the cliff?

22:16.839 --> 22:17.920
Yes.

22:18.680 --> 22:20.640
you'll have to go across it at sunset,

22:21.640 --> 22:24.279
otherwise, you won't be able
to continue.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.160
Let's go!

22:34.359 --> 22:38.799
I just want to understand you,
I'm Laila.

22:41.119 --> 22:42.119
Elena.

22:48.359 --> 22:51.079
Lee to Charlotte, I'm waiting for you.

22:51.839 --> 22:52.880
What for, Lee?

22:53.440 --> 22:54.599
The sunset.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.839
Charlotte to Lee.

24:01.599 --> 24:02.599
Charlotte to Lee.

24:06.599 --> 24:07.599
Yes.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.119
Tell me a story.

24:12.319 --> 24:13.839
I'm sleepy, Charlotte.

24:16.359 --> 24:17.960
One last effort, Lee.

24:23.759 --> 24:24.880
"Once upon a time,

24:25.880 --> 24:30.240
in a cold and humid
faraway village,

24:32.000 --> 24:35.680
there was a mountain
that was always covered in snow.

24:36.839 --> 24:39.359
It's like a transparent wall.

24:40.200 --> 24:43.960
Split this little grey village in two.

24:45.640 --> 24:47.359
Only those who live in that village,

24:47.440 --> 24:51.079
who understand that cold feeling...

24:53.079 --> 24:56.240
People in the East Village dare
not cross to the West Village.

24:57.400 --> 25:00.720
People in the West Village don't know
how to get to the East Village.

25:03.319 --> 25:06.359
Since that mountain appeared
in the middle,

25:07.960 --> 25:09.240
for years and years,

25:09.960 --> 25:13.000
people have been trying
to find the way

25:15.240 --> 25:17.559
to go over it to the other side,
with no success.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.160
And thus,

25:21.279 --> 25:23.359
many people have lived
their love stories

25:24.720 --> 25:26.160
with a mountain in between them,

25:27.440 --> 25:28.799
loving each other in the distance,

25:30.559 --> 25:32.039
looking at the same moon,

25:34.839 --> 25:37.319
without being able to embrace
and feel the other person's warmth.

25:41.200 --> 25:44.200
They haven't even been able
to find a crack

25:45.000 --> 25:48.480
through which spy the tears
in their lovers' eyes."

26:06.119 --> 26:07.440
Motherfucker!

26:19.960 --> 26:21.799
Nothing is fixed,

26:24.799 --> 26:26.400
everything is
about moving forward,

26:26.480 --> 26:28.440
moving forward and forward...

26:28.519 --> 26:30.519
HUGO CALLING

26:30.599 --> 26:31.799
comfortably in the desert

26:31.880 --> 26:33.920
as long as we are moving forward,
of course.

26:35.720 --> 26:39.920
But when thirst hits you,
there's emptiness.

26:42.240 --> 26:46.960
That, that is the sickness of our era,
nobody need anybody.

26:54.519 --> 26:57.519
Hey, do you think Gaspar came here

26:57.880 --> 27:00.680
looking to leave the boredom
of today's society behind?

27:04.319 --> 27:06.720
Samuel? Samuel?

27:09.160 --> 27:10.799
We're almost there.

27:12.200 --> 27:13.960
ENCOUNTERS

27:41.359 --> 27:43.200
We're not moving, Lee.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.359
We don't have gas Charlotte,

27:48.960 --> 27:52.400
I saw a village,
I'm going to get some.

27:55.039 --> 27:58.240
Lee, what was yesterday's
story about?

28:00.079 --> 28:03.440
Time... and love.

28:06.440 --> 28:07.720
I love it.

29:26.559 --> 29:27.559
I'm going with you guys.

29:38.799 --> 29:41.039
Come on! Wash yourself,
you're a mess, girl.

30:07.720 --> 30:09.079
Business trip?

30:10.400 --> 30:12.359
We're here to learn Spanish.

30:14.160 --> 30:15.759
Did you run out of gas, too?

30:16.160 --> 30:19.440
The driver is feeling sick;
we're waiting for his replacement.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.079
Road.

30:30.839 --> 30:31.759
Mirror.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.119
Drone.

30:38.240 --> 30:39.799
Is it for sale?

30:40.400 --> 30:42.480
I cannot confirm nor deny it.

30:47.799 --> 30:48.720
Eight hundred.

30:50.039 --> 30:51.000
Nine hundred.

30:51.960 --> 30:52.880
It' used.

31:25.920 --> 31:26.960
Lee.

31:27.359 --> 31:30.599
This is Elena, she's
coming with us.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.839
-And where is she going?
-Where are you going?

31:32.920 --> 31:33.920
Where are you guys going?

31:34.240 --> 31:36.279
-To the Lake Hotel.
-To the shooting.

31:36.680 --> 31:37.839
Is that near AsunciÃ³n?

31:37.920 --> 31:39.160
-No.
-Yes.

31:42.359 --> 31:43.839
"Laila, my dear..."

31:44.279 --> 31:46.640
-What will you do in AsunciÃ³n?
-"Time doesn't cure wounds."

31:46.720 --> 31:47.920
I'm going to live.

31:49.200 --> 31:51.319
"Wait, what are you saying,
Miniature..."

31:51.400 --> 31:53.119
And now you've hurt your other hand?

31:53.960 --> 31:55.119
"That pain..."

31:55.200 --> 31:56.519
I'm a boxer.

31:56.599 --> 31:57.880
"It must come from him."

32:02.000 --> 32:03.279
Is she your mom?

32:03.680 --> 32:05.000
We're friends.

32:07.319 --> 32:08.359
For a long time?

32:08.440 --> 32:13.680
Since always. Be quiet now, please,
I can't even read the script. God.

32:37.759 --> 32:39.759
LAKE HOTEL

32:52.519 --> 32:54.240
What? How am I?

32:58.200 --> 32:59.920
Majestic, as always.

33:03.519 --> 33:04.839
Give me the glasses, Elena.

33:10.839 --> 33:11.759
So?

33:16.640 --> 33:17.960
Ready?

33:18.039 --> 33:21.440
Yes, of course,
that's why we've come here.

33:27.359 --> 33:28.279
I'll go by myself.

33:43.720 --> 33:46.680
Good morning ma'am, welcome,
what can I do for you?

33:49.559 --> 33:50.759
Gaspar Thibert?

33:51.599 --> 33:53.440
Do you have a reservation
under that name, ma'am?

33:54.000 --> 33:55.519
No, he's staying here.

33:56.519 --> 33:59.079
Eh, one moment please.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.319
You don't need to pretend for me,
I know him well, don't worry.

34:08.559 --> 34:12.239
Yes, honestly,
we only have a lady registered.

34:14.280 --> 34:18.679
Please try to remember,
Gaspar Thibert, he was here.

34:21.079 --> 34:22.400
I saw him in the photograph.

34:23.880 --> 34:24.960
The photograph?

34:25.360 --> 34:26.800
From the movie.

34:28.199 --> 34:33.559
Oh, yes, yes, Gaspar, of course,
the interview they did here was nice,

34:34.400 --> 34:35.719
good thing I called.

34:35.800 --> 34:40.280
It seemed to be something important,
don't worry I didn't read anything.

34:41.599 --> 34:42.559
Thank you.

34:47.159 --> 34:48.239
We'll wait here,

34:49.159 --> 34:52.079
they are coming back soon
because I have Gaspar's notebook,

34:52.159 --> 34:53.400
it's very important to him.

34:54.519 --> 34:57.400
They'll be back
and they'll be back soon.

35:03.239 --> 35:06.079
Close the door Lee,
leave it, get out.

36:14.599 --> 36:17.800
Charlotte to Lee. Any news?

36:19.440 --> 36:21.360
None, over.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.480
We push the sky.

37:02.119 --> 37:03.920
Looking for
the sphere.

37:05.360 --> 37:06.559
Charlotte?

37:10.159 --> 37:14.039
Tell me a story, Lee,
I'm falling asleep.

37:14.119 --> 37:17.159
I don't know how to tell stories,
but I have my radio.

37:17.719 --> 37:23.320
I see, but I don't like the radio,
I rather you tell me something.

37:24.079 --> 37:25.000
Me?

37:25.559 --> 37:26.480
You.

37:30.199 --> 37:31.119
Okay.

37:33.599 --> 37:37.960
Two corners:
the red one, the blue one.

37:38.880 --> 37:41.400
The stadium is full.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.760
"Ahh," people are screaming,

37:44.840 --> 37:49.599
the sixth round is about to start
and they're both exhausted,

37:51.320 --> 37:53.679
specially the blue,

37:54.119 --> 37:58.719
his eyes are really small
from all the punches he's taken,

37:58.800 --> 38:00.440
the red one is doing better,

38:01.000 --> 38:05.079
you know, he's the favorite,
so he's more confident.

38:06.639 --> 38:09.280
and they start hitting each other.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.360
PRINT

38:31.440 --> 38:34.679
CATASTROPHES

38:36.239 --> 38:37.239
THE ANONYMOUS VICTIMS

38:37.320 --> 38:39.239
WHO JUMPED FROM
THE TWIN TOWERS ON 9-11

38:46.079 --> 38:47.159
Twin Towers?

38:48.119 --> 38:49.199
Horrible.

39:19.119 --> 39:20.719
Any news, Lee?

39:21.679 --> 39:23.039
No, nothing.

39:37.320 --> 39:41.079
I agree with you,
that hotel won't work,

39:41.159 --> 39:42.840
it's too classic for our movie.

39:43.440 --> 39:47.400
Damn it! what we need is a no-place,

39:47.480 --> 39:52.079
a no-time, but a no-time understood

39:52.159 --> 39:55.159
as an eternity
with no beginning and no end.

39:55.239 --> 40:00.199
As it's own cover
on an invisible hole,

40:00.280 --> 40:02.159
damn it, is it so hard?

40:15.039 --> 40:18.400
A divinity, invisible, eternal.

40:18.480 --> 40:20.719
Omnipresent, omnipotent,

40:21.239 --> 40:22.960
like the location you guys
are all looking for,

40:23.039 --> 40:25.719
but that won't happen.
I'll go out for some fresh air.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.760
Hey, do you think Gaspar
was inspired by their myths?

40:37.639 --> 40:40.519
-Present?
-It's today's theme.

40:41.679 --> 40:42.719
I also have some.

40:43.199 --> 40:45.320
-Some what?
-Some news.

40:45.760 --> 40:47.679
-About the present?
-Yes.

40:47.760 --> 40:51.360
Yes, about the movie,
they're trying actors in AsunciÃ³n.

40:51.440 --> 40:52.480
How do you know?

40:53.239 --> 40:54.679
Because I heard it on my radio.

40:55.239 --> 40:58.159
Lee, is it possible to go there
and come back the same day?

40:59.880 --> 41:03.559
Yes, I think it's
a great idea,

41:04.239 --> 41:06.599
it's also where
Elena wants to go.

41:17.760 --> 41:20.199
"Otherwise, you won't be able to go on,

41:20.280 --> 41:24.199
my name is Laila
and inside of me I have my Miniature,

41:24.280 --> 41:26.920
I just need to close my eyes
to hear her,

41:27.000 --> 41:29.800
and go through the tests she proposes.

41:29.880 --> 41:31.880
Knowledge test, value test,

41:31.960 --> 41:35.360
but I don't recognize myself,
I fight..."

41:36.760 --> 41:40.239
-"I want to know..."
-"I want to know how to learn.

41:42.440 --> 41:43.840
I want to know."

41:43.920 --> 41:45.119
What is this about?

41:46.599 --> 41:47.760
The movie is about time.

41:47.840 --> 41:48.840
HI! THE PIPES EXPLODED.

41:48.920 --> 41:50.480
IT'S A MESS. YOU CONNED US.
WE LEAVE TODAY.

41:50.559 --> 41:51.880
SORRY BUT WE WON'T DO
THE TRANSFER.

41:51.960 --> 41:56.679
It won't be told literally
because the director likes to pretend

41:56.760 --> 41:59.400
he is always smarter
than the rest of the mortals.

41:59.719 --> 42:00.639
Charlotte!

42:01.920 --> 42:04.440
Let me tell you:
I, having died multiple times,

42:04.519 --> 42:07.840
can tell you that he isn't
smarter than the rest,

42:07.920 --> 42:10.360
-I would say he's a little less smart.
-Charlotte!

42:11.480 --> 42:14.159
-Tell me.
-The tenants have left the house.

42:15.039 --> 42:18.079
I expected a transfer today,
they say they won't pay.

42:18.159 --> 42:20.360
But what are you saying,
has everything exploded already?

42:20.440 --> 42:21.760
Oh, mamma Mia!

42:24.239 --> 42:26.000
Let's continue with the weakest parts.

42:26.519 --> 42:29.119
"But I don't recognize myself,
I don't recognize myself."

42:31.239 --> 42:37.280
"But I don't recognize myself,
I fight, I want to know how to learn."

42:37.360 --> 42:40.920
"I want to know how to learn,
I want to go back to what I've been.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.840
My heart rustles
in a tenacious metamorphosis,

42:44.519 --> 42:47.239
but the desire of being purer endures.

42:48.920 --> 42:51.079
Laila penetrates the enigma,

42:51.679 --> 42:55.880
breaks the illusion,
the heart comes back."

43:03.880 --> 43:06.239
Have you tried
the new Pire PorÃ¡ lotion?

43:06.760 --> 43:07.840
It's fantastic.

43:07.920 --> 43:12.480
It's the only one in the market
that has stem cells and a native flower,

43:14.039 --> 43:17.280
if you buy it in bulk,
it's more convenient.

43:18.880 --> 43:22.960
This lotion is a way to ourselves,

43:23.039 --> 43:28.440
it makes us feel alive,
free, wild, young...

43:28.519 --> 43:32.920
Try it, it worked for me,
what about you?

43:37.079 --> 43:38.599
So? How was I?

43:41.159 --> 43:42.840
I laugh so as not to cry.

43:43.519 --> 43:45.159
Yeah, I'll go get some fresh air

43:45.239 --> 43:47.360
because I'm afraid
I'll give birth right here.

43:48.400 --> 43:50.559
Thank you for coming,
we'll be calling you, thank you.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.199
How do I look?

43:55.360 --> 43:57.239
Majestic, as always.

43:57.960 --> 43:59.199
Coming.

44:18.960 --> 44:20.480
I'm here to see Gaspar Thibert.

44:21.320 --> 44:24.800
Gaspar? Patricio you mean,
I'm Ana.

44:26.840 --> 44:29.320
Do you want some coffee,
some water?

44:29.400 --> 44:31.880
No, no, thanks,
I need to see Gaspar.

44:32.360 --> 44:35.480
No, I don't know where Gaspar is,
well, I have no idea who Gaspar is.

44:35.960 --> 44:40.760
But, we're doing auditions here
and you are perfect for the character.

44:41.599 --> 44:44.159
Have you ever imagined
being the star in a shooting?

44:44.239 --> 44:45.400
A shooting?

44:45.480 --> 44:48.199
Yeah, well, we're promoting
a beauty product.

44:48.920 --> 44:52.119
Tell me,
do you have studies in acting?

44:52.199 --> 44:54.960
Any courses, any workshops?

44:56.360 --> 44:57.360
Excuse me?

44:57.440 --> 44:59.199
Actually,
if you don't it doesn't matter.

45:00.079 --> 45:03.559
No, you're perfect for what we are...
You'll love your role, you'll love it...

45:03.639 --> 45:05.079
I need to see the director.

45:06.079 --> 45:08.320
No, no, no... I'm the director.

45:17.239 --> 45:19.039
Patricio! Patricio!

45:19.480 --> 45:21.480
It's very hard to work from here.

45:22.599 --> 45:27.199
Yeah, yeah, I'll solve it, I promise,
but today I can't.

45:28.239 --> 45:31.800
That's why I'm asking you,
a couple more days and I promise you

45:31.880 --> 45:35.199
I'll transfer you what we owe you.
What?

45:37.559 --> 45:38.719
Let's go.

45:49.679 --> 45:51.559
Charlotte, Charlotte.

45:53.199 --> 45:54.599
We need to go back to the hotel.

45:54.679 --> 45:58.480
We're in trouble, we can't go back
to the hotel or to the house.

45:58.559 --> 46:00.519
I know he'll come back
because his notes are here,

46:00.599 --> 46:01.840
sooner or later
he'll come back.

46:01.920 --> 46:03.960
We're almost out of money, Charlotte.

46:04.400 --> 46:06.679
Because you bought that drone
without letting me know.

46:08.960 --> 46:11.280
-Where's Elena?
-Look, she's gone.

46:11.360 --> 46:13.599
THANK YOU.

46:18.800 --> 46:23.360
Lee, I can't go back now,

46:23.920 --> 46:26.039
I won't dig my
own grave, Lee.

46:28.079 --> 46:29.199
What is this now?

46:32.519 --> 46:33.840
We might be saved. Listen.

46:34.679 --> 46:37.159
You will open the door and say

46:38.000 --> 46:41.679
that I'll do the commercial
if the shooting is at the Lake Hotel.

46:58.199 --> 46:59.119
Lee.

47:00.039 --> 47:01.000
Anything?

47:02.440 --> 47:03.400
Nothing.

47:04.440 --> 47:07.360
Well, get on it
because I'll go mad in here.

47:08.320 --> 47:09.639
Now.

47:10.519 --> 47:12.000
I need a few minutes.

47:12.639 --> 47:13.719
Charlotte.

47:14.719 --> 47:15.719
Charlotte.

47:16.119 --> 47:17.800
We're waiting for you
in the dressing room.

47:17.880 --> 47:19.400
The people at Pire PorÃ¡
are very happy

47:19.480 --> 47:23.239
that you are working with us and they
send you this sample for you to try.

47:25.360 --> 47:26.280
I'll leave it here.

47:27.159 --> 47:28.199
We'll wait for you, okay?

47:34.920 --> 47:35.960
Lake.

47:38.840 --> 47:40.679
Sweets.

47:43.320 --> 47:44.800
To go back.

47:54.119 --> 47:55.800
She likes you.

48:03.199 --> 48:05.760
Look, she's ready.
Gorgeous, I've finished.

48:06.559 --> 48:08.760
Oh, no, you did everything
but your job,

48:09.159 --> 48:11.199
what is that color, those pearls?

48:11.840 --> 48:16.480
She looks distinguished, elegant,
simple, wasn't it what you wanted?

48:16.559 --> 48:21.840
Let's see, girls, I need you to focus,
commercials need more color,

48:21.920 --> 48:24.320
power, strength,
not little pearls and a pink dress.

48:24.400 --> 48:27.079
I know you can do it, okay?
So let's see more options.

48:29.840 --> 48:32.679
Ana, we haven't talked
about what you want.

48:32.760 --> 48:33.960
How do you imagine it?

48:35.440 --> 48:37.440
No, it's isn't anything special.

48:38.239 --> 48:40.760
I need you to look

48:40.840 --> 48:45.360
like a woman who's passionate,
calmed, fresh,

48:45.440 --> 48:50.559
fun but relaxed, like... excited.

48:50.639 --> 48:55.840
Because it's also you, Charlotte,
a diva, but an everyday diva.

48:55.920 --> 48:57.639
I don't know if you get it.

48:57.719 --> 49:01.000
Ana, I think it's important
to dress the character,

49:01.079 --> 49:03.760
colors aren't innocent, obviously.

49:04.440 --> 49:06.960
What's happening to her?
What does she feel?

49:07.039 --> 49:09.000
What disgusts her?

49:09.079 --> 49:13.480
What character do you want to show
to your audience with these lotions?

49:15.119 --> 49:18.639
Okay. With all due respect
for your profession, Charlotte,

49:18.719 --> 49:21.559
this isn't a character,
this is a face that sells.

49:23.320 --> 49:25.360
-Excuse me?
-You're excused.

49:25.440 --> 49:27.440
Patricio can you be in charge
of the actors,

49:27.519 --> 49:28.840
I need to go to the other location.

50:18.679 --> 50:22.480
I can't, Lee, I can't,
tell them I won't be able to shoot,

50:23.400 --> 50:25.360
tell them, the lotion hurt my face.

50:25.440 --> 50:26.960
This is the end, Lee!

50:27.039 --> 50:28.000
This is the end!

50:28.519 --> 50:29.480
The end, I won't do it.

50:29.880 --> 50:31.519
You've heard it,
Charlotte can't do it.

50:32.559 --> 50:34.039
I don't believe it's that grave.

50:34.360 --> 50:35.760
You have no idea.

50:36.239 --> 50:38.519
This is starting
to get ridiculous, eh.

50:38.599 --> 50:41.239
Everything is ridiculous
from the other side.

50:41.719 --> 50:44.960
Well, what can we do to help the lady?

50:45.679 --> 50:46.599
Nothing.

50:48.119 --> 50:49.079
There must be something.

50:49.719 --> 50:51.639
This is a private mourning.

50:51.719 --> 50:54.079
No, no, this isn't a private mourning.
this is her face.

50:54.159 --> 50:55.440
Call it what you want.

50:56.960 --> 50:58.920
Well, how long
will this private mourning last?

50:59.559 --> 51:03.119
I don't know, I could tell you hours
but it could last years,

51:03.199 --> 51:05.079
I could tell you months
and it could last minutes.

51:06.079 --> 51:07.760
No, are you kidding me?

51:07.840 --> 51:11.159
No, this is very selfish
from your part,

51:11.480 --> 51:13.039
I'm sorry, but I'll pass.

51:17.239 --> 51:19.199
Charlotte, Charlotte, she insists.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.199
I won't take it off.

51:26.719 --> 51:29.280
Charlotte,
I need to see how your face is.

51:29.360 --> 51:32.000
If we could help you in any way...

51:32.360 --> 51:36.559
Look, Ana, I'm sorry,
but nobody will see me today.

51:36.960 --> 51:40.639
Well, not today, not tomorrow,
not ever, if this rash doesn't stop.

51:53.559 --> 51:58.000
Sorry,
you should know that I...

51:58.079 --> 51:59.159
I understand.

52:03.519 --> 52:06.000
You dropped this the other day.

52:15.119 --> 52:18.119
I THINK OF YOU EVERY DAY,
FORGIVE ME, I NEEDED TO LEAVE.

52:18.199 --> 52:21.800
I TRUST THE PAIR OF HANDS
THAT TAKES CARE OF YOU...

52:22.159 --> 52:25.880
I took the liberty of writing.

52:43.320 --> 52:46.199
-Beautiful.
-Thank you.

52:57.320 --> 52:59.400
"Soon I will find you.

53:00.320 --> 53:06.400
Or maybe my life is just long enough
to gather the courage to go find you."

53:09.719 --> 53:12.400
But I won't promote
this crappy lotion.

53:18.039 --> 53:19.280
Can I see you, Charlotte?

53:21.599 --> 53:22.760
It's just me.

53:23.239 --> 53:25.000
You can't keep that on forever.

53:25.079 --> 53:28.239
Yes, I can.
It's easy for you to say,

53:28.320 --> 53:32.039
but it's me who's risking my face
and my body, and I'm tired.

53:32.119 --> 53:33.559
But you haven't even started.

53:33.880 --> 53:37.280
And I won't,
because I changed my mind.

53:39.280 --> 53:42.400
Let me see you. Let me see you!

53:49.280 --> 53:52.360
-You don't have anything.
-What if they don't come?

53:54.639 --> 53:58.000
-It's a possibility.
-That possibility can't be!

53:59.639 --> 54:01.760
You always knew you wouldn't do it,
didn't you?

54:03.199 --> 54:05.280
Decisions have weight, Charlotte.

54:05.360 --> 54:07.440
And you're telling me that? Uh?

54:07.840 --> 54:11.199
If you want any of this to make sense,
find the movie!

54:11.800 --> 54:14.760
It's your turn to be
in charge of your life for once,

54:15.239 --> 54:16.920
like everybody else.

54:20.800 --> 54:22.159
I know what's going on,

54:23.320 --> 54:25.360
you're scared of me
going back to cinema,

54:25.440 --> 54:27.400
because you're afraid
I won't need you anymore.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.199
Oh, well!

54:41.360 --> 54:44.239
I couldn't decide between the two,
you know, I'm so hungry,

54:46.039 --> 54:49.679
I eat and eat and eat,
but it seems nothing fills me,

54:49.760 --> 54:52.119
being pregnant is a nightmare.

54:52.199 --> 54:53.960
Really? You look pretty good,

54:54.039 --> 54:55.800
at least on social media
you look pretty good.

54:55.880 --> 54:58.639
Who are you, my aunt?
Social media are full of lies.

55:00.039 --> 55:02.480
Hey, tell me, this director, Gaspar?

55:03.480 --> 55:06.519
Gaspar... Thi, Thi...
I can't remember his last name,

55:06.840 --> 55:08.000
does he know the lady or not?

55:08.079 --> 55:09.519
Darling, did you study cinema or not?

55:09.920 --> 55:12.599
Yes, but I don't know, I don't remember
black and white movies.

55:13.199 --> 55:15.960
They're the most influential duo
in contemporary cinema,

55:16.039 --> 55:19.079
you're working
with a real professional, my love.

55:22.880 --> 55:24.719
With two strings of hair?

55:24.800 --> 55:26.559
With two strings of hair.

55:26.639 --> 55:27.920
With two strings of hair, a braid?

55:28.599 --> 55:30.239
What is true and what is a lie, uh?

55:31.559 --> 55:34.320
-Have you had your heart broken?
-I don't want talk about that, okay?

55:34.840 --> 55:36.199
You broke somebody's heart.

55:39.519 --> 55:41.360
I don't know
if I'll be able to live without him.

55:41.880 --> 55:44.719
Oh, so cliche, of course you'll be able
to live without him.

55:44.800 --> 55:48.039
I swear, I tend to leave
from places that embrace me a little.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.239
No, don't judge yourself. Maybe you
just don't feel like it, period.

55:52.800 --> 55:56.000
You know, all that romanticism,

55:56.840 --> 55:59.519
that whole thing we have
because of those damned commercials...

55:59.599 --> 56:03.920
Please don't blame commercials, okay?
It's our own emotional failure.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.039
And then who?

56:05.119 --> 56:07.400
You know now we can't blame
our parents, so it's like...

56:07.880 --> 56:10.440
I swear,
the only thing I want is to go.

56:12.679 --> 56:13.719
Where?

56:13.800 --> 56:15.880
To go wherever I'm needed,
to the rescue.

56:15.960 --> 56:20.280
I now need this lady to shoot,
and once it's over...

56:21.440 --> 56:23.639
My love, you need to know
all this is a about egos,

56:23.719 --> 56:28.199
once you learn to handle them
you'll dominate cinema.

56:30.480 --> 56:31.840
This stays between you and me.

56:34.800 --> 56:37.079
Here, you can tell her
this is a gift from Gaspar.

56:40.960 --> 56:43.079
And you think this will make her
come back to the set?

56:43.719 --> 56:46.599
Look, I promise
that when all this is over

56:46.679 --> 56:48.280
we'll go on a vacation,
just the two of us.

56:48.880 --> 56:51.440
Just the two of us? Okay...

56:55.039 --> 56:57.320
Have you thought about
what you'll do when the baby is born?

57:00.679 --> 57:03.519
No, right now I have no time
and my only concern is this lady.

57:06.840 --> 57:09.239
But thank you for rescuing me.

57:09.559 --> 57:10.639
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

57:18.079 --> 57:22.159
You have nothing on your face.
Incredible.

57:29.960 --> 57:31.440
I have something for you.

57:36.199 --> 57:37.719
From Gaspar Thibert.

57:50.440 --> 57:53.159
Tomorrow
I'll be waiting for you on set.

58:08.079 --> 58:09.480
"Who are you?

58:11.800 --> 58:15.159
Hey, talk
to me!

58:15.840 --> 58:20.679
I'm lost too,
maybe together we can do it."

58:26.039 --> 58:31.840
"Go, human, live."

58:35.840 --> 58:39.039
"My name is Laila, Laila I said.

58:41.519 --> 58:45.280
Look at me, look at me, Miniature."

58:45.360 --> 58:46.840
"I see you."

58:50.679 --> 58:52.920
"We can fight,
but only if we're together.

58:54.320 --> 58:55.920
Do you know what time is?

58:56.880 --> 59:01.679
Have you been with it,
do you know the truth behind men,

59:04.079 --> 59:09.480
take me to time, please Miniature,
please, take me."

59:13.639 --> 59:14.920
Lee.

59:18.239 --> 59:19.159
Lee!

59:25.480 --> 59:26.920
Charlotte to Lee.

59:30.960 --> 59:34.599
-THANK YOU.
-FROM ME, TOO.

59:36.840 --> 59:37.800
Lee!?

59:40.400 --> 59:41.519
Lee!

1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:05.159
This lotion is a journey
to ourselves,

1:01:05.599 --> 1:01:09.599
it makes us feel free, alive,
wild, young.

1:01:09.679 --> 1:01:12.039
It works for me,
what about you?

1:01:14.119 --> 1:01:19.239
Cut! Good, good,
you look better when you're tired.

1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:35.239
Try the new Pire PorÃ¡,
it feels so soft and light.

1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:36.960
It's the only one in the market

1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:38.920
that has stem cells
from a native flower.

1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:42.280
Now available
in the "friendship" pack,

1:01:42.360 --> 1:01:43.960
it's more
convenient.

1:01:44.599 --> 1:01:48.239
This lotion is a way to ourselves,

1:01:48.320 --> 1:01:52.199
it makes us feel free, wild, young...

1:01:53.519 --> 1:01:55.800
-What have you done?
-No, don't look at that.

1:01:56.599 --> 1:01:58.599
No, no, don't look at that, here.

1:01:58.679 --> 1:02:00.599
What have you done?
This isn't me.

1:02:01.039 --> 1:02:02.960
Patricio, turn the monitors off.

1:02:06.440 --> 1:02:08.320
I won't do this commercial, Ana.

1:02:08.400 --> 1:02:12.840
I won't.
I quit, this is impossible.

1:02:13.719 --> 1:02:17.159
Look, Charlotte,
doing this commercial is good for you

1:02:17.239 --> 1:02:20.440
because people will see you
after forty years.

1:02:20.519 --> 1:02:23.559
But this is too obvious,
you think people are stupid?

1:02:24.639 --> 1:02:26.639
-Well, but this is how...
- What are you doing?

1:02:27.039 --> 1:02:30.920
Charlotte, this is how commercials are,
we need them to sell, it's advertising.

1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:38.239
Okay, but I won't sell this crap,
because it's a lie, that's why.

1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.159
Well, we need to adapt,
this is how...

1:02:41.239 --> 1:02:43.400
You're underestimating people,
adapt to what?

1:02:43.480 --> 1:02:45.920
We've done the shittiest things
to ourselves in order to adapt,

1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:47.840
no, I refuse it. It's over, Ana.

1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:51.960
Charlotte, this is a job like any other,
you have to do it.

1:02:53.159 --> 1:02:54.599
Yes, it's a job,

1:02:54.679 --> 1:02:57.400
but you'll never be good at your job
if you lie to people, Ana.

1:02:57.480 --> 1:03:00.039
Well, you'll never
star in that movie, you know?

1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:04.440
MarÃ­a Carmen GutiÃ©rrez,
you have to come with us.

1:03:07.280 --> 1:03:10.519
Former diva known as Charlotte Grimar
has been arrested in AsunciÃ³n

1:03:10.599 --> 1:03:12.800
as the only witness
of the unusual death

1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:14.760
of a renowned
Argentine psychotherapist.

1:03:15.679 --> 1:03:17.880
Here we see Mrs. Grimar
coming this way,

1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:19.159
we'll ask her some questions.

1:03:20.400 --> 1:03:22.599
Mrs. Charlotte? A couple questions?

1:03:28.599 --> 1:03:30.760
-Why did you leave your country?
-What country?

1:03:30.840 --> 1:03:32.440
What would you say
to people who think

1:03:32.519 --> 1:03:34.599
this is a press move
to come back to the screen?

1:03:34.920 --> 1:03:38.199
What relationship do you have with
the deceased, Dr. Claudio Goldberg?

1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:39.920
None.

1:03:41.719 --> 1:03:42.880
Do you deny knowing him?

1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:46.400
I don't deny knowing him,
I deny having a relationship with him.

1:03:46.480 --> 1:03:47.480
DENIAL OF TIES.

1:03:47.559 --> 1:03:50.840
Is it true that you devoted yourself
to adopting Asian orphaned kids?

1:03:50.920 --> 1:03:52.119
A MOVIE-LIKE SCANDAL

1:03:52.199 --> 1:03:56.320
If I had to mention the circumstances
under which Lee and I met,

1:03:56.840 --> 1:03:58.639
It was him who took care of me.

1:03:58.719 --> 1:04:01.880
They're saying that you would've stolen
some pills from his office,

1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:04.639
where they for selling
or for personal use?

1:04:09.199 --> 1:04:12.360
You crossed the river
in order to avoid Immigration, right?

1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:13.679
What's the reason?

1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:15.880
I'm only moved by an enormous longing.

1:04:24.239 --> 1:04:26.840
Is it true that you visited
Dr. Goldberg's office

1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:28.800
because you suffered from addictions?

1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:33.679
No, I did it
because my memories came back.

1:04:33.760 --> 1:04:34.840
What memories?

1:04:34.920 --> 1:04:36.440
FAMOUS MOVIE STAR
ARRESTED IN PARAGUAY.

1:04:36.519 --> 1:04:40.719
My memories come back all together
and sometimes, because they're broken,

1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:43.679
they all melt together and they do
whatever they want with me,

1:04:43.760 --> 1:04:45.239
they make fun of me.

1:05:13.960 --> 1:05:16.840
Do you have any theories
about his death?

1:05:16.920 --> 1:05:19.519
He was a human being,
we're all born to die.

1:05:19.599 --> 1:05:21.480
Is it true you visited
the Doctor's office...

1:05:25.800 --> 1:05:27.360
We're all born to die...

1:05:30.559 --> 1:05:35.840
Alive, wild, young. It works for me,
what about you?

1:05:40.079 --> 1:05:41.719
We're all born to die.

1:05:42.519 --> 1:05:44.280
You have the right
to make one phone call.

1:05:46.280 --> 1:05:49.239
-Who would you like to call?
-Lee.

1:06:08.880 --> 1:06:13.039
I'LL BUY YOU A COFFEE
WHEN HE LEAVES.

1:06:16.199 --> 1:06:17.280
Who is it?

1:06:19.920 --> 1:06:21.360
So you've killed a man?

1:06:24.079 --> 1:06:26.480
I don't want to see
any more journalists, please.

1:06:26.960 --> 1:06:29.159
I never thought I'd hear you
say that phrase.

1:06:35.760 --> 1:06:38.360
Gaspar, you're old.

1:06:40.119 --> 1:06:41.440
And you're in jail.

1:06:41.519 --> 1:06:45.480
It's just the precinct, but yes,
jail sounds better.

1:06:50.840 --> 1:06:52.920
Nobody understands anything
about what happened.

1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:58.559
The whole Interpol was mobilized,
I've always feared you,

1:06:58.639 --> 1:07:00.119
but now I fear you more.

1:07:00.639 --> 1:07:02.599
I read your script, Gaspar.

1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:07.079
-Is that why you came to Paraguay?
-Yes, to retrieve what's mine.

1:07:07.159 --> 1:07:08.840
What were you doing?

1:07:09.679 --> 1:07:11.440
A personal revenge?

1:07:11.519 --> 1:07:13.920
Something like that?
Miniature, why Miniature?

1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:15.320
Why not any other movie?

1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:18.559
No, it could have not been
any other movie and you know it.

1:07:19.159 --> 1:07:21.159
It's my farewell to the cinema world.

1:07:24.679 --> 1:07:26.559
Why does everything need to revolve
around you?

1:07:26.639 --> 1:07:30.079
-It doesn't revolve just around me.
-Oh, no? And then who?

1:07:31.519 --> 1:07:33.679
That character is you.

1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:38.159
Oh, Gaspar. I'm in pieces.

1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:41.440
I love your pieces.

1:07:42.119 --> 1:07:45.159
Oh Gaspar, don't get started,
you're a married man.

1:07:46.079 --> 1:07:47.840
What does that have to do with it?
I haven't said anything.

1:07:47.920 --> 1:07:51.880
I'm not your story,
I don't want to be your story anymore.

1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:54.920
But you're way more
than a story in my life.

1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:56.280
What am I?

1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:01.880
A parenthesis?
What was I?

1:08:03.199 --> 1:08:05.159
I was so afraid
of breaking the illusion.

1:08:06.760 --> 1:08:09.239
Being just an illusion can be
very destructive, Gaspar

1:08:11.679 --> 1:08:14.360
You and I weren't made for reality.

1:08:16.159 --> 1:08:19.720
Why didn't you call me
when I left for Argentina?

1:08:21.159 --> 1:08:22.279
You didn't call.

1:08:26.560 --> 1:08:28.720
Will you be in the movie?

1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:32.560
I didn't travel this far in vain,
didn't I?

1:08:33.079 --> 1:08:34.439
I came to do it.

1:08:43.960 --> 1:08:45.199
Gaspar.

1:08:49.119 --> 1:08:50.479
I'll choose
the role.

1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:57.359
There's an Asian waiting for you
at the entrance.

1:09:27.720 --> 1:09:29.119
My name is Laila.

1:09:32.239 --> 1:09:33.359
Laila, I said.

1:09:35.800 --> 1:09:36.960
Look at me.

1:09:40.760 --> 1:09:42.479
Look at me, Miniature.

1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:47.760
You've been with him, haven't you?

1:09:56.560 --> 1:09:58.720
Do you know what time is?

1:10:04.439 --> 1:10:07.800
Please, I know you know
what I need to know.

1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:16.279
If you want me to take you to time,

1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:19.680
yo need to know this:

1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:23.760
Once you're in time,

1:10:25.159 --> 1:10:31.119
you'll be its guardian
and you'll belong to it.

1:10:35.359 --> 1:10:37.000
Take me to it.

1:10:39.600 --> 1:10:43.199
Please, please, Miniature.

1:10:47.039 --> 1:10:50.199
You'll have to prove
that you're worthy.

1:10:54.239 --> 1:10:55.920
What about you?

1:11:01.199 --> 1:11:04.359
I will finally be free.

1:11:12.319 --> 1:11:17.880
Free! Free, human.

1:11:30.359 --> 1:11:34.000
Try the new Pire PorÃ¡,
it feels so soft and light.

1:11:34.079 --> 1:11:35.359
It's the only one in the market

1:11:35.439 --> 1:11:37.680
that has stem cells
from a native flower,

1:11:38.039 --> 1:11:40.479
Now available
in the "friendship" pack,

1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:41.640
it's more convenient.

1:11:43.279 --> 1:11:44.840
BEFORE - AFTER

1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:50.439
This lotion is a journey to ourselves,
it makes us feel free, alive, young...

1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:52.239
It works for me,
what about you?

1:11:52.760 --> 1:11:54.640
WE ARE ALL BORN TO DIE.
