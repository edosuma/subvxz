WEBVTT

01:30.458 --> 01:32.426
Whoa!

01:35.696 --> 01:37.798
Hey, there's no one
driving that thing!

01:38.699 --> 01:39.699
Ho!

01:44.205 --> 01:46.174
Someone stop it!

01:48.509 --> 01:51.445
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Easy.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.582
Easy, boy.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.722
That was scary.
Officer!

02:01.789 --> 02:03.857
Good. I've never seen
such a thing.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.295
Shouldn't we bring those boys
in or something?

02:07.361 --> 02:09.497
Trust me, whatever
punishment we give them,

02:09.562 --> 02:11.375
it's nothing compared to what's
waiting for them at home.

02:11.399 --> 02:13.599
Those boys know if anything
was to happen to that horse,

02:13.634 --> 02:14.768
if it got injured,

02:14.835 --> 02:17.371
the whole family would lose
its ability to plow the field,

02:17.438 --> 02:19.006
make food for the winter.

02:19.072 --> 02:21.409
So that's it?

02:21.475 --> 02:24.011
They're just gonna feel
really, really guilty?

02:24.077 --> 02:25.379
Mm. It works.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.781
Believe me.
It won't happen again.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.652
I guess growing up here,
you know all this stuff.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.888
You have no idea.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.870
Where are we?

02:51.004 --> 02:52.573
Ohio, somewhere.

02:56.076 --> 02:59.347
I miss Mommy.

02:59.413 --> 03:02.049
I know. Me too.
Me too, buddy.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.521
I got to get you
something for that cough.

03:13.927 --> 03:17.465
I have to go to the bathroom.
I have to go bad.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.533
Hang on, buddy.
Hang on.

03:24.137 --> 03:25.406
I have to go pee.

03:25.473 --> 03:27.708
All right.
Where's your bathroom?
I have to go pee.

03:27.775 --> 03:30.244
- Oh, it's right back there.
- Thank you. Thank you.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.480
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

03:43.123 --> 03:44.692
I don't know.

04:18.190 --> 04:19.860
I know you don't
want to talk about it.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.630
But you can't
keep putting it off.
You have to decide.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.698
What is there to decide?

04:25.966 --> 04:27.935
You guys should be
enjoying your time now.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.938
You can't keep
killing yourselves
running this old inn.

04:31.004 --> 04:35.909
Who will I cook for
if we close the inn?
Fate, we will have no guests.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.612
That's the point.
Aunt Lydia, you wouldn't
have to cook anymore.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.982
I love to cook.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.654
The three of you
have been taking care of me
since I was 10 years old.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.889
I don't know what
I would do without you.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.158
- You're family.
- And you're my family.

04:51.224 --> 04:53.327
So listen to me, please?

04:53.394 --> 04:56.196
I would like to help.
I have a little money.

04:56.263 --> 04:58.732
This inn was built
by your grandfather.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.902
We have been running it
for decades.

05:01.969 --> 05:05.005
And just last week,
you fell down the stairs
carrying the chamber pot.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.375
Well, at least it wasn't full.

05:09.743 --> 05:13.547
That is not even remotely funny.
You could have broken your neck.
You could have.

05:13.614 --> 05:16.884
Honest work is from God.
Ja.

05:16.950 --> 05:20.421
Just... so afraid.

05:20.488 --> 05:23.190
If anything were to happen
to any one of you...

05:23.256 --> 05:26.527
Don't want Rachel to be afraid.

05:31.532 --> 05:34.735
Ugh.

05:38.472 --> 05:41.909
- Dad, look! Horsey!

05:43.777 --> 05:46.647
Whoa!

05:48.281 --> 05:50.618
You are having trouble?

05:50.684 --> 05:53.086
Uh, trouble?
Yeah.

05:53.153 --> 05:56.223
Do you know where
the nearest town is?
I can't get a signal.

05:56.289 --> 05:59.460
Yeah. Sugarcreek,
two miles that way.

06:05.198 --> 06:08.569
You stay here.
I know a mechanic.
I'll send him to you.

06:08.636 --> 06:10.804
Great. Thank you.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.073
Hyah. Hyah.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.953
It is a difficult thing you ask.

06:29.990 --> 06:30.990
Okay.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.730
We will close the inn
to paying guests.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.034
Thank you.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.737
On one condition.

06:45.439 --> 06:49.276
That if we have reason
to believe that God has put
a stranger at our door,

06:49.342 --> 06:52.746
we will not turn
that stranger away.

06:52.813 --> 06:55.148
But...
That is scripture.

06:56.450 --> 06:59.419
There is no compromise
in doing God's will.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.028
Agreed.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.504
**

07:16.570 --> 07:18.939
You want the good news
or the bad news?

07:20.140 --> 07:22.676
Good news...
I can fix it.

07:22.743 --> 07:25.946
Bad news...
You got a blown
head gasket.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.782
It'll take a day or two
to pull the engine head
and resurface it,

07:28.849 --> 07:32.119
a day to get it back in,
plus I gotta order
the parts.

07:32.185 --> 07:35.055
- That's another day or so.
- How much is that all
gonna cost?

07:35.122 --> 07:38.291
I'd say you're looking
at about $400.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.499
Yeah. Go ahead
and order the parts.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.169
I'm gonna need a deposit.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.571
Yeah, sure.

07:50.638 --> 07:54.441
**

07:54.508 --> 07:55.576
Hang on.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.615
You got my wallet?

08:02.783 --> 08:07.621
No? Uh, hey, I know this
is going to sound funny,

08:07.688 --> 08:10.123
but, uh, I think
somebody stole my wallet.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.860
You want to use the phone?
Call somebody?

08:12.926 --> 08:16.029
I don't really have
anybody to call.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.800
Well, police station's
right down the street.

08:26.540 --> 08:31.745
Um, can I just leave this here
a couple of days till I can
figure something out?

08:38.986 --> 08:41.254
Pull it around back.
But only for a couple
days.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.334
Is there anyplace cheap
to stay around here?

08:45.358 --> 08:47.561
There isn't even
an expensive place
to stay right now.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.763
Everything's booked up
for the Swiss Festival.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.999
This place is crawling
with tourists.

08:53.433 --> 08:56.169
There's a campground
a couple of miles
up the road.

08:56.236 --> 08:59.573
They might have a spot,
if you don't mind
roughing it.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.441
**

09:01.508 --> 09:03.543
I don't really have
much of a choice.

09:04.578 --> 09:05.713
Thanks.

09:05.779 --> 09:09.983
**

09:10.050 --> 09:12.452
Daddy, I'm tired.

09:12.519 --> 09:16.824
I know, buddy.
We'll find someplace to rest
real soon. I promise.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.965
Whoa. Ah, wie geht's?
Oh.

09:25.032 --> 09:28.001
We meet again.
Where is your vehicle?

09:28.068 --> 09:31.271
Uh, turns out we did
have trouble after all.

09:31.338 --> 09:35.242
Ah. Perhaps you should buy
a good horse and buggy, eh?

09:35.308 --> 09:37.444
Now right now that doesn't
sound like a bad idea.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.847
- Oh.

09:39.913 --> 09:43.183
Oh, your boy is ill.
Where are you going?

09:43.250 --> 09:46.620
Ah, the guy says there's
a campground a couple
miles up the road here.

09:46.687 --> 09:50.858
Oh, nein, nein.
A campground is no place
for a sick child.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.160
He should have a roof
over his head.

09:53.226 --> 09:57.364
Well, even if I could
find a place, I don't
have much money, so...

09:57.430 --> 09:59.800
Ah.

10:02.569 --> 10:06.707
Hmm. Come. Come.
I know a place.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.709
Yeah, come.
It's good.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.784
I am Eli Troyler,
and this is Rosey.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.952
I'm Joe Matthews.
This is my son, Bobby.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.921
Good to meet you, Joe Matthews.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.474
How was lunch?

10:41.541 --> 10:43.543
Ah, very filling.

10:43.610 --> 10:47.180
How do you guys read that stuff?
It'll turn your brains to mush.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.849
We're keeping up
with current events.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.319
Rachel, Kim,

10:52.385 --> 10:55.122
we need to go over the logistics
for the festival next weekend.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.592
I'm thinking if we close off
Main Street right here
on the east end,

10:59.659 --> 11:02.638
force all the traffic up
on the right here, we've got
this additional parking area.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.397
So we need
a couple of barricades.

11:11.538 --> 11:14.341
I must go, Joe Matthews.
It is past time for milking.

11:14.407 --> 11:17.978
Oh, no, what about the...
My cousins will take
good care of you.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.215
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!

11:24.251 --> 11:25.853
I'm Anna.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.289
Hi. I'm Joe.
This is Bobby.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.359
We got cookies.
Come on!

11:32.425 --> 11:33.693
Ja, ja.

11:43.904 --> 11:48.541
There is no electricity.
This is our way.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.643
I understand, but, um...

11:50.710 --> 11:54.347
Still it will be good,
I think, for you
and your boy, yes?

11:54.414 --> 11:57.851
I don't... I mean, yeah,
it's gonna be great.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.586
So you will stay.

11:59.652 --> 12:02.155
Uh, how much do you charge?

12:02.222 --> 12:05.658
Oh, Eli explained
your situation.

12:07.627 --> 12:11.698
You're tired. You will
have dinner with us and then
get a good night's rest.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.934
We can discuss payment
in the morning.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.870
You mean, seriously?

12:16.937 --> 12:21.508
I'm Bertha, this is Lydia,
and our sister Anna is with
your boy on the swing.

12:25.813 --> 12:28.816
Okay. Um, but, uh,
ma'am, I, uh...

12:28.882 --> 12:30.784
You are welcome.

12:36.589 --> 12:40.560
I'm told we can expect an even
bigger crowd than last year,
upwards of 60,000 people.

12:40.627 --> 12:43.106
Well, I called
the sheriff's department.
They have people standing by.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.832
E.M.T.'s are on notice.
Good.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.934
Rachel, your aunt's
on the phone.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.571
Kim, write down what
we want over here, okay?
Hello?

12:51.638 --> 12:56.043
Rachel, you will come
to dinner, ja?

12:56.109 --> 12:59.546
Aunt Lydia, I told you
you don't have to shout.
Remember?

12:59.612 --> 13:04.084
Bertha says you must meet Joe.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.253
Who's Joe?

13:21.068 --> 13:23.904
Ooh!

13:23.971 --> 13:28.041
Hi, Rachel. This...
This is Bobby.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.143
He's staying with us.

13:31.211 --> 13:35.615
- His dad has no money.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.250
Yeah.
Where is Bobby's dad?

13:37.317 --> 13:42.956
Oh, good. Rachel is here.
Rachel is our niece.

13:43.023 --> 13:47.560
Rachel, this is Joe Matthews.

13:49.629 --> 13:50.763
Officer.

13:58.805 --> 14:01.274
Want more All right.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.545
Delta 107, I got that info...

14:05.612 --> 14:07.547
Mm.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.750
So, Joe, what brings you
to Sugarcreek?

14:10.817 --> 14:12.419
You here for the Swiss Festival?

14:12.485 --> 14:16.223
Um, just passing through.
My truck broke down.

14:16.289 --> 14:19.559
You'll be moving on then?
As soon as it's
fixed, yeah.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.031
- I haven't decided.

14:29.502 --> 14:32.205
- Oh, Rachel, so many questions.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.841
Let the man eat.
I'm just talking.

14:34.908 --> 14:36.676
Yeah?
Just talking.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.145
Right, Joe?

14:38.211 --> 14:41.114
Well, let's just say
we're between addresses.

14:43.917 --> 14:45.118
Where's Bobby's mom?

14:45.185 --> 14:47.887
My mommy's in heaven.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.232
Uh, save room for dessert.

14:59.299 --> 15:02.635
Mmm!
Oh, and tomorrow...

15:02.702 --> 15:04.571
I'll show you the kitties.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.107
Yay! Meow.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.977
Meow.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.114
Meow?
Meow.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.818
Thank you, ma'am.
That was a delicious dinner.

15:18.885 --> 15:21.554
It's been a rough day.
You just made it
a whole lot better.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.556
Danke.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.826
First thing tomorrow,
we'll talk about how
I'm gonna pay for this.

15:26.893 --> 15:29.662
But right now,
I'm just gonna get
this little guy to bed.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.166
Would it be all right
if I spent the night tonight?

15:33.233 --> 15:36.503
Of course.
You are always welcome.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.173
Good night, Officer.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.950
Remember,
if you need anything,
I'll be right here.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.563
I thought we agreed
to close the inn.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.265
We agreed, yes.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.534
Then what's he doing here?

16:07.600 --> 16:11.938
We also agreed that
we would not turn away
strangers.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.541
That man is no angel.
Trust me.

16:14.607 --> 16:17.844
So suspicious all the time.

16:17.910 --> 16:20.013
Joe and his son
are down on their luck.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.115
There is no shame in that.

16:22.182 --> 16:25.452
I know that you're trying
to help, but we don't know
anything about him.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.089
This is God's world, Rachel.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.891
He has put him into
our lives for a reason.

16:31.958 --> 16:34.694
It is not for us
to question that reason.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.464
All right. All right.
Well, promise me then...

16:37.530 --> 16:39.732
that you won't let him
in the house unless I'm here.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.603
At least until I find out
more about him.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.073
How will you do that?

16:48.741 --> 16:50.077
I'll ask him.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.823
Grant, it's me.
Yeah, we're fine.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.358
I know they're
looking for me.
That's why I left.

17:06.425 --> 17:09.362
Do you have any news?
Listen. Listen.

17:09.429 --> 17:12.299
How many time do I gotta
tell you? They don't
have any evidence.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.401
They have absolutely
no proof that I did it.

17:15.902 --> 17:19.071
Well, just call Chloe
and tell her to pay you
whatever you need.

17:19.138 --> 17:22.008
Okay, Grant?
Whatever it takes.
I don't care.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.211
All right. I'll call you
in a couple days.

17:36.022 --> 17:37.690
Mommy?

17:41.060 --> 17:43.563
Hey, buddy, you okay?

17:43.630 --> 17:44.897
I called Mommy.

17:44.964 --> 17:48.501
I know. I heard you.
But it's okay now.
I'm here.

17:48.568 --> 17:52.505
Would you stay with me,
please, for a little while?

17:52.572 --> 17:54.207
Yeah. Sure.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.643
Good night, Daddy.
Good night, bud.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.455
What are you doing?

18:44.557 --> 18:46.526
Oh, uh, well,
I told your aunts...

18:46.593 --> 18:48.561
that I would repair some
stuff around the place...

18:48.628 --> 18:51.264
to help pay for
the use of the cabin.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.603
Huh? These two
are really hitting it off.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.605
It's the mama cat.

19:01.308 --> 19:05.144
Children love Anna.
She has a kind heart.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.914
Yeah, they all do.
They're really good people.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.869
They believe in seeing
the good in people.
That's their way.

19:13.720 --> 19:14.720
How about you?

19:16.022 --> 19:17.257
Me?

19:18.558 --> 19:21.361
If anything were to happen
to any one of them,

19:21.428 --> 19:23.339
I would make sure to find
the person responsible.

19:23.363 --> 19:28.435
Hey, look. You don't know me.
I don't blame you
for being suspicious.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.701
But you don't gotta worry.
I would never hurt anybody...

19:30.737 --> 19:33.273
as kind and generous
as your aunts.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.976
Okay, well, if you don't
have anything to hide,

19:37.043 --> 19:38.721
how about I take a look
at your driver's license?

19:38.745 --> 19:42.382
Believe me.
If I could do that,
I wouldn't be here.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.952
- My wallet got stolen.

19:46.018 --> 19:50.089
- I lost my money, my I.D.
- That's pretty convenient.

19:50.156 --> 19:52.959
Not for me.
Really inconvenient,

19:53.025 --> 19:56.363
especially when I'm being
accused of something I'm not.

19:57.297 --> 20:01.067
Joe? Have you
finished the ladder?

20:01.133 --> 20:02.569
Almost.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.871
The only reason
I don't run you
outta here right now...

20:04.937 --> 20:07.350
is 'cause they have it
in their heads they're supposed
to help you and your son.

20:07.374 --> 20:10.254
As long as you're here,
I'm gonna be watching you.
You just remember that.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.178
How could I forget?

20:12.245 --> 20:13.880
Rachel.
I'm sorry.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.716
I'm going to head in to work.
I'll be back.

20:16.783 --> 20:19.619
Ugh, our Rachel's
always in a hurry.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.655
It's hard to believe that
you two are even related.

20:22.722 --> 20:26.559
Her father, our brother Frank...
He too was a policeman.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.295
Was?

20:32.365 --> 20:34.534
That is not my story to tell.

20:37.670 --> 20:40.039
Now, I think the yard
needs to be trimmed, yes?

20:40.106 --> 20:42.008
Yeah. Happy to do it.

20:43.109 --> 20:46.413
Good. The scythe
is in the barn.

20:48.581 --> 20:49.616
Scythe?

22:25.445 --> 22:27.514
I'm calling
about a Joe Matthews.

22:29.382 --> 22:32.728
If you've never heard of him,
why is he driving a truck
registered to your dealership?

22:32.752 --> 22:36.456
No, no, no. Don't hang up.
Hello

22:40.159 --> 22:41.528
Who's Joe Matthews?

22:42.895 --> 22:45.364
This guy who spent the night
at my aunts' house last night.

22:45.432 --> 22:50.369
He's got no money, no I.D.,
bad habit of not answering
a question.

22:50.437 --> 22:51.838
None of which makes him
a criminal.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.950
I overheard a phone conversation
he had last night.

22:54.974 --> 22:57.553
He was trying to convince
somebody that he wasn't
guilty of something.

22:57.577 --> 22:59.812
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.

22:59.879 --> 23:03.416
I just called the car
dealership, but they've
never heard of him.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.586
Listen. I know
I'm new and all,

23:06.653 --> 23:08.521
but I have a real
knack for this stuff.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.457
Uh, I don't know.

23:10.523 --> 23:13.092
Trust me. Okay, so
his name is Joe Matthews.

23:13.159 --> 23:15.294
Texas plates.
What else?

23:15.361 --> 23:19.999
Uh, he's about 6'2",
brown hair, solid.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.902
He's got a son, Bobby.
He's about five.

23:24.737 --> 23:25.772
And...

23:26.939 --> 23:27.874
And what?

23:27.940 --> 23:30.710
Oh, he's got this long hair,
scruffy beard.

23:30.777 --> 23:34.213
Dresses like he just
crawled out of a Dumpster,
but he's wearing $300 sneakers.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.414
Huh.

23:38.150 --> 23:41.153
Go do what you gotta do.
I'll let you know
when I find something.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.469
That is lain, Englischer.
Wrong.

23:56.536 --> 23:59.105
Wrong? Yeah,
kind of figured that.

23:59.171 --> 24:01.173
Here, I will show you.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.745
Be my guest.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.982
You must twist
at the waist.
Okay.

24:10.049 --> 24:13.052
Keep the blade level
with the ground, eh?
Okay.

24:14.353 --> 24:16.523
Twist at the waist.
Uh-huh.

24:16.589 --> 24:19.158
Keep the blade level
with the ground, yeah?

24:19.225 --> 24:21.594
Now you try.
Okay.

24:26.098 --> 24:28.835
Ja. Better.

24:29.902 --> 24:32.772
- Oh, yeah.
Good.

24:32.839 --> 24:35.041
- I got this. I got this.
- Better. Good.

24:38.177 --> 24:41.948
Where are you?
In case you haven't noticed,

24:42.014 --> 24:45.251
the press is having a field day
with this disappearing act.

24:45.317 --> 24:48.287
If they thought you had
something to do with Grace's
murder before,

24:48.354 --> 24:50.590
now they're practically
a lynch mob.

24:50.657 --> 24:53.926
I'm not just your business
manager. I'm worried sick
about you and Bobby.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.563
- Come home.

24:56.629 --> 24:58.831
We'll get this
all straightened out.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.066
Ahem.

25:01.601 --> 25:04.604
And Dylan's here.
Call me.

25:07.139 --> 25:09.441
Are you sure you don't
know where he is?

25:09.508 --> 25:11.611
He doesn't confide in me.
You know that.

25:11.678 --> 25:15.014
Maybe if you stopped trying
to get him to invest in those
ridiculous business deals.

25:15.081 --> 25:16.883
Those were legitimate
opportunities.

25:16.949 --> 25:19.886
Dylan, I don't
have time for this.
Why are you here?

25:19.952 --> 25:23.155
He's my brother.
You're not the only one
worried about him.

25:23.222 --> 25:28.995
And he said
anytime I came up short,
you know, with expenses...

25:35.602 --> 25:36.603
How much?

25:38.304 --> 25:41.741
**

25:56.455 --> 25:59.125
Kim, I thought
you were good at this.

25:59.191 --> 26:02.328
Right. Well, what about
Bobby and Joe Matthews?

26:04.964 --> 26:07.734
All right. Well, call me
as soon as you know
something, okay?

26:08.935 --> 26:10.637
Okay.

26:10.703 --> 26:13.305
**

26:23.916 --> 26:25.217
Reminds me of church.

26:27.286 --> 26:32.124
Mm. Where will you go
when your vehicle is fixed?

26:32.191 --> 26:33.826
Haven't decided yet.

26:33.893 --> 26:35.828
And your wife,
what does she say?

26:40.399 --> 26:41.968
My wife died five months ago.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.103
Been traveling around
ever since.

26:46.105 --> 26:52.044
Yeah, it is a hard thing
to lose someone you love.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.714
But it is not possible
to run away from grief.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.085
Well, I haven't had
any better ideas.

27:02.388 --> 27:05.792
I think you should stay
with us a while. Hmm?

27:09.128 --> 27:12.732
I must tend to my own work.
I will see you again,
Joe Matthews.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.266
Thank you, Eli.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.923
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.091
Some crazy eights.
Do you like crazy eights?

27:39.158 --> 27:42.361
* Duh, duh, duh * No, you lost.

27:42.428 --> 27:44.596
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Beautiful singing voice.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.499
- Oh, Rachel.

27:47.566 --> 27:50.703
- Come in. Join us.
- Rachel, come, come, come. Sit.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.939
I can't stay. There's
a million people downtown.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.441
I just wanted to see
how things were going.

27:55.507 --> 28:00.046
Our Joe's been working
so hard for us, we invited him
and Bobby to stay another night.

28:00.112 --> 28:02.281
- Ja.

28:02.348 --> 28:06.285
And we were saying
how he should take Bobby
to town for the festival.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.354
- Oh, the music!
- * Duh, duh, duh *

28:08.420 --> 28:11.557
And the rides! Whoo!

28:11.623 --> 28:13.359
Such fun for the boy.

28:13.425 --> 28:16.228
Can we, Dad

28:18.197 --> 28:20.099
Are you sure you feel up to it?

28:20.166 --> 28:23.435
- Yeah. I feel great.
- All right.

28:23.502 --> 28:25.772
Let's go get cleaned up.
Come on.

28:27.106 --> 28:29.441
Maybe we'll see you
there, Officer.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.177
I'm sure you will.

28:31.243 --> 28:34.847
Oh, may I get your...
Thank you, dear.

28:34.914 --> 28:37.750
I wash. You dry.
Okay.

28:37.817 --> 28:38.918
Okay? Good.

28:45.758 --> 28:48.294
Ooh, look at you.
All Nancy Drew.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.863
Aren't you supposed to be
herding tourists or something?

28:50.930 --> 28:54.466
Hey, Kim, do me a favor.
As soon as I get a clean print,
I want you to scan it.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.979
It's gonna take a while
to find a match, and I
have to get back out there.

28:57.003 --> 28:59.338
But as soon as you get a hit,
I want you to call me.

29:03.309 --> 29:06.979
Mr. Joe Matthews
will no longer be a mystery man.

29:07.046 --> 29:10.749
**

29:28.901 --> 29:31.537
**

29:31.603 --> 29:33.505
What's that?

29:33.572 --> 29:38.777
Uh, "steen, stow, sten."
But I don't know
what that means.

29:38.845 --> 29:42.514
Steinstossen.
It means "stone toss."

29:42.581 --> 29:44.083
It's a old tradition
around here.

29:44.150 --> 29:46.718
Officer.
What a surprise.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.855
Mr. Matthews.
Hi, Bobby.

29:48.921 --> 29:52.224
What do they throw the rocks at?

29:52.291 --> 29:54.093
Let me show you.

29:58.998 --> 30:02.401
How heavy?
Hundred and 38
pounds exactly.

30:02.468 --> 30:05.271
Record stood for eight years...
14 feet, six inches.

30:05.337 --> 30:08.307
Eight feet, two inches.

30:10.042 --> 30:12.644
You guys take your rock throwing
pretty seriously.

30:12.711 --> 30:15.447
Well, there's prize money.
It's a hundred dollars
for whoever wins.

30:15.514 --> 30:17.416
Another hundred
if they break the record.

30:17.483 --> 30:20.953
Next contestant...
Two hundred dollars
for throwing a rock?

30:21.020 --> 30:23.990
- It's harder than it looks.
Come on, Dragon!

30:24.056 --> 30:27.093
Let's go!

30:27.159 --> 30:29.595
- Let's go, Dragon!

30:29.661 --> 30:32.631
- Try it, Dad.

30:32.698 --> 30:34.666
That is a lot of money.

30:34.733 --> 30:37.136
Six feet, six inches.

30:37.203 --> 30:38.437
Whoo!

30:40.172 --> 30:44.710
Next contestant...
John Lombardi.

30:44.776 --> 30:47.046
You mind watching him
for a little bit?

30:48.714 --> 30:50.216
Yeah, sure.

30:51.683 --> 30:52.952
What do you say, coach?

30:53.019 --> 30:54.921
Knock 'em dead, kid.

30:57.056 --> 30:59.025
Come on!

31:03.229 --> 31:06.232
Yeah, right there.
Just sign in.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.467
All right. Good luck.

31:10.102 --> 31:12.104
Ten feet, four inches!

31:12.171 --> 31:15.707
The next contestant...
Big Mike!

31:18.010 --> 31:19.611
Big Mike!
Mike, let's go!

31:21.180 --> 31:23.482
Come on, Mike.
You can get it.

31:38.030 --> 31:39.298
Oh, yeah! Go on!

31:39.365 --> 31:41.033
That's the one to beat.

31:41.100 --> 31:44.003
Thirteen feet, one inch.

31:46.438 --> 31:50.209
And our last contestant...
Joe Matthews.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.313
Don't hurt yourself, boy.

31:54.380 --> 31:56.548
What's he weigh?
A buck and a quarter?

32:03.522 --> 32:06.025
Guy's too skinny.
That rock weighs more than him.

32:12.098 --> 32:15.501
You got it!
Don't drop it on your toe!
Come on. Pick it up!

32:19.305 --> 32:21.140
Almost there.

32:34.586 --> 32:36.388
Holy Moly!

32:47.699 --> 32:51.803
Fifteen feet!
A new record!

33:03.149 --> 33:05.451
I must say I'm quite impressed.

33:05.517 --> 33:07.619
Thank you, Officer.

33:07.686 --> 33:10.656
Something tells me that
doesn't happen very often.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.891
When you say "officer,"
something tells me...

33:12.958 --> 33:16.395
I'm not the first cop
to ask you a lot
of inconvenient questions.

33:16.462 --> 33:19.965
Seriously?
Are you ever off duty?

33:20.032 --> 33:22.668
Are you ever gonna
honestly answer a question?

33:22.734 --> 33:24.736
What if I told you
there's nothing to know?

33:24.803 --> 33:27.739
I just need to be left alone
so I can figure some things out.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.843
As long as you're living
with my aunts,
it's not good enough.

33:31.910 --> 33:34.956
All right, look.
I just need to make enough money
so I can get my truck fixed...

33:34.980 --> 33:36.982
so me and my son
can get back on the road,

33:37.049 --> 33:39.185
and then I promise
you'll never see me again.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.854
How'd your wife die?
My mommy died.

33:42.921 --> 33:46.092
It's okay, buddy.
Are you going
to go away too?

33:46.158 --> 33:49.195
Are you going to die?
Don't you worry.
I'm not going anywhere.

33:49.261 --> 33:52.098
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Hey, he's burning up.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.500
Bobby?

33:55.567 --> 33:57.603
He's having a fever convulsion.

33:57.669 --> 34:00.549
We need to go to my car
and get his temp down.
Oh, my God! Bobby! Come on!

34:01.840 --> 34:03.642
I guess this'll be faster.

34:17.322 --> 34:20.792
I don't know, Chief.
He's still with the doctor.

34:20.859 --> 34:24.230
Well, I'd like
to stay around here,
make sure he's okay.

34:25.264 --> 34:28.266
Okay, thanks. I will.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.572
How's Bobby?
He'll be okay.

34:34.639 --> 34:37.609
Thank God.
Yeah. It's
what you said.

34:37.676 --> 34:40.978
It was fever, ear infection,
swollen throat, you know?

34:41.045 --> 34:43.915
I knew he was sick.
I don't know
what I was thinking.

34:43.982 --> 34:47.253
I should have brought him
in right away. I mean,
if you hadn't been there...

34:47.319 --> 34:50.422
Hey, he's gonna be okay.
That's all that matters.

34:51.723 --> 34:55.127
Thank you.
Thanks.

34:57.396 --> 35:00.566
I gotta stop by the pharmacist
and get a prescription.

35:00.632 --> 35:03.101
Uh, it's gonna cost me
180 bucks.

35:03.169 --> 35:05.171
That's your prize money.
Yeah.

35:05.237 --> 35:08.274
So my truck's gonna stay
a little bit longer.

35:09.675 --> 35:11.777
Listen, Joe...
No, no, no. I get it.

35:11.843 --> 35:13.888
You're doing your job.
You're looking out
for your family.

35:13.912 --> 35:16.648
And I would do
the same thing
if I was in your shoes.

35:16.715 --> 35:21.119
So can you do me a favor
and let me make sure
he's okay?

35:21.187 --> 35:23.121
And then we'll get
to all that stuff.

35:23.189 --> 35:26.592
Can we do that?
Yeah, we can do that.

35:30.128 --> 35:33.699
Joe, come. Come inside.

35:36.202 --> 35:37.469
How is the boy?

35:37.536 --> 35:40.739
The doctor put him
on antibiotics.
He'll be okay.

35:41.873 --> 35:42.874
What's all this?

35:42.941 --> 35:45.677
Bobby will stay here tonight.

35:46.612 --> 35:47.413
In the house?

35:47.479 --> 35:49.047
It's okay.
We'll stay in the cabin.

35:49.114 --> 35:53.452
Not in this weather.
The cabin's too cold.
He'll catch a chill.

35:53.519 --> 35:58.890
Bobby will sleep on the couch,
and Joe on the floor
next to him.

36:00.526 --> 36:02.861
They're right.
In case he needs them.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.299
Thank you.
No.

36:10.502 --> 36:13.038
All right.
I'm gonna sleep here
tonight, Joe.

36:13.104 --> 36:15.641
We'll have that talk
in the morning?

36:22.448 --> 36:26.518
Where is baseball's phenom
Micah Mattias hiding and why?

36:26.585 --> 36:28.663
Is he running from the murder
scene of his late wife,

36:28.687 --> 36:30.922
Hollywood starlet Grace Hunter?

36:41.933 --> 36:43.869
Please leave a message
after the tone.

36:43.935 --> 36:46.738
Our panel this evening
will discuss his motives,

36:46.805 --> 36:50.542
his alibi and his future
in major league baseball.

36:52.010 --> 36:53.945
Your friends worry.

36:56.948 --> 36:58.350
Is he okay?

36:59.351 --> 37:01.186
He woke up when I took
his temperature,

37:01.253 --> 37:03.422
but I rocked him back to sleep.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.958
I believe his fever has broke.

37:07.959 --> 37:09.261
Ah, you should've got me up.

37:12.197 --> 37:15.867
When I worked at the school,
I always had children
in my lap.

37:16.602 --> 37:19.237
I miss it.

37:24.676 --> 37:27.313
I wish I knew how to thank you
for everything you've done.

37:28.614 --> 37:31.483
The scripture says
to treat all strangers...

37:31.550 --> 37:34.286
as though they were angels.

37:36.021 --> 37:39.325
I'm no angel.
Far from it.

37:42.060 --> 37:46.164
Yet I think the more
you run from your troubles,

37:46.231 --> 37:48.033
the more lost you become.

37:51.069 --> 37:52.871
You're a wise woman, Bertha.

37:54.473 --> 37:58.877
I am an old woman,
but I have learned
some things.

38:02.781 --> 38:08.754
Now, we must decide
what is to become of you.

38:10.922 --> 38:14.225
Well, I think I should
get my truck fixed
and get out of your hair.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.894
Because of our Rachel?

38:17.062 --> 38:19.498
I just don't think I fit in
with her worldview.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.635
Do not judge her too harshly.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.772
She also has been through much.

38:27.939 --> 38:30.008
She lost her mother
when she was very young...

38:30.075 --> 38:31.743
and her father...

38:31.810 --> 38:32.878
The policeman?

38:37.048 --> 38:38.750
What happened to him?

38:46.525 --> 38:49.395
It's late.
Get some rest.

39:20.258 --> 39:21.960
You're up and at 'em.

39:22.027 --> 39:26.598
Yeah. Your aunts
had a list waiting for me
when I sat down to breakfast.

39:26.665 --> 39:28.867
They believe that hard work
is a blessing.

39:30.201 --> 39:33.705
To tell you the truth,
I'm starting to enjoy it
myself.

39:40.178 --> 39:41.880
Are we gonna have
our... talk?

39:41.947 --> 39:44.249
Why don't we just start
with the easy stuff?

39:44.315 --> 39:46.051
Like your shoes.

39:46.117 --> 39:47.686
You don't like my shoes?

39:48.754 --> 39:51.823
I like your shoes.
Couldn't buy your shoes.

39:53.324 --> 39:55.561
They cost $300.

39:55.627 --> 39:58.139
The rest of your outfit
looks like you've been living
on the streets.

39:58.163 --> 40:01.767
Your hair, your beard.
Makes me think that
you're in disguise.

40:03.234 --> 40:05.170
What are you hiding from, Joe?

40:05.236 --> 40:07.939
Just trying to give my son
a chance at a normal life.

40:08.006 --> 40:10.308
Last couple days,
that's normal to you?

40:10.375 --> 40:12.511
Compared to what
we've been through.

40:14.680 --> 40:19.551
Down in Texas? All right,
you're not from Texas.

40:19.618 --> 40:22.287
- All over.

40:22.353 --> 40:25.624
Joe, I'm a cop.
This is how it works. You
have to answer the questions.

40:25.691 --> 40:27.893
Why? Have I
committed a crime?
I don't know!

40:31.429 --> 40:32.664
How'd your wife die?

40:39.337 --> 40:40.806
My wife was murdered.

40:45.911 --> 40:49.314
I was away that night,
and someone came into
our home...

40:49.380 --> 40:51.650
and locked Bobby in his room.

40:53.284 --> 40:56.087
He was still in there
when I came back
the next morning.

40:57.556 --> 41:00.892
He couldn't understand
why his mom wouldn't
come when he called.

41:06.732 --> 41:08.099
Do you know who did it?

41:11.436 --> 41:13.972
The police
spent the first week
picking apart my alibi.

41:14.039 --> 41:18.644
When they couldn't,
they decided
that it was random,

41:18.710 --> 41:22.614
that it was a, uh,
robbery gone wrong.

41:25.116 --> 41:26.351
You don't believe 'em?

41:26.417 --> 41:28.620
She let them in...

41:29.955 --> 41:33.324
in the middle of the night.

41:33.391 --> 41:35.226
Why would she do that?

41:41.533 --> 41:43.268
Dad, where are you?

41:53.344 --> 41:55.847
Hey.
Dad. Hey, Dad.

41:55.914 --> 41:58.516
You look like you're
feeling better. Huh?

41:59.450 --> 42:02.220
You look good.

42:02.287 --> 42:05.891
Wow. I was worried
there.

42:07.392 --> 42:08.894
Boom, boink, boink,
boink, boink.

42:09.961 --> 42:11.963
You were asleep for a long time.

42:13.264 --> 42:14.633
Morning.
Good morning.

42:14.700 --> 42:16.434
Morning.
Hi.

42:16.501 --> 42:17.936
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

42:22.307 --> 42:23.742
Can I see this?

42:23.809 --> 42:26.612
I thought you said that stuff
turns your brain to mush?

42:28.914 --> 42:31.850
"Micah Mattias."
He's a baseball player?

42:31.917 --> 42:34.152
That's like saying
the Mona Lisa's a painting.

42:34.219 --> 42:37.288
Yeah.
Everybody used to call them
the new DiMaggios.

42:37.355 --> 42:39.858
Rachel, can I see you a minute?

42:39.925 --> 42:41.459
Yeah.

42:41.526 --> 42:45.063
Oh, I forgot.
We got the results for
those prints you sent in.

42:47.866 --> 42:49.534
So who's Joe Matthews?

42:49.601 --> 42:51.737
He's doing some work
for my aunts.

42:51.803 --> 42:54.640
And something in his demeanor
led you to believe...

42:54.706 --> 42:58.043
that he was a strange character?

42:59.277 --> 43:00.779
He seemed scruffy.

43:01.680 --> 43:04.683
He was scruffy?

43:04.750 --> 43:06.685
Do we have a match?

43:06.752 --> 43:10.922
No. He's not in our system.
He's never been arrested,

43:10.989 --> 43:13.558
never been in the military
or worked for the government.

43:13.625 --> 43:14.693
Well, that's good.

43:14.760 --> 43:17.062
No, Rachel, it's not good.

43:17.128 --> 43:19.297
You're dogging a man
who's done nothing illegal,

43:19.364 --> 43:21.667
who's doing the best he can
to take care of his son,

43:21.733 --> 43:24.636
who's even trying
to pay your aunts back
by working around the inn?

43:24.703 --> 43:28.106
- It's not like that.
- It is exactly like that.

43:30.408 --> 43:32.243
Rachel, you are a good cop.

43:32.310 --> 43:35.313
You keep at it,
you're gonna be as good
as your daddy.

43:35.380 --> 43:38.817
And Frank Troyler was
one of the best I ever had
the honor of serving with.

43:38.884 --> 43:41.352
- This isn't about him.
- No, it's not.

43:41.419 --> 43:44.690
It's about you and what
you have yet to learn...

43:44.756 --> 43:47.192
That Frank understood better
than anybody I know.

43:47.258 --> 43:48.994
What's that?

43:49.060 --> 43:51.697
That
there's more to this job
than a badge and a gun.

43:57.402 --> 43:58.402
Okay.

44:01.072 --> 44:04.710
And, Rachel?
Leave him alone.

44:15.854 --> 44:17.355
Ladies?

44:17.422 --> 44:19.891
We made it nice for you, Joe.

44:19.958 --> 44:22.694
Yeah, I can see that.
Thank you. But why?

44:22.761 --> 44:25.630
To make you and Bobby
feel at home.

44:25.697 --> 44:27.298
Oh. You've already done that.

44:28.734 --> 44:30.869
We have a business
proposition for you.

44:32.670 --> 44:35.040
We are offering you a job.

44:35.106 --> 44:36.607
A job?

44:36.674 --> 44:38.409
Mm-hmm. Helping us.

44:38.476 --> 44:41.579
There are many repairs
that must be done here.

44:41.646 --> 44:45.016
Our house needs to be painted,
and we can no longer
look after the yard.

44:45.083 --> 44:46.584
You will do these things for us.

44:46.651 --> 44:51.723
We cannot pay a lot,
but you could save enough
to repair your truck.

44:52.991 --> 44:55.393
After that,
it is in God's hands.

44:56.795 --> 44:57.996
I don't know what to say.

44:59.230 --> 45:00.298
Say yes.

45:00.365 --> 45:03.869
What do you think, Bobby?
I like it here.

45:03.935 --> 45:06.071
Me too. Looks like
we got a deal.

45:06.137 --> 45:09.775
- Yay! Bobby can stay.

45:11.309 --> 45:13.044
Hey, Sam, it's Rachel.

45:14.279 --> 45:15.947
Good. Yeah.

45:16.014 --> 45:18.716
Listen, do you still need
help this afternoon?

45:18.784 --> 45:20.485
I think I might have
found somebody.

45:44.810 --> 45:47.545
Nice ride.
Are you playing hooky?

45:47.612 --> 45:49.347
Kind of.

45:50.782 --> 45:52.818
I got to stop
calling you officer.

45:54.953 --> 45:56.187
How are you feeling, Bobby?

45:56.254 --> 45:59.224
Okay. We're going
to live here now.

46:00.691 --> 46:02.103
Yeah, I was gonna
tell you about that.

46:02.127 --> 46:04.495
Your aunts invited us
to stay on a while.

46:07.298 --> 46:11.369
Uh, I mean, they could use
the help, definitely.

46:12.904 --> 46:15.382
Listen, the reason
I came down is 'cause
I have to ask you favor.

46:15.406 --> 46:17.542
Sure.
Every year
at the festival...

46:17.608 --> 46:20.912
the fire department
plays the high school kids
in a baseball game.

46:20.979 --> 46:23.014
You know, for fun.
Uh-huh.

46:23.081 --> 46:27.018
Anyway, the department's
down a couple guys this year.
Do you play baseball?

46:27.919 --> 46:29.520
My dad is the best!

46:31.589 --> 46:33.058
He's a little biased.

46:33.124 --> 46:36.161
Look, everyone
would really appreciate it
if you played.

46:36.227 --> 46:39.364
Well, I told your aunts
I'd finish this fence today.

46:41.632 --> 46:43.811
I'm sure they'd be fine if you
took off for a couple hours.

46:43.835 --> 46:45.670
Do they have hot dogs?

46:45.736 --> 46:48.539
You bet they have
hot dogs. Yeah.

46:48.606 --> 46:51.242
Can we, Dad?
Please?

46:51.309 --> 46:53.912
You're just in this
for the hot dogs.

46:53.979 --> 46:56.347
- Knock 'em dead, kid.

46:56.414 --> 47:00.285
I'll have to borrow a glove.

47:00.351 --> 47:02.287
We can do that.

47:03.955 --> 47:07.158
Okay, everybody listen up.
This is Joe Matthews.

47:07.225 --> 47:11.362
Joe's filling in for Larry.
Uh, do you play much ball, Joe?

47:11.429 --> 47:13.531
Uh, it's been a while.

47:14.832 --> 47:16.834
Maybe we'll start you out
in right field.

47:16.902 --> 47:18.336
Oh, yeah.
That sounds good.

47:18.403 --> 47:20.805
All right. All right. Let's go.
Come on. Let's get out there.

47:20.872 --> 47:23.541
Let's go.
Let's show these hotshots
how the game is played.

47:28.880 --> 47:29.948
Hi.
Hi.

47:32.617 --> 47:34.953
So there's our mystery man.

47:35.020 --> 47:38.523
A little shaggy, but
definitely easy on the eyes.

47:38.589 --> 47:40.591
That's not the point.

47:40.658 --> 47:42.727
Like you haven't noticed.

47:42.793 --> 47:44.795
Okay.
"Okay."

47:44.862 --> 47:45.863
Play ball!

48:50.228 --> 48:52.630
All right, Joe, you're up.

48:53.965 --> 48:55.800
That's it. Come on.
Knock one out of the park.

48:55.866 --> 48:56.934
You can do it.
Come on.

48:57.002 --> 48:58.503
Batter up!

49:00.271 --> 49:01.973
Hey, Dad!

49:03.941 --> 49:05.143
Let's go, Joe.

49:10.381 --> 49:11.316
Batter up!

49:11.382 --> 49:13.518
Got two men on.
Bring 'em home.

49:21.959 --> 49:23.161
Strike one!

49:23.228 --> 49:26.264
- You can't hit!

49:26.331 --> 49:29.467
This is not good. No.
No, it isn't.

49:32.737 --> 49:34.072
You can do this.

49:34.139 --> 49:36.574
Two men on. Bring it in.

49:39.610 --> 49:41.079
Come on, Dad!

49:47.285 --> 49:48.386
Strike two!

49:48.453 --> 49:50.455
Okay, that's
even worse.
Right?

49:53.058 --> 49:55.026
Come on. Let's go.
Let's get a good swing.

50:00.731 --> 50:02.333
The next one's his.

50:03.834 --> 50:06.237
Come on. Let's go!

50:32.029 --> 50:35.966
- Told you!

50:36.033 --> 50:37.635
All right, Joe!

50:44.709 --> 50:46.244
Whoo!

50:48.079 --> 50:51.882
Come on. Yeah! Come on!

50:51.949 --> 50:54.085
You did it!

50:54.152 --> 50:56.721
You slaughtered back there.
That was awesome.

50:56.787 --> 50:58.523
That guy should be
in the major leagues.

50:58.589 --> 51:00.501
Did you hear about that guy
hitting that home run?

51:00.525 --> 51:03.728
Yeah, he launched it.
Even had room for error.

51:03.794 --> 51:05.930
By golly, that was a hit.

51:05.996 --> 51:07.498
Sure was.

51:07.565 --> 51:10.401
That guy should be
in the major leagues.

51:25.550 --> 51:29.387
You had to show off!
Couldn't leave it alone!

51:30.888 --> 51:32.690
Just had to be a show-off.

51:33.958 --> 51:36.494
Now what are you gonna do

51:36.561 --> 51:40.931
I just wanted to find
a place where my son
could be safe again.

51:40.998 --> 51:46.204
And now I can't stay,
and I can't leave
with a broken-down truck.

51:48.639 --> 51:50.208
I need some help.

51:56.447 --> 51:57.447
Hi.

52:00.351 --> 52:02.753
Hi.
That was quite a game.

52:04.289 --> 52:06.591
I guess you really are
as good as the magazines say.

52:08.893 --> 52:12.897
When did you figure out
who I really am?

52:15.266 --> 52:16.867
I'm still working on that.

52:19.170 --> 52:21.138
Who's Chloe?

52:21.206 --> 52:25.643
Chloe's my manager.
She, uh, handles my life.

52:25.710 --> 52:28.613
She lined up this gig.
It was a motivational
conference.

52:28.679 --> 52:30.759
I just had to show up,
sign some autographs,
you know.

52:30.815 --> 52:34.051
Money was unbelievable,
so I couldn't pass it up.

52:34.118 --> 52:36.020
So the police knew
you were out of town?

52:36.086 --> 52:38.356
Yeah. I had
10,000 witnesses.

52:38.423 --> 52:40.225
Well, then why question you?

52:40.291 --> 52:42.593
'Cause they didn't know
what else to do.

52:42.660 --> 52:45.496
They had no leads, no clues.

52:45.563 --> 52:47.898
They kept coming back
at how Grace had opened
the door...

52:47.965 --> 52:50.401
and how the killer
had locked Bobby
in his room.

52:50.468 --> 52:52.237
Right. It was somebody
that she had to know,

52:52.303 --> 52:53.663
somebody that knew
Bobby was there.

52:53.704 --> 52:55.806
Yeah, they kept trying
to dig up dirt, you know,

52:55.873 --> 52:58.609
like Grace was having an affair
and she let the guy in.

53:00.711 --> 53:01.711
Was she?

53:03.648 --> 53:05.650
No. I mean,
not that I know of.

53:05.716 --> 53:08.686
It's not like things
were great between us though.

53:08.753 --> 53:13.224
What do you mean?
I loved Grace.

53:15.125 --> 53:17.562
But she was a movie star,
and she always put
her career first.

53:17.628 --> 53:19.730
And I knew that
when I married her.

53:19.797 --> 53:22.933
I just didn't think
that we'd grow apart
the way we did.

53:25.202 --> 53:28.973
We kept up a good front,
but it was just a matter
of time.

53:29.039 --> 53:31.542
I'm sorry.

53:34.979 --> 53:38.983
You had to have known
how that would look though,
leaving town like that.

53:40.418 --> 53:43.821
The tabloids camped out
at my house.

53:45.390 --> 53:48.293
We were prisoners
in our own home.

53:49.927 --> 53:53.130
Poor Bobby.
I'd had enough.
My son had had enough.

53:53.197 --> 53:56.634
I just wanted to get
as far away from there
as I could.

53:56.701 --> 54:00.471
Don't you have any family,
somewhere you could stay?

54:02.039 --> 54:07.945
I have a brother, Dylan,
who only comes around
when he wants money.

54:12.550 --> 54:15.686
You should've told me
who you were...
right away.

54:15.753 --> 54:20.325
I would've had to trust you.
That's one thing I was running
pretty low on when I got here.

54:20.391 --> 54:22.360
But I was supposed to trust you?

54:22.427 --> 54:25.996
I know. That's... I'm sorry.
That wasn't fair.

54:27.465 --> 54:29.209
It just never occurred to me
that I'd find a place...

54:29.233 --> 54:31.502
where I'd feel safe again,

54:31.569 --> 54:33.371
where my son could just be
a regular kid...

54:33.438 --> 54:37.642
and start to... mend.

54:39.544 --> 54:40.911
So what happens now?

54:40.978 --> 54:43.013
Well, that depends on you.

54:44.415 --> 54:46.216
Are you asking
if you can trust me?

54:46.283 --> 54:48.919
People would pay a lot of money
to know where I am right now.

54:50.621 --> 54:52.056
They're not gonna
find out from me.

54:53.824 --> 54:55.025
Thank you.

54:57.161 --> 54:59.397
- Micah.

54:59.464 --> 55:01.632
Do you mind
if I call you Joe?
I'm used to Joe.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.068
Me too.

55:05.503 --> 55:08.373
All right. All right, Joe.
No more baseball for you.

55:10.341 --> 55:11.576
You're too competitive.

55:11.642 --> 55:16.013
Right. Right. I know.
What's my problem?

55:34.599 --> 55:37.668
Morning,
sleepyhead.
What's that?

55:37.735 --> 55:39.604
I think it's church bells.

55:39.670 --> 55:41.806
Are we going to church?

55:42.707 --> 55:43.608
Whoo-hoo!

55:43.674 --> 55:47.712
Bertha says you must
come in to breakfast.

55:47.778 --> 55:52.249
Hurry in. And then
you must hitch up Nelly...

55:52.316 --> 55:54.519
so you're not late.

55:55.386 --> 55:56.454
Late for what?

55:57.655 --> 55:59.289
Don't you hear the bells?

56:05.430 --> 56:06.697
I guess we're going to church.

56:08.466 --> 56:09.600
Who's Nelly?

56:09.667 --> 56:12.202
Here, horsey.

56:12.269 --> 56:14.605
Whoa. Hold on, horsey.

56:14.672 --> 56:16.340
Here, horsey.
Here. Here.

56:18.008 --> 56:20.377
Ah, come on, Nelly.
You're making me look bad.

56:20.445 --> 56:23.548
Looks like you're playing tag.

56:23.614 --> 56:27.051
Yeah

56:27.117 --> 56:29.119
Nope. Aunt Bertha says
if you're gonna stay on,

56:29.186 --> 56:31.722
you gotta learn how to drive
the horse and buggy.

56:32.457 --> 56:34.492
- Come on.

56:34.559 --> 56:37.762
- I do not mind walking.

56:37.828 --> 56:40.465
- Stop playing around.

56:40.531 --> 56:42.500
You must go.
You will be late.

56:43.701 --> 56:47.304
Okay. Okay.
Like so.

56:47.371 --> 56:49.339
Like so.
Joe, you
put on the bridle.

56:49.406 --> 56:52.477
Rachel, show him
how to hitch the buggy.

56:53.343 --> 56:55.112
Come on, cowboy.

56:59.083 --> 57:00.083
Thanks.

57:45.796 --> 57:49.033
Your aunts outdid
themselves... again.

57:49.099 --> 57:52.069
"Be not forgetful
to entertain strangers,

57:52.136 --> 57:56.140
for thereby some
have entertained angels
unawares."

57:56.206 --> 57:58.643
They really believe that?

57:58.709 --> 58:00.978
Yep, with all their heart.

58:03.914 --> 58:06.617
Me? I'm not so good
with strangers,

58:06.684 --> 58:10.220
and I've never met
an angel unawares.

58:11.488 --> 58:13.323
That seems to come
with the territory...

58:13.390 --> 58:15.125
of being a cop, right?

58:16.627 --> 58:18.829
It happened long
before I joined the force.

58:19.597 --> 58:21.532
What

58:28.606 --> 58:31.308
- Yeah, I do.

58:31.375 --> 58:33.578
I want to trust you.

58:35.580 --> 58:38.883
Well, I never met
an angel either.

58:38.949 --> 58:41.952
Sometimes you have to take
a chance with a regular person.

58:46.390 --> 58:47.825
It was my 10th birthday.

58:52.563 --> 58:54.865
The aunts, they always
made me a cake,

58:54.932 --> 58:57.835
so Dad and I were up to the inn.

58:57.902 --> 58:59.870
First he had to stop
at the bank.

59:02.840 --> 59:06.711
There was a man...
robbing the place.

59:09.146 --> 59:13.818
My dad was in uniform,
and he yelled out...

59:13.884 --> 59:15.653
Police!
Put down the gun!

59:19.556 --> 59:23.794
The guy shot him, killed him.

59:24.762 --> 59:27.998
Daddy, come back.
Come back, Daddy.

59:28.065 --> 59:31.769
Daddy, come back.
Come back!

59:33.437 --> 59:34.605
Wow.

59:36.540 --> 59:38.508
Everyone was running
around, screaming.

59:38.575 --> 59:42.212
- Everybody get down!

59:42.279 --> 59:46.316
My dad was just
laying there on the ground.
I grabbed his gun...

59:48.352 --> 59:50.054
and pointed it at the guy.

59:52.757 --> 59:55.926
I wanted to shoot him
so bad, and I couldn't.

01:00:04.268 --> 01:00:06.103
Come, mein Schatz.

01:00:29.526 --> 01:00:32.897
I'm still so scared
somebody's gonna take
something from me.

01:00:34.531 --> 01:00:36.233
Something that I love.

01:00:37.835 --> 01:00:39.704
Just can't trust anybody.

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:48.879
Well, I promise you...

01:00:48.946 --> 01:00:52.082
nobody understands
that fear more than I do.

01:01:04.028 --> 01:01:06.430
This was my mommy's favorite.

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:12.569
Thank you.
That's very sweet.

01:01:12.636 --> 01:01:15.005
Do you want to go
throw rocks with me?

01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:20.377
Yes, I would love to.

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:24.782
Let's go. Coming?

01:01:27.117 --> 01:01:30.120
Now I can't find...
Ooh, here's a rock.

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:38.896
He's asleep.

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:41.531
Big day.

01:01:41.598 --> 01:01:44.001
Best day ever.
That's a direct quote.

01:01:44.068 --> 01:01:48.739
Wow. I'm gonna sleep
at my place tonight.

01:01:48.806 --> 01:01:51.075
I know the aunts are good, so...

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:09.159
Good night.

01:02:11.595 --> 01:02:12.930
Good night.

01:03:02.712 --> 01:03:04.481
There he is! There he is!

01:03:04.548 --> 01:03:07.717
- Micah! Micah! Over there!

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:09.920
Over here. Over here.
Micah. Micah.

01:03:09.987 --> 01:03:11.788
Is it true that Grace
was having an affair?

01:03:11.856 --> 01:03:13.090
What are you trying to hide?

01:03:13.157 --> 01:03:14.491
On her insurance policy?

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.804
Don't you think you owe
your fans an explanation?

01:03:17.828 --> 01:03:21.065
Do you plan to play next season?
Why are you here in Sugarcreek?

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:22.967
Are you seeking protection
from somebody?

01:03:23.033 --> 01:03:27.604
How do you think the team
will do this season? Who's
looking out for your son? Micah!

01:03:44.354 --> 01:03:46.523
How could you do this, Rachel?

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:49.593
I trusted you, Rachel.
How could you do this to Bobby?

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:51.328
Joe, what's wrong?

01:03:51.395 --> 01:03:54.298
I just hope you held out
for the highest bidder.

01:03:59.803 --> 01:04:00.905
Joe?

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:24.761
In fact, he's been
hiding in this house.

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:33.303
Who's this?
Let's ask her what's going on.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:34.838
Let's go over there.
Come here.

01:04:34.905 --> 01:04:37.425
We want some answers.
What's your name, miss?
Ma'am, who are you?

01:04:37.474 --> 01:04:40.310
Where are you going?
You guys, go.

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:43.147
Are we leaving?
I'm afraid so.

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:48.986
Is he okay?

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:51.388
I didn't do this.

01:04:51.455 --> 01:04:54.058
Then who did it?
You're the only one I told.

01:04:54.124 --> 01:04:58.262
I don't know. It wasn't me.
I didn't tell anybody.

01:04:58.328 --> 01:04:59.396
What?

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:03.809
We have to get
you guys out of here,
away from these people.

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:05.369
I don't want your help.

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:10.074
Joe. Believe me.
Please.

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:12.342
It's Micah.
Micah Mattias.

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:14.979
Just ask any one
of these people out here.

01:05:23.287 --> 01:05:26.590
Again you are having
trouble, Joe Matthews.

01:05:34.298 --> 01:05:36.333
Mr. Mattias will be
making a statement shortly.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:39.069
In the meantime, he asks
that you please...

01:05:39.136 --> 01:05:41.105
respect the privacy
of these Amish people...

01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:43.507
who have taken him
into their hearts.

01:05:43.573 --> 01:05:44.674
That's all.

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:54.718
We've just been told
Micah Mattias is inside
the house right now,

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:57.321
and we've been assured that
despite his reluctance...

01:05:57.387 --> 01:06:00.190
Eek off the cameras.
Flee ya in a half a schtickle.

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:02.458
What'd he say?

01:06:05.729 --> 01:06:08.698
**

01:06:21.445 --> 01:06:22.746
Charming.

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:31.321
Do you mind?

01:06:32.722 --> 01:06:35.925
And I will say a silent prayer
that no tourists pass by.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.095
Hey, Chloe.

01:06:38.162 --> 01:06:40.197
What

01:06:47.704 --> 01:06:49.073
Hi, Chloe.

01:06:49.873 --> 01:06:53.477
Micah?
Oh, Micah.

01:06:55.379 --> 01:06:57.181
They put me in a train.

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:03.487
A famous baseball player?

01:07:05.122 --> 01:07:07.324
How did he come
to be at our door?

01:07:07.391 --> 01:07:10.060
Everything else
he said was true.

01:07:10.127 --> 01:07:12.129
He just needed
to get away from all that.

01:07:12.196 --> 01:07:14.598
Is Bobby gone?

01:07:15.799 --> 01:07:16.799
I'm afraid so.

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:20.770
They really didn't
waste any time...

01:07:20.837 --> 01:07:24.508
once word got out
that Micah Mattias
was in our little town.

01:07:35.819 --> 01:07:37.654
Rachel, I didn't mean to...

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:40.490
Mm-hmm. All those
magazines you read.

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:42.626
I'm really surprised
it took you that long.

01:07:42.692 --> 01:07:45.129
What'd you do,
put a word out
to the reporters?

01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:47.231
I'd never do that.
Well, how'd
they find out?

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:54.338
Facebook.
But I told everyone
it was a secret...

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:56.005
that no one else could know.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:57.383
How many friends
do you have on Facebook?

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:58.927
How many friends
do those friends have?

01:08:00.144 --> 01:08:01.945
I'm so sorry, Rachel.

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:05.115
Forget it.
It doesn't matter
anymore.

01:08:06.183 --> 01:08:07.551
He's gone.

01:08:09.018 --> 01:08:10.620
Facebook?

01:08:10.687 --> 01:08:14.758
Something about a baseball game
in Sugarcreek, Ohio.

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:18.395
Friend of mine saw it,
called me, and here I am
to the rescue.

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:21.165
So it wasn't her.

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:23.676
Wasn't who?
What are you talking about?

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:28.438
Rachel. She's, um...
She's a friend.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.442
Micah, what's been
going on with you?

01:08:32.509 --> 01:08:35.179
Where's Bobby, and why
are you dressed like that?

01:08:35.245 --> 01:08:38.014
Bobby's with Eli,
who's another friend.

01:08:38.081 --> 01:08:40.884
And dressing like this
was the only way to get
past the reporters.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:43.487
Well, don't worry.
We'll get you all cleaned up.

01:08:43.553 --> 01:08:46.290
Luckily I brought you
some real clothes.

01:08:46.356 --> 01:08:50.260
And I'll handle the press...
and you...

01:08:50.327 --> 01:08:51.861
like I always do.

01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:55.741
I don't care about that.
I just want to get back
to the house.

01:08:55.765 --> 01:09:01.337
Oh, of course.
But first there's something
that I need to tell you.

01:09:01.404 --> 01:09:04.474
It's about Dylan.
What about him?

01:09:06.343 --> 01:09:10.747
Would Grace have let your
brother into the house that
night if you weren't there?

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.627
This is Rachel.

01:09:50.086 --> 01:09:53.523
If there's one thing
in the world
I'm absolutely sure of,

01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:55.659
you don't have
a Facebook account.

01:09:56.826 --> 01:09:59.128
You're right.
It was Kim.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.398
I never should have doubted you.

01:10:01.465 --> 01:10:03.500
How'd you figure it out?

01:10:04.834 --> 01:10:06.403
Hi. I'm Chloe.

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:08.438
Hi.

01:10:08.505 --> 01:10:12.108
Rachel Troyler, Chloe Styles,
my business manager.

01:10:12.175 --> 01:10:15.645
Thank you for taking
such good care
of Micah and Bobby.

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:19.483
Yeah, well, you know,
they've started to fit
right in around here.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:22.552
Hmm, I can see that.

01:10:22.619 --> 01:10:24.564
We'll have to get him back
on the first plane to L.A....

01:10:24.588 --> 01:10:26.556
so we can get him
all cleaned up again.

01:10:26.623 --> 01:10:28.992
Right.
How are your aunts
holding up?

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:34.898
Well, I think Aunt Lydia
is winning them all over
with her cookies.

01:10:34.964 --> 01:10:36.766
Right.
How do they do it?

01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:40.236
I mean, these people
come in, uninvited, make
a total nuisance of themselves,

01:10:40.304 --> 01:10:42.906
and your aunts welcome them
with open arms.

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:46.476
They're used to it, you know.
People have made fun of their
clothes forever,

01:10:46.543 --> 01:10:48.645
taken pictures without asking.

01:10:48.712 --> 01:10:52.181
They decided a long time ago
it was easier to be
who they are...

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:54.551
than pretend to be
something they're not.

01:10:58.187 --> 01:11:02.326
Well, don't you worry,
Micah. I will take care
of this. If this is my...

01:11:02.392 --> 01:11:04.494
No. Rachel's right.

01:11:04.561 --> 01:11:07.731
- No more hiding.

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:31.721
- Whoa.

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:36.693
All right, listen up.
I know you got
a lot of questions.

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:39.262
I'm gonna try to answer
them the best I can.

01:11:39.329 --> 01:11:42.466
But maybe we should just
get a little comfortable.
It's gonna take a while.

01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:47.070
Hey, Lydia, I don't suppose
you could spare a slice
of that apple pie?

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:51.575
Joe.

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:54.744
I will be right back.

01:11:58.815 --> 01:12:01.551
After that, we drove
through the Midwest
for a while.

01:12:01.618 --> 01:12:03.853
Beautiful country.
Oh, we went to...

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:07.323
We found a barbecue place
in Oklahoma City.

01:12:07.391 --> 01:12:10.894
I don't know what they do
to that barbecue sauce,

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:16.533
- but it is... mmm, mmm, good.
- Oh, okay.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:21.371
And Missouri...
You ever been to a small town
in Missouri called Macks Creek?

01:12:21.438 --> 01:12:23.507
Macks Count...

01:12:24.908 --> 01:12:27.076
I'm out of here.
What a waste
of time.

01:12:29.245 --> 01:12:32.549
If he keeps this up
much longer, they're all
gonna lose interest.

01:12:33.517 --> 01:12:36.486
You're right.

01:12:36.553 --> 01:12:38.221
But they do have
good bird-watching.

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:40.123
I'm not much
of a bird-watcher,

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:43.827
but there was this one moment
where I thought I saw
a purple martin.

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:46.830
I drove 10 hours for this.
They say that
one purple martin...

01:12:46.896 --> 01:12:50.266
eats about 12 mosquitoes
a night.

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:54.904
There's a huge clock
with a Swiss boy.

01:12:54.971 --> 01:12:59.142
There's a band, and
the instruments in the band...

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:00.544
are a trumpet...

01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:01.711
All right. Thank you.

01:13:01.778 --> 01:13:06.783
A fiddle. Wait a minute.
A cello, a bass cello...

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:09.352
All right, Chris.
Take care of yourself, man.

01:13:09.419 --> 01:13:11.855
That was a whole
bunch of nothing.
Good luck in Toronto.

01:13:16.493 --> 01:13:17.861
What do you think?

01:13:17.927 --> 01:13:21.097
Uh, I think
if there was a place
in the Hall of Fame...

01:13:21.164 --> 01:13:24.668
for the dullest player ever,
you'd be a lock.

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:27.203
Thank you.
My work here is done.

01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:30.974
Bobby called. Eli's sow
is about to deliver,

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.209
so he wants to spend
the night tonight.

01:13:33.276 --> 01:13:38.114
Oh, yeah.
Be the first night he's been
away from me in a long time.

01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:46.055
Well, it took some doing,
but I got you a room
at the motel.

01:13:47.524 --> 01:13:49.158
Oh, I'm fine here.

01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:52.762
Whatever you say.

01:13:52.829 --> 01:13:55.932
Rachel, would it be okay
if I followed you into town?

01:13:55.999 --> 01:14:00.169
It's starting to get dark.
I'm afraid I'll get lost.

01:14:00.236 --> 01:14:03.272
Sure.
I will see you tomorrow.

01:14:03.339 --> 01:14:04.908
Okay.
Okay.

01:14:50.053 --> 01:14:53.823
Hey, whatever questions
you've got, it can wait
till tomorrow, all right?

01:14:55.291 --> 01:14:56.693
Hello, Micah.

01:14:57.561 --> 01:14:58.628
Dylan.

01:14:58.695 --> 01:15:00.764
You're a hard man
to find these days.

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:03.399
I was thinking
maybe we should talk.

01:15:03.466 --> 01:15:04.834
Were you there?

01:15:05.969 --> 01:15:08.104
Can we just go inside?
I can explain.

01:15:09.172 --> 01:15:10.974
Just answer the question.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:14.644
Were you in L.A. that night
Grace got murdered?

01:15:16.479 --> 01:15:17.581
I was there...

01:15:17.647 --> 01:15:19.207
but only 'cause
I had a business deal...

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:20.717
I wanted to talk to you about.

01:15:20.784 --> 01:15:23.519
What did you do It wasn't me.

01:15:23.587 --> 01:15:26.455
I swear to God, Micah.
I would never hurt Grace.

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:29.292
Then why didn't you go
to the police, huh?
And say what?

01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:33.062
That your pathetic brother
was there that night,
but he didn't do it?

01:15:33.129 --> 01:15:36.065
Why would they believe me?
You don't even believe me.

01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:38.868
My son was locked
in his room all night,
crying for his mother.

01:15:38.935 --> 01:15:41.871
The house was dark.
I rang the bell.
I didn't hear anything.

01:15:41.938 --> 01:15:43.178
I thought you had all gone out.

01:15:43.239 --> 01:15:45.074
I didn't even find out
about the murder...

01:15:45.141 --> 01:15:47.310
till I saw it on the news
the next day.

01:15:57.754 --> 01:15:59.989
Grace was always kind
to me, Micah,

01:16:01.124 --> 01:16:02.892
even though I know
she didn't like me.

01:16:04.193 --> 01:16:06.763
She was a good person.
She didn't deserve that.

01:16:08.732 --> 01:16:11.034
Just go.
Just get out of here.

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:13.469
I know you don't think
much of me,

01:16:13.536 --> 01:16:15.972
and I don't blame you for it.

01:16:16.039 --> 01:16:19.242
But I would never
hurt your family.
You need to believe me.

01:16:23.747 --> 01:16:25.782
That's all I wanted to say.

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:27.817
Don't worry.

01:16:27.884 --> 01:16:30.954
I won't be coming around
asking for money anymore.

01:16:48.204 --> 01:16:49.773
Hello.

01:16:49.839 --> 01:16:51.140
You're next.

01:16:51.207 --> 01:16:53.777
Stay away from him.

01:16:54.911 --> 01:16:56.612
Who is this?

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.881
Hello?

01:17:24.407 --> 01:17:27.043
Hey, look who I found.

01:17:30.814 --> 01:17:33.182
It's gone.
Guess what, Dad?

01:17:33.249 --> 01:17:36.452
What?
Eli's sow
has neun babies.

01:17:36.519 --> 01:17:39.088
That's how you say nine
in German.

01:17:39.155 --> 01:17:43.026
Oh, ho. No kidding?
Thanks for bringing him home.

01:17:44.627 --> 01:17:46.262
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:17:49.966 --> 01:17:51.701
You didn't recognize the voice?

01:17:51.768 --> 01:17:53.903
Mm-mm. They were using
some sort of a filter.

01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:56.740
"You're next."
They were talking
about Grace.

01:17:57.974 --> 01:17:59.909
Which means that was
her killer on the phone.

01:18:02.145 --> 01:18:04.213
My brother came
to see me last night.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.783
What
To tell me that
he was in Los Angeles...

01:18:06.850 --> 01:18:09.085
the night that Grace was killed.

01:18:09.152 --> 01:18:13.256
L.A.P.D. know that?
But he swore
he didn't do it.

01:18:13.322 --> 01:18:16.059
That's a strange
coincidence though.

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:18.728
He shows up the same night
I get a threatening phone call?

01:18:18.795 --> 01:18:20.930
Why would Dylan threaten you?

01:18:22.398 --> 01:18:25.601
I don't know.
I gotta get to the station.

01:18:25.668 --> 01:18:28.304
Call me if you hear from him?

01:18:28.371 --> 01:18:29.371
Rachel?

01:18:30.306 --> 01:18:32.809
- Be careful.

01:18:33.877 --> 01:18:35.477
Keep an eye on things
around here for me.

01:18:53.797 --> 01:18:57.834
Didn't you get my message?
I said I'd take you
out to lunch.

01:18:58.835 --> 01:19:00.837
I don't really check
messages anymore.

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:03.206
But if you're hungry,

01:19:03.272 --> 01:19:06.209
Lydia makes enough food
to feed an army.

01:19:08.144 --> 01:19:09.144
Micah,

01:19:10.679 --> 01:19:15.318
I can't begin to know
what you've been through
these past few months.

01:19:15.384 --> 01:19:20.256
Maybe in some way
this whole road trip thing
was a good idea,

01:19:20.323 --> 01:19:24.027
but I think it's time
for you to come home now.

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:25.929
I've been thinking
about that too.

01:19:25.995 --> 01:19:28.764
Oh, I'm so glad to hear that...

01:19:28.832 --> 01:19:31.600
because I care
about you both so much,

01:19:31.667 --> 01:19:34.170
and it's really for the best.

01:19:34.237 --> 01:19:39.175
I've been thinking about it,
and we're not ready
to come home yet.

01:19:39.242 --> 01:19:42.545
Spring training starts soon.

01:19:43.847 --> 01:19:45.281
Spring training.

01:19:48.084 --> 01:19:51.387
Wow, baseball's the farthest
thing from my mind right now.

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:54.690
You can't really be willing
to throw your whole career
away for thi...

01:19:54.757 --> 01:19:58.727
Joe! I got you
some more water.

01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:00.529
- Thank you.

01:20:00.596 --> 01:20:04.868
We're talking here.
Do you understand?

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:08.471
Ah. Why is she
talking like that?

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:13.309
Thank you, Anna.

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:27.456
Don't talk to her
like that again.

01:20:27.523 --> 01:20:30.927
Well, I'm sorry, Micah,
but I have to think
about your career.

01:20:30.994 --> 01:20:33.129
I got work to do.

01:20:33.196 --> 01:20:34.196
Micah?

01:20:39.102 --> 01:20:43.072
Okay. Yeah, I will.
All right. Thanks.

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:47.276
L.A.P.D. found no prints or
any other forensic evidence...

01:20:47.343 --> 01:20:49.778
connecting Dylan Mattias
to the scene.

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:52.281
Which doesn't make him innocent.

01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:54.683
Okay. Thank you.

01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:56.852
The phone company
says that the call
to your house...

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.922
came from one of those
disposable cell phones.

01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:03.292
We can't trace that.

01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:07.396
What they do know
is that it was purchased
in L.A. County.

01:21:07.463 --> 01:21:11.534
All right. All right.
Let's get a description of
this guy out to our people.

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.503
Send it to the
sheriff's department as well.
I want to get them involved.

01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:16.872
I want them to know
what's going on, okay?
Okay.

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:18.942
All right.
Thank you.

01:21:29.986 --> 01:21:32.989
What's that?

01:21:35.191 --> 01:21:40.363
You stay here, buddy.

01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:52.108
Fire!

01:21:52.175 --> 01:21:57.113
Anna! Anna's upstairs, Joe.
Help her. Anna!

01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:00.984
- All the smoke!
- Anna, come out!

01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:03.786
- I can't get out!
- Be careful, Joe.

01:22:06.555 --> 01:22:09.993
Joe is coming! Anna?

01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:14.163
Anna! Anna! Anna!

01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:17.100
Open the door!
There's no handle
on this side!

01:22:17.166 --> 01:22:20.569
- Oh!
- Just open the doorknob.
Twist it open.

01:22:22.871 --> 01:22:25.508
- Anna!

01:22:25.574 --> 01:22:28.677
Get away. Get away
from the door for a second.

01:22:28.744 --> 01:22:31.680
- Anna!

01:22:31.747 --> 01:22:36.085
Come on. Come on, come on.
Come on. I got you. I got you.

01:22:36.152 --> 01:22:40.556
- Oh.
- Bobby's down there
waiting for you, okay?

01:22:42.425 --> 01:22:47.430
Joe! Joe! Joe, Bertha.
Bedroom's downstairs.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.935
- Oh!

01:22:56.439 --> 01:22:59.175
Aunt Bertha,
is everybody all right?
Is everybody out?

01:22:59.242 --> 01:23:01.310
I don't know.
Joe?

01:23:01.377 --> 01:23:03.146
Joe?
Bertha!

01:23:03.212 --> 01:23:05.348
Joe? She's out.
She's right there.
Hi. Huh?

01:23:08.417 --> 01:23:11.387
Anna. Anna.
Oh, I'm so glad.
Oh, sister.

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:16.059
You'll be safe.
It burned down.

01:23:17.526 --> 01:23:19.262
Are you okay?

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:22.698
Bertha. Oh, Rachel.
Come on. Come on, guys.

01:23:22.765 --> 01:23:25.501
It's okay. You're okay.
You saved me.

01:23:25.568 --> 01:23:30.306
The house burn down.
Rachel.

01:23:30.373 --> 01:23:32.341
House burning.
It's all right.

01:23:59.202 --> 01:24:01.970
Irv, go to overhaul.

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:04.540
Miller, check for extension.

01:24:08.911 --> 01:24:10.646
They found a gas can
in the yard.

01:24:10.713 --> 01:24:14.350
The state fire marshal's
on his way. He's gonna
have to make it official.

01:24:14.417 --> 01:24:16.685
Are you saying this is arson?

01:24:20.089 --> 01:24:24.393
You wouldn't know anybody
who might want to do
these ladies harm, do you?

01:24:50.486 --> 01:24:53.956
Well, at least
we will no longer need
to paint the house.

01:24:54.022 --> 01:24:55.824
I'm so sorry.

01:24:57.693 --> 01:24:59.195
God will provide.

01:25:06.635 --> 01:25:09.705
I'm going to take them
to Eli's... till we
figure out what to do.

01:25:09.772 --> 01:25:12.208
Okay, I have to stay here
and answer some questions.

01:25:16.812 --> 01:25:17.812
I'll see you soon.

01:25:22.418 --> 01:25:25.188
Joe came for us.

01:25:25.254 --> 01:25:27.690
I'm so sorry I wasn't
there for you.

01:25:27.756 --> 01:25:31.360
We need to stop
and get something before
we go to Uncle Eli's.

01:25:42.571 --> 01:25:46.209
I just love small towns.
Nobody locks their door.

01:25:46.275 --> 01:25:48.143
Not even the police.

01:25:48.211 --> 01:25:50.879
- I have been dying to ask you
something since I got here,

01:25:50.946 --> 01:25:55.218
and with everyone busy
with the fire, it seemed
like the perfect time.

01:25:56.285 --> 01:25:57.720
How did you know about the fire?

01:25:57.786 --> 01:26:02.858
Are you and Micah...
How should I put this?
An item?

01:26:02.925 --> 01:26:04.560
What?

01:26:04.627 --> 01:26:09.732
I know him so well,
and I can tell
he really likes you.

01:26:09.798 --> 01:26:12.901
And I've seen those little
looks between you.

01:26:12.968 --> 01:26:16.372
Something tells me you're
attracted to him too, right?

01:26:16.439 --> 01:26:19.575
All right, I think you
better leave before...
Before what?

01:26:19.642 --> 01:26:22.242
You don't really think
you can get that gun out
before I shoot you.

01:26:22.278 --> 01:26:25.814
Do you, Rachel?
And I will shoot you.

01:26:27.216 --> 01:26:28.984
You killed Grace.

01:26:29.051 --> 01:26:32.154
She didn't deserve him...

01:26:32.221 --> 01:26:33.822
and neither do you.

01:26:36.425 --> 01:26:39.628
Hey, Joe. Joe, somebody
wants to talk to you.

01:26:40.996 --> 01:26:43.366
Sheriff's deputies
found him in a motel
in the next town.

01:26:43.432 --> 01:26:46.435
Just so you know,
he was there all night, so he
couldn't have set the fire.

01:26:47.736 --> 01:26:50.205
You really thought I was
capable of something like this?

01:26:50.273 --> 01:26:52.741
What was I supposed
to believe? You show up.

01:26:52.808 --> 01:26:56.245
Next thing I know, Rachel
gets a threatening phone call,
the inn burns down.

01:26:56.312 --> 01:26:59.181
Chloe was right.
I can't trust you.
Chloe?

01:26:59.248 --> 01:27:02.585
Yeah. How did you think
I knew that you were in L.A.
the night Grace was killed?

01:27:02.651 --> 01:27:05.187
Micah, the only thing
I talk to Chloe about
was money.

01:27:05.254 --> 01:27:08.724
I never said anything to her
about being at your house
that night.

01:27:10.158 --> 01:27:11.427
Well, then how'd she know?

01:27:15.197 --> 01:27:17.333
Come on. Come on!

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.402
Guys, let's go.

01:27:19.468 --> 01:27:21.904
You left Bobby all alone
in that room.

01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:26.442
He was never alone.
I waited in the dark
until Micah came home.

01:27:28.344 --> 01:27:29.945
That's how you knew
Dylan was there?

01:27:30.012 --> 01:27:31.314
You were there waiting.

01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:36.218
How do you think it felt
for me, listening to Bobby
cry like that?

01:27:36.285 --> 01:27:39.955
But he had to stay in his room.
I couldn't let him
see his mother.

01:27:41.290 --> 01:27:44.427
You think that you can
just... replace her?

01:27:46.061 --> 01:27:50.699
Once Micah and I are married,
I'll be a better mother
than she ever was.

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:52.768
Why'd you burn down the inn?

01:27:52.835 --> 01:27:56.705
He was getting too attached
to this place.

01:27:56.772 --> 01:27:59.342
He has to come home with me.

01:28:00.543 --> 01:28:03.011
Rachel, Bertha wants to know
what's taking so long.

01:28:25.868 --> 01:28:27.336
Rachel.

01:28:29.805 --> 01:28:32.508
You no going nowhere.
Sit, Anna, sit.

01:28:35.544 --> 01:28:38.647
Do you understand?

01:28:41.116 --> 01:28:42.116
Rachel?

01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:45.454
All right, ladies.
We got it. We got it.

01:28:45.521 --> 01:28:47.656
Are you okay?
I'm fine. Fine.

01:28:47.723 --> 01:28:49.625
It was Chloe.
She killed Grace.
I know.

01:28:49.692 --> 01:28:51.660
Anna, we're good.
Okay.

01:28:51.727 --> 01:28:54.563
All right, calm down, miss.
Calm down. You're under arrest.

01:28:54.630 --> 01:28:56.950
Roll over on your stomach.
Put your hands behind your back.

01:28:58.834 --> 01:29:00.235
Let go of me.

01:29:00.302 --> 01:29:01.837
Calm down.

01:29:01.904 --> 01:29:06.442
Help me get her up here.
Careful, miss. That's it.

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:12.648
I only wanted to be with you.

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:17.886
Everything was for you.
Let's go.

01:29:20.889 --> 01:29:23.559
Are you sure you're okay?
Yeah, I'm fine now.

01:29:30.298 --> 01:29:34.002
Anna, Lydia.

01:29:39.675 --> 01:29:45.013
"For thereby some have
entertained angels unawares."

01:29:49.452 --> 01:29:51.019
It's over now.

01:29:52.755 --> 01:29:54.590
It's just the beginning.

01:30:03.566 --> 01:30:06.569
