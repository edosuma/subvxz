00:13.221 --> 00:15.181
- [Blonde Girl]
Oh, my God.

00:15.223 --> 00:16.641
[sighs]
That's hot.

00:16.683 --> 00:19.477
If my mom weren't such
a stupid bitch, I'd do it, too.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.104
At least she's
good for one thing.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.148
[gasps]
- No way.

00:23.189 --> 00:25.066
Oh, my God, I've been dying
for a ciggy all day.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.568
- Me, too.

00:26.609 --> 00:28.862
I heard Gwyneth Paltrow smokes,
like, two packs a day.

00:28.903 --> 00:29.988
- Oh, my God.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.114
- [Young Stone]
Hello, there, ladies.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.657
I saw that.

00:32.699 --> 00:34.409
[laughing]
I get it.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.202
You wanna be adults,
and that makes sense,

00:36.244 --> 00:37.370
two beautiful
young women.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.497
[groans]
- Sketchy much?

00:39.539 --> 00:41.916
- No, I was just giving you
a compliment.

00:41.958 --> 00:43.084
- [Bianca]
Okay, perv,

00:43.126 --> 00:44.836
you're old enough
to be my dad.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.212
[laughing]
Eww.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.714
- And you're old enough
to know the law.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.215
Now, give me the cigarettes,
and I'll forget about this.

00:49.257 --> 00:51.301
- Or what?
You'll arrest us?

00:51.343 --> 00:53.303
I mean, you're just
some mall cop.

00:53.345 --> 00:57.057
- No, I'm-I'm-I'm a member
of the Topeka P.D.

00:57.098 --> 01:00.018
[giggling]
- Oh, ooh.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.728
Oh, my God.
- I'm calling my mom.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.146
She's a lawyer.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.981
- I thought she didn't
pass the bar.

01:05.023 --> 01:06.316
- Shut up, Bianca.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.029
What the hell?

01:11.071 --> 01:13.073
I knew I should've
gotten a Razr.

01:13.114 --> 01:17.243
- [Boy] What the fuck?
What's going on?

01:17.285 --> 01:18.661
["Steal My Sunshine"
by Len playing]

01:18.703 --> 01:20.413
- [Boy] Free money!
- Oh, my god.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.457
- [Man]
Oh, hell, yeah!

01:24.626 --> 01:26.753
[whistling]

01:26.795 --> 01:27.796
[screaming]

01:27.837 --> 01:31.091
* I know it's up
for me *

01:31.132 --> 01:32.634
* If you steal my sunshine *

01:32.676 --> 01:36.096
* Making sure I'm not
in too deep *

01:36.137 --> 01:37.639
* If you steal my sunshine *

01:37.681 --> 01:40.475
* Keeping versed
and on my feet *

01:40.517 --> 01:43.937
* If you steal my sunshine *

01:43.978 --> 01:45.730
[grunting]
[electricity crackling]

01:45.772 --> 01:47.107
- That's for not doing
what you're told.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.192
- Yeah, follow directions!

01:49.234 --> 01:53.780
- Why don't you stay
in the car?

01:53.822 --> 01:55.448
[groans]

02:00.912 --> 02:01.830
[groaning continues]

02:01.871 --> 02:03.164
- Strip 'em and zip 'em.

02:03.206 --> 02:06.376
[groans]

02:06.418 --> 02:08.420
- I'm gonna take
your jacket off, okay?

02:08.461 --> 02:09.879
I'll give it back to you
when we're all done.

02:09.921 --> 02:11.131
And your gloves,
too, actually.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.298
- Stu, you don't
have to explain.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.551
Just do it.
- Okay.

02:14.592 --> 02:16.261
Let me know if it's
too tight.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.430
Hands up, please.
- [Mike] Stop saying, "Please."

02:18.471 --> 02:20.015
- [Stu] Okay, sorry.
- Hey, there.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.603
Oh, yeah, that wound
is still fresh, huh?

02:25.645 --> 02:28.440
Hmm...
[sniffs]

02:28.481 --> 02:31.317
Tell me, tough guy,
this your main squeeze,

02:31.359 --> 02:35.238
or is this some sort of
transactional arrangement?

02:35.280 --> 02:37.449
[laughing]

02:40.368 --> 02:41.828
Send 'em down
the purple line.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.955
- [Mike] You got it, boss.

02:43.997 --> 02:58.928
**

02:58.928 --> 02:59.804
**

02:59.846 --> 03:02.766
- Oh, my God.
It's a DMV.

03:02.807 --> 03:04.726
- A what?
- [Clerk] You have been detained

03:04.768 --> 03:07.145
for driving without
an open road license.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.189
You will now be
issued a license.

03:09.230 --> 03:11.649
If you decline,
you will walk the red line.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.194
If you are caught driving
without a license again,

03:14.235 --> 03:16.404
you will walk
the red line.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.198
- What's down the red line?

03:18.239 --> 03:22.202
- [Man] No, no, wait!
[screaming]

03:22.243 --> 03:24.245
- Cool, screams.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.539
[clears throat]
- Take 'em away.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.380
- Have fun, losers.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.175
[laughing]

03:37.217 --> 03:38.927
- Just to be clear,
I fucking hate you.

03:38.968 --> 03:40.011
- Same.

03:40.053 --> 03:47.519
**

03:47.560 --> 03:50.897
- Open, you stupid trunk.
Damn.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.190
- Cocoa butter?

03:52.232 --> 03:53.900
Mike, you ever tried
cocoa butter?

03:53.942 --> 03:55.819
- [Mike] Tried it?
- Ugh.

03:58.363 --> 04:01.366
[grunting]

04:01.408 --> 04:03.410
- [Mike] Come on.
Just fuckin'--

04:10.709 --> 04:12.085
Come on.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.546
- Hey, do-do you think
Agent Stone is kinda intense?

04:14.587 --> 04:17.090
I do not like it
when he smiles.

04:17.132 --> 04:19.384
- Shepard already gave me
the lowdown on Stone, okay?

04:19.426 --> 04:21.219
He's a legit hero.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.013
Get this, when the fall
happened, right,

04:23.054 --> 04:25.432
this terrorist group took over
this man's hometown.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.642
This guy stepped up
himself

04:27.684 --> 04:30.562
and single handedly
annihilated everybody

04:30.603 --> 04:32.647
with extreme prejudice.

04:32.689 --> 04:33.440
[laughing]

04:33.481 --> 04:37.318
- Extreme prejudice, cool.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.404
- Fuck.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.364
Man, you need
to fix this shit.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.200
- [Shepard]
Yoo-hoo, Mikey-Mike.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.536
Mmm, what's up?

04:46.578 --> 04:48.496
I really love the way you
tased that twat like...

04:48.538 --> 04:52.417
- Ahh!
[laughing]

04:52.459 --> 04:56.171
- Uh-oh.
Speaking of twats...

04:56.212 --> 04:58.590
What you got there,
big guy?

04:58.631 --> 05:00.967
- You know, you-you can
just call me Stu,

05:01.009 --> 05:02.469
and it's trash.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.179
- Well, you know, uh,

05:04.220 --> 05:07.515
as Stone says,
one man's trash is a--

05:11.144 --> 05:14.397
- Is what?

05:14.439 --> 05:17.025
- Oh, Goddamn.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.111
[grunting]

05:23.782 --> 05:26.159
- Hey, how'd you know
that old ratty cop out there,

05:26.201 --> 05:28.495
Shepard or whatever?

05:28.536 --> 05:31.331
So, we're back to this now?

05:31.373 --> 05:33.708
Fine, I can play
the quiet game, too.

05:38.963 --> 05:42.425
W-why won't you talk?

05:42.467 --> 05:44.511
Why won't you talk?
Why won't you talk?

05:44.552 --> 05:46.221
Why won't you talk?
- Why do you talk so much?

05:46.262 --> 05:47.180
- Look, this mouth
has gotten me out

05:47.222 --> 05:48.473
of a lotta
sticky situations.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.517
- Eww.
- Not like that.

05:50.558 --> 05:53.395
I mean, that happened, too.
[chuckling]

05:53.436 --> 05:56.648
Look, out here, silence
can get you killed.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.566
- Silence has kept me alive.
- Oh, yeah?

05:58.608 --> 06:01.027
So, why'd you tell that cop
to eat your ass?

06:01.069 --> 06:04.948
[door opening, footsteps]

06:09.703 --> 06:11.538
- [Stone]
Well, hello.

06:11.579 --> 06:14.290
It's a mystery how our paths
just keep crossing.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.752
My men say

06:17.794 --> 06:21.631
you have
a darling little voice.

06:21.673 --> 06:24.384
I'm excited to hear
what comes out of it.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.356
- Go ahead, drink up.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.495
Where we're sitting,

06:52.537 --> 06:55.707
there once flowed
a powerful river.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.168
Then they built
this architectural marvel.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.170
My father used to
bring me here for the tour

07:00.211 --> 07:01.379
when I was a child.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.007
The tour was a bit dry.

07:04.049 --> 07:06.343
- [Shepard] Ha!

07:06.384 --> 07:08.345
- Just a little
dam humor for ya.

07:08.386 --> 07:11.348
But now, the roads have all
become wild rivers,

07:11.389 --> 07:14.559
so I'm building my own blockade,
a dam, if you will.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.102
It runs from
Southern Arizona

07:16.144 --> 07:19.397
all the way
to the Canadian wastes,

07:19.439 --> 07:23.026
but the only way
through...

07:23.068 --> 07:25.028
is here.

07:25.070 --> 07:28.490
- Wow, cool story.

07:28.531 --> 07:31.117
There's been
a misunderstanding, all right?

07:31.159 --> 07:33.286
I'm not a criminal.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.538
I'm a milkman
on a delivery.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.248
Now I know you got
a beef with the girl.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.501
Pfft, that ain't got nothin'
to do with me, right?

07:39.542 --> 07:42.545
- I don't give a fuck
about your delivery.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.089
What I do give
a fuck about,

07:44.130 --> 07:47.884
is how you would happen
to have this.

07:47.926 --> 07:51.930
I have spent decades building
outposts and checkpoints,

07:51.971 --> 07:55.517
but this map manages to avoid
damn near every one.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.644
I want the name of
your cartographer.

07:57.686 --> 08:00.021
- My carta-ta-- my what?

08:00.063 --> 08:01.981
- Your mapmaker.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.900
- Oh, no, man.
I found that

08:03.942 --> 08:05.735
on the side
of the road, dude.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.529
Come on.
You want it, take it.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.197
- You really think
I'm that stupid?

08:09.239 --> 08:11.032
- No. No, no, no, no, no,
not at all.

08:11.074 --> 08:14.911
I know how this world
works, officer.

08:14.953 --> 08:17.414
- A little respect,
I appreciate that,

08:17.455 --> 08:20.000
but for the record,
it's Agent.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.585
- Even better,
Agent, uh, Stone.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.547
I didn't know this map
avoided your routes.

08:25.588 --> 08:26.756
I did not know.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.591
Now, I do know.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.844
So, how about I get
one of those licenses

08:30.885 --> 08:32.220
I keep hearing so much about,

08:32.262 --> 08:33.513
and I go on my merry way?

08:33.555 --> 08:35.265
[spits]
Whoa!

08:35.306 --> 08:36.850
Why'd you do that?

08:38.643 --> 08:40.145
[sighs]

08:42.605 --> 08:43.648
Oh, that
was unnecessary.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.108
[grunts]

08:50.488 --> 08:53.533
- Couldn't even
do it yourself.

08:57.829 --> 09:01.041
- We'll revisit that attitude
in a few hours.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.625
- Can't wait.

09:02.667 --> 09:07.964
**

09:08.006 --> 09:10.633
- Get the name
of the mapmaker.

09:10.675 --> 09:13.178
One leak could bring
the whole dam down.

09:15.347 --> 09:17.474
[distant gunfire, sirens]

09:17.515 --> 09:19.517
- Come on, come on,
hurry.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.977
- [Man] Let's go.
Get in back.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.855
- [Man] Don't matter
if it's legal.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.066
- That's the last one.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.028
- Hey, neighbor,
need some help?

09:30.070 --> 09:32.572
- [Young Stone]
Thanks, Margie.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.407
How are you and Rick
holding up?

09:34.449 --> 09:35.992
- Oh, it's scary
out there.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.619
Looters hit us
the other day.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.662
We went to the station
for help, but...

09:39.704 --> 09:40.747
- The station burned down.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.332
Yeah, bastards
torched it on Tuesday.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.000
It's every man for himself.
[gun cocking]

09:45.669 --> 09:48.380
Margie, what are you doing?

09:48.421 --> 09:50.006
- Rick, get in here!

09:50.048 --> 09:52.175
[panting]

09:52.217 --> 09:55.136
Get the gun.

09:55.178 --> 09:57.555
- Sorry, bro.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.557
- Check the back
for his rifles.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.142
Check the cabinets, too!

10:03.395 --> 10:05.438
- [Rick] Ain't nothing
back here but "Juggs!"

10:05.480 --> 10:06.856
- Of what?
Of-of water?

10:06.898 --> 10:08.692
- [Rick] No,
like the magazine,

10:08.733 --> 10:10.902
two Gs,
big boob porn.

10:10.944 --> 10:15.031
- Of course, Officer Stone
is into big titties.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.825
Pig.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.035
- I got 'em.
Let's jet.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.245
- Why are you guys
doing this?

10:20.286 --> 10:22.497
- Like you said,
every man for himself.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.708
We're getting out of this city
before it all goes up,

10:24.749 --> 10:28.003
and you've always been
kind of an asshole.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.212
Go.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.464
[grunts]

10:31.506 --> 10:33.216
Later, officer.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.849
- While I give you points
for velocity and precision,

10:40.890 --> 10:44.352
spit washing his face was
a stupid fuckin' idea.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.396
I was this close to
talking us outta here.

10:46.438 --> 10:47.731
Why did you do that?

10:47.772 --> 10:48.898
- Why didn't you tell him
who made your shitty map?

10:48.940 --> 10:50.275
- That's none of your business.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.234
- Oh, look at that.
You answer your own questions.

10:51.276 --> 10:52.736
- Yo, you're a pain
in my ass.

10:52.777 --> 10:53.903
- Oh, blow me.
- You wish.

10:53.945 --> 10:56.448
- Pfft, not likely.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.282
Prick.
- Asshole.

10:59.075 --> 11:02.203
- Stone is really counting
on us to get this info, man.

11:02.245 --> 11:04.289
So, we can't fuck
this up, Stu.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.002
- You say that like
I'm gonna fuck it up.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.588
- All I'm saying is,
we gotta go hard, okay?

11:11.629 --> 11:13.298
Put your game face on.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.424
Now what's our motto?

11:14.466 --> 11:15.967
- Big, swinging--

11:16.009 --> 11:17.469
- We got big swinging dicks.
- Swinging dicks.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.596
- That's right, and we're
in motherfucking charge.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.765
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.016
What the fuck is that?

11:23.058 --> 11:26.227
- It's American sign language
for big balls.

11:26.269 --> 11:31.358
**

11:31.399 --> 11:34.152
- Y'all got saws and shit
in there to torture us?

11:34.194 --> 11:36.613
- Tell us who made
that map,

11:36.654 --> 11:38.990
and you'll never need
to find out.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.659
- Ooh, you do this a lot.

11:41.701 --> 11:51.503
**

11:59.135 --> 12:02.430
- Fill out these forms
in triplicate.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.349
- That's scary.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.892
- Oh, it will be.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.061
- Yeah, it will be.

12:14.859 --> 12:18.279
- So, what if I don't
know my DOB?

12:18.321 --> 12:20.824
- It means date of birth.
- [John Doe] Okay.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.742
So, what if I don't
know that either?

12:32.377 --> 12:33.962
- Turn it on.

12:34.004 --> 12:37.215
* I'm a Barbie girl
in the Barbie world *

12:37.257 --> 12:38.383
[laughing]

12:38.425 --> 12:39.592
* Life in plastic
it's fantastic *

12:39.634 --> 12:41.594
- You're lucky
I love this song!

12:41.636 --> 12:42.929
- Not for long.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.639
* You can brush my hair
undress me everywhere *

12:44.681 --> 12:45.515
Louder!

12:45.557 --> 12:47.142
- Ahh!
* Imagination *

12:47.183 --> 12:48.977
* Life is your creation *

12:49.019 --> 12:50.854
* Come on Barbie
let's go party *

12:50.895 --> 12:51.521
* I'm a Barbie girl
in the Barbie world *

12:51.563 --> 12:54.399
- Get writing!

12:54.441 --> 12:56.026
* Life in plastic
it's fantastic *

12:56.067 --> 12:58.695
- [John Doe]
Why is the pencil so small?

12:58.737 --> 13:01.823
- That's all we got!
Keep writing!

13:01.865 --> 13:05.243
- N-P-X-T-Z.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.328
- Now, you.

13:07.370 --> 13:10.874
- F-U-C-K-U.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.167
- Eyes look a little dry,
don't they?

13:12.208 --> 13:15.211
- Aww, come on, man.
Ahh!

13:15.253 --> 13:17.464
- No, no, no, no!
Oh, God!

13:17.505 --> 13:18.882
Sorry.
Oh, my God. Ugh!

13:18.923 --> 13:21.259
[screaming]

13:21.301 --> 13:24.888
* You can touch
you can play *

13:24.929 --> 13:29.392
* If you say
I'm always yours *

13:29.434 --> 13:32.520
* I'm a Barbie girl
in the Barbie world *

13:32.562 --> 13:35.940
- Give us the mapmaker
or meet yours.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.275
- [John Doe]
Wait, did you mean

13:37.317 --> 13:40.945
you wanna meet the mapmaker
or meet your maker?

13:40.987 --> 13:42.781
[laughing]

13:42.822 --> 13:44.240
That would have been
a cool line,

13:44.282 --> 13:46.368
but you fucked
it up, player.

13:46.409 --> 13:48.328
[laughing]

13:51.122 --> 13:52.499
- No! No!
[screaming]

13:52.540 --> 13:54.793
* Make me walk make me talk
do whatever you please *

13:54.834 --> 13:56.586
* I can act like a star *

13:56.628 --> 13:58.338
* I can beg on my knees *

13:58.380 --> 14:00.090
* Come jump in
bimbo friend *

14:00.131 --> 14:02.050
* Let us do it again *

14:02.092 --> 14:05.762
* Hit the town fool around
let's go party *

14:05.804 --> 14:06.930
* You can touch *

14:06.971 --> 14:08.306
[stereo clicking, sighs]

14:08.348 --> 14:10.642
- [Stone] That used to be
my jam back in the day.

14:10.684 --> 14:15.563
So, you have anything
you'd like to share?

14:15.605 --> 14:18.149
- Yeah.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.944
I've known the mapmaker
for a long time.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.154
He's probably the only person
on this earth

14:23.196 --> 14:25.115
that I really trust.

14:25.156 --> 14:29.244
That's why I'll never
tell you his name.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.915
You can give me
1,000 more forms to fill out.

14:33.957 --> 14:36.167
They're fun.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.169
- I guess we're just
gonna have to send you

14:38.211 --> 14:40.964
down the red line then.

14:41.006 --> 14:44.134
And you,
you must be thrilled.

14:44.175 --> 14:46.928
You get to hug
your brother, again.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.555
[exhales]

14:48.596 --> 14:50.682
To think that he took
a bullet for you,

14:50.724 --> 14:51.850
and you just threw it away.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.688
Shame.

14:56.730 --> 14:57.605
Take 'em away.

15:01.026 --> 15:03.194
- I'll find you.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.488
- Oh, yeah?
Where?

15:05.530 --> 15:08.324
In the afterlife?

15:08.366 --> 15:10.118
Spooky.

15:13.872 --> 15:17.625
- [man] Let's go.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.004
- Listen, if there's
more maps out there,

15:21.046 --> 15:22.839
we could be compromised.

15:22.881 --> 15:26.009
- Want me to head to HQ?
- No.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.802
I'll handle it myself.

15:29.346 --> 15:34.351
**

15:34.392 --> 15:36.603
[crying]

15:39.731 --> 15:43.068
[knocking]

15:43.109 --> 15:46.071
- Officer, are you in here?

15:46.112 --> 15:48.239
I saw your police car
out in the driveway.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.949
- I cannot help you.

15:49.991 --> 15:51.993
- These guys,
these-these terrorists,

15:52.035 --> 15:54.329
they threw me
out of my restaurant.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.998
- Don't you get it?
The world is over.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.084
- That's why we need you.

16:02.587 --> 16:05.757
Too bad--
I thought you were a cop.

16:09.678 --> 16:24.609
**

16:38.957 --> 16:39.249
[beep]

16:40.458 --> 16:44.462
- [PA speaker]
B67-- that's B67.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.940
[screaming]

17:13.658 --> 17:18.079
- Guess I'm not gonna
finish this job.

17:18.121 --> 17:19.998
[grunting, screaming]

17:25.003 --> 17:28.381
[sighs]

17:28.423 --> 17:30.133
So, Stone
killed your brother, huh?

17:30.175 --> 17:32.177
- You know, sometimes
it's okay to shut the fuck up.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.678
- I was just--
you know what?

17:33.720 --> 17:36.181
Never mind, asshole.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.235
- Stone...

17:52.364 --> 17:53.531
He made my brother--

17:56.743 --> 17:59.079
He made him shoot himself.

18:01.539 --> 18:05.085
- That's messed up.

18:05.126 --> 18:07.587
Was he your only family?

18:10.423 --> 18:13.385
You know,
I had a family, too.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.719
- What a stunning admission.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.721
- If you let me finish...

18:21.184 --> 18:24.854
I was gonna say
I don't remember them.

18:24.896 --> 18:29.192
Like, my memory
is not that good.

18:31.695 --> 18:34.364
And no matter how hard I try,
I can't remember 'em.

18:34.406 --> 18:35.990
I can't see their faces.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.538
So, you were lucky
to have as much time

18:41.579 --> 18:43.331
with your brother
as you did.

18:46.042 --> 18:49.754
'Cause all I have
is a burnt photo and feelings.

18:51.840 --> 18:55.802
- Wow.
That is supremely fucked.

18:55.844 --> 18:57.220
[John Doe]
- Yeah, I know.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.347
That's why this delivery job
for New San Francisco--

18:59.389 --> 19:02.726
it was supposed to help me
get it back, you know.

19:02.767 --> 19:07.022
I mean, not the family,
but...

19:07.063 --> 19:10.650
the feeling,

19:10.692 --> 19:13.278
being a part of somethin'.

19:15.405 --> 19:16.489
[beep]

19:16.531 --> 19:18.408
[coughs]

19:18.450 --> 19:25.415
- [PA speaker]
B68-- that's B68.

19:25.457 --> 19:27.292
- Maybe we should try
and kill each other right here

19:27.334 --> 19:28.710
for old times sakes.

19:28.752 --> 19:31.296
[chuckles]

19:31.338 --> 19:33.590
- All right, bud,
you're up.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.425
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No.

19:35.467 --> 19:37.594
You, do it.

19:37.635 --> 19:38.511
- I'll handle these
douche nozzles.

19:38.553 --> 19:40.388
- Mm-hmm.

19:41.639 --> 19:45.560
**

19:45.602 --> 19:46.853

It's Stu, right?

19:46.895 --> 19:48.021
I mean, or you go by Stuart?

19:48.063 --> 19:49.147
Like, what is your--
what do you go by?

19:49.189 --> 19:52.233
- Sh-shut up.
- My bad, big man.

19:54.444 --> 19:57.655
- Big man?
Go fuck yourself!

19:57.697 --> 20:00.033
You don't think I know
what "big man" means

20:00.075 --> 20:03.620
or, uh, "papa bear",
or "boss,"

20:03.661 --> 20:06.206
or "Plus Size Polly,"

20:06.247 --> 20:07.957
or "Big-titted Timmy,"

20:07.999 --> 20:09.793
or, "Hey, you know what
who you look like?"

20:09.834 --> 20:12.671
Oh, let me guess,
fuckin' Bruce Vilanch.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.256
I get it.
I'm not petite, okay?

20:15.298 --> 20:17.258
So, don't patronize me.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.762
How would you like
to be called, uh, uh--

20:20.804 --> 20:21.971
how are you
so Goddamn good-lookin'?

20:22.013 --> 20:23.807
- I mean, his breath
smells like shit.

20:23.848 --> 20:24.974
- Why would you even say that?
- Oh, God,

20:25.016 --> 20:27.560
I can smell it from here.

20:27.602 --> 20:29.270
- Oh, shit.

20:32.357 --> 20:35.819
- [Stu] Open it.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.446
Open it.
Go on.

20:41.491 --> 20:43.201
[screaming]

20:44.744 --> 20:46.287
- Oh, it's so high!
It's so high!

20:46.329 --> 20:48.498
It's so high! Oh, God,
I fuckin' hate heights!

20:48.540 --> 20:50.083
- Yeah, I hate
fuckin' hate dyin'!

20:50.125 --> 20:51.710
Hey, look,
we're not gonna jump, man.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.003
- And I'm not negotiating.

20:53.044 --> 20:54.838
This is where
the red line ends.

20:54.879 --> 20:57.632
- Look, Stu, your friend
has a cold heart,

20:57.674 --> 20:59.592
but I see you, Stu.

20:59.634 --> 21:01.344
You're not that guy.
You're a good guy.

21:02.762 --> 21:08.143
- Either you jump,
or you fall.

21:08.184 --> 21:10.353
- Then go ahead
and fuckin' shoot us!

21:10.395 --> 21:11.688
We're not gonna do your job.

21:11.730 --> 21:12.856
Go ahead.
Fire away!

21:12.897 --> 21:15.191
Blow our fuckin' heads off!

21:15.233 --> 21:18.236
- Stone played this game with me
and my brother, Stu.

21:18.278 --> 21:19.571
It's about power!

21:19.612 --> 21:21.990
You wanna feel that power?
You wanna be like Stone?

21:22.032 --> 21:24.034
Then go ahead.
Shoot us.

21:24.075 --> 21:26.244
But you have to
finish the job!

21:26.286 --> 21:28.371
- [John Doe] Do it!
- [Quiet] Come on, do it!

21:28.413 --> 21:30.874
Do it!
- Do it!

21:30.915 --> 21:32.709
- If I don't kill you,
I'm dead.

21:32.751 --> 21:33.835
- Not if you're in the car

21:33.877 --> 21:36.254
speeding your ass
outta here with us, Stu.

21:40.091 --> 21:41.468
- Fuck.

21:42.344 --> 21:45.305
**

21:45.347 --> 21:46.681
- You gonna get
a commemorative t-shirt?

21:46.723 --> 21:48.141
I thought you were
more of a snow globe guy.

21:48.183 --> 21:50.560
- Do you ever stop talking?
- No.

21:50.602 --> 21:51.936
- Come on.
Yeah, okay.

21:55.607 --> 21:57.150
- Keys, keys, keys,
right here.

21:57.192 --> 21:58.276
Here we go.

21:59.527 --> 22:01.654
What do your keys look like?
- [John Doe] Keys.

22:01.696 --> 22:04.199
- [Stu] Okay, how many ridges
are on them or teeth?

22:04.240 --> 22:05.116
- [John Doe]
They look like keys.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.493
I don't know.
It's-it's a key.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.953
- [Stu] Please be more specific.
I don't know keys.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.997
I'm not a locksmith
or a keymaster.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.377
- Got it.

22:15.418 --> 22:17.796
- Where'd your friend go?
- Goddamn it, Quiet.

22:19.172 --> 22:20.340
Fuck it.
We gotta leave her.

22:20.382 --> 22:24.094
**

22:28.807 --> 22:29.933

are in there?

22:29.974 --> 22:32.936

22:32.977 --> 22:35.438
- [Officer Stone]
I'll handle this.

23:03.925 --> 23:05.218
- [woman] Hey, come on, honey.
Come over here.

23:05.260 --> 23:06.219

23:06.261 --> 23:08.596

of the law!

23:12.559 --> 23:14.144
Wait, you are the terrorists?

23:14.185 --> 23:16.938
- Officer?
- We had nowhere else to go.

23:16.980 --> 23:18.898
The grocery stores
were all looted.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.859
We only came here
to get food for our families,

23:20.900 --> 23:23.028
and then the owner freaked out.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.612
There's enough snake-sketti
and coconut shrimp here

23:24.654 --> 23:26.573
to feed hundreds of people.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.575
- Look, lots of people
are struggling, right now,

23:28.616 --> 23:31.995
but hunger is not an excuse
to break the law.

23:32.037 --> 23:35.999
Leave now.
- Wait, I know you.

23:36.041 --> 23:37.667
I see him around here
all the time.

23:37.709 --> 23:40.170
This dude is
a fucking rent-a-cop.

23:40.211 --> 23:42.130
- Uh, the mall
is part of my patrol.

23:42.172 --> 23:45.091
I'm a real cop.
- You don't act like one.

23:45.133 --> 23:47.052
Tellin' folks
not to double park.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.346
Sweating little kids
stealing candy.

23:49.387 --> 23:51.348
That make you feel like
a big, powerful man?

23:51.389 --> 23:54.851
- I need you to
vacate the premises, please.

23:54.893 --> 23:57.437
- "Vacate the premises, please."

23:57.479 --> 23:59.689
[laughter]

23:59.731 --> 24:02.317
Look at you
trying to look tough.

24:02.359 --> 24:04.027
That uniform
barely has a crease in it.

24:04.069 --> 24:06.112
Shoes still shiny.

24:06.154 --> 24:09.699
How is a pathetic, worthless,
pencil dick of a mall cop--

24:09.741 --> 24:12.285
[gunfire]

24:13.370 --> 24:15.955
[gun clicking]

24:15.997 --> 24:18.667
- I told you!
I am a man of the law!

24:33.848 --> 24:35.725
Oh, no.

24:35.767 --> 24:39.270
[hyperventilating]

24:44.526 --> 24:47.237
You did this!
I was here to help!

24:47.278 --> 24:50.031
You had to resist!
This is your fault!

24:50.073 --> 24:51.700
You broke the law!

24:53.451 --> 25:07.590
**

25:13.805 --> 25:15.765
[rhythmic squeaking]

25:15.807 --> 25:19.227
[grunting]

25:20.520 --> 25:22.230
[moaning]

25:22.272 --> 25:23.898
- Oh, shit!
Sorry, boss.

25:23.940 --> 25:25.775
I thought you were
already headed to HQ.

25:25.817 --> 25:27.444
- Where is Stone?

25:31.322 --> 25:34.325
- I got two stones for you,
right here.

25:34.367 --> 25:37.912
- Oh, are we flirting now?

25:37.954 --> 25:39.039
[laughing]

25:39.080 --> 25:41.166
More like pebbles.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.126
I remember what
your fuckhead boss said

25:43.168 --> 25:44.627
about how if someone
tells your story,

25:44.669 --> 25:47.130
it lives on forever.

25:47.172 --> 25:48.673
You'll be remembered
as the guy who died

25:48.715 --> 25:50.425
with his dick in his hand.

25:50.467 --> 25:52.510
[screaming]

25:55.972 --> 26:02.437
**

26:02.479 --> 26:04.606
[screaming]

26:28.088 --> 26:29.673
- What the fuck
did you do, Stu?

26:31.591 --> 26:33.385
The prisoners are loose.

26:37.722 --> 26:40.100
- [Quiet] HQ.

26:52.529 --> 26:52.821
- Oh, Ev.

26:54.155 --> 26:56.282
Oh, what did they do
to your beautiful body, baby?

26:56.324 --> 26:59.285
Fuck.
Damn it!

27:01.329 --> 27:02.706
Come on, baby.

27:02.747 --> 27:05.917
[sirens]

27:05.959 --> 27:08.420
Which one of you assholes
left the dome light on?

27:08.461 --> 27:10.005
- Uh, who was in the car last?

27:10.046 --> 27:12.424
Uh, uh--
- Get out and push!

27:12.465 --> 27:14.676
- Okay.
Wasn't me.

27:16.678 --> 27:18.847
[groaning]

27:29.065 --> 27:30.608
Go! I got it!

27:30.650 --> 27:34.362
[groaning]

27:35.321 --> 27:37.365
[engine revving]

27:37.407 --> 27:39.200
- Stu, you're my hero!

27:39.242 --> 27:40.326
We couldn't have did it
without you!

27:40.368 --> 27:43.705
- He's not here.
- I gotta fix that trunk.

27:43.747 --> 27:46.708
Should we go back and get him?
- Are you shitting me?

27:46.750 --> 27:47.876
- You're right.

27:47.917 --> 27:49.919
Jello, Stu.

27:51.921 --> 27:53.548
[laughing]

27:53.590 --> 27:57.927
**

28:03.099 --> 28:06.770
[groaning]

28:12.400 --> 28:16.321
- Mike, they overpowered me.

28:16.363 --> 28:19.282
- If you ain't with us,
you're against us.

28:25.121 --> 28:27.332
- [John Doe] Did they really
have to strip all your guns?

28:27.374 --> 28:28.583
That's just mean.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.377
- They take everything?
- Yeah, no weapons,

28:30.418 --> 28:32.003
which means I'm gonna be
clinching my cheeks

28:32.045 --> 28:35.256
all the way to New Chicago.

28:35.298 --> 28:38.218
Aww, man, they took
my cocoa butter.

28:38.259 --> 28:40.178
Now, I'm gonna be ashy, too.

28:40.220 --> 28:41.262
Look, I need to
make up some time,

28:41.304 --> 28:42.389
so is there any way
I can drop you

28:42.430 --> 28:44.474
between here and New Chicago?

28:46.810 --> 28:49.354
- Yeah, there is.

28:49.396 --> 28:50.397
Growing up, my brother,
he used to tell me

28:50.438 --> 28:53.066
about how before the fall,

28:53.108 --> 28:57.862
people lived in cities
without walls, without fear.

28:57.904 --> 29:00.365
We were trying to get to
a place like that.

29:00.407 --> 29:02.325
- Well, I'm sorry to
break the news to you, sister,

29:02.367 --> 29:04.285
but all those cities
are gone.

29:04.327 --> 29:06.496
- No, not all of them.

29:08.415 --> 29:11.710
There's a sanctuary city
in the Midwest.

29:11.751 --> 29:13.003
That's where
we were headed before...

29:16.089 --> 29:18.008
things got fucked.

29:20.969 --> 29:24.014
- Well, does this sanctuary city
have a name?

29:29.144 --> 29:36.151
- HQ.
Topeka.

29:36.192 --> 29:51.124
**

29:51.124 --> 29:51.750
**

30:03.261 --> 30:18.109
