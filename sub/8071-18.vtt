WEBVTT

00:09.543 --> 00:10.911
Aren't you even a
little bit curious

00:11.011 --> 00:13.281
about who bought our old house?

00:13.381 --> 00:15.183
How come you're so
obsessed with this?

00:15.283 --> 00:17.318
Well, it's where we grew up!

00:17.418 --> 00:19.387
I'm just surprised that you
don't have any feelings for it

00:19.487 --> 00:20.654
at all.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.890
Well, God, It's not like
it's the first McDonald's

00:22.990 --> 00:25.093
or something.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.394
Look at that.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.862
Final notice from my
insurance company.

00:28.962 --> 00:31.399
Well, good.
I was sick of hearing from 'em.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.105
It's special.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.439
It's our house.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.340
Hey, Jackie.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.741
You forget.

00:40.841 --> 00:44.578
Ever since dad sold this house,
it's also become home to three

00:44.678 --> 00:48.015
other dysfunctional families.

00:48.116 --> 00:48.982
I'm gonna change.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.184
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.085
Hey.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.920
Hey.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.388
What?

00:54.488 --> 00:57.125
What are you doing
upstairs with some boy?

00:57.225 --> 00:58.492
Well, no one was
home, so I figured,

00:58.592 --> 00:59.660
why not become a woman?

01:03.664 --> 01:05.499
Cut it out, Darlene.

01:05.599 --> 01:06.834
She's not a woman, Mrs. Connor.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.369
Nothing was going on.

01:08.469 --> 01:09.370
Excuse me.

01:09.470 --> 01:12.140
I'm waiting for
her to lie to me.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.007
I don't have to
explain myself to you.

01:14.108 --> 01:14.942
Oh yes, you do.

01:15.042 --> 01:17.711
See how big I am?

01:17.811 --> 01:18.846
We were working on this.

01:18.946 --> 01:20.314
It's a comic book.
I do the drawings.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.215
She writes down words.

01:21.315 --> 01:22.616
Oh, don't show 'em to her.

01:22.716 --> 01:23.551
Chill out.

01:23.651 --> 01:24.918
This is what you
were working on?

01:25.018 --> 01:26.254
Yes.

01:26.354 --> 01:29.523
Zombies eating
people's brains?

01:29.623 --> 01:30.558
Well, it's not done yet.

01:33.294 --> 01:34.795
Yeah, but I see
what it's saying.

01:34.895 --> 01:38.799
It's saying that you were not
upstairs groping my daughter.

01:38.899 --> 01:41.835
I like it.

01:41.935 --> 01:42.903
I'm gonna take off.

01:43.003 --> 01:43.804
All right.

01:43.904 --> 01:44.872
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

01:44.972 --> 01:46.507
You're going?

01:46.607 --> 01:48.209
Yeah, I guess.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.109
All right, me too.

01:52.913 --> 01:53.847
Can you believe her?

01:53.947 --> 01:56.450
She just had to embarrass me.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.952
Well, you gotta
understand, Darlene.

01:59.052 --> 02:00.621
That's not just any guy there.

02:00.721 --> 02:01.922
That's Mark's brother.

02:02.022 --> 02:03.291
Well, that's not his fault.

02:03.391 --> 02:06.059
Well, maybe she'll
see that eventually.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.629
I mean, look at
these drawings.

02:08.729 --> 02:09.530
Oh yeah.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.131
These are great.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.667
You guys put a lot
of time in on this.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.303
Yeah, a couple weeks.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.671
I mean, I think of the
story, and he draws it up.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.407
We're totally in sync.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.141
And we got the stories
worked out for a couple more.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.110
It's gonna be a whole series.

02:23.211 --> 02:24.512
And they're not
just comic books.

02:24.612 --> 02:25.413
They're graphic novels.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.153
What?

02:33.254 --> 02:35.989
Oh, it's just great to
see you like this, Darlene.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.326
You know, excited
about something!

02:38.426 --> 02:39.660
Oh, man.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.196
Well, I mean, ever since
you quit basketball--

02:42.296 --> 02:43.096
Stop it.

02:43.197 --> 02:44.131
All right.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.065
Could I read it?

02:45.165 --> 02:45.966
I guess.

02:52.540 --> 02:56.810
Oh, I'm just so proud of you!

02:56.910 --> 02:59.480
That's quite enough.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.982
[theme music]

03:50.931 --> 03:53.334
Clyde's fish died today.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.234
That's a shame.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.569
Was he sad?

03:55.669 --> 03:57.971
Yeah, but he felt better
after we put it in the street

03:58.071 --> 03:59.373
and watched a car smash it.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.813
DJ, we're eating!

04:05.913 --> 04:08.316
So Beck, you're going out
with Mark on Saturday, huh?

04:08.416 --> 04:12.353
Jackie, I said we're eating.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.587
Well, it's not a date.

04:13.687 --> 04:14.988
He just wants to talk.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.957
Oh, it can be pretty
tough to do with his tongue

04:17.057 --> 04:17.958
crammed down your throat.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.996
Darlene, it's over between us.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.465
But I think he
misses me and wants,

04:24.565 --> 04:26.934
you know, to come crawling back.

04:27.034 --> 04:27.835
That's it.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.604
I'm not hungry at all anymore.

04:30.704 --> 04:34.542
Well, then how come he didn't
ask you out for Friday night?

04:34.642 --> 04:35.909
What do you mean?

04:36.009 --> 04:39.680
Well, you gotta wonder what
other moron he's crawling to.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.515
Well, what did you hear?
Did David say something?

04:41.615 --> 04:42.916
Is he going out
with somebody else?

04:43.016 --> 04:44.117
Well, why should do you care?

04:44.217 --> 04:46.754
I thought it was over
between you and Bag Head.

04:46.854 --> 04:47.655
Well, it is.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.390
I don't care.
- Well, good.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.324
Nobody cares.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.292
New topic!

04:52.393 --> 04:53.193
Oh, look.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.261
Daddy's home.

04:54.362 --> 04:57.398
We'll talk about daddy.

04:57.498 --> 04:58.466
Sorry I'm late.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.401
I got to talking with
Mark at the shop.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.301
Really?

05:01.402 --> 05:02.370
What did he say?

05:02.470 --> 05:04.004
Well, it wasn't about you.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.539
It was about David.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.376
Mark said he cut school the
other day and went to Chicago.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.611
I can't believe he
ratted out his own brother.

05:10.711 --> 05:13.080
Well, I think he
was proud of the kid.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.615
But I don't want you
hanging around with David

05:14.715 --> 05:16.750
if he's gonna be pulling
this kind of crap.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.119
Well, how come
he was in Chicago?

05:19.219 --> 05:20.253
Well, how should I know?

05:20.354 --> 05:24.358
It was something about
a comic book convention.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.459
Comic book convention, huh?

05:28.095 --> 05:29.329
Because, you know, I
can call the school

05:29.430 --> 05:32.933
and find out if you ditched too.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.002
The convention was only gonna
be there for like two days.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.336
You went to Chicago with him?

05:36.437 --> 05:37.938
Let's not make a
big deal out of this.

05:38.038 --> 05:42.309
Oh, I am gonna make a
huge deal out of this.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.611
You kidding me?

05:43.711 --> 05:45.613
You get up to go to school
and you wind up in Chicago?

05:45.713 --> 05:46.580
And we don't even know?

05:46.680 --> 05:47.548
Something could have
happened to you,

05:47.648 --> 05:48.782
and we wouldn't
even know about it.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.918
How could you do
something so stupid?

05:51.018 --> 05:51.819
Well, we took the bus.

05:51.919 --> 05:52.720
Nothing happened.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.488
Till now.
You're grounded.

05:54.588 --> 05:55.589
You are so grounded.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.890
And don't think
you're just gonna lay

05:56.990 --> 05:58.258
around up in your room neither.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.793
You're gonna do
something useful.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.730
And you're gonna hate it.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.566
Or else we'll think of
something even more useful.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.835
Doesn't anybody
wanna know why we went?

06:07.935 --> 06:09.670
And you're not gonna
see David no more either.

06:09.770 --> 06:10.838
Why?

06:10.938 --> 06:14.107
Because of him you
lied, you went to Chicago,

06:14.207 --> 06:15.308
and you skipped school.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.977
You need more?

06:17.077 --> 06:18.479
The convention
was important to us.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.914
We went because we're
serious about this stuff.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.215
You can do better
than that, Darlene.

06:28.989 --> 06:29.790
I can't believe this.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.101
So did Mark say where he was
going after he left the shop?

06:50.811 --> 06:53.013
Hey, can I have some
of that chocolate?

06:53.113 --> 06:54.014
No, DJ.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.449
It's baker's chocolate.

06:55.549 --> 06:56.717
You won't like it.

06:56.817 --> 06:57.718
Please?

06:57.818 --> 06:59.386
No, it doesn't
have any sugar in it.

06:59.487 --> 07:00.287
Come on.

07:00.387 --> 07:03.223
It won't spoil my dinner.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.257
OK, go for it.

07:09.663 --> 07:10.998
Ew, it's awful!

07:14.001 --> 07:16.970
Well, I guess that's a lesson
every kid's gotta learn once,

07:17.070 --> 07:17.871
huh?

07:17.971 --> 07:19.039
Yeah, are you kidding?

07:19.139 --> 07:22.409
He does that every single
time I bake a cake.

07:22.510 --> 07:23.744
Hey.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.479
Hi, Arnie.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.280
- How are you doing, Arnie?
- I'm doing pretty good.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.682
Listen, Dan said I
could borrow the truck.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.850
You got the keys?

07:29.950 --> 07:33.386
Yeah, they're on
that hook there.

07:33.487 --> 07:34.655
That chocolate.

07:38.892 --> 07:39.693
Yeah, help yourself.

07:39.793 --> 07:40.594
Thanks.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.266
Hey, listen.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.801
I got a a little-- a
little problem with Nancy.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.670
And I know she
listens to you guys.

07:49.770 --> 07:50.738
What's going on?

07:50.838 --> 07:51.805
Well, she's driving me nuts.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.073
You know, she keeps
trying to change me.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.575
She says I got potential.

07:59.747 --> 08:03.651
Well, do you want me to
set her straight, Arnie?

08:03.751 --> 08:05.953
Would you?

08:06.053 --> 08:07.454
Now, what are you
gonna do with the truck?

08:07.555 --> 08:08.522
Well, see, mine's in the shop.

08:08.622 --> 08:09.990
And I made a deal with
a demolition crew.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.559
I'm gonna salvage all
the old copper pipes

08:11.659 --> 08:13.026
that [inaudible] old place.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.194
Demolition?

08:14.294 --> 08:15.362
Yeah, they're tearing it down.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.364
They're gonna put
up a Burger Heaven.

08:17.464 --> 08:19.166
- I can't believe this.
- It's great, man.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.768
The whole block's
gonna smell like chili.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.908
You know, Rosie, I
didn't wanna say nothing,

08:28.008 --> 08:30.477
but there's something really
wrong with this stuff.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.168
You know, Darlene, I've
never seen you look quite

08:55.268 --> 08:58.906
as lovely as you do right now.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.174
I can't believe you
didn't get busted too.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.109
I was.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.376
I'm in my room right now.

09:03.476 --> 09:05.412
And when I'm ready to admit
I'm wrong, I can come out.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.383
Oh no.

09:10.483 --> 09:11.484
DAVID: What?

09:11.585 --> 09:12.620
I just found my old hamster.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.525
Darlene, your mom said
you had some stuff of my--

09:18.626 --> 09:19.860
man.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.629
Well, you've seen me.

09:21.729 --> 09:24.064
Now you must die.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.999
You, get out of here.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.467
You won't tell anybody?

09:27.567 --> 09:30.003
Live in fear, David.

09:30.103 --> 09:33.273
I can do that.

09:33.373 --> 09:37.577
Hey, your mom catches
him in here, you're dead.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.047
Thanks for the tip.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.816
I see you're doing
a pretty good job.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.852
What do you want?

09:44.952 --> 09:46.519
You mad at me?

09:46.620 --> 09:48.321
Why would I be mad at you?

09:48.421 --> 09:50.924
Just because you sat there
and let them dump all over me.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.860
Look, if you want me
to say it's OK for you

09:52.960 --> 09:54.728
to go up to Chicago
and not tell anybody,

09:54.828 --> 09:56.129
I'm not gonna do that, Darlene.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.231
Well, you could have told them
how important this was to me.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.033
I mean, they think this
comic book convention is just

10:00.133 --> 10:01.702
some lame excuse for
me to cut school,

10:01.802 --> 10:03.103
and you know that's wrong.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.405
And they think that me and David
are just like Mark and Becky.

10:05.505 --> 10:06.506
And you know that's wrong too!

10:06.606 --> 10:08.842
I couldn't say anything.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.210
Well, you sure
said plenty to me,

10:10.310 --> 10:12.079
like how proud you were of me,
how great it was that I was

10:12.179 --> 10:13.446
finally getting into something.

10:13.546 --> 10:14.381
They were mad.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.549
They weren't gonna listen to me.

10:16.650 --> 10:17.651
Yeah, you're right.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.019
The best thing to do
was just to sit there

10:19.119 --> 10:22.055
and let them dump all over me.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.156
Darlene!

10:23.256 --> 10:24.057
Just leave me alone.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.047
Thanks for
picking me up, Beck.

10:47.147 --> 10:47.948
Oh, no problem.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.150
Hey, DJ, where's mom?

10:50.250 --> 10:51.184
She went out.

10:51.284 --> 10:55.088
She said she'd be
back in an hour.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.089
Hey, dad.

10:56.189 --> 10:59.026
How com Mark couldn't
drive you home?

10:59.126 --> 11:01.661
Oh, he left early.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.163
Hm.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.498
Well, he-- he usually
doesn't leave early, does he?

11:05.598 --> 11:06.399
He did tonight.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.240
Did he smell
good when he left?

11:13.340 --> 11:16.376
I try not to sniff
the help, Becky.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.345
BECKY: Well, you
know what I mean.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.080
I don't know if he's
dating anyone else, OK?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.448
OK, fine.

11:21.548 --> 11:22.983
It's just that you're alone
in the shop with him all day.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.417
And he's always been
a perfect gentleman.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.120
Never laid a hand on me.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.055
Hey.

11:28.155 --> 11:28.956
What?

11:29.056 --> 11:31.624
Nothing, just hey.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.093
You done out there?

11:33.193 --> 11:35.495
Well, I guess
that'd be up to you.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.831
Hey, I got an idea.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.933
Since mom's gonna be gone
for a little bit longer,

11:40.033 --> 11:41.068
let's get a pizza.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.470
Darlene, what don't
you want on your half?

11:43.570 --> 11:44.671
I'm just gonna
have this upstairs.

11:48.675 --> 11:49.843
Oh, here we go again.

11:49.943 --> 11:50.778
Yup.

11:50.878 --> 11:51.912
Now she's gonna
sit up in her room

11:52.012 --> 11:53.747
and mope for another six months.

11:53.847 --> 11:57.818
She's so immature.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.019
Good, he's home!

12:08.428 --> 12:11.431
J, we should just
ask Arnie for the key.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.166
Oh, we'll be in in a minute.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.405
Oh, the branch is
creaking, Jackie.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.608
It never creaked back
when we were kids.

12:21.708 --> 12:27.981
Well, the, tree's older
now, and you're older now too.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.051
Hey, we both fall at
the same speed, slim.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.420
I'm-- I'm hurrying.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.321
Yeah.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.823
Oh, yeah.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.859
All these years, and
nobody ever fixed that.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.093
Oh, just get in.

12:45.498 --> 12:48.135
Nice branch.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.904
Good branch.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.240
Strong branch.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.141
Oh.

12:57.811 --> 12:58.946
Whoa.

12:59.046 --> 13:01.348
I just flashed on Winnie
the Pooh and the honey tree.

13:04.885 --> 13:05.752
Just get me in here!

13:09.789 --> 13:13.093
Oh, how many times you
think we did that, huh?

13:13.193 --> 13:14.828
You sneaking in
after seeing Dan,

13:14.928 --> 13:16.463
and you're supposed
to have been studying.

13:16.563 --> 13:17.831
Oh man.

13:17.931 --> 13:21.001
About now, I'd be wondering
if I remembered my underwear.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.472
Shh!

13:25.572 --> 13:27.107
You'll wake up mom and dad.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.176
You were supposed to
have been home by 11:00.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.644
Well, after the party,
you know, me and Dan,

13:31.744 --> 13:33.780
we went over to his house
and we had three kids.

13:37.217 --> 13:40.487
Don't tell mom!

13:40.587 --> 13:42.789
Wow, our room.

13:42.890 --> 13:43.756
Ew, ew!

13:43.857 --> 13:45.993
It even smells like the same.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.327
Yeah.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.730
Ew, you know that smell of
burned meat and oppression.

13:54.868 --> 13:55.668
Hey, look, Jackie.

13:55.768 --> 13:56.636
There's the vent.

13:56.736 --> 13:57.670
Yeah.

13:57.770 --> 13:59.272
Yeah, mom and dad
never did figure out

13:59.372 --> 14:01.241
we could hear everything
that went on in their bedroom

14:01.341 --> 14:03.376
through that vent.

14:03.476 --> 14:07.014
Screaming, and
yelling, and crying.

14:07.114 --> 14:10.550
Yeah, we never
did hear any sex.

14:10.650 --> 14:14.854
Unless that's what all the
crying and yelling was about.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.890
Well, it helped us
figure out how bad

14:16.990 --> 14:18.525
the trouble we were in, though.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.626
That's true.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.094
Five minutes before
the knock on the door.

14:21.194 --> 14:21.995
Right, yeah.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.296
But that was a help.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.899
Gave us a chance to run
in and confess, you know?

14:25.999 --> 14:28.301
Score those honesty points.

14:28.401 --> 14:31.571
Yeah, or get our
story straight.

14:31.671 --> 14:32.973
But you remember
the week that we

14:33.073 --> 14:34.307
took turns listening
to the vent,

14:34.407 --> 14:36.209
to see if they found
out about Bloomington?

14:36.309 --> 14:38.611
Oh yeah, that frat party?

14:38.711 --> 14:41.114
We were way too mature
for high school guys.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.516
Yeah, so we end up
with these future doctors

14:43.616 --> 14:48.321
and lawyers playing up, up
and away on their armpits.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.657
Yeah, We slept in a car.

14:50.757 --> 14:53.160
What were we thinking?

14:53.260 --> 14:55.996
We could have gotten
really hurt, you know?

14:56.096 --> 15:00.233
And mom and dad had
no idea where we were.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.270
But I guess that's just the
crazy kind of stuff kids do.

15:09.642 --> 15:14.948
Oh gee, Jackie that sounds
just like what Darlene did.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.617
I guess I'm just
no better than her.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.219
How could I be so blind?

15:21.821 --> 15:23.957
My point exactly.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.525
You know, Jackie,
when you remember

15:25.625 --> 15:28.028
to water your Chia
pet, you can criticize

15:28.128 --> 15:29.296
the way I raise my kid.

15:32.032 --> 15:32.832
Roseanne, wait.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.005
Come on.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.907
OK, so, you know,
what we did was stupid.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.642
But if we would
have gotten caught,

15:42.742 --> 15:45.678
we would have gotten busted,
and we would've deserved it.

15:45.778 --> 15:49.616
Yes, but Darlene says that
what she did was important.

15:49.716 --> 15:53.586
She said the same thing
when she shaved DJ's head.

15:53.686 --> 15:56.323
Well, the comic book thing
seems to mean a lot to her.

15:56.423 --> 15:57.257
And I believe her.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.558
Why?

15:58.658 --> 16:00.327
Because she gave me hell
for not sticking up for her.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.562
And usually when she's mad at
you, she's really nice to me.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.697
And now it's like
we're on the same side,

16:04.797 --> 16:07.767
and that just stinks.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.002
OK, so all right.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.870
This thing is really
important to her.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.240
But I never told her she had
to quit the comic book thing.

16:13.340 --> 16:14.607
Well, yeah, you did, kind of.

16:14.707 --> 16:15.908
Because David does the pictures.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.548
OK, OK, I get it.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.449
Shut up.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.117
All right.

16:24.217 --> 16:25.985
You're welcome.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.521
Hey, it's our
living room, Jackie.

16:28.621 --> 16:29.456
Yeah.

16:29.556 --> 16:32.192
Couch there, TV there.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.994
Blue barcalounger.

16:35.095 --> 16:39.066
Green shag carpeting as
far as the eye could see.

16:39.166 --> 16:42.802
Hey, now, you remember that
oil painting that was up there?

16:42.902 --> 16:44.504
It was a picture of
a long windy road

16:44.604 --> 16:46.173
that just kind of
went off to nowhere?

16:46.273 --> 16:49.209
I used to stare at
that thing for hours.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.343
Yeah, that's
because I told you

16:50.443 --> 16:54.581
it was the "Andy Griffith Show."

16:54.681 --> 16:55.915
You were so mean to me.

16:56.015 --> 16:56.983
I was not!

16:57.084 --> 16:57.917
Yes, you were!

16:58.017 --> 16:59.719
You used to lie to
me all the time!

16:59.819 --> 17:03.022
You'd tease me and pinch me,
and mom would just say "Oh just

17:03.123 --> 17:05.525
ignore her and she'll stop."

17:05.625 --> 17:08.395
Mom never understood me.

17:08.495 --> 17:11.398
My field hockey
trophy was right here.

17:11.498 --> 17:17.304
And this is the clock that
mom got when Aunt Betty died.

17:17.404 --> 17:18.371
The fish!

17:18.471 --> 17:20.039
Oh God, yeah!

17:20.140 --> 17:23.176
Oh, dad's stuffed
swordfish deal.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.511
Yeah.

17:24.611 --> 17:27.180
Yeah, I remember crying when
he brought that thing home.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.915
Yeah, that's because I
told you it was Flipper.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.621
God, I--

17:34.721 --> 17:36.089
I was such an idiot.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.464
And remember what
was over there, Jackie?

17:44.564 --> 17:45.965
Come on, Roseanne.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.267
We don't need to get into this.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.501
We're having a good time here.

17:48.601 --> 17:49.569
Come on.

17:49.669 --> 17:50.937
You wanted to get into
our memories here.

17:51.037 --> 17:53.306
This is part of our memories.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.642
The belt. Dad's belt, OK?

17:55.742 --> 17:57.910
I mean, it was 30
years ago, Roseanne.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.913
Parents spanked
their kids back then.

18:01.013 --> 18:03.916
"Spanked?"

18:04.016 --> 18:04.817
Come on, Jackie.

18:04.917 --> 18:08.221
He hit us with a belt.

18:08.321 --> 18:11.057
Well, kids got hit with belts.

18:11.158 --> 18:14.994
Yeah, but did their dad strap
some great big old razor strap

18:15.094 --> 18:17.497
thing up on the wall there
right by the front door so

18:17.597 --> 18:19.932
when you came in you'd see it,
and then you'd all the time

18:20.032 --> 18:21.668
have to worry about what
was gonna happen to you

18:21.768 --> 18:22.835
if you stepped out of line?

18:22.935 --> 18:25.505
Maybe he's just
trying to psyche us out.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.641
Yeah, well, he
was good at that.

18:28.741 --> 18:31.244
Remember he'd make us go
get it and bring it to him?

18:31.344 --> 18:32.612
Well, mom wasn't
any help either.

18:32.712 --> 18:33.946
You know, she could
have said something.

18:34.046 --> 18:38.418
She'd just stay in
there washing dishes.

18:38.518 --> 18:39.352
Well, that was mom.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.953
Ignore it, and it'll go away.

18:41.053 --> 18:43.290
Yeah, she let the damn
thing hang up there,

18:43.390 --> 18:45.892
and then we're
supposed to explain

18:45.992 --> 18:48.728
why it's there to our friends.

18:48.828 --> 18:52.499
I used to tell people
it was Elvis's belt.

18:52.599 --> 18:53.900
Well, yeah.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.436
You had stupid friends.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.137
Or they were just
trying to be nice.

19:01.308 --> 19:02.709
Let's face it, Jackie.

19:02.809 --> 19:06.112
Our family was, like,
totally screwed up.

19:06.213 --> 19:08.080
Which is probably
why I got fat and why

19:08.181 --> 19:10.883
you can't have any decent
relationship with any man.

19:14.086 --> 19:18.925
Or maybe I just never
found the right guy,

19:19.025 --> 19:20.660
and you never found
the wrong donut.

19:29.436 --> 19:31.271
Well, that's probably
how we survived it all.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.972
We could always make
each other laugh.

19:33.072 --> 19:34.006
Oh, I know.

19:34.106 --> 19:34.907
Well.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.143
Well, are you sorry you came?

19:37.244 --> 19:38.110
No.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.947
No, because I think,
well, you know,

19:41.047 --> 19:43.383
we probably needed to do this.

19:46.152 --> 19:48.421
Goodbye, house.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.156
Yeah.

19:50.257 --> 19:52.592
Let's go pick up
a couple of burgers.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.860
Yeah, or sailors.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.848
So?

20:15.948 --> 20:16.749
Not bad.

20:21.521 --> 20:24.257
I divided everything
into sections--

20:24.357 --> 20:28.328
automotive, gardening,
and home repair.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.963
Wow, that's a lot better
than the animal, vegetable,

20:31.063 --> 20:32.699
mineral system you had going.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.576
Tools on the peg board?

20:43.676 --> 20:44.911
Isn't that what you wanted?

20:45.011 --> 20:45.812
It's fine.

20:47.947 --> 20:48.948
What's all this?

20:49.048 --> 20:51.017
I divided the nuts,
and bolts, and screws,

20:51.117 --> 20:53.019
and nails, and put them
all in separate jars.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.390
Is that OK?

20:57.490 --> 20:58.758
Next time, check
with me first.

21:02.862 --> 21:03.696
Well, am I done?

21:06.366 --> 21:09.068
I guess.

21:09.168 --> 21:11.037
OK, so here's the deal.

21:11.137 --> 21:12.672
You're off of grounding.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.040
And you can see David.

21:14.140 --> 21:14.974
Really?

21:15.074 --> 21:16.476
Yeah, thanks to
your Aunt Jackie.

21:16.576 --> 21:19.312
But you two are on probation.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.013
So you mess up in any
way, and he's gone.

21:21.113 --> 21:21.914
You got it?

21:22.014 --> 21:23.550
