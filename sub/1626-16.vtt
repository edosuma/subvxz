00:01.901 --> 00:06.638
Welcome to the diner
atm ribbon cutting ceremony!

00:06.640 --> 00:09.508
[hums fanfare]

00:09.510 --> 00:14.079
Everyone knows he's holding
normal-sized scissors, right?

00:14.081 --> 00:15.481
Han's just excited
that there's

00:15.483 --> 00:18.984
Something in the diner
the same size as him.

00:18.986 --> 00:20.986
Han, this is just
another waste of time,

00:20.988 --> 00:23.956
Like when you opened the diner.

00:23.958 --> 00:28.360
This machine is now
open for business!

00:31.231 --> 00:32.931
After you're done with those,

00:32.933 --> 00:37.136
I need to do a little
manscaping on my love mound.

00:37.138 --> 00:40.706
And after you're done with that,
you can throw them away.

00:40.708 --> 00:44.977
Hey, everybody!

00:44.979 --> 00:46.879
What's that yellow tape?

00:46.881 --> 00:48.847
Did someone die again?

00:48.849 --> 00:51.417
No, sophie, we got an atm.

00:51.419 --> 00:55.954
I thought we already had an atm.
"asian transgender male."

00:55.956 --> 01:00.125
Well, thank you
for saying "male."

01:00.127 --> 01:01.527
Well, move outta the way!

01:01.529 --> 01:04.263
This broad's gotta do
some bankin'!

01:04.265 --> 01:06.331
Be careful,
you're the very first.

01:06.333 --> 01:10.936
We know how long you've been
waiting to say that to a woman.

01:25.519 --> 01:28.887
No sign of deke, the cops,
or nosy white folk.

01:28.889 --> 01:29.955
Let's break in.

01:29.957 --> 01:31.490
I don't understand

01:31.492 --> 01:34.193
Why we're breaking into
your boyfriend's dumpster.

01:34.195 --> 01:38.097
The only thing I understand less
is how you pee standing up.

01:38.099 --> 01:40.766
Why? How do you pee?

01:40.768 --> 01:42.534
I am breaking up with deke,
so now's the part

01:42.536 --> 01:44.937
Of the relationship
where I sneak in his place

01:44.939 --> 01:46.371
And get my stuff out

01:46.373 --> 01:48.173
To avoid telling him
I'm breaking up with him.

01:48.175 --> 01:51.710
Well, you just cut an hour
out of every romantic comedy.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.679
You're welcome.

01:57.617 --> 02:00.052
This is the first guy
I dated that has a crank.

02:00.054 --> 02:02.921
Most of them just did crank.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.957
Okay, so here's the plan.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.325
I'm gonna climb up
on the garbage,

02:06.327 --> 02:08.127
Unsnap the windows,
dive in the dumpster,

02:08.129 --> 02:09.561
And grab his spare key
on the counter.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.230
Do you look at life
as just a game

02:11.232 --> 02:13.632
Of "set new lows
for caroline"?

02:13.634 --> 02:15.000
Why do I have to do it?

02:15.002 --> 02:17.236
I'm on parole, caroline.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.037
We're breaking into a dumpster.

02:19.039 --> 02:21.273
I don't even think
that's illegal.

02:21.275 --> 02:24.576
I didn't either.
That's why I'm on parole.

02:29.449 --> 02:34.419
Light on the right,
key on the left.

02:34.421 --> 02:37.623
We did this once after deke left
his keys at our favorite bar,

02:37.625 --> 02:39.825
Which is actually just a liquor
store where they let you drink.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.193
They turn a blind eye.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.995
Well, the guy is blind.

02:45.031 --> 02:48.033
Yeah, deke always
found cool places.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.968
Then why are you
breaking up with him?

02:49.970 --> 02:51.670
He's perfect for you.

02:51.672 --> 02:55.741
You both think living in a tuna
can is an acceptable habitat.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.276
So what if he has money?

02:57.278 --> 03:00.279
People with money
don't live in the same reality.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.814
You think donald trump would
have that hair if he were poor?

03:02.816 --> 03:05.284
Now, come on, let's get
my toothbrush and scram.

03:05.286 --> 03:09.388
You bought a toothbrush?
Oh, you really liked him.

03:09.390 --> 03:12.658
Wait, max, is that
one of your gnomes?

03:12.660 --> 03:15.194
Oh, my god, you were
practically moving in!

03:15.196 --> 03:17.429
[gasps]
and it's your favorite one,

03:17.431 --> 03:19.264
Gnome-o-sexual!

03:19.266 --> 03:21.967
No, this is my second-favorite.

03:21.969 --> 03:24.503
My favorite
is "gnome more drama."

03:24.505 --> 03:27.906
And he's not here because
he don't want no more drama,

03:27.908 --> 03:31.743
And frankly, neither do I.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.278
Come on, let's go.

03:33.280 --> 03:38.083
You don't have to ask me twice
to get out of a dumpster.

03:39.118 --> 03:40.152
Well, well.

03:40.154 --> 03:42.454
If it isn't max-a-million.

03:42.456 --> 03:45.357
Or should I say,
"max who hates my millions"?

03:45.359 --> 03:48.160
Shouldn't you be occupying
wall street or something?

03:48.162 --> 03:49.861
I am just here
for my toothbrush,

03:49.863 --> 03:52.297
And then I'll leave you
in your ivory dumpster

03:52.299 --> 03:55.334
To sit around
and fart diamonds.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.336
So don't get the wrong idea,
uncle pennybags.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.504
I'm not here to be
aunt pennybags.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.607
Max, who's uncle pennybags?

04:01.609 --> 04:04.810
Is he one of the ones
who touched you?

04:04.812 --> 04:07.646
Both: He's the monopoly man.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.915
See? You guys are perfect
for each other.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.483
Yeah, max.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.986
We're like a more awesome
version of john and yoko.

04:13.988 --> 04:16.388
Meaning, like, just john.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.991
Who cares if I got
a few million dollars?

04:18.993 --> 04:20.626
A hundred few million.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.829
And that's on the low end,
according to bing.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.998
Well, I'll be by later, deke.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.266
Come on, caroline.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.534
No, max, you won't.

04:29.536 --> 04:31.870
You're taking your stuff 'cause
you're breaking up with me

04:31.872 --> 04:33.472
And you're too big a baby pants

04:33.474 --> 04:35.240
To tell me you're
breaking up with me.

04:35.242 --> 04:37.175
Pfffttt!
What?

04:37.177 --> 04:39.978
I am not breaking up
with you.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.513
I just needed my toothbrush

04:41.515 --> 04:43.382
Because I had
dollar shrimp for lunch

04:43.384 --> 04:46.518
And I still have
some shells in my teeth.

04:46.520 --> 04:50.455
I will see you later tonight
for sex and various whatnots.

04:50.457 --> 04:53.091
I am not breaking up with you.

04:53.093 --> 04:56.862
That breakup was brutal!

05:01.167 --> 05:05.504
Yo, max, I hear our boy deke
got major money.

05:05.506 --> 05:10.709
I shoulda known, 'cause the weed
he gave me was real quality.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.146
And free.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.615
Earl, money changes people.
I know.

05:16.617 --> 05:21.186
Every time the food stamps came,
my mother was all, "max who?"

05:22.188 --> 05:26.925
'ello, my good people!

05:26.927 --> 05:29.661
You are quite fortunate today,

05:29.663 --> 05:33.498
For a rich person has come
to dine in your establishment!

05:35.034 --> 05:36.368
Caroline, I would like

05:36.370 --> 05:38.437
A tabletop
in max's section, please.

05:38.439 --> 05:39.971
Because it's high time she met

05:39.973 --> 05:42.674
The person I've been
pretending not to be.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.344
The veil has been lifted.
She was correct.

05:45.346 --> 05:50.148
I am the monopoly man.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.650
Right this way, sir.

05:51.652 --> 05:55.721
I believe I have a table here
in the overacting section.

05:55.723 --> 05:59.791
All right, I'll give it up.
You got me laughing.

06:01.494 --> 06:04.196
And I would miss all this
if we didn't hang out,

06:04.198 --> 06:05.997
So I guess we can still be
friends

06:05.999 --> 06:07.566
And pastry school partners.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.668
[scoffs]
pastry school partners?

06:09.670 --> 06:13.405
Your breasts
are named in my will.

06:15.007 --> 06:17.743
Come on, you can't be
serious about this.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.378
Don't worry,
we can still do all the stuff

06:19.380 --> 06:21.146
We had planned for our future.

06:21.148 --> 06:24.449
Like tping han's apartment
on the 14th--I'm not a monster.

06:24.451 --> 06:27.185
Max--
deke, you can't
be my boyfriend.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.653
From now on I'm like welfare.

06:28.655 --> 06:32.257
You have to be broke
to get some.

06:38.164 --> 06:40.098
Max, I really wish
you'd reconsider

06:40.100 --> 06:41.967
Breaking up with deke.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.035
I mean, you guys
get along great.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.338
He lives in a trash can,

06:46.340 --> 06:50.208
He shares your love
of pee-pee jokes.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.544
He can hide things
in his hair.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.446
Aren't those the things
you didn't like about him

06:54.448 --> 06:56.181
Before you knew
he had money?

06:56.183 --> 06:58.216
Yes, but people can change.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.252
So change and like him.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.354
Come on,
just keep an open mind.

07:02.356 --> 07:03.989
In fact, why don't
you sleep on it?

07:03.991 --> 07:07.426
Right now. Go. Go to bed.
Go, go, go, go, go.

07:07.428 --> 07:11.997
Boy, are you eager
to masturbate.

07:16.836 --> 07:18.303
Hey, friend.

07:18.305 --> 07:21.072
Come on, get in.

07:21.074 --> 07:24.709
I told you I can't
see that anymore.
Why?

07:24.711 --> 07:26.978
You're my friend,
he's my friend.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.980
We're all just friends.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.515
Where did you get a key?

07:30.517 --> 07:32.217
Don't be mad.
I asked her for help.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.752
Caroline, get in here!

07:33.754 --> 07:38.356
<i>(caroline)</i>
<i>can't. I'm masturbating!</i>

07:38.358 --> 07:40.759
Caroline, what are you doing?

07:40.761 --> 07:42.594
Are those new shoes?

07:42.596 --> 07:45.564
Uh, yes.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.432
Where did they come from?

07:47.434 --> 07:50.168
They were just here.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.070
In your size?

07:52.072 --> 07:54.906
It's a miracle.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.842
They're from me.

07:56.844 --> 07:59.478
I got 'em for her
as a gift.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.247
What makes you think
you could buy my roommate?

08:02.249 --> 08:06.051
She said, "I'll give you the key
if you buy me new shoes."

08:06.053 --> 08:09.087
Ha! For love!

08:09.089 --> 08:12.324
I did it for love!

08:12.326 --> 08:14.025
You two belong together.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.427
Like me and these shoes.

08:15.429 --> 08:17.596
Come on, just give me
a chance to express

08:17.598 --> 08:19.598
My deep feelings
about this.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.833
Max, what I'm trying
to say is...

08:21.835 --> 08:24.769
Pfffftttt!

08:24.771 --> 08:28.273
I don't wanna be your friend.
I wanna be your boyfriend.

08:28.275 --> 08:32.611
Well, right now it looks like
you want to be my girlfriend.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.479
Maybe I can help
clear things up.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.448
How much is this
gonna cost me?

08:36.450 --> 08:38.149
Nothing. Look...

08:38.151 --> 08:41.586
Max doesn't think she deserves
someone rich because she has...

08:41.588 --> 08:43.655
Well, low self-esteem.

08:43.657 --> 08:48.026
Wrong.
I have no self-esteem.

08:48.028 --> 08:53.231
And I can see
the bottom of your balls.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.267
Max, remember two days ago

08:55.269 --> 08:58.203
When you loved
the bottom of my balls?

08:58.205 --> 09:02.474
That's when they were poor
and I felt sorry for them.

09:03.809 --> 09:05.644
Come on,
you two belong together.

09:05.646 --> 09:09.114
You're like the romeo and juliet
of ball banter.

09:09.116 --> 09:11.016
I'm sorry,
it's just never gonna work.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.552
It's like we were raised with
different religions, like...

09:13.554 --> 09:15.921
What are two religions?

09:15.923 --> 09:18.957
Are you taking suggestions
from the audience,

09:18.959 --> 09:22.694
Or do you really not know
the names of two religions?

09:22.696 --> 09:27.165
Let's say...
A witch and a smurf.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.935
Question answered.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.938
So it's like I'm a witch
and you're a smurf.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.307
We could never be together.
Everybody knows that.

09:35.309 --> 09:37.642
I've only lived like a witch.
I've never lived like a smurf.

09:37.644 --> 09:38.977
So I don't get you.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.946
What's it like
being blue and soft?

09:40.948 --> 09:43.582
I don't know, I'm a witch.
I'm green and all-powerful.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.750
So you're saying
you can't relate to me

09:45.752 --> 09:48.486
Because you've
never been a smurf?

09:48.488 --> 09:50.288
Wow. That's heavy.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.856
Well, I'm gonna go.

09:51.858 --> 09:56.561
Oh, I better take off this
silly robe and put on my skirt.

09:56.563 --> 09:59.598
And she's giving back
the shoes.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.535
Oh, no, she is not!

10:10.242 --> 10:13.545
"language preference: English,
spanish, chinese, french."

10:13.547 --> 10:16.314
[chuckles] they should've made
this more specific to the diner.

10:16.316 --> 10:19.784
"hipster, hobo, junkie,
pregnant teen."

10:19.786 --> 10:23.121
Don't forget
"ballerina with a head wound."

10:23.123 --> 10:26.124
"would you like to see
your account balance?"

10:26.126 --> 10:29.127
That atm's a real bitch.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.430
Yeah, I got a hot 17 in here
that's dying to get out.

10:32.432 --> 10:36.735
So did oleg when that cop
pulled him over.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.236
Caroline,
look at this receipt.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.638
This can't be right.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.839
I haven't seen this many
zeros in one place

10:40.841 --> 10:43.208
Since the diner
christmas party.

10:43.210 --> 10:46.211
That says $1,000,017.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.213
Han, your atm's broken.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.181
It just gave max $1 million.

10:50.183 --> 10:53.685
Out of my way! Out of my way!
Out of my way!

10:55.921 --> 10:59.591
This is it--the faulty atm
that gives out millions.

10:59.593 --> 11:04.396
I thought it was
an urban legend like hpv.

11:04.398 --> 11:06.498
Everybody freeze.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.233
The damn thing must be busted.

11:08.235 --> 11:11.036
And to think I bent over
backwards to get that atm.

11:11.038 --> 11:14.706
Well, I bent over forwards
to get a "b" in spanish.

11:16.042 --> 11:19.010
Damn it. My account's
exactly the same.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.879
Frozen.

11:20.881 --> 11:24.349
So, deke left this note
for you earlier.

11:24.351 --> 11:28.787
I forgot 'cause I'm 120.

11:28.789 --> 11:33.291
Now you know what it's like
to be a smurf.

11:33.293 --> 11:37.862
Can you believe this?
Deke gave me $1 million!

11:43.169 --> 11:47.572
[strained]
so that's real money?

11:47.574 --> 11:51.543
The money's real?

11:51.545 --> 11:54.312
You have $1 million?

11:54.314 --> 11:57.015
We're a millionaire?

12:02.054 --> 12:04.155
[elevator dings]

12:04.157 --> 12:06.424
Oh, good morning,
my good man.

12:06.426 --> 12:11.029
I recently came into some money,
thus the candy tiara.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.363
And I wanted to
spread the wealth.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.199
Here.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.734
Have a pound of coffee.

12:15.736 --> 12:19.070
It's folgers,
since I'm a millionaire now.

12:19.072 --> 12:24.042
Best part of waking up rich!

12:24.044 --> 12:28.213
I come bearing gifts
for all my best friends.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.915
Here, guy who stands
behind me...

12:30.917 --> 12:34.452
A 12-pack of
triple-a batteries for you.

12:34.454 --> 12:37.722
And yes, they did have to
open the glass case at cvs

12:37.724 --> 12:40.225
For me to get these.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.827
Here,
lady on the other side.

12:42.829 --> 12:46.297
A shampoo <i>and</i> conditioner!

12:46.299 --> 12:50.201
Herbal essences,
no big deal.

12:50.203 --> 12:54.739
And don't think I forgot
about you, peek-a-boo hair.

12:54.741 --> 12:57.442
A godiva box of chocolates.

12:57.444 --> 13:01.613
No, you're not dreaming.
I said "godiva"!

13:01.615 --> 13:04.215
Max, I have great news.

13:04.217 --> 13:07.385
And you, woman who
sold me out for shoes.

13:07.387 --> 13:10.121
I got you something very special
when I was out gift shopping.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.723
You know how you always say,

13:11.725 --> 13:14.726
"who do I have to bang to get
a chip clip around here?"

13:14.728 --> 13:16.661
Me!

13:16.663 --> 13:19.130
Wait, you spent money?

13:19.132 --> 13:21.466
How much of our million
did you spend on your...

13:21.468 --> 13:23.835
We'll call it
a shopping spree.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.770
Almost all of it.

13:25.772 --> 13:29.374
$143!

13:29.376 --> 13:32.443
Okay, our public schools
have failed you.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.646
Or they would have
if you'd went.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.748
But I'm too excited to care.

13:36.750 --> 13:39.350
First things first.
When do we quit the diner?

13:39.352 --> 13:41.119
What are you talking about?
We're not quitting the diner.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.921
I'm giving the rest
of the money back.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.989
Hold on, hold on,
pump the brakes.

13:44.991 --> 13:48.526
What's the problem?
You got a chip clip--you're set.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.528
I only spent it
to make a point to deke.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.565
You can't give it back.
I have plans. Big plans.

13:53.567 --> 13:54.999
After we quit the diner,

13:55.001 --> 13:58.203
I found a guy who can turn
that measly million into 3.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.205
And don't worry,
he was not named

14:00.207 --> 14:01.573
In my father's ponzi
scheme.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.741
Well, not by the name
he goes by now.

14:03.743 --> 14:07.645
What up, smurfette?

14:07.647 --> 14:08.780
Oh, hello, deke.

14:08.782 --> 14:10.114
You just missed me passing out

14:10.116 --> 14:11.649
All the gifts I bought
with your million,

14:11.651 --> 14:13.051
But you're here
in time to see me

14:13.053 --> 14:14.953
Buy big mary as my lab partner.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.622
Who says I'm for sale?

14:17.624 --> 14:21.559
A fireman's calendar...

14:21.561 --> 14:24.762
And another
fireman's calendar.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.598
Sold.

14:29.468 --> 14:31.970
I bet you didn't think
I'd spend that money, hmm?

14:31.972 --> 14:34.072
Well, you were wrong.

14:34.074 --> 14:37.542
I spent $143!

14:37.544 --> 14:39.611
Max, I wanted you
to spend the money

14:39.613 --> 14:41.312
So you know
what it's like to be rich.

14:41.314 --> 14:42.847
<i>Now we're both smurfs.</i>

14:42.849 --> 14:44.482
You can relate to me again.

14:44.484 --> 14:49.287
Wanna go do hand stuff by the
ovens like we did last Tuesday?

14:49.289 --> 14:52.590
Oh, so you were just trying
to buy me with the money?

14:52.592 --> 14:55.193
Well, I'm not
a high-priced call girl.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.795
'cause super bowl
weekend's over.

14:57.797 --> 15:00.398
Here. I'm giving you
the rest of the money back.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.666
Okay...

15:01.668 --> 15:04.068
Obviously, she is not
mentally competent enough

15:04.070 --> 15:05.670
To handle her finances.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.772
This is like when my grandma
wanted to give all her money

15:07.774 --> 15:11.576
To that orphanage, so they had
her diagnosed with alzheimer's.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.211
Here.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.280
I can't believe I'm losing
all of my money

15:15.282 --> 15:17.582
Twice in one lifetime.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.851
[strained]
who has an inhaler?

15:22.588 --> 15:24.489
And check it.
I even put your name on there.

15:24.491 --> 15:28.426
"deke mc-richy mc-never-
had-to-work-for-anything"?

15:28.428 --> 15:29.827
Oh, sorry, I probably
should've added,

15:29.829 --> 15:32.830
"richy rich
pretended-he-was-poor-instein"

15:32.832 --> 15:34.332
So they'd know it's you.

15:34.334 --> 15:37.268
Here, I'll fix it.

15:37.270 --> 15:41.306
Oh, yes.
I treat myself well.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.041
You know what, max?
Stop.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.909
I've tried everything
to show you I'm not

15:44.911 --> 15:47.345
Some cartoon rich guy,
and you still think I'm a joke.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.580
You only see me as my money,
but I'm not.

15:49.582 --> 15:52.250
That's how much money
means to me.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.484
But you were right.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.687
It's not gonna work with us.

16:03.362 --> 16:06.998
Max. Oh, I got your gift.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.501
I love my new vibrator.

16:12.638 --> 16:17.008
It's not a vibrator, sophie.
It's a dustbuster.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.676
Oh.

16:18.678 --> 16:23.014
Well, there's
no dust there anymore.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.183
I'll be in my booth.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.719
Waitress. Waitress.

16:27.721 --> 16:30.355
"waitress"?
Who's she talking to?

16:31.924 --> 16:33.124
Miss...

16:33.126 --> 16:34.625
This salmon
tastes like chicken.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.861
That's weird,
'cause it's pork.

16:36.863 --> 16:39.764
I don't need attitude
from some waitress.

16:39.766 --> 16:43.501
Who is this waitress
you keep referring to?

16:43.503 --> 16:46.404
Your job is to take my order,

16:46.406 --> 16:48.940
Put a smile on your face,
and serve me.

16:48.942 --> 16:52.643
Oh, hell, no!

16:54.113 --> 16:56.180
I don't have to take this.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.950
Let me show you
something, doll.

16:58.952 --> 17:02.787
This is my receipt from
the last time I used the atm.

17:02.789 --> 17:05.089
You see where it says "account
balance" at the bottom there?

17:05.091 --> 17:06.724
Read that number to me,
please.

17:06.726 --> 17:10.628
If you have $1 million,
why would you be working here?

17:10.630 --> 17:12.597
Good question.

17:14.166 --> 17:15.833
Hey.

17:15.835 --> 17:20.805
You seem cranky.
You want to use my dustbuster?

17:23.742 --> 17:25.309
That woman just asked me

17:25.311 --> 17:28.346
If I have $1 million,
why am I working here?

17:28.348 --> 17:30.014
That's what I've been saying.

17:30.016 --> 17:32.116
I mean, I have $1 million.

17:32.118 --> 17:33.751
That's what I've been saying.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.653
I don't need to be
in this dump!

17:35.655 --> 17:37.155
Again, that's what I've--

17:37.157 --> 17:39.090
You've been saying!
I know, I'm an idiot!

17:39.092 --> 17:40.458
I'm keeping that money!

17:40.460 --> 17:42.060
That's what I've been saying!

17:42.062 --> 17:43.728
Max, caroline--
no.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.530
You don't even know
what I was about to say.

17:45.532 --> 17:48.199
Whatever it is, no.
We have $1 million.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.767
Yeah, we have $1 million.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.837
Yeah, we have $1 million,
and I quit!

17:52.839 --> 17:54.605
And I quit too, baby!

17:54.607 --> 17:56.941
I have hated this hellhole
from day one.

17:56.943 --> 17:59.844
Sayonara, short stuff!

18:01.080 --> 18:03.014
I don't know what's
more offensive.

18:03.016 --> 18:05.116
"sayonara" or "short stuff"!

18:05.118 --> 18:07.952
I would go with "sayonara,"
short stuff.

18:10.722 --> 18:11.856
Wow.

18:14.626 --> 18:15.893
That got off quicker than

18:15.895 --> 18:17.795
A 12-year-old
looking at megan fox.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.797
Quick? I've been trying
to get out of this thing

18:19.799 --> 18:20.998
For three years.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.068
This zipper is stuck!
This is like a horror movie!

18:24.070 --> 18:25.837
Help me!
Get this damn thing off me!

18:25.839 --> 18:28.106
Tear it off, cut it off,
light it on fire!

18:28.108 --> 18:29.307
Well, watch my hair.

18:29.309 --> 18:30.374
Oh, who cares!
I'll buy new hair!

18:30.376 --> 18:31.976
[both laugh]

18:31.978 --> 18:33.311
Damn it, I'll just go over.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.812
Yes! We're out of here.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.981
No more diner,
no more cupcakes.

18:36.983 --> 18:39.217
Wait, wait,
no more cupcakes?

18:39.219 --> 18:40.785
What are you talking about?

18:40.787 --> 18:42.820
With all this money,
we can grow our business.

18:42.822 --> 18:45.123
Oh, I'm not growing
anything

18:45.125 --> 18:48.993
Except a big-ass weed plant
on my nightstand.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.561
But it's our dream.

18:50.563 --> 18:53.564
I don't need a dream.
Dreams are for poor people!

18:53.566 --> 18:54.932
I have $1 million.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.634
I'm not going
to pastry school,

18:56.636 --> 18:58.503
I might not even
go to the bathroom.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.838
And I am definitely not
getting out of bed.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.574
I will never
do anything again!

19:04.943 --> 19:08.012
Oh, my god, I'll never
do anything again.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.981
We're not quitting.

19:12.184 --> 19:14.218
[strained]
I knew it!

19:14.220 --> 19:18.089
Between you and this zipper,
I'll never get outta here.

19:18.091 --> 19:21.025
I can't. You heard what I'd
be like with $1 million.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.493
I'd be dead at 30.

19:22.495 --> 19:26.797
But isn't that what
you've always wanted?

19:29.268 --> 19:30.501
[knocks]

19:30.503 --> 19:32.603
Hey, uncle pennybags,
you home?

19:32.605 --> 19:34.906
I mean, you dumpster?

19:34.908 --> 19:37.008
Hey, can I come in?

19:37.010 --> 19:39.777
Or did you already move on?
'cause I'd get it if you did.

19:39.779 --> 19:44.615
Nah, come in. Just sittin'
in here fartin' diamonds.

19:44.617 --> 19:48.653
Look, I think
I owe you an apology.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.922
You know how I called you
a lazy mc-richy rich who never

19:50.924 --> 19:53.791
Had to work for anything
and lives in an ivory dumpster?

19:53.793 --> 19:56.527
Is this part of the apology

19:56.529 --> 19:59.430
Or just the recap of mean things
you've said to me?

19:59.432 --> 20:01.699
Just listen.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.235
Well, I was right, you never did
have to work for anything.

20:04.237 --> 20:07.638
Okay, I'm starting to think you
don't know what an apology is.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.808
But even though you never
had to work for anything,

20:10.810 --> 20:11.943
You do.

20:11.945 --> 20:14.412
You actually get up,
you go to pastry school,

20:14.414 --> 20:16.847
And you build dumpsters,
you do lots of stuff.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.549
Hey, you're not even
familiar with my charity:

20:18.551 --> 20:21.118
Orgasms for old people.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.788
I hope you're not joking.

20:23.790 --> 20:27.191
Look, the truth is
I couldn't see past your money.

20:27.193 --> 20:28.793
All I saw was smurf.

20:28.795 --> 20:32.530
And I thought witches and smurfs
couldn't be together,

20:32.532 --> 20:35.833
But I was wrong.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.535
Yeah, you were.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.304
Max, did you get back
the check yet?

20:40.306 --> 20:42.573
Because I just found
a different investment guy.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.141
A legit one in germany.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.344
His name is herr schluffen.

20:46.346 --> 20:49.714
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm giving it back right now.

20:49.716 --> 20:52.450
Herr schluffen
can schluff off.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.086
Wait, max,
can I hold the million?

20:55.088 --> 20:59.824
For just one more second,
I want to be upper-middle class.

21:02.527 --> 21:05.096
<i>(max)</i>
<i>caroline, give it back.</i>
