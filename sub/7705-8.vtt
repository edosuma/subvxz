WEBVTT

00:02.436 --> 00:05.704
Here you go, Brian,
bring the plates.

00:05.706 --> 00:08.140
[burps]

00:08.142 --> 00:09.541
Nice meal, Kate.

00:09.543 --> 00:12.544
Even though the portions
were extremely small.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.913
Sorry, we only had
one pot roast.

00:16.384 --> 00:19.151
Guess what? The most exciting
thing just happened.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.220
Scott Maynard wants
to keep all of his

00:21.222 --> 00:23.055
band equipment in our garage.

00:23.057 --> 00:26.892
- Goodness, that is exciting.
- Who is Scott?

00:26.894 --> 00:29.061
He's that guy
I told you about from school.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.163
New boyfriend, huh?

00:31.165 --> 00:33.699
- Not yet.
- Boyfriend?

00:33.701 --> 00:36.402
You should see him,
he's gorgeous.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.237
Better-looking than me?

00:38.239 --> 00:40.572
Well, he's different.

00:40.574 --> 00:44.910
He has darker hair.
And less of it.

00:44.912 --> 00:45.978
I see.

00:45.980 --> 00:47.813
Anyway, dad, he's got this
rock band

00:47.815 --> 00:49.982
and they keep their instruments
and stuff in his garage

00:49.984 --> 00:52.084
but Scott's dad's having
this garage sale tomorrow

00:52.086 --> 00:53.585
and he said that
if Scott doesn't get

00:53.587 --> 00:54.987
all of his stuff
out of there tonight

00:54.989 --> 00:57.423
he'll sell it off for $5,
so is it okay?

00:57.425 --> 00:59.758
Is what okay?
I missed most of that.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.494
Please, dad,
he wants to come over tonight.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.596
- Tonight?
- Yeah, tonight.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.665
In about 15 minutes,
if dad says yes.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.600
I thought we had a date.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.736
You and Lynn have a date?

01:10.738 --> 01:12.871
We're gonna redecorate my room.

01:12.873 --> 01:16.375
I'm sorry, ALF, we'll have
to redecorate another time.

01:16.377 --> 01:17.709
I see.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.745
Mom, can I borrow
your pink sweater?

01:19.747 --> 01:21.380
Your father hasn't
said yes yet.

01:21.382 --> 01:25.284
Dad, Scott could have called
anybody in school about this

01:25.286 --> 01:26.952
but he chose me.

01:26.954 --> 01:28.153
I see.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.457
Please, dad,
it's just for two days.

01:31.459 --> 01:34.359
I suppose Scott can keep
his instruments here.

01:34.361 --> 01:35.427
Thanks, dad.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.062
- Mom.
- Yes.

01:37.064 --> 01:40.132
- You can use the pink sweater.
- Thanks.

01:40.134 --> 01:43.635
Well, guess it's just me
and my swatches.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.471
Remember the decorating rules.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.739
The decorating consists
of a couple of posters

01:47.741 --> 01:49.074
maybe a coat of paint.

01:49.076 --> 01:50.442
Boy, you would've been
a lot of fun

01:50.444 --> 01:52.144
during the Renaissances.

01:52.146 --> 01:54.880
[theme music]

02:29.316 --> 02:32.084
[music continues]

02:55.176 --> 02:57.276
[instrumental music]

02:59.547 --> 03:00.712
How many more trips?

03:00.714 --> 03:02.281
Just a couple of more.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.816
I really appreciate this,
everybody in the band does.

03:04.818 --> 03:08.353
Well, if you invite me
to the next G-Men's show

03:08.355 --> 03:09.388
we'll call it even.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.889
Oh, we're not the G-Men anymore.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.392
Some other band had that name,
so we changed it.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.627
[grunts]
See.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.997
Um, wasn't there already
a band called The Doors?

03:18.999 --> 03:21.833
You're kidding, there was?

03:21.835 --> 03:24.570
Oh, but that's okay,
there's probably nobody alive

03:24.572 --> 03:26.972
who still remembers them.

03:29.076 --> 03:32.911
So, how come a cute girl like
you isn't out on Friday night?

03:32.913 --> 03:36.648
Oh, I am...usually but..

03:36.650 --> 03:40.252
...uh, you know,
sometimes I like to..

03:40.254 --> 03:44.423
...stay home and,
you know, see my family.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.892
Oh, I'm sorry I'm taking up
your time with your family--

03:46.894 --> 03:49.061
No, no, I saw them.

03:52.233 --> 03:55.167
- Listen, Lynn--
- ALF.

03:55.169 --> 04:00.606
- What?
- Uh...nothing just...ALF.

04:00.608 --> 04:03.775
Oh. Well, anyway,
I was gonna say

04:03.777 --> 04:05.244
there's a basketball game
tomorrow night

04:05.246 --> 04:07.312
and I was wondering
if you'd wanna go with me?

04:08.882 --> 04:10.716
- Me?
- You don't have to say yes.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.117
I mean,
it's kind of short notice.

04:12.119 --> 04:13.785
No!

04:13.787 --> 04:17.723
- What?
- No, I mean, yes.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.725
That sounds like fun.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.360
Great. How about 7 o'clock?

04:23.264 --> 04:28.200
- What's wrong?
- Uh, nothing, just a locust.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.138
Alright, here, put this up.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.949
What are you guys doing?

04:43.951 --> 04:46.318
Wallpapering the screens.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.921
Wallpapering the screens
is<i> not</i> redecorating.

04:49.923 --> 04:52.291
It's a matter of taste.

04:52.293 --> 04:55.761
Take that down
and throw it away.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.130
There you go,
take it right down

04:58.132 --> 05:00.499
take it outside
and throw it away.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.501
Yes, mom.

05:02.503 --> 05:05.504
Kate, I need some advice.

05:05.506 --> 05:09.441
Here is some advice.
Don't ever do this again.

05:09.443 --> 05:12.311
No, no, I need some
advice about women.

05:12.313 --> 05:16.114
Women, don't go for this
kind of thing.

05:16.116 --> 05:19.351
I got the message.
I was wrong, kill me.

05:20.688 --> 05:24.122
[sighs]
Okay, ALF, what is it ?

05:24.124 --> 05:26.458
I'm asking you this,
Kate, because..

05:26.460 --> 05:29.261
...you are a beautiful woman.

05:29.263 --> 05:32.497
I mean that.
I really do.

05:32.499 --> 05:37.135
Well, I-I don't know if I think
of myself quite like that but..

05:37.137 --> 05:41.039
Aah, beautiful,
and modest too.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.175
What is it that
you wanna know?

05:43.177 --> 05:45.477
Like, let's say
a certain friend

05:45.479 --> 05:49.881
was attracted to
a certain beautiful woman.

05:49.883 --> 05:53.285
Are you still writing
letters to Connie Chung?

05:53.287 --> 05:57.222
No, it's someone
a lot closer than that.

05:57.224 --> 06:00.826
Actually, it's someone
in this house.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.294
Oh!

06:03.997 --> 06:08.800
And, um, you wanna
know how to win her over.

06:08.802 --> 06:12.571
Yeah. I mean,
let's dip into your past.

06:12.573 --> 06:15.741
What did Willie do
to sweep you off your feet?

06:15.743 --> 06:18.076
Let-let me see.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.212
[chuckles]
Yeah, um..

06:20.214 --> 06:22.814
We had been going together
four or five months

06:22.816 --> 06:28.220
and, uh, this one day we were
talking about food or something

06:28.222 --> 06:32.357
and, um, I mentioned that
I liked cream of mushroom soup.

06:32.359 --> 06:36.094
So, uh, uh, the next day
I go to my car

06:36.096 --> 06:39.898
and inside are 500 cans

06:39.900 --> 06:42.434
of cream of mushroom soup.

06:42.436 --> 06:45.203
So you're saying I should do
something pathetic.

06:45.205 --> 06:49.875
It wasn't pathetic,
it was...romantic.

06:49.877 --> 06:52.177
What would you suggest
other than soup?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.914
Oh, I, uh, I don't know, um..

06:55.916 --> 06:58.917
Flowers, uh, candy, uh..

06:58.919 --> 07:01.787
How about a poem?
I mean that's personal.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.622
I.. A-a women would love it.

07:03.624 --> 07:08.093
And, uh it doesn't involve
wallpaper or glue.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.962
A poem? That's perfect!

07:10.964 --> 07:13.765
I was somewhat of a bard
on Melmac, you know?

07:13.767 --> 07:15.567
Oh, you've written poems?

07:15.569 --> 07:17.202
Ever hear of this one?

07:17.204 --> 07:22.240
Jason, Jason, he's our man,
if he can't do it, nobody can.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.976
Oh, I thought that was Keats.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.745
I'll start now.

07:26.747 --> 07:29.881
There once was
a young man from Venus--

07:29.883 --> 07:31.216
ALF.

07:35.489 --> 07:38.223
- ALF.
- What?

07:38.225 --> 07:43.662
I thought the rule was you would
ask before you use my tools.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.465
Sorry. May I?

07:46.467 --> 07:49.668
- Yes, you may.
- See, you're still in charge.

07:51.505 --> 07:54.506
[clears throat]
What do you need
the tools for anyway?

07:54.508 --> 07:57.342
I'm tryin' to fix
Scott's piano.

07:57.344 --> 08:01.179
He must have broken it
when he dragged it in here.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.915
ALF, you have
to turn it on.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.419
Oh.

08:07.421 --> 08:10.322
Didn't you learn about
electronic music on Melmac?

08:10.324 --> 08:13.692
Ancient history wasn't
my best subject.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.193
What are you doing here anyway?

08:15.195 --> 08:19.331
Well...I wrote a poem
for someone and, uh..

08:19.333 --> 08:21.433
...I wanna put it to music.

08:21.435 --> 08:24.269
Well, as you may,
or may not know

08:24.271 --> 08:27.706
many people think
<i> I</i> am musically inclined.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.708
Name three?

08:29.710 --> 08:31.943
I don't think
I have to name names.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.447
May I see the poem?

08:38.952 --> 08:41.620
"Take a look at me
and tell me what you see

08:41.622 --> 08:44.456
just another pretty face."

08:44.458 --> 08:46.057
It's very amusing.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.826
Then there's the chorus.

08:47.828 --> 08:51.496
"I can't get
no satisfaction."

08:51.498 --> 08:53.999
Shouldn't that be I can't
get any satisfaction?

08:54.001 --> 08:56.368
Forget it,
that's an old draft.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.206
Now, let's wail.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.075
Aiming something
in the key of D.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.545
Uh, may I suggest
the key of E flat?

09:06.547 --> 09:08.146
It's more euphonious.

09:09.216 --> 09:12.918
Great. We need
more euphoniousness.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.586
[piano music]

09:14.588 --> 09:18.823
¶ Take a look at me
and tell me what you see ¶

09:18.825 --> 09:23.528
¶ Just another pretty face ¶¶

09:23.530 --> 09:25.363
- That's nice, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

09:25.365 --> 09:28.700
- Yeah, it's the lovely.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

09:28.702 --> 09:32.170
Feel free to use that.
I don't need any credit.

09:32.172 --> 09:35.340
[Willie humming]

09:37.077 --> 09:39.611
I'll call ya if I ever
audition for Hee-Haw.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.182
[piano music]

09:48.121 --> 09:50.488
Yeah, now we're cookin'.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.092
[saxophone music]

09:57.297 --> 09:58.797
- Brian in bed.
- Mmh.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.699
He didn't even wake up
when I took off his shoes.

10:00.701 --> 10:04.636
Mmm, so nice to have
a quiet moment.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.471
I thought Lynn will
be home before now.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.640
Hmm, the game might've
gone into overtime.

10:08.642 --> 10:09.741
[telephone rings]

10:09.743 --> 10:11.042
Oh, maybe that's her.

10:12.412 --> 10:15.547
Hello. Oh, hello,
Mrs. Ochmonek.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.217
Oh, what loud rock music?

10:19.219 --> 10:21.319
'From our garage?'

10:21.321 --> 10:23.421
I'll make sure
that he doesn't do it again.

10:23.423 --> 10:26.458
Uh, Brian I mean, uh, I'll make
sure that he doesn't play

10:26.460 --> 10:29.628
his, uh, his electric guitar,
right, uh

10:29.630 --> 10:31.396
too loudly, uh..

10:31.398 --> 10:34.466
...or his saxophone..

10:34.468 --> 10:36.835
...or his drums.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.303
Uh, goodnight, Mrs. Ochmonek.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.773
Well, I have a good guess,
but you go first.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.909
Well, when I left ALF
was writing a song

10:44.911 --> 10:47.812
I think it might have grown.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.314
A song?

10:49.316 --> 10:50.649
- Oh, no.
- What?

10:50.651 --> 10:54.586
Willie, I think that ALF
wrote that song for me.

10:54.588 --> 10:56.421
For you?

10:56.423 --> 10:58.356
I might as well tell you this.

10:58.358 --> 11:01.026
ALF has a crush on me.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.361
[laughing]

11:04.698 --> 11:07.032
That's not the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.034
[laughing]
No, no. Uh, no.

11:09.036 --> 11:12.671
I'm sorry, no.
Of course it's not. No.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.372
[laughing]

11:15.776 --> 11:17.575
Let's just drop it, okay?

11:20.514 --> 11:22.380
Beside, I actually,
I know someone

11:22.382 --> 11:25.283
who does have a crush on you,
uh, actually, it's not a crush

11:25.285 --> 11:28.153
it's, it's quite serious.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.221
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.323
- And do you know something?
- What?

11:32.325 --> 11:34.492
Um, ALF's in the garage..

11:34.494 --> 11:37.862
...and, uh, Lynn is gone,
Brain's asleep..

11:38.899 --> 11:40.732
We're, uh..

11:40.734 --> 11:42.734
...we're all alone.

11:42.736 --> 11:46.404
I'm not sure I remember
what this is like.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.639
Well..

11:48.709 --> 11:50.775
M-may I remind you?

11:52.245 --> 11:53.912
- Willie.
- Yes.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.447
I'll wear the red pajamas.

11:57.384 --> 12:01.419
No, a-are you sure that
ALF is in the garage?

12:01.421 --> 12:05.223
Let's just for a moment
not think about ALF.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.927
Let say to ourselves
there is no ALF.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.762
There is no ALF.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.765
Go for it, Willie.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.768
Yeah!

12:18.772 --> 12:21.272
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for Lynn.

12:21.274 --> 12:24.209
She's still out with Scott.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.444
I see.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.280
ALF, we've had complaints
from the neighbors.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.882
Well, I'm not surprised.

12:30.884 --> 12:34.119
She's setting a bad example
for all the other daughters.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.054
How's the song coming?

12:36.056 --> 12:37.889
It's not just a song.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.125
It's a rock video.

12:40.127 --> 12:43.228
ALF, you made
a rock video.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.363
Yeah, and it wasn't
easy either.

12:45.365 --> 12:48.466
That equipment of yours is
hardly state of the art.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.869
Willie, he made
a rock video.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.470
Yeah, for Lynn.

12:52.472 --> 12:57.041
You..
You made it...f-for Lynn?

12:57.043 --> 12:58.643
Yeah.

12:59.646 --> 13:00.812
I see.

13:01.715 --> 13:03.815
What's the matter?

13:03.817 --> 13:06.384
Nothing. Nothing at all.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.924
Too much caffeine?

13:12.926 --> 13:16.327
Will you try to show
a little sensitivity?

[instrumental music]

13:28.508 --> 13:30.341
Say, you're not
really upset

13:30.343 --> 13:33.178
because ALF has a crush
on Lynn, are you?

13:33.180 --> 13:35.580
- Yes, I am.
- 'Kate..'

13:36.850 --> 13:38.983
But it's not because
it isn't me.

13:38.985 --> 13:42.320
I don't like the idea of ALF
having a crush on our daughter.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.423
Well, it couldn't
possibly lead to anything.

13:46.693 --> 13:49.661
- Could it?
- I hope not.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.296
I'd like to be able
to show people pictures

13:51.298 --> 13:53.665
of our grandchildren.

13:53.667 --> 13:58.336
[sighs]
As long there's no
romantic involvement I'm okay.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.840
Well, does that go for
you and me, right now?

14:04.711 --> 14:06.411
Not at all.

14:12.552 --> 14:16.387
[laughing]
Scott, you are so funny.

14:16.389 --> 14:19.791
Singing into a parking mirror
like it was a microphone.

14:19.793 --> 14:21.726
Yeah, I guess
it was kinda cute.

14:21.728 --> 14:24.229
And then when you tapped
the meter and said..

14:24.231 --> 14:25.463
[imitating Scott]
"Is this on?"

14:25.465 --> 14:27.065
I thought I was gonna die.

14:27.067 --> 14:30.401
Yeah, well, I've been glad
to give you mouth-to-mouth.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.737
What a yutz.

14:32.739 --> 14:35.807
You know, Lynn, I had a nice
time tonight, that's no joke.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.042
Me too.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.677
I really would like
to see you again.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.880
- Are you free next Friday?
- No.

14:44.251 --> 14:47.852
- Who was that?
- Uh...my dad.

14:47.854 --> 14:50.889
Your dad? He seemed like
such a nice guy.

'Hey, zit face go home
and make a Clearasil sandwich.'

14:56.763 --> 15:01.599

- 'How about it sequoia neck?'

15:01.601 --> 15:04.569
'You're gonna walk
or do I turn on the hose?'

15:06.039 --> 15:08.172
Look, Lynn, I'd better go. I
don't wanna get this jacket wet.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.774
No, uh, no, Scott--

15:09.776 --> 15:11.609
He sounds like he means
business here, really.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.078
Look, he may not even
be talking about you.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.849
Maybe he's watching a movie,
or fighting with my mom.

15:17.851 --> 15:20.685
He calls your mom sequoia neck?

15:20.687 --> 15:24.022
- Well, not very often.
- 'Hit the road, Scott.'

15:25.392 --> 15:27.458
I think he means me,
Lynn, see ya.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.869
Oh, hi, who won the game?

15:39.639 --> 15:42.640
ALF, how dare you
insult Scott?

15:42.642 --> 15:45.276
What is all this
yelling about?

15:45.278 --> 15:47.312
I was just getting
rid of a vagrant.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.913
He made Scott leave.

15:48.915 --> 15:52.417
If I hadn't scared the guy away,
he would've tried to kiss her.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.385
I was hoping he would.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.056
Well, just a small kiss.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.490
That's the way it starts.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.759
First a small kiss,

16:08.134 --> 16:09.834
Close your robe, Willie.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.336
Oh.

16:11.338 --> 16:14.672
ALF, ALF..

16:14.674 --> 16:18.643
...I think it's time
we discussed the facts of life

16:18.645 --> 16:22.647
as they apply to you,
and our teenage daughter.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.416
Now, uh, in case
you don't know

16:25.418 --> 16:29.287
girls Lynn's age
date teenage boys.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.655
I've learned to accept that.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.524
And I'm afraid, you're gonna
have to do the same.

16:33.526 --> 16:37.028
Fine. See if I care
who she dates.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.630
And you could forget
about the song.

16:39.632 --> 16:42.667
- What song?
- I said forget it.

16:42.669 --> 16:47.171
ALF wrote you a song,
and he made a video from it.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.540
ALF, you wrote me a song?

16:53.113 --> 16:56.881
- Dad, can I talk to ALF alone?
- Yeah, sure.

16:58.852 --> 17:02.320
And in the morning,
will you please call Scott?

17:02.322 --> 17:05.223
And tell him I didn't mean
any of those things I said.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.624
Will you tell him
I didn't say them?

17:06.626 --> 17:08.726
Hey, get off my case, will you?

17:08.728 --> 17:11.863
I have not begun
to get on your case, mister.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.931

- Dad.

17:15.068 --> 17:18.903

Who does he think he<i> is?</i>

17:21.408 --> 17:23.074
ALF, can I see the video?

17:23.076 --> 17:26.744
No, I decided
it's for Connie Chung.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.579
Are you sure
I can't see it?

17:30.417 --> 17:33.584
Well, just once.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.787
Turn on the VCR.

17:43.530 --> 17:46.264

it's because I thought
