WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.717
So, this is a dating app
for men under 5'6".

00:08.800 --> 00:12.679
This one is for guys who say they read
<i>Infinite Jest </i>and women who can't read.

00:12.762 --> 00:15.432
This one is King of Queens:
ugly guys and hot girls.

00:15.515 --> 00:16.558
All sounds bad.

00:16.641 --> 00:19.269
There's Puckered for Parolees,
Coffin Season,

00:19.352 --> 00:21.855
and an app for Koreans,
but it's mostly white dudes.

00:21.938 --> 00:24.065
-Does normal Tinder exist?
-It does.

00:24.149 --> 00:26.526
People just use it
to buy and sell used furniture.

00:26.609 --> 00:28.486
-But, fine.
-I'm so excited.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.572
You dating again
and moving on from Eliza.

00:30.655 --> 00:31.614
Percy.

00:32.157 --> 00:35.035
She already knows about your big crush.
She forced it out of me.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.495
You begged to tell me on the ride home.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.873
I don't think it matters who begged who.

00:39.956 --> 00:42.459
Maybe you're right.
I need to put myself out there.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.919
-It's the best way to move on from Eliza.
-Right.

00:45.003 --> 00:48.590
-I could be your Hitch.
-I don't love being Kevin James here.

00:48.673 --> 00:51.593
I get that. Who would?
But there's only one person in this room

00:51.676 --> 00:53.845
who could play the suave,
young Will Smith type.

00:53.928 --> 00:55.096
Uh-oh!

00:55.180 --> 00:57.974
-Don't get me started, man.
-Okay, what gives?

00:58.058 --> 01:00.185
I thought you two were in a slap fight
or something.

01:00.268 --> 01:02.312
That eviction thing
is water under the bridge.

01:02.395 --> 01:05.523
-It's gravy between me and Timmy.
-It's just business.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.901
-Can't stay mad at my P-dog.
-Do I have to be here?

01:07.984 --> 01:10.570
We need a young person
who knows what the hell they doing.

01:12.113 --> 01:13.490
-Can't this wait?
-Sit.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.325
-Hmm.
-Tuck your chin.

01:16.826 --> 01:17.660
Ugh.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.579
Hey, can you look
less like you own a ukulele?

01:19.662 --> 01:22.082
I'll use the one from your Yelp profile.

01:22.165 --> 01:25.126
-That's a stock photo of a ladybug.
-Here's your profile.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.420
-Start swiping.
-Ooh! Let's go.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.340
Huh. Oh!

01:30.423 --> 01:34.469
-This girl is a pediatric nurse.
-Hey.

01:34.552 --> 01:37.639
Whose favorite band is Sugar Ray.
I'm not ready this.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.974
-I wanna date but this feels too fast.
-No, Timmy.

01:40.058 --> 01:43.061
Yes, too fast for Timmy.
Setting up a profile is a good start.

01:43.144 --> 01:45.730
-Leave it at that.
-You can't just quit in the middle.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.816
This isn't mid-Season 3 of<i> Empire.</i>

01:47.899 --> 01:51.486
Look, I wanna move on from Eliza,
but I need to take it slow.

01:51.569 --> 01:55.490
The last time I dated we all hated
Anne Hathaway for some reason.

01:55.573 --> 01:58.284
Don't wait too long.
You're a business owner.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.204
You did the Whole 30, twice.
And you smell good.

02:01.287 --> 02:02.914
You are in your prime now.

02:02.997 --> 02:06.918
-What's it like living such a dream?
-It has its ups and downs.

02:07.001 --> 02:08.503
-Don't fall for it.
-Sarcasm.

02:08.586 --> 02:09.879
-Almost got you.
-Come on.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.554
No, I get that
you're coming from practice.

02:17.637 --> 02:21.558
I just prefer that you didn't wear
soccer cleats to our date night.

02:23.476 --> 02:28.189
No, I know that Buffalo Wild Wings
doesn't have a dress code, it's just--

02:28.273 --> 02:30.066
I am excited.

02:30.150 --> 02:30.984
Okay.

02:31.776 --> 02:32.610
Great.

02:33.194 --> 02:34.112
See you there.

02:35.822 --> 02:39.242
-Couldn't help overhear.
-I saw you miming pushing buttons.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.077
You have a distracting voice.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.580
But is everything okay?

02:43.663 --> 02:47.458
Yeah, Aaron and I
have been doing these date nights

02:47.542 --> 02:48.960
ever since we got back together

02:49.043 --> 02:52.338
and I guess I just forgot
how different we are.

02:52.422 --> 02:55.258
Like, he wants to do a zombie themed
escape room,

02:55.341 --> 02:57.552
and I never wanna do that ever.

02:57.635 --> 02:59.804
Well, what do you want?

03:01.389 --> 03:02.307
Oh.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.101
Wow, uh...

03:05.185 --> 03:07.478
Candles, flowers.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.105
Just a simple dinner.

03:09.189 --> 03:12.275
-Somewhere that doesn't do commercials.
-Does Iron Creek have that?

03:12.358 --> 03:14.652
There's this new French restaurant

03:14.736 --> 03:17.405
that just opened called Petite Maison.

03:17.488 --> 03:19.657
You know they only have
like six or seven months

03:19.741 --> 03:22.035
before they close
and become a Jiffy Lube, so...

03:22.118 --> 03:24.996
The French restaurant
to Jiffy Lube pipeline.

03:25.079 --> 03:28.333
-Our town hates nice things.
-Have you told Aaron this?

03:28.416 --> 03:33.338
No, he's really trying.
I don't wanna make him feel bad.

03:33.421 --> 03:36.841
-You've come to the right person.
-You were eavesdropping.

03:36.925 --> 03:37.884
It's simple.

03:37.967 --> 03:40.678
When I want something
and Raul doesn't get it,

03:40.762 --> 03:44.015
I just drop hints
until he thinks it's his idea.

03:44.098 --> 03:47.477
The trick is to be very subtle.

03:48.895 --> 03:49.896
Hmm...

03:52.273 --> 03:53.858
Bonjour, mon <i>Amelie.</i>

03:53.942 --> 03:58.112
Your cashmere blend
has a certain je ne sais quoi.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.739
<i>Uh... huh?</i>

04:00.865 --> 04:02.742
Hey, bud. Hey.

04:03.952 --> 04:06.287
Carlos? I'm ready to check out.

04:06.371 --> 04:10.750
Oh, um, we're doing self-check out today.
You practically work here.

04:10.833 --> 04:14.045
And you're the only one
who rents <i>How the West Was Fun.</i>

04:14.921 --> 04:18.925
Well, my encouragement calendar did say,
"Let today be an adventure."

04:19.008 --> 04:20.051
So...

04:21.886 --> 04:22.887
Oh.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.685
Ah, Los, you all right?

04:29.644 --> 04:31.479
My ex-girlfriend got married.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.856
-Oh, no, that can be--
-To herself.

04:33.940 --> 04:34.941
Yikes.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.360
Sorry, it's saying that DOS is offline.

04:37.443 --> 04:41.030
What's your problem of the week?
Hit me. I'm on fire today.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.865
Carlos' ex married herself.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.452
-Huh. How does that make you feel?
-Relieved.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.621
We broke up
after that Modest Mouse concert.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.124
Can't believe you dated someone
who married themselves

04:51.207 --> 04:52.709
or listened to Modest Mouse.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.211
I wouldn't think that would be your type.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.797
-I don't have a type.
-Everyone has a type.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.799
I dated five Santa Clauses

04:59.882 --> 05:03.386
before I realized
I'm attracted to men who work at the mall.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.431
It's saying there are no copies
of <i>New York Minute</i>,

05:06.514 --> 05:08.266
but that's the movie
I'm trying to check out.

05:08.349 --> 05:10.601
What is it with you and the Olsen twins?

05:10.685 --> 05:13.479
They have a lifetime
of working off each other.

05:13.563 --> 05:14.647
Aw.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.734
You see, I fall in love
beyond type or exteriors.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.193
I'm attracted to souls.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.904
-Excuse me for containing multitudes.

05:21.988 --> 05:25.658
I guarantee I can figure out your type.
Let's start with Damon.

05:25.742 --> 05:29.078
Damon is totally different
from the guy I'm going out with tonight,

05:29.162 --> 05:31.748
who was totally different from Marie,
who married herself.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.499
She didn't even have abs.

05:34.500 --> 05:38.421
Hmm. Abs, abs, abs.

05:38.504 --> 05:39.756
BLM square.

05:40.256 --> 05:42.175
Abs, abs, abs.

05:42.258 --> 05:44.427
-France. French.

05:44.510 --> 05:48.473
Snails and hard bread.

05:49.265 --> 05:52.101
<i>Unrelated, that </i>Bourne Identity <i>poster</i>
<i>remindsme</i>

05:52.185 --> 05:55.271
<i>we should try that new French restaurant.</i>

05:56.189 --> 06:00.902
Oh. Yeah, I guess technically
that movie was set in France.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.278
<i>Yeah, the best parts.</i>

06:03.196 --> 06:04.322
Great idea.

06:04.864 --> 06:05.823
Is that <i>Friday?</i>

06:06.574 --> 06:07.825
What you know about <i>Friday?</i>

06:07.909 --> 06:12.121
-"You just got knocked the fuck out!"
-Why are you still here?

06:12.205 --> 06:15.583
-Don't you have a store to run?
-I do. The only people in my store now

06:15.666 --> 06:18.628
are ones that ask questions
but don't buy anything.

06:18.711 --> 06:21.464
Hey, why do party plates
come in packs of 16?

06:21.547 --> 06:23.383
Fifteen and 20 are right there.

06:23.466 --> 06:26.177
If I knew the answer
to that profound question,

06:26.260 --> 06:27.887
I would tell everyone.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.515
There he is. Timbo, hey.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.850
How's my favorite smooth-ankled
Blockbuster owner?

06:32.934 --> 06:34.602
Uh, good.

06:34.685 --> 06:37.355
I know you're a busy,
sexy little businessman,

06:37.438 --> 06:39.023
with your monocle and your top hat,

06:39.107 --> 06:41.192
but tonight's trivia night
at the Ripped Donkey

06:41.275 --> 06:42.860
and you promised you'd go with me.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.487
So, what do you say?

06:44.570 --> 06:47.198
-Oh, uh...
-That sounds so fun.

06:47.281 --> 06:50.451
And weren't you just saying
how free you are tonight?

06:50.535 --> 06:51.911
He just said that.

06:51.994 --> 06:54.163
Yes, it does sound fun but, ooh,

06:54.247 --> 06:57.458
tonight's tough because
I have a lot of business stuff.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.044
You know, paper, pens, stapler.

07:00.128 --> 07:03.714
I wish I was on that plate,
then you could just eat me up.

07:03.798 --> 07:06.175
It's okay. I'll never stop trying, ever.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.387
I had to come by anyway,
I need to re-watch <i>Pretty Woman,</i>

07:09.470 --> 07:10.972
for the sex moves.

07:11.681 --> 07:15.268
I honestly aspire
to be so openly off-putting.

07:16.060 --> 07:19.063
It worked. Me and Aaron
are going to Petite Maison tonight!

07:19.147 --> 07:21.649
Yes!
It always works to trick your husband.

07:21.732 --> 07:24.652
Yeah, but a good trick, though.
Like an ollie.

07:24.735 --> 07:27.155
-It's a real date.
-Wow!

07:27.238 --> 07:28.322
Congrats on the date.

07:28.406 --> 07:32.618
Looks like old A-Ron is stepping up
to bat a big romantic French homer.

07:32.702 --> 07:35.121
Which is so very European.

07:35.204 --> 07:39.292
And so cool for you and for me as well,
because I have a date too.

07:40.084 --> 07:44.672
Yes, me and Rene are going to trivia night
at the Ripped Donkey tonight.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.841
-Really?
-What? You are?

07:46.924 --> 07:47.758
We are?

07:48.342 --> 07:49.802
-We are.
-Congrats.

07:49.886 --> 07:54.807
-I guess love is in the air.
-Yes, yes, love is in the air. Oh!

07:54.891 --> 07:57.435
You've heard of fifth base?
That's also where we're going.

07:57.518 --> 07:58.686
Oh.

08:00.021 --> 08:00.855
Oh, gosh.

08:01.898 --> 08:06.652
That was so gross
and hot at the same time.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.907
It's not often you see a cheek kiss
with tongue.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.159
Her tongue was rough like a cat.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.538
-God, what did I do? I have to cancel.
-Hey.

08:17.622 --> 08:22.543
-I can't actually go on a date with Rene.
-Rene is... Rene is Rene.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.588
-It's not a crazy idea.
-No, it's a crazy person.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.673
She has truck nuts on her Miata.

08:27.757 --> 08:32.011
Look, you just need some
low pressure dates to get started.

08:32.094 --> 08:33.763
You put Eliza on a pedestal.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.641
The good thing about Rene
is she's on the floor.

08:36.724 --> 08:39.393
Despite what that sounds like, I get it.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.437
Rene's a lot, but she is a business owner.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.607
Gotta admire a woman
who beat pink eye so many times.

08:44.690 --> 08:47.443
-So many times.
-She is resilient.

08:47.527 --> 08:51.030
Timmy, trust me,
I just wanna see you get over Eliza.

08:51.113 --> 08:53.241
And I just want
something to do besides work.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.535
A low pressure date.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.578
-Ooh, uh-oh.
-Okay, maybe. I...

08:58.329 --> 09:02.083
-We're starting up. I feel it coming.
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.377
-Okay.
-Get it rolling.

09:04.460 --> 09:06.963
Get it cranked up, baby.
Get it cranked up.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.172
-Elbow.
-Up.

09:14.637 --> 09:17.098
So, you're attracted to Tyler Perry.

09:17.181 --> 09:20.059
As Madea, important caveat.

09:20.142 --> 09:24.689
I'm also attracted to Tessa Thompson
in the Taika Waititi-Rita Ora throuple,

09:24.772 --> 09:28.734
Indya Moore in <i>Escape Room 2,</i>
and Brad Pitt in <i>Benjamin Button,</i>

09:28.818 --> 09:31.028
but when he's old, so hot.

09:32.029 --> 09:36.158
Okay, so this isn't working.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.828
Ooh, guys! Me and my girlfriends
used to play a game

09:38.911 --> 09:42.123
where we picked which of the Ninja Turtles
would be the best boyfriend.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.834
Since they look the same,
it's all about their personality.

09:44.917 --> 09:50.423
-Little sixth grade sleepover, I like it.
-We're turtling the playing field.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.385
-Hey-- Oh, wow.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.972
I'm not used to seeing you
in outside-of-work clothes.

09:58.055 --> 10:00.975
Like when I saw my geometry teacher
restocking milk at Kroger.

10:01.058 --> 10:02.810
Well, what do you think?

10:04.770 --> 10:08.733
Buddy, walk me through
the thought process here.

10:08.816 --> 10:12.111
Chain over a collared shirt and a sweater.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.821
I'm gonna lose the chain.

10:13.904 --> 10:17.241
It's part of an old and now problematic
Halloween costume anyway.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.951
-May I?

10:22.705 --> 10:24.915
Hmm. There we go.

10:25.499 --> 10:26.334
There.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.461
Much better.

10:29.879 --> 10:33.132
So... date with Rene, huh?

10:33.215 --> 10:34.508
At the Donkey?

10:34.592 --> 10:37.511
Is she allowed near the darts
after the incident?

10:37.595 --> 10:40.264
The DA couldn't prove motive.
Also, it's platonic.

10:40.348 --> 10:43.684
But you have inspired me to
start looking for a serious relationship.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.312
You know,
someone to share all of this with.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.064
Oh.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.816
Cool. Proud of you.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.527
Yeah, I just feel like it's time.
You know?

10:56.697 --> 10:57.531
Yeah.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.494
Well, I better get going.
We have reservations at 7:00.

11:01.577 --> 11:05.581
Yeah. Have fun and tell Aaron I say,
"What's up," I mean, "Hello."

11:05.665 --> 11:08.668
Or don't tell him anything.
I'll just e-mail him.

11:09.627 --> 11:10.878
-Okay.
-Yeah.

11:15.257 --> 11:17.218
But Leonardo is ambidextrous.

11:17.301 --> 11:20.012
So hot when someone
can use both their hands.

11:20.096 --> 11:24.183
I mean, Michelangelo's a party boy,
but I think it's Raphael for me.

11:24.266 --> 11:26.310
Okay, I'm more lost
than with the celebrities.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.812
Hey, we talking Turtles?

11:27.895 --> 11:30.272
-Hey.
-Whoa! Okay, Timmy.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.108
You look like a cool English professor

11:32.191 --> 11:34.652
with an unorthodox,
but exciting approach to teaching.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.445
Who knew you could look this good?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.447
I don't know. No one, I guess?

11:38.531 --> 11:40.908
-What's up?
-We're trying to figure out Carlos' type.

11:40.991 --> 11:43.077
But all the people he's dated
are so different.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.829
-We're--
-Turtling the playing field.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.038
So, what iteration?

11:46.122 --> 11:48.749
'90s live action,
Saturday morning cartoon,

11:48.833 --> 11:51.293
Michael Bay reboot I refuse to recognize?

11:51.377 --> 11:55.339
Either way, the most attractive turtle,
hands down, is Leonardo.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.300
He's a born leader.
Okay, have a great night.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.511
Yeah.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.013
He's our Leonardo.

12:06.183 --> 12:08.102
I hear they have an excellent soufflé.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.687
-Oh.
-Do you wanna--?

12:10.813 --> 12:13.274
You want a soufflé?

12:13.357 --> 12:19.739
Because there's-- there's also coq au vin,
et boules de boeuf and moules marinières.

12:19.822 --> 12:23.284
Oh, someone got
their Google pronounce on.

12:23.367 --> 12:27.204
I practiced for an hour and a half
but probably saying it wrong.

12:27.288 --> 12:30.624
-Well, thanks for trying.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.253
Bonjour, monsieur, madame.

12:34.336 --> 12:36.714
Anything I can start for you? Beverages?

12:36.797 --> 12:40.426
Yes, I will have a glass
of this Chateau Montelena.

12:40.926 --> 12:44.764
Do you have the beer where
the mountains turn blue when it's cold?

12:44.847 --> 12:47.266
No, we most certainly do not.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.977
Sorry, of course.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.604
Just nervous.

12:52.271 --> 12:55.274
-I'll have whatever beer you have.
-Of course.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.901
In a glass, bonjour.

12:59.820 --> 13:04.033
Jim Henson, Mario Lopez,
Kris Jenner, and Biz Markie.

13:04.116 --> 13:07.036
-I would <i>Freaky Friday</i> with any of them.
-Uh-huh.

13:07.119 --> 13:09.789
I wonder how Kermit's
vibing in heaven now.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.082
I'd love to see the other side
through that lens.

13:12.166 --> 13:15.127
Can you please shut up?
I'm trying to cancel Timmy's other dates.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.880
-What?
-Yeah, well, I messaged all these women

13:17.963 --> 13:20.800
that wanna go out on a date
with Timmy tonight.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.093
Don't cancel.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.721
You want Timmy to have more than one date

13:25.805 --> 13:27.056
while he's with Rene?

13:27.139 --> 13:28.808
Sometimes you gotta jump out the car

13:28.891 --> 13:31.393
and hope the semi behind you slows down.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.603
But isn't this--

13:32.686 --> 13:35.815
I can't believe I'm saying it,
but a little mean?

13:35.898 --> 13:36.732
What's going on?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.943
Look, ever since Eliza showed up,

13:39.026 --> 13:41.862
all he cares about is her or the store.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.864
I miss my boy.

13:43.948 --> 13:47.535
So is that why you've been spending
so much time with me?

13:49.161 --> 13:51.956
-Reply all: "See you tonight."
-Where you going?

13:52.665 --> 13:55.292
I'm going to the Donkey to watch.
I'm not missing this.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.210
I'm in.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.213
-I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.
-Come on.

13:59.296 --> 14:01.131
-We're a team.
-We're not.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.633
I'm trying to get rid of you.

14:02.716 --> 14:04.969
-It's like Tinder in real life.
-Okay.

14:05.052 --> 14:08.681
Swipe left on the customers you don't like
and right on the customers you do.

14:08.764 --> 14:11.183
Finally, something that
kind of makes sense.

14:11.267 --> 14:15.062
Uh, left on her. She looks kind.

14:16.063 --> 14:19.900
Ugh. He always says thank you.
She smiles way too much.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.653
We get it, you have teeth.
You aren't special.

14:23.320 --> 14:27.658
-Left, left, left. I hate Quinn.
-I don't even know if they like movies.

14:27.741 --> 14:30.828
They come in here all the time
and make everything about themselves.

14:30.911 --> 14:35.291
I once got caught in a 4-hour conversation
with Quinn about AM radio waves.

14:35.374 --> 14:39.044
Yeah, that's gonna be
a big swipe right for me, dawg.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.046
You could tell Quinn
to come Quinn me over.

14:42.840 --> 14:47.761
All right, trivia daddies.
Next round is "Places I got colds in."

14:47.845 --> 14:51.140
Whoo! We love you, Motown Larry!

14:51.223 --> 14:54.935
Hey, Motown Larry loves
all you. Okay, first question.

14:55.019 --> 14:58.814
In Chicago there's a famous building
with the same name as a department store.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.609
Is it the JCPenney Tower,
the Nordstrom Tower,

15:01.692 --> 15:04.737
the Kohls Tower, or none of the above?

15:04.820 --> 15:06.655
How'd he get the name Motown Larry?

15:06.739 --> 15:10.034
Motown Chuck doesn't
have the same ring to it, does it?

15:10.618 --> 15:12.578
Wait, is his name not even Larry?

15:14.079 --> 15:15.706
Oh, I love a Long Island iced tea.

15:15.789 --> 15:18.792
Oh, did you want to get another straw?
We could Tramp and Tramp it.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.253
No, I'll stick to my diet White Claw.

15:21.337 --> 15:24.590
I think Motown Larry
doesn't know that the Sears Tower,

15:24.673 --> 15:26.133
is now called the Willis Tower,

15:26.216 --> 15:30.054
but, either way,
the answer is none of the above.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.972
Oh, here we go. Thank you.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.849
Wow, sexy and a scholar.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.267
A friend scholar.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.770
The correct answer was none of the above.

15:37.853 --> 15:43.150
Which means our leading team is still
Rene and Timmy's Most Excellent Team.

15:46.987 --> 15:50.532
-Oh, okay.
-Are you Timmy?

15:50.616 --> 15:52.534
Uh... Yes, hi?

15:52.618 --> 15:57.039
-I'm here for our date.
-I think you're here for some other Timmy.

15:57.122 --> 16:01.418
-I don't have a date tonight.
-Yeah, except for our date.

16:01.502 --> 16:05.005
Which I will remind you
is more of a meeting amongst peers.

16:05.089 --> 16:08.634
You're less weird looking in person,
which never happens.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.844
I mean, this is you, right?

16:11.637 --> 16:14.223
Wow, I am so proud of you.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.684
Want to make a profile
of your mom's new boyfriend

16:16.767 --> 16:18.185
and mess with him a bit?

16:18.268 --> 16:20.062
I kind of already started one.

16:20.145 --> 16:22.982
Mm! That's my girl right there.

16:24.942 --> 16:25.776
Yeah.

16:26.276 --> 16:29.196
I've been to the Maldives seven times,
but one was a layover.

16:29.279 --> 16:31.490
The first couple times,
I went with my parents...

16:31.573 --> 16:34.785
You into this?
That toothy freak left you her number.

16:34.868 --> 16:37.496
Yeah, there's just something about them.

16:37.579 --> 16:40.916
If you go to the Maldives,
I recommend an eight-day trip.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.212
Seven is doable,
but you're not getting enough 'dives, IMO.

16:45.295 --> 16:48.257
Oh, my God. I know what your type is.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.843
-You like self-absorbed people.
-What? No.

16:50.926 --> 16:54.722
I picked Raphael not Donatello,
who's obviously the self-absorbed one.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.056
Oh, please.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.809
Donatello's more self-absorbed
than Raphael?

16:58.892 --> 17:01.103
-Now you just sound crazy.
-So nice...

17:01.186 --> 17:03.689
-Oh, God. You might be right.
-I know I am!

17:03.772 --> 17:07.526
Flying private, though,
it's not the luxury people think it is.

17:07.609 --> 17:08.569
It's all here.

17:08.652 --> 17:10.779
The ex-girlfriend who married herself,

17:10.863 --> 17:13.198
the personal trainer
who only cares about his abs

17:13.282 --> 17:14.825
and performative activism,

17:14.908 --> 17:18.620
and Quinn, who never stops talking
about themself, no offense.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.166
I used to play rugby when I lived
in London for a quarter semester abroad.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.084
I like to live offensively,

17:24.168 --> 17:28.380
always ready for a bungie jump,
swim with sharks, bite of raw chicken.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.673
I'm up for anything.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.259
I'd swim in a pool of blood if I had to...

17:32.342 --> 17:36.638
So, I messaged you to come here
for a date with me tonight as well?

17:36.722 --> 17:40.059
-Yep. And you were quite forward.
-With me too.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.519
You texted, "Let's let it all hang out."

17:42.603 --> 17:45.481
With a GIF of Lenny Kravitz
splitting his pants.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.066
Objectively hilarious.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.109
Timmy, what the hell is going on?

17:49.193 --> 17:51.487
-Yeah, start talking.
-I...

17:57.326 --> 17:59.495
Okay, so... funny story.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.205
Um...

18:01.288 --> 18:04.124
My friends have been trying
to help me get over someone,

18:04.208 --> 18:05.584
but I'm not ready to date yet,

18:05.667 --> 18:08.712
so they must have called you all
to give me a push.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.297
I am so sorry.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.466
Can I make it up to you with an Uber pool?

18:12.549 --> 18:13.383
Yes.

18:13.467 --> 18:17.554
Typically having two other women
on my date would be a deal-breaker,

18:17.638 --> 18:20.682
but my therapist said
to be more open-minded.

18:20.766 --> 18:25.229
So here I am starting over after a divorce
and two freak ski accidents.

18:25.896 --> 18:30.192
Yeah. At least you're not married.
My Zumba class got canceled anyway.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.111
-Must be fate.
-No, no.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.780
-It's really-- It's--
-Okay.

18:34.863 --> 18:39.701
Okay. Look, if I know Motown Larry,
and I do know Motown Larry intimately,

18:39.785 --> 18:42.579
he's not gonna allow us
to add two new players.

18:42.663 --> 18:46.834
So, you know, why don't you ladies
kindly just get the hell out.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.503
Why don't you get another Long Island.

18:49.586 --> 18:50.838
-Okay?

18:50.921 --> 18:53.423
I will get myself another LIIT
when I am good and ready.

18:53.507 --> 18:56.802
-Okay?
-Hey, anyone read any good books lately?

18:57.594 --> 18:58.846
<i>Bossypants.</i>

19:01.056 --> 19:01.974
"First, Lord:"

19:02.057 --> 19:03.851
-"No tattoos."
-"No tattoos."

19:03.934 --> 19:05.644
-Yes!

19:06.270 --> 19:07.396
Oh!

19:07.479 --> 19:09.523
Didn't realize my type was Tina Fey fans.

19:09.606 --> 19:12.901
That book is why I had my
Winnie-the-Pooh tramp stamp lasered off.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.653
-Stop.
-Same.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.947
-Yes!
-Great, we're getting along.

19:17.030 --> 19:20.576
Okay, so I'm gonna grab another round
before this changes.

19:27.082 --> 19:30.544
Hey, Eliza, what happened
to your whole fancy date night?

19:30.627 --> 19:32.588
Still happening. Aaron's parking.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.799
He really wanted a beer where
the mountain turns blue.

19:35.883 --> 19:39.344
So... and turns out
I don't really like French food.

19:39.428 --> 19:43.348
I think I just wanted him
to want to take me there, I guess.

19:44.224 --> 19:46.226
I don't know. It's stupid.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.061
No, it's not. I get it.

19:48.145 --> 19:49.605
Thanks.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.941
So, are you on a quadruple date right now?

19:53.025 --> 19:55.611
Oh, yes, it's going very badly.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.781
Didn't take you for such a chick magnet.

19:59.865 --> 20:04.119
Oh. Sorry. I think I got
jalapeño margarita in my eyeball.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.120
Oh, God.

20:05.829 --> 20:07.706
-Oh, can I borrow that?
-Yeah.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.750
-Here.
-It really burns. Oh, yeah.

20:11.001 --> 20:13.253
Hey, are you okay?

20:13.337 --> 20:15.130
I knew I dated narcissists,

20:15.214 --> 20:17.633
I didn't think I'm, like,
literally attracted to them.

20:17.716 --> 20:18.592
I get it.

20:19.426 --> 20:22.888
A himbo that doesn't ask
personal questions. Heaven.

20:22.971 --> 20:25.974
I think you're afraid
to show people your true self.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.311
You refused to tell me
your last name until a month ago.

20:29.394 --> 20:32.648
Well, I've had a lot
of near misses with identity theft.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.442
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I am too guarded.

20:35.525 --> 20:38.570
But I'm afraid to open up
because I could get hurt.

20:38.654 --> 20:41.114
Or worse, someone could leak
my sordid past to DeuxMoi.

20:41.198 --> 20:44.326
Knowing the problem
is the first step to making changes.

20:44.409 --> 20:50.457
My God, should I be a therapist?
Or at least, like, a fixer?

20:50.540 --> 20:53.460
You gonna cancel your date tonight
with abs guy?

20:53.543 --> 20:57.214
You could come with me
to my friend's bovine birthing ceremony.

20:57.297 --> 21:00.509
As horrifying as that sounds,
I'm not gonna cancel.

21:00.592 --> 21:04.263
I deserve to bore someone
with the details of my personal life.

21:04.346 --> 21:07.474
I can't think of a more romantic place
to do it then Petite Maison.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.476
It's two weeks tops
before it's a Pep Boys.

21:09.559 --> 21:12.854
-I need an oil change soon.
-I don't care if a first date's too early.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.440
I'm gonna talk about
my childhood battle with gout.

21:16.149 --> 21:17.609
Tonight is all about me.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.112
He just wants to sleep with him.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.823
Is a jalapeño seed in there?

21:23.907 --> 21:26.368
-I don't see anything.
-Are you sure?

21:26.451 --> 21:28.745
-Yeah.
-Damn.

21:28.829 --> 21:29.871
Yeah, this sucks.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.915
I really wanted to help him
get over Eliza.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.960
I knew there was a part of you
that actually cared.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.003
Yeah, whatever.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.422
So it wasn't just about
getting me off your back.

21:38.505 --> 21:41.633
Maybe you even like
hanging out with me a little.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.927
Looks like we're moving on too.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.762
I wouldn't know by how you're dressed.

21:45.846 --> 21:48.140
Looks like you kidnapped
Johnny Depp's stylist.

21:48.223 --> 21:51.310
Try being more like Timmy
and change your life too.

21:53.895 --> 21:55.981
Bottle of Jameson, please.

21:56.064 --> 21:57.399
I think we're good.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.609
-Oh, wow.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.862
For what it's worth, you look very fancy.

22:01.945 --> 22:04.031
In my dress I felt obligated to buy

22:04.114 --> 22:06.241
because the sales girl
got dumped that day?

22:06.325 --> 22:08.368
Thank you. You too.

22:08.452 --> 22:11.246
I haven't seen you this dressed up
since the midnight premiere

22:11.330 --> 22:13.248
of <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.</i>

22:13.332 --> 22:16.251
Wait, if all Aaron
wanted was a Coors Light,

22:16.335 --> 22:18.545
isn't there a bar
right next to the French place?

22:20.839 --> 22:22.758
This is my Cheers.

22:22.841 --> 22:25.010
Your nickname for the Ripped Donkey
is Shit Bar.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.430
Sure you weren't checking up
on old Timbo?

22:28.513 --> 22:30.974
It was on our way home, okay?

22:31.058 --> 22:34.853
Enough about the logistics of my night.
So who you taking home?

22:34.936 --> 22:38.982
Oh. None of them.
I'm just happy to be nominated tonight.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.692
Not even Rene?

22:40.776 --> 22:42.944
"I want to deworm you, Timmy."

22:45.697 --> 22:46.573
Oh.

22:47.449 --> 22:48.283
Yeah.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.660
I better get back to my dates.

22:50.744 --> 22:52.371
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

22:54.706 --> 22:57.209
I can get us a discount
on Spirit Airlines.

22:57.292 --> 23:00.003
My 13-year-old cousin
just got his pilot's license for them.

23:00.504 --> 23:01.421
Girls' trip.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.631
-Amazing.
-Yes.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.883
All right, who missed me?

23:04.966 --> 23:06.510
-I did.
-Thank you.

23:08.387 --> 23:12.391
I know tonight was kind of a bust,
but I wanted to get you something.

23:14.643 --> 23:17.354
-I'm trying, E.
-Okay.

23:18.271 --> 23:19.314
No. No!

23:20.190 --> 23:22.651
Chocolates from Chocolate by Bonnie Ray?

23:22.734 --> 23:27.280
You drove two towns over,
two hours round trip on Car Crash Lane

23:27.364 --> 23:30.617
and that weird bridge
to get my favorite chocolates?

23:30.700 --> 23:35.288
You are worth
all those foggy near-death turns.

23:36.331 --> 23:37.416
Let's go.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.626
I don't need my magic mountain beer.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.129
I just need you.

23:44.631 --> 23:45.966
That's a good idea.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.843
-I did good?
-Did real good.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.726
-Like Queen.
-The best.

23:56.810 --> 23:59.479
-Yeah.
-So, which one of us gets the rose?

23:59.563 --> 24:01.064
I wish I had three roses.
