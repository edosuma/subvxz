39:59.468 --> 40:01.430
I'LL BET HE DID.

40:01.430 --> 40:03.702
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

40:03.702 --> 40:05.434
I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU ADMIRE THE GUY.

40:05.434 --> 40:08.477
HE'S BRILLIANT.
HE'S ALSO COMPLETELY UNSTABLE.

40:08.477 --> 40:10.439
YOU'RE NEVER
GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

40:10.439 --> 40:12.010
A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP
WITH SOMEBODY LIKE THAT.

40:12.010 --> 40:15.113
YOU SAID SOMETHING TO HIM,
DIDN'T YOU?

40:15.113 --> 40:16.785
WHAT? NO.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

40:16.785 --> 40:19.748
OKAY, DONNIE,
I CAN TELL WHEN YOU'RE LYING.

40:19.748 --> 40:22.651
YOUR FACE LOOKS LIKE...
THAT.

40:22.651 --> 40:25.454
OKAY. FINE.

40:25.454 --> 40:28.997
MAYBE I HAD A LITTLE
MAN-TO-MAN WITH HIM.

40:28.997 --> 40:30.759
YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE,
YOU KNOW THAT?!

40:30.759 --> 40:32.631
WHAT IS THIS,

40:32.631 --> 40:34.733
LIKE YOUR JUVENILE WAY
OF TRYING TO GET ME BACK?
NO.

40:34.733 --> 40:36.835
I KNOW I LOST MY CHANCE
WITH YOU A LONG TIME AGO.

40:36.835 --> 40:38.807
I REALIZE THAT.
I JUST...

40:38.807 --> 40:40.739
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

40:40.739 --> 40:42.741
OKAY, WELL, FORGIVE ME
IF I FIND THAT

40:42.741 --> 40:44.072
A LITTLE HARD TO SWALLOW.

40:44.072 --> 40:48.176
IN FUTURE, STAY THE HELL
OUT OF MY PERSONAL LIFE.

40:48.176 --> 40:50.779
[ SIGHS ]

40:50.779 --> 40:55.684
FREUD ONCE SAID,
"NO MORTAL CAN KEEP A SECRET.

40:55.684 --> 40:59.187
"IF HIS LIPS ARE SILENT,
HE CHATTERS WITH HIS FINGERTIPS.

40:59.187 --> 41:03.061
BETRAYAL OOZES
OUT OF EVERY PORE."

41:03.061 --> 41:06.595
I THINK OLD SIGMUND
MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONTO SOMETHING.

41:06.595 --> 41:11.239
ALTHOUGH WE MAY BE DESPERATE
TO KEEP OUR SECRETS,

41:11.239 --> 41:13.542
THE HARDER
WE TRY TO BURY THEM,

41:13.542 --> 41:15.774
THE MORE
THEY RISE TO THE SURFACE.

41:15.774 --> 41:20.809
WE ARE NEUROLOGICALLY
COMPELLED TO CONFESS.

41:23.952 --> 41:26.655
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING.

41:26.655 --> 41:29.658
'CAUSE CONFESSION
IS GOOD FOR THE BODY.

41:29.658 --> 41:32.190
IT'S GOOD FOR THE BRAIN.

41:32.190 --> 41:34.192
MIGHT EVEN BE GOOD
FOR THE SOUL,

41:34.192 --> 41:36.194
IF YOU BELIEVE
IN THAT SORT OF THING.
