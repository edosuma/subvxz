Hello, I'm Brian Griffin.
And I'm Stewie Griffin.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.835
A few years ago, we did an
episode called "Viewer Mail"

00:36.837 --> 00:39.438
where you, our fans,
wrote in and suggested ideas

00:39.440 --> 00:40.939
for new episodes.

00:40.941 --> 00:43.976
Well, it's ten years later, but
you're still sending in ideas.

00:43.978 --> 00:46.645
Uh, to Rashad in Little Rock,
we wanna let you know

00:46.647 --> 00:50.182
we kicked around idea, "Make the
Baby Go Wild" for a while,

00:50.184 --> 00:52.284
couldn't really find
an angle on it.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.319
Here's one from
Lee Mills of Iowa.

00:54.321 --> 00:57.589
Lee writes: "Dear <i>Family Guy,</i>
<i>was your show based</i>
<i>on anything?"</i>

00:57.591 --> 00:59.124
That's a great question, Lee.

00:59.126 --> 01:01.994
In fact, Family Guy is based
on an American television series

01:01.996 --> 01:04.096
called <i>The Simpsons.</i>

01:04.098 --> 01:07.166
(chuckles) Actually, <i>Family Guy,</i>
<i>much like</i> <i>The Office,</i>

01:07.168 --> 01:09.435
is based on a British series
called <i>Chap of the Manor.</i>

01:09.437 --> 01:11.103
Let's watch.

01:13.973 --> 01:16.041
(farting)

01:18.878 --> 01:20.512
ANNOUNCER:
<i>We now return to Britain's</i>

01:20.514 --> 01:22.014
<i>most popular game show...</i>

01:22.016 --> 01:25.651
BRITISH AUDIENCE:
<i>Wheel... of... Politeness!</i>

01:25.653 --> 01:27.352
Do go ahead, then.
Oh, no, you first.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.321
Wouldn't dream of it.
Too kind, really, I insist.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.323
Wouldn't be proper of me.
I appreciate your courtesy.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.858
Likewise.
Well, we're
all out of time.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.159
Join us same time tomorrow

01:34.161 --> 01:36.195
if it's not entirely
inconvenient for you.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.763
If so, of course,
we do understand

01:37.765 --> 01:39.431
and we do apologize in advance.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.134
This has all been an imposition.
I'm so dreadfully sorry.

01:42.136 --> 01:43.135
Sorry!
Sorry.
Sorry.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.136
Sorry, everyone!

01:44.138 --> 01:45.871
All right, kids, enough telly.

01:45.873 --> 01:48.474
I hope everyone's peckish
for some boiled lamb shank.

01:48.476 --> 01:49.775
None for me, Lydia.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.343
I'm meeting me mates
down at the pub.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.712
Again? But Neville,
you spend all your time

01:53.714 --> 01:56.181
down at the Fox and Pig
and Dog and Wolf and Cat

01:56.183 --> 01:57.449
and Fiddle and
Whistle and Cock.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.917
And that's where
you're wrong.

01:58.919 --> 02:01.086
The Fox and Pig and Dog
and Wolf and Cat

02:01.088 --> 02:03.021
and Fiddle and Whistle and Cock
is for tossers.

02:03.023 --> 02:05.124
We're meetin' at the Dog and Cat
and Bull and Whistle

02:05.126 --> 02:07.192
and Fiddle and Cock
and Pig and Wolf and Carriage

02:07.194 --> 02:08.760
and Fife and Other Wolf!

02:08.762 --> 02:11.096
But I need you to stay and have
a chat with Collingsworth.

02:11.098 --> 02:13.465
I found him with another fag
in his mouth this morning.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.867
Oh, is that right?

02:14.869 --> 02:16.668
So you fancy fags, do you?

02:16.670 --> 02:19.171
Well, here.
Have a whole carton of fags!

02:19.173 --> 02:22.374
I just want a comely lass
to look upon me with favour.

02:22.376 --> 02:23.942
I look on you with favour.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.511
I look on all of you
with favour.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.112
Shut up, British Meg.

02:27.114 --> 02:28.113
(Texas accent)
Look at Lydia.

02:28.115 --> 02:30.649
What a two-bit Wichita whore.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.918
One of these days,
she's gonna wake up <i>killt.</i>

02:32.920 --> 02:34.419
Ah, matricide.

02:34.421 --> 02:36.488
Yet another of
your childhood whims.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.157
No, it ain't. I'm gonna follow
through with...

02:38.159 --> 02:39.758
Wait, why'd you say it
like that?

02:40.860 --> 02:42.528
Cutaway, sir?

02:42.530 --> 02:44.530
Yes, that's good then.

02:44.532 --> 02:47.466
Friends, family,
and characters random

02:47.468 --> 02:50.202
To bring you joy
and laughter in tandem

02:50.204 --> 02:53.005
To divert and dazzle
is our intention

02:53.007 --> 02:56.742
So sit back, relax,
and enjoy our invention.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.880
Ah, I love summer.

03:09.923 --> 03:12.624
Good evening, Billingsbury.
I'm Clive Crowley.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.093
Coming up: a man with a gun
and two bullets

03:15.095 --> 03:17.262
has taken over the city
of Manchester.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.965
But first, our top story
tonight: Her Majesty, the Queen,

03:19.967 --> 03:22.367
will be passing through
our very town tomorrow.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.169
With details, we now go live

03:24.171 --> 03:26.138
to Indian reporter,
Tricia Dasgupta.

03:26.140 --> 03:29.041
Oh, my golly,
there is much commotion.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.676
Thank you, Tricia.
After the interval,

03:30.678 --> 03:33.545
find out which 12 football teams
tied tonight.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.547
The Queen's comin'
to Billingsbury?

03:35.549 --> 03:37.115
That's bloody sweet!

03:37.117 --> 03:39.318
You know, I'm actually a
relation of the royal family.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.086
You most certainly are not.

03:41.088 --> 03:43.088
Where would you
get that idea?

03:43.090 --> 03:45.090
Me mum used to claim
she was a Windsor.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.960
And I always heard my Nana talk
about how she took a duke.

03:47.962 --> 03:49.461
Must've been a difficult
marriage, too,

03:49.463 --> 03:51.263
'cause every afternoon
she'd be belly-achin'

03:51.265 --> 03:52.798
about her bloody duke.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.033
I think you just had
a gross grandmother.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.135
No, I'm quite sure of it.
And to prove it,

03:57.137 --> 03:59.271
I'm gonna nick
one of the Queen's hairs

03:59.273 --> 04:00.939
during her visit tomorrow.

04:00.941 --> 04:04.009
And when the DNA proves a match,
you'll see I'm royalty.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.210
The Queen, eh?

04:05.212 --> 04:07.646
I'd like to mash my banger
in her blood pudding.

04:07.648 --> 04:08.680
Googity. Googity. Glop.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.882
Hello, lads.
Oh, hello, Seamus.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.185
Right fine performance
at the cricket match today.

04:13.187 --> 04:16.255
Aye. I was spirited to have you
down there watching me.

04:16.257 --> 04:18.090
P.A. ANNOUNCER:
Well, it's a brilliant day

04:18.092 --> 04:19.358
for a long and
confusing game of cricket.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.426
The field is teeming
with men in helmets

04:21.428 --> 04:23.161
who don't seem like
they need helmets,

04:23.163 --> 04:24.696
and men not in helmets

04:24.698 --> 04:26.031
who seem like they probably
should be wearing helmets.

04:26.033 --> 04:29.001
Oh, he's batted it
clear out of the stadium.

04:29.003 --> 04:32.804
Is that good? We don't know,
but it's what we do!

04:32.806 --> 04:33.972
Y-Yay!

04:33.974 --> 04:34.973
Boo!
Boo!

04:34.975 --> 04:36.108
Boo!

04:39.045 --> 04:42.147
Oh my goodness, the Queen is
going to be here presently.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.016
This is oh-so-exciting!

04:44.018 --> 04:46.084
My favorite part
before the Queen arrives

04:46.086 --> 04:49.021
is yelling "wanker"
at Prince Charles as he passes.

04:49.023 --> 04:50.422
Wanker!
Wanker!

04:50.424 --> 04:51.957
I know, I know.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.458
Wanker!
Wanker!

04:53.460 --> 04:55.160
Yes, I know. Yes.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.828
Wanker!
You're a wanker!

04:56.830 --> 04:58.830
Wanker!
Right, quite right.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.265
Spot on. He's got it.

05:00.267 --> 05:03.101
I say, a lot of people have
turned out to see the Queen.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.536
Should make for a grand day.

05:04.538 --> 05:07.572
Hey, watch it there!

05:15.682 --> 05:17.683
Good show, old chap.
Well played.

05:17.685 --> 05:18.784
Here she comes!

05:18.786 --> 05:20.352
(crowd cheering)

05:22.288 --> 05:23.989
Very well.
Time for action.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.292
A lock of the Queen's hair
shall soon be mine.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.027
Here she comes.
Have at it then.

05:29.029 --> 05:32.397
Crikey! This is a haircut
fit for a queen!

05:35.134 --> 05:36.535
Oh, bloody hell!

05:36.537 --> 05:38.870
All right, time for Plan B.
Let's go!

05:46.145 --> 05:47.846
I'm not going any lower.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.848
Well, Father,
you gave it a good go.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.784
Oh, we're not done yet.
Come on!

05:52.786 --> 05:54.119
(tires squeal)

05:54.121 --> 05:57.522
Queen! Queen! Give me
some of your hair!

05:57.524 --> 05:59.658
Come on, Queen!
Don't be a bitch!

05:59.660 --> 06:01.493
Get us away
from that lunatic!

06:01.495 --> 06:02.994
(tires squeal)

06:11.771 --> 06:13.338
She's heading into that tunnel!

06:14.607 --> 06:17.843
(crashing, horse neighs)

06:17.845 --> 06:20.812
GUARD (screaming):
Dear God! The Queen's dead!

06:20.814 --> 06:23.782
(both whistling)

06:23.784 --> 06:25.984
All right , Collingsworth,
I got a hair.

06:25.986 --> 06:29.354
Now, just walk away casual-like
and we're in the clear.

06:29.356 --> 06:30.989
Oh, no!
Here come the coppers!

06:30.991 --> 06:34.760
("Yakkity Sax" playing)

06:40.933 --> 06:43.301
(inhales deeply)

06:43.303 --> 06:44.669
Bugger.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.005
(inhales deeply)

06:47.007 --> 06:48.507
Bugger.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.609
(inhales deeply)

06:50.611 --> 06:51.943
Bugger.

06:54.881 --> 06:57.015
Well, it turns out
I'm not royalty.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.683
Shame about the Queen, though.

06:58.685 --> 07:01.253
Yeah, I reckon
she's with Jesus Christ
in heaven now.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.687
(spits)
(metallic ding)

07:02.689 --> 07:04.956
Well, I'm just happy our
family is safe and sound

07:04.958 --> 07:06.925
back in our cozy row house.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.560
Row house.

07:11.964 --> 07:14.199
(thunder rumbling)

07:16.135 --> 07:17.602
TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return

07:17.604 --> 07:19.771
to <i>The Comedy Central Roast</i>
<i>of Robin Williams.</i>

07:19.773 --> 07:22.007
Aw, man, Robin Williams
is my favorite!

07:22.009 --> 07:23.175
He must be getting recognized

07:23.177 --> 07:25.110
for all his contributions
to show business.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.645
I don't think
that's what a roast is.

07:26.647 --> 07:29.548
Robin, as a comic, it's an honor
to be up here roasting you.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.983
As a moviegoer, I want
to punch you in the face.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.452
(laughter)

07:33.454 --> 07:35.420
Oh, that's funny.
Advocate violence.

07:35.422 --> 07:36.922
And let's face it, Mork.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.857
You're getting Nanu-Na-old!

07:38.859 --> 07:40.926
(laughs)
(laughter)

07:40.928 --> 07:42.461
Stop it! You stop it!

07:42.463 --> 07:45.964
Robin Williams has a manic gift
that gladdens a sad world

07:45.966 --> 07:50.001
and all he asks in return
is our unceasing attention!

07:50.003 --> 07:52.003
How can you allow this?!

07:52.005 --> 07:55.106
Robin Williams has given us
nothing but joy!

07:55.108 --> 07:57.342
I wish everyone
was Robin Williams!

07:57.344 --> 08:00.111
(thunder rumbling)
(electric sizzling)

08:01.447 --> 08:03.949
Boy, that looks enticing.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.484
(thunder rumbling)
(electric sizzling)

08:05.486 --> 08:09.054
Yeah, this is nice.

08:13.292 --> 08:15.760
Oh, my God.
What happened?

08:15.762 --> 08:18.630
You were in a coma, and then I
kissed you, and you woke up.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.031
(mumbles)
Like two days later.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.033
Anyway, all your
numbers are normal.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.702
What numbers?
No idea.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.705
Well, congratulations.
You're gonna be just fine.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.173
(electric buzzing)

08:28.175 --> 08:29.674
Oh, my God!

08:29.676 --> 08:31.042
You're...
You're Robin Williams!

08:31.044 --> 08:33.945
Ding! Thank you for playing
"That's Obvious!"

08:33.947 --> 08:35.046
Tell him what he's won, Cletus!

08:35.048 --> 08:36.314
(hick accent): Money!
(normal): Ho-ho! Money.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.315
Or as the Republicans
call it,

08:37.317 --> 08:38.350
(imitating witch):
Mine!

08:38.352 --> 08:39.918
(laughs)

08:39.920 --> 08:41.520
I hope this is covered
by your HMO.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.622
I was covered once by
an HMO in San Francisco.

08:43.624 --> 08:46.024
I Haight my Ashbury
in these jeans!

08:46.026 --> 08:47.459
Ding-ding, Rice-A-Roni!

08:47.461 --> 08:50.662
Ah! You got all those
references in there!

08:50.664 --> 08:52.030
Of course now everyone
can afford health care

08:52.032 --> 08:52.998
because of Obama.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.666
Yeah, you want a Band-Aid?

08:54.668 --> 08:57.335
No problem, turkey.
Come on down to Obama-Mart!

08:57.337 --> 08:59.838
The price is free,
but yo ass better vote for me.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.806
Ha! Political
with a twist.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.174
It's funny from the news!

09:03.176 --> 09:05.343
What's going on in here?
You gotta check this out!

09:05.345 --> 09:06.611
It's Robin Williams!

09:06.613 --> 09:08.380
Ho-ho! A nurse
is a nurse, of curse.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.682
Up yours, Wilbur.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.050
Oh, my God!

09:12.052 --> 09:14.185
Everyone I touch
turns into Robin Williams!

09:14.187 --> 09:16.855
Yess! Peter Sweet Cheeks
Griffin-uh!

09:16.857 --> 09:19.457
You have been given
the power from god-uh!

09:19.459 --> 09:20.525
Ho-ho! Ho-ho!
Ho-ho!

09:20.527 --> 09:23.028
(laughing)

09:23.030 --> 09:25.997
I will be so responsible
with this.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.299
Thanks, guys!

09:27.301 --> 09:28.833
Ho-ho!
Bye!

09:28.835 --> 09:30.702
See you, Peter!
Y'all come back now, y'hear?

09:30.704 --> 09:32.137
(chuckles)
It's <i>Patch Adams</i> Robin.

09:32.139 --> 09:35.073
He cures stuff the fun way,
not the medicine way.

09:38.044 --> 09:40.612
So, somehow the lightning
gave your dad

09:40.614 --> 09:43.381
the power to turn anyone
I touch into Robin Williams.

09:43.383 --> 09:46.151
Peter, did Dr. Hartman say
how long this was gonna last?

09:46.153 --> 09:47.819
There is no more
Dr. Hartman, Lois.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.454
He's Robin Williams now.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.089
Bet you kids never thought
your dad

09:51.091 --> 09:53.124
would have superpowers, huh?

09:53.126 --> 09:55.994
Peter!
Ho-ho!
You pat my back, I pat yours,

09:55.996 --> 09:57.429
and Pat Robertson
pats Mr. Happy.

09:57.431 --> 10:00.131
(Southern accent):
Yayuss! Praise Jesus
with your Visa card!

10:00.133 --> 10:01.967
Max it out
on the Lord, people!

10:01.969 --> 10:03.101
Oh, boy!

10:03.103 --> 10:05.370
And that's the second
Southern preacher one.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.972
Look, Brian! Meg is
one of the sensitive,

10:06.974 --> 10:08.873
bearded Robin Williams
characters.

10:08.875 --> 10:09.941
Ha!

10:09.943 --> 10:11.876
You think that's
funny, chief?
Well, I...

10:11.878 --> 10:13.178
My wife is dead.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.280
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.115
She's dead, chief.
Ho-ho! Dead.

do not take the brown acid.

It's about the little penis
that could.

19:54.127 --> 19:56.127
It thinks it can, it thinks...

19:56.129 --> 19:57.929
In fact, it's pretty sure
it can.

19:57.931 --> 19:59.463
It-It, it's gonna.

19:59.465 --> 20:01.132
Hey, am I gonna have
to handle this?

20:01.134 --> 20:02.500
Do you want me
to handle this?

20:02.502 --> 20:03.601
Peter, just go wait
in the bedroom.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.002
I'll be right there.

20:05.004 --> 20:08.940
Fine, but if I gotta pee first,
this night's gonna be ruined.

20:08.942 --> 20:10.441
Ruined.

20:13.979 --> 20:16.214
Good night, sweetie.
Mommy loves you.

20:20.352 --> 20:22.954
(Stewie yawns)

20:22.956 --> 20:24.755
(rhythmic thudding)

20:24.757 --> 20:26.357
Huh?

20:29.194 --> 20:31.095
(both grunting)

20:32.264 --> 20:34.031
It's big, isn't it?

20:34.033 --> 20:36.167
Yes, Peter.
It's very big.

20:36.169 --> 20:39.971
Yeah, it's big.

20:39.973 --> 20:42.206
Oh, God, yes!

20:42.208 --> 20:44.208
Ah, yes...

20:44.210 --> 20:46.611
Ah, yeah.

20:48.614 --> 20:50.448
Oh, you're gonna use
that thing, good.
I love you so much.
