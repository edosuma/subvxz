WEBVTT

00:09.467 --> 00:11.053
[Frank] If we give him what he wants...

00:11.136 --> 00:15.182
If we give Usher what he says,
his justice, that is it.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.267
It's over. He owns us.

00:17.350 --> 00:20.228
-Don't exaggerate.
-I wish I were.

00:20.312 --> 00:23.440
-You've made a thousand deals.
-Yeah, well, this one is different.

00:23.523 --> 00:26.484
-Why?
-Because I can feel it right here.

00:26.569 --> 00:28.821
-Do you hear yourself?
-Yeah, loud and clear.

00:28.904 --> 00:32.866
I'm a little confused
that you don't seem to hear me at all.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.868
Once we're solidly back in power,

00:34.952 --> 00:36.870
-we will regain our position--
-That is naive.

00:36.954 --> 00:38.872
Naive is new for you.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.749
Realistic. Not naive.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.960
Everything we've worked for,
we can kiss it goodbye.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.503
We agreed to Usher's pick.
It's non-negotiable.

00:45.588 --> 00:49.341
That's exactly right.
It's his pick. It's his justice.

00:49.424 --> 00:52.595
He's trying to control our house.
The White House.

00:52.678 --> 00:55.055
I gave him my word, Francis.

00:56.431 --> 00:57.432
Your word?

00:58.559 --> 01:02.187
Your word? This conversation is pointless.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.521
Grow up!

01:04.815 --> 01:05.816
Who do you think you are?

01:05.899 --> 01:09.527
I think I am a temporary president
trying to get you back in office.

01:09.612 --> 01:12.615
And if you don't think that
we're at a critical juncture in the road,

01:12.698 --> 01:15.075
you are pathetically mistaken.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.620
Wake up, Claire! Wake up!

01:26.628 --> 01:29.548
[theme music playing]

03:05.560 --> 03:07.312
[indistinct chatter]

03:13.902 --> 03:17.865
Recorded this morning EET
in the Yarmouk neighborhood of Damascus.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.998
Seems he developed a taste for chocolate
while at Cambridge.

03:27.249 --> 03:30.919
Smiling for the camera is Ahmed Al Ahmadi,
Yusuf's brother.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.297
[Claire] Are you sure?

03:34.381 --> 03:39.094
I had a long conversation with
Yusuf Al Ahmadi. They look nothing alike.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.303
It's him.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.224
Is Ahmed still in our sights?

03:44.307 --> 03:46.894
-He is.
-This is a rare opportunity.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.937
We should seize the moment
and make a targeted strike.

03:49.021 --> 03:50.898
-Director, please.
-Madam President...

03:50.981 --> 03:53.608
Is there some issue, General?

03:57.029 --> 03:59.114
Ahmed Al Ahmadi didn't travel all the way

03:59.197 --> 04:01.658
from his compound to Damascus
to buy a candy bar.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.786
He's meeting with someone.
Let's find out who.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.997
Unless we're detected,
and he disappears for good.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.542
But if we wait, there's a huge potential
to learn more about ICO.

04:10.625 --> 04:13.628
Its members, contacts, habits, tactics.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.298
You know, you're sounding
uncharacteristically dovish

04:17.382 --> 04:18.759
this morning, General.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.096
I agree with General Braegher.

04:23.180 --> 04:26.016
While a successful air strike
against Ahmadi

04:26.099 --> 04:28.268
-would play well--
-This isn't about the election, Cathy.

04:29.227 --> 04:32.439
No, of course not.
I mean, if we do this correctly,

04:32.522 --> 04:35.317
we can begin the process
of dismantling ICO's network.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.318
Take him out.

04:37.861 --> 04:41.824
If the president agrees, I think
it's the best thing for the country.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.493
Well, I think it would send
a very clear message to ICO.

04:45.577 --> 04:49.664
-In the short term, yes, but--
-No other term is relevant.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.922
I think we have been operating
under the shadow of terror for too long.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.757
For the sake of the American people,
we need to act now.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.134
What's the timetable, General?

05:01.927 --> 05:04.972
[sighs] For an actionable location,
most likely a number of hours.

05:05.597 --> 05:06.639
Thank you.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.019
You're wasting our time.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.480
We're being selective
about where and how he appears.

05:13.563 --> 05:14.815
Soon he won't be at any events at all.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.234
We're just trying to land him
and you in the White House.

05:17.317 --> 05:21.613
And it's not Brockhart-Conway, Mark.
It's the opposite.

05:21.696 --> 05:22.697
[cell phone ringing]

05:22.780 --> 05:25.533
-He won't put up with this much longer.
-I'm sure it's hard on him.

05:25.617 --> 05:28.703
-I have to take this. I'm sorry.
-What happens after he gets there?

05:28.786 --> 05:32.040
-To Will? What happens?
-We'll be there for him.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.126
-You and General Brockhart?
-Yes.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.462
What will Will's role be?

05:39.172 --> 05:41.174
I will continue to support your husband.

05:41.258 --> 05:44.802
Give me a real answer. You owe me that.

05:45.803 --> 05:49.057
His role will be
President of the United States.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.060
[sighs]

05:53.645 --> 05:54.854
[Mark] Hey.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.692
The mic was still hot
and Brockhart just kept talking.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.861
-That's what she said.
-Insubordination?

06:02.862 --> 06:05.657
-That's the word she used?
-It's what it sounded like to her.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.994
He was talking about soldiers
and he said, quote,

06:09.077 --> 06:11.329
"I'll be the first to tell them
not to listen."

06:11.413 --> 06:14.457
-Can she get her hands on the actual clip?
-For a price.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.626
-I thought she was a friend.
-Yeah, a smart friend.

06:16.709 --> 06:20.505
-It's a nice 30-second spot, post-debate.
-If there is a debate.

06:22.132 --> 06:25.802
Hits them at their strength.
Takes the military credibility away.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.889
This is the kind of thing
that can turn an election.

06:31.808 --> 06:36.271
Whatever this costs... it's worth it.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.318
Let's secure it and then verify it.

06:44.988 --> 06:48.033
Recess appointment of Judge Benson or no,

06:48.116 --> 06:51.786
people need to stay focused
on the revote in Tennessee and Ohio

06:51.869 --> 06:53.121
and how the hell we got here.

06:53.830 --> 06:54.831
All right.

06:55.748 --> 06:58.168
I'll have my assistant Angela reach out

06:58.251 --> 07:00.753
to confirm what time
you need me at the studio.

07:01.671 --> 07:05.175
All right. Yep. Yeah.

07:07.885 --> 07:11.306
I collected everything I could find
about the day Doug Stamper was carjacked.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.890
[sighs] Good.

07:12.975 --> 07:14.642
All right, so...

07:16.228 --> 07:17.562
where was that?

07:19.814 --> 07:21.274
Where that happened?

07:22.567 --> 07:24.069
In Maryland.

07:25.070 --> 07:29.116
[inhales deeply] Right around, um...

07:29.199 --> 07:32.160
Yeah, I grew up
about a half an hour from there...

07:32.244 --> 07:34.121
It's here.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.459
And Rachel Posner's...

07:40.877 --> 07:43.588
last known address.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.898
[Angela] I'd say they were
about 15 minutes apart.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.491
I'm not sure why I need
to explain myself to you.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.825
Why would you go to the NSA?

08:12.909 --> 08:16.746
I was inquiring into the well-being
of an American citizen.

08:17.330 --> 08:21.626
-He's just a disgruntled hacker.
-Then why are you so interested in him?

08:24.504 --> 08:25.588
How did he look?

08:26.423 --> 08:27.882
I'm asking for me.

08:27.965 --> 08:32.054
I've known Aidan since I was 13 years old.
He and my mom dated for several years.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.304
Was a long time ago, obviously.

08:33.388 --> 08:36.224
But as far as the NSA job,
he didn't want it.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.767
I made him take it.

08:39.519 --> 08:43.940
I don't understand how they got him
or why he's there.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.109
I need to know that he is safe.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.653
He looked fine.

08:51.073 --> 08:52.657
What does he know, LeAnn?

08:53.575 --> 08:55.368
Probably about the same as you and me,

08:55.452 --> 08:59.039
which is why we need to keep him
out of any serious trouble.

09:04.836 --> 09:08.090
I don't want to get involved
in your personal life, LeAnn.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.384
-I'm here to see the president.
-Of course.

09:11.468 --> 09:14.471
But when you think about it, Cathy,
we're all sort of involved here.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.683
If he is in any kind of danger,
he is not built for it.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.017
Hi, Cathy.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.979
[gasps] Jane.

09:24.856 --> 09:28.025
LeAnn Harvey, Jane Davis.
Jane is under secretary--

09:28.110 --> 09:32.739
Deputy under secretary of commerce
for international trade. It's a mouthful.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.116
Yeah, it's good to put a face
to the voice.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.993
Uh, do you have any ibuprofen?

09:37.077 --> 09:38.953
-Oh, I might have some aspirin.
-No.

09:40.122 --> 09:42.999
-I'm allergic. Gives me hives.
-We may have some.

09:45.377 --> 09:48.838
You're the Harveys
of the tire company, yes?

09:51.341 --> 09:54.719
My father and uncle
sold the business 20 years ago.

09:54.802 --> 09:56.638
And the treads
haven't been the same since.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.098
[chuckles]

09:59.474 --> 10:01.934
But it's great. You finally landed in D.C.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.771
I'll let the president know
you're both here.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.523
Uh, thank you for this.

10:08.566 --> 10:09.859
[knocking on door]

10:12.404 --> 10:16.574
Uh, let's just reverse those two sentences
and it's there. It's to the point.

10:17.575 --> 10:20.495
-Pithy.
-Yes, pithy.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.332
Your meeting is here.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.128
Thank you.

10:28.211 --> 10:31.256
And Justice Benson is en route
to the White House for the announcement.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.965
I'll have her wait in the Yellow Oval.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.927
Uh, great.
Can you send the others in, please?

10:36.010 --> 10:37.179
Of course.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.641
Is the former president meeting us
in the Rose Garden?

10:41.724 --> 10:43.310
Francis will not be there.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.020
He's not needed.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.111
Miss Davis.

10:54.696 --> 10:55.863
Secretary Durant.

10:58.074 --> 11:01.328
-It's been a long time.
-Yes, where was that?

11:01.411 --> 11:04.581
[sighs] A think tank in Aspen, early 2000.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.459
Oh, there was a lot of thinking
happening back then.

11:07.542 --> 11:10.420
-Mmm. I'm glad we put a stop to that.
-[chuckles]

11:10.503 --> 11:11.504
Please, have a seat.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.257
So, I've gone over the numbers

11:14.341 --> 11:17.219
of the proposed agreement
of steel with Beijing

11:17.302 --> 11:19.387
and I have a couple of questions for you.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.306
Madam President,
we need to evacuate you now.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.350
-What's going on?
-Please, Madam President. It's urgent.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.476
Ma'am.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.187
Where are you taking me?

11:28.271 --> 11:30.648
-We're moving you to the PEOC.
-Why?

11:30.732 --> 11:33.943
-They'll brief you down below, ma'am.
-Where's Francis?

11:55.798 --> 11:59.302
-Where's Doug Stamper? And Mr. Yates?
-We're following protocol, ma'am.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.221
National Security Advisor Cafferty
is on her way.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.683
-Ma'am?
-No, we'll wait for Francis.

12:05.767 --> 12:06.684
He'll meet you inside.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.728
We will wait for Francis. That's an order.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.647
-Madam President.
-Miss Cafferty, what's going on?

12:10.730 --> 12:11.898
Nothing's confirmed yet,

12:11.981 --> 12:14.651
but a truck carrying radioactive material
has gone missing.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.907
-Is this real?
-We have to talk to Green.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.659
[Cafferty] Let's head inside.

12:58.986 --> 13:00.071
Yes.

13:03.325 --> 13:05.618
[inhales deeply] Mmm-hmm.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.996
I see. Thank you.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.250
Homeland received word from CYBERCOM

13:13.335 --> 13:16.588
that a truck carrying
three cesium-137 irradiators

13:16.671 --> 13:17.797
missed two checkpoints.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.757
It was supposed to be
traveling from Atlanta

13:19.841 --> 13:21.884
back to the manufacturer in Baltimore.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.846
-Where do we think the truck is now?
-Truck's GPS is offline.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.389
How the hell
does a thing like that happen?

13:26.473 --> 13:28.558
-We'll have to reevaluate.
-You're damn right we will.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.184
But we need to make some decisions.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.854
We should notify Metro PD
and Virginia State Police.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.564
Are we gonna evacuate the public?

13:34.647 --> 13:37.233
No. Before we do anything, I wanna speak
to the head of counterterrorism.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.068
Get Assistant Director Green on the line.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.278
-Ma'am, Homeland is over--
-The president is right.

13:42.822 --> 13:43.865
Ma'am?

13:45.533 --> 13:46.784
This is President Underwood.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.995
[Green] <i>At this time,</i>
<i>we have no idea who's responsible.</i>

13:49.078 --> 13:51.998
Perhaps it's better I patch you
into the whole room. One second.

13:55.251 --> 13:58.295
<i>The driver's been unreachable</i>
<i>since his shift began.</i>

13:58.380 --> 14:02.049
<i>There's enough radiation on that truck</i>
<i>to impact a 30-mile radius.</i>

14:02.133 --> 14:04.469
<i>Even if it's not weaponized,</i>
<i>it would be in the air,</i>

14:04.552 --> 14:07.304
<i>in the water, children, people...</i>

14:08.305 --> 14:12.560
General, I can hear the wheels
grinding from here.

14:12.644 --> 14:14.311
I'd rather not speculate, sir.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.356
Oh, please do.

14:19.233 --> 14:22.487
Over the past several days,
there has been increased ICO chatter,

14:22.570 --> 14:24.280
but that is the new normal.

14:25.573 --> 14:29.160
[Green] <i>We've sent over stats and maps</i>
<i>of potentially affected areas.</i>

14:42.674 --> 14:45.552
I don't know what's worse.
A dirty bomb about to go off

14:45.635 --> 14:48.179
or what'll happen to the city
when they know we're looking for one.

14:48.262 --> 14:51.933
-Who do we have left upstairs?
-Seth and LeAnn.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.560
You stay in touch with Green.

14:54.477 --> 14:58.898
If this is a dirty bomb,
then we've just entered a different world.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.024
[Doug] Yes, sir.

15:01.484 --> 15:04.821
All right, we need to stay focused
on our contingency plan for an evacuation

15:04.904 --> 15:07.114
without the appearance of doing so.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.204
We need to be ready
to implement one way...

15:13.287 --> 15:15.206
We need to get the cleanup team
from the Energy...

15:15.289 --> 15:17.875
...whose jurisdiction it is
to get the security cams...

15:17.959 --> 15:19.627
[people speaking indistinctly]

15:21.045 --> 15:25.883
<i>Yes. Whenever it happens, this appointment</i>
<i>would break the court's deadlock.</i>

15:25.967 --> 15:28.260
<i>And we would get this election</i>
<i>going again.</i>

15:28.344 --> 15:30.555
<i>But let's step back a minute.</i>

15:30.638 --> 15:33.683
<i>Tennessee is out of the equation.</i>

15:33.766 --> 15:36.978
<i>Whoever wins that state, it's not enough.</i>

15:37.061 --> 15:40.815
<i>It's come down to one state. Ohio.</i>

15:41.524 --> 15:47.321
<i>One state is about to choose</i>
<i>the next President of these United States.</i>

15:47.404 --> 15:49.198
<i>How did we let this happen?</i>

15:49.782 --> 15:51.826
<i>And it keeps happening.</i>

15:51.909 --> 15:55.497
<i>This is an administration</i>
<i>that operates behind closed doors,</i>

15:55.580 --> 15:57.790
<i>out of the public eye.</i>

15:57.874 --> 16:03.004
<i>Today's sudden postponement is typical.</i>
<i>With no announcement in the Rose Garden,</i>

16:03.087 --> 16:06.508
<i>and literally zero news</i>
<i>coming from the White House,</i>

16:06.591 --> 16:09.426
<i>one has to wonder</i>
<i>what is going on behind the scenes</i>

16:09.511 --> 16:12.138
<i>to cause this unexpected delay.</i>

16:12.221 --> 16:14.932
<i>The silence is deafening.</i>

16:15.016 --> 16:20.229
<i>After such a protracted, confusing</i>
<i>and, frankly, chaotic election,</i>

16:20.312 --> 16:22.439
<i>we deserve clarity.</i>

16:22.524 --> 16:25.151
<i>Instead, here we are again...</i>

16:25.234 --> 16:28.738
<i>left out of the loop</i>
<i>and on the edge of our seats.</i>

16:28.821 --> 16:32.158
<i>I just hope America</i>
<i>isn't getting used to this.</i>

16:32.241 --> 16:33.660
[cell phone vibrating]

16:35.119 --> 16:37.705
-Hello?
-[Doug] <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

16:37.789 --> 16:38.956
Doug?

16:39.040 --> 16:40.332
<i>Why wasn't I read in?</i>

16:41.250 --> 16:43.711
-To what?
-Whatever's going on.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.714
If this is gonna play for us,
the president in the bunker,

16:46.798 --> 16:48.215
I need to know how to play it.

16:48.299 --> 16:51.511
There's a truck carrying
radioactive material that's gone missing.

16:52.595 --> 16:55.515
Okay.
Should Seth and I prepare a statement?

16:55.598 --> 16:58.475
-Where are we saying the truck is?
<i>-We don't know.</i>

16:59.393 --> 17:01.979
-When are we gonna find it?
-We don't know.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.692
<i>Wait, is something really happening?</i>

17:06.651 --> 17:07.694
Probably not.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.284
-Hello?
<i>-Probably not?</i>

17:15.367 --> 17:16.578
What am I supposed to do?

17:17.493 --> 17:18.704
-Is that Doug?
-Yeah.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.330
Can I talk to him?

17:20.414 --> 17:22.541
-Hey, what can you tell us?
<i>-Act normal.</i>

17:22.625 --> 17:25.712
Stay on point.
Comment only on the ongoing campaign.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.589
<i>I've already postponed</i>
<i>their scheduled events.</i>

17:27.672 --> 17:29.966
<i>Look, are we in danger here or what?</i>

17:30.967 --> 17:32.301
I can't answer.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.887
Because I don't know.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.932
<i>Await further instructions from Homeland.</i>

17:38.015 --> 17:39.016
All right.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.729
Doug, should we be here?

17:44.438 --> 17:45.439
He hung up.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.236
What are we doing?

17:59.536 --> 18:01.664
Nora thinks we need to notify
Speaker McCarthy.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.791
I think it's too soon
for a continuity of government.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.335
If we're planning an evacuation,
Congress needs to be notified--

18:06.418 --> 18:08.963
I said, I believe it is a bit too early.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.132
Madam President,
Director Morrison thinks that--

18:11.215 --> 18:12.800
Wait a minute.
Where is Director Morrison? Why--

18:12.884 --> 18:15.552
She opted to stay at ODNI.
She's monitoring from there.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.388
Well, at least let's get her on the phone.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.390
We should have wiped out ICO
when we had the chance.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.059
[Frank] We didn't ask
for your personal opinion, General.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.022
What we need is an update
on the Ahmed Al Ahmadi situation.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.149
Yes, ma'am.
I'll check with Director Morrison now.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.367
I have contacts, you know.

18:39.451 --> 18:42.371
Private contractors in the region
that might be of help.

18:42.454 --> 18:46.751
Are you suggesting that your contacts
know more than the Bureau, the NSA--

18:46.834 --> 18:48.502
I'm not suggesting anything.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.255
I'm telling you.

18:51.339 --> 18:54.508
I know third parties
that have negotiated with ICO in the past.

18:56.052 --> 18:59.639
Hostages and whatnot...
who may know something.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.307
[whispering] But I need a line.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.727
Just a... a secure one.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.857
[softly] I can barely breathe in here.

19:11.025 --> 19:13.402
I'm gonna go get us a cup of coffee.

19:19.867 --> 19:23.079
How does Miss Davis have
this level of clearance?

19:25.581 --> 19:27.041
That's a good question.

19:36.801 --> 19:39.220
-Did we bring this on ourselves?
-What?

19:40.596 --> 19:42.556
-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.
-Listen to me.

19:42.639 --> 19:46.811
Everything we've done, everything,
is exactly what we had to do.

19:48.980 --> 19:51.065
We don't even know if this is real.

20:22.764 --> 20:24.431
[Davis] I get these in Hong Kong.

20:25.767 --> 20:29.061
The best instant coffee
comes out of the Pacific Rim.

20:32.356 --> 20:35.026
-Would you like one?
-If you can spare it.

20:35.943 --> 20:38.237
Oh, I always have
three or four in my bag.

20:44.701 --> 20:47.163
[Davis sighs] I wonder how long
we'll be down here.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.874
[Doug] The situation's still unclear.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.838
[Davis] I shouldn't be drinking coffee.
I still feel a little shaky.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.423
[Davis inhales deeply]

20:57.924 --> 20:59.050
[exhales]

21:00.467 --> 21:01.761
You don't look it.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.522
Feel my pulse.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.863
You seem very much in control to me.

21:27.829 --> 21:29.038
So do you.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.042
What does that say about the two of us?

21:46.848 --> 21:47.974
Hmm.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.399
[General Braegher] Yes, thank you.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.777
The SEAL team is on the trail
of Ahmed Al Ahmadi,

22:00.862 --> 22:04.198
but National Intelligence believes
he's discovered we're following him

22:04.281 --> 22:06.408
and the truck is a countermeasure.

22:06.492 --> 22:10.121
ICO wants to see Ahmadi
walking out of Damascus in one piece.

22:10.204 --> 22:12.373
If we strike, they will hit back.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.250
[Cafferty] Evacuation procedures
need to be initiated--

22:14.333 --> 22:16.002
-Just hold on!
-No, the public is our priority--

22:16.085 --> 22:18.420
Hold on! I want to know
how close we are to a strike

22:18.504 --> 22:21.423
and where this goddamn truck is
before we make any final decisions.

22:21.507 --> 22:24.426
-"We make any decisions"?
-Yes, I am still in a position to make--

22:24.510 --> 22:26.845
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but you are not in a position--

22:26.929 --> 22:29.974
Nora. The enemy isn't in here.

22:36.188 --> 22:40.692
Cafferty is right. We should evacuate.
But it's the general who's on my mind.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.279
Miss Cafferty.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.657
I was entirely out of line.
Please accept my apology.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.205
[Doug] <i>I spoke with Davis.</i>

22:53.289 --> 22:56.625
-And?
-Nothing. She was just flexing.

22:59.753 --> 23:00.922
[Frank] Cathy.

23:08.720 --> 23:13.350
Who called a meeting with Claire today?
You or Miss Davis?

23:13.434 --> 23:14.518
Jane did.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.021
Thank you very much, Cathy.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.689
-Was that all?
-Yes, thank you.

23:19.648 --> 23:20.983
Oh, sorry, one more thing.

23:21.067 --> 23:25.154
When did Braegher get his fourth star?
Which administration?

23:25.237 --> 23:26.863
A couple back.

23:26.948 --> 23:28.699
So he and Brockhart together?

23:29.408 --> 23:32.286
And a few others who were elevated
around the same time, yes.

23:32.954 --> 23:34.121
Thank you, Cathy.

23:40.877 --> 23:43.547
That Brockhart spot we talked about.
You have it?

23:44.548 --> 23:45.674
Is it verified?

23:46.592 --> 23:48.135
Hold on.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.391
-[cell phone beeps]
-Ready.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.436
[Brockhart on recording] <i>I swear to God,</i>

23:57.519 --> 23:59.230
<i>if Underwood puts soldiers</i>
<i>on those borders,</i>

23:59.313 --> 24:01.565
<i>I'll be the first to tell them</i>
<i>not to listen.</i>

24:01.648 --> 24:04.776
<i>If the President of the United States</i>
<i>gives orders like that,</i>

24:04.860 --> 24:06.612
<i>you put him out of his misery.</i>

24:06.695 --> 24:08.489
[LeAnn] <i>That's it. That's all I have.</i>

24:09.490 --> 24:11.367
No, that's good.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.994
<i>If we survive the day.</i>

24:13.077 --> 24:14.996
<i>Is Seth still in the office with you?</i>

24:15.079 --> 24:18.790
I'm in the Oval,
sitting behind the Resolute desk.

24:18.874 --> 24:21.293
[chuckles] <i>That's not you.</i>

24:21.377 --> 24:26.132
You know, you keep deciding who I am
and you keep reading me wrong.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.550
<i>Are there rumors</i>
<i>about what's going on down here?</i>

24:28.634 --> 24:30.677
Yes, but we're deflecting.

24:30.761 --> 24:33.930
-Has the Conway campaign reached out?
<i>-Not yet.</i>

24:34.015 --> 24:37.726
The general's on a stump in Ohio
and the governor's off the grid.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.937
<i>-Okay. Stay on him.</i>
-I will.

24:41.022 --> 24:43.857
Unless it's the end of the world
and it doesn't matter.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.069
Goodbye, Doug Stamper.

24:52.783 --> 24:55.577
Are you sure
you should be in there, Goldilocks?

24:59.456 --> 25:01.292
[Davis speaking Arabic]

25:32.656 --> 25:35.367
-[Davis sighs]
-[knocks on door]

25:35.951 --> 25:37.078
Are you all right?

25:39.663 --> 25:42.749
Honestly, I was thinking about
how far down we are

25:42.833 --> 25:44.251
and how it's not my favorite thing.

25:46.087 --> 25:48.130
I... I'm sorry.
Do... do you need to be in here?

25:48.214 --> 25:49.506
No. No, no. It's fine.

25:50.966 --> 25:53.594
I used to have a fear of flying,
but I got over it.

25:54.511 --> 25:56.430
Doesn't bother me at all anymore.

25:57.431 --> 26:00.392
But the pendulum seems
to have swung the other way.

26:01.102 --> 26:03.812
If I think too hard,
I start to feel buried.

26:03.895 --> 26:07.399
Forgive me. It's the recirculated air,
makes things worse.

26:10.319 --> 26:13.447
Miss Davis, why are you here?

26:13.530 --> 26:15.907
-This is where the Secret Service led me.
-No.

26:16.533 --> 26:19.953
Access list or not,
you have to choose to be here.

26:20.036 --> 26:23.249
-I always choose the safest place.
-Why are you here?

26:26.001 --> 26:28.170
It felt like an opportunity.

26:28.754 --> 26:31.632
A chance for a meeting,
not quite on the books.

26:31.715 --> 26:34.760
I just got off the phone, Madam President.

26:34.843 --> 26:38.180
I have information from abroad,
from private contractors...

26:38.264 --> 26:40.641
Ahmadi is in Damascus.

26:40.724 --> 26:44.102
And a number of parties
were racing to capture him,

26:44.186 --> 26:46.730
including, of course, the United States.

26:46.813 --> 26:48.190
But no one...

26:49.275 --> 26:51.818
will be capturing him today.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.363
Or before the election.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.032
I've made a career...

26:58.033 --> 27:00.786
out of dealing with
problematic parts of the world.

27:04.039 --> 27:08.585
It's kind of my vocation
to imagine the unimaginable.

27:13.340 --> 27:14.508
Excuse me.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.225
-Pardon me.
-I'm sorry.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.352
-It's all right.
-Excuse me, Mr. President.

27:31.608 --> 27:35.529
I had the distinct feeling
she was offering Ahmadi to us.

27:35.612 --> 27:36.780
Meaning?

27:36.863 --> 27:39.533
She said there are a number of groups
looking to capture him,

27:39.616 --> 27:43.495
but that no one will.
Not today or before the election.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.873
We brought this on ourselves.

27:47.791 --> 27:50.211
-We pushed too hard.
-We've survived.

27:50.294 --> 27:53.464
-We isolated ourselves, Francis.
-So what?

27:53.547 --> 27:56.425
We both know something the rest
of the world refuses to acknowledge.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.595
There is no justice, only conquest.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.264
And let me tell you,
we let them evacuate D.C.,

28:02.348 --> 28:04.850
we are done, Claire. We've lost.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.435
-[knocking on door]
-Yes?

28:10.856 --> 28:14.443
I just spoke to LeAnn.
You need to hear this.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.902
[Brockhart] <i>I swear to God,</i>

28:15.986 --> 28:17.738
<i>if Underwood puts soldiers</i>
<i>on those borders,</i>

28:17.821 --> 28:19.948
<i>I'll be the first to tell them</i>

28:23.118 --> 28:24.786

28:31.293 --> 28:32.294
Let me out.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.796
-I'm sorry, sir. I'm not allowed--
-Open the door.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.173
-My orders are to--
-I am no longer the president.

28:37.258 --> 28:40.427
I have no responsibilities or obligations.
Isn't that correct?

28:40.511 --> 28:42.221
We can't send you above
until the threat is contained--

28:42.304 --> 28:45.181
-Open this door.
-Let him out.

28:45.266 --> 28:47.893
-Ma'am?
-Let the president out.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.230
Open the door.

28:54.107 --> 28:55.108
[man] Open it.

30:02.718 --> 30:03.719
[sighs]

30:12.102 --> 30:13.645
[all speaking indistinctly]

30:21.445 --> 30:23.113
Ma'am.

30:23.196 --> 30:28.076
-We need to initiate evacuation now.
-No, General. We'll do it when I say so.

30:35.208 --> 30:36.460
I'm really sorry.

30:36.543 --> 30:39.546
I know I agreed to do this,
but I have to go pick up my kids.

30:40.130 --> 30:42.173
Okay. Well, what if
I just rode in the car with you?

30:42.257 --> 30:44.134
You know, parents are texting one another.

30:44.217 --> 30:48.472
One of them works at the NSA and
he thinks there's a terror threat, so...

30:48.555 --> 30:51.767
I mean, this has happened before,
but you just... You never know.

30:51.850 --> 30:55.103
My mom died of kidney failure last month.

30:55.186 --> 30:57.272
Oh, I'm so sorry.

30:58.482 --> 31:02.611
-Uh, was she on the donor list?
-Yeah, but not close enough to the top.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.782
Do you mind?
You could talk while we walk out of here.

31:07.991 --> 31:10.869
Um... sure. Yeah.

31:12.078 --> 31:15.081
-[cell phone beeps]
-Uh, how long was Anthony sick for?

31:15.999 --> 31:19.628
Uh... about two years.

31:21.547 --> 31:25.592
And he fought it hard.
So hard. The entire way.

31:28.970 --> 31:33.559
This unit, if they pay cash,
I don't ask questions.

31:33.642 --> 31:36.603
-But you remember these young women?
-Yeah, of course.

31:36.687 --> 31:40.023
They were very close,
if you know what I mean.

31:40.106 --> 31:41.692
But they were sweet.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.655
And did you ever see... this man?

31:48.782 --> 31:50.701
Look, I don't know what was going on here.

31:50.784 --> 31:52.453
But you recognize him?

31:54.413 --> 31:56.832
Yeah. Okay?

31:56.915 --> 32:00.836
Someone looking like him paid the rent.
Three months, up-front.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.046
But like I said, I don't judge.

32:08.885 --> 32:12.013
I'm not sure what you're asking,
Mr. President.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.474
Oh, please.

32:14.641 --> 32:17.853
Someone or someones...

32:17.936 --> 32:20.439
tried to make my wife and I
lose the election

32:20.522 --> 32:23.191
by keeping us underground today.

32:23.274 --> 32:26.612
And I would like to know
what you know about that.

32:26.695 --> 32:30.907
We've all been responding in real time
to a potential terrorist attack.

32:30.991 --> 32:34.536
But you chose to stay here.
Why weren't you in the bunker with us?

32:34.620 --> 32:36.830
I chose to remain in my office

32:36.913 --> 32:39.750
to oversee the capture
or killing of one Ahmed Al Ahmadi.

32:40.333 --> 32:41.334
Mmm.

32:41.417 --> 32:43.629
And yet there was great tension
this morning

32:43.712 --> 32:45.421
between you and General Braegher.

32:45.506 --> 32:47.257
Difference in approach.

32:47.841 --> 32:50.844
We are not going to evacuate
the District of Columbia.

32:50.927 --> 32:54.347
I want you to understand that.
Come what may.

32:56.767 --> 33:00.646
And I promise you this... Vanessa.

33:02.105 --> 33:07.611
When I find out exactly what has happened,
I'm going to remember this conversation,

33:07.694 --> 33:10.489
when you chose to withhold information.

33:11.865 --> 33:16.327
General Braegher is a strong supporter
of General Brockhart.

33:20.415 --> 33:21.958
Did they conspire?

33:26.379 --> 33:30.466
Did they use... terror...

33:30.551 --> 33:36.347
and this evacuation
to cost me this election?

33:37.516 --> 33:40.060
I'm not a fan of the general...

33:41.436 --> 33:45.816
but... that's a strong charge,
and there's no proof to support it.

33:46.900 --> 33:51.279
[chuckles] You know, what you people
protect best is each other.

33:51.863 --> 33:57.118
We lost Ahmadi a short time ago
and believe he is no longer in Damascus.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.789
[scoffs] Of course.

34:02.415 --> 34:03.750
Of course.

34:09.339 --> 34:10.924
Now you listen to me...

34:12.467 --> 34:18.014
This was nothing more or less
than an attempted coup, plain and simple.

34:18.681 --> 34:22.936
And I do not know to what degree
you have been directly involved.

34:23.018 --> 34:25.731
But you will resolve it.

34:26.522 --> 34:27.608
Now.

34:29.275 --> 34:31.277
Do I make myself clear?

34:34.822 --> 34:36.116
Yes, sir.

34:39.870 --> 34:42.205
[door opens and closes]

34:43.164 --> 34:44.415
[sighs]

34:50.420 --> 34:52.924
The truck's been found. [sighs]

34:53.007 --> 34:56.594
Now we can't know for sure, but it looks
as though ICO wasn't involved.

34:56.678 --> 34:59.097
The irradiators and cesium
were accounted for.

34:59.180 --> 35:03.727
The truck was accidentally parked
at a medical device factory in Durham.

35:03.810 --> 35:06.396
The plant foreman never reported it.

35:06.479 --> 35:08.899
So we can relax for now, at least.

35:08.982 --> 35:11.652
I just wanna thank you all
for your efforts. Thank you.

35:16.114 --> 35:19.575
Madam President.
You'll have my resignation in the morning.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.161
Nora...

35:22.287 --> 35:24.748
these were extraordinary
circumstances today.

35:24.831 --> 35:29.127
What would our administration be if
we didn't allow for some human failings?

35:37.678 --> 35:40.221
Get the presser going.
We're coming up now.

35:40.305 --> 35:42.223
Concerning Ahmadi...

35:43.141 --> 35:44.893
We didn't find him.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.020
You will. You can.

35:47.103 --> 35:50.065
-What are you offering?
-Help.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.693
If you'd like it, Madam President.

36:00.951 --> 36:03.662
[reporter] Can you elaborate
on the drill earlier today?

36:03.745 --> 36:05.413
Well, drills happen all the time.

36:05.496 --> 36:08.416
It's part of the administration's
ongoing efforts to keep the country safe.

36:08.499 --> 36:11.252
-Yes, but there's usually a warning.
-What's the point of that?

36:12.545 --> 36:14.798
-Who's next?
-[reporters clamoring]

36:27.393 --> 36:28.895
Did you look at the file?

36:30.105 --> 36:31.231
I didn't have to.

36:33.524 --> 36:37.653
I'll expect your signature
on the resignation letter within the hour.

36:39.239 --> 36:42.492
Unless you choose to implicate
whoever else was involved.

36:52.085 --> 36:54.587
You don't deserve to be
in the White House.

36:55.964 --> 36:57.799
Neither you nor your husband.

37:03.805 --> 37:06.266
I'd wish you the best,
but I don't think you'll need it.

37:06.349 --> 37:09.895
I'm fairly certain you'll do very well
in the private sector.

37:18.236 --> 37:21.156
I've scheduled a meeting with Jane Davis
for the end of the week.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.240
Good.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.075
Also, I was going to mention this earlier,

37:24.159 --> 37:28.079
but Cathy's been very curious
about Aidan Macallan.

37:28.163 --> 37:30.040
I've thrown her off the scent, but...

37:30.123 --> 37:34.127
Cathy's not the problem.
The problem is Macallan,

37:34.210 --> 37:37.422
and the person who allowed Macallan
to become the problem.

37:42.593 --> 37:45.555
The foundation's raised over 80K.

37:45.638 --> 37:49.309
Anthony became status one
on the donor list on March 15th, 2016.

37:49.392 --> 37:52.270
Moretti talked about it as, uh,
the last day of her life

37:52.353 --> 37:53.438
before she corrected herself.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.065
Spent every spare second
with the kids.

37:55.148 --> 37:57.442
They were building a go-kart.
They were pretty close to done.

37:57.525 --> 37:58.526
-Okay.
-I got more.

37:58.609 --> 38:00.904
-No, I got it.
-What were you looking for?

38:00.987 --> 38:02.322
It's nothing.

38:06.076 --> 38:08.286
-Okay.
-What?

38:08.369 --> 38:10.538
You wanna tell me what happened
in the White House today?

38:10.621 --> 38:13.208
-No, I don't.
-[scoffs]

38:16.837 --> 38:17.921
[sighs]

38:20.924 --> 38:22.550
All right,
I've been waiting to say something,

38:22.633 --> 38:25.053
but I've waited
and I don't want to wait anymore.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.931
Consider me for a job at the White House,
in comms.

38:31.267 --> 38:34.354
"Go get this. Find me that.
I need this." I'm tired of it.

38:34.437 --> 38:37.023
If you don't ask, you get asked.
That's what I'm starting to realize.

38:37.107 --> 38:38.191
I'll put a word in.

38:38.691 --> 38:39.775
Yeah? Well, what does that mean?

38:39.860 --> 38:42.487
It means that when the moment is right,
I'll mention you.

38:47.575 --> 38:50.203
<i>Yes, whenever it happens...</i>

38:50.286 --> 38:52.956
<i>this appointment would break</i>
<i>the court's deadlock</i>

38:53.039 --> 38:55.375
<i>and we would get this election</i>
<i>going again.</i>

38:55.458 --> 38:57.836
<i>-But let's step back a minute...</i>
-[Doug sighs]

38:57.919 --> 39:00.255
<i>-Tennessee...</i>
-Where's your salt?

39:00.839 --> 39:03.424
<i>-Whoever wins that state...</i>
-Right side of the sink.

39:04.217 --> 39:07.262
<i>It's come down to one state:</i>

39:07.345 --> 39:08.471
<i>Ohio.</i>

39:08.555 --> 39:13.601
<i>One state is about to choose</i>
<i>the next President of these United States.</i>

39:13.726 --> 39:16.312
-Was it really a drill?
-Hmm.

39:16.396 --> 39:19.941
<i>This is an administration</i>
<i>that operates behind closed doors.</i>

39:20.066 --> 39:22.527
You know, with everything
that was happening today,

39:22.610 --> 39:24.863
this reporter from the <i>Herald</i> came by.

39:25.780 --> 39:26.865
What?

39:26.948 --> 39:29.659
Wants to do a story on Tony
and the foundation.

39:35.498 --> 39:36.624
What was his name?

40:04.402 --> 40:07.322
Davis implied she could help us
track down Ahmadi.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.075
I think we should hear
what she has to say.

40:11.534 --> 40:14.120
She's got a quality about her,
doesn't she?

40:15.038 --> 40:17.248
Attractive and terrifying.

40:18.458 --> 40:21.586
Like the urge to pet a red tail fox.

40:26.591 --> 40:29.010
The general offered his letter?

40:29.094 --> 40:33.056
Uh, he did.
And refused to implicate anyone.

40:36.809 --> 40:40.605
You were right, Claire.
We need to sit down with Usher.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.986
Just so happens, he's going to
Northern California this weekend

40:46.069 --> 40:49.155
to meet with a group of men

40:49.239 --> 40:52.951
to discuss the crisis
and the future of our country.

40:53.034 --> 40:56.746
-Well, you need to be invited to that.
-Yes, let's get him in.

41:01.334 --> 41:04.712
[sighs] I know it's obvious,
but it always strikes me.

41:04.795 --> 41:05.921
No women.

41:07.215 --> 41:09.217
Well, it was a different time.

41:12.012 --> 41:13.304
Terrible.

41:13.388 --> 41:16.599
The war or the restrictions of the era?

41:17.517 --> 41:18.726
Both.

41:18.809 --> 41:20.895
Well, you know my position.

41:21.812 --> 41:24.065
I'm all for women in combat.

41:50.716 --> 41:51.926
[sighs]

42:18.411 --> 42:20.121
[breathes deeply]

43:07.543 --> 43:10.296
False alarm... hmm?

43:16.302 --> 43:17.970
I was worried about you.

43:32.318 --> 43:33.528
[Yates sighs]

43:40.493 --> 43:42.828
I worry about you all the time, Claire.

43:48.251 --> 43:51.671
But I know that's not the kind of thing
you like to hear.

44:05.476 --> 44:06.519
[Yates sighs]

44:08.604 --> 44:10.064
[knocking on door]

44:12.900 --> 44:15.486
Mark. Come in.

44:16.404 --> 44:18.573
-We have much to discuss.
-Madam President.

44:19.490 --> 44:21.367
Uh, Mr. President.

44:22.117 --> 44:23.661
As I believe you know,

44:23.744 --> 44:27.957
yesterday we had something of a drill
here in the White House.

44:28.040 --> 44:30.460
I know people are wondering
what that was about.

44:30.543 --> 44:33.003
Yes. Everyone except you.

44:33.921 --> 44:36.257
The announcement of the recess
appointment of Judge Benson

44:36.341 --> 44:38.426
has been rescheduled
for tomorrow morning.

44:38.509 --> 44:40.261
Good. So...

44:41.679 --> 44:42.888
we have an election.

44:42.972 --> 44:47.977
Which you will not be able to win
with another so-called October surprise.

44:48.060 --> 44:52.232
-Well, we are way past October.
-We certainly are.

44:54.650 --> 44:56.861
I understand Ahmed Al Ahmadi
is still a threat?

44:57.445 --> 45:00.906
Yes, but he's so elusive, as you know.

45:00.990 --> 45:03.284
It's a shame you weren't able
to capture him.

45:03.368 --> 45:04.994
Well...

45:05.077 --> 45:09.624
I believe that the opportunity
will present itself to the next president,

45:09.707 --> 45:11.459
whomever he may be.

45:12.293 --> 45:14.044
[Mark] If Will Conway wins the office,

45:14.128 --> 45:16.464
I can assure you
that'll be a top priority.

45:16.547 --> 45:17.548
[Frank] Hmm.

45:18.466 --> 45:20.134
This terror has got to stop.

45:24.930 --> 45:26.682
I've taken enough of your time.

45:27.725 --> 45:32.272
Oh, Mark, I just want to play something
for you. It'll only take a moment.

45:33.606 --> 45:34.774
[Brockhart] <i>I swear to God,</i>

45:34.857 --> 45:36.817
<i>if Underwood puts soldiers</i>
<i>on those borders,</i>

45:36.901 --> 45:38.944
<i>I'll be the first to tell them</i>
<i>not to listen.</i>

45:39.028 --> 45:42.323
<i>If the President of the United States</i>
<i>gives orders like that,</i>

45:42.407 --> 45:43.324
<i>you put him out of his--</i>

45:43.408 --> 45:45.660
Okay. I don't need to hear anymore.

45:45.743 --> 45:47.161
[Frank] Oh, but, Mark...

45:47.244 --> 45:49.204
it gets so much better.
