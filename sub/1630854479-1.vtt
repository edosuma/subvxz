WEBVTT

00:50.520 --> 00:51.520
Breakfast!

00:54.000 --> 00:56.160
Charlie, you're gonna be late, mate.

00:57.960 --> 00:59.000
I'm cereal.

00:59.080 --> 00:59.960
I'm pancakes.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.600
Toast with jam, no butter.

01:01.680 --> 01:02.640
Toast and marmalade.

01:02.720 --> 01:05.800
Okay. Toast with, uh, jam, that's there.

01:05.880 --> 01:08.480
-And one cereal.
-Dad!

01:10.560 --> 01:13.320
-Buster. Buster, what… What's that?
-Lolly.

01:13.400 --> 01:16.080
-We don't have lollies for breakfast.
-Why?

01:16.160 --> 01:19.480
Why? Because I have made you
some lovely bacon.

01:19.560 --> 01:20.720
Well, I'm vegan now.

01:20.800 --> 01:21.680
Course you are.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.160
Lunch box, lunch box.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.840
No. Guys. No. Sorry.

01:27.920 --> 01:32.960
What've we said? We don't have hamsters
at the dinner table, do we? Thank you.

01:33.520 --> 01:34.680
All right, thank you.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.920
We've got about ten minutes left.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.040
I need you to get your coats,
your school bags, and let's go.

01:42.120 --> 01:43.200
Quick!

01:47.960 --> 01:49.520
Guys, we're gonna be late!

01:50.280 --> 01:51.400
Charlie, thank you.

01:52.160 --> 01:56.800
Rosie, don't forget your sandwich.
That's yours. Buster, come here.

01:56.880 --> 01:59.400
Look, just stay there.
Put your arm through there.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.600
Doesn't matter. Go. Here, take your hat.

02:02.360 --> 02:04.200
Buster, come… Where's your shoe?

02:04.760 --> 02:07.000
Buster! It doesn't matter. Go, quick.

02:07.080 --> 02:09.760
It's here! I've got it. I've got the shoe.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.800
-Ah, Mr. Cunningham.
-Yes.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.920
-I've got a parcel for you.
-Oh, thank you.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.400
-Sorry, I need you to sign.
-I don't have a pen.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.160
-I have a pencil.
-Ah, no, can't use pencil.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.320
-I've got a crayon.
-No, crayon's too waxy. Sorry.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.960
-A felt-tip.
-Gotta be black Biro.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.720
-I don't have a black Biro.
-I have.

02:29.080 --> 02:32.680
You can use that. You only had to ask.
That's it, and we just need the date

02:33.200 --> 02:34.120
of your birth.

02:35.760 --> 02:36.600
-Okay.
-Lovely.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.080
Oh, and we got to do a photo
for proof of delivery.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.560
Okay, kids. Here we go.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.280
That's it, kids. Nice big smile.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.400
And we're done.

02:45.920 --> 02:48.480
Lovely. Think you're gonna enjoy that.
And you, kids.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.640
Haven't read it though, haven't read it.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.880
All right, listen,
everyone get in the car. Thank you.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.160
Rosie, will you get the door, please?

03:30.840 --> 03:33.360
Dad, you forgot the costume
for the Christmas concert!

03:33.440 --> 03:35.120
I need a cake for the Christmas bake!

03:35.200 --> 03:37.120
You said you would do the reading with me.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.880
Don't your teachers do the reading?

03:38.960 --> 03:40.400
-I feel all wobbly.
-Off you go.

03:40.480 --> 03:43.000
-Quick as you can. Love you! Bye!
-Love you. Bye!

03:43.080 --> 03:45.200
Ooh, sorry. Morning, children.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.960
-Late again.
-Hello. Bye-bye! Okay, thank you.

03:49.320 --> 03:50.160
No!

03:50.960 --> 03:52.400
Not acceptable!

03:52.480 --> 03:56.560
So time is of the essence, people.
I need loyalty.

03:56.640 --> 03:59.760
I need people with no distractions.
I need commitment.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.800
I need 110% commitment.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.600
-How much commitment do I need?
-110% commitment.

04:05.680 --> 04:08.560
Oh, welcome! Thank you for joining us.
Do take a seat.

04:08.640 --> 04:11.000
Sorry, it was the school run.
You know kids.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.880
Really, was it? I don't care.

04:12.960 --> 04:16.320
I'm running a business,
and in business, kids don't count!

04:16.400 --> 04:17.840
Now, where was I?

04:17.920 --> 04:21.120
The Emblem deal
needs to be done by the end of the year.

04:21.200 --> 04:26.160
We want our pitch to outpitch
every other pitch out there. Woo!

04:26.800 --> 04:30.000
Cunningham. People seem to think
you have a certain charm.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.880
Therefore, you will present
the final pitch.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.880
Wait, sorry. When exactly
do you think that I would be pitching?

04:35.960 --> 04:38.600
I get very busy with the run-up
to Christmas with kids and…

04:38.680 --> 04:39.720
24th December.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.160
Twenty… But that's Christmas Eve!

04:42.240 --> 04:47.000
You had better prioritize, then.
Your job or Santa coming down the chimney.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.040
Right. Class dismissed.

04:54.720 --> 04:55.640
Cunningham.

04:56.440 --> 04:59.400
I can't stress to you
how important this account is for us.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.120
Jobs are on the line.

05:01.920 --> 05:02.760
Your job.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.880
Okay, I know, and I won't let you down.
I promise I'll make it work.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.000
Is that a hamster?

05:10.520 --> 05:15.200
Yes. That's my son's lunch box. Buster.
Always forgets his sandwiches.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.960
Ham sandwich, hamster sandwich.
You know what kids are like.

05:18.040 --> 05:22.280
No, I don't,
because in business, kids don't count.

05:26.120 --> 05:26.960
Okay.

05:27.680 --> 05:29.360
Okay. We can do the pitch.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.400
We can do it. We'll make it work. Okay.

05:34.880 --> 05:35.720
Come on, then.

05:37.160 --> 05:38.880
There you go. You'll be safe in there.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.320
-Hey, Matty.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.440
-What's that?
-A letter from a lawyer, I think.

05:44.520 --> 05:47.040
Boy! What you done now, bro?

05:47.120 --> 05:49.720
I've been left a… gift or an inheritance.

05:49.800 --> 05:50.680
Who from?

05:50.760 --> 05:52.960
-That's odd. It's from my dad.
-Your dad?

05:53.040 --> 05:56.080
No, it's fine.
I didn't really know him, to be honest.

05:56.160 --> 05:59.360
"Dear, Mr. Cunningham,
I've been instructed by your father

05:59.440 --> 06:01.600
to give you this letter
containing the keys to…"

06:01.680 --> 06:04.360
-"Please visit this website."
-Visit the website! Come on!

06:05.080 --> 06:05.960
"Mistletoe…"

06:13.000 --> 06:14.920
Is that yours… to keep?

06:15.760 --> 06:16.840
I don't know.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.600
Yo, that looks like it's worth a fortune,
you know?

06:20.200 --> 06:23.040
I can't deal with this right now.
We've got so much work to do.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.240
Hey. Wait a minute, man.

06:24.320 --> 06:27.080
This is exactly what you need
to nail the pitch.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.520
Peace and quiet in the countryside.

06:29.600 --> 06:32.040
Just you and the rolling hills.
No distractions.

06:32.120 --> 06:35.560
No more Cruella de Vil Fletcher
on your back.

06:35.640 --> 06:38.640
Just you and hamster,
and the lovely, friendly countryfolk.

06:38.720 --> 06:39.840
It's a win.

06:40.520 --> 06:41.520
It's a win-win.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.160
Triple win, bro.

06:43.960 --> 06:44.960
You see it, yeah?

06:46.520 --> 06:47.520
Yeah, you see it.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.280
-Are you okay, Daddy?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.000
-Have you brushed your teeth?
-Yeah.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.240
-What are you looking at?
-It's a farm, silly.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.920
-Where is the farm?
-It's in a place called Cobbledon.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.560
Can we go to the farm, Dad?

07:14.640 --> 07:16.040
Are there animals there?

07:16.120 --> 07:17.240
Yeah, like Fleece.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.320
-Please can we go to the farm?
-Yeah, please?

07:19.400 --> 07:20.960
-Please!
-For Christmas.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.400
We can't go for Christmas.

07:22.480 --> 07:25.160
How will Santa know
where to deliver all your presents?

07:25.240 --> 07:26.680
Mum would let us.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.120
The thing is,
Mummy isn't here anymore.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.320
But you said Mummy was always with us.

07:33.400 --> 07:36.720
-You said she was always in our hearts.
-Yeah, you say that every day.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.000
No, and she is. She is in our hearts.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.280
It's just Mummy can't
make the decisions anymore.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.960
That has to be Daddy's job.

07:46.280 --> 07:49.880
Well, hang on, no, 'cause…
Oh, wait a minute. She's coming in.

07:49.960 --> 07:53.320
She's coming through, and she's saying
that she still is the boss of me,

07:53.400 --> 07:54.800
and we should go to the farm.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.200
Yeah!

07:56.280 --> 07:58.560
But first I have to clear it
with the school.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.480
A village school?

08:01.560 --> 08:03.160
Mr. Cunningham, how can we be sure

08:03.240 --> 08:05.440
that they will provide
an adequate education?

08:05.520 --> 08:07.560
It can't be any worse than here!

08:07.640 --> 08:11.000
I am seeing quite dysfunctional behavior
in all five of your children.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.360
You know, Rosie is…

08:12.440 --> 08:14.840
She's really not herself.
She's very quiet.

08:14.920 --> 08:18.400
I could be forgiven for thinking
that sometimes she is asleep in my lesson.

08:18.480 --> 08:23.600
Charlie has been kicking boys and girls
and writing quite rude things.

08:23.680 --> 08:26.680
I understand that you've been
through a difficult situation,

08:26.760 --> 08:30.360
but I fear that they are falling behind
in their work.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.800
Well, don't be too hard on yourself
about that,

08:32.880 --> 08:34.880
because I know
that if you work really hard,

08:34.960 --> 08:38.320
find your mojo, next year,
these kids, they're gonna excel.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.720
So thank you. And Merry Christmas!

08:42.240 --> 08:44.560
Wetsuit? Okay. Fine.

08:45.760 --> 08:48.200
Are you
absolutely sure about this?

08:48.280 --> 08:51.400
What if you get there
and this farm doesn't exist?

08:51.480 --> 08:55.160
-I will turn around and come back.
-Just manage your expectations, won't you?

08:55.240 --> 08:59.080
Your dad was full of secrets
and surprises. Not all of them good.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.560
-Take care.
-I'll call you.

09:01.640 --> 09:02.600
Drive carefully.

09:02.680 --> 09:05.320
-Bye, Mum.
-Bye! Have a lovely time!

09:05.400 --> 09:06.480
Bye, Granny!

09:14.280 --> 09:16.000
It's so cool!

09:17.160 --> 09:18.600
Look, Dad, baa-sheep!

09:19.200 --> 09:21.040
No, it's just sheep, Buster.

09:21.120 --> 09:24.760
-Look, Dad, moo-cows!
-No, we just say "cows," son.

09:26.680 --> 09:30.360
You just missed the farm sign!
It said Mistletoe Farm back there!

09:30.440 --> 09:32.680
-What? Where?
-You missed the sign.

09:32.760 --> 09:35.680
Why didn't you tell me?
If you told me, I could've--

09:39.440 --> 09:41.920
What are you doing bringing a horse
down a narrow road?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.200
It's the countryside.

09:43.280 --> 09:46.200
Vehicles give way to animals
in the countryside.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.000
Have you read the signs?

09:48.080 --> 09:50.680
Okay, fine. Is the horse okay?

09:50.760 --> 09:53.080
Yes. No thanks to you.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.000
Oh…

09:55.560 --> 09:57.760
So much for the friendly countryfolk!

10:01.080 --> 10:03.120
I think this is it.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.080
Here we go.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.600
It says
Mistletoe Farm right there.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.240
We have arrived.

10:14.120 --> 10:16.040
Whoa! Look at that!

10:17.120 --> 10:18.440
It's so cute!

10:23.200 --> 10:25.280
Whoa!

10:25.360 --> 10:26.760
Is it our farm, Dad?

10:26.840 --> 10:29.760
-I think so.
-Look, Dad! More baa-sheep!

10:29.840 --> 10:33.200
-No, it's not baa-sheep. It's just sheep.
-Sheep poo!

10:43.560 --> 10:46.040
Well, this is a good start.

10:49.640 --> 10:50.520
Come on.

10:52.880 --> 10:53.720
Whoa!

10:56.680 --> 10:57.680
Okay.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.000
What is that smell?

10:59.080 --> 11:01.480
-I think it's you, Buster.
-It's not me!

11:02.280 --> 11:05.200
-Well, someone likes eggs.
-I think I know why, Daddy.

11:05.280 --> 11:09.080
-It's so cute. Can we keep it?
-No, we can't keep it. Come here.

11:09.160 --> 11:12.840
Listen, don't panic. That's it.
We're fine. We'll take it… Oh God! No!

11:13.360 --> 11:15.960
No, be careful! Don't… don't pick it up.

11:16.040 --> 11:19.240
Don't pick… Okay.
Well, just be… Okay. Take it outside.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.080
Okay, don't let… Be careful. Don't let it…

11:22.160 --> 11:24.240
-That's really good.
-What are these, Dad?

11:24.320 --> 11:25.920
Some, uh, biscuits.

11:26.680 --> 11:29.040
"From Barry the baker."
Who's Barry the baker?

11:29.120 --> 11:30.600
-I don't know.
-I don't know.

11:31.680 --> 11:32.680
I want this room!

11:32.760 --> 11:34.120
I want it! I love it!

11:35.120 --> 11:36.040
Let's go!

11:38.960 --> 11:41.760
-Whoa, this room is awesome!
-I want this bed.

11:41.840 --> 11:42.960
Where'd they go?

11:43.480 --> 11:47.400
Guys, we can sort bedrooms later.
First things first, let's find a kettle.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.160
You have got to be kidding me!

11:56.440 --> 11:59.720
-Oh! Hello!

11:59.800 --> 12:02.480
Hello, Mr.… Mr. Goat.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.400
Kids, careful. Come round there.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.240
Hello. What… Right.

12:06.320 --> 12:09.160
Okay, straight out there.
Off you go. That's it. Go on.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.440
Out the door!

12:11.520 --> 12:13.280
The goat has gone.

12:13.360 --> 12:17.000
Rosie, would you look after everybody,
and I will be back in a moment?

12:21.720 --> 12:22.920
Water. Water.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.200
-Oh.

12:26.280 --> 12:27.120
Hang on!

12:27.640 --> 12:29.080
Hang… Hello?

12:29.160 --> 12:33.520
-Hey! How goes it, farmer?
-<i>How goes it?</i>

12:33.600 --> 12:35.920
Not great, to be honest, Mo.
I'm sat in a stream,

12:36.000 --> 12:37.680
trying to get water for a cup of tea.

12:37.760 --> 12:39.560
Yeah. Boo-hoo and all of that, yeah.

12:39.640 --> 12:41.760
Matty, I've got some news, right?

12:41.840 --> 12:44.200
Banda House are pitching

12:44.280 --> 12:45.960
<i>for the Emblem account also.</i>

12:46.040 --> 12:49.320
Banda House? Everything they pitch for,
they end up winning!

12:49.400 --> 12:52.440
That's why we really need you
to nail this, Matty.

12:52.520 --> 12:56.200
For all of our sakes. None of us
wanna lose our jobs before Christmas.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.600
-We're really relying on you, bro.
-What's that, Mo?

12:58.680 --> 12:59.520
Yeah. Hello?

12:59.600 --> 13:01.080
Mo, I can't hear you.

13:01.920 --> 13:05.120
Yo, he's smashing it, you know?

13:05.200 --> 13:06.800
I'm not worried at all!

13:11.120 --> 13:13.840
Okay, guys, let's take these upstairs.

13:13.920 --> 13:17.040
Be careful. We don't wanna
set fire to the farmhouse tonight.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.480
Maybe tomorrow if there's insurance.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.640
Are we really gonna spend Christmas
on the farm, Dad?

13:27.240 --> 13:30.960
-I like the moo-cows.
-Yeah, I like the moo-cows too.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.960
Although we just call them…

13:34.920 --> 13:35.760
cows.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.400
You looking for Mum?

13:45.240 --> 13:47.440
Do you think she likes it here, Dad?

13:48.040 --> 13:49.960
Well, that depends.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.800
Which one do you think she is?

13:51.880 --> 13:54.400
That really twinkly one. See it?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Yes.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.320
That one's sparkling.

13:58.400 --> 14:02.920
-Wow. That one's shining.
-That one has to be Mum.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.320
-So beautiful.
-Look at that shooting star over there.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.640
-Whoa!
-Everybody make a wish.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.760
And then back to bed.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.720
Whose wellies are they, Dad?

14:28.800 --> 14:31.840
Well, I think they were my daddy's,
but I'm not sure.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.880
How come you don't know much
about your dad?

14:33.960 --> 14:35.840
Because my daddy was very busy,

14:35.920 --> 14:38.960
and I didn't see him much at all
when I was growing up,

14:39.040 --> 14:40.280
and then we lost contact.

14:40.360 --> 14:42.240
I don't want to lose contact with you.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.960
That will never ever happen, okay?

14:45.040 --> 14:47.680
-Never.

14:47.760 --> 14:49.560
Oh, God! You've broke the bed!

15:00.440 --> 15:03.200
-Kids, come in. Be careful.
-Yay! The goat's back!

15:04.000 --> 15:05.240
-Yay!
-Buster.

15:05.320 --> 15:08.200
What've we said about lollipops
for breakfast, okay? Buster.

15:08.280 --> 15:10.640
Hey! He took my lolly!

15:11.560 --> 15:13.080
Ugh, Buster!

15:13.160 --> 15:14.600
It's not me!

15:14.680 --> 15:18.600
-It is not Buster, okay? The eggs are bad.
-Maybe the chicken laid an egg.

15:18.680 --> 15:19.920
Let's go and see!

15:21.520 --> 15:25.080
-And there is no Wi-Fi. There is no Wi-Fi!
-Daddy, why are you shouting?

15:25.160 --> 15:26.520
Because there's no Wi-Fi!

15:28.440 --> 15:30.880
-Any eggs?
-We looked under every single chicken.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.280
No eggs. Nothing.

15:32.360 --> 15:36.120
-Thought there were gonna be more animals.
-Yeah, maybe even like a baby Fleece.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.880
-What was that? Come on!
-Let's go see!

15:45.680 --> 15:47.280
Tiny pony!

15:47.360 --> 15:50.200
-Real-life donkey.
-And a baby cow.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.600
And a baby Fleece.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.280
-Quick, hurry up, let's go.
-Run!

16:06.040 --> 16:07.160
It's an ogre.

16:08.320 --> 16:10.880
Who said that?
Come out and show yourselves.

16:10.960 --> 16:11.960
How did you get in?

16:12.040 --> 16:13.120
Through the door.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.880
Oh, very clever.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.720
Oh, who are you?

16:23.240 --> 16:26.640
-Well, do you have names?
-Everyone has names, don't they?

16:27.480 --> 16:29.320
Not necessarily, no. See that donkey?

16:29.400 --> 16:32.880
That's donkey number one,
and that one is donkey number two.

16:32.960 --> 16:36.560
-Why don't you name them?
-Because I forgot to do it, okay?

16:36.640 --> 16:38.040
What are your names?

16:38.120 --> 16:38.960
I'm Violet.

16:39.680 --> 16:40.840
I'm Rosie, the oldest.

16:40.920 --> 16:43.920
-I'm Buster.
-And I'm Lily, Charlie's twin.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.240
You don't look like twins.

16:45.320 --> 16:47.640
Because we're non-identical twins.

16:47.720 --> 16:51.080
Right, okay, so what
are you non-identicals doing on my farm?

16:51.160 --> 16:54.160
-Our dad won it in a Willy Wonka thing.
-What is a--

16:54.240 --> 16:56.520
He means a will.
Dad got it from his father's will.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.080
So you're the new owners?

16:58.160 --> 17:01.360
Oh my God!
Well, why didn't you say?

17:01.440 --> 17:03.240
Hello! Uh, I am Beano.

17:03.320 --> 17:07.360
Farmhand slash animal wrangler
slash professional poo-picker-upper.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.920
Hashtag Beano at your service.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.440
Pleased to meet you, guys.

17:12.520 --> 17:13.960
Oh!

17:14.040 --> 17:16.160
-Do you wanna meet the animals?
-Yes!

17:16.240 --> 17:17.520
Yes, you do!

17:17.600 --> 17:19.640
Then walk this way.

17:21.880 --> 17:25.040
So this is my man pig, Arnie,

17:25.120 --> 17:28.400
named after his favorite actor,
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.400
"I'll be back… bacon."

17:32.800 --> 17:37.720
No? Okay, and this beautiful,
beautiful soul here is Potter.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.760
Very, very magical. Trained at Hogwarts.

17:41.800 --> 17:44.680
And meet these little legends. Itsy.

17:44.760 --> 17:45.640
Aww!

17:46.240 --> 17:48.600
Bitsy. Bitsy. Yeah. Oh!

17:48.680 --> 17:51.040
Teenie. Teenie.

17:51.120 --> 17:55.200
And, oh, this one is Weenie,
but be careful about Weenie,

17:55.280 --> 17:58.640
'cause she will "wee wee wee-nie"
all the way home.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.920
Okay? Won't you, little one?
Yes, you will.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.560
-Ugh.

18:04.640 --> 18:05.760
See what I mean?

18:05.840 --> 18:06.680
Ugh.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.360
-Wanna meet Jingle?
-Yes.

18:09.960 --> 18:13.040
-Ta-da! It's Jingle!
-Aww!

18:13.120 --> 18:15.160
Why has he got bells around his neck?

18:15.240 --> 18:18.080
So if he wanders off, we can hear him.
He's only a baby sheep.

18:18.160 --> 18:20.440
-Hello, Jingle!

18:20.520 --> 18:22.520
Hello, Jingle!

18:22.600 --> 18:24.640
That's amazing!
Hello, pleased to meet you.

18:24.720 --> 18:26.440
Hello, milady. Hello, sir.

18:26.520 --> 18:29.080
Hello to you, and hello to you too.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.080
You look after Jingle, okay?

18:32.120 --> 18:34.320
Now, these two little ladies,
Mary and Bright,

18:34.400 --> 18:36.920
they speak incredible French.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.280
-Ponies don't speak French.
-<i>Excusez-moi!</i>

18:39.360 --> 18:41.920
Mary<i>. Oui. </i>Bright?

18:42.560 --> 18:44.160
<i>Oui, oui! </i>Au revoir.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.120
Au revoir.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.360
Oh, have you met Rudolph yet?

18:47.440 --> 18:48.440
As in the reindeer?

18:48.520 --> 18:52.320
-Uh, no, as in Rudolph, the Great…

18:52.400 --> 18:54.360
Oh! …Dane!

18:55.440 --> 18:57.720
Oh. See them sheep there?

18:57.800 --> 19:01.240
They belong to the farm,
and Rudolph here is gonna herd them.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.800
So, is Rudolph a sheepdog, then?

19:02.880 --> 19:06.080
Not really, no, but he's trying.
Shall we give it a go?

19:06.160 --> 19:07.240
-Yeah.
-Right.

19:07.840 --> 19:10.400
Come on, Rudolph. Herd these sheep, boy!
Come on, boy!

19:10.480 --> 19:11.920
Go on, Rudolph!

19:16.040 --> 19:17.240
Good boy.

19:19.120 --> 19:19.960
Come on.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.480
-Come-bye!

19:25.480 --> 19:27.640
Hi, kids. Where have you been?

19:27.720 --> 19:29.800
We've been talking
to the animals with Beano.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.320
That sounds great.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.520
Dad, can we go explore the farm some more?

19:33.600 --> 19:36.920
-Okay. Yeah, sure. Let me just try this.
-Beano will look after us.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.960
Okay, no worries. I'll be there in five.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.560
Wait, what? Beano? Who's… who's Beano?

19:46.160 --> 19:48.480
Right, that's… that's not gonna do it.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.680
I'm coming, kids!

19:56.120 --> 19:59.440
Okay. Right, okay. Get back!
You get back, okay? Stay back, kids!

19:59.520 --> 20:00.600
Who… who are you?

20:00.680 --> 20:01.800
Please don't shoot.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.520
He hasn't done anything wrong, Dad.
He lives here.

20:04.600 --> 20:07.720
-What do you mean?
-He lives here. He's the farmhand.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.200
And animal wangler.

20:09.280 --> 20:12.520
-No, it's actually wrangler.
-Why have you even got that, Dad?

20:12.600 --> 20:15.640
Because I didn't know that Hagrid
lived in the barn. Who are you?

20:15.720 --> 20:18.560
Listen, I'm Beano. I live here.
I've worked here my whole life.

20:18.640 --> 20:21.640
I've been telling your non-identicals
about the farm.

20:21.720 --> 20:25.320
Dad, come and meet donkey number one.
He's the cutest donkey in the world!

20:26.600 --> 20:28.240
Okay. Sorry. I just didn't…

20:28.320 --> 20:32.000
I'm sorry about… this.
I don't think it works anyway.

20:32.080 --> 20:32.920
Oh!

20:36.080 --> 20:37.560
Dad, you scared Beano!

20:37.640 --> 20:41.360
-That was an accident.
-And you scared the animals.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.520
Look at Mary! She's done
a massive scared pony poo on the floor!

20:44.600 --> 20:45.800
Say sorry to her.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.560
-Sorry, Mary.
-In French.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.360
-In?
-French.

20:52.360 --> 20:56.680
<i>Pardon, Mary.</i>
<i>Il très, </i>uh, nincompoop.

20:57.640 --> 20:58.720
So, you work here?

20:58.800 --> 21:01.840
<i>-Oui.</i>
Do you know anything about plumbing?

21:20.840 --> 21:21.680
Ta-da!

21:21.760 --> 21:25.520
-Wow, he's magic.
-Now, this is just a temporary fix, okay?

21:25.600 --> 21:27.640
I have to take a proper look
at your pipes.

21:28.600 --> 21:31.080
Okay, well, at least
I can set up my workstation.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.440
-Workstation?
-Yeah.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.600
That's why I'm here,
to work on a big pitch.

21:34.680 --> 21:37.240
-No distractions.
-What about your farm work?

21:37.320 --> 21:41.000
-Isn't that what you do?
-I am not the farmer. I am the farmhand.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.400
The previous owner, your father,
loved this place.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.240
-He was proper hands-on.
-Was he?

21:45.320 --> 21:46.800
He was a local hero.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.480
He saved this place
from the clutches of the bad people.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.440
They were gonna knock it down.

21:51.520 --> 21:55.000
These bad people,
did they offer any money or anything?

21:55.080 --> 21:57.920
What? Proper cash-a-rooney.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.480
Yeah, but he loved the animals and farm
way too much to ever sell it.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.880
-He sounds awesome.
-He was awesome.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.760
You have to admit
this place is past its sell-by date.

22:06.840 --> 22:10.400
Nothing works. Even the hens don't work.
Have you smelt the eggs? They stink!

22:10.480 --> 22:13.680
Yes, 'cause no one's been here.
We've been waiting for you,

22:13.760 --> 22:17.920
and now you are here,
you can help us save the farm.

22:18.000 --> 22:18.920
Get off me!

22:19.000 --> 22:20.680
Can we save the farm, Daddy?

22:20.760 --> 22:22.800
Yeah, Dad,
can we save the farm with Beano?

22:22.880 --> 22:25.480
No, staying here
was just a temporary thing,

22:25.560 --> 22:27.640
and I'm gonna get on with some work.

22:29.880 --> 22:33.080
We need to persuade your dad
that this farm is way more important

22:33.160 --> 22:35.480
than his silly little pitch.
Who's with me?

22:35.560 --> 22:36.600
-Yes!
-Yeah!

22:36.680 --> 22:38.760
Okay. Walk this way.

22:44.520 --> 22:47.840
Dad, you know Mummy would've wanted you
to help us save the farm.

22:47.920 --> 22:50.560
You saw how twinkly she was last night.

22:52.560 --> 22:55.640
Okay, I tell you what,
I will give you an hour tomorrow morning,

22:55.720 --> 22:57.800
and you can show me
how this whole farm works.

22:57.880 --> 22:59.320
Yes!

23:01.200 --> 23:02.440
Well done, Mr. C.

23:04.840 --> 23:05.960
Hello!

23:06.040 --> 23:09.400
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
This is your 5 a.m. wake-up call.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.120
Come on, sleepyhead.

23:12.200 --> 23:15.680
-5 a.m.? It's the middle of the night.
-Excuse me! Cows don't wait.

23:15.760 --> 23:19.240
They've got to be milked, ready or not,
and you've got to pick up their poop.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.200
Come on.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.640
Why have I got to do this job? It's awful.

23:26.720 --> 23:31.280
Cows' poop are like golden nuggets.
Fertilizes the grass, helps it grow.

23:31.360 --> 23:34.360
We love the poop. We worship the poop.

23:35.240 --> 23:38.880
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

23:38.960 --> 23:42.960
Hey, you remind me of someone.
Have you seen the film <i>The Shining</i>?

23:43.040 --> 23:45.120
Here's Beano!

23:45.840 --> 23:47.240
Let's chop some wood.

23:48.080 --> 23:51.640
You need to put your back into it,
Farmer Cunningham. Swing it really high.

23:51.720 --> 23:52.880
Yeah? Try…

23:54.800 --> 23:56.040
Whoa!

23:56.960 --> 23:59.720
-Pretend I'm a big voluptuous pig.
-Yeah.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.880
Litter. Floor. Pig. Litter.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.880
Ooh! Lollipop!

24:03.960 --> 24:06.080
Ooh!

24:10.720 --> 24:13.760
Dangerous. Put your litter in the bin.

24:13.840 --> 24:19.280
But most importantly, never ever
leave that gate to the far field open,

24:19.360 --> 24:22.320
'cause if that gate is left open,
the animals will escape.

24:22.400 --> 24:26.880
If they escape, they will get hurt,
and if they get hurt, you will get hurt.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.920
-Do you wanna meet the cows?
-Yeah!

24:29.000 --> 24:31.760
-Yes, you do! Come on. Let's go.
-Oh.

24:31.840 --> 24:35.920
We've got Matilda, Patty, Harry,
Hermione, Miss Trunchbull.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.400
A cow called Miss Trunchbull?

24:37.480 --> 24:40.360
Oh, yes. Nanny McPhee and Susan Boyle.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.960
-How many sheep do you have?

24:43.040 --> 24:46.240
Every time I count them, I fall to sleep,
so I never get to the end.

24:49.760 --> 24:52.560
-What do you get paid for doing all this?
-All this?

24:52.640 --> 24:56.080
I get to live in the barn for free
and eat all the produce that we grow,

24:56.160 --> 24:58.880
and I mean everything,
and you give me money for sweets.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.640
Obviously, you have to pay
for other things, like the vet.

25:01.720 --> 25:03.000
-The vet?
-The vet.

25:03.080 --> 25:05.440
-Someone that looks after animals.
-I know.

25:05.520 --> 25:08.040
Why do you pay for a vet?
It's a waste of money.

25:08.120 --> 25:11.040
They're like dentists.
Always add a bit extra. A rip-off.

25:11.120 --> 25:14.120
-Do you know him? Can you trust him?
-I'm a "her" actually.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.400
And I don't rip anyone off.

25:16.480 --> 25:19.520
-You're the horse lady.
-And you're the road hog.

25:19.600 --> 25:22.560
-I won't be staying long, don't worry.
-That's a shame.

25:22.640 --> 25:25.760
I baked these,
but seeing as you're not staying…

25:25.840 --> 25:27.080
Give 'em to me!

25:27.600 --> 25:29.720
Sorry, I just love Miss Ashley's cookies.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.840
-Chocolate chip?
-Triple chocolate chip.

25:31.920 --> 25:35.400
Triple chocolate chip!
Arnie! Look what Daddy's got for you.

25:38.600 --> 25:41.760
I take it you're acquainted
with all the animals here, then?

25:41.840 --> 25:44.080
I mean,
I'm not really an animal person.

25:44.160 --> 25:48.320
Well, that's a shame. Mistletoe Farm
has some wonderful livestock.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.720
-And you're about to get a new addition.
-Huh?

25:50.800 --> 25:52.880
-Holly's about to pop.
-What?

25:52.960 --> 25:54.200
She's pregnant.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.880
You're kidding!

25:56.960 --> 25:57.880
You're kidding.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.760
No, 'cause a kid is a baby goat.
It doesn't matter.

26:00.840 --> 26:04.360
You should prepare yourself
because goats often have twins,

26:04.440 --> 26:05.560
sometimes triplets.

26:05.640 --> 26:07.720
-Triplets?

26:07.800 --> 26:11.720
Oh, hello, Mr. Weenie! How are you today?

26:11.800 --> 26:15.000
Hello, Ashley.
Thank you for the cookies. I love you.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.240
-Oh, it's okay!
-Wee, wee, wee.

26:17.320 --> 26:19.880
-It's a present!
-Okay. That's… weird.

26:19.960 --> 26:22.720
Listen, it was nice to meet you
for a second time.

26:22.800 --> 26:27.200
Hopefully I don't have to see you again.
Oh, no. I just mean the animals are fine.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.400
I come and check up on them every week.

26:29.920 --> 26:34.480
And if Holly Goat's waters break,
give me a call at the surgery.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.120
I think we've got it covered.

26:37.360 --> 26:38.240
Yeah.

26:42.840 --> 26:46.280
Ooh. I think
there's something brewing, Weenie.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.280
-Dad, who was that?
-That was the vet.

26:53.360 --> 26:54.440
She's really pretty.

26:54.520 --> 26:56.720
She's really <i>expensive</i>
is what she is, Rosie,

26:56.800 --> 26:58.960
and apparently we're having kids,
maybe three.

26:59.040 --> 27:00.480
But you've just met.

27:00.560 --> 27:03.720
No, not me and Miss Ashley.
The Holly jolly goat.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.840
Mr. Cunningham,
I've give Weenie too many cookies.

27:06.920 --> 27:09.920
There's poop everywhere.
Take her. I need to clean it.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.640
But I can't… Uh…

27:11.720 --> 27:14.040
-Beano! Beano!

27:14.120 --> 27:16.320
Oh, I'm glad you're back.

27:16.400 --> 27:22.160
We've got a cat, two budgies, a parakeet,
a ferret, a rabbit, and Oscar the pig.

27:22.240 --> 27:25.040
Seems to have eaten something
that he shouldn't have again.

27:25.120 --> 27:29.640
-So, how did it go over at Mistletoe?
-I met the new owner, Mr. Cunningham.

27:29.720 --> 27:32.520
-Ooh, what's he like?
-To be honest, he's a bit…

27:35.280 --> 27:38.080
-Couldn't put it better myself.

27:39.560 --> 27:41.560
What's Oscar been up to this time?

27:41.640 --> 27:43.880
He's eaten my dad's underpants again.

27:47.080 --> 27:48.640
-Mr. Cunningham!
-Oh God!

27:48.720 --> 27:50.720
-You nearly gave me a heart attack!
-Sorry.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.560
Me and the kids have come up
with a roster of farm chores,

27:53.640 --> 27:55.720
and we put you in charge of Christmas!

27:55.800 --> 27:59.360
Yep. You've got to fix the barn up
for the Hoedown Snowdown!

27:59.440 --> 28:01.600
-The what?
-Happens every Christmas at the barn.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.000
We snow the place down.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.760
There's mulled wine
and barn dancing, cowboy.

28:05.840 --> 28:08.000
Wait, no.
It will not be happening this year.

28:08.080 --> 28:10.720
I need to do a pitch
on Christmas Eve, and I need quiet.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.520
No, this will not do.

28:12.600 --> 28:16.320
You have got to find a way
to get Christmas into this barn.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.240
Your father would be very disappointed.

28:18.320 --> 28:21.880
Listen, you can have
your Snowdown Hoedown if you like,

28:21.960 --> 28:23.840
but you're not gonna have it on my farm.

28:24.360 --> 28:26.480
Oh, boy, does your dad get angry.

28:26.560 --> 28:28.440
I don't think he likes Christmas anymore.

28:28.520 --> 28:30.840
He even made me
leave the Christmas tree at home.

28:30.920 --> 28:33.960
We need help, guys,
and I know exactly who we need.

28:34.600 --> 28:37.920
We need to get your dad into the village
to meet the village people.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.200
-Yes!
-Ooh.

28:41.200 --> 28:43.560
This, guys, is Cobbledon.

28:43.640 --> 28:47.360
Post Office.
Letters to Santa go there, okay, guys?

28:47.440 --> 28:50.160
And now I'm gonna take ya
to the Cobbledon Arms.

29:04.880 --> 29:06.840
Come on, we're clearly not welcome here.

29:06.920 --> 29:07.800
Oh.

29:15.480 --> 29:17.920
-What's all this?
-It's for you!

29:18.000 --> 29:20.960
Beano told us
you've come to save Mistletoe Farm.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.800
You're our hero!

29:22.880 --> 29:25.280
Come in, come in, let's meet everyone.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.360
This is Perky, the landlord.

29:27.440 --> 29:30.480
Pleasure to meet you, son of Cunningham.
Hey, first one's on me.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.160
This is Ted the butcher,
Barry the baker, and Merrick.

29:33.240 --> 29:35.200
Let me guess, the candlestick maker?

29:35.280 --> 29:36.840
-How'd you know?
-I was joking.

29:36.920 --> 29:38.800
He does! He makes candles.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.680
I'm Otto, the builder.

29:40.760 --> 29:43.160
Anything you need fixing, I'm your man.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.880
And I'm Barney, the postman.

29:45.960 --> 29:48.680
I delivered the inheritance.
Told you you'd like it.

29:48.760 --> 29:51.840
-And I'm the town crier!
-Hello.

29:51.920 --> 29:54.920
If you pop your head round here,
you'll see Happy, Sneezy, Dopey,

29:55.000 --> 29:56.680
and this bundle of joy, Grumpy.

29:56.760 --> 29:59.920
It's what they played in panto last year.
They were typecast.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.080
My name's Gerald Favor.
I'm the director of the Cobbledon Players.

30:03.160 --> 30:06.200
Did I ever tell you all
about that time I did <i>The Mousetrap?</i>

30:06.280 --> 30:07.520
Yes!

30:08.280 --> 30:10.240
And one of my favorites, Miss Bow.

30:10.320 --> 30:13.120
Only because I own the sweet shop.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.360
Who are these little mites?

30:15.440 --> 30:19.440
We have Master Buster, Miss Violet,
Miss Rosie, and the twins.

30:19.520 --> 30:20.880
They don't look like twins.

30:20.960 --> 30:23.080
-They're non-identical.
-Ah.

30:23.160 --> 30:24.720
-They're mine.
-Where's your mummy?

30:24.800 --> 30:25.960
She died.

30:26.040 --> 30:29.280
-Oh…
-Uh, here, have some sweets.

30:29.920 --> 30:33.840
And I knitted you some novelties.
Perhaps you'd like to choose one each.

30:33.920 --> 30:35.520
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.000
Hi, I'm Miss Nerris.

30:37.080 --> 30:40.360
Cobbledon Village School.
Are these the children joining my class?

30:40.440 --> 30:43.640
I'm excited about getting them
to hang out with children their age.

30:43.720 --> 30:45.440
There's only two children in my class.

30:45.520 --> 30:48.040
There's only two children
in the whole school, actually.

30:48.120 --> 30:51.520
You see, we're a very small village
with a teeny tiny population.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.880
Forty-seven. Twenty-nine letterboxes.

30:53.960 --> 30:56.320
Fine, as long
as they do educational activities.

30:56.400 --> 30:57.440
Of course.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.480
-If I can think of any.

30:59.560 --> 31:02.760
What I mean is
education comes in many forms.

31:02.840 --> 31:03.760
Does it?

31:03.840 --> 31:05.480
-Yeah.
-That is true.

31:05.560 --> 31:06.760
Do you like singing?

31:07.720 --> 31:10.280
-Do you?
-You're welcome to join the choir.

31:10.360 --> 31:12.800
Hi, I'm Abel.
I organize the welly throwing.

31:12.880 --> 31:16.040
I'm Aaron, head bell ringer.
We practice on a Monday if you're free.

31:16.120 --> 31:19.000
I'm Miss Verity.
I run the village bookshop and library.

31:19.080 --> 31:21.040
Pop in any time for a book and a biscuit.

31:21.120 --> 31:23.640
By the way, my name's Miss Womble,

31:23.720 --> 31:25.960
and I've created the knitting circle,

31:26.040 --> 31:29.440
and I knit all the jumpers
that you can see here,

31:29.520 --> 31:31.680
every single one of them, and the hats,

31:31.760 --> 31:34.520
and we'd be delighted
if you'd like to all join in,

31:34.600 --> 31:38.240
and we'd especially
like you to join, Mr. Cunningham.

31:38.320 --> 31:41.560
If you don't know how to knit,
we could knit you a jumper.

31:41.640 --> 31:44.440
We could knit your face onto it
if you like.

31:44.520 --> 31:45.680
What do you think?

31:45.760 --> 31:47.640
-He's handsome, isn't he?
-Yes.

31:47.720 --> 31:50.120
Listen, I'm not really into
all this community stuff.

31:50.200 --> 31:53.840
We were gonna ask you to be the president
of the Christmas Association.

31:53.920 --> 31:56.360
Your father always cut down
the biggest Christmas tree

31:56.440 --> 31:58.160
and donated it to the village square.

31:58.240 --> 32:00.280
We don't have a Christmas tree
at the house.

32:00.360 --> 32:04.560
-Not even any Christmas lights.
-No Christmas on Mistletoe Farm?

32:04.640 --> 32:07.880
Well, we'll have to see
what we can do about that, won't we?

32:07.960 --> 32:08.960
Absolutely.

32:09.040 --> 32:12.880
Uh, who fancies a Cobbledon Soda?
Yeah. You take a seat. Come on.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.760
-How's Holly Goat?

32:17.840 --> 32:20.400
Um, I haven't checked on her.
I don't know.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.960
You haven't checked on your pregnant goat?

32:23.040 --> 32:25.160
Well… No, I'm sure she'll be fine.

32:26.400 --> 32:29.280
-I'll check when I get back.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.600
5,000. 5,000? That can't…

32:44.160 --> 32:47.400
5,000, and he hasn't paid…
Have you paid for anything?

32:48.080 --> 32:50.960
Sweets. Sweets? £68 on sweets.

32:58.480 --> 32:59.360
It can't be.

33:02.040 --> 33:03.240
Is it saying "Matt"?

33:05.400 --> 33:07.880
-Hey, Holly. How you doing?

33:09.800 --> 33:11.360
Are you a bit anxious?

33:11.440 --> 33:14.040
My wife was scared
when she had our first baby.

33:14.640 --> 33:18.480
I mean, not as scared as me.
I was terrified about being a dad.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.200
Didn't know if I'd be any good.

33:21.280 --> 33:24.480
Nice to see you talking
to the animals, Mr. Cunningham.

33:24.560 --> 33:26.760
You know,
they understand everything we say,

33:26.840 --> 33:30.920
and we can understand every bleat,
moo, bark, oink, if we truly listen.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.400
Well, I have listened,
understood, and now I'm leaving.

33:34.480 --> 33:38.520
Mr. C, when you were talking to Holly
about not being a good enough dad…

33:39.240 --> 33:41.960
-I think you're going to be a great dad.
-"Going to be"?

33:42.040 --> 33:43.960
Me and your popsicle, we were close.

33:44.040 --> 33:46.760
He let me call him grandpops
because he knew he missed out

33:46.840 --> 33:48.480
on his own kid and grandkids.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.960
I don't want you missing out too.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.520
I am nothing like my "popsicle," okay?

33:53.600 --> 33:56.680
I don't think you should be sticking
your nose into my family.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.000
We're family too!

33:58.080 --> 33:59.080
How?

33:59.160 --> 34:03.200
If your popsicle was my grandpops,
then you are more or less my dad.

34:03.280 --> 34:04.800
What are you talking about?

34:04.880 --> 34:08.560
You're a fully grown man,
and you are definitely not my family.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.840
-Did you put that step there?
-No.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.160
-Night, Dad.

34:18.920 --> 34:21.520
You literally took the words
right out of my mouth.

34:29.600 --> 34:30.920
Hey, Buster, what's up?

34:31.000 --> 34:33.720
-I had a bad dream.
-Oh, buddy, come here.

34:34.760 --> 34:36.720
You know bad dreams aren't real.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.560
Do we have to go to school tomorrow?

34:39.640 --> 34:41.720
School is meant to be fun.

34:41.800 --> 34:43.920
But the children might laugh at me.

34:44.880 --> 34:48.440
-Why would anybody laugh at you?
-Because I wear sparkly things.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.040
You know, Buster,
there's absolutely nothing wrong

34:51.120 --> 34:53.960
with wearing sparkly things.
Anyone can wear sparkles.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.360
Even Fleece?

34:55.440 --> 34:56.760
Definitely Fleece.

34:57.360 --> 34:58.640
Even Mary and Bright?

34:58.720 --> 35:00.760
Yes, ponies love sparkles.

35:00.840 --> 35:01.920
Even you?

35:03.040 --> 35:05.720
Well, I'm not exactly
a sparkly kind of person,

35:05.800 --> 35:10.360
but your mum, she used to love
anything with glitter and sequins.

35:10.440 --> 35:12.360
Did she wear a princess crown?

35:14.400 --> 35:16.200
I bet she did when she was your age.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.880
-Shall we go to bed?
-Yeah.

35:19.960 --> 35:20.880
Come on, then.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.320
Mary and Bright fed and exercised?

35:42.400 --> 35:43.560
-Check!
-Check.

35:43.640 --> 35:45.480
-Cows and goats milked?
-Check.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.840
Pigs and piglets cleaned?

35:46.920 --> 35:49.280
-Double check.
-Double check-a-rooney.

35:49.360 --> 35:50.720
Next job, school.

35:51.720 --> 35:53.400
We don't wanna go to school.

35:53.480 --> 35:57.160
-We wanna stay on the farm with you.
-I don't think your dad would like that.

35:57.240 --> 36:00.840
-How are we gonna get to school anyway?
-Yeah, Dad always gives us a lift.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.720
Ta-da.

36:03.800 --> 36:05.880
-What are they?
-Bicycles.

36:06.440 --> 36:09.640
-I don't know how to ride.
-You don't know how to ride a bike?

36:09.720 --> 36:13.040
Well, then, you're gonna have to learn.
First bikes, then tractors.

36:14.120 --> 36:17.800
Get your right leg, put it over the bike.

36:17.880 --> 36:19.880
Look forward, okay? No wobbling.

36:19.960 --> 36:21.600
These are your brakes.

36:22.720 --> 36:25.680
Okay, guys? Very straight.
Focus. Let's go.

36:26.920 --> 36:28.080
Second one, go.

36:28.160 --> 36:30.720
Let's go, go, go! Yes, buddy.

36:30.800 --> 36:34.400
Feet on the pedals. Yes! You've got it!

36:35.160 --> 36:36.360
Yes!

36:44.120 --> 36:46.640
Wee!

36:51.960 --> 36:54.200
-Have you seen the kids?
-They've gone to school.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.280
-What? How?
-On their bikes. Like I did.

36:56.360 --> 36:57.280
You went to school?

36:57.360 --> 36:59.160
Yeah. I went to farm school.

36:59.240 --> 37:01.160
-Is that even a thing?
-Uh, yes.

37:01.240 --> 37:03.720
Are you sure they're gonna be okay
just biking off?

37:03.800 --> 37:05.760
-They don't know the area.
-They'll be fine.

37:05.840 --> 37:07.720
-Where's the school?
-In the village.

37:07.800 --> 37:09.400
-Where's the village?
-I don't know.

37:09.480 --> 37:12.640
-We're lost.
-It's okay, Buster.

37:12.720 --> 37:14.640
I'm getting the wobbles again!

37:14.720 --> 37:17.480
Dad says to always stay where we are
until someone finds us.

37:17.560 --> 37:18.840
There's no one here though.

37:18.920 --> 37:20.560
Yes, there is. Look!

37:20.640 --> 37:23.280
Yoo-hoo! Hello!

37:26.000 --> 37:27.280
Hello, young 'uns.

37:27.360 --> 37:28.680
We're late for school.

37:28.760 --> 37:31.360
The school's only up the road. Come on.

37:31.440 --> 37:33.840
Is there really no Christmas
on Mistletoe Farm?

37:33.920 --> 37:35.400
Nope, no Christmas.

37:35.480 --> 37:38.720
We're gonna have to help your father
bring back Christmas traditions.

37:39.480 --> 37:42.360
And this is your new school.

37:42.440 --> 37:45.560
There you are, children!
Don't worry, I've only just got here.

37:45.640 --> 37:48.040
Kayla and Kayan are dying to meet you.

37:48.120 --> 37:50.800
Pop your bikes on the floor.
Thank you so much.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.280
-In you go.
-Break a leg!

37:54.880 --> 37:58.000
Right, come on then. In you go.
Sit down at the table.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.200
Right, then.

38:03.280 --> 38:07.760
So now we have a big, huge class,
we can do so many things.

38:07.840 --> 38:11.760
We can… make a school choir
or put on a big Christmas play.

38:11.840 --> 38:12.920
-Yes!
-Yes!

38:13.000 --> 38:14.680
What else do you wanna do?

38:15.400 --> 38:19.200
-We don't really like school.
-Especially our old school.

38:19.800 --> 38:20.920
Why not?

38:21.000 --> 38:22.120
I had a lot of friends,

38:22.200 --> 38:25.640
but when Mum died,
I got sad, and they called me boring.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.760
-Oh gosh, that's terrible, isn't it?
-Yeah.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.920
-What about you, Violet?
-I get scared.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.600
Not about anything special.
I just get the wobbles sometimes.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.960
That's all right.
We all get the wobbles sometimes.

38:37.040 --> 38:39.480
Kids used to laugh at me
because I wear sparkles.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.560
We love sparkles here, don't we?

38:41.640 --> 38:43.680
-Yeah, they're pretty.
-And they're cool.

38:44.560 --> 38:47.520
How about
we decorate the school Christmas tree?

38:47.600 --> 38:49.240
-Yes!
-Make it sparkly.

38:49.320 --> 38:50.720
Come on, then. Follow me.

38:53.320 --> 38:55.440
That's it. Pop your decorations on.

38:57.400 --> 39:00.520
-Where'd you get that star, Violet?
-I made it for my mum at nursery.

39:00.600 --> 39:04.200
We put it on the tree every year,
but there's not a tree at the farmhouse.

39:04.280 --> 39:08.200
Well, Miss Nerris, maybe we can lend them
our tree this year. We don't mind.

39:08.280 --> 39:10.120
I don't think your dad would like it.

39:10.200 --> 39:13.320
I think our dad would be so busy working,
he wouldn't even notice.

39:13.400 --> 39:15.520
Really? Well, that's perfect.

39:15.600 --> 39:19.040
We'll take the tree to the farmhouse,
and he won't even know we've been.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.920
Global? Global, global. Global.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.400
-Marketing. Advantages.

39:31.560 --> 39:32.840
Merry Crimble!

39:32.920 --> 39:35.160
Festive gifts and Womble's knits!

39:35.240 --> 39:37.800
-It's Christmas!
-Ho-ho-ho!

39:37.880 --> 39:40.280
-Sorry, what?
-Where would you like us to start?

39:40.360 --> 39:43.160
-Start?
-We've got to start on the decorations.

39:43.240 --> 39:45.120
-Okay.
-No, we'll dress the set.

39:45.200 --> 39:47.360
-Come on, Dame Judi.
-See you later.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.120
Oh, Merry Christmas, Mr. Cunningham!

39:57.200 --> 40:00.200
Okay, listen, everyone.
Sorry, can I get your attention?

40:00.280 --> 40:03.120
I really do appreciate
the community spirit. I do, okay?

40:03.200 --> 40:05.760
But is there not a time
that is more convenient?

40:05.840 --> 40:08.000
Christmas won't wait for convenience.

40:08.080 --> 40:10.440
The Hoedown Snowdown
will not stage itself.

40:10.520 --> 40:14.520
We are not having the Hoedown Snowdown
this year. Not here, not now.

40:14.600 --> 40:16.400
Okay? So if everyone can just…

40:16.480 --> 40:18.960
Thank you so much.
It's great, but if you can…

40:19.040 --> 40:21.920
That's it, take your hammer.
Off you go. Very good. Thank you.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.160
All the best. Thank you.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.520
They're only trying
to bring Christmas spirit.

40:26.600 --> 40:30.520
I don't need Christmas spirit.
I need peace and quiet.

40:31.120 --> 40:31.960
Well…

40:32.720 --> 40:37.240
No. No. Out! Fine, no. Tell you what.
Stay. Make yourself a sandwich.

40:37.320 --> 40:38.640
Make yourself at home.

40:38.720 --> 40:41.120
-Get out of my way.

40:41.200 --> 40:44.440
Don't worry, donkey number two.
He's just a silly old Grinch.

40:44.520 --> 40:46.000
I know.

40:46.080 --> 40:48.320
-Who wears a tie at a farm?

40:49.440 --> 40:52.720
Ho-ho-ho. I've got a delivery for you.

40:52.800 --> 40:55.520
-What delivery?
-Christmas cards from the villagers.

40:55.600 --> 40:57.200
A lovely one from Miss Womble.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.800
Hand-knitted, impressive.
Two lines of poetry in it.

40:59.880 --> 41:03.120
-Sorry, are you reading my post?
-Only for health and safety.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.400
Shall I take yours
to the sorting office now?

41:09.000 --> 41:11.600
It's Womble, L-E. Not E-L.

41:12.840 --> 41:16.600
You might wanna put a kiss on each card.
We usually do, just to be friendly.

41:16.680 --> 41:17.920
I'm not putting a kiss.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.240
And talking of Christmas cards,
your father used to be so popular,

41:21.320 --> 41:24.440
he had hundreds of cards up here
round on the walls.

41:24.520 --> 41:25.520
And generous!

41:25.600 --> 41:27.960
He used to put a £10 note in each card

41:28.040 --> 41:30.880
with a little note saying,
"Have a Cobbledon Brew on me."

41:30.960 --> 41:33.240
Did he? Good for him.
Right. That's the last one.

41:33.320 --> 41:34.440
And you need to go.

41:34.520 --> 41:38.840
I have a very important virtual meeting
with a friend of mine starting very soon.

41:38.920 --> 41:39.960
All right.

41:40.880 --> 41:45.320
We have real friends round here,
Mr. Cunningham, not virtual ones.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.520
Virtual friends, I don't know!

41:49.680 --> 41:53.880
Ah, Miss Nerris, seeing as I'm passing,
I'll just give you one of those.

41:53.960 --> 41:55.520
-Lovely. Thank you.
-From…

41:55.600 --> 41:56.760
What's this?

41:56.840 --> 41:58.200
We brought it from the school!

41:58.280 --> 42:02.440
-Miss Nerris said we could!
-Can we show Kayla and Kayan the animals?

42:02.520 --> 42:05.720
-Haven't they got to get back to school?
-No. Children love animals.

42:05.800 --> 42:08.920
Like I said, Mr. Cunningham,
education takes many forms.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.960
Mr. C! Mr. C!

42:11.040 --> 42:14.080
Farmer Cunningham, it's Holly Goat.
Her waters have broken!

42:14.160 --> 42:15.440
-What?
-Quick!

42:15.520 --> 42:17.880
Okay, listen,
I need you to call Miss Ashley, okay?

42:17.960 --> 42:20.440
And… Oh, get a discount.

42:21.320 --> 42:22.560
I'm coming!

42:22.640 --> 42:23.680
Hang on!

42:36.160 --> 42:39.520
Miss Ashley's on her way. Do you mind
if me and the kids stay and watch?

42:39.600 --> 42:43.640
-This would be very educational.
-Please can we see the baby goat get born?

42:43.720 --> 42:47.640
Stay up there, okay? Stay out the way
because this is grown-up stuff.

42:47.720 --> 42:49.680
Blow out, blow in, blow out, blow in.

42:49.760 --> 42:52.520
You don't blow out, blow in.
You breathe in, you breathe out.

42:52.600 --> 42:55.800
Breathe in, breathe out.
Breathe in, breathe out.

42:55.880 --> 42:58.440
I can't breathe.
I'm having a panic attack.

42:58.520 --> 43:01.080
You're hyperventilating.
You need to calm down.

43:04.320 --> 43:07.680
No! Please! Come on, sheepy-sheep.

43:08.280 --> 43:11.200
-That's it. I do have somewhere to go.

43:11.280 --> 43:13.520
-Yes!
-That's… Oh, God! There's a head!

43:13.600 --> 43:16.080
There's a head in a bubble.
I can't… I'm gonna…

43:16.160 --> 43:18.320
No, no. You are not gonna pass out!

43:18.400 --> 43:20.520
This is just Mother Nature
taking its course.

43:20.600 --> 43:24.120
Look, I'll just take a… Oh my God.
Yeah, that is a bit weird. I'm dizzy!

43:24.200 --> 43:25.480
Let me help.

43:26.640 --> 43:31.480
Sh, it's all right. It's all right.
You're doing really well. Keep pushing.

43:31.560 --> 43:36.280
Harder! Keep pushing! Harder!
You're doing great! Harder! Keep pushing.

43:42.520 --> 43:46.080
-Violet, you totally smashed it!
-Look at what you did!

43:46.760 --> 43:47.960
Look what you did.

43:49.440 --> 43:52.160
I got here as fast as I could.
How's everything going?

43:52.240 --> 43:55.120
-Well, you missed the whole thing.
-I wouldn't be so sure.

43:55.200 --> 43:58.920
-She's right. I can see another bubble.
-Beano, listen. I don't feel…

43:59.000 --> 44:02.040
What are you doing?
This is no time to sleep.

44:02.120 --> 44:04.520
Violet will help you.
She delivered the first one.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.840
-Well done, Violet.
-Come on, Holly.

44:08.080 --> 44:11.880
Ah! I'll just,
uh, wrap her up in a towel.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.440
So cute.

44:14.520 --> 44:17.840
-Ooh. Oh! Looks like she's pushing again.

44:17.920 --> 44:20.280
No, now is not a good time. I can't talk.

44:20.360 --> 44:22.000
Fletcher wants an update now!

44:22.080 --> 44:24.720
I tried covering for you,
but she wants to speak to you.

44:24.800 --> 44:27.760
-Tell her I'm indisposed.
-I tried, but she's insisting!

44:27.840 --> 44:31.000
Looks like a breech.
I can find the feet. I need you to pull.

44:31.080 --> 44:33.920
-What are you doing, anyway?
-I'm trying to deliver a kid.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.440
-What?
-Oh God, Miss Fletcher's calling me.

44:36.520 --> 44:38.160
Cunningham! Is that you?

44:38.240 --> 44:39.840
Hi! Miss Fletcher.

44:39.920 --> 44:41.720
It has come to my understanding

44:41.800 --> 44:44.400
that you're in some kind
of creative retreat

44:44.480 --> 44:47.680
so as to have no distractions, as it were.
Is that right?

44:47.760 --> 44:48.920
That's right!

44:49.000 --> 44:51.320
-That's it! Push! I need you to pull.

44:51.400 --> 44:54.360
-Is that a woman's voice I can hear?
-No, it's just a kid.

44:54.440 --> 44:55.480
Come on, Holly. Push.

44:55.560 --> 44:59.440
Children and business do not mix!

44:59.520 --> 45:02.360
Sorry, Miss Fletcher, you're breaking up.
I have to go.

45:03.200 --> 45:05.840
Come on, Holly! Push! I need you to push.

45:05.920 --> 45:07.000
Pull.

45:07.080 --> 45:09.000
-That's it.

45:13.120 --> 45:14.840
-We did it!
-We did it!

45:15.680 --> 45:17.760
Sorry. I didn't… It's just…

45:17.840 --> 45:19.360
-Yeah.
-We made a baby!

45:19.440 --> 45:20.800
We made a baby!

45:20.880 --> 45:22.080
Ooh, big daddy!

45:28.680 --> 45:31.120
Look how many babies
you've gone and done.

45:31.200 --> 45:34.560
Who's a good daddy?
You're a good daddy. Who's a good daddy?

45:35.080 --> 45:37.280
-No, she's not taking.

45:37.960 --> 45:40.520
I'm afraid you're going
to have to hand-rear them.

45:40.600 --> 45:42.000
Take them in for a while.

45:42.600 --> 45:44.120
Miss Holly's exhausted.

45:44.200 --> 45:46.200
Don't worry, they'll be okay.

45:46.280 --> 45:49.520
If you can bottle-feed them,
take them to bed, cuddle them,

45:49.600 --> 45:53.520
keep them warm, sing to them,
things you did with your own children.

45:53.600 --> 45:55.840
I didn't really do the nursing stuff.

45:55.920 --> 45:57.960
Well, now's your chance.

45:58.560 --> 45:59.840
-Okay.

46:00.800 --> 46:03.400
So you did really well, Miss Violet.

46:03.480 --> 46:05.760
Would you like to come and help me
at the surgery?

46:05.840 --> 46:09.400
-Yes, please. Can I, Dad?
-I don't see why not.

46:09.480 --> 46:13.160
I know he wants them to be in school,
but seeing little Violet there in action

46:13.240 --> 46:16.240
makes me think farm school
would be better for their confidence.

46:16.320 --> 46:19.920
Oh, thank you, Miss Nerris. That's what
I've been trying to tell people.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.320
Farm school is amazing,

46:21.400 --> 46:24.120
and Farmer Cunningham
needs it more than anyone.

46:24.200 --> 46:27.080
And the kids, too,
especially Kayla and Kayan.

46:27.160 --> 46:29.000
They've been on their own up until now.

46:29.920 --> 46:33.280
Don't worry, Miss Nerris.
Beano's got a plan.

46:37.320 --> 46:39.520
We've got three baby Christmas goats.

46:39.600 --> 46:41.680
So what about… Snowy?

46:41.760 --> 46:43.480
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Star.

46:43.560 --> 46:45.360
-Yeah!
-Do you want to name the third?

46:45.440 --> 46:47.000
-Yes.
-Go on, then!

46:54.080 --> 46:56.080
We want to name it after our mummy.

46:57.720 --> 46:59.360
This little dude's a boy.

46:59.440 --> 47:02.160
We don't mind. We want to call it Sarah.

47:03.040 --> 47:04.120
Welcome, Sarah,

47:05.280 --> 47:06.400
to the family.

47:15.800 --> 47:17.960
-Hello?
-<i>Yo, she's after your address.</i>

47:18.040 --> 47:20.200
-She wants to know where the farm is!
-What?

47:20.280 --> 47:23.440
<i>Fletcher! She said she was</i>
<i>disappointed with your FaceTime call,</i>

47:23.520 --> 47:25.280
said you were distracted by your kids!

47:25.360 --> 47:27.920
Well, to be honest,
it wasn't my kids. It was Holly's.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.160
<i>You were supposed to go to that farm</i>
<i>to work, to save our jobs.</i>

47:31.240 --> 47:34.000
The Banda House vultures
are circling this deal, bro!

47:34.080 --> 47:36.040
-Somebody at the door.

47:39.760 --> 47:41.040
Hi, Mr. Cunningham.

47:41.120 --> 47:43.080
Just thought that it'd be really nice

47:43.160 --> 47:45.520
if the children could spend time
with the baby goats?

47:45.600 --> 47:47.600
-Uh, what, today?

47:47.680 --> 47:50.480
Me and the villagers
thought it'd be really great

47:50.560 --> 47:52.960
if everyone could take part
in their education,

47:53.040 --> 47:54.280
and today is your turn.

47:54.360 --> 47:56.280
I've already got five children,
three kids.

47:56.360 --> 47:57.760
You want to give me two more?

47:57.840 --> 48:01.040
"It'd be so good for them to have
children their own age to play with."

48:01.120 --> 48:03.600
-Isn't that what you said?
-Yes. But I didn't mean--

48:03.680 --> 48:05.720
Okay, off you pop. Have fun!

48:05.800 --> 48:09.680
-Enjoy farm school!
-Right, who wants to dig up some sprouts?

48:09.760 --> 48:10.960
Yes, come on. Follow me!

48:11.040 --> 48:13.440
Last one to the top of the hill
has to peel them too!

48:13.520 --> 48:14.880
You too, Mr. Cunningham!

48:16.440 --> 48:17.640
Come on, Rudolph!

48:18.640 --> 48:19.640
Come on, boy.

48:22.360 --> 48:25.280
-What's going on?
-We're having sprouts for lunch.

48:25.360 --> 48:28.040
Good luck
getting my kids to have sprou--

48:28.120 --> 48:28.960
Mm.

48:29.480 --> 48:31.200
Buster, where's your lollipop?

48:31.280 --> 48:33.960
I gave it to Billy Goat.
I like sprouts now.

48:34.040 --> 48:36.560
-Do you want a sprout?
-No. Absolutely not.

48:36.640 --> 48:38.840
You can't hide in your study forever!

48:39.480 --> 48:43.240
So we need to find a way to draw him out
of that boring little study.

48:43.320 --> 48:45.840
-Any ideas?
-Why don't you show Dad your tractor?

48:45.920 --> 48:48.240
Oh yeah! Even Daddy likes tractors.

48:48.320 --> 48:49.880
Yes. Yes, I love it.

48:49.960 --> 48:52.640
It's big. It's bold. It's beautiful!

48:52.720 --> 48:54.000
Come on, follow me.

48:54.080 --> 48:55.480
Let's go!

48:55.560 --> 48:58.920
-Ready? Let's go! Woo-hoo!

49:00.680 --> 49:03.640
Innovation that we can bring
to your products and your businesses.

49:06.400 --> 49:08.040
-We go the extra mile.

49:08.120 --> 49:10.080
-Why is it doing that? The--

49:10.160 --> 49:11.000
What's that?

49:13.920 --> 49:17.240
It's crashed. Oh my God.
Yeah, I know. It's worse than that. Okay.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.120
What else did I write?
I wrote "connections."

49:25.080 --> 49:27.080
Oh, this is a nightmare!

49:33.240 --> 49:35.040
What's that growing on the tree, Beano?

49:35.120 --> 49:36.040
Oh, this?

49:36.120 --> 49:38.800
This is mistletoe.
It grows all over the farm.

49:38.880 --> 49:44.080
That's where Mistletoe Farm gets its name.
But our mistletoe is magic.

49:44.160 --> 49:45.040
What do you mean?

49:45.120 --> 49:47.680
Our mistletoe
doesn't make people just kiss.

49:48.240 --> 49:50.760
It makes them fall in love.

49:50.840 --> 49:52.120
Ooh!

49:52.200 --> 49:53.640
Come on! I'll show ya.

49:55.320 --> 49:59.200
Donkey number one, donkey number two,
I've seen the way you look at each other.

49:59.280 --> 50:02.560
Now it's time to bring some magic
to your romance.

50:05.720 --> 50:07.120
Aww!

50:07.200 --> 50:08.200
Yes!

50:08.280 --> 50:10.240
Love is in the air!

50:11.440 --> 50:14.320
That's what I'm saying.
It's an absolute nightmare.

50:14.400 --> 50:17.240
My computer's crashed.
He's left me all these unpaid bills.

50:17.320 --> 50:20.520
-Hay bills, electricity, gas, water!
-I knew this would happen.

50:20.600 --> 50:22.200
Your father's left you in trouble.

50:22.280 --> 50:24.720
I know that you said
to manage my expectations.

50:24.800 --> 50:26.760
We're coming back to London straight away.

50:27.400 --> 50:29.200
Sorry, Mum, can I call you back?

50:29.720 --> 50:33.560
-Do you want to ride the tractor?
-No! I've got tons of work to do!

50:34.280 --> 50:37.360
-I don't wanna go back to London.
-We have to do something.

50:37.440 --> 50:40.640
Magic mistletoe. Voilà.

50:44.760 --> 50:46.240
Merry Christmas to you.

50:46.320 --> 50:48.040
-Merry Christmas.
-How's it going?

50:48.120 --> 50:52.080
We're trying to help with the bills
so he doesn't take them back to London.

50:52.160 --> 50:55.120
No way! You can't go back there!
This is your home now.

50:55.200 --> 50:58.320
-What's going on?
-Their dad wants to take 'em to London.

50:58.400 --> 51:01.360
But you're the future of Cobbledon.
All right, let me get one.

51:01.960 --> 51:06.000
Hello, children. I've brought you each
a ball of wool and some needles.

51:06.080 --> 51:10.480
You can choose your color.
Ooh! The mistletoe.

51:10.560 --> 51:14.040
I haven't seen this for a while.
I'm gonna have a whole basketful.

51:14.120 --> 51:16.040
-Oh!
-Thank you.

51:16.120 --> 51:18.680
-Never know when the magic will happen!
-No!

51:20.920 --> 51:22.200
Hello, Otto.

51:23.240 --> 51:25.280
Hey, you want some? It's for a good cause.

51:25.360 --> 51:28.240
Why would I want some?
It's not like I want to kiss Miss Nerris.

51:31.560 --> 51:32.840
I've made a contribution.

51:32.920 --> 51:36.360
I'll keep it safe… until you're ready.

51:36.440 --> 51:39.240
I've been ready for years, Otto.

51:39.880 --> 51:42.680
-Ooh!

51:42.760 --> 51:44.560
Beano, can I get some of that?

51:44.640 --> 51:46.440
Thank you very much.

51:46.520 --> 51:48.680
Hello, ladies!

52:00.720 --> 52:02.160
Hello!

52:06.080 --> 52:08.040
How are the kids?

52:08.120 --> 52:10.240
Mr. Cunningham's
doing really well with them.

52:10.320 --> 52:12.080
He's even named one of them Sarah.

52:12.160 --> 52:14.960
I'll take one of those.
You never know when you might need it.

52:15.040 --> 52:17.880
-Yeah.

52:17.960 --> 52:19.000
Bye.

52:23.040 --> 52:25.920
It's gonna happen! It's gonna happen!

52:31.520 --> 52:33.440
Sorry to disturb you.

52:34.400 --> 52:36.760
I hear you're thinking
about going back to the city.

52:36.840 --> 52:39.360
-Where'd you hear that?
-The village vine.

52:39.440 --> 52:41.560
-Can you take Snowy?
-Sure.

52:42.200 --> 52:44.600
-Come on.
-I just need to go boil the kettle.

52:44.680 --> 52:47.120
Get the hot water bottles ready. Come on.

52:48.640 --> 52:50.080
Hey, guys.

52:50.960 --> 52:52.640
I'm gonna keep you nice and warm.

52:55.200 --> 52:56.880
-Good girl.

52:56.960 --> 52:58.520
How are you girls getting on?

52:59.120 --> 53:02.560
-New owner treating you well? Huh?

53:02.640 --> 53:07.080
-You're great with the animals.
-Thank you. Just did Holly's milk.

53:07.160 --> 53:08.040
Thank you.

53:08.840 --> 53:10.920
It's easier with Holly's kids than my own.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.920
Must be hard for them losing their mum.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.800
I don't really like to talk about it.

53:14.880 --> 53:17.960
Well, if you ever do want
to talk about it,

53:18.040 --> 53:19.640
I'm good with humans too.

53:19.720 --> 53:21.840
-Oh, yeah.

53:24.080 --> 53:27.160
Emergency. It's, uh, Oscar the pig again.

53:27.240 --> 53:28.760
-Gotta go!
-No, wait.

53:28.840 --> 53:30.080
You dropped something.

53:32.920 --> 53:34.560
Do you think she used the mistletoe?

53:34.640 --> 53:37.840
Doesn't look like it. But if your dad
and Miss Ashley did fall in love,

53:37.920 --> 53:40.400
he would definitely want to stay
and save the farm.

53:40.480 --> 53:43.520
-We need to make it happen.
-What about Mum?

53:45.080 --> 53:46.880
I think she wants that too.

53:47.920 --> 53:50.320
We need to find a way
to get Miss Ashley back here.

53:50.400 --> 53:52.320
Why don't we ask her for dinner tomorrow?

53:52.400 --> 53:54.520
And pretend that Rudolph's sick
and needs help?

53:54.600 --> 53:56.800
Won't she be mad
if she finds out we're lying?

53:56.880 --> 53:58.480
No, no. She won't find out.

53:58.560 --> 54:01.720
Rudolph is a really good actor.
He is well sick.

54:02.520 --> 54:06.200
Right, for this smoochy magic to work,
we're gonna need way more mistletoe, okay?

54:06.280 --> 54:07.960
Let's spread out all over the farm.

54:08.040 --> 54:10.680
Operation Mistletoe, go, go, go! Let's go!

54:15.480 --> 54:17.200
I have had no updates

54:17.280 --> 54:21.960
and no evidence
to suggest he has done any work at all.

54:22.040 --> 54:24.920
If Fletcher Consultants is in trouble,

54:25.480 --> 54:28.760
I need to see it with my own eyes.

54:30.120 --> 54:31.440
No, she can't come here.

54:31.520 --> 54:33.440
<i>That's what she said! She's the boss!</i>

54:33.520 --> 54:35.280
I think she thinks you're hiding.

54:35.360 --> 54:38.480
Just stop her from coming, okay?
I am so close to nailing this pitch.

54:39.760 --> 54:43.200
You look worried. Why am I talking
to a goat? I need to get out!

54:43.280 --> 54:46.120
Brilliant job! Yes! Let's go, go, go!

54:54.160 --> 54:56.880
-Peekaboo!
-Hello there.

54:56.960 --> 55:00.480
I understand you're having
a bit of financial difficulty at the farm.

55:00.560 --> 55:02.920
Now look,
we've got a Christmas show coming up.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.640
I would be more than happy
to do a bucket collection.

55:05.720 --> 55:08.080
I really need a singer
for the carol concert.

55:08.160 --> 55:10.240
Maybe a little singsong
will cheer you up.

55:10.320 --> 55:11.400
No, I don't sing.

55:11.480 --> 55:14.360
Lily's coming to the library later.
You could read with her.

55:14.440 --> 55:18.200
Pop into the bakery. Violet's coming in
to help with the Christmas cakes.

55:18.280 --> 55:20.520
No, I'm trying to lose calories,
not gain them.

55:20.600 --> 55:22.600
We don't count calories in Cobbledon!

55:22.680 --> 55:24.400
Tie it up all over the house,

55:24.480 --> 55:27.400
so when they walk under it,
they have to kiss,

55:27.480 --> 55:29.560
and then, boom, magic!

55:29.640 --> 55:33.120
I've been meaning to ask about
the Christmas tree. You won't let us down!

55:33.200 --> 55:38.040
Mr. Cunningham, we've got
a quote here for a new roof on the barn.

55:38.120 --> 55:40.120
It's in a terrible state,
leaking for years.

55:40.200 --> 55:42.800
It's a bit expensive,
but maybe we can all help out.

55:42.880 --> 55:43.800
I'm not a charity.

55:43.880 --> 55:48.400
-But you're family. Cobbledon family.
-You're one of the village people now.

55:48.480 --> 55:50.640
Always great to see you,
and I'll see you soon.

55:50.720 --> 55:52.600
-At the Christmas fair!
-Christmas fair.

55:52.680 --> 55:55.640
-That's where we'll see you.
-See you.

55:55.720 --> 55:57.560
-At the Christmas fair!
-Okay!

55:57.640 --> 56:00.280
-Don't miss it!
-Missing you already!

56:09.120 --> 56:11.200
-Where's my speech?
-What speech?

56:11.280 --> 56:13.280
The thing I've been writing on paper!

56:13.360 --> 56:17.000
-You mean that one?
-No, no, no! Give me that.

56:18.880 --> 56:21.240
Have you not got a backup
on your computer?

56:21.320 --> 56:23.920
Computer's broken.
That's why I wrote it on paper.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.040
Okay. Now I've had another little fiddle
with the pipes,

56:27.120 --> 56:29.480
but I think you're gonna need
a proper plumber.

56:29.560 --> 56:31.000
Oh! Oh, Mr. Cunningham!

56:31.080 --> 56:32.320
Oh no!

56:33.560 --> 56:34.440
It's freezing!

56:37.320 --> 56:39.160
-It's freezing!

56:39.240 --> 56:41.440
Mistletoe Farm.
I've got a bit of an emergency.

56:41.520 --> 56:45.640
Broken water pipe.
Yeah, quick as you can. Okay, thank you.

56:47.800 --> 56:51.200
"Rural Estates.
Property Buyers. Cash Offers."

56:58.920 --> 56:59.760
Hello.

56:59.840 --> 57:02.400
Sorry, I haven't got time.
I'm waiting for a plumber.

57:02.480 --> 57:04.600
-I am the plumber.
-You're the baker!

57:04.680 --> 57:07.080
-And plumber.
-Come in. Thank you.

57:11.320 --> 57:13.680
We're so grateful
you came to rescue the farm,

57:13.760 --> 57:17.160
save it from those nasty developers
who were sniffing around.

57:17.240 --> 57:18.880
Oh, rotten, they were.

57:18.960 --> 57:22.600
Relentless, yeah.
They only care about money, money, money.

57:22.680 --> 57:23.800
They sound terrible.

57:23.880 --> 57:27.000
They don't care if those animals
are carted off to you know where.

57:27.080 --> 57:30.360
It'll be Jingle pie,
and goat curry for those poor babies.

57:30.440 --> 57:31.520
That'll fix it.

57:31.600 --> 57:33.040
You're a lifesaver. Thank you.

57:33.120 --> 57:35.320
-All the best, Mr. Cunningham. Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

57:35.400 --> 57:37.000
-Thanks again!
-Bye!

57:38.400 --> 57:40.200
It's okay, Rudolph.

57:40.880 --> 57:43.840
-What's going on?
-Rudolph's in pain.

57:43.920 --> 57:46.360
Has he eaten something bad?
Has he got a bad stomach?

57:46.440 --> 57:48.920
His farts have been
really stinky lately, haven't they?

57:49.000 --> 57:49.840
Really stinky.

57:49.920 --> 57:52.760
I can prescribe him some painkillers
if he's off his food.

57:52.840 --> 57:55.720
-Can Miss Ashley stay for dinner tonight?
-Well, not tonight.

57:55.800 --> 57:58.280
It's just I've got
all those leftovers from yesterday,

57:58.360 --> 57:59.560
and I need to do my work.

57:59.640 --> 58:03.320
Well, maybe you should look up
from your work sometimes, Mr. Cunningham.

58:03.400 --> 58:06.000
-Do that. Look up. Go on.
-Yeah, look up, Daddy.

58:06.080 --> 58:08.920
-Look up!
-Up, up, up!

58:09.480 --> 58:10.360
Oh.

58:10.960 --> 58:12.520
Huh. Who put that there?

58:12.600 --> 58:16.440
I think I'm just gonna go
and check up on the goats. Yeah?

58:16.520 --> 58:17.360
Uh…

58:18.280 --> 58:20.680
I-I think I'm just gonna go
and check on Miss Ashley.

58:22.600 --> 58:26.160
Oh, yes, well done, Rudolph.

58:26.240 --> 58:27.800
Bravo, my friend, bravo.

58:27.880 --> 58:30.360
You're a star. You're a star, my friend!

58:31.520 --> 58:32.960
-Hi.

58:33.040 --> 58:35.440
Don't worry about Rudolph. He's okay.

58:35.520 --> 58:38.360
-Oh, good.
-Prescription for Billy the goat.

58:40.040 --> 58:41.040
Bad tooth.

58:41.120 --> 58:43.440
Someone's been feeding him sweets.

58:43.520 --> 58:45.440
Oh, it's Buster. Lollipops.

58:45.520 --> 58:47.640
Although apparently
Buster likes sprouts now.

58:47.720 --> 58:48.720
Much healthier.

58:48.800 --> 58:52.920
It's obvious they like each other.
Why didn't they kiss under the mistletoe?

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
And I think we need to reunite Holly
with the kids again. She's much stronger.

58:57.080 --> 58:59.640
Oh. I was enjoying
looking after the little ones.

58:59.720 --> 59:03.520
The man who's not really an animal person
suddenly finds his heart.

59:03.600 --> 59:05.000
I wouldn't go that far.

59:05.680 --> 59:08.920
It's just since my heart broke,
I've tried not to use it, you know?

59:11.080 --> 59:14.600
-Have a good evening.
-Yeah. Yeah, you too.

59:16.960 --> 59:20.720
Don't you think the stars shine brighter
in the countryside?

59:20.800 --> 59:23.880
Well, there's more sky,
so there's more stars.

59:24.560 --> 59:27.160
Makes you feel like
you're being watched over, doesn't it?

59:27.760 --> 59:28.760
What do I do?

59:30.040 --> 59:31.000
Should I stay?

59:32.040 --> 59:33.200
Give me a sign.

59:44.080 --> 59:45.480
Hi, Dad.

59:45.560 --> 59:47.960
Charlie, are you knitting?
You're meant to be asleep.

59:48.040 --> 59:49.400
I need to get it done, Dad.

59:49.480 --> 59:52.000
-What is it? A present? Is it for me?
-It's for Kayla.

59:52.080 --> 59:54.360
-What are these?
-They're for the triplets.

59:54.440 --> 59:57.760
Miss Womble knitted them.
She's gonna knit one for Jingle.

59:57.840 --> 1:00:00.360
Well, they are very lucky little goats.

1:00:00.440 --> 1:00:03.840
They're going back into the barn tonight,
so these are gonna keep them warm.

1:00:10.240 --> 1:00:12.640
There we go. There we go.

1:00:12.720 --> 1:00:13.840
Star, come on.

1:00:15.600 --> 1:00:17.720
-Let's see if you can latch on.
-Go on, Star.

1:00:18.600 --> 1:00:20.240
-Come on. That's it.

1:00:20.320 --> 1:00:21.320
That's it!

1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:25.200
-Yes, she did it.
-That's fantastic. Okay. Here we go.

1:00:25.280 --> 1:00:28.560
Snowy's turn. Go on, Snowy.
Go on. Don't be nervous.

1:00:28.640 --> 1:00:30.680
-Come on, Snowy.
-That's it. Go on.

1:00:30.760 --> 1:00:33.680
-That's it. You're doing it, Snowy.
-Yeah, he did it!

1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:34.800
Yeah!

1:00:34.880 --> 1:00:36.360
Okay, Sarah, come on.

1:00:37.600 --> 1:00:38.600
Off you go. Go on.

1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:41.440
-Go on, Sarah.
-Do it for Mum, Sarah.

1:00:42.480 --> 1:00:44.680
-Go on.
-Come on, Sarah. You can do it.

1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:46.080
Come on.

1:00:46.160 --> 1:00:47.760
That's right, Sarah.

1:00:47.840 --> 1:00:50.440
-That's it. You've nearly got it.
-You're nearly there.

1:00:50.520 --> 1:00:51.400
Sarah!

1:00:51.480 --> 1:00:52.600
You've done it!

1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:55.160
-Sarah, you've done it!

1:00:55.240 --> 1:00:57.000
You good girl. You're such a good mum.

1:00:57.080 --> 1:01:00.760
How about you go back to bed? I'll stay
with Holly and the kids all night.

1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:02.040
Well done, Sarah.

1:01:03.480 --> 1:01:04.680
I love you.

1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:06.080
Love you.

1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:13.080
You did really well with them goats.

1:01:13.160 --> 1:01:14.200
Oh.

1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:18.000
-Do you wanna sleep in my hammock?
-You just want to sleep in my bed.

1:01:18.080 --> 1:01:19.600
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:23.320
I'm gonna snuggle down here,
nice and cozy like a piglet.

1:01:23.400 --> 1:01:24.400
What was he like?

1:01:25.520 --> 1:01:28.440
My dad. I'm wearing his clothes.
I don't know anything about him.

1:01:28.520 --> 1:01:30.120
He was a bit like Arnie the pig.

1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:31.880
Like, big and cuddly.

1:01:31.960 --> 1:01:35.000
He loved nature, loved animals.
He loved the stars too.

1:01:35.080 --> 1:01:39.800
He used to say no matter how dark it got,
there was always stars to light the way.

1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:43.280
If he was so wonderful,
how come he just left me?

1:01:43.360 --> 1:01:46.760
-Different priorities.
-Gets a job in America, never looks back.

1:01:46.840 --> 1:01:48.760
-Like I didn't exist.
-He loved you though.

1:01:48.840 --> 1:01:50.880
He didn't try and find me
when he came back.

1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:53.400
He did. Loads of times.

1:01:54.040 --> 1:01:56.640
But the letters always got returned.
Hang on.

1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:01.520
Here you go.

1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:07.400
What…

1:02:07.960 --> 1:02:10.240
But… but this is the wrong address.

1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:12.040
We moved after he left.

1:02:12.120 --> 1:02:15.160
He didn't know that.
He just thought you didn't wanna know him.

1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:19.080
I might not be the best dad in the world,
but I would do anything for my children.

1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:20.960
If these letters had come back to me,

1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:23.600
I would've gone to the ends of the earth
to find my kids.

1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:27.080
He obviously just didn't want to find me.

1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:33.960
Good night, Mary. Good night, Bright.

1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:36.640
-Good night, Billy.

1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:38.720
Good night, donkey number one.
Good night--

1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:41.280
-Please go to sleep.
-Goodnight, Farmer Cunningham.

1:02:51.080 --> 1:02:53.400
Good morning, Mr. Cunningham.

1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:54.840
Come on, sleepyhead.

1:02:54.920 --> 1:02:58.800
Come on now. Come on. Me and the kids
are going wild swimming. Wanna come?

1:02:58.880 --> 1:03:01.800
-It's brilliant for your circulation.
-I've told you. I can't!

1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:03.560
My boss could turn up any day now.

1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:05.800
It's the weekend.
Bosses don't work weekends.

1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:09.920
We've got lots of activities lined up,
and tonight is the Christmas fair.

1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:12.440
No, she's on the warpath.
She wants my blood.

1:03:12.520 --> 1:03:15.240
Oh, fine, go and stew
in your own work juice,

1:03:15.320 --> 1:03:17.520
and do not forget
that Christmas tree, okay?

1:03:17.600 --> 1:03:21.000
The village square won't be the same
without it. Capisce? Thank you.

1:03:22.920 --> 1:03:23.760
What?

1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:30.760
Sorry, Popsicle. I guess
I'm not the son you wanted me to be,

1:03:30.840 --> 1:03:33.400
but you weren't exactly the dad
I wanted either.

1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:40.000
Not you again. You see this?

1:03:40.080 --> 1:03:44.720
<i>This </i>is the answer to all my prayers,
and you will be out of my life forever.

1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:46.360
Right. Give me that back.

1:03:46.440 --> 1:03:48.200
-Let go of it.

1:03:48.280 --> 1:03:50.480
-Right. I need…

1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:52.720
Right. Come here. Come back. Come back!

1:03:52.800 --> 1:03:56.760
Oh, it's lovely!
It's lovely and warm. Yes, you're in!

1:03:56.840 --> 1:03:58.960
Woo-hoo!

1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:03.320
Just give me the leaflet. Come on.
We're friends, aren't we? Old friends.

1:04:03.400 --> 1:04:05.360
Give me that. Yes! Ha ha!

1:04:05.440 --> 1:04:08.400
Thought you could outsmart
Matt Cunningham? Well, you can't,

1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:09.680
because these guys…

1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:13.040
Hang on. Give that back. Oi, hang on.
Give me that back!

1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:14.840
Right. Give it. Come here!

1:04:14.920 --> 1:04:19.080
Give me that! Where's he going?
Come here. I've got you! Come here!

1:04:19.160 --> 1:04:22.520
And that is how you do it.

1:04:26.640 --> 1:04:27.480
Yes?

1:04:27.560 --> 1:04:29.840
I need some of your mistletoe,
the magic stuff.

1:04:29.920 --> 1:04:32.680
-What?
-The stuff that makes 'em want to kiss!

1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:35.320
Sorry, I'm in the middle of something.
Come back later?

1:04:35.400 --> 1:04:38.280
It might be too late.
She might've gone off with someone else!

1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:40.840
Gone off with… Here. Here. Take this.

1:04:40.920 --> 1:04:42.960
Thank you!

1:04:44.480 --> 1:04:47.000
Welcome to the Cobbledon Players.

1:04:47.080 --> 1:04:49.680
I think it's fair of me to say
that my productions here

1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:51.680
are really pretty legendary.

1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:53.280
Now let's just start off

1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:57.240
by getting you to tell me what
acting experience you've got. Anybody?

1:04:57.320 --> 1:04:59.840
I was going to be
in the Christmas play at school.

1:04:59.920 --> 1:05:02.840
I'm afraid "going to be"
doesn't quite cut the mustard.

1:05:02.920 --> 1:05:04.320
When I was in <i>The Mousetrap…</i>

1:05:05.880 --> 1:05:12.840
<i>…</i>what we would always do is we would
elongate our words for dramatic effect.

1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:17.280
We'd also leave great big, long pauses
after every three or four words.

1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:19.880
Then we'd have lots of double takes.

1:05:19.960 --> 1:05:22.160
I'll show you this actually.
Listen and learn.

1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:24.600
I am a genie,

1:05:24.680 --> 1:05:28.080
and I live in a lamp.

1:05:28.160 --> 1:05:29.120
But look!

1:05:30.560 --> 1:05:31.680
Who goes there?

1:05:32.440 --> 1:05:33.560
Could it be

1:05:35.080 --> 1:05:36.160
Aladdin?

1:05:37.240 --> 1:05:38.840
Now let's give you a little go.

1:05:39.440 --> 1:05:41.240
I am a genie,

1:05:41.320 --> 1:05:43.840
and I live in a lamp.

1:05:43.920 --> 1:05:45.800
You see, I didn't believe a word of that.

1:05:45.880 --> 1:05:47.600
Lovely. You will go far.

1:05:47.680 --> 1:05:50.640
Gerald, maybe we should focus more
on the hoedown this year.

1:05:50.720 --> 1:05:53.760
We can teach them
how to speak hoedown and line dancing.

1:05:53.840 --> 1:05:54.880
But my production--

1:05:54.960 --> 1:05:58.520
Can take a backseat this year,
for the sake of the children.

1:05:58.600 --> 1:06:00.800
You all want to be
part of the hoedown, right?

1:06:00.880 --> 1:06:03.000
-Yes.
-Oh, absolutely!

1:06:03.080 --> 1:06:04.800
If you wanna go to the hoedown,

1:06:04.880 --> 1:06:07.760
we need to teach you how to walk the walk
and talk the talk.

1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:09.200
Hit it!

1:06:12.440 --> 1:06:16.280
Come on, everybody. Clap your hands.
It's the Cobbledon Christmas hoedown.

1:06:16.360 --> 1:06:19.640
Now, y'all need to be hoedown ready
for the Cobbledon Hoedown Snowdown.

1:06:19.720 --> 1:06:21.520
-Say Cobbledon.
-Cobbledon!

1:06:21.600 --> 1:06:22.600
Say Christmas!

1:06:22.680 --> 1:06:23.640
Christmas!

1:06:23.720 --> 1:06:25.840
-Say Cobbledon Christmas!
-Cobbledon Christmas!

1:06:25.920 --> 1:06:27.560
-Say hoedown!
-Hoedown!

1:06:27.640 --> 1:06:29.360
-Say snowdown!
-Snowdown!

1:06:29.440 --> 1:06:30.880
-Say yee-haw!
-Yee-haw!

1:06:30.960 --> 1:06:33.000
-Say ooga-ooga-ooga!
-Ooga-ooga-ooga!

1:06:33.080 --> 1:06:35.040
-Say buckaroo!
-Buckaroo!

1:06:35.120 --> 1:06:36.840
Now you're speakin' hoedown too.

1:06:57.160 --> 1:06:59.360
Barney tells us
your barn roof needs fixing.

1:06:59.440 --> 1:07:01.800
Happy to take a look,
see if we can fix it up.

1:07:01.880 --> 1:07:05.320
There's no point fixing the roof
when the barn's gonna get knocked down.

1:07:05.400 --> 1:07:08.160
-Knocked down?
-That's the phone, the office.

1:07:08.240 --> 1:07:09.160
So I've got to…

1:07:09.240 --> 1:07:11.200
But thank you for your interest.

1:07:22.160 --> 1:07:23.360
Ooh!

1:07:27.160 --> 1:07:28.200
Yee-haw!

1:07:30.240 --> 1:07:33.160
Mr. Cunningham's gonna
knock the barn down, tear it all down!

1:07:39.480 --> 1:07:41.960
"I hope you will make a visit
to Mistletoe Farm

1:07:42.040 --> 1:07:45.960
at your earliest convenience
so that we can make an acceptable deal

1:07:46.040 --> 1:07:49.320
and I can hand over the property to you
for redevelopment

1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:50.720
as soon as possible."

1:07:50.800 --> 1:07:52.480
"Yours sincerely, Mr. Cunningham."

1:07:57.360 --> 1:08:00.120
Oyez, oyez!

1:08:00.200 --> 1:08:03.240
Welcome to the village Christmas fair!

1:08:03.320 --> 1:08:05.120
He's here with the tree!

1:08:05.720 --> 1:08:08.440
Your dad's here, kids. Go!
Come on, let's go and see him.

1:08:09.040 --> 1:08:11.080
Yes. Quick, quick, quick, quick!

1:08:11.160 --> 1:08:13.920
Oyez, oyez!

1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:15.360
Now for the main event.

1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:19.200
The generous donation
of the Christmas tree from Mistletoe Farm!

1:08:50.040 --> 1:08:51.760
That is not a forest tree.

1:08:51.840 --> 1:08:53.680
Hey, that's from our school.

1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:56.040
-We gave it to you.
-That's <i>our </i>tree.

1:08:57.760 --> 1:08:59.320
Oyez, oyez.

1:08:59.400 --> 1:09:01.000
He is a traitor.

1:09:01.840 --> 1:09:03.720
He's selling the farm to the developers!

1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:04.760
-What?
-No!

1:09:04.840 --> 1:09:05.680
No!

1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:07.640
Okay, I've spoken to the developers.

1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:10.400
I've made an appointment,
and they're going to buy the farm,

1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:12.960
and there's nothing
that any of you can do about it.

1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:15.400
Mr. Cunningham,
you may have given up on us,

1:09:15.480 --> 1:09:17.280
but we refuse to give up on you.

1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:18.200
Yes.

1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:21.280
And I made that jumper for you
with your face on it.

1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:23.920
What…

1:09:25.720 --> 1:09:26.680
Huh.

1:09:26.760 --> 1:09:28.680
-Is that meant to be me?
-It's flattering.

1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:30.880
How does this look anything like me?

1:09:31.760 --> 1:09:34.160
-I wouldn't put this on a goat!
-It wouldn't fit it.

1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:37.160
They say it takes a village
to raise a child, Mr. Cunningham.

1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:41.040
This village is raising yours.
The least you can say is thank you.

1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:42.040
Yeah.

1:09:44.040 --> 1:09:46.080
-Kids, we're going.
-I don't want to go!

1:09:46.160 --> 1:09:47.080
Guys.

1:09:47.160 --> 1:09:48.600
I don't wanna go, Dad.

1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:50.680
Go and get in the car.

1:09:55.040 --> 1:09:55.960
Fine.

1:09:58.920 --> 1:10:01.160
We can't just let him sell the farm.

1:10:01.240 --> 1:10:04.840
The village without a farm
will be like Cobbledon without Christmas.

1:10:04.920 --> 1:10:06.440
I say we stage a protest.

1:10:06.520 --> 1:10:08.880
We can appeal
to Mr. Cunningham's sensitive side.

1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:11.720
He doesn't have a sensitive side
from what I can see.

1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:14.480
You know what they say
about killing with kindness.

1:10:14.560 --> 1:10:16.600
Let's show him how really kind we can be.

1:10:16.680 --> 1:10:19.040
I don't think he realizes
how much he needs us,

1:10:19.120 --> 1:10:21.840
and he's gonna be so lonely
this Christmas.

1:10:57.600 --> 1:10:59.800
Okay, well, thank you. That's very… nice.

1:11:31.360 --> 1:11:33.360
Okay, thank you, kids. Inside.

1:11:35.920 --> 1:11:38.360
They were the only ones
that could sing in tune.

1:11:38.440 --> 1:11:39.360
-Oh!
-What?

1:11:43.800 --> 1:11:45.480
Meet me in the barn first thing.

1:11:45.560 --> 1:11:48.880
We're gonna stop those developers.
Make sure you tell the others.

1:11:48.960 --> 1:11:50.320
-Yes.
-Yes.

1:11:53.240 --> 1:11:54.480
Get down.

1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:55.960
We've spotted the vehicles.

1:11:56.040 --> 1:12:00.760
I repeat, we've spotted the vehicles.
Enemy incoming. I repeat, enemy incoming.

1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:02.480
You've got to turn it on, Beano.

1:12:02.560 --> 1:12:05.600
Enemies incoming.
Get to your positions ASAP.

1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:07.360
H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P.

1:12:07.440 --> 1:12:08.440
-Now!
-Now!

1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:10.080
Okay. Over and out.

1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:20.560
Ugh.

1:12:21.240 --> 1:12:24.200
Hello. Ah, you found it okay.

1:12:24.280 --> 1:12:26.160
-Mr. Cunningham, hi.
-Hi, Mr. Cunningham.

1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:28.520
-Marlon.
-He's Marlon Morris. I'm Louis.

1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:29.720
-Louis Drake.
-That's me.

1:12:29.800 --> 1:12:34.360
-Okay. Love the place. It stinks.
-It stinks. It reeks. Must be intolerable.

1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:35.800
-Poor man.
-Oh, your nostrils!

1:12:35.880 --> 1:12:37.240
-Ugh!
-Ugh!

1:12:37.320 --> 1:12:39.640
-Wanna start in the house?
-Let's. Come on, boys.

1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:42.360
Good idea. Nice to be back.
Love to your papa.

1:12:42.440 --> 1:12:43.320
Ow!

1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:46.080
Charlie is go. Repeat, Charlie is go.

1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:50.640
Cunningham, the contract. We'd love you
to just pop your signature there.

1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:53.120
Have a skim.
Don't worry about the small print.

1:12:53.200 --> 1:12:55.400
It's fine.
I don't need to read the small print.

1:12:55.480 --> 1:12:57.680
I'm happy to see the back of this place.

1:12:57.760 --> 1:13:01.160
Absolutely perfect.
Now, listen, before we sign, I'd just…

1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:03.680
-I'd love to have another look round.
-Yeah. No, fine.

1:13:03.760 --> 1:13:06.240
-I can just store it safely over here.
-Okay.

1:13:06.320 --> 1:13:08.520
-This is the kitchen?
-Yep.

1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:09.640
-Oh!
-Oh.

1:13:09.720 --> 1:13:10.640
Oh gosh!

1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:11.880
-That's…
-What is that?

1:13:11.960 --> 1:13:13.360
It's quite a smell, isn't it?

1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:16.360
-Trust me. It's just rotten eggs.
-That is horrific!

1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:18.760
It's the poisonous mold
from the sewer pit below.

1:13:18.840 --> 1:13:20.760
-What?
-What did you say?

1:13:20.840 --> 1:13:23.160
-Didn't you tell them about the sewer pit?
-No!

1:13:23.240 --> 1:13:25.360
There is categorically
no sewer pit under the--

1:13:28.520 --> 1:13:30.160
-What is this?
-It's toxic! Agh!

1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:32.760
-What is this?
-That is not poisonous.

1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:35.120
It's in my eyes!

1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:46.000
Look, I am sorry about before.
As you can see, it's a spacious bedroom.

1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:47.800
Yeah, no probs. We'll move on.

1:13:47.880 --> 1:13:50.520
-Do you wanna--
-Take some measurements? Love to.

1:13:51.040 --> 1:13:53.400
What's this?
We've got a… Okay.

1:13:53.480 --> 1:13:55.560
-What is that?
-Oh gosh!

1:13:55.640 --> 1:13:56.760
-What is that?
-A pig.

1:13:56.840 --> 1:13:58.760
-Why is there a pig there?
-I don't know.

1:13:58.840 --> 1:14:01.480
-Who keeps a pig in a wardrobe?
-Why is there a pig?

1:14:04.560 --> 1:14:08.680
Leave the farm alone! Hey!
Leave the farm alone! Hey!

1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:11.040
So this is the barn, just up here.

1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:13.120
The animals spend
most of their time in here.

1:14:13.200 --> 1:14:14.520
They absolutely love it.

1:14:14.600 --> 1:14:17.280
A lot of the original features up here,
which is nice.

1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:18.560
Well, this is it.

1:14:18.640 --> 1:14:20.200
Oh, yeah, it's lovely.

1:14:20.920 --> 1:14:23.400
-Let's knock it down.
-Maybe a boutique hotel.

1:14:23.480 --> 1:14:25.720
Well, no, 'cause the anim…
It doesn't matter.

1:14:25.800 --> 1:14:28.000
-Have a look round, and I'll pop back.
-Yeah.

1:14:28.080 --> 1:14:29.240
-Yeah. Okay, fine.
-Yeah.

1:14:29.320 --> 1:14:30.480
Yeah, see ya.

1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:31.720
-Drake.
-Yeah.

1:14:31.800 --> 1:14:33.560
-Animals.
-Livestock.

1:14:33.640 --> 1:14:36.320
-Who's a little pork chop?

1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:38.920
-Cute.
-Oh, oh!

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:39.880
Stop, stop!

1:14:40.960 --> 1:14:42.840
Put it… Put it down.

1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:45.880
-I can't see!
-You're fine. It's fine. A little lamb.

1:14:47.200 --> 1:14:50.400
Hello, little lamb.
Can you say "mint sauce"?

1:14:51.720 --> 1:14:54.200
Can you say
"medium rare with onion gravy"?

1:14:55.680 --> 1:14:56.920
<i>Un, deux, trois!</i>

1:14:59.720 --> 1:15:02.080
-Drake! Drake!

1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:06.160
Leave the farm alone! Hey!
Leave the farm alone! Hey!

1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:09.640
I mean, so this is everything.
There is a wood down there.

1:15:09.720 --> 1:15:12.200
We have crops over there,
some sprouts or something.

1:15:12.280 --> 1:15:17.280
Yeah. I can see ice rink,
theme park, retail park. What do you see?

1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:19.640
I can't see anything
after what we've been through.

1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:21.320
It's been an absolute nightmare.

1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:27.760
Come on! Traitor!

1:15:29.480 --> 1:15:32.520
-Cobbledon, Cobbledon-ooga!
-Ooga!

1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:35.600
And get off of our land,
or we'll get you off!

1:15:35.680 --> 1:15:38.640
Don't worry. It's just the local yokels,
the village people.

1:15:38.720 --> 1:15:43.240
We've had worse protesters than this.
These are little people with little lives!

1:15:43.320 --> 1:15:46.040
-Little people? Hold my coat.
-No, no, no, no!

1:15:46.120 --> 1:15:49.760
-This land is not for taking!
-Don't worry about her.

1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:53.320
-She's the head of the knitting circle.
-No surrender!

1:15:55.320 --> 1:15:56.360
-Ugh!
-Ugh!

1:15:57.080 --> 1:15:58.120
Ugh!

1:15:58.200 --> 1:15:59.560
Charge!

1:16:01.040 --> 1:16:02.760
Let's be havin' you!

1:16:10.160 --> 1:16:12.680
Barry, what the hell are you playing at?

1:16:12.760 --> 1:16:14.720
Trying to do
what's best for our community.

1:16:14.800 --> 1:16:18.120
-You won't scare them off that easy.
-We might not, but they will.

1:16:19.560 --> 1:16:21.040
Oh my…

1:16:31.440 --> 1:16:32.280
Bye-bye!

1:16:39.360 --> 1:16:41.080
That's it, get out!

1:16:41.160 --> 1:16:43.640
-Faster!
-Get them!

1:16:43.720 --> 1:16:46.520
-Go on!
-Get off our farm!

1:16:48.840 --> 1:16:50.000
Yes!

1:16:50.720 --> 1:16:52.600
No! Do not sign that, Farmer Cunningham.

1:16:52.680 --> 1:16:54.880
<i>I </i>have already signed it. They didn't,

1:16:54.960 --> 1:16:57.720
and now they don't want
to buy the farm, thanks to you.

1:16:57.800 --> 1:16:59.840
You can't go back to being all work.

1:16:59.920 --> 1:17:03.920
Real life is not fresh air
and talking to chickens, Beano, okay?

1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:07.040
-People's jobs are at stake!
-Your kids' happiness is too.

1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:09.760
-My kids are fine.
-They miss their mum.

1:17:10.600 --> 1:17:12.760
But they miss their dad more.

1:17:12.840 --> 1:17:14.960
This is business, Beano.

1:17:15.040 --> 1:17:16.840
Kids don't count!

1:17:16.920 --> 1:17:17.880
We don't count?

1:17:19.200 --> 1:17:22.120
No, I… Well, it was… I was…

1:17:24.320 --> 1:17:27.480
Oh, well, thank you. Thank you very much!

1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:32.200
This had better be the best pitch
Cunningham has written,

1:17:32.280 --> 1:17:35.560
because if it's not,
he will be losing a lot more than his job,

1:17:35.640 --> 1:17:38.120
if you know what I mean.

1:17:39.480 --> 1:17:41.920
-What's that?
-That's a sheep. You know…

1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:43.120
Them ones.

1:17:44.400 --> 1:17:47.120
Ugh! What's that noxious smell?

1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:49.120
Oh, it's the countryside air!

1:17:49.200 --> 1:17:51.640
What are you doing?

1:17:51.720 --> 1:17:55.120
-I don't like it!

1:17:55.200 --> 1:17:57.840
-Looks like we've seen 'em off!

1:17:57.920 --> 1:17:59.440
Oh, maybe I spoke too soon.

1:17:59.520 --> 1:18:02.960
There's more of them!
They're all coming out of the woodwork!

1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:03.920
Boo!

1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.840
Where is he? Where's Matthew?
What have you done with him?

1:18:06.920 --> 1:18:09.680
-We don't want you here! We've had enough!
-Aye.

1:18:09.760 --> 1:18:13.080
I have driven
all the way from London to here,

1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:14.480
and I demand to see him now!

1:18:14.560 --> 1:18:17.760
We know exactly where you've come from,
same place as the last idiots.

1:18:17.840 --> 1:18:19.040
-Excuse me?
-Whoa!

1:18:19.120 --> 1:18:22.240
-We don't want any trouble.
-Then you've come to the wrong place.

1:18:24.320 --> 1:18:27.280
-What's that?
-A pig. The ones that…

1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:29.280
-Them ones.
-Yes. Just get rid of it!

1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:31.520
-Get rid of it?
-Oh, I'll do it myself!

1:18:31.600 --> 1:18:35.240
-I was gonna try and--
-Don't you dare spray perfume at that pig!

1:18:35.320 --> 1:18:38.960
Miss Fletcher.
Ignore these… yokels and come inside.

1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:42.440
-Yes, yes.

1:18:42.520 --> 1:18:45.880
There's no point in buying a farm
if you don't like the smell of manure.

1:18:45.960 --> 1:18:48.840
That pig's got more right to be here
than you!

1:18:48.920 --> 1:18:51.840
Agh, God, they're multiplying!

1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:53.760
Get away from me, you filthy swine!

1:19:01.080 --> 1:19:03.920
Miss Fletcher, I'm so sorry!
Mo, please get her out of the mud.

1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:05.600
D'you… Do you wanna?

1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:07.200
-You're fired.
-Please, don't--

1:19:07.280 --> 1:19:08.400
You are sacked.

1:19:08.480 --> 1:19:11.600
You are dismissed with immediate effect.

1:19:11.680 --> 1:19:16.400
I ain't gonna sugarcoat it.
You're gone. Now, Mo, heave me up!

1:19:16.480 --> 1:19:19.480
Please! I've been working on the pitch.
It's really good!

1:19:19.560 --> 1:19:22.440
-I like what you've done.
-I need this job!

1:19:22.520 --> 1:19:27.520
-Sorry it didn't work out, yeah?
-Mr. Cunningham. I would like a refund.

1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:30.200
-What?
-My one didn't work!

1:19:30.720 --> 1:19:32.520
I don't know what you're talking about!

1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:36.640
Oh, Grumpy!

1:19:39.960 --> 1:19:41.760
-Mr. Cunningham.
-Okay, you.

1:19:41.840 --> 1:19:44.320
You see that woman out there?
She's not a developer.

1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:46.480
She's my boss, okay? And now I'm sacked.

1:19:46.560 --> 1:19:49.920
So that's gone. That job has gone,
and it is… It's all your fault.

1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:54.040
-I'm sorry, Mr. Cunningham.
-No! You don't get to be sorry right now.

1:19:54.120 --> 1:19:56.040
After everything
my kids have been through,

1:19:56.120 --> 1:19:58.000
I can't even put a roof over their heads.

1:19:58.080 --> 1:20:00.720
-I can fix the roof.
-Not this roof!

1:20:00.800 --> 1:20:01.920
In our home.

1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:05.880
In our real home, with real people,
in London where we live,

1:20:05.960 --> 1:20:08.160
where I now can't afford
to pay the mortgage

1:20:08.240 --> 1:20:09.440
'cause I don't have a job!

1:20:09.520 --> 1:20:10.880
I'll sort everything.

1:20:10.960 --> 1:20:15.640
No, no. You… you have ruined everything.

1:20:16.400 --> 1:20:19.880
You know, you need to,
um, pack your bags and your hay,

1:20:19.960 --> 1:20:21.360
and… and get out!

1:20:21.440 --> 1:20:24.480
Okay? Because you…
you don't live here anymore.

1:20:55.520 --> 1:20:56.880
I'm gonna miss you guys.

1:20:58.080 --> 1:20:59.160
But I've gotta go.

1:20:59.680 --> 1:21:03.040
I've messed up big time, okay?
I'm gonna put it right.

1:21:03.120 --> 1:21:04.560
We're gonna miss you, Beano.

1:21:05.800 --> 1:21:09.520
I don't want you to go, Beano.
I don't want you to go.

1:21:11.680 --> 1:21:14.720
I just brought Kayla and Kayan
to say goodbye to the children.

1:21:30.880 --> 1:21:33.840
-Have you got a minute?
-Uh, okay.

1:21:34.360 --> 1:21:37.880
The children are really upset,
and what you did to Beano…

1:21:37.960 --> 1:21:39.080
What I did to Beano.

1:21:39.160 --> 1:21:43.640
When I said education comes in many forms,
I didn't just mean the children.

1:21:43.720 --> 1:21:45.920
-I meant yours too.
-Right.

1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:48.600
Learning is for life,
not just for Christmas.

1:21:48.680 --> 1:21:51.120
The children have learnt
so many things here.

1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:56.040
They've learnt to knit, to crochet,
to sew, to sing, to have courage,

1:21:56.120 --> 1:21:57.280
and to belong.

1:21:58.280 --> 1:22:00.560
But when you took
that school Christmas tree

1:22:00.640 --> 1:22:03.520
that the children gave you
from the bottom of their hearts

1:22:03.600 --> 1:22:06.080
and presented it back to them
as some sort of trick,

1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:07.640
they felt betrayed.

1:22:07.720 --> 1:22:11.680
-That's not what I was trying to do.
-You know Violet's star was on that tree?

1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:13.680
The one that she made for her mum.

1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:16.200
Well, that star got lost in transit,

1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:18.760
because you were too busy
to do the right thing

1:22:18.840 --> 1:22:21.400
and go and cut down
that tree in the woods.

1:22:22.320 --> 1:22:25.520
Doing the right thing is something
we teach children here in Cobbledon.

1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:29.440
So you may not appreciate
our village school or our village ways

1:22:29.520 --> 1:22:30.840
or our village people,

1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:34.680
but we care for your children
with all our hearts.

1:22:34.760 --> 1:22:35.880
And so does Beano.

1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:39.000
Maybe there's a lesson for you in that.

1:22:49.920 --> 1:22:53.480
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I am sorry that I threw out Beano, but I…

1:22:54.840 --> 1:22:58.080
Oh, come on. Look…
He's going to be fine, I promise you.

1:22:58.160 --> 1:23:01.480
He's from the countryside.
The countryside is his home.

1:23:01.560 --> 1:23:04.400
<i>This </i>is his home! This is all our homes!

1:23:38.840 --> 1:23:39.760
Beano.

1:23:42.680 --> 1:23:43.760
Hello, son.

1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:44.680
Mum?

1:23:45.400 --> 1:23:46.520
Here.

1:23:46.600 --> 1:23:49.640
I'm so sorry.
I should've told you. I should…

1:23:50.360 --> 1:23:53.560
I should've given you
the letters and the presents.

1:23:53.640 --> 1:23:56.240
Wait. So, you sent everything back to him?

1:23:56.320 --> 1:23:58.760
Yes. He'd never turn up at Christmastime.

1:23:58.840 --> 1:24:01.000
Your little face waiting.
He'd never turn up.

1:24:01.080 --> 1:24:04.560
He was upsetting us all the time.
I didn't want any more of that.

1:24:14.840 --> 1:24:17.560
<i>"Dear son, today will be</i>
<i>your seventh birthday,</i>

1:24:17.640 --> 1:24:19.160
<i>and I really hope you are happy."</i>

1:24:19.240 --> 1:24:21.720
<i>"Dear son, today will be</i>
<i>your eighth birthday."</i>

1:24:21.800 --> 1:24:23.200
<i>"Soon it will be Christmas."</i>

1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:25.040
<i>"Today will be your ninth birthday,</i>

1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:27.760
<i>and never a day goes by</i>
<i>when I don't wonder how you are."</i>

1:24:27.840 --> 1:24:30.080
<i>"Today will be your 11th birthday,</i>

1:24:30.160 --> 1:24:33.720
<i>and I've enclosed a little gift for you</i>
<i>as it's so close to Christmas."</i>

1:24:34.280 --> 1:24:36.560
<i>"I thought that you might</i>
<i>like this snow globe."</i>

1:24:37.080 --> 1:24:40.520
<i>"Every time you shake it up,</i>
<i>I hope that you will think of me."</i>

1:24:42.320 --> 1:24:48.320
"Dear Santa, please keep Beano safe,
and ask Rudolph to look after him,

1:24:48.400 --> 1:24:51.000
and please get Daddy to change his mind."

1:24:51.080 --> 1:24:53.680
"And help us
spend time with our dad."

1:24:53.760 --> 1:24:58.520
"Help him to stop working
so we can show him he can be happy again."

1:25:22.040 --> 1:25:23.720
Oh no! The animals have escaped!

1:25:23.800 --> 1:25:26.200
Someone left the gate open
at the top field!

1:25:28.760 --> 1:25:32.280
Something's wrong at Mistletoe Farm.
I've got the children on the phone.

1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:39.840
I'll get the horse, you get the quads.

1:25:39.920 --> 1:25:42.440
-Stay as close to me as you can, okay?
-Okay!

1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:52.440
-Come back!

1:26:13.840 --> 1:26:17.000
You left the gate open!
Animals have gone onto the road.

1:26:17.080 --> 1:26:17.920
What?

1:26:18.440 --> 1:26:21.840
Okay, look, we have to find Beano.
He can't have got that far.

1:26:22.600 --> 1:26:25.640
Okay, come on. Let's do this.

1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:31.480
So you see, Miss Fletcher,
none of this was Mr. Cunningham's fault.

1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:32.840
Has it stopped talking?

1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:36.600
Have we finished? Have we quite finished?

1:26:36.680 --> 1:26:39.400
Look. He's worked really hard
on his pitch.

1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:41.120
<i>That's </i>the pitch?

1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:45.880
It's not what a pitch looks like on paper
but what a pitch has to say that counts.

1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:49.400
-Would you like me to read it to you?
-Go on then. Entertain me!

1:26:52.400 --> 1:26:53.440
Sorry, bit nervous.

1:26:53.520 --> 1:26:54.480
Get on with it.

1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:57.240
"You're expecting
a big, impressive speech."

1:26:57.320 --> 1:26:58.400
Yes, we are.

1:26:58.480 --> 1:27:01.320
"But I want you
to think about the little guy, like Mo."

1:27:01.400 --> 1:27:02.600
Hey!

1:27:02.680 --> 1:27:06.040
"At Fletcher Consultants,
we always look at the big picture."

1:27:06.120 --> 1:27:08.120
"We are always thinking global,

1:27:08.200 --> 1:27:11.400
but sometimes
we miss the things that matter most."

1:27:11.920 --> 1:27:14.680
"The people that matter most."

1:27:14.760 --> 1:27:15.720
"The butcher."

1:27:17.040 --> 1:27:17.960
"The baker."

1:27:18.040 --> 1:27:19.600
"The candlestick maker."

1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:22.480
"The farmer. The father."

1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:24.920
"The cleaner."

1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:26.440
"The dreamer."

1:27:26.520 --> 1:27:27.360
"The teacher."

1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:30.240
"The goat."

1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:34.400
"The little people
that make up the big picture."

1:27:34.920 --> 1:27:36.920
"People like us."

1:27:50.920 --> 1:27:55.000
Rural Estates.
Doesn't look very rural, does it, Rudolph?

1:27:55.920 --> 1:27:59.040
Developers. Developers!

1:27:59.560 --> 1:28:01.240
-Developers!
-Sorry, no change.

1:28:01.320 --> 1:28:04.560
No, no, no, it's me.
It's Beano, from Mistletoe Farm.

1:28:04.640 --> 1:28:06.320
-Absolutely not.
-No, no, no.

1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:08.160
No, sir. Absolutely not.

1:28:08.240 --> 1:28:10.240
No, I'm here to sell it. I ju…

1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:12.480
Are you joking?

1:28:13.560 --> 1:28:15.800
Why would we go back
to that treacherous place?

1:28:15.880 --> 1:28:17.520
I still smell of egg.

1:28:18.120 --> 1:28:19.640
Now, listen, Marlon,

1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:21.920
what are you doing here
listening to this buffoon

1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:23.800
after everything he put us through?

1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:28.160
None of that was Mr. Cunningham's fault.
It was all my fault, and the kids.

1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:30.680
We tried to sabotage the farm
so you wouldn't buy it.

1:28:30.760 --> 1:28:34.200
But look, Mr. Cunningham
really wants to sell now. He does.

1:28:34.280 --> 1:28:35.320
He signed here.

1:28:35.400 --> 1:28:38.320
All you need to do is sign here and here,
and the deal is done.

1:28:51.800 --> 1:28:55.000
Come on, Rudolph.
Well, here you go. It's all yours.

1:28:55.520 --> 1:28:57.920
-If we could get the deeds and keys.
-Keys, please.

1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:00.560
I'm gonna tell the animals
you're gonna treat them right.

1:29:01.080 --> 1:29:04.200
Uh, sorry, you…
He's just gonna tell the… animals.

1:29:04.280 --> 1:29:06.040
-Is he okay?

1:29:06.120 --> 1:29:07.640
-Mr. B!
-Mr. Cunningham!

1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:11.520
-Where is everyone?
-What?

1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:13.200
-Where is everyone?
-Who?

1:29:13.280 --> 1:29:14.200
-Itsy!
-What?

1:29:14.280 --> 1:29:15.880
-What's Itsy?
-Weenie!

1:29:15.960 --> 1:29:17.640
-Who's Weenie?
-Mary!

1:29:17.720 --> 1:29:18.560
Mary!

1:29:18.640 --> 1:29:19.960
Bright! Bright!

1:29:20.560 --> 1:29:22.520
Where is everyone? Where is everyone?

1:29:23.040 --> 1:29:24.960
Beano! Beano!

1:29:25.040 --> 1:29:27.240
-Beano!
-Beano!

1:29:27.320 --> 1:29:28.680
-Seen Beano?
-No.

1:29:30.080 --> 1:29:31.440
Sorry, okay, come on.

1:29:31.520 --> 1:29:32.800
Beano!

1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:34.600
There you are. Who are we looking for?

1:29:34.680 --> 1:29:37.320
-We're looking for Itsy, Bitsy…
-Teenie and Weenie?

1:29:37.400 --> 1:29:40.600
You, Beano! We've been looking for you.
Is that my jacket?

1:29:40.680 --> 1:29:42.560
-I'm here now.
-What are they doing here?

1:29:42.640 --> 1:29:45.200
-We bought the farm!
-They've signed the contract.

1:29:45.280 --> 1:29:47.480
You do not have to live
in Cobbledon anymore.

1:29:47.560 --> 1:29:50.120
-The farm belongs to them.
-I want to live in Cobbledon!

1:29:50.200 --> 1:29:54.840
I want to stay here with my children,
and you, and… and Miss Ashley.

1:29:54.920 --> 1:29:56.560
-What are you talking about?
-Beano!

1:29:56.640 --> 1:29:59.280
-What's going on?
-Beano!

1:29:59.360 --> 1:30:00.880
-What?
-I know, okay? And I…

1:30:00.960 --> 1:30:02.680
I don't have time to explain that now.

1:30:02.760 --> 1:30:05.400
The animals have all escaped.
My bad. I left the gate open.

1:30:05.480 --> 1:30:08.200
-You ignored the country code.
-Never mind about that!

1:30:08.280 --> 1:30:10.480
We need to find the animals
before they get hurt.

1:30:10.560 --> 1:30:14.160
-Everybody, quiet!

1:30:14.240 --> 1:30:15.240
I can hear bells.

1:30:16.120 --> 1:30:18.440
Rudolph. Jingle bells, where?

1:30:18.520 --> 1:30:20.480
-The woods.

1:30:21.640 --> 1:30:24.200
-To the woods, everyone! The woods!

1:30:24.280 --> 1:30:25.480
-Let's go!
-Quick!

1:30:25.560 --> 1:30:27.000
-To… the woods.
-To the woods.

1:30:30.200 --> 1:30:31.120
I'm… It's…

1:30:32.400 --> 1:30:33.280
Wait a second.

1:30:39.080 --> 1:30:39.920
To the woods.

1:30:40.640 --> 1:30:42.480
-Jingle!
-Jingle!

1:30:43.720 --> 1:30:45.800
This way. This way, this way.

1:30:48.320 --> 1:30:49.320
Jingle!

1:30:50.760 --> 1:30:52.720
Everybody, quiet! Quiet!

1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:56.080
The bell.

1:30:56.160 --> 1:30:58.480
This way. Well done, Rudolph. This way.

1:30:59.160 --> 1:31:00.120
Jingle!

1:31:01.280 --> 1:31:02.960
Jingle! Jingle!

1:31:03.040 --> 1:31:04.080
Jingle!

1:31:04.160 --> 1:31:05.000
Who is Jingle?

1:31:05.080 --> 1:31:06.400
Absolutely no idea.

1:31:06.920 --> 1:31:07.800
Jingle!

1:31:10.400 --> 1:31:12.920
Oh, look, it's Jingle!

1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:17.040
Jingle. Well done, Rudolph. You found him.
Finally you're a real sheep dog!

1:31:17.120 --> 1:31:18.640
Right, I'm going in.

1:31:18.720 --> 1:31:20.440
Mr. Cunningham, hold my legs!

1:31:20.520 --> 1:31:22.400
Okay, well, everybody, hold on.

1:31:22.480 --> 1:31:24.400
Ready. Steady, please.

1:31:24.480 --> 1:31:28.960
After three. One… two… three!

1:31:30.320 --> 1:31:32.400
-Get back.
-Catch him, please!

1:31:32.480 --> 1:31:33.920
-Yeah!
-We've got him!

1:31:34.680 --> 1:31:36.080
Well done, Rudolph.

1:31:53.920 --> 1:31:55.920
-Who are you?
-I'm Matt's mum.

1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:56.880
Nana!

1:31:58.600 --> 1:32:00.360
Nana! Shall we?

1:32:02.560 --> 1:32:03.400
-Right.
-Right.

1:32:03.480 --> 1:32:05.200
-Uh, sit.
-Sit.

1:32:05.880 --> 1:32:07.120
-Ow!
-What?

1:32:07.200 --> 1:32:08.240
Just go on.

1:32:09.600 --> 1:32:11.600
All right, Grumpy?
What are you doing here?

1:32:11.680 --> 1:32:14.640
Before I retired, I was a lawyer,

1:32:15.240 --> 1:32:18.080
and I represented your father,
Mr. Cunningham.

1:32:18.640 --> 1:32:22.920
I'd like to draw your attention
to this special clause in the will.

1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:25.880
-What's a special clause?
-Is it a Santa Claus?

1:32:25.960 --> 1:32:29.680
This special clause stipulates

1:32:29.760 --> 1:32:33.880
that the farm cannot be sold
under any circumstances

1:32:33.960 --> 1:32:36.760
and is only inherited property

1:32:36.840 --> 1:32:41.120
if you stay on the farm
and sustain it for the years to come.

1:32:41.200 --> 1:32:43.240
I'm afraid the farm is not sold

1:32:43.840 --> 1:32:47.400
and never can be,
as long as the family want to stay here.

1:32:47.480 --> 1:32:49.040
We do want to stay here!

1:32:49.120 --> 1:32:50.880
I want to stay here forever!

1:32:50.960 --> 1:32:53.600
Perhaps you'd like
to look through it yourselves.

1:32:53.680 --> 1:32:54.760
Let me see this.

1:32:55.280 --> 1:32:56.280
Look at this!

1:32:56.360 --> 1:32:59.720
-This is just old-fashioned nonsense.

1:32:59.800 --> 1:33:01.840
-It's…

1:33:01.920 --> 1:33:03.680
-It's, uh…

1:33:07.680 --> 1:33:08.880
-Drake.
-Yep.

1:33:10.040 --> 1:33:11.200
-What?
-Yep.

1:33:13.880 --> 1:33:15.160
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:33:15.920 --> 1:33:19.880
Well, I hope you know
this has been some serious time-wasting.

1:33:21.080 --> 1:33:23.280
-And you!
-And you, you!

1:33:23.360 --> 1:33:25.640
You! You, you, you, you.

1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:29.360
You owe us for dry cleaning
and the hospital bills.

1:33:29.440 --> 1:33:31.440
Do you have any idea
how much pain I was in?

1:33:31.520 --> 1:33:35.520
-Would you like me to show you out?
-We're going. Keep your stupid farm!

1:33:35.600 --> 1:33:36.520
Yeah!

1:33:36.600 --> 1:33:38.240
-Out!
-Stinks!

1:33:38.320 --> 1:33:41.320
-The farm is ours!

1:33:41.400 --> 1:33:44.240
Oh, we've got the farm! The farm is ours!

1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:48.160
How are we gonna keep it ours?

1:33:48.840 --> 1:33:53.200
I think I know a way to keep the farm.
Ask the kids about the magic.

1:33:53.280 --> 1:33:54.880
He means the mistletoe.

1:33:54.960 --> 1:33:57.320
What is it
with all this mistletoe business?

1:33:57.400 --> 1:33:58.320
It's magic.

1:33:58.840 --> 1:34:02.280
Okay. I don't think
that mistletoe can be magic, Buster.

1:34:14.360 --> 1:34:15.200
Is that…

1:34:17.880 --> 1:34:19.000
Oh.

1:34:19.080 --> 1:34:20.400
It's the town crier.

1:34:20.480 --> 1:34:22.960
For a minute,
I thought you were Father Christmas.

1:34:23.040 --> 1:34:25.520
I know this is something
you might not want to hear,

1:34:26.560 --> 1:34:29.360
and it's fine
if you can't deal with it right now,

1:34:30.400 --> 1:34:32.440
but I brought you some mistletoe

1:34:33.240 --> 1:34:34.840
from the fields back there.

1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:36.920
Another Christmas gift

1:34:38.200 --> 1:34:41.320
to try and make up
for all the Christmases I've missed.

1:34:43.720 --> 1:34:46.160
Sorry? What? What?

1:34:46.800 --> 1:34:48.120
I know it's a shock.

1:34:49.880 --> 1:34:52.480
What? Are… are you saying, um…

1:34:54.200 --> 1:34:55.120
Hello, son.

1:34:58.040 --> 1:35:01.200
How? I… I mean,
you left me the farm in your will.

1:35:01.280 --> 1:35:02.800
I left you the farm,

1:35:02.880 --> 1:35:05.680
but I never said anything
about being dead.

1:35:06.280 --> 1:35:09.480
And as you can see, I'm alive and well.

1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:10.800
Was everybody in on it?

1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:15.560
I just wanted to bring my family
back together again. I'm so sorry.

1:35:17.720 --> 1:35:19.400
Will you take it, son?

1:35:30.840 --> 1:35:32.960
It's going to change your life.

1:35:50.360 --> 1:35:52.080
Hi, Grandpops.

1:35:52.160 --> 1:35:53.080
Oh!

1:35:53.720 --> 1:35:54.600
Buster!

1:35:55.240 --> 1:35:58.120
How nice to meet you properly at last.

1:36:13.200 --> 1:36:14.120
Big day.

1:36:15.640 --> 1:36:16.800
The biggest.

1:36:16.880 --> 1:36:18.560
It's crazy. I…

1:36:19.560 --> 1:36:20.640
I dunno.

1:36:21.240 --> 1:36:23.840
What you do know is
that everybody loves you.

1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:26.120
Especially me.

1:36:28.440 --> 1:36:32.520
I'm a very patient person.
I mean… Well, I mean, just…

1:36:32.600 --> 1:36:33.440
Oh.

1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:50.480
Yee-haw!
Welcome to this year's Hoedown Snowdown.

1:37:31.680 --> 1:37:33.320
Yee-haw!

1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:38.200
Ooh!

1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:39.800
What are you doing here?

1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:42.600
-We bring good news.
-What?

1:37:42.680 --> 1:37:45.000
-Emblem loved your pitch.
-Mm-hm.

1:37:45.080 --> 1:37:45.920
How?

1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.760
Beano came all the way to London
and showed us the pitch.

1:37:48.840 --> 1:37:51.080
-Mo read it, very well I may add.
-Thank you.

1:37:51.160 --> 1:37:54.920
They loved it! They loved
the whole community aspect of it.

1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:56.440
And there was another word…

1:37:56.520 --> 1:37:57.680
-Heart.
-Heart.

1:37:57.760 --> 1:37:59.360
They loved it. Said it had heart.

1:37:59.440 --> 1:38:02.120
So I want you
to get yourself suited and booted

1:38:02.200 --> 1:38:05.120
and get yourself back to London.
Get out of this place.

1:38:05.200 --> 1:38:07.120
No. I don't really want that job anymore.

1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:09.440
But I am glad
that you two get to keep yours.

1:38:09.520 --> 1:38:13.160
Surely you're not gonna stay <i>here,</i>
are you?

1:38:13.240 --> 1:38:16.480
-Yee-haw! Say Cobbledon!
-Cobbledon!

1:38:16.560 --> 1:38:18.520
-Christmas!
-Christmas!

1:38:18.600 --> 1:38:22.280
-Cobbledon Christmas!
-Cobbledon Christmas!

1:38:22.360 --> 1:38:23.920
-Ooga-ooga-ooga!
-Ooga-ooga-ooga.

1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:25.960
-Beano!
-Beano!

1:38:26.040 --> 1:38:27.920
-Say yes, Beano!
-Yes, Beano!

1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:29.760
-Stage dive!
-Stage dive!

1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:33.120
You gon' catch me?
You gon' catch me, right?

1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:34.560
Here I come!

1:38:34.640 --> 1:38:35.880
Woo!

1:38:41.360 --> 1:38:44.240
Miss Fletcher, it turns out
that kids really do count,

1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:47.720
and I want to spend some time
with my kids, and my children

1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:50.920
and my farmhand, and a very expensive vet,

1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:53.080
because I am coming out.

1:38:53.160 --> 1:38:55.600
I'm coming out as a farmer.

1:38:55.680 --> 1:38:58.160
That's right.
I am now one of the village people.

1:38:58.240 --> 1:39:00.520
-Oh, wow.
-And nothing is gonna stop me!

1:39:04.280 --> 1:39:08.080
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Cunningham
is now one of the village people.

1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:11.280
Let's show him
what us village people can do!

1:40:02.200 --> 1:40:05.320
Follow me! The baby donkey's being born!

1:40:07.640 --> 1:40:10.040
Follow me. Sh.

1:40:14.240 --> 1:40:16.840
So donkey number one and donkey number two

1:40:17.360 --> 1:40:18.920
made donkey number three.
