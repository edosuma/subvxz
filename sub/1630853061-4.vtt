00:07.094 --> 00:08.660
- Most Americans
woke up this morning

00:08.704 --> 00:11.446
to find presidential candidate
Dwayne Johnson

00:11.489 --> 00:14.492
in the middle of a very public
social media feud

00:14.536 --> 00:16.712
with a chiropractor
from Minnesota.

00:16.755 --> 00:19.845
<i>Dr. Julian Echo has been</i>
<i>tweeting at candidate Johnson</i>

00:19.889 --> 00:22.370
<i>since he announced</i>
<i>his run for the presidency,</i>

00:22.413 --> 00:25.938
<i>and last night,</i>
<i>he finally got a response.</i>

00:25.982 --> 00:27.418
<i>Dr. Echo had tweeted,</i>

00:27.462 --> 00:30.334
<i>"Dwayne Johnson</i>
<i>will never be my president.</i>

00:30.378 --> 00:32.771
<i>"Went to school with him.</i>
<i>Bad dude.</i>

00:32.815 --> 00:35.774
<i>The world needs to hear</i>
<i>what I have to say,"</i>

00:35.818 --> 00:37.385
<i>to which Johnson replied,</i>

00:37.428 --> 00:40.040
<i>"30 years later,</i>
<i>and you're still a jabroni!"</i>

00:40.083 --> 00:41.432
<i>Echo replied,</i>

00:41.476 --> 00:43.434
<i>"You stole 'Jabroni'</i>
<i>from the Iron Sheik."</i>

00:43.478 --> 00:45.393
<i>"No, I didn't.</i>

00:45.436 --> 00:48.048
<i>"I asked him if it was okay</i>
<i>for me to use the word,</i>

00:48.091 --> 00:49.527
<i>and he said yes."</i>

00:49.571 --> 00:51.834
"How do we know
<i>that really happened?"</i>

00:51.877 --> 00:56.404
<i>- "Ask the Iron Sheik."</i>
- "I don't want to."

00:56.447 --> 00:58.536
<i>"I hate you."</i>

00:58.580 --> 01:01.626
"I always knew
<i>your heart was black."</i>

01:01.670 --> 01:03.193
<i>And then many more exchanges</i>

01:03.237 --> 01:06.240
<i>that cannot be repeated</i>
<i>on television.</i>

01:06.283 --> 01:07.719
Guys, my bad.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.243
I'm sorry.

01:09.286 --> 01:11.245
- I thought you said
you were doing a crossword.

01:11.288 --> 01:12.898
<i>- Johnson and Echo</i>
<i>were classmates</i>

01:12.942 --> 01:16.815
<i>at Washington Middle School</i>
<i>in Hawaii back in 1984.</i>

01:16.859 --> 01:19.122
- You were just saying
that you wouldn't let anyone

01:19.166 --> 01:20.906
get under your skin
like that anymore.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.865
I know. I know.

01:22.908 --> 01:24.345
It's just so unlike you.

01:24.388 --> 01:25.824
You usually let that kind
of thing roll off your back.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.217
I do usually, yes.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.914
But this kid--
for some reason,

01:28.958 --> 01:31.091
he makes me feel like
I'm 11years old again

01:31.134 --> 01:32.570
and I'm fighting
in the schoolyard.

01:32.614 --> 01:34.833
He's got a way of just digging
and needling.

01:34.877 --> 01:37.923
And he also has
this really punchable face.

01:37.967 --> 01:39.142
It's so punchable.

01:39.186 --> 01:40.404
Uh...

01:40.448 --> 01:41.840
- It's like right in the--
- Yeah.

01:41.884 --> 01:44.321
Jamie, turn off the camera
and destroy the footage.

01:44.365 --> 01:46.193
Yeah. So technically,

01:46.236 --> 01:47.368
we don't own the footage.

01:47.411 --> 01:48.934
It belongs to the network.

01:48.978 --> 01:51.850
- Since when did you become
a corporate stooge, Jamie?

01:51.894 --> 01:53.983
- Tchh.
- You wear that Che Guevara

01:54.026 --> 01:55.202
T-shirt all the time,

01:55.245 --> 01:56.333
and then you say
something like that.

01:56.377 --> 01:57.769
Come on, man.

01:57.813 --> 01:59.641
- The story's breaking
everywhere.

01:59.684 --> 02:02.383
All the news outlets
and social media.

02:02.426 --> 02:04.124
- Oh, boy.
Come on, Sandy.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.126
We gotta deal with this now.

02:06.865 --> 02:09.651
- Randall, look, I know
I shouldn't have responded,

02:09.694 --> 02:12.871
but that kid has been coming
for me since day one.

02:12.915 --> 02:15.439
- I mean, it's natural
to want to defend yourself.

02:15.483 --> 02:17.354
- It is, but doing
something wrong

02:17.398 --> 02:20.444
with the best of intentions
isn't an excuse.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.490
My dad used to do that
all the time,

02:22.533 --> 02:24.796
and it used to drive my mom
and I crazy.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.146
Like this one time
in particular,

02:26.189 --> 02:27.495
when we were living
in Nashville--

02:27.538 --> 02:28.539
- Oh, yeah, you started
to tell me about that.

02:28.583 --> 02:29.671
Yeah.

02:29.714 --> 02:31.020
- You went there to live
with your dad

02:31.063 --> 02:32.630
while he was wrestling
in the Memphis territory.

02:32.674 --> 02:34.632
- Correct.
And he had told my mom

02:34.676 --> 02:36.591
that he had found
a place for us to live,

02:36.634 --> 02:38.070
which he hadn't,

02:38.114 --> 02:39.768
so I was stuck living

02:39.811 --> 02:41.770
with a family friend,
Downtown Bruno.

02:41.813 --> 02:43.467
And my mom didn't know
any of this,

02:43.511 --> 02:45.861
and she was planning to join
us in a few weeks.

02:45.904 --> 02:48.342
And my dad told me
by the time she got there,

02:48.385 --> 02:50.300
he was gonna have
everything taken care of.

02:50.344 --> 02:52.650
- And did you believe him?
- I sure did.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.435
'Cause even though my dad
worked the gimmick

02:54.478 --> 02:56.828
and he was the master of spin,

02:56.872 --> 03:00.963
I was still 15 years old,
and he was still my hero.

03:01.006 --> 03:03.661
<i>My dad wrestled</i>
<i>in Jerry Lawler's show,</i>

03:03.705 --> 03:06.273
<i>which aired live</i>
<i>every Saturday morning.</i>

03:06.316 --> 03:08.753
- And Rocky gives Jeff Jarrett
the business!

03:12.017 --> 03:14.933
- Come on, Double J!
Quit getting punched so much.

03:18.546 --> 03:19.851
<i>- It was the biggest thing</i>
<i>in Memphis.</i>

03:19.895 --> 03:21.549
<i>Beat everything</i>
<i>in the ratings.</i>

03:21.592 --> 03:23.420
<i>"Golden Girls,"</i>
<i>"Who's the Boss?"...</i>

03:23.464 --> 03:24.726
<i>Not "Cheers," though.</i>

03:24.769 --> 03:27.598
<i>- Even "Cheers."</i>
<i>- Even "Cheers"?</i>

03:27.642 --> 03:29.861
Ooh, vicious clothesline!

03:29.905 --> 03:31.863
I think that's all
she wrote, folks.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.343
Get him, Soulman!

03:34.475 --> 03:36.172
- Get up, Double J!
Come on!

03:36.216 --> 03:38.087
...two, three!

03:38.130 --> 03:40.220
- Whoo! Yeah!

03:40.263 --> 03:41.786
Whoo!

03:43.745 --> 03:45.442
- Another win
for Rocky Johnson.

03:45.486 --> 03:47.270
He's having a hell
of a run out here, folks.

03:47.314 --> 03:50.055
Rocky!
Rocky!

03:50.099 --> 03:51.100
Whoo!

03:52.841 --> 03:54.103
Whoo!

03:54.146 --> 03:56.627
<i>- My dad got me work</i>
<i>with the ring crew,</i>

03:56.671 --> 03:59.543
<i>setting up before</i>
<i>and cleaning up after matches.</i>

03:59.587 --> 04:01.066
- Hey, Dad.
Great match today.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.242
Thanks, Dew.

04:02.285 --> 04:03.547
A win against Jeff Jarrett

04:03.591 --> 04:04.548
always plays huge around here.

04:04.592 --> 04:06.158
- That's 'cause I remind
everyone

04:06.202 --> 04:07.247
of their most hated cousin.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.248
I can see that.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.250
- Oh-ho!
- Hey.

04:10.293 --> 04:11.512
Nice match today, brother.

04:11.555 --> 04:13.253
- Thanks, Bruno. You too.
- Oh...

04:13.296 --> 04:14.602
Oh, I liked when you said

04:14.645 --> 04:18.519
Jared was 230 pounds
of cornmeal and sex appeal.

04:18.562 --> 04:19.694
I appreciate that.

04:19.737 --> 04:21.261
Although all credit
goes to Mom.

04:21.304 --> 04:22.697
That's how she used to
describe my dad.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.568
Yeah. Dude, you ready
to get outta here?

04:24.612 --> 04:25.830
- Uh, yeah.
Gimme five minutes.

04:25.874 --> 04:26.918
- All right.
I'll see you later.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.398
Yeah, bro.

04:28.442 --> 04:30.357
I'm hitting the road.
Got a match in Tupelo tonight.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.490
So, uh, here.
Some walking around money.

04:33.534 --> 04:36.319
Call that father-son
trickle-down economics.

04:36.363 --> 04:37.929
Trickle what?

04:37.973 --> 04:39.279
- Trickle-down economics.

04:39.322 --> 04:40.715
It's this financial theory

04:40.758 --> 04:42.586
that's gonna change society,
son.

04:42.630 --> 04:45.328
The basic idea is that people
who make money

04:45.372 --> 04:47.156
make even more money

04:47.199 --> 04:49.637
so that the little guy
has a chance to get ahead.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.203
That doesn't sound right.

04:51.247 --> 04:54.163
- Doesn't matter how it sounds.
It matters that it works.

04:54.206 --> 04:56.165
- Oh. And I told Mom
that I'm gonna call her today.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.036
Great. Give her my love.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.256
And when I get back,
I might get us a place

05:00.300 --> 05:02.650
before she even gets here.
Don't worry about that.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.173
- For sure.
I'm not worried.

05:04.216 --> 05:05.783
I got it covered.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.307
<i>Everything's going great, Mom.</i>

05:07.350 --> 05:08.786
Dad and I are all moved in,

05:08.830 --> 05:10.048
and we can't wait
for you to get here.

05:10.092 --> 05:12.877
- Fantastic.
So happy to hear that, Dewey.

05:12.921 --> 05:15.140
How's school?
You liking your teachers?

05:15.184 --> 05:18.013
- Now, keep in mind
I'm not enrolled in school.

05:18.056 --> 05:19.623
Why not?

05:19.667 --> 05:20.755
- Well, because no one
made me do it.

05:20.798 --> 05:22.757
My mom told my dad to do it.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.150
My dad told me to do it.
Then he forgot.

05:25.194 --> 05:27.370
And if no one's checking on me,
I'm not gonna be like,

05:27.414 --> 05:29.372
"Ooh, ooh, someone
enroll me in school.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.548
Please, someone!"
I'm not doing that.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.246
School's good, yeah.

05:34.290 --> 05:38.468
Today we learned about
trickle-down economics.

05:38.512 --> 05:40.992
- Great.
Hey, is your dad there?

05:41.036 --> 05:43.647
- He's at the gym.
But he sends his love,

05:43.691 --> 05:45.910
and he said for me to tell you
he'll call you tomorrow.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.303
- Hey, Dewey,
how you want your eggs?

05:47.347 --> 05:48.870
You can have 'em any way
you want

05:48.913 --> 05:51.002
- as long as they're scrambled.
- Shh, man!

05:52.917 --> 05:55.224
Who was that?

05:55.267 --> 05:57.226
It's just the exterminator.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.401
<i>Exterminator?</i>

05:58.445 --> 05:59.924
Are there rats
in the apartment?

05:59.968 --> 06:02.492
No, no. Termites.

06:02.536 --> 06:05.016
Termites?

06:05.060 --> 06:06.627
We don't have termites.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.672
They're just spraying to make
sure that we don't get them.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.979
- <i>We know you don't like bugs.</i>
- Yeah, I hate them.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.415
I told you,
if you ever see a bug on me,

06:12.459 --> 06:14.243
don't tell me,
just knock it off.

06:14.286 --> 06:15.636
Because I'll freak out.

06:15.679 --> 06:17.072
- I know, Mom.
<i>- All right.</i>

06:17.115 --> 06:19.466
Well, our car's on a boat
on the way to California.

06:19.509 --> 06:20.858
I'm gonna fly out there

06:20.902 --> 06:22.599
and pick it up and drive it
to Nashville, okay?

06:22.643 --> 06:23.687
So I'll see you two
on Saturday.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.950
- Okay, see you then.
Love you.

06:25.994 --> 06:28.039
- Love you too, honey.
Bye.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.041
ran out of paper plates,

06:30.085 --> 06:32.435
so it's eggs
a la "Road & Track."

06:32.479 --> 06:33.828
Hey, how's moms doing?

06:33.871 --> 06:35.525
- Good.
She gets here next week.

06:35.569 --> 06:38.528
Oh, damn. So soon.

06:38.572 --> 06:40.356
Well, it's been great
having you, roomie.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.923
- She's not here yet.
How about

06:41.966 --> 06:44.882
we skip the toilet eggs
and go have some fun?

06:45.622 --> 06:47.929
- I mean, I reckon I could
throw 'em in the fridge.

06:47.972 --> 06:49.104
- Mm-hmm.

06:51.236 --> 06:52.586
Yeah. What the hell?

06:52.629 --> 06:54.239
Let's tear it up.

06:54.283 --> 06:55.502
<i>Didn't it bother you</i>

06:55.545 --> 06:57.721
not telling your mom
what was really going on?

06:57.765 --> 06:59.462
- It did.
It really did.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.377
But look, Randall,
I didn't wanna worry her.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.988
And I knew my dad was gonna
deliver before she got there.

07:04.032 --> 07:07.209
I mean, he's a showman, right?
So he likes a dramatic finish.

07:07.252 --> 07:09.429
- So in the meantime, you were
just gonna have some fun?

07:09.472 --> 07:10.604
Oh, come on, man.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.910
I was 15 years old
in a brand-new city,

07:12.954 --> 07:16.174
a great city,
practically unsupervised.

07:16.218 --> 07:17.698
I mean, what would you do?

07:17.741 --> 07:19.090
Would've had fun.

07:19.134 --> 07:20.875
Come on. Like what?

07:20.918 --> 07:23.225
- I don't know,
like watch movies--

07:23.268 --> 07:24.531
- Uh-huh. Go out, though?

07:24.574 --> 07:27.098
- Eat candy and stuff
and have a lot of fun.

07:27.142 --> 07:28.273
Sounds fun, man.

07:28.317 --> 07:29.797
- Yeah.
- Wow.

07:32.495 --> 07:32.713
.

07:38.849 --> 07:40.547
She's really good.

07:40.590 --> 07:41.809
Oh, yeah.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.158
Everyone's really good
in Nashville, Dewey.

07:43.201 --> 07:45.508
You got a dream,
this is where you come.

07:45.552 --> 07:46.901
What's your dream?

07:46.944 --> 07:48.468
To not be poor.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.949
That's it, brother.
All right.

07:51.993 --> 07:54.474
Hey, suck it, Bruno!

07:55.910 --> 07:58.390
- You know, I suggest you shut
your pencil neck up

07:58.434 --> 08:01.132
'fore my bodyguard here
whoops your ass.

08:01.176 --> 08:03.221
- What are you do--
- Go with it.

08:06.007 --> 08:07.965
Oh, my God.
Oh, he's tall.

08:08.009 --> 08:08.923
Oh, I know him,
and I didn't even know

08:08.966 --> 08:10.490
he was that tall.
Way tall.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.448
I mean, that's a--he looks
a little bit bigger than you.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.754
Where you going?

08:17.627 --> 08:20.108
You scraped your chair back,
and he almost pissed his pants.

08:20.151 --> 08:22.153
- Whoo!

08:22.197 --> 08:23.894
Oh, boy, I'm about
to get a whole hell

08:23.938 --> 08:26.767
of a lot more mouthy with
your imposing self by my side.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.160
<i>- So Bruno and I</i>
<i>started hanging out</i>

08:29.204 --> 08:30.684
<i>pretty much all the time.</i>

08:30.727 --> 08:32.555
- Hey, you sure
you don't mind driving?

08:32.599 --> 08:34.688
- You kidding?
I love driving.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.907
- Good, 'cause
I love drinking beer.

08:44.654 --> 08:46.526
<i>- While my dad was</i>
<i>on the road, I was on my own</i>

08:46.569 --> 08:49.659
<i>until my mom got there to do</i>
<i>pretty much whatever I wanted.</i>

09:04.456 --> 09:07.068
- Nice of your girlfriend to
let you wear one of her hats.

09:07.111 --> 09:08.765
What do you mean?

09:35.009 --> 09:36.227
Excuse me.

09:36.271 --> 09:37.925
- Oh, I wasn't--
- I just have to say,

09:37.968 --> 09:40.536
you have the voice of an angel.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.191
- Oh, okay.
Thank you.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.019
Sorry if this seems forward,

09:45.062 --> 09:49.240
but, uh, do you wanna go
grab a drink?

09:49.284 --> 09:52.200
I've noticed
you're not married.

09:52.243 --> 09:55.420
- I'm 15.
- Not again!

09:56.247 --> 09:59.076
Why are all
the beautiful men 15?

10:02.297 --> 10:03.864
<i>- And, of course,</i>
<i>my dad came back</i>

10:03.907 --> 10:06.170
<i>to wrestle for Lawler</i>
<i>whenever the king needed him.</i>

10:06.214 --> 10:07.389
All right, Downtown Bruno.

10:07.432 --> 10:08.999
Tell everyone
about this new wrestler

10:09.043 --> 10:10.827
you're managing making
his debut on the show today.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.133
Oh, man.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.438
You talking
about this man right here?

10:13.482 --> 10:15.049
This guy right here
is Crusher Yurkov.

10:15.092 --> 10:17.138
6'4," 400 pounds

10:17.181 --> 10:19.836
of romping, stomping
tattooed destruction.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.534
I found this man in an alleyway
head-butting a dumpster.

10:22.578 --> 10:24.188
And let me tell you something,
Jerry Lawler.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.756
That hunk of metal
got off a lot easier

10:26.800 --> 10:28.802
than Rocky Johnson will.

10:28.845 --> 10:32.414
- Hey, speak of the devil.
Rocky Johnson's here.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.853
Downtown Bruno, you weasel.

10:36.897 --> 10:38.812
I'll whoop your ass

10:38.855 --> 10:41.249
and then whoop the beef
out this meatball sub

10:41.292 --> 10:42.424
that just rolled in here.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.426
You don't compare me to food.

10:44.469 --> 10:46.167
- They're not even
waiting for the ring.

10:46.210 --> 10:47.559
- These two wanna kill
each other!

10:47.603 --> 10:49.257
- Are you crazy?
- Wait for the ring!

10:49.300 --> 10:50.954
- Oh, my God!
<i>- So yeah, I'd say</i>

10:50.998 --> 10:53.391
<i>my dad and I were both</i>
<i>killing it out there.</i>

10:53.435 --> 10:54.915
It must have hurt.

10:54.958 --> 10:55.959
I don't think it hurts

10:56.003 --> 10:57.265
more than any other place.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.701
- A skull tattoo?
No way!

10:58.745 --> 11:00.921
- That hurts way more than--
- Hey.

11:00.964 --> 11:03.924
Rocky?
Crusher. Crusher Yurkov.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.274
We met earlier
when I tried to strangle you.

11:06.317 --> 11:08.406
- I remember you, Crusher.
- Oh, good, good.

11:08.450 --> 11:09.886
Hey, sorry
for the interruption.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.279
I just wanted to say

11:11.322 --> 11:12.846
it was a real honor
to wrestle you today.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.891
Oh, wow. Thank you.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.719
Hey, this is my son, Dwayne.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.199
Nice to meet you.

11:18.242 --> 11:19.461
Me and my dad were actually
just talking about you.

11:19.504 --> 11:21.942
- Yes.
- Did your skull tattoo hurt?

11:21.985 --> 11:23.987
Terribly.

11:24.031 --> 11:27.512
Hey, I'm actually a huge fan
of you and Tony Atlas.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.601
"Soul Patrol" nerd,
right here.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.473
- Hey, I appreciate
that, brother.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.475
- Watching Tony in
"WrestleMania 2"...

11:33.518 --> 11:34.824
it just wasn't
the same without you.

11:34.868 --> 11:36.652
You know,
I always felt like you did 99%

11:36.696 --> 11:38.785
of the real wrestling
in the ring.

11:38.828 --> 11:39.916
You see this, Dewey?

11:39.960 --> 11:41.657
We got ourselves
a student of the game.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.790
- Yes, sir.
Vince McMahon sent me down here

11:43.833 --> 11:46.575
to develop my skills,
and maybe hopefully, one day,

11:46.618 --> 11:48.272
he'll call me up to the WWF.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.492
- WWF? Nice.
- Yeah.

11:50.535 --> 11:51.972
- You know, I always thought
you had

11:52.015 --> 11:53.669
a lot more left to do there.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.324
You know, too bad about
that whole Saudi Arabia thing,

11:56.367 --> 11:57.542
you know, such freaky timing.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.240
Hey, I saw an opportunity

11:59.283 --> 12:01.938
to wrestle for another
promoter, and I took it.

12:01.982 --> 12:03.113
There's no law against trying

12:03.157 --> 12:04.506
to make some more money
for your family.

12:04.549 --> 12:07.335
- No, of course, I-I
just meant it was bad luck--

12:07.378 --> 12:08.728
Man, I don't need luck.

12:08.771 --> 12:11.426
- We make our own luck.
- I-I mean no disrespect.

12:11.469 --> 12:13.994
- That's fine.
Don't go spreading rumors.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.430
Hey, brothers.

12:15.473 --> 12:16.823
We'll have to hitch
a ride to Nashville.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.303
Looks like one of the
crazy fans slashed my tires.

12:19.347 --> 12:21.349
- Damn!
Congrats, Bruno.

12:21.392 --> 12:23.394
You're getting
some serious heat.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.788
- I know.
People hate me so much.

12:25.832 --> 12:26.702
Isn't it great?

12:26.746 --> 12:28.051
Hey, you can't handle my heat,

12:28.095 --> 12:30.184
stay outta my bathroom kitchen.

12:30.227 --> 12:32.142
Hey, there.

12:37.974 --> 12:40.020
There are my guys!

12:42.936 --> 12:44.328
- Mom
- Hey!

12:46.853 --> 12:47.027
.

12:47.070 --> 12:49.333
- My goodness.
It's so great to see you.

12:49.377 --> 12:50.900
- I've missed you.
- Oh, we missed you too, baby.

12:50.944 --> 12:52.467
- I didn't think you were
getting in until Saturday.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.512
- It is Saturday!
That's why I came straight here

12:54.556 --> 12:57.864
because I know you always shoot
Jerry's shows on Saturday.

12:57.907 --> 13:00.257
- Yes, we do.
- Hi, Bruno.

13:00.301 --> 13:03.652
- Hey, Ata.
Uh, this is Crusher.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.785
Yeah, I just started managing
him a couple weeks ago.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.177
Hello, Crusher.

13:07.221 --> 13:08.352
Ma'am.

13:08.396 --> 13:09.963
Okay. Well, let's go.

13:10.006 --> 13:12.835
Can't wait to see
our apartment.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.011
- Great.
Let's go see the apartment.

13:15.055 --> 13:17.448
But you've been driving
for a long time, babe.

13:17.492 --> 13:18.885
I'll take your car.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.712
Dewey, you can ride with Bruno
and y'all follow us.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.366
Yeah, that's a good idea.

13:22.410 --> 13:26.457
The car is loaded with boxes
and souvenirs and fireworks.

13:26.501 --> 13:29.417
The open road was basically
a 2,000-mile strip mall.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.462
Yeah.

13:31.506 --> 13:32.855
It's just that...

13:32.899 --> 13:35.249
my tire slash, remember?

13:35.292 --> 13:36.946
Um...

13:38.426 --> 13:39.906
Thanks for the ride.

13:39.949 --> 13:42.778
- Yeah, no problem.
It's a rental.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.871
So, uh, where are we going?

13:48.915 --> 13:50.394
I don't know.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.876
Bruno?

13:53.920 --> 13:56.618
No idea, brother.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.054
Maybe he got us a place.

13:58.098 --> 13:59.795
Maybe he's just taking us there
to surprise us.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.014
Maybe!

14:02.667 --> 14:04.974
Yeah, yeah, maybe.

14:06.149 --> 14:08.978
Hey, did I ever tell you
your dad was the one

14:09.022 --> 14:11.546
who encouraged me to get
into the wrestling business?

14:11.589 --> 14:13.330
He must have seen something
in a short, skinny white kid

14:13.374 --> 14:15.942
who could talk circles
around a preacher.

14:15.985 --> 14:18.466
And believe me,
he was the first.

14:18.509 --> 14:19.989
He said to me,
"You know what, Bruno?

14:20.033 --> 14:21.382
I'm gonna call
Jerry Lawler for you."

14:21.425 --> 14:25.299
And he did.
Changed my life forever.

14:26.561 --> 14:28.302
Your dad is a good man.

14:33.350 --> 14:34.569
Ooh.

14:34.612 --> 14:37.050
That's not good.

14:37.093 --> 14:38.921
- I don't think
he got the place.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.531
- Nope.
Maybe not.

14:42.794 --> 14:44.057
Maybe not.

14:46.233 --> 14:49.323
- Babe, baby.
Come on.

14:49.366 --> 14:52.500
- Where the hell were we going?
Where were you even driving to?

14:52.543 --> 14:54.328
Long John Silver's!

14:54.371 --> 14:56.112
I was gonna tell you on the way
I didn't get an apartment

14:56.156 --> 14:57.548
then smooth it over
with some fish.

14:57.592 --> 14:59.942
- Some fi--why didn't you
just get an apartment?

14:59.986 --> 15:01.465
You had one job!

15:01.509 --> 15:02.989
- Hey, I happened to have
a wrestling job,

15:03.032 --> 15:05.817
a very real job that takes me
all over this territory

15:05.861 --> 15:07.297
to make money for this family.

15:07.341 --> 15:08.385
- You told me
he had an apartment.

15:08.429 --> 15:10.126
You said the exterminator
was there!

15:10.170 --> 15:11.867
- He said he was gonna get
a place before you got here.

15:11.911 --> 15:12.868
- So where have you two
been living?

15:12.912 --> 15:14.348
I'm here and there, you know,

15:14.391 --> 15:15.827
in and out of town,
just bouncing around, really.

15:15.871 --> 15:16.959
Bouncing around?

15:17.003 --> 15:18.134
- And I've been staying
with Bruno.

15:18.178 --> 15:20.267
- Heyo.
- With Bruno?

15:20.310 --> 15:21.398
If you don't mind, gentlemen,

15:21.442 --> 15:22.573
I'm just gonna interject
real quick.

15:22.617 --> 15:23.661
I just wanna say, you know,

15:23.705 --> 15:25.272
we have been very responsible.

15:25.315 --> 15:26.926
All right?
No shenanigans.

15:26.969 --> 15:28.666
And even when I've only had
a few beers...

15:28.710 --> 15:29.841
- Bruno.
- Dewey drives us home

15:29.885 --> 15:31.321
- super safe.
- You're driving?

15:31.365 --> 15:32.844
- Barely.
- Mostly, he's just

15:32.888 --> 15:34.324
- my bodyguard.
- What?

15:34.368 --> 15:35.978
- Yeah. I mean, only
at the rougher bars, of course.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.154
- Bruno!
- I'm gonna go move the Nissan.

15:38.198 --> 15:41.070
Butt's a little too close
to the road.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.246
- Wait, so who's been
taking you to school?

15:43.290 --> 15:44.987
- Yeah, Dewey.
How is school?

15:45.031 --> 15:46.858
- It's summer.
- It's October.

15:46.902 --> 15:48.338
Are you not in school?

15:48.382 --> 15:50.601
- I couldn't enroll myself.
An adult needs to take me.

15:50.645 --> 15:51.994
I didn't know that.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.953
Bruno, why didn't you
enroll him?

15:53.996 --> 15:55.171
- Well, shoot, brother.
I don't know.

15:55.215 --> 15:56.694
I guess that's on me.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.870
- I can't believe you've both
been lying to me.

15:58.914 --> 16:01.351
- Dad said he had a plan.
- Everyone just take a breath.

16:01.395 --> 16:03.223
- He didn't have a plan, Dewey!
- Babe, I did have a plan.

16:03.266 --> 16:06.008
<i>- That was a tough time</i>
<i>for all of us,</i>

16:06.052 --> 16:07.357
but especially for my mom.

16:07.401 --> 16:09.359
We had so much stuff
going on back then.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.709
And I've spoken a little bit
about this publicly,

16:11.753 --> 16:15.017
but this story is about my dad
and having good intentions,

16:15.061 --> 16:16.497
but still making mistakes.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.194
- Well, I can understand
why you wanted to believe

16:18.238 --> 16:19.587
what he was telling you,
though.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.415
- Yeah, I mean, this person
who's been your hero

16:21.458 --> 16:22.807
your entire life,

16:22.851 --> 16:24.505
and it's hard to wrap your head
around the idea

16:24.548 --> 16:26.246
that maybe he's not the person
who you think he is.

16:26.289 --> 16:27.725
So what happened after that?

16:27.769 --> 16:30.206
- Well, first,
my mom enrolled me in school,

16:30.250 --> 16:32.469
and then she found us
an apartment to live in.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.740
Hey, this is nice.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.568
It will be, yeah.

16:44.612 --> 16:46.962
- What do you say we break in

16:47.006 --> 16:49.399
cheese, burgers.

16:49.443 --> 16:51.836
- It'll just be me and Dewey
for dinner tonight, Rocky.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.578
It'll just be me and Dewey
for dinner for a while here.

16:54.622 --> 16:55.884
Oh, come on, baby.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.407
I know
you're still upset with me--

16:57.451 --> 16:58.930
- You can stay with Bruno
whenever you're...

16:58.974 --> 17:00.802
"bouncing through town."

17:00.845 --> 17:02.238
If that's what you want.

17:02.282 --> 17:04.066
None of this is what I want,

17:04.110 --> 17:05.502
but it's what it is.

17:19.125 --> 17:19.516
.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.128
- Thanks for the ride, Mom.
- Of course.

17:22.171 --> 17:24.565
- You sure you don't wanna
come in, say hi to everyone?

17:24.608 --> 17:27.002
- I'm sure.
I'll see you at home.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.659
<i>- I understood</i>
<i>how my mom felt.</i>

17:31.702 --> 17:33.487
<i>My dad had let us both down.</i>

17:33.530 --> 17:36.098
Ooh! Another hit!

17:36.142 --> 17:37.839
And Crusher Yurkov
is holding his own

17:37.882 --> 17:39.623
against
the veteran Rocky Johnson!

17:39.667 --> 17:42.496
Looks like Rocky's setting him
up for a drop kick.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.499
But Crusher as other ideas.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.547
Oh, impressive athletic ability
for a man that size.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.941
The champ looks stunned.
He's reelin', folks.

17:52.984 --> 17:55.465
The big man's got him
right where he wants him.

17:59.904 --> 18:01.428
Hey, son, how you doing?

18:01.471 --> 18:02.733
Fine.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.779
Hey, how's your mom?

18:04.822 --> 18:06.476
- That's right, baby!
Choke him out!

18:06.520 --> 18:08.435
- Hey, miss you, roomie.
How's Moms doing?

18:08.478 --> 18:09.610
- Hey, that's what
I just asked.

18:09.653 --> 18:10.959
She's doing fine.

18:11.002 --> 18:12.787
- Look, you know
your mom and me.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.180
We go through our ups
and downs,

18:14.223 --> 18:16.138
- but we always see it through.
- Start the count.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.531
- I'll give you
a ride home today, okay?

18:19.489 --> 18:21.578
Yeah, I don't know.

18:21.622 --> 18:23.014
It's only been a week.
She's still pretty upset.

18:23.058 --> 18:24.668
- What the hell's
going on over here?

18:24.712 --> 18:26.714
Everyone okay?
Nobody's got the clap, right?

18:26.757 --> 18:29.108
- The clap?
- Yeah. It's going around.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.632
Everyone be careful.
Take care of your junk.

18:32.502 --> 18:35.114
- Look, it's just a ride.
I won't come in, I promise.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.724
Yeah, okay.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.247
- All right,
let's get back to work.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.989
- Thank you, son.
Agh!

18:43.513 --> 18:45.776
These two are crazy!

18:48.475 --> 18:51.086
So, how's school?

18:51.130 --> 18:53.088
- Dad...
- What?

18:53.132 --> 18:54.785
I just want to talk.

18:54.829 --> 18:56.439
What's there to talk about?

18:56.483 --> 18:58.485
I believed you when you said
you were taking care of things,

18:58.528 --> 19:01.531
and it all blew up in my face?

19:01.575 --> 19:04.317
- You're right to be upset,
okay?

19:04.360 --> 19:06.667
I'm upset too.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.016
I know I kept you in the dark

19:08.059 --> 19:10.888
about all this,
but I do have a plan.

19:10.932 --> 19:13.761
It just...didn't come together
in time.

19:20.507 --> 19:22.639
Where are we going?

19:22.683 --> 19:25.164
- To show you the reason
I didn't get us a place.

19:25.207 --> 19:29.211
It's because couldn't get us
a place like this.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.866
Man, I wanted us
to live somewhere good,

19:31.909 --> 19:35.261
like back when I was WWF champ.
Better, even.

19:35.304 --> 19:37.785
- Dad, we don't need
a place like this.

19:37.828 --> 19:41.702
- I'm gonna get us a place
like this, promise.

19:41.745 --> 19:44.879
I'll make it happen.

19:44.922 --> 19:48.970
I had us on top once before.
I'll get us there again.

19:53.757 --> 19:55.368
<i>And did you believe him?</i>

19:55.411 --> 19:58.893
- I believed that that was
genuinely what he wanted to do.

19:58.936 --> 20:00.590
- Best intentions.
- Exactly.

20:00.634 --> 20:03.637
But my dad's choices really put
my mom and I in a tough spot.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.379
And even though we came to an
understanding in that car ride,

20:06.422 --> 20:09.033
that was just the beginning
of my journey with my dad.

20:09.077 --> 20:11.993
And things would get even
more complicated down the road.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.516
- Hmm.
- All right.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.083
So we drafted up

20:15.126 --> 20:16.911
a media strategy
to deal with this.

20:16.954 --> 20:18.086
Wrote up a press release,

20:18.129 --> 20:19.609
booked you
on the Sunday show circuit.

20:19.653 --> 20:21.045
But then we were like,

20:21.089 --> 20:22.786
"Why the hell
are we indulging this jerk?"

20:22.830 --> 20:24.614
- Yeah, why would we
amplify him

20:24.658 --> 20:26.268
and give him
an even larger platform?

20:26.312 --> 20:27.791
So instead, we think

20:27.835 --> 20:29.663
we should destroy him
from the shadows.

20:29.706 --> 20:31.534
- Whoa.
- I'll get our guys started

20:31.578 --> 20:33.449
on digging up dirt on Dr. Echo.

20:33.493 --> 20:38.106
- Guys, I appreciate this,
but we're not gonna do that.

20:38.149 --> 20:39.760
After talking
with Randall here,

20:39.803 --> 20:41.283
I realized
that making a mistake

20:41.327 --> 20:43.938
with the best of intentions
is one thing,

20:43.981 --> 20:46.332
but making a mistake
with the worst...

20:46.375 --> 20:47.811
it's just not me.

20:49.639 --> 20:52.120
Yeah, our chat
got pretty deep.

20:53.556 --> 20:55.689
Hey, uh, Jamie, you get that?

20:55.732 --> 20:57.081
I did, because luckily,

20:57.125 --> 20:59.127
I didn't destroy
the digital card.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.955
- We get it, Jamie.
You're a hero.

21:00.998 --> 21:04.785
All hail Jamie,
doer of her job.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.265
- You know,
but you guys are right.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.136
We shouldn't give him
a larger platform,

21:08.179 --> 21:10.399
and the 24-hour news cycle
moves fast,

21:10.443 --> 21:12.096
and tomorrow, they'll be on
to the next thing.

21:12.140 --> 21:15.230
So let's just ignore it
and let it die.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.797
Okay, sure.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.799
I just need
to make a call real quick.

21:18.842 --> 21:20.409
- You already called your guys,
didn't you?

21:20.453 --> 21:22.324
I did.
