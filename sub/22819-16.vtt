WEBVTT

00:07.425 --> 00:12.263
<i>More, give me more Give me more</i>

00:13.055 --> 00:17.435
<i>If I had a heart
I could love you</i>

00:18.728 --> 00:22.356
<i>If I had a voice I would sing</i>

00:24.900 --> 00:28.988
<i>After the night When I wake up</i>

00:29.655 --> 00:34.619
<i>I'll see What tomorrow brings</i>

00:41.334 --> 00:45.254
<i>If I had a voice I would sing</i>

01:18.954 --> 01:19.997
Well?

01:20.623 --> 01:21.666
No one has seen her.

01:24.377 --> 01:26.671
If she's still alive,
she has vanished.

01:30.174 --> 01:32.301
I swore upon my life and my god,

01:32.385 --> 01:34.553
if with your help
we defeated our enemies,

01:35.096 --> 01:36.698
that I would honor
the pledges made to you

01:36.722 --> 01:39.225
by my grandfather, King Ecbert.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.941
Here is the treaty giving you,
by our royal consent,

01:47.024 --> 01:48.442
achelands that constitute

01:48.526 --> 01:50.319
the ancient kingdom
of East Anglia.

01:52.988 --> 01:55.199
Theselands
I grant you in perpetuity,

01:55.658 --> 01:57.827
to settle and to farm
as you see fit.

01:59.078 --> 02:00.955
Now, there's not
a great population there,

02:01.664 --> 02:03.708
but still, there are
settlements and farms.

02:04.542 --> 02:05.543
Some have moved away,

02:05.626 --> 02:07.169
but others have
chosen to remain.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.380
I suggest you treat them well.

02:09.839 --> 02:11.674
They are not so ill-disposed
towards you,

02:11.757 --> 02:14.260
but they will be wary
and apprehensive.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.930
The last time this happened...

02:18.806 --> 02:21.392
All I can say is that
this time will be different.

02:22.143 --> 02:23.453
I will leave some
of my bodyguards

02:23.477 --> 02:24.979
as a gesture of my support,

02:25.062 --> 02:26.605
and I will use
my authority as King

02:26.689 --> 02:27.857
to protect your rights.

02:28.774 --> 02:30.317
You have no reason
to fear otherwise.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.578
Here I do affix the royal seal.

02:41.871 --> 02:42.913
And so it is done.

02:47.460 --> 02:50.171
And now I welcome you, formally,

02:51.672 --> 02:53.424
as allies and as friends.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.774
That is not the end
of our business today.

03:14.236 --> 03:16.989
Guards, arrest the traitors.

03:18.574 --> 03:20.618
No!
You can't do this!

03:20.868 --> 03:21.869
Take your hands off me!

03:21.952 --> 03:22.953
Unhand me!
No!

03:24.121 --> 03:25.122
No, Lord! I'm innocent!

03:25.664 --> 03:28.250
You will soon have cause to regret
these actions, Lord Alfred!

03:28.584 --> 03:29.710
That I promise you!

03:31.796 --> 03:33.839
I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!

04:03.953 --> 04:09.250
So, King Harald,
you return defeated,

04:09.625 --> 04:12.253
having been made a fool
of by Bjorn Ironside,

04:13.128 --> 04:16.882
and with no sign of Jarl
Olavsson, our leader.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.135
Jarl Olavsson
died well in battle,

04:24.431 --> 04:28.561
and is certainly
now in Valhalla.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.479
What is that to us?

04:32.565 --> 04:34.149
You must believe
in your leaders.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.487
They can suffer
reversals, defeats,

04:39.530 --> 04:43.200
but you must
give them a chance to prove

04:43.284 --> 04:44.764
just why they rose
in the first place.

04:47.079 --> 04:50.541
I don't believe
in giving second chances.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.003
Not to fools and failures.

05:03.012 --> 05:07.308
Exactly my words when I
was younger, but, uh...

05:10.394 --> 05:13.647
You live and you learn.

05:40.215 --> 05:44.720
Friends, I didn't have
the chance to present to you

05:45.304 --> 05:49.391
Magnus, son of Ragnar Lothbrok.

05:49.642 --> 05:51.310
Hail Ragnar!

05:51.393 --> 05:54.438
With him beside us,
we can achieve great things.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.360
This city of York
will be a great city!

06:00.986 --> 06:05.032
The center of an empire!
Our empire!

06:06.492 --> 06:08.953
That will stretch
from here to Kattegat,

06:09.453 --> 06:12.414
from Ireland to Frankia,

06:13.290 --> 06:16.377
from Scotland
to the steppes of Rus!

06:16.961 --> 06:18.629
Yeah!

06:31.058 --> 06:32.059
Sit.

06:38.357 --> 06:40.734
You killed Heahmund,

06:40.818 --> 06:42.736
one of the greatest
of all Saxon warriors.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.738
He was already badly wounded.

06:45.322 --> 06:46.824
I just finished him off.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.078
Why are you fighting
for King Harald?

06:51.620 --> 06:54.790
I was at York with my
husband, Jarl Olavsson.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.667
We agreed to join
the King's army.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.492
And where is your husband now?

06:58.836 --> 07:00.170
He was killed in the battle.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.090
It's a pity.
He was a good husband.

07:04.341 --> 07:05.384
A good man.

07:06.719 --> 07:08.012
I lost my mother in the battle.

07:09.430 --> 07:12.224
Your mother? Who are you?

07:13.934 --> 07:16.478
Bjorn. Bjorn Ironside.

07:17.730 --> 07:18.814
You're famous.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.317
I suppose that means
you can do what you want.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.570
Ask people anything you want.

07:27.031 --> 07:28.032
What is your name?

07:28.365 --> 07:29.366
Gunnhild.

07:29.908 --> 07:30.909
Gunnhild.

07:32.536 --> 07:33.871
I would like to know you better.

07:34.872 --> 07:36.331
What am I supposed to say?

07:37.374 --> 07:41.462
You see how it is with me.
I am bound. Prisoner.

07:42.421 --> 07:43.505
My husband is dead.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.051
Am I supposed
to refuse your advances?

07:48.343 --> 07:49.970
I could take advantage of you.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.641
But I don't want to.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.311
You and I, we are equals.

07:59.521 --> 08:02.816
I will cut your ropes
if you answer me a question.

08:03.609 --> 08:04.610
Yes?

08:05.861 --> 08:07.404
After Heahmund died,

08:07.488 --> 08:09.573
my mother was wounded
and she vanished.

08:10.866 --> 08:12.093
I need to know
if you were witness

08:12.117 --> 08:14.328
to anything that could
give me answers.

08:14.787 --> 08:16.139
I need to know
if her disappearance

08:16.163 --> 08:17.414
was of her own making

08:18.373 --> 08:19.500
or against her will.

08:21.043 --> 08:22.294
I cannot help you.

08:23.504 --> 08:24.630
I saw nothing.

08:38.602 --> 08:41.688
You're a free woman.
You can do anything you like.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.655
What was that for?

08:50.781 --> 08:52.699
I was just
exercising my freedom.

08:55.452 --> 08:56.745
Perhaps we shall meet again.

08:57.704 --> 08:58.747
Who knows?

08:59.998 --> 09:00.999
You can leave now.

09:15.848 --> 09:17.015
What happened to her?

09:20.477 --> 09:22.104
How do people just disappear?

09:22.938 --> 09:23.981
Well, you know how.

09:24.523 --> 09:25.983
Didn't our father
just disappear?

09:28.235 --> 09:29.695
Lagertha isn't like that.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.073
She doesn'tjust run away.

09:33.157 --> 09:34.575
And in the middle of a battle?

09:35.826 --> 09:37.202
And how did she
even manage that?

09:37.327 --> 09:38.847
It was like she was
sucked into thin air.

09:38.871 --> 09:40.289
I know her...
No. you don't!

09:41.039 --> 09:42.166
You know nothing.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.209
Lagertha killed your mother.

09:44.293 --> 09:46.628
As far as you're concerned,
you'd rather she be dead.

09:47.462 --> 09:48.881
Why am I even talking to you?

09:50.507 --> 09:51.758
I do know Lagertha.

09:54.094 --> 09:59.016
I loved her and I trusted her
and she loved and trusted me.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.662
She wouldn't have
just disappeared,

10:02.686 --> 10:04.396
not unless there was a reason.

10:06.023 --> 10:07.316
What does that even mean?

10:07.900 --> 10:09.776
Perhaps she had come
to the end of reason.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.326
He saved my life.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.287
He was implicated.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.541
You have... I've already
decided to forgive him.

10:29.546 --> 10:30.797
Have you told him that?

10:37.512 --> 10:38.513
Alfred...

10:40.766 --> 10:43.352
He has to talk about it.

10:44.019 --> 10:46.480
He has to be honest.

10:47.231 --> 10:49.274
Then, then you can forgive him.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.026
For God's sake!

10:51.944 --> 10:54.071
I understand. I do.

10:57.491 --> 11:00.118
But if you won't talk to him,

11:00.869 --> 11:03.413
please give me
your permission to do so.

11:04.248 --> 11:07.709
Please. I need to know why,

11:10.754 --> 11:12.881
so perhaps I can forgive him.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.274
Treacherous scum.

11:35.487 --> 11:36.488
Treason.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.536
Death to the King!

11:51.420 --> 11:52.462
Long live the King!

12:16.778 --> 12:17.779
Ugh.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.162
Food!

12:33.754 --> 12:34.755
Floki!

12:35.881 --> 12:36.923
What was that?

12:37.340 --> 12:38.341
Floki!

12:40.385 --> 12:41.386
Wait here.

12:43.055 --> 12:44.097
Floki!

12:58.403 --> 12:59.446
AUDzHagu

13:06.286 --> 13:07.287
Come inside.

13:10.248 --> 13:11.625
You have bad frostbite.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.586
You will lose at least
one of your fingers.

13:16.213 --> 13:18.381
Why did you travel
all this way in such weather?

13:20.717 --> 13:22.010
I had no choice.

13:22.761 --> 13:23.762
Why?

13:24.096 --> 13:25.514
Everyone is dying.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.602
What do you mean, Helgi?
Who is dying?

13:33.647 --> 13:36.858
Soon after we left here,
my father fell ill.

13:38.902 --> 13:41.196
We went a long way.
We built a house.

13:42.197 --> 13:45.158
But there is so little food
and everyone is sick.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.579
I think Eyvind is dying.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.584
And my sister Jorunn
was very sick when I left.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.879
And we've already had
to bury two of the...

13:58.463 --> 14:00.132
Two or three of the young ones.

14:00.799 --> 14:03.718
Shh. Don't talk anymore.

14:03.885 --> 14:06.596
I beg you. Please help us.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.723
Go and save my family.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.269
I know we don't deserve
to be saved but please, Floki.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.109
Try and save them
before it's too late.

14:20.944 --> 14:21.987
Please!

14:26.741 --> 14:31.204
Think of Mjolnir, Thor's
hammer, for strength.

14:37.711 --> 14:38.879
<i>(Mam SOBS)</i>

14:48.346 --> 14:49.431
Why do you want to see me?

14:54.186 --> 14:55.562
You know why.

14:56.188 --> 14:58.648
If I knew, then I would not ask.

15:01.026 --> 15:06.406
All your friends
are arrested, Aethelred.

15:07.824 --> 15:12.120
Lord Cyneheard
confessed everything.

15:13.788 --> 15:14.789
Very well.

15:16.124 --> 15:17.524
It's true.
I was approached by them.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.213
I was still angry
that I had been forced,

15:21.296 --> 15:22.797
so it seemed,
to renounce the crown

15:22.881 --> 15:24.507
that I thought
was mine by right.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.928
They persuaded me that Alfred
had no support as King,

15:28.762 --> 15:30.430
that he'd be overthrown,
in any case.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.434
But that, if I agreed
to replace him,

15:35.143 --> 15:36.811
the coup would be bloodless.

15:38.396 --> 15:42.734
And you agreed
to go along with them?

15:43.360 --> 15:44.420
They wanted to stage the coup

15:44.444 --> 15:45.904
just before we left for battle.

15:46.571 --> 15:49.115
They wanted me to give the signal.
I refused.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.202
Then you were involved.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.871
I told you, I refused.

15:59.251 --> 16:00.919
I regret ever having
listened to them.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.213
I was foolish and too proud.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.340
I tried to make amends
on the battlefield.

16:05.423 --> 16:08.635
I would have gladly lost my own
life to save my brother's.

16:10.220 --> 16:13.431
I will never,
ever betray him again.

16:18.228 --> 16:19.938
Go and find your mother, boy!

16:21.481 --> 16:25.151
Knives to grind! Bring your knives here!
Bring your knives!

16:47.382 --> 16:48.383
Is this a god?

16:49.217 --> 16:50.260
No god.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.971
That is the Buddha.

16:55.223 --> 16:56.433
And who is the Buddha?

17:08.236 --> 17:09.237
Thank you.

17:14.242 --> 17:19.039
Hvitserk, I have just received
some very interesting news.

17:20.707 --> 17:24.294
It seems King Harald
was defeated in Wessex

17:24.377 --> 17:26.129
by the new King, Alfred.

17:27.964 --> 17:32.218
But with the help of
Lagertha, Bjorn and Ubbe.

17:32.635 --> 17:35.013
Then you knew all along that
you didn't sacrifice Lagertha.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.310
Did Harald survive the battle?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.270
Yes, he retreated to York.

17:45.106 --> 17:48.276
It seems to me that now it is
time for us to return to England.

17:49.152 --> 17:52.030
Harald has learned his lesson.
He cannot win without me.

17:53.656 --> 17:54.657
What is that?

17:59.245 --> 18:01.581
When our father
took me to England,

18:01.664 --> 18:03.541
and was imprisoned
by King Ecbert,

18:05.001 --> 18:07.128
I played chess
with Prince Alfred.

18:10.215 --> 18:12.258
And now I would like
to play chess with him again.

18:13.802 --> 18:16.971
Only this time,
on the battlefield.

19:06.521 --> 19:07.522
That's the King!

19:07.605 --> 19:08.606
Yeah.

19:10.233 --> 19:12.235
The King and the men.
They're here.

19:15.113 --> 19:17.365
Here is the boundary
of your legal possession.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.052
Beyond this point,
and right to the sea,

19:20.076 --> 19:21.536
is the kingdom of East Anglia.

19:22.245 --> 19:25.415
It was ever in my gift,
so I have gifted it to you.

19:30.962 --> 19:33.548
Look, Bjorn.
Look at this treasure.

20:10.251 --> 20:12.045
They betrayed every principle,

20:13.713 --> 20:16.716
every dream,
every hope of our settlement.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.427
But they are still my family.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.096
And they need help,
and you can help them.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.683
If we delay anymore,
all of them will be dead.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.688
What are you thinking?

20:31.606 --> 20:35.151
I was thinking that at last our
settlement was beginning to work.

20:36.611 --> 20:37.904
There was no more bad blood.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.492
No need for revenge or killing.

20:44.369 --> 20:46.204
And now you want to bring
these people back.

20:48.331 --> 20:50.208
These people
that started the chain.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.170
Who didn't want to listen to me.

20:56.172 --> 20:58.800
Floki, I understand.

21:00.260 --> 21:02.637
I can see your worries,
but it's different now.

21:04.555 --> 21:06.349
My father has learned a lesson.

21:07.725 --> 21:09.894
He is filled with remorse.

21:11.854 --> 21:12.981
And you believe him?

21:13.481 --> 21:14.774
He has changed, Floki.

21:16.359 --> 21:17.652
He has changed.

21:18.987 --> 21:20.154
It can happen.

21:21.322 --> 21:23.616
Isn't that what you said
would happen here, Floki?

21:25.159 --> 21:26.953
That we would live differently.

21:27.787 --> 21:28.997
That we would change.

21:59.527 --> 22:00.862
- Welcome, sire.
- Hmm.

22:03.614 --> 22:04.615
Welcome.

22:07.577 --> 22:08.995
I cannot go inside.

22:09.746 --> 22:11.456
No.NorL

22:12.081 --> 22:13.416
They worship 3 false god.

22:21.799 --> 22:23.051
<i>Do you want to talk?</i>

22:28.890 --> 22:30.350
I have lost my father.

22:32.560 --> 22:33.853
And now my mother.

22:36.731 --> 22:38.566
And yet here
is my father's dream.

22:40.485 --> 22:41.527
Right here.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.823
Everything he ever
wanted for us.

22:49.702 --> 22:50.828
How strange.

23:14.227 --> 23:15.228
It's all right.

23:16.312 --> 23:17.855
Everything will be all right.

23:18.981 --> 23:19.982
Everything.

23:39.210 --> 23:40.628
Make way!
Clear the square!

23:40.962 --> 23:42.463
- Clear the way!
- Stand aside!

23:42.547 --> 23:43.548
Out of the way!

23:46.134 --> 23:47.135
My Lady.

23:51.389 --> 23:52.390
It's the King.

23:54.892 --> 23:56.227
Go and fetch the physicians.

23:56.727 --> 23:57.728
Yes, My Lady.

23:58.729 --> 24:00.189
All of you, leave.

24:00.648 --> 24:01.858
- Yes, My Lady.
- My Lady.

24:05.403 --> 24:07.947
Elsewith,
this is not the first time

24:08.030 --> 24:09.258
Alfred has been
struck down like this.

24:09.282 --> 24:10.324
It's happened before.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.081
What can we do?

24:21.919 --> 24:25.673
Well, there is very little
we can do.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.049
I wish there were.

24:27.925 --> 24:30.845
At least I can find the
ingredients for some hot salves.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.144
Are you...

24:38.811 --> 24:39.812
Yes.

24:41.022 --> 24:42.231
I think I'm With Child.

24:47.695 --> 24:50.656
Elsewith, you must not
lose this child.

24:51.532 --> 24:53.784
So much depends
upon this unborn child.

24:54.535 --> 24:56.120
Perhaps the future of England.

25:09.217 --> 25:10.218
My poor brother.

25:14.805 --> 25:15.848
He has to live.

25:16.599 --> 25:17.808
Nothing else matters.

25:22.939 --> 25:25.441
"Everything is
One, and only the One is.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.446
"Life is a bridge,
build no house upon it.

25:31.197 --> 25:33.449
"It's a river,
but don't cling to its banks.

25:35.159 --> 25:36.494
"You're on a journey."

25:38.371 --> 25:40.748
This weird old man
told you all that?

25:41.666 --> 25:43.668
And many other things
I've already forgotten.

25:44.252 --> 25:45.586
Perhaps it's all a joke.

25:46.587 --> 25:47.964
Floki would have said so.

25:48.798 --> 25:51.634
What does it mean?
Ajourney to where?

25:54.262 --> 25:56.055
He told me
I can go talk to him again.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.558
That he would enlighten me.

26:00.142 --> 26:01.227
But for now,

26:03.688 --> 26:04.855
let's just have sex.

26:29.880 --> 26:30.965
Thank you.

26:36.429 --> 26:40.266
That was an emissary
from King Olaf the Stout.

26:43.394 --> 26:47.148
I've invited Olaf
to join our army.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.526
So when do you plan
to sail to York?

26:53.571 --> 26:55.197
We should wait until the spring.

26:56.824 --> 26:59.744
And after the birth
of my divine child.

27:06.626 --> 27:09.211
Why so cynical,
dear brother, huh?

27:10.379 --> 27:12.381
Cynicism poisons
your mind, brother.

27:12.506 --> 27:15.676
Eventually, you can't see the
good in anyone or anything.

27:17.553 --> 27:20.723
Can't you see that Freydis
now looks more like Freya,

27:21.807 --> 27:23.851
the goddess of fertility?

27:27.605 --> 27:28.606
No?

27:30.858 --> 27:35.112
It seems to me that
you are conflicted, Hvitserk.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.116
You jumped ship to be with me

27:39.200 --> 27:41.535
because you thought
the gods planned it.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.664
But then everything I say
or do makes you unhappy

27:44.747 --> 27:47.249
as if you never meant
to jump ship at all.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.586
There's no contradiction.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.256
Of course
there's a contradiction.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.675
What are you talking about?

27:56.175 --> 27:57.176
There's no contradiction

27:57.259 --> 28:01.305
because it's possible that
everything is part of the One.

28:02.890 --> 28:03.891
What?

28:05.810 --> 28:07.269
You're talking rubbish!

28:09.188 --> 28:10.332
You know, I've often wondered

28:10.356 --> 28:12.274
whether you weren't
a little crazy.

28:13.984 --> 28:14.985
I'm crazy?

28:16.112 --> 28:17.321
Just like Margrethe.

28:18.239 --> 28:19.824
You know what happened to her.

28:46.183 --> 28:47.685
We should have
arranged a sacrifice.

28:49.812 --> 28:52.481
We should have made an offering to
the gods to appease their anger,

28:53.858 --> 28:55.901
and ask for their blessing
for this new land.

28:57.486 --> 28:59.697
You think the gods are angry?
Of course they are.

29:00.573 --> 29:02.074
Ubbe renounced them in public!

29:04.285 --> 29:05.637
<i>And now Ubbe and Tom
wear the cross</i>

29:05.661 --> 29:07.496
of the Christian god
around their necks.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.795
I have to do something
for myself.

29:20.384 --> 29:21.635
I don't belong here.

29:23.345 --> 29:24.388
Do what?

29:26.766 --> 29:28.768
I want to take Kattegat
back from Ivar.

29:30.978 --> 29:33.606
How? You have no army.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.442
But King Harald has.

29:39.904 --> 29:42.072
I'II persuade him
to attack Kattegat with me.

29:43.032 --> 29:44.867
I remember something
my husband told me.

29:46.577 --> 29:50.706
He said that King Harald had told him
that, after their attack on Wessex,

29:51.332 --> 29:54.126
they would both return
and attack Kattegat together.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.587
Then he will listen to me.

29:58.255 --> 30:00.216
That, or he will just kill you.

30:13.562 --> 30:17.525
They killed your son
and they killed your daughter.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.820
Now we're being asked
to save these people.

30:25.908 --> 30:28.077
I'm going to leave
the decision to you, Ketill.

30:30.913 --> 30:32.581
You know me, Floki.

30:34.792 --> 30:36.627
You know I cannot
live without hope.

30:37.711 --> 30:39.505
I must have hope,

30:41.715 --> 30:43.342
for the future of my family.

30:46.136 --> 30:47.137
So...

30:48.013 --> 30:50.015
So you're saying that
we should try to save them.

30:54.770 --> 30:55.771
Yes.

31:02.319 --> 31:06.532
If Helgi says his father has
changed, then I believe him.

31:09.743 --> 31:12.121
And I will go through
this blasted winter myself.

31:13.747 --> 31:17.042
And if necessary, I will carry
Eyvind home on my own back.

31:40.357 --> 31:41.358
Helgi!

31:49.325 --> 31:50.326
Helgi.

32:02.087 --> 32:03.130
<i>(Mam GROANS)</i>

32:06.508 --> 32:07.509
Move!

32:08.761 --> 32:09.762
Move!

32:32.660 --> 32:34.244
I have made up my mind, Ubbe.

32:35.371 --> 32:37.539
For the sake of my mother,
and for my own sake,

32:38.874 --> 32:40.459
I need to try
to regain Kattegat.

32:41.377 --> 32:42.544
We need you here.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.005
There will be more attacks
and you know it.

32:45.839 --> 32:47.383
We have to defend
Ragnar's dream.

32:48.592 --> 32:50.636
We are all trying
to defend Ragnar's dream.

32:51.679 --> 32:53.972
But perhaps some of us
choose to do it differently.

32:55.599 --> 32:56.892
I understand what you have done.

32:58.394 --> 33:00.479
You have taken a path
I could not have taken.

33:01.814 --> 33:04.566
My brother, still my hero.

33:10.114 --> 33:11.115
<i>And Tom.</i>

33:12.866 --> 33:14.410
I also want
to say something to you.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.913
You have protected
and brought up our children.

33:20.290 --> 33:21.583
Even when I abandoned you,

33:24.294 --> 33:26.046
you were never
spiteful or vengeful.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.593
You were always loyal
to my mother.

33:34.430 --> 33:36.306
You never sought
anything for yourself.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.517
I love Lagertha.

33:39.226 --> 33:40.978
She has always
been everything to me.

33:41.895 --> 33:44.606
I know that she is still alive
and will return someday.

33:45.607 --> 33:48.444
She's a survivor, like you.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.906
I love our children,

33:54.992 --> 33:57.244
and I will always
make them proud of you.

34:07.880 --> 34:08.881
Thank you.

34:21.852 --> 34:22.978
My Lords.

34:24.938 --> 34:26.356
You will all have heard

34:26.440 --> 34:28.692
the news of the King's collapse,

34:29.651 --> 34:32.279
and that's why
I wanted to talk to you.

34:33.280 --> 34:37.117
To reassure you
that Alfred will recover.

34:37.534 --> 34:38.660
What is wrong with him?

34:39.244 --> 34:42.414
No one really knows.
Then he is weak.

34:42.706 --> 34:44.386
We need to know the truth.
What's going on?

34:49.004 --> 34:50.506
My mother is right.

34:52.049 --> 34:53.926
Alfred has suffered
these attacks before

34:54.009 --> 34:56.136
and has always survived.

34:57.679 --> 34:59.389
You must have faith.

34:59.890 --> 35:01.767
A king who is always sick.

35:03.060 --> 35:04.686
What kind of a king is that?

35:06.355 --> 35:08.649
We cannot afford a sick king!

35:13.362 --> 35:14.947
Aethelred is very popular.

35:16.907 --> 35:17.908
Yes.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.327
You can trust me.
Do you trust me?

35:20.536 --> 35:23.789
I had somehow hoped he would
not be quite so popular.

35:24.331 --> 35:25.749
And the church?
Yes.

35:25.833 --> 35:26.917
Thank you.

35:37.177 --> 35:39.304
What is it that
you say to these men,

35:41.056 --> 35:44.309
except that they should pray
for your brother's recovery?

35:48.230 --> 35:51.024
I say to them
what I have a mind to say.

35:53.944 --> 35:55.445
Don't interfere, Mother!

35:57.698 --> 36:00.075
Now go and make
some stinking borage

36:00.701 --> 36:02.411
to heal my poor brother.

37:28.914 --> 37:29.957
Your poor brother.

37:30.832 --> 37:31.833
Yes.

37:34.544 --> 37:37.756
If he died, would you be King?

37:39.800 --> 37:40.801
Yes.

37:47.015 --> 37:48.266
Then I hope he dies.

38:02.739 --> 38:04.366
It's Bjorn! It is!

38:05.033 --> 38:06.284
Bjorn Ironside.

38:16.420 --> 38:18.171
- Brother!
- Magnus.

38:19.464 --> 38:20.841
Bjorn Ironside.

38:25.095 --> 38:26.847
Well, come, come! Come.

38:31.018 --> 38:32.769
Bjorn Ironside.

38:34.896 --> 38:37.024
How happy I am to see you.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.234
And Gunnhild.

38:40.152 --> 38:43.488
It seems that fate has, after all,
brought us back together again.

38:43.947 --> 38:47.242
Who knew what the gods
had in store for us?

38:48.994 --> 38:50.662
Yes. Who knew?

38:51.830 --> 38:53.081
I don't care about any of that.

38:53.165 --> 38:55.250
I only care that
I've found my brother Bjorn,

38:55.333 --> 38:56.543
that I am Viking,

38:57.127 --> 38:59.880
and that we shall attack
Kattegat, all together!

39:07.888 --> 39:09.931
So tell me, how is my brother?

39:11.224 --> 39:12.726
There's no change
in his condition.

39:16.438 --> 39:18.065
I don't know
if he even hears us.

39:20.108 --> 39:23.737
I made some potions to try
to relieve his suffering,

39:23.820 --> 39:24.988
as I did before.

39:26.656 --> 39:30.619
You are a wonderful mother,
to Alfred, and to me.

39:40.879 --> 39:44.007
At least I know you care
about your brother.

39:45.592 --> 39:46.635
Why wouldn't I?

39:49.679 --> 39:52.891
It's just so terrible

39:53.850 --> 39:57.354
how the nobles begin
to conspire against him

39:58.855 --> 40:00.315
as soon as he's sick!

40:02.275 --> 40:04.319
They're not real Christians.

40:05.654 --> 40:06.655
They”.

40:08.031 --> 40:11.827
They have no charity
in their souls.

40:14.788 --> 40:16.248
They simply want
to get rid of him.

40:18.416 --> 40:22.254
It's true. And yet, you
must understand their fear.

40:23.338 --> 40:24.381
Hmm.

40:24.464 --> 40:26.133
Not only for themselves,

40:26.216 --> 40:28.593
but for Wessex and England.

40:52.492 --> 40:55.287
Of course, I understand.

40:58.874 --> 41:00.083
But surely...

41:02.127 --> 41:06.047
Surely they can see that
Alfred is their best chance.

41:08.258 --> 41:12.762
And if they care about
Wessex and England,

41:13.388 --> 41:15.932
then they must care
about Alfred!

41:18.310 --> 41:19.477
What have you done?

41:26.568 --> 41:27.777
I don't believe

41:28.695 --> 41:32.657
that you have ever accepted
your brother as King.

41:35.285 --> 41:36.661
I don't think you ever would.

41:40.790 --> 41:43.084
You would always
be a danger to him.

41:45.212 --> 41:46.588
So you've poisoned me?

42:09.569 --> 42:11.071
What kind of mother are you?
