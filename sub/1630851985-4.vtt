00:09.743 --> 00:13.412
<i>[Amy] There's this woman in here,
she's getting attacked regularly.</i>

00:13.780 --> 00:15.414
<i>So much fear with this person.</i>

00:16.750 --> 00:18.384
Very scared.

00:18.418 --> 00:20.786
I've been afraid
for my life here.

00:20.820 --> 00:24.323
I've woken up many,
many times being strangled.

00:25.091 --> 00:28.727
One's, like, on her face,
one's, like, on her chest.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.329
They're very aggressive.

00:32.932 --> 00:34.466
Any idea how many casualties?

00:34.534 --> 00:36.835
It was a bloodbath.

00:36.869 --> 00:40.939
I saw them holding them down
and assaulting this person.

00:40.973 --> 00:42.975
[sobbing]

00:43.009 --> 00:47.079
<i>[Amy] I am pretty worried
about the living here.</i>

00:49.149 --> 00:50.416
It wants the person dead.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.652
My name is Amy Allan.
I see dead people.

00:53.686 --> 00:56.922
I saw a winged creature.

00:56.956 --> 01:01.026
I speak to dead people
and they speak to me.

01:01.094 --> 01:02.895
This person feels
like a monster.

01:02.962 --> 01:06.065
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:06.099 --> 01:09.334
They are sucking the life
out of these people.

01:10.036 --> 01:11.570
I rely on my partner.

01:11.637 --> 01:12.971
I'm Steve DiSchiavi.

01:13.039 --> 01:14.740
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:14.774 --> 01:16.708
So how many bodies
are we talking?

01:16.776 --> 01:20.846
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:20.913 --> 01:21.914
It's my job to reveal them.

01:21.981 --> 01:24.083
But Steve and I never speak.

01:24.117 --> 01:26.218
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.553
Until the very end.

01:27.587 --> 01:28.520
[gasps]

01:28.588 --> 01:30.089
- You're not gonna like this.
- [sobs]

01:30.123 --> 01:31.857
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:31.924 --> 01:34.026
[crying] I'm sorry,
I need to take a break.

01:34.661 --> 01:36.161
Or time to get out.

01:36.196 --> 01:38.297
It wants inside the house
because it wants to kill you.

01:38.331 --> 01:39.865
[gasps]

01:50.710 --> 01:54.379
<i>[Steve] So I'm in Port Orchard,
Washington, it's a small, quaint town.</i>

01:54.447 --> 01:56.915
<i>It's about a 30-minute
ferry ride from Seattle,</i>

01:56.983 --> 01:58.750
<i>or you can just
drive it like I did.</i>

01:58.784 --> 01:59.751
<i>Takes about an hour.</i>

01:59.786 --> 02:01.854
<i>A desperate woman
named Caprice called.</i>

02:01.921 --> 02:03.822
<i>Says there's something
evil in her house</i>

02:03.857 --> 02:07.626
<i>and it's going after her and
her 16-month-old granddaughter.</i>

02:07.660 --> 02:11.730
The spiritual activity
in our house has reached

02:11.797 --> 02:16.135
a level of violence that is
completely unspeakable.

02:16.202 --> 02:17.769
I can no longer protect myself

02:17.804 --> 02:19.638
or my family.

02:19.672 --> 02:23.342
And the last person I want
to be killed or injured

02:23.376 --> 02:25.144
is my granddaughter, Chloe.

02:25.712 --> 02:28.780
<i>[Steve] Whenever a child is
involved, it gets my attention.</i>

02:28.815 --> 02:31.984
<i>One way or another, we have
to help this family out.</i>

02:39.092 --> 02:43.095
[Amy] Oh, God.
Oh, God. This is bad.

02:44.731 --> 02:46.431
I don't like this house.

02:47.934 --> 02:54.206
I'm feeling this woman
crying in here.

02:54.774 --> 02:57.109
I believe she's alive.

03:00.213 --> 03:02.881
I'm worried about
this young female,

03:02.916 --> 03:09.188
because I think there are
negative thoughts going on.

03:10.790 --> 03:12.724
Like she feels trapped,
and she feels tortured

03:12.792 --> 03:14.092
and tormented,

03:14.127 --> 03:17.496
and she feels like nobody's
going to protect her.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.097
Nobody's protecting her.

03:24.771 --> 03:25.704
<i>[Steve] I gotta tell you,
driving up here,</i>

03:25.738 --> 03:27.839
<i>this is a beautiful
neighborhood.</i>

03:27.874 --> 03:29.942
<i>But when we spoke on the
phone you sounded terrified.</i>

03:30.009 --> 03:31.210
<i>What the hell's going on here?</i>

03:31.277 --> 03:35.814
Uh... Um,
unfortunately too much.

03:35.881 --> 03:41.153
We specifically found this house to
have my whole family together, safe.

03:41.187 --> 03:44.089
And instead I feel like I
brought them straight to Hell.

03:44.156 --> 03:46.925
Okay. Who all lives
in the house now?

03:46.960 --> 03:49.161
Four generations of women.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.965
This is Jordi,
my 28-year-old daughter.

03:53.032 --> 03:55.367
This is Chloe,
who was one at the time,

03:55.434 --> 03:57.703
she's turning two soon.

03:57.770 --> 04:01.640
And this is my 20-year-old
daughter, Tessah, and then my mom.

04:01.674 --> 04:02.541
What all's going on?

04:02.575 --> 04:05.010
Who's getting targeted the most?

04:05.044 --> 04:08.680
Definitely myself and
my baby granddaughter.

04:08.715 --> 04:09.881
Okay.

04:09.916 --> 04:10.782
It's gotta be scary
with the baby. I mean...

04:10.850 --> 04:12.718
- Yes.
- What happened?

04:12.785 --> 04:15.754
The hard part is she can't
tell us what's going on.

04:15.788 --> 04:18.790
So one night I was taking
her to the bedroom

04:18.858 --> 04:22.294
and there was a human
bitemark on her stomach.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.696
Okay. So, you know,
whatever's here,

04:24.731 --> 04:26.832
if it's going after
somebody that tiny

04:26.866 --> 04:28.667
and it can do that kind
of damage, it's a problem.

04:28.734 --> 04:31.870
It's a big problem.
I'm terrified for her.

04:31.937 --> 04:34.273
All right, so, Caprice, do me
a favor and give me a list

04:34.340 --> 04:36.041
of what you guys
are experiencing here.

04:36.075 --> 04:39.945
<i>[Caprice] Shadow figures,
mood swings,</i>

04:40.146 --> 04:42.614
<i>night terrors, for sure.</i>

04:42.648 --> 04:44.750
And physical attacks.

04:44.817 --> 04:47.819
Let's get into the mood swings,
what are we talking about?

04:47.887 --> 04:51.723
In the last six months,
very violent mood swings.

04:51.758 --> 04:55.594
To the point where
a normal conversation,

04:55.628 --> 04:58.997
say, between my older
daughter and I,

04:59.031 --> 05:03.101
will turn into a
knock-down, drag-out fight.

05:03.135 --> 05:05.537
Are you only experiencing rage,
as far as mood swings goes?

05:05.571 --> 05:09.608
No. I would say, now
depression or sadness.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.411
Okay. When you guys are away
from here, how are you?

05:12.445 --> 05:16.415
Peaceful, happy, nobody's
at each other's throats.

05:16.582 --> 05:18.750
You're thoroughly convinced it's
a paranormal doing this to you?

05:18.785 --> 05:20.786
Yeah. I'm thoroughly
convinced.

05:20.853 --> 05:22.587
What do you think
whatever's here wants?

05:22.655 --> 05:27.059
I think the end result
is it wants to kill us.

05:29.696 --> 05:32.230
[Amy] I'm just hearing
people, like, fighting.

05:33.733 --> 05:35.867
<i>So these are the living
people fighting,</i>

05:35.901 --> 05:38.270
<i>there's a lot of
fighting going on.</i>

05:40.606 --> 05:43.008
I believe there's,
like, two females.

05:44.043 --> 05:48.013
One female is more
just devastated.

05:48.080 --> 05:54.252
Just... feeling not
protected, not safe.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.257
<i>The other female feels
very frustrated.</i>

06:01.828 --> 06:05.130
Living people fighting.
Oh, my goodness.

06:11.604 --> 06:13.372
[Steve] Okay, so what's
going on in here?

06:13.439 --> 06:16.808
For starters, I have
really terrible nightmares.

06:16.842 --> 06:19.878
Okay, if you can remember
them, describe what's going on.

06:19.912 --> 06:26.385
Usually, it's something
or someone chasing me

06:26.452 --> 06:30.055
as I'm collecting up my
children and my grandchild

06:30.122 --> 06:33.525
and try to get out of
the house before it gets us.

06:33.592 --> 06:35.494
What is getting you?

06:35.528 --> 06:38.797
Something very, very ugly,
creepy, demonic-looking.

06:38.864 --> 06:41.133
And how often are you
having these dreams?

06:41.968 --> 06:43.735
Several times a week.

06:43.803 --> 06:44.970
Okay. All right.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.342
[Amy] What the [bleep]?

06:51.511 --> 06:54.379
<i>This person's looking
out the door</i>

06:56.416 --> 07:00.152
and seeing these two little
things, like, floating in.

07:00.787 --> 07:05.957
Maybe 2 feet tall?
Like, maybe 3 feet tall?

07:05.991 --> 07:08.026
What the [bleep]
are these things?

07:08.594 --> 07:11.930
These things are giving
the living nightmares.

07:11.964 --> 07:15.700
They honestly just look like
little shadowy things.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.270
I can definitely make
out arms, though.

07:18.304 --> 07:19.905
But I can't like make them out,

07:19.972 --> 07:22.607
they're, like,
completely in shadow.

07:22.642 --> 07:26.378
But these two things
are not good.

07:29.715 --> 07:31.483
[Steve] All right, so
what else is going on in here?

07:31.517 --> 07:33.785
I go to bed,
and I'm perfectly fine.

07:33.853 --> 07:36.721
Take a shower before bed,
wake up the next morning

07:36.789 --> 07:42.828
and I have huge bruises,
scratches and burns on my legs,

07:42.862 --> 07:45.397
on my back,
places I can't reach.

07:45.464 --> 07:47.132
And what do they look like?

07:48.701 --> 07:49.734
There you go.

07:49.802 --> 07:52.003
Wow. Is that a burn
or a bruise?

07:52.071 --> 07:56.007
It is-- It's what they
thought was a chemical burn

07:56.075 --> 07:56.842
and a bruise.

07:56.876 --> 07:58.877
It was very painful.

07:58.944 --> 08:00.846
- They ever figure out what it was?
- No.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.647
What else is going on?

08:02.682 --> 08:06.117
I've woken up many,
many times being strangled.

08:07.353 --> 08:09.821
- So-- - Does it feel
like hands choking you?

08:09.889 --> 08:13.358
It does, but the weird
thing is, is it's cold.

08:13.425 --> 08:15.594
What's touching me is cold.

08:15.628 --> 08:18.396
That's scary. Any other
physical attacks going on?

08:18.431 --> 08:22.667
There's physical assault
that's... hard to talk about,

08:22.702 --> 08:26.505
That's essentially
every woman's nightmare.

08:26.572 --> 08:29.574
Can you describe
how an attack happens?

08:29.642 --> 08:32.911
The first one that I recall
that was really vivid,

08:32.978 --> 08:35.380
I was asleep on this
side of the bed.

08:35.447 --> 08:37.048
I was on my back.

08:37.116 --> 08:42.521
And something grabbed my right
shoulder that had claws to it,

08:42.588 --> 08:46.458
and in one fell swoop,
flipped me over, face-first.

08:46.525 --> 08:52.764
That particular scenario has
happened at least ten times.

08:52.798 --> 08:56.101
All right, so basically you're
getting sexually assaulted in bed.

08:56.135 --> 08:57.903
- Yeah.
- By something you can't see.

08:57.937 --> 09:00.672
It isn't just sexual assault.

09:00.739 --> 09:05.777
It's violent
and extremely painful.

09:05.811 --> 09:10.582
Whatever's here, that was it
exerting its complete dominance.

09:10.616 --> 09:12.951
I gotta ask you why
you haven't ran out

09:13.018 --> 09:15.287
of this place and
just never looked back?

09:16.088 --> 09:17.322
[voice breaking]
I've wanted to.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.158
I know.

09:20.225 --> 09:21.426
I want to.

09:21.494 --> 09:22.661
[sniffles]

09:22.695 --> 09:25.730
But I have my whole family
counting on me.

09:25.765 --> 09:29.467
I mean, I found this house,
I brought everybody here.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.469
And that's why I think
it's attacking me.

09:31.504 --> 09:35.373
And I'm hoping that I'm the
only one it's attacking like that,

09:35.441 --> 09:39.411
because I couldn't live with
myself if it did that to somebody else.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.651
[Amy] There's this woman in here,
she's getting attacked regularly.

09:46.719 --> 09:49.254
And it's from
these two little things.

09:50.456 --> 09:55.093
She's having, like, ugly
nightmares, sleep paralysis.

09:57.997 --> 10:02.934
So she's laying down and
these things are on her.

10:03.002 --> 10:06.204
One's, like, on her face,
one's, like, on her chest,

10:06.238 --> 10:08.373
forcing her down,

10:08.407 --> 10:12.243
so she can't even
like sit up or anything.

10:14.413 --> 10:16.581
They're very aggressive.

10:16.616 --> 10:21.920
Having these things attack
her, also then staying awake,

10:21.954 --> 10:26.257
trying not to fall asleep,
because she's scared.

10:32.098 --> 10:35.300
So much fear with this person.
Lots of fear. Very scared.

10:37.503 --> 10:39.037
Mmm-hmm.

10:39.104 --> 10:41.272
[Matthew] So what's the worst
thing it might be able to do?

10:41.307 --> 10:42.941
[Amy] Drive people crazy.

11:07.366 --> 11:09.768
[Steve] Jordi, talking to your
mom earlier, I gotta tell you,

11:09.802 --> 11:12.370
I'm really concerned about
what's going on in this house.

11:12.405 --> 11:15.040
- This is out of control.
- Yeah.

11:15.074 --> 11:17.075
She also told me that you guys
are at each other's throats

11:17.142 --> 11:19.144
to the point where
it's getting crazy.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.712
- Is that right?
- [sighs]

11:20.746 --> 11:22.380
Yeah, unfortunately.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.382
We've never been like this.

11:24.417 --> 11:28.420
There has been such a change in
my mom that, like, I've never seen.

11:28.487 --> 11:30.388
I've grabbed her
by the shoulders

11:30.423 --> 11:35.193
while she's in this rage and,
like, her eyes are literally black.

11:35.227 --> 11:38.563
So, one of the big reasons
that I took this case is because...

11:38.630 --> 11:39.698
sounds like whatever
she has is going after

11:39.765 --> 11:43.435
your less than two-year-old
daughter, Chloe.

11:43.736 --> 11:46.638
- Your mom is convinced she's in danger here.
- Mmm-hmm.

11:46.705 --> 11:48.573
- Do you feel the same way?
- I do.

11:48.640 --> 11:49.774
Can you tell me
about an experience

11:49.842 --> 11:51.910
that's made you worry
about Chloe?

11:51.944 --> 11:54.379
The worst would be
I was carrying my daughter

11:54.446 --> 11:57.182
<i>down the staircase
and I was pushed from behind.</i>

11:57.483 --> 11:58.450
Tell me what happened.

11:58.517 --> 12:01.619
So, I got pushed so hard
that I cleared the first

12:01.654 --> 12:06.958
set of stairs and landed with one
knee down, kind of like to the side.

12:06.992 --> 12:10.161
I had even rolled with her,
but she was fine.

12:10.196 --> 12:11.629
That was a lucky...

12:11.664 --> 12:12.997
Yeah.

12:13.065 --> 12:15.366
That you didn't get killed, or
something happened to the baby.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.703
All right, so what
else is going on?

12:18.738 --> 12:22.373
Well, I've been waking up
with strange marks on my body.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.376
Puncture marks and bruises.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.779
I do know that when you have
a low white blood cell count,

12:27.813 --> 12:29.447
- you get bruises.
- Yeah.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.416
So, is that a possibility
that's what it is?

12:31.483 --> 12:35.353
So, I checked that as well,
my labs were normal.

12:35.420 --> 12:37.622
Well, your mother thinks
whatever's here wants to kill someone.

12:37.689 --> 12:39.390
I've been afraid
for my life here.

12:39.792 --> 12:41.526
But it's one thing
to mess with me,

12:41.560 --> 12:45.063
but when you're messing
with my child, it's hard.

12:49.735 --> 12:54.472
<i>[Amy] These things are interacting
with the person in the bed.</i>

12:54.507 --> 12:57.242
<i>And I believe it's physical.</i>

12:58.677 --> 13:02.580
I don't know if they've been hit
on their back or pushed or what,

13:02.648 --> 13:07.185
but they've definitely
had issues with things...

13:07.553 --> 13:10.355
You know, with feeling
things on their back.

13:14.360 --> 13:19.063
But they are being like, physically
[bleep] with, that's not good.

13:26.138 --> 13:29.874
So, Tessah, I talked to your
mom and your sister, Jordi.

13:29.942 --> 13:31.342
I mean, this place
is out of control.

13:31.410 --> 13:33.711
Yeah.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.647
Your mom thinks whatever's here is pretty
dangerous. I mean, you agree with that?

13:35.681 --> 13:36.614
Yeah, I believe that.

13:36.682 --> 13:39.417
Tessah, what experiences
are you having here?

13:39.552 --> 13:43.388
I have seen shadow figures in
various places around the house.

13:43.422 --> 13:46.591
Okay, so where have
you seen these?

13:46.625 --> 13:49.894
In the living room,
in my bedroom.

13:49.962 --> 13:52.363
One in particular
got me very emotional.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.966
Out of nowhere I was
bawling my eyes out.

13:55.033 --> 13:57.502
Two minutes later
I felt perfectly fine.

13:57.569 --> 13:58.903
Okay, so anything else?

13:58.937 --> 14:01.840
One night I was sitting
in my bed doing homework

14:01.907 --> 14:07.078
and, all of a sudden, my bed
started shaking really violently,

14:07.112 --> 14:09.414
like somebody had
grabbed the bedframe,

14:09.448 --> 14:12.417
but nothing else
in my room was shaking.

14:12.451 --> 14:15.587
We're in Washington, could
it have been an earthquake?

14:15.654 --> 14:19.290
I go on my phone, checked
the earthquake map or whatever,

14:19.325 --> 14:20.959
make sure it's not an aftershock

14:20.993 --> 14:22.493
- from a different earthquake...
- Right.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.928
- Nothing.
- Okay,

14:23.930 --> 14:26.664
so you basically researched and
saw that it couldn't have happened,

14:26.732 --> 14:27.832
- as far as earthquakes go.
- No.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.601
This is a pretty serious case.

14:29.668 --> 14:31.669
That's why I don't understand
why youse is still here.

14:31.703 --> 14:36.541
This has been my mom's dream
since I was a little girl.

14:36.608 --> 14:38.142
I don't wanna see
your mom's dream get crushed,

14:38.544 --> 14:43.214
so hopefully we'll figure out what
the hell's going on and how to fix it.

14:46.652 --> 14:50.555
[Amy] Those little floaty
shadow things come in here too.

14:50.622 --> 14:52.156
[Matthew] Is it the same two?

14:52.190 --> 14:54.359
I'd say there's
about five of them.

14:54.426 --> 14:56.094
[Matthew]
They were all together?

14:56.662 --> 14:59.097
They don't
all huddle together, no.

14:59.965 --> 15:01.366
Feeling something on the bed,

15:01.433 --> 15:03.334
something jumping
around the bed.

15:05.638 --> 15:08.206
Living person's crying,

15:08.240 --> 15:10.541
'cause these things
are jumping around the bed.

15:10.576 --> 15:14.312
So, are those things,
like, tricksters?

15:14.379 --> 15:17.282
They're definitely tricksters,
okay, okay.

15:20.819 --> 15:26.391
Very draining energy, like both
from the [bleep] little trickster guys,

15:26.458 --> 15:28.927
but the living's energy in there

15:28.994 --> 15:30.228
is like a [bleep] nightmare.

15:33.098 --> 15:37.201
They're definitely feeding
into the whole [bleep] thing.

15:37.235 --> 15:39.037
And that's just bad.

15:56.722 --> 15:58.656
<i>[Steve] I was driving around
Caprice's neighborhood</i>

15:58.691 --> 16:00.692
<i>and drove right
by a huge casino.</i>

16:00.759 --> 16:04.162
<i>Turns out it's run by a tribe
that's native to the area.</i>

16:05.731 --> 16:07.799
<i>I'm on my way to meet
a local historian</i>

16:07.833 --> 16:10.902
<i>who says the Suquamish
suffered a lot of deaths here.</i>

16:10.969 --> 16:14.072
<i>But it wasn't all at the
hands of the settlers.</i>

16:21.880 --> 16:24.582
Well, Josh, thanks for
meeting me, I appreciate that.

16:24.649 --> 16:26.584
So, before we get to the
bad time these people had,

16:26.651 --> 16:28.853
what do we know about
the Suquamish tribe?

16:28.920 --> 16:32.190
Well, the Suquamish tribe were
really an incredible people.

16:32.257 --> 16:34.158
Go back thousands of years here,

16:34.193 --> 16:37.628
one of the most powerful leaders
of the Suquamish was Chief Kitsap.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.631
In fact, the county that you're
standing in right now is named for him.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.968
On the phone you mentioned
that the Suquamish tribe

16:44.003 --> 16:45.770
had a tough time but it wasn't
from settlers in this case.

16:45.804 --> 16:46.670
What happened?

16:46.672 --> 16:49.540
In the 1820s, Kitsap
and the Suquamish

16:49.608 --> 16:52.844
faced a problem from what's
known as the Cowichan tribe.

16:52.878 --> 16:55.680
They were up on what we now
call Vancouver Island in Canada.

16:55.747 --> 16:58.549
The Cowichan peoples
were coming down in canoes

16:58.617 --> 17:01.552
that looked a little like that
and burning, pillaging,

17:01.620 --> 17:03.588
and going through
the Suquamish's villages,

17:03.622 --> 17:05.723
really terrorizing
the Suquamish people.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.825
And that put Chief Kitsap
in a crisis.

17:07.893 --> 17:09.694
They fight back at all?

17:09.761 --> 17:11.863
You bet, yeah. Kitsap,
when faced with this crisis,

17:11.897 --> 17:15.533
he decided to paddle
some 200 canoes

17:15.567 --> 17:17.535
<i>across what's now
the Strait of Juan de Fuca.</i>

17:17.569 --> 17:19.437
<i>And they went through
each village</i>

17:19.504 --> 17:21.773
<i>and, of course,
did roughly the same thing</i>

17:21.840 --> 17:23.608
<i>that the Cowichan
had done to the Suquamish.</i>

17:23.642 --> 17:26.978
Burning villages,
killing the elderly,

17:27.045 --> 17:30.648
going through and kidnapping
many of the women and children,

17:30.715 --> 17:32.750
but there was one thing missing.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.452
The Cowichan warriors
were nowhere to be found.

17:34.519 --> 17:36.287
Where the hell were they?

17:36.321 --> 17:38.923
The Suquamish come back wondering
where are the Cowichan warriors,

17:38.990 --> 17:41.993
and lo and behold they find
them in the Suquamish's village.

17:42.027 --> 17:43.594
What did they do?

17:43.662 --> 17:46.964
Kitsap immediately orders all of
their captives from the Cowichan killed

17:46.999 --> 17:48.866
and the Cowichan tribe
does the same.

17:48.934 --> 17:50.368
That's pretty brutal.

17:50.402 --> 17:54.005
And that is right before
the big battle begins.

17:54.072 --> 17:55.406
Okay, so now
we've got this big battle.

17:55.474 --> 17:56.841
Any idea how many casualties?

17:56.875 --> 17:58.676
We don't know exactly
how many people died,

17:58.743 --> 18:01.412
but we do know that
it was a bloodbath.

18:01.480 --> 18:04.348
But Kitsap did ultimately
defeat the Cowichan.

18:04.416 --> 18:08.419
And any subsequent time that the
Cowichan did attack the Suquamish,

18:08.487 --> 18:10.655
Kitsap was victorious.

18:10.689 --> 18:13.991
After these battles, Kitsap became
one of the most powerful chiefs,

18:14.026 --> 18:15.726
not only in
the Puget Sound area,

18:15.761 --> 18:18.029
but in the Pacific Northwest.

18:27.139 --> 18:32.243
Someone or something was
buried in that little hill.

18:34.980 --> 18:36.814
It was buried by people.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.450
[Matthew] Can you tell anything
about why it was buried or who did it?

18:39.518 --> 18:41.319
I don't know who did it.

18:41.386 --> 18:46.357
It's very possible that it all kind
of goes back to Native Americans.

18:46.391 --> 18:52.130
I believe it was because this
thing was causing problems.

18:55.734 --> 19:00.271
It's, like, trying to get out,
so it starts digging.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.908
And then it stops
and it goes back.

19:03.942 --> 19:05.877
And then it starts digging again

19:05.944 --> 19:08.179
in a completely
different direction.

19:10.048 --> 19:13.351
The influence that
this radiates out

19:13.418 --> 19:14.852
is kind of like a nuttiness,

19:14.887 --> 19:19.123
so the energy that
it's emitting is crazy.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.595
<i>[Steve] When I'm in
the Pacific Northwest,</i>

19:24.630 --> 19:28.499
<i>I always check in with my
good friend, author Jeff Davis.</i>

19:28.533 --> 19:30.868
<i>He did some digging and says
one of the original owners</i>

19:30.903 --> 19:34.739
<i>of Caprice's property was a
guy who lived a charmed life.</i>

19:34.773 --> 19:37.275
<i>That is, until he set foot
on the land.</i>

19:46.552 --> 19:49.020
<i>[Steve] Well, Jeff,
it's good to see you again.</i>

19:49.054 --> 19:51.756
All right. So, this guy, what
can you tell me about him?

19:51.790 --> 19:54.392
His name was Charles Kittinger,

19:54.459 --> 19:57.562
and he came from Delaware.
And he came at the age of 20

19:57.596 --> 19:59.597
to open a private bank
with a friend.

19:59.664 --> 20:01.933
Okay, so, when does he acquire
my client's property?

20:02.000 --> 20:06.671
In 1889, he married
a woman named Amy Whitney.

20:06.738 --> 20:09.006
And about a month
after the marriage,

20:09.074 --> 20:12.210
he started buying up land,
including your client's property.

20:12.277 --> 20:13.778
Okay, so it sounds like
he's doing okay with the bank.

20:13.812 --> 20:15.446
Exactly.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.815
He's highly successful, he's
on the Chamber of Commerce.

20:17.882 --> 20:21.752
I'd like to think of them as
Seattle's young power couple.

20:21.820 --> 20:24.789
You told me that once he
acquired my client's property,

20:24.823 --> 20:26.724
everything went to hell
for him. What happened?

20:26.758 --> 20:29.961
It wasn't long after that that
they both turned on each other

20:30.028 --> 20:31.829
and started accusing
each other of infidelity.

20:31.896 --> 20:32.763
Okay.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.799
To the point that,
according to rumors,

20:34.833 --> 20:37.969
one time he actually pushed
her down the stairs.

20:38.036 --> 20:39.670
And when she got up,
he went and slapped her.

20:39.705 --> 20:41.772
[Steve] Did they stay
together or she split?

20:41.840 --> 20:44.141
Surprisingly,
they stuck together.

20:44.176 --> 20:47.745
They even had a daughter
in 1891. Her name was Emma.

20:47.779 --> 20:48.512
Okay.

20:48.514 --> 20:51.048
And here the tragedy continues.

20:51.116 --> 20:54.919
One day, after her second
birthday, she died of meningitis.

20:54.986 --> 20:56.087
Aw, that's a horrible death.

20:56.121 --> 20:56.987
It is.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.323
Soon after their
baby died, she left.

20:59.391 --> 21:01.759
She went first
to the world's fair

21:01.793 --> 21:03.794
and then she made her way to
New York, where she got a job acting.

21:03.862 --> 21:05.529
Charles, here.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.365
How's things going for him
while this is all happening?

21:07.399 --> 21:08.799
He was about as
successful in business

21:08.867 --> 21:10.968
after all of this
as he was in love.

21:11.003 --> 21:15.006
He defaulted on loans
and the bank started after him

21:15.040 --> 21:15.873
and he started getting sued.

21:15.940 --> 21:20.044
Finally, 1894,
the bank wins the lawsuit

21:20.078 --> 21:24.749
- and the property is foreclosed on.
- Okay.

21:24.816 --> 21:26.350
Leaving Charles with nothing.

21:26.418 --> 21:27.918
So, what happened to Charles?

21:27.953 --> 21:31.322
He went to Niagara Falls,
which was kind of a spa town.

21:31.390 --> 21:36.427
And he died at the age
of 39 of meningitis,

21:36.828 --> 21:38.062
like his two-year-old daughter.

21:38.096 --> 21:39.196
Really?

21:39.231 --> 21:40.331
Here's his death certificate.

21:40.365 --> 21:42.833
Wow.

21:42.901 --> 21:45.670
So even though he came from
something, he died with nothing.

21:45.704 --> 21:47.204
Exactly.

21:51.843 --> 21:55.946
This female came in.
She's tall, thin, blonde.

21:55.980 --> 21:58.616
She's in a bathing suit,
probably in her 20s,

21:58.650 --> 22:01.585
and she was standing by a tree,

22:01.653 --> 22:05.423
<i>And a man comes up that
she called, I believe, Charlie.</i>

22:05.957 --> 22:08.459
I'm getting...
I believe it's the male

22:08.526 --> 22:13.798
who's completely over it,
like, just done.

22:13.865 --> 22:17.168
And he hits her in the back of
the head and she goes down.

22:19.971 --> 22:21.305
[Matthew] Any idea
why he did that?

22:22.641 --> 22:24.041
Psycho?

<i>[Steve] So far,
I have a client who thinks</i>

22:50.836 --> 22:51.769
<i>something evil
is going after her</i>

22:51.771 --> 22:53.804
<i>and her 16-month-old
granddaughter</i>

22:53.839 --> 22:57.875
<i>on a property where a deadly
Native American battle took place.</i>

22:57.909 --> 23:00.311
<i>But I wanna see
if there's anything else.</i>

23:00.378 --> 23:01.645
<i>Searching through old records,</i>

23:01.680 --> 23:04.482
<i>I find the tragic story of
a teen who committed suicide</i>

23:04.516 --> 23:07.618
<i>just over a mile
from Caprice's property.</i>

23:07.652 --> 23:11.722
<i>What could make a teenager with
his whole life ahead of him kill himself?</i>

23:11.756 --> 23:13.791
<i>I've got a private investigator
looking into this case</i>

23:13.858 --> 23:17.027
<i>and I'm hoping she might
have some answers for me.</i>

23:22.901 --> 23:24.335
Well, Leigh, thanks
for meeting with me

23:24.402 --> 23:25.336
and helping me out
with this case.

23:25.403 --> 23:28.105
This victim, what'd you
find out about him?

23:28.139 --> 23:31.776
So the victim in this case was a
14-year-old boy named Freddie Jenkins.

23:31.810 --> 23:34.445
Well-liked,
active in Boy Scouts.

23:34.613 --> 23:37.648
Aw, he was a good-looking kid.
Now, was he an only child?

23:37.682 --> 23:39.049
No, he had three other siblings.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.551
He was the eldest in the family.

23:40.618 --> 23:41.819
[Steve] The eldest, okay.

23:41.886 --> 23:43.421
Do me a favor,
walk me through what happened.

23:43.555 --> 23:46.524
So, on August 20th, 1948,

23:46.558 --> 23:48.192
it was sort of
a family night out.

23:48.226 --> 23:49.894
The parents went off
to go to a meeting

23:49.961 --> 23:51.729
- at the veterans' club.
- Okay.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.564
And the kids were planning
on seeing a movie.

23:53.631 --> 23:56.934
The three younger kids saw
their brother drive by in a bike.

23:56.968 --> 24:00.004
They assumed that Freddie was
headed to the movie theater too,

24:00.038 --> 24:01.405
but he never showed up.

24:01.573 --> 24:02.473
So what happened?

24:02.507 --> 24:03.774
The kids come home
from the movie,

24:03.842 --> 24:06.477
wander around the house trying
to figure out what's going on.

24:06.511 --> 24:09.079
And that's when they see
their brother, Freddie,

24:09.113 --> 24:12.049
hanging from a rafter
in their mother's bedroom.

24:12.116 --> 24:15.519
Freddie was found dressed from
head to toe with his mother's clothing on.

24:15.587 --> 24:17.054
You're kidding me.

24:17.121 --> 24:19.657
And we also have two water
glasses in the kitchen,

24:19.724 --> 24:21.492
that the siblings did not use,

24:21.526 --> 24:23.394
that were there
when they came in.

24:23.461 --> 24:25.796
All right, so it indicates more
than one person was in the house.

24:25.864 --> 24:26.497
Right.

24:26.531 --> 24:28.265
Here's an article about it.

24:29.568 --> 24:32.403
All right, so did they deem it
a suicide at that point?

24:32.470 --> 24:35.539
Well, the coroner felt very
strongly that it was not a suicide.

24:35.607 --> 24:40.911
We know that he found some
bruising on Freddie's stomach,

24:40.946 --> 24:44.548
and we also noted that he found
two puncture marks on Freddie's neck.

24:44.616 --> 24:45.950
Really?

24:45.984 --> 24:47.318
Which have never
fully been explained.

24:47.352 --> 24:50.488
- The local sheriff was in charge of the investigation.
- Okay.

24:50.555 --> 24:54.792
- But he was never able to find anybody linked to the case.
- Okay.

24:54.826 --> 24:58.229
And his final verdict
was suicide by misadventure.

24:58.263 --> 24:59.430
What the hell is that?

24:59.432 --> 25:02.266
I'm not quite sure,
it doesn't make sense to me.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.402
All right, so it's 1948, how
did the town react to all this?

25:05.670 --> 25:07.805
Town was completely
freaked out by this.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.440
- Okay.
- By this death.

25:09.507 --> 25:11.775
The townspeople raised
enough money to hire

25:11.843 --> 25:14.612
their own private investigator
to look into the case.

25:14.646 --> 25:16.447
- Okay.
- And at the same time,

25:16.715 --> 25:17.882
the State decides
to get involved too.

25:17.916 --> 25:19.617
- Okay.
- And together,

25:19.651 --> 25:23.687
they decided they were going
to exhume Freddie's body again

25:23.722 --> 25:25.856
and look for new evidence
with a second autopsy.

25:25.924 --> 25:27.525
Did anything come out of that?

25:27.592 --> 25:29.793
Nothing came out of that
that we know of.

25:29.861 --> 25:32.763
So basically, it sounds like
this is still an open case.

25:32.797 --> 25:36.100
It is a completely
unresolved case.

25:39.971 --> 25:41.872
[Amy] Weird, I feel,
like, a death. Huh.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.974
Definite death vibe.

25:44.910 --> 25:48.012
I feel like there's a dead male

25:48.713 --> 25:51.215
and I think he's young. Hmm...

25:51.917 --> 25:54.518
He's like in his teens.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.187
I do believe that
he killed himself.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.657
[Matthew] Any idea
how they're seeing him?

25:59.691 --> 26:03.027
I think they're seeing him
like a shadow person.

26:04.696 --> 26:07.364
This is where the living
woman goes to cry.

26:08.400 --> 26:12.036
I'm worried about this dead
male who killed himself,

26:12.103 --> 26:17.608
and I feel like he's putting
that on to this living girl

26:17.642 --> 26:20.144
wanting to kill herself.

26:20.178 --> 26:21.712
[Matthew] Does he seem
to have any intent?

26:21.779 --> 26:26.016
He's lonely, so he may want
somebody to join him.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.661
<i>[Amy] I saw several
horrifying things on my walk,</i>

26:37.729 --> 26:39.563
<i>but two stood out.</i>

26:39.598 --> 26:42.733
First, the teenager
who committed suicide.

26:42.800 --> 26:45.669
Silhouetted, you know,
in the doorframe

26:45.737 --> 26:49.540
is this male figure.

26:49.607 --> 26:53.711
No defining anything
because it's all in shadow,

26:53.745 --> 26:57.514
more like just what you
could see as outline.

26:57.549 --> 27:01.418
Next, the tricksters attacking
a living woman in bed.

27:01.620 --> 27:05.823
So these things are like
kind of ball-shaped,

27:05.890 --> 27:08.392
so they have like little arms.

27:08.426 --> 27:11.061
Make them a little bit smaller.

27:12.998 --> 27:18.202
The hands look like hands of
a really elderly person.

27:19.838 --> 27:23.073
Amy, is this what you saw?

27:24.175 --> 27:25.642
Yes, that's what I saw.

27:45.864 --> 27:49.099
<i>[Steve] Now that Amy and I
have completed our investigations,</i>

27:49.133 --> 27:51.635
<i>we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other</i>

27:51.703 --> 27:54.038
<i>and our clients
for the first time.</i>

27:54.572 --> 27:57.307
So, guys, I'd like
you to meet Amy,

27:57.341 --> 27:59.710
she's gonna be doing the
reveal from another room

27:59.777 --> 28:02.880
so she can focus on your case
and the dead without any distractions.

28:02.914 --> 28:05.716
Amy, this is Caprice
and her daughter, Jordi.

28:05.783 --> 28:08.419
Now, it's a big house,
a lot of people live here.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.422
As a matter of fact, it's four
generations under one roof.

28:11.456 --> 28:14.858
This is Jordi's baby,
Chloe, in the photo.

28:14.926 --> 28:17.828
Next to her is Caprice's other
daughter, Tessah, who's what, 20?

28:17.862 --> 28:19.396
20.

28:19.464 --> 28:21.865
And that's Grandma in
the middle of both of them.

28:21.899 --> 28:24.134
The main reason we got
called in is because of Chloe.

28:24.202 --> 28:27.538
Caprice is convinced that
whatever's here is after the baby.

28:27.605 --> 28:30.808
And she doesn't even wanna think about
what could happen if we can't fix things.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.377
Now that Amy knows
a little bit about you guys,

28:33.411 --> 28:34.611
she'll either have
some questions,

28:34.679 --> 28:37.147
if not, she'll tell us
about her walk.

28:39.484 --> 28:43.587
<i>[Amy] The first dead person
that I encountered</i>

28:43.621 --> 28:48.992
<i>during my walk is
in and out of the house.</i>

28:49.027 --> 28:53.030
To me, he came off, his vibe
was that of a young male,

28:53.097 --> 28:56.600
possibly in his teens.

28:56.634 --> 29:00.971
And he appeared to me

29:01.038 --> 29:04.808
as more or less a shadow person.

29:04.843 --> 29:07.578
He's very, very sad.

29:07.645 --> 29:11.014
Extremely depressed individual.

29:11.048 --> 29:14.885
At one point I saw him
through the eyes

29:14.919 --> 29:19.223
of a living female,
and because of him,

29:19.257 --> 29:24.962
she was crying and feeling
this extreme depression.

29:24.996 --> 29:30.634
And so, I am pretty worried
about the living here,

29:30.668 --> 29:33.337
because his energy...

29:33.404 --> 29:36.373
he does push it out,
this depression.

29:37.709 --> 29:40.511
[Steven] Caprice, we talked
about mood changes, tell Amy.

29:40.545 --> 29:42.246
In the last six months or so,

29:42.280 --> 29:45.916
we've experienced real
significant mood changes.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.986
You also mentioned that you had a
lot of sadness and depression, right?

29:49.020 --> 29:49.686
[Caprice] Yeah.

29:49.754 --> 29:52.222
I almost classify it as grief.

29:53.424 --> 29:56.093
Amy mentioned that you may see
this kid as a shadow figure.

29:56.127 --> 29:57.995
Tessah told me about seeing
a shadow figure

29:58.029 --> 29:59.363
that made her depressed.

29:59.430 --> 30:00.697
Jordi, how about you?

30:00.765 --> 30:02.699
They just look whimsical
and it's black,

30:02.767 --> 30:04.868
and it's a shadow person.

30:04.903 --> 30:09.706
Basically stalks my daughter
and I around our bedroom.

30:09.774 --> 30:13.076
I had a sketch of what I saw.

30:17.081 --> 30:20.250
Okay, so you really didn't get
a detailed look at him.

30:24.856 --> 30:26.256
[Caprice] Wow.

30:26.991 --> 30:27.891
That's your bedroom.

30:27.926 --> 30:29.960
[Jordi] That's my bedroom.

30:30.762 --> 30:31.995
How do you know
it's your bedroom?

30:32.063 --> 30:35.098
[Jordi] This is literally
what I see, often.

30:35.900 --> 30:38.802
I'll sense him, I wake up,

30:38.870 --> 30:41.138
he's usually standing over
the side of my bed,

30:41.172 --> 30:45.909
I mean I've lost
so much sleep over this.

30:45.944 --> 30:49.913
So, Amy, did you get any idea on
who this kid was when he was alive?

30:49.948 --> 30:53.317
I did get that he was a suicide.

30:53.351 --> 30:55.586
I could tell that
he's slight build.

30:55.620 --> 30:59.790
I felt that he was young,
I would think teen.

30:59.824 --> 31:04.361
I did come across a suicide
of a teenager in my research.

31:04.428 --> 31:05.829
This kid's name
was Freddie Jenkins.

31:05.897 --> 31:08.131
Actually found a picture of him.

31:08.900 --> 31:12.836
So, in August of 1948,
14-year-old Freddie

31:12.904 --> 31:15.005
was supposed to meet his three
younger siblings at a movie,

31:15.039 --> 31:16.273
but he never did.

31:16.307 --> 31:18.008
So when the kids got back home,

31:18.042 --> 31:22.379
they found Freddie hanging from
a rafter in their parents' bedroom.

31:22.446 --> 31:26.183
It was a strange scene because
he was wearing his mother's clothing,

31:26.217 --> 31:28.919
and hung himself
with his mother's scarf.

31:28.986 --> 31:30.287
There was an article about him.

31:30.321 --> 31:31.655
Wow, that's sending
a message, okay.

31:31.722 --> 31:32.723
Yeah.

31:32.790 --> 31:34.558
Now, the coroner
thought he was murdered

31:34.592 --> 31:36.760
because he found
two suspicious puncture marks

31:36.794 --> 31:39.563
on his neck
and bruises on his stomach.

31:39.597 --> 31:42.432
But the sheriff was convinced
that it was a suicide,

31:42.634 --> 31:47.604
so to this day the case
remains basically unsolved.

31:47.672 --> 31:49.706
You... It made me think about,

31:49.741 --> 31:52.109
didn't you tell me about
puncture marks on your neck?

31:52.143 --> 31:55.679
Yeah, on my neck
and then on my lower back.

31:55.746 --> 31:57.347
[Amy] Oh, boy.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.551
[Steve] All right, so,
Amy, what else happened?

32:01.619 --> 32:05.956
I also saw there's some activity

32:06.023 --> 32:09.359
being created by the
living in the house.

32:09.894 --> 32:13.697
When I walked in,
I heard people fighting,

32:13.764 --> 32:16.500
so I think there's a lot
of fighting going on?

32:16.567 --> 32:18.535
And the energy in the house...

32:18.569 --> 32:23.206
Oh, my gosh, like,
the tension and frustration

32:23.675 --> 32:29.413
is physically consuming
and draining.

32:29.580 --> 32:34.785
I felt that one female,
I believe, in particular,

32:34.852 --> 32:41.959
is feeling trapped,
and tormented.

32:42.627 --> 32:48.398
And the other female feeling
frustrated and angry...

32:48.466 --> 32:52.102
Well, it's one of the main
reasons we were called in, Amy.

32:52.136 --> 32:54.905
Jordi thinks her mother has
become a totally different person.

32:54.939 --> 33:00.410
[voice breaking] She's literally no one
that I even know anymore sometimes,

33:00.444 --> 33:03.413
and I can't get through to her.

33:03.614 --> 33:08.418
It'll be something so small
and she just snaps,

33:08.586 --> 33:11.421
and it's like her eyes go black,

33:11.556 --> 33:14.391
and then she'll just blink
and nobody's home.

33:14.425 --> 33:17.327
And she's possessed
or something,

33:17.362 --> 33:20.864
I mean, the stuff
that comes out of her mouth,

33:20.898 --> 33:26.136
like... are just really
not her, and they're hurtful.

33:26.604 --> 33:29.072
And I don't remember
what is said.

33:29.106 --> 33:33.910
It's a burst, it's like
an explosion of angst

33:33.978 --> 33:36.446
and anger and then it's over.

33:37.982 --> 33:39.816
[Jordi] I need to take
a break for a sec.

33:39.851 --> 33:40.851
[Amy] Okay.

33:40.918 --> 33:42.119
I'm sorry.

33:43.788 --> 33:45.355
[Jordi sniffling]

33:45.390 --> 33:47.791
Do you wanna go see
if she's gonna be okay?

33:47.858 --> 33:49.960
She wants to be away from me.

33:49.994 --> 33:54.398
It's just she gets
highly emotional.

33:56.334 --> 33:58.869
- [Jordi exhales deeply]
- You okay?

33:58.936 --> 34:01.838
- [sniffling] Yeah, I apologize, I just...
- [Steve] It's all right.

34:01.872 --> 34:03.006
needed a second.

34:05.943 --> 34:08.578
[Steven] Amy, any idea on
what's making Caprice so angry?

34:08.613 --> 34:12.682
[Amy] So, during my opening
I was shown a hill,

34:12.750 --> 34:17.387
where something was buried by
people from a long time ago,

34:17.422 --> 34:19.623
because it was causing problems.

34:19.690 --> 34:24.861
I think that it's tied
to Native Americans.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.898
What I would see is
this thing in this hill,

34:27.965 --> 34:32.102
trying to dig itself out.

34:33.704 --> 34:36.706
The influence that
this radiates out

34:36.774 --> 34:38.708
is kind of like a nuttiness,

34:38.742 --> 34:42.312
so the energy that
it's emitting is crazy.

34:43.414 --> 34:45.715
[Steve] So, Amy,
a tribe called the Suquamish

34:45.783 --> 34:47.851
used to live here
for thousands of years.

34:47.918 --> 34:50.987
As a matter of fact, they had villages
all up and down the Puget Sound.

34:51.021 --> 34:52.722
In the 1800s,
they were terrorized

34:52.790 --> 34:55.625
by a warlike tribe
called the Cowichan.

34:55.660 --> 34:57.928
This tribe used
to paddle down the river,

34:57.995 --> 34:59.863
from the north,
to come over here

34:59.930 --> 35:01.765
and kidnap or kill
whatever they found

35:01.799 --> 35:04.434
- on the Suquamish villages.
- Whoa.

35:04.469 --> 35:06.570
I mean they destroyed them.

35:06.604 --> 35:09.773
Fortunately, the tribe
had a chief named Kitsap.

35:09.807 --> 35:12.609
Now, he led a war party
against the Cowichan villages.

35:12.676 --> 35:14.678
They attacked
the Cowichan tribes,

35:14.745 --> 35:17.948
camps they could find,
they killed the elderly,

35:18.015 --> 35:19.916
took the women
and children captive.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.718
These two sides fought it out,

35:21.752 --> 35:24.955
but Kitsap and his men
ultimately won.

35:25.022 --> 35:27.891
So that bloodshed
happened where we live.

35:27.958 --> 35:30.026
Yeah, in the 1800s, yeah.

35:32.663 --> 35:35.065
Amy, did you pick up
on anything else?

35:36.033 --> 35:37.567
[Amy] The next things
that I encountered,

35:37.635 --> 35:40.137
which are the biggest problem...

35:40.171 --> 35:44.241
Little shadow things that
were, like, maybe 2 feet tall.

35:44.308 --> 35:45.675
Oh, God.

35:45.710 --> 35:50.180
It took me a while, and I'm
like "Oh, look, they're tricksters."

35:50.882 --> 35:56.019
That definitely tied in
with what I had gotten prior,

35:56.053 --> 35:57.587
with the hill,
and all this kinda stuff

35:57.655 --> 36:00.090
and I'm, like, "This is
totally Native American".

36:00.124 --> 36:03.860
And there was about five or
six of them around your house,

36:03.928 --> 36:07.931
but there's two that
made me really nervous,

36:07.998 --> 36:10.967
because they seemed aggressive.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.370
I'm feeling something
on the bed,

36:13.404 --> 36:15.972
something jumping
around the bed.

36:18.676 --> 36:22.812
Caprice, do me a favor and tell
Amy about Tessah's bed shaking.

36:22.880 --> 36:26.016
She said it felt like
something picked

36:26.083 --> 36:29.286
the corner end of her bed
up off the ground

36:29.320 --> 36:30.820
- about a foot off, and...
- Oh.

36:30.888 --> 36:33.523
let it go, and it
just slammed down.

36:33.558 --> 36:35.825
Yeah, that would be a trickster.

36:35.893 --> 36:38.762
The ones that were
aggressive, what I saw,

36:38.829 --> 36:41.665
was that they were
causing nightmares.

36:41.699 --> 36:45.969
Oh, I have very, very,
very intense nightmares.

36:46.604 --> 36:47.871
I gotta assume
that these things cause

36:47.905 --> 36:49.773
a lot more than just
nightmares, am I correct?

36:49.807 --> 36:53.210
Yeah, they absolutely
can physically interact.

36:53.244 --> 36:55.712
Like I felt somebody being
pushed or hit in the back,

36:55.779 --> 36:57.981
being poked.

36:58.015 --> 37:00.750
This person's in a great
deal of physical pain.

37:00.785 --> 37:03.620
Tell Amy about
when you were carrying Chloe.

37:03.654 --> 37:06.523
I was carrying her
down the staircase,

37:06.590 --> 37:11.394
I got pushed from behind,
and went airborne,

37:11.462 --> 37:14.664
but I tucked myself
into a ball to protect her.

37:14.732 --> 37:17.667
[Amy] Wow. I got
that the tricksters

37:17.735 --> 37:19.869
were interacting
with someone in bed.

37:19.937 --> 37:24.541
Basically, I saw them
up on this person,

37:24.608 --> 37:27.444
holding them down,
and assaulting this person.

37:27.478 --> 37:31.214
And I got that this person
was extremely terrified.

37:31.916 --> 37:35.352
I'll wake up and I'll have
bruises on my inner thighs.

37:35.419 --> 37:37.654
One of them,
in particular, I woke up

37:37.688 --> 37:40.557
and I looked like acid burns.

37:40.624 --> 37:43.827
Went to my doctor,
there's no explanation.

37:43.894 --> 37:45.395
And this is the one
you were just talking about,

37:45.429 --> 37:47.397
the burn and the bruise.

37:48.633 --> 37:51.568
Tell Amy about being
strangled by cold hands.

37:51.635 --> 37:55.438
Oh, yeah.
I've woken up choking.

37:55.840 --> 37:59.009
It felt like ice-cold hands
on my throat.

37:59.043 --> 38:00.644
Mmm-hmm.

38:00.711 --> 38:04.748
I think we need to talk to Amy about
the other things that are happening to you.

38:04.782 --> 38:08.618
I know it's a tough thing to talk
about, but she needs to know.

38:08.653 --> 38:11.688
I've been grabbed
by the shoulder

38:11.722 --> 38:16.726
with what feels like
either jagged nails or claws.

38:16.794 --> 38:19.896
Flipped over, then I'm assaulted

38:19.930 --> 38:22.532
with something
that does not feel human.

38:22.599 --> 38:25.135
I did have a sketch done...

38:26.804 --> 38:32.242
of what I saw of these two
aggressive tricksters.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.147
Wow, that's strange.

38:37.214 --> 38:39.382
You're not gonna like
to see this, but...

38:43.421 --> 38:44.387
[Caprice] Oh, God.

38:46.123 --> 38:47.390
The hands.

38:48.392 --> 38:50.694
Definitely the hands.

38:50.761 --> 38:52.128
It's like a visual
representation

38:52.163 --> 38:54.764
of the terror that you feel.

38:54.832 --> 39:00.837
My biggest fear is that
these two weird tricksters

39:00.871 --> 39:03.173
would get more
aggressive with you

39:03.240 --> 39:06.676
and do severe physical harm.

39:06.711 --> 39:12.882
[voice breaking] It's hard to hear that
my worries and fears weren't just paranoia.

39:12.917 --> 39:17.220
I utterly [sniffles]
felt like I was going crazy.

39:20.658 --> 39:21.724
[sobs]

39:35.639 --> 39:38.908
[Steve] So, the good news
is you guys aren't crazy,

39:38.976 --> 39:41.177
but you got a lot of
stuff going on here.

39:41.211 --> 39:42.712
Now, to answer
the big question...

39:42.714 --> 39:47.384
Can you make this place safe for you
and your family, especially little Chloe,

39:47.451 --> 39:49.719
or are you gonna have
to pack up and leave?

39:49.787 --> 39:52.355
And for that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:54.692 --> 39:57.560
So, there's a lot going on here,

39:57.594 --> 40:00.397
and the majority, honestly,

40:00.464 --> 40:05.735
has to do with your family
and your family's dynamic.

40:05.769 --> 40:10.373
I feel that you guys need
intensive family counseling

40:10.408 --> 40:14.878
and I would highly suggest
a psychotherapist

40:14.945 --> 40:17.414
for that counseling
for the family.

40:18.582 --> 40:21.818
As far as
the paranormal's concerned,

40:21.885 --> 40:26.489
I would get a shaman that is
associated with the Suquamish tribe,

40:26.557 --> 40:30.693
to come and to remove
the tricksters.

40:30.761 --> 40:36.599
At the same time, removing
the dead male who killed himself.

40:36.634 --> 40:38.802
[Steven] What about the thing
buried in the hill outside?

40:38.836 --> 40:40.370
Will the shaman
also take care of that?

40:40.437 --> 40:43.306
Yes. Absolutely, yes. Yes.

40:44.008 --> 40:46.709
I'm grateful that it's fixable.

40:46.743 --> 40:48.344
I was prepared to burn it down.

40:49.213 --> 40:50.814
You guys are gonna
take Amy's advice?

40:50.848 --> 40:52.081
Hell, yes.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.750
I mean, all of it,
the counseling...

40:53.784 --> 40:54.918
Yes.

40:54.985 --> 40:56.886
Knowing is the power.

40:56.921 --> 40:58.988
Well, I'm glad we could help,

40:59.022 --> 41:00.123
'cause you guys
were pretty desperate,

41:00.190 --> 41:02.959
but you gotta feel good
knowing Chloe's gonna be safe.

41:02.993 --> 41:04.360
Yeah, I just think
you guys are great.

41:04.395 --> 41:07.330
You're amazing. Thank
you, Amy! [chuckles]

41:09.533 --> 41:13.503
<i>[Amy] I really hope Caprice and
Jordi seek out family counseling.</i>

41:13.537 --> 41:17.640
<i>If they do that, and call in a
shaman to clear out all of the dead,</i>

41:17.675 --> 41:21.144
all four generations of women
should be able to go back

41:21.211 --> 41:24.347
to living a peaceful
and happy life under one roof.

41:29.920 --> 41:30.653
Hi, Amy!

41:30.688 --> 41:31.754
Hi, Steve!

41:31.788 --> 41:35.859
Hi, guys! Well, we did
what Amy asked us to do.

41:35.893 --> 41:39.963
[Jordi] <i>I contacted the Suquamish
tribe elders for assistance.</i>

41:39.997 --> 41:43.900
<i>And the shaman came and
cleansed our house, our land</i>

41:43.967 --> 41:46.436
<i>and my daughter Chloe actually
now sleeps through the night.</i>

41:46.670 --> 41:49.672
So we wanna thank you from
the bottom of our hearts.

41:49.707 --> 41:53.142
We've seen 100% improvement

41:53.177 --> 41:56.980
and all of the activity is gone.

41:57.047 --> 41:57.881
Bye, guys!

41:57.915 --> 42:00.016
Bye!

42:00.050 --> 42:02.051
