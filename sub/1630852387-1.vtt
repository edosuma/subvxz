00:03.879 --> 00:05.756
(dramatic music)

01:14.784 --> 01:17.787
(dramatic music intensifies)

01:50.945 --> 01:52.655
What the hell?

02:00.579 --> 02:01.997
Come on!

02:11.382 --> 02:12.382
Hey!

02:14.385 --> 02:15.553
Right there.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.888
Hey, drive it or fuck it, pops!

02:19.682 --> 02:21.600
(screaming)

02:27.857 --> 02:30.943
(sirens wailing)

02:42.455 --> 02:44.582
Bring a stretcher,
he's still alive.

02:44.665 --> 02:45.708
Let's go!

02:49.253 --> 02:50.504
MAN: <i>According to
the truck drivers,</i>

02:50.588 --> 02:51.714
<i>the house was
flipped off the rig</i>

02:51.797 --> 02:53.090
<i>in the middle of the highway.</i>

02:53.132 --> 02:54.842
<i>Guy never knew what hit him.</i>

03:01.974 --> 03:02.892
MAN 2: All right, that's it.

03:02.975 --> 03:04.351
Keep it coming, keep
it coming, come on.

03:04.435 --> 03:05.644
Easy, easy.

03:05.728 --> 03:09.565
Okay, here we go, back
up, back up, back up.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.194
Get them outta here!

03:15.821 --> 03:18.699
(machines beeping)

03:23.329 --> 03:24.663
Still alive?

03:25.206 --> 03:26.499
His vital signs aren't bad,

03:26.582 --> 03:29.502
but with these head
injuries, I don't know.

03:29.585 --> 03:31.504
Probably never wake up, right?

03:40.679 --> 03:41.680
Hey!

03:41.764 --> 03:43.307
Geez, what is this?

03:44.934 --> 03:46.310
(groans)

04:00.908 --> 04:03.786
Hey, what the hell
are you doing, man?

04:03.869 --> 04:05.955
(groaning)

04:17.842 --> 04:20.261
(thumping)

04:20.344 --> 04:21.554
MAN: Get out.

04:21.637 --> 04:24.640
- I said get out.
- Okay, okay, okay.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.693
It's gotta be like this.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.987
Hey, come on, come on, man.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.073
Look, look at the tooth, man.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.741
Last time, you
broke my damn jaw.

04:42.825 --> 04:44.869
- No, it's gotta be this way.
- Come on, man.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.620
(grunts)

04:57.840 --> 04:59.216
Son of a bitch.

05:04.013 --> 05:06.515
(phone ringing)

05:16.650 --> 05:17.860
Hello?

05:17.943 --> 05:18.903
John?

05:18.986 --> 05:20.446
DR. LARSON: <i>No, is he there?</i>

05:20.529 --> 05:21.488
<i>It's Dr. Larson.</i>

05:21.572 --> 05:24.867
Oh, no, he's at the lab.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.243
Did you try him there?

05:26.327 --> 05:28.621
DR. LARSON: <i>I tried.
The switchboard was closed.</i>

05:29.705 --> 05:31.498
Is it news about his mother?

05:31.582 --> 05:32.666
DR. LARSON: <i>Yes, good news.</i>

05:32.750 --> 05:33.918
<i>She's regained consciousness.</i>

05:34.001 --> 05:35.794
Oh, thank God.

05:35.878 --> 05:37.212
DR. LARSON: <i>Come on
up here soon, Sharon.</i>

05:37.296 --> 05:38.881
<i>She could lapse again.</i>

05:38.964 --> 05:40.382
Oh no, don't even say that.

05:40.466 --> 05:42.259
I'll, look, I'll have him
there in 20 minutes, all right?

05:42.343 --> 05:43.427
<i>- Good.</i>
- Okay.

05:54.772 --> 05:55.981
Hart, you better
be getting home.

05:56.065 --> 05:57.691
It's damn near 2:00 a.m.

06:01.487 --> 06:04.031
You sure you don't need
any help, Dr. Hollins?

06:04.698 --> 06:06.033
Do you know what it is?

06:06.116 --> 06:07.451
No.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.579
Take a look.

06:14.166 --> 06:17.378
This is a class of renegade
proteins called prions.

06:18.253 --> 06:19.254
Prions.

06:20.589 --> 06:21.799
Hopefully they'll lead us

06:21.882 --> 06:24.635
to the cause of Alzheimer's
and other diseases.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.179
John?

06:27.262 --> 06:29.348
Dr. Larson just called,
your mother came out of it.

06:29.431 --> 06:30.736
He wants you there right away.

06:32.393 --> 06:33.394
How long ago did he call?

06:33.477 --> 06:34.477
20 minutes ago.

06:35.521 --> 06:36.730
Did he say what kind
of shape she was in?

06:36.814 --> 06:38.774
No, he just said get
there as soon as possible.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.025
All right.

06:40.109 --> 06:41.694
SHARON: We can take my car,
I left it by the front entrance.

06:41.777 --> 06:43.404
JOHN: Great, that'll save time.

06:43.487 --> 06:45.155
They moved her from
intensive care?

06:45.239 --> 06:46.573
SHARON: Dr. Larson said
we should ask for him

06:46.657 --> 06:49.660
at the desk, he wants
to talk with you.

06:49.743 --> 06:50.911
PHILLIP: John.

06:50.995 --> 06:52.287
Dr. Lloyd, good news.

06:52.371 --> 06:54.289
My mother's regained
consciousness.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.375
Oh, good.
That's great.

07:27.656 --> 07:29.324
Bury it.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.585
Who is that man?

07:41.545 --> 07:43.088
Dr. Phillip Lloyd.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.383
He looks like a well poisoner.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.552
(laughs)

07:50.471 --> 07:54.433
Well, he did work in germ
warfare research for awhile.

07:54.516 --> 07:55.684
Uh huh.

07:55.768 --> 07:57.978
He won every prize there
was except for the Nobel.

07:58.062 --> 08:00.355
He'll probably win that for
what he's working on now.

08:00.439 --> 08:01.774
You don't know?

08:01.857 --> 08:03.692
Nobody does.

08:03.776 --> 08:04.735
When you get to his level,

08:04.818 --> 08:07.384
you don't have to talk to people
about your secret projects.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.033
He worked with my mother for a couple of
years before she retired.

08:11.116 --> 08:13.660
I heard they had some
kind of a falling out.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.957
You've been great
through this whole thing.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.424
Don't let her talk too much.
And if she starts rambling-

08:27.508 --> 08:29.468
I never ramble.

08:31.678 --> 08:32.846
Hello.

08:36.183 --> 08:40.020
All the times I told you I
never want to be kept alive

08:40.104 --> 08:42.356
by extraordinary means.

08:43.816 --> 08:45.442
Why didn't you pull the plug?

08:45.984 --> 08:48.112
What is this, a complaint?

08:49.488 --> 08:53.033
It wasn't just an
accident, was it?

08:54.076 --> 08:56.870
No, you had a heart attack.

08:56.954 --> 08:58.497
You blacked out.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.544
- Did I hurt anybody?
- JOHN: No, just yourself.

09:07.131 --> 09:09.758
So what have you been
doing all this time?

09:09.842 --> 09:12.761
Sitting here waiting
for my eyes to open?

09:14.012 --> 09:15.430
Round the clock at first.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.226
Sharon was here for
a good part of that.

09:21.645 --> 09:24.648
You two didn't get married
while I was out of it, did you?

09:24.731 --> 09:26.066
Wouldn't you love that?

09:29.361 --> 09:30.971
So is there anything
I can do for you?

09:32.281 --> 09:34.408
You'll have to clean up for me.

09:37.161 --> 09:41.999
Go up there and burn everything.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.877
Burn everything?

09:45.794 --> 09:49.339
Make sure you find the data
relating to hemocyanin.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.384
It was promising

09:52.467 --> 09:57.347
but the side effects
are too dangerous.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.521
What is it?

10:04.605 --> 10:06.190
Mother, what?

10:06.273 --> 10:07.900
- What, Mother?
- I just remembered.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.611
Oh, dear God, that day.

10:11.612 --> 10:14.406
That day I went for a drive

10:15.157 --> 10:18.493
to find the courage to
do what I had to do.

10:19.494 --> 10:22.873
Oh dear God, he's still
living, he's still alive.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.166
Who's alive?

10:24.249 --> 10:29.421
Look, you must go up there
this instant, at once, today,

10:29.504 --> 10:31.465
and end the experiment.

10:31.506 --> 10:36.595
Burn the journals, the
Anthony journals, burn them.

10:37.429 --> 10:41.391
And don't, don't
be tempted, John.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.602
If you continue the experiment,

10:43.685 --> 10:45.270
who knows what he might become?

10:46.230 --> 10:50.859
Oh dear God, I never meant
for it to go this far.

10:50.943 --> 10:53.528
Calm down, I don't understand
what you're saying.

10:53.612 --> 10:54.696
Tell me what you're saying.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.448
Anthony!

10:58.784 --> 11:00.494
Everything is going to be fine.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.204
Who is Anthony?

11:02.287 --> 11:04.081
Your brother!

11:05.040 --> 11:07.417
DOCTOR: Quickly now, quickly.

11:08.669 --> 11:11.505
(animal crying)

11:32.859 --> 11:34.319
MAN: <i>Dr. Lloyd.</i>

11:34.987 --> 11:35.988
The hell are you doing here?

11:36.071 --> 11:37.823
I thought I told you
never to come here.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.741
<i>Good morning, Dr. Lloyd.</i>

11:42.327 --> 11:43.996
But now that you're here,
you might as well come in.

11:44.079 --> 11:45.372
Come on.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.715
What's the matter, didn't
Jackson reimburse you?

11:55.465 --> 11:56.465
I need more.

11:57.342 --> 11:58.510
Twice as much.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.435
You haven't fallen in
love with chemicals,

12:06.518 --> 12:07.894
have you, Harry?

12:07.978 --> 12:09.813
Hey, that's my business.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.274
All right, that's your business.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.029
Okay, tell you what I'll do.

12:17.112 --> 12:18.864
I'll give you $100 more.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.907
You're not hearing
me, Dr. Lloyd.

12:21.950 --> 12:26.288
Now I don't like to threaten
the people I work with,

12:27.331 --> 12:28.832
but if that's what it takes.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.089
Come with me, I'll pay
you what I owe you.

12:38.800 --> 12:39.800
Come on.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.515
I'm a leader, I fashion people.

12:46.391 --> 12:50.312
I not only change
minds and bodies,

12:50.395 --> 12:53.732
I change the course of
human evolution as well.

12:55.484 --> 12:57.444
This where you keep all
those braindead I bring you?

12:57.527 --> 12:58.612
This is it.

13:05.077 --> 13:06.203
Tell me something.

13:07.329 --> 13:09.164
You still afraid of me?

13:09.915 --> 13:12.793
Maybe you think I could
get you discredited with what I know?

13:12.876 --> 13:15.253
(laughs) Discredited?

13:15.337 --> 13:17.506
My friend, you could
get me arrested.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.717
You wouldn't betray
a friend, would you?

13:20.801 --> 13:21.927
Sure.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.555
Good thing you're not my friend.

13:28.266 --> 13:30.018
One thing I learned
from my daddy,

13:31.937 --> 13:34.564
never cross a guy who's
got the eyes of a killer.

13:36.108 --> 13:38.527
You think I've got
the eyes of a killer?

13:38.610 --> 13:40.195
Yeah, you do.

13:43.115 --> 13:45.534
(machine beeping)

14:01.383 --> 14:02.634
Hey!

14:02.717 --> 14:05.262
Hey, Lloyd, come on!

14:05.345 --> 14:08.640
Open up the goddamn
door, Lloyd, come on!

14:08.723 --> 14:10.183
Shit.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.853
(ominous music)

14:15.272 --> 14:17.983
(animals crying)

14:23.447 --> 14:26.366
(woman laughing)

14:46.011 --> 14:47.345
Can I get out through here?

14:52.684 --> 14:55.437
(dramatic music)

14:55.520 --> 14:57.939
(screaming)

15:05.489 --> 15:09.117
Dr. Lloyd, please, please let
me out, I won't tell anyone! Please!

15:14.206 --> 15:16.625
(screaming)

15:23.548 --> 15:28.553
No, no!

15:32.349 --> 15:33.642
John.

15:33.725 --> 15:34.893
How's your mother?

15:34.976 --> 15:36.686
Resting, under sedation.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.480
How did you find
out about it, Hart?

15:38.563 --> 15:39.940
Oh, no, I called your
house this morning

15:40.023 --> 15:42.234
to say I wasn't coming
in and Sharon told me.

15:42.317 --> 15:44.194
Then why are you here?

15:44.277 --> 15:45.779
Just one of the team, I guess.

15:47.656 --> 15:50.033
Any chance I can
have the weekend off?

15:50.116 --> 15:51.701
Not this weekend, no.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.287
It's my parents' 35th
wedding anniversary.

15:54.371 --> 15:55.789
We'll see.

15:57.374 --> 15:59.501
I knew that'd get him.

15:59.543 --> 16:02.546
(light music playing from boom box)

16:04.464 --> 16:05.464
MAN: Thanks a lot.

16:15.267 --> 16:16.393
Hi, Brad.

16:17.519 --> 16:18.478
(music stops, Brad's voice plays)

16:18.478 --> 16:19.437
BRAD: <i>Good morning.</i>

16:19.521 --> 16:21.231
<i>Listen, I'm trying to
quit smoking today,</i>

16:21.314 --> 16:23.692
<i>so therefore I'm not
speaking to anybody.</i>

16:23.775 --> 16:25.151
Sorry about that.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.988
BRAD: <i>Especially you, Hart.</i>

16:29.114 --> 16:32.117
(light music starts)

16:37.205 --> 16:40.333
Oh, more good news about
your mother, I hope.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.168
She's doing very
well, thank you.

16:43.128 --> 16:45.880
Dr. Lloyd, you've known my
mother a very long time.

16:45.964 --> 16:48.174
(laughs) Yeah, I would say
I knew her a little bit.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.093
I danced at her wedding.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.386
I wish I had some relatives

16:51.469 --> 16:53.972
that I could ask about
this, but I don't.

16:55.056 --> 16:56.641
Why don't you sit down?

16:57.851 --> 16:59.144
Thank you.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.772
You feel a little awkward
talking about this?

17:02.856 --> 17:04.482
Not at all.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.114
Did she have any other children?

17:12.115 --> 17:13.074
Children?

17:13.158 --> 17:15.285
No, she never mentioned
anything about a child.

17:15.368 --> 17:18.496
I hadn't heard anything
about it until last night.

17:19.748 --> 17:22.876
She mentioned someone
named Anthony.

17:26.463 --> 17:27.672
My brother.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.300
Did you know of him?

17:32.177 --> 17:33.177
Brother?

17:38.850 --> 17:40.685
I knew your mother on
and off for many years

17:40.769 --> 17:42.896
but she never mentioned
another child.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.523
Did she say anything else?

17:48.151 --> 17:49.319
No.

17:54.366 --> 17:55.533
Thank you for your time.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.703
Are you going back
to the hospital?

17:58.787 --> 17:59.954
No.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.289
I promised her that
I go up to the house

18:01.373 --> 18:03.917
to clean up some of her
unresolved experiments.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.836
I'll take some of the team with
me, whoever I can pry loose.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.213
Well, wait a minute.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.965
Home experiments?

18:12.550 --> 18:16.054
(laughs) Amanda was never
one to give up, was she?

18:16.137 --> 18:17.681
I mean, she'd hang on, boy,

18:17.764 --> 18:20.266
she'd hang on to a
dream or a nightmare.

18:22.852 --> 18:24.771
You take care of yourself.

18:26.481 --> 18:27.565
Yeah.

18:31.695 --> 18:32.737
Anthony.

18:34.656 --> 18:37.575
(machines beeping)

18:41.538 --> 18:43.331
Tell me about Anthony.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.584
I mean, how many
of them were there?

18:46.668 --> 18:48.712
Anthony Two, Anthony Three?

18:48.795 --> 18:53.007
How many were there before you felt
morally obligated to terminate?

18:54.217 --> 18:55.427
There were four.

18:56.386 --> 18:57.929
Four.

19:05.228 --> 19:06.730
And that was John's brother?

19:07.772 --> 19:09.441
What are you talking about?

19:09.524 --> 19:11.276
You see, your son and I, well,

19:11.359 --> 19:14.154
we're developing
quite a relationship.

19:14.237 --> 19:16.823
In fact, I think when he
comes back from your house,

19:16.906 --> 19:20.618
he's going to tell me
everything about Anthony.

19:21.828 --> 19:25.623
I'll see to it that he never so much
as looks at you again.

19:26.499 --> 19:30.503
I'll tell him all about
you and your sick dreams.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.505
He won't give you
the time of day.

19:33.882 --> 19:34.882
Well...

19:38.970 --> 19:40.847
let me tell you something, Amanda.

19:42.640 --> 19:46.102
I think you had better
tell me about Anthony.

19:47.812 --> 19:51.858
Before I go, I'm going to
put a stop to you, Phillip.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.944
I should have done it years ago.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.696
Where are you going to go, Amanda?

19:56.780 --> 19:58.281
You going to go to your...

19:59.157 --> 20:02.410
You going to go to your just awards?

20:02.494 --> 20:03.411
Are you?

20:03.495 --> 20:05.455
Now, now, now, now, no, no.

20:06.664 --> 20:07.916
Why don't you tell me?

20:07.999 --> 20:09.793
No, you tell me.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.753
You tell me where
your notebooks are,

20:11.836 --> 20:13.588
tell me where the records
of the experiments are,

20:13.671 --> 20:16.925
tell me what you did,
tell me how you did it.

20:17.008 --> 20:19.052
I want to finish
your experiments.

20:20.595 --> 20:25.892
I'm going to (coughs)
do everything in my power to finish you.

20:26.726 --> 20:30.563
I'm afraid, my darling,
you don't have much power left.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.982
(machines beeping)

20:35.276 --> 20:36.945
(machine flatlines)

20:37.028 --> 20:38.530
By her Christian faith,

20:38.613 --> 20:42.700
she was united with all
your believing peoples.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.870
Now in love and mercy,

20:47.038 --> 20:50.458
give her a place with
your angels and saints.

20:52.126 --> 20:54.462
Grant this through
Christ our Lord.

20:55.797 --> 20:56.631
Amen.

20:56.714 --> 20:57.757
- Amen.
- Amen.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.107
I'd like a minute alone.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.193
(kisses)

21:46.681 --> 21:48.141
You're her son.

21:49.475 --> 21:50.685
My condolences.

21:51.477 --> 21:52.395
Thank you.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.439
I'm Melissa Leftridge.

21:54.522 --> 21:56.357
I tried to get in
touch with your mother.

21:56.441 --> 21:58.311
That's when I found out
she was in hospital.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.320
Did you know her?

22:01.696 --> 22:04.198
No, not personally,
but she was my inspiration

22:04.282 --> 22:07.368
all through my years at Oxford,
then at the Cavendish lab.

22:07.452 --> 22:08.411
And I was hoping at last,

22:08.494 --> 22:10.663
I'd get the chance to
meet and thank her.

22:12.624 --> 22:15.015
She'd sent me a letter full
of praise and encouragement.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.130
I attempted my
paper on hemocyanin.

22:20.465 --> 22:22.133
Have you been working
with hemocyanin?

22:22.216 --> 22:24.636
Yes, I was experimenting
with it at the Cavendish.

22:25.720 --> 22:29.015
I had a theory that it might help
prevent bone disintegration in space.

22:30.516 --> 22:31.809
She shared my theory.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.313
You can imagine how
that made me feel.

22:35.396 --> 22:37.732
I rushed out and bought
every book she'd ever written

22:37.815 --> 22:39.943
and got copies of
all her journals

22:40.652 --> 22:43.488
and memorized,
not every word of course,

22:43.571 --> 22:45.323
just every thought.

22:45.406 --> 22:48.076
Have you read any
journals about Anthony?

22:48.159 --> 22:49.160
No, I haven't.

22:49.243 --> 22:51.204
Could I?
Are they available yet?

22:51.287 --> 22:53.414
No, not yet.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.089
Thank you, Miss Leftridge.

22:57.251 --> 22:59.295
I'm glad that my mother
was of help to you.

22:59.379 --> 23:01.839
I'm sorry you never got
to meet her in person.

23:01.923 --> 23:03.383
My sympathies.

23:07.428 --> 23:08.638
Miss Leftridge?

23:10.848 --> 23:11.933
Melissa.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.519
SHARON: Who was that?

23:14.602 --> 23:15.770
Melissa Leftridge.

23:15.853 --> 23:18.272
- Oh, you know her?
- No, but we'll all get to.

23:18.356 --> 23:20.358
She's coming up to the
house this weekend.

23:20.441 --> 23:21.859
With us this weekend?

23:22.610 --> 23:25.113
(calm music)

23:49.595 --> 23:50.972
Go on, Duke.

24:07.864 --> 24:09.282
A wonderful house.

24:18.249 --> 24:19.959
How long since you've been here?

24:20.043 --> 24:21.252
JOHN: A long time.

24:21.335 --> 24:22.628
Five or six years.

24:22.712 --> 24:24.422
- SHARON: Well, why so long?
- JOHN: I don't know.

24:24.464 --> 24:26.090
She liked her privacy.

24:35.516 --> 24:37.018
The refrigerator's down.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.939
JOHN: Guess the power's out.

24:42.023 --> 24:45.109
Didn't you pay the utilities
while she was in the hospital?

24:47.528 --> 24:50.823
No, look, I'd better call.
Maybe they can get here before dark.

24:53.910 --> 24:54.911
John.

24:56.621 --> 24:58.122
It's been disconnected.

24:58.206 --> 24:59.582
Well, maybe I can
get the lights on.

24:59.665 --> 25:01.751
There used to be a
generator back here.

25:14.097 --> 25:16.099
(crunching)

25:23.940 --> 25:26.984
(generator rumbling)

25:28.611 --> 25:29.611
SHARON: Look.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.991
Oh, the freezer must be leaking.

25:36.661 --> 25:38.162
The floorboards are all rotten.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.331
Something awful's down there.

25:40.414 --> 25:41.249
You smell it?

25:41.332 --> 25:44.335
God only knows how long this
has been without any power.

25:48.506 --> 25:49.507
(thumps)

25:52.009 --> 25:53.553
Maybe we better go check it out.

25:54.512 --> 25:56.347
I want to look at
the house with you.

25:57.890 --> 26:01.894
When I was in grad school, she'd come
down for a weekend every month or so

26:01.978 --> 26:04.105
and we'd go out to
these great restaurants

26:04.188 --> 26:05.857
and go for these long walks,

26:05.940 --> 26:09.735
talk about everything under
the sun except science.

26:15.658 --> 26:17.034
Your room?

26:17.118 --> 26:18.161
Want to see it?

26:24.834 --> 26:26.085
Are you serious?

26:36.888 --> 26:39.640
Well, she told me she was
going to continue with her work...

26:41.684 --> 26:43.269
but not to this extent.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.317
I'm glad I brought the group up.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.611
This could take a
week to organize.

26:51.694 --> 26:54.071
Well, I'm sure Miss Leftridge
will be a big help.

26:54.155 --> 26:55.990
Hey, I brought her up here

26:56.073 --> 26:57.533
because she knows more
about my mother's work

26:57.617 --> 26:58.659
than any of us.

26:59.535 --> 27:00.953
Nobody else seemed to mind.

27:01.996 --> 27:03.206
I don't mind either.

27:04.290 --> 27:08.336
The only thing upsetting me is

27:08.419 --> 27:10.504
this isn't your
boyhood room anymore.

27:33.653 --> 27:36.364
(gentle music)

27:51.045 --> 27:52.838
(barking)

28:18.322 --> 28:19.991
(whimpering)

28:24.495 --> 28:26.163
(barking)

28:39.260 --> 28:41.554
(ominous music)

28:59.780 --> 29:02.325
(scary music)

29:02.408 --> 29:03.409
(monstrous gurgling)

29:20.968 --> 29:23.554
(ominous music)

29:47.536 --> 29:49.163
Melissa.

29:49.246 --> 29:52.083
I didn't hear the doorbell ring.

29:52.166 --> 29:53.250
You forgot to lock
the door last night.

29:53.334 --> 29:54.752
I just walked in.

29:54.835 --> 29:56.379
I hope you don't mind.

29:56.462 --> 29:57.671
No.

29:57.713 --> 29:59.882
No, not at all.

29:59.965 --> 30:02.009
I decided not to
wait for the others.

30:02.093 --> 30:03.803
I wanted to start work early.

30:05.346 --> 30:06.597
In the middle of the night?

30:09.016 --> 30:10.408
John, what do you think this is?

30:12.812 --> 30:14.522
It's a schematic.

30:14.605 --> 30:16.273
For what, do you know?

30:18.109 --> 30:19.985
Some kind of an
incubation device.

30:21.028 --> 30:22.738
I can't seem to find the...

30:24.323 --> 30:25.491
Hello.

30:25.574 --> 30:26.742
Hi, I'm Melissa.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.704
I was just going to
go make some coffee.

30:30.788 --> 30:32.373
Great.
Would you like some coffee?

30:32.456 --> 30:33.624
No, not for me, thank you.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.293
All right.

30:46.971 --> 30:48.180
All right, now watch this.

30:48.264 --> 30:50.516
I want a cigarette,
I don't have a match, right?

30:50.599 --> 30:52.935
All I have to do is press
this little button right here.

30:53.018 --> 30:55.104
The cigarette will pop
out and light itself.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.147
Are you ready?

30:56.230 --> 30:57.231
CINDY: Yes.

30:57.940 --> 31:01.068
(machine whirring)

31:01.694 --> 31:02.987
Isn't that neat?

31:04.447 --> 31:05.531
(laughs) It didn't work.

31:05.614 --> 31:07.324
Well, it's not supposed to,

31:07.408 --> 31:09.452
it's for people who are
trying to quit smoking.

31:15.207 --> 31:16.876
Look at that dork.

31:16.959 --> 31:18.711
Why is he wasting his time?

31:18.794 --> 31:21.505
I mean, doesn't he know
she's not going to be up there with us?

31:21.589 --> 31:23.382
Wouldn't it ever occur
to you to be nice

31:23.466 --> 31:25.301
to someone you weren't
hoping to sleep with?

31:25.384 --> 31:27.595
I'm awfully nice
to you, aren't I?

31:27.678 --> 31:30.639
Anyway, what makes you so
sure he's not hoping to?

31:31.765 --> 31:34.268
Because he's still
hung up on me.

31:35.686 --> 31:38.230
I thought you said you
never have relationships

31:38.314 --> 31:39.523
with people you work with.

31:39.607 --> 31:42.193
Well, it wasn't supposed
to be a relationship.

31:42.276 --> 31:43.986
I mean, it was supposed
to be a weekend or two

31:44.069 --> 31:46.155
of fun and games
and he got serious.

31:47.615 --> 31:49.575
I didn't plan on hurting him.

31:51.035 --> 31:52.870
Why are you so down on him?

31:52.953 --> 31:55.539
Because everybody's
so high on him.

31:55.623 --> 31:57.666
Brad, you're a post doc.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.001
Grow up.

32:00.794 --> 32:01.962
Be really careful with that.

32:02.046 --> 32:05.508
It's my parents' 35th
anniversary present.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.303
Didn't know the
35th was watermelon.

32:16.227 --> 32:17.561
Excuse me, Sharon.

32:17.645 --> 32:18.896
John wants some tea,
so I was wondering...

32:18.979 --> 32:21.941
I can't, I'm busy.

32:22.024 --> 32:23.150
I didn't mean for you to get it.

32:23.234 --> 32:26.237
I'm going to.
I was going to ask if you'd like a cup.

32:26.946 --> 32:28.489
Oh, I...

32:29.782 --> 32:31.700
No, thank you.

32:32.785 --> 32:33.785
All right.

32:36.497 --> 32:38.916
(car honks)

32:46.423 --> 32:48.509
- SHARON: Hey, where have you guys been?
- Hi.

32:48.592 --> 32:49.969
Had to pick up a watermelon.

32:51.053 --> 32:52.054
I'm sorry.

32:53.222 --> 32:54.890
No, no, it was never the watermelon.

33:04.024 --> 33:05.901
Here, let me help you with that stuff.

33:14.910 --> 33:15.828
Melissa?

33:15.911 --> 33:17.329
This is Brad Baxter.

33:17.413 --> 33:18.539
Melissa Leftridge.

33:18.622 --> 33:19.540
Hello.

33:19.623 --> 33:21.083
How do you do?

33:21.834 --> 33:23.419
You still want that tea, John?

33:23.502 --> 33:25.796
No, thank you.

33:25.879 --> 33:28.716
This place is amazing.

33:28.799 --> 33:30.968
Your mother must've
been a real power tool.

33:31.051 --> 33:32.845
I mean, the whole
house is fantastic,

33:32.928 --> 33:34.847
with the possible
exception of the basement.

33:34.930 --> 33:35.764
Now what is down there?

33:35.848 --> 33:37.558
It's just a laundry room.

33:37.641 --> 33:40.352
I remember sliding down one of
the chutes from the bathroom.

33:40.436 --> 33:41.979
(soft lullaby plays)

33:42.062 --> 33:43.522
What is this?

33:43.606 --> 33:44.940
I love this.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.319
This is a lullaby my
mother used to play

33:48.402 --> 33:49.862
when I'd get rambunctious.

33:49.945 --> 33:51.614
It always seemed
to calm me down.

33:52.865 --> 33:55.367
Why don't you make a
couple of extra copies?

33:55.784 --> 33:56.785
Hart.

33:58.287 --> 33:59.413
Hi, Dr. Hollins.

33:59.496 --> 34:01.790
Everyone, I'd like
you to meet Melissa.

34:01.874 --> 34:02.750
This is Hart.

34:02.833 --> 34:04.209
Hello.

34:04.293 --> 34:06.295
JOHN: Nell, Cindy.

34:06.378 --> 34:09.173
- Nice to meet you.
- Okay, Hart, Cindy,

34:09.256 --> 34:11.467
I want you to start organizing
the research material.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.010
Anything that has to do
with the experiments,

34:13.093 --> 34:14.720
the research data,
and the sources,

34:14.803 --> 34:16.680
and anything you find
on the hemocyanin,

34:16.764 --> 34:18.599
I want you to take
directly to Melissa.

34:18.682 --> 34:21.393
She'll be working on that
exclusively from now on.

34:21.477 --> 34:23.395
Brad, I want you
to reconstruct any

34:23.479 --> 34:25.272
of my mother's
unresolved experiments

34:25.356 --> 34:28.108
and just see if you can
nail something down.

34:28.192 --> 34:30.986
I'm going to start looking
for information on Anthony.

34:31.070 --> 34:32.696
No sign of him yet?

34:32.780 --> 34:35.407
Maybe there are clues in
the journals she mentioned

34:36.325 --> 34:38.535
but I haven't been able
to find them either.

34:47.670 --> 34:49.338
I cannot believe he ran away.

34:49.463 --> 34:50.422
Duke?

34:50.506 --> 34:52.800
He's just out exploring,
he'll find his way back.

34:53.634 --> 34:55.461
What about you?
Any luck with the journals?

34:56.011 --> 34:58.430
Maybe she destroyed them
before she took that ride

34:58.514 --> 34:59.640
and forgot about it.

35:00.516 --> 35:02.226
Do you want to help
me with this stuff?

35:03.143 --> 35:05.062
(laughs)

35:05.145 --> 35:08.482
I'd rather take a
nice long bath before dinner.

35:10.526 --> 35:11.694
Wouldn't you?

35:21.370 --> 35:22.370
Wait.

35:28.210 --> 35:32.172
I just made a vow that
from this moment on,

35:33.966 --> 35:37.761
I will never kiss
anybody uglier than you.

35:45.936 --> 35:47.438
(kisses)

35:49.648 --> 35:52.276
(ominous music)

35:59.575 --> 36:02.369
(group murmuring)

36:05.372 --> 36:08.083
(woman laughing)

36:20.471 --> 36:21.722
He's so cute.

36:21.805 --> 36:23.056
Look at his bathing suit.

36:23.140 --> 36:24.892
- God.
- Oh, wait, look.

36:24.975 --> 36:27.269
This is John's room
before it was the lab.

36:27.352 --> 36:28.352
You're kidding.

36:29.188 --> 36:31.273
I think it looks
better as a lab.

36:33.317 --> 36:35.319
Is there anything better
to eat than stale donuts?

36:35.402 --> 36:37.613
I bought you guys cantaloupes.

36:39.948 --> 36:41.241
Always complaining, men.

37:02.387 --> 37:03.597
Don't!

37:04.348 --> 37:06.099
That's my folks'.

37:06.183 --> 37:08.060
I said you could
have cantaloupes.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.979
Hart, can you put it in my car?

37:11.563 --> 37:12.563
Sure.

37:19.488 --> 37:21.156
Oh, for crying out loud.

37:22.366 --> 37:24.409
Okay. Bye.

37:41.468 --> 37:44.137
(radio whirring)

37:46.598 --> 37:49.184
(ominous music)

37:54.314 --> 37:56.275
(watermelon squelching)

38:39.109 --> 38:40.235
(Nell gasping)

38:44.990 --> 38:46.074
(Nell screaming)

39:23.737 --> 39:25.072
(water splashes)

39:55.560 --> 39:58.313
You certainly take your
marine research seriously.

40:01.024 --> 40:02.609
Did you sleep here last night?

40:02.693 --> 40:04.486
No, I slept in
your mother's lab.

40:04.569 --> 40:05.487
Oh?

40:05.570 --> 40:07.406
Yeah, I went in there
after everyone went to bed

40:07.489 --> 40:10.033
and the next thing I knew, it
was time for my morning swim.

40:10.951 --> 40:13.036
Did you find
anything in the lab?

40:13.120 --> 40:15.914
One of your mother's older
journals is a detailed study

40:15.998 --> 40:20.085
of the rise and decline of 3,000
families of marine animals.

40:20.168 --> 40:22.462
Did you find anything
on hemocyanin?

40:22.546 --> 40:23.546
No, not yet.

40:26.174 --> 40:27.009
How about Anthony?

40:27.092 --> 40:28.677
Is there any
reference to Anthony?

40:29.928 --> 40:32.320
You don't really think you
could have a brother, do you?

40:33.140 --> 40:34.683
No, I don't think so,

40:36.059 --> 40:37.711
but I wonder what
she was referring to.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.981
Do you think she was
investigating hybridization?

40:41.064 --> 40:42.941
No, I don't think so.

40:44.359 --> 40:46.236
You're against it.
Why?

40:47.946 --> 40:50.949
I just believe every
creature has a right to exist

40:51.033 --> 40:53.744
as a separate
identifiable being.

40:58.749 --> 41:00.876
AMANDA: <i>Relationship study.</i>

41:00.959 --> 41:03.462
<i>It is the 28th day
of the hybrid's life</i>

41:03.545 --> 41:05.464
<i>and there is good news.</i>

41:05.547 --> 41:08.050
<i>The electrophoresis
chart has been positive</i>

41:08.133 --> 41:09.134
<i>for the first time.</i>

41:09.217 --> 41:10.844
<i>Anthony has started
to express the...</i>

41:10.927 --> 41:12.763
- Cindy, back that up.
- Yeah.

41:12.846 --> 41:15.724
(tape whirring)

41:15.807 --> 41:16.683
AMANDA: <i>Relationship study.</i>

41:16.767 --> 41:20.187
<i>It is the 28th day
of the hybrid's life</i>

41:20.270 --> 41:21.772
<i>and there is good news.</i>

41:21.855 --> 41:24.191
<i>The electrophoresis
chart has been positive</i>

41:24.274 --> 41:25.317
<i>for the first time.</i>

41:25.400 --> 41:29.154
<i>Anthony has started to express
the hemocyanin gene in his blood.</i>

41:29.237 --> 41:30.697
<i>There is no doubt in my mind</i>

41:30.781 --> 41:32.949
<i>that the DNA
incorporation has worked.</i>

41:33.033 --> 41:37.329
<i>I wish I could tell somebody
about it, the world preferably,</i>

41:37.412 --> 41:39.247
<i>but it's too soon.</i>

41:39.331 --> 41:42.209
<i>Very few would understand
what I've done.</i>

41:43.376 --> 41:45.587
(roaring)

42:07.192 --> 42:10.320
<i>Calm, Anthony, calm.</i>

42:11.446 --> 42:13.657
(Amanda humming lullaby)

42:13.740 --> 42:16.243
I guess she figured if it worked when
you got rambunctious.

42:16.326 --> 42:17.160
What?

42:17.244 --> 42:19.162
My mother used to play
that to calm me down.

42:19.246 --> 42:22.457
Do you have any idea
what she was trying to calm down there?

42:27.963 --> 42:29.464
Was it something I said?

42:36.012 --> 42:38.265
(calm music)

42:47.607 --> 42:49.568
Duke!
(whistles)

43:23.351 --> 43:24.351
Shit.

43:34.988 --> 43:35.906
Duke.

43:35.989 --> 43:38.533
(rustling)

43:38.617 --> 43:41.203
(ominous music)

43:57.469 --> 43:59.512
(screaming)

44:05.518 --> 44:07.854
(smacking)

44:14.194 --> 44:17.030
No, no!

44:18.865 --> 44:19.908
No!

44:22.827 --> 44:25.163
(groaning)

44:27.666 --> 44:28.875
Hart!

44:29.834 --> 44:31.628
My god, what happened?

44:31.711 --> 44:33.588
Go back in the house.

44:38.009 --> 44:39.052
John, help!

44:41.304 --> 44:42.430
(Hart coughs)

44:47.310 --> 44:48.561
Don't tell anyone what you saw.

44:48.645 --> 44:50.313
Say it was a mad dog.

44:50.397 --> 44:51.789
We don't want to
panic everybody.

44:55.568 --> 44:58.196
- JOHN: What happened?
- He said a mad dog attacked him.

44:58.280 --> 45:00.323
We should get him to a doctor.

45:00.407 --> 45:01.491
Hart.

45:35.692 --> 45:37.736
John, he'll be all right.

45:38.570 --> 45:41.239
We're going to keep him overnight anyway
but I'm pretty sure he'll be fine.

45:41.323 --> 45:43.491
Great. Can I see him?

45:43.575 --> 45:47.329
- Any idea what attacked him?
- We think it was a mad dog.

45:47.412 --> 45:48.830
You know where it happened?

45:49.247 --> 45:51.750
At Shelter Cove
near Great Point.

45:51.833 --> 45:53.293
What room is he in?

45:53.376 --> 45:54.711
The end of the hall.

45:54.794 --> 45:56.963
He's under heavy sedation
and in a lot of pain.

45:58.006 --> 45:59.049
Thank you.

46:12.979 --> 46:13.979
Hart.

46:15.774 --> 46:16.816
John.

46:20.028 --> 46:22.947
She's...

46:24.449 --> 46:25.492
She lied.

46:25.992 --> 46:26.992
Who lied?

46:49.641 --> 46:51.017
Hemocyanin.

46:52.310 --> 46:54.896
(ominous music)

49:01.856 --> 49:03.900
(liquid bubbling)

49:19.666 --> 49:21.960
MELISSA: Oh, my God.

49:33.763 --> 49:35.932
(Melissa screams)

49:37.976 --> 49:40.770
(Melissa gasping)

50:23.605 --> 50:24.897
How is he?

50:24.981 --> 50:26.774
He's going to be all right.

50:26.858 --> 50:29.777
Doctor's just keeping him
overnight as a precaution.

50:29.861 --> 50:32.238
Did he have to get rabies shots?

50:33.114 --> 50:34.449
It wasn't a rabid dog.

50:34.532 --> 50:36.993
- Yeah, Melissa said Hart told her...
- Perhaps I misunderstood.

50:37.076 --> 50:38.620
He was quite incoherent.

50:38.703 --> 50:40.204
SHARON: Well then, what was it?

50:40.288 --> 50:41.706
Could've been a coyote up here.

50:41.789 --> 50:44.208
A mountain lion even.

50:44.292 --> 50:46.544
I saw the results of
Hart's blood test.

50:47.587 --> 50:49.589
Whatever attacked
him left traces

50:49.672 --> 50:51.257
of hemocyanin in his blood.

50:52.050 --> 50:55.053
Well, that's impossible.
Hemocyanin is only found in marine life.

50:55.136 --> 50:56.638
Okay, so maybe this coyote

50:56.721 --> 50:59.390
or mountain lion had
just had a seafood snack.

50:59.474 --> 51:01.059
It doesn't work like that.

51:01.726 --> 51:04.937
Melissa, you're the
expert on hemocyanin.

51:05.021 --> 51:06.648
What do you think?

51:06.731 --> 51:08.775
Well, it needn't have come
from what attacked him.

51:08.858 --> 51:10.652
It could have happened
here in the lab.

51:10.735 --> 51:12.320
You know your mother
worked pretty extensively

51:12.403 --> 51:14.113
with the stuff and maybe Hart
came into contact with it

51:14.197 --> 51:15.948
without knowing how
dangerous it is.

51:18.076 --> 51:20.411
So we'd all better be
a little more careful.

51:30.630 --> 51:33.091
Have you had a chance to
look around for the journals?

51:33.174 --> 51:34.217
No, I haven't had time.

51:34.300 --> 51:35.718
I've been busy
playing house mother.

51:35.802 --> 51:38.096
Right now, I have to
finish this dissertation.

51:45.269 --> 51:46.854
Sharon, what's the matter?

51:48.564 --> 51:49.816
Everything.

51:49.899 --> 51:51.818
I came up here to organize
your mother's work

51:51.901 --> 51:53.653
and have a nice time doing it.

51:53.736 --> 51:57.031
It was just going to be
you and me and our friends.

51:57.115 --> 52:01.119
And then you invite her and
some sea monster attacks Hart.

52:01.202 --> 52:03.913
What's really bothering you
is Melissa's here, right?

52:04.497 --> 52:05.415
Right.

52:05.498 --> 52:07.375
I see how you are with Melissa,

52:07.458 --> 52:08.918
I see how you two work together.

52:10.086 --> 52:11.629
And you're also
attracted to her.

52:18.052 --> 52:19.429
Where are you going?

52:19.971 --> 52:21.597
I'll let you get your work done.

52:38.781 --> 52:41.784
If I didn't know better, I'd
think that you never slept.

52:41.868 --> 52:43.286
Oh, I do.

52:43.786 --> 52:46.205
But only an hour or so at
a time, it's my illness.

52:46.289 --> 52:47.707
What illness?

52:48.332 --> 52:49.375
Ambition.

52:51.377 --> 52:52.962
You know, Melissa,
I keep forgetting

52:53.087 --> 52:55.590
to tell you how glad I
am that you came up here.

52:55.673 --> 52:58.050
I haven't really been
that much help, have I?

52:59.218 --> 53:00.887
But I brought this
with me from home

53:01.679 --> 53:03.973
in the event of something
celebratory happening.

53:05.683 --> 53:06.768
Has it?

53:09.854 --> 53:11.564
It can, can't it?

53:25.286 --> 53:26.286
I'm sorry.

53:27.538 --> 53:29.040
I can't do this.

53:33.795 --> 53:35.004
Don't apologize.

53:36.923 --> 53:38.007
We'll be friends then.

53:44.889 --> 53:46.265
What should we drink to?

53:48.726 --> 53:52.188
Let's drink to memories
that don't get made.

53:54.857 --> 53:55.775
(glasses clink)

53:55.858 --> 53:56.984
But having said that,
don't be surprised

53:57.068 --> 53:59.070
if you find me sneaking
into your bed tonight.

54:01.739 --> 54:03.991
Careful, Sharon's
a light sleeper.

54:41.320 --> 54:43.906
(ominous music)

54:53.499 --> 54:56.294
(creature crying)

55:07.263 --> 55:09.307
Well, what do you think?

55:09.390 --> 55:12.351
It's amazing,
it's absolutely amazing.

55:12.435 --> 55:13.853
Just amazing.

55:13.936 --> 55:15.396
Does John know about this?

55:15.479 --> 55:18.608
Well, he's been looking at some journals
but not in the basement.

55:18.691 --> 55:20.192
For some reason,
it hasn't occurred to him

55:20.276 --> 55:22.153
that his mother might have
hidden anything down there.

55:22.236 --> 55:23.738
Well, I don't know
why you got involved

55:23.821 --> 55:26.073
with Hollins in the first place.

55:27.283 --> 55:29.660
I don't understand that,
it softened you up a bit.

55:30.745 --> 55:32.455
I mean, at this
stage of your life.

55:33.456 --> 55:34.707
I know.

55:35.291 --> 55:36.542
I don't want to go back.

55:37.668 --> 55:40.087
It's not just him,
I don't like spying.

55:43.466 --> 55:45.051
You owe me.

55:48.846 --> 55:50.368
Let me see your hands for a minute.

55:54.685 --> 55:56.604
Why are you so cold?

55:57.730 --> 56:00.024
The medication isn't
as effective as it was.

56:01.734 --> 56:02.860
Look, I need something stronger.

56:02.944 --> 56:06.030
I can't sleep and
I'm in a lot of pain.

56:06.781 --> 56:07.781
I see.

56:09.700 --> 56:10.785
All right.

56:13.788 --> 56:15.623
Here, tell you what you do.

56:15.706 --> 56:18.876
Use this. You go back the house
and you bring me Anthony.

56:21.045 --> 56:23.130
Bring me Anthony and
you bring me him alive.

56:23.214 --> 56:24.757
Look, I don't know where it is.

56:24.840 --> 56:26.717
It's not an it, it's
a him, it's a him!

56:26.801 --> 56:28.511
It was born in the house.

56:28.594 --> 56:30.638
It was spawned in Amanda's house.

56:30.721 --> 56:33.224
I don't want John to think
his brother is dangerous!

56:34.892 --> 56:36.268
I'll make a deal with you.

56:37.353 --> 56:40.314
You do this for me and I'll
make you a stronger medication.

56:42.233 --> 56:43.693
Fair?

56:48.447 --> 56:49.490
Fair.

56:57.456 --> 56:58.666
WOMAN: <i>Dr. Stone.</i>

56:58.749 --> 56:59.834
Yes?

56:59.917 --> 57:01.877
- WOMAN: <i>Dr. Hollins is here.</i>
- Okay.

57:02.670 --> 57:03.879
Is everything all right?

57:04.797 --> 57:05.797
Have a seat.

57:06.173 --> 57:08.384
Hi, I'm Cindy Russell,
John's assistant.

57:08.467 --> 57:09.802
How is Hart?

57:09.885 --> 57:12.179
Well, we're going to have to
keep him a couple more days.

57:12.263 --> 57:13.973
He's having more of
those convulsions

57:14.056 --> 57:16.851
and there's something else
I'd like to talk to you about.

57:16.934 --> 57:17.935
Have a seat, please.

57:20.354 --> 57:21.703
Do you know what this stuff is?

57:24.108 --> 57:25.317
No.

57:25.401 --> 57:27.820
DR. STONE: Thought you
might've seen it before.

57:27.903 --> 57:29.613
JOHN: Is that why you
brought us in to talk?

57:29.697 --> 57:32.408
Mr. Phillips' blood
tests showed heavy traces

57:32.491 --> 57:33.784
of hemocyanin.

57:34.577 --> 57:35.953
How do you think it got there?

57:36.037 --> 57:38.122
I see you know
what hemocyanin is.

57:38.205 --> 57:40.750
Last year, there was a similar
case in the same neighbourhood

57:40.833 --> 57:42.668
except the fellow
didn't survive it.

57:43.169 --> 57:44.587
Billy Kavanaugh.

57:44.628 --> 57:47.840
His blood showed even
heavier traces of hemocyanin.

57:48.799 --> 57:51.927
This morning, I pulled
his file from the coroner.

57:57.141 --> 58:00.019
WOMAN: <i>Dr. Stone, you're
wanted in ER right away.</i>

58:01.103 --> 58:02.730
You're eager to see
your friend anyway.

58:02.813 --> 58:04.065
We'll continue this later.

58:04.148 --> 58:05.816
I have some questions
I'd like to ask you.

58:05.900 --> 58:07.485
Of course.

58:07.568 --> 58:09.236
Doctor, could we get
a sample of this?

58:09.320 --> 58:11.489
I'm sorry, that's
against hospital policy.

58:11.572 --> 58:12.615
Sorry.

58:15.785 --> 58:17.036
(whispers)
Get a sample.

58:53.823 --> 58:54.865
Hart.

58:57.368 --> 58:58.452
Honey.

59:09.338 --> 59:11.841
BRAD: Let's see what we got here.

59:16.595 --> 59:18.681
Electrophoresis chart positive.

59:24.478 --> 59:26.021
Termination procedure?

59:37.408 --> 59:40.786
Brad?
Why are you working in the dark?

59:40.870 --> 59:43.080
Because I'm energy conscious.

59:44.582 --> 59:46.417
Because I checked the
generator a little while ago

59:46.500 --> 59:48.711
and we're almost out
of gas, that's why.

59:53.883 --> 59:54.967
How's Hart?

59:55.050 --> 59:56.886
About the same.

59:56.969 --> 59:59.555
- BRAD: What, are they keeping him there?
- Under heavy sedation.

59:59.638 --> 1:00:02.349
Melissa, I'd like
you to stay, please.

1:00:02.433 --> 1:00:04.607
I'd especially like you to
hear what I have to say.

1:00:06.770 --> 1:00:08.522
As far back as I can remember,

1:00:08.606 --> 1:00:10.983
my mother had a handyman
named Billy Kavanaugh.

1:00:11.692 --> 1:00:15.196
I found out today he was killed
a year ago near the house.

1:00:15.905 --> 1:00:18.032
I'm convinced that he was
killed by the same creature

1:00:18.115 --> 1:00:19.825
that damn near killed Hart.

1:00:19.909 --> 1:00:21.076
Creature?

1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:23.579
Oh, you mean the hybrid
you were worrying about this morning.

1:00:23.662 --> 1:00:25.789
I read the autopsy report.

1:00:25.873 --> 1:00:28.959
There are heavy traces of
hemocyanin in his blood.

1:00:30.127 --> 1:00:31.378
You surprised me this morning

1:00:31.462 --> 1:00:33.839
when you told me that blood
tests aren't always accurate.

1:00:33.923 --> 1:00:35.049
MELISSA: Why, it's true, isn't it?

1:00:35.132 --> 1:00:37.593
Do you seriously believe
that anyone would even think

1:00:37.676 --> 1:00:39.553
of hemocyanin
unless it was there?

1:00:39.637 --> 1:00:41.805
What I can't understand
is why you're so convinced

1:00:41.889 --> 1:00:43.557
there's some sort
of hybrid here.

1:00:43.641 --> 1:00:46.435
Well, if you can convince me
differently, then please do.

1:00:46.518 --> 1:00:47.770
Look, I've been here all day.

1:00:47.853 --> 1:00:50.648
So has Brad and Sharon and
we've seen or heard nothing.

1:00:50.731 --> 1:00:52.566
JOHN: Does that prove
that it isn't here?

1:00:52.650 --> 1:00:53.901
No, of course not.

1:00:53.984 --> 1:00:55.236
But your being afraid it's here

1:00:55.319 --> 1:00:56.737
doesn't prove anything either.

1:00:56.820 --> 1:00:58.197
You haven't seen it, have you?

1:00:58.280 --> 1:01:01.450
I saw what it did to Hart and
I read a graphic description

1:01:01.533 --> 1:01:03.160
of what happened
to Billy Kavanaugh.

1:01:03.244 --> 1:01:04.954
Look, maybe we should
all just get out of here.

1:01:05.037 --> 1:01:07.539
Yes, I want all you
guys to take off.

1:01:07.623 --> 1:01:08.624
- What do you mean take off?
- John.

1:01:08.707 --> 1:01:10.751
Wait, what do you mean you guys?
What about you?

1:01:11.752 --> 1:01:14.129
I have to stay here
and terminate it.

1:01:14.213 --> 1:01:15.881
You out of your mind?

1:01:17.716 --> 1:01:20.094
Look, if your mother did
achieve this miracle,

1:01:20.177 --> 1:01:21.971
do you honestly believe
she'd want it destroyed?

1:01:22.054 --> 1:01:23.389
She would have
done the same thing

1:01:23.472 --> 1:01:24.682
if she hadn't had
a heart attack.

1:01:24.765 --> 1:01:27.184
Does thinking that make you
feel better about her, John?

1:01:27.268 --> 1:01:29.603
She sent me up here
to end the experiment.

1:01:29.687 --> 1:01:30.854
Those were her words.

1:01:30.938 --> 1:01:32.523
She was sick and dying.

1:01:35.025 --> 1:01:37.736
The Amanda Hollins I admired
wouldn't in a million years

1:01:37.820 --> 1:01:40.489
end such an experiment,
not for any reason.

1:01:40.572 --> 1:01:43.158
Why is this so important
to you, Melissa?

1:01:45.744 --> 1:01:47.454
Goddamn generator.

1:01:47.538 --> 1:01:49.039
I'll take care of it.

1:01:57.756 --> 1:02:00.968
Melissa, did you take
the car out last night?

1:02:02.845 --> 1:02:06.807
- (thunder crashing)
- John, there's your culprit.

1:02:08.559 --> 1:02:09.643
Great.

1:02:24.658 --> 1:02:26.452
Did you do this
last night, Brad?

1:02:28.454 --> 1:02:29.538
What are you talking about?

1:02:29.621 --> 1:02:31.332
I'm talking about taking
the gas out of my car

1:02:31.415 --> 1:02:32.416
and putting it in the generator.

1:02:32.499 --> 1:02:34.418
BRAD: Why, what
gave you that idea?

1:02:34.501 --> 1:02:35.502
Because I had a
full tank last night

1:02:35.586 --> 1:02:37.171
and this morning
it's almost empty.

1:02:37.254 --> 1:02:38.714
Well, don't look at me.

1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:41.717
Did you go out for cigarettes?

1:02:44.345 --> 1:02:47.014
That is the one I keep
in case of nuclear war.

1:02:48.223 --> 1:02:50.809
- Haven't even touched a cigarette.
- JOHN: Okay.

1:02:50.893 --> 1:02:53.729
- It might've been Melissa.
- What makes you say that?

1:02:53.812 --> 1:02:56.065
Well, there's something
fishy about the girl.

1:02:56.148 --> 1:02:57.524
I kissed her the other night.

1:02:57.608 --> 1:03:00.903
It's nothing important, just
a little get acquainted offer.

1:03:00.986 --> 1:03:02.154
I was sorry I did.

1:03:02.237 --> 1:03:03.739
JOHN: Why?

1:03:03.822 --> 1:03:04.948
Because it felt like
I was pressing my lips

1:03:05.032 --> 1:03:06.909
to a chilled shrimp.

1:03:06.992 --> 1:03:08.952
What are you talking
about shrimp for?

1:03:10.245 --> 1:03:12.831
Are you aware that you're
angry at me for no reason?

1:03:12.915 --> 1:03:14.917
- I'm not angry at you.
- Who then?

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:16.293
I don't know, nobody!

1:03:16.377 --> 1:03:18.003
Now that things are getting
a little heated here,

1:03:18.087 --> 1:03:20.005
you mind if I tell you what
I think has been happening

1:03:20.089 --> 1:03:21.882
to you since we came up here?

1:03:21.965 --> 1:03:23.926
I think you're going crazy!

1:03:24.009 --> 1:03:26.178
In an imaginative kind of a way.

1:03:26.261 --> 1:03:27.679
JOHN: What are you talking about?

1:03:27.763 --> 1:03:29.056
All right, first you
search high and low

1:03:29.139 --> 1:03:31.058
for a brother that
nobody has ever heard of.

1:03:31.141 --> 1:03:33.018
Now you're trying to
find, what, some hybrid

1:03:33.102 --> 1:03:35.187
that attacks only
handymen and dorks.

1:03:35.270 --> 1:03:36.270
If that's not...

1:03:38.690 --> 1:03:39.900
What?

1:03:40.818 --> 1:03:42.194
What is it?

1:03:42.277 --> 1:03:43.904
(dramatic music)

1:03:47.449 --> 1:03:49.201
Hey, wait a second, John!

1:03:50.828 --> 1:03:52.037
- John.
- Your purse.

1:03:52.121 --> 1:03:53.497
- Ow, what?
- Your purse, your purse.

1:03:53.580 --> 1:03:54.580
John.

1:03:56.041 --> 1:03:57.418
What's going on?

1:04:00.295 --> 1:04:02.339
- John.
- What are you doing?

1:04:02.423 --> 1:04:03.424
- John.
- John.

1:04:03.507 --> 1:04:04.925
For Christ's sake,
all you have to do is

1:04:05.008 --> 1:04:06.218
tell us what you're doing
and we can help you, yeah?

1:04:06.301 --> 1:04:09.430
- Is there something we can...
- Quiet, please, just be quiet.

1:04:09.513 --> 1:04:11.557
Give me a chance.
All right?

1:04:35.080 --> 1:04:36.832
- John!
- What the hell are you doing?

1:04:39.334 --> 1:04:40.586
I don't believe this.

1:05:23.629 --> 1:05:24.671
BRAD: What is it?

1:05:25.839 --> 1:05:27.883
- They're identical.
- Meaning what?

1:05:27.966 --> 1:05:29.092
Can somebody tell me
what this stuff is?

1:05:29.176 --> 1:05:31.428
That came from the same
thing that attacked Hart.

1:05:31.512 --> 1:05:33.514
- What?
- Meaning the thing that attacked Hart

1:05:33.597 --> 1:05:35.599
and the thing that my
mother's calling Anthony,

1:05:35.682 --> 1:05:37.976
my brother,
are one and the same.

1:05:38.060 --> 1:05:39.478
I don't understand this.

1:05:39.561 --> 1:05:41.563
How can that thing
be your brother?

1:05:41.647 --> 1:05:44.191
A long time ago, I let my
mother take some of my tissue.

1:05:44.274 --> 1:05:45.734
She needed some human cells

1:05:45.817 --> 1:05:47.819
for experiments
she was working on.

1:05:47.903 --> 1:05:50.322
Apparently she spliced them
into some animal species

1:05:50.405 --> 1:05:52.699
of some kind,
God only knows what.

1:05:52.783 --> 1:05:54.576
She made a hybrid.

1:05:54.660 --> 1:05:56.203
She must've started
calling it Anthony

1:05:56.286 --> 1:05:57.871
after her favorite saint.

1:05:57.955 --> 1:06:01.833
I guess it was just to
make it more human for her,

1:06:01.917 --> 1:06:04.127
less unnatural.

1:06:05.671 --> 1:06:07.881
(roaring)

1:06:09.258 --> 1:06:10.259
Brad?

1:06:13.637 --> 1:06:15.055
I'll get the car.

1:06:26.692 --> 1:06:29.111
(car engine whirring)

1:06:37.202 --> 1:06:42.124
- (dramatic music)
- (roaring)

1:06:42.916 --> 1:06:44.167
No!

1:06:47.462 --> 1:06:48.672
Jeez!

1:06:51.717 --> 1:06:53.468
CINDY: Brad, Brad!

1:07:08.275 --> 1:07:09.901
(car crashing)

1:07:12.195 --> 1:07:13.195
Let's go.

1:07:14.406 --> 1:07:15.657
Let's go.

1:07:15.741 --> 1:07:16.783
Come on!

1:07:21.788 --> 1:07:24.041
WOMAN (over PA):
<i>Nurse Perry to the nurse's station.</i>

1:07:24.124 --> 1:07:27.711
<i>Nurse Perry, please report
to the nurse's station.</i>

1:07:28.754 --> 1:07:30.172
No, no, it's all right.

1:07:30.255 --> 1:07:32.049
I just have to take some blood.

1:07:32.132 --> 1:07:33.884
I gotta warn my friends,
I gotta warn 'em!

1:07:33.967 --> 1:07:36.595
Stay in bed. You're in no condition
to be getting out.

1:07:36.678 --> 1:07:39.389
Come on now, you're
gonna hurt yourself.

1:07:39.473 --> 1:07:41.600
Code red, west wing, stat.

1:07:41.683 --> 1:07:42.934
<i>Code red, stat!</i>

1:07:45.354 --> 1:07:46.647
Hey, hey, come on!

1:07:46.730 --> 1:07:47.730
Come on, man!

1:07:48.940 --> 1:07:51.693
Let me go, get out of my way!

1:07:52.694 --> 1:07:54.694
- Call security.
- Come on, this way, this way.

1:07:56.657 --> 1:07:57.949
Hey you, come on!

1:08:00.535 --> 1:08:02.037
Get him!

1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:04.206
Up there, up there.

1:08:04.289 --> 1:08:06.041
Come on, come on!

1:08:06.124 --> 1:08:07.626
Come back here!

1:08:07.709 --> 1:08:08.710
Hey!

1:08:12.172 --> 1:08:14.007
(tires squealing)

1:08:18.261 --> 1:08:19.888
Melissa.

1:08:19.971 --> 1:08:21.056
Where have you been?

1:08:21.139 --> 1:08:22.307
We've been looking for you.

1:08:22.391 --> 1:08:25.227
He wants Anthony and
whatever Dr. Lloyd wants.

1:08:26.478 --> 1:08:27.771
He wants him alive.

1:08:29.356 --> 1:08:30.524
Give me the gun.

1:08:34.277 --> 1:08:35.362
What are you doing?

1:08:36.571 --> 1:08:37.739
Dr. Lloyd's bidding.

1:08:38.699 --> 1:08:39.866
Why?

1:08:39.950 --> 1:08:41.451
He's the only doctor
who's been willing

1:08:41.535 --> 1:08:42.786
to treat my illness.

1:08:43.495 --> 1:08:44.663
Ambition.

1:08:44.746 --> 1:08:47.541
Even more fatal than now, I'm afraid.

1:08:47.624 --> 1:08:49.835
I contracted it
handling hemocyanin.

1:08:49.918 --> 1:08:53.463
He's made it less painful
and has given me hope.

1:08:54.631 --> 1:08:59.344
- (crashing)
- (screaming)

1:09:02.848 --> 1:09:04.766
- It won't let go!
- Hold on.

1:09:07.102 --> 1:09:09.020
Get something!

1:09:09.104 --> 1:09:11.523
(screaming)

1:09:13.316 --> 1:09:14.443
All right.

1:09:17.112 --> 1:09:18.113
Pull it.

1:09:18.739 --> 1:09:21.158
(screaming)

1:09:26.913 --> 1:09:27.914
You got her?
Got her?

1:09:31.084 --> 1:09:33.587
(all chatter indistinctly)

1:09:38.592 --> 1:09:39.843
Melissa.

1:09:41.011 --> 1:09:42.262
Oh, my God, she's cold.

1:09:42.345 --> 1:09:44.931
Melissa, hold on.
We'll get you to a hospital.

1:09:45.015 --> 1:09:47.726
No, only Dr. Lloyd can help.

1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:50.604
It's too late now even for him.

1:09:50.687 --> 1:09:53.231
John, the Anthony
journals are hidden

1:09:53.315 --> 1:09:54.900
behind the laundry room.

1:09:56.109 --> 1:09:57.569
They belong to you.

1:09:59.654 --> 1:10:01.948
Your mother was my hero.

1:10:02.032 --> 1:10:03.241
Melissa!

1:10:03.325 --> 1:10:05.035
(Melissa screaming)

1:10:08.038 --> 1:10:10.749
- Oh no, God!
- No!

1:10:16.963 --> 1:10:18.381
JOHN: Melissa!

1:10:19.549 --> 1:10:20.675
John!

1:10:20.759 --> 1:10:22.761
(screaming)

1:10:25.138 --> 1:10:26.306
Do something!

1:10:26.389 --> 1:10:27.641
We've gotta do something!

1:10:29.643 --> 1:10:30.685
Oh, Jesus.

1:10:33.563 --> 1:10:35.774
(screaming)

1:10:39.277 --> 1:10:41.238
What the fuck is happening?

1:10:42.155 --> 1:10:44.699
(screaming)

1:10:47.410 --> 1:10:48.578
No!

1:10:59.673 --> 1:11:02.467
(dramatic music)

1:11:02.551 --> 1:11:03.510
Brad!

1:11:03.593 --> 1:11:05.720
(screaming)

1:11:09.057 --> 1:11:11.935
CINDY: Get him!
Get him!

1:11:15.522 --> 1:11:17.357
Help me get him out of here.

1:11:23.446 --> 1:11:24.990
Brad! Hold on!

1:11:27.158 --> 1:11:29.160
Yeah, put it on there.

1:11:33.707 --> 1:11:35.333
It's off, come on, let's go.

1:11:35.417 --> 1:11:37.711
Let's go, everybody
out, come on.

1:11:38.920 --> 1:11:40.589
Go, go, go.

1:11:40.672 --> 1:11:43.759
Take care of Brad's leg. I'm going to go
downstairs and check the doors.

1:11:54.477 --> 1:11:56.396
- No, go back upstairs.
- Please, I want to help.

1:11:56.479 --> 1:11:58.231
- I want to help you.
- No, it's too dangerous down here.

1:11:58.315 --> 1:12:00.233
It's dangerous everywhere, John.

1:12:02.360 --> 1:12:03.820
(rumbling)

1:12:15.707 --> 1:12:16.707
John?

1:12:18.668 --> 1:12:19.668
Sharon!

1:12:22.631 --> 1:12:23.631
Sharon!

1:12:27.010 --> 1:12:28.803
John, John!

1:12:28.887 --> 1:12:30.055
JOHN: Can you hear me?

1:12:30.138 --> 1:12:32.182
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right!

1:12:35.477 --> 1:12:36.728
I'm all right.

1:12:37.729 --> 1:12:39.814
I can't see.

1:12:39.898 --> 1:12:41.316
JOHN: Hang on, we'll
get you out of there.

1:12:41.399 --> 1:12:42.399
John?

1:12:43.193 --> 1:12:44.235
Sharon!

1:12:45.528 --> 1:12:47.739
Here, tie that up to that pole.

1:12:49.532 --> 1:12:50.617
Grab the rope.

1:12:50.700 --> 1:12:52.494
- Hurry!
- We'll pull you up.

1:12:52.577 --> 1:12:54.287
- Stay calm.
- Hang on, we're coming!

1:12:55.372 --> 1:12:56.456
Stay back.

1:13:01.628 --> 1:13:02.879
CINDY: Can you see it?

1:13:04.589 --> 1:13:06.508
- You got it?
- Okay!

1:13:06.591 --> 1:13:08.426
John?

1:13:09.594 --> 1:13:10.887
All right.

1:13:10.971 --> 1:13:12.362
Here we...
All right, we got you.

1:13:13.390 --> 1:13:15.433
Hold onto the rope!

1:13:15.517 --> 1:13:16.559
Hold tight.

1:13:17.519 --> 1:13:18.561
That's it.

1:13:21.731 --> 1:13:23.441
- It's coming!
- Yeah, okay!

1:13:23.525 --> 1:13:24.859
It's all clear!

1:13:26.611 --> 1:13:28.446
CINDY: Okay, we got you.

1:13:28.530 --> 1:13:30.073
(Sharon screams)

1:13:30.156 --> 1:13:31.324
Sharon!

1:13:32.534 --> 1:13:33.576
Sharon!

1:13:37.497 --> 1:13:38.790
Are you okay?

1:13:39.582 --> 1:13:40.917
I think so!

1:13:42.836 --> 1:13:44.004
JOHN: I'm coming down.

1:13:44.087 --> 1:13:45.505
Hold tight, I'll be right there.

1:13:45.588 --> 1:13:47.215
Okay, hurry.

1:14:07.402 --> 1:14:08.778
Oh, God.

1:14:13.283 --> 1:14:16.202
(thunder crashing)

1:14:24.044 --> 1:14:26.546
(ominous music)

1:14:37.682 --> 1:14:39.142
(roaring)

1:14:41.436 --> 1:14:42.436
(Sharon gasps)

1:14:43.730 --> 1:14:46.733
(Sharon screams)

1:14:49.986 --> 1:14:51.863
John!

1:14:51.946 --> 1:14:53.114
(gun firing)

1:14:59.037 --> 1:15:00.914
Sharon, come on, come on.

1:15:04.834 --> 1:15:07.087
Here, here, get back in here.

1:15:08.671 --> 1:15:09.671
Yeah.

1:15:30.318 --> 1:15:31.318
Hart!

1:15:33.446 --> 1:15:34.614
BRAD: Hart.

1:15:34.697 --> 1:15:37.367
John and Sharon,
they're down there.

1:15:42.455 --> 1:15:44.374
John, in here.

1:15:48.086 --> 1:15:49.295
Be careful.

1:15:51.589 --> 1:15:53.508
I think this is part
of the laundry chute.

1:15:53.591 --> 1:15:54.884
We can climb up.

1:15:55.677 --> 1:15:57.512
(screams)

1:15:59.055 --> 1:16:00.055
Brad!

1:16:02.308 --> 1:16:04.185
No, hold on.

1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:07.939
(screaming)

1:16:08.773 --> 1:16:10.692
- Grab my hand!
- Hold on!

1:16:10.775 --> 1:16:11.775
Grab hold of my hand!

1:16:12.610 --> 1:16:13.610
Okay.

1:16:14.028 --> 1:16:15.738
Don't let go, I got you.

1:16:17.282 --> 1:16:19.159
I got you, just pull.

1:16:19.784 --> 1:16:23.329
Cindy. Calm down, calm down,
honey, hold onto me.

1:16:26.916 --> 1:16:27.917
Grab my hand!

1:16:28.293 --> 1:16:30.837
(Cindy screams)

1:16:32.380 --> 1:16:33.506
Cindy!

1:16:34.507 --> 1:16:35.508
Cindy!

1:16:36.634 --> 1:16:38.720
(crying)

1:16:41.556 --> 1:16:42.724
She's gone!

1:17:16.299 --> 1:17:18.468
(screaming)

1:17:21.846 --> 1:17:23.014
Oh, God!

1:17:24.682 --> 1:17:26.684
Hold on, we'll get it!

1:17:33.566 --> 1:17:35.740
- SHARON: What are we gonna do?
- I've got an idea.

1:17:43.076 --> 1:17:45.536
(gentle music)

1:17:49.916 --> 1:17:52.502
(screaming)

1:17:56.256 --> 1:17:57.715
Come on!

1:18:00.343 --> 1:18:01.427
(lullaby plays)

1:18:01.511 --> 1:18:03.846
Sharon, you've got to stay
here and keep the tape running.

1:18:03.930 --> 1:18:06.349
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You want me to play it back...

1:18:06.432 --> 1:18:08.101
Please just keep
the tape running.

1:18:09.519 --> 1:18:10.603
I'll be back.

1:18:20.071 --> 1:18:21.823
Hart, what are you doing here?

1:18:21.906 --> 1:18:23.825
Cindy's down there.

1:18:24.742 --> 1:18:25.743
JOHN: What's that for?

1:18:25.827 --> 1:18:27.453
I'm going down after her.

1:18:27.537 --> 1:18:29.038
Nobody's going down there.

1:18:29.122 --> 1:18:30.832
She needs help.

1:18:30.915 --> 1:18:32.041
The only way we're
going to get to her is

1:18:32.125 --> 1:18:33.501
to kill that thing first.

1:18:34.460 --> 1:18:35.628
How?

1:18:35.712 --> 1:18:37.338
BRAD: Wait a second.

1:18:37.422 --> 1:18:38.798
I got it.

1:18:38.881 --> 1:18:43.011
Let's give that freak of
nature a little surprise.

1:18:45.680 --> 1:18:48.308
(ominous music)

1:19:09.287 --> 1:19:10.330
Sharon.

1:19:10.413 --> 1:19:12.832
<i>Power's going to go off
for a couple of seconds.</i>

1:19:12.915 --> 1:19:14.250
Now when it comes back on,

1:19:14.334 --> 1:19:16.552
- you turn the music off, all right?
- SHARON: <i>Okay.</i>

1:19:17.462 --> 1:19:18.588
It's off.

1:19:26.637 --> 1:19:28.973
Hold it!
Hold it, don't you move.

1:19:29.057 --> 1:19:30.850
What are you doing here?

1:19:30.933 --> 1:19:33.811
I've come to collect
my legacy from Amanda.

1:19:34.687 --> 1:19:36.064
He belongs to me.

1:19:37.065 --> 1:19:38.358
Not alive.

1:19:38.983 --> 1:19:40.234
You don't get him alive.

1:19:40.318 --> 1:19:41.819
I get it alive, you understand?

1:19:41.903 --> 1:19:44.947
Alive or over your dead body,
is that understood?

1:19:45.031 --> 1:19:47.283
It killed Melissa.

1:19:48.576 --> 1:19:51.037
Well, Melissa didn't
have long to live anyway.

1:19:52.038 --> 1:19:54.582
Now let's go into
the house, shall we?

1:19:54.665 --> 1:19:56.751
Get in the house, I said!

1:20:07.595 --> 1:20:10.306
(dramatic music)

1:20:13.226 --> 1:20:14.226
Here!

1:20:15.395 --> 1:20:16.687
Take the wire.

1:20:16.771 --> 1:20:17.897
No, what are you doing?

1:20:17.980 --> 1:20:19.285
They're trying to destroy him.

1:20:23.444 --> 1:20:25.947
You call yourself a scientist?
A brilliant scientist?

1:20:26.030 --> 1:20:28.199
Turn the goddamn power on.

1:20:29.492 --> 1:20:30.576
Don't you do it!

1:20:31.577 --> 1:20:32.995
Stop that, by God!

1:20:37.583 --> 1:20:39.710
You can't do this, John,
your mother created it.

1:20:40.545 --> 1:20:42.505
Don't you do it, no you don't!

1:20:42.588 --> 1:20:44.090
- Shit.
- Leave it alone, come out of there!

1:20:44.173 --> 1:20:45.299
I need something.

1:20:45.383 --> 1:20:47.593
And you, you trying to
destroy your brother.

1:20:47.677 --> 1:20:49.429
- That's not my brother.
- You listen to me.

1:20:49.512 --> 1:20:51.180
That's your brother,
do you understand that?

1:20:51.264 --> 1:20:52.890
It was a mistake!

1:20:52.974 --> 1:20:55.852
My mother knew it,
she sent me here to destroy it.

1:20:57.061 --> 1:20:57.937
You can't destroy it.

1:20:58.020 --> 1:20:59.605
It was created from your own body,

1:20:59.689 --> 1:21:01.566
your mother intended
it that way.

1:21:01.649 --> 1:21:04.527
That's why she called
it your brother.

1:21:04.610 --> 1:21:06.154
You're part of it, John.

1:21:06.237 --> 1:21:09.031
It's part of your heart,
part of your mind, part of your soul.

1:21:09.115 --> 1:21:12.118
He's part of your imagination,
you understand?

1:21:16.164 --> 1:21:17.498
Fry the son of a bitch!

1:21:17.582 --> 1:21:18.833
- No!
- Brad!

1:21:21.836 --> 1:21:23.629
- Brad, do it!
- No!

1:21:26.048 --> 1:21:27.133
(popping)

1:21:57.121 --> 1:21:58.121
Anthony!

1:22:46.170 --> 1:22:47.421
Anthony!

1:22:55.888 --> 1:22:58.182
Oh, my God!

1:23:02.061 --> 1:23:04.480
(screaming)

1:23:04.564 --> 1:23:09.193
No!

1:23:50.276 --> 1:23:51.819
Thought I'd give it another try.

1:23:53.237 --> 1:23:54.322
I couldn't find her.

1:23:55.823 --> 1:23:57.783
I think I got all the journals.

1:23:57.867 --> 1:24:00.328
Did you get the journals
in the laundry room?

1:24:01.287 --> 1:24:02.872
The ones that Melissa found.

1:24:03.497 --> 1:24:04.457
I'll get 'em.

1:24:04.540 --> 1:24:06.000
I'll meet you in the car?

1:24:35.738 --> 1:24:37.031
What a mess.

1:24:38.866 --> 1:24:40.117
Where's Hart?

1:24:40.201 --> 1:24:41.452
Oh, he's in the ambulance.

1:24:42.161 --> 1:24:43.496
Bleeding stopped.

1:24:44.455 --> 1:24:49.293
He just can't believe
that Cindy's gone.

1:24:51.879 --> 1:24:53.130
I'll go talk to him.

1:25:02.640 --> 1:25:05.309
(animals crying)

1:25:11.524 --> 1:25:12.525
No.

1:25:17.988 --> 1:25:20.032
(water gurgling)

1:25:32.962 --> 1:25:35.297
(Sharon screaming)

1:25:35.381 --> 1:25:36.381
Sharon!

1:25:55.151 --> 1:25:56.151
(groans)

1:26:07.538 --> 1:26:08.789
(coughs)

1:26:21.635 --> 1:26:24.096
Matches, matches, matches.

1:26:25.973 --> 1:26:27.099
Damn!

1:26:32.229 --> 1:26:33.230
Come on.

1:26:35.357 --> 1:26:36.358
Magnesium.

1:26:37.234 --> 1:26:38.319
We're gonna have
to get out of here.

1:26:38.402 --> 1:26:40.529
- HART: Here you go.
- Thanks, Hart.

1:26:40.613 --> 1:26:41.781
I'm going to go back in
and I'm going to get Brad.

1:26:41.864 --> 1:26:43.783
- Are you all right?
- Yes, yes.

1:26:45.993 --> 1:26:48.329
(clanging)

1:27:01.091 --> 1:27:02.718
Okay, yeah.

1:27:08.891 --> 1:27:10.559
Brad!

1:27:10.643 --> 1:27:11.643
Brad!

1:27:20.528 --> 1:27:21.987
Don't fail me now.

1:27:26.242 --> 1:27:27.284
All right.

1:27:34.333 --> 1:27:36.252
You little bastards are history.

1:27:43.509 --> 1:27:46.095
(Cindy gasping)

1:27:49.765 --> 1:27:50.766
Cindy!

1:27:51.684 --> 1:27:52.852
Cindy.

1:27:53.686 --> 1:27:56.856
That's it, come on,
you can do it, come on.

1:27:57.648 --> 1:27:59.400
Good, good.

1:27:59.483 --> 1:28:01.443
CINDY: I was hiding and...

1:28:02.945 --> 1:28:05.906
John, Sharon, Hart!

1:28:06.740 --> 1:28:07.575
HART: What?

1:28:07.658 --> 1:28:08.784
Where the hell is John?

1:28:08.868 --> 1:28:10.494
He went in looking for you.

1:28:11.829 --> 1:28:12.913
No!

1:28:20.546 --> 1:28:21.839
John!

1:28:29.597 --> 1:28:32.266
- The house is gonna blow up, get out!
- What?

1:28:33.183 --> 1:28:34.268
Cindy.

1:28:34.351 --> 1:28:35.769
Get out!

1:28:35.853 --> 1:28:38.272
The basement is infested
with the little bastards!

1:28:41.317 --> 1:28:42.317
Let's go.

1:28:44.445 --> 1:28:45.821
(screaming)

1:28:47.072 --> 1:28:48.072
Get in!

1:28:48.699 --> 1:28:49.699
Open the door.

1:28:52.578 --> 1:28:53.578
Cindy!

1:28:55.122 --> 1:28:56.123
Get inside.

1:29:02.922 --> 1:29:06.133
(creatures crying)

1:29:09.720 --> 1:29:11.513
(calm music)

1:29:37.122 --> 1:29:39.625
(lullaby music)

1:29:56.308 --> 1:29:59.311
(gentle music)
