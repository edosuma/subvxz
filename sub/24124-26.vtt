WEBVTT

00:00.125 --> 00:03.125
I gotta get goin'

00:03.125 --> 00:06.583
a friend of mine

00:08.291 --> 00:11.250
he's just Pooh Bear

00:13.875 --> 00:17.333
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.333 --> 00:20.750
I know he's out there

00:24.583 --> 00:28.000
we're so adventurous

00:28.000 --> 00:31.375
and again

00:31.375 --> 00:34.875
and there's nobody home

00:34.875 --> 00:38.291
to count on a friend

00:38.291 --> 00:41.833
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.750 --> 00:45.333
take me, please?

00:45.333 --> 00:48.750
I gotta be there

00:50.625 --> 00:55.291
Winnie the Pooh

01:19.708 --> 01:22.125
Now, throw in your penny,
Piglet,

01:22.125 --> 01:24.708
and ask the wishing well
for a wish.

01:25.458 --> 01:28.166
I wish I had...

01:28.166 --> 01:29.375
a penny.

01:29.375 --> 01:32.166
But wasn't that a penny,
Piglet?

01:33.166 --> 01:34.333
Ohh.

01:34.333 --> 01:36.708
Oh, d-d-d-dear.

01:36.708 --> 01:38.583
Let me see.

01:38.583 --> 01:40.375
I'll wish for a rake.

01:40.375 --> 01:41.500
Uh, no, a shovel.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.000
No. A short winter.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.583
I mean, an early spring.

01:44.583 --> 01:48.833
Probably be summer
before he makes up his mind.

01:48.833 --> 01:51.416
I've got it!
I wish for--

01:51.416 --> 01:53.458
Hiya, Rabbit!

01:53.458 --> 01:56.708
Tigger, I wish you'd
stop bouncing me.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.416
Now look what you've done.

02:05.416 --> 02:07.083
I wasted my wish.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.583
Well, sorry, fluff face.

02:08.583 --> 02:11.083
Guess that makes it
my turn.

02:11.083 --> 02:15.000
Wish I wasn't so gloomy
all the time.

02:17.291 --> 02:19.708
Now there's a gloomy sight.

02:21.083 --> 02:25.708
I wish my birthday
would come more often.

02:25.708 --> 02:30.000
Perhaps seven or
eight times a year.
Please.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.291
Would make for an
awfully old Pooh Bear.

02:33.291 --> 02:35.291
Yes.

02:35.291 --> 02:37.958
But just think of
all the birthday parties,

02:37.958 --> 02:40.333
and all the
birthday presents.

02:40.333 --> 02:41.625
Honey.

02:41.625 --> 02:44.000
Honey!

02:44.000 --> 02:45.750
And more honey.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.416
My favorite part is
blowing out the candles,

02:48.416 --> 02:50.291
and making a wish.

02:50.291 --> 02:52.250
Oh, I've made
lots of wishes,

02:52.250 --> 02:54.000
and none of them
ever came true.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.416
Must have been using
defective pennies.

02:56.416 --> 03:00.250
But birthday wishes
always come true.

03:00.250 --> 03:01.958
I always wish for honey.

03:01.958 --> 03:03.625
And I always get it.

03:03.625 --> 03:06.458
Really?
You don't say?

03:06.458 --> 03:10.000
Uh, where can I get
some of them birthydays?

03:10.000 --> 03:13.250
Why, you get one
the moment you're born.

03:13.250 --> 03:15.625
Everyone has a birthday,

03:15.625 --> 03:17.125
even tiggers.

03:17.125 --> 03:19.458
Uh, you were born,
weren't you?

03:19.458 --> 03:21.000
I ain't sure.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.708
I don't think I was around
when it happened.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.375
What if I was born
on some day

03:26.375 --> 03:27.875
other than my birthday?

03:27.875 --> 03:29.875
Poor Tigger.

03:29.875 --> 03:31.458
No birthday.

03:31.458 --> 03:33.458
And no birthday wishes.

03:33.458 --> 03:36.166
Yeah.
Poor Tigger.

03:36.166 --> 03:38.750
I never realized
what I was missin'--

03:38.750 --> 03:42.125
Bein' birthday-less.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.500
Oh, dear.

03:45.500 --> 03:48.000
Why don't we just
give Tigger a birthday?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.875
A birthday?

03:49.875 --> 03:51.375
For me?

03:51.375 --> 03:53.708
What a fantastical idea!

03:53.708 --> 03:56.875
Can today be my birthday?
Can it? Huh? Huh? Can it?

03:56.875 --> 03:58.250
Uh, today?

03:58.250 --> 03:59.708
Uh, well, uh--

03:59.708 --> 04:02.208
Can I have a party tonight?
Please? Can I?

04:02.208 --> 04:03.875
Huh? Huh? Can I?

04:03.875 --> 04:07.000
- Uh, now, Tigger--
- Oh, thanks, guys.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.500
My very firstest birthday.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.125
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

04:12.125 --> 04:14.000
Well, I got a lot of
wishing to practice

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
before the party.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.625
Uh, TTFN.
Ta-ta for now.

04:19.166 --> 04:21.000
Maybe I'll wish for
a bouncing ball,

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
or a jumping Jack,
or a jumping Jill.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.166
A rocket ship,
and a couple of dozen
banana splits.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.875
And a pogo stick
and...

04:27.875 --> 04:29.416
All: Oh, bother.

04:29.416 --> 04:33.166
Uh, since today's
Tigger's birthday,

04:33.166 --> 04:36.000
somebody had better
start thinking of
what to give him.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.458
But thinking is always
so difficult.

04:39.458 --> 04:41.875
I think I have an idea.

04:41.875 --> 04:42.958
I hope.

04:45.833 --> 04:48.333
Rabbit: Now, what kind of
present is that?

04:48.333 --> 04:50.125
A Tigger preserver.

04:50.125 --> 04:52.416
In case he
accidentally bounces
into a lake.

04:52.416 --> 04:56.083
All he has to do is
pull this cord.

04:56.083 --> 04:58.500
Oh, d-d-d-d-dear.

05:03.708 --> 05:06.583
Yee-oww!

05:06.583 --> 05:09.875
Oh, Piglet's gift
looks like such fun.

05:09.875 --> 05:13.000
How shall I ever find
anything half so wonderful?

05:13.000 --> 05:14.583
Yee-oww!

05:14.583 --> 05:17.708
Doesn't matter what you give.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.958
It's the thought that counts.

05:21.875 --> 05:25.458
Ha! I've got something
twice as good as that.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.458
Pooh: Why, Rabbit.

05:29.458 --> 05:32.125
That's the most wonderful
birthday present

05:32.125 --> 05:34.166
I've ever seen.

05:34.166 --> 05:36.166
Oh... what is it?

05:36.166 --> 05:37.458
Silly old bear.

05:37.458 --> 05:39.125
It's a tigger suit.

05:39.125 --> 05:43.000
And wait 'til you see
how bouncy the tail is.

05:44.875 --> 05:47.458
See?

05:47.458 --> 05:52.458
Rabbit, perhaps this tail
needs an ounce more bounce.

05:52.458 --> 05:55.875
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It works perfectly.

05:55.875 --> 05:58.250
The less Tigger bounces
the better.

05:59.750 --> 06:02.083
Another wonderful gift

06:02.083 --> 06:04.583
I'll never be able
to give Tigger.

06:10.875 --> 06:12.166
Oh, bother.

06:12.166 --> 06:14.000
Think, think, think.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.583
Think, think, think.

06:16.583 --> 06:20.583
Tigger: Happy birthday
to me!

06:20.583 --> 06:22.166
I'm gonna wish for
a trampoline,

06:22.166 --> 06:23.291
a flyin' machine,

06:23.291 --> 06:26.333
a banana split,
a pogo stick.

06:26.333 --> 06:28.333
Uh, make that
two pogo sticks.

06:28.333 --> 06:29.458
One for each foot,
you know.

06:29.458 --> 06:30.458
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Oh, hiya, guys.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.125
Gettin' ready for
my party?

06:38.125 --> 06:41.375
Tigger, I'm afraid
your cake tastes like...

06:41.375 --> 06:42.458
mud.

06:42.458 --> 06:44.333
It is mud, buddy bear.

06:44.333 --> 06:45.708
I'm rehearsing
my wishes.

06:45.708 --> 06:47.875
After missing
so many birthdays,

06:47.875 --> 06:50.291
I gotta make
a zillion wishes
just to catch up.

06:50.291 --> 06:52.458
Gonna wish for
a hundred thingamabobs.

06:52.458 --> 06:54.416
and eleventy-seventy
clumpity tops.

06:54.416 --> 06:55.958
And an elevator,
an enervator,

06:55.958 --> 06:58.416
an X, a Y,
and a zebrarator.

06:58.416 --> 07:01.000
Next thing, he'll
wish for the moon.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.416
Yeah, the moon.

07:02.416 --> 07:04.000
I could use
one of them, too,

07:04.000 --> 07:05.208
maybe as a night light.

07:07.333 --> 07:09.708
What do you give a tigger
who has nothing,

07:09.708 --> 07:11.375
but wants everything?

07:11.375 --> 07:13.375
Now, where was I?
Oh, yeah.

07:13.375 --> 07:15.708
Banana splits
and pogo sticks.

07:15.708 --> 07:17.833
And submarines
and lima beans,

07:17.833 --> 07:20.250
and-- Yeek!
Lima beans!

07:20.250 --> 07:21.875
Yee-ee-yuck!

07:21.875 --> 07:24.000
I'll take it,
it's my birthday.

07:25.250 --> 07:27.166
A music box
and a pair of socks.

07:27.166 --> 07:29.208
A bicycle bell
and a carousel.

07:29.208 --> 07:31.708
Pint of custard
and hold the mustard.

07:34.083 --> 07:35.833
Rabbit: Happy birthday,
Tigger.

07:35.833 --> 07:37.333
Piglet: Happy birthday!

07:37.333 --> 07:39.958
Pooh: Yes.
And many more.

07:39.958 --> 07:42.708
Happy birthday to me!

07:42.708 --> 07:44.250
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

07:44.250 --> 07:47.708
Now, make a wish, Tigger,
and blow out the candle.

07:47.708 --> 07:50.125
Thanks, Rabbit.

07:50.125 --> 07:51.875
I wish for--

07:51.875 --> 07:54.125
I wish for--

07:54.125 --> 07:56.000
Uh, got it all here now.
A couple of these,

07:56.000 --> 07:57.583
and some of those.

07:57.583 --> 07:59.375
Oh, yeah, yeah,
don't want to forget
these here.

08:01.458 --> 08:03.750
what difference does it make?

08:03.750 --> 08:05.875
I wish for...

08:05.875 --> 08:06.875
everything!

08:13.250 --> 08:16.208
Uh, but, uh, enough of
the festivities.

08:16.208 --> 08:17.958
Let's get down to
the important stuff

08:17.958 --> 08:20.416
where I open my presents
and get my wishes.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.708
A wonderful idea.

08:22.708 --> 08:25.583
Oh, thanks, Piglet.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.458
Just what I always wanted.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.750
Oh-ho!
Thanks, Rabbit.

08:29.750 --> 08:32.166
Just what I always wanted.

08:33.958 --> 08:36.416
Ha-ha!
Thanks, Pooh boy.

08:36.416 --> 08:37.750
Just what I always wanted.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.875
Pooh,
your present's empty.

08:40.875 --> 08:42.416
Yes, Piglet.

08:42.416 --> 08:44.625
I couldn't think of
what to get Tigger.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.458
I'd rather hoped he'd
look at the box and say,

08:47.458 --> 08:50.583
"My, it looks too pretty
to unwrap."

08:50.583 --> 08:52.708
And then he wouldn't.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.833
Couldn't think of
what to get ya,

08:56.833 --> 08:58.875
so I got ya me.

08:58.875 --> 09:01.458
Thanks, Eeyore.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.250
Just what I always wanted.

09:06.291 --> 09:07.625
This is great,
but, uh,

09:07.625 --> 09:09.458
where's all the stuff
I wished for?

09:09.458 --> 09:11.958
My banana split?
My pogo stick?

09:11.958 --> 09:14.375
Uh, Tigger, uh,

09:14.375 --> 09:16.833
I'm afraid there are
no more presents.

09:16.833 --> 09:20.583
But, uh, aren't my wishes
supposed to come true?

09:20.583 --> 09:24.458
Uh, well, uh,
you see, uh--

09:24.458 --> 09:26.458
Did I do something wrong?

09:26.458 --> 09:28.625
Didn't I blow out my candle?

09:28.625 --> 09:30.708
Isn't this my birthday?

09:30.708 --> 09:32.708
Why, of course it is.

09:32.708 --> 09:35.125
I mean, uh,
we think it is.

09:35.125 --> 09:38.000
Now, of course,
we're not completely sure,
but uh--

09:38.000 --> 09:40.375
Maybe I was right.

09:40.375 --> 09:42.750
Maybe I haven't got
a birthday.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.000
Maybe I wasn't around
when I was born.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.875
Maybe I wasn't born at all.

09:47.875 --> 09:50.083
Oh, d-d-dear.

09:50.083 --> 09:51.625
And I thought
we could give Tigger

09:51.625 --> 09:54.000
a birthday
he'd never forget.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.375
Afraid we did just that.

09:56.375 --> 09:59.625
Perhaps if I had given him
a better gift.

09:59.625 --> 10:01.166
It wouldn't have helped.

10:01.166 --> 10:04.083
If only he hadn't wanted
so many things.

10:04.083 --> 10:06.875
Banana splits
and pogo sticks.

10:06.875 --> 10:09.625
He may as well have
wished for the moon.

10:09.625 --> 10:12.000
Wanted that, too.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.125
Why, so he did.

10:15.125 --> 10:16.375
Pooh,
where are you going?

10:16.375 --> 10:18.875
To save Tigger's birthday.

10:18.875 --> 10:21.625
If the moon will
make Tigger happy,

10:21.625 --> 10:23.708
then that's just what
I'll get him.

10:25.708 --> 10:28.708
Hello up there!

10:28.708 --> 10:31.375
It's very nice meeting you.

10:31.375 --> 10:35.708
Uh, perhaps you'd
like to come down
for a visit,

10:35.708 --> 10:39.583
uh, to meet my
very dear friend Tigger.

10:39.583 --> 10:42.583
Perhaps not.

10:42.583 --> 10:46.416
Moons are certainly good
at hiding.

10:46.416 --> 10:48.875
Especially for being so big.

10:48.875 --> 10:50.958
And bright.

10:50.958 --> 10:53.708
I wish he'd come down.

10:55.375 --> 10:58.000
There you are.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.583
Perhaps you're hungry
and dropped by

11:00.583 --> 11:03.125
for a smackerel of honey?

11:04.416 --> 11:06.625
How silly of me.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.833
You're a full moon.

11:08.833 --> 11:10.875
But if you get hungry,

11:10.875 --> 11:12.708
there are good things to eat

11:12.708 --> 11:16.458
at a certain birthday party
I know of.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.708
Just jump in my net,

11:18.708 --> 11:21.583
and I'll take you there.

11:21.583 --> 11:22.708
Oh, bother.

11:28.291 --> 11:30.625
Oh, bother, bother.

11:41.708 --> 11:45.208
Oh, my.
Another bother.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.416
Ohh-ho-ho!

11:53.291 --> 11:57.000
I suppose
this is what comes of
wishing for the moon.

12:04.125 --> 12:06.458
Oh, my. It's--

12:06.458 --> 12:08.583
It's--
It's Pooh's hat.

12:08.583 --> 12:11.000
Yeah, but he's not
inside it.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.875
Oh, d-d-d-dear.

12:12.875 --> 12:14.208
He must have fallen in.

12:14.208 --> 12:16.625
If I'd have got
the ladder I wished for,

12:16.625 --> 12:17.750
it would be a cinch.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.291
He could just climb out.

12:19.291 --> 12:21.708
And if it weren't for
your silly wishes,

12:21.708 --> 12:23.958
he wouldn't be down there
in the first place.

12:23.958 --> 12:26.750
My wishes?
Hey, that's it!

12:26.750 --> 12:28.208
Buddy bear
must be gettin' me

12:28.208 --> 12:31.208
a real fantastical gift
down there.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.958
Hang on, Pooh boy!

12:36.333 --> 12:38.250
He's down there,
all right.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.333
I'd recognize
my buddy's voice anywhere.

12:40.333 --> 12:43.833
Tigger:
We're comin' to get ya!

12:43.833 --> 12:46.708
Oh, bother.
I can't let Tigger find me.

12:46.708 --> 12:49.708
Not without a gift
for his birthday.

12:49.708 --> 12:54.500
But where could the moon be
when there is no sky?

12:54.500 --> 12:57.416
For that matter,
where am I?

13:00.458 --> 13:02.875
Now remember,
two ringy-dingys means

13:02.875 --> 13:04.166
- lower us down.
-

13:04.166 --> 13:07.958
And three ringy-dingys
means stop.

13:07.958 --> 13:10.000
Four ringy-dingys
means lunch time,

13:10.000 --> 13:11.708
send down some icy cream,
and--

13:14.125 --> 13:15.958
What does that mean?

13:15.958 --> 13:18.583
It means don't let go!

13:31.875 --> 13:35.583
Uh, this doesn't look like
your average

13:35.583 --> 13:37.500
bottom of a well.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.708
Ooh!

13:39.708 --> 13:42.000
Where are we?

13:43.083 --> 13:44.458
I wish I knew.

14:00.333 --> 14:02.125
Tigger: Wishland?

14:02.125 --> 14:04.708
Ha! There's no such thing
as wishes.

14:04.708 --> 14:07.125
After my birthday party,
I should know.

14:07.125 --> 14:08.833
Are you sure?

14:08.833 --> 14:10.958
Sure, I'm sure.
I'll prove it.

14:10.958 --> 14:12.333
Rabbit,
make a wish.

14:12.333 --> 14:15.166
Hmm, I wish for a--

14:15.166 --> 14:17.166
a year's supply of carrots.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.250
See?

14:20.250 --> 14:24.125
I wish for
a bushel of acorns?

14:25.875 --> 14:27.083
What'd I tell ya?

14:27.083 --> 14:28.708
I'll show you
how dumb this is.

14:28.708 --> 14:30.875
I wish I had a peanut butter
and Jell-O sandwich.

14:30.875 --> 14:33.166
And a root beer
to wash it down with.

14:38.875 --> 14:40.500
Did you see that?

14:40.500 --> 14:42.958
Ooh, it looks real.

14:43.958 --> 14:45.958
It is real.

14:45.958 --> 14:47.458
Ha-ha! Hoo-hoo-hoo!

14:47.458 --> 14:49.833
Birthday wishes
do come true.

14:49.833 --> 14:51.958
Now I wish for
a root beer for Piglet,

14:51.958 --> 14:53.458
and one for you.

14:53.458 --> 14:55.625
Wonderful.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.958
- Both: Happy birthday,
Tigger.

14:59.958 --> 15:03.125
- Yeah, happy birthday,
Tigger.

15:03.125 --> 15:04.583
I'm gonna wish for
a bouncin' ball,

15:04.583 --> 15:06.000
and some flappity jacks,

15:06.000 --> 15:09.125
and a couple of dozen
clickity clacks.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.250
And a submarine in
a sea of green,

15:11.250 --> 15:13.583
and some whatchamacallits
I ain't never seen.

15:13.583 --> 15:16.583
- Uh, Tigger, wait.
- And some--

15:16.583 --> 15:18.000
Hey, what's the matter?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.833
I was just gettin' to
the good stuff,

15:19.833 --> 15:22.083
like banana splits
and pogo sticks.

15:22.083 --> 15:24.875
We-- we forgot about Pooh.

15:24.875 --> 15:26.708
Oh, Pooh Bear.

15:26.708 --> 15:29.625
Don't worry,
Piglet, old pal.

15:29.625 --> 15:32.000
Buddy bear's gonna have
the time of his life,

15:32.000 --> 15:33.708
'cause I'm wishin' him

15:33.708 --> 15:36.208
all of the honey
he's ever dreamed of.

15:37.875 --> 15:39.875
Honey!

15:39.875 --> 15:43.000
Tigger: And a great big pot
to put it in.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.458
Oh-oh-oh-ohhh!

15:47.458 --> 15:49.291
Piglet: I'm sure Pooh
appreciates that, Tigger,

15:49.291 --> 15:51.000
wherever he is,

15:51.000 --> 15:52.708
but don't you think
if he were here--

15:52.708 --> 15:54.000
And for you, Piglet,

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
a gazillion bushels
of acorns!

15:58.458 --> 16:01.000
Oh, d-d-d-dear.

16:06.708 --> 16:09.500
Uh, Tigger, that's
very nice of you, but--

16:09.500 --> 16:11.875
Now, now,
I didn't forget you,
long ears.

16:11.875 --> 16:13.708
A year's worth of carrots.

16:13.708 --> 16:15.583
No, a hundred!

16:15.583 --> 16:16.750
Tigger.

16:16.750 --> 16:19.875
Okay, then,
make it a thousand.

16:29.583 --> 16:32.583
Tigger!

16:32.583 --> 16:34.125
Tigger, no.

16:34.125 --> 16:36.125
Now, where was I?
Uh, oh, yeah.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.000
A baseball bat
and a funny hat,

16:38.000 --> 16:39.875
and eleventy-seventy
thingies like that.

16:39.875 --> 16:42.083
And a lollypop
and a spinning top,

16:42.083 --> 16:45.458
and a marshy-mellow
with legs that hop,
and-- wha--

16:45.458 --> 16:48.750
Oh, Tigger,
I wish Pooh were here.

16:48.750 --> 16:51.958
And-- and, uh-- and--
Hey. Good idea.

16:51.958 --> 16:54.000
Your wish is my command.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.083
Bring me a bear
who's name is Pooh.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.000
And don't forget
his honey, too.

16:58.875 --> 17:01.458
Help!

17:06.000 --> 17:07.458
Oh, no!

17:13.583 --> 17:14.833
Oof.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.708
Why, hello, Rabbit.

17:16.708 --> 17:18.458
Have some honey?

17:18.458 --> 17:20.250
There's plenty.

17:20.250 --> 17:22.291
Pooh. You're safe.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.250
Tigger: A hockey stick
and a bucket of noodles.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.458
Some cookies and cream
and aquamarine,

17:27.458 --> 17:30.458
and a matching pair
of lima beans.

17:30.458 --> 17:34.875
Lima beans. Yuck!
How'd they get in here again?

17:34.875 --> 17:36.333
Oh, well, no matter.

17:36.333 --> 17:37.833
Rabbit will love 'em.

17:37.833 --> 17:39.208
Tigger, no!

17:39.208 --> 17:40.833
And uh, uh--

17:40.833 --> 17:42.833
Oh, gee, Rabbit.
I was just gettin' to

17:42.833 --> 17:44.875
my banana splits
and pogo sticks.

17:44.875 --> 17:47.750
But Tigger,
you've got to stop.

17:47.750 --> 17:50.125
What's the matter?
You're gettin' tired
of carrots?

17:50.125 --> 17:52.875
I got a great set
of lima beans
in here somewhere.

17:54.416 --> 17:56.500
Hiya, Pooh.

17:57.583 --> 17:59.500
Rabbit: No! Look.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.375
Every time you make a wish,

18:01.375 --> 18:03.250
a candle blows out.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.583
Now there are only two left.

18:05.583 --> 18:08.708
two wishes is plenty.

18:08.708 --> 18:11.083
The really important stuff
I saved for last.

18:11.083 --> 18:13.500
A banana split
and a--

18:16.000 --> 18:18.583
Ah, relax,
long ears.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.416
I've still got
one wish left.

18:20.416 --> 18:23.250
And you need it
to get us out of here.

18:23.250 --> 18:25.250
You've got to
wish us home.

18:26.166 --> 18:27.208
Home?

18:31.208 --> 18:32.833
Nah, who wants to go home?

18:32.833 --> 18:34.875
Look at all the neat stuff
we got right here.

18:34.875 --> 18:38.166
Acorns and honey
and carrots and--

18:38.166 --> 18:41.416
Hey, hey,
who's for a nice game
of pingy-pong, eh?

18:46.333 --> 18:47.708
Some icy cream?

18:47.708 --> 18:50.500
Tigger,
this is all wonderful,

18:50.500 --> 18:53.875
but, uh,
sooner or later, we--

18:53.875 --> 18:55.500
we have to go home.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.458
Well...

18:57.458 --> 18:59.708
Say, I could
send you guys back.

18:59.708 --> 19:02.583
But then you'd be
stuck here...

19:02.583 --> 19:03.875
forever.

19:03.875 --> 19:05.208
Yeesh.

19:05.208 --> 19:06.875
What a horribibble thought.

19:06.875 --> 19:08.500
Who'd I play
pingy-pong with?

19:13.458 --> 19:16.000
Uh, guess you guys are right.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.958
But you know, it was
a pretty fun birthday,

19:18.958 --> 19:21.125
considering
it was my first one.

19:21.125 --> 19:25.083
Oh, my,
it was a stupendous
first birthday.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.333
Oh, very nice indeed.

19:29.416 --> 19:31.500
And I promise to
get you the moon

19:31.500 --> 19:33.333
for your next birthday.

19:33.333 --> 19:34.833
Uh, thanks, Pooh,

19:34.833 --> 19:36.708
but maybe you should
leave it where it is.

19:36.708 --> 19:39.708
You wouldn't want us
stumbling around
in the dark, would you?

19:41.125 --> 19:43.958
I wish
I could have my pogo--

19:43.958 --> 19:45.250
Ah-ah-ah!

19:45.250 --> 19:47.250
Sorry, Rabbit.

19:47.250 --> 19:49.125
I guess
the party's over.

19:51.458 --> 19:54.625
Okay. Here... we...

19:54.625 --> 19:55.708
go!

20:08.000 --> 20:10.083
Hurry, Piglet,

20:10.083 --> 20:12.000
before he wakes up.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.166
Oh, yes.

20:17.875 --> 20:19.125
Oh.

20:21.208 --> 20:22.291
Ooh!

20:22.291 --> 20:24.625
Oh, what a birthday.

20:24.625 --> 20:27.000
Good thing they only come
once a year.

20:29.375 --> 20:30.750
Huh?

20:30.750 --> 20:32.833
Hmm. What's this?

20:32.833 --> 20:34.833
Hmm. Oh, yeah.

20:34.833 --> 20:36.375
Oh, interesting.

20:36.375 --> 20:39.375
Well, really, yeah, hmm.

20:41.291 --> 20:42.583
Oh, interesting.

20:42.583 --> 20:45.875
Well, really, yeah. Hmm.

20:45.875 --> 20:47.750
Oh. Well.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.708
Look at this--

20:49.708 --> 20:51.416
Would you believe--

20:51.416 --> 20:52.875
Oh, my.

20:54.875 --> 20:56.000
Well.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.708
Oh, really?
Yes, it is--

20:58.708 --> 21:00.166
Huh?

21:00.166 --> 21:02.583
Kinda dumb leavin'
presents lyin' around.

21:02.583 --> 21:03.875
Why, if it rains,

21:03.875 --> 21:05.583
the wrapping
might get wrinkled.

21:05.583 --> 21:09.375
I--
Happy birthday?

21:09.375 --> 21:11.708
To me?

21:11.708 --> 21:15.875
A banana split.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.416
Then this must be a--

21:17.416 --> 21:19.166
It's gotta be a--

21:19.166 --> 21:22.833
Ya-hoo!

21:22.833 --> 21:26.333
I guess he found
his pogo stick.

21:26.333 --> 21:28.708
Whew.
Then that's that.

21:28.708 --> 21:30.291
Until next year.

21:38.416 --> 21:39.708
My carrots!

21:43.500 --> 21:46.583
Oh, thanks, guys.

21:46.583 --> 21:48.208
Just what I
always wanted.

21:52.416 --> 21:53.958
Tigger. No!

21:53.958 --> 21:55.291
Out! Out!

21:55.291 --> 21:56.375
Out, out, out!

21:56.375 --> 21:57.416
Out!
