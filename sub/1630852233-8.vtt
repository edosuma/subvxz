Jake, how you like that, man?

00:13.096 --> 00:15.432
Tell me how dope that was.

00:15.432 --> 00:17.267
Uh, incredibly dope?

00:17.267 --> 00:18.810
Ooh, you heard him!

00:18.810 --> 00:20.937
I carpool with Janine occasionally

00:21.021 --> 00:23.106
to reduce my carbon footprint,

00:23.106 --> 00:26.776
and Tariq is there sometimes
when he needs to use the car,

00:26.860 --> 00:29.863
which is...all the time.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.656
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm gonna
have to run it back for you.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.408
It takes a couple times
to get the wordplay.

00:33.408 --> 00:34.826
- Mm-hmm.
- Yo, you spit, too?

00:34.826 --> 00:36.494
- Rap with me, Jake.
- Oh, no.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.330
That could potentially be
very undope.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.541
Baby, his name is Jacob. Jacob.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.334
Yeah, some people forget
the "ob."

00:44.419 --> 00:47.672
Is -- Is that what you're gonna
be performing later today?

00:47.756 --> 00:49.674
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And I got way more, too.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.885
The show is about to be lit,
to be honest, man.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.470
The after-party gonna be stupid.

00:53.470 --> 00:54.512
Oh, no.

00:54.596 --> 00:57.682
It is an anti-drug
and gang-violence presentation

00:57.766 --> 00:58.683
for children.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.518
So no after-party.

01:00.602 --> 01:03.146
Tariq's gonna be performing
some of his songs later today

01:03.146 --> 01:06.816
at Abbott for F.A.D.E.,
Friends Against Drug Exposure.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.819
Yeah, he got the gig
totally on his own.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.405
I mean, I reached out
to the organization,

01:12.489 --> 01:15.116
and Tariq said, "Sure."

01:15.200 --> 01:16.451
Oh, baby, I was thinking.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.869
You've been working
way too much lately.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.371
We need to go travel somewhere.

01:19.371 --> 01:20.997
We got that F.A.D.E. money now, girl.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.750
Oh, well, I've always wanted to
go to Paris.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.251
Ooh, ooh, Paris!

01:25.335 --> 01:27.045
Or, uh, uh, Coney Island.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.046
- Oh.
- We could go out there.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.381
I could get my Joe Chestnut on,

01:29.381 --> 01:31.049
you know, chow down
on some Nathan's.

01:31.049 --> 01:33.176
You know,
om nom nom nom nom.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.511
Yes, yes, yes.

01:34.511 --> 01:38.723
But also maybe focus
on the performance today.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.392
- You right. You right.
- Yeah.

01:40.392 --> 01:42.435
We could do that, too. <i>Turn left.</i>

01:42.519 --> 01:44.896
Ooh.
<i>She gonna make a left turn ♪</i>

01:44.896 --> 01:47.357

01:49.234 --> 01:50.610
Oh, my God!

01:50.694 --> 01:52.696
My lyrics don't stop, Jake.
Pay attention.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.739
You're on the ground floor
of something incredible.

01:54.823 --> 01:58.118
Yeah, it definitely feels
like...the ground floor.

02:10.505 --> 02:13.091
You know, a lot of people
are slow to warm to Tariq,

02:13.091 --> 02:15.593
but you guys get along so well.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.721
Maybe you should come out and
get pizza with us this weekend.

02:17.721 --> 02:20.890
Oh, I can't.
I'm busy on Saturday.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.934
I didn't even say a date yet.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.686
W-- Oh, I see what's happening.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.062
You don't want to be
the third wheel.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.564
- No.
- No. Don't worry.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.691
I actually know a great guy
I want to set you up with.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.443
Uh, thanks, but I don't know
how my boyfriend

02:31.443 --> 02:33.194
would feel about that.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.531
Your what?

02:36.531 --> 02:38.283
My boyfriend.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.618
You have a boyfriend?

02:40.702 --> 02:43.121
- What's his name?
- Uh, Zach.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.706
Zach?

02:44.706 --> 02:46.833
And how long have you two
been dating?

02:46.833 --> 02:50.253
Like a year, plus another year.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.881
Jacob, how did I not know
any of this?

02:52.881 --> 02:54.424
You've never mentioned him.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.843
Well, actually, I guess I just
answered my own question.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.554
I thought you knew. I mean,
I could've swore I told you.

02:59.554 --> 03:02.182
My friends say I won't
shut up about him.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.725
Your friends?

03:03.725 --> 03:05.352
I thought we were friends.

03:05.352 --> 03:09.230
We are. Yeah, we're friends.
We're just, you know...

03:09.314 --> 03:11.191
"You know" what?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.401
W-Work friends.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.487
We don't talk about
real deep stuff.

03:15.487 --> 03:18.031
You told me when you got
a tapeworm in Zimbabwe.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.200
Um, um, yeah, I was --
I was trying to be helpful,

03:20.200 --> 03:22.577
in case you ever go to Africa.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.829
Look, work friends
are still friends.

03:24.913 --> 03:28.124
They're just, like,
friends in one place.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.418
Well, I thought we were friends
in all places.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.671
We are -- We are friends
in other places, actually.

03:32.671 --> 03:35.507
You know, just today we were --
we were friends together,

03:35.507 --> 03:37.592
you know, from my apartment
to the school...

03:37.676 --> 03:39.427
...where -- where we work,

03:39.511 --> 03:41.262
as friends.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.058
Um...

03:45.892 --> 03:48.353
I can't believe Jacob
didn't tell me about Zach.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.271
I mean, I have
so many questions, okay?

03:50.355 --> 03:52.691
Is he tall? Is he a cat person
or a dog person?

03:52.691 --> 03:55.026
Is Zach spelled with a "ck"
or a "ch"

03:55.110 --> 03:58.113
or, what I find to be the most
exotic spelling, just a "c"?

03:58.113 --> 04:00.365
And... I don't know.
Maybe he's right.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.534
Maybe we are just work friends,

04:02.534 --> 04:05.662
because a "friend" friend
would know.

04:05.662 --> 04:08.957
Okay. Eyes up here.
Farmer Hank has five turkeys.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.500
Then he buys four more.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.336
How many turkeys
does Farmer Hank have?

04:13.420 --> 04:15.296
Are any turkeys pregnant?

04:15.380 --> 04:18.008
Guys, let's focus, okay?
Uh, you know what?

04:18.008 --> 04:19.551
We're gonna do more math drills.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.346
Statewide assessments
are coming up.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.889
It's a necessary evil.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.349
They say not to teach
to the test,

04:26.433 --> 04:28.351
but if that were the case,

04:28.435 --> 04:30.311
they wouldn't give tests,
would they?

04:30.395 --> 04:31.521
Six plus seven?

04:31.521 --> 04:33.481
13!

04:33.565 --> 04:36.151
- 13 minus 6?
- Can we please take a break?

04:38.737 --> 04:40.530
Is everything okay?

04:40.530 --> 04:43.366
I-I didn't see your class
at morning recess.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.201
Yeah. Yeah. No.
Everything's fine.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.998
Kids, turn to page 13 minus 6.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.293
Seven.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.295
So, the whole class
is underperforming,

04:55.295 --> 04:57.547
specifically in math,
so we're taking time in recess

04:57.547 --> 04:59.382
to practice
to get those scores up.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.385
Well, you know,
it's always been my thought

05:02.469 --> 05:04.637
that if one child fails...

05:04.721 --> 05:06.306
- Mm-hmm.
- ...it's on the child.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.349
- Right.
- But --

05:07.349 --> 05:11.311
But if all of the children fail,
it's on their teacher.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.399
If there's something
I'm doing wrong

05:16.483 --> 05:18.401
or if it can be improved upon,

05:18.485 --> 05:22.030
I am more than happy, uh,
to take some pointers.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.616
Wonderful.
Lunchtime.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.284
You and me.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.578
Yes. Sure.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.623
I am more than happy
to give up some of my free time

05:31.623 --> 05:34.793
to gain knowledge
and better myself.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.047
I still didn't get my answer.
13 minus 6?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.050
That "uh" better be
you thinking.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.932
Well, looks like
I'm not eating today,

05:48.932 --> 05:51.059
'cause if you think I'm getting
this hair wet, mnh-mnh.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.311
Yep, it's gonna be
vending-machine lunch.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.021
- Oh.
- Well, look on the bright side.

05:55.105 --> 05:58.358
Now we get to all stay inside
and have lunch together,

05:58.358 --> 06:01.945
which will be nice because,
despite what some people say,

06:01.945 --> 06:04.197
we all love each other,
like one big, happy family.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.032
Ugh, what are you
talking about?

06:06.116 --> 06:08.618
I told her we're work friends,
and now she's doing this.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.121
Well, we are work friends.
What's the problem?

06:11.121 --> 06:13.665
Uh, no. No, no, no.
We are a family.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.125
"We're family."

06:15.125 --> 06:17.252
Enough with that
Dominic Toretto rhetoric.

06:17.252 --> 06:20.005
Th-There's a reason that there
are nine of those movies.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.965
Honey, family you kill for.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.759
I ain't killing for any of ya.
Except Barbara.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.804
Look, we come here,
we love our kids,

06:27.804 --> 06:30.807
we exchange
some delightful repartee.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.934
We are good colleagues.

06:33.018 --> 06:35.395
And then we leave.
There's nothing wrong with that.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.148
But I just feel like
it doesn't have to be that way.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.816
Girl, this ain't a sorority.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.776
I'm not shoplifting Plan B
for you.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.945
See, this is what people
are trying to avoid.

06:44.029 --> 06:44.988
I know.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.698
I just think we should spend
the time

06:46.698 --> 06:48.825
to get to know each other better.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.498
Oh, they may not want to share,

06:55.582 --> 06:57.876
but I have ways
of making people talk.

06:57.876 --> 07:00.253
Mm.

07:01.379 --> 07:05.884
I have enlisted the help of one
of Abbott Elementary's finest.

07:05.884 --> 07:09.346
Now, come on, come on.
Show us what you got.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.598
What, here?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.850
- Yeah!
- Yeah, here. Get this kid.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.894
Of course here. Come on.
Teach us something.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.520
Uh, all right.

07:17.604 --> 07:22.359
Um, Farmer Hank has seven
turkeys, then he buys six more.

07:22.359 --> 07:24.361
How many turkeys does
Farmer Hank now have?

07:24.361 --> 07:26.780
- Hmm.
- Is one of the turkeys pregnant?

07:26.780 --> 07:28.239
One of my kids asked
the same thing.

07:28.323 --> 07:29.991
Because it's a good question,

07:30.075 --> 07:32.744
and it shows that they're using
critical thinking.

07:32.744 --> 07:33.870
It's irrelevant.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.872
No, it might be silly to you,

07:35.872 --> 07:37.999
but to them, it might be
an important question that,

07:38.083 --> 07:40.418
if they don't get it answered,
they can't focus.

07:40.502 --> 07:43.296
And diversions are
an important part of learning.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.382
Otherwise,
they're just memorizing.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.592
Memorization is how I learned
all the states' capitals.

07:47.676 --> 07:50.136
Juneau, Salem, Madison.
I can keep going.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.389
In my class,
we do silly voice time

07:52.389 --> 07:54.307
to, you know, break up the day.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.893
And it
makes learning more fun, too.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.062
Okay.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.897
Follow my lead.
Here we go.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.232
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.233
What's happening?

08:03.233 --> 08:05.443
Oh, come on, now, son.

08:05.527 --> 08:08.154
Moving those hips a little,
it is not going to kill you.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.615
Now, let's do this
math problem again.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.367
Oh, what's
the turkey farmer's name?

08:12.367 --> 08:14.160
- Hank?
- Yes!

08:14.244 --> 08:15.745
All right.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.747
<i>Hank has two turkeys ♪</i>

08:17.831 --> 08:19.916
<i>He gets two more ♪</i>

08:19.916 --> 08:23.003
<i>How many turkeys? ♪</i>

08:25.171 --> 08:27.590
<i>Hank has two turkeys ♪</i>

08:27.674 --> 08:29.676
<i>He gets two more ♪</i>

08:29.676 --> 08:32.053
<i>How many turkeys? ♪</i>

08:32.137 --> 08:33.763
<i>He has four ♪</i>

08:33.847 --> 08:35.140
Aah! Yes!

08:35.140 --> 08:36.933
Or six if one of the turkeys

08:37.017 --> 08:39.102
is pregnant with twins.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.938
See? Who told you
learning can't be fun?

08:42.022 --> 08:43.648
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

08:43.732 --> 08:44.941
Hey, guys.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.818
Oh, you look a m--

08:46.818 --> 08:48.361
Wait a minute.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.780
What is that smell?

08:50.864 --> 08:52.365
Is that...

08:52.449 --> 08:55.368
Danny Wok's makes the best
chicken in all of Philly.

08:55.452 --> 08:59.247
I don't know what Danny puts
in that chicken, but it woks.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.291
Mmm!
That was very thoughtful of you.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.001
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

09:03.001 --> 09:05.128
If you want the "Wok"...

09:05.128 --> 09:07.339
...you gotta talk.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.967
Okay. So, I thought we all
could play a little game

09:11.051 --> 09:12.177
to get to know
each other better.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.221

that you had Danny Wok.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.140
That's the only reason
I'm here, Dork Dash.

09:17.140 --> 09:20.685
It's a simple, fun game where
we write down a little fact

09:20.769 --> 09:22.395
about ourselves on these cards,

09:22.479 --> 09:24.147
something you think
no one else knows.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.648
Then the cards are shuffled,

09:25.732 --> 09:27.609
and we try to figure out
who each secret belongs to.

09:27.609 --> 09:28.610
It's so fun.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.445
- When do we get the chicken?
- When you tell a secret.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.155
My cousin turned down the hit
on Bobby Kennedy.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.366
Not that kind of secret,
and we write it down.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.659
Janine, please,
just give me the food.

09:36.743 --> 09:40.497
Guys, you get the wings
when you say the things.

09:40.497 --> 09:41.831
Okay.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.336
Don't love being left out
of huddles.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.962
Okay.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.925
Oh, I can feel us
getting closer already.

09:51.925 --> 09:55.053
Okay, Sister Sledge,
let's get this over with.

09:55.053 --> 09:58.264
All right. So, "I once drank
three cups of coffee,

09:58.348 --> 09:59.849
thinking it was decaf,

09:59.933 --> 10:02.185
and started tap-dancing
in front of my students"?

10:02.185 --> 10:04.104
Wasn't me.
- Okay, I no longer

10:04.104 --> 10:06.356
keep tap shoes in my classroom. Okay.

10:06.356 --> 10:09.693
"I won a bronze medal
for a hammer throw

10:09.693 --> 10:12.362
in the 1976 Olympics."

10:12.362 --> 10:14.030
What can I say?

10:14.114 --> 10:16.032
The rumors about
the Olympic Village are true.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.951
Let's move on.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.078
"I once impersonated Jill Scott

10:20.078 --> 10:23.623
to get free bottle service
at Xfinity Live!"

10:24.541 --> 10:26.042
You don't even
look like Jill Scott.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.044
To white people in South Philly
I do.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.046
Sorry. I got to take this.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.340
Okay.
Hurry back.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.175
Hey, Pop.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.845
<i>Gregory...you get a chance</i>

10:36.845 --> 10:39.264
<i>to look at those job listings
I e-mailed you?</i>

10:39.264 --> 10:41.266
You know, I-I haven't -- I
haven't gotten around to it yet.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.018
<i>Get around to it.</i>

10:43.018 --> 10:44.894
<i>When you gonna quit
your babysitting gig,</i>

10:44.978 --> 10:47.022
<i>get yourself a real job?</i>

10:47.022 --> 10:49.357
<i>You know who else could teach
a first grader?</i>

10:49.441 --> 10:51.192
<i>A second grader.</i>

10:51.276 --> 10:52.777
That's funny, sir.

10:52.861 --> 10:53.945
I actually, um, applied

10:54.029 --> 10:55.989
to a few other principal jobs
at other schools.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.323
I'm just waiting to hear back.

10:57.407 --> 11:00.118
<i>Why don't you come work at the
landscaping company with me?</i>

11:00.702 --> 11:02.537
<i>This school idea,
I don't get it.</i>

11:02.537 --> 11:04.122
<i>You've been trying
to become a principal</i>

11:04.122 --> 11:05.790
<i>since you left college.</i>

11:05.874 --> 11:09.294
<i>Come do a real man's job.
Time to grow up, Gregory.</i>

11:10.462 --> 11:13.631
I will consider that, sir.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.425
<i>I'll take it.</i>

11:15.425 --> 11:16.718
All right.

11:24.059 --> 11:26.061
You loved <i>Green Book?</i>

11:26.061 --> 11:28.438
It is a well-made film, okay?

11:28.438 --> 11:31.232
Do I think it's the most astute
observation on race relations?

11:31.316 --> 11:34.611
No. But did I cry at the end?
Almost.

11:34.611 --> 11:37.238
Okay, um, Gregory,
why don't you pull a card?

11:37.322 --> 11:39.657
Uh, I think I'll pass
on this one, thanks.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.326
Okay.
No chicken for you.

11:41.326 --> 11:42.619
All right.
So I'll go.

11:42.619 --> 11:45.080
This mystery person says,

11:45.080 --> 11:47.916
"I've been dating my boyfriend
since eighth grade."

11:47.916 --> 11:50.502
Ooh!
I wonder who this could be.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.921
Wait.
Like, off and on?

11:52.921 --> 11:55.423
Well, who says it's me?
But no, just on.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.550
- The whole time?
- Yeah.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.177
But you've dated
lots of other people?

11:59.177 --> 12:01.054
Nope.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.640
Why are you all looking at me
like that?

12:03.640 --> 12:04.849
Janine, sweetheart,

12:04.933 --> 12:08.144
you have only dated one man
your entire life?

12:08.228 --> 12:09.437
Yeah.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.856
No women?
Nobody else, ever?

12:11.940 --> 12:14.109
That just answers
so many things. I mean...

12:14.109 --> 12:16.027
Somebody get me a chair.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.867
Is -- Is the guy rich?

12:22.951 --> 12:26.663
No, not monetarily.
He's an aspiring musician.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.915
So he broke?
Somebody get me a fresh chair.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.542
Look, you don't know Tariq.

12:30.542 --> 12:33.503
He's sweet. He's caring.
He's ambitious.

12:33.503 --> 12:34.921
Jacob knows.

12:35.005 --> 12:36.673
Oh, I've...

12:36.673 --> 12:38.008
He's very spirited.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.175
Spirited?

12:39.259 --> 12:41.553
I could use a little bit
more help than that, Jacob.

12:41.553 --> 12:44.597
You know, he's...confident.

12:45.932 --> 12:49.060
And, um, he's a real
extemporaneous thinker.

12:49.144 --> 12:50.353
Hmm!

12:50.437 --> 12:51.938
I-I'm still getting to
know him, I guess.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.440
Et tu, work friend?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.066
You were beatboxing with him
this morning.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.359
Did that mean nothing?

12:56.443 --> 12:58.820
One joystick.

12:58.820 --> 12:59.821
Wait.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.531
Does that mean that you're,
like, secretly Mormon?

13:01.531 --> 13:02.866
- No.
- Oh.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.576
You should be
'cause you need more men.

13:04.576 --> 13:05.910
- Can I get it?
- Barbara!

13:05.994 --> 13:08.872
I'm sorry, Janine, but that
was actually very clever.

13:08.872 --> 13:11.249
Look, this is the man
I'm going to marry.

13:11.249 --> 13:14.753
Janine, when people get married,
they try a lot of cakes.

13:14.753 --> 13:17.630
Have you had two slices of cake
at one time?

13:17.714 --> 13:20.091
I can tell you, when I was
at the Olympic Village...

13:20.175 --> 13:23.345
You know what? He is a good guy,
and I love him.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.513
But how do you know if this
has only been the one guy?

13:25.597 --> 13:26.681
But haven't you ever worri--
wondered,

13:26.765 --> 13:27.766
like, what --
who else is out there?

13:27.766 --> 13:30.226
- I mean, you've only...
- Janine, you need to grow up.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.978
The whole time, one guy?

13:32.062 --> 13:33.563
Ohh!

13:36.316 --> 13:37.817
Ohh.

13:44.032 --> 13:47.243
Oh. Hold on.
You're gonna get drenched.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.037
Thanks.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.288
You okay?

13:50.372 --> 13:52.582
Yeah. Are they still in there
making fun of me?

13:52.582 --> 13:55.543
It's only been a few seconds,
so yeah, probably.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.295
Look, you can't care about

13:57.379 --> 13:59.005
what other people think
about your choices

13:59.089 --> 14:00.632
'cause at the end of the day
you're the one

14:00.632 --> 14:02.717
who got to live with them.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.223
My dad doesn't want me
to be a teacher.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.141
What?

14:10.225 --> 14:12.018
But teaching's the best job
in the world.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.104
Well, Lieutenant Colonel
Martin Eddie

14:14.104 --> 14:15.730
doesn't see it that way.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.440
But it shouldn't matter
what he thinks, right?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.901
It should be about
what makes me happy?

14:19.901 --> 14:21.778
Does teaching make you happy?

14:24.447 --> 14:25.657
It could.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.747
Does Tariq make you happy?

14:38.044 --> 14:40.714
Hey!
What y'all doing out here?

14:40.714 --> 14:43.091
It's raining harder
than an Usher video!

14:43.091 --> 14:45.301
- Um...
- We're just here to greet you.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.303
- I'm Gregory.
- Oh, what's up, Gregory?

14:47.387 --> 14:49.431
Are you the talent handler?

14:49.431 --> 14:51.099
Sure.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.059
I need some bananas
in the greenroom.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.317
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.485
Everything okay?
You seem off.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.572
Uh, yeah. No.
I'm just nervous for you.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.573
Don't be nervous.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.867
This is gonna be like when Lil
Nas X performed at that school.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.535
- Mm.
- Except it's not a surprise

15:10.535 --> 15:13.830
and they don't know the words
and I'm very straight.

15:13.830 --> 15:14.956
But come on.
Come on.

15:15.040 --> 15:15.999
- Bring it in.
- Yeah.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.375
- Yeah.
- Okay.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.586
Lord, thank you for giving me
this opportunity

15:19.586 --> 15:22.422
to blow the impressionable minds
of these young children.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.506
- Amen.
- Amen.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.758
- Okay.
- All right. Come on.

15:27.469 --> 15:31.765
Oh, yeah, get it, get it,
get it, hey, let's go, go!

15:31.765 --> 15:33.767
- Okay. I love you, baby.
- I love you, baby.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.685
Let's get it!
Yeah!

15:35.769 --> 15:38.355
Yeah, it's really hard breaking
into the industry right now.

15:38.355 --> 15:41.691
Nobody's in that anti-drug,
anti-alcohol lane, you know?

15:41.775 --> 15:44.110
Don't nobody rap about stuff
that's good for you.

15:44.194 --> 15:47.364
You never heard a song called,
like..."Broccoli."

15:47.364 --> 15:49.157
Except that one song
called "Broccoli,"

15:49.157 --> 15:51.201
but that's still about drugs,
so -- Uh-oh.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.244
Stage manager pulling
me away, y'all.

15:53.328 --> 15:54.746
Tour life.
You feel me?

15:54.746 --> 15:56.915
Hey, you got them Tastykakes,
my man?

15:56.915 --> 15:58.750
I'm a girl!

15:59.292 --> 16:01.252
Uh, okay, shawty.
Where is my dessert?

Yeah. <i>Last Man Standing</i>
is basically your <i>Green Book.</i>

17:19.039 --> 17:22.375
But why didn't you tell me you
had a boyfriend this whole time?

17:24.002 --> 17:25.045
I don't know.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.589

17:27.589 --> 17:29.674
if I kept you out of

17:29.758 --> 17:32.927
I wouldn't have to

17:44.481 --> 17:46.483
That'd be pretty messed up,
wouldn't it?

17:46.483 --> 17:47.984
That was like

18:24.104 --> 18:25.647
Oh, let's go.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.357
Oh, okay, I see you,
talent handler!

18:27.357 --> 18:29.526
Oh, he going crazy!
Yeah!

18:29.526 --> 18:31.403

- Oh!

18:31.403 --> 18:32.946
Okay.
Wow.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.739
Gregory dances.

18:34.823 --> 18:38.368
I don't think I've ever seen him
experience...joy before.

18:38.368 --> 18:41.663
It's... It's weird.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.331

18:51.381 --> 18:53.341
I-I want to do
a quick shout-out.

18:53.425 --> 18:55.093
Shout-out
to a very special person

18:55.093 --> 18:57.220
and the -- and the whole reason
that I'm here.

18:57.220 --> 19:00.724
This woman is my everything,
my ride-or-die since day one.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.934
He means that literally,
like out the womb.

19:03.018 --> 19:04.728
To the most amazing
second grade teacher

19:04.728 --> 19:06.688

19:06.688 --> 19:08.398
and the only woman
I ever been with...

19:08.398 --> 19:09.858

19:09.858 --> 19:12.068

- Love you, too.

19:13.695 --> 19:15.030
Yeah!

19:24.706 --> 19:29.419
So, um, tell me --
as a friend --

19:29.419 --> 19:33.006
what do you really think
of Tariq?

19:34.883 --> 19:38.803
I had an ex back home that I was
certain I would be with forever.

19:38.887 --> 19:40.472
What happened?

19:40.472 --> 19:42.140
I realized I outgrew him.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.392
You know, it was no one's fault.

19:44.476 --> 19:47.729
But I realized I couldn't be
the best Jacob I could be.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.606
Was it hard to let go?

19:49.606 --> 19:51.608
Extremely.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.568
But if I hadn't,
I wouldn't have met Zach.

19:53.568 --> 19:56.905
Ah, yes. Zach, boyfriend of two
years that I knew nothing about.

19:56.905 --> 19:59.282
He's 5'9".

19:59.366 --> 20:02.619
He loves dogs.
He spells his name with a "ch."

20:02.619 --> 20:04.662
All right.
Well, that's a start.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.456
I'd love to meet him one day.

20:06.456 --> 20:09.042
Unless, you know,
we're not there yet.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.379
I'll bring him around.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.005
Hey, whatever you do,

20:14.089 --> 20:17.425
you should know that I love
and support you as a friend.

20:18.802 --> 20:20.178
And, most importantly,

20:20.178 --> 20:24.474
maybe give yourself a chance to
be the best Janine you can be.

20:24.474 --> 20:26.142
Let's go! Let's go!

20:26.226 --> 20:29.187
Yeah! Let's go.
Whoo!

20:36.111 --> 20:38.613
Okay. This is gonna be on
your assessment, so let's focus.

20:38.697 --> 20:42.283
If there are 12 bikes
and Riley buys 4,

20:42.367 --> 20:45.620
how many bikes are left
in the store?

20:45.704 --> 20:47.956
Why does Riley need
so many bikes?

20:49.666 --> 20:52.293
That is a good question.
For his friends.

20:52.377 --> 20:53.795
Is he in a bicycle gang?

20:54.504 --> 20:55.839
Yes.

20:55.839 --> 20:58.550
Then there's 8 bikes left.

20:58.550 --> 20:59.926
That's correct.

21:00.010 --> 21:01.886
Can you do the dance?

21:01.970 --> 21:03.471
What did I say?

21:03.555 --> 21:06.141
You get this right,
then we dancin'.

21:06.141 --> 21:08.018
Come on, y'all.
Get up with it.

21:08.018 --> 21:10.145
Hey, okay.

21:10.145 --> 21:12.313
Okay.
All right.

21:12.397 --> 21:14.858
Let's go.
Hey, oh, oh.

21:14.858 --> 21:17.027
Oh!

21:17.027 --> 21:19.112
Hey, oh!

21:19.112 --> 21:20.989
Hey!

21:29.497 --> 21:32.333
