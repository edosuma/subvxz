00:45.128 --> 00:46.421
I don't want any trouble!

Sorry. Can't understand you.

Fury, with me!

But, boss...

01:36.304 --> 01:37.806
Everyman? What are you
doing here?

01:37.889 --> 01:39.349
Did you see anyone run past?

01:39.432 --> 01:41.309
Sorry, boss.

Nothing. You know what to do.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.739
What if someone sees?

02:36.823 --> 02:37.782
Coast is clear.

02:39.909 --> 02:40.785
Hmm.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.539
Uh...

02:44.622 --> 02:48.084
I'm still not very good
at levitating anything
except myself.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.252
Uh, I might drop you.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.129
I'll take my chances

02:53.965 --> 02:57.218
So, met your new roommate?

02:57.302 --> 02:58.761
We video chatted.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.305
She seems nice.

03:00.388 --> 03:03.057
"Nice"? Wow. Great.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.435
-What's wrong?
-Nothing. I...

03:05.518 --> 03:10.815
I mean, you've got new powers,
new clothes, new school,
new roommate.

03:10.899 --> 03:14.611
You definitely won't miss
an old friend
who's working at the D.W.P.,

03:14.694 --> 03:16.362
instead of going to college.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.407
Harper, we will
always be friends.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.243
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.578
It's just...

03:23.661 --> 03:25.455
[sighs]

03:25.538 --> 03:29.417
Vi, you're my best friend
and I don't wanna
mess that up, but

03:29.500 --> 03:32.462
you're not with Brion anymore,
and I dumped Jack.

03:32.545 --> 03:38.718
So if I'm being honest,
for a long time, I've wanted
to be more than friends.

03:41.888 --> 03:42.805
I'm gonna go.

03:42.889 --> 03:43.932
[gasps]

03:44.015 --> 03:45.141
You don't have to
answer me now.

03:45.224 --> 03:46.225
Just...

03:47.518 --> 03:48.686
Think about it.

[indistinct radio conversation]

[camera shutter clicking]

04:01.074 --> 04:03.409
I do not like
the looks of this.

[Zviad Baazovi]
<i>Mahns Karalis! Sveika!</i>

04:08.414 --> 04:12.210
Ambassador, we almost had
Wilhelm Vittings in the forest.

04:12.293 --> 04:15.588
But somehow he evaded Everyman.

04:15.672 --> 04:16.756
I'm starting to wonder--

04:16.839 --> 04:18.633
[Zviad Baazovi]
Forget Vittings.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.511
Tonight, you sent
a powerful message
to these radical anti-metas

04:21.594 --> 04:23.972
trying to force metas
out of Markovia.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.599
We must focus
on the big picture.

04:26.683 --> 04:27.767
True.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.561
Let us be clear.

04:30.645 --> 04:34.107
Despite a few bad actors,
we want the world to know

04:34.190 --> 04:37.944
that Markovia
welcomes meta-humans.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.821
You have a home here.

04:39.904 --> 04:43.241
My Infinitors and I
will protect you.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.534
[camera shutters clicking]

04:56.838 --> 04:58.673
Listen, we don't have
much time.

04:58.756 --> 05:01.175
My name is Tinya Wazzo.
Phantom Girl.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.553
I'm a member of the Legion of--
[sighs]

05:03.636 --> 05:05.555
Never mind. You won't know it.

05:05.638 --> 05:08.057
But the thing is,
I can phase through matter.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.351
Like how Miss Martian
density-shifts.

05:10.435 --> 05:15.231
Except, I do it by phasing
between your dimension
and my home dimension of Bgztl.

05:15.314 --> 05:20.194
I've been putting it together,
and I think that's how
we wound up here.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.406
[Phantom Girl]
<i>Back on Mars, my friends and I</i>
<i>were trying to protect you.</i>

05:23.489 --> 05:25.783
<i>So when you were</i>
<i>about to die</i>
<i>in that explosion...</i>

05:25.867 --> 05:27.535
[screaming]

05:27.618 --> 05:31.247
<i>I attempted to phase us both</i>
<i>to Bgztl to save your life...</i>

05:31.330 --> 05:34.459
But between the pain and your
body's high density,

05:34.542 --> 05:36.711
we didn't make it.

05:36.794 --> 05:39.422
[Phantom Girl]
See, think of this circle
as Mars,

05:39.505 --> 05:41.424
and this one as Bgztl.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.969
I'm guessing the Phantom Zone
is a trans-dimensional buffer
between the two.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.263
Well, not between
the two planets,

05:47.346 --> 05:50.475
but the two dimensions
that contain those planets.

05:50.558 --> 05:54.270
Just getting here
knocked me out for...
I don't know how long!

05:54.353 --> 05:58.107
So this'll be difficult,
but I think I can
get us both back.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.777
I know it's confusing.
But I'll explain it all later.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.737
Right now,
we need to get out of here!

06:06.115 --> 06:07.700
You're fighting me.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.912
Your willpower's
like an anchor,
tying us to the Zone.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.997
Let go, so I can
bring you home.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.499
I can't leave.

06:14.582 --> 06:16.626
I've pledged my loyalty to Zod.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.936
If we're going to rescue S.B.,
we need to find it.

06:38.397 --> 06:41.192
You'd think finding
one old school bus
would be easy.

06:41.275 --> 06:42.485
[Tigress] Found it!

06:43.402 --> 06:44.821
Ah, great job!

06:44.904 --> 06:47.740
Phantom Zone, here we come!

06:47.824 --> 06:49.784
[Tigress] Yeah, that might
be a problem...

06:54.163 --> 06:56.582
[Geo-Force]<i> I remember you</i>
<i>from Cuba.</i>

06:56.666 --> 07:00.753
We, I mean the Outsiders,
rescued you from Klarion.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.922
It's, eh, Johnny, correct?

07:03.005 --> 07:06.050
-[awkwardly] Lizard Johnny.
-Good! Own it.

07:06.134 --> 07:09.345
I'm honored you chose Markovia,
Lizard Johnny.

07:09.428 --> 07:11.514
Don't let these thugs
give you the wrong idea.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.975
I will not allow anyone
to harm you.

07:14.058 --> 07:17.728
You mean you'll do them
like you did your uncle?

07:17.812 --> 07:19.480
[stuttering] Sorry!

07:19.564 --> 07:23.192
It was all over the news.
A-and I'm not looking
for a fight.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.694
I just want to be left alone.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.989
I understand.
And you shouldn't
have to fight.

07:28.072 --> 07:31.868
Markovia can be
whatever kind of home
you need it to be.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.536
[speaking Markovian]

07:38.708 --> 07:40.543
How are you doing, my boy?

07:40.626 --> 07:43.129
A traumatic experience
like that?

07:43.212 --> 07:45.214
-You must be so angry!
-I...

07:45.298 --> 07:47.884
Not unlike the anger
felt by our King,

07:47.967 --> 07:51.220
who did what he had to do
to defend himself

07:51.304 --> 07:53.848
and others,
from his traitorous uncle.

07:53.931 --> 07:57.518
Yeah, yeah! That's right!

08:01.022 --> 08:04.025
[speaking Markovian]

08:25.379 --> 08:28.257
No... That's not what we want.

08:28.341 --> 08:32.053
If the High and Mighty League
were taking care
of these children,

08:32.136 --> 08:34.931
they wouldn't need us,
would they?

08:35.014 --> 08:36.557
-That's right.
<i>-Pareizi!</i>

08:36.641 --> 08:38.559
[Zviad Baazovi] Wonderful!
I'm glad we're in agreement.

08:38.643 --> 08:42.605
Come, Mueller. No need
to bother the Karalis
with details.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.733
[Geo-Force] Where's Johnny?

08:48.694 --> 08:50.446
[Dinah]<i> Okay,</i>

08:50.529 --> 08:52.865
I think everyone planning
to come to this month's group
is here...

08:52.949 --> 08:54.242
Who would like to share?

08:54.325 --> 08:55.618
[dog panting]

08:55.701 --> 08:58.663
I'm all moved in at Ivy,
ready to start classes.

08:58.746 --> 09:01.249
I also stopped by
the Muslim Student Association

09:01.332 --> 09:04.126
and signed up
for their orientation.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.629
I feel like I have
a whole new life starting.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.590
That's great, Vi!
You've come such a long way.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.926
I'm sensing a 'but' coming.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.595
Normal sensing.
Nothing psychic.

09:14.679 --> 09:20.142
Someone I care about
has expressed...
interest in me.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.811
Uh, romantic interest.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.647
Gee, I wonder
who that could be?

09:24.730 --> 09:26.315
[gasps] You knew?

09:26.399 --> 09:28.734
<i>Sveika,</i> Megan! She's been
crushing on you for a year.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.487
-Who we talking about?
-[Dinah] You don't have to
give us a name.

09:31.570 --> 09:35.324
But, maybe tell us how this
person's 'romantic interest'
made you feel?

09:35.408 --> 09:38.035
[stuttering] I can't tell how
I feel, because I'm...

09:38.119 --> 09:40.329
[inhales sharply] ...blocked.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.497
I...

09:41.580 --> 09:43.291
I believe I am
a little bit broken.

09:43.374 --> 09:45.501
I think we're all
a little bit broken.

09:45.584 --> 09:48.587
Huh, or, you know,
a lot broken.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.339
This "blockage".

09:50.423 --> 09:51.591
It is Brion, yes?

09:51.674 --> 09:55.469
I have so many
unresolved feelings.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.805
Violet, I love my brother.

09:57.888 --> 10:01.684
And I'd love nothing more
than for you to be
part of his life.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.769
But Brion made his choices.

10:03.853 --> 10:07.189
You cannot be expected
to put your life on hold
for him.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.899
[Victor] Maybe
you need closure.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.193
What if you reached out
one last time?
Call him or text.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.612
Remember, we aren't here
to offer advice.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.906
Relate your personal
experiences but

10:15.990 --> 10:17.658
try not to tell others
what to do.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.535
Oh, right. Um...

10:19.618 --> 10:23.748
when my dad and I
had our issues, it helped
that he tried to reach out.

10:23.831 --> 10:25.958
Gave me the chance to respond.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.712
He told me it was important
to him to know he'd tried.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.548
[Dinah] There are no right
or wrong answers here.

10:32.631 --> 10:35.426
Only you can decide
what makes sense for you.

[Helga]<i> It is a fact!</i>
<i>Meta-Positive teens</i>

where, in a safe,

10:48.606 --> 10:51.192
those who have not had
their meta-genes activated,

10:51.275 --> 10:55.196
are given the option,
on a strictly voluntary basis,

10:55.279 --> 10:59.575
to undergo a simple T.R.

Yes!

11:39.156 --> 11:40.991
-Lizard Johnny?
-King Brion!

I want to become a Cadet

Such is the magic

he could've joined the Team

12:07.643 --> 12:11.147
It seems the King and I
have much to discuss.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.274
Is that what<i> you</i> want, Your
Majesty?

12:13.899 --> 12:15.109
I...

12:15.192 --> 12:16.819
Yes.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.487
There is much to discuss.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.745
General Zod is a tyrant
who attempted a coup

12:26.829 --> 12:29.665
simply because
he didn't approve of
how the Kryptonian government

12:29.748 --> 12:31.876
interacted with
the New Genesians.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.836
And if Zod gets out
of the Phantom Zone,

12:33.919 --> 12:36.839
he'll stage a coup
to conquer the entire galaxy!

12:36.922 --> 12:38.966
He doesn't deserve
your loyalty.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.509
He's one of the bad guys.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.678
He's one of the worst guys!

12:42.761 --> 12:45.347
[Ursa] Superboy, we have
more questions.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.932
Please, say nothing.

12:49.768 --> 12:51.270
Such loyalty.

12:51.353 --> 12:54.356
Still you watch over her,
though she may never wake.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.400
She's awake now.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.485
[gasps]

12:59.195 --> 13:00.112
[vehicle approaching]

13:03.449 --> 13:04.575
The mission's here?

13:04.658 --> 13:06.577
Just follow our lead.

13:06.660 --> 13:07.578
[doorbell rings]

13:08.662 --> 13:10.122
Infinitors?

13:10.206 --> 13:12.708
It is a little late
for a visit.

13:12.791 --> 13:15.336
We know, Minister.
But it is urgent.

13:15.419 --> 13:19.423
Markovia must remain
a safe haven for Meta-Humans.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.717
I, well, agree, of course.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.512
I've always supported
the King's policy.

13:27.431 --> 13:30.226
Is this because of what I said
to His Highness

13:30.309 --> 13:32.728
about recruiting Metas
away from the League?

13:32.811 --> 13:34.146
Not necessarily.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.732
It just raises
a larger question.

13:36.815 --> 13:40.486
How can we be sure
of your loyalty to Meta-Humans,

13:40.569 --> 13:45.074
when you and your family
don't have the meta-gene?

13:45.157 --> 13:47.076
My... family?

13:47.159 --> 13:49.495
A wife and two kids, right?

13:49.578 --> 13:50.913
Asleep upstairs?

13:50.996 --> 13:52.206
[growling]

13:52.289 --> 13:55.000
I'd sure love to meet them.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.627
What are you doing? Stop!

13:56.710 --> 14:00.256
It seems many non-metas
like you and your family

14:00.339 --> 14:04.426
feel more comfortable
across the border in Vlatava.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.136
Food for thought.

14:07.846 --> 14:10.558
Yo, holding me back like that?

14:11.767 --> 14:13.561
Great touch!

14:13.644 --> 14:16.772
[chuckling] You see
Mueller's face?
He thinks you saved his life!

14:16.855 --> 14:20.067
[Trajectory]
Bet he's packing his bags
as we speak.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.194
[Trajectory and Everyman
laughing]

14:30.160 --> 14:32.621
Good. That'll give them
room to work.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.039
Everybody ready?

14:34.123 --> 14:36.083
<i>Sgowogort egreme!</i>

14:37.334 --> 14:38.794
[Trogowogs screeching
and giggling]

14:39.712 --> 14:40.921
[thuds]

14:41.505 --> 14:43.007
[grunts]

14:43.090 --> 14:44.091
[giggles]

14:46.385 --> 14:47.469
[groans]

14:51.056 --> 14:52.224
[clanking]

14:54.393 --> 14:56.186
Great job, everyone!

14:56.270 --> 14:58.606
<i>Etativel!</i>

14:58.689 --> 15:02.276
You did almost as well
as my students.

15:02.359 --> 15:07.197
If you rebuild that bus for us,
we'll give you any vehicle
on this lot.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.449
[Trogowogs giggling]

15:08.532 --> 15:09.992
[whispering]

15:10.075 --> 15:11.327
[indistinct]

15:11.410 --> 15:13.537
[giggling]

15:13.621 --> 15:15.080
-Deal!
-Hey, that's mine!

15:15.164 --> 15:16.957
I'm not Bruce Wayne, you know?

15:17.041 --> 15:18.626
Nah-ah. Uh-uh.

15:18.709 --> 15:21.211
We'll throw in one full bag of
Freeze-Dried Chicken Whizees!

15:21.295 --> 15:23.255
I was saving those
for the Zone!

15:23.339 --> 15:25.090
[giggling and squealing]

15:25.174 --> 15:27.176
Not until you're done.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.765
And this will really work?

15:32.848 --> 15:34.308
[objects clattering]

15:36.769 --> 15:38.020
Thank you, Andie.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.271
-[Victor] Yeah thanks.
-[Beast Boy] Good share.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.231
[Lia] Good share, proud of ya.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.651
Garfield, we haven't
heard from you.

15:43.734 --> 15:47.863
Anything you'd like
to share... or, anyone?

15:47.946 --> 15:51.367
This little guy is my new
emotional support dog, Wingman.

15:51.450 --> 15:55.371
I named him after, well...
Wingman: the Crimson
Avenger's sidekick,

15:55.454 --> 15:58.374
the very first
superhero sidekick!

15:58.457 --> 16:00.084
<i>Yeah, we take care</i>
<i>of each other.</i>

16:00.167 --> 16:03.253
<i>I give him food. He gives me</i>
<i>unconditional love.</i>

16:03.337 --> 16:05.673
<i>We take walks together</i>
<i>so he can do his business.</i>

16:05.756 --> 16:08.842
<i>Don't worry, I still do my</i>
<i>business in actual bathrooms.</i>

16:08.926 --> 16:10.719
<i>But, it gets me</i>
<i>out of the house,</i>

16:10.803 --> 16:12.262
<i>puts me on</i>
<i>a consistent schedule.</i>

16:12.346 --> 16:13.722
[both playfully barking]

16:16.141 --> 16:17.768
Ha, ha!

16:17.851 --> 16:21.230
I've been sleeping
a little better.
Fewer nightmares. No pills.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.024
Well, you know, except for
my prescribed antidepressants.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.567
That's great, Gar.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.486
Who knew a little dog
could have such a big effect?

16:27.569 --> 16:28.821
Wingman's just part of it.

16:28.904 --> 16:30.447
I'm doing the work
to get better.

16:30.531 --> 16:33.742
What about your show?
It's pretty lame without you.

16:33.826 --> 16:37.371
Don't know if I'll go back,
or if it'll even be my choice.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.081
But... [inhales deeply]

16:39.164 --> 16:41.834
I know I'm not ready
for that or the Outsiders
right now.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.919
What about the people
in your life?

16:44.002 --> 16:46.213
M'gann and I have talked...
a lot.

16:46.296 --> 16:47.840
It's been good.

16:47.923 --> 16:50.551
Everyone's been
really forgiving
of my prior jerkitude.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.845
Mostly, they're just glad
I'm getting help.

16:52.928 --> 16:53.971
Booyah!

16:54.054 --> 16:55.305
And Perdita?

16:55.389 --> 16:57.433
[Beast Boy]
I... I haven't gone there yet.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.102
I really messed that up.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.145
It's scary.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.606
[gasping]

17:04.690 --> 17:06.400
She wanted me
to leave with her.

17:06.483 --> 17:09.737
Leave? Leave the cave?
The Fort?

17:09.820 --> 17:11.238
Leave the Phantom Zone.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.615
She can get us out?

17:13.699 --> 17:14.867
She thinks she can.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.077
But she won't take you.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.705
She hates you.
Called you a tyrant.

17:20.539 --> 17:21.540
Seize her.

17:21.623 --> 17:22.833
[gasping nervously]

17:22.916 --> 17:24.668
Please, come with me.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.045
Neither of us is abandoning
the General.

17:27.129 --> 17:28.922
We serve at his command.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.175
You will kneel before Zod.

17:32.509 --> 17:33.510
I won't.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.013
I can't.

17:36.096 --> 17:37.514
[breathes heavily]

17:37.598 --> 17:38.682
I'm sorry.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.189
[screaming]

17:58.410 --> 17:59.495
[sighs]

18:01.663 --> 18:02.831
[loud boom]

18:05.501 --> 18:06.460
[chuckles]

18:07.169 --> 18:08.462
[boomtube closes]

18:09.755 --> 18:11.965
I know I'm not
supposed to be here.

18:12.049 --> 18:15.719
But you wouldn't answer
my texts, so I felt
I had to try.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.388
I'm glad you did!

18:18.472 --> 18:19.598
I've missed you.

18:19.681 --> 18:21.517
I'm only now realizing
how much.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.561
If you missed me,
why cut yourself off from me?

18:24.645 --> 18:26.563
From your siblings?
From everyone?

18:26.647 --> 18:29.107
I had to prove I made
the right choice.

18:29.191 --> 18:32.694
So I've been busy
building something real,
something important.

18:32.778 --> 18:37.699
Something built on
the foundations of an execution
and a coup?

18:37.783 --> 18:40.285
I'm not saying
I don't have regrets.

18:40.369 --> 18:43.789
All the more reason why
I need to make something good

18:43.872 --> 18:46.291
come out of the ashes
of a year ago.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.877
You don't have to
do that alone.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.088
There are people who love you

18:51.171 --> 18:53.382
and could help you,
if you let them.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.301
Is that why you came?

18:56.385 --> 18:57.886
To fix me?

18:57.970 --> 19:01.849
No. I came to see
if there's anything
still between us.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.893
I'm no longer
a damaged Motherbox,

19:04.977 --> 19:07.896
fixated on fixing everything.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.439
I'm more than that now.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.149
You always were.

19:11.233 --> 19:14.153
[voice quivering]
Because you helped me discover
who I am inside.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.238
For me, that journey
has continued,

19:16.321 --> 19:19.449
and it hurts that you
haven't been part of it.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.286
Shouldn't we walk
these paths together?

19:22.369 --> 19:24.538
I... would like that, Violet.

19:24.621 --> 19:27.249
But we both know
it's not that simple.

19:28.625 --> 19:32.170
Nothing about being human
is ever simple, Brion.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.884
I heard a Boomtube
Are you all right, Karalis?

19:37.634 --> 19:38.760
This is her!

19:38.844 --> 19:41.013
The woman you asked
to be your queen.

19:41.096 --> 19:42.264
How wonderful!

19:42.347 --> 19:44.558
Has she come to accept
your proposal?

19:44.641 --> 19:46.268
They have absolutely not!

19:46.351 --> 19:47.769
Then why are you here?

19:47.853 --> 19:49.313
To get me to leave with you?

19:49.396 --> 19:51.773
Do you expect me
to abandon my country?

19:51.857 --> 19:54.318
I don't know why
I expected anything from you!

19:54.401 --> 19:56.987
I have continued my journey.
But you are stuck

19:57.070 --> 19:58.989
in the same place
I left you a year ago!

19:59.072 --> 20:00.824
You didn't leave me.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.284
I kicked you out.

20:02.367 --> 20:05.245
Then I'll save you the trouble
of doing it again.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.330
[Brion grunts]

20:10.876 --> 20:12.502
[exhales]

20:12.586 --> 20:15.672
My King, I know
the ways of the heart
can be challenging.

20:15.756 --> 20:16.632
Ambassador.

20:17.633 --> 20:18.467
Leave.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.469
Now.

20:20.552 --> 20:21.428
Of course.

20:27.643 --> 20:28.685
[bird cooing]

20:32.147 --> 20:34.816
If you're waiting for them
to give you advice,

20:34.900 --> 20:36.485
you may be here awhile.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.694
[chuckles]

20:37.778 --> 20:39.738
Heavy is the head
that wears the crown.

20:39.821 --> 20:41.156
I'll bet.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.700
It must feel like everyone
wants a piece of you.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.703
What is it you want, Fury?

20:46.787 --> 20:48.330
Please, call me Rosa.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.791
And I was going to ask you
the same thing.

20:50.874 --> 20:53.126
You look like
you could use a friend.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.253
I know I could.

20:55.337 --> 20:58.215
Someone I can talk to.
Someone I can confide in.

20:58.298 --> 21:00.509
-I could use that too, but--
-Listen.

21:00.592 --> 21:03.095
I know you have
no reason to trust me.

21:03.178 --> 21:06.431
So... Let me lay
all my sins before you.

21:06.515 --> 21:09.184
I've done things
I'm not proud of.

21:09.267 --> 21:12.312
First, for Luthor
under a Control Chip.

21:12.396 --> 21:15.232
Then for Trajectory and Baazovi
without one.

21:15.315 --> 21:19.486
More than that,
I've been told things
I'm no longer sure of.

21:19.569 --> 21:24.241
I have to say, I do not
like the looks of this.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.535
Tell me about it.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.454
And I mean that literally.

21:37.045 --> 21:37.963
[button beeps]

21:38.046 --> 21:39.006
[ringing]

21:41.258 --> 21:42.968
[Harper]<i> Hello? Vi?</i>

21:43.051 --> 21:43.927
Harper!

21:44.886 --> 21:47.014
Can I see you?

21:49.725 --> 21:51.059
[Trogowogs giggling
and cackling]

21:53.437 --> 21:55.230
[Kaldur'ahm] Amazing!

21:55.313 --> 21:56.732
What did you call
these creatures?

21:56.815 --> 21:58.150
Trogowogs.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.943
But over the centuries,
they've had many names.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.404
During World War II,
they were called Gremlins.

22:02.487 --> 22:06.283
They favor tearing
new things apart over putting
old things back together.

22:06.366 --> 22:07.701
But as you can see...

22:07.784 --> 22:09.286
-[engine revving]
-their skills work both ways.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.164
Ta da!

22:12.247 --> 22:13.957
[Tigress] From crushed
to crushing it.

22:14.041 --> 22:14.916
Not bad.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.044
All yours!

22:17.127 --> 22:18.253
[cackling and giggling]

22:21.715 --> 22:23.008
Woo hoo!

22:23.091 --> 22:24.551
[sarcastically]
Hope you enjoy them.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.179
-Aah!
-Ooh!

22:33.060 --> 22:35.270
Ah! No joyriding in this realm.

22:35.353 --> 22:37.272
And you really
should wear seat belts.

22:37.355 --> 22:38.440
Bleh.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.567
<i>Sgowogort, nruter ot eht Htrae!</i>

22:40.650 --> 22:42.152
[Trogowogs in unison] Aww!

22:44.112 --> 22:45.947
So we're really doing this.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.240
And without M'gann?

22:47.324 --> 22:50.118
[sighs] I hate keeping secrets.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.120
But we can't get her hopes up.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.581
If we're wrong, or if
this doesn't work,

22:54.664 --> 22:56.249
I think it would kill her.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.045
All aboard.

23:03.924 --> 23:05.592
[engine turns off]

23:05.675 --> 23:06.718
[belts power up]

23:14.142 --> 23:15.519
Feeding you my power.

23:16.394 --> 23:17.270
Thank you.

23:17.354 --> 23:19.189
[inhales and exhales]

23:20.273 --> 23:21.942
<i>Mutrap a latrop!</i>

23:24.277 --> 23:25.862
[metallic screeching]

23:25.946 --> 23:26.863
[door thuds]

23:27.906 --> 23:30.242
Next stop, the Phantom Zone.

23:43.755 --> 23:44.589
[ship horn blaring]

23:44.673 --> 23:46.424
[water splashing]

23:46.508 --> 23:48.051
[Catherine Cobert] And with no
further ado, allow me
to introduce

23:48.135 --> 23:50.512
Justice League Chairman,
Black Lightning,

23:50.595 --> 23:54.307
-and United Nations
Secretary General Troia.
-[audience applauding]

23:54.391 --> 23:56.351
[Black Lightning]
Thank you, Catherine.

23:56.434 --> 23:58.937
The Justice League
is pleased to announce

23:59.020 --> 24:00.772
that the construction
on our brand new

24:00.856 --> 24:04.609
Hall of Justice
is scheduled to begin
this spring,

24:04.693 --> 24:06.862
here, on Justice Island.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.197
[Troia] Right across
from the United Nations,

24:09.281 --> 24:11.366
which welcome the League
as neighbors

24:11.449 --> 24:14.244
and hope this represents
a brand new era

24:14.327 --> 24:17.372
of partnership
between their organization

24:17.455 --> 24:18.748
and ours.

24:18.832 --> 24:20.292
[Black Lightning] And so,
we dedicate this site

24:20.375 --> 24:22.252
to that partnership.

24:22.335 --> 24:24.629
-[Black Lightning] Together?
-[Troia] Together.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.047
[Leroy Bell] It's about time!

24:26.131 --> 24:27.841
[audience cheering]

24:27.924 --> 24:28.925
[Beast Boy] So crash!

24:33.430 --> 24:35.724
[Looker] Ha, ha!
Very asterious!

24:40.228 --> 24:42.606
[La'gaan] Neptune's beard,
that's how it's done!

24:43.523 --> 24:45.817
[Silas Stone] Bravo! Bravo!

24:47.736 --> 24:48.778
[Cyborg] Booyah!
