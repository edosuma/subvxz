00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:06.542 --> 00:08.542
( upbeat pop music playing )

00:11.542 --> 00:14.000
I hate surprises.
I always have.

00:14.041 --> 00:16.291
And surprise parties?
Oh, they're the worst.

00:16.333 --> 00:18.917
They are designed to make
you feel completely unsettled.

00:18.959 --> 00:21.125
Your friends won't talk to you
about birthday plans,

00:21.166 --> 00:23.333
so you think they've forgotten
or just don't care.

00:23.375 --> 00:25.041
And then when you try
to set something up,

00:25.083 --> 00:26.542
suddenly everybody's busy.

00:26.583 --> 00:28.792
And you catch your friends
whispering to each other,

00:28.834 --> 00:31.583
and then they suddenly stop
when you come by. And for what?

00:31.625 --> 00:34.417
So these same friends can gather
in a dark room somewhere

00:34.458 --> 00:35.625
with the sole intention

00:35.667 --> 00:38.041
of scaring
the now totally depressed

00:38.083 --> 00:41.959
and completely paranoid birthday
girl by screaming "surprise"?

00:42.000 --> 00:42.959
I mean, who needs that?

00:43.000 --> 00:44.750
But isn't there a payoff?

00:44.792 --> 00:46.125
You're surrounded by people

00:46.166 --> 00:49.542
who have gathered in your honor
to express their love.

00:49.583 --> 00:52.750
( laughs )

00:52.792 --> 00:57.000
Uh, no. No, that is not how love
is supposed to feel.

00:59.208 --> 01:00.500
Morning, beauty.

01:08.083 --> 01:10.000
( Violet inhales deeply )

01:10.041 --> 01:12.792
What?
You don't have to do that.

01:12.834 --> 01:15.625
Kiss you?
No. Bring me coffee.

01:15.667 --> 01:17.041
You absolutely
have to kiss me.

01:17.083 --> 01:19.834
I also brought you
the real estate section.

01:19.875 --> 01:23.625
I figured you might wanna
start thinking about moving.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.834
There was a guy killed
right there.

01:25.875 --> 01:27.875
Not to mention
the woman who attacked you.

01:27.917 --> 01:29.041
How do you know about that?

01:29.083 --> 01:31.208
I read your book.

01:31.250 --> 01:32.667
I do know how to read.

01:32.709 --> 01:36.208
It's looking, um, good.

01:36.250 --> 01:38.291
Maybe make it better?

01:47.500 --> 01:48.834
Um...

01:48.875 --> 01:50.458
I thought you'd be
at work already.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.041
You're early.

01:52.083 --> 01:54.208
Hey. Did you have fun
with Dad last night?

01:54.250 --> 01:55.208
LUCAS:
Mm-hm.

01:55.250 --> 01:56.625
Yeah.
So do you still want me

01:56.667 --> 02:00.458
to wait for the nanny
or are you gonna stick around?

02:00.500 --> 02:03.583
Oh, right.
Uh, no, you can go. Thanks.

02:04.917 --> 02:07.250
Love you.
I'll see you later.

02:07.291 --> 02:08.709
Have a good day, Dr. Wilder.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.667
The nightmares started

02:13.709 --> 02:16.250
right when he got back
from Afghanistan.

02:16.291 --> 02:19.250
And then
he just stopped sleeping

02:19.291 --> 02:21.667
because I guess
who wants to sleep

02:21.709 --> 02:23.291
when you're always
waking up screaming.

02:23.333 --> 02:25.917
It's common for soldiers
to have problems

02:25.959 --> 02:30.083
turning off the siege mentality
they've been living 24/7.

02:30.125 --> 02:31.667
KELLY:
I was so excited

02:31.709 --> 02:33.291
for his service to be done,

02:33.333 --> 02:38.291
that I could stop worrying about
whether he'd come home alive.

02:38.333 --> 02:39.750
But I did.

02:41.083 --> 02:42.166
So now we can move on.

02:42.208 --> 02:46.917
But we're not,
and you're so distant.

02:46.959 --> 02:49.917
I've tried talking

02:49.959 --> 02:53.291
and I've tried giving him space.

02:53.333 --> 02:55.125
I've even tried
new lingerie.

02:55.166 --> 02:56.375
( sighs )

02:56.417 --> 03:00.500
But sex,
he's just not interested.

03:00.542 --> 03:02.125
Kelly.

03:02.166 --> 03:04.500
I touch you
and you just freeze.

03:04.542 --> 03:08.125
Look, I know what it means
to be a military wife.

03:08.166 --> 03:11.041
My father was a soldier,
got wounded in Vietnam.

03:11.083 --> 03:13.625
And I know that the guys
need help when they come home.

03:13.667 --> 03:16.208
So I read
about couples therapy.

03:16.250 --> 03:19.166
I thought, "What the hell?
It couldn't hurt."

03:19.208 --> 03:22.125
But it doesn't help
if we're not honest.

03:22.166 --> 03:24.041
Sometimes it's useful
to me to see

03:24.083 --> 03:27.333
the husband and wife separately,
as well as together.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.542
It can make it easier
to talk that way.

03:29.583 --> 03:30.959
He won't talk
about anything.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.166
What do you want me to say?
What happened there...

03:35.208 --> 03:36.583
I don't wanna bring it here.

03:36.625 --> 03:39.041
But it is here.

03:39.083 --> 03:40.834
Right between us.

03:42.917 --> 03:47.166
I will do anything to get
us back on track. Please,

03:47.208 --> 03:49.709
just tell me what I can do.

03:59.083 --> 04:01.834
JAKE:
Couldn't call it a better name
than Scientific Assembly

04:01.875 --> 04:03.834
for the College of Obstetrics
and Gynecology?

04:03.875 --> 04:07.875
It's hard to believe the acronym
SACOG isn't sweeping the nation.

04:07.917 --> 04:09.792
You can put your stuff
in my car.

04:09.834 --> 04:12.166
Uh, you know what,
let's take my car.

04:12.208 --> 04:13.417
Why?

04:13.458 --> 04:15.458
Because, you know,
a man drives.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.041
Seriously?

04:17.083 --> 04:20.250
What, I mean, you don't trust
a woman behind the wheel?

04:20.291 --> 04:22.041
No, I'm sure
you're a fantastic driver,

04:22.083 --> 04:23.041
but, you know, it's...

04:23.083 --> 04:24.500
What, I might get the vapors

04:24.542 --> 04:26.041
between here
and Palm Springs?

04:26.083 --> 04:27.250
It's not
a sexist thing, okay?

04:27.291 --> 04:28.458
I'm just old-fashioned.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.250
I was taught
that a man pulls out a chair,

04:30.291 --> 04:32.917
a man opens doors,
and a man drives a woman.

04:32.959 --> 04:35.875
Fine. I don't wanna go
to this thing anyway,

04:35.917 --> 04:38.041
so if it makes you feel better,
you can drive,

04:38.083 --> 04:39.875
but I pick the music.

04:39.917 --> 04:42.000
JAKE:
I got it.

04:46.542 --> 04:48.125
There he is.

04:48.166 --> 04:50.041
Hey. Welcome back, corporal.

04:50.083 --> 04:52.750
Hey, thanks for telling us
about Dr. Wallace.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.083
No problem. No problem.
When are we gonna catch up?

04:55.125 --> 04:57.667
Grab a beer,
watch some hoops?

04:57.709 --> 04:59.667
Yeah, I'm pretty busy right now,
you know.

04:59.709 --> 05:00.750
Okay.

05:00.792 --> 05:02.250
All he does
is mope around the house.

05:02.291 --> 05:04.333
You should just come by.
All right, I'll do that.

05:04.375 --> 05:05.709
Okay.
Good to see you.

05:05.750 --> 05:06.875
You too.
All right.

05:06.917 --> 05:08.458
Take care.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.291
RICK:
Bye.

05:10.333 --> 05:12.667
So you think
you can help them?

05:12.709 --> 05:15.041
I don't know yet. Your friend
isn't much of a talker.

05:15.083 --> 05:17.333
He's always been
a private type of guy.

05:17.375 --> 05:18.667
We worked together at church

05:18.709 --> 05:20.709
on this program
he started for at-risk kids,

05:20.750 --> 05:22.917
but I don't know
if he's a therapy type.

05:22.959 --> 05:24.291
There's no type, Sam.

05:24.333 --> 05:27.083
And Kelly's right,
he does need help.

05:27.125 --> 05:28.917
Well, he did just
get back from the war,

05:28.959 --> 05:31.125
so maybe he just needs some
time. Thanks.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.583
Okay, I can do
two night shifts a week

05:35.625 --> 05:37.291
and a third
every other week.

05:37.333 --> 05:39.917
That way, I'm clear
for my time with Lucas.

05:39.959 --> 05:41.500
So you and Violet
are still...?

05:41.542 --> 05:44.041
Yeah, we needed
this separation.

05:44.083 --> 05:46.125
Is that all it is
or you talking divorce?

05:46.166 --> 05:47.500
PARAMEDIC:
MVA on the 405.

05:47.542 --> 05:49.291
Victim is
a 34-year-old female,

05:49.333 --> 05:50.750
in and out of consciousness,

05:50.792 --> 05:52.959
wasn't able to follow commands
to move her extremities.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.083
PETE: Charlotte, is that...?
Erica.

05:55.125 --> 05:56.792
I need a C-spine,
chest and pelvis,

05:56.834 --> 05:58.333
trauma panel and CT.
NURSE: Got it.

05:58.375 --> 06:00.625
Where's Mason? Was he with her?
He's her son.

06:00.667 --> 06:02.208
PARAMEDIC:
One, two, three.

06:02.250 --> 06:04.041
Mason.

06:04.083 --> 06:05.625
( tense theme playing )

06:05.667 --> 06:08.125
CHARLOTTE: Are you okay?
He's got facial lacerations

06:08.166 --> 06:10.041
from broken glass
and an abrasion on his chest

06:10.083 --> 06:11.834
from the seat belt,
but he's good.

06:11.875 --> 06:13.458
Where's my mom?
I need my mom.

06:21.166 --> 06:23.625
( knocking )

06:23.667 --> 06:26.041
Rick, it's Sam.

06:26.083 --> 06:27.667
I know you're in there.

06:27.709 --> 06:29.917
I see your truck
in the driveway.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.625
Ricky!

06:33.834 --> 06:36.417
Rick. Whoa.

06:36.458 --> 06:38.583
A little early
to be tying one on.

06:38.625 --> 06:40.458
Don't--

06:40.500 --> 06:43.041
( tender theme playing )

06:43.083 --> 06:44.041
Rick.

06:44.083 --> 06:46.500
Damn it.

06:51.083 --> 06:54.041
Yeah. Hello.
This is Dr. Sam Bennett.

06:54.083 --> 06:57.417
I need an ambulance immediately
at 5110 Patrick Henry.

06:57.458 --> 07:00.542
We got a probable overdose,
a 25-year-old male.

07:10.083 --> 07:11.083
Why am I still alive?

07:11.125 --> 07:12.709
Well, I found you in time.

07:12.750 --> 07:13.875
We had to give you charcoal

07:13.917 --> 07:15.667
to absorb all the pills
that you took.

07:15.709 --> 07:18.083
You shouldn't have done that.
SHELDON: You can't go.

07:18.125 --> 07:20.625
You're on psych hold till I can
be sure you won't hurt yourself.

07:20.667 --> 07:21.875
Go to hell.

07:21.917 --> 07:23.458
All right, take it easy.
You can stop me?

07:23.500 --> 07:24.625
All I wanna do is talk.

07:24.667 --> 07:26.458
No, don't touch me!
Hey. All right.

07:26.500 --> 07:27.917
Get off me!
A little help here.

07:27.959 --> 07:28.917
RICK:
Don't!

07:28.959 --> 07:30.834
Haloperidol,
five milligrams, IM now.

07:30.875 --> 07:32.041
Get his arms.

07:32.083 --> 07:34.458
Easy. Okay.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.917
( Rick grunts then sighs )

07:38.792 --> 07:40.041
SAM:
All right.

07:40.083 --> 07:42.875
C-spine is clear.
No fracture or dislocation.

07:42.917 --> 07:44.041
What's her neuro status?

07:44.083 --> 07:45.500
I'm doing a repeat exam now.

07:45.542 --> 07:47.041
What happened? Where am I?

07:47.083 --> 07:48.542
You were in a car accident.

07:48.583 --> 07:49.875
Where's Mason?

07:49.917 --> 07:51.291
MASON:
Mom?

07:52.333 --> 07:54.291
I'm here.

07:54.333 --> 07:56.041
What happened?

07:56.083 --> 07:59.041
She can see you
in a little while, okay?

07:59.083 --> 08:00.625
She has a gliosarcoma.

08:00.667 --> 08:02.125
Could be causing
the disorientation.

08:02.166 --> 08:04.041
Where am I? What happened?

08:04.083 --> 08:07.083
You lost consciousness, Erica.
It's normal to feel confused.

08:07.125 --> 08:10.083
Give her five of lorazepam
before you take her to CT.

08:10.125 --> 08:13.375
Hey. Are you okay?
Does it hurt anywhere?

08:13.417 --> 08:15.709
No. She made me wear a seat belt
and sit in the back.

08:15.750 --> 08:18.709
Okay. What happened?
Do you remember what happened?

08:18.750 --> 08:20.000
We were driving to school

08:20.041 --> 08:21.709
and we were talking
about my book report

08:21.750 --> 08:24.917
and she just fell asleep,
and let go of the wheel.

08:24.959 --> 08:26.792
CHARLOTTE:
Mason, we're gonna take your mom

08:26.834 --> 08:29.125
for some tests.
You stay here with your dad.

08:30.166 --> 08:31.709
Is my mom gonna be okay?

08:31.750 --> 08:33.542
Yeah, yeah.

08:35.083 --> 08:36.125
( sighs )

08:50.166 --> 08:52.041
Kelly's on her way.

08:52.083 --> 08:54.417
I don't wanna see her.

08:54.458 --> 08:56.166
That's fine.
You don't have to.

08:56.208 --> 08:58.041
But you and I,

08:58.083 --> 09:00.834
we're gonna need to talk about
what just happened,

09:00.875 --> 09:02.250
what you tried to do.

09:04.083 --> 09:06.458
I know this is a hard time.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.041
And leaving the familiar
structure of the military

09:10.083 --> 09:12.667
can be disorienting. Especially
when you've been at war.

09:14.083 --> 09:15.875
It wasn't what I expected.

09:15.917 --> 09:18.041
Of course.

09:18.083 --> 09:20.083
No matter what you imagine,

09:21.250 --> 09:24.083
base impulse
just to survive is threatened.

09:24.125 --> 09:27.917
I just wanted it
all to stop.

09:29.083 --> 09:34.041
I kept thinking about
being sent home in a body bag,

09:34.083 --> 09:37.500
how that would
at least be a release.

09:39.250 --> 09:42.041
Wanting to die,
that's not unusual

09:42.083 --> 09:44.000
given the stress
you've been under,

09:44.041 --> 09:45.875
but it becomes
a very serious problem

09:45.917 --> 09:48.834
when you actually try
to take your own life.

09:55.083 --> 09:56.709
Talk about
what you were thinking

09:56.750 --> 09:59.875
when you made the decision
to take those pills.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.709
I signed up
for the fighting.

10:05.125 --> 10:07.250
That's what
I was trained for.

10:07.291 --> 10:08.542
I was prepared for that.

10:09.667 --> 10:13.291
What weren't you
prepared for?

10:13.333 --> 10:15.917
You know, your reaction
when I put my hands on you--

10:15.959 --> 10:17.041
I fought back.

10:17.083 --> 10:20.041
I wasn't trying to hurt you.

10:20.083 --> 10:21.542
You know that, right?

10:24.083 --> 10:25.583
I don't like
being caught off-guard.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.000
When were you
caught off-guard?

10:29.709 --> 10:31.792
Who caught you off-guard?

10:34.709 --> 10:37.041
Was it someone you trusted?

10:37.083 --> 10:39.041
I know
there's hazing in the military.

10:39.083 --> 10:41.875
Were you a victim?
Or a perpetrator?

10:41.917 --> 10:44.041
I would never hurt someone
like that.

10:44.083 --> 10:45.125
Did someone hurt you?

10:46.792 --> 10:48.917
Who was it?

10:51.083 --> 10:53.000
( tense theme playing )

10:54.125 --> 10:56.959
It was my sergeant.

10:58.542 --> 11:00.834
What did he do?

11:00.875 --> 11:02.500
What did he do to you?

11:02.542 --> 11:05.542
Your sergeant,
did he assault you?

11:09.542 --> 11:12.750
He raped me, okay?

11:12.792 --> 11:14.000
My sergeant raped me.

11:23.083 --> 11:26.542
I think we can do without these,
right?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.208
You can't tell anyone.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.000
I won't.

11:37.083 --> 11:39.000
Because this...

11:39.041 --> 11:41.625
My life is over.

11:41.667 --> 11:45.041
No, it's not. I know
you may feel that way, but it...

11:45.083 --> 11:47.625
Look, I don't think you agreed
to couple's counseling

11:47.667 --> 11:49.625
just for Kelly's benefit.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.041
Most soldiers who are serious
about killing themselves,

11:52.083 --> 11:54.125
they use their weapons.

11:54.166 --> 11:58.000
So that makes me think
that you don't wanna die.

11:59.458 --> 12:01.583
You wanna talk,

12:01.625 --> 12:04.000
and I wanna listen.

12:08.083 --> 12:10.625
You said it was your sergeant,
right?

12:11.917 --> 12:14.000
Sergeant Hamill.

12:17.417 --> 12:20.625
He backhanded me
across the jaw.

12:20.667 --> 12:25.000
He knocked my feet out and
then he kicked me to the ground.

12:29.083 --> 12:33.000
He braced one arm
against my neck.

12:35.083 --> 12:39.959
I swear, I thought
he was gonna snap my spine.

12:41.125 --> 12:43.250
I couldn't speak,

12:43.291 --> 12:45.959
I couldn't move.

12:47.083 --> 12:49.667
It didn't seem real.

12:51.458 --> 12:54.208
Until he...

12:54.250 --> 12:59.500
He tore open my uniform
and he jammed himself...

13:01.875 --> 13:04.333
I wish I'd died right then.

13:07.709 --> 13:09.083
You were incredibly brave.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.500
What the hell
are you talking about?

13:16.083 --> 13:18.667
I was weak.
I let him rape me.

13:18.709 --> 13:20.083
No.

13:20.125 --> 13:22.709
He was a psychopath.

13:22.750 --> 13:25.458
And you let yourself live.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.500
( soft theme playing )

13:33.291 --> 13:34.667
Hey, about this morning.

13:34.709 --> 13:37.041
I didn't mean
to make you feel uncomfortable.

13:37.083 --> 13:40.667
Well, it isn't about me.
Lucas almost saw you.

13:40.709 --> 13:43.166
But he didn't.
This time.

13:43.208 --> 13:45.500
Maybe you shouldn't have
your friend over

13:45.542 --> 13:47.083
when you know Lucas
is gonna be there.

13:47.125 --> 13:50.041
First of all, I didn't know that
Scott was gonna be dropping by.

13:50.083 --> 13:52.291
And second of all, seriously?
I know this bothers you--

13:52.333 --> 13:54.333
Just keep him away
from Lucas.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.542
Hey, Pete.

13:57.792 --> 13:59.291
Hey. I just heard about

13:59.333 --> 14:01.041
Mason and Erica.
How are they doing?

14:01.083 --> 14:03.291
Erica has a concussion,
but no serious injuries.

14:03.333 --> 14:05.792
Mason is pretty freaked out

14:05.834 --> 14:08.041
after watching his mother
fall asleep at the wheel.

14:08.083 --> 14:09.959
I'm so sorry. That's awful.
I know.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.417
I'm just trying
to hang on here and...

14:13.750 --> 14:15.208
Are you having
more Pete drama?

14:15.250 --> 14:17.750
Oh, man. It's just silly.
It's nothing, really.

14:17.792 --> 14:20.000
I could use a little silly.
What happened?

14:20.041 --> 14:22.625
Um... This morning,

14:22.667 --> 14:24.625
Pete walked in on me
kissing a guy.

14:24.667 --> 14:26.375
Who's the guy?
Uh--

14:26.417 --> 14:28.583
You know, it's a paramedic.
It's a guy named Scott.

14:28.625 --> 14:30.041
From St. Ambrose?
The young guy?

14:30.083 --> 14:31.041
He's old enough.

14:31.083 --> 14:32.041
That's not what I meant.

14:32.083 --> 14:33.583
He's very handsome.

14:33.625 --> 14:36.041
Does he need a booster seat
in the ambulance

14:36.083 --> 14:38.041
to, like, see over
the steering wheel?

14:38.083 --> 14:39.625
He just-- Sorry.

14:39.667 --> 14:43.000
Pete had Lucas with him when
he walked in on us this morning.

14:43.041 --> 14:44.041
Oh.

14:44.083 --> 14:45.625
I understand Pete
not wanting Lucas

14:45.667 --> 14:48.041
seeing you doing some guy--
I'm not doing him.

14:48.083 --> 14:49.041
I'm-- We're not doing it.

14:49.083 --> 14:52.417
We're just
like fooling around.

14:52.458 --> 14:53.875
It's kind of like
in high school.

14:53.917 --> 14:55.625
When it was
all lips and hands

14:55.667 --> 14:58.041
and swoony, unconsummated--

14:58.083 --> 15:01.625
Okay, okay.
Did Lucas see you?

15:01.667 --> 15:05.041
No.
Then it's Pete's ego talking.

15:05.083 --> 15:07.875
You guys are separated, right?
You get to date other people?

15:07.917 --> 15:09.875
I don't know what
the hard-and-fast rules are.

15:09.917 --> 15:11.041
I mean, what do you think?

15:11.083 --> 15:13.041
Think it's crazy for me
to be seeing somebody

15:13.083 --> 15:14.583
while Pete and I are--

15:14.625 --> 15:16.375
Whatever we are?
If it makes you happy,

15:16.417 --> 15:17.792
I think it's great.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.041
And I think
you should enjoy it.

15:20.083 --> 15:22.625
It's important for Lucas
as an only child

15:22.667 --> 15:24.208
to have someone
to share his toys with.

15:24.250 --> 15:27.000
( laughs )
Oh, my God!

15:28.917 --> 15:32.041
I think I can see your arteries
closing up from here.

15:32.083 --> 15:33.417
Totally worth it.

15:33.458 --> 15:34.834
How can you eat like that?

15:34.875 --> 15:37.417
Just something I do when
I go through a breakup. I eat.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.500
Anything that's not nailed down
goes in my mouth.

15:39.542 --> 15:40.917
I don't know why.

15:40.959 --> 15:42.458
The worse the breakup,
the more I eat.

15:42.500 --> 15:46.834
When my ex-husband left me,
I actively decided to get fat.

15:46.875 --> 15:49.041
That was my only plan.
Pack it on.

15:49.083 --> 15:52.208
Massive fatness like, you know,
rolls on your back,

15:52.250 --> 15:54.542
really big thighs.

15:54.583 --> 15:58.041
I don't know. Like a layer
of protection between me

15:58.083 --> 15:59.875
and the rest of the world.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.083
Ahh. I love that plan.

16:02.125 --> 16:04.959
Well, did it work?
I mean, did you get fat?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.041
No.

16:06.083 --> 16:08.250
I have the metabolism
of a marathon runner.

16:08.291 --> 16:10.875
Disappointing.
But this bacon cheeseburger?

16:10.917 --> 16:13.041
This is a Sam-left-me
bacon cheeseburger

16:13.083 --> 16:15.667
and I plan
on enjoying every bite.

16:15.709 --> 16:17.709
Oh, I hear you.
Breakups are hard.

16:19.083 --> 16:20.250
( laughs )

16:20.291 --> 16:21.500
What?

16:21.542 --> 16:23.875
When has a breakup
been hard for you?

16:23.917 --> 16:26.667
When you're usually the one
doing the dumping, am I wrong?

16:26.709 --> 16:28.166
Who would dump you?
Look at you.

16:28.208 --> 16:29.792
You're the definition
of a catch.

16:29.834 --> 16:31.917
Okay, look, I've never
officially been dumped,

16:31.959 --> 16:34.750
but I've never had a woman
try to get fat for me, either.

16:34.792 --> 16:36.333
So I can't be
that much of a catch.

16:36.375 --> 16:38.917
Hmm.

16:38.959 --> 16:40.000
Maybe not.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.041
Two bedrooms. No, three.

16:44.083 --> 16:47.083
And at least two bathrooms.
Yeah, I--

16:47.125 --> 16:51.917
Look, I want my house,
just not my house.

16:51.959 --> 16:54.375
Okay. Thank you.

16:54.417 --> 16:57.041
Why's it so hard to understand
that I wouldn't wanna live there

16:57.083 --> 17:00.375
after a man was stabbed to death
in my dining room?

17:00.417 --> 17:02.125
( tapping )

17:05.000 --> 17:06.041
Are you okay?

17:06.083 --> 17:08.250
Yeah, yeah.
I just need some advice.

17:10.083 --> 17:12.041
I've been treating
a male soldier

17:12.083 --> 17:14.417
whose sergeant raped him.

17:14.458 --> 17:16.208
He's too ashamed to tell
anybody about it

17:16.250 --> 17:18.041
and he was afraid
if he did speak up,

17:18.083 --> 17:19.750
nobody would believe him.

17:19.792 --> 17:22.041
Well, that's a valid fear.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.166
You don't often think
about men getting raped.

17:24.208 --> 17:26.041
Certainly not soldiers.
Yeah.

17:26.083 --> 17:28.041
I did some digging
and the number of male veterans

17:28.083 --> 17:29.417
who answered "yes" when asked

17:29.458 --> 17:32.041
if they'd been sexually
assaulted or harassed,

17:32.083 --> 17:34.125
it ran into the thousands
just last year.

17:34.166 --> 17:36.667
And it's going up.
That's horrifying.

17:36.709 --> 17:39.250
It's hard to know
how to approach this.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.792
Well, you've treated
rape victims before.

17:41.834 --> 17:42.792
Not men.

17:42.834 --> 17:45.041
Well, rape is rape, Sheldon.
Is it?

17:45.083 --> 17:46.375
You know how hard it is

17:46.417 --> 17:48.667
to get a woman to come forward
after an attack.

17:48.709 --> 17:50.792
Imagine how humiliating it is
for a man.

17:50.834 --> 17:53.041
Let alone
one trained to be a warrior.

17:53.083 --> 17:55.792
Okay. Well, male or female,
the work is the same.

17:55.834 --> 17:57.041
It doesn't feel the same.

17:57.083 --> 17:59.667
I'm not sure
you're doing him any favors

17:59.709 --> 18:01.625
by being overly sensitive
to his gender.

18:01.667 --> 18:03.166
No, gender is central
to the shame

18:03.208 --> 18:04.417
that my patient is feeling.

18:04.458 --> 18:07.041
I mean, he was so overwhelmed
by the attack

18:07.083 --> 18:10.041
that his nervous system
went into a freeze response,

18:10.083 --> 18:12.625
his body shut down.

18:12.667 --> 18:15.041
Now, if a woman responds
this way, most people think

18:15.083 --> 18:17.041
she did what she had to
to make the assault end.

18:17.083 --> 18:19.667
But if a man
doesn't fight back?

18:19.709 --> 18:22.041
He's gonna question whether
or not he's really a man.

18:22.083 --> 18:26.083
And unfortunately, so will
a lot of people around him.

18:26.125 --> 18:28.041
Amelia can't excise the tumor?
No, not this one.

18:28.083 --> 18:29.417
It's too invasive.

18:29.458 --> 18:32.041
Does Mason have any idea?
He knows what he saw.

18:32.083 --> 18:34.250
SAM:
Wait, you didn't explain
the circumstances?

18:34.291 --> 18:37.041
Well, I'm trying to protect him
as long as I can

18:37.083 --> 18:39.291
and Erica
doesn't want him to know.

18:39.333 --> 18:40.875
I know he's just a child,

18:40.917 --> 18:43.250
but I mean, he needs time
to prepare himself for the loss.

18:43.291 --> 18:45.041
But does knowing
that someone is dying

18:45.083 --> 18:47.667
necessarily help you prepare?
I mean, he is a kid.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.500
It might just
make him worry longer.

18:50.750 --> 18:52.667
Cooper, can I have a minute?

18:52.709 --> 18:55.875
They know.
What did Erica's CT scan show?

18:55.917 --> 18:57.375
Uh, the tumor's still growing.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.375
Is that
what caused the accident?

19:00.417 --> 19:02.041
The tumor
precipitated a seizure.

19:02.083 --> 19:04.917
Which is why Mason said
his mom fell asleep.

19:04.959 --> 19:07.291
When she refused the treatment,
Erica knew.

19:07.333 --> 19:10.083
We knew that the symptoms
could increase rapidly.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.291
It's only gonna get worse.

19:13.709 --> 19:15.041
Can you be more specific?

19:15.083 --> 19:18.500
Well, most likely, Erica
only has a few months to live.

19:18.542 --> 19:20.125
But during that time,

19:20.166 --> 19:22.291
as the pressure increases
on her brain,

19:22.333 --> 19:24.291
it's possible
that she could become paralyzed.

19:24.333 --> 19:27.041
She could lose her sight,
she could lose her speech.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.959
I'm sorry, Cooper.

19:31.333 --> 19:33.500
( clicks tongue )

19:33.542 --> 19:36.333
( monitor beeping )

19:39.125 --> 19:40.333
Mason.

19:41.542 --> 19:43.500
Is Mason okay?

19:43.542 --> 19:45.166
He's fine.

19:45.208 --> 19:46.583
Just scared.

19:49.125 --> 19:50.959
And me?
You're bruised

19:51.000 --> 19:54.542
and you have a concussion,
but no serious injuries.

19:54.583 --> 19:56.333
You were both
incredibly lucky.

19:56.375 --> 19:58.333
( sighs )

19:58.375 --> 20:00.417
A car cut us off,
I swerved to get out of the way,

20:00.458 --> 20:02.959
but I just-- I lost control.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.208
COOPER:
Well, that's a lie.

20:04.250 --> 20:06.208
Cooper.
You had a seizure

20:06.250 --> 20:07.417
and you blacked out.

20:07.458 --> 20:09.041
Why are you angry at me?

20:09.083 --> 20:10.834
Because Mason was
in the back seat

20:10.875 --> 20:12.125
and you could have
killed him.

20:12.166 --> 20:13.583
Think I did this on purpose?

20:13.625 --> 20:17.417
Well, you've refused chemo
and now your symptoms are--

20:17.458 --> 20:20.208
Look, you will not drive
Mason anymore.

20:20.250 --> 20:21.875
Don't tell me
what to do with my son.

20:21.917 --> 20:23.041
Look--

20:23.083 --> 20:24.458
I'm the one
who's taking care of him

20:24.500 --> 20:26.250
every day of his life.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.041
You've only been around
five minutes.

20:28.083 --> 20:29.041
And whose fault is that?

20:29.083 --> 20:30.208
Coop.
COOPER: Excuse me.

20:30.250 --> 20:31.792
This is
a terrible situation,

20:31.834 --> 20:34.041
but I cannot let you
make it worse.

20:34.083 --> 20:35.208
So I'm telling you
right now,

20:35.250 --> 20:38.041
if you get behind the wheel
and Mason's in the car,

20:38.083 --> 20:40.041
I will have
your license revoked.

20:40.083 --> 20:42.041
You wanna kill yourself,
that's fine,

20:42.083 --> 20:44.458
but I will not let you
hurt Mason.

20:46.667 --> 20:48.667
( tender theme playing )

20:51.083 --> 20:52.458
I don't understand.

20:53.709 --> 20:57.041
He'll get through this.
Okay? You both will.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.041
Maybe I pushed him too hard.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.875
Maybe we're not
therapy people.

21:01.917 --> 21:03.291
( soft theme playing )

21:03.333 --> 21:07.625
And the sex stuff--
I mean, I can live without that.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.834
I just can't
live without Rick.

21:09.875 --> 21:12.333
No, this--
This wasn't your fault.

21:13.959 --> 21:15.208
Then why did he do it?

21:15.250 --> 21:18.000
Come on.

21:29.583 --> 21:32.542
Hi. Ha-ha.
We're here for the conference.

21:32.583 --> 21:33.875
Dr. Addison Montgomery.

21:33.917 --> 21:34.875
CLERK:
Okay.

21:34.917 --> 21:37.250
Is a king bed acceptable?
Sure.

21:37.291 --> 21:38.875
And your name
to put on the room?

21:38.917 --> 21:40.250
No, no. We're not together.

21:40.291 --> 21:42.041
JAKE:
No, no, we're not together.

21:42.083 --> 21:44.875
But you should have a room
for a Dr. Jake Reilly.

21:44.917 --> 21:46.917
There's a meet and greet
in the ballroom

21:46.959 --> 21:48.667
for all
the conference attendees.

21:48.709 --> 21:49.875
Great.

21:49.917 --> 21:52.875
Okay, then, I will see you
in the ballroom.

21:52.917 --> 21:54.709
I'll see you
in the ballroom.

21:54.750 --> 21:57.041
( soft theme playing )

21:57.083 --> 21:59.959
CLERK:
So you're here alone.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.125
Yes, I am.

22:01.166 --> 22:02.500
( chuckles )

22:07.333 --> 22:08.375
You agreed to see others,

22:08.417 --> 22:10.041
so you don't get
to pick her partner.

22:10.083 --> 22:11.083
I don't want to.

22:11.125 --> 22:12.917
I just want her to be
a little more discreet

22:12.959 --> 22:14.500
when Lucas is around.
I get that.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.709
And have better taste.
You slept with another woman.

22:16.750 --> 22:19.291
There's a difference between
being with someone for one night

22:19.333 --> 22:20.375
who you'll never see again

22:20.417 --> 22:22.041
and dating someone
that I work with,

22:22.083 --> 22:24.291
inviting them into my home.
SAM: Well, Violet's home.

22:24.333 --> 22:25.917
Oh, come on, man.
Whose side are you on?

22:25.959 --> 22:27.709
Sorry. I just know
because I've been there.

22:27.750 --> 22:30.917
It's not easy. But this is
what you wanted, right?

22:30.959 --> 22:33.208
( pensive folk-pop music
playing )

22:34.208 --> 22:37.959
Mm. Another one, please.
Ahem.

22:40.083 --> 22:42.750
Don't judge me.
I wasn't. I'm just--

22:42.792 --> 22:45.000
There's a whole ballroom
full of doctors

22:45.041 --> 22:46.834
across the way there
drinking free drinks.

22:46.875 --> 22:49.041
And you're here alone,
paying.

22:49.083 --> 22:52.000
I do not feel like socializing.
Thank you.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.792
Mm.

22:59.458 --> 23:01.500
Whew.

23:01.542 --> 23:04.041
What?

23:04.083 --> 23:07.000
Are you getting drunk?
No.

23:08.083 --> 23:09.583
Okay. So, what if I am?

23:09.625 --> 23:11.041
We're out of town, no?

23:11.083 --> 23:13.458
At a medical conference.
Nobody knows me here.

23:13.500 --> 23:16.667
You are at a medical conference.
Everyone knows you here.

23:16.709 --> 23:18.083
You're famous here.

23:18.125 --> 23:19.375
You're the--

23:19.417 --> 23:21.375
You're the Meryl Streep
of maternal fetal medicine,

23:21.417 --> 23:23.208
is what you are.

23:23.250 --> 23:24.875
Jake. Go.

23:24.917 --> 23:26.417
Mingle.
Go to that ballroom, okay?

23:26.458 --> 23:28.000
I'm gonna sit here
and I'm gonna drink

23:28.041 --> 23:29.208
because I can't get fat.

23:29.250 --> 23:35.000
All right? And then I'm gonna
crawl up to my bed and I

23:35.041 --> 23:37.166
am gonna miss my boyfriend.

23:37.208 --> 23:39.041
And then tomorrow
I'll be a grown-up

23:39.083 --> 23:40.583
and I will give
my presentation

23:40.625 --> 23:44.041
on the advances
of high-risk perinatology.

23:44.083 --> 23:45.917
Addison.
Mm-mm. Hey!

23:45.959 --> 23:48.709
Go, okay?

23:48.750 --> 23:52.000
Go. Mingle. Come back
when someone's dumped you.

23:53.458 --> 23:55.458
I'm fine.

23:56.959 --> 23:59.458
Right? I'll have another one.
Thank you.

24:01.959 --> 24:03.083
SHELDON:
Hey.

24:03.125 --> 24:04.417
Where's Kelly?

24:04.458 --> 24:06.041
I sent her home.

24:06.083 --> 24:07.291
Did you...?

24:07.333 --> 24:09.083
She doesn't need
to know what happened.

24:09.125 --> 24:10.917
That's your call, but--

24:10.959 --> 24:12.291
But nothing.

24:12.333 --> 24:16.041
How can I tell her?
What good will that do me?

24:16.083 --> 24:18.709
I can help you tell her,
if you want.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.917
Can't you just
help me manage this,

24:20.959 --> 24:23.041
so it doesn't affect me
so much?

24:23.083 --> 24:25.041
Some way I could just forget
what happened?

24:25.083 --> 24:27.500
No, it doesn't work
that way, Rick.

24:27.542 --> 24:30.041
You tried burying it

24:30.083 --> 24:32.667
and that's what
landed you here.

24:32.709 --> 24:34.041
So, what am I
supposed to do?

24:34.083 --> 24:37.041
We can continue
to work together

24:37.083 --> 24:39.959
and you can hide the true nature
of our sessions from Kelly.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.750
Or we can tell her
the truth,

24:41.792 --> 24:44.333
deal with whatever reaction
she has,

24:44.375 --> 24:48.166
and try to rebuild the emotional
intimacy in your marriage.

24:48.208 --> 24:50.750
Neither of those options
sound great.

24:51.834 --> 24:54.542
The process is hard.
But it is worth it.

24:54.583 --> 24:57.333
And I'll help you
whatever way you want.

24:58.959 --> 25:00.000
It's up to you.

25:11.583 --> 25:13.083
( knock on door )

25:13.125 --> 25:14.500
Yeah?

25:14.542 --> 25:16.792
ADDISON:
Room service.

25:26.250 --> 25:28.166
Wanna have sex

25:28.208 --> 25:32.667
with the Meryl Streep
of maternal fetal medicine?

25:35.166 --> 25:36.417
( upbeat rock music playing )

25:36.458 --> 25:37.959
It's okay.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
No, I actually think
that it is not.

25:40.041 --> 25:42.041
You rejected me.
I didn't reject you.

25:42.083 --> 25:45.041
I asked you
to have sex with me

25:45.083 --> 25:46.125
and you said no.

25:46.166 --> 25:48.208
I cannot have sex with you.

25:48.250 --> 25:50.542
Oh! You've just rejected
me again.

25:50.583 --> 25:52.583
Look, I'm sorry.
But I can't.

25:52.625 --> 25:54.750
Am I hideous?

25:54.792 --> 25:57.417
Did I become hideous?
You are gorgeous.

25:57.458 --> 25:59.375
Wait, was it the eating?
Was it all the eating?

25:59.417 --> 26:00.667
Did it freak you out?

26:00.709 --> 26:03.667
Your eating is oddly very sexy.

26:04.709 --> 26:05.834
Is it because you saw

26:05.875 --> 26:07.000
my vagina in a medical way?

26:08.417 --> 26:11.875
Hey, wait.
Don't answer that.

26:13.041 --> 26:16.375
Oh, my God. What am I doing?

26:16.417 --> 26:19.041
I'm losing credibility
all over the place.

26:19.083 --> 26:21.041
All right. Okay.
This is just--

26:21.083 --> 26:22.792
Look, I take it back. Okay?

26:22.834 --> 26:24.583
I don't even wanna have sex
with you, all right?

26:24.625 --> 26:26.375
You're just--

26:26.417 --> 26:28.625
This didn't happen.
I'm going.

26:28.667 --> 26:32.625
Addison. Addison. Just listen
to me, okay? Listen to me.

26:32.667 --> 26:35.041
I can't have sex with you
and I'm really sorry about that.

26:35.083 --> 26:37.041
Why not?
Because you're drunk

26:37.083 --> 26:39.709
and because you don't
wanna have sex with me.

26:39.750 --> 26:41.875
You wanna have sex
with someone.

26:41.917 --> 26:45.041
Anyone.
Because you're not over Sam.

26:45.083 --> 26:48.041
And you're trying
to numb the pain.

26:48.083 --> 26:51.625
You are beautiful
and you are desirable

26:51.667 --> 26:55.625
and very, very hot.
But I can't have sex with you

26:55.667 --> 26:57.208
because you're not ready
to have sex

26:57.250 --> 26:58.875
with anyone who isn't Sam.

27:02.750 --> 27:04.166
Mm.

27:07.083 --> 27:08.667
But it's also just
a little bit

27:08.709 --> 27:12.250
because you saw my vagina
in a medical way?

27:12.291 --> 27:14.000
A little bit.

27:16.709 --> 27:17.917
Mm.

27:21.500 --> 27:23.041
She never should've been
in a car herself,

27:23.083 --> 27:25.458
let alone with Mason,
given what's going on.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.458
I know I'm sounding harsh,
but what she did?

27:27.500 --> 27:29.083
I have every right
to be furious.

27:29.125 --> 27:31.041
I get the accident
was upsetting.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.041
No, no, I need you to tell me
that I'm not wrong

27:33.083 --> 27:34.667
because I'm prone
to feeling guilty.

27:34.709 --> 27:38.750
It's actually in my DNA.
But here, in this situation--

27:38.792 --> 27:40.041
She could have killed
my son.

27:40.083 --> 27:41.917
Yes, but thank God,
they're both okay.

27:41.959 --> 27:45.083
It was sheer luck. She had
a seizure behind the wheel.

27:45.125 --> 27:46.291
I said, "You're done driving.

27:46.333 --> 27:47.375
That's it!"
Cooper.

27:47.417 --> 27:49.500
I'm not gonna tell you
not to feel angry.

27:49.542 --> 27:51.041
It's an appropriate response

27:51.083 --> 27:52.041
to what's going on.

27:52.083 --> 27:54.542
But you have to realize
that the anger--

27:54.583 --> 27:56.375
It's not just about
the car accident.

27:56.417 --> 27:58.917
Even if Erica never got behind
the wheel of a car again,

27:58.959 --> 28:00.583
I don't think
that'd make you feel better.

28:00.625 --> 28:02.333
As long as Mason is safe,
I'm fine.

28:02.375 --> 28:04.291
I don't think so.
What you're angry about

28:04.333 --> 28:05.917
is much bigger
than Mason's safety.

28:05.959 --> 28:08.083
Yeah, I'm angry
that Erica is irresponsible.

28:08.125 --> 28:11.959
No, you're angry
that Erica is dying.

28:13.083 --> 28:16.333
And that's gonna be a much
harder thing to work through.

28:16.375 --> 28:18.375
( tender theme playing )

28:20.875 --> 28:26.041
My commanding officer, uh,

28:26.083 --> 28:27.375
he assaulted me.

28:29.083 --> 28:30.375
He hit you?

28:30.417 --> 28:32.458
( sighs )

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
He raped me.

28:40.875 --> 28:42.458
What are you talking about?

28:42.500 --> 28:46.041
Were there people there
to--?

28:46.083 --> 28:47.458
Were they holding you down?

28:47.500 --> 28:51.417
No, it wasn't like that.
It was just me and him.

28:51.458 --> 28:55.041
But how is that even possible?
You're a soldier.

28:55.083 --> 28:59.041
He was too.
There wasn't a gang or...?

28:59.083 --> 29:03.041
It wasn't some type of hazing
or something?

29:03.083 --> 29:06.375
Are you trying to tell me
that you're gay?

29:06.417 --> 29:08.000
No, he attacked me!

29:08.041 --> 29:10.041
KELLY:
Because I've heard

29:10.083 --> 29:12.041
about men who like other men

29:12.083 --> 29:13.208
and they just don't know

29:13.250 --> 29:15.250
how to tell their wives.
That's not what happened.

29:15.291 --> 29:17.250
Then why didn't you
stop him?

29:17.291 --> 29:19.000
( tense theme playing )

29:28.083 --> 29:29.667
She needs time to process.

29:29.709 --> 29:31.625
Time won't matter.

29:31.667 --> 29:34.000
She said exactly
what I've been thinking myself.

29:42.667 --> 29:44.041
Oh, my God.

29:44.083 --> 29:46.041
JAKE:
It's okay.

29:46.083 --> 29:48.208
Oh, my God.
It's okay.

29:48.250 --> 29:49.875
( gasps )

29:49.917 --> 29:53.250
Oh, crap.
I'm late for my presentation.

29:53.291 --> 29:56.458
I had them move you to 4 p.m.
You've got three more hours.

29:56.500 --> 29:59.041
( sighs )

29:59.083 --> 30:01.125
Oh.

30:01.166 --> 30:03.125
Did I ask you for sex
and then cry?

30:03.166 --> 30:05.291
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

30:07.166 --> 30:09.041
Okay. I, uh--

30:09.083 --> 30:10.709
I'm so sorry.

30:10.750 --> 30:15.083
I had a lot to drink last night
and it was a bad idea

30:15.125 --> 30:17.667
and my sad just sort of came out
all over you.

30:17.709 --> 30:20.041
I am so, so, so sorry.

30:20.083 --> 30:22.917
It's okay.
No, it's really not.

30:22.959 --> 30:26.083
I feel like I'm always
a mess around you

30:26.125 --> 30:27.291
and it's not good, you know?

30:27.333 --> 30:29.542
We're colleagues.
I'm not this person.

30:29.583 --> 30:30.917
Seriously, I'm not.

30:30.959 --> 30:32.542
We're not gonna talk
about this anymore.

30:32.583 --> 30:35.041
I called room service,
got you a bacon cheeseburger.

30:35.083 --> 30:37.041
It got here five minutes ago.
It's still hot.

30:37.083 --> 30:38.041
Okay, but I--

30:38.083 --> 30:39.291
We're not gonna
talk about this.

30:39.333 --> 30:41.959
Go. Sit. Eat.

30:52.333 --> 30:54.125
I'm supposed to
just do everything you say?

30:54.166 --> 30:56.041
I'm driving.

30:56.083 --> 30:58.041
Eat.

31:01.542 --> 31:04.208
We're not just colleagues.

31:04.250 --> 31:06.792
( slow reggae-pop music
playing )

31:13.417 --> 31:15.041
Hey, Dr. Wilder.

31:15.083 --> 31:16.834
Save it.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.625
Don't, um--

31:18.667 --> 31:20.375
Don't be like that.

31:21.875 --> 31:24.041
You were kissing my wife.
Former wife.

31:24.083 --> 31:28.208
You guys are separated
and I'm not trying to be a jerk.

31:28.250 --> 31:30.000
You know, just shut up.

31:30.041 --> 31:33.458
And know that
if you hurt her

31:33.500 --> 31:36.041
or if you fool around with her
in front of my son--

31:36.083 --> 31:39.208
Then, what?

31:44.041 --> 31:46.208
Yeah. That's what I thought.

31:46.250 --> 31:47.208
CHARLOTTE:
Hey there.

31:47.250 --> 31:48.458
ERICA:
Hey.

31:49.709 --> 31:51.667
( Erica sighs )

31:51.709 --> 31:55.583
So does he stay mad
a long time?

31:55.625 --> 31:57.458
Your husband?

31:57.500 --> 32:00.542
Not as long as I usually do.

32:00.583 --> 32:02.875
But he is fierce about Mason.

32:02.917 --> 32:04.041
( knock on door )

32:04.083 --> 32:06.041
Hey. Somebody would
like to see you.

32:06.083 --> 32:07.333
Oh, baby.

32:12.083 --> 32:14.667
Thank you for bringing him.

32:14.709 --> 32:17.291
I'm so sorry I scared you.

32:17.333 --> 32:20.083
When can we go home?

32:20.125 --> 32:21.208
Soon.

32:21.250 --> 32:23.625
Mommy's feeling much better.

32:23.667 --> 32:27.041
We just have to watch your mom
a day or two longer.

32:27.083 --> 32:31.041
And you can stay
with me and Charlotte, okay?

32:31.083 --> 32:34.041
And you can play
as many video games as you want.

32:34.083 --> 32:35.333
MASON:
I wish you could play too.

32:35.375 --> 32:36.500
( Erica laughs )

32:38.500 --> 32:40.041
( Erica gasping )

32:40.083 --> 32:41.917
( monitor beeping rapidly )

32:41.959 --> 32:43.875
MASON:
Mom. Mom.

32:43.917 --> 32:45.333
Cooper, get him out of here.

32:45.375 --> 32:46.875
COOPER:
Mason, come on. It's okay.

32:46.917 --> 32:48.458
Come on. Come on. Come on.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.750
( grunting )

32:56.709 --> 32:59.041
First he sees his mother
fall asleep

32:59.083 --> 33:01.208
while she's driving him and
then he tries to give her a hug

33:01.250 --> 33:02.709
and she has a seizure.

33:02.750 --> 33:04.041
Coop, I get
that you're mad--

33:04.083 --> 33:06.709
Oh, please, spare me
the lecture, okay?

33:06.750 --> 33:08.041
Violet gave it to me.

33:08.083 --> 33:10.125
I know what stage of grief
I'm in and it doesn't help.

33:10.166 --> 33:12.000
I'm not trying to lecture you.
Good.

33:12.041 --> 33:14.500
Because my son is being hurt

33:14.542 --> 33:17.083
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

33:17.125 --> 33:20.041
I'm not sure that's true.

33:20.083 --> 33:22.291
Look, you can be angry

33:22.333 --> 33:25.709
and sad and frustrated
and a hundred other things.

33:25.750 --> 33:27.041
I don't blame you.

33:27.083 --> 33:29.750
Because there's no easy way
to deal with this.

33:29.792 --> 33:32.291
There is a hard way
to deal with it.

33:32.333 --> 33:34.041
Erica can try to fight.

33:34.083 --> 33:35.792
She may not be successful,

33:35.834 --> 33:40.041
but she could do it
with our help.

33:40.083 --> 33:42.208
I tried.
You demanded.

33:42.250 --> 33:43.750
But you have to remember,

33:43.792 --> 33:47.125
Erica is angry and sad
and frustrated too.

33:47.166 --> 33:49.750
And maybe what she needs right
now isn't someone telling her

33:49.792 --> 33:51.166
that she has to fight
this fight.

33:52.166 --> 33:53.333
Maybe what she needs is

33:53.375 --> 33:54.834
someone helping
her understand

33:54.875 --> 33:57.000
why she should fight it.

33:58.417 --> 33:59.792
KELLY:
He just--

34:01.250 --> 34:02.750
He let it happen.

34:02.792 --> 34:04.625
He didn't let it happen.

34:04.667 --> 34:08.000
Your husband is a survivor
of a sexual assault.

34:10.250 --> 34:14.625
The first time that I saw Rick,
he was on leave,

34:14.667 --> 34:17.583
visiting some high school
buddies and--

34:17.625 --> 34:23.041
I went to this dive bar
with a couple girlfriends

34:23.083 --> 34:25.625
and it had a great jukebox.

34:25.667 --> 34:30.000
And Rick was feeding
every quarter he had into it.

34:31.083 --> 34:35.000
And when
he introduced himself,

34:35.041 --> 34:40.000
he said, "I can't dance,
but for you, I would try."

34:41.417 --> 34:44.667
And when I took his hand,
I thought:

34:44.709 --> 34:47.625
"This man would never
let anything bad happen.

34:49.458 --> 34:52.125
This man would
keep me safe."

34:53.875 --> 34:55.208
That man is gone.

34:55.250 --> 34:57.250
( soft theme playing )

34:59.083 --> 35:03.500
I know that all this
must be a shock to you.

35:03.542 --> 35:07.083
And please forgive me
for even bringing this up,

35:07.125 --> 35:12.250
but if you had been raped
and Rick were to blame you...

35:15.750 --> 35:18.333
When I look at him now,

35:19.750 --> 35:22.291
I don't feel the same.

35:23.917 --> 35:27.000
And I know
how bad that sounds.

35:29.583 --> 35:32.000
I just don't know
what to do.

35:33.542 --> 35:36.041
Didn't you tell me your father
was wounded in Vietnam?

35:36.083 --> 35:40.041
Yeah. He lost his right leg
below the knee.

35:40.083 --> 35:44.500
Well, Rick was wounded
in Afghanistan.

35:45.750 --> 35:49.083
His injury may not be
as visible as your father's,

35:49.125 --> 35:51.333
but it's just as real.

35:53.125 --> 35:56.000
Don't blame him for something
that wasn't his fault.

36:00.041 --> 36:02.041
JAKE:
I was impressed.

36:02.083 --> 36:03.709
I mean, if I had been
that hung-over,

36:03.750 --> 36:07.000
I don't think I could have given
such a focused presentation.

36:07.041 --> 36:10.500
No, I was driven
by shame and humiliation.

36:10.542 --> 36:12.500
Also, the fact
that you promised

36:12.542 --> 36:15.000
we'd stop for another burger
on the way home.

36:15.041 --> 36:17.083
Oh, is that right?
Yeah.

36:17.125 --> 36:20.542
I don't remember that part,
but okay.

36:23.417 --> 36:25.333
Thank you.

36:26.625 --> 36:30.792
For being so amazing last night.
I really...

36:30.834 --> 36:34.542
I appreciate it.
No problem.

36:34.583 --> 36:37.041
And you're wrong, you know.

36:37.083 --> 36:39.542
What?
I've been dumped before.

36:39.583 --> 36:41.041
When I was
on that plane to Fiji

36:41.083 --> 36:42.625
and you weren't in
that seat next to me.

36:42.667 --> 36:45.417
You didn't even wind up going.
Still felt like getting dumped.

36:45.458 --> 36:47.125
It felt like you dumped me.
Jake.

36:47.166 --> 36:49.792
No, I'm just saying,
if someday I get drunk

36:49.834 --> 36:51.417
and show up
on your doorstep,

36:51.458 --> 36:55.166
fat from bacon cheeseburgers
and demanding sex, look out.

36:57.083 --> 37:00.083
( both laugh )

37:03.083 --> 37:04.500
What?

37:07.750 --> 37:08.834
What?

37:08.875 --> 37:11.625
I don't want you
seeing Scott anymore.

37:13.250 --> 37:16.041
That's not really your call.
It is when it affects Lucas.

37:16.083 --> 37:18.000
That's not
what's really bothering you.

37:18.041 --> 37:20.166
Ha. I just love it

37:20.208 --> 37:22.041
when you tell me
what I'm really thinking.

37:22.083 --> 37:23.583
You know what? You left me.

37:23.625 --> 37:27.375
Do you even understand that?
You left me, Pete.

37:27.417 --> 37:30.166
I asked you-- I practically
begged you to stop me

37:30.208 --> 37:32.041
from walking out that door,
but you didn't.

37:32.083 --> 37:35.041
You didn't do a damn thing.
You let me go!

37:35.083 --> 37:38.041
And now you have the audacity,
you have the gall to tell me

37:38.083 --> 37:39.291
that I can't see
someone else?

37:39.333 --> 37:41.417
Fine. Do whatever you want.
I don't care anymore.

37:41.458 --> 37:43.625
You didn't care then.
Why should now be different?

37:43.667 --> 37:44.834
Got to hell, Violet.

37:44.875 --> 37:46.875
( tender theme playing )

37:48.917 --> 37:51.291
I wanna go home.

37:53.083 --> 37:55.417
Let's see how it goes today.

37:55.458 --> 37:58.041
I don't think
Kelly will be there.

37:58.083 --> 38:01.000
She hasn't returned
any of my calls.

38:02.542 --> 38:05.041
I know that's disappointing.

38:05.083 --> 38:09.750
But even if that's the case,
telling her the way you did?

38:09.792 --> 38:10.959
You should be very proud.

38:12.083 --> 38:15.000
Your life still has value,
Rick.

38:23.291 --> 38:24.375
Hey.

38:26.375 --> 38:29.375
( soft theme playing )

38:50.375 --> 38:51.917
You feeling any better?

38:51.959 --> 38:53.375
ERICA:
Yeah.

38:55.375 --> 38:59.291
This whole thing
has been terrifying.

38:59.333 --> 39:01.375
Yeah.
There's no way out.

39:01.417 --> 39:03.792
I can't make it better
and I can't make it easier

39:03.834 --> 39:07.166
and I'm just...stuck

39:07.208 --> 39:09.000
in the worst possible place.

39:10.750 --> 39:12.750
It is a...

39:13.834 --> 39:18.333
terrible situation
for a lot of different reasons.

39:19.417 --> 39:21.125
And look, even though

39:21.166 --> 39:23.333
it doesn't take anywhere
near the amount of courage

39:23.375 --> 39:26.166
for me to ask you this
as it does for you to say yes--

39:26.208 --> 39:28.750
Cooper.
Fight.

39:28.792 --> 39:32.000
Please, Erica. Please fight.

39:33.583 --> 39:38.792
Look, the odds are long
and it's gonna be miserable

39:38.834 --> 39:40.041
and I can't promise you

39:40.083 --> 39:42.041
that you're gonna get
enough extra time

39:42.083 --> 39:44.959
to make the hell
that's chemo or radiation

39:45.000 --> 39:46.750
or whatever they do
to you worth it,

39:46.792 --> 39:48.834
but I can tell you this:

39:48.875 --> 39:51.041
What you're doing now
is not working.

39:52.208 --> 39:54.208
I don't wanna let you go.

39:54.250 --> 39:56.417
I don't think
you're ready to go.

39:56.458 --> 39:58.792
( soft theme playing )

39:58.834 --> 40:00.083
And most importantly...

40:01.500 --> 40:03.041
...maybe we'll get lucky.

40:04.625 --> 40:07.625
Maybe it'll just show Mason
how much you care. Maybe--

40:07.667 --> 40:09.625
I don't know.
I just don't know, Erica.

40:09.667 --> 40:12.667
But please, just fight.

40:17.834 --> 40:19.875
( inaudible dialogue )

40:25.083 --> 40:26.542
Okay.

40:29.250 --> 40:30.750
( sighs )

40:34.917 --> 40:36.417
Hi.
Hi.

40:36.458 --> 40:40.458
Are you okay?
You sounded kind of--

40:40.500 --> 40:42.250
( slow indie-rock music
playing )

40:45.250 --> 40:47.875
Wait a minute.
Is Lucas--? Is--?

40:47.917 --> 40:49.417
He's with his dad.

40:49.458 --> 40:52.667
So Pete's-- He's not here?
No.

40:59.166 --> 41:01.375
( phone ringing )

41:05.917 --> 41:08.000
This is Dr. Sam Bennett.

41:12.500 --> 41:14.041
Wait.
There must be some mistake.

41:14.083 --> 41:16.375
Because I have a--

41:17.709 --> 41:19.709
Okay. Where?

41:22.125 --> 41:24.041
I'll be right there.

41:24.083 --> 41:26.041
I've always been
the kind of person

41:26.083 --> 41:28.041
who reads the last chapter
of the book first.

41:28.083 --> 41:29.291
I like to know
what's coming.

41:29.333 --> 41:31.041
It used to drive Sam crazy.

41:31.083 --> 41:32.500
He'd say to me,
"Getting to the end

41:32.542 --> 41:34.500
is supposed to be
a surprise."

41:34.542 --> 41:36.000
MAN:
It's nice of you to come down.

41:36.041 --> 41:37.542
Most of the people in here?

41:37.583 --> 41:39.291
Nobody shows up
to take them home.

41:39.333 --> 41:40.500
Yeah. Uh...

41:40.542 --> 41:42.041
What was
she arrested for again?

41:42.083 --> 41:45.083
She boosted the cash from
a convenience store register.

41:45.125 --> 41:47.208
Just wait here.
I'll get her.

41:56.625 --> 41:58.417
ADDISON:
I hate surprises.

42:00.083 --> 42:02.000
This is who you came to pick up,
right?

42:02.041 --> 42:04.083
ADDISON:
I like to know.

42:04.125 --> 42:06.208
Uh, yeah.

42:06.250 --> 42:08.125
That's my sister.

42:08.166 --> 42:11.000
I like to know
what's coming.

42:19.375 --> 42:21.375
( upbeat theme playing )
