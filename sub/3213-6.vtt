WEBVTT

00:18.086 --> 00:19.087
Open your mouth.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.154
I don't want to.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.890
Open your mouth.

00:22.923 --> 00:24.725
It's gonna happen, buddy.
Don't fight it.

00:24.758 --> 00:25.859
But I don't feel safe.

00:25.893 --> 00:27.228
Eric...

00:27.261 --> 00:29.430
my darts team has a match
in two hours

00:29.463 --> 00:30.864
and I need
to practice.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.166
Now stop being such
a freakin' baby

00:32.200 --> 00:33.234
and open your mouth.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.268
What if you get one in
and I choke?

00:34.302 --> 00:35.869
Classy problem.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.105
Now open up.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.109
Yes!

00:41.142 --> 00:42.176
ERIC:
Oh...

00:42.210 --> 00:43.677
It was delicious.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.079
My fear actually heightened
my sense of pleasure.

00:45.113 --> 00:47.281
Do another one.

00:47.315 --> 00:48.216
Ooh!
Ooh.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.217
That's all right.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.618
Here you go.
Try another one.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.052
Oh!

00:52.086 --> 00:53.254
Holy crap.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.555
What? That's where
you wanted it, right?

00:54.588 --> 00:55.723
Yeah.

00:55.756 --> 00:56.757
Yeah, just keep going.

00:56.790 --> 00:57.725
CARYN:
Ow!

00:57.758 --> 00:58.726
Right?

00:58.759 --> 01:01.262
Whoa-ho!
Hey, hot stuff!

01:01.295 --> 01:02.630
Mm-mmm.

01:02.663 --> 01:03.964
I have a third date tonight
with that guy Jonah.

01:03.997 --> 01:05.266
And you know
what that means!

01:05.299 --> 01:06.367
That Jonah isn't real.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.901
I wasn't talking to you.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.570
And this one is real!

01:09.603 --> 01:11.439
Hey. How do I look?

01:11.472 --> 01:12.940
Fantastic.

01:12.973 --> 01:14.208
Your bracelet's at war
with your necklace.

01:14.242 --> 01:15.443
Make a choice.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.311
Pull that dress down
and lose the scarf.

01:17.345 --> 01:18.946
Like I care what you think!

01:18.979 --> 01:20.148
(whispers):
Hey.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.750
Is he right?
Yeah.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.252
(sighs)
Hey, by the way,

01:24.285 --> 01:25.319
if any of you guys
are in the mood

01:25.353 --> 01:26.387
to watch some all-girl

01:26.420 --> 01:27.655
dart action tonight,

01:27.688 --> 01:28.956
come by Truck Stop at 10:00.

01:28.989 --> 01:29.990
In.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.759
Sorry, I can't make it.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.561
Got my overnight bag packed.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.563
Who is this guy, anyway?
Oh, my God,

01:35.596 --> 01:37.931
he is this amazing,
successful entrepreneur

01:37.965 --> 01:39.667
that has his very own
transport service.

01:39.700 --> 01:40.901
He sends town cars

01:40.934 --> 01:42.670
and limos all over the city

01:42.703 --> 01:44.238
to pick up VIPs and celebrities.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.339
Taxi!

01:45.373 --> 01:47.141
Have a good night, you guys!

01:52.313 --> 01:54.415
(cheering)

01:54.448 --> 01:55.616
Yes! Yes!

01:55.649 --> 01:56.584
Yes!
That was awesome!

01:56.617 --> 01:57.685
April.

01:57.718 --> 02:00.154
All we need is a 15 or a 16.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.022
So just breathe in...

02:02.055 --> 02:03.591
and visualize
your energy

02:03.624 --> 02:05.159
flowing through your hand.
And remember...
Okay.

02:05.193 --> 02:08.362
the dart
throws itself.

02:08.396 --> 02:09.230
Okay.

02:11.031 --> 02:13.133
What the hell
was that?!

02:13.167 --> 02:14.368
Are you kidding me?!

02:14.402 --> 02:16.136
You said that
that dart throws itself.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.171
And it didn't.

02:17.205 --> 02:19.373
So your problem
really is with the dart.

02:19.407 --> 02:20.774
You didn't even practice
this week, did you?

02:20.808 --> 02:22.343
I'm a doctor.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.178
I do not have time
to throw candy

02:24.212 --> 02:25.979
into people's mouths!

02:26.013 --> 02:27.348
Now just relax.

02:27.381 --> 02:28.316
(grunts)
Have fun.

02:28.349 --> 02:29.783
It's a game.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.219
There you are.

02:31.252 --> 02:34.188
Oh... wow.

02:34.222 --> 02:36.790
Check out all these fine ladies.

02:36.824 --> 02:39.627
And I don't see any dudes
in here to compete with us.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.229
You know, cuz,

02:41.262 --> 02:43.964
I got me a good
feeling about this.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.399
Tonight...

02:45.433 --> 02:48.168
could get interesting.

02:48.202 --> 02:49.203
Indeed it could.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.338
Go get 'em, tiger.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.739
Oh, there's Zara.

02:51.772 --> 02:52.973
I'm gonna go watch the darts.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.108
All right.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.350
Oh. Date's over already?

03:02.383 --> 03:04.285
Guess he was real.
Shut up!

03:05.919 --> 03:07.755
Zara, I need to talk to you.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.257
I need you to move.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.758
I just had the worst
night of my life!

03:10.791 --> 03:12.860
It's going to get a lot
worse if you don't move.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.228
She means it.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.429
Don't learn the hard way.
No, no, no.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.331
She's my roommate. She's
actually very nice at home.

03:17.365 --> 03:20.501
You are far from home,
young one. Very far.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.102
Hey.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.438
How was your night
with... my drink?

03:24.472 --> 03:25.606
Help yourself.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.841
Stosh, please don't
start with me.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.610
I'm very upset right now.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.445
Okay, all right.
I'm-I'm sorry.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.713
Tell me what
happened.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.448
I got lumped.

03:34.482 --> 03:35.416
"Lumped"?

03:37.485 --> 03:38.619
Dumped in the middle
of getting la...

03:38.652 --> 03:39.720
Oh.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.054
Very traumatic.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.391
At least you had
the composure

03:43.424 --> 03:45.426
to give it a
clever nickname.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.795
Come here.
Give me a hug.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.230
Come on,
bring it in.

03:50.264 --> 03:51.899
Come here.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.634
That's it,
that's the stuff.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.304
It's such a humiliating way
to get dumped.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.638
Yeah, you deserve better.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.440
He should have waited.

03:59.473 --> 04:00.508
Thank you.

04:01.475 --> 04:02.376
(cheering)
Yeah!

04:02.410 --> 04:03.277
Oh!

04:03.311 --> 04:04.044
(laughs)

04:04.077 --> 04:05.379
Zara!
(whoops)

04:05.413 --> 04:07.415
I helped her train
for tonight.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.950
Well, you did
an awesome job.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.719
Well, thank you.

04:11.752 --> 04:12.820
(laughs)

04:12.853 --> 04:14.855
Okay.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.632
Oh, God! I know!

04:24.665 --> 04:25.499
I stink!

04:25.533 --> 04:26.767
Well, quit stinking!

04:26.800 --> 04:28.569
Gladly! I quit!
What?!

04:28.602 --> 04:30.471
Yeah.
You can't quit in
the middle of a tournament!

04:30.504 --> 04:33.341
I just did.
Would you quit in the middle
of a surgery?

04:33.374 --> 04:35.609
I would if my patient
was being a dick.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.078
What does that mean?

04:38.111 --> 04:40.748
It means you're a dick.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.183
I don't even know why
I dated this guy.

04:43.216 --> 04:44.952
It's not that he had
a bad personality.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.654
He actually had no personality.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.423
Well, I once dated a girl
with multiple personalities

04:49.457 --> 04:50.591
and they were all were terrible.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.926
But luckily, they all had
an amazing body.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.462
(laughs)

04:54.495 --> 04:55.796
Feel better?

04:55.829 --> 04:58.766
Is the "pain go bye-bye"
juice working?

04:58.799 --> 04:59.800
Yes.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.101
Thank you, Stosh.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.371
You're welcome, Caryn.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.205
APRIL:
Hey.

05:05.238 --> 05:06.374
Hi.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.675
The darts are over?
Oh.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.677
I quit.
Your roommate wasn't even

05:09.710 --> 05:11.512
that much of a bitch
while we were breaking up.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.213
And she slashed
my bicycle tires.

05:13.246 --> 05:14.482
I'm April, by the way.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.983
I'm Caryn.
Stosh.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.485
Do you mind if
I join you guys?

05:17.518 --> 05:19.887
Or is this
a romantic thing?

05:19.920 --> 05:22.456
Um...

05:22.490 --> 05:24.792
No. No, it's not.
No, no, no. No, not at all.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.527
No, no.
No, it's not, it's not, never.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.228
Nothing romantic
at all.
No, absolutely not.

05:28.261 --> 05:29.563
(fake retches) Never.
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no,

05:29.597 --> 05:30.964
no, no, no, no...
Um, and...

05:30.998 --> 05:32.400
...no, no no.
Okay.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.567
APRIL:
All right.

05:33.601 --> 05:34.835
That was a...

05:34.868 --> 05:36.404
very thorough answer.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.071
Next round of
shots on me?

05:40.574 --> 05:42.142
Look, even if I agreed with you

05:42.175 --> 05:43.644
that April is
a festering boil

05:43.677 --> 05:45.813
on the ass of the dart world--
which I don't--

05:45.846 --> 05:47.381
you still need
a partner.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.349
No partner
and you're out of the tourney.

05:49.383 --> 05:50.418
She quit, Becky!

05:50.451 --> 05:51.819
What am I supposed to do?

05:51.852 --> 05:53.487
What about playing with her?

05:53.521 --> 05:54.588
Who?

05:54.622 --> 05:56.557
I don't know her.
BECKY: No.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.425
Your friend.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.393
She seems
super into it.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.863
Oh, that...

06:02.896 --> 06:04.097
Oh.

06:05.433 --> 06:08.268
Oh, you mean Eric... a.

06:08.301 --> 06:09.403
Erica!

06:09.437 --> 06:11.004
That is a great idea.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.073
I will go ask... her.

06:13.974 --> 06:14.942
And, by the way,

06:14.975 --> 06:17.277
her darts name is "Viper."

06:18.546 --> 06:19.780
Hey. Let's dance.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.049
*

06:26.554 --> 06:27.621
To happiness!

06:27.655 --> 06:28.689
Or, as I like
to call it,

06:28.722 --> 06:30.624
"sadness in its
early stages."

06:33.494 --> 06:35.863
Bleh! Scotch.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.531
They should call it crotch!

06:37.565 --> 06:39.533
Hmm-mm.
APRIL:
You know, I had a boyfriend

06:39.567 --> 06:41.201
who lived in Glasgow

06:41.234 --> 06:43.471
and he taught me about all
the different kinds of Scotches.

06:43.504 --> 06:46.807
There is just so much
we can learn from alcoholics.

06:46.840 --> 06:47.975
So, I'm sorry, let's go back.

06:48.008 --> 06:48.976
You said "boyfriend"?

06:49.009 --> 06:50.478
I did.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.780
Okay, so can one assume
that your sexuality

06:52.813 --> 06:54.281
is of the "bi" variety?

06:54.314 --> 06:55.783
APRIL:
No, because I don't

06:55.816 --> 06:57.651
like that word.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.086
I like who I like.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.489
And I think that sexuality
is a very fluid thing,

07:01.522 --> 07:03.123
and I just like
to go with the flow.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.558
So you're bi.
Yes.

07:04.592 --> 07:05.292
Great.
Yeah.

07:05.325 --> 07:06.494
Bartender!

07:06.527 --> 07:08.128
Three more shots
of crotch!

07:08.161 --> 07:09.663
That was my joke.

07:09.697 --> 07:12.165
I wouldn't call
it a joke.

07:16.369 --> 07:19.439
(cheering)

07:19.473 --> 07:20.641
Yes! Yes!

07:20.674 --> 07:21.642
Sweet shot, Viper!

07:21.675 --> 07:22.476
Thank you!

07:22.510 --> 07:24.011
Yeah! You go, girl!

07:24.044 --> 07:26.013
You go, girl.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.081
(laughing)

07:28.115 --> 07:30.350
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
...Terminator,
Aliens...

07:30.383 --> 07:31.752
Do not blow it with this one.

07:31.785 --> 07:32.953
...half of
Titanic.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.655
Half of Titanic?

07:34.688 --> 07:35.756
The Jack and Rose
love story is...

07:35.789 --> 07:37.491
(imitates buzzer)
No, no.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.259
It's the screaming,
it's the ice,

07:39.292 --> 07:40.528
it's the dead people.

07:41.394 --> 07:42.530
Yes!

07:42.563 --> 07:44.665
Okay, what about
When Harry Met Sally?

07:44.698 --> 07:45.699
Oh, give me
a break.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.300
Yes!

07:47.334 --> 07:48.468
I love that movie!

07:50.137 --> 07:51.304
Me, too.

07:51.338 --> 07:52.840
(chanting):
Viper! Viper!

07:52.873 --> 07:55.643
Viper! Viper! Viper!

07:55.676 --> 07:57.310
Viper! Viper!

07:57.344 --> 07:59.379
(cheering)
Yes!

07:59.412 --> 08:01.048
Yes!

08:01.081 --> 08:01.882
Boom!

08:01.915 --> 08:03.283
(shrieking)

08:03.316 --> 08:04.985
That is one badass bitch.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.521
Yeah!
(cheering)

08:08.689 --> 08:11.525
Oh, I was just obsessed
with horses as a kid.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.527
I used to draw horses
all the time.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.362
Did you really? Aw...
Yes.

08:15.395 --> 08:17.064
You know, I-I actually had
a horse when I was a kid.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.498
Really?
You did?

08:18.532 --> 08:19.700
Oh, wow.
What was your
horse's name?

08:20.701 --> 08:21.869
Horst.

08:21.902 --> 08:22.870
Horst?

08:22.903 --> 08:25.706
He was a,
uh, albino.

08:25.739 --> 08:28.075
He was actually sold
to a circus and, um,

08:28.108 --> 08:30.343
he didn't make it.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.145
Heartbreaking
story, Stosh.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.581
I know, I still
have issues.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.515
About Horst,
the albino?

08:35.549 --> 08:37.084
Yeah.

08:37.117 --> 08:40.654
All right, uh, ladies,
it's about, uh,

08:40.688 --> 08:43.757
six hours past my
bedtime, so I'm leaving.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.693
Oh, well, it was fun
hanging out with you, Stosh.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.327
Yeah, you, too.
You know, we should...

08:47.360 --> 08:48.762
we should do it again.
Maybe Saturday night?

08:48.796 --> 08:51.031
I got a couple of tickets
to the Yankees game

08:51.064 --> 08:52.232
with your
name on it.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.767
And mine.
And the Yankees.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.202
Are you asking me out?

08:55.235 --> 08:56.203
Yeah.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.705
Wow.

08:57.738 --> 09:00.574
I haven't gone out with
a dude in, like, six years.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.042
Oh, you know what?

09:02.075 --> 09:03.711
It's easy,
it's just like riding a bike,

09:03.744 --> 09:05.378
except in this case,

09:05.412 --> 09:07.114
a very large,
powerful motorcycle.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.616
You know what?

09:08.649 --> 09:10.751
You're a douche bag, you
own it, and I like that.

09:10.784 --> 09:11.752
Thank you.
So let's do this.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.020
All right.
Sounds good.
Yeah?

09:13.053 --> 09:14.622
See you then.
Awesome.

09:15.488 --> 09:18.959
And boom goes
the dynamite.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.028
Huh.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.062
Funny.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.697
When I came over

09:23.731 --> 09:25.565
earlier, it was because
I thought you were hot.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.567
Really?
Yeah.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.069
I thought I might
score a date with you.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.204
Really?

09:31.238 --> 09:32.405
Yeah.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.808
Interesting.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.810
Sorry.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.011
(sighs)

09:39.279 --> 09:41.481
You still want one?

09:41.514 --> 09:43.583
Yeah.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.318
Okay.

09:48.822 --> 09:51.158
I want to try being a lesbian.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.761
Can I finish
my tea first?

09:53.794 --> 09:56.229
Not right now.
That's ridiculous.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.431
On Friday. I have a date
with your friend April.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.300
Wait, what?
Why are you looking
at me like that?

10:00.333 --> 10:01.802
You went out with her.
She's great, right?

10:01.835 --> 10:04.071
At the moment, she's dead to me,

10:04.104 --> 10:06.640
but, yeah, she's lovely.

10:06.674 --> 10:10.443
And you know, I was never one of
those girls who "experimented."

10:10.477 --> 10:12.079
You know, my freshman
year in college,

10:12.112 --> 10:13.781
I had a roommate who went
through a lesbian phase,

10:13.814 --> 10:15.683
so I got to hear
a lot of what it was like

10:15.716 --> 10:17.184
from under my covers,
but that's it.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.686
And now you want
to give it a shot?

10:18.719 --> 10:19.687
Yeah.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.488
You know, because, um...

10:21.521 --> 10:23.991
as I get older,
I've discovered...

10:24.024 --> 10:25.292
you like who you like.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.994
And sexuality

10:27.027 --> 10:28.261
is a fluid thing,

10:28.295 --> 10:30.097
and you have
to go with the flow.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.832
Why are you acting so stunned?

10:31.865 --> 10:32.700
I am not acting.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.467
I am stunned.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.036
STOSH: Sorry to barge in.
Zara, can I borrow your van?

10:36.069 --> 10:37.705
I've got to go
to the Bronx

10:37.738 --> 10:39.539
to pick up tickets
for my date with April.

10:39.572 --> 10:40.874
Hello, Caryn.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.144
Um, yeah, keys are
on the counter.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.847
Great. I hope she doesn't mind
the skybox behind home plate.

10:46.880 --> 10:47.881
Good-bye, Caryn.

10:50.383 --> 10:53.887
So... this is actually
not about April at all.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.789
This is about
your weird, immature,

10:55.823 --> 10:57.024
unresolved thing with Stosh.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.826
No. As I told you,

10:58.859 --> 11:00.861
it's about going
with the fluids, okay?

11:00.894 --> 11:02.896
And-and just... and flowing.

11:02.930 --> 11:05.198
Shut up.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.074
Eric, it's Zara.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.242
ERIC:
Just a second!

11:15.275 --> 11:16.576
What are you doing in there?

11:16.609 --> 11:18.078
No, I-I was just
Googling a few things.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.347
I just need
a second, okay?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.682
Ew.

11:23.616 --> 11:24.885
(panting):
Hey.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.119
Yeah, come on in.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.990
Oh, Googling things.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.691
Okay, got it.

11:31.725 --> 11:32.893
Still weird.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.061
So, what's up?

11:34.094 --> 11:35.328
Well, um,

11:35.362 --> 11:38.265
I just came to congratulate you.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.167
Thank you. Yeah, it came
in the mail today

11:40.200 --> 11:41.568
from the Googly-Eye Barn.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.371
Now the real work begins.

11:44.404 --> 11:45.906
No, not about that.

11:45.939 --> 11:49.109
Eric, how would you like
to be my darts partner

11:49.142 --> 11:50.610
for the rest of the tournament?

11:50.643 --> 11:51.879
Sounds great; I love darts.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.613
And I'm not gonna lie.

11:53.646 --> 11:56.183
I really like hanging out
with all those hot ladies.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.885
Right, about that.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.754
Um, let's just not, you know,
bring up the girl/boy thing

12:00.788 --> 12:02.622
or say anything about it

12:02.655 --> 12:06.393
or even use words like "he"
or "him" or "my penis."

12:06.426 --> 12:07.795
You know?
Oh. Yeah.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.196
Just so we don't make
a thing of it.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.764
Yeah, no, totally, I get that.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.900
I can keep it on the dillzies
for realzies.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.201
Greatzies.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.769
(laughter)

12:15.803 --> 12:18.839
Well, I'm going to let
you get back to doing...

12:23.410 --> 12:25.946
Hello, my child.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.949
Oh!

12:28.982 --> 12:30.050
Look who's out of her PJ's

12:30.083 --> 12:32.319
and all dressed up
like Mariska Hargitay.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.954
I have a hot date tonight.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.055
Oh, yeah,
you got a date?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.990
Is he gonna pick you up
on a Citi Bike?

12:37.024 --> 12:39.126
Huh? Piggyback? Rickshaw?

12:39.159 --> 12:40.560
Hey!

12:40.593 --> 12:41.628
Let me find parking;
I'll be right back.

12:41.661 --> 12:42.996
Hey!
Hey!

12:44.197 --> 12:45.398
What's she doing here?

12:45.432 --> 12:46.934
The game's not
until tomorrow night.

12:46.967 --> 12:50.237
Yeah, but Wilco is playing
at McCarren Park tonight.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.471
You made a date with April?

12:51.504 --> 12:52.806
I made a date with April.

12:52.840 --> 12:53.807
After I made a date with April?

12:53.841 --> 12:55.642
After you made a date
with April.

12:55.675 --> 12:56.844
(gasps) I'm sorry.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.846
I didn't know you guys
were exclusive.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.413
That's not the point.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.950
You're not gay and you know it.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.252
I am gay for April,

13:05.285 --> 13:07.955
and I have never felt
more alive.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.789
You know, maybe you
should try being gay.

13:09.823 --> 13:11.658
Based on your clothes
and grooming habits,

13:11.691 --> 13:14.094
the transition should be
relatively easy for you.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.263
I know what you're doing,
and it's not gonna work.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.364
You can't win.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.099
It is not a
contest, Stosh.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.868
It's a matter
of the heart.

13:20.901 --> 13:24.471
It's about finding true love,
and I will win.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.006
Caryn, I can't find
parking anywhere.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.841
Get in. Let's go.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.011
Bam goes the dynamite.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.881
Boom. It's "boom goes
the dynamite."

13:33.914 --> 13:34.848
You look cute.
Hi.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.716
Thank you.
Hi, Stosh.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.420
*

13:43.023 --> 13:45.225
(indistinct chatter)

14:07.380 --> 14:09.582
*

14:13.753 --> 14:16.356
(cheering)

14:31.939 --> 14:33.540
Oh, yes.

14:39.812 --> 14:42.149
Boob.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.786
(cheering)

14:52.759 --> 14:56.930
Hi. I would like two tickets
to the Sunday matinee.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.132
Upper balcony is perfect.

14:59.166 --> 15:01.468
Caryn Goldfarb.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.070
Yes.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.204
Thank you.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.538
Oh, Caryn?

15:05.572 --> 15:06.974
You wouldn't, by chance,

15:07.007 --> 15:08.976
be buying those
two Sunday matinee tickets

15:09.009 --> 15:10.410
for you and April, would you?

15:10.443 --> 15:12.279
Yeah, we're gonna go see
the Spider-Man musical,

15:12.312 --> 15:13.981
which I hear is very good

15:14.014 --> 15:15.482
now that none of the performers
are getting killed.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.985
Well, I'll try to have April
back in time.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.919
Back from what?

15:19.953 --> 15:21.121
Oh, right.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.622
How could you know?

15:22.655 --> 15:24.391
We're going to the Hamptons
on Saturday.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.226
We'll be staying
in a hotel room,

15:26.259 --> 15:29.729
together, if you catch my drift.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.131
By drift,

15:31.164 --> 15:32.966
I mean sex.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.968
Boom goes the dynamite.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.040
Not if it goes boom on Friday.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.842
Hey, April.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.144
Yeah, it's me.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.145
What are you doing

15:45.178 --> 15:47.414
Friday night?

15:47.447 --> 15:50.417
Oh, right,
that's Zara's dart tournament.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.452
You want to get plastered
and watch it together

15:52.485 --> 15:55.022
and then go home
and have a great deal of sex?

15:55.055 --> 15:56.456
What do you mean,
am I ready?

15:56.489 --> 15:58.191
Of course I'm ready, yes.
Give me that.

15:58.225 --> 15:59.326
Oh, my God, I can't wait. Bye!
Give me that phone.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.994
Boom.

16:01.028 --> 16:03.596
You trying to turn this into
some kind of sex competition?

16:03.630 --> 16:05.965
Yep, and I'm gonna win,

16:05.999 --> 16:08.335
'cause I am a woman,

16:08.368 --> 16:10.637
and I know what feels good
down there,

16:10.670 --> 16:13.040
and I am going to arrive
to down there

16:13.073 --> 16:15.708
24 hours before you,
so boom!

16:16.576 --> 16:18.645
Bam! Boom!

16:18.678 --> 16:20.280
It's boom.
(imitates explosion)

16:20.313 --> 16:22.015
Emergency. Help.

16:22.049 --> 16:23.283
What?
I committed

16:23.316 --> 16:26.019
to having lesbian sex soon,
very soon,

16:26.053 --> 16:27.020
so I need some tutoring.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.355
I have to give April
the best orgasm

16:28.388 --> 16:30.057
she's ever had in her life,

16:30.090 --> 16:31.824
or at least better
than Stosh can.

16:31.858 --> 16:33.060
Of her life.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.061
This has nothing to do
with Stosh.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.195
Will you please help me?

16:35.228 --> 16:36.629
Um, let me think about that.

16:36.663 --> 16:37.997
Uh, no.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.199
I don't want any part of this.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.700
April is a human being,

16:40.733 --> 16:42.235
and she deserves better
than to be caught up

16:42.269 --> 16:44.871
in some twisted little game
between you and Stosh.

16:44.904 --> 16:47.474
This is not
about me and Stosh, okay?

16:47.507 --> 16:50.009
This is about
me and, um...

16:50.043 --> 16:51.578
April.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.046
This is about me and April.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.814
Caryn, enough.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.416
You can't parade around
trying to pass yourself off

16:56.449 --> 16:58.585
as a lesbian just because
there's something in it for you.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.053
It's disrespectful
to gay people.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.254
It's wrong, and frankly,

17:01.288 --> 17:03.022
you should be ashamed
of yourself.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.491
ERIC:
So,

17:04.524 --> 17:06.059
how do I look for the finals?

17:06.093 --> 17:07.927
I'm wearing everything
you gave me.

17:08.895 --> 17:11.264
Totally different situation.

17:11.298 --> 17:13.300
Awesome?

17:21.108 --> 17:22.475
(cheering)

17:29.082 --> 17:31.751
You are strong,
you are fearless,

17:31.784 --> 17:34.254
you are Batman.

17:34.287 --> 17:35.988
I'm Batman.

17:36.456 --> 17:39.292
(cheering)

17:39.326 --> 17:40.427
Yes!

17:40.460 --> 17:42.095
That was amazing!

17:42.129 --> 17:43.196
Did you see that?

17:43.230 --> 17:44.297
Amazing.

17:44.331 --> 17:45.765
Thank God you were replaced.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.200
Oh, shut up.
You shut up.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.968
Shut up.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.203
Super excited for later.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.371
Ha!

17:51.404 --> 17:53.773
Later, exciting stuff!

17:53.806 --> 17:55.208
Exciting stuff?

17:55.242 --> 17:57.076
Is something exciting
happening tonight?

17:57.110 --> 17:58.311
Hey, Stosh.
Hi.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.980
What are you doing here?
Oh, come on.

18:01.013 --> 18:03.883
Is my love for darts not
well documented at this point?

18:03.916 --> 18:05.385
Okay, well, maybe
you should just...

18:05.418 --> 18:06.553
Join you guys for the next game?

18:06.586 --> 18:08.121
I'd love to.
Yay!

18:08.155 --> 18:09.722
Can we get another round
of shots, please?

18:09.756 --> 18:11.691
Crotch shots.
Crotch shots.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.168
(cheering)

18:21.201 --> 18:22.902
Did you see that?

18:22.935 --> 18:24.771
All right. I got it.
Thank you.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.140
Come on, I got it.
I got it.
I think I can pay for my date.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.142
I got it, I got it.
Just take mine, take mine.
I got it. I got it.

18:29.176 --> 18:30.510
Okay.
Take my card.

18:30.543 --> 18:33.146
Guys, it's cash only.
I got it.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.182
I got it. No, I got it.
I can pay...
I got it, I got it.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.483
WOMAN:
Here we go, everybody.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.617
The final two darts

18:37.650 --> 18:39.219
for the championship.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.456
(cheering)

18:44.457 --> 18:45.692
Yeah!

18:45.725 --> 18:46.959

18:46.993 --> 18:48.361
Oh!

18:48.395 --> 18:50.363
WOMAN:
Oh, this is it.

18:50.397 --> 18:52.199
This is the big one.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.568
Oh.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.938
Okay.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.807
(chuckles)

19:00.840 --> 19:03.543
Okay. Okay.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.791

19:18.825 --> 19:20.793

19:25.198 --> 19:27.267
Yeah!

19:29.035 --> 19:31.571
Eric, I love you!

19:31.604 --> 19:32.539
Me, too!

19:32.572 --> 19:33.740
Hey, come on, let's dance.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.209
Oh, wait, wait,
oh, wait, uh-uh.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.545
A silly misunderstanding
needs to be cleared up here.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.547
Hey, do you
like puppets?

19:40.580 --> 19:42.181
Yeah.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.250
A lot.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.684
Oh! Okay.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.855
Have fun, girls.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.258
* We'll put
all other things aside *

19:51.291 --> 19:53.426
(grunting)

19:53.460 --> 19:56.763
* Get in this time
and show me some affection *

19:56.796 --> 20:01.834
* We're going for
those pleasures in the night *

20:01.868 --> 20:04.771

20:04.804 --> 20:06.373

Hey.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.413

20:13.446 --> 20:14.881

20:14.914 --> 20:17.517
* I'll let it go
Oh.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.119
* I'm so excited
(clears throat)

20:20.152 --> 20:21.388
* And I just can't hide it...

20:21.421 --> 20:23.089
Oh, okay.

20:23.122 --> 20:24.424
Oh, guys.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.259
* I'm about to lose control

20:26.293 --> 20:28.695
* And I think I like it

20:28.728 --> 20:31.431
* I'm so excited
I'm out of here.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.566
* And I just can't hide it

20:34.334 --> 20:35.802
* And I know, I know

20:35.835 --> 20:37.136
* I know, I know, I know

20:37.169 --> 20:39.372
* I want you...
Oh, boy.

20:39.406 --> 20:40.640
Well said.

20:40.673 --> 20:44.477
* We shouldn't even think
about tomorrow *

20:44.511 --> 20:47.480
* Sweet memories will last
a long, long time... *

20:47.514 --> 20:48.815
I'm sorry.

Thank you!

20:50.149 --> 20:52.619

20:52.652 --> 20:55.121

20:55.154 --> 20:57.624

playing around *

20:57.657 --> 20:59.826
* Boy, that's just fine

20:59.859 --> 21:02.329
* Let's get excited

21:02.362 --> 21:05.632

21:05.665 --> 21:08.100
* I'm about to lose control

21:08.134 --> 21:10.837
