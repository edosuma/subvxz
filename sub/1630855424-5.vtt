WEBVTT

00:26.161 --> 00:28.115
- Go!
- Come on, let's move it!

00:28.205 --> 00:29.789
- Come on, come on!
- Let's go, come on!

00:29.872 --> 00:31.416
Move it, let's go!

00:32.292 --> 00:34.752
What the fuck is this place?

00:34.836 --> 00:37.505
This isn't jail.

00:50.977 --> 00:53.438
You, I said, get out!

00:53.521 --> 00:54.982
Get out!

00:55.065 --> 00:56.483
Hurry up. Let's go!

01:24.927 --> 01:26.513
Where the fuck are they taking us?

01:26.596 --> 01:28.223
You really don't know?

01:28.306 --> 01:31.059
They're shipping us back to China,
you fool.

01:31.143 --> 01:34.646
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

01:48.195 --> 01:49.577
No Chinese!

01:49.661 --> 01:52.705
American. American.

01:52.789 --> 01:54.499
Born in San Francisco.

01:54.582 --> 01:58.711
You hear that?
This one says he's not a chink.

01:58.795 --> 02:00.963
American.
Born in San Francisco.

02:01.048 --> 02:03.091
Yeah?

02:03.175 --> 02:04.634
You're a regular
Abraham Lincoln.

02:06.886 --> 02:10.473
Get the fuck back in line.

03:41.231 --> 03:44.859
The police
will not let us see her.

03:44.942 --> 03:47.737
They won't even tell us
what she is charged with.

03:47.820 --> 03:49.864
I would like to approach
the Six Companies.

03:49.947 --> 03:51.158
No.

03:51.241 --> 03:53.160
They have friends
at City Hall.

03:53.243 --> 03:56.454
The Six Companies
will not help us,

03:56.538 --> 03:59.291
and I don't blame them.

03:59.374 --> 04:02.419
Mai Ling invested that money
without our permission.

04:02.502 --> 04:05.422
Her recklessness
has left us weak.

04:05.505 --> 04:06.881
What are you saying?

04:06.964 --> 04:09.176
Perhaps the tong
is best served

04:09.259 --> 04:12.845
leaving Mai Ling where she is.

04:14.431 --> 04:16.266
Be careful, Wu Jin.

04:16.343 --> 04:18.476
Put your feelings aside.

04:18.560 --> 04:22.939
You can't deny
she's led us astray.

04:38.871 --> 04:40.873
Excuse me.

04:42.542 --> 04:44.711
Li Yong, wait.

04:45.962 --> 04:49.299
- Hey.
- You agree with them?

04:49.376 --> 04:52.760
I would never go against you.
You know that.

04:52.844 --> 04:56.306
But I see their side.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.933
Did you know she was
investing with the ducks?

05:01.019 --> 05:03.563
I knew
she was considering it.

05:03.646 --> 05:06.108
Do you know
how much she gave them?

05:06.191 --> 05:09.819
1/3 of the tong's
cash reserves.

05:09.902 --> 05:11.738
I assume she would
have consulted with you

05:11.821 --> 05:15.242
over a major investment,
so did everyone else,

05:15.325 --> 05:18.245
which makes you complicit.

05:19.579 --> 05:23.250
I'm new here, so I see
things with fresh eyes.

05:23.333 --> 05:25.377
And I can't help but wonder
how things would be

05:25.460 --> 05:27.170
with a leader
who served the tong

05:27.254 --> 05:29.547
and not the other way around.

05:39.891 --> 05:44.646
This deportation center marks
a bold new era in our city,

05:44.729 --> 05:46.814
one in which
we will no longer tolerate

05:46.898 --> 05:48.900
the damage being done
to our society

05:48.984 --> 05:51.778
by the lawless encroachment
of the Chinese.

05:51.861 --> 05:55.198
Murder, prostitution,
and slave labor

05:55.282 --> 05:58.535
have gone unchecked
for too long.

05:58.618 --> 06:00.370
Through the efforts
of my office

06:00.447 --> 06:02.872
and the San Francisco
Police Department,

06:02.955 --> 06:06.168
we will put
these criminals and interlopers

06:06.251 --> 06:09.837
where they belong,
not on our streets,

06:09.921 --> 06:14.051
but on boats back
to whence they came.

06:18.138 --> 06:20.765
As mayor,
I will work hand in hand

06:20.848 --> 06:25.270
with the governor to ensure
that the Exclusion Act passes.

06:25.353 --> 06:30.692
Together, we will restore
America to her former glory

06:30.775 --> 06:35.863
and bring prosperity to the
honest, hardworking citizens

06:35.947 --> 06:38.741
who built
this great country of ours.

06:46.208 --> 06:48.626
Can we count on your vote?

06:48.710 --> 06:50.253
Excellent speech, sir.

06:50.337 --> 06:53.006
If only the crowd
shared your enthusiasm.

06:53.090 --> 06:56.676
Well, more bad news,
I'm afraid.

06:56.759 --> 06:59.054
Thayer played it
better than we thought.

06:59.137 --> 07:02.057
The press is eating it up.

07:02.140 --> 07:03.891
I can read.

07:03.975 --> 07:05.935
Sir, even with
the Irish vote behind you,

07:06.019 --> 07:07.895
it's starting
to pose a real threat.

07:07.979 --> 07:11.024
In that case, I suggest
you do something about it,

07:11.108 --> 07:13.818
or I will find someone who can.

07:17.822 --> 07:20.033
If I don't weigh in,
what are you worried about?

07:20.117 --> 07:21.493
Are you kidding?

07:21.576 --> 07:26.456
I count a dozen bulls,
and that's just on the outside.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.958
We've taken on bulls before.

07:29.042 --> 07:30.252
Not in their turf.

07:30.335 --> 07:31.628
We could be walking
into anything.

07:31.711 --> 07:33.088
So we buy them off.

07:33.171 --> 07:34.797
No, Chao says
these guys report

07:34.881 --> 07:36.466
to the new police chief.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.093
They won't deal
with the Chinese.

07:38.176 --> 07:40.595
Look, the next boat
leaves in two days.

07:40.678 --> 07:42.139
We've got to do something now.

07:42.222 --> 07:43.640
I know.

07:43.723 --> 07:45.683
We just need to find a way in.

08:23.930 --> 08:26.141
That's pretty nasty, huh?

08:27.267 --> 08:29.894
You get used to it, sort of.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.522
- Do I know you?
- No.

08:32.599 --> 08:35.108
No, it's just, you're
the leader of the Hop Wei.

08:35.192 --> 08:37.527
It's an honor, you know?

08:37.604 --> 08:40.113
Hey, easy with that shit.

08:40.197 --> 08:42.157
Come here.

08:45.118 --> 08:47.370
- What's your name?
- Sicheng, sir.

08:49.039 --> 08:51.541
You can call me
Young Jun, OK?

08:55.087 --> 08:57.589
How long you been here,
Sicheng?

08:57.672 --> 08:59.626
A couple weeks.

08:59.716 --> 09:02.677
But I hear a bunch of us
are getting shipped out soon.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.804
People are busting out
of here though, right?

09:04.887 --> 09:07.390
I've seen a few try.

09:07.474 --> 09:11.638
These bulls,
they're not messing around.

09:11.728 --> 09:15.190
You try to run for it,
death sentence.

09:19.569 --> 09:22.905
The Hop Wei
gonna bust you out?

09:26.076 --> 09:29.162
They'll tear this fucking
place apart if they have to.

09:37.170 --> 09:40.715
Look, my friends and I
got some bunks staked out.

09:40.798 --> 09:43.670
And we even got some tobacco.

09:43.760 --> 09:46.263
Safety in numbers, right?

09:51.559 --> 09:54.146
I could use a fucking smoke.

10:10.745 --> 10:15.250
Oh, thank you, Sicheng.

10:18.705 --> 10:21.256
Mm.

10:21.339 --> 10:24.176
Anyone got a light?

10:26.803 --> 10:28.680
Just my luck.

10:28.763 --> 10:30.640
That's the thing about luck.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.267
You could have it for years,

10:32.350 --> 10:35.103
and then one day,
it just runs out.

10:35.187 --> 10:38.565
You don't remember me, do you?

10:38.648 --> 10:40.233
My father was a tailor.

10:40.317 --> 10:41.901
He owned a shop
on Grand Street.

10:41.985 --> 10:43.361
I remember.

10:43.445 --> 10:45.280
He had all
those silk handkerchiefs.

10:45.363 --> 10:49.117
Yeah, yeah, he even made
some suits for the Hop Wei.

10:50.285 --> 10:53.871
Then my grandparents
got really sick.

10:53.955 --> 10:57.875
You know, we had to send more
money than usual back to China.

10:57.959 --> 11:00.170
He couldn't pay the Hop Wei.

11:00.253 --> 11:01.963
They busted up his shop.

11:02.047 --> 11:06.051
Listen, man, I don't
know anything about that.

11:08.511 --> 11:11.098
Zhang Yong's family
paid their life savings

11:11.181 --> 11:13.308
for protection
against the bull raids.

11:13.391 --> 11:17.645
The problem is,
they didn't get any.

11:17.729 --> 11:22.692
The tongs turned Jinhai's
restaurant into an opium den.

11:23.943 --> 11:26.696
And Qing's brother
was killed in a turf war.

11:26.773 --> 11:29.199
He's nine years old.

11:33.161 --> 11:36.206
You know, in here,
Hop Wei doesn't mean shit.

11:36.289 --> 11:38.166
We're all just cargo,

11:38.250 --> 11:41.294
waiting to get
shipped across the salt.

11:41.378 --> 11:43.046
So what's one less onion?

12:13.535 --> 12:15.620
Agh!

13:02.625 --> 13:05.128
Ahh!

13:29.444 --> 13:32.655
Shit, you trying to give me
a heart attack or something?

13:36.076 --> 13:40.538
Right, OK, well,
I haven't seen her myself,

13:40.622 --> 13:42.332
but they've got her in holding.

13:42.415 --> 13:44.501
Buckley.

13:44.584 --> 13:46.669
You know what he wants.

13:51.049 --> 13:52.550
I get it.

13:52.634 --> 13:55.678
Will he hold up his end
and let her go, right?

13:57.389 --> 13:59.349
That's a gamble, my friend.

14:12.737 --> 14:15.657
Get her out.

14:19.869 --> 14:21.913
Whatever you say, boss.

14:29.754 --> 14:33.258
Did you do this?
Is this your work?

14:33.341 --> 14:35.843
You make money?

14:35.927 --> 14:38.180
Sorry, tight quarters back here.

14:38.263 --> 14:40.932
What do you want?
Why are you doing this?

14:41.016 --> 14:43.226
Go easy.
He doesn't understand.

14:43.310 --> 14:46.646
I think he understands just fine.

14:46.729 --> 14:48.315
Sir?

14:48.398 --> 14:50.608
Are you OK, sir?

14:52.569 --> 14:53.736
Who are you?

14:53.820 --> 14:55.197
Sir, is everything OK, sir?

14:55.280 --> 14:57.699
What do you want?

15:09.544 --> 15:11.046
I apologize for the ruckus, ma'am.

15:11.129 --> 15:13.215
We just need to ask you
a few questions.

15:15.217 --> 15:16.884
This your father's shop?

15:21.223 --> 15:23.725
Anyone ever ask you
to print money?

15:24.851 --> 15:27.437
Money?

15:27.520 --> 15:29.689
We're investigating
these bills.

15:29.772 --> 15:32.985
We think someone might be
printing them for the tongs.

15:35.153 --> 15:36.571
What's this about?

15:36.654 --> 15:39.574
Let me handle it.

15:39.657 --> 15:43.286
He prints sign, paper,
no money.

15:44.746 --> 15:46.123
Father good man.

15:46.206 --> 15:48.000
Want no trouble.

15:48.083 --> 15:50.585
See? Sick.

15:52.670 --> 15:55.090
This upset make
more sick, more bad.

15:59.594 --> 16:01.679
I think we're barking
up the wrong tree here.

16:03.806 --> 16:05.808
I'm inclined to agree.

16:11.731 --> 16:13.525
Thank you for your time, ma'am.

16:13.608 --> 16:15.152
Sorry about the mess.

16:18.363 --> 16:20.740
This moment requires
a certain moral clarity,

16:20.823 --> 16:24.786
which Thayer's soft populism
can't accommodate.

16:27.622 --> 16:29.666
You don't agree?

16:31.751 --> 16:36.256
Walter, I do wish you'd
share your troubles with me.

16:36.339 --> 16:37.840
I'm quite clever.

16:37.924 --> 16:39.926
Maybe I could help.

16:45.557 --> 16:49.019
My campaign is faltering.

16:49.096 --> 16:51.021
Thayer is gaining traction,

16:51.098 --> 16:53.898
and the election
is mere weeks away.

16:53.982 --> 16:56.818
He has a substantial war chest.

16:56.901 --> 16:59.154
Perhaps we could
court new donors.

16:59.237 --> 17:01.906
It's not about the funds.

17:05.868 --> 17:09.116
Campaigning doesn't
come naturally to me.

17:10.290 --> 17:14.002
I've always preferred
the back office work,

17:14.086 --> 17:16.588
steering men like Blake
from the shadows.

17:16.671 --> 17:18.673
But you're much too smart
and ambitious

17:18.756 --> 17:22.010
to be some blowhard's fixer.

17:22.094 --> 17:24.179
You've paid your dues.

17:24.262 --> 17:26.806
This is your time.

17:26.889 --> 17:31.561
I always saw the man
in front as a fool,

17:31.644 --> 17:34.106
a puppet.

17:36.108 --> 17:39.069
And now that man is me.

17:39.146 --> 17:42.405
Walter,

17:42.489 --> 17:46.153
there is nothing foolish

17:46.243 --> 17:49.496
about wanting something

17:49.579 --> 17:53.291
and risking everything
to have it.

17:59.797 --> 18:02.592
I'm sorry.
Did I overstep?

18:04.094 --> 18:07.847
No, it's not you.

18:12.102 --> 18:15.730
I haven't been with anyone
in a long time.

18:19.609 --> 18:21.611
I promise...

18:27.242 --> 18:30.495
You have everything
I could ever want.

19:08.325 --> 19:10.452
- Hey.
- You're late.

19:10.535 --> 19:11.744
Sorry.

19:11.828 --> 19:13.413
Things have been
a little hectic.

19:13.496 --> 19:15.915
Yeah.

19:15.999 --> 19:17.459
The secret service
was at my shop.

19:17.542 --> 19:20.462
They were questioning
my father.

19:20.545 --> 19:23.423
Did they find anything?

19:23.506 --> 19:25.592
No, no, they didn't go upstairs.

19:25.675 --> 19:27.135
But you need
to move those plates.

19:27.219 --> 19:28.386
- What if they come back?
- Yeah.

19:28.470 --> 19:29.762
- What my father finds them?
- OK, OK, OK.

19:29.846 --> 19:31.848
I'm working on it,
but the bulls,

19:31.931 --> 19:34.351
they're all over us.

19:34.434 --> 19:38.938
Hey, I'll talk to Chao,
try and find a place.

19:39.022 --> 19:42.817
Ah Sahm, I don't know
how much longer I can do this.

19:44.819 --> 19:48.948
Hey, I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

19:52.035 --> 19:54.454
You can't promise me that.

20:05.340 --> 20:09.511
I would be lying if I said
it didn't bring me

20:09.594 --> 20:15.558
a great deal of pleasure
to see you like this.

20:15.642 --> 20:17.435
I take it
you received the package.

20:17.519 --> 20:21.023
Your Pinkerton
was quite discreet.

20:21.106 --> 20:23.566
Still, I cannot
emphasize enough how much

20:23.650 --> 20:25.485
I dislike being blackmailed.

20:25.568 --> 20:29.197
Well, you can't blame
a girl for trying.

20:29.281 --> 20:32.034
I suppose
leverage is hard to come by,

20:32.117 --> 20:35.037
especially for a Chinese whore.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.372
But it does lead me
to wonder if our arrangement

20:37.455 --> 20:39.791
has run its course.

20:39.874 --> 20:42.544
Perhaps I should still
have you deported now

20:42.627 --> 20:46.006
that you're of no use to me.

20:47.799 --> 20:50.337
I wouldn't say that.

20:50.427 --> 20:52.845
You still have
an election to win.

20:52.929 --> 20:55.682
From what I've read
in the paper, you're trailing.

20:55.765 --> 20:58.018
I can be a very powerful ally.

20:58.101 --> 20:59.977
We just arrested
the heads of two

21:00.062 --> 21:03.023
of Chinatown's biggest gangs
in a single night.

21:03.106 --> 21:06.276
The press will make quite
a meal of that, believe me.

21:06.353 --> 21:07.694
Who else did you arrest?

21:07.777 --> 21:09.821
The head of the Hop Wei,
who will be deported

21:09.904 --> 21:11.406
before the week is out.

21:11.489 --> 21:12.699
Wait, Mr. Buckley.

21:12.782 --> 21:15.160
I already know what
you're going to say.

21:16.494 --> 21:18.955
With both leaders gone,
there will be a power vacuum.

21:19.039 --> 21:21.368
And if I don't
fill it with you,

21:21.458 --> 21:23.918
I will be left
with chaos on the streets.

21:24.002 --> 21:26.879
Not chaos.

21:26.963 --> 21:29.091
War.

21:29.174 --> 21:33.095
And you can prevent this?

21:33.178 --> 21:35.972
As long as it serves
both of our purposes.

21:37.599 --> 21:40.387
And then?

21:40.477 --> 21:43.730
And then I will crush the Hop Wei,

21:43.813 --> 21:49.236
take their businesses,
and we will share the spoils.

21:53.656 --> 21:55.825
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy.

21:55.908 --> 21:59.829
OK, just tell us, how many
guards and how many guns?

22:01.748 --> 22:03.833
I don't like this any more than you.

22:03.916 --> 22:06.878
But my friend here,
he's built a little different.

22:06.961 --> 22:08.296
He can go all night.

22:08.380 --> 22:11.133
I already told you, there's no way

22:11.216 --> 22:13.176
you chinks
are getting in there.

22:15.422 --> 22:18.640
And I told you,
that's the wrong answer.

22:39.327 --> 22:41.246
Enough!

22:43.790 --> 22:46.751
Hey, hey!
Let the boy go!

22:46.834 --> 22:49.379
- Sergeant!
- Go, go!

22:49.456 --> 22:52.090
Sergeant O'Hara, stand down.

22:52.174 --> 22:53.800
So this is what we do now,

22:53.883 --> 22:55.177
separate mothers
from their children.

22:55.260 --> 22:56.553
We enforce the law.

22:56.636 --> 22:58.596
There were more than
a dozen Chinese squatting

22:58.680 --> 23:00.348
in a domicile
that was zoned for four.

23:00.432 --> 23:02.350
These are not criminals,
for fuck's sake.

23:02.434 --> 23:03.768
They're just regular families.

23:03.851 --> 23:05.770
What about this situation
seems regular

23:05.853 --> 23:06.979
to you, Sergeant?

23:07.064 --> 23:08.940
Because what I see
are a bunch of people

23:09.024 --> 23:11.859
crammed together like vermin
spreading disease.

23:11.943 --> 23:14.071
And it is my job,
as it is yours,

23:14.154 --> 23:15.613
to clean this mess up.

23:15.697 --> 23:17.699
That boy was two
or three years old.

23:17.782 --> 23:19.659
What happens to him when
his mother is put on a boat?

23:19.742 --> 23:21.995
He'll get taken
to a nice Christian orphanage.

23:22.079 --> 23:24.372
And then, when his mother
goes back to China,

23:24.456 --> 23:27.292
she goes with a clear message
to those who haven't left yet

23:27.375 --> 23:30.920
that there is nothing
for them here.

23:31.004 --> 23:32.499
I didn't sign up for this shit.

23:32.589 --> 23:33.673
None of us did.

23:33.756 --> 23:34.757
Sergeant O'Hara,

23:34.841 --> 23:36.593
I have been more than patient
with you so far.

23:36.676 --> 23:39.346
But if you are unwilling
to execute your duties,

23:39.429 --> 23:42.307
then maybe you don't
belong here anymore.

23:46.811 --> 23:49.231
You're goddamn right,
I don't.

24:10.418 --> 24:13.540
Still picking fights
you can't win, I see.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.802
Father?

24:22.549 --> 24:24.766
What are you doing here?

24:24.849 --> 24:27.644
Looks like we both
fucked up pretty good, huh?

24:30.647 --> 24:33.108
Printing your own chop?

24:33.191 --> 24:35.902
That's a ballsy move.

24:35.986 --> 24:38.405
Cops were all over us.

24:38.488 --> 24:40.448
Shutting down rackets.

24:40.532 --> 24:42.700
I had to do something.

24:42.784 --> 24:46.204
That doesn't explain
why you're here alone.

24:46.288 --> 24:48.540
What about Ah Sahm
and your brothers?

24:50.167 --> 24:52.210
I guess they thought
locking up the boss

24:52.294 --> 24:54.462
would send a message.

24:55.963 --> 24:57.382
How about you?

24:57.465 --> 25:00.802
I thought you'd be halfway
to New York by now.

25:00.885 --> 25:03.430
After I left,
I traveled north.

25:03.513 --> 25:05.682
Never seen land like that.

25:05.765 --> 25:08.018
Wild, open.

25:08.101 --> 25:11.938
I met some Chinese ranchers
and decided to stay a bit.

25:12.022 --> 25:16.693
A week later, the duck mob
showed up, told them to leave.

25:16.776 --> 25:20.530
When they refused,
they came back with guns.

25:20.607 --> 25:22.199
Fuck.

25:22.282 --> 25:24.909
It was fucking ugly.

25:26.411 --> 25:28.371
Next thing I know,
I'm in a wagon

25:28.455 --> 25:29.831
with a dozen other onions.

25:29.914 --> 25:31.874
We end up here.

25:37.089 --> 25:41.926
I always thought I'd find
something better out there,

25:42.010 --> 25:45.180
but I was wrong.

25:45.263 --> 25:49.101
We have no power
outside our own bowl.

25:49.184 --> 25:52.479
I'm sorry you're here,

25:52.562 --> 25:54.606
but I'm happy to see you.

25:56.858 --> 26:00.153
You too.

26:02.572 --> 26:04.782
Those wagons got
to be pretty big, right?

26:04.866 --> 26:06.368
They bring food in
every morning.

26:06.451 --> 26:08.245
If we hide inside
the delivery wagons,

26:08.328 --> 26:10.372
we can get into the camp
without anyone seeing us.

26:10.455 --> 26:11.914
If we can get in the wagons,

26:11.999 --> 26:13.708
then we just have
to find Young Jun

26:13.791 --> 26:15.627
and escape an armed fortress
without getting killed.

26:15.710 --> 26:17.837
That's not much of a plan.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.214
We need an army
to take them on.

26:19.297 --> 26:21.758
We've got an army.
The boys are ready to scrap.

26:21.841 --> 26:23.385
If it means getting
Young Jun back...

26:23.468 --> 26:25.262
- You're talking about...
- Every one of us would go.

26:25.345 --> 26:26.596
A fucking blood jam, Hong.

26:26.673 --> 26:29.599
- We'd all get diced.
- He'd do it for us, man.

26:31.101 --> 26:32.977
Look, I know shit's been
off between you two.

26:33.061 --> 26:34.229
- No, it's not about that.
- But--

26:34.312 --> 26:37.983
It's not about that.
Listen, OK?

26:38.066 --> 26:40.068
After I was skinned in,
I got arrested.

26:40.152 --> 26:42.237
And they could have bought
me out, but they didn't.

26:42.320 --> 26:43.863
So what,
you're holding a grudge?

26:43.946 --> 26:46.533
No, no, I'm saying--
I'm saying they were right.

26:46.616 --> 26:49.244
They had to put the tong first,
and so do we.

26:49.327 --> 26:51.246
If we attack the camp head on,

26:51.329 --> 26:53.873
we're gonna bring a fucking
hurricane down on Chinatown.

26:53.956 --> 26:55.750
And our brothers
are gonna end up dead

26:55.833 --> 26:57.877
or in the belly of a boat.

26:57.960 --> 27:00.630
- What?
- Chao's here.

27:02.215 --> 27:06.469
OK, cut him loose and drop
him somewhere in the pond.

27:06.553 --> 27:08.555
Hey.

27:10.015 --> 27:12.309
How did you get out?

27:12.392 --> 27:13.935
Someone owed me a favor.

27:14.019 --> 27:16.563
Well, maybe they
owe you another one.

27:17.981 --> 27:20.900
I wish it was that easy.

27:31.536 --> 27:34.247
I take it
you heard about Mai Ling.

27:34.331 --> 27:37.125
Yeah, she got pinched.
So what?

27:37.209 --> 27:41.296
So you haven't heard.
She's out.

27:41.379 --> 27:42.880
Of course she is.

27:42.964 --> 27:45.050
With Young Jun
still locked up...

27:45.133 --> 27:47.010
You think
she's gonna make a move.

27:47.094 --> 27:49.887
I think
it's crossed her mind.

27:49.971 --> 27:51.973
It sounds like I need
to have a chat with my sister.

27:52.057 --> 27:55.018
Wait, there's more.

27:55.102 --> 27:56.728
People are talking.

27:56.811 --> 27:58.146
There are a lot
of rumors going around

27:58.230 --> 28:00.767
about the bulls
raiding the Hop Wei.

28:00.857 --> 28:02.567
I don't give a shit
about gossip, Chao.

28:02.650 --> 28:05.903
Good for you, but other
people might, like Happy Jack.

28:05.988 --> 28:08.448
If he finds out we paid him
with fake chop,

28:08.531 --> 28:11.534
Secret Service is gonna be
the least of your concerns.

28:13.780 --> 28:15.163
You know,
I think I like it better

28:15.247 --> 28:18.625
when you bring me solutions,
not problems.

28:18.708 --> 28:21.294
I have a notion.

28:22.754 --> 28:26.424
Two birds, one stone.

28:26.508 --> 28:30.012
But it's going
to be a very pricey stone.

28:57.789 --> 28:59.707
The council
will meet tomorrow

28:59.791 --> 29:02.335
to discuss your leadership.

29:04.671 --> 29:07.549
They're losing faith.

29:07.632 --> 29:11.469
Well, are you with them?

29:11.553 --> 29:14.931
I am the reason you're here.

29:15.015 --> 29:18.101
The elders wanted
to leave you inside.

29:19.352 --> 29:21.896
I'm sorry.

29:23.065 --> 29:25.275
I made a mistake.

29:26.318 --> 29:30.697
I can't protect you when I
don't know what you're doing.

29:30.780 --> 29:34.159
I know.
It won't happen again.

29:44.127 --> 29:47.464
The money,

29:47.547 --> 29:49.716
can we get it back?

29:51.384 --> 29:55.013
It's gone,
but I'll make it right.

29:59.267 --> 30:02.395
- The fuck is this?
- We have same problem.

30:02.479 --> 30:03.938
You hear what happened
to Hop Wei?

30:04.022 --> 30:08.026
Oh, got raided by the cops
and the fucking Secret Service.

30:08.110 --> 30:10.028
Heard they were looking
for counterfeiters.

30:10.112 --> 30:13.448
Agent Richard Lee.

30:13.531 --> 30:16.118
He live
with your sister-in-law, no?

30:16.201 --> 30:20.372
Oh, small fucking world.

30:20.455 --> 30:22.415
And what is this?

30:22.499 --> 30:24.209
More funny money?

30:24.292 --> 30:26.586
You got balls
just walking in here.

30:26.669 --> 30:29.672
This real money.
Apology from Hop Wei.

30:29.756 --> 30:33.718
And this...

30:33.801 --> 30:39.349
is for you
to deal with problem.

30:39.432 --> 30:41.393
You want me
to kill your cop for you?

30:41.476 --> 30:44.604
For us, Jack.

30:44.687 --> 30:47.774
What, you no want him dead?

30:47.857 --> 30:53.821
Well, let's just say, I have
complicated feelings about it.

30:53.905 --> 30:56.943
Besides, I don't need
to kill him to get paid.

31:10.588 --> 31:12.507
I will take care
of your problem,

31:12.590 --> 31:16.344
but it can't happen
anywhere in my territory.

31:16.428 --> 31:19.014
As far
as my sister-in-law knows,

31:19.097 --> 31:22.350
Agent Lee pissed
off the wrong tong.

31:24.602 --> 31:27.147
Sound like
you solve problem, hm?

31:33.486 --> 31:36.656
Oh, I'm keeping that.

31:36.739 --> 31:39.492
Think of it as a service fee.

31:40.535 --> 31:41.989
For what?

31:42.079 --> 31:44.081
Allowing you
to keep breathing.

31:59.929 --> 32:01.723
- Whoa.
- Jesus fuck!

32:01.806 --> 32:04.142
Lee, I nearly shot you.

32:05.602 --> 32:07.270
I'm not sure
you could hit the broadside

32:07.354 --> 32:09.939
of a barn right now.

32:10.017 --> 32:11.608
What are you doing here?

32:11.691 --> 32:13.360
I'm just wondering how
you live in this mess.

32:13.443 --> 32:16.488
I don't need you
to clean the damn dishes.

32:23.495 --> 32:25.580
Heard you quit the force.

32:25.663 --> 32:29.834
So you just swung by to say,
"I told you so," is that it?

32:29.917 --> 32:35.132
Actually, I came to see
how you were holding up.

32:36.633 --> 32:40.303
Well, Lee, since you asked,

32:40.387 --> 32:46.143
I've got no job, no family,
and no fucking purpose.

32:46.226 --> 32:49.187
But other than that,
I can't complain.

32:51.023 --> 32:54.859
I know Atwood ain't
exactly a warm summer breeze,

32:54.942 --> 32:58.780
but I never thought
I'd see you up and walk away.

32:58.863 --> 33:01.199
You were right all along.

33:01.283 --> 33:04.786
The game's rigged.
We're not meant to succeed.

33:05.745 --> 33:07.747
I guess I did tell you so.

33:07.830 --> 33:09.541
You can fuck off with that,
Mr. Secret Service.

33:09.624 --> 33:12.669
I am not the only cunt
on this porch.

33:22.637 --> 33:24.514
Look on the bright side.

33:24.597 --> 33:27.267
Lucy always wanted
you out of Chinatown.

33:27.350 --> 33:29.561
I don't think going broke
was what she had in mind.

33:47.996 --> 33:50.082
It's no fun
having to live with eyes

33:50.165 --> 33:51.249
in the back of your head.

33:51.333 --> 33:52.542
No shit.

33:52.625 --> 33:56.088
I like being
the boss way better.

33:56.171 --> 33:57.630
So did I.

34:00.592 --> 34:03.178
But we have bigger problems.

34:05.638 --> 34:07.765
Is that our ride?

34:11.478 --> 34:13.730
These poor bastards.

34:13.813 --> 34:16.941
They gave up everything
to cross the salt.

34:18.360 --> 34:19.902
They came looking
for the gold mountain

34:19.987 --> 34:21.904
only to find a pile of shit.

34:21.989 --> 34:25.200
Now they're being sent back
to another pile.

34:26.868 --> 34:28.786
What'll happen
to us in China?

34:28.870 --> 34:30.872
Nothing good.

34:30.955 --> 34:34.667
We either die quick
at the hands of enemies

34:34.751 --> 34:38.088
or slow through disease
and starvation.

34:39.506 --> 34:42.634
I always figured they'd send
my body back to China

34:42.717 --> 34:45.470
when I was dead.

34:45.553 --> 34:49.176
That's the only way
I'm going back, get me?

34:50.392 --> 34:52.560
When they herd us
onto that boat,

34:52.644 --> 34:55.105
we make a break for it.

34:57.149 --> 34:59.151
What if we can't
get past those guards?

35:06.949 --> 35:09.161
We take out as many
of them as we can.

35:09.244 --> 35:11.413
Go out strong.

35:18.503 --> 35:20.880
Go out strong.

35:37.064 --> 35:39.066
It's OK.

35:47.324 --> 35:50.743
So how was jail?

35:52.745 --> 35:56.624
I didn't care for it,
so I left.

35:59.961 --> 36:02.464
I'm glad you got out.

36:07.552 --> 36:09.554
Thanks.

36:11.258 --> 36:13.683
It's funny though.

36:13.766 --> 36:15.852
When I got locked up,

36:15.935 --> 36:18.855
I couldn't just leave
until you got me out.

36:23.568 --> 36:26.363
You.

36:26.446 --> 36:30.117
You bought yourself
some serious connections.

36:30.200 --> 36:33.120
Bulls, the government,

36:33.203 --> 36:35.372
it's how you dodged
the crackdowns,

36:35.455 --> 36:38.708
and it's why
you're back on the street.

36:38.791 --> 36:40.335
I know you didn't
come here to tell me

36:40.418 --> 36:42.545
what I already know.

36:44.172 --> 36:46.174
Yeah.

36:50.345 --> 36:52.639
Young Jun's in some camp
waiting to be deported.

36:52.722 --> 36:54.391
I need you to get him out.

36:57.685 --> 37:01.273
I can't think of a single
reason why I'd do that.

37:01.356 --> 37:05.485
I can give you
a thousand reasons.

37:16.323 --> 37:18.831
Do we have a deal?

37:18.915 --> 37:20.327
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

37:20.417 --> 37:22.877
- Hey!
- Oh, don't worry.

37:24.331 --> 37:26.923
You can always print more.

37:28.758 --> 37:30.510
What, you didn't think
your little operation

37:30.593 --> 37:31.969
would stay secret from me,
did you?

37:32.054 --> 37:34.931
OK.

37:35.015 --> 37:37.725
- What's it gonna take?
- Half.

37:39.519 --> 37:40.812
Half? Half of what?

37:40.895 --> 37:43.856
Of everything moving forward.

37:45.483 --> 37:49.529
Come on, Young Jun,
he'll never go for that.

37:49.612 --> 37:52.991
Young Jun is about
to cross the salt permanently.

37:53.075 --> 37:56.744
I'd say 50%
is the deal of a lifetime.

37:58.538 --> 38:00.540
Ah Sahm.

38:04.002 --> 38:08.548
You tell Young Jun this was
the only way because it was.

38:09.799 --> 38:12.379
And we become partners.

38:14.846 --> 38:16.556
Partners?

38:16.639 --> 38:19.267
And what do you bring
to the table?

38:19.351 --> 38:22.895
Besides saving
your boss's life,

38:22.979 --> 38:27.067
the Long Zii will provide
a space to continue printing

38:27.150 --> 38:30.320
free from police interference.

38:30.397 --> 38:34.741
Like you said,
I have the connections.

38:34.824 --> 38:37.535
You and I can finally be
on the same side.

38:37.619 --> 38:41.206
We can all get rich together,

38:41.289 --> 38:44.709
or Young Jun
can take his chances in China.

38:56.423 --> 38:58.806
Thanks for coming.

38:58.890 --> 39:01.018
You look beautiful.

39:02.310 --> 39:05.105
What's all this about,
for God's sake?

39:05.188 --> 39:06.856
Don't get me wrong,
it's lovely.

39:06.939 --> 39:09.359
But you're scaring me.

39:16.074 --> 39:18.076
Here you are.

39:26.376 --> 39:31.256
I told you once, I had it
in me to be a better man.

39:31.339 --> 39:35.677
And I thought
I was trying to be.

39:35.760 --> 39:40.515
Hell, I even believed
maybe I was sometimes.

39:43.101 --> 39:44.561
I guess that's why
I was clinging so hard

39:44.644 --> 39:46.563
to being a cop.

39:46.646 --> 39:52.152
I thought that no matter
what I did wrong,

39:52.235 --> 39:54.571
I had that.

39:54.654 --> 39:57.740
Something good.

39:57.824 --> 40:00.118
But it's not.

40:00.202 --> 40:03.997
It's not good because
of what it did to me,

40:04.081 --> 40:06.833
to us,

40:06.916 --> 40:09.086
and I am no good without you.

40:09.169 --> 40:11.171
I...

40:13.756 --> 40:15.883
You and the kids are the only
thing that matter to me,

40:15.967 --> 40:19.506
and in all the mess,
I lost sight of that.

40:19.596 --> 40:22.265
I lost sight of you.

40:22.349 --> 40:25.602
- Bill--
- Let me finish, please.

40:29.939 --> 40:33.026
I quit my job,
turned in my badge.

40:33.110 --> 40:36.154
I'll work for Horace.
I'll do whatever it takes.

40:36.238 --> 40:39.282
I just--
come back, and I swear to you,

40:39.366 --> 40:42.327
I will never lose sight
of you again.

40:49.959 --> 40:51.961
Luce?

41:08.686 --> 41:11.189
Quit or fired?

41:11.273 --> 41:14.484
I suppose
that's open for debate.

41:15.777 --> 41:17.945
So was that a yes then?

41:18.030 --> 41:20.823
Yes. That's a yes.

41:26.413 --> 41:29.416
Do you like it?

41:38.175 --> 41:41.053
This is for you.

41:41.136 --> 41:42.804
Please. Here.

42:00.738 --> 42:02.740
Lai.

42:07.829 --> 42:10.665
She's still angry.

42:10.748 --> 42:13.501
And I think she blame me.

42:13.585 --> 42:16.623
It's not your fault.

42:16.713 --> 42:20.258
Strickland and his men
did this, not you.

42:20.342 --> 42:23.178
Men attack us.

42:23.261 --> 42:26.348
I do something worse.

42:26.431 --> 42:28.683
I give her hope.

42:28.766 --> 42:32.229
What Lai and these girls
had in Sonoma,

42:32.312 --> 42:35.148
that's the life they deserve.

42:35.232 --> 42:37.484
You say.

42:37.567 --> 42:41.029
But your law is not for us.

42:41.113 --> 42:44.241
What happen in court?

42:44.324 --> 42:46.701
The government took the land.

42:48.328 --> 42:50.830
Maybe law not for you either.

42:50.913 --> 42:53.291
Rich and powerful men
like Strickland

42:53.375 --> 42:56.003
will always find a way
to put a thumb on the scale.

42:56.086 --> 42:59.089
But we can rebuild.

42:59.172 --> 43:02.300
I found another piece
of land further up the coast.

43:02.384 --> 43:05.887
50 acres with good soil.

43:05.970 --> 43:08.390
I was thinking we could
take a look tomorrow.

43:17.732 --> 43:20.860
No.

43:20.943 --> 43:24.281
I not make same mistake twice.

43:28.201 --> 43:30.745
What are you saying?

43:32.699 --> 43:35.667
Better you not
come here anymore

43:35.750 --> 43:37.544
for the girls.

43:37.627 --> 43:39.546
For the girls?

43:39.629 --> 43:42.674
Or for you?

43:42.757 --> 43:45.343
For all of us.

43:53.601 --> 43:55.520
Let's go, let's go!

43:55.603 --> 43:57.397
- Move along.
- Look at me, move.

43:57.480 --> 43:59.566
I said,
move your fucking asses!

43:59.649 --> 44:01.985
- Let's go!
- Filthy rats, come on!

44:02.069 --> 44:03.695
Let's go!

44:03.778 --> 44:05.822
- This way!
- Come on!

44:05.905 --> 44:09.867
Come on!
Come on, move it!

44:09.951 --> 44:12.120
Wait until we pass the gate.

44:12.204 --> 44:14.706
Then we take out the bulls
with the rifles.

44:14.789 --> 44:17.209
- You get me?
- I get you.

44:19.002 --> 44:22.172
Come on now, this way!

44:22.255 --> 44:24.716
- Keep moving!
- Get your hands off me!

44:46.821 --> 44:49.199
Stop, stop!

44:49.282 --> 44:51.451
Stop!
Let me through.

44:51.534 --> 44:52.779
Hold here!

44:52.869 --> 44:54.329
What the hell
is going on here?

44:54.412 --> 44:56.206
You're the guy to talk to?

44:56.289 --> 44:58.291
Court order, right?

45:12.722 --> 45:15.850
Greetings from Ah Sahm.

45:15.933 --> 45:18.186
You're coming with me.

45:25.527 --> 45:27.814
He come too.

45:29.072 --> 45:30.365
That's not the deal.

45:30.448 --> 45:32.617
New deal.

45:32.700 --> 45:35.996
I can't just walk
out of here with both of you.

45:36.079 --> 45:39.124
New deal.

45:48.091 --> 45:49.509
You're angry.

45:49.592 --> 45:54.639
Good, be angry,
but don't be stupid.

45:56.183 --> 45:59.977
We need more time to plan,
to heal

46:00.062 --> 46:03.481
because anger won't be enough.

46:03.565 --> 46:06.234
He will pay for what he
did to them, I promise you.

46:06.318 --> 46:08.820
But not now.

46:18.663 --> 46:21.624
Lai, you're not ready.

46:26.421 --> 46:28.423
And neither am I.

46:59.079 --> 47:01.581
Welcome back, motherfucker!

47:01.664 --> 47:04.959
Oh, fuck on, you dog cunt.

47:05.043 --> 47:06.961
Sorry, boss.

47:07.045 --> 47:09.172
It's just so damn good
to see you.

47:09.256 --> 47:11.383
Even if you do
look like shit.

47:11.466 --> 47:13.593
- Yeah, yeah.
- Come here.

47:13.676 --> 47:16.346
Enjoy it while you can.

47:18.056 --> 47:20.183
We all know that I'm still
the prettiest motherfucker

47:20.267 --> 47:21.601
in Chinatown.

47:25.480 --> 47:29.401
Seriously, though, how
the hell did you pull that off?

47:31.444 --> 47:34.406
Yeah, uh...

47:40.947 --> 47:43.873
- Father Jun.
- Ah Sahm.

47:45.625 --> 47:47.669
Hong.

47:50.172 --> 47:53.633
Thank you for getting us
the fuck out of there.

48:00.348 --> 48:02.475
So what's the story, man?

48:02.559 --> 48:05.062
How the hell did you two
end up in there together?

48:10.525 --> 48:13.195
Whiskey, Hong.

48:13.278 --> 48:16.948
Whiskey and sticky.

48:17.032 --> 48:18.950
And all the rest can wait.

48:19.034 --> 48:20.618
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

48:20.702 --> 48:23.496
I can walk.

48:23.580 --> 48:26.124
You need a bath first.

48:35.508 --> 48:38.886
You made another deal
without telling me.

48:38.970 --> 48:43.808
I know how it looks,
but I didn't plan this.

48:43.891 --> 48:47.014
Ah Sahm came to me.

48:47.104 --> 48:49.314
I'll be able
to pay back what I lost,

48:49.397 --> 48:54.319
which should appease
the elders and, hopefully...

48:54.402 --> 48:57.322
Make peace with your brother.

49:02.702 --> 49:06.123
I've put you through a lot.

49:06.206 --> 49:08.208
I know that.

49:09.834 --> 49:12.712
But you have
always protected me.

49:14.506 --> 49:17.009
I haven't made it easy.

49:17.092 --> 49:20.387
When I was sitting
in that cell alone,

49:20.470 --> 49:25.225
wondering if I'd
ever see you again,

49:25.308 --> 49:31.231
I realized,
you're the only person I trust,

49:31.314 --> 49:34.442
the only person
I've ever loved.

49:37.529 --> 49:40.115
I want us to get married.

49:43.451 --> 49:47.039
I think it's time, don't you?

49:53.080 --> 49:55.213
I do.

50:17.235 --> 50:18.820
Yeah!

50:18.903 --> 50:21.031
It's good to be back!

50:22.365 --> 50:24.576
Oh!

50:27.037 --> 50:29.747
See you later.

50:36.963 --> 50:40.127
I am glad you are back.

50:44.721 --> 50:46.973
It was a close fucking call.

50:47.057 --> 50:49.059
Yeah.

50:54.856 --> 50:56.858
You good?

50:58.568 --> 51:00.862
You made a deal
with Mai Ling.

51:07.660 --> 51:09.746
Think I wanted to go to her?

51:09.829 --> 51:11.373
It was the only move I had.

51:11.456 --> 51:12.832
Bullshit.

51:12.915 --> 51:15.162
You were sitting on stacks
of fucking fake cash.

51:15.252 --> 51:17.462
You could have bought every
single guard in that place.

51:17.545 --> 51:18.755
Come on.

51:18.838 --> 51:20.298
Maybe if I had two months
instead of two days.

51:20.382 --> 51:23.885
You gave away the fucking
store to our worst enemy,

51:23.968 --> 51:26.721
who happens to be your sister.

51:26.804 --> 51:28.931
What the fuck
am I supposed to think?

51:29.016 --> 51:30.225
Don't talk to me
about thinking.

51:30.308 --> 51:31.601
Now you want to think?

51:31.684 --> 51:32.935
Maybe you
should've been thinking,

51:33.020 --> 51:35.022
leader of the Hop Wei,

51:35.105 --> 51:36.648
before you got yourself
thrown in a camp

51:36.731 --> 51:39.359
for starting a fight
with the fucking police chief.

51:41.611 --> 51:44.447
You know, I could have let them
put you on that fucking boat

51:44.531 --> 51:46.574
and taken over the tong
if I wanted to.

51:46.658 --> 51:49.577
Would have been
the easiest thing in the world.

51:50.870 --> 51:53.165
I didn't make this deal
with Mai Ling.

51:53.248 --> 51:55.625
You did.

52:04.342 --> 52:05.552
I was thinking
I'd be bad cop,

52:05.635 --> 52:07.387
unless you feel
like playing against type.

52:07.470 --> 52:08.846
Chao doesn't
respond to threats.

52:08.930 --> 52:10.390
Might be better
he thinks I'm alone.

52:10.473 --> 52:12.642
OK then, you can be the hero.

52:12.725 --> 52:15.770
I'll head around back
in case he gets cold feet.

52:25.989 --> 52:28.325
You should really consider
locking your door.

52:28.408 --> 52:32.287
No need.
Chao is friend to everyone.

52:32.370 --> 52:33.580
Drink?

52:33.663 --> 52:34.998
You sent word
you had information.

52:35.082 --> 52:36.708
I'd just as soon take it
and be on my way.

52:36.791 --> 52:40.295
Oh.
All business, huh?

52:40.378 --> 52:43.173
Is OK.
Chao is businessman too.

52:43.250 --> 52:45.925
- You bring money?
- Tell me what you know.

52:46.009 --> 52:49.887
Then we can discuss a fee.

52:49.971 --> 52:53.016
Thought you want new
relationship with Chao, no?

52:53.100 --> 52:55.893
I know
that you're part of all this.

52:55.977 --> 52:57.687
What I don't know
is why I'd believe anything

52:57.770 --> 53:00.232
you tell me now.

53:00.315 --> 53:03.485
Already too many cop
in Chinatown.

53:03.568 --> 53:06.779
Fake money bring even more.
Bad for business.

53:06.863 --> 53:11.784
Give me a name right now,
or I'm walking out that door.

53:11.868 --> 53:13.703
I don't think you are.

53:16.956 --> 53:19.042
Ahh! Ah-ah-ah-ah.

53:19.126 --> 53:20.918
Bad idea, cop.

53:21.003 --> 53:22.587
Bad idea.

53:22.670 --> 53:24.589
You set me up.

53:28.551 --> 53:33.681
As you say, Agent Lee,
new badge, new rules.

53:47.862 --> 53:52.367
You know, Chao,
I have a confession to make.

53:55.495 --> 53:59.124
I'm still pissed
about the fake cash.

53:59.207 --> 54:03.878
Jack, that's why
I paid you twice.

54:03.961 --> 54:06.548
I know. I know.

54:06.631 --> 54:09.467
But it's the principle
of the thing.

54:09.551 --> 54:11.261
Now you have principle?

54:13.888 --> 54:16.099
Fuck me.
