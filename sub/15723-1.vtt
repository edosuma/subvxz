Episodes 01 & 02 :
Baby Bomb & Spare Parts.

01:32.718 --> 01:33.635
Joe.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.972
Joe, if you're there, pick up, okay?

01:38.223 --> 01:40.517
I need you to go out and
see if that body's still there.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.146
Be careful, all right?
Don't touch it.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.319
Where are you man?
Been up to the gravesite yet?

01:50.944 --> 01:52.946
But call okay?
Call me as soon as you get this.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.005
Hey, Jill, it's me.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.429
I just wanted to call you.

02:19.932 --> 02:21.183
How... uh...

02:24.811 --> 02:26.021
I love you.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.112
I just wanted to call
and say that.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.164
Hey Jill, it's me.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.125
Uh, I really need to talk to you.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.420
If you haven't figured it out by now...

02:52.214 --> 02:53.549
Shit, I can explain.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.344
I really fucked up this time.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.430
Really...

03:01.598 --> 03:03.183
I really fucked up this time.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.060
Call me.

03:10.983 --> 03:14.862
Okay Sandstrom,
get your shit together.

03:17.155 --> 03:20.409
You're going to go back to the lab
and tell them what's going on.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.163
Caroline.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.542
Call Caroline.

04:35.526 --> 04:36.818
Excuse me, can I help you?

04:37.653 --> 04:40.155
Please, sit down.
I'll get someone right away.

04:57.548 --> 04:58.131
Hello?

05:24.491 --> 05:27.035
That is so disturbing!

05:29.705 --> 05:30.497
Who is that?

05:31.540 --> 05:33.625
- Off. My daughter, Lilith.
- Shit!

05:41.175 --> 05:42.968
Well, no wonder I am so fucked up.

05:43.427 --> 05:44.636
What are you doing here?

05:44.678 --> 05:46.096
Oh, that's a really nice welcome.

05:46.138 --> 05:47.848
I guess you were too busy
to come pick me up.

05:47.973 --> 05:48.807
You didn't tell me you were coming.

05:49.057 --> 05:49.850
- Yes, I did.
- When?

05:50.267 --> 05:50.976
I...

05:55.314 --> 05:57.441
- Hi, Sally.
- Oh, Jesus.

05:58.734 --> 05:59.443
Uh, Twyla.

06:01.987 --> 06:02.654
Yeah.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.408
How long ago?

06:07.451 --> 06:08.619
Okay, are you there now?

06:09.578 --> 06:11.205
Carlos, yeah, I want him there too.

06:12.331 --> 06:14.249
Okay, you call him. I'm on my way.

06:28.931 --> 06:31.433
- Where you going?
- Huh? Oh, airport.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.519
Oh, what? To pick someone up?

06:34.728 --> 06:35.938
No, I gotta go to work.

06:37.189 --> 06:39.316
David, I mean... she just... got...

06:39.650 --> 06:40.984
Oh yeah, yeah, listen.

06:41.235 --> 06:43.695
You two get to know each other
and I'll be back...

06:44.905 --> 06:45.864
later.

06:47.699 --> 06:48.116
Bye.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.421
I hate helicopters.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.552
I hate riding with people
who hate helicopters.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.223
Tower, I've got the NorBAC
scientist on board.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.592
Caroline should be waiting
for us at the airport.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.602
- How was the trip?
- Let's not get into it.

07:56.810 --> 07:57.561
What do you got?

07:57.811 --> 07:59.438
All the victims seems
to be North of here.

07:59.473 --> 08:00.022
Okay.

08:00.272 --> 08:03.358
No one's recovered, 3 dead.
Original diagnosis was some kind of pox.

08:03.859 --> 08:04.443
But?

08:04.693 --> 08:07.321
Winnipeg came back negative for any of
the pox viruses that affect humans.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.781
- What about Atlanta?
- They I.D.'d it as camel pox.

08:10.532 --> 08:13.035
- Human beings don't get camel pox.
- They do now.

08:13.285 --> 08:16.705
They tried treating it with the drug cidofovir.
It works on the virus in camels.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.124
No effect on the victims and
they can't figure out why.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.585
Has anyone been outside of Canada
to the Middle East?

08:21.793 --> 08:24.254
- Or a zoo maybe?
- The latest victim hasn't been anywhere.

08:24.588 --> 08:27.341
Okay, so we've got a virus that shouldn't
infect people, but does,

08:27.591 --> 08:29.134
and a cure that should work, but doesn't.

08:29.968 --> 08:32.971
- What's causing it or how it's spread.
- Other than that...

08:35.557 --> 08:37.934
Patient 4: Darryl Graves, 16, student.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.605
Works part-time at a gas station
on highway 17.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.067
Left work yesterday around 6
with a fever.

08:45.651 --> 08:48.946
Brought himself here last night at 11:30
covered in pox.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.615
- Okay, I got it. It moves fast.
- How about the others?

08:52.449 --> 08:56.119
- All died within 36 hours.
- Connect this guy to the other 3 victims.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.205
There were all connected.
Not this boy.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.500
Excuse me, could you turn him
to the side please.

09:03.544 --> 09:04.586
Oh, Jesus.

09:12.511 --> 09:13.303
Carlos!

09:17.474 --> 09:19.893
I have to call the CDC.
What do I tell them?

09:20.102 --> 09:22.396
Whatever you want. Let's get
those samples from pathology.

09:25.858 --> 09:29.361
- When did you and my dad hook up?
- About 3 months ago.

09:30.279 --> 09:33.282
That's a really long time for him.

09:43.208 --> 09:48.088
- Sally is this Jell-O or an experiment?
- My name's Twyla.

09:49.423 --> 09:50.591
And it's aspic.

09:54.803 --> 09:58.056
Um, so where do you live anyway?

09:58.348 --> 10:00.058
Far. Manhattan.

10:00.893 --> 10:01.643
Right.

10:04.146 --> 10:10.068
You know, actually I live
on Salt Spring Island, near Vancouver.

10:11.612 --> 10:12.988
- Cool.
- No.

10:14.573 --> 10:18.035
The adults are all old hippies
and the kids are all skater losers.

10:24.082 --> 10:27.503
So, what? Did my dad pick you up in a bar
or his health club...?

10:27.836 --> 10:31.048
- We met professionally.
- Oh, you're a molecular biologist.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.050
I'm his physiotherapist.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.639
So that was therapy then?

10:56.823 --> 10:59.368
Let's treat is as a Bio-3 until we know
what we're dealing with, all right?

10:59.660 --> 11:00.160
Sure.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.538
- Uh, Dr. Sandstrom?
- Maybe.

11:02.746 --> 11:03.914
Can I speak to you about something?

11:05.040 --> 11:05.958
Speak.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.419
- Uh, I sent you an email.
- And I get hundreds a day kid.

11:09.628 --> 11:11.255
- I don't read half of them.
- Listen.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.633
- I need your help.
- Because?

11:15.551 --> 11:17.427
- Because I'm dying.
- I'm sorry.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.597
- Please help me.
- Kid, I'm a molecular biologist.

11:20.931 --> 11:24.101
I know all about you. You're the best
genetic scientist in the country.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.063
Look, I'm dying 'cause I'm a clone.

11:29.565 --> 11:31.316
- Say again.
- Like Dolly.

11:31.567 --> 11:34.903
- She died 'cause she was a clone.
- Dolly died because she was euthanized.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.447
She had a lung problem.
And she was a clone,

11:38.866 --> 11:40.200
- and you're not.
- I am!

11:40.784 --> 11:43.078
Look! Just look at this picture
of me and my brother.

11:44.830 --> 11:47.416
Amazing.
Two brothers who look alike.

11:51.003 --> 11:53.630
You do need help kid.
I'm not that kind of doctor.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.675
Dr. Sandstrom, sir, please just...

12:01.972 --> 12:03.182
- I'll get started.
- Right.

12:03.765 --> 12:04.766
- Bob.
- From Oxford.

12:05.309 --> 12:07.311
Oh yeah, Cort says the colamine is NAH Lab.

12:07.603 --> 12:09.313
He knows about a new strain
of monkey pox.

12:09.646 --> 12:12.482
- Okay, what about that flu sequencing.
- Oh, I just broke down the French strain.

12:12.733 --> 12:15.068
- No one's answering at UCB or Stanford yet.
- Wake 'em up. Anything?

12:15.277 --> 12:17.487
- Closer to West Nile than Spanish.
- Shit.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.365
Look up this drug, I want every
report you can find on it.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.743
The results are on your desk.
Perfect. I want you on this, okay ?

12:23.035 --> 12:24.870
You do the sequencing
while Carlos does the pathology.

12:25.162 --> 12:28.415
Lil, Air Canada 3551, 10:34 P.M.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.000
Fuck.

12:31.335 --> 12:34.713
- The other side.
- Cidofovir. Oh yeah.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.466
- And uh..., Twyla called.
- Yes.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.311
Did you know that camel pox is
the closest virus to small pox?

12:49.728 --> 12:52.981
- Maybe that's why people are getting it.
- That or too much humping.

12:53.065 --> 12:56.109
You know that's where IUD came from.
Camel drivers used to insert pebbles

12:56.276 --> 12:58.862
into the uteruses of camels to keep them
from getting pregnant.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.491
How'd they figure that out?

13:05.118 --> 13:06.995
It's going to be a long day.

13:07.871 --> 13:10.374
Carlos, people with Asperger's
Syndrome can't help it.

13:10.916 --> 13:13.585
You know, the Iraqis are working
on strains that infected people.

13:14.586 --> 13:17.130
- Does David know this?
- I don't know.

14:00.549 --> 14:04.720
- This is camel pox. Patient 4.
- Identical.

14:05.304 --> 14:06.972
Except that boy
has a hemorrhagic fever.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.517
The Lassa or Marburg, probably both.

14:10.767 --> 14:14.021
Serrano, poxes look like bricks.
Hemorrhagics look like worms.

14:14.229 --> 14:17.441
- Do these bricks look like worms to you?
- No, but they're acting like worms.

14:17.691 --> 14:20.611
I was in Africa with Medecins
Sans Frontieres. That pool of blood.

14:20.861 --> 14:23.947
With Ebola you leak
blood out of every orifice.

14:24.323 --> 14:26.742
- Poxes cause internal bleeding too.
- This wasn't bleeding,

14:26.909 --> 14:28.911
it was a complete vascular meltdown.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.335
If you open that boy up,

14:30.370 --> 14:33.123
his organs will look like
they've been put through a blender.

14:33.290 --> 14:34.374
Ebola?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.294
This meant his liver and kidney's
leaking out of him

14:37.878 --> 14:39.880
and that would explain
the failure of cidofovir.

14:40.214 --> 14:44.218
- Ebola and camel pox together?
- Maybe a genetic hybrid of the two.

14:44.885 --> 14:47.721
No, camel pox is made of DNA,
Ebola's made of RNA.

14:47.971 --> 14:50.599
The two split and went their separate ways
over 2 billion years ago.

14:51.016 --> 14:53.435
- Maybe they've kissed and made up.
- A variant?

14:53.685 --> 14:56.021
No, or maybe it's not Ebola
and maybe it's not even camel pox.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.441
Okay, where do we start?

15:03.612 --> 15:05.614
The minister of health wants you
to phone her and so does the CDC.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.991
- The rest are just urgent.
- Thanks, Wes.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.244
Patient 4, the Grave's boy,

15:10.494 --> 15:12.746
his mother was just admitted to
the hospital covered in pox.

15:14.915 --> 15:15.457
Okay.

15:16.834 --> 15:18.752
Credit card receipts from
the gas station where he worked,

15:19.461 --> 15:21.421
surveillance tape from the garage.

15:22.339 --> 15:24.341
I'll run a trace on all the cars
and quarantine the occupants.

15:24.675 --> 15:26.677
Go wider. Include anyone
they were in contact with.

15:31.265 --> 15:33.308
Hey, so this is what we know so far.

15:33.934 --> 15:37.563
Victim 1: Elmer Jones.
Owns a grocery store off highway 17.

15:37.896 --> 15:41.483
Lives alone. Tuesday morning he feels sick,
goes to C.U., Dr. William Parton.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.903
Dr. Parton sends Elmer to
Northway Health Centre here,

15:45.404 --> 15:47.155
admitting nurse is Katherine Holochuck.

15:47.698 --> 15:51.785
Now those are victims 1-2 and 3.
A straight flow of events... until Darryl.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.913
150 clicks away. All of these
people are in quarantine now?

15:55.330 --> 15:57.749
Except the question marks,
we're still searching for them.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.919
Now what we have to know is why
did it suddenly jump to Darryl.

16:01.420 --> 16:03.589
Does this mean one of these people
infected someone

16:03.964 --> 16:06.049
who drove down
the highway and gave it to Darryl?

16:06.216 --> 16:08.594
And or is there is one person,
a patient zero, who's spreading it?

16:09.845 --> 16:13.056
Caroline. Patient 4, Darryl,
he just died.

16:29.907 --> 16:32.242
You're talking about nature
somehow accidentally combining,

16:32.784 --> 16:36.580
- say, a flea and an elephant.
- I'm not saying it makes sense,

16:37.080 --> 16:39.208
just it makes more sense than
anything else I've heard.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.168
Okay, how about this ?

16:45.964 --> 16:51.553
A single strand RNA Ebola-like intermediate
somehow might get copied

16:52.804 --> 16:58.435
on a cellular reverse transcriptase and then
integrated into the genome. Okay?

16:59.311 --> 17:01.146
- Okay, but what if--
- Okay, just a second.

17:01.480 --> 17:05.983
Now, camel pox, it might somehow
super infect the same cell,

17:08.569 --> 17:11.490
and then some kind of recombination occurs.

17:11.656 --> 17:14.117
I mean, I know we're talking about
nuclear and cytoplasmic replication,

17:14.409 --> 17:15.911
but hey, you never know, right?

17:16.662 --> 17:19.915
No. David, you know there's no way that
the camel pox variant could accommodate

17:20.249 --> 17:22.251
the extra genomic burden you're
giving it. There's no way.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.546
Ockham's Razor.

17:27.047 --> 17:29.466
The simplest explanation is best. Fuck.

17:30.509 --> 17:31.927
- I need more coffee.
- You want one?

17:32.177 --> 17:33.470
I've got to call my daughter.

17:34.263 --> 17:35.264
You're a father?

17:36.849 --> 17:37.766
Sort of.

17:44.022 --> 17:46.733
- David.
- Oh hey, come on in.

17:48.277 --> 17:50.571
I got a lead on a sample of
the Spanish lady.

17:51.154 --> 17:52.906
- From where?
- It's a long story.

17:54.950 --> 17:56.285
Have you guys made any progress?

17:58.787 --> 18:01.290
Eliminated a few hypothesis, you?

18:02.332 --> 18:06.712
Positive on CP, negative on Ebola.
We've PCR'ed the hell out of it, David.

18:07.004 --> 18:08.964
I don't think there's any Ebola there.

18:08.999 --> 18:10.424
I think Carlos is wrong.

18:11.008 --> 18:12.301
Yeah, maybe.

18:35.407 --> 18:36.241
Okay, call me tonight.

18:38.535 --> 18:38.952
Okay, bye.

18:50.881 --> 18:52.341
I didn't know you smoke.

18:52.966 --> 18:53.884
I don't.

18:54.510 --> 18:55.427
Neither do I.

18:57.221 --> 18:59.515
I would think an MD
would know better.

19:00.098 --> 19:02.434
I do, I do. I'm quitting.

19:02.851 --> 19:03.560
Again.

19:04.937 --> 19:06.563
So, how do you like it here?

19:07.272 --> 19:10.984
Ah, I miss Mexico City a little.
The sushi was better.

19:11.860 --> 19:13.028
Any regrets?

19:14.905 --> 19:17.282
If I want to do the best,
I have to be with the best.

19:17.866 --> 19:19.827
You didn't answer my question.

19:20.244 --> 19:22.454
I have no regrets
working with David Sandstrom.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.417
Someone has to teach him
how to do things.

19:30.504 --> 19:32.172
So, how are we doing in there?

19:33.006 --> 19:35.551
Well, I have my theory,
David has his.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.721
Eventually, you run out of wrongs,
you end up right.

19:41.723 --> 19:44.977
- I hope eventually is soon, Carlos.
- Yeah.

19:46.687 --> 19:49.314
- Mierda. See you inside.
- Yeah.

19:56.154 --> 19:57.865
We've gone through it twice now.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.367
We definitely have PCR evidence
for camel pox DNA,

20:00.576 --> 20:02.536
but no evidence at all for any Ebola.

20:03.203 --> 20:04.955
What about other hemorrhagic
fever viruses?

20:05.122 --> 20:06.874
- Nothing.
- When you were at Fort Egan,

20:06.957 --> 20:08.792
- did you ever see anything like this?
- Never.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.628
Isn't it time we give up on this idea?
We're getting nowhere.

20:11.879 --> 20:14.673
We have no material evidence.
We have no theoretical model.

20:18.927 --> 20:19.678
What?

20:20.012 --> 20:22.139
Oh hey, Twyla,
can I call you back later?

20:23.557 --> 20:24.641
I don't know.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.562
Actually that was a good answer.
Here's a better one.

20:33.317 --> 20:35.194
- What?
- Look at this.

20:40.699 --> 20:42.868
...cell align with the pox
variant components,

20:43.702 --> 20:45.496
and then we take the Ebola virus...

20:46.663 --> 20:48.207
packaging sequences...

20:49.833 --> 20:52.085
and we'll super infect...

20:53.045 --> 20:54.421
okay...

20:55.589 --> 20:58.091
divide... pox...

21:00.135 --> 21:01.553
Where did that come from?

21:02.346 --> 21:04.431
I don't know, it just kind of
popped into my head.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.226
- Virus ! It's a virus.
- Too crazy?

21:09.019 --> 21:10.646
Yeah... well.

21:13.065 --> 21:14.942
- Hira?
- Possible.

21:15.692 --> 21:17.110
Simple enough?

21:18.278 --> 21:19.696
Maybe too simple.

21:22.074 --> 21:24.618
Thank you. Let's do it.

21:36.380 --> 21:39.591
- What?
- Sorry, it's mine.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.596
So, what? Are you guys like
broken up or...?

21:44.847 --> 21:48.350
I don't know, your father isn't really equipped
to deal with that kind of conversation.

21:48.642 --> 21:49.852
Yeah, I know.

21:53.730 --> 21:55.023
So, what? Are you leaving?

21:55.232 --> 21:57.276
Yeah, well, I don't want
to get too comfortable.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.652
Why not?

22:01.071 --> 22:04.700
- You don't know him at all, do you?
- Oh yeah, I know him.

22:06.451 --> 22:08.912
David has room for 2 things in his life:

22:09.037 --> 22:10.831
His science and himself.

22:11.498 --> 22:14.501
The rest is just shit that gets in the way
or gets used and thrown out.

22:15.002 --> 22:16.336
That's your dad, honey.

22:17.671 --> 22:21.425
So, once you figure out where you fit,
you do what you got to do, right?

22:22.551 --> 22:23.218
Ciao.

22:26.096 --> 22:27.139
Goodbye, Twyla.

22:27.806 --> 22:28.807
It's Sally.

22:54.208 --> 22:55.876
- What's wrong?
- It's not working.

22:56.585 --> 22:59.296
- Not even my card.
- Maybe your face is changing.

23:00.172 --> 23:02.382
I mean those face recognition things
are very sensitive.

23:02.883 --> 23:03.967
- Can you try?
- Sure.

23:16.355 --> 23:18.023
So, either quarantine the school

23:18.065 --> 23:20.108
or I'll get somebody to
quarantine the whole town.

23:22.819 --> 23:25.155
Three countries came
together to back this lab

23:25.322 --> 23:27.574
but you can't get one school closed.

23:28.325 --> 23:29.201
Shit.

23:33.413 --> 23:36.875
It's Caroline Morrison at NorBAC. I need the
medical officer of health's daily briefing.

23:37.334 --> 23:39.127
It was supposed to be sent to me.

23:39.586 --> 23:42.714
I'm not interested in excuses,
just do it please.

23:42.840 --> 23:43.549
Thank you.

23:47.052 --> 23:49.847
He touched her.
I'm going to put him on the list.

23:51.557 --> 23:53.642
- I wasn't sure you'd still be here.
- I was just leaving.

23:54.059 --> 23:55.936
- Anything?
- A couple of leads I want to check out.

23:56.562 --> 23:57.813
Oh, so where are we at?

23:58.772 --> 24:01.608
That boy we saw, Darryl,
his mother just died.

24:02.234 --> 24:06.029
So, that's seven dead,
four in critical condition,

24:06.655 --> 24:09.408
and so many in quarantine
I can't keep up.

24:11.451 --> 24:13.871
Two-hundred and fourteen.
What do you have?

24:15.539 --> 24:20.460
We had a theory. Unfortunately, we're
having a lot of difficulty proving it.

24:21.837 --> 24:24.173
Oh, and that Face First thingie
you put in? It's not working.

24:24.715 --> 24:25.966
What's wrong with it?

24:26.341 --> 24:28.260
I don't know.
Hira had a problem with it today.

24:29.386 --> 24:32.097
We're having trouble getting
her through a background check.

24:33.807 --> 24:36.560
- She was cleared 3 months ago.
- Yeah, well something's come up.

24:38.145 --> 24:41.481
Okay, would you please check with me
before you start playing around--

24:42.024 --> 24:46.278
David, not now. I'm juggling politicians,
health authorities and police departments.

24:46.612 --> 24:49.072
And I'm juggling camel pox,
Ebola and God knows what else

24:49.406 --> 24:51.658
and I'd like to have my best virologist
able to get into lock up.

24:51.909 --> 24:54.161
She's here,
she's just on limited access.

25:43.836 --> 25:45.128
What do you want?

25:46.713 --> 25:48.674
Hello, like, I asked you a question.

25:49.591 --> 25:50.843
Uh, I'm Mick.

25:52.636 --> 25:55.264
What? What, are you retarded?
I asked you what you wanted.

25:56.348 --> 25:57.933
Are you Dr. David Sandstrom's daughter ?

25:58.350 --> 25:59.268
No.

26:02.437 --> 26:06.608
Yes, maybe I am Dr. David Sandstrom's
daughter. Why? What do you want?

26:09.111 --> 26:10.654
I need to talk to him.

26:12.197 --> 26:14.741
- So talk to him.
- I've tried. I need help.

26:17.953 --> 26:18.912
Look, I'm dying.

26:20.539 --> 26:21.790
So is everyone.

26:22.875 --> 26:25.127
If no one died there wouldn't
really be enough room, you know?

26:25.544 --> 26:27.838
- Yeah, well, I'm dying now.
- Oh, like now now.

26:28.338 --> 26:31.008
Like if I don't get help
I won't make it till the end of the year.

26:33.051 --> 26:34.720
I really need your dad's help.

26:38.390 --> 26:41.185
Look, my dad's not even a doctor doctor.

26:41.727 --> 26:44.021
He's a PhD doctor and
they don't help anyone.

26:45.606 --> 26:48.317
I know but he'll know
how to help me because...

26:50.235 --> 26:52.988
- Yeah?
- I'm a clone.

26:56.742 --> 26:58.994
You actually almost had me
there for a second.

26:59.244 --> 27:01.079
Damn it, I'm a clone,
I can prove it!

27:02.039 --> 27:04.583
Look, you've got issues, okay?

27:18.931 --> 27:21.767
- Who are you not talking to?
- Ersky Labs in South Africa.

27:21.850 --> 27:22.726
Why?

27:23.101 --> 27:25.812
They have the most state of the art
automated DNA sequencer in Africa.

27:26.230 --> 27:28.774
Hemorrhagics come from Africa. I'm wondering
if they've ever seen anything like this.

27:29.149 --> 27:30.067
Clever.

27:31.276 --> 27:32.861
Hey! What's going on
with my security clearance?

27:33.278 --> 27:34.821
Oh, don't worry about it.
It's just bureaucratic bullshit,

27:35.405 --> 27:37.449
but if you run into any more bumps,
you let me know, okay?

27:39.243 --> 27:41.411
It almost becomes a
Ebola/camel pox chimera.

27:42.287 --> 27:45.165
- Serrano, no personal calls.
- Deiderman of Heidelberg.

27:46.416 --> 27:48.585
Microbiology's worst squash player.

27:50.254 --> 27:52.047
- Who are you talking to, Bob?
- My mother.

27:52.381 --> 27:54.007
- Does she have any ideas?
- Huh?

27:55.843 --> 27:58.554
Says your proposed chimera virus
is too unstable,

27:58.887 --> 28:01.139
it would never survive repeated passage
through people.

28:03.141 --> 28:06.937
Deiderman, yeah, Sandstrom.
Nothing wrong with being wrong, right?

28:08.355 --> 28:10.732
- Yeah, you'll get used to it.
- He's right, David.

28:10.983 --> 28:12.776
No way to fit the Ebola gene
only to the pox variant.

28:13.235 --> 28:15.863
- It's true, it's in there.
- Maybe not the way we're imagining it.

28:16.154 --> 28:17.865
- What fucking way?
- I don't know.

28:18.198 --> 28:20.284
I don't even know what
we're arguing about.

28:20.701 --> 28:23.871
Chimera, Ebola, camel pox together.

28:24.329 --> 28:27.332
But Hira can't confirm it with PCR.
What if this isn't Ebola?

28:27.499 --> 28:30.377
I'd like to base this on something
more reliable than Carlos' notes.

28:30.836 --> 28:33.755
Mayko's right, David. I ran
an analysis test on the serum,

28:34.214 --> 28:36.717
couldn't find any traces
of Ebola antibodies.

28:37.217 --> 28:41.138
There are no IGM or IGG antibodies, and
the immuno-chemistry tests came up negative.

28:41.597 --> 28:43.098
Then what are we saying?

28:43.640 --> 28:47.644
We're saying it was a brilliant hypothesis,
but my diagnosis was wrong.

29:02.868 --> 29:07.498
No. Carlos is right.
It's Ebola. It's there.

29:08.081 --> 29:09.583
- Yeah.
- How's it going?

29:10.000 --> 29:11.752
- Oh, fucking beautiful. You?
- Two more dead.

29:12.252 --> 29:14.838
- Shit, where are you?
- A restaurant in McClint.

29:15.422 --> 29:17.299
- So, it's on its way eh?
- Yeah.

29:18.050 --> 29:21.803
And I have politicians in denial with health
care professionals on the verge of panic.

29:22.387 --> 29:25.057
- What about your end?
- Uh, dead end.

29:25.349 --> 29:27.684
I can get you first samples in
a few hours. Will that help?

29:28.268 --> 29:31.313
Maybe. The damn virus
has evolved so fast.

29:32.564 --> 29:34.441
A mutation might shed some light.

29:35.234 --> 29:36.026
Bye.

29:37.778 --> 29:40.781
Okay, everybody,
go home, have a shower,

29:41.365 --> 29:45.327
feed your dog, change your underwear,
be back in an hour.

29:45.869 --> 29:47.830
We've got fresh samples coming in.

29:48.914 --> 29:50.916
I can get you first samples
in a few hours.

30:00.175 --> 30:00.968
Thank you.

30:01.635 --> 30:06.557
Well, the couple closed the diner at 9.
They were just making their own suppers.

30:07.724 --> 30:10.018
Steaks left on the grill
started a grease fire.

30:12.688 --> 30:15.232
I was supposed to meet
the local chief medical officer.

30:15.732 --> 30:18.235
- Well, she's on her way.
- She had to go by the hospital

30:18.485 --> 30:20.487
and check on how
they're setting up the quarantine.

30:44.094 --> 30:44.761
NorBAC?

31:04.990 --> 31:06.074
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, what?

31:07.034 --> 31:11.622
- This thing, what is it?
- That's what we're working on officer.

31:11.997 --> 31:14.666
I want this place sealed up.
No press, no pictures.

31:17.503 --> 31:19.505
- My son's in quarantine.
- Why?

31:20.130 --> 31:23.717
- Same school as Gerald Graves.
- It's just a precaution.

31:23.967 --> 31:27.137
Well, it's one hell of a precaution.
My wife's scared to death.

31:27.471 --> 31:30.140
- I understand.
- What do I tell her?

31:30.974 --> 31:33.894
- Is my boy going to be all right?
- We don't know enough about this yet.

31:34.520 --> 31:39.066
- I'm sorry, but that's the truth.
- Word is that Gerald died. Is that true?

31:39.274 --> 31:39.942
Yeah.

31:41.902 --> 31:46.615
Look, I appreciate your time.
I'll get to sealing this place up.

31:48.075 --> 31:49.576
Officer...

31:50.577 --> 31:51.912
Got a card?

31:52.621 --> 31:53.372
Yeah.

31:57.459 --> 32:00.170
- As soon as we know anything.
- Thank you.

32:25.028 --> 32:25.946
Lilith!

32:27.781 --> 32:28.824
Lilith!

32:34.288 --> 32:35.497
Hello?

32:38.876 --> 32:42.880
- You abandoned me.
- It had nothing to do with you.

32:43.046 --> 32:45.757
Your mom and I weren't getting along
and she's the one who moved out too,

32:46.091 --> 32:48.135
so if you've got abandonment issues,
take it up with her.

32:48.552 --> 32:50.470
Retard, I mean yesterday.

32:51.805 --> 32:54.808
- Oh. Uh, Twyla was here.
- Oh, right, right.

32:59.563 --> 33:02.691
You seriously must be
the worst father in the world.

33:04.067 --> 33:06.403
I come and what?
Within 10 seconds you're gone,

33:07.279 --> 33:10.282
and 24 hours later you're back.
Where were you?

33:10.991 --> 33:13.327
I was working on something
very, very important.

33:13.577 --> 33:14.495
Oh, and I'm not.

33:16.205 --> 33:18.207
- I need a beer.
- Yeah, me too.

33:19.583 --> 33:22.169
The fact is it's moving down
highway 17.

33:23.712 --> 33:27.799
Well, shutting down a highway's a good
precaution considering the consequences.

33:28.133 --> 33:31.512
That's nothing compared to
what happens if this virus hits Toronto.

33:31.887 --> 33:34.973
You sir, can hope for the best,
but my job is to plan for the worst.

33:36.642 --> 33:38.685
The sooner you get back to me,
the better.

33:42.064 --> 33:45.359
- Your mom got your email.
- Was she pissed?

33:45.651 --> 33:47.444
Did you want her to be?

33:49.363 --> 33:52.950
And you were right, I was supposed
to pick you up at the airport.

33:53.325 --> 33:55.369
I fucked up. I'm sorry.

33:58.497 --> 34:00.916
You can stay till the weekend
and then you've got to go.

34:01.667 --> 34:05.003
- No, I'm moving in.
- No. What?

34:05.379 --> 34:10.092
- No... look, there's a virus...
- Newsflash. Biology isn't everything.

34:10.467 --> 34:12.928
And I hate to break it to you
but you are my parent too.

34:13.178 --> 34:14.929
Yeah, but the one thing that
we both agree on is

34:15.179 --> 34:17.349
that I suck as a dad, and that's genetics.

34:21.228 --> 34:23.938
Oh yeah, when I went to the store today
I got stalked.

34:24.690 --> 34:27.985
- What?
- Yes, this guy... I don't know, this kid,

34:28.652 --> 34:31.780
he was like totally following me.
And then I got up in his face--

34:32.406 --> 34:34.324
- What did he want?
- You.

34:35.117 --> 34:37.703
Said he was dying and needed
to talk to you.

34:39.288 --> 34:43.375
- Is he a weird guy about 15?
- Well, all 15 year old guys are weird.

34:43.750 --> 34:45.835
Well, they don't get any
better until they're about 30.

34:45.878 --> 34:48.130
- Did he say he was a clone?
- Yeah, and then...

34:48.505 --> 34:51.175
- I mean, that's not possible, is it?
- Not unless he's from the future.

34:51.466 --> 34:52.801
Exactly what I thought.

35:03.353 --> 35:04.271
Morrison.

35:06.857 --> 35:08.817
I wouldn't use the word epidemic.

35:11.069 --> 35:14.239
There are some reported cases of
what appears to be a virus, yes.

35:14.573 --> 35:15.699
A pox virus.

35:16.909 --> 35:17.868
Don't know.

35:19.203 --> 35:21.038
Some fatalities, yes. Nine.

35:21.246 --> 35:22.915
Look, I'm trying to be
as straightforward as I can,

35:23.081 --> 35:25.209
but I will not tell you anything
that is not confirmed.

35:25.834 --> 35:28.045
The only thing certain is 9 dead.

35:29.963 --> 35:33.217
How many more? I don't know.

35:35.427 --> 35:36.553
Jesus.

35:38.388 --> 35:42.434
- So, explain this whole virus thing.
- It's very scary.

35:42.768 --> 35:45.187
What do you remember me
telling you about viruses?

35:46.772 --> 35:51.985
- Uh, dick all I guess.
- Okay, virology 101.

35:53.403 --> 35:58.784
Viruses are very small.
They're about a millionth of an inch.

35:59.201 --> 36:03.038
If this room was a cell, a virus would be
the size of a pinprick, okay.

36:03.413 --> 36:05.165
And what they do...

36:05.707 --> 36:11.588
what they do is they crawl in through
tiny, tiny holes. Say, right about there.

36:13.382 --> 36:15.676
- Okay. Uh, can you pass the chocolate?
- Uh, sure.

36:19.096 --> 36:24.518
So, they crawl in, okay,
and they steal some enzymes

36:25.435 --> 36:30.399
and they use them to make copies
of themselves. Thousands of copies.

36:31.149 --> 36:35.237
And with Ebola, which is what
we call a hemorrhagic or bleeding virus,

36:35.863 --> 36:39.032
eventually all those copies bust out.

36:39.491 --> 36:41.827
They blow about a thousand holes
through your cell walls,

36:42.703 --> 36:46.165
and then they float away and each of them
finds another cell to crawl into

36:46.540 --> 36:49.501
and make another thousand copies of itself,

36:49.536 --> 36:52.462
and a thousand thousand more holes and...

36:53.672 --> 36:58.260
...then pretty soon you're
bleeding and leaking to death

36:59.303 --> 37:01.221
inside your own skin.

37:03.599 --> 37:04.474
Yeesh.

37:06.894 --> 37:08.937
And that's what we're dealing with here,

37:09.646 --> 37:13.901
and that is why you really,
really have to go home to B.C.

37:15.819 --> 37:20.365
Dad, I would rather die of a virus
than of boredom in Salt Spring.

37:22.367 --> 37:24.703
I've got to go back to work.

37:25.287 --> 37:30.959
Dad, it's just that mum is dating
this like totally boring base player guy

37:31.502 --> 37:36.548
who wears way too much cologne and...
like, he calls me Lily.

37:37.090 --> 37:42.638
- So sorry. Does he make your mom happy?
- Well, yeah, I suppose he...

37:45.182 --> 37:47.059
It doesn't make itself.

37:48.852 --> 37:53.190
This doesn't make itself.
Jesus, that's it. You are brilliant!

37:54.149 --> 37:56.318
- What? What?
- Fucking brilliant!

37:57.236 --> 37:59.238
You aren't seriously going
to work right now.

37:59.696 --> 38:01.448
Yeah, want to come?

38:02.491 --> 38:05.619
- Not at 3 a.m.
- Okay.

38:07.704 --> 38:08.789
Thanks for the chat.

38:13.585 --> 38:14.586
Excuse me.

38:15.462 --> 38:18.715
- Do you work here?
- I do. Hi, I'm Bob Melnikov.

38:19.424 --> 38:21.426
- Hey, are you in charge?
- Of the lab? No.

38:21.927 --> 38:24.096
I'm a biochemist. David Sandstrom
is the chief scientist.

38:24.471 --> 38:26.473
- I thought Caroline Morrison was.
- Oh no, she's not a scientist,

38:26.765 --> 38:28.517
she's the executive director of the lab.
The liaison to--

38:29.059 --> 38:32.521
The 3 countries involved in NorBAC:
Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, right?

38:33.188 --> 38:34.815
- Are you a reporter?
- Yeah.

38:35.691 --> 38:39.903
So, what's going on up north, Bob?
Are we looking at another SARS outbreak?

38:39.938 --> 38:41.113
- I can't... I don't...
- Come on.

38:41.405 --> 38:42.239
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey!

38:47.494 --> 38:49.580
Did you see the report on
Angus MacDonald?

38:50.247 --> 38:53.125
- The mechanic.
- The garage on highway 17. Yeah.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.836
He died before they could question him.
His wife is sick now,

38:55.878 --> 38:59.173
she doesn't work there. I've got a crew
going through all the receipts.

39:00.924 --> 39:02.885
Someone's on that highway.

39:03.927 --> 39:07.723
If they went to another garage,
they're probably having car trouble.

39:08.390 --> 39:11.643
- Let's check out every garage on 17.
- I'm on it.

39:21.028 --> 39:23.739
Okay, hypothesis #2:
We can't find any genetic information

39:24.198 --> 39:26.700
that will prove the Ebola gene
is in the camel pox genome. Why?

39:27.159 --> 39:30.746
Because we are dealing with a
chemically synthesized gene.

39:33.248 --> 39:36.335
Ebola kills, right?
But it doesn't spread very easily.

39:39.421 --> 39:42.841
Camel pox spreads easily,
but it can be fought with a drug.

39:43.634 --> 39:45.719
So, if you could connect them,

39:46.136 --> 39:50.474
Ebola DNA would get a free ride
on the camel pox.

39:50.974 --> 39:54.019
- But they're incompatible. Why?
- Square pegs, round holes.

39:55.187 --> 39:58.899
Right. So you have to remake
the connections, and I'm telling you

39:59.316 --> 40:02.110
there's somebody out there
who's figured out how to do this.

40:02.569 --> 40:04.571
- Now they fit.
- What do you got?

40:04.988 --> 40:08.534
- A super virus.
- Are you saying this thing is deliberate?

40:08.951 --> 40:10.702
You know, well nothing else
makes any sense.

40:10.869 --> 40:13.038
I mean if creating a killing
machine makes any fucking sense.

40:13.205 --> 40:14.873
And I think I know how they did it too.

40:20.045 --> 40:23.841
Amino acids, building blocks of proteins.
Proteins, building blocks of viruses.

40:24.383 --> 40:28.220
So, if you're looking for the Ebola,
you want to look for its DNA recipe,

40:28.637 --> 40:34.142
but we can't find it. Why? Because
the same amino acid can be coded...

40:35.727 --> 40:38.272
- with different DNA.
- Wait, wait, wait. You lost me.

40:39.982 --> 40:41.441
Okay, think of it this way.

40:50.617 --> 40:54.079
- What does that say?
- Grate aural sects.

40:54.496 --> 40:56.498
- Thank you, David.
- You're welcome.

40:59.668 --> 41:05.465
So whoever made this knew
that we'd be looking for this.

41:06.675 --> 41:09.344
So they wrote it like that.

41:13.140 --> 41:14.183
Okay folks.

41:15.058 --> 41:17.769
Now we know what we're looking for.

42:22.709 --> 42:23.752
Jesus Christ.

42:34.763 --> 42:36.014
Hey kid, come here!

42:40.936 --> 42:43.981
All right, listen. Now you stop harassing me,
you stop harassing my daughter

42:44.439 --> 42:47.067
or I swear to God I'll have you put away.
Do you understand?

42:47.442 --> 42:48.527
Hmm? Have a nice day.

42:48.861 --> 42:50.404
Dr. Sandstrom, would you talk to my father?

42:50.612 --> 42:53.574
- Oh, Jesus.
- I think you know him. Dr. Shelby Sloane.

42:54.408 --> 42:57.870
- Shelby Sloane's your father?
- He's the man who cloned me.

42:58.495 --> 43:01.832
- Then why doesn't he fix you?
- 'Cause he's given up.

43:02.332 --> 43:07.171
- No, it's because you're not a clone!
- I am! Please, just let me prove it to you!

43:07.796 --> 43:10.757
All right, I want you to get me
DNA samples of you and whoever

43:11.216 --> 43:16.054
or whatever you were cloned from. I'll run
them through my mass clonometer.

43:16.263 --> 43:17.890
If the samples match up
I'll call the National Post,

43:18.098 --> 43:19.808
they'll make you clone of the year, okay?

43:20.100 --> 43:22.811
It's been a real out of
this world conversation, Mick.

43:23.228 --> 43:25.480
Do you know why my father stopped
being a scientist?

43:25.814 --> 43:27.566
- Oh God.
- Because of what he did to me.

43:27.900 --> 43:29.401
Let me give this to you
straight, all right?

43:29.526 --> 43:32.196
You say you're dying but there's people
out there right now who really are dying.

43:32.529 --> 43:33.322
So why don't you just get your--

43:40.704 --> 43:43.499
Kid, take it easy. All right?

43:50.714 --> 43:52.174
Get me the samples.

43:55.761 --> 43:56.720
Really?

43:59.640 --> 44:00.307
Really.

44:03.936 --> 44:06.230
But I mean it. You stay away
from my daughter.

44:09.817 --> 44:15.572
Ladies and gentlemen, this,
believe it or not, is an artificial gene.

44:16.949 --> 44:19.535
- Scary.
- Bio terrorism, yeah.

44:19.868 --> 44:22.246
I know, how the hell did you
figure this out so fast?

44:22.538 --> 44:26.041
- David, are you sure?
- Uh-hmm, and it's coming right at us.

44:26.458 --> 44:28.502
Wes, Homeland Security, FBI, CSIS,

44:28.877 --> 44:30.879
and send through the
Investigation Securidad.

44:32.506 --> 44:33.757
This is so fucked.

44:34.424 --> 44:36.844
Scientists, all that knowledge,
twisting it around

44:37.094 --> 44:39.263
- just to kill innocent people.
- I can't believe it.

44:39.638 --> 44:43.475
Gas chambers, germ warfare,
atomic bombs. I can.

44:48.981 --> 44:52.192
David, what about a cure?

44:53.026 --> 44:55.821
With Ebola there's no vaccine,
no cure, just quarantine.

44:56.572 --> 45:00.492
Caroline Morrison at NorBAC.
Please tell him it's urgent.

45:07.332 --> 45:09.334
When it hits the city,
it spreads everywhere.

45:09.501 --> 45:11.545
There'll be no way to stop it.

45:11.962 --> 45:13.839
The dead will be the lucky ones.

45:15.465 --> 45:17.384
Why don't you come and sit
down while we wait for the bus.

45:17.593 --> 45:19.303
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh here, let me help with your luggage.

45:20.345 --> 45:22.347
Oh! Great.
I was just coming to sit.

45:25.058 --> 45:26.643
It sounds like
someone's overtired.

45:27.311 --> 45:28.812
Yeah, and a sore throat.

45:30.105 --> 45:31.523
- Oh, what's her name?
- Miranda.

45:32.774 --> 45:34.151
- Oh, Miranda.
- Yeah.

45:34.735 --> 45:37.654
- That's such a lovely name.
- My truck broke down

45:37.905 --> 45:40.449
so I got a little more luggage
than I can handle.

45:40.949 --> 45:42.117
- Oh well, so do I.
- Oh.

45:45.746 --> 45:47.498
Oh, so where you off to?

45:47.915 --> 45:50.250
Oh, the U.K. so Miranda can
meet her dad.

45:50.834 --> 45:52.461
I came back to Canada
to have her.

45:52.794 --> 45:54.922
And what's his problem?
Wasn't he there at the conception?

45:55.839 --> 45:58.634
- Well, he's a great guy.
- Oh. Oh hey, the bus is here.

45:59.051 --> 46:01.678
- Here, let me help you with this.
- Oh, you don't mind? Oh, thank you.

46:01.720 --> 46:03.597
- No, no, no. What's your name?
- Daisy.

46:04.431 --> 46:06.183
- I'm Frances.
- Hi, Frances. Thanks a lot.

46:09.728 --> 46:12.314
- Here, I'll let you go first.
- Thank you.

47:00.612 --> 47:02.281
Well, Frances, it looks like
we'll almost there.

47:04.658 --> 47:05.659
Frances?

47:08.120 --> 47:08.745
Frances.

47:16.378 --> 47:18.589
Hey! Hey!

47:20.507 --> 47:22.759
You have to be very cautious
when throwing around terms like epidemic.

47:23.302 --> 47:25.095
But it has the potential
to be one?

47:25.429 --> 47:27.681
Anytime you have a virulent,
unidentified agent,

47:27.890 --> 47:30.642
there is of course a potential
for an epidemic, provided--

47:32.186 --> 47:33.979
Just tell the truth,
God damn it.

47:34.605 --> 47:38.275
And say what? That we've got a manmade
virus out there heading right at us?

47:38.775 --> 47:40.360
You do that,
you'll have chaos.

47:40.402 --> 47:44.364
- There's no risk to the general population.
- Just as long as you wash your hands.

47:44.531 --> 47:47.284
We can't stress enough the importance of
thoroughly washing your hands.

47:49.244 --> 47:51.205
They have no idea what's
coming at them.

47:54.208 --> 47:57.419
Yes, but what's the difference between
a medical emergency and an epidemic?

47:57.961 --> 47:59.505
Cynical reporter:1,

47:59.713 --> 48:01.882
earnest health official: 0.

48:02.341 --> 48:03.759
If you need me, I'll be back at the lab.

48:04.968 --> 48:06.345
Second, there is no epidemic.

48:13.727 --> 48:16.563
- I got what you need.
- You don't go away, do you?

48:17.439 --> 48:19.983
Look, I've got it right here.

48:20.859 --> 48:23.362
Kid, what I need you couldn't
fit in that little brown bag.

48:24.154 --> 48:25.656
You know what? I'm beginning to
think you are a clone.

48:26.573 --> 48:27.866
You came from
a fucking mule.

48:28.283 --> 48:30.702
- Look! Look at these!
- Whatever that is, I don't want it.

48:31.286 --> 48:33.330
Baby teeth. One of mine, one
of my brother Cal's.

48:33.539 --> 48:34.623
They still got blood on them.

48:34.998 --> 48:36.124
You said if I got you samples
you'd test them.

48:37.167 --> 48:37.918
You said!

48:38.001 --> 48:42.130
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I know but see,
those could both be your teeth.

48:42.756 --> 48:45.300
I'd need the complete sets. Sorry.

48:46.844 --> 48:50.556
- You promised.
- Don't do that, understand?

48:55.853 --> 48:56.562
Jesus.

48:59.898 --> 49:01.024
Yeah.

49:01.859 --> 49:02.901
Where?

49:05.070 --> 49:06.071
Oh shit.

49:08.282 --> 49:09.700
Did you call Carlos already?

49:10.617 --> 49:12.244
Okay, I'm on my way.

49:15.622 --> 49:18.792
Jesus! Would you get the fuck out of here!

49:19.710 --> 49:22.880
My mother died 2 years before
I was born, Dr. Sandstrom.

49:23.922 --> 49:25.924
Does that make
any sense to you?

49:35.642 --> 49:37.561
Promise you'll look into it.

49:38.562 --> 49:40.939
- Yeah, now get up.
- Promise.

49:43.150 --> 49:44.109
Promise.

49:51.742 --> 49:54.286
Thank you, Dr. Sandstrom.
So, you'll call me then?

49:54.369 --> 49:55.954
Oh yeah, I'll put you on my speed dial.

49:56.497 --> 49:57.831
My number's right there on the bag.

49:58.624 --> 49:59.500
- Goodbye, Mick.
- Goodbye.

50:00.167 --> 50:00.876
Thank you, sir.

50:20.604 --> 50:23.315
Uh, Dr. Sloane...

50:24.942 --> 50:27.361
this is David Sandstrom calling.

50:28.195 --> 50:30.197
Uh, it's about your son...

50:30.489 --> 50:32.032
about some kid who claims
to be your son.

50:32.282 --> 50:35.118
I think we've got a problem here.
Could you call me on my cell?

50:37.621 --> 50:40.457
Yes, but what's the difference between
a medical emergency and an epidemic?

50:41.083 --> 50:44.127
Cynical reporter: 1,
earnest health official: 0.

50:44.962 --> 50:46.046
If you need me, I'll be back at the lab.

50:47.506 --> 50:49.258
Second, there is no epidemic.

50:52.845 --> 50:53.512
- Morrison.
- Caroline?

50:54.137 --> 50:56.181
Another call, on a bus just
outside the city limits.

50:56.598 --> 50:57.641
Oh shit.

50:59.434 --> 51:00.185
We have the bus sealed.

51:00.519 --> 51:02.271
It's heading towards the quarantine
facility near the airport.

51:02.813 --> 51:05.524
Okay, I'm on my way. Call David and
Carlos, tell them to meet me there.

51:05.607 --> 51:06.358
Got it.

51:14.366 --> 51:16.285
Caroline took me to her office, asked
me all kindsof questions

51:16.410 --> 51:18.036
about Hira, her family, her brothers.

51:18.704 --> 51:20.122
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

51:20.497 --> 51:23.417
Well, I did say she wears nice perfume:
Hints of saffron and cinnamon.

51:23.959 --> 51:24.710
At least that's what I detected.

51:25.460 --> 51:29.006
We have another case. It could be
a busload. Quarantined at the airport.

51:29.673 --> 51:32.593
So, it's here. All right,
I'll be back with samples.

51:33.260 --> 51:35.387
Somebody track down Hira,
we're going to need her on this.

51:50.652 --> 51:52.571
What's going on here?
Why are we being kept on this bus?

51:53.030 --> 51:54.573
Sit down, be quiet and
put your mask on.

51:54.907 --> 51:55.449
No one told us anything.

51:55.949 --> 51:57.826
It's nothing to worry about.
You're being put in quarantine.

52:28.941 --> 52:30.234
All right, thank you Mr. Zaltsberg.

52:31.318 --> 52:33.821
Dear, how much longer do
I have to stay here?

52:34.321 --> 52:36.114
The nurse will explain everything.

52:36.865 --> 52:38.116
This is a nurse?

52:56.635 --> 53:01.390
Are you in charge here, 'cause
I've got to be on a plane.

53:01.890 --> 53:03.225
Sit down please. I'll explain everything.

53:08.313 --> 53:10.732
Daisy, my name is Caroline
Morrison, I'm with NorBAC.

53:12.693 --> 53:13.735
Which is what?

53:13.819 --> 53:16.822
The North American Biotechnology
Advisory Commission.

53:17.573 --> 53:19.908
So, what they're saying about
some kind of virus...

53:21.076 --> 53:23.662
- It's what Frances has?
- We think so.

53:24.371 --> 53:27.040
Well, what is it?
I mean... could we get it?

53:27.249 --> 53:29.960
Daisy, listen to me.
We're not sure how it's spreading.

53:31.044 --> 53:32.921
We're not even sure what it is.

53:32.963 --> 53:36.133
Well, I'm fine. I mean, we're both fine.

53:36.758 --> 53:38.093
I have to be in England.

53:38.677 --> 53:41.180
Of course but we need you to
answer a few questions:

53:41.889 --> 53:44.850
Where you travelled from,
people you might have met along the way.

53:45.350 --> 53:46.435
Fine.

53:47.853 --> 53:50.147
Did you happen to stop for gas
near Bear River?

53:52.191 --> 53:53.859
- Yeah.
- Where's your car?

53:54.443 --> 53:57.446
Pick up. It gave up on me
so I traded it in for a ride to the bus.

54:01.325 --> 54:04.578
With Angus.
Angus's garage near Soren?

54:07.039 --> 54:09.625
Uh, I'd take you to Toronto,
but I'm the only one here.

54:10.083 --> 54:13.295
No, don't worry. It's okay, really.
The bus station will be just fine.

54:14.296 --> 54:15.672
I'm sure it'll get us there on time.

54:16.840 --> 54:19.676
Yeah. How did you know?

54:20.219 --> 54:21.970
It's a long ride.
Where are you travelling from?

54:22.346 --> 54:26.808
My parents.
Heron Bay, near Marathon.

54:28.727 --> 54:29.895
Okay.

54:32.648 --> 54:35.818
Okay? Does that mean
I can go now ?

54:37.069 --> 54:38.779
It's going to be a little longer.

55:07.391 --> 55:10.686
Her neighbour was with her yesterday.
Said that she was perfectly fine.

55:10.978 --> 55:12.646
- How's the neighbour?
- No symptoms.

55:12.938 --> 55:15.023
Okay, so probably
not airborne transmission.

55:16.275 --> 55:17.860
It could be a respiratory secretion.

55:18.610 --> 55:22.322
A cough or a sneeze, but it would
have be directed right at the n...

55:24.158 --> 55:24.867
Next victim?

55:29.413 --> 55:32.457
My mom's a midwife,
she was freaking, right.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.918
Like nobody's ever had a baby
in Africa before.

55:36.170 --> 55:37.546
You were in Africa?

55:37.838 --> 55:39.798
Yeah, I worked at an AIDS hospice.

55:40.340 --> 55:43.051
Yeah, I was really sick, like sick-sick,
and William was travelling all the time

55:43.260 --> 55:46.305
so he thought it'd be best
if I came home to have Miranda.

55:46.722 --> 55:48.056
- William?
- My fiancé.

55:48.682 --> 55:53.228
- Where is William now?
- In London. He just rented us an apartment.

55:54.188 --> 55:56.356
Oh, excuse me. A flat. Hah!

55:56.648 --> 55:58.275
- He's British?
- Very.

55:58.901 --> 56:01.278
He holds his little finger
up when he drinks his tea.

56:01.945 --> 56:04.865
- Would you like me to set up a call?
- Yeah. Yeah, call him.

56:05.240 --> 56:10.579
William Zanzinger. His number's
in my wallet. You guys have that.

56:10.621 --> 56:12.831
- Okay.
- I've been trying to call him all day.

56:12.915 --> 56:13.874
Hold on.

56:18.795 --> 56:20.797
Okay, the new woman Frances who
was just brought in,

56:21.423 --> 56:24.676
we can't find an intersection
between her and the other victims,

56:25.385 --> 56:28.555
but the girl she was sitting next to,
the one you're looking at,

56:29.014 --> 56:31.975
had contact with just about
everyone who's gotten sick.

56:40.943 --> 56:42.110
What about the baby?

56:42.152 --> 56:43.862
It says here she has a throat infection.

56:44.238 --> 56:46.907
Temperature, swollen glands,
that's it? Anything else?

56:50.410 --> 56:51.912
I think we should take
a closer look,

56:52.162 --> 56:54.248
take some throat cultures,
see what we come up with.

56:55.165 --> 56:57.668
We've been through her things.
No aerosol spray, no powder

56:58.126 --> 56:59.837
no anything she could have used
to spread the virus.

57:00.379 --> 57:02.589
Well, it wouldn't make much sense for her
to deliberately spread the virus,

57:03.048 --> 57:04.466
unless she was immune to it.

57:04.842 --> 57:07.344
Well, all I know is she was sitting right
next to that woman and look at her.

57:09.471 --> 57:10.931
She could have a
natural immunity.

57:11.765 --> 57:12.975
David, what do think?

57:13.600 --> 57:17.271
Morrison.
Yeah. When did they find them?

57:18.689 --> 57:20.816
Her parents were just found dead.

57:21.400 --> 57:25.487
- Well that ain't natural. Oh.
- David, what?

57:26.655 --> 57:28.031
What if there's nothing natural about it?

57:29.074 --> 57:33.078
I mean, some son of a bitch has figured out
a way to manufacture a Camelpox/Ebola virus.

57:33.579 --> 57:36.206
Who's to say that same son of a bitch
couldn't manufacture an immunity?

57:36.707 --> 57:38.792
Look, DNA samples from the mother and baby
will tell us this.

57:39.168 --> 57:40.002
I'll set it up.

57:41.420 --> 57:44.089
Guys, no mention of her parents.

57:51.221 --> 57:51.847
Sorry, about that.

57:52.681 --> 57:54.141
Yeah, look, are you going to call
my fiancé?

57:54.641 --> 57:58.061
Yes, but before we do that,
those men I was just speaking with,

57:58.687 --> 57:59.730
they're doctors.

58:08.197 --> 58:11.408
Hi, I'm sorry to disturb you
again. Uh, is your dad in?

58:14.453 --> 58:15.412
Oh, he talked to my father.

58:15.871 --> 58:17.414
- Well, it's a good thing, isn't it?
- No.

58:18.832 --> 58:20.876
He told him that I was crazy and
that I was harassing you.

58:21.293 --> 58:22.377
So, are you going to stop?

58:23.212 --> 58:26.173
Maybe. Just look...
do you happen to know where he is?

58:26.673 --> 58:28.300
He's saving the world
again I guess.

58:28.800 --> 58:33.514
I know. I mean... his work on the biochemistry
of SCF dependant ubiquitination and yeast

58:33.931 --> 58:35.682
was crucial on understanding cancer.

58:36.308 --> 58:39.186
- Oh, I've read his articles.
- What articles?

58:39.645 --> 58:41.313
I mean I don't know,
he doesn't tell me anything.

58:41.647 --> 58:44.358
- How come?
- 'Cause who really cares?

58:45.984 --> 58:49.112
Uh, you should.
I mean, he's an amazing scientist.

58:51.240 --> 58:54.743
- Are you okay?
- Did you talk to him about me?

58:55.786 --> 58:57.120
Kind of.

59:00.374 --> 59:01.875
Did you want to come in?

59:13.053 --> 59:15.556
Her throat looks very red,
has it been bothering her?

59:15.722 --> 59:17.140
No.

59:35.367 --> 59:36.660
What did just say to her ?

59:37.161 --> 59:39.163
Not to worry.

59:39.454 --> 59:41.206
Could you tell me?

59:44.918 --> 59:49.882
The virus is contained, still as a precaution,
20 people are quarantined behind me

59:50.465 --> 59:54.178
in this vacant warehouse that
has now been dubbed "HAZMAT City".

59:54.845 --> 59:57.472
However, officials are remaining
tight lipped. Stan.

59:58.223 --> 01:00:01.518
Naomi, there are some reports that
some 50 students from Irving Leighton High

01:00:02.311 --> 01:00:04.688
are spending the night in hospital.

01:00:04.897 --> 01:00:07.566
That's right. The students are
in hospital for observation.

01:00:08.233 --> 01:00:11.320
Yes, Stan, I can report that
I am indeed talking out of my ass.

01:00:12.529 --> 01:00:14.948
And you've got a great ass, Naomi,
I'd ask you to shake it for us

01:00:15.365 --> 01:00:17.367
if I didn't think you were so full of shit.

01:00:18.785 --> 01:00:20.787
Good evening, people.
I've got samples.

01:00:20.996 --> 01:00:25.751
We might have patient zero,
so Bob, DNA work.

01:00:26.543 --> 01:00:29.171
Hira, I want you check the serum
for antibodies to every human virus,

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.966
extract nucleic acid and do a
probe on the viral gene chip.

01:00:33.133 --> 01:00:33.967
- Carlos--
- David.

01:00:34.218 --> 01:00:35.260
...you handle pathology.

01:00:35.469 --> 01:00:37.596
Mayko, we need complete
bioinformatics on all the samples,

01:00:38.096 --> 01:00:39.515
and Wes...

01:00:40.307 --> 01:00:41.225
I could use a coffee.

01:00:41.642 --> 01:00:43.519
Caroline gave me very specific
instructions about Hira.

01:00:44.102 --> 01:00:44.937
I don't care.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:10.754
Daisy

01:01:14.091 --> 01:01:15.634
a paediatrician is here.

01:01:16.134 --> 01:01:19.221
A specialist, to look at Miranda
to make sure she's all right.

01:01:20.889 --> 01:01:22.432
She already had all those tests.

01:01:23.142 --> 01:01:24.977
No. No, she's been through enough.

01:01:25.561 --> 01:01:28.981
I understand that,
but there's another test we have to do.

01:01:30.315 --> 01:01:32.192
- What? Is she going to be okay?
- She'll be fine.

01:01:35.779 --> 01:01:38.031
This will be the last time
you'll have to give her up, I promise.

01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:40.534
- Why does she have to be in that?
- Just for her safety.

01:01:40.826 --> 01:01:41.660
She'll be fine.

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:49.751
Okay, okay. I'm right here.

01:01:50.794 --> 01:01:51.378
I'm right here.

01:01:57.843 --> 01:01:58.969
Still no answer at William's.

01:01:59.344 --> 01:02:03.682
Well, maybe he's out or at a friends
or something. That's my girl.

01:02:04.933 --> 01:02:06.477
What were you doing in Africa?

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.854
I told you, I was
working at an AIDS hospice.

01:02:09.605 --> 01:02:11.940
- Yes, but why Africa?
- Why not?

01:02:13.692 --> 01:02:15.360
How would you describe your politics?

01:02:20.908 --> 01:02:22.493
Uh, environmental anarchist.

01:02:23.368 --> 01:02:26.330
- Save the earth, that sort of thing.
- Yeah, that sort of thing.

01:02:26.747 --> 01:02:28.874
You know, from governments,
from multinationals,

01:02:29.458 --> 01:02:31.460
from governments run by multinationals.

01:02:32.169 --> 01:02:35.172
- Do you belong to a political party?
- You're kidding me, right?

01:02:36.256 --> 01:02:38.800
- How about William?
- No, not that I know of.

01:02:39.468 --> 01:02:41.261
Those are two different answers.

01:02:44.973 --> 01:02:48.727
Do either of you have any religious
affiliations? Christian, Muslim?

01:02:49.311 --> 01:02:51.855
I'm sorry, but what does this
have to do with people being sick?

01:02:53.649 --> 01:02:54.107
Thank you.

01:03:02.282 --> 01:03:06.453
Daisy, I need you to look at something.
Would you step up to the glass please?

01:03:07.246 --> 01:03:09.623
What, you want me to pick
somebody out of a line up now?

01:03:10.833 --> 01:03:15.546
Not exactly.
Do you recognize this man?

01:03:17.714 --> 01:03:22.219
- Why, is he sick too?
- This is from the U.K. passport office.

01:03:23.387 --> 01:03:25.722
This man's passport
was stolen 2 years ago.

01:03:26.515 --> 01:03:28.433
His name is William Zanzinger.

01:03:29.685 --> 01:03:30.727
So, what?

01:03:30.769 --> 01:03:32.980
Are you trying to tell me there's only
one William Zanzinger in the world?

01:03:33.397 --> 01:03:35.524
Only one who lives
in Surrey and he's never been to Africa.

01:03:35.816 --> 01:03:36.859
Oh, well, good for him!

01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:38.819
He's not my William.

01:03:43.574 --> 01:03:45.534
- Does your William have an accent?
- Yes.

01:03:45.826 --> 01:03:47.077
- What kind?
- English.

01:03:47.452 --> 01:03:48.704
- Where was he born?
- In England!

01:03:49.079 --> 01:03:51.123
Did you ever see him use
another passport?

01:03:54.209 --> 01:03:57.963
Daisy, I want to help you get out of here.

01:03:59.131 --> 01:04:01.216
Maybe this is all a big
misunderstanding.

01:04:02.009 --> 01:04:04.303
If so, let's figure it out.

01:04:05.554 --> 01:04:06.471
Together.

01:04:09.183 --> 01:04:10.517
He has another passport, yes.

01:04:12.311 --> 01:04:14.354
To get into countries where he's
had trouble before.

01:04:14.897 --> 01:04:16.732
Like Zimbabwe.
All journalists have them.

01:04:17.065 --> 01:04:17.900
Sure.

01:04:20.277 --> 01:04:22.196
What name is on that passport?

01:04:25.157 --> 01:04:26.325
It's really wild, I don't get it.

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.952
I ran the DNA on the baby's
throat swab and her blood.

01:04:30.787 --> 01:04:32.164
Baby's throat, baby's blood.

01:04:35.459 --> 01:04:37.294
- Run the test again.
- We ran her DNA 3 times.

01:04:38.879 --> 01:04:40.172
The throat and blood doesn't match.

01:04:40.214 --> 01:04:42.549
- It makes no sense.
- That's what I said.

01:04:42.633 --> 01:04:44.968
Okay, a viral infection would
cause some differences in the DNA.

01:04:45.093 --> 01:04:46.845
Not this many.
There's way more than there should be.

01:04:47.262 --> 01:04:49.515
I can see that. Hira!
Look at this.

01:04:53.227 --> 01:04:55.813
Roll over. There, that band
in her blood sample.

01:04:57.397 --> 01:04:59.107
It's the same as DNA
in neg to pos.

01:05:00.609 --> 01:05:01.985
It looks weird.

01:05:02.694 --> 01:05:04.780
There. That's RNA.

01:05:05.531 --> 01:05:08.283
She's right. Something is very
wrong. Very, very wrong.

01:05:09.076 --> 01:05:10.410
RNA?

01:05:11.245 --> 01:05:13.372
What's it doing in the middle
of her DNA?

01:05:16.124 --> 01:05:17.000
What'd they do?

01:05:18.085 --> 01:05:21.880
Maybe if we can find out
what kind of RNA we're looking at...

01:05:21.964 --> 01:05:22.881
You got an idea?

01:05:24.842 --> 01:05:27.386
It's a natural SIRNA.
It should be in her throat.

01:05:27.845 --> 01:05:30.722
- SIRNA.
- But it's gone.

01:05:31.515 --> 01:05:33.559
- SIRNA.
- Where the hell is it?

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.185
Holy shit.

01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:37.479
As SIRNA that kills viruses in plants?

01:05:37.813 --> 01:05:39.314
Yeah, it's in people too, right?

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:42.151
It's probably just some leftover
from billions of years ago

01:05:42.234 --> 01:05:43.402
when animals split from plants.

01:05:43.735 --> 01:05:46.071
Well, what if it's that?
What if it does do something in people?

01:05:46.905 --> 01:05:49.283
- Maybe, no one knows.
- Well, maybe this bastard does know.

01:05:49.324 --> 01:05:50.951
Caroline, I've got something...
I'm on my way.

01:05:52.161 --> 01:05:54.621
Uh, I'm not really that hungry.

01:05:56.832 --> 01:05:59.960
So, this whole like clone thing.

01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:03.589
You can't actually... I mean,
you can't actually clone someone, can you?

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:08.385
Well, yeah. I mean, well...
okay, look.

01:06:08.594 --> 01:06:14.558
Let's just say that this
olive is an egg, a human egg.

01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:17.978
Now first what you do...

01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:21.732
is you remove the nucleus,

01:06:23.066 --> 01:06:24.985
or the core, you know,
the brains of the cell.

01:06:27.654 --> 01:06:32.784
Then you insert the nucleus of the one
that you want to clone

01:06:32.826 --> 01:06:34.578
like this.

01:06:37.998 --> 01:06:41.793
Now, to get it going you have to
give it a little bit of a shock.

01:06:41.835 --> 01:06:44.796
That's just for demonstration
purposes only of course.

01:06:44.838 --> 01:06:48.550
Now the nucleus is reprogramming
the egg and telling it what to be.

01:06:52.387 --> 01:06:57.142
- Okay, and then?
- Right, then...

01:06:57.392 --> 01:07:00.562
uh, well now we wait until it grows
and divides and when it's stable enough,

01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:06.944
we place it into the womb and hope that
the expression of the genetic makeup

01:07:06.985 --> 01:07:09.571
more or less resembles a human being.

01:07:10.072 --> 01:07:13.534
- The expression?
- Yeah.. You know like the way we look.

01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:19.998
- Yeah, well I think you look pretty good.
- You don't...

01:07:21.542 --> 01:07:25.796
You don't think I'm a freak
because I wasn't born the normal way?

01:07:26.129 --> 01:07:31.134
- Oh, and what's the normal way?
- You know, like a mom and a dad,

01:07:31.176 --> 01:07:35.889
- 2 people in love...
- Man, you've got to get out of the 'burbs.

01:07:38.225 --> 01:07:39.268
I'm joking!

01:07:40.394 --> 01:07:41.770
Geesh, it's a joke.

01:07:42.938 --> 01:07:43.605
Thanks.

01:07:59.746 --> 01:08:01.290
- Halt! Hey!
- I'm with NorBAC.

01:08:03.292 --> 01:08:04.126
All right.

01:08:06.253 --> 01:08:09.173
Okay, not so fast. My brain can only absorb
so many acronyms.

01:08:10.132 --> 01:08:11.884
What is SIRNA?

01:08:12.509 --> 01:08:16.138
It's a weapon that plants use
to protect themselves from viruses.

01:08:16.805 --> 01:08:19.224
We have it too except nobody
really knows what it does in people.

01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:24.020
- But we can make a logical assumption.
- That it fights infections in people too?

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:29.401
Right. So, SIRNA is like
this secret, quiet imperial guard

01:08:29.734 --> 01:08:31.361
and it's all throughout the palace.

01:08:31.487 --> 01:08:32.696
Okay? Head, shoulders, knees, toes.

01:08:33.071 --> 01:08:35.365
Except in Miranda's case,
it's not in her throat.

01:08:35.948 --> 01:08:38.160
Someone figured out how to
eliminate it from your throat?

01:08:38.827 --> 01:08:42.788
Right, right, just her throat.
So, if they did what I think they did,

01:08:43.582 --> 01:08:46.960
throat is the only room in the palace
where there aren't any guards.

01:08:47.002 --> 01:08:49.755
It's the only place
where the virus can live.

01:08:51.006 --> 01:08:53.591
From there, it leaves the palace,

01:08:53.634 --> 01:08:56.303
it spreads through cough,
burp, sneeze or puke,

01:08:56.428 --> 01:09:00.015
and all the peasants who come
in contact with it, they get the virus-

01:09:00.057 --> 01:09:01.015
Okay, okay, okay, stop.

01:09:02.434 --> 01:09:06.604
You're telling me the baby has a virus,
but can't get the disease?

01:09:06.979 --> 01:09:07.856
Exactly.

01:09:11.276 --> 01:09:12.528
So, the baby's patient zero.

01:09:14.738 --> 01:09:16.615
- Nice work.
- Oh well, it was a group effort really.

01:09:16.657 --> 01:09:17.616
Hira nailed it.

01:09:19.368 --> 01:09:21.828
- She was at the lab?
- She works there.

01:09:22.746 --> 01:09:24.288
David...

01:09:28.919 --> 01:09:30.879
I think Daisy knows who did this.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.883
- What? Jesus, you got a name?
- That's what I'm working on.

01:09:35.216 --> 01:09:37.761
Stick around,
I may need your help.

01:09:43.267 --> 01:09:46.060
... confirms that the U.S. has stepped up
health monitoring at all border crossings.

01:09:46.478 --> 01:09:50.649
Meanwhile here in Toronto,
health officials continue to remind people

01:09:50.858 --> 01:09:55.487
that washing your hands is the best way
to prevent exposure to the mystery virus.

01:09:56.530 --> 01:09:57.447
An info line has been set--

01:10:02.077 --> 01:10:04.413
You don't have that disease thing
they talked about, do you?

01:10:06.081 --> 01:10:07.791
That's about the only thing I don't have.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:17.134
- So, what exactly is wrong with you?
- Exactly? Well, my kidneys are going,

01:10:17.926 --> 01:10:21.263
my liver's not great.
Don't even get me started on my spleen.

01:10:22.014 --> 01:10:23.765
That's why your dad's got to help me.

01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:28.145
Wait... So, how did your body
get so screwed up?

01:10:29.396 --> 01:10:31.482
Well, uh, I was made...

01:10:33.775 --> 01:10:37.237
so that I could give part of myself
to my brother.

01:10:39.615 --> 01:10:43.118
- A part of yourself?
- Here, just...

01:10:47.789 --> 01:10:50.042
That's my brother, Cal.

01:10:54.087 --> 01:10:56.632
- He was always sick.
- The same as you, or...?

01:10:57.090 --> 01:10:59.593
No, no, he had
cancer of the bone marrow.

01:11:01.386 --> 01:11:04.264
They tried to find
a match, they couldn't,

01:11:05.265 --> 01:11:08.811
so that's when my dad came up
with the idea to make a clone and...

01:11:11.063 --> 01:11:14.191
give marrow to Cal from the new Cal.

01:11:16.151 --> 01:11:19.029
He used you to save your brother.

01:11:20.572 --> 01:11:22.533
They had to do it a bunch of times

01:11:23.575 --> 01:11:25.035
because eventually the
cancer would just come back.

01:11:28.622 --> 01:11:33.293
The last time was 2 years ago,
but it didn't...

01:11:35.254 --> 01:11:36.880
see, it didn't take at all, so...

01:11:39.049 --> 01:11:40.175
so Cal died.

01:11:45.305 --> 01:11:47.808
I'm sorry. And you?

01:11:51.103 --> 01:11:54.022
That's why your dad has to help me.

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:31.059
Daisy.

01:12:33.437 --> 01:12:34.438
I want Miranda.

01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:37.065
I just saw her, she's fine.
She's sleeping.

01:12:38.192 --> 01:12:40.694
They're going to bring her to you
as soon as she wakes up.

01:12:44.072 --> 01:12:46.575
- Daisy, was this a planned pregnancy?
- What?

01:12:47.326 --> 01:12:49.661
Were you using birth control
when you became pregnant?

01:12:51.121 --> 01:12:52.331
I was on the pill.

01:12:53.165 --> 01:12:55.626
It's not foolproof.
- Apparently not.

01:12:58.545 --> 01:13:02.341
We need to talk about William.
How did you meet?

01:13:03.592 --> 01:13:06.553
- In Cape Town.
- At a bar, a party, where?

01:13:07.179 --> 01:13:09.056
- What difference does it make?
- So why don't you just tell me?

01:13:10.974 --> 01:13:14.353
I was almost raped. There were 3 guys,

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:16.313
William came out of nowhere
and ran them off.

01:13:16.814 --> 01:13:20.567
One man against 3 coming out of nowhere
at just the right moment,

01:13:21.068 --> 01:13:22.361
sweeping you off your feet.

01:13:24.238 --> 01:13:26.657
- That's what happened.
- I bet William is really good looking too

01:13:29.117 --> 01:13:31.119
and he never hurt your feelings.

01:13:32.204 --> 01:13:35.123
You told all your girlfriends
he was the perfect guy, right?

01:13:37.084 --> 01:13:39.336
I bet you never even had a fight.

01:13:40.504 --> 01:13:41.672
Did you?

01:13:42.881 --> 01:13:44.007
Ever?

01:13:45.342 --> 01:13:46.802
Now is that real?

01:13:49.012 --> 01:13:49.930
What are you talking about?

01:13:51.056 --> 01:13:53.976
We're in love with each other.
We're getting married on Sunday.

01:13:54.351 --> 01:13:57.604
The address you gave,
there's no such address in London.

01:14:00.774 --> 01:14:01.525
That's not true.

01:14:01.775 --> 01:14:04.820
William's cell phone is registered to
a Nicholas Sargosa. Do you know who he is?

01:14:05.571 --> 01:14:08.657
Nicholas Sargosa has hundreds
of cell phones and he keeps losing them.

01:14:09.158 --> 01:14:12.035
He's a front for people who want
untraceable cell phones.

01:14:14.371 --> 01:14:15.998
- What?
- You said William was a writer.

01:14:16.206 --> 01:14:19.626
We haven't found one thing he's written.
Who does he write for?

01:14:20.085 --> 01:14:23.547
Progressive magazines.
And he's writing a book.

01:14:23.672 --> 01:14:25.048
- Who's his publisher?
- I don't know!

01:14:26.967 --> 01:14:29.470
- But he got a big advance.
- Of course. He's got money.

01:14:31.138 --> 01:14:33.474
Maybe he writes under a pseudonym.
Would you happen to know what that was?

01:14:33.557 --> 01:14:33.974
No!

01:14:48.989 --> 01:14:49.823
How is it going?

01:14:55.579 --> 01:14:57.414
Ever use that thing?

01:14:59.416 --> 01:15:01.376
Bet you got some pretty big
bullets in there, eh?

01:15:03.587 --> 01:15:04.463
Caroline's ready for you.

01:15:05.547 --> 01:15:07.341
OK. Showtime! How do I look?

01:15:10.052 --> 01:15:12.554
Yeah... Nice.
Thanks for the chat.

01:15:14.598 --> 01:15:16.141
I don't know, Wes,
what do you think?

01:15:16.475 --> 01:15:18.143
- I beg your pardon?
- The uniform, icy stare...

01:15:20.145 --> 01:15:21.313
Does he do anything for you?

01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:31.573
Hi, Daisy. I'm, uh...
one of the doctors.

01:15:32.407 --> 01:15:33.867
- I know who you are.
- Okay sure. Uh...

01:15:36.495 --> 01:15:40.249
I need to know if you've had any
surgery since you got pregnant.

01:15:42.668 --> 01:15:43.752
Any medical procedures?

01:15:45.128 --> 01:15:46.338
Amniocentesis.

01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:51.927
Uh... why? Women your age
don't usually get amnio.

01:15:52.469 --> 01:15:54.388
Because the baby was conceived in Africa
and with all the diseases,

01:15:55.013 --> 01:15:57.474
- William wanted to be sure...
- Okay, okay.

01:15:59.226 --> 01:16:00.978
Uh, how was it done... your amnio?

01:16:02.104 --> 01:16:04.439
- I don't know, I was unconscious.
- For an amnio?

01:16:07.025 --> 01:16:08.235
Okay, Daisy, here's the story. Uh...

01:16:10.195 --> 01:16:11.572
Someone has created a virus

01:16:12.656 --> 01:16:15.033
by combining 2 really horrible viruses,

01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:19.246
Ebola and Camelpox and this new
virus is deadly...

01:16:19.997 --> 01:16:21.540
and your baby has it.

01:16:23.834 --> 01:16:26.879
- Mir... Miranda's dying?
- Oh! No, no. She's okay.

01:16:30.632 --> 01:16:31.925
But here's where it gets kind of crazy:

01:16:32.259 --> 01:16:36.221
She's going to be okay because she's been
genetically modified to be immune to it.

01:16:37.431 --> 01:16:38.724
That's insane!

01:16:39.433 --> 01:16:41.602
That's what they did to her
during your so-called amnio.

01:16:42.519 --> 01:16:46.106
No, because I've been with her
since she was born and I'm fine!

01:16:46.899 --> 01:16:49.318
But you were exposed when
Miranda was in your uterus

01:16:49.735 --> 01:16:51.862
and you developed immunity too.
You can't get it.

01:16:52.196 --> 01:16:54.156
You can't get it, you can't spread it,
only Miranda can.

01:16:54.531 --> 01:16:56.658
- She's what we call a carrier.
- No! Stop saying that!

01:16:57.117 --> 01:17:00.704
Daisy, what's inside Miranda
kills faster than any known disease.

01:17:01.455 --> 01:17:03.373
- William put it there.
- No, that's bullshit!

01:17:03.749 --> 01:17:05.459
That's why he had you flying
from Toronto to La Guardia...

01:17:06.168 --> 01:17:08.962
Taking the shuttle bus to Kennedy,
then flying to Heathrow.

01:17:09.546 --> 01:17:12.132
To spread it as far and as
quickly as he could.

01:17:12.341 --> 01:17:13.592
No! You know, he bought it
that way because he was...

01:17:13.884 --> 01:17:16.470
he was cashing in his points.

01:17:17.262 --> 01:17:19.223
You know.
What's wrong with you people?

01:17:19.723 --> 01:17:21.183
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:17:21.433 --> 01:17:22.434
- The ticket was paid in cash.
- No!

01:17:22.851 --> 01:17:23.852
Look. Look!

01:17:27.856 --> 01:17:30.192
He didn't love you, Daisy.
He set you up.

01:17:30.943 --> 01:17:33.153
He stopped those men from raping you
and then he did it himself.

01:17:33.904 --> 01:17:36.740
No! I want to go to the airport!
I want to go now! I want to go!

01:17:37.157 --> 01:17:40.994
He turned your daughter into
a killing machine. That's what William did.

01:17:42.037 --> 01:17:45.332
Now we need to find him and stop him
before he does this again.

01:17:45.707 --> 01:17:48.126
I want my baby. I want my baby.

01:17:52.297 --> 01:17:55.384
Look at this woman!
Do you remember meeting her?

01:17:55.843 --> 01:17:58.387
Her name's Darlene Evans.
She was your waitress.

01:17:58.804 --> 01:17:59.763
She's dead.

01:18:00.889 --> 01:18:04.476
You won't recognize this guy.
Darlene's husband. Paul.

01:18:05.144 --> 01:18:06.520
He's dead.

01:18:06.979 --> 01:18:08.147
It's spreading. Exponentially.

01:18:08.438 --> 01:18:10.983
- What do you want from me, okay?
- Tell me William's other name.

01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:16.155
This is the man from the garage
who drove you to the bus, Angus.

01:18:16.613 --> 01:18:18.407
He never even made it
to the hospital.

01:18:19.324 --> 01:18:21.493
I need William's name
on his other passport.

01:18:22.202 --> 01:18:25.205
His name, Daisy!
Do you remember Frances?

01:18:27.124 --> 01:18:28.417
- She died an hour ago.
- You're lying!

01:18:28.876 --> 01:18:30.627
Her corpse is in this facility,
do you want to see it?

01:18:31.003 --> 01:18:31.879
No !

01:18:32.212 --> 01:18:33.839
- Two people crossed all their paths.
- No !

01:18:34.214 --> 01:18:37.843
- You and Miranda.
- No! It could have been somebody else!

01:18:38.135 --> 01:18:41.263
- It could have been anybody else! No!
- Did anybody meet your parents?

01:18:43.599 --> 01:18:45.309
They're dead, Daisy.

01:18:45.642 --> 01:18:46.393
No... No!

01:18:56.487 --> 01:18:59.281
- I want my baby!
- We'll bring her to you.

01:19:00.908 --> 01:19:05.996
Just give us his name
and then you can have your baby.

01:19:07.873 --> 01:19:09.166
His name, Daisy!

01:19:16.507 --> 01:19:20.135
Martin Jamison, i-s-o-n,
156 Shaftsbury Lane,

01:19:20.594 --> 01:19:25.182
flat #3, Farnham, England.
It's in Surrey.

01:19:25.933 --> 01:19:28.310
FBI, CSIS, and MI-5...

01:19:29.353 --> 01:19:30.771
Thank you.

01:19:38.153 --> 01:19:39.279
Jesus!

01:19:39.822 --> 01:19:41.031
Are you all right?

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.492
- Where did you learn how to do that?
- Do what?

01:19:43.826 --> 01:19:45.327
Take people apart like that.

01:19:45.661 --> 01:19:47.329
- If I said CIA, would you believe me?
- No.

01:19:48.121 --> 01:19:49.206
CIA.

01:19:50.499 --> 01:19:53.460
You hungry?
It's an agency thing, David.

01:19:53.919 --> 01:19:56.839
I always buy my partners dinner
after we do a good job.

01:19:57.005 --> 01:19:57.798
I could use a beer.

01:20:00.717 --> 01:20:02.094
Is there anything set up for
Daisy and the baby?

01:20:02.427 --> 01:20:03.846
We'll probably get
into that tomorrow.

01:20:04.346 --> 01:20:05.389
How do you tell a mother that

01:20:05.597 --> 01:20:07.599
her baby is going to live in quarantine
for the rest of her life,

01:20:08.392 --> 01:20:10.686
poked and prodded by every scientist
with half an interest in this thing?

01:20:11.228 --> 01:20:13.897
If it was me,
I'd tell her the baby died.

01:20:17.359 --> 01:20:18.694
You wouldn't want to give her
some kind of hope?

01:20:19.319 --> 01:20:20.779
Is there any?

01:20:22.406 --> 01:20:23.824
I don't know. Probably not.

01:20:24.074 --> 01:20:26.535
Daisy needs to pick up the pieces
and start over again.

01:20:29.663 --> 01:20:30.998
You know what? I'm just going to go home.

01:20:31.373 --> 01:20:32.583
David, you don't have to be involved.

01:20:34.251 --> 01:20:36.378
Ah! I don't have to be involved?
That's a fucking relief.

01:20:36.670 --> 01:20:37.713
So I can just take off the rubber gloves,

01:20:38.046 --> 01:20:39.173
throw them in the garbage and walk away?

01:20:40.007 --> 01:20:41.341
You did good work.
We're done here.

01:20:42.676 --> 01:20:44.094
That makes me feel so much better.

01:20:45.345 --> 01:20:48.056
There's a woman in there who
will never see her baby again

01:20:48.432 --> 01:20:49.725
because I did good work.

01:20:52.519 --> 01:20:53.270
Jesus, Caroline!

01:21:58.961 --> 01:21:59.795
Lilith?

01:22:02.923 --> 01:22:03.841
It's to the point.

01:22:17.688 --> 01:22:18.814
Gone out. Be back.
- L

01:22:22.985 --> 01:22:24.653
Did you ever see him use
another passport?

01:22:26.029 --> 01:22:27.156
What name is on that passport?

01:22:27.489 --> 01:22:28.615
I want my baby...

01:22:28.949 --> 01:22:30.200
Tell me William's other name.
His name!

01:22:30.868 --> 01:22:32.202
I want my baby!

01:22:39.084 --> 01:22:39.877
Morrison.

01:22:46.091 --> 01:22:47.593
I heard you.

01:22:53.891 --> 01:22:55.893
I think you're making a mistake.

01:22:58.729 --> 01:23:00.105
Hey, we're in this together, right?

01:23:00.939 --> 01:23:02.941
Okay, this is where he keeps
all his important stuff.

01:23:04.902 --> 01:23:06.236
I looked all over for a key.

01:23:15.704 --> 01:23:17.164
You think you can open it with...?

01:23:18.373 --> 01:23:19.416
Go for it.

01:23:22.544 --> 01:23:23.795
Did you hear that?

01:23:26.006 --> 01:23:26.590
No.

01:23:31.595 --> 01:23:33.889
Okay. Here's my birth certificate.
Look at it, what does it say?

01:23:34.598 --> 01:23:36.809
Uh... February 16th, 1990.

01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:42.898
- Here's my mum's death certificate.
- This can't be right!

01:23:48.028 --> 01:23:48.987
Mick?

01:23:51.073 --> 01:23:53.909
Mick? What's going on?
I didn't hear you come in.

01:23:56.119 --> 01:23:57.079
Who's your friend?

01:23:58.205 --> 01:24:02.543
- I'm Lilith Sandstrom.
- I've spoken with your father.

01:24:03.001 --> 01:24:07.673
- Yeah, Mick was telling me about Cal.
- Now, let me guess. Not the clone story?

01:24:07.965 --> 01:24:09.383
Yeah, I don't think it was a story.

01:24:10.008 --> 01:24:12.553
Well, you might want to ask
your father how likely it is.

01:24:13.178 --> 01:24:14.346
You should go, Lilith.

01:24:15.889 --> 01:24:18.350
- What?
- Mick isn't well.

01:24:18.892 --> 01:24:21.687
- Yeah! I know!
- No, I don't just mean physically.

01:24:22.521 --> 01:24:24.314
I told your father and you might
as well hear it too.

01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:27.943
Mick makes things up.

01:24:28.318 --> 01:24:30.112
- I do not.
- Stories about his brother.

01:24:30.571 --> 01:24:33.824
- It helps him cope with the loss.
- Oh yeah?

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.535
- Well, how do explain--
- Lilith.

01:24:37.786 --> 01:24:41.498
- Mick? What? Why?
- What's going on, Mick?

01:24:42.416 --> 01:24:47.045
- Nothing. Just go.
- Mick?

01:25:06.106 --> 01:25:07.858
- Hey, you okay?
- No!

01:25:09.276 --> 01:25:12.738
- Oh oh... What time is it?
- I don't know.

01:25:14.490 --> 01:25:16.492
- Where were you?
- I was with Mick.

01:25:17.284 --> 01:25:21.205
- The guy's a freak, Lilith. I told you...
- Yes, dad, I know.

01:25:24.208 --> 01:25:26.126
Shit, what did he do?

01:25:29.171 --> 01:25:30.547
Would you just look at this?

01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:37.095
- Death certificate. Nice.
- With Mick's mum. And...

01:25:37.638 --> 01:25:39.640
this is his birth certificate.

01:25:43.185 --> 01:25:44.686
Well, he's human.

01:25:45.854 --> 01:25:48.398
Dad, can you please
just look at the dates?

01:25:48.857 --> 01:25:53.654
Let me guess! His mother died 2 years
before he was born. Hmm?

01:25:54.905 --> 01:25:58.408
He told me Lilith.
It's a neat trick, but come on!

01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:04.081
- Okay, well, then explain it!
- My grandfather had a birth certificate

01:26:04.623 --> 01:26:05.916
that said he was born in Sweden

01:26:06.333 --> 01:26:08.502
and he had another birth certificate
that said he was born in Canada.

01:26:08.836 --> 01:26:10.504
Well, I guess he was born again, then.

01:26:14.341 --> 01:26:17.302
Look... Mick's fucked up.

01:26:18.387 --> 01:26:20.597
All he wants is the truth.

01:26:20.681 --> 01:26:22.182
Why can't you just
have a look at him?

01:26:26.979 --> 01:26:29.648
- Truth, huh?
- Why can't you just tell him...

01:26:30.357 --> 01:26:32.484
whether you can help him...
or not?

01:26:35.487 --> 01:26:38.866
- Somebody should tell him the truth.
- But will you?

01:26:47.499 --> 01:26:49.251
Caroline's had Hira
in there all morning.

01:26:49.543 --> 01:26:51.003
- But where's David?
- Good question.

01:26:51.795 --> 01:26:53.547
- Where's David? I need to show him this.
- What?

01:26:54.339 --> 01:26:56.758
I ran the DNA comparisons
he asked me to on those 2 kids.

01:26:58.051 --> 01:26:59.428
He needs to look at them. It's very odd.

01:26:59.887 --> 01:27:02.681
- These are from 2 different people?
- Their DNA is identical.

01:27:03.474 --> 01:27:05.350
- Twins.
- No, they are brothers. Two years apart.

01:27:05.851 --> 01:27:09.104
- With identical DNA? Bob.
- I didn't make a mistake.

01:27:09.605 --> 01:27:11.023
Then I guess they're clones.

01:27:12.524 --> 01:27:13.859
Ha... Maybe I'll get better samples.

01:27:14.318 --> 01:27:17.779
- Yeah, do that my friend.
- Mayko? Could I see you for a minute?

01:27:20.616 --> 01:27:22.075
Don't pull them all the way out, okay?

01:27:57.319 --> 01:27:58.278
Hey, Daisy.

01:28:00.447 --> 01:28:02.282
When do we get out of here?

01:28:07.246 --> 01:28:08.705
Daisy, Miranda can't leave.

01:28:10.582 --> 01:28:11.416
Do you understand?

01:28:14.169 --> 01:28:15.796
What's going to happen to her?

01:28:19.967 --> 01:28:22.302
What are they going to do to her?
I want the truth!

01:28:26.056 --> 01:28:27.683
She'll be moved to a lab.

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:30.435
She'll have to live in quarantine.

01:28:33.272 --> 01:28:34.731
For how long?

01:28:40.946 --> 01:28:42.281
For the rest of her life.

01:28:49.121 --> 01:28:50.497
Sorry, there's no other alternative.

01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:54.626
There's no hope?

01:29:08.056 --> 01:29:09.183
You're so beautiful.

01:29:13.896 --> 01:29:15.063
So tiny.

01:29:18.192 --> 01:29:19.735
Daisy, I am so sorry.

01:29:22.696 --> 01:29:24.239
I'm so sorry.

01:29:34.958 --> 01:29:35.834
Daisy?

01:29:40.255 --> 01:29:41.215
Daisy?

01:29:54.269 --> 01:29:55.062
Oh shit!

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.028
- She's killing her kid!
- You can't go in there!

01:30:05.322 --> 01:30:06.698
Let go! Let go!

01:30:34.893 --> 01:30:37.312
