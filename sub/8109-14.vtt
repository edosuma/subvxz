00:44.586 --> 00:46.622
Are you ever
coming to bed?

00:49.132 --> 00:50.463
I still say
I'm a vegetarian.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.542
You can say that
you're an astronaut,

00:52.636 --> 00:54.126
but that doesn't
make it true.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.257
A salmon is not
a vegetable, Frankie.

00:56.348 --> 00:58.555
Well, apparently eight
out of 10 commenters
agree with you,

00:58.642 --> 01:00.098
except for the part
where you said,

01:00.185 --> 01:02.267
"I believe what
I want to believe."

01:02.354 --> 01:03.594
That, they found
a little judgmental.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.975
You blogged
our argument?

01:06.066 --> 01:08.557
| asked you to quit
talking about me.

01:08.652 --> 01:10.938
I don't want
a bunch of people
that I don't know

01:11.029 --> 01:12.985
hearing stuff
that's meant to be
between me and you.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.359
I write
about my life,

01:15.450 --> 01:16.735
and you're
a big part of that.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.783
That's great.
I want to be a big
part of your life,

01:18.870 --> 01:20.906
but I don't want to be

Come on, man,
it's 2:00 in the morning,

01:35.345 --> 01:36.551
these walls are made
of tissue paper.

01:36.638 --> 01:39.050
I gotta be up in three
hours to do a wiring
job out in Edison.

01:39.141 --> 01:40.381
Sorry, we'll try

No, no,
that's not what you think.
Something's wrong.

WILSON: What are you
doing tonight?

02:45.582 --> 02:47.038
Masturbating.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.241
l'd invite you,
but people are
already talking.

02:49.336 --> 02:53.079
lt's pathetic. You divide
your nights between porn
and the Discovery Channel.

02:53.173 --> 02:56.506
Right, playing Dance
Dance Revolution is
a much better choice.

02:56.593 --> 03:01.337
Okay, that was a gift from
a patient, and it happens
to be great exercise.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.173
I mean, who rents
porn anymore?

03:04.267 --> 03:05.973
Can't you get that
stuff on the Internet?

03:06.061 --> 03:09.804
You can, but you can't
get disk two with the
director's commentary.

03:10.482 --> 03:12.939
Come out with me tonight.
I'm going speed dating.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.062
If you mean
you're dating on meth,
count me in.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.142
You need to
meet somebody.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.353
This way, you meet
20 somebodies.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.438
Over a five-minute
discussion of Proust?

03:19.533 --> 03:20.818
Speed dating's
a meat market.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.491
Yeah, dozens of women,
just waiting to be hit on.

03:23.578 --> 03:27.412

Twenty-eight-year-old
female, sudden unexplained

03:43.974 --> 03:45.635

03:49.062 --> 03:51.599
Some photographic
processes produce
toxic gases.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.272
FOREMAN: She's a blogger.
I can't see her photos being
anything but digital.

03:54.359 --> 03:58.272
What does she blog?
Politics? Dominatrix?
Cooking? I need recipes.

03:58.363 --> 04:01.025
It's a personal journal.
I don't get putting
your whole life online.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.945
It's not that crazy.
Privacy's basically
a modern invention.

04:04.035 --> 04:07.493
Towns used to be too
small for anybody
to keep any secrets.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.618
What if it's not the
platelets, but the glue that
holds them together?

04:10.709 --> 04:13.200
No, thrombin and
von Willebrand factor
are normal.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.746
And knowing too much
about each other

04:14.838 --> 04:17.705
is exactly why people
leave small towns
and move to the city.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.251
TAUB: And a lot of people
choose to stay

04:19.342 --> 04:23.005

zero privacy, you get

04:29.770 --> 04:31.010
THIRTEEN: Her photos
may be digital,

04:31.104 --> 04:33.481
doesn't mean she couldn't
have been exposed
to some other toxin.

04:33.565 --> 04:34.896
We should search
the apartment.

Thirteen and Tiny.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.359

the pro-community position.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.030

04:51.124 --> 04:53.285
You also like secrets.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.629
You deny it,
that sort of proves
my point.

04:57.214 --> 05:01.002

to our own devices,
we make lousy choices.

STUART: I can hear you
in there. Open the door
or I'm calling the cops.

05:10.101 --> 05:12.513
We're four stories up,
but there's a fire escape
on the other wall.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.265
The ledge might
be wide enough...

05:16.983 --> 05:18.974
We're doctors.
We aren't stealing
anything.

05:19.069 --> 05:21.435
We are collecting
samples.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.563
Who are you?
The neighbor.

05:24.741 --> 05:25.776
Did they say that you
could come in here?

05:25.909 --> 05:27.820
Yep. What do you know
about Frankie and Taylor?

05:27.911 --> 05:30.744
Not much.
The guy works a lot,
but I see Frankie around.

05:30.831 --> 05:34.039
We argue a few times
a week, and then we go
back about our business.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.160
What do you argue about?

05:35.252 --> 05:36.537
Frankie's got some
strong opinions.

05:36.628 --> 05:39.370
Wants to recycle
every molecule of trash.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.455
You take
the anti-recycling
position?

05:41.591 --> 05:45.004
Trash piling up for
composting is attracting every
rat in the neighborhood.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.801
I had to put down poison.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.511
That's her private drawer,
what are you doing over there?

05:48.598 --> 05:51.089
She says she doesn't
have any secrets,
I'm taking her at her word.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.221
Is there any chance
Frankie touched
the rat poison?

05:54.312 --> 05:55.688
Touched it?
She grabbed a chunk of it

05:55.772 --> 05:58.309
right out of the mouth
of the schnauzer
from down the hall.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.433
Now every time
I put the stuff down,
she picks it back up.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.969
Wilson seemed to think
it was a good idea.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.557
You need to dive
back into the pool.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.097
And he has
to swim in ours?

06:33.184 --> 06:35.675
You go to a bar,
you bring your
ugly friends.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.677

good-looking.

06:44.696 --> 06:45.811
Yeah, you are.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.356
You kind of are.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.357
So you attribute
every relationship

06:51.453 --> 06:53.535
I've ever had
to the height
of my cheekbones?

06:53.663 --> 06:55.278
Not the whole relationship,
just the beginning.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.204
The rest is your hair.
CHASE: This is ridiculous.

06:57.334 --> 07:00.201
Women aren't
as distracted by
appearances as we are.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.668
They look deeper.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.500
You wanna bet?

07:05.508 --> 07:07.885
You can't tell anyone
you're a doctor.
You're unemployed.

07:08.011 --> 07:10.878
You're also a little slow.
Misunderstand
everything they say.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.675
And lose the accent.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.974

Do you want
to talk about it?

I'm a diagnostician.

Don't all doctors do that?

Yeah, but they can't

by your hips.

folded the paper

Personally,
I don't think you're
condescending at all.

That's not what I wrote.
When you were

I told you I went

11:50.501 --> 11:52.207
Normal creatinine levels.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.206
She has elevated
cholesterol.

11:54.297 --> 11:56.959
Hey, Wilson!
I can't find my pornos.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.636
Have you tried
offering a reward?

12:00.762 --> 12:03.879
Gaucher's Disease.
It would affect her ability
to synthesize Vitamin K.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.554
She's on a semi-
vegetarian diet.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.132
Means she gets
plenty of Vitamin K.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.054
Sjogrens is more likely.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.056
I assume you moved them
while you were dusting.

12:11.147 --> 12:14.389
I checked the drawers,
window sill, the DVD
player in your room.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.941
The quiet ones
are always deeply
repressed.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.064
I returned them
to the store.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.895
FOREMAN:
She had a fish dinner
a couple of nights ago.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.072
Could be Haff Disease
causing rhabdo.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.650
What? Why did you return
them to the store?

12:25.745 --> 12:28.487
It's no trouble,
I had to stop next door
for my dry cleaning anyway.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.072
Sjogrens would inhibit
the clotting enzymes,
infiltrate the kidneys,

12:31.167 --> 12:32.668
explains everything.
So does Haff Disease.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.413
I'm not thanking you,
I'm asking you why.

12:34.504 --> 12:37.837
Because if I did happen
to bring a woman
home last night,

12:37.966 --> 12:41.584
I wanted it to be
a porn-free zone.

12:44.639 --> 12:48.507
You do realize things
don't have to be socks
to go into a sock drawer.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.183
I'm sorry.
Horribly, horribly sorry.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.183
I thought you'd
watched them all.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.771
You completely
ruined my morning.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.897
I had to pull out your
old family photos.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.988
Your mom was pretty hot.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.778
Haff Disease fits
the timing best.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.204
Start her on saline
and Mannitol.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.629
(DOOR OPENING)

13:20.800 --> 13:22.131
(SIGHING)

13:22.218 --> 13:23.583
You reading your
patient's blog?

13:23.678 --> 13:24.793
No.

13:25.513 --> 13:28.255
You should.
Could be some clues.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.637
Too many.
It'd be like doing
a whole body scan,

13:31.728 --> 13:33.969
send us up eight
blind alleys.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.269
That's why
Chase is doing it.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.019
She mentions you.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.225
She's never met me.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.946
You're an unseen presence,
like the Wizard of Oz.

13:45.074 --> 13:48.407
He was a fraud.
She couldn't have
gone with Keyser SGze?

13:48.536 --> 13:50.822
Speaking of movies
that don't make any sense,

13:50.913 --> 13:53.905
I stopped at the
rental store to get
those pornos back.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.499
I told the guy at the
counter I was so grateful
that you'd returned them,

13:56.586 --> 14:00.249
but I wanted them,
and guess what?
You only returned two.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.626
You lost the third.

14:03.718 --> 14:06.926
Decent of you to pay
for it, not let them
put it on my bill.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.261
You know...

14:09.432 --> 14:11.013
I can explain
what happened.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.180
I'm sure you could,

14:12.268 --> 14:14.725
but rather than
listen to your lies,
I thought it'd be more fun

14:14.812 --> 14:17.428
to drive all over town
and get another copy.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.894
You have it here?

(MUSIC PLAYING ON COMPUTER)

14:33.581 --> 14:36.948
WILSON:
Oh, God. Oh, God.

14:37.251 --> 14:40.414
Okay, first,
that's not me.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.120
It's not... Mostly not...

14:42.799 --> 14:48.135
I was in college! I don't...
My roommate was
minoring in film.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.211
Are you
hyperventilating?

14:50.306 --> 14:53.048
Remember that
covering your mouth
and one nostril can help.

14:53.142 --> 14:56.555
He had to get this in
for some grade, and
he was desperate.

14:56.646 --> 14:59.809
And the only reason I did it
was because no one
would ever see it.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.148
Who knew he'd become
an actual director?

15:02.235 --> 15:05.022
He's not a director,
he's an artist.

15:05.488 --> 15:10.278
The way he plays
with light and darkness
and boobs.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.108
WILSON: Look,
that's not me.

15:12.203 --> 15:14.990
What are you?
Where are you taking me?

15:15.123 --> 15:16.704
Be not afraid.

15:16.791 --> 15:19.498
The forest nymphs
have taught me how
to please a woman.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.832
That's not me! It's not me.
You can see it's not me!

15:26.717 --> 15:30.676
He added extra scenes
so he could release it
as a porno.

15:30.805 --> 15:34.172
Be not afraid, Wilson.
You took risks
for your art.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.682
Oh, boy.

(WOMAN MOANING ON COMPUTER)

15:40.314 --> 15:45.479
No one... Hey, look at me.
No one can know about this.

15:46.487 --> 15:49.354
From this moment on,
my lips are sealed.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.494
Sorry.
It's okay.

15:57.582 --> 15:58.742
Be not afraid.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.874
Find anything?

16:06.549 --> 16:10.633
Relevant? No.
Interesting? I guess.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.837
There's nothing
she doesn't share.
"Angry sex is overrated.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.547
"How can he expect me
to be aroused when
I'm so pissed at him?"

16:16.684 --> 16:18.925
Revelations like that
mightjust earn her
a new kidney.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.143
An hour after she blogged
about her kidney failure,

16:21.230 --> 16:23.607
the hospital got
a call from Singapore.

16:23.733 --> 16:27.100
One of Frankie's readers
asking how hard
it would be to donate.

16:30.281 --> 16:32.397
How good-looking am I?

16:35.286 --> 16:36.867
I'm not asking
if you're attracted to me,

16:36.954 --> 16:38.819
I'm looking for
an objective answer.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.031
Oh, okay, then
it's an appropriate
quesﬂon.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.208
Last night I acted
like a complete tosser
to prove to House

16:44.295 --> 16:46.081
that women don't go out
with me for my looks.

16:46.214 --> 16:49.752
Cost me 100 bucks
and my definition of
myself. And women.

16:49.884 --> 16:52.091
So date men,
they're not
shallow at all.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.260
Everything's physical.
Yes,

16:54.388 --> 16:56.549
we are physical beings.
Some more than others.

16:56.641 --> 16:59.007
Please don't define
my entire gender
based on one night.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.934
No. What if
the patient's problem
is a physical reaction,

17:02.021 --> 17:03.522
not an emotional one?

17:03.606 --> 17:06.723
What if her lack of
arousal had nothing
to do with their fight?

17:06.817 --> 17:09.274
Sjogrens would inhibit
her normal secretions.

17:13.783 --> 17:17.241
CHASE: Sorry for keeping you
up. I thought it better not
to wait till morning.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.944
Oh, it's no problem,
I'm a night owl.

17:21.791 --> 17:26.831
So you think I might have
this Sjogrens because
of my lack of discharge?

17:26.963 --> 17:29.625
Yes. It's lucky
you wrote about that.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.624
And a little crazy,
you're thinking,
to share that much.

17:32.760 --> 17:37.174
Not crazy, unusual,
to be so intimate with
people you don't know.

17:37.306 --> 17:40.639
But I do know them.
They read my blog,
I comment on theirs.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.349
Just because you haven't
met someone physically

17:42.478 --> 17:43.809
doesn't mean you
don't know them.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.308
What about you?
Are you in a relationship?

17:47.525 --> 17:48.810
It recently ended.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.141
Oh, sorry.

17:50.278 --> 17:52.815
Lie flat on your back,
all the way.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.399
But you saw each other
every day, right?

17:58.494 --> 18:00.450
How much did you tell her
about what you were thinking?

18:00.538 --> 18:03.029
Or did you just end up
talking about where you
were going to dinner

18:03.165 --> 18:05.952
and who needed
to do the laundry?

18:06.836 --> 18:08.747
Is that what
your relationship
with Taylor is like?

18:08.838 --> 18:09.953
(CHUCKUNG)No

18:11.007 --> 18:12.463
Well, maybe a little.

18:13.384 --> 18:15.170
He's great,
but sometimes

18:15.261 --> 18:18.674
it's easier to open up
to people who aren't
looking at you.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.715
You need to lie flat
for us to get the x-ray.

18:21.851 --> 18:25.389
I'm actually not
comfortable on my back.
Can't we do it this way?

18:25.521 --> 18:26.636
Did you strain a muscle?

18:26.731 --> 18:27.846
No.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.099
What's wrong?

18:37.533 --> 18:39.319
I've booked our patient
in for heart surgery.

18:39.410 --> 18:42.652
I was doing a sialogram
on her, and she didn't
want to lie on her back.

18:42.747 --> 18:45.534
That's a complaint
you hear from people
with heart valve issues.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.741
It fits. Sjogrens
damaged her heart,

18:47.877 --> 18:50.038
causing her clotting problems,
causing her kidneys to fail.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.292
You based all that on
the fact that she didn't
want to lie down?

18:53.382 --> 18:57.967
That, and the cardiac echo
I performed after she
didn't want to lie down.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.762
HOUSE: Her mitral valve
is nearly gone,

19:01.849 --> 19:03.555
which means
she's nearly gone.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.726
God, you're pretty.

19:12.818 --> 19:17.482
So we can replace the mitral
valve with a pig valve
or with a plastic one.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.484
From an actual pig?

19:19.575 --> 19:22.658
It's the better choice
if you want to have
children someday.

19:22.745 --> 19:25.327
The plastic valve
requires you to be
on anticoagulants,

19:25.414 --> 19:26.995
which are known
to cause birth defects.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.916
On the other hand,
the pig valve wears
out quickly,

19:30.002 --> 19:33.165
so you'd need
to have heart surgery
again in 10 years.

19:33.255 --> 19:37.248
I know that you're on the
fence about having kids,
but Taylor really wants them.

19:39.762 --> 19:41.093
It's in the blog.

19:41.222 --> 19:45.591
I'm afraid you two will need
to agree on that decision
earlier than planned.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.065
It's your call.

my laptop?

20:00.449 --> 20:02.314

I want to get some feedback.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.533
You really think that
asking strangers

20:04.620 --> 20:07.953
for some off-the-top-of-
their-head response
is gonna be helpful here?

20:08.082 --> 20:09.993
A lot of your readers
are into animal rights.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.866
They've got you two-thirds
of the way to vegan,

20:15.172 --> 20:17.037
Whatever they say,
I don't have to do it.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.248
It won't work
out that way,

20:18.342 --> 20:21.505
and we're the ones
that are gonna have
to live with this.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.970
Please, Frankie.
Don't tell them.

20:27.309 --> 20:30.801
If I start picking
and choosing,
I'm being dishonest.

20:31.522 --> 20:32.932
I'm sorry.

20:48.664 --> 20:49.949
Thanks.

21:04.972 --> 21:08.180
Though I guess I should
thank whoever taught you
how to please a woman.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.475
Maybe it was the
forest nymphs.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.359

poster back.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.827

(CLEARING THROAT)

21:38.047 --> 21:39.207
Hello.

21:40.049 --> 21:42.540
I'm looking to get
something on House.

21:42.676 --> 21:45.964
Couldn't you just
ask the love-nymphs
for the secret?

21:46.055 --> 21:47.295
Don't.

21:47.389 --> 21:51.974
My mission is to find
something that House would
not like to see made public,

21:52.061 --> 21:53.676
and make it public.

21:54.688 --> 21:55.939
In.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.681
But you know him
better than anyone,
why do you need my help?

21:58.776 --> 22:00.937
House would never leave
anything secret around
the condo.

22:01.070 --> 22:05.154
But you've worked in
the same office with him,
on and off, for years.

22:05.241 --> 22:09.325
Think back. Were there
ever any odd phone calls
or visitors from the past?

22:09.411 --> 22:11.823
He openly
brings prostitutes
into the hospital,

22:11.914 --> 22:14.997
and he gambles with bookies
because he's too lazy
to go to the OTB,

22:15.084 --> 22:16.870
and you're asking for...

22:17.628 --> 22:19.038
(LAUGHS)

22:19.922 --> 22:22.208
What? What? What?

22:23.092 --> 22:24.707
He's reading
The Golden Bowl.

22:24.802 --> 22:26.383
By Henry James?

22:26.470 --> 22:30.588
Yeah. No, he's not
really reading it.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.011
Okay. I don't understand.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.058
That book's at least
400 pages long,

22:35.145 --> 22:37.101
whatever he's reading
is only half that thick.

22:37.231 --> 22:40.439
Maybe he's reading a version
with a smaller font.

22:41.277 --> 22:43.689
He's not using
his reading glasses.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.360
That's a good point.

22:45.447 --> 22:48.234
He took the cover off
The Golden Bowl and put it
onto this other book,

22:48.325 --> 22:50.611
so no one would know
what he was reading.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.445
Whatever it is,
he's ashamed of it.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.200
Huh.

23:02.464 --> 23:05.956
I'm going with plastic.
It just makes more sense.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.011
I don't want another
operation later.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.131
That's not why
you're doing this.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.515
Look, when you were first
telling me about why
you love the Internet,

23:15.644 --> 23:18.306
you said that no one
has to be alone again.

23:18.439 --> 23:22.808
Whoever you are,
whatever you love, you
can connect with someone.

23:23.110 --> 23:25.351
If you want to recreate
the Boston Tea Party,

23:25.446 --> 23:27.937
while dressed as
Imperial Stormtroopers,

23:28.032 --> 23:30.990
you can find the 10 other
people in the world that
have always wanted to do that.

23:31.118 --> 23:32.949
That hasn't changed.

23:33.037 --> 23:34.117
But you have.

23:34.872 --> 23:37.955
This thing that you do,
it's not about connection
anymore.

23:38.042 --> 23:40.704
It's about an audience.
It's a performance,

23:40.836 --> 23:43.202
and you've got one eye
on the number of hits.

23:43.505 --> 23:46.793
You've turned our lives
into their entertainment.

23:51.513 --> 23:54.801
You're smart, you're fun
to read, it's okay.

23:56.185 --> 23:58.221
But don't give them this.

24:01.649 --> 24:05.858
Or if you do,
don't expect me to be here.

24:13.202 --> 24:16.319
It's a good cover choice.
It's not like anyone
would pick it up.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.369
It's Cameron's
favorite book.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.913
I don't even know
what it's about.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.040
Don't do that to yourself.

24:23.671 --> 24:24.877
What the hell?

24:29.551 --> 24:33.419
Giving him a computer
is like giving plutonium
to Dr. No.

"Step by Step: Sermons
for Everyday Life "?

Why would he read this?

24:56.912 --> 24:58.243
Why would he hide it?

24:58.372 --> 25:00.283
He reads the Bible,
he reads the Koran.

25:00.416 --> 25:03.624
He says he likes
to know what mistakes
people are making.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.128
You think he's sincere?

25:05.254 --> 25:07.245
You think that he's
actually getting
something out of this?

25:07.381 --> 25:08.871
I don't know.

25:09.466 --> 25:11.252
What a hypocrite.

25:12.428 --> 25:15.636
How can we use this
in a cruel yet funny way?

25:16.223 --> 25:17.759
You know what?

25:19.935 --> 25:22.267
Don't mention
this to anyone.

25:23.814 --> 25:25.429
So what was the point?

25:31.989 --> 25:34.776
Are you going to be
here when I wake up?

25:40.247 --> 25:43.614
I hate that you
don't have a blog,

25:43.709 --> 25:45.495
I hate that I don't know
what you're thinking.

Let's not get
into it right now.

25:50.007 --> 25:51.998
We need to get you
through surgery.

25:53.719 --> 25:56.210
I don't want to go in there
knowing you'll stick
with me through surgery

25:56.305 --> 25:58.421
'cause that's what
good guys do,

25:58.515 --> 26:00.051
but once I'm better,
you'll be gone.

Get her inside.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.580
Your appendix burst.
We had to remove it.

26:25.667 --> 26:31.162
And the biopsy confirms
it was full of abnormal cells
consistent with lymphoma.

26:35.469 --> 26:37.175
I have cancer?

26:37.304 --> 26:39.169
We've postponed
putting in the new valve.

26:39.306 --> 26:42.423
So, I mean, I guess we do,
what, chemo
and all that stuff?

26:42.518 --> 26:45.681
Yes, but apparently
you've had this
for some time.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.353
When your appendix burst,
it was like a dam giving way.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.182
Those cells went streaming
throughout your body.

26:51.318 --> 26:54.185
So you're saying
you'll treat, but you
don't expect it to work.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.861
That's why no valve.
It's pointless.

26:57.324 --> 27:00.612
Our Dean of Medicine
has approved an
experimental treatment.

27:00.702 --> 27:05.446
We use your unique cancer cell
signature to create a targeted
lymphoma vaccine.

27:05.541 --> 27:08.203
Okay. So that'll
cure me?

27:08.293 --> 27:10.784
Well, we're not
actually sure
what it'll do,

27:10.879 --> 27:13.211
but the intention
is to train your
immune system

27:13.340 --> 27:16.207
to recognize and kill
cells bearing the
same malignant signature,

27:16.343 --> 27:18.129
while leaving
healthy cells alone.

27:18.220 --> 27:22.463
But, as Dr. Foreman says,
it's experimental.

27:22.558 --> 27:23.638
I see.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.386
Without it,
what kind of time
are we talking about?

27:25.519 --> 27:27.350
An exact prognosis
is impossible.

27:27.437 --> 27:30.725
How about a guess?
Something, please.

27:32.401 --> 27:36.565
Based on people
in situations like yours,
maybe a year.

27:40.659 --> 27:44.026
Baby, whatever
we have to do,
we'll do.

27:44.705 --> 27:47.868
I can take care of you.
I can work from home.

27:51.086 --> 27:54.499
Sounds good.
Thank you for
letting me know.

We'll start
with the treatment
whenever it's ready.

28:04.933 --> 28:07.766
Is she being
a good soldier
or is she in denial?

28:07.895 --> 28:10.181
Denial's not unusual
for a first reaction.

28:10.272 --> 28:13.764
Or it could be a symptom.
Some lymphomas
affect cognition.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.850
If it is denial,
she needs time
to process.

28:15.944 --> 28:19.732
If it's a symptom,
hopefully treatment with
the vaccine will help.

28:23.911 --> 28:25.276
Hey, Sandy.

Can I borrow your car?

28:35.297 --> 28:36.457
She gave me the keys.

28:36.590 --> 28:38.546
You're a doctor,
she was doing you
a favor.

28:38.634 --> 28:40.966
She barely knows me.

28:41.053 --> 28:44.716
I've been deluding myself
that I'm actually
connecting with people.

28:49.394 --> 28:53.637
The first person I ever
fell in love with turned
out to be a total tool.

28:53.815 --> 28:56.807
He came across
all funny and charming
and thoughtful,

28:56.902 --> 28:58.142
but it was an act.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.317
He saw something
he wanted

28:59.446 --> 29:01.653
and he knew he had
to behave a certain
way to get it.

29:01.782 --> 29:06.492
In retrospect, the fact that
I was 17 and he was 30
should've been a clue.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.907
Figuring out
who people are
takes time.

29:10.499 --> 29:13.662
And it takes twice as
much time if they're
trying to impress you.

29:13.794 --> 29:16.661
Now, I could take from
this that anyone who
loans me their car

29:16.755 --> 29:17.915
has an ulterior motive,

29:18.006 --> 29:21.919
or I can accept
that it's just
a nice thing to do,

29:22.594 --> 29:24.835
and take people
as they come.

on and on...

This is messed up.

No.

29:57.296 --> 30:00.538

a patient with this name,
I looked it up.

from my therapist.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.092
No, it wasn't.

30:06.179 --> 30:09.888
No one you respect
would give you this and
expect it to be helpful.

30:09.975 --> 30:10.964
It's a book!

30:11.059 --> 30:12.435
Of sermons!

a psychotic break.

you have trouble,
sometimes,

30:26.241 --> 30:27.902
with the pain

Are you so
out of options

answers in what you
consider irrationality?

30:34.916 --> 30:36.702
I'm all right. Trust me.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.837
Are you all right
because you're
back on Vicodin?

30:43.425 --> 30:45.086
I said trust me.

means something.

you have been called
to witness by the Lord.

all these copies?
It's out of print.

Sure. Give up
and let her die

than speeding up
the schedule.

this come on?

Of the stimulating agent,
which added to
the first injection,

was full of cancer cells.

Your appendix was full
of cells that showed
a Iymphocytic atypia.

33:41.269 --> 33:45.057
We now think they were
a granulomatous build-up
from some unknown cause.

So I'm not dying?

33:55.909 --> 33:58.776

more quickly than we thought.

what's causing

Maybe we didn't
cause the fever.

We gave her the vaccine
and her fever spiked,
seems to me...

35:02.225 --> 35:05.638
Yes, but it persisted
after we took her
off the vaccine.

35:05.729 --> 35:07.845
What if it's
a new symptom?

35:09.608 --> 35:12.771
Okay, so we add
fever to cell atypia,

kidney, heart,
liver...

No one she knows is sick.
She hasn't travelled anywhere.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.449
There's nothing in
the history she gave us,
nothing in her blog.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.777
There has to be something
unique to this infection,

35:23.872 --> 35:26.454
something about
its transmission,
the way it manifests.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.873
There has to be something
she's not telling us.

35:29.002 --> 35:34.167
There isn't. She's told us,
and everyone else, everything.

35:38.845 --> 35:41.712
Start her on broad-
spectrum antibiotics.

35:43.224 --> 35:47.342

we might as well treat
for everything.

to invite you

I'd seen the

there's a picture
of the author.

when I recognized him.

Okay, he was
a friend of the family,

when you were a kid.

37:24.993 --> 37:27.325
But if you wanted
to meet him now,

37:27.454 --> 37:30.821
get an idea of what he's like,
why not just go talk to him?

"Hi, it's Greg.
You slept with my mother."

a phone call.

this was crap.

suddenly turn around

37:53.438 --> 37:56.726
and build a whole new
world-view based on crap.

37:57.859 --> 37:59.190
Crap.

38:02.197 --> 38:05.985
You better not be faking
this just to get out of
a tough conversation.

38:23.676 --> 38:26.713
Greasy and soft,
or hard and pellet-like?

38:33.895 --> 38:38.264
Floaters and the first one.

38:40.068 --> 38:43.231
You just had
to be so swoft.

38:44.447 --> 38:47.063
You're a hypocrite,
no lies, no secrets,

38:47.158 --> 38:48.739
but everything stops
at your colon.

38:48.868 --> 38:51.780
Four thousand pages,
not one word about BMs.

38:51.913 --> 38:53.278
And I bet yours
don't smell at all.

38:53.414 --> 38:55.405
Nobody wants to hear
about that stuff.
HOUSE: Readers don't.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.828
People who don't really
care about you don't,
but doctors might.

38:57.919 --> 39:00.126
The icky stuff
changed, right?
A few months ago.

39:00.255 --> 39:01.461
Well, I became
a vegetarian.

39:01.589 --> 39:04.126
A lot of people
misunderstand how
a vegetarian diet works.

39:04.259 --> 39:07.968
You take in less unusable
material, and your waste
gets more efficient,

39:08.096 --> 39:11.213
harder and rounder.
Just look at the
feces of rabbits.

39:11.766 --> 39:13.597
Seriously, I think
I might have some.
THIRTEEN: Malabsorption.

39:13.726 --> 39:16.058
Her system's not retaining
the necessary nutrients.

39:16.145 --> 39:18.522
A G! infection that
causes malabsorption,

39:18.606 --> 39:20.312
granulamatous
build-up of cells.

39:20.441 --> 39:22.727
It's not contagious,
'cause no one
around her got sick.

39:22.819 --> 39:24.980
BOTH: Whipple's Disease.

39:25.488 --> 39:29.276
Let's split the credit.
Start her on cotrimoxazole.

39:30.827 --> 39:32.658
We all need some secrets.

39:32.787 --> 39:36.575
So long as they don't kill us,
they keep us safe and warm.

39:40.587 --> 39:41.622
I'm...

39:43.756 --> 39:45.838
I'm gonna be okay?

39:45.925 --> 39:47.381
You'll still need
a new heart valve,

39:47.468 --> 39:52.007
and you'll be on meds for
a few years, but basically,
yeah, your odds are good.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.473
(SIGHING)

40:08.489 --> 40:09.820
Thank God.

40:14.454 --> 40:17.196
I think I wanna go
with the pig valve.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.828
(POP SONG PLAYING)

40:30.428 --> 40:33.135
I know you'll go crazy
if you don't tell people.

40:33.222 --> 40:35.508
Thank God
you're an enabler.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.396
Do you think people
can actually know
each other better

40:44.525 --> 40:46.106
on the Internet
than face-to-face?

40:46.194 --> 40:48.560
Faces can be
distracting,

40:48.696 --> 40:52.063
but there's nothing
better than looking
into someone's eyes

40:52.200 --> 40:53.781
and everything
that goes with that.

40:53.868 --> 40:58.658
I don't know.
People meet, they like
something superficial,

40:58.748 --> 41:01.330
and then they fill in
the blanks with whatever
they want to believe.

41:01.417 --> 41:02.953
Why are you
so hung up on this?

41:03.044 --> 41:06.628
I refuse to believe it's all
because you just noticed
you have a nice face.

41:06.714 --> 41:08.295
I mean, you just
came off a relationship,

41:08.383 --> 41:11.750
you know things
go deeper than...

41:13.972 --> 41:17.135
Is that what
this is about?
You and Cameron?

41:19.227 --> 41:21.718
I was the one
that pursued her.

41:22.146 --> 41:25.479
Maybe I was just filling
in the blanks, maybe...

41:25.692 --> 41:27.228
(SIGHING)

41:27.318 --> 41:28.694
Maybe her first
reaction was right.

41:28.778 --> 41:31.144
We were just two people
who were in proximity

41:31.239 --> 41:33.355
and found each
other attractive, and
I never should have...

41:33.449 --> 41:37.613
Paranoia.
You felt something
real. So did she.

41:38.079 --> 41:40.411
Don't try to take
it back now.

41:42.625 --> 41:44.581
Can I borrow your car?

41:46.004 --> 41:47.084
No.

41:55.346 --> 41:58.383
Why would it make
more sense for you to read
your father's book

41:58.474 --> 41:59.680
than to go talk with him?

41:59.767 --> 42:02.600
Can you write a book,
so I can stop talking
to you?

42:02.687 --> 42:04.018
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

42:10.820 --> 42:12.481
You weren't looking
for some big catharsis,

42:12.572 --> 42:13.903
you didn't want
to hug the guy.

42:13.990 --> 42:17.357
You just wanted to know
how his head works,
how he thinks.

42:17.452 --> 42:19.989
Because I'm fascinated
with how ministers think.

42:20.121 --> 42:21.986
Because you're not
ordinary, House.

42:22.123 --> 42:23.954
You're way out there
on the fringe somewhere.

42:24.042 --> 42:27.284
I'm your best friend,
and half the time
I don't understand you.

42:27.378 --> 42:30.620
You're alone,
you've been alone
your whole life.

42:33.009 --> 42:35.876
When you read
that book you were
hoping that somewhere,

42:35.970 --> 42:39.713
underneath all that talk
of God, there would
be a way of thinking,

42:39.807 --> 42:41.763
a mind that you
could recognize.

42:41.851 --> 42:44.058
You wanted
what we all want.

42:44.145 --> 42:46.727
The power to transform
into any water-based object?

42:46.814 --> 42:50.898
To look across the gulf
and know there's
someone else like you.

42:52.320 --> 42:55.812
At least tell me this,
did you find
something there?

42:57.158 --> 42:59.319
Underneath the God stuff,

43:00.078 --> 43:01.659
more God stuff.

43:07.210 --> 43:09.826
Get maintenance
to take that down.
