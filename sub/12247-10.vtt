00:01.006 --> 00:02.207
If you give me five minutes

00:02.213 --> 00:03.482
- with Proctor...
- Absolutely not.

00:03.487 --> 00:06.330
You are to have no further
contact with Proctor or her crew

00:06.336 --> 00:08.768
under any circumstances.
Do you understand?

00:08.774 --> 00:10.034
Hello, Shayne.

00:10.040 --> 00:12.834
Ferguson is still making plans,
okay. She's meeting contacts.

00:12.840 --> 00:15.301
- What contacts?
- Shayne Butler, Jiana's son.

00:15.307 --> 00:18.263
Ferguson wanted someone on the
outside to take out Nils Jesper.

00:18.269 --> 00:19.562
All right, I'll check it out.

00:19.568 --> 00:20.997
- Fuck!
- Look, all

00:21.003 --> 00:24.120
I'm trying to do is put away
the person who shopped you.

00:25.520 --> 00:29.964
You ever lay a hand on me, this goes
online, and your career'll be over.

00:29.970 --> 00:32.682
Do you remember once you
offered me something else?

00:32.688 --> 00:34.864
- Having a baby?
- Are you serious?

00:34.870 --> 00:37.608
Nash, it's me. I want to meet Miranda.

00:38.608 --> 00:40.590
No. Not here.

00:40.596 --> 00:41.901
How far to yours?

00:42.847 --> 00:45.195
Bea, I didn't have anything
to do with it! I swear to God.

00:45.201 --> 00:47.369
- I didn't know anything about it. Bea!
- Let's go!

00:47.374 --> 00:49.353
Oh, hon. You really
fell for her didn't you?

00:49.358 --> 00:52.565
- She played me all the way.
- She wasn't playing anyone.

00:53.038 --> 00:56.250
- Where is she?
- You tell me. She's all yours now.

03:10.083 --> 03:11.648
Was just trying to be nice.

03:11.654 --> 03:12.810
We got her Mr Stewart. We're all good.

03:12.816 --> 03:15.097
- Get her out of here.
- Right, come on.

03:16.227 --> 03:18.802
So, you gonna take care of her or not?

03:20.167 --> 03:21.864
You wanna pat my pussy, Mama?

03:25.245 --> 03:27.952
Nah, she's all yours.

03:27.958 --> 03:30.442
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on, baby, come on.

knock your fuckin' block off.

03:47.015 --> 03:48.756
I don't want her near me.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.081
She's a mess.

03:50.087 --> 03:51.719
Then don't take her money.

03:51.725 --> 03:53.125
Leave it alone, Smith.

03:53.131 --> 03:54.331
Yeah.

03:54.337 --> 03:55.804
All good, Mr Stewart.

04:02.397 --> 04:04.072
You just missed one
of the great pleasures

04:04.078 --> 04:06.083
of working with a bunch of randy women.

04:08.803 --> 04:10.405
Straight back into it then?

04:11.897 --> 04:14.191
Mate, don't feel embarrassed
about what happened.

04:15.168 --> 04:16.605
Did you tell anyone?

04:16.829 --> 04:19.028
No, I said I wouldn't.

04:19.034 --> 04:20.492
They got it on video.

04:22.586 --> 04:23.992
Kaz had a phone.

04:26.142 --> 04:28.634
- Let's do a cell toss.
- Oh, good.

04:29.423 --> 04:31.316
And tell the Governor what, exactly, eh?

04:31.322 --> 04:32.798
- Relax.
- Look, if this thing gets out

04:32.804 --> 04:34.751
- I'm fucked. Okay?
- Okay, okay.

04:34.757 --> 04:37.136
There is no way I'm getting kicked
out of here because of that little

04:37.142 --> 04:38.454
man-hating bitch!

04:38.460 --> 04:40.364
Sierra 5, this is Sierra2.

04:40.369 --> 04:41.706
Sierra 5, go ahead.

04:41.711 --> 04:43.702
Can I see you in my office, please?

04:44.576 --> 04:46.296
Yes Governor, on my way.

04:48.362 --> 04:50.065
- Hey, we'll fix this.
- Okay.

04:50.526 --> 04:51.726
Governor.

04:52.269 --> 04:53.469
Morning.

04:54.909 --> 04:57.528
Is the, ah, deputy governor in?

04:57.534 --> 05:00.254
- Yeah, he's back on board.
- Oh, is he feeling okay?

05:00.259 --> 05:01.782
Just a little rough around the edges.

05:01.788 --> 05:04.928
Or a little bit frustrated that
I won't let him question Proctor?

05:04.934 --> 05:06.866
No one's gonna lag, Vera.

05:08.159 --> 05:11.898
But, I am in full support of
you and working on Ferguson.

05:11.904 --> 05:13.194
Pleased to hear it.

05:15.646 --> 05:17.364
I had a great time last night.

05:17.370 --> 05:18.673
So did I.

05:20.023 --> 05:22.027
Just keep me up to date, Mr Stewart.

05:22.033 --> 05:23.465
- Yes, Governor.
- Mmm.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.401
- The name's Shayne Butler.
- _

05:32.631 --> 05:35.973
Oh, I've had a look at the file and
I reckon our office should handle it.

05:37.133 --> 05:38.938
Oh, yeah, we do a lot of those.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.144
So we'll take it from here, yeah?

05:42.103 --> 05:43.466
All right, cheers.

05:45.592 --> 05:47.949
So, if you can grab that file and
I'll see you down there in ten, yeah?

05:47.954 --> 05:50.869
- Ms Fessler?
- Oh, I'm due in court, Franky.

05:50.875 --> 05:53.308
Caulfield office want us to
take over one of their clients.

05:53.314 --> 05:55.354
Whoa. We've got our hands full, Franky.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.016
He's an indigenous kid,
a ward of the state.

05:57.021 --> 06:00.229
- Oh, you're gonna play that card.
- I'm tryin' to.

06:00.431 --> 06:02.927
- Yeah, go on. Hit me with it.
- Auto theft charge.

06:02.933 --> 06:04.425
Hearing's schedule for next week.

06:04.431 --> 06:05.665
I reckon if we talk to the DPP,

06:05.670 --> 06:07.461
we should be able to
get his charges reduced.

06:07.467 --> 06:10.234
- On what basis?
- Oh, long history disadvantage.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.641
And considering everything
he's been up against,

06:11.646 --> 06:13.065
I reckon he deserves a second chance.

06:13.070 --> 06:14.935
That's not really a
legal argument, Franky.

06:14.941 --> 06:16.141
Yet!

06:17.353 --> 06:19.534
Okay take a meeting. Write an assessment

06:19.540 --> 06:21.646
based on the interview
and I'll consider it.

06:21.652 --> 06:23.160
Cool! Sweet.

06:32.996 --> 06:34.196
Look who I found.

06:34.202 --> 06:36.180
- Hey, Max!
- Oh!

06:36.186 --> 06:37.551
- Oh.
- Hello.

06:37.557 --> 06:39.036
- Welcome back.
- Oh!

06:39.534 --> 06:41.418
Oh! oh.

06:41.424 --> 06:43.074
- All right, Susan.
- Yeah?

06:43.080 --> 06:44.984
- Take her things, put them in her cell.
- Yeah.

06:44.990 --> 06:48.434
Come in. And Liz, why don't you make
Maxine a nice cup of your herbal tea.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.558
Yeah, or maybe you'd
like us to rack off,

06:50.564 --> 06:51.949
- so you can settle in?
- No, no, I

06:51.955 --> 06:54.611
- just want things to be normal.
- Ooh, trust me, normal's overrated.

06:54.616 --> 06:56.586
No, really, the sooner we
can move on, the better,

06:56.592 --> 06:58.050
- okay?
- Oh, that's good, that's good.

06:58.055 --> 07:01.206
'Cause... I think it's time. Baby time.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.882
- You're ovulating?
- Uh, huh.

07:02.888 --> 07:04.445
- Are you sure?
- Yeah,

07:04.451 --> 07:07.796
I got... I got the horn real
bad, eh, and I got a... I got a...

07:07.802 --> 07:09.348
bit of a slip 'n' side
happenin' in me undies,

07:09.353 --> 07:11.088
- so, yeah, I reckon I am.
- Yes, yes, all right Susan.

07:11.093 --> 07:12.427
We get the picture.

07:12.938 --> 07:15.047
Okay, let's make this happen.

07:16.220 --> 07:18.990
- What's the first step?
- I make a call to Martin.

07:18.996 --> 07:20.398
Oh, how are we gonna get it in?

07:20.404 --> 07:21.834
He'll come to the visitor's centre.

07:22.411 --> 07:25.092
No. How're we gonna get it "in"?

07:25.094 --> 07:27.132
- Oh.
- Yeah.

07:27.611 --> 07:29.693
- Allie, fuck off!
- Just give me a taste.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.570
- Get away from us.
- Fuckin' bitches!

07:32.576 --> 07:34.435
- Hey, don't start!
- Well, you hand it over

07:34.441 --> 07:36.308
- when it suits ya, don't ya?
- Hey, leave.

07:39.515 --> 07:40.715
Hey.

07:42.359 --> 07:44.415
I thought you were supposed
to be looking after her.

07:44.421 --> 07:46.560
She was fine until you came along.

07:46.566 --> 07:47.889
Don't you put this back one me.

07:47.894 --> 07:50.526
What? She was clean. I got her
there. Do you know what that takes?

07:51.029 --> 07:52.819
Well, she needs to pull her head in.

07:55.256 --> 07:56.856
What are you staring at?

07:57.034 --> 07:58.234
Leave it, eh?

07:58.240 --> 08:00.489
Why the fuck is everybody looking at me?

08:00.495 --> 08:01.695
Come on, let's go.

08:02.356 --> 08:03.653
They want me, Bea.

08:12.403 --> 08:14.911
- Shayne Butler.
- Ah, yes, take a seat.

08:21.230 --> 08:23.456
Shayne? Hey.

08:23.636 --> 08:26.093
I'm Franky, I'm the paralegal
dealin' with your case.

08:26.099 --> 08:27.614
Yeah, and?

08:28.330 --> 08:29.536
Come on.

08:30.062 --> 08:32.270
I've had a look over your
file and, from what I read,

08:32.275 --> 08:35.236
you weren't even in the stolen
vehicle at the time of the arrest.

08:36.863 --> 08:38.106
No comment.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.859
I'm on your side, you can talk to me.

08:44.135 --> 08:45.707
Nice tatts.

08:46.629 --> 08:47.879
Ta.

08:47.884 --> 08:49.891
- I've got one.
- Yeah?

08:50.868 --> 08:52.497
Cross your heart, hope to die.

08:52.503 --> 08:54.303
Stick a needle in your eye.

08:55.246 --> 08:57.689
Yeah, it's like never forget
what you promise, you know?

08:57.694 --> 08:59.194
Yeah. That's cool.

09:02.569 --> 09:04.836
You don't look much like a lawyer.

09:06.637 --> 09:08.754
You don't look much like a criminal.

09:10.832 --> 09:13.178
I reckon I can get your charges reduced.

09:13.184 --> 09:16.311
- For real?
- Maybe, but we gotta do some work.

09:16.794 --> 09:19.509
- Like what?
- Well, first things first.

09:19.515 --> 09:23.001
Tell me about, uh, your background,
family, that sort of stuff.

09:23.007 --> 09:26.524
No family. Mum's dead.
Don't know who Dad is.

09:26.530 --> 09:29.446
And what about your friends?
Any mates in trouble?

09:29.452 --> 09:30.726
Nothin' major.

09:31.638 --> 09:33.131
None of them are doing time?

09:33.427 --> 09:35.215
- No way.
- Hmm.

09:35.221 --> 09:39.037
Um, so we need someone who can vouch
for you, like a character witness.

09:39.286 --> 09:40.599
Um...

09:41.881 --> 09:43.534
maybe Aunty Joan?

09:45.092 --> 09:48.096
- Who's Aunty Joan?
- She's my godmother.

09:48.102 --> 09:50.637
I just met her, really.
She, um... she knew me mum.

09:50.643 --> 09:52.466
I'll be back, I'm just
getting some dressings.

09:52.471 --> 09:53.787
Tell me more about her.

09:53.793 --> 09:57.900
She looks a bit like, um, you know
that chick from 101 Dalmatians?

09:58.952 --> 10:01.156
- Cruella de Vil?
- Yeah, that one.

10:01.445 --> 10:02.854
That's who she looks like.

10:04.493 --> 10:07.143
You're feeling my pain, Mr Stewart?

10:07.948 --> 10:09.815
Must be rather dull for you.

10:09.963 --> 10:14.378
Standing around in here when you could
be back out there, seeing the sights.

10:14.869 --> 10:17.399
To be honest, I find you interesting.

10:17.405 --> 10:18.605
- Do you?
- Yes.

10:18.611 --> 10:21.006
- Oh.
- Well, compared to the other prisoners.

10:21.012 --> 10:23.666
Oh, thought you were about
to pay me a compliment.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.662
I've been warned about you, Joan.

10:27.966 --> 10:30.552
Don't be too sure of
anything anyone tells you...

10:31.255 --> 10:32.632
Jake.

10:32.856 --> 10:36.092
Even I fell victim to the
internal politics of this place.

10:36.098 --> 10:38.700
Mmm. Perhaps you could advise me?

10:39.059 --> 10:41.679
- Why would I do that?
- We're stuck with each other.

10:41.685 --> 10:42.960
It might be fun.

10:44.281 --> 10:47.078
Vera a bit too vanilla for you, Jake?

10:48.362 --> 10:51.296
Okay, let's get this arm dressed.

10:54.638 --> 10:57.401
Bea? Bea!

10:58.099 --> 11:00.572
They've got Allie. Juice and her crew.

11:01.279 --> 11:02.479
Where?

11:03.200 --> 11:04.778
Shouldn't you two be at work?

11:04.787 --> 11:07.215
- This is none of your business
- Oh, yeah?

11:07.221 --> 11:08.504
Yeah, you're up.

11:08.510 --> 11:12.359
No, no, no. She was stealin' stuff
from my cell. I caught her in there.

11:12.365 --> 11:14.598
Yeah, why didn't you quit
while you were ahead, Juice?

11:14.604 --> 11:17.328
No, no, no, no. It is my right.

11:17.334 --> 11:18.749
She is a thief.

11:18.755 --> 11:20.771
Oh, yeah? How about next time
I put you in a wheelchair,

11:20.776 --> 11:23.950
you won't get out of it? Huh? Huh?

11:26.125 --> 11:27.510
Yeah! Come on.

11:28.328 --> 11:30.328
And don't you touch her again!

11:31.023 --> 11:32.379
Must be love.

11:40.463 --> 11:41.962
Do you need to go to Medical?

11:42.785 --> 11:43.985
I'm okay.

11:48.033 --> 11:50.994
I would've ripped their heads off
in another couple of minutes, anyway.

11:51.609 --> 11:53.033
Sure.

11:55.484 --> 11:57.494
Get outta here. Go on.

12:00.744 --> 12:02.192
Bea....

12:02.917 --> 12:04.657
I've missed you.

12:10.410 --> 12:12.749
I've missed you so much.

12:14.012 --> 12:15.926
Please talk to me.

12:17.810 --> 12:19.010
But you're a mess.

12:19.015 --> 12:20.313
I'm not.

12:20.984 --> 12:24.507
I'm not. I'm good, I'm
good. I just... I miss you.

12:25.624 --> 12:26.979
- I need you.
- No.

12:26.985 --> 12:28.846
I'll stop. I'll stop using. I promise.

12:28.852 --> 12:31.039
I won't... I won't go near
the stuff again. I promise.

12:31.045 --> 12:32.328
It's not the drugs.

12:34.624 --> 12:37.845
This, you and me, whatever it was,

12:41.908 --> 12:43.108
it's done.

12:45.144 --> 12:48.378
You know what it was, you're
just too scared to admit it.

12:49.079 --> 12:51.373
Whatever you need to tell
yourself is fine by me.

12:53.180 --> 12:54.794
I...

12:55.376 --> 12:57.703
I can still feel you.

13:04.104 --> 13:06.816
- Please listen to me!
- You listen to me!

13:07.587 --> 13:08.787
This is it!

13:08.791 --> 13:11.236
This is the last time I save your arse.

13:12.916 --> 13:14.534
I love you.

13:22.299 --> 13:24.009
That's a shame.

13:35.442 --> 13:36.775
Through you go.

13:44.482 --> 13:47.225
Yes! Yes!

13:47.231 --> 13:49.910
Hi, baby. Hi, Joshy.

13:50.115 --> 13:53.741
- How's my little man?
- Doreen, this is Miranda.

13:53.747 --> 13:55.671
- Hiya.
- It's so good to meet you.

13:55.677 --> 13:57.177
- Oh, you, too.
- Lovely. Mwah!

13:57.183 --> 13:58.505
I've heard so much about you.

13:58.510 --> 13:59.710
Me too.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.537
Oh, come on. Oh, are we a bit grizzly?

14:02.543 --> 14:04.757
Are we a bit grizzly
this morning, hey, honey?

14:04.763 --> 14:07.381
I don't know why. He
had such a great sleep.

14:07.387 --> 14:10.800
Thanks so much for helping us out,
hey. Just till Nash finds a job.

14:10.806 --> 14:13.900
- It's real generous of ya.
- Ah... nah, it's my pleasure.

14:13.905 --> 14:16.254
Oh, nah, come on, it must
be the last thing you want.

14:16.260 --> 14:18.248
You've got a toddler
screaming around the house

14:18.254 --> 14:20.227
and now a baby, as well.

14:20.233 --> 14:22.376
No, he's a dream, your little man.

14:22.382 --> 14:25.202
Oh, we must need a walk
around the room, eh?

14:25.208 --> 14:26.481
Stand him on your lap,

14:26.487 --> 14:27.784
- he likes to use his legs.
- Yeah.

14:27.789 --> 14:30.220
- He's really into it.
- Shhhhhh.

14:30.226 --> 14:33.233
Should see Mia with him, Dors. She
loves having a little brother around,

14:33.239 --> 14:35.285
- doesn't she?
- Yeah, such a nice age gap.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.755
- Ay-yi-yi-yi.
- Actually, we've printed out some

14:36.760 --> 14:38.174
photos for you.

14:38.872 --> 14:41.006
- That's a great shot in the park.
- Yeah.

14:41.441 --> 14:43.670
Yeah, me and Joshy are
spending heaps of time together.

14:45.958 --> 14:47.597
Just remember, um...

14:48.041 --> 14:49.702
this is all temporary.

14:50.037 --> 14:52.638
Come on, Dor, it's good for
him to spend time with Mia.

14:52.644 --> 14:54.785
I just don't want Josh getting
too attached to something

14:54.790 --> 14:56.181
that's gonna change.

14:56.565 --> 14:58.255
Oh, and no offence, it's just,

14:58.261 --> 15:00.125
he's had a lot of stuffing around.

15:00.130 --> 15:02.238
Yeah, well, they are
brother and sister, Dor.

15:02.253 --> 15:04.883
- Half.
- Now, come on, be reasonable, please.

15:04.889 --> 15:06.094
I am.

15:06.100 --> 15:09.592
- Honey, come on. Come on, baby.
- Here, let me see what's wrong.

15:10.206 --> 15:12.611
Hello, mate! What's wrong?

15:12.616 --> 15:15.070
Watch this, Daddy's going to
calm you down in two seconds.

15:22.450 --> 15:23.793
- Doreen, hi.
- I think

15:23.799 --> 15:25.841
Josh should be back in here with me.

15:25.847 --> 15:27.702
Are you concerned about the way Nash

15:27.708 --> 15:30.270
- is looking after him?
- Oh, no, no, Nash is a great dad.

15:30.276 --> 15:31.979
So, why the change of heart?

15:34.168 --> 15:36.533
Josh is bonding to another woman.

15:36.539 --> 15:38.584
Nash's housemate, his ex-girlfriend.

15:38.590 --> 15:41.584
You know any nurturing that
he gets is really healthy.

15:41.590 --> 15:43.277
And then what happens when I get out?

15:43.283 --> 15:47.726
I know this is incredibly difficult for
you Doreen, but no matter what happens,

15:47.732 --> 15:51.059
Josh and you, the bond
will never be broken.

15:52.245 --> 15:54.054
I want him back!

15:54.060 --> 15:55.575
I miss him.

15:55.581 --> 15:58.091
Mmm. Only 8 more months.

15:58.638 --> 16:03.347
But I'm gonna miss his
first step, his first word.

16:03.353 --> 16:06.384
It's gotta be better
for him to be with me.

16:06.946 --> 16:09.925
Maybe... if you can
speak to the Board...

16:09.931 --> 16:12.418
You, are a fantastic mum.

16:12.424 --> 16:16.345
Your initial instincts were right.
Wentworth is not a place for a baby.

16:17.079 --> 16:19.474
- So, you won't help me?
- Of course I'm going to help you!

16:19.480 --> 16:21.149
For a start we can work out a more

16:21.155 --> 16:22.704
regular visitation schedule.

16:22.709 --> 16:24.159
We can talk to Nash.

16:25.944 --> 16:28.069
You just don't get it, do ya?

16:28.572 --> 16:30.281
You're not a mother.

16:37.677 --> 16:39.855
Sierra 2, this is Sierra 5.

16:40.020 --> 16:42.427
Your assistance is
required in the plant room.

16:42.433 --> 16:43.841
On my way, Sierra 5.

16:57.654 --> 16:58.854
Mr Stewart.

16:58.860 --> 17:00.060
Governor.

17:01.363 --> 17:02.563
Jimmy?

17:04.059 --> 17:06.199
Boiler's cactus, needs replacing.

17:06.204 --> 17:08.394
- It's going to cost a bit.
- Oh, how much?

17:09.722 --> 17:12.038
- You need to approve the work order.
- Yeah, yep, yeah, of course.

17:12.042 --> 17:14.198
That's fine. You can just...

17:14.673 --> 17:16.766
you just go ahead.

17:18.970 --> 17:20.193
Thanks, mate.

17:22.263 --> 17:23.893
So... um, how are...

17:23.898 --> 17:26.477
How are things with Ferguson?

17:28.648 --> 17:30.140
She hasn't mentioned much.

17:30.146 --> 17:31.524
What, nothing?

17:31.942 --> 17:33.809
Nothing... relevant.

17:36.052 --> 17:37.660
She um...

17:38.838 --> 17:41.819
she called you "vanilla".

17:43.108 --> 17:44.537
"Vanilla"?

17:45.506 --> 17:46.922
She's saying I'm boring.

17:46.928 --> 17:48.904
- Look, I'm not sure that she meant...
- No, that is her way of undermining

17:48.909 --> 17:50.398
my authority with you.
She can't help herself.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.603
- She... "vanilla"!
- Vera...

17:51.609 --> 17:54.645
You're the one who warned me not
to let her get inside my head.

17:55.231 --> 17:57.297
You haven't said
anything to her, about us,

17:57.303 --> 17:58.858
- have you?
- Of course not.

18:00.702 --> 18:02.208
Just... "vanilla"?!

18:05.457 --> 18:08.863
Yeah, but like, h-how... how
are we gonna get the jizz like,

18:09.269 --> 18:11.004
far enough up me bang hole?

18:11.010 --> 18:13.761
Oh, for goodness sake
Susan, you need a syringe!

18:13.768 --> 18:16.501
- Oh! Oh! The queen has spoken, eh?
- Hey...

18:16.507 --> 18:20.680
Well, listening to you work out a
problem, is like watching a kitten knit!

18:20.686 --> 18:22.499
You're like watching a kitten...

18:22.505 --> 18:23.765
- Hey! Hey!
- Shut up!

18:23.771 --> 18:25.704
- This is meant to be a happy thing.
- Yeah, guys,

18:25.709 --> 18:27.786
we gotta work together
to make it happen, yeah?

18:29.902 --> 18:31.836
Well, how am I gonna get a syringe?

18:33.750 --> 18:34.968
Jenkins for you.

18:34.974 --> 18:37.475
Oh, hi... hi nurse.

18:37.481 --> 18:40.098
Yeah, I feel really crook, eh? I...

18:40.395 --> 18:41.800
What's the problem?

18:41.806 --> 18:45.110
I think it's the food from lunch. I
might have had some undercooked chook.

18:46.356 --> 18:47.858
Yep, straight through.

18:52.017 --> 18:53.321
How are you?

18:54.069 --> 18:55.395
I'm not bad.

18:55.401 --> 18:56.781
You're recovering okay?

18:57.483 --> 18:59.196
I'm still pretty sore.

18:59.649 --> 19:01.327
You're still gorgeous.

19:04.258 --> 19:05.794
Did you get to the clinic?

19:06.257 --> 19:07.753
It's in my pocket.

19:12.423 --> 19:14.275
- You're warm.
- Yeah.

19:14.281 --> 19:15.481
Lie down.

19:15.966 --> 19:19.387
Oh, no, I reckon I could
just lie down in me cell, eh?

19:19.470 --> 19:22.387
I-I think I just need somethin'
to plug me up, you know?

19:22.393 --> 19:24.498
Okay, I'll get you something.
Just wait here a sec.

19:24.504 --> 19:25.704
Okay.

19:32.758 --> 19:33.958
Maxine,

19:34.294 --> 19:35.693
I wouldn't be a friend

19:35.943 --> 19:39.246
unless I reminded you why
you put that sperm on ice.

19:39.252 --> 19:41.665
You wanted a family, a husband, a home.

19:41.671 --> 19:44.257
- But I'm here now. Martin, please.
- But not forever...

19:44.263 --> 19:48.489
I know my brother, Gary, is a bloody
idiot, but not everybody is like that.

19:50.067 --> 19:53.064
I'm doing my best to reassure
everyone else it's gonna be fine,

19:53.070 --> 19:55.298
but I don't know if it
is gonna be fine, Martin.

19:55.304 --> 19:56.950
Maxine, don't say that.

19:56.957 --> 20:00.232
I have to grab every chance I've
got in case it's the last one.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.000
So...

20:04.679 --> 20:06.284
how do we do this?

20:08.313 --> 20:09.719
Under the table.

20:19.269 --> 20:20.799
Did the women get back to you?

20:20.805 --> 20:22.423
- No, not yet.
- Ah.

20:28.382 --> 20:31.061
- What are you doing?
- Nothin'.

20:31.067 --> 20:33.039
- What's in your hand?
- Nothin'.

20:34.258 --> 20:37.262
Officer Miles! She's taken something.

20:37.268 --> 20:38.468
No.

20:38.696 --> 20:40.584
- Show me what you've got Jenkins.
- No.

20:40.590 --> 20:43.210
Show me. What's in your hand?!

20:47.736 --> 20:49.409
What were you planning
on doing with that?

20:51.068 --> 20:52.354
You're in the slot.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.008
- No! No!
- Erickson!

20:54.014 --> 20:55.843
- No, I'm not fuckin' going anywhere!
- Yes, you are. Yeah,

20:55.848 --> 20:57.719
- you're going in the slot. No,
- No, you leave me the fuck alone!

20:57.724 --> 20:59.285
- in the slot!
- No!

21:01.735 --> 21:04.157
So, no one has ever mentioned
Helen's depression to ya?

21:04.164 --> 21:06.065
Mm... nope, never.

21:06.071 --> 21:08.105
Well, maybe it's the
real reason she's missing.

21:08.111 --> 21:10.039
No, the real reason is Sonia killed her.

21:10.045 --> 21:11.668
The depressionâs bullshit, Liz.

21:11.674 --> 21:13.549
It's just like her
husband's cancer story.

21:13.555 --> 21:16.303
Oh, God. Well, how am I ever
going to get her to tell the truth?

21:16.309 --> 21:17.750
You've just got to put
a bit of pressure on her.

21:17.755 --> 21:21.498
Yeah, I have and she thinks I'm nosy and
I ask too many bloody questions, so...

21:21.504 --> 21:23.394
- So, what?
- So, what do I do with that?

21:24.897 --> 21:27.298
Look mate, I-I reckon she's onto me.

21:27.304 --> 21:29.489
No, now you're just being paranoid, Liz.

21:29.495 --> 21:31.336
Don't ask her direct questions.

21:31.342 --> 21:34.332
- Use your own story to elicit hers.
- How do I do that?

21:34.338 --> 21:36.078
By opening up about your own situation.

21:36.084 --> 21:37.525
What about my situation?

21:37.531 --> 21:39.717
How you came to be in here,
what happened, you know.

21:39.723 --> 21:40.938
Yeah, yeah, I know.

21:41.422 --> 21:43.265
- Yeah, I'll give, I'll give that a go.
- Yeah?

21:43.271 --> 21:44.541
- Yeah.
- Okay.

21:45.633 --> 21:47.995
I really appreciate
what you're doing, Liz.

21:48.308 --> 21:50.621
And you're doing really
well. Just hang in there.

21:54.990 --> 21:57.982
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, God!

21:58.143 --> 22:02.049
You know, I never thought I'd
end up surrounded by this lot.

22:02.055 --> 22:04.751
Eh, they're a motley crew.

22:04.757 --> 22:07.530
Yeah. I guess you never quite know

22:07.536 --> 22:10.364
what you can do till someone
pushes you hard enough.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.704
Well, what do you mean?

22:11.710 --> 22:13.952
Oh, well, how I ended up in here.

22:14.215 --> 22:17.451
You know, there was this
party and I got really pissed.

22:17.457 --> 22:21.255
My mother-in-law had been digging
at me all day and I was sick of it.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.634
Drove a tractor into her.

22:23.835 --> 22:25.125
A tractor?

22:25.642 --> 22:27.798
- Wow, you don't muck around.
- Yeah.

22:27.804 --> 22:29.311
And I just thought, "I've had enough".

22:29.316 --> 22:31.996
I mean, she was so mean,
all the bloody time.

22:32.002 --> 22:36.163
And I'm chugging towards her and she's
just standing there, you know, like

22:36.437 --> 22:38.156
"You wouldn't dare, Elizabeth".

22:38.162 --> 22:39.935
- Arrogant.
- Yeah. That's it, that's it.

22:39.941 --> 22:41.710
Yeah, and as I got close
to her, I just, you know,

22:41.715 --> 22:45.561
I felt my foot get really
heavy, on the accelerator.

22:46.066 --> 22:50.234
And then all of a sudden,
I just went vroooooooooom.

22:52.548 --> 22:53.748
Flattened her.

22:55.726 --> 22:57.015
That's, uh...

22:57.993 --> 22:59.249
Wow!

22:59.426 --> 23:01.811
Yeah, I copped a manslaughter charge.

23:03.161 --> 23:04.466
Wow!

23:05.162 --> 23:06.972
Thanks for sharing that with me, Liz.

23:06.977 --> 23:09.619
Oh, no, it's good to
talk about it actually.

23:10.093 --> 23:11.463
Yeah, it feels good.

23:13.386 --> 23:16.277
Booms! I got a pressie for you.

23:16.283 --> 23:18.409
- Are we in business?
- Where's Boomer?

23:18.415 --> 23:20.526
I haven't seen her.
Dor, have you seen Booms?

23:20.730 --> 23:21.946
She's in the slot.

23:21.952 --> 23:23.624
- What?
- Had a row in Medical.

23:23.630 --> 23:25.102
Yeah, it's melting.

23:25.108 --> 23:28.311
You've got your own sperm
hidden inside your own snatch?

23:28.317 --> 23:29.851
That's gotta be a first.

23:29.857 --> 23:32.463
We've got a very narrow
window of opportunity here.

23:32.469 --> 23:34.695
Leave it exactly where it is.
It'll stay the right temperature

23:34.700 --> 23:36.243
- in there.
- No, no, it won't survive overnight,

23:36.248 --> 23:38.471
- Sonia. How?!
- We will get it to Boomer,

23:38.477 --> 23:40.513
- Liz? You up for a challenge.
- Mm.

23:40.751 --> 23:41.951
Yeah.

23:46.829 --> 23:49.128
- Jesus Christ! How many times...
- Wait, wait, wait.

23:49.134 --> 23:50.848
- You've been told, leave us alone.
- Yeah, no, I have cash

23:50.853 --> 23:52.145
- Yeah, your fucking money is
- this time.

23:52.150 --> 23:53.572
- no good here.
- Well, just, so, tell me,

23:53.577 --> 23:54.920
who else is holding then.

23:54.926 --> 23:57.405
I can make you understand!

23:57.892 --> 24:01.893
- Allie, hey. Are you right?
- Yeah, I... I'm just leaving.

24:03.235 --> 24:04.926
What? What do you want, huh?

24:07.682 --> 24:08.976
What's on the menu?

24:10.312 --> 24:11.604
Whatever you want.

24:13.515 --> 24:15.186
The report on Shayne Butler.

24:15.962 --> 24:17.295
Leave it on my desk.

24:19.724 --> 24:21.321
We need to move on this.

24:21.822 --> 24:24.277
- What's the urgency, Franky?
- His hearing's next week.

24:24.283 --> 24:25.789
Yeah, and I'll do it before then.

24:27.070 --> 24:28.276
Okay.

24:28.793 --> 24:29.993
I'll just...

24:34.997 --> 24:37.245
Yeah, it's kind of a techno ***.

24:37.557 --> 24:39.246
Going over, read...

24:44.305 --> 24:45.634
- Hey, it's Franky Doyle from
- Yeah,

24:45.640 --> 24:47.119
- Legal Relief.
- and it's mostly...

24:47.125 --> 24:51.213
I need to speak to the prosecutor
in charge of Shayne Butler's case.

24:51.380 --> 24:54.105
Met with her after the
dinner break, okay. Yeah?

24:54.487 --> 24:56.005
Good. Off you go.

24:57.733 --> 24:59.770
- Have you got anything with you?
- Nah, piss off.

24:59.776 --> 25:01.639
- Are you sure?
- Just piss off.

25:02.889 --> 25:04.401
You're kidding me.

25:08.843 --> 25:10.445
- Yeah, fuck off!
- What's up with you?

25:10.929 --> 25:13.608
Come on, let's go. I don't want to
stay here and watch this. Come on.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.251
- Come on, I've got cash.
- Not for you, mate.

25:15.256 --> 25:16.971
- How much do you want?
- Fuck off.

25:33.148 --> 25:34.852
There's a phone in here.

25:35.239 --> 25:36.839
- What?
- Don't look at me.

25:37.349 --> 25:39.251
Kaz Proctor has a phone.

25:40.189 --> 25:41.772
What's that got to do with me?

25:42.491 --> 25:44.420
You're gonna get me that phone.

25:44.678 --> 25:46.910
- Why would I do that?
- You get me what I want,

25:46.916 --> 25:48.350
I give you what you need.

25:50.873 --> 25:52.267
What do I need?

25:52.690 --> 25:54.178
A g-bag?

25:54.184 --> 25:55.968
That should fix you up, shouldn't it?

25:58.075 --> 25:59.974
You get me that phone, we have a deal.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.623
She's not his mother.

26:06.629 --> 26:09.931
- Stop freaking out.
- I'm not freaking out, okay.

26:09.937 --> 26:11.593
What I'm saying is...

26:11.599 --> 26:14.505
if you agree, they might reconsider
letting me having him back.

26:14.511 --> 26:17.351
We agreed that he's better off out here.

26:17.651 --> 26:21.191
I need him and he needs me!

26:21.197 --> 26:23.627
Josh is getting everything
he could possibly want.

26:23.633 --> 26:24.983
I want him back!

26:24.989 --> 26:26.688
Anderson, bring it down a notch.

26:27.074 --> 26:29.119
Nash? Nash?

26:29.125 --> 26:30.481
For fuck's sake!

26:31.357 --> 26:32.681
Need some quiet time in the slot?

26:32.687 --> 26:34.580
I have a right to a personal phone call.

26:34.586 --> 26:36.343
No, it's okay. We're going.

26:36.764 --> 26:37.965
Come on!

26:38.583 --> 26:39.783
You okay?

26:39.789 --> 26:43.065
He says I need to "settle down".

26:43.149 --> 26:47.237
Nash and that chick he's livin' with,

26:47.422 --> 26:52.073
they're making a perfect
little family with my kid.

26:52.079 --> 26:55.105
Oh, Dors. We can deal with this.

26:55.286 --> 26:58.516
- I just want my baby.
- Oh, God,

26:58.522 --> 27:00.462
I know, sweetheart, I know.

27:03.739 --> 27:07.070
Let me out! Please!

27:07.076 --> 27:08.923
Pleeeeeease!!!!

27:09.864 --> 27:12.104
Yeah, you gotta get me out of here.

27:12.110 --> 27:13.315
Take the tray, Jenkins.

27:13.321 --> 27:15.944
No, I don't want the tray!

27:15.950 --> 27:18.221
Take the bloody tray, Jenkins!

27:20.858 --> 27:22.648
I'm fuckin' sick.

27:23.260 --> 27:24.956
Ow! Fuck!

27:51.362 --> 27:53.479
So, I just think he
needs a gentle reminder

27:53.485 --> 27:55.701
of his responsibilities
to the child's mother.

27:56.784 --> 27:58.282
ASAP.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.565
Good. Ta.

28:01.972 --> 28:03.342
Hey.

28:03.854 --> 28:05.237
You okay?

28:06.885 --> 28:09.097
- Yep.
- You don't fuckin' look it.

28:09.479 --> 28:12.406
You have gotta get off this
shit before you get hooked again.

28:12.412 --> 28:14.854
I'm not using again. I
just had a little taste.

28:16.236 --> 28:18.933
Then let's not go there again, okay?

28:19.708 --> 28:20.908
Come here.

28:58.925 --> 29:01.489
You ever lay a hand on me,

29:01.495 --> 29:04.504
or any of the other girls, ever again,

29:04.510 --> 29:06.736
this goes online and
your career is over.

29:13.110 --> 29:14.931
Sierra 2, this is Sierra 5.

29:25.341 --> 29:26.966
Where's the plumber?

29:28.841 --> 29:30.490
I've got a surprise for you.

29:30.496 --> 29:32.888
Oh, yeah, I don't really
have time for surprises.

29:33.050 --> 29:35.998
Where are we going? What are you doing?

29:36.902 --> 29:38.785
- Turn around.
- Excuse me?

29:39.383 --> 29:40.583
What?

29:41.246 --> 29:43.412
- Oh.
- <i>♪ [Mating Call by Alexander Junior] ♪</i>

29:43.418 --> 29:45.851
Um... ooh...

29:46.999 --> 29:48.547

29:48.553 --> 29:50.472
Just... just go with this.

29:51.533 --> 29:53.189
- Uh-uh-uh.
- Ooh-ooh-ooh.

29:53.195 --> 29:55.977
- <i>♪ Uh, uh, whoa, whoa ♪</i>
- Just do as you're told, Governor.

29:57.035 --> 30:00.693
- <i>♪ Yeah, yeah ♪</i>
- What?

30:01.229 --> 30:06.463
- <i>♪ You lie and you take a bow ♪</i>
- She doesn't have a clue about you.

30:06.469 --> 30:10.069
- <i>♪ Start war and you take a bow ♪</i>
- You're not vanilla at all, Vera.

30:11.453 --> 30:13.359

30:13.367 --> 30:17.170

30:17.744 --> 30:19.296
What do you want me to call you?

30:20.090 --> 30:21.790
Uh...

30:21.796 --> 30:24.617
- Oh, fuck!
- Come on, you can make some noise.

30:26.320 --> 30:31.009
<i>♪ You want to blame your shit on me ♪</i>

30:31.015 --> 30:34.452
Oh! Oh!

30:36.513 --> 30:39.552
So I took a bit of a risk.
Called the DPP myself,

30:39.558 --> 30:40.997
and we have work to do.

30:42.168 --> 30:44.578
Now, you need a job
and a fixed address...

30:44.584 --> 30:45.855
Did they say I'd get off?

30:45.860 --> 30:48.119
Ah, not yet,

30:48.125 --> 30:50.935
they just have a list of
concerns that we need to address.

30:50.941 --> 30:53.524
Hey, chin up, yeah?

30:53.530 --> 30:55.330
We're not givin' up yet are we?

30:55.976 --> 30:58.235
- No.
- Okay.

30:58.241 --> 30:59.764
So where are you living right now?

30:59.769 --> 31:01.476
Mainly on Frosty's couch.

31:01.482 --> 31:03.603
Well, you need to find
something more permanent.

31:03.609 --> 31:05.640
- Yeah, okay.
- And what about work?

31:06.827 --> 31:08.132
Start lookin'.

31:12.690 --> 31:14.502
You're a cool chick, Franky.

31:18.430 --> 31:19.640
You wanted to see me, Governor?

31:19.645 --> 31:20.845
Yes. Come in.

31:21.170 --> 31:22.703
Ferguson's made a request

31:22.709 --> 31:24.898
- to see Shayne Butler again.
- Okay.

31:24.904 --> 31:27.289
Well, I want you to confer
more closely with Mr Stewart.

31:27.295 --> 31:28.731
I can handle this on my own.

31:29.204 --> 31:32.110
- Don't have to be so defensive.
- You put me on a warning.

31:32.116 --> 31:34.408
That is because I felt you'd shown lack

31:34.414 --> 31:36.765
of judgement when it
comes to Kaz Proctor.

31:38.247 --> 31:39.447
Look...

31:39.453 --> 31:42.788
I do realise that I have
been tough on you recently.

31:43.270 --> 31:47.145
But you should know that I consider
you an invaluable part of my team.

31:48.305 --> 31:49.836
Thank you, Governor.

31:51.590 --> 31:53.105
Really, I appreciate it.

31:53.996 --> 31:56.923
You know as well as I do
that Ferguson will not stop.

31:58.124 --> 31:59.457
So, neither will we.

31:59.462 --> 32:00.662
Agreed.

32:02.740 --> 32:05.310
One of the other officers'll
take you back to Medical.

32:08.873 --> 32:10.073
Hm.

32:10.344 --> 32:12.686
You're looking very smart today, Shayne.

32:12.692 --> 32:14.252
Have to find me a job.

32:14.258 --> 32:17.321
Good for you. What sort
of job are you looking for?

32:17.327 --> 32:18.787
Somethin' with cars.

32:18.793 --> 32:20.208
You need an apprenticeship.

32:20.214 --> 32:22.696
Yeah, except I don't have
that much school behind me.

32:22.702 --> 32:24.483
Oh, it shouldn't matter,
bright boy like you.

32:25.519 --> 32:28.020
Well, the chick at the legal
centre, said if I could get a job,

32:28.026 --> 32:30.644
a fixed address, well, then
I might be able to get off.

32:31.300 --> 32:33.660
Well, I can't help
you with a job, but...

32:34.652 --> 32:39.031
Yeah... yeah, I might be able to do
something about your accommodation.

32:41.810 --> 32:43.812
I got a message you wanted to see me.

32:43.923 --> 32:45.123
What do you want?

32:45.129 --> 32:48.316
It's okay Dors. We are
gonna work everything out.

32:48.322 --> 32:49.522
What do you mean?

32:49.528 --> 32:52.466
Well, we're going to get Josh back in
here and everything's gonna be sorted.

32:52.471 --> 32:55.394
I think you'll find Nash is
about to have a change of heart.

32:55.400 --> 32:56.667
Wait, hang on...

32:57.071 --> 32:58.274
What have you done?

32:58.280 --> 33:01.194
It'll be fixed. Don't worry.

33:02.788 --> 33:04.241
Oh, no.

33:04.670 --> 33:07.655
You call if off. You
fucking call it off.

33:07.661 --> 33:11.552
- Now!
- Fuck. Fine! Jesus.

33:15.424 --> 33:16.691
What are you doin'?

33:18.706 --> 33:20.014
It's not here!

33:20.020 --> 33:22.276
- What?
- The phone is gone!

33:22.282 --> 33:23.962
I can't call if off!

33:24.165 --> 33:25.408
Fuck!

33:27.173 --> 33:28.373
Fuck!

33:28.379 --> 33:31.010
Nash! Are you okay?

33:31.016 --> 33:33.341
- Yeah, of course, babe.
- Good.

33:33.347 --> 33:35.539
Listen, take Josh and
get out of the house.

33:35.545 --> 33:39.181
- Why? What's going on?
- There's no time to explain.

33:39.187 --> 33:41.974
Just, you and Josh have
to get out of there now.

33:41.980 --> 33:45.042
- What's... okay. Okay!
- Just do it! Please!

33:53.762 --> 33:55.646
You are not gonna believe
what just happened.

34:01.851 --> 34:03.675
- Mm-hm.
- Thank you, Jake.

34:06.500 --> 34:07.700
How'd you get it?

34:07.706 --> 34:09.647
- Ahhh...
- No, seriously?

34:09.929 --> 34:12.717
Look, you don't have to worry,
it's not gonna come back on you.

34:13.039 --> 34:14.824
Let me buy you a drink after work, yeah?

34:14.831 --> 34:16.713
Yeah, right-o. If that'll
make you feel better.

34:19.339 --> 34:20.539
Whoa!

34:30.248 --> 34:32.828
Attention compound. Attention compound.

34:32.833 --> 34:36.248
All women to report to
assigned work duties.

34:38.283 --> 34:40.483
- Yeah, run away.
- I'm going.

34:40.783 --> 34:42.688
I never gave up on you.

34:43.188 --> 34:44.989
I saved your life.

34:47.389 --> 34:48.795
You were gone.

34:48.956 --> 34:50.175
You were dead.

34:50.268 --> 34:54.074
On the floor, lying in a puddle,
but I never gave up on you.

34:59.461 --> 35:00.661
Never.

35:08.742 --> 35:10.771
- Mr Jackson!
- Get to work, Smith.

35:10.777 --> 35:12.976
Come on, please! Just one minute.

35:15.046 --> 35:16.246
What?

35:16.427 --> 35:18.949
Was Allie Novak the one
that resuscitated me?

35:18.955 --> 35:20.401
I thought you couldn't
remember anything?

35:20.406 --> 35:21.606
I can't.

35:21.612 --> 35:23.925
That's why I'm asking you.
If you wanna help me remember,

35:23.931 --> 35:26.409
can you please tell me what
you saw when you found me.

35:26.549 --> 35:27.875
I took over.

35:28.667 --> 35:30.250
- From Allie?
- Mm-hm.

35:30.256 --> 35:31.980
You weren't breathing when I got there.

35:31.986 --> 35:34.782
Novak had already started resus,
she kept your heart beating.

35:36.267 --> 35:37.767
- Thank you.
- Sure.

35:51.464 --> 35:52.932
- Liz?
- Mm-hm.

35:53.630 --> 35:55.180
I need to ask you something.

35:55.186 --> 35:56.386
Yeah?

35:56.985 --> 35:58.493
That story,

35:58.790 --> 36:00.317
about the tractor,

36:00.587 --> 36:02.146
it's not true, is it?

36:02.152 --> 36:03.660
Yeah, course it is.

36:03.666 --> 36:06.261
But you didn't do it deliberately,
I mean you're not a murderer.

36:06.714 --> 36:07.914
What?

36:07.920 --> 36:09.600
I talked to the other women...

36:10.035 --> 36:12.777
they told me how upset you
were about the accident.

36:12.783 --> 36:14.606
It wan an accident, wasn't it Liz?

36:15.096 --> 36:17.804
Well, I might have
exaggerated a little bit,

36:17.810 --> 36:19.010
- you know?
- Mmm.

36:20.087 --> 36:22.002
The question is, why?

36:22.611 --> 36:25.695
Why would you tell me you
deliberately killed someone?

36:26.951 --> 36:28.522
I-I was...

36:30.138 --> 36:32.650
well... I was... just...

36:34.271 --> 36:36.273
You were showing me empathy.

36:38.119 --> 36:39.319
Yeah.

36:39.603 --> 36:42.139
Gosh, and sometimes
it's just good to talk.

36:42.145 --> 36:44.215
- I appreciate the intention.
- Mm.

36:44.221 --> 36:46.482
- It's a noble one.
- Yeah.

36:46.739 --> 36:48.232
But the thing is...

36:49.519 --> 36:51.317
I'm not a murderer either.

37:07.809 --> 37:09.096
You all right?

37:11.418 --> 37:12.618
No.

37:13.700 --> 37:16.512
Allie has gone and fucked
herself up because of me.

37:17.036 --> 37:19.341
- I mean, what am I supposed to do?
- Bea...

37:19.700 --> 37:22.942
You can change that, okay.
You can go and help her.

37:22.948 --> 37:24.249
I'm back!

37:24.255 --> 37:26.281
Oh, how'd you go, how'd you go?

37:26.286 --> 37:28.532
- Yeah, yeah. And you got it in?
- ...it was fuckin' awesome!

37:28.538 --> 37:29.750
Take it from me.

37:29.756 --> 37:32.990
If you get a second chance, you
grab it and you don't let go.

37:32.996 --> 37:34.433
Leg's up? Yeah, that brings it in...

37:34.439 --> 37:36.081
- That does it great.
- Booms,

37:36.087 --> 37:38.204
- d'you get your dinner?
- Yep.

37:42.666 --> 37:43.866
Yes.

37:45.538 --> 37:46.738
What is it, Smith?

37:48.083 --> 37:51.442
I believe that one of the
prisoners may be in harm's way.

37:51.887 --> 37:55.283
I'm requesting that she be
moved out of H3 and into my unit.

37:57.043 --> 38:00.124
Tell you, it was the best
hot dog I've ever had, eh?

38:00.130 --> 38:03.078
Hey, Lizzie told me if was
your idea, so thanks, Sonia.

38:03.084 --> 38:05.795
Hey, I might, um, yeah.

38:07.007 --> 38:08.538
- Oh.
- Thank you.

38:10.598 --> 38:12.020
Hey, listen up.

38:13.403 --> 38:15.203
Allie's taking the spare cell.

38:15.286 --> 38:17.028
- What?
- Right-o.

38:19.703 --> 38:23.438
I tell ya, this place
does my friggin' head in

38:23.444 --> 38:24.678
- sometimes.
- Uh.

38:25.803 --> 38:27.129
Okay...

38:28.100 --> 38:29.806
you got one chance at this, Allie.

38:30.210 --> 38:32.120
- I'll try.
- You won't try,

38:32.126 --> 38:33.326
you're gonna stop!

38:40.886 --> 38:42.576
It's not gonna be pretty.

38:42.582 --> 38:43.782
I know.

38:46.546 --> 38:47.746
I know.

38:57.293 --> 38:58.871
Straight through, thanks.

39:00.341 --> 39:01.541
Hey.

39:01.547 --> 39:02.747
Hey.

39:05.748 --> 39:06.948
Are you okay?

39:07.432 --> 39:08.742
I'm fine, Doreen.

39:08.748 --> 39:11.177
- Josh?
- He's fine. Everyone's fine.

39:11.440 --> 39:13.597
Got 'em all out before
your mates rocked up.

39:13.603 --> 39:16.350
They're not my mates.
It was some idiot in here

39:16.357 --> 39:17.712
- that was...
- Dor...

39:17.718 --> 39:20.590
- this is not okay.
- No, no, listen, please...

39:20.739 --> 39:22.844
one of the women in here,
she was just tryin' to...

39:22.850 --> 39:24.637
Miranda's kicked me out of the house.

39:29.104 --> 39:31.369
So, you can get your own place.

39:32.008 --> 39:34.212
Somewhere we can share when I get out?

39:34.218 --> 39:36.194
I can't find a job...

39:36.592 --> 39:39.498
and now we have nowhere to live.

39:42.066 --> 39:43.836
I'm taking Josh to Perth.

39:45.654 --> 39:47.499
Mum and Dad said they'd put us up,

39:47.636 --> 39:50.650
my cousin's got a job for me
in his panel beating business...

39:50.656 --> 39:52.149
But I'm stuck here.

39:53.018 --> 39:56.128
Even when I get parole, I
won't be allowed to travel.

39:56.346 --> 39:58.045
I can't do it all on my own.

39:58.051 --> 39:59.880
But I'll never see him,

40:00.027 --> 40:01.554
or you!

40:01.840 --> 40:04.278
No, don't, don't do this, Nash.

40:04.284 --> 40:07.087
- We'll find another way.
- I'm sorry, Dor...

40:08.023 --> 40:09.461
but right now,

40:09.729 --> 40:11.336
this is the best that I can do.

40:16.358 --> 40:17.558
Nash?

40:17.564 --> 40:19.551
Hey, hey, Nash!

40:30.496 --> 40:32.984
- Franky, Shayne Butler.
- Hey...

40:33.197 --> 40:34.725
You read my report?

40:35.233 --> 40:38.227
I get a rather interesting
phone call from the DPP,

40:38.233 --> 40:40.530
about an application that
came from this office.

40:40.536 --> 40:42.269
I thought if I made the initial inquiry,

40:42.275 --> 40:44.121
- we could just get the ball...
- Franky!

40:45.801 --> 40:47.531
Have I stuffed it up for Shayne?

40:50.051 --> 40:52.503
They're prepared to
reconsider the charge,

40:52.509 --> 40:55.011
as long as I go and talk to them now.

40:55.956 --> 40:58.268
We're looking at a
non-custodial sentence.

41:00.222 --> 41:01.690
Well, that's good enough.

41:01.696 --> 41:03.114
Wait!

41:04.814 --> 41:11.790
Franky, don't ever put in an
application without my permission again!

41:13.776 --> 41:14.976
Okay.

41:15.065 --> 41:17.559
It's been a rough road
for you to get here.

41:17.565 --> 41:20.635
Don't screw it up for
the sake of one kid!

41:22.331 --> 41:23.734
He's a good kid.

41:23.925 --> 41:26.151
And they're the ones
that break your heart.

41:30.891 --> 41:33.013
- Heya, Franky!
- Hey.

41:33.704 --> 41:36.311
- You want me, don't ya?
- You wish!

41:40.433 --> 41:42.203
So, I got some good news for you...

41:42.209 --> 41:44.765
Hey, you want a drink? I found
some vodka in the freezer.

41:44.771 --> 41:47.441
Ooh, not for me thanks, and
I don't think for you either.

41:47.447 --> 41:50.011
Yeah, you're right. Better not.

41:50.764 --> 41:52.167
So, you get me off?

41:52.863 --> 41:55.901
Ah, not totally, but they've
given you a lesser charge.

41:56.067 --> 41:57.267
Like what?

41:58.733 --> 42:01.379
Shayne, who's place is this?

42:01.385 --> 42:02.855
It's okay, it's a freebie.

42:03.716 --> 42:07.044
My godmother, Joan. She said I
can stay here whenever I want.

42:20.891 --> 42:22.091
Hey?

42:22.097 --> 42:23.449
Let's go get a drink.

42:24.587 --> 42:27.523
I'd love to but I've
got something else on.

42:27.891 --> 42:29.484
Maybe tomorrow night?

42:29.779 --> 42:33.764
Yeah, um... yeah, could
whip up my famous spag bol.

42:34.405 --> 42:35.917
- Sounds delicious.
- Right.

42:37.224 --> 42:38.431
