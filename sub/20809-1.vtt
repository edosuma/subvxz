During my season,

- My name is Yekaterina
Petrovna Zamolodchikova,

00:53.788 --> 00:54.720
I feel like
I held back out of fear.

00:54.721 --> 00:55.653
- My name is Yekaterina

01:37.998 --> 01:38.597

01:58.085 --> 02:01.820
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards

02:04.374 --> 02:06.925
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards

02:06.927 --> 02:07.760
Thank the lords above.

02:07.761 --> 02:08.594
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:08.596 --> 02:10.246
I'm back, back, back,
back, back again.

02:10.247 --> 02:11.897
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:11.899 --> 02:12.331
(clicks tongue)

02:12.332 --> 02:12.764
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:12.766 --> 02:13.615
Alyssa Edwards, real miss.

02:13.616 --> 02:14.465
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:14.468 --> 02:15.601
'Cause I'm what?
Sick bitch.

02:15.602 --> 02:16.735
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards

02:16.737 --> 02:17.403
(clicks tongue)

02:17.404 --> 02:18.070
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards

02:18.789 --> 02:19.505
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards

02:19.507 --> 02:20.906

my Russia get-up on.

02:20.907 --> 02:22.306
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:22.309 --> 02:23.358
- I love that you're
wearing a cape again.

02:23.359 --> 02:24.408
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:24.411 --> 02:24.860
- You know, I didn't know

02:24.861 --> 02:25.310
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:25.312 --> 02:26.028
if I wanted to be Goldilocks
or Little Red--

02:26.029 --> 02:26.745
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:26.747 --> 02:27.129
- Red Riding Ho.

02:27.130 --> 02:27.512
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:27.515 --> 02:28.647
Alyssa Edwards,
she looks like just she did

02:28.648 --> 02:29.780
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:29.783 --> 02:30.282
when she walked
in Season 5,

02:30.283 --> 02:30.782
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:30.784 --> 02:32.518
just with a little better hair
and slightly less rolls.

02:32.519 --> 02:34.253
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:34.255 --> 02:34.670
(laughs)

02:34.671 --> 02:35.086
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:35.089 --> 02:35.488
- Girl, look at us.

02:35.489 --> 02:35.888
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:35.890 --> 02:36.405
- Get up in the mirror,
girl.

02:36.406 --> 02:36.921
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:36.924 --> 02:38.207
- This is a really good
picture. Okay, okay.

02:38.208 --> 02:39.491
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:39.493 --> 02:40.759
- You cannot have
a conversation with Alyssa

02:40.760 --> 02:42.026
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:42.029 --> 02:42.911
if you're in proximity
to a mirror.

02:42.912 --> 02:43.794
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:43.797 --> 02:45.781
And even if, like, Ed McMahon
had risen from the dead,

02:45.782 --> 02:47.766
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:47.768 --> 02:49.118
presenting her with
a $300,000 check,

02:49.119 --> 02:50.469
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:50.471 --> 02:51.403
she'd be...
(slurping)

02:51.404 --> 02:52.336
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:52.339 --> 02:52.738
One second, one second.

02:52.739 --> 02:53.138
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:53.140 --> 02:54.823
- It's nice to see that
they regrouted the brick.

02:54.824 --> 02:56.507
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:56.510 --> 02:57.810
And, no, I was not talking
about you that time.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.111
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

02:59.113 --> 03:00.262
- Oh, she already started,
girl.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.412
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

03:01.415 --> 03:04.033
The shade is knee deep
already, girl, day one.

03:04.034 --> 03:06.652
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

03:06.654 --> 03:07.570
- (laughs)

03:07.571 --> 03:08.487
Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards
representing Season 5,

03:11.225 --> 03:12.925
- Ooh.

03:12.927 --> 03:14.210
- Riddle me this,
riddle me that,

03:14.211 --> 03:15.494
- Ooh.

03:15.496 --> 03:16.645
watch out, girls,
this bitch is back.

03:16.646 --> 03:17.795
- Ooh.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.015
I'm Phi Phi O'Hara
and I'm playing a villain.

03:20.016 --> 03:22.233
- Ooh.

03:22.236 --> 03:22.768
Get it?

03:22.769 --> 03:23.301
- Ooh.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.553
I mean, I'll start
where I left off.

03:24.554 --> 03:25.803
- Ooh.

03:25.806 --> 03:26.972
- You look good.
- Thank you, I showered.

03:26.973 --> 03:28.139
- Ooh.

03:28.142 --> 03:28.524
- Bitch.
- Hey.

03:28.525 --> 03:28.907
- Ooh.

03:28.909 --> 03:29.625
Last time, I had
a lot of built up anger

03:29.626 --> 03:30.342
- Ooh.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.961
and stuff in me and I didn't
know how handle situations.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.579
- Ooh.

03:33.581 --> 03:33.979
Tired ass show girl.

03:33.980 --> 03:34.378
- Ooh.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.080
- At least I am a showgirl,
bitch.

03:35.081 --> 03:35.780
- Ooh.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.266
Go back to Party City
where you belong.

03:37.267 --> 03:38.750
- Ooh.

03:39.486 --> 03:40.586
- After my season,

03:40.588 --> 03:41.303
a lot of people
had this perception of me,

03:41.304 --> 03:42.019
- After my season,

03:42.022 --> 03:42.671
so it was hard
to get bookings.

03:42.672 --> 03:43.321
- After my season,

03:43.324 --> 03:44.190
People genuinely thought
I would come

03:44.191 --> 03:45.057
- After my season,

03:45.059 --> 03:45.958
and, like,
blow their club up.

03:45.959 --> 03:46.858
- After my season,

03:46.860 --> 03:47.326
So it took a lot of work

03:47.327 --> 03:47.793
- After my season,

03:47.795 --> 03:48.394
to show people
that I'm professional.

03:48.395 --> 03:48.994
- After my season,

03:48.996 --> 03:50.713
I'm just really worried about
kicking your ass off the show.

03:50.714 --> 03:52.431
- After my season,

03:52.433 --> 03:53.148
(all laugh)

03:53.149 --> 03:53.864
- After my season,

03:53.867 --> 03:54.483
No, no,
I've changed my ways.

03:54.484 --> 03:55.100
- After my season,

03:55.102 --> 03:55.968
No sabotaging this time.

03:55.969 --> 03:56.835
- After my season,

03:56.837 --> 03:57.236
My drag has changed.

03:57.237 --> 03:57.636
- After my season,

03:57.638 --> 03:58.487
My makeup has changed.
I stopped tanning.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.337
- After my season,

03:59.340 --> 04:01.207
I want the world to see
that I have changed.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.075
- After my season,

04:03.077 --> 04:04.326
(clears throat)

04:04.327 --> 04:05.576
- After my season,

04:05.579 --> 04:06.662
- Whoo!

04:06.663 --> 04:07.746
- After my season,

04:07.748 --> 04:10.516
- Come on, all-stars,
let's get...this over with.

04:10.517 --> 04:13.285
- After my season,

04:13.287 --> 04:13.652
(all laugh)

04:13.653 --> 04:14.018
- After my season,

04:14.021 --> 04:15.838
Ribbit, ribbit, the glamour
toad is in the building.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.656
- After my season,

04:17.658 --> 04:18.774
- Where in England
are you from, Adele?

04:18.775 --> 04:19.891
- After my season,

04:19.893 --> 04:20.392
- My house.

04:20.393 --> 04:20.892
- After my season,

04:20.894 --> 04:21.910
I flood my basement, bitch.

04:21.911 --> 04:22.927
- After my season,

04:22.930 --> 04:23.529
Aah!

04:23.530 --> 04:24.129
- After my season,

04:24.131 --> 04:25.297
Ginger Minj is back
with a vengeance, baby.

04:25.298 --> 04:26.464
- After my season,

04:26.467 --> 04:27.349
It's a whole new me.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.232
- After my season,

04:28.235 --> 04:29.017
- Aah!
- Aah!

04:29.018 --> 04:29.800
- After my season,

04:29.803 --> 04:31.203
- You better pose,
bathing suit competition.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.604
- After my season,

04:32.606 --> 04:34.056
- Oh, my God, it's good
to see you, diarrhea.

04:34.057 --> 04:35.507
- After my season,

04:35.509 --> 04:36.508
Season 7
got a lot of hate

04:36.509 --> 04:37.508
- After my season,

04:37.511 --> 04:38.560
for being a lackluster
bunch of girls,

04:38.561 --> 04:39.610
- After my season,

04:39.613 --> 04:40.946
so I am here to say,
now, Miss Thang,

04:40.947 --> 04:42.280
- After my season,

04:42.283 --> 04:43.432
we are just as talented
and worthy

04:43.433 --> 04:44.582
- After my season,

04:44.585 --> 04:45.067
as the rest of these girls.

04:45.068 --> 04:45.550
- After my season,

04:45.552 --> 04:47.736
You look so much better with
half of your face covered.

04:47.737 --> 04:49.921
- After my season,

04:49.923 --> 04:50.889
Oh, wait, I'm supposed
to be nice this time.

04:50.890 --> 04:51.856
- After my season,

04:51.859 --> 04:53.692
Everyone looks so beautiful.

04:53.693 --> 04:55.526
- After my season,

04:55.529 --> 04:56.044
I'm wearing a corset,
though.

04:56.045 --> 04:56.560
- After my season,

04:56.563 --> 04:58.013
Apparently, all it takes to win
is a corset, so I bought one.

04:58.014 --> 04:59.464
- After my season,

04:59.466 --> 05:00.382
- Oh.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.299
- After my season,

05:01.302 --> 05:02.168
- We'll edit that out.
- Ooh.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.035
- After my season,

05:03.037 --> 05:03.769
- Will they, though?
Will they?

05:03.770 --> 05:04.502
- After my season,

05:04.505 --> 05:05.704
- No, they will not.

05:05.705 --> 05:06.904
- After my season,

05:07.574 --> 05:10.175
- Thick and juicy's back,
bitches.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.126
- Oh!
- Oh!

05:11.127 --> 05:12.076
- Thick and juicy's back,
bitches.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.162
- My name is Roxxxy Andrews,
and I still rep

05:13.163 --> 05:14.246
- Thick and juicy's back,
bitches.

05:14.248 --> 05:14.813
for the girls
who are thick and juicy

05:14.814 --> 05:15.379
- Thick and juicy's back,
bitches.

05:15.382 --> 05:15.964
'cause even though
I lost weight,

05:15.965 --> 05:16.547
- Thick and juicy's back,
bitches.

05:16.550 --> 05:17.049
I'm always thick and juicy.

05:17.050 --> 05:17.549
- Thick and juicy's back,
bitches.

05:17.551 --> 05:18.634
I don't care if I'm 300 pounds
or 200 pounds,

05:18.635 --> 05:19.718
- Thick and juicy's back,
bitches.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.719
thick and juicy
is Roxxxy Andrews.

05:20.720 --> 05:21.719
- Thick and juicy's back,
bitches.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.073
I'm so excited
to be here today.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.425
- Thick and juicy's back,
bitches.

05:27.394 --> 05:29.194
- All that ass. Bam!

05:29.196 --> 05:30.596
- So what has been
your favorite moment

05:30.597 --> 05:31.997
- All that ass. Bam!

05:31.999 --> 05:32.865
throughout this competition?

05:32.866 --> 05:33.732
- All that ass. Bam!

05:33.734 --> 05:34.783
- Seeing you
in the bottom two.

05:34.784 --> 05:35.833
- All that ass. Bam!

05:35.836 --> 05:36.568
On Season 5,

05:36.569 --> 05:37.301
- All that ass. Bam!

05:37.304 --> 05:38.337
I let the competition
get the best of me,

05:38.338 --> 05:39.371
- All that ass. Bam!

05:39.373 --> 05:40.255
and I was playing messy.

05:40.256 --> 05:41.138
- All that ass. Bam!

05:41.141 --> 05:41.873
So I have a lot to prove.

05:41.874 --> 05:42.606
- All that ass. Bam!

05:42.609 --> 05:43.959
I can compete and win
because I deserve it

05:43.960 --> 05:45.310
- All that ass. Bam!

05:45.312 --> 05:46.144
and not because
I'm knocking people out

05:46.145 --> 05:46.977
- All that ass. Bam!

05:46.980 --> 05:47.913
by playing mind games.

05:47.914 --> 05:48.847
- All that ass. Bam!

05:48.849 --> 05:49.398
- Oh, yes, bitch!

05:49.399 --> 05:49.948
- All that ass. Bam!

05:49.950 --> 05:51.200
- Oh, my God,
my baby Roxxxy's here.

05:51.201 --> 05:52.451
- All that ass. Bam!

05:52.453 --> 05:53.168
- Not the Rotox.

05:53.169 --> 05:53.884
- All that ass. Bam!

05:53.887 --> 05:54.403
- When I saw Detox,

05:54.404 --> 05:54.920
- All that ass. Bam!

05:54.922 --> 05:56.472
I was like, bitch,
we get to do this again.

05:56.473 --> 05:58.023
- All that ass. Bam!

05:58.025 --> 05:58.357
That's my girl.

05:58.358 --> 05:58.690
- All that ass. Bam!

05:58.692 --> 05:59.458
- There's a lot of you
Season 5s here.

05:59.459 --> 06:00.225
- All that ass. Bam!

06:00.227 --> 06:01.660
- That's funny, because
I think 4 put it on the map.

06:01.661 --> 06:03.094
- All that ass. Bam!

06:03.097 --> 06:04.163
- Oh. (laughs)

06:04.164 --> 06:05.230
- All that ass. Bam!

06:06.266 --> 06:08.867
- Okay.
(all laugh)

06:09.636 --> 06:10.602
- Oh, no, ma'am.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.871
- Orange you girls
happy to see me?

06:12.872 --> 06:15.139
- Oh, no, ma'am.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.046
- The face crack
of the century.

06:24.284 --> 06:26.651
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

06:26.653 --> 06:27.352
- Yeah!
(all laugh)

06:27.353 --> 06:28.052
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.471
- Girl, we had
buried the hatch.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.888
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

06:30.891 --> 06:31.824
We put it in the ground
12 feet under.

06:31.825 --> 06:32.758
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.926
She ain't coming back out,
okay?

06:33.927 --> 06:35.093
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

06:35.095 --> 06:35.961
- Come on, Season 5.

06:35.962 --> 06:36.828
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

06:36.830 --> 06:37.613
- Yes!

06:37.614 --> 06:38.397
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

06:38.399 --> 06:38.864
- I am Coco Montrese.

06:38.865 --> 06:39.330
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

06:39.333 --> 06:40.883
I was the lip-synch diva
of Season 5.

06:40.884 --> 06:42.434
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.353
- Girl, you look like
the black PeeWee Herman.

06:44.354 --> 06:46.271
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

06:46.273 --> 06:46.588
(laughter)

06:46.589 --> 06:46.904
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.040
- Girl, look how orange
you fucking look.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.174
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.425
- I'm not joking, bitch.

06:50.426 --> 06:51.675
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

06:51.678 --> 06:52.494
(all laugh)

06:52.495 --> 06:53.311
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

06:53.313 --> 06:54.179
- Girl, you got
some Dorito fantasy?

06:54.180 --> 06:55.046
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

06:55.048 --> 06:55.897
- Yes, girl.
- Let me see.

06:55.898 --> 06:56.747
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.482
- Look how orange I look.

06:57.483 --> 06:58.215
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.151
- I'm not joking, bitch.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.085
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.036
- Girl, you're covering
your face in that hat.

07:01.037 --> 07:01.986
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.439
Show them that pretty skin.
It ain't that orange.

07:03.440 --> 07:04.890
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.325
- Girl, that's
custom couture made.

07:06.326 --> 07:07.759
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

07:07.761 --> 07:08.393
- In a garage.

07:08.394 --> 07:09.026
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.045
- Some girls
don't change their makeup.

07:10.046 --> 07:11.062
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.314
It's the same black eye shadow
and the same lipstick.

07:12.315 --> 07:13.565
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.901
I am not gonna say no names,
Roxxxy Andrews.

07:15.902 --> 07:18.236
- Bitch, that was so
three years ago.

07:20.707 --> 07:21.473
- Greetings.

07:21.475 --> 07:24.493
My message for the human race
is really quite simple.

07:24.494 --> 07:27.512
- Greetings.

07:27.514 --> 07:28.380
Hi-ee. Hi-ee.

07:28.381 --> 07:29.247
- Greetings.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.248
- Whoo!
- Hi.

07:30.249 --> 07:31.248
- Greetings.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.234
- I think I was chosen
as an all-star

07:32.235 --> 07:33.218
- Greetings.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.454
because nobody can do
Alaska except Alaska.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.689
- Greetings.

07:37.691 --> 07:38.523
But I encourage you to try.

07:38.524 --> 07:39.356
- Greetings.

07:39.359 --> 07:39.674
It's fun.

07:39.675 --> 07:39.990
- Greetings.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.476
- Aah!
- I just wrote anus.

07:41.477 --> 07:42.960
- Greetings.

07:42.963 --> 07:43.812
Little poundcake enjoys

07:43.813 --> 07:44.662
- Greetings.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.432
being a straight up
mother-fucking pig.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.200
- Greetings.

07:48.202 --> 07:48.534
(all laugh)

07:48.535 --> 07:48.867
- Greetings.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.118
I will stand out from
the rest of these queens

07:50.119 --> 07:51.368
- Greetings.

07:51.371 --> 07:54.206
because I am more "all"
and I'm more "star" like.

07:54.207 --> 07:57.042
- Greetings.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.144
Star-ish. Star-esque.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.245
- Greetings.

08:02.249 --> 08:02.948
- Mwah, mwah.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.283
- I just came
from Party City.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.617
- Mwah, mwah.

08:05.619 --> 08:06.785
I'm the groupon girl.

08:06.786 --> 08:07.952
- Mwah, mwah.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.021
- Don't we look pretty?
- Yeah.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.088
- Mwah, mwah.

08:10.090 --> 08:10.956
- Five from 5.
- Oh, girl.

08:10.957 --> 08:11.823
- Mwah, mwah.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.175
- Yeah, five from 5.
- Season 5 all over.

08:13.176 --> 08:14.526
- Mwah, mwah.

08:14.528 --> 08:15.511
Last time I was here,

08:15.512 --> 08:16.495
- Mwah, mwah.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.113
I was concerned
about my relationship

08:18.114 --> 08:19.730
- Mwah, mwah.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.283
and how people
were perceiving me.

08:21.284 --> 08:22.834
- Mwah, mwah.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.952
And now, it's just me,

08:23.953 --> 08:25.069
- Mwah, mwah.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.805
and I'm focused
and galvanized

08:26.806 --> 08:28.539
- Mwah, mwah.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.409
and ready to take the crown.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.277
- Mwah, mwah.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.081
- Aah!
- Thank you.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.382
- Morgan McMichaels
walks into the--

08:37.383 --> 08:38.682
- Aah!
- Thank you.

08:38.685 --> 08:39.634
Wait, that's not Morgan?

08:39.635 --> 08:40.584
- Aah!
- Thank you.

08:42.389 --> 08:43.421
- My name's Tatianna.

08:43.423 --> 08:44.506
I placed fourth on Season 2

08:44.507 --> 08:45.590
- My name's Tatianna.

08:45.592 --> 08:46.091
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

08:46.092 --> 08:46.591
- My name's Tatianna.

08:46.593 --> 08:47.559
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

08:47.560 --> 08:48.526
- My name's Tatianna.

08:48.529 --> 08:49.695
The suspense
is boring me to pieces.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.862
- My name's Tatianna.

08:50.864 --> 08:51.847
Tyra is a complete bitch.

08:51.848 --> 08:52.831
- My name's Tatianna.

08:54.601 --> 08:55.901
What's up, hookers?

08:55.903 --> 08:57.035
- Hey, bitch.
- Kylie Jenner.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.168
What's up, hookers?

08:58.171 --> 08:59.170
- She is beat.

08:59.171 --> 09:00.170
What's up, hookers?

09:00.173 --> 09:00.622
- I think the other queens

09:00.623 --> 09:01.072
What's up, hookers?

09:01.074 --> 09:02.090
are thinking,
all this is really right.

09:02.091 --> 09:03.107
What's up, hookers?

09:03.110 --> 09:04.977
- Girl, how excited are you
to be back up in this gig?

09:04.978 --> 09:06.845
What's up, hookers?

09:06.847 --> 09:07.362
- I'm so ready.

09:07.363 --> 09:07.878
What's up, hookers?

09:07.881 --> 09:08.413
- You're the only 2 here.

09:08.414 --> 09:08.946
What's up, hookers?

09:08.949 --> 09:09.715
Tatianna might be
the weakest link

09:09.716 --> 09:10.482
What's up, hookers?

09:10.484 --> 09:12.251
only because she's kind of
like the old school.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.019
What's up, hookers?

09:14.021 --> 09:15.187
She's from the old batch of,
you know, "Drag Race"

09:15.188 --> 09:16.354
What's up, hookers?

09:16.356 --> 09:17.589
and "Drag" has changed
so much since her season.

09:17.590 --> 09:18.823
What's up, hookers?

09:18.825 --> 09:20.542
- Come on, Season 2.
Let's get sexy!

09:20.543 --> 09:22.260
What's up, hookers?

09:22.262 --> 09:23.261
- Come on through, Season 2.

09:23.262 --> 09:24.261
What's up, hookers?

09:24.264 --> 09:25.013

10:25.558 --> 10:26.824
Yeah.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.443
My drag sell today
is a bit controversial.

10:28.444 --> 10:30.060
Yeah.

10:30.063 --> 10:30.879
I'm inspired by
the grunge movement,

10:30.880 --> 10:31.696
Yeah.

10:31.698 --> 10:32.547
the riot girl movement
of the nineties,

10:32.548 --> 10:33.397
Yeah.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.149
but a lot of people
don't get that.

10:34.150 --> 10:34.899
Yeah.

10:34.901 --> 10:36.217
They'd like to say that
I'm lazy about my drag,

10:36.218 --> 10:37.534
Yeah.

10:37.537 --> 10:38.320
but I love being
a nonconformist.

10:38.321 --> 10:39.104
Yeah.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.956
I mean, I can't crowd surf
in a corset.

10:40.957 --> 10:42.807
Yeah.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.065
I have to ask the question.

11:07.066 --> 11:08.632
Yeah.

11:08.635 --> 11:10.702
Who deserves to go home
tonight and why?

11:10.703 --> 11:12.770
Yeah.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.940
What, too soon?

11:15.942 --> 11:17.325
(laughs)

11:17.326 --> 11:18.709
What, too soon?

11:19.112 --> 11:21.913

11:28.004 --> 11:29.454
- Hello, hello, hello.

11:29.456 --> 11:30.272
I can't believe
you're back.

11:30.273 --> 11:31.089
- Hello, hello, hello.

11:31.091 --> 11:31.740
No, really,
I can't believe you're back.

11:31.741 --> 11:32.390
- Hello, hello, hello.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.376
I thought the restraining order
was still in effect.

11:36.363 --> 11:36.745
Hey, famous thang.

11:36.746 --> 11:37.128

11:40.033 --> 11:41.132
I could have invited back.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.232
- Hello, hello, hello.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.501
But you 10 were chosen

11:43.502 --> 11:44.768
- Hello, hello, hello.

11:44.771 --> 11:45.820
because I believe
that each of you

11:46.873 --> 11:48.023

14:43.265 --> 14:44.381
- Alyssa, you are like
the Abby Lee Miller of drag.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.383

her back rolls.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.383

20:03.269 --> 20:04.502
- It's like I never left.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.888
Rolaskatox is Roxxxy,
Alaska and Detox.

20:06.889 --> 20:09.273
- It's like I never left.

20:09.275 --> 20:09.857
Rolaskatox.

20:09.858 --> 20:10.440
- It's like I never left.

20:10.443 --> 20:11.376
She's moved on from us.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.310
- It's like I never left.

20:12.312 --> 20:12.710
The Rotox show.

20:12.711 --> 20:13.109
- It's like I never left.

20:13.112 --> 20:15.997
- The original parts
of Rolaskatox are here,

20:15.998 --> 20:18.883
- It's like I never left.

20:18.885 --> 20:19.717
however, that does not mean

20:19.718 --> 20:20.550
- It's like I never left.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.270
the band
is getting back together.

20:22.271 --> 20:23.988
- It's like I never left.

20:25.391 --> 20:28.259
- What are you doing
for your talent show?

20:28.261 --> 20:28.593
Are you dancing?

20:28.594 --> 20:28.926
- What are you doing
for your talent show?

20:28.928 --> 20:30.244
- I'm gonna do, like,
a little gymnastics routine.

20:30.245 --> 20:31.561
- What are you doing
for your talent show?

20:31.564 --> 20:31.863
- Work!

20:31.864 --> 20:32.163
- What are you doing
for your talent show?

20:32.165 --> 20:33.431
- What are you doing?
- I'm a singer/songwriter,

20:33.432 --> 20:34.698
- What are you doing
for your talent show?

20:34.701 --> 20:35.800
so I'm gonna sing a song
that I wrote.

20:35.801 --> 20:36.900
- What are you doing
for your talent show?

20:36.903 --> 20:37.368
- What song are you singing?

20:37.369 --> 20:37.834
- What are you doing
for your talent show?

20:37.837 --> 20:39.103
- Well, I'm actually singing
a cappella.

20:39.104 --> 20:40.370
- What are you doing
for your talent show?

20:42.542 --> 20:44.275
- A cappella.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.093
Girl, I've been singing
my whole life,

20:45.094 --> 20:45.910
- A cappella.

20:45.912 --> 20:46.945
and I don't sing a cappella.

20:46.946 --> 20:47.979
- A cappella.

20:47.981 --> 20:48.880
If you go off your tempo,

20:48.881 --> 20:49.780
- A cappella.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.582
your timing, your anything,
you are fuck.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.383
- A cappella.

20:53.386 --> 20:53.968
- I know it's pretty ballsy,

20:53.969 --> 20:54.551
- A cappella.

20:54.554 --> 20:55.236
but, like, I hope
that it shows

20:55.237 --> 20:55.919
- A cappella.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.221
that I'm a real singer
tomorrow without any music.

20:57.222 --> 20:58.521
- A cappella.

20:58.524 --> 20:59.006
- You do what you do

20:59.007 --> 20:59.489
- A cappella.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.792
and your fucking
tells us if you work hard.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.093
- A cappella.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.998
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.049
Very subtle, you know.

21:08.050 --> 21:09.099
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:09.102 --> 21:09.968
- I brought fan underwear.

21:09.969 --> 21:10.835
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:10.837 --> 21:11.219
- Fan underwear?

21:11.220 --> 21:11.602
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.553
Like, underwear
a fan gave you?

21:12.554 --> 21:13.503
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:13.506 --> 21:13.921
- Yeah, on the stage.

21:13.922 --> 21:14.337
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.190
- People give you
their underwear on stage?

21:16.191 --> 21:18.041
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:18.044 --> 21:18.326
- Yes.

21:18.327 --> 21:18.609
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:18.611 --> 21:19.177
- Those have always
brought me luck.

21:19.178 --> 21:19.744
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:19.746 --> 21:20.895
- You're like Tom Jones,
basically.

21:20.896 --> 21:22.045
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.164
- I'm like David Cassidy.
Look.

21:23.165 --> 21:24.281
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.667
- (laughs)
- America's sweetheart.

21:25.668 --> 21:27.051
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:27.053 --> 21:28.770
My biggest competition
in this talent show

21:28.771 --> 21:30.488
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:30.490 --> 21:31.506
I think
is going to be Adore.

21:31.507 --> 21:32.523
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:32.525 --> 21:33.074
She's got a great voice.

21:33.075 --> 21:33.624
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:33.626 --> 21:36.010
- ¶ When you love me ¶

21:36.011 --> 21:38.395
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:38.398 --> 21:39.747
- This is something that
she's gonna do very, very well,

21:39.748 --> 21:41.097
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.767
and it scares me a little bit
because right now,

21:42.768 --> 21:44.435
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.119
you want to be on that top.

21:45.120 --> 21:45.802
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:45.805 --> 21:46.487
You want that $10,000

21:46.488 --> 21:47.170
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:47.173 --> 21:48.689
and you want to show the judges
that you're an all-star.

21:48.690 --> 21:50.206
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:50.209 --> 21:50.891
You deserve to win this.

21:50.892 --> 21:51.574
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:51.577 --> 21:52.576
So let's get this done.

21:52.577 --> 21:53.576
- Nothing like a sensible
tank top with rhinestones.

21:54.514 --> 21:55.513

22:14.067 --> 22:16.184
- We are here.
H-E-R-E, here.

22:16.185 --> 22:18.302
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:18.304 --> 22:19.854
- Time to get ready for the "All
Star" talent show extravaganza.

22:19.855 --> 22:21.405
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:21.407 --> 22:22.840
I haven't done a talent show
since, like, third grade.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.274
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:24.277 --> 22:24.842
I sang Selena.

22:24.843 --> 22:25.408
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:25.411 --> 22:26.193
(laughs)

22:26.194 --> 22:26.976
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:26.979 --> 22:27.778
- I'm just really nervous.

22:27.779 --> 22:28.578
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:28.581 --> 22:29.614
I feel like
it's too good to be true,

22:29.615 --> 22:30.648
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:30.650 --> 22:31.482
and I feel like
people are going home.

22:31.483 --> 22:32.315
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:32.318 --> 22:34.919
RuPaul said that he's not
eliminating anyone this season,

22:34.920 --> 22:37.521
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:37.523 --> 22:40.174
but I think we're all just sort
of feeling an impending doom.

22:40.175 --> 22:42.826
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:42.829 --> 22:44.329
What's the twist?
What's coming?

22:44.330 --> 22:45.830
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:45.832 --> 22:46.648
I'm scared.

22:46.649 --> 22:47.465
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:49.535 --> 22:53.070
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

22:53.072 --> 22:54.689
- I feel like I want to show
everyone where I'm at now.

22:54.690 --> 22:56.307
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

22:56.309 --> 22:57.358
- It's been a while.
- It's been a minute.

22:57.359 --> 22:58.408
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

22:58.411 --> 22:59.627
I have figured
a lot of things out.

22:59.628 --> 23:00.844
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:00.847 --> 23:01.212
- Like what?

23:01.213 --> 23:01.578
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:01.581 --> 23:02.380
- Like to not shop
at Wet Seal

23:02.381 --> 23:03.180
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:03.182 --> 23:04.415
when you're gonna come
to "RuPaul's Drag Race."

23:04.416 --> 23:05.649
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:05.651 --> 23:06.934
- (laughs)
But it was different.

23:06.935 --> 23:08.218
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:08.221 --> 23:09.454
Like, it was sort of
more like ready-to-wear

23:09.455 --> 23:10.688
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:10.690 --> 23:12.223
and over time,
the show has evolved.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.757
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:13.760 --> 23:14.192
- Yeah.
- You know.

23:14.193 --> 23:14.625
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:14.627 --> 23:15.142
- I came back
'cause I think--

23:15.143 --> 23:15.658
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:15.661 --> 23:16.260
I mean, I have
a whole lot to prove.

23:16.261 --> 23:16.860
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:16.863 --> 23:17.795
I have
a whole public audience

23:17.796 --> 23:18.728
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:18.731 --> 23:19.297
that thinks
I'm a certain way,

23:19.298 --> 23:19.864
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:19.866 --> 23:20.765
and I don't want them
to think I'm that way.

23:20.766 --> 23:21.665
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:21.667 --> 23:23.150
- Oh, you mean everyone
thinking you're a bitch?

23:23.151 --> 23:24.634
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:24.637 --> 23:24.986
- Oh, ooh.

23:24.987 --> 23:25.336
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:25.338 --> 23:26.220
- I do have a bitchy side
and that's an honest side.

23:26.221 --> 23:27.103
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:27.106 --> 23:27.822
I just want them to know
there's more to me

23:27.823 --> 23:28.539
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:28.541 --> 23:30.274
than just some angry
little orange monster.

23:30.275 --> 23:32.008
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:32.011 --> 23:32.393
- Ha!

23:32.394 --> 23:32.776
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:32.779 --> 23:33.211
- I was super embarrassed

23:33.212 --> 23:33.644
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:33.646 --> 23:35.012
about how I was behaving
and acting on Season 4.

23:35.013 --> 23:36.379
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:36.382 --> 23:37.698
I do have a lot to prove,
especially to the audience.

23:37.699 --> 23:39.015
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:39.018 --> 23:40.668
And at the same time, my drag
style has completely changed.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.319
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:42.321 --> 23:43.938
Now I do a lot of cosplay,
and it's really cool and fun.

23:43.939 --> 23:45.556
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:45.558 --> 23:46.340
I'm not just
this tired ass showgirl.

23:46.341 --> 23:47.123
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:47.126 --> 23:48.826
There is a star in Phi Phi,
and she's ready to shine.

23:48.827 --> 23:50.527
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:50.530 --> 23:51.212
This is like
a family reunion to me.

23:51.213 --> 23:51.895
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:51.898 --> 23:53.164
This is fun. Like, how are we
gonna fight and stuff?

23:53.165 --> 23:54.431
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:54.434 --> 23:55.216
- I'm sure
you'll find a way.

23:55.217 --> 23:55.999
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

23:56.002 --> 23:57.018

come back for "All Stars?"

23:58.037 --> 23:59.287

So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

24:00.540 --> 24:00.905
(all laugh)

24:00.906 --> 24:01.271
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

24:01.274 --> 24:03.024
- Don't be shady.
Be a lady.

24:03.025 --> 24:04.775
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

24:04.777 --> 24:05.509
- I was a bitch on Season 5.

24:05.510 --> 24:06.242
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

24:06.245 --> 24:06.911
This isn't a joke to me.
- I don't think it's--

24:06.912 --> 24:07.578
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

24:07.580 --> 24:08.529
- This competition
is extremely serious.

24:08.530 --> 24:09.479
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

24:09.482 --> 24:10.882
You're Jinkx Monsoon
playing a character.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.283
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

24:12.285 --> 24:13.551
A lot of girls
want to blame editing,

24:13.552 --> 24:14.818
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

24:14.821 --> 24:15.320
and I'm not that girl.

24:15.321 --> 24:15.820
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

24:15.822 --> 24:17.071
I said the things I did.
I played those mind games.

24:17.072 --> 24:18.321
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

24:18.324 --> 24:19.991
Anything on this TV show
that is said, you said it.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.659
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

24:21.661 --> 24:22.543
I let the competition
get to me.

24:22.544 --> 24:23.426
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

24:23.429 --> 24:24.562
I was playing dirty
and at the time,

24:24.563 --> 24:25.696
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

24:25.698 --> 24:26.614
Jinkx,
I'm so close to the crown

24:26.615 --> 24:27.531
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

24:27.533 --> 24:28.249
that how
am I gonna get her?

24:28.250 --> 24:28.966
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

24:28.968 --> 24:29.700
I'm obviously
not as funny as she is.

24:29.701 --> 24:30.433
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

24:30.436 --> 24:32.019
I'm obviously
not as smart as she is

24:32.020 --> 24:33.603
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

24:33.606 --> 24:34.589
and I have to do something.

24:34.590 --> 24:35.573
So why did you two decide to
come back for "All Stars?"

24:37.210 --> 24:39.944
And my stupid self said...

24:41.547 --> 24:45.683
I've learned from my mistakes
and I changed my attitude

24:45.685 --> 24:46.534
and there's no way that
that can happen again.

24:46.535 --> 24:47.384
I've learned from my mistakes
and I changed my attitude

24:47.386 --> 24:48.285
I don't want to be
that girl.

24:48.286 --> 24:49.185
I've learned from my mistakes
and I changed my attitude

24:49.188 --> 24:50.204
I mean, I won't be.

24:50.205 --> 24:51.221
I've learned from my mistakes
and I changed my attitude

24:51.224 --> 24:51.556
I refuse.

24:51.557 --> 24:51.889
I've learned from my mistakes
and I changed my attitude

24:51.891 --> 24:53.074
This is our second chance.
Redemption, honey.

24:53.075 --> 24:54.258
I've learned from my mistakes
and I changed my attitude

24:54.260 --> 24:54.859
- ¶ Can I get an amen? ¶

24:54.860 --> 24:55.459
I've learned from my mistakes
and I changed my attitude

24:55.461 --> 24:56.227
- ¶ Can I get an amen? ¶

24:56.228 --> 24:56.994
I've learned from my mistakes
and I changed my attitude

24:56.996 --> 24:58.579
- Some of the girls
might be more focused

24:58.580 --> 25:00.163
I've learned from my mistakes
and I changed my attitude

25:00.166 --> 25:01.148
on rehabilitating
their reputation

25:01.149 --> 25:02.131
I've learned from my mistakes
and I changed my attitude

25:02.134 --> 25:03.250
rather than just
winning the competition.

25:03.251 --> 25:04.367
I've learned from my mistakes
and I changed my attitude

25:04.370 --> 25:05.119
But I'm here
to show the world

25:05.120 --> 25:05.869
I've learned from my mistakes
and I changed my attitude

25:05.872 --> 25:08.005
that I've turned into
a total fucking monster.

25:08.006 --> 25:10.139
I've learned from my mistakes
and I changed my attitude

25:10.142 --> 25:11.809
(laughs)

25:11.810 --> 25:13.477
I've learned from my mistakes

That's right.

40:01.433 --> 40:03.967
Now who's your sister
in drag?

40:05.203 --> 40:08.638
- Now it's up to us to vote
each other off the island?

40:08.640 --> 40:10.073
Bitch, what show
did I sign up for?

40:10.074 --> 40:11.507
- Now it's up to us to vote
each other off the island?

40:13.412 --> 40:15.578
- I'm in a complete state
of shock.

40:15.580 --> 40:16.229
I forgot
what I was gonna say.

40:16.230 --> 40:16.879
- I'm in a complete state
of shock.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.615
- Now, based on
your performance

40:18.616 --> 40:20.349
- I'm in a complete state
of shock.

40:20.352 --> 40:21.301
in the talent extravaganza,

40:21.302 --> 40:22.251
- I'm in a complete state
of shock.

40:22.254 --> 40:23.653
I've made some decisions.

40:23.654 --> 40:25.053
- I'm in a complete state
of shock.

40:26.057 --> 40:28.358
Alyssa Edwards,

40:28.360 --> 40:29.042
Detox,

40:29.043 --> 40:29.725
Alyssa Edwards,

40:29.728 --> 40:30.710
Katya,

40:30.711 --> 40:31.693
Alyssa Edwards,

40:31.696 --> 40:33.747
you are all safe.

40:33.748 --> 40:35.799
Alyssa Edwards,

40:35.801 --> 40:36.133
- (exhales)

40:36.134 --> 40:36.466
Alyssa Edwards,

40:36.468 --> 40:38.118
- Please step
to the back of the stage.

40:38.119 --> 40:39.769
Alyssa Edwards,

40:41.406 --> 40:43.973
The rest of you represent

40:43.975 --> 40:45.642
the tops and bottoms
of the week.

40:45.643 --> 40:47.310
The rest of you represent

40:47.312 --> 40:48.812
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

40:48.813 --> 40:50.313
The rest of you represent

40:50.315 --> 40:51.615
First up, Adore.

40:51.616 --> 40:52.916
The rest of you represent

40:52.918 --> 40:54.084
- First and foremost,
this is "All Stars 2."

40:54.085 --> 40:55.251
The rest of you represent

40:55.253 --> 40:55.752
This is the best
of the best.

40:55.753 --> 40:56.252
The rest of you represent

40:56.254 --> 40:58.304
I mean, we are looking at
such a powerhouse of talent.

40:58.305 --> 41:00.355
The rest of you represent

41:00.358 --> 41:01.458
I'm going to break down
all the T.

41:01.459 --> 41:02.559
The rest of you represent

41:02.561 --> 41:04.411
If you get hurt, get over it
and up your game.

41:04.412 --> 41:06.262
The rest of you represent

41:06.264 --> 41:06.830
Moving on.

41:06.831 --> 41:07.397
The rest of you represent

41:07.399 --> 41:08.949
I will say,
on a positive note,

41:08.950 --> 41:10.500
The rest of you represent

41:10.502 --> 41:10.934
I didn't hate your hair.

41:10.935 --> 41:11.367
The rest of you represent

41:11.369 --> 41:12.268
- Oh, thanks.
- Which, when you came out,

41:12.269 --> 41:13.168
The rest of you represent

41:13.171 --> 41:13.720
I thought
I was gonna hate it.

41:13.721 --> 41:14.270
The rest of you represent

41:14.272 --> 41:14.888
It didn't suck.
- It's human.

41:14.889 --> 41:15.505
The rest of you represent

41:15.507 --> 41:16.706
- It really doesn't matter
whether it's human or not.

41:16.707 --> 41:17.906
The rest of you represent

41:17.909 --> 41:18.308
- I did it myself.

41:18.309 --> 41:18.708
The rest of you represent

41:18.710 --> 41:19.492
- That shows you've done
something.

41:19.493 --> 41:20.275
The rest of you represent

41:20.278 --> 41:22.245
- Oh.
- Because the outfit, girl.

41:22.246 --> 41:24.213
The rest of you represent

41:24.216 --> 41:24.481
- Okay.

41:24.482 --> 41:24.747
The rest of you represent

41:24.749 --> 41:25.715
- This is
a 14th Street dress,

41:25.716 --> 41:26.682
The rest of you represent

41:26.685 --> 41:27.284
like, that doesn't fit you.

41:27.285 --> 41:27.884
The rest of you represent

41:27.886 --> 41:28.935
I don't care if you're gonna
give me your hog body line

41:28.936 --> 41:29.985
The rest of you represent

41:29.988 --> 41:31.338
or whatever it is.
- Oh, my God.

41:31.339 --> 41:32.689
The rest of you represent

41:32.691 --> 41:33.373
- It's just,
I expected more for you.

41:33.374 --> 41:34.056
The rest of you represent

41:34.059 --> 41:35.225
We see your stuff out there.
You're doing your thing.

41:35.226 --> 41:36.392
The rest of you represent

41:36.394 --> 41:36.810
You've got your album.

41:36.811 --> 41:37.227
The rest of you represent

41:37.229 --> 41:38.645
- Mm-hmm.
- You're rocking the world.

41:38.646 --> 41:40.062
The rest of you represent

41:40.799 --> 41:42.165
- Why the gloves?

41:42.167 --> 41:43.183
- I thought it looked cool
to just kind of, like,

41:43.184 --> 41:44.200
- Why the gloves?

41:44.202 --> 41:45.335
have the focus point
be on the legs.

41:45.336 --> 41:46.469
- Why the gloves?

41:46.471 --> 41:47.070
I thought
it was pretty neat.

41:47.071 --> 41:47.670
- Why the gloves?

41:47.672 --> 41:48.605
- I think
your rock star-ness

41:48.606 --> 41:49.539
- Why the gloves?

41:49.541 --> 41:50.240
needs to be more leather.

41:50.241 --> 41:50.940
- Why the gloves?

41:50.942 --> 41:51.474
- I've got a lot of it,
girl.

41:51.475 --> 41:52.007
- Why the gloves?

41:52.010 --> 41:53.143
- I know, and it needed
to happen, 'cause it didn't.

41:53.144 --> 41:54.277
- Why the gloves?

41:54.279 --> 41:55.478
- Yeah, but, I mean--
yeah.

41:55.479 --> 41:56.678
- Why the gloves?

41:56.681 --> 41:57.080
- But do you care?

41:57.081 --> 41:57.480
- Why the gloves?

41:57.482 --> 41:58.248
'Cause, like,
everything's like blasé.

41:58.249 --> 41:59.015
- Why the gloves?

41:59.017 --> 41:59.933
- Girl, I completely care.

41:59.934 --> 42:00.850
- Why the gloves?

42:00.852 --> 42:02.369
I mean, I've expected, like,
you to kind of go ham,

42:02.370 --> 42:03.887
- Why the gloves?

42:03.889 --> 42:04.538
but you went ham,
so I mean,

42:04.539 --> 42:05.188
- Why the gloves?

42:05.190 --> 42:06.056
that's a human reaction
to kind of feel shit.

42:06.057 --> 42:06.923
- Why the gloves?

42:06.925 --> 42:08.158
- But when I think of you,
I don't think of somebody

42:08.159 --> 42:09.392
- Why the gloves?

42:09.394 --> 42:09.893
who's gonna
come out wearing

42:09.894 --> 42:10.393
- Why the gloves?

42:10.395 --> 42:11.444
some type of glamorous
crazy cinched outfit,

42:11.445 --> 42:12.494
- Why the gloves?

42:12.497 --> 42:13.263
and I think
that's part of your brand,

42:13.264 --> 42:14.030
- Why the gloves?

42:14.032 --> 42:14.898
and I thought
you sounded amazing.

42:14.899 --> 42:15.765
- Why the gloves?

42:15.767 --> 42:16.282
- Thank you so much.

42:16.283 --> 42:16.798
- Why the gloves?

42:16.801 --> 42:18.601
- All right. Let's move on down
to Coco Montrese.

42:18.602 --> 42:20.402
- Why the gloves?

42:20.405 --> 42:21.388
- I thought
it was a very brave move

42:21.389 --> 42:22.372
- Why the gloves?

42:22.374 --> 42:23.073
to do something
very old Hollywood,

42:23.074 --> 42:23.773
- Why the gloves?

42:23.775 --> 42:25.075
but I lost your choreography
with the dress.

42:25.076 --> 42:26.376
- Why the gloves?

42:26.378 --> 42:27.844
And once it got
30 seconds into the number,

42:27.845 --> 42:29.311
- Why the gloves?

42:29.314 --> 42:29.879
it was just
kind of predictable.

42:29.880 --> 42:30.445
- Why the gloves?

42:30.448 --> 42:31.965
- I was waiting
for something to happen,

42:31.966 --> 42:33.483
- Why the gloves?

42:33.485 --> 42:34.201
but the train
didn't leave the station.

42:34.202 --> 42:34.918
- Why the gloves?

42:34.920 --> 42:36.586
- Here's my main thing
tonight.

42:36.587 --> 42:38.253
- Why the gloves?

42:38.256 --> 42:39.305
In your season,
you were orange.

42:39.306 --> 42:40.355
- Why the gloves?

42:40.358 --> 42:41.858
Tonight, you went
from Doritos to soot.

42:41.859 --> 42:43.359
- Why the gloves?

42:43.361 --> 42:44.611
- I thought maybe
you were trying to give us

42:44.612 --> 42:45.862
- Why the gloves?

42:45.864 --> 42:46.963
that kind of silver screen,
old Hollywood look,

42:46.964 --> 42:48.063
- Why the gloves?

42:48.066 --> 42:48.515
but then I thought, wait,

42:48.516 --> 42:48.965
- Why the gloves?

42:48.967 --> 42:49.699
the face and the hands
aren't matching.

42:49.700 --> 42:50.432
- Why the gloves?

42:50.435 --> 42:51.201
- Yeah, I ran out of time
and didn't do my--

42:51.202 --> 42:51.968
- Why the gloves?

42:51.970 --> 42:52.669
- Didn't get to the hands.
- Yeah.

42:52.670 --> 42:53.369
- Why the gloves?

42:53.371 --> 42:53.987
- I wish your hands
would've matched.

42:53.988 --> 42:54.604
- Why the gloves?

42:54.606 --> 42:55.805
Then maybe
you could've sold it to us.

42:55.806 --> 42:57.005
- Why the gloves?

42:57.008 --> 42:57.373
- Okay.

42:57.374 --> 42:57.739
- Why the gloves?

42:57.742 --> 42:58.741
- Up next, Ginger Minj.

42:58.742 --> 42:59.741
- Why the gloves?

42:59.744 --> 43:00.260
- Regarding your voice,

43:00.261 --> 43:00.777
- Why the gloves?

43:00.779 --> 43:01.494
I thought your pitch
was perfect.

43:01.495 --> 43:02.210
- Why the gloves?

43:02.213 --> 43:03.346
- But I felt like this
was a song you would sing

43:03.347 --> 43:04.480
- Why the gloves?

43:04.482 --> 43:05.448
after already performing
for 30 minutes.

43:05.449 --> 43:06.415
- Why the gloves?

43:06.418 --> 43:07.884
This is "All Stars."
I was expecting more.

43:07.885 --> 43:09.351
- Why the gloves?

43:09.354 --> 43:09.919
- You look beautiful
tonight,

43:09.920 --> 43:10.485
- Why the gloves?

43:10.488 --> 43:11.854
but one thing you have to keep
in mind being a plus-sized girl,

43:11.855 --> 43:13.221
- Why the gloves?

43:13.224 --> 43:15.074
when you wear a Palazzo jumpsuit
in that kind of stretchy jersey,

43:15.075 --> 43:16.925
- Why the gloves?

43:16.928 --> 43:18.211
when you walk, it creeps
and it gives you a Va-gegy.

43:18.212 --> 43:19.495
- Why the gloves?

43:19.497 --> 43:21.481
Literally, I couldn't take
my eyes off of your vagina.

43:21.482 --> 43:23.466
- Why the gloves?

43:23.468 --> 43:24.501
- Thank you.

43:24.502 --> 43:25.535
- Why the gloves?

43:25.537 --> 43:26.453
(all laugh)

43:26.454 --> 43:27.370
- Why the gloves?

43:27.372 --> 43:28.521
- Up next, Phi Phi O'Hara.

43:28.522 --> 43:29.671
- Why the gloves?

43:29.674 --> 43:30.807
- Your Balma dress.

43:30.808 --> 43:31.941
- Why the gloves?

43:31.943 --> 43:32.709
You're tiny, Phiph.

43:32.710 --> 43:33.476
- Why the gloves?

43:33.478 --> 43:35.128
It totally encompasses
your teeny little body

43:35.129 --> 43:36.779
- Why the gloves?

43:36.781 --> 43:37.397
and you just
look like a box.

43:37.398 --> 43:38.014
- Why the gloves?

43:38.016 --> 43:39.849
- I think the dress
is spectacular. Sorry.

43:39.850 --> 43:41.683
- Why the gloves?

43:41.686 --> 43:42.285
- When you started to sing,

43:42.286 --> 43:42.885
- Why the gloves?

43:42.887 --> 43:44.537
those first couple of bars of
that a cappella was so powerful.

43:44.538 --> 43:46.188
- Why the gloves?

43:46.191 --> 43:47.507
- But then I couldn't
even focus on your voice

43:47.508 --> 43:48.824
- Why the gloves?

43:48.827 --> 43:49.676
because it was going
in and out of the key

43:49.677 --> 43:50.526
- Why the gloves?

43:50.528 --> 43:51.594
and the audience was clapping
completely different rhythm.

43:51.595 --> 43:52.661
- Why the gloves?

43:52.664 --> 43:53.980
- Right. I would've loved
for there to be

43:53.981 --> 43:55.297
- Why the gloves?

43:55.300 --> 43:55.899
some support for your voice,

43:55.900 --> 43:56.499
- Why the gloves?

43:56.501 --> 43:58.118
because it did get
a little wonky.

43:58.119 --> 43:59.736
- Why the gloves?

43:59.738 --> 44:01.388
- Up next, Roxxxy Andrews.

44:01.389 --> 44:03.039
- Why the gloves?

44:03.041 --> 44:03.456
- I'm grateful to see

44:03.457 --> 44:03.872
- Why the gloves?

44:03.875 --> 44:04.808
that even though through
your weight loss and fitness,

44:04.809 --> 44:05.742
- Why the gloves?

44:05.744 --> 44:06.343
you're still thick
and juicy.

44:06.344 --> 44:06.943
- Why the gloves?

44:06.945 --> 44:08.011
- This ass and these legs
ain't going nowhere.

44:08.012 --> 44:09.078
- Why the gloves?

44:09.080 --> 44:09.929
- Thank you, Dr. Zizmore.

44:09.930 --> 44:10.779
- Why the gloves?

44:10.782 --> 44:11.398
(all laugh)

44:11.399 --> 44:12.015
- Why the gloves?

44:12.017 --> 44:12.933
- I haven't been turned on
by a man like that

44:12.934 --> 44:13.850
- Why the gloves?

44:13.852 --> 44:14.467
in a very long time.

44:14.468 --> 44:15.083
- Why the gloves?

44:15.086 --> 44:16.586
- Maybe you don't sing,
maybe you don't tap dance,

44:16.587 --> 44:18.087
- Why the gloves?

44:18.089 --> 44:20.073
but what you do have
is major charisma.

44:20.074 --> 44:22.058
- Why the gloves?

44:22.060 --> 44:23.093
You're such a superstar.

44:23.094 --> 44:24.127
- Why the gloves?

44:24.129 --> 44:24.711
- And I loved the reveals.

44:24.712 --> 44:25.294
- Why the gloves?

44:25.296 --> 44:26.145
It was like
a Russian nesting doll.

44:26.146 --> 44:26.995
- Why the gloves?

44:26.998 --> 44:27.497
There was wig under a wig.

44:27.498 --> 44:27.997
- Why the gloves?

44:27.999 --> 44:29.265
Your performance
was an event.

44:29.266 --> 44:30.532
- Why the gloves?

44:30.535 --> 44:31.067
- I happen to have on

44:31.068 --> 44:31.600
- Why the gloves?

44:31.603 --> 44:32.819
an extra wig
underneath this one.

44:32.820 --> 44:34.036
- Why the gloves?

44:34.039 --> 44:34.404
(all laugh)

44:34.405 --> 44:34.770
- Why the gloves?

44:34.773 --> 44:35.655
Thank you very much, Roxxxy.

44:35.656 --> 44:36.538
- Why the gloves?

44:36.541 --> 44:36.973
- Thank you.

44:36.974 --> 44:37.406
- Why the gloves?

44:37.409 --> 44:38.391
- Up next, Tatianna.

44:38.392 --> 44:39.374
- Why the gloves?

44:39.377 --> 44:40.109
See me with them hands,
bitch.

44:40.110 --> 44:40.842
- Why the gloves?

44:40.845 --> 44:41.661
- See me with them hands.

44:41.662 --> 44:42.478
- Why the gloves?

44:42.480 --> 44:43.963
- Look at that body.
Are you cinched?

44:43.964 --> 44:45.447
- Why the gloves?

44:45.450 --> 44:45.832
- A little.

44:45.833 --> 44:46.215
- Why the gloves?

44:46.217 --> 44:47.634
- I'm gonna fucking
key your car.

44:47.635 --> 44:49.052
- Why the gloves?

44:49.054 --> 44:50.186
- I was the most skeptical
about your performance

44:50.187 --> 44:51.319
- Why the gloves?

44:51.322 --> 44:52.588
because it was so long since
the time you were on here.

44:52.589 --> 44:53.855
- Why the gloves?

44:53.858 --> 44:54.741
But you were so fresh
and so current,

44:54.742 --> 44:55.625
- Why the gloves?

44:55.627 --> 44:57.227
and I think that you're
a force to be reckoned with

44:57.228 --> 44:58.828
- Why the gloves?

44:58.830 --> 44:59.229
in this competition.

44:59.230 --> 44:59.629
- Why the gloves?

44:59.631 --> 45:00.397
- You let your smarts
do the talking,

45:00.398 --> 45:01.164
- Why the gloves?

45:01.166 --> 45:02.132
and I thought
that was really clever.

45:02.133 --> 45:03.099
- Why the gloves?

45:03.101 --> 45:04.084
There was double entendre.

45:04.085 --> 45:05.068
- Why the gloves?

45:05.070 --> 45:05.802
- You had me at piece.

45:05.803 --> 45:06.535
- Why the gloves?

45:06.538 --> 45:07.370
- (laughs)

45:07.371 --> 45:08.203
- Why the gloves?

45:08.206 --> 45:09.556
- That was so amazing,
so good.

45:09.557 --> 45:10.907
- Why the gloves?

45:10.909 --> 45:12.642
- And congratulations on your
face, because you're gorgeous.

45:12.643 --> 45:14.376
- Why the gloves?

45:14.379 --> 45:15.779
- Okay?
Face is beat, bitch.

45:15.780 --> 45:17.180
- Why the gloves?

45:17.182 --> 45:18.431
The face is beat.

45:18.432 --> 45:19.681
- Why the gloves?

45:19.684 --> 45:20.116
- Thank you.

45:20.117 --> 45:20.549
- Why the gloves?

45:20.552 --> 45:21.017
- Thank you.

45:21.018 --> 45:21.483
- Why the gloves?

45:21.486 --> 45:22.519
- You're welcome.

45:22.520 --> 45:23.553
- Why the gloves?

45:23.555 --> 45:25.455
- Up next,
last but not least, Alaska.

45:25.456 --> 45:27.356
- Why the gloves?

45:27.358 --> 45:27.940
- Your song is genius.

45:27.941 --> 45:28.523
- Why the gloves?

45:28.526 --> 45:29.092
I felt like I took mushrooms

45:29.093 --> 45:29.659
- Why the gloves?

45:29.661 --> 45:30.210
and was watching
"Pick of Destiny,"

45:30.211 --> 45:30.760
- Why the gloves?

45:30.762 --> 45:32.812
and then you flew in
on Valcore and--

45:32.813 --> 45:34.863
- Why the gloves?

45:34.866 --> 45:35.648
(all laugh)

45:35.649 --> 45:36.431
- Why the gloves?

45:36.434 --> 45:37.383
- And I love that
you out-gayed even me.

45:37.384 --> 45:38.333
- Why the gloves?

45:38.336 --> 45:39.819
(all laugh)
I mean, that was fantastic.

45:39.820 --> 45:41.303
- Why the gloves?

45:41.306 --> 45:42.472
My only negative, I would've
like a different nail.

45:42.473 --> 45:43.639
- Why the gloves?

45:43.641 --> 45:45.575
- Yeah. They just drew so much
attention away from the dress.

45:45.576 --> 45:47.510
- Why the gloves?

45:47.512 --> 45:48.161
- I love the nails,
you guys,

45:48.162 --> 45:48.811
- Why the gloves?

45:48.813 --> 45:50.546
'cause they're so wrong
and so right.

45:50.547 --> 45:52.280
- Why the gloves?

45:52.283 --> 45:53.666
- Thank you, ladies.
I think I've heard enough.

45:53.667 --> 45:55.050
- Why the gloves?

45:55.053 --> 45:56.536
Based on
the judges' critiques,

45:56.537 --> 45:58.020
- Why the gloves?

45:58.022 --> 45:59.122
I've made some decisions.

45:59.123 --> 46:00.223
- Why the gloves?

46:00.225 --> 46:02.692
Roxxxy Andrews, Tatianna,

46:02.693 --> 46:05.160
- Why the gloves?

46:05.163 --> 46:07.130
you are the top two "All Stars"
of the week.

46:07.131 --> 46:09.098
- Why the gloves?

46:09.100 --> 46:10.283
(applause)

46:10.284 --> 46:11.467
- Why the gloves?

46:11.469 --> 46:12.018
Con-drag-ulations.

46:12.019 --> 46:12.568
- Why the gloves?

46:12.570 --> 46:14.354
You've each won
a custom jewel collection

46:14.355 --> 46:16.139
- Why the gloves?

46:16.141 --> 46:17.140
from Fierce Drag Jewels.

46:17.141 --> 46:18.140
- Why the gloves?

46:18.143 --> 46:19.476
- I am in the top two.

46:19.477 --> 46:20.810
- Why the gloves?

46:20.812 --> 46:21.461
I cannot believe it.

46:21.462 --> 46:22.111
- Why the gloves?

46:22.113 --> 46:23.096
I'm ready to lip synch,
child.

46:23.097 --> 46:24.080
- Why the gloves?

46:24.082 --> 46:24.664
What's my song?

46:24.665 --> 46:25.247
- Why the gloves?

46:25.250 --> 46:27.534
- I am so happy.

46:27.535 --> 46:29.819
- Why the gloves?

46:30.555 --> 46:34.957
- Alaska, Ginger,
you are safe.

46:34.959 --> 46:38.594
That means Adore, Coco
and Phi Phi,

46:38.595 --> 46:42.230
- Alaska, Ginger,
you are safe.

46:42.233 --> 46:43.883
you are in the bottom three.

46:43.884 --> 46:45.534
- Alaska, Ginger,
you are safe.

46:46.871 --> 46:49.038
- I'm crushed.

46:49.040 --> 46:50.440
I'm baffled.

46:50.441 --> 46:51.841
- I'm crushed.

46:51.843 --> 46:52.926
I just feel like
I'm gonna vomit.

46:52.927 --> 46:54.010
- I'm crushed.

46:54.012 --> 46:54.461
Like, I watch competitions

46:54.462 --> 46:54.911
- I'm crushed.

46:54.913 --> 46:55.995
and I'm like, how do people
get to that point?

46:55.996 --> 46:57.078
- I'm crushed.

46:57.081 --> 46:58.531
And it's not a good feeling
at all.

46:58.532 --> 46:59.982
- I'm crushed.

46:59.984 --> 47:01.384
Uh, no, it's...uh-uh.

47:01.385 --> 47:02.785
- I'm crushed.

47:02.787 --> 47:05.121
- Tatianna and Roxxxy,
each of you needs to decide

47:05.122 --> 47:07.456
- I'm crushed.

47:07.458 --> 47:08.958
which of the bottom queens
you'll eliminate

47:08.959 --> 47:10.459
- I'm crushed.

47:10.461 --> 47:11.410
if you win the lip synch.

47:11.411 --> 47:12.360
- I'm crushed.

47:12.363 --> 47:14.580
And I'll remind you that
the winner of the lip synch

47:14.581 --> 47:16.798
- I'm crushed.

47:16.801 --> 47:18.217
will win $10,000 cash.

47:18.218 --> 47:19.634
- I'm crushed.

47:19.637 --> 47:22.622
So while you ladies
deliberate in the work room,

47:22.623 --> 47:25.608
- I'm crushed.

47:25.610 --> 47:27.827
the judges and I will enjoy
a fruity cocktail.

47:27.828 --> 47:30.045
- I'm crushed.

47:30.048 --> 47:30.597
- (slurps)

47:30.598 --> 47:31.147
- I'm crushed.

47:31.149 --> 47:32.165
- You may leave the stage.

47:32.166 --> 47:33.182
- I'm crushed.

47:33.184 --> 47:33.933
Coming up...

47:33.934 --> 47:34.683
- I'm crushed.

47:34.686 --> 47:35.852
- I'm gonna lose a friend.

47:35.853 --> 47:37.019
- I'm crushed.

47:37.021 --> 47:38.154
- She's gonna probably
send me home next week.

47:38.155 --> 47:39.288
- I'm crushed.

47:39.290 --> 47:40.640
I'm gonna send her home now.

47:40.641 --> 47:41.991
- I'm crushed.

47:41.993 --> 47:43.209
(RuPaul laughs)

47:43.210 --> 47:44.426
- I'm crushed.

47:45.129 --> 47:48.030
(RuPaul laughs)

47:50.835 --> 47:51.367
- Girl.

47:51.369 --> 47:53.019
- As we walk into the room,
you could hear a pin drop.

47:53.020 --> 47:54.670
- Girl.

47:54.672 --> 47:55.021
It's silent.

47:55.022 --> 47:55.371
- Girl.

47:55.373 --> 47:56.189
We're all nervous
because we don't know

47:56.190 --> 47:57.006
- Girl.

47:57.008 --> 47:58.107
how this deliberation
is going to work.

47:58.108 --> 47:59.207
- Girl.

47:59.210 --> 48:00.410
You don't really know.

48:00.411 --> 48:01.611
- Girl.

48:01.613 --> 48:02.295
- I do not envy you guys
at all.

48:02.296 --> 48:02.978
- Girl.

48:02.981 --> 48:04.013
I would not want to be
in your fuckin shoes.

48:04.014 --> 48:05.046
- Girl.

48:05.049 --> 48:05.982
- We're eliminating
our sisters.

48:05.983 --> 48:06.916
- Girl.

48:06.918 --> 48:07.467
- Exactly. That's the thing.

48:07.468 --> 48:08.017
- Girl.

48:08.019 --> 48:08.651
- And, you know,
what do you do?

48:08.652 --> 48:09.284
- Girl.

48:09.287 --> 48:10.853
Eliminate competition
or do you eliminate somebody

48:10.854 --> 48:12.420
- Girl.

48:12.423 --> 48:13.022
because you think
they were weak?

48:13.023 --> 48:13.622
- Girl.

48:13.625 --> 48:14.324
- Do you eliminate
who you think did the weakest

48:14.325 --> 48:15.024
- Girl.

48:15.026 --> 48:16.326
or do you eliminate the
strongest to-- (clicks tongue)

48:16.327 --> 48:17.627
- Girl.

48:17.629 --> 48:19.829
- And if you squeak by
just because of a friendship,

48:19.830 --> 48:22.030
- Girl.

48:22.033 --> 48:23.199
don't you think, like,
the backlash from that

48:23.200 --> 48:24.366
- Girl.

48:24.369 --> 48:25.118
is going to be worse?

48:25.119 --> 48:25.868
- Girl.

48:25.870 --> 48:26.269
It needs to be fair.

48:26.270 --> 48:26.669
- Girl.

48:26.671 --> 48:28.621
- This sucks, but
a decision has to be made.

48:28.622 --> 48:30.572
- Girl.

48:30.575 --> 48:32.075
My perspective
is you have to base it

48:32.076 --> 48:33.576
- Girl.

48:33.578 --> 48:34.327
off of the challenge itself.

48:34.328 --> 48:35.077
- Girl.

48:35.079 --> 48:35.678
That seems like the only way

48:35.679 --> 48:36.278
- Girl.

48:36.281 --> 48:38.248
we can find some fairness
out of this entire crazy thing

48:38.249 --> 48:40.216
- Girl.

48:40.218 --> 48:41.234
that Ru has thrown at us.
- Yes.

48:41.235 --> 48:42.251
- Girl.

48:42.253 --> 48:43.986
- If there's a week where you
feel like I was like booger,

48:43.987 --> 48:45.720
- Girl.

48:45.723 --> 48:46.806
send me home.

48:46.807 --> 48:47.890
- Girl.

48:47.892 --> 48:48.391
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

48:48.392 --> 48:48.891
- Girl.

48:48.893 --> 48:50.610
- But a lot of what they said
negative, I didn't agree with.

48:50.611 --> 48:52.328
- Girl.

48:52.330 --> 48:54.797
And if I'm going to have to be
the judge at the end of the day,

48:54.798 --> 48:57.265
- Girl.

48:57.268 --> 48:58.184
like, I'm going off
of what I'm thinking

48:58.185 --> 48:59.101
- Girl.

48:59.103 --> 49:00.019
and not necessarily
what the judges are saying.

49:00.020 --> 49:00.936
- Girl.

49:00.939 --> 49:02.655
- But, you know, that's why
they're the professionals.

49:02.656 --> 49:04.372
- Girl.

49:04.375 --> 49:05.791
- Well, it's funny, because
I said, you know what?

49:05.792 --> 49:07.208
- Girl.

49:07.211 --> 49:07.877
I don't need to be paid.

49:07.878 --> 49:08.544
- Girl.

49:08.546 --> 49:09.228
I will pay you.

49:09.229 --> 49:09.911
- Girl.

49:09.914 --> 49:10.346
- Oh!
- Yes!

49:10.347 --> 49:10.779
- Girl.

49:10.782 --> 49:12.332
- I like that.
- It's the truth, though.

49:12.333 --> 49:13.883
- Girl.

49:13.885 --> 49:14.367
- (laughs)

49:14.368 --> 49:14.850
- Girl.

49:14.852 --> 49:15.835
- This is delicious.
- Mmm.

49:15.836 --> 49:16.819
- Girl.

49:16.821 --> 49:18.221
- Let's say a few weeks
down the line,

49:18.222 --> 49:19.622
- Girl.

49:19.624 --> 49:21.841
there's someone that you know
could totally kick you off.

49:21.842 --> 49:24.059
- Girl.

49:24.062 --> 49:24.494
Things can change.

49:24.495 --> 49:24.927
- Girl.

49:24.929 --> 49:25.745
Like, we could totally
be like, nope,

49:25.746 --> 49:26.562
- Girl.

49:26.564 --> 49:27.396
she's gonna probably
send me home next week.

49:27.397 --> 49:28.229
- Girl.

49:28.232 --> 49:29.181
I'm gonna send her home now.

49:29.182 --> 49:30.131
- Girl.

49:30.134 --> 49:30.583
- That's what would suck.

49:30.584 --> 49:31.033
- Girl.

49:31.035 --> 49:31.601
Bitch,
I could've sent you home,

49:31.602 --> 49:32.168
- Girl.

49:32.170 --> 49:33.119
and now you just want to send me
home because you're spiteful?

49:33.120 --> 49:34.069
- Girl.

49:34.072 --> 49:34.404
Okay, well--

49:34.405 --> 49:34.737
- Girl.

49:34.739 --> 49:35.455
- Well, it's not even
necessarily spiteful,

49:35.456 --> 49:36.172
- Girl.

49:36.174 --> 49:37.206
more so
than being strategic.

49:37.207 --> 49:38.239
- Girl.

49:38.242 --> 49:40.443
- I don't think that the
decision to send someone home

49:40.444 --> 49:42.645
- Girl.

49:42.647 --> 49:44.664
will always be based on the
challenge or the critiques.

49:44.665 --> 49:46.682
- Girl.

49:46.684 --> 49:48.334
I think later on, people
will choose friendships.

49:48.335 --> 49:49.985
- Girl.

49:49.988 --> 49:51.571
I think alliances will
definitely start to factor in

49:51.572 --> 49:53.155
- Girl.

49:53.157 --> 49:54.640
and girls will start
kicking off other girls

49:54.641 --> 49:56.124
- Girl.

49:56.127 --> 49:57.410
who they feel are a threat.

49:57.411 --> 49:58.694
- Girl.

49:58.696 --> 50:00.012
Anything could happen
in this situation.

50:00.013 --> 50:01.329
- Girl.

50:01.332 --> 50:01.797
- This is the thing.

50:01.798 --> 50:02.263
- Girl.

50:02.266 --> 50:02.682
If we stick to critiques

50:02.683 --> 50:03.099
- Girl.

50:03.101 --> 50:04.284
and everybody say that
that's what we're going to do,

50:04.285 --> 50:05.468
- Girl.

50:05.470 --> 50:06.769
then you know already
who's going home.

50:06.770 --> 50:08.069
- Girl.

50:08.072 --> 50:08.821
- Do you know
who you're sending home?

50:08.822 --> 50:09.571
- Girl.

50:09.574 --> 50:10.540
- No. I want to have
the conversation

50:10.541 --> 50:11.507
- Girl.

50:11.509 --> 50:12.925
with all three girls,
just for a quick second.

50:12.926 --> 50:14.342
- Girl.

50:14.345 --> 50:15.411
You want to come first?

50:15.412 --> 50:16.478
- Girl.

50:20.051 --> 50:20.850
- I'm terrified.

50:20.852 --> 50:21.451
All I'm thinking right now

50:21.452 --> 50:22.051
- I'm terrified.

50:22.053 --> 50:23.052
is, like, you just got here

50:23.053 --> 50:24.052
- I'm terrified.

50:24.055 --> 50:24.704
and then you get put
in the bottom

50:24.705 --> 50:25.354
- I'm terrified.

50:25.356 --> 50:25.938
on something
that you love doing.

50:25.939 --> 50:26.521
- I'm terrified.

50:26.524 --> 50:27.757
And you haven't even
shown the world

50:27.758 --> 50:28.991
- I'm terrified.

50:28.993 --> 50:30.343
this Phi Phi that you've
worked so hard to build up.

50:30.344 --> 50:31.694
- I'm terrified.

50:31.696 --> 50:32.829
And I don't feel from
from the judges critiques

50:32.830 --> 50:33.963
- I'm terrified.

50:33.965 --> 50:34.614
I was in the bottom.

50:34.615 --> 50:35.264
- I'm terrified.

50:35.266 --> 50:35.665
I honestly don't.

50:35.666 --> 50:36.065
- I'm terrified.

50:36.067 --> 50:36.849
I think they were
way harder on Coco,

50:36.850 --> 50:37.632
- I'm terrified.

50:37.635 --> 50:38.885
and I think they were
extremely hard on Adore.

50:38.886 --> 50:40.136
- I'm terrified.

50:40.138 --> 50:41.654
- I'm going off of
who I thought was the weakest,

50:41.655 --> 50:43.171
- I'm terrified.

50:43.174 --> 50:43.890
and that's what
I'm making my decision.

50:43.891 --> 50:44.607
- I'm terrified.

50:44.609 --> 50:45.408
- No, totally, no, and I get it,
but it's scary.

50:45.409 --> 50:46.208
- I'm terrified.

50:46.210 --> 50:48.260
I worked too hard
to be here.

50:48.261 --> 50:50.311
- I'm terrified.

50:50.314 --> 50:51.614
- Phi Phi is upset,
and I don't blame her.

50:51.615 --> 50:52.915
- I'm terrified.

50:52.917 --> 50:53.933
I feel for her and I think
I'd feel the same way.

50:53.934 --> 50:54.950
- I'm terrified.

50:54.952 --> 50:56.952
But at the same time,
I know for myself,

50:56.953 --> 50:58.953
- I'm terrified.

50:58.956 --> 50:59.422
I came to play a fair game,

50:59.423 --> 50:59.889
- I'm terrified.

50:59.891 --> 51:00.807
and I'm going to choose
the girl that I feel

51:00.808 --> 51:01.724
- I'm terrified.

51:01.726 --> 51:03.576
was the girl that RuPaul
would send home.

51:03.577 --> 51:05.427
- I'm terrified.

51:05.630 --> 51:09.465
- I'm not pulling anyone over
to talk to them in private

51:09.467 --> 51:10.533
because based on
the performances,

51:10.534 --> 51:11.600
- I'm not pulling anyone over
to talk to them in private

51:11.602 --> 51:12.101
I have a pretty good idea

51:12.102 --> 51:12.601
- I'm not pulling anyone over
to talk to them in private

51:12.603 --> 51:15.171
of who I will eliminate
if I have to.

51:15.172 --> 51:17.740
- I'm not pulling anyone over
to talk to them in private

51:18.342 --> 51:19.942
- What's the D, bitch?

51:19.944 --> 51:21.160
- Girl, it's a struggle.

51:21.161 --> 51:22.377
- What's the D, bitch?

51:22.380 --> 51:23.629
- I'm feeling
a bit embarrassed.

51:23.630 --> 51:24.879
- What's the D, bitch?

51:24.882 --> 51:25.581
You know,
working on my confidence

51:25.582 --> 51:26.281
- What's the D, bitch?

51:26.284 --> 51:26.983
and just growing so much,

51:26.984 --> 51:27.683
- What's the D, bitch?

51:27.685 --> 51:28.701
I didn't think that
a lot of these feelings

51:28.702 --> 51:29.718
- What's the D, bitch?

51:29.720 --> 51:30.136
would be coming back.

51:30.137 --> 51:30.553
- What's the D, bitch?

51:30.555 --> 51:31.421
And it's not a feeling
that, like,

51:31.422 --> 51:32.288
- What's the D, bitch?

51:32.290 --> 51:33.639
I'm completely obsessed
with right now.

51:33.640 --> 51:34.989
- What's the D, bitch?

51:34.992 --> 51:35.491
My thing is,
I came into here

51:35.492 --> 51:35.991
- What's the D, bitch?

51:35.993 --> 51:37.860
with a different idea
of what it was going to be.

51:37.861 --> 51:39.728
- What's the D, bitch?

51:39.730 --> 51:40.179
I literally work at, like,

51:40.180 --> 51:40.629
- What's the D, bitch?

51:40.631 --> 51:41.747
punk rock venues
for a living with a band.

51:41.748 --> 51:42.864
- What's the D, bitch?

51:42.867 --> 51:44.250
Like, I wear T-shirts
and, like--I'm like--

51:44.251 --> 51:45.634
- What's the D, bitch?

51:45.636 --> 51:46.902
I'm like a drag musician,
so to be told that, like,

51:46.903 --> 51:48.169
- What's the D, bitch?

51:48.172 --> 51:49.872
I have to be put back into
a bubble of cinching my waist,

51:49.873 --> 51:51.573
- What's the D, bitch?

51:51.576 --> 51:53.026
it's just not the G
for me.

51:53.027 --> 51:54.477
- What's the D, bitch?

51:55.413 --> 51:57.746
I, like, wrote this song,

51:57.748 --> 51:59.482
and this shit
is personal to me.

51:59.483 --> 52:01.217
I, like, wrote this song,

52:01.219 --> 52:04.654
Like, music is, like,
my fuckin gateway, man.

52:04.655 --> 52:08.090
I, like, wrote this song,

52:08.092 --> 52:09.141
So it's hard.

52:09.142 --> 52:10.191
I, like, wrote this song,

52:10.194 --> 52:11.310
- I get it, girl.

52:11.311 --> 52:12.427
I, like, wrote this song,

52:15.166 --> 52:16.465
You belong here.

52:16.467 --> 52:17.800
I think that
it was just a hard day.

52:17.801 --> 52:19.134
You belong here.

52:19.137 --> 52:20.370
I feel like Adore
came back on here,

52:20.371 --> 52:21.604
You belong here.

52:21.606 --> 52:23.322
but she didn't think over
the part

52:23.323 --> 52:25.039
You belong here.

52:25.042 --> 52:27.042
about going back on that runway
and exposing yourself

52:27.043 --> 52:29.043
You belong here.

52:29.046 --> 52:30.129
and putting yourself up there
to be critiqued.

52:30.130 --> 52:31.213
You belong here.

52:31.215 --> 52:32.231
And I don't think
she was ready for that.

52:32.232 --> 52:33.248
You belong here.

52:33.251 --> 52:34.350
- Cocs, she wants to talk.

52:34.351 --> 52:35.450
You belong here.

52:35.453 --> 52:36.853
- My heart's in my stomach
right now.

52:36.854 --> 52:38.254
You belong here.

52:38.256 --> 52:38.771
I'm praying
that Roxxxy wins.

52:38.772 --> 52:39.287
You belong here.

52:39.290 --> 52:40.806
We're from the same season.
We're closer sisters.

52:40.807 --> 52:42.323
You belong here.

52:42.326 --> 52:42.742
- What's the T, girl?

52:42.743 --> 52:43.159
You belong here.

52:43.161 --> 52:44.110
- I stepped out
of what I normally do.

52:44.111 --> 52:45.060
You belong here.

52:45.062 --> 52:45.861
I do it seven nights a week.

52:45.862 --> 52:46.661
You belong here.

52:46.664 --> 52:47.546
And then, it's like,
yeah, we get it,

52:47.547 --> 52:48.429
You belong here.

52:48.432 --> 52:49.648
but you needed to be
a little bit more.

52:49.649 --> 52:50.865
You belong here.

52:50.868 --> 52:51.701
I'm like, I...

52:51.702 --> 52:52.535
You belong here.

52:52.537 --> 52:54.037
- Now, if you were in this
position, what do you do?

52:54.038 --> 52:55.538
You belong here.

52:55.540 --> 52:56.723
If I sent Adore home,
we just met.

52:56.724 --> 52:57.907
You belong here.

52:57.909 --> 52:58.725
She's gonna be like,
oh, well, she's still a bitch.

52:58.726 --> 52:59.542
You belong here.

52:59.544 --> 53:00.543
If I sent you home,
you're my lifelong friend.

53:00.544 --> 53:01.543
You belong here.

53:01.546 --> 53:02.895
We go back before
all this bullshit.

53:02.896 --> 53:04.245
You belong here.

53:04.248 --> 53:05.831
I'm gonna lose a friend.
- No.

53:05.832 --> 53:07.415
You belong here.

53:07.418 --> 53:08.484
- You tell me
if I send Phi Phi home,

53:08.485 --> 53:09.551
You belong here.

53:09.554 --> 53:10.286
is she not gonna
stop talking to me?

53:10.287 --> 53:11.019
You belong here.

53:11.022 --> 53:11.754
- I feel like Roxxxy's
leaning

53:11.755 --> 53:12.487
You belong here.

53:12.490 --> 53:13.589
a little bit more
towards Phi Phi.

53:13.590 --> 53:14.689
You belong here.

53:14.692 --> 53:15.725
I'm hoping that's the case.

53:15.726 --> 53:16.759
You belong here.

53:16.761 --> 53:17.343
- You know what?

53:17.344 --> 53:17.926
You belong here.

53:17.929 --> 53:18.661
This is a fuckin
hard decision.

53:18.662 --> 53:19.394
You belong here.

53:19.397 --> 53:20.346
Is this money
really going to be worth

53:20.347 --> 53:21.296
You belong here.

53:21.299 --> 53:22.598
me losing
these girls' friendships?

53:22.599 --> 53:23.898
You belong here.

53:23.901 --> 53:24.800
There's too much at stake.

53:24.801 --> 53:25.700
You belong here.

53:25.703 --> 53:26.936
- I know this was your whole
hang-up coming into it

53:26.937 --> 53:28.170
You belong here.

53:28.172 --> 53:29.872
was them coming
for your aesthetic.

53:29.873 --> 53:31.573
You belong here.

53:31.576 --> 53:31.924
- Completely.

53:31.925 --> 53:32.273
You belong here.

53:32.276 --> 53:33.342
- Adore's very opinionated
about her look,

53:33.343 --> 53:34.409
You belong here.

53:34.412 --> 53:36.078
and I knew particularly Michelle
was gonna go in on it

53:36.079 --> 53:37.745
You belong here.

53:37.748 --> 53:38.981
because she and Michelle
had this dynamic on tour

53:38.982 --> 53:40.215
You belong here.

53:40.218 --> 53:41.484
where she would go every day
that we would do a show,

53:41.485 --> 53:42.751
You belong here.

53:42.753 --> 53:43.636
she would go, Michelle,
what do you think about this?

53:43.637 --> 53:44.520
You belong here.

53:44.522 --> 53:45.254
And Michelle
would just go, ugh.

53:45.255 --> 53:45.987
You belong here.

53:45.990 --> 53:46.589
- But when it comes
to aesthetic,

53:46.590 --> 53:47.189
You belong here.

53:47.191 --> 53:49.008
I've taken all of their
fuckin amazing knowledge,

53:49.009 --> 53:50.826
You belong here.

53:50.828 --> 53:52.144
shit that Michelle and I
argue with on the road,

53:52.145 --> 53:53.461
You belong here.

53:53.464 --> 53:54.213
I've taken--
- Constantly.

53:54.214 --> 53:54.963
You belong here.

53:54.966 --> 53:55.298
And I've taken.

53:55.299 --> 53:55.631
You belong here.

53:55.633 --> 53:56.299
- And I've taken
and I've used it.

53:56.300 --> 53:56.966
You belong here.

53:56.968 --> 53:57.967
And I brought all this T
to come here

53:57.968 --> 53:58.967
You belong here.

53:58.970 --> 54:00.253
and fit the challenges
in my own definition.

54:00.254 --> 54:01.537
You belong here.

54:01.539 --> 54:02.154
- And get where
they're coming from.

54:02.155 --> 54:02.770
You belong here.

54:02.773 --> 54:03.439
They're feeling 'cause
you're in "All Stars,"

54:03.440 --> 54:04.106
You belong here.

54:04.108 --> 54:04.573
they want you to step it up.

54:04.574 --> 54:05.039
You belong here.

54:05.042 --> 54:06.775
But it's like, this, to me,
for you, is stepping it up.

54:06.776 --> 54:08.509
You belong here.

54:08.512 --> 54:09.144
- If they're ruining this,

54:09.145 --> 54:09.777
You belong here.

54:09.780 --> 54:11.330
what Bianca Del Rio
picked out for me,

54:11.331 --> 54:12.881
You belong here.

54:12.883 --> 54:13.983
girl, like, good luck.

54:13.984 --> 54:15.084
You belong here.

54:15.086 --> 54:16.068
Uh...

54:16.069 --> 54:17.051
You belong here.

54:19.624 --> 54:22.124
(sniffles)

54:23.127 --> 54:25.761
I've worked a lot
on my confidence,

54:25.763 --> 54:27.163
and I feel like
the critiques

54:27.164 --> 54:28.564
I've worked a lot
on my confidence,

54:28.566 --> 54:29.916
were picking at the confidence
that I built up.

54:29.917 --> 54:31.267
I've worked a lot
on my confidence,

54:31.269 --> 54:32.702
And at this point,
it's bringing me back

54:32.703 --> 54:34.136
I've worked a lot
on my confidence,

54:34.138 --> 54:36.055
to baby Adore days
of being defeated,

54:36.056 --> 54:37.973
I've worked a lot
on my confidence,

54:37.975 --> 54:40.226
and I can't relive that.

54:40.227 --> 54:42.478
I've worked a lot
on my confidence,

54:43.681 --> 54:46.515
- You're all wrong,
because it's pork chop.

54:46.517 --> 54:47.216
- Oh!
(all laugh)

54:47.217 --> 54:47.916
- You're all wrong,
because it's pork chop.

54:47.918 --> 54:49.618
- Wait, wait, wait.
Silence, silence!

54:49.619 --> 54:51.319
- You're all wrong,
because it's pork chop.

54:51.322 --> 54:52.555
Bring back my...

54:52.556 --> 54:53.789
- You're all wrong,
because it's pork chop.

54:53.791 --> 54:55.207
(inhales deeply)

54:55.208 --> 54:56.624
- You're all wrong,
because it's pork chop.

54:56.627 --> 54:57.610
Girls.

54:57.611 --> 54:58.594
- You're all wrong,
because it's pork chop.

55:02.433 --> 55:03.132
- This is it.

55:03.134 --> 55:05.368
We have to pick out a lipstick
of who we think should go home.

55:05.369 --> 55:07.603
- This is it.

55:08.005 --> 55:10.973
- (sighs) It's definitely
a heavy feeling.

55:10.975 --> 55:12.041
These are girls
that we're friends

55:12.042 --> 55:13.108
- (sighs) It's definitely
a heavy feeling.

55:13.110 --> 55:14.376
and we work together
out in the real world.

55:14.377 --> 55:15.643
- (sighs) It's definitely
a heavy feeling.

55:15.646 --> 55:18.414
And you know that you have
the power to dash their dreams.

55:18.415 --> 55:21.183
- (sighs) It's definitely
a heavy feeling.

55:25.589 --> 55:27.823
- I think I know
who I'm sending home.

55:27.825 --> 55:29.759
And if I win this lip sync,

55:29.760 --> 55:31.694
- I think I know
who I'm sending home.

55:31.696 --> 55:32.995
I don't feel like she's
going to talk to me again.

55:32.996 --> 55:34.295
- I think I know
who I'm sending home.

55:34.298 --> 55:36.265
But I just--I can't--

55:36.266 --> 55:38.233
- I think I know
who I'm sending home.

55:38.235 --> 55:38.751
I can't eliminate somebody

55:38.752 --> 55:39.268
- I think I know
who I'm sending home.

55:39.270 --> 55:40.252
that I feel
should still be here.

55:40.253 --> 55:41.235
- I think I know
who I'm sending home.

55:41.238 --> 55:42.021
I just can't do it.

55:42.022 --> 55:42.805
- I think I know
who I'm sending home.

55:45.042 --> 55:47.476
(RuPaul laughs)

55:48.212 --> 55:50.946
(RuPaul laughs)

55:54.552 --> 55:56.018
- Welcome back, ladies.

55:56.020 --> 55:57.987
Two top "All Stars"
stand before me.

55:57.988 --> 55:59.955
- Welcome back, ladies.

55:59.957 --> 56:02.208
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me,

56:02.209 --> 56:04.460
- Welcome back, ladies.

56:04.462 --> 56:06.329
win $10,000,
and earn the power

56:06.330 --> 56:08.197
- Welcome back, ladies.

56:08.199 --> 56:10.933
to give one of the bottom queens
the chop.

56:10.934 --> 56:13.668
- Welcome back, ladies.

56:14.772 --> 56:19.308
The time has come
to lip sync...

56:19.310 --> 56:20.943
(echoing)
for your legacy.

56:20.944 --> 56:22.577
The time has come
to lip sync...

56:24.048 --> 56:25.514
- I'm making sure

56:25.516 --> 56:27.133
that I am going to
work it the fuck out.

56:27.134 --> 56:28.751
- I'm making sure

56:28.753 --> 56:29.452
I've got my eye
on the prize.

56:29.453 --> 56:30.152
- I'm making sure

56:30.154 --> 56:30.703
I want this first win,

56:30.704 --> 56:31.253
- I'm making sure

56:31.255 --> 56:32.371
and I really want
that $10,000.

56:32.372 --> 56:33.488
- I'm making sure

56:33.491 --> 56:35.391
- I haven't seen Tatianna
perform since Season 2.

56:35.392 --> 56:37.292
- I'm making sure

56:37.294 --> 56:37.826
Does she kick?
Does she split?

56:37.827 --> 56:38.359
- I'm making sure

56:38.362 --> 56:39.161
Does she buck?
I don't know,

56:39.162 --> 56:39.961
- I'm making sure

56:39.964 --> 56:40.813
but I got a whole lot
of shake it,

56:40.814 --> 56:41.663
- I'm making sure

56:41.665 --> 56:42.915
shake it,
shake, shake, shake it off.

56:42.916 --> 56:44.166
- I'm making sure

56:44.168 --> 56:47.052
- Good luck,
and don't fuck up.

56:47.053 --> 56:49.937
- I'm making sure

56:51.642 --> 56:54.276
- ¶ I stay up too late ¶

56:54.278 --> 56:55.778
¶ Got nothing in my brain ¶

56:55.779 --> 56:57.279
- ¶ I stay up too late ¶

56:57.281 --> 56:58.581
¶ That's what people say,
mm-hmm ¶

56:58.582 --> 56:59.882
- ¶ I stay up too late ¶

56:59.884 --> 57:01.584
¶ That's what people say,
mm-hmm ¶

57:01.585 --> 57:03.285
- ¶ I stay up too late ¶

57:03.287 --> 57:04.353
¶ But I keep cruising ¶

57:04.354 --> 57:05.420
- ¶ I stay up too late ¶

57:05.423 --> 57:06.706
¶ Can't stop,
won't stop moving ¶

57:06.707 --> 57:07.990
- ¶ I stay up too late ¶

57:07.992 --> 57:10.376
¶ It's like I got this music
in my body ¶

57:10.377 --> 57:12.761
- ¶ I stay up too late ¶

57:12.763 --> 57:14.063
¶ Saying it's gonna be
all right ¶

57:14.064 --> 57:15.364
- ¶ I stay up too late ¶

57:15.366 --> 57:16.866
¶ 'Cause the players gonna play,
play, play, play, play ¶

57:16.867 --> 57:18.367
- ¶ I stay up too late ¶

57:18.369 --> 57:19.752
¶ And the haters gonna hate,

57:19.753 --> 57:21.136

57:21.138 --> 57:22.972
¶ Baby, I'm just gonna shake,

57:22.973 --> 57:24.807
- ¶ I stay up too late ¶

57:24.809 --> 57:26.425
¶ Shake it off,
I shake it off ¶

57:26.426 --> 57:28.042
- ¶ I stay up too late ¶

57:28.045 --> 57:29.194
My ex-man brought
his new girlfriend.

57:29.195 --> 57:30.344
- ¶ I stay up too late ¶

57:30.347 --> 57:31.730
She's like, oh, my God,
but I'm just gonna shake.

57:31.731 --> 57:33.114
- ¶ I stay up too late ¶

57:33.117 --> 57:34.733
And to the fella over there
with the hella good hair,

57:34.734 --> 57:36.350
- ¶ I stay up too late ¶

57:36.353 --> 57:38.353
won't you come on over, baby,
we can shake, shake, shake.

57:38.354 --> 57:40.354
- ¶ I stay up too late ¶

57:40.357 --> 57:41.256
- (laughs)
- ¶ Yeah, oh ¶

57:41.257 --> 57:42.156

57:42.159 --> 57:43.776

57:55.705 --> 57:56.637

57:56.640 --> 57:59.224
¶ You've got to shake it off,
I shake it off ¶

57:59.225 --> 58:01.809
- ¶ I stay up too late ¶

58:02.379 --> 58:05.414
( cheers and applause)

58:05.416 --> 58:06.599
- Yeah, shakers.

58:06.600 --> 58:07.783
( cheers and applause)

58:08.385 --> 58:12.721
- Ladies,
I've made my decision.

58:17.461 --> 58:20.429
Roxxxy Andrews...

58:20.431 --> 58:21.514
you're a winner, baby.

58:21.515 --> 58:22.598
Roxxxy Andrews...

58:22.600 --> 58:24.083
(applause)

58:24.084 --> 58:25.567
Roxxxy Andrews...

58:25.569 --> 58:26.769
- Thank you so much.

58:26.770 --> 58:27.970
Roxxxy Andrews...

58:27.972 --> 58:28.788
Who do you think won
the lip sync?

58:28.789 --> 58:29.605
Roxxxy Andrews...

58:29.607 --> 58:30.756
I did.
Oh, my God, I'm so excited.

58:30.757 --> 58:31.906
Roxxxy Andrews...

58:31.909 --> 58:32.725
I came on this show
to prove something,

58:32.726 --> 58:33.542
Roxxxy Andrews...

58:33.544 --> 58:34.810
and I'm already
starting it off good, girl.

58:34.811 --> 58:36.077
Roxxxy Andrews...

58:36.080 --> 58:38.531
- You've earned a cash tip
of $10,000.

58:38.532 --> 58:40.983
Roxxxy Andrews...

58:40.985 --> 58:42.001
- My biggest tip yet.

58:42.002 --> 58:43.018
Roxxxy Andrews...

58:44.822 --> 58:48.757
- Tatianna, you are safe.

58:48.759 --> 58:49.625
- Thank you.

58:49.626 --> 58:50.492
- Tatianna, you are safe.

58:55.099 --> 58:59.835
- Will the bottom three
please step forward?

59:05.509 --> 59:11.179
Roxxxy, with great power
comes great responsibility.

59:11.382 --> 59:15.717
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

59:15.719 --> 59:16.885
- When I was making
my decision,

59:16.886 --> 59:18.052
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

59:18.055 --> 59:18.954
I put myself in your shoes.

59:18.955 --> 59:19.854
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

59:19.857 --> 59:21.557
Listening to your critiques, and
we got to watch the talent show,

59:21.558 --> 59:23.258
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

59:23.260 --> 59:24.643
my decision was based off of

59:24.644 --> 59:26.027
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

59:26.030 --> 59:28.063
who I agreed with you all
was the bottom.

59:28.064 --> 59:30.097
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

59:30.100 --> 59:31.867
So I won money
and I might lose a friend,

59:31.868 --> 59:33.635
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

59:33.637 --> 59:35.137
but the girl that I chose...

59:35.138 --> 59:36.638
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

59:38.509 --> 59:40.242
Was Coco.

59:43.180 --> 59:45.881
I'm so sorry.

59:45.883 --> 59:46.799
I'm so sorry, honey.

59:46.800 --> 59:47.716
I'm so sorry.

59:47.718 --> 59:48.617
I'm sorry.

59:48.618 --> 59:49.517
I'm so sorry.

59:52.957 --> 59:56.224
- As it is written,
so it shall be done.

59:56.226 --> 59:58.994
Coco Montrese,
you are an "All Star."

59:58.995 --> 1:00:01.763
- As it is written,
so it shall be done.

1:00:01.765 --> 1:00:04.116
Now sashay away.

1:00:04.117 --> 1:00:06.468
- As it is written,
so it shall be done.

1:00:08.472 --> 1:00:12.274
(applause)

1:00:14.645 --> 1:00:19.114
- Wow. I'm the first
to be sent away

1:00:19.116 --> 1:00:20.099
by a friend and not Ru.

1:00:20.100 --> 1:00:21.083
- Wow. I'm the first
to be sent away

1:00:21.085 --> 1:00:21.934
It's very disappointing,

1:00:21.935 --> 1:00:22.784
- Wow. I'm the first
to be sent away

1:00:22.786 --> 1:00:24.203
but "All Stars"
don't give up.

1:00:24.204 --> 1:00:25.621
- Wow. I'm the first
to be sent away

1:00:28.459 --> 1:00:31.126
- Well, con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:00:31.128 --> 1:00:32.978
You survived
to live another day.

1:00:32.979 --> 1:00:34.829
- Well, con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:00:34.832 --> 1:00:35.965
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1:00:35.966 --> 1:00:37.099
- Well, con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:00:37.101 --> 1:00:38.133
how in the hell are you
gonna love somebody else?

1:00:38.134 --> 1:00:39.166
- Well, con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:00:39.169 --> 1:00:39.818
Can I get an amen
up in here?

1:00:39.819 --> 1:00:40.468
- Well, con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:00:40.471 --> 1:00:41.437
- (all) Amen.
- All right.

1:00:41.438 --> 1:00:42.404
- Well, con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:00:42.406 --> 1:00:43.272
Now let the music play.

1:00:43.273 --> 1:00:44.139
- Well, con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:00:44.141 --> 1:00:45.224
- ¶ Throw your hands up ¶

1:00:45.225 --> 1:00:46.308
- Well, con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:00:46.310 --> 1:00:47.176
¶ Time to get down ¶

1:00:47.177 --> 1:00:48.043
- Well, con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:00:48.045 --> 1:00:49.812
¶ Time to get down,
down, down, down, down ¶

1:00:49.813 --> 1:00:51.580
- Well, con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:00:51.582 --> 1:00:53.599
- I don't know what's next,
but it's not the end of me.

1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:55.617
- Well, con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:00:55.619 --> 1:00:56.768
So it's not the last
you've seen--

1:00:56.769 --> 1:00:57.918
- Well, con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:00:57.921 --> 1:00:59.087
(alarm)
- Whoo, girl.

1:00:59.088 --> 1:01:00.254
- Well, con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:01:00.257 --> 1:01:01.890
Coco, girl, all is not lost.

1:01:01.891 --> 1:01:03.524
- Well, con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:01:03.527 --> 1:01:06.228
So stay thirsty, girl,
'cause it ain't over.

1:01:06.229 --> 1:01:08.930
- Well, con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:01:08.932 --> 1:01:10.048
- Oh.
- You still have a chance

1:01:10.049 --> 1:01:11.165
- Well, con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:01:11.168 --> 1:01:13.936
to return for your revenge.

1:01:13.937 --> 1:01:16.705
- Well, con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:01:16.707 --> 1:01:19.007
(evil laugh)

1:01:19.008 --> 1:01:21.308
- Well, con-drag-ulations,
"All Stars."

1:01:23.047 --> 1:01:24.980
- No way.

1:01:24.982 --> 1:01:25.714
I got a lot to give,

1:01:25.715 --> 1:01:26.447
- No way.

1:01:26.450 --> 1:01:29.051
