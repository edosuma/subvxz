01:25.751 --> 01:27.887
[whooping]

01:27.920 --> 01:30.289
It's game time, shizznit!

01:30.322 --> 01:32.325
-Let's go!
-Now?

01:32.358 --> 01:34.294
Get your shoes on!

01:40.766 --> 01:42.368
-You still haven't told me--
-Shh!

01:42.401 --> 01:44.337
Matt, just tell me
where we're going.

01:44.370 --> 01:46.405
Will you just hurry up?

01:46.438 --> 01:49.309
It's like walking with
a fucking senior citizen.

02:09.728 --> 02:11.797
-Ms. Dillard's place?
-Yup.

02:11.830 --> 02:15.201
Matt, we can't go in there.
Are you crazy? There's fumes!

02:16.835 --> 02:19.305
-Where'd you get that?
-Army Navy Surplus.

02:19.338 --> 02:20.840
They only had one.

02:22.274 --> 02:23.776
-Well, how do you know it works?
-I don't.

02:23.809 --> 02:26.312
That's why you're going in
and I'm keeping watch.

02:26.345 --> 02:28.848
Matt, I'm not going
in that house!

02:28.881 --> 02:30.650
Ten grand.
Think about it.

02:30.683 --> 02:33.319
Think about what
it could do for Ma.

02:33.352 --> 02:37.390
-Why don't you go?
-I'm the oldest.
I made up the plan.

02:37.423 --> 02:39.292
I paid for the mask.
It's on you.

02:41.694 --> 02:43.663
But people take everything
when their homes get tented.

02:43.696 --> 02:45.898
Not when they're 82!

02:45.931 --> 02:48.701
Look, Tom Chowdee got community
service with old folks.

02:48.734 --> 02:50.470
He saw the cash.

02:51.737 --> 02:53.573
She's got Alzheimer's.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.277
Second floor bedroom,
wooden dresser, bottom drawer.

02:58.310 --> 03:00.279
In a candy tin.

03:00.312 --> 03:01.881
Well, I didn't know
there'd be fumes.

03:01.914 --> 03:04.350
You're not a fucking termite,
Joey, you'll be fine.

03:06.986 --> 03:09.289
Cut the tent.
Break a window.

03:18.897 --> 03:21.401
[glass shatters]

04:08.881 --> 04:10.850
Holy shit!

04:17.856 --> 04:20.593
-[panting]
-Give it!

04:24.897 --> 04:27.367
-Whoa.
-Anyone see us?

04:27.933 --> 04:29.068
No.

04:29.101 --> 04:30.469
No. Let's go before they do.

04:30.502 --> 04:32.038
Come on. Let's go!

04:32.071 --> 04:35.842
-I knew you had it in you.
-Sure you did.

04:40.346 --> 04:42.014
-Hey.
-Run. Run!

04:42.047 --> 04:44.550
Hey! You! No!

04:45.517 --> 04:47.987
Get back here! Hey!

04:48.020 --> 04:50.423
[guard] Come here!

04:51.690 --> 04:52.992
Stop!

05:02.801 --> 05:04.504
I can't keep up!

05:08.974 --> 05:11.077
-Oh!
-[thuds]

05:15.848 --> 05:17.383
[panting]

05:17.416 --> 05:19.385
[footsteps approach]

05:24.523 --> 05:25.891
-We lost him.
-No.

05:25.924 --> 05:29.429
[panting] No, he fell...
he fell in like a hole.

05:29.995 --> 05:31.831
I saw him.

05:31.864 --> 05:34.734
-[panting] You said they
didn't have security.
-They don't!

05:34.767 --> 05:36.969
-Then how--
-How do I know?

05:39.772 --> 05:41.974
-Did you say a hole?
-Yeah.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.749
I don't hear anyone
calling for help.

05:49.782 --> 05:51.751
I don't either.

05:52.885 --> 05:54.787
Oh, shit, I lost the gas mask.

05:56.755 --> 05:57.957
You owe me 30 bucks.

06:00.459 --> 06:01.694
What about the man?

06:01.727 --> 06:03.763
What do we do?

06:03.796 --> 06:05.665
Let's get home
and hide the cash.
We don't know what he saw.

06:29.021 --> 06:30.723
You eat too slow.

06:30.756 --> 06:33.393
-You eat too fast.
-Damn straight.

06:36.595 --> 06:39.465
-Use a napkin.
-I'll use your shirt
if I want to.

06:42.801 --> 06:44.570
-So what about--
-No. Don't.

06:46.071 --> 06:47.707
Not where Ma can hear.

06:50.709 --> 06:52.711
Hey, Ma, you can hear us, right?

06:52.744 --> 06:54.447
[woman] Matt? Joey?

06:54.480 --> 06:57.450
Can one of you boys
fetch me a diet soda?

07:08.594 --> 07:11.230
[newscaster on TV]
A developing situation, not
only in downtown Louisville.

07:11.263 --> 07:15.601
But we understand that usually
in the cases where there
is an officer shot,

07:15.634 --> 07:18.137
or there is a need to get
people to emergency care...

07:19.571 --> 07:20.673
Thanks, baby.

07:20.706 --> 07:23.075
[TV continues, indistinct]

07:23.108 --> 07:26.479
-You have a fun day?
-Um, I guess.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.686
Did you eat yet?

07:33.719 --> 07:36.122
-Uh, yeah. Mac and cheese.
-Mm.

07:39.725 --> 07:41.961
Okay, well...

07:41.994 --> 07:44.630
I'll cook you some shrimp
when I feel better.

07:45.197 --> 07:46.866
Maybe a steak.

07:51.203 --> 07:53.706
Oh, what a world.

07:53.739 --> 07:56.609
[newscaster] ...and Smith.
However, according
to court records,

07:56.642 --> 08:00.546
Smith filed a domestic violence
complaint against Gardner
in late May.

08:00.579 --> 08:03.082
On June 6th, the judge
granted an emergency
protection order...

08:16.094 --> 08:18.164
[counting indistinctly]

08:20.098 --> 08:22.935
The guy that was chasing us.
The guard?

08:22.968 --> 08:24.737
Yeah?

08:24.770 --> 08:27.006
I'm not sure he's okay.

08:27.039 --> 08:29.575
I'm pretty sure he, like,
fell in a well or something,
something deep.

08:29.608 --> 08:31.577
-So?
-So shouldn't
we go check on him?

08:31.610 --> 08:33.245
We can't go back there.

08:33.278 --> 08:35.948
When Ms. Dillard gets home,
she'll see she got robbed.

08:35.981 --> 08:37.683
She'll call the cops.

08:39.818 --> 08:42.755
Yeah, but what if he's hurt?

08:42.788 --> 08:44.156
Fuck that man.

08:44.189 --> 08:46.158
-Matt...
-No, come on, say it with me.

08:46.191 --> 08:48.127
Say "Fuck that man."
Count of three.

08:49.061 --> 08:51.964
One, two, three.

08:53.966 --> 08:55.234
Fuck that man.

08:56.335 --> 08:58.004
In your dreams.

10:08.940 --> 10:10.743
Hello?

10:14.713 --> 10:16.816
Anybody down there?

10:21.820 --> 10:22.855
Hello?

10:35.934 --> 10:37.370
Hello?

10:39.705 --> 10:41.373
[man] Hello?

10:41.406 --> 10:43.976
-Hey.
-Oh, thank God!

10:44.009 --> 10:46.812
I thought I
was trapped down here.

10:46.845 --> 10:51.316
I was chasing some kids
and then I fell.
I think I broke my ankle.

10:51.349 --> 10:54.453
You sound young.
I need to get some help.

10:54.486 --> 10:56.855
Can you... can you
tell your parents?

10:56.888 --> 11:00.125
My dad died last year
and my mom's real sick, so...

11:00.158 --> 11:03.229
-Do you have a cell phone?
-No. How far down are you?

11:04.229 --> 11:06.265
I don't know.
Like 20 feet.

11:06.298 --> 11:08.801
Something like that.
I can't climb out.

11:10.035 --> 11:11.470
Look, you don't have a phone?

11:11.503 --> 11:13.305
You already asked me that.

11:15.474 --> 11:18.377
-How old are you?
-I'll be 15 in three months.

11:18.410 --> 11:20.813
Okay. What's your name?

11:23.115 --> 11:24.250
Matt.

11:25.150 --> 11:27.152
Okay. Listen, Matt.

11:27.185 --> 11:29.488
I'm stuck down here,
I cannot get out by myself,

11:29.521 --> 11:31.790
and I'm gonna need you
to call 911.

11:31.823 --> 11:33.425
All right? If you can't do it,

11:33.458 --> 11:35.494
then just have your mom do it,
all right?

11:35.527 --> 11:37.362
What's your name?

11:37.395 --> 11:40.199
Hamby. H-A-M-B-Y.

11:40.232 --> 11:44.436
Uh, Dave Hamby, but everyone
just called me Hamby

11:44.469 --> 11:48.273
since high school
'cause there were three other
Daves in the class.

11:48.306 --> 11:52.878
But, listen,
you call 911, okay?

11:52.911 --> 11:55.013
Okay. I'll call. I mean,
I'll have my mom call.

11:55.046 --> 11:58.517
Okay. Good.
Good, that's great.

11:58.550 --> 12:00.285
Oh, that's good.
Thanks so much.

12:00.318 --> 12:03.522
This is scary stuff, you know?

12:03.555 --> 12:07.326
Yeah. Um, I'm gonna
get you some help, all right?

12:08.226 --> 12:09.461
Okay. Great.

12:09.494 --> 12:11.097
Great. Thank you.

12:12.097 --> 12:14.200
I'm not going anywhere.

12:21.006 --> 12:23.175
[video game sound effects]

12:26.077 --> 12:29.214
Matt. The guard,
he's still in that hole.

12:29.247 --> 12:31.283
-His name's Mr. Hamby.
-That's a dumb name.

12:31.316 --> 12:33.152
He's stuck
and he needs our help.

12:33.185 --> 12:34.453
Why? So he can arrest us?

12:35.954 --> 12:37.356
You didn't tell him
who you are?

12:37.389 --> 12:39.525
No. I didn't let him see me.

12:39.558 --> 12:42.861
-Fuck, I'm getting killed.
-Matt, we can't
just leave him there.

12:42.894 --> 12:44.330
Someone will hear him
if he yells loud enough.

12:46.264 --> 12:49.935
[sighs] But...

12:49.968 --> 12:52.104
-Oh, fuck!
-Wake up.

12:52.137 --> 12:53.505
What are you... [moans]

12:53.538 --> 12:57.342
We stole 12,600 bucks
from Ms. Dillard.

12:57.375 --> 12:59.178
Do you wanna get busted?

12:59.211 --> 13:01.580
[video game ends]

13:01.613 --> 13:03.883

Hey.

13:10.021 --> 13:12.457
Hey. Don't cry.

13:12.490 --> 13:15.194
We pulled off
the perfect crime.

13:16.361 --> 13:18.564
If that guard sees you,
it's over.

13:22.133 --> 13:24.469
You're the one who went
in Ms. Dillard's house.
Not me.

13:24.502 --> 13:27.473
-Because you told me to!
-Well, you still did it.

13:28.273 --> 13:30.242
Robbery's a felony.

13:30.275 --> 13:32.244
They'll charge you
as a grown-up.

13:34.012 --> 13:35.347
You know what?

13:35.380 --> 13:37.583
If you don't help me
get him out of that hole,

13:37.616 --> 13:40.219
I'm gonna tell Mr. Hamby
exactly who we are!

13:44.322 --> 13:46.992
-Stop!
-No, you're not!

13:47.025 --> 13:49.495
We need that money
for Mom's medical bills.

13:51.663 --> 13:55.968
-Matt, stop!
-[Mother] Guys!
No fighting in the house!

13:56.935 --> 13:58.470
We're just playing around, Ma.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.875
You flinched.

14:06.444 --> 14:08.981
We can't leave him
to die, Matt!

14:10.282 --> 14:14.086
If... if you don't help me out,

14:14.119 --> 14:15.955
I'm gonna tell Ma everything.

14:19.691 --> 14:22.527
-You don't have the balls.
-Oh, yeah?

14:22.560 --> 14:25.430
You're the oldest, Matt.
She knows you push me around.

14:25.463 --> 14:26.899
You'll get in the most trouble.

14:29.634 --> 14:31.403
Fuck.

You're such a girl.

14:34.506 --> 14:37.376
We need to help him.

14:37.409 --> 14:39.078
We could take him some water.

14:41.179 --> 14:42.314
Fine.

14:46.184 --> 14:47.620
We don't show our faces.

14:56.728 --> 14:58.697
You made this whole thing up,
didn't you?

14:58.730 --> 15:00.432
I'm telling you,
he was in the hole.

15:00.465 --> 15:02.100
Yeah? He better be,
‘cause if he's not...

-See?

-Hey. Mr. Hamby? It's me.
-[Hamby] Oh!

15:09.975 --> 15:12.278
Hey, you're back.
Did you bring the police?

15:13.511 --> 15:16.281
They're on their way.

I brought you some water.

Why would you do that?

It's okay!
Thanks. I got it.

15:27.592 --> 15:31.063
We checked on him.
He's fine. Let's go.

He's not fine. He's still stuck.
We need to tell someone.

15:35.567 --> 15:37.336
Is someone up there with you?

15:37.369 --> 15:39.304
No. It's just me.

Oh. Yeah. Come closer.

15:42.307 --> 15:45.510
-I want to see you.
-Yeah. Sure.

What did you say your name
was again? Matt?

15:47.779 --> 15:51.516
-You told him my name?
-It just slipped out!

15:51.549 --> 15:53.652
I can hear you talking
to somebody up there.

15:53.685 --> 15:55.487
-No. I said I was alone.
-Yeah, but you're not.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.356
I can hear you.
It's another boy.

You're the two kids
I was chasing.

16:10.268 --> 16:12.304
Yeah, there's someone
else here all right.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.743
My name is David Hamby,
and I need your help.

16:20.378 --> 16:22.381
What are you two, brothers?

16:22.414 --> 16:24.082
[Matt] What's it to you?

16:24.115 --> 16:26.651
Look, I'm not gonna snitch.
Okay?

16:26.684 --> 16:28.487
I don't care what you guys
were up to.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.722
What do you think
we were up to?

16:30.755 --> 16:34.059
Playing tag? I don't know.
I'll say whatever you want.

16:36.327 --> 16:38.063
How do we know
you'll keep your word?

16:38.096 --> 16:40.232
Look, I was a kid once too,
all right?

16:40.265 --> 16:41.500
I know what it's like.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.670
Let me and my brother talk.

16:45.703 --> 16:48.607
Hey. We can save him.
We can do this.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.742
I bet he saw you sneaking
out of Ms. Dillard's house.

16:50.775 --> 16:53.345
Twenty years in jail.
Think about it.

16:53.378 --> 16:56.114
Let's tell Ma, okay?
This is too big for you and me.
She'll know what to do.

16:56.147 --> 16:57.649
We can't tell Ma we robbed
Ms. Dillard. Are you nuts?

16:57.682 --> 16:59.451
-[Hamby] Guys?
-Shut up!

16:59.484 --> 17:01.086
We're still talking.

17:01.119 --> 17:02.554
Let's just make
an anonymous phone call.

17:02.587 --> 17:04.689
There's a payphone
on Quigley at the 7-11.

17:04.722 --> 17:06.758
Mr. Hamby will sing like
Tweety Bird when he's safe.

17:06.791 --> 17:09.161
But, Matt, he knows our faces.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.596
It'll be worse if someone else
helps him and we don't.

17:11.629 --> 17:14.366
Maybe no one will help him.

17:14.399 --> 17:16.235
That could work too.

17:17.402 --> 17:19.204
Boys, come on, please!

17:19.237 --> 17:21.606
-I said shut up!
-I'm in a lot of pain!

17:21.639 --> 17:23.842
-Goddamn it! Shut up!
-Matt, don't yell at him.

17:23.875 --> 17:26.578
How hard is it to fetch
a grown-up, you stupid brats?

17:26.611 --> 17:29.281
-I'll show you
exactly how hard it is.
-Matt, stop!

17:34.285 --> 17:37.389
-Jesus, Matt!
-No! No! Ah!

17:37.422 --> 17:42.127
Goddamn it! Fuck you!

17:42.160 --> 17:44.163
I'm in charge now,
and I said shut up!

17:45.230 --> 17:46.598
Are you're crazy?
He'll hate us now.

17:46.631 --> 17:47.866
-He already hated us.
-No, he didn't.

17:47.899 --> 17:49.134
Why would you do that?

17:49.167 --> 17:51.503
Because it worked. Listen.

17:55.173 --> 17:57.643
Some people only
understand a harsh hand.

17:59.811 --> 18:01.346
It's like Dad always said.

18:04.182 --> 18:06.184
That man
is someone else's problem.

18:06.217 --> 18:08.387
Not mine, and not yours either.

18:12.557 --> 18:14.526
I'm sorry, Mr. Hamby!

18:41.553 --> 18:46.358
[TV plays indistinctly]

18:55.700 --> 18:58.336
[Mother]
It's cold outside, baby.

18:58.369 --> 19:02.574
-The TV says 43.
-Yeah.

19:02.607 --> 19:05.444
Can you fetch me a diet soda?

19:06.344 --> 19:07.679
Sure, Ma.

19:10.815 --> 19:13.719
What's wrong? Are we out?

19:15.587 --> 19:17.722
-No.
-Oh, good.

19:17.755 --> 19:20.492
Could you fetch me
a glass with some ice too?

19:20.525 --> 19:22.594
Yeah.

19:25.230 --> 19:28.266
-[TV continues indistinct]
-[sighs]

19:28.299 --> 19:29.668
What a world.

19:46.451 --> 19:48.187
Mr. Hamby?

19:48.920 --> 19:50.622
It's me. The nice one.

19:52.357 --> 19:55.360
My real name's Joey.
Matt's my brother.

19:57.395 --> 19:58.931
I brought you some food.

20:01.633 --> 20:04.469
Mr. Hamby. Are you asleep?

20:11.476 --> 20:13.879
Your brother
pissed on my face.

20:14.846 --> 20:17.482
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

20:19.984 --> 20:21.286
I brought you some food, though.

20:21.319 --> 20:23.855
I brought a bologna sandwich,

20:23.888 --> 20:26.992
uh, chips and a soda pop.

20:27.025 --> 20:28.594
Okay. Toss it down.

20:37.001 --> 20:39.238
Does your brother
know you're here?

20:41.039 --> 20:43.642
Yeah. I didn't think so.

20:50.014 --> 20:52.917
So, Joey, are you gonna help me?

20:52.950 --> 20:55.254
Seems like we
got a standoff here.

20:56.321 --> 20:58.823
Yeah. You know, um,

20:58.856 --> 21:00.725
my brother doesn't trust you.

21:00.758 --> 21:02.694
He thinks that you're
gonna get us in trouble.

21:02.727 --> 21:07.966
Well, you don't have to do
everything your brother says.

21:07.999 --> 21:10.402
-How old is he?
-Seventeen.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.737
-And you're what, 15?
-In three months.

21:12.770 --> 21:15.674
Well, you're old enough
to stand up to him.

21:20.545 --> 21:22.047
You seem like a good kid.

21:23.715 --> 21:26.318
You go to church, Joey?

21:26.351 --> 21:27.752
I mean,
I don't get there every Sunday.

21:27.785 --> 21:30.055
But you believe in God, right?

21:32.056 --> 21:35.927
-Yeah.
-Yeah, so do I.

21:35.960 --> 21:39.331
That's why you gotta
do the right thing.

21:39.364 --> 21:41.600
You gotta do
the Christian thing.

21:43.434 --> 21:46.071
Oh, God!

21:48.072 --> 21:50.875
Oh, my leg
hurts something awful.

21:50.908 --> 21:52.778
I can get you some
of my mom's painkillers.

21:54.011 --> 21:55.947
I can't stay down here forever.

21:56.881 --> 21:59.017
I know. I just...

21:59.050 --> 22:01.953
-I need some time to think.
-Think about what?

22:01.986 --> 22:05.724
No, you gotta take charge.
Gotta step up.

22:06.524 --> 22:08.360
I know. I should.

22:10.528 --> 22:14.333
Are you more afraid of your
brother than you are of God?

22:16.701 --> 22:18.870
I was afraid of my brother.

22:18.903 --> 22:21.773
He once kicked a basketball
in my face, broke my nose.

22:21.806 --> 22:23.608
That sounds like
something Matt would do.

22:23.641 --> 22:25.110
[chuckles]

22:25.143 --> 22:26.845
You have a sister?

22:26.878 --> 22:30.849
No. Just me and Matt. You?

22:30.882 --> 22:32.951
I had one.

22:33.918 --> 22:35.554
She died in a car wreck.

22:38.723 --> 22:41.626
-You love your mom, Joey?
-Of course.

22:42.593 --> 22:44.429
Yeah.

22:44.462 --> 22:46.031
I love my mom too.

22:47.765 --> 22:51.636
But, if you leave me
to die down here,

22:53.070 --> 22:54.706
how's she gonna feel?

22:54.739 --> 22:56.775
She'd be sad, I guess.

22:56.808 --> 22:58.377
Real sad.

23:00.711 --> 23:04.049
She'd be all alone,
except for my brother,

23:05.716 --> 23:08.453
and we've already determined
he's kind of an asshole.

23:08.486 --> 23:10.722
-[chuckles]
-[laughs]

23:11.856 --> 23:14.492
See, Joey? Help me out.

23:14.525 --> 23:17.962
Don't let the assholes win.

23:17.995 --> 23:21.166
I was so scared of you
at first, though.
When you were chasing us.

23:21.199 --> 23:24.002
I know, I was scared too.

23:24.035 --> 23:27.639
-I didn't think there
was anyone else around.
-Me neither.

23:30.074 --> 23:34.512
Hey. You know, if you don't want
to call a policeman,

23:34.545 --> 23:36.815
is there another
grown-up you could call?

23:39.784 --> 23:42.787
Or maybe you just get a rope

23:42.820 --> 23:47.959
and I could pull myself out,
you know,
if you tied it to a tree.

23:47.992 --> 23:49.961
I don't think that's
a good idea. Not yet.

23:51.195 --> 23:53.765
-You know, I gotta go.
-No!

23:54.265 --> 23:55.834
I mean, wait.

23:55.867 --> 23:58.236
Please. I...

23:58.269 --> 24:00.972
-I like talking to you.
-I'll be back tonight.

24:01.005 --> 24:03.775
I'll bring you a dinner
and some... some blankets.

24:03.808 --> 24:06.845
-Okay. Call someone.
-I will.

24:08.145 --> 24:11.049
Joey? Joey?

24:13.684 --> 24:15.987
Joey!

24:25.129 --> 24:27.265
[Joey] I think they're
taking the tent off.

24:27.298 --> 24:31.269
I want to see if they
notice the broken window

24:31.302 --> 24:33.004
and if they call the cops.

24:35.773 --> 24:38.009
[Matt] Guess they're
leaving it on longer.

24:38.042 --> 24:41.146
They sometimes do that
if the infestation's bad.

24:42.547 --> 24:45.917
Matt?
Do you believe in God?

24:49.153 --> 24:51.589
Sure I do.

24:51.622 --> 24:54.092
Me and God made a deal
just after Dad was killed.

24:57.194 --> 25:00.131
God goes his way
and I go mine.

25:33.364 --> 25:36.001
[animal calls]

25:40.938 --> 25:43.308
-Mr. Hamby?
-Joey!

25:43.341 --> 25:45.043
I didn't think you'd come back.

25:45.876 --> 25:47.012
I said I would.

25:47.878 --> 25:49.848
Here. Look.

25:51.215 --> 25:52.684
I brought you some stuff.

26:05.363 --> 26:07.299
Did you call anybody yet?

26:08.366 --> 26:10.268
Uh, almost.

26:10.301 --> 26:13.772
But, uh, look.
I brought you something warm.

26:15.172 --> 26:16.741
I also brought you more food.

26:16.774 --> 26:19.177
And some pain pills
for your ankle.

26:22.847 --> 26:25.116
Thanks!

26:25.149 --> 26:29.621
Plus, I got a way for us
to communicate with each other
when I'm not here.

26:29.654 --> 26:31.856
-A cell phone?
-Something better.

26:33.324 --> 26:34.826
My dad gave it to me.

26:34.859 --> 26:36.761
-Catch?
-Okay.

26:37.728 --> 26:39.664
Oh!

26:39.697 --> 26:43.835
It's got a 20-mile range. It's
got a whole GPS and everything.

26:43.868 --> 26:45.336
I got the other one in my room.

26:45.369 --> 26:48.239
-Does your brother
know about it?
-No!

26:48.272 --> 26:49.907
Okay, good. Don't tell him.

26:49.940 --> 26:51.342
You can't call out on it.

26:51.375 --> 26:53.378
It's got a set frequency,
one channel,

26:53.411 --> 26:56.314
so you can only talk to me.
No one else.

26:58.282 --> 27:00.151
[sighs]

27:03.120 --> 27:05.824
Well, thanks for taking
such good care of me, Joey.

27:06.824 --> 27:08.960
You're welcome.

27:08.993 --> 27:11.196
[animals yelping]

27:16.267 --> 27:18.370
You got a wife and kids,
Mr. Hamby?

27:20.938 --> 27:23.408
I used to, Joey.

27:23.441 --> 27:25.009
What happened?
You got divorced?

27:25.042 --> 27:27.946
You could say that.

27:29.413 --> 27:31.850
Life takes some funny turns.

27:35.219 --> 27:37.422
You're gonna rescue me
in the end.

27:38.222 --> 27:40.392
You'll see.

27:41.292 --> 27:43.294
Kindness always wins out.

27:43.327 --> 27:46.131
Yeah. Maybe.

27:48.999 --> 27:51.836
All right, have a good night,
Mr. Hamby.

27:55.406 --> 27:57.676
Good night, Joey.

28:14.959 --> 28:16.928
-Where you been?
-Nowhere.

28:16.961 --> 28:19.864
Oh, yeah? What's nowhere
like these days?

28:23.367 --> 28:25.036
And why you got a flashlight?

28:26.303 --> 28:27.438
I was looking for toads.

28:27.471 --> 28:29.173
Oh, yeah? Did you find any?

28:29.206 --> 28:30.875
-Naw.
-Good.

28:30.908 --> 28:32.877
'Cause you haven't got a bucket

28:32.910 --> 28:34.145
to put 'em in, you liar.

28:35.312 --> 28:37.716
You were out at the hole,
weren't you?

28:39.517 --> 28:41.986
-Visiting that man.
-No.

28:43.954 --> 28:45.857
Sure you were.

28:47.391 --> 28:49.260
Maybe I'll go out
there again, huh?

28:50.561 --> 28:53.064
Drop a big old deuce
on his head this time.

28:53.097 --> 28:54.899
I wasn't there, I swear.

28:58.302 --> 29:02.207
If you get busted,
you're gonna ruin everything.

29:06.977 --> 29:08.880
We need the cash for Ma.

29:10.948 --> 29:13.217
I'm gonna turn it
into money orders.

29:13.250 --> 29:15.787
-Pay off the hospital debts.
-I know.

29:18.389 --> 29:20.124
Don't you even care
about Ma anymore?

29:20.157 --> 29:22.360
-How can you say that?
-I'll say what I want!

29:25.029 --> 29:27.198
I'm the man of the house
since Dad's gone.

29:27.231 --> 29:29.000
Don't forget it.

29:33.304 --> 29:35.940
-Call me Daddy.
-Fuck off, Matt!

29:55.860 --> 30:00.464
[rock music plays on radio]

30:00.497 --> 30:02.400
Come in, Mr. Hamby? Over.

30:04.134 --> 30:06.604
Mr. Hamby, do you copy? Over.

30:06.637 --> 30:09.907
-[Hamby] Copy.
-Oh, this is so cool.
This is so cool!

30:09.940 --> 30:13.311
Um, okay, I'm back at home.
Are you okay?

30:13.344 --> 30:16.180
Are the pain pills
helping yet? Over.

30:16.213 --> 30:18.382
Pain pills can't fix
a broken ankle.

30:18.415 --> 30:21.219
You have to say "over,"
or it doesn't count. Over.

30:22.119 --> 30:24.622
-Over.
-All right.

30:24.655 --> 30:27.024
Well, take two
I think every six hours.

30:27.057 --> 30:29.160
Um, but more
could hurt your liver.

30:29.193 --> 30:32.029
That's good to know, Joey.
Over.

30:32.062 --> 30:35.066
All right, I'll be back
in the morning to bring you
some more stuff. Over.

30:35.099 --> 30:38.837
Bring me something waterproof,
okay? The sleeping bag
is already wet.

30:41.038 --> 30:42.440
And I need toilet paper.

30:42.473 --> 30:44.909
-Over.
-[laughs]

30:44.942 --> 30:50.648
This is awesome. This reminds me
the time I went camping
with my dad in Murfreesboro.

30:50.681 --> 30:53.484
We used to talk to each other
like this in the tents.

30:53.517 --> 30:55.219
He was gonna teach me
how to hunt.

30:55.252 --> 30:57.889
-Over.
-Well, that's great, Joey.

30:59.089 --> 31:01.425
Yeah, my daddy used
to take me hunting.

31:01.458 --> 31:04.095
Taught me how to dress
and hang a buck.

31:04.128 --> 31:06.931
I bet you loved
your dad a whole lot.

31:06.964 --> 31:12.136
Yeah. I did...
when he was sober.

31:12.169 --> 31:16.140
You know what?
We both keep forgetting

-To say "over." [laughs] Oops.

-[knock on door]
-[Mother] Joey,
are you talking to someone?

31:23.180 --> 31:25.449
-Good night, Mr. Hamby.
-Joey! What about--

31:25.482 --> 31:27.919
-[music stops]
-Over and out.

31:35.960 --> 31:38.997
-[gags]
-I found that
for you last night.

31:42.266 --> 31:44.302
-God, you're disgusting.
-So are you.

31:45.970 --> 31:48.673
I know you're bringing food
to that man. Don't deny it.

31:48.706 --> 31:52.110
Okay. So? What if I am?

31:54.345 --> 31:56.414
-You got a crush on him?
-Do you?

31:56.447 --> 31:58.082
You talk about him more
than I do.

31:59.450 --> 32:02.153
I want to come with you today
when you go see him.

32:12.296 --> 32:13.698
[Joey] I don't understand you.
Why are we back?

32:13.731 --> 32:14.966
[Matt] I need
something else from inside.

32:14.999 --> 32:16.300
Are you serious?

32:16.333 --> 32:17.435
Like a cottonmouth
on a ball sack.

32:17.468 --> 32:18.569
Matt, we don't
have the gas mask.

32:18.602 --> 32:20.371
I'm not going back
in that house!

32:20.404 --> 32:22.206

I'll go inside this time.

32:31.215 --> 32:33.284
You're crazy. Matt!

32:33.317 --> 32:34.686
Come on!

32:38.389 --> 32:39.424
Matt!

32:44.695 --> 32:49.166
-Matt!
-[coughing, spits]

32:49.199 --> 32:51.602
-Jesus Christ.
-Nothing can hurt me.

32:51.635 --> 32:53.371
Don't you know that by now?

32:56.206 --> 32:57.708
I don't understand you, Matt!

32:57.741 --> 32:59.710
All these pieces kept floating
around in my head,

32:59.743 --> 33:02.646
waiting to become an idea.
My brain's kinda funny that way.

33:02.679 --> 33:04.749
What are you talking about?

33:04.782 --> 33:09.020
-Holy shit. Oh, God! Stop!
-Catch me if you can, boy!

33:09.053 --> 33:12.423
Mr. Hamby! Mr. Hamby!

33:13.457 --> 33:15.326
Mr. Hamby, look out!

33:19.129 --> 33:20.598
Matt!

33:23.534 --> 33:25.470
Get off me!

33:27.137 --> 33:28.572
Joey?

33:28.605 --> 33:31.342
-The gas will kill him!
-It's for the best!

33:31.375 --> 33:34.445
-I know he saw what we did!
-Ah!

33:36.513 --> 33:38.449
Joey? [groaning]

33:39.650 --> 33:41.552
Joey!

33:41.585 --> 33:43.721
-You'll be a murderer!
-Someone's gotta do something!

33:43.754 --> 33:44.822
[Hamby] What's going on?

33:44.855 --> 33:46.724
You're a monster!

33:46.757 --> 33:48.326
Don't!

33:49.426 --> 33:50.628
Don't, please!

33:52.463 --> 33:54.165
You'll thank me when it's done.

33:55.132 --> 33:57.268
-[shouts]
-[clatters]

33:58.635 --> 34:00.304
Mr. Hamby!

34:01.738 --> 34:03.274
Mr. Hamby!

34:03.307 --> 34:06.611
[groaning]

34:09.880 --> 34:11.148
[Hamby coughing]

34:11.181 --> 34:14.085
-Mr. Hamby!
-[groans]

34:17.488 --> 34:19.690
[Joey coughs, sobs]

34:22.626 --> 34:24.228
[coughing]

34:24.261 --> 34:26.797
-It's over. Let's go.
-No! Mr. Hamby!

34:26.830 --> 34:28.799
It's over. Let's go!

34:28.832 --> 34:30.535
[grunting]

34:32.736 --> 34:34.238
Listen to me.

34:34.271 --> 34:36.707
Listen.

34:36.740 --> 34:39.176
If you ever come back here
to check on him...

34:39.209 --> 34:42.847
-[gagging]
-...then I'll throw you down
that hole too, you understand?

34:42.880 --> 34:47.585
I'll kill you too,
right down that hole.

34:47.618 --> 34:51.322
I'll pour some gasoline on you
and light you up like a candle.

34:51.355 --> 34:53.257
Boom!

34:54.491 --> 34:56.828
They'll never find your body.

34:58.162 --> 35:01.099
Nod once if you understand.

35:07.604 --> 35:11.342
I'm strong as iron
and twice as mean.

35:11.375 --> 35:14.312
Don't tell a soul
what you saw here today.

35:15.679 --> 35:17.615
We're going home.

35:48.845 --> 35:51.582
Mr. Hamby? Over.

35:54.518 --> 35:57.421
Mr. Hamby? Over.

36:02.626 --> 36:04.896
Mr. Hamby. Over!

36:12.569 --> 36:15.273
[sobbing] Mr. Hamby. Over.

36:17.708 --> 36:20.511
Mr. Hamby? Over.

36:20.544 --> 36:22.647
Mr. Hamby?

36:30.420 --> 36:33.724
You boys are quiet today.

36:33.757 --> 36:36.327
Not getting along?

36:37.327 --> 36:38.429
No, we're good.

36:42.532 --> 36:45.436
-Joey?
-I'm fine.

36:45.469 --> 36:46.971
I'm just tired.

36:51.441 --> 36:53.544
[sighs] The news is back on.

36:59.983 --> 37:03.387
So I booked a room
at the Red Carpet Inn tonight.

37:03.420 --> 37:05.623
Gonna go party with
Tom Chowdee and some girls.

37:08.825 --> 37:11.862
You can come if you want.
Peace offering.

37:14.031 --> 37:15.032
Tom's got beers.

37:15.065 --> 37:17.635
-Pass.
-Oh, yeah?

37:17.668 --> 37:20.304
I don't want to go anywhere
with you ever again.

37:20.337 --> 37:21.505
Good.

37:22.906 --> 37:24.909
I didn't want you
to come anyway.

37:27.611 --> 37:29.380
Ah!

37:29.413 --> 37:31.815
-Clean up on aisle pussy.
-You know what? Maybe I will go.

37:31.848 --> 37:33.384
Especially if you
don't want me to.

37:33.417 --> 37:35.953
Party starts at nine.

38:06.650 --> 38:10.788
[indistinct chatter]

38:28.572 --> 38:29.940
-Hey there, bud.
-What's up, Tom?

38:29.973 --> 38:32.343
-You know, Matt's upstairs.
-All right.

38:32.376 --> 38:35.646
-Hey, take a hit.
-No, I don't... I'm good.

38:35.679 --> 38:37.414
Do it.

38:37.447 --> 38:40.718
-Is this your first time?
-No.

38:44.888 --> 38:46.924
-[coughing]
-[laughs]

38:46.957 --> 38:50.861
-[continues coughing]
-Hey, you're all right
by me, bud.

38:50.894 --> 38:52.696
Nice work
on Ms. Dillard's place.

38:52.729 --> 38:55.899
-Matt told me everything.
-He did?

38:55.932 --> 39:00.104
[coughs] Of course he did.
Who do you think is paying
for this party?

39:00.137 --> 39:02.740
It ain't me.
I'm stone broke.

39:09.980 --> 39:14.485
-[loud rock music plays]
-[indistinct chatter]

39:23.059 --> 39:24.428
You came!

39:27.063 --> 39:28.933
Now drink like a fish.

39:30.467 --> 39:31.668
Matt, who's paying
for all this?

39:31.701 --> 39:33.670
What the fuck
does it matter?

39:33.703 --> 39:35.939
You're paying for it, aren't
you, with the money we stole?

39:35.972 --> 39:38.409
-For a stupid party?
-Naw.

39:40.043 --> 39:41.645
Well, maybe a little.

39:41.678 --> 39:43.046
You said the money
was for Ma's medical bills.

39:43.079 --> 39:44.882
There's enough to go around.

39:44.915 --> 39:47.017
-Not if you waste it all.
-What, you got an MBA now?

39:47.050 --> 39:50.053
-We owed Tom Chowdee
for the tip.
-This isn't about Tom Chowdee.

39:50.086 --> 39:53.056
This is about girls and pot
and beer and you.

39:53.089 --> 39:56.126
And there's something
wrong with that?

39:56.159 --> 39:59.797
Joey, we are gonna
have an amazing time.

39:59.830 --> 40:02.966
-Jesus!
-He ain't here, Joey.

40:02.999 --> 40:06.904
You said the money was for Ma.
It was never for Ma.

40:06.937 --> 40:08.739
It was always for you.

40:10.207 --> 40:12.009
That's not fair!

40:12.042 --> 40:14.011
Why you gotta bitch and moan?

40:14.044 --> 40:16.180
Don't you like having fun?

40:18.682 --> 40:20.618
You know where to find me.

40:23.887 --> 40:26.523
She gives head for 20 bucks.
I'll sponsor you.

40:26.556 --> 40:28.659
-Get the fuck off me!
-What's the matter, you gay?

40:28.692 --> 40:32.730
Hey, it's cool. I won't tell.
Dad would be so proud of you.

40:34.231 --> 40:37.201
Matt, you're an idiot
and you're a liar.

40:37.234 --> 40:40.537
And you're gonna
get us both caught.
Dad would regret your existence.

40:40.570 --> 40:42.973
Well, Dad's gone,
so I'm all you got left.

40:43.006 --> 40:45.109
You're worse than nothing.

40:51.181 --> 40:52.783
Okay, listen up, everyone!

40:52.816 --> 40:55.486
Music off! Music off!

40:55.519 --> 40:57.154
[shuts off music]

40:58.522 --> 41:01.058
Okay, listen. Listen.

41:01.091 --> 41:04.228
I got something I wanna say
and it'll only take a sec.

41:04.261 --> 41:07.030
This here's my
baby brother, Joey.

41:07.063 --> 41:09.066
I love my brother,
did you know that?

41:09.099 --> 41:11.535
I'm not even sure that
he knows that, but it's true.

41:11.568 --> 41:13.070
-[girl] Aw.
-But guess what, everyone?

41:13.103 --> 41:15.939
I just heard a story
that my brother

41:15.972 --> 41:18.208
has been robbing from old folks.

41:18.241 --> 41:21.011
What do you think about that?
A dirty thief. My own brother.

41:21.044 --> 41:23.146
[all booing]

41:23.179 --> 41:25.949
-Matt, shut up.
-I heard he's been robbing

41:25.982 --> 41:27.885
from old ladies
who ain't even home!

41:27.918 --> 41:31.121
-Shut up, damn it.
-[booing]

41:31.154 --> 41:33.790
Better get stepping.
Nobody likes a thief.

41:33.823 --> 41:36.126
-[boy 1] Little thief!
-[boy 2] You better
get out of here.

41:36.159 --> 41:40.063
-[all shouting]
-Why don't we show him
what we think of thieves!

41:40.096 --> 41:42.833
He's tougher than that.
He can take more than that.

41:43.700 --> 41:45.669
[all shouting]

41:46.770 --> 41:48.138
Matt killed somebody!

41:48.171 --> 41:50.774
Matt killed a man!

41:50.807 --> 41:52.609
And nobody knows it but me.

41:52.642 --> 41:54.678
His name was Mr. Hamby!

41:55.211 --> 41:57.180
David Hamby!

41:57.213 --> 41:59.683
And Matt killed him.

41:59.716 --> 42:01.185
Matt killed him with poison gas!

42:03.720 --> 42:06.557
-[farting sound]
-Now that's some poison gas!

42:06.590 --> 42:08.258
[all laugh]

42:08.291 --> 42:10.794
I'm serious.
I swear, I saw him.

42:11.928 --> 42:13.297
I saw it.

42:23.707 --> 42:26.076
[groaning]

42:36.886 --> 42:39.756
-Matt, what the fuck?
-Why the fuck would you
say that about me?

42:39.789 --> 42:42.192
Huh? A killer?

42:43.326 --> 42:46.196
I didn't ask
to be put in charge.

42:46.229 --> 42:48.031
-I'm just trying
to have a good time.
-No, you're not!

42:48.064 --> 42:50.000
You're trying
to get me in trouble!

42:50.033 --> 42:51.635
You're trying to frame me for
robbing Ms. Dillard's place!

42:51.668 --> 42:54.271
You're such an ungrateful
fuckin' dick!

42:54.304 --> 42:55.839
Aren't you?

42:58.108 --> 43:00.611
-Matt, stop!
-Pretty easy
to get hurt out here.

43:00.644 --> 43:02.980
You wanna be careful
spreading rumors.

43:03.013 --> 43:05.082
As soon as I get home,
I'm gonna tell Ma everything!

43:08.752 --> 43:11.221
You're not telling Ma.

43:11.254 --> 43:13.123
Think about the consequences.

43:13.156 --> 43:14.691
Huh?

43:14.724 --> 43:17.361
Ma being so frail and all.

43:18.762 --> 43:20.898
Bad things happen
to weak people.

43:21.898 --> 43:23.934
Just look at Dad.

43:26.436 --> 43:29.773
Ah, fuck! [groans, sobs]

43:29.806 --> 43:31.275
Get up, Joe.

43:33.209 --> 43:35.746
I said get up.

43:35.779 --> 43:37.314
Look at what
you've done now, hm?

43:37.347 --> 43:39.149
-[sobbing]
-Hm?

43:39.182 --> 43:40.951
You should face it.

43:42.385 --> 43:44.788
I'll always
be one step ahead of you.

43:46.156 --> 43:49.726
[whooping]

43:49.759 --> 43:51.228
Whoo!

43:52.962 --> 43:55.833
-Ahh!
-[yelps]

44:04.074 --> 44:06.276
[door opens]

44:06.309 --> 44:07.778
-[door slams]
-Joey, can you--

44:07.811 --> 44:10.047
Get your own damn soda!

44:10.947 --> 44:13.384
Someone's in a mood.

44:17.887 --> 44:19.990
I wasn't even gonna
ask you for a soda.

44:20.023 --> 44:22.359
I was... just gonna say,

44:22.392 --> 44:26.229
"Can you come and sit
down a spell?" But...

44:26.262 --> 44:28.899
maybe you need to be left alone.

44:46.416 --> 44:48.385
Are you okay, baby?

44:49.986 --> 44:51.255
Yeah.

44:53.123 --> 44:58.028
-Matt's giving you grief again,
isn't he?
-No.

44:58.061 --> 45:00.197
He hasn't been the same
since Daddy died.

45:00.230 --> 45:03.233
Sure he has, Mom,
but it's just gotten worse.

45:06.803 --> 45:09.173
I don't have the strength
to deal with him.

45:10.440 --> 45:12.810
[sighs]
Not like a mother should.

45:13.810 --> 45:15.279
That's okay, Ma.

45:17.514 --> 45:20.117
You know,
as bad as your daddy was...

45:22.552 --> 45:25.355
some days I wish
he was still here.

45:40.870 --> 45:43.040
I'm sorry, Joey.

45:46.242 --> 45:48.345
I know, Ma.

45:51.080 --> 45:55.352
If you ever need to talk...

45:56.252 --> 45:57.954
here I am, okay.

45:57.987 --> 45:59.757
You know that, right?

46:00.356 --> 46:02.059
Yeah.

46:06.930 --> 46:08.799
Look.

46:10.233 --> 46:14.805
-A murderer's on the loose.
-A murderer?

46:14.838 --> 46:16.907
Yeah, they've been
showing his face all day.

46:16.940 --> 46:21.478
He shot his wife
and kids in Raleigh.

46:21.511 --> 46:23.346
He was spotted around here.

46:23.379 --> 46:26.316
"Armed and dangerous"
is what they say.

46:28.084 --> 46:30.086
He doesn't have
the jaw line of a killer,

46:30.119 --> 46:33.557
but you can never tell
until it's too late.

46:35.225 --> 46:38.428
His name
is Randy Michael Sadler.

46:38.461 --> 46:40.197
Holy shit!

46:40.230 --> 46:43.367
He shot his whole family.
Blew their brains out.

46:44.367 --> 46:47.204
I guess he just snapped,

46:47.237 --> 46:49.173
like people do.

46:50.607 --> 46:51.942
Baby?

46:52.909 --> 46:54.177
-Holy shit.
-Baby!

46:54.210 --> 46:56.213
I wasn't trying to scare you.

46:56.246 --> 46:58.281
I just want to keep you safe.

46:58.314 --> 47:02.352
Fuck! Holy fuck.
Holy fuck. Holy shit.

47:04.220 --> 47:05.889
Jesus!

47:05.922 --> 47:07.891
Jesus! Jesus!

47:07.924 --> 47:10.828
[static on walkie]

47:13.162 --> 47:15.833
[static on walkie]

47:17.533 --> 47:19.569
[Hamby] Joey.

47:19.602 --> 47:22.272
Joey. Are you there?

47:22.305 --> 47:24.875
Over.

47:37.086 --> 47:38.989
Mr. Hamby?

47:39.022 --> 47:43.126
[Hamby]
You forgot to say... "over."

47:45.995 --> 47:48.966
You're... you're alive?

47:49.565 --> 47:51.134
Over.

47:51.167 --> 47:53.370
[Hamby] Your brother...

47:53.403 --> 47:56.973
Was that... poison?

47:57.006 --> 47:59.643
From Ms. Dillard's
termite house.

48:00.510 --> 48:03.346
My lungs hurt...

48:03.379 --> 48:05.649
and my eyes aren't right.

48:05.682 --> 48:07.517
It's time.

48:07.550 --> 48:09.319
Get me out of here.

48:10.353 --> 48:12.222
No more excuses.

48:13.256 --> 48:17.561
-Mr. Hamby?
-Yeah?

48:19.395 --> 48:21.298
I know who you really are.

48:26.569 --> 48:28.105
Joey...

48:29.472 --> 48:31.375
Come see me in the morning.

49:04.774 --> 49:06.510
How come you're still alive?

49:12.715 --> 49:15.552
You dropped this
when I was chasing you.

49:20.256 --> 49:22.058
You saved my life.

49:22.091 --> 49:24.761
Why were you chasing us?
You're gonna hurt us?

49:24.794 --> 49:27.230
I saw you robbing the place.

49:27.263 --> 49:29.333
I was gonna take what you stole.

49:31.267 --> 49:33.403
Things didn't
go according to plan.

49:33.436 --> 49:36.306
So I guess I should call you
Randy from now on.

49:38.574 --> 49:40.110
Hey, Joey.

49:42.445 --> 49:44.414
How did your dad die?

49:45.248 --> 49:46.449
I never asked you.

49:46.482 --> 49:49.486
-He got shot.
-Shot?

49:52.288 --> 49:55.125
He was drunk and, um,

49:55.158 --> 49:58.294
messed with the wrong person.

49:58.327 --> 50:01.498
He had cancer anyway.
Lung cancer. [sniffs]

50:01.531 --> 50:03.200
My mom got it too.

50:04.567 --> 50:07.237
Tough draw.

50:07.270 --> 50:09.639
Both my folks died
in a car wreck.

50:09.672 --> 50:11.208
Just like your sister?

50:13.476 --> 50:15.112
Yeah.

50:16.679 --> 50:18.181
Just like her, Joey.

50:18.214 --> 50:20.150
You never even
had a sister, did you?

50:25.321 --> 50:26.723
Why didn't you ever
tell me your real name?

50:26.756 --> 50:29.126
Same reason you
didn't tell me yours.

50:30.793 --> 50:32.596
So is it true?

50:35.364 --> 50:37.501
You know, what they said
about you in the news?

50:39.469 --> 50:42.672
Well, it probably went down

50:42.705 --> 50:44.641
a little different
than they said it did.

50:44.674 --> 50:48.144
Why'd you want me to call
the cops? There's a manhunt.

50:48.177 --> 50:50.047
Well, maybe I had a plan.

50:52.448 --> 50:55.185
They said that you...
you killed your family.

50:56.486 --> 51:00.223
Your wife and your two kids,
eight and ten.

51:00.256 --> 51:02.659
Then you burned your house down.

51:02.692 --> 51:04.794
What do you think
about that, Joey?

51:04.827 --> 51:06.563
[Joey] Why were you wearing
a security guard outfit?

51:06.596 --> 51:10.366
They say you work
at a tire factory.

51:10.399 --> 51:12.836
[chuckles]
How about that?

51:12.869 --> 51:14.671
A tire factory.

51:14.704 --> 51:17.274
Why can't you just
give me a straight answer?

51:19.308 --> 51:22.846
Maybe I ran into a security
guard and stole his clothes.

51:24.147 --> 51:26.516
Desperate men
do desperate things.

51:27.750 --> 51:30.487
So do you still want me
to call the cops?

51:30.520 --> 51:32.322
Oh...

51:32.355 --> 51:35.625
It's a bit more challenging
now that I'm all over the news.

51:37.360 --> 51:39.596
But if you were to get a rope,

51:39.629 --> 51:42.432
I wouldn't say no.

51:42.465 --> 51:45.168
Tie it to a tree.
I could climb out.

51:46.469 --> 51:47.704
You know, I could turn you in.

51:47.737 --> 51:49.306
I bet there's big reward money.

51:50.540 --> 51:52.375
I bet there is.

51:53.776 --> 51:56.279
But you're not gonna do that,
are you, Joey?

52:02.652 --> 52:04.254
[groans]

52:06.722 --> 52:08.425
Now, go get that rope.

52:09.692 --> 52:12.228
There's a rope in the garage.
I can get it.

52:12.261 --> 52:13.863
Good man.

52:13.896 --> 52:17.600
Bring it here quick.
We're running out of time.

52:17.633 --> 52:19.236
First I got a question.

52:20.236 --> 52:22.405
Actually, it's more of a...

52:22.438 --> 52:23.773
a favor than a question.

52:23.806 --> 52:26.709
-Hit me.
-If I get you that rope

52:26.742 --> 52:29.179
and help you out...

52:32.815 --> 52:35.318
will you come back to the house
and punish Matt for me?

52:37.453 --> 52:39.623
-Joey?
-Yes, Randy?

52:41.357 --> 52:43.260
It would be my delight.

52:48.631 --> 52:51.634
[indistinct shouting]

52:51.667 --> 52:54.771
All you do pop pills
and watch TV all day!

52:54.804 --> 52:57.407
Don't you rag my ass
about how I live!

52:57.440 --> 52:59.576
[sobbing]
I'm worried about you!

52:59.609 --> 53:02.378
The manager of Red Carper Inn
called and said...

53:02.411 --> 53:04.314
Screw that guy, he's lying!

53:04.347 --> 53:06.516
-...you and Tom Chowdee...
-I've never been in that dump!

53:06.549 --> 53:08.552
-...threw a party
and wrecked a room.
-Hey, Matt!

53:09.452 --> 53:10.987
Mom!

53:11.020 --> 53:13.856
[Mother] Go up to your room.
Lock the door.

53:13.889 --> 53:15.858
Stop talking about me
like I'm not even in here!

53:15.891 --> 53:17.860
He's been stealing
my pain pills too.

53:17.893 --> 53:20.630
-No, you're fuckin' lying!
-Matt, stop!

53:20.663 --> 53:22.832
-Not my TV!
-Matt, Matt, Matt!

53:22.865 --> 53:26.669
Okay, I was taking
your pain pills. That was me,
I was taking them.

53:26.702 --> 53:28.738
-What? You?
-That was me.

53:30.273 --> 53:32.542
You? Why?

53:32.575 --> 53:35.278
-I... I was bored.
-Why?

53:35.311 --> 53:37.314
-Time for rehab.
-Shut up!

53:39.715 --> 53:42.586
[sobbing] I feel so helpless
with you boys.

53:43.419 --> 53:45.688
[sobbing] Baby, can...

53:45.721 --> 53:48.558
-Can you get me a diet soda?
-Sure, Ma.

53:51.560 --> 53:53.396
You two make me sick.

53:54.297 --> 53:56.633
Baby. Ma! Baby. Ma!

53:57.767 --> 54:00.403
-Fuck it.
-[clattering]

54:00.436 --> 54:02.239
I hate this place.

54:04.507 --> 54:06.843
I'll get you that soda, Ma.

54:06.876 --> 54:09.412
I'm helping you clean up, okay?

54:34.036 --> 54:38.375
-Here, baby. [groans]
-It's okay, Ma.

55:22.518 --> 55:24.787
-[Randy] That you, Joey?
-Yeah, I got the rope.

55:24.820 --> 55:27.557
Okay. Good man.

55:27.590 --> 55:28.991
[Joey] Yeah,
this might take a while.

55:29.024 --> 55:32.562
That's okay.
Take your time and do it right.

55:33.496 --> 55:35.431
Tie it around the nearest tree.

55:35.464 --> 55:37.700
Do you know how
to make a clove hitch?

55:37.733 --> 55:40.937
-My dad taught me.
-All right.
Make sure it's tight.

55:40.970 --> 55:43.773
It's got to support
all of my weight.

55:43.806 --> 55:46.009
-Oh, it'll hold.
-Okay.

55:55.651 --> 55:59.589
-Okay, here it comes.
-All right. There we go.

55:59.622 --> 56:03.360
Good. Come on. Little further.

56:04.727 --> 56:05.895
Got it!

56:08.431 --> 56:10.100
All right, Joey, stand back.

56:12.101 --> 56:15.505
[grunting]

56:23.579 --> 56:27.083
[panting, grunting]

56:27.116 --> 56:29.386
Pull me up. Pull me up.

56:34.690 --> 56:37.827
[moans, sighs]

56:38.994 --> 56:40.563
Oh, wow.

56:44.033 --> 56:47.837
Get me a branch for a cane.

56:47.870 --> 56:51.007
-Otherwise I'm no good
for walking.
-Okay.

56:51.040 --> 56:53.877
[sighs, pants]

56:56.078 --> 56:58.148
I forgot what freedom was.

57:04.086 --> 57:06.689
[groans]

57:11.193 --> 57:13.596
Okay. Help me up.

57:14.730 --> 57:16.599
[moans] Okay.

57:19.835 --> 57:22.071
-You okay?
-Yeah.

57:23.873 --> 57:24.874
Ow!

57:27.676 --> 57:30.180
[sighs, pants]

57:32.081 --> 57:34.784
-Sorry about this, Joey.
-Sorry about what?

57:39.622 --> 57:41.458
[panting]

57:42.858 --> 57:46.596
Randy? Have you had that gun
in the hole the entire time?

57:46.629 --> 57:48.898
It didn't do me
much good in the hole.

57:50.065 --> 57:51.935
Different story outside.

57:53.969 --> 57:57.006
Are... are you gonna shoot me?

58:02.011 --> 58:03.213
Nah.

58:08.617 --> 58:10.820
Here. [sniffs]

58:10.853 --> 58:11.988
You take it.

58:12.021 --> 58:13.723
I don't want it.
I don't want it.

58:13.756 --> 58:15.492
You might like the feel.

58:18.193 --> 58:20.863
I wish I had two.

58:20.896 --> 58:22.665
I'd take you hunting.

58:23.165 --> 58:24.834
Teach you.

58:25.701 --> 58:27.203
Like your daddy wanted.

58:29.738 --> 58:31.107
Go on, then.

58:32.775 --> 58:36.779
-Is it loaded?
-It's loaded. Safety's off.

58:37.947 --> 58:39.949
You could shoot a man.

58:40.950 --> 58:43.553
[imitates gunshots]

58:47.122 --> 58:49.893
-[imitates gunshots]
-Looks good on you.

59:00.736 --> 59:02.872
Police are looking for you
in five states.

59:04.773 --> 59:06.543
Five states, huh?

59:07.076 --> 59:08.778
That's big.

59:08.811 --> 59:10.947
You shot your family
and that's all you can say?

59:12.681 --> 59:14.784
Sometimes...

59:17.052 --> 59:19.221
That doesn't matter now.

59:19.254 --> 59:20.857
It matters to me.

59:25.060 --> 59:26.996
You better give me
that gun back.

59:40.275 --> 59:42.111
Tell me what you
were going to say.

59:44.279 --> 59:46.316
Sometimes...

59:49.018 --> 59:51.921
you wish you could
go back in time.

59:53.789 --> 59:55.925
Before life knocked
your knees out.

59:59.194 --> 1:00:03.366
-I should shoot you right now.
-Probably so.

1:00:14.176 --> 1:00:15.378
Take your gun.

1:00:19.815 --> 1:00:22.251
Take me to your house.

1:00:22.284 --> 1:00:24.654
I'm gonna need cash and a car.

1:00:26.188 --> 1:00:28.224
And we'll settle
that score with your brother.

1:00:28.257 --> 1:00:31.127
Right.

1:00:31.160 --> 1:00:34.430
Let's just scare him, though,
all right? Don't hurt him.

1:00:34.463 --> 1:00:36.098
Exactly.

1:00:36.131 --> 1:00:39.369
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

1:00:57.286 --> 1:01:00.756
Just let me do
the talking, all right?
She saw you on the news.

1:01:00.789 --> 1:01:02.659
Fair enough.

1:01:04.226 --> 1:01:07.096
-Hey, Ma.
-Baby.

1:01:07.129 --> 1:01:09.966
-Can you fetch me a diet soda?
-Not today.

1:01:20.909 --> 1:01:22.244
You're...

1:01:22.277 --> 1:01:25.247
you're Randy Michael Sadler.

1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:27.984
-From the TV!
-Don't worry.

1:01:28.917 --> 1:01:31.087
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:33.156
Go sit on the couch by your mom.

1:01:35.357 --> 1:01:38.494
-Baby...
-It's okay, Ma. It's okay.

1:01:38.527 --> 1:01:40.429
He's not gonna hurt us.

1:01:40.462 --> 1:01:43.332
-Is Matt home?
-Oh, no, no.

1:01:43.365 --> 1:01:45.068
He's... he's out.

1:01:51.540 --> 1:01:53.776
You take whatever you need
and you get out.

1:01:53.809 --> 1:01:56.178
Just don't hurt my boy.

1:01:56.211 --> 1:01:58.114
Your boys have some money.

1:01:58.147 --> 1:02:00.249
And Joey said there's
a car I can use?

1:02:01.850 --> 1:02:04.353
In the... in the garage.

1:02:05.420 --> 1:02:07.289
Their daddy's old truck.

1:02:07.322 --> 1:02:10.793
All right.
I'll get out of your hair soon.

1:02:10.826 --> 1:02:13.229
-I'm sorry about this, ma'am.
-You should be.

1:02:13.262 --> 1:02:16.799
-Your mom have a cell phone?
-No.

1:02:18.500 --> 1:02:21.337
Grab that phone so
she doesn't call the cops.

1:02:22.504 --> 1:02:24.941
Get me some fresh clothes
and a towel.

1:02:25.808 --> 1:02:27.543
Meet me by the car.

1:02:27.576 --> 1:02:30.179
-Sure, Randy.
-You're on his side?

1:02:31.980 --> 1:02:34.150
-It's complicated.
-Baby!

1:02:34.183 --> 1:02:36.419
Just don't move
'cause he might shoot you.

1:02:38.020 --> 1:02:39.522
Also, you still want
that diet soda?

1:02:39.555 --> 1:02:41.491
Not right now.

1:02:42.057 --> 1:02:43.926
Okay.

1:02:46.128 --> 1:02:48.498
Excuse me,
Officer Friendly?

1:02:50.199 --> 1:02:53.469
-You lost, son?
-No such luck.

1:02:53.502 --> 1:02:57.373
-Well, we're working here.
-I need to talk to you
about Ms. Dillard's place.

1:02:58.841 --> 1:03:00.476
You know something
about that broken window?

1:03:00.509 --> 1:03:02.111
I sure do.

1:03:02.144 --> 1:03:03.579
And it's more
than just a broken window.

1:03:03.612 --> 1:03:05.915
Yeah? Hey, Crane.

1:03:08.050 --> 1:03:09.451
What's going on?

1:03:09.484 --> 1:03:11.554
I saw this kid the other day
sneak into this house,

1:03:11.587 --> 1:03:13.455
right through the termite tent.

1:03:13.488 --> 1:03:16.425
Came out with cash
in both his hands. Boats full.

1:03:16.458 --> 1:03:18.795
What kid?
You know his name?

1:03:20.095 --> 1:03:21.864
His name's Joey.

1:03:23.165 --> 1:03:25.368
He lives in my house. He's...

1:03:27.169 --> 1:03:28.470
Well, he's my little brother.

1:03:28.503 --> 1:03:30.940
-He's your little brother?
-Yes, sir.

1:03:30.973 --> 1:03:33.409
I saw what he stole,
and it was a whole lot.

1:03:35.878 --> 1:03:37.413
I can take you
to the cash if you want.

1:03:37.446 --> 1:03:39.115
You can see for yourself.

1:03:45.487 --> 1:03:48.190
It's really never been driven
since your daddy was shot?

1:03:48.223 --> 1:03:50.893
My ma's got a car,
but Matt never learned how.

1:03:50.926 --> 1:03:53.563
Huh. Well,
I'll tell you one thing.

1:03:54.630 --> 1:03:57.133
Your dad sure
loved this truck.

1:04:00.035 --> 1:04:03.039
-He ever take you riding in it?
-Yeah, sometimes.

1:04:07.109 --> 1:04:09.212
-Randy?
-Yep.

1:04:13.649 --> 1:04:16.352
Can you...
can you take me with you?

1:04:17.653 --> 1:04:19.589
Wherever you're going?

1:04:21.423 --> 1:04:25.027
Yeah. I knew you were
gonna ask me that.

1:04:28.063 --> 1:04:30.199
I'm not planning
on ever coming back here.

1:04:30.232 --> 1:04:32.534
And besides,

1:04:32.567 --> 1:04:35.238
I don't think your mama
would approve.

1:04:36.972 --> 1:04:39.275
Oh, sure she would.

1:04:39.308 --> 1:04:41.610
So I'm the Pied Piper now? Huh?

1:04:41.643 --> 1:04:43.279
[chuckles]

1:04:46.348 --> 1:04:48.284
If you don't take me with you,

1:04:48.317 --> 1:04:50.386
I'll tell the police
everything I know about you.

1:04:50.419 --> 1:04:53.088
Everything.

1:04:53.121 --> 1:04:55.491
Blackmail, huh?
Say it ain't so, Joe.

1:04:55.524 --> 1:04:58.628
-I'm not bluffing!
-[chuckles] I know.

1:05:03.598 --> 1:05:06.035
Why don't you come on
and take a ride with me?

1:05:07.436 --> 1:05:10.172
-[bangs on truck]
-What about Matt? You promised.

1:05:10.205 --> 1:05:14.010
Yeah. We'll find him
along the way. Come on.

1:05:16.411 --> 1:05:18.047
Just up here.

1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:19.916
It's the little
white house on the corner.

1:05:22.617 --> 1:05:24.353
Oh, shit, that's my dad's truck.

1:05:25.988 --> 1:05:28.123
Hey, wait, wait.
Matt's in that cop car.

1:05:28.156 --> 1:05:30.226
Matt's in the back
of that cop car.

1:05:32.027 --> 1:05:34.563
What do we do?
What do we do?

1:05:37.299 --> 1:05:39.936
[laughs]

1:05:41.703 --> 1:05:45.041
Uh... you got me.

1:05:49.611 --> 1:05:51.614
-We're gonna be all right, Joey.
-How?

1:05:56.218 --> 1:06:00.222
Just put your fingers in your
ears when the shooting starts.

1:06:00.255 --> 1:06:03.592
The shooting? The cops might
not know who you are, Randy!

1:06:03.625 --> 1:06:07.029
-Wait, wait, wait. You, you--
-Stay in the car.

1:06:07.062 --> 1:06:09.098
Fingers in your ears.

1:06:15.504 --> 1:06:18.040
-Shit. It's Mr. Hamby
from the hole.
-[Crane] The hole?

1:06:18.073 --> 1:06:20.042
This kid don't
make a lick of sense.

1:06:20.075 --> 1:06:23.179
-No, you don't understand.
-I gotta check it out.

1:06:25.213 --> 1:06:27.583
-How you doing, officer?
-Fucking car. Fuck!

1:06:27.616 --> 1:06:30.085
-Let me out of this
fuckin' car right now!
-[Crane] Calm down!

1:06:30.118 --> 1:06:32.087
-What is wrong with you?
-Can I help you with something?

1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:33.655
If you don't mind, I'd like to
ask you a couple of questions.

1:06:33.688 --> 1:06:36.025
-Oh, yeah.
-I have a guy in the back...

1:06:36.058 --> 1:06:37.326
No! Gun!

1:06:41.730 --> 1:06:43.299
Let me out of this fuckin' car!

1:06:46.068 --> 1:06:47.770
We don't have to do this!

1:06:47.803 --> 1:06:49.572
There's kids around!

1:06:51.506 --> 1:06:53.442
-I recognize you!
-I figured you would.

1:06:53.475 --> 1:06:55.478
Put down the gun!
I gotta take you in!

1:07:00.215 --> 1:07:01.517
Get off the street!

1:07:03.752 --> 1:07:05.454
Randy, you shot that cop.

1:07:05.487 --> 1:07:09.258
He'll be okay.
He just got to get doctored up.

1:07:11.326 --> 1:07:13.829
-That's my brother in your car!
-I said get back inside!

1:07:13.862 --> 1:07:16.832
You heard the lady.
That's good advice.

1:07:16.865 --> 1:07:19.502
[Crane] Put down the gun
or I'll shoot!

1:07:22.404 --> 1:07:25.207
-Jesus Christ, move!
-Hey, hey, hey! Wait!

1:07:25.240 --> 1:07:27.776
You're not gonna take Randy.
All right?
You're not gonna hurt him!

1:07:27.809 --> 1:07:29.645
-Get out of the--
-[gunshot]

1:07:36.651 --> 1:07:37.686
Stay down!

1:07:40.455 --> 1:07:42.358
I'm not worth it.

1:07:42.858 --> 1:07:44.660
Promise.

1:07:53.702 --> 1:07:55.371
[Joey] Randy?

1:08:00.542 --> 1:08:03.179
If you weren't here,
they'd be dead.

1:08:05.514 --> 1:08:07.216
Take it.

1:08:11.386 --> 1:08:14.590
[Matt shouting, banging]
Let me the fuck out of here!

1:08:17.192 --> 1:08:20.729
Let me out of this fuckin' car.
Unlock this fuckin' door, Joey.

1:08:20.762 --> 1:08:23.666
Unlock the fuckin' door
right now!

1:08:26.234 --> 1:08:30.472
Ma'am, I'm gonna
need your car keys.

1:08:30.505 --> 1:08:31.640
[Matt] Shit!

1:08:34.442 --> 1:08:38.147
All right, Matt,
climb on in.

1:08:38.180 --> 1:08:40.883
Joey, get that rope,
toss it in the hole.

1:08:42.250 --> 1:08:44.186
The cops are gonna kill you!

1:08:44.219 --> 1:08:46.455
I don't see any cops
around here. Do you?

1:08:47.322 --> 1:08:49.525
Joey. Joey, look at me.

1:08:59.534 --> 1:09:00.769
Bang!

1:09:00.802 --> 1:09:02.371
You flinched.

1:09:10.946 --> 1:09:13.849
Get going, Matt. Go on.

1:09:16.284 --> 1:09:18.487
-How do I get down?
-Jump.

1:09:31.600 --> 1:09:33.402
Fuck!

1:09:38.006 --> 1:09:41.277
-Ah! Fuck! [groans]
-[thuds]

1:09:42.777 --> 1:09:45.514
Ow! I hate your guts, Joey!

1:09:45.547 --> 1:09:47.282
[laughs]

1:09:47.315 --> 1:09:49.485
So what do we do now?

1:09:50.452 --> 1:09:52.321
Now?

1:09:52.354 --> 1:09:54.456
Now is your big chance.

1:09:54.489 --> 1:09:57.993
-To do what?
-To show him that things
have changed.

1:09:58.026 --> 1:09:59.928
That you rule the roost now.

1:09:59.961 --> 1:10:01.530
I rule the roost?

1:10:01.563 --> 1:10:03.832
Don't tell me. Tell him.

1:10:07.636 --> 1:10:10.505
-I rule the roost, Matt.
-Like hell you do!

1:10:10.538 --> 1:10:11.907
Come on, louder.

1:10:11.940 --> 1:10:13.508
Put some muscle
behind it, Joey!

1:10:13.541 --> 1:10:16.979
-I rule the roost!
-Go fuck yourself!

1:10:17.012 --> 1:10:18.647
Louder!
He's laughing at you!

1:10:20.582 --> 1:10:22.451
I rule the roost!

1:10:22.484 --> 1:10:24.453
Look at you! You're nobody!

1:10:24.486 --> 1:10:26.989
You're as dumb as a brick
and everybody knows it!

1:10:27.022 --> 1:10:28.890
You're dead meat when I get
out of here. You hear me?

1:10:28.923 --> 1:10:30.626
Tell him things
are different now.

1:10:30.659 --> 1:10:32.527
You're not gonna
eat his shit anymore.

1:10:32.560 --> 1:10:35.998
He's not the boss anymore!
That you're the man now!

1:10:36.031 --> 1:10:39.668
-I'm the man now!
-You're the man now!

1:10:39.701 --> 1:10:43.572
I'm the boss to you!
You're down there!
I'm up here! All right?

1:10:43.605 --> 1:10:45.841
I'm the boss!
[panting]

1:10:48.910 --> 1:10:51.614
[chuckles]

1:10:55.717 --> 1:10:58.520
-Hand that over.
-I like the feel of that.

1:10:58.553 --> 1:11:01.624
Yeah. I thought you would.

1:11:04.559 --> 1:11:06.395
But... [clears throat]

1:11:07.629 --> 1:11:09.365
I got some bad news.

1:11:10.665 --> 1:11:12.000
What?

1:11:12.033 --> 1:11:13.869
There's only one place
for you to go.

1:11:13.902 --> 1:11:15.938
Where?

1:11:19.641 --> 1:11:22.644
Down... down there?

1:11:22.677 --> 1:11:24.313
Where else?

1:11:24.346 --> 1:11:27.383
Ha! Send him down to me!
Yeah, send him down!

1:11:28.750 --> 1:11:30.085
I can't. I can't go
down there.

1:11:30.118 --> 1:11:31.853
He'll kill me.

1:11:31.886 --> 1:11:34.690
Yeah. That's how
it goes sometimes.

1:11:34.723 --> 1:11:39.061
Or else you learn
to stand up to him and fight,

1:11:39.094 --> 1:11:40.996
teach him to respect you.

1:11:41.029 --> 1:11:43.799
But he's all riled up.
You made me say those things.

1:11:43.832 --> 1:11:47.035
No. Those things were
inside of you already.

1:11:47.068 --> 1:11:52.040
I can't go down there.
I won't, I can't,
there's no way.

1:11:52.073 --> 1:11:54.677
Okay. Fair enough.

1:11:56.544 --> 1:11:58.080
-Ah!
-[shouts]

1:12:00.048 --> 1:12:01.383
Matt! Matt! Matt!

1:12:01.416 --> 1:12:03.886
-[grunting]
-Matt!

1:12:19.401 --> 1:12:21.370
[grunting]

1:12:25.940 --> 1:12:29.078
[muffled sounds]

1:12:48.596 --> 1:12:50.532
[Mother] You.

1:12:58.206 --> 1:12:59.842
Drop your gun.

1:13:11.886 --> 1:13:13.422
Is that all of them?

1:13:23.231 --> 1:13:25.768
How'd you find me?

1:13:33.908 --> 1:13:35.911
[scoffs] GPS.

1:13:35.944 --> 1:13:37.479
[chuckles] Shit.

1:13:38.513 --> 1:13:40.549
Better than a cell phone.

1:13:41.783 --> 1:13:43.051
Where are my boys?

1:13:43.084 --> 1:13:44.786
I had to give them a time out.

1:13:44.819 --> 1:13:47.923
They're in a hole
not far from here.

1:13:47.956 --> 1:13:51.626
-Take me there.
-There's no need.

1:13:51.659 --> 1:13:53.962
You can hear 'em.

1:13:55.129 --> 1:13:56.498
Listen.

1:13:56.531 --> 1:13:58.700
[indistinct shouting]

1:13:58.733 --> 1:14:00.802
Get up!

1:14:00.835 --> 1:14:04.072
Come on, I said get up!
Fight me!

1:14:04.105 --> 1:14:05.974
Fight me!

1:14:14.048 --> 1:14:15.717
Joey.

1:14:16.184 --> 1:14:17.819
Mister.

1:14:17.852 --> 1:14:21.857
They say you shot your family.

1:14:21.890 --> 1:14:23.592
And I saw you shoot those cops.

1:14:24.192 --> 1:14:26.028
I can't let you go.

1:14:28.763 --> 1:14:30.799
I've known men like you.

1:14:31.699 --> 1:14:33.568
Violent men.

1:14:33.601 --> 1:14:35.070
My husband was one of 'em.

1:14:36.304 --> 1:14:39.674
Someone shot him, Joey says.

1:14:39.707 --> 1:14:45.113
Someone who got fed up
with his drinking,

1:14:45.146 --> 1:14:47.549
who got fed up
with getting hit,

1:14:48.550 --> 1:14:52.220
who got lung cancer

1:14:52.253 --> 1:14:55.657
from his cigarette smoke
when he wouldn't quit.

1:14:59.294 --> 1:15:01.163
Shit!

1:15:02.163 --> 1:15:03.866
Joey?

1:15:09.270 --> 1:15:11.173
Joey?

1:15:12.840 --> 1:15:15.610
Joey, you okay?

1:15:15.643 --> 1:15:17.779
I haven't been there
for my boys.

1:15:19.714 --> 1:15:21.884
But I'm here right now.

1:15:23.318 --> 1:15:25.687
Anything I could say
to get out of this?

1:15:27.121 --> 1:15:29.057
We could wait for the cops.

1:15:30.291 --> 1:15:33.962
Nah, they'll just drag it out.

1:15:38.967 --> 1:15:42.204
Don't let those boys down. Okay?

1:15:45.206 --> 1:15:47.175
[groaning]

1:16:18.206 --> 1:16:20.142
Joey?

1:16:20.808 --> 1:16:22.277
Joey, Joey.

1:16:22.310 --> 1:16:24.145
Joey!

1:16:24.178 --> 1:16:26.615
You okay, Joey? Fuck!

1:16:26.648 --> 1:16:28.083
Wake up, Joey.

1:16:28.116 --> 1:16:31.053
Joey, wake up, please.
Please, Joey.

1:16:33.221 --> 1:16:36.124
Joey! Joey!

1:16:39.394 --> 1:16:40.662
[sobbing] Please, Joey.

1:16:40.695 --> 1:16:43.832
Joey, I'm sorry! No!

1:16:43.865 --> 1:16:46.267
[sobbing] Wake up, Joey!

1:16:46.300 --> 1:16:48.203

You're okay. You're okay.

You're okay!

1:17:04.018 --> 1:17:06.321
You're okay.

1:17:07.355 --> 1:17:09.391
I'm so sorry, Joey.

1:17:09.424 --> 1:17:11.259
I'm so sorry.

1:17:12.860 --> 1:17:16.031
I did so many bad things.
I'm sorry, Joey.

1:17:17.331 --> 1:17:19.000
It's okay.

1:17:19.033 --> 1:17:22.137
You were right.
This was too big for you and me.

1:17:22.170 --> 1:17:24.306
I just wanted
to take care of things.

1:17:25.907 --> 1:17:29.378
I didn't know how!
I'm sorry.

1:17:30.878 --> 1:17:33.048
You're all I have.

1:17:34.182 --> 1:17:36.084
[Mother] Matt!

1:17:37.752 --> 1:17:39.721
Where are you?

1:17:40.888 --> 1:17:42.324
Joey!

1:17:43.224 --> 1:17:45.126
-Boys!
-Ma!

1:17:45.159 --> 1:17:46.895
Ma! Ma, help!

1:17:48.429 --> 1:17:51.299
Ma, help, we're down here!

Ma! Ma, help!

[gasping]

1:17:55.803 --> 1:17:57.372
Ma, we need help!

1:17:57.405 --> 1:18:00.709
-Thank God! My boys!
-Ma!
