WEBVTT

00:23.875 --> 00:25.875
[wondrous music playing]

00:42.541 --> 00:43.625
[birds chirping]

00:54.875 --> 00:56.708
-[man laughing]
-[indistinct chatter]

00:56.791 --> 00:58.416
[woman] Okay. Tell me what you're tasting.

00:59.291 --> 01:02.625
[man] Cherry, raspberry,

01:03.333 --> 01:05.291
and what is that?

01:05.375 --> 01:07.291
[cutlery clinking]

01:07.375 --> 01:08.583
Spice and tobacco.

01:08.666 --> 01:10.708
-Exactly. You nailed it.
-Ah.

01:10.791 --> 01:13.083
It's a red burgundy, but to me,

01:13.166 --> 01:15.125
it's a passport to a travel experience.

01:15.208 --> 01:19.416
You know, I'm suddenly transported
to a chateau garden outside of Dijon

01:19.500 --> 01:20.791
on a warm Autumn day.

01:20.875 --> 01:22.708
[both chuckling lightly]

01:22.791 --> 01:24.125
Smart of you to fly up.

01:24.208 --> 01:26.416
Mythos Wines was almost off my list.

01:26.500 --> 01:29.250
Speaking of, I'm so sorry
the previous wine rep went MIA.

01:29.333 --> 01:31.333
I will personally handle
your account from now on.

01:31.416 --> 01:32.875
Good. Stay for lunch.

01:32.958 --> 01:35.291
Hand-torn pasta with porcini and herbs.

01:35.375 --> 01:37.833
Oh. You're evil. I wish.

01:37.916 --> 01:41.666
I have to catch a flight
back to L.A. in… oh, now.

01:41.750 --> 01:45.375
When are you gonna stop
racing around California 24/7,

01:45.458 --> 01:46.916
putting out fires for your boss?

01:47.000 --> 01:48.541
Ugh, Calder's not that bad.

01:49.375 --> 01:50.833
[scoffing] Okay. Yeah, he is.

01:50.916 --> 01:53.833
He's terrible, but I'm angling
for Regional Sales Director.

01:53.916 --> 01:56.666
I would like to see
Lola Alvarez running her own show,

01:56.750 --> 01:59.416
with her own wine import company.

01:59.500 --> 02:03.208
So, just got back from my Sydney house.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.125
[Lola] Uh-huh.

02:05.583 --> 02:08.625
Tried some new wines by Hazel Vaughn.

02:08.708 --> 02:11.083
-Oh, Hamish, no, not another--
-[Hamish] I know. I know.

02:11.166 --> 02:14.000
Another Fortune 500 CEO
with a vanity wine label.

02:14.916 --> 02:16.083
Just try it.

02:17.791 --> 02:20.833
It's a pétillant naturel wine.

02:20.916 --> 02:22.291
The ancient technique.

02:22.375 --> 02:23.208
[Lola] Ooh.

02:23.291 --> 02:25.208
Bubbles before it's bottled.

02:25.291 --> 02:27.833
Mm-hmm. Hazel doesn't have a US importer.

02:28.916 --> 02:32.041
If you get Mythos a contract
for Vaughn Wines,

02:32.125 --> 02:36.125
I'd put it on my list
for all of my restaurants.

02:36.625 --> 02:39.708
[Lola] Well, if Ms. Vaughn's office
isn't available, I'll leave word.

02:39.791 --> 02:41.166
Okay. Are you ready?

02:41.250 --> 02:45.041
-310-555-0143.
-[indistinct chatter]

02:45.125 --> 02:46.458
[whispering] Thanks. Okay.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.208
-Hi. Oh…
-First-Class souvenir.

02:49.291 --> 02:51.541
-I am so jealous of your life.
-[Lola chuckling]

02:51.625 --> 02:53.791
I just ate lunch from the vending machine.

02:54.291 --> 02:55.666
He's on a tear today.

02:56.166 --> 02:57.791
He even made the FedEx lady cry.

02:57.875 --> 02:59.458
Ramona? Who makes Ramona cry?

02:59.541 --> 03:01.541
I know. I've been on the phone
with Kroger all day.

03:01.625 --> 03:04.000
They stocked our Lone Elk Merlot
on the bottom shelf.

03:04.083 --> 03:07.250
Okay. Nobody looks at the grocery store
bottom shelf. Eye-level only.

03:07.333 --> 03:08.375
I got creative.

03:08.458 --> 03:12.541
I traded them a multi-case discount
on Pink Lady Rosé for a better facing.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.208
Daryl from Kroger was all over it.

03:14.291 --> 03:16.041
I'm pretty sure
he thought it was his idea.

03:16.125 --> 03:18.166
Nice work, girl. Love it.

03:18.250 --> 03:20.708
[woman] I took a page
out of the Lola playbook.

03:20.791 --> 03:22.791
[woman chattering indistinctly]

03:24.875 --> 03:26.875
[woman] Remember we love our jobs.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.750
May I remind you
this is a place of business,

03:30.833 --> 03:32.375
not a Chuck E. Cheese?

03:32.458 --> 03:33.666
Oh. [chuckling lightly]

03:35.708 --> 03:36.583
[grunts]

03:38.333 --> 03:40.625
Lola, update me on the King account.

03:40.708 --> 03:44.166
Saved it. And our Burgundy was
successfully added to his wine list.

03:44.250 --> 03:45.833
You know me, go big or go home.

03:45.916 --> 03:47.500
That's why you're my number one.

03:47.583 --> 03:49.916
-If only everyone was as motivated.
-[balloon popping]

03:50.500 --> 03:52.291
[struggling]

03:52.375 --> 03:53.500
-[balloon pops]
-[woman 2] Ow!

03:53.583 --> 03:56.208
I want new ideas at the town hall
tomorrow. No resting on laurels.

03:56.291 --> 03:58.791
Oh, no. I know. I hate laurels. Ugh.

03:58.875 --> 04:00.083
Oh, I'm actually gonna be late.

04:00.166 --> 04:01.958
I finally scored a sit-down
with Wine Barn.

04:02.041 --> 04:05.708
Fine. Just, uh, don't pitch me any
of that all-female Uruguayan

04:05.791 --> 04:07.291
wine collective nonsense again.

04:07.375 --> 04:08.750
I know it's small batch,

04:08.833 --> 04:10.541
but it's these
really incredible women who--

04:10.625 --> 04:13.625
I'm in the wine business,
not the whining business.

04:13.708 --> 04:14.916
[woman] Oh… [chuckling]

04:15.000 --> 04:16.333
[chuckling nervously]

04:19.000 --> 04:20.958
He's gonna fire me.
I can feel it. [clears throat]

04:21.041 --> 04:23.625
-Okay, okay. Deep breaths. Here we go.
-[woman breathing heavily]

04:23.708 --> 04:27.041
[exhaling slowly] Okay, you have an entire
night to find something to pitch.

04:27.125 --> 04:28.583
-[woman] Yeah. Okay.
-Don't worry.

04:28.666 --> 04:30.291
-[cell phone ringing]
-Oh, uh, one second.

04:30.375 --> 04:31.208
[woman] Okay.

04:33.375 --> 04:34.458
Lola Alvarez.

04:34.541 --> 04:35.875
[phones ringing]

04:37.583 --> 04:38.458
A month?

04:39.333 --> 04:42.125
Well, can I schedule a meeting
for when Ms. Vaughn returns?

04:43.291 --> 04:45.625
Yeah, I'll send over materials. Okay.

04:45.708 --> 04:47.750
Great. Sounds good. Speak soon. Thanks.

04:48.250 --> 04:49.333
[whispering] Yes.

04:49.416 --> 04:50.250
That sounded big.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.958
-[Lola chuckling]
-[woman] What's up?

04:53.041 --> 04:53.916
Oh…

04:55.166 --> 04:58.000
Oh. Come on, work wife. Spill. [chuckling]

04:58.083 --> 05:01.291
Okay. Vaughn Family Wines.
Out of Australia.

05:01.375 --> 05:04.125
Started as a celebrity label
made at a custom crush facility.

05:04.208 --> 05:08.166
But now Hazel Vaughn has her own vineyards
and brought in an award-winning winemaker.

05:08.250 --> 05:11.083
What? Sweet find. [chuckling]

05:11.166 --> 05:12.625
Uh, how… how can I help?

05:12.708 --> 05:14.708
Right now,
Hazel's on sabbatical for a month,

05:14.791 --> 05:17.333
so just keep this between you and I
until I get a meeting set.

05:17.416 --> 05:18.500
Okay. [chuckling]

05:18.583 --> 05:20.666
Thanks. Gotta run.

05:20.750 --> 05:24.416
One last client drop-in until I'm facedown
on my couch in sweatpants.

05:24.500 --> 05:25.583
[mouthing]

05:25.666 --> 05:27.666
[contemplative music playing]

05:31.375 --> 05:33.541
-[man laughing loudly]
-[indistinct chatter]

05:35.750 --> 05:37.791
[all laughing]

05:37.875 --> 05:38.708
That's good.

05:42.125 --> 05:43.625
Get on in here.

05:43.708 --> 05:46.083
Made pizzas from scratch.
We got leftovers.

05:46.166 --> 05:47.208
[Lola] Hey, Dad.

05:51.541 --> 05:53.250
Hello.

05:53.750 --> 05:57.625
So, what is the neighborhood book club
pretending to discuss this month?

05:57.708 --> 06:02.458
[laughing] Oh, honey. You know we only
walk over to Carlos's for the free rosé.

06:02.541 --> 06:04.750
Mm. And we are loving this one.

06:04.833 --> 06:06.833
Oh, I can see. You guys work fast.

06:06.916 --> 06:09.500
Mm. Deep gratitude for the wine hookup.

06:09.583 --> 06:12.458
Mm. Speaking of hookups, spill.

06:13.166 --> 06:14.291
Oh. [sighing heavily]

06:14.375 --> 06:17.041
[woman] Come on,
we've already finished the other gossip.

06:17.125 --> 06:17.958
Here we go.

06:18.041 --> 06:21.416
Can't you just discuss my love life
behind my back, like normal people?

06:21.500 --> 06:22.708
-Uh, no.
-[Carlos] No.

06:22.791 --> 06:24.333
-[woman] We can't do that.
-No.

06:24.416 --> 06:25.958
Not our style. No.

06:26.041 --> 06:27.791
How long since that divorce, Lola?

06:27.875 --> 06:29.666
Um, two years.

06:29.750 --> 06:31.375
Why? Who's counting?

06:31.458 --> 06:32.833
-Me.
-[Lola sighing]

06:32.916 --> 06:34.708
Grandkids don't make themselves.

06:34.791 --> 06:36.541
Oh, Dad, really? What?

06:36.625 --> 06:39.208
-Honestly we're gonna go there tonight?
-[woman laughing]

06:39.291 --> 06:40.375
[sirens wailing]

06:40.458 --> 06:43.333
Sweetie, while not subtle,
book club has a point.

06:43.958 --> 06:45.875
Tyler let a damn good thing go.

06:46.458 --> 06:47.958
It's time to move on, like he did.

06:48.541 --> 06:51.458
Tyler didn't turn out to be the person
that I thought he was. Okay?

06:52.125 --> 06:53.791
Not every man is a liar.

06:54.375 --> 06:56.083
Look at me. I'm perfect.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.333
[Lola scoffing]

06:57.416 --> 06:59.750
You always see the best in people.
Don't stop now.

06:59.833 --> 07:00.791
[scoffing]

07:00.875 --> 07:03.416
Your heart got broken,
you pressed pause on your love life.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.708
It's time to press play.

07:05.208 --> 07:07.333
You got to learn to trust again.

07:09.875 --> 07:14.500
I project a year-over-year increase
in sales, placing these wines in…

07:14.583 --> 07:16.416
-[Lola] Excuse me.
-…upscale restaurants…

07:17.083 --> 07:19.625
-Hi.
-[woman] …and specialty bottle shops.

07:19.708 --> 07:23.208
Plus, the Australian government
offers a substantial financial package,

07:23.291 --> 07:24.750
um, to export,

07:24.833 --> 07:26.708
so it's a win-win.

07:26.791 --> 07:27.875
[melancholy music playing]

07:27.958 --> 07:29.333
In summation, Calder,

07:29.958 --> 07:32.833
I have secured you a pitch meeting
four weeks from today

07:32.916 --> 07:35.500
with Hazel Vaughn herself.

07:35.583 --> 07:36.458
[clearing throat]

07:36.541 --> 07:37.666
[Lola scoffing]

07:37.750 --> 07:39.708
Hmm. You got a passport, Audra?

07:39.791 --> 07:41.250
Mm-hmm. Yep.

07:41.333 --> 07:42.833
You're coming to Sydney with me.

07:43.416 --> 07:45.875
Close this deal,
we're talking Regional Sales Director.

07:45.958 --> 07:47.166
-Oh.
-[cell phone ringing]

07:48.166 --> 07:50.833
Uh, short break, everybody.
I gotta take this.

07:53.416 --> 07:54.583
[breathing heavily]

07:55.416 --> 07:56.541
I… I didn't…

07:58.458 --> 08:01.333
Sugar-pops, I got the opera tickets.

08:02.125 --> 08:03.416
[chuckling] Okay, ciao.

08:04.541 --> 08:06.208
Vaughn Family Wines is my find.

08:06.291 --> 08:08.291
Well, Audra pitched it and now it's hers.

08:08.375 --> 08:10.125
Okay, only because I told her about it.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.875
Well, that was
your big mistake now. Wasn't it?

08:13.541 --> 08:15.666
We learn lessons the hard way, Lola.

08:18.791 --> 08:19.708
[Lola sighing]

08:20.666 --> 08:23.291
Lola's up next, everybody. Let's go.

08:23.375 --> 08:25.375
[indistinct chatter]

08:25.458 --> 08:27.333
[man clearing throat, sighing]

08:28.625 --> 08:29.916
[Calder] This should be good.

08:30.500 --> 08:31.833
[Calder clearing throat]

08:33.666 --> 08:34.541
[Lola sighing]

08:35.125 --> 08:35.958
Hmm?

08:36.583 --> 08:37.500
[inhaling sharply]

08:37.583 --> 08:40.541
You know, it's no secret you're not
the most warm and fuzzy boss, Calder.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.291
[employees murmuring]

08:42.375 --> 08:45.125
But hey, I get it.
You know, wine is a tough business,

08:45.208 --> 08:48.000
and I told myself you were setting
a high bar for good reason.

08:48.083 --> 08:51.958
But nope, turns out
you are a garden-variety snob.

08:52.041 --> 08:54.375
-You mistake cruelty for cleverness.
-[employees gasping]

08:54.458 --> 08:57.583
When it comes to wine, you barely know
a Petit Verdot from a Petit Syrah.

08:57.666 --> 08:59.000
You're not fooling anyone.

08:59.083 --> 09:00.458
Don't be emotional, Lola.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.416
If this is about
the Regional Sales Director position--

09:03.500 --> 09:06.166
[chuckling] Audra can have it.
I've been saving your butt for years.

09:06.250 --> 09:07.083
I'm done!

09:07.708 --> 09:09.375
[muttering] What are you doing?

09:09.458 --> 09:11.958
Oh, isn't it obvious? I'm quitting.

09:12.041 --> 09:13.416
[Calder laughing]

09:13.500 --> 09:16.625
Uh, no, you can't leave.
I decide when someone leaves.

09:16.708 --> 09:19.916
Oh. Not today, pal. You fall straight
into the category of "life is too short."

09:20.000 --> 09:23.875
You know what? I would rather sell
margaritas in a can at a suburban 7-Eleven

09:23.958 --> 09:25.500
than work another minute for you.

09:25.583 --> 09:27.041
[employees murmuring]

09:27.750 --> 09:30.583
Bye, hon. Good luck finding
someone else's ideas to steal.

09:33.041 --> 09:33.916
Take care, team.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.875
Oh, and, uh, I have a stash of Girl Scout
cookies in my bottom desk drawer,

09:36.958 --> 09:38.791
so parting gift. [clicking tongue]

09:38.875 --> 09:41.041
-[employees gasping, murmuring]
-[mouthing] Bye.

09:41.125 --> 09:42.041
[ducks quacking]

09:42.666 --> 09:44.583
[birds chirping]

09:44.666 --> 09:46.375
[kid yelling indistinctly]

09:46.458 --> 09:47.791
-Morning.
-Morning.

09:47.875 --> 09:50.333
Oh. Who knew quitting
would be so inspiring?

09:50.416 --> 09:53.750
[inhales deeply] And terrifying.
It's a really interesting combo.

09:53.833 --> 09:55.291
-[laughing]
-[exhaling sharply] Okay.

09:55.375 --> 09:58.916
How is this for my new company logo?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.625
-[man] Wow.
-I sketched it last night.

10:02.208 --> 10:03.541
-[Dad] I love it.
-[Lola] Really?

10:03.625 --> 10:06.375
It's barely day one of your own company
and you're already crushing it?

10:06.458 --> 10:08.166
I'm proud of you, sweetie. It's time.

10:08.250 --> 10:09.208
Use a coaster.

10:09.291 --> 10:10.125
Thanks, Dad.

10:10.208 --> 10:12.625
But so far my company
is just an elaborate doodle

10:12.708 --> 10:14.666
and some lovely Uruguayan ladies.

10:14.750 --> 10:18.750
And with my savings on the line,
I really need a big account ASAP.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.750
I need Vaughn Family Wines.

10:22.833 --> 10:23.875
Uh-oh.

10:23.958 --> 10:25.625
I know this tone of voice.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.708
Hold on to your butts, everyone.

10:27.791 --> 10:28.625
[keyboard clacking]

10:28.708 --> 10:30.416
-Calder's meeting's in four weeks.
-[Dad] Mm.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.833
I did some Internet sleuthing.
That sabbatical Hazel's on?

10:32.916 --> 10:35.708
She spends every year
at her family's sheep farm in Australia.

10:35.791 --> 10:38.000
Like a "stay in touch
with her roots" kinda thing.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.166
Hazel Vaughn's farm also…

10:40.250 --> 10:41.208
[keyboard clacking

10:41.291 --> 10:43.041
…has an Airbnb cottage.

10:44.125 --> 10:47.416
Yeah. I'll rent the cottage,
and pitch my company to Hazel first.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.666
Boom. It's a matter of principle now.

10:50.166 --> 10:52.416
Wow. Australia!

10:52.916 --> 10:54.375
That sounds kind of

10:55.375 --> 10:56.208
far.

10:56.291 --> 10:57.541
Yeah. I know.

10:57.625 --> 10:59.291
Gah. Is this too bold?

10:59.375 --> 11:02.458
I don't know, like,
am I brave or just, like, really crazy?

11:03.041 --> 11:05.666
-[Lola sighing heavily]
-Is your gut telling you to do this?

11:06.708 --> 11:07.625
Yes.

11:08.208 --> 11:09.791
Strangely, it just…

11:10.625 --> 11:12.291
It feels right to me.

11:12.375 --> 11:14.125
["Traveling Song" by Timber Bones playing]

11:14.208 --> 11:18.750
Then I say, let's go a lot of bold
and a little crazy.

11:19.833 --> 11:20.791
[yelling happily]

11:21.291 --> 11:24.333
-I'm going to Australia!
-[both chuckling]

11:24.416 --> 11:26.416
["Traveling Song" continues]

12:08.250 --> 12:09.083
Welcome.

12:10.083 --> 12:12.458
Well, good morning, Australia. Hi.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.000
Let me help you with that.

12:15.583 --> 12:17.000
Thanks. Woah!

12:17.583 --> 12:18.416
[man grunting]

12:18.500 --> 12:20.708
Oh my God. Are you all right?

12:22.333 --> 12:23.375
[breathing heavily]

12:23.458 --> 12:25.166
[chuckling] Gravity.

12:25.250 --> 12:26.208
Oh.

12:26.916 --> 12:27.958
[man exhaling sharply]

12:28.458 --> 12:29.416
[man burping]

12:29.500 --> 12:30.500
I'm all good now.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.375
And time to go.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.333
-[driver] Where to, mate?
-[man] Take me to the pub, my good man.

12:39.666 --> 12:41.208
[birds chirping]

12:47.791 --> 12:49.666
[wondrous music playing]

12:54.000 --> 12:54.875
Hello?

12:56.250 --> 12:57.208
Anyone here?

13:04.875 --> 13:07.625
Hello? Uh, where do I check in?

13:34.208 --> 13:36.166
[Lola gasping]

13:38.333 --> 13:39.416
Wow.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.083
-[man clearing throat]
-Oh!

13:45.166 --> 13:46.333
-[laughing]
-[Lola sighing]

13:46.416 --> 13:47.583
Hi.

13:47.666 --> 13:51.666
Can I help you find something?
Combination to the safe maybe.

13:51.750 --> 13:54.083
Yes. De-- No! No, no, no, no.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.208
No. I'm sorry. No combination needed.

13:56.291 --> 13:57.666
That will not be necessary.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.833
Hi. I, um… I… I booked the Airbnb.

13:59.916 --> 14:02.875
Yeah, I figured.
I've been expecting you. Just not here.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.375
Oh. Weird.

14:04.458 --> 14:07.291
So you're saying that this isn't
the cottage that I rented, huh?

14:07.375 --> 14:08.666
Whoo. Imagine that. [laughing]

14:08.750 --> 14:11.958
All right. If there's nothing else
on your "breaking and entering" agenda,

14:12.041 --> 14:14.708
let me show you
to your slightly more modest lodging

14:14.791 --> 14:16.166
before the boss gets home, okay?

14:16.250 --> 14:18.958
Oh, wait. If by boss
you mean Hazel Vaughn,

14:19.041 --> 14:21.708
could you, um, help a girl get introduced?

14:22.333 --> 14:26.000
Uh, right. That's why
you're snooping around her house.

14:26.583 --> 14:29.416
-Um, not snooping. Sure.
-[man] Come on. Let's go.

14:29.500 --> 14:34.208
Someone like me needs to get creative
to score face time with the Hazel Vaughn.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.375
Come on. Please?

14:36.458 --> 14:38.125
Charm doesn't work on me.

14:38.208 --> 14:40.916
Look, enjoy the cottage.
Take some selfies with the sheep.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.958
Just don't bother Hazel Vaughn.

14:43.041 --> 14:44.875
[man 2] Excuse me. Mate, we got issues.

14:45.458 --> 14:46.375
Miss.

14:46.458 --> 14:49.291
That new jackaroo Peter? He's just quit.

14:49.375 --> 14:50.208
Done.

14:50.291 --> 14:52.791
[sighing heavily] It's not like
that bludger did any work.

14:52.875 --> 14:55.291
I always had to send him off
to sober up under a tree.

14:55.375 --> 14:58.291
Oh, but I saw that guy.
He took my airport van to the pub.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.708
[man 2 chuckling] That sounds about right.

15:00.791 --> 15:03.791
I've been calling everywhere.
No one has any workers to spare.

15:03.875 --> 15:07.958
Not even a bloody backpacker.
Anyway, gotta get back to the sheep.

15:08.458 --> 15:09.291
Righto.

15:11.041 --> 15:12.458
[sighing heavily]

15:12.541 --> 15:14.083
Let's get you situated, right?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.333
[whimsical music playing]

15:27.458 --> 15:29.000
[man] Hey. Stop.

15:30.708 --> 15:33.083
Hi. Hi. Lola Alvarez.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.958
I am very excited
about your wine, Ms. Vaughn.

15:36.041 --> 15:38.541
And since you're only considering
American importers personally,

15:38.625 --> 15:42.166
I figured a self-made lady boss would
appreciate another self-made lady boss--

15:42.250 --> 15:44.083
-Sorry, Hazel. She's--
-Not done talking.

15:44.666 --> 15:46.291
My company, Salud Imports,

15:46.375 --> 15:48.583
is a newly established
California importer--

15:48.666 --> 15:50.916
I've never heard of them. How new?

15:51.583 --> 15:54.916
So far, it's only me. and I'm still
in the process of getting licensed.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.750
-Doesn't that take months?
-[Lola] 60 days.

15:56.833 --> 16:00.208
And I can also guarantee placement
with the world-famous chef Hamish King.

16:00.291 --> 16:02.375
Whoa. Let me stop you right there.

16:02.458 --> 16:04.666
Despite the ambush, I admire your moxie.

16:04.750 --> 16:06.500
And Hamish King
is an impressive name-drop,

16:06.583 --> 16:08.416
so I'll be just as straight
with you in return.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.750
You've clearly done your research.

16:10.833 --> 16:12.708
Vaughn Family Wines is my baby,

16:12.791 --> 16:16.458
so there is absolutely no way
I will go with a first-time importer.

16:17.500 --> 16:18.916
Sorry you wasted an airline flight.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.458
Yeah, look, while I got ya, bad news.

16:21.541 --> 16:23.000
Jackaroo bailed on us today.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.875
-[Hazel] It's shearing season.
-[man] Yeah. Same as neighboring stations.

16:25.958 --> 16:28.208
-Everyone's shorthanded.
-Well, I… I could do it.

16:30.208 --> 16:31.083
Could do what?

16:31.166 --> 16:33.875
The job. I mean, how long
do you need someone? A few days?

16:33.958 --> 16:36.000
About two weeks. Also, no.

16:36.083 --> 16:39.083
Well, why not? I'm here and I'm willing.
I can be your jackaroo.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.166
Yeah, nah. You'd, uh… you'd be a jillaroo.

16:42.250 --> 16:43.791
Gendered terms. Cute. Whatever works.

16:43.875 --> 16:46.291
Look, we need someone
with real station experience,

16:46.375 --> 16:47.916
not an Airbnb tourist.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.666
Look, I came all this way
to show Ms. Vaughn I go the extra mile.

16:51.750 --> 16:53.750
This is the extra mile.

16:54.250 --> 16:56.875
I'm a hard worker.
And I will hit the ground running,

16:56.958 --> 16:59.458
just as I will
when I'm working with your wine.

17:00.583 --> 17:01.500
[inhaling deeply]

17:01.583 --> 17:04.875
Well, a pair of hands is a pair of hands.

17:04.958 --> 17:06.125
If Max here agrees.

17:06.208 --> 17:09.833
He's this station's boss cocky,
so what he says, goes.

17:09.916 --> 17:12.875
You will never have to send me off
to sober up under a tree.

17:13.375 --> 17:14.375
I pay attention.

17:14.958 --> 17:16.333
[birds chirping]

17:18.333 --> 17:21.166
[scoffing] I can't believe
it's come to this.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.875
-[Hazel] Looks like your lucky day.
-[grunts happily]

17:23.958 --> 17:26.916
And since my sabbatical
always includes endless work calls,

17:27.000 --> 17:30.166
Max here will be in charge of training you

17:30.750 --> 17:31.666
starting today.

17:31.750 --> 17:32.791
Today?

17:33.375 --> 17:35.958
No. I can't spend the next two weeks
babysitting some newbie.

17:36.041 --> 17:37.916
[Hazel] That's busy farm life for you.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.458
-Yeah, Tim can do it.
-The person I trust is you.

17:46.000 --> 17:46.916
[scoffing]

17:47.708 --> 17:49.208
I hope you're worth the trouble.

17:49.791 --> 17:52.208
Lola Alvarez, give us all you've got.

17:52.916 --> 17:56.125
If you pass muster at mustering,
then we can talk wine.

17:57.291 --> 17:58.291
Deal.

17:58.875 --> 17:59.708
Thank you.

18:01.041 --> 18:01.916
[whispering] Yes.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.291
[exhaling sharply]

18:05.375 --> 18:06.541
[sighing heavily]

18:06.625 --> 18:08.000
Might as well get started then.

18:08.875 --> 18:09.750
[upbeat music playing]

18:09.833 --> 18:12.541
-Wait, like, right now?
-No time like the present.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.291
Well, I mean, Don't I need
to drop my bag off at the cottage first?

18:15.375 --> 18:18.500
Leave it. And no more cottage.
Workers stay in the shearers' quarters.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.333
Well, I… I mean, I can't just leave
my bag here. What if it gets stolen?

18:22.416 --> 18:24.708
We're 200 kilometers away from anything.

18:24.791 --> 18:25.958
Who's gonna steal it?

18:26.458 --> 18:28.750
Wait. What? Uh…

18:28.833 --> 18:30.958
[sheep bleating]

18:31.041 --> 18:33.000
[Max] Sheep pens. Shearing shed.

18:33.083 --> 18:35.958
When you're running livestock,
you wanna make sure they're safe,

18:36.041 --> 18:38.125
fed, you know, watered.

18:38.208 --> 18:40.333
Keep up on diseases and pregnancies.

18:40.416 --> 18:43.375
Sounds like things get pretty wild here
on a Saturday night.

18:43.458 --> 18:44.291
[Lola chuckling]

18:45.000 --> 18:45.833
Yeah.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.041
[Lola grunting]

18:54.833 --> 18:58.375
[Max] Uh, so, during the season,
we shear about 500 sheep a day.

18:58.458 --> 19:01.500
Ah. Okay.
So that's where the action happens.

19:01.583 --> 19:02.416
Uh, yeah, nah.

19:02.500 --> 19:05.875
You won't be doing any sheep work.
That's for the experienced hands.

19:06.375 --> 19:08.166
Okay. So, what will I be doing?

19:08.916 --> 19:11.500
Chores. Grunt work. Hard yakka.

19:12.541 --> 19:14.208
Hey, you volunteered for it.

19:14.750 --> 19:17.041
Not complaining. I love grunt work.

19:17.125 --> 19:18.750
Whoo! Bring it on.

19:18.833 --> 19:20.041
That's good to hear.

19:20.708 --> 19:22.875
We'll start you off
with some fence mending.

19:24.791 --> 19:27.791
We have kangaroos out here,
constantly making holes.

19:28.291 --> 19:32.250
Kangaroos? Like, boing-boing ones
with pouches? Will I get to see some?

19:32.333 --> 19:35.708
Yeah. That "boing-boing one"
will kick you flat on your back.

19:35.791 --> 19:37.125
What about koalas?

19:37.208 --> 19:38.333
Uh, they scratch.

19:38.416 --> 19:40.416
Huge claws, like this.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.416
Oh. So disappointing.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.291
Do you have to burst every bubble?

19:44.375 --> 19:46.250
-[engine sputtering]
-[Max] Maybe.

19:46.833 --> 19:48.166
[engine rattling]

19:49.958 --> 19:52.250
[Max] Hey, don't-- Lazza, don't.

19:52.958 --> 19:55.625
-Lazza, don't keep--
-[Lola] Oh. [chuckles]

19:55.708 --> 19:58.458
[groaning] Lazza,
don't quit on me here. Come on.

19:59.708 --> 20:01.416
[engine backfires, dies]

20:03.000 --> 20:04.041
[keys turning]

20:04.125 --> 20:05.000
[steam hissing]

20:07.791 --> 20:10.000
Busted radiator. Gotta walk back.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.166
Wait. Can't you call a tow truck?

20:12.250 --> 20:14.833
[chuckles] Yeah, nah.
There's no reception out here.

20:14.916 --> 20:16.375
Oh, great. [scoffing]

20:16.458 --> 20:18.208
Station life is unpredictable.

20:18.708 --> 20:21.958
As they say, "If you jump
in the saddle, be ready for the ride."

20:22.458 --> 20:25.166
-Was that a cowboy wisdom quote?
-Stockman. No cowboys here.

20:25.250 --> 20:26.291
Then what's a jackaroo?

20:26.375 --> 20:27.416
[Max chuckling]

20:28.125 --> 20:31.333
Well, it's technically a cowboy,
but it's a term for newbies like you.

20:31.416 --> 20:33.583
-Are they all you got?
-My ankle boots?

20:33.666 --> 20:35.125
Uh, um…

20:35.708 --> 20:37.708
-Oh, I have sneakers too.
-Oh, that's no good.

20:38.208 --> 20:39.791
-Flip-flops?
-It's rough land out here.

20:39.875 --> 20:42.000
You'll need Blunnies to protect your feet.

20:42.666 --> 20:44.208
And you didn't even bring a hat.

20:44.291 --> 20:46.041
It was kinda supposed
to be a two-night stay.

20:46.125 --> 20:47.458
-Right.
-You guys got a gift shop?

20:47.541 --> 20:49.291
[chuckling] That's very funny.

20:49.375 --> 20:51.083
-Here. Take mine. [laughing]
-Oh! No, no, no.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.666
Okay. Oh, right.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.041
Well, then, thank you.

20:55.125 --> 20:57.000
This is… This is fine. I'm fine.

20:57.083 --> 20:58.875
[Max] Well, you won't be in an hour or so.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.041
Australian sun shows no mercy.

21:01.541 --> 21:03.166
We'll start back training tomorrow.

21:03.666 --> 21:05.666
[Lola] This is gonna be fun. [chuckling]

21:05.750 --> 21:08.041
[peaceful music playing]

21:08.125 --> 21:08.958
[Lola] What?

21:10.000 --> 21:11.250
[Max] Sixty days, huh?

21:12.083 --> 21:15.375
-[Lola] To get my wine importer's license?
-[Max] I pay attention.

21:15.916 --> 21:16.875
[Lola] Huh.

21:16.958 --> 21:20.666
Yeah. There's no way Hazel's gonna go
for a company that doesn't exist yet.

21:20.750 --> 21:23.125
You do realize how absurd that is, right?

21:24.083 --> 21:26.208
Well, sometimes you have to take risks.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.041
Believe in yourself.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.416
You know, go big or go home.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.291
Yeah. Well, good on ya.

21:33.833 --> 21:35.416
But I wouldn't get my hopes up.

21:36.291 --> 21:39.166
Okay. Well,
thank you for the encouragement.

21:39.250 --> 21:40.666
I'm just being practical.

21:40.750 --> 21:42.666
Practical isn't really my style.

21:43.875 --> 21:45.000
[exhaling sharply]

21:45.666 --> 21:47.625
Is it always so hot here?

21:47.708 --> 21:48.541
Nah.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.541
Gets heaps hotter in the arvo.

21:53.416 --> 21:55.541
-Arvo?
-[Max] Means "afternoon."

21:56.083 --> 21:57.583
[indistinct chatter]

[keyboard clacking]

22:01.500 --> 22:02.750
[indistinct clamoring]

22:04.250 --> 22:06.458
[woman] Who's the one
who lives in the van?

22:06.541 --> 22:08.791
[woman 2] No.
The blonde one from last Saturday.

22:08.875 --> 22:09.708
[woman 2 chuckling]

22:09.791 --> 22:12.583
[woman 2] He's the only shaggable man
within 200 kilometers.

22:12.666 --> 22:14.333
[woman] This is why I'm glad
I'm not single.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.708
Hi. Lola from L.A.

22:15.791 --> 22:17.875
Your new roomie. [chuckling]

22:17.958 --> 22:18.916
Hi.

22:24.041 --> 22:25.958
Oh, impromptu mobile office.

22:27.958 --> 22:29.958
[all chuckling]

22:31.375 --> 22:33.083
I got a Skype-date with Heidi.

22:33.166 --> 22:35.416
Yeah. Lockie hasn't messaged
me back since Tuesday.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.291
He's definitely ghosting me.

22:37.375 --> 22:38.750
Ugh, men.

22:38.833 --> 22:39.791
[chuckling]

22:39.875 --> 22:42.541
I'm Breeze. And don't worry about them.

22:43.125 --> 22:45.166
Takes a while to earn their trust.

22:45.250 --> 22:49.291
Oh. Yeah, I'm only here for two weeks.
I'm not trying to steal their jobs, so…

22:49.375 --> 22:51.458
Reckon that airport van'll
be back here in no time.

22:51.541 --> 22:53.333
Bet you ten bucks
she doesn't last the week.

22:53.416 --> 22:54.958
-[chuckles] Deal.
-[shower knob squeaks]

22:55.666 --> 22:56.500
Um,

22:57.000 --> 22:58.583
sitting right here. Just--

22:58.666 --> 22:59.875
-[man screaming]
-Oh!

22:59.958 --> 23:02.625
[man] Oh no!
Somebody used all the hot water!

23:02.708 --> 23:04.708
-What? Are you kidding?
-Are you serious?

23:04.791 --> 23:09.250
Sorry. It was a 14-hour flight.
I really needed that long shower.

23:09.333 --> 23:12.083
-[scoffing]
-Heidi. Hi, baby.

23:12.166 --> 23:13.875
Hey. How you going?

23:13.958 --> 23:16.375
[woman 2] I'm good.
Tired. You look amazing.

23:16.458 --> 23:17.708
[electricity crackling]

23:17.791 --> 23:20.541
-[woman 2] No…
-[woman] Oh, come on.

23:20.625 --> 23:23.833
Well, that is just brilliant.

23:23.916 --> 23:25.041
Sorry.

23:25.750 --> 23:28.125
[contemplative music playing]

23:33.291 --> 23:34.875
[birds chirping]

23:34.958 --> 23:36.958
-[bird squawking loudly]
-[Lola gasping]

23:37.541 --> 23:39.541
[Lola groaning]

23:42.833 --> 23:44.833
Chores don't do themselves, Big Smoke.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.000
[Lola sighing]

23:53.458 --> 23:54.708
[man] Here you go, Henry.

23:55.208 --> 23:56.041
Today's riddle.

23:56.125 --> 23:58.916
Oh, not this again. Every damn morning.

23:59.750 --> 24:01.375
Gotta keep you on your toes.

24:02.083 --> 24:04.791
What ship has two mates but no captain?

24:05.458 --> 24:07.000
-[woman] Like a canoe?
-[Henry] Nah.

24:07.083 --> 24:09.333
No, like a kayak with, like, two seats.

24:09.416 --> 24:10.791
Oh, thank you.

24:10.875 --> 24:13.250
-[woman] Titanic.
-[Henry] That doesn't even make sense.

24:13.333 --> 24:14.791
-[Lola groans]
-[woman 2] A submarine?

24:14.875 --> 24:15.958
Sorry, sir?

24:16.041 --> 24:17.000
Excuse me,

24:17.083 --> 24:20.333
do you have any other coffee options,
like a latte or an espresso?

24:21.500 --> 24:22.750
You're joking. Right?

24:23.583 --> 24:24.416
[man slurping]

24:24.500 --> 24:26.750
Okay. I can work with this. No worries.

24:28.791 --> 24:31.208
Oi, over here. We saved you a seat.

24:31.833 --> 24:34.583
You guys are, uh, talking to me now?

24:34.666 --> 24:38.125
Uh, well, Breeze was right.
We can be a bit too hard on the newbies.

24:38.208 --> 24:40.458
Yeah. We were just pulling your leg
last night, that's all.

24:40.541 --> 24:41.916
Okay. [scoffing]

24:42.458 --> 24:44.250
-Hi.
-Hi. Morning.

24:45.041 --> 24:47.083
[Lola screaming]

24:47.166 --> 24:48.125
[both laughing]

24:48.208 --> 24:51.541
Oh, don't. You two are terrible.
Leave her alone, the poor thing.

24:51.625 --> 24:54.583
-Best prank ever.
-It never gets old. [laughing]

24:54.666 --> 24:56.250
[Lola chuckling sarcastically]

24:56.333 --> 24:58.625
Bit of a friendly hazing.
Should've warned ya.

24:58.708 --> 25:02.333
-We all get it on our first day.
-Yeah. Female friendship is overrated.

25:02.416 --> 25:03.625
I got it! The riddle.

25:04.666 --> 25:05.750
A relationship.

25:05.833 --> 25:07.000
Yeah. We have a winner.

25:07.083 --> 25:08.291
-Oh.
-Oh.

25:08.375 --> 25:11.250
[Henry] First prize,
an extra snag from Danno here.

25:11.333 --> 25:12.916
-[woman] I'm getting it tonight.
-Morning.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.916
-[Henry] Hey, boss.
-[all] Morning.

25:16.250 --> 25:18.666
-You ready to get started?
-Yeah, let's do it.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.500
[peaceful music playing]

25:20.583 --> 25:21.750
[bird warbling]

25:24.208 --> 25:26.416
[Max] Right, so you bend this. Like that.

25:26.500 --> 25:27.333
[Lola] Okay.

25:27.833 --> 25:32.041
Feed this through here, right?
Then you twist it. You twist that back.

25:32.125 --> 25:35.375
Then you twist that back through there,
and then you… Right, okay.

25:35.458 --> 25:37.166
-Like that. See?
-[Lola] Yeah.

25:37.958 --> 25:40.375
-So you hold this and pull down.
-[Lola] Uh-huh.

25:41.500 --> 25:43.000
-And that's it. Done.
-Oh.

25:44.291 --> 25:45.291
Show me again.

25:46.500 --> 25:47.500
[Max chuckling]

25:48.291 --> 25:50.208
-Seriously?
-Just-- Last time, I swear.

25:50.750 --> 25:51.708
This is the one.

25:53.458 --> 25:54.291
Huh.

25:54.791 --> 25:58.541
A week ago, I was pouring a Cabernet
for the sommelier at the Ritz-Carlton.

25:59.208 --> 26:00.833
And now, I'm pouring sheep food.

26:01.916 --> 26:02.833
What happened?

26:02.916 --> 26:04.125
[sheep bleating]

26:06.083 --> 26:07.916
Oh. Hey, girl.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.291
Somebody looks hungry. You ready to eat?

26:10.875 --> 26:11.708
[sheep bleating]

26:11.791 --> 26:12.791
[Lola] Okay, then.

26:13.416 --> 26:15.083
You got it easy, sister.

26:15.166 --> 26:17.041
Waited on hand and hoof.

26:17.125 --> 26:17.958
[yelling]

26:18.041 --> 26:20.291
[grunting, groaning]

26:20.791 --> 26:21.750
[breathing heavily]

26:23.416 --> 26:25.500
Bon appétit, whoever you are.

26:25.583 --> 26:26.708
[sheep bleating]

26:27.375 --> 26:28.500
Wait. Who are you?

26:29.666 --> 26:30.583
You need a name.

26:31.083 --> 26:32.000
Come on.

26:32.791 --> 26:33.916
Oh! No, no, no, no!

26:34.000 --> 26:36.166
Stop. Stop it. Don't do that!

26:36.250 --> 26:38.708
Just spitballing here. Uh, Meryl Sheep?

26:38.791 --> 26:39.708
[Lola straining]

26:40.458 --> 26:42.541
Just-- That's it! Don't--

26:43.083 --> 26:44.125
[chuckling]

26:44.208 --> 26:45.958
Uh, Calista Flockhart?

26:46.041 --> 26:48.000
-Yup. Good boy.
-[sheep bleating]

26:48.500 --> 26:49.458
Okay.

26:49.541 --> 26:51.416
-Hey. You're mixing up the mob.
-What?

26:51.500 --> 26:53.083
You see the different colored tags here?

26:55.833 --> 26:56.666
Oh.

26:56.750 --> 26:59.666
You better get to re-sorting the sheep.
They're not gonna sort themselves.

26:59.750 --> 27:02.625
Yeah, okay. All right.
Listen up, guys, okay? No mingling.

27:03.208 --> 27:04.750
Hey! Hello? Hello?

27:04.833 --> 27:06.208
Pay attention. No, no, no.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.958
Wait, hey, do you have wool in your ears?
What the flock.

27:09.041 --> 27:11.541
No. I've got it.

27:12.083 --> 27:13.625
You are a grand dame.

27:13.708 --> 27:14.791
A diva.

27:14.875 --> 27:17.791
You are Baaabra Streisand.

27:17.875 --> 27:18.833
[sheep bleating]

27:18.916 --> 27:20.000
[Lola laughing]

27:20.083 --> 27:21.250
I like you.

27:21.750 --> 27:23.625
Move it. Move… Thank you.

27:23.708 --> 27:25.541
Stay. Stay. Okay.

27:25.625 --> 27:27.750
-[Max laughing]
-[sheep bleating]

27:27.833 --> 27:28.875
Wait, no.

27:29.791 --> 27:30.750
Okay.

27:30.833 --> 27:31.750
Um,

27:33.041 --> 27:34.375
cool.

27:37.291 --> 27:38.208
Ugh.

27:39.208 --> 27:41.208
[retching] Ugh.

27:47.375 --> 27:49.875
[sheep bleating]

27:56.458 --> 27:57.375
[Lola] Oh.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.500
Your boots are amazing. [chuckling]

27:59.583 --> 28:01.708
I should've consulted you before I packed.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.333
-Um, speaking of…
-[Hazel] Mm-hmm.

28:05.416 --> 28:08.500
…on the plane I read in Wine Spectator
that you like unique wines.

28:08.583 --> 28:11.916
And there's this all-female collective
out of Uruguay doing amazing stuff.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.166
I could, uh… I could arrange
for them to send you some bottles.

28:15.791 --> 28:17.375
I'm busy with station work.

28:18.291 --> 28:19.375
You should be too.

28:22.041 --> 28:23.125
[sighing heavily]

28:24.208 --> 28:27.958
-[Lola] Why is this so hard?
-[Max] Yeah. Well, station life is tough.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.750
Can't wine and dine
your way out of problems.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.791
Oh, that's what you think I do all day?

28:32.916 --> 28:35.375
Well, isn't it?

28:35.458 --> 28:37.291
[bird squawking]

28:37.916 --> 28:39.083
Well, technically, yes.

28:39.166 --> 28:41.250
-Huh.
-[Lola] But I'm a self-starter.

28:41.875 --> 28:44.125
Number one at Girl Scout cookie sales
three years in a row.

28:44.916 --> 28:46.583
High school valedictorian.

28:46.666 --> 28:50.166
Nailed my sommelier exam at age 22,
which is basically unheard of.

28:50.250 --> 28:53.666
And I do the New York Times
crossword puzzle in ink.

28:53.750 --> 28:55.500
I do not fail. I've got this.

28:56.375 --> 28:58.833
Well, a stubborn horse walks
ahead of the herd.

28:58.916 --> 29:01.166
Where do you get these quotes? Pinterest?

29:01.708 --> 29:02.541
Huh.

29:06.791 --> 29:07.625
Ah?

29:08.750 --> 29:10.000
Ah?

29:10.083 --> 29:11.083
[straining]

29:14.041 --> 29:15.000
[groaning]

29:15.500 --> 29:16.458
[Lola sighing]

29:16.958 --> 29:19.000
-Hey, hey! Stop! Stop!
-No. I'll fix it.

29:19.083 --> 29:20.750
I just need to get the plow!

29:20.833 --> 29:23.833
-Brown snake! It's a brown snake.
-[tense music playing]

29:23.916 --> 29:25.166
-[hissing]
-[Lola] Oh.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.500
[both breathing heavily]

29:29.375 --> 29:31.750
[contemplative music playing]

29:31.833 --> 29:32.833
Extremely deadly.

29:36.875 --> 29:37.708
Okay.

29:41.875 --> 29:43.583
-[Max clearing throat]
-Well, uh…

29:43.666 --> 29:45.875
[Max] Oh, you leave 'em be,
they'll leave you be.

29:46.958 --> 29:48.500
[birds chirping]

29:50.875 --> 29:52.416
Getting closer and closer.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.333
-Can you believe it?
-[woman] Yeah, can't wait.

29:55.416 --> 29:56.583
I'm so excited.

29:57.458 --> 29:59.916
Love you, Heidi. Take care of our bean.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.083
[Heidi] Love you too.

30:01.166 --> 30:03.166
Sam's partner Heidi is up the duff.

30:03.833 --> 30:04.875
Like Hilary?

30:05.375 --> 30:06.291
[Breeze chuckling]

30:06.375 --> 30:08.625
Like pregnant. Due next month.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.166
Ah. What? Congratulations.

30:11.250 --> 30:12.291
[Sam] Yeah.

30:12.791 --> 30:14.916
-Campfire time. Oi.
-[people laughing]

30:15.000 --> 30:17.208
-Hmm? Yes.
-[Sam] Let's get some coldies.

30:17.708 --> 30:19.750
-Breeze.
-Yeah, coming.

30:19.833 --> 30:20.958
[guitar music playing]

30:22.708 --> 30:25.750
Oi, newbie. I noticed
the dunny's looking pretty scungy.

30:26.333 --> 30:27.166
So…

30:30.416 --> 30:31.708
[Sam snickering]

30:32.500 --> 30:34.500
[man laughing heartily]

30:34.583 --> 30:36.666
Sorry, I should've warned ya, again.

30:37.416 --> 30:39.541
Newest jillaroo gets toilet-cleaning duty.

30:40.041 --> 30:41.000
[chuckling lightly]

30:42.083 --> 30:44.083
[indistinct chatter outside]

30:44.625 --> 30:45.458
Ugh.

[contemplative music playing]

30:52.916 --> 30:54.500
[bird screeching]

30:55.041 --> 30:58.000
[Lola groaning, moaning]

31:04.125 --> 31:07.208
And so, we repurpose sheep manure
into fertilizer.

31:07.916 --> 31:09.875
It's all part of keeping Waratah green.

31:09.958 --> 31:11.125
[Lola inhaling sharply]

31:11.208 --> 31:15.166
Okay. The, uh, eco-friendly aspect
of this farm got a lot less appealing.

and humidity to age the wine.

with a rival winery.

Then Hazel lured me away
when she expanded Vaughn Family Wines.

1:10:32.958 --> 1:10:37.208
Oh, I can see why. It's amazing here.
And you said all the wines are organic?

1:10:37.291 --> 1:10:39.416
-Yes. And biodynamic.
-Wow.

1:10:39.500 --> 1:10:41.541
No chemicals, no manipulations,

-So, my specialty is blends.
-[Lola] Hmm.

1:10:46.541 --> 1:10:50.375
Vaughn Family Wines have really unique
flavor profiles found nowhere else.

1:10:50.458 --> 1:10:53.541
The varietals both complement
and contrast in the glass.

1:10:53.625 --> 1:10:55.291
-[Felix] Mm-hmm.
-Hmm. Okay.

1:10:55.375 --> 1:10:57.041
I'll get you to try this.

1:10:57.125 --> 1:10:58.541
This is a Shiraz blend

1:10:58.625 --> 1:11:00.916
from the cooler climate
of the Yarra Valley.

1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:10.250
Oh.

1:11:10.333 --> 1:11:13.041
It's like I'm in a rustic mountain cabin,

1:11:13.125 --> 1:11:14.875

next to a wood-burning fire,

1:11:14.958 --> 1:11:16.708

1:11:16.791 --> 1:11:18.458
Mm. Beautifully put.

1:11:18.541 --> 1:11:21.375
We've also produced a Chardonnay blend
from the same region.

It's my special reserve.

Ooh. Sign me up for that.

1:11:27.333 --> 1:11:29.583
It's 200 dollars a bottle.

Um, sign me up
for the email list instead, maybe.

1:11:33.333 --> 1:11:36.166

-Cool, thanks.

So, how does this work?
I mean, you're obviously a regular here.

1:11:53.416 --> 1:11:55.166
I like the way you talk about wine.

1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:58.708
Yeah. How it transports you.

1:12:00.625 --> 1:12:02.958
Well, I believe that wine
should be a vacation.

1:12:03.041 --> 1:12:04.583
Or should I say holiday?

1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:08.916
[glass clinking]

1:12:09.750 --> 1:12:12.291
Is this the official label
for all the Vaughn Family Wines?

1:12:12.375 --> 1:12:15.291
Uh, think so, yeah. Felix would know.

1:12:16.083 --> 1:12:18.083
I wonder why it's called
Vaughn Family Wines.

1:12:18.166 --> 1:12:20.500
I mean, Hazel kinda seems like a solo act.

1:12:20.583 --> 1:12:21.958
[dramatic music playing]

1:12:22.833 --> 1:12:23.791
[Lola] Hmm.

1:12:24.416 --> 1:12:26.625
Where is my notebook?

1:12:26.708 --> 1:12:28.666
This place is giving me ideas.

1:12:30.583 --> 1:12:31.833
[Max sighing]

1:12:36.291 --> 1:12:39.875
[Max] Hey, last night, uh,
you said something at the pub.

1:12:39.958 --> 1:12:41.458
-Oh God, what?
-[Max chuckling]

1:12:41.541 --> 1:12:44.541
-Actually, no. Don't tell me.
-[Max] Nah, it's too late.

1:12:44.625 --> 1:12:47.000
Uh, you said I seem lonely.

1:12:47.625 --> 1:12:48.791
[birds chirping]

1:12:49.291 --> 1:12:50.833
-Yikes.
-[Max] Mm-hmm.

1:12:50.916 --> 1:12:52.958
I guess, uh… [inhales deeply]

1:12:53.041 --> 1:12:55.375
in vino veritas?

1:12:55.458 --> 1:12:56.541
Boozy truth?

1:12:57.291 --> 1:12:58.541
You know, I always chalked it up

1:12:58.625 --> 1:13:01.458
to most women
not liking life out in the bush.

1:13:01.541 --> 1:13:04.625
It's hot, remote, dangerous.

1:13:04.708 --> 1:13:06.750
[scoffing] It is not
for the faint of heart.

1:13:06.833 --> 1:13:12.000
Yeah, but rugged loner is just a way
of making excuses for myself.

1:13:14.291 --> 1:13:17.000
You know, when my mum died,
I promised I'd do better,

1:13:17.083 --> 1:13:20.166
but I've just been playing it safe.

1:13:21.375 --> 1:13:22.291
[chuckling]

1:13:22.375 --> 1:13:23.708
Unlike someone I know.

1:13:25.166 --> 1:13:26.916
Wow. Okay.

1:13:27.458 --> 1:13:30.916
Turns out my drunken babbling
wasn't such a disaster after…

1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:32.333
[gasping] Oh.

1:13:32.416 --> 1:13:34.041
Kangaroo! A baby kangaroo.

1:13:34.125 --> 1:13:36.625
-[Max sighing] A juvenile.
-[Lola] Baby kangaroo.

1:13:36.708 --> 1:13:39.500
See, I bet its mum made this hole
in the fence. They're everywhere.

1:13:39.583 --> 1:13:42.791
Okay. Can I not just enjoy
this one stereotypical Aussie moment?

1:13:42.875 --> 1:13:44.458
Oh my God. [gasping]

1:13:45.958 --> 1:13:48.500
Are you serious? That is your lock screen?

1:13:48.583 --> 1:13:51.250
Excuse me, sir. This is a private photo
of me and my best friend.

1:13:51.333 --> 1:13:52.791
-[Max] Ugh.
-[gasping]

1:13:53.708 --> 1:13:55.208
-[camera shutter clicking]
-[Lola] Aww.

1:13:55.291 --> 1:13:57.833
Now I just need to see a koala.
You promised.

1:13:57.916 --> 1:13:59.166
I did no such thing.

1:13:59.250 --> 1:14:00.458
-[Lola] Yes, you did.
-Nope.

1:14:00.541 --> 1:14:02.041
Remember the other day?

1:14:02.125 --> 1:14:04.500
-[Max] I don't, 'cause it didn't happen.
-You said it.

1:14:05.291 --> 1:14:06.250
Better make it happen.

1:14:06.333 --> 1:14:08.958
You're making…
You better fix that fence right now.

1:14:09.041 --> 1:14:10.208
[Lola laughing]

1:14:10.291 --> 1:14:11.416
It's so cute.

1:14:11.500 --> 1:14:12.916
[magical music playing]

1:14:22.083 --> 1:14:23.041
[Lola exhaling sharply]

1:14:24.333 --> 1:14:25.625
Wow. [chuckles]

1:14:26.166 --> 1:14:28.625
Australia showing off again.

1:14:32.416 --> 1:14:34.750
Thank you, Australia!

1:14:35.833 --> 1:14:37.208
[both laughing]

1:14:39.375 --> 1:14:40.250
[Lola sighing]

1:14:47.583 --> 1:14:48.500
[Max groaning]

1:14:49.250 --> 1:14:51.166
[Max] What are you scribbling so intently?

1:14:52.166 --> 1:14:54.375
-[Lola] I was inspired by our field trip.
-[Max] Hmm.

1:14:54.458 --> 1:14:57.208
I have new ideas to pitch to Hazel.

1:14:57.291 --> 1:14:58.458
[crickets chirping]

1:15:00.250 --> 1:15:01.541
[Max] Ah. [chuckling]

1:15:02.041 --> 1:15:03.000
Sybylla Vaughn.

1:15:03.500 --> 1:15:05.000
Yep. A new label.

1:15:05.083 --> 1:15:06.875
Every bottle should tell her story.

1:15:08.208 --> 1:15:09.791
[romantic music playing]

1:15:10.375 --> 1:15:12.541
Look, Lola,
the funny thing about Sybylla is--

1:15:12.625 --> 1:15:15.166
Sybylla is what makes Vaughn Family Wines.

1:15:15.250 --> 1:15:17.666
She's the key. I mean,
she can create a personal relationship

1:15:17.750 --> 1:15:19.708
between the winemaker
and the wine drinker.

1:15:19.791 --> 1:15:22.750
Sybylla is an aspirational inspiration
to all.

1:15:27.625 --> 1:15:29.333
That's a really great idea.

1:15:31.125 --> 1:15:32.833
I've been feeling really creative.

1:15:33.333 --> 1:15:35.625
[sighing] I think it's
from my time here at Waratah Station.

1:15:35.708 --> 1:15:39.708
-I don't know how to put it, but--
-It's revived your senses, maybe?

1:15:39.791 --> 1:15:41.000
-Yes!
-Yeah. [chuckling]

1:15:41.083 --> 1:15:42.333
[chuckling] Exactly.

1:15:43.333 --> 1:15:47.791
Air smells fresher.
Food tastes better. I sleep like a log.

1:15:47.875 --> 1:15:51.083
[chuckles] Okay.
Well, I can drink to that.

1:15:53.750 --> 1:15:54.875
Wait, is that the…

1:15:54.958 --> 1:15:57.125
is that the 200-dollar bottle
of Chardonnay?

1:15:57.208 --> 1:15:59.541
I had Felix put it on ice.

1:15:59.625 --> 1:16:01.916
You… You said you wanted to try it.

1:16:03.250 --> 1:16:04.333
Just say cheers.

1:16:05.250 --> 1:16:06.083
Okay.

1:16:06.750 --> 1:16:07.583
Salud.

1:16:08.916 --> 1:16:09.833
[Lola chuckles]

1:16:13.041 --> 1:16:14.083
[Max sighing]

1:16:14.750 --> 1:16:15.583
Oh.

1:16:15.666 --> 1:16:16.500
Yeah.

1:16:16.583 --> 1:16:17.958
[Lola laughing]

1:16:18.583 --> 1:16:21.416
And we're also celebrating
sparing your sheep.

1:16:21.500 --> 1:16:23.083
Blah Blah whatever its name is.

1:16:23.166 --> 1:16:24.916
-It won't be Sunday supper. Oh God.
-Baaabra?

1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:26.208
-Yeah. It won't
-Really?

1:16:26.291 --> 1:16:27.291
Yeah, nah.

1:16:27.375 --> 1:16:30.833
Was that more on the "yeah," or the "nah"?
Or just a meaningless "yeah, nah"?

1:16:30.916 --> 1:16:33.041
[laughs] Yeah, nah.
You won me over. All right?

1:16:33.125 --> 1:16:35.208
-Can we put a cute scarf around her neck?
-[Max] No.

1:16:35.291 --> 1:16:38.083
-And a… and a name plaque on her pen?
-Oh my goodness.

1:16:38.166 --> 1:16:39.166
[both laughing]

1:16:39.250 --> 1:16:41.000
-[Max] Settle down.
-Please?

1:16:41.083 --> 1:16:41.916
Nah.

1:16:45.875 --> 1:16:46.916
[Lola] Mm.

1:16:48.583 --> 1:16:50.375
I don't want today to end…

1:16:50.916 --> 1:16:52.291
-[Lola yawning]
-[Max chuckling]

1:16:52.375 --> 1:16:54.583
…but bed is calling my name.

1:16:54.666 --> 1:16:55.916
[Max] Swag check.

1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:57.500
-[Lola groaning]
-[Max] Hey.

1:16:58.708 --> 1:17:00.166
Oh!

1:17:00.250 --> 1:17:02.083
Oh, it's just a harmless tree snake.

1:17:02.166 --> 1:17:04.333
Likes to warm up in the bedroll, don't ya?

1:17:04.416 --> 1:17:05.375
[breath shuddering]

1:17:05.458 --> 1:17:07.750
Just when I was starting
to like this place.

1:17:07.833 --> 1:17:09.958
There you go, buddy.

1:17:14.333 --> 1:17:15.291
Okay.

1:17:15.833 --> 1:17:16.833
[breathing shakily]

1:17:16.916 --> 1:17:17.958
[Max chuckling]

1:17:18.041 --> 1:17:20.166
-Wow. [chuckles nervously]
-[Max] It's all good.

1:17:20.250 --> 1:17:22.500
-Whatever you say.
-Whatever I say.

1:17:22.583 --> 1:17:23.875
[Lola sighing]

1:17:23.958 --> 1:17:24.833
[Max grunting]

1:17:24.916 --> 1:17:26.916
Oh, okay. Hello?

1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.375
-[Max] You all right? [laughs]
-[laughing] Yeah.

1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:30.875
Oh.

1:17:31.416 --> 1:17:33.541
The stars are amazing here.

1:17:34.166 --> 1:17:35.250
[Lola sighing]

1:17:35.333 --> 1:17:38.583
That's Alpha Centauri there,

1:17:39.541 --> 1:17:42.541
and, uh, that's the Southern Cross.

1:17:44.458 --> 1:17:45.291
Hey.

1:17:46.375 --> 1:17:47.958
What if that snake comes back?

1:17:55.500 --> 1:17:57.625
We will have safety in numbers.

1:18:04.833 --> 1:18:06.125
Lola, there's, uh…

1:18:09.083 --> 1:18:11.041
there's something I need to tell you.

1:18:12.333 --> 1:18:16.500
I should've told you a while ago it's…
but it's not as big as--

1:18:16.583 --> 1:18:18.208
[romantic music playing]

1:18:22.708 --> 1:18:23.750
[Lola exhales sharply]

1:18:31.958 --> 1:18:32.958
[Lola moaning]

1:18:45.500 --> 1:18:46.333
[Lola] Hmm.

1:18:46.416 --> 1:18:47.666
[Max] Morning, spitfire.

1:18:47.750 --> 1:18:49.416
Morning, boss cocky.

1:18:53.125 --> 1:18:54.000
Hmm.

1:18:54.500 --> 1:18:55.375
Uh, Lola.

1:18:56.583 --> 1:18:58.291
You need to know now.

1:18:58.375 --> 1:18:59.333
[birds warbling]

1:19:00.291 --> 1:19:01.250
I'm Max Vaughn.

1:19:03.166 --> 1:19:04.750
-Sorry, what?
-[Max] Max Vaughn.

1:19:05.958 --> 1:19:07.958
Great-great grandson of Sybylla Vaughn.

1:19:08.875 --> 1:19:10.458
Hazel Vaughn's younger brother.

1:19:12.416 --> 1:19:14.333
Wait. What?

1:19:15.958 --> 1:19:17.708
No. What? No, no, no.

1:19:17.791 --> 1:19:22.375
I… I google-stalked Hazel before I came.
I mean, a Fatal Attraction-level stalk--

1:19:22.458 --> 1:19:24.458
Yeah. I… I don't have social media,

1:19:24.541 --> 1:19:27.291
and I wiped the Internet
of my family ties.

1:19:28.416 --> 1:19:30.666
You can do that
when you have heaps of money.

1:19:31.500 --> 1:19:33.375
-Wait, Hazel's money?
-[Max] No, mine.

1:19:33.875 --> 1:19:35.500
Hazel and I are business partners.

1:19:35.583 --> 1:19:37.500
I'm… I'm a silent investor.

1:19:39.708 --> 1:19:41.750
I don't… I don't understand.

1:19:41.833 --> 1:19:44.208
When Mum died,
Hazel and I inherited Waratah.

1:19:45.083 --> 1:19:47.541
All right?
I turned it into a profitable station

1:19:47.625 --> 1:19:49.875
while Hazey went off
and earned her MBA at uni

1:19:49.958 --> 1:19:51.958
and invested in her first company.

1:19:53.041 --> 1:19:54.416
I gave her the capital.

1:19:56.375 --> 1:19:59.416
Listen, Lola.
Hazel is my sister and I love her,

1:20:00.500 --> 1:20:01.833
but I don't envy her.

1:20:02.458 --> 1:20:05.250
The people will do anything
to get access to her.

1:20:05.333 --> 1:20:08.166
Oh. What, like me?
So, you think that I'd use you?

1:20:08.250 --> 1:20:11.625
In all fairness, you did come to Waratah
to land Hazel as a client.

1:20:11.708 --> 1:20:13.208
Yeah, but I was truthful.

1:20:13.708 --> 1:20:15.500
I mean, I… I told you both why I was here.

1:20:15.583 --> 1:20:17.958
I'm not some thief after anyone's money.

1:20:18.041 --> 1:20:20.291
I worked hard for a genuine opportunity.

1:20:20.375 --> 1:20:22.458
But you know what?
What would you know about honesty?

1:20:22.541 --> 1:20:24.666
Yeah. All right.
Look, I deserve that. All right?

1:20:24.750 --> 1:20:25.958
The thing is, Lola, I just…

1:20:26.750 --> 1:20:28.916
I never expected you
to throw me for a loop.

1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:33.291
Okay, so all this time,
sharing confidences…

1:20:33.375 --> 1:20:37.125
I even asked you about Vaughn Family Wines
and you're only telling me this now?

1:20:37.208 --> 1:20:40.208
I'm sorry. All right?
This isn't easy for me.

1:20:40.833 --> 1:20:43.666
The only person
at Waratah who knows is Hazel.

1:20:44.666 --> 1:20:45.750
But I trust you.

1:20:46.541 --> 1:20:50.291
Great… Great, you trust me, but…
but how am I now supposed to trust you?

1:20:50.375 --> 1:20:53.583
I'm the same person that you spent
the last two weeks with, Lola.

1:20:53.666 --> 1:20:56.375
The same person
that you kissed last night.

1:20:56.458 --> 1:20:57.791
Oh, right.

1:20:58.541 --> 1:21:00.458
I was just trying to protect my heart.

1:21:00.958 --> 1:21:03.958
Yeah. Well, I… I wish I'd done the same.

1:21:04.708 --> 1:21:05.916
[melancholy music playing]

1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:06.833
[Lola] You're right.

1:21:07.458 --> 1:21:09.708
I'm, uh… I'm here on business, so…

1:21:11.291 --> 1:21:12.208
let's get back to it.

1:21:16.083 --> 1:21:17.791
[truck engine revving]

1:21:18.750 --> 1:21:20.333
Oh, there you are.

1:21:21.166 --> 1:21:23.958
Lola, Hazel wants to see you
right now up at the house.

1:21:24.041 --> 1:21:25.375
-Now?
-[Breeze] Now.

1:21:25.458 --> 1:21:26.458
Okay.

1:21:29.083 --> 1:21:31.833
[Hazel and guests laughing]

1:21:31.916 --> 1:21:33.375
[Hazel] That is a great idea.

1:21:33.458 --> 1:21:34.875
[Calder] We'll make it happen.

1:21:34.958 --> 1:21:36.958
[Calder and Hazel laughing]

1:21:37.041 --> 1:21:38.041
[Hazel] That's good.

1:21:38.541 --> 1:21:39.541
Oh, Lola.

1:21:40.375 --> 1:21:42.666
Calder was just telling me
how you worked for him for years,

1:21:42.750 --> 1:21:45.625
and how devastated he was that you decided
to strike out on your own.

1:21:45.708 --> 1:21:47.541
It's why I came all this way.

1:21:48.125 --> 1:21:49.000
To hire you back.

1:21:49.083 --> 1:21:50.541
Wait, what? I thought--

1:21:50.625 --> 1:21:53.916
I'm impressed by the lengths
you went to to get this account.

1:21:55.583 --> 1:21:58.208
Lola's being promoted
to National Sales Director.

1:21:58.291 --> 1:21:59.916
She'll be handling your account.

1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:01.916
Vaughn Family Wines was all her idea.

1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:03.708
The timing is perfect.

1:22:04.250 --> 1:22:06.458
Calder, Lola can take you and Audra
to visit the winery,

1:22:06.541 --> 1:22:08.625
and I'll have my Sydney office
draw up the contracts.

1:22:08.708 --> 1:22:09.750
Sounds great.

1:22:10.833 --> 1:22:11.708
Right, Lola?

1:22:13.291 --> 1:22:15.083
[dramatic music playing]

1:22:23.958 --> 1:22:26.333
[smacking lips] Calder? A moment?

1:22:26.833 --> 1:22:27.875
Alone?

1:22:39.791 --> 1:22:41.416
You just show up blindsiding me?

1:22:41.500 --> 1:22:44.125
Look, Audra's no Lola. Okay?

1:22:44.208 --> 1:22:45.958
You hold things together at Mythos.

1:22:46.041 --> 1:22:49.166
So I'll forgive that messy outburst
you had when you quit.

1:22:49.250 --> 1:22:50.083
[Lola scoffing]

1:22:50.166 --> 1:22:53.833
A 20% pay bump
comes with that promotion, plus bonuses.

1:22:53.916 --> 1:22:57.250
Struggling is so pedestrian
when you don't need to, Lola.

1:22:57.875 --> 1:22:59.458
Make it easy on yourself.

1:22:59.541 --> 1:23:00.708
Say yes.

1:23:03.166 --> 1:23:04.083
[Lola] Hmm.

1:23:05.083 --> 1:23:06.125
I don't do easy.

1:23:06.708 --> 1:23:08.708
Never have. The answer is no.

1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:11.333
Everything good?

1:23:11.416 --> 1:23:14.125
Actually, uh, Calder's mistaken.

1:23:14.208 --> 1:23:15.791
I won't be returning to Mythos,

1:23:15.875 --> 1:23:19.541
but I understand that you need
to go with an established importer.

1:23:20.291 --> 1:23:22.666
I'm disappointed you won't be on my team.

1:23:22.750 --> 1:23:25.000
Salud Imports is just too new.

1:23:34.083 --> 1:23:36.291
[Lola] Sybylla Vaughn inspired me.

1:23:36.791 --> 1:23:38.666
You have a unique opportunity here

1:23:38.750 --> 1:23:41.416
to have her inspire
countless others around the world.

1:23:42.916 --> 1:23:43.833
Parting gift.

1:23:45.041 --> 1:23:46.041
Best of luck to you.

1:23:46.708 --> 1:23:48.083
Good luck to you too, Lola.

1:23:52.916 --> 1:23:56.416
Hazel, uh, shall we go back
and discuss strategy and scheduling?

1:23:56.500 --> 1:23:59.000
-Go ahead. I'll be right there.
-[Calder] Okay.

1:24:03.416 --> 1:24:05.208
You're doing the wrong thing, Haze.

1:24:05.291 --> 1:24:08.208
I saw Lola at the winery yesterday.
She's the person for the job.

1:24:08.291 --> 1:24:11.083
Well, now you suddenly care
about Vaughn Family Wines?

1:24:13.458 --> 1:24:16.291
Wild guess,
you decided to tell Lola who you are,

1:24:16.375 --> 1:24:18.458
and it was too late
and blew up in your face.

1:24:19.250 --> 1:24:20.250
Oh.

1:24:20.333 --> 1:24:23.708
Hate to say it, Brother,
you should've stepped up sooner.

1:24:24.583 --> 1:24:26.125
In work and in love.

1:24:34.041 --> 1:24:35.291
[sighs]

1:24:35.375 --> 1:24:38.375
Are you insane? You walked away
from everything you always wanted.

1:24:38.458 --> 1:24:40.541
You know, I've learned a lot
about myself in Australia.

1:24:40.625 --> 1:24:42.083
One is, I don't like Vegemite,

1:24:42.166 --> 1:24:45.458
but more importantly,
I was right when I quit Mythos.

1:24:45.541 --> 1:24:48.125
Life is too short
for the Calders of the world.

1:24:48.208 --> 1:24:50.000
You know, I… [shuddered breathing]

1:24:50.083 --> 1:24:52.625
I… I panicked.
I… I'm sorry, I was desperate.

1:24:52.708 --> 1:24:54.875
I'm… I am a horrible person.

1:24:54.958 --> 1:24:56.083
[breathing heavily]

1:24:56.166 --> 1:24:58.166
Look, I get it. Okay?

1:24:58.250 --> 1:25:00.875
You made a bad decision because you were
in a tough spot with Calder.

1:25:00.958 --> 1:25:03.583
There were tons of times
when I felt the same way.

1:25:04.166 --> 1:25:06.833
-Really? So you understand?

1:25:06.916 --> 1:25:08.541
Yeah, but it was not your finest moment.

1:25:08.625 --> 1:25:11.500
-Oh, no, no, I know I'm like… Oh my God.
-Let's be real.

1:25:11.583 --> 1:25:14.541
I really know that.
I'm so… I'm really… I'm so sorry.

1:25:14.625 --> 1:25:15.791
-Yeah.
-[Audra] I'm so…

1:25:16.458 --> 1:25:17.458
I'm so sorry.

1:25:18.375 --> 1:25:22.208
So, do you think
that we could be, like, friends again?

1:25:22.291 --> 1:25:26.000
-Yeah, nah. Don't get ahead of yourself.
-No, yeah. Yeah. You're right.

Hey, it's okay
to overdress for an occasion.

1:25:38.541 --> 1:25:40.916
Never apologize for style.

when you rented that nice apartment, Lola,

1:29:36.833 --> 1:29:39.916

into a yoga studio.

going with the Sybylla wine label.

1:29:59.208 --> 1:30:01.541
Yeah. Like, speaking of,

1:30:02.041 --> 1:30:04.291
it's all over the wine trade websites.

1:30:04.375 --> 1:30:05.291
[Lola] Hmm?

1:30:05.375 --> 1:30:07.833
Mythos and Vaughn Family Wines
have parted ways.

-Wow.
-[Audra] Yeah.

1:30:10.500 --> 1:30:11.416
That was quick.

1:30:11.916 --> 1:30:15.083
[Audra] Yeah. Like, still in
the contractual grace period, apparently.

1:30:15.166 --> 1:30:18.541
Um, the official reason is
they had, like, different working styles,

1:30:18.625 --> 1:30:20.000
but you know.

1:30:20.083 --> 1:30:22.208
I mean, AKA,
they got to know Calder better, right?

1:30:22.291 --> 1:30:23.125
[Lola] Ugh.

1:30:23.791 --> 1:30:27.791
So, like, should…
should we go after Vaughn Wines?

1:30:27.875 --> 1:30:29.375
I mean, it was your idea.

1:30:30.416 --> 1:30:31.833
Let's focus on new business.

1:30:32.541 --> 1:30:34.583

to figure this out,

1:30:40.541 --> 1:30:44.000
but it's not even
that he lied, you know? I…

1:30:44.916 --> 1:30:46.000
[exhaling sharply]

1:30:46.083 --> 1:30:49.250
I don't know. I just…
I don't think he knows who he is yet.

1:30:49.750 --> 1:30:55.708
Sure, but what if his way
to change that was to share it

1:30:55.791 --> 1:30:59.375
with someone he really trusted,
and that was you?

Since you gave me a second chance.

1:31:10.125 --> 1:31:11.833
You see the best in people, Lola.

1:31:12.666 --> 1:31:14.291
Even when they don't deserve it.

makes them want to be that best version.

Yeah.

1:31:22.083 --> 1:31:23.125

When we said goodbye,
he didn't step up for me.

1:31:28.583 --> 1:31:31.208

1:31:31.291 --> 1:31:34.125
the horse is already out of the barn.

1:31:41.333 --> 1:31:43.958
Well, actually, Uruguay
is a rising star in the wine world.

1:31:44.041 --> 1:31:47.125
Its mild maritime climate is ideal
for grape growing.

1:31:47.208 --> 1:31:49.750
And the women
of the wine collective we're representing

1:31:49.833 --> 1:31:51.208
are known for their red varietals.

1:31:51.291 --> 1:31:54.125
Even their award-winning Tent Flint.

I'm the one who blew it.

1:32:40.750 --> 1:32:42.541
What… What are you doing here?

1:32:43.333 --> 1:32:45.041
I'm not a silent partner anymore.

1:32:46.958 --> 1:32:49.416
The reaction to the new label
is through the roof.

1:32:49.500 --> 1:32:52.833
Salud Imports is exactly
what Vaughn Family Wines needs.

1:32:54.125 --> 1:32:55.416
[Audra] She accepts.

1:32:55.500 --> 1:32:56.750
We're your new importer.

1:33:02.125 --> 1:33:05.041
And I'm not just here on business.

1:33:07.666 --> 1:33:09.250
Baaabra misses you.

1:33:09.333 --> 1:33:10.958
[Max laughing]

1:33:11.666 --> 1:33:15.041
Sadly, it's true.
She mopes all around her pen all day.

1:33:15.125 --> 1:33:17.958
And she won't even wear her scarf anymore.
She's miserable.

1:33:18.041 --> 1:33:20.666
So you came all this way
to give me an update on Baaabra?

1:33:20.750 --> 1:33:22.166
[Max] Mm-hmm. [chuckles]

1:33:23.375 --> 1:33:24.208
No.

1:33:25.666 --> 1:33:27.833
I came all this way
to say I'm done hiding out.

1:33:29.375 --> 1:33:30.791
You never gave up, Lola.

1:33:30.875 --> 1:33:32.625
But somewhere along the way,

1:33:33.958 --> 1:33:34.791
I did.

1:33:39.416 --> 1:33:41.041
I was a fool to let you go.

1:33:43.291 --> 1:33:44.541
So here I am.

1:33:44.625 --> 1:33:47.416
Go big or go home. Right?

1:33:47.500 --> 1:33:49.208
Shut up and kiss me already.

1:34:52.083 --> 1:34:53.250

-Look at you go.
-Right?

1:34:55.833 --> 1:34:58.208
-That was very good.
-Thank you. Thank you.
