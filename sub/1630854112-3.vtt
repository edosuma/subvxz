Athena?

00:33.200 --> 00:34.516
That pan is still wet.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.518
You need to dry it off
before you put it away.

00:36.612 --> 00:38.445
Why? It'll dry eventually.

00:38.597 --> 00:40.280
Because it'll rust.

00:40.432 --> 00:42.857
That's my good cast iron.

00:42.877 --> 00:45.693
And don't you roll
those eyes at me.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.604
Sorry, Mama.

00:47.697 --> 00:49.531
When's Daddy getting home?

00:49.550 --> 00:51.291
Oh, I see.

00:51.368 --> 00:52.867
You only offered to help
with the dishes

00:53.036 --> 00:54.461
so you could wait up
for your father.

00:54.613 --> 00:56.947
Well, yeah.
Who likes doing dishes?

00:56.965 --> 00:58.039
Besides you.

00:58.133 --> 01:00.117
I like it because it's usually

01:00.210 --> 01:01.952
my peaceful time by myself.

01:02.045 --> 01:04.137
One day when you're grown,

01:04.290 --> 01:05.956
you'll understand.

01:05.974 --> 01:07.382
-(door opens)
-SAMUEL: I'm home.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.310
-(door closes)
-Saved by your daddy again.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.737
Daddy!

01:11.964 --> 01:13.847
-You missed dinner.
-Oh...

01:13.908 --> 01:15.799
Oh, I know, baby girl.

01:15.818 --> 01:19.286
-Daddy got a flat tire
on the way home.
-(chuckles)

01:20.489 --> 01:22.081
Mm. Ooh.

01:22.308 --> 01:24.732
Is that why you smell like
a greasy mechanic?

01:24.827 --> 01:27.252
And look at this shirt.
It's filthy.

01:27.404 --> 01:28.662
Well, you want me to take it off
so you can wash it?

01:28.756 --> 01:30.147
'Cause you know I got

01:30.165 --> 01:32.091
-no problem with that.
-(laughs): Oh, Samuel Carter,

01:32.242 --> 01:34.259
-get those filthy paws off me.
-What? I can't help it.

01:34.486 --> 01:36.911
(scoffs)
And you, little girl--

01:36.931 --> 01:39.323
it is officially
past your bedtime.

01:39.341 --> 01:41.825
What about story time?
Daddy always

01:41.918 --> 01:43.160
tells me a story before bed.

01:43.178 --> 01:44.661
I know, baby.

01:44.830 --> 01:46.330
Daddy got home too late.

01:46.348 --> 01:48.440
But I promise
I will make it up to you.

01:48.667 --> 01:51.193
Tomorrow we will read
two stories.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.321
And waffles for breakfast?

01:57.192 --> 01:59.042
And waffles for breakfast.

01:59.044 --> 02:01.102
-(giggles)
-BEATRICE: Some lawyer you are.

02:01.122 --> 02:03.438
You just got out-negotiated
by a nine-year-old.

02:03.532 --> 02:04.865
I'm a tough cookie.

02:05.017 --> 02:06.608
That's what Daddy
always tells me.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.369
Just like her mother.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.613
(sighs)
Go.

Samuel! Beatrice!

BEATRICE:
Patrice? What's the matter?

02:31.226 --> 02:33.393
PATRICE:
Is Tanya here? She's gone.
We can't find her.

02:33.545 --> 02:36.380
BEATRICE:
Patrice, slow down.
What do you mean, she's gone?

02:36.473 --> 02:38.882
PATRICE:
She's not in the house.
She wasn't in her bed.

02:38.901 --> 02:40.642
BEATRICE:
Where would she go?

02:40.661 --> 02:42.052
I don't understand.

02:42.070 --> 02:44.388
-What's happening?
-Tanya's missing.

02:44.406 --> 02:45.980
PATRICE:
When Joanne to check on her
she wasn't in her bed.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.408
It was empty.
Their window was open.

02:48.560 --> 02:49.893
-(cries out)
-SAMUEL: Did you check
the backyard?

02:50.062 --> 02:51.319
These kids are
always doing stuff

02:51.338 --> 02:52.746
-they're not supposed to.
-Me and Lloyd

02:52.898 --> 02:54.564
have looked everywhere.
She just vanished.

02:54.583 --> 02:55.841
-I'll get a search group
together.
-Hey, come on.

02:56.068 --> 02:57.234
Okay, it's okay,
it's gonna be all right.

02:57.252 --> 02:59.569
Patrice, go back to the house.

02:59.738 --> 03:01.905
-Wait there in case she shows.
-PATRICE: Yes.

03:01.924 --> 03:03.590
Beatrice.

03:03.759 --> 03:05.333
Call the sheriff, give them

03:05.352 --> 03:07.744
the Kingston's address,
let 'em know what's going on.

03:07.763 --> 03:09.079
I just have this sick feeling

03:09.097 --> 03:10.338
that something's
happened to her.

03:10.432 --> 03:12.340
-No.
-I can feel it in my bones.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.675
Don't go there.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.918
Athena.

03:15.011 --> 03:18.697
Go back to your room
and get in bed. Now!

03:26.373 --> 03:29.291
BEATRICE:
I thought your father
told you to go back to bed.

03:32.104 --> 03:34.129
(window closes)

03:35.549 --> 03:37.466
I'm scared.

03:38.293 --> 03:40.627
You don't have to be scared.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.280
I am right here.

03:43.298 --> 03:45.131
What happened to Tanya?

03:45.226 --> 03:47.309
Why did Daddy grab his gun?

03:48.896 --> 03:50.971
Tanya's parents
don't know where she is.

03:51.123 --> 03:53.957
Your father went out
to help them find her.

03:53.976 --> 03:56.050
Did something bad happen to her?

03:56.144 --> 03:57.827
We don't know yet.

03:57.829 --> 03:59.887
But you know
what you can do to help?

03:59.907 --> 04:01.573
Pray.

04:01.766 --> 04:03.133
Why don't you say a prayer

04:03.226 --> 04:06.653
asking God to bring Tanya home
safe and sound.

04:06.730 --> 04:08.638
You remember what I told you?

04:08.732 --> 04:10.898
That God answers prayers.

04:11.067 --> 04:12.325
That's right.

04:12.478 --> 04:15.712
Please let Him answer this one.

04:17.816 --> 04:21.260
Now try and get
some sleep, okay?

04:31.921 --> 04:33.830
MAN (in distance):
Tanya!

04:33.923 --> 04:35.682
MAN 2:
Tanya! Tanya!

04:35.834 --> 04:37.517
-WOMAN: Tanya!
-MAN 3: Tanya!

04:37.669 --> 04:40.520
-Tanya!
-WOMAN: Tanya, can you hear me?

04:40.597 --> 04:43.673
MEN:
Hello? Tanya? Do you hear me?

04:43.692 --> 04:44.783
-Tanya!

04:44.934 --> 04:47.511
-MAN 2: Tanya!
-MAN 3: Tanya!

04:47.529 --> 04:49.270

-MAN 2: Tanya!

04:49.290 --> 04:52.349
-MAN: Tanya!
-MAN 3: Tanya!

04:52.367 --> 04:54.668
(monitor beeping steadily)

04:58.132 --> 05:00.299
BEATRICE:
Why aren't you doing anything?

05:00.450 --> 05:01.875
You're just standing there,
letting that man

05:02.027 --> 05:03.710
treat your father
like a criminal.

05:03.862 --> 05:05.620
This is protocol, Mama.

05:05.789 --> 05:07.547
He's doing his job.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.308
Mrs. Carter?

05:09.535 --> 05:11.885
The detective
is almost done in there.

05:12.037 --> 05:13.478
This isn't right
and you know it.

05:13.630 --> 05:15.722
Your father can't speak
or defend himself.

05:15.799 --> 05:18.208
He can't even consent
to what they're doing.

05:18.301 --> 05:19.967
They don't need consent, Mama.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.728
That's what the warrant is for.

05:21.880 --> 05:24.214
PINO:
Well, everything else aside,

05:24.383 --> 05:25.807
Mr. Carter is showing
signs of improvement.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.827
His blood pressure has been
stable for the last 24 hours.

05:28.978 --> 05:31.145
The swelling in his brain
has gone down considerably.

05:31.165 --> 05:33.999
-Enough to maybe bring him
out of the coma?
-That's what we're hoping.

05:34.226 --> 05:35.575
I'll keep you posted.

05:35.727 --> 05:37.085
Thank you.

05:38.730 --> 05:42.232
The police are gonna
want to talk to him as soon

05:42.325 --> 05:45.844
-as he wakes up.
-You keep these people
away from your father.

05:46.071 --> 05:47.346
Look at what
they're doing to him.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.163
BOBBY:
Beatrice, I know
this is difficult,

05:49.183 --> 05:50.590
but the police are just doing

05:50.684 --> 05:53.243
what they have to, and
gathering samples is probably

05:53.261 --> 05:55.428
the best way to prove
that Samuel is innocent.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.930
He's right.

05:57.006 --> 05:58.415
Mrs. Carter, Mrs. Nash.

05:58.508 --> 05:59.599
Detective Clifford Dixon.

05:59.751 --> 06:02.919
You people should be
ashamed of yourselves.

06:03.012 --> 06:06.439
The police department
did nothing for 45 years

06:06.533 --> 06:08.867
to find that girl,
now you want to pin it

06:09.018 --> 06:11.185
on a sick, incapacitated man.

06:11.205 --> 06:14.021
My husband did not
do what you're accusing him of.

06:14.041 --> 06:17.209
Ma'am, we haven't
accused him of anything.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.768
Yet.

06:18.787 --> 06:21.713
We just want to get to the
truth, like I'm sure you do.

06:21.940 --> 06:24.941
Because you're right,
45 years is a long time.

06:24.960 --> 06:27.219
And the Kingston family
deserves some justice.

06:27.446 --> 06:28.720
So what happens next?

06:28.797 --> 06:30.947
We're still sorting through
the evidence and samples

06:30.966 --> 06:32.982
from the scene,
but once we have forensics,

06:32.984 --> 06:35.936
we can test Mr. Carter's sample
against it.

06:36.638 --> 06:38.212
And I'd like to get you

06:38.306 --> 06:40.306
and your mother down to
the station to give statements.

06:40.459 --> 06:42.459
I know it was long time ago, but

06:42.552 --> 06:44.644
anything you might remember from
that night could be helpful.

06:44.796 --> 06:46.312
Not without a lawyer.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.740
DIXON:
That's fine.
At your earliest convenience.

06:48.967 --> 06:50.575
Can I give you
some free advice, though?

06:50.802 --> 06:52.469
Can I say "no thank you"?

06:52.562 --> 06:54.579
Let go of your
emotional attachment.

06:54.806 --> 06:56.564
Let us do our jobs.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.065
Just be his daughter.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.502
Not a police officer.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.316
ATHENA: Right. I know.

07:06.334 --> 07:07.984
Oh, no, he's over there.

07:08.077 --> 07:09.928
(stammers) Yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.172
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, Michael.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.765
I'm telling you, do not come.

07:13.992 --> 07:16.342
No, keep Harry there
with you and David.

07:16.495 --> 07:18.828
He does not
need to be here for this.

07:18.847 --> 07:21.756
Look, I got to go.
We just got back to the house.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.334
Kiss Harry for me.

07:24.427 --> 07:26.002
Okay, bye.

07:26.021 --> 07:27.353
Junior's here.

07:27.448 --> 07:30.198
ATHENA:
And he brought his father.

07:38.107 --> 07:39.607
I am so sorry.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.126
One shock after another.

07:41.353 --> 07:43.369
Still doesn't feel real.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.038
Mr. Franklin.

07:45.114 --> 07:47.707
Aw, it's good to see you.

07:47.859 --> 07:48.967
It's been a while.

07:49.194 --> 07:52.286
I would say it's good
to see you, too, but...

07:52.380 --> 07:54.806
not under these circumstances.

07:54.883 --> 07:57.124
-How you holding up?
-Oh, best we can.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.551
What about your mother?

07:58.628 --> 08:01.037
She's still at the hospital.
On top of everything,

08:01.130 --> 08:03.464
my father-- he's still
not out of the woods.

08:03.484 --> 08:05.132
She doesn't want
to leave his side.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.510
Of course. I wanted to come by

08:07.562 --> 08:09.212
when I heard
about Samuel's stroke.

08:09.231 --> 08:11.531
-But then I saw the news
last night.
-Mm.

08:11.641 --> 08:15.218
Anything me
or Junior can do to help,

08:15.237 --> 08:16.736
don't hesitate to ask.

08:16.905 --> 08:19.480
Now, who's this--
your bodyguard?

08:19.574 --> 08:22.167
Bobby Nash, my husband.

08:22.318 --> 08:23.484
Ah.

08:23.578 --> 08:26.004
-Nice to meet you, sir.
-Good to meet you.

08:26.081 --> 08:27.339
Glad you're here.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.566
She's gonna need
all the support she can get.

08:29.584 --> 08:31.843
Now, you built the original
structure, correct?

08:31.995 --> 08:33.586
Yeah.

08:33.739 --> 08:35.347
Laid the foundation myself.

08:35.498 --> 08:37.073
JUNIOR: Uh, the police
questioned him about it.

08:37.092 --> 08:38.742
We just got back
from the station.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.835
They swabbed me for the DNA.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.579
What do you remember?

08:42.597 --> 08:45.524
I was so young,
it's all kind of a blur.

08:45.751 --> 08:47.934
All I can tell you
is what I told the police.

08:48.086 --> 08:50.695
I poured that concrete,
left it to cure

08:50.847 --> 08:53.198
four, maybe five days.

08:53.349 --> 08:56.276
I remember it was so humid,
had to give it extra time.

08:56.370 --> 09:00.187
The job site
was exposed to the street.

09:00.265 --> 09:03.116
Anyone could have
put that girl in there.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.860
It was long time
before home security cameras.

09:05.879 --> 09:09.548
(chuckles) This Florida room
has been here so long,

09:09.699 --> 09:11.775
it's hard to remember
a time when it wasn't.

09:11.793 --> 09:12.942
Your mom had been on your dad

09:12.944 --> 09:14.277
for years to build
that addition.

09:14.370 --> 09:16.054
But he kept putting it off,

09:16.205 --> 09:17.614
saying he didn't have the money.

09:17.707 --> 09:20.541
Then one day,
he came by the shop.

09:20.635 --> 09:22.468
Said he changed his mind.

09:22.621 --> 09:25.638
Hmm, why the sudden
change of heart?

09:25.791 --> 09:27.140
You got to understand.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.885
When that girl disappeared,
it rocked this town.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.812
Nobody was the same after that.

09:32.964 --> 09:35.389
He said it'd be
a good distraction.

09:35.409 --> 09:38.893
A fun project
for you and Beatrice.

09:38.912 --> 09:42.038
When did he ask you to build it?

09:43.250 --> 09:47.127
The day after the Kingston girl
went missing.

09:48.330 --> 09:49.646
JUNIOR: We've taken up enough

09:49.739 --> 09:51.147
of your time.
We'll get out of your hair.

09:51.166 --> 09:54.426
But if you need anything at all,
we're here.

09:54.595 --> 09:55.910
-Oh, yeah.
-Thanks.

09:56.004 --> 09:57.745
Come on, Pops.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.514
I'm sorry, Athena.

10:00.583 --> 10:02.675
I really am.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.678
Thank you, Mr. Franklin.

10:05.831 --> 10:07.588
-See ya.
-Take care.

Okay.

10:16.599 --> 10:19.342
You doing all right?
I know I keep

10:19.361 --> 10:21.845
asking you, but I've just
been really worried about you.

10:21.938 --> 10:23.847
-(sighs)
-(car door closes)

10:23.940 --> 10:26.273
I'm not sure how I'm feeling.

-REGGIE: Y'all take care.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.295
What are...
what-what are you doing?

11:13.581 --> 11:15.581
I'm trying to see
if there's anything here

11:15.734 --> 11:16.824
that might shed some light.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.826
Did you know your father
was a meticulous

11:18.845 --> 11:21.087
record keeper? He keeps
all his old appointment books.

11:21.239 --> 11:23.515
Oh, no, put that away,
right now. All of it.

11:23.666 --> 11:25.909
This is not yours to do.

11:25.927 --> 11:27.668
You-you have no right
to go through

11:27.746 --> 11:29.170
my father's things like this.

11:29.264 --> 11:30.914
You're right, I don't.

11:31.082 --> 11:32.081
It should be you.

11:32.175 --> 11:34.267
What I don't understand
is why it's not.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.935
Why are you just standing
on the sidelines?

11:36.029 --> 11:38.029
Because that detective
was right.

11:38.256 --> 11:40.181
-I'm not a police officer here.
-Well, who cares

11:40.258 --> 11:42.108
what he said? Don't you want
to clear your father's name?

11:42.185 --> 11:43.593
-Of course I do...
-Athena, those doctors

11:43.611 --> 11:45.428
said they're gonna
take Samuel off sedation

11:45.447 --> 11:46.612
in two days,
and like you said,

11:46.707 --> 11:48.765
the police are gonna
be there waiting for him.

11:48.783 --> 11:50.875
Don't you want to be armed with
the truth when they do show up?

11:51.027 --> 11:53.503
What is it?
What are you so afraid of?

11:56.942 --> 11:59.718
I'm afraid
he could have done it.

12:15.143 --> 12:17.360

12:21.466 --> 12:23.533
(clears throat)

12:25.228 --> 12:26.411
GIRL:
There's that girl.

12:26.638 --> 12:27.912
The one whose little sister
got kidnapped.

12:28.064 --> 12:29.414
-Don't touch me.
-GIRL 2: Her name is Joanne.

12:29.565 --> 12:31.307
I heard she got
kicked out of school.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.752
-JOANNE: I said let go!
-PATRICE: Have you
lost your mind?

12:33.903 --> 12:35.661
JOANNE:
Oh, don't pretend
you all of a sudden care

12:35.756 --> 12:38.089
-about the one kid
you have left.
-PATRICE: Stop it.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.907
Why are you always
making my life so hard?

12:40.001 --> 12:41.575
After everything
I've been through.

12:41.595 --> 12:42.819
JOANNE:
Oh, right, because you're

12:42.912 --> 12:44.411
the only one
this has happened to.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.656
You know what, I think Daddy
died just to get away from you.

12:46.674 --> 12:50.009
Okay, how about we try
to calm down here?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.512
Shut up, Barney Fife.

12:52.664 --> 12:54.664
Maybe you should try
looking for my sister

12:54.682 --> 12:56.107
instead of harassing me.

12:56.259 --> 12:57.925
You people are worthless.

12:58.019 --> 12:59.319
Shut up.

13:06.102 --> 13:08.077

Oh, hey there, little lady.
I hope

13:14.795 --> 13:16.519
-you're being careful out there.
-Why does everyone

13:16.612 --> 13:18.187
keep saying that
you're bad at your job?

13:18.281 --> 13:20.614
Is it because
you haven't found Tanya?

13:20.634 --> 13:23.968
You shouldn't listen
to everything everybody says.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.696
Was Tanya your friend?

13:26.714 --> 13:29.048
I saw her at school
all the time and church.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.810
-Are you still looking for her?
-Of course we are.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.720
The truth is
this is a really hard case.

13:34.889 --> 13:37.540
We don't have a lot of clues
to help us find her.

13:37.633 --> 13:39.225
And you need clues.

13:39.377 --> 13:40.893
Like a barrette in the woods.

13:41.046 --> 13:44.638
-How'd you know about that?
-I heard my dad
talking about it.

13:44.807 --> 13:46.065
Is that the only clue you have?

13:46.159 --> 13:48.142
Well, the only other thing
we know is that somebody

13:48.161 --> 13:50.570
climbed in through that
bedroom window and took her.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.479
What about Joanne?

13:52.648 --> 13:53.906
Why did you arrest her?

13:53.983 --> 13:55.983
You sure do ask
a lot of questions.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.560
I like to know stuff.

13:57.653 --> 13:59.170
I didn't arrest her.

13:59.322 --> 14:01.155
I was just making sure
she got home safe.

14:01.249 --> 14:03.490
She's having a hard time.

14:03.585 --> 14:05.492
I wish I could
help her and her mom.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.919

that night.

-I'm sure it wasn't
the first time.
-Yeah, when he came in,

15:05.313 --> 15:07.313
his shirt was all dirty.

15:07.465 --> 15:09.982
He said he had a flat tire.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.984
I mean, I remember because

15:12.078 --> 15:14.746
my father was always
such a sharp dresser.

15:14.897 --> 15:17.248
And that night
he was disheveled.

15:17.475 --> 15:19.733
I wasn't used
to seeing him like that.

15:19.827 --> 15:22.253
But you said he was
out helping with the search.

of a coincidence.
-Yeah, but

15:32.674 --> 15:35.082
this is your father we're
talking about. He raised you.

-of doing anything
remotely like this.

with a killer,

15:51.342 --> 15:52.766
and they had no idea.

15:52.860 --> 15:54.677
The devil wears a familiar face

15:54.770 --> 15:56.512

to the police
to arrest my father?

16:23.708 --> 16:26.800
I can't be the one
to send my father to prison.

it being loose back then,

19:06.537 --> 19:08.479
-from climbing in.

He's right.

19:19.308 --> 19:23.494
You used to sneak
out of this window, didn't you?

Did you sneak out that night?

Yes.

21:57.208 --> 21:58.816
She doesn't miss a beat.

21:58.893 --> 22:00.735
Be grateful
you're an only child.

22:01.970 --> 22:04.046
30 minutes.
That's it.

22:04.065 --> 22:05.381
Then you have to leave.

22:05.474 --> 22:08.050
30 minutes?
That's no time. An hour.

22:08.219 --> 22:10.328
30 minutes and I'll...

22:10.404 --> 22:12.997
take you to the movies
on Saturday.

22:14.167 --> 22:16.983
Oh, come on, Tanya,
stop being so difficult.

22:17.745 --> 22:20.671
-I get to pick the movie.
-Fine.

Yeah.

23:51.839 --> 23:53.914
I know you're not really asleep.

23:53.933 --> 23:57.726
You thought about what movie
you want to see on Saturday?

24:01.515 --> 24:03.332

The silent treatment?

24:03.425 --> 24:05.526

Come on, Tanya.

<i> I never saw her leave.</i>

24:24.964 --> 24:28.632
<i> Just assumed she made it home.</i>

24:30.194 --> 24:33.453
And you lied
to the police back then?

24:33.547 --> 24:36.140
Lied to my parents, too.

24:37.034 --> 24:39.051
Told them that she was gone

24:39.203 --> 24:41.720
when I checked on her.

24:41.797 --> 24:44.464
They saw the window was open.

24:44.484 --> 24:47.226
It was easier
to let them believe that.

24:47.378 --> 24:50.529
Then they told the police
what happened.

24:54.218 --> 24:56.309
It was my fault.

24:56.996 --> 25:01.223
If I hadn't snuck out
that night,

25:01.225 --> 25:03.501
she'd still be here.

25:03.652 --> 25:06.003
-(siren wailing in distance)
-Joanne.

25:06.154 --> 25:09.064
You don't know that.

25:09.066 --> 25:11.258
Did you call the police?

25:12.586 --> 25:14.661
You were trespassing.

25:14.755 --> 25:17.056
(car doors close)

25:18.834 --> 25:20.518
It's okay, everything's fine.

25:20.669 --> 25:22.745
I'm not gonna press charges.

25:22.763 --> 25:24.504
Not sure that's up to you now.

25:24.524 --> 25:27.007
Mrs. Nash, I thought
we had an understanding

25:27.101 --> 25:28.600
that you were gonna
let us do our job.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.085
ATHENA:
We were just leaving.

25:30.178 --> 25:32.345
We came by to offer
our condolences to Joanne.

25:32.365 --> 25:33.847
-That's all.
-Is that right?

25:33.866 --> 25:36.182
Because it looks a lot like
your wife is interfering

25:36.202 --> 25:38.035
with an active investigation.

25:38.262 --> 25:39.352
How about you come with me?

25:39.372 --> 25:41.187
Wait a minute,
you're arresting her?

25:41.282 --> 25:43.958
In all fairness,
you were warned.

25:59.559 --> 26:02.059
(engine starts)

26:10.127 --> 26:11.551
<i> BOBBY:</i>
<i> Can't imagine they'd book her.</i>

26:11.645 --> 26:14.405
Question her, sure,
but she'll still need a lawyer.

26:15.316 --> 26:18.016
Okay. Thanks.
I will meet you there.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.744
I'm sorry
I got Athena in trouble.

26:20.896 --> 26:23.747
Well, she can handle it,
she's a police officer herself.

26:23.974 --> 26:27.418
Well, that explains it.
(chuckles)

26:27.569 --> 26:29.645
I want you to know that Athena's
probably gonna tell the police

26:29.663 --> 26:32.405
what you told us: that Tanya
wasn't taken from home.

26:32.425 --> 26:35.500
That's new information that'll
probably be helpful to them.

26:35.653 --> 26:37.595
(sighs)

26:37.746 --> 26:39.988
There's something else.

26:40.007 --> 26:41.840
That car we heard--

26:41.934 --> 26:44.584
we couldn't see it
from where we were hiding,

26:44.604 --> 26:46.604
but the sound it made,

26:46.680 --> 26:48.513
it was like a "put-put-put."

26:48.666 --> 26:50.774
I'd never heard a car
sound like that before.

26:50.926 --> 26:52.926
Okay, that's good to note.

26:53.095 --> 26:54.445
I'll bring that up
to Detective Dixon.

26:54.596 --> 26:56.521
Listen, Joanne,
you take care of yourself.

26:56.674 --> 26:58.490
And lock that thing up.

27:00.268 --> 27:02.435
<i> DIXON:</i>
<i> So, what were you doing</i>
<i> talking to Joanne Kingston?</i>

27:02.529 --> 27:04.513
One could think
it was intimidation.

27:04.606 --> 27:06.181
And one would be wrong.

27:06.274 --> 27:09.109
Did you know that Tanya
wasn't taken from her house

27:09.128 --> 27:10.944
like the Kingstons reported?

27:10.963 --> 27:13.279
-Did Joanne tell you that?
-She did.

27:13.374 --> 27:16.041
That night, she snuck out,
and Tanya followed her.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.360
All this time, you've been
trying to solve this case

27:18.379 --> 27:21.597
-with wrong information.
-Not all of us.

27:28.648 --> 27:30.389
The barrettes.

27:30.541 --> 27:32.541
I got three little girls
at home.

27:32.559 --> 27:34.634
They never go to bed
with their barrettes.

27:34.728 --> 27:37.303
Always complaining to my wife
about how much it hurts.

27:37.398 --> 27:39.047
If she was taken from her sleep,
I don't think

27:39.066 --> 27:41.400
she would have
been wearing those.

27:41.552 --> 27:43.568
Well...

27:43.737 --> 27:46.080
I guess I confirmed it.

27:47.482 --> 27:48.982
You're welcome.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.316
Thank you.

27:51.245 --> 27:54.588
Is that the forensic report
from the scene?

28:01.588 --> 28:03.405
What else was found
with the remains?

28:03.498 --> 28:04.573
Not much.

28:04.666 --> 28:05.516
Few scraps of cloth,

28:05.667 --> 28:07.017
the barrettes, plastic.

28:07.244 --> 28:08.852
Everything else
was disintegrated.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.504
What about this?
What is it?

28:11.524 --> 28:15.267
Old-timers think it's a clasp
from a harvesting bag.

28:15.343 --> 28:17.269
Like they use
for picking oranges.

28:17.363 --> 28:21.089
Bags back then were canvas,
so the clasp is all that's left.

28:21.183 --> 28:23.442
The killer could have used
something like this

28:23.536 --> 28:24.776
to transport her.

28:24.929 --> 28:27.095
-It's possible.
-DNA?

28:27.097 --> 28:28.113
Nothing.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.023
Nothing to compare
your father's sample to

28:30.117 --> 28:31.633
or Reggie Senior's.

28:31.693 --> 28:33.936
Either it was wiped clean
or, more likely,

28:33.954 --> 28:35.713
the hydrated lime
in the concrete

28:35.864 --> 28:38.106
eroded any DNA that was present.

28:38.125 --> 28:40.033
Hydrated lime.

28:40.127 --> 28:42.886
That's usually mixed in
with the concrete, yes?

28:43.038 --> 28:44.722
-Typically.
-The levels here--

28:44.949 --> 28:46.890
it looks like
she was doused in it.

28:47.042 --> 28:49.134
Like someone
poured the lime all over her,

28:49.286 --> 28:52.788
then covered her body
in the wet cement.

28:53.624 --> 28:55.983
-What's the difference?
-Reggie Senior.

28:57.127 --> 28:58.477
He said that he poured
the foundation,

28:58.571 --> 29:00.295
then left it to cure.
He said,

29:00.314 --> 29:04.408
"Anyone could have put
that little girl in there."

29:05.319 --> 29:08.579
That is a very deliberate
choice of words.

29:09.397 --> 29:11.473
Deliberate
because it wasn't true.

29:11.492 --> 29:12.750
Exactly.

29:12.977 --> 29:14.993
He covered her body
in quicklime,

29:15.087 --> 29:17.588
knowing that it would erode
all evidence,

29:17.739 --> 29:20.573
Then he encased her

29:20.667 --> 29:22.760
in cement.

29:23.596 --> 29:25.170
-(knocking)
-REGGIE: Knock, knock.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.747
-Special delivery.
-Reggie.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.841
What a wonderful surprise.

29:30.010 --> 29:31.843
Just came by to see
how you were doing.

29:31.996 --> 29:33.662
And bring
a little something to eat.

29:33.680 --> 29:37.065
-Got to keep your strength up.
-Well, thank you.

29:40.504 --> 29:41.520
How is he?

29:41.672 --> 29:43.263
Improving.

29:43.282 --> 29:46.933
They're hoping to take him off
sedation in another day or two.

29:47.027 --> 29:48.176
That so?

29:48.195 --> 29:50.846
Seems like a lifetime.

29:50.864 --> 29:52.456
Waiting like this.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.850
Not knowing, and then,

29:54.868 --> 29:57.277
with everything else...

29:57.296 --> 29:58.870
Beatrice.

29:59.023 --> 30:00.446
I am so sorry.

30:00.541 --> 30:02.874
It shouldn't
be happening to you.

30:02.968 --> 30:04.709
You and Samuel.

30:04.786 --> 30:06.470
You don't deserve this.

30:06.621 --> 30:09.548
Samuel is a good man.

30:09.700 --> 30:11.642
You know it.

30:11.869 --> 30:13.793
The whole town knows it.

30:13.887 --> 30:16.538
To have his legacy
tainted like this

30:16.631 --> 30:17.981
after all he's done.

30:18.133 --> 30:20.225
REGGIE:
I wish I could take it away.

30:20.986 --> 30:23.320
I wish I could make it right.

30:23.471 --> 30:25.564
You're not the one
making my husband out

30:25.716 --> 30:27.382
to be some kind of killer.

30:27.401 --> 30:29.618
I'm sorry.

30:31.664 --> 30:34.623

Someone would have noticed

you let her drink.

sent you home like that.

34:16.463 --> 34:19.114
It's cool. We can have
our own little party.

34:19.132 --> 34:21.349
(chuckles)

34:24.121 --> 34:26.621
Yeah, I'm sick of her
treating me like a baby.

34:26.714 --> 34:28.306
That's right.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.624
You're a big girl.

34:29.717 --> 34:33.528

starting to fill out.

34:38.302 --> 34:40.059
I don't feel well.

34:40.153 --> 34:43.638
It's okay. You're just
not used to the alcohol.

34:43.657 --> 34:45.749
Relax.

34:45.900 --> 34:48.251
-Please stop.
I don't like that.
-Don't be like that.

34:48.478 --> 34:50.328
I'm just trying to help you.

34:50.480 --> 34:51.571

Yeah.

Athena?

-No.

How do I not
protect my boy?

39:52.966 --> 39:54.724
I'm his father.
That's my job.

39:54.876 --> 39:57.969

more than your own son?
-Just go.

What is this?

This is what comes

40:08.298 --> 40:11.032
of you protecting your boy.

40:20.067 --> 40:22.401
DIXON:
We searched your son's workshop.

40:22.495 --> 40:24.754
He didn't stop
with Tanya Kingston.

40:26.816 --> 40:29.008
He said it was an accident.

40:29.911 --> 40:32.679
Said he didn't mean to do it.

40:35.267 --> 40:37.492
I just wanted to protect him.

40:37.585 --> 40:40.603
Too bad you never thought
about protecting them.

40:42.274 --> 40:43.848
<i> JOANNE:</i>
<i> Six girls?</i>

40:44.000 --> 40:46.851
And they're not done searching.

40:46.945 --> 40:50.113
Oh, I still can't believe it.

40:50.340 --> 40:52.023
You know, the next day
after she was gone,

40:52.117 --> 40:53.116
he came over.

40:53.343 --> 40:55.768
Wanted to see how I was doing.

40:55.862 --> 40:58.179
I thought it was
because he cared.

40:58.198 --> 41:01.899
He just wanted to see
if I knew anything.

41:01.960 --> 41:05.687
Have you given any thought
to what comes next?

41:05.855 --> 41:07.755
I don't know.

41:09.859 --> 41:11.968
Sell the house, maybe.

41:13.697 --> 41:14.954
Fresh start.

41:15.865 --> 41:18.808
Only reason I stayed was
in case she came home one day.

41:18.960 --> 41:21.719
Guess I never
gave up hope, either.

41:21.796 --> 41:24.564
Well, hope is a good thing.

41:26.634 --> 41:29.134
It always feels like
everyone forgot about her.

41:29.154 --> 41:32.638
People searched the first
couple of months, but then

41:32.657 --> 41:34.699
they went on with their lives.

41:36.495 --> 41:38.477
Not everyone forgot.

41:38.571 --> 41:40.054
I didn't.

41:40.147 --> 41:42.573
Tanya may have
only been on this earth

41:42.726 --> 41:43.816
for eight short years,

41:43.943 --> 41:46.836
but she had a big impact.

41:47.731 --> 41:50.465
