WEBVTT

00:01.518 --> 00:04.349
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.487 --> 00:07.386
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.524 --> 00:12.046
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:12.184 --> 00:15.015
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:15.153 --> 00:17.914
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:18.052 --> 00:22.022
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.713 --> 00:26.129
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.267 --> 00:28.821
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.959 --> 00:31.376
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.514 --> 00:34.137
Just to get up that hill

00:34.275 --> 00:36.657
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.795 --> 00:39.246
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.384 --> 00:41.731
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.869 --> 00:43.457
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.595 --> 00:46.218
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.356 --> 00:49.256
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.394 --> 00:53.812
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.950 --> 00:56.677
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.815 --> 00:59.680
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.818 --> 01:06.204
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:09.483 --> 01:12.382
Child, you should
have seen that hat
she had on.

01:12.520 --> 01:14.246
Ugly!

01:16.076 --> 01:18.699
Girl, it looked like
an explosion
in a fruit market.

01:19.769 --> 01:20.942
Florence, my breakfast.

01:21.426 --> 01:22.392
Shh.

01:23.911 --> 01:25.430
Oh, that ain't nobody,
just Mr. Jefferson.

01:27.673 --> 01:29.606
Honey, I'm sorry
you missed that
skimpy dress

01:29.744 --> 01:31.505
she wore yesterday.

01:31.643 --> 01:35.543
Girl, let me tell you.
She was showing everything
but her credit cards.

01:37.683 --> 01:39.168
I want my breakfast!

01:39.306 --> 01:41.411
I'm on the phone.

01:41.549 --> 01:42.516
So, anyway,
what did you say?

01:42.654 --> 01:44.483
I said
I want my breakfast!

01:44.621 --> 01:46.899
Not you, her.

01:47.037 --> 01:49.212
So, anyway, child,
if I see her today...
Give me that.

01:49.350 --> 01:51.904
Hello, excuse me, uh,
Florence was just called out.

01:52.042 --> 01:53.251
This is her
answering service.

01:53.389 --> 01:54.562
If you want to leave
a message

01:54.700 --> 01:56.254
you may do so
at the sound
of the beep.

01:56.392 --> 01:57.358
Beep!

02:01.397 --> 02:03.744
I can't even make
a phone call
around here.

02:03.882 --> 02:05.780
Look, this is my house,
that is my phone

02:05.918 --> 02:07.782
and I want my waffles.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.267
Well, it ain't too hard.

02:09.405 --> 02:11.131
You could've
got 'em yourself.

02:13.236 --> 02:15.652
Those are frozen waffles.
I want the real ones.

02:15.790 --> 02:17.171
Then hire Aunt Jemima.

02:20.899 --> 02:23.004
George, I'm leaving now.
See you later.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.420
Weezy, wait, wait.
Come here, come here,
come, here. Look.

02:24.558 --> 02:25.559
Look.

02:25.697 --> 02:27.733
Frozen waffles,
frozen orange juice

02:27.871 --> 02:29.563
and freeze dried coffee.

02:29.701 --> 02:32.669
I'm paying her to
watch my food defrost.

02:32.807 --> 02:34.361
You mind if I have
your orange juice?

02:34.499 --> 02:35.741
Weezy, you ain't
even listening.

02:36.121 --> 02:37.502
Yes, I am.

02:37.640 --> 02:39.538
Oh, George,
that's a terrible diet.

02:39.676 --> 02:41.609
You're not eating
enough fiber.

02:41.747 --> 02:43.715
Fiber? I don't want
no rope to eat, either.

02:45.268 --> 02:47.822
I can't talk now, George.
I'm in such a rush.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.997
You running off
to that museum again?

02:50.135 --> 02:53.242
No, this time I thought
I'd take a cab.

02:53.380 --> 02:54.657
Weezy, wait!

02:54.795 --> 02:56.590
Where did
I put my keys?

02:56.728 --> 02:59.731
Weezy, you've been
running to that museum
for three weeks now.

02:59.869 --> 03:02.112
Why do you wanna study
Indian culture anyway?

03:02.251 --> 03:03.666
Because they were
the first Americans.

03:03.804 --> 03:05.633
What have you got
against Indians?

03:05.771 --> 03:09.396
I'm a businessman, Weezy.
I'm against anything
that's in the red.

03:12.226 --> 03:14.504
Will you stand still?
I don't like talking
to the end

03:14.642 --> 03:15.919
that ain't
talking back.

03:17.749 --> 03:19.371
Okay, I've got you.
Found them.

03:19.509 --> 03:21.028
Look, Weezy,
you've been tearing
out of here

03:21.166 --> 03:23.858
day after day.
Now I want you
to give me a little time.

03:23.996 --> 03:25.515
Yeah, sure, George.
What is it?

03:25.653 --> 03:27.552
Oh, look at my lipstick.

03:27.690 --> 03:30.244
See, this is what happens
from hanging around with that
old crazy Helen Willis.

03:30.382 --> 03:33.523
She's the one that got you
mixed up in this whole museum
thing in the first place.

03:33.661 --> 03:36.526
All Helen did
was invite me to sit in
on a meeting.

03:36.664 --> 03:38.494
Why is she worried about
the Indians?

03:38.632 --> 03:40.461
She should be out doing
something that's
important to her.

03:40.599 --> 03:41.911
Like saving the zebras.

03:45.363 --> 03:48.366
George, I volunteered
because I enjoy it.

03:48.504 --> 03:50.264
And I've got
a lot of things to do
at the museum.

03:50.402 --> 03:51.990
Like what?

03:52.128 --> 03:54.268
Well, office work
for now.

03:54.406 --> 03:56.201
But some day I'd like
to work in the field.

03:56.339 --> 03:59.791
Weezy, are you crazy?
It took us 200 years
to get out of the field.

04:02.897 --> 04:06.832
I'm talking about
the places where they
dig for Indian artifacts.

04:06.970 --> 04:10.733
You, of all people,
should know the value
of preserving old relics.

04:13.045 --> 04:14.461
Me? Why me?

04:15.393 --> 04:17.464
You still support
your mother, don't you?

04:20.881 --> 04:23.470
Now, Weezy,
that was cold.

04:23.608 --> 04:28.406
You deserved that, George.
You make fun of all
of my projects.

04:28.544 --> 04:31.650
My French lessons,
the Help Center...
My vitamins!

04:31.788 --> 04:33.825
What about your vitamins?
I forgot to take them.

04:33.963 --> 04:35.275
Oh, Weezy...

04:36.414 --> 04:38.105
You know why I make
fun of your projects?

04:38.243 --> 04:39.244
Because they're dumb.

04:40.245 --> 04:41.902
Well, what do you
want me to do?

04:42.040 --> 04:45.077
Stay here all day
getting ready for you
to come home?

04:45.215 --> 04:48.391
Then meet you at the door,
wrap my arms around you,

04:48.529 --> 04:52.119
and spend the rest of
the night making you
deliriously happy?

04:53.362 --> 04:54.915
I'd be willing
to try it for a month.

04:56.813 --> 04:58.643
Well, I wouldn't.

04:58.781 --> 04:59.747
That's telling him.

05:00.714 --> 05:03.579
Why is it everything
I wanna do is dumb?

05:04.200 --> 05:05.201
Yeah, why is it?

05:07.721 --> 05:11.103
And why is it
you're always against me
improving myself.

05:11.241 --> 05:12.242
Yeah, why is it?

05:15.936 --> 05:19.698
Any why is it other people's
husbands give them
encouragement and you don't.

05:20.181 --> 05:22.287
Yeah, why is it?

05:22.425 --> 05:25.117
Look, one more "Why is it?"
from you, and you're
gonna be wondering

05:25.255 --> 05:27.810
why is it you woke up
in another zip code area.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.917
Now look, Louise,
you listen...

05:32.055 --> 05:34.195
I have no time
to talk now, George.
We'll talk about it tonight.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.440
But, Weezy...
Look, Weezy, I'm not against
your Indian thing.

05:37.578 --> 05:39.166
It's just that
you're never home anymore.

05:42.549 --> 05:44.654
Louise, I finally
caught you at home.

05:44.792 --> 05:46.380
It's all your fault!

05:46.518 --> 05:48.589
I'm fine, thank you.
And how are you?

05:50.695 --> 05:52.421
It is not her fault!

05:52.559 --> 05:55.458
That's right. You always
blame me when something
goes wrong.

05:55.596 --> 05:57.598
Well, I am sick
and tired of it.

05:57.736 --> 06:00.532
This time you can
put the blame on
somebody else!

06:00.670 --> 06:02.189
Louise, what
are we talking about?

06:04.087 --> 06:07.228
George doesn't like me
putting in so much time
at the museum.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.609
Oh, is that
where you've been?

06:08.747 --> 06:09.990
I've been looking
all over for you.

06:10.128 --> 06:12.164
Well, goodbye, George.
I gotta go now. Bye, Helen.

06:12.302 --> 06:14.788
Weezy, will you wait...
Louise, wait.

06:14.926 --> 06:18.308
Hey, hold it.
There's a million things
I wanna talk to you about.

06:18.447 --> 06:22.243
I'll call you.
But you haven't been around
the Help Center for weeks.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.762
What about
the newsletter?

06:23.900 --> 06:26.765
I'd love to help,
but I'm just so busy.

06:26.903 --> 06:29.354
They've got me working
in the Indian Department.

06:29.975 --> 06:32.253
With Dr. Jessup?
Yes.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.946
That man could get me
to volunteer for anything.

06:36.085 --> 06:37.120
Oh!

06:37.258 --> 06:39.191
What are you working on
that's so important?

06:39.329 --> 06:43.506
Nothing special.
It is just that he's snowed
under with work,

06:43.644 --> 06:45.335
and I'm giving him
a hand.

06:45.922 --> 06:47.441
Oh! Oh!

06:47.579 --> 06:49.478
Oh, now the door
is closed.

06:51.894 --> 06:53.378
I've got to leave.

06:53.516 --> 06:56.036
I'm a half-hour
late already,
and I can't...

06:57.313 --> 06:59.522
Oh, darn!
Louise, wait.

06:59.660 --> 07:02.283
No, Helen, I've got to...

07:04.493 --> 07:08.013
If this is gonna take long,
we could send out
for a pizza.

07:09.325 --> 07:11.672
Oh, I am so sorry.

07:14.019 --> 07:15.849
Okay then,
what about lunch?

07:15.987 --> 07:17.367
I can always come
down there.

07:17.506 --> 07:20.405
It wouldn't work, Helen.
Bob and I don't eat
at a regular time.

07:20.543 --> 07:22.683
Oh, so now it's Bob.

07:22.821 --> 07:25.479
You have been
working hard.
Oh!

07:27.723 --> 07:30.553
Helen, I promise
I'll call you. Soon!

07:45.603 --> 07:49.952
Hey, Bob, I found it!
The piece we were missing.

07:50.090 --> 07:51.367
Oh, let me see...

07:55.026 --> 07:56.786
Oh, you're right.
Where was it?

07:56.924 --> 07:58.270
In the pile with
the rest of them.

07:58.408 --> 08:00.376
We had two number 12s.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.378
Oh, this is going to be
a great addition

08:02.516 --> 08:03.931
to our Navajo collection,
you know.

08:04.069 --> 08:08.177
Yeah, it's my favorite.
There's only one thing
I can't figure out.

08:08.315 --> 08:11.836
Why did the Navajos make
so many different
kinds of pottery?

08:11.974 --> 08:14.390
Oh, that's simple.
For garage sales.

08:17.117 --> 08:18.118
What?

08:18.636 --> 08:21.570
Oh, you.

08:21.708 --> 08:24.642
No, actually all of their
pottery had a use.

08:24.780 --> 08:26.816
Now this pot might
have held corn meal,

08:26.954 --> 08:31.165
or maybe the medicine man
used it to ask the spirits
for something.

08:31.303 --> 08:33.271
He should have asked
for a new pot.

08:35.307 --> 08:40.485
Louise, you are fantastic.
I don't know how I did
this job without you.

08:40.623 --> 08:45.179
Oh, I don't do much.
Just little things.
Fill out the cards...

08:45.317 --> 08:50.012
No, no, I mean it.
I have never seen
anyone so efficient.

08:50.150 --> 08:54.464
Oh, come on.
It's nothing.
I don't really...

09:00.678 --> 09:03.439
Louise, you must learn
to accept compliments,

09:03.577 --> 09:06.925
because that's what
you get around here
instead of money.

09:07.063 --> 09:08.548
Oh, well, I don't care
about that.

09:08.686 --> 09:11.205
I never really
expected to get
paid anyway.

09:11.343 --> 09:14.105
Oh, you see there?
Now, you even think
like an Indian.

09:14.243 --> 09:16.417
You know, a lot
of tribes didn't
have any money at all,

09:16.556 --> 09:18.488
and if they needed something,
they traded for it.

09:18.627 --> 09:21.906
Now for instance,
if a man wanted a wife,
it would cost him two horses.

09:22.044 --> 09:23.701
Well, what if he
wanted a horse?

09:23.839 --> 09:25.841
It would cost him
two wives.

09:28.395 --> 09:29.430
I'm sorry.

09:31.122 --> 09:32.744
Tell me, Louise,
what made you
get interested

09:32.882 --> 09:34.470
in Indians in the
first place, huh?

09:34.608 --> 09:37.611
Oh, I don't wanna tell you.
You'll think it's silly.

09:37.749 --> 09:41.097
Well, probably. But my
other choice is writing
a fund raising letter,

09:41.235 --> 09:42.651
so please go ahead.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.689
Well, it was all
because of a toy doll.

09:46.827 --> 09:49.347
When I was a little girl,
they didn't make black dolls.

09:49.485 --> 09:52.764
But I wanted one.
I kept pestering my father

09:52.902 --> 09:56.112
until one day he came home
with the closest thing
he could find.

09:56.250 --> 09:59.288
A little Indian princess.
Oh.

10:00.082 --> 10:00.979
Well, what's so funny?

10:01.601 --> 10:02.981
I was just thinking,

10:03.119 --> 10:06.675
I'll bet she was the only
Indian princess named Beulah.

10:08.780 --> 10:11.334
Well, I've certainly
never seen one.

10:11.472 --> 10:15.649
She really fascinated me,
that little princess, with her
long black hair,

10:15.787 --> 10:19.791
and her colorful beads.
All dressed in buckskin.

10:19.929 --> 10:23.726
I often wondered,
"Who were these people?"

10:23.864 --> 10:25.590
Well, Louise,
if you've had the
interest that long,

10:25.728 --> 10:27.730
you know, you should
go back to school
and take it up.

10:28.213 --> 10:29.629
Oh, I'm too old.

10:29.767 --> 10:32.321
Oh, come on now,
don't be ridiculous.
How old are you?

10:32.459 --> 10:37.429
Me? I'm old enough
to know better than
to answer that question.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.847
Oh, excuse me.

10:43.884 --> 10:45.541
Hello, Dr. Jessup speaking.

10:46.473 --> 10:48.855
No, no, it's all set up,
I'll be there.

10:48.993 --> 10:50.926
Yeah, you'll get my
report when I get back.

10:51.064 --> 10:52.652
Right. Bye-bye.

10:53.825 --> 10:54.861
You're going away?

10:55.309 --> 10:57.173
Yep. On a dig.

10:57.311 --> 10:59.244
A chemical plant
wants to build in
the Mohawk Valley,

10:59.382 --> 11:00.867
and the state asked us
to check it out,

11:01.005 --> 11:03.663
and make sure that
no sacred areas
are involved.

11:03.801 --> 11:07.045
Oh, it must be exciting
going to a real site.

11:07.183 --> 11:09.876
Oh, I tell you, it makes
it all worthwhile.

11:10.014 --> 11:13.258
Oh, I've never done
anything like that.

11:13.396 --> 11:14.915
Why... Why don't
you come along?

11:15.053 --> 11:16.572
Me? Oh, no, I...

11:16.710 --> 11:18.781
It's only for the weekend,
and you've learned
enough here.

11:18.919 --> 11:20.438
Oh, you'd be
a great help.

11:23.027 --> 11:25.063
You really think so?

11:25.201 --> 11:26.271
I wouldn't ask otherwise.

11:26.409 --> 11:27.548
Can you go?

11:27.687 --> 11:29.378
Well, sure.

11:29.516 --> 11:32.312
You know, I think
I'd really like that.
When is it?

11:32.450 --> 11:34.555
This weekend.
This weekend?

11:34.694 --> 11:37.489
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's okay.

11:37.627 --> 11:39.595
Oh, great.
That's great.

11:39.733 --> 11:44.117
Now you'll really see
what archeology
is really all about.

11:44.255 --> 11:46.602
I better check and see
you have all the gear
you need.

11:47.776 --> 11:49.467
Oh, Bob?
Yes, Louise?

11:49.605 --> 11:52.056
Who else is going?
Oh, just you and me.

12:00.927 --> 12:02.445
Will you get out here?

12:02.583 --> 12:04.620
We ain't finished
talking about this
camping trip, yet.

12:04.758 --> 12:05.794
Who are you
shouting at?

12:06.656 --> 12:08.141
Did you hear
a moose call?

12:10.868 --> 12:13.284
No.
Then why did
you come runnin'?

12:14.803 --> 12:16.874
Louise, I wanna
see you out here, now!

12:17.012 --> 12:18.668
LOUISE: Okay, okay!

12:33.304 --> 12:35.168
What kind of outfit
is that you're wearing?

12:36.514 --> 12:37.549
What are you
laughing at?

12:37.687 --> 12:40.656
This is what
you have to wear
in the woods.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.934
She's telling the truth,
child, 'cause I saw
that same outfit

12:43.072 --> 12:44.522
on Smokey the Bear.

12:46.455 --> 12:49.872
Look, Weezy,
you and this pile of junk
ain't going nowhere.

12:50.010 --> 12:51.598
George, we've been
all through that.

12:51.736 --> 12:54.566
Now stop it.
I'm only going
for a weekend.

12:54.704 --> 12:58.467
The weekend? It's gonna
take you at least
a month to unpack!

12:58.605 --> 13:00.055
Well, what are you
complaining about?

13:00.193 --> 13:02.229
I'm the one who's gonna
be roughing it.

13:02.367 --> 13:05.198
The hell you are.
I'm the one that's gotta eat
Florence's cooking.

13:06.855 --> 13:09.478
Well, if you don't like it,
I won't cook.

13:09.616 --> 13:12.792
You hear that, Weezy?
She's gonna starve me
to death.

13:12.930 --> 13:16.347
Florence, you'll make
Mr. Jefferson
three meals a day.

13:16.485 --> 13:18.694
I'd rather starve.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.110
Oh, now, come on, George,
be a good sport.

13:21.248 --> 13:22.802
This is important to me.

13:22.940 --> 13:25.425
All right,
you wanna camp out?

13:25.563 --> 13:27.323
Camp out on the terrace.

13:27.461 --> 13:30.188
George, why are you
being so difficult?

13:30.326 --> 13:32.397
Weezy, now you know
how special weekends
are to us.

13:32.535 --> 13:34.158
We always spend
them together.

13:34.296 --> 13:37.161
Since when?
You work every Saturday.

13:37.299 --> 13:39.404
Yeah, but I'm
always coming home
on Saturday nights.

13:41.648 --> 13:45.307
Yeah, to watch television.
And I just sit there
and read a book.

13:45.445 --> 13:47.343
I know. But I like
having you here.

13:47.965 --> 13:49.173
Why?

13:49.311 --> 13:50.726
Well, I might
want a sandwich.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.939
That's very
touching, George.

13:57.077 --> 13:58.907
Now I have to get
this thing packed.

13:59.045 --> 14:00.736
Will one of you
please give me a hand?

14:03.497 --> 14:04.602
Florence?

14:05.361 --> 14:06.880
Wait a minute.

14:07.018 --> 14:10.159
You want me to put
all of this stuff
in this little bag?

14:10.297 --> 14:12.679
That's like putting
Wilt Chamberlain
in a hatbox.

14:15.647 --> 14:16.786
It'll fit.

14:21.067 --> 14:22.378
Ah, good evening,
Mr. J.

14:22.516 --> 14:24.173
I hope I'm not
disturbing you.

14:24.311 --> 14:25.692
You're here, ain't you?

14:26.935 --> 14:29.661
Mrs. J, I found the canteen
I was telling you about.

14:29.799 --> 14:32.802
Oh, thank you, Mr. Bentley,
but I already have one.

14:32.941 --> 14:34.908
Oh, not like this.
It's filled with wine.

14:35.046 --> 14:37.255
That's an old
Boy Scout trick.

14:37.393 --> 14:41.811
Mr. Bentley,
why would a Boy Scout
carry a canteen full of wine?

14:41.950 --> 14:44.262
In case he runs into
a Girl Scout and...

14:46.609 --> 14:49.923
Well, that's very
thoughtful of you,
but I can't use it.

14:50.061 --> 14:52.443
Oh, well, I'm sure
I can make good use of it.

14:52.581 --> 14:54.859
Mr. J, your wife
is a very lucky person.

14:54.997 --> 14:57.103
What a wonderful chance
to experience nature

14:57.241 --> 14:59.070
and get away
from the pollution.

14:59.208 --> 15:01.176
Don't knock
pollution, Bentley.

15:01.314 --> 15:02.867
Some people think
it's beautiful.

15:03.419 --> 15:04.455
Really? Who?

15:04.593 --> 15:05.905
Us cleaners!

15:06.043 --> 15:07.699
Pollution gets people
dirty, right?

15:07.837 --> 15:10.426
So, what could be
more beautiful to a cleaner
than a dirty person?

15:12.256 --> 15:14.327
Yes, I suppose it is
all point of view.

15:14.465 --> 15:17.468
I mean, to a goat,
a tin can isn't rubbish,
it's dinner.

15:17.606 --> 15:18.572
What?

15:18.710 --> 15:20.609
Did he just
call me a goat?

15:22.749 --> 15:24.889
No, George.

15:25.027 --> 15:26.753
Oh, Mrs. J,
I envy you.

15:26.891 --> 15:29.480
My Uncle Clifford used
to take us camping
every summer.

15:29.618 --> 15:32.586
There was nothing
he didn't know about
the English forest.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.312
Except for the
Hampton Bog.

15:34.450 --> 15:36.659
The Hampton Bog?
What the hell is that?

15:36.797 --> 15:39.041
That's exactly what
Uncle Clifford said
when he fell in.

15:39.179 --> 15:41.664
He fell in?
Did you hear that, Weezy?

15:41.802 --> 15:44.081
I told you
camping was dangerous.
They got quick sand.

15:44.219 --> 15:48.154
They got wild animals,
man-eating plants,
and the bog!

15:48.292 --> 15:49.879
Bentley, would you mind
telling Weezy

15:50.018 --> 15:51.260
how dangerous
camping can be, please?

15:51.398 --> 15:52.779
Oh, not at all.

15:54.608 --> 15:56.472
Well, go ahead
and tell her!

15:56.610 --> 15:58.405
I just did.
Not at all.

15:59.510 --> 16:01.132
No, camping's
the safest thing
in the world.

16:01.270 --> 16:03.963
It's much safer
than standing out
on Third Avenue.

16:04.101 --> 16:07.414
See, George?
I've got nothing
to worry about.

16:07.552 --> 16:10.521
Well, if you're sure
you don't need this,
I'll be running along.

16:10.659 --> 16:12.557
Wait a minute, Bentley.
Camping's gotta
be dangerous.

16:12.695 --> 16:14.939
What about your uncle
falling into the bog?

16:15.077 --> 16:16.976
Oh, you can't go
by Uncle Clifford.

16:17.114 --> 16:19.979
He was always falling,
or tripping, or bumping
into things.

16:20.117 --> 16:22.533
I always thought
it was poor eyesight,
but his wife said

16:22.671 --> 16:24.949
he just didn't
give a damn.

16:25.087 --> 16:27.400
On the other hand,
my Uncle Claude used
to go around...

16:30.368 --> 16:33.854
You know, I wonder if
he had parents or keepers?

16:35.925 --> 16:37.927
Are you sure
we're putting this on right?

16:38.066 --> 16:39.377
I think so.

16:40.861 --> 16:42.863
Wait a minute,
Mrs. Jefferson,
this thing is heavy.

16:44.175 --> 16:46.902
Well, I'm gonna
have to carry it.
Let it go, Florence.

16:47.592 --> 16:48.662
All right.

17:02.538 --> 17:04.023
Well...

17:04.161 --> 17:06.887
I'm gonna have to
wear it a while
and get used to it.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.338
All it takes
is a little technique.

17:09.476 --> 17:11.996
And three pygmies
running behind,
holding it up.

17:15.310 --> 17:16.759
I'll get it.

17:16.897 --> 17:17.967
See how hard
it is, Weezy?

17:18.106 --> 17:19.210
Why don't you
just give up?

17:21.178 --> 17:22.765
Hello, Florence.

17:22.903 --> 17:25.906
Oh, Louise, I was
waiting for your call
about the newsletter.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.839
Oh, are you
taking a trip?

17:27.977 --> 17:30.290
I'm going on an
Indian dig this weekend.

17:30.428 --> 17:32.189
Oh, the whole weekend?

17:32.327 --> 17:34.605
That museum is really
taking up a lot
of your time.

17:34.743 --> 17:38.885
See that? Even your dumb
friend Helen thinks this trip
is a dumb thing to do.

17:39.023 --> 17:41.577
Helen, will you please tell
George it won't kill him

17:41.715 --> 17:43.407
if I go away
for a weekend?

17:43.545 --> 17:45.478
Uh, I think I better
stay out of this.

17:45.616 --> 17:48.412
That's the first smart thing
I ever heard you say.

17:48.550 --> 17:50.966
Come on, Helen,
this is for the museum.

17:51.104 --> 17:54.659
Look, Louise,
I am not taking any
part of this. Okay?

17:54.797 --> 17:59.216
Two smart things in a row.
Somebody call the newspaper.

17:59.354 --> 18:02.633
No, it's not okay.
You're supposed
to be my friend.

18:02.771 --> 18:05.601
This is
between you and George.
That's all I'm saying.

18:05.739 --> 18:09.847
She did it!
Three in a row!
A new Willis record.

18:11.504 --> 18:14.438
Well, I don't care what
anybody says, I'm going.

18:14.576 --> 18:16.060
And if any of you
come to your senses,

18:16.198 --> 18:17.993
I'll be in the kitchen.

18:21.548 --> 18:22.963
Come here, Mrs. Jefferson.

18:25.173 --> 18:26.657
Oh, thank you, Florence.

18:26.795 --> 18:28.245
I can do it myself now.

18:40.049 --> 18:41.396
I think I better
help her.

18:43.191 --> 18:44.882
Louise.

18:45.020 --> 18:48.955
Helen, will you be getting
too involved if you help me
take this off?

18:51.923 --> 18:56.687
Tell me, Louise,
isn't it unusual

18:57.722 --> 19:00.863
for a volunteer worker
to be invited on a dig?

19:01.001 --> 19:05.040
I don't know. Bob just
asked me if I'd like to go,
and I said yes.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.973
Really? Who else is going?

19:07.111 --> 19:09.113
Oh, I guess
only Bob and me.

19:09.251 --> 19:10.287
Does George know that?

19:10.908 --> 19:12.254
No.
No?

19:13.013 --> 19:15.326
Well, it just never came up.

19:15.464 --> 19:18.364
Oh, well, now that sounds
innocent enough.

19:18.502 --> 19:22.230
You and a gorgeous,
unmarried scientist
going off alone,

19:22.368 --> 19:25.302
up to the woods to do
a little digging around.

19:28.995 --> 19:31.273
And just exactly
what does

19:32.654 --> 19:33.862
this mean?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.416
Oh, it's just an old
Indian dance.

19:36.554 --> 19:38.453
It means, put on
your buffalo skin, Mama,

19:38.591 --> 19:40.040
it is hanky-panky time.

19:44.907 --> 19:47.634
Helen, this is me
you're talking about.

19:47.772 --> 19:50.016
And this is me
you're talking to.

19:50.154 --> 19:51.811
Louise, do you know
what you're doing?

19:51.949 --> 19:53.744
Oh, you don't understand.

19:53.882 --> 19:57.437
All right,
explain it to me.

19:57.575 --> 20:01.821
Okay. I like to get
out of the house and work
on different projects.

20:01.959 --> 20:03.478
I understand that.

20:03.616 --> 20:06.101
And I think a woman
can have a male friend.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.723
I understand that.

20:07.861 --> 20:09.760
And I love George.

20:09.898 --> 20:11.417
I'll never understand that.

20:14.109 --> 20:16.801
Oh, come on, Helen,
nothing is gonna happen.

20:16.939 --> 20:19.287
I am happily married,
and I don't fool around.

20:19.425 --> 20:22.600
Neither do I. But I'm
telling you, you can be
alone with a man,

20:22.738 --> 20:24.292
and it can happen.

20:25.810 --> 20:28.606
Maybe he sees
something in you
nobody ever saw before.

20:30.298 --> 20:33.887
Or maybe he's the only man
who laughed because
you're a rotten speller.

20:34.025 --> 20:37.236
Or maybe
he sings an old song
you always loved.

20:37.374 --> 20:41.032
Or he thinks your story
about a toy doll is cute?

20:41.170 --> 20:43.172
Yeah. Something dumb
like that.

20:45.105 --> 20:47.315
But all those
little things add up.

20:47.453 --> 20:50.076
And all of a sudden,
you're feeling warm,

20:50.214 --> 20:54.598
and close, and boom,
Indian love call.

20:56.496 --> 20:58.602
Helen, don't say that!

20:58.740 --> 21:03.538
Look, I love Tom.
But I'm telling you,
I know it can happen!

21:05.643 --> 21:08.784
Helen, what happened?

21:10.234 --> 21:13.375
Well, it was
a long time ago.

21:13.513 --> 21:16.136
Tom and I had been married
for about 10 years.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.241
Remember, I had told you

21:17.379 --> 21:18.346
that I had gone back
to school

21:18.484 --> 21:19.554
to get my
graduate degree?

21:19.692 --> 21:20.796
Yeah.

21:20.934 --> 21:23.730
Well, Tom went out
of town for a week,

21:24.800 --> 21:26.388
and I got a bee sting
on my ankle.

21:26.526 --> 21:28.079
My whole leg swelled up,

21:28.977 --> 21:30.289
and I had to stay at home.

21:31.497 --> 21:33.222
And my professor
came over every day,

21:33.361 --> 21:34.983
just to keep me
up to date.

21:35.501 --> 21:36.605
Uh-oh.

21:37.088 --> 21:38.435
Oh, no, no, no.

21:38.573 --> 21:40.264
It was
completely innocent.

21:41.507 --> 21:44.130
We talked a lot,
and he cooked for me.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.960
I mean, I liked him, Louise,
but that was all.

21:48.341 --> 21:51.586
Then one day he was
helping me to walk.

21:51.724 --> 21:55.003
And he started singing
Blue Moon.

21:55.383 --> 21:56.384
Oh, girl.

21:58.627 --> 22:00.905
You know how I always
love Blue Moon.

22:01.043 --> 22:06.186
Well, anyway,
we walked, and then
I leaned on him.

22:07.567 --> 22:09.362
And then he leaned on me.

22:10.846 --> 22:13.159
Then I leaned
a little harder.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.403
And...

22:16.438 --> 22:17.474
And?

22:18.440 --> 22:19.476
Nothing.

22:21.305 --> 22:22.375
Nothing?

22:22.513 --> 22:24.619
Girl, you can't fly
with a fat foot.

22:25.930 --> 22:28.347
Then you didn't
do anything, you just
thought about it?

22:28.485 --> 22:30.763
Yeah. Just like
Jimmy Carter...

22:39.944 --> 22:43.327
There you see, Helen,
nothing happened with you.

22:43.465 --> 22:45.881
And nothing
will happen with me.

22:46.019 --> 22:48.367
Then you're going?
Yes, I am.

22:49.506 --> 22:53.130
Okay, Louise, but remember,
you can't always count

22:53.268 --> 22:56.098
on getting a bee sting
to save you.

22:56.236 --> 22:59.792
Then again, there's no sense
in taking chances.

22:59.930 --> 23:02.035
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

23:02.173 --> 23:03.968
You're right.

23:04.106 --> 23:08.145
Poor Bob,
he may not be able
to control himself.

23:09.215 --> 23:10.423
That's my Louise.

23:11.976 --> 23:17.154
Helen, if your foot had
been okay, do you think
you and that professor

23:17.292 --> 23:18.673
would have...

23:18.811 --> 23:20.709
Oh, who knows?
I might have graduated
with honors.

23:20.847 --> 23:21.848
Oh!

23:28.061 --> 23:30.581
Well, it's about time.
What you two been gabbing
about in there?

23:30.719 --> 23:34.067
Oh, oh, nothing, George.
Just, um, woman talk.

23:34.205 --> 23:38.865
Yeah, you know, about cooking.
How we shouldn't let
things get overheated.

23:40.349 --> 23:41.696
Bye.

23:42.282 --> 23:43.525
LOUISE: Helen?
Hmm?

23:43.663 --> 23:44.837
Thanks.

23:45.976 --> 23:48.288
Okay, Weezy,
I've been thinking
about this whole thing,

23:48.427 --> 23:49.566
and I made up my mind.

23:49.704 --> 23:51.740
Relax, George,
I decided not to go.

23:51.878 --> 23:54.156
I don't care what
you decided, you ain't
going nowhere.

23:54.294 --> 23:57.470
Yes, George.
And you can just take
back all of that junk.

23:57.608 --> 23:59.576
Yes, George.
And you can take off
that silly looking outfit.

23:59.714 --> 24:01.370
Yes, George.
And you can...

24:01.509 --> 24:03.718
Oh, I love you, George.
Hey, Weezy, will you cut
it out? We're arguing.

24:03.856 --> 24:05.167
Wait a minute.

24:07.169 --> 24:09.378
Blue moon

24:09.517 --> 24:12.174
You saw me
standing alone

24:12.312 --> 24:14.936
Without a dream
in my heart

24:15.868 --> 24:19.285
Without a love
of my own

24:20.735 --> 24:23.047
Blue moon

24:23.185 --> 24:26.844
You knew just
what I was there for

24:26.982 --> 24:28.915
You heard me saying
a prayer for

24:48.107 --> 24:51.938
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
