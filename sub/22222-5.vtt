00:08.342 --> 00:10.594
Crichton:
Check this out.
This memorial rocks.

00:10.678 --> 00:14.466
They designed these goggles so
you can look back into the past
at the old monastery.

00:14.557 --> 00:16.263
Come on. Check it out.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.466
D'Argo:
John, what are you talking
about? There is nothing here.

00:18.561 --> 00:21.018
You have to put the goggles on.
Come on. Take a look.

00:21.105 --> 00:22.606
Put the goggles on.
Do you want me to look?

00:22.690 --> 00:24.772
Yes, through the goggles.

00:28.070 --> 00:29.526
(whispers ):
Oh, my.

00:29.614 --> 00:31.696
Crichton:
Pretty cool, huh?

00:31.782 --> 00:33.113
Incredible.

00:33.201 --> 00:35.283
This sucker is a tear in time.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.870
lt links to the past.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.821
It looks back to the actual
moment when the event occurred.

00:39.916 --> 00:43.204
Now, check it out. This is the
nurses surrendering to
the Venek Horde.

00:43.294 --> 00:45.956
Can they see us?

00:46.047 --> 00:47.628
I hope not.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.798
Keep watching. You'll see the
final attack on the monastery.

00:50.885 --> 00:54.798
This thing flicks back and
forth between the attack
and the truce.

00:54.889 --> 00:58.256
Aeryn:
This recording device is
accurate. I learned about this Jocacean Memorial.

00:58.351 --> 01:01.764
Well, need I say more?
If you learned about it at
military school it's certain to be farca.

01:01.854 --> 01:06.848
Five hundred cycles ago, 30
Peacekeepers lost their lives
defending this monastery

01:06.943 --> 01:10.231
and Subofficer Dacon is one
of our greatest heroes.

01:10.321 --> 01:12.277
Propaganda for morons.
-I don't believe...

01:12.365 --> 01:15.323
Ah, ladies.
Some decorum, please.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.945
This is a peace memorial.

01:17.036 --> 01:19.527
Let's not kill one another.

01:19.622 --> 01:21.112
You're wrong, you know.
-Bullfrell.

01:21.207 --> 01:22.822
You're wrong.
-Bullfrell.

01:22.917 --> 01:25.283
You're wrong. If you'd only...
Subofficer Dacon stood
right up there.

01:25.378 --> 01:26.618
The device says right up there.

01:26.712 --> 01:28.703
Guts pouring out everywhere,
bleeding,

01:28.798 --> 01:31.130
and yet he still managed to
initiate the peace process
to save the nurses.

01:31.217 --> 01:35.335
Bullfrell!
Peacekeepers have always been a
manifest military contagion that has raped and pillaged.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.260
They never died for any nurses.

01:37.348 --> 01:40.590
That's just a silly little
story to help naive children
sleep at night.

01:40.685 --> 01:42.471
Do you know what would help
me sleep better at night?

01:42.561 --> 01:44.142
Do you want to hear?
-Stop it, girls, stop that.

01:44.230 --> 01:45.140
I'm going to get this thing
and stuff it so far...

01:45.231 --> 01:48.439
D'Argo:
Stop it, okay? Stop.

01:48.818 --> 01:50.683
Good.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.860
Rygel. Can we get out
of here yet?

01:52.947 --> 01:55.313
Chiana:
D'Argo, it's Chi.

01:55.408 --> 01:57.239
No, no, no.
We, we can't leave yet.

01:57.326 --> 01:59.487
Pilot still needs another am
to fix condensers.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.079
I'll let you know
when he's done.

What are you doing in
Zhaan's quarters?

02:06.877 --> 02:08.287
You know why I'm here.

02:08.379 --> 02:10.620
Same reason as you.

02:10.715 --> 02:12.000
And why am I here?

02:12.091 --> 02:15.424
(giggling )1
To steal whatever's left.

02:17.179 --> 02:19.465
Yeah, that's right.

02:19.557 --> 02:21.798
Well, we're sensible,
you and me.

02:21.892 --> 02:25.134
Leaving this to rot won't
bring Zhaan back.

02:27.315 --> 02:28.976
No.

02:30.609 --> 02:33.225
You can have whatever you find.

02:35.281 --> 02:36.942
I don't want it.

02:38.117 --> 02:40.028
No.

02:40.119 --> 02:41.984
Neither do |.

02:44.582 --> 02:45.822
( rock crashes )

02:45.916 --> 02:48.623
Stark, let me show you
something.

02:48.711 --> 02:51.623
Zhaan bought these.
Bought them for me.

02:51.714 --> 02:55.127
I know. And you look great.
You look like Astro Boy.
Come on. Let me show you.

02:57.762 --> 02:59.969
It's gone now.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.385
Come with me.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.140
Come on.

03:08.230 --> 03:12.690
With these, you can see 500
cycles into the past,
as it's happening,

03:12.777 --> 03:16.645
back to the moment when the
nurses here were saved.

03:16.739 --> 03:19.105
Ah, I don't want to, no, no.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.406
No, it's okay.

03:20.493 --> 03:22.484
It's a moment of peace.

03:22.578 --> 03:25.365
It's the very thing Zhaan
treasured most.

03:30.503 --> 03:32.539
Can you see it?

03:32.630 --> 03:35.463
I can see...

03:35.549 --> 03:39.133
I can see so much.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.711
So much death!

03:41.806 --> 03:43.967
(moaning)

03:45.476 --> 03:47.182
( Stark screams )
D'Argo:
Get that mask off of him.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.884
What are you doing to him?
-Stark?

03:48.979 --> 03:50.640
( screaming )

03:51.816 --> 03:53.352
Crichton:
I can't see.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.019
I can't see.

03:55.111 --> 03:56.317
Stark, are you all right?

03:56.404 --> 03:57.359
Stark?

04:00.866 --> 04:02.322
He's breathing.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.820
What happened?

04:03.911 --> 04:05.276
Oh...

04:07.248 --> 04:08.328
Where the frell are we?

04:08.416 --> 04:10.281
The old monastery.

04:10.376 --> 04:12.788
But how can that be?
We're not wearing the goggles.

04:13.629 --> 04:15.995
This is outstanding.

04:16.090 --> 04:18.923
This is the finest simulation
I've ever seen.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.751
It's so real. It's so...

04:21.846 --> 04:23.461
Incoming.

04:23.556 --> 04:25.296
Get down!

04:25.391 --> 04:26.631
Get down.

04:28.519 --> 04:29.975
(yells)

04:30.062 --> 04:31.893
Crichton:
D'Argo, Jool's hit.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.142
Jool!

04:34.233 --> 04:35.518
( screams )

04:35.609 --> 04:36.815
Jool!

04:43.909 --> 04:46.286
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

04:46.370 --> 04:50.113
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

04:50.207 --> 04:51.788
I'm trying to stay alive...

04:51.876 --> 04:53.787
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

04:53.878 --> 04:56.585
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.128
If you can hear me...
Beware.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.206
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

05:00.301 --> 05:03.259
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

05:03.345 --> 05:07.554
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless, for the nightmares
I've seen.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.973
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

05:10.060 --> 05:12.517
Not show them...
You exist...

05:12.605 --> 05:16.314
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

05:50.309 --> 05:52.049
Right, move now! Come on, in!

05:52.144 --> 05:54.521
Don't touch me! My arm!
-If you don't move, you'll die.
-Move it! Move it!

05:54.605 --> 05:57.813
Jool:
Oh, I thought we were in
a peace memorial.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.391
I got shot at a peace memorial.

06:00.486 --> 06:01.817
Shut up.

06:01.904 --> 06:04.896
What are you doing?
( screams )

06:04.990 --> 06:06.321
Stop screaming.

06:08.994 --> 06:10.279
Nice hit.

06:10.371 --> 06:12.612
All right, no weapons.
Let's figure out what's
going on here.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.197
Aeryn:
I know exactly what's going on.
Someone is trying to kill us.

06:15.292 --> 06:18.204
You know, Aeryn, I think
Stark's mask might have pulled
us sometime into the past.

06:18.295 --> 06:19.705
I kind of figured that one out.

06:19.797 --> 06:22.209
John's right. If we change
anything here, change the past,

06:22.299 --> 06:24.631
the future might not happen
as it's meant to.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.219
Then we won't get back.
-So, we don't get back.

06:26.303 --> 06:29.386
But I'm not dying just so that
things don't change.
-Don't move.

06:29.473 --> 06:32.510
Whoa, whoa, no weapons.
No, don't shoot. Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

06:32.601 --> 06:33.807
Reinforcements.

06:33.894 --> 06:34.974
You received our distress call?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.472
Yes, we did.
Are you Subofficer Dacon?

06:36.564 --> 06:37.929
No, Commanding Officer Tarn.

06:38.023 --> 06:41.356
Officer Sun, Subofficer
Crichton Luxan is a mercenary.

06:41.443 --> 06:42.148
How did you get inside?

06:42.236 --> 06:43.851
We rappelled down the
cliff face.

06:43.946 --> 06:45.152
Only five of us made it
but the Banik...

06:45.239 --> 06:47.821
Five? But we asked for
hundreds of soldiers.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.773
The Veneks, there are
thousands in the valley.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.029
Dacon, shut up, and get
back up on the wall.

06:52.121 --> 06:53.076
Yes, sir.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.074
That is Subofficer Dacon?

06:55.165 --> 06:56.245
Tarn:
Nurse!

06:56.333 --> 06:57.448
Any more reinforcements
on the cliff?

06:57.543 --> 06:59.033
5.13.35
5&2“: ;

06:59.128 --> 07:00.208
Maybe.

07:00.296 --> 07:02.332
All right. Now they're jamming
all pulse weapons

07:02.423 --> 07:05.290
so grab a spear and keep the
bastards from getting in.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.879
(moans and groans)

07:10.931 --> 07:11.886
Ha!

07:13.976 --> 07:15.682
Crichton:
Hey, try not to kill anybody.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.225
I'm not going to kill anyone.

07:17.313 --> 07:19.178
Oh, I might kill this guy.

07:23.527 --> 07:24.937
Dacon!

07:30.326 --> 07:32.362
Oops, sorry. Don't die.
Don't die.

07:44.256 --> 07:45.041
(grunting)

07:45.132 --> 07:46.668
Dacon:
Officer Tarn!

07:50.387 --> 07:52.548
What's the matter, Pilot?
Why'd you comm?

07:52.640 --> 07:54.346
Have you heard from Crichton
at the memorial?

07:54.433 --> 07:56.264
Yeah, D'Argo commed about
an arn ago.

07:56.352 --> 07:59.219
He said Jool and Aeryn were
tralk fighting.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.178
That seemed normal.

08:01.273 --> 08:02.683
Why? What's the matter?

08:02.775 --> 08:04.891
Nothing. Just, when we arrived

08:04.985 --> 08:08.728
the automated orbit instructions
were broadcast in Jocacean.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.028
Yeah, well it's a memorial.

08:10.115 --> 08:12.857
But now, Moya received
a request to lift orbit.

08:12.951 --> 08:17.285
This time, the broadcast was
in basic Venek vernacular.

08:17.373 --> 08:20.410
Yeah, but didn't the Veneks
abandon the planet like
400 cycles ago?

08:20.501 --> 08:21.832
That's what I thought.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.159
Well, comm Crichton and D'Argo.

08:23.253 --> 08:26.211
I'll poke around in some
frequencies and see what
I can find.

08:26.298 --> 08:28.835
Woman (whispers):
Do you all know the sacrifice
you have made?

08:28.926 --> 08:30.962
Crichton:
So, what does that
recording device say? Did we miss anything?

08:31.053 --> 08:33.294
Aeryn:
I don't know. It says here
that the Veneks attacked

08:33.389 --> 08:35.471
and all but one of the
Peacekeepers were killed.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.263
And that happened.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.842
The boy you saved.
Was he supposed to die?

08:39.937 --> 08:42.428
Dacon? No, he dies when he
gets up there near dawn

08:42.523 --> 08:45.936
and sends back the ceasefire
initiative to the Veneks.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.358
So Dacon's supposed to be
some kind of hero?

08:50.114 --> 08:53.197
Anyway, according to this the
leader of the Venek Corps,
General Grynes,

08:53.283 --> 08:55.148
has just witnessed how this
battle went,

08:55.244 --> 08:57.781
ascertained that there are only
women and children remaining,

08:57.871 --> 09:01.284
and is out there now convincing
the other generals to offer
a ceasefire.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.582
So, it's possible the time tear
is still around here.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.000
We find it and let's get out.

09:05.087 --> 09:07.169
I'll get Jool and Stark
and find the tear.

09:07.256 --> 09:10.339
Don't frell things up
when I'm gone.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.167
You know, if we did
change things,

09:13.262 --> 09:16.004
it is possible that we could
improve the future.

09:16.098 --> 09:19.261
With our record, you think
that's gonna happen?

09:20.686 --> 09:22.301
I guess not.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.886
I discovered something,
by the way.

09:23.981 --> 09:26.814
I don't know about yours but my
pulse pistol is operational.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.391
(beeping)
Yeah, mine, too.

09:29.486 --> 09:33.195
Their plasma frequencies must
only work against primitive
recharges.

09:33.282 --> 09:35.113
What about D'Argo's
Qualta rifle?

09:35.200 --> 09:38.408
It's as old as most of
the weapons around here.
I doubt it'll fire.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.952
This one's still alive.
Can you help me get him
to the locker room?

09:41.039 --> 09:42.370
Yeah, no problem, Opie.

09:42.458 --> 09:45.450
I just hope this was
supposed to happen.

09:45.544 --> 09:48.035
So, you guys got any beer
around here?

09:48.130 --> 09:50.291
Beer, it's like fellip nectar.

09:50.382 --> 09:53.419
Fellip's a creature
on Tarsis 6.

09:55.554 --> 09:58.011
(panting)

10:01.769 --> 10:03.134
That hurts.

10:03.228 --> 10:04.968
Is that sterile?

10:05.063 --> 10:07.315
Oh, God, I'll probably
get hekpus.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.014
Here, drink this.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.019
Why?

10:10.110 --> 10:10.895
It will dull the pain.

10:10.986 --> 10:12.487
Oh, thank Blasma.

10:12.571 --> 10:15.654
(gurgling)

10:15.741 --> 10:18.858
At least maybe now,
I might die of shock.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.240
That bitch just shoved the
arrow right through. She...

10:22.956 --> 10:25.242
Oh, hello.

10:25.334 --> 10:26.744
Hesca.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.666
Do you feel this?

10:28.754 --> 10:29.664
Nothing.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.666
(gasps )
Look!

10:31.757 --> 10:34.123
This is great! I've got to get
some of this to bring home.
What is it?

10:34.218 --> 10:37.210
One part water, nine parts
fellip urine.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.838
(gagging )

10:40.933 --> 10:42.139
You made me drink piss?

10:42.226 --> 10:43.762
D'Argo:
Okay. Okay, Jool.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.309
Let's get out of here,
away from the children.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.391
You can come with me, too.

10:51.109 --> 10:54.317
Dacon:
In here, it's about all
this thing's good for.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.646
Oh, basha, my frelling...

10:57.741 --> 11:00.357
Sorry for cursing.
-No, you okay?

11:02.996 --> 11:05.248
Dacon, have you been
a soldier long?

11:05.332 --> 11:06.833
Were you talking to
Officer Tarn?

11:06.917 --> 11:11.752
No, it's just that I once heard
you killed a dozen Veneks

11:11.839 --> 11:14.125
when they breached the
stak wall.

11:14.216 --> 11:16.332
Me?
-Mmm.

11:17.427 --> 11:20.339
Did you not also save
the nurses' convoy?

11:20.430 --> 11:23.217
No, Officer Tarn did all that.

11:23.308 --> 11:26.266
He was a very noble man.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.344
He always gave credit away.

11:28.856 --> 11:29.766
He, uh...

11:29.857 --> 11:31.813
Get down!

11:31.900 --> 11:33.060
This...

11:35.070 --> 11:36.606
Their snipers might see it.

11:37.656 --> 11:39.442
Who am I kidding?

11:39.533 --> 11:42.115
I'm not a soldier.

11:42.202 --> 11:45.365
I was attached to this unit
as Comm Supervisor,

11:45.455 --> 11:47.491
and Sustenance Preparer.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.198
You were the cook?

11:49.293 --> 11:50.373
Yeah.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.961
And with everyone
getting killed,

11:52.045 --> 11:54.832
I was terrified l was gonna
be ranking officer.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.299
I'm so glad you turned up.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.544
Um... no, uh...

11:58.635 --> 12:01.297
Dacon, you know the engagement
better than I do.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.673
You have to be the...

12:02.764 --> 12:04.265
I'm a cook.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.806
You gotta take over.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.016
You're General Grynes, right?

12:16.111 --> 12:19.228
Believe it or not, you don't
all look alike to us.

12:20.032 --> 12:22.318
You're a man of compassion.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.865
Aren't you?

12:23.952 --> 12:25.613
At the Battle of Madazac,

12:25.704 --> 12:28.320
you offered a truce when you
could have forced victory.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.951
How do you know that?

12:30.042 --> 12:31.532
Read about you.

12:31.627 --> 12:33.288
Studied you.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.755
At, uh, school.

12:37.758 --> 12:38.998
Can you see the tear?

12:39.092 --> 12:40.957
Moving, moving...

12:41.762 --> 12:44.720
No, above us... above us.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.637
I can see it, too, look.
It's yellow and...

12:46.725 --> 12:48.056
Shut up, Jool. Where is it?

12:48.143 --> 12:50.384
It's coming...
it's coming down.

12:50.479 --> 12:51.935
It's coming down. It's here.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.262
Now.
-Okay.

12:53.357 --> 12:54.563
You go through it.
I'll go get the others.

12:54.650 --> 12:56.265
I'm not going.

12:56.735 --> 12:58.225
( groans )

13:00.322 --> 13:01.937
Well, that was obviously wrong.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.068
What are you doing?
There is nothing there.

13:04.159 --> 13:05.615
Now, tell me,
where is it exactly?

13:05.702 --> 13:06.487
It's here, here.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.694
Okay.
( screaming )

13:13.335 --> 13:14.666
Mud!

13:14.753 --> 13:16.584
You threw me in mud.
-|'|| go get Crichton and Aeryn.

13:16.672 --> 13:18.583
I'll be 30 microts.
Can you hold?

13:18.674 --> 13:19.914
Yes, yes.

13:20.008 --> 13:20.963
Bastards.

13:21.051 --> 13:23.133
They shot me, they punch me,

13:23.220 --> 13:25.176
they made me drink piss.

13:26.348 --> 13:28.213
(gasping)

13:28.976 --> 13:31.388
Oh, my Blasma.

13:31.687 --> 13:32.847
Stark!

13:32.938 --> 13:35.350
It's not the same here!

13:35.440 --> 13:38.307
It's not the same here, Stark.

13:38.402 --> 13:39.562
(Jool screaming)

13:39.653 --> 13:41.314
That's the lie.

13:41.405 --> 13:43.145
It's the lie.
It's what's wrong.

13:43.240 --> 13:46.858
( screams )
-Millions, billions, dead.

13:46.952 --> 13:49.193
(moans)

13:51.289 --> 13:53.450
(yells)

13:58.880 --> 14:00.131
Okay, now focus Stykeran.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.251
Where is the tear?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.003
Ah...
-Uh-uh-uh-uh.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.918
Specifically.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.879
Find it yourself.
You find it yourself.

14:08.974 --> 14:11.590
You will listen to me!

14:11.685 --> 14:13.175
Tell me where the tear is,

14:13.270 --> 14:16.103
or I will use your face
to create a new one.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.054
Stark, what's the problem?

14:18.150 --> 14:20.687
Jool went through, then we
go through, and everything's
made right again.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.268
Oh, that's the lie. That's
the lie. That's what wrong.
That's the lie.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.945
Oh great. Yeah, we have to put
up with this dren again.

14:26.033 --> 14:30.447
Oh, when the foul woman
pierced the membrane back
to our time, death.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.073
Jool's dead?

14:32.164 --> 14:33.279
Others.

14:33.373 --> 14:37.116
Thousands. Millions. Billions.
Trillions.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.326
Yes, yes, all right. Very many.
We get the idea.

14:39.421 --> 14:41.036
Not when we came through.

14:41.131 --> 14:43.372
The people you're sensing
weren't dead before?

14:44.885 --> 14:48.628
Oh, yeah. We did it being here.
We changed the future.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.178
We don't know that, John.

14:50.265 --> 14:51.129
Well, look at him. He knows it.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.476
Can't we just go through
and sort this out later?

14:53.560 --> 14:54.845
We must do it here now.

14:54.936 --> 14:57.473
As Zhaan always says,
"Do right by the wrong.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.475
Goddess helps us all along."

14:59.566 --> 15:01.147
Feeling left out, D'Argo?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.974
We're the only ones who don't
have voices in our heads.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.982
Well what are we gonna do
if someone wants to know
where Jool is?

15:06.073 --> 15:09.190
Oh look, do you think anyone
here cares about Jool?

15:09.284 --> 15:11.240
Just tell them that she's dead.

15:11.328 --> 15:13.193
Fine.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.199
Stick with Stark.
I've got an idea.

15:15.290 --> 15:18.407
It'll set the timeline right
and get us a ceasefire.

15:18.502 --> 15:20.117
Won't work.
-Yes, it will.

15:20.212 --> 15:21.497
No, it won't.
-You don't even know
what it is.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.919
Yes, I do.
-No, you don't.

15:23.006 --> 15:24.291
Oh yes, I do.
-Oh, and what is your plan?

15:24.382 --> 15:26.338
You're... you're gonna
use pulse pistols?

15:26.426 --> 15:27.461
Kill all the Veneks you can?

15:27.552 --> 15:29.258
Actually, yes.

15:29.346 --> 15:32.338
When they attack again, I'll
show you my way to get
a ceasefire.

15:34.351 --> 15:37.343
God.

15:37.437 --> 15:41.180
You are gonna have to stay out
of this room if you can't
stop shedding.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.686
Without renewal,
there's stagnation.

15:43.777 --> 15:44.732
Yeah?

15:44.820 --> 15:46.560
Well, I feel the same
way about men.

15:46.655 --> 15:48.270
But I don't leave them
lying around.

15:48.365 --> 15:50.196
Can't you ever play nice?

15:50.283 --> 15:52.774
I got shot with a hekpus
infected arrow, you
monochromatic little bitch.

15:52.869 --> 15:57.659
Pilot:
Chiana, I believe Jool may not
have overstated the situation,

15:57.749 --> 16:00.536
much to my surprise.

16:00.627 --> 16:04.336
These broadcast frequencies are
static. What happened to them?

16:04.422 --> 16:05.707
Well, I kept trying
to tell you.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.336
Apparently, devastated
by conflict.

16:08.426 --> 16:13.341
The planet is still inhabited,
but by a bare fraction
of the population

16:13.431 --> 16:15.296
from just a few arns ago.

16:15.392 --> 16:18.350
If you don't like me, fine.
But don't treat me like
I'm nonexistent.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.222
Somehow we went back in time
and the others are still there.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.178
And if you knew anything
about linear continuity,

16:22.274 --> 16:25.562
you'd realize what they're doing
back there now is affecting
things on that planet.

16:25.652 --> 16:29.361
What minimal data stores
I can access

16:29.447 --> 16:34.658
indicate a vicious war claimed
millions of lives around
500 cycles ago.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.617
But that's not what happened
when we got here.

16:40.584 --> 16:42.324
They made peace.

16:48.258 --> 16:51.250
Dacon. Slowly take your
finger off the trigger

16:51.344 --> 16:55.053
and point the weapon away
from both of us.

16:57.851 --> 17:01.093
Those recruitment holochips
never said anything about this.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.519
About what?

17:02.606 --> 17:04.938
Fighting with primitive weapons?

17:05.025 --> 17:06.435
Dying.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.437
Knowing you're gonna die.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.235
Having time to think about it.

17:11.323 --> 17:13.735
Well as a soldier you
don't think about it.

17:13.825 --> 17:17.363
I'm a cook. I like to
think about food.

17:20.916 --> 17:23.157
Why did you join up?

17:24.419 --> 17:26.330
I didn't.

17:26.421 --> 17:28.286
You were born into service.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.168
Aboard a Command Carrier.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.920
No wonder you're fearless.

17:33.011 --> 17:37.254
No. It's easy to be
fearless around here.

17:37.349 --> 17:39.715
This is what Peacekeepers
are meant to do.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.095
Help the defenseless.

17:42.187 --> 17:43.927
You'll be fine.

17:49.069 --> 17:53.438
Crichton:
Why is this cloister
so important?

17:53.531 --> 17:57.274
Your superiors sent you into
battle without an understanding
of the antecedents?

17:57.369 --> 17:59.200
You really are barbarians.

17:59.287 --> 18:03.246
No, we're Peacekeepers.
Barbarians butcher children.

18:05.126 --> 18:10.337
Yes, the Horde is bloodthirsty,
and almost impossible
to control.

18:12.676 --> 18:18.797
I'm trying not to be a
barbarian, and I've never
harmed a child in my life.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.261
Why is your army here?

18:27.524 --> 18:32.735
My soldiers used to share the
waters of the Krytlin River
with the cities on the plateau.

18:34.030 --> 18:39.616
Now our supply has dried
and we're dying.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.989
So this is about water?

18:42.080 --> 18:44.913
Inside this mountain is the
source of the river.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.915
If we don't gain access to it,
the Horde will attack the cities

18:50.005 --> 18:52.212
and millions will die.

18:53.008 --> 18:55.545
But you,

18:55.635 --> 18:58.251
you want to offer a ceasefire.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.431
How do you know this?

19:00.515 --> 19:02.346
Doesn't matter.
We accept your offer.

19:02.434 --> 19:05.301
But the Horde will not offer it
while opposing soldiers
are still here.

19:05.395 --> 19:09.809
We won't be here.
By the time you and your
soldiers arrive, we'll be gone.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.514
And why would you do this?

19:11.609 --> 19:14.191
Same reason you'll
offer amnesty.

19:14.279 --> 19:16.395
We're not barbarians.

19:16.489 --> 19:21.324
You give me your word you won't
harm the women and children,

19:21.411 --> 19:23.777
and I'll get you out of here.

19:26.499 --> 19:30.617
There seems to be too many
nurses here and not
enough fighters.

19:30.712 --> 19:35.547
We were on a healing caravan
when the Horde began the
conflict.

19:35.633 --> 19:38.625
This detachment of
Peacekeepers found us.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.881
We're just here for
our protection.

19:40.972 --> 19:44.009
Are the Peacekeepers contracted
to defend your world?

19:45.393 --> 19:49.227
They uphold all that's good.

19:49.314 --> 19:51.930
It's ironic. We might have been
safer if they'd never found us.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.561
( chuckles wryly )

19:54.819 --> 19:58.732
Do you know what the Horde
does to children?

20:01.493 --> 20:11.038
If they overrun us, and I'm
too weak, or unable,

20:11.127 --> 20:15.166
I'd rather my girl were at
peace than in their hands.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.380
Please?

20:18.968 --> 20:21.425
I'll depend on you.

20:36.820 --> 20:39.562
Why were you crying?

20:39.656 --> 20:42.272
Because of all the pain.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.449
What's your name?

20:45.537 --> 20:48.279
Cyntrina.

20:48.373 --> 20:52.412
My father's dead, and
I never cried.

21:23.450 --> 21:24.940
This is humiliating.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.410
Yeah, bonnets are
always a risk,

21:26.494 --> 21:29.281
but it's the little touches
that put you over the wall.

21:32.876 --> 21:34.992
I'm not gonna get screwed
here, am I?

21:35.086 --> 21:37.122
Just don't be here
when we arrive.

21:37.213 --> 21:39.249
All of your soldiers
must be gone.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.672
That's the plan.

21:41.759 --> 21:43.135
The ground looks soft
on the other side.

21:43.219 --> 21:47.713
All you got to do is drop down,
hit the embankment and roll.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.217
Thank you.

21:49.309 --> 21:50.890
Yeah.

21:54.772 --> 21:56.353
Hey, General?

21:57.567 --> 21:59.432
I've got a good feeling
about this.

21:59.527 --> 22:03.145
I think history is going to
remember you as the maker
of great peace.

22:04.115 --> 22:06.527
(screaming)
-No. No!

22:07.202 --> 22:08.112
No, no, no, no.

22:08.203 --> 22:09.739
Stand fast, traitor!

22:09.829 --> 22:12.866
No, no, no, no!
You did notjust do that!

22:12.957 --> 22:17.200
You did not! Please tell me
you did notjust do that!

22:19.047 --> 22:21.208
I ask again, are you part
of his deception?

22:21.299 --> 22:23.335
No, Crichton's actions
are his alone.

22:23.426 --> 22:24.461
He told us nothing.

22:24.552 --> 22:27.043
Hey, folks. I'm not the
enemy here.

22:27.138 --> 22:28.423
We should kill him.

22:28.515 --> 22:29.721
No! Too much killing.

22:29.807 --> 22:31.638
No more killing. Stop the
killing. Stop.

22:31.726 --> 22:34.718
It's worse, not better.
It's more dead.

22:34.812 --> 22:36.598
What's he talking about?

22:36.689 --> 22:39.180
Ah, nothing. Just what will
happen to us if we don't pull
ourselves together.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.482
Crichton:
That guy you shot?
He was their general.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.776
He wanted to offer you
a ceasefire.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.194
I don't believe you.

22:45.281 --> 22:46.896
Aeryn:
Why didn't you tell us
anything?

22:46.991 --> 22:48.731
There wasn't time.
-Oh, like frell there wasn't.

22:48.826 --> 22:50.782
And since when do you make
decisions for me?

22:50.870 --> 22:54.158
Aeryn, we get him back to his
lines and this war's over.
You know that.

22:54.249 --> 22:55.659
Liar, he's a liar.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.160
No!

22:57.252 --> 22:59.834
Don't kill anyone else, Mother.

23:07.303 --> 23:10.261
Crichton:
The Venek leaders want
to offer you peace.

23:10.348 --> 23:14.432
They're desperate for an excuse
to offer you peace.

23:14.519 --> 23:18.011
Give them a sign and I promise,
they won't hurt you.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.019
( shouts )

23:31.286 --> 23:37.202
Jocacean civilians and
Peacekeeper Militia, hear me.

23:37.292 --> 23:41.410
You will never know how close
to salvation you came,

23:41.504 --> 23:45.793
how near lasting peace
you brushed.

23:45.883 --> 23:51.219
The death of our general
in battle we understand
and accept.

23:51.306 --> 23:55.675
But to disgrace him in
your females' cloth?

23:55.768 --> 24:00.762
You have the night's stars to
make peace with your deities.

24:00.857 --> 24:07.069
On the dawn, your severed heads
will be nailed to the walls
you defend.

24:26.007 --> 24:32.549
( harmonica playing
"Home on the Range")

25:17.475 --> 25:21.218
Ah, John.

25:21.312 --> 25:24.224
If this situation hadn't
reminded you of all those
old Westerns

25:24.315 --> 25:27.648
you watched as a youth, I never
would have heard that.

25:27.735 --> 25:30.112
Are you through?

25:30.530 --> 25:32.361
Quite.

25:32.949 --> 25:34.564
The interlude, however,

25:34.659 --> 25:39.119
allowed me to ponder the
question you ah, summoned
me here to answer.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.161
And?

25:41.249 --> 25:45.288
All modern research points to
the elasticity of time

25:45.378 --> 25:47.289
rather than a brittle framework.

25:47.380 --> 25:48.961
Can it be corrected?

25:49.048 --> 25:50.128
Hmm.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.047
If nudged closely enough
to course,

25:52.135 --> 25:54.467
events have a way of
restructuring themselves.

25:54.554 --> 25:58.138
If the participants are the
same, the venues the same,

25:58.224 --> 26:03.264
the motivation's the same, then
well, the outcome is likely
to be the same.

26:03.354 --> 26:06.391
So we have to find a way to
kick start this thing.

26:07.316 --> 26:10.228
And soon.

26:10.319 --> 26:15.188
When the Horde attacks at dawn,
events will vector further away

26:15.283 --> 26:17.990
from the reality you
and I both know.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.361
Suggestions?

26:22.081 --> 26:23.742
No.

26:23.833 --> 26:26.540
Not this time, John.

26:26.627 --> 26:31.166
There's been so much change.
What with you here,
Grynes dead.

26:31.257 --> 26:35.421
I don't want the consequences
of catastrophic failure
resting on my head.

26:36.387 --> 26:39.299
I'm in a hell of a slump here,

26:39.390 --> 26:42.223
and everything I do just
makes things worse.

26:42.310 --> 26:43.846
Well, then...

26:43.936 --> 26:45.437
do better.

26:45.521 --> 26:49.480
( harmonica playing
"Home on the Range")

26:58.367 --> 27:03.361
We can record a message over
the one sent by Colonel Lennok.

27:03.456 --> 27:07.665
And I have convinced Dacon into
offering a complete and
total surrender.

27:07.752 --> 27:09.743
It's the only way to
save the nurses.

27:09.837 --> 27:13.500
Maybe. You wanna better
the odds?
-How?

27:13.591 --> 27:16.207
Scroll through that
digi-pamphlet you got at
the Peace Memorial.

27:16.302 --> 27:19.294
Look for anything that may be
out of sync that we can fix.

27:19.388 --> 27:20.298
What?

27:20.389 --> 27:21.674
Oh what, you think I'm...
I'm stupid?

27:21.766 --> 27:24.303
That I don't understand
what you're saying?

27:24.393 --> 27:26.224
Subofficer Dacon does not
have to die.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.268
He's Davy Crockett
at the Alamo.

27:28.356 --> 27:30.312
He stands on the wall and
takes one for the home team.

27:30.399 --> 27:33.891
I've thought about this.
It's the only thing that I
can come up with to fix the timeline.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.772
Oh, you and your
stupid timeline.

27:35.863 --> 27:37.273
What, you think I wanna do it?

27:37.365 --> 27:38.901
You think it's my first option?

27:38.991 --> 27:40.777
Read the history.
It's in your pocket.

27:40.868 --> 27:43.405
If Grynes lives, he's a hero
who averts a war.

27:43.496 --> 27:46.909
Dead, he's just another guy in
the Laura Ashley Spring
Collection.

27:48.376 --> 27:49.741
It's you and me now.

27:49.836 --> 27:52.703
We've gotta do something.

27:52.797 --> 27:54.287
He's not a soldier.

27:54.382 --> 27:56.168
I know that.

27:56.259 --> 28:01.219
But the way history unfolds
that doesn't stop him from
taking an arrow.

28:05.059 --> 28:06.890
So...

28:06.978 --> 28:09.264
Dacon dies.

28:09.355 --> 28:10.891
What about us? We're soldiers.

28:10.982 --> 28:13.439
We go back through
the time tear.
-The tear?

28:13.526 --> 28:16.563
Stark says it's completely
disappeared. What happens
if it doesn't reshow?

28:16.654 --> 28:20.317
Then we die half an am
after Dacon.

28:20.408 --> 28:23.491
Aeryn, either way he dies.

28:27.290 --> 28:29.246
And the nurses.

28:29.333 --> 28:32.245
That's what we have to
play for now.

28:53.107 --> 28:54.643
You deal with the dead?

28:54.734 --> 28:56.474
Someone must.

28:56.569 --> 28:59.481
Death is where my
expertise ends.

29:02.366 --> 29:06.279
When you shot the General
how did you feel?

29:07.288 --> 29:11.031
I felt hatred. Fear.

29:11.125 --> 29:12.535
Fear is good.

29:12.627 --> 29:14.333
Keep that.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.287
But travel light. Forget hate.

29:19.216 --> 29:26.338
If we die, will I be
with my daughter?

29:26.432 --> 29:28.297
After?

29:29.644 --> 29:33.637
Different beliefs,
different destinations.

29:33.731 --> 29:36.393
I cannot tell before the end.

29:38.444 --> 29:42.778
Should the worst befall,
you will not be alone.

30:02.218 --> 30:03.628
Hello.

30:04.845 --> 30:06.585
You're scary looking.

30:06.681 --> 30:09.138
You should have seen my father.

30:09.225 --> 30:11.261
My father wasn't scary.

30:11.352 --> 30:16.892
My mother says, when loved
ones die, we must remember
them forever.

30:18.359 --> 30:20.224
Well, your mother is right.

30:22.363 --> 30:26.276
Do you think when I'm dead,
someone will remember me?

30:29.495 --> 30:32.077
You know what?

30:32.164 --> 30:37.329
I know a secret that
will guarantee it.

30:39.797 --> 30:41.333
Make your mark.

30:42.883 --> 30:44.839
Carve it into the stone.

30:46.470 --> 30:52.181
That way in the future, anyone
that reads it will think
of Cyntrina.

31:08.451 --> 31:11.534
I've offered unconditional
surrender, just like
you said to.

31:11.620 --> 31:16.205
And I've also sworn that
killing their general was
a tragic mistake.

31:16.292 --> 31:20.035
But as Ranking Officer, are you
sure you shouldn't be the one
on the message?

31:20.129 --> 31:23.292
As a part of Special Commando
Force, I'm not officially here.

31:23.382 --> 31:26.670
So if they knew your unit was
present it would escalate
the conflict?

31:26.761 --> 31:27.796
Mm-hmm.

31:27.887 --> 31:28.876
What are you doing?

31:28.971 --> 31:31.428
I... I'm delivering
the message.

31:31.515 --> 31:32.891
There? You should shoot
from down here.

31:32.975 --> 31:34.556
Ah, no, we only get one chance.

31:34.643 --> 31:37.055
I can't have it go wrong and
it needs to land right near
their camps.

31:37.146 --> 31:39.353
You can't expose yourself to
their fire. Let me do it.

31:39.440 --> 31:42.182
I appreciate the gesture,
but a soldier should do it.

31:42.276 --> 31:43.436
Better if a cook does it.

31:43.527 --> 31:45.233
Aeryn:
I don't want you to get hurt.

31:45.321 --> 31:46.982
Better me than you.

32:20.731 --> 32:22.471
(sighs)

32:24.568 --> 32:26.854
Subofficer Dacon?

32:29.365 --> 32:31.447
You are a soldier.

32:32.785 --> 32:34.776
A brave hero.

32:35.704 --> 32:38.411
No. Heroes always get killed.

32:40.835 --> 32:42.621
I'll be fine.

33:01.105 --> 33:02.515
(girl screams)

33:11.115 --> 33:14.323
How is that possible?
How is that possible?

33:14.410 --> 33:16.275
Pilot:
I don't know, Chiana.

33:16.370 --> 33:18.656
But the planet is now lifeless.

33:18.747 --> 33:22.114
Moya's sensors detect no
microbial chemistry.

33:22.209 --> 33:23.790
What? Nothing?

33:23.878 --> 33:25.539
Krass me, it looks radiated.

33:25.629 --> 33:28.962
Pilot:
The crater pattern indicates,
in all probability,

33:29.049 --> 33:32.257
the destruction by
military conflict.

33:33.387 --> 33:35.378
Rygel:
But that can't be.

33:37.266 --> 33:38.301
Can't see it. I can't see it.

33:38.392 --> 33:39.928
What do you mean, you can't
see it? Look harder!

33:40.019 --> 33:41.099
It's not there.

33:41.187 --> 33:42.802
It was above us!
-It's not there.

33:42.897 --> 33:44.683
It's gone. It's gone.

33:44.773 --> 33:46.638
How? We did everything right.

33:46.734 --> 33:49.146
We set the timeline back on
track. How can it be gone?

33:49.236 --> 33:51.773
Oh, it's not my fault.
It's no one's fault.

33:51.864 --> 33:54.230
I... I didn't mean to...
-It's not your fault.

33:54.325 --> 33:56.190
( screaming )

33:57.328 --> 33:58.534
The Veneks! The Veneks!

33:58.621 --> 33:59.827
Get down!

33:59.914 --> 34:01.745
Cyntrina, come with me now.

34:02.833 --> 34:04.243
It didn't work.

34:04.335 --> 34:07.168
Dacon's dead, and the tear
didn't reappear.
-Aeryn, untie me.

34:07.254 --> 34:10.621
You know, the device said that
he died when he sent the
ceasefire and then,

34:10.716 --> 34:13.799
and then the Veneks offered
peace. Does that sound like
peace to you?

34:13.886 --> 34:15.376
Untie me.
-I listened to you.

34:15.471 --> 34:17.678
I let a man die and we
changed nothing.

34:17.765 --> 34:19.847
He was supposed to die. That's
what happened in history.

34:19.934 --> 34:21.265
But then why isn't
the tear back?

34:21.352 --> 34:24.890
I don't know!

34:24.980 --> 34:28.222
Untie me.
-Can we use our weapons now
or are you still afraid to change things?

34:28.317 --> 34:31.309
Yes, we can use the
weapons. Untie me.

34:32.988 --> 34:34.148
Don't touch him!

34:34.240 --> 34:36.322
Crichton's a soldier.
He can help us fight.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.945
He's a traitor. He tried to
free that dog, Grynes.

34:39.036 --> 34:40.651
Grynes would have brokered
a peace.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.327
What, you think they're
coming to offer peace?

34:42.414 --> 34:44.075
We need him to defend
the monastery.

34:44.166 --> 34:46.407
I won't warn you again.
If you try to release him,
I'll kill you.

34:46.502 --> 34:49.494
And if the Horde gets in here,
they're going to slaughter
every single one of us.

34:49.588 --> 34:50.543
He can help us.

34:50.631 --> 34:52.292
How can he help?

34:55.594 --> 34:58.131
He has a weapon like mine.

34:58.222 --> 35:01.385
Now if you're gonna shoot,
do it now.

35:01.475 --> 35:04.262
Your pulse weapons are
functional? Why haven't
you used them?

35:04.353 --> 35:05.889
Well there's a good question.

35:05.980 --> 35:07.971
Are you ready to get a
ceasefire my way?

35:08.065 --> 35:10.647
Killing Dacon should have
fixed the timeline.

35:10.734 --> 35:12.599
Well, it didn't. Are you ready?

35:12.695 --> 35:13.810
Yes.

35:18.409 --> 35:19.239
Move!

35:24.290 --> 35:25.325
Get to the walkway.

35:25.416 --> 35:27.281
Two guns, Aeryn.
We only have two guns.

35:27.376 --> 35:29.412
Well make it look like more.
-How?

35:29.503 --> 35:32.336
Well, keep firing running
backwards and forwards and
pretend you're an army.

35:32.423 --> 35:34.129
Oh yeah, that's gonna work!

35:34.216 --> 35:35.672
Just do it!

35:40.014 --> 35:40.753
Now!

35:40.848 --> 35:43.430
(Crichton yelling )

35:47.396 --> 35:49.432
Excuse me ladies, man with
a gun coming through!

35:49.523 --> 35:53.266
Pilot:
Chiana, look out the
forward portal.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.190
Not now, Pilot.

35:54.278 --> 35:56.985
Look out the portal.

35:58.282 --> 36:01.319
Rygel:
Gone! The planet, it's gone!

36:01.410 --> 36:03.492
Jool:
It can't be gone. I was just
there two arns ago.

36:03.579 --> 36:05.490
I got shot. I drank piss.

36:05.581 --> 36:07.162
Chiana:
Keeps the comms open.

36:07.249 --> 36:08.580
I'm going out to look for them.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.999
There's nothing there.
It's all gone.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.417
Where are you gonna look?

36:12.504 --> 36:15.621
Hey, how's that arm going?
Has the piss worn off?

36:15.716 --> 36:18.332
Yes. Actually, it's quite sore,
thanks for asking.

36:18.427 --> 36:19.542
( screaming )

36:19.636 --> 36:21.251
And stop screaming.

36:21.347 --> 36:25.386
It is very, very irritating
and I don't want you
melting anything.

36:33.901 --> 36:36.313
Nurse:
Get away! Get away!

36:44.286 --> 36:45.241
Mother!

36:45.329 --> 36:47.820
Stay put, Cyntrina!

36:47.915 --> 36:49.200
D'Argo:
Leave her alone!

37:05.140 --> 37:06.471
What are you doing?

37:06.558 --> 37:08.219
I'm making like an army.

37:10.562 --> 37:11.312
D'Argo!

37:11.397 --> 37:12.386
Whoa.

37:13.232 --> 37:15.223
Holy Montana!

37:19.238 --> 37:21.024
Get to the Med Chamber.

37:29.998 --> 37:31.704
I'm gonna have a heart attack.

37:45.514 --> 37:46.924
Aeryn!

38:12.833 --> 38:14.869
( horn blowing )

38:14.960 --> 38:17.372
The Veneks are retreating!

38:17.463 --> 38:20.125
( horn blowing )

38:35.230 --> 38:36.265
Chiana:
What's going on, Pilot?

38:36.356 --> 38:38.096
I'm getting the dren
kicked out of me.

38:38.192 --> 38:41.935
Moya's registering some kind of
massive gamma disturbance

38:42.029 --> 38:44.236
where the planet used to be.

38:44.323 --> 38:45.483
Can you see anything?

38:45.574 --> 38:46.654
Nothing.

38:46.742 --> 38:48.198
I can't control this.

38:48.285 --> 38:51.243
Ohh! It's back.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.786
It's back.

38:52.873 --> 38:55.114
No death, no death!

38:55.876 --> 38:57.366
It's back. It's back.

38:57.461 --> 38:59.497
It's back. No death.

38:59.588 --> 39:00.873
Come on. Now, quick.

39:00.964 --> 39:02.670
Aeryn:
Let's go.

39:02.758 --> 39:04.339
It will be safer if we just
go now and don't tell
her anything.

39:04.426 --> 39:06.041
I'll just be 30 microts.
-Crichton.

39:06.136 --> 39:08.343
I won't tell her anything.

39:13.435 --> 39:15.141
Are you leaving?

39:15.229 --> 39:17.345
I will be leaving soon, yes.

39:18.815 --> 39:21.352
Will I ever see you again?

39:21.443 --> 39:23.980
How long do your people live?

39:24.071 --> 39:27.484
My mother's sire lived
for 700 cycles.

39:29.201 --> 39:31.988
Well, maybe I'll see you again
when you grow up.

39:39.920 --> 39:41.660
Crichton:
We have to go.

39:41.755 --> 39:44.041
If you're not here, the Veneks
will murder us.

39:44.132 --> 39:47.215
No, no. If there's no soldiers
here they'll offer a ceasefire.

39:47.302 --> 39:48.917
How do you know that?

39:49.012 --> 39:51.219
Ijust... do.

39:51.306 --> 39:54.594
Veneks are predators.
They kill.

39:54.685 --> 39:58.098
That's what they do.
They don't have ceasefires.

39:59.940 --> 40:01.680
Please.

40:04.778 --> 40:07.064
At least leave your weapons...

40:07.155 --> 40:09.441
No. I... I can't.

40:10.242 --> 40:12.358
I'm sorry.

40:14.246 --> 40:16.908
You're gonna be safe.

40:16.999 --> 40:18.660
I promise.

40:34.766 --> 40:37.143
(Stark groaning loudly)

40:38.061 --> 40:39.221
Where's Aeryn?

40:39.313 --> 40:41.178
She should be here.
She left ahead of me.

40:41.273 --> 40:42.479
Aeryn!

40:59.249 --> 41:00.864
Aeryn!

41:11.428 --> 41:13.043
Aeryn!

41:15.390 --> 41:16.550
Sorry.

41:16.642 --> 41:19.099
Okay, let's get the frell
out of here.

41:19.186 --> 41:21.268
( screaming )

41:29.071 --> 41:32.029
Chiana:
On Moya, we registered every
change as it happened.

41:32.115 --> 41:34.197
First, there were, there
were millions dead.

41:34.284 --> 41:36.900
And then the planet disappeared,
and then it came back.

41:36.995 --> 41:40.283
I almost crashed the pod
trying to get it in here.

41:40.374 --> 41:42.330
And nothing changed on Moya?

41:42.417 --> 41:43.372
No.

41:43.460 --> 41:45.701
Only the planet was affected
by what you did.

41:45.796 --> 41:48.287
Everything's the same except...

41:49.800 --> 41:52.041
So is there any chance
you can go back?

41:52.135 --> 41:55.127
No. The tear is
no longer stable.

41:55.222 --> 41:57.929
Stark tried, but he can't
get us back through.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.472
Does Crichton know that?

41:59.559 --> 42:01.550
Yes, he does.

42:01.645 --> 42:04.603
So who's gonna get him
back on Moya?

42:04.690 --> 42:06.305
|Wi||.

42:06.400 --> 42:07.230
Okay.

42:07.317 --> 42:09.103
Thank you.

42:42.185 --> 42:43.595
731%.:
955757;

42:46.565 --> 42:48.476
I screwed up.

42:48.567 --> 42:50.353
You...

42:52.654 --> 42:55.361
We did what we could.

42:58.410 --> 43:00.150
Why would they do that?

43:00.245 --> 43:02.486
What's the point?

43:05.250 --> 43:08.367
There probably was no point.

43:12.048 --> 43:14.209
You must tell me. Where are the
soldiers who were here?

43:14.301 --> 43:16.917
I know nothing. They... they
just left. I don't know
where they went.

43:17.012 --> 43:19.298
They're not here.
-No one could get past
my forces.

43:19.389 --> 43:21.550
Tell me where they are.
I can't control the
Horde unless...

43:21.641 --> 43:24.724
Crichton said they were going
to escape by the cliffs but...

43:24.811 --> 43:27.553
Too many Veneks have died here.
The bloodlust is on them!

43:27.647 --> 43:29.478
I need to give the
Horde something.

43:29.566 --> 43:31.477
Where are the pulse weapons
you fired on us?!

43:31.568 --> 43:33.684
Crichton took them. Please...

43:33.779 --> 43:38.239
Please, I don't know where
they've gone. I don't know.

43:38.325 --> 43:42.238
I can't stop the Horde unless
you tell me where this
Crichton is!

43:42.329 --> 43:45.036
I don't know. I don't know!

43:45.499 --> 43:46.454
Crichton!

43:46.541 --> 43:48.281
No! Not yet!

43:48.376 --> 43:49.286
Crichton!

43:49.377 --> 43:51.117
( screaming )

43:51.213 --> 43:53.329
(gunfire)

43:53.673 --> 43:55.174
No!

43:55.258 --> 43:56.919
( screaming )

44:44.516 --> 44:48.100
(sighs)
