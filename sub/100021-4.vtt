00:00.110 --> 00:02.149
Previously on "Mr. Mercedes"...

00:02.150 --> 00:03.479
All of 'em could have
could have conceivably

00:03.480 --> 00:04.790
walked to the crash site.

00:04.797 --> 00:06.257
So, what's the next step?

00:06.258 --> 00:09.169
- Oh! Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Danielle!

00:09.170 --> 00:11.799
I'm gonna get all my
stuff, because I am done.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.119
Got any of John Rothstein's books?

00:13.120 --> 00:15.009
- Sold out.
- What about first editions?

00:15.010 --> 00:16.999
- Do you know how much they're worth?
- If it's a long letter,

00:17.000 --> 00:19.227
could be worth a million, at least.

00:19.228 --> 00:21.313
It's the way he was acting, fishing.

00:21.314 --> 00:22.360
That's him.

00:22.370 --> 00:24.600
- He's not the only one.
- What?

00:24.608 --> 00:27.693
That's the detective that
broke the Mr. Mercedes case.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.025
You're positive he was shot here?

00:29.026 --> 00:31.364
We found the drill that was
used to burrow into his head.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.654
You got no leads at all, huh?

00:32.655 --> 00:36.036
- No. We found the writings at the house.
- Most likely stolen.

00:36.037 --> 00:37.060
It's him.

00:37.860 --> 00:39.664
Lou passed her competency exam.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.792
- What?
- She's going to trial.

00:50.460 --> 00:51.819
Looks like you're making

00:51.820 --> 00:53.596
a pretty good life for yourself...

00:53.597 --> 00:57.019
photos of houses where
they found a dead guy.

00:57.020 --> 00:59.643
I think I'm gonna take a picture of...

01:18.960 --> 01:21.869
I miss Satan. Really, I do.

01:21.870 --> 01:24.519
Satan used to be somebody...

01:24.520 --> 01:27.849
the Prince of Fucking Darkness.

01:27.850 --> 01:29.759
Pilgrims knew him.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.619
They burned witches

01:31.620 --> 01:36.519
because Satan's got some evil
goddamn friends out there.

01:36.520 --> 01:41.779
The worst crime that my
generation ever committed

01:41.780 --> 01:44.819
is that we murdered Satan.

01:44.820 --> 01:47.379
Now nobody's evil.

01:47.380 --> 01:49.639
They're damaged, they're misunderstood,

01:49.640 --> 01:52.449
they're unloved, but they're not evil.

01:52.450 --> 01:55.479
God forbid you say that.

01:55.480 --> 01:57.240
But here's a problem.

01:58.300 --> 01:59.990
If there is no Satan,

01:59.995 --> 02:02.829
then there is no God.

02:02.830 --> 02:05.820
And where there's no God,

02:05.834 --> 02:08.709
there's Mr. Mercedes

02:08.710 --> 02:12.859
plowing into a bunch of innocent people

02:12.860 --> 02:14.802
looking for jobs.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.637
Hodges.

02:20.970 --> 02:23.219
W-w-w-w-wait!

02:23.220 --> 02:26.271
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

02:26.272 --> 02:27.979
No! Oh!

02:27.980 --> 02:29.979
No, no, ow, ow!

02:29.980 --> 02:31.192
Aah!

02:31.193 --> 02:34.028
It was proof that Satan lives,

02:34.029 --> 02:37.824
and we are all...

02:37.825 --> 02:44.831
... just too fucking weak to admit it.

02:55.426 --> 02:57.910
Okay, okay, okay.

03:02.330 --> 03:04.420
Coming, coming.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.690
What the hell time is it?

03:11.692 --> 03:15.399
7:45. Known in Ohio as morning.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.560
Are you all right?

03:17.570 --> 03:20.951
Was having a fuck of a nightmare.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.389
There's both a doorbell to ring

03:27.390 --> 03:28.719
and a door to knock on, you know.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.560
- What are you doing?
- I'm cleaning.

03:30.570 --> 03:32.359
What does it look like I'm doing?

03:32.360 --> 03:34.529
Spilled some red wine.

03:34.530 --> 03:35.859
What are you doing?

03:35.860 --> 03:37.219
I maybe have a lead.

03:37.220 --> 03:39.635
I got a high school buddy, Andy
Halliday, runs an old bookstore.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.929
Yeah, you told me. You got a bite?

03:41.930 --> 03:43.699
Well, some kid came into the bookstore

03:43.700 --> 03:46.519
asking about Rothstein.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.021
That kid!

03:51.860 --> 03:55.109
We have ourselves... a positive ID.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.639
That's the Saubers family.

03:57.640 --> 03:58.859
Fuck.

03:58.860 --> 04:02.034
I've seen this kid playing with his dog.

04:03.440 --> 04:06.949
There's also a private
detective on the sniff.

04:06.950 --> 04:10.379
Came to the bookstore
asking about Rothstein.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.250
Here.

04:15.580 --> 04:17.019
Bill Hodges.

04:17.019 --> 04:19.509
- You know him?
- I know Bill.

04:19.510 --> 04:22.679
He's a bloodhound, only less handsome.

04:22.680 --> 04:25.029
- You say he's sniffing?
- Seems so.

04:25.030 --> 04:27.139
I don't like that.

04:27.140 --> 04:30.839
Then again, he could lead
us to the holy grail.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.759
If he's looking for those manuscripts,

04:32.760 --> 04:35.650
we should keep close tabs, hmm?

04:36.900 --> 04:39.709
The man is a bloodhound.

05:50.640 --> 05:53.640
Wow, a tie. What's the occasion?

05:53.650 --> 05:55.639
Going to court.

05:55.640 --> 05:58.640
The trial of the woman who
killed Brady Hartsfield.

05:58.650 --> 06:01.299
You're going?

06:01.300 --> 06:05.069
Yeah, I have to, for whatever reason.

06:08.040 --> 06:12.610
Pete, we, uh, we got another
envelope this morning.

06:13.700 --> 06:16.040
$9,000.

06:16.043 --> 06:20.149
Bringing the total up to $32,000.

06:20.150 --> 06:22.299
Oh, my God.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.879
You have no idea where
this is coming from?

06:24.880 --> 06:27.719
Actually, I do.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.999
Pete, you've been pretty...

06:30.000 --> 06:33.509
secretive as of late.

06:33.510 --> 06:36.379
My mind keeps going to those
expensive shoes that you've got.

06:36.380 --> 06:37.438
I just can't help but think...

06:37.439 --> 06:38.899
- Dad...
- Just let me finish, Pete, okay?

06:38.900 --> 06:40.439
You're not in trouble.

06:40.440 --> 06:42.900
Or I should say you're
not in trouble with me.

06:45.200 --> 06:49.534
If you need help, let me help you.

06:52.140 --> 06:53.740
I don't need help.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.249
Where'd you get the money?

06:58.250 --> 07:01.139
It's not coming from me.

07:01.140 --> 07:02.579
I promise.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.181
Yes, perfect. Thank you. You too.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.879
Hey. I have some good news.

07:13.880 --> 07:14.889
Good.

07:14.890 --> 07:18.199
Okay, so it turns out
Rothstein took out insurance.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.419
Yeah.

07:19.420 --> 07:21.719
Yeah, it's called, um,
stated value coverage,

07:21.720 --> 07:23.399
which basically means
the cost of replacing

07:23.400 --> 07:25.060
whatever was in the safe.

07:25.070 --> 07:28.489
Stated value coverage,
as in subject to appraisal.

07:28.490 --> 07:29.741
Exactly.

07:31.220 --> 07:33.739
- Books.
- Yeah, it has to be.

07:33.740 --> 07:36.519
His daughter said that he
never stopped writing.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.560
I mean, she said that he
had tons of notebooks,

07:38.570 --> 07:40.099
just unpublished manuscripts.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.127
Tell him the best part.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.129
So the insurance company, Hannaford...

07:44.130 --> 07:46.819
they've offered a reward:

07:46.820 --> 07:49.640
$700,000 for any information

07:49.650 --> 07:51.760
that would lead to the
manuscript's recovery.

07:51.770 --> 07:53.432
I mean, that means we're
no longer doing this

07:53.433 --> 07:56.279
just for the love of
American literature.

07:56.280 --> 07:58.340
This is much bigger now.
We're talking money.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.809
$700,000.

08:00.810 --> 08:01.939
Mm-hmm.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.059
And maybe another break.

08:03.060 --> 08:04.599
I just got off the phone
with Shirley Landon.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.139
She's an EMT.

08:06.140 --> 08:08.194
Stan the Man, the guy that
was found dead in the truck,

08:08.195 --> 08:09.379
the one that you think
was planted there?

08:09.380 --> 08:11.379
- Yeah.
- Turns out, she remembers him.

08:11.380 --> 08:13.639
Apparently, he dropped off
another half-dead guy

08:13.640 --> 08:17.539
off at the hospital like some,
uh, Good Samaritan drop-off?

08:17.540 --> 08:18.620
When?

08:19.700 --> 08:21.540
The night of Rothstein's murder.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.795
- Well, let's go.
- No, no, you need to be in court.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.499
Jerome, you go to the hospital.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.939
We're talking about a
lead that could bring us

08:27.940 --> 08:29.130
straight to those books, Holly.

08:29.134 --> 08:32.759
I realize that, and also
possibly $3/4 million.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.339
But we need to be in court.

08:34.340 --> 08:37.139
And by court order, in case you forgot.

08:37.140 --> 08:39.679
I'll go. I'll take the information.

08:39.679 --> 08:41.159
Yes.

08:42.260 --> 08:44.524
Take information. Don't give any.
Do you understand?

08:44.525 --> 08:45.729
Sí, kemosabe.

08:45.730 --> 08:46.959
- What does that mean?
- Bill.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.652
It means you're no longer a lone ranger.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.738
You have two sidekicks right here.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.823
Come on. We really have to go.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.699
Ciao.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.202
Yes!

08:56.203 --> 08:59.529
This ups the ante, and
not in a good way.

08:59.530 --> 09:00.859
This reward money?

09:00.860 --> 09:03.439
Other people are gonna be lookin'.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.334
Morris, are you listening to me?

09:05.335 --> 09:07.399
- I'm listening.
- We need to turn the screws

09:07.400 --> 09:08.999
on this Saubers kid now.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.508
Or Hodges.

09:10.509 --> 09:11.819
Hodges doesn't have the books.

09:11.820 --> 09:13.802
He's just looking for 'em like we are.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.039
But he may have more
information than we do.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.359
That kid lives in the area.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.739
He was in the bookstore
asking about Rothstein,

09:20.740 --> 09:21.919
what we was worth.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.439
He's our best bet.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.879
The question is, how do we make our play

09:25.880 --> 09:27.567
without tipping our own hand?

09:30.400 --> 09:32.279
I would've thought she'd be back by now.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.540
'Scuse me?

09:35.780 --> 09:37.880
Danielle.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.413
Oh, for God's sake.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.649
She didn't even pack up her shit.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.409
Not even a note.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.712
You really loved her.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.039
I just don't get it.

09:50.040 --> 09:53.919
Morris, you're a nice guy,

09:53.920 --> 09:56.059
good-looking.

09:56.060 --> 09:59.199
But it's not the case that...

09:59.200 --> 10:01.019
well, whatever women find in you,

10:01.020 --> 10:02.549
they can find elsewhere,

10:02.550 --> 10:05.399
and I don't say that to be mean.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.139
Every woman I've ever
cared for has hurt me...

10:08.140 --> 10:09.809
my mother, Danielle.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.899
I never hurt ya.

10:10.900 --> 10:13.279
You raped me when I was 13.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.399
But it was loving.

10:15.400 --> 10:18.980
Set her free! Set her free!

10:19.000 --> 10:22.189
Set her free! Set her free!

10:23.800 --> 10:25.829
He wants us all in chambers?

10:25.830 --> 10:27.219
According to the clerk.

10:27.220 --> 10:28.579
Why the fuck why?

10:28.580 --> 10:30.219
With this judge, anybody's guess.

10:30.220 --> 10:32.779
- Do not threaten him.
- I'm not gonna threaten him.

10:32.780 --> 10:36.261
Yeah, well... just don't.

10:38.300 --> 10:42.099
As you well know, I've tried to
prevent this trial from happening.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.639
That being said, Ms. Linklatter,

10:44.640 --> 10:46.939
you have been found competent,
and it is therefore

10:46.940 --> 10:49.139
your legal right to
have your day in court.

10:49.140 --> 10:52.699
And as loose a cannon
as I might strike you,

10:52.700 --> 10:56.319
and certainly you, the law wins out.

10:56.320 --> 10:59.539
American exceptionalism
is alive in the courtroom,

10:59.540 --> 11:00.899
especially mine.

11:00.900 --> 11:03.619
Noble principles of jurisprudence

11:03.620 --> 11:07.659
let no man make a mockery thereof.

11:07.660 --> 11:12.339
For me to allow the defense
to argue self-defense,

11:12.340 --> 11:14.798
that would be such a mockery.

11:14.799 --> 11:18.510
So that affirmative defense is denied.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.469
Judge, you cannot do that.

11:20.470 --> 11:22.139
I can. I do.

11:22.140 --> 11:26.599
I must. The facts do not
support self-defense, mm.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.919
Nor will I allow you to
argue jury nullification.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.469
You might as well direct the verdict

11:30.470 --> 11:31.815
in favor of the prosecution.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.986
That authority is not available to me.

11:36.488 --> 11:41.533
Ms. Linklatter, you continue to refuse

11:41.534 --> 11:45.329
any plea deals, which is misguided.

11:45.330 --> 11:50.719
So I've summoned Mr. Hodges,
Ms. Gibney to be here for this.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.039
It's come to my attention

11:53.040 --> 11:55.004
that these are the people
who best have your ear,

11:55.005 --> 11:57.019
and I'm hopeful that they will
be able to get through to you

11:57.020 --> 11:58.139
in a way that I cannot,

11:58.140 --> 12:01.299
because if you continue to
go through with this trial,

12:01.300 --> 12:05.433
it is my considered and strong
opinion that you will lose.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.389
Question.

12:07.390 --> 12:09.959
Uh...

12:09.960 --> 12:11.959
if I'm to tell you to go fuck yourself,

12:11.960 --> 12:15.109
should I do that now or wait
till we're in the room?

12:16.903 --> 12:19.689
Very solid attempt to incur my bias!

12:19.690 --> 12:21.619
Not gonna...

12:21.620 --> 12:23.149
not gonna happen.

12:23.150 --> 12:28.455
Well, the good news is
that I... am human.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.374
Part of me is...

12:30.375 --> 12:33.839
well, glad that you killed
that son of a bitch

12:33.840 --> 12:35.380
Brady Hartsfield.

12:36.720 --> 12:40.229
But the bad news is that
once I put on this robe...

12:42.760 --> 12:45.049
I live up to it.

12:45.050 --> 12:47.379
I'm gonna leave the room
to the defense team

12:47.380 --> 12:49.226
so that you can confer.

12:49.227 --> 12:52.269
We don't need to confer.
Let's just do this.

12:52.270 --> 12:53.479
Time's a-wastin'.

12:53.480 --> 12:56.067
- Lou.
- This doesn't involve you, Kermit.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.829
Um, I-I'll take the room

13:00.830 --> 13:03.030
if your offer's still good... alone.

13:06.500 --> 13:09.360
I have nothing to say to you.

13:11.300 --> 13:15.080
Then it falls to me to do the talkin'.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.925
You called me Kermit.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.595
It's your name.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.348
Brady tell you that?

13:27.974 --> 13:30.226
Holly tells me that he talks to you.

13:30.227 --> 13:33.139
Well, she shouldn't have done that.

13:33.140 --> 13:35.139
I told her that in confidence.

13:35.140 --> 13:37.859
Listen, I'm no shrink.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.649
Oh, well, we should
leave it at that, then.

13:40.650 --> 13:43.156
But you need to let Brady go.

13:48.240 --> 13:50.370
Easier said than done.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.956
Lou.

13:52.957 --> 13:57.749
He's the reason why I'm in here at all.

13:57.750 --> 14:00.039
But to get you out of here,

14:00.040 --> 14:02.759
which is the mission
of the fucking day...

14:04.080 --> 14:09.539
You have to keep the
man out of your head.

14:09.540 --> 14:12.139
I can't.

14:12.140 --> 14:14.740
He's knockin' around in my brain too.

14:16.020 --> 14:19.560
At the end of the day, we're
all fucking head cases.

14:19.570 --> 14:23.079
I get it.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.155
But our only hope

14:25.156 --> 14:27.599
is to hang on to our wits,

14:27.600 --> 14:29.451
even if only by a thread.

14:29.452 --> 14:33.540
You need to be hanging on to yours.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.586
I don't see how you win this trial.

14:50.682 --> 14:54.489
With public sentiment on one's side,

14:54.490 --> 14:56.646
nothing can fail.

14:59.270 --> 15:01.025
Brady say that, did he?

15:03.920 --> 15:05.980
It's Abraham Lincoln.

15:09.960 --> 15:13.149
I killed the biggest monster...

15:13.150 --> 15:16.949
ever in the history of this town.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.252
The public is gonna set me free.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.429
The facts don't support her.

15:26.430 --> 15:28.659
Set her free!

15:28.660 --> 15:30.580
The law doesn't.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.549
She's off in the fuckin' head.

15:38.550 --> 15:39.900
Yeah.

15:42.200 --> 15:45.737
I don't see how this hand
gets played. I really don't.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.699
Well, um, Finkelstein is good.

15:50.700 --> 15:53.786
I mean, we just have to
hope he's great, I guess?

15:56.280 --> 15:58.040
You fancy him, don't ya?

15:58.041 --> 15:59.625
What?

15:59.626 --> 16:01.376
Finkelstein.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.959
I do not fancy him.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.499
It's not a crime.

16:05.500 --> 16:06.840
The makeup.

16:06.850 --> 16:07.999
That looks to be a new dress.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.510
Just open the door.

16:18.360 --> 16:21.239
Mm. What's your perfume?

16:21.240 --> 16:23.649
Vanilla? You smell like cookie dough.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.419
You don't get to say
things like that to me.

16:25.420 --> 16:27.559
- Why not?
- Because you're my boss, okay?

16:27.560 --> 16:30.099
You're not supposed to take
note of how I look or smell.

16:30.100 --> 16:32.589
It's practically illegal for you
to even notice I'm a woman.

16:32.590 --> 16:34.349
Don't you read?

16:34.350 --> 16:37.799
And where would I read that
fuckshit, on your Facebook?

16:37.800 --> 16:40.269
I'm not allowed to notice ya as a woman?

16:40.270 --> 16:42.839
Would lunatic be okay, gender neutral?

16:42.840 --> 16:45.462
- Jesus fuckin' balls.
- Okay.

16:45.463 --> 16:49.039
♪ Just the same old thing ♪

16:52.011 --> 16:54.619
♪ Just the same old thing ♪

16:57.740 --> 17:01.779
♪ No matter how much
love you try to bring ♪

17:04.232 --> 17:08.290
♪ Just the same old thing ♪

18:05.940 --> 18:07.960
You want to tell me

18:07.962 --> 18:10.130
why you didn't finish the assignment?

18:10.131 --> 18:12.209
I didn't see the point.

18:12.210 --> 18:13.460
You didn't see the point?

18:13.470 --> 18:16.439
How would it benefit mankind?

18:16.440 --> 18:19.199
I let that question be my compass.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.399
And finishing the assignment...

18:21.400 --> 18:24.299
I didn't see how it
would improve mankind.

18:24.300 --> 18:25.999
You never miss a chance

18:26.000 --> 18:28.232
to be a smartass, do you, Morris?

18:30.230 --> 18:33.019
I've decided instead of a detention,

18:33.020 --> 18:35.279
I'm gonna give you something else.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.979
I'm gonna give you something
a little more memorable.

18:39.820 --> 18:42.919
This book is not on the...

18:42.920 --> 18:45.899
school board's approved reading list.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.179
I might get into trouble
for giving it to you.

18:48.180 --> 18:49.337
At least I hope so.

18:53.180 --> 18:55.590
You and Jimmy Gold will get along.

18:55.593 --> 19:00.439
He's a sarcastic,
self-hating little shit

19:00.440 --> 19:02.475
just like you.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.600
_

19:27.240 --> 19:30.540
Hey. How'd it go?

19:30.545 --> 19:32.963
No pay dirt, but I've got something.

19:32.964 --> 19:34.340
Go on.

19:35.460 --> 19:38.119
Um... okay.

19:38.120 --> 19:41.909
Well, Stan McNair delivered a man,

19:41.910 --> 19:43.141
mid-30s, to the hospital.

19:43.142 --> 19:45.699
Said he found him on the side
of the road on Route Six.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.449
Apparently, he was hit by a car.

19:47.450 --> 19:48.475
Took him to the hospital,

19:48.476 --> 19:50.579
and the man gave the
hospital a fake name,

19:50.580 --> 19:53.023
only to leave the next day
and never be seen again.

19:53.024 --> 19:55.734
Did they get anything
on him... DNA, photos?

19:55.735 --> 19:57.419
Uh... well, they took his blood,

19:57.420 --> 19:59.157
so I guess they have his DNA.

19:59.158 --> 20:03.939
But they're just grainy photos
from a... old corridor cam.

20:03.940 --> 20:05.559
Just shows a man walking out,

20:05.560 --> 20:06.880
but you can't even recognize him.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.539
Shit.

20:09.540 --> 20:13.600
But... I have a theory.

20:14.710 --> 20:15.960
This should be good.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.009
- 'Scuse me?
- All right.

20:19.010 --> 20:21.220
What's your theory?

20:22.340 --> 20:24.420
Okay.

20:26.460 --> 20:29.519
The John Doe patient was driving
the truck that crashed.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.229
He crawls out of the ditch,

20:31.230 --> 20:33.039
and that's when Stan the
repair guy finds him

20:33.040 --> 20:34.314
and takes him to the hospital.

20:34.315 --> 20:36.079
John Doe patient leaves the hospital

20:36.080 --> 20:38.025
to find Stan the Man, probably to,

20:38.026 --> 20:39.639
you know, find his stolen goods...

20:39.640 --> 20:41.239
and kills him,

20:41.240 --> 20:42.573
puts him in the truck.

20:42.574 --> 20:45.319
Why is this Shirley person
telling you all this?

20:45.320 --> 20:49.207
I don't know, but she seems
to be telling everybody.

20:52.040 --> 20:53.799
You knew about this.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.879
It's still fluid, and we
haven't positively confirmed

20:55.880 --> 20:58.019
that it was Stan McNair that dropped
the guy off at the hospital.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.714
Yeah, you have a pretty good idea.

20:59.715 --> 21:01.699
- Calm down.
- You didn't let me in on it.

21:01.700 --> 21:03.499
We get the information, we confirm it,

21:03.500 --> 21:04.619
- and then I give it to you.
- That's bullshit.

21:04.620 --> 21:07.139
We made a deal... you scratch
my balls, I scratch yours.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.183
We didn't make that deal.
Thanks for the visual.

21:09.184 --> 21:11.479
What about the guy at the hospital?

21:11.480 --> 21:12.604
You got a bead on him?

21:12.605 --> 21:15.309
No. But we're working with
one of the treating nurses

21:15.310 --> 21:16.739
to come up with a composite sketch.

21:16.740 --> 21:19.028
Which you will give
straight to me, right?

21:20.820 --> 21:22.219
This is about that reward

21:22.220 --> 21:23.649
that's got your balls
all itchy, isn't it?

21:23.650 --> 21:25.460
No, it's the principle.
We agreed to keep each other

21:25.470 --> 21:26.659
in our respective loops.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.411
Bill, you're a little amped up, okay?

21:28.412 --> 21:30.340
I'm not keeping anything
from you, I swear.

21:30.350 --> 21:32.500
Fucking look at me when
you say that, will ya?

21:33.620 --> 21:36.460
I am not keeping anything
from you, Bill Hodges.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.589
What are you gonna testify to?

21:41.590 --> 21:42.959
- I'm sorry?
- Lou's case.

21:42.960 --> 21:46.385
You're número uno on the
prosecution's witness list.

21:46.386 --> 21:48.558
I'm gonna go in and
tell them what I saw.

21:49.870 --> 21:51.642
If you bury her, I'll fucking...

21:51.643 --> 21:53.719
Oh, what the fuck?
I do not have it out for Lou.

21:53.720 --> 21:56.019
What is this, "Accuse
Your Local Latino" Day?

21:56.020 --> 21:58.192
What exactly do ya plan to say?

21:59.680 --> 22:03.259
I plan to say what we both saw
happen in that courtroom.

22:03.260 --> 22:05.559
I'm not about to commit perjury.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.869
And why can't you get Lou
to cop to this plea?

22:07.870 --> 22:09.640
'Cause I can't.

22:09.650 --> 22:12.081
She's convinced the
jury will set her free.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.709
Involuntary manslaughter?

22:16.710 --> 22:18.959
Yeah.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.963
I don't think the DA would go for that.

22:20.964 --> 22:22.719
I don't need the DA to go for it

22:22.720 --> 22:24.699
because I'm not looking
for a plea or a deal.

22:24.700 --> 22:27.339
I just need you to argue
that that's what it was.

22:27.340 --> 22:30.339
And since involuntary
manslaughter's not on the menu,

22:30.340 --> 22:31.679
the only choice the jury will have

22:31.680 --> 22:35.039
will be between first-degree
and not guilty,

22:35.040 --> 22:36.856
and I'm betting they're
gonna choose the latter.

22:36.857 --> 22:40.160
The DA can always add the
lesser included offense

22:40.170 --> 22:43.696
like involuntary, in which case
the jury would have a choice.

22:43.697 --> 22:45.179
All right.

22:45.180 --> 22:47.349
So then they'd choose
involuntary manslaughter,

22:47.350 --> 22:48.359
which is six to eight.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.499
Factoring in mitigating circumstances

22:50.500 --> 22:53.872
and time already served,
I could be out in 18 months.

22:53.873 --> 22:57.610
That... I can fucking handle.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.963
So she never left the house... not once?

23:01.964 --> 23:03.173
Not once.

23:03.174 --> 23:05.319
I don't understand.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.279
I know Susie Banks at Safeway.

23:07.280 --> 23:09.359
She says Marjorie Saubers
goes grocery shopping

23:09.360 --> 23:11.319
every Wednesday, regular as clockwork.

23:11.320 --> 23:13.392
And she usually takes the
crippled husband with her.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.959
Well, she didn't go today.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.396
I had no chance to go inside. Trust me.

23:17.397 --> 23:19.499
I do not like this.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.199
This reward money...

23:21.200 --> 23:23.199
there are gonna be more
scavengers in the area,

23:23.200 --> 23:24.679
all on the sniff.

23:24.680 --> 23:27.823
Time is of the goddamn essence.

23:29.140 --> 23:30.451
Morris.

23:31.560 --> 23:34.740
Danielly-belle didn't know
about all this, did she?

23:34.747 --> 23:36.579
No.

23:36.580 --> 23:38.409
You sure?

23:38.410 --> 23:41.878
'Cause bitchy-ass girlfriends
have a way of knowing things.

23:41.879 --> 23:44.689
And she in particular
was clearly a snoop.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.599
She followed you here.

23:46.600 --> 23:49.387
Who knows what other
suspicions she may have had.

23:51.400 --> 23:52.799
Why past tense?

23:52.800 --> 23:54.259
- What?
- You said,

23:54.260 --> 23:57.143
"What other suspicions
she may have had."

23:57.144 --> 23:59.229
Past tense, like...

23:59.230 --> 24:00.519
she's no more.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.219
She is no more.

24:02.220 --> 24:04.339
She's no more your girlfriend.

24:04.340 --> 24:07.299
Best for you to be thinking
of her as past tense too,

24:07.300 --> 24:10.940
'cause that's what she is... gone.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.330
Why are you lookin' at me like that?

24:20.120 --> 24:21.580
Nothing.

24:22.900 --> 24:25.359
Tomorrow. Hell or high water,

24:25.360 --> 24:26.729
we're searching the Saubers' house.

24:26.730 --> 24:27.739
I'll go with ya.

24:27.740 --> 24:30.319
- I'm leaving.
- Going where?

24:30.320 --> 24:33.431
Home. It's late, you know?
I-I got a big day ahead.

24:33.432 --> 24:35.179
We both got a lotta tension built up.

24:35.180 --> 24:37.559
You don't think maybe we should
burn a little bit of it off?

24:37.560 --> 24:39.809
No. I do not.

24:39.810 --> 24:41.519
You look too pent up to sleep.

24:41.520 --> 24:43.859
And Danielle's not there
to decompress you.

24:43.860 --> 24:46.485
- Forget it!
- What did you say?

24:49.590 --> 24:50.719
I said forget it.

24:50.720 --> 24:52.279
Don't make me come over there

24:52.280 --> 24:54.243
and sit on your head, Morris.

24:59.450 --> 25:01.560
Good night, Alma.

25:08.620 --> 25:13.079
The DA won't dare offer
involuntary manslaughter

25:13.080 --> 25:14.469
for fear the jury will jump at that.

25:14.470 --> 25:17.719
But if they don't think
it's first-degree

25:17.720 --> 25:20.399
and first-degree is the
only charge on the menu,

25:20.400 --> 25:23.289
then they gotta come
back with "not guilty."

25:23.290 --> 25:25.119
- Right.
- I mean, it's brilliant, actually,

25:25.120 --> 25:28.359
which brings me back to
somebody's helping her. Huh?

25:28.360 --> 25:32.655
Well... maybe your legal eagle
acumen is rubbing off on her.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.839
- Mm?
- You know, I hear that happens

25:34.840 --> 25:36.739
when people spend a lot
of time together, so...

25:36.740 --> 25:38.120
Am I rubbing off on you?

25:39.538 --> 25:41.219
Sorry.

25:42.740 --> 25:44.840
- No, I-I'm sorry.
- No.

25:44.850 --> 25:46.836
I shouldn't have said that.
That was wrong.

25:46.837 --> 25:50.715
No, no, it wasn't wrong.
I just... wasn't ready for it.

25:50.716 --> 25:53.449
But I don't...

25:53.450 --> 25:56.513
which I may never be, so...

25:58.849 --> 26:00.642
May I ask a question?

26:00.643 --> 26:03.139
Of course.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.849
Are we on a date?

26:09.480 --> 26:10.778
Would you like it to be?

26:12.090 --> 26:15.479
Well... what I'd like is for
you to answer my question

26:15.480 --> 26:18.576
with something other
than another question.

26:21.950 --> 26:24.458
We're having dinner,
discussing the case.

26:25.780 --> 26:28.300
Right. Okay.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.799
But...

26:32.800 --> 26:36.219
I'm hoping that it will
feel a little like a date

26:36.220 --> 26:40.760
so if we ever were to have one,

26:40.770 --> 26:43.499
it won't be such a jolt.

28:46.010 --> 28:47.810
Why was she on fire?

28:50.354 --> 28:51.980
What?

28:51.981 --> 28:54.774
Lou! What do you think that was about?

28:54.775 --> 28:57.270
Her being on fire?

28:58.460 --> 29:00.730
Shit if I know.

29:03.540 --> 29:07.179
Something about Satan.

29:07.180 --> 29:11.569
Rothstein was banging on
about needing him back.

29:11.570 --> 29:12.959
Satan?

29:12.960 --> 29:15.349
Yeah, the world needs him back

29:15.350 --> 29:17.547
because he's better
than the alternative.

29:17.548 --> 29:18.919
Oh-ho! God?

29:20.500 --> 29:21.927
People.

29:23.260 --> 29:26.220
Well, that actually sounds like him.

29:27.640 --> 29:30.399
Maybe people do haunt us.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.439
Rothstein certainly had
a way of haunting me.

29:33.440 --> 29:36.639
That's really why I'm
teaching him again.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.359
How did the class go?

29:38.360 --> 29:41.139
You know, not so bad.

29:41.140 --> 29:44.741
Kids today, they think
everything is stupid.

29:44.742 --> 29:47.719
Jonathan Swift's "A Modest Proposal"...

29:47.720 --> 29:49.529
stupid.

29:49.530 --> 29:53.179
"Young Goodman Brown," by
Nathanial Hawthorne...

29:53.180 --> 29:56.459
so stupid.

29:56.460 --> 29:58.599
But when I...

29:58.600 --> 30:03.969
when I set the table with
the Jimmy Gold trilogy,

30:03.970 --> 30:05.637
I think I had them.

30:06.950 --> 30:08.722
Wait'll they actually read them.

30:08.723 --> 30:11.679
You know, John always said
you gotta grab 'em by the balls.

30:11.680 --> 30:13.728
Course, I'm not allowed to do that.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.646
Yeah. It's not fair.

30:25.020 --> 30:26.639
What's the matter?

30:26.640 --> 30:30.412
Maybe I'm the Satan in the dream.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.749
Okay. Why?

30:34.750 --> 30:38.579
Everybody I touch suffers...

30:38.580 --> 30:41.339
my wife, my daughter, Janey, now Lou.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.716
- Oh, come on.
- You better mind yourself.

30:43.717 --> 30:45.803
Nah, just bear with me.

30:49.540 --> 30:54.159
From what I remember in "The Inferno"...

30:54.160 --> 30:57.179
Dante talked about Satan as a...

30:57.180 --> 31:01.679
a nonentity, kind of an absence,

31:01.680 --> 31:04.700
which I definitely was for my family.

31:06.120 --> 31:10.460
He said that the empty
sack causes the suffering.

31:10.470 --> 31:13.739
And you called me an empty
sack yourself once.

31:13.740 --> 31:15.479
No, no. No.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.619
I said your life was empty.

31:17.620 --> 31:19.379
Yes, I did.

31:19.380 --> 31:22.959
And Dante... Dante spoke
of the empty soul,

31:22.960 --> 31:24.709
not an empty sack.

31:24.710 --> 31:25.919
Same difference.

31:25.920 --> 31:29.471
You are so far from being an empty soul.

31:35.620 --> 31:38.319
You're really worried about her.

31:38.320 --> 31:39.640
Lou.

31:39.648 --> 31:41.730
She's fucked.

31:43.470 --> 31:44.819
My doing.

31:44.820 --> 31:46.864
Not everything is your doing.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.450
But this one is.

32:12.300 --> 32:14.370
Give it to me.

32:23.960 --> 32:26.160
Okay.

32:26.170 --> 32:29.615
We wait till everybody's out.

32:34.990 --> 32:36.539
What?

32:36.540 --> 32:38.373
Nothing.

32:42.090 --> 32:44.759
Okay, not nothing. Something.

32:44.760 --> 32:46.460
- Only I don't know what it is.
- Mom.

32:46.470 --> 32:48.659
You are not yourself these days.

32:48.660 --> 32:50.479
You come home, you go to your room,

32:50.480 --> 32:51.819
and you bury yourself in your books.

32:51.820 --> 32:53.279
What, So we've gone from,

32:53.280 --> 32:54.819
"Go upstairs and do your homework,"

32:54.820 --> 32:56.379
to, "Don't go upstairs
and do your homework"?

32:56.380 --> 32:58.119
Okay, don't you dare insult me.

32:58.120 --> 32:59.770
I am not stupid.

33:03.420 --> 33:05.479
Is it a girl?

33:05.480 --> 33:07.599
What?

33:07.600 --> 33:10.019
Teenage girls can wreak emotional havoc

33:10.020 --> 33:11.179
on teenage boys.

33:11.180 --> 33:12.729
- There's no girl, Mom.
- I was one.

33:12.730 --> 33:14.859
Sometimes teenage boys

33:14.860 --> 33:17.319
can get teenage girls pregnant.

33:17.320 --> 33:18.739
Mom, for God's sake.

33:18.740 --> 33:22.959
But mostly, teenage boys
tend to be carefree.

33:27.548 --> 33:29.879
Morning.

33:29.880 --> 33:31.549
You going to court?

33:31.550 --> 33:33.919
They say it's gonna happen today.

33:33.920 --> 33:38.440
No more of this... pretrial nonsense.

33:39.580 --> 33:41.099
No school?

33:41.100 --> 33:42.739
I'm about to leave.

33:42.740 --> 33:45.482
Just gotta finish this assignment.

33:48.820 --> 33:50.979
I don't know why you feel
the need to be there.

33:50.980 --> 33:52.979
Because I do, Marjorie.

33:52.980 --> 33:54.699
How many times are we gonna
have this conversation?

33:54.700 --> 33:56.199
I just...

33:56.200 --> 33:58.260
What?

34:00.080 --> 34:02.699
You're doing better.

34:02.700 --> 34:06.979
I... I see you trying,

34:06.980 --> 34:09.168
and you're doing better.

34:09.170 --> 34:13.199
I worry that all of this is gonna
stir all of that up again.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.760
I told you I'd make my way back.

34:19.420 --> 34:22.958
That's what I'm doing.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.329
This is...

34:24.330 --> 34:26.478
a part of that journey, I guess,

34:26.480 --> 34:29.692
but I have to be there.

34:29.693 --> 34:31.527
I don't understand the problem.

34:31.527 --> 34:32.839
The problem is,

34:32.840 --> 34:34.918
while most people couldn't get in here,

34:34.920 --> 34:36.438
special accommodations were made

34:36.440 --> 34:38.364
for victims of the jobs fair massacre.

34:38.364 --> 34:41.299
This room and the deck has
been emotionally stacked

34:41.300 --> 34:42.705
in favor of the defense.

34:42.706 --> 34:44.291
W-wait a second. Are you telling me

34:44.292 --> 34:45.560
that you can look out there

34:45.570 --> 34:48.958
and readily identify
victims of the jobs fair?

34:48.960 --> 34:51.018
I'm telling you what is, Your Honor,

34:51.020 --> 34:53.518
and contrary to the rumor,
juries are not stupid.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.135
They will read those faces.

34:55.136 --> 34:57.419
He will point to them like props,

34:57.420 --> 34:59.639
exploit the hatred
against Brady Hartsfield

34:59.640 --> 35:01.779
- to make the populist argument...
- Oh, wait, so you know my case now.

35:01.780 --> 35:04.311
I know you, and I have
a pretty good idea.

35:04.312 --> 35:07.319
The Sixth Amendment
guarantees the defendant

35:07.320 --> 35:08.979
the right to a public trial.

35:08.980 --> 35:11.568
- But you cannot cherry-pick...
- I didn't cherry-pick anybody.

35:11.569 --> 35:14.439
- All right.
- And the court has a duty

35:14.440 --> 35:17.139
to keep extraneous influences
out of the courtroom

35:17.140 --> 35:18.529
which may serve to contaminate

35:18.530 --> 35:20.910
- the process of justice, Your Honor.
- Brady Hartsfield ran down those people

35:20.911 --> 35:22.229
or members of their families...

35:22.230 --> 35:24.019
you call them extraneous?

35:24.020 --> 35:25.819
This is exactly what I'm talking about!

35:29.660 --> 35:31.419
Motion denied.

35:33.380 --> 35:35.466
I want my objection on the record.

35:35.467 --> 35:38.762
Of course you do. So noted.

35:40.080 --> 35:43.392
Bring in the defendant
first then the jury.

35:56.890 --> 35:59.460
She doesn't look good.

35:59.470 --> 36:02.035
No.

36:10.840 --> 36:13.719
Looks like Miss Piggy is
finally off to market.

36:15.470 --> 36:18.609
Why so nervous, Morris?
This is a simple B and E.

36:18.610 --> 36:19.619
Not like you'll need to be

36:19.620 --> 36:21.169
shooting somebody famous in the head.

36:21.170 --> 36:22.560
- You think you're funny?
- I'm just saying

36:22.570 --> 36:26.518
this is a piece of cake
and it's also right.

36:27.480 --> 36:28.679
- Right?
- Yes.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.919
Those books, if they're in there,

36:30.920 --> 36:33.389
are more rightly yours than theirs.

36:33.390 --> 36:34.639
It's called self-help,

36:34.640 --> 36:37.260
which is what the country
is comin' to anyway.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.239
We're influencers, you and me.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.742
I'll keep watch.

36:46.720 --> 36:48.490
We're on.

37:43.053 --> 37:45.304
You must be Boogers.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.432
You know who you remind me of, Boogers?

37:47.433 --> 37:50.349
John Rothstein.

37:50.350 --> 37:53.260
He snarled and growled
at me just like you.

37:53.270 --> 37:55.079
Only things didn't work
out too good for him.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.526
But I got a feeling that you and I,

37:58.527 --> 38:01.987
we're gonna get on much better.

38:01.988 --> 38:05.449
Oh, oh.

38:05.450 --> 38:08.139
Hey, hey.

38:08.140 --> 38:10.454
Now, I know you don't mean that.

38:10.455 --> 38:13.769
Okay, okay, I hear you.

38:13.770 --> 38:16.960
You're asking the most universal
question known to man...

38:16.980 --> 38:18.959
and maybe to dog as well.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.131
"What's in it for me?"

38:21.132 --> 38:22.649
You got principles you stand for.

38:22.650 --> 38:24.039
I want you to forsake those principles,

38:24.040 --> 38:28.499
so you're rightly asking,
"What's in it for me?"

38:28.500 --> 38:30.429
Oh!

38:34.470 --> 38:36.580
Hey...

38:41.180 --> 38:44.459
Your reward for choosing
to look the other way.

38:44.460 --> 38:45.949
Huh?

38:48.320 --> 38:51.309
Oh... ah.

38:51.310 --> 38:53.539
That's a good Boogers.

38:53.540 --> 38:56.640
Okay.

38:56.650 --> 38:58.420
Ms. Pace, we'll hear from you.

39:04.480 --> 39:07.259
A little over four years ago,

39:07.260 --> 39:12.260
Brady Hartsfield stole a Mercedes S 600

39:12.270 --> 39:16.940
and deliberately drove it
into a crowd of people.

39:16.950 --> 39:20.159
People who were standing
innocently in line

39:20.160 --> 39:22.479
to attend a jobs fair.

39:22.480 --> 39:27.119
People a bit... down on
their economic luck,

39:27.120 --> 39:30.319
hoping to turn a corner.

39:30.320 --> 39:34.999
They stood in line...

39:35.000 --> 39:36.916
daughters,

39:36.917 --> 39:39.793
mothers, boys,

39:39.794 --> 39:42.421
men,

39:42.422 --> 39:44.633
babies.

39:45.860 --> 39:48.299
Innocent people.

39:48.300 --> 39:50.888
And he mowed them down,

39:50.889 --> 39:53.098
maimed many more.

39:53.099 --> 39:56.518
We're still so stuck in that day.

39:56.519 --> 39:58.270
The police couldn't catch the monster,

39:58.271 --> 40:00.389
so we just lost hope.

40:00.390 --> 40:05.419
Evil had won out, so it seemed.

40:05.420 --> 40:08.519
But then we did get him...

40:08.520 --> 40:11.679
a foiled attempt to kill a hundred,

40:11.680 --> 40:15.939
maybe a thousand more at an arts gala.

40:15.940 --> 40:18.499
The monster was caught.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.439
He needed medical treatment,

40:20.440 --> 40:22.560
so we'd have to wait until he was healed

40:22.570 --> 40:25.215
before we put him on
trial, so we waited.

40:25.220 --> 40:28.719
And waited and waited and waited.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.886
Finally, the day came.

40:30.887 --> 40:35.389
We had Brady Hartsfield in a courtroom.

40:35.390 --> 40:36.979
The community of Bridgeton,

40:36.980 --> 40:40.104
the victims... stood poised

40:40.105 --> 40:42.769
to finally get the closure

40:42.770 --> 40:46.443
we were all so desperate for.

40:46.444 --> 40:50.406
Lou Linklatter, the defendant,

40:50.407 --> 40:53.409
she was in the courtroom that day

40:53.410 --> 40:57.409
giving testimony against Brady.

40:57.410 --> 40:59.199
But as the evidence will show,

40:59.200 --> 41:01.240
she was not about to concern herself

41:01.250 --> 41:03.179
with anyone's need for closure.

41:03.180 --> 41:05.421
She was not here for law and order.

41:05.422 --> 41:07.923
She was here for revenge.

41:07.924 --> 41:10.050
And vengeance she got.

41:10.051 --> 41:13.804
She pulled out a 3-D printed gun

41:13.805 --> 41:16.429
which she herself made,

41:16.430 --> 41:21.840
walked right up to him calmly...

41:21.850 --> 41:24.599
said, "I do not forgive you,"

41:24.600 --> 41:27.610
and she then blew out Brady
Hartsfield's brains.

41:29.100 --> 41:31.230
Witnesses... you will hear from some...

41:31.239 --> 41:34.241
say that as Brady lay there,

41:34.242 --> 41:37.930
he looked almost at peace.

41:39.831 --> 41:43.070
A smile, even, on his face.

41:44.620 --> 41:49.460
Maybe he sensed he'd won in a way.

41:49.490 --> 41:53.199
No prison. No suffering.

41:53.200 --> 41:56.779
No facing the wrath of
those he so devastated.

41:56.780 --> 41:58.719
He was spared.

41:58.720 --> 42:01.679
Spared a trial, spared prison time,

42:01.680 --> 42:03.699
spared having to face down

42:03.700 --> 42:06.040
the pain of all his victims.

42:06.050 --> 42:07.769
She spared him.

42:07.770 --> 42:13.129
People who waited so long
to address the monster

42:13.130 --> 42:17.019
and make him see, make him
feel their anguish...

42:17.020 --> 42:18.202
they didn't get that.

42:18.203 --> 42:21.080
She took that from them.

42:21.081 --> 42:23.791
She took the law in her own hands

42:23.792 --> 42:26.649
and committed premeditated murder.

42:26.650 --> 42:28.421
That is not in dispute.

42:29.680 --> 42:33.340
Now, we know who and what

42:33.343 --> 42:36.011
Brady Hartsfield was,

42:36.012 --> 42:38.889
and we know who the defendant is...

42:38.890 --> 42:41.539
a victim of Brady's

42:41.540 --> 42:44.895
who let herself be
overtaken by her rage.

42:44.896 --> 42:49.024
And we know what the law is, don't we?

42:49.025 --> 42:51.159
Now, if you really think about it,

42:51.160 --> 42:53.439
the only thing we don't know here is...

42:53.440 --> 42:57.200
which this trial will
ultimately decide...

42:58.620 --> 43:02.870
is who are you?

43:44.340 --> 43:45.579
Fuck!

43:48.520 --> 43:52.239
What the district attorney left out...

43:52.240 --> 43:56.119
Brady Hartsfield wasn't in
court that day to stand trial

43:56.120 --> 43:57.779
for his sins.

43:57.780 --> 43:59.669
It was a competency hearing

43:59.670 --> 44:02.919
where Brady was seeking to avoid

44:02.920 --> 44:06.469
being held accountable,
and as that was going on,

44:06.470 --> 44:10.239
the federal government had
issued a habeas corpus motion

44:10.240 --> 44:12.179
to take control of him

44:12.180 --> 44:16.199
so that they could put
Mr. Mercedes in a hospital,

44:16.200 --> 44:20.640
study him to help chart medical
progress on the brain.

44:20.650 --> 44:24.179
Brady Hartsfield wasn't
destined for prison

44:24.180 --> 44:25.779
or the death penalty.

44:25.780 --> 44:28.119
He was headed for "60 Minutes."

44:28.120 --> 44:30.419
He was going to be celebrated,

44:30.420 --> 44:35.629
a poster boy for the
miracles of modern medicine.

44:35.630 --> 44:38.179
Ms. Pace talks about closure.

44:38.180 --> 44:40.909
Honestly, I don't even
know what that means...

44:40.910 --> 44:43.899
vindication, revenge, getting even?

44:43.900 --> 44:45.470
What's closure?

44:45.475 --> 44:47.149
My best guess,

44:47.150 --> 44:51.660
it's this feeling of
settling the score somehow.

44:53.660 --> 44:57.719
Lou Linklatter settled a score,

44:57.720 --> 45:03.283
one that this justice system
was not willing to address.

45:03.284 --> 45:05.869
Put him in a cushy hospital room.

45:05.870 --> 45:07.199
Give him three squares.

45:07.200 --> 45:11.160
Let him help doctors win peace prizes?

45:11.170 --> 45:12.879
That is not the score

45:12.880 --> 45:16.049
the victims of the jobs
massacre had in mind.

45:16.050 --> 45:17.840
It is most certainly not closure!

45:18.840 --> 45:21.829
Ms. Pace wants to prioritize

45:21.830 --> 45:24.260
Brady's victims today,

45:24.270 --> 45:27.475
make sure their needs are met.

45:28.920 --> 45:33.180
Who do you think gave them
what they crave most?

45:33.189 --> 45:36.109
The judicial process?

45:38.100 --> 45:39.770
Or Lou Linklatter.

45:46.560 --> 45:48.460
Nothin' at all?

45:48.470 --> 45:49.959
I looked everywhere.

45:49.960 --> 45:51.699
Well, then they stashed
them someplace else.

45:51.700 --> 45:53.876
- Maybe it's not him.
- It's him.

45:53.877 --> 45:56.789
And it's time for plan B.

45:58.548 --> 46:01.214
The room felt like it might
explode. I kid you not.

46:01.215 --> 46:03.179
I think the presence of the victims,

46:03.180 --> 46:06.638
the anger, the anguish...
it was all so charged.

46:06.639 --> 46:09.016
It's as if Mr. Mercedes

46:09.017 --> 46:11.349
is not gone, not even close.

46:11.350 --> 46:12.699
Everyone in the room.

46:12.700 --> 46:15.479
Brady Hartsfield has not let go.

46:15.480 --> 46:19.519
He's gonna be the final
legacy of this town.

46:19.520 --> 46:22.079
No.

46:22.080 --> 46:25.908
Our legacy will be that
we killed John Rothstein.

46:27.220 --> 46:30.899
I spoke to the doctor who
worked on the John Doe patient.

46:30.900 --> 46:34.729
Says he went by Mike Lee as his name.

46:34.730 --> 46:37.539
Okay.

46:37.540 --> 46:40.799
Yeah, I think...
you might be onto something

46:40.800 --> 46:42.299
with that theory of yours.

46:42.300 --> 46:44.099
The guy Stan the Man
delivered to the hospital

46:44.100 --> 46:47.597
was probably the person
that killed Rothstein.

46:54.580 --> 46:56.679
So, uh...

46:56.680 --> 46:59.274
how'd it go in court today, good or...

46:59.275 --> 47:00.899
Uh...

47:00.900 --> 47:02.859
It's hard to say.

47:02.860 --> 47:04.488
Both lawyers were good.

47:04.489 --> 47:06.029
Very good, but...

47:06.030 --> 47:08.779
How did Lou seem?

47:08.780 --> 47:10.759
Well, mm...

47:10.760 --> 47:13.300
Less good.

47:15.290 --> 47:17.319
It went okay, I think.

47:17.320 --> 47:19.699
It's probably a wash.
How'd you feel about it?

47:19.700 --> 47:21.710
Good.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.439
Lou, don't take this personally, but...

47:27.440 --> 47:29.259
that rocking you're doing right now,

47:29.260 --> 47:31.432
you were doing that some in court today.

47:31.433 --> 47:35.978
It calms me.

47:37.580 --> 47:39.959
I understand.

47:39.960 --> 47:44.821
But, uh... it makes you
look unhinged, so...

47:46.070 --> 47:49.059
Not that that's terrible,

47:49.060 --> 47:51.869
since the crux of
involuntary manslaughter

47:51.870 --> 47:54.159
is, it just kinda happened.

47:54.160 --> 47:56.279
You didn't plan it out so much as...

47:56.280 --> 47:58.167
It just happened?

48:00.260 --> 48:03.039
Here's the deal: you looking
a little off is good.

48:03.040 --> 48:05.258
It mitigates against culpable intent.

48:05.259 --> 48:09.839
But... if you seem too off,

48:09.840 --> 48:11.979
for you to be back out on the street,

48:11.980 --> 48:13.979
the jury's gotta want you
back out on the street,

48:13.980 --> 48:17.959
and if you come off as scary,

48:17.960 --> 48:19.880
they won't want that.

48:24.720 --> 48:26.770
I wanna call Holly.

48:26.779 --> 48:29.073
Holly Gibney?

48:31.100 --> 48:36.979
I want you to call her as a witness.

48:36.980 --> 48:39.500
Because?

48:40.820 --> 48:43.540
She's one of Brady's victims too.

48:44.720 --> 48:48.049
Brady blew up her aunt.

48:48.050 --> 48:52.359
She... bashed his head in,

48:52.360 --> 48:55.240
put him in the coma.

48:57.760 --> 49:01.359
I think she'd make a riveting witness.

49:01.360 --> 49:03.524
- Even so...
- I'm not finished.

49:07.130 --> 49:12.540
She could be a de facto surrogate.

49:12.560 --> 49:15.499
She took matters into her
own hands, like I did.

49:15.500 --> 49:19.099
She let Brady have it, like I did.

49:19.100 --> 49:22.479
Only, she's pretty

49:22.480 --> 49:24.459
and not a lesbian.

49:24.460 --> 49:28.299
The jury, they'll relate
to her, they'll...

49:28.300 --> 49:31.169
they're gonna root for Holly Gibney!

49:31.170 --> 49:35.560
'Cause she's sympathetic
and relatable and...

49:35.580 --> 49:39.079
she's likeable.

49:39.080 --> 49:40.680
Like me. Ha.

49:42.160 --> 49:44.879
You make the jury fall in
love with Holly Gibney,

49:44.880 --> 49:48.519
which I'm sure you can
easily accomplish, Roland,

49:48.520 --> 49:52.619
and then you turn to me and you go,

49:52.620 --> 49:56.739
"Look. She's just like Holly."

49:56.740 --> 50:01.039
And the best... the best
part about this is,

50:01.040 --> 50:03.760
Pace's blather about how the victims,

50:03.770 --> 50:05.399
they didn't get their due,

50:05.400 --> 50:08.219
they didn't get to go toe-to-toe
with Brady Hartsfield...

50:08.220 --> 50:13.519
Well, Holly... she's one of them.

50:13.520 --> 50:17.059
She got to go toe-to-toe with Brady.

50:17.060 --> 50:19.308
And she bashed his head in.

50:20.900 --> 50:24.250
There's your fuckin' closure.

50:25.120 --> 50:27.479
If you like Holly,

50:27.480 --> 50:29.379
mm...

50:29.380 --> 50:31.778
wait till you see Lou.

50:31.779 --> 50:34.865
Oh, my God.

50:36.460 --> 50:38.599
Oh!

50:38.600 --> 50:41.080
Diamond in the rough, right?

50:42.700 --> 50:44.289
I'm sorry?

50:44.290 --> 50:46.139
Holly.

50:46.140 --> 50:48.810
Diamond in the rough.

50:50.100 --> 50:54.130
Like that... Neil Diamond song.

50:58.120 --> 50:59.219
Lou.

50:59.220 --> 51:01.239
Oh, my mother.

51:01.240 --> 51:04.379
God, she loved that song.

51:04.380 --> 51:06.759
Not that she wasn't the worst...

51:06.760 --> 51:08.441
mother in the world.

51:13.770 --> 51:15.839
I'm gonna...

51:15.840 --> 51:17.320
Think all this over.
