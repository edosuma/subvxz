00:59.517 --> 01:00.351
Hey.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.270
My life is over.

01:04.813 --> 01:05.815
Don't say that.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.234
It's true.

01:09.277 --> 01:10.528
I'm dead either way.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.699
If I kill Latrelle, I'll be dead inside.

01:17.577 --> 01:18.745
If I don't kill him...

01:20.455 --> 01:21.664
I'll just be dead.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.586
What if you disappear?

01:28.421 --> 01:29.464
How?

01:30.006 --> 01:31.007
With money.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.343
A lot of money.

01:36.513 --> 01:40.517
Twenty, seven, 42.

01:41.851 --> 01:45.021
Twenty, seven, 42.

01:46.481 --> 01:49.859
Twenty, seven, 42.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.028
Do me right
and make my dreams come true.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.248
You're heartless!

02:05.834 --> 02:07.836
Come on, boo. You know I love you.

02:09.336 --> 02:11.172
Those other boxes didn't mean a thing.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.299
You're the real deal.

02:17.011 --> 02:18.471
Am I interrupting something?

02:21.057 --> 02:22.475
- Where've you been?
- I'm sorry.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.894
I didn't see any of your messages
until this morning.

02:24.978 --> 02:25.812
What's all this?

02:27.647 --> 02:29.482
This is what Ricky left Chivo.

02:29.566 --> 02:32.527
It holds the answers to RollerWorld.
I know it does.

02:32.610 --> 02:35.613
That combo right there opened every box
and still nothing.

02:35.697 --> 02:39.033
I've been searching all night and nothing.
Still nothing!

02:39.117 --> 02:41.161
And there are dozens of boxes left to go.

02:41.828 --> 02:42.996
I think I have arthritis.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.081
Would it be juvenile arthritis?

02:45.623 --> 02:47.250
Am I still a juvenile?

02:47.333 --> 02:48.209
Let me help you.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.631
Woman, please! There's an order to this.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.009
Bottom to top, left to right.

03:02.140 --> 03:02.974
I hate you.

03:03.057 --> 03:04.642
Let me see what you got.

03:05.476 --> 03:08.313
What are you guys doing?
This is trespassing.

03:10.940 --> 03:11.816
Um...

03:11.900 --> 03:13.651
Is there anything you want to tell us?

03:14.319 --> 03:15.153
About what?

03:15.904 --> 03:16.946
That whole thing?

03:17.030 --> 03:20.408
I was helping Olivia with a makeup test
for her quince when Jamal 911ed.

03:20.491 --> 03:22.619
Right side's glamour, left side's chic.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.787
Dude, I can't believe I'm saying this,
but...

03:25.914 --> 03:27.123
you're beautiful!

03:27.206 --> 03:28.333
Why is he here?

03:28.416 --> 03:32.795
Because someone wasn't answering
my calls and texts.

03:32.879 --> 03:36.424
My phone was dead and I'm here now
and that's all that matters.

03:36.507 --> 03:38.301
I think the naysayer needs to go home.

03:38.384 --> 03:41.554
I am not a naysayer.
And why do I need to go home?

03:42.138 --> 03:43.681
- RollerWorld.
- I'm out of here.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.350
RollerWorld is real!

03:48.603 --> 03:50.855
So were the chupacabra bones
you found in sixth grade.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.191
- It's the only way to save Cesar.
- Save Cesar?

03:53.274 --> 03:55.026
Before he's forced to kill Latrelle.

03:55.109 --> 03:57.237
Per usual, you're overreacting.

03:57.695 --> 03:58.905
He's got a gun.

03:58.988 --> 04:01.407
And he has to do it tonight
unless he disappears.

04:02.575 --> 04:06.287
This is crazy. If he's got a gun,
then why don't we help him now?

04:06.371 --> 04:07.747
Why can't he disappear now?

04:07.830 --> 04:09.207
- To where?
- Anywhere.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.583
That's not a plan.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.001
This is the plan.

04:13.169 --> 04:14.921
The guy who jacked RollerWorld
left this behind.

04:15.004 --> 04:16.214
It's a clue to where the money is.

04:16.297 --> 04:18.298
- Ring around the Rosie?
- No!

04:18.382 --> 04:19.676
The numbers up top.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.636
They opened a combo,
then we found these numbers.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.721
Now we have to figure out
what the new numbers mean.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.641
This is ridiculous.
Do you hear yourselves?

04:26.724 --> 04:27.934
Numbers leading to more numbers

04:28.017 --> 04:30.186
leading to money
that definitely doesn't exist.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.438
And if it did, somebody
would've found it by now.

04:32.522 --> 04:35.400
Or not. It's our only chance
at saving Cesar.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.610
I just put the numbers in my phone.

04:37.694 --> 04:41.197
They're either lottery numbers
or extremely unique body measurements.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.782
Well, only one is a prime number.

04:43.574 --> 04:46.494
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. I'm just stating a fact.

04:46.577 --> 04:47.996
I don't have a math degree.

04:48.454 --> 04:49.455
Degrees!

04:50.873 --> 04:52.125
These are coordinates.

05:05.179 --> 05:08.641
- So what are we looking for?
- Anything and everything that jumps out.

05:08.725 --> 05:09.851
Anything that marks the spot.

05:09.934 --> 05:11.728
Maybe something
that could be from the '80s

05:11.811 --> 05:13.313
after they pulled off the heist?

05:15.231 --> 05:17.150
- I'll take the playground.
- I'll take the handball court.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.902
And I'll babysit the bikes
and Google cheap bus tickets.

05:20.737 --> 05:24.282
Sorry, I'm still not buying
into RollerWorld. You're all crazy.

05:24.365 --> 05:26.617
And you look crazy.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.953
Might want to wipe your face.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.172
Sorry.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.135
Ooh.

05:44.218 --> 05:46.012
Mira. Hey, what's up?

05:56.898 --> 05:57.774
I got a hit!

06:03.571 --> 06:06.616
I'm just gonna wipe my prints off
and put this right back.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.289
- I didn't find anything.
- Me either.

06:13.372 --> 06:15.374
We might have enough
to get Cesar to Fresno.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.293
- Then what? He lives on the streets?
- No.

06:17.376 --> 06:19.295
The Central Valley produces
more than just meth.

06:19.378 --> 06:21.380
Fresno's actually a bustling
agricultural community.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.133
There's a plethora of opportunity for him.
See?

06:24.217 --> 06:25.343
Wait. Get up.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.178
No, I'm telling you, Fresno's the answer.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.847
If he doesn't want to pick fruit,
there's canning, curing, drying,

06:29.931 --> 06:31.974
and the largest turkey farm...

06:35.812 --> 06:36.813
That's it.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.024
The game's afoot.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.652
- Sherlock Holmes.
- Oh.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.695
That makes total sense.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.698
'Cause cholos love Sherlock Holmes,
homes.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.994
Doy 823.8.

06:53.162 --> 06:54.455
Doy 823.8.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.958
Doy. Doy. Doy.

06:57.041 --> 06:59.961
Doyle! Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.671
It's the Dewey decimal system.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.842
I'm a survivalist.
Got to know your Deweys.

07:06.801 --> 07:07.969
The library. Let's go!

07:24.819 --> 07:25.862
Oh, great.

07:26.821 --> 07:27.822
Oh, it's heavy.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.492
Okay. All right.

07:38.916 --> 07:39.959
I found the tip!

07:42.378 --> 07:43.796
And the balls and the shaft.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.467
- We don't have time for dick jokes.
- There's always time for dick jokes.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.052
Cesar needs us. Stop dicking around.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.180
You do know
that was another dick joke, right?

07:56.058 --> 07:57.894
How do we know what we're searching for?

07:57.977 --> 07:59.145
You'll know when you know.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.515
Look at what I got here.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.951
Okay, so we've got four elements.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.036
- What can we make with them?
- Uh...

08:57.119 --> 08:58.037
A bomb.

08:58.579 --> 09:01.249
To cause a distraction
to get Cesar the hell out of here.

09:01.332 --> 09:04.919
Promethium, Phosphorus, Lanthium, Neon.

09:06.128 --> 09:07.129
It's a compound.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.341
Or it spells something out.

09:10.424 --> 09:12.885
PM plane.

09:13.761 --> 09:14.595
Night plane?

09:15.471 --> 09:17.306
The Midnight Plane to Georgia.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.809
- It's Midnight Train.
- And PM is noon, not midnight.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.435
Midnight Plane to Georgia?

09:21.894 --> 09:23.604
Your black card
should be revoked for that.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.147
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.900
Halves cannot revoke
the black cards of wholes.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.528
- Says who?
- All of me.

09:30.611 --> 09:31.529
It's Pimp Lane.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.114
It's Pimp Lane!

09:33.739 --> 09:37.076
And only a local would know that.
Holy shit! This is real!

09:37.159 --> 09:39.579
We got to go! We got to go!
It's Pimp Lane!

09:39.662 --> 09:41.372
Oh, the game's afoot, bitches!

10:18.743 --> 10:20.911
It's Olivia.
She's been blowing me up all day.

10:20.995 --> 10:21.912
So, answer it.

10:21.996 --> 10:24.999
And tell her what happened with Cesar?
No way I'm telling her about us.

10:25.082 --> 10:27.376
Us? She's calling about Cesar.

10:27.918 --> 10:31.297
Yeah. Right. You know what I mean.
I don't want her to worry. Here.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.674
This is your phone.
I don't want in on this drama.

10:34.383 --> 10:35.426
It's Olivia. Answer it.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.428
Oh, hell no!

10:37.511 --> 10:39.221
That's like giving Oxy to a junkie.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.893
Hey! What's up?

10:43.976 --> 10:46.312
Hey. I'm really worried about Cesar.

10:46.395 --> 10:49.482
He's not picking up his phone.
I went by his house, he's not there.

10:49.565 --> 10:51.942
- Is he with you?
- Me? No, why would he be with me?

10:52.026 --> 10:54.862
I'm hanging with Ruby and Jamal.
Ruby is dying to talk to you.

10:56.030 --> 10:56.864
Hey.

10:56.947 --> 10:57.865
What's going on?

10:57.948 --> 10:58.991
Uh...

10:59.075 --> 11:01.452
We're working on a surprise
for your quince.

11:01.535 --> 11:03.954
- Monse wants the phone back.
- No. I don't want it.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.958
Yeah, it's a real elaborate surprise.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.585
Lots of twists and turns.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.795
Can I call you later?

11:10.878 --> 11:14.173
Sure. If you see Cesar,
can you please tell him to call me?

11:14.256 --> 11:15.257
Yeah, no prob.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.093
I'll do that. Bye.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.094
Bye.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.648
What are you doing?

11:31.148 --> 11:33.859
We're trying to figure out
if that's a boob or a butt.

11:35.277 --> 11:36.112
A boob.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.447
Can we get back to saving our friend?

11:45.246 --> 11:46.163
Nothing.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.332
There's nothing.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.877
Except a lot of STDs.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.963
That's why I didn't pull out
the black light.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.048
We must have missed something.

11:56.632 --> 11:59.051
So... you want the black light?

11:59.135 --> 12:02.430
No, no. I'm talking about the elements.
We must've messed up the name.

12:02.513 --> 12:03.764
It's not Pimp Lane.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.474
But it's got to be Pimp Lane.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.727
- Oh, I wouldn't sit there.
- Maybe we should go back to the library.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.147
- It's closed.
- What do you mean it's closed?

12:11.230 --> 12:12.648
As in not open. It's closed.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.525
- Hey... it's a path!
- Why do you do this?

12:14.608 --> 12:16.861
Every time I have an idea,
if it didn't come from you, you just go...

12:16.944 --> 12:18.654
What do you want me to do?
Open the library?

12:18.737 --> 12:21.490
You're insufferable. First you're
a non-believer, now you know everything?

12:21.574 --> 12:25.703
Look, I'm right because I'm right.

12:25.786 --> 12:26.704
Don't be a hater.

12:27.371 --> 12:28.747
I found something!

12:37.923 --> 12:40.926
That's a Santos cross.
But what does it say above it?

12:41.010 --> 12:42.845
"En las sombras del tiempo."

12:43.471 --> 12:44.889
In the shadows of time.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.766
Yeah, but what's six, four, seven, nine?

12:48.809 --> 12:50.269
It's a sundial.

12:50.352 --> 12:51.937
Chivo said Lil' Ricky loved them.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.482
What do we do with it? There's no sun.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.609
Ha.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.861
Watch and learn, my crab-infested friends.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.322
Okay, so first, we take out a pen.

13:01.405 --> 13:03.157
Then we need a light to be the sun.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.910
So, a sundial is like a clock.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.662
So, if I position my light
over the numbers,

13:08.746 --> 13:10.915
it'll cast a shadow onto the letter...

13:10.998 --> 13:13.584
Enough! Just do it.

13:13.667 --> 13:16.462
Okay, you need to learn this
in case of the apocalypse.

13:16.795 --> 13:17.630
What?

13:17.713 --> 13:21.091
I'm gonna follow the numbers
to get a letter. Here we go.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.886
Six o'clock: P.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.639
Four: O.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.558
Seven: O.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.852
Nine: I.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.229
Pool.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.147
The money's at the pool.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.733
But where's a pool?

13:38.776 --> 13:40.486
- The community pool!
- The community pool!

13:40.945 --> 13:44.823
Lil' Ricky, you can suck it,
because nothing gets past us!

13:45.658 --> 13:46.534
Our bikes!

13:51.830 --> 13:52.873
What the hell?

13:53.874 --> 13:57.253
Rookies? What, were you guys raised
in the 'burbs or something?

13:57.336 --> 14:00.172
- Lock it or lose it.
- Read the room, Jamal.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.966
How are we gonna get around now?

14:09.598 --> 14:11.642
What are you doing at Pimp Lane?

14:11.892 --> 14:12.726
Um...

14:12.810 --> 14:14.853
How do you know about Pimp Lane?

14:15.896 --> 14:18.941
Mijo, I wasn't always old.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.986
I was once, what they call, a sure thing.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.948
- I think I'm gonna throw up.
- Don't slut shame me.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.242
Abuelita, we got to get
to the community pool.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.286
- ¿Por qué?
- We'll tell you on the way.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.287
Ah.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.552
Look how fast those fools
are drinking that lean.

14:47.344 --> 14:48.554
They'll be faded soon.

14:49.638 --> 14:50.723
Then you strike.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.516
Too many ojos.

14:53.475 --> 14:56.020
So what? Who cares who's watching?

14:58.314 --> 14:59.315
I do.

15:00.149 --> 15:02.026
And so would Spooky. We sit tight.

15:02.985 --> 15:03.944
All right.

15:20.586 --> 15:21.837
Jamal, what are you doing?

15:21.921 --> 15:22.838
Look out!

15:31.096 --> 15:33.015
Jamal, why are you soaking wet?

15:33.724 --> 15:36.352
I don't want to talk about it.
What just happened ain't right.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.646
What's not right is
there's no Santos Cross here.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.272
Every clue had a cross on it.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.316
Google says there's 19
more pools in Freeridge.

15:42.399 --> 15:46.070
Okay, so Jamal, you change
into the clothes I have in the back

15:46.153 --> 15:47.613
and we'll check all the pools.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.740
No. I'm doomed.
We're doomed. Cesar's doomed.

15:49.823 --> 15:52.201
I haven't slept in days.
Julio's dead, and poor Juanita.

15:52.284 --> 15:55.120
We're not doomed if we solve this,
so stop being so dramatic.

15:56.705 --> 15:58.666
- I am being dramatic.
- We know.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.543
Like Nicolas Cage dramatic.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.004
Odd reference, but yeah, so quit it.

16:04.088 --> 16:08.300
I'm so dramatic that I tried out
for the local production of Rent.

16:08.717 --> 16:11.261
- That was a rip off of La Bohème.
- Whatever.

16:11.345 --> 16:16.100
My point is I tried out
at the Robert Pool Theater.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.312
The P-O-O-L Theater.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.235
- It's a pool in the title.
- Oh.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.113
Out!

16:29.822 --> 16:33.701
Out damned spot! Out, I say!

16:34.410 --> 16:35.786
One, two.

16:36.286 --> 16:39.248
Why, then, 'tis time to do 't.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.166
Hell is murky!

16:41.583 --> 16:43.836
Fie, my lord, fie!

16:43.919 --> 16:46.505
- There's nothing here.
- Keep looking.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.757
I think this might be a dead end too.

16:48.841 --> 16:52.720
...we fear who knows it,
when none can call our power to account?

16:52.803 --> 16:55.180
Yet who would have thought the old man...

16:55.264 --> 16:56.974
Hear ye, hear ye.

16:57.850 --> 17:02.438
Hast thou observeth
a crucifix of yonder year?

17:03.397 --> 17:06.191
Circa the year of our lord 1980?

17:07.108 --> 17:08.152
What?

17:08.902 --> 17:10.779
Have any of you seen a cross?

17:11.488 --> 17:14.950
There's a cross in the wings that
we touch before each show for good luck.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.577
Been there forever.

17:18.619 --> 17:20.539
"Find your center."

17:20.622 --> 17:22.124
This doesn't make any sense.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.756
Okay, so we started at the park...

17:29.298 --> 17:31.842
and then we went to the library...

17:32.342 --> 17:34.011
and then we went to Pimp Lane...

17:35.220 --> 17:36.680
and then finally we came here.

17:36.764 --> 17:37.931
And get dick.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.142
Technically that happened at the library.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.518
Ta-da!

17:46.565 --> 17:47.858
What is this?

17:47.941 --> 17:50.069
This is finding your center.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.154
The park.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.200
The library.

17:59.912 --> 18:00.871
Pimp Lane.

18:02.831 --> 18:03.749
And now...

18:08.003 --> 18:09.046
here.

18:09.129 --> 18:10.923
Four points.

18:14.593 --> 18:15.761
It's a cross.

18:23.936 --> 18:24.812
Huh?

18:26.188 --> 18:28.065
Now I really don't know
what you're talking about.

18:28.148 --> 18:29.483
That makes three of us.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.569
Do you know what's
in the center of these four points?

18:36.782 --> 18:39.910
A place with muchos santos.

18:39.993 --> 18:41.662
Oh.

18:51.463 --> 18:54.133
Stop praying. It's time.

18:54.716 --> 18:56.176
Still too many people.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.553
They'll hear it for sure.

18:57.928 --> 19:00.347
Nah. Not when you got this.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.685
Fool been crushing the lean all night.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.479
So when he goes to take a piss,

19:08.105 --> 19:09.148
you make your move.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.066
God help me.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.279
Are you praying for Cesar?

19:16.488 --> 19:17.322
No.

19:18.615 --> 19:19.616
For Sylvia.

19:20.450 --> 19:21.577
Who's Sylvia?

19:21.660 --> 19:22.911
Fernando's wife.

19:24.163 --> 19:28.417
He poisoned her and her twin sister
after he woke up from his coma.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.085
That's horrible.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.337
She's talking about her telenovela.
Let's go.

19:38.427 --> 19:39.344
Not here.

19:39.928 --> 19:40.846
Not here.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.139
It's not here.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.824
Is it just me or is that baby Jesus
throwing a gang sign?

20:03.744 --> 20:05.037
He's repping the Santos!

20:19.843 --> 20:21.094
There's nothing here!

20:31.855 --> 20:33.649
- Monse, help me with this.
- Okay.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.901
Hey! Have some respect.

20:50.374 --> 20:51.917
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

20:53.085 --> 20:54.711
This isn't just an altar.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.421
It's a magic box.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.423
Like Ms. Uyeshiro's box.
Don't you remember her box?

20:59.508 --> 21:00.926
Come on, man, grow up!

21:01.009 --> 21:02.970
But don't you remember her box
in the fourth grade?

21:03.053 --> 21:06.098
It was like this intriguing,
impenetrable cypher.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.850
- Dude, we don't have time for that!
- Okay.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.645
Oh, so we got time for dick jokes,
but not box jokes?

21:13.522 --> 21:14.356
You heard that?

21:15.649 --> 21:17.067
- You heard that?
- Yeah.

21:17.150 --> 21:18.527
Hey, Jamal, help me.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.863
Here! Here! Here! Lift it. Lift it.

21:30.122 --> 21:33.000
Hey, Nah. Hey, I'm about to go piss.

21:37.379 --> 21:38.714
It's time, Lil' Spooky.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.188
I'm faded, man.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.524
This lean is something serious.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.122
What the what?

22:12.205 --> 22:15.125
I told you it was real.
We just saved Cesar!

22:16.335 --> 22:17.586
We just saved Cesar!

22:19.629 --> 22:22.549
This is surreal. We need to memorialize
the moment and send it to Cesar.

22:22.632 --> 22:23.508
Okay, right.

22:31.850 --> 22:32.684
It's chocolate.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.102
Hell, yeah, we got chocolate!

22:34.186 --> 22:37.689
We can buy chocolate, vanilla,
that new Tesla with the gull wings.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.608
No, the gold.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.610
It's not gold, it's chocolate.

22:46.156 --> 22:47.991
Maybe it's only chocolate on the top.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.041
Chivo.

23:00.712 --> 23:01.713
It's Cesar.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.638
- Hey.
- I got no more time. What do you got?

23:11.264 --> 23:12.641
Um...

23:12.724 --> 23:13.642
Nothing.

23:16.269 --> 23:17.479
I'm so sorry.

23:19.815 --> 23:20.690
Cesar?

23:21.691 --> 23:22.526
Cesar?

23:23.610 --> 23:24.694
Cesar, say something.

23:32.619 --> 23:33.578
Oh, my God.

23:34.746 --> 23:35.705
Oh, my God.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.042
You better pray he's okay.

23:39.126 --> 23:42.087
- We'll get the money, and he'll be safe.
- We could've had him out of town by now!

23:43.004 --> 23:44.714
This is just a mislead.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.758
A red herring. A MacGuffin.
Tell her, Ruby.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.010
I told you
we should've just put him on a bus.

23:49.094 --> 23:52.973
He needs money to get away.
RollerWorld is that money.

23:53.056 --> 23:54.432
- We just got to...
- Got to what?

23:54.516 --> 23:56.393
You live in a fantasy. Grow up, Jamal.

23:56.476 --> 23:59.020
You just ruined Cesar's life.
He's never gonna be the same.

24:00.438 --> 24:04.109
I didn't ruin his life.
He ruined his own life.

24:04.192 --> 24:06.486
Cesar's in a gang! Okay?

24:06.570 --> 24:08.029
That's the reality, all right?

24:08.113 --> 24:09.739
And you think I'm living in a fantasy?

24:10.240 --> 24:13.201
You're the one who's living in a fantasy
thinking you can save Cesar.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.996
It's not going to happen. Ever!

24:16.079 --> 24:19.166
Cesar was born a Santo,
he's gonna die a Santo.

24:19.249 --> 24:21.126
So stop lying to yourself, sweetie.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.254
I'm lying to myself?

24:26.882 --> 24:29.509
Your whole life is a lie.
Those fake-ass injuries.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.595
Bullshitting your parents.
The football team.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.723
You're the biggest, fakest liar ever.
I hope I never see you again.

24:34.806 --> 24:37.017
- And you never will.
- Jamal, Monse, chill!

24:37.100 --> 24:39.394
No! I'm sick and tired of chilling.

24:39.477 --> 24:42.856
And I'm sick and tired of y'all telling me
that it's always my fault.

24:42.939 --> 24:45.066
So you can miss me with that crap.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.067
Get over here!

24:46.151 --> 24:47.485
Hey, hey, hey. ¡No más!

24:57.746 --> 24:59.164
I can't believe I got played.

25:00.540 --> 25:03.126
There has to be a way.
RollerWorld has to be true.

25:04.419 --> 25:07.005
Jamal, for what it's worth,

25:08.006 --> 25:09.174
I believed it too.

25:10.342 --> 25:14.638
But... some mysteries
aren't meant to be solved.

25:28.818 --> 25:29.736
Abuelita...

25:35.408 --> 25:36.493
tell Olivia...

25:38.161 --> 25:39.454
I can't make her quince.

25:46.503 --> 25:48.421
Come on. Please, man. Please.

25:48.505 --> 25:50.632
Don't do this, man. Don't do this.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.008
We went to school together.

25:52.092 --> 25:53.593
And you still pulled a gun on me.

25:54.427 --> 25:57.138
I didn't shoot, man. But I didn't shoot.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.307
You should've.
