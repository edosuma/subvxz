WEBVTT

00:01.434 --> 00:02.701
(quacking)

00:04.204 --> 00:06.472
BOONIE:
Hey, hey, is God mad at us?

00:06.474 --> 00:07.539
Of course not, man.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.441
Why would Pops be mad?

00:09.443 --> 00:11.143
Look, he blessed us
with this beautiful day.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.778
We out here chillin'.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.179
You got a pocketful
of weed.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.715
And we're about
to catch some free dinner.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.784
Did I mention that it was "free"
and it was "dinner"?

00:18.786 --> 00:20.052
Why would he be mad at us?

00:20.054 --> 00:21.353
'Cause I'm fishing for dinner

00:21.355 --> 00:22.688
in Wilt Chamberlain Lake.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.723
I mean, I don't mind
the free food,

00:24.725 --> 00:26.225
but this is embarrassing.

00:26.227 --> 00:29.228
I don't want to be seen
doing this crap.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.462
TRAYVON: Guys, this
is a terrible idea.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.197
We should not be
eating this fish.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.500
Oh, here you go
with that bullshit, man.

00:34.502 --> 00:36.301
What, you reading
some dumb shit online

00:36.303 --> 00:38.037
about the fish in the hood bad?

00:38.039 --> 00:39.304
I was reading the
California Office

00:39.306 --> 00:40.973
of Environmental
Hazard Assessment

00:40.975 --> 00:42.641
June 2010 report

00:42.643 --> 00:44.009
titled "Health Advisory

00:44.011 --> 00:45.911
"and Safe Eating
Guidelines for Fish

00:45.913 --> 00:47.312
from the Wilt
Chamberlain Lake."

00:47.314 --> 00:48.747
It's fine, Tray.
It's fine.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.149
Pops told me.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.583
He blessed us
with the fish so we can

00:51.585 --> 00:53.652
sustain and nourish ourselves.
You like to eat, right?

00:53.654 --> 00:56.321
Yeah.
Just like he
blesses us with struggle.

00:56.323 --> 00:58.057
'Cause without struggle,
we wouldn't be strong people.

00:58.059 --> 01:00.225
He kind of tests our
mettle-- you feel me?

01:00.227 --> 01:01.393
And you know what, Boon?

01:01.395 --> 01:02.661
You asking
the right questions, dawg.

01:02.663 --> 01:03.695
And that makes me think, man,

01:03.697 --> 01:05.364
we got to get out here
and deliver the Word

01:05.366 --> 01:07.199
to the people that need it
that can't get to us.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.168
We got to take this show
on the road, dawg.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.869
I'm the preacher
and you the deejay.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.004
Feel me?
(chuckles)

01:12.006 --> 01:13.839
(grunting)

01:13.841 --> 01:16.341
Oh!
(whooping)

01:48.775 --> 01:51.643
Ms. Tudi, I ain't even here
for what you think, girl.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.780
Oh, Heavenly Father,
please look down on us!

01:54.782 --> 01:57.216
Jesus Christ lying to my face.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.617
I know you want some money.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.419
Nah, don't nobody
want your bread, girl.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.887
You can keep
your little purse private.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.288
Mm-hmm.
Then what you want?

02:03.290 --> 02:05.224
Oh, just a little of your time,
that's it.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.226
Baby, what you seem to forget

02:07.228 --> 02:09.595
is, for us mortals,
time<i> is</i> money.

02:09.597 --> 02:10.629
You feel me?

02:10.631 --> 02:12.297
Look, Ms. Tudi,
I finally figured out

02:12.299 --> 02:14.433
why Pops wanted me
to have that food truck.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.068
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, the truth
has been revealed.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.169
Peep this out.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.470
We about to start

02:18.472 --> 02:20.272
Jesus's Church of Compton

02:20.274 --> 02:22.574
and Fish Taco Truck.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.443
Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Say that again.

02:24.445 --> 02:27.012
"Jesus's Church of Compton"?

02:27.014 --> 02:28.614
And Fish Taco Truck-- yeah!

02:28.616 --> 02:31.650
We about to set up,
give away some bomb-ass tacos.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.418
I'm talking about some bomb...

02:33.420 --> 02:35.187
Baby, baby,
what you want me to do?

02:35.189 --> 02:36.655
Oh, I just want you
to bless the grill

02:36.657 --> 02:38.657
with some of your fine
and exquisitely honed

02:38.659 --> 02:40.092
culinary skills.

02:40.094 --> 02:42.261
Whoa, hold it!
Hold up.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.829
You want me to cook for free?!

02:43.831 --> 02:45.364
For free? (scoffs)
Girl, how absurd.

02:45.366 --> 02:48.000
You talkin' stupid.
I don't know

02:48.002 --> 02:49.968
nothing about for free.
Jesus?

02:49.970 --> 02:52.004
You gonna get paid in grace.

02:52.006 --> 02:54.439
All right, listen, you must
need money for something.

02:54.441 --> 02:56.441
Where you gonna get the fish?

02:56.443 --> 02:59.244
Oh, the fish are caught locally.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.683
You better not sleep.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.019
I'm talking
about a bonanza of fish!

03:07.021 --> 03:09.288
Oh, my...
You telling me you got this

03:09.290 --> 03:10.389
out the Wilt Chamberlain Lake?

03:10.391 --> 03:11.790
God is a mother(bleep),

03:11.792 --> 03:12.991
ain't he?

03:12.993 --> 03:14.693
Mm...

03:14.695 --> 03:16.962
I'm gonna let y'all
try this shit first.

03:16.964 --> 03:19.865
(honking)

03:21.301 --> 03:22.634
The hell's all this shit?

03:22.636 --> 03:24.136
Hey, hey!
What's happening, Vic?

03:24.138 --> 03:25.304
Hey, come check us out, man!

03:25.306 --> 03:26.538
You'd better
get you one of

03:26.540 --> 03:28.073
these<i> delicioso</i> fish tacos!

03:28.075 --> 03:29.074
You know you want one!

03:29.076 --> 03:31.176
Check it out!

03:31.178 --> 03:34.079
So a bunch of losers done
started up a new business, huh?

03:34.081 --> 03:35.681
Hell about to freeze over.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.649
MS. TUDI:
Excuse me,
but who you calling a loser?

03:37.651 --> 03:40.018
Ms. Tudi, well, I didn't
even know you was in there.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.221
Mm-hmm, you'd better
quit being a hater.

03:42.223 --> 03:43.589
Try one of these fish tacos.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.424
This here's our first batch.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.859
Ain't no weed in there, right?
JESUS:
Of course not.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.995
Ain't no weed in that, man.
MS. TUDI: That's right.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.064
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

03:52.066 --> 03:53.098
MS. TUDI:
Mm-hmm.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.100
Wow.
(laughs)

03:55.102 --> 03:56.935
That's actually good.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.737
Yeah, man, and the crazy part

03:58.739 --> 04:00.372
is, Pops blessed us
with this straight from

04:00.374 --> 04:01.740
Wilt Chamberlain Lake.

04:03.009 --> 04:04.343
Wilt Chamberlain Lake?!

04:04.345 --> 04:05.844
Nigga, are you crazy?!

04:05.846 --> 04:07.346
Whoa, whoa, hold...
just relax!

04:07.348 --> 04:08.680
This here okay.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.916
All I try to do is spread
joy in your life, man,

04:10.918 --> 04:14.019
and you keep on coming at us
like we some peons, man.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.355
Who you think sent your mama
that big-ass "bouquette"

04:16.357 --> 04:17.389
of flowers for her birthday
on Wednesday, man?

04:17.391 --> 04:19.024
Oh, yeah, I know it's "bouquet,"

04:19.026 --> 04:20.359
but I like to say "bouquette."

04:20.361 --> 04:22.394
Who you think did that
and put your name on it?

04:22.396 --> 04:25.030
You got my mama those flowers?

04:25.032 --> 04:26.031
You didn't do it.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.199
Man, I ain't even supposed

04:27.201 --> 04:28.300
to be revealing
my infinite and divine

04:28.302 --> 04:29.768
powers to you like that, man.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.769
But I like you, Vic.

04:30.771 --> 04:31.870
And guess what, Vic.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.372
I helped him pick them.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.439
Yeah, I bet you feel like

04:34.441 --> 04:35.807
a real dick now, don't you?

04:35.809 --> 04:37.476
Yeah, well, where you get
my mama's info from?

04:37.478 --> 04:38.744
JESUS:
Pops gave it to us.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.245
I mean, he knew it was
for a good cause, man.

04:40.247 --> 04:41.546
You need
to quit trippin', Vic.

04:41.548 --> 04:42.614
Divine insight from the Big Guy

04:42.616 --> 04:44.049
upstairs; that's all it was.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.250
Bullshit.

04:45.252 --> 04:46.785
You's a nerd bitch hacker!

04:46.787 --> 04:48.220
Hey, man, when you get mad,
you look

04:48.222 --> 04:50.289
like the hyenas
on<i> The Lion King.</i>

04:50.291 --> 04:51.556
(laughter)

04:51.558 --> 04:53.058
Mufasa.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.559
Vic, Trayvon a hacker?

04:54.561 --> 04:56.561
He real smart, man,
but he ain't no hacker, brah.

04:56.563 --> 04:59.498
You niggas is a bunch
of identity thieves.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.733
Yeah, I hope you ain't using
the Wi-Fi in the complex

05:01.735 --> 05:04.670
to do some goddamn
cyber crime.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.805
Nah, Vic, man,
you got it all wrong, brah.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.474
No, you got it
all wrong, see.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.411
Yeah, you done went too
far this time, nigga.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.246
You send my mama
some more flowers,

05:14.248 --> 05:16.081
that's your ass.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.016
And these tacos?

05:18.018 --> 05:19.985
You can have them.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.586
Wilt Chamberlain Lake.

05:25.525 --> 05:27.993
Hey, wait, wait, wait,
what you doing?

05:29.662 --> 05:31.129
That nigga taking all the tacos.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.931
He's hungry, man.
Let him eat.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.267
Oh, yeah!
(laughs)

05:35.269 --> 05:37.602
From Galilee to Gardena.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.471
Cairo to Compton.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.707
Probably seen him hanging
around Rick Ross' neck.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.175
Hell, he used
to be white!

05:43.177 --> 05:44.176
Give it up

05:44.178 --> 05:46.378
for Jesus Christ!

05:46.380 --> 05:47.879
JESUS:
<i>Come on out and get you</i>

05:47.881 --> 05:49.548
some salvation!

05:49.550 --> 05:51.183
This baby is
Jesus's Church of Compton

05:51.185 --> 05:52.951
and Fish Taco Truck!

05:52.953 --> 05:55.287
Where the food will not
only nourish your soul,

05:55.289 --> 05:57.055
but please your piehole.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.957
Can I get an amen, y'all?

05:58.959 --> 06:02.527
War, famine, pestilence--
who needs that shit

06:02.529 --> 06:03.862
when you got God's love
and fish tacos?

06:03.864 --> 06:07.632
You ever heard of the term
"undying love"?

06:07.634 --> 06:10.235
That comes from the fact
that I died and undied for you.

06:10.237 --> 06:12.504
Came back to give you
some more love.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.306
Loving guidance by the boatload!

06:14.308 --> 06:17.142
Trees, Boon!
Boon, trees!

06:17.144 --> 06:20.245
For respect
one time, y'all!

06:20.247 --> 06:21.580
Think I'm getting to them.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.648
Get fat on God's Word
this Sunday

06:23.650 --> 06:27.319
at Jesus's Church of Compton
and Fish Taco Truck!

06:27.321 --> 06:29.654
Right here--

06:29.656 --> 06:32.157
and God's Word,
'cause he got plenty.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.493
Ha! You love that, don't you?

06:34.495 --> 06:36.161
God's love is free, amen?

06:36.163 --> 06:37.496
But food trucks need gas.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.498
JASON:
Yeah, we appreciate

06:39.500 --> 06:40.766
all these little donations
y'all are giving us.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.701
That's right.
Where is Trayvon?

06:42.703 --> 06:44.236
Did he make the run
to the store?

06:44.238 --> 06:45.437
Yeah, he been gone.

06:45.439 --> 06:46.772
All right.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.373
Come on, baby.
Thank you. God bless you.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.342
Hello, Jesus' phone.

06:50.344 --> 06:52.344
I'm at the store right now.
Boonie already talked to me.

06:52.346 --> 06:53.745
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.615
Yeah, look, I don't have
enough money for that.

06:56.617 --> 06:59.851
Hold on one second, hold on.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.022
Yeah, hello?

07:04.024 --> 07:05.390
Aah! Wait! That's...

07:05.392 --> 07:07.125
Give me that bike!

07:08.728 --> 07:10.929
Wait!
That's my bike!

07:11.864 --> 07:13.698
Come back!

07:13.700 --> 07:15.200
Hmm.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.002
Ooh, look-a here.

07:24.043 --> 07:26.144
No, no, no, no.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.546
No.

07:31.050 --> 07:32.451
(groans)

07:32.453 --> 07:34.052
JESUS:
Hope to see you all this Sunday,

07:34.054 --> 07:37.122
serving salvation
and swordfish tacos!

07:37.124 --> 07:40.592
Jesus's Church of Compton
and Fish Tacos,

07:40.594 --> 07:42.494
where there ain't
nothing but love...

07:42.496 --> 07:44.763
(ringing)

07:44.765 --> 07:46.064
Hello.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.265
Hey, Victor.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.633
I just saw
that dirty Jesus nigga.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.402
Yeah, yeah.
You know what I found out?

07:50.404 --> 07:51.603
This nigga's a identity thief.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.071
Stole my mom's address.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.139
He's bad news, man.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.574
Well, he just rolled by

07:55.576 --> 07:56.741
the church in
that taco truck he's got.

07:56.743 --> 07:57.976
You know about this?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.644
(laughing):
Yeah, fish taco truck.

07:59.646 --> 08:00.846
You know those fish come out

08:00.848 --> 08:03.014
the Wilt Chamberlain Lake?

08:03.016 --> 08:04.416
Well, he's not
just selling tacos.

08:04.418 --> 08:05.517
He's preaching the Word.

08:05.519 --> 08:06.952
And taking donations.

08:06.954 --> 08:07.752
On my turf!

08:07.754 --> 08:09.788
I ought to cut that nigga.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.591
Anybody taking money from God
in Southwest Compton is me.

08:12.593 --> 08:15.594
(quacking)

08:15.596 --> 08:17.262
Everybody want to judge.

08:17.264 --> 08:20.098
But if anybody qualified to do
the job, it should be me.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.100
I wear the robe
and I'm of the divinity.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.369
But do you see me
judge anybody? No.

08:24.371 --> 08:26.838
Uh, Fish, sorry
to interrupt the sermon.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.039
What's up, Tray, what's up?

08:28.041 --> 08:29.441
I got jacked.
All right?
What?

08:29.443 --> 08:30.675
And they stole my bike
and everything.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.477
Oh, man, they tore
that eye up, man.

08:32.479 --> 08:34.212
Yeah.
Do that hurt?

08:34.214 --> 08:35.213
Aah!
(laughs)

08:35.215 --> 08:36.448
That's not funny.

08:36.450 --> 08:38.216
Yes, it hurts. Okay?

08:38.218 --> 08:40.485
Listen, it was this dude.

08:40.487 --> 08:42.187
It was, it was
two dudes, okay?

08:42.189 --> 08:43.522
And they had shotguns

08:43.524 --> 08:45.457
and there were some pit bulls
and everything.

08:45.459 --> 08:47.325
But that's not the worst part.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.527
All right?

08:48.529 --> 08:49.628
I dropped your phone.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.795
I dropped your phone

08:50.797 --> 08:52.197
when I was gonna
go chase her--

08:52.199 --> 08:54.299
the-the dudes--
and then, when I went back,

08:54.301 --> 08:56.201
it was gone.
Someone stole it.
(siren whoops)

08:56.203 --> 08:57.969
Uh-oh.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.704
Oh, we sorry, Officer.
We see the fire hydrant.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.239
We had a flat; we fixed it now.

09:01.241 --> 09:02.741
We on our way out, Officer.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.910
Have a great day.
Like a taco?

09:04.912 --> 09:06.478
Well, I guess not.
I guess not.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.679
Guess not.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.014
And let's call
it quits, man.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.916
I'll be okay.
I'm sorry to let you down.

09:10.918 --> 09:14.052
Oh, just as long
as you're okay, Trayvon.
God, thank you.

09:19.926 --> 09:23.828
This phone has literally
billions of contacts.

09:23.830 --> 09:24.829
Mm-hmm.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.331
And famous people,
look at that!

09:26.333 --> 09:28.066
Bill Gates. The President!

09:28.068 --> 09:29.267
Russell Simmons.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.102
Hey, man.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.671
You know what
this means, right?

09:32.673 --> 09:34.673
This is proof
that whatever

09:34.675 --> 09:36.007
that crooked
nigga's up to,

09:36.009 --> 09:37.375
it's a whole lot bigger

09:37.377 --> 09:38.777
than we think, man.

09:40.179 --> 09:42.514
What?

09:42.516 --> 09:43.548
(line ringing)

09:43.550 --> 09:44.549
Hello?

09:44.551 --> 09:46.284
Judge Judy?

09:46.286 --> 09:47.786
Hey, baby, how you doing,
sweet thang?

09:47.788 --> 09:49.020
Hey, come on, man.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.189
You can't do that, man!
Why not?

09:51.191 --> 09:53.425
She may not be the hottest
white woman around,

09:53.427 --> 09:55.460
but that bitch is paid.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.295
You don't get it,
do you?

09:57.297 --> 09:59.698
This phone is probably
being tracked.
Tracked?

09:59.700 --> 10:02.200
Yes, tracked.
FBI, CIA,

10:02.202 --> 10:03.902
the government...
Think about it, Lloyd.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.870
The phone has billions

10:05.872 --> 10:08.239
of stolen personal
contacts in it.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.308
We could go to jail
just for having that.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.043
So what do we do?

10:12.045 --> 10:14.713
We get this shit out of
here, is what we do.

10:20.052 --> 10:23.555
Hey!
The phone is being
tracked, Lloyd.

10:23.557 --> 10:25.290
(mews)

10:25.292 --> 10:26.891
TRAYVON:
<i>I mean the phone</i>
<i>should be trackable</i>

10:26.893 --> 10:28.293
<i>as long as</i>
<i>the battery's inside,</i>

10:28.295 --> 10:29.728
but right now
I'm not getting anything.

10:29.730 --> 10:30.729
I mean...

10:30.731 --> 10:32.163
Man, I'm so stupid.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.232
Well?

10:34.234 --> 10:35.634
Well, what?

10:35.636 --> 10:37.168
That's barely enough for gas.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.903
Well, what you think
the problem is?

10:38.905 --> 10:41.773
The problem is
poor people, Jesus.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.808
They ain't got no damn money.
Okay, well,

10:43.810 --> 10:46.011
it ain't about the money
no way, right? I mean,

10:46.013 --> 10:48.079
it's about spreading the Word
and getting it out there,

10:48.081 --> 10:50.248
and you can't front-- we had
a beautiful-ass day today,

10:50.250 --> 10:51.816
Ms. Tud...
No, we didn't, Jesus.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.818
This was exhausting.

10:53.820 --> 10:57.689
You got me up here as
a fry cook, six hours straight.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.424
And I'm an old girl.
I mean...

10:59.426 --> 11:01.860
I still got it going on.
But I'm saying OGs

11:01.862 --> 11:04.996
can't be doing that.
Yeah, she right. That was
some hard-ass work today, Jesus.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.032
BOONIE:
I'm telling you, man,
God hates us, man.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.968
I mean, we do all this,
and for what?

11:09.970 --> 11:12.437
I don't know. Man, I thought
Pops would at least

11:12.439 --> 11:15.373
gave us enough to keep this
thing going, though, man.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.375
Yeah.
Well, he gave us $24.

11:17.377 --> 11:18.777
Here. $24.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.712
All right, so what?
It's $24,

11:20.714 --> 11:22.814
and $24 is not
(engine hisses)

11:22.816 --> 11:24.849
a lot of bread.
But don't start losing faith

11:24.851 --> 11:27.285
right now. Come on, man.
Pops love this truck, man,

11:27.287 --> 11:28.953
he ordained it.
He don't want to see it stop.

11:28.955 --> 11:31.389
(loud thump, hissing)

11:31.391 --> 11:33.324
(engine rattles, stops)
MS. TUDI: Boonie!

11:33.326 --> 11:35.193
You okay, Mom?

11:35.195 --> 11:37.395
MS. TUDI:
The hell... Boonie!

11:38.497 --> 11:39.864
Man.

11:42.168 --> 11:44.035
Nigga, what'd you do?
Hey.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.137
Mama, I didn't...
You did something.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.951
(panting)

12:05.257 --> 12:07.058
Ms. Tudi.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.060
I don't even
want to hear it.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.262
Mama, what a hernia
look like?

12:13.599 --> 12:15.667
I'm sorry I let you down,
big guy.

12:15.669 --> 12:18.870
Don't even trip, Tray,
I'm just glad you're all right.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.505
Let me see.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.073
Yeah, you're good.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.274
Well?

12:23.276 --> 12:26.845
Looks like I'll be up all night.
Hey.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.414
I got to get some sleep.

12:45.531 --> 12:47.132
(engine sputtering)

12:52.605 --> 12:54.205
(engine starts)

13:00.813 --> 13:03.381
Hey, little kitty.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.216
(chuckles)

13:07.119 --> 13:08.820
Hey, little kitty.

13:08.822 --> 13:09.821
(chuckles)

13:09.823 --> 13:11.022
Oh.

13:16.228 --> 13:18.229
BOONIE (over microphone):
<i>What's up, y'all?</i>

13:18.231 --> 13:20.131
<i>It's Taco Sundays!</i>

13:20.133 --> 13:21.900
Guaranteed good taco.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.735
Hey, lady over there!

13:23.737 --> 13:26.304
Take your time and come
over here and get a taco!

13:26.306 --> 13:28.406
My man with the afro
playing basketball,

13:28.408 --> 13:30.975
stop all that, come over here
and get a taco!

13:30.977 --> 13:32.510
Hey!

13:32.512 --> 13:34.579
You... Yeah... Tac...

13:34.581 --> 13:36.815
And we got a special guest
coming out.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.983
It's gonna blow your mind.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.518
Hey, cross-eyed girl! Hey!

13:40.520 --> 13:43.087
Wiggle over here and get
some of these taco! (laughs)

13:43.089 --> 13:44.422
No, the truck right here!

13:44.424 --> 13:46.324
Stop going... Oh, this... Yeah.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.260
(quacking)

13:52.164 --> 13:53.698
(cell phone rings)
Oh.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.701
Jesus Christ.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.603
(laughs)

13:58.605 --> 13:59.938
I don't give a shit.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.439
(chuckles)

14:03.609 --> 14:04.609
Hello?

14:04.611 --> 14:06.611
Is the Pope in?

14:06.613 --> 14:08.613
Tell him it's Deez.

14:08.615 --> 14:09.948
Deez Nuts!

14:09.950 --> 14:11.115
(guffaws)

14:11.117 --> 14:13.451
Got him.
(chuckles)

14:13.453 --> 14:17.488
FEMALE VOICE: Please record
outgoing message at the beep.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.489
(tone chimes)

14:18.491 --> 14:19.724
(farts)

14:19.726 --> 14:21.059
(guffaws)

14:21.061 --> 14:23.061
BOONIE: Taco Sundays,
come on over here!

14:23.063 --> 14:25.396
Some bonbons in the truck.
Yeah...

14:25.398 --> 14:28.299
Hey, Jesus, I think I know
who stole your phone.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.134
Not right now, Trayvon,
the show about to kick off.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.136
N-N-N-N-No, you need
to see this right now.

14:32.138 --> 14:34.205
Look, come here.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.208
(Trayvon pants)

14:38.978 --> 14:40.311
JESUS:
Is that Lloyd's penis?!

14:40.313 --> 14:41.646
TRAYVON:
Yeah.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.314
Ugh, he got it
all out and shit?

14:43.316 --> 14:45.316
Yeah, he does, that's not
the only thing, all right?

14:45.318 --> 14:47.852
This is all over all your
social media accounts.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.420
Every one.
All of 'em?

14:49.422 --> 14:50.722
All of 'em.
Don't worry.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.156
I'm-a get it
handled. Okay.

14:52.158 --> 14:54.492
Y'all know what mother(bleep)
time it is.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.161
It's Taco Sundays
out here in the pond,

14:57.163 --> 15:00.832
and I'm about to bring to you
the original Galilean gangster.

15:00.834 --> 15:06.571
Give it for your nigga and mine,
Jesus H. (bleep) Christ!

15:06.573 --> 15:08.439
Hey, hey,
what's happening, everybody?

15:08.441 --> 15:10.608
I'm so glad to see y'all here
today, man. But, look,

15:10.610 --> 15:12.543
before I get started,
I want to let y'all know, man,

15:12.545 --> 15:15.179
that all my social networking
accounts have been hacked, man.

15:15.181 --> 15:17.682
Somebody put some real janky
shit out there that ain't me.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.051
You might see an old man's penis
up there, but I promise

15:20.053 --> 15:22.053
we're gonna clean that shit up
as soon as possible.

15:22.055 --> 15:24.255
Somebody's just hatin', y'all.
So check this out,

15:24.257 --> 15:25.890
I'm gonna need everybody
to gather on round

15:25.892 --> 15:28.526
and have a seat right here so
I can tell you about this hate.

15:28.528 --> 15:31.863
Jesus say sit down! That's one
of the... commandments.

15:31.865 --> 15:35.033
See, hate is like a fire, man.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.302
And you don't stop a fire
with fire.

15:37.304 --> 15:40.038
See, the way you stop hate
is with love.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.940
Didn't nobody tell you to put
yourself out there like that.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.708
That's that ego.
MS. TUDI:
All right,

15:43.710 --> 15:45.643
now, who's got
Ms. Tudi's Alaskan halibut?

15:45.645 --> 15:47.111
JESUS:
'Cause if it was your ego,
you got to let that go,

15:47.113 --> 15:48.713
brother. That's some bullshit.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.883
Ego done killed more black
and brown men than the police.

15:51.885 --> 15:53.885
Can I get an amen, y'all?
OTHERS:
Amen.

15:53.887 --> 15:56.321
JESUS:
You ever play football,
little dude?

15:56.323 --> 15:58.656
Yeah.
Okay. So, just say
you got the ball.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.758
You runnin', you runnin'
and you jukin' and you spinnin'

16:00.760 --> 16:03.061
on fools. What the other team
supposed to be doing?

16:03.063 --> 16:06.564
Try and tackle me.
Okay. So, you
got some fat-ass

16:06.566 --> 16:08.333
lineman that just jumped off
and he just tried

16:08.335 --> 16:09.901
to tackle you but he missed.

16:09.903 --> 16:12.303
What you gonna
do then?
I'm-a keep runnin'.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.572
What? That fool
tried to tackle you.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.574
Is you a sucker or something?
You gonna keep runnin'?

16:16.576 --> 16:19.110
You ain't gonna tackle him
back? Is you a little bitch?

16:19.112 --> 16:22.280
Man, of course not.
Why not?

16:22.282 --> 16:24.349
Because that's stupid.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.850
That's revenge.

16:25.852 --> 16:28.186
REV. CLEVELAND:
Yeah, yeah! That was
real deep, nigga!

16:28.188 --> 16:30.521
But-but I got a question
for you.

16:30.523 --> 16:34.258
Now, I was just enjoying
this delicious fish,

16:34.260 --> 16:36.594
and I was wondering
where it came from.

16:36.596 --> 16:39.163
Oh, the fish?
(chuckles)

16:39.165 --> 16:40.698
The fish came from Pops.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.800
REV. CLEVELAND:
Oh, really? Because

16:42.802 --> 16:45.036
I heard it came
from Wilt Chamberlain Lake!

16:45.038 --> 16:46.371
Mm-mm.

16:46.373 --> 16:47.772
Oh, come on, Jesus.
MAN: That true, Jesus?

16:47.774 --> 16:50.174
Now, you wouldn't lie
to the people, would you?

16:50.176 --> 16:52.010
Now did you or did you not

16:52.012 --> 16:53.845
get this fish
from that nasty

16:53.847 --> 16:55.313
Wilt Chamberlain Lake?

16:55.315 --> 16:57.015
Yeah, we did get the fish
from the lake, but...

16:57.017 --> 16:58.282
but-but it was
a miracle, though.

16:58.284 --> 16:59.817
It was a miracle.
That's right,

16:59.819 --> 17:01.386
ladies and gentlemen,
you're eating fish

17:01.388 --> 17:02.720
from the
Wilt Chamberlain Lake.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.989
Now, I'm sure that
you're all gonna

17:04.991 --> 17:07.525
shit blood and die shortly.
But if you don't,

17:07.527 --> 17:08.860
Sunday

17:08.862 --> 17:10.461
is the Korean barbecue cookout

17:10.463 --> 17:12.463
at the First Jesus of
Christ Church of Compton.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.132
Get out of here, son.
Uh, y'all come back,

17:14.134 --> 17:15.867
now, hear?
(gagging)

17:17.669 --> 17:19.871
Lloyd, Lloyd!

17:19.873 --> 17:21.205
Come here.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.674
Come here.
Stop.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.443
(both grunting)

17:26.412 --> 17:28.746
Oh!
You little...

17:28.748 --> 17:30.214
monster, you...
Give me the phone!

17:30.216 --> 17:32.016
He's stealing from me!
Okay, stop!

17:32.018 --> 17:35.153
Okay, got it, yeah.
(groans)

17:35.155 --> 17:37.488
It's wrong to steal
people's phones, Lloyd.

17:37.490 --> 17:40.024
And it's wrong to knock
a mother(bleep) out.

17:40.026 --> 17:41.993
Ooh!

17:41.995 --> 17:43.828
World star!
What the...

17:43.830 --> 17:46.097
(groans)

17:46.099 --> 17:47.665
Mother...

17:47.667 --> 17:49.634
(coughs)

17:53.005 --> 17:55.073
BOONIE:
<i>$31?</i>

17:55.075 --> 17:56.507
This some bullshit, man.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.242
Yeah,
I don't know, man.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.245
Come on, y'all. Didn't nobody
say it was gonna be easy.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.747
We still
working the kinks out.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.515
But look, man,
overall, I think we

18:04.517 --> 18:06.751
did good, man. I think we
reached some folks today.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.353
You know what, Jee?
I ain't mad no more.

18:09.355 --> 18:11.022
But I'm tired, hear?
I'm tired.

18:11.024 --> 18:14.025
Hey, man, I guess I could eat
that Toxic Avenger fish, man,

18:14.027 --> 18:16.928
I'm just tired of this
church taco truck, man.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.931
Yeah, I mean, we gave it
a shot, Jee, so...

18:19.933 --> 18:20.965
Hey.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.901
Hey.
Hey, what you said

18:23.903 --> 18:25.369
back there about revenge...

18:25.371 --> 18:27.238
I never even really thought
about it like that.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.373
I just been going
through a lot lately.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.442
It be like that sometime.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.111
But God gave you
that ball, brah,

18:33.113 --> 18:35.213
and he wants you
to run that (bleep).

18:35.215 --> 18:37.482
Don't stop. And don't
get caught up in that

18:37.484 --> 18:39.784
bullshit, you feel
me, young brother?

18:39.786 --> 18:41.986
I'm-a take your word on that.

18:47.793 --> 18:51.229
This (bleep) always got to be
right about something.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.097
Please bless these
sorry-ass followers

18:53.099 --> 18:56.868
who don't have
any faith in me whatsoever.

18:58.504 --> 19:01.639
So I can expect to see
all y'all next week, right?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.341
Yeah, right. You want us
to come back next week

19:03.343 --> 19:05.409
just 'cause
you saved a kid?

19:05.411 --> 19:06.978
God hate me,
I know it!

19:06.980 --> 19:10.248
His little pussy-ass .38
kind of clean, though, huh?

19:10.250 --> 19:11.749
(gunshot)
Oh!
Oh!

19:11.751 --> 19:13.484
Hey...
Nigga, what did I tell you about

19:13.486 --> 19:16.320
playing with guns, huh?
What'd I tell you about that?

19:21.093 --> 19:23.728
