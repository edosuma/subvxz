01:09.581 --> 01:12.128
Rosa! Let her out, please.

01:18.165 --> 01:20.136
That dog should be on Prozac.

01:32.732 --> 01:34.490
Bitsy, shut up already!

02:37.530 --> 02:39.132
Wow, it's beautiful.

02:39.232 --> 02:42.169
I cannot decide if I wanted
the gold or silver...

02:42.269 --> 02:44.738
...but my parents said that if
my grades were good next quarter...

02:44.838 --> 02:47.674
- ...then they'd get me both.
- You're so lucky.

02:47.774 --> 02:49.843
My parents got me
this necklace for my birthday.

02:49.943 --> 02:52.579
- Mm.
- It's nice, but still.

02:52.679 --> 02:56.917
What about you, Ella?
Don't your parents ever send you anything?

03:00.519 --> 03:03.345
- Is it him?
- Mm-hmm. He's taking me dancing.

03:03.445 --> 03:04.958
When?

03:05.258 --> 03:06.760
Tonight.

03:08.528 --> 03:10.800
Shit, 5-0, 5-0.

04:38.818 --> 04:41.845
Headmistress called.
Ella Hatto is to go to her office.

04:42.055 --> 04:44.090
I think Ella's still in the library.

04:44.190 --> 04:48.410
When she gets back, tell her Madame
Rossetti wants to see her at once.

04:51.364 --> 04:52.966
Thanks, Mimi.

04:53.066 --> 04:56.503
God, that bitch Danielle probably
told her about me smoking.

04:56.603 --> 04:58.726
She's always kissing her ass.

04:58.826 --> 05:00.677
Maybe you shouldn't go out.

05:00.777 --> 05:02.641
He's waiting for me.

05:59.132 --> 06:00.467
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:00.567 --> 06:03.102
I didn't think you were going to make it.

06:03.202 --> 06:05.499
- Sorry.
- It's okay. I'm glad you got here.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.040
Let's go.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.052
You make this yourself?

06:16.152 --> 06:19.615
No, it's a New York State license.
It's what they look like.

07:22.095 --> 07:26.114
- I love the energy.
- Yeah, it's like being in a blender.

07:34.941 --> 07:37.626
It's nice and I could show it to you.

07:39.846 --> 07:41.481
Go back to my place?

07:41.581 --> 07:44.432
- Shit.
- What?

07:45.685 --> 07:47.520
It's my dad.

07:48.120 --> 07:51.190
- What?
- Sometimes he hires people.

07:51.290 --> 07:54.226
- What do you mean?
- I mean he hires them to watch over me.

07:54.326 --> 07:58.346
That guy... staring at me.

08:00.733 --> 08:02.969
- No one's staring at you.
- I want to go home.

08:03.069 --> 08:05.305
Come on, Ella, let's go back inside again.

08:05.405 --> 08:08.241
For a dance? A couple of drinks?

08:08.341 --> 08:10.359
I want to go home.

08:22.021 --> 08:24.383
- Get up!
- No, no!

08:32.665 --> 08:33.871
Move.

08:40.723 --> 08:41.974
Go!

08:49.082 --> 08:50.600
Go!

08:59.659 --> 09:00.926
Get in!

09:04.030 --> 09:05.665
- Hey!
- No!

09:05.765 --> 09:08.450
- Ah!
- Sergio, close the door!

09:20.046 --> 09:23.169
- Oh, my God.
- Why are they shooting at us?

09:23.269 --> 09:25.218
Keep down.

09:29.042 --> 09:31.540
What are you doing? That was the police!

09:50.244 --> 09:51.510
No!

10:53.272 --> 10:55.024
He's catching us!

11:00.313 --> 11:01.861
Faster!

11:13.693 --> 11:15.311
Oh, my God!

11:27.573 --> 11:30.810
- He's gone. Come on.
- What are you doing?

11:30.910 --> 11:32.879
Getting us out of here!
What's wrong with you?

11:32.979 --> 11:36.865
- He's protecting us!
- He's crazy! Let's go.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.420
Get off the phone! Where's yours?

11:57.765 --> 11:59.611
Drop it.

12:00.439 --> 12:03.058
Come here. Come on. Come on. Come on.

12:05.105 --> 12:06.535
- Get in!
- What's happening?

12:06.635 --> 12:08.666
Your life's in danger.
Someone's been hired to kill you.

12:08.766 --> 12:10.581
That's insane.

12:37.844 --> 12:40.479
Does this have something
to do with my father?

12:41.714 --> 12:43.532
Did he say anything?

12:55.094 --> 12:56.978
Where are you going?

12:57.763 --> 13:00.246
- I've done enough.
- What?

13:01.266 --> 13:04.286
Ella, come on. Let's go.

13:06.772 --> 13:08.990
Come on. Run, run.

13:41.106 --> 13:42.808
Get in.

13:42.908 --> 13:45.945
- Ella, don't do it.
- You need to get in.

13:46.045 --> 13:49.482
Ella, you saw what he does. Listen to me.

13:49.982 --> 13:52.036
Ella. Look at me, Ella.

13:53.352 --> 13:55.557
Please, look at me.

13:55.657 --> 13:57.723
Stay here, please.

13:58.491 --> 14:00.727
Ella, I'm begging you, stay here.

14:01.127 --> 14:05.012
Don't get into that car, please.
What's wrong with you, Ella?

14:19.078 --> 14:20.880
I want to call the police.

14:24.450 --> 14:26.552
I want to call the police.

14:26.652 --> 14:30.256
The people who want you dead
own half the police in Europe.

14:32.825 --> 14:36.282
I don't understand what's going on.
I don't even know your name.

14:45.971 --> 14:47.807
My name is Lucas.

14:56.215 --> 14:58.885
You should get down, under the dash.

16:02.581 --> 16:04.383
Come on.

16:09.088 --> 16:10.503
Get in.

16:10.603 --> 16:14.026
No, I... I can't. I'm claustrophobic.

16:14.126 --> 16:17.997
We have to cross the border. They're going
to be looking for a young girl and a man.

16:18.097 --> 16:20.266
I can't. I'll freak out.

16:20.366 --> 16:24.237
There are people out there
that are still hunting you.

16:24.837 --> 16:27.039
They're going to kill you.

16:30.142 --> 16:32.440
Okay, but just until the border?

16:33.212 --> 16:36.215
- You promise?
- Yeah.

16:37.516 --> 16:39.018
Okay.

16:40.953 --> 16:42.928
But, um...

16:43.028 --> 16:47.205
...I had an MRI once and the nurse
talked me through the whole thing, so...

16:47.305 --> 16:50.143
- ...do you mind doing that?
- Yeah, I love to talk.

16:50.243 --> 16:53.699
Wait! Wait a minute.

17:07.079 --> 17:08.862
Hello?

17:09.415 --> 17:10.930
Are you there?

17:11.560 --> 17:13.786
Why aren't we moving?

17:14.853 --> 17:18.891
- What's happening?
- Just... talk to me.

17:19.475 --> 17:21.747
I... I don't know what to say.

17:22.194 --> 17:24.064
Tell me about your father.

17:25.114 --> 17:26.516
My dad.

17:28.467 --> 17:30.336
I hate my dad.

17:31.036 --> 17:34.721
The whole reason I'm in this
stupid trunk is 'cause of him.

17:35.708 --> 17:37.577
It's all his fault.

17:38.610 --> 17:40.622
He's such an asshole.

17:42.448 --> 17:45.669
Then my mom dies
and he marries a total bitch.

17:47.987 --> 17:50.023
God, I hate them.

17:50.923 --> 17:52.959
They don't even want me around.

17:57.763 --> 17:59.979
Sometimes dads make mistakes.

18:21.653 --> 18:24.523
I can't... I can't...
I can't stay in here anymore.

18:24.623 --> 18:27.526
- I told you, I'm claustrophobic.
- Yeah, you can.

18:27.626 --> 18:29.504
I can't.

18:30.095 --> 18:31.830
You try it.

18:31.930 --> 18:35.134
- I have.
- Bullshit. When?

18:42.474 --> 18:43.976
Fallujah.

18:45.961 --> 18:48.231
We were dug in deep somewhere...

18:48.881 --> 18:51.117
...watching an enemy compound.

18:51.617 --> 18:53.886
And this dog come up on us.

18:58.157 --> 19:00.092
He was barking away.

19:00.192 --> 19:02.028
Just wanted to play.

19:03.495 --> 19:07.200
My group leader goes, "You got to do
something. He's going to give us away.

19:09.001 --> 19:11.070
So I started playing with him.

19:11.670 --> 19:13.706
He's barking away.

19:16.108 --> 19:18.344
He comes over to me.

19:21.547 --> 19:23.311
Trusted me.

19:29.054 --> 19:31.573
I slit his throat with my knife.

19:33.525 --> 19:37.723
Three days I stayed there,
just elbow-deep in his blood.

19:46.105 --> 19:48.782
Funny thing, we were in the wrong place...

19:50.476 --> 19:53.098
...just watching a civilian's house.

19:57.516 --> 19:59.564
So if I can do that...

20:00.469 --> 20:02.762
...you can stay in that trunk.

20:09.795 --> 20:12.231
Okay, no more talking now.

20:33.268 --> 20:34.871
Whoa.

21:25.604 --> 21:27.139
Again.

21:31.776 --> 21:33.645
Keep at it.

21:48.460 --> 21:52.047
Nice dogs. I don't think
I've seen these ones before.

21:52.147 --> 21:55.087
They're young, from a newer litter.

21:55.187 --> 21:56.769
Haus!

22:03.075 --> 22:04.743
You're not bringing me good news.

22:04.843 --> 22:06.812
I appreciate that you want
to send a message...

22:06.912 --> 22:09.381
...but this is turning into
a major-league clusterfuck.

22:09.481 --> 22:13.185
I was forced to use outside help.
Metzger is back from the States.

22:13.285 --> 22:15.821
His people shall handle things
more efficiently.

22:15.921 --> 22:17.656
All you have to do is find the girl.

22:17.756 --> 22:20.893
If Metzger's already taken care of our main
problem, we can forget about the girl.

22:20.993 --> 22:25.392
I finish what I start.
And when we find the girl, we find Lucas.

22:26.465 --> 22:29.201
We've got other problems
besides the girl, Richard.

22:29.301 --> 22:30.603
Like what?

22:30.703 --> 22:33.572
Her father wasn't just planning
to sell you out to the feds.

22:33.672 --> 22:36.542
He diverted funds from your US accounts.

22:37.476 --> 22:40.279
- How much?
- 25 million.

22:43.148 --> 22:46.585
- Get it back.
- We don't know where it is.

22:47.452 --> 22:51.090
Metzger found something that
might make your job a little easier.

22:52.224 --> 22:54.446
This belonged to Martin Hatto.

22:55.127 --> 22:58.798
- I'll do what I can.
- I don't think you understand.

22:59.098 --> 23:01.100
I will not be made a fool of.

23:01.900 --> 23:05.170
Find the girl, find Lucas...

23:05.270 --> 23:07.506
...and get me my fucking money.

23:22.721 --> 23:24.724
Do you feel that's good enough?

23:26.291 --> 23:28.294
I'll keep practicing, sir.

23:51.283 --> 23:53.552
Hey, quite a place you've got here.

23:54.352 --> 23:56.622
- Where did you find him?
- Manchester.

23:56.722 --> 23:58.864
I've never had one of these
on before, you know.

23:58.964 --> 24:00.793
No one will miss him.

24:09.201 --> 24:12.638
- What is that?
- A breed I'm developing.

24:12.738 --> 24:16.175
You want me to go in there with that?

24:16.975 --> 24:21.780
Only for a moment to make sure
the dog knows its job. Now, let's go.

24:21.880 --> 24:23.982
All of this equipment
will keep you well protected.

24:24.082 --> 24:25.964
I really don't know about this.

24:26.064 --> 24:29.988
The most important thing for
this test's success is not to show fear.

24:30.088 --> 24:32.459
Try to seem like the aggressor.

24:36.561 --> 24:38.096
Fass!

25:30.065 --> 25:32.267
I've been expecting your call.

25:32.367 --> 25:34.403
How did you find them?

25:34.953 --> 25:39.875
<i>I make sure I always know
everything I can about my employees.</i>

25:40.725 --> 25:43.346
Teresa's still a good-looking woman.

25:44.496 --> 25:46.365
Oh, and...

25:46.865 --> 25:49.401
...Jillian's swim team won their final.

25:49.501 --> 25:51.070
<i>Congratulations.</i>

25:52.270 --> 25:55.173
I'm guessing Ella Hatto
reminded you of your daughter.

25:55.273 --> 25:57.342
Why do you want her dead?

25:57.442 --> 26:00.545
<i>Her father betrayed me.
He had to be punished.</i>

26:00.645 --> 26:02.481
<i>He stole a lot of money.</i>

26:02.881 --> 26:04.716
Your delay forced my hand.

26:04.816 --> 26:08.380
I had to send Metzger overseas
to pay Mr. Hatto and his wife a visit.

26:08.990 --> 26:11.424
Well, if that's true and I do this...

26:12.624 --> 26:15.228
...aren't you just punishing a dead man?

26:16.028 --> 26:19.098
Lucas, do know how many people
are in my employ?

26:19.798 --> 26:23.992
<i>If I let one steal from me,
what are the rest to think?</i>

26:24.402 --> 26:26.817
The message is not for Martin Hatto.

26:27.305 --> 26:29.174
It is for them.

26:29.574 --> 26:34.550
<i>Lucas, you have such potential, such talent.</i>

26:34.650 --> 26:37.548
A fine weapon, Lucas. You're a hunter.

26:37.648 --> 26:39.484
<i>That's what you are.</i>

26:40.552 --> 26:42.632
<i>At the moment, you're confused.</i>

26:42.732 --> 26:45.027
I expect your supply is running low.

26:46.524 --> 26:49.561
Must be difficult... I'd say impossible...

26:49.661 --> 26:53.532
...to find a cocktail of the quality
I supply you with on the streets.

26:54.032 --> 26:56.668
<i>You don't know
what you're doing with this girl.</i>

26:56.768 --> 26:59.905
But one way or another, this girl will die.

27:00.005 --> 27:01.840
You have to know that.

27:03.842 --> 27:06.645
Just say a prayer for her and be done.

27:39.344 --> 27:41.146
You left me in there?

28:04.336 --> 28:06.138
Can I use the bathroom?

28:07.939 --> 28:10.208
- Yeah.
- Okay.

28:50.048 --> 28:53.084
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Who's this?

28:53.852 --> 28:55.887
<i>I'm trying to reach my dad.</i>

28:56.387 --> 28:58.275
Martin Hatto?

28:58.375 --> 29:00.892
Yeah, it's his daughter, Ella.
Can you put him on?

29:00.992 --> 29:02.678
<i>I'm afraid I can't do that.</i>

29:02.778 --> 29:06.431
Ella, this is Special Agent
Gina Banks with the FBI.

29:06.531 --> 29:08.533
- <i>I work with Interpol.</i>
- What?

29:08.633 --> 29:11.022
<i>You need to tell me where you are.</i>

29:11.602 --> 29:15.473
- <i>I don't know.</i>
- Are you with a man who calls himself Lucas?

29:17.775 --> 29:20.645
- Yeah.
- <i>Ella, listen to me very carefully.</i>

29:20.745 --> 29:23.114
<i>He's a professional assassin.</i>

29:23.214 --> 29:25.818
<i>We believe he's been hired to kill you.</i>

29:29.888 --> 29:33.592
<i>We're going to trace this number, and
we're going to get help to you right away.</i>

29:36.127 --> 29:37.629
<i>Ella...</i>

29:38.029 --> 29:39.833
<i>...are you there?</i>

29:42.367 --> 29:44.369
Yeah, just a second.

29:50.241 --> 29:53.611
- Ella.
- I have to go.

29:53.711 --> 29:55.279
Please help me.

29:55.379 --> 29:56.915
Ella.

30:20.872 --> 30:22.441
Um...

30:24.409 --> 30:27.212
I have to get to the car. I, um...

30:30.081 --> 30:33.405
I left something in the...
in the trunk of the...

30:44.762 --> 30:46.398
Are you going to kill me?

30:49.400 --> 30:50.989
Yes.

30:54.171 --> 30:55.674
No!

31:09.621 --> 31:11.223
No.

31:17.628 --> 31:19.164
Please.

31:21.466 --> 31:23.435
Please, you don't have to do this.

31:24.235 --> 31:26.071
You don't have to.

31:27.372 --> 31:28.940
Please.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.976
Please.

32:29.701 --> 32:33.138
No, no, no, I'm not going to hurt you.
I'm not going to hurt you.

32:35.907 --> 32:37.942
Look, look.

32:41.279 --> 32:46.037
Okay? It's not...
I'm not gonna do anything to you.

32:47.585 --> 32:50.021
All right? Just...

32:59.097 --> 33:02.132
Look, I was hired to kill you, but...

33:02.557 --> 33:05.437
...I'm not going to do it 'cause...

33:07.205 --> 33:10.408
...I can't... do it.

33:11.509 --> 33:13.311
I can't.

33:24.856 --> 33:26.624
I need to call home.

33:26.724 --> 33:28.760
I need to call my dad.

33:32.864 --> 33:34.866
Let me speak to my dad.

33:38.369 --> 33:40.205
Your father's dead.

33:57.388 --> 34:00.659
I was meant to kill you first as a message.

34:02.193 --> 34:04.395
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

34:04.495 --> 34:06.331
I waited too long.

34:06.831 --> 34:09.067
So they killed your whole family.

34:16.174 --> 34:18.610
Now they're gonna want to kill us both.

34:58.316 --> 35:00.318
I didn't know what you'd like.

35:18.536 --> 35:20.538
You should eat something.

35:20.938 --> 35:23.508
We're gonna be on the run, and...

35:23.608 --> 35:26.010
...you're gonna need your strength.

35:26.110 --> 35:28.713
All that stuff I said about my dad...

35:31.416 --> 35:33.284
...I didn't mean it.

35:34.051 --> 35:35.920
I know.

35:48.298 --> 35:50.101
Stay down!

35:53.571 --> 35:55.406
Come on.

35:56.507 --> 35:58.370
Stay down.

35:58.470 --> 36:00.018
Stay low!

36:07.969 --> 36:09.504
Down!

37:56.961 --> 37:58.763
Ella, get in!

37:59.263 --> 38:01.820
Come on, there could be
more of them. Come on!

38:28.392 --> 38:31.262
You... you drive. You drive.

38:31.762 --> 38:33.265
Wha...

39:03.194 --> 39:05.463
Just keep your eyes on the road.

39:07.965 --> 39:10.569
Are... are you a diabetic?

39:15.106 --> 39:17.375
It helps me do what I have to do.

39:37.662 --> 39:39.430
I'm sorry.

39:50.107 --> 39:52.110
Hey, Dani, it's me.

39:53.978 --> 39:55.213
Yeah.

40:32.450 --> 40:33.618
Hello?

40:37.421 --> 40:38.857
<i>Hello?</i>

40:42.660 --> 40:44.495
Who is this?

40:53.871 --> 40:56.735
- Mom, who was that?
- It was no one.

41:06.484 --> 41:09.820
Got a friend that's gonna
meet us on the train.

41:09.920 --> 41:11.723
Her name's Dani.

41:12.223 --> 41:14.294
She's fixed me up before.

41:20.931 --> 41:22.433
Paris.

41:23.033 --> 41:25.236
May I please see your identification?

41:26.003 --> 41:27.538
<i>Merci.</i>

41:28.806 --> 41:30.374
Hers?

41:34.812 --> 41:36.815
I left it on the hotel.

41:37.615 --> 41:39.317
Right, Dad?

41:44.121 --> 41:46.124
She left it in the hotel.

41:49.860 --> 41:51.629
Okay, okay.

41:52.129 --> 41:53.931
<i>Bon voyage.</i>

42:01.105 --> 42:02.477
That was good.

42:12.517 --> 42:15.152
While obviously we can't
mention clients by name...

42:15.252 --> 42:17.722
...our firm has handled sensitive issues...

42:17.822 --> 42:20.324
...for many high-profile individuals
such as yourself.

42:20.424 --> 42:22.460
I like to think of myself as unique.

42:22.560 --> 42:26.130
Of course, and at Ashland Phillips &
Hornick you will be treated as such.

42:26.230 --> 42:29.500
As you probably know, my previous
attorney died unexpectedly.

42:29.600 --> 42:31.305
Martin Hatto.

42:31.405 --> 42:37.508
Mr. Hatto handled a number of sensitive
issues involving my US interests.

42:37.608 --> 42:39.226
At the time of his death...

42:39.326 --> 42:43.668
...Martin was having his own legal
difficulties with the IRS.

42:44.682 --> 42:46.784
This was very disappointing to me.

42:46.884 --> 42:50.488
And you believe he may have
violated attorney-client privilege?

42:50.588 --> 42:55.015
I honestly don't know if he was making
an agreement with your government...

42:55.115 --> 42:58.963
...turning over information
that could jeopardize my operations.

42:59.063 --> 43:02.049
Mr. Addison, let's speak frankly.

43:02.499 --> 43:06.704
The sale of narcotics generates
enormous amounts of cash.

43:06.804 --> 43:11.275
One needs a secure way to launder
those revenues in the US.

43:11.375 --> 43:14.111
Martin Hatto got greedy and stole from you.

43:14.211 --> 43:16.013
We won't.

43:23.921 --> 43:27.668
- <i>How are your school lessons?</i>
- I got 90 on my algebra test.

43:27.768 --> 43:31.862
- <i>Oh, I'm so proud of you, William.</i>
- I did get one wrong.

43:31.962 --> 43:33.591
<i>And how's everything at home?</i>

43:34.865 --> 43:37.535
<i>Hey, you can talk to me, you know?</i>

43:37.635 --> 43:39.403
Everything's fine.

43:39.503 --> 43:43.691
<i>I miss you so much.
I wish things were different.</i>

43:49.814 --> 43:52.083
What have I told you about your mother?

43:52.683 --> 43:54.752
My mother's a whore.

44:18.909 --> 44:21.545
- Lucas?
- Yeah.

44:23.080 --> 44:26.550
- So that's her.
- Yeah.

44:26.650 --> 44:28.153
Okay.

44:29.353 --> 44:31.155
Thanks for coming.

44:32.423 --> 44:36.260
I wish that just once you'd call me up
for dinner and a movie, hmm?

44:40.164 --> 44:43.655
- Slip in the shower?
- Yeah, something like that.

44:45.169 --> 44:48.676
- They say you kidnapped her.
- It's not like that.

44:49.006 --> 44:50.842
It's all over the news.

44:52.242 --> 44:54.078
Let's get started.

45:07.691 --> 45:09.226
Hey.

45:13.597 --> 45:15.466
Ella, this is Dani.

45:16.567 --> 45:20.251
Maybe you should go for a walk
while she finishes up.

46:04.581 --> 46:06.583
Johnny Walker, <i>s'il vous plaît.</i>

46:18.963 --> 46:20.765
All right if I join you?

46:25.536 --> 46:27.371
How is he doing?

46:31.608 --> 46:35.246
He'll be okay. He's fairly indestructible.

46:37.214 --> 46:39.249
May I ask you a question?

46:41.185 --> 46:43.254
What are you doing with him?

46:47.391 --> 46:49.260
He's all I got.

46:49.560 --> 46:51.595
Then you're really fucked up.

46:52.830 --> 46:56.654
Is it a schoolgirl crush
or just looking for Daddy, hmm?

46:58.669 --> 47:00.238
Sit.

47:02.403 --> 47:04.475
I'm trying to help you.

47:06.310 --> 47:09.847
If you think he cares about you,
you're wrong.

47:09.947 --> 47:13.551
The only thing he cares about is his fix.

47:14.151 --> 47:17.294
Getting high, that's all what he's about.

47:17.954 --> 47:21.268
He's a junkie, always was and always will be.

47:21.558 --> 47:24.795
And I get it, there's a thrill
in trying to rescue a man.

47:24.895 --> 47:27.465
I mean, it's so exciting when you think...

47:27.565 --> 47:30.835
...you have the power to awaken
something good inside him.

47:30.935 --> 47:34.605
Believe me, I know, but this is not the case.

47:35.305 --> 47:38.275
Here is the sad truth about Lucas.

47:38.375 --> 47:41.178
Whatever that was good inside him...

47:41.278 --> 47:44.915
...died a long time ago.

47:45.549 --> 47:47.552
And it's not coming back.

47:48.252 --> 47:52.507
Not for you.
Well, not for me, not for anyone.

47:57.194 --> 47:59.264
So if I were you...

47:59.864 --> 48:02.667
...and had Richard Addison
trying to kill me...

48:03.767 --> 48:07.106
...I'd take this,
get off at the next station...

48:07.206 --> 48:09.119
...and I'd run.

48:09.639 --> 48:11.675
And don't look back.

48:28.425 --> 48:31.295
Hey, what are you doing? Sit down.

48:31.395 --> 48:33.664
No, no, I feel good. You did a good job.

48:33.764 --> 48:37.234
- This isn't even your stop.
- <i>We are now arriving in Lille.</i>

48:37.334 --> 48:40.537
<i>Please ensure you take
all your belongings with you...</i>

48:40.637 --> 48:43.534
Lucas, you know what I'm thinking?

48:44.775 --> 48:46.541
I'm thinking of this.

48:53.650 --> 48:55.719
Just like in the old times.

49:01.491 --> 49:05.096
And this stuff is amazing as gold.

49:16.373 --> 49:18.242
Where's Ella?

49:18.442 --> 49:21.712
Um, she's in the dining car.
She's having some food.

49:21.812 --> 49:24.549
She's fine. You have time.

49:34.725 --> 49:36.560
Do it.

49:37.861 --> 49:41.131
Lucas, come on. Your body wants it.

49:42.232 --> 49:44.435
Why do you want me to do it so much?

49:49.039 --> 49:51.041
What is this?

49:51.441 --> 49:53.011
Magic.

49:54.111 --> 49:56.514
Pure magic.

49:59.883 --> 50:01.685
What's going on?

50:01.785 --> 50:03.520
- Tell me!
- Don't! Addison.

50:03.620 --> 50:06.023
He's... he's put a price on your head.

50:06.123 --> 50:08.926
- Who's out there?
- Metzger.

50:09.426 --> 50:11.262
Damn it!

50:14.464 --> 50:15.999
Hey!

50:21.538 --> 50:23.574
Excuse me. Hi.

50:23.674 --> 50:25.830
You, uh... you waiting on someone?

50:26.540 --> 50:28.726
Ella, move!

50:52.902 --> 50:54.438
Now!

51:09.619 --> 51:11.155
Fuck!

52:19.856 --> 52:21.300
Are you okay?

52:26.730 --> 52:28.598
How do you do it?

52:30.600 --> 52:32.246
How do you kill people?

52:35.105 --> 52:37.574
I mean, that's, like, your job, right?

52:37.674 --> 52:39.624
Someone gives you money...

52:39.724 --> 52:44.132
...and says, "Murder this person,"
and then you just... you go and you do it?

52:52.255 --> 52:54.057
Take it.

53:04.401 --> 53:06.236
Put that in there.

53:26.022 --> 53:27.891
Pull that back.

53:35.298 --> 53:37.100
You hear that?

53:39.136 --> 53:40.938
You know what that means?

53:41.338 --> 53:43.374
Now you got a bullet in the chamber.

53:48.495 --> 53:50.231
Now point.

54:04.260 --> 54:06.029
Shoot.

54:09.399 --> 54:10.968
Shoot.

54:16.406 --> 54:18.241
That's how.

55:10.994 --> 55:12.830
Come on.

55:14.431 --> 55:16.300
You live here?

55:16.700 --> 55:18.235
Sometimes.

55:45.562 --> 55:47.398
Who's the girl in the pictures?

55:49.132 --> 55:51.535
That's my daughter. Her name's Jillian.

55:51.635 --> 55:54.671
Your daughter? You're someone's dad?

55:55.438 --> 55:58.516
- Does she live here?
- I never met her.

55:59.276 --> 56:01.678
Her mother left me when she was pregnant.

56:02.278 --> 56:04.414
You don't even want to meet her?

56:04.514 --> 56:06.750
I don't think it's best for her.

56:07.918 --> 56:12.810
I don't believe you. I think every girl
needs a father, even if he's a dick.

56:15.559 --> 56:18.618
- What are you doing?
- Just get out of here a minute.

56:18.718 --> 56:21.688
- This was your plan?
- Yeah.

56:21.788 --> 56:23.900
Are you kidding me? I trusted you.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.003
Go in the other room.

56:26.303 --> 56:29.339
It's a great plan. You're gonna fucking die.

56:30.807 --> 56:32.609
I thought you are helping me...

56:33.309 --> 56:36.246
...that that's what we came here to do.
I thought you were helping me.

56:36.346 --> 56:37.982
Give me a minute.

56:45.589 --> 56:47.624
No, you were right.

56:49.626 --> 56:51.829
It's better your daughter never meets you.

57:07.944 --> 57:09.446
Fuck!

57:18.855 --> 57:20.657
Now what?

58:41.905 --> 58:43.740
How much would it cost?

58:43.840 --> 58:46.350
- What?
- To hire you.

58:49.579 --> 58:53.197
My parents are both dead. I'm going
to inherit money. I can pay you.

58:53.297 --> 58:54.565
Wha...

59:01.958 --> 59:03.771
I want you to kill him.

59:04.728 --> 59:06.230
Addison.

59:08.598 --> 59:10.600
He killed my father.

59:19.175 --> 59:21.177
Don't laugh at me.

59:26.549 --> 59:28.618
What, you afraid of him?

59:29.118 --> 59:30.921
You don't understand.

59:32.322 --> 59:34.051
What is there to understand?

59:35.091 --> 59:37.141
He's trying to kill us both.

59:47.036 --> 59:49.072
When you take a life...

59:50.707 --> 59:52.576
...it takes...

59:54.243 --> 59:55.746
...yours.

1:00:24.207 --> 1:00:26.009
Ella, put that down.

1:00:29.796 --> 1:00:31.665
Put it down.

1:01:13.500 --> 1:01:15.328
Addison International.

1:01:15.428 --> 1:01:17.966
They're in a meeting. May I take a message?

1:01:19.162 --> 1:01:21.231
Thank you. Goodbye.

1:01:22.332 --> 1:01:25.702
- Can I help you?
- Here to see Richard Addison.

1:01:25.802 --> 1:01:28.638
- Did you have an appointment?
- No.

1:01:29.038 --> 1:01:31.241
Tell him it's Ella Hatto.

1:01:33.176 --> 1:01:35.211
Wait over there, please.

1:01:35.311 --> 1:01:39.766
I have, um, Ella Hatto here
in reception for Mr. Addison.

1:01:40.016 --> 1:01:43.652
The guests will be arriving at the front
gate and directed to the valet.

1:01:44.688 --> 1:01:47.323
There's an Ella Hatto
waiting for you in reception.

1:01:47.423 --> 1:01:50.694
...music will be light jazz
as you've requested.

1:02:05.174 --> 1:02:06.342
Please!

1:02:06.442 --> 1:02:09.245
- Call security!
- No, keep back!

1:02:10.029 --> 1:02:12.032
Somebody do something!

1:02:12.382 --> 1:02:14.288
Put the gun down!

1:02:36.506 --> 1:02:38.675
- Halt! Police!
- Do not move!

1:02:38.775 --> 1:02:40.866
Stand still!

1:02:46.416 --> 1:02:48.725
<i>You're telling me Richard Addison...</i>

1:02:49.685 --> 1:02:53.356
...of Addison Industries
murdered your family.

1:02:54.657 --> 1:02:56.786
You've got to tell me the truth.

1:02:56.886 --> 1:03:00.330
You've walked into Richard Addison's
office with a loaded weapon.

1:03:00.430 --> 1:03:02.699
You are in so much trouble.

1:03:06.269 --> 1:03:07.798
You better have some news, Banks.

1:03:07.898 --> 1:03:10.716
Don't worry. I've convinced everyone
she's a total whack job.

1:03:10.816 --> 1:03:13.076
Have you? And they're not
in the least bit curious...

1:03:13.176 --> 1:03:15.545
...as to why this whack job
wanted to take a shot at me?

1:03:15.645 --> 1:03:19.449
Richard, stop. I'm on it.
Now listen, we found your money.

1:03:19.549 --> 1:03:22.552
- <i>Where?</i>
- That father was a piece of work.

1:03:22.652 --> 1:03:26.776
He hid it in his daughter's savings account.
Our New York fraud unit traced it.

1:03:26.876 --> 1:03:28.992
<i>They're sending a subpoena
to the Swiss government.</i>

1:03:29.092 --> 1:03:32.762
- How long have we got?
- A few hours... maybe.

1:03:32.862 --> 1:03:35.098
And then the account's frozen.

1:03:35.198 --> 1:03:38.067
<i>Then you'd better get her out of there
and get my money, don't you think?</i>

1:03:38.167 --> 1:03:40.203
<i>Otherwise, why do I pay you?</i>

1:03:44.606 --> 1:03:46.843
Okay, this way, please.

1:03:47.543 --> 1:03:49.779
You're very lucky, Miss Hatto.

1:03:50.079 --> 1:03:52.515
Mr. Addison isn't going to press charges.

1:03:53.115 --> 1:03:54.484
You mean I'm free to go?

1:03:54.584 --> 1:03:57.353
An agent from the FBI
will be taking custody of you.

1:03:57.453 --> 1:04:00.657
Ella, hello. I'm here to take you home.

1:04:20.059 --> 1:04:21.628
Seat belt?

1:05:24.874 --> 1:05:27.744
The only reason you're still alive
is to give Addison a message.

1:05:27.844 --> 1:05:30.980
Tell him I'm done. He won't see me again.

1:06:07.316 --> 1:06:09.072
So now what?

1:06:09.552 --> 1:06:11.320
- Don't judge me, Lucas.
- Mm-hmm?

1:06:11.420 --> 1:06:13.056
You're in no position.

1:06:18.093 --> 1:06:21.451
I mean, look at you, running away.

1:06:22.431 --> 1:06:23.800
Really?

1:06:26.936 --> 1:06:30.001
- Yeah, I'm leaving.
- So pathetic.

1:06:30.101 --> 1:06:31.974
To where?

1:06:33.342 --> 1:06:35.153
Far away.

1:06:37.947 --> 1:06:40.143
Uh-huh. And then what?

1:06:41.384 --> 1:06:43.219
Then nothing.

1:06:47.256 --> 1:06:49.058
Not this.

1:06:50.927 --> 1:06:52.762
That's the point.

1:06:55.631 --> 1:06:57.467
I'm done.

1:06:58.417 --> 1:06:59.806
Yes, you're done.

1:07:01.637 --> 1:07:03.840
There's a price on your head.

1:07:03.940 --> 1:07:07.343
It's not personal.
It's just... it's just business.

1:07:11.313 --> 1:07:13.204
I'm sorry.

1:07:13.304 --> 1:07:15.725
You don't want to do this.

1:07:32.034 --> 1:07:34.237
We'll be at the airport pretty soon.

1:07:35.137 --> 1:07:38.711
Ella, I know you've been through a lot,
but we don't have much time.

1:07:38.811 --> 1:07:41.791
I have to ask you some questions, okay?

1:07:42.511 --> 1:07:43.546
Yeah.

1:07:43.646 --> 1:07:47.783
Now, I understand you have a bank
account in Switzerland. Is that right?

1:07:47.883 --> 1:07:51.587
- Yes.
- Your father set it up for you?

1:07:51.687 --> 1:07:55.124
Yeah, it's for expenses
when I'm away at school.

1:07:55.224 --> 1:07:58.995
- Do you know how much is in it?
- A few hundred dollars.

1:07:59.095 --> 1:08:02.098
My dad puts money in every month.

1:08:04.500 --> 1:08:06.936
Ella, I know this is difficult...

1:08:07.336 --> 1:08:08.851
...but we think that account...

1:08:08.951 --> 1:08:11.841
...may have something to do
with your father's murder...

1:08:11.941 --> 1:08:14.534
...so I have to ask these questions.

1:08:20.116 --> 1:08:22.518
Do you ever go online and check your balance?

1:08:22.918 --> 1:08:24.086
Yes.

1:08:24.186 --> 1:08:28.578
And when you do, the log-in information,
your username and password...

1:08:28.678 --> 1:08:30.626
...do you have to look that up
or do you remember it?

1:08:30.726 --> 1:08:33.708
- No, I remember it.
- Good.

1:08:33.808 --> 1:08:35.832
Now we're getting somewhere.

1:08:36.432 --> 1:08:38.902
Ella, I need you to fill this out.

1:08:40.002 --> 1:08:44.031
Just skip down to the bottom
where it says "login information."

1:08:44.131 --> 1:08:47.143
We just need that and your signature, okay?

1:08:52.848 --> 1:08:54.651
Everything all right?

1:08:55.551 --> 1:08:57.120
Yeah.

1:08:57.920 --> 1:09:00.557
Um, how long until the airport?

1:09:01.457 --> 1:09:03.860
Just a few minutes. It's right up ahead.

1:09:04.360 --> 1:09:09.165
Right. Then why are the planes
landing behind us?

1:09:16.372 --> 1:09:20.376
Well... I guess we're going
to have to do this differently.

1:09:27.516 --> 1:09:29.052
Metzger!

1:09:29.852 --> 1:09:30.986
Get her out.

1:09:31.086 --> 1:09:33.192
- No, no, no!
- Move! Come on!

1:09:37.760 --> 1:09:40.128
<i>You disappointed me, Lucas.</i>

1:09:40.228 --> 1:09:42.248
I know you're there.

1:09:43.198 --> 1:09:46.022
<i>I just wanted to tell you, we got the girl.</i>

1:09:46.302 --> 1:09:48.371
<i>She's been taken care of.</i>

1:09:48.971 --> 1:09:51.047
<i>I guess all your trouble was for nothing.</i>

1:09:51.707 --> 1:09:54.010
You're on the run by now, I expect.

1:09:54.510 --> 1:09:56.713
<i>I don't suppose I'll find you.</i>

1:09:57.163 --> 1:09:59.132
<i>Not that it really matters.</i>

1:09:59.582 --> 1:10:01.451
You're not worth it.

1:10:02.251 --> 1:10:04.120
You and I are done.

1:10:05.521 --> 1:10:07.557
You no longer exist.

1:10:29.879 --> 1:10:32.381
And thanks to the generosity
of Mr. Addison...

1:10:32.481 --> 1:10:36.185
...this will be our most
successful year of fundraising.

1:10:36.285 --> 1:10:38.354
That's so wonderful.

1:10:39.054 --> 1:10:40.856
Thank you.

1:10:42.191 --> 1:10:43.959
- Time for bed.
- Yes, sir.

1:10:44.059 --> 1:10:45.862
Good night, William.

1:10:54.757 --> 1:10:56.773
Metzger's behind me.

1:11:10.186 --> 1:11:11.987
I'm so sorry, excuse me.

1:11:14.423 --> 1:11:17.827
I'm very sorry to interrupt.
Mr. Addison, a call for you.

1:11:18.427 --> 1:11:20.329
- Excuse me.
- Oh, of course.

1:11:20.429 --> 1:11:22.138
- Hmm?
- <i>We have a problem, Richard.</i>

1:11:22.498 --> 1:11:25.304
- We're downstairs with the girl.
- <i>I thought she was dead.</i>

1:11:25.404 --> 1:11:27.570
<i>She won't give up the account information.</i>

1:11:27.670 --> 1:11:31.207
Banks, she's stalling.
She's just trying to stay alive.

1:11:31.307 --> 1:11:34.143
<i>Wait there.
I'm going to deal with this myself.</i>

1:11:48.957 --> 1:11:50.513
Open the gate.

1:12:19.755 --> 1:12:21.324
Firecrackers.

1:12:36.205 --> 1:12:38.674
- Find Agatha.
- Sir.

1:12:44.313 --> 1:12:47.917
No one's answering at the gate
and I cannot reach anyone in security.

1:13:32.494 --> 1:13:34.063
Lucas.

1:13:34.663 --> 1:13:36.199
Stop.

1:13:36.799 --> 1:13:39.835
- Why are you doing this?
- This is who I am, right?

1:13:43.272 --> 1:13:45.801
This is madness. Because of this girl?

1:13:46.141 --> 1:13:48.577
You'll wake up tomorrow morning,
you won't remember her name...

1:13:48.677 --> 1:13:50.447
...her face, just like the others.

1:13:51.714 --> 1:13:54.316
Her name was Ella.

1:13:57.286 --> 1:13:59.154
She's alive.

1:14:01.650 --> 1:14:03.894
I thought she was dead, but she's alive.

1:14:05.594 --> 1:14:07.397
They have her in the basement.

1:14:50.939 --> 1:14:52.741
It's me.

1:14:55.210 --> 1:14:57.079
It's okay.

1:14:59.415 --> 1:15:01.417
Everybody just stay calm.

1:15:02.985 --> 1:15:05.754
- Nobody moves.
- Don't do anything stupid, Banks.

1:15:05.854 --> 1:15:07.360
Stay back.

1:15:23.806 --> 1:15:26.042
Take off her gag.

1:15:28.977 --> 1:15:30.546
Tell him!

1:15:30.646 --> 1:15:33.182
Do it. Metzger, take it off.

1:15:34.082 --> 1:15:36.409
Ella, you listen to me.

1:15:37.419 --> 1:15:39.654
You're gonna get out of here.

1:15:39.754 --> 1:15:43.292
- Then I'm gonna kill them all.
- Well, now, let's be sensible.

1:15:43.392 --> 1:15:46.595
We all have a common interest here.
We all want to stay alive.

1:15:46.695 --> 1:15:49.766
- Come on.
- Okay.

1:15:51.266 --> 1:15:53.135
Stay calm.

1:15:53.535 --> 1:15:55.338
Stay calm.

1:15:55.938 --> 1:15:57.773
Nice and slow.

1:16:02.111 --> 1:16:04.046
Now untie her.

1:16:10.609 --> 1:16:12.120
William!

1:16:39.948 --> 1:16:41.817
Quick, move!

1:17:30.933 --> 1:17:32.768
Come here!

1:17:36.505 --> 1:17:39.341
You little bitch. Huh?

1:17:39.741 --> 1:17:41.130
Huh?

1:17:42.985 --> 1:17:45.100
Same gun I used to kill your father.

1:18:12.775 --> 1:18:15.344
Too many fuck-ups, the both of you.

1:18:15.444 --> 1:18:16.779
Such a shame.

1:18:17.479 --> 1:18:19.882
You were two of my better employees.

1:18:21.016 --> 1:18:22.438
Point.

1:18:25.370 --> 1:18:26.822
Shoot.

1:19:18.040 --> 1:19:20.257
Ella. Ella.

1:19:20.357 --> 1:19:22.244
Ella, stay with me.

1:19:22.644 --> 1:19:24.180
Ella?

1:19:29.651 --> 1:19:31.654
Why did you save me?

1:19:38.760 --> 1:19:41.030
Maybe you are a good person.

1:19:42.397 --> 1:19:44.266
Excuse me.

1:19:44.466 --> 1:19:47.436
- What have we got?
- Gunshot wound, right shoulder.

1:19:47.536 --> 1:19:49.972
Get her blood pressure, I'll get the bandage.

1:19:50.572 --> 1:19:54.193
- Relax, now.
- It's all right. You're going to be okay.

1:19:56.278 --> 1:19:57.946
Let's get her in the van.

1:19:58.346 --> 1:19:59.848
Ready?

1:20:04.085 --> 1:20:05.921
Got it?

1:20:07.890 --> 1:20:10.726
Everybody's gathering
on the steps of the terrace.

1:21:21.596 --> 1:21:23.165
<i>Hello?</i>

1:21:23.665 --> 1:21:25.167
<i>Hi.</i>

1:21:25.767 --> 1:21:27.836
Ella, we're going to be out there.

1:21:28.536 --> 1:21:31.773
- <i>Who's that?</i>
- Sorry, I'm living with my aunt.

1:21:33.008 --> 1:21:36.585
- Is that okay?
- <i>Uh, yeah, she's nice.</i>

1:21:37.645 --> 1:21:40.648
I don't really know her that well.

1:21:41.148 --> 1:21:45.355
And my cousins, they're...
they're treating me, I don't know...

1:21:46.455 --> 1:21:50.025
- ...like I'm normal.
- Well, that's good.

1:21:50.125 --> 1:21:55.413
<i>Well, I just wanted to check in
and see that you're doing okay.</i>

1:21:56.364 --> 1:21:57.866
Lucas...

1:22:01.303 --> 1:22:03.772
...did you ever go see your daughter?

1:22:06.975 --> 1:22:08.444
I called her.

1:22:12.013 --> 1:22:15.171
- So I'm going to see her soon.
- That's good.

1:22:16.885 --> 1:22:18.754
Bye, Ella.

1:22:19.404 --> 1:22:21.240
Bye, Lucas.
