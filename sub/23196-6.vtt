WEBVTT

00:12.261 --> 00:13.387
Hang on!

01:07.233 --> 01:08.734
Man, this guy will not die.

01:08.734 --> 01:11.278
Dude, bust out that new axe.
It's got mad crits.

01:13.322 --> 01:14.364
Unh!

01:17.868 --> 01:19.327
All right.

01:19.328 --> 01:22.289
That's 40 sashes.
So, we're done, right?

01:22.290 --> 01:24.333
No. We gotta turn
these into stonekeep,

01:24.333 --> 01:26.251
and then we're gonna
find wynorski the wise

01:26.252 --> 01:27.711
so he can drop his mount.

01:27.712 --> 01:30.381
He drops a freakin'
clockwork bear.

01:30.381 --> 01:34.802
Oh. Okay. Well, I kind of
have a thing with Jenny soon.

01:34.802 --> 01:36.553
I thought we were
hanging out tonight.

01:36.554 --> 01:39.139
Well, we are. I mean,
we got pizza and froyo,

01:39.140 --> 01:42.268
and we've been playing for,
like, two hours.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.936
Oh.

01:43.936 --> 01:46.772
I thought we could, you know,
just finish my quest line.

01:46.772 --> 01:49.816
I'm sorry. I just didn't
realize it was gonna be so late.

01:49.817 --> 01:52.152
Yeah, well, wynorski
is a two-man raid,

01:52.153 --> 01:54.071
so, um...

01:54.071 --> 01:55.530
You know, it's fine, whatever.

01:55.531 --> 01:57.074
I'll just... I'll parley
with someone else.

01:57.074 --> 01:58.784
Hey, you know what?
Jenny makes a great monk.

01:58.784 --> 02:00.076
Maybe I could
get her to come help.

02:00.077 --> 02:01.369
I don't want you
to change your plans.

02:01.370 --> 02:02.621
No, Ted, really,
it's no big deal.

02:02.622 --> 02:03.622
I don't want to be needy.

02:07.001 --> 02:08.711
Look, I didn't mean that.

02:08.711 --> 02:09.961
Yeah, well...

02:12.381 --> 02:14.925
Let's get to stonekeep.
This is a time quest.

02:40.660 --> 02:43.204
Hi, need help with anything?

02:43.204 --> 02:44.914
How can I help you today?

02:46.165 --> 02:48.458
Anything I can do?

03:00.971 --> 03:03.682
I mean, it's just, if we win
tomorrow, we go to playoffs,

03:03.683 --> 03:05.851
but if we lose, that's it.

03:05.851 --> 03:08.520
The season's over,
which is totally possible

03:08.521 --> 03:10.731
"cause stars hollow high
is crazy good"

03:10.731 --> 03:12.065
at king of the hill,

03:12.066 --> 03:13.650
and then I would be
the VGHS captain

03:13.651 --> 03:15.235
that didn't get us to playoffs.

03:15.236 --> 03:16.362
And you know what?

03:17.571 --> 03:19.990
I'm rambling.

03:19.990 --> 03:22.075
I'm gonna just shut up now.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.621
What?

03:25.621 --> 03:28.165
What's so funny?

03:28.165 --> 03:31.084
Stop... smiling at me,
you weirdo.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.090
What are you thinking about?

03:36.090 --> 03:37.674
That I love you.

03:40.010 --> 03:41.052
Oh, um...

03:42.680 --> 03:44.682
That's good to know.

03:44.682 --> 03:46.642
That's good.

03:46.642 --> 03:48.310
Okay, now, wait, wait.

03:48.310 --> 03:50.312
Now I'm just thinking about
how much I just blew this.

03:50.312 --> 03:52.272
No, no, no. It's fine.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.565
I should just get to bed

03:53.566 --> 03:55.317
because we have
the big game tomorrow,

03:55.317 --> 03:58.903
and, um... yeah,
I'll see you there, right?

03:58.904 --> 04:01.031
- Okay.
- Jenny, I...

04:01.031 --> 04:02.282
- Bye.
- Yeah.

04:05.077 --> 04:07.245
Good luck... to us.

04:08.914 --> 04:11.166
Oh, Brian, what the hell?

04:22.928 --> 04:23.970
Brian?

04:25.222 --> 04:26.264
You in here?

04:37.568 --> 04:38.652
What is this?

05:17.149 --> 05:19.276
<i>♪ The city
doesn't know what's coming ♪</i>

05:19.276 --> 05:21.528
<i>♪ she doesn't feel the heat ♪</i>

05:23.781 --> 05:25.657
<i>♪ the city won't know
what hit her ♪</i>

05:25.658 --> 05:28.118
<i>♪ what knocked her out
into the streets ♪</i>

05:30.579 --> 05:32.539

05:32.540 --> 05:35.793
♪ she's already fast asleep! ♪

05:35.793 --> 05:37.313

05:38.796 --> 05:41.799
<i>♪ and am I ready ♪</i>

05:45.719 --> 05:48.221
Hi,
yeah, can I get 18 hot wings...

05:48.222 --> 05:52.434
family combo meal,
and a double chocolate chip cake?

05:52.434 --> 05:54.686
No motor bikes
in the drive-thru, sir.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.188
No, I'm gonna eat
on my bike. That's cool.

05:56.188 --> 05:57.480
It's state law, sir. I can't...

05:57.481 --> 05:59.816
No. No! I'm not going inside!

05:59.817 --> 06:01.443
I'm gonna eat it on my bike!

06:01.443 --> 06:03.778
Sir, you're gonna
have to come inside.

06:05.364 --> 06:08.033
- Sir.
- You don't understand, I'm lost!

06:08.033 --> 06:11.036
I drove 200 miles thinking
about my best friend.

06:11.036 --> 06:12.787
Sir, I can't serve you.

06:12.788 --> 06:15.123
I don't know how to get home!

06:15.124 --> 06:16.834
Sir?

06:16.834 --> 06:17.876
Ho, jeez.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.673
Scott. Scott!

07:04.673 --> 07:06.800
Oh, right. The thing.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.552
Salutations, zwners,
it's the big day,

07:09.553 --> 07:11.471
a day like any other
crappy, empty day,

07:11.472 --> 07:14.975
but bigger, because of esports.

07:14.975 --> 07:17.602
More like OMG sports!

07:17.603 --> 07:19.104
I hate you.

07:19.104 --> 07:21.231
Hello there, I'm shot bot 2.0,

07:21.231 --> 07:22.690
activated just in time

07:22.691 --> 07:25.985
to watch VGHS take on
stars hollow high

07:25.986 --> 07:27.862
in an old school king
of the hill slugfest.

07:27.863 --> 07:30.490
First to hold the hill
for 10 minutes wins the game.

07:30.491 --> 07:33.785
- Should be exciting, eh, Scott?
- Sure.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.914
I think what you meant
to say is absolutely!

07:36.914 --> 07:39.875
But the real question is,
will Mary Matrix let the Law play

07:39.875 --> 07:41.793
now that he's cleared his name?

07:41.794 --> 07:44.922
One thing's for sure:
My best friend is gone.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.966
I can be your friend, Scott.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.259
Boolean.

07:49.259 --> 07:51.427
What do you say to that, Scott?

07:54.098 --> 07:55.682
He's gone.

08:09.655 --> 08:13.116
I brought you coffee and a
Danish, but don't tell coach.

08:14.743 --> 08:16.578
Thanks.

08:16.578 --> 08:20.331
So... how you doing?

08:21.834 --> 08:24.294
I'm good. And you?

08:24.294 --> 08:27.380
Um, I'm fine.

08:27.381 --> 08:29.174
You know... little nervous.

08:29.174 --> 08:31.134
Have a start meeting
with coach in a bit.

08:32.385 --> 08:35.013
Big game today, so...

08:36.306 --> 08:37.890
Yep. Big game.

08:37.890 --> 08:40.018
Yeah. How are you
doing with that?

08:40.019 --> 08:43.147
You get them
new plays memorized?

08:43.147 --> 08:45.858
Jenny, if you don't want
to talk about last night,

08:45.858 --> 08:47.526
that's fine, but don't come here

08:47.526 --> 08:49.402
and pretend like
it didn't happen, okay?

08:50.821 --> 08:53.573
Okay.

08:53.574 --> 08:54.741
All right, I gotta go.

08:54.742 --> 08:56.285
You should get to your meeting.

09:12.426 --> 09:15.512
How you feeling
those flapjacks, VGHS?

09:15.512 --> 09:17.222
You having a good
bruncheon, so far?

09:17.222 --> 09:18.723
Who ordered blueberry?

09:18.724 --> 09:19.766
I did.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.020
Ted!

09:27.608 --> 09:29.318
Aren't you going
to Brian's game?

09:30.778 --> 09:32.613
Yeah, I guess.

09:35.157 --> 09:36.783
Maybe I should.

09:36.784 --> 09:39.536
But I just
gotta say how proud I am

09:39.536 --> 09:41.287
that all of you could
be here today.

09:41.288 --> 09:44.291
Ki! The kart racers
need more syrup.

09:44.291 --> 09:48.295
But VGHS is family.

09:48.295 --> 09:50.797
And I know around here
certain family members

09:50.798 --> 09:52.216
get all the attention.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.508
The FPS team!

09:55.719 --> 10:00.014
But today is about
the rest of us,

10:00.015 --> 10:04.144
and by the rest of us
ll mean the best of us.

10:04.144 --> 10:06.062
Now, students of VGHS,

10:06.063 --> 10:08.190
I just have one more question:

10:08.190 --> 10:12.110
Can you dig in?

10:12.111 --> 10:13.320
Whoo!

10:15.280 --> 10:18.241
Taco boy 14!

10:22.037 --> 10:24.247
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Faster! Faster!

10:24.248 --> 10:26.583
Remember what I
taught you in class today.

10:26.583 --> 10:28.668
- Yeah!
- No! Don't!

10:30.420 --> 10:31.838
Whoa!

10:31.839 --> 10:33.549
Come on, domino!

10:33.549 --> 10:35.801
Whoa. What's going on?

10:35.801 --> 10:37.761
You got it, you got it!

10:37.761 --> 10:39.846
Theodore! You said

10:39.847 --> 10:41.515
you'd be at your
friend's FPS tourney.

10:41.515 --> 10:43.183
What giveth?

10:45.853 --> 10:49.273
You guys are gambling.
You're breaking the rules.

10:49.273 --> 10:53.026
Theodore, we're drifters.

10:53.026 --> 10:54.777
We don't break the rules,

10:54.778 --> 10:58.114
we bend them, then we drift
around those bends.

10:59.783 --> 11:02.202
Why don't you go
fetch us some sodas.

11:02.202 --> 11:03.328
You got it, you got it!

11:03.328 --> 11:04.704
Come on, clutch!

11:04.705 --> 11:06.373
You got it, clutch!

11:06.373 --> 11:08.291
You got it, you got it,
you got it!

11:08.292 --> 11:09.334
That's it, come on!

11:12.504 --> 11:15.298
<i>- Behind you!
- I call next!</i>

11:17.676 --> 11:19.302
I'm looking for a boy.

11:19.303 --> 11:21.805
Fourteen, loves tacos,

11:21.805 --> 11:23.181
last seen getting thrashed by me

11:23.182 --> 11:25.642
in a laceration force
pub server,

11:25.642 --> 11:28.686
then running to the mods
and calling me a cheater.

11:28.687 --> 11:32.023
I tracked down his I.P.
Address to this lame-ass school,

11:32.024 --> 11:35.819
and I'm not leaving
until I take him down.

11:35.819 --> 11:38.738
I'm Taco Boy 14.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.657
What?!

11:40.657 --> 11:42.575
Wendell, if the school
finds out you've been...

11:42.576 --> 11:44.244
I know, they'll throw me
out of the fighting team.

11:44.244 --> 11:46.788
I know, I just...
Ki, you have to help me.

11:46.788 --> 11:48.539
I don't know how to deal
with confrontation.

11:48.540 --> 11:50.250
What was that?

11:50.250 --> 11:51.876
Oh, no, no, nothing.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.753
Um, I just said, uh,

11:53.754 --> 11:55.922
I said that these...
These pancakes,

11:55.923 --> 11:59.134
they, um, can't
handle my mastication.

12:04.723 --> 12:06.766
I am Taco Boy 14.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.353
Interesting.

12:16.985 --> 12:20.405
Did you... want your
revenge now, or...?

12:21.990 --> 12:24.325
Eat first. Revenge later.

12:24.326 --> 12:25.368
Sit.

12:32.459 --> 12:36.129
Jacks rushes to the left with double
smgs, providing you coverage.

12:36.129 --> 12:38.714
Jacks should hang back.
Games should flank left

12:38.715 --> 12:41.259
and then hold tight in that position
until we're able to get back up it.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.263
That's rookie tactics. We need to
throw everything we have at them.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.099
We need to be aggressive.
Come on, Jenny, focus.

12:49.559 --> 12:51.936
Mom, I want to date Brian.

12:51.937 --> 12:55.148
No. Now can we get back to this?
We need to prep for the game.

12:55.148 --> 12:56.649
Let me rephrase that:

12:56.650 --> 12:59.361
I am dating Brian.

12:59.361 --> 13:02.238
Oh. Well, I've got
a game to prep

13:02.239 --> 13:04.032
because you two are benched.

13:04.032 --> 13:06.284
No, could you listen to me
for one second here?

13:06.285 --> 13:08.245
I swear, Jenny, if you're
screwing around with me...

13:08.245 --> 13:11.581
- He said he loves me.
- I'm not doing this.

13:11.581 --> 13:13.708
Brian means it, mom.
Why won't you listen to me?

13:13.709 --> 13:17.713
I am not going to watch you
screw up your career!

13:17.713 --> 13:21.007
When we get to the playoffs, you're
going to have pro contracts on the table,

13:21.008 --> 13:24.636
and you're gonna lose focus
now, when you're so close?

13:24.636 --> 13:28.848
The sad truth is
that guys like Brian,

13:28.849 --> 13:31.601
they get in the way,
just like your dad did.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.480
It was hard, you know.

13:35.480 --> 13:38.232
It was really hard to stand
in front of all those people

13:38.233 --> 13:40.568
and say that I'm the only one

13:40.569 --> 13:43.238
who gets to call you mom.

13:43.238 --> 13:44.739
You're not a mom.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.283
You were never there for me.

13:46.283 --> 13:49.077
And dad, the one who
always got in the way,

13:49.077 --> 13:50.703
he was always there for me.

13:50.704 --> 13:52.080
He did everything with me

13:52.080 --> 13:53.539
that a mother should do
with a daughter.

13:53.540 --> 13:55.041
He taught me how to fix my hair.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.252
He... he showed me
how to talk to boys.

13:57.252 --> 14:00.672
He did everything you wouldn't
do because you weren't around.

14:00.672 --> 14:03.007
So, yeah, now you can tell
me whether or not I can play,

14:03.008 --> 14:05.093
but you cannot tell me
who to care about.

14:05.093 --> 14:06.552
I'm dating Brian.

14:10.515 --> 14:12.975
Have fun riding the bench, then.

14:12.976 --> 14:15.019
That's your call, coach.

14:24.529 --> 14:29.029
- So, you're not Taco Boy 14.
- Yes, I am.

14:29.034 --> 14:32.120
<i>Look, I've played a lot
of laceration force.</i>

14:32.120 --> 14:34.330
I think I would know Ki Swan,

14:34.331 --> 14:37.042
the daughter of the game's
creator, when I see her.

14:37.042 --> 14:40.128
<i>Fine. I'm Ki, but that doesn't...</i>

14:40.128 --> 14:42.839
And I also know you quit the
pub circuit two years ago.

14:42.839 --> 14:44.799
You get bored or something?

14:44.800 --> 14:47.344
No. I simply mastered the game.

14:47.344 --> 14:49.596
It wasn't fun anymore.

14:49.596 --> 14:51.139
That's called getting bored, Ki,

14:51.139 --> 14:53.766
which is nuts because
laceration force rocks.

14:53.767 --> 14:57.353
I've logged 30,000 hours and
I'm still having fun at it.

14:57.354 --> 14:59.689
Jeez. You must get bored
at everything.

15:02.901 --> 15:03.901
Do.

15:05.695 --> 15:08.531
Hey. We should fight.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.951
<i>- Why?
- I don't know.</i>

15:10.951 --> 15:13.328
That's kind of why
I wake up every morning.

15:13.328 --> 15:15.663
Why do you get up
out of bed every morning?

15:15.664 --> 15:17.499
I don't know.

15:17.499 --> 15:21.044
If I win,
you tell me who Taco Boy 14 is,

15:21.044 --> 15:23.880
and if you win, I'll leave.

15:25.173 --> 15:26.591
What do you say?

15:26.591 --> 15:28.634
You're bored anyways, right?

15:32.264 --> 15:33.974
Nice.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.810
You can't win 'em all, loser.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.061
Or any of them.

15:42.732 --> 15:44.191
I'm not done yet.

15:44.192 --> 15:46.777
You've lost to every racer
in this room, Ted.

15:49.364 --> 15:52.325
<i>- I haven't lost to you.
- Be careful, Ted.</i>

15:52.325 --> 15:55.202
And the last time we raced,
I almost beat your kingly butt.

15:55.203 --> 15:56.787
Know your place.

15:56.788 --> 16:00.208
Admit it, d.K.
You're afraid you're gonna lose.

16:00.208 --> 16:02.084
You're a coward.

16:02.085 --> 16:03.169
Ohh!

16:16.224 --> 16:19.310
Um... can somebody
spot me some cash?

16:19.311 --> 16:23.106
Oh, I don't race for cash.

16:23.106 --> 16:25.441
I race for cars.

16:30.947 --> 16:32.990
Let's drift.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.706
The little j.V. Team that could.

16:39.706 --> 16:41.040
What a bunch of crap!

16:41.041 --> 16:42.959
You're not underdogs.
You're VGHS.

16:42.959 --> 16:44.669
Winning is what you do.

16:44.669 --> 16:46.003
Victory is your business,

16:46.004 --> 16:48.631
so go out there
and do your jobs.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.675
Jacks, rapunzel, up the ravine.

16:50.675 --> 16:52.593
Games, moriarty,
cover the midfield.

16:52.594 --> 16:54.262
Brian and Jenny, take point.

16:55.889 --> 16:57.432
Sign 'em off, captain.

16:57.432 --> 16:59.684
Let's go.

16:59.684 --> 17:00.726
Go!

17:30.048 --> 17:31.507
Where is everybody?

17:31.508 --> 17:33.176
They're all dead!

17:33.176 --> 17:34.468
It's been seven minutes!

17:34.469 --> 17:35.928
We need to take the hill now!

17:38.056 --> 17:40.058
Grenade!

17:40.058 --> 17:41.058
Run!

17:49.859 --> 17:51.360
Law, you're up.

17:55.740 --> 17:57.324
Please tell me
you've been practicing.

18:05.208 --> 18:06.626
Whoa!

18:35.989 --> 18:38.032
<i>I'm probably
gonna throw up again.</i>

19:18.239 --> 19:21.450
Ki wins!

19:24.454 --> 19:26.164
Round 2!

20:08.748 --> 20:10.374
Aah!

20:14.212 --> 20:15.546
Unh!

20:28.268 --> 20:30.436
Where the hell have you been?
We've been pinned down.

20:30.437 --> 20:33.857
Guys, I got this.
Just give me 30 seconds.

22:25.176 --> 22:26.260
Aah!

22:30.390 --> 22:32.767
For shotbot!

22:34.936 --> 22:36.395
Go!

22:51.536 --> 22:53.246
Yeah!

22:53.246 --> 22:54.288
Whoo!

23:10.138 --> 23:11.138
Rusty, Ki?

23:13.308 --> 23:15.018
Or were you just
never that good?

23:26.404 --> 23:28.989
Ronin wins.

23:28.990 --> 23:32.326
Flawless victory.

23:32.327 --> 23:33.786
Come back!

23:35.413 --> 23:36.580
Final round.

23:38.249 --> 23:40.209
Where are they?
It's been two minutes.

23:40.209 --> 23:41.251
Just stay sharp.

23:42.837 --> 23:44.630
Remember, no response.

23:44.631 --> 23:45.673
You good?

23:47.842 --> 23:48.884
Games.

23:52.055 --> 23:54.140
I'm... sorry. Uh...

23:54.140 --> 23:55.182
Okay.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.571
Ugh!

24:25.254 --> 24:27.005
- Door!
- Aah!

24:34.889 --> 24:37.141
Five minutes. We can do this.

24:45.566 --> 24:47.401
It's just the three of us.

24:47.402 --> 24:49.654
I'll hold down the fort,
you two get 'em on the way up.

25:15.763 --> 25:17.014
Aah!

25:17.015 --> 25:19.267
Unh! Ohh!

25:27.400 --> 25:28.692
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

25:28.693 --> 25:30.986
Mmm. I'm a chess master, d.

25:30.987 --> 25:33.823
I was thinking what you were
thinking ten thinks ago.

25:33.823 --> 25:35.491
Now, get up that hill.

25:52.133 --> 25:54.051
Aah!

26:33.466 --> 26:35.718
<i>Whew. I've got, like,
no life left.</i>

26:38.304 --> 26:39.346
Get in.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.686
Forty seconds.

26:45.686 --> 26:47.979
They're gonna be on us at once.

26:49.482 --> 26:50.941
Thanks for the coffee.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.696
Hey, do you remember
when we first met?

26:55.696 --> 26:57.406
Yeah.

26:57.406 --> 26:58.949
You were dueling in the quad.

27:00.201 --> 27:01.785
You'd...

27:01.786 --> 27:05.706
Wait a minute,
how many guys did you beat that day?

27:05.706 --> 27:08.625
Cold Turkey was,
like, the twelfth.

27:10.002 --> 27:12.170
Well, then, six
should be no problem.

27:14.006 --> 27:16.383
You know, I wanted to fight you,

27:16.384 --> 27:18.719
but you got all
welcome buddy on me.

27:18.719 --> 27:20.220
Yeah, of course.

27:20.221 --> 27:21.597
I didn't want to take you on.

27:25.935 --> 27:27.186
You're Jenny Matrix.

27:50.751 --> 27:53.170
Why do you get up
out of bed every morning?

27:53.171 --> 27:54.547
I don't know.

27:54.547 --> 27:56.966
Jeez, you must
get bored of everything.

27:56.966 --> 27:58.467
Kl, you have to help me.

27:58.467 --> 27:59.801
I don't know how to deal
with confrontation.

27:59.802 --> 28:02.179
<i>- I am Taco Boy 14,
- Help me, Ki!</i>

28:02.180 --> 28:03.890
I got cheeto to become
the school mascot.

28:03.890 --> 28:05.933
Thanks again, Ki.

28:05.933 --> 28:08.226
I have no idea
what I ever saw in that guy.

28:08.227 --> 28:10.020
- Thanks, Ki.
- You're welcome, Wendell.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.731
I just want to say,
I appreciate it.

28:11.731 --> 28:13.399
- Thanks for the pep talk, Ki.
- Nice.

28:13.399 --> 28:15.359
- Thanks, Ki.
- I'm glad I could help.

28:16.861 --> 28:17.945
Ohh!

28:17.945 --> 28:19.780
- Sorry!
- I am so sorry. I...

28:19.780 --> 28:21.281
<i>I'm so lost right now.</i>

28:21.282 --> 28:24.410
Do you know where, uh,
Calhoun's office is?

28:24.410 --> 28:26.620
Yes, I do. Let me show you.

28:26.621 --> 28:29.624
I'm Ki Swan, 1,360 points.
Fighter.

28:29.624 --> 28:32.335
Brian. Good to meet you, Ki.
Thanks for your help.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.929
Why don't you go
fetch us some sodas?

28:42.929 --> 28:44.221
I always hated you, Ted.

28:44.222 --> 28:45.806
No-good loser for a son.

28:45.806 --> 28:48.183
It's only
for super serious racers.

28:49.477 --> 28:51.061
This loser is the idiot.

28:51.062 --> 28:52.897
You can't win 'em all, loser.

28:55.107 --> 28:57.776
Ted stays where he
belongs, in my shadow!

28:59.028 --> 29:00.529
Wow, Ted.

29:00.529 --> 29:02.197
Be more needy.

29:37.275 --> 29:40.820
Total laceration!

29:40.820 --> 29:42.112
Kl wins!

29:42.113 --> 29:45.783
<i>Kit kit kt kt!</i>

31:27.218 --> 31:28.385
<i>Kit kit kt kt!</i>

31:28.386 --> 31:30.012
All right, everybody, calm down.

31:30.012 --> 31:31.388
Calm down. Calm down!

31:32.640 --> 31:34.141
Wow.

31:34.141 --> 31:36.643
Kl Swan, right? Who knew?

31:36.644 --> 31:39.313
You know, I see
students with dreams

31:39.313 --> 31:43.813
<i>and untapped potential
like Ki here every day,</i>

31:44.151 --> 31:45.902
and I want to help,

31:45.903 --> 31:48.071
in a way that I know

31:48.072 --> 31:51.241
<i>students like Ki
so desperately need.</i>

31:52.493 --> 31:54.077
I mean, being head r.A.,

31:54.078 --> 31:55.496
well, it was cool and all,

31:55.496 --> 31:57.706
but it didn't give me
the ability

31:57.706 --> 31:59.833
to help everybody,

31:59.834 --> 32:01.460
and that's why I,

32:01.460 --> 32:04.296
Shane "stuffed crust" pizza,

32:04.296 --> 32:07.299
am formally
announcing my candidacy

32:07.299 --> 32:11.177
as the student body
president of VGHS.

32:11.178 --> 32:12.971
Right?

32:12.972 --> 32:14.014
Yeah!

32:15.933 --> 32:17.601
<i>And so am I!</i>

32:20.479 --> 32:23.482
That's right.
I'm running for student president, too.

32:23.482 --> 32:26.193
Me, Ki Swan.

32:26.193 --> 32:28.069
And Wendell Brixby
is my running mate.

32:30.906 --> 32:31.986
That is, if you want to be.

32:53.053 --> 32:54.554
You will regret you were born.

32:54.555 --> 32:55.639
What?

32:55.639 --> 32:58.391
Kl and Wendell, everybody.

32:58.392 --> 32:59.893
It's gonna be interesting.

32:59.894 --> 33:01.353
I'll see you at the polls.

33:02.438 --> 33:03.814
<i>Ki! Ki! Ki! Ki!</i>

33:03.814 --> 33:05.357
Wow!

33:11.572 --> 33:12.864
Um...

33:14.617 --> 33:16.785
I'll see you
at practice, coach...?

33:19.038 --> 33:22.791
Screw that. I'll see you
both at dinner, tonight.

33:22.791 --> 33:24.709
And Brian, do something
about that hair.

33:25.961 --> 33:27.963
What's wrong with my hair?

33:27.963 --> 33:30.465
- The... the part?
- Oh, come on!

33:32.968 --> 33:34.678
I mean, knew
it was gonna happen.

33:34.678 --> 33:35.720
Oh, yeah.

33:41.018 --> 33:43.478
Law!

33:43.479 --> 33:46.356
I'm captain Ashley
barnstormer lll,

33:46.357 --> 33:48.359
from napalm energy drink high!

33:48.359 --> 33:49.860
Hooah!

33:49.860 --> 33:53.822
Gotta admit, a month ago
we thought you were cooked.

33:53.822 --> 33:56.616
I guess that dough just needed
a little time to rise.

33:56.617 --> 33:58.327
But it's clear,

33:58.327 --> 34:00.454
you don't belong here.

34:04.708 --> 34:07.043
What say you ditch this team
of square pegs

34:07.044 --> 34:09.963
and suit up with a crew
of round holes?

34:13.007 --> 34:15.592
Let me tell you
something, Ashley.

34:17.221 --> 34:21.058
I made my name here at VGHS.

34:21.058 --> 34:24.643
I forged it, like
a piece of hot metal

34:24.645 --> 34:27.981
in the embers
of triumph and tragedy.

34:27.982 --> 34:32.482
This place flows through
my veins like blood.

34:34.112 --> 34:37.574
So, to answer your question...

34:39.451 --> 34:40.618
Yes.

34:42.288 --> 34:45.416
I won't sign any contract.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.251
Except yours.

34:48.252 --> 34:50.420
Let's hang-glide out of
this loser emporium.

34:58.887 --> 35:01.014
See you at playoffs.

35:01.015 --> 35:04.393
Shit heads! Boom!

35:13.777 --> 35:15.487
Ted! Ted!

35:15.487 --> 35:17.864
I'm running
for school president.

35:17.865 --> 35:19.616
Wendell's my running mate...

35:19.617 --> 35:21.910
But you'll be
first boyfriend, if I win.

35:24.079 --> 35:25.330
Oh!

35:25.331 --> 35:27.207
You're awesome, Ki.

35:28.459 --> 35:31.753
You're awesome too, Ted.

35:31.754 --> 35:34.089
Hey, let's talk some
campaign strategy.

35:34.089 --> 35:35.507
Over pizza.

35:35.507 --> 35:38.218
Oh, yes! That sounds
like a really good idea.

35:38.218 --> 35:40.511
Okay. Um, so what's
your slogan gonna be?

35:40.512 --> 35:43.598
Okay, so I was thinking,
"Ki, the logical vote."

35:43.599 --> 35:46.101
Okay, that's cool but boring.

35:46.101 --> 35:47.560
I'm seeing "Ki, the pizza vote.

35:47.561 --> 35:49.729
A vote for me
is a vote for pizza!"

35:49.730 --> 35:52.482
No, no, no, see, the thing about that,
actually, is there's this guy named...

35:52.483 --> 35:55.194
Oh, man, am I glad
we didn't lose that one.

35:55.194 --> 35:57.738
That would have been
a terrible ending.

35:57.738 --> 35:59.448
- Jenny, you're awesome.
- Thanks.

35:59.448 --> 36:00.949
- Let's go get some food.
- Some protein?

36:00.949 --> 36:02.575
- Yes!
- Okay. Psych.

36:02.576 --> 36:03.952
But we should still go.

36:03.952 --> 36:05.578
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, you guys.

36:11.543 --> 36:14.337
So... pretty close call
out there.

36:14.338 --> 36:17.090
Good thing I stepped in
and saved your bacon.

36:17.091 --> 36:21.591
Oh, please. Could have handled
them on my own, no problem.

36:22.012 --> 36:24.347
Well, yeah, but...

36:24.348 --> 36:26.183
I bet you're glad
you didn't have to.

36:33.190 --> 36:36.693
Um... about last night.

36:41.198 --> 36:42.866
Ditto.

36:44.576 --> 36:45.952
You kidding me?

36:47.830 --> 36:48.872
I love you.

37:06.598 --> 37:08.433
Hey, Ted, dude,
ll gotta tell you...

37:19.403 --> 37:20.403
Ted?
