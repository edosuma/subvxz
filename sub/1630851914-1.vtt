WEBVTT

00:49.717 --> 00:53.587
They think we're
strangers, Isaac.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.791
Trust me.

01:02.329 --> 01:03.831
Hey.

01:03.865 --> 01:06.668
Yo, why'd you fucking drag me
out here?

01:06.701 --> 01:08.836
My knee's killin' me,
I'm having surgery on Monday.

01:08.870 --> 01:10.104
What the fuck?

01:10.138 --> 01:12.572
Why couldn't you just
do it like the rest of 'em?

01:12.607 --> 01:14.976
Wh... what?
What the fuck does that mean?

01:15.009 --> 01:18.211
You dope, you win.

01:18.245 --> 01:21.716
I won, a lot, okay?

01:21.749 --> 01:22.717
Clean.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.551
I lost clean.

01:24.584 --> 01:25.596
You see what happens
to these guys

01:25.620 --> 01:26.780
when they get fuckin' busted?

01:28.321 --> 01:30.692
I... I retired ages ago,
I don't get this.

01:30.725 --> 01:31.826
Why... why... why now?

01:31.859 --> 01:32.903
You were a sure thing, man.

01:32.927 --> 01:35.495
Even if you lost,
I'd make it back the next time.

01:35.529 --> 01:36.807
Only there wasn't
another next time

01:36.831 --> 01:38.465
and I can't pay them anymore.

01:38.498 --> 01:39.901
They're bleeding me, Rick.

01:39.934 --> 01:42.235
Why didn't you tell me this
sooner?

01:42.269 --> 01:45.272
After the injury,
things got different.

01:45.305 --> 01:47.809
I didn't wanna lay
all my baggage onto you, so I...

01:47.842 --> 01:48.710
Who?

01:48.743 --> 01:49.977
Who do you owe?

01:52.546 --> 01:54.682
The fuckin' steroid guys.

01:57.852 --> 02:00.487
Jesus fucking Christ.

04:07.882 --> 04:09.116
- Boo!
- Shit.

04:09.150 --> 04:11.853
- Hey, man.
- Ooh, wow!

04:11.886 --> 04:14.155
I was startin' to think
you got lost.

04:14.188 --> 04:16.423
I... I... you know,
I haven't been to the new place

04:16.456 --> 04:17.490
very many times.

04:17.524 --> 04:18.525
Really?

04:18.558 --> 04:22.797
I... I moved here right...
Right after the injury.

04:22.830 --> 04:23.898
Oh, yeah.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.742
Um, well, I might have been
to some of the parties

04:25.766 --> 04:27.110
you threw when you uh,
started the team,

04:27.134 --> 04:29.904
but I don't remember,
maybe I got a ride.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.081
Probably got a ride
or somethin'.

04:31.105 --> 04:33.641
Fucked up.

04:33.674 --> 04:36.143
- Um, cheers.
- Cheers.

04:36.177 --> 04:38.779
Well, I'm thinking uh,
diggin' the...

04:38.813 --> 04:39.914
You like that?

04:41.148 --> 04:42.582
- New, right?
- I know.

04:42.617 --> 04:44.051
You can barely see me, right?

04:44.085 --> 04:47.420
Well, since uh, you made me
team captain and all that,

04:47.454 --> 04:48.732
figured you'd wanna talk
about the season.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.590
No.

04:50.625 --> 04:54.061
No, I... I don't actually
wanna talk about that, but...

05:02.904 --> 05:04.205
Well, how's the knee doing?

05:04.238 --> 05:06.741
Ugh, really?

05:06.774 --> 05:08.976
What the f... I just...

05:09.010 --> 05:12.046
I wanted to have a drink
with a friend

05:12.079 --> 05:14.148
and shoot the shit...

05:14.181 --> 05:16.150
And you had to fuckin'...

05:16.183 --> 05:17.919
All right.

05:38.873 --> 05:41.108
Wait a second, no, no, no.

05:41.142 --> 05:43.844
Don't t...

05:43.878 --> 05:47.648
Uh, wait, are you...
Are you one of those people?

05:50.517 --> 05:51.819
What do you mean? What?

05:51.852 --> 05:53.821
I don't know,
like the kinda people

05:53.854 --> 05:55.990
that get all
like antsy around guns.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.092
- No. Not at all.
- No.

05:58.125 --> 06:01.128
No, I've been... I've actually
been shooting before.

06:02.562 --> 06:03.998
I've been riding for you for...

06:04.031 --> 06:05.032
For what?

06:05.066 --> 06:07.068
For what? Like a year
and a half now and uh...

06:07.101 --> 06:07.902
Relax!

06:07.935 --> 06:09.870
W... why are you like

06:09.904 --> 06:12.273
all fuckin' wound tight
and shit?

06:12.306 --> 06:15.076
It's not loaded,
so don't go freakin' out.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.222
I gotta take this really quick,
like it... it's my boss.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.682
What? I'm your fuckin' boss!

06:21.716 --> 06:24.151
Hey, it's like
a potential sponsor, you know?

06:24.185 --> 06:25.696
I gotta...
I'll be back in a few minutes.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.264
Wait, wait, are you...
Wait, are you che...

06:27.288 --> 06:29.991
Are... are you...
Are you cheating on me?

06:30.024 --> 06:31.659
He's from France,
you don't know him.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.526
I...

06:33.560 --> 06:35.629
I fuckin' hate France!

06:39.266 --> 06:41.168
I fuckin' hate France.

06:59.153 --> 07:01.288
What the fuck did you say
to him?

07:01.322 --> 07:02.723
He's been pounding scotch,

07:02.757 --> 07:04.692
making all these
infidelity jokes.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.831
He knows something.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.142
Please just refrain
from fucking us over

07:12.166 --> 07:14.068
for one more hour.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.604
Can you do that?

07:16.637 --> 07:19.140
He's completely fucked!

07:37.925 --> 07:39.627
Well, I can't keep this shit up.

07:40.494 --> 07:41.829
Not at the rate
he's been drinking

07:41.862 --> 07:42.939
and the things he's been saying.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.633
You need to stop
being a fucking pussy.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.168
The dude is on a fucking bender!

07:52.339 --> 07:54.942
You need to get out of there.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.878
Let's... let's not meet back
at my place.

07:57.912 --> 08:00.347
Screw that.

08:00.381 --> 08:01.749
Bring the shit over here

08:01.782 --> 08:07.388
and we're gonna leave sooner,
okay?

08:07.421 --> 08:10.324
It's going to be fine,
it's going to be fine.

08:10.357 --> 08:12.359
Trust me, okay?

09:23.330 --> 09:24.198
- Whoa, man.
- Oh.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.066
- What's wrong with you, man?
- Oh.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.101
What... what's going on?

09:27.134 --> 09:29.336
I thought you were gonna fall
in the shitter.

09:30.204 --> 09:31.972
Ain't nothing wrong with me,
alright?

09:32.006 --> 09:33.274
Fucking great.

09:33.307 --> 09:35.442
I'm three for three.

09:35.476 --> 09:37.077
And it's your turn, pussy.

09:37.111 --> 09:40.014
Uh, are you sure
you wanna be shooting out here?

09:40.047 --> 09:42.917
- You know...
- What're you talkin' about?

09:42.950 --> 09:45.819
- Hey, we're friends, right?
- Yeah.

09:45.853 --> 09:48.122
Fuckin' friends shoot guns
together.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.823
It's what they do.

09:49.857 --> 09:51.201
I don't want you
gettin' in trouble, alright?

09:51.225 --> 09:52.860
Don't worry about me.

09:54.428 --> 09:57.131
You're hidin' somethin'.

09:57.164 --> 09:57.932
I'm not hiding anything, man.

09:57.965 --> 10:00.067
I know.
Come on, do what you got!

10:01.902 --> 10:04.905
We're all out of bottles.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.176
Fuck.

10:09.210 --> 10:11.278
Fall off this motherfucker.

10:14.148 --> 10:16.784
Problem solved.

10:16.817 --> 10:19.320
Come on, fuckin' shoot me.
Come on!

10:19.353 --> 10:21.088
Well,
get the hell out of the way, man!

10:23.791 --> 10:25.526
I'm not gonna fuckin' shoot
you, come on.

10:26.327 --> 10:27.327
Come on.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.406
Shit, what the fuck, man?

10:42.176 --> 10:44.111
It's my gun.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.145
I know that.

10:45.179 --> 10:47.481
Bolt action, m1.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.218
Alright.

10:51.252 --> 10:53.554
All right, just uh... I got that.

10:53.587 --> 10:54.855
I think I'll figure it out.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.024
- You sure?
- Yeah.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.860
I'll figure it out from here,
alright?

10:59.893 --> 11:00.794
- Oh!
- I got it.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.496
- Whoa, ho, ho!
- Okay.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.164
- No one gets hurt, you know?
- I know.

11:04.198 --> 11:06.267
Well, you can't...
You can't just go

11:06.300 --> 11:07.434
takin' things from me.

11:09.303 --> 11:11.872
What do you mean
taking things from you?

11:11.905 --> 11:13.841
Oh, no, just...
It's just a little observation

11:13.874 --> 11:15.309
I've been makin' lately.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.145
It seems that you like
to take things from me.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.248
Well, just... just a feeling.

11:21.282 --> 11:22.959
Well, I don't know
what it is you're feeling, Rick.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.018
I'm not...

11:24.051 --> 11:26.153
You're fuckin' my fiancée!

11:26.186 --> 11:28.155
Fuckin' idiot!

11:31.525 --> 11:33.127
Isaac!

11:56.050 --> 11:58.085
Oh!

11:58.118 --> 12:00.622
Uh, oh, oh!

12:00.655 --> 12:02.222
No!

12:15.302 --> 12:17.571
I'm nervous.

12:17.605 --> 12:19.907
Why?

12:19.940 --> 12:23.010
I feel like they're
getting suspicious.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.043
They're not.

12:25.613 --> 12:26.613
And they won't be.

12:28.549 --> 12:30.217
Oh, yeah?

12:30.250 --> 12:31.919
What makes you so fuckin' sure?

12:34.988 --> 12:38.425
They think we're
strangers, Isaac.

12:38.459 --> 12:39.593
Trust me.

12:43.665 --> 12:46.233
I'm worried about Rick.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.169
Baby, we already went over this.

12:49.203 --> 12:52.172
He's a total fucking mess.

12:52.206 --> 12:55.109
He could be a problem.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.978
He's the only person
who can tie us together.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.642
What the fuck.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.281
What the fuck.

13:37.251 --> 13:39.019
Fuck!

13:40.988 --> 13:42.256
God!

13:54.669 --> 13:57.104
What the fuck
were you guys up to?

13:57.137 --> 13:58.205
Fuck!

14:02.042 --> 14:04.244
Hey, Jimmy, come on, man,
pick up.

14:04.278 --> 14:05.379
Please!

14:05.412 --> 14:07.448
Pick... pick up.

14:29.470 --> 14:31.038
Hello.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.240
Hey, fuck, I...
I'm in a lot of trouble, man.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.175
I... I... I n...
I need your help, okay?

14:35.209 --> 14:38.245
You help me and I'll help you
with that thing, I promise.

14:38.278 --> 14:41.081
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.049
Tell me what happened.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.550
It's fuckin' over, man.

14:43.584 --> 14:44.551
W... what did you do?

14:44.585 --> 14:48.222
I can't help you
if I don't know what you did.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.724
It's Isaac and Valerie, okay?

14:49.757 --> 14:50.792
It was an accident.

14:50.825 --> 14:52.259
They're... they're fuckin' dead.

14:55.095 --> 14:58.432
And when I ran, I... I ran,
I got into Valerie's car...

14:58.465 --> 14:59.500
Fuck!

14:59.533 --> 15:01.568
I got into my car

15:01.603 --> 15:03.437
and there was a fuckin' bag
in there...

15:06.206 --> 15:08.676
They're rippin' me off, man.

15:14.081 --> 15:18.552
Jimmy, you know,
I would never hurt val.

15:18.585 --> 15:22.256
Um, well, my advice would be
to go to the cops,

15:22.289 --> 15:23.423
but you ran already

15:23.457 --> 15:25.392
and that's not
a very smart move, buddy.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.362
I... I'm just...
I'm drivin' around, okay?

15:28.395 --> 15:30.364
I don't know
where the fuck I am.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.065
Please, man, please.

15:32.099 --> 15:36.638
So you should probably go
to a friend's house and...

15:36.671 --> 15:39.072
And lie low for a little bit.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.141
Okay, I... I... I'll...
I'll be there soon.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.409
What? No, no, no, no!

15:42.442 --> 15:43.587
You think
they won't check my house?

15:43.611 --> 15:46.179
<i>What the fuck is wrong with you?</i>

15:46.213 --> 15:48.582
Fuck, no, no!

15:48.616 --> 15:50.785
Okay, look, yeah,
I know somebody.

15:55.623 --> 15:57.224
Oh, fuck!

15:59.293 --> 16:00.527
Okay.

16:55.382 --> 16:58.620
Fool!

16:58.653 --> 17:01.856
Have you even made contact
with your boy?

17:01.889 --> 17:06.293
It's 9:00 and you've given me
no indication that...

17:06.326 --> 17:07.729
That we're doing business.

17:10.497 --> 17:13.400
I'm losing my Patience.

17:13.433 --> 17:17.170
I will give you
until 12:00 noon, tomorrow.

17:17.204 --> 17:21.709
Not... not 1:00
or something, "oh, 12:30."

17:21.743 --> 17:23.410
No.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.379
Noon, tomorrow.

17:25.412 --> 17:29.249
Listen, you creepy fuck.

17:29.282 --> 17:32.352
When shit gets messy,

17:32.386 --> 17:36.289
I have my own way
of gettin' this cleaned up.

17:36.323 --> 17:38.960
Do that, mate.

17:41.896 --> 17:44.398
I'll be in touch.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.901
You can touch your own cock.

19:47.622 --> 19:50.390
You guys
check the security cameras?

19:50.423 --> 19:51.863
Front cams are
the only ones workin'.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.529
Convenient.

19:55.562 --> 19:56.596
She worked at the museum.

19:56.631 --> 19:59.533
We should send someone
over there.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.002
What do you think?

20:03.403 --> 20:04.939
I don't like makin' assumptions.

20:07.507 --> 20:10.645
Found a scorecard
from the golf club.

20:10.678 --> 20:13.346
Today's date.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.515
Might still be open.

20:15.549 --> 20:16.818
Take one of the boys with you.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.361
Yo, what's up?

20:29.997 --> 20:32.800
Any sign of him?

20:32.834 --> 20:36.838
No, I haven't,
but I swope by Rick's spot.

20:36.871 --> 20:40.675
Bad scene, yellow tape, lights,
homicide detectives.

20:40.708 --> 20:41.985
Looks like somebody
caught a body

20:42.009 --> 20:44.511
in that motherfucker.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.413
<i>Fuck!</i>

20:46.446 --> 20:48.616
You need to find Rick.

20:48.649 --> 20:53.087
Yuppie fuck has a second house
on the southend.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.922
<i>Cops won't be there.</i>

20:54.956 --> 20:56.456
Yeah, dead ass.

20:56.489 --> 20:59.727
Yeah, yeah, alright, I got it.

20:59.760 --> 21:00.995
Do what you do.

21:39.834 --> 21:40.968
Come on!

23:34.882 --> 23:35.649
Yeah,
I was wonderin' if you happen to see

23:35.683 --> 23:37.318
a certain member
around here today.

23:37.351 --> 23:39.253
Rick Van pelt.

23:39.286 --> 23:40.955
Ah, Rick.

23:40.988 --> 23:43.324
Yeah, he does his drinking
on the course.

23:43.357 --> 23:46.260
Um, doesn't come into the bar
that often.

23:46.293 --> 23:48.262
You want a drink?

23:48.295 --> 23:50.297
Nah, thanks, I'm good.

23:50.331 --> 23:51.265
But you can tell me
do you know somebody

23:51.298 --> 23:53.801
with the initials drj.

23:53.834 --> 23:57.071
Looks like Rick was on the links
with him earlier today.

23:57.104 --> 23:58.815
You know, I could have somebody
pull the members list,

23:58.839 --> 24:00.150
but that won't be
until tomorrow morning

24:00.174 --> 24:01.175
at the earliest.

24:05.112 --> 24:06.147
It's not initials.

24:06.180 --> 24:07.982
It's Dr. J, it's his name.

24:09.884 --> 24:13.287
Yeah, right, Dr. Jimmy,
goes by Dr. J.

24:13.320 --> 24:14.955
Um, weird fella.

24:17.324 --> 24:19.592
Thanks. Get this guy a drink.

25:00.901 --> 25:05.306
Yo, Oscar, we ran through
this whole damn yuppie house.

25:05.339 --> 25:06.339
No Rick.

25:09.076 --> 25:10.778
Looks like Ricky been
chillin' with our boy

25:10.811 --> 25:12.246
Dr. Jimmy dog.

25:14.014 --> 25:16.984
<i>Guys, you know how much
that piece of shit owes us</i>

25:17.017 --> 25:18.752
<i>and our suppliers.</i>

25:20.154 --> 25:22.156
I bet.

25:22.189 --> 25:25.326
I'll keep you in the loop,
big dog.

25:25.359 --> 25:27.795
<i>Nacho,
don't come back without Rick.</i>

25:35.436 --> 25:38.339
<i>Hey, Malcolm, it's... it's Rick.</i>

25:38.372 --> 25:41.809
<i>Um, yeah, uh,
I'm just at the gate.</i>

25:41.842 --> 25:45.079
<i>Uh, kinda need a favor.</i>

25:52.019 --> 25:53.454
Whoa!

25:53.487 --> 25:55.089
Ha-ha!

25:57.091 --> 25:58.259
Malcolm!

25:58.292 --> 26:00.794
Rick, how are you?

26:02.863 --> 26:05.966
Uh, fuck, I've been better.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.737
Just uh, just lookin' for a...
A familiar place to stay.

26:10.871 --> 26:12.940
Oh, not to worry,
we've all been there.

26:13.874 --> 26:15.342
You need help
with any of those bags?

26:15.376 --> 26:17.144
No, I'm okay, it's uh...

26:19.513 --> 26:20.915
Just this.

26:20.948 --> 26:23.284
Ah,
just the bare necessities, huh.

26:23.317 --> 26:25.186
Gym bag and a mystery package.

26:26.854 --> 26:29.223
Is that a gift in exchange
for my hospitality?

26:30.858 --> 26:33.961
No, I just uh,
I grabbed what I could.

26:35.763 --> 26:38.265
Uh, yeah, I don't think
it's gonna work out w...

26:38.299 --> 26:40.901
With me and val.

26:40.935 --> 26:44.104
Things went south pretty quick.

26:44.138 --> 26:46.740
Oh, I'm really sorry, man.

26:46.774 --> 26:48.175
Get in here, huh?

27:04.992 --> 27:08.128
Yeah, hope you don't mind,
but I have a bit of company.

27:12.166 --> 27:15.302
Looks like someone
had a bit too much.

27:18.539 --> 27:22.443
What's the uh...
What's the occasion?

27:22.476 --> 27:25.279
I mean for the party?

27:25.312 --> 27:29.083
Oh, I uh,
just played at the grand opening

27:29.116 --> 27:31.051
of a new club last night.

27:31.085 --> 27:33.254
Real wild shit, you know?

27:39.593 --> 27:41.895
Yeah.

27:43.097 --> 27:44.999
Wild is right.

27:51.606 --> 27:54.208
And the party followed me here.

27:54.241 --> 27:56.844
As you can see there's
no shortage of beautiful dames.

27:59.980 --> 28:01.482
But enough of that.

28:01.515 --> 28:03.183
Let's show you
to your sleeping quarters,

28:03.217 --> 28:04.385
good sir.

28:12.426 --> 28:14.395
I've missed you, Rick.

28:14.428 --> 28:16.196
This really is a nice surprise.

28:16.230 --> 28:19.833
Yeah, I uh...
I wish the circumstances were...

28:19.867 --> 28:21.335
Were better.

28:21.368 --> 28:24.238
I mean maybe tomorrow,
after breakfast,

28:24.271 --> 28:26.840
we... we can catch up.

28:26.874 --> 28:28.842
I'm fuckin' wrecked, man,
I gotta hit the sack.

28:28.876 --> 28:31.512
That's totally cool,
perfectly fine.

28:31.545 --> 28:34.815
Now let's see here.
What's behind door number one?

28:41.188 --> 28:42.823
Moving on.

28:45.025 --> 28:47.961
Ah, that's more like it.

28:47.995 --> 28:49.430
Sorry about that.

28:49.463 --> 28:51.432
This place can turn
into quite the love shack.

28:51.465 --> 28:53.100
Yeah.

28:53.133 --> 28:54.068
Yeah.

28:54.101 --> 29:00.240
Uh, fuck, the last couple hours

29:00.274 --> 29:04.378
um, you know, I...
I didn't even see it comin'.

29:04.411 --> 29:07.081
Yeah, if you
don't mind me prying a bit,

29:07.114 --> 29:08.474
what happened with you
and Valerie?

29:12.152 --> 29:14.121
She was fuckin' my team captain.

29:16.256 --> 29:18.892
Captain of the fuckin' team
that I own.

29:18.926 --> 29:21.095
Yeah, that's heavy.

29:21.128 --> 29:24.565
Yeah, and uh, I don't know, I...

29:24.598 --> 29:26.967
It didn't end...
It didn't end pretty,

29:27.000 --> 29:30.304
but that... that's another story.

29:30.337 --> 29:34.208
Well, if it's any consolation,
I was never a big fan.

29:36.043 --> 29:39.480
Uh, yes, it's... it's good
to have somebody on my side.

29:39.513 --> 29:42.049
Hmm, you want my advice?

29:42.082 --> 29:45.119
Take a shower
and get some shut-eye.

29:45.152 --> 29:47.287
I'll see you in the morning.

29:47.321 --> 29:49.556
Now if you need anything,
I'm just down the hall.

29:49.590 --> 29:51.225
Thanks.

29:51.258 --> 29:54.328
Oh, and uh,
knock first if you do.

30:57.458 --> 30:59.694
This is Dr. J.

30:59.727 --> 31:01.195
Hi, doctor, I'm with the police.

31:01.228 --> 31:02.668
I need to ask you
a couple of things.

31:06.133 --> 31:07.434
Are you a cop or a detective?

31:10.537 --> 31:12.172
Detective.

31:12.206 --> 31:13.273
Do you mind if I come in?

31:17.411 --> 31:19.346
It's a little too late
for a house call.

31:19.379 --> 31:20.981
<i>Not that I do house calls,
but...</i>

31:24.117 --> 31:26.654
<i>Yeah, give me two minutes.</i>

31:28.756 --> 31:30.257
Alright, I'll wait.

31:31.258 --> 31:32.359
How can I help you?

31:32.392 --> 31:36.129
Your patient, friend,
Rick Van pelt.

31:38.465 --> 31:40.033
You know where he is?

31:40.067 --> 31:41.368
Not at the moment.

31:41.401 --> 31:45.072
I last spoke to him
this afternoon.

31:45.105 --> 31:46.708
Hmm, where exactly was that?

31:46.741 --> 31:48.643
We played a couple of rounds
together.

31:48.676 --> 31:51.278
Uh, can I ask
what all this is about?

31:51.311 --> 31:52.388
You know,
something serious went down

31:52.412 --> 31:54.047
at Rick's place tonight.

31:54.081 --> 31:55.516
A couple of people are dead.

31:55.549 --> 31:56.818
Close associates.

31:56.851 --> 31:58.285
- So now i'm...
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

31:58.318 --> 32:00.087
Do I need to have
a fucking lawyer here?

32:00.120 --> 32:00.989
Doctor, listen to me.

32:01.054 --> 32:03.056
I'm not here to incriminate you
or Rick.

32:03.090 --> 32:04.692
I'm just here to find out
what happened.

32:04.726 --> 32:05.793
And why.

32:10.163 --> 32:11.598
Can we help each other?

32:17.371 --> 32:19.473
Well,
it is of my professional opinion

32:19.506 --> 32:22.576
that Rick is not capable
of murdering anybody.

32:25.212 --> 32:26.790
If you change your mind
and wanna help your friend,

32:26.814 --> 32:28.215
here's my card.

32:47.234 --> 32:49.303
Did you guys find anything else?

32:49.336 --> 32:51.773
<i>Isaac,
the gym where he trains at,</i>

32:51.806 --> 32:53.249
I think you and your boys
in vice know him

32:53.273 --> 32:54.308
pretty fuckin' well.

32:54.341 --> 32:56.276
The fuckin' steroids
are runnin' the whole show.

32:56.310 --> 32:57.144
A couple of days ago,

32:57.177 --> 32:59.146
a few guys got popped
on a coke bust

32:59.179 --> 33:01.114
holdin' a decent stash of juice.

33:01.148 --> 33:03.751
High-quality shit that Oscar
and his goons push.

33:03.785 --> 33:05.185
Juice heads.

33:05.218 --> 33:06.688
Cyclists.

33:06.721 --> 33:08.823
This shit
could be international.

33:08.856 --> 33:11.191
<i>Oscar fucks up, we got him.</i>

33:19.232 --> 33:22.770
You killed them.

33:22.804 --> 33:25.773
You killed them.

33:25.807 --> 33:27.709
You killed them.

33:29.343 --> 33:31.813
Rick Van pelt is dead.

34:31.673 --> 34:35.542
You know,
I've owned this piece for 23 years.

34:35.575 --> 34:39.513
It... it's been
in my gallery for 17

34:39.546 --> 34:42.650
and nobody paid it
a second thought

34:42.684 --> 34:46.553
until the artist disappeared.

34:46.586 --> 34:50.290
And then all of a sudden,
it spiked.

34:50.323 --> 34:55.429
It's become my most s...
Sought-after piece.

34:55.462 --> 34:59.767
Now why would anybody
think that way?

34:59.801 --> 35:04.772
Why would anybody get enjoyment
out of such images of pain?

35:04.806 --> 35:06.506
Hmm.

35:06.540 --> 35:08.009
Detective Morrison.

35:08.042 --> 35:11.445
Homicide.

35:11.478 --> 35:13.547
Oh.

35:13.580 --> 35:15.016
I thought you were an educator

35:15.049 --> 35:18.686
the way you were
admiring my work.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.454
I... I know
it's a little pretentious

35:20.487 --> 35:23.758
to have a...
A gallery where you...

35:23.791 --> 35:26.627
As much as I'd love to discuss
uh, all of this,

35:26.661 --> 35:27.871
I need to ask you
a couple of questions

35:27.895 --> 35:30.665
about your employee
Valerie renard.

35:32.633 --> 35:34.669
Ask away.

35:34.702 --> 35:36.312
Well, I imagine you were one
of the last people

35:36.336 --> 35:37.471
to see her alive.

35:39.607 --> 35:41.487
She was shot in the throat
earlier this evening.

35:43.577 --> 35:44.846
Oh.

35:44.879 --> 35:47.581
Uh, no, I um...

35:48.950 --> 35:51.886
She... she... she... she...
She was my assistant um,

35:51.919 --> 35:55.455
but... but... she... she...

35:55.489 --> 35:58.492
Oh, she was a real close friend.

36:01.896 --> 36:02.896
Sir...

36:04.832 --> 36:06.667
Did she have any reason
to steal from you?

36:08.803 --> 36:09.947
Was she supposed to be
in possession

36:09.971 --> 36:12.673
of one
of your establishment's pieces?

36:13.808 --> 36:15.442
No.

36:15.475 --> 36:17.812
B... but if you talk to Valerie,
I'm s...

36:17.845 --> 36:20.782
Sir, she's dead.

36:20.815 --> 36:22.750
I... oh.

36:22.784 --> 36:28.588
I... if you could ask her,
she'd have an explanation.

36:28.623 --> 36:30.024
She'd have an explanation.

36:40.668 --> 36:41.969
Did you recover the painting?

36:42.003 --> 36:43.503
No.

36:44.739 --> 36:45.916
But we're almost certain
it's in the possession

36:45.940 --> 36:48.575
of our prime suspect.

36:48.609 --> 36:50.611
You... you've got a suspect?

36:50.645 --> 36:52.479
Her fiancé.

36:52.512 --> 36:53.781
Rick Van pelt.

36:55.817 --> 36:57.027
They were engaged
for a few months,

36:57.051 --> 36:59.319
but uh,
hadn't dated very long prior.

37:01.488 --> 37:02.824
It's late.

37:06.160 --> 37:09.496
Come down the station tomorrow
and talk to the boys.

37:09.529 --> 37:10.698
Alright.

37:14.168 --> 37:15.770
One last thing.

37:15.803 --> 37:18.739
Send over the access code
to your security camera server.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.447
Send it now.

38:56.837 --> 38:58.873
His therapist knows something.

38:58.906 --> 38:59.983
He didn't give me much
to work with,

39:00.007 --> 39:01.167
but I think he wants to help.

39:06.579 --> 39:08.448
What about
Andy warhol over there?

39:09.817 --> 39:12.485
He doesn't wanna talk,
but he knows something.

39:12.519 --> 39:14.822
I got a weird fuckin' feeling
about that guy.

39:14.855 --> 39:17.524
You can see it in his eyes.

39:17.557 --> 39:20.094
Dude's on another planet.

39:20.127 --> 39:23.798
Yeah, first off, he doesn't
leave the fucking gallery.

39:23.831 --> 39:26.200
Then he went dead silent
when I asked him to come in.

39:38.145 --> 39:39.780
Plus, I've heard
he's into darker shit,

39:39.814 --> 39:40.814
if you know what I mean.

39:56.797 --> 39:57.832
Money laundering.

39:59.133 --> 40:00.567
Trafficking.

40:02.103 --> 40:03.804
Missing people.

41:05.800 --> 41:08.169
Ooh, that's some good shit,
jimbo.

41:08.202 --> 41:10.071
Uh, office hours are closed.

41:10.104 --> 41:12.173
That's not what we ask,
motherfucker.

41:12.206 --> 41:15.342
Um, uh, can I... can I help you?

41:19.213 --> 41:21.291
Come on, man, you bet
a lot of money on your partner,

41:21.315 --> 41:23.117
didn't you?

41:28.289 --> 41:29.523
Come on, man.

41:29.557 --> 41:31.959
You know them French fucks
are gonna come cut you up, man.

41:31.992 --> 41:33.661
They ain't as nice as me.

41:37.164 --> 41:38.999
I'm willing to comply
with whatever you need.

41:39.033 --> 41:42.636
Um, there's a...
There's a safe upstairs

41:42.670 --> 41:44.405
with a combination.

41:44.438 --> 41:46.674
Man, I'm not lookin'
for no money.

41:46.707 --> 41:49.076
I'm lookin' for Rick, man.

41:49.110 --> 41:54.281
Well, um,
I haven't spoken with him.

41:54.315 --> 41:56.350
Where the fuck is Rick at?

41:56.383 --> 41:57.651
- Yeah.
- Where's Rick?

41:57.685 --> 41:58.352
Yeah, give us fuckin' Rick.

41:58.385 --> 42:00.020
You gonna speak!

42:00.054 --> 42:03.090
Look, I do... I... I... I...
I don't know where he is.

42:42.463 --> 42:43.998
Yes, master?

42:47.902 --> 42:49.403
<i>Malcolm.</i>

42:49.436 --> 42:52.072
<i>Malcolm, my dear boy.</i>

42:52.106 --> 42:54.942
So you're trippin' the light
fantastic tonight?

42:59.013 --> 43:00.414
I've got a feeling
you don't care

43:00.447 --> 43:02.049
and something's wrong.

43:04.952 --> 43:09.056
I know that you and Valerie
traveled in the same circles.

43:11.992 --> 43:13.861
Yes, we've met.

43:20.935 --> 43:23.003
For once, I may actually
have something you need.

43:49.296 --> 43:53.801
Well, she was handling
a rather large transaction

43:53.834 --> 43:54.802
for me this evening.

43:54.835 --> 43:57.137
It was a very expensive piece.

43:57.171 --> 43:59.373
It seems to have gone missing.

44:02.443 --> 44:05.980
<i>As well as the enumeration
for that piece.</i>

44:11.485 --> 44:16.790
And I was wondering
whether somebody in your circle

44:16.824 --> 44:19.460
might know
what the hell's goin' on, hmm?

44:23.097 --> 44:26.267
Her fiancé Rick Van pelt
just so happened

44:26.300 --> 44:28.435
to stumble
through my front gate tonight.

44:32.106 --> 44:35.142
He seems to have
some odd luggage with him.

44:35.175 --> 44:36.977
Looked like your missing piece.

44:57.197 --> 44:59.566
Yes, he's still here.

44:59.601 --> 45:02.269
Yeah, he's holed up
in my guest room.

45:02.303 --> 45:05.406
Yes, I'll keep him here.

45:05.439 --> 45:06.540
Don't worry.

45:12.112 --> 45:15.416
Oh, Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, Ricky.

45:35.336 --> 45:38.005
Well, don't wait too long
to send out your dog.

45:38.038 --> 45:39.940
The dog will be there.

45:55.055 --> 45:57.391
Hey!

45:57.424 --> 45:58.892
Give me a sec.

46:01.528 --> 46:04.164
Hey, uh, what's up, man?

46:04.198 --> 46:07.669
I... I was just...
Just about to go to sleep.

46:07.702 --> 46:09.903
Yeah, sorry,
I was just checkin' on you.

46:09.937 --> 46:11.972
Makin' sure
you got yourself settled.

46:12.005 --> 46:15.209
I couldn't quite seem
to fall asleep.

46:15.242 --> 46:17.144
I... is everything okay
out there?

46:17.177 --> 46:19.146
I... I thought
I heard some voices earlier.

46:19.179 --> 46:21.081
No, that was probably
those drunken lovebirds

46:21.115 --> 46:22.516
down the hall.

46:22.549 --> 46:25.018
I can go and tell 'em
to shut their yappers

46:25.052 --> 46:26.162
if they're keepin' you awake.

46:26.186 --> 46:27.554
No! No.

46:33.160 --> 46:37.464
Well, on that note
I'll leave you be,

46:37.498 --> 46:42.002
but uh, if you wanna catch up
or if you want a nightcap,

46:42.035 --> 46:44.304
like I said,
I'm just down the hall.

46:44.338 --> 46:46.039
Not sleeping.

46:52.012 --> 46:53.480
All right.

47:02.022 --> 47:04.291
Come on, man, fuckin' pick up.

47:04.324 --> 47:06.126
Pick up.

47:06.761 --> 47:08.295
Hey.

47:08.328 --> 47:11.398
Hey, it's me, it's Rick.
Call me back.

47:11.432 --> 47:13.668
Jimmy, call me back.

49:52.894 --> 49:54.361
Found this in the room.

49:59.867 --> 50:01.511
Well, at least, you don't
have to do that shit here.

50:01.535 --> 50:03.705
That would have been a bummer.

50:03.738 --> 50:05.172
Like for me.

52:23.477 --> 52:24.946
Let's talk.

52:27.380 --> 52:29.717
Um...

52:29.751 --> 52:32.820
This uh, idea of yours...

52:35.322 --> 52:37.457
- Mmhmm.
- Yeah.

52:42.997 --> 52:44.799
What if...

52:47.501 --> 52:48.970
We just left?

52:53.641 --> 52:54.742
Left?

52:56.010 --> 52:57.511
Left?

52:57.544 --> 52:59.546
In a couple of weeks,

52:59.579 --> 53:04.852
I'll have an off-the-market
Conrad Wilhelm and...

53:09.991 --> 53:12.292
I'm gonna have Oscar's money.

53:16.496 --> 53:17.531
So...

53:21.002 --> 53:22.335
What if...

53:27.708 --> 53:29.677
So...

53:29.710 --> 53:30.477
So just... what?

53:30.510 --> 53:32.412
Like fuck the deal?

53:32.445 --> 53:34.381
Yeah.

53:34.414 --> 53:37.985
Fuck them and fuck Rick.

53:39.954 --> 53:45.026
Well, val, I'm the team captain,
I can't just like disappear.

53:47.128 --> 53:49.697
Sorry to tell you this, Isaac,
but he's cutting you.

53:54.135 --> 53:56.871
That was one fuckin' race!

53:56.904 --> 53:58.438
We came in third!

53:58.471 --> 53:59.591
We were still on the podium.

54:03.611 --> 54:06.781
Rick wants to win at all costs.

54:06.814 --> 54:07.925
And he's taking it out
on you now,

54:07.949 --> 54:10.450
and he's been taking it out
on me since the injury.

54:10.483 --> 54:14.121
This is the way out,

54:16.489 --> 54:17.291
for both of us.

54:17.325 --> 54:19.459
I need a moment
to think about it.

54:19.492 --> 54:21.428
That's a lot to take in.

54:32.740 --> 54:34.642
You're fucking crazy.

54:34.675 --> 54:36.077
Yeah, hmm.

54:45.152 --> 54:46.888
Fuck you.

54:49.156 --> 54:51.558
I've been workin'.

54:51.591 --> 54:54.427
My boys got a lead.

54:54.461 --> 54:58.565
They're over there right now
shaking 'em down,

54:58.598 --> 55:00.001
but he ain't talkin'.

55:00.034 --> 55:02.036
No, no, no, no.

55:02.069 --> 55:07.141
Forgive me if I have my doubts
about you and your associates,

55:07.174 --> 55:10.945
but I have gone past
being patient.

55:10.978 --> 55:12.680
My guys are gonna do
what they do.

55:12.713 --> 55:15.149
Roid rage is not going
to solve our problem.

55:15.182 --> 55:16.516
Better watch your mouth,
old man.

55:16.549 --> 55:19.787
Roid rage is for fools!

55:19.820 --> 55:20.988
Don't fuck with us!

55:21.022 --> 55:22.757
For fools!

55:22.790 --> 55:24.134
You're gonna end up drawing
more attention

55:24.158 --> 55:26.593
to everyone involved!

55:26.627 --> 55:29.562
Talk soon, asshole.

56:25.820 --> 56:27.688
You lyin' sack of shit.

57:22.710 --> 57:24.645
Come on, jimbo,
don't make us spend all night

57:24.678 --> 57:25.746
helping you remember shit.

57:25.780 --> 57:27.081
You know, I've got adhd.

57:27.114 --> 57:28.349
I... I swear to god,

57:28.382 --> 57:30.718
I don't fucking know
where he is.

57:30.751 --> 57:32.585
I can't give any other answer
than the truth.

57:32.620 --> 57:34.587
Don't make me ask you again,
motherfucker.

58:01.282 --> 58:02.817
What do you want?

58:05.686 --> 58:08.255
I swear on my fucking life
I do not know where Rick is,

58:08.289 --> 58:10.724
and I do not know who they are,
nor who you are,

58:10.758 --> 58:12.693
nor who sent you, nor why.

58:14.095 --> 58:16.697
Just please know I had nothing
the fuck to do with this.

58:38.219 --> 58:40.221
You can...
You can set that anywhere.

58:40.254 --> 58:42.656
You can...

58:48.863 --> 58:53.234
Uh, please don't harm me.

58:53.267 --> 58:55.102
I'm a medical professional.

58:55.136 --> 58:57.938
I'm just a common...
Just a... I'm a doctor.

59:00.107 --> 59:01.842
I'm a therapist.

59:01.876 --> 59:05.146
Just please spare me my life.

59:06.380 --> 59:08.149
Um, I... I...

59:10.317 --> 59:11.852
No.

59:18.459 --> 59:20.027
<i>Hey, Jimmy.</i>

59:20.060 --> 59:21.428
<i>Jimmy, pick up.</i>

59:21.462 --> 59:23.230
<i>Answer your phone!</i>

59:23.264 --> 59:23.898
Fuck are you, man?

59:23.931 --> 59:26.433
I... look, I need your help.

59:28.335 --> 59:30.771
<i>That...
That thing that's after me,</i>

59:30.804 --> 59:33.841
<i>I don't fucking know it,
alright?</i>

59:33.874 --> 59:37.411
It's the freakiest shit
I've ever fuckin' seen.

59:37.444 --> 59:39.246
<i>He shot my fuckin' car,</i>

59:39.280 --> 59:42.283
he was chasing me
on a fuckin' motorcycle.

59:42.316 --> 59:43.918
I don't know, I...

59:43.951 --> 59:45.419
<i>Uh, I got lucky.</i>

59:45.452 --> 59:48.455
<i>I... I f... I fuckin' lost him.
I... I don't know.</i>

59:48.489 --> 59:50.391
<i>I think I found
a couple of hotels a...</i>

59:50.424 --> 59:55.496
A few miles off the interstate
just west of town.

59:55.529 --> 59:59.400
Listen to me, you come out here
when you get this,

59:59.433 --> 1:00:03.070
and I'll... I'll let you know
where I am.

1:00:03.103 --> 1:00:05.806
I... I... I can't find my phone.

1:00:05.839 --> 1:00:07.050
I don't know, I fuckin' lost it.

1:00:07.074 --> 1:00:08.776
I'll find you.

1:00:08.809 --> 1:00:10.945
Just get out here.

1:00:10.978 --> 1:00:12.379
<i>Hopefully, I'll see you soon.</i>

1:00:12.413 --> 1:00:14.481
<i>I don't know.
Just... look, be careful.</i>

1:00:14.515 --> 1:00:16.884
<i>I don't fuckin' know.</i>

1:00:16.917 --> 1:00:18.085
He could be comin' for you.

1:00:18.118 --> 1:00:21.021
Just... just be careful, man,
please.

1:00:39.340 --> 1:00:41.242
Jesus fucking Christ.

1:00:47.081 --> 1:00:48.148
Oh, damn it!

1:01:04.398 --> 1:01:06.467
What can I do for you?

1:01:06.500 --> 1:01:09.937
Hey, boss,
uh, you got any rooms?

1:01:09.970 --> 1:01:11.372
We got those.

1:01:11.405 --> 1:01:13.307
Okay, alright.

1:01:13.340 --> 1:01:15.909
Uh, you have...
Do you have anything private

1:01:15.943 --> 1:01:16.944
down on the end?

1:01:18.479 --> 1:01:19.947
It's 55 a night.

1:01:23.083 --> 1:01:24.852
Do-do-do-do.

1:01:27.421 --> 1:01:29.223
Yeah.

1:01:29.256 --> 1:01:31.292
Here's your key.

1:01:31.325 --> 1:01:32.325
Here.

1:01:34.028 --> 1:01:35.329
Keep the change.

1:01:35.362 --> 1:01:36.297
Thank you.

1:01:36.330 --> 1:01:38.032
Where am I goin'?

1:01:38.065 --> 1:01:41.402
It's on the end, like you asked.

1:01:41.435 --> 1:01:42.803
Alright.

1:02:04.525 --> 1:02:07.361
Yeah uh, hello,
I need to report three...

1:02:07.394 --> 1:02:12.099
No, uh, four murderers murdered.

1:02:13.534 --> 1:02:14.602
Thank you.

1:03:28.976 --> 1:03:30.511
Four dead goons.

1:03:32.146 --> 1:03:34.214
A gun registered in his name.

1:03:37.251 --> 1:03:39.520
A ghost killer with no eyes.

1:03:41.989 --> 1:03:44.029
It don't look too
fucking good for your friend, doc.

1:03:44.491 --> 1:03:45.559
Let alone real.

1:03:48.595 --> 1:03:49.930
A lot of people died tonight.

1:04:00.307 --> 1:04:02.109
Let's face it,
we both know it isn't Rick.

1:04:03.377 --> 1:04:05.145
We do both know that, right?

1:04:07.047 --> 1:04:08.047
You saw him?

1:04:10.317 --> 1:04:13.153
Well, nobody seems
to wanna believe me, but yeah.

1:04:13.621 --> 1:04:14.621
Yeah, I saw him.

1:04:15.389 --> 1:04:18.992
I've seen him, too,
a couple of times.

1:04:19.794 --> 1:04:20.794
Scary fucker.

1:04:24.531 --> 1:04:26.400
You should have Rick call me,
we should meet,

1:04:26.433 --> 1:04:28.244
'cause right now,
I'm the only one on his side.

1:04:28.268 --> 1:04:30.705
The evidence is pilin' up
and we both know

1:04:30.738 --> 1:04:32.683
that the law isn't
the only thing chasin' his tail.

1:04:32.707 --> 1:04:33.707
I uh.

1:04:36.310 --> 1:04:37.712
I think I know
where Rick might be.

1:04:39.614 --> 1:04:41.048
We shouldn't go alone, though.

1:04:41.081 --> 1:04:42.149
Why is that?

1:04:42.182 --> 1:04:42.983
Because that freak in there

1:04:43.016 --> 1:04:44.194
heard the answering machine
message.

1:04:44.218 --> 1:04:46.362
I was sittin' in a chair with...
He had a gun to my head

1:04:46.386 --> 1:04:47.755
and what was I supposed to do?

1:04:47.789 --> 1:04:48.690
I...

1:04:48.723 --> 1:04:50.424
Well, I wanna get
this spooky fuck in cuffs

1:04:50.457 --> 1:04:51.592
before the sun comes up.

1:04:51.626 --> 1:04:53.026
If we have company, so be it.

1:04:54.127 --> 1:04:55.630
It's a really shitty motel.

1:05:02.637 --> 1:05:04.071
Did he just take the witness?

1:05:20.554 --> 1:05:21.554
What?

1:05:24.091 --> 1:05:25.125
Nothin'.

1:05:25.526 --> 1:05:26.604
No one can have that look
on their face

1:05:26.628 --> 1:05:27.748
and not be thinkin' nothin'.

1:05:29.129 --> 1:05:30.929
I'm just thinkin'
about all the possibilities.

1:05:32.399 --> 1:05:34.669
What possibilities?

1:05:36.704 --> 1:05:38.305
How Rick got himself
into all this shit.

1:05:39.540 --> 1:05:40.784
I mean
I'm a psychologist and all,

1:05:40.808 --> 1:05:42.576
but some people are just fucked.

1:06:20.247 --> 1:06:23.417
Hey, boss, I uh,
I got a favor to ask.

1:06:24.351 --> 1:06:25.753
Sure, friend,
what can I do for you?

1:06:29.791 --> 1:06:36.363
I'm in... I'm in kinda
unique sort of trouble.

1:06:36.396 --> 1:06:38.633
I mean i'm...
I'm goin' out on a limb

1:06:38.666 --> 1:06:40.367
even asking you.

1:06:40.400 --> 1:06:45.405
But all my friends, I...
I thought I could count on...

1:06:46.540 --> 1:06:50.544
Well, they just left me fuckin'
high and dry, man.

1:06:52.412 --> 1:06:53.480
My experience?

1:06:54.849 --> 1:06:57.619
Friends are hard to come by
this time of the night,

1:06:57.652 --> 1:06:59.721
especially out here
in the middle of nowhere.

1:07:03.557 --> 1:07:07.594
So um, what is it you need?

1:07:09.731 --> 1:07:11.331
I'm happy you asked.

1:07:12.834 --> 1:07:17.170
Do you uh, wanna be friends?

1:07:20.240 --> 1:07:21.876
If anybody comes here

1:07:23.410 --> 1:07:27.882
asking, looking,
anything for Rick Van pelt,

1:07:28.415 --> 1:07:29.751
you don't know nothin'.

1:07:30.918 --> 1:07:31.918
And you call my room.

1:07:32.820 --> 1:07:35.255
Oh, it's easy enough.

1:07:35.857 --> 1:07:36.858
Happy to help.

1:07:37.324 --> 1:07:38.425
Great.

1:07:39.994 --> 1:07:43.330
Oh, hey, I can't lie to the cops

1:07:43.931 --> 1:07:45.399
if they come sniffin' around.

1:07:47.602 --> 1:07:50.237
Hey, not worried about the cops.

1:07:50.270 --> 1:07:51.405
Oh.

1:07:51.438 --> 1:07:52.740
Oh, okay.

1:07:53.041 --> 1:07:54.508
You take care now.

1:08:02.482 --> 1:08:04.551
Yeah!

1:08:04.584 --> 1:08:06.954
That's right,
you solve that puzzle.

1:08:06.988 --> 1:08:09.222
Oh, shit.

1:08:09.256 --> 1:08:11.458
Abracadabra,
that's a hell of a board.

1:08:13.795 --> 1:08:14.795
Uh.

1:08:16.030 --> 1:08:17.030
Uh.

1:09:00.908 --> 1:09:02.509
Morning, val.

1:09:02.542 --> 1:09:04.645
Or uh,
should I say "late night"?

1:09:04.679 --> 1:09:05.780
Funny.

1:09:07.581 --> 1:09:08.581
No.

1:09:09.349 --> 1:09:10.450
Not really.

1:09:13.353 --> 1:09:18.826
Um, I'm serious, where...
Where were you last night?

1:09:18.860 --> 1:09:20.962
I mean I...
I tried to find you all night.

1:09:22.830 --> 1:09:24.766
Conrad had a group of investors
at the museum.

1:09:24.799 --> 1:09:26.333
I had to work late.

1:09:30.004 --> 1:09:31.004
Really?

1:09:32.640 --> 1:09:34.642
Because I sent Jimmy
to the gallery

1:09:34.675 --> 1:09:36.309
and all the lights were off.

1:09:40.782 --> 1:09:43.818
Wow, fucking psycho.

1:09:45.953 --> 1:09:47.587
We went out afterwards.

1:09:50.357 --> 1:09:51.391
Why don't you trust me?

1:09:55.562 --> 1:09:57.832
You just fuckin' lie to me

1:09:59.599 --> 1:10:01.936
and this has been goin' on
for a while, hasn't it?

1:10:07.942 --> 1:10:09.409
You're holed up at this house

1:10:09.442 --> 1:10:11.612
and it's making you
fucking paranoid.

1:10:36.938 --> 1:10:38.840
Hey, hey, hey, man.

1:10:38.873 --> 1:10:40.641
You lookin' for the party, man?

1:10:40.675 --> 1:10:43.376
You lookin' for the party,
I got everything you want, bro.

1:10:43.410 --> 1:10:44.411
Uh, I'm good.

1:10:44.444 --> 1:10:45.545
Where you goin'?

1:10:45.579 --> 1:10:47.114
Where you goin'?

1:10:47.148 --> 1:10:49.951
Fuckin'
warlock-lookin' motherfucker.

1:11:00.127 --> 1:11:01.127
Fuck.

1:11:03.097 --> 1:11:05.833
Fuckin' phone, Jesus Christ.

1:11:08.703 --> 1:11:10.437
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, man!

1:11:10.470 --> 1:11:12.940
You in my neighborhood,
I'm tryin' to talk to you!

1:11:12.974 --> 1:11:14.651
I asked if you're lookin'
for the party, man.

1:11:14.675 --> 1:11:15.686
I don't want a party, okay?

1:11:15.710 --> 1:11:16.987
Come on, hey, hey,
you ain't got to be scared,

1:11:17.011 --> 1:11:18.545
you ain't got to be scared!

1:11:18.578 --> 1:11:19.957
- Oh! Oh!
- Fuckin' listen to me now!

1:11:19.981 --> 1:11:23.483
I'm tryin' to help you out,
motherfucker!

1:11:23.516 --> 1:11:25.095
I just want some change.
I just want some fuckin' change.

1:11:25.119 --> 1:11:26.621
Okay, okay.

1:11:26.654 --> 1:11:27.898
Look, look, we...
We can work this out.

1:11:27.922 --> 1:11:29.790
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna grab my wallet.

1:11:29.824 --> 1:11:31.101
I'm gonna give you
everything I have, okay?

1:11:31.125 --> 1:11:33.027
- What you got?
- We can work this out, okay?

1:11:33.060 --> 1:11:34.695
- Let's work it out.
- Okay.

1:11:34.729 --> 1:11:37.765
Don't fuckin'... don't you
fuckin' fuck with me now.

1:11:37.798 --> 1:11:39.734
What you got there?
Let me see it.

1:11:39.767 --> 1:11:41.534
Fat stacks. Let me see it.

1:11:41.568 --> 1:11:43.771
Oh, oh yeah.
Fuckin' rich boy Jaycee...

1:12:56.610 --> 1:12:58.646
If it's safe and I need you,
I'll call you.

1:13:00.982 --> 1:13:02.116
Jesus, Rick.

1:13:02.850 --> 1:13:03.850
You got that?

1:13:08.289 --> 1:13:10.691
If you see anything,
fucking call me, please.

1:13:58.739 --> 1:13:59.640
Lookin' for a guy,

1:13:59.673 --> 1:14:01.233
would have checked in
the last 24 hours.

1:14:02.676 --> 1:14:05.212
Gray hair, beard,
camo head to toe.

1:14:09.917 --> 1:14:12.086
God, damn it.

1:14:14.622 --> 1:14:15.623
What?

1:14:52.359 --> 1:14:54.628
Yep, he's here.

1:14:54.662 --> 1:14:55.830
Room 20, down on the end.

1:14:55.863 --> 1:14:56.863
Thanks.

1:14:58.432 --> 1:14:59.910
Holy shit, thanks
and get out of here,

1:14:59.934 --> 1:15:00.935
fuckin' cop.

1:16:24.785 --> 1:16:26.153
Jimmy!

1:16:26.187 --> 1:16:29.190
Rick, I thought you got shot.

1:16:31.458 --> 1:16:33.327
M... m... Morrison.

1:16:33.360 --> 1:16:35.829
He knows
where this all leads, Rick.

1:16:35.863 --> 1:16:37.198
He knows.

1:16:37.231 --> 1:16:39.066
I gotta go do this on my own.

1:16:39.099 --> 1:16:40.734
I gotta stay with the car!

1:17:49.870 --> 1:17:53.007
Stop fuckin' runnin' away
and listen to me, asshole.

1:17:53.040 --> 1:17:54.184
- Do you know what...
- Shut the hell up

1:17:54.208 --> 1:17:55.943
if you wanna get out
of here alive.

1:17:55.976 --> 1:17:58.178
10 years now,
Wilhelm's phantom killer

1:17:58.212 --> 1:18:00.056
has been knockin' off
every high-profile witness,

1:18:00.080 --> 1:18:02.516
gangster, you name it,
but he doesn't exist.

1:18:02.549 --> 1:18:04.418
There's not a shred of evidence,

1:18:04.451 --> 1:18:07.021
and I may not have another shot
to catch this fucker alive.

1:18:08.589 --> 1:18:09.857
Huh?

1:18:11.025 --> 1:18:13.169
- Do you think I wanted to be...
- What did I just say?

1:18:13.193 --> 1:18:14.995
Shut the fuck up, alright?

1:18:15.029 --> 1:18:16.864
We need to be smarter than him.

1:18:16.897 --> 1:18:18.999
We gotta keep moving, alright?

1:18:19.033 --> 1:18:21.035
We need to fuckin' move, now.

1:18:29.910 --> 1:18:33.447
Fuck, can't... can't you just
call for backup?

1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:35.582
No, man,
because he's a fuckin' ghost.

1:18:35.617 --> 1:18:37.951
If he gets spooked,
poof, he's gone.

1:18:37.985 --> 1:18:39.665
And then guess
who this all gets pinned on?

1:18:41.188 --> 1:18:42.856
What the fuck?

1:18:42.890 --> 1:18:45.359
Are you... I mean what's your...
What's your plan?

1:18:45.392 --> 1:18:47.361
Why are we still hiding?
You're a fuckin' cop!

1:18:47.394 --> 1:18:50.064
I don't exactly do things
by the book.

1:18:50.097 --> 1:18:51.865
What is that supposed to mean?

1:18:51.899 --> 1:18:53.300
- It means you're the bait.
- No.

1:18:53.334 --> 1:18:54.301
- Yeah.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1:18:54.335 --> 1:18:56.638
You know, he's been chasing me
all... all day.

1:18:56.671 --> 1:18:58.572
Uh, my knee I c... I can't...

1:18:58.606 --> 1:19:00.274
Exactly, you're leaking.

1:19:01.508 --> 1:19:03.877
He'll go exactly
where we need him to, alright?

1:19:03.911 --> 1:19:05.488
Now, there's a concrete plant
just north of here.

1:19:05.512 --> 1:19:06.947
I want you to go there
and meet me.

1:19:08.282 --> 1:19:10.284
You're fuckin' insane.

1:19:10.317 --> 1:19:12.152
Do you want to fuckin' die?

1:19:12.186 --> 1:19:13.655
Go.

1:23:56.570 --> 1:23:57.570
Bravo.

1:23:58.940 --> 1:24:00.808
You tightened up
another loose end.

1:24:02.209 --> 1:24:03.778
Too bad about Oscar.

1:24:05.880 --> 1:24:07.682
Oscar was an idiot.

1:24:09.751 --> 1:24:10.751
You.

1:24:13.453 --> 1:24:17.925
You have been
my greatest investment.

1:24:19.559 --> 1:24:21.829
My greatest achievement.

1:24:24.899 --> 1:24:26.668
The sun will be up
in a few minutes.

1:24:27.902 --> 1:24:28.902
End it.

1:24:31.271 --> 1:24:32.271
End it.

1:24:32.974 --> 1:24:34.441
End it!

1:25:30.497 --> 1:25:32.532
Find the truth in the night.

1:27:45.599 --> 1:27:47.835
Hmm, I smell blood.

1:27:49.436 --> 1:27:51.639
I hope they didn't put up
too much of a fight.

1:27:57.812 --> 1:28:02.149
You know,
things got unnecessarily messy.

1:28:03.618 --> 1:28:04.618
Ugly.

1:28:05.518 --> 1:28:07.788
Man, who can you trust?

1:28:13.661 --> 1:28:15.528
Well, here, I... let...
Let me see.

1:28:19.233 --> 1:28:22.502
I hope with all the commotion,
it didn't lose any value.

1:28:22.535 --> 1:28:24.605
I certainly will be able
to find another buyer.

1:30:17.985 --> 1:30:21.155
Uh, fuck, man.

1:30:21.188 --> 1:30:22.923
H... how much for the car?

1:30:22.957 --> 1:30:27.161
Well, it was um...
It's 150 for the tire,

1:30:27.194 --> 1:30:30.664
but I think I deserve a bonus.

1:30:43.277 --> 1:30:44.277
There you go.

1:30:45.112 --> 1:30:46.112
How's that?

1:30:47.848 --> 1:30:48.883
That should cover it.

1:30:51.752 --> 1:30:52.753
Look, man, um...

1:30:55.156 --> 1:30:57.291
I'm... i'm...
I'm sorry about all this.

1:31:01.395 --> 1:31:03.030
I don't know
when I'll see you next,

1:31:03.064 --> 1:31:05.132
I don't know where I'm goin'.

1:31:05.166 --> 1:31:07.735
Probably south.

1:31:08.936 --> 1:31:11.672
Well, be safe, buddy.

1:31:12.673 --> 1:31:13.974
We'll get you back.

1:31:14.875 --> 1:31:15.875
Peace out.

1:31:20.748 --> 1:31:21.748
Yeah.

1:31:22.249 --> 1:31:23.249
Go.
