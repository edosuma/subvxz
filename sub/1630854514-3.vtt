00:04.107 --> 00:05.693
GOSSIP GIRL

00:07.027 --> 00:09.529
Good evening, followers.

00:09.529 --> 00:12.700
For those who might have been
living under a rock,

00:12.700 --> 00:17.370
maybe you haven't heard:
There's a new Queen of Constance.

00:17.370 --> 00:20.540
Over a million views and counting
on your last four TikToks.

00:20.540 --> 00:23.459
Tega reacted
and Lil Huddy parodied you.

00:23.459 --> 00:26.297
"Besting" is spreading faster
than chlamydia through Tisch.

00:26.297 --> 00:28.424
Still no response from Julien?

00:28.424 --> 00:32.760
But at least there's nothing about your
mom's grade-buying scandal either.

00:32.760 --> 00:34.596
You've bested even that.

00:34.596 --> 00:37.932
If Julien isn't coming for me, my reign
will be as boring as hers was.

00:37.932 --> 00:41.394
That's why you need a romantic interest
with which to share your throne

00:41.394 --> 00:43.272
and cause immaculate
pain to on a daily basis.

00:43.272 --> 00:45.857
Candidate number one is ready
to meet if you are.

00:49.153 --> 00:52.488
- Hi, I'm Skylar.
- You're B.G. until I upgrade you.

00:52.488 --> 00:54.491
Skylar Goodwin,
13,000 followers.

00:54.491 --> 00:57.494
She's a senior at Spence, lacrosse
captain, student body vice president...

00:57.494 --> 00:59.663
No, too on the nose. Swipe left.

01:08.713 --> 01:10.758
Can you believe it?
Our first public date.

01:10.758 --> 01:13.551
Not a hotel fuck
or a vestibule duck in days.

01:13.969 --> 01:15.762
Those weren't all bad.

01:15.762 --> 01:17.638
Hey, Stacey.
My usual table, please.

01:17.638 --> 01:19.683
- Sorry, Max. We're booked up.
- Excuse me?

01:19.683 --> 01:22.728
- Maybe next time, try Resy?
- Did you just Resy me?

01:22.728 --> 01:26.398
- We'll go somewhere else.
- Yeah. Let's go.

01:26.398 --> 01:28.984
Which brings men to a question
for all of you.

01:28.984 --> 01:32.738
Who are you now that things have
been turned inside out?

01:32.738 --> 01:37.409
Let's make a carbonaran like
the Roman gods intended.

01:37.409 --> 01:41.537
Ingredients... The classic carbonara
has no cream.

01:41.537 --> 01:44.957
It's egg, cheese, and a type of bacon
called guanciale.

01:46.834 --> 01:49.922
Okay. I may have
undercooked it a little bit,

01:49.922 --> 01:52.340
so I hope
you like doughy over dente.

01:53.841 --> 01:55.760
The pasta's not the only thing
that's doughy.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.596
You've cooked every night this week.
The effort hasn't gone unnoticed.

02:01.183 --> 02:04.769
Davis: We need to talk about
Julien's sleeping arrangements.

02:04.769 --> 02:07.064
I'm just glad I actually get
cooking videos again

02:07.064 --> 02:10.066
after my For You page
was contaminated with deHaanTok.

02:16.614 --> 02:18.492
She should have the bigger room.

02:18.492 --> 02:21.161
That's Zoya's room
and Julien doesn't mind.

02:21.703 --> 02:23.079
Everything okay?

02:27.083 --> 02:29.086
Davis: I'm the one that minds.

02:29.086 --> 02:30.754
Nick: I'll figure something out.

02:31.212 --> 02:33.841
Yeah. Sorry.
Just... work stuff.

02:33.841 --> 02:36.467
I have a huge court case
in the morning.

02:40.471 --> 02:43.599
HOW SHE WORE IT
HOW I WORE IT

02:45.393 --> 02:49.272
Monet's "Who Wore It?" TikToks are
now officially a trend called "besting."

02:49.272 --> 02:50.524
She does look good.

02:50.524 --> 02:53.735
Are you really going to keep playing
pacifist while Rome burns?

02:53.735 --> 02:56.363
I'm taking the high road. There's
no such thing as a one-sided war.

02:56.363 --> 02:57.905
Tell that to the Romans.

02:57.905 --> 03:03.162
But don't worry, Julien. Imitation
is the sincerest form of battery.

03:05.122 --> 03:06.706
Only two more days together.

03:06.706 --> 03:09.585
I'll fly up from the campaign trail
as soon as I can.

03:09.585 --> 03:12.920
All I have to do is stand
and smile by my mom, anyways.

03:13.546 --> 03:16.049
Maybe I could sneak
a hologram of myself in.

03:16.467 --> 03:19.677
Obie! And Grace.
It's so nice to see you.

03:20.845 --> 03:23.222
We're at our usual spot
if you wanna join.

03:23.222 --> 03:27.019
- Feels like forever...
- We're just gonna go hang by the bar.

03:27.019 --> 03:33.609
And after all, a new world order
only means one thing, new problems.

03:33.609 --> 03:36.361
- That was weird, right?
- Understandably.

03:36.361 --> 03:39.698
We got her wasted and put her meltdown
on every platform we could find.

03:39.698 --> 03:42.409
Which is exactly what you need
to be doing to Monet.

03:42.409 --> 03:46.454
Devalue that currency, girl.
Everyone is looking to you to respond.

03:46.788 --> 03:48.289
Dakota even talked about it
on Drew.

03:48.289 --> 03:50.792
I don't care about some fake war
with a fake rival.

03:50.792 --> 03:54.713
What I care about are my friends
and mending those relationships,

03:54.713 --> 03:57.799
including Obie. And Grace.

03:57.799 --> 04:00.552
It would be easier to stop
the polar ice caps from melting.

04:00.552 --> 04:01.887
You wanna do that next?

04:01.887 --> 04:03.763
You didn't have
to make it awkward.

04:03.763 --> 04:06.225
Look, just because
she apologized for what she did

04:06.225 --> 04:08.018
does not mean
that I'm ready to forgive her.

04:08.018 --> 04:12.481
So, can we talk about your mom?
I wanna make sure that she likes me.

04:12.481 --> 04:16.275
- She's going to love you.
- I wanna make a good impression.

04:16.275 --> 04:18.988
And you'll have
the perfect opportunity to.

04:18.988 --> 04:22.532
I was able to wrangle an hour of her
schedule for us to have tea with her

04:22.532 --> 04:24.909
before she's surrounded
by donors and diplomats

04:24.909 --> 04:28.621
at the big Amnesty International
fundraiser at the Guggenheim.

04:28.621 --> 04:33.835
Wherever you may have landed after
the shakeup, I hope it's on two feet.

04:33.835 --> 04:38.257
Because sources tell me
this ground won't stay stable for long.

04:40.342 --> 04:43.094
Till then, good night.
And good luck.

04:50.977 --> 04:53.314
Mike Shubin
This account is private.

05:07.660 --> 05:08.911
Dad?

05:09.245 --> 05:12.333
- Kiwi?
- How did you get in?

05:12.333 --> 05:13.791
I still have a key.

05:13.791 --> 05:16.837
And look, I made your favorite.
Banana pancakes.

05:16.837 --> 05:21.133
You didn't have any bananas,
or syrup, so I improvised.

05:21.133 --> 05:22.301
What are you doing in the city?

05:22.676 --> 05:24.677
Big textile convention
at the Javits Center.

05:24.677 --> 05:26.805
I was able to land a meeting
with a distributor

05:26.805 --> 05:29.850
who has a line on some
second-run Turkish fabric,

05:29.850 --> 05:33.227
which I can turn over
for a sweet markup.

05:33.227 --> 05:34.979
Wow. That's great, Dad.

05:34.979 --> 05:38.107
I'm sure you're busy educating
future presidents all day

05:38.107 --> 05:40.318
and becoming
the next Harper Lee at night,

05:40.318 --> 05:41.819
but any chance you can
squeeze in

05:41.819 --> 05:43.864
some Kiwi catchup time
this afternoon?

05:43.864 --> 05:46.366
Of course! Do you wanna come by
the school around 3:00?

05:46.366 --> 05:48.744
You can meet my friends,
see where I work.

05:48.744 --> 05:50.454
That sounds like a date.

05:54.666 --> 05:56.043
So good!

05:58.921 --> 06:02.465
Four-point-four-eight!
Four-point-four-eight!

06:02.465 --> 06:03.801
Is that a bad thing?

06:03.801 --> 06:06.761
- I was a 4.22 last week.
- Oh, so it's a good thing.

06:06.761 --> 06:08.721
No! Of course not.
A low rating means

06:08.721 --> 06:12.142
that they're jealous of what they picked
you up from or witnessed.

06:12.142 --> 06:17.146
Ticking up is very bad. No table
at Odeon? No comps at Dame?

06:17.146 --> 06:19.732
- Waiting in line at Ostbahnhof?
- You waited in line?

06:19.732 --> 06:22.778
See? Thank you.
She gets it. Diagnosis?

06:22.778 --> 06:25.738
Your cachet's based
on everyone's desire to fuck you.

06:25.738 --> 06:28.200
Now that you've gone
from Ã‰lite to Baby-Sitters Club,

06:28.200 --> 06:30.411
you might as well
have moved to Austin.

06:30.411 --> 06:33.539
Now that the world knows
he's in a relationship, he's boring?

06:33.539 --> 06:34.707
Exactly.

06:34.707 --> 06:36.917
Maybe you need your very own
Manhattan Maxploration.

06:36.917 --> 06:38.835
That helped me
when my image needed updating.

06:38.835 --> 06:40.586
No. No. You can't explore
a barren ground.

06:41.129 --> 06:44.048
This is absurd. But nothing
I can't fix by end of the day.

06:44.048 --> 06:45.259
How?

06:45.259 --> 06:48.928
By helping you do what you do best.
Throwing a party.

06:49.387 --> 06:52.349
A debaucherous, drug-fueled,
who's-who and who's-under-who,

06:52.349 --> 06:55.977
proving, in sheep's clothing
or out, you are still the Wolfe.

06:55.977 --> 06:58.689
You don't even have to partake.
You just have to present.

06:58.689 --> 07:01.316
From participant
to promoter is a level up.

07:03.609 --> 07:07.489
I get to meet your dad?
The man behind your origin story?

07:07.489 --> 07:10.199
The one who begat the woman
who begat a revolution?

07:10.575 --> 07:14.580
These days, he begets refurbished
furniture, but you'll love him.

07:14.580 --> 07:17.749
Everyone does. Apparently,
that gene skips a generation.

07:17.749 --> 07:19.460
Shubin's been stonewalling me

07:19.460 --> 07:21.879
ever since I sent in the tip
that got Burton fired.

07:21.879 --> 07:24.589
Speaking of, hot goss
on the new head teacher.

07:24.589 --> 07:28.426
- She's like our age.
- Which "our"? Yours or mine?

07:28.426 --> 07:30.511
Don't know. Totally crazy.

07:32.514 --> 07:36.184
- Greetings! Headmistress Duva...
- Teacher.

07:36.184 --> 07:38.353
Head Teacher Duvall.

07:38.353 --> 07:41.106
Jordan Glassberg, computer science.
I look forward to working with you.

07:41.106 --> 07:44.734
- Hi, Jordan. And you must be Kate.
- How'd you guess?

07:44.734 --> 07:47.528
Mike and I have been
friends since grad school.

07:47.528 --> 07:50.907
He's been filling me in
on where the bodies are buried.

07:53.702 --> 07:55.120
That's so good.

07:57.331 --> 07:59.916
- So, when does Tiff get in?
- This morning.

07:59.916 --> 08:03.169
She's taking the train down from
Exeter, so I guess, like, 10:00?

08:03.169 --> 08:06.297
She's the coolest friend I have.
I can't wait for you to meet her.

08:06.297 --> 08:07.590
Great! You're here.

08:08.132 --> 08:10.718
And in the middle of a conversation
with my girlfriend.

08:10.718 --> 08:13.681
That's who I was talking to. Hot
chai with vanilla sweet cream foam?

08:13.681 --> 08:16.265
My favorite order.
How'd you know?

08:16.265 --> 08:18.601
You mentioned it was
your go-to afternoon pick-me-up

08:18.601 --> 08:20.645
over New Year's Eve,
and I'm a good listener.

08:20.645 --> 08:23.649
Yeah, because you and Monet
were trying to sabotage her.

08:23.649 --> 08:26.193
- I was just...
- Let's just finish this up inside.

08:26.193 --> 08:27.735
Less... noisy.

08:29.445 --> 08:32.658
Maybe "crash and burn"
is a good place to stop.

08:32.658 --> 08:35.077
I'm getting contact basic, anyway.

08:36.245 --> 08:39.080
If she's here to stay,
as it appears she is,

08:39.080 --> 08:42.376
I need her to like me, or our entire
friend group falls apart!

08:42.376 --> 08:47.338
Look what Monet has done.
Everything's fallen apart.

08:47.338 --> 08:49.466
I'm a Met step five.
What are you?

08:49.466 --> 08:52.510
Seven.
We can't be seen together.

08:53.262 --> 08:56.848
Let me get in good with Grace,
and then I'll tackle Monet.

08:57.598 --> 09:00.226
That's right. Twelve dozen
of the Kumamoto oysters,

09:00.226 --> 09:03.564
and then six cases
of the Larson Blanc de Blancs.

09:03.564 --> 09:06.025
This is clearly
reserved seating.

09:06.025 --> 09:07.443
And this is your first warning.

09:07.443 --> 09:10.696
Three of these, and you have to use
the teacher's entrance for a month.

09:18.745 --> 09:20.456
You said you had
updates for me?

09:20.456 --> 09:23.124
Yes. We found you
the perfect candidate.

09:23.124 --> 09:25.544
Tiff Meyers.
An ambassador's daughter,

09:25.544 --> 09:27.504
a regular
on Forbes 21 Under 21,

09:27.504 --> 09:30.090
rumored dalliances
with both Jojo and Auli'i.

09:30.090 --> 09:32.258
She wrote a viral essay at 14
on renewable energy

09:32.258 --> 09:34.970
that was presented by Kamala
herself on the Senate floor.

09:34.970 --> 09:36.889
She's the power lesbian
of solar power.

09:36.889 --> 09:38.599
There's just one problem.

09:38.599 --> 09:42.519
Her best friend
is someone you know.

09:42.519 --> 09:44.395
How is that a problem?

09:50.777 --> 09:53.322
- You have a good day at school.
- See you later.

09:56.575 --> 09:57.618
Hi, Grace!

09:57.618 --> 10:00.621
I just wanted to ask if you wanted
to hang out today after school.

10:00.621 --> 10:03.624
- Mine, not yours. Do you even...
- Home school.

10:03.624 --> 10:04.749
- How lucky!
- That tracks.

10:04.749 --> 10:08.127
I wanted to know if you wanted to go
shopping with me at the same time.

10:08.127 --> 10:11.923
We haven't spoken since the whole
misunderstanding in Hudson.

10:12.341 --> 10:16.387
And I have so regretted my part
in Julien's manipulations.

10:16.387 --> 10:18.055
That was your idea, Monet. And...

10:18.055 --> 10:21.100
- But which I agreed to, so...
- Right.

10:21.100 --> 10:24.895
These are both such lovely offers.
Perhaps we can combine them?

10:25.478 --> 10:29.649
The personal shopping experience
that I booked for us at Reformation,

10:29.649 --> 10:31.527
only allows two at a time.

10:31.527 --> 10:32.986
That's too bad.

10:33.445 --> 10:35.863
Okay. I can see if,
they can expand.

10:35.863 --> 10:38.866
But please watch my back
for any fountains.

10:38.866 --> 10:40.869
I didn't push you...

10:42.245 --> 10:43.830
We'll see you at 3:00.

10:43.830 --> 10:44.957
- Great.
- Great.

10:44.957 --> 10:47.458
- Can't wait.
- Perfect.

10:47.458 --> 10:50.461
Good luck, bitch. She only has room
for one bestie,

10:50.461 --> 10:55.092
and it's going to be me.
I'll make sure of it. Girls!

10:57.052 --> 10:58.721
You want in the door tomorrow,

10:58.721 --> 11:02.598
you walk through
those doors... in this.

11:02.598 --> 11:07.354
Looks like this armistice
is armed and dangerous.

11:07.354 --> 11:11.357
What was once peace
is about to be blown to pieces.

11:11.900 --> 11:14.403
How's Operation Feed and Forgive
working out for you?

11:14.403 --> 11:18.073
I think I'm one more TikTok recipe
away from being ungrounded.

11:18.073 --> 11:21.160
So, what do you say to a celebratory
sleepover at my house?

11:21.160 --> 11:24.788
You, me, a two-person in-PJs
reading of an Alice Childress,

11:24.788 --> 11:26.998
directed by and starring me,
of course,

11:26.998 --> 11:29.834
but with occasional supporting
performances from you?

11:29.834 --> 11:32.004
Maybe we should stick
to my house?

11:32.004 --> 11:34.672
Okay, I know my dad
was kind of an asshole, but...

11:34.672 --> 11:37.925
Your dad probably isn't even
around that much right now,

11:37.925 --> 11:39.844
what with his big promotion.

11:39.844 --> 11:42.347
- Why'd you say it like that?
- Okay...

11:42.347 --> 11:45.725
Don't freak, but my dad checked with
his lawyer friend at your dad's firm,

11:45.725 --> 11:48.102
she says they haven't promoted
anyone all year.

11:48.102 --> 11:51.189
- They're in a hiring freeze.
- Wait, did you ask him to do that?

11:51.189 --> 11:53.316
Shan, my dad's not a liar.
He was on the phone all of last night

11:53.316 --> 11:55.611
preparing for a case
he's in court for right now.

11:55.611 --> 11:59.615
- I wasn't trying to start something.
- Yes, you were. And I'll finish it.

12:02.076 --> 12:04.411
- Outten and Golden.
- Hi, Bradley. This is Zoya Lott.

12:04.744 --> 12:07.539
I was wondering if you knew when my
dad was coming out of court today.

12:07.957 --> 12:10.668
No court dates today.
Your dad took the morning off.

12:10.668 --> 12:12.835
Let me transfer you to his cell.

12:20.385 --> 12:21.844
Work

12:24.347 --> 12:26.100
Nicholas!

12:26.432 --> 12:28.601
- Thanks for coming in.
- Hey.

12:29.143 --> 12:32.231
- Mr. De Haan.
- Call me Greyson.

12:32.231 --> 12:35.317
- Shall we?
- We shall. We shall.

12:37.860 --> 12:40.781
Yeah, no, it was totally crazy.
"Get out of our way!"

12:40.781 --> 12:42.658
You don't think he'd actually...

12:42.658 --> 12:45.619
Tell her you sent the tip in
that got her predecessor fired?

12:45.619 --> 12:47.037
You know him better
than we do.

12:47.037 --> 12:49.747
How well do you know him,
by the way?

12:49.747 --> 12:52.167
The only one
with job security here is you,

12:52.167 --> 12:53.793
and the only thing you care about

12:53.793 --> 12:56.213
is a one-sided rivalry
with Magic Mike?

12:56.213 --> 12:59.632
Duvall told me this morning
to "use less words,"

12:59.632 --> 13:02.177
and if I was
"always this much energy."

13:02.177 --> 13:03.428
But what do we do?

13:03.428 --> 13:05.431
Convince Mike sending in
the tip was impulsive,

13:05.431 --> 13:07.432
that you're deeply passionate
about your beliefs,

13:07.432 --> 13:09.101
and sometimes
you get carried away.

13:09.101 --> 13:12.437
He'd never believe me!
He'd see right through it!

13:12.437 --> 13:15.316
You could talk to him maybe?
Hearing it from someone else could...

13:15.316 --> 13:18.110
- Hey!
- Dad! You're early!

13:18.110 --> 13:20.696
- Jordan, Wendy.
- A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Keller.

13:20.696 --> 13:23.740
- Pleasure is mine.
- Do I seem like a lot to you?

13:23.740 --> 13:26.242
Should we grab a bite?
There's a really great halal cart...

13:26.242 --> 13:28.787
Oh! Got us a reservation
at Rosa Mexicano.

13:28.787 --> 13:30.331
Only the best for my Kiwi.

13:30.831 --> 13:33.416
Let me grab my purse.
Might be expensive.

13:33.751 --> 13:36.462
You guys will talk
to that student for me, right?

13:36.462 --> 13:39.005
You can count on us, Kiwi.

13:40.215 --> 13:44.093
Jordan...
you should use less words.

13:44.803 --> 13:48.139
"You can..."
Six words.

13:49.350 --> 13:52.018
Are you sure about the Bottega?

13:52.018 --> 13:55.188
I think your father would prefer
the Etro.

13:55.188 --> 13:57.649
Nope! No, no, no.
Hey, look, Pops is gonna love

13:57.649 --> 13:59.944
whatever you wear, I promise.
You look great!

13:59.944 --> 14:01.444
I don't know what makes me
more nervous.

14:01.444 --> 14:03.655
My first night away with your father
since the separation,

14:03.655 --> 14:05.115
or whatever's happening here.

14:05.115 --> 14:07.743
All you have
to worry about is being late.

14:07.743 --> 14:11.037
Have fun, boys. And don't...
touch the Haring.

14:11.037 --> 14:13.164
- He's been through enough.
- Okay.

14:15.584 --> 14:18.211
I'm nervous, Ak.
What if Grace's mom doesn't like me?

14:18.211 --> 14:20.005
I'd be more nervous
you won't like her.

14:20.005 --> 14:22.548
Charlotte Byron makes
the Tea Party look like...

14:22.548 --> 14:25.385
... a tea party.
Didn't she campaign for Trump?

14:25.385 --> 14:28.472
What, like your dad and my parents
would have if they were from here?

14:28.472 --> 14:32.183
Look, Grace is not like that,
all right? She's like one of us.

14:32.183 --> 14:35.311
I know you are nervous
about making a good impression.

14:35.311 --> 14:37.690
- You like Grace, and I get it.
- Yeah.

14:37.690 --> 14:41.567
Don't stress. You know if I could be
there for support, I would, all right?

14:41.567 --> 14:43.487
I get it. Your boyfriend's party
takes precedence.

14:43.487 --> 14:45.738
I think he needs you
a lot more than I do.

14:45.738 --> 14:48.534
I don't care if your cousin's
getting married.

14:48.534 --> 14:50.869
You're the only bartender
in the tri-state area

14:50.869 --> 14:51.995
who can make
a half-decent Vesper.

14:51.995 --> 14:53.788
So get your shit together
and be here by 6:00.

14:54.205 --> 14:58.626
Your ratios are all off.
If I wanted CBD, I'd go to CVS.

14:58.626 --> 15:01.879
We normally have more, but Lucas
Hedges just bought the bulk of it.

15:01.879 --> 15:03.214
He's hosting a rager
in Brooklyn Heights.

15:03.214 --> 15:06.175
We have pre-rolled joints
we can give you on discount.

15:06.175 --> 15:10.888
I can guarantee you that there's never
been a rager in Brooklyn Heights,

15:10.888 --> 15:14.559
and that pale-faced ginge wouldn't know
the difference between dank and ditch.

15:14.559 --> 15:17.980
So you can give him your mids
and me your fire,

15:17.980 --> 15:19.772
or I'll put your number
on Telegram

15:19.772 --> 15:22.483
and you'll be doing frat runs
the rest of your life.

15:22.483 --> 15:25.069
Okay. Ladies, hi.
So, I think there might be

15:25.069 --> 15:28.657
a little bit of confusion
on where you are right now.

15:28.657 --> 15:31.492
See, Mr. Wolfe has been one of
your most consistent customers.

15:31.492 --> 15:33.828
So I think whatever inventory
you're thinking of

15:33.828 --> 15:37.166
handing over to Hedges,
you can redirect.

15:41.377 --> 15:42.880
We'll pay double?

15:44.715 --> 15:45.923
- Sold.
- Sold.

15:49.969 --> 15:53.097
Only one of us is walking out
of here Grace's friend. Okay?

15:53.097 --> 15:54.850
- How does it look?
- Almost ready!

15:54.850 --> 15:57.478
We can both be. Why does everything
have to be a battle?

15:57.478 --> 15:58.896
I really like the emerald green.

15:59.354 --> 16:01.815
Do you really think
that they want puppies and hugs?

16:01.815 --> 16:04.652
No, that's for Hillary Duff.
Do you want to be dueting

16:04.652 --> 16:06.653
with your younger self
ten years from now,

16:06.653 --> 16:09.448
showcasing just how little
happened in between?

16:09.448 --> 16:12.242
Or do you wanna keep grabbing
those brass rings

16:12.242 --> 16:14.243
until you have
full fucking grills?

16:14.243 --> 16:15.828
I want neither of those things.

16:15.828 --> 16:18.665
Okay. So, when I'm done with you,
that wish will be my command.

16:18.665 --> 16:19.999
Why do you even wanna be
her friend anyway?

16:19.999 --> 16:22.920
She's not big on social media,
and her mom redistricted Virginia.

16:22.920 --> 16:27.131
Why do you? She's dating your ex.
And she's basic as fuck.

16:28.716 --> 16:31.552
I know what you're feeling.
It's a little out of your wheelhouse.

16:31.552 --> 16:34.555
- But I think you've never looked better.
- But is it me?

16:34.555 --> 16:38.394
Yeah, Julien has a tendency
to only think about herself.

16:38.394 --> 16:41.062
What about...
This is more you. Am I right?

16:41.062 --> 16:43.649
- That is so cute.
- It is. So try it on.

16:43.649 --> 16:48.653
And then we'll head over to everyone's
fave, Scotch and Soda!

17:00.790 --> 17:03.544
- You didn't answer my call.
- Excuse me? I was...

17:03.544 --> 17:05.629
- I was in court.
- Not according to your office.

17:05.629 --> 17:07.214
They said you took
the morning off.

17:07.214 --> 17:10.634
So is honesty really the best policy?
Let's find out.

17:11.092 --> 17:14.680
I didn't wanna say anything
until I was sure it was happening.

17:14.680 --> 17:18.099
The promotion just isn't enough money.
I've started looking for a new job.

17:18.099 --> 17:21.352
And I had an interview in the
employment litigation department

17:21.352 --> 17:22.687
at Debevoise and Plimpton.

17:22.687 --> 17:24.815
Dad, why didn't you
just tell me that?

17:24.815 --> 17:27.066
I'm, like, always burdening you
with bad news.

17:27.066 --> 17:29.944
So I wanted to make sure
this was solid before sharing.

17:29.944 --> 17:32.615
It's still not done,
but I'm meeting one of the partners

17:32.615 --> 17:34.782
at a charity event
at the Guggenheim tonight.

17:34.782 --> 17:38.328
Z, it's fine. We just have to be
patient with each other.

17:38.328 --> 17:41.956
Trust takes time to rebuild,
for both of us.

17:50.299 --> 17:53.510
Do you know what my favorite thing
about Kate is? Her sense of duty.

17:53.510 --> 17:57.013
Obviously, she can be intense,
but her intentions are good.

17:57.013 --> 17:59.891
Everything she does, she does
because she deeply cares.

17:59.891 --> 18:01.018
- Jordan...
- She cares so much.

18:01.018 --> 18:04.479
- Which is why she...
- She sent you to talk her up to me.

18:04.479 --> 18:06.690
- No. No, of course not.
- Yeah.

18:06.690 --> 18:10.485
- Totally and completely.
- Why am I not surprised?

18:13.863 --> 18:16.282
- What the fuck was that?
- What do you want from me?

18:16.282 --> 18:19.160
I'm a lot!
I have to save my own job too.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.746
To Kate: need a plan B

18:24.916 --> 18:27.544
- Reservation for Keller.
- Right this way.

18:27.544 --> 18:29.087
The other member of your party's
already been seated.

18:29.087 --> 18:32.341
- Other member?
- My girlfriend, Theresa.

18:32.341 --> 18:35.009
Can't wait
for my two fave girls to meet.

18:37.637 --> 18:39.098
- Hey.
- Sweetie.

18:40.473 --> 18:42.308
Here you go.

18:42.308 --> 18:46.020
How'd you know
this is my favorite?

18:46.020 --> 18:48.106
Oh, I just had a feeling.

18:48.106 --> 18:49.441
Only one bagel, though.

18:49.441 --> 18:51.401
Can't be late
to meet my mom and Obie.

18:51.401 --> 18:54.112
It's been so nice spending
the afternoon getting to know you.

18:54.112 --> 18:57.949
Your mom is super impressive.
Is it true that at the age of 25,

18:57.949 --> 18:59.784
she became the mayor
of Big Stone Gap?

18:59.784 --> 19:02.954
- You know Big Stone?
- Yeah. It's...

19:02.954 --> 19:04.581
There's a movie
called Big Stone Gap

19:04.581 --> 19:06.959
starring Ashley Judd
and Patrick Wilson.

19:06.959 --> 19:09.168
Yeah! It's...
It's one of my fave rom coms.

19:09.168 --> 19:12.630
Mine too!
Patrick Wilson is so dreamy.

19:12.630 --> 19:15.634
The dreamiest!
Obie mentioned that you used to ride.

19:16.217 --> 19:18.387
When I was younger,
my grandma had this horse...

19:18.387 --> 19:19.637
Obie didn't mention my accident?

19:19.637 --> 19:23.100
Jules! How could you forget
about Grace's accident?

19:24.184 --> 19:25.269
Found it!

19:25.269 --> 19:28.271
Sorry. Yeah. She... fell.

19:28.271 --> 19:29.898
Her favorite horse, Buttercup,
stepped on her face.

19:29.898 --> 19:34.028
...favorite horse, uh,
Buttercup, stepped on her face.

19:34.403 --> 19:37.071
I lost my front tooth
and could've died.

19:37.071 --> 19:39.867
- Never rode again.
- That's horrific.

19:39.867 --> 19:42.202
But I'm so glad
you're finding new hobbies.

19:42.202 --> 19:45.331
- You're into soap carving, right?
- She won a competition last year at...

19:45.331 --> 19:48.417
Yeah, I saw that you won
a championship... at...

19:49.710 --> 19:54.882
Gothenburg! Monet?
She hung up?

19:54.882 --> 19:57.343
- Gothenburg.
- Yeah.

19:57.717 --> 20:01.346
I love Sweden! We should do
a girls' trip to the fjords this summer.

20:01.346 --> 20:03.766
- I'd love that!
- So would I.

20:04.850 --> 20:08.853
And then... T and I
are planning a cruise to Jamaica.

20:09.354 --> 20:12.399
I gotta tell ya, she's put a spring
back into my step.

20:12.399 --> 20:15.943
And you in mine, Den.
Your father is quite the character.

20:15.943 --> 20:19.156
- Indeed he is.
- Don't you even think about it.

20:19.156 --> 20:22.200
I gotta get to my meeting.
But I want to tell you

20:22.200 --> 20:27.163
how happy it has made me
having lunch with my two girls.

20:27.955 --> 20:29.583
I will see you later.

20:32.085 --> 20:34.880
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

20:38.841 --> 20:41.011
Um... Jamaica.

20:41.011 --> 20:42.638
I know you don't know me at all,

20:42.638 --> 20:44.974
but I'm... I'm not the kind of woman
who has blinders on.

20:45.431 --> 20:49.436
He told me about his past, how hard
it was for you and your mom.

20:49.436 --> 20:52.564
But he's turned a corner, truly.

20:52.564 --> 20:54.983
He's in therapy.
Did you know that?

20:54.983 --> 20:56.193
I didn't know that.

20:57.486 --> 21:00.488
This pic of you and your
twin brother is so cute!

21:00.488 --> 21:02.491
- Are you two close, G?
-"G"?

21:02.824 --> 21:07.245
Not really. Jake and I shared a womb
for nine months, but not much else.

21:07.829 --> 21:09.914
Monet, we've been doing this
for twenty minutes.

21:09.914 --> 21:11.834
I'm already late
to meet my mom and Obie.

21:11.834 --> 21:14.503
But I'm so loving your looks.
Come on, just one more.

21:14.920 --> 21:18.340
- OMG. You know Tiff Meyers?
- She's my best friend.

21:18.340 --> 21:21.176
- I'm seeing her tonight. Why do you ask?
- What a coincidence!

21:21.176 --> 21:24.305
I have had the biggest crush
on her from afar for ages.

21:24.305 --> 21:27.348
- She's like the me of Exeter.
- That is a coincidence.

21:27.348 --> 21:29.268
Do you think
that you could introduce us?

21:29.268 --> 21:30.894
Sorry, my mee-maw taught me

21:30.894 --> 21:33.813
to never get involved
in other people's relationships.

21:33.813 --> 21:37.901
If it goes badly, you could lose
a friend. I'm sorry.

21:37.901 --> 21:40.945
Are you kidding me? I spent the entire
day pretending that you don't have

21:40.945 --> 21:44.866
the taste of a 25-year-old mom
from Tenafly, and for what?

21:44.866 --> 21:46.367
That's what you guys were doing?

21:46.868 --> 21:49.413
- You two are unbelievable.
- No, no, no! I wasn't...

21:49.413 --> 21:51.206
I had nothing to d...

21:53.124 --> 21:55.336
How lovely to be dragged down
by you again.

21:55.669 --> 21:58.921
- I'll bounce back. And faster.
- Synthetics usually do.

21:59.630 --> 22:01.592
She's waking up.

22:06.763 --> 22:13.186
Well, this party has flatlined.
Time of death, 7:32 p.m.

22:13.186 --> 22:14.312
It's early still.

22:14.312 --> 22:17.440
- Yeah, and a lot of people already came.
- Yeah, pre-game, Hope. Pre-game.

22:17.440 --> 22:21.319
They're not coming back. And worse,
my friends from Berlin are in town,

22:21.319 --> 22:24.906
and they didn't invite me to the reunion
they're apparently having without me.

22:24.906 --> 22:28.284
I mean, what, did our summer at sea
mean nothing to them?

22:31.996 --> 22:33.666
It says here that they're going

22:33.666 --> 22:37.044
to that charity event at the Guggenheim
that Grace's mom is in town for.

22:37.044 --> 22:39.545
- Yeah, so?
- So maybe we're thinking too small.

22:40.088 --> 22:42.423
I mean, why be a local sensation
when you can be a global one?

22:42.423 --> 22:44.300
I mean, if you're trying
to get your rep back up,

22:44.300 --> 22:46.512
all you need to do
is do what you do best,

22:46.512 --> 22:48.179
cross borders and boundaries.

22:53.268 --> 22:55.228
- Senator.
- Thanks.

22:55.228 --> 22:57.814
I'm a Bowman Brothers straight,
one rock, but I assumed

22:57.814 --> 23:01.902
you'd prefer a Coke
mixed with orange soda?

23:01.902 --> 23:05.698
- You know about Spezi?
- I have a great staff.

23:05.698 --> 23:09.076
Since anyone in my orbit
is under a microscope,

23:09.076 --> 23:11.954
I have to.
I know a lot about you.

23:11.954 --> 23:15.082
Anything that I should
be afraid of?

23:15.082 --> 23:18.126
- I have a strong aversion to drama.
- As you should.

23:18.126 --> 23:20.962
I'm pretty turned off
by it as well.

23:21.462 --> 23:24.508
Doesn't mean you're not still
surrounded by it.

23:24.508 --> 23:28.553
The smallest bit of scandal,
even on the periphery,

23:28.553 --> 23:30.930
can sink my reelection plans.

23:30.930 --> 23:34.935
I'm not saying I don't approve.
Your family's reputation precedes them.

23:34.935 --> 23:39.272
I'm only asking that perhaps
you keep this in mind

23:39.272 --> 23:41.357
regarding the company you keep.

23:42.443 --> 23:44.944
- Hi!
- Let's put a pin in that for now.

23:44.944 --> 23:47.113
- There you are, darling.
- I'm so sorry I'm late.

23:47.113 --> 23:50.034
We've made good use of our time
together. Haven't we, Otto?

23:50.034 --> 23:53.203
I'm glad he's accompanying us
to tonight's event.

23:54.829 --> 23:56.290
Looking good.

23:56.290 --> 24:00.002
I'll be back by 10:00.
Just gonna shake hands and pray.

24:00.002 --> 24:01.669
- Good luck.
- Bye, Z.

24:02.670 --> 24:04.297
Hey, Dad.
You forgot your...

24:16.685 --> 24:22.691
To MonetdeHaan: Your parents going
to that Amnesty Int. event tonight?

24:24.193 --> 24:27.153
Yes, and please never dm me again

24:29.990 --> 24:31.241
Uh-oh. What now?

24:31.241 --> 24:34.703
My dad made me feel crazy, like I was
wrong for assuming something.

24:34.703 --> 24:36.537
But he just lied to me again!

24:36.537 --> 24:39.083
Should we ambush him
with a polygraph machine?

24:39.083 --> 24:42.335
- I have zip ties in my bag.
- No, I have a better idea.

24:42.835 --> 24:45.505
I'm gonna go to that party thing
tonight, catch him red-handed.

24:45.505 --> 24:49.176
- I'd like to see him lie to me then.
- Good luck.

24:50.260 --> 24:54.347
You can't just play the hand
you've been dealt.

24:56.432 --> 24:59.186
AKI: got your wish, we're doing afters
at that charity event. See you there?

24:59.186 --> 25:02.273
MONET: I need a favor. You cannot
refuse. C u at the Guggenheim.

25:02.273 --> 25:06.151
GRACE: Zoya asked if she could come
tonight. I said yes. PS: mom loved you.

25:06.151 --> 25:10.614
It's Charlotte Byron. Please keep our
conversation in mind tonight. No drama.

25:11.407 --> 25:15.869
When your back's against the wall,
there's only ever one way out.

25:16.536 --> 25:19.122
You have to mount an offensive.

25:19.122 --> 25:24.043
Hey, are you busy tonight?
I need your help.

25:27.964 --> 25:30.884
Bye, bye, Byron!
Bye, bye, Byron!

25:31.427 --> 25:32.970
Is it always like this?

25:32.970 --> 25:34.305
Occupational hazard,

25:34.305 --> 25:38.641
given our mom's unpopular stances
on refugees' rights among the liberals.

25:38.641 --> 25:40.561
- Hope my sister warned you.
- Not to worry, Jake.

25:40.561 --> 25:42.228
His family deals with this
all the time.

25:42.228 --> 25:45.524
Except he's usually on the other
side of the barricades.

25:45.524 --> 25:48.152
Hey, Senator Byron. Fuck you!

25:53.115 --> 25:55.701
Bye, bye, Byron!
Bye, bye, Byron!

26:09.757 --> 26:12.718
Nice to see a friendly face.
Thank you again for doing this.

26:12.718 --> 26:16.555
Yeah, it's... quite a scene out there.
How can I help you avoid one in here?

26:16.555 --> 26:18.723
I promised Grace's mother
that there would be no drama.

26:18.723 --> 26:21.560
And of course...
Divide and conquer?

26:22.770 --> 26:26.898
All right. One more thing. I didn't tell
Grace that I invited you,

26:26.898 --> 26:29.860
just because I thought
that she might think it's weird.

26:30.611 --> 26:32.196
Don't worry, I...

26:32.529 --> 26:35.658
I'm Keisha McGuire's guest,
so her and I go way back.

26:35.658 --> 26:37.075
Thank you.

26:39.661 --> 26:41.830
Why are you here, De Haan?
And what will it take for you to leave?

26:41.830 --> 26:43.874
An introduction to your girlfriend's
friend, Tiffany Meyers,

26:43.874 --> 26:45.709
the future Lorraine
to my Habsburg.

26:45.709 --> 26:47.628
After what you pulled,
why would I do that?

26:47.628 --> 26:50.464
Because I will pull much worse,
right here, right now, if you don't.

26:50.464 --> 26:53.884
In front of everyone, including...
Who was it? Your future mother-in-law.

26:53.884 --> 26:55.344
- Look...
- What?

26:55.344 --> 26:58.346
- Just an introduction?
- That's it, king.

27:01.057 --> 27:02.476
We're clashing tones.

27:02.476 --> 27:04.270
We can't meet like this!
I'll be back in 15.

27:04.270 --> 27:06.187
- Oh, my God.
- What do you...

27:10.526 --> 27:12.569
Well, how exactly
is this gonna work?

27:12.944 --> 27:15.155
Just see and be seen
with your sea people,

27:15.155 --> 27:18.241
and everyone will be talking
about you by morning.

27:18.241 --> 27:20.284
Proximity
isn't prominence, Hope.

27:20.284 --> 27:24.331
Well, get in good with them now,
go out with them later,

27:24.331 --> 27:25.456
and give 'em a night
to remember.

27:25.456 --> 27:27.083
What's this I hear about a night
to remember?

27:27.083 --> 27:29.837
- Jules, what are you doing here?
- I'm a guest of a guest.

27:29.837 --> 27:32.547
And my host wouldn't really like it
if things got out of hand,

27:32.547 --> 27:34.674
so could the pocket pharmacy
close for tonight?

27:34.674 --> 27:37.428
This is supposed to be
a dignified affair.

27:38.594 --> 27:40.180
All yours.

27:40.180 --> 27:42.641
I cannot believe that you just handed
those to her.

27:42.641 --> 27:46.020
I can't believe you think
I'd still keep my stash in there

27:46.020 --> 27:48.022
after that Rafa incident.

27:48.814 --> 27:50.649
Jules? Wait, you're here?

27:50.649 --> 27:53.736
This is an event.
I go to events. You do not.

27:53.736 --> 27:55.445
Why did you ask Grace
to get you in?

27:55.445 --> 27:57.656
My dad lied to me.
So I'm gonna catch him in the act,

27:57.656 --> 27:59.407
make sure
he doesn't do it again.

27:59.407 --> 28:01.951
Okay. Do you really think
that this is the place for that?

28:01.951 --> 28:05.413
This isn't a debutante ball
or a school fundraiser.

28:05.413 --> 28:07.082
Look around.

28:08.041 --> 28:10.961
This is politics.
The stakes are...

28:10.961 --> 28:12.754
- Jules.
- Obie?

28:12.754 --> 28:14.756
- Have you seen Zoya?
- Have you seen Monet?

28:15.215 --> 28:16.508
This is exhausting!

28:16.508 --> 28:18.802
Yeah. Now you know
how I always feel.

28:20.053 --> 28:23.431
Dad?
What happened to your key?

28:26.101 --> 28:28.270
You owe me an explanation.

28:29.854 --> 28:33.816
My dad is in town for a textile
convention and he has a key?

28:33.816 --> 28:37.195
No, an explanation for why you sent
your minions to sweet-talk me.

28:37.195 --> 28:39.198
- How do you know where I live?
- It's on the contact list.

28:39.198 --> 28:41.492
Don't change the subject.
What are you so afraid of?

28:41.492 --> 28:44.035
- That I'll tattle on ya?
- Yes! Of course, I'm afraid!

28:44.035 --> 28:47.456
I thought I was doing the right thing,
and only you know I did it,

28:47.456 --> 28:49.541
and you haven't talked to me
since I've done it, so...

28:49.541 --> 28:51.710
So, what do you want from me?

28:53.419 --> 28:56.506
I'm sorry, I wouldn't usually answer
an unknown number, but I...

28:56.506 --> 28:58.341
But you're gonna
use it to stall?

29:02.054 --> 29:06.016
I understand. Yeah.
I can be there in 15 minutes.

29:07.810 --> 29:09.811
- And now I have to go.
- Sure you do.

29:09.811 --> 29:11.396
- It's my dad.
- Sure it is.

29:11.396 --> 29:14.066
- Don't believe me? Come with.
- Fine, I will.

29:15.651 --> 29:18.695
To Jordan:
can you handle GG for me tonight?

29:26.829 --> 29:30.081
- Maximus. What are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same.

29:30.081 --> 29:33.209
If memory serves, you weren't coming
stateside till summer.

29:33.209 --> 29:36.755
Ale, this is my boyfriend, Aki,
and my girlfriend, Audrey.

29:36.755 --> 29:38.549
Spreading the love as usual,
I see.

29:38.549 --> 29:40.299
Audge, Ak, these are my friends

29:40.299 --> 29:43.304
from my endless COVID summer
on the Azimut in the Aegean.

29:43.304 --> 29:45.179
- EnchantÃ©.
- Nice to meet you all.

29:45.179 --> 29:46.556
I've heard a lot about you.

29:46.556 --> 29:48.933
Max, didn't you say you made
some amazing memories on that trip?

29:48.933 --> 29:51.019
From what little
I remember, yes.

29:51.019 --> 29:53.439
What do you say
we make some new ones tonight?

29:53.439 --> 29:56.190
Oh! Yeah, sorry,
there is no smoking here.

29:56.775 --> 29:59.819
And we don't engage
in frivolities anymore.

29:59.819 --> 30:02.447
- We've, uh, matured.
- What, from six months ago?

30:02.447 --> 30:06.160
We're focused on the future. We get
high on making a global impact now.

30:06.160 --> 30:08.579
That's why we're here.
Luc's an intern at the ICC.

30:08.579 --> 30:11.123
He's presenting a paper
on the proliferation of opioids.

30:11.123 --> 30:14.375
Well, why not proliferate them
here instead?

30:14.375 --> 30:18.046
This isn't a joke, Max.
We're not interested.

30:21.383 --> 30:22.885
Here you go.

30:22.885 --> 30:25.178
Aren't you happy?
Your cachet falling

30:25.178 --> 30:27.680
isn't because you've gotten boring.
It's because everyone else has.

30:27.680 --> 30:30.308
No, they've just forgotten
what fun is.

30:30.308 --> 30:33.144
And it's up to us
to remind them.

30:36.314 --> 30:37.983
Now's our moment.
Don't forget to mention

30:37.983 --> 30:40.361
my passion for protecting
the environment.

30:40.361 --> 30:42.320
Tiffany,
let me introduce you to...

30:42.320 --> 30:44.531
Monet De Haan.
No introduction necessary.

30:44.531 --> 30:47.159
I've been following you
for years. Consider me a fan.

30:47.159 --> 30:48.576
The feeling is mutual.

30:48.576 --> 30:51.204
From tailing to trending
in record time. I'm impressed.

30:51.204 --> 30:54.290
I was just waiting in the wings
for Julien's inevitable crash.

30:54.791 --> 30:57.628
And now I'm waiting for you
to leave this conversation.

30:57.628 --> 30:59.338
- Okay. Bye.
- Thank you.

30:59.338 --> 31:02.090
The triad is dead in the water, and
De Haan is vaguely under control.

31:02.090 --> 31:05.259
Little Z may be a time bomb,
but I'm keeping watch.

31:05.259 --> 31:08.806
- Grace's twin brother is kinda cute.
- Do not even think about it.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.352
Zoya, what are you doing here?

31:14.352 --> 31:17.271
You said you're meeting with partners
from an international law firm, right?

31:17.271 --> 31:19.483
- So where are they?
- They're...

31:19.483 --> 31:23.612
Hey, fam! You know, have you seen
the view from the roof?

31:23.612 --> 31:26.406
- It is lovely this time of year.
- February?

31:26.406 --> 31:29.450
Don't you wanna introduce me
to your potential new bosses?

31:29.784 --> 31:31.704
I haven't seen them yet.
It's a big space.

31:32.204 --> 31:36.959
Big. Yeah. And yet, small world,
there's Greyson De Haan.

31:36.959 --> 31:38.376
What's he doing here?

31:38.376 --> 31:41.546
You would know because he's the one
you're here to see, aren't you?

31:41.546 --> 31:43.548
I'm not here to meet Greyson.

31:43.548 --> 31:46.759
I'm going to give you one more chance
to tell me the truth.

31:46.759 --> 31:49.722
Zoya, can I talk to you
for a second?

31:52.099 --> 31:54.559
Can we save
the family showdown for home?

31:54.559 --> 31:58.396
I'm sure whatever you think your dad
is doing is worthy of this reaction.

31:58.396 --> 32:00.023
But Obie really needs tonight
to go well.

32:00.023 --> 32:04.028
And this doesn't need
to happen here. Please?

32:06.029 --> 32:07.406
All right.

32:10.908 --> 32:14.120
- You have them follow a dress code?
- And other edicts.

32:14.747 --> 32:17.541
I'll have to try that.
I do already have my teachers

32:17.541 --> 32:19.834
taking my exams
and writing my papers.

32:19.834 --> 32:23.839
Not to mention pretending to bestie-up
to Goody Grace Byron, right?

32:23.839 --> 32:28.052
- A woman after my own dark heart.
- Talking about the same Grace?

32:29.969 --> 32:32.473
Spotted, the ascending Queen
of Constance

32:32.473 --> 32:35.851
forming an alliance
with the Empress of Exeter.

32:35.851 --> 32:38.729
Is this just a simple meeting
of the minds,

32:38.729 --> 32:41.607
or an international affair
in the making?

32:41.607 --> 32:45.151
- Gossip Girl doesn't waste time.
- It's crazy, right?

32:45.151 --> 32:46.944
Although maybe not.

32:47.363 --> 32:49.615
Are you proposing
what I think you're proposing?

32:50.031 --> 32:53.369
You and me, as the power couple
of the ruling class.

32:53.369 --> 32:56.997
Exponentially raising
our followers overnight.

32:56.997 --> 32:59.375
Consolidating powers
across school lines.

32:59.375 --> 33:03.712
Setting trends and striking fear
throughout the Eastern Seaboard.

33:03.712 --> 33:06.090
- We would be...
- Unstoppable.

33:06.464 --> 33:09.802
So, how should we seal
this alliance?

33:18.352 --> 33:20.938
Okay. We've got plenty
to send to Gossip Girl.

33:21.272 --> 33:23.398
- Or not.
- We're good here.

33:25.442 --> 33:29.071
Don't get me wrong. You're smart,
stunning, cunning, and cruel,

33:29.071 --> 33:31.073
but I'm not really into girls.

33:31.073 --> 33:33.200
Excuse me? Everyone knows

33:33.200 --> 33:36.244
that you're the supreme sapphic
of the sleepover schools.

33:36.244 --> 33:39.748
Everyone thinks I am. But...
I actually have a boyfriend.

33:40.457 --> 33:42.917
Don't tell anyone, though,
'cause this is really working for me.

33:42.917 --> 33:45.086
You're queerbaiting?
For cred?

33:45.837 --> 33:48.007
Nobody cared about me
when I was straight.

33:48.007 --> 33:51.342
I "became" a lesbian
and now I'm front of mind.

33:51.342 --> 33:53.595
People are digging around
a bit, though,

33:53.595 --> 33:55.597
which is why I'm glad
to have met you.

33:55.597 --> 33:59.560
Now we can both get what we want.
Power and influence.

34:01.312 --> 34:02.688
What's the problem?

34:02.688 --> 34:06.649
You of all people understand it's the
illusion that matters, not reality.

34:07.818 --> 34:10.320
If you want, I can eat you out
every now and then,

34:10.320 --> 34:12.989
as long as you let
my boyfriend watch.

34:20.664 --> 34:23.124
- What was it this time?
- Drunk and disorderly.

34:23.124 --> 34:26.128
We brought him in about an hour ago,
but to release him, we're gonna need...

34:26.128 --> 34:30.049
Copy of his driver's license,
proof of residency, and 400 cash.

34:30.049 --> 34:33.843
- Already handed over at the desk.
- And 28-dollar processing fee.

34:33.843 --> 34:36.929
- Twelve more than Jersey.
- You can wait in here.

34:37.890 --> 34:41.560
Now that you know I'm not a liar,
please feel free to leave.

34:41.560 --> 34:44.020
It usually takes
a couple hours from here.

34:44.020 --> 34:46.564
If it's okay with you,
I'll stay.

34:56.783 --> 35:02.289
Power is being talked about.
If I wanna get back on the map,

35:02.289 --> 35:04.332
I need to get Luc and them
back on it first.

35:04.332 --> 35:06.709
- Seems like a tall order.
- No. No, no, no.

35:06.709 --> 35:08.837
Their inner wolves
are just dormant.

35:08.837 --> 35:11.715
It's my goal to have them
lurching out to their Lambos

35:11.715 --> 35:13.008
like Leo
by the end of the night.

35:13.008 --> 35:14.258
But how?

35:14.258 --> 35:19.515
To regain my seat at the table,
we're gonna have to make a scene.

35:19.515 --> 35:21.141
You ready?

35:22.809 --> 35:26.355
He's never gonna tell me the truth,
no matter how many times I ask him.

35:26.355 --> 35:30.025
So now your food, mortgage, and tuition
all come from Big Pharma?

35:30.025 --> 35:32.861
- At least you have a good hookup.
- It's not funny!

35:32.861 --> 35:34.363
This is blood money.

35:34.363 --> 35:36.322
If you really want him
to admit the truth,

35:36.322 --> 35:39.702
there is one way to do it.
But you're not gonna like it.

35:52.423 --> 35:54.716
You sending that in to GG?

35:55.675 --> 35:59.763
- It's what you want, right?
- And yet, I'm hesitating.

35:59.763 --> 36:01.055
Why?

36:01.055 --> 36:05.894
I wanted a sapphic victory,
but I got a Pyrrhic one instead.

36:06.728 --> 36:08.855
Turns out,
she's a secret straight.

36:08.855 --> 36:12.568
So we're like the Gen Z KStew
and RPattz.

36:12.568 --> 36:16.322
What's the big deal with that?
You're using her, she's using you.

36:16.322 --> 36:17.906
Oh, like you were using Grace.

36:17.906 --> 36:21.284
You were using her, to get to Tiff.
I just wanna be her friend.

36:21.284 --> 36:23.746
The only reason that you want
to get in good with Grace

36:23.746 --> 36:26.624
is to get back
into Obie's good graces.

36:27.333 --> 36:30.543
It's okay. It's human nature
for us to convince ourselves

36:30.543 --> 36:35.465
that the things we're doing
are noble when they're selfish.

36:36.050 --> 36:40.220
But when it comes
to compromising my identity...

36:41.137 --> 36:42.764
I have to draw the line.

36:47.686 --> 36:51.105
I can't believe I'm saying this...
but I'm proud of you.

36:51.105 --> 36:52.607
Don't be too proud.

36:52.607 --> 36:55.652
I'm going to give Tiff Meyers
the coming out she truly deserves.

36:55.652 --> 36:58.821
- Do you have to do that now?
- Why shouldn't I?

36:58.821 --> 37:00.406
Obie asked f...

37:03.661 --> 37:06.914
You know what?
Go for it.

37:17.341 --> 37:19.843
I had 'em in the crosshairs.

37:20.176 --> 37:24.056
I looked good, I said all the right
things, bought 'em drinks,

37:24.056 --> 37:26.809
and they still
turned me down flat.

37:26.809 --> 37:31.522
I just want
my seat at the fucking table!

37:31.522 --> 37:34.357
I upholstered
the goddamn seat!

37:36.401 --> 37:37.944
What happened with Theresa?

37:37.944 --> 37:41.699
By the time she showed up,
she took one look at me and she...

37:43.284 --> 37:47.621
I guess I broke
my promise to her.

37:49.039 --> 37:52.458
She's gone. Theresa's gone.

37:52.458 --> 37:56.629
Why don't you get some rest,
and we'll talk about this tomorrow?

37:57.296 --> 37:59.591
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:00.467 --> 38:02.803
She ever tell you
about how she used to bust

38:02.803 --> 38:06.597
all the umbrellas in the house
pretending to be Mary Poppins?

38:07.598 --> 38:10.477
She was always trying
to make everything perfect.

38:11.103 --> 38:14.189
Always trying to fix everything.

38:15.356 --> 38:18.484
But everything kept on breaking.

38:20.778 --> 38:22.739
She tell you about that?

38:25.825 --> 38:28.494
No. She never told me that.

38:45.346 --> 38:47.221
Apologies. They're rolling.

38:47.221 --> 38:51.517
I hope this doesn't offend your newfound
globally responsible sensibilities.

38:51.517 --> 38:54.396
- This is not the place for that, Max.
- DÃ©ja vu.

38:54.396 --> 38:57.816
Didn't you say that exact thing as you
bent me over the Vespa on Hydra?

38:57.816 --> 39:00.735
And, as I recall,
you were wrong then too.

39:00.735 --> 39:02.904
I nearly forgot about Hydra.

39:02.904 --> 39:05.240
Well, after taking
our entire supply of K,

39:05.240 --> 39:09.702
I'm not surprised. Allow me
to refresh your memories.

39:20.255 --> 39:22.757
The event is almost over.

39:22.757 --> 39:26.427
And we did it.
Thank you, again.

39:27.887 --> 39:33.852
I don't deserve that.
I owe you and Grace an apology.

39:34.395 --> 39:38.231
I only spent time with her today
so that I could get closer to you.

39:38.231 --> 39:40.525
I wanted us to be friends,
like before.

39:41.025 --> 39:43.779
And I shouldn't have used
Grace to do that,

39:43.779 --> 39:45.697
and yet, that's my nature.

39:45.697 --> 39:49.535
If I can't get what I want,
instead of letting it go,

39:49.535 --> 39:52.204
I just figure out another way
of going after it.

39:52.204 --> 39:57.667
Really been beating myself up
about that. But the truth is...

39:57.667 --> 40:02.422
I am sick of pretending
that I'm some great person.

40:02.422 --> 40:05.550
I use people.
I try to control things.

40:05.550 --> 40:07.635
You should let everyone be
who they are too.

40:07.635 --> 40:10.263
I'm trying to make a good impression
on my girlfriend's family.

40:10.263 --> 40:13.600
But what about the next time?
And the time after that?

40:13.600 --> 40:15.935
Life around us is never smooth.

40:15.935 --> 40:18.563
And you're only gonna be able
to hide that for so long

40:18.563 --> 40:21.149
before it explodes all over you.

40:26.904 --> 40:29.949
I can't ever unsee that.

40:29.949 --> 40:31.327
I don't even know what that is.

40:31.910 --> 40:35.331
Those were exhilarating times.

40:35.663 --> 40:39.917
- A shame they're behind us now.
- Ah, but see, they don't have to be.

40:39.917 --> 40:42.503
I mean, what good is it
in saving Mother Earth

40:42.503 --> 40:45.715
if you cannot revel
in her earthly delights?

40:48.801 --> 40:50.596
Don't mind if I do.

40:52.847 --> 40:56.185
What the hell?
For old times' sake?

41:03.941 --> 41:05.985
See you on the other side.

41:08.155 --> 41:10.531
I wish I could say
he's not usually like this.

41:10.531 --> 41:14.411
- Nah, you don't need to explain.
- I just... He's my dad. You know?

41:14.411 --> 41:17.413
He's given me everything. He went
broke putting me through Barnard,

41:17.413 --> 41:20.541
bankrupt sending me to Iowa.
I owe him everything.

41:20.541 --> 41:23.753
I'm the safest bet he ever made,
and I came up short.

41:23.753 --> 41:27.049
- Nah, you're too hard on yourself.
- Not hard enough.

41:27.049 --> 41:29.300
I'm a failed writer
turned failing teacher.

41:29.300 --> 41:32.137
I took those frustrations out
on the head teacher

41:32.137 --> 41:34.223
instead of dealing
with them myself.

41:34.223 --> 41:37.393
Then I felt so gross about it
that I convinced Jordan

41:37.393 --> 41:41.522
and Wendy to convince you
that I'm not as bad a person

41:41.522 --> 41:43.481
as I actually am?

41:47.026 --> 41:48.821
I should probably get going.

41:50.822 --> 41:53.783
Of course.

41:56.120 --> 42:01.417
You know... none of us are as bad
as we think we are.

42:03.334 --> 42:06.255
No...
Some of us are worse.

42:31.446 --> 42:34.700
- I'm sorry, my daughter is where?
- She's just around this corner.

42:34.700 --> 42:36.493
Yeah, she just asked me
to get you. And look...

42:36.493 --> 42:40.330
- Nick.
- Greyson. Oh, God.

42:41.498 --> 42:43.458
Z, please.
Now's not the best time.

42:43.458 --> 42:45.418
For the truth to come out?
Why not?

42:45.418 --> 42:48.839
What is going on,
and where's Monet?

42:48.839 --> 42:50.341
Z, please.

42:51.716 --> 42:54.344
As his new boss, Mr. De Haan,
you should know

42:54.344 --> 42:57.306
that my father's a liar.
He lied about his promotion,

42:57.306 --> 42:59.057
he lied about why he was
coming here tonight,

42:59.057 --> 43:02.143
and he even lied
about working with you.

43:02.143 --> 43:04.647
You decided to go
with De Haan Pharma?

43:04.647 --> 43:06.106
No. I'm just...

43:06.106 --> 43:09.693
Using me to leverage an offer
from Debevoise and Plimpton, right?

43:10.485 --> 43:14.697
That's not how we do business, Nick.
Consider my offer rescinded.

43:16.741 --> 43:18.326
Wait, I thought...

43:18.326 --> 43:21.288
No. I know what you thought,
but you were wrong.

43:21.664 --> 43:25.708
And your stunt now cost me
not just one, but two jobs.

43:26.125 --> 43:27.835
I didn't mean
to lead you on, sir.

43:27.835 --> 43:31.881
Nick, you leveraging me
for something better...

43:32.716 --> 43:35.468
that's how I do business.

43:35.468 --> 43:39.056
My offer still stands.
And in fact, I'll double it.

43:42.685 --> 43:44.144
- I accept.
- Okay.

43:47.398 --> 43:48.774
I'm so sorry!

43:50.108 --> 43:51.275
Friend of yours?

43:51.275 --> 43:52.945
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

43:52.945 --> 43:55.656
What the hell is this?

43:55.656 --> 43:57.448
Obie! Come join us!

43:57.448 --> 43:59.450
Of course!
These are your friends too!

43:59.450 --> 44:01.119
Mom, this isn't Obie's fault.

44:01.119 --> 44:04.456
Uh... yes, it is.
'Cause I tried to stop it.

44:07.959 --> 44:09.377
Gossipgirl posted a photo.

44:09.712 --> 44:12.715
This just in.
Looks like Exeter's shining star

44:12.715 --> 44:15.509
may not burn as bright
as she thinks.

44:15.968 --> 44:20.597
Or maybe that's just the light
reflecting from her pants on fire.

44:28.146 --> 44:30.149
You told Gossip Girl I'm het?

44:30.149 --> 44:33.694
Yes. Also that you're a bad kisser.
I think it might be too much tongue.

44:34.653 --> 44:36.112
Dyke.

44:36.487 --> 44:38.782
You're not gonna
treat my friend like that.

44:38.782 --> 44:41.035
Well, your friend's a bitch.

44:45.371 --> 44:48.250
When I said "war," I didn't know
I meant on the same side!

44:48.250 --> 44:49.709
- Don't you love it?
- Oh, I do, Julien.

44:49.709 --> 44:51.044
Hey. Come on.

44:51.044 --> 44:53.129
- All right. Hey, that's enough.
- Come on.

44:53.129 --> 44:56.216
- You'll be hearing from my lawyers!
- Okay, worth it, I promise!

44:56.216 --> 44:58.426
Obie, I'm sorry.
I am who I am!

45:00.846 --> 45:02.264
We're leaving.

45:15.151 --> 45:17.195
Do it. Do it!

45:37.465 --> 45:39.634
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey!

45:39.634 --> 45:41.345
She's up. Finally.

45:41.345 --> 45:44.806
- How are you feeling?
- I'm feelin' great.

45:44.806 --> 45:47.184
Gotta be at Penn Station
in a couple hours.

45:47.184 --> 45:49.519
There's an estate sale
I wanna hit.

45:49.519 --> 45:51.562
Heard it through the grapevine
the owners have a collection

45:51.562 --> 45:53.983
of antique velvet,
pennies on the dollar.

45:58.612 --> 46:02.115
I know what you're gonna say.
But you don't need to worry.

46:02.449 --> 46:07.203
- This time, I remembered the bananas.
- Thanks, Dad.

46:12.083 --> 46:15.128
NEW MESSAGE
HI HEAD TEACHER DUVALL...

46:26.265 --> 46:30.101
To everyone watching,
we are here to kill the "besting" trend.

46:30.685 --> 46:33.188
And ask why it was ever a trend
in the first place.

46:33.564 --> 46:36.150
Why do we love pitting women
against each other?

46:36.150 --> 46:39.485
Why compete for space when there
is enough room for us all?

46:39.485 --> 46:42.948
- I know I've been guilty of that.
- We all have.

46:42.948 --> 46:47.620
It's a story that's been told long
before hashtags, duets, or feeds.

46:47.620 --> 46:49.537
And who does it really serve?

46:49.537 --> 46:54.083
It's time we finally stop that story
and start a real conversation.

46:54.083 --> 46:57.129
Won't you join us?
We go live in five.

46:58.254 --> 47:00.841
I feel like
I'm in a Black Mirror episode.

47:00.841 --> 47:03.593
He's this, like, completely different
person I don't even recognize.

47:03.593 --> 47:06.095
I'm telling you,
we gotta do an exorcism.

47:06.095 --> 47:08.515
I know a hot priest. You know
what would look fab with that?

47:08.515 --> 47:10.975
Those Doc Martensnfrom
the church lost and found.

47:10.975 --> 47:14.772
- I think they're in the front closet.
- Go get 'em, girl. I'll wait.

47:16.899 --> 47:20.027
Take it we're still not speaking?
Hold on.

47:21.402 --> 47:23.697
I'll transfer my signing bonus
to you directly.

47:24.030 --> 47:25.658
And if my new salary holds,

47:25.658 --> 47:29.160
I'll be able to buy the place back from
you fully in the next couple of years.

47:29.160 --> 47:31.788
Thank you, Davis.
I appreciate it.

47:32.789 --> 47:33.915
What the fuck?

47:36.085 --> 47:37.418
Thank you.

47:37.418 --> 47:39.838
Good morning, Senator Byron.

47:40.464 --> 47:44.051
- Would you like to get a coffee...
- Not necessary. I'll make this short.

47:44.051 --> 47:46.219
Last night was unacceptable.

47:47.387 --> 47:49.972
- I'm truly sorry. I...
-"Sorry" won't cut it.

47:49.972 --> 47:52.475
You've proven you're a liability
to my campaign.

47:52.475 --> 47:56.438
But... my daughter's happiness
is more important to me.

47:56.438 --> 47:58.983
I can assure you I won't be inviting
my friends to any more events.

47:58.983 --> 48:01.567
That goes without saying.
But one friend in particular

48:01.567 --> 48:04.112
I'd prefer you extricate
from your life.

48:06.490 --> 48:08.367
The driver just gave me
his demo?

48:08.367 --> 48:10.743
If his music is anything
like his ride, it stinks.

48:10.743 --> 48:14.873
No, no. That is the sweet stench
of victory, my dear.

48:14.873 --> 48:18.002
After I paid for my messy mates'
rides home last night,

48:18.002 --> 48:20.421
Jed was the only car
that would pick me up.

48:20.421 --> 48:24.799
Four-point-one-two!
Max Wolfe's back, baby.

48:24.799 --> 48:27.261
So, what's next?
A power table at Odeon?

48:27.635 --> 48:29.178
Cut the line at Ostbahnhof?

48:29.178 --> 48:32.807
No. I think I'd rather just spend
the night with you two. At home.

48:32.807 --> 48:34.934
I mean,
what good is a bad reputation

48:34.934 --> 48:37.854
if you can't spend it
with the ones you care about?

48:43.319 --> 48:47.156
If she found out what you did,
it wasn't from me, Keller.

48:47.156 --> 48:50.159
I know. It was from me.

48:51.285 --> 48:53.536
I don't want to be like my dad,

48:53.536 --> 48:56.999
always saying I'll change tomorrow
and then never doing it.

48:56.999 --> 49:01.086
I am who I am, so it was time
I owned up to that.

49:02.296 --> 49:05.506
I told her myself.
And she understood.

49:05.506 --> 49:07.426
She said she would've done
the same thing.

49:07.426 --> 49:09.928
Takes a lot
to own up to that kind of thing.

49:10.638 --> 49:13.514
So let me own up
to something myself.

49:14.058 --> 49:18.686
The reason I came over last night
was to tell you not to worry about me.

49:19.396 --> 49:23.651
I was kinda offended you thought
I'd actually do something like that.

49:23.651 --> 49:25.860
I jump to conclusions
all the time

49:25.860 --> 49:29.072
about everyone and everything.
It is such a character flaw.

49:29.072 --> 49:32.451
- I don't know you very well, and...
- But I'd like you to.

49:32.451 --> 49:34.411
Ninth Precinct,
tomorrow morning?

49:34.827 --> 49:37.955
- Or maybe dinner tonight first?
- I'd like that.

49:37.955 --> 49:42.336
When the dust settles and conflict
has become compromise,

49:42.336 --> 49:45.923
we begin to see things
a little more clearly.

49:45.923 --> 49:47.840
We need to talk
about that TikTok.

49:48.299 --> 49:50.761
Monet and I are putting
the conflict behind us. Look.

49:50.761 --> 49:54.681
She even let me wear this. Small
step. Tomorrow I'm wearing heels.

49:54.681 --> 49:58.435
No. I meant your whole "Stop
the Story" concept is blowing up.

49:58.435 --> 50:00.187
-"Stop the Story"?
- Your words.

50:00.187 --> 50:02.064
It is catchy and catching on.

50:02.064 --> 50:05.608
And with the right help,
a.k.a. mine, it'll relaunch you.

50:05.608 --> 50:09.905
People want to know your struggles,
Your pain. They're gagging for it.

50:10.321 --> 50:13.324
What do you say?
Ready to take your influence back?

50:13.324 --> 50:18.289
And in that clarity, we find hope,
the chance at a brighter future.

50:18.706 --> 50:21.000
Hey. I came back with the Docs
and you were gone.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.376
So?
What do you think?

50:23.793 --> 50:28.006
Even when the voices in our head
tell us to keep ourselves guarded.

50:28.548 --> 50:32.093
- Is something wrong?
- No. Those boots slay.

50:33.803 --> 50:35.055
Come on. Let's go.

50:35.597 --> 50:37.890
To Grace: miss you already

50:42.603 --> 50:47.526
Because hope is fragile.
And trust is elusive.

50:53.072 --> 50:56.701
I was worried I wasn't gonna
see you before I left.

50:57.160 --> 50:59.245
I'd never let that happen.

51:12.675 --> 51:15.054
TO: +49 211 56150409
I'm getting closer.

51:15.054 --> 51:18.265
I should know who Gossip Girl is
by the end of the week.

51:18.265 --> 51:23.562
Nobody is ever truly safe.
Not even me.

51:25.022 --> 51:28.524
XOXO, Gossip Girl.

51:29.735 --> 51:34.448
