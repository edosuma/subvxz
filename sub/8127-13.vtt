     Here you are, Archie.      

00:56.657 --> 00:59.057
              What is this      
              I'm drinking here?

00:59.059 --> 01:02.027
Oh, that's a new brand          
of coffee I bought.             

01:02.029 --> 01:05.363
It's 97 percent                 
caffeine free.                  

01:05.364 --> 01:07.098
         Caffeine free?         

01:07.100 --> 01:10.568
If it ain't got caffeine in it, 
        it ain't coffee.        

01:10.570 --> 01:12.103
      How much did you pay      
         for this slop?         

01:13.105 --> 01:15.907
             $1.49.             

01:15.909 --> 01:20.145
You paid $1.49 for no caffeine? 

01:20.147 --> 01:24.615
    I can pay the same $1.49    
    and get caffeine.           

01:24.617 --> 01:27.251
But caffeine ain't good for you.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.653
    It don't let you sleep.     

01:28.655 --> 01:31.255
It's 10:00 in the morning.      

01:34.126 --> 01:36.360
     I don't want to sleep.     

01:36.362 --> 01:38.296
  That's why I drink caffeine.  

01:38.298 --> 01:40.131
    I want to stay up.          

01:40.133 --> 01:44.936
      But Archie, I saved       
 a lot of money on this coffee. 

01:44.938 --> 01:47.238
 A dollar off with the coupon.  

01:47.240 --> 01:48.606
          That's good.          

01:48.608 --> 01:52.443
  Then you won't lose so much   
     when you throw it out.     

01:52.445 --> 01:54.478
                Is there any    
                more coffee, Ma?

01:54.480 --> 01:57.348
Oh, lots. Your father           
don't like it.                  

01:57.350 --> 01:58.983
          No? I think it's good.

01:58.985 --> 02:00.351
     Do me a favor, Edith.      

02:00.353 --> 02:02.687
        No more of these        
     crummy bargains, huh?      

02:02.689 --> 02:06.424
But what'll I do with           
all these coupons I got?        

02:06.426 --> 02:07.592
See?                            

02:07.594 --> 02:09.160
"It's fall again,               

02:09.162 --> 02:11.229
"and inside                     
is your windfall                

02:11.231 --> 02:13.164
from Clara Goodbuys."           

02:13.166 --> 02:19.003
  I wonder if she got her job   
      because of her name.      

02:19.005 --> 02:24.075
     Not the "Clara" part,      
     the "Goodbuys" part...     

02:24.077 --> 02:26.711
Like in "good buys."            

02:26.713 --> 02:28.613
                      Who cares?

02:28.615 --> 02:29.680
         Good morning.          

02:29.682 --> 02:31.883
Oh, morning, Mike.              

02:31.885 --> 02:33.618
It's funny the way              

02:33.620 --> 02:37.756
some people's name just suits   
the business they're in.        

02:37.758 --> 02:43.161
        Like God's name         
    is just perfect for God.    

02:45.297 --> 02:46.564
              Well, you see, Ma,

02:46.566 --> 02:47.799
            that's because      
            you're brought up   

02:47.801 --> 02:48.933
              hearing that name.

02:48.935 --> 02:50.301
                You're used     
                to that word.   

02:50.303 --> 02:52.237
    Ah, you don't know          
what you're talking about.      

02:52.239 --> 02:53.437
                     Oh, really?

02:53.439 --> 02:55.373
    If you were taught          
      that God's name was,      

02:55.375 --> 02:57.242
    uh, let's say, "Chair,"     

02:57.244 --> 02:58.576
you'd be calling him "Chair."   

02:58.578 --> 03:00.111
                Get out of here.

03:00.113 --> 03:01.646
            You can't get people
            into a church       

03:01.648 --> 03:05.150
             to worship a chair.

03:05.152 --> 03:07.285
             People go to church
             to worship God.    

03:07.287 --> 03:09.154
 That's why they call him "God."

03:09.156 --> 03:11.555
    It depends on what word     
  you're brought up on, Daddy.  

03:11.557 --> 03:13.124
  See, uh, the Chinese people   

03:13.126 --> 03:15.160
     think the perfect name     
      for God is "Buddha."      

03:15.162 --> 03:17.028
You know, she's getting to sound

03:17.030 --> 03:19.497
     more and more like you     
      every day, Meathead.      

03:19.499 --> 03:21.666
Thanks for the compliment,      
             Daddy.             

03:21.668 --> 03:24.735
             [MOCKING VOICE]    
             "Thanks for the    
             compliment, Daddy."

03:24.737 --> 03:26.304
        Let me ask you          
        something, professor,   

03:26.306 --> 03:29.941
            which I'm putting   
            through school.     

03:29.943 --> 03:32.143
  Can you think of a better name
  for God than "God"?           

03:32.145 --> 03:33.845
  And don't give me no "Buddha."

03:33.847 --> 03:36.181
Well, how about "Jehovah"       
from the Old Testament?         

03:36.183 --> 03:37.381
                        No good.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.482
Why not?                        

03:38.484 --> 03:41.252
            Because he wasn't   
            no real god.        

03:41.254 --> 03:43.521
         Them old Bible Hebes   
         just called him Jehovah

03:43.523 --> 03:46.691
          because that was their
          word for the boss.    

03:50.696 --> 03:52.230
 Well, what are you looking at? 

03:52.232 --> 03:54.032
     You know, it's amazing     

03:54.034 --> 03:58.236
          how someone           
 can be so consistently wrong.  

03:58.238 --> 04:00.071
        I don't believe         
      the things you say.       

04:00.073 --> 04:01.372
Because you're an atheist.      

04:01.374 --> 04:02.941
You don't believe nothing       
        about religion.         

04:02.943 --> 04:06.444
I wonder what they say          
when they sneeze.               

04:14.686 --> 04:16.019
              Who's that, Edith?

04:16.022 --> 04:18.122
          The Chinese.          

04:18.124 --> 04:19.457
      I mean, do they say,      

04:19.459 --> 04:21.926
        "God bless you"         
     or "Buddha bless you"?     

04:25.297 --> 04:26.664
  If you really want to know,   

04:26.666 --> 04:28.699
     the Chinks just sneeze     
        and say nothing.        

04:28.701 --> 04:30.268
They can't speak English.       

04:33.939 --> 04:35.874
              Oh.               

04:37.809 --> 04:40.044
Why couldn't they say,          
"Buddha bless you" in Chinese?  

04:40.046 --> 04:44.282
    Because they don't say that,
    that's why.                 

04:44.284 --> 04:46.251
                 They say, uh...

04:46.253 --> 04:48.386
      Well, if they say anything
      at all, it's "Sayonara."  

04:50.789 --> 04:51.856
That's Japanese.                

04:51.858 --> 04:52.891
                     Same thing.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.626
It's not the same thing.        

04:55.628 --> 04:57.028
  What are you talking about?   

04:57.030 --> 04:58.629
         You put a Jap          
     and a Chink together,      

04:58.631 --> 05:00.498
    you're going to tell me     
        which is which?         

05:00.500 --> 05:03.268
         That's right,          
because I'd find out about them.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.903
I'd talk to them as individuals.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.237
Sure, you'd talk to them.       

05:06.239 --> 05:09.240
     You'd say, "Which one      
of you guys is the Chink?"      

05:09.242 --> 05:11.442
 I don't believe it!            
 He's making me crazy!          

05:11.444 --> 05:13.077
Ignore it, Michael,             
ignore him.                     

05:13.079 --> 05:14.578
Shouldn't we be                 
getting ready, anyway?          

05:14.580 --> 05:16.114
I mean, we're going             
to the museum.                  

05:16.116 --> 05:17.815
                 Oh, ho, ho.    
                 Listen to this.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.350
            Now, will you tell  
            me something, Edith?

05:19.352 --> 05:23.487
  Why would any normal person   
    want to go to the museum    

05:23.489 --> 05:24.789
        on his day off?         

05:24.791 --> 05:26.557
For this, Arch.                 

05:26.559 --> 05:28.826
Something you know              
absolutely nothing about.       

05:28.828 --> 05:29.827
Culture.                        

05:29.829 --> 05:31.529
    Oh, look at this.           

05:31.531 --> 05:33.564
 No wonder he's getting himself 
          all excited.          

05:33.566 --> 05:35.533
It's one of his own here.       

05:35.535 --> 05:37.568
     A Polack art exhibit.      

05:38.703 --> 05:42.040
    That's "Pollock."           

05:42.042 --> 05:43.841
        Jackson Pollock.        

05:47.212 --> 05:49.013
        He happens to be        
    a great American artist.    

05:49.015 --> 05:52.216
  Well, he sure paints Polish.  

05:52.218 --> 05:53.217
             Jeez.              

05:53.219 --> 05:54.585
                  Look at this--

05:54.587 --> 05:56.487
             splashes and smears
             of paint           

05:56.489 --> 05:58.189
        over everything here.   

05:58.191 --> 05:59.190
            What do you mean?   

05:59.192 --> 06:00.591
                  A monkey      
                  could do that.

06:00.593 --> 06:02.093
        A great American artist?

06:02.095 --> 06:04.095
        There ain't a tree      
        or a flag or a president

06:04.097 --> 06:05.663
         in the whole damn book.

06:05.665 --> 06:07.898
I'd explain it to you, Arch,    

06:07.900 --> 06:11.336
but first you'd have to move    
your brain ahead two centuries. 

06:14.406 --> 06:17.442
 Why don't you take a short walk
 on a long pier?                

06:17.444 --> 06:19.444
You can't even                  
get that right!                 

06:19.446 --> 06:21.245
      It's "Why don't you       
        take a long walk        

06:21.247 --> 06:22.480
    on a short pier?"           

06:27.319 --> 06:28.786
                Then do that.   

06:32.224 --> 06:33.224
                 Just forget it.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.558
                Come on, Gloria.
                let's go.       

06:34.560 --> 06:35.559
Okay.                           

06:35.561 --> 06:38.429
    Oh, Gloria! Mike!           

06:38.431 --> 06:40.498
Would you mind                  
mailing this letter             

06:40.500 --> 06:41.899
when you go downtown?           

06:41.901 --> 06:44.268
I've been meaning               
to mail it for a week.          

06:44.270 --> 06:45.403
                    Sure, Ma.   

06:45.405 --> 06:47.705
It's a funny thing              
about mailing a letter.         

06:47.707 --> 06:52.210
 When you remember to mail it,  
you ain't near a mailbox,       

06:52.212 --> 06:56.314
and when you're near a mailbox, 
      you don't remember.       

06:56.316 --> 06:58.349
                    Yeah.       

06:58.351 --> 07:00.751
        I never thought of that.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.453
         But then, why should I?

07:02.455 --> 07:05.390
     ARCHIE: Edith. Edith.      

07:05.392 --> 07:07.725
  Edith, I am in torture here   
    with these shoes.           

07:07.727 --> 07:08.726
          Where are youse going?

07:08.728 --> 07:10.294
We're going                     
to the museum.                  

07:10.296 --> 07:11.329
              Well, just wait   
              a minute.         

07:11.331 --> 07:12.930
          Youse got an errand   
          to do for me.         

07:12.932 --> 07:14.065
                        What?   

07:14.067 --> 07:16.334
    Ooh! Edith, these fancy     
    new no-lace shoes here,     

07:16.336 --> 07:17.801
      they're killing me.       

07:17.803 --> 07:19.670
        You were with me        
    when I buy these.           

07:19.672 --> 07:21.672
Why'd you let me buy 'em?       
Well, they looked fine.         

07:21.674 --> 07:22.873
     Well, they ain't fine.     

07:22.875 --> 07:24.642
      Well, they look fine      
    from the outside.           

07:24.644 --> 07:28.513
    The outside ain't where     
they're hurting me, Edith!      

07:28.515 --> 07:30.648
        Now, youse two,         
    just wait a second here.    

07:30.650 --> 07:32.750
      You're gonna to have      
      to take these shoes,      

07:32.752 --> 07:34.618
you're gonna have to            
get them stretched for me.      

07:34.620 --> 07:35.886
    All right.                  
    Let's have them.            

07:35.888 --> 07:37.755
          But, Archie,          
  what are you going to wear?   

07:37.757 --> 07:40.258
        Your other shoes        
     are being half-soled.      

07:40.260 --> 07:43.027
    Well, I'll have to wear     
my good shoes, that's all.      

07:43.029 --> 07:45.496
    Your Thom McAns?            

07:48.667 --> 07:51.835
What do you want me to do?      
     Walk around barefoot,      

07:51.837 --> 07:53.471
    like them weirdo friends    

07:53.473 --> 07:55.440
    that your daughter          
  used to have hanging around?  

07:55.442 --> 07:56.840
                  My friends are
                  not weirdos,  

07:56.842 --> 07:58.609
             and it doesn't make
             a person a weirdo  

07:58.611 --> 08:00.211
              just because      
              he walks barefoot.

08:00.213 --> 08:04.348
    Ah, God made feet           
      to be wearing shoes.      

08:04.350 --> 08:06.217
Going barefoot ain't civilized. 

08:06.219 --> 08:07.818
What are you saying?            
That wearing shoes              

08:07.820 --> 08:09.720
is the only thing that makes    
a person civilized?             

08:09.722 --> 08:13.291
      That's right, buddy,      
        shoes and pants.        

08:13.293 --> 08:15.093
All them old missionaries,      
     that's what they done      

08:15.095 --> 08:16.294
        the first thing         
    with the natives,           

08:16.296 --> 08:17.895
    put shoes on them           
    and pants on them           

08:17.897 --> 08:19.497
 and turn them into Christians. 

08:21.166 --> 08:23.534
I don't think Jesus wore shoes. 

08:23.536 --> 08:24.835
        Certainly.              

08:24.837 --> 08:27.605
  He wore shoes all the time,   
    except for that one time    

08:27.607 --> 08:29.140
        he went walking         
      on the water there.       

08:32.077 --> 08:33.977
        All right, now,         
on your way to the museum,      

08:33.980 --> 08:35.179
        take these shoes        
         to the store.          

08:35.181 --> 08:36.179
                  All right.    

08:36.182 --> 08:37.315
  Now, where you running away?  

08:37.317 --> 08:38.948
 You ain't got the sales slip,  
             right?             

08:38.951 --> 08:40.183
            Get them            
     the sales slip, Edith.     

08:40.186 --> 08:41.184
Oh, yeah.                       

08:41.187 --> 08:42.653
I put it in my purse            
somewhere.                      

08:42.655 --> 08:44.188
     You. You argue with me     
        about religion.         

08:44.190 --> 08:46.591
    You don't even know how     
 to take a pair of shoes back.  

08:46.593 --> 08:49.059
Yeah, I think                   
it's in here somewhere.         

08:49.061 --> 08:51.262
        Oh, here we go.         
The mystery grab bag here.      

08:51.264 --> 08:54.398
     Look at all this stuff     
      you got in the bag.       

08:54.400 --> 08:55.566
      What are you doing?       

08:55.568 --> 08:57.435
         A whole crowd          
      of paper clips here.      

08:57.437 --> 08:58.469
         Look at this.          

08:58.471 --> 09:00.571
  A gum wrapper, no gum in it.  

09:00.573 --> 09:01.872
        Come on, Edith.         

09:01.874 --> 09:03.474
        Why do you carry        
      this junk with you?       

09:03.476 --> 09:05.376
Here it is.                     
I found it.                     

09:05.378 --> 09:06.611
    Hey, Ma,                    

09:06.613 --> 09:08.279
          where'd you get       
          these lottery tickets?

09:08.281 --> 09:11.081
Oh, I forgot                    
all about them.                 

09:11.083 --> 09:12.450
Hold it, hold it, hold it.      

09:12.452 --> 09:14.952
 You got lottery tickets there? 
     Let me see them there.     

09:14.954 --> 09:17.688
    Edith, lottery tickets,     

09:17.690 --> 09:19.390
  four tickets, 50 cents each.  

09:19.392 --> 09:20.758
        That's 2 bucks.         

09:20.760 --> 09:24.928
     Hey, you did that all      
  without a pencil and paper.   

09:29.268 --> 09:31.101
    Button your face there.     

09:31.103 --> 09:32.370
     Daddy, there's no harm     

09:32.372 --> 09:34.172
        in a little bet         
      every now and then.       

09:34.174 --> 09:37.408
No, and you win                 
big money prizes.               

09:37.410 --> 09:39.743
Remember?                       
Mrs. Balini did.                

09:39.745 --> 09:41.646
            No. What the hell   
            did she ever win?   

09:41.648 --> 09:44.448
Oh, she won                     
two church raffles.             

09:44.450 --> 09:46.917
$10 and a chair cushion.        

09:46.919 --> 09:48.452
    Oh, yeah, that's right.     

09:48.454 --> 09:50.588
    The famous chair cushion    
    that nobody could sit on    

09:50.590 --> 09:52.089
         because it had         

09:52.091 --> 09:55.226
     an embroidered picture     
    of the Pope on it.          

09:55.228 --> 09:58.429
          Is that why?          

09:58.431 --> 10:01.865
    I always thought it was     
 because it was Anthony Quinn.  

10:03.669 --> 10:06.070
Use your common sense, will you?

10:06.072 --> 10:10.208
     It ain't "blastemious"     
to sit on Anthony Quinn's face. 

10:10.210 --> 10:14.445
     Still, it ain't nice.      

10:14.447 --> 10:15.813
Ma, did you know                

10:15.815 --> 10:17.548
that these tickets              
are 10 months old?              

10:17.550 --> 10:19.450
Yeah, I forgot                  
I had them.                     

10:19.452 --> 10:21.652
     Ma, did you ever check     
  to see if they won anything?  

10:21.654 --> 10:24.589
      No, I just put them       
        in my pocketbook        

10:24.591 --> 10:26.524
and forgot all about them.      

10:26.526 --> 10:28.959
 Oh, sure. Easy come, easy go.  

10:28.961 --> 10:31.262
     The $2 could have been     
 in the bank earning interest.  

10:31.264 --> 10:33.097
         Come on, Arch,         
    2 measly dollars.           

10:33.099 --> 10:34.565
Didn't you ever bet on anything?

10:34.567 --> 10:36.867
              Yes.              

10:36.869 --> 10:39.737
     I bet that my daughter     
would marry a human being,      

10:39.739 --> 10:42.106
          and I lost.           

10:42.108 --> 10:44.074
                Come on, Gloria,
                let's go.       

10:44.076 --> 10:45.209
EDITH:                          
Wait a minute.                  

10:45.211 --> 10:46.377
Would you mind                  

10:46.379 --> 10:48.346
dropping some clothes           
at the cleaners                 

10:48.348 --> 10:50.013
on your way                     
to the subway?                  

10:50.015 --> 10:51.181
                  No, Ma,       
                  we don't mind.

10:51.183 --> 10:52.783
I'll be right down.             

10:52.785 --> 10:53.951
I can't get over it.            

10:53.953 --> 10:56.053
Edith buying                    
lottery tickets.                

10:56.055 --> 10:57.421
    I bet you wouldn't          
         be complaining         

10:57.423 --> 10:58.589
         if Ma had won.         

10:58.591 --> 11:00.558
      Ah, nobody ever wins      
    on them lotteries.          

11:00.560 --> 11:03.093
Hey, it says here that          
these tickets are valid         

11:03.095 --> 11:05.329
up to one year                  
after the purchase.             

11:05.331 --> 11:06.830
      Ah, forget about it.      

11:06.832 --> 11:07.865
But how would you know          

11:07.867 --> 11:09.600
what the winning number was     
way back then?                  

11:09.602 --> 11:11.636
      You call the candy store. 
      They sell lottery tickets.

11:11.638 --> 11:12.770
    They probably have a list   

11:12.772 --> 11:14.372
          of the winning numbers
          for the past year.    

11:14.374 --> 11:16.574
    What's the first prize?     
            $50,000.            

11:16.576 --> 11:18.609
  Wow, think what you could do  
    with all of that!           

11:18.611 --> 11:21.646
        I'm telling you,        
you're wasting your time.       

11:21.648 --> 11:24.548
             Edith,             
where are the Thom McAns?       

11:24.550 --> 11:25.949
EDITH: What, Archie?            

11:25.951 --> 11:29.086
         I said, Edith,         
bring down my good shoes!       

11:29.088 --> 11:31.989
I'm sorry, Archie,              
I didn't hear you.              

11:31.991 --> 11:34.425
I was in the closet             
getting your good shoes.        

11:34.427 --> 11:35.426
What did you say?               

11:38.430 --> 11:39.630
                 Nothing, Edith.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.031
Here's the cleaning, Mike.      

11:41.033 --> 11:43.301
      Please, I can't hear      
     what the man's saying.     

11:43.303 --> 11:44.635
Who is she talking to?          

11:44.637 --> 11:46.136
            She's calling about 
            the lottery tickets.

11:46.138 --> 11:49.106
     She's wasting her time     
just like you wasted our money. 

11:49.108 --> 11:51.108
        EDITH: But, Archie...   

11:51.110 --> 11:52.777
Ma! Ma! You did it! You did it! 

11:52.779 --> 11:55.145
You did it, Ma!                 

11:55.147 --> 11:56.880
The last four                   
numbers match!                  

11:56.882 --> 11:57.881
                        What?   

11:57.883 --> 11:58.882
The last four                   
numbers?                        

11:58.884 --> 11:59.883
That's $500!                    

11:59.885 --> 12:01.018
                        What?   
            $500!               

12:01.020 --> 12:02.252
    Daddy, the last             
    four numbers match!         

12:02.254 --> 12:03.821
    This ticket's a winner!     

12:03.823 --> 12:05.022
                The last four   
                numbers here?   
         Yeah!                  

12:05.024 --> 12:06.424
                He told you     
                on the phone?   
    Yeah!                       

12:06.426 --> 12:07.425
                    A winner?   
             Yeah!              

12:07.427 --> 12:08.426
                        $500?   
        Yeah!                   

12:08.428 --> 12:09.293
                        $500!   

12:10.595 --> 12:12.996
Oh, yeah, sure,                 
you change your tune fast.      

12:12.998 --> 12:14.532
A second ago,                   
you were against it.            

12:14.534 --> 12:15.899
            Oh, ho, you don't   
            hear me             

12:15.901 --> 12:18.235
        being against no $500   
        there, Meathead.        

12:18.237 --> 12:20.538
      Daddy, a minute ago,      
    you were bawling Ma out.    

12:20.540 --> 12:22.239
      Well, a minute ago,       
        she was a loser.        

12:22.241 --> 12:23.708
      Now she's a winner.       

12:23.710 --> 12:24.908
      Don't argue with me.      

12:24.910 --> 12:26.510
              Let me figure how 
              I'm going to spend

12:26.512 --> 12:27.945
            these five bills.   

12:27.947 --> 12:29.347
    That's Ma's money.          
She bought these tickets.       

12:29.349 --> 12:30.681
  What are you talking about?   

12:30.683 --> 12:32.115
    She wouldn't have           
        found the ticket        

12:32.117 --> 12:33.617
        if it wasn't for        
        my tight shoes.         

12:33.619 --> 12:34.785
     Right, Edith? Right--      

12:34.787 --> 12:37.120
Edith, Edith, what are you doing
         on the phone?          

12:37.122 --> 12:38.522
I'm talking.                    

12:38.524 --> 12:40.924
 You want to let the world know 
 you got a winning ticket?      

12:40.926 --> 12:44.161
Just Louise Jefferson.          
        The worst person of all!

12:44.163 --> 12:45.763
        Them people will be     
        beating on the tom-toms!

12:45.765 --> 12:47.465
          The whole neighborhood
          will know!            

12:51.102 --> 12:52.636
            Put that phone down.

12:52.638 --> 12:54.538
I'll see you later, Louise.     
            Put that phone down.

12:54.540 --> 12:55.539
         Put that phone down.   

12:55.541 --> 12:56.741
            Put that phone down!

12:56.743 --> 12:58.342
          Now, come on,         
          get your hat and coat.

12:58.344 --> 13:00.143
          We've got to get down 
          to the lottery office.

13:00.145 --> 13:01.144
What for, Archie?               

13:01.146 --> 13:02.546
            We're going to      
            cash in this ticket.

13:02.548 --> 13:04.749
Oh, no, we got no right         
to claim that money, Archie.    

13:04.751 --> 13:06.584
We can't do that.               
                Why not?        

13:06.586 --> 13:09.086
          EDITH: We got no right
          to claim that money.  

13:09.088 --> 13:12.590
         Don't be bothering me  
         with details, will you?

13:12.592 --> 13:15.860
Archie, that ticket             
don't belong to us.

             What was that?     

13:29.675 --> 13:32.209
That ticket don't belong to us. 

13:32.211 --> 13:34.011
                 What was that? 

13:34.013 --> 13:35.012
[SHOUTING]                      
That tick--                     

13:35.014 --> 13:36.980
                  I hear you!   

13:44.756 --> 13:46.156
        Edith, wait a minute.   

13:46.158 --> 13:47.925
                    You paid for
                    the ticket, 

13:47.927 --> 13:49.727
                  so the ticket 
                  belongs to us.

13:49.729 --> 13:52.096
No, Archie,                     
that ticket ain't ours.         

13:52.098 --> 13:55.232
                 Will you try   
                 and make sense?

13:55.234 --> 13:57.467
             Ma, if it's not    
             yours, whose is it?

13:57.469 --> 13:59.469
     It's Mr. Jefferson's.      

13:59.471 --> 14:01.471
                I just told     
                Louise Jefferson

14:01.473 --> 14:02.506
                  the good news.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.741
            She was so happy.   

14:03.743 --> 14:05.676
                  She'll be here
                  any minute.   

14:05.678 --> 14:07.911
         Edith, Edith.          

14:07.913 --> 14:09.680
             If this is         
             Jefferson's ticket,

14:09.682 --> 14:11.715
        how come it turned up   
        in your purse?          

14:11.717 --> 14:15.418
Because Mr. Jefferson           
won't wear his rubbers          

14:15.420 --> 14:16.820
in the rain.                    

14:22.160 --> 14:24.461
He's just like you, Archie.     

14:24.463 --> 14:27.197
He won't take an umbrella,      
he won't wear his rubbers--     

14:27.199 --> 14:28.632
             I'm talking about  
             the tickets, Edith.

14:28.634 --> 14:29.833
Yeah, I'm getting to that.      

14:29.835 --> 14:32.736
Remember when we had            
the big rainstorm--             

14:32.738 --> 14:33.971
         I'm talking            
         about the tickets here.

14:33.973 --> 14:35.405
And everything got flooded      

14:35.407 --> 14:37.274
and we got all that water       
in our basement?                

14:37.276 --> 14:39.409
             I'm talking about  
             the tickets, Edith.

14:39.411 --> 14:40.678
                Daddy, don't you
                know by now     

14:40.680 --> 14:42.379
            you got to let      
            Ma tell her story   

14:42.381 --> 14:43.413
                 in her own way?

14:43.415 --> 14:45.115
I know, but I ain't got time.   

14:45.117 --> 14:48.385
             I got to go to work
             on Monday morning. 

14:48.387 --> 14:51.889
        Edith, Edith, collect   
        your thoughts, huh?     

14:51.891 --> 14:52.890
                 Get over there.

14:52.892 --> 14:53.991
            Sit in the chair.   

14:53.993 --> 14:55.726
             Youse two, get over
             there on the sofa. 

14:55.728 --> 14:58.028
         MIKE: Oh, boy,         
 we'll never get to the museum. 

14:58.030 --> 15:00.030
            Just clam up.       
            Don't say nothing   

15:00.032 --> 15:02.232
        till I get to the bottom
        of all of this.         

15:02.234 --> 15:03.701
              Now, Edith, Edith,

15:03.703 --> 15:05.035
    I don't want to hear nothing

15:05.037 --> 15:06.970
        about nothing that don't
        have nothing to do      

15:06.972 --> 15:08.872
          with this here ticket,

15:08.874 --> 15:10.841
     and I want to hear it fast.

15:10.843 --> 15:14.644
Well, Louise                    
asked me if I would,            

15:14.646 --> 15:17.114
and I said I would, and I did,  
and I forgot 'em.               

15:29.728 --> 15:31.461
                That's too fast.

15:34.833 --> 15:39.103
     Now, I'm going to give you 
     leave to fill it in, Edith,

15:39.105 --> 15:41.905
        but have mercy on me,   
        please, will you?       

15:41.907 --> 15:43.306
                          Go.   

15:43.308 --> 15:46.910
Well, Mr. Jefferson             
went out without his rubbers,   

15:46.912 --> 15:48.678
and he came home with the flu,  

15:48.680 --> 15:50.480
and Louise had to               
take care of him,               

15:50.482 --> 15:51.949
and she couldn't get out.       

15:51.951 --> 15:54.184
So I was going out              
to do some shopping,            

15:54.186 --> 15:56.386
and I asked her                 
if I could get her something,   

15:56.388 --> 15:57.821
and she said yes--              

15:57.823 --> 15:59.990
a dozen eggs,                   
a half a pound of margarine,    

15:59.992 --> 16:02.159
a two-pound can                 
of coffee...                    

16:07.132 --> 16:09.532
Mr. Jefferson                   
likes it that way.              

16:11.970 --> 16:15.005
Am-- Am-- Am I filling in       
too much for you?               

16:19.610 --> 16:21.678
Well, here comes                
the ticket part.                

16:24.382 --> 16:27.484
Just as I was going             
out the door,                   

16:27.486 --> 16:31.121
Louise asked me if I would      
buy four lottery tickets.       

16:31.123 --> 16:32.990
George always buys them.        

16:32.992 --> 16:35.592
And I said, yes, I could,       
so I did,                       

16:35.594 --> 16:38.461
and I put 'em in my purse       
and I forgot 'em.               

16:38.463 --> 16:40.164
Does that answer                
your question?                  

16:40.166 --> 16:41.231
                Right, Edith.   

16:41.233 --> 16:42.800
                  You done fine.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.702
              Don't say no more.

16:45.704 --> 16:48.505
            What I got to do now
            is figure a way     

16:48.507 --> 16:50.774
  to straighten this thing out  
  so we don't lose nothing, see.

16:50.776 --> 16:51.641
                That's...       

16:58.449 --> 17:00.083
      And the first thing       
      that's gotta happen       

17:00.085 --> 17:02.552
        is you two              
     get out to the museum.     

17:02.554 --> 17:03.753
What is this                    
going to be,                    

17:03.755 --> 17:05.622
another one                     
of your devious plots?          

17:05.624 --> 17:06.857
Don't argue                     
with me, Meathead.              

17:06.858 --> 17:08.826
Come on, Gloria,                
get him out of here.            

17:08.828 --> 17:09.893
                  No, Daddy,    
                  not right now.

17:09.895 --> 17:11.694
        I want to wait till     
        Mrs. Jefferson gets here

17:11.696 --> 17:13.496
            so I can see        
            the look on her face

17:13.498 --> 17:14.698
             when she gets      
             her winning ticket.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.300
         That could be          
two, three hours from now.      

17:16.301 --> 17:17.733
            Ma said they'd be   
            here any minute.    

17:17.736 --> 17:19.368
    No, the way them people     
         shuffle along,         

17:19.371 --> 17:21.305
     they'll never make it.     

17:21.307 --> 17:23.673
         Will you stop          
     with the stereotypes?      

17:23.675 --> 17:26.476
  Black people don't shuffle!   
 They walk like everyone else!  

17:26.478 --> 17:29.880
Well, then, will you kindly     
walk like everyone else         

17:29.882 --> 17:31.581
and walk the hell out that door?

17:31.583 --> 17:32.582
Fine, fine.                     

17:32.584 --> 17:33.851
Come on, Gloria,                
let's go.                       

17:33.853 --> 17:36.019
Get moving, and take them shoes 
      back to that store!       

17:36.021 --> 17:36.887
                        Okay!   

17:43.261 --> 17:44.561
And what                        
are you doing?

Oh, no, Archie, you mean,       
     give them the ticket.

shared the money 50-50.

22:44.263 --> 22:45.495
                 Uh, Bunker, uh,

22:45.497 --> 22:46.896
            me and Louise       
            was talking it over,

22:46.898 --> 22:48.131
        and we decided, well,   

22:48.133 --> 22:50.967
          maybe we should       
          split the money 50-50.

22:50.969 --> 22:52.402
Listen to this guy!             

22:52.404 --> 22:55.238
Wants to split                  
the money 50-50.                

22:55.240 --> 22:56.573
Are you kidding, Jefferson?     

22:56.575 --> 22:58.241
The answer to that is no.       

22:58.243 --> 23:00.510
I'll spell it for you:          
N-O, no.                        

23:00.512 --> 23:01.911
                Are you sure?   

23:01.913 --> 23:03.980
I certainly am.                 

23:07.685 --> 23:10.453
            I was hoping        
            you'd say that. Bye!

23:19.497 --> 23:21.731
                Can you figure  
                them people out?

23:21.733 --> 23:22.999
         You tell them something

23:23.001 --> 23:24.801
         that's supposed to make
         them as mad as hell,   

23:24.803 --> 23:26.603
            but they bust out   
            in a smile.         

23:26.605 --> 23:31.341
I wish you was able             
to do that, Archie.             

23:31.343 --> 23:33.577
                Edith, I can    
                smile anyti--   

23:36.581 --> 23:40.383
                 Why did you say
                 that to me?    

23:40.385 --> 23:44.854
Because I gave Louise           
the lottery ticket.             

23:48.459 --> 23:51.294
                What was that?  

23:51.296 --> 23:53.230
I gave Louise the lot--         

23:53.232 --> 23:55.765
                What was that?  

23:55.767 --> 23:56.999
[SHOUTING]                      
I gave...                       

23:57.001 --> 23:59.469
                 I heard you!   

24:06.711 --> 24:08.144
        Archie, Archie.         

24:08.146 --> 24:11.548
        Look at the present     
        Mrs. Jefferson gave us--

24:11.550 --> 24:14.451
            a $100              
            gift certificate.   

24:14.453 --> 24:15.719
  Hey, that's                   
  sensational!                  

24:15.721 --> 24:17.854
                    Ma, that was
                    really nice!

24:17.856 --> 24:19.055
         Wait a minute.         

24:19.057 --> 24:21.190
Don't tell me them people       
         is being fair.         

24:21.192 --> 24:23.926
Let's take a look at this here. 

24:23.928 --> 24:26.028
There it is, "gift certificate."

24:26.030 --> 24:27.530
     "This entitles bearer      

24:27.532 --> 24:30.634
         to $100 worth

24:33.904 --> 24:36.172
    "Jeanette's Dress           
     and 'Ling-erie' Shop."     

24:42.446 --> 24:44.013
      Jeez, that's a hell       
         of a windfall          

24:44.015 --> 24:45.448
      for me, huh, Edith?       

25:02.132 --> 25:05.769
