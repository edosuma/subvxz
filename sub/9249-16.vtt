00:00.643 --> 00:02.557
<i>Previously on</i> Mike & Molly...

00:02.558 --> 00:05.693
I remember when I was a little
girl working on my daddy's farm.

00:05.694 --> 00:07.028
Oh, please don't tell me
a story.

00:07.029 --> 00:08.195
Let me tell you a story.

00:08.197 --> 00:10.130
I was a meek little thing,

00:10.132 --> 00:13.201
scared of my own shadow
and the sheep I had to castrate.

00:13.202 --> 00:16.670
That's where you learned it?

00:16.672 --> 00:18.940
I had to pump my own water,
make my own clothes,

00:18.941 --> 00:21.441
and if the crop didn't get in,
well, we all went hungry.

00:21.443 --> 00:23.745
Just when I thought my life

00:23.746 --> 00:25.546
couldn't possibly get any worse,

00:25.547 --> 00:27.715
a city fella in a '56 Rambler

00:27.716 --> 00:31.119
pulled up to the house
and asked for directions.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.452
Was that Mike's dad?

00:32.454 --> 00:35.356
Hell no.
This was a real man.

00:35.357 --> 00:38.159
Wore a three-piece suit
with hard shoes

00:38.160 --> 00:42.497
and smelled like a pine forest
after a spring rain.

00:42.498 --> 00:44.365
That's very poetic, Peggy.

00:44.366 --> 00:45.800
What he did to me wasn't poetic.

00:45.801 --> 00:47.301
It was filthy.

00:47.302 --> 00:50.103
And I loved it.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:50.105 --> 00:52.006
Got to write it down. Go.

00:52.007 --> 00:53.940
MIKE:
<i>Look at you, writing again.</i>

00:53.942 --> 00:57.110
Yeah, a new story about
a young girl coming of age

00:57.112 --> 01:00.680
on a hardscrabble farm at the
base of the Mudlick Mountains.

01:00.682 --> 01:01.616
Mudlick? Th-That's weird.

01:01.617 --> 01:04.483
My mom grew up on a farm
in Mudlick.

01:06.955 --> 01:09.156
Aw, no!

01:12.594 --> 01:16.264
You know, we could write
about my playmates growing up.

01:16.265 --> 01:19.866
My best friend was a chicken.

01:19.868 --> 01:21.602
Named him George Hamilton

01:21.603 --> 01:23.805
on account
of he was just as handsome

01:23.806 --> 01:26.540
and just as brown.

01:26.542 --> 01:27.809
Sure.

01:27.810 --> 01:29.242
You know, a flightless bird

01:29.244 --> 01:31.645
is a wonderful pet for a child.

01:31.647 --> 01:33.648
That is unless your father
has a mean streak

01:33.649 --> 01:36.250
and a taste for cacciatore.

01:36.251 --> 01:38.118
What do you think of this dress?

01:38.120 --> 01:39.320
Oh, for God's sake.

01:39.321 --> 01:42.355
Can you not think about
that party for ten minutes?

01:42.357 --> 01:44.025
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you get invited

01:44.026 --> 01:46.694
to big literary parties
every day? 'Cause I don't.

01:46.695 --> 01:48.762
Ah, who knows?
I don't get much mail

01:48.764 --> 01:51.966
since I accused the postman
of stealing the perfume cards

01:51.967 --> 01:54.334
out of my magazines.

01:55.270 --> 01:57.305
Where are you going?

01:57.306 --> 02:00.107
To try on this dress. We've done
enough work for the day.

02:00.108 --> 02:01.408
We haven't done a thing!

02:01.410 --> 02:04.110
Well, speak for yourself.
I found a dress.

02:08.183 --> 02:10.383
(buzzing)

02:11.119 --> 02:13.120
Keep buzzing, you bastards.

02:13.121 --> 02:15.089
Your reign of terror
is about to end.

02:15.090 --> 02:17.325
Don't tip 'em off.
Just smile and wave.

02:17.326 --> 02:19.927
Hello, wasps!
Just looking for the mail!

02:19.928 --> 02:21.394
All right,

02:21.396 --> 02:23.563
we got one chance
to torch their nest.

02:23.565 --> 02:26.366
You got to make sure
you keep that match lit.

02:26.368 --> 02:27.668
Hey, I got my end.

02:27.669 --> 02:29.403
You just worry about aiming
that Aqua Net.

02:29.404 --> 02:32.572
Are you sure you don't want
to call somebody?

02:32.574 --> 02:35.409
Or at least wait
for a third stooge?

02:35.410 --> 02:36.911
Nonsense. We got it.

02:36.912 --> 02:39.379
Besides, Carl was busy.

02:40.482 --> 02:42.749
(buzzing) (grunting, shouting)

02:47.356 --> 02:49.223
That's it.
I can't take it anymore.

02:49.224 --> 02:51.425
Just give 'em the porch.

02:51.426 --> 02:52.927
No. It ends today.

02:52.928 --> 02:55.196
You sting my bald head,
I burn down your house.

02:55.197 --> 02:57.631
It's the Chicago way.

02:57.633 --> 03:00.268
Wait a minute. Is that your
dress for the big party?

03:00.269 --> 03:02.202
Yeah, it is.
It's a little...

03:02.204 --> 03:03.771
a little flashy
for cocktail casual,

03:03.772 --> 03:05.873
but I thought, hey,
you only come up once,

03:05.874 --> 03:08.675
so they're gonna see
this up-and-comer coming.

03:08.677 --> 03:10.176
What-what party?

03:10.178 --> 03:12.713
Oh, it's nothing.
It's just a stuffy get-together

03:12.714 --> 03:15.283
with a bunch
of long-winded intellectuals.

03:15.284 --> 03:17.752
Ugh.
Exactly.

03:17.753 --> 03:20.153
I knew you'd hate it, and that's
why you don't have to go.

03:20.155 --> 03:21.354
Oh, no, I'm coming.

03:21.356 --> 03:23.624
No, Mike, seriously, you are...

03:23.625 --> 03:26.293
you are off the hook.

03:26.295 --> 03:27.595
Sweetie, I've been
married too long

03:27.596 --> 03:29.163
to fall for that one, all right?

03:29.164 --> 03:30.965
That's the old
"I don't need a birthday gift,"

03:30.966 --> 03:32.300
"Be honest about my haircut,"

03:32.301 --> 03:34.936
"Just tell me if you watch porn.
I don't care." Nah.

03:34.937 --> 03:37.438
No, sir. I will be at that party

03:37.439 --> 03:41.474
so you can show me off
to all your highbrow friends.

03:41.476 --> 03:44.045
Yeah. The-the thing is you
really don't need to do it...

03:44.046 --> 03:47.080
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.
I am going, and that is that.

03:47.082 --> 03:48.382
You ready to do this?

03:48.383 --> 03:50.283
I was born ready.

03:51.119 --> 03:54.287
Joyce, get the door.

03:55.190 --> 03:57.324
Go! Go! Go!

03:57.326 --> 03:59.327
(buzzing)

03:59.328 --> 04:01.028
VINCE: Oop! My match went out!

04:01.029 --> 04:03.297
MIKE: Well, light another one!
My can's almost empty!

04:03.298 --> 04:04.799
VINCE: Too late! It was a setup!

04:04.800 --> 04:06.399
They knew we were coming!
Aah!

04:06.401 --> 04:07.768
God, they're all over me!

04:07.769 --> 04:09.536
Should we do something?

04:09.538 --> 04:11.204
You're right.
I'll get the camera.

04:43.307 --> 04:45.274
Hey.
How's your patient?

04:45.275 --> 04:47.343
Well, for a guy
who swallowed three hornets,

04:47.344 --> 04:50.546
he's doing pretty good.

04:50.547 --> 04:52.181
Vince is a mess, too.

04:52.182 --> 04:54.849
I mean, we still
made love, but...

04:54.851 --> 04:58.487
oh, he was in a lot of pain.

04:58.488 --> 05:01.056
Really? Do we need to know that?

05:01.058 --> 05:01.924
You asked.

05:01.925 --> 05:04.427
Nobody asked.

05:04.428 --> 05:07.629
Is Mike still gonna be able
to go to your party? No.

05:07.631 --> 05:10.298
He says he is, but I'm gonna
encourage him to stay home.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.866
So he can rest?

05:12.703 --> 05:15.003
Sure.

05:15.005 --> 05:16.706
You don't want him to go.

05:16.707 --> 05:18.106
W... I didn't say that.

05:18.108 --> 05:19.342
Well, what are you saying?

05:19.343 --> 05:21.844
I'm saying that there's gonna be

05:21.845 --> 05:25.014
a bunch of stuffy,
overeducated intellectuals there

05:25.015 --> 05:27.650
and he's not gonna have anything
in common with them.

05:27.651 --> 05:28.817
Because he's dumb?

05:28.819 --> 05:30.619
No.

05:30.621 --> 05:32.887
Because you're afraid
he'll say something dumb.

05:33.724 --> 05:36.791
No.

05:37.928 --> 05:38.960
What?

05:38.962 --> 05:39.862
Seems very familiar,

05:39.863 --> 05:41.597
you not wanting your "family"

05:41.598 --> 05:43.498
to go to your events.

05:43.500 --> 05:47.002
Why-why did you air-quote
"family"?

05:47.004 --> 05:50.673
I'm sorry.
Did I "embarrass" you?

05:50.674 --> 05:55.010
No. Because I don't know
what you're "doing."

05:55.012 --> 05:56.945
She's just pointing out
that you have a history

05:56.947 --> 05:58.648
of hiding us bumpkins
in the attic

05:58.649 --> 06:00.281
when it's time
to meet the public.

06:00.283 --> 06:01.683
That is not true.

06:01.685 --> 06:02.985
Oh, please.

06:02.986 --> 06:05.221
The last parent-teacher
conference I even heard about

06:05.222 --> 06:07.222
was fifth grade.

06:07.224 --> 06:10.960
That's because
you would never wear underwear.

06:10.961 --> 06:15.330
You'd sit in those little desks,
showing it to the world.

06:16.733 --> 06:19.801
You got straight A's,
didn't you?

06:19.803 --> 06:21.836
Because I studied.

06:21.838 --> 06:24.039
We'll never know.

06:30.881 --> 06:34.316
Boy, those wasps really
got me good, huh?

06:34.317 --> 06:37.018
Well, at least I'll have a fun
story to tell at your party.

06:37.020 --> 06:39.587
Oh, maybe you shouldn't
tell that one.

06:39.589 --> 06:40.922
Why not?

06:40.924 --> 06:44.126
Mike, you got your ass kicked
by a bunch of wasps.

06:44.127 --> 06:45.361
I know. That's why it's funny.

06:45.362 --> 06:47.329
Besides, you know,
you get beat fair and square,

06:47.330 --> 06:49.230
you got to tip your hat
to the victor.

06:49.232 --> 06:52.000
Yeah, but are they laughing
with you or...

06:52.002 --> 06:54.303
Hey, laughing's laughing.
And they're gonna love the part

06:54.304 --> 06:56.672
where I Aqua Netted
Vince's eyelashes shut.

06:56.673 --> 06:58.374
(laughs)

06:58.375 --> 06:59.975
I wish I could've seen that.

06:59.976 --> 07:01.110
Yeah, so does Vince.

07:01.111 --> 07:02.678
(both laugh)

07:02.679 --> 07:04.180
Oh, yeah...

07:04.181 --> 07:06.382
You know what? I-I don't think
this is gonna be the...

07:06.383 --> 07:09.217
the kind of party where people
are telling stories and...

07:09.219 --> 07:12.221
I thought it was a party for
up-and-coming storytellers.

07:12.222 --> 07:13.723
It is, it is.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.324
But, you know, that's their job.

07:15.325 --> 07:18.327
They're off the clock.
Let's give 'em the night off.

07:18.328 --> 07:20.596
Well, I gotta talk
about something. Do you?

07:20.597 --> 07:21.896
What?
What?

07:21.898 --> 07:22.932
No,

07:22.933 --> 07:23.866
I'm-I'm just saying,

07:23.867 --> 07:25.468
these people are
so full of themselves,

07:25.469 --> 07:26.769
they're gonna do
most of the talking.

07:26.770 --> 07:28.537
You just have to sit there

07:28.538 --> 07:31.474
and listen and just pretend
to be interested. That's it.

07:31.475 --> 07:33.609
It's easy. I do it
with her all the time.

07:33.610 --> 07:34.844
Ma.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.412
No, she's-she's not wrong.

07:36.413 --> 07:37.445
A little mean,

07:37.447 --> 07:38.948
but not wrong.

07:38.949 --> 07:40.115
You know,

07:40.117 --> 07:41.283
these people just...

07:41.284 --> 07:42.818
they're always trying
to one-up you.

07:42.819 --> 07:44.886
It's not a conversation.
It's a competition.

07:44.888 --> 07:46.322
I got you.

07:46.323 --> 07:48.457
It's like when Carl starts
talking about R & B music.

07:48.458 --> 07:49.592
You know what I do?

07:49.593 --> 07:51.827
I rub my nose,
hinting that he has a booger.

07:51.828 --> 07:53.596
Then that's all
he can think about.

07:53.597 --> 07:55.564
Yeah, and then instead of
going on and on

07:55.565 --> 07:58.066
about Marvin Gaye's dad,
he's running for a napkin.

07:59.336 --> 08:00.469
Yeah, I... I don't know

08:00.470 --> 08:02.338
that these are
the types of people

08:02.339 --> 08:05.908
that you're gonna throw off
with a phantom booger.

08:05.909 --> 08:07.109
You know?

08:07.110 --> 08:09.111
They'll just assume
you have one.

08:09.112 --> 08:11.380
Which you kind of do,
by the way.

08:11.381 --> 08:12.715
Nah, that's just a big hair.

08:12.716 --> 08:15.651
I'll yank it in the parking
lot when we get there.

08:15.652 --> 08:17.352
Oh!

08:18.789 --> 08:20.955
Thanks, Ma.

08:27.831 --> 08:30.031
(quiet conversations)

08:31.935 --> 08:32.967
Oh.

08:32.969 --> 08:35.471
Uh, no railing.

08:35.472 --> 08:37.304
Very... very chic.

08:38.375 --> 08:40.142
There's no way this meets code.

08:40.143 --> 08:41.910
Ma, hold my arm.
I'm fine.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.445
Not for you; for me.

08:43.446 --> 08:46.080
This place is beautiful.

08:46.082 --> 08:47.883
You think they got
the game on somewhere?

08:47.884 --> 08:50.085
Mike, these kinds of people
don't watch television.

08:50.086 --> 08:52.187
If they ask, neither do we.

08:52.189 --> 08:53.455
How about a fish tank?

08:53.456 --> 08:55.257
Anything to look at?

08:55.258 --> 08:56.525
Well, this has been fun.

08:56.526 --> 08:58.393
Ready to go?
No.

08:58.395 --> 09:01.096
We gotta stick around until
the new author announcements.

09:01.097 --> 09:02.931
That's the whole reason we came.

09:02.933 --> 09:05.034
Fine. I got to get
a few drinks in me

09:05.035 --> 09:06.569
if they're gonna
parade me up and down

09:06.570 --> 09:08.503
like a shih tzu at a dog show.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.541
I think that statue just moved.

09:13.543 --> 09:15.544
That's because
it's a real person.

09:15.545 --> 09:17.513
No! Are you serious?

09:17.514 --> 09:18.747
Mike, leave him alone.

09:18.748 --> 09:20.683
Remember the robot cowboy
in the park?

09:20.684 --> 09:23.818
You kept blowing in his ear...
he didn't like it.

09:23.820 --> 09:25.621
Well, if you can't
stay in character,

09:25.622 --> 09:27.656
don't paint yourself silver.

09:27.657 --> 09:30.659
Oh, my God, I think
that's Jean Thompson.

09:30.660 --> 09:32.528
She wrote <i>The Year We Left Home.</i>

09:32.529 --> 09:35.130
Well, this will be the year
that I don't read that.

09:35.131 --> 09:36.298
She's coming this way.

09:36.299 --> 09:37.866
Maybe you should go
find your mother.

09:37.868 --> 09:38.968
All right, fine,
but I'll come back

09:38.969 --> 09:40.001
and rescue you if
she's as boring...

09:40.003 --> 09:41.170
Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine,
fine, fine.

09:41.171 --> 09:42.271
All right.

09:42.272 --> 09:43.972
(chuckles)

09:45.000 --> 09:51.074

09:52.282 --> 09:54.148
(exhales sharply)

09:55.018 --> 09:56.985
You're good.

09:59.022 --> 10:01.557
Not so fast.
What have we got here?

10:01.558 --> 10:03.025
Baked crab on wontons.

10:03.026 --> 10:04.326
Mmm. (chuckles)

10:04.327 --> 10:05.460
(loud crunch)

10:05.462 --> 10:07.229
(gags)

10:07.230 --> 10:10.732
Why didn't you tell me
it was real crab?

10:11.935 --> 10:13.402
Oh, what do we have here?

10:13.403 --> 10:16.605
Real crab.
All right, keep it moving.

10:16.606 --> 10:18.607
So this is your new crowd,
huh, Ma?

10:18.608 --> 10:21.443
You kidding? I'm only
here because I have to.

10:21.444 --> 10:24.380
I got nothing in common
with these poseurs,

10:24.381 --> 10:26.247
kissing each other's asses.

10:26.249 --> 10:27.716
Wait a minute.

10:27.717 --> 10:29.151
I think that's the lady

10:29.152 --> 10:31.287
who wrote <i> Crock-Pot
Confidential.</i>

10:31.288 --> 10:33.622
Oh, is that where you got
that tamale casserole recipe?

10:33.623 --> 10:36.057
Yep, yep, yep.
Bye, bye, bye.

10:41.564 --> 10:44.466
See, I didn't find the piece
so much about desolation

10:44.467 --> 10:46.267
as loneliness.
Mm-hmm.

10:46.269 --> 10:49.037
(crunches) I...

10:49.039 --> 10:51.407
I mean, what I...
what I was saying is that, uh,

10:51.408 --> 10:54.343
underneath it all,
it's really just a-a sobering

10:54.344 --> 10:57.246
account of the human condition.

10:57.247 --> 10:58.246
What is?

10:58.248 --> 10:59.982
We were just discussing

10:59.983 --> 11:02.584
her powerful short story.

11:02.585 --> 11:03.852
Oh, I love short stories!

11:03.853 --> 11:04.987
Better yet...
a minute mystery.

11:04.988 --> 11:06.855
Any of you guys ever
write one of those?

11:06.856 --> 11:08.290
I mean, I know I'm a cop,

11:08.291 --> 11:11.125
but I'm always surprised
by who did it.

11:11.127 --> 11:13.462
Ah, you are such a stitch!

11:13.463 --> 11:14.663
(both chuckle)

11:14.664 --> 11:16.097
Is this your husband?

11:16.099 --> 11:18.767
(quietly): Mm-hmm.

11:18.768 --> 11:20.635
Hey! Mike Biggs.

11:20.637 --> 11:22.871
Nice to meet you.
By the way, if you guys

11:22.872 --> 11:26.107
like mini-hamburgers,
highly recommended.

11:26.109 --> 11:28.309
Kind of in the middle
of a conversation.

11:28.311 --> 11:30.112
Well, if you eat
one of these babies,

11:30.113 --> 11:32.447
that's all you're
gonna be talking about.

11:32.449 --> 11:35.384
Anyway, uh, as I was saying,

11:35.385 --> 11:37.820
I-I really, um... uh...

11:37.821 --> 11:40.622
it... I think sometimes...
(groans, laughs)

11:40.623 --> 11:42.925
Now I don't remember
what I was talking about.

11:42.926 --> 11:45.326
We're talking
about these burgers.

11:45.328 --> 11:46.795
No, you were talking
about the burgers.

11:46.796 --> 11:48.364
We were talking about her...

11:48.365 --> 11:50.666
powerful and moving short story.

11:50.667 --> 11:52.100
MIKE: Hey, I got a story.

11:52.102 --> 11:53.469
Any of you guys
ever go toe-to-toe

11:53.470 --> 11:54.937
with a porch full of wasps, huh?

11:54.938 --> 11:56.138
You ought to see my back, man.

11:56.139 --> 11:57.338
It's like a strip
of bubble wrap.

11:57.340 --> 11:58.907
Goes all the way to here.

11:58.908 --> 12:00.509
Mike! Stop it!

12:00.510 --> 12:02.043
Don't be stupid.

12:03.713 --> 12:05.314
I mean...

12:05.315 --> 12:06.882
I mean silly.

12:06.883 --> 12:08.349
Yeah, I know what you meant.

12:08.351 --> 12:10.219
Mike.

12:10.220 --> 12:11.552
Excuse me.

12:11.554 --> 12:13.489
You were saying about my story?

12:13.490 --> 12:15.690
I don't know.
I didn't read it.

12:27.128 --> 12:28.562
Here.

12:28.563 --> 12:29.897
What's this?
It's the valet ticket.

12:29.898 --> 12:31.365
You and Molly take the car.

12:31.366 --> 12:32.466
I'm heading out.

12:32.467 --> 12:33.667
Oh! There you are.

12:33.668 --> 12:35.469
Yeah, I'm just leaving.

12:35.470 --> 12:37.171
Oh, come on.
Look.

12:37.172 --> 12:38.305
You don't want me here.

12:38.306 --> 12:39.473
I've already
embarrassed you enough.

12:39.474 --> 12:41.442
Just enjoy your party.

12:41.443 --> 12:44.078
But we're good, right?

12:44.079 --> 12:45.379
He'll be fine.

12:45.380 --> 12:47.081
By the way,
don't bother poking her ass.

12:47.082 --> 12:49.148
She's real.

12:53.121 --> 12:55.389
Yeah, and it was
a real snobby party, too.

12:55.390 --> 12:57.057
Real crab, fake people.

12:57.058 --> 12:59.026
I prefer it
the other way around.

12:59.027 --> 13:00.628
And Molly was putting
on airs like...

13:00.629 --> 13:02.463
like she was buying
into the whole thing.

13:02.464 --> 13:06.000
If it was just us, she would've
been making fun of it, too.

13:06.001 --> 13:09.915
See, I just can't believe
she called you stupid.

13:09.916 --> 13:11.049
Bossy.

13:11.051 --> 13:12.051
Blowhard.

13:12.052 --> 13:13.451
Cheap.
Moody.

13:13.453 --> 13:16.488
But not stupid, okay?

13:16.489 --> 13:19.658
Molly's got to understand
that words hurt.

13:19.659 --> 13:22.126
Thanks. You guys are
really cheering me up.

13:22.128 --> 13:24.362
And sarcastic!
That's another one that you are.

13:30.136 --> 13:32.171
Just giving you a heads-up.

13:32.172 --> 13:34.340
I might be writing
a book on cabbage

13:34.341 --> 13:36.108
with that Crock-Pot lady.

13:36.109 --> 13:37.776
I'll honor our deal first.

13:37.777 --> 13:40.446
I just wanted to put it
out in the open.

13:40.447 --> 13:43.549
Okay, for the record,
I did not say he was stupid.

13:43.550 --> 13:45.416
I was saying don't <i> be</i> stupid.

13:45.418 --> 13:47.152
Big difference.

13:47.153 --> 13:48.387
One is being mean,

13:48.388 --> 13:51.890
and the other is keeping him
from being stupid.

13:51.892 --> 13:53.259
So, it was him
you were worried about?

13:53.260 --> 13:54.393
Yes.

13:54.394 --> 13:57.061
What a good wife you are.

13:57.063 --> 13:59.632
I'm sorry, but those people
out there are judging us

13:59.633 --> 14:02.267
on every word we say
and every move we make.

14:02.269 --> 14:03.936
What do you care
what they think?

14:03.937 --> 14:06.772
Because this is part of the
world we live in now, Peggy...

14:06.773 --> 14:09.241
Chicago's literary elite...
and if we want to be successful,

14:09.242 --> 14:11.276
we better play the game.

14:11.278 --> 14:12.645
You play, I'll watch.

14:12.646 --> 14:13.645
Fine!

14:13.647 --> 14:15.047
This is a party
for up-and-comers?

14:15.048 --> 14:17.048
Well, here I come.

14:17.884 --> 14:19.918
Molly?

14:19.920 --> 14:20.953
What?

14:20.954 --> 14:22.655
Go get 'em.

14:22.656 --> 14:24.589
Thank you.

14:29.796 --> 14:31.430
All right,
this is the final question

14:31.431 --> 14:32.665
of the round, gentlemen.

14:32.666 --> 14:35.367
This deadly Twin is
their all-time home run leader.

14:35.368 --> 14:37.902
Harmon Killebrew...
573 home runs.

14:37.904 --> 14:39.305
(dings)

14:39.306 --> 14:40.706
(both grunt)

14:40.707 --> 14:41.941
That is correct!

14:41.942 --> 14:44.642
See? That big head isn't
just for big hats.

14:44.644 --> 14:45.911
(laughs)

14:45.912 --> 14:47.780
Yeah, I might not know
about books or art,

14:47.781 --> 14:49.848
but I can name
every Cub since 1954.

14:49.849 --> 14:52.117
I can also rebuild
any American-made car.

14:52.118 --> 14:54.153
And I can quote
practically every line

14:54.154 --> 14:56.521
Al Pacino has ever said on film.

14:56.523 --> 14:57.989
What about <i> Serpico?</i>

14:57.991 --> 15:00.592
"I'm a marked man
in this department."

15:00.593 --> 15:02.293
(all laugh)

15:02.295 --> 15:04.663
I've never seen it,
but I'm sure that's right.

15:04.664 --> 15:06.097
Yeah!

15:08.435 --> 15:09.468
Hey.

15:09.469 --> 15:11.736
Hey!
Hey!

15:14.975 --> 15:16.141
Hey!

15:16.142 --> 15:18.309
Hello.

15:19.980 --> 15:21.447
Can we talk?

15:21.448 --> 15:23.682
Go ahead, but just so you
know, we're in the middle

15:23.683 --> 15:26.385
of a pretty heated trivia game,
and-and believe it or not,

15:26.386 --> 15:28.219
I'm the brains of the group.

15:28.221 --> 15:30.088
Well, it doesn't surprise me.

15:30.090 --> 15:31.622
It shocked the hell out of us.

15:34.427 --> 15:36.595
You didn't think I was
too smart at that party.

15:36.596 --> 15:39.098
Oh, I wasn't too sure
of anything at that party.

15:39.099 --> 15:42.234
And after you left, it took
a pretty humiliating turn.

15:42.235 --> 15:45.536
And that's before I fell
off the stairs on the way out.

15:47.807 --> 15:50.108
At least the stairs
didn't call you stupid.

15:50.110 --> 15:52.510
No, but the statue did
when I knocked him over.

15:55.448 --> 15:57.582
Those guys have no
sense of humor.

15:58.518 --> 16:00.819
I'm sorry!
I-I was an idiot.

16:00.820 --> 16:03.622
And I just got nervous and
intimidated with those people.

16:03.623 --> 16:05.823
And I put it all on you.

16:05.825 --> 16:07.459
I get it.

16:07.460 --> 16:09.261
You forgive me?
On one condition.

16:09.262 --> 16:10.361
Anything.

16:10.363 --> 16:11.497
Can you join our trivia team?

16:11.498 --> 16:13.465
We're getting
our asses handed to us!

16:13.466 --> 16:15.534
Like I said...
I'm the smart one of the group.

16:15.535 --> 16:18.670
Hey, that's because
my category has not come up yet.

16:18.671 --> 16:20.739
Okay, uh, my area
of expertise is music.

16:20.740 --> 16:22.141
Specifically R & B.

16:22.142 --> 16:23.909
Did you know
that Marvin Gaye's father

16:23.910 --> 16:25.943
was an ordained minister
but never loved his son?

16:25.945 --> 16:28.246
Hmm? And you know...

16:28.248 --> 16:31.049
"Sit... Sittin' on..."

16:32.519 --> 16:34.453
"Sittin' on...
Sitti'' on the Dock of the...

16:34.454 --> 16:36.654
the Dock..." Excuse me.

16:39.159 --> 16:42.094
Hey, that works like a charm.

16:42.095 --> 16:44.362
Every time.

16:44.364 --> 16:46.431
(mutters quietly)

16:48.168 --> 16:49.168
Nah, I'm just kidding.

16:49.169 --> 16:51.402
Oh!
(laughs)

17:01.182 --> 17:02.615
Another party.

17:02.616 --> 17:04.983
Are you sure you want
me to go to this one?

17:04.984 --> 17:06.286
I am big. I am oafy.

17:06.287 --> 17:07.487
I like mini-hamburgers.

17:07.488 --> 17:09.455
And I like talking
about them even more.

17:09.457 --> 17:10.924
You can't embarrass me.

17:10.925 --> 17:12.625
I don't care
what those people think.

17:12.626 --> 17:15.428
Well, you should know
I'm planning on uncorking

17:15.429 --> 17:17.363
some new jokes
that I heard at work,

17:17.364 --> 17:18.998
and the ones
that aren't toilet-based...

17:18.999 --> 17:21.634
real dirty.

17:21.635 --> 17:23.936
Mike, you're going
to this party.

17:23.938 --> 17:26.205
Damn it. It was a lot easier
to get out of these things

17:26.207 --> 17:27.705
when you were ashamed of me.

17:27.708 --> 17:29.809
Look, I know this party
is gonna be horrible,

17:29.810 --> 17:33.580
but I wouldn't want to share
my misery with anybody but you.

17:33.581 --> 17:35.448
That's sweet.

17:35.449 --> 17:38.217
Oh, by the way, save Saturday
night for Carl's birthday.

17:38.219 --> 17:39.619
We're gonna watch
all three <i> Godfathers.</i>

17:39.620 --> 17:43.021
I'm gonna karaoke all
of Al Pacino's lines.

17:44.158 --> 17:46.726
You don't have to go tonight.

17:46.727 --> 17:48.394
Hoo-ha!

17:48.395 --> 17:49.895
Stupid like a fox!
