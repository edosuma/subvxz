00:48.300 --> 00:49.543
- Please put
your hands together

00:50.222 --> 00:52.017
for the guy you've been
waiting for all night,

00:52.017 --> 00:53.846
the amazing, the
funny, the awesome,

00:53.846 --> 00:57.264
my very good friend,
Mr. Nick Chambers.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.854
- Wow, thank you.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.408
Thank you, man, oh.

01:04.822 --> 01:08.827
You ever feel like you're
born in the wrong time period?

01:08.827 --> 01:10.277
I don't know, that's how I feel.

01:10.277 --> 01:12.072
Like everyone's trying
to do relationship things

01:12.072 --> 01:14.143
on these apps and
phones, things like that,

01:14.143 --> 01:16.214
but I feel like you gotta
do things face to face.

01:16.214 --> 01:20.218
It could be difficult if one
of those faces is this face.

01:21.943 --> 01:23.704
I think I was born in
the wrong time period.

01:23.704 --> 01:27.259
I wish I was back in
the 1920s and 1930s,

01:27.259 --> 01:29.744
back when all the lead singers
sounded like trombones.

01:30.711 --> 01:34.301
â™ª Oh baby let me talk to you

01:34.301 --> 01:35.992
You know that voice?

01:40.583 --> 01:41.791
- Hey come on,
smoke out of the window,

01:41.791 --> 01:43.033
you're gonna ash on your dress.

01:43.033 --> 01:44.518
- I'm not gonna ash on my dress.

01:44.518 --> 01:46.002
- Yes you are, and I paid
a lot of money for it,

01:46.002 --> 01:47.521
so don't mess it up.

01:47.521 --> 01:48.832
- Actually your
mother paid for this dress.

01:48.832 --> 01:50.593
- Same difference.

01:50.593 --> 01:52.698
- What are you 12?

01:52.698 --> 01:54.114
- Ugh, thank god.

01:56.909 --> 01:59.015
Kyle, I love you, but
you have too much family.

01:59.015 --> 02:00.292
- Preach.

02:00.292 --> 02:01.086
- Hey Ali.

02:01.086 --> 02:02.570
- Hi.

02:02.570 --> 02:03.537
- Your mother's trying to
redecorate our bedroom.

02:03.537 --> 02:04.814
- Yeah, she does that.

02:04.814 --> 02:07.610
- Oh, did my mom try to
Feng Shui the furniture?

02:07.610 --> 02:08.852
- I don't know.

02:08.852 --> 02:10.613
I left after they were
trying to determine

02:10.613 --> 02:14.858
whether the bed was
facing due north.

02:14.858 --> 02:15.997
Does one of you have gum?

02:15.997 --> 02:17.206
- Yeah.

02:17.206 --> 02:18.724
- How much longer
do we have to be here?

02:18.724 --> 02:21.106
- Uh well, considering it is
your party and your house,

02:21.106 --> 02:23.073
I would say a while.

02:23.073 --> 02:24.040
- Ugh, god.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.766
- Here, man.

02:25.766 --> 02:27.733
- I just wanna go get tacos.

02:27.733 --> 02:28.976
- Right?

02:28.976 --> 02:30.874
- Jesus you two
are lightweights.

02:30.874 --> 02:33.153
- That sounds amazing right now.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.223
- Could we do that?
- I mean--

02:34.223 --> 02:35.741
- Could we bail?

02:35.741 --> 02:37.329
- You just hop in the car and--

02:37.329 --> 02:40.781
- Listen, let's, let's
ignite this sedan, and just.

02:41.678 --> 02:43.163
Trailblaze.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.131
- I'm firing this
thing up right now.

03:38.252 --> 03:39.357
- Oh hi.
- Hi.

03:39.357 --> 03:41.290
- You're Kyle's cousin.

03:41.290 --> 03:42.808
- Uh yeah, I'm one of many.

03:42.808 --> 03:43.913
I'm Ali.

03:43.913 --> 03:45.673
- You're the matron of honor?

03:45.673 --> 03:47.779
- Oh no, no, I'm just
your standard bridesmaid,

03:47.779 --> 03:49.884
but the matron is Jill,

03:49.884 --> 03:51.886
the rather surly looking
woman in the corner

03:51.886 --> 03:53.163
with the two and
a half children.

03:53.163 --> 03:56.581
- I, I heard you're
quite a comedian.

03:56.581 --> 04:01.241
- That's what the fortune
cookies keep telling me, so.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.864
- Well, right, well, it's
nice talking with you.

04:03.864 --> 04:05.037
- Mm-hm, yeah.

04:07.316 --> 04:08.178
Okay.

05:32.780 --> 05:33.609
- Oh shit.

05:34.782 --> 05:35.749
Here comes trouble.

05:35.749 --> 05:36.750
- Hi, Danny.

05:38.268 --> 05:40.029
- Look at you, all fancy.

05:40.029 --> 05:41.306
- Oh, you like?

05:42.480 --> 05:43.515
- What's the occasion?

05:43.515 --> 05:45.862
- Wedding, pre-wedding.

05:45.862 --> 05:47.070
- Pre-wedding.

05:47.070 --> 05:48.589
- Yeah, it's the party
before the party.

05:48.589 --> 05:49.487
That's who they do it.

05:49.487 --> 05:51.351
- Is that right?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.111
How'd you know I'd be here?

05:53.111 --> 05:55.907
- Where else would you be?

05:55.907 --> 05:57.633
- You're calling me predictable?

05:57.633 --> 05:58.461
- Never.

06:00.808 --> 06:05.365
- Well, you went looking
for me and you found me, so.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.126
- Who said I was
looking for you?

06:09.369 --> 06:11.371
- Oh, she's cold.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.302
She's cold.

07:08.013 --> 07:09.877
- Hi, can I help you?

07:09.877 --> 07:12.328
- Yeah, is this
Writing for Comedy?

07:12.328 --> 07:14.848
- Are you Alma?

07:14.848 --> 07:15.849
- Ali, yeah.

07:17.367 --> 07:21.199
- Then this is Writing
for Comedy, come on in.

07:25.341 --> 07:29.172
All right, now that
everyone is here, welcome.

07:31.243 --> 07:35.247
Here is the syllabus
for the next few weeks.

07:35.247 --> 07:37.733
Please take one, pass it down.

07:42.496 --> 07:45.395
As Ali here has
just established,

07:45.395 --> 07:49.503
this is Writing for Comedy,
an eight-week course

07:49.503 --> 07:52.851
designed to give you
all professional careers

07:52.851 --> 07:54.474
in comedic writing.

07:55.509 --> 07:56.545
- Really?

07:56.545 --> 07:57.546
- No.

07:59.133 --> 08:01.688
You're here because you
need to learn how to write,

08:01.688 --> 08:05.208
and being good at
it comes much later.

08:05.208 --> 08:08.936
Okay, let's look at page
two of the syllabus.

08:10.248 --> 08:13.493
And let's look at week eight.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.391
A stand-up performance.

08:38.552 --> 08:41.072
- Oh my god, you look so good.

08:44.246 --> 08:45.559
Oh, if you look better than me,

08:45.559 --> 08:47.112
I'm gonna be so pissed.

08:47.112 --> 08:48.597
- Okay, nobody's gonna look
better than you, all right?

08:48.597 --> 08:50.668
And even if they do, just
throw some bridezilla shit.

08:50.668 --> 08:52.255
Throw 'em in the lake.

08:52.255 --> 08:53.912
- What lake?

08:53.912 --> 08:55.880
- Isn't there always a
lake at these things?

08:55.880 --> 09:00.505
You know, something for
the swans or the doves,

09:00.505 --> 09:02.576
or something with peace birds.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.371
- Have you ever actually
been to a wedding?

09:04.371 --> 09:05.545
- Is everyone happy here?

09:05.545 --> 09:07.719
- Yeah, fits like a glove.

09:07.719 --> 09:10.308
- Great, we also offer
steam and press package,

09:10.308 --> 09:12.241
so it's guaranteed to
be perfect on the day.

09:12.241 --> 09:13.863
- Oh yes, totally,
I'll go for that.

09:13.863 --> 09:16.521
- Hey, I'm paying for my dress.

09:16.521 --> 09:20.180
- Hey, this I just a bonus,
let me do this for you.

09:20.180 --> 09:21.595
- Could you excuse
us for one minute?

09:21.595 --> 09:22.562
- Sure.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.494
- Please, um, okay, so.

09:25.737 --> 09:28.395
So you know I love
Kyle, you know,

09:28.395 --> 09:32.537
he's like, he's more like a
brother than a cousin to me.

09:32.537 --> 09:34.228
You know, like most
of our bloodline,

09:34.228 --> 09:36.610
he's been dumber than a bag of
hammers for most of his life,

09:36.610 --> 09:38.647
which has been so much
better since he met you,

09:38.647 --> 09:40.580
and I'm thankful, and
I'm talking about me

09:40.580 --> 09:43.065
and most of the Massachusetts
State Police Department here,

09:43.065 --> 09:45.412
but you know, you've
already spent like,

09:45.412 --> 09:46.586
all of your savings,

09:46.586 --> 09:48.242
plus having to deal
with his crazy parents,

09:48.242 --> 09:52.108
and my psycho ass
mother, and um, you know,

09:52.108 --> 09:53.593
all 42 of our cousins,

09:53.593 --> 09:57.631
so just shut up about the dress
and let me pay for it, okay?

09:59.737 --> 10:02.360
- Yeah, bring it in
for the real thing.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.533
Come on, yeah.

10:08.366 --> 10:09.781
- We're hugging
in a bridal shop.

10:09.781 --> 10:10.955
- Yes, we are.

10:12.370 --> 10:16.132
And I really hope I don't
have to throw you in the lake.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.524
- Next time Big Jim
destroys the mens room,

10:28.524 --> 10:31.009
these waders are going to you.

10:32.079 --> 10:33.287
- Okay, well I'm not the one

10:33.287 --> 10:34.841
who gave him the
endless sub supreme.

10:34.841 --> 10:36.325
- Mm.

10:36.325 --> 10:37.982
- Hey can I ask a favor?

10:37.982 --> 10:38.810
- Shoot.

10:39.742 --> 10:41.054
- I need an advance.

10:41.054 --> 10:42.434
- How much?

10:42.434 --> 10:43.815
- Two week?

10:44.713 --> 10:46.266
- Ah, I can't do it.

10:46.266 --> 10:48.578
- You just gave Brendan
an advance like last week.

10:48.578 --> 10:50.891
- Yeah, his wife
just had a baby.

10:50.891 --> 10:54.205
- Okay, so I need to knock
out a kid to get a float.

10:54.205 --> 10:56.897
- No, but maybe if you started
doing your own routines

10:56.897 --> 10:58.278
like you keep telling
me you want to,

10:58.278 --> 11:00.487
then I could pay you more.

11:00.487 --> 11:01.833
- That's harsh.

11:01.833 --> 11:03.352
- Mm, you're okay though?

11:03.352 --> 11:05.181
You're not in trouble.

11:05.181 --> 11:07.080
- No, no it's just
there's like extra costs

11:07.080 --> 11:08.702
with the wedding, and I'm
taking this writing class.

11:08.702 --> 11:11.463
- What is it, a
punch up sorta thing?

11:11.463 --> 11:16.158
- No, no, it's like a
little more basic than that.

11:16.158 --> 11:16.986
- Nice.

11:19.299 --> 11:21.094
- So you gonna
give me the money?

11:21.094 --> 11:22.440
- No.

11:22.440 --> 11:23.924
- You're lame.

11:23.924 --> 11:26.547
- Look Al, if I had more
work, I'd give it to you.

11:26.547 --> 11:27.997
If I had more money,
I'd give it to you.

11:27.997 --> 11:29.654
But I don't, and there is none,

11:29.654 --> 11:31.967
so either start
doing your own sets,

11:31.967 --> 11:33.658
or get a second job.

11:38.111 --> 11:42.736
- Start doing your own
routines or get a second job.

11:42.736 --> 11:46.636
You can't even handle
my routines, fool.

11:51.572 --> 11:54.852
- I heard a rumor that we're
gonna see you up there tonight.

11:54.852 --> 11:56.439
- Mm-hm, oh really?

11:56.439 --> 11:57.682
- Oh yeah.

11:57.682 --> 12:00.133
Super credible source,
never one to lie.

12:00.133 --> 12:00.927
- Mm-hm.

12:03.136 --> 12:05.759
- You pissed at me or something?

12:05.759 --> 12:06.933
- I'm working.

12:09.452 --> 12:11.247
- Matt's right, you know.

12:11.247 --> 12:12.904
If you start doing your own sets

12:12.904 --> 12:14.285
instead of checking everyone in,

12:14.285 --> 12:15.562
you could make some more money.

12:15.562 --> 12:17.012
- Okay Brendan, let's
just forget for a second

12:17.012 --> 12:18.358
that I didn't really need
Matt telling everyone

12:18.358 --> 12:19.842
that I'm strapped for cash,

12:19.842 --> 12:22.086
but I don't even really
wanna do stand up anymore.

12:22.086 --> 12:23.052
You know?

12:23.052 --> 12:24.260
I'm over it.

12:24.260 --> 12:26.228
- Is that why you're
taking writing classes?

12:26.228 --> 12:27.574
- Okay, quit it.

12:30.128 --> 12:32.544
- Listen, if you're
that hard up for money,

12:32.544 --> 12:35.030
my neighbor needs help moving.

12:36.859 --> 12:39.517
- I was thinking something
a little more long term.

12:39.517 --> 12:40.967
- No, no, no, you
don't understand.

12:40.967 --> 12:45.385
She's got a bad knee, and
she has to use a cane.

12:45.385 --> 12:47.214
So she needs someone to
help pack up all her stuff

12:47.214 --> 12:49.561
before she can get someone
in to sell the place.

12:49.561 --> 12:54.428
- Well that sounds charming,
but I'm not a mover, so.

12:54.428 --> 12:55.567
- Fine.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.741
Suit yourself.

13:01.919 --> 13:03.092
- You know that?

13:03.092 --> 13:04.335
- I think I'm funny.
- I, I think--

13:04.335 --> 13:05.129
- Gotta love
the Wednesday night

13:05.129 --> 13:06.268
fuck face special.

13:06.268 --> 13:07.959
You want to?

13:07.959 --> 13:09.202
- No.

13:09.202 --> 13:10.479
- You suck.

13:10.479 --> 13:11.411
- Yeah, I
suck, that's great.

13:11.411 --> 13:12.446
- You suck.

13:12.446 --> 13:13.723
- I suck.
- Go make me a sandwich.

13:13.723 --> 13:15.208
- Sir, you
have to leave right now.

13:15.208 --> 13:17.210
- No really, I paid four
dollars, I'm not leaving.

13:17.210 --> 13:18.452
- That's an
awful lot of comedy

13:18.452 --> 13:20.109
brought to you by
this gentleman.

13:20.109 --> 13:21.731
Thank you, good night.

13:21.731 --> 13:23.906
Have a nice night.

13:23.906 --> 13:28.083
- Okay, beautiful,
wow, that was intelligent.

13:34.883 --> 13:35.780
- Hey girl.

13:35.780 --> 13:37.092
- Hey, what's up.

13:37.092 --> 13:38.610
- Not much.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.371
Maggie and I are about to
hit up this warehouse party

13:40.371 --> 13:41.613
at Southbridge.

13:41.613 --> 13:44.271
- Southbridge, shit, that's far.

13:45.686 --> 13:47.171
- Oh, we can pick you
up if you wanna come with.

13:47.171 --> 13:48.241
Are you home?

15:12.152 --> 15:13.153
- Ali!

15:30.101 --> 15:31.447
- Stop it.

15:32.655 --> 15:34.416
- Oh good, you're up.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.108
- Why?

15:38.972 --> 15:40.146
Get off of me!

15:41.354 --> 15:43.977
- Somebody went partying.

15:43.977 --> 15:46.152
- Yeah well, the
night was still young.

15:46.152 --> 15:49.396
- I thought you said you
were going home after work.

15:49.396 --> 15:50.501
- Well, I changed my mind.

15:50.501 --> 15:51.502
What do you want?

15:51.502 --> 15:54.332
- Help me write my vows.

15:54.332 --> 15:56.886
- Dude, they're your vows,
why don't you write them?

15:56.886 --> 15:58.233
- I'm not a writer.

15:58.233 --> 15:59.717
- Okay well, I'm
not a vow writer.

15:59.717 --> 16:01.650
- Now you're not that bad, Ali.

16:02.651 --> 16:05.343
Come on, I'll buy you brunch.

16:05.343 --> 16:06.413
Come on, come on, come on.

16:06.413 --> 16:08.760
- Fine, leave me alone!

16:08.760 --> 16:10.417
- That's the spirit.

16:13.489 --> 16:15.629
Ooh, you might
wanna get something

16:15.629 --> 16:18.425
to cover up that
hangover, like a,

16:18.425 --> 16:20.600
like a burqa or something.

16:24.638 --> 16:26.399
Chip chop, chip chop!

16:35.511 --> 16:38.790
Amy.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.758
I find I'm so excited that
I can barely hold still

16:40.758 --> 16:43.209
or hold a thought in my head.

16:43.209 --> 16:44.555
I think it's the excitement

16:44.555 --> 16:46.419
only a soon-to-be-married
man can feel.

16:46.419 --> 16:48.076
A man at the start
of a long journey

16:48.076 --> 16:50.009
whose conclusion is uncertain.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.596
I hope I can make it
across the border.

16:51.596 --> 16:55.152
I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.

16:56.912 --> 17:01.020
I hope the Pacific is as
blue as it has been in my.

17:02.159 --> 17:03.815
Are you quoting The
Shawshank Redemption?

17:03.815 --> 17:07.957
- I believe in two things,
discipline and the Bible.

17:07.957 --> 17:09.718
- What am I gonna write?

17:09.718 --> 17:11.237
- You know, that
is a beloved film.

17:11.237 --> 17:12.721
- I'm not quoting the
Shawshank Redemption

17:12.721 --> 17:13.963
in my own wedding.

17:13.963 --> 17:15.034
- Well what
do you wanna write?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.276
- I don't know.

17:16.276 --> 17:18.623
You know, I thought this
would be the easy part.

17:18.623 --> 17:20.039
- I don't think there
is an easy part.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.040
- I just, I want to
find a way to say

17:22.040 --> 17:24.422
like you know, she's my one.

17:24.422 --> 17:26.424
She like my other hippo.

17:27.874 --> 17:29.324
- Your other hippo.

17:29.324 --> 17:31.567
- Yeah, 'cause you know, they
like, they mate for life.

17:31.567 --> 17:33.949
- No Kyle, that's penguins.

17:33.949 --> 17:35.399
- Whatever.

17:35.399 --> 17:37.297
It's just like, I used
to be kind of a dumbass--

17:37.297 --> 17:38.574
- You used to be
kind of a dumbass.

17:38.574 --> 17:39.403
- Shut up.

17:40.956 --> 17:42.164
Amy makes me better, you know?

17:42.164 --> 17:43.545
She sees the kind
of person I could be

17:43.545 --> 17:45.719
and she makes me
want to be that.

17:45.719 --> 17:48.481
She believes in
me, she knows me,

17:49.896 --> 17:51.173
she won't let me
give up on myself,

17:51.173 --> 17:54.038
she pushes me to be better.

17:54.038 --> 17:57.766
I still feel like I can
be myself around her.

17:57.766 --> 17:59.975
Like, like it doesn't come
from this place of judgment

17:59.975 --> 18:02.391
it comes from a place of love.

18:04.013 --> 18:06.947
I never had that
with anybody else.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.709
- Dude, write that down.

18:09.709 --> 18:12.021
- That's just me talking.

18:12.021 --> 18:13.816
- Yeah, but that's what's good.

18:13.816 --> 18:15.266
People don't wanna hear you say

18:15.266 --> 18:18.545
I promise to love you
and treasure you forever.

18:18.545 --> 18:21.307
They wanna hear something real.

18:21.307 --> 18:22.549
The best shit always comes out

18:22.549 --> 18:24.724
when you're not
thinkin' about it.

18:24.724 --> 18:26.726
- See, you are a writer.

18:27.727 --> 18:29.970
- Ugh, god I feel like ass.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.733
- That's my Ali,
class all the way.

18:33.733 --> 18:35.631
Ooh, I gotta go pick up my tux.

18:35.631 --> 18:37.668
You wanna come with?

18:37.668 --> 18:40.912
- Mm no, I think I've had
enough excitement for one day.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.121
- Thanks.

18:42.121 --> 18:42.983
- Yeah.

19:46.426 --> 19:47.255
- 52.50.

19:49.774 --> 19:50.775
- Seriously?

19:52.018 --> 19:53.502
- Yeah, seriously.

20:13.315 --> 20:14.178
Sign here.

20:49.386 --> 20:50.249
- Shit.

21:10.890 --> 21:11.891
Hey Brendan.

21:41.334 --> 21:42.577
Hi, this is 30?

21:44.648 --> 21:46.891
- You're Brendan's girl?

21:46.891 --> 21:48.721
- Yeah, I guess.

21:50.550 --> 21:52.069
- What's in that bag?

21:52.069 --> 21:53.657
- Oh, it's records.

21:54.554 --> 21:56.349
- What, like vinyl?

21:56.349 --> 21:58.593
- Yeah, I just bought them.

21:59.559 --> 22:02.044
- Why did you bring me records?

22:02.044 --> 22:03.977
- No, I, sorry, I didn't.

22:03.977 --> 22:06.877
They're for me, I
just bought them.

22:09.362 --> 22:10.225
- I see.

22:13.090 --> 22:15.264
- Can I come in now?

22:16.300 --> 22:17.128
- I guess.

22:31.073 --> 22:35.250
I've taken the liberty of
assembling some boxes for you.

22:42.395 --> 22:45.502
- Wow, you
have a lot of stuff.

22:47.227 --> 22:48.332
- If it's gonna be
too much for you,

22:48.332 --> 22:50.472
I can get someone else.

22:50.472 --> 22:53.268
- No, no, it's
fine, I can do it.

22:54.269 --> 22:55.650
- So you'll start in here.

22:55.650 --> 22:57.652
This is my sitting room.

22:59.032 --> 23:01.897
Probably take you
a couple of days.

23:04.969 --> 23:09.146
- Um, is there any particular
order you want me to follow?

23:10.147 --> 23:11.390
- Are you one of those people

23:11.390 --> 23:14.393
that needs everything
spelled out for them?

23:14.393 --> 23:15.255
- No.

23:16.256 --> 23:17.396
- Good.

24:59.670 --> 25:01.569
I don't recall
paying you to read.

25:01.569 --> 25:02.431
- Sorry.

25:03.743 --> 25:05.020
You wrote this?

25:06.194 --> 25:10.301
- That's my picture
on the back, isn't it?

25:10.301 --> 25:12.062
I think that's enough for today.

25:12.062 --> 25:12.890
I'm tired.

25:14.098 --> 25:17.032
I'd like you to start a
little earlier tomorrow.

25:17.032 --> 25:18.551
- Yeah, I get out
of class at one.

25:18.551 --> 25:20.588
- Okay, that's fine.

25:20.588 --> 25:21.865
What are you studying?

25:21.865 --> 25:23.038
- Comedy.

25:23.038 --> 25:24.695
How to write comedy.

25:25.869 --> 25:29.286
- They can teach a
person to be funny?

25:29.286 --> 25:31.322
- They can try.

25:31.322 --> 25:32.392
- So they do.

25:36.327 --> 25:39.503
- Would you mind if
I borrow the book?

25:42.575 --> 25:46.027
- As long as you read
it on your own time.

25:46.027 --> 25:48.616
You can burn it for all I care.

25:56.106 --> 25:59.385
- All right, each of you
has homework for this week.

25:59.385 --> 26:01.767
Things to do, write
it down please.

26:01.767 --> 26:05.425
I want you to write 10
jokes a day, new ones.

26:05.425 --> 26:07.082
New ones, they don't
have to be great,

26:07.082 --> 26:09.050
they just have to
be 10 jokes a day.

26:09.050 --> 26:10.534
It's a good habit to get into.

26:10.534 --> 26:12.053
YouTube your favorite comedian.

26:12.053 --> 26:14.711
Find out what works, what
doesn't work, take notes.

26:14.711 --> 26:19.267
Five responses to the phrase,
he's so old, dot dot dot,

26:19.267 --> 26:20.509
what are you gonna put for that?

26:20.509 --> 26:21.752
Try to be original
with those, please.

26:21.752 --> 26:24.997
And finally, I want you
to go to a comedy show.

26:24.997 --> 26:28.069
Any show, it doesn't matter.

26:28.069 --> 26:30.589
Watch, listen, observe, learn.

26:35.835 --> 26:37.354
And please bring
me your ticket stub

26:37.354 --> 26:39.701
or else I'll know you're lying,

26:39.701 --> 26:40.875
and that will undermine

26:40.875 --> 26:43.671
our already very
fragile relationship.

26:45.983 --> 26:47.191
Okay, that's it for today.

26:47.191 --> 26:48.883
I have your sketches
from last week,

26:48.883 --> 26:52.472
so come pick 'em up on
your way out, thanks.

26:52.472 --> 26:53.715
Good.

26:53.715 --> 26:54.820
I don't know.

26:55.786 --> 26:57.236
Not bad, not bad.

26:58.202 --> 27:00.515
You guys are gettin' better.

27:01.999 --> 27:03.760
Gettin' better, okay.

27:18.947 --> 27:19.776
- Sorry.

27:28.888 --> 27:31.442
- Something on your mind, Ali?

27:31.442 --> 27:33.790
- You went a little
pen happy on my sketch.

27:33.790 --> 27:35.550
- That's my job.

27:35.550 --> 27:37.310
- It's a good sketch.

27:38.311 --> 27:40.797
But you don't think it is.

27:40.797 --> 27:43.040
- Do you want my honest opinion?

27:43.040 --> 27:44.628
- Well it looks like I
got a paragraph of 'em,

27:44.628 --> 27:46.181
so what's one more?

27:47.182 --> 27:49.288
- It's very flat.

27:49.288 --> 27:50.738
- Flat.

27:50.738 --> 27:52.601
- Yeah, look.

27:52.601 --> 27:54.155
The set up's good, the
characters are good,

27:54.155 --> 27:56.122
you've got good delivery--

27:56.122 --> 27:56.951
- But?

27:58.400 --> 28:00.609
- You're being lazy.

28:00.609 --> 28:01.887
- Sorry I asked.

28:01.887 --> 28:04.579
- Ali, I've read
your writing samples.

28:04.579 --> 28:07.720
I know you can do
better, so go do it.

28:40.719 --> 28:43.722
- Your sitting room's done.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.758
- Is it?

28:45.758 --> 28:47.277
- You wanna check?

28:48.140 --> 28:50.142
- Not really, no.

28:53.283 --> 28:56.700
You can start on the upstairs
bedroom, to the right.

28:56.700 --> 28:58.184
Top of the stairs.

29:01.429 --> 29:02.982
- I like your book.

29:04.673 --> 29:06.917
- Did you finish it?

29:06.917 --> 29:08.091
- Uh, not yet.

29:09.402 --> 29:13.579
- I'd reserve
judgment until the end, then.

29:21.898 --> 29:22.830
You can go.

29:48.510 --> 29:49.339
- Shit.

30:54.473 --> 30:57.648
Joshua, the man, the
myth, the legend.

30:58.822 --> 31:01.273
I was wondering what
you are doing right now

31:01.273 --> 31:03.413
because I was just celebrating
my cousin's wedding,

31:03.413 --> 31:06.416
and I think that
we should hang out,

31:09.764 --> 31:11.593
so I should come over.

31:13.595 --> 31:15.045
No, okay.

31:15.045 --> 31:17.323
Yeah, yeah some other time.

31:18.290 --> 31:19.118
Okay, bye.

31:31.993 --> 31:33.581
Hey Asha, it's Ali.

31:35.721 --> 31:38.758
I'm fuckin', I'm out and about.

31:38.758 --> 31:42.038
Uh so, you know, give me a call.

31:42.038 --> 31:45.248
I wanna hear about
that Southbridge party,

31:45.248 --> 31:46.076
so um.

31:47.629 --> 31:49.631
Yeah, you know, call me.

31:51.771 --> 31:52.600
Bye.

32:03.197 --> 32:05.026
John, my favorite, hi.

32:07.546 --> 32:08.478
So I think.

32:09.686 --> 32:13.483
I think that you should
let me come over, okay?

32:17.866 --> 32:19.247
Yeah?

32:19.247 --> 32:20.076
Okay.

32:21.180 --> 32:23.631
Okay, I'll see you soon, bye.

33:30.111 --> 33:31.285
Just a second.

34:05.698 --> 34:06.941
- Lost earring?

34:08.356 --> 34:09.771
- Lost speech, hey, have
you seen a piece of paper.

34:09.771 --> 34:10.772
- Did you write it?

34:10.772 --> 34:12.257
- Excuse me?

34:12.257 --> 34:13.810
- Did you write the speech
that you're lookin' for.

34:13.810 --> 34:15.018
- Yeah.

34:15.018 --> 34:16.847
- Oh, well then you
already know it.

34:16.847 --> 34:18.608
- Okay, thanks guy
at bar I don't know

34:18.608 --> 34:23.268
for your sage wisdom, but
I need to find this thing.

34:23.268 --> 34:25.132
- It's stuck to your shoe.

34:25.132 --> 34:25.994
- What?

34:28.687 --> 34:30.309
How long were you gonna let
me keep looking for that?

34:30.309 --> 34:34.072
- Only until it
stopped being amusing.

34:34.072 --> 34:34.934
- Asshole.

34:37.282 --> 34:39.179
- So after about three
hours being duct taped

34:39.179 --> 34:42.183
in the back of this
trunk, it opens up,

34:42.183 --> 34:45.806
and there's Kyle with that
big goofy grin of his,

34:45.806 --> 34:49.362
just smiling, being like hey,
hope you like Celine Dion

34:49.362 --> 34:51.295
because we're in Canada.

34:52.813 --> 34:56.991
So Amy, thank you so much for
domesticating him, really.

34:56.991 --> 34:59.097
That's enough from me.

34:59.097 --> 35:02.169
I'm gonna hand it over
now Kyle's cousin Ali,

35:02.169 --> 35:04.032
who, if you don't
know her already,

35:04.032 --> 35:05.275
you're gonna love her, so.

35:05.275 --> 35:06.518
Ali, everybody.

35:15.803 --> 35:16.907
- Hi.

35:16.907 --> 35:17.908
Hi, I'm Ali.

35:20.048 --> 35:23.293
As many of you know,
Kyle is my cousin.

35:24.467 --> 35:26.917
But he's also my best friend,

35:28.678 --> 35:30.680
and okay, so real quick.

35:35.857 --> 35:39.999
Um, so growing up, when
I was a little kid,

35:39.999 --> 35:41.829
I was terrified of spiders,

35:41.829 --> 35:44.866
and I don't know, I was
like deathly afraid of them,

35:44.866 --> 35:47.006
and I think I watch
Arachnophobia too many times

35:47.006 --> 35:49.768
when I was like
five, but anyway,

35:49.768 --> 35:51.597
I was just convinced that they
would come out of the walls

35:51.597 --> 35:54.669
and attack me when I was asleep,

35:54.669 --> 35:57.224
so Kyle used to sleep
over all the time,

35:57.224 --> 36:00.158
and one day, we
had this big party,

36:01.504 --> 36:03.264
and all the neighborhood
kids were there,

36:03.264 --> 36:06.750
and somehow, one
of them found out

36:06.750 --> 36:08.718
I was afraid of these spiders

36:08.718 --> 36:13.136
and decided to go digging
around in the back yard

36:13.136 --> 36:16.001
and fine one and throw it on me,

36:16.001 --> 36:20.868
so I was like crying and
crying, and Kyle found out,

36:20.868 --> 36:24.492
and then he went and
found the kid who did it

36:24.492 --> 36:28.324
and smacked him in the face
with a jug of Kool-Aid,

36:28.324 --> 36:31.085
so anyway, it was
this whole thing,

36:31.085 --> 36:32.845
and later that night,

36:35.262 --> 36:38.161
after both of our parents were
done tearin' him a new one,

36:38.161 --> 36:41.578
Kyle slept over and he
checked the entire basement

36:41.578 --> 36:43.994
for spiders, and he said Ali,

36:46.169 --> 36:49.241
you're afraid of
spiders right now,

36:49.241 --> 36:51.243
but you won't always be,

36:52.693 --> 36:56.317
and right now it's okay
to be afraid of something,

36:57.801 --> 37:01.909
so when he met Amy, I was
like, she better be awesome,

37:03.255 --> 37:05.568
because Kyle's been
keeping away the spiders

37:05.568 --> 37:09.675
all these years, and
whoever he ends up with

37:09.675 --> 37:13.852
has to be equally as cool,
so it turns out, actually,

37:15.336 --> 37:17.959
that Kyle is afraid of heights,

37:17.959 --> 37:20.203
roller coasters to be specific,

37:20.203 --> 37:24.690
and sorry Kyle, I'm kind
of gonna out you, here.

37:24.690 --> 37:28.211
But um, so there was this
like big company picnic,

37:28.211 --> 37:31.145
and I just tagged along,
and that's how I met Amy,

37:31.145 --> 37:34.873
and I was like okay, things
are gettin' kind of serious,

37:34.873 --> 37:37.013
I better size her up.

37:37.013 --> 37:41.189
So um, so everyone wanted to
go on this huge death drop

37:45.677 --> 37:48.162
megaton roller coaster,

37:48.162 --> 37:52.235
and Kyle looked like
he was gonna throw up,

37:52.235 --> 37:56.757
so all of his co-workers
were making fun of him

37:56.757 --> 38:00.312
and everything and that's
when Amy jumped in,

38:00.312 --> 38:02.866
and she said she felt sick,

38:02.866 --> 38:05.524
and that she needed to sit down,

38:06.870 --> 38:10.357
and someone went and
got her some water,

38:10.357 --> 38:14.257
and Kyle sat with her, while
everyone else went on the ride,

38:14.257 --> 38:18.882
and that's when I realized
that she did for him

38:18.882 --> 38:23.231
what he had done for me
because she knew he was scared

38:23.231 --> 38:25.303
and she knew it was okay,

38:30.411 --> 38:33.587
and she didn't want
him to feel alone,

38:36.555 --> 38:38.557
so um, Kyle and Amy, um.

38:41.767 --> 38:45.530
To whatever crazy shit
life may throw at you,

38:47.117 --> 38:49.706
I know you guys will be
there to lie for one another

38:49.706 --> 38:52.778
or smack somebody with a
jug of Kool-Aid, I love you.

39:44.658 --> 39:45.866
Ah!

39:45.866 --> 39:47.108
- Jesus.

39:47.108 --> 39:48.247
- God, what are you doing?

39:48.247 --> 39:49.732
- What are you doing?

39:51.389 --> 39:53.943
- God, I feel like I'm dying.

39:53.943 --> 39:56.014
- I think you're
having a panic attack.

39:56.014 --> 39:57.567
- A what?

39:57.567 --> 39:58.396
- Um.

40:00.432 --> 40:01.847
Can you sit down?

40:01.847 --> 40:04.609
- No, no, I don't
wanna sit down.

40:14.964 --> 40:16.414
- Here, hold this.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.484
- It's ice.

40:17.484 --> 40:18.726
- It's gonna help.

40:18.726 --> 40:19.658
- Are you a doctor?

40:19.658 --> 40:21.764
- Just hold the ice, here.

40:37.227 --> 40:38.056
Better?

40:40.058 --> 40:40.886
- Yeah.

40:42.474 --> 40:43.337
- Here.

40:46.927 --> 40:48.653
- You're the guy.

40:48.653 --> 40:50.827
You're the guy with my shoe.

40:50.827 --> 40:55.004
- That's what they call
me, the guy with the shoe.

40:55.832 --> 40:57.593
- Are you a guest?

40:57.593 --> 40:58.456
- No.

40:59.802 --> 41:01.597
- A florist?

41:01.597 --> 41:02.874
- I was filling in for a friend,

41:02.874 --> 41:04.462
I was playing the
wedding upstairs.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.809
- Ah, so you're
in a wedding band.

41:06.809 --> 41:09.984
- Part time.

41:12.400 --> 41:13.954
You feelin' better?

41:15.749 --> 41:17.854
- I feel like I need a
drink the size of my arm.

41:17.854 --> 41:18.683
- Uh-huh.

41:20.201 --> 41:22.169
- Do I look like a Monet?

41:22.169 --> 41:25.655
- Yeah, but most
people like Monet.

41:25.655 --> 41:27.450
- You're weird.

41:27.450 --> 41:30.902
- You're the one
giving speeches about spiders.

41:30.902 --> 41:32.282
- Oh, you were watching me.

41:32.282 --> 41:35.527
- Yeah, well I had
to see how it ended.

41:36.908 --> 41:40.705
Hey, how about we
get you that drink?

41:40.705 --> 41:44.778
- Yeah, well if you're
buying, I'm not saying no.

41:50.577 --> 41:52.268
- So what do you do?

41:54.995 --> 41:56.514
- Why do you care?

41:57.549 --> 42:00.448
- Are you always this hostile?

42:00.448 --> 42:04.522
- Well, I'm a comedian,
so we're born hostile.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.453
- That explains
your speech then.

42:05.453 --> 42:08.664
You can tell you're a performer.

42:08.664 --> 42:12.046
- Do you enjoy dissecting
people you just met?

42:12.046 --> 42:14.497
- Part time surgeon,
part time musician.

42:14.497 --> 42:15.705
- Sounds messy.

42:20.986 --> 42:24.369
- So how much longer
is your wedding?

42:24.369 --> 42:27.027
- Do you have somewhere to be?

42:27.027 --> 42:29.443
- Venues just feel like work.

42:31.859 --> 42:32.860
- Wait here.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.422
- Ali!

42:45.183 --> 42:46.149
Hi babe.

42:46.149 --> 42:47.634
- Oh.

42:47.634 --> 42:50.913
- Ali baby, I promise, I'll
always check for spiders.

42:50.913 --> 42:51.741
- I know.

42:52.880 --> 42:54.813
Hey, I think I'm
gonna get outta here.

42:54.813 --> 42:56.159
- Hey come on, you know,
things are winding down.

42:56.159 --> 42:57.126
We can just relax.

42:57.126 --> 42:58.299
- No, I think I'm just tired.

42:58.299 --> 43:01.509
But hey, I'll see you tomorrow.

43:01.509 --> 43:02.407
- You suck.

43:02.407 --> 43:03.270
- Ah, I love you.

43:03.270 --> 43:04.202
- You suck.

43:08.206 --> 43:09.310
What is this?

43:47.763 --> 43:48.626
- Hey.

43:49.730 --> 43:51.007
Hey.

43:51.007 --> 43:52.837
I've been here before.

43:56.944 --> 43:57.773
Come on.

43:59.913 --> 44:03.261
I think I've definitely
been here before.

44:29.356 --> 44:31.289
Are you somebody's dad?

44:32.186 --> 44:33.015
- No.

44:34.188 --> 44:36.052
What made you think of that?

44:36.052 --> 44:37.916
- I don't know.

44:37.916 --> 44:41.023
You're like kind of dad-like.

44:41.023 --> 44:43.784
You got like a
dad vibe going on.

44:46.545 --> 44:49.997
- Is that your way
of saying I look old?

44:49.997 --> 44:51.481
- Older.

44:51.481 --> 44:52.310
- Hm.

44:53.380 --> 44:54.484
Are you someone's mom?

44:54.484 --> 44:57.867
- That's funny.

45:01.664 --> 45:03.079
I had a dad once.

45:04.011 --> 45:05.633
He was a funny man.

45:07.014 --> 45:08.360
- He a comedian?

45:08.360 --> 45:10.742
- Mm-hm, he's a local legend.

45:12.675 --> 45:15.367
- Like father, like daughter.

45:15.367 --> 45:17.024
- Yeah.

45:17.024 --> 45:19.924
I'm probably gonna
make it past 36.

45:26.033 --> 45:30.210
I'm sorry, I don't know
why I'm talking about this.

45:38.459 --> 45:40.323
- Do you wanna get outta here?

45:40.323 --> 45:41.152
- Yeah.

46:07.626 --> 46:08.766
Um, I'm sorry.

46:11.251 --> 46:12.252
- It's okay.

46:14.081 --> 46:15.358
I'm sorry, too.

46:28.371 --> 46:29.614
- What?

46:29.614 --> 46:30.788
- So you blew off the
rest of our wedding

46:30.788 --> 46:33.756
to stand in the dark
being held by some guy?

46:33.756 --> 46:35.793
- It was actually kind of nice.

46:35.793 --> 46:38.381
And you know, I didn't blow
you guys off or anything.

46:38.381 --> 46:39.658
- But nothing
else happened?

46:39.658 --> 46:41.177
- Nope.

46:41.177 --> 46:44.008
We just stood there for a while,

46:44.008 --> 46:46.734
and then he made up
a bed on the couch,

46:46.734 --> 46:48.806
and I fell asleep on him.

46:49.910 --> 46:50.842
- Who is this guy?

46:50.842 --> 46:52.119
- Are you gonna see him again?

46:52.119 --> 46:53.949
- I don't know, I
don't know, maybe.

46:53.949 --> 46:55.226
- I don't like it.

46:55.226 --> 46:56.779
This has bad ending
written all over it.

46:56.779 --> 46:59.782
- Thank you for that
vote of confidence, Kyle.

46:59.782 --> 47:00.714
- Anytime.

47:00.714 --> 47:02.820
- I think it's super sweet.

48:04.329 --> 48:05.434
- Ali!

48:07.160 --> 48:07.988
Ali!

48:09.748 --> 48:12.303
Can you come down here, please?

48:14.236 --> 48:16.583
- How the fuck did she know?

48:23.245 --> 48:24.073
- Yes?

48:25.557 --> 48:29.251
- Go into the desk in the
hallway and get me a pen.

48:32.288 --> 48:34.187
- You called me
down here for a pen?

48:34.187 --> 48:36.914
- I seem to
have run out of ink.

48:36.914 --> 48:40.020
- Well why can't
you get it yourself?

48:46.751 --> 48:47.579
Right.

49:16.436 --> 49:19.887
- My, my, what an
attitude we have today.

49:23.167 --> 49:24.754
- What's your deal?

49:25.928 --> 49:27.274
- My deal?

49:27.274 --> 49:28.689
- Yeah.

49:28.689 --> 49:30.036
Why are you moving,
where are you going,

49:30.036 --> 49:32.417
were you living with someone?

49:32.417 --> 49:35.351
- How is any of
that your business?

49:38.561 --> 49:40.287
- And what's with the sandwich?

49:40.287 --> 49:42.082
- Oh, so now my
lunch offends you?

49:42.082 --> 49:43.946
- You never eat it.

49:43.946 --> 49:44.878
Every time I see you in here,

49:44.878 --> 49:46.914
you have an uneaten sandwich.

49:46.914 --> 49:48.916
What, just what is that?

49:51.091 --> 49:52.403
- Is there a specific reason

49:52.403 --> 49:54.646
why you're behaving like this,

49:54.646 --> 49:58.996
or is this some kind
of a nervous breakdown?

49:58.996 --> 50:01.964
- Lady, you've done nothing
but say nasty shit to me

50:01.964 --> 50:04.277
since I walked in this
house, and I deal with it

50:04.277 --> 50:06.693
because I need the job,
and you deal with it

50:06.693 --> 50:08.005
because it would
be to inconvenient

50:08.005 --> 50:09.661
to hire someone else
and start all over,

50:09.661 --> 50:11.042
and you don't strike me

50:11.042 --> 50:13.044
as someone who deals
well with inconvenience,

50:13.044 --> 50:16.565
so enlighten me, what's
with the sandwich?

50:19.361 --> 50:20.948
- Did you finish my book yet?

50:20.948 --> 50:21.777
- Oh god.

50:29.095 --> 50:33.271
- My husband used to have a
sandwich for lunch every day.

50:34.479 --> 50:35.791
- So is he--

50:35.791 --> 50:37.379
- Dead?

50:37.379 --> 50:39.312
Oh no, very much alive.

50:41.072 --> 50:43.592
I'm not a fan of new routines.

50:46.319 --> 50:49.563
Have your teachers
made you funny, yet?

50:53.188 --> 50:54.879
- I'm working on it.

50:56.881 --> 51:00.505
- Well, I'm looking
forward to the progress.

51:10.860 --> 51:12.103
- I'm just gonna keep on
coming back to that show.

51:12.103 --> 51:13.898
Even if I don't have to
bring my stubs to class,

51:13.898 --> 51:16.659
I'm going to see
that show every week.

51:16.659 --> 51:18.144
- Well they have
different people there--

51:18.144 --> 51:19.076
- I thought it was once
a month, or once a week--

51:19.076 --> 51:22.113
- Yeah, the company rotates.

51:22.113 --> 51:23.252
- Oh--
- The company rotates

51:23.252 --> 51:24.633
so it has improvisors
once a month,

51:24.633 --> 51:26.083
it's very confusing.

51:26.083 --> 51:27.084
- Some of those
guys, I think, do stand up too.

51:27.084 --> 51:28.085
- Do they?

51:28.085 --> 51:29.741
- I think so.

51:29.741 --> 51:31.640
There is, like other than the
video we saw before we went,

51:31.640 --> 51:32.917
I can't find.

51:32.917 --> 51:34.125
I'll look for like
individual things.

51:38.164 --> 51:40.442
- All right, you all had
an assignment last week

51:40.442 --> 51:41.926
to go see a comedy show,

51:41.926 --> 51:43.686
and I asked you to
bring in your tickets,

51:43.686 --> 51:46.241
so please bring up your
tickets, tickets please.

51:46.241 --> 51:47.587
Tickets, please.

51:50.900 --> 51:51.729
Thanks.

51:52.695 --> 51:54.111
Thank you.

51:54.111 --> 51:54.939
Thank you.

51:57.424 --> 51:58.943
All right, thanks.

52:05.950 --> 52:06.778
Ali?

52:08.159 --> 52:09.022
- Yes?

52:09.954 --> 52:11.438
- Do you have your ticket?

52:11.438 --> 52:12.646
- Um, no.

52:12.646 --> 52:13.475
I lost it.

52:17.272 --> 52:18.445
- You lost it.

52:21.310 --> 52:23.243
Well, what did you see?

52:24.727 --> 52:26.557
- I saw the Bomb Show.

52:29.111 --> 52:31.044
- The Bomb Show, right.

52:31.976 --> 52:32.908
How was it?

52:34.737 --> 52:36.325
- It was explosive.

52:39.915 --> 52:41.399
- Glad to hear it.

52:45.507 --> 52:49.959
And when you find your
ticket, you can come back.

52:49.959 --> 52:52.030
And tell us all about it.

52:54.378 --> 52:56.725
- Are you kidding me?

52:56.725 --> 52:59.659
- If I was kidding,
you would know.

53:53.264 --> 53:54.783
- Hi.

53:54.783 --> 53:56.440
Is this a good time?

53:59.926 --> 54:01.341
To your rehearsal.

54:06.035 --> 54:08.245
Oh okay, where should I go?

54:31.233 --> 54:32.441
- See you guys.

54:47.663 --> 54:50.079
Oh-ho-ho, my audience of one.

54:51.460 --> 54:54.118
- You know, I had assumed
you played the guitar.

54:54.118 --> 54:56.948
- Yeah well,
assumption is a trap.

55:00.227 --> 55:01.988
I also do play guitar.

55:03.300 --> 55:04.301
- I knew it.

55:12.895 --> 55:15.726
Why did you move to Boston?

55:15.726 --> 55:17.486
- I like the winters.

55:18.522 --> 55:21.041
- Nobody likes the winters.

55:21.041 --> 55:23.320
Even the Eskimos are lying.

55:24.769 --> 55:28.877
- Spot opened up to play, and
I needed a change of scenery.

55:32.087 --> 55:32.915
- Boring.

55:33.951 --> 55:36.125
- Sorry to disappoint you.

55:38.231 --> 55:40.440
- I'll find a way to go on.

55:42.925 --> 55:45.065
- So tell me your jokes.

55:45.065 --> 55:46.653
- My jokes?

55:46.653 --> 55:48.966
- Yeah, your act or whatever
you like to call it.

55:48.966 --> 55:49.794
- Ooh, no.

55:50.933 --> 55:52.521
Cardinal sin, dude.

55:53.557 --> 55:54.385
It's like.

55:56.422 --> 55:57.699
You can't ask that,

55:57.699 --> 56:01.323
it'd be like me asking
you to play right now.

56:01.323 --> 56:03.912
- I got no problem with that.

56:03.912 --> 56:05.569
- Fine, bad example.

56:16.959 --> 56:18.375
- See?

56:18.375 --> 56:20.515
Now I'm a proper audience.

56:23.138 --> 56:24.519
- Okay, well it doesn't.

56:24.519 --> 56:26.659
I can't just do it, it
doesn't work like that.

56:26.659 --> 56:29.213
- Well how does it work?

56:29.213 --> 56:31.146
- Why are you so
on me about this?

56:31.146 --> 56:33.942
- Why are you so defensive?

56:33.942 --> 56:35.668
- Okay.

56:35.668 --> 56:37.290
- Aw come on, you're
that easily upset?

56:37.290 --> 56:38.602
- I'm not upset.

56:42.847 --> 56:44.608
- Have you ever done it?

56:44.608 --> 56:46.230
- Done what?

56:46.230 --> 56:48.888
- Stood up on stage and perform?

56:57.414 --> 56:58.276
- No.

57:03.834 --> 57:04.938
- Stay there.

57:11.186 --> 57:13.360
See, now you're not alone.

57:15.293 --> 57:16.363
- Very funny.

57:19.574 --> 57:21.507
- What are you afraid of?

57:21.507 --> 57:23.923
- I'm not afraid of anything.

57:25.372 --> 57:26.857
- Now who's lying?

57:56.956 --> 57:58.613
You look miles away.

58:04.411 --> 58:06.413
Can I ask you something?

58:08.485 --> 58:10.245
If going up on stage
is so hard for you,

58:10.245 --> 58:12.178
why do you wanna do it?

58:16.769 --> 58:19.634
- I don't think I
know anything else.

58:19.634 --> 58:23.085
- 'Cause of
your dad or something?

58:24.570 --> 58:27.089
- My mom says I look like him.

58:28.470 --> 58:29.609
It's the eyes.

58:31.646 --> 58:33.510
We have the same eyes.

58:35.719 --> 58:37.997
- Was she a comedian?

58:37.997 --> 58:39.239
- No.

58:39.239 --> 58:42.001
No, my mom was a
cocktail waitress.

58:43.209 --> 58:44.486
Guess how they met?

58:44.486 --> 58:45.901
- That old chestnut.

58:45.901 --> 58:46.730
- And how.

58:47.972 --> 58:50.147
What are you parents like?

58:51.528 --> 58:53.875
- What were my parents like?

58:57.326 --> 59:01.261
My father was also
a musician, trumpet.

59:01.261 --> 59:02.918
He taught, he wrote.

59:04.092 --> 59:07.405
I think a little part
of him was tortured.

59:12.928 --> 59:15.759
And my mom left when I was six,

59:15.759 --> 59:17.830
so I never really
got to know her.

59:17.830 --> 59:18.762
- She left?

59:19.659 --> 59:20.522
- Mm-hm.

59:22.317 --> 59:24.284
She said she was gonna
do some shopping,

59:24.284 --> 59:26.286
and she never came back.

59:27.598 --> 59:29.048
- Where'd she go?

59:30.843 --> 59:32.120
- I don't know.

59:34.260 --> 59:36.434
I spent a long, long
time looking for her,

59:36.434 --> 59:40.162
and trying to figure
out why she left.

59:40.162 --> 59:42.579
I needed an answer,
but over time,

59:42.579 --> 59:46.721
I found out that sometimes
no answer is an answer.

59:49.551 --> 59:51.380
- I fucking hate that.

59:52.623 --> 59:54.798
No answer is just selfish.

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.953
- So is Ali a nickname?

01:00:12.988 --> 01:00:15.266
Can I get the full version?

01:00:16.509 --> 01:00:17.337
- Alma.

01:00:19.029 --> 01:00:22.929
- You don't usually
get Ali from Alma.

01:00:22.929 --> 01:00:25.622
- You don't usually get an Alma.

01:00:29.591 --> 01:00:32.836
- I like it, it's
pretty, it suits you.

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:37.288
- Maybe I don't wanna be pretty.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:23.307
You had a lot of adventures.

01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:25.792
- Pardon?

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:29.003
- I saw your photo albums.

01:04:31.281 --> 01:04:33.179
- That was nosy of you.

01:04:36.148 --> 01:04:39.047
- You seemed really
happy in the photos.

01:04:39.047 --> 01:04:40.738
- Yes, I did.

01:04:43.224 --> 01:04:46.054
- Saying you weren't
really happy?

01:04:47.573 --> 01:04:51.853
- You were looking at the
photos, what do you think?

01:04:51.853 --> 01:04:53.406
- I think you were.

01:04:54.821 --> 01:04:57.410
You just don't want to
admit it to yourself.

01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:58.929
- Oh?

01:04:58.929 --> 01:04:59.792
- Mm-hm.

01:05:04.210 --> 01:05:07.386
- I was happy in
many of those photos.

01:05:08.559 --> 01:05:12.943
But often, I was lonely
and sad in them, too.

01:05:12.943 --> 01:05:16.636
I like to think I had a
good picture-taking face.

01:05:16.636 --> 01:05:19.122
I was good at taking pictures.

01:05:21.331 --> 01:05:23.505
Why do you wanna be funny?

01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:26.508
- I can't help what I am.

01:05:26.508 --> 01:05:28.510
- What you are is cocky.

01:05:33.377 --> 01:05:34.206
- My dad.

01:05:35.655 --> 01:05:38.072
My dad was a comedian.

01:05:38.072 --> 01:05:39.418
- Was?

01:05:39.418 --> 01:05:40.315
- Dead.

01:05:40.315 --> 01:05:41.972
- Ooh, sorry.

01:05:41.972 --> 01:05:43.215
- It's a long time ago.

01:05:43.215 --> 01:05:46.114
- And you take after him?

01:05:46.114 --> 01:05:46.943
- I guess.

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:48.116
- Not your mother.

01:05:48.116 --> 01:05:50.705
- No, not at all.

01:05:50.705 --> 01:05:53.604
- You don't like her.

01:05:53.604 --> 01:05:55.537
- I can't relate to her.

01:05:55.537 --> 01:05:57.954
She doesn't make
any sense to me.

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.887
It's like we're two
different animals.

01:06:00.887 --> 01:06:02.096
- That must've been difficult

01:06:02.096 --> 01:06:05.720
growing up with a mother
you don't understand.

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.618
- Well I didn't say I
don't understand her.

01:06:07.618 --> 01:06:09.034
- You didn't have to.

01:06:09.034 --> 01:06:12.209
Never underestimate
the power mothers have

01:06:12.209 --> 01:06:14.556
over their children's lives.

01:06:16.558 --> 01:06:20.735
- My mother really had much
power, so I think I'm good.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.807
- Hm, maybe that's it, then.

01:06:23.807 --> 01:06:26.844
Maybe that's what scares you.

01:06:26.844 --> 01:06:28.881
- You think I'm scared
of becoming my mother?

01:06:28.881 --> 01:06:33.161
- No, I think you're scared
because you know you won't.

01:06:33.161 --> 01:06:35.612
You're gonna be a woman who
was nothing like her mother,

01:06:35.612 --> 01:06:37.476
and that just means that
everything about adulthood

01:06:37.476 --> 01:06:38.649
is an unknown.

01:06:40.099 --> 01:06:41.238
You didn't see an example of it

01:06:41.238 --> 01:06:43.171
that looked or felt like you,

01:06:43.171 --> 01:06:47.762
and that means you're doing
everything yourself, first hand.

01:06:47.762 --> 01:06:50.627
You're re-learning what
it means to be female

01:06:50.627 --> 01:06:55.011
because you couldn't be like
the person presented to you.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:56.495
You want to be like your father,

01:06:56.495 --> 01:06:59.636
but you can't be your father
because you're not a man.

01:06:59.636 --> 01:07:01.500
That's what scares you.

01:07:02.949 --> 01:07:04.365
- It's bullshit.

01:07:04.365 --> 01:07:05.676
You know, I'm just
taking my check.

01:07:05.676 --> 01:07:08.334
- Oh, so it's okay
to dig into my life,

01:07:08.334 --> 01:07:11.682
but you know, we touch on
yours, and someone gets mad.

01:07:11.682 --> 01:07:13.029
- Sorry I asked.

01:07:21.382 --> 01:07:23.280
- What's good, mama?

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.488
- If I hear this
act one more time,

01:07:24.488 --> 01:07:26.766
I'm gonna blow my
brains out, so that's.

01:07:26.766 --> 01:07:28.665
- I've got a surprise for you.

01:07:28.665 --> 01:07:29.907
- I'm not in the mood.

01:07:29.907 --> 01:07:33.221
- Trust me, you're
gonna wanna see this.

01:07:44.094 --> 01:07:46.510
- What am I looking at?

01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:48.788
- That's Joan's ex-husband.

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:51.584
- What, where?

01:07:51.584 --> 01:07:54.415
- And that lady
is their neighbor.

01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:57.038
- No shit.

01:07:57.038 --> 01:07:58.212
- Insane, right?

01:07:58.212 --> 01:08:01.249
Left her for the lady
across the street.

01:08:01.249 --> 01:08:03.355
- They live across the street?

01:08:03.355 --> 01:08:06.703
- Nah, they moved to some new
house in Concord or something,

01:08:06.703 --> 01:08:08.153
but it's rough.

01:08:08.153 --> 01:08:10.155
They were married for like
35 years or something.

01:08:10.155 --> 01:08:12.433
And one day he just dipped.

01:08:17.334 --> 01:08:19.024
Where are you going?

01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:38.725
Hmm, well she's smart,
I'll give her that.

01:09:39.622 --> 01:09:41.004
- I think you're obsessed.

01:09:41.004 --> 01:09:42.316
- I'm not obsessed.

01:09:42.316 --> 01:09:44.214
- You read her
entire back catalog.

01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:45.457
- Well I just.

01:09:45.457 --> 01:09:46.872
I just want to know
what happened to her.

01:09:46.872 --> 01:09:48.770
I wanna know why she's so angry.

01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:50.013
- You're angry.

01:09:51.152 --> 01:09:52.359
- It's a different
kind of angry.

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:53.568
- Hm.

01:09:53.568 --> 01:09:56.675
- She's so set in
her ways, she's just.

01:09:58.021 --> 01:09:59.264
She's not justified,

01:09:59.264 --> 01:10:00.403
she's already done all
the things in her life

01:10:00.403 --> 01:10:01.576
she wants to do.

01:10:01.576 --> 01:10:04.476
- She's got some years on you.

01:10:04.476 --> 01:10:05.304
- Yeah.

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:10.102
You know what else I saw today?

01:10:10.102 --> 01:10:11.690
- What?

01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:15.418
- There's an open mic
night at the school,

01:10:15.418 --> 01:10:16.867
it's like a student thing.

01:10:16.867 --> 01:10:18.869
- Oh, daring to be bold.

01:10:20.146 --> 01:10:21.044
- Possibly.

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:25.497
- And when is this
possible open mic?

01:10:25.497 --> 01:10:27.084
- Possibly next Thursday.

01:10:27.084 --> 01:10:29.259
- And what if I were to
possibly show up at this thing,

01:10:29.259 --> 01:10:32.883
would you find that
to be supportive?

01:10:32.883 --> 01:10:36.128
- Possibly.

01:10:40.822 --> 01:10:43.411
- Ah shit, I have a wedding.

01:10:43.411 --> 01:10:44.688
- On a Thursday?

01:10:44.688 --> 01:10:48.140
- Yeah, I don't book
'em, I just play them.

01:10:49.521 --> 01:10:51.488
- It's okay, I wasn't
gonna do it anyway.

01:10:51.488 --> 01:10:52.972
It's just a dumb student thing.

01:10:52.972 --> 01:10:55.734
- No, but it's your
dumb student thing.

01:10:55.734 --> 01:10:56.700
- Thanks a bunch.

01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:58.046
- No, you know what I mean.

01:10:58.046 --> 01:10:59.565
I'll find a way to be there.

01:10:59.565 --> 01:11:00.808
- Come on, you
gotta get up there,

01:11:00.808 --> 01:11:01.809
you gotta show 'em
you got some moxie.

01:11:01.809 --> 01:11:03.293
- Moxie.

01:11:03.293 --> 01:11:05.261
Easy there, coach.

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:06.710
- Yeah, well if you don't do it,

01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:09.092
I'm gonna give you shit
about it until you're dead.

01:11:09.092 --> 01:11:11.267
- Oh you're so loving.

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:12.440
- Mm-hm.
- You're so kind, aw.

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.062
- I'm a pusher man.

01:11:19.689 --> 01:11:21.691
- Top five, go.

01:11:21.691 --> 01:11:25.281
- Pryor, Hicks, Carlin,
Dangerfield, Lewis.

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.285
- Fuck, Lewis, I
should've had him in mine.

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:32.598
- All right, I'll give
you Dangerfield and Pryor,

01:11:32.598 --> 01:11:34.186
but you're missing
Eddie Murphy, man.

01:11:34.186 --> 01:11:36.464
- No wait, we're
doing pre-'86, right?

01:11:36.464 --> 01:11:37.603
- Eddie Murphy was pre-'86.

01:11:37.603 --> 01:11:39.053
- No.
- Yes.

01:11:39.053 --> 01:11:41.745
His first album, uh, Delirious.

01:11:41.745 --> 01:11:44.300
- Delirious, yeah, yeah.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.613
- Eddie Murphy,
1983, read and weep.

01:11:47.613 --> 01:11:49.235
- Okay, I'm changing mine now.

01:11:49.235 --> 01:11:53.309
If we're doing pre-'86,
Adrian Herring.

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:54.206
- Love him.

01:11:54.206 --> 01:11:55.690
- Who?

01:11:55.690 --> 01:11:56.657
- Adrian Herring.

01:11:56.657 --> 01:11:58.969
Seriously how do you not know?

01:11:58.969 --> 01:12:01.351
That guy was like the
comedy king of Boston.

01:12:01.351 --> 01:12:03.940
- That dude was the man.

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:04.768
- RIP.

01:12:06.425 --> 01:12:08.324
- Didn't he die in a car
accident or something?

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.325
- I'm lookin' it up.

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:10.602
- No, I remember him now.

01:12:10.602 --> 01:12:11.982
He had cancer.

01:12:11.982 --> 01:12:13.605
- Heroin.

01:12:13.605 --> 01:12:15.641
- That's right, it
was a heroin overdose.

01:12:15.641 --> 01:12:18.334
This guy was a secret
smack addict for years.

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:19.335
- What an idiot.

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:20.543
- Hey, have some respect.

01:12:20.543 --> 01:12:23.269
- Why, that guy had
everything, he was huge,

01:12:23.269 --> 01:12:25.341
and he threw it all away.

01:12:29.103 --> 01:12:33.072
- You let them talk that
way about your papa?

01:12:33.072 --> 01:12:34.522
- She speaks?

01:12:34.522 --> 01:12:36.110
- Wait, whose papa?

01:12:37.905 --> 01:12:38.906
- Holy shit.

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:41.840
- What?

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.600
- Dude, it's the eyes.

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.878
It's the fucking eyes.

01:12:45.878 --> 01:12:48.640
- Will someone tell
me what is going on?

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.159
- That's his daughter, stupid.

01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:57.890
- It's the voice.

01:12:57.890 --> 01:13:00.376
You got the same voice as him.

01:13:01.791 --> 01:13:04.241
- Why didn't you
tell us you were royalty?

01:13:04.241 --> 01:13:05.381
- I'm not.

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:06.692
- The fuck you aren't.

01:13:06.692 --> 01:13:08.487
My dad sells tires, all right?

01:13:08.487 --> 01:13:09.971
I work at a 7-Eleven.

01:13:09.971 --> 01:13:11.387
You're the daughter
of a comedy legend.

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:13.561
What are you doing
in this class,

01:13:13.561 --> 01:13:16.184
this shit's in your blood man.

01:13:16.184 --> 01:13:18.704
- What are you
doing in this class.

01:13:18.704 --> 01:13:19.981
- You say one more word to me,

01:13:19.981 --> 01:13:21.638
and I'm gonna kick your
teeth down your throat.

01:13:24.365 --> 01:13:25.849
- My children, my children,

01:13:25.849 --> 01:13:29.094
I hope you're all
hungry for the verse.

01:13:29.094 --> 01:13:31.027
- Ali, leaving so soon?

01:13:32.062 --> 01:13:33.305
- Come on, Ali, don't go.

01:13:33.305 --> 01:13:35.238
- Ali, I'll talk
about my dad, too.

01:13:35.238 --> 01:13:36.377
He's weird as shit.

01:13:36.377 --> 01:13:37.309
- Mine, too.

01:13:37.309 --> 01:13:38.655
We all have weird dads,

01:13:38.655 --> 01:13:40.795
that's like a prerequisite
for this class.

01:13:40.795 --> 01:13:42.797
Own your weird dad shit.

01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:47.492
- You can all go
fuck yourselves.

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:54.731
- You look different today.

01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:57.872
- The bedroom's finished.

01:14:57.872 --> 01:14:59.633
What do you want me to do next?

01:14:59.633 --> 01:15:01.497
- You can do this room.

01:15:02.636 --> 01:15:04.810
- There's hardly
anything in here.

01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:08.987
- Well you can start with
these and put them in the box.

01:15:23.311 --> 01:15:24.727
Who made you cry?

01:15:25.831 --> 01:15:26.660
- No one.

01:15:30.836 --> 01:15:34.184
- So I take it they haven't
made you funny, yet.

01:15:34.184 --> 01:15:36.359
Pity, I was looking
forward to hearing a joke.

01:15:36.359 --> 01:15:38.154
- Well I don't have
any jokes, okay?

01:15:38.154 --> 01:15:40.156
I don't have anything to
say, I've got nothing.

01:15:40.156 --> 01:15:42.468
I just wanna sit
here and not think

01:15:42.468 --> 01:15:43.884
and then get out of here.

01:15:43.884 --> 01:15:45.126
- Then where are you gonna go?

01:15:45.126 --> 01:15:46.611
- I don't know.

01:15:46.611 --> 01:15:47.853
Out.

01:15:47.853 --> 01:15:48.785
- That gonna make
you feel better?

01:15:48.785 --> 01:15:51.132
- Will you stop doing that?

01:15:51.132 --> 01:15:52.617
Stop examining me.

01:15:54.204 --> 01:15:56.103
I'm not one of the people
in your book, okay?

01:15:56.103 --> 01:15:57.863
You just can't study me.

01:15:57.863 --> 01:16:00.107
- Of course I can.

01:16:00.107 --> 01:16:02.350
I've studied everyone,
you're not different.

01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:04.214
- Oh, so you're gonna teach
me about life or something?

01:16:04.214 --> 01:16:05.077
Is that it?

01:16:05.077 --> 01:16:06.216
Are you the alchemist?

01:16:06.216 --> 01:16:08.460
- Finish the book.

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:10.186
- Finish the book,
yeah, yeah, I know.

01:16:10.186 --> 01:16:14.293
You're making me like it
less and less, you know.

01:16:15.363 --> 01:16:17.952
I read your articles, you know?

01:16:17.952 --> 01:16:19.436
You're very smart,

01:16:19.436 --> 01:16:22.301
you don't need to keep
shoving it down my throat.

01:16:22.301 --> 01:16:24.614
I don't think I need to
finish your one and only book

01:16:24.614 --> 01:16:26.685
to get what you're about.

01:16:31.690 --> 01:16:35.867
- Finish this room and then
you can go home for the day.

01:17:29.334 --> 01:17:30.646
- What the fuck?

01:17:41.795 --> 01:17:44.660
- Oh good, you finished it.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.178
- Yeah, lady.

01:17:46.178 --> 01:17:47.732
Lady, I thought you were
just standard crazy,

01:17:47.732 --> 01:17:52.668
but now I realize that you
are the deluxe version.

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:53.772
What is this?

01:17:59.364 --> 01:18:00.606
I see now for the first time

01:18:00.606 --> 01:18:02.574
that solely looking
through the others

01:18:02.574 --> 01:18:05.128
has left me blind
to my own heart.

01:18:05.128 --> 01:18:07.510
I have shut myself up living
inside the minds of those

01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:09.201
I've spent so long
trying to understand

01:18:09.201 --> 01:18:12.411
that I've begun to feel
disconnected from my own life.

01:18:12.411 --> 01:18:14.655
I imagine this is
what Dorothy felt like

01:18:14.655 --> 01:18:17.244
realizing everything she
wanted was in her own backyard.

01:18:17.244 --> 01:18:19.556
If only she'd looked
around to see it.

01:18:19.556 --> 01:18:23.043
It was always there
waiting, looking back.

01:18:24.147 --> 01:18:25.666
So that's it.

01:18:25.666 --> 01:18:29.808
You spent seven years and
like 500 pages to figure out

01:18:29.808 --> 01:18:33.881
that studying other
people taught you nothing.

01:18:33.881 --> 01:18:35.400
- So you liked it?

01:18:36.815 --> 01:18:39.300
- Did you
just take your meds?

01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:41.026
- Sit down.

01:18:41.026 --> 01:18:42.096
Oh, sit down.

01:18:48.551 --> 01:18:49.863
When I was your age.

01:18:49.863 --> 01:18:50.795
- Oh Jesus.

01:18:52.555 --> 01:18:54.281
- Do you want an
explanation or not?

01:18:54.281 --> 01:18:55.109
- Yeah.

01:18:56.317 --> 01:18:59.976
- When I was your age, I
had a dream, a fantasy.

01:19:01.081 --> 01:19:04.153
I dreamed of being a scientist.

01:19:04.153 --> 01:19:05.982
I dreamed of traveling the world

01:19:05.982 --> 01:19:10.159
and immersing myself in other
people, in other cultures.

01:19:11.608 --> 01:19:16.096
I would watch them, and
I would learn about them,

01:19:16.096 --> 01:19:18.857
and I would understand them.

01:19:18.857 --> 01:19:21.135
People, all of the people.

01:19:21.135 --> 01:19:24.000
I would figure out
what made them tick.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.177
I saw a beautiful, interesting,
fascinating life before me.

01:19:33.734 --> 01:19:36.530
And then, I got to the
end of my research,

01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:39.844
and I realized that
I felt like a fraud.

01:19:44.745 --> 01:19:47.541
I had been preaching about
connection and vulnerability

01:19:47.541 --> 01:19:51.234
but I didn't have those
things in my life.

01:19:51.234 --> 01:19:53.719
I had avoided being
present in my own life,

01:19:53.719 --> 01:19:57.862
in my own experiences,
controlling and predicting,

01:19:59.864 --> 01:20:01.382
that was my world.

01:20:04.075 --> 01:20:05.904
And so I made the
decision to try to change

01:20:05.904 --> 01:20:09.666
to try to follow what I
had witnessed to be true.

01:20:09.666 --> 01:20:11.737
Vulnerability is crucial.

01:20:14.706 --> 01:20:17.088
And I did change for a while.

01:20:19.918 --> 01:20:21.437
But then little by little,

01:20:21.437 --> 01:20:25.061
I fell back into old habits,
old ways of doing things.

01:20:26.511 --> 01:20:28.754
More comfortable, familiar.

01:20:31.999 --> 01:20:36.176
And in the end, I cheated
myself out of real love.

01:20:41.043 --> 01:20:43.045
Being present in one's life,

01:20:43.045 --> 01:20:45.116
being seen in one's life,

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.774
that makes us vulnerable,
and it's terrifying,

01:20:48.774 --> 01:20:50.155
but you've got to do it.

01:20:50.155 --> 01:20:52.433
Otherwise you end up alone.

01:20:54.021 --> 01:20:55.574
- So you just, you
wrote a whole book

01:20:55.574 --> 01:21:00.269
just to tell people not
to bother with each other.

01:21:00.269 --> 01:21:02.202
- I wrote the book because
I wanted to teach people

01:21:02.202 --> 01:21:04.273
about connection,
but the truth is,

01:21:04.273 --> 01:21:06.654
you cannot lose
yourself in other people

01:21:06.654 --> 01:21:09.554
without ultimately
coming up empty,

01:21:10.727 --> 01:21:14.524
feeling like you're
not really there.

01:21:14.524 --> 01:21:16.872
You're living life
at arm's length,

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:19.012
and the stories you wanna
tell, they don't feel real

01:21:19.012 --> 01:21:23.533
because you're not living
in the essence of them.

01:21:23.533 --> 01:21:27.227
You should know that,
you're a storyteller.

01:21:27.227 --> 01:21:29.988
- Yeah, but I don't live my life

01:21:29.988 --> 01:21:32.163
by observing other people.

01:21:33.854 --> 01:21:37.547
- Isn't general observation
the basis of most comedy?

01:21:37.547 --> 01:21:38.341
- Yeah.

01:21:39.204 --> 01:21:40.033
- So.

01:21:42.863 --> 01:21:44.071
Did you ever stop to think

01:21:44.071 --> 01:21:46.902
that maybe you and
I do the same thing?

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:48.834
- No, I don't.

01:21:48.834 --> 01:21:52.114
- Okay, let me ask
you this, then.

01:21:52.114 --> 01:21:55.186
Why did you wanna read this
book in the first place?

01:21:55.186 --> 01:21:56.773
And more importantly,
why are you so angry

01:21:56.773 --> 01:21:58.361
at the way it ends?

01:22:04.436 --> 01:22:06.162
- I'm not doing this.

01:22:07.992 --> 01:22:09.372
- That's a good idea.

01:22:09.372 --> 01:22:10.926
Go and sleep on it.

01:22:28.564 --> 01:22:29.979
- Are you looking for Sean?

01:22:29.979 --> 01:22:31.636
- Yeah.

01:22:31.636 --> 01:22:34.570
- I just saw him
leave with his sister.

01:22:34.570 --> 01:22:35.674
- His sister.

01:23:18.579 --> 01:23:21.237
- Uh, but it's been really hard.

01:23:22.859 --> 01:23:26.311
- Well, I'm here for you.

01:23:26.311 --> 01:23:27.864
I really am.

01:23:27.864 --> 01:23:29.245
- Really?

01:23:38.668 --> 01:23:39.497
Promise?

01:23:40.567 --> 01:23:41.395
- Yes.

01:23:52.958 --> 01:23:54.546
Hey, sorry.

01:23:54.546 --> 01:23:55.858
- Where were you?

01:23:55.858 --> 01:23:56.721
- I had a wedding.

01:23:56.721 --> 01:23:57.756
- All day?

01:23:57.756 --> 01:23:59.137
- Yeah, I don't know, I just.

01:23:59.137 --> 01:24:01.553
- You're up next.

01:24:01.553 --> 01:24:03.210
- Shit.
- Come on, come on.

01:24:03.210 --> 01:24:04.073
You'll be fine.

01:24:04.073 --> 01:24:05.178
- Okay.

01:24:08.319 --> 01:24:10.838
- Give it up for Andy Holiday.

01:24:15.257 --> 01:24:17.052
Up next we have Ali.

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:18.536
Take it away, Ali.

01:25:04.892 --> 01:25:05.893
- I'm sorry.

01:25:17.353 --> 01:25:18.285
- Hey.

01:25:18.285 --> 01:25:19.769
- Why did you make me do that?

01:25:19.769 --> 01:25:21.633
I wasn't ready, you
knew I wasn't ready.

01:25:21.633 --> 01:25:22.565
- I didn't make you do anything,

01:25:22.565 --> 01:25:23.877
and I'm glad you went up there,

01:25:23.877 --> 01:25:25.327
even if it was
just for a second.

01:25:25.327 --> 01:25:28.951
- You don't even know
what you're talking about.

01:25:30.159 --> 01:25:33.197
Everybody says it's in my blood.

01:25:33.197 --> 01:25:34.508
- What?

01:25:34.508 --> 01:25:37.649
- Everybody says
it's in my blood.

01:25:37.649 --> 01:25:38.995
But you know what
else is in my blood?

01:25:38.995 --> 01:25:41.377
Fucking crazy is in my blood.

01:25:42.861 --> 01:25:46.244
You know, it's just like I'm
a fucking ticking time bomb.

01:25:46.244 --> 01:25:47.763
Everybody sees it
when they look at me,

01:25:47.763 --> 01:25:51.939
it's like it's in my veins,
and they just know it.

01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:58.014
I used to watch him do
this shit all the time.

01:25:59.499 --> 01:26:01.052
I would sit in the
back of those clubs,

01:26:01.052 --> 01:26:04.883
and I would watch him, night
after night, just exhausted.

01:26:07.127 --> 01:26:09.025
And tormented and sick.

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:12.891
Sick of his own act.

01:26:14.341 --> 01:26:18.518
To the point where he hated it,
and everyone and everything.

01:26:26.042 --> 01:26:28.390
And the second I open
my mouth on that stage,

01:26:28.390 --> 01:26:30.875
I can't take it back.

01:26:30.875 --> 01:26:34.292
'Cause they'll cut me down the
same way they cut him down,

01:26:34.292 --> 01:26:36.191
and then I'll go crazy,

01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:37.813
and I'll lock myself
in the bathroom,

01:26:37.813 --> 01:26:41.196
and I'll shoot myself
up and I'll die.

01:26:41.196 --> 01:26:43.991
And everybody will talk
about how fuckin' funny I was

01:26:43.991 --> 01:26:45.890
and what a hero I was
and I was the best

01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:48.893
and then they'll
forget about me.

01:26:48.893 --> 01:26:51.723
Same way they
forgot about my dad.

01:26:56.418 --> 01:26:57.729
- I don't understand
why you're determined

01:26:57.729 --> 01:27:00.456
to assign yourself
the same fate.

01:27:08.188 --> 01:27:11.053
- Was that really your sister?

01:27:11.053 --> 01:27:12.227
- What?

01:27:13.607 --> 01:27:17.301
- Who you had lunch with,
was that your sister?

01:27:17.301 --> 01:27:20.062
- You followin' me around now?

01:27:20.062 --> 01:27:23.099
- Just answer
the question, Sean.

01:27:23.099 --> 01:27:25.412
- Of course she's my sister.

01:27:27.103 --> 01:27:27.966
- What's her name?

01:27:27.966 --> 01:27:29.244
- Emily.

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:33.593
- How come I don't know her.

01:27:35.698 --> 01:27:37.769
And why is there still nothing
in your fucking apartment?

01:27:37.769 --> 01:27:39.633
I mean, is this just
a temporary thing?

01:27:39.633 --> 01:27:41.394
Are you leaving soon?

01:27:43.568 --> 01:27:45.432
- You know what,
you do sound crazy.

01:27:45.432 --> 01:27:47.814
- Oh, thank you
for your honestly.

01:27:47.814 --> 01:27:49.264
- She's in rehab.

01:27:51.196 --> 01:27:53.302
My sister's in rehab.

01:27:53.302 --> 01:27:56.926
But given your sensitivity
on this subject of addiction,

01:27:56.926 --> 01:27:58.928
I didn't think it was a
good time to tell you,

01:27:58.928 --> 01:28:02.311
and honestly, I wasn't
ready to tell you.

01:28:02.311 --> 01:28:03.692
And there's nothing
in my apartment

01:28:03.692 --> 01:28:06.936
because it was her
apartment that I moved into

01:28:06.936 --> 01:28:09.836
shortly before her
life fell apart.

01:28:12.321 --> 01:28:15.290
And I had to help her
sell all her stuff,

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:19.121
so that she could pay
for her treatment,

01:28:19.121 --> 01:28:20.433
and I know it's shocking for you

01:28:20.433 --> 01:28:22.814
that someone could have
some pain in their life

01:28:22.814 --> 01:28:25.990
other than you, but
that's what it is.

01:28:33.238 --> 01:28:37.381
Why are you so desperate to
find a reason not to trust me?

01:28:40.453 --> 01:28:43.179
- 'Cause I don't
fucking know you.

01:28:43.179 --> 01:28:44.491
You've been her for
what, six weeks?

01:28:44.491 --> 01:28:46.597
I'm just, you
can't fix me, okay?

01:28:46.597 --> 01:28:50.463
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry
about your sister, I am,

01:28:50.463 --> 01:28:53.017
but you can't help me, too.

01:28:53.017 --> 01:28:54.225
You know, I just don't,

01:28:54.225 --> 01:28:55.882
I don't think that this
is such a good idea.

01:28:55.882 --> 01:28:57.849
- Yeah, well I don't like
yelling in parking lots either.

01:28:57.849 --> 01:28:59.299
- No, this, us.

01:28:59.299 --> 01:29:03.061
I don't that this, I don't
think that this is a good idea.

01:29:16.834 --> 01:29:19.008
- Do you really mean that?

01:29:27.914 --> 01:29:30.468
I'm sorry about your father

01:29:30.468 --> 01:29:32.470
and I don't pretend to
know what that's like,

01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:35.197
but it really doesn't
give you license

01:29:35.197 --> 01:29:38.269
to treat the people
who care about you

01:29:38.269 --> 01:29:40.202
like they don't matter.

01:29:42.515 --> 01:29:45.034
- I'm sorry you feel that way.

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:57.461
- I hope you get over this
fear you have of being seen.

01:29:57.461 --> 01:30:01.637
And I hope you get up there
and you give it your best shot,

01:30:03.536 --> 01:30:05.607
and I hope you're
incredibly successful,

01:30:05.607 --> 01:30:08.713
and you get everything
that you want.

01:30:11.026 --> 01:30:15.237
And I hope that when
you get it, it's enough.

01:30:15.237 --> 01:30:18.792
Because when you do,
you're gonna be alone.

01:30:29.389 --> 01:30:31.874
It was nice knowing you, Alma.

01:31:36.076 --> 01:31:36.905
- Hello?

01:31:41.772 --> 01:31:42.600
Joan?

01:31:45.603 --> 01:31:46.466
Hello?

01:31:51.091 --> 01:31:52.092
Hello, Joan?

01:31:58.754 --> 01:31:59.583
Joan!

01:32:08.212 --> 01:32:09.040
Hey.

01:32:10.317 --> 01:32:12.872
- I've been trying to call you.

01:32:16.047 --> 01:32:18.463
- Where's all your stuff?

01:32:18.463 --> 01:32:19.879
- My daughter's place is ready.

01:32:19.879 --> 01:32:21.915
I really don't wanna
hang around here

01:32:21.915 --> 01:32:23.538
any longer than I have to.

01:32:23.538 --> 01:32:24.884
- Your daughter?

01:32:26.264 --> 01:32:27.680
- Yeah, she lives in Florida,

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:30.890
and I'm going to
go live with her.

01:32:30.890 --> 01:32:31.718
- Florida?

01:32:33.513 --> 01:32:36.551
But no, no, no you
can't move to Florida.

01:32:36.551 --> 01:32:39.381
No nothing about
you is Floridian.

01:32:40.485 --> 01:32:44.662
- I'll
learn to enjoy pastels.

01:32:44.662 --> 01:32:47.562
- But see, you just
hired someone else

01:32:47.562 --> 01:32:50.323
to come take all
your stuff away.

01:32:51.738 --> 01:32:53.740
- I left messages saying
I needed to leave sooner.

01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:55.431
- No, no you know I wasn't.

01:32:55.431 --> 01:32:58.849
I wasn't done yet, I just
needed a little more time,

01:32:58.849 --> 01:33:00.333
and I would have finished,

01:33:00.333 --> 01:33:02.887
but you just decided
that I'm done.

01:33:02.887 --> 01:33:05.338
That's really
fucked up, you know?

01:33:05.338 --> 01:33:07.789
I really needed
this, and you just,

01:33:07.789 --> 01:33:11.551
you can't just throw
away a person like that.

01:33:11.551 --> 01:33:12.794
- I can give you the
rest of the money.

01:33:12.794 --> 01:33:16.970
- I don't want it, keep
it!

01:33:24.391 --> 01:33:26.152
I wasn't ready.

01:33:26.152 --> 01:33:27.671
- Okay, okay.

01:33:27.671 --> 01:33:29.293
Take a deep breath.

01:33:31.778 --> 01:33:32.952
Take a breath.

01:33:34.885 --> 01:33:36.334
- I wasn't ready.

01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:44.273
- I miss this.

01:33:45.412 --> 01:33:48.346
Nobody makes fires
in the summer.

01:33:48.346 --> 01:33:50.728
- It's too hot.

01:33:50.728 --> 01:33:52.488
- You feeling better?

01:33:54.387 --> 01:33:55.457
- This helps.

01:34:00.807 --> 01:34:02.706
- Do you want him back?

01:34:06.399 --> 01:34:08.781
- I don't think he'd have me.

01:34:10.368 --> 01:34:11.887
- Mm.

01:34:11.887 --> 01:34:16.064
When my husband left me, I
stayed in bed for a month.

01:34:17.859 --> 01:34:19.654
- What made you get out?

01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:20.516
- Surgery.

01:34:26.453 --> 01:34:28.455
- Do you hate him?

01:34:29.318 --> 01:34:30.319
- Some days.

01:34:31.942 --> 01:34:36.118
But if I'm being honest,
oh I did a lot of pushing.

01:34:41.676 --> 01:34:44.264
- At least you
have your daughter.

01:34:44.264 --> 01:34:47.992
- Hm, well that
is a work in progress.

01:34:55.724 --> 01:34:57.830
- Is it true you're
writing new book?

01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:59.901
- The internet says

01:34:59.901 --> 01:35:03.007
I've been writing a
book for 10 years.

01:35:04.699 --> 01:35:07.598
Do you know the
hedgehog's dilemma?

01:35:09.393 --> 01:35:12.707
In the wild, hedgehogs
will roll toward each other

01:35:12.707 --> 01:35:15.882
and try to bundle
together for warmth,

01:35:17.159 --> 01:35:20.784
but their spines
stab into each other,

01:35:20.784 --> 01:35:23.027
and they roll apart
because of the pain,

01:35:23.027 --> 01:35:24.408
but then they
realize they're cold,

01:35:24.408 --> 01:35:26.686
so they try again and again

01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:31.415
to find the exact
distance for warmth

01:35:31.415 --> 01:35:33.175
without getting hurt.

01:35:34.798 --> 01:35:36.938
- Self-preservation.

01:35:36.938 --> 01:35:38.180
- Mm.

01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:41.045
I spent most of my life
in a solid seven years

01:35:41.045 --> 01:35:42.875
studying other people,

01:35:44.048 --> 01:35:46.879
and then another three
writing about them,

01:35:46.879 --> 01:35:48.363
but I never looked at the ones

01:35:48.363 --> 01:35:51.607
that were right in front of me

01:35:51.607 --> 01:35:54.438
because I didn't
know how to feel.

01:35:57.130 --> 01:35:59.857
I didn't know how
to let them in.

01:36:10.350 --> 01:36:14.527
- You know, you asked me
the other day why I'm angry.

01:36:15.908 --> 01:36:19.532
The other day you asked,
and I don't have an answer.

01:36:21.948 --> 01:36:23.881
I'm angry all the time.

01:36:25.849 --> 01:36:27.851
I've been angry forever.

01:36:36.342 --> 01:36:38.965
Yeah, I told you my dad died,

01:36:38.965 --> 01:36:41.140
but I didn't tell you how.

01:36:49.424 --> 01:36:52.599
He died on our
upstairs bathroom floor

01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:56.845
because he shoved a needle
full of smack too big

01:36:56.845 --> 01:37:00.642
into his arm, and it
caused his heart to stop.

01:37:03.093 --> 01:37:04.163
And I was 10.

01:37:15.001 --> 01:37:17.176
You know, I like to think,

01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:22.215
I like to think he
really did wanna stay.

01:37:25.149 --> 01:37:26.979
He just hurt too much.

01:37:28.704 --> 01:37:31.811
He'd done too much
damage to himself.

01:37:42.718 --> 01:37:46.722
A few years later, my mom
and I moved back here.

01:37:48.172 --> 01:37:51.796
And there was this boy down
the street, and I loved him,

01:37:51.796 --> 01:37:54.627
I loved him right
away, instantly.

01:37:59.459 --> 01:38:02.117
I loved him so
much, and one day,

01:38:04.154 --> 01:38:06.225
he heard me fighting with my mom

01:38:06.225 --> 01:38:09.228
because I always
fought with my mom,

01:38:10.436 --> 01:38:12.887
and he asked me to come over,

01:38:15.096 --> 01:38:18.996
and he gave me a drink,
and I thought this was,

01:38:22.206 --> 01:38:26.383
I was like 13, so I thought
this was really badass,

01:38:28.488 --> 01:38:31.491
so I had a drink,
and I had another,

01:38:34.978 --> 01:38:39.154
and had another and another,
until I couldn't see straight.

01:38:46.575 --> 01:38:49.233
I still loved this boy,

01:38:49.233 --> 01:38:53.410
so I told him I love him,
and I tried to kiss him,

01:38:59.312 --> 01:39:03.178
and he pushed me
away, and he said no,

01:39:03.178 --> 01:39:05.077
you're gonna regret it.

01:39:07.389 --> 01:39:11.393
And I said no, no, I
won't, this is what I want.

01:39:17.330 --> 01:39:21.507
And the next morning, when I
stopped puking my guts out,

01:39:27.375 --> 01:39:30.688
he said we could use
each other for practice

01:39:30.688 --> 01:39:33.346
for when we really love someone.

01:39:40.871 --> 01:39:42.942
That's what I was to him.

01:39:45.462 --> 01:39:46.704
I was practice.

01:39:59.890 --> 01:40:03.135
I let him have sex with me
so he could get good at it

01:40:03.135 --> 01:40:04.722
for someone else

01:40:04.722 --> 01:40:08.002
because I was drunk
and my dad was dead

01:40:10.866 --> 01:40:13.352
and my mother was a million
miles away in her own world

01:40:13.352 --> 01:40:17.528
and I needed to convince
myself that someone loved me.

01:40:26.917 --> 01:40:28.022
I'm a cliche.

01:40:32.474 --> 01:40:34.269
- So many people
spend so much time

01:40:34.269 --> 01:40:36.616
trying to recreate the past,

01:40:37.755 --> 01:40:40.517
so they can rewrite
their histories

01:40:40.517 --> 01:40:44.693
and come out the victor, the
one that doesn't get hurt.

01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:49.112
You can't do it.

01:40:53.047 --> 01:40:56.740
And you didn't deserve
what happened to you.

01:40:58.155 --> 01:41:00.019
You need to know that.

01:41:19.073 --> 01:41:21.696
- I think it's time for a taxi.

01:41:23.767 --> 01:41:26.183
Um, I'll get my car tomorrow.

01:41:39.196 --> 01:41:40.646
- Good luck, Ali.

01:41:41.578 --> 01:41:43.027
- You, too.

01:42:15.336 --> 01:42:16.371
- Hey there.

01:42:16.371 --> 01:42:17.269
- Hey, Ali.

01:42:18.166 --> 01:42:19.857
- Do you wanna get outta here?

01:42:19.857 --> 01:42:21.514
- Ali, this is Karen.

01:42:21.514 --> 01:42:22.860
- Hi.

01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:25.449
- So you're a little busy?

01:42:25.449 --> 01:42:26.692
- Yeah, we are.

01:42:26.692 --> 01:42:27.900
- Oh, I'm sorry, was
I talking to you?

01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:30.799
- I'll text you
another time, okay?

01:42:31.731 --> 01:42:32.560
Ali.

01:42:37.944 --> 01:42:41.914
â™ª Left me for dead
that's what they said

01:42:41.914 --> 01:42:43.674
â™ª That's what they said

01:42:43.674 --> 01:42:47.230
â™ª Now I am back in my head

01:42:50.267 --> 01:42:52.959
â™ª It's not lost

01:42:56.929 --> 01:42:59.518
â™ª I'm not lost

01:43:04.178 --> 01:43:06.835
â™ª It's not lost

01:43:10.253 --> 01:43:12.876
â™ª I'm not lost

01:43:22.368 --> 01:43:23.197
- Thanks.

01:45:44.959 --> 01:45:45.787
Hey.

01:45:47.306 --> 01:45:48.238
- Nice eye.

01:45:49.170 --> 01:45:50.723
- Earned it myself.

01:45:52.346 --> 01:45:53.588
- You'll have to forgive me,

01:45:53.588 --> 01:45:56.729
I'm a little tired
from fucking myself.

01:45:56.729 --> 01:45:58.179
- I deserve that.

01:46:01.596 --> 01:46:03.598
- What do you want, Ali?

01:46:05.013 --> 01:46:07.775
- I did the last
two assignments.

01:46:19.925 --> 01:46:20.753
- Better.

01:46:24.723 --> 01:46:26.621
- You knew, didn't you?

01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:30.936
- If you're implying that's
why you felt I was hard on you,

01:46:30.936 --> 01:46:32.938
I'm sorry to disappoint.

01:46:35.009 --> 01:46:36.769
I don't know you, Ali.

01:46:36.769 --> 01:46:40.463
It'd be easy to assume
I do, but I don't.

01:46:40.463 --> 01:46:42.188
I only know you have talent,

01:46:42.188 --> 01:46:44.432
but you think you can coast,

01:46:44.432 --> 01:46:48.436
and that is a very short
trip that ends nowhere.

01:46:51.405 --> 01:46:53.648
- I wanna come back.

01:46:53.648 --> 01:46:54.477
- Why?

01:46:55.650 --> 01:46:56.858
- What?

01:46:56.858 --> 01:46:58.446
- Why do you wanna come back?

01:46:58.446 --> 01:47:00.344
Don't do it out of some
false sense of obligation

01:47:00.344 --> 01:47:03.244
that you really need to
finish what you start.

01:47:03.244 --> 01:47:04.970
- So you're saying
I should just quit?

01:47:04.970 --> 01:47:06.281
- Yeah.

01:47:06.281 --> 01:47:07.317
Quit.

01:47:07.317 --> 01:47:08.525
Do it, give up.

01:47:10.458 --> 01:47:13.288
Find something
else, and do that.

01:47:13.288 --> 01:47:15.946
- Okay, well what
if I don't want to.

01:47:15.946 --> 01:47:17.120
- Well, if that's the case,

01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:20.330
if quitting just
doesn't work for you,

01:47:20.330 --> 01:47:23.022
I mean really giving
up is not an option,

01:47:23.022 --> 01:47:25.197
then you'll figure it out.

01:47:27.441 --> 01:47:29.512
You know the final's mandatory.

01:47:29.512 --> 01:47:30.374
- Mm-hm.

01:47:32.411 --> 01:47:35.138
- Then I'll see you Monday.

01:47:35.138 --> 01:47:38.797
Oh, and Ali, prepare to
make that apology public

01:47:38.797 --> 01:47:40.454
next time I see you.

01:48:13.590 --> 01:48:14.453
- Sean?

01:48:17.214 --> 01:48:18.422
Sean, I know you're in there.

01:48:18.422 --> 01:48:19.631
I can hear you.

01:48:32.229 --> 01:48:34.128
Sean, I'm really sorry.

01:48:38.926 --> 01:48:42.170
Okay, guess I'm gonna
talk to the door.

01:48:44.656 --> 01:48:48.245
Hello, door, we've
met several times,

01:48:48.245 --> 01:48:50.834
so I trust you with my message.

01:48:53.043 --> 01:48:57.220
But it's very important, so
make sure you're listening.

01:48:58.393 --> 01:49:01.535
Could you please tell
Sean that I'm sorry?

01:49:05.193 --> 01:49:07.748
I'm sorry for being an asshole.

01:49:11.027 --> 01:49:14.513
I know he was just
trying to help me,

01:49:14.513 --> 01:49:18.068
but right now I'm just
trying to figure out

01:49:18.068 --> 01:49:19.311
how to help me.

01:49:25.317 --> 01:49:29.493
And could you tell him that
I really, really like him?

01:49:33.083 --> 01:49:34.913
And I wanna try again.

01:49:38.882 --> 01:49:40.332
And I understand if
he doesn't want to,

01:49:40.332 --> 01:49:42.092
I know it's my fault.

01:49:44.025 --> 01:49:44.854
But um.

01:49:47.339 --> 01:49:48.823
I'm working on it.

01:49:52.586 --> 01:49:55.519
And could you please tell him

01:49:55.519 --> 01:49:57.556
that I'm going back to class,

01:49:57.556 --> 01:50:00.973
and my final is at
Laughs in three weeks,

01:50:02.665 --> 01:50:05.668
and I'd really like
if he was there.

01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:11.708
Okay.

01:50:16.092 --> 01:50:16.920
Good talk.

01:50:34.869 --> 01:50:39.046
â™ª All of my heroes
sit up straight

01:50:43.464 --> 01:50:47.641
â™ª They stare at the
ground they radiate

01:50:51.748 --> 01:50:54.406
â™ª Me I'm mumblin'
through the kitchen

01:50:54.406 --> 01:50:57.720
â™ª For the sun to pay up

01:51:01.171 --> 01:51:05.348
â™ª Lonely is the ring
on a cold coffee cup

01:51:08.351 --> 01:51:11.837
â™ª And I'm some sick hound

01:51:12.838 --> 01:51:15.841
â™ª Diggin' for bones

01:51:17.049 --> 01:51:18.775
â™ª If it weren't
for second chances

01:51:18.775 --> 01:51:21.778
â™ª We'd all be alone

01:51:29.199 --> 01:51:33.376
â™ª My hands they were
strangers lost in the night

01:51:38.001 --> 01:51:42.178
â™ª All the wavin' around
that parking lot light

01:51:46.665 --> 01:51:48.840
â™ª And I'm waitin' in the wings

01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:52.360
â™ª While the trees undress

01:51:55.916 --> 01:52:00.092
â™ª Cuppin' my ear to
hear the wind confess

01:52:03.268 --> 01:52:06.823
â™ª I'm a ghost in the garden

01:52:06.823 --> 01:52:09.826
â™ª Scarin' the crows

01:52:11.759 --> 01:52:13.416
â™ª If it weren't
for second chances

01:52:13.416 --> 01:52:16.419
â™ª We'd all be alone

01:52:24.254 --> 01:52:26.360
â™ª And I'm runnin' from nothin'

01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:29.156
â™ª No thoughts in my mind

01:52:29.156 --> 01:52:30.640
â™ª And my heart was all blacked

01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:33.470
â™ª And I saw something shine

01:52:33.470 --> 01:52:35.162
â™ª But that part was yours

01:52:35.162 --> 01:52:37.751
â™ª But it might just be mine

01:52:37.751 --> 01:52:41.893
â™ª I can share with you
if you give me time

01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:47.588
â™ª And I'm all blood and knuckles

01:52:47.588 --> 01:52:51.143
â™ª Longing for home

01:52:51.143 --> 01:52:53.145
â™ª If it weren't
for second chances

01:52:53.145 --> 01:52:56.148
â™ª We'd all be alone

01:53:38.881 --> 01:53:42.746
â™ª I'm a shot through the dark

01:53:43.575 --> 01:53:47.510
â™ª I'm a black sinkhole

01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:49.719
â™ª If it weren't
for second chances

01:53:49.719 --> 01:53:52.722
â™ª We'd all be alone

01:54:25.306 --> 01:54:28.102
â™ª Look at the garden

01:54:28.102 --> 01:54:30.967
â™ª We've sown

01:54:30.967 --> 01:54:33.970
â™ª Sweat in the soil

01:54:35.247 --> 01:54:37.353
â™ª It's ready to grow

01:54:37.353 --> 01:54:40.701
â™ª But winter's here now

01:54:42.392 --> 01:54:46.120
â™ª And it's time for me to go

01:54:49.296 --> 01:54:51.850
â™ª Things will get harder

01:54:51.850 --> 01:54:54.266
â™ª But spring's around the corner

01:54:55.305 --> 01:55:01.311
