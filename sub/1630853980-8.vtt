WEBVTT

00:46.421 --> 00:48.090
I can't let him go in alone.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.884
It's too late.
By now, he's already there.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.054
Then we follow.
Kofun, Wren and I can catch up to him.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.974
Even if he does kill Sibeth,
how does he think he's gonna get out?

00:58.809 --> 01:00.644
He doesn't think he'll get out.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.942
-We have to go.
-Yes.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.360
No.

01:08.443 --> 01:11.822
We have the entire population
of Pennsa inside this tunnel,

01:12.739 --> 01:15.367
and we are nowhere near its end yet.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.871
If she starts
hurling her God Thunder again,

01:18.954 --> 01:21.582
this place may very well
become a mass grave.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.669
There was a time to fight,
and that time has passed.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.380
But my father is fighting.

01:29.298 --> 01:33.135
Well, let's hope he's doing it
very quietly then.

01:34.595 --> 01:35.804
You want one?

01:35.888 --> 01:37.806
No, thank you.

01:38.515 --> 01:39.808
More for me.

02:01.205 --> 02:04.416
So, do we have an actual plan?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.419
Find the queen and kill her.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.508
That's more of a goal than a plan.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.055
You're gonna frighten people with that.

03:43.682 --> 03:46.602
People are already frightened of me.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.146
Yes, I suppose they are.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.940
-But not you.
-Well, don't take it personally.

03:52.024 --> 03:54.985
I just don't fear people
the way others do.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.030
Why is that?

03:59.489 --> 04:01.325
You're not a particularly large man.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.995
No. In fact, I was the runt of the litter.

04:06.121 --> 04:08.040
But I was smarter than everyone else.

04:08.540 --> 04:11.126
Smart enough to know
there were other paths to power.

04:12.836 --> 04:16.005
Edo Voss was a giant of a man,

04:16.089 --> 04:18.759
but because of that, he thought too small.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.263
He wanted to use the sighted
to guide his armies.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.557
He didn't even think about the fact

04:25.641 --> 04:28.185
that they could read the books
of our ancestors.

04:28.268 --> 04:32.231
Unlock knowledge
that could change the face of warfare.

04:35.108 --> 04:38.695
I spent my entire life searching
for a power

04:38.779 --> 04:42.533
that didn't come from how hard
you could swing your sword.

04:44.159 --> 04:48.330
And now here I am,
sitting across from you.

04:49.498 --> 04:53.168
Able to destroy entire cities
without an army.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.964
That's something Edo
never even dreamed of.

04:59.675 --> 05:01.552
Which reminds me.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.514
It seems to me we should have heard
from Maghra by now.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.810
At what point do we assume
that she's made other plans?

05:10.477 --> 05:12.729
Maghra decides nothing quickly.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.941
No doubt her family is trying
to convince her to fight.

05:16.024 --> 05:19.611
But her twisted sense
of virtue will not be able to resist

05:19.695 --> 05:23.740
the idea of sacrificing her own life
for her people.

05:24.741 --> 05:25.951
If you say so.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.454
Tormada.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.206
Yes.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.543
Have your bombs ready, just in case.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.920
They always are, my queen.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.050
It should be me facing her, not him.

05:42.551 --> 05:44.511
Your sacrifice would earn us nothing

05:45.012 --> 05:46.889
and leave your people without a queen.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.016
So, I must surrender my husband?

05:49.600 --> 05:52.227
If that's what comes with it. Yes.

05:52.311 --> 05:53.312
No.

05:55.314 --> 05:58.942
Maghra. Stay the course. Stay the course.

06:00.444 --> 06:02.654
This moment right here

06:04.031 --> 06:07.117
may very well be
the moment for which you were born.

06:31.850 --> 06:36.522
Let the river run

06:37.439 --> 06:41.068
Let all the dreamers

06:41.151 --> 06:44.154
Wake the nation

06:45.113 --> 06:46.949
Come

06:47.032 --> 06:52.955
The New Jerusalem

06:54.122 --> 06:59.294
Silver cities rise

06:59.878 --> 07:03.215
The morning lights

07:03.298 --> 07:06.969
The streets that lead them

07:07.678 --> 07:12.683
And sirens call them on

07:13.433 --> 07:16.436
With a song

07:18.146 --> 07:21.233
It's asking

07:21.316 --> 07:25.362
For the taking

07:25.445 --> 07:31.285
Trembling, shaking

07:32.202 --> 07:34.288
Oh

07:34.371 --> 07:38.917
My heart is aching

07:39.001 --> 07:40.794
We're coming to the edge

07:40.878 --> 07:42.713
Running on the water

07:42.796 --> 07:44.131
Coming through the fog

07:44.214 --> 07:46.216
Sons and daughters

07:46.300 --> 07:50.721
Let the river run

07:52.097 --> 07:56.143
Let all the dreamers

07:56.226 --> 07:59.730
Wake the nation

08:00.522 --> 08:01.648
Come

08:02.941 --> 08:09.198
The New Jerusalem

08:19.833 --> 08:21.668
This is her tent. I can smell her.

08:23.587 --> 08:24.755
Then where is she?

08:26.298 --> 08:28.133
-My queen.
-You called for me.

08:28.217 --> 08:30.052
Ayura, tell her what you hear.

08:31.470 --> 08:32.804
Nothing.

08:33.847 --> 08:34.890
Nothing?

08:35.390 --> 08:38.184
No voices. No tools.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.730
No sizzle of pans or fires in the pits.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.149
No babies crying.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.944
Just the muffled sounds of many feet.

08:47.486 --> 08:48.654
Muffled?

08:49.238 --> 08:50.405
Muffled by earth.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.366
They're underground.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.034
Hiding.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.327
No. They're walking.

08:55.410 --> 08:56.578
A tunnel.

08:57.079 --> 08:58.372
They found a way out.

08:59.456 --> 09:00.541
You have them ready?

09:00.624 --> 09:02.334
I do, my queen.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.418
Bomb them.

09:04.837 --> 09:07.589
-Kill them!
-Fire!

09:11.885 --> 09:13.303
Fire!

09:27.734 --> 09:28.986
Oh, no.

09:29.945 --> 09:31.154
Fuck.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.239
Come.

09:45.127 --> 09:47.254
-She knows.
-Yes.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.630
Keep moving!

09:52.509 --> 09:54.595
I said keep moving!

10:00.350 --> 10:01.685
Anything?

10:02.394 --> 10:03.395
No.

10:04.146 --> 10:05.189
Don't stop.

10:08.442 --> 10:09.860
Fire!

10:12.404 --> 10:15.574
Ten-degree turns! Same distance!

10:17.075 --> 10:18.452
Call it out!

10:19.536 --> 10:21.288
-Ready!
-Ready!

10:21.997 --> 10:23.123
Fire!

10:36.094 --> 10:37.387
Stop!

10:43.227 --> 10:44.645
-Kofun?
-Wait here.

11:14.258 --> 11:15.300
Kofun.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.469
We have stopped them.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.388
Excellent.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.014
Hit them again.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.609
Kofun?

11:33.569 --> 11:34.903
Yeah?

11:36.488 --> 11:39.157
Run! Run!

11:45.038 --> 11:46.373
Kofun!

11:53.714 --> 11:54.965
Kofun!

12:07.436 --> 12:09.229
You think anybody heard that, Baba?

12:12.107 --> 12:14.234
-Who's there?
-Captain?

12:14.860 --> 12:15.944
They're between us!

12:16.028 --> 12:17.404
-New plan?
-New plan.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.239
Fight!

12:20.199 --> 12:21.325
Kofun!

12:26.830 --> 12:27.831
Kofun!

12:31.043 --> 12:32.252
Kofun.

12:36.757 --> 12:37.799
You all right?

12:38.592 --> 12:39.843
I'm okay. Nothing's broke.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.303
-Are you sure?
-Is Wolffe okay?

12:41.386 --> 12:42.387
Yes.

12:45.474 --> 12:46.725
We can't go any further.

12:47.392 --> 12:50.771
We can't stay here.
We'll be buried alive.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.607
Her bombs are still falling up there.

12:59.196 --> 13:02.616
If it's come down
to choosing our manner of death,

13:04.034 --> 13:07.788
I'd rather die fighting for our land
than hiding beneath it.

13:08.914 --> 13:09.957
I agree.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.210
I agree.

13:14.628 --> 13:15.629
Me too.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.511
-General.
-What is it?

13:23.595 --> 13:26.431
-Fighting. Within the camp.
-Witchfinders?

13:26.515 --> 13:29.518
Not Witchfinders and not Trivantians.

13:30.018 --> 13:33.605
Two men. One of them is very large.

13:34.439 --> 13:35.524
Baba Voss.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.150
They've infiltrated the camp.

13:37.943 --> 13:41.029
Sound the alarm! Intruders in the camp!

13:42.072 --> 13:46.827
Intruders in the camp!
Intruders in the camp!

13:50.330 --> 13:53.917
Intruders! Intruders in the camp!

13:59.256 --> 14:02.426
Well, fuck it.
It was bound to happen at some point.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.774
They have been through here. Let's go.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.581
Baba, you dead?

14:33.081 --> 14:34.208
No.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.710
-Me neither.
-Head for the bombs.

15:10.619 --> 15:12.120
Thanks, Maddox.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.047
You getting up?

16:05.549 --> 16:08.927
Give me a minute. He's a big fucker.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.171
Maghra.

16:45.297 --> 16:47.508
-Why would she come now?
-Stop the attack.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.093
She hasn't abided with your terms.

16:50.177 --> 16:53.096
My sister is as simple
as she is predictable.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.682
She failed to save her people.

16:55.766 --> 16:59.102
Now she will sacrifice herself
to save what's left of them.

16:59.186 --> 17:02.231
We should continue the attack.
They still have an army.

17:03.273 --> 17:06.859
And in a matter of moments,
it will be our army to command.

17:06.944 --> 17:08.862
-How can you trust that--
-Tormada.

17:09.404 --> 17:12.406
You've come inside me,
and you've bombed a city into submission.

17:12.491 --> 17:15.243
I'd say you're having a good day.
Don't ruin it.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.329
Halt!

17:22.251 --> 17:23.252
Lieutenant Moss!

17:23.335 --> 17:28.048
Every spare soldier should be searching
the camp for intruders!

17:28.131 --> 17:29.466
Yes, sir.

17:29.967 --> 17:31.385
You heard him. Fan out.

17:34.429 --> 17:35.681
Maghra.

17:39.893 --> 17:42.729
I'm so happy you decided
to accept my invitation.

17:43.522 --> 17:46.441
I'm just sorry that it's come to this.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.110
Are you?

17:50.195 --> 17:54.491
I know you think I'm wrong,
but, just like you,

17:55.492 --> 17:58.537
I'm only trying
to do what I feel is right.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.372
By killing innocent citizens?

18:00.956 --> 18:03.709
Don't you ever get tired
of your own self-righteousness?

18:04.293 --> 18:06.545
-I protected you.
-You betrayed me.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.714
That was to protect everyone else.

18:09.464 --> 18:13.468
And round and round we go.

18:14.303 --> 18:15.470
Sibeth.

18:22.394 --> 18:25.981
Let me remind you that you tried
to overthrow me when you were younger.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.566
And now you tried again.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.234
And in both cases,

18:29.318 --> 18:31.195
the dire consequences
of your insurrections

18:31.278 --> 18:32.988
seemed to somehow surprise you.

18:36.283 --> 18:39.369
I wonder what it will take for you
to understand that you are not,

18:40.537 --> 18:43.123
and never will be a queen.

18:43.207 --> 18:45.209
I never wanted to be queen.

18:45.834 --> 18:48.462
I don't think either
of us really believes that.

18:53.467 --> 18:56.345
It wasn't enough
for you to be the favorite child.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.432
You needed to have everything
that was mine.

19:00.516 --> 19:01.517
This isn't about us.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.602
-It's not?
-Sibeth.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.812
We can fix this.

19:06.313 --> 19:10.817
There is still a chance
for everyone to get what they want.

19:13.362 --> 19:15.030
I already have what I want.

19:16.782 --> 19:18.075
You won't kill me.

19:20.202 --> 19:23.747
You might hate me,
but I know you still love me.

19:30.796 --> 19:34.174
You never did suffer
from a lack of confidence.

19:36.051 --> 19:39.513
You're still the sister
I have loved my whole life.

19:42.057 --> 19:43.892
Who braided my hair.

19:45.143 --> 19:47.020
Who made puppets for me.

19:48.564 --> 19:51.525
Who brought me into her bed
when it thundered.

19:57.865 --> 19:59.449
My sister.

20:02.119 --> 20:05.247
Who sung me to sleep
the night Mother died.

20:06.915 --> 20:09.168
Never losing patience.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.880
Never once letting go of my hand.

20:22.514 --> 20:27.144
Star shining bright above you

20:29.688 --> 20:33.358
Night breezes seem to whisper

20:33.442 --> 20:35.652
I love you

20:37.321 --> 20:42.409
Birds singing in the sycamore tree

20:44.161 --> 20:48.832
Dream a little dream of me

21:25.661 --> 21:27.329
I still have to kill you.

21:29.748 --> 21:31.291
There's no other way.

21:33.919 --> 21:35.420
I know. I know.

23:23.195 --> 23:24.821
Is it done, my queen?

23:28.617 --> 23:31.245
I am not your queen!

23:33.830 --> 23:34.998
Kill her.

23:44.132 --> 23:45.175
-Maghra!
-Tamacti.

23:45.259 --> 23:46.552
Formation!

23:55.853 --> 23:57.813
-Tamacti.
-Right beside you.

24:01.108 --> 24:02.359
Ready! And!

24:02.568 --> 24:05.445
-Well, you wanted a fight.
-That I did.

24:06.113 --> 24:07.573
-Kofun!
-Here.

24:13.287 --> 24:14.705
Move!

24:21.545 --> 24:23.297
Resume the attack!

25:33.450 --> 25:37.120
Fire those bombs!
Flatten the fucking city!

25:37.704 --> 25:39.248
Tormada.

25:39.331 --> 25:41.708
-Tormada!
-Baba Voss!

25:44.711 --> 25:46.129
I was hoping I'd run into you.

25:55.264 --> 25:56.849
Dad!

26:05.107 --> 26:06.275
Stop them!

26:26.712 --> 26:29.965
Baba Voss! Are you still with us?

26:31.717 --> 26:34.720
-I won't make the same mistake twice.
-Tormada!

26:37.472 --> 26:40.684
No! No! No!

26:57.075 --> 26:59.119
Oh, God!

26:59.661 --> 27:01.205
Fuck!

28:17.948 --> 28:18.949
Papa!

28:23.078 --> 28:24.830
How are you hurt?

28:26.707 --> 28:28.166
I am fine.

28:29.209 --> 28:30.836
Do not follow me.

28:30.919 --> 28:33.839
-Where are you going?
-To end this.

28:33.922 --> 28:36.800
Papa, you cannot go.
You are too badly hurt.

28:36.884 --> 28:38.177
Do not follow me.

28:38.886 --> 28:40.220
I will stay with you.

28:40.304 --> 28:42.556
No. I need you to stay here.

28:43.265 --> 28:46.310
I need you to protect me
with your arrows like you always have.

28:53.483 --> 28:54.484
Haniwa.

28:56.028 --> 28:57.112
I love you.

28:57.613 --> 29:02.242
Look at me. I love you.

29:03.493 --> 29:05.871
Remember what I taught you.

29:51.250 --> 29:52.835
I am Baba Voss.

32:40.294 --> 32:41.461
Maghra.

32:45.674 --> 32:46.675
Baba.

32:49.887 --> 32:51.388
I see you.

33:01.481 --> 33:02.733
Dad!

33:03.609 --> 33:05.027
Papa.

34:17.391 --> 34:23.480
I walk now, every morning,
past the shops and the homes.

34:26.650 --> 34:28.735
I can hear the families inside…

34:29.862 --> 34:32.531
Talking. Sleeping.

34:33.114 --> 34:35.993
Laughing. Crying.

34:41.248 --> 34:42.416
When I listen to them,

34:42.498 --> 34:48.130
I feel like a mother who wakes up at night
to make sure her baby is still breathing.

34:51.675 --> 34:54.178
I know I'm not really outside
to hear them.

34:56.929 --> 34:59.516
It's you I am seeking.

35:00.559 --> 35:06.273
Some last echo of you still bouncing
between the mountains.

35:09.443 --> 35:12.404
You have left behind a vast emptiness

35:13.697 --> 35:17.034
that wakes me up every morning
and forces me outside.

35:20.370 --> 35:22.206
You never wanted any of this.

35:23.749 --> 35:24.958
I know that.

35:28.086 --> 35:31.256
And every day,
I think about what was taken from you.

35:31.340 --> 35:32.841
What I took from you…

35:34.259 --> 35:38.096
in the service of this crown
I'm not even sure I deserve.

35:43.143 --> 35:46.855
Your children feel your absence
every bit as much as I do.

35:50.901 --> 35:54.863
But their futures,
the ones you gave your life to ensure,

35:54.947 --> 35:58.116
stretch out before them
with infinite promise.

36:01.119 --> 36:03.497
Your daughter has followed
in her mother's footsteps

36:03.580 --> 36:05.541
and married a Trivantian.

36:06.458 --> 36:10.170
Two sighted women making their way
in this world.

36:12.714 --> 36:15.634
It won't be easy, and I fear for them.

36:17.678 --> 36:20.722
But I hear the love in their voices
when they speak.

36:21.765 --> 36:25.853
And it warms me to know our Haniwa
has found such a love.

36:29.147 --> 36:31.733
Kofun is coming into his own as a father.

36:34.444 --> 36:38.073
And I know having a son means
not a day will go by

36:38.156 --> 36:40.242
that he doesn't think of his own father.

36:46.874 --> 36:50.711
I find myself drawn
to this terrible place…

36:52.921 --> 36:58.343
whose charred soil holds the remains
of both my sister and my husband.

37:00.179 --> 37:04.933
And I wonder how anything
will ever grow again in this burned,

37:05.017 --> 37:06.018
ruined earth.

37:13.817 --> 37:16.445
I don't know where we go when we die.

37:18.113 --> 37:19.615
But wherever you are,

37:20.616 --> 37:22.201
I hope you have finally found

37:22.284 --> 37:26.455
the peace you tried so hard
to find in life.

37:28.373 --> 37:31.460
For you and for all of us.

37:32.753 --> 37:34.838
And I hope you can forgive me.

38:01.740 --> 38:03.867
No one is denying the debt we owe Paya

38:03.951 --> 38:06.954
for defeating Tormada
and destroying his weapons.

38:07.579 --> 38:11.208
I myself barely escaped his attack
on our own government.

38:12.209 --> 38:15.587
However, we cannot sign this,
or any treaty,

38:15.671 --> 38:19.049
with a nation that will allow sanctuary
to the sighted.

38:19.675 --> 38:23.345
We've all just borne witness
to the destructive power of vision.

38:24.179 --> 38:26.515
It is the position
of the Trivantian people

38:27.099 --> 38:31.645
that vision simply poses too much
of a risk to all of us.

38:31.728 --> 38:33.939
I understand your position.

38:34.648 --> 38:37.860
But it was not vision
that built Tormada's bombs,

38:37.943 --> 38:41.405
but Tormada's cruel exploitation
of sighted children

38:41.488 --> 38:43.657
that accessed the knowledge
of the ancients.

38:44.241 --> 38:48.120
And it is that destructive knowledge,
not vision itself,

38:48.662 --> 38:50.372
that needs to be outlawed.

38:51.248 --> 38:56.211
The sighted will always be the gateway
to this knowledge.

38:56.295 --> 38:58.922
And there will always
be people like Tormada

38:59.006 --> 39:00.966
who would choose to exploit them.

39:01.633 --> 39:04.553
We stand with three sighted people,

39:05.179 --> 39:08.765
all of whom have played a significant role
in defeating Tormada

39:08.849 --> 39:11.143
-and destroying his bombs.
-Yes.

39:11.226 --> 39:14.271
And as we said earlier,
we will grant them amnesty.

39:14.354 --> 39:16.064
Why should we need amnesty?

39:16.899 --> 39:18.400
We haven't done anything wrong.

39:19.109 --> 39:21.028
In fact, if it weren't for us,

39:21.111 --> 39:23.655
then Tormada and his bombs
would be destroying your city right now.

39:23.739 --> 39:26.074
Haniwa, now is not the time.

39:26.158 --> 39:28.619
-No? When is the right time?
-Princess!

39:28.702 --> 39:30.996
I fear you have forgotten
who you're talking to.

39:31.079 --> 39:32.623
I think it is you who has forgotten.

39:32.706 --> 39:34.291
Ambassador, I apologize--

39:34.791 --> 39:39.004
Vision is not coming back!
It's already here.

39:39.838 --> 39:40.839
And if I were you,

39:40.923 --> 39:43.008
I'd be grateful
that we are offering you peace,

39:43.091 --> 39:45.802
because trust me,
you do not want us as an enemy.

39:48.305 --> 39:51.183
-Was that a threat?
-Of course not--

39:51.266 --> 39:54.061
Ambassador, I apologize.
You must understand,

39:54.144 --> 39:57.523
my sister and I have been hunted
our entire lives

39:58.482 --> 40:00.484
simply because of how we were born.

40:01.527 --> 40:05.113
The idea that I
or anyone like me would be a threat

40:05.197 --> 40:08.367
to the unsighted is based simply
on superstition and fear,

40:08.450 --> 40:10.452
and not the reality of who I am.

40:10.994 --> 40:15.415
Because who I am has nothing to do
with the fact that I can see.

40:18.293 --> 40:19.545
I'm a son.

40:20.462 --> 40:21.713
I'm a father.

40:22.506 --> 40:23.799
I'm a Payan.

40:26.176 --> 40:29.471
But most importantly,
I'm your partner in peace.

40:31.723 --> 40:35.602
So, please. May we continue?

40:44.152 --> 40:45.153
Very well.

40:52.661 --> 40:53.662
Haniwa.

40:53.745 --> 40:55.163
Tak.

40:55.247 --> 40:56.582
Tak.

40:57.124 --> 40:58.333
Did she accept?

41:00.627 --> 41:02.629
They agreed to talk more about it
down the road.

41:03.172 --> 41:04.464
But for now?

41:05.966 --> 41:07.301
She has no choice.

41:08.051 --> 41:10.888
She has to think of the kingdom.
We cannot afford another war.

41:10.971 --> 41:12.639
She promised to protect us.

41:12.723 --> 41:14.683
She has an entire kingdom to protect.

41:14.766 --> 41:16.852
And as prince and princess, so do we.

41:19.188 --> 41:21.732
You don't really think that you're going
to be king here, do you?

41:23.025 --> 41:24.526
One of us will succeed Mom.

41:24.610 --> 41:27.196
The people of Paya
would never allow a sighted king.

41:27.738 --> 41:30.365
And even if they did,
the Trivantians wouldn't allow it.

41:31.074 --> 41:33.035
You heard what they said there.

41:34.286 --> 41:37.623
Forget being king or queen, Kofun.
They don't even want us to exist!

41:37.706 --> 41:39.875
-Why are you so angry?
-Why are you not?

41:40.959 --> 41:42.794
We will never belong here.

41:43.795 --> 41:45.380
This isn't our world.

41:46.673 --> 41:48.175
This is where my family is.

41:50.761 --> 41:52.387
This is where I'll raise my son.

41:56.225 --> 41:58.602
Your son will always live
in a different world than you.

42:22.417 --> 42:24.461
My children will never forgive me.

42:25.838 --> 42:28.674
You saved thousands of lives,
including theirs.

42:29.883 --> 42:33.762
You formed the beginnings
of a true dialogue with Trivantes.

42:35.556 --> 42:37.683
But vision is once again forbidden.

42:39.601 --> 42:43.480
When I was young,
my father used to fish for salmon.

42:44.857 --> 42:46.775
Every autumn,
he'd bring me down to the river,

42:46.859 --> 42:48.068
and we'd fish.

42:49.194 --> 42:52.114
For the first few days,
we'd usually catch nothing.

42:53.532 --> 42:56.451
Then one day, we'd catch one.

42:57.828 --> 42:58.954
Two.

42:59.454 --> 43:01.498
Hardly enough for a household.

43:02.165 --> 43:05.002
But enough to know
that the next day there'd be more.

43:06.128 --> 43:08.714
Five salmon, ten salmon.

43:09.506 --> 43:13.010
Soon the entire river
would be teeming with salmon.

43:15.470 --> 43:17.514
Vision is coming back.

43:18.765 --> 43:21.977
You and I have met
the first few fish swimming upstream.

43:23.270 --> 43:24.563
More will come.

43:25.355 --> 43:27.357
Some are, no doubt, already here.

43:28.233 --> 43:29.610
Others will follow.

43:31.486 --> 43:35.532
No law, no religion will stop it.

43:38.785 --> 43:43.248
How we choose to handle it
within our borders is our business.

43:43.832 --> 43:46.627
The Trivantians
made their position very clear.

43:46.710 --> 43:50.297
Politicians following a script
they know nothing about.

43:51.089 --> 43:53.717
The war over vision will be fought,

43:53.800 --> 43:58.472
not between Paya and Trivantes,
but within cities.

44:00.057 --> 44:01.350
Within families.

44:03.060 --> 44:04.436
Within our own hearts.

44:06.188 --> 44:08.690
Regardless, nature will have its way.

44:09.900 --> 44:11.193
She always does.

44:14.821 --> 44:16.031
Well…

44:17.449 --> 44:19.785
you seem to have made
your own peace with it.

44:20.827 --> 44:23.747
The single advantage
to being as horribly wrong

44:23.830 --> 44:29.211
as I've been in my life
is that new ideas are easier to accept.

44:34.258 --> 44:36.176
Smells like death.

44:46.979 --> 44:49.481
I think Baba always knew
he would die in battle.

44:50.899 --> 44:51.900
He told me once,

44:52.401 --> 44:56.196
death must be earned
every bit as much as life.

44:57.739 --> 45:01.076
With his last breath,
he defeated an entire army.

45:01.577 --> 45:04.454
And by doing so, saved us all.

45:05.747 --> 45:07.541
I think his death was well earned.

45:09.168 --> 45:10.836
You sound a bit envious.

45:12.212 --> 45:13.255
Maybe.

45:14.923 --> 45:18.260
But while I'm still walking here
on this earth,

45:18.760 --> 45:21.471
I'll do my best
to keep you out of trouble.

45:30.522 --> 45:32.774
I would be lost without you, Tamacti.

45:33.650 --> 45:35.736
How so very sad for both of us.

45:45.704 --> 45:48.123
I miss him, Ranger.

45:50.667 --> 45:52.794
Baba was a giant man,

45:53.504 --> 45:56.381
so it makes sense
that there's a giant-sized hole

45:56.465 --> 45:58.258
in the space he used to fill.

46:02.596 --> 46:04.598
You know, Baba died for you.

46:05.516 --> 46:06.767
For all of us.

46:09.353 --> 46:12.272
But it's important
to remember not that he died for you,

46:13.273 --> 46:14.900
but that he lived for you.

46:16.485 --> 46:18.320
If he was here, that's what he would say.

46:25.118 --> 46:26.787
I hear Lu has arrived.

46:26.870 --> 46:28.205
Yes.

46:30.541 --> 46:32.292
Yes, we head home tomorrow.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.378
You're welcome to stay.

46:36.713 --> 46:41.176
Thanks, but Lu and I,

46:41.260 --> 46:46.890
we don't like crowds or people,
you know, crowds of people.

46:48.559 --> 46:50.352
Well, I could give you a horse.

46:52.646 --> 46:53.730
Nah.

46:55.232 --> 46:56.900
The wolves will just eat it.

47:08.620 --> 47:09.830
Haniwa!

47:11.707 --> 47:12.958
Charlotte?

47:16.461 --> 47:17.629
Haniwa!

47:17.713 --> 47:19.006
Charlotte!

47:23.093 --> 47:24.094
Hey.

47:25.137 --> 47:27.055
I didn't know if you were coming back.

47:27.139 --> 47:29.600
Nah, I'm not back. Not for long anyway.

47:30.601 --> 47:32.269
I just needed to make sure you were okay.

47:34.521 --> 47:36.231
I'm so sorry to hear about Baba.

47:37.482 --> 47:39.151
Then I heard that you
and Wren got married,

47:39.234 --> 47:40.819
and I'm so happy about that.

47:40.903 --> 47:43.697
And now I don't know if I should talk
about the sad thing first

47:43.780 --> 47:46.575
and then the happy thing?
Or do it the other way,

47:46.658 --> 47:48.243
or maybe you don't wanna talk
about it at all.

47:50.287 --> 47:54.875
How did it go with the Compass?
How are Sheva and the kids?

47:54.958 --> 47:56.168
Well, the little ones are great.

47:56.251 --> 47:58.128
I don't think Sheva
likes me very much.

47:58.212 --> 48:00.672
But I don't like her either,
so, you know, that'll work out.

48:02.466 --> 48:05.427
She asked me to give you this.

48:07.429 --> 48:08.972
She said you'd know what it means.

48:36.124 --> 48:38.126
She wishes you a safe journey.

48:39.127 --> 48:43.757
So… I take it you're going somewhere?

48:46.552 --> 48:48.053
Will you come with us?

48:50.639 --> 48:52.099
Not this time.

48:53.892 --> 48:55.769
But it's nice to be asked.

48:57.980 --> 48:59.565
Who will keep me safe?

49:01.942 --> 49:03.694
You have Wren for that now.

49:04.611 --> 49:06.029
And she has you.

49:06.822 --> 49:09.116
I am needed at the Compass.

49:10.075 --> 49:12.703
Jerlamarel's children
will be keeping us busy and…

49:13.453 --> 49:15.372
I get the feeling more will be coming.

49:16.707 --> 49:17.708
They are lucky to have you.

49:18.292 --> 49:20.127
Tell that to them.

49:20.210 --> 49:21.378
Little fuckers.

49:28.594 --> 49:30.345
You be careful out there.

49:31.805 --> 49:33.098
You too.

49:43.233 --> 49:44.735
Thank you.

49:47.029 --> 49:48.614
It was my pleasure.

49:49.698 --> 49:51.033
I'm not crying.

49:53.785 --> 49:55.370
Will you come find me?

49:59.416 --> 50:00.918
You're the sighted one.

50:02.377 --> 50:03.712
You come find me.

50:22.022 --> 50:23.732
Are you sure
you don't want to say goodbye?

50:26.193 --> 50:27.778
It wouldn't go well.

50:33.992 --> 50:35.285
I'll see them again.

51:05.148 --> 51:06.817
It's getting chilly.

51:08.110 --> 51:09.611
Winter will be here soon.

51:13.824 --> 51:16.535
It's been almost a year
and still no word from Haniwa.

51:17.870 --> 51:19.997
It could be a while till we hear from her.

51:21.123 --> 51:23.041
Do you ever think about the Alkenny?

51:24.209 --> 51:25.419
Every day.

51:26.170 --> 51:28.297
Just the four of us, always together.

51:29.423 --> 51:34.344
I'm sure we were sometimes cold,
but in my memories it's always warm.

51:37.723 --> 51:41.393
I thought when I became queen,

51:42.352 --> 51:44.313
I would be able to give us that.

51:45.480 --> 51:47.816
But once we set out
to find the Lavender road,

51:48.734 --> 51:51.153
we were never going
to be that family again.

51:52.029 --> 51:53.322
No.

51:53.989 --> 51:57.201
But we are still a family.

52:02.748 --> 52:04.791
You handle yourself well with the council.

52:05.792 --> 52:07.377
You've earned their trust.

52:09.546 --> 52:13.509
Maybe… you were born to do this.

52:13.592 --> 52:16.845
Well, Haniwa says the kingdom
would never accept a sighted king.

52:18.430 --> 52:19.848
What do you say?

52:23.018 --> 52:26.647
I know what Dad would say. He would say,

52:27.189 --> 52:29.858
"Think like a blind man.
Your eyes betray you."

52:36.907 --> 52:38.909
I think my eyes have betrayed me.

52:41.453 --> 52:42.871
And they will again.

52:46.083 --> 52:47.501
What are you saying?

52:50.462 --> 52:52.130
My mother is queen.

52:53.215 --> 52:55.634
My father died trying
to save this kingdom.

52:55.717 --> 52:58.262
If they weren't my people before,
they are now.

52:59.721 --> 53:02.766
I can't fully serve the people or my son

53:02.850 --> 53:04.977
if my sense
of the world is different from theirs.

53:09.940 --> 53:15.279
I'm saying, I think I've seen enough.

53:22.661 --> 53:25.914
I want to live in the same world
as my son.

53:29.626 --> 53:35.048
I want to hear, feel, smell what he does.

53:48.312 --> 53:49.313
Kofun.

53:51.481 --> 53:53.150
There's no going back.

53:55.652 --> 53:58.113
You'd have to be absolutely sure.

54:03.452 --> 54:04.828
I'm sure.

56:22.758 --> 56:23.759
You made it.

56:29.723 --> 56:30.724
You know us?

56:31.558 --> 56:34.436
No. Not yet anyway.

56:36.522 --> 56:39.608
But I am so glad you found us.

56:40.400 --> 56:42.653
As I'm sure you can imagine,

56:43.570 --> 56:47.115
everyone here has been
on a journey very similar to your own.

56:50.869 --> 56:54.039
I am Michaela. And you are?

56:56.416 --> 56:57.584
Haniwa.

57:02.923 --> 57:03.924
Wren.

57:05.425 --> 57:08.720
Welcome, Haniwa and Wren.

57:11.056 --> 57:15.644
Well, don't just stand there.
Come down and meet everyone.

57:50.470 --> 57:51.471
Welcome.

57:53.307 --> 57:54.600
Hi.

58:00.480 --> 58:02.232
Hi. Good to see you.

58:12.910 --> 58:13.911
Hi.
