02:53.890 --> 02:57.050
<i>Of all the words my father wrote,
and there were many.</i>

02:58.210 --> 02:59.930
<i>I remember these the most:</i>

03:01.010 --> 03:06.130
"Nothing that results from human progress,
is achieved with unanimous consent. "

03:06.170 --> 03:08.330
"And those who are enlightened
before the others...

03:08.410 --> 03:11.970
"... are condemned to pursue
that light in spite of others. "

03:13.850 --> 03:16.870
"There was a time
when the New World didn't exist. "

03:17.090 --> 03:21.150
"The sun set in the west on a notion,
where no man had dared to venture. "

03:21.490 --> 03:26.410
"And beyond that,
infinity!"

03:26.810 --> 03:29.050
Look!

03:29.290 --> 03:33.070
Now, half of the hull has gone.

03:33.250 --> 03:35.010
Good.

03:36.370 --> 03:38.570
And now?

03:39.690 --> 03:43.110
Now, I only see the mast.

03:48.890 --> 03:52.350
Close your eyes.
And don't cheat!

03:52.410 --> 03:54.470
I'm watching.

03:58.730 --> 04:01.670
Open them when I tell you.

04:02.530 --> 04:06.790
Once I asked my father
where he wanted to go.

04:06.930 --> 04:08.670
He replied:

04:08.770 --> 04:10.690
"I want to travel all over the seas. "

04:11.330 --> 04:14.830
"I want to get behind the weather. "

04:16.089 --> 04:17.010
Now.

04:19.329 --> 04:20.290
It's gone.

04:22.890 --> 04:25.370
What does it tell you?

04:33.970 --> 04:36.390
It's round, like this.

04:42.610 --> 04:44.370
Round!

04:47.610 --> 04:48.730
Come on, lad!

05:07.530 --> 05:09.390
Good morning, Father.

05:19.010 --> 05:20.470
Diego!

05:29.770 --> 05:31.170
Kiss your brother, Diego.

05:48.810 --> 05:50.370
I have something for you.

05:53.290 --> 05:57.530
You'll be heard
at the University of Salamanca.

05:58.970 --> 06:00.490
God! That's in a week!

06:00.530 --> 06:03.230
That's what it says.

06:09.170 --> 06:11.170
How did you manage it?

06:11.210 --> 06:12.890
With some difficulty.

06:12.930 --> 06:16.930
I had to promise them,
you weren't a total fool.

06:30.190 --> 06:35.910
Marco Polo said he found
Earthly Paradise off the coast of China.

06:36.410 --> 06:38.270
Do you believe this?

06:38.370 --> 06:43.410
I believe in Paradise and Hell.
And I do believe that both can be earthly.

06:44.330 --> 06:48.350
Now,
let's go through this again.

06:49.890 --> 06:53.190
Why do you wish to sail west?

06:53.570 --> 06:56.350
To open a new route to Asia.

06:56.430 --> 07:00.970
Asia is the richest Kingdom.
The land of spices and gold.

07:02.610 --> 07:05.350
At the moment there are
only two ways of reaching it.

07:05.410 --> 07:09.210
By sea, sailing around the
African continent...

07:09.245 --> 07:10.730
...the journey takes a year...

07:11.190 --> 07:15.730
...or by land. But the Turks
have closed this route to all Christians.

07:15.830 --> 07:18.690
There is a third way...

07:19.810 --> 07:23.030
...by sailing west
across the ocean sea.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.710
The distance is unknown.

07:27.770 --> 07:30.630
It's said to be infinite.

07:36.610 --> 07:37.890
Superstition!

07:37.930 --> 07:40.075
I believe the Indies are
no more than...

07:40.110 --> 07:44.530
...750 leagues
west of the Canary Islands.

07:44.550 --> 07:47.070
How can you be so certain?

07:47.130 --> 07:50.510
The calculations of Toscanelli,
Marin de Tyr...

07:50.570 --> 07:52.570
- ... Esdras...
- Esdras is a Jew!

07:52.650 --> 07:53.930
So was Christ!

07:53.990 --> 07:57.110
Two minutes
and already you're a dead man.

07:57.170 --> 07:59.130
- For telling the truth?
- Yes!

07:59.230 --> 08:01.870
They're burning people for less.

08:02.130 --> 08:03.990
The men you're about to confront...

08:04.030 --> 08:06.910
...have no emotions.

08:07.010 --> 08:09.630
You must learn to control
your passion.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.430
Passion is something
one cannot control.

08:12.510 --> 08:15.190
You need the blessing
of this commission.

08:15.230 --> 08:17.610
If they say no...

08:17.630 --> 08:20.410
...you would have to give up,
my son.

08:20.470 --> 08:22.610
I will not give up.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.390
Is it ambition?

08:24.430 --> 08:27.710
We've been told lies
for so long...

08:27.770 --> 08:31.090
...they said that
this was flat as this table...

08:31.150 --> 08:33.909
...that monsters guard
the edge of the world!

08:33.950 --> 08:37.750
I will not be told what to be afraid of
and what not to be afraid of!

08:37.830 --> 08:40.909
I want to find out for myself.

08:42.390 --> 08:47.190
I just hope your passion
will be contagious, my son.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.390
Look, father!

09:14.590 --> 09:16.250
Fernando!

10:05.630 --> 10:08.170
Do you repent your sins...

10:08.230 --> 10:10.210
...in the name of the Father...

10:10.270 --> 10:13.350
...the Son and the Holy Spirit?

11:40.510 --> 11:43.550
Burnings in the square!

12:03.870 --> 12:07.530
They agreed to see me
in a week in Salamanca.

12:18.150 --> 12:21.070
If my project is accepted,
I could be gone for years.

12:21.090 --> 12:22.710
I know!

12:25.470 --> 12:27.310
I haven't given you much of a life.

12:27.390 --> 12:31.750
That's true, I have a child
by a man who won't marry me!

12:31.830 --> 12:33.410
Are you going to argue?

12:33.430 --> 12:38.530
I'd love to argue with you
more often, but you're never here.

13:08.470 --> 13:13.050
Unfortunately, Senor Colombus,
that is precisely where our opinions differ.

13:13.110 --> 13:16.710
You're familiar with Aristotle?
Eratosthenes? Ptolemeus?

13:16.745 --> 13:18.910
I am, Your Eminence.

13:18.990 --> 13:22.750
Then you cannot ignore that according
to their calculations, the circumference...

13:22.785 --> 13:27.190
...of the Earth is approximately
22,000 leagues or more...

13:27.225 --> 13:29.750
...which makes the ocean uncrossable.

13:29.785 --> 13:33.570
But you may have found
new evidence...

13:33.590 --> 13:37.850
...proving these great men
of knowledge are totally mistaken!

13:41.630 --> 13:44.950
Your Excellencies are aware of
Marin de Tyr?

13:44.985 --> 13:46.550
We are!

13:46.630 --> 13:51.850
Then you are also aware that
his theories contradict Ptolemeus.

13:51.870 --> 13:55.950
De Tyr believes the ocean to be
only 750 leagues.

13:55.990 --> 13:57.590
DifferentiaToscanelli...

13:57.630 --> 14:01.530
...and the French Cardinal D'Ailly,
both think that Marin De Tyr...

14:01.590 --> 14:04.950
...is accurate in his calculations.

14:05.030 --> 14:09.250
And therefore
that the ocean can be crossed.

14:09.810 --> 14:11.310
Silence!

14:11.390 --> 14:17.070
Gentlemen, are we here to examine
this man's proposal, or not?

14:17.630 --> 14:21.470
Let's suppose for the moment
that Marin de Tyr is right.

14:21.550 --> 14:25.190
Senor Colombus, in your opinion then,
how long would the voyage be?

14:25.270 --> 14:26.490
Seven weeks.

14:26.590 --> 14:30.010
- Six, during the summer months.
- Marin de Tyr is wrong!

14:30.050 --> 14:34.870
He's been corrected many times, over
the centuries by the world's finest geographers.

14:34.910 --> 14:38.890
Your voyage, Senor Colombus,
would take a year.

14:39.510 --> 14:43.030
Suppose you cross this ocean
and suppose you reach Asia...

14:43.110 --> 14:45.810
...what would Spain do there?

14:45.910 --> 14:48.990
Trade, Your Excellency!

14:50.110 --> 14:55.990
According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom
of China is one of the richest of the world.

14:56.030 --> 14:58.890
Even the meanest buildings
are roofed with gold.

14:58.950 --> 15:03.070
Is that all that interests you?
Gold?

15:03.090 --> 15:04.355
No!

15:04.390 --> 15:06.830
I'll bring these people
to the world of God...

15:06.865 --> 15:11.270
...and make them subjects
of Castille and Aragon!

15:11.430 --> 15:13.510
Instead of a Realm...

15:13.550 --> 15:15.755
...Spain will become an Empire!

15:15.790 --> 15:18.490
If God intended
our proximity to Asia...

15:18.550 --> 15:22.650
...do you believe that he would have
waited for you to show it to the world?

15:22.710 --> 15:27.050
He chose a carpenter's son
to reveal Himself to the world!

15:27.110 --> 15:31.670
So you consider yourself
"The Chosen One"?

15:37.750 --> 15:40.510
Asia can be found to the west...

15:40.545 --> 15:43.890
...and I will prove it!

15:54.870 --> 15:58.790
The Treasurer of Spain
honours us with his presence.

15:59.070 --> 16:03.730
The State has its reasons to be interested
in this man's proposition, Your Eminence.

16:03.765 --> 16:06.470
With all due respect,
the judgement is ours.

16:06.530 --> 16:07.710
Why not?

16:07.790 --> 16:10.610
And what if he were right?

16:11.590 --> 16:16.490
I've always found
such independent minds dangerous.

16:16.550 --> 16:20.090
If the man had wings,
no doubt, he'd return from the skies...

16:20.190 --> 16:23.690
...tells the heavens are empty!

16:25.890 --> 16:29.770
I'd deplore the loss of
such a potential opportunity for Spain, though.

16:29.790 --> 16:32.170
Especially
over this point of geography.

16:32.270 --> 16:35.090
It's not a point of geography.
It's a point of reality.

16:35.110 --> 16:37.410
This man is a mercenary.

16:37.470 --> 16:40.010
States often use mercenaries...

16:40.070 --> 16:45.850
...if it is to the benefit,
the stability of Spain, no?

16:46.050 --> 16:50.610
It should be as much your concern
as it is mine.

16:51.790 --> 16:56.210
Am I to understand, that you would
use your influence to assist this heretic?

16:56.370 --> 17:02.610
Well, you know, Your Eminence,
the fascinating thing about power...

17:03.150 --> 17:07.150
...is that, what could be given
so effortlessly...

17:09.869 --> 17:13.310
...so easily be taken away!

17:28.349 --> 17:32.990
And therefore nothing could justify
the participation of Your Majesties...

17:33.030 --> 17:36.650
...in a venture that relies upon
such feeble assumptions...

17:36.710 --> 17:39.830
...and which any man of knowledge...

17:39.870 --> 17:44.070
...would take to be impractical,
if not impossible.

17:44.110 --> 17:47.470
They didn't listen.
They don't want to listen.

17:47.550 --> 17:50.370
- You mustn't give way to despair, you must wait.
- Wait?

17:50.430 --> 17:53.590
I've waited seven years already,
how much longer do you want me to wait?

17:53.610 --> 17:54.930
If God intends you to go,
you will go!

17:55.030 --> 17:56.655
- Damn God!
- Christopher!

17:56.690 --> 18:01.790
Damn all of you! You all sit at your desks,
concocting theories based on what?

18:01.825 --> 18:04.410
You never leave the protection
of your gardens. Go out...

18:04.470 --> 18:08.130
...find out what the world is about
and then tell me something I can accept.

18:08.150 --> 18:12.430
These don't mean anything,
they are full of assumptions!

18:15.590 --> 18:17.290
Just lies!

18:17.590 --> 18:19.410
All of it, lies!

18:27.430 --> 18:29.510
All of it, lies!

18:49.270 --> 18:50.770
Father?

18:50.830 --> 18:55.410
You must not speak to a man
doing penance.

18:57.750 --> 19:00.110
And what can you do?

19:00.190 --> 19:04.190
Nothing.
That's the point, Fernando.

19:08.590 --> 19:10.690
Fernando!

19:50.850 --> 19:53.170
Senor Colombus?

19:54.050 --> 19:56.450
I've been looking
all over Sevilla for you.

19:56.530 --> 20:00.830
Never expected to find a sailor
in a monastery.

20:01.350 --> 20:02.695
My name is Pinzon.

20:02.730 --> 20:06.950
Martin Alonzo Pinzon.
I'm a ship owner from Palos.

20:11.630 --> 20:13.630
Is he a spy?

20:19.710 --> 20:22.370
What is it?
Are you a trappist?

20:22.430 --> 20:24.330
Vow of silence?

20:24.390 --> 20:25.435
Penance?

20:25.470 --> 20:27.510
It's just my luck.

20:27.670 --> 20:29.550
Listen,
I'll do the talking for both of us.

20:29.650 --> 20:31.195
You just nod, agreed?

20:31.230 --> 20:33.410
Just as I do with the wife.

20:33.550 --> 20:36.150
I know that the commission
turned you down, right?

20:36.185 --> 20:38.630
What do you expect?
You're just a foreigner.

20:38.670 --> 20:40.830
And I want to help you.

20:40.910 --> 20:44.150
You wonder why I believe in you?
I'm a seaman, too.

20:44.190 --> 20:48.090
We don't like to be told
where to go or not to go.

20:50.070 --> 20:52.510
I don't look like much
but I have friends...

20:52.590 --> 20:53.990
...important friends!

20:54.190 --> 20:56.310
A banker, for example.

20:56.390 --> 20:58.950
He finances me.
He's name is Santangel.

20:58.990 --> 21:00.950
Have you heard of him?

21:01.030 --> 21:03.510
He can get you
in audience with the Queen.

21:03.590 --> 21:05.155
You know why?

21:05.190 --> 21:07.330
She owes him money.
That's for it is.

21:07.350 --> 21:12.050
You, me, the Queen, the world and its
mysteries! Everybody owes somebody something.

21:12.090 --> 21:14.130
What do you say?

21:14.790 --> 21:18.970
- Where can I meet this man?
- Here, right there!

21:24.610 --> 21:26.310
May I ask you a question,
Don Luis?

21:26.350 --> 21:27.570
Yes!

21:27.990 --> 21:30.650
Why do you want to help me?

21:32.750 --> 21:34.270
Faith...

21:34.350 --> 21:36.210
...hope...

21:36.270 --> 21:38.290
...charity!

21:39.750 --> 21:43.030
But greater than all these...

21:43.350 --> 21:46.010
...is banking.

22:45.510 --> 22:48.810
Wait, Senores!

22:50.790 --> 22:53.270
The Moors built Granada
centuries ago.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.150
Now, we've taken it back.

22:55.190 --> 22:59.530
But it's a tragic victory for us.
We're losing a great culture.

23:03.390 --> 23:06.710
But I suppose there's a price
to be paid for every victory.

23:06.745 --> 23:09.830
Isn't there Senor Colombus?

23:27.550 --> 23:29.110
Don Luis de Santangel...

23:29.190 --> 23:31.710
...to see Don Gabriel Sanchez.

23:31.790 --> 23:32.790
Luis!

23:44.270 --> 23:47.790
Senor Columbus, Senor Pinzon.

24:29.270 --> 24:32.670
Rise!
Come forward!

24:34.470 --> 24:39.170
I should not even be listening to you
since my Council has said no.

24:39.190 --> 24:42.550
Santangel tells me
you're a man of honour and sincerety.

24:42.585 --> 24:46.250
Sanchez,
you're not completely mad.

24:46.750 --> 24:51.650
No more than the woman who said
she would take Granada from the Moors.

24:51.910 --> 24:57.410
They believe the ocean is
uncrossable, Senor Columbus.

24:57.510 --> 25:02.070
What did they say about Granada,
before today?

25:07.190 --> 25:10.330
That it was impregnable!

25:19.950 --> 25:23.150
I cannot ignore the verdict
of my Council.

25:23.190 --> 25:26.390
Surely you can do anything
you want.

25:28.110 --> 25:31.110
How little you know!

25:32.710 --> 25:36.770
Why should I believe in you,
Senor Colombus?

25:40.150 --> 25:41.715
May I speak freely?

25:41.750 --> 25:44.330
You show no inclination
to speak otherwise.

25:44.390 --> 25:46.490
I know what I see.

25:46.510 --> 25:49.430
I see someone who doesn't
accept the world as it is.

25:49.465 --> 25:51.630
Who's not afraid.

25:51.830 --> 25:56.570
- I see a woman who thinks what if...
- A woman?

25:58.470 --> 26:00.630
Forgive me...

26:01.350 --> 26:03.870
...but you're the only Queen I know.

26:03.990 --> 26:09.250
Then that makes us equal,
you're the only navigator that I know.

26:12.550 --> 26:15.750
How old are you,
Senor Colombus?

26:16.190 --> 26:19.210
Thirty-nine, Your Majesty.

26:19.430 --> 26:21.510
And you?

26:22.590 --> 26:25.250
I'm forty.

26:29.110 --> 26:32.790
You will be informed
of our decision.

26:46.350 --> 26:50.350
Actually, I thought
you were younger than I.

27:02.750 --> 27:05.790
The cost would be ruinous.

27:05.830 --> 27:10.070
No more than the cost of
two state banquets.

27:15.790 --> 27:20.830
Two banquets,
for new lands and spices...

27:20.870 --> 27:22.950
...and gold!

27:22.990 --> 27:26.030
What are you saying, Sanchez?

27:27.310 --> 27:31.370
Only that if he's right,
we have everything to gain.

27:31.670 --> 27:33.950
And if he's wrong...

27:33.990 --> 27:37.010
...we've so little to lose.

27:57.390 --> 27:59.275
Tell me what he says.

27:59.310 --> 28:01.930
He demands to be made a Knight...

28:01.990 --> 28:04.710
...with the right to wear
the Golden Spurs...

28:04.750 --> 28:08.790
...and that he will receive
the title "Don Christopher Colombus"...

28:08.830 --> 28:14.230
...which will be extended
to his descendants.

28:17.430 --> 28:18.595
So, what else?

28:18.630 --> 28:21.570
He'll be named
"Great Admiral of the Ocean Sea"...

28:21.605 --> 28:23.755
...Viceroy of the West Indies...

28:23.790 --> 28:27.810
...Governor of all islands
or lands discovered...

28:27.830 --> 28:32.170
...or as will be discovered
by him...

28:32.230 --> 28:35.590
The highest titles of nobility,
Your Excellency...

28:35.630 --> 28:40.230
...to an immigrant
sheltered by monks!

28:46.430 --> 28:47.750
Furthermore...

28:47.830 --> 28:51.930
...he'll receive
one tenth of all wealth or monies...

28:51.990 --> 28:57.490
...precious gems, pearls, metals,
spices and other lucrative sources...

28:57.510 --> 29:01.930
...acquired under his jurisdiction.

29:05.430 --> 29:08.490
You worry too much, Francisco!

29:09.110 --> 29:11.790
This man will have
to lower his demands.

29:11.870 --> 29:13.930
Believe me!

29:15.090 --> 29:17.830
He will!

29:18.870 --> 29:20.730
I won't!

29:20.750 --> 29:25.630
So we have considered your proposal
very carefuly, Senor Columbus. It is excessive.

29:25.670 --> 29:28.790
- The responsibility is equally excessive.
- If you consider of the contract...

29:28.850 --> 29:30.190
- I have given you that!
- No!

29:30.230 --> 29:32.830
- No?
- No!

29:33.331 --> 29:34.331
No!

29:34.530 --> 29:37.110
And I thought he was an idealist.

29:37.150 --> 29:39.730
Idealism and ambition
are not incompatible.

29:39.810 --> 29:44.230
I've fought too hard.
Now you expect me to take all the risks...

29:44.265 --> 29:46.670
- ... while you take the profit?
- No!

29:46.790 --> 29:49.230
- I'm not a servant...
- Senor Colombus...

29:49.265 --> 29:53.610
...you are in no position
to bargain with me.

29:53.690 --> 29:55.195
I'm not bargaining.

29:55.230 --> 29:58.250
Then you are too ambitious.

29:59.990 --> 30:03.510
And were you never ambitious?

30:05.750 --> 30:10.350
Or, is ambition only a virtue among
nobles, a fault for the rest of us?

30:10.430 --> 30:15.350
If you won't accept this proposal,
we can simply find someone who will.

30:15.430 --> 30:20.510
If you can do that, Excellency...

30:23.030 --> 30:26.410
...I'll become a monk!

30:50.350 --> 30:52.130
Your Majesty!

30:54.070 --> 30:57.070
He'll become a monk!

30:57.110 --> 31:00.210
It would be a pity,
wouldn't it?

31:00.350 --> 31:02.910
Call him back!

31:11.350 --> 31:13.590
She said "yes".

31:22.390 --> 31:24.110
If I ever come back,
I swear...

31:24.190 --> 31:27.390
I'm not asking you
to swear to anything.

31:27.430 --> 31:29.410
I don't want you
to wait for me.

31:29.430 --> 31:33.450
That's something
you can't decide for me.

32:13.190 --> 32:16.290
Forgive me Father, I have sinned.

32:16.950 --> 32:19.950
I am listening, my son.

32:20.030 --> 32:24.490
Father...
I have betrayed my family...

32:24.590 --> 32:26.430
...I betrayed my men...

32:26.510 --> 32:29.750
...and I betrayed you.

32:30.530 --> 32:31.910
I lied!

32:31.990 --> 32:35.050
The journey will be longer
than I said.

32:35.710 --> 32:37.130
How long?

32:37.150 --> 32:38.615
I'm not sure.

32:38.650 --> 32:43.370
How could anyone know.
It could be twice the distance.

32:43.470 --> 32:45.235
You must tell them.

32:45.270 --> 32:48.230
- You must tell your men.
- If I tell them, they wouldn't follow me.

32:48.265 --> 32:51.510
You know I'm right, father.
You must trust me.

32:51.530 --> 32:56.470
You must speak to them.
If you don't, I will!

32:57.470 --> 33:00.330
You are bounded by an oath.

33:00.350 --> 33:02.890
May God forgive you.

33:02.930 --> 33:06.430
I believed in you.

33:09.030 --> 33:12.030
Give me absolution.

33:13.910 --> 33:16.990
Give me absolution, Father!

33:18.470 --> 33:22.490
I absolve you of your sins!

36:40.110 --> 36:41.570
Enter!

36:45.030 --> 36:46.490
Mendez!

36:47.790 --> 36:49.350
Sit down!

36:53.470 --> 36:55.490
Some wine?

37:04.350 --> 37:07.830
What is it, Mendez?
Speak!

37:11.510 --> 37:16.710
They wonder how you know our position
since we've no sight of land days ago.

37:17.110 --> 37:20.130
And what do you think, Mendez?

37:20.990 --> 37:24.610
I know you're navigating
by the stars like the Moors do...

37:24.670 --> 37:27.570
...but I don't know how?

37:32.710 --> 37:35.430
Take this quadrant, Mendez.

37:49.790 --> 37:52.910
Find the North Star.

37:58.790 --> 38:00.930
Steady yourself!

38:04.070 --> 38:07.090
Keep the plumbline vertical.

38:13.070 --> 38:14.790
And don't move!

38:14.870 --> 38:19.290
A mistake of one degree
and we'll be off 600 leagues.

38:19.670 --> 38:22.110
What do you read?

38:22.470 --> 38:24.570
-28.
- That's it!

38:24.670 --> 38:29.230
28th parallel!
And we'll follow it until we reach land.

38:30.670 --> 38:34.570
How do you know that
we'll find land on the 28th parallel?

38:36.030 --> 38:38.710
I don't!

39:50.569 --> 39:52.369
Mark!

39:55.870 --> 39:59.690
- Mark 26, Sir!
- Mark!

40:03.230 --> 40:05.890
Mark 27, Sir!

40:06.391 --> 40:07.891
Mark!

40:12.150 --> 40:15.010
Mark 28!

40:15.011 --> 40:16.711
Mark!

40:20.510 --> 40:22.510
Mark 29!

40:23.870 --> 40:28.530
-629.
-629!

40:29.630 --> 40:32.150
629, Sir?

40:32.830 --> 40:34.950
I heard.

40:39.390 --> 40:42.050
Captain, I don't understand.

40:42.110 --> 40:44.690
I think I do.

41:07.670 --> 41:10.210
We should've seen land.

41:10.590 --> 41:15.370
We've been at sea nine weeks, Alonzo.
Can't be that far.

41:16.470 --> 41:18.730
Can't be that near.

41:21.150 --> 41:23.850
Also I don't like the smell
of this sea around here.

41:23.910 --> 41:25.530
Smells like a whore!

41:25.630 --> 41:26.710
'Course it does.

41:27.710 --> 41:31.330
That's why sailors take to the sea.

41:31.710 --> 41:34.410
And why does that one
take to the sea?

41:34.530 --> 41:36.430
Nobody knows!

41:36.750 --> 41:39.330
Never says a word.

41:40.390 --> 41:44.450
Captain Pinzon requests
permission to board.

41:52.990 --> 41:55.670
You misled me.
You lied to me.

41:55.710 --> 41:57.870
We are way past 750 leagues.

41:57.950 --> 42:01.170
- Six days ago, yes.
- You must be mad!

42:01.470 --> 42:02.970
Keep your voice down, Pinzon!

42:02.990 --> 42:06.570
- We're in the verge of a mutiny, Colombus!
- You think I don't know that?

42:06.605 --> 42:08.850
We're lost!

42:11.470 --> 42:15.110
- The land is there, I know it.
- No, you don't know anything!

42:15.150 --> 42:18.915
Listen Colombus, these are my ships, right?
So I'm telling you we are turning back.

42:18.950 --> 42:22.870
And then what? Half of the water
has gone, the rest is nearly putrid!

42:22.950 --> 42:25.110
I shouldn't have listened to you.
You bloody...

42:25.190 --> 42:27.250
Listen!
Pinzon, Pinzon!

42:27.290 --> 42:29.690
All we can do...

42:31.150 --> 42:33.310
...is go forward.

42:33.350 --> 42:37.530
The land is there...
The land is close!

42:37.550 --> 42:41.110
You tell them that.
You say that to them!

42:52.830 --> 42:58.010
God doesn't want us to cross
this ocean. This voyage is cursed.

42:58.430 --> 43:02.250
We set sail for greed.
God has abandoned us.

43:02.270 --> 43:07.010
The voyage is cursed.
There are signs.

43:16.430 --> 43:18.830
Juanito has the voice of an angel.

43:18.870 --> 43:23.950
What comes out of his mouth is blessed,
Alonzo, what comes out of yours is cursed.

43:31.270 --> 43:32.710
Listen to me!

43:32.730 --> 43:35.215
Every man is afraid
who does something for the first time.

43:35.250 --> 43:40.310
But those who overcome their fears
will rightly earn their rewards.

43:41.550 --> 43:45.110
I don't know if it's God will
that we should cross this ocean.

43:45.190 --> 43:51.730
But I am certain it is you
who puts fear into our hearts.

43:53.550 --> 43:58.810
We cannot be lost as long as
we keep faith in God and in ourselves.

44:02.270 --> 44:05.110
In time...

44:05.230 --> 44:10.390
...they will talk about the courage of the
first men who crossed this ocean, and returned.

44:10.410 --> 44:12.990
And then you will be able
to say to them...

44:13.010 --> 44:15.510
...I was on the Pinta...

44:15.550 --> 44:17.650
...I was on the Nina...

44:17.750 --> 44:21.950
...and the Santa Maria.

44:27.110 --> 44:29.370
This jacket to the first man
who sights land.

44:29.430 --> 44:32.550
And 10,000 maravedis
a year for life!

44:32.585 --> 44:36.610
I wanna man aloft
day and night!

44:50.130 --> 44:51.650
Alonzo...

44:51.710 --> 44:54.970
...don't let this wind escape us!

45:00.750 --> 45:02.850
Lucky bastard!

46:54.230 --> 46:55.650
<i>Mendez!</i>

46:55.830 --> 46:57.170
Mendez!

47:03.270 --> 47:05.270
Land!

47:27.870 --> 47:30.270
<i>25 fathoms!</i>

47:35.470 --> 47:37.770
<i>24 fathoms!</i>

47:40.571 --> 47:42.771
<i>23!</i>

47:45.572 --> 47:47.772
<i>22!</i>

47:50.373 --> 47:52.573
<i>21!</i>

47:56.274 --> 47:58.574
<i>20!</i>

48:01.175 --> 48:03.375
<i>19!</i>

48:06.476 --> 48:08.676
<i>18!</i>

48:11.977 --> 48:14.177
<i>17!</i>

48:18.278 --> 48:20.578
<i>16!</i>

48:22.779 --> 48:24.979
<i>15!</i>

48:29.780 --> 48:31.980
<i>14!</i>

48:40.481 --> 48:42.681
<i>13!</i>

48:43.590 --> 48:45.850
There!

48:55.670 --> 48:58.730
Land ho!

49:15.150 --> 49:17.570
Drop anchor!

52:06.350 --> 52:08.910
Don Christopher!

52:35.230 --> 52:37.810
Excellencia!

52:54.150 --> 52:56.230
By the...

52:57.950 --> 53:01.690
...by the Grace of God!

53:06.110 --> 53:11.990
In the name of their
Gracious Majesties of Castilla and Aragon!

53:27.190 --> 53:31.250
By all the powers vested in me...

53:32.510 --> 53:36.030
...I claim this island
and name it...

53:36.430 --> 53:39.950
...San Salvador!

56:23.950 --> 56:26.370
Don Christopher!

56:44.430 --> 56:47.470
- Muskets!
- No!

01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:14.750
October 21st, 1492.

01:00:15.790 --> 01:00:18.910
I think we have returned to Eden.

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:24.290
Surely this is how the world was
in the beginning of time.

01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:27.450
If the natives are
to be converted to our ways...

01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:32.410
...then it will be by persuasion
and not by force.

01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:38.070
I believe no man will ever see
this land again as we do, for the first time.

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:41.610
We come in peace
and with honour.

01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:44.790
They are not savages,
neither will we be.

01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:49.170
Treat them as you would
your own wives and children.

01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:51.490
Respect their beliefs.

01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:56.610
Pillage will be punished by the whip.
Rape, by the sword.

01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:45.310
You!

01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:48.990
Utapan!

01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:51.250
Utapan?

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:54.670
Colombus!

01:01:55.190 --> 01:02:00.110
- Co... Columb...
- Colombus!

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:03.410
Co... lombus!

01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:28.570
Where did you find this?

01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:31.690
Cuba!

01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:28.010
Thanks!
I've got a river of gold to piss.

01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:54.630
Here!

01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:02.890
- Is it gold?
- No, no!

01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:05.030
No good, no.

01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:47.890
Utapan!

01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:50.835
<i>Utapan!</i>

01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:53.290
<i>Alonzo! Alonzo!</i>

01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:58.530
<i>Help him!</i>

01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:02.170
<i>Help him!</i>

01:05:10.070 --> 01:05:12.630
Do something!

01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:15.050
<i>Pray for him!</i>

01:05:15.951 --> 01:05:18.051
<i>Pray for him!</i>

01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:39.550
<i>With Alonzo's death, I realise
how vulnerable we are in these islands.</i>

01:05:39.585 --> 01:05:42.590
<i>How much we have to learn!</i>

01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:45.310
<i>On every island...</i>

01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:50.930
<i>...the natives welcome us
with great generosity and trust.</i>

01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:56.550
<i>Because of our appearance
we have been mistaken for gods...</i>

01:05:56.590 --> 01:05:59.270
<i>...and are treated accordingly.</i>

01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:03.810
Despite the compliance of the Indians
we have not found gold in quantity...

01:06:03.830 --> 01:06:09.590
...except for the few artefacts
they gave us as a sign of their submission.

01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:19.189
You will speak first.

01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:23.430
Tell him, we thank him
for his hospitality.

01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:26.290
He knows.

01:08:26.350 --> 01:08:31.550
Tell him, some of my men
are staying here to build a fort.

01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:35.029
I want them to be well treated.

01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:36.314
Tell him...

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:39.189
...we'll come back.
Many of us.

01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:43.750
He said, how many?

01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:49.590
As many as the leaves
on that tree.

01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:53.149
And many more will follow.

01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:58.470
Why?

01:08:58.910 --> 01:09:02.770
To bring the word of God.

01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:06.630
He said he has a God.

01:09:06.670 --> 01:09:09.710
And also to bring medicine.

01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:20.390
- He said, he...
- He has medicine!

01:09:21.270 --> 01:09:22.590
Tell him...

01:09:22.649 --> 01:09:25.350
...we admire his people.

01:09:36.790 --> 01:09:41.370
He knows
you like his women and gold.

01:09:51.790 --> 01:09:54.109
<i>Pinzon is ill...</i>

01:09:54.130 --> 01:09:57.770
<i>...eaten up by a fever
that refuses to leave his body.</i>

01:09:57.790 --> 01:10:01.030
<i>We must return to Spain.</i>

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:05.790
39 men have volunteered
to stay behind to build a fort.

01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:09.890
I name it, La Navidad!

01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:31.950
<i>After 7 months,
I haven't seen any sign of civilisation...</i>

01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:35.755
<i>...that compares
with Marco Polo's descriptions.</i>

01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:42.250
<i>No cities, no bridges,
no temples roofed with gold.</i>

01:10:42.670 --> 01:10:45.670
<i>The mainland still escapes me...</i>

01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:48.470
<i>...but I know it's there.</i>

01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:54.670
<i>My ships are not filled with
the spices and gold that I was hoping for...</i>

01:10:54.705 --> 01:10:58.650
<i>...but this land intoxicates
my senses and my soul.</i>

01:10:58.670 --> 01:11:03.430
<i>And all I can think of
is to return to this untamed land.</i>

01:11:03.465 --> 01:11:05.710
<i>This unexplored Eden.</i>

01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:09.830
<i>This is a chance
for a new beginning.</i>

01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:08.290
It won't be easy
to get rid of your prophet now.

01:13:09.230 --> 01:13:11.910
On the contrary...

01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:16.010
...it seems to me
the man is preparing his own cross.

01:13:57.870 --> 01:14:01.890
Let the palate enjoy
the flavour of the tobacco.

01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:04.150
Try!

01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:23.350
You say
this is an Indian vice?

01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:27.710
I don't see the pleasure
that would make this is sin.

01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:32.850
The Indians
have no such word, Moxica.

01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:36.550
Have they such thoughts?

01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:40.390
They come and go
as naked as God created them.

01:14:40.425 --> 01:14:44.130
God?
Which God?

01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:53.830
Nature is their God.

01:14:54.230 --> 01:14:57.050
It's as if God and Nature
were one.

01:14:57.150 --> 01:15:02.150
They see him in a leaf,
in a stone...

01:15:02.190 --> 01:15:05.210
...in a shell.

01:15:08.190 --> 01:15:10.410
The islands...

01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:13.610
...are covered with trees.

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:16.650
Forgive me, Don Cristobal!

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:19.930
What about gold?

01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:23.410
It's not the purest metal
I've ever seen.

01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:26.010
Is there more?

01:16:29.070 --> 01:16:33.610
We are more than gratified,
Christobal.

01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:29.310
Excellent!

01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:41.990
- You defende yourself well.
- For a commoner?

01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:45.410
So...

01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:48.790
...your second expedition, hm?

01:17:49.450 --> 01:17:51.590
17 ships...

01:17:51.690 --> 01:17:54.410
...and 1.500 men?

01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:56.450
Thanks to you.

01:17:56.530 --> 01:17:59.550
Don Christopher Colombus!
Don Francisco de Bobadilla!

01:17:59.570 --> 01:18:01.950
He can be extremely valuable to you.

01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:05.990
This man is
very well acquainted with our laws.

01:18:14.770 --> 01:18:17.310
I heard that you soon be
appointing Governors for the Islands...

01:18:17.311 --> 01:18:21.211
...and I thought
you might consider my application.

01:18:23.050 --> 01:18:24.930
Forgive me, Don Francisco.

01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:28.750
Those positions are
already taken.

01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:31.830
May I ask by whom?

01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:35.370
By two very competent men.

01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:38.410
I trust they're men of quality.

01:18:41.010 --> 01:18:45.330
Francisco is qualified
for high administration.

01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:47.450
Well...

01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:50.650
...we do lack notaries.

01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:54.630
You should contact
my administration.

01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:59.890
- Francisco is a judge.
- Good!

01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:02.290
We also need judges...

01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:06.030
...except,
there are no crimes of people!

01:19:06.610 --> 01:19:10.190
I see I was mistaken.

01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:15.790
Colombus has no need
for my services, Sanchez.

01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:22.490
You have a special talent
for making enemies.

01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:25.590
Why do I have
so many already?

01:19:31.690 --> 01:19:37.430
Don't you think to rise so high
in so short a time is a dangerous occupation?

01:19:53.170 --> 01:19:54.930
Beatrix!

01:19:56.850 --> 01:20:01.930
I can arrange for the Queen to take
Fernando and Diego into her service.

01:20:02.570 --> 01:20:05.070
It's a great honour,
Beatrix.

01:20:05.370 --> 01:20:07.430
We couldn't hope for
anything better.

01:20:07.450 --> 01:20:11.430
Anything better?
Better than to stay with his mother?

01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:13.015
It's not what I meant.

01:20:13.050 --> 01:20:16.030
- Then, what do you mean?
- I'll be gone...

01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:18.450
...for several years.

01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:21.630
I have enemies at the courts,
powerful enemies!

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:25.230
The boys bear my name
and now my titles.

01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:27.790
This way they'll be untouchable.

01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:31.690
And you'll be free to see them
whenever you please.

01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:37.330
You don't realize
what you're asking.

01:20:37.370 --> 01:20:38.490
I do!

01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:45.170
I wish I could have
offered you another life.

01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:51.610
I am sorry!

01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:54.510
Don't say you're sorry,
because you're not!

01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:56.930
You lead a life
you chose for yourself...

01:20:57.970 --> 01:21:00.650
...and I chose you!

01:21:24.250 --> 01:21:25.990
You might have given us
a choice, for Christ's sake!

01:21:25.991 --> 01:21:27.191
I'm a map maker!

01:21:27.210 --> 01:21:30.630
And now you're
Lieutenant-General of the West Indies...

01:21:30.631 --> 01:21:32.131
...congratulations, Bartolome!

01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:35.150
He's just out of seminary
he's hardly used the sword.

01:21:35.210 --> 01:21:37.750
I've never touched the sword!

01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:40.330
You have plenty of time to learn.

01:21:40.450 --> 01:21:43.350
What are you complaining about?

01:21:45.490 --> 01:21:47.890
You both have a chance to live
the way we can only dream of.

01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:50.990
I never shared those dreams!

01:21:51.330 --> 01:21:53.750
Do you refuse to help me?

01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:56.450
To help your brother?

01:21:57.450 --> 01:22:00.490
Are you going to desert me?

01:22:04.330 --> 01:22:08.490
You bastard!
You always had your own way.

01:22:08.530 --> 01:22:10.970
- I have always been here to support you.
- I know.

01:22:11.005 --> 01:22:13.410
- I went to Portugal to help you...
- Yes, I know!

01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:17.290
- I'm the eldest!
- How could we ever forget?

01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:20.090
Haven't you said it enough?

01:22:22.090 --> 01:22:25.130
Come on,
let me show you something.

01:22:27.690 --> 01:22:29.050
Excellency!

01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:31.530
It's about my son!

01:22:55.090 --> 01:22:56.510
See?

01:22:56.690 --> 01:23:00.310
Now, you tell me,
who can I trust?

01:23:01.450 --> 01:23:03.950
We're brothers.
A bloodline.

01:23:04.050 --> 01:23:06.990
I need you.
Both of you!

01:23:07.050 --> 01:23:07.870
Admiral!

01:23:07.930 --> 01:23:12.190
The horses have arrived.
Here is the magnificent pair!

01:23:12.210 --> 01:23:15.050
- Send them Back!
- What?

01:23:15.210 --> 01:23:17.830
They look like mules!

01:23:19.010 --> 01:23:21.510
I hope you have better luck
with personal!

01:23:21.570 --> 01:23:23.250
Who did we take on today?

01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:28.490
30 blacksmiths. 28 halberdiers.
20 carpenters.

01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:30.270
100 farmers.

01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:32.190
20 miners.

01:23:32.210 --> 01:23:35.730
And Doctor Chanca,
the Royal surgeon.

01:23:35.850 --> 01:23:39.530
Then we can count on royal health!

01:24:37.450 --> 01:24:39.270
Fire!

01:24:40.110 --> 01:24:42.270
Fire again!

01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:51.070
Where are they?

01:24:58.650 --> 01:25:02.650
Drummers, sound the advance!

01:25:51.210 --> 01:25:52.830
Almirante!

01:26:11.490 --> 01:26:13.290
Juanito!

01:26:24.450 --> 01:26:27.590
Is this your New World,
Almirante?

01:26:27.690 --> 01:26:30.250
These animals wish to learn savagery,
we shall teach them!

01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:33.530
Three heads for every life taken.
No mercy before God!

01:26:33.570 --> 01:26:34.490
Vamonos!

01:26:34.730 --> 01:26:36.550
No Moxica, no!

01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:39.530
There will be no revenge.

01:26:46.090 --> 01:26:48.250
These were our cousins...

01:26:48.330 --> 01:26:50.910
...our friends, our countrymen.

01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:54.250
But you say no revenge?

01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:57.830
We will wash this in blood
and now!

01:26:58.850 --> 01:27:02.910
If you want to keep your head
on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.

01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:05.930
I lost friends, too.

01:27:06.010 --> 01:27:08.970
39 brave men who trusted me.

01:27:09.370 --> 01:27:12.490
You want war?
Fine.

01:27:12.850 --> 01:27:16.790
We are 1000.
They outnumber us by 10.

01:27:16.930 --> 01:27:19.870
Who will you kill?
Which tribe?

01:27:19.930 --> 01:27:22.710
- We don't need to know.
- Moxica!

01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:26.990
Try to remember
who you are talking to.

01:27:31.050 --> 01:27:34.930
We came here to stay,
not to start a crusade.

01:27:35.370 --> 01:27:38.070
So, we will swallow our anger.

01:27:38.210 --> 01:27:41.190
And in the name of those
who died...

01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:45.070
...we will accomplish
what we came for.

01:28:16.490 --> 01:28:18.850
They're here.

01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:08.870
There!

01:30:10.290 --> 01:30:13.630
Guarionex!
Ricardo!

01:30:14.050 --> 01:30:16.510
Arquebuses!

01:30:16.970 --> 01:30:19.090
Preparen!

01:30:36.810 --> 01:30:38.790
Ask him!

01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:41.770
What happened to my men?

01:30:45.730 --> 01:30:47.790
Warriors come from the sea.

01:30:47.850 --> 01:30:50.850
Caribes.
Guarionex says...

01:30:50.890 --> 01:30:53.210
...all fled to the hills.

01:30:53.230 --> 01:30:54.470
When they came back...

01:30:54.570 --> 01:30:57.050
...all the Spaniards had gone.

01:30:57.085 --> 01:30:59.810
God's mercy on them all.

01:31:04.930 --> 01:31:07.630
The monkey's lying.

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:11.770
Colomb, you talk too much.

01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:15.490
Here they are.
We should kill them.

01:31:15.730 --> 01:31:19.430
No!
You'll do it my way.

01:31:22.450 --> 01:31:25.970
Tell him
we will not harm his people.

01:31:26.010 --> 01:31:29.550
Even though we have
the power to do it.

01:31:31.170 --> 01:31:33.975
I'm prepared to believe him.

01:31:34.010 --> 01:31:37.690
We will work with his people
and we want peace.

01:31:39.090 --> 01:31:41.690
Ask if he understands.

01:31:44.690 --> 01:31:46.510
He understands.

01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:48.590
Will he help?

01:31:53.170 --> 01:31:56.810
He says, you know the answer!

01:34:33.770 --> 01:34:37.750
Moxica...
I need your horses.

01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:40.990
My horse does no work.

01:34:41.050 --> 01:34:43.270
We all have to work, Moxica.

01:34:43.330 --> 01:34:46.310
Not my horse!

01:34:50.890 --> 01:34:53.390
Forgive me, Moxica.

01:34:54.170 --> 01:34:57.930
But it was your horse
I was talking about.

01:35:12.170 --> 01:35:14.330
Thank you, Moxica.

01:35:30.450 --> 01:35:32.610
Now!

01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:35.930
Heave! Heave!

01:37:24.730 --> 01:37:27.790
My dear sons...

01:37:28.210 --> 01:37:34.170
...in unbearable heat, we are building
the first city of the New World.

01:37:34.330 --> 01:37:37.930
I brought the plans
of a Florentine architect...

01:37:37.970 --> 01:37:41.310
...Leonardo, da Vinci.

01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:46.090
God willing,
we will establish his ideal city.

01:37:47.190 --> 01:37:50.510
We are trying to adapt
to the Indian diet.

01:37:50.530 --> 01:37:54.070
Meat is only a memory for us.

01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:59.410
But in less than a week, the mill
will be ready to produce our first flour.

01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:04.130
Soon, we'll be eating
our own bread.

01:38:04.370 --> 01:38:07.350
Never again
will I underestimate its taste...

01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:10.670
...or the simple comfort of home.

01:38:12.690 --> 01:38:15.630
You are always in my thoughts.

01:38:15.770 --> 01:38:19.410
Forever, your Father.

01:39:11.490 --> 01:39:13.730
You want her?

01:39:16.610 --> 01:39:19.530
Then you can have her.

01:39:20.370 --> 01:39:23.430
To the New World,
my friend.

01:39:31.530 --> 01:39:34.710
To the Governor...

01:39:35.090 --> 01:39:38.170
...of the mosquitos!

01:39:51.850 --> 01:39:54.310
She's a good cook.

01:40:00.690 --> 01:40:03.110
What kind of meat is this?

01:40:04.770 --> 01:40:06.730
Iguana!

01:40:11.050 --> 01:40:12.610
What's wrong with it?
It's an Indian dish.

01:40:12.670 --> 01:40:14.510
Well, I'm not an Indian.

01:40:14.610 --> 01:40:17.690
You know Christopher,
I think Giacomo is right.

01:40:17.730 --> 01:40:19.910
We can't live on corn and pepper.

01:40:20.010 --> 01:40:23.930
The Indians can't take the heavy
plantation work, we need black slaves.

01:40:23.965 --> 01:40:27.290
Besides, everything rots in the
ground before it can be harvested.

01:40:27.370 --> 01:40:31.290
Have you noticed?
The horses and pigs multiply.

01:40:31.370 --> 01:40:35.910
I can't keep them from mounting
each other. May be it's the heat.

01:40:36.010 --> 01:40:40.970
Well, I must confess that the heat
has a similar effect on me.

01:40:45.410 --> 01:40:47.270
You're both right.

01:40:47.410 --> 01:40:50.130
But the fort must be completed
before the rains begin.

01:40:50.190 --> 01:40:53.410
We must rely on our strengths.

01:40:53.570 --> 01:40:55.510
What exactly do you mean?

01:40:55.610 --> 01:40:59.130
Every able man must work!

01:41:00.130 --> 01:41:04.170
All of us!
Including the nobility.

01:41:07.810 --> 01:41:10.710
They're exempt, Christopher!

01:41:11.370 --> 01:41:15.710
Well, now they won't be!

01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:00.490
<i>Next!</i>

01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:02.350
<i>Name?</i>

01:42:32.170 --> 01:42:34.930
- Name?
- Colpa.

01:42:37.650 --> 01:42:39.910
What's he saying?

01:42:39.970 --> 01:42:42.210
He has not found any.

01:42:42.610 --> 01:42:45.530
Why? Ask him why!

01:42:46.530 --> 01:42:49.610
Stop him!
Bring him back!

01:42:54.810 --> 01:42:57.310
He says he hasn't found any.

01:43:10.410 --> 01:43:11.610
He's lying.

01:43:11.645 --> 01:43:12.810
Tell him...

01:43:13.810 --> 01:43:17.790
...to put his hand on the table.
Like this.

01:43:21.930 --> 01:43:23.830
Tell them...

01:43:24.610 --> 01:43:29.030
...I know they are hiding
the gold from us.

01:43:33.650 --> 01:43:35.710
Tell them...

01:43:35.810 --> 01:43:38.810
...this is how we treat
thieves and liars.

01:43:38.850 --> 01:43:41.370
Don Adrian,
you cannot do this thing!

01:43:41.450 --> 01:43:43.970
I can't?

01:43:47.730 --> 01:43:49.490
I can!

01:44:00.410 --> 01:44:05.010
In one act of brutality
you have created chaos.

01:44:05.170 --> 01:44:09.730
All the tribes are now
joining forces against us.

01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:14.190
All of that because of your
criminal savagery.

01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:19.090
Savagery,
is what monkeys understand.

01:44:19.170 --> 01:44:23.530
You should have done the same
a long time ago, Don Cristobal.

01:44:23.570 --> 01:44:27.590
Your ways,
they don't work!

01:44:29.450 --> 01:44:33.190
You'll be held in detention,
deprived of your privileges...

01:44:33.230 --> 01:44:37.150
...until you are sent back to Spain,
where you'll be judged.

01:44:37.230 --> 01:44:40.230
Have anything to say?

01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:54.630
For four years now...

01:44:54.730 --> 01:44:56.550
...we are here.

01:44:56.570 --> 01:45:01.830
We stayed here four years...

01:45:01.890 --> 01:45:04.950
...because we believed
your promises.

01:45:05.410 --> 01:45:12.370
But we find neither gold,
nor your earthly paradise!

01:45:27.010 --> 01:45:30.350
You and your brothers...

01:45:30.450 --> 01:45:33.990
...you have failed...

01:45:34.090 --> 01:45:39.510
...Senor, Colombo!

01:45:58.930 --> 01:46:02.050
- Don Giacomo, you will come at once!
- What's happening?

01:46:02.085 --> 01:46:05.890
In the mine!
Get Don Christopher!

01:47:10.170 --> 01:47:12.490
Cut him down!

01:47:15.570 --> 01:47:18.610
Cut the ropes!
Cut the ropes!

01:47:24.090 --> 01:47:28.930
Moxica's right!
Your ways don't work!

01:47:29.290 --> 01:47:31.630
We have to find them.

01:47:31.850 --> 01:47:33.590
Did you hear me?

01:47:33.690 --> 01:47:35.650
You have to find them!

01:47:35.690 --> 01:47:37.630
You see what they did?

01:47:37.690 --> 01:47:41.490
You did the same
to your God.

01:47:45.650 --> 01:47:47.930
You know them?

01:50:35.670 --> 01:50:37.330
Charge!

01:51:08.370 --> 01:51:10.450
Stop!

01:54:50.090 --> 01:54:51.730
Fire!

01:57:12.290 --> 01:57:14.130
Moxica!

01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:48.470
You know, what will be said
about this in Spain...

01:57:48.490 --> 01:57:50.990
...don't you?

01:58:01.810 --> 01:58:04.630
You are nothing!

01:58:05.410 --> 01:58:12.090
Your bastards
will never inherit your titles, no!

01:58:12.970 --> 01:58:14.690
We...

01:58:15.730 --> 01:58:19.870
...we are everything!

01:58:21.970 --> 01:58:24.970
We are immortal!

01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:55.250
Bastard!

02:00:35.290 --> 02:00:37.850
Don Christopher...

02:00:41.490 --> 02:00:44.070
...I wish to return to Spain.

02:00:44.370 --> 02:00:49.710
I have no desire to remain
in this Godless place.

02:00:49.770 --> 02:00:51.610
They are criminals.

02:00:51.690 --> 02:00:53.190
They have a debt
towards the people of Spain.

02:00:53.191 --> 02:00:56.691
Moxica paid,
they will have to pay too!

02:00:56.710 --> 02:01:00.170
I do not understand you,
Don Christopher.

02:01:00.210 --> 02:01:03.250
You treat Christians equally
with heathen savages.

02:01:03.330 --> 02:01:07.050
And what do you offer
in return?

02:01:08.770 --> 02:01:12.070
A New World, Buyl!

02:01:12.850 --> 02:01:17.090
No one wants one,
only you!

02:01:17.170 --> 02:01:19.610
Not only me!

02:01:19.730 --> 02:01:21.255
Look at these people.

02:01:21.290 --> 02:01:24.850
They could go back to Spain
to see their families.

02:01:24.930 --> 02:01:26.415
But they stay.

02:01:26.450 --> 02:01:31.750
They want something new.
A new world!

02:01:32.850 --> 02:01:37.210
I'll be leaving
on the next ship.

02:01:37.250 --> 02:01:40.910
You may leave if you please,
but...

02:01:41.170 --> 02:01:45.610
...your departure won't help me
make this place more Godly.

02:02:03.010 --> 02:02:07.810
Perhaps hope only exists
in the journey, Giacomo.

02:02:08.610 --> 02:02:10.890
At the beginning,
everything's possible.

02:02:10.930 --> 02:02:14.010
Every expectation,
every dream.

02:02:14.090 --> 02:02:17.910
No one ever expected this
to be easy, Christopher!

02:02:17.970 --> 02:02:21.710
This is not
how I imagined it to be.

02:02:21.810 --> 02:02:25.410
Marchena was right, Bartolome.

02:02:30.610 --> 02:02:34.370
Paradise and Hell
both can be earthly.

02:02:34.450 --> 02:02:38.730
We carry them with us
wherever we go.

02:04:23.950 --> 02:04:25.590
Utopan!

02:04:27.450 --> 02:04:29.110
Speak to me!

02:04:29.290 --> 02:04:32.890
You never learned
how to speak my language.

02:06:59.050 --> 02:07:04.130
Your Majesty, here are the true
facts concerning the island of Hispaniola.

02:07:04.165 --> 02:07:06.270
The activity of your servant
Christopher Columbus...

02:07:06.271 --> 02:07:10.171
...Admiral of the ocean sea
and Governer of that island...

02:07:10.210 --> 02:07:14.090
...the truth he now presides
over a state of chaos...

02:07:14.130 --> 02:07:18.350
...of degradation and madness.

02:07:18.850 --> 02:07:20.870
From the beginning
Colombus proved himself...

02:07:20.871 --> 02:07:24.071
...completely incapable of
managing the affairs of these islands.

02:07:24.090 --> 02:07:28.230
He appointed his brothers
very important positions...

02:07:28.250 --> 02:07:31.610
...and so doing, injuring the pride
and dignity of nobles.

02:07:32.050 --> 02:07:34.070
He, then promised to build a city.

02:07:34.130 --> 02:07:37.010
City of Isabel,
named after Your Majesty.

02:07:37.090 --> 02:07:39.950
A group of huts
all in the wrong place...

02:07:39.985 --> 02:07:43.630
...swept away
by the rains and mud.

02:07:43.770 --> 02:07:47.650
He, then promised gold, evidently
not finding the easy quantities he promised.

02:07:47.730 --> 02:07:53.450
He has since commanded
each Indian to pay a tax...

02:07:53.610 --> 02:07:56.690
...a monthly tribute of gold.

02:07:56.710 --> 02:08:04.210
Most being unable to, we find,
have been punished or massacred.

02:08:06.250 --> 02:08:10.010
Columbus forced nobility
to hard labour...

02:08:10.130 --> 02:08:13.070
...he treated them equally
with Indians.

02:08:13.170 --> 02:08:15.970
He reduced them into his slaves.

02:08:16.050 --> 02:08:20.110
When the noble man Adrian de Moxica
protested against this treatment...

02:08:20.210 --> 02:08:21.850
...he was executed.

02:08:21.870 --> 02:08:25.370
- Is this true, Brother Buyl?
- Yes, Your Excellency.

02:08:25.410 --> 02:08:31.290
These are all true, all of it.
I saw it with my own eyes.

02:08:31.350 --> 02:08:33.090
Well...

02:08:33.170 --> 02:08:36.250
...he promised a Paradise.

02:08:40.290 --> 02:08:43.190
He failed!

02:08:43.210 --> 02:08:48.910
He must be replaced,
immediately!

02:08:50.370 --> 02:08:55.750
And who would you think of
for such a task?

02:08:56.530 --> 02:08:59.390
I am thinking of a man.

02:08:59.570 --> 02:09:02.970
A man devoted to Your Majesties.

02:09:04.410 --> 02:09:07.050
A man extremely motivated.

02:09:45.970 --> 02:09:48.470
Excellency, I'm sorry!

02:09:50.170 --> 02:09:54.230
Don Francisco de Bobadilla.

02:09:54.850 --> 02:09:58.830
Yes, I remember.

02:09:58.890 --> 02:10:02.670
My letters of appointment.

02:10:09.610 --> 02:10:12.550
I am the new Viceroy
of the Indies.

02:10:12.650 --> 02:10:15.090
Congratulations!

02:10:15.890 --> 02:10:19.030
Then I am free to search
for the mainland?

02:10:19.370 --> 02:10:24.710
The mainland was discovered
weeks ago, by another Italian.

02:10:27.850 --> 02:10:31.090
Amerigo Vespucci, Excellency.

02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:43.550
How far?

02:10:43.610 --> 02:10:48.930
I'm not a seaman, but I heard
it's no more than a week at sea.

02:10:50.650 --> 02:10:54.310
I hope you are not
too disappointed.

02:10:56.370 --> 02:10:59.010
How could I be?

02:10:59.890 --> 02:11:05.790
The mainland has been found
exactly as I said it would.

02:11:09.930 --> 02:11:13.950
I'm afraid this isn't
the worst news.

02:11:54.890 --> 02:11:56.650
Diego?

02:11:57.050 --> 02:11:59.070
Father!

02:12:01.090 --> 02:12:05.750
Fernando!
Oh, my God!

02:12:07.610 --> 02:12:09.230
A man!

02:12:09.250 --> 02:12:12.090
How did this happen?

02:12:13.170 --> 02:12:15.830
Diego, Diego!

02:12:23.890 --> 02:12:25.350
Don't worry...

02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:27.150
...we're going
to get you out of here.

02:12:27.250 --> 02:12:29.570
- Santangel's going to see the Queen.
- Good!

02:12:29.770 --> 02:12:31.630
Good, good!

02:12:33.290 --> 02:12:35.510
I'll go back as soon as
they'll free me.

02:12:35.530 --> 02:12:38.150
This time with me.

02:12:38.250 --> 02:12:41.090
In your present state
it is madness, Father.

02:12:41.125 --> 02:12:44.250
Nobody is forcing you
to come with us.

02:12:48.370 --> 02:12:50.230
Diego!

02:12:51.810 --> 02:12:53.650
Oh, Diego!

02:13:52.170 --> 02:13:54.530
Rise, please.

02:14:02.930 --> 02:14:04.610
Now...

02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:08.250
...I do look older than you.

02:14:14.290 --> 02:14:20.110
I have looked for a reason why
I should allow you to go back.

02:14:20.290 --> 02:14:24.270
And though I tried,
I could not find one.

02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:28.030
Help me find one.

02:14:32.010 --> 02:14:37.630
All my life I have dreamed
of reaching the continent.

02:14:37.690 --> 02:14:42.510
I thought my dreams,
grandiose!

02:14:44.490 --> 02:14:50.850
But reality was beyond
my expectations, far beyond.

02:14:53.970 --> 02:14:56.170
And now...

02:14:58.770 --> 02:15:02.530
...I want to explore that land...

02:15:09.330 --> 02:15:12.330
...before I die!

02:15:25.770 --> 02:15:32.470
I allow you
to undertake another voyage.

02:15:32.530 --> 02:15:35.110
Thank you!

02:15:35.530 --> 02:15:38.330
But without your brothers!

02:15:38.530 --> 02:15:43.810
Nor you to return to Santo Domingo
or any of the other colonies.

02:15:44.370 --> 02:15:49.270
The New World
is a disaster.

02:15:54.050 --> 02:15:58.070
And the old one, an achievement?

02:16:33.790 --> 02:16:38.709
I know, I shouldn't tolerate
his impertinence.

02:16:40.530 --> 02:16:42.690
Then why?

02:16:45.330 --> 02:16:48.230
Because he's not afraid of me.

02:16:51.650 --> 02:16:53.110
Sanchez!

02:17:02.930 --> 02:17:04.990
You're a dreamer.

02:17:11.690 --> 02:17:14.230
Look out there.

02:17:17.129 --> 02:17:19.709
What do you see?

02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:27.530
I see towers...

02:17:27.690 --> 02:17:31.450
...I see palaces,
I see steeples...

02:17:31.570 --> 02:17:34.150
...I see civilisation!

02:17:34.730 --> 02:17:38.309
And I see spires that reach...

02:17:38.370 --> 02:17:40.889
...to the sky!

02:17:45.290 --> 02:17:48.670
All of them created
by people like me.

02:17:49.290 --> 02:17:52.030
No matter how long you live,
Sanchez...

02:17:52.570 --> 02:17:56.830
...there's something
that will never change between us.

02:17:57.889 --> 02:18:00.190
I did it...

02:18:01.170 --> 02:18:03.930
...you didn't!

02:19:14.969 --> 02:19:17.230
You're so beautiful!

02:19:25.410 --> 02:19:30.290
I can't believe no other man
has never taken you away from me.

02:19:30.370 --> 02:19:34.469
They tried,
but I didn't let them.

02:19:40.330 --> 02:19:42.910
They took everything.

02:19:43.450 --> 02:19:46.010
Not everything.

02:19:46.889 --> 02:19:49.330
Do you think I care?

02:19:49.970 --> 02:19:52.990
I'm a free man again.

02:19:53.610 --> 02:19:58.430
Riches don't make a man rich,
they only make him busier.

02:20:01.770 --> 02:20:05.910
Oh, God!
How much I've missed you!

02:20:07.790 --> 02:20:12.130
By the Grace of God
and Your Beneficient Majesty!

02:20:12.190 --> 02:20:14.590
A new continent
has now been found...

02:20:14.610 --> 02:20:18.630
...and claimed
in the name of the Spanish Crown...

02:20:18.670 --> 02:20:22.530
...in the year 1492.

02:20:23.530 --> 02:20:28.770
As Your Majesty is well aware,
the University of Salamanca...

02:20:28.810 --> 02:20:32.570
...has always defended the theory...

02:20:32.650 --> 02:20:37.910
...of the existence
of unknown territories to the west.

02:20:39.130 --> 02:20:43.830
The surest route to the new continent
has now been firmly established.

02:20:44.010 --> 02:20:49.610
West by south-west for 750 leagues
to Santo Domingo.

02:20:49.730 --> 02:20:51.190
From there...

02:20:51.210 --> 02:20:55.790
...west-north-west leading
San Juan to the north...

02:20:55.970 --> 02:21:01.130
...reaching the island of Hispaniola
on the northen Cape of San Raphael.

02:21:01.270 --> 02:21:06.930
Then onto the mainland
at Cape Gracias A Dios.

02:21:07.770 --> 02:21:11.370
Spain, by Your Majesty's grace...

02:21:11.410 --> 02:21:18.090
...has now confirmed for all humanity,
the existence of a New World.

02:21:19.010 --> 02:21:23.250
To the unknown lands!

02:21:23.690 --> 02:21:29.650
This continent was first discovered
by a mariner commissioned by Your Majesty.

02:21:29.810 --> 02:21:32.390
His name...

02:21:33.490 --> 02:21:37.890
...Amerigo Vespucci!

02:22:13.530 --> 02:22:15.190
Sanchez!

02:22:25.070 --> 02:22:28.870
What a tragedy.
What a waste of a life.

02:22:29.010 --> 02:22:30.910
A waste?

02:22:31.170 --> 02:22:34.630
Well, if your name or mine
is ever remembered...

02:22:35.970 --> 02:22:39.530
...it will only be because of his!

02:22:56.890 --> 02:22:59.370
It's Diego,
he's is at court with Santangel.

02:22:59.371 --> 02:23:02.971
He says they hope to get your
priveleges restored, maybe the house.

02:23:03.170 --> 02:23:05.610
But how is he?

02:23:05.810 --> 02:23:09.810
Diego is thinking of starting
a pearl trade in Santo Domingo.

02:23:10.410 --> 02:23:13.750
He says he received many letters
for you, mostly from your men.

02:23:13.970 --> 02:23:16.050
He sent some of them.

02:23:18.250 --> 02:23:21.390
- This one's from Mendez.
- Mendez?

02:23:21.490 --> 02:23:23.550
What does he say?

02:23:24.810 --> 02:23:29.070
He asks to come and visit you.
He left his address.

02:23:30.290 --> 02:23:34.690
He never had one.
Except aboard my ships.

02:23:38.930 --> 02:23:42.250
I want you to tell me
everything you remember, Father.

02:23:43.410 --> 02:23:45.810
I wouldn't know
where to start, Fernando.

02:23:45.890 --> 02:23:49.990
Tell me the first thing
that comes to your mind.

02:24:13.930 --> 02:24:17.210
I remember...
