WEBVTT

00:10.051 --> 00:12.762
[Sheldon] Sometimes I feel like
I'm at odds with the whole world.

00:13.680 --> 00:14.639
[man] How so?

00:20.061 --> 00:22.689
Things with Grace are strained.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.733
[Grace] You cannot control everything.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.901
Chloe is out of control.
She blames me for…

00:26.985 --> 00:28.987
I don't know, everything, I guess.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.072
I didn't ask to be your daughter,

00:31.156 --> 00:34.034
and I sure as shit
didn't ask for your gifts.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.326
Brandon killed Blackstar…

00:35.410 --> 00:36.578
[shouting]

00:38.204 --> 00:41.833
…a copy or whatever, and doesn't feel
like he did anything wrong.

00:41.916 --> 00:43.710
Seventy-eight percent
of the country agrees.

00:43.793 --> 00:44.836
[crowd clamoring]

00:44.919 --> 00:47.714
Seventy-eight percent
of the country believes

00:47.797 --> 00:49.841
that the Code I've lived by my whole life

00:50.842 --> 00:52.218
is somehow meaningless.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.261
So…

00:55.513 --> 00:56.723
that about cover it?

00:58.433 --> 01:01.603
[man] So you're having
a relationship with a statistic?

01:02.437 --> 01:03.772
You listed the conflicts you're in

01:03.855 --> 01:06.733
with the three people
who are most important in your life,

01:07.525 --> 01:10.195
and now the one you're in
with a percentage point.

01:10.278 --> 01:12.989
Any thoughts
on why that number means so much to you?

01:13.073 --> 01:15.283
Because what's the use in doing good

01:15.366 --> 01:18.161
if nobody perceives it that way? Huh?

01:20.997 --> 01:23.583
[inhales sharply] Do you remember
when this notion of doing good

01:23.666 --> 01:25.668
became so important in your life?

01:28.922 --> 01:29.756
Look,

01:31.091 --> 01:32.842
a few days after my father died,

01:33.927 --> 01:37.806
I sat on the floor of his bedroom
with a bottle of whiskey.

01:38.306 --> 01:41.392
-This was in '29, just after the Crash?
-Yeah, right after.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.561
-Where did you get the whiskey?
-What does that matter?

01:43.645 --> 01:45.772
[chuckling] Well, you're a good guy.

01:46.314 --> 01:49.400
-Prohibition wasn't repealed until '33.
-[sighs]

01:49.984 --> 01:52.570
[chuckling] Go on.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.538
I was sitting there with Dad's whiskey,

02:01.621 --> 02:04.624
and the article
that Grace had written about him…

02:06.459 --> 02:09.838
taking a swig after every paragraph,
reading about all of the things

02:09.921 --> 02:12.257
that my father did
that I didn't know about.

02:15.593 --> 02:17.178
I decided right then and there

02:17.262 --> 02:22.225
that if nothing was gonna numb
the disappointment and the betrayal…

02:24.269 --> 02:26.271
that I was gonna go
in a different direction.

02:26.354 --> 02:28.648
I was gonna reverse the sins of my father

02:30.108 --> 02:32.402
by being everything that he was not.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.698
By being good.

02:40.410 --> 02:43.913
[Jane] So, Mother and I both agree
the ballroom's perfect.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.540
So I say, "We'll take it."

02:46.541 --> 02:49.794
Then a door in the wall pops open,

02:49.878 --> 02:54.257
and out walks
a tiny little man in a big hat,

02:54.340 --> 02:57.468
insisting on $500 cash
right then and there,

02:57.552 --> 02:59.888
like he's never heard
the country's in a depression.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.807
When I asked why that's necessary,
he says, "'Cause of the hooch."

03:02.891 --> 03:04.684
"You ain't planning
no dry wedding, is you?"

03:04.767 --> 03:07.103
Turns out the Fairmont is run by the mob!

03:07.187 --> 03:08.104
[chuckles]

03:08.188 --> 03:11.441
[farmer echoing] Around and around…

03:12.233 --> 03:13.193
[pants]

03:14.402 --> 03:15.570
What?

03:15.653 --> 03:16.988
[Sheldon] I'm sorry, Jane.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.328
You're home now.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.330
That's all that matters.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.540
[clock ticking]

03:27.624 --> 03:28.791
Was it somebody close?

03:30.126 --> 03:31.044
[Jane] Sheldon?

03:31.586 --> 03:33.254
It's always somebody close.

03:33.338 --> 03:37.217
So, uh… the Fairmont's off the table?

03:37.300 --> 03:40.428
Oh, it's such a gorgeous space.
Miriam was right about that.

03:40.511 --> 03:42.764
You hear that? The ringing?

03:42.847 --> 03:46.100
-Maybe you can talk him down.
-I can't. I have a… a board meeting.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.977
Just call in and take the day off.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.397
-[Chester] You know where to start.
-[farmer] Twenty-eight.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.400
[Chester] You know where to go.
You know where.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.403
-[farmer] Thirty-four.
-[Chester] They're waiting for you.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.947
-[ticking]
-[farmer] Forty-seven.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.990
[Chester] Sheldon, time's running out!

04:01.074 --> 04:02.784
-[farmer] Sixteen.
-Shel?

04:02.867 --> 04:04.953
-[ethereal voices] Find us.
-[Chester] Sheldon!

04:05.036 --> 04:06.496
[ethereal voices] We're waiting.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.830
Waiting.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.041
[Sheldon panting]

04:22.553 --> 04:24.264
[retching]

04:36.943 --> 04:38.611
[ticking]

04:45.576 --> 04:46.494
[Sheldon] Dad's watch?

04:51.332 --> 04:53.584
[dramatic music playing]

05:37.170 --> 05:40.715
[distorted beeping]

05:46.554 --> 05:47.472
[gasps]

05:47.972 --> 05:50.016
[heart monitor beeping]

05:50.641 --> 05:53.644
[woman over PA]
Clinical coordinator, dial extension 5465.

05:54.228 --> 05:57.398
Clinical coordinator, extension 5465.

06:00.276 --> 06:02.570
You took something
that doesn't belong to you.

06:05.865 --> 06:08.368
And what are you gonna do about it,
asshole?

06:08.451 --> 06:09.535
[menacing music playing]

06:09.619 --> 06:10.870
[chuckles]

06:12.663 --> 06:15.917
[grunting]

06:29.514 --> 06:32.225
Hey. What happened?
The tractor conk out again?

06:32.308 --> 06:33.142
Hey.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.645
No, I just wanted to get my hands dirty.

06:36.145 --> 06:37.188
Where you been?

06:37.271 --> 06:39.232
Volcano erupted in Nusa Tenggara.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.609
I cleared the villagers out,
diverted the lava to the ocean.

06:41.692 --> 06:43.528
-Oh. [grunting]
-Yeah.

06:43.611 --> 06:46.114
I got some great pictures. You wanna see?

06:46.197 --> 06:49.158
Yeah, I'd love to see 'em.
Just let me finish the back forty here.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.869
Well, why don't I just get
Brandon down to help?

06:51.953 --> 06:52.829
He's not here.

06:53.329 --> 06:54.414
He on patrol?

06:54.497 --> 06:57.500
I sent him to the Union
to see Blackstar's autopsy.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.377
Oh. Did you?

07:00.002 --> 07:01.462
[panting]

07:03.464 --> 07:04.799
He needs to see it, Grace.

07:04.882 --> 07:10.930
Well, Sheldon, you actually don't get
to make that decision by yourself.

07:11.013 --> 07:11.931
You weren't here.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.516
That's bullshit.

07:14.392 --> 07:17.270
Look, he needs to see that
there are consequences to his actions.

07:17.353 --> 07:20.148
This isn't a lesson. This is a punishment.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.191
Since when
are those two things mutually exclusive?

07:22.275 --> 07:27.280
Sheldon, he already knows
that he screwed up and he let you down.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.073
He let the Utopian down.

07:29.782 --> 07:30.825
I just don't understand

07:30.908 --> 07:33.161
how rubbing his nose in it
is gonna make it better.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.704
He's not a puppy, okay?

07:34.787 --> 07:38.291
He needs to learn
about responsibility and accountability.

07:39.709 --> 07:40.835
We're not just raising a son.

07:40.918 --> 07:43.004
Yeah, well,
we're also raising a human being.

07:43.504 --> 07:46.632
[sighs] Sometimes, I… I just… [chuckles]

07:46.716 --> 07:48.384
I think that, uh, you forget

07:48.468 --> 07:52.013
that those two things
aren't mutually exclusive.

07:54.891 --> 07:55.892
[panting]

08:06.152 --> 08:09.947
[sighs] Dickhead was supposed
to be here an hour ago.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.574
Yeah, he's always late.

08:12.950 --> 08:14.494
Likes to make an entrance.

08:17.705 --> 08:18.998
How you holding up?

08:19.081 --> 08:22.210
I wish everyone would stop asking me
that question. I'm fine.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.754
Your tone indicates otherwise.

08:24.837 --> 08:25.713
[Brandon scoffs]

08:28.758 --> 08:30.092
I keep on playing the battle…

08:30.176 --> 08:31.844
-[grunts]
-[gasps]

08:31.928 --> 08:35.932
…over and over in my head,
and every time, it's getting less clear.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.600
[Blackstar grunting]

08:38.226 --> 08:40.102
[Brandon]
What would you have done, Uncle Walt?

08:41.729 --> 08:43.105
I'm not as strong as you

08:44.315 --> 08:46.359
or your dad. No one is.

08:46.442 --> 08:47.860
That's not an answer.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.779
Yeah, 'cause honestly,

08:51.447 --> 08:52.448
I don't have one.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.035
All I know is we're here.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.372
You made a decision. We're here.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.124
Nothing can change that.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.168
[ethereal tinkling]

09:11.926 --> 09:12.760
Told you.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.313
Brandon!

09:24.855 --> 09:27.817
Haven't seen you
since you were a… a wee lad.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.779
-Mr. Wolfe.
-Ah! Barnabas, please.

09:31.862 --> 09:33.030
We're practically family.

09:33.114 --> 09:36.617
[chuckles] If your mother had any sense,
you'd be calling me Daddy.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.829
Can we just skip being an asshole?
Get to it, Barnabas.

09:39.912 --> 09:43.249
[sighs] Don't make me turn your clothes
to steam, Walter.

09:43.332 --> 09:46.377
Nobody needs to see
your sad little Schwanz.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.045
[kisses]

09:49.171 --> 09:50.715
Hello, lovelies!

09:51.966 --> 09:53.801
Please, don't stand up.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.679
Fitz, get us started.

09:56.762 --> 10:00.182
Okay. The armor's identical
to the original Blackstar's.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.393
It's fused with this underlying tissue,

10:02.476 --> 10:04.437
making it impossible to remove
without destroying--

10:04.520 --> 10:08.983
Yes, yes. This is very difficult
and far beyond your meager abilities.

10:09.483 --> 10:12.236
Everyone, please stand back

10:13.112 --> 10:16.240
unless you're keen on having
your reproductive organs irradiated.

10:16.824 --> 10:17.908
[grunts]

10:37.261 --> 10:39.972
-You're gonna tear the tissue.
-Do be quiet.

10:40.556 --> 10:43.809
This is a tad more difficult
than being a human light bulb.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.366
Mmm.

11:00.993 --> 11:04.830
Large intestine, 7,200 grams.
Jesus! He's a big mother.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.916
That's just settling in, is it?

11:08.042 --> 11:09.335
Help me loosen the liver.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.423
[coughing]

11:14.965 --> 11:16.967
-Why don't you wait outside?
-I'm good.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.512
If you're going to be unwell,
please direct it away from me.

11:19.595 --> 11:21.430
I can only manipulate inorganic matter.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.891
And this coat is Italian cashmere.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.227
Wait. You're hitting something.

11:30.439 --> 11:31.357
[grunts]

11:37.822 --> 11:39.156
What the hell is that?

11:39.949 --> 11:40.783
Barnabas?

11:40.866 --> 11:41.992
One moment.

11:43.035 --> 11:43.869
Hmm.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.205
[chuckles]

11:47.707 --> 11:48.541
[grunts]

11:49.083 --> 11:51.210
Ah, that's interesting.

11:52.461 --> 11:55.172
Oh, now, that's different.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.966
Just tell us what we're looking at.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.384
Wait.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.053
There's something else.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.181
Something inside.

12:06.642 --> 12:07.977
Ah.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.320
[clock winding]

12:21.198 --> 12:22.366
[Cuthbert] Mr. Sampson?

12:23.117 --> 12:24.034
Yes.

12:24.118 --> 12:26.871
He is waiting for you
in the master suite, sir.

12:26.954 --> 12:28.789
Oh. Well, thank you, Cuthbert.

12:31.041 --> 12:34.253
You were right, George.
The farmhouse, it's all real.

12:34.336 --> 12:36.547
This, it was written
on the family's table in the cellar.

12:36.630 --> 12:37.923
It's longitude and latitude.

12:38.007 --> 12:41.051
It's the Atlantic Ocean.
There's something out there, George.

12:41.677 --> 12:43.763
That's what I think all of this is about.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.223
[sighs]

12:46.849 --> 12:50.102
[Sheldon] The farmer's family was sitting
down there, sitting around an old table.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.313
-And when I saw them--
-What were they doing down there?

12:52.396 --> 12:53.439
What?

12:53.522 --> 12:55.608
The… the family, you said
the family was in the cellar.

12:55.691 --> 12:57.401
What were they doing down in…?

12:57.943 --> 12:59.028
Oh, they…

12:59.111 --> 13:02.114
The farmer had shot them
long before I got there. And then…

13:03.699 --> 13:06.327
he turned the gun on himself
right in front of me.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.831
This is real, George. I'm not crazy.

13:10.915 --> 13:11.999
Something's…

13:12.082 --> 13:12.958
I don't know.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.628
…calling to me, to all of us.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.173
-All of us?
-[Sheldon] Yes.

13:19.256 --> 13:21.091
The farmer's dead family,

13:21.175 --> 13:23.093
suddenly, they weren't there anymore.

13:25.429 --> 13:28.390
And sitting around the table
was… was Walt,

13:29.016 --> 13:32.019
a… a… a… a kid from the… the mill,

13:32.102 --> 13:35.564
the woman reporter from… from…
that wrote the article about Dad.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.526
There were a couple of other men
that I didn't recognize.

13:38.609 --> 13:41.028
One of them might've been
a captain of a ship.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.655
The other one, I don't… I don't know.

13:42.738 --> 13:45.074
But then there was you, George.
You were there.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.035
-And we were dead?
-No.

13:48.118 --> 13:50.329
But we were sitting
in the same place as the dead people.

13:50.412 --> 13:52.957
-I know how this sounds--
-[chuckles] I don't know if you do, Shel.

13:53.040 --> 13:57.837
Look, the visions, the patterns,
everything that I've been seeing,

13:57.920 --> 14:01.298
I think that it's all part of some kind
of a puzzle, some kind of a test.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.301
And it's all leading to this.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.557
What do you think is out there
in the middle of the ocean?

14:09.640 --> 14:11.517
I don't know, George,
but it's something special,

14:11.600 --> 14:13.644
something that's gonna change the world.

14:13.727 --> 14:14.854
I can feel it.

14:18.315 --> 14:19.525
Will you help me?

14:21.735 --> 14:22.653
[sighs]

14:24.196 --> 14:25.114
[chuckles]

14:26.282 --> 14:27.950
How long have we been friends?

14:29.577 --> 14:31.203
It feels like forever.

14:33.998 --> 14:37.376
What would you do
if I came to you with a story like this?

14:39.169 --> 14:40.921
[Sheldon] Well, I'd wanna believe you,

14:41.422 --> 14:44.425
because you're my friend,
and you always will be.

14:44.508 --> 14:45.509
[chuckles softly]

14:49.889 --> 14:51.140
Then there's your answer.

14:51.932 --> 14:52.766
[chuckles]

14:56.145 --> 14:57.730
[man] Tell me about your dream.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.024
Is it always the same?

15:03.277 --> 15:04.570
More or less, yeah.

15:07.489 --> 15:09.158
I stumble up onto the roof…

15:11.368 --> 15:14.288
like I'm lost
and just accidentally end up there.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.041
And I see him…

15:19.084 --> 15:19.919
in rags,

15:20.002 --> 15:22.922
like he… he doesn't know
where his next meal's coming from.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.383
He turns and looks at me…

15:31.138 --> 15:32.056
and…

15:33.891 --> 15:36.602
[inhales deeply]
…there's no recognition in his eyes.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.312
It feels like he doesn't know who I am.

15:38.395 --> 15:41.482
And I'm like,
"Dad, it's me. It's Sheldon."

15:42.066 --> 15:46.153
But it doesn't register. "Dad, it's me.
Dad, it's me. It's Sheldon."

15:46.236 --> 15:49.740
Then he turns around, and he walks away
right off the edge of the building.

15:50.532 --> 15:53.285
[Sheldon echoing] No! Don't, Dad!

15:54.620 --> 15:56.121
[man] Do you try to stop him?

15:56.205 --> 15:57.498
[yelling echoes]

15:57.581 --> 15:58.415
Yeah.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.250
Every time.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.671
But I'm never fast enough.

16:03.754 --> 16:04.630
[man] Hmm.

16:06.131 --> 16:09.802
Parents aren't supposed to abandon
their children of their own free will.

16:09.885 --> 16:12.054
It defies the natural order. When they do,

16:12.137 --> 16:15.724
a child's mind can only make sense of it
in one way,

16:16.809 --> 16:19.770
that the child did something bad
to deserve it,

16:21.105 --> 16:23.732
that they failed to prevent it.

16:27.027 --> 16:31.490
However, it does help us better understand
your attachment to the Code.

16:32.783 --> 16:35.035
It's operating on several levels for you.

16:35.577 --> 16:38.038
Yes, it has institutionalized
a way to be good.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.249
It's also quite practical,

16:40.332 --> 16:43.711
as it staves off the amount
of death or loss in your life.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.462
But in your line of work,

16:45.546 --> 16:47.548
there is a 100 percent certainty

16:48.340 --> 16:52.761
that your adversaries will attempt
to rob you of your life.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.973
Well, we can agree on that, yes?

16:56.557 --> 16:58.767
-Oh, yeah, Jack.
-[Jack chuckles]

16:59.268 --> 17:00.477
I think you know we can.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.021
[chuckles] Good.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.189
Now, in any other similar field,

17:04.273 --> 17:06.775
the military
or… or law enforcement, for example,

17:06.859 --> 17:10.988
one has the right to kill in self-defense
or in the protection of others.

17:11.613 --> 17:12.448
Yeah.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.200
[Jack] But for the members
of your Union of Justice,

17:15.284 --> 17:19.121
when they… [chuckles]
…are faced with the equivalent threat,

17:20.164 --> 17:23.167
they must remember the Code,

17:24.918 --> 17:27.046
which is another way of remembering you.

17:27.129 --> 17:29.256
We do not let our anger
get the best of us.

17:32.176 --> 17:35.429
So I'm just a giant narcissist?
Is that what you're saying?

17:35.512 --> 17:37.806
No, no, no.
You're just hoping to stay alive

17:37.890 --> 17:39.808
in the minds of the people you love,

17:40.684 --> 17:42.394
the way your father couldn't.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.491
[sighs]

18:15.010 --> 18:16.303
They're exactly the same.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.515
Identical in every way.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.141
How is that even possible?

18:22.559 --> 18:25.813
Well, I can read minds.
You shoot fire out of your eyes.

18:25.896 --> 18:26.939
So, there's that.

18:29.399 --> 18:30.776
And what about this thing?

18:32.194 --> 18:33.821
How did that get inside of him?

18:34.655 --> 18:35.489
No idea.

18:36.698 --> 18:41.954
But the way it's constructed,
the tech, the design…

18:43.288 --> 18:45.374
only one man on the planet
could've built it,

18:47.543 --> 18:48.544
George.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.842
-Skyfox.
-[Walter] Mm-hmm.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.595
Why would George wanna kill us now,
after all these years?

18:58.679 --> 19:03.934
And why hide all of this stuff
inside a copy of Blackstar?

19:04.017 --> 19:05.686
None of it makes any sense.

19:07.062 --> 19:09.815
George always liked puzzles

19:11.358 --> 19:13.152
and a good joke at my expense.

19:14.653 --> 19:15.737
[sighs]

19:15.821 --> 19:19.491
I'm sure he loves being the only one
who knows the punch line here.

19:19.575 --> 19:20.951
Well, it's not like we can ask him.

19:21.034 --> 19:23.370
We spent years looking for him
and never got close.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.667
Maybe there's someone who can help us.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.587
[siren blaring]

19:33.005 --> 19:34.631
-You sure it's there?
-[rumbling]

19:34.715 --> 19:35.716
-[crashing]
-[grunts]

19:37.092 --> 19:38.260
[speaks Chinese]

19:40.053 --> 19:40.929
[laughs]

19:41.430 --> 19:42.556
We need to talk.

19:42.639 --> 19:43.724
Iowa.

20:03.118 --> 20:04.036
[groans]

20:17.883 --> 20:19.218
Home.

20:19.301 --> 20:20.802
-[chiming]
-Home.

20:31.813 --> 20:33.190
I said we need to talk.

20:37.527 --> 20:39.029
It's about your father.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.369
[indistinct chattering]

20:52.417 --> 20:54.503
[phone ringing]

20:55.128 --> 20:57.589
[George] Okay. All I see are trousers.
Where is this gal?

20:57.673 --> 20:59.633
[Sheldon]
Ah, she's here somewhere. I don't know.

21:00.592 --> 21:03.220
Excuse me. We're looking
for Grace Kennedy. Have you seen her?

21:03.303 --> 21:05.681
Oh, I know shit when I smell it, Larry!

21:05.764 --> 21:07.849
Don't wave it under my nose
and call it a bouquet!

21:07.933 --> 21:10.352
-Come on, Grace. Be reasonable.
-Oh, "Come on, Grace."

21:10.435 --> 21:12.437
Shove it up your ass, Larry,

21:12.521 --> 21:14.606
and don't stop
until the shit hits your brain

21:14.690 --> 21:16.858
if there's room for any more up there!

21:16.942 --> 21:17.859
[sighs]

21:18.735 --> 21:20.654
Oh, what are you eyeballing, chipmunk?

21:22.656 --> 21:24.533
[sighing]

21:25.492 --> 21:29.413
Great. If you're here to sue me
for everything I've got, this is it.

21:29.496 --> 21:31.999
No. No, no.
We're not here for that, Miss Kennedy.

21:32.082 --> 21:35.961
Grace. I like to drop the formalities
after someone's read me the riot act.

21:36.044 --> 21:39.214
And I'm sorry about the way I behaved
the last time I was here. It's just…

21:39.881 --> 21:43.135
I didn't know some of those things
about my father, and… and…

21:43.218 --> 21:46.680
Look, I probably would've done
the same, only less politely.

21:50.517 --> 21:52.144
Does this one talk,
or is he just for show?

21:52.227 --> 21:54.688
-Yeah, this is my--
-Oh! Oh, he talks, yeah. George Hutchence.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.356
Oh, yeah.

21:57.024 --> 21:59.651
-I've seen you in the society pages.
-[George] Mm. [clicks tongue]

21:59.735 --> 22:02.487
-You look better in black and white.
-[feigns laughter] I like her.

22:02.571 --> 22:06.199
Well, get a good look, fellas,
'cause she's out the door.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.826
Wait. You quit?

22:08.410 --> 22:09.536
That's one version.

22:09.619 --> 22:13.540
The other is hard times
aren't just for capitalists,

22:14.291 --> 22:18.128
so they had to cut the staff by one,
because I'm a dame in a skirt

22:18.211 --> 22:20.464
and not some sap
with a penis to swing around.

22:21.256 --> 22:22.299
-Debatable.
-[groans]

22:22.382 --> 22:23.925
Where's my mug? [sighs]

22:24.009 --> 22:25.719
Miss Kennedy,
if you could give us a moment--

22:25.802 --> 22:26.636
Where's my mug?

22:26.720 --> 22:28.889
[Sheldon] If you don't mind,
I have an opportunity--

22:28.972 --> 22:29.806
[Grace] Okay! Okay!

22:29.890 --> 22:33.393
-[George] She's… she's on the table.
-Okay! Who's got my mug?

22:36.438 --> 22:38.648
[sighs] Oh, Izzy.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.067
[yells]

22:42.235 --> 22:46.031
-Are you sure about this?
-Yes, yes, yes. She was in the cellar--

22:46.114 --> 22:48.992
That's a better place for her.
Less chance she can gnaw off your leg.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.370
You two planting roots,
or you got something on your mind?

22:53.538 --> 22:55.040
I'd like to offer you a job.

22:56.124 --> 22:58.335
-Me?
-[laughs] I had the same reaction.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.838
I'm mounting an expedition,

23:01.922 --> 23:04.674
and I would like you to come along
to chronicle everything that happens.

23:04.758 --> 23:05.842
An expedition to where?

23:05.926 --> 23:08.095
-Well, it's--
-[scoffs] What does it matter?

23:08.595 --> 23:10.514
Unemployment's heading north
of 20 percent.

23:10.597 --> 23:12.224
Even if you land soft at another paper,

23:12.307 --> 23:15.060
they're not gonna give
the best assignments to a skirt and heels.

23:15.143 --> 23:19.106
So, you throw in with us, you get paid,
and you get the scoop of a lifetime.

23:19.189 --> 23:21.191
Why don't you let Larry choke that down?

23:22.192 --> 23:25.070
You know, if you talk any faster,
your tongue's gonna land on the floor.

23:28.156 --> 23:28.990
Why me?

23:30.951 --> 23:32.911
-It's complicated.
-Dumb it down.

23:34.037 --> 23:37.457
-I had a vision, and you--
-Of a better future.

23:38.625 --> 23:42.003
For you, for the country,
for everyone, really.

23:42.087 --> 23:42.921
-Right.
-Yeah.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.425
So, what's it gonna be?
You gonna stand there with your trash can,

23:46.508 --> 23:51.513
or you gonna show these men
what a gal like you can really do?

23:51.596 --> 23:52.431
[Sheldon] Mmm.

23:59.938 --> 24:01.148
[sighs]

24:03.066 --> 24:04.067
[sighs]

24:07.362 --> 24:08.572
[chuckles] Hey.

24:10.365 --> 24:12.033
[Grace] Brought you a sandwich.

24:12.117 --> 24:14.327
Thanks. Not really hungry.

24:15.078 --> 24:16.455
[Grace] Are you sure?

24:16.997 --> 24:17.873
I'm fine.

24:27.924 --> 24:29.176
Why are you still here?

24:31.761 --> 24:34.431
Been thinking about it… a lot.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.351
What it would be like if that were Dad,

24:39.478 --> 24:40.395
or Uncle Walt,

24:41.771 --> 24:42.606
or you.

24:45.525 --> 24:47.068
How would that be better, Mom?

24:49.905 --> 24:51.406
I mean… [scoffs]

24:53.950 --> 24:54.951
…it wouldn't.

24:58.371 --> 24:59.831
Not for us, it wouldn't.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.209
[door whirs open]

25:05.587 --> 25:06.838
Grace!

25:08.381 --> 25:11.259
Oh, I was hoping
we might run into each other.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.428
[sighs] Hello, Barnabas.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.555
Oh, you're looking as fetching as ever.

25:16.097 --> 25:20.727
Though, I have to say,
I have always preferred you in red.

25:20.810 --> 25:22.395
-Mmm.
-[tinkling]

25:22.479 --> 25:23.647
[Barnabas chuckles]

25:23.730 --> 25:27.192
[gasps, chuckles] Barnabas…

25:27.275 --> 25:28.401
Mm-hmm?

25:28.485 --> 25:29.694
You're lucky I like red.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.488
-[Barnabas] Mmm.
-[chuckles]

25:31.571 --> 25:36.117
Well, I think we're done here.
The Union thanks you for your assistance.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.994
-I think you know your way out.
-Uh…

25:38.078 --> 25:41.122
Actually, Walter's invited me to stay.

25:42.582 --> 25:43.416
[Grace] Has he?

25:44.793 --> 25:47.462
There's a chance
I can get inside Blackstar's mind,

25:48.004 --> 25:49.172
search his memories.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.090
How? He's dead.

25:50.173 --> 25:53.969
I might be able to reanimate parts
of his hippocampus and cortex

25:54.052 --> 25:56.054
if Barnabas can reconstruct
the affected regions.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.349
Translation: You need me.

25:59.432 --> 26:00.892
-[chuckles]
-[sighs]

26:00.976 --> 26:01.851
[Barnabas] Mmm.

26:09.859 --> 26:12.320
Looking right past us,
like we weren't even there.

26:12.821 --> 26:13.780
How's that right?

26:15.407 --> 26:20.078
Well, we'll find something.
It's gonna take some time.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.082
Time's not gonna change the color
of the man handing out the jobs.

26:24.165 --> 26:25.000
[Willie chuckles]

26:26.084 --> 26:27.961
That should be good. Thank you.

26:28.461 --> 26:30.171
The hell you doing here?

26:30.255 --> 26:32.799
These are guests, boy!
You treat 'em like it.

26:32.882 --> 26:35.677
-It's okay, Mrs. Small. It--
-Not in my house, it isn't.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.638
Birdie, can we have a minute, please?

26:40.265 --> 26:41.725
I'll put on some more tea.

26:43.184 --> 26:45.312
[whispers] Mind your manners, both of you.

26:51.693 --> 26:52.527
Boy's right.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.864
What the hell are you doing here?

26:57.032 --> 26:57.949
[George clears throat]

26:58.033 --> 27:00.660
-You found any work?
-We be staring at you if we had?

27:00.744 --> 27:03.163
Okay, let's all just take a moment, huh?

27:03.246 --> 27:04.456
[Willie] I don't know you.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.667
So you wanna take a moment,
why don't you go outside for it?

27:07.751 --> 27:10.295
Now, whoa. This is not about me.
This is about your son.

27:10.378 --> 27:12.881
-Me?
-He in trouble?

27:12.964 --> 27:15.717
No. No, no, no, no.
Not in trouble. It's an opportunity.

27:16.468 --> 27:19.137
-I'd like you to be a part of it, Fitz.
-A part of what?

27:19.846 --> 27:23.516
An expedition. We're gonna secure
a… a boat and a crew in Morocco.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.352
-Morocco?
-Just hear us out.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.312
I don't know anything about the ocean,

27:27.395 --> 27:29.606
and I don't need any favors, Mr. Sampson.

27:29.689 --> 27:32.067
Listen, you would be doing me a favor.
I need…

27:33.735 --> 27:36.154
I need people that I can count on.

27:36.237 --> 27:38.865
And where would you be going
once you leave Morocco?

27:39.574 --> 27:40.533
Well, it's--

27:40.617 --> 27:41.993
-We can't tell you that.
-Why not?

27:45.580 --> 27:48.208
Because then everybody
would be trying to beat us there.

27:48.291 --> 27:50.418
[scoffs] I'm not going anywhere.

27:50.502 --> 27:55.423
I'll pay you. Six months.
Whatever you would've made at the mill.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.176
Yeah. Plus, whatever we find
where we're going,

27:58.259 --> 28:00.470
it'll be a fair split,
right down the line.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.682
Uh, yeah, a fair split.

28:07.769 --> 28:08.728
Is it dangerous?

28:08.812 --> 28:11.147
-No.
-Maybe. No. Yeah. Well, maybe.

28:11.231 --> 28:12.065
A little bit.

28:13.149 --> 28:14.776
But when we find what we're looking for,

28:14.859 --> 28:18.697
we're gonna be able to hire everybody
back from the mill, including your dad.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.116
What do you say?

28:21.658 --> 28:23.076
Chance of a lifetime. Come on.

28:30.458 --> 28:31.292
[sighs]

28:32.460 --> 28:33.586
Come on.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.383
My family needs me right here.
You know where the door is.

28:38.466 --> 28:41.219
-No, no, no. Fitz, you don't understand.
-I don't think-- Don't.

28:41.302 --> 28:43.388
-You heard the boy.
-Okay. Shel…

28:43.471 --> 28:45.974
-It's the chance of a lifetime. Just--
-Okay. Come on, Shel.

28:46.057 --> 28:48.143
-Just get out of here!
-[George] Come on. Let's go.

28:52.355 --> 28:54.858
-[train whistle blowing]
-[indistinct chattering]

29:11.166 --> 29:13.585
Coming in here like that
after what he did to us.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.712
[Willie] Yeah. He's got some nerve,

29:15.795 --> 29:19.424
coming in here and offering you
the chance of a lifetime.

29:23.386 --> 29:24.888
Didn't you just kick 'em out?

29:24.971 --> 29:27.557
[Willie] You don't air your dirty drawers
in front of company.

29:27.640 --> 29:31.227
And anybody
who walks through that door is company,

29:31.311 --> 29:32.854
just like your mama said.

29:33.646 --> 29:36.524
You want me to crawl back to the same man
who stole everything from us?

29:36.608 --> 29:38.943
It was his father
who did all the stealing.

29:40.069 --> 29:42.071
And it's his son
trying to make things right.

29:42.155 --> 29:43.156
[sighs]

29:43.823 --> 29:45.450
I can't believe you want me to do this.

29:45.533 --> 29:47.243
I want you to think, son,

29:48.369 --> 29:52.582
and not with your guts
all twisted up inside.

29:54.417 --> 29:58.171
I want you to think with your… your head,
like your mama and I taught you.

29:59.339 --> 30:01.257
There's nothing here for you, son.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.928
-There's no work. There's no--
-You said we'd find something.

30:05.011 --> 30:06.513
What else am I gonna tell you?

30:07.680 --> 30:11.017
It was bad enough
when the country was on its feet,

30:11.100 --> 30:13.061
but now all a Black man can hope to get

30:13.144 --> 30:15.980
is kicked in the teeth
for wanting an honest day's work.

30:17.482 --> 30:18.399
[sighs]

30:24.531 --> 30:25.865
[Sheldon] We gotta go back in.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.743
-We gotta tell him the truth.
-[scoffs]

30:29.536 --> 30:32.914
You think that'll help?
Be fitting us both for a white coat.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.375
We need him, George.

30:35.458 --> 30:36.835
[clock ticking]

30:36.918 --> 30:41.130
If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.
Otherwise, what's the use, huh?

30:42.423 --> 30:44.509
[ticking intensifies]

30:44.592 --> 30:45.760
[knocking on window]

30:46.845 --> 30:47.762
I'll do it.

30:48.263 --> 30:50.431
-But I want my pay up front.
-Okay.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.892
[Fitz] For my family,
in case anything happens.

30:52.976 --> 30:56.062
Uh… everything's gonna be all right, Fitz.
I promise you.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.022
Up front, all of it.

31:06.239 --> 31:09.492
Well, what do you know, hmm?

31:11.536 --> 31:13.830
Maybe you're not daft in the head
after all.

31:14.706 --> 31:15.623
All right.

31:16.457 --> 31:17.792
[car engine starts]

31:22.839 --> 31:23.840
Thank you, ma'am.

31:23.923 --> 31:25.216
[indistinct chattering]

31:25.300 --> 31:27.594
[country music playing]

31:29.846 --> 31:30.722
So…

31:32.682 --> 31:34.809
I haven't seen my father since I was 12.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.686
-You sure about that?
-[Hutch] Yeah.

31:37.437 --> 31:38.271
Believe me.

31:38.771 --> 31:39.898
[Sheldon] Believe you?

31:39.981 --> 31:43.276
Why would I believe you?
You're not exactly a model citizen.

31:45.778 --> 31:48.281
My dad left
before I could barely wipe my own ass.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.618
So whatever it is you think I am,

31:52.869 --> 31:54.495
it's got nothing to do with him.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.877
You're not the only one he hurt, you know?

32:02.170 --> 32:03.588
-He was my friend.
-Hmm.

32:03.671 --> 32:05.924
-[Sheldon] More than that. He was family.
-[scoffs]

32:06.758 --> 32:08.843
I never thought that he would turn on us.

32:11.721 --> 32:15.224
Way my mom tells it,
you were the ones turned on him.

32:17.560 --> 32:18.394
Yeah?

32:19.604 --> 32:20.605
Mm-hmm.

32:22.398 --> 32:25.568
Well, we all see the world
the way we want it to--

32:25.652 --> 32:27.028
I see it the way it is.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.369
I need to talk to him

32:35.370 --> 32:37.372
before this thing
gets any more out of control.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.582
I already told you,
I don't know where he is.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.417
Yeah? Well, maybe that thing does.

32:42.418 --> 32:44.337
Oh, you think I haven't thought of that?

32:49.968 --> 32:50.843
Humor me.

32:58.476 --> 32:59.560
Take us to my dad.

33:02.689 --> 33:05.024
-[indistinct chattering]
-[dance music playing]

33:06.567 --> 33:08.569
[woman speaking indistinctly]

33:16.327 --> 33:18.663
-He's not here, is he?
-[Hutch] Told you.

33:20.748 --> 33:23.793
-[Sheldon] Some kind of a joke?
-Yeah, a big one.

33:24.585 --> 33:29.257
Every time I tell it to take me to my dad,
it dumps me in another strip club.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.592
He must've thought
that was a real goddamn riot.

33:31.676 --> 33:34.095
-You watch your language, son.
-I'm not your son.

33:34.178 --> 33:36.180
And I am not my damn father.

33:36.264 --> 33:37.598
I've looked the other way with you

33:37.682 --> 33:39.892
out of respect
for who your father used to be.

33:40.393 --> 33:42.270
He reaches out, you best let me know.

33:57.910 --> 34:00.455
I needed you, Shel, here…

34:00.538 --> 34:01.456
Hmm.

34:01.539 --> 34:03.833
…with me to… to make them…

34:04.500 --> 34:05.960
to make them see it my way.

34:07.670 --> 34:10.298
What do you do?
You go running off with your pal.

34:10.381 --> 34:11.799
-You have to understand--
-It's over.

34:12.633 --> 34:15.136
You didn't show. They voted us out.

34:15.928 --> 34:16.888
[sighs]

34:17.805 --> 34:20.516
They're selling the company,
pennies on the dollar.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.396
-We're lucky if we keep the house.
-[panting]

34:28.524 --> 34:29.358
It doesn't matter.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.820
-[Walter] Shel--
-The company, board, none of it matters.

34:32.904 --> 34:35.073
-Can we have the room?
-Yeah.

34:35.156 --> 34:36.407
-Please.
-I'll be outside.

34:39.494 --> 34:41.662
[Sheldon] Walt, I know
you're upset with me.

34:42.580 --> 34:45.166
But I need you to listen to me
for a moment, okay?

34:46.959 --> 34:49.253
Okay. Talk.

34:51.798 --> 34:53.549
I… I had another episode

34:54.092 --> 34:55.635
when I was in Kansas.

34:57.386 --> 34:59.138
But I saw something there.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.182
I saw…

35:02.600 --> 35:06.145
I saw coordinates,
out in the middle of the Atlantic.

35:06.229 --> 35:07.730
-Coordinates?
-[Sheldon] Yeah.

35:08.439 --> 35:09.273
To what?

35:10.858 --> 35:15.154
I don't know. I don't know.
But there is something out there.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.657
There's something
that is gonna change our lives.

35:18.157 --> 35:19.534
Hmm. [chuckles wryly]

35:20.243 --> 35:22.161
-Our lives?
-Yes.

35:23.162 --> 35:25.373
And I want you to come with me.
Please, I'm…

35:27.416 --> 35:28.417
I need you.

35:30.503 --> 35:31.337
[chuckles]

35:32.922 --> 35:33.965
How does that feel,

35:35.383 --> 35:36.467
needing your brother?

35:36.551 --> 35:38.094
Oh, come on. You're not listening to me.

35:38.177 --> 35:41.556
I asked you for one thing, Shel,
that you be here today.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.558
-I needed you--
-It doesn't matter!

35:43.641 --> 35:44.559
[panting]

35:46.978 --> 35:48.146
None of it matters.

35:50.898 --> 35:52.275
[panting]

35:54.318 --> 35:55.444
It mattered to me.

36:05.955 --> 36:08.082
[electronic music playing]

36:09.333 --> 36:10.459
[grunts]

36:11.043 --> 36:12.003
[panting]

36:12.670 --> 36:13.504
[moaning]

36:15.631 --> 36:17.300
[panting]

36:20.845 --> 36:22.096
[moaning]

36:30.813 --> 36:33.024
[both panting]

36:36.068 --> 36:37.904
[laughing]
Are you sure you don't have powers?

36:37.987 --> 36:39.363
[both panting]

36:39.447 --> 36:42.158
Gonna have the bruises tomorrow
to prove it. [chuckles]

36:43.326 --> 36:44.202
[laughs] Sorry.

36:48.915 --> 36:50.750
Your dad dropped in on me today.

36:54.754 --> 36:55.922
Shit.

36:58.549 --> 36:59.967
-What are you doing?
-[gasps]

37:00.468 --> 37:02.803
-This is how it always starts, you know?
-Hey…

37:02.887 --> 37:07.266
Friendly talk, and then, bit by bit,
he will intimidate the shit out of you

37:07.350 --> 37:09.101
until you realize it just…

37:10.853 --> 37:11.687
isn't worth it.

37:12.188 --> 37:14.065
He didn't come to see me about you.

37:17.735 --> 37:18.569
He didn't?

37:21.781 --> 37:23.699
I don't think he even knows about, uh…

37:25.826 --> 37:26.953
whatever this is.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.081
Well, what did he want?

37:30.706 --> 37:31.999
Looking for my father.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.297
So, what did you tell him?

37:39.298 --> 37:40.174
The truth.

37:42.718 --> 37:43.594
Mostly.

37:45.137 --> 37:46.597
And just so you know,

37:47.515 --> 37:49.183
your daddy doesn't scare me.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.186
[chuckles]

38:26.095 --> 38:28.347
[George] Sheldon told me
what you said to him.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.935
Little strong, wasn't it?

38:35.146 --> 38:36.564
[Walter] He needed to hear it…

38:38.149 --> 38:39.900
from somebody that gives a damn.

38:42.695 --> 38:43.654
You know I do.

38:45.531 --> 38:47.825
It's a funny way of showing it,
if I'm honest.

38:49.910 --> 38:51.245
Honesty's the game, is it?

38:51.329 --> 38:52.663
[Walter sighs]

38:52.747 --> 38:53.664
Okay.

39:03.966 --> 39:04.800
[clears throat]

39:07.720 --> 39:10.139
[inhales] You know,
you can't really care about someone

39:10.222 --> 39:13.142
that you're so jealous of
it turns you inside out.

39:15.895 --> 39:16.896
[sighs]

39:17.396 --> 39:19.523
He's sick, George.

39:22.151 --> 39:23.069
And you…

39:23.819 --> 39:26.447
you keep feeding his delusions,

39:27.198 --> 39:29.241
-like it's a sport or something.
-[huffs]

39:33.579 --> 39:36.457
Sampson Steel died the moment
your father stepped off the ledge.

39:36.540 --> 39:39.251
-What?
-Clinging to it is your delusion.

39:39.335 --> 39:41.754
And what would you know
about saving a business?

39:42.254 --> 39:45.091
Everything that you have
is handed to you on a platter.

39:45.174 --> 39:46.217
You arrogant little sh--

39:46.300 --> 39:50.679
This isn't about saving the mill, Walt.
This is about saving yourself!

39:52.723 --> 39:55.309
Sheldon's just trying
to do the same in his own way.

39:59.105 --> 40:00.231
So, you believe him?

40:00.731 --> 40:01.565
[scoffs]

40:02.691 --> 40:03.818
His visions.

40:07.530 --> 40:11.909
You really believe that there's something
out there in the middle of the ocean?

40:14.745 --> 40:15.996
I have no idea.

40:17.748 --> 40:19.959
All I know is he needs this.

40:21.293 --> 40:24.213
He needs this journey to heal.

40:28.551 --> 40:30.052
Maybe he's not the only one.

40:48.237 --> 40:50.656
[Jane] Wait. Slow down.
You want me to go where?

40:50.739 --> 40:53.242
Morocco.
That's where we'll find the ship, I think.

40:53.325 --> 40:56.287
And… Walt agreed to this?

40:56.370 --> 40:59.874
Well, Walt didn't at first. I thought
the whole thing was gonna go belly-up…

40:59.957 --> 41:02.084
[laughs] …but somehow
George convinced him.

41:02.168 --> 41:04.503
I… I don't know
what I would do without George.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.131
Sheldon, stop. Stop.

41:07.923 --> 41:11.010
You… you… you said
that everything was gonna be okay.

41:11.969 --> 41:14.096
-You… you said that you were okay.
-I am.

41:15.055 --> 41:17.766
I am. This is… this is real, all of it.

41:18.350 --> 41:21.061
Well, did you see me…

41:23.230 --> 41:24.523
in your visions?

41:24.607 --> 41:26.484
-[Sheldon] Well…
-Was I there?

41:50.799 --> 41:51.759
No, Jane.

42:03.812 --> 42:06.982
[Jack] What was your thought process
after Jane left you? Your narrative?

42:08.901 --> 42:10.236
[Sheldon] It was a punishment

42:11.820 --> 42:13.155
for not being good enough.

42:14.198 --> 42:17.201
-That's not what she told you, was it?
-[Sheldon] Okay, I get it.

42:18.160 --> 42:22.373
The Code is a symbol for being a good boy
and that we can't prevent loss or tragedy.

42:22.456 --> 42:23.415
I'm not naive.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.042
But…?

42:26.377 --> 42:29.171
But the world never used to be
so intentionally cruel.

42:29.255 --> 42:33.676
It used to be that if you gave your kids
everything they needed, they'd be okay.

42:35.803 --> 42:38.806
That you protect your country,
they call you a hero.

42:38.889 --> 42:43.477
The world has always been chaos and shit,
my friend.

42:44.645 --> 42:46.355
It's your beliefs
that have kept you hopeful.

42:46.438 --> 42:50.651
"If I'm good, bad things won't happen
to me or the ones that I love."

42:50.734 --> 42:53.696
It's a construct
you created a long time ago

42:53.779 --> 42:55.781
to shield yourself from reality.

42:55.864 --> 42:58.951
But reality always wins out,

42:59.535 --> 43:02.079
no matter how profoundly
we rail against it.

43:02.162 --> 43:05.457
So, what are you saying? That there is
no difference between right and wrong?

43:05.541 --> 43:08.002
That… that morality is
some kind of an intellectual exercise?

43:08.085 --> 43:09.044
No.

43:10.087 --> 43:14.174
I'm suggesting that you exist
in a world of your own creation,

43:14.842 --> 43:17.553
a world of black and white, good and evil.

43:17.636 --> 43:20.180
And it has protected you
for the most part.

43:22.057 --> 43:22.891
But…?

43:23.392 --> 43:26.812
But it doesn't allow
for the way the world really is

43:26.895 --> 43:29.481
and how the majority of people live in it,

43:30.899 --> 43:32.985
in shades of gray.

43:37.072 --> 43:38.198
[knocking on door]

43:38.282 --> 43:39.366
[sighs]

43:43.329 --> 43:46.540
Well, I'm afraid
we'll have to continue this next week.

43:47.124 --> 43:48.042
Okay.

43:49.585 --> 43:50.586
[sighs]

43:51.587 --> 43:52.755
Thank you, Jack.

43:54.548 --> 43:57.217
Sometimes it feels like
you're the only one that I can talk to.

43:58.719 --> 44:02.431
[Jack] Isn't it interesting
that the one person you come to for advice

44:02.514 --> 44:05.142
is the man
who tried to kill you for 20 years?

44:06.852 --> 44:10.105
[Sheldon] Honestly, Jack,
no one else understands me.

44:11.690 --> 44:12.566
[chuckles]

44:12.650 --> 44:15.653
Well, you always know where to find me.

44:24.870 --> 44:25.704
[slaps table]

44:29.708 --> 44:30.876
[beeping]

44:30.959 --> 44:32.503
[door buzzing, unlocking]

44:36.048 --> 44:37.591
[alert buzzing]

44:40.803 --> 44:42.596
[indistinct chattering over PA]

44:45.307 --> 44:48.769
[dramatic music playing]
