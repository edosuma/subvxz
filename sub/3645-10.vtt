SAM:
<i> Previously on</i> Aquarius...

00:06.741 --> 00:08.607
She's had
electroshock therapy.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.376
She's not quite herself.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.144
<i> Recovery can take some time.</i>

00:12.146 --> 00:13.178
I'm taking you home.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.413
You like that home cooking?

00:14.415 --> 00:16.015
Go ahead
and lay down, Ralph.

00:16.017 --> 00:17.950
All your boys
are waiting for you.

00:17.952 --> 00:20.586
Up there, in the green
pastures of the Lord.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.688
So you're saying you're just
gonna get me clean

00:22.690 --> 00:23.555
and I'm just gonna relapse?

00:23.557 --> 00:25.424
This isn't something
you ever leave behind.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.960
Relapse happens
more often than not.

00:27.962 --> 00:29.595
Hal's been
letting us crash here.

00:29.597 --> 00:34.366
I can work on my music
without having to scramble
for food and shelter.

00:34.368 --> 00:38.570
I need you to take
a drop from a CI
with the black separatists.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.272

BUNCHY:
The evidence was planted!

00:46.647 --> 00:50.049
We got history, Hodiak!
I'm calling it in.

00:57.858 --> 01:00.993
CHARLIE: There's only
one thing left to do.

01:00.995 --> 01:08.100
Now, you and Sadie know
what I'm asking you for,
don't you, Tex?

01:08.169 --> 01:10.436
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:11.439 --> 01:12.771

01:14.942 --> 01:17.543
Yes.
Use knives.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.612
CHARLIE: Yes.

Paint the walls with blood.

01:26.353 --> 01:27.953
Yes.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.523
Yes. Have him call me back.

01:31.525 --> 01:34.593
Hold on. I have
a new business number.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.196
It's 213-450...

01:37.331 --> 01:38.564
Yes, that's right.

01:38.566 --> 01:42.301
No, that's no longer
my home number.

01:42.369 --> 01:43.669
Thank you.

01:45.973 --> 01:48.740
Can I read here
while you work?

01:50.211 --> 01:51.710
I don't want to be alone.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.345
Of course, sweetie.

Ah.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.785
Rereading your favorite.

01:59.787 --> 02:04.957
You loved Jo.
Wanted to put on plays like
she did and be a writer.

02:06.060 --> 02:08.127
I don't remember any of it.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.395
It'll come back.

02:10.397 --> 02:12.598
I spoke to a doctor
who assured me

02:12.600 --> 02:13.832
the memory loss
is temporary.

02:13.834 --> 02:18.437
Meanwhile, you get to
enjoy your favorites
like they're brand new.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.706
Daddy, what happened
to Charlie?

02:20.708 --> 02:23.142
I don't know.
I found you at the hospital.

02:23.144 --> 02:25.644
I remember
being with Charlie,
and then I left.

02:25.646 --> 02:29.148
Does anyone need a reason
to run away from a creep?

02:29.150 --> 02:31.550
I'm damn glad you did.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.552
You don't want to tell me.

02:34.121 --> 02:35.487
Daddy, what did I do?

02:35.489 --> 02:39.158
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

02:39.293 --> 02:45.697
You were a high-spirited girl
with a mother who wanted
to squash you.

02:48.269 --> 02:53.138
I blamed you for
your rebellion,
but that was just...

02:55.442 --> 02:57.009
I was scared.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.414
I thought you hated me.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.583
(EXHALES)

03:05.920 --> 03:09.321
I was so...

03:09.590 --> 03:11.590
Miserable, Emma.

03:11.592 --> 03:16.028
I lied to myself
that you were ready
to be on your own,

03:18.098 --> 03:20.766
but you were
still a little girl.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.536
Forgive me.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.973
I love you, Emma.

03:30.077 --> 03:32.144
I just didn't know.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.914
Or trust.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.218
Forgive me.

03:39.753 --> 03:42.020
I love you, Daddy.

03:42.223 --> 03:45.257
And it's okay, you know.
It's really okay.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.893
I don't care that
you're homosexual.

03:49.663 --> 03:53.966
Like Jo. You have to
be true to yourself.

03:54.435 --> 03:55.934
That's all
that Charlie wants.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.237
For himself,
for me, and you.

03:58.239 --> 04:03.041
You have to go to the now.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.844
To the real.

04:06.780 --> 04:10.816
I was trying
to help Charlie.

04:10.818 --> 04:14.586
I wasn't running away.
I wanted to save him.

KRISTIN: They had to be
from United Africa.

04:22.863 --> 04:26.665
Had to be? What?
Were they wearing signs?

04:27.101 --> 04:29.167
I can describe them.
If you just bust

04:29.169 --> 04:30.802
everybody at UA,
I'll spot them.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.572
Maybe I'll just set her up
with a sketch artist.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.674
I don't want to draw
no damn pictures!

04:35.676 --> 04:37.876
I want you to go
to UA headquarters.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.511
What happened?

04:39.780 --> 04:41.113
They came blasting in,

04:41.115 --> 04:44.049
and Bunchy tried to get away,

04:44.051 --> 04:45.851
and I couldn't get there.

04:45.853 --> 04:48.553
(SOBS) They just
kept shooting.

04:51.325 --> 04:52.391
Babe, you shouldn't...

04:52.393 --> 04:54.493
It's okay. Sit down.

05:05.973 --> 05:09.408
Why are you sitting there?
They're getting away!

05:09.410 --> 05:10.609
Look, ma'am, right now,

05:10.611 --> 05:13.412
my job is just to
find out what you know.

05:13.414 --> 05:16.315
Hey, is this your case?

05:16.317 --> 05:18.350
Yeah. I got the call.

05:18.352 --> 05:18.984
I want it.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.420
This is Westwood,
not Hollywood.
It's Wilshire's case.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.188
I'll clear it with Garrick.
He'll approve it.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.756
Ain't gonna be
an easy case to close.

05:24.758 --> 05:28.760
The shooter or
shooters got away clean.
Like a gang killing.

05:28.762 --> 05:29.961
You can't trust
the witnesses,

Less of a headache then.

05:36.704 --> 05:37.302
Hey.
Come on.

05:37.304 --> 05:39.371
Don't you want to question
the other witnesses?

05:39.373 --> 05:41.073
Send me your report.
Yeah.

05:41.075 --> 05:43.241
You'll get it, Hodiak.

05:43.243 --> 05:47.279
Are you gonna send
them in triplicate?
That'll show me.

Where's Dennis the Menace,
hmm?

Mr. Dennis not here.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.899
No. No, no, no.
He's not recording.

He's not at

06:09.737 --> 06:10.669
not at the Whiskey A Go-Go.

would like him
to have this...

You question her.
I'm staying.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.186
She's a witness.
You're her husband.

in front of their hubbies.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.289
I'll keep my mouth shut.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.725
Well, then she's gonna have
to come back to the precinct.

07:06.727 --> 07:07.492
It's already a big break

07:07.494 --> 07:08.794
that she was allowed
to come back home.

into interrogation.

busy, anyway?

at Mama's today

seeing me like this.

in, like, two hours.

07:48.068 --> 07:51.636
Sure. What makes
you so sure it was UA?

07:51.638 --> 07:54.039
Well, it's just like I told
that dumb-ass detective.

07:54.041 --> 07:57.108
The FBI's been using
UA to get at Bunchy.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.744
They have been tapping
the Panthers' phones,

07:59.746 --> 08:02.380
sending in spies,
sending hate mail.

08:02.382 --> 08:03.181
You know that.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.083
And you know they
even planted drugs.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.919
That was our
very own Red Squad.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.321
Well, it's the
same difference.

08:09.323 --> 08:13.225
The FBI are working through
the LAPD, and don't deny it.

08:13.227 --> 08:15.527
And Bri's been
making excuses,

08:15.529 --> 08:16.728
but you're smarter than that.

08:16.730 --> 08:21.366
Just arrest everybody at UA
and I will pick them out.

08:21.368 --> 08:21.933
This ain't Russia.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.870
I can't just round up
100 people on suspicion.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.772
So you're not
gonna do nothing.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.207
Just like Bunchy said.

08:29.209 --> 08:32.744
When it comes down to it,
a cop is loyal to cops.

08:32.746 --> 08:33.745
Kris...
Not the law.

08:33.747 --> 08:36.414
I admired Bunchy
as much as you did.

08:36.583 --> 08:37.349
He was arrogant.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.317
He acted like he was
a law unto himself,

08:39.319 --> 08:41.086
and he was brave as a god,

08:41.088 --> 08:43.054
and he hated cops.

08:43.423 --> 08:44.022
And we hated him.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.958
So I understand
that you don't believe
that we're gonna do

08:46.960 --> 08:49.227
right by him,
but this is me.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.795
You know me.

08:50.797 --> 08:51.963
I am arrogant.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.932
And I am a law unto myself.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.434
You give me a description,
and I will get them.

08:56.436 --> 08:59.504
FBI or no, I will get them.

09:00.107 --> 09:04.509
How do you
think Bunchy's death
will affect your marriage?

09:05.212 --> 09:09.047
I guess it'll be
rough for a while.
Kristin's real upset.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.651
No, what I mean, Brian,
and this is to your credit,

09:12.653 --> 09:13.418
when we talked about

09:13.420 --> 09:15.020
what it was that triggered
you to go back to using,

09:15.022 --> 09:19.090
you talked about
Kristin working
with the Panthers.

09:19.092 --> 09:19.925
In one session, you said,

09:19.927 --> 09:24.229
"I need to know
she's got my back,
like we're riding together,

09:24.231 --> 09:25.864
"riding life together."

09:25.866 --> 09:27.599
Yeah, for sure.

09:27.601 --> 09:28.033
I rely on her.

09:28.035 --> 09:31.970
So, since
it bothered you that she was
working with the Panthers,

09:31.972 --> 09:33.805
how do you feel
about Bunchy being dead?

09:33.807 --> 09:36.975
What, are you suggesting
that I'm not sorry he's dead?

09:36.977 --> 09:38.777
Are you not sorry?

09:40.180 --> 09:41.713
No, it's bad.

09:42.316 --> 09:45.116
It's bad for
the black community.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.385
He was a leader.

09:48.488 --> 09:49.754
But?

09:51.191 --> 09:52.857
Yeah. Okay.

09:53.493 --> 09:57.762
I hope it'll mean
Kristin will be home more.

09:57.764 --> 10:01.299
And I need her.
Bernadette needs her.

10:01.902 --> 10:05.537
They say it's an ill wind
that blows nobody any good.

10:05.539 --> 10:08.607
So maybe that's not
bad for my marriage.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.619
You're kidding me.

10:21.021 --> 10:25.890
Kidding?
Man, I do love to kid.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.927
What do you want me
to kid you about, huh?

10:28.929 --> 10:31.429

Where'd you get it?

Hi, Vic.

10:46.647 --> 10:47.846
Hi.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.415

you're using again?

here to pick up chicks.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.596
and I'm sure
Cutler wants to see you.

11:38.598 --> 11:41.032
Sam, get in here.

11:41.435 --> 11:44.736
I'd ask you why you stole
the Bunchy Carter murder
from Wilshire,

11:44.738 --> 11:46.071
but I know the answer.
You love trouble.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.807
And I'd tell you to give
the hot potato back,
but I don't have to.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.775
All right.
I'll talk to Garrick.
He'll let me keep it.

11:50.777 --> 11:54.345
Yeah, no, he won't.
This comes from
Garrick's office.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.847
The FBI's
taking over the case.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.048
Why? What makes
this a federal case?

11:57.050 --> 11:59.617
They use
out-of-state bullets?
Attempted kidnapping.

11:59.619 --> 12:00.185
Kidnapping by murder?

12:00.187 --> 12:02.454
And the killers are suspected
to be foreign agents.

12:02.456 --> 12:03.822
From what country? Oakland?

12:03.824 --> 12:06.591
It's the FBI.
They can make up
any crap they want.

12:06.593 --> 12:07.659
This is a break for you.

12:07.661 --> 12:10.095
This is a case
that'll never close.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.197
Okay, fine.
It's the FBI's headache.

to throw in my ass,

I have for you is urgent,

and I need to be
at a consciousness

13:17.998 --> 13:19.564
Anyway, I needed
to see you pronto,

13:19.566 --> 13:21.900
because Wanda says that
UA is gonna take down
the Panthers

13:21.902 --> 13:25.303

weak and leaderless.
She wasn't positive when,

13:25.305 --> 13:28.273

it will be tonight
or tomorrow.

What are you gonna do?

13:30.977 --> 13:34.245
I'm going to have a steak
and catch the Lakers game.

13:34.247 --> 13:37.015
So you're just
gonna let UA hit them?

we wanted to happen.

because no one else

don't do something,

23:06.185 --> 23:08.018
Who were the shooters?

23:08.154 --> 23:10.421
I have responsibilities.

23:10.590 --> 23:11.989
To my CI, to my case.

23:11.991 --> 23:13.924
Whether you
respect it or not,
I'm doing my job.

23:13.926 --> 23:16.193
It turns out that
part of your job
was setting up Bunchy.

23:16.195 --> 23:19.263
If I wanted Bunchy dead,
why would I be
asking you to stop UA

23:19.265 --> 23:21.165
from killing the Panthers?
You're not making sense.

23:21.167 --> 23:22.533
Attack of conscience
after the fact.

23:22.535 --> 23:23.968
You didn't know
they were gonna
assassinate him.

23:23.970 --> 23:28.038
Look, Charmain.
Your job, whether you
meant it or not,

23:28.040 --> 23:30.574
helped murder two people.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.743
But maybe murdering
a man only bothers you

23:32.745 --> 23:35.279
when you're sleeping
with him.

23:39.185 --> 23:41.552
You know what? You're right.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.687
I have changed, Sam.

23:43.689 --> 23:45.723
I've turned into
a coldhearted cop

23:45.725 --> 23:48.526
who manipulates people
to close cases.

23:49.662 --> 23:52.396
After all,
I learned from a master.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.198
(DOOR OPENS)

23:54.300 --> 23:54.865
(DOOR CLOSES)

23:54.867 --> 24:00.371
All right. But no alcohol.
That's just as bad
as doing heroin.

24:00.373 --> 24:03.707
Hey, we are drug addicts,
not alcoholics,
(CHUCKLES)

24:03.709 --> 24:05.376
so it's cool.

24:06.813 --> 24:08.379
Whoa, uh...
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

24:08.381 --> 24:12.850
Hey, Roy?
I don't owe you money
or anything, do I?

24:15.655 --> 24:18.589
Okay. So, you're pissed.

24:18.591 --> 24:23.861
Your buddy, the cop? Bri?
Give him up, or...

24:23.863 --> 24:27.698
Yeah. He's yours.
He's completely yours.

24:29.168 --> 24:31.335
HAL: No, no.
SADIE: Come on, let's go.

24:31.337 --> 24:34.738
Oh, no ceilings.
No ceilings.

24:34.740 --> 24:38.909
I want to go outside.
I want to feel the air.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.945
I want to feel the heavens.

24:40.947 --> 24:44.582
All china-blue
and air on my face.

24:44.584 --> 24:45.649
(BABY CRYING)

24:45.651 --> 24:47.785
Sweet air on my face.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.621
I want to go back.

24:51.057 --> 24:53.057
I want to go back.
No, Hal. I can't.

24:53.059 --> 24:54.892
I have to change
the baby's diaper

24:54.894 --> 24:56.427
and there's
nobody else here.

24:56.429 --> 24:59.129
Charlie and Tex
are still missing.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.298
My eyes.

25:01.467 --> 25:05.669
My eyes need
to breathe, Sadie.

25:06.572 --> 25:08.072
I can do it.

25:08.508 --> 25:10.007
Oh...

25:10.543 --> 25:12.243
Sweet Sadie.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.211
Ah.

25:14.914 --> 25:17.681
I want to go to Spahn Ranch.

25:18.417 --> 25:21.085
I was so happy there.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.454
All the horsies.

25:24.357 --> 25:27.491
All the beautiful
horsies there.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.160
Horses. Where?

25:30.162 --> 25:32.029
Where did
you see horses?

25:32.298 --> 25:34.164
At Spahn.

25:34.166 --> 25:37.735
Playing cowboys and
Indians on the sets.

25:42.675 --> 25:46.810
Like sets, like,
movie sets?
Yeah.

25:47.446 --> 25:49.113
Old movie sets.

25:49.115 --> 25:54.852
Nothing but play
for miles and miles
and miles.

25:55.755 --> 25:58.422
All the boys and girls

25:58.424 --> 26:00.925
were so happy together.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.294
At Spahn Ranch.

26:04.564 --> 26:06.163
Would you like
a drink, Gordon?

26:06.165 --> 26:08.966
Uh, a little early for me.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.200
Well, have a seat.

26:10.202 --> 26:14.038
How's your tennis game
coming along these days?

26:14.040 --> 26:17.041
I'd die a happy man
if I had a backhand.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.676
(LAUGHING)

26:18.844 --> 26:21.045
I'd love to play someday.

26:21.647 --> 26:23.647
Any chance for
a game this weekend?

26:23.649 --> 26:26.350
Oh, I don't play
singles anymore.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.218
Knees can't take it.

26:28.854 --> 26:30.054
I'm sorry to get
right to the point,

26:30.056 --> 26:33.023
but I'm afraid I can't move
my firm's business over.

26:33.025 --> 26:37.428
My partners have committed
to Walters, Chambers,
and White.

26:37.997 --> 26:40.397
I see. Well...

26:41.000 --> 26:43.400
That's disappointing,
of course,

26:43.402 --> 26:48.739
but I'm glad I can
continue to handle your
family's personal business?

26:48.741 --> 26:50.908
Ken, that's why I'm here.

26:50.910 --> 26:54.345
You've always done
a fine job for me.

26:54.347 --> 26:58.048
You handled that (EXHALES)
mess with Timmy.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.783
You know,
I've always been grateful.

26:59.785 --> 27:03.654
I do, you know,
it's always been a...

27:03.656 --> 27:06.523
Ken, I want to be blunt.

27:07.259 --> 27:08.692
I have to move
my business, too.

27:08.694 --> 27:12.463
I came today here
because I know you've been
calling around,

27:12.465 --> 27:15.232
trying to bring in
your clients.

27:15.234 --> 27:18.469
And I want to save you
some embarrassment.

27:18.704 --> 27:21.538
No one in Los Angeles...

27:21.807 --> 27:24.775
In California, really...

27:26.846 --> 27:28.846
No one will hire you.

27:30.549 --> 27:32.116
No one? (CHUCKLES)

27:32.118 --> 27:36.086
I know that Hal
and Grace's father
are furious.

27:36.088 --> 27:38.956
Spreading wild,
ridiculous rumors...

27:38.958 --> 27:40.858
Ken, I'm sorry
to interrupt again.

27:40.860 --> 27:45.963
But the reason
no one will hire you
has nothing to do with...

27:47.199 --> 27:52.736
No one cares where you find
your pleasure in life, Ken.

27:53.372 --> 27:56.507
Your father-in-law
has made it his business

27:56.509 --> 27:59.309
to speak with your
entire client list.

27:59.311 --> 28:01.612
And he has
made it clear to them,

28:01.614 --> 28:03.814
if they want
his goodwill...

28:06.085 --> 28:07.351
(EXHALES)

28:09.355 --> 28:12.623
Do you know
anyone in New York?

28:13.192 --> 28:15.426
I am sure there is
a firm in New York

28:15.428 --> 28:19.730
that could use a man
of your experience
and talent.

28:19.732 --> 28:23.133
I'm gonna have my secretary
send some names over.

28:23.135 --> 28:27.805

don't know

28:30.242 --> 28:31.008
Oh.

28:31.010 --> 28:34.778
Well, I have to be
on my way.

28:36.515 --> 28:38.248
Goodbye, Ken.

Hey.

28:45.925 --> 28:49.259
This lemonade has turned
and it's warm.

28:56.602 --> 29:00.637

some ice, you fascists.

See, Blackbird has
a vigorous stream.

29:23.896 --> 29:27.131
Charlie, all you have
is a short straw.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.032
(LAUGHING)

29:30.836 --> 29:32.202
Can you leave town?

29:32.204 --> 29:33.237
WANDA: You mean LA?

29:33.239 --> 29:34.605
It'd be better if you
went away for a while.

29:34.607 --> 29:37.274
Do you have some family
you can visit somewhere?

29:37.276 --> 29:39.209
Why do I want
to leave town?

29:39.211 --> 29:40.811
Because of me?

29:41.447 --> 29:42.479
(SOFTLY) You followed me?

29:42.481 --> 29:44.481
And they say you'll never
make detective.

29:44.483 --> 29:47.117
You could blow
my cover and Wanda's.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.018
He's a cop?

29:48.020 --> 29:49.620
Let me explain
the situation to you.

29:49.622 --> 29:52.956
You tell me the shooters
who did John Huggins
and Bunchy Carter,

29:52.958 --> 29:53.824
and I don't tell
all your friends

29:53.826 --> 29:56.426
at United Africa that you're
a police informer.

29:56.428 --> 29:57.494
You're bluffing.

29:57.496 --> 30:00.030
I never bluff.
Ask Charmain.

30:04.436 --> 30:05.636
They'll kill me.

30:05.638 --> 30:07.738
You helped murder
two men.

30:07.740 --> 30:10.407
Your death would
only be justice.

30:10.876 --> 30:16.079
You don't know what
you're messing with.
This is an FBI operation.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.148
I don't care.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.825
CUT: Sam, you can't hold...

30:27.827 --> 30:28.525
Watch me. Meg?

30:28.527 --> 30:30.427
Kristin's in the break room.
I need some...

30:30.429 --> 30:32.262
First lineup's ready to go.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.097
Line-up for Shafe's wife?

30:34.099 --> 30:36.767
Him, second from the right.
He shot Huggins.

30:36.769 --> 30:38.569
Take your time.
Defense attorneys can make...

30:38.571 --> 30:42.406
It's him.
I'll never forget his face.

30:42.408 --> 30:46.076
We'll get corroboration, Cut.
There were plenty
of other witnesses.

30:46.078 --> 30:47.311
I'll start
the second line-up.

30:47.313 --> 30:49.213
If you got other witnesses,
get them here.

30:49.215 --> 30:50.414
All right.
Now, no disrespect.

30:50.416 --> 30:51.582
But you're
a cop's wife. Okay?

30:51.584 --> 30:53.784
So any dumb-ass attorney
can say you were

30:53.786 --> 30:55.052
unduly influenced
and throw this out.

30:55.054 --> 30:57.254
We'll do another
line-up tomorrow
with other witnesses,

30:57.256 --> 30:59.022
but we need them
booked and arraigned today

30:59.024 --> 31:00.591
so the Feds
don't interfere.

31:00.593 --> 31:02.860
Oh, so that's
what the rush is.

31:02.862 --> 31:07.464
Yeah, we need to
get them into the system.
The Feds can't stop us.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.534
Okay. Then I'll
leave you to it.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.870
What? No grousing?

31:12.872 --> 31:13.871
I got no complaint.

31:13.873 --> 31:15.572
No bellyaching
about how I'm ruining

31:15.574 --> 31:17.140
your career and
destroying my own?

31:17.142 --> 31:19.142
Hey, like the book says,
"I'm okay, you're okay."

31:19.144 --> 31:23.313
Hey, Cut, I'm okay
if you stay out of my way.

31:23.315 --> 31:27.684
Sam, from now on,
I won't try to help you.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.753
Okay? I won't
try to stop you.

31:29.755 --> 31:31.421
But you're on your own.

31:31.957 --> 31:33.590
Good luck, old friend.

KRISTIN: That's him
on the end, on the left.

31:46.372 --> 31:48.472
He killed Bunchy.

taking me, man?
HENDERSON: To freedom.

31:52.311 --> 31:55.545
As long as you
get your black ass
off of my beat.

31:55.547 --> 31:58.548
I don't want to
do the paperwork
for a drunk and disorderly.

31:58.550 --> 31:59.216
So I'm giving you a break,

31:59.218 --> 32:01.885
as long as you
get your butt out of
West Hollywood.

32:01.887 --> 32:03.287
RALPH:
What about the hippie?

32:03.289 --> 32:04.588
Bye-bye, Blackbird.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.925
Take those broken dreams
and learn to cry.

Okay.

32:37.523 --> 32:38.088
Um...

32:38.090 --> 32:42.025
Bail? You raising money
for the Panthers?

32:42.027 --> 32:43.694
The DA's
piling on charges,

32:43.696 --> 32:45.896
saying they found drugs,
which is some bull,

32:45.898 --> 32:48.231
because Bunchy made sure
there were no drugs.

32:48.233 --> 32:50.434
Yeah, but Bunchy's dead.

32:52.771 --> 32:55.339
So, what are you saying?
As soon as Bunchy's dead,

32:55.341 --> 32:57.507
his people
just gonna toss out
the Ten Point Program?

32:57.509 --> 33:01.378
No, I mean, it's just...
Why are you still
working with them?

33:01.613 --> 33:02.980
"Still"?

33:02.982 --> 33:03.981
I mean, it's just...

33:03.983 --> 33:05.782
You think I worked
with the Panthers

33:05.784 --> 33:07.150
because I had
a thing for Bunchy?

33:07.152 --> 33:10.220
No. Damn it.
Just let me talk.

33:10.990 --> 33:15.592
Bunchy recruited from gangs.
From jails.

33:15.594 --> 33:17.227
Without him around
to keep them in line,

33:17.229 --> 33:18.462
you're just
dealing with criminals.

33:18.464 --> 33:20.163
Well, where do you think
that a movement

33:20.165 --> 33:22.966
of young black men
are gonna come from?

33:22.968 --> 33:26.403
Your people impoverished
a generation of negroes.

33:26.405 --> 33:28.839
And you don't expect
that they're gonna end up

33:28.841 --> 33:31.141
in prison or in gangs?

33:31.877 --> 33:35.345
Wait, my people?

33:36.715 --> 33:39.716
Kristin, we ain't
gonna make it if when
you look at me,

33:39.718 --> 33:41.184
you see a slave owner.

33:41.186 --> 33:44.654
Bri, we ain't
gonna make it if when
you look at my people,

33:44.656 --> 33:47.290
you only see
them as criminals.

33:48.327 --> 33:51.194
Why? Why do you want
to go to San Francisco?

33:51.196 --> 33:52.162

to live there.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.865

to Haight-Ashbury.

(EXHALES DEEPLY)

34:20.492 --> 34:23.527
You don't have
a home. Do you?

34:25.330 --> 34:27.030
They left me.

34:29.268 --> 34:32.235
They were my family.

34:33.505 --> 34:34.871
I know.

34:37.476 --> 34:40.310
And I know where
I can look for them.

34:47.653 --> 34:49.419
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

35:01.700 --> 35:03.100
Ah!

35:03.702 --> 35:04.935
(GRUNTS)

35:06.405 --> 35:08.738
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

35:11.910 --> 35:16.313
Blackbird, bleeding
in the dead of night.

35:17.316 --> 35:21.651
Take your broken dreams
and learn to die.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.186
(SPITS)

35:39.872 --> 35:44.674
The suspects
were apprehended at
United Africa's headquarters.

35:50.082 --> 35:51.915
Who are the cheap suits?

35:51.917 --> 35:53.817
The FBI.
They're taking your suspects.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.252
SAM: Where are
they taking them?
CUT: To nowhere.

35:55.254 --> 35:57.053
I've been told your suspects
are undercover assets.

35:57.055 --> 36:00.190
Too valuable to be charged...
Sam. If you interfere
with the FBI

36:00.192 --> 36:01.091
in the performance
of their duties,

36:01.093 --> 36:03.126
even Garrick won't be able
to save your badge.

36:03.128 --> 36:05.562
Unless you don't care
about being a cop.

36:05.564 --> 36:09.099
In which case,
go blow yourself up.
See if I care.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.648
Kristin won't accept this.

36:24.650 --> 36:26.349
She shouldn't.

36:32.257 --> 36:34.558
Put me on Vice.
I'll be a honey trap.
Anything.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.493
Just do not send me
back to the desk.

36:36.495 --> 36:38.428
They'll have me
scrubbing coffee pots.

36:38.430 --> 36:39.162
You should've
thought of that

36:39.164 --> 36:40.964
before you burned your CI
to your boyfriend.

36:40.966 --> 36:44.067
My boyfriend?
What the hell are
you talking about?

36:44.069 --> 36:45.969
Well, I hope
Hodiak's your boyfriend.

36:45.971 --> 36:50.373
In fact,
considering how he royally
screwed up your career,

36:50.375 --> 36:52.175
he'd better marry you.

36:57.015 --> 36:58.682
I'd like a refill.

37:03.522 --> 37:04.955
What's pretty-boy's name?

37:04.957 --> 37:06.356
Bobby Beausoleil.

37:06.358 --> 37:08.291
He's crashing with
a weirdo chemist.

37:08.293 --> 37:09.226
A Buddhist.

37:09.228 --> 37:11.294
No. Patty said
he makes drugs.

37:11.296 --> 37:12.829
Gods, drugs,
neither are gonna help.

37:12.831 --> 37:16.866
We can't stay in LA.
Hal's plastic
stopped working. Huh?

37:16.868 --> 37:20.470
And when the Panthers
find out that you
killed Ralph,

37:20.472 --> 37:23.006
then all the Blackbirds
are gonna come after us.

37:23.008 --> 37:26.142
HAL: Sadie!
Play with me, Sadie!

37:26.144 --> 37:28.178
BOBBY: No money,
no honey, Hal.

37:28.180 --> 37:31.114
Charlie,
Charlie, listen to me.
I know where we can go.

37:31.116 --> 37:32.983
Hal said there's
an old movie ranch?

37:32.985 --> 37:34.718
Movie ranch?
What the hell is that?

37:34.720 --> 37:38.355
HAL: Wiggle me, Sadie.
A little wiggle
in my piggle.

37:38.357 --> 37:40.190
It's where they used to
make westerns, okay.

37:40.192 --> 37:41.791
And Hal said
there's nobody there.

37:41.793 --> 37:44.027
We could just
go there and crash.

37:44.296 --> 37:45.895
Where is it?

37:46.265 --> 37:47.764
Way up north.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.466
HAL: Play with me, Sadie!

37:49.468 --> 37:52.269
So while all
the Blackbirds flap around

37:52.271 --> 37:54.471
and hunt us with
their broken wings,

37:54.473 --> 37:57.574
then we can fly north,
not south,

37:57.576 --> 37:59.843
and right there,
on that ranch...

38:01.647 --> 38:04.614
We can play
cowboys and Indians.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.049
HAL: Sadie!

38:06.318 --> 38:08.952
I should've quit
on the spot.

38:09.354 --> 38:10.787
I don't need that job.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.355
I got my pension.

38:12.357 --> 38:13.723
Mmm.

38:13.725 --> 38:15.592
That'll never happen.

38:15.594 --> 38:17.961
They'll have to
carry you out.

38:18.030 --> 38:19.362
Mmm.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.097
You don't know me.

38:21.099 --> 38:23.033
You think you do,
but you don't.

38:23.035 --> 38:24.801
I know you.

38:24.870 --> 38:26.069
Inside and out.

38:26.071 --> 38:28.638
Oh, yeah?
What do you know?
Mmm...

38:28.774 --> 38:31.007
I know you're an addict.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.677
Come on, that's easy.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.378
No. Not the booze.

38:35.614 --> 38:39.816
The booze is your sedative.
Booze doesn't get you high.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.519
Cases get you high.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.688
You, Sam, are addicted

38:44.690 --> 38:47.357
to being a detective. Mmm.
Oh!

38:47.359 --> 38:49.192
The wife's complaint.
No.

38:49.194 --> 38:51.027
I'm addicted to my job.

38:51.029 --> 38:54.097
No. Not to being a cop.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.633
To solving a mystery.

38:57.269 --> 38:57.634
Hmm.

38:57.636 --> 39:00.236
As soon as you get a case,
you get all excited,

39:00.238 --> 39:01.237
and it's all
you can think about,

39:01.239 --> 39:05.108
and you alienate everybody
you care about to solve it.

39:05.210 --> 39:07.243
But as soon as you do,

39:07.646 --> 39:11.247
you feel empty,
and you need another.

39:12.751 --> 39:16.720
You're addicted to
solving mysteries
to distract you from

39:16.722 --> 39:19.656
investigating
the real mystery.

39:21.293 --> 39:24.327
Okay, I'll bite.
What's the real mystery?

39:24.730 --> 39:26.029
(CHUCKLES)

39:28.200 --> 39:30.100
Why isn't it enough?

39:30.302 --> 39:31.468
Hmm?

39:31.470 --> 39:35.405
When someone truly
and deeply loves you, Sam.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.341
Why isn't that enough?

39:44.049 --> 39:45.348
(CHUCKLES)

39:54.092 --> 39:55.625
(SUITCASE THUDS)

39:59.264 --> 40:03.433
I'm gonna move
with Mom and Dad
until we figure things out.

40:03.735 --> 40:08.171
You want to see Bernadette?
Come any time.
Just call ahead.

40:08.173 --> 40:09.839
I don't...

40:10.175 --> 40:11.074
You're moving out?

40:11.076 --> 40:14.177
Brian, I don't
want to talk anymore.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.113
I'm sick of talk.

40:17.115 --> 40:19.516
You're a part
of something...

40:20.552 --> 40:24.687
That's evil. That's what.

40:25.090 --> 40:28.792
It's bent on
keeping me down. Me...

40:29.361 --> 40:31.261
Me and your daughter.

40:35.434 --> 40:38.234
That's who you work for.
The enemy.

40:40.105 --> 40:42.605
I can't live with the enemy.

41:07.732 --> 41:12.569
Charlie, you're all right.
You're all right.
You're really all right.

41:18.977 --> 41:22.278
Sister Sadie, you're safe.

41:59.751 --> 42:01.317
Charlie.

42:01.653 --> 42:03.820
This stops now.

42:03.822 --> 42:07.957
Tex is his own man, Ken.

42:10.462 --> 42:12.362
We're ready.

42:13.932 --> 42:18.835
Not my girl.
Not Emma. Please, no.
