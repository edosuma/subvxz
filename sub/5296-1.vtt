41:27.376 --> 41:29.656
Mmm. Everybody except you.

41:31.976 --> 41:36.776
Pike murdered Morrison. Set me

And I know where he is.

41:45.455 --> 41:47.455

Taken about a month ago,

LYNCH:
We don't know.

42:21.813 --> 42:24.893
We think he's the deep, dark,

Maybe a broker, maybe a buyer.

HANNIBAL:
Lynch, we have common enemies

42:30.693 --> 42:32.653

42:32.733 --> 42:35.092
My team is still your best shot
at getting those plates back.

42:35.372 --> 42:36.572
I wouldn't be so sure.

42:36.652 --> 42:38.892
Then why did you make
the long drive out here?

42:39.012 --> 42:42.012
You and your boys at Langley
want your own private printing press.

42:42.252 --> 42:45.092
That's about as deep
as your patriotism goes.

42:45.652 --> 42:47.652
So, what would you need from me?

I swore to my team
that I would clear our names.

You of all people must understand
the value of a name.

42:56.811 --> 42:57.771
Now, listen.

42:59.091 --> 43:02.811
I want full reinstatement

43:05.651 --> 43:07.610
I can't get you out of here.

Not legally, at least.

43:11.770 --> 43:15.050
This is something the boys at Langley
do very, very well.

01:34:42.108 --> 01:34:44.948
Pike hit the ship with a SMAW!
He punched a hole in the hull!

01:34:45.108 --> 01:34:46.388
What about the plan?

01:34:46.508 --> 01:34:48.867
<i>FACE: Pike just blew up the plan!
We are ad-libbing!</i>

01:34:48.987 --> 01:34:50.227
Bosco, get out of there!

01:34:50.427 --> 01:34:51.667
I'm going for Hannibal.

01:34:52.707 --> 01:34:54.467
-Cover me. I'm going for those plates.
-Yes, sir.

01:34:58.827 --> 01:35:01.507
The boat is going over! Get out of there!

01:35:01.627 --> 01:35:02.907
Bos, hang on!

01:36:43.781 --> 01:36:45.301
Oh! Jeez!

01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:48.460
Shit.

01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:51.820
Bosco, Pike's got the high ground.
I'm running low on ammo, man.

01:37:03.739 --> 01:37:04.899
Shit!

01:37:05.019 --> 01:37:07.179
How are you doing, handsome?

01:37:07.419 --> 01:37:09.779
Shit, can you cycle that weapon.
Nice work.

01:37:09.899 --> 01:37:11.659
Jeez, close friends and bullets.

01:37:11.779 --> 01:37:13.059
Where are they when you need them?

01:37:16.139 --> 01:37:18.859
Don't take this too personally,
but look here,

01:37:19.499 --> 01:37:21.578
smile, wait for the flash.

Lynch.

Come on, Smith! Stop bullshitting.

Lynch...

Where am I?

01:38:27.534 --> 01:38:28.934
Come on, Lynch.

01:38:31.734 --> 01:38:32.774

01:38:43.054 --> 01:38:44.294
Lynch!

01:38:57.933 --> 01:39:02.372
{WHOOPS} There you are, Hannibal.
Been looking all over for you.

01:39:03.412 --> 01:39:05.492
Hey, don't let the scarf fool you.

01:39:05.572 --> 01:39:09.492
My muay Thai is pretty good.
My jujitsu is a little better, but...

01:39:09.652 --> 01:39:13.252
You had this whole sleight-of-hand thing
going with the containers

01:39:13.372 --> 01:39:16.652
and the cars, and the fireworks.
"Lynch, Lynch, Lynch! "

01:39:17.932 --> 01:39:22.571
God, that's annoying.
But you give Pike a rocket.

01:39:23.891 --> 01:39:25.851
There's your monkey wrench.

Uh-oh. Your witness, your gun,
your problem.

01:39:48.970 --> 01:39:51.530
You served your country well. Excuse me.

01:39:57.089 --> 01:39:59.889
Hello, Ben,
where have you been all my life?

01:40:02.049 --> 01:40:04.929
Look at us, Hannibal.
Couple of grown men.

01:40:05.249 --> 01:40:07.449
I'm bleeding. You're bleeding.

01:40:07.609 --> 01:40:10.048
{TUTTING}
Don't get up.

01:40:16.208 --> 01:40:17.808
God damn it!

01:40:18.368 --> 01:40:21.168
Your muay Thai is as bad
as your jujitsu, Lynch.

01:40:23.048 --> 01:40:24.848
Better stick with a gun.

01:40:25.008 --> 01:40:28.007
You put a loaded weapon in my hand,
I'll put a bullet in your head.

01:40:43.486 --> 01:40:45.646
I told you I would shoot you.

01:40:46.926 --> 01:40:48.726
Kevlar saved your life.

01:40:49.086 --> 01:40:51.766
Thing is, it doesn't do much good
if I pop you in the head.

01:40:51.846 --> 01:40:53.806
It does if you melt it down.

01:40:55.526 --> 01:40:56.886

Agent Burress.

01:41:41.603 --> 01:41:43.043
What did you call me?

01:41:43.923 --> 01:41:45.883
Agent Vance Burress?
Isn't that your name?

01:41:46.003 --> 01:41:48.363
At least that's the name I've got
on this warrant here,

01:41:48.563 --> 01:41:52.482
and unless you have a piece of paper
that looks exactly like...

01:41:53.642 --> 01:41:55.882
No, that wouldn't help you either.

01:41:56.362 --> 01:41:57.602
Easy, easy.

01:41:59.922 --> 01:42:01.642
You're under arrest for attempted murder,

01:42:01.762 --> 01:42:03.802
violations of the Civil False Claims Act,

01:42:03.922 --> 01:42:07.282
and the theft of top secret
government engraving plates.

01:42:07.402 --> 01:42:08.441
Easy.

01:42:11.161 --> 01:42:13.041
I guess the plan went okay,

01:42:13.161 --> 01:42:16.601
considering Pike did blow up the boat,
which I didn't account for at all.

01:42:16.721 --> 01:42:18.641
Bullets didn't go through.

Not... Not good.

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:26.840

-Not good.

-I feel sane.
-{LAUGHS}

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:31.480

01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:33.640
SOSA:
Okay, Agent Burress, that will be all.

01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:36.520
Let's take him out of here, guys.
Go ahead, princess.

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:43.879
MURDOCK: What's the difference between
a concussion and a contusion?

01:42:44.879 --> 01:42:47.319
-It don't matter, bro. You tore up.
-FACE: Murdock, that was beautiful.

01:42:47.439 --> 01:42:48.879
You were right. The helmet worked.

01:42:49.039 --> 01:42:50.879
Ketchup worked great.

01:42:53.839 --> 01:42:54.879
-Yeah.
-FACE: Got your bell rung?

you all with escaping lawful custody.

What? Hannibal,
what is this guy talking about?

01:45:00.551 --> 01:45:04.031
B.A., we were wrongly convicted,
but it's still illegal to break out of jail.

Director McCready, Smith and his team

01:45:05.551 --> 01:45:06.911
were instrumental
in recovering those plates.

01:45:07.031 --> 01:45:10.911
They're still level-10 federal fugitives

This is chickenshit, sir.

Yeah, well, you know what?
Perhaps for them, it is chickenshit,

you to your former rank.

01:45:18.750 --> 01:45:19.950

here in Long Beach.

01:45:21.670 --> 01:45:23.390

-This is really unfair, sir.

-This is bullshit.
-I'm like Harry Houdini.
