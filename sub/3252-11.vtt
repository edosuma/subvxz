00:03.160 --> 00:05.110
~ Clara! ~ 'Shut up.'

00:05.160 --> 00:06.670
Is that how we communicate now?

00:06.720 --> 00:09.310
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
I need to talk to you.

00:09.360 --> 00:11.430
Well, I'll be there in a
couple of minutes, so...

00:11.480 --> 00:14.310
~ No, not while you're in the room.
~ Oh, stupid me. The very idea!

00:14.360 --> 00:17.030
~ Shut up! ~ 'OK.' ~ Stay shut up.

00:17.080 --> 00:18.350
OK.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.790
Things to say. Not all of them good.

00:20.840 --> 00:22.950
Oh, wouldn't it be better
if I was actually there?

00:23.000 --> 00:26.150
Danny, everything is better
when you're here, but maybe...

00:26.200 --> 00:28.230
Maybe not this.

00:28.280 --> 00:30.400
OK.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.870
Um...

00:38.920 --> 00:40.750
OK, before all of that.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.560
Before all of the stuff
that I did wrong...

00:48.160 --> 00:50.510
~ I love you. ~ I love you.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.750
'No, not like that.
Not like it's automatic.'

00:52.800 --> 00:54.550
Not like it's how you end
the phone call,

00:54.600 --> 00:56.670
~ the sign off, the pat on the back.
~ Clara...

00:56.720 --> 00:59.590
Danny, I'll never say those words
again. Not to anybody else, ever.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.320
Those words, from me, are yours now.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.200
So, erm...

01:16.800 --> 01:18.390
That's a thing.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.480
OK, Danny?

01:25.480 --> 01:27.750
Um, there's more

01:27.800 --> 01:29.470
but that's kind of the headline.

01:29.520 --> 01:32.800
OK, Danny, please speak to me,
This is, this is killing me.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.950
Danny, I love you.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.880
And you are the last person who's
ever going to hear me say that.

01:44.920 --> 01:46.350
'Hello?

01:46.400 --> 01:48.470
'Hello, is someone there?'

01:48.520 --> 01:51.350
Hello? Er, yeah, who's this?

01:51.400 --> 01:54.270
'I just picked up the phone,
I'm sorry. I found it.

01:54.320 --> 01:56.870
Oh. Um, OK. Er...

01:56.920 --> 01:59.230
Can you please just put me
back on the phone to Danny?

01:59.280 --> 02:00.870
I was talking to Danny.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.160
'I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.'

02:04.840 --> 02:06.350
OK, what are you sorry about?

02:06.400 --> 02:08.389
Could you please just pass
the phone back to...?

02:08.440 --> 02:09.830
'He was crossing the road.

02:09.880 --> 02:13.350
'I found the phone,
it must have just got thrown...

02:13.400 --> 02:16.150
'The car, it just came out
of nowhere.'

02:16.200 --> 02:18.150
I'm so sorry.

02:53.280 --> 02:55.470
'By now, I'm sure you've heard
the rumours

02:55.520 --> 02:59.230
'and it is with great sadness that
I must confirm them to be true.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.270
'I have gathered you all here
today to say that Mr Pink,

03:02.320 --> 03:05.870
'that Danny Pink has
sadly passed away.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.590
'I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing his family and friends

03:08.640 --> 03:10.870
'our sincerest condolences.

03:10.920 --> 03:13.710
'Mr Pink was an inspiration
to all of those who knew him.

03:13.760 --> 03:17.190
'A soldier, a teacher, a friend.

03:17.240 --> 03:20.510
'It was no secret that he had a
close relationship with Miss Oswald.

03:20.560 --> 03:23.310
'And our thoughts and prayers
are with her too.'

03:39.840 --> 03:42.280
Hello, love. You all right?

03:45.920 --> 03:47.400
Of course you're not.

03:48.480 --> 03:52.910
Sorry. Of course
you're not all right.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.390
You know what you should do?

03:55.440 --> 03:57.880
You should cry. Let go.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.600
Of what?

04:02.400 --> 04:06.590
It's a terrible thing. Just a
terrible, terrible thing.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.230
It wasn't terrible.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.830
Clara?

04:09.880 --> 04:11.750
It was boring.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.640
Boring?

04:15.200 --> 04:16.670
It was ordinary.

04:21.760 --> 04:24.750
People just kept walking with
their iPods and their shopping bags.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.990
He was alive, then he was dead
and it was nothing.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.550
Like stepping off a bus.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.350
He deserved better. And so did you.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.950
I don't deserve anything.
Nobody deserves anything.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.560
But I am owed better.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.790
I am owed.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.470
Who owes you?

04:45.520 --> 04:47.830
'Clara!

04:47.880 --> 04:49.560
'Clara?'

04:52.320 --> 04:53.550
Hey!

04:53.600 --> 04:55.310
Sorry, I was busy. What's happening?

04:55.360 --> 04:57.710
Oh, nothing. You know, same old,
same old.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.190
Well, you're only human.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.240
'So what I can do for you, Clara?'

06:04.080 --> 06:05.800
Clara?

06:09.520 --> 06:11.790
~ Start her up! ~ Where are we going?
~ Away.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.270
~ From? ~ Just away.

06:13.320 --> 06:17.150
Well, normally you say work or
kids or dishes or dullness.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.230
So what's happened?

06:19.280 --> 06:21.590
~ A volcano. ~ I'm sorry?

06:21.640 --> 06:24.150
I've never seen an active
volcano, do you know one?

06:24.200 --> 06:26.070
What's so great about
seeing a volcano?

06:26.120 --> 06:29.360
~ It's just a sort of leaky mountain.
~ I've never seen lava.

06:32.520 --> 06:33.990
It's rubbish.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.640
Prove it.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.440
It's on your neck.

06:50.400 --> 06:53.230
Do you still have those
sleep patch things?

06:53.280 --> 06:55.630
~ You can't have one.
~ I'm having trouble sleeping.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.070
~ You still can't have one.
~ Can I have one?

06:58.120 --> 06:59.760
No, you can't have one.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.910
So, volcano.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.360
What's so good about lava?

07:26.680 --> 07:29.960
You told me once what it would
take to destroy a TARDIS key.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.920
That's what's so good about lava.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.920
All seven. From all of
your hiding places.

07:45.080 --> 07:46.630
Clara, what are you doing?

07:46.680 --> 07:49.640
Don't. Be very, very careful with
that. Those are very, very...

07:55.240 --> 07:57.510
Do I have your attention?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.950
~ Yes. ~ Good.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.480
No. Not good, Clara.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.800
Danny Pink.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.750
Yeah?

08:09.800 --> 08:11.360
Is dead.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.150
And?

08:16.200 --> 08:18.680
~ Seriously? ~ And?

08:20.240 --> 08:21.720
And fix it.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.040
Change it.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.880
Change what happened, save him.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.000
Bring him back.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.000
No.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.470
Five left.

08:50.520 --> 08:53.110
Every time you say no to me, I will
throw another key down there.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.110
Do we understand each other?

08:55.160 --> 08:57.430
Well, I understand you,
let's not get carried away.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.270
Time can be rewritten.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.350
With precision.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.000
With great care.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.750
And not today.

09:05.800 --> 09:06.950
But you know that of course

09:07.000 --> 09:10.150
otherwise you wouldn't
be threatening me.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.830
Did you just say no?

09:11.880 --> 09:13.910
If I...

09:13.960 --> 09:16.510
change the events
that brought you here,

09:16.560 --> 09:20.550
you will never come here and
ask me to change those events.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.040
Paradox loop.

09:23.280 --> 09:26.360
The timeline disintegrates.
Your timeline. And yes!

09:28.520 --> 09:30.400
~ Yes? ~ Yes...

09:31.680 --> 09:33.320
.. I did just say no.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.190
Throw away the key.

09:36.240 --> 09:40.870
I have seen you change time, I have
seen you break any rule you want.

09:40.920 --> 09:43.230
I know when I can, I know
when I can't. Throw the key.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.630
I know what you're doing.
You're trying to take control.

09:45.680 --> 09:49.190
~ I am in control. Throw away the key,
do as you are told. ~ No!

09:49.240 --> 09:52.190
Well, either you do as you're told
or stop threatening me.

09:52.240 --> 09:55.510
There really isn't
a third option here.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.640
Do you know what, Doctor?

09:59.400 --> 10:01.870
When it comes to taking control,

10:01.920 --> 10:03.800
you really are out of your depth.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.470
One last chance.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.750
And I don't care about the rules,

10:13.800 --> 10:16.750
I don't give a damn about paradoxes.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.520
Save Danny, bring him back
or I swear...

10:22.360 --> 10:24.590
.. you will never step inside
your TARDIS again.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.270
~ No. ~ Do as you are told.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.760
~ No. ~ Say it again so I know
you mean it. ~ No!

10:31.440 --> 10:33.990
~ I'm not kidding, Doctor...
~ Neither am I. ~ .. I will do it!

10:34.040 --> 10:36.320
Clara, my Clara,
I don't think you will!

10:56.320 --> 10:59.390
Oh, I'd say I'm sorry
but I'd do it again.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.710
I'd do it again.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.270
Well, what are you doing?
Why are you just standing there?

11:07.320 --> 11:09.800
Do you understand
what I have just done?

11:15.600 --> 11:17.990
~ Look in your hand.
~ There's nothing in my hand.

11:18.040 --> 11:20.950
~ Clara, look in your hand. ~ The keys,
they're gone. They're down there.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.390
~ Clara, look in your hand.
~ There's nothing in my hand.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.400
Yes, yes, yes, there is, look.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.920
Did you seriously think that
that was going to work on me?

11:45.120 --> 11:47.750
They're not sleep patches.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.320
They induce a dream state.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.720
Makes you very suggestible.

11:59.080 --> 12:03.880
I allowed the whole scenario
to play out just as you planned.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.320
I was curious about how far
you would go.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.390
~ Well, now you know.
~ Yeah...

12:13.440 --> 12:15.040
now I know.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.350
I love him.

12:21.160 --> 12:23.760
Yes, you're quite the mess
of chemicals, aren't you?

12:27.720 --> 12:29.480
So, what now?

12:31.800 --> 12:34.400
What do we do now? You and me,
what happens now?

12:38.160 --> 12:39.920
Doctor?

12:43.080 --> 12:44.440
Go to hell.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.840
Fair enough.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.440
Absolutely fair enough.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.960
Clara?

13:07.080 --> 13:10.430
You asked me what we're going to do.
I told you.

13:10.480 --> 13:12.550
We're going to hell.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.790
Or wherever it is people go
when they die. If there is anywhere.

13:15.840 --> 13:19.520
Wherever it is, we're going to go
there and we're going to find Danny.

13:22.280 --> 13:26.200
And if it is in any way possible,
we're going to bring him home.

13:29.040 --> 13:33.590
Almost every culture in the universe
has some concept of an afterlife.

13:33.640 --> 13:37.200
I always meant to have a look
around, see if I could find one.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.230
~ You're going to help me?
~ Well, why wouldn't I help you?

13:41.280 --> 13:44.200
~ Cos of what I just did. I just...
~ You betrayed me.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.070
Betrayed my trust,
you betrayed our friendship,

13:48.120 --> 13:51.640
you betrayed everything that I've
ever stood for. You let me down!

13:53.240 --> 13:55.280
Then why are you helping me?

13:56.800 --> 13:58.200
Why?

14:01.640 --> 14:03.830
Do you think I care for you
so little that betraying me

14:03.880 --> 14:05.800
would make a difference?

14:09.160 --> 14:11.670
Stop it with the eyes.
Don't do that with the eyes.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.520
How do you do that anyway?
It's like they inflate!

14:21.960 --> 14:24.240
Cut out the whining
while you're at it.

14:25.360 --> 14:28.230
We've got work to do. This is it,
Clara, one of those moments.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.790
~ What moments? ~ The darkest day.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.950
The blackest hour.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.150
Chin up, shoulders back.
Let's see what we're made of,

14:36.200 --> 14:38.160
you and I.

14:45.320 --> 14:48.550
Switching off the safeguards,
turning off the nav-com.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.950
Remember, we did this before.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.270
We plugged you into the
TARDIS telepathic interface.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.070
We ended up all over
Danny's timestream.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.150
Because you and he are linked,
strongly linked.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.710
Your timestreams are intertwined.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.630
So if he's anywhere at all, that
link will hold. Give me your hands.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.750
~ Doctor... ~ We're in a hurry.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.230
I don't deserve a friend like you.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.080
Clara, I'm terribly sorry but
I'm exactly what you deserve.

15:09.600 --> 15:13.030
Think about Danny. Think about
the man you lost.

15:13.080 --> 15:16.360
Let it hurt. Let it burn.
But don't bleat.

15:18.080 --> 15:22.030
Don't ask, why him? Why me? Forget
all that. Ask one question.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.310
Just one.

15:23.360 --> 15:26.840
Ask, where is Danny Pink now?
Where is he now?

15:41.800 --> 15:43.870
Well...

15:43.920 --> 15:46.120
the TARDIS thinks he's somewhere.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.470
Has anyone offered you a coffee?

16:07.520 --> 16:09.350
Um...

16:09.400 --> 16:11.350
Well, no.

16:11.400 --> 16:14.150
Could we have some coffee
along here, please?

16:14.200 --> 16:16.720
The good kind. We've got a new one.

16:18.840 --> 16:22.710
Five minutes, tops. Best to wait
for the good coffee.

16:22.760 --> 16:25.790
~ Where am I? ~ Sometimes it's
just the instant, oh...

16:25.840 --> 16:27.310
Where am I?

16:27.360 --> 16:29.070
Well, big question.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.310
Try to take that one slowly.

16:31.360 --> 16:34.270
We have been trying
to contact family members,

16:34.320 --> 16:37.270
but really there is so much admin...

16:37.320 --> 16:39.560
I wasn't here, I was...

16:42.800 --> 16:47.150
Yeah. That last thing
that happened to you,

16:47.200 --> 16:49.790
that really happened, I'm afraid.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.070
But that's life.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.350
Well, not life, I suppose, but...

16:55.400 --> 16:58.870
There are some forms to fill in.
Might help you relax.

16:58.920 --> 17:02.830
Well, they won't, but we do
need them filled in.

17:02.880 --> 17:05.230
Right, important thing.
Need to know.

17:05.280 --> 17:08.190
Are you being cremated?

17:08.240 --> 17:11.670
Sorry, it's a fairly
urgent question.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.750
I don't know. I've never really
thought of that.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.710
I'm going to put you down
as a yes,

17:15.760 --> 17:18.109
that's pretty much
the default these days.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.869
~ If people only knew...
~ Only knew what?

17:20.920 --> 17:23.230
We've got a burner in number 12.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.710
~ Tell them to prep, please.
~ Burner?

17:25.760 --> 17:27.470
Yeah, it's fine, we'll come to that.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.440
But I don't understand where I am.

17:46.960 --> 17:49.960
Oh, look at that.
You can see my house from here.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.880
Yeah, sorry, probably not helping.

17:54.880 --> 17:56.230
Where am I?

17:56.280 --> 17:58.150
Um...

17:58.200 --> 17:59.910
You sort of know, don't you?

17:59.960 --> 18:03.630
Most people kind of know, it's just
hard to get traction on the concept.

18:03.680 --> 18:04.880
Where am I?

18:05.960 --> 18:07.590
OK. You're dead.

18:07.640 --> 18:10.390
And this is what's next.

18:10.440 --> 18:13.910
~ I'm not dead. How can I be dead?
~ Our sincere condolences.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.790
~ I'm standing right here.
~ Yes, you are.

18:16.840 --> 18:18.350
Welcome to the Underworld.

18:18.400 --> 18:22.870
Otherwise known as the Nethersphere,
or the Promised Land.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.880
It's where you go when you die.

18:37.720 --> 18:40.040
Would you like to breathe
into a bag?

18:48.560 --> 18:49.630
Where are we?

18:49.680 --> 18:52.550
Nav-com's offline. We'll have
to do this old school.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.030
But this is where Danny is?

18:54.080 --> 18:57.230
Almost certainly not. It's where
there's a connection with Danny.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.830
According to the TARDIS, this is
where it's most likely that

18:59.880 --> 19:02.990
your timeline will re-intersect
with his. And that won't do.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.750
~ What won't? ~ You won't, look at you.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.230
I need sceptical, clever, critical.
I don't need mopey.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.870
It put years on your face.
And what if people see us together?

19:09.920 --> 19:12.910
~ It looks like you've been melted.
~ Are you forgetting why we're here?

19:12.960 --> 19:15.910
We're here to get your boyfriend
back from the dead,

19:15.960 --> 19:18.160
so buck up and
give me some attitude.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.950
Fish tanks?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.720
In a mausoleum?

20:01.480 --> 20:05.240
~ What does that mean? ~ It means those
are definitely not fish tanks.

20:18.360 --> 20:20.440
~ Why? ~ I don't know.

20:30.320 --> 20:33.440
OK, I'm assuming they didn't
actually drown in there.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.550
No.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.880
They were placed, after death.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.040
These are tombs.

20:45.440 --> 20:48.710
Water tombs, some sort of
fluid, anyway.

20:48.760 --> 20:51.070
~ With chairs? ~ With chairs, yes.

20:51.120 --> 20:54.400
Extra comfort for the deceased,
it pays to die rich.

20:59.120 --> 21:00.480
Oh, God.

21:05.080 --> 21:07.910
Am I going to find Danny now? Is
that why the TARDIS brought us here?

21:07.960 --> 21:10.190
~ I don't want to see him like that.
~ Good point.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.630
Tombs with windows. Who wants to
watch their loved ones rot?

21:13.680 --> 21:17.510
Why would anyone go to
so much trouble...

21:17.560 --> 21:19.960
just to keep watch on the dead?

21:37.200 --> 21:39.110
'3W.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.750
'Death is not an end.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.870
'But we can we help with that.

21:43.920 --> 21:48.430
'Ever since 3W encountered the truth
about the death experience,

21:48.480 --> 21:52.310
'we have been working hard to find
a better life for the deceased.

21:52.360 --> 21:56.280
'At 3W, afterlife means aftercare.'

21:58.240 --> 22:00.750
OK. Bit strange?

22:00.800 --> 22:02.150
Very.

22:02.200 --> 22:05.030
Why have the scrolling and a voice?

22:05.080 --> 22:07.110
Is it difficult?

22:07.160 --> 22:08.390
Is what difficult?

22:08.440 --> 22:10.680
Reading all those words
back to front.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.360
Come on. We've come a long way.

22:19.160 --> 22:22.390
Hello. I hope you're well.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.830
How may I assist you with your death?

22:24.880 --> 22:27.910
Well, there is, er,
no immediate hurry.

22:27.960 --> 22:30.270
We're just, er...

22:30.320 --> 22:32.710
We're just... Er...

22:32.760 --> 22:35.550
~ Browsing. ~ Yeah, yeah, browsing.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.750
Please, take all the time you need.

22:38.800 --> 22:43.030
At 3W, you always have
the rest of your life.

22:43.080 --> 22:46.510
~ Oh, good. That's good to know,
Clara, isn't it? ~ Yeah. Great.

22:46.560 --> 22:49.350
~ Exactly what is 3W? ~ Apologies.

22:49.400 --> 22:53.350
Clearly you have not received the
official 3W greetings package.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.880
Well, you know, it's just
an unexpected...

23:16.960 --> 23:19.400
Welcome to the 3W Institute.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.750
Clara...

23:22.800 --> 23:24.200
is it over now?

23:25.520 --> 23:27.350
I think it's over, yeah.

23:27.400 --> 23:30.310
You also have not received
the official welcome package.

23:30.360 --> 23:33.030
Oh, I'm good. Thanks, no worries.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.510
Who are you?

23:34.560 --> 23:36.630
~ I am Missy. ~ Missy?

23:36.680 --> 23:39.070
Mobile Intelligent Systems Interface.

23:39.120 --> 23:42.430
I am a multi-function,
interactive welcome-droid.

23:42.480 --> 23:45.520
Helping you to help me to help you.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.750
You're very...

23:50.800 --> 23:53.550
~ realistic. ~ Tongues? ~ Shut up.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.390
I am fully programmed with
social interaction norms

23:56.440 --> 23:58.470
appropriate to a range of visitors.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.790
Please indicate if you'd like me
to adjust my intimacy setting.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.550
Oh, yes, please. Please do that,
do that now right now.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.230
Maybe just a tad, yeah.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.710
I need to speak to
whoever's in charge here.

24:09.760 --> 24:11.350
I am in charge.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.190
Well, who's in charge of you?

24:13.240 --> 24:14.550
I'm in charge of me.

24:14.600 --> 24:17.070
Well, who repairs you?
Who maintains you?

24:17.120 --> 24:21.320
I am programmed for self-repair.
I am maintained by my heart.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.120
Is everything in order?

24:28.960 --> 24:31.030
Who maintains your heart?

24:31.080 --> 24:34.320
My heart is maintained
by the Doctor.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.560
Doctor who?

24:38.960 --> 24:40.640
Dr Chang!

24:42.600 --> 24:44.440
Who's there?

24:46.600 --> 24:47.870
Hello?

24:47.920 --> 24:49.710
Hello.

24:49.760 --> 24:52.390
Hello.

24:52.440 --> 24:55.240
You can probably take your
hand down now, Doctor.

25:00.360 --> 25:01.990
So. Hey.

25:02.040 --> 25:03.590
Condolences!

25:03.640 --> 25:07.190
~ Condolences? ~ It's a mausoleum.
It's our hello.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.760
Is there a particular dead person
you want to talk to?

25:12.880 --> 25:14.630
Yes.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.070
Yes, there is.

25:16.120 --> 25:17.950
This way then.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.040
~ Are you OK? ~ No.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.880
Good. There would be something
very wrong if you were.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.590
Bit of fresh air. Do you good.

25:55.640 --> 25:58.990
~ Why's it so cold here? ~ And the Wi-Fi
is better out here. Don't know why.

25:59.040 --> 26:02.630
~ Wi-Fi? ~ Yeah, still a bit spotty,
but basically...

26:02.680 --> 26:04.470
You have Wi-Fi here?

26:04.520 --> 26:07.910
You... You have iPads
in the afterlife?

26:07.960 --> 26:10.760
IPads? We have Steve Jobs!

26:12.560 --> 26:15.630
Listen, another big question
for you.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.320
Have you ever killed anybody?

26:22.480 --> 26:24.360
This is surreal.

26:28.080 --> 26:30.310
Imagine embryos had telephones.

26:30.360 --> 26:33.870
~ That's really not helping.
~ Go with me. Go with me.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.870
Imagine babies in wombs could talk
to other babies in other wombs.

26:36.920 --> 26:38.230
What would they say?

26:38.280 --> 26:42.030
What would they think life was like
if they could talk among themselves?

26:42.080 --> 26:43.750
I really have no idea.

26:43.800 --> 26:46.150
They'd think that life was
nine months long.

26:46.200 --> 26:50.550
Then, boom, trap door opens,
out you fall, gone for ever.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.390
Never hear from those guys again.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.550
Nothing at the end of the cord.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.470
OK.

26:56.520 --> 26:59.230
This isn't really an afterlife.

26:59.280 --> 27:02.320
It's just more life
than you were expecting.

27:04.720 --> 27:06.870
Why did you ask me
if I'd killed anyone?

27:06.920 --> 27:10.870
Before you were a teacher,
you spent some time as a soldier.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.470
Yeah, so?

27:12.520 --> 27:15.910
Any regrets? Bad memories?

27:15.960 --> 27:17.910
Is that any of your business?

27:17.960 --> 27:19.310
Yes.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.600
Get to cover, now!

27:26.320 --> 27:28.430
Sorry if I triggered something then.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.800
Memory flashes can be very impactful
in the early stages.

27:32.920 --> 27:34.510
Why?

27:34.560 --> 27:36.080
Why what?

27:44.040 --> 27:45.990
'Why is it any of your business?'

27:46.040 --> 27:49.150
We've had a request to meet you.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.760
Any idea who that would be from?

27:59.960 --> 28:02.670
It's been given a priority,
which usually means...

28:02.720 --> 28:04.120
Means what?

28:05.840 --> 28:09.080
Well, anyway, we've arranged
a meet-up.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.470
When?

28:12.520 --> 28:14.200
Come in.

28:22.920 --> 28:25.910
'Danny, repeat, is
the building secure?'

28:25.960 --> 28:28.310
So, I guess you remember him, yeah?

28:28.360 --> 28:30.230
'Danny? Danny?'

28:35.240 --> 28:36.960
Come in, come in.

28:38.600 --> 28:41.790
~ Going to need to take
a reading off you. ~ A reading?

28:41.840 --> 28:44.270
~ Won't hurt. ~ What won't?

28:44.320 --> 28:46.990
How does the body
keep its integrity?

28:47.040 --> 28:49.390
Why isn't it just a bunch
of bones floating about?

28:49.440 --> 28:52.750
Each body is encased in
a support exoskeleton.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.350
'An invisible exoskeleton?'

28:54.400 --> 28:57.350
'It's only invisible in the water.
There's a specially engineered

28:57.400 --> 29:00.430
'refraction index in the fluid
so we can see the tank resident

29:00.480 --> 29:02.590
'unimpeded by the
support mechanisms.'

29:02.640 --> 29:05.640
'So each skeleton is
inside something?'

29:14.120 --> 29:17.000
~ Are you serious? X-ray water?
~ It's so cool.

29:18.080 --> 29:19.400
Look at this.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.760
We call it dark water.

29:29.320 --> 29:32.320
Only organic matter
can be seen through it.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.830
I keep saying they should use
this stuff in swimming pools.

29:38.880 --> 29:41.830
~ Why? ~ Think about it.

29:41.880 --> 29:44.000
I am thinking about it. Why?

29:45.800 --> 29:46.910
Doesn't matter.

29:46.960 --> 29:49.390
3W, what kind of name is that?
What does it mean?

29:49.440 --> 29:50.990
Well, you know, don't you?

29:51.040 --> 29:54.200
You're here on business or
they wouldn't have let you in.

29:56.960 --> 29:59.070
Sorry. Should have checked.
Who are you?

29:59.120 --> 30:00.830
I thought that you would never ask.

30:00.880 --> 30:04.400
Sort out your security protocols,
they're a disgrace.

30:06.560 --> 30:08.590
Another government inspection?

30:08.640 --> 30:10.350
So soon?

30:10.400 --> 30:11.830
Why is there all this swearing?

30:11.880 --> 30:15.830
Oh, I've got a lot of
internalised anger.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.310
What does 3W stand for?

30:18.360 --> 30:20.310
Well, the three words.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.390
What three words?

30:22.440 --> 30:25.510
~ Seriously? You don't know? ~ Never mind
what we know and what we don't know,

30:25.560 --> 30:27.110
just answer our question.

30:27.160 --> 30:29.790
Because people who don't know,
when they hear about this,

30:29.840 --> 30:33.110
~ they can freak out.
~ We're not going to freak out.

30:33.160 --> 30:36.080
If you've had a recent loss,
this might be...

30:37.280 --> 30:39.400
This will be disturbing.

30:40.840 --> 30:44.750
~ She'll be fine. ~ Speak for me again,
I'll detach something from you.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.000
I'll be fine.

30:48.600 --> 30:52.630
You know how people are scared
of dying? Like, everybody.

30:52.680 --> 30:55.990
Of course, it's the most fundamental
fear in the universe.

30:56.040 --> 30:59.240
They'd be a lot more scared if they
knew what it was really like.

31:07.120 --> 31:08.800
So...

31:10.480 --> 31:12.400
You OK?

31:16.520 --> 31:18.000
I'm sorry.

31:19.560 --> 31:21.030
I just...

31:21.080 --> 31:23.750
Hey, hey... Hey, listen.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.550
Listen...

31:25.600 --> 31:27.390
Hey!

31:27.440 --> 31:29.120
Probably best not, eh?

31:32.360 --> 31:35.070
Doesn't speak much.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.870
Why would he want to see me?

31:39.520 --> 31:40.910
What the hell is that?

31:40.960 --> 31:44.350
Sounds like somebody
left their body to science.

31:44.400 --> 31:46.270
OK. Um...

31:46.320 --> 31:50.080
It's probably time to explain
why you're always feeling cold...

31:53.160 --> 31:56.790
White noise off the telly.
We've all heard it.

31:56.840 --> 32:00.870
A few years ago, Dr Skarosa,
our founder,

32:00.920 --> 32:03.320
did something unexpected.

32:04.320 --> 32:06.590
He played that noise through
a translation matrix

32:06.640 --> 32:08.590
of his own devising.

32:08.640 --> 32:11.160
This is a recording of what he heard.

32:17.440 --> 32:20.670
~ OK. People. Voices. ~ So what?

32:20.720 --> 32:23.030
Over time, Dr Skarosa
became convinced

32:23.080 --> 32:26.350
these were the voices of
the recently departed.

32:26.400 --> 32:29.560
He believed it was a telepathic
communication from the dead.

32:33.440 --> 32:35.310
Why?

32:35.360 --> 32:36.710
Was he an idiot?

32:36.760 --> 32:40.910
He was able to isolate some of the
voices, hear what they were saying.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.150
So... an idiot then.

32:43.200 --> 32:44.470
Shut up, Doctor.

32:44.520 --> 32:47.110
What I'm about to play you
will change your life

32:47.160 --> 32:51.430
and not for the better. These are the
three words which caused Dr Skarosa

32:51.480 --> 32:54.070
to set up institutes, like this one,
all over the world

32:54.120 --> 32:55.670
to protect the dead.

32:55.720 --> 32:58.510
If you'd rather not hear these
words, there's still time...

32:58.560 --> 33:01.080
Can you just hurry up, please?
Or I'll hit you with my shoe.

33:05.520 --> 33:08.830
'Don't cremate me.
Don't cremate me!'

33:08.880 --> 33:13.590
There is one simple, horrible
possibility that has never occurred

33:13.640 --> 33:16.150
to anyone throughout human history.

33:16.200 --> 33:18.870
'Don't cremate me.
Don't cremate me!'

33:18.920 --> 33:20.750
Don't say it.

33:20.800 --> 33:22.670
The dead remain conscious.

33:22.720 --> 33:26.550
The dead are fully aware of
everything that is happening to them.

33:26.600 --> 33:30.350
So your mind is here, your soul,
whatever you want to call it

33:30.400 --> 33:33.790
and you're in your new body
in your new world.

33:33.840 --> 33:37.470
But you're still connected to
your old body in the old world.

33:37.520 --> 33:41.190
You're still going
to feel what it feels.

33:41.240 --> 33:43.790
That's why I'm cold.

33:43.840 --> 33:46.960
They're keeping you
in a cold place, yeah.

33:48.920 --> 33:53.710
You did say you were being cremated?

33:55.400 --> 33:57.590
Sorry, I'll get this.

33:57.640 --> 34:01.550
~ Sorry. Sorry, are you telling me...?
~ Wow! Oh, that's rare.

34:01.600 --> 34:02.710
This never happens.

34:02.760 --> 34:05.150
~ Wow, what now? What never happens?
~ You've got a call.

34:05.200 --> 34:08.030
~ A call? ~ From the other side. ~ Meaning?

34:08.080 --> 34:11.239
Do you know somebody called
Clara Oswald?

34:13.199 --> 34:15.389
Fakery. All of it.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.989
It's a con, it's a racket!

34:18.040 --> 34:19.920
I promise you this is not a con.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.630
What's that beeping?

34:22.679 --> 34:25.030
'Never mind about beeping,
who cares about beeping?

34:25.080 --> 34:26.230
'The dead are dead!

34:26.280 --> 34:28.750
'They're not talking to you
out of your television sets.

34:28.800 --> 34:33.030
'They're just gone and all these
poor souls down there in these tanks

34:33.080 --> 34:36.719
'I'm sorry, but they're just dead
and they're not coming back.'

34:40.920 --> 34:42.909
'Clara? Clara?

34:42.960 --> 34:44.320
'Clara, are you there?'

34:47.080 --> 34:48.870
Danny!

34:48.920 --> 34:52.630
I can hear you. Is that you?
Oh, please, say it's you.

34:52.679 --> 34:54.550
That's her, that's Clara!

34:54.600 --> 34:57.760
Yeah, you're really lucky,
it hardly ever happens.

35:00.320 --> 35:01.990
Where did she go?

35:02.040 --> 35:04.310
Ah.

35:04.360 --> 35:05.870
Hm. Er...

35:05.920 --> 35:09.270
Just lost the signal, but I can
track it back, I'm pretty sure...

35:09.320 --> 35:11.310
I don't understand.
What is happening?

35:11.360 --> 35:13.870
We've been scanning you
telepathically since you came in.

35:13.920 --> 35:16.270
You said you wanted to speak
to someone who'd passed.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.430
And we've found you a match
in the Nethersphere.

35:18.480 --> 35:21.280
This isn't possible.
The dead don't come back.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.190
~ Come on, get her back. ~ Da-da-da!

35:26.240 --> 35:27.640
I'm trying.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.390
It was him, it was his voice.

35:30.440 --> 35:33.590
If they scanned you telepathically,
they could've lifted a voice print,

35:33.640 --> 35:35.070
it could still be a fake.

35:35.120 --> 35:37.400
Getting him back - very nearly!

35:39.640 --> 35:40.950
Clara, can you hear me?

35:41.000 --> 35:43.990
Yes, Danny, I can hear you.
Can you hear me?

35:44.040 --> 35:47.630
Yeah, yeah, I can hear you.
Clara! Oh, God.

35:47.680 --> 35:49.630
~ Clara... ~ What do I do?

35:49.680 --> 35:52.710
~ Who are you talking to? ~ Hang on
just a moment. ~ Question him.

35:52.760 --> 35:55.230
Ask him questions only he'd know
the answer to. Be sure.

35:55.280 --> 35:58.950
~ You - with me. ~ Where are you going?
~ I've got to check out those tanks.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.550
There's something that I'm missing.

36:00.600 --> 36:02.070
'Clara?'

36:02.120 --> 36:04.350
Sceptical and critical, remember?

36:04.400 --> 36:07.470
Be strong - even if it
breaks your heart.

36:07.520 --> 36:10.310
Connection's stabilised,
it should be OK.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.270
Who would harvest dead bodies?

36:12.320 --> 36:15.880
I feel like I'm missing
something obvious.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.670
Danny?

36:24.720 --> 36:27.030
Yeah, I'm here.

36:27.080 --> 36:30.310
Danny, I'm so sorry but I'm going
to have to ask you some questions.

36:30.360 --> 36:33.040
Questions? I swear on
anything it's me!

36:35.120 --> 36:38.920
Humankind, bring out your dead.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.310
Oh, my God!

37:02.360 --> 37:04.750
The tanks...
The tanks are activating!

37:04.800 --> 37:07.750
~ They're not supposed to do that. ~ And
all your dead people are standing.

37:07.800 --> 37:11.670
~ Don't you think you skipped
the headline? ~ Now, now, children.

37:11.720 --> 37:14.110
Naughty, naughty!

37:14.160 --> 37:15.950
Dr Chang...

37:16.000 --> 37:18.190
your welcome droid
has developed a fault.

37:18.240 --> 37:21.390
That's not a droid. That's my boss.

37:21.440 --> 37:25.680
You know I might have been guilty
of a just teensy, little fibette.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.710
Dr Chang...

37:29.760 --> 37:32.270
I really liked working with you.

37:32.320 --> 37:35.070
~ I've enjoyed every day of it.
~ I'm sorry?

37:35.120 --> 37:40.030
You know, I've even got a little
photograph of you looking so sweet.

37:40.080 --> 37:42.320
I'm always going to keep it. Always!

37:44.920 --> 37:47.670
~ Are you going to kill me?
~ Now, come on.

37:47.720 --> 37:49.990
Let's not dwell on horrid things.

37:50.040 --> 37:52.390
This is going to be
our last conversation

37:52.440 --> 37:55.390
and I'm the one who's going
to have to live with that.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.800
Please don't kill me.

37:58.520 --> 37:59.990
Say something nice.

38:00.040 --> 38:03.040
Please, please. I...
I don't want to die.

38:04.880 --> 38:06.510
You're going to kill me, aren't you?

38:06.560 --> 38:08.800
~ Say something nice. ~ Please!

38:10.080 --> 38:13.550
Dr Chang, I've got all day

38:13.600 --> 38:17.960
and I'm not going to kill you
until you say something nice.

38:19.040 --> 38:22.030
It has been an absolute pleasure
working with you and I truly believe

38:22.080 --> 38:25.560
that you'll never be able to
find it in your heart to murder me.

38:29.080 --> 38:31.390
Now, I'll be with you in a moment.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.270
Just...

38:33.320 --> 38:35.880
feeling a bit emotional
at the moment.

38:38.040 --> 38:39.560
Cybermen!

38:42.880 --> 38:45.950
It's me. I... I swear on anything
it's me.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.470
'The very first restaurant
you took me to - that first date.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.830
~ 'What was it called?'
~ Clara, it's me.

38:50.880 --> 38:53.750
Then what was the name
of the restaurant?

38:53.800 --> 38:55.070
What was it?

38:55.120 --> 38:56.680
I can't remember!

38:58.760 --> 39:01.630
They're Cybermen, all of them,
we've got to stop them getting out.

39:01.680 --> 39:03.150
Now who's missing the headline?

39:03.200 --> 39:04.670
The Nethersphere.

39:04.720 --> 39:07.550
You know it's ever so funny,
the people that live inside that

39:07.600 --> 39:09.680
think they've gone to heaven.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.830
'My birthday. When is it?'

39:12.880 --> 39:15.470
November 23rd. That's right,
isn't it? I got that one right.

39:15.520 --> 39:18.430
'It's pretty basic information.

39:18.480 --> 39:21.590
'Anyone could know that.
Say something only you could say.'

39:21.640 --> 39:23.920
Tell me something only
Danny would know.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.670
That's a matrix data-slice.

39:29.720 --> 39:31.390
A Gallifreyan hard drive.

39:31.440 --> 39:33.310
Time Lord technology.

39:33.360 --> 39:36.670
Imagine you could upload
dying minds to that.

39:36.720 --> 39:39.070
Edit them. Rearrange them.

39:39.120 --> 39:41.470
Get rid of all those
boring emotions.

39:41.520 --> 39:43.390
Ready to be re-downloaded.

39:43.440 --> 39:46.040
Meanwhile, you upgrade the bodies.

39:47.520 --> 39:50.870
Upload the mind, upgrade the body.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.560
Cybermen from cyberspace.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.070
Now, why has no-one ever thought
of that before?

39:57.120 --> 39:59.760
How did you get hold of
Time Lord technology?

40:01.120 --> 40:02.510
Who are you?

40:02.560 --> 40:03.680
You know who I am.

40:04.920 --> 40:07.030
I told you.

40:07.080 --> 40:09.160
You felt it.

40:10.360 --> 40:12.120
Surely you did.

40:17.600 --> 40:19.350
Two hearts.

40:19.400 --> 40:21.150
And both of them yours.

40:21.200 --> 40:22.510
You're a Time Lord.

40:22.560 --> 40:26.160
Time Lady, please,
I'm old-fashioned.

40:27.160 --> 40:28.830
Which Time Lady?

40:28.880 --> 40:32.310
The one you abandoned, Doctor.
The one you left for dead.

40:32.360 --> 40:34.830
Didn't you ever think
I'd find my way back?

40:34.880 --> 40:37.270
Clara! Clara! Clara!
I've got to get Clara!

40:37.320 --> 40:39.310
Oh, Clara, Clara, Clara!

40:39.360 --> 40:41.630
You know I should shoot you
in a jealous rage.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.550
Now, wouldn't that be sexy?

40:43.600 --> 40:46.270
~ I've turned the lift off, though.
~ I presume you have stairs.

40:46.320 --> 40:48.240
Well, I'm not a Dalek.

40:58.440 --> 41:01.350
Oh, dear, Doctor.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.030
Didn't you realise where you were?

41:10.240 --> 41:12.270
~ 'I love you.' ~ No.

41:12.320 --> 41:14.510
No, no, no. I'm sorry, but no.
Anybody could say that.

41:14.560 --> 41:18.230
Anybody would know to say that. Say
something only you could tell me.

41:18.280 --> 41:20.190
Prove to me you are really Danny.

41:20.240 --> 41:22.590
~ How? ~ 'I love you means nothing
right now.'

41:22.640 --> 41:24.150
Not until I know who's talking.

41:24.200 --> 41:26.390
Say something only Danny could say.

41:26.440 --> 41:27.630
Clara...

41:27.680 --> 41:29.000
'Danny...

41:30.320 --> 41:32.630
'.. if that is you...'

41:32.680 --> 41:35.470
wherever you are, whatever it takes,

41:35.520 --> 41:37.110
'I will be with you again, I swear.'

41:37.160 --> 41:39.030
No, you won't.
You are not coming here.

41:39.080 --> 41:41.110
'Nothing will stop me,
nothing in the world,'

41:41.160 --> 41:43.670
~ as soon as I know it's you.
~ 'There is only one way to come here'

41:43.720 --> 41:46.750
~ and you are not doing that.
~ 'I'll do anything, Danny, anything.'

41:46.800 --> 41:49.950
Just... say something
only you could say.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.350
Clara, you have your life.
You have your whole life to live.

41:53.400 --> 41:54.790
You have to stay there.

41:54.840 --> 41:57.640
No. I have to be with Danny Pink.

41:59.720 --> 42:00.910
I love you.

42:00.960 --> 42:02.990
Stop saying that! Don't say that.

42:03.040 --> 42:06.160
If you say that again, I swear
I will switch this thing off.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.670
Clara...

42:10.720 --> 42:12.440
'Yes?'

42:14.520 --> 42:16.000
I love you.

42:51.560 --> 42:53.630
These emotions,

42:53.680 --> 42:56.270
they're terribly difficult.

42:56.320 --> 43:00.390
But, you know, we've got a thing
for that.

43:00.440 --> 43:05.400
We can help with all
these difficult feelings.

43:10.280 --> 43:12.280
Just press this.

43:14.680 --> 43:16.600
I'll leave you to make a decision.

43:59.120 --> 44:00.480
Doctor!

44:17.000 --> 44:19.800
Get away from here!
All of you, run!

44:22.560 --> 44:25.120
Go! Go! Get away from here!
Run away!

44:27.600 --> 44:30.270
Run, run! Get away from here
all of you, now!

44:30.320 --> 44:33.630
I'm sorry, everyone, another ranting
Scotsman in the street.

44:33.680 --> 44:37.310
~ I had no idea there was a match on.
~ Get away, go!

44:37.360 --> 44:41.480
Stop shouting, love. Stop making
a fuss, it's too late.

44:42.480 --> 44:45.560
All the graves of planet Earth
are about to give birth.

44:53.200 --> 44:56.400
You know the key strategic
weakness of the human race?

44:58.360 --> 45:00.160
The dead outnumber the living.

45:02.720 --> 45:03.950
Who are you?

45:04.000 --> 45:06.590
Oh, you know who I am.

45:06.640 --> 45:08.710
I'm Missy.

45:08.760 --> 45:10.790
Who's Missy?

45:10.840 --> 45:13.710
Please, try to keep up.

45:13.760 --> 45:15.400
Short for Mistress.

45:16.680 --> 45:17.840
Well...

45:19.080 --> 45:22.030
.. I couldn't very well
keep calling myself...

45:22.080 --> 45:24.400
the Master, now could I?
