WEBVTT

00:01.351 --> 00:03.434
You're stuffing handfuls of
cash in your bag

00:03.520 --> 00:05.766
and you're living with
your 25-year-old boyfriend.

00:05.866 --> 00:08.534
Just trust me. Trust is
something that you earn.

00:08.619 --> 00:10.753
I'm driving up to see my mom.

00:10.838 --> 00:13.205
How is she
handling your dad being out?

00:13.291 --> 00:14.840
Hi, son. You are still

00:14.875 --> 00:17.543
the same old goddamn loser!

00:17.595 --> 00:20.212
No! No!

00:23.551 --> 00:26.719
Wow, Carter, I'm impressed, the security.

00:26.804 --> 00:28.187
They found my molly. We'll find some.

00:28.222 --> 00:30.606
Vacation's over, time to get back to work.

00:30.691 --> 00:32.858
I'm in.

00:34.562 --> 00:35.811
Carter, something's wrong with Seth.

00:35.896 --> 00:37.229
No-no-no, come
on, call 911!

00:37.315 --> 00:38.530
He obviously OD'd.

00:38.566 --> 00:40.866
Come on! He's dead.

00:40.901 --> 00:43.285
If we get him off the property,
at least we're protected.

00:43.371 --> 00:45.070
Grab his legs. What're you talking about?

00:45.156 --> 00:46.455
Help me with this!

00:46.540 --> 00:48.574
All right, fine, I'll do it myself.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.603
This is so screwed up.

01:01.689 --> 01:03.322
All right, babe, you gotta relax, okay?

01:03.357 --> 01:04.406
We did everything we could.

01:04.492 --> 01:05.941
Yep. Look.

01:06.027 --> 01:08.027
He was already dead, I moved the body

01:08.079 --> 01:10.112
to protect you, to protect us.

01:10.197 --> 01:11.864
- Yeah, you said that.
- Because it's true.

01:11.916 --> 01:13.332
And now the cops have one less reason

01:13.367 --> 01:14.366
to put this on us.

01:14.418 --> 01:15.768
This is on us, Jared.

01:15.836 --> 01:19.038
No, it isn't, Carter, it was an accident.

01:19.123 --> 01:20.372
It was an accident.

01:20.458 --> 01:21.840
Then why do I feel like this?

01:21.876 --> 01:23.625
Because you're a good person.

01:23.711 --> 01:24.927
Yeah, I'm the patron saint

01:25.012 --> 01:26.261
of helping our friends
overdose, apparently.

01:26.347 --> 01:28.213
No, you had nothing to do with that, okay?

01:28.265 --> 01:29.548
We had nothing to do with that.

01:29.600 --> 01:30.883
Seth took those drugs himself.

01:30.968 --> 01:32.468
That's not the point, Jared.

01:32.553 --> 01:34.386
It is the point, people party.

01:34.472 --> 01:36.889
It is not on us.

01:39.694 --> 01:42.027
Just... hey, you just
gotta take a breath.

01:47.902 --> 01:49.118
All right, we need to make a plan for

01:49.203 --> 01:51.070
what to say if the cops have questions.

01:52.873 --> 01:56.208
Well, I was thinking we
would just tell the truth.

01:56.243 --> 01:59.294
Or we stick as close to
the truth as possible.

02:04.919 --> 02:06.301
All right, first they're gonna ask

02:06.387 --> 02:08.804
- if we had permits and security.
- Which we did.

02:08.889 --> 02:10.089
Then they're probably gonna wanna know

02:10.140 --> 02:12.925
if we knew how Seth got the drugs.

02:13.010 --> 02:13.926
And?

02:14.011 --> 02:15.427
Do we wanna tell him that we knew

02:15.513 --> 02:17.062
he was dealing at the party?

02:18.432 --> 02:21.233
I can't turn him in, Jared.

02:21.268 --> 02:22.401
All right, then we won't.

02:22.436 --> 02:23.852
I'll spread the word, okay?

02:23.938 --> 02:25.771
No one is gonna mention his name.

02:25.823 --> 02:27.239
You would do that?

02:27.274 --> 02:30.275
Of course. He's your brother.

02:30.361 --> 02:31.610
We got into this together.

02:31.662 --> 02:35.114
We'll get out of it together, too.

Here, do you want some water?

03:13.988 --> 03:15.821
Here.

03:17.658 --> 03:18.991
Are you hungry?

03:19.076 --> 03:22.661
Do you want...
what do you have?

03:22.713 --> 03:24.379
Um, bar food.

03:24.465 --> 03:25.380
Like what?

03:25.466 --> 03:27.666
Chips and guac. Pizza bites.

03:27.751 --> 03:30.385
Any fruit?

03:30.471 --> 03:32.004
Olives?

03:32.089 --> 03:34.807
Although I'm pretty sure
they're stuffed with blue cheese.

03:36.260 --> 03:38.811
Okay.

03:48.656 --> 03:50.072
Hey.

03:50.157 --> 03:50.939
How is she?

03:51.025 --> 03:54.076
Standard issue shell of a person.

03:54.161 --> 03:55.994
Which is actually an
improvement considering

03:56.030 --> 03:57.529
where she was two hours ago.

03:57.615 --> 03:59.698
Yeah, coming down off molly.

03:59.783 --> 04:01.750
Aspirin, water, repeat.

04:01.836 --> 04:03.035
Anything else we can do?

04:03.120 --> 04:05.003
I don't know, what do you think?

04:05.039 --> 04:07.122
Well, Pink Floyd and Diane Banks

04:07.208 --> 04:09.007
got me through my darkest hours.

04:11.512 --> 04:13.795
But I think sleep's
probably better for Bird.

04:13.881 --> 04:16.380
Sleep, right.

04:22.106 --> 04:23.438
Hey.

04:23.524 --> 04:25.691
Hey.

04:25.726 --> 04:27.392
You okay?

04:27.478 --> 04:28.560
It doesn't look good.

04:28.612 --> 04:30.562
You should see the other guy.

04:30.648 --> 04:33.532
Don't joke, Max, it's not funny.

04:33.567 --> 04:35.651
Yeah.

04:35.736 --> 04:38.237
Don't worry about me.

04:38.322 --> 04:40.239
What can I do to help?

04:40.291 --> 04:41.740
Thanks, um...

04:41.825 --> 04:43.709
Taylor's taking care of Bird.

04:43.744 --> 04:45.410
Jared's taking care of the other stuff.

04:45.462 --> 04:49.081
Who's knocking some sense
into your idiot brother?

04:49.133 --> 04:52.918
No one else knows... other than Jared.

04:52.970 --> 04:55.420
- Why are you protecting him?
- He's my brother, Max.

04:55.506 --> 04:57.556
Your mom doesn't know about
this? We're barely speaking.

04:57.591 --> 05:00.008
This can't be the first thing
I talk to her about in weeks.

05:00.094 --> 05:01.593
It's fine, I'll handle it.

05:01.645 --> 05:04.313
Jared and I have a plan.

05:05.983 --> 05:07.933
Hey, Bird's ready to head out.

05:09.069 --> 05:10.602
Not gonna outrun this.

05:10.688 --> 05:12.271
Yeah, they're for you.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.742
They're so much better with vodka.

05:16.777 --> 05:18.777
You know anything that isn't?

05:20.531 --> 05:22.364
Why did this happen?

05:22.449 --> 05:25.334
Oh... don't, no.

05:26.787 --> 05:28.337
Let's get you out of here.

05:42.219 --> 05:45.304
What, you don't answer texts anymore?

05:45.356 --> 05:47.806
I'm sorry. I just didn't know what to say.

05:47.891 --> 05:49.558
What happened? I don't know, Ben.

05:49.643 --> 05:51.026
You tell me. Tell you what?

05:51.111 --> 05:53.111
The cops came last night
when everything went down.

05:53.147 --> 05:54.780
Yeah, I'm sure, did they look for the guy

05:54.815 --> 05:56.648
who tried to sell to him?

05:56.734 --> 05:57.816
Yeah, they were.

05:57.901 --> 05:59.284
Okay, well, did they find him?

05:59.320 --> 06:01.320
Ben, I know it was you, I saw you.

06:03.157 --> 06:04.990
All right, well, you saw wrong.

06:05.075 --> 06:07.042
Oh, please, Ben, you were with him

06:07.127 --> 06:08.910
at the party, and you were dealing.

06:08.996 --> 06:10.545
Yeah, but I didn't sell to Seth.

06:10.631 --> 06:12.130
Ben. I didn't!

06:12.166 --> 06:13.966
You know what, forget
it... what's the point?

06:14.001 --> 06:15.167
You always assume the
worst about me anyway.

06:15.252 --> 06:17.502
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it is.

06:17.554 --> 06:19.421
You thought that I stole your dad's watch.

06:19.506 --> 06:20.672
Okay, yes,

06:20.724 --> 06:22.007
I did think that very briefly.

06:22.059 --> 06:23.725
But I apologized.

06:23.811 --> 06:25.510
Ben, look, I'm doing this to help you.

06:25.596 --> 06:26.561
Is that what this is?

06:26.647 --> 06:28.146
Yes, that's what this is.

06:28.182 --> 06:29.848
Maybe you're just here 'cause
you need someone else to blame,

06:29.933 --> 06:31.149
somebody other than yourself.

06:31.185 --> 06:33.402
- What?
- You threw the party, Carter.

06:33.487 --> 06:35.020
You know what goes down.

06:35.072 --> 06:37.356
This is on you as much as anyone.

06:41.078 --> 06:43.779
Yeah, so he's 20, male,
and we're definitely sure

06:43.864 --> 06:45.030
it came from the same batch.

06:45.115 --> 06:46.665
All right, well, thanks for calling me.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.200
I'll add it to my file.

06:48.285 --> 06:50.702
Yeah, right.

06:50.754 --> 06:52.204
Purple pills strike again, huh?

06:52.289 --> 06:54.456
Mm-hmm, Loudoun County this time.

06:54.541 --> 06:55.540
Loudoun County?

06:55.592 --> 06:56.675
I thought Loudoun County was

06:56.710 --> 06:58.960
all cows and... people who tip cows.

06:59.046 --> 07:00.178
Who on Earth does that?

07:00.214 --> 07:02.014
People who have nothing better to do.

07:02.049 --> 07:04.099
Probably people who take purple pills.

07:05.135 --> 07:06.601
So you think that I should be

07:06.687 --> 07:08.937
looking for cow-tippers?

07:09.023 --> 07:11.690
Oh, hey, you know what they say.

07:11.725 --> 07:15.444
Always follow the "moo" -ney.

07:15.529 --> 07:18.897
That's... "udder" -ly hysterical.

07:18.982 --> 07:22.901
Hah, that's... that's...

07:22.986 --> 07:25.654
that was... I think
that was good.

07:25.739 --> 07:27.072
It's a lousy thing to say.

07:27.124 --> 07:29.291
It's not your fault, he's deflecting.

07:29.376 --> 07:30.292
Really, Jared?

07:30.377 --> 07:32.244
I mean, we throw the parties.

07:32.329 --> 07:34.629
Remember what I taught
you about over-serving?

07:34.715 --> 07:37.082
How we can be held responsible
if someone drinks too much here.

07:37.167 --> 07:38.417
If I serve a guy ten drinks,

07:38.502 --> 07:40.969
and he crashes on his
way home, I'm responsible.

07:41.055 --> 07:42.587
Right, and you could lose the bar.

07:42.673 --> 07:43.922
But if he sneaks in a flask

07:44.007 --> 07:45.841
and then crashes on the way home,

07:45.926 --> 07:47.809
I'm not responsible.

07:47.895 --> 07:49.394
I'll feel bad like I do now,

07:49.430 --> 07:52.681
but I'm not at fault.

07:52.766 --> 07:54.066
Look, Carter,

07:54.101 --> 07:55.901
if it didn't happen at one of our parties,

07:55.936 --> 07:57.819
it was bound to happen at another one.

07:57.905 --> 07:59.237
I've been there.

07:59.273 --> 08:01.073
Don't go down that road.

08:09.783 --> 08:11.366
Sorry, we're
closed...

08:11.452 --> 08:13.335
Uh, Jared Peters, Carter Wilson?

08:13.420 --> 08:14.619
Yeah?

08:14.671 --> 08:16.037
Hi. Detective Dougherty.

08:16.123 --> 08:18.507
We're investigating the
death of Seth Blazer.

08:18.592 --> 08:21.093
Did you know him?

08:22.963 --> 08:24.963
Yeah, we know him.

08:26.383 --> 08:27.632
Knew him.

08:27.718 --> 08:29.468
Would you mind coming down
to the station with us?

08:29.553 --> 08:31.136
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

08:31.188 --> 08:33.722
Yeah, of course, anything
we can do to help.

08:33.807 --> 08:35.307
We'll wait.

08:45.038 --> 08:46.705
If we're just here to give statements,

08:46.790 --> 08:48.039
why do you have to separate us?

08:48.125 --> 08:49.658
Oh, it's for your protection.

08:49.710 --> 08:52.794
So we don't get confused
about who said what.

08:52.830 --> 08:56.081
So how long have you been
running these parties?

08:56.166 --> 08:58.466
Um, a couple of months?

08:58.502 --> 09:01.169
And in that time, you've done, like,

09:01.221 --> 09:03.388
five or six of 'em?

09:03.473 --> 09:04.840
Any other drug-related incidents?

09:04.925 --> 09:06.391
No, not that I know about.

09:06.476 --> 09:09.511
So there weren't any, or
you just didn't wanna know?

09:10.981 --> 09:12.597
I don't understand what the question is.

09:12.683 --> 09:14.850
Let's go back to last night.

09:14.902 --> 09:17.185
Did you know that drugs
were present at the party?

09:17.237 --> 09:19.604
No, not until the incident.

09:19.690 --> 09:22.023
You think your friend in the
next room will confirm that?

09:22.109 --> 09:23.158
Yeah, I know he will.

09:23.193 --> 09:24.576
We hired security.

09:24.661 --> 09:26.411
Five guys from a service.

09:26.496 --> 09:28.947
Then how did Seth Blazer
get drugs into the party?

09:29.032 --> 09:31.700
I wish I knew.

09:36.957 --> 09:38.673
Well...

09:38.709 --> 09:41.209
your friend says he knows some things.

09:41.261 --> 09:43.261
He said the party was your idea,

09:43.347 --> 09:45.764
and that you knew drugs were being sold.

09:47.184 --> 09:48.967
I don't believe you, where is he?

09:49.052 --> 09:50.969
He's obviously saving his own skin.

09:51.054 --> 09:53.054
Don't you wanna do the same?

09:53.941 --> 09:55.223
We can start over.

09:55.275 --> 09:59.394
And if you wanna change
any part of your story.

10:04.484 --> 10:07.068
Oh, I need to make a phone call.

10:21.635 --> 10:23.585
Hi, it's me.

10:23.637 --> 10:25.053
Sweetheart.

10:25.088 --> 10:27.055
<i>I'm, uh...</i>

10:27.090 --> 10:28.423
I'm...

10:28.475 --> 10:30.425
Carter, is everything okay?

10:30.477 --> 10:34.429
I'm at Loudoun County Police Station.

10:34.514 --> 10:36.681
Do you think you could come and meet me?

10:36.767 --> 10:38.767
Of course, I'm on my way.

10:38.819 --> 10:40.568
Thanks.

10:44.992 --> 10:46.441
Carter's in trouble.

10:48.578 --> 10:50.028
- Oh...
- What?

10:50.113 --> 10:51.579
This is my favorite show right here.

10:51.615 --> 10:53.365
Okay, you know what, it's my turn.

10:53.450 --> 10:55.283
Gabe, just pick a
channel. I'm working on it.

10:55.369 --> 10:57.002
I think you have a problem.

10:57.087 --> 10:58.787
Find something.

10:58.872 --> 11:00.171
Not "Real Housewives."

11:00.257 --> 11:01.790
- Are you serious?
- Shh.

11:01.875 --> 11:04.960
Guys, Bird is asleep.

11:05.012 --> 11:06.211
Yeah, you're making me dizzy.

11:06.296 --> 11:10.098
Here, I'll find something.

11:10.133 --> 11:12.050
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

11:12.135 --> 11:13.268
Damon.

11:13.303 --> 11:14.970
- What?
- It's part of my grieving process.

11:15.055 --> 11:16.304
To be fair, it was another thing

11:16.390 --> 11:17.605
that helped me when my dad died.

11:17.641 --> 11:21.059
Guys, guys, come on, keep it down.

11:21.144 --> 11:22.644
Oh, see, you woke her up.

11:22.729 --> 11:23.812
No, you didn't.

11:23.864 --> 11:25.280
I can't sleep.

11:25.315 --> 11:26.398
Look, I was thinking,

11:26.483 --> 11:27.949
we should have a memorial for him.

11:29.202 --> 11:30.485
That's a really nice idea.

11:30.570 --> 11:33.038
But isn't his family doing something?

11:33.123 --> 11:34.656
Yeah, well, back in Missouri.

11:34.741 --> 11:37.158
He had so many friends here,
I think we should do something.

11:37.244 --> 11:39.294
Maybe you should get some rest first.

11:39.329 --> 11:40.662
You know what, it's
gonna be the best funeral

11:40.714 --> 11:42.714
anyone's ever thrown...
there's gonna be music,

11:42.799 --> 11:44.716
dancing, a disco ball.

11:44.801 --> 11:46.301
And hot dogs.

11:46.336 --> 11:48.086
Seth really liked hot
dogs, which was gross.

11:48.171 --> 11:50.672
But yeah, hot dogs.

11:56.480 --> 11:57.479
What do we do?

11:57.514 --> 11:59.647
Help her... I mean,
what's the harm?

11:59.683 --> 12:01.649
I think they call it an Irish wake.

12:04.354 --> 12:05.653
So is your friend's story

12:05.689 --> 12:07.355
making you rethink your statement?

12:07.407 --> 12:09.357
No, I just don't have anything more to say.

12:09.443 --> 12:11.743
Isn't that how statements work?

12:11.828 --> 12:14.412
This interview is
over. Excuse me...

12:14.498 --> 12:16.948
You are illegally interrogating a minor.

12:17.034 --> 12:18.700
What are you doing here?

12:18.785 --> 12:20.418
Carter, don't say another word.

12:20.504 --> 12:22.537
- Lori, can you take her outside please?
- Carter...

12:22.622 --> 12:24.873
I specifically asked you not to call her.

12:24.958 --> 12:27.208
Carter...

12:27.260 --> 12:28.843
Fine.

12:30.547 --> 12:31.930
Are you her lawyer?

12:32.015 --> 12:33.548
No, her mother.

12:33.633 --> 12:36.051
Detective Wilson, Fairfax County Police.

12:36.103 --> 12:37.769
- Detective...
- Dougherty.

12:37.854 --> 12:39.854
Detective Dougherty, you wanna tell me how

12:39.890 --> 12:42.307
my daughter ended up in this
room without legal representation?

12:42.392 --> 12:43.942
I found her in a bar.

12:44.027 --> 12:45.393
I didn't know she was a minor.

12:45.445 --> 12:48.029
Well, that's interesting,
maybe you should've checked.

12:50.033 --> 12:51.783
Any more policing advice, Detective?

12:51.868 --> 12:54.869
Because I have some parenting tips for you.

12:54.905 --> 12:56.404
Why did you call her?

12:56.490 --> 12:58.239
It was the right thing to do.

12:58.291 --> 12:59.407
Yeah, but we're not talking.

12:59.493 --> 13:01.376
That's why I specifically asked for you.

13:01.411 --> 13:02.577
- And I'm glad you did.
- No, you don't understand...

13:02.662 --> 13:04.079
Carter, listen to me.

13:04.131 --> 13:06.297
Whatever is going on
between you and Elizabeth,

13:06.383 --> 13:08.383
it's time to let it go.

13:09.503 --> 13:10.835
Detective, you know you wanna find out

13:10.921 --> 13:12.670
who's actually responsible for this.

13:12.756 --> 13:14.422
We know who's responsible for this.

13:14.508 --> 13:16.091
That's why your daughter is here.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.810
No, tainted drugs killed Seth Blazer.

13:18.895 --> 13:20.478
And it comes from the same supply

13:20.564 --> 13:23.264
that's already killed five
people in Fairfax County.

13:23.316 --> 13:25.850
What's your point?

13:25.936 --> 13:27.769
We need to work together.

13:27.821 --> 13:28.937
Pool our resources.

13:29.022 --> 13:32.107
I've been tracking these
drug dealers for a month.

13:32.159 --> 13:33.491
Okay, got it, uh,

13:33.577 --> 13:35.110
so do you want me to call your supervisor

13:35.195 --> 13:37.612
and explain your conflict
of interest, or will you?

13:37.697 --> 13:39.447
You know what, we don't
have to play these games.

13:39.533 --> 13:41.866
We are on the same team.

13:41.952 --> 13:44.502
Look, Detective Wilson, I know who you are.

13:44.588 --> 13:47.672
Okay, you're the cop
whose kid got kidnapped.

13:47.757 --> 13:50.375
Okay, okay, you know who I am.

13:50.460 --> 13:51.843
Then you should understand

13:51.928 --> 13:54.262
how much Carter has been through already.

13:54.297 --> 13:55.597
Yeah, it's a terrible thing.

13:55.632 --> 13:56.965
And when bad things like that happen,

13:57.017 --> 13:59.884
kids never recover, do they? Never really.

13:59.970 --> 14:02.637
I mean, next thing you
know, it's underage drinking.

14:02.722 --> 14:04.806
Drugs.

14:04.891 --> 14:07.809
And a dead friend that she
helped put in the grave.

14:12.149 --> 14:13.481
I need you to dig around,

14:13.567 --> 14:15.900
see what you can find out on Dougherty.

14:15.986 --> 14:18.536
Well, ask everyone.

14:18.622 --> 14:20.955
As soon as possible, thanks.

14:22.792 --> 14:25.043
I wasn't the one who gave him those drugs.

14:25.128 --> 14:27.879
I believe you, but you could still
get in a lot of trouble for this.

14:27.964 --> 14:29.998
If the Loudoun police make it look like you

14:30.083 --> 14:31.883
allowed those drugs through the door,

14:31.968 --> 14:33.168
you could be charged.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.886
- With what?
- Manslaughter.

14:34.971 --> 14:37.388
And the fact that five other people died

14:37.474 --> 14:39.674
using the same tainted drugs, Carter,

14:39.726 --> 14:42.060
the charges could be even more serious.

14:42.145 --> 14:44.312
They could put that all on me?

14:44.347 --> 14:46.181
They could try, and you're almost 18.

14:46.266 --> 14:48.850
Which means... I could
be charged as an adult.

14:53.356 --> 14:54.939
Okay, what do we do?

14:55.025 --> 14:56.524
You stay here.

14:56.610 --> 14:58.109
You go nowhere.

14:58.195 --> 14:59.277
You talk to no one.

14:59.362 --> 15:01.579
Carter, this is important.

15:03.867 --> 15:05.750
I know that, um,

15:05.835 --> 15:07.785
things have been hard between us lately,

15:07.871 --> 15:10.672
but you're in way over your head.

15:10.707 --> 15:14.292
You've got to let me handle this, okay?

15:14.377 --> 15:16.511
Okay.

15:18.548 --> 15:20.682
- Where are you going?
- First things first.

15:20.717 --> 15:22.383
We need to talk to a lawyer.

15:27.190 --> 15:29.390
We are gonna fix this.

15:31.294 --> 15:33.394
Lori, we need to go.

15:52.862 --> 15:55.496
Carter... there you are.

15:55.531 --> 15:58.032
Did you tell the cops I knew
there were drugs at the party?

15:58.117 --> 16:00.034
- What?
- Please, just tell me the truth.

16:00.119 --> 16:01.835
Is that what they told you?

16:01.871 --> 16:03.871
- Did you, Jared?
- No, of course not.

16:03.923 --> 16:05.756
Why would I say that?

16:05.841 --> 16:07.541
Don't you get it?

16:07.593 --> 16:10.377
They told me the same thing.

16:10.429 --> 16:11.795
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:11.881 --> 16:13.547
The only difference is you believed 'em.

16:13.599 --> 16:14.765
I never did.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.356
I'm sorry.

16:22.391 --> 16:25.693
Sorry, I don't know what to think.

16:25.728 --> 16:27.728
Look, it's... it's
not your fault.

16:27.780 --> 16:29.063
All right, they're trying to get us

16:29.148 --> 16:31.115
to turn on each other.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.534
We can't let them, okay,
it's gonna be okay.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.143
Is it?

16:34.203 --> 16:35.986
Jared, the cops are out to get someone.

16:36.072 --> 16:37.621
- It won't be us.
- How do you know that?

16:37.707 --> 16:40.157
Because if they get someone,
it's gonna be the guy who

16:40.242 --> 16:42.076
sold Seth the drugs,
and we know who that is.

16:42.161 --> 16:43.794
No, Ben said he didn't do it.

16:43.879 --> 16:45.579
I admire your loyalty,

16:45.631 --> 16:47.414
but he's lied to us before.

16:47.466 --> 16:49.133
Your brother put a credit card reader

16:49.218 --> 16:52.886
in the bar to steal from
our customers and from us.

16:55.841 --> 16:57.424
Yeah.

16:57.476 --> 16:58.759
I guess I didn't want to believe that

16:58.811 --> 17:00.060
it might be true.

17:00.096 --> 17:01.645
Ben might not wanna lie,

17:01.731 --> 17:03.981
but after everything that's gone down,

17:04.066 --> 17:06.400
he may feel like he has no choice.

17:08.688 --> 17:10.938
What're you doing... I thought
we were gonna go see a lawyer.

17:10.990 --> 17:13.440
- No, I'm dropping you off.
- Why?

17:13.492 --> 17:15.075
Because I can handle everything from here.

17:15.111 --> 17:17.411
But I thought
that... Look, I...

17:17.445 --> 17:20.196
appreciate you coming to
me, but now you need to go.

17:20.281 --> 17:23.534
Carter called me this morning... me.

17:23.618 --> 17:26.453
You wouldn't've even known she was
in trouble if it weren't for me.

17:27.839 --> 17:31.542
And even though I desperately
wanted to be her mom today,

17:31.627 --> 17:32.793
I called you.

17:32.845 --> 17:34.628
If you wanted what was best for Carter,

17:34.680 --> 17:36.680
you wouldn't've taken
her in the first place.

17:36.766 --> 17:38.132
I know you don't want me in your life,

17:38.184 --> 17:39.933
Elizabeth, I get it.

17:39.969 --> 17:41.685
But, look, if what you say is true,

17:41.771 --> 17:43.137
Carter is in a lot of trouble,

17:43.189 --> 17:45.773
and she's gonna need
all the help she can get.

17:45.808 --> 17:47.307
From anyone who truly cares about her.

17:55.985 --> 17:58.035
Hey, man, is Bird here?

17:58.120 --> 18:01.372
Uh, yeah, she's here.

18:01.457 --> 18:04.742
Okay, uh... I just wanna see her,

18:04.827 --> 18:05.826
is it cool if I come in?

18:05.878 --> 18:08.328
I don't think that's a good idea.

18:08.414 --> 18:09.329
Why is that?

18:09.415 --> 18:11.081
Well, her boyfriend OD'd last night.

18:11.167 --> 18:12.332
But maybe you hadn't heard that.

18:12.418 --> 18:13.834
Yeah, you know, I didn't actually

18:13.886 --> 18:15.169
sell him the drugs, right?

18:15.221 --> 18:17.721
I just wanna make sure she's doing okay.

18:17.807 --> 18:19.390
She has plenty of friends for that.

18:21.894 --> 18:23.477
All right.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.847
Actually, you know what, man?

18:26.899 --> 18:30.067
I know you always think
you know which end is up,

18:30.152 --> 18:33.153
but sometimes everything is upside-down.

18:38.027 --> 18:40.160
No, thanks, Bobby, I appreciate it.

18:40.196 --> 18:43.080
Uh, I owe you
one... right.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.867
So what'd he say?

18:46.919 --> 18:48.535
Dougherty is ambitious,

18:48.587 --> 18:51.205
will do anything to get
promoted, apparently.

18:51.290 --> 18:53.040
Worst nightmare, basically.

18:53.125 --> 18:55.042
Yeah, well, the worst part about it is

18:55.127 --> 18:56.343
this is exactly the kind of case

18:56.378 --> 18:58.045
that cops build their careers on.

18:58.097 --> 19:00.431
Especially now that he knows who we are.

19:00.516 --> 19:02.766
- So what do we do?
- We need to talk to Carter.

19:02.852 --> 19:04.601
Carter?

19:04.687 --> 19:08.055
Carter, could you come down here please?

19:12.645 --> 19:13.977
Did she leave?

19:14.063 --> 19:15.979
Of course, she did.

19:16.065 --> 19:18.449
Damn it, why is she so impulsive?

19:18.534 --> 19:20.534
She's been that way since
she was a little girl.

19:22.238 --> 19:25.122
I'm so sorry, I shouldn't've...

19:25.207 --> 19:27.241
Why don't you call her?

19:27.293 --> 19:30.627
Who knows, maybe she'll
actually pick up the phone.

19:44.143 --> 19:46.393
So, where's everybody else?

19:46.428 --> 19:48.428
Running around, getting
stuff for the memorial.

19:48.514 --> 19:50.848
Sorry I couldn't come over sooner.

19:50.933 --> 19:54.601
Well, you're here now, and
I'm gonna put you to work.

19:54.687 --> 19:56.487
Don't you worry.

19:56.572 --> 19:59.606
Okay, so am I looking for particular ones

19:59.658 --> 20:02.242
or just, like, good pictures?

20:02.278 --> 20:04.945
Look at the face on that man.

20:04.997 --> 20:06.997
They're all good photos.

20:07.082 --> 20:08.699
But no-no, we need the great ones.

20:08.784 --> 20:10.701
Okay.

20:10.786 --> 20:13.120
All right.

20:14.206 --> 20:15.956
Three amigos?

20:16.008 --> 20:18.008
That was our third date.

20:18.093 --> 20:20.127
We both got food poisoning.

20:21.630 --> 20:23.297
Put it in the maybes.

20:23.382 --> 20:25.849
Okay.

20:25.935 --> 20:27.384
Yes.

20:27.469 --> 20:30.437
No... definitely not.

20:33.859 --> 20:36.476
Okay, maybe.

20:36.529 --> 20:38.695
Bird...

20:38.781 --> 20:41.448
you know, it's okay to be upset.

20:41.483 --> 20:42.983
I'll have all the time in the world to cry

20:43.035 --> 20:45.319
after the memorial.

20:46.488 --> 20:48.455
Where's this one from?

20:48.490 --> 20:50.240
That was...

20:50.326 --> 20:51.825
your first party.

20:51.877 --> 20:53.961
It was an hour after we met,

20:53.996 --> 20:57.214
and the generators went off.

20:57.299 --> 20:59.216
And he kissed me in the dark.

21:03.339 --> 21:06.340
I'm so sorry, I feel
like this is all my fault.

21:06.392 --> 21:08.592
That's crazy, it was an accident.

21:08.677 --> 21:10.394
No, but if I hadn't started
throwing all these parties...

21:10.479 --> 21:12.262
Then I never would've met him.

21:12.348 --> 21:13.764
Okay, well, if I hadn't
brought Ben into the group...

21:13.849 --> 21:16.350
What does Ben have
anything to do with this?

21:19.104 --> 21:21.321
Okay.

21:21.357 --> 21:23.657
I'm sorry I never told you this before.

21:23.692 --> 21:25.859
I didn't know how.

21:25.911 --> 21:27.661
Tell me what?

21:27.696 --> 21:30.364
I caught Ben dealing at the party.

21:30.416 --> 21:33.033
He was the one that
sold Seth the bad pills.

21:33.118 --> 21:34.751
No, sweetie, he didn't.

21:34.837 --> 21:38.505
Yes, he did, Bird, I wish it wasn't true.

21:38.540 --> 21:42.793
I was with Seth when he got them.

21:42.878 --> 21:45.045
Jared sold Seth the drugs.

21:45.097 --> 21:46.930
- What?
- The security confiscated

21:47.016 --> 21:48.215
the stuff he brought to the party.

21:48.300 --> 21:51.435
Jared sold us stuff when we got inside.

21:59.143 --> 22:01.210
Did you tell Carter that
I sold Seth those pills?

22:01.310 --> 22:04.311
What are you doing? Get in here.

22:04.397 --> 22:05.729
All right, look, I'm taking the blame

22:05.781 --> 22:07.564
for something we both know I didn't do.

22:07.616 --> 22:09.316
But maybe you know who did, Jared.

22:09.402 --> 22:10.701
Watch yourself, Ben.

22:11.620 --> 22:13.203
Rest of the stash is in there.

22:13.239 --> 22:14.538
What the
hell... I'm out.

22:14.573 --> 22:15.989
I don't want anything
to do with those pills,

22:16.075 --> 22:17.574
and I don't want anything to do with you.

22:17.660 --> 22:19.660
Hey, you're the one who
wanted to sell, remember?

22:19.745 --> 22:21.962
You practically begged me, now what?

22:22.047 --> 22:22.746
Huh?

22:22.798 --> 22:25.382
You suddenly found Jesus?

22:25.418 --> 22:26.967
Look, this is so screwed up.

22:27.052 --> 22:28.419
You need to tell Carter
that you were the one

22:28.504 --> 22:29.420
who was dealing.

22:29.472 --> 22:30.671
Hey, Carter knows

22:30.756 --> 22:32.556
exactly what she needs to.

22:32.591 --> 22:34.475
Keep telling yourself that, Jared.

22:34.560 --> 22:36.427
You're not gonna say a word to her.

22:36.512 --> 22:38.312
She'd never believe you, anyway.

22:48.023 --> 22:49.490
<i>Hey, this is Carter, leave a message.</i>

22:49.575 --> 22:51.775
Voicemail, again.

22:53.529 --> 22:54.945
Where the hell is she?

22:54.997 --> 22:56.914
Maybe it's time for a little break.

22:56.949 --> 22:59.950
She could be getting herself
into even more trouble.

23:00.002 --> 23:01.785
Why don't I make you a
sandwich or something?

23:01.871 --> 23:03.036
- That'll calm you down...
- No, I'm not hungry.

23:03.122 --> 23:04.505
Elizabeth, you
really need to...

23:04.590 --> 23:05.672
No, thank you.

23:05.758 --> 23:07.875
My daughter, she's missing.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.878
And given how much experience
I have with this situation,

23:10.963 --> 23:13.680
I think I know what I need.

23:17.887 --> 23:20.721
Look, I can't change what I did.

23:20.806 --> 23:23.357
But I am sorry.

23:23.442 --> 23:24.691
I'm sorry I took Carter,

23:24.777 --> 23:26.977
that you missed all those years with her.

23:29.031 --> 23:31.565
You're a great mom, clearly.

23:31.650 --> 23:33.317
Better than I am.

23:34.987 --> 23:37.371
You didn't deserve any
of what happened to you.

23:37.456 --> 23:39.957
Hey, Mom...

23:39.992 --> 23:43.744
whoa, uh, I'm not even gonna ask.

23:43.829 --> 23:47.798
I... can't think of a joke right now.

23:47.833 --> 23:50.384
That's probably for the best.

23:50.469 --> 23:52.302
Yeah, right, uh...

23:52.338 --> 23:53.554
I'm...

23:53.639 --> 23:55.973
I'm gonna go.

24:01.013 --> 24:02.513
Hey.

24:02.565 --> 24:03.597
What're you doing here?

24:03.682 --> 24:05.682
Can I come in?

24:05.768 --> 24:08.402
Yeah, what's going on?

24:12.525 --> 24:14.741
- Where are you going?
- Away.

24:14.827 --> 24:16.243
Look, Carter, I know
you're not gonna believe...

24:16.328 --> 24:18.579
Ben, I know you didn't
sell Seth those drugs.

24:18.664 --> 24:19.746
You do?

24:19.832 --> 24:21.498
Yeah, Jared did.

24:21.534 --> 24:24.034
Bird just told me.

24:25.337 --> 24:27.037
Wait, you didn't do
it, why are you leaving?

24:27.122 --> 24:28.839
Because the cops don't give a crap about

24:28.874 --> 24:30.374
a little detail like I
didn't actually do it,

24:30.426 --> 24:33.627
and honestly neither does
anybody else, apparently.

24:33.712 --> 24:36.013
Ben, I'm sorry I doubted you, okay?

24:36.048 --> 24:38.715
All right, well, you know what,
maybe you should've doubted me.

24:38.767 --> 24:40.017
You know, you know what the worst part is

24:40.052 --> 24:42.219
is I actually could've
dealt Seth those drugs,

24:42.304 --> 24:43.604
I would have.

24:43.689 --> 24:45.389
Yeah, but it was a one-time thing, right?

24:47.393 --> 24:48.725
Wasn't it?

24:48.811 --> 24:50.444
All right, look, I didn't have a choice.

24:51.864 --> 24:53.730
Someone made you sell drugs?

24:53.816 --> 24:55.032
Okay, Seth isn't your fault,

24:55.067 --> 24:56.233
but maybe it's time you start taking

24:56.285 --> 24:57.568
a little bit of responsibility

24:57.653 --> 24:58.569
- for your...
- Jared.

24:58.654 --> 24:59.736
What?

24:59.822 --> 25:01.038
All right, you know what, nevermind.

25:01.073 --> 25:02.623
- I can't get into it.
- What?

25:02.708 --> 25:04.875
Ben, tell me.

25:08.247 --> 25:09.296
He blackmailed me.

25:09.381 --> 25:11.081
I didn't have a choice.

25:13.586 --> 25:16.136
He... he made
you deal?

25:16.221 --> 25:18.972
Yeah, or he said he was gonna
turn me in for the card reader.

25:19.058 --> 25:21.058
All right, that's when it started.

25:24.396 --> 25:25.729
I feel sick.

25:25.764 --> 25:28.348
All right, look, I'm sorry.

25:28.434 --> 25:29.816
Why didn't you tell me?

25:29.902 --> 25:32.436
Why do you think?

25:32.521 --> 25:33.770
I gotta go.

25:33.822 --> 25:35.606
Hey, you can't tell him you know.

25:35.691 --> 25:36.823
I have to do something!

25:36.909 --> 25:38.241
No, you don't!

25:38.277 --> 25:39.776
Not for me, I can take care of myself.

25:39.862 --> 25:41.612
Okay, well then, for Seth, Ben.

25:41.697 --> 25:45.666
I have to prove that Jared was
the one who sold him the pills.

25:45.751 --> 25:46.950
What?

25:48.120 --> 25:50.621
Do you know something that's gonna help me?

25:50.706 --> 25:53.790
Ben? Tell me.

25:53.842 --> 25:55.709
All right, I know where his stash is.

25:55.794 --> 25:58.962
I gave it back to him, he
had it at the bar an hour ago.

26:01.383 --> 26:02.849
Carter.

26:02.935 --> 26:06.053
Don't go there alone.

26:06.138 --> 26:08.722
I won't, okay, just don't go anywhere.

26:08.807 --> 26:09.940
All right?

26:21.286 --> 26:23.320
There's nothing in the office.

26:26.125 --> 26:27.574
Does he keep a wrench around here?

26:27.660 --> 26:29.076
Uh, yeah,
under the sink...

26:29.161 --> 26:30.577
why, what're you gonna do?

26:30.663 --> 26:32.546
Stuff collects in the trap.

26:32.631 --> 26:36.133
So if he dumped the pills, maybe
there's some stuck in there.

26:38.504 --> 26:41.004
You know, if we don't find these,

26:41.056 --> 26:43.140
why couldn't Bird just
tell the cops about Jared?

26:43.175 --> 26:45.092
Oh, come on, any decent lawyer is gonna

26:45.177 --> 26:46.810
say she was in a drug haze that night

26:46.845 --> 26:48.345
and couldn't prove it was Jared.

26:48.397 --> 26:51.314
Could've just as easily been
Bird who took the bad pill.

26:53.185 --> 26:54.601
Sorry, I don't know why I said that.

26:54.687 --> 26:56.486
Okay, I got it.

26:56.522 --> 27:00.490
Here we go.

27:00.526 --> 27:01.658
Empty, no pills.

27:01.694 --> 27:03.326
Wait...

27:05.414 --> 27:07.330
Damn.

27:17.710 --> 27:18.925
They dissolved.

27:19.011 --> 27:21.628
We need to call the cops.

27:21.714 --> 27:23.597
Here, put it back, quickly!

27:23.682 --> 27:25.182
Give me that.

27:40.616 --> 27:42.032
Hey.

27:43.402 --> 27:45.235
What're you two doing here?

27:49.584 --> 27:50.716
I thought you were at Bird's.

27:51.211 --> 27:52.243
Uh, yeah, I was.

27:52.510 --> 27:53.676
She wanted to see if you'd donate

27:53.761 --> 27:55.428
some booze for the memorial.

27:55.463 --> 27:56.796
Booze.

27:56.881 --> 27:58.631
Yeah, she wants to make it, like,

27:58.716 --> 28:00.716
a real celebration.

28:00.802 --> 28:02.185
Kind of an Irish
wake and bake...

28:02.270 --> 28:04.103
So it takes two of you
to ask me to contribute

28:04.138 --> 28:05.605
to the delinquency of minors?

28:05.640 --> 28:07.607
No, I brought Max 'cause I thought

28:07.642 --> 28:09.859
he could help with the bottles.

28:12.113 --> 28:14.647
I have a couple of cases
of IPA and cab in the back.

28:14.732 --> 28:16.449
You could start with those.

28:16.484 --> 28:17.567
Great.

28:17.652 --> 28:19.819
Thanks.

28:23.291 --> 28:25.374
Babe, is everything okay?

28:27.829 --> 28:30.129
I'm better.

28:30.164 --> 28:31.797
Are you?

28:31.833 --> 28:33.716
You know how hard today has been.

28:33.801 --> 28:35.968
Yeah, for both of us.

28:37.505 --> 28:39.889
Did anything come up?

28:39.974 --> 28:43.676
No, just sticking as close
to the truth as possible,

28:43.761 --> 28:45.728
like you said.

28:47.098 --> 28:49.682
Is it wrong that I think
you're even more beautiful

28:49.767 --> 28:52.018
when you're sad?

28:53.738 --> 28:56.072
Hey, come here.

29:01.946 --> 29:04.864
Carter, can you unlock the car?

29:06.367 --> 29:09.702
Um... yeah, sure.

29:09.787 --> 29:11.420
We should probably get back to Bird.

29:11.506 --> 29:12.872
Yeah, of course.

29:15.126 --> 29:16.876
Call me later.

29:17.845 --> 29:19.211
Yeah, of course.

29:20.381 --> 29:22.882
Bye.

29:33.528 --> 29:36.862
- Wow, there's a dynamic duo.
- What're you doing?

29:36.898 --> 29:38.564
If you're looking for
Carter, she's not here.

29:38.650 --> 29:40.032
No, we came to talk to you.

29:40.068 --> 29:41.567
There's nothing left to talk about,

29:41.619 --> 29:42.568
especially not to a cop.

29:42.654 --> 29:44.236
So what, you're just gonna run?

29:44.289 --> 29:45.738
That's your big plan?

29:45.790 --> 29:46.989
Worked for you, didn't it?

29:47.075 --> 29:48.624
Ben, let us help you.

29:48.710 --> 29:50.459
No, you can't help me, all right?

29:50.545 --> 29:51.961
You don't know that. Yeah, I do.

29:52.046 --> 29:52.912
If you knew what
I've done, you'd...

29:52.997 --> 29:55.047
Hey, we all make mistakes.

29:56.918 --> 30:00.052
I gotta go, all right, it's
just best for everybody.

30:00.088 --> 30:02.922
Ben, please, just take
it from someone who knows

30:03.007 --> 30:04.840
a thing or two about disappearing kids.

30:04.926 --> 30:06.475
It's not best for anyone.

30:06.561 --> 30:09.395
I don't know exactly
what happened with you.

30:09.430 --> 30:10.930
And you're right, I am a cop.

30:10.982 --> 30:14.350
And as a cop, I can help you.

30:14.435 --> 30:15.768
If you let me.

30:15.853 --> 30:18.738
All you have to do

30:18.773 --> 30:21.273
is trust us.

30:22.577 --> 30:24.410
Please.

30:32.954 --> 30:36.339
You okay?

30:36.424 --> 30:37.840
Yeah.

30:37.925 --> 30:39.458
Feel like I need to take a shower.

30:42.296 --> 30:45.931
After you talk to your mom.

30:45.967 --> 30:49.101
Right... can't wait.

30:51.189 --> 30:54.140
All that matters is you guys are okay.

30:54.225 --> 30:56.192
We had to leave the bar without any proof.

30:56.277 --> 30:58.361
And the Loudoun County cops
still don't know about it?

30:58.446 --> 31:00.813
Did you tell them anything
that you haven't told us?

31:00.898 --> 31:02.815
No, I don't think so.

31:02.900 --> 31:04.450
Anything about Ben?

31:04.485 --> 31:06.485
Nope.

31:06.571 --> 31:09.121
Well, not from me, anyway.

31:09.157 --> 31:12.158
How do we know Jared's not just
trying to cover his own ass?

31:12.243 --> 31:14.994
Well, I did make him promise
to keep your name out of it.

31:15.079 --> 31:16.495
But... that was when I thought

31:16.581 --> 31:18.247
his promises still meant something.

31:18.332 --> 31:20.583
Wait, this
is my friend from Loudoun.

31:20.668 --> 31:22.802
Hey.

31:22.837 --> 31:24.920
Oh, man.

31:25.006 --> 31:27.506
- Okay, keep me posted.
- What happened?

31:27.558 --> 31:29.675
Dougherty got an arrest warrant.

31:29.761 --> 31:31.060
Great, so he did screw me.

31:31.145 --> 31:35.181
It's not for you, it's for Carter.

31:35.233 --> 31:37.066
- What?
- A new witness came forward

31:37.151 --> 31:39.518
and said that you knew
about the drugs all along.

31:39.570 --> 31:40.603
What witness?

31:40.688 --> 31:42.354
Jared.

31:42.440 --> 31:44.857
He must've known what you
guys were up to at the bar.

31:49.580 --> 31:50.946
All right, you know what,
call that Dougherty guy.

31:51.032 --> 31:52.164
I'll tell him Jared blackmailed me

31:52.200 --> 31:53.499
and that he organized the drug sales.

31:53.534 --> 31:55.951
Ben, using a credit
card reader is a felony.

31:56.037 --> 31:57.420
Yeah, a felony that I committed,

31:57.505 --> 31:59.205
and I'm willing to take
that responsibility.

31:59.257 --> 32:00.623
I'm not letting Carter go down for this.

32:00.708 --> 32:02.341
Thank you, but I'm not
gonna let you do that.

32:02.376 --> 32:04.126
And the cops aren't gonna
listen to you anyway.

32:04.212 --> 32:06.128
No-no-no, let's
just slow down.

32:06.214 --> 32:08.547
There's gotta be a better way.

32:10.017 --> 32:12.051
Let's think.

32:12.103 --> 32:14.053
I wanna kill that guy.

32:20.695 --> 32:23.112
Hello, Jared.

32:27.034 --> 32:28.067
Can I help you?

32:28.152 --> 32:30.035
Yeah, you can listen to me.

32:30.071 --> 32:32.404
No, you can leave. Or I can call the cops.

32:32.490 --> 32:33.906
Oh, you don't need to do
that, I already did that.

32:33.958 --> 32:37.710
- They're on their way.
- Excuse me?

32:37.745 --> 32:40.329
So what you're gonna do is
you're gonna give a statement

32:40.414 --> 32:42.081
when the Loudoun County police get here,

32:42.166 --> 32:43.999
and you're gonna confess that

32:44.085 --> 32:45.584
you sold the drugs to Seth Blazer,

32:45.670 --> 32:48.587
and that Carter had nothing to do with it.

32:48.673 --> 32:49.722
And why would I do that?

32:49.757 --> 32:51.307
'Cause the drugs that you sold Seth

32:51.392 --> 32:53.175
come from a ring that's been implicated

32:53.261 --> 32:54.894
with five other deaths.

32:54.929 --> 32:56.395
And I can make sure

32:56.430 --> 33:00.983
that your name is plastered
all over that case.

33:01.068 --> 33:03.853
The only proof you have of
my connection to anything

33:03.938 --> 33:05.488
is that I attended those parties.

33:05.573 --> 33:08.691
No, because Carter can testify otherwise.

33:08.776 --> 33:10.743
So it's the word of a
taxpaying business-owner

33:10.778 --> 33:13.112
against a high school dropout,
yeah, I'll take my chances.

33:13.197 --> 33:14.613
Plus, you're law enforcement.

33:14.699 --> 33:17.416
Your own kid's involved.

33:17.451 --> 33:19.451
You wouldn't take the
chance lying to the DA.

33:19.537 --> 33:21.871
Did Carter ever tell you I kidnapped her?

33:21.956 --> 33:23.839
Twice.

33:23.925 --> 33:25.457
Yeah, she did.

33:25.510 --> 33:28.460
So you're insane... so what?

33:28.546 --> 33:31.547
So I get that you're
not afraid of Elizabeth

33:31.632 --> 33:34.133
because you think she has
boundaries she can't cross,

33:34.185 --> 33:35.968
but you're right.

33:36.053 --> 33:37.052
I am insane.

33:37.138 --> 33:38.637
Boundaries mean nothing to me.

33:41.526 --> 33:43.809
Yeah, the whole good
cop, crazy lady routine's

33:43.895 --> 33:45.110
not gonna work on me.

33:45.146 --> 33:46.612
- No?
- No.

33:46.647 --> 33:48.697
Hey, Lori!

33:48.783 --> 33:50.649
Lori. Back away, I mean it.

33:50.735 --> 33:51.984
Drop the gun.

33:54.455 --> 33:56.322
In case you doubted it, there is nothing

33:56.407 --> 33:58.791
I wouldn't do to protect my daughter.

33:58.826 --> 34:00.910
Lori! Don't!

34:00.995 --> 34:03.629
Now give me one reason not to kill you.

34:05.550 --> 34:06.067
Now.

34:06.093 --> 34:08.132
Because Carter's not
gonna go down for this.

34:08.168 --> 34:10.168
Why not? Besides the
fact that she's underage,

34:10.254 --> 34:11.587
she didn't know anything about the drugs.

34:11.672 --> 34:13.389
Then why'd you tell the cops what she did?

34:13.474 --> 34:15.757
I didn't know what to do,
because I got a lot more to lose.

34:15.842 --> 34:17.810
My kid. This bar.

34:17.844 --> 34:20.728
You really think I care
about your problems right now?

34:20.815 --> 34:23.148
- I'm just saying..
-  Hey.

34:28.906 --> 34:30.822
All right.

34:30.858 --> 34:33.074
<i>I admit it, Carter
had nothing to do with it.</i>

34:33.159 --> 34:35.027
<i>Okay? I panicked because I could see</i>

34:35.112 --> 34:36.745
<i>that they were on to me.</i>

34:36.831 --> 34:38.530
That's it, we got it.

34:52.940 --> 34:55.056
You're one scary lady.

34:55.143 --> 34:56.641
Back at ya.

34:56.728 --> 34:58.728
Uh, don't forget your pockets.

34:58.780 --> 35:00.062
Right.

35:06.654 --> 35:09.405
I'll be right back.

35:11.042 --> 35:12.241
Here you go, Detective.

35:12.327 --> 35:13.743
Thank you.

35:13.795 --> 35:16.412
- Get everything you need?
- I got enough.

35:16.498 --> 35:18.748
You know, this is a win for you too.

35:18.800 --> 35:21.884
It will be, if I nail the suppliers.

35:21.920 --> 35:24.754
You just let me know if you
wanna join forces on that.

35:27.308 --> 35:29.926
I don't know when you guys
started playing Rizzoli & Isles,

35:29.978 --> 35:32.428
but, uh, I like to work alone.

35:32.514 --> 35:33.930
Ladies.

35:41.105 --> 35:44.407
Do I even wanna know how you guys did it?

35:44.442 --> 35:46.943
Your mom's a badass, that's how.

35:47.028 --> 35:48.494
That's cryptic.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.829
It's only half the story,

35:49.914 --> 35:53.616
but let's keep it on
a need-to-know basis.

35:53.701 --> 35:56.502
Well, I know enough to say thank you.

35:56.588 --> 35:57.787
Both of you.

35:57.839 --> 36:00.206
We're both just glad that you're safe.

36:00.291 --> 36:04.927
Thanks, this is so weird.

36:04.963 --> 36:07.680
Yeah, on that note, it's been a long night.

36:07.765 --> 36:09.632
I'm gonna head on out.

36:09.684 --> 36:13.636
Hey, um, thank you.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.773
Seriously, for everything.

36:18.726 --> 36:20.309
Anything for you, sweetie.

36:20.395 --> 36:22.478
Bye.

36:36.160 --> 36:37.460
I'm sorry.

36:37.495 --> 36:40.746
I just...

36:40.832 --> 36:42.999
I thought I had it all under control.

36:45.169 --> 36:47.336
I know you did.

36:47.422 --> 36:51.674
I guess I didn't want to need anyone.

36:53.761 --> 36:55.928
Carter, I understand

36:56.014 --> 36:57.513
you wanting to take care of yourself

36:57.599 --> 37:00.650
after everything you've been through.

37:00.685 --> 37:03.819
It's really tough to need people.

37:05.240 --> 37:07.023
But I do.

37:08.026 --> 37:09.191
And I do, too.

37:12.780 --> 37:15.197
I will always be there for you.

37:16.334 --> 37:18.034
Thank you.

37:23.424 --> 37:25.341
It's your dad.

37:25.376 --> 37:27.260
What're you gonna tell him?

37:28.513 --> 37:30.546
That's a good question.

37:36.688 --> 37:39.105
Sorry, Father, I don't need a sermon today.

37:39.190 --> 37:40.690
No sermons.

37:40.725 --> 37:43.559
I just wanted to say that I misjudged you.

37:43.611 --> 37:45.861
And I don't think you're a bad guy.

37:45.897 --> 37:48.981
But you have done some sketchy stuff.

37:49.067 --> 37:50.950
Yeah, well, I guess...

37:51.035 --> 37:53.069
mistakes were made all around.

37:54.822 --> 37:58.207
You're lucky you have a sister
who really cares about you.

37:58.242 --> 37:59.909
Yeah, I am.

38:01.462 --> 38:03.245
- Are we cool?
- Yeah, we're cool.

38:04.582 --> 38:06.248
You wanna give me a lift to Bird's?

38:06.334 --> 38:08.250
I can bless that union.

38:08.336 --> 38:11.053
- Okay, cool, give me a sec.
- All right.

38:13.257 --> 38:14.974
So he's going to prison?

38:15.059 --> 38:15.925
Yep.

38:15.977 --> 38:17.510
For a few years, at least.

38:17.595 --> 38:19.812
Well, what did he say to you?

38:19.897 --> 38:22.098
Nothing, we didn't talk.

38:22.150 --> 38:23.516
Never even saw him.

38:23.601 --> 38:25.735
Doesn't matter.

38:25.770 --> 38:28.270
Are you okay? You haven't
said anything in a while.

38:29.490 --> 38:30.990
Yeah, no, I just...

38:31.075 --> 38:33.909
Oh, I'm sorry, I shouldn't've
told you all that stuff.

38:33.945 --> 38:36.195
No, it's not that.

38:36.280 --> 38:38.614
Well, what is it, then?

38:40.702 --> 38:43.119
Bird?

38:43.204 --> 38:45.755
Hey, come on, you can tell us, okay?

38:45.790 --> 38:47.456
Please don't hate me.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.792
What are you talking about?
We would never hate you.

38:49.877 --> 38:52.628
No matter what.

38:55.516 --> 38:57.299
I'm pregnant.

38:59.637 --> 39:01.137
Really?

39:02.140 --> 39:04.140
Yeah.

39:06.644 --> 39:08.310
Okay.

39:08.396 --> 39:09.779
We're gonna figure this out.

39:09.814 --> 39:11.614
Yeah. Yeah.

39:11.649 --> 39:14.033
We love you. We're here for you.

39:14.118 --> 39:15.618
Okay?

39:15.653 --> 39:17.403
And we are not going anywhere.

39:17.488 --> 39:20.156
I don't know what I
would do without you guys.

39:32.837 --> 39:35.171
Hey. Hey.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.840
So sorry, I have to go.

39:37.892 --> 39:40.009
Thanks for staying with me.

39:40.094 --> 39:41.844
Of course.

39:42.897 --> 39:43.979
Can I get you anything?

39:44.015 --> 39:45.347
You want some coffee?

39:45.400 --> 39:46.849
No, I'm good, I'm...

39:46.901 --> 39:48.768
just call me later, okay?

39:48.853 --> 39:51.437
Okay, I'll call you right now if you want.

39:51.522 --> 39:53.155
All right.

39:53.191 --> 39:55.024
Gabe's right next door if you need him.

39:55.076 --> 39:56.442
Okay.

39:56.527 --> 39:58.611
- Love you.
- Love you.

39:58.696 --> 40:00.830
Bye.

40:45.376 --> 40:46.008
Next time on "Finding Carter."

40:46.043 --> 40:47.543
Carter. Jared's off

40:47.628 --> 40:49.345
if he puts together a
list of everyone involved.

40:49.380 --> 40:51.046
I figured you could use a friend.

40:51.132 --> 40:53.048
I can't come in? Now's
not really a good time.

40:53.100 --> 40:54.332
Ben ran... nobody
knows where he is.
