[sound effect playing]

00:03.871 --> 00:06.274
[theme music]

00:49.683 --> 00:52.086
[laughing]

00:52.186 --> 00:54.054
[music playing]

00:54.155 --> 00:56.257
[inaudible] possible straight.

00:56.357 --> 00:59.260
Another duck for
[inaudible] zippo,

00:59.360 --> 01:02.563
and shinola for the dealer.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.198
That's to you Palidin.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.999
Two-bits.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.535
[belching]

01:07.635 --> 01:08.936
Beautiful!
[applause]

01:09.036 --> 01:09.903
Again, again.

01:10.003 --> 01:11.639
Judges, get a
drum or something.

01:11.739 --> 01:12.540
Five.

01:12.640 --> 01:13.507
Thank you.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.176
He's fired from
the communist judge.

01:15.276 --> 01:16.277
OK.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.045
Did I tell you guys
about my cousin Leon?

01:18.146 --> 01:19.547
Eh, how's Leon doing?

01:19.647 --> 01:21.715
He bought these two mail
order brides through a catalog.

01:21.815 --> 01:22.950
- Catalog?
- Yep.

01:23.050 --> 01:25.153
And UPS delivered them right
to his door buck naked.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.053
[laughing]

01:26.154 --> 01:27.621
- Get out out of town.
- Yeah.

01:27.721 --> 01:28.889
They both look like
Michelle Pfeiffer,

01:28.989 --> 01:31.091
except they had
really big heads.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.059
Ooh.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.127
OK.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.329
Who wants to chip in
for Arnie's therapy?

01:35.429 --> 01:36.330
[interposing voices]

01:36.430 --> 01:37.331
Here you go.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.666
OK.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.934
Now, I told you about me dating
that belly dancer, right?

01:41.034 --> 01:42.303
Oh, listen to this.
Listen to this.

01:42.403 --> 01:43.171
His story?
All right.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.138
All right.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.072
This chick had
such muscle control

01:45.173 --> 01:46.207
that she could pick up a--

01:46.307 --> 01:47.107
[clearing throat]

01:47.208 --> 01:48.041
Hey, honey.

01:48.142 --> 01:48.942
[interposing voices]

01:49.042 --> 01:49.943
[laughing]

01:50.043 --> 01:50.844
Hey

01:50.944 --> 01:51.745
Hey

01:51.845 --> 01:52.680
Can I [inaudible]?

01:52.780 --> 01:56.184
Well, hey, go
knock yourself out.

01:56.284 --> 01:58.386
So what were y'all saying?

01:58.486 --> 02:00.888
Oh Yeah, I, uh--

02:00.988 --> 02:03.891
yeah, you could use a
crosscut saw on that.

02:03.991 --> 02:07.328
But I'd use a hand saw myself,
because it's a lot easier.

02:07.428 --> 02:08.629
I've always held a band saw.
I'm a band saw man.

02:08.729 --> 02:09.897
Well, you know,
I was going to say,

02:09.997 --> 02:10.864
you look like a band saw man.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.933
Hey, you better
use your coasters.

02:13.033 --> 02:13.834
Ha!

02:13.934 --> 02:15.503
Made you look.

02:15.603 --> 02:17.271
[laughing]

02:17.371 --> 02:18.339
Power tools.

02:18.439 --> 02:19.840
You know, that's
their little code

02:19.940 --> 02:22.943
for fallopians approaching.

02:23.043 --> 02:25.479
We don't know what goes on the
minute we're out of that room.

02:25.579 --> 02:26.680
That's right.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.115
Well, you know, they talk
about their first time,

02:28.216 --> 02:30.318
and their last time,
and how many times,

02:30.418 --> 02:32.553
and they multiply it
all by about five,

02:32.653 --> 02:34.688
and then they spit at
each other, and go home.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.557
I don't know why they do that.

02:36.657 --> 02:37.525
I don't know.

02:37.625 --> 02:38.959
We're talking about
the only animal

02:39.059 --> 02:42.930
on earth that would wear black
socks with Bermuda shorts.

02:43.030 --> 02:46.467
Now (SILLY VOICE) we
put on our little ears.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.902
Roseanne, do I
have to do this,

02:49.002 --> 02:53.507
because you needs a
Halloween "tostume."

02:53.607 --> 02:56.344
I don't want to go
to Dan's stupid lodge,

02:56.444 --> 02:58.646
stupid haunted house thing.

02:58.746 --> 03:01.649
- But it's for charity.
- I know.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.917
But it's no fun having
some 60-year-old guy

03:04.017 --> 03:06.554
with a pot belly jumping out
at me saying, ooga-booga.

03:06.654 --> 03:09.089
It was scary when I was eight.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.525
It's even scarier now.

03:11.625 --> 03:14.262
But I want to see you
get out there again.

03:14.362 --> 03:17.265
Look, I just broke up
with Gary, I'm depressed.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.633
I'm tired and miserable.

03:19.733 --> 03:20.601
[gasping]

03:20.701 --> 03:23.404
I look so cute.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.439
(WITCH VOICE) I'll
get you my pretty.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.340
Hey!

03:26.440 --> 03:27.841
You look great.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.278
So scary.

03:30.378 --> 03:31.679
I need a broom.

03:31.779 --> 03:32.646
It's in the kitchen.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.117
Hey, hey, hey.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.752
Hey look everybody, DJ's witch.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.020
Woo, woo.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.222
Why don't you fly upstairs
and put on your PJs, huh?

03:42.323 --> 03:43.391
I can't fly without a broom.

03:43.491 --> 03:44.592
Sure you can.
Look.

03:44.692 --> 03:45.493
Whoo!

03:45.593 --> 03:46.460
There you go.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.562
But up in minute, champ.

03:48.662 --> 03:49.530
What?

03:49.630 --> 03:50.698
Two daughters isn't
enough for you.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.666
What are you talking about?

03:52.766 --> 03:56.069
He's dressed like a witch.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.137
Witches are girls.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.006
This is the 90s, Dan.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.974
Witches are women.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.943
I can't let him do this.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.679
He got to pick his own
costume, that's what he chose.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.381
Why couldn't he pick
up something normal,

04:07.481 --> 04:10.284
like a vampire, or
a nice axe murderer?

04:10.384 --> 04:11.919
Like, um, Lizzie Borden?

04:12.019 --> 04:13.086
There's plenty
other ax murderers

04:13.186 --> 04:14.322
in the world, Roseanne.

04:14.422 --> 04:15.689
Oh, yeah, I get it.

04:15.789 --> 04:19.460
You want him to be a manly,
feral, stud of an axe murderer.

04:19.560 --> 04:24.298
There's no little sissy axe
murderer for Dan Conner's boy.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.099
Boys shouldn't
dress up like girls.

04:26.199 --> 04:27.568
Now, Darlene dressed
up like a pirate

04:27.668 --> 04:28.569
for three years in a row.

04:28.669 --> 04:29.670
That was cute.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.938
If he goes out like
this, he's going to come

04:31.038 --> 04:32.239
home with a bloody nose.

04:32.340 --> 04:35.376
That is stupid.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.677
I've got to get back in there.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.379
Would you please talk to him.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.747
DJ!

04:39.847 --> 04:42.883
Instead of a witch, you want
to dress up like Madonna?

04:46.153 --> 04:48.021
I did my best.

04:48.121 --> 04:48.989
[laughing]

04:49.089 --> 04:51.425
[music playing]

04:53.561 --> 04:54.328
Yeah.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.330
Hi, Mom.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.998
Yeah?

04:58.098 --> 05:01.635
Well, so how long
you going to be?

05:01.735 --> 05:04.104
[laughing]

05:07.307 --> 05:08.409
OK.
Yeah.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.710
I'll tell him.
OK.

05:09.810 --> 05:10.611
Bye.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.314
Dad!

05:14.415 --> 05:15.916
Mom's still at work.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.785
She says she and Aunt
Jackie will meet us there.

05:17.885 --> 05:18.686
OK.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.253
I'll be right out.

05:20.354 --> 05:21.655
Darlene, you're
not even ready.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.524
We're going to be
leaving any minute.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.359
I don't feel so good.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.260
Well, what's wrong?

05:27.361 --> 05:28.496
It's my stomach.

05:28.596 --> 05:29.397
Oh!

05:29.497 --> 05:30.864
Oh my god!

05:30.964 --> 05:32.866
[screaming]

05:34.435 --> 05:36.404
[crying]

05:37.405 --> 05:38.271
So what do you want?

05:38.372 --> 05:40.340
Some Pepto Bismol, or something?

05:40.441 --> 05:42.776
[laughing]

05:43.411 --> 05:44.211
OK.

05:44.311 --> 05:45.679
Let's get going.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.153
Where's DJ?

05:53.253 --> 05:55.889
We'll get him.

05:55.989 --> 05:58.992
You don't look
half bad, toot.s

05:59.092 --> 06:01.395
Thank you.

06:01.495 --> 06:04.097
Listen, I was supposed to remind
you to bring the brownies.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.066
You hear that lamebrain,
you forgot the brownies.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.334
Boink.
Ow.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.168
Ow.
Ow.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.637
Hey, leave him alone.

06:09.737 --> 06:10.771
Wise guy, eh?

06:10.871 --> 06:11.739
Yeah.

06:11.839 --> 06:14.374
Woo, woo, woo,
woo, woo, woo, woo!

06:14.475 --> 06:16.076
All right, knock it off.

06:16.176 --> 06:18.011
[imitating smacking]

06:18.111 --> 06:20.448
[laughing]

06:23.984 --> 06:25.619
I'll get the brownies.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.121
[high pitched humming]

06:29.122 --> 06:30.591
Hey, hey, hey.

06:30.691 --> 06:31.692
What's this?

06:31.792 --> 06:32.626
It's DJ.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.628
Uh, yeah, I
thought you changed

06:34.728 --> 06:35.729
your mind about being a witch.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.030
No.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.198
Well, look, I've
been thinking,

06:38.298 --> 06:39.700
you know, the costume's
great and everything.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.736
Why not just say
you're a warlock.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.371
What's a warlock?

06:44.472 --> 06:46.039
It's a guy witch.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.140
- OK.
- Yeah.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.909
So let's get rid
of the broom here.

06:49.009 --> 06:49.843
Why?

06:49.943 --> 06:52.212
Warlocks don't have brooms.

06:52.312 --> 06:53.514
Well, then I
want to be a witch.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.248
No, no, no you don't, DJ.

06:55.348 --> 06:58.452
You see, witches are girls.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.387
Warlocks are guys.

07:00.488 --> 07:01.655
They can do anything
a witch can do.

07:01.755 --> 07:02.956
They can turn people into frogs.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.291
They make thunder and lightning.

07:04.391 --> 07:05.493
They can grant wishes.

07:05.593 --> 07:06.460
(EVIL VOICE) That's
a fairy godmother.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.360
Rawr.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.764
You're not helping.

07:10.864 --> 07:11.665
OK.

07:11.765 --> 07:12.866
Look, uh-- Oh!

07:12.966 --> 07:13.767
Hey!

07:13.867 --> 07:14.668
Look!

07:14.768 --> 07:15.769
[gasping]

07:15.869 --> 07:17.605
It's a magic wand.

07:17.705 --> 07:19.907
You take this and tell
people you're a wizard.

07:20.007 --> 07:20.874
I don't want it.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.576
I don't want anything.

07:22.676 --> 07:23.511
All right.

07:23.611 --> 07:24.411
Let's go.

07:28.381 --> 07:29.216
[banging]

07:29.316 --> 07:31.118
[laughing]

07:31.218 --> 07:33.687
Spread out! (FUNNY
VOICE) Certainly!

07:33.787 --> 07:35.155
[high pitched humming]

07:35.255 --> 07:37.558
[music playing]

07:43.396 --> 07:44.297
Come on, Roseanne.

07:44.397 --> 07:45.699
It's freezing outside.
ROSEANNE: No.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.300
I'm not going in there
dressed like this.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.802
Roseanne, you're
being ridiculous.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.971
Well, you took off
your nose and your ears.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.306
Well, you take
off your costume.

07:53.406 --> 07:54.908
No, I'll never get it back on.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.009
Just get in here.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.845
You look adorable.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.079
You really think so?

07:59.179 --> 08:02.015
Get in here.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.384
[laughing]

08:05.653 --> 08:06.453
Oh.

08:06.554 --> 08:07.921
I left my purse in the car.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.156
No!

08:09.256 --> 08:12.259
Look, you call Dan, and
we-- we can get out of here.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.367
I feel like I'm
having one of them

08:20.467 --> 08:21.702
dreams where you go
to school and you're

08:21.802 --> 08:23.671
only wearing your underwear.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.739
Roseanne, come
on, it's Halloween.

08:25.839 --> 08:26.974
What's the big deal?

08:27.074 --> 08:28.441
Because I'm the only
person in here in a costume.

08:32.546 --> 08:33.346
Hello?

08:33.446 --> 08:34.247
Who is this?

08:34.347 --> 08:35.783
Eddy?

08:35.883 --> 08:37.785
Oh, Arnie.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.754
Listen, is Dan around?

08:40.854 --> 08:42.122
Well, could you go
find him and tell him

08:42.222 --> 08:43.691
that the car broke
down on me and Jackie

08:43.791 --> 08:44.758
are stuck here at The Low Boy?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.026
He has to come and pick us up.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.562
And tell him to hurry it up.

08:48.662 --> 08:52.566
Trick or treat to
you too, Arnie.

08:52.666 --> 08:53.967
This is going to be a while.
We should wait in the car.

08:54.067 --> 08:54.868
No.

08:54.968 --> 08:55.836
It's freezing outside.

08:55.936 --> 08:56.870
Come on.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.005
I'll buy-- buy you a drink.
[sighing]

08:58.105 --> 08:58.906
OK.

09:03.276 --> 09:05.078
Little help?

09:05.178 --> 09:06.479
Yeah, what can I get
for you sweetheart.

09:06.580 --> 09:07.681
- I'll have a white wine.
- OK.

09:07.781 --> 09:08.582
What about you, fella?

09:12.853 --> 09:13.821
Come on, pal.

09:13.921 --> 09:14.722
I'm busy here.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.556
What are you drinking?

09:16.657 --> 09:18.358
Uh, give me a beer.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.727
[laughing]

09:19.827 --> 09:22.029
[music playing]

09:24.464 --> 09:25.833
Roseanne, don't do this.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.035
You're just going to
embarrass both of us.

09:28.135 --> 09:30.938
Call me Bob.

09:31.038 --> 09:36.343
White wine for the lady,
and a beer for you, pal.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.612
So how's the action in here.

09:41.749 --> 09:42.549
Action?

09:46.887 --> 09:47.688
Chicks.

09:50.624 --> 09:51.424
I--I don't know, fella.

09:51.524 --> 09:52.425
It's Tuesday night.

09:52.525 --> 09:54.061
Ladies bowling league
comes in at ten.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.996
10 o'clock, huh?

09:56.096 --> 09:59.099
Good thing I brought my
little squeezebox with me.

09:59.199 --> 10:03.904
Oh, oh, you're such a pig.

10:04.004 --> 10:09.242
Yeah, but that's why you
like me, right, honey bun?

10:09.342 --> 10:11.011
That'll be $4.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.112
Pay the man, doll.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.516
Well, why should I pay?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.385
You're the man, you pay.

10:18.485 --> 10:22.055
You know I left
my purse in the car.

10:22.155 --> 10:26.259
Oh, all right, I'll
pay for you again.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.829
I don't know why I always am
attracted to these losers.

10:30.798 --> 10:31.631
Gee.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.333
It must be her
time of the month.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.306
Now I know why you're single.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.641
You're such a lousy date.

10:41.742 --> 10:45.212
Look, Bob, I'm going
to go call Dan again.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.446
Fine.

10:46.546 --> 10:47.748
I'm going to mingle.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.016
No.
Don't.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.317
Don't.
You're not serious.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.119
Listen, me and the guys,
we're going to hang out.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.454
You got a problem
with that, babe?

10:54.554 --> 10:56.423
[laughing]

11:00.527 --> 11:04.798
Excuse me, you know,
you could do much better.

11:07.634 --> 11:10.303
I don't see you
here with anybody.

11:10.403 --> 11:11.772
You're kidding me.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.240
Honest to god.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.777
This broad was so hot I thought
she was going to kill me.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.511
Oh, man.

11:18.611 --> 11:19.412
Yeah.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.481
Bada bing, bada boom.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.450
[laughing]

11:23.550 --> 11:27.821
So then she brings out this
suitcase full of sex toys.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.522
And I'm thinking,
this broad is freaky.

11:29.622 --> 11:30.724
Oh, yeah.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.159
As long s you're getting
your battery charged,

11:32.259 --> 11:33.626
what's the damn difference?

11:33.727 --> 11:34.862
[laughing]

11:34.962 --> 11:36.830
Yeah, I mean, while you're
getting your car washed,

11:36.930 --> 11:38.932
you might as well get
the hot wax, right?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.333
Yeah.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.634
[laughing]

11:41.735 --> 11:42.836
Only thing I want
to know, is what

11:42.936 --> 11:44.071
does she want with
you when she's got

11:44.171 --> 11:45.672
a suitcase full of sex toys.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.611
That supposed to be a joke?

11:51.711 --> 11:52.512
OK.

11:55.615 --> 11:56.850
Oh.

11:56.950 --> 12:01.521
Well, anyway, we were
going pretty good.

12:01.621 --> 12:07.427
And I was catching my groove,
doing what makes me me.

12:07.527 --> 12:10.330
And then her roommate walks
in and says, can I join you?

12:10.430 --> 12:11.598
[laughing]

12:11.698 --> 12:12.699
Yeah, right.

12:16.603 --> 12:19.706
I mean, way to go.

12:19.807 --> 12:22.542
So then her roommate
takes off all her clothes,

12:22.642 --> 12:24.377
and I got both of
them to deal with.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.313
Hey, hold on a second.
Hold on now.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.215
Let me ask you this
question, all right?

12:28.315 --> 12:29.382
Yeah.
What?

12:29.482 --> 12:31.184
Are you making this
stuff up as you go along?

12:34.187 --> 12:36.689
You calling me a liar.

12:36.790 --> 12:37.590
No.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.661
Bada boom, bada bing.

12:41.761 --> 12:46.366
You know, I mean, long as
you're getting your cue chocked,

12:46.466 --> 12:47.935
it don't matter
what ball you hit.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.041
OK.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.775
Well, then just keep
an eye out for him, OK?

12:55.876 --> 12:56.877
(WHISPERED)
Hurry up, hurry up.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.545
All right.
Bye.

12:58.645 --> 12:59.947
What?
- Oh, man.

13:00.047 --> 13:00.914
What?

13:01.014 --> 13:01.849
Oh, man.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.384
It was awesome.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.854
Hey it reminds of that
movie where that lady hung

13:06.954 --> 13:09.489
out with the gorillas, but they
accept her as one of their own.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.024
Oh, cool.

13:11.124 --> 13:11.925
Yeah.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.726
What do they talk about?

13:13.827 --> 13:17.197
Well, OK, the head
gorilla, OK, he's

13:17.297 --> 13:19.299
like stand around telling
these sex stories.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.168
And the less dominant
gorillas are just

13:21.268 --> 13:24.037
standing around believing it.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.772
So what's so new about that?

13:25.873 --> 13:27.875
Well, I think I finally
figured out why they do it.

13:27.975 --> 13:28.775
Do

13:28.876 --> 13:29.977
Oh, do tell.

13:30.077 --> 13:33.046
Well, it's like, if one
of them actually has sex,

13:33.146 --> 13:35.983
then it seems like maybe the
rest of them have a chance too.

13:36.083 --> 13:36.884
Oh.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.285
So you think that's it, huh?

13:38.385 --> 13:39.352
Oh, yeah.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.254
It gives them a feeling
of hope and pride.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.655
[laughing]

13:43.656 --> 13:44.691
Hey, order me another beer.

13:44.791 --> 13:45.592
I'll be right back.

13:45.692 --> 13:46.693
Why where are you going?

13:46.793 --> 13:47.895
- I'm going to the men's room.
- No.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.362
Don't-- Roseanne,
please don't do it.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.864
Please don't do anything.

13:50.964 --> 13:51.831
Don't do it.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.000
No, come on.
Come on.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.567
I'm just going to go
update your phone number.

14:00.107 --> 14:01.241
God it stinks in here.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.714
[music playing]

14:21.228 --> 14:23.630
[screaming]

14:25.698 --> 14:29.069
Give me a break.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.138
How are you
doing, Mr. Thompson?

14:31.238 --> 14:32.039
Hi, girls.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.048
[laughing]

14:42.215 --> 14:43.083
Gah.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.918
This was even lamer
than last year.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.153
Yeah.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.188
But you see that Freddy
Krueger guy checking me out?

14:51.124 --> 14:55.695
Beck-head, there were
19 Freddy Kruegers?

14:55.795 --> 14:57.764
Which one were you referring to?

14:57.864 --> 14:59.732
The cute one.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.434
[laughing]

15:01.534 --> 15:04.304
This is just great.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.572
Yo, Dan.
Hey.

15:05.672 --> 15:06.806
- Yeah.
- Rosie called.

15:06.906 --> 15:07.874
Her car broke down.

15:07.975 --> 15:08.908
She and Jackie are
stuck at The Low Boy.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.410
And they need you
to pick them up.

15:10.510 --> 15:11.378
Aw, man.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.246
That stupid car.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.214
Hey, Arn.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.648
Yo.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.185
I-- Who are you
supposed to be?

15:18.285 --> 15:19.086
Pfft.

15:19.186 --> 15:19.987
[laughing]

15:20.087 --> 15:23.556
I'm Elvis' ghost, man.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.993
[laughing]

15:30.930 --> 15:32.932
Listen, um, let's
go pick up your mom.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.034
Where's DJ.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.335
Last time I saw him
he was in the chamber

15:35.435 --> 15:38.038
of everlasting horror.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.373
Yeah, whining about
that stupid broom.

15:40.473 --> 15:41.274
Oh, jeez.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.409
You guys wait here, OK?

15:44.844 --> 15:46.613
DJ.

15:46.713 --> 15:47.514
DJ?

15:47.614 --> 15:48.448
[grunting]

15:48.548 --> 15:49.349
Hey, Jimmy.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.717
You seen DJ?

15:50.817 --> 15:53.486
Nah, Dan, I haven't seen him.

15:53.586 --> 15:54.988
DJ?

15:55.088 --> 15:56.089
DJ?

15:56.189 --> 15:56.990
DJ?

15:57.090 --> 15:58.891
[howling]

16:00.860 --> 16:02.662
Hey, Andy.

16:02.762 --> 16:03.963
You seen my boy?

16:04.064 --> 16:05.298
He's dressed up like a wi--

16:05.398 --> 16:06.766
wizard.

16:06.866 --> 16:07.867
Give it up, Dan.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.002
The kid's a witch.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.770
- Andy, Andy.
- What?

16:10.870 --> 16:11.704
You've got three boys.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.206
This is just a phase, right?

16:13.306 --> 16:14.407
Oh, yeah.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.543
Kid hits a certain age,
he does some weird stuff.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.345
You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

16:18.445 --> 16:19.579
I think DJ's hiding from me.

16:19.679 --> 16:20.913
I probably traumatized.

16:21.014 --> 16:22.215
Poor kid.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.717
All he wanted was a broom
so he could pretend to fly.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.886
That probably means he
wants to be a pilot, right?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.221
Dan, Dan, Dan.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.358
You can't go turning everything
a kid does into a career.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.259
All right?

16:32.359 --> 16:33.326
Believe me.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.894
It means more to you
than it does to him.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.896
But if he keeps this up
some kid's going to come along

16:36.996 --> 16:37.897
and deck him.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.367
Come on, we were
kids, we survived.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.435
Look at us now.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.871
DJ: Dad!

16:44.971 --> 16:45.838
[creaking]

16:45.938 --> 16:47.774
DJ?

16:47.874 --> 16:48.741
Dad?

16:48.841 --> 16:50.510
DJ.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.145
Where you been, boy?

16:52.245 --> 16:53.080
Scaring people.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.047
Yeah.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.382
Well you scared
the heck out of me,

16:55.482 --> 16:56.383
I didn't know where you were.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.518
You mad at me?

16:58.618 --> 16:59.419
Nah.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.453
You mad at me?

17:00.553 --> 17:01.354
Nah.

17:01.454 --> 17:02.289
All right.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.257
Let's go get your broom.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.558
[laughing]

17:05.658 --> 17:08.928
Yeah, every time my
old lady starts giving me

17:09.028 --> 17:11.431
that crap about men women being
equal, see I just tell her,

17:11.531 --> 17:12.499
you're so equal?

17:12.599 --> 17:14.834
Well, let's see you
pee out a camp fire.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.336
[laughing]

17:17.904 --> 17:19.772
Hey, uh, Bob.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.743
Looks like your old lady
just found a new fireman.

17:23.843 --> 17:27.347
Yeah, well, uh, we got
an open relationship, see.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.349
That cause you can't
keep her in line?

17:29.449 --> 17:33.019
Well, it's hard to control
a woman who ain't inflatable.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.388
[laughing]

17:35.488 --> 17:37.257
[coughing]

17:38.691 --> 17:39.492
Yo, bitch.

17:45.198 --> 17:48.401
You are making me look bad
in front of the other guys.

17:48.501 --> 17:51.070
Uh, hey, I don't see
any ring on this finger.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.210
Hi Jackie.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.178
Crystal?

17:58.278 --> 17:59.312
What are you doing here?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.514
I'm here to drown my sorrows.

18:01.614 --> 18:05.818
Willy, get me a pink squirrel,
and keep them coming.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.755
I just had a terrible date
and it's all my fault.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.056
I could have ordered
the chicken, which

18:10.157 --> 18:11.758
was reasonably priced but no.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.860
I had to have the surf
and turf, which clearly

18:13.960 --> 18:15.828
signaled I owed him something.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.631
And then when I was not
accommodating he dumped me.

18:18.731 --> 18:22.169
Well, could you stop blaming
yourself for everything?

18:22.269 --> 18:24.171
You got a right to
eat without letting

18:24.271 --> 18:25.705
some guy put you on the menu.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.240
You're better than that Crystal.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.141
Really?

18:28.241 --> 18:29.942
Yes, really.

18:30.042 --> 18:31.611
You are a quality woman.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.079
And you've got to keep
telling yourself that

18:33.180 --> 18:36.516
and stop judging yourself
according to what men think.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.118
What's your name?

18:39.219 --> 18:41.120
[laughing]

18:48.195 --> 18:50.230
Don't you recognize me?

18:50.330 --> 18:52.265
Well, refresh my memory.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.069
Where might we have met.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.705
At Roseanne's house.

18:58.805 --> 18:59.606
Roseanne?

19:03.243 --> 19:05.178
Trick or treat.

19:05.278 --> 19:08.715
Well-- Well, of course
I knew it was you.

19:08.815 --> 19:09.849
No you did not.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.050
I was playing along.

19:11.150 --> 19:11.951
No.

19:12.051 --> 19:13.386
You were ready to sleep with me.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.424
Well, I was going to make
you buy me dinner first.

19:19.759 --> 19:20.660
[laughing]

19:20.760 --> 19:22.795
Hello, girls.

19:22.895 --> 19:23.696
Bob.

19:26.266 --> 19:31.604
Hey, of course you ladies
recognize Warren Beatty.

19:31.704 --> 19:32.939
Want to dance?

19:33.039 --> 19:34.707
I'm talking with my friends.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.108
Maybe some other time.

19:36.209 --> 19:38.711
What, you'd rather sit there
with Burl Ives than dance

19:38.811 --> 19:39.946
with me?

19:40.046 --> 19:41.581
Come on, let's dance.

19:41.681 --> 19:42.882
No, thank you.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.852
Well I'm not going to bit
you, unless you want me to.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.119
Oh, oh, hardi-har-har.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.590
Hey, nobody's talking to you.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.392
Come on.
Let's dance.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.494
- No leave her alone.
- Well I-- it's all right.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.028
I'll dance with him.
- You will not.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.264
Just sit down!

19:57.364 --> 19:59.699
You know, I'm sick to
you, you've been in my face

19:59.799 --> 20:00.700
all night.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.902
Look, why don't
you just take a hike.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.604
Yeah, who's going to make me?

20:04.704 --> 20:06.273
Oh yeah, that's real grown up.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.374
Fight about it.

20:07.474 --> 20:08.741
Fine with me.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.443
Come on fat boy,
let's take it outside.

20:12.945 --> 20:16.249
Well she-- she started it.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.149
OK.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.050
OK.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.487
I have to tell you something.

20:20.587 --> 20:21.754
I'm a woman.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.624
Yeah, you're going to be
when I get done with you.

20:24.724 --> 20:25.558
Hey!

20:25.658 --> 20:26.859
Leave him alone.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.295
What's it to you?

20:28.395 --> 20:29.496
He's my husband.

20:35.768 --> 20:36.536
What?

20:36.636 --> 20:38.037
You heard me.

20:38.137 --> 20:41.808
Anybody that messes with
him, messes with me.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.210
[laughing]

20:51.017 --> 20:53.953
Would you want to mess with me?

20:54.053 --> 20:57.023
No way.

20:57.123 --> 20:58.591
Oh, my hero.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.396
Oh here's a real man for you.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.297
[spitting]

21:04.397 --> 21:06.399
That beard kind of tickles.

21:06.499 --> 21:09.168
Bada boom, bada bing.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.169
[laughing]

21:10.269 --> 21:11.170
[music playing]

21:11.270 --> 21:13.640
[applause]

21:16.242 --> 21:18.378
[high pitched humming]

21:22.482 --> 21:24.551
Hey, quite breathing on me.

21:24.651 --> 21:27.153
I ain't breathing on you.

21:27.253 --> 21:28.120
Neh.

21:28.220 --> 21:30.122
What was that for?

21:30.222 --> 21:31.924
Quit slobbering
on me, would you?

21:32.024 --> 21:33.426
Oh, yeah I--

21:33.526 --> 21:34.394
[grunting]

21:34.494 --> 21:36.363
[barking]

21:37.430 --> 21:39.298
[applause]

21:39.399 --> 21:41.233
[high pitched humming]

21:43.302 --> 21:45.137
[screaming]

21:45.237 --> 21:46.373
Hey, Andie.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.574
Hey, Dan.

21:47.674 --> 21:50.309
[high pitched humming]
