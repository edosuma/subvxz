00:08.240 --> 00:11.320
[Richard] Welcome to the real America.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.680
[grunts]

00:12.760 --> 00:14.240
[Cornelia] What did he do?

00:14.320 --> 00:16.000
Just the color of his skin.

00:16.400 --> 00:19.840
[Cornelia] You and I, how we met.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.880
It was in the stars.

00:22.840 --> 00:24.320
[lead horseman] Where are you headed?

00:24.400 --> 00:27.040
[Cornelia] Caine County, Wyoming.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.560
[Eli] I've lived here my whole life.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.800
I've seen hell, and I made hell.

00:30.880 --> 00:31.880
-[shotgun cocks]
-[gunshot]

00:31.960 --> 00:33.320
[man grunts]

00:33.400 --> 00:34.440
[Cam] What you gonna do now?

00:34.480 --> 00:35.480
Nebraska.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.000
That ain't Pawnee land no more.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.200
Don't want it all. Just a few acres.

00:39.760 --> 00:43.560
Gadding about
with all that unbanked cash.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.320
[Cornelia] You're gonna kill me?

00:46.400 --> 00:47.680
[Richard] Yup.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.400
[knife stabs]

00:49.480 --> 00:52.200
[Cornelia] Without you,
I'd have been killed.

00:53.280 --> 00:55.720
My son, he is dead.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.120
And up on Powder River,

00:57.200 --> 00:59.880
there is a man
trying to forget that he ever existed.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.920
Will you help me? Please?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.040
Can you shoot?

01:03.120 --> 01:04.440
If I have to.

01:04.520 --> 01:05.960
Oh, you'll have to.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
[dramatic music playing]

01:13.720 --> 01:16.680
-[man] Come on. Rub that dang ball.
-[clacking noises]

01:16.760 --> 01:18.560
[man] Put your back into it.

01:18.640 --> 01:21.080
[man] Come on. Move that thing. Come on.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.760
[man] You hit it good, Mr. Trafford.

01:31.640 --> 01:34.000
[man] I got it! I got it! Yeah!

01:34.080 --> 01:36.280
Hey, you gotta hold it up.

01:37.320 --> 01:40.320
[dramatic music playing]

01:48.960 --> 01:49.960
[Thomas] What?

01:50.440 --> 01:52.600
[Thin Kelly] Best see for yourself.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.680
[dramatic music playing]

02:27.440 --> 02:30.360
[man grunting]

02:30.440 --> 02:33.440
[dramatic music playing]

02:41.160 --> 02:43.160
[man grunts]

02:44.840 --> 02:47.840
[dramatic music playing]

02:49.480 --> 02:50.560
Show me.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.640
[dramatic music playing]

04:07.520 --> 04:09.240
[indistinct chatter]

04:15.920 --> 04:17.960
-Sheriff?
-Mr. Trafford.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.960
Actually, I'm an Honorable,
but I'll let it slide.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.040
I would.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.120
In this country,
you gotta earn your titles,

04:25.200 --> 04:26.920
not just get born with.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
And so how must that feel,
Sheriff Marshall?

04:29.080 --> 04:30.600
To have a surname exceed your station?

04:30.680 --> 04:32.720
Always looking to better me self.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.520
The American way.

04:35.600 --> 04:36.880
You even arrested anyone yet?

04:36.920 --> 04:39.720
Remarkably civic-minded lot.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.120
That right?

04:41.800 --> 04:45.800
[dramatic music playing]

04:48.440 --> 04:49.480
What about this?

04:49.560 --> 04:52.080
[dramatic music playing]

04:57.320 --> 04:58.360
What is it?

04:58.440 --> 05:00.120
That, Sheriff Marshall,

05:00.200 --> 05:03.680
is a 13-week gestated
prized Longhorn Hereford cross.

05:04.360 --> 05:07.200
I imported the bull from England,
a huge expense.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.760
Jesus, I'm sorry to hear that.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.160
Hundred more lying up there.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.000
All ripped out the same.

05:14.680 --> 05:15.800
By what?

05:15.880 --> 05:18.360
Oh, no, um, by whom.

05:20.560 --> 05:21.800
-Your people.
-Mine?

05:21.880 --> 05:23.240
Homesteaders,

05:23.320 --> 05:25.680
sod-busters, pig fuckers.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.760
Not my people.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.400
But they're the ones
who pay your bills, Sheriff.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.840
You're not part of this community.

05:29.920 --> 05:31.800
We had law and order
long before you lot got here.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.400
Your law.

05:33.480 --> 05:34.480
Your order.

05:34.560 --> 05:35.920
I opened this place up.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.160
Me.

05:38.240 --> 05:39.240
Alone.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.000
But now, it's just every...

05:42.920 --> 05:45.320
Mick, Spik, Paddy,
and Wop who thinks he can follow suit.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.720
And this, this is how they do it!

05:47.800 --> 05:51.880
[dramatic music playing]

05:51.960 --> 05:53.400
Your people
are trying to drive me off my land.

05:53.480 --> 05:54.840
-Your land?
-All of it.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.880
Maybe you should check the statutes.

05:56.960 --> 06:01.040
You're grazing public land,
Mister Honorable.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.480
[Thomas] Which I made.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.200
You English...

06:07.560 --> 06:10.520
I think maybe it was God that done that.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.120
See, and yet-- and yet,
now all your people...

06:13.880 --> 06:16.560
want to do is cut it up in barbed wire!

06:19.400 --> 06:21.600
Is that really the future
you're waiting for, Sheriff?

06:27.160 --> 06:28.680
[man grunts]

06:32.320 --> 06:33.520
Who's your man?

06:33.600 --> 06:34.600
Night watch.

06:35.880 --> 06:37.800
-He see anything?
-Does it look like he did?

06:38.880 --> 06:40.240
[Sheriff Marshall] I'd like to
have a talk with him

06:40.320 --> 06:42.560
once he's got his jaw back on.

06:42.640 --> 06:43.640
What for?

06:43.720 --> 06:45.880
He works for me,
just like you work for them.

06:47.560 --> 06:48.560
Kel?

06:49.720 --> 06:51.520
You read this the same?

06:51.600 --> 06:52.640
Maybe.

06:52.720 --> 06:53.960
But maybe not.

06:54.040 --> 06:57.640
Sod-busters,
they're up to shoot or rustle.

06:57.720 --> 06:58.760
Meat or money.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.360
But these...

07:01.280 --> 07:03.160
they just been sliced up and left.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.240
Wolf?

07:04.320 --> 07:05.440
What kind of wolf does that?

07:05.520 --> 07:07.680
Not any animal I ever heard of.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.240
Then what?

07:09.320 --> 07:11.280
Sand Creek, '64.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.160
Heard something similar.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.240
That was against Cheyenne.

07:16.320 --> 07:17.920
Killing pregnant women?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.680
-Yeah.
-You think this is Indians?

07:19.760 --> 07:21.240
Nope.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.280
They don't read like no pig-farmer.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.040
And it certainly weren't no wolf.

07:28.160 --> 07:32.920
What kinda community
you got going on up here, Sheriff,

07:33.000 --> 07:34.320
do a thing like that?

07:35.760 --> 07:37.120
[Thomas] Jesus, man.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.720
Even you can see the answer to that.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.800
[dramatic music playing]

07:51.880 --> 07:54.880
[crickets chirping]

08:20.880 --> 08:22.400
It doesn't matter
how many times you ask me,

08:22.480 --> 08:24.160
I won't tell you.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.760
[sighs] You're right.

08:33.680 --> 08:38.280
If wishes were where we would be,
then we would be where we are not.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.960
[Eli] Not a wish.

08:45.720 --> 08:46.880
A message.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.480
Who from?

08:48.520 --> 08:49.600
It comes in a dream.

08:49.640 --> 08:50.840
[Cornelia] Oh, yes?

08:52.000 --> 08:53.880
My dreams are wild.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.520
Then you go to a Gudehus.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.240
[Cornelia] What's that?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.200
An elder.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.880
Helps you understand.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.080
I'm not sure
he'd like what he finds.

09:05.160 --> 09:06.280
No, he's dead.

09:07.760 --> 09:11.120
They all are, up there now.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.200
[Cornelia] Where?

09:13.880 --> 09:15.200
[Eli] Path of the dead.

09:15.280 --> 09:16.520
[Cornelia] The Milky Way?

09:17.240 --> 09:18.240
Hmm...

09:19.280 --> 09:21.520
Maybe that's them
trying to send you a message.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.240
What'd be the point in that?

09:23.320 --> 09:25.720
Well, you won't know
until you find out what it means.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.080
But if they are up there
and I'm down here,

09:28.160 --> 09:29.600
who's left to tell me?

09:31.040 --> 09:34.040
[gentle music playing]

09:37.720 --> 09:38.880
It's busy tonight.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.960
[gentle music playing]

09:44.440 --> 09:47.440
[man] [praying foreign language]

09:59.120 --> 10:00.120
Amen.

10:00.880 --> 10:03.760
See, this is my point.

10:04.880 --> 10:06.760
It's against the laws of nature.

10:06.880 --> 10:10.880
Why else you think animals travel by herd?

10:11.000 --> 10:14.960
So it makes it harder
for the predator to choose.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.880
But you, out here all alone?

10:17.960 --> 10:19.840
Only yourself to blame.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.000
[speaking foreign language]

10:21.080 --> 10:22.640
-Huh?
-[speaking foreign language]

10:22.760 --> 10:24.640
-What you saying?
-[speaking foreign language]

10:24.720 --> 10:26.520
And what is the point,
coming to a country

10:26.640 --> 10:28.760
when you can't even begin
to speak its language.

10:28.840 --> 10:32.040
English, all right? Speak in English.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.880
[speaking foreign language]

10:36.000 --> 10:37.480
[Captain Clegg] Your whiff?

10:38.640 --> 10:40.320
[speaking foreign language]

10:40.400 --> 10:41.880
No.

10:41.960 --> 10:43.480
[speaking foreign language]

10:47.360 --> 10:49.400
Your whiff is fat.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.640
[speaking foreign language]

10:53.720 --> 10:54.760
Oh.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.240
Pregnant?

10:58.320 --> 11:00.480
-Your wife is pregnant?
-Yeah!

11:02.240 --> 11:04.240
Why didn't anyone tell me?

11:05.280 --> 11:06.320
That ain't right.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.840
Death, so close to new life.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.600
Not now, that is the wrong way around.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.400
I am so sorry.

11:13.480 --> 11:14.880
Truly.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.200
It's an awful thing.

11:20.960 --> 11:22.360
Go on.

11:22.440 --> 11:25.440
[dramatic music playing]

11:26.920 --> 11:28.440
You get back to her.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.200
Go back to your whiff.

11:35.120 --> 11:38.120
[dramatic music playing]

11:51.000 --> 11:53.960
You gonna let him go?

11:54.040 --> 11:55.400
[Captain Clegg] No.

11:55.480 --> 11:58.440
But when you put an arrow
through his heart,

11:58.520 --> 12:00.080
at least it will be full of hope.

12:00.160 --> 12:03.160
[dramatic music playing]

12:11.560 --> 12:14.160
[panting]

12:14.240 --> 12:17.240
[dramatic music playing]

12:24.400 --> 12:26.520
[arrow pierces]

12:26.600 --> 12:29.600
[dramatic music playing]

13:04.520 --> 13:05.920
You missed his heart.

13:09.840 --> 13:12.840
[wind blowing]

13:51.960 --> 13:53.040
You all right?

13:53.120 --> 13:54.800
[Cornelia] Oh, yes.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.360
What's this?

13:56.440 --> 13:57.560
[Eli] West.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.800
East.

14:02.160 --> 14:03.200
South.

14:07.800 --> 14:08.800
North.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.800
For you, if we get split.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.240
Not for you?

14:17.880 --> 14:20.280
My people lived here over 2,000 years.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.400
No need for sticks.

14:23.880 --> 14:24.960
What's up there for you?

14:25.040 --> 14:27.160
-Land claim.
-[Cornelia] Where?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.800
-Nebraska.
-Is that far?

14:29.880 --> 14:31.720
Not as far as you wanna go.

14:33.920 --> 14:36.000
How come you came from the South?

14:37.480 --> 14:38.560
Well...

14:40.840 --> 14:44.000
Should've left from Liverpool
and I get that now.

14:44.080 --> 14:47.120
But, um, Southampton was closest,

14:47.200 --> 14:50.280
so that's how I ended up in New Orleans.

14:53.440 --> 14:56.280
[dramatic music playing]

14:57.320 --> 14:58.560
The thing was, I was in a bit of a hurry

14:58.640 --> 15:01.480
and my son had just died, so...

15:02.840 --> 15:05.000
so my mind was foggy.

15:06.560 --> 15:09.880
Not foggy.
It was more, um...

15:09.960 --> 15:12.680
it was more--
I don't really know what it was.

15:12.760 --> 15:14.480
Or is, really. But, um...

15:15.920 --> 15:17.360
but the man responsible is here,

15:17.440 --> 15:20.480
so here is where I must be...

15:20.560 --> 15:21.560
or at least up there.

15:21.640 --> 15:24.560
[dramatic music playing]

15:28.600 --> 15:29.600
Well, at least you can ride.

15:29.680 --> 15:30.760
[Cornelia] And shoot.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.200
Big difference between shooting
a pig and a man.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.560
Especially when the pig
hadn't done me any harm.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.320
[Cornelia] I'm good
with a bow and arrow, too.

15:44.040 --> 15:47.080
I can strike a bullseye at 200 feet.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.000
In England, we call it Toxophily.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.360
It's quite the fashion.

15:54.440 --> 15:55.840
Maybe I should go.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.080
Ooh, no.

15:57.160 --> 15:58.920
Look what happened to Pocahontas.

15:59.640 --> 16:00.680
Who?

16:02.960 --> 16:05.240
[Cornelia] You follow the stars at night.

16:05.320 --> 16:06.600
[Eli] Yup.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.080
[Cornelia] Will you teach me?

16:08.760 --> 16:09.760
[Eli] No.

16:09.840 --> 16:12.600
[Cornelia] Well, you told me
about Death Path.

16:12.680 --> 16:13.880
[Eli] Yeah, well, I shouldn't have.

16:13.960 --> 16:15.680
[Cornelia] I like that idea.

16:16.920 --> 16:20.720
Being able to see your way
into the next world.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.640
Makes this one seem less final.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.840
Is that where your family is?

16:28.480 --> 16:29.480
And my boy?

16:29.560 --> 16:32.560
[dramatic music playing]

16:44.280 --> 16:45.680
He die violent or ill?

16:45.760 --> 16:47.160
Why?

16:47.240 --> 16:50.880
Violent takes a short road,
illness, the long.

16:53.760 --> 16:54.840
Which one did yours?

16:55.560 --> 16:56.920
Short, mostly.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.080
-Long, some.
-What if it was both?

17:04.440 --> 17:05.960
The English gave us...

17:08.920 --> 17:10.400
all kinds of illness.

17:12.440 --> 17:15.720
Some say that-- that's the short.

17:17.760 --> 17:18.880
Others, long.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.080
What do you say?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Short.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.000
Violent.

17:28.320 --> 17:30.800
Well then, you and I,
we're looking at the same road.

17:32.440 --> 17:35.440
[dramatic music playing]

17:40.880 --> 17:42.240
[Eli] I'm not sure.

17:42.320 --> 17:43.920
Kickapoo maybe.

17:45.560 --> 17:46.760
Tribal lands?

17:46.800 --> 17:48.240
Allotments.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.400
[dramatic music playing]

18:07.200 --> 18:10.480
[water pattering]

18:12.880 --> 18:16.800
[dramatic music playing]

18:29.080 --> 18:30.560
What?

18:31.640 --> 18:33.080
We're being followed?

18:37.040 --> 18:38.560
Only one way to find out.

18:41.400 --> 18:44.400
[tense music playing]

19:04.240 --> 19:09.680
[speaking in foreign language]

19:09.760 --> 19:11.280
Is he a friend?

19:11.320 --> 19:13.200
Of mine?

19:13.280 --> 19:14.800
Maybe.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.240
Of yours?

19:20.920 --> 19:24.800
[dramatic music playing]

19:24.880 --> 19:26.560
[Eli] Take out your rifle.
Ratchet a bullet.

19:26.680 --> 19:28.000
[cocks gun]

19:30.160 --> 19:32.040
If it comes to it,
I'll take the two on the left,

19:32.080 --> 19:33.560
you gut-shoot the Pawnee's horse.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.440
-[shotgun cocks]
-His horse?

19:35.520 --> 19:37.320
Oh, you getting picky now?

19:39.480 --> 19:41.960
If I go down,
the scrub's your only chance.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.680
But then if I go down...

19:43.760 --> 19:45.280
I haven't really got one.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.400
Steady is quick.

19:51.080 --> 19:54.080
[tense music playing]

20:00.480 --> 20:02.320
Trooper Charlie White.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.520
[speaking in foreign language]
We fought together in Cheyenne County.

20:06.240 --> 20:07.320
Long time back.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.480
You don't remember me?

20:12.680 --> 20:14.560
You fought well.

20:14.640 --> 20:17.320
Thank you, brother.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.520
[tense music playing]

20:20.560 --> 20:23.080
[Eli, in English] That why you didn't try
and jump us back there?

20:23.160 --> 20:26.920
[Charlie] Captain Clegg here,
he wanted to meet you.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.560
Often's the time, Charlie here

20:29.680 --> 20:33.160
warms our campfire
with your heroic exploits.

20:33.240 --> 20:34.920
Tall tales on a short story.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.880
Make it longer,
if you care to join us.

20:40.160 --> 20:43.160
[tense music playing]

20:45.680 --> 20:46.720
Bushwhackin'?

20:48.960 --> 20:50.800
Pays better than an army pension.

20:50.880 --> 20:55.320
Which, anyways, you can't claim,
given the nature of your skin and all.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.960
Pays even shares.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.520
Don't go sayin' it's a livin'.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.480
[Charlie] It's survivin'.

21:01.560 --> 21:04.680
That living, ain't meant
for the likes of you and me.

21:08.320 --> 21:11.160
Unless, of course, you got other ideas.

21:11.240 --> 21:15.720
Just go my own way,
let you go on yours.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.680
What's in her bags?

21:21.760 --> 21:24.240
[tense music playing]

21:26.640 --> 21:28.000
Nothin' worth dyin' for.

21:30.640 --> 21:33.800
[laughs] So hand them over.

21:39.320 --> 21:40.800
Well...

21:42.320 --> 21:45.040
It's the natural order of things,
ain't it?

21:45.080 --> 21:49.000
It's like being a military hero

21:49.080 --> 21:52.680
from a breed we was all just looking
to wipe off the face of the earth.

21:54.440 --> 21:57.520
Now, the last man in your position,

21:58.520 --> 22:00.400
all he could do was pray.

22:02.440 --> 22:03.800
And here we are.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.440
[tense music playing]

22:17.240 --> 22:19.040
Just give him the damn bags.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.320
[tense music playing]

22:53.680 --> 22:54.920
[gunshot]

22:55.000 --> 22:58.080

[coyote barks]

24:52.080 --> 24:53.160
[gun cocks]

24:58.160 --> 25:00.200
They didn't make the mess.

25:00.280 --> 25:01.600
Just cleanin' it up.

25:13.840 --> 25:16.840
[dramatic music playing]

25:38.600 --> 25:39.800
Oh, my God.

25:41.840 --> 25:42.960
Too late for her.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.640
-But I can try for the child.
-The baby's alive?

25:51.760 --> 25:52.760
Weak.

25:54.200 --> 25:57.360
Done it before, but only for horses.

25:57.440 --> 26:00.600
Oh, God, you've got to save it.
Please save the baby.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.240
Go look for some sugar.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.760
[suspenseful music playing]

26:25.800 --> 26:26.880
It's all right.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.080
Come here.

26:32.160 --> 26:33.480
Come here.

26:33.560 --> 26:34.640
It's all right.

26:41.120 --> 26:42.480
Hold on to me.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.560
All right.

26:43.640 --> 26:44.800
I have you.

26:44.880 --> 26:45.920
All right.

26:47.640 --> 26:48.640
It's all right.

26:48.720 --> 26:51.720
[baby crying]

27:34.280 --> 27:35.520
Come on.

27:37.600 --> 27:40.040
All right. You do it.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.560
-I'm not a midwife.
-[Cornelia] Well, neither am I.

27:42.640 --> 27:45.760
Hold it to your atu,
your milk will come on.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.560
No.

27:47.640 --> 27:51.360
I couldn't. I mean, I can't.

27:52.640 --> 27:54.160
You don't want it?

27:54.240 --> 27:57.120
Their mother is not yet cold in her grave.

27:58.280 --> 27:59.280
Please.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.320
It won't last a week on sugar water.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.080
Well, then we have to get her to a doctor.

28:10.160 --> 28:12.440
-Out here?
-Somewhere safe for the both of them.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.920
With that money, travel north,
buy a spread, safe enough?

28:15.000 --> 28:16.680
No, I don't. I don't want--

28:16.760 --> 28:20.720
I-- and I couldn't be...

28:20.800 --> 28:21.800
A mother?

28:26.520 --> 28:27.680
I am a mother.

28:29.280 --> 28:30.360
I'm just not theirs.

28:30.440 --> 28:31.640
You lost a child.

28:31.720 --> 28:33.080
Now you got another.

28:33.160 --> 28:34.880
Well, you lost a family,
so I could say the same.

28:35.680 --> 28:36.680
With you?

28:36.760 --> 28:38.840
No, no.

28:38.920 --> 28:42.560
I was merely reversing the argument.

28:42.640 --> 28:44.480
[coyotes barking]

28:47.600 --> 28:48.960
We should've left them to it.

28:52.760 --> 28:54.800
I noticed this about you.

28:54.880 --> 28:58.080
You keep saying these negative things

28:58.160 --> 28:59.960
and you end up always doing the opposite.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.280
Hmm, well...

29:03.800 --> 29:05.840
Maybe I should start listening to myself.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.240
[baby cooing]

29:24.160 --> 29:25.720
You don't talk about that fight.

29:30.120 --> 29:32.760
-Most people did nothing but--
-[Cornelia] Do you want to?

29:32.840 --> 29:35.560
Things were hit.
Things were missed. About it.

29:37.360 --> 29:38.920
Is this part of your military training?

29:41.760 --> 29:43.320
But you were in the army?

29:43.400 --> 29:45.080
-[Eli] Yup.
-The American Army?

29:46.120 --> 29:48.120
-Calvary.
-So, like a conscript?

29:50.720 --> 29:51.920
Joined up.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.240
[Cornelia] Of choice?

29:54.320 --> 29:55.320
Got enemies.

29:55.400 --> 29:56.640
Who?

29:56.720 --> 30:00.320
Sioux, Cheyenne,
Arapaho, Comanche, Osage, Kansas.

30:01.600 --> 30:02.640
A few.

30:02.720 --> 30:03.840
A lot.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.200
Why?

30:06.280 --> 30:09.120
Some of it, long time.

30:09.200 --> 30:10.200
Some of it...

30:10.840 --> 30:11.840
Because of us?

30:14.000 --> 30:16.920
Not looking for blame, favors neither.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.600
Well, then what?

30:18.680 --> 30:20.120
Just a piece of land.

30:22.480 --> 30:25.400
The same thing happened to my father.

30:25.480 --> 30:28.800
And they gave him
a peerage and half of Devon.

30:29.520 --> 30:30.560
[Eli] Devon big?

30:32.720 --> 30:34.880
I mean, in your terms, probably not.

30:36.120 --> 30:37.680
I just need a few acres.

30:37.760 --> 30:38.920
Hmm.

30:41.320 --> 30:43.520
[Eli] Your father, soldier?

30:44.680 --> 30:45.680
Yup.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.000
Figures.

30:48.880 --> 30:49.880
Why?

30:51.280 --> 30:52.840
That where you live, with your folk?

30:56.400 --> 30:58.400
Hmm, but not in the main house.

30:58.480 --> 31:00.200
It was in a different...

31:00.280 --> 31:02.360
separate part of the grounds.

31:03.480 --> 31:04.600
With your boy?

31:04.680 --> 31:05.800
Yes.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.440
Uh-hmm.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.040
Well, you can ask if you want.

31:18.440 --> 31:19.480
I don't.

31:26.160 --> 31:27.800
My father was much the same.

31:29.240 --> 31:33.000
Only ask a question
if the outcome is uncertain.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.760
About right.

31:38.520 --> 31:43.200
Well, maybe that's what
made him such a good soldier.

31:45.600 --> 31:46.640
Like you.

31:47.480 --> 31:48.480
Not me.

31:49.080 --> 31:51.040
That trooper told stories about you.

31:51.120 --> 31:53.960
-Nothing to write home about.
-Except obviously people did.

31:54.040 --> 31:55.360
No point in that.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.160
We don't read, never did.

32:00.440 --> 32:01.680
You think that's wrong?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.720
-Like an animal?
-No, no.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.600
Um, it's just, how do you keep a record
of everything?

32:07.680 --> 32:09.600
What we said to each other?

32:09.680 --> 32:11.200
Well, you don't talk much.

32:11.280 --> 32:12.840
-Learned not to.
-[Cornelia] Why?

32:20.480 --> 32:22.760
But in the before-time, nothing but.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.960
One voice to the next.
For a thousand years.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.240
Pretty good record as it went.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.240
Direct line to the stars.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.440
No need to write it down.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.800
Is that why you paused on your shot?

32:38.640 --> 32:40.080
Didn't think you wanna talk about that.

32:40.160 --> 32:42.240
Killing him killed the story.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.240
No, he was dead already,

32:46.440 --> 32:48.120
whether I drew a bead on him or not.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.320
[Cornelia] Doesn't that bother you?

32:51.320 --> 32:53.040
Don’t see I got a say in it.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.360
Ain't that the point?

32:55.360 --> 32:56.440
I'll tell your story.

32:56.520 --> 32:58.000
-Yeah?
-[Cornelia] Yeah.

32:58.080 --> 33:00.040
Willingly.

33:01.720 --> 33:02.880
But you ain't survived it yet.

33:12.600 --> 33:13.880
We can't go to town.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.160
[Cornelia] Why?

33:17.120 --> 33:18.520
Same reason we're off the trail.

33:19.840 --> 33:21.640
Can't move forward.
Don't know what's ahead.

33:21.720 --> 33:22.800
Got no choice.

33:24.600 --> 33:25.920
We gotta go back.

33:27.560 --> 33:31.440
[dramatic music playing]

34:11.200 --> 34:14.200
Don't go telling anybody about your money.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.400
You don't trust them?

34:16.640 --> 34:18.880
You met anyone out here you could?

34:37.280 --> 34:38.360
Scout?

34:40.360 --> 34:41.480
Kickapoo.

34:43.760 --> 34:44.800
Cherokee.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.520
That why you stayed?

34:49.880 --> 34:50.880
Instead of what?

34:52.480 --> 34:54.320
I thought the Kickapoo went South?

34:54.400 --> 34:55.840
Mexico some place,

34:55.920 --> 34:57.880
instead of picking up on these allotments.

34:59.160 --> 35:03.600
Well, that was Ishko's people,
drunkards and fools. [laughs]

35:04.640 --> 35:05.920
[Eli] You got offered allotments?

35:06.000 --> 35:07.160
[John] Takin' em' up.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.400
Down there it's just rock and dust.

35:10.480 --> 35:11.880
[John] Oklahoma?

35:11.960 --> 35:13.160
Beautiful territory.

35:15.040 --> 35:16.880
Some is, some ain't.

35:16.960 --> 35:21.160
Well, takes time to make a bed
for Mother Corn.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.120
They're never gonna grow without water.

35:23.160 --> 35:25.800
We dug for ours
through 20-foot of rock till we hit it.

35:25.880 --> 35:27.160
And they let you keep it?

35:27.280 --> 35:28.760
They?

35:28.840 --> 35:31.120
[laughs] Oh, no.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.320
You know the greatest enemy to an Indian?

35:41.880 --> 35:43.040
Our past.

35:44.760 --> 35:46.840
We have to turn our back on it.

35:46.920 --> 35:49.400
If we've any hope to survive.

35:51.160 --> 35:52.560
I got a knack for survival.

35:52.640 --> 35:55.560
Well, then you will look to the future.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.760
[Eli] Lookin' to head back North.

35:58.840 --> 36:00.800
-Why there?
-Where I was born.

36:00.880 --> 36:03.800
Long as you remember,
it ain't who you are.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.000
Not anymore.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.280
[Katie] John, quit your lecturing.

36:08.360 --> 36:09.600
[John] I apologize.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.160
I'm awfully quick for sermonizing.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.880
[Katie] You are.

36:15.960 --> 36:17.400
He really is.

36:18.080 --> 36:20.000
[John] But with this Ghost Dance going on,

36:20.080 --> 36:21.840
I mean, that's pure insanity.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.520
Can't go dancing to a better future.

36:24.600 --> 36:25.960
You gotta dig for it.

36:27.120 --> 36:28.280
[Katie] John, please.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.800
I'll just talk to my doll here.

36:33.160 --> 36:36.160
So, I've got a mix we use for dogies.

36:36.200 --> 36:38.480
When the baby wakes it will nourish it
better than she's used to.

36:38.560 --> 36:39.560
Well, thank you.

36:39.680 --> 36:40.800
And I've been thinking, John,

36:40.880 --> 36:43.440
there's that family near Hungry Horse
lost a babe.

36:43.520 --> 36:45.280
I'm guessing her milk is still on.

36:45.360 --> 36:46.680
Yeah, we should ride out.

36:47.160 --> 36:49.840
[Katie] Not sure how they'd take
to a couple of extra mouths.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.040
Oh, I've got money, I can offer to pay.

37:00.760 --> 37:01.960
No.

37:02.040 --> 37:03.600
It's Christian folk.

37:04.400 --> 37:06.000
I'm sure God will find a way.

37:07.360 --> 37:10.160
And seeing as that rabbit fell
at your feet, no point in wasting it.

37:12.560 --> 37:13.800
Milche.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.160
[Katie] I thought you said
she didn't speak?

37:16.280 --> 37:18.640
German? Milche yah?

37:21.600 --> 37:23.160
Oh, you spooked her.

37:23.280 --> 37:24.280
[laughs]

37:24.360 --> 37:25.600
Now ain't that something?

37:25.640 --> 37:27.160
Do you-- do you speak German?

37:27.200 --> 37:28.280
Yup.

37:28.360 --> 37:30.600

37:31.560 --> 37:34.560
What did--
what did her folk look like?

37:34.640 --> 37:36.440
Well-- Well, it was, um...

37:36.520 --> 37:38.440
-There a father?
-Yes.

37:38.520 --> 37:41.880
He have, like,
a pre-war beard, no mustache?

37:41.960 --> 37:42.960
Yup.

37:44.680 --> 37:45.680
Sunday suit?

37:45.800 --> 37:46.800
Some.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.160
Mennonites.

37:48.760 --> 37:51.960
Come through here not five days ago
saying there was a wagon down, remember?

37:52.040 --> 37:53.200
-[John] Uh-hmm.
-[Katie] There was a family

37:53.320 --> 37:54.920
with a pregnancy got held up.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.840
Asked us to keep an eye out for him
should they pass.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.160
[John] Yeah.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.440
And here they are.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.480
What's left of 'em.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.160
Where-- Where were they going?

38:07.760 --> 38:09.040
Oklahoma.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.320
Sorry. Which way-- which way is that?

38:11.840 --> 38:13.040
South.

38:13.120 --> 38:15.840
They're boomers,
heading for another land run.

38:15.920 --> 38:16.920
South.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.120
Um, so might you ride after them?

38:21.640 --> 38:22.640
Us?

38:22.800 --> 38:24.560
It's just that we're headed North.

38:27.280 --> 38:30.320
Well, there, back, around ten days.

38:30.400 --> 38:31.840
And farm work can't wait.

38:34.640 --> 38:35.640
Couldn't you?

38:37.800 --> 38:41.440
We, um, we have reasons,
you know, not to...

38:41.920 --> 38:43.200
Go backwards.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.520
But we will.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.040
I mean, of course we will.

38:57.640 --> 38:58.640
We must.

39:27.160 --> 39:28.800
They've offered us supplies

39:29.560 --> 39:31.360
and a draft horse if we want.

39:33.280 --> 39:34.480
[Eli] Not me.

39:35.080 --> 39:36.160
Why?

39:37.200 --> 39:38.840
[Eli] Turned around far enough.

39:38.920 --> 39:40.320
Need to turn back.

39:45.280 --> 39:46.600
You heard of boomers?

39:48.200 --> 39:49.200
No.

39:50.160 --> 39:53.040
First, the government sent us down
to Indian Territory,

39:53.400 --> 39:55.360
now they just don't call it Oklahoma.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.600
First it was ours.

39:59.160 --> 40:00.200
Now, it's not.

40:01.920 --> 40:04.200
Put us on little strips
of hard rock scrabble

40:04.320 --> 40:07.320
and opened up the rest to land runs
for everyone else.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.600
For White folk.

40:12.920 --> 40:14.320
That's boomers.

40:16.320 --> 40:19.440
White folk could come like locusts
hopping over each other's back

40:19.520 --> 40:21.760
to steal the land
we'd only just been given.

40:22.640 --> 40:25.120
Even though the best bites,
we never even got a sniff.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.880
See why we don't talk much no more?

40:34.520 --> 40:38.120
The English writes a Bible,
but didn't tell us no truths.

40:38.800 --> 40:41.920
The other day you said
you weren't looking for blame or favors.

40:42.000 --> 40:42.960
And I ain't.

40:43.680 --> 40:46.120
Just not where my future lies
like he said.

40:46.160 --> 40:48.120
Well, or mine, but...

40:50.080 --> 40:51.320
what other choice is there?

40:52.040 --> 40:55.160
Leave them local, be on our way.

40:55.480 --> 40:58.560
They are three days
from their family, Eli.

41:03.800 --> 41:05.280
Took mine through here once.

41:08.200 --> 41:12.840
Fifteen years back... been strong
armed down from Nebraska,

41:13.920 --> 41:15.640
heading where them folk are now.

41:19.160 --> 41:21.360
Wife died with child on the way.

41:24.760 --> 41:27.640
Can't be more than a hundred miles off
'fore I cut that one out.

41:31.200 --> 41:34.080
Kept the baby, girl,

41:34.560 --> 41:39.640
two years... till fever took her
like it took most everyone else.

41:45.800 --> 41:47.760
By the time the army
came back to fetch me,

41:47.840 --> 41:51.160
I was living for nothing,
but the blanket covered my head.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.600
I get what you gotta do
and why you gotta do it.

42:00.520 --> 42:02.560
And I ain't gonna make
no dance about it.

42:04.960 --> 42:06.600
But I've been here before.

42:08.160 --> 42:09.600
And I ain't going back.

42:11.920 --> 42:14.320
I gotta listen to myself on that one.
