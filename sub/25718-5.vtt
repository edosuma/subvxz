WEBVTT

00:48.590 --> 00:51.384
I know that it won't be easy. I'm sorry.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.512
But do it for me, please.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.850
She's Kyung-seok's mom?

00:59.309 --> 01:00.560
Yes.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.855
I guess
good looks are genetically inherited.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.276
Are his parents divorced, then?

01:10.195 --> 01:13.531
Why doesn't he want to see his mom though?

01:14.783 --> 01:16.034
I don't know.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.497
So what are you going to do?

01:22.665 --> 01:25.126
BASED ON THE WEBCOMINC
<i>MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY</i> BY KI MAENG-GI

01:25.376 --> 01:26.836
I'd do it if I were you.

01:27.295 --> 01:30.173
She saved your life,
so what's there you can't do for her?

01:31.549 --> 01:33.093
Don't say that.

01:35.303 --> 01:37.430
It's hard for me to say no to her.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.558
So don't say such a thing.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.020
It's none of my business.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.070
Who's there?

01:57.075 --> 01:58.284
Hey!

02:06.126 --> 02:08.211
Hello? Someone's been following us.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.155
POLICE

02:35.321 --> 02:36.239
Stop there.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.700
Stop right there!

02:39.492 --> 02:40.743
Stop!

02:59.888 --> 03:02.849
You're one fearless lady.
Why did you go after him?

03:02.932 --> 03:05.059
What if he was a bad guy?

03:05.143 --> 03:09.480
Someone has been following me lately,
but I couldn't find anybody.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.735
That wasn't me.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.112
I saw her for the first time today.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.157
I thought she was a celebrity,
so I just wanted to check.

03:20.408 --> 03:21.743
Then why did you run away?

03:22.285 --> 03:24.120
She started chasing me, so I got scared.

03:25.371 --> 03:27.957
He's cowardly.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.294
He'd never harm anyone.

03:31.377 --> 03:35.590
Anyway, he followed her at this late hour
and gave her the wrong impression.

03:35.673 --> 03:37.926
She must've been so scared.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.552
You punk, aren't I right?

03:41.512 --> 03:42.722
I apologize.

03:44.098 --> 03:45.683
I'm sorry.

03:47.393 --> 03:50.855
All right. It's okay, so don't cry.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.858
Who is it? What kind of jerk did it?

03:54.859 --> 03:57.111
How can I help you, sir?

03:57.654 --> 03:58.905
Dad.

04:00.615 --> 04:01.532
He's your dad?

04:06.371 --> 04:07.872
POLICE

04:07.956 --> 04:10.416
-Take care.
-Don't do that ever again.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.418
-I'm sorry.
-I apologize.

04:13.294 --> 04:15.964
-Goodbye.
-I'm sorry again.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.847
Yes, my dad is here.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.267
Yes, don't worry.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.060
Okay.

04:32.647 --> 04:37.568
Sir, are you saying you're the one
who has been tailing her?

04:41.155 --> 04:44.575
I just wanted to make sure
she gets home safely at night.

04:46.202 --> 04:49.998
Is he really your father?

04:50.248 --> 04:52.583
-Yes.
-Sir, I need your ID, please.

04:52.667 --> 04:56.254
I must confirm that you are
her guardian. Bring it over here now.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.351
Have you had dinner yet?

05:11.519 --> 05:13.646
Of course. It's late.

05:14.689 --> 05:15.606
Huh?

05:16.065 --> 05:18.484
Mr. Kang Tae-sik,
you've been reported missing.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.528
-Pardon?
-What?

05:22.322 --> 05:23.573
Well, this is...

05:23.656 --> 05:25.033
NAME OF MISSING PERSON

05:26.909 --> 05:32.874
The report... was filed by someone named
Na Eun-shim. Looks like she's your wife.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.668
-Dad.
-Goodness.

05:37.754 --> 05:41.174
Don't you dare run away again.
If you do, I'll really divorce you.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.066
Why did you run away from home?

06:00.777 --> 06:03.112
Mom said you were doing fine.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.074
I am doing fine.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.369
Go in.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.622
You should come in.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.416
No, it's okay. It's getting late,
so you should go in.

06:20.421 --> 06:21.506
Mr. Kang!

06:22.799 --> 06:25.259
-Long time no see, Hyun-jung.
-You should come up.

06:25.802 --> 06:26.761
It's okay. Next time.

06:26.844 --> 06:29.263
Come on, you're here
and can't leave like this.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.474
Please come in for a cup of tea.
Let's go.

06:50.535 --> 06:53.037
Hey, you go and have a seat.

06:56.666 --> 06:57.500
Go.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.350
You keep your place clean and neat.

07:16.227 --> 07:18.938
You will go home, right?

07:21.107 --> 07:22.442
All right.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.611
-It's still hot.
-Oh, okay.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.238
Thanks.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.325
It's hot!

07:31.868 --> 07:33.703
-Oh, no.
-Gosh.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.247
She told you that it's still hot.

07:36.330 --> 07:37.748
Mr. Kang, are you okay?

07:38.583 --> 07:39.917
I'm... I'm okay.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.462
-I'm fine.
-You don't seem okay.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.351
I should get going.

07:58.769 --> 07:59.604
Already?

08:03.107 --> 08:04.150
Mom.

08:04.233 --> 08:07.445
-What are you doing here?
-My goodness.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.614
Let's go. Come on.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.908
You made me worry so much.
What happened?

08:11.991 --> 08:13.159
Let's talk later.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.122
-You should follow them.
-Okay.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.332
Go on.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.838
Call me when you get home.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.423
Okay, go back inside.

08:29.759 --> 08:33.596
I came all the way, but you won't let me
have some time with my own daughter.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.847
Were you curious about Mi-rae?

08:35.932 --> 08:38.893
Then you should've come home.
What kind of nonsense is this?

08:39.268 --> 08:42.188
What was the money about?
Are we getting a divorce?

08:42.270 --> 08:43.813
Why would I give you alimony?

08:45.316 --> 08:46.776
It was for the surgery expenses.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.322
Where did you get 5 million won?

08:51.656 --> 08:54.992
You have a separate savings account
that I don't know of? Honey!

09:14.887 --> 09:16.097
KANG MI-RAE

09:16.180 --> 09:18.391
<i>Can we meet tomorrow?</i>

09:26.482 --> 09:27.900
Hasn't she called yet?

09:35.825 --> 09:37.285
Let's not talk about it.

09:47.670 --> 09:52.633
GENES OF HANKOOK

09:52.717 --> 09:55.469
GENES OF HANKOOK

09:55.553 --> 09:56.762
I hope Twice comes.

09:57.471 --> 09:59.432
Twice.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.144
Sua.

10:04.478 --> 10:05.896
Hello.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.482
You and Kyung-seok need to serve the bar.

10:08.566 --> 10:09.650
Pardon?

10:09.942 --> 10:12.028
-We'll do it too.
-That's right.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.655
-We might not need your help.
-Right.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.328
Why do I need to?

10:22.371 --> 10:24.248
Because you are the face of the campus.

10:24.332 --> 10:28.169
I volunteered to help her out.
Why would she hold me back?

10:30.254 --> 10:32.673
Can you stop hitting on Sua?

10:32.757 --> 10:35.426
If you want to become like Kyung-seok,
do it right.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.599
Did you do well on your test?

10:44.185 --> 10:45.436
Yes.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.612
Would you like to have a drink?

11:21.722 --> 11:22.682
What's wrong?

11:28.020 --> 11:29.063
I'm sorry.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.941
For what?

11:32.024 --> 11:33.734
It wasn't your fault...

11:34.276 --> 11:36.404
that you met her,
but I took it out on you.

11:43.661 --> 11:44.829
Weren't you mad?

11:46.122 --> 11:48.040
I have quite a big heart.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.081
What are you doing?

12:33.961 --> 12:35.838
Please don't get angry.

12:40.634 --> 12:43.637
Do you really not want to talk
to your mom?

12:57.067 --> 12:59.278
Is that why you asked me
to drink with you?

13:01.655 --> 13:03.657
When you said that you have a big heart,

13:05.701 --> 13:07.661
you meant that you're nosy.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.424
This can't compare
to what you've been through,

13:22.635 --> 13:25.346
but I wasn't able to see my dad
for a long time.

13:26.722 --> 13:29.266
My dad didn't want me
to get plastic surgery.

13:29.767 --> 13:33.437
So I lied that I was going abroad
for language studies and got surgery.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.862
And I met him
on the day of our entrance ceremony.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.199
Dad.

13:46.909 --> 13:47.910
I'm sorry.

13:48.702 --> 13:50.412
I don't know you.

13:52.873 --> 13:55.251
<i>But he got angry and just left.</i>

14:08.305 --> 14:10.933
<i>Family members end up hating</i>
<i>each other...</i>

14:12.059 --> 14:14.436
<i>because they get hurt by one another.</i>

14:18.232 --> 14:19.441
<i>Where's Dad?</i>

14:19.817 --> 14:21.277
Well,

14:21.735 --> 14:23.821
just because I miss you two.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.582
<i>Hello?</i>

14:34.999 --> 14:36.250
<i>What's wrong?</i>

14:36.542 --> 14:39.420
No, it's nothing.

14:42.631 --> 14:45.634
Okay, I'll call you again.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.344
Bye.

14:56.937 --> 14:59.356
He must've suffered a lot until now.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.694
Way more than I did.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.041
You've grown up so much.

15:27.885 --> 15:30.054
How do I look?

15:32.014 --> 15:35.267
I was going to doll myself up
once Mi-rae became pretty,

15:35.351 --> 15:37.019
but I just didn't have the money.

15:38.395 --> 15:42.316
I can't believe
you kept that much money all to yourself.

15:42.983 --> 15:45.945
Look at me.
Do I look weird? Huh?

15:46.654 --> 15:49.073
What about this one?

15:49.823 --> 15:51.200
You don't like this either?

15:51.283 --> 15:53.827
I reconciled with Mi-rae, not you.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.913
That's seriously enough.

15:55.996 --> 15:58.582
Would you have let her do it
if I told you beforehand?

15:59.124 --> 16:01.460
I'd still let her get surgery
no matter what.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.381
Look.

16:05.547 --> 16:08.634
Look at how cheerful she is.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.679
See? Look.

16:17.768 --> 16:22.231
She told me that everyone likes her
and that she's having so much fun.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.942
And that made me tear up.

16:28.487 --> 16:32.491
Everyone ends up liking Mi-rae.
Who wouldn't?

16:49.675 --> 16:51.093
So are you satisfied?

16:52.011 --> 16:54.513
-What?
-You lied to get plastic surgery.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.811
Well, not exactly.

17:01.729 --> 17:02.646
Why?

17:03.772 --> 17:06.066
Because it's so obvious
that I got plastic surgery.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.992
You also laughed at me.

17:16.827 --> 17:17.869
I did?

17:19.704 --> 17:20.580
When?

17:21.540 --> 17:24.877
-Forget it if you don't remember.
-No, tell me.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.005
You can't go until you tell me.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.175
Tell me.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.343
When did I laugh at you?

17:37.181 --> 17:38.390
Back when...

17:39.850 --> 17:41.685
we were at the bus stop.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.620
You laughed at me.

18:03.207 --> 18:06.085
You probably don't even remember it
but I was so--

18:06.168 --> 18:07.169
I remember.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.256
I remember that day vividly,

18:13.759 --> 18:15.135
but I never laughed at you.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.807
I was looking at your feet, not your face.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.610
Your feet made me laugh.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.780
I had never seen anyone dance like that.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.742
That's why I asked you at the orientation.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.036
I could tell it was you.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.207
In my middle school life,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.169
I think I smiled only once.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.301
It was because of you.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.031
Mi-rae, can't you walk straight?

19:22.452 --> 19:23.787
I'm walking straight.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.832
You shouldn't drink
if you don't know your limit.

19:26.915 --> 19:30.544
I have to drink to find out.
How will I know if I never drink?

19:54.693 --> 19:55.861
There was a car coming.

19:58.864 --> 19:59.823
Right.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.327
Thanks.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.764
Are you all right?

20:24.473 --> 20:25.682
Yes.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.059
By the way...

20:30.520 --> 20:31.897
can I see that again?

20:36.777 --> 20:37.653
This.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.744
I forgot how to do it.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.329
Wasn't this it?

20:58.882 --> 21:00.592
But the thing is...

21:01.176 --> 21:03.428
You never laughed at me.
I got that, but...

21:04.263 --> 21:06.431
why did you say something
about my perfume?

21:08.350 --> 21:09.935
When we were cleaning together.

21:11.728 --> 21:15.607
You asked if I was wearing perfume.
You wanted to pick on me, right?

21:17.192 --> 21:18.277
That perfume...

21:21.446 --> 21:23.282
It's the scent that I hate the most.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.035
<i>That woman's perfume.</i>

21:29.413 --> 21:30.330
Hey.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.375
Are you wearing perfume?

21:35.377 --> 21:39.381
<i>She always looked in the mirror...</i>
<i>and sprayed that perfume all over her.</i>

21:44.553 --> 21:46.513
<i>Like a crazy person.</i>

21:58.650 --> 21:59.943
<i>Then one day,</i>

22:00.986 --> 22:02.904
she abandoned her children and left.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.427
I wasn't trying to pick on you.

22:38.982 --> 22:40.442
But the thing is,

22:41.777 --> 22:43.111
back then...

22:50.285 --> 22:51.370
Shall I take you home?

22:52.496 --> 22:53.705
No, it's fine.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.251
Well, then I'm...

22:58.794 --> 23:00.337
See you. Bye.

23:37.249 --> 23:40.127
You're Kelun's very first Korean model.

23:40.210 --> 23:44.089
We're honored
to work with the best actress.

23:44.548 --> 23:45.632
The honor is mine.

23:45.715 --> 23:48.552
And I really enjoyed the dinner as well.
Thank you.

23:49.010 --> 23:50.095
I'm glad to hear that.

23:50.178 --> 23:53.014
To tell you the truth,
my taste buds are quite dull.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.475
Really? Why?

23:56.893 --> 24:00.564
I guess I'm getting old.
Many things aren't how they used to be.

24:02.858 --> 24:07.279
Can I ask how old you are,
if you don't mind?

24:07.737 --> 24:09.531
-I'm 47.
-My gosh.

24:10.532 --> 24:11.950
You don't look it!

24:12.451 --> 24:15.787
Don't say that. Now that you know,
you'll think I look my age.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.207
Which skincare clinic do you go to?

24:20.459 --> 24:22.961
I don't go to any.

24:32.262 --> 24:33.972
Find out which clinic she goes to.

24:34.055 --> 24:36.183
-I'm going to go there from now on.
-Okay.

24:39.186 --> 24:41.730
SOO-HYUN (3), PROF. PARK (2)
MS. KIM MIN-JI (4)

24:45.233 --> 24:46.985
KANG MI-RAE

24:49.029 --> 24:50.238
Hi, Mi-rae.

24:51.448 --> 24:54.910
I'm sorry.
I tried to talk to him about it, but...

24:56.286 --> 24:59.331
No, it's okay.
I asked you, knowing how hard it'd be.

24:59.456 --> 25:00.790
I'm sorry.

25:01.082 --> 25:03.293
Don't worry. Please just forget about it.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.255
<i>But we should meet up anyway.</i>

25:07.339 --> 25:08.882
You can visit me at my office.

25:09.966 --> 25:12.177
-All right.
-Okay.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.804
Good night.

25:36.826 --> 25:38.453
<i>Mi-rae, can't you walk straight?</i>

25:42.207 --> 25:43.500
I'm walking straight.

25:45.126 --> 25:47.546
You shouldn't drink
if you don't know your limit.

25:48.046 --> 25:50.298
I have to drink to find out.

26:07.649 --> 26:11.903
TO: NA HYE-SUNG

26:13.655 --> 26:15.240
Hey, Mi-rae!

26:16.825 --> 26:18.451
I have big news.

26:18.535 --> 26:19.953
The rapper wants to see me.

26:20.537 --> 26:21.496
-Seriously?
-Yes.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.583
I sent him my lyrics
and he asked me to visit his studio.

26:24.666 --> 26:28.128
What should I do?
I haven't had any time to practice.

26:29.170 --> 26:30.505
Oh Hyun-jung!

26:31.715 --> 26:33.300
Hey, are you mocking me now?

26:33.383 --> 26:34.342
Of course not.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.803
Gosh, I have to practice more.

26:37.053 --> 26:38.471
<i>I never laughed at you.</i>

26:39.306 --> 26:41.641
<i>I was looking at your feet, not your face.</i>

26:43.685 --> 26:45.145
Your feet made me laugh.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.440
I had never seen anyone dance like that.

26:50.567 --> 26:52.152
<i>I wasn't trying to pick on you.</i>

27:02.287 --> 27:04.539
<i>I misjudged Kyung-seok.</i>

27:19.054 --> 27:20.347
Are you all right?

27:20.930 --> 27:21.973
Hey.

27:22.557 --> 27:23.475
Hey.

27:29.230 --> 27:30.482
You crazy jerk.

27:32.108 --> 27:36.196
<i>Kyung-seok has never been...</i>

27:37.364 --> 27:38.615
<i>mean to me.</i>

27:53.755 --> 27:55.048
I must be crazy.

27:56.925 --> 28:01.137
<i>I smiled only once</i>
<i>in my middle school life.</i>

28:02.889 --> 28:04.265
It was because of you.

28:16.695 --> 28:21.908
A festival is all about crowded bars.
Why won't they let us sell alcohol?

28:21.991 --> 28:24.035
It is just a notice.
Can't we just sell it anyway?

28:24.119 --> 28:28.039
No, they even told us
to buy food from nearby markets,

28:28.123 --> 28:30.041
to not violate the Food Sanitation Act.

28:30.417 --> 28:31.668
Hello.

28:31.751 --> 28:34.963
-Then how are we going to make money?
-I know.

28:35.839 --> 28:38.633
We need to make enough
for the second semester.

28:41.386 --> 28:43.513
We'll just have to do a lot of PR.

28:43.638 --> 28:44.848
Okay.

28:45.181 --> 28:49.144
I heard there's a beauty among
the freshmen. I think it was Hyun Sua?

28:49.227 --> 28:51.896
Yes, Sua. She's one of a kind.

28:52.981 --> 28:55.066
There's this good-looking guy,
Kyung-seok.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.151
-Kyung-seok?
-Yes.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.362
-I don't think he'll do it.
-Why not?

28:59.446 --> 29:01.740
He won't listen to his seniors?

29:01.823 --> 29:05.535
He's the guy who beat Chan-woo up.

29:05.618 --> 29:08.496
Oh, that's him? My gosh.

29:09.164 --> 29:10.331
I love him already.

29:14.002 --> 29:18.047
Then, Sua and Kyung-seok to serve tables.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.258
Who else can we choose?

29:20.884 --> 29:22.260
Ji-hyo?

29:23.511 --> 29:24.971
A couple of more people.

29:25.054 --> 29:27.849
Eun, you should notify them
and bring them later.

29:28.349 --> 29:29.184
Okay.

29:29.559 --> 29:30.935
How about Mi-rae?

29:31.019 --> 29:33.396
Oh, her!

29:33.480 --> 29:35.648
-She's beautiful.
-Gosh, of course.

29:36.441 --> 29:37.734
She's very pretty.

29:38.067 --> 29:41.070
Then add Mi-rae to the list. Okay.

29:41.529 --> 29:42.614
Nice.

30:01.257 --> 30:04.260
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>
<i>He's not even that attractive.</i>

30:07.055 --> 30:09.766
<i>All that's changed</i>
<i>is that he wasn't such a jerk after all.</i>

30:11.226 --> 30:13.561
<i>That's all. But why...</i>

30:23.947 --> 30:25.990
-Excuse me.
-Watch out.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.923
Did you get home safely?

30:42.006 --> 30:44.050
Yes, of course.

30:44.884 --> 30:46.052
Did you sleep well?

30:46.135 --> 30:48.721
<i>I must be crazy. Why would I ask him that?</i>

30:49.639 --> 30:51.641
-What are you doing for the festival?
-The festival?

30:51.724 --> 30:52.767
Are you coming?

30:52.851 --> 30:56.396
I'm not sure.
I'm a little busy these days.

30:56.855 --> 30:57.814
You're busy?

30:57.897 --> 31:00.692
Yes, everyone's busy.
I'm sure you're busy as well.

31:01.484 --> 31:02.527
I'm not busy.

31:03.653 --> 31:04.863
I see.

31:06.114 --> 31:09.033
Lucky you. I'll be off now.

31:13.955 --> 31:14.789
Kyung-seok.

31:16.624 --> 31:18.835
Would you like to serve the bar
at the festival?

31:18.918 --> 31:21.462
-No.
-Okay.

31:25.341 --> 31:27.760
I wanted to see if you'd like
to serve the bar at the festival.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.722
Min-ah told me about that.

31:30.847 --> 31:32.807
I have no choice but to help out.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.101
I heard it's mandatory
for pretty girls.

31:35.184 --> 31:38.062
The seniors asked if you could do it.
Are you interested?

31:38.146 --> 31:39.314
What?

31:40.857 --> 31:42.358
Is the festival this week?

31:42.442 --> 31:43.693
Isn't it next week?

31:43.902 --> 31:44.903
Oh, is it next week?

31:46.154 --> 31:47.697
Okay, I'll do it.

31:48.865 --> 31:49.824
What about Mi-rae?

31:49.908 --> 31:51.409
I need to ask her.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.329
I see.
She must be in it as well.

32:02.170 --> 32:05.965
I was planning to sell scented candles
at the festival.

32:07.383 --> 32:10.011
Can you do that after you serve tables?

32:10.595 --> 32:13.806
Can't you just put out an announcement
and gather volunteers?

32:14.515 --> 32:15.475
Well...

32:15.934 --> 32:19.145
The seniors picked the candidates.

32:19.812 --> 32:21.064
It's driving me crazy.

32:24.442 --> 32:25.818
And they want me to do it?

32:25.902 --> 32:28.988
Yes, they picked you, Sua, and Ji-hyo.

32:29.572 --> 32:32.200
Gosh, why can't we just get volunteers?

32:34.911 --> 32:36.162
Hey, I'll do it.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.708
What? How long were you in there?

32:41.334 --> 32:43.878
About 10 minutes?
I have constipation lately.

32:51.511 --> 32:54.472
They just want the pretty ones
and I can't because I'm not pretty.

32:57.725 --> 32:59.310
Hey, you guys.

32:59.394 --> 33:00.895
Hey.

33:03.690 --> 33:06.859
Did Eun ask you
to serve at the festival yet?

33:09.487 --> 33:13.074
Yes, I told her that I'll think about it.
But--

33:13.157 --> 33:15.034
Let's do it. I'll be doing it.

33:15.118 --> 33:17.453
If you refuse, it'll only burden Eun.

33:18.621 --> 33:19.580
Right.

33:20.289 --> 33:21.457
I guess I should do it.

33:21.541 --> 33:24.043
Yes. I think it'll be fun.

33:34.053 --> 33:35.763
About you and Kyung-seok...

33:36.264 --> 33:37.098
Yes?

33:37.181 --> 33:41.352
I thought you didn't know each other
at first because you acted like that.

33:41.811 --> 33:43.021
Well...

33:43.896 --> 33:45.523
We weren't that close.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.776
-Really?
-Yes.

33:52.030 --> 33:52.989
Look at this.

33:53.072 --> 33:54.782
My gosh, she's pretty.

33:56.617 --> 33:57.827
I know her.

33:57.910 --> 33:59.495
How do you know her?

33:59.579 --> 34:03.124
I don't know her in person. She's
the goddess of Hankook University.

34:03.207 --> 34:04.333
What?

34:06.335 --> 34:08.337
She really is pretty.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.799
Why would someone
like her like your photo?

34:12.467 --> 34:15.844
Because she liked the photo I uploaded,
you punk.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.014
I'm going to capture this.

34:18.598 --> 34:21.516
-The goddess...
-I think she liked it by mistake.

34:21.601 --> 34:22.851
No, she didn't.

34:23.603 --> 34:24.687
Stop it.

34:24.771 --> 34:26.063
-Hello.
-Hello.

34:26.147 --> 34:27.648
-Having a meeting?
-Yes.

34:27.732 --> 34:29.525
You need to bring a lot of friends.

34:29.900 --> 34:33.154
I'm not sure if I'll have time.
I need to go room searching.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.197
Are you moving?

34:34.280 --> 34:36.991
Yes, the landlord wants
to raise the deposit and rent.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.243
-Really? That's absurd.
-Yes.

34:39.409 --> 34:41.370
-Did you plan some stuff?
-No, not yet.

34:41.454 --> 34:43.581
-Hello.
-Hey, you guys.

34:43.664 --> 34:44.998
-Hello.
-Hi.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.126
-Keep up the good work.
-Okay.

34:47.210 --> 34:48.043
-Bye.
-Bye.

34:48.127 --> 34:49.378
-See you.
-Bye.

34:50.004 --> 34:53.216
Gosh, the room brightened up
as soon as you guys came in.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.342
-Thank you.
-My gosh.

34:55.426 --> 34:56.928
Mi-rae, Sua, and Ji-hyo.

34:57.011 --> 34:59.222
-You met Eun before, right?
-Yes.

34:59.305 --> 35:01.599
-Hi, you guys.
-Hello.

35:01.682 --> 35:03.976
-You guys should sit down.
-Okay.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.770
-Take a seat.
-Sit down.

35:06.062 --> 35:07.855
<i>She looks so cute.</i>

35:08.481 --> 35:11.025
<i>Her eyes are round and big.</i>
<i>And her face...</i>

35:14.153 --> 35:16.364
How could you come later
than the waitresses?

35:16.447 --> 35:18.449
Go easy.
She cut class to come here.

35:18.533 --> 35:19.617
My gosh.

35:19.700 --> 35:23.246
Some of you don't know each other,
so let's all introduce ourselves.

35:23.371 --> 35:24.997
-You go first.
-Okay.

35:25.581 --> 35:28.251
Hi, I'm Jo Jung-yeob,
the rep of the junior year.

35:28.668 --> 35:29.961
-Hello.
-Hello.

35:30.044 --> 35:31.671
You already know me.
I'm Ko Ye-na.

35:31.754 --> 35:34.715
-I'm Kwon Yoon-byeol, the sophomore rep.
-She was a girl?

35:37.885 --> 35:40.263
You guys all thought she was a guy, right?

35:40.346 --> 35:43.641
Everyone who sees you
for the first time thinks of you as a guy.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.059
Next.

35:46.477 --> 35:47.520
Come on, go ahead.

35:47.603 --> 35:50.606
-Are you going to make fun of me again?
-No. Go on.

35:51.315 --> 35:55.903
I'm a sophomore,
and my name is Kim Tae-hee.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.280
She's Fat Tae-hee.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.490
Hey.

36:00.741 --> 36:03.244
Why would you change her name like that?

36:03.327 --> 36:05.705
-She looks just like Kim Tae-hee.
-<i>She's pretty.</i>

36:07.290 --> 36:11.169
You must feel great as you got picked
as the prettiest girls in first year.

36:11.919 --> 36:13.171
-Sorry?
-Come on.

36:13.254 --> 36:15.756
Don't act like you don't know.
You're number one.

36:16.424 --> 36:19.427
Number one?
But we don't have our grades yet.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.679
We're talking about face, not grades.

36:22.638 --> 36:25.766
Sua, I think you're putting on an act
when you know everything.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.769
No, not at all.
And I'm certainly not number one.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.356
What about Kyung-seok?
He said no?

36:32.982 --> 36:35.359
-No.
-You should've persuaded him.

36:35.860 --> 36:36.986
He said no right away.

36:37.069 --> 36:38.696
-Shall I try to lure him?
-Sorry?

36:38.779 --> 36:40.489
Forget it. I'd be nice to have him

36:40.573 --> 36:43.951
but we usually have girls serve at the bar
so it's okay.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.036
You're right.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.287
But why?

36:47.955 --> 36:50.499
What do you mean?
It's just our tradition.

36:51.626 --> 36:54.128
I like how you put it.
"It's just our tradition."

36:54.212 --> 36:55.296
-Write it down.
-Okay.

36:55.379 --> 36:57.340
I should write it down. "Tradition."

36:57.423 --> 36:59.091
-"Tradition."
-What are you doing?

37:01.469 --> 37:05.640
HYUNMOO REAL ESTATE OFFICE

37:05.806 --> 37:09.268
Many Hankook University students
live in this neighborhood

37:09.352 --> 37:11.229
-because it's close to school.
-I see.

37:20.029 --> 37:22.448
The owner put up new wallpaper.

37:22.573 --> 37:24.992
-It's clean, isn't it?
-Did he do it himself?

37:25.117 --> 37:28.079
It's a bit damp
because he put it directly on the wall.

37:30.998 --> 37:32.625
It feels fine to me.

37:32.708 --> 37:34.543
Is your palm sweaty?

37:38.881 --> 37:41.259
You don't even need
to test the water pressure.

37:41.342 --> 37:42.635
It's perfect.

37:46.847 --> 37:49.433
If you want to take this place,
you should hurry.

37:49.642 --> 37:52.103
Another student will come by later.

37:52.186 --> 37:54.105
-I'll check out a few more.
-All right.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.358
It's you, right? Mi-rae's TA.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.193
Oh, hello!
You're Hyun-jung, right?

37:59.277 --> 38:01.862
-Oh, you remember my name.
-Of course.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.406
-Do you live here?
-Yes.

38:03.823 --> 38:06.826
-You live around here too?
-No, I'm checking out some places.

38:06.909 --> 38:08.536
Are you thinking of moving here?

38:09.245 --> 38:12.623
There's a newly built low-rise multiplex
down the street.

38:12.707 --> 38:14.583
There's a nice one in that building.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.752
-I'd love to see it.
-Then let's go.

38:16.836 --> 38:18.254
Oh, that building.

38:20.673 --> 38:23.301
I know this neighborhood
like the back of my hand.

38:23.426 --> 38:25.803
-Shall I go with you?
-Gosh, it's okay.

38:25.970 --> 38:29.557
It's totally fine with me.
I have nothing to do, and I'm free.

38:31.559 --> 38:34.729
This time,
we have to actively promote the event,

38:34.854 --> 38:37.356
so I'm thinking of changing
the uniform to a skirt.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.608
-No.
-You won't even have to wear it.

38:39.692 --> 38:41.068
Tae-hee won't, either.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.070
Why drag me into this?
I said nothing.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.406
You stand out
even if you don't say anything

38:45.489 --> 38:46.741
because you're so chubby.

38:49.952 --> 38:51.704
<i>That's not "chubby."</i>

38:52.705 --> 38:53.873
<i>Her weight is normal.</i>

38:53.956 --> 38:56.250
So all of you are against the skirt idea?

38:57.293 --> 38:58.961
I can wear whatever.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.088
Me too.

39:01.589 --> 39:04.091
-I don't care either.
-Are you going to do it too?

39:04.383 --> 39:07.136
Why would a wilted flower serve
when we have fresh ones?

39:07.219 --> 39:08.262
What did you say?

39:08.346 --> 39:09.597
She's not a wilted one.

39:10.139 --> 39:12.099
-Do you still have a crush on her?
-Do you?

39:12.725 --> 39:14.769
-My goodness.
-All right, enough.

39:14.852 --> 39:16.937
Jung-ho and Ye-na,
pick out a new uniform.

39:17.021 --> 39:20.024
Okay, can you girls tell me your sizes?
Sua, you first.

39:20.107 --> 39:22.610
Hey, I'll write the sizes down.
Sua.

39:23.277 --> 39:25.780
Small usually fits me well.

39:25.863 --> 39:27.698
-Small.
-Me too.

39:27.990 --> 39:29.909
-Extra small.
-No, just small.

39:29.992 --> 39:30.826
Extra small.

39:32.745 --> 39:34.330
I usually get large.

39:34.413 --> 39:36.791
Large? But you're slim.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.668
I'm quite tall, you know.

39:39.752 --> 39:42.880
Right, you're tall.
One large size.

39:43.005 --> 39:45.549
I must say,
we have a good selection of servers.

39:45.841 --> 39:47.593
They have contrasting charms.

39:48.969 --> 39:50.054
Contrasting charms?

39:50.137 --> 39:52.890
Sua is feminine while Mi-rae is sexy.

39:54.517 --> 39:55.601
What?

39:55.684 --> 39:58.187
I look immature
and short compared to her, right?

39:58.270 --> 40:00.940
Right, you're cute,
and you have a baby face.

40:03.109 --> 40:05.486
Let's wrap it up
if you're going to keep blabbering away.

40:10.991 --> 40:12.660
Now, we should talk about...

40:13.202 --> 40:16.789
For this price, you won't find
a better apartment than this.

40:17.123 --> 40:18.332
I see.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.876
There are security cameras
so it's safe too.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.507
This means the passcode got leaked.

40:31.720 --> 40:34.223
What do you say?
Shall I tell the landlord to meet?

40:34.306 --> 40:35.683
I'll see a few more places.

40:35.766 --> 40:39.061
Gosh. You, young man, are very picky.

40:40.354 --> 40:42.606
Hey, when will you be home?

40:45.443 --> 40:47.903
I see. All right.

40:49.572 --> 40:50.739
-Was that Mi-rae?
-Yes.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.867
She'll be late
because of the meeting.

40:52.950 --> 40:54.660
-Do you two live together?
-Yes.

40:55.578 --> 40:57.830
-Oh, here you go.
-Thank you.

40:57.955 --> 40:59.373
Please. I feel so bad.

40:59.457 --> 41:02.126
Gosh, please don't feel bad.
I volunteered.

41:02.209 --> 41:04.837
No, don't say that.
Thank you so much for your help.

41:05.754 --> 41:08.090
-Do you want to grab a beer later?
-Sorry?

41:08.174 --> 41:10.301
Somewhere near school.
Mi-rae can join us.

41:11.802 --> 41:14.054
-Sure.
-Shall we go, then?

41:21.896 --> 41:23.772
What? A wilted flower?

41:23.856 --> 41:26.025
What's wrong with my style?
That was crazy.

41:26.650 --> 41:29.487
Had I not been a freshman,
I would've caused a big scene.

41:31.197 --> 41:33.699
We shouldn't do that
when we're in our senior year.

41:34.783 --> 41:37.536
I don't even like
the idea of wearing skirts.

41:37.995 --> 41:40.122
It'll be uncomfortable to work in a skirt.

41:40.206 --> 41:42.625
It'd be different
if all of us were against it,

41:42.708 --> 41:44.960
but Sua and Ji-hyo are okay with it,
you know.

41:51.842 --> 41:53.093
Yes.

41:54.470 --> 41:56.013
Are you there alone?

41:57.723 --> 42:00.100
Okay, all right.

42:01.727 --> 42:04.480
Jung-boon is having a beer,
and she wants me to come.

42:04.563 --> 42:05.814
You should come too.

42:08.025 --> 42:11.445
My roommate must be waiting for me
to have dinner together.

42:13.822 --> 42:15.115
Just a second.

42:20.996 --> 42:23.707
Hey. Yes, it's done.

42:26.377 --> 42:29.171
Who? Our TA?

42:33.926 --> 42:35.177
Okay.

42:52.528 --> 42:53.946
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

42:54.738 --> 42:55.656
Goodbye.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.117
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

43:20.222 --> 43:22.433
-Come here for a second.
-Why? What's up?

43:22.975 --> 43:25.853
Let go.
Gosh, it hurts.

43:26.979 --> 43:28.522
Hey, let go of my hand.

43:28.939 --> 43:30.816
It hurts so badly.

43:31.275 --> 43:33.193
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

43:35.654 --> 43:37.489
-You see...
-Jung-boon.

43:38.741 --> 43:43.912
I guess you got the wrong idea
because I've been so nice to you.

43:46.874 --> 43:48.125
I have no feelings for you.

43:49.001 --> 43:51.795
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

43:52.921 --> 43:54.882
That's not what I'm trying to tell you.

43:55.049 --> 43:56.300
Listen carefully, okay?

43:57.760 --> 44:00.387
That girl is a thief.

44:01.430 --> 44:02.681
What?

44:05.934 --> 44:08.395
I saw her stealing money.

44:09.563 --> 44:10.731
Don't come here again.

44:11.357 --> 44:14.485
I didn't want to get angry at you,
but this is way out of line.

44:14.568 --> 44:15.944
-Well...
-Forget it.

44:16.028 --> 44:18.113
I don't even want to see you again.

44:21.617 --> 44:23.994
I didn't pay for my beer.

44:24.078 --> 44:27.289
Don't worry.
I'll just think that someone stole it.

44:32.503 --> 44:33.837
Hey, Jung-boon.

44:34.046 --> 44:36.465
Yes, forget it. We're through!

44:39.301 --> 44:41.595
Was she going out
with the owner of Berlin?

44:41.679 --> 44:44.139
No. Hey, Jung-boon!

44:48.644 --> 44:49.478
Mi-rae.

44:54.650 --> 44:55.859
Hello.

44:57.152 --> 44:59.071
-Have you been waiting long?
-No.

45:07.830 --> 45:08.872
Have you had dinner?

45:10.499 --> 45:11.458
Yes.

45:11.542 --> 45:13.877
If you're getting hungry,
have some lobsters.

45:13.961 --> 45:16.046
I steamed them now, so they're very good.

45:16.130 --> 45:18.298
-You steamed lobsters this late?
-Yes.

45:18.382 --> 45:21.427
Kyung-hee asked me
to steam some right at 9:00 p.m.

45:22.010 --> 45:23.721
She took one and went upstairs.

45:40.195 --> 45:41.572
<i>Hi, you're back.</i>

45:41.655 --> 45:46.869
DO NOT ENTER/DO NOT KNOCK

45:48.036 --> 45:51.290
Lobster is my favorite nighttime snack
of the moment.

45:51.373 --> 45:54.543
I've been eating one every night.

45:55.210 --> 45:58.172
All right. I'll cut it up first.

45:58.255 --> 45:59.590
DOVELY TV

45:59.673 --> 46:00.591
IT'S GIGANTIC!

46:00.674 --> 46:01.717
WHAT A SKILL!

46:01.800 --> 46:04.511
Well, lobster is my staple,

46:05.012 --> 46:06.680
so this is a piece of cake.

46:07.264 --> 46:10.392
And to do this well,
you need technique, not strength.

46:12.603 --> 46:15.647
Here. Do you see how plump it is?

46:16.607 --> 46:18.901
I'll try eating this now.

46:25.199 --> 46:29.745
<i>Tell Kyung-seok and Kyung-hee</i>
<i>that their mom wants to see them.</i>

46:35.626 --> 46:37.002
Why are you standing there?

46:37.711 --> 46:39.588
Come in if you have something to say.

46:47.930 --> 46:49.640
Does she have to go to the States?

46:50.891 --> 46:52.100
Why are you asking that?

46:52.184 --> 46:54.311
It's not like she wants to go.

46:54.394 --> 46:55.771
She's being forced to go.

46:56.897 --> 46:58.816
I should've sent her off sooner.

46:59.107 --> 47:02.486
I postponed it so as not to cause a ruckus
before the election.

47:03.362 --> 47:06.698
I wouldn't send her if her grades were
high enough for good universities here.

47:06.907 --> 47:08.575
So it's not for her sake.

47:09.284 --> 47:10.911
It's to save your reputation.

47:12.704 --> 47:14.706
Because an American one sounds better.

47:16.333 --> 47:17.376
What did you say?

47:23.173 --> 47:25.259
You must feel bad to send her away.

47:25.342 --> 47:28.595
But it's best for her.
She'll at least learn English there.

47:34.059 --> 47:36.728
That woman came back to Korea.

47:38.313 --> 47:40.691
She might contact you,
despite what she's done.

47:42.568 --> 47:45.529
Despite having an affair with a young punk
and abandoning her children...

47:48.282 --> 47:50.868
I know you won't see her.

47:51.410 --> 47:52.703
But just in case.

48:15.267 --> 48:19.271
KANG MI-RAE

48:28.322 --> 48:30.157
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

48:33.535 --> 48:35.996
It's a rooftop house,
but it has an air conditioner.

48:36.079 --> 48:39.333
The heating system works well in winter.
I think it's a good deal.

48:40.334 --> 48:42.210
When are you moving then?

48:42.294 --> 48:44.463
I'll pack tomorrow
and move the day after.

48:44.546 --> 48:46.506
I'll get it done during the festival.

48:47.132 --> 48:51.053
If you invest a little more on the deposit
you'll have a lot of better options.

48:52.095 --> 48:53.972
-Well, my budget is limited.
-I see.

48:54.056 --> 48:56.516
I earn less as a TA
than my undergraduate times.

48:56.600 --> 48:59.937
-Do you pay for your living expenses?
-My tuition, too.

49:01.063 --> 49:02.940
-Awesome.
-Even your tuition, too?

49:03.440 --> 49:05.817
I luckily got scholarships a few times.

49:05.901 --> 49:07.527
I had so many part-time jobs.

49:08.403 --> 49:09.863
That's amazing.

49:09.947 --> 49:12.074
-Cool.
-It's really cool.

49:12.157 --> 49:14.493
Anyone would do it in my situation.

49:15.035 --> 49:17.704
-Let's clink.
-Cheers.

49:21.875 --> 49:24.795
I thought I needed to take a few breaks,
but I was lucky.

49:25.253 --> 49:29.549
I tutored a student and his grades jumped,
which helped me get more students.

49:29.633 --> 49:32.386
He didn't study,
but he was actually smart.

49:32.469 --> 49:36.640
It must've been your nice tutoring skills
that helped his grades go up.

49:36.723 --> 49:38.350
-No.
-You're right.

49:39.101 --> 49:40.852
-You want some more beer?
-Sure.

49:43.855 --> 49:45.190
It's okay.

49:45.273 --> 49:48.986
I thought it'd take several days,
but I saved a lot of time thanks to you.

49:50.404 --> 49:53.198
-Can we have three more glasses of beer?
-Sure.

49:53.615 --> 49:56.618
By the way,
please feel free to talk casually to us.

49:57.536 --> 49:58.537
What?

49:58.620 --> 50:02.040
I mean, it's awkward to hear you
talk to us so politely.

50:02.165 --> 50:03.542
We're your juniors, you know.

50:03.625 --> 50:06.378
Right, it'd be great
if you talk to us casually.

50:07.963 --> 50:09.256
Will that be comfortable?

50:09.339 --> 50:10.424
-Yes.
-Yes.

50:11.967 --> 50:13.802
Then...

50:14.052 --> 50:14.886
Okay, guys.

50:15.971 --> 50:18.932
That's way better. It felt so suffocating.

50:19.558 --> 50:20.934
In that spirit, let's clink.

50:21.018 --> 50:23.311
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

50:24.604 --> 50:25.981
Hi.

50:28.358 --> 50:30.777
I came to help you,
but you aren't busy at all.

50:30.861 --> 50:33.238
Don't joke around with my means of living.

50:33.321 --> 50:35.240
I'm not in the mood for your jokes.

50:39.953 --> 50:42.080
It's usually hard for me to talk casually.

50:42.164 --> 50:44.041
-There you go again.
-Oops, sorry.

50:44.124 --> 50:47.586
-Please don't be so polite to us.
-I won't, for certain.

50:47.669 --> 50:49.546
-Eat up, guys.
-Shall we?

50:49.629 --> 50:51.006
-Let's eat.
-Go ahead.

50:51.089 --> 50:53.717
-It looks delicious.
-It is good.

50:56.970 --> 50:57.929
What are you doing?

51:08.565 --> 51:10.400
Your order is two cups of Americano.

51:10.484 --> 51:12.527
Gosh, this is crazy.

51:12.736 --> 51:14.738
-She's prettier in person.
-Right?

51:14.821 --> 51:15.864
Hello.

51:15.947 --> 51:18.992
Can I have one vanilla latte
and caffe mocha each?

51:19.076 --> 51:20.827
You look intimidated.

51:20.911 --> 51:22.329
No way.

51:24.748 --> 51:26.083
Look at him.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.835
Are you ready to order?

51:31.797 --> 51:34.424
Should I help you with your order?

51:36.176 --> 51:37.636
Three Americanos, please.

51:37.719 --> 51:39.471
Three Americanos, right?

51:41.431 --> 51:42.849
You want them to be hot?

51:43.433 --> 51:44.351
Yes.

51:48.188 --> 51:49.189
Here.

51:49.648 --> 51:51.274
Thank you.

51:52.901 --> 51:53.985
Here you go.

51:54.986 --> 51:56.154
Thank you.

52:08.708 --> 52:10.001
Excuse me.

52:10.627 --> 52:13.004
-Yes?
-My name is Park Yong-cheol.

52:13.547 --> 52:15.590
You liked my photos on Instagram.

52:16.174 --> 52:17.551
Oh, hello.

52:18.677 --> 52:20.971
I was surprised
that you didn't recognize me.

52:21.054 --> 52:23.348
-She recognizes him.
-Sorry.

52:24.307 --> 52:25.976
She really is pretty, by the way.

52:27.936 --> 52:29.354
What are they talking about?

52:32.399 --> 52:33.650
What did you talk about?

52:33.733 --> 52:36.153
She apologized for not recognizing me.

52:36.319 --> 52:39.823
She'll leave work soon
and she wants to grab beer with me.

52:40.031 --> 52:40.907
What should I do?

52:41.908 --> 52:43.785
Hey, it must be a lie.

52:43.869 --> 52:45.287
Right?

52:52.586 --> 52:54.504
-Let me in.
-Me too.

52:55.881 --> 52:57.299
This is what I'm capable of.

52:59.384 --> 53:01.761
Did you transfer to another school
after a year?

53:01.887 --> 53:02.971
13 months.

53:03.054 --> 53:04.848
But everyone knew him.

53:05.223 --> 53:07.851
Are you aware that your nickname was
Rain Kyung-seok?

53:08.268 --> 53:09.269
What's that?

53:09.352 --> 53:11.688
All the boys copied
how you would walk in the rain.

53:11.771 --> 53:14.191
-Didn't you know?
-Why would they do that?

53:14.274 --> 53:17.152
-It was because I had no umbrella.
-Gosh, that's annoying.

53:17.235 --> 53:20.155
You want me to say that they did it
because you looked cool?

53:20.822 --> 53:21.990
It's nothing cool.

53:22.115 --> 53:24.659
So Kyung-seok was really popular.

53:24.743 --> 53:27.120
-Didn't you guys like him?
-No, I didn't.

53:27.245 --> 53:30.624
It simply felt like
I was seeing a handsome celebrity.

53:31.458 --> 53:32.417
Pushing your limit?

53:35.170 --> 53:36.004
What?

53:39.090 --> 53:40.884
Well... yes...

53:41.885 --> 53:44.054
Mi-rae is going to serve at the bar.

53:44.137 --> 53:46.389
-What are you doing, Kyung-seok?
-Are you?

53:47.265 --> 53:48.767
-Yes.
-You said you were busy.

53:48.850 --> 53:50.185
Did I?

53:51.186 --> 53:53.146
Well, yes. I am busy.

53:53.563 --> 53:56.942
But the department needs my help.

54:00.570 --> 54:02.322
Are you coming to the festival?

54:03.073 --> 54:05.283
I don't know if I'll have time to come by.

54:05.367 --> 54:08.703
-I'll go when I'm done unpacking.
-Do you want me to help you?

54:08.828 --> 54:10.372
No, thanks.

54:10.455 --> 54:13.625
-Come over for the housewarming party.
-Good.

54:14.668 --> 54:16.962
-Come if you have time too, Mi-rae.
-Okay.

54:24.636 --> 54:25.929
You want to come, too?

54:26.012 --> 54:28.181
-Why are they going?
-Because...

54:28.890 --> 54:32.352
they live in the same neighborhood.
My new house is located near their house.

54:35.814 --> 54:37.857
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

54:38.024 --> 54:39.234
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

54:50.537 --> 54:54.332
Hey, I get nervous drinking
with those handsome guys.

54:54.416 --> 54:57.377
The tension keeps me sober,
don't you think?

55:01.548 --> 55:02.841
Hey.

55:03.174 --> 55:04.759
When will you hold the party?

55:07.554 --> 55:08.930
Are you really coming?

55:12.142 --> 55:14.060
You're more sociable than you look.

55:15.103 --> 55:17.647
Or do you like one of them?

55:22.360 --> 55:24.529
Let's set a date
that works for everyone.

55:24.654 --> 55:26.197
I'm going this way. You?

55:29.451 --> 55:30.744
Bye.

55:47.844 --> 55:49.637
-Hello.
-Hello.

55:53.767 --> 55:55.685
Slow down.

55:58.521 --> 56:00.523
Mi-rae, you're really slim.

56:00.607 --> 56:02.859
-What?
-I'm envious of your pretty looks.

56:02.942 --> 56:04.194
Me?

56:04.611 --> 56:06.905
You look way prettier, though.

56:06.988 --> 56:10.700
Please don't.
Guys always tease me for being fat.

56:10.784 --> 56:11.993
You aren't fat.

56:12.494 --> 56:14.913
Right, you're not fat at all.

56:15.538 --> 56:18.208
Guys and girls have different standards
in being fat.

56:18.833 --> 56:21.836
She should be considered average weight,
don't you think so?

56:22.462 --> 56:23.380
What?

56:24.172 --> 56:25.590
She's rather chubby.

56:30.261 --> 56:33.765
I thought you were cute and pretty
when I saw you.

56:33.848 --> 56:35.308
Don't say that.

56:35.517 --> 56:39.020
To be honest, a lot of people say
I might look pretty if I lose weight.

56:39.145 --> 56:40.730
But losing weight isn't easy.

56:42.857 --> 56:45.610
It's really hard to lose weight.

56:46.528 --> 56:48.238
Tae-hee.

56:49.072 --> 56:50.365
There you go again.

56:50.615 --> 56:52.367
I'll take this away for your sake.

56:53.201 --> 56:57.789
You said you'd go on a diet. Your whole
life will change only if you lose weight.

56:58.248 --> 57:00.125
Why would you do that?
She's eating.

57:00.750 --> 57:04.629
I just feel sorry
how she's wasting her pretty face.

57:04.712 --> 57:07.966
She's cute even when she's fat.
Imagine if she lost weight.

57:08.174 --> 57:11.344
You promised,
so make some effort.

57:11.428 --> 57:12.804
-Hurry, guys.
-Okay.

57:12.887 --> 57:14.514
I never made that promise.

57:14.597 --> 57:16.766
Thank you for your compliment
about my face,

57:16.850 --> 57:19.144
but let me take care of my life myself.

57:19.227 --> 57:21.563
You've been saying that for a year.

57:21.688 --> 57:24.107
You can be as pretty as Sua
once you lose weight.

57:25.024 --> 57:28.820
Please don't. I'm not even pretty.
People might criticize me.

57:28.903 --> 57:31.364
I'm sure Sua's also making effort.

57:31.448 --> 57:33.575
She must go on diets too, right?

57:35.493 --> 57:38.413
My skinny body has been my concern
since I was little.

57:39.205 --> 57:40.582
I see.

57:41.082 --> 57:44.794
Come on, Sua.
The girls might get annoyed.

57:45.962 --> 57:48.548
-There are people who never gain weight.
-Of course.

57:49.507 --> 57:50.925
How's the preparation going?

57:51.092 --> 57:55.305
I don't think we have enough tables,
so can we prepare a few mats just in case?

57:55.388 --> 57:56.890
That'd be good.

57:56.973 --> 58:00.518
-Haven't the uniforms arrived yet?
-They're here.

58:04.981 --> 58:06.900
What's taking the girls so long?

58:06.983 --> 58:09.611
-They're getting changed.
-Gosh, I can't wait to see them.

58:12.947 --> 58:16.367
I wish I was born as a pretty girl
so that I could just take the orders.

58:16.451 --> 58:18.036
We are running the bar.

58:19.078 --> 58:21.706
The chemistry department runs it.
Come visit our bar.

58:21.789 --> 58:23.041
-Okay.
-Okay.

58:24.792 --> 58:26.920
I feel too apologetic towards Jung-boon.

58:27.003 --> 58:28.880
You should apologize then.

58:28.963 --> 58:31.966
I mean, I feel too sorry to apologize.

58:32.050 --> 58:33.968
Then apologize for being really sorry.

58:35.512 --> 58:36.554
Let's go.

58:37.138 --> 58:38.515
Go where?

58:39.015 --> 58:40.391
Our department's bar.

58:41.017 --> 58:42.769
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

58:44.437 --> 58:45.855
That's the uniform?

58:46.523 --> 58:49.275
-I don't like it.
-Me, neither.

59:29.983 --> 59:33.528
<i>I can sense the breeze of success already.</i>
<i>It's just as I imagined.</i>

59:33.611 --> 59:34.737
Why, these punks...

59:34.821 --> 59:37.031
Why do you nag me?
Is there somebody?

59:37.115 --> 59:38.032
Hi.

59:38.116 --> 59:39.993
-She's that pretty girl.
-Kang Mi-rae?

59:40.076 --> 59:42.579
What's wrong? I'm just glad
to see Kang Orc again.

59:42.662 --> 59:43.580
Hey!

59:43.663 --> 59:46.082
His profile shows
which schools he went to.

59:46.165 --> 59:48.543
<i>Sua might have done it on purpose.</i>

59:48.626 --> 59:51.087
She was cute. Mi-rae was cute.

59:51.170 --> 59:53.590
I'm being careful.
She's from our department.

59:53.673 --> 59:54.757
<i>Can't we just point?</i>

59:54.841 --> 59:56.676
<i>Who is it that you like?</i>

59:56.801 --> 59:58.011
This person.
