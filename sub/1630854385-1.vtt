WEBVTT

00:06.310 --> 00:07.659
You guys are good?

00:07.703 --> 00:08.791
Awesome.

00:08.834 --> 00:10.401
Oh.

00:11.359 --> 00:12.490
We're rolling.

00:12.534 --> 00:14.318
What I've done
for the last 20 years

00:14.362 --> 00:16.494
is direct response marketing.

00:16.538 --> 00:19.280
I make... millions.

00:19.323 --> 00:21.282
Hey, you gotta do what you gotta
do for money.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.327
I'm like the Wizard of Oz.

00:23.371 --> 00:27.505
Lisa and I met the first
Sundance that I lived in Utah.

00:27.549 --> 00:30.334
I know she has my back. I know
she wants what's best for me.

00:30.378 --> 00:33.076
I know there's
no ulterior motive there.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.645
She was like, "Oh, my God.
You're amazing,"

00:36.688 --> 00:38.516
and I just felt
the same way about her.

00:38.560 --> 00:42.564
I just really like that Meredith
is 100% Meredith all the time.

00:42.607 --> 00:45.306
She's super consistent,
and she's a great person.

00:45.349 --> 00:47.830
Heather and I have been friends
for years.

00:47.873 --> 00:50.920
We are actually cousins.
We are bloodline relatives.

00:50.963 --> 00:52.182
She's the best human I know,

00:52.226 --> 00:54.706
and she's such a good friend
to me.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.405
She never explodes on me.
I can tell her anything I want,

00:57.448 --> 01:00.408
critical or otherwise, and I
know that she will listen,

01:00.451 --> 01:02.627
and we can talk it out.

01:06.936 --> 01:08.459
Our time is coming.

01:08.503 --> 01:11.723
I just can't lie to you.
This is a test for all of us.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.249
I wanna----ing kill myself.

01:15.292 --> 01:16.380
Jen, you know what? Right now--

01:16.424 --> 01:18.556
And just not be here.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.255
Everything's been taken away
from me!

01:21.298 --> 01:22.604
Everything!

01:24.214 --> 01:25.476
- Confide in you, Lisa.
- You haven't.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.652
'Cause I never
fully trusted you.

01:27.696 --> 01:29.306
I was talking to myself!

01:29.350 --> 01:31.569
I was ranting
like normal people do!

01:31.613 --> 01:33.136
- To speak about your...
- Yeah.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.878
...dear friend that way. Okay.

01:35.921 --> 01:37.488
- You are my girl, Heather.
- Is it possible you're wrong...

01:37.532 --> 01:39.142
- No. No.
- ...and making it all about you?

01:39.186 --> 01:40.752
No.

01:40.796 --> 01:43.407
Show up for your people.

01:43.451 --> 01:46.193
You are saying our friendship
is bullsh--.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.934
That----ing hurts me, Heather.

01:48.978 --> 01:52.895
you for calling me
a----ing liar!

01:52.938 --> 01:54.592
You called me a liar.

01:54.636 --> 01:57.334
You lost <i>me,</i> bitch.
You lost me.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.775
But what people don't know
about Salt Lake City

02:03.819 --> 02:06.952
is what lies beneath
that image of perfection.

02:06.996 --> 02:08.563
Let me say that again.

02:10.478 --> 02:13.307
This is so unnerving. Okay.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.168
- Hey, John.
- Oh, you look great.

02:48.211 --> 02:50.170
Thanks. Um, I'm gonna head out.

02:50.213 --> 02:51.736
I'm gonna head to lunch
right now.

02:51.780 --> 02:54.304
Oh, yeah?
How you feeling about it?

02:54.348 --> 02:56.001
Um, I'll let you know
when I'm done.

02:56.045 --> 02:58.482
- Okay. Looking forward to it.
- Okay, love you.

02:58.526 --> 03:00.267
All right, love you.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.055
<i>Hello?</i>

03:06.098 --> 03:07.535
Hi. How are you?

03:07.578 --> 03:09.624
<i>Good. I just got out
of a meeting. How are you?</i>

03:09.667 --> 03:14.672
Oh, I'm good. I'm actually on
my way to, um, meet someone.

03:14.716 --> 03:16.805
I'll probably be, like,
a little unreachable

03:16.848 --> 03:19.024
for a few hours.

03:26.728 --> 03:28.773
Well, hello.

03:28.817 --> 03:30.732
You were literally
around the corner.

03:30.775 --> 03:32.995
- I wasn't kidding.
- No.

03:33.038 --> 03:35.215
You look cute.

03:35.258 --> 03:36.955
Oh, I love it.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.176
- Hey, Heather.
- Hi.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.786
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

03:41.830 --> 03:44.354
- Good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

03:46.487 --> 03:50.186
- This is beautiful.
- Isn't it nice?

03:50.230 --> 03:54.103
Oh, my gosh.
What a gorgeous view.

03:54.146 --> 03:57.062
Not too chilly, and the hot tub
will feel nice and warm.

03:58.716 --> 04:02.154
Okay.
Put our stuff in a locker.

04:02.198 --> 04:03.591
If someone asked me
eight months ago

04:03.634 --> 04:06.681
if I'd be hanging out
with Jen...

04:06.724 --> 04:09.727
I would look at them
like they were crazy.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.773
Did you like a comment
referring to my son

04:11.816 --> 04:12.861
as a sissy bitch?

04:12.904 --> 04:16.604
- No!
- It's your----ing Twitter, Jen!

04:18.475 --> 04:20.129
Miracles do happen.

04:20.172 --> 04:23.132
Oh, this looks so pretty.
I can't wait to get in.

04:23.175 --> 04:24.699
This looks phenomenal.

04:24.742 --> 04:27.005
When Jen and I were in L.A.,

04:27.049 --> 04:29.399
I think that she sort of
got an understanding

04:29.443 --> 04:31.749
of everything that
I went through last winter.

04:31.793 --> 04:33.577
I had some very serious issues

04:33.621 --> 04:35.275
well beyond just losing
my father.

04:35.318 --> 04:41.933
My reactions, everything was
amplified a million times over.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.718
I totally understand,
and, Meredith, honestly,

04:43.761 --> 04:48.592
when I saw you,
I saw myself a year ago.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.420
Thank you.

04:50.464 --> 04:54.511
Cheers. Here's to a new year
and a new us.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.470
I will drink to that.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.820
No more fighting.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.432
It's just all love
from here on out.

05:02.476 --> 05:05.609
Yeah. It was--
It was a tough winter

05:05.653 --> 05:07.655
for both of us, you know?

05:07.698 --> 05:09.439
Yeah. What are you feeling
right now

05:09.483 --> 05:13.835
after Lisa going on her tirade?

05:20.102 --> 05:22.365
- I felt that.
- It's a process, and I mean,

05:22.409 --> 05:24.454
I'm still dealing with it
in a lot of ways.

05:24.498 --> 05:26.630
- Oh, yeah.
- And I'm sure I will be

05:26.674 --> 05:28.153
for a while, you know?
- Yeah.

05:28.197 --> 05:30.155
I've been going through so much,
and you know,

05:30.199 --> 05:33.420
my trial starts in, like,
a month and a half.

05:38.990 --> 05:41.515
And so I'm trying to plan

05:41.558 --> 05:44.300
a birthday party
for Coach Shah,

05:44.344 --> 05:47.129
just to show Coach I--
how much I appreciate him.

05:47.172 --> 05:51.916
And so I was planning
on inviting Lisa and John.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.615
How's everything going?

05:54.658 --> 05:56.312
- I mean, good.
- Here's a water for you.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.141
She's gonna--She's gonna take
a Vida Paloma, too.

05:59.184 --> 06:00.708
- Excellent. Would you like poco?
- I ordered for you.

06:00.751 --> 06:04.755
Yeah, I-I trust Lisa explicitly
with alcohol, so...

06:04.799 --> 06:08.759
I agreed to meet with Lisa
because she said she needed me,

06:08.803 --> 06:11.240
and she's never said
she's needed me before.

06:11.283 --> 06:12.502
I never called Heather Shrek.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.025
Oh, you've called me
horrible things, Lisa.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.418
I have never called you Shrek.
I have never--

06:15.462 --> 06:18.029
You've called me
a LEGO figurine.

06:18.073 --> 06:19.640
The fact that she's scraping
the bottom of the barrel

06:19.683 --> 06:21.468
to call me, the--probably
the last person on the earth

06:21.511 --> 06:23.034
that she wants to call?

06:23.078 --> 06:27.082
If I can do something
of value for Lisa,

06:27.125 --> 06:31.478
then maybe she won't hate me
as much.

06:31.521 --> 06:33.567
To us.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.395
To us.
I didn't expect that, but okay.

06:35.438 --> 06:37.788
For me, it's, like,
very uncomfortable to say this,

06:37.832 --> 06:41.401
but, like, I need some help
with Meredith.

06:41.444 --> 06:44.055
I feel like you are able to
navigate situations differently.

06:44.099 --> 06:45.622
Like, I feel like you say
what you're thinking,

06:45.666 --> 06:47.015
you say what you're feeling.

06:47.058 --> 06:49.278
And you, like,
end up, like, fine,

06:49.321 --> 06:53.238
and I feel like now, I'm like,
like the worst person on earth,

06:53.282 --> 06:55.327
in, like, Meredith's eyes.
- Like you've been banished.

06:55.371 --> 06:56.154
I need your advice.
I need help.

06:56.198 --> 06:57.678
Well...

06:57.721 --> 07:00.463
What is most sacred to Meredith?
If I were to ask you,

07:00.507 --> 07:01.856
without any influence--
- Her family.

07:01.899 --> 07:03.031
- Okay.
- Yeah. Her family.

07:03.074 --> 07:05.207
Yeah. And you came
for her family?

07:05.250 --> 07:06.774
I didn't feel like
I came for her family.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.340
I was in a blind rage.
It wasn't intentional.

07:08.384 --> 07:09.603
- Listen...
- I get it.

07:09.646 --> 07:11.387
Regardless, it's on the table.
You did.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.171
So you have to make it right.

07:13.215 --> 07:15.173
The questions that are gonna be
asked are

07:15.217 --> 07:18.176
is that how you really feel
about Meredith?

07:18.220 --> 07:20.265
What do you think?

07:20.309 --> 07:22.485
I think that's how you really
feel about Meredith.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.792
No. No. No. No.

07:24.835 --> 07:26.358
I don't know.
I'm still trying to figure out

07:26.402 --> 07:28.665
where I stand on everything.

07:28.709 --> 07:30.450
I mean, she went through

07:30.493 --> 07:32.452
and completely defamed
my character

07:32.495 --> 07:34.454
on things that just aren't true.

07:37.674 --> 07:40.416
And so then you say,
"Well, where did this come from?

07:40.460 --> 07:43.114
Are you listening to rumors
and spreading rumors?

07:43.158 --> 07:45.116
Because at the end of the day,
I'm hearing rumors

07:45.160 --> 07:47.162
left, right, and center.
- About Lisa?

07:47.205 --> 07:51.427
About Lisa.
And am I spreading them? No.

07:51.471 --> 07:55.953
So let's see. Is it--Is it just
her projecting her own truth,

07:55.997 --> 07:59.479
or is it just she decided to be
a total asshole

07:59.522 --> 08:01.350
'cause she was angry?

08:01.393 --> 08:07.182
The sh-- Lisa Barlow said about
her "sister" and best friend?

08:07.225 --> 08:10.968
What Meredith needs to do is
monetize that.

08:11.012 --> 08:14.711
Make "Garbage trash whore"
T-shirts.

08:14.755 --> 08:17.453
So what rumors are you hearing?

08:18.541 --> 08:21.718
Um...

08:21.762 --> 08:23.938
There have been question marks
surrounding her marriage,

08:23.981 --> 08:27.942
um... her business
and her finances.

08:27.985 --> 08:29.813
Do I really wanna dig
into Lisa's stuff?

08:29.857 --> 08:31.423
No, I really have no interest.

08:31.467 --> 08:33.643
But if you're going to sit there
talking about everyone else,

08:33.687 --> 08:35.906
fair game on her at this point.

08:35.950 --> 08:38.561
Fair game.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.520
I mean, there are--
there are affair rumors.

08:40.563 --> 08:42.565
I'm not getting into any of it,
but there are rumors.

08:42.609 --> 08:45.307
I don't know
if they're true or false.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.569
Um... but the exist.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.528
Yeah, I've heard the same thing.

08:50.051 --> 08:52.227
Even if you feel like
what you said is justified,

08:52.270 --> 08:54.055
if you feel like what you said--

08:54.098 --> 08:55.752
I didn't feel like it was
justified, just so--

08:55.796 --> 08:57.188
I mean, we have to be clear
about that.

08:57.232 --> 08:59.060
- I'm very clear about that.
- It doesn't even matter.

08:59.103 --> 09:00.670
It's like,
you're in the position

09:00.714 --> 09:02.367
where you have to say,
"I didn't mean it.

09:02.411 --> 09:05.022
It was a moment, and I'm going
to have to eat sh-- for it

09:05.066 --> 09:06.894
for a long time."

09:06.937 --> 09:09.984
I don't think humble pie
is something that Lisa

09:10.027 --> 09:13.291
likes to eat, will ever eat,

09:13.335 --> 09:17.382
or will for sure never pretend
to enjoy eating.

09:17.426 --> 09:19.776
And all three of those things
need to occur

09:19.820 --> 09:21.691
for her to bridge this gap
with Meredith.

09:21.735 --> 09:23.519
I've eaten so much humble pie,

09:23.563 --> 09:25.739
it's amazing I still fit
in this dress.

09:25.782 --> 09:28.959
I think there needs to be give
on both sides, honestly.

09:29.003 --> 09:31.353
But the bigger side
has to come from you.

09:31.396 --> 09:32.702
- Okay.
- Because you said

09:32.746 --> 09:36.880
the mean things
that are out there forever.

09:36.924 --> 09:41.058
Okay, I hear you. I hear you.

09:46.455 --> 09:47.891
<i>Coming up...</i>

09:47.935 --> 09:49.545
If you say to the Church,

09:49.589 --> 09:51.242
"I want you
to ex-communicate me.

09:51.286 --> 09:52.722
I want to remove my name
from the records,"

09:52.766 --> 09:56.291
what changes
in your day-to-day life?

10:06.954 --> 10:08.825
What's up, Bobbie Rose?

10:11.698 --> 10:13.525
Wait, what?

10:13.569 --> 10:15.963
Pros and cons about guys?

10:16.006 --> 10:17.791
- Yes!
- What do you mean by guys?

10:17.834 --> 10:20.750
- Like, men.
- Like, <i>men?</i>

10:20.794 --> 10:22.143
Yes.

10:22.186 --> 10:23.579
How old are you, Bobbi Rose?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.799
Let me see what you got. Pros...

10:25.842 --> 10:27.888
Athletic.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.150
- Good style.
- Nice.

10:29.193 --> 10:32.022
- That's a big one. Hi, Dad.
- Hey.

10:32.066 --> 10:33.589
Dad, come look at this.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.286
She's writing
a pros and cons list about guys.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.680
You're gonna take that one up
with your daddy.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.160
Well, I'm really worried

10:39.203 --> 10:41.989
that there's not as many cons
as there are pros.

10:42.032 --> 10:43.817
I don't know how I feel
about that.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.688
Whit?

10:45.732 --> 10:46.994
- Hello!
- Hey!

10:47.037 --> 10:49.779
Get in here.
I need a rescue right now.

10:49.823 --> 10:50.954
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:50.998 --> 10:52.434
- You need a rescue?
- Yes, I need--

10:52.477 --> 10:53.522
What's going on?

10:53.565 --> 10:54.436
I need--I need you
to tag in here.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.568
- Hi, Bobbie.
- Hi.

10:56.612 --> 10:57.874
This is a department
I don't know much about.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.571
What's up?
What are we working on?

10:59.615 --> 11:01.095
Pros and cons about guys.

11:01.138 --> 11:02.792
Well, it's gonna be hard
to get any cons from me, Bobbie.

11:04.272 --> 11:06.622
She's completely
and utterly boy-crazy.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.972
Sixth grade.
Like, think of sixth grade.

11:09.016 --> 11:11.366
I didn't have my first kiss
till 15.

11:11.409 --> 11:12.672
That's too long!

11:12.715 --> 11:14.412
I didn't have my first kiss
till 15 either.

11:14.456 --> 11:15.587
Oh, my gosh. Okay.

11:15.631 --> 11:17.372
But I still wanted it
in sixth grade.

11:18.329 --> 11:19.809
I was a good little Mormon girl,

11:19.853 --> 11:21.550
and I followed all the rules.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.160
I was not interested in boys

11:23.204 --> 11:26.076
until the Mormon Handbook
told me I could be.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.818
I just put,
"Doesn't do what's asked of me,"

11:28.862 --> 11:30.298
so I think they don't listen
to me.

11:30.341 --> 11:32.822
Honey, you gotta take that
off your list.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.519
You don't want someone

11:34.563 --> 11:37.348
that does exactly what
you ask them to do all the time.

11:37.392 --> 11:40.351
Bobbie Rose has some
ridiculously high standards.

11:40.395 --> 11:42.702
I think you can dress a guy.
I don't think style matters.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.181
Oh, yeah. That is true.

11:44.225 --> 11:45.792
I just wanna take, like,
a Sharpie

11:45.835 --> 11:47.358
and just be like,
"Never gonna get it.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.143
Never gonna get it.
Never gonna get it.

11:49.186 --> 11:50.840
Settle. Settle. Settle."

11:50.884 --> 11:53.016
Not attractive. Ugly sex--
it's gonna change your life.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.757
Let's switch that one over, too.

11:57.281 --> 11:59.196
I want to be as hopeful
as Bobbie Rose

11:59.240 --> 12:01.808
when I make out
my pros and cons list, honestly.

12:01.851 --> 12:04.375
- Let's go downstairs.
- What can I get you to drink?

12:04.419 --> 12:06.377
Whatever you guys are drinking.

12:06.421 --> 12:09.554
There's rosé
or a really nice tequila.

12:09.598 --> 12:14.168
You know what? In a nod to me
being Team Lisa Barlow lately,

12:14.211 --> 12:15.560
let's do a tequila.

12:15.604 --> 12:16.910
All right. Got you.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.392
- Hi. <i>
- Hi. [laughs]</i>

12:21.436 --> 12:23.046
<i>I need to talk to you.
I'm dying.</i>

12:23.090 --> 12:24.961
What's going on?

12:25.005 --> 12:26.920
<i>I'm on my way to meet up
with Lisa.</i>

12:28.704 --> 12:32.186
It's good. As much as I wanna
be like, "No! Run,"

12:32.229 --> 12:33.796
we need to get over our sh--.

12:35.929 --> 12:38.061
- When did you do this?
- Yeah, we made it a speakeasy.

12:38.105 --> 12:39.149
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:39.193 --> 12:40.542
And you can lock
the bookshelves.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.196
- It has the lock up top.
- Oh, my gosh.

12:42.239 --> 12:45.590
This is so cool...
you guys. Yes!

12:45.634 --> 12:47.418
Feels good to me, too.

12:47.462 --> 12:49.246
I love it, and, like,
close the door, padlock it,

12:49.290 --> 12:50.900
don't let the kids in.

12:50.944 --> 12:52.815
The fact that we have a bar
in our home is a big deal.

12:52.859 --> 12:55.426
I never knew anyone with a bar.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.733
I remember, like,
going to my friend's house,

12:57.777 --> 12:59.866
and, like, seeing her parents,
like, drinking wine,

12:59.909 --> 13:02.520
and being like, "OMG."

13:04.087 --> 13:06.698
But, no, I, um, you know
I've been, like, on this, like,

13:06.742 --> 13:09.571
healing journey,
and I had a big healing session

13:09.614 --> 13:11.268
with Megan the other day.

13:11.312 --> 13:14.445
So the past keeps showing up
over and over.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.273
'Cause I don't have a memory
of it.

13:16.317 --> 13:18.885
Yeah, and I think that's what's
manifesting in your gut.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.190
It's wanting to stay
in the past,

13:20.234 --> 13:22.889
trying to resolve
what happened in the past.

13:22.932 --> 13:25.021
The great thing
about this trauma

13:25.065 --> 13:28.720
with your early childhood is
clearing out this old energy

13:28.764 --> 13:30.679
allows you to move forward.

13:30.722 --> 13:33.682
This energy we're gonna hand
to the universe.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.945
Up and over your body.

13:35.989 --> 13:37.468
Think of this trauma.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.906
Ask yourself,
"Is it still here?"

13:39.949 --> 13:42.778
- Can I hug you?
- Yes, please do.

13:42.822 --> 13:46.173
And it really hit me that
one of the biggest tethers

13:46.216 --> 13:50.438
or, like, wounds I have
is the Church.

13:50.481 --> 13:55.660
And I came to the realization
that I'm ready

13:55.704 --> 13:58.968
to close that chapter
and leave officially

13:59.012 --> 14:01.536
and ask them to remove my name.

14:04.365 --> 14:06.236
If you say to the Church,

14:06.280 --> 14:07.716
"I want you
to ex-communicate me.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.152
I want to remove my name
from the records,

14:09.196 --> 14:11.807
what changes
in your day-to-day life?

14:11.851 --> 14:14.201
Nothing changes
in my day-to-day life.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.333
But to know Whitney is to know

14:16.377 --> 14:19.336
that the freedom that comes
with the release

14:19.380 --> 14:21.817
is what she's truly, truly--

14:21.861 --> 14:23.601
So this is about inner...

14:23.645 --> 14:25.734
I'm doing this
for Bobbie and Brooks

14:25.777 --> 14:28.868
so that they do not
fall into my cycle

14:28.911 --> 14:33.002
of limited beliefs,
of not being good enough,

14:33.046 --> 14:34.699
and not being heard.

14:34.743 --> 14:38.051
Having my name on the record
of the Mormon Church

14:38.094 --> 14:41.184
means that they're still
tracking what I'm doing.

14:41.228 --> 14:42.707
That means that they still

14:42.751 --> 14:44.622
send people to my house
to check on me.

14:44.666 --> 14:45.928
They still come
to collect money.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.887
Even when you move,
they know where you move,

14:47.930 --> 14:49.627
and your record transfers.

14:49.671 --> 14:51.281
- It makes sense.
- You have to understand,

14:51.325 --> 14:53.414
I still have this tether...

14:53.457 --> 14:55.024
- Well, yeah, that's--
- ...to this programming,

14:55.068 --> 14:56.504
to this mindset...
- Indoctrination.

14:56.547 --> 14:59.072
...and so, like,
the treatment of women,

14:59.115 --> 15:02.902
about women are subordinate
to men, I wanna break that,

15:02.945 --> 15:05.905
because I am a woman,
and I can do whatever I want

15:05.948 --> 15:07.776
because I'm a human.

15:07.819 --> 15:10.692
When you do this process,
you are saying...

15:10.735 --> 15:12.650
- I'm done.
- ...I choose outer darkness...

15:12.694 --> 15:14.565
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and no communion with God

15:14.609 --> 15:17.917
over being numbered as a member
of the Mormon Church?

15:17.960 --> 15:19.875
The Mormons believe
that our names are recorded,

15:19.919 --> 15:21.964
like, in a ledger for God.

15:22.008 --> 15:25.098
When you elect to have your name
removed from the list,

15:25.141 --> 15:26.882
it's like a steel door

15:26.926 --> 15:31.408
on their version of heaven
and their community forever.

15:31.452 --> 15:32.409
What do you have to do
right now?

15:32.453 --> 15:34.324
Like, what's gonna happen?

15:34.368 --> 15:38.198
I can literally, literally go
to QuitMormon.com.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.461
How easy is that?

15:41.766 --> 15:43.507
I mean, there's no doubt
watching her do this

15:43.551 --> 15:48.643
that I'm thinking, "Can I,
will I, would I ever do this?"

15:48.686 --> 15:50.688
"I demand that
you remove my name

15:50.732 --> 15:52.429
completely from your records
within..."

15:52.473 --> 15:54.866
"Five business days
of receipt."

15:54.910 --> 15:56.607
- Wow.
- I printed it.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.087
But, like,
even with my dad gone,

15:58.131 --> 15:59.697
I still wanna be
a good daughter,

15:59.741 --> 16:01.177
and even with my mom
not speaking to me,

16:01.221 --> 16:05.007
I still wanna be
a good daughter.

16:08.576 --> 16:13.450
And... I don't know
if my family would recover

16:13.494 --> 16:15.061
if they knew I did that.

16:15.104 --> 16:19.630
I've done a lot of sh--ty things
to Mormonism, you know?

16:19.674 --> 16:21.545
I've hurt my family
in so many ways,

16:21.589 --> 16:22.982
but I feel like that would be,

16:23.025 --> 16:26.028
like, the final knife
in their back.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.291
And I'm not there yet.

16:28.335 --> 16:31.338
- Heather.
- You printed it?

16:31.381 --> 16:33.470
This is the letter.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.436
Holy sh--.

16:42.479 --> 16:44.873
Do you feel like there's
anything there for you?

16:44.916 --> 16:47.441
Babe, I can't sign this
fast enough.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.922
Thank you for being here
for me, Heather.

16:50.966 --> 16:52.489
- I know you hate--
- Babe, you are my exemplar.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.926
- You are fearless.
- I know you hate

16:54.970 --> 16:56.711
when I get all mushy
and touchy-feely on you.

16:56.754 --> 16:59.931
Bring it in. I love
a little mush. I love you.

16:59.975 --> 17:02.369
You are...

17:04.066 --> 17:05.633
<i>Coming up...</i>

17:05.676 --> 17:11.639
She's questioning our finances,
yet I see SEC documents that

17:11.682 --> 17:14.381
say that their company's
not making money.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.528
Hey, you know the fireplace?

17:31.572 --> 17:34.792
How do you turn that on?

17:34.836 --> 17:38.100
Okay, I'm gonna put you
on FaceTime. Okay, hold on.

17:38.144 --> 17:41.582
<i>Okay, so bring me closer.
It's on the left.</i>

17:41.625 --> 17:42.931
- Right here? <i>
- Okay.</i>

17:42.974 --> 17:44.237
<i>And then to the right,
you see those knobs?</i>

17:44.280 --> 17:46.065
Oh, right here.

17:46.108 --> 17:49.720
<i>Put it on "pilot,"
and then push that red button.</i>

17:49.764 --> 17:53.115
I've been adjusting
to the new house. Okay?

17:53.159 --> 17:55.378
I went from 9,000 square feet...

18:00.992 --> 18:02.907
...to half of that.

18:02.951 --> 18:06.824
I went from the
Barbie Dreamhouse closet, okay?

18:06.868 --> 18:10.132
- Oh, my gosh. Jen.
- So...

18:10.176 --> 18:11.960
I love this.

18:12.003 --> 18:15.398
...to, like,
a normal-sized closet.

18:18.140 --> 18:21.143
<i>- Cool?</i>
- Yeah...

18:22.840 --> 18:25.800
Coach Shah, who is the voice
of reason in our marriage,

18:25.843 --> 18:28.803
sat me down,
and we discussed this.

18:28.846 --> 18:32.633
We can get a smaller spot.
We don't have to pay as much.

18:32.676 --> 18:35.462
Because
the most important thing is

18:35.505 --> 18:37.464
being able to fight
for your freedom.

18:38.726 --> 18:40.554
- Hi, honey.
- What are you doing?

18:40.597 --> 18:43.209
I'm trying to start
the fireplace.

18:43.252 --> 18:46.212
Oh, honey. It's better
just to leave it alone.

18:46.255 --> 18:47.691
Along with downsizing the house,

18:47.735 --> 18:50.390
I also had to downsize
the Shah Squad.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.783
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

18:52.827 --> 18:54.829
So I'm doing my best.
That's all I can say.

18:54.872 --> 18:57.179
I'm doing my very, very best.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.876
How was work today?

18:58.920 --> 19:01.270
Long. Long, baby.

19:01.314 --> 19:03.751
Baby, can I get a coffee?
That'll be nice.

19:03.794 --> 19:04.839
Okay.

19:04.882 --> 19:07.320
A coffee or tea or something?

19:07.363 --> 19:09.017
Um... let's talk about the party.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.192
Okay.

19:10.236 --> 19:13.108
This is Coach's 51st birthday.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.807
Angie Katsanevas said I could
use her house to hold it.

19:16.851 --> 19:19.419
Angie and I have been friends
since college.

19:19.462 --> 19:20.942
She also went to high school
with Heather.

19:20.985 --> 19:23.727
She's good friends with Lisa. <i></i>

19:23.771 --> 19:26.513
So when she offered up
her house,

19:26.556 --> 19:28.036
I'm like, this will be perfect.

19:28.079 --> 19:31.518
Obviously, this will be
little cocktail tables.

19:31.561 --> 19:33.520
We've got the piano player
in the corner.

19:33.563 --> 19:35.739
- Back in the corner.
- Oh, with an actual piano?

19:35.783 --> 19:37.001
- Yes.
- Jen's got a piano player.

19:37.045 --> 19:38.351
We're dropping a piano here Friday.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.657
I'm used to hosting
these parties at my house.

19:40.701 --> 19:42.355
Make way for the dancers.

19:45.401 --> 19:49.318
But every penny is literally
going to fighting my case.

19:49.362 --> 19:52.582
You might not think this,
but I can operate on a budget.

19:52.626 --> 19:55.194
The theme of the party is
"Harlem Nights,"

19:55.237 --> 19:56.499
'cause you love that movie.

19:56.543 --> 19:58.371
Okay, honey.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.808
You remember we're in Utah, okay?

20:00.851 --> 20:02.375
- I know that.
- Salt Lake City,

20:02.418 --> 20:04.551
and "Harlem Nights"
was in Harlem.

20:04.594 --> 20:06.901
Lot of Black folks,
which we're void of here.

20:06.944 --> 20:08.816
So we going to import
Black people here?

20:08.859 --> 20:09.991
- Like, what are we gon' do?
- Yes. Yes, we are.

20:10.034 --> 20:13.081
- So I'm--I'm inviting the bruhs.
- Who?

20:13.124 --> 20:14.952
- Your fraternity brothers.
- Which ones?

20:14.996 --> 20:16.954
- The ones here are coming.
- That's what's up. Okay. Good.

20:16.998 --> 20:19.348
Okay?
Some of our family's coming.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.742
- Who else is coming?
- I invited Heather and Whitney.

20:21.785 --> 20:24.092
I was planning on inviting
Lisa and John

20:24.135 --> 20:26.703
'cause I know you would want
John there at your party.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.966
But Meredith's gonna be there.

20:32.405 --> 20:34.929
What I don't want is to use
a party as some platform

20:34.972 --> 20:36.191
for somebody
to confront something.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.411
"Oh, I need to tell her
about how I feel."

20:38.454 --> 20:41.501
Do that sh-- someplace else.
There's a lot of other things

20:41.544 --> 20:43.764
that are so much more important
than this,

20:43.807 --> 20:46.680
and what I wanna do
is have a good time.

20:48.029 --> 20:51.641
As we come closer to,
you know, the trial date,

20:51.685 --> 20:54.078
that in and of itself
is a lot to deal with.

20:54.122 --> 20:56.733
My trial is seven weeks
from today.

20:56.777 --> 20:58.996
It's on March 22nd.

21:07.178 --> 21:10.834
I'm the only defendant left
that is still going to trial.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.448
I have no idea what's going on

21:15.491 --> 21:17.188
with the other defendants
in this case.

21:17.232 --> 21:20.148
I have no idea why
they've taken a plea deal.

21:20.191 --> 21:23.325
But I'm not gonna take
a plea deal when I'm not guilty.

21:23.369 --> 21:24.805
I'm innocent.

21:24.848 --> 21:27.373
We need to get to New York
for a pre-trial meeting,

21:27.416 --> 21:30.854
and more than anything, it's
just a million tons of documents

21:30.898 --> 21:33.814
that we have to continue
to review and analyze.

21:33.857 --> 21:38.035
I would be lying if I said
I wasn't scared.

21:38.079 --> 21:40.821
I'm not thinking about myself.
I'm thinking about my family.

21:40.864 --> 21:44.390
I can't imagine being away
from them.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.870
It would literally kill me.

21:46.914 --> 21:49.133
There's still other individuals
we need to talk to

21:49.177 --> 21:51.875
regarding their participation
in the trial.

21:51.919 --> 21:53.181
There's a bunch of deadlines
they were telling me about.

21:53.224 --> 21:55.966
- Right.
- You know, coming up next week.

21:56.010 --> 21:58.665
We have a lot of things
that we have to get ready for.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.809
What did you get
ramen noodles for?

22:12.853 --> 22:15.682
Did you think we're
college students or something?

22:15.725 --> 22:17.379
- Who wants ramen noodles?
- Really?

22:17.423 --> 22:20.948
For a guy who can't keep a job,
this is what we eat.

22:27.563 --> 22:29.217
Next time, I can't send you.

22:29.260 --> 22:30.697
That's what happens when you
send me to the grocery store.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.481
- I should have never sent--
- I mean, really?

22:32.525 --> 22:33.743
- I mean, yes.
- Jelly?

22:33.787 --> 22:35.615
Well, the best brand
in the world.

22:35.658 --> 22:38.052
This is crazy.
This is a lot of stuff.

22:38.095 --> 22:39.923
- The groceries?
- No, just getting,

22:39.967 --> 22:42.448
like, situated here
and figuring it all out.

22:42.491 --> 22:45.276
The question is where do you
wanna trench down?

22:45.320 --> 22:47.453
I'm not ready to trench down
quite yet.

22:47.496 --> 22:52.588
I'm kind of having fun being,
like, an empty-nester wanderer.

22:52.632 --> 22:54.590
Our children are
out of the house.

22:54.634 --> 22:56.549
Seth is working remotely
for the most part.

22:56.592 --> 22:59.856
So we're enjoying being able
to go wherever we want,

22:59.900 --> 23:04.078
whenever we want,
and despite what Lisa says,

23:04.121 --> 23:07.255
I could own multiple homes
if I wanted to.

23:07.298 --> 23:09.213
The only reason I even care
about that commentary

23:09.257 --> 23:13.130
is not only could she hung you
and your career

23:13.174 --> 23:15.916
with spewing her nonsense B.S.,

23:15.959 --> 23:18.962
but you have 4,000 employees

23:19.006 --> 23:22.618
that her negative commentary
can impact their livelihood.

23:22.662 --> 23:24.359
That's pretty self-centered.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.926
What does Seth do, really?

23:25.969 --> 23:28.581
Well, what does John Barlow
do for a living

23:28.624 --> 23:30.887
other than follow Lisa around?

23:30.931 --> 23:34.630
I need a Diet Coke from Sonic.
I want Taco Bell.

23:34.674 --> 23:35.936
Two tables and four chairs.

23:35.979 --> 23:38.286
I'm gonna go inside
because it's cold.

23:38.329 --> 23:41.332
John is the best 'cause
I would not do that for him.

23:41.376 --> 23:42.812
Well, hurry,
'cause I gotta send wires.

23:42.856 --> 23:44.161
- Yep, I'll hurry.
- Let me get this done fast.

23:44.205 --> 23:45.946
Sorry I'm keeping you
from doing your job.

23:45.989 --> 23:48.688
Honestly, I totally understand
John Barlow.

23:49.819 --> 23:51.299
What can I do for you right now?

23:51.342 --> 23:53.649
We have our own business
together, so it's Lisa and I...

23:53.693 --> 23:54.955
Absolutely.

23:54.998 --> 23:55.869
...doing the business
with Vida.

23:55.912 --> 23:57.392
We own everything together.

24:02.179 --> 24:05.095
I can neither confirm nor deny.

24:05.139 --> 24:07.924
Is he responsible
for 4,000 employees?

24:07.968 --> 24:10.274
I mean, I hear that they own
this distillery in Mexico.

24:10.318 --> 24:13.103
Have they ever gone to Mexico
since we met them?

24:13.147 --> 24:17.107
She's questioning
our, you know, finances,

24:17.151 --> 24:20.981
yet I see SEC documents that

24:21.024 --> 24:22.939
their company
was not making money.

24:22.983 --> 24:24.419
- Fact.
- Really?

24:24.463 --> 24:27.944
It's a legal public document
that anyone can read.

24:27.988 --> 24:31.382
It just shows that
the Barlows were crowd-funding

24:31.426 --> 24:32.819
for their business.

24:32.862 --> 24:35.038
In 2018, the company
was reporting losses

24:35.082 --> 24:37.824
and had some outstanding debts.

24:37.867 --> 24:41.175
So it raises a question mark,
that's for sure.

24:41.218 --> 24:42.742
This is just like a projection.

24:42.785 --> 24:47.355
Like, she's busy questioning
our relationship,

24:47.398 --> 24:50.053
affairs, cheating,
whatever you wanna call it,

24:50.097 --> 24:52.055
sleeping with people,

24:52.099 --> 24:54.536
yet those rumors are flying
about her.

24:54.580 --> 25:00.586
Lisa tries to show this life
of perfection,

25:00.629 --> 25:02.196
and what I hear from others,

25:02.239 --> 25:04.111
if everything I'm hearing
is actually true,

25:04.154 --> 25:07.201
her life is... not so great.

25:07.244 --> 25:09.595
Like, that's the most
absurd thing unless

25:09.638 --> 25:13.033
you're super defensive because
you're hiding something else.

25:13.076 --> 25:15.992
I have never exchanged sex
for money.

25:16.036 --> 25:18.342
That's what a whore is.

25:18.386 --> 25:21.041
Maybe someone else has.
I don't know.

25:28.222 --> 25:32.574
- Did you reach out to her?
- Why would I reach out to <i>her?</i>

25:32.618 --> 25:35.708
I'm not reaching out to <i>her</i>
to ask <i>her</i> to apologize to me.

25:35.751 --> 25:37.361
That doesn't work.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.973
It's very sad that somebody
just wants to throw away

25:40.016 --> 25:42.410
a 10-year friendship
over some skeletons

25:42.453 --> 25:44.586
in their own closet.

25:56.946 --> 25:59.470
I'm not convinced that these
buttons are gonna work, but...

25:59.514 --> 26:02.735
Get 'em really in there.

26:02.778 --> 26:03.953
Throughout the party
and just pop!

26:05.999 --> 26:07.740
Should I wear pasties
just in case?

26:07.783 --> 26:09.829
I probably would.

26:13.920 --> 26:16.183
Let's get you in your dress, Jen.

26:16.226 --> 26:17.967
Let me go put my Spanx on.

26:18.011 --> 26:19.012
Okay.

26:21.014 --> 26:23.494
- I got brown right here.
- No.

26:23.538 --> 26:25.496
First of all,
that's not the vibe.

26:25.540 --> 26:28.804
- What is it? Brooklyn nights?
- Harlem. Really?

26:39.902 --> 26:42.905
Wow. It's beautiful.
Thank you so much.

26:44.472 --> 26:48.563
Love the cake.
This looks so good.

27:04.144 --> 27:06.363
Would you like a drink?

27:10.019 --> 27:12.152
Hi, Whitney!

27:12.195 --> 27:14.458
- Hi, Angie.
- Thank you so much for coming.

27:21.248 --> 27:24.033
- Working. He had an event.
- Oh, okay.

27:26.209 --> 27:29.822
- Hi, babe.
- Hi! Oh, hi!

27:29.865 --> 27:31.171
- Hi, gorgeous.
- Look at you!

27:31.214 --> 27:32.694
- Get over here.
- Oh, my gosh.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.391
Got our little tassels.

27:34.435 --> 27:35.741
I've known Angie K.
since I moved to Utah

27:35.784 --> 27:37.220
when I was 15 years old.

27:37.264 --> 27:39.701
At our 10-year reunion,
she, like, pulled up

27:39.745 --> 27:41.224
in, like, a Lamborghini.

27:41.268 --> 27:42.704
The rest of us had, like,
six kids

27:42.748 --> 27:45.707
and, like, we're wearing, like,
outfits from Old Navy.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.491
She was for sure

27:47.535 --> 27:49.319
the coolest girl
at the 10-year reunion.

27:49.363 --> 27:51.713
Look at you two BFFs, so cute.

27:51.757 --> 27:54.455
- We dearly love each other.
- We're--We're good.

27:54.498 --> 27:56.370
Kissin' cousins.
The kissin' cou--buzzin'.

27:56.413 --> 27:57.937
- The buzzin' cousins.
- The cousins.

28:00.287 --> 28:02.158
Ooh, this is pretty.

28:02.202 --> 28:05.292
It sounds like there's
fun happening. I love that.

28:05.335 --> 28:08.382
You know, I mean, I don't know
what I'm walking into tonight.

28:08.425 --> 28:10.601
Like, seeing Meredith
and Seth at this point

28:10.645 --> 28:12.386
is gonna be awkward.

28:12.429 --> 28:13.909
Hi! How are you?

28:13.953 --> 28:16.085
I know if the roles
were reversed,

28:16.129 --> 28:19.262
I would at least be open
to hearing the apology,

28:19.306 --> 28:21.917
and if it's sincere,
I'm sure I would accept it.

28:21.961 --> 28:23.789
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

28:23.832 --> 28:26.182
I wouldn'’t throw away
a 10-year friendship

28:26.226 --> 28:29.446
over one bad moment.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.974
Hey, you, you look so good.

28:35.017 --> 28:37.019
Thank you. You look great, too.
Glitz, glam, and gangster.

28:37.063 --> 28:39.021
- I know. Whoo! Hi, Whitney.
- Hi, Lisa.

28:39.065 --> 28:41.371
- Ooh, I like the hair, too.
- Thank you.

28:41.415 --> 28:42.851
How are you guys?
Should we cheer?

28:42.895 --> 28:43.896
Yes.

28:47.682 --> 28:51.164
Yeah, this is what it's supposed
to look like.

28:52.818 --> 28:53.775
Hey.

28:55.429 --> 28:57.692
Y'all, they just got here.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.389
Okay, come on in.

29:01.087 --> 29:02.741
Too much. Too much.

29:02.784 --> 29:04.786
That's why
I'm gonna get out of the scene.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.527
Oh, I think that's Jen.

29:06.570 --> 29:08.964
Whoo!

29:09.008 --> 29:10.574
Look at you!

29:12.838 --> 29:14.491
It's the birthday boy and girl.

29:14.535 --> 29:15.449
Cheers.

29:15.492 --> 29:16.755
I should have worn sequins.

29:16.798 --> 29:19.366
I'm, like, the only one
not sparkly.

29:19.409 --> 29:20.671
You look gorgeous,
worth the wait.

29:20.715 --> 29:23.196
- You, too. Oh, my gosh.
- Happy birthday!

29:23.239 --> 29:25.328
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

29:25.372 --> 29:27.417
The party looks
absolutely beautiful.

29:27.461 --> 29:29.550
- Hi.
- You look gorgeous.

29:29.593 --> 29:32.118
Now if I hosted this at <i>my</i> home,

29:32.161 --> 29:35.164
it would have been
a little bit different.

29:35.208 --> 29:37.688
It was hard for me to, like,
let go.

29:37.732 --> 29:39.647
- Thanks for having us.
- Come on, baby. I love you.

29:39.690 --> 29:41.736
- Thank you.
- And we're here for you guys

29:41.780 --> 29:43.129
if you need anything.

29:43.172 --> 29:45.479
Go, red. Uhh!
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.

29:47.742 --> 29:48.612
- Easy 8.
- Oh!

29:48.656 --> 29:49.831
Easy 8 over here.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.833
- Hi!
- Oh!

29:51.877 --> 29:53.966
Oh!

29:54.009 --> 29:55.184
Yeah.

29:55.228 --> 29:57.534
- Good. Just like... so busy.
- Yeah.

29:57.578 --> 29:59.058
Hi.

29:59.101 --> 30:01.712
We're doing a hard seltzer
right now. It's like, crazy.

30:04.193 --> 30:06.195
Yeah.

30:06.239 --> 30:07.849
This is my friend Nikisha
from college.

30:07.893 --> 30:08.676
- Hi.
- This is Meredith.

30:08.719 --> 30:11.070
So nice to meet you.

30:11.113 --> 30:12.811
Do you mind getting me a drink, babe?

30:12.854 --> 30:14.203
Yeah. What do you want?

30:14.247 --> 30:16.727
Um, something with Vida.
I need tequila.

30:19.774 --> 30:20.993
Yeah, hit it!

30:21.036 --> 30:22.908
Whoo-hoo!

30:24.300 --> 30:26.520
Hey, your oldest baby--
I gotta ask you.

30:26.563 --> 30:28.391
- Santa Barbara?
- Santa Barbara.

30:28.435 --> 30:29.958
She loves it? Tell her to go
to class, 'cause it's beautiful.

30:30.002 --> 30:31.742
Listen, she's going to class.

30:31.786 --> 30:32.918
She got straight A's
first quarter.

30:32.961 --> 30:36.095
Oh, Mom! Mom!
I know. Listen.

30:36.138 --> 30:36.922
- Mom!
- And she Facetimed me.

30:36.965 --> 30:39.489
- Mom!
- Yes, sir.

30:39.533 --> 30:41.883
Big Baby.

30:43.450 --> 30:45.234
- How you feeling?
- Good, good.

30:45.278 --> 30:46.583
We about to get stupid
up in here.

30:46.627 --> 30:48.759
Now tell me about Big Daddy.
Is he your friend?

30:48.803 --> 30:50.805
- Yeah!
- Is he gonna be my friend?

30:50.849 --> 30:52.067
Might be yours.

30:52.111 --> 30:54.635
I am a big fan.
I love your game.

30:54.678 --> 30:56.419
- You know who that is?
- Big Baby?

30:56.463 --> 30:59.118
You know who Glen Davis is, right?

30:59.161 --> 31:00.293
Correct.

31:00.336 --> 31:01.947
How tall are you?

31:01.990 --> 31:05.602
- Baby.
- He's a short 6'8".

31:05.646 --> 31:08.475
Yeah, short.
You're a short, stocky 6'8".

31:09.955 --> 31:11.739
The upgrade from Big Daddy
to Big Baby is like going

31:11.782 --> 31:14.307
from a Shirley Temple
to a Piña Colada.

31:14.350 --> 31:16.222
I heard you were the Big Easy.
Are you not...

31:16.265 --> 31:20.139
I heard you were the Big Easy.

31:20.182 --> 31:21.662
Anything to drink, sir?

31:21.705 --> 31:23.620
You know what? Could I do
a cranberry and orange juice?

31:23.664 --> 31:25.057
Oh, of course.

31:26.580 --> 31:29.931
Oh, yes, yes. Pop that booty.
Pop that booty. Pop.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.679
- Whitney.
- Nice to meet you.

31:38.722 --> 31:39.898
Nice to meet you.

31:39.941 --> 31:41.551
Did you put shimmer
on your ta-tas?

31:41.595 --> 31:44.293
- I did.
- They look good.

31:44.337 --> 31:46.339
I got a little shimmer going.

31:46.382 --> 31:48.080
Thanks for having this
for Sharrieff. It's amazing.

31:48.123 --> 31:49.646
It's so...

31:49.690 --> 31:50.952
Oh!

31:50.996 --> 31:54.303
So we're this...

31:55.739 --> 31:59.047
It's a good night,
and I'm just saying, like,

31:59.091 --> 32:00.701
I met with Lisa.

32:02.833 --> 32:04.400
And I haven't had the chance
to talk to you about it,

32:04.444 --> 32:06.837
and, like, I don't wanna
burden tonight with it.

32:06.881 --> 32:10.972
But the fact that you're here
is to me, like, maturity.

32:11.016 --> 32:13.018
I don't think it's a big deal.

32:13.061 --> 32:15.237
I think it's a huge deal.

32:15.281 --> 32:16.717
If anyone should be wallowing
and crying

32:16.760 --> 32:18.197
in the corner at home,
it's not me.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.503
I didn't do anything wrong.

32:20.547 --> 32:22.853
I love that Meredith
is a woman of principle,

32:22.897 --> 32:24.812
but on that same note, there's
a Mormon proverb that says,

32:24.855 --> 32:28.511
"Where much is given,
much is expected."

32:28.555 --> 32:30.818
So if you've given 10 years
to a friendship,

32:30.861 --> 32:32.646
you're expected to have
a conversation

32:32.689 --> 32:35.954
about a path to forgiveness.

32:35.997 --> 32:38.130
It is brave of you
to be here tonight.

32:38.173 --> 32:39.435
You can also just walk away
and say,

32:39.479 --> 32:41.089
"I don't have to be
around that."

32:41.133 --> 32:42.961
You had that option, you know?

32:44.788 --> 32:45.572
<i>Coming up...</i>

32:45.615 --> 32:49.010
Hey, Seth. How are you?

32:49.054 --> 32:50.185
Look, look, look, look.

32:51.404 --> 32:53.188
Why is this happening here?

32:59.368 --> 33:02.110
Uh, give me 50 on that hard 4, Randy.

33:03.764 --> 33:05.505
Hi, baby.

33:07.594 --> 33:09.422
So glad you're having
a good time. I'm so happy.

33:09.465 --> 33:11.467
- Man, I'm so--
- Enjoy yourself.

33:11.511 --> 33:12.468
- Oh, bless yourself.
- Enjoy yourself.

33:12.512 --> 33:13.730
I'm so happy.

33:13.774 --> 33:15.254
I'm happy you're having
a good time.

33:15.297 --> 33:16.516
- Man, Mama.
- You never relax.

33:16.559 --> 33:18.387
- I know, huh?
- All right, go, boy.

33:18.431 --> 33:19.693
- Do your thang.
- Come on, you wanna get

33:19.736 --> 33:22.087
a little something to sip on?
- Oh.

33:24.654 --> 33:27.222
- Everybody!
- Come on.

33:27.266 --> 33:28.441
- Whoo!
- Shh!

33:28.484 --> 33:31.270
- We need Jen to make a speech.
- Shh!

33:31.313 --> 33:34.229
Everybody, we need Jen to make

33:34.273 --> 33:36.492
a little toast
to the birthday boy.

33:36.536 --> 33:38.233
Coach doesn't really like

33:38.277 --> 33:39.539
celebrating his birthday
that much.

33:39.582 --> 33:41.236
I don't.

33:41.280 --> 33:45.371
But, you know, this year
was very special.

33:45.414 --> 33:48.809
It was important for me
to show you

33:48.852 --> 33:51.290
how much I love
and appreciate you.

33:51.333 --> 33:54.293
I know we've been through a lot.

33:54.336 --> 33:58.166
And, um...

33:58.210 --> 34:00.647
because of everything
we've been going through,

34:00.690 --> 34:03.693
it means more to me than ever

34:03.737 --> 34:06.957
in my life to have people
that I know...

34:07.001 --> 34:08.481
that really, truly love me

34:08.524 --> 34:10.091
and love our family.

34:10.135 --> 34:11.223
- We love you, Jen!
- MAN #2: We love you, baby!

34:14.356 --> 34:16.010
- That's right!
- Always.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.751
And to everybody that
has been there and just...

34:17.794 --> 34:20.710
thank you for being here
to wish Coach a happy birthday,

34:20.754 --> 34:23.191
because this birthday, I think,
means more to me

34:23.235 --> 34:25.802
than anything because we can
still be here together

34:25.846 --> 34:26.977
to celebrate it.

34:27.021 --> 34:28.631
I know that's right!

34:28.675 --> 34:30.416
Amen.

34:30.459 --> 34:32.983
And, Angie and Shawn,
thank you so much.

34:33.027 --> 34:35.247
Thank you for opening up
your home,

34:35.290 --> 34:37.727
and for celebrating with us.

34:37.771 --> 34:40.730
The one thing that can bring me
to tears almost instantly

34:40.774 --> 34:46.867
is thinking of life
without my wife by my side.

34:46.910 --> 34:50.653
That's hard to...
it's hard to stomach.

34:50.697 --> 34:51.567
Make a wish, baby.

35:17.419 --> 35:19.465
- Yeah.
- I'm doing good.

35:19.508 --> 35:21.989
Good to see you, man.

35:22.032 --> 35:24.470
- Are you in town long?
- This week,

35:24.513 --> 35:26.907
but, yeah. Yeah.

35:26.950 --> 35:31.085
Well, if you can break away,
let me know.

35:31.129 --> 35:34.088
Yeah. It's, uh...

35:38.179 --> 35:42.096
It... whatever our wives are--
I hope that's...

35:42.140 --> 35:42.966
Yes.

35:48.450 --> 35:49.669
Our relationship--

35:49.712 --> 35:51.105
I'm not accountable
for Meredith's behavior.

35:51.149 --> 35:54.674
I know you're not accountable
for Lisa's behavior.

35:54.717 --> 35:56.110
- I have to believe that...
- Yes.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.720
...'cause I know it's true
for me.

35:57.764 --> 36:01.594
Oh, for sure. For sure.
No, that'll never change.

36:01.637 --> 36:03.204
- Yeah.
- Never change at all.

36:03.248 --> 36:04.684
I do like your tie.

36:04.727 --> 36:07.861
Thank you, man.
You look sharp. Looking good.

36:07.904 --> 36:10.646
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

36:10.690 --> 36:13.562
<i>♪ Hit it, Rico, hit it, Rico</i>

36:13.606 --> 36:16.043
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!</i>

36:16.086 --> 36:18.698
<i>♪ Hit it, Rico, hit it, Rico</i>

36:18.741 --> 36:20.830
- Aah!
- Whoo!

36:24.051 --> 36:27.272
<i>-♪ Hit it, Rico, hit it Rico</i>
- Oh, there you go.

36:34.061 --> 36:37.195
You better slow down, baby!
You know you gotta slow down!

36:37.238 --> 36:38.935
Well, you do know that.

36:38.979 --> 36:40.241
- Hey.
- Hi! Oh, my gosh.

36:40.285 --> 36:42.896
What if I have a King?
What if I have a King?

36:42.939 --> 36:44.463
Yeah, a King for a Queen.
A King for a Queen.

36:44.506 --> 36:46.421
I love it.

36:46.465 --> 36:48.597
I'm gonna pinch you some chips.
How are you doing?

36:48.641 --> 36:50.991
- How's your night?
- Good. Oh, my gosh. Good.

36:51.034 --> 36:54.603
Are you gonna say anything
to Meredith or Seth?

36:54.647 --> 36:56.866
I don't think the time's right
right now.

36:58.041 --> 36:59.782
I just don't think
it's the right time.

36:59.826 --> 37:00.957
Time's not about that.
You know what I mean?

37:01.001 --> 37:02.220
- Yeah.
- You can save that for another.

37:02.263 --> 37:04.134
Especially with everything
Jen has going on,

37:04.178 --> 37:06.354
I really just wanna be here
for her.

37:06.398 --> 37:09.183
It's, like, hard now.
It's about to get harder.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.793
Well, that's the thing.
That's what we keep hearing,

37:10.837 --> 37:14.275
is that she just really needs us
to be there for her, so...

37:14.319 --> 37:16.277
In that moment,
I was kinda thinking,

37:16.321 --> 37:18.366
why don't we hurry
and take a quick trip

37:18.410 --> 37:19.802
before she goes to New York?

37:19.846 --> 37:22.065
We need to.
Where should we go?

37:22.109 --> 37:23.719
- Build on that good energy.
- Where should we go?

37:23.763 --> 37:25.417
Somewhere close,
not a long flight.

37:25.460 --> 37:28.333
- Somewhere we can just, like--
- Somewhere warm, sunshine.

37:28.376 --> 37:29.986
I was thinking Arizona.

37:30.030 --> 37:31.814
- Oh, my God. I'm in. Let's go.
- All right.

37:31.858 --> 37:33.076
I will take care of everything.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.078
I'll take care
of all the details.

37:35.122 --> 37:36.210
- Should we put a bet in?
- Okay.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.256
- Okay, girl.
- I'm gonna go all in.

37:38.299 --> 37:40.780
Oh! Let's go all in!

37:40.823 --> 37:42.303
I'm going all in
on the girls' trip.

37:42.347 --> 37:43.957
You better.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.438
14, 16.

37:46.481 --> 37:47.526
- Bet 5 more.
- I'm gonna hit.

37:47.569 --> 37:48.570
- The book says hit.
- Getting...

37:48.614 --> 37:52.008
Oh!

37:52.052 --> 37:53.793
There's no hope
for our friends!

37:53.836 --> 37:55.360
No hope.

37:56.752 --> 37:58.450
Look at her.

37:58.493 --> 37:59.755
- Yes.
- Mom, don't be trying

37:59.799 --> 38:01.104
to be mean.
No young tender for you, Mom.

38:04.586 --> 38:06.762
It looks good, right?

38:08.677 --> 38:10.723
Yes. The best thing is
the octopus.

38:10.766 --> 38:12.986
- Oh, my God.
- It's so good.

38:13.029 --> 38:14.683
- Hey.
- Hi. How are you?

38:14.727 --> 38:16.294
I wanted to say hi.

38:18.208 --> 38:21.647
Okay. Um...

38:21.690 --> 38:22.822
At some point,
I wanna talk to you

38:22.865 --> 38:24.606
if you're open to it.

38:24.650 --> 38:25.999
- Sure.
- Not tonight.

38:26.042 --> 38:29.307
You know what? You've had
two months nearly now

38:29.350 --> 38:31.961
to reach out to me and tell me
you wanna talk to me.

38:32.005 --> 38:33.746
Well, I just want you to know
I love you

38:33.789 --> 38:35.182
and I'm really, really sorry.

38:35.225 --> 38:36.705
Leave me alone.

38:36.749 --> 38:38.620
Look. Look, look. Look.

38:40.622 --> 38:42.711
Okay.

38:42.755 --> 38:46.106
Hey, Seth. How are you?

38:46.149 --> 38:47.847
- Good. How are you?
- Can I hug you?

38:47.890 --> 38:51.241
- Is it okay? You don't have to.
- No, I don't...

38:51.285 --> 38:52.852
That's huge.

38:52.895 --> 38:54.723
It was crazy, so I don't still--
trying to understand it.

38:54.767 --> 38:57.422
Yeah. I'm sorry.

38:57.465 --> 38:59.598
Meredith was devastated.

38:59.641 --> 39:01.774
I know. I know.

39:01.817 --> 39:04.907
- It was hard on me.
- Yeah, I know.

39:04.951 --> 39:08.433
You made some comments about me
that I couldn't believe either.

39:08.476 --> 39:09.825
I regret all of it.

39:09.869 --> 39:11.349
Seth, I can't even believe
I said those things.

39:11.392 --> 39:13.046
I don't feel that way
about Meredith.

39:13.089 --> 39:16.136
I don't feel that way about you.
Like, I don't. Like, I don't.

39:28.409 --> 39:30.237
Seth, I can't even believe
I said those things.

39:30.280 --> 39:31.891
I don't feel that way
about Meredith.

39:31.934 --> 39:33.066
I don't feel that way
about you.

39:33.109 --> 39:35.416
Like, I don't. Like, I don't.

39:35.460 --> 39:38.811
Seth is talking to Lisa
right now.

39:38.854 --> 39:42.902
Whatever, you know?

39:42.945 --> 39:45.861
What... we were surprised
by that, that, like...

39:45.905 --> 39:48.951
- I know.
- ...wasn't the Lisa we know.

39:48.995 --> 39:52.085
- Yeah.
- That behavior was... so hurtful.

39:52.128 --> 39:53.956
I hope you can
understand that, like,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.698
I literally haven't been able
to sleep.

39:56.742 --> 39:58.004
Like, it's been weighing on me,

39:58.047 --> 39:59.222
and, like, John's, like,
"It's gonna be okay."

39:59.266 --> 40:03.096
But, like,
it doesn't feel like it.

40:03.139 --> 40:05.272
Why is this happening here?
She's had a month.

40:05.315 --> 40:06.926
She could've texted me.
She could've texted Seth.

40:06.969 --> 40:08.580
She could've texted my children.

40:08.623 --> 40:10.277
She hasn't said anything, right?

40:10.320 --> 40:11.931
No! Like, if you wanna talk
to him, then tell us,

40:11.974 --> 40:13.541
but why are you attacking
my husband right now

40:13.585 --> 40:17.066
while we're trying to have fun
and celebrate your husband?

40:18.372 --> 40:22.158
Literally, Seth, it was like
a blind, like, rant.

40:22.202 --> 40:27.076
Have you--You know what the root
of that was?

40:27.120 --> 40:29.296
It was never before that trip.

40:29.339 --> 40:30.689
Like, I'd never thought
those things.

40:30.732 --> 40:32.517
I don't even think
those things now, but, like,

40:32.560 --> 40:34.388
on the van on the way down,
everyone's like,

40:34.432 --> 40:36.303
"She's not your friend.
Like, that's not your friend,"

40:36.346 --> 40:39.698
and then, like, just hearing it
over and over again,

40:39.741 --> 40:41.003
did that make sense?

40:41.047 --> 40:42.831
Not--None of it makes
sense to me.

40:42.875 --> 40:46.574
Like, to--to get to where
you got to,

40:46.618 --> 40:50.622
I can never imagine myself
saying something like that

40:50.665 --> 40:51.971
about someone we love.

40:52.014 --> 40:54.756
And, Seth, I understand that.

40:54.800 --> 40:58.456
Like, I don't even remember
saying those things.

40:58.499 --> 41:01.502
And I-I did feel hurt.

41:01.546 --> 41:04.331
Like, I understand Meredith
was hurting. I was hurting, too.

41:04.374 --> 41:07.247
I'm not--I'm not making excuses,

41:07.290 --> 41:10.511
but I was coming
from a place of hurt.

41:10.555 --> 41:14.384
- It just seemed so hateful.
- It was. It was hurt.

41:14.428 --> 41:16.517
I'm human, and I was hurting.
It wasn't hate.

41:16.561 --> 41:17.997
It was hurt.
I'm one of five girls,

41:18.040 --> 41:20.521
and, like, I'm a girls' girl.

41:20.565 --> 41:24.482
I have four sisters that I'm,
like, very responsible for,

41:24.525 --> 41:26.745
and, like, I have my stuff
going on, too, Seth.

41:26.788 --> 41:28.660
Nobody knows what goes on
for me.

41:28.703 --> 41:31.445
Nobody asked me,
and then I'm trying to, like,

41:31.489 --> 41:32.838
be there for others.

41:32.881 --> 41:35.449
I've never talked badly
about Meredith to anyone.

41:37.973 --> 41:39.758
There's not one person
in this friend group

41:39.801 --> 41:42.456
that can say I've ever said
anything about her.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.805
The rant was...

41:43.849 --> 41:46.895
I know, but I thought I was
in a private space

41:46.939 --> 41:50.290
just, like, hurting.

41:50.333 --> 41:52.205
It wasn't meant for anybody else
to hear.

41:52.248 --> 41:59.125
And, like, I don't expect you
to, like, like, forgive.

41:59.168 --> 42:02.737
She's hurt more than me,
and rightfully so.

42:02.781 --> 42:06.872
It's hard right now, so, like,
we'll just keep moving forward.

42:06.915 --> 42:08.874
Thanks for listening to me.

42:12.051 --> 42:13.705
Do I have a problem
saying I'm sorry? Never.

42:13.748 --> 42:16.229
Do I have a problem
taking accountability

42:16.272 --> 42:18.492
for my actions or my words?
Not at all.

42:18.536 --> 42:20.407
But at some point,
if it's not being heard,

42:20.450 --> 42:23.279
and the apology
isn't being accepted,

42:23.323 --> 42:26.369
there's nothing more I can do.
I have to move on.

42:26.413 --> 42:30.417
- Do you care if we leave?
- You okay?

42:30.460 --> 42:33.246
- What was she saying?
- I wasn't ready for it.

42:33.289 --> 42:36.118
- Why did you even go there?
- What was I gonna do?

42:36.162 --> 42:38.556
I would say,
"It's not the time and place."

42:40.209 --> 42:44.257
The bad news is she doesn't--
She seems to be excusing it

42:44.300 --> 42:46.825
and not taking accountability
for it.

42:46.868 --> 42:50.393
Is it an apology when
you're excusing the behavior?

42:50.437 --> 42:51.525
No.

42:51.569 --> 42:53.048
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you, guys.

42:53.092 --> 42:55.050
Love you. Bye. Good night.

43:01.709 --> 43:04.756
<i>Next time on "The Real
Housewives of Salt Lake City"...</i>

43:04.799 --> 43:07.454
We're gonna plan a little party.
It's gonna be called

43:07.497 --> 43:09.674
the "Garbage Trash Whore"
lingerie party.

43:09.717 --> 43:11.545
- That's not good.
- I'll just say G.T.W.

43:11.589 --> 43:13.155
G.T.W.

43:15.288 --> 43:16.942
I love Arizona in the winter.

43:16.985 --> 43:19.118
What's up?!

43:19.161 --> 43:20.598
I missed you!

43:21.903 --> 43:25.080
No.

43:25.124 --> 43:27.648
I love you both,
and maybe it's at the point now

43:27.692 --> 43:29.084
where there can
be a conversation,

43:29.128 --> 43:30.303
and she can hear you.

43:30.346 --> 43:32.566
Have you talked to her about it?

43:32.610 --> 43:34.481
Yes.

43:34.524 --> 43:36.222
Meredith brought up rumors
about Lisa having--

43:36.265 --> 43:38.137
- About what?
- Affairs.

43:38.180 --> 43:39.791
I just heard that she was,
you know,

43:39.834 --> 43:43.446
doing favors to help get places
to pick up Vida Tequila.

43:43.490 --> 43:46.275
You have to swallow it
and bury it.

43:46.319 --> 43:48.321
We have a shaman coming.

43:48.364 --> 43:50.802
She recommended not drinking.

43:50.845 --> 43:52.194
Yeah.

43:52.238 --> 43:55.415
- How are we feeling?
- I had some anxiety.

43:55.458 --> 43:58.461
Well, I used to feel like
I was a safe space for you.

43:58.505 --> 44:00.159
You are not a safe space, Lisa.

44:01.943 --> 44:04.293
I mean, I'm not gonna lie.
