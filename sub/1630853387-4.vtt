WEBVTT

00:25.359 --> 00:28.570
Keep her safe. Protect us.

01:38.307 --> 01:39.808
Are you still not ready?

01:41.476 --> 01:42.477
What is it?

01:43.395 --> 01:44.730
Nothing. It's just--

01:46.523 --> 01:47.649
A party.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.695
Reminds me of the old days. Of London.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.492
Michael can't hurt you now.

01:59.912 --> 02:01.496
You just be yourself tonight.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.902
Come on. We're going to be late.

02:36.782 --> 02:39.535
I'm not coming. You go without me.

02:40.869 --> 02:44.456
But Cora's our friend.
She'd be so disappointed.

02:47.251 --> 02:49.086
Go on. You need to change.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.171
Charles will be here soon.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.521
Can I take these to the goats?

03:49.605 --> 03:52.357
Not now. We're celebrating.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.776
With a party for your mother.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.073
They're for the guests.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.283
What am I?

04:05.329 --> 04:06.413
Is it too much?

04:07.247 --> 04:08.790
It's perfect.

04:11.710 --> 04:12.711
And me?

04:13.754 --> 04:16.380
You've made such an effort. Thank you.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.051
If only we were at Simpson's.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.303
I don't think they'd approve
of my footwear.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.725
Then I'm glad we're here.

04:38.946 --> 04:39.947
That's better.

04:41.657 --> 04:42.658
Is it?

05:12.437 --> 05:13.856
I bought you a present.

05:20.821 --> 05:21.947
Open it.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.213
Well, this is…

05:39.548 --> 05:40.632
This is too much.

05:40.716 --> 05:41.884
I should hope so.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.554
Try it on.

05:46.638 --> 05:47.973
Luke, I…

05:48.557 --> 05:52.436
- I will, of course. Later. I…
- I thought you might wear it tonight.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.816
It won't suit the neckline of the dress.

05:59.443 --> 06:00.861
Keep it safe for me.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.573
I really can't thank you enough.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.493
Happy birthday.

06:10.412 --> 06:11.538
They're here.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.336
Hadn't you better change? I'll get it.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.758
- Hello.
- Hello.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.384
Please come in, everyone.

06:24.468 --> 06:27.888
Good evening. We bring wine
and oranges from Harrods.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.139
Thank you.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.683
Please come through.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.855
- Cora.
- Stella. How good to see you.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.691
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

06:40.484 --> 06:42.194
Please, make yourself at home.

06:42.277 --> 06:45.531
We met at Michael's funeral. Luke Garrett.

06:46.657 --> 06:49.493
Yes. I read about your work.

06:49.576 --> 06:52.538
Charles Ambrose, MP for Limehouse.
Now, where is she?

06:53.163 --> 06:54.331
There you are.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.333
Charles. Thank you for coming.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.168
My pleasure.

06:59.461 --> 07:02.214
- Now point me to the wine.
- There.

07:03.632 --> 07:04.842
Children.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.093
Hello, Will.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.720
- How are you?
- Cora.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.852
Will. Say something.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.732
Doesn't Cora look lovely?

07:22.067 --> 07:24.444
You certainly look… clean.

07:27.531 --> 07:28.699
Please excuse him.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.242
No, not at all.

07:30.826 --> 07:32.286
Who knew such treasure

07:32.369 --> 07:34.872
was buried under all that mud?

07:35.706 --> 07:37.958
- Can I try your piano?
- Of course you can.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.962
Jo seems much better.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.715
Dr. Garrett, I owe you an apology.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.510
I was rude when we met, and I'm sorry.

07:48.594 --> 07:49.970
You helped my daughter.

07:50.554 --> 07:53.182
- I shouldn't have lost my temper.
- Don't mention it.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.893
Cora and I,
we didn't see any harm, did we?

07:55.976 --> 07:58.937
I'd put her under hypnosis
just the night before.

07:59.021 --> 08:02.691
- She invited me to, of course.
- I did.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.820
I can't imagine you
doing anything you didn't want to.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.408
I must take a drink to Stella.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.914
- Thank you, John.
- Drinking water, are we?

08:20.334 --> 08:22.085
Think she wanted to impress you.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.922
Well, it worked. She's very talented.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.675
Cora says you're a genius.

08:30.052 --> 08:31.053
Are you?

08:31.762 --> 08:33.054
So they say.

08:33.804 --> 08:36.600
My recent surgical breakthrough
caused quite a stir.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.605
Tell me, have you any interest
in medical science?

08:43.398 --> 08:46.276
Human beings gutted like hens.

08:48.612 --> 08:49.988
It's the future.

08:50.572 --> 08:53.325
Dr. Garrett, while I consider
my faith an enlightened one--

08:53.408 --> 08:55.202
You privilege belief over evidence.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.663
It's not that simple.

08:58.705 --> 08:59.706
Oh, no?

09:01.458 --> 09:05.254
I think the Essex Serpent
has sunk its claws into you too.

09:05.838 --> 09:10.551
Imagine it, even now,
crawling up onto the marsh.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.637
Perhaps I will have some wine.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.265
Do. I'm dying to see how this is done.

09:18.642 --> 09:20.185
More friends. Excuse me.

09:24.857 --> 09:28.026
Oh, no, thank you. Password?

09:31.530 --> 09:33.490
You bloody Harold…

09:34.074 --> 09:35.617
Lovely to see you!

09:35.701 --> 09:37.494
Nice to see you. Come in!

09:39.121 --> 09:41.540
Can't believe you made it.

09:43.625 --> 09:46.086
Right. Where is the birthday girl?

09:46.170 --> 09:49.464
See! I told you
I'd throw you a decent party.

09:49.548 --> 09:51.258
- Spencer. Hi.
- Happy birthday.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.342
Thank you.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.970
Happy Birthday!

10:00.893 --> 10:03.562
- Martha. You look lovely.
- You do too.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.106
We should nab Ambrose.

10:07.608 --> 10:08.901
He must be in the kitchen.

10:10.485 --> 10:11.987
Do you mind? Of course.

10:14.323 --> 10:17.326
Is Cora any closer
to finding her serpent?

10:17.409 --> 10:21.288
Well, I observed her halfway
around Essex looking for dinosaur bones.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.456
No.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.000
Charles Ambrose?

10:25.626 --> 10:27.002
George Spencer.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.963
Have you had a chance to read his letter?

10:30.047 --> 10:32.174
Indeed. Good to meet you.

10:32.758 --> 10:35.135
How did you persuade him
to join your cause?

10:35.636 --> 10:38.096
Well, perhaps the truth was enough.

10:38.180 --> 10:41.016
Squalid tenements,
families living five to a room.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.061
I thought this was a party.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.147
- You know this woman's a raving communist?
- I wouldn't say that.

10:47.231 --> 10:48.440
I would.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.609
But a rather charming one.

10:51.443 --> 10:55.405
Have you been to Ratcliffe, sir?
Seen the conditions firsthand?

10:55.906 --> 10:58.325
I haven't.

10:58.408 --> 11:02.538
But I have seen the Royal Commission
and read Dilke's recommendation.

11:02.621 --> 11:05.874
- Which have had very little impact.
- I have to take your word on that.

11:05.958 --> 11:07.459
Why not let Martha show you around?

11:07.543 --> 11:09.878
She could show you
how poor housing affects people's health.

11:09.962 --> 11:11.755
Martha's a doctor now, is she?

11:12.130 --> 11:14.550
Well, of course not.
It'll be far better if you joined them.

11:14.633 --> 11:17.845
I would love to introduce you
to the young man whose life I saved.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.138
Excellent. We'll all go together.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.158
Father?

11:42.286 --> 11:45.789
Did the serpent take Gracie for her sins?

11:57.342 --> 11:58.719
She's gone.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.936
And there's nothing we can do now.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.616
What if I'm a sinner too?

12:36.215 --> 12:37.424
Talk to Will.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.433
Ask for forgiveness.

13:09.790 --> 13:10.791
Father?

13:14.211 --> 13:15.212
Will?

13:42.531 --> 13:43.574
Forgive me.

13:46.577 --> 13:48.120
Forgive me.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.418
What are you doing here?

13:58.422 --> 13:59.548
What have you done?

14:00.299 --> 14:03.260
Nothing. I just need to talk to Will.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.597
Well, you can talk to me.

14:12.311 --> 14:13.312
Where is he?

14:17.274 --> 14:19.693
Dancing with the devil, for all I know.

14:23.572 --> 14:25.949
If you've sinned,
the serpent will take you.

14:46.637 --> 14:49.139
Hello, down there. Are you coming out?

14:52.726 --> 14:54.061
I spotted your collection.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.654
I've found hundreds. These are the best.

15:04.780 --> 15:08.367
We share a gift of finding beauty
no one else sees, Frankie.

15:10.285 --> 15:13.247
- You're a public speaker. Say something.
- Of course.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.290
Yes, indeed. No, no. Please, tell me.

15:17.793 --> 15:18.836
Are we dancing?

15:18.919 --> 15:20.838
-'Course we are!
- Yes!

15:20.921 --> 15:23.006
Patrick. William.

15:23.507 --> 15:25.676
Okay. Right, here we are.

15:25.759 --> 15:28.804
Go on, get this thing rolled up.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.203
Hey, everybody!

16:06.008 --> 16:07.342
Yes!

17:06.818 --> 17:07.819
Will?

17:09.570 --> 17:11.073
Is anyone there?

17:26.672 --> 17:29.466
Water? It's cold.

17:36.598 --> 17:38.517
Aquamarine is named for seawater.

17:40.143 --> 17:43.480
A stone to calm the waves
and keep sailors safe.

17:46.650 --> 17:50.445
I feel I'm more blue than any other color.

18:08.297 --> 18:12.176
My hospital tests
for respiratory diseases.

18:14.636 --> 18:18.849
You've made a brave show of things,
but you are very ill.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.143
Stella?

18:23.770 --> 18:25.022
I think you know.

18:27.858 --> 18:29.943
You must come to London
as soon as you can.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.487
I'll see you without an appointment.

18:39.077 --> 18:40.078
Good.

18:41.747 --> 18:43.874
- Garrett?
- Life's for the living.

18:48.545 --> 18:49.796
Garrett?

19:00.390 --> 19:01.475
This is lovely.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.106
Really?

19:14.488 --> 19:16.698
I want to see my husband dance.

19:22.162 --> 19:23.247
Stella.

19:25.958 --> 19:27.668
Have you really the energy?

19:27.751 --> 19:31.380
Since I'm too tired to dance,
will my friend take my place?

19:36.009 --> 19:39.012
I'm sorry. I'm all danced out.

19:39.096 --> 19:41.348
And I have no music in me, as you know.

19:41.431 --> 19:43.141
It would give me such pleasure.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.995
- I don't know the steps.
- Just follow me.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.249
Waist.

20:10.085 --> 20:13.881
One, two, three. One, two, three. One…

20:14.298 --> 20:15.340
Sorry.

21:39.216 --> 21:40.217
Will.

21:41.927 --> 21:42.886
John.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.223
I think it's time to go home.

21:49.184 --> 21:50.561
- Charles?
- Yes?

21:52.604 --> 21:54.314
- We'll speak soon.
- Yes.

21:54.815 --> 21:57.401
- I should be heading off.
- Yeah. Lovely to see you.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.653
- Very enjoyable.
- Yes, always.

22:19.089 --> 22:20.174
Father?

23:31.286 --> 23:33.497
You don't see that in London.

23:34.289 --> 23:36.166
It's called the night shining.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.418
What causes it?

23:38.502 --> 23:41.755
Some say moisture. Some say
it's ash from Krakatoa.

23:46.093 --> 23:48.053
It's like the whole world is blue.

23:56.186 --> 23:57.896
Look after each other, won't you?

24:00.941 --> 24:02.025
Good night, Charles.

24:07.823 --> 24:08.991
Frankie's in bed.

24:10.367 --> 24:11.618
Leave that till the morning.

24:12.452 --> 24:13.787
I just want to do it now.

24:17.416 --> 24:18.584
Jo's coat.

24:19.376 --> 24:20.377
What?

24:21.378 --> 24:22.671
Well, she'll need it.

24:25.299 --> 24:26.300
Right now?

24:28.343 --> 24:32.055
Well, I need the air. I need to walk.

24:58.248 --> 24:59.416
Sleep well.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.263
Leave the window open.

25:17.100 --> 25:18.268
You'll catch a chill.

25:45.462 --> 25:47.297
I knew she'd never sleep after that.

25:47.381 --> 25:49.049
Did you see Stella's face?

25:54.972 --> 25:57.599
Well,
it isn't like I didn't see it coming.

25:57.683 --> 26:01.478
I mean, every day his name comes up.
Every bloody day.

26:01.562 --> 26:03.146
Twice on Sundays.

26:06.984 --> 26:10.362
A vicar. For God's sake, Martha.

26:10.445 --> 26:13.323
- Stuck out in the marshes.
- Terrified by change,

26:13.407 --> 26:16.451
- paralyzed by possibility.
- And he's no dancer.

26:16.535 --> 26:17.744
Thank you.

26:19.496 --> 26:22.082
So what could she possibly see in him?
What future can there be?

26:23.876 --> 26:25.169
She's collecting him.

26:26.545 --> 26:32.509
She wants to put him in a little glass jar
and then label his parts in Latin.

26:33.427 --> 26:34.595
His parts?

26:36.555 --> 26:39.808
Very small jar, I suspect. Microscope…

26:45.606 --> 26:49.151
God, I'm beginning to think
I don't understand women at all.

27:02.039 --> 27:03.999
Let's see.

27:16.970 --> 27:18.680
Dance with me, vicar.

27:21.266 --> 27:23.185
I don't know the steps.

27:23.268 --> 27:24.937
I can teach you.

27:25.020 --> 27:28.357
- Perhaps I could read you a sermon?
- Oh, yes, vicar!

27:28.440 --> 27:30.067
Read me the Gospel.

27:30.150 --> 27:35.531
I want Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

27:35.614 --> 27:36.865
All at once?

27:37.616 --> 27:41.745
Of course. I'm Cora Seaborne.
I can have whoever I want.

27:44.414 --> 27:46.625
What's so hard to understand about that?

27:48.710 --> 27:49.878
Nothing.

27:58.428 --> 27:59.471
Come with me.

28:01.598 --> 28:02.641
Come up with me.

28:12.693 --> 28:14.486
Do you know how women work?

28:14.570 --> 28:15.904
Of course, I'm a doctor.

28:19.199 --> 28:20.200
Yeah!

28:36.383 --> 28:37.509
What?

28:38.594 --> 28:40.262
You're thinking of her, aren't you?

28:41.430 --> 28:42.598
No.

28:45.642 --> 28:47.603
Don't worry. So am I.

29:57.631 --> 29:58.757
Who's there?

29:59.508 --> 30:01.051
I brought scraps.

30:03.762 --> 30:05.430
For the goats.

30:05.973 --> 30:07.349
My friend.

30:12.229 --> 30:13.480
What are you doing?

30:15.190 --> 30:17.776
Why are you there on the ground?

30:18.610 --> 30:19.611
Am I?

30:25.993 --> 30:27.744
It smells like death.

30:32.624 --> 30:34.001
It's out there.

30:36.545 --> 30:38.255
Crushing me.

30:41.175 --> 30:42.384
My heart.

30:46.930 --> 30:49.141
The water's black.

30:52.102 --> 30:55.689
But look, the sky is blue.

30:59.401 --> 31:02.404
The whole universe.

31:04.990 --> 31:06.450
Alive.

31:07.534 --> 31:08.744
And me,

31:10.621 --> 31:12.247
a part of it.

32:32.911 --> 32:34.288
I feel half dead.

32:40.294 --> 32:44.923
You'll want eggs with salt
and a glass of cold beer.

32:46.884 --> 32:48.760
Is that your advice as a doctor?

32:50.345 --> 32:51.638
As a drinker.

32:58.854 --> 33:00.564
I'll miss my train.

33:01.940 --> 33:03.525
You're not leaving because of--

33:04.526 --> 33:08.614
I've misread a lot of things recently,
but I think we understand each other.

33:15.370 --> 33:19.082
Whatever I said last night,
Cora's my friend.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.585
And Spencer, mine.

35:03.270 --> 35:07.024
Luke's gone.
I saw him heading for the station.

35:10.235 --> 35:11.570
Did you not sleep?

35:13.947 --> 35:15.282
I walked all night.

35:29.505 --> 35:31.340
I've made such a mess.

35:42.684 --> 35:44.102
You've got a letter.

36:01.328 --> 36:02.329
Who's it from?

36:03.413 --> 36:04.790
My new friend, Sali.

36:06.333 --> 36:09.878
I must tell her about Ambrose.
There's so much to do.

36:14.174 --> 36:16.009
So, you'll want to go back to London?

36:16.885 --> 36:18.762
As soon as you could spare me.

37:02.181 --> 37:04.766
Naomi, breakfast!

37:30.626 --> 37:33.504
Naomi. Naomi!

37:38.383 --> 37:39.510
Naomi!

37:43.180 --> 37:44.431
Naomi!

38:19.591 --> 38:20.592
Frankie?

38:23.303 --> 38:25.848
Did you go out walking last night?

38:26.431 --> 38:29.476
After the party, were you at the beach?

38:32.271 --> 38:37.734
I woke up, and the sky was light.
Thought it was morning.

38:37.818 --> 38:41.113
You mustn't go out at night by yourself.
What if you got hurt?

38:41.613 --> 38:43.991
I wasn't by myself. Cracknell was there.

38:45.242 --> 38:46.285
And what happened?

38:46.869 --> 38:47.995
Nothing.

38:52.541 --> 38:53.917
We were looking at the sky.

38:54.626 --> 38:57.796
The tide was coming in, and then he died.

39:00.591 --> 39:02.176
What did you say?

39:03.177 --> 39:04.761
He died.

39:05.429 --> 39:07.598
How can you say that's nothing?

39:10.225 --> 39:15.105
After a while, it got cold,
so I came home to bed.

39:15.189 --> 39:16.815
Was that wrong?

39:20.027 --> 39:21.904
For heaven's sake, Frankie.

39:23.614 --> 39:25.115
Why didn't you tell me?

39:25.824 --> 39:28.243
How could I? You weren't there.

39:45.344 --> 39:47.054
Naomi!

40:23.382 --> 40:24.675
Lord, have mercy.

40:26.718 --> 40:27.719
Will?

40:35.686 --> 40:36.728
Was it a bad dream?

40:47.364 --> 40:48.866
I need to talk to you.

40:51.660 --> 40:53.328
Last night at the party--

40:54.371 --> 40:56.415
Open up! Open up!

40:56.498 --> 40:58.166
We'll talk, all right?

40:59.835 --> 41:01.170
The devil's loose in Aldwinter.

41:01.253 --> 41:03.463
- What?
- The serpent's struck again.

41:03.547 --> 41:05.174
Cracknell's body's on the beach.

41:09.052 --> 41:11.638
- Think he died of shock?
- No, his neck is snapped.

41:12.890 --> 41:14.474
It must have been the serpent.

41:15.392 --> 41:16.685
Everyone calm down. Calm down.

41:16.768 --> 41:20.063
I told you. I kept telling you we were
in danger, but you wouldn't listen.

41:20.147 --> 41:22.274
Has anyone seen my Naomi?

41:22.357 --> 41:24.276
She's not home, not slept in her bed.

41:24.359 --> 41:26.486
She's been taken.
She must have been taken.

41:26.570 --> 41:27.946
I said calm down.

41:28.030 --> 41:30.157
- When was the last time you saw her?
- Dinner time.

41:30.240 --> 41:32.117
I saw her in church after that
looking for you.

41:32.201 --> 41:33.952
- Matthew, don't.
- Where were you?

41:34.036 --> 41:37.706
- Please. A friend of ours has died.
- Friend? Whose friend? Not mine.

41:37.789 --> 41:39.499
And what about the serpent?

41:39.583 --> 41:42.294
- Yeah.
- There is no serpent.

41:42.377 --> 41:44.630
But it's been here, right here,
where you're standing now.

41:44.713 --> 41:46.882
- Yeah.
- It's attracted by our sin.

41:46.965 --> 41:48.258
- It's feeding off it.
- Matthew.

41:48.342 --> 41:50.594
First Gracie, now this godless man.

41:50.677 --> 41:52.137
Judgment is upon us.

41:52.221 --> 41:55.474
We must open up our eyes
to the depths of our sins and repent.

41:57.601 --> 41:59.269
Cora. Cora, wait.

41:59.353 --> 42:01.230
- Has the body been examined?
- Get back. Get back.

42:01.313 --> 42:02.856
- Is Dr. Garrett still here?
- No.

42:02.940 --> 42:05.234
He must have fallen. Been concussed.

42:05.317 --> 42:06.944
How could you know?

42:07.027 --> 42:09.488
But look with your own eyes.
He had some kind of accident.

42:10.155 --> 42:11.740
You were there when we found Gracie.

42:12.699 --> 42:13.700
Crouched by her side,

42:13.784 --> 42:15.035
- just like you are now.
- Henry.

42:15.118 --> 42:17.037
- What of it?
- We must look to our scriptures.

42:17.120 --> 42:19.081
It was woman
that was tempted by the serpent.

42:19.164 --> 42:22.000
It was woman that ate the fruit
and tasted evil.

42:22.084 --> 42:23.669
Yeah. Yeah.

42:23.752 --> 42:25.170
No. No.

42:25.254 --> 42:27.047
Are you denying the Lord's word, Father?

42:27.130 --> 42:28.841
I won't use them for my own ends.

42:28.924 --> 42:31.009
Where were you last night, Mrs. Seaborne?

42:31.093 --> 42:33.637
At home, with friends. It was my birthday.

42:33.720 --> 42:36.974
- Making merry, as the devil did his work.
- Yeah! Yeah!

42:37.057 --> 42:38.225
No, Will was there.

42:38.308 --> 42:39.685
- You were with her?
- Tell them.

42:42.062 --> 42:45.607
Look, this has nothing to do
with Mrs. Seaborne. Clearly.

42:45.691 --> 42:47.568
- But I saw her son on the marshes.
- Jonah.

42:47.651 --> 42:49.653
My son was with me all night.

42:50.237 --> 42:51.864
- Will.
- See? She's lying.

42:51.947 --> 42:55.576
- She's lying! She's a witch!
- Wait, wait. Hang on.

42:55.659 --> 42:57.369
You brought the serpent here.

42:57.452 --> 42:58.662
And you put a spell on him.

42:58.745 --> 42:59.913
Stop it. Enough!

42:59.997 --> 43:02.541
You did. You and that half-wit child--

43:02.624 --> 43:03.959
Shame on you!

43:04.042 --> 43:06.086
Cora. Cora, leave now.

43:06.170 --> 43:07.504
No! I won't!

43:08.046 --> 43:10.090
- Go!
- What's that on her neck?

43:10.174 --> 43:13.927
She's marked. She's the devil.
It's the mark of the devil.

43:14.595 --> 43:17.306
Stop this! Stop it!

43:17.389 --> 43:18.640
Go.

43:22.311 --> 43:26.106
Carry Cracknell to the church.
I'll administer to him there.

43:26.190 --> 43:28.108
- I'm not touching him.
- Yeah, me neither.

43:36.950 --> 43:37.951
Cora!

43:47.586 --> 43:48.587
Cora!

43:55.344 --> 43:56.345
Cora!

43:58.847 --> 44:00.015
Cora, stop!

44:01.642 --> 44:02.643
Cora!

44:04.019 --> 44:05.229
Cora!

44:05.312 --> 44:08.232
- You have no right to order me away!
- They were out of control.

44:08.315 --> 44:10.275
- They're frightened.
- You let them accuse me.

44:10.359 --> 44:12.319
- You said nothing.
- I'm their pastor.

44:12.402 --> 44:14.780
So, you can't be my friend
and a man of God?

44:14.863 --> 44:17.658
I can't think clearly when I'm around you.

44:17.741 --> 44:19.076
- I lose my bearings.
- No.

44:19.159 --> 44:22.037
I won't be blamed
for their ignorance or your weakness.

44:22.120 --> 44:23.956
Love is not a weakness.

46:03.472 --> 46:05.849
What are you doing? Where are you going?

46:05.933 --> 46:07.643
We're all going back to London.

46:07.726 --> 46:09.061
- Because of Cracknell?
- No.

46:09.686 --> 46:11.021
- Because of the serpent?
- No.

46:13.106 --> 46:16.735
Please, just
go and help Martha downstairs.

46:25.702 --> 46:27.704
Lock your doors! Say your prayers!

46:42.427 --> 46:43.428
Pull!

46:43.971 --> 46:45.556
Bring her ashore, boys!

46:45.639 --> 46:47.683
- Bring her ashore!
- One, two, three.

46:47.766 --> 46:49.768
May God protect you.

46:55.649 --> 46:58.735
One, two, three. Pull.

47:06.285 --> 47:07.494
What are they doing?

47:07.578 --> 47:08.745
They're not going to sea anymore.

47:08.829 --> 47:11.582
- Because of the serpent?
- Shut up about the serpent.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.001
What are you doing?

47:14.793 --> 47:16.253
Protecting the village from sin.

47:16.336 --> 47:17.629
From your sin.

47:17.713 --> 47:20.507
She's done nothing wrong.
If anybody's sinned, it's you.

47:20.591 --> 47:21.925
Scaring people, threatening them!

47:22.009 --> 47:23.635
Please, just take Frankie.

47:25.137 --> 47:27.097
We're leaving. Isn't that enough for you?

47:27.181 --> 47:29.308
May God's judgment pass over you!
