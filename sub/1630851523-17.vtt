- Interesting.

- Not at all.

01:14.813 --> 01:16.380
I was merely trying
to supervise,

01:16.424 --> 01:18.469

Alexa?

Alexa, what's the temperature
outside today?

Right now, it's 62 degrees...

01:38.010 --> 01:39.664

'em out, huh?

01:39.708 --> 01:41.710
Ooh, ask it who had
the more comely ankles

01:41.753 --> 01:43.015
at Mamie Fish's cotillion,

01:43.059 --> 01:44.887
and we'll settle this one
once and for all.

01:44.930 --> 01:47.019
No, ask it to order frozen
pizzas from the supermarket.

01:47.063 --> 01:48.760
I doubt it can do that.

01:48.804 --> 01:50.022
Oh, actually, I think it can,

01:50.066 --> 01:51.241
but I don't have time for this
right now

01:51.285 --> 01:53.025

a ton to do

01:53.069 --> 01:56.507

guest arrives in one week!

01:56.551 --> 01:58.640
- You actually booked a guest?
- Oh, yeah!

01:58.683 --> 01:59.989
Hell yeah, we did.

02:00.032 --> 02:01.469
But we've got a bunch
of chores to do

02:01.512 --> 02:02.687
before they show up.
Huh, babe?

02:02.731 --> 02:04.776
Okay, all right.
Well, you clean the gunk

02:04.820 --> 02:07.301
out of the kitchen sink
and I will get

02:07.344 --> 02:08.998
the extra blankets
out of the attic.

02:09.041 --> 02:10.739
Why-why do I have
to clean the gunk?

02:10.782 --> 02:12.958
'Cause I pried that watch off

02:13.002 --> 02:15.265
of your ancestor's
rotting corpse.

02:15.309 --> 02:16.527
- That is true.
- Fair.

02:16.571 --> 02:17.528
That's a good point.
That was gross.

02:17.572 --> 02:18.529
Fine. You get to use that,

like, two more times.

Hey, losers.

02:49.865 --> 02:51.388
What a lovely surprise.

02:51.432 --> 02:53.173
Although isn't it a little
early for you to be up?

02:53.216 --> 02:54.130
It's only April.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.566
Right, as a teen ghost

02:55.610 --> 02:57.307
you usually sleep
for months on end.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.309
I know.
Some dumb Living woke me up.

02:59.353 --> 03:01.746
Hey, so I heard Sam and Jay
actually booked a guest?

03:01.790 --> 03:03.487
Hi, Trevor.

03:03.531 --> 03:04.967
I was wondering where you were.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.447
Hi, Stephanie. How are you?

03:06.490 --> 03:07.622
Hi. Did you miss me?

03:07.665 --> 03:08.840
Just the normal amount

03:08.884 --> 03:10.581
that an adult should miss
a teenager.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.714
- You know, I'm-
- I'm... technically, I'm 53.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.498
Yeah, but you're not.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.239
Well, we were born
the same year.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.806
This is not gonna happen.

03:17.849 --> 03:20.461
Not gonna happen. Just... Whatever.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.767
So, this new Living--
is it just the one guy?

03:22.811 --> 03:24.769
Oh, no. He's married
to Samantha.

03:24.813 --> 03:26.597
Get this: we can talk to her

03:26.641 --> 03:28.208
and she talks back.

03:28.251 --> 03:29.644
Sure she can, Flower.

03:29.687 --> 03:30.819
No, really, she does.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.212
Ah, I couldn't find it.

03:32.255 --> 03:33.604
And here she is.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.780
Samantha, you must
meet Stephanie.

03:35.824 --> 03:38.000
Oh, another one.
Why not?

03:38.043 --> 03:40.220
- Uh, hi, I'm Sam.
- Hey.

03:40.263 --> 03:41.699
Stephanie's a ghost
that lives in the attic

03:41.743 --> 03:42.831
and sleeps most of the year.

03:42.874 --> 03:44.267
I-I really like your dress.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.790
I died on my way to prom.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.401
Really sucked.
Chainsaw murder.

03:47.444 --> 03:49.751
- God, that's awful.
- Yeah.

03:49.794 --> 03:52.188
You know, I actually had
kind of a bad prom, too.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.799
Although now that
I say it out loud,

03:54.843 --> 03:57.149
- yours was definitely worse.
- You think?

03:57.193 --> 03:59.587
Oh, well, I'm gonna just, uh,
help Jay with some stuff,

03:59.630 --> 04:00.892
but it is nice to meet you,

04:00.936 --> 04:03.417
and I'm sure I'll see you
later on. Bye.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.027
Bye.

04:05.984 --> 04:08.422
That was awkward.
What is with that chick?

04:08.465 --> 04:11.076
Well, she's a little awkward,
but in the cutest way.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.600
Like, the way she wrinkles her
nose when she's uncomfortable--

04:12.643 --> 04:13.905
it's adorable.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.646
Wait, are you into her
or something?

04:15.690 --> 04:17.257
Oh, yeah.
Trevor's in love with Sam.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.607
Truth be told, we all love Sam.

04:19.650 --> 04:22.436
And you will, too.
You guys are the same.

04:22.479 --> 04:24.046
Except she can do
things, is alive,

04:24.089 --> 04:25.047
and Trevor has
a crush on her.

04:25.090 --> 04:25.700
But other than that,

04:25.743 --> 04:27.528
she's just like you.

04:27.571 --> 04:28.877
Hmm.

Oh, I swear.</i>

04:30.531 --> 04:32.097
Livings are so lazy
these days.

04:32.141 --> 04:34.099
Can't even be bothered
to put on a record.

04:34.143 --> 04:37.015

"Alexa, play jazz."

04:37.059 --> 04:39.235

04:39.279 --> 04:40.541

04:42.020 --> 04:43.500

04:43.544 --> 04:45.937
Alexa, who invented popcorn?

04:46.764 --> 04:51.203
Alexa, will there be season two
of <i>It's Getting Hot in Here?</i>

04:52.248 --> 04:54.816
Alexa, what day of
the week is it?

04:54.859 --> 04:56.948
Today is Thursday, April 7.

04:56.992 --> 04:58.689
Whoa.

04:59.995 --> 05:01.997
I am a god.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.916
Whew. Yeah, I know
it's a lot of work,

05:07.959 --> 05:09.831
but I'm telling you,
I think Josh and Leeanne

05:09.874 --> 05:11.354
are really gonna appreciate it.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.095
- Who?
- Josh and Leeanne.

05:13.138 --> 05:14.357
They're the couple
that booked the room.

05:14.401 --> 05:15.619
They're from Erie, Pennsylvania,

05:15.663 --> 05:16.751
and they're coming out
to celebrate

05:16.794 --> 05:18.622
their 20th wedding anniversary.

05:18.666 --> 05:19.971
Aw, that's so sweet.

05:20.015 --> 05:21.538
Yeah, it was actually
a few months ago,

05:21.582 --> 05:23.671
but then, you know,
Josh got LASIK,

05:23.714 --> 05:26.064
and then he had his dental
practice, and then Leeanne was

05:26.108 --> 05:27.631
working with those
rescue animals. It was really

05:27.675 --> 05:29.067
the only free weekend
they could get.

05:29.111 --> 05:30.982
Have you been stalking
their social media?

05:31.026 --> 05:32.984
Yes. I went down a rabbit hole.

05:33.028 --> 05:36.118
I know things about Josh
that Leeanne doesn't know.

05:51.742 --> 05:53.309
Well, that's not possible.

a great development.

still here?

06:07.018 --> 06:09.543

- That's you described me?
- Hmm?

06:09.586 --> 06:10.674
No. No, no.

06:10.718 --> 06:12.676
"Creepy" is, like,
a word Jay chose.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.330
I have an idea, everyone.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.332
Since I never got to go
to my own prom,

06:16.376 --> 06:19.248
what if tonight
we had a ghost prom,

06:19.291 --> 06:20.771
right here in Thor's room?

06:22.904 --> 06:24.471
- Oh, my God. That's so fun!
- Yeah?

06:24.514 --> 06:26.995
Stephanie wants us
to throw a ghost prom.

06:27.038 --> 06:28.692
Oh, ghost Prom,
'cause that doesn't sound like

06:28.736 --> 06:30.477
the title to a horror movie.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.261
And I have
the perfect theme, too:

06:32.304 --> 06:33.480
No Livings Allowed.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.656
No Livings Allowed?

06:35.699 --> 06:37.614
It's not exactly
- Enchantment Under the Sea.
No, no, no.

06:37.658 --> 06:40.008
You know, it's just because
we know how busy you are,

06:40.051 --> 06:41.749
and we don't... we don't
want to get in your way.

06:41.792 --> 06:43.968
You were saying you were
too busy to help us earlier.

06:44.012 --> 06:46.275
I-I know, but... So, you know, in a way,

06:46.318 --> 06:47.755
I'm really...
I'm doing you a huge favor.

06:47.798 --> 06:49.496
I'm getting everyone
off your back for the night.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.672
And with Alberta's new power,
she can control the music

06:51.715 --> 06:53.151
and the lights, so...

06:53.195 --> 06:55.502
you're really,
you're not needed.

06:55.545 --> 06:56.764
At all.

06:56.807 --> 06:59.027
Okay, well, I mean, I could,
I could pop by

06:59.070 --> 07:00.420
just for, like,
a brief appearance.

07:00.463 --> 07:02.378
Samantha, do not worry about us.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.554
Do your cleaning
and we will be fine.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.904
Yeah, scrub-a-dub-dub.

07:21.092 --> 07:22.485
you already heard the answer.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.487
Just one more time.

07:24.531 --> 07:27.621
Alexa, how did
Alexander Hamilton die?

07:27.664 --> 07:30.275
Alexander Hamilton died
of a gunshot wound

07:30.319 --> 07:32.364
on July 12, 1804,

07:32.408 --> 07:33.757
at 47 years old.

07:33.801 --> 07:36.412
Again. Again.
Excuse me.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.502
Hi. We have, like,
a whole prom to plan.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.896
I mean, does anyone
even have a date yet?

07:41.939 --> 07:43.593
Uh...

07:45.377 --> 07:48.163
Uh...

07:49.773 --> 07:51.732
Were you planning on asking
anyone special, Isaac?

07:51.775 --> 07:53.473
Like a certain British officer
you murdered, perhaps?

07:53.516 --> 07:54.952
Shh! No.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.301
You are still the only one
that knows about that.

07:56.345 --> 07:58.086
And, no, I am not ready.

07:58.129 --> 08:00.915
Oh, God, who would've thought
that a prom of all things

08:00.958 --> 08:03.744
would create such
a stressful social situation.

08:03.787 --> 08:04.745
I have an idea.

08:04.788 --> 08:05.920
What if we all just went
together?

08:06.964 --> 08:08.009
As friendly companions.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.445
Oh, I love that. Yep. Yes.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.925
- A group thing.
- Group thing.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.622
- Yay!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.842
We're gonna go to prom
as friends?

08:14.885 --> 08:15.756
That's lame.

08:15.799 --> 08:17.584
What are we, a bunch of losers?

08:17.627 --> 08:19.499
- I'll go with you, Trevor.
- You know what, actually,

08:19.542 --> 08:20.761
we don't want anyone
to feel left out.

08:20.804 --> 08:22.937
I think that we should, uh,
go as friends.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.808
It's nice. Let's do that.

08:24.852 --> 08:26.114
Agreed.

08:26.157 --> 08:28.333
Now... again!

08:28.377 --> 08:30.597
Last time, I swear.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.339
You know, "no livings allowed"

08:34.383 --> 08:35.602
isn't even a theme.

08:35.645 --> 08:36.907
It's just, like, stupid.

08:36.951 --> 08:39.301
Oh, you're upset
about the ghost prom.

08:39.344 --> 08:40.650
As if.

08:40.694 --> 08:43.261
Like I care about
some stupid ghost prom.

08:43.305 --> 08:44.480
Whatever.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.699
Okay,
I don't want to be that guy,

08:45.742 --> 08:47.135
but I think
that's smooth enough.

08:47.178 --> 08:49.006
You seem like you really care.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.313
It's actually starting to get
a bit concave.

08:51.356 --> 08:52.793
Okay, fine.

08:52.836 --> 08:54.446
It's a bit of
a sore subject for me.

08:54.490 --> 08:55.926
Why is it a sore subject?

08:55.970 --> 08:57.580
<i>
When I was in high school,</i>

08:57.624 --> 08:59.495
<i>I loved everything French.</i>

08:59.539 --> 09:01.541
<i>The language, the food,</i>

09:01.584 --> 09:03.978
<i>the films I pretended</i> <i>
to understand.</i>

09:04.021 --> 09:07.547
I even had a French pen pal,
Pierre La Croix.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.941
We IM'd for, like, two months.

09:10.985 --> 09:13.814
And then he told me
he was going to come to America,

09:13.857 --> 09:16.512
right when prom was happening,
and he wanted to take me.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.210
Oh, no.
This is not gonna end well.

09:19.254 --> 09:20.647
Turned out Pierre wasn't real.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.605
Kelly Blankenship catfished
me as a cruel prank.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.739
I waited outside my house
for three hours.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.436
Of course,
he didn't show up,

09:27.479 --> 09:28.829
and then Kelly
and her friends drove past

09:28.872 --> 09:30.570
and threw baguettes
at me, and...

09:30.613 --> 09:32.484
the next day at school
was the worst.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.751
KELLY
Oh, we got you.

09:37.794 --> 09:40.797
So, you didn't ask him
why he was coming to America?

09:40.841 --> 09:42.799
Not a single follow-up question?

09:42.843 --> 09:44.888
Maybe, like, a flight number?

09:44.932 --> 09:47.108
I wanted it to be true, Jay,
but it wasn't.

09:47.151 --> 09:48.979
And, yes, that was the only
experience I had with prom.

09:49.023 --> 09:50.590
So forgive me,

09:50.633 --> 09:52.287
not getting invited
to the ghost prom

09:52.330 --> 09:54.289
gives me a little PTSD.

09:54.332 --> 09:55.812
Okay,
you really need to move on.

09:55.856 --> 09:58.641
Oh, I'm sorry, Pete,
it was very traumatic for me.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.164
No, no,
from that spot on the wall.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.166
Pretty soon, we're gonna be
exposing some wiring.

10:02.210 --> 10:05.126
I'm gonna show myself out.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.475
Pete's here?

10:07.302 --> 10:08.695
- Pete.
- He's gone.

10:08.738 --> 10:09.957
Aw, man.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.436
<i>
Ooh, ooh, ooh! Ask it to play</i>

10:11.480 --> 10:13.177
"China Cat Sunflower"No, I was next,

10:13.221 --> 10:15.658
and I require it to tell me if
the Vanderbilts ended up poor.

10:15.702 --> 10:16.877
Hey, I'm still waiting
for frozen pizzas

10:16.920 --> 10:18.661
- from the supermarket.
- Okay!

10:18.705 --> 10:19.662
This is getting out of hand.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.533
Shop is closed for the day.

10:21.577 --> 10:22.839
Y'all are needy.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.188
That's not fair.
I didn't even get a turn,

10:24.232 --> 10:25.625
and this is my room.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.452
Wait, you and Thor
switched rooms, Trevor?

10:27.496 --> 10:28.584
No, we both live
in here now.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.325
Sam had everyone pair up

10:30.368 --> 10:32.109
to use other rooms for guests.

10:32.153 --> 10:33.894
So, she forced you all
to room together?

10:34.895 --> 10:36.113
What is she, your dictator?

10:36.157 --> 10:38.681
Well, "dictator"
is a little strong.

10:38.725 --> 10:43.120
It's not like she's taxing us
on sugar and tobacco.

10:43.164 --> 10:46.471
But she can be
a little pushy, yeah.

10:46.515 --> 10:47.777
Uh, Stephanie.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.213
Can I have a word with you
out in the hall?

10:49.257 --> 10:50.998
Sure. <i>So, yeah.</i>

10:51.041 --> 10:52.695
You can see how
this whole banning Sam

10:52.739 --> 10:54.958
from ghost prom might bring up
a lot of issues for her.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.438
Wow, they threw a baguette
at her?

10:56.481 --> 10:58.701
And sadly, I believe
it was stale.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.964
Smart. I mean harsh.

11:01.008 --> 11:03.575
- Ah, yeah.
- Pete, you have come to the right person.

11:03.619 --> 11:05.926
Oh, I'm so glad.
And I won't say anything to her.

11:05.969 --> 11:08.319
I will let you surprise her
with the prom invite.

11:08.363 --> 11:09.712
Oh, I'll surprise her.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.932
Fantastic. Thank you.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.587
Hey, guys?

11:15.631 --> 11:16.719
I have an idea.

11:16.763 --> 11:19.069
We should totally
pull a prank Sam.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.245
Well, we wouldn't
want to do anything mean.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.726
No! No. No, just-just
a fun little prank

11:23.770 --> 11:25.293
to help her lighten up.

11:25.336 --> 11:26.686
Like how the-the colonists,

11:26.729 --> 11:28.078
they pulled that prank
on the king dude,

11:28.122 --> 11:29.514
where you all threw the tea
in the harbor.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.168
The Boston Tea Party.

11:31.212 --> 11:34.084
Well, all they were missing
was a giant shortbread cookie.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.087
That would've killed
at the tavern.

11:37.131 --> 11:38.959
Well, okay, if it's something
lighthearted like that,

11:39.002 --> 11:40.003
then sure.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.744
I think I have
something in mind.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.615
Alberta,
I'm gonna need your help

11:43.659 --> 11:45.269
with that Alexa thingy.

11:45.313 --> 11:46.793
Of course you are.

11:47.619 --> 11:49.796
Babe, you want to see
Josh in a Speedo?

11:49.839 --> 11:51.101
Are you talking about... The guests.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.755
Yes, it's always
about the guests.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.191
I'm in deep, and
you need accept it.

11:54.235 --> 11:55.584
Now, do you want to see
a middle-aged man

11:55.627 --> 11:56.672
in a Speedo or not?

11:56.716 --> 11:57.847
Sure, hand it over.

11:57.891 --> 11:59.370
Oh.

11:59.414 --> 12:00.676
Oh, no.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.025
What did you...
Did you like it?

12:02.069 --> 12:04.071
I didn't even see it. I...You liked it.

12:04.114 --> 12:05.986
Sam, this post
is from five years ago.

12:06.029 --> 12:08.379
Now he's gonna think
I'm some kind of weird stalker.

12:08.423 --> 12:09.641
- Mm.
- I know,

12:09.685 --> 12:11.121
but I don't want to
look like one.

12:12.688 --> 12:14.690
Uh, I got it.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.654
- Hey. What's this?
- It's your grocery order.

12:22.698 --> 12:26.006
20 baguettes
for a Mrs. Pierre La Croix.

12:26.049 --> 12:28.095
Pierre La Croix.

12:29.879 --> 12:31.620
Okay.

12:34.362 --> 12:36.103
Yeah! Come on, right?

12:36.146 --> 12:38.409
We got you good, right?

12:38.453 --> 12:40.672
That's funny, huh?

12:40.716 --> 12:42.762
Pete, you told them about this?

12:42.805 --> 12:44.851
No. I-I mean, yes,
but I-I just...

12:44.894 --> 12:46.722
Oh, ho. Is the lady upset

12:46.766 --> 12:48.593
about the little prank?

12:48.637 --> 12:50.334
I can't believe
you did that, Pete.

12:50.378 --> 12:51.771
Babe, are you okay?

12:51.814 --> 12:53.555
Sam, I'm sorry. Samantha.

12:53.598 --> 12:55.165
It was
supposed to be funny.

13:02.607 --> 13:05.349
Okay, so Sam definitely
not enjoy that prank.

13:05.393 --> 13:07.003
What was that all about?

13:07.047 --> 13:08.875
What the H-E-C-K, Stephanie?

13:08.918 --> 13:10.528
I told you that stuff
about the French guy

13:10.572 --> 13:12.617
so you could help Sam.
I trusted you.

13:12.661 --> 13:14.010
Hold up.
What y'all talking about?

13:14.054 --> 13:16.317
Sam told me this very sad tale
about her own prom,

13:16.360 --> 13:17.579
and how she thought
she was going

13:17.622 --> 13:19.015
with this hunky French guy,

13:19.059 --> 13:21.061
but it turned out some mean girl
was just tricking her.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.149
Aw.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.541
Poor Samantha.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.326
Yes, that is
the appropriate reaction.

13:25.369 --> 13:26.849
You know what's not appropriate?

13:26.893 --> 13:30.548
Weaponizing Sam's pain the way
Chainsaw Madonna here did.

13:30.592 --> 13:33.203
I mean,
I don't know about Madonna.

13:33.247 --> 13:34.639
- He said it.
- Oh, my God.

13:34.683 --> 13:36.554
Wait, so basically,
Sam got traumatized

13:36.598 --> 13:37.860
by some mean girl
in high school,

13:37.904 --> 13:39.862
and now Steph
is making her relive it?

13:39.906 --> 13:42.386
And making us pawns
in her sick game.

13:42.430 --> 13:43.735
What is wrong with you,
Stephanie?

13:43.779 --> 13:45.128
You're 53 years old.

13:45.172 --> 13:47.087
- You should know better.
- You hear that, Trev?

13:47.130 --> 13:48.088
Not happening.

13:48.131 --> 13:49.567
Okay. Whatever.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.743
Sam's the mean girl here.
She deserves it.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.223
You guys all
said it before, too.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.182
She acts like she's
the boss of you, remember?

13:55.225 --> 13:59.055
Mm-mmm! I have walked a mile
in Sam's shoes today,

13:59.099 --> 14:00.709
and that woman is a saint.

14:00.752 --> 14:03.451
Y'all coming up to me
every second, asking something,

14:03.494 --> 14:04.669
wanting stuff.

14:04.713 --> 14:05.757
"Who won the World Series

14:05.801 --> 14:07.629
in 1993?"
Who cares!

14:07.672 --> 14:08.978
"What's the capitol of Idaho?"

14:09.022 --> 14:11.241
- Child, I don't give a damn!
- It's Boise.

14:11.285 --> 14:13.853
So yeah, maybe Sam does have
some demands and rules,

14:13.896 --> 14:16.333
but she needs them
'cause y'all are annoying.

14:16.377 --> 14:17.552
Mm.

14:17.595 --> 14:18.858
Well, it's tough
to rally the troops

14:18.901 --> 14:20.250
when you end like that,

14:20.294 --> 14:21.643
but I agree with you.

14:21.686 --> 14:24.254
We all owe Sam an apology.

14:24.298 --> 14:25.516
Well, you know what?

14:25.560 --> 14:27.692
Anyone apologizes
to that jerkwad,

14:27.736 --> 14:29.520
you're out of the prom.

14:29.564 --> 14:34.090
Well, then I guess
we are out of the prom.

14:34.134 --> 14:36.440
No one calls my descendant
a jerkwad,

14:36.484 --> 14:39.400
which from context I take to be
some sort of derision.

14:40.227 --> 14:44.231
We trusted you, man,
and you stole our money.

14:44.274 --> 14:46.320
That's not what happ...
Okay, let's just go. Come on.

14:46.363 --> 14:47.887
- Come on.
- Yeah.

14:48.670 --> 14:51.064
Okay, fine. Go, then.

14:51.107 --> 14:53.718
I don't need you, you losers.

14:53.762 --> 14:55.677
No one likes you!

14:56.460 --> 14:59.289
The basement ghosts
think you're lame!

15:00.116 --> 15:02.684
Hey, babe.
Just checking on you.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.599
Seeing how you're doing.

15:04.642 --> 15:06.427
Whether or not
you need some butter.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.821
- Okay, it's too soon.
- Stephanie's just...

15:09.865 --> 15:11.823
- She's such a jerk.
- Yeah, but,

15:11.867 --> 15:13.564
babe, are you sure
this isn't about

15:13.608 --> 15:14.914
the mean girl from your past

15:14.957 --> 15:17.394
and not the dead one
from your present?

15:17.438 --> 15:19.179
I don't know, probably,
but I just...

15:19.222 --> 15:20.920
I can't believe
the ghosts went along with it.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.922
And I can't believe I even care.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.924
I'm mad at a bunch of
invisible people, Jay.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.796
Samantha,
if we could have a word.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.103
The ghosts just all came in.

15:30.146 --> 15:31.843
We came to say we're sorry.

15:31.887 --> 15:34.411
Oh, great, 'cause I'm about
to give all you guys

15:34.455 --> 15:37.675
a piece of my m... No, they were apologizing.

15:37.719 --> 15:40.287
Oh. Okay.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.071
I'll allow it.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.552
I only told Stephanie
what happened to you

15:44.595 --> 15:46.554
because I was trying to
get you invited to the prom.

15:46.597 --> 15:48.382
Stephanie manipulated us.

15:48.425 --> 15:50.253
I didn't even get the
whole baguette thing.

15:50.297 --> 15:51.776
But then Stephanie made me
feel stupid for not getting it.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.082
Me, too.
Point is, we didn't know

15:53.126 --> 15:55.302
that you had been tricked
in high school.

15:55.345 --> 15:56.781
It's so rude.

15:56.825 --> 15:58.305
Telling you that the hot
foreign exchange student

15:58.348 --> 15:59.393
had a crush on you?

15:59.436 --> 16:01.786
No, he wasn't
an exchange student.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.005
He still lived
in France.

16:03.049 --> 16:05.660
We were more like
online pen pals.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.488
Wait, wait, wait, I'm sorry,
so you thought he was coming

16:07.531 --> 16:10.795
all the way from Europe to go
to a school dance in Ohio?

16:10.839 --> 16:11.971
WellGuys, I'm sure

16:12.014 --> 16:13.320
the mean girl
got her older brother

16:13.363 --> 16:15.757
on the phone or something
to do a French accent.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.628
Uh, no, we never actually spoke.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.543
Trying to defend you, Sam.
Not making it easy.

16:19.587 --> 16:20.762
Look, it doesn't matter

16:20.805 --> 16:23.808
how naive or clueless
you may have been.

16:23.852 --> 16:25.332
You didn't deserve
to be hurt like that.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.464
And we would never purposely

16:27.508 --> 16:29.118
make you feel worse about it.

16:29.162 --> 16:30.511
- That's right.
- Absolutely.

16:30.554 --> 16:31.773
No.
- Thanks, guys.

16:31.816 --> 16:32.774
And don't worry,

16:32.817 --> 16:34.558
we got her back.

16:34.602 --> 16:35.995
Yeah.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.214
We leave her all
alone by herself to feel sad.

16:38.258 --> 16:39.433
Very funny.

16:39.476 --> 16:40.651
Oh, gosh.

16:40.695 --> 16:43.393
She is going to have
the worst prom ever.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.658
Well, maybe not
"the worst" worst.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.138
- Second-worst.
- And come tomorrow.

16:49.182 --> 16:50.835
She'll fall back asleep
for another year,

16:50.879 --> 16:52.141
so you won't have
to worry about her.

16:52.185 --> 16:53.490
Easy.
Wait,

16:53.534 --> 16:54.665
so this girl is only awake

16:54.709 --> 16:56.189
for, like, one night a year,

16:56.232 --> 16:58.713
and she's going to spend it
alone on prom night,

16:58.756 --> 17:00.019
the very event
that she tried to recreate

17:00.062 --> 17:01.629
because she died that night?

17:01.672 --> 17:04.371
Ugh, don't make us feel bad
for that little psychopath.

17:04.414 --> 17:07.417
I didn't know how to deal with
the mean girl back in my day,

17:07.461 --> 17:10.029
but I know what we need
to do for this one.

17:10.072 --> 17:12.857
Ugh, you're gonna do something
nice for her, aren't you?

17:12.901 --> 17:14.598
Yes, Hetty, we are.

17:14.642 --> 17:16.252
How are we even related?

17:16.296 --> 17:17.993
Stephanie, can you <i>
come downstairs?</i>

17:18.037 --> 17:19.777
<i>There's something</i> <i>
I want to show you.</i>

17:20.822 --> 17:24.391
Surprise!

17:24.434 --> 17:26.871
What the hell is going on?

17:26.915 --> 17:29.352
It's prom night, 1987.

17:29.396 --> 17:31.093
You made it.

17:31.137 --> 17:33.443
Oh, my God,
you did all this for me?

17:33.487 --> 17:35.271
So do you think she'll
get sucked off now?

17:35.315 --> 17:38.622
Sucked off at prom?
I suppose anything's possible.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.320
Hmm.

17:43.236 --> 17:45.629
Ooh!

17:45.673 --> 17:47.283
Okay.

17:47.327 --> 17:48.458
Ooh, I'm gonna get dizzy.

17:48.502 --> 17:50.373
- Come on, vertigo.
- Thor,

17:50.417 --> 17:52.854
talk to her.

17:54.421 --> 17:56.075
Flower, it, uh,

17:56.118 --> 17:58.120
seems you are also here tonight.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.079
Yeah, Thor, we're all are.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.254
- Duh.
- What?

18:01.297 --> 18:03.517
Stephanie taught me that.
It's stupid.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.040
Oh.

18:05.084 --> 18:09.218
Look, I don't want to rush
anything, but tonight is prom.

18:09.262 --> 18:11.525
Also, only one night and...

18:11.568 --> 18:12.917
Do you want to dance?

18:12.961 --> 18:15.311
Yes! So much easier
when you ask.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.357

18:31.936 --> 18:32.894
If you'll have me.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.940
Jay. You got me a corsage?

18:35.984 --> 18:38.291
I got you the nicest corsage

18:38.334 --> 18:39.422
that I could find

18:39.466 --> 18:41.424
at the supermarket
on a Sunday night.

18:41.468 --> 18:44.819
Well, it's perfect.
Can I have this dance?

18:44.862 --> 18:47.256
- Oh, aren't we skipping a step?
- What do you mean?

18:47.300 --> 18:48.866
Well, aren't you supposed to

it, and then I also love it?

19:50.667 --> 19:52.103
Thank you so much

19:52.147 --> 19:53.148
for decorating my room.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.367
It's so bitchin' now.

19:54.410 --> 19:55.803
Oh, Stephanie says thanks

19:55.846 --> 19:56.978
for decorating the room, Jay.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.980
Oh, good, good, good.

19:59.023 --> 20:00.764
I-I'm sorry,
I'm just distracted. Uh...

20:00.808 --> 20:04.377
Josh just liked a bunch of
my photos from a few years ago.

20:04.420 --> 20:07.162
Oh, this trip
is gonna be awkward.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.643
Anyway, one final touch.

20:09.686 --> 20:11.775
I know you like these guys.

20:11.906 --> 20:13.951
That's my
favorite band.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.953
Thank you, dude.
I thought U2

20:15.997 --> 20:18.260
was the website where creepy
Todd's video made me famous.

20:18.304 --> 20:19.783
Again, "famous"
is a stretch,

20:19.827 --> 20:22.308
and I believe it's
called WhoTube.

20:22.351 --> 20:26.573
No, that's YouTube. U2 is a
popular rock band from Ireland.

20:26.616 --> 20:28.444
- Oh, no.
- They're Irish?

20:28.488 --> 20:30.316
- That's lovely.
- Hetty...

20:30.359 --> 20:31.534
Of all the bands

20:31.578 --> 20:32.796
in all the lands.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.102
I can handle it.

20:34.145 --> 20:36.235
- You should take it down.
- No, that's my poster.

20:36.278 --> 20:38.062
- Take it down.
- That's my special new poster.

20:38.106 --> 20:39.238
- Take it down!
- No!
