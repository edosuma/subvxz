Well, he can't, actually,
until he finds his pants.

01:44.039 --> 01:46.073
- I've looked everywhere.
- Nice.

Maura, is Thursday still
good to bring Allie by?

02:00.806 --> 02:05.376
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Great.

02:05.410 --> 02:09.045
- See you, Jane.
- Mm.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.948
Good ... good luck with your pants.

02:11.015 --> 02:12.750
Don't you think that was a little terse?

02:12.784 --> 02:16.020
I'm sorry. Men in kimonos
make me uncomfortable.

02:16.054 --> 02:17.722
"Kimono."

02:17.789 --> 02:20.958
It's a generic word, like "clothing."
There's no plural.

02:20.992 --> 02:22.760
And it's suitable for
both men and women.

02:22.794 --> 02:26.063
You know, in Japan, wearing
a kimono is called kitsuke.

02:26.098 --> 02:27.965
In America, we call it "walk of shame."

02:28.033 --> 02:30.067
Do us all a favor. Buy
the man some jammies.

02:30.102 --> 02:31.970

03:00.966 --> 03:03.901
Her seventh-grade class is
doing a career study project,

03:03.935 --> 03:06.437
and she wants to shadow
me for extra credit.

03:06.471 --> 03:08.706
That's pretty grown up
for a seventh grader.

03:08.774 --> 03:12.476
- What do you mean by "grown up"?
- Boring.

03:12.511 --> 03:14.979
Well, do you doubt my
abilities to make forensics fun?

03:15.013 --> 03:18.816
Did you hear that sentence
that just came out of your face?

03:18.850 --> 03:21.485
Well, if conversation lags, I'll vamp.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.821
I'll talk about things that
interested me at that age.

03:23.855 --> 03:27.491
- Such as?
- My favorite books.

03:27.526 --> 03:29.627
Or, you know, when I was her age,

03:29.661 --> 03:32.930
I did a science project on
the antimicrobial properties

03:32.964 --> 03:35.761
of common foods.
Garlic gets the most press,

03:35.796 --> 03:38.803
but the cruciferous family
is not to be underestimated.

03:38.837 --> 03:45.009
So, your plan "B" is
"Anne of green gables" or broccoli.

03:45.043 --> 03:47.211
Good luck with that.

Danielle Mitchell.

03:52.150 --> 03:57.021
- Let me guess. 20-something?
- How do you know?

03:57.055 --> 04:00.591
Is there a law that
requires people to decorate

04:00.625 --> 04:04.161
their first apartments
with the same five posters?

04:04.196 --> 04:06.096
10 bucks there's
a "Breakfast at Tiffany's" poster

04:06.164 --> 04:08.999
- on the wall in her bedroom.
- Oh, you cannot know that.

04:09.034 --> 04:11.769
- Want to bet?
- Taste is an individual's preference

04:11.837 --> 04:13.604
based on their specific
cultural experience.

04:13.672 --> 04:17.007
- It is impossible to predict.
- No, no, no, wait.

04:17.041 --> 04:19.610
Marilyn Monroe, white
dress, on the subway grate.

04:19.644 --> 04:22.012

- Deal.

04:26.685 --> 04:30.855

- Maybe after.

04:30.889 --> 04:32.723
All right, but don't
think I'm gonna forget.

04:32.757 --> 04:34.625
What do we know?

04:34.693 --> 04:37.161
No forced entry.
Doesn't look like she was robbed.

04:37.195 --> 04:38.829
The neighbors didn't
hear anything last night.

04:38.897 --> 04:40.097
Anybody know what time she came home?

04:40.165 --> 04:42.967
Guy across the hall works a
night shift, said she got in late,

04:43.001 --> 04:44.268
couldn't tell if she
was with anybody, though.

04:46.938 --> 04:49.673

04:49.708 --> 04:51.675
Well, the bag does suggest asphyxia,

04:51.710 --> 04:53.911
but i'll need to
confirm it with the lab.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.546
It's a pretty tidy crime scene,

04:55.580 --> 04:57.615
especially for somebody
who's been strangled.

04:57.649 --> 04:59.717

they knew nobody was coming home.

05:05.123 --> 05:09.059
Look how she's laid out
and how deliberate it is.

05:09.094 --> 05:10.928
Like they knew what they were doing.

05:10.962 --> 05:13.797
Makes me think it's because
they've done it before.

05:19.004 --> 05:20.771
[door opens]

05:20.805 --> 05:24.808
- You owe me 20 bucks, Dr. Isles.
- It is on my desk.

05:24.843 --> 05:26.810
But just for the record,

05:26.845 --> 05:29.246
I do want to say that I
think you are underestimating

05:29.281 --> 05:32.829
- the merit of Danielle's posters.
- What? You mean you're

05:32.864 --> 05:35.986
gonna get like a Bob
Marley mosaic in y... No!

05:36.021 --> 05:38.289
"Keep calm and buy shoes."

05:38.323 --> 05:39.957
Ooh, that's good.
I haven't heard that one.

05:39.991 --> 05:42.993
Well, I'm not talking about taste.
I'm talking about

05:43.061 --> 05:45.162
the evolutionary basis
for cultural trends.

05:45.196 --> 05:47.264
There is no evolutionary basis

05:47.299 --> 05:49.566
for beer hats and foam fingers.

05:49.634 --> 05:52.002
Imitation is a survival strategy.

05:52.037 --> 05:54.805
You know, the viceroy butterfly
imitates the appearance

05:54.839 --> 05:56.607
of the less-palatable monarch,

05:56.641 --> 05:59.743
thereby deterring predators
and ensuring survival.

05:59.778 --> 06:00.911
For butterflies.

06:00.979 --> 06:04.114
My point is that being unoriginal
can have its advantages.

06:06.918 --> 06:08.652
Not for Danielle.

06:10.722 --> 06:12.723
Petechial hemorrhaging confirms

06:12.757 --> 06:14.992
that the cause of
death was asphyxiation.

06:15.060 --> 06:18.062
Yeah, that's what we were saying
was the M.O. in our NCIC search.

06:18.096 --> 06:21.131
- Anything so far?
- Eh, a few strangulations,

06:21.166 --> 06:23.701
a few girls in Danielle's demographic,

06:23.735 --> 06:26.403
but nothing that can prove
that this was a repeat killing.

06:26.438 --> 06:30.641
I need a special detail that can
link her to the other victims.

06:30.675 --> 06:33.010
Jasmine hess.

06:34.412 --> 06:38.682
Okay. Uh...

06:38.717 --> 06:40.384
Yeah, "Hess, Jasmine."

06:40.452 --> 06:44.054
Found dead in Plymouth
County about six months ago.

06:44.122 --> 06:46.991
She was strangled,
laid out on her bed.

06:47.058 --> 06:49.126
Oh, no, no, her case is unique.

06:49.160 --> 06:52.796
- The M.E. ...
- Found a cork...

06:52.831 --> 06:56.135
- in her throat.
- Well, it looks like there's

06:56.170 --> 06:58.268
something to your theory
of imitation after all.

06:58.303 --> 07:00.938
Imitation? What makes you
think it's not the same person?

07:00.972 --> 07:03.868
Because the guy that did this
murder is already in jail.

07:12.506 --> 07:16.142
This side is the Plymouth County case,
and this side is Danielle.

07:16.177 --> 07:19.145
Two girls killed the same
way by two different people.

07:19.180 --> 07:21.748
Assuming they got the
right guy in the first case,

07:21.816 --> 07:23.950
this is either a
coincidence or a copycat.

07:24.018 --> 07:25.585
Tell me about our girl.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.020
Well, she worked as a
waitress in the back bay.

07:27.054 --> 07:28.521
Her credit card records
are all pretty normal.

07:28.589 --> 07:32.826
Largest expense is a hotel reservation
for next month in Hawaii.

07:32.860 --> 07:34.661
Probably would have
been a nice vacation.

07:34.695 --> 07:36.630
- Do we know who she was going with?
- Still working on it.

07:36.664 --> 07:40.100
Other than that, no serious
debt, no weird activity.

07:40.134 --> 07:41.267
What about the Plymouth County victim?

07:41.302 --> 07:43.937
- We find any connection between them?
- Well, they're about the same age,

07:43.971 --> 07:45.772
but they didn't appear
to know each other,

07:45.806 --> 07:48.608
no shared interests, no mutual
friends, No connections at all.

07:48.643 --> 07:50.710
Except they both wound up strangled
with a cork in their throat.

07:50.745 --> 07:52.946
Ah, except that.

07:52.980 --> 07:57.150
In the trial records, the original
killer had dated the victim.

07:57.184 --> 08:00.153
Now, he said the cork
was his way to shut her up

08:00.221 --> 08:02.789
after she tried to dump him,
"I put a cork in it."

08:02.823 --> 08:06.059
Subtle.
Maybe Danielle had a boyfriend

08:06.093 --> 08:08.061
who used the cork
killing as inspiration?

08:08.095 --> 08:12.265
Possibly, but nobody in her
building saw her with anyone.

08:12.299 --> 08:14.534
Well, let's talk to her
friends and co-workers.

08:14.568 --> 08:17.037
If there was a guy in her
life, somebody knew about him.

08:17.071 --> 08:18.238
Already on it.

08:18.305 --> 08:22.008
There is a connection between these
girls. We just have to find it.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.778
<i>Mallory: So sad.</i>

08:24.812 --> 08:28.048
We were supposed to work
a shift together tonight.

08:28.082 --> 08:29.816
What can you tell me about Danni?

08:29.850 --> 08:34.054
She was sweet...
fun.

08:34.087 --> 08:36.523
We worked every weekend together.

08:36.590 --> 08:39.058
We used to hang out after
closing all the time.

08:39.092 --> 08:44.197
- You used to?
- Before the package entered the picture.

08:44.265 --> 08:47.801
- What's "the package"?
- We think he was her boyfriend.

08:47.835 --> 08:52.739
She stopped hanging out, was
always on her phone during breaks,

08:52.773 --> 08:54.874
except out in the alley
instead of in the back

08:54.909 --> 08:59.846
where the rest of us took calls.
It was like some big secret.

08:59.880 --> 09:03.116
- When did that start?
- A couple of months ago.

09:03.150 --> 09:07.912
All she ever said about him
was "he's the total package."

09:09.356 --> 09:11.357
We teased her a lot about that.

09:11.392 --> 09:13.626
And she never even told you his name?

09:13.694 --> 09:17.697
No. I just thought he was into
something illegal or married.

09:17.732 --> 09:19.232
Do you think she was
with him the other night?

09:19.266 --> 09:22.335
I really don't know.

09:22.369 --> 09:27.207
But if he did do this, I
really hope you catch him.

09:30.044 --> 09:31.344
[keyboard clacking]

09:31.412 --> 09:33.012
Oh, man. [scoffs]

09:33.080 --> 09:36.116
I never got the appeal
of rhinestones on phones.

09:36.183 --> 09:40.120
- Nothing wrong with a little bling.
- Come on. It looks like

09:40.187 --> 09:43.123
Hello Kitty threw up on My Little Pony.

09:45.025 --> 09:47.327
You were saying?
[keyboard clacking]

09:47.361 --> 09:49.829
Is that your...?
[mouse clicks]

09:49.897 --> 09:53.967
Well, in ...
you know, in ... that bling is ...

09:54.001 --> 09:58.138
is quite tasteful.
You know, in ... in this context,

09:58.172 --> 10:03.777
- I find that I am, uh, pro-bling.
- You're pro-bling?

10:03.811 --> 10:07.313
Bring on the bling.

10:07.348 --> 10:12.719
- I could do your phone.
- Would you?

10:12.753 --> 10:13.853
[chuckles]

10:15.756 --> 10:17.724
If your victim was taking
calls out in the alley,

10:17.758 --> 10:19.692
they were either to her
mom or the cable company.

10:19.727 --> 10:21.861
There are no mystery numbers
that point to a boyfriend.

10:21.896 --> 10:23.363
What about her hard drive?

10:23.397 --> 10:25.799
I cross-referenced the pictures
on her phone and computer

10:25.833 --> 10:27.934
with the friends in her
social-media network.

10:27.968 --> 10:29.235
She's got a lot of friends,

10:29.270 --> 10:31.137
but no one that looks
like our mystery man.

10:31.205 --> 10:32.872
[sighs]

10:32.907 --> 10:35.441
<i>She was a lot less active
online the last six months,</i>

10:35.476 --> 10:38.211
<i>fewer posts.
If she did have a new boyfriend ...</i>

10:38.245 --> 10:40.747
She didn't want anybody
to know about it.

10:40.781 --> 10:43.082
<i>Come on, Danni. Where
are you hiding this guy?</i>

10:43.117 --> 10:44.951
There are a few
password-protected files

10:44.985 --> 10:46.953
on her hard drive that
I haven't cracked yet.

10:46.987 --> 10:49.355
Any guesses?
Did she have a pet cat or something?

10:49.390 --> 10:51.024
People do that ... pet names?

10:51.058 --> 10:54.794
Pets, their own birthdays, and
the ever-popular "password."

10:54.829 --> 10:56.296
- You're kidding.
- Nope.

10:56.330 --> 10:57.897
But I've tried all of those.

10:59.333 --> 11:00.834
Try "package."

11:04.138 --> 11:05.872
[computer beeps]

11:05.940 --> 11:07.373
Newspaper clippings.

11:07.408 --> 11:10.210
Every one is on the
Plymouth County murder trial.

11:10.244 --> 11:13.046
Why the sudden fascination
with a creepy murder trial?

11:13.080 --> 11:16.416
She did password-protect the file
with her boyfriend's nickname.

11:16.450 --> 11:18.184
And the co-worker said
they met a few months ago.

11:18.219 --> 11:19.919
That's when the trial started.

11:19.987 --> 11:21.921
Her boyfriend's gonna get
her wrapped up in this trial

11:21.956 --> 11:23.489
and he's gonna kill her the same way?

11:23.524 --> 11:25.158
If that was his plan, it
would explain why he wanted her

11:25.192 --> 11:26.392
to keep their relationship secret.

11:26.427 --> 11:29.262
- It's a weird plan.
- Murderers are weird.

11:29.330 --> 11:32.298
Is it possible the
prosecution got the wrong guy

11:32.333 --> 11:35.576

with the real killer?

11:45.779 --> 11:48.248
Vince! What a surprise.

11:48.315 --> 11:50.884
I'm meeting Angela for lunch.
Would you like to join us?

11:50.918 --> 11:52.352
Oh, thanks. I was
just leaving, actually.

11:52.386 --> 11:54.821
- Are you sure?
- What do you think of this place?

11:54.855 --> 11:57.390
- How do you mean?
- Just in general.

11:57.458 --> 11:59.158
What would you say about it
if someone asked your opinion?

11:59.193 --> 12:02.061
Too many sprouts.
[chuckles]

12:02.096 --> 12:06.065
Hi, Vince.
We need to talk.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.470
Maura: Oh, Jane.
I didn't know you were joining us.

12:10.504 --> 12:13.039
- I'm here under protest.
- She's here to back me up.

12:13.073 --> 12:16.175
You have a problem, and,
fortunately, I can help you.

12:16.210 --> 12:18.044
I might have accidentally told her

12:18.112 --> 12:20.780
that you are meeting
Jack's daughter tomorrow.

12:20.815 --> 12:22.553
<i>I am sorry.</i>

12:22.588 --> 12:25.852
- Why is that a problem?
- It isn't, as long as she likes you.

12:25.886 --> 12:30.223
- You have to impress her.
- Okay, so, what do you suggest?

12:30.257 --> 12:33.526
Practice talking about things
that interest young girls.

12:33.560 --> 12:34.961
I can do that.

12:37.064 --> 12:40.333
I can!
Okay, try me.

12:40.367 --> 12:43.403
What are your thoughts
about "Pretty Little Liars"?

12:43.437 --> 12:46.839
I don't think it's good to lie
whether you're pretty or little.

12:50.210 --> 12:54.447
- Do you know who, uh, Lady Antebellum is?
- Is that a person?

12:54.515 --> 12:57.150
How about Lady Gaga?

12:57.184 --> 12:59.852
I am more familiar with
"Lady and the Tramp."

12:59.887 --> 13:01.321
Okay, this is worse than I thought.

13:01.355 --> 13:04.257
Look, I took these from my nail salon.

13:05.926 --> 13:10.229
- Get busy.
- How is anyone supposed to retain this?

13:10.264 --> 13:12.598
Well, pretend that they're
all dead if you have to.

13:12.633 --> 13:16.202
But if you want to hit it off with
Allie, don't stop until you know

13:16.270 --> 13:19.872

Cee Lo, and  L-M-F-A-O.

13:19.940 --> 13:21.574
What?

13:23.110 --> 13:26.858
- Anything?
- I've combed through every website

13:26.859 --> 13:30.016
Danni clicked on in the last year.
Nothing unusual.

13:30.050 --> 13:31.918
The only chat room she
was in was in a discussion

13:31.986 --> 13:33.353
about making meringue.

13:34.254 --> 13:37.623
- It's a delicate process.
- Mnh.

13:37.658 --> 13:39.158
So, unless the boyfriend was pastry chef,

13:39.193 --> 13:41.127
we have no idea how she met him.

13:41.161 --> 13:43.863
Or how he factored into
the Plymouth County case.

13:43.897 --> 13:45.365
No leads from her parents?

13:45.399 --> 13:48.001
No. They said she was
chronically single.

13:48.068 --> 13:49.969
And we have no other suspects,

13:50.004 --> 13:52.138
so this boyfriend is
our guy, whoever he is.

13:52.172 --> 13:55.074
I think I got something.
We think there's a connection

13:55.109 --> 13:56.943
between the boyfriend
and the case, right?

13:57.011 --> 13:58.211
What we don't know is,

13:58.245 --> 13:59.445
did the boyfriend spark her interest...

13:59.480 --> 14:01.047
Or was she interested in the case

14:01.081 --> 14:02.615
and that's what led
her to the boyfriend?

14:02.683 --> 14:04.406
Yeah. Either way, I figure somebody who

14:04.407 --> 14:06.085
collected every article about the case

14:06.153 --> 14:08.021
might have actually gone
down to the courthouse

14:08.055 --> 14:09.322

14:27.007 --> 14:29.909
- Nina, who is she texting?
- It's got to be the boyfriend.

14:29.943 --> 14:31.978
No record of texts matching
the time stamps on this footage.

14:32.012 --> 14:34.013
'Cause that's not her phone.

14:34.048 --> 14:35.648

that's right here.

14:35.682 --> 14:38.684
- This is just a plain black phone.
- Burner, maybe?

14:38.719 --> 14:40.253
Yeah, that's why we have no records ...

14:40.287 --> 14:41.654
she had a separate phone for him.

14:41.688 --> 14:43.322
We ... we got to see
what number she's texting.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.495
[monitor beeping]

victim, also happens to be the

15:22.683 --> 15:26.628

prosecuted the Plymouth County case.

- He is also very married.
- Okay.

15:39.008 --> 15:43.679
You ... You keep saying
"okay," and, to me, it seems...

15:43.746 --> 15:45.514
Like the opposite of "okay."

15:45.582 --> 15:47.482
Well, I'm gonna ask a question
that I don't really want to ask.

15:47.517 --> 15:49.151
Do we suspect him?

15:49.185 --> 15:52.087
Well, we can't rule him out,
not until we talk to him.

15:52.155 --> 15:54.356
I need to caution you against
jumping to conclusions too early.

15:54.390 --> 15:56.258
- Okay.
- I'm trying to protect

neighboring prosecutor's office.

and is, by all accounts, a good guy.

We're investigating a homicide
here. We're not blowing

going easy on a suspect

16:10.440 --> 16:12.174
for political reasons is not your style.

16:12.208 --> 16:16.144
- That's one way to put it.
- Hence my concern.

16:17.146 --> 16:19.248
About your ability to control your face.

that links infidelity

- So, cheating is genetic?

The variant is genetic,
but the behavior can be modulated

by the individual, though
not in this case, apparently.

I did a DNA profile on.

23:11.994 --> 23:13.528
Some of it was Danni's.

23:13.596 --> 23:15.096
Some of it was Wescourt's.

23:15.131 --> 23:17.532
So, Paul Wescourt's
hair is in a shower drain

23:17.566 --> 23:20.068
of an apartment that he
claims to have never been in.

23:20.102 --> 23:23.705
- And the DNA test is conclusive.
- Well, why would he lie about this?

23:23.739 --> 23:25.707
He told us the truth about the affair.

23:25.741 --> 23:27.909
Maybe he thought he'd
covered all of his tracks.

23:27.943 --> 23:29.210
And if he is lying,

23:29.245 --> 23:31.079
that brings everything
he's said into question.

23:31.147 --> 23:33.815
How can we even know if their
relationship was consensual?

23:33.883 --> 23:36.184
It's almost impossible
to prove forensically.

23:36.252 --> 23:37.619
[sighs]

23:37.653 --> 23:38.887
Not to mention the previous case.

23:38.921 --> 23:40.088
I mean, this guy could
have done both murders

23:40.122 --> 23:41.690
and put away an innocent man.

23:41.757 --> 23:44.888
Well, it is possible that
the hair was carried in on

23:44.889 --> 23:48.196
Danni's body and wound up in
the drain when she showered.

23:48.230 --> 23:50.098
- It seems unlikely.
- That's what I said,

23:50.166 --> 23:52.701
Which is why I sent
CSRU back to the scene.

23:52.735 --> 23:54.602
And this time, they got a print.

23:54.637 --> 23:57.639
- Want to guess whose it was?
- So, his mistress is dead,

23:57.673 --> 23:59.574
his prints are at the scene,
and his alibi is paper-thin.

23:59.608 --> 24:01.142
Did he think he would
just lie to our faces

24:01.177 --> 24:02.477
and get away with it?

24:02.511 --> 24:05.146
- Let's go ask him, shall we?
- Yes, let's.

24:11.914 --> 24:12.947
[knock on door]

24:13.581 --> 24:16.417
Detectives. What a surprise.

24:16.451 --> 24:18.419
I thought we agreed to discretion.

24:18.453 --> 24:20.721
I thought you agreed
to tell us the truth.

24:22.791 --> 24:25.626
Can we, uh, talk somewhere else?

24:25.661 --> 24:27.562
We found your DNA at the crime scene.

24:27.596 --> 24:29.263
Would you like to come with us?

24:29.298 --> 24:31.265
Should we do the whole perp-walk thing?

24:31.300 --> 24:33.367
<i>Hello.
[exhales sharply]</i>

24:33.402 --> 24:36.504
Mrs. Wescourt, hello.
I'm Detective Rizzoli.

24:36.538 --> 24:39.540
This is Sergeant Korsak.
Boston homicide.

24:39.608 --> 24:41.008
Sorry to barge in on you like this.

24:41.076 --> 24:42.810
Oh, it's no problem.
Would you like some coffee?

24:42.845 --> 24:43.845
No, thank you.

24:44.980 --> 24:48.449
- We just need Paul to come with us.
- Why? What happened?

24:48.483 --> 24:50.779
- It's nothing. It's a mistake.
- Would you like for us

24:50.780 --> 24:52.987
to talk to your wife about
the details of the case?

24:53.021 --> 24:55.556
Carol, please go in the other
room while I sort this out.

24:55.591 --> 24:58.992
No. Somebody tell me what's
going on this instant.

25:00.562 --> 25:02.730
Your husband is under arrest.

25:03.932 --> 25:06.197
For homicide?

25:07.102 --> 25:09.861
- Paul...
- Listen to me.

25:09.896 --> 25:11.095
Do not speak to anyone until you get

25:11.096 --> 25:13.608
Marty Ackerman on the phone.
Do you understand?

25:13.642 --> 25:15.309
Marty?
You want me to call our lawyer?

25:15.344 --> 25:17.545
But you say only guilty
people get lawyers.

25:17.613 --> 25:18.980
[chuckles]
Carol, please, I'm innocent.

25:19.014 --> 25:21.949
This is a mistake.
I'll make bail.

25:22.017 --> 25:24.619
I'll be back by tonight.
Please, Carol.

25:24.653 --> 25:25.653
[gasps]

25:25.687 --> 25:27.121
<i>Korsak: Paul Wescourt,</i>

25:27.155 --> 25:28.522
you're under arrest for the
murder of Danielle Mitchell.

25:32.527 --> 25:34.795
[sighs] Oh, my...

25:37.249 --> 25:40.718
[knock on door]

25:40.752 --> 25:43.687
- Dr. Isles?
- My friends call me Maura.

25:43.722 --> 25:48.092
Come on in, Allie.
Can I get you anything?

25:48.126 --> 25:50.895
Never autopsy on an empty
stomach, I always say.

25:50.962 --> 25:51.996
[chuckles]

25:54.900 --> 26:00.337
- Uh, wow.
- What do you mean by that?

26:00.372 --> 26:03.674
I mean...
this office is great.

26:03.742 --> 26:08.612
I love tribal art... especially
ritual masks of West Africa.

26:08.680 --> 26:09.847
You do?

26:09.881 --> 26:11.715
The idea that when you put one on,

26:11.783 --> 26:13.884
you conceptually lose
your human identity

26:13.919 --> 26:16.287
and become the spirit
represented by the mask ...

26:16.354 --> 26:19.223
I mean, it's the definition of cool.

26:19.291 --> 26:20.958
[sighs]

26:20.992 --> 26:23.928
You do not know how relieved
I am to hear you say that.

26:23.962 --> 26:28.899
- Um, why?
- Oh, uh, well, I was ...

26:28.967 --> 26:30.301
I was a little nervous that maybe

26:30.335 --> 26:31.902
we wouldn't have anything in common

26:31.937 --> 26:34.872
and you wouldn't enjoy
hanging out with me. [chuckles]

26:34.906 --> 26:36.173
You were worried about that?

26:36.208 --> 26:39.977
I tried on a few masks
of my own, in fact.

26:40.011 --> 26:41.645
Oh, please.

26:41.680 --> 26:44.081
But, you know, even though
I should know better.

26:44.149 --> 26:47.151
It's ... it's always
best just to be yourself.

26:47.185 --> 26:49.687
- My mom says that.
- I agree with her.

26:49.721 --> 26:53.023
- Easier said than done sometimes.
- Tell me about it.

26:55.894 --> 26:58.162
It's really hard, trying to fit in.

26:58.230 --> 26:59.930
[chuckles]

26:59.965 --> 27:01.799
That's part of the reason that
I spend my day with dead people.

27:03.201 --> 27:04.001
Nice.

27:04.069 --> 27:04.902
[both laugh]

27:04.936 --> 27:06.303
[door buzzes]

27:09.040 --> 27:12.376
B.P.D. got a call about an altercation
involving one of our suspects.

27:12.410 --> 27:14.345
- Do you know what happened?
- Nope.

27:14.379 --> 27:18.282
But if he's being held here,
technically, he's our suspect.

27:18.350 --> 27:20.251
Ooh, isn't he helpful?

27:23.888 --> 27:26.023
You got visitors, counselor.

27:27.892 --> 27:30.261
- You okay, Mr. Wescourt?
- Yeah.

27:30.295 --> 27:31.795
This man works in the D.A.'s office.

27:31.863 --> 27:33.864
He might as well have
had a target on his back.

27:33.898 --> 27:35.399
It's all right.

27:35.433 --> 27:37.067
Why wasn't he put in protective
custody in the first place?

27:37.102 --> 27:39.470
Guess the way we see it,
you kill your girlfriend,

27:39.537 --> 27:41.305
you don't get special treatment.

27:45.944 --> 27:47.845
I'm sorry about this.

27:47.879 --> 27:51.115
Oh, it's the least of my problems.

27:51.149 --> 27:56.120
My lawyer has been calling
Carol nonstop. She...

27:56.187 --> 28:00.280
She won't bail me out.
She won't talk to me.

28:00.825 --> 28:02.860
She's probably pretty confused.

28:02.927 --> 28:06.463
And the phones in my office
go right to voicemail.

28:06.498 --> 28:09.933
My staff have jumped ship.
I'm alone.

28:09.968 --> 28:14.204
Apparently, my only friends are you two.
[chuckles] Put me in here.

28:14.272 --> 28:16.874
Oh, hey, you put yourself
in here when you lied to us.

28:16.908 --> 28:20.744
I didn't kill her!
I was set up.

28:20.779 --> 28:22.413
By who? How?

28:22.480 --> 28:25.983
I don't know!
[groans, exhales sharply]

28:26.017 --> 28:29.153
All I know is that I loved Danni.

28:30.187 --> 28:35.926
And whoever did this to her
is out there while I'm in here.

28:37.962 --> 28:39.530
Look who made bail.

28:43.068 --> 28:45.235
[sighs]

28:47.806 --> 28:51.542
[indistinct shouting]

28:51.576 --> 28:53.977
<i>Korsak: Guess the word is out.
It's a zoo out there.</i>

28:54.012 --> 28:56.246
Ah, the press is calling
him the "cutthroat lawyer,"

28:56.314 --> 28:59.249
- which is factually inaccurate.
- Catchy, though.

28:59.284 --> 29:00.951
I-I think we're gonna
need to put up a barricade.

29:00.985 --> 29:03.253
- Better do it quick.
- Yeah.

29:05.857 --> 29:07.891
Nice job on the bruises.

29:07.926 --> 29:11.895
A lady in processing took pity on me
and loaned me some concealer.

29:11.930 --> 29:14.098
Well, I hope it holds up.
You got a lot of press out there.

29:14.132 --> 29:18.001
[sighs] Poor Carol.

29:19.170 --> 29:21.972
[scoffs] You should have
thought about that before.

29:22.006 --> 29:24.875
Let me ask you something.

29:24.909 --> 29:29.079
Are you as convinced of my
guilt as I am of my innocence?

29:29.114 --> 29:31.348
It's not about my certainty.

29:31.383 --> 29:34.051
It's about evidence,
and it's about facts,

29:34.085 --> 29:36.820
like the fact that you lied
about being in Danni's apartment.

29:36.888 --> 29:39.256
I know how it looks.

29:39.290 --> 29:42.926
But I also know that I am innocent.
[door opens]

29:42.961 --> 29:43.961
[indistinct shouting]
Hey...

29:44.028 --> 29:45.229
Hey! Ho! Ho! Hey!

29:45.296 --> 29:46.463
<i>Get back!</i>

29:46.498 --> 29:48.232
<i>- Man: Mr. Wescourt!
- Woman: There he is!</i>

29:48.266 --> 29:51.180
<i>Did you kill her? Can you tell
us where you were that night?</i>

29:51.215 --> 29:52.136
[indistinct shouting]

29:52.170 --> 29:53.971
<i>Was she your girlfriend?</i>

29:54.005 --> 29:55.973
<i>Can we get a statement?
We just want to ask...</i>

29:56.007 --> 29:57.374
All right, come on.

29:57.409 --> 29:58.864
You can go through the
morgue loading docks.

29:58.899 --> 30:01.512
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Come on.

30:01.579 --> 30:04.381
[elevator button clicks]

30:04.416 --> 30:06.150
[elevator bell dings]

30:11.489 --> 30:14.224
[elevator doors close,
elevator whirring]

30:14.259 --> 30:18.128
All right, what was
Danni's favorite color?

30:18.196 --> 30:22.633
- Uh... sage.
- Sage?

30:22.667 --> 30:25.569
She liked to look at
the pottery barn catalog.

30:25.603 --> 30:27.905
There's a lot of sage in there.

30:27.939 --> 30:30.340
- What was her favorite food?
- Samosas.

30:30.375 --> 30:34.945
- Least-favorite food?
- Shrimp. Okay?

30:38.416 --> 30:41.151
Sorry.

30:41.619 --> 30:45.489
It wasn't a fling.
I loved her.

30:45.523 --> 30:47.491
Well, then, why not
just leave your wife?

30:47.525 --> 30:51.395
I was trying to do the
right thing for everyone.

30:51.463 --> 30:54.097
Oh, I-I know how that sounds.

30:54.132 --> 30:58.268
I just couldn't figure out
an easy way to end things.

31:02.540 --> 31:05.008
Maybe there is no easy way.

31:06.177 --> 31:09.313
Maybe love always ends
with someone getting hurt.

31:09.380 --> 31:10.914
God, I hope not.

31:10.949 --> 31:13.116
[elevator bell dings]

31:13.151 --> 31:16.353
Me, too.
For your sake, anyway.

31:30.868 --> 31:32.302
<i>You still here?</i>

31:32.336 --> 31:34.838
[sighs]
He really loved her, Vince.

31:34.872 --> 31:38.275
Wouln't be the first man
to kill someone he loved.

31:38.309 --> 31:40.410
And we don't have motive.

31:40.478 --> 31:42.479
He's a married man
with a high-profile job.

31:42.513 --> 31:44.414
Motive was probably
what it always is ...

31:44.482 --> 31:46.516
He wanted out, she
threatened to expose him.

31:46.551 --> 31:49.853
But she never even spoke
his name to her friends.

31:49.887 --> 31:52.422
And she encrypted files
with articles about his case.

31:52.457 --> 31:54.791
She wasn't trying to expose
him. She was protecting him.

31:54.826 --> 31:56.493
And look.

31:56.561 --> 31:59.563
He's got a trip to Hawaii for
a legal conference next month.

31:59.597 --> 32:01.865
Three days at the Hyatt.

32:01.899 --> 32:03.734
Mm-hmm, but the plane
ticket is for a week.

32:03.768 --> 32:05.435
Where's he staying the rest of the time?

32:05.503 --> 32:06.870
Check out her credit-card records.

32:06.904 --> 32:09.840
So that's who she was
going on vacation with.

32:09.907 --> 32:12.876
But why book a romantic getaway
with a mistress you're planning to kill?

32:12.910 --> 32:15.612
To make it look like you're
not planning to kill her.

32:15.646 --> 32:20.317
[sighs] Okay, say that's true.
Why kill her this way,

32:20.351 --> 32:23.520
I mean, in the exact manner
of a case he just tried and won?

32:23.554 --> 32:25.689
I mean, if he wanted to
get rid of her that badly,

32:25.723 --> 32:27.891
just shoot her or push her
off a cliff or something.

32:27.925 --> 32:30.227
Well, maybe he's a sociopath
who wanted to get caught.

32:30.261 --> 32:31.561
It just doesn't feel right.

32:31.596 --> 32:35.432
He lied about being in the apartment.
His alibi is full of holes.

32:35.500 --> 32:37.901
His prints were at the crime scene.
It's a lot of evidence.

32:37.935 --> 32:40.504
It's just... too perfect.

32:40.538 --> 32:45.408
I know what the evidence says.
I know what my gut says.

32:45.443 --> 32:46.510
What's that?

32:47.544 --> 32:49.595
Reasonable doubt.

32:54.482 --> 32:57.717
<i>Nina: This is the area between
Danni's apartment and the hotel. </i>

32:57.751 --> 33:01.112
- It's like a mile.
- 9/10 of a mile, to be exact.

33:01.113 --> 33:02.889
Take about 12 minutes to walk.

33:02.923 --> 33:04.724
So he easily could
have parked in the lot,

33:04.758 --> 33:06.592
walked to Danni's apartment, killed her,

33:06.627 --> 33:08.728
and headed back to the
hotel to stay overnight.

33:08.762 --> 33:11.697
Nobody wants your gut to
be right more than I do,

33:11.732 --> 33:14.367
but no matter how many
times we go over it,

33:14.401 --> 33:18.104
- he still looks guilty.
- All right, well, what about the hair?

33:18.138 --> 33:21.073
Can CSRU tell us exactly
how much they found?

33:21.141 --> 33:23.479
We can't say exactly how
much washed away before

33:23.480 --> 33:25.578
we got to it, but that
it was there at all...

33:25.612 --> 33:29.115
- He still looks guilty.
- There's also the fingerprint.

33:30.183 --> 33:33.419
<i>- That's where you got the print?
- It was on the underside of the handle,</i>

33:33.453 --> 33:34.954
which is why they missed
it in the first sweep,

33:35.022 --> 33:38.724
- but it's a complete print.
- Also an exact match.

33:38.759 --> 33:40.393
Can you blow that up?

33:40.427 --> 33:42.094
[keyboard clacking]

33:42.162 --> 33:43.996
[monitor beeps]

33:44.031 --> 33:46.098
We need to get back in that apartment.

33:50.037 --> 33:51.537
Hey.

33:51.572 --> 33:55.374
Guess who, according
to a reliable source,

33:55.409 --> 33:57.944
is the definition of cool?

33:57.978 --> 34:01.447
- Did you give Allie lipstick?
- What?

34:01.515 --> 34:04.083
Her mother said something about
her coming home with makeup on.

34:04.117 --> 34:06.452
Well, Allie mentioned that
a lot of girls in school

34:06.486 --> 34:09.655
- have started wearing makeup.
- Which her mother doesn't allow.

34:09.690 --> 34:13.859
She mentioned that, and, um,
I said that I agree with that rule.

34:13.893 --> 34:17.530
But she is feeling the
pressure just to fit in.

34:17.598 --> 34:21.434
- So you gave her lipstick.
- Lip gloss. Just a little.

34:21.467 --> 34:23.703
And I suggested that she try it on

34:23.737 --> 34:26.438
as a way to broach the subject with you.

34:26.473 --> 34:28.975
But if I've overstepped
my boundaries ...

34:37.117 --> 34:39.085
What was that for?

34:39.119 --> 34:42.154
For a week, I've known
something was bugging her,

34:42.188 --> 34:43.989
and she wouldn't talk to me.

34:44.024 --> 34:47.159
It has been killing me,
not knowing what's going on.

34:47.226 --> 34:51.664
It's hard to talk about.
I remember being the odd man out.

34:51.697 --> 34:53.833
- Mm, I don't believe that.
- Well, believe it.

34:53.867 --> 34:57.870
I was ... I think the
technical term is "weird."

34:57.904 --> 35:00.106
[chuckles]
I kind of like weird.

35:01.608 --> 35:02.796
You're not wearing the lip gloss

35:02.797 --> 35:05.211
- you gave my daughter, are you?
- No.

35:05.245 --> 35:07.013
'Cause that would be a
different kind of weird.

35:07.047 --> 35:08.047
[chuckling] Yeah.

35:09.983 --> 35:13.185
- [laughs] I kind of ruined it.
- Just a little bit.

35:13.220 --> 35:16.155
- Okay. Okay, go.
- Okay.

35:19.126 --> 35:20.960
[sighs]

35:21.028 --> 35:23.996
Reverse-thread nuts are always tricky.

35:24.031 --> 35:26.032
If you turn the wrench
the wrong direction,

35:26.066 --> 35:27.633
you can crack the porcelain.

35:27.668 --> 35:29.802
Sometimes I forget you're
a plumber's daughter.

35:29.836 --> 35:32.571
[metal scraping]

35:32.606 --> 35:35.741
You know, I never thought
I'd say this, but...

35:35.776 --> 35:38.644
thank you, pop.

35:38.679 --> 35:41.147
This handle does not
belong with that toilet.

35:41.181 --> 35:42.548
They're two different brands.

35:42.616 --> 35:45.518
- Maybe the landlord replaced it.
- Yeah, but the newer handles

35:45.552 --> 35:47.053
are usually plastic or stainless steel.

35:47.087 --> 35:50.156
- This one's brass. Look.
- Hmm. Nice.

35:50.190 --> 35:52.158
A little too nice for a
landlord to spend money on.

35:52.192 --> 35:55.895
What if that handle was somewhere else
when Paul Wescourt touched it?

35:55.962 --> 35:57.697
Wouldn't take more than a wrench

35:57.764 --> 36:01.338
- for someone to relocate it here.
- The print was planted.

36:01.373 --> 36:02.568
[sighs]

36:02.602 --> 36:05.104
I'll talk to the super, verify
he didn't replace this handle.

36:05.138 --> 36:09.742
- If you're right ...
- I am. And so was Paul Wescourt.

36:09.776 --> 36:11.844
He was set up.

36:15.716 --> 36:17.583
We have new evidence
in your husband's favor.

36:17.617 --> 36:20.920
- Can you tell us where he is?
- You don't know?

36:20.987 --> 36:22.688
I assumed that's why you're here.

36:22.723 --> 36:24.724
The police are out
looking for him right now.

36:24.758 --> 36:26.158
What do you mean, the police?

36:26.193 --> 36:28.327
How can you not know?
This is all your fault!

36:28.361 --> 36:29.962
Slow down.
Tell us what happened.

36:29.996 --> 36:31.297
I haven't seen him
since you arrested him.

36:31.331 --> 36:33.132
He just keeps leaving
voicemail messages.

36:33.166 --> 36:34.100
He's out of his mind.

36:34.167 --> 36:37.002
All right, all right.
What is he saying in the messages?

36:37.070 --> 36:38.804
[voice breaking]
He's saying that ... that I ...

36:38.839 --> 36:42.074
that I don't deserve this,
that he ... that he failed me.

36:42.109 --> 36:44.810
I-I called the police after this one.

36:44.845 --> 36:46.278
<i>Paul: This is the last
time you'll hear from me.</i>

36:46.313 --> 36:50.049
<i>You'll be better off if I put
an end to this. [keypad beeps]</i>

36:50.083 --> 36:52.017
[crying]
H-He's gonna kill himself.

36:52.085 --> 36:53.819
Not if we can find him first.

36:53.887 --> 36:55.354
[exhales sharply]

37:03.537 --> 37:06.806
Maura, the suicides that
come through your office ...

37:06.840 --> 37:08.574
Can you figure out how
and where they occur?

37:08.609 --> 37:09.909
Most of them.

37:09.943 --> 37:11.444
Okay, can you use that
information to figure out

37:11.512 --> 37:12.812
a place where someone
like Wescourt might try it?

37:12.846 --> 37:14.614
Well, it's not a
straightforward formula.

37:14.648 --> 37:17.517
Was he on medications?
Did he have a history of depression?

37:17.551 --> 37:19.418
The woman he loves is dead.
His marriage is over.

37:19.453 --> 37:20.820
His career is ruined.

37:20.854 --> 37:22.088
I think it's pretty safe
to say the guy's depressed.

37:22.122 --> 37:25.458
Okay, I amplified the ambient noises
from the messages he left.

37:25.492 --> 37:27.827
So far, I've got what
I think is a jet engine.

37:27.861 --> 37:31.731
[computer beeps]

37:31.798 --> 37:35.134
<i>Paul: I'm not gonna drag you
through the humiliation of a trial.</i>

37:35.168 --> 37:37.403
<i>It's time I put an end to this.</i>

37:37.471 --> 37:39.705
[jet engine humming]

37:39.740 --> 37:40.940
He's by an airport.

37:40.974 --> 37:46.512
<i>I-I wish I could be a better man.
You deserve that. [rapid popping]</i>

37:46.580 --> 37:49.549
- That sounds like gunfire to me.
- Gunfire and jet engines.

37:49.583 --> 37:51.817
<i>I just want you to know how sorry I am.</i>

37:51.885 --> 37:53.553
What is that?

37:53.587 --> 37:55.621
<i>This is all my fault.
This is what I deserve.</i>

37:55.656 --> 37:56.923
[indistinct clanging]

37:56.957 --> 37:58.691
What is that?

37:58.725 --> 38:01.160
Could be car tires on steel
grating, maybe a bridge.

38:01.228 --> 38:02.762
[keyboard clacking]

38:02.796 --> 38:05.598
There's a firing range on Moon Island.

38:05.632 --> 38:07.900
The narrows bridge leads straight to it.

38:07.968 --> 38:09.535
[computer beeps]

38:09.570 --> 38:12.071
And it's adjacent to
the flight path at Logan.

38:12.105 --> 38:15.041
Remote bridge ... it's a
perfect spot for a suicide.

38:15.108 --> 38:16.576
You're not going alone.

38:16.610 --> 38:18.945
Well, Korsak and Frankie
are at the courthouse.

38:18.979 --> 38:20.880
Then it's you and me.

38:29.256 --> 38:31.190
That's his car.

38:41.134 --> 38:43.202
<i>Maura, stay here.
I don't want to spook him.</i>

38:43.270 --> 38:44.591
- Jane ...
- No, I know this guy well

38:44.755 --> 38:47.840
- enough to know he's not bluffing.
- Be careful.

38:54.948 --> 38:56.649
Paul?

38:59.953 --> 39:02.722
Paul?

39:02.756 --> 39:07.026
- Listen to me, okay?
- You're wasting your time.

39:07.060 --> 39:09.695
No, just ... just listen.

39:09.763 --> 39:13.899
I know you were set up.
And we can prove it.

39:13.967 --> 39:16.202
[breathing heavily] So?

39:16.236 --> 39:19.905
[sighs] Please w... wait.
Wait. Wait.

39:19.940 --> 39:22.410
Okay, listen.
I-I know that we said

39:22.411 --> 39:25.111
that there's no easy way
to end things, but y...

39:25.145 --> 39:27.980
you can't do this, okay?
You can't quit like this.

39:28.048 --> 39:31.550
I ruined my marriage.
[breathing heavily]

39:31.585 --> 39:34.153
Danni's gone.

39:34.187 --> 39:38.691
- My life's over.
- No. No, it isn't. Okay, j... [sighs]

39:38.725 --> 39:41.227
Just... hang on a second, okay?

39:41.261 --> 39:44.897
- Let me come down there.
- Oh, Jane, don't.

39:44.931 --> 39:46.632
<i>I'll stay over here, all right?</i>

39:46.700 --> 39:48.034
<i>We'll ... we'll ...
we'll just talk from here.</i>

39:48.068 --> 39:51.258
Okay? I'm not ...

39:51.293 --> 39:53.205
I'm not moving any f...
any further, all right?

39:53.273 --> 39:55.174
[sighs]

39:55.208 --> 39:56.909
I know that you think
that your life is over,

39:56.943 --> 39:58.310
and ... and ... and maybe I
can't change your mind on that,

39:58.378 --> 40:01.714
but just ...
please, for one second ...

40:01.748 --> 40:04.215
please, will you just
think about Danielle?

40:06.153 --> 40:09.955
- Danni.
- I know you didn't kill her.

40:09.990 --> 40:11.590
Okay? I ...
[sighs]

40:11.625 --> 40:14.860
I-I think you loved
her more than anything.

40:14.895 --> 40:18.764
And I think that's why you...
you were so conflicted

40:18.799 --> 40:21.693
about what to do.
And that's why you cannot

40:21.694 --> 40:24.770
let whoever did this to her
get away with it, okay?

40:24.805 --> 40:26.338
Come on.

40:26.373 --> 40:29.208
Paul, you said it yourself ...
her killer is still out there.

40:30.777 --> 40:35.014
Look, I... 
[breathes deeply]

40:35.048 --> 40:37.316
I ca... I can't bring Danni back.

40:37.350 --> 40:40.186
Okay? And ... and ...
[breathing heavily]

40:40.253 --> 40:43.222
I can't ... I can't
give you any more nights

40:43.256 --> 40:47.059
flipping through catalogues
and ... and ... and Indian food.

40:47.094 --> 40:52.698
But ... but I can bring her
killer to justice. I can do that.

40:52.733 --> 40:56.035
Okay? Please ... please
h-help me do that.

40:56.069 --> 40:58.037
<i>Doesn't she deserve that?</i>

41:02.075 --> 41:03.275
<i>Come on.</i>

41:03.310 --> 41:05.277
[breathing heavily]

41:08.215 --> 41:09.315
[gasps]

41:09.349 --> 41:10.983
No!

41:20.093 --> 41:20.693
Jane!

41:22.462 --> 41:23.095
Jane!

41:25.465 --> 41:27.066
Jane...

41:29.336 --> 41:30.936
[yelling] Jane!

41:33.874 --> 41:35.374
[yelling] Jane!
