10:45.028 --> 10:46.311
And, um...

10:47.314 --> 10:49.314
...I, I know that I need
to tell him, but...

10:50.367 --> 10:52.651
...I'm just so
worried about, uh...

10:54.037 --> 10:55.453
...What he might do.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.824
How he'll feel.

11:00.877 --> 11:03.828
Oh, baby, I am so sorry.

11:06.866 --> 11:08.833
No, no, I...

11:11.288 --> 11:14.005
You faced your fear.

11:16.727 --> 11:18.326
And you got free.

11:22.499 --> 11:24.466
I have to do the same.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.069
You don't have to do anything.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.322
Every situation is different.

11:32.392 --> 11:35.326
Freedom looks different
for each of us.

11:37.714 --> 11:38.747
[whispering] oh, god.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.516
I know, that's...

11:43.253 --> 11:44.719
[exhales]

11:46.156 --> 11:47.522
[in normal voice]
this could break us.

11:49.876 --> 11:50.859
Look.

11:52.262 --> 11:54.879
You take your time coming out.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.266
You're gonna be okay.

12:00.270 --> 12:01.269
[whispering] okay.

12:03.540 --> 12:04.539
It's gonna be okay.

12:06.176 --> 12:07.175
Take your time.

12:17.287 --> 12:18.903
I wanna thank you
all for this.

12:20.907 --> 12:24.025
I wasn't the most supportive
of this co-op at the start.

12:27.230 --> 12:30.365
Took a long time for me
to come around to things.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.567
I was in my head about things,
thinking about myself.

12:34.454 --> 12:37.055
But now I understand.

12:38.442 --> 12:39.441
I see.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.646
We are stronger together.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.149
I'm just sorry...

12:49.319 --> 12:51.269
...That it took all this
to make me see.

12:55.325 --> 13:00.061
[voice shaking]
you were doing all this
for our farms.

13:00.096 --> 13:02.263
And you ain't even got
your own to hold onto, now.

13:07.771 --> 13:09.471
I'm learning from you,
ralph angel.

13:11.591 --> 13:12.957
Like I learned
from your daddy.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.179
It ain't nothing
better in this world...

13:20.016 --> 13:22.016
...Then calling
a bordelon a friend.

13:26.256 --> 13:27.088
Thank you.

13:28.825 --> 13:30.325
-Yeah, I love you too.
-[camera shutter clicking]

13:30.927 --> 13:32.110
good work, everybody.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.595
-Yes, sir.
-Time to go eat.

13:33.630 --> 13:35.396
I know everybody
waiting for us.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.447
I appreciate it.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.267
[crowd members chattering]

13:39.302 --> 13:40.134
it's happening?

13:42.372 --> 13:44.639
Hey, joaquin,
been meaning to ask you,

13:44.674 --> 13:46.241
man, how's your pops doing?

13:46.276 --> 13:48.042
He taught me everything
I know about farming.

13:51.848 --> 13:52.947
[quietly] thanks.

14:02.375 --> 14:03.658
Hey, benny, man.

14:03.693 --> 14:06.311
Look, I wanna thank you
for talking to joaquin.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.729
We've had it
pretty tough going.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.682
Man, you and miss vi
are doing a solid
for the kids and they family.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.351
These kids, man,
they need our attention,

14:13.887 --> 14:14.886
or by support.

14:14.905 --> 14:16.170
That's real.

14:16.206 --> 14:18.940
I mean, these kids
got way more to process
than we ever did.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.508
[benny] you ain't never lyin'.

14:20.544 --> 14:23.862
I know I'd be a completely
different person if I had
to grow up without a dad.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.196
That's why we gotta
hold 'em close.

14:26.149 --> 14:26.998
That's real.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.368
It was off...

14:38.261 --> 14:39.344
How are you feeling?

14:43.416 --> 14:44.549
Soft...

14:45.769 --> 14:46.768
It's flooding back.

14:50.774 --> 14:53.725
You know, I already dealt
with this in my own way.

14:54.861 --> 14:56.227
I, um, [clearing throat]

14:57.397 --> 14:59.397
I suffered a lot of losses.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.232
Real losses because
of what he did.

15:02.786 --> 15:04.068
And I worked...

15:05.104 --> 15:05.904
...Damn hard...

15:07.207 --> 15:08.623
...To be able to stand up.

15:10.744 --> 15:11.910
And I am standing.

15:13.630 --> 15:15.196
-I'm here.
-Yes.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.031
You are.

15:17.067 --> 15:18.800
Jimmy dale was a horrible man.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.286
And the world is a better
place without him.

15:22.305 --> 15:23.554
Absolutely.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.592
He beat up vi...
He tried to rape me.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.595
And now this... Monster...

15:32.298 --> 15:33.798
...Gets to rest in peace?

15:33.817 --> 15:36.067
Well, I doubt
he'll have peace.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.102
I don't believe that's how
the universe works.

15:38.137 --> 15:41.272
Do you know how many times
in my mind...
That I played this out?

15:43.309 --> 15:44.943
What I may say to him?

15:45.612 --> 15:46.778
I did it for years.

15:49.466 --> 15:50.281
Jimmy dale...

15:51.418 --> 15:53.818
...Was the first man...

15:53.837 --> 15:56.504
...To support my dream
of wanting to be somebody.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.124
He used to call me...

16:01.678 --> 16:03.511
...Billie d. Esquire.

16:04.330 --> 16:05.296
[sighing]

16:07.100 --> 16:08.266
and I loved it.

16:11.170 --> 16:14.956
And then I realized that it
was all a part of
his predator ammo.

16:17.861 --> 16:19.360
And then everything just...

16:21.014 --> 16:21.813
...Warped...

16:22.449 --> 16:23.698
...In my own mind.

16:25.035 --> 16:27.452
And my... My dreams
and my thoughts.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.656
He made 'em feel wrong...

16:33.293 --> 16:34.325
...Stained...

16:35.962 --> 16:36.794
...And then I just...

16:38.048 --> 16:39.998
...Just locked him away.

16:40.800 --> 16:41.916
I threw 'em away.

16:41.968 --> 16:43.001
Just like that.

16:44.004 --> 16:44.836
[nova quietly] say it.

16:46.356 --> 16:47.655
Say it to me.

16:48.558 --> 16:49.674
Say what you tell him.

16:54.731 --> 16:57.148
-You're a thief!
-Good.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.733
You took everything from me.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.736
You took my dreams...

17:02.522 --> 17:03.688
...You took my light...

17:05.175 --> 17:06.858
...You took my trust.

17:08.411 --> 17:10.511
You took everything.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.332
And you don't get
to do that to me...

17:15.535 --> 17:17.035
...And not pay for it.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.921
You gon' have to pay for it!

17:21.207 --> 17:22.090
You hear me?

17:23.993 --> 17:26.744
You don't deserve to see me...

17:26.763 --> 17:29.430
...You don't deserve
what you took from me...

17:32.602 --> 17:35.887
I hope you rot... In... Hell!

17:48.618 --> 17:50.218
[crying]

17:59.729 --> 18:02.530
hey, have you seen
ralph angel?

18:02.582 --> 18:05.283
No, he was right
behind us when we left
mr. Cardale's.

18:05.318 --> 18:06.250
I saw him get in his truck.

18:07.153 --> 18:08.436
Anyone see ralph angel?

18:08.471 --> 18:09.737
[cardale] uh, he couldn't
have gone too far.

18:09.773 --> 18:11.622
He's the one who sat us down
to break for lunch.

18:12.658 --> 18:14.008
So he just slipped away?

18:15.678 --> 18:16.511
[quietly] I don't...

18:17.764 --> 18:18.596
What was that?

18:19.349 --> 18:20.515
-What?
-That!

18:21.167 --> 18:21.966
That squirm...

18:24.437 --> 18:25.636
Look, can I talk to you
for a second?

18:31.861 --> 18:33.644
Um...

18:33.679 --> 18:35.613
Yeah, so I said
that I wouldn't say anything,

18:35.648 --> 18:37.732
but I think that you
deserve to know.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.651
A guy named chase
stopped by the farm
last night.

18:41.854 --> 18:44.489
He was looking for you,
and things got...

18:46.459 --> 18:47.708
Uncle ra beat him pretty bad.

18:48.795 --> 18:49.610
Oh, my...

18:56.152 --> 18:57.852
[beeping]

18:59.339 --> 19:00.855
-[disconnected beeping]
-damn.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.340
The cell towers are...

19:03.876 --> 19:04.692
Darla...

19:05.662 --> 19:07.545
Can I have your keys?

19:07.564 --> 19:09.046
-[hollywood] what's wrong?
-Please, I need your keys.

19:09.065 --> 19:10.431
-Please.
-[violet] okay,
what's happening?

19:10.483 --> 19:12.033
[darla] tell them...

19:12.068 --> 19:14.468
[micah] the guy that hurt
darla showed up
at the farm last night.

19:24.414 --> 19:25.413
Well, he's not here.

19:26.032 --> 19:26.864
His truck's not here.

19:29.919 --> 19:32.003
-[disconnected beeping]
-cell phone lines...

19:34.574 --> 19:35.540
Where else could he be?

19:36.409 --> 19:37.341
What else does he do?

19:38.428 --> 19:39.260
Nothing...

19:40.246 --> 19:41.879
He works and...

19:43.016 --> 19:44.549
...He takes care
of his family.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.385
That's his life.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.189
He thinks about us, and...

19:51.941 --> 19:53.608
...He spends time with us.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.562
And he thinks about this land,
I mean, that's it.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.081
That's who he is.

20:02.418 --> 20:04.402
I don't deserve him.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.405
-Ah, don't say that.
That's not true.
-Yes, it is, because...

20:07.440 --> 20:09.207
[sighing] I keep things
from him,

20:09.242 --> 20:10.708
and it's never the right way.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.077
[hollywood] whenever...

20:13.112 --> 20:17.098
...Either one of you keep
anything from each other,
it's not the right way.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.916
He's had his fair share
of secrets, too.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.301
Not like me.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.804
I mean, even what he did
with the landry's warehouse...

20:24.908 --> 20:25.907
...That was for me.

20:27.110 --> 20:28.092
For his family...

20:28.978 --> 20:30.261
...I mean, I was wrong, but...

20:31.564 --> 20:32.597
...It wasn't like this.

20:34.250 --> 20:35.082
I just...

20:36.786 --> 20:39.620
I cannot outrun my past.

20:39.656 --> 20:42.056
-Yes, you can.
You have been.
-[darla] no, no, I can't.

20:42.091 --> 20:45.960
-It just keeps coming back
and knocking me down.
-But it doesn't keep you down.

20:47.430 --> 20:48.896
Darla, I've seen you
at your worst.

20:49.632 --> 20:50.731
I've seen it bad.

20:51.334 --> 20:52.617
The hard stuff.

20:54.971 --> 20:57.104
I dare to say that I know
you better than anybody else

20:57.140 --> 20:58.673
in this family except for ra.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.424
But I've seen the fight.

21:01.277 --> 21:04.328
I've seen the battle
that you've done

21:04.347 --> 21:06.013
to get you to where
you are right now.

21:07.784 --> 21:09.133
Now, sweetheart...

21:09.168 --> 21:13.120
I've prayed for you
every day...

21:13.156 --> 21:14.855
...Since I came and got you
that night.

21:15.458 --> 21:16.457
And I promise you...

21:18.695 --> 21:19.860
...I always will.

21:26.836 --> 21:27.668
I know.

21:29.005 --> 21:30.004
I needed to hear that.

21:31.607 --> 21:32.440
Come here.

21:34.477 --> 21:35.459
You always will.

21:38.464 --> 21:39.847
[phone buzzing]

21:46.022 --> 21:47.388
he's at the pool.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.582
Can we talk about...

22:17.036 --> 22:18.869
...What happened at the farm
last night?

22:22.542 --> 22:24.175
I guess we have to, right?

22:26.346 --> 22:28.212
I didn't want you
to find out this way.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.016
I didn't' want you
to find out at all.

22:35.355 --> 22:36.520
I thought I could...

22:37.923 --> 22:39.357
...Handle this all on my own.

22:42.928 --> 22:44.612
But clearly I can't deny...

22:47.884 --> 22:49.700
-I'm so sorry--
-don't blame yourself.

22:51.204 --> 22:52.703
Don't blame yourself
for what he did.

22:53.956 --> 22:54.789
Don't do it.

22:56.626 --> 22:58.075
You did your best, right?

23:14.477 --> 23:15.976
What happened last night?

23:17.814 --> 23:19.897
Last night I looked
in the eyes of a man...

23:21.401 --> 23:22.316
...Like my son.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.821
The same man
who assaulted my wife.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.741
If micah wasn't there
to stop me...

23:32.161 --> 23:33.461
...I might've killed him.

23:34.163 --> 23:34.995
No remorse.

23:37.283 --> 23:38.666
Part of me wishes I did.

23:42.588 --> 23:44.121
I should have warned you.

23:45.825 --> 23:49.260
But I really did not think
that he would come here.

23:50.596 --> 23:54.849
I know, I know,
I should've told you
while it was going on.

23:56.252 --> 23:58.552
But this... This all
just happened
like two weeks ago.

23:58.604 --> 23:59.470
Two weeks?

23:59.505 --> 24:01.972
And... I was in d.C.
With blue,

24:02.007 --> 24:04.341
and... And a school friend
saw us,

24:04.360 --> 24:06.427
and put two and two together,
and I... And...

24:06.462 --> 24:08.696
-And she contacted him, I...
-What about blue?

24:11.150 --> 24:12.166
What about blue?

24:18.791 --> 24:19.790
He met blue?

24:19.809 --> 24:22.393
He's never met blue,
blue has no idea.

24:22.428 --> 24:24.728
-How you know?
-Because I know!

24:24.764 --> 24:26.597
My mother's got this
locked down, ralph angel.

24:26.632 --> 24:29.099
I'm not sharing my son
with that man.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.352
-I can't do it.
-You're not gonna have to.

24:31.404 --> 24:33.470
Chase doesn't
want to meet blue.

24:33.489 --> 24:35.406
He just wants this all
to go away.

24:35.441 --> 24:38.475
He has no idea that I never
came looking for him,

24:38.494 --> 24:40.778
that this fell
into my backyard,
like it did his.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.530
And what if that changes?

24:42.582 --> 24:45.482
That's what he says now,
but what if
he wants to meet blue?

24:45.501 --> 24:47.868
Wants to be in his life,
what, am I supposed
to just let the man in?

24:47.920 --> 24:49.620
That venture is never
gonna happen.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.874
-I promise you that will--
-that's not a promise
you can make, darla.

24:53.910 --> 24:55.943
[shouting] a rapist
does not have rights.

24:57.180 --> 25:00.047
A rapist has no legs
to stand on in this situation.

25:00.099 --> 25:01.916
The law don't see him
as a rapist, darla!

25:05.021 --> 25:06.020
Let's be real!

25:09.108 --> 25:11.525
That rage you felt last night?

25:13.196 --> 25:14.695
I have felt that for years.

25:16.032 --> 25:18.199
You think you're the only one
that's wanted to kill him?

25:22.538 --> 25:23.370
I've been there.

25:24.607 --> 25:25.456
But I won't do it.

25:26.859 --> 25:29.376
I will not lower
myself to that,
and neither will you.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.448
But I will get on any stand.

25:35.468 --> 25:37.418
I will go to any newspaper.

25:37.453 --> 25:41.005
I will go to his wife,
to his boss,
and all of his friends,

25:41.040 --> 25:41.839
and I will tell them...

25:42.825 --> 25:43.891
...What he did to me.

25:46.896 --> 25:47.728
I love you, darla...

25:49.348 --> 25:51.015
...But you could barely
handle all this buzz.

25:52.184 --> 25:53.834
Are you sure you wanna
go public with this?

25:54.971 --> 25:56.170
You think that's a good idea?

25:56.656 --> 25:57.488
Yes.

25:58.357 --> 25:59.173
I do.

26:05.364 --> 26:06.914
I have nothing to lose...

26:09.418 --> 26:10.534
...With you by my side.

26:17.677 --> 26:18.659
I'm gonna call him...

26:19.328 --> 26:20.361
...And I need you with me.

26:21.747 --> 26:22.546
I'm always with you.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.382
And I have nothing to lose.

26:32.942 --> 26:34.842
And how are you doing today?

26:36.228 --> 26:38.145
I'm blessed, and you?

26:38.180 --> 26:40.430
I am abundantly blessed
and highly favored,

26:40.449 --> 26:41.749
this I should say so myself.

26:41.784 --> 26:42.750
Well, amen!

26:42.785 --> 26:44.418
Let the church say "amen!"

26:44.453 --> 26:45.703
[all] amen.

26:46.355 --> 26:47.288
It's been a great day.

26:48.074 --> 26:49.206
Now, who wants
to say the grace?

26:49.775 --> 26:50.908
[knocking]

26:52.128 --> 26:53.410
baby, you expecting somebody?

26:53.445 --> 26:54.912
Not that I can think of.

27:00.970 --> 27:01.969
My brother...

27:02.738 --> 27:04.338
Oh, my brother.

27:04.373 --> 27:05.222
-You're here!
-[dante] papa!

27:05.641 --> 27:06.557
Oh, my...

27:06.592 --> 27:07.608
[ignacio]<i> mijo!</i>

27:08.911 --> 27:11.178
[joaquin] I missed you so...
I can't believe you're here.

27:11.230 --> 27:12.413
[ignacio] I love you so much.

27:13.065 --> 27:14.248
[murmuring happily]

27:15.968 --> 27:19.219
sorry for just...
Sure enough, forgive me.

27:19.255 --> 27:22.406
I couldn't get through,
I tried to call,
but cell towers are down.

27:22.441 --> 27:24.274
Ignacio...

27:24.309 --> 27:27.628
Baby, we are just so
happy to see you.

27:29.265 --> 27:30.280
[joaquin] you okay?

27:30.315 --> 27:31.865
-[ignacio] yeah, I'm okay.
-[dante] I love you.

27:31.901 --> 27:33.233
[ignacio] I love you so much.

27:33.269 --> 27:34.952
Everybody come here,
come on, we got enough
food for everybody.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.675
We used to do this too much.

27:42.511 --> 27:43.510
All the time.

27:44.296 --> 27:45.462
I can't believe you remember.

27:46.632 --> 27:48.615
It's the perfect pick me up,
thank you.

27:48.651 --> 27:50.968
We'll let the good times
heal the bad times.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.138
Yeah, I like that.

27:54.173 --> 27:58.225
You know, all week long,
I've been craving
fried onions.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.176
What in the world?

27:59.195 --> 28:00.527
[nova] summer of junior
year, remember?

28:01.614 --> 28:04.281
We always end up
at camille's dad's
burger place?

28:04.316 --> 28:06.116
[billie] ah, camille,
your first love.

28:06.152 --> 28:07.818
Mmm-hmm.

28:07.853 --> 28:10.821
Man, he got tired of you
trying to push a damn
garden burger on the menu.

28:11.457 --> 28:13.006
[laughs]

28:13.042 --> 28:15.492
camille would make me
a grilled cheese
and fried onions.

28:19.498 --> 28:21.331
Now it's all I can
think about. [chuckles]

28:22.501 --> 28:23.751
just the onions?

28:23.803 --> 28:24.718
Not camille?

28:28.174 --> 28:29.890
That summer
changed everything.

28:31.894 --> 28:33.427
I know, but it wouldn't
hurt to call.

28:33.479 --> 28:34.544
Could hurt a lot.

28:34.563 --> 28:36.096
Could feel good too.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.514
I mean, you don't want
anything from her

28:37.549 --> 28:38.649
you're in love with dominic.

28:39.885 --> 28:43.270
And the way that
you handled seeing calvin,

28:43.322 --> 28:45.055
that's a big step
in the right direction

28:45.074 --> 28:46.523
to the woman you want to be,

28:46.558 --> 28:47.741
as opposed to who you were.

28:49.361 --> 28:51.995
And nova, if you're saying
that the summer with her

28:52.031 --> 28:53.563
is the summer
that changed everything,

28:53.582 --> 28:55.833
then why not resolve that too?

28:58.170 --> 28:59.402
Okay, iyanla.

28:59.422 --> 29:00.754
[laughing]

29:02.041 --> 29:03.373
maybe I'll take you up
on that advice.

29:04.260 --> 29:05.509
You're welcome, beloved.

29:05.544 --> 29:06.794
[both chuckle]

29:06.846 --> 29:08.578
oh, you know what?
I need to pick that up.

29:08.597 --> 29:10.214
-Daddy gonna kill me.
-Oh, you're right.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.382
-"we ain't outside."
-right? [laughs]

29:47.052 --> 29:48.252
Hey, mom.

29:49.305 --> 29:50.754
It's a rough day.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.639
Just a rough few days,
but, um...

29:53.776 --> 29:55.092
...I just wanted to call
and tell you that

29:55.127 --> 29:56.143
everybody's okay.

29:57.980 --> 29:59.897
I know this is
way overdue, but...

30:01.484 --> 30:04.268
...I just wanted to say
I'm very sorry about
what I posted.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.738
You know, I know I hurt you

That's the first real food
I've had in months.

30:41.506 --> 30:44.975
Baby, I can't imagine
what you've been through.

30:47.296 --> 30:49.279
It was so painful
not being able
to speak to my kids.

30:51.283 --> 30:53.767
Knowing they were
safe here though...

30:55.821 --> 30:57.321
...You'll never know
what that meant to me.

30:59.124 --> 31:00.457
We were...

31:00.492 --> 31:02.326
We were glad to have him here.

31:03.712 --> 31:04.828
Those boys,

31:05.998 --> 31:07.981
they brought real joy
to our lives.

31:09.501 --> 31:11.718
You have two
remarkable young men.

31:13.889 --> 31:15.205
Ignacio,

31:15.224 --> 31:17.174
let me get you another plate.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.225
Oh, no, no, no.

31:19.061 --> 31:20.427
You've done enough.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.179
Well, I know you're exhausted.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.015
-So you're welcome
-[door opens]

31:25.050 --> 31:27.484
to just change your mind
and stay here.

working on the case

31:29.572 --> 31:31.488
arranged for that motel room
for a few weeks.

31:32.691 --> 31:33.807
It's gonna give me
a little breathing room.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.360
And I just want to be alone
with the boys, you know?

31:36.996 --> 31:39.029
Of course, of course we do.

31:39.064 --> 31:40.614

I suggest you follow them.

that you don't hurt me.

37:01.419 --> 37:03.803
And hollywood is here
to make sure that

37:03.855 --> 37:05.555
ralph angel
doesn't hurt you...

37:06.708 --> 37:08.208
...Unless it's
absolutely necessary.

37:09.177 --> 37:10.193
And violet...

37:10.913 --> 37:12.195
I'm the unknown quantity.

37:12.781 --> 37:14.197
You just never know.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.233
This... All of this

37:16.952 --> 37:17.951
isn't necessary.

37:18.620 --> 37:20.203
I'm a reasonable man.

37:20.239 --> 37:23.406
I'm just trying to protect
my family and my career.

37:23.441 --> 37:25.441
I don't want to be here
just as much as you don't
want me here.

37:25.460 --> 37:27.443
Well, then why did you
keep calling

37:27.462 --> 37:29.279
and harassing me

37:29.298 --> 37:30.497
when I told you
not to call me?

37:30.549 --> 37:31.948
Make sure we're on
the same page.

37:31.967 --> 37:34.334
Bullshit. You're trying
to intimidate me.

37:34.386 --> 37:35.785
What are you doing
at st. Josephine's?

37:35.804 --> 37:36.953
What are you intending?

37:36.972 --> 37:38.454
Make sure this can all
go away.

37:38.473 --> 37:39.923
-How are you gonna do that?
-Talk to you.

37:40.976 --> 37:42.092
Ask you to sign...

37:43.312 --> 37:44.427
...An nda.

37:44.462 --> 37:45.562
I'm not signing anything.

37:46.398 --> 37:47.597
You're the one
who'll be signing,

37:47.632 --> 37:49.449
and it's a whole lot more
than an nda.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.023
[scoffs] paternity rights?

37:57.075 --> 38:00.193
Now, I keep telling you
he's not mine! All right?

38:00.245 --> 38:01.477
This is just
a misunderstanding!

38:01.496 --> 38:03.646
I didn't do anything wrong
then or now!

38:03.665 --> 38:05.115
Then we don't need
a paternity test.

38:05.150 --> 38:07.951
So sign that
and forego any and all

38:07.986 --> 38:09.536
parental rights in perpetuity.

38:09.588 --> 38:10.987
[scoffs]

38:11.006 --> 38:12.122
gladly.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.434
The next one is an emergency
protective order,

38:24.469 --> 38:25.719
keeping you away from me
and my son.

38:25.771 --> 38:27.220
It's good for five days,
while I pursue

38:27.272 --> 38:28.938
a civil harassment order
from the courts.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.506
No, no, no, no courts!

38:30.525 --> 38:32.058
I keep telling you, it's not--

38:32.110 --> 38:33.393
why would I believe
anything you have to say?

38:33.445 --> 38:34.728
You're a liar and a rapist!

38:34.780 --> 38:36.613
-I didn't rape you!
-So you didn't touch me?
You weren't there?

38:36.648 --> 38:38.098
I wasn't the only one!

38:39.534 --> 38:41.334
-[ralph] watch your
damn mouth!
-[hollywood] stop it!

38:41.370 --> 38:43.019
-Watch how you talk to her!
-[hollywood] stop!

38:43.038 --> 38:44.954
Ra! Ra!

38:46.041 --> 38:47.240
Let her just
finish this, okay?

38:47.292 --> 38:49.676
Let darla do what she's doing,

38:50.629 --> 38:52.912
and you just need
to be here for support.

38:52.964 --> 38:54.647
Nobody here likes you.

38:55.550 --> 38:56.816
Finish your paperwork,

38:56.852 --> 38:59.185
and I'll make sure you
get out of here in one piece.

39:07.212 --> 39:08.928
If you say no courts
and mean it,

39:08.980 --> 39:12.515
then the next document is
a civil restraining agreement.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.718
It says that you will
stay away from me,

39:15.737 --> 39:17.187
my children, and my family.

39:18.240 --> 39:20.023
Some states call it
a stay-away order.

39:24.162 --> 39:27.163
And finally on the last page,

39:27.199 --> 39:29.732
there is an agreement
followed by wire instructions

39:29.751 --> 39:32.619
you will be making
a very large donation

39:32.671 --> 39:34.504
to the st. Josephine's
black farmers co-op.

39:36.241 --> 39:38.541
Initial payment, $250,000?

39:39.878 --> 39:42.662
Monthly payments
of $25,000 for 10 years?

39:43.382 --> 39:44.381
That's $3 million.

39:45.350 --> 39:46.582
I ain't gonna agree to that.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.551
Then you'll be seeing me
on national tv
telling my story.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.892
If the first payment
isn't in the account
by the end of the week,

39:55.927 --> 39:59.112
if you miss any payments
of any month...

40:01.099 --> 40:02.282
...Look for me.

40:06.405 --> 40:07.904
You're really gonna
out yourself?

40:09.274 --> 40:10.290
Out myself?

40:12.127 --> 40:13.460
I didn't do anything wrong.

40:15.297 --> 40:16.579
I was a young woman

40:17.399 --> 40:18.915
in a social situation,

40:19.784 --> 40:21.968
who trusted the people
that I was with.

40:24.589 --> 40:25.755
You raped me.

40:26.791 --> 40:29.792
It doesn't matter
if I was high or drunk

40:29.811 --> 40:31.728
or dressed a certain way

40:31.763 --> 40:33.396
or dancing
with you suggestively

40:33.432 --> 40:34.931
or any other crap
you'll try to throw my way.

40:37.986 --> 40:39.152
You did what you did.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.156
And now, I'll make sure
that you pay.

40:46.278 --> 40:47.577
You'd have to prove it.

40:50.916 --> 40:53.199
