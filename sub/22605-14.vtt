WEBVTT

00:05.687 --> 00:08.090
So Jason comes home and tells us

00:08.090 --> 00:11.693
that he is joining the
debate team at school.

00:11.693 --> 00:13.061
We're thrilled.

00:13.062 --> 00:14.362
What better use

00:14.363 --> 00:16.598
of his naturally
argumentative nature, right?

00:16.599 --> 00:17.599
Mmm.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.134
Then...

00:19.135 --> 00:20.969
then he leaves the room,

00:20.970 --> 00:22.771
and Henry turns to me and says,

00:22.772 --> 00:26.074
“Do we really want him
getting better at it?”

00:27.944 --> 00:30.645
I'm sorry, I'm talking
too much about my kids.

00:30.646 --> 00:32.981
Oh, no, because you can't talk
about work, it's understood.

00:32.982 --> 00:35.684
Oh, I can... everybody is.

00:35.685 --> 00:37.719
Ah, you're going before the
House Appropriations Committee

00:37.720 --> 00:39.120
this week, huh?

00:39.121 --> 00:40.430
To defend my budget.

00:40.431 --> 00:43.024
Oh, squaring off with
Chairman Everard Burke.

00:43.025 --> 00:46.127
Mmm, affectionately known on
the Hill as Burke the Ripper.

00:46.128 --> 00:49.998
Every single one of our
outreach programs is under fire.

00:49.999 --> 00:52.634
It's gonna take some fancy footwork.

00:52.635 --> 00:55.103
You'll be fine... you got very fancy feet.

00:55.104 --> 00:57.672
Fancy shoes.

00:57.673 --> 01:00.433
And how's everything else?

01:01.442 --> 01:03.845
Guys, I mean it, how's everything else?

01:03.846 --> 01:04.470
It's fine.

01:04.471 --> 01:06.247
It's great. Thank you
for cooking, by the way.

01:06.248 --> 01:08.024
- Yeah.
- It's a really big treat.

01:08.025 --> 01:08.950
No problem.

01:08.951 --> 01:10.218
I realize it's the only way

01:10.219 --> 01:12.253
to keep spy reunion going.

01:12.254 --> 01:13.821
You and Isabelle don't want to be seen

01:13.822 --> 01:15.688
palling around D.C. hotspots.

01:15.689 --> 01:17.558
Not while you're
investigating Marsh's death.

01:17.559 --> 01:18.893
We're not investigating anything.

01:18.894 --> 01:20.228
- We just can't cook.
- Got it.

01:20.229 --> 01:21.662
All right, let's eat.

01:21.663 --> 01:23.064
Let's.

01:24.032 --> 01:26.466
Ooh, ow.

01:27.034 --> 01:28.903
- Bear up the bum.
- Aw...

01:28.904 --> 01:30.371
- I'm sorry.
- Very sweet.

01:30.372 --> 01:32.006
I didn't do the toy sweep.

01:32.007 --> 01:33.908
Mmm, too bad we couldn't see the kids.

01:33.909 --> 01:36.176
Are they with their dad tonight?

01:38.079 --> 01:40.081
They are.

01:40.082 --> 01:41.782
All week.

01:41.783 --> 01:43.751
Every week.

01:43.752 --> 01:44.752
What?

01:44.753 --> 01:47.355
I just lost custody.

01:47.356 --> 01:48.823
Wha... how?

01:48.824 --> 01:49.824
What?

01:49.825 --> 01:50.791
Why?

01:50.792 --> 01:52.960
The judge decided

01:52.961 --> 01:57.331
that I have a demanding
and high-risk occupation.

01:57.332 --> 01:58.999
- Oh.
- They're better off with their father,

01:59.000 --> 02:00.401
- a banker.
- Come on.

02:00.402 --> 02:01.678
He literally has banker's hours.

02:01.679 --> 02:03.003
Oh, that's outrageous.

02:03.004 --> 02:05.673
Come on, there has to
be some kind of recourse?

02:07.042 --> 02:08.508
I'll keep fighting it.

02:08.509 --> 02:10.477
It's just gonna drag on forever.

02:10.478 --> 02:11.845
I'm so sorry.

02:11.846 --> 02:13.047
Is there anything we can do?

02:13.048 --> 02:15.082
You know a guy with a baseball bat?

02:15.083 --> 02:17.516
Several, in fact.

02:19.086 --> 02:21.054
Out of the three of us,

02:21.055 --> 02:24.224
it's not like it was a
big competition for me.

02:24.225 --> 02:25.659
- Good-bye.
- I love you.

02:25.660 --> 02:26.693
You're always welcome.

02:26.694 --> 02:27.694
Thank you.

02:27.695 --> 02:28.695
Bye.

02:31.332 --> 02:32.366
That was rough.

02:32.367 --> 02:34.268
That was rough.

02:34.269 --> 02:35.802
- Poor Juliet.
- Mmm.

02:35.803 --> 02:38.205
What's going on with the Marsh case?

02:38.206 --> 02:40.274
Have you brought the CIA in yet?

02:40.275 --> 02:41.908
Munsey's on it.

02:41.909 --> 02:43.277
I'll keep in touch.

02:43.278 --> 02:45.311
- Love you.
- Love you.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:57.591 --> 02:59.192
Really?

02:59.193 --> 03:00.794
The budget is this long?

03:00.795 --> 03:04.164
No, that's just a summary
of your talking points.

03:04.165 --> 03:05.821
The Appropriations Committee's a snake pit.

03:05.822 --> 03:07.111
You can never be too prepared.

03:07.112 --> 03:08.375
Especially when it's being led

03:08.376 --> 03:10.641
by your old friend, Everard Burke.

03:10.642 --> 03:12.929
Let me guess, he's gunning
for the Microloan program.

03:12.930 --> 03:13.573
Exactly.

03:13.574 --> 03:15.542
Burke hates anything that
smacks of a government giveaway.

03:15.543 --> 03:16.876
These loans are an easy target.

03:16.877 --> 03:19.279
Even if we get that money back?

03:19.280 --> 03:21.313
I mean, what part of the word
“loan” does he not understand?

03:21.314 --> 03:22.439
Loans equal liability.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.684
It doesn't help that you're
increasing its budget next year.

03:24.685 --> 03:26.319
Are you saying Chairman
Burke doesn't like me?

03:26.320 --> 03:27.353
Chairman Burke hates you.

03:27.354 --> 03:28.488
Well, don't sugarcoat it.

03:28.489 --> 03:29.823
And why?

03:29.824 --> 03:31.758
Because I can out-drive him off the tee?

03:31.759 --> 03:33.827
Because of your polling numbers.

03:33.828 --> 03:35.762
Your approval ratings are
higher than the president's.

03:35.763 --> 03:37.196
Everybody hates a winner.

03:37.197 --> 03:38.665
Now, see, I thought that saying...

03:38.666 --> 03:40.400
expression... I thought
it was the opposite.

03:40.401 --> 03:43.435
As your policy advisor, I'm
advising you to cut the program.

03:43.436 --> 03:45.805
- Strongly advising.
- Duly noted, Jay.

03:45.806 --> 03:47.373
- Thank you.
- Ma'am, I disagree.

03:47.374 --> 03:49.375
It's one of our most promising programs.

03:49.376 --> 03:51.077
I mean, by providing
small low-interest loans,

03:51.078 --> 03:53.413
we've turned thousands of
women into entrepreneurs.

03:53.414 --> 03:55.481
Prosperity reduces conflict.

03:55.482 --> 03:58.985
Which I think I'm safe in saying
is the whole point of diplomacy.

03:58.986 --> 04:01.587
And that's scripted in your talking points.

04:01.588 --> 04:03.823
All Burke cares about is
the number on the page.

04:03.824 --> 04:06.292
You're not gonna sway him with a
Kumbaya moment. Cut the program.

04:06.293 --> 04:07.426
It'll knock the wind out of his sails,

04:07.427 --> 04:09.262
and the rest of the
budget will fly through.

04:09.263 --> 04:10.763
I know it sounds bloodless,

04:10.764 --> 04:12.198
but you're not gonna
survive your first budget

04:12.199 --> 04:14.634
getting decimated in a public hearing.

04:14.635 --> 04:15.835
Ma'am, Jay has a point.

04:15.836 --> 04:17.168
We have to look at the bigger picture.

04:17.170 --> 04:20.139
Is it reasonable to risk the whole budget

04:20.140 --> 04:21.673
for a single program.

04:21.675 --> 04:23.442
Yes, it is, please don't give up on this.

04:23.443 --> 04:24.944
- We can win it.
- Can we?

04:24.945 --> 04:26.212
Give me an argument, let me hear it.

04:26.213 --> 04:27.246
Gladly... Nhung Chuang.

04:27.247 --> 04:29.215
With a $200 loan,

04:29.216 --> 04:32.685
she organized her entire village
into an agricultural co-op.

04:32.686 --> 04:34.386
Three years ago,

04:34.387 --> 04:36.222
they were surviving off
of government subsidies.

04:36.223 --> 04:38.023
Now they're self-sufficient.

04:38.024 --> 04:40.025
And for the first time,
sending their kids to school.

04:40.026 --> 04:41.694
And there are a thousand other stories

04:41.695 --> 04:43.596
just like hers.

04:43.597 --> 04:45.664
Bring her to the hearing as your guest.

04:45.665 --> 04:47.366
- Oh, c-come on.
- I mean, her testimonial could be

04:47.367 --> 04:48.834
- very powerful. - Does she even have
command of the language?

04:48.835 --> 04:51.070
- I-I doubt it. - Has she ever
even been outside of the village?

04:51.071 --> 04:52.738
- Come on.
- I mean, is she gonna suddenly turn

04:52.739 --> 04:54.339
into William Jennings Bryan

04:54.340 --> 04:55.674
in front of Congressmen and TV cameras?

04:55.675 --> 04:57.476
- No.
- Jay.

04:57.477 --> 04:59.511
Your passion has crossed
over into defeatism.

04:59.512 --> 05:01.579
And it's annoying.

05:02.981 --> 05:04.783
I apologize, ma'am.

05:04.784 --> 05:07.152
I want her as my guest at the hearing.

05:07.153 --> 05:08.654
Put her on a plane,

05:08.655 --> 05:10.055
get her a translator,

05:10.056 --> 05:11.824
prep her as best you can.

05:11.825 --> 05:15.926
We may lose this one, but
we will go down swinging.

05:16.561 --> 05:18.196
Hey, Jay,

05:18.197 --> 05:20.132
your frustration is duly noted.

05:20.133 --> 05:23.033
But this is what we're
doing, so get on board, okay?

05:24.669 --> 05:27.071
I serve at the pleasure, Madam Secretary.

05:27.706 --> 05:29.808
Yes, you do.

05:29.809 --> 05:31.776
Ah, ah, ah, that's... I can... pass that.

05:31.777 --> 05:33.812
Sweetie, what are you doing
just pushing your food around?

05:33.813 --> 05:35.514
We agreed... I cook one night a week,

05:35.515 --> 05:36.982
and we all just get through it.

05:36.983 --> 05:38.216
- It's good.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

05:38.217 --> 05:39.684
I'm just worried about my history test.

05:39.685 --> 05:40.919
- Why?
- What? I quizzed you.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.120
You know your stuff.

05:42.121 --> 05:43.655
Yeah, I know,

05:43.656 --> 05:45.524
but I have this weird
thing on the actual test,

05:45.525 --> 05:46.958
I just... I completely freeze up.

05:46.959 --> 05:48.530
Yeah, it's called not being good at school.

05:48.531 --> 05:49.494
That's not helpful.

05:49.495 --> 05:51.029
And yet my GPA is higher than yours.

05:51.030 --> 05:52.731
Yeah, that's because I don't apply myself.

05:53.733 --> 05:55.000
Oh, like that's some secret.

05:55.001 --> 05:56.368
You've seen it on every report card.

05:56.369 --> 05:57.836
Okay, you know what, go upstairs, study.

05:57.837 --> 05:59.437
We'll clean up.

05:59.438 --> 06:00.572
No, I have homework, too.

06:00.573 --> 06:02.440
- All right. Fine, go. Go apply yourself.
- Okay.

06:02.441 --> 06:03.975
Oh, geez.

06:03.976 --> 06:05.643
Are you done?

06:05.644 --> 06:07.745
Yeah.

06:07.746 --> 06:09.380
See, if you were back in school,

06:09.381 --> 06:10.815
you'd get out of clean up, too.

06:10.816 --> 06:13.618
Hilarious, Dad.

06:13.619 --> 06:16.120
So are you all prepared

06:16.121 --> 06:18.456
- to testify before Congress tomorrow?
- I've been practicing

06:18.457 --> 06:21.492
in front of the mirror, and
apparently I do this a lot.

06:21.493 --> 06:23.161
Which they say makes me look angry and old.

06:23.162 --> 06:25.495
Why didn't you guys tell me about it?

06:26.064 --> 06:27.765
Yes.

06:27.766 --> 06:29.600
- Baby, it's cute, it's cute.
- I'm gonna try and stop it.

06:29.601 --> 06:31.002
- No, it's not cute.
- I like it.

06:31.003 --> 06:32.270
- I do.
- You... that's... you're not

06:32.271 --> 06:34.305
the right guy to ask, I know better.

06:34.306 --> 06:35.606
Seriously, though, I mean,

06:35.607 --> 06:37.875
how-how can they cut
the Microloan program?

06:37.876 --> 06:39.444
Politicians are always yelling

06:39.445 --> 06:41.112
about how they need to get

06:41.113 --> 06:42.814
the developing world off their payroll.

06:42.815 --> 06:44.582
And yet they're not willing

06:44.583 --> 06:46.717
to give people a leg up that they need

06:46.718 --> 06:48.386
when they're starting their own businesses?

06:48.387 --> 06:50.221
It's like, it's not just people, too.

06:50.222 --> 06:51.656
I mean, it's women, it's disgusting.

06:51.657 --> 06:53.291
Well, that's what I intend to tell them.

06:53.292 --> 06:55.726
Without actually calling them disgusting.

06:55.727 --> 06:57.428
Or knitting your brow.

06:57.429 --> 06:59.030
But, honestly, sweetheart, can we just talk

06:59.031 --> 07:00.464
about the school thing, please.

07:00.465 --> 07:02.400
Mom, we're not getting into that.

07:02.401 --> 07:05.102
The deadline for reapplying
to Lovell is coming up.

07:05.103 --> 07:06.971
Well, it doesn't have to
be Lovell, it's the deadline

07:06.972 --> 07:08.639
- for-for any college.
- Oh... my God.

07:08.640 --> 07:09.840
Uh...

07:09.841 --> 07:11.242
It's a good time to talk about it.

07:11.243 --> 07:12.877
Since when did you guys become so obsessed

07:12.878 --> 07:14.345
- with college education?
- All right.

07:14.346 --> 07:15.946
Speaking for myself, it was about the time

07:15.947 --> 07:18.949
I decided to be a college educator.

07:18.950 --> 07:21.785
So all of these guys that
you're about to testify to,

07:21.786 --> 07:24.255
the ones who are, you know,
holding the sword of Damocles

07:24.256 --> 07:27.224
over the heads of women
trying to better themselves,

07:27.225 --> 07:29.326
they all have college educations.

07:29.327 --> 07:30.461
- Right?
- Right, but...

07:30.462 --> 07:31.942
I rest my case.

07:33.464 --> 07:36.433
Okay, but that the sword
of Damocles reference,

07:36.434 --> 07:38.535
I bet you learned that in college.

07:38.536 --> 07:39.703
No, that was probably high school.

07:39.704 --> 07:42.406
Really? Damn it.

07:42.407 --> 07:44.641
Just let her cool her heals,
I'll talk to her this week.

07:44.642 --> 07:46.677
Oh, yes, the Stevie Whisperer.

07:46.678 --> 07:48.111
I'm not saying that.

07:48.112 --> 07:49.646
I'm saying it.

07:49.647 --> 07:51.615
Doesn't bother me that
she always listens to you

07:51.616 --> 07:53.483
- and never listens to me.
- Now, come on.

07:53.484 --> 07:55.219
Just make sure she listens to you.

07:55.220 --> 07:57.821
I will be the Whisperer of Damocles.

07:57.822 --> 08:00.222
Hmm.

08:03.026 --> 08:05.595
We fully recognize the nature

08:05.596 --> 08:08.298
of the terrorist threat,
so despite the lack

08:08.299 --> 08:10.667
of a coherent administration strategy,

08:10.668 --> 08:12.068
this committee is willing to authorize

08:12.069 --> 08:13.737
additional security funds.

08:13.738 --> 08:14.738
Thank you.

08:14.739 --> 08:16.506
I very much appreciate

08:16.507 --> 08:20.010
your thoughtful and substantive
consideration on these issues.

08:20.011 --> 08:21.378
You're welcome.

08:21.379 --> 08:23.346
I'll now turn the floor
back to Chairman Burke.

08:23.347 --> 08:25.315
Thank you. Uh, Madam Secretary,

08:25.316 --> 08:28.251
I'd like to call your attention
to the Microloan program.

08:28.252 --> 08:30.353
For the next fiscal year,
you have increased the budget

08:30.354 --> 08:31.855
by 30 percent.

08:31.856 --> 08:33.623
- That's a big jump.
- It's 30 percent.

08:33.624 --> 08:35.625
You've, uh, shifted funds away

08:35.626 --> 08:37.693
from the Cotton Advisory Committee,

08:37.695 --> 08:39.261
and the Tropical Tuna Commission.

08:39.263 --> 08:40.530
Uh, you've clearly made this a priority.

08:40.530 --> 08:42.532
Yes, I have.

08:42.533 --> 08:44.834
And in deciding, uh, which
programs to prioritize,

08:44.835 --> 08:47.060
I assume you also look into
how well they're managed.

08:47.061 --> 08:47.771
Of course.

08:47.772 --> 08:50.807
We have a rigorous selection process.

08:50.808 --> 08:55.178
The program currently has a
success rate of over 96 percent.

08:55.179 --> 08:58.081
Each one of these loans has the power

08:58.082 --> 09:00.516
to change lives and families.

09:00.517 --> 09:03.319
And in some cases, entire villages.

09:03.320 --> 09:06.255
I have brought with me today
as a guest to the hearing

09:06.256 --> 09:09.559
the woman who embodies the
full potential of this program.

09:09.560 --> 09:10.893
Ms. Chuang.

09:10.894 --> 09:12.929
Uh, we won't be calling you today.

09:12.930 --> 09:17.467
Tell me, who exactly is in
charge of the Microloan grants?

09:17.468 --> 09:20.103
That would be Miles Pendergraff,

09:20.104 --> 09:22.529
he's the Director of the Office
of Development and Finance.

09:22.530 --> 09:23.306
You're correct.

09:23.307 --> 09:26.174
I would like to submit these
photographs for the record.

09:27.743 --> 09:30.503
Please, Madam Secretary,
take a look at these.

09:34.884 --> 09:38.988
Do you recognize the man in these photos?

09:38.989 --> 09:41.857
That would be Mr. Pendergraff.

09:41.858 --> 09:44.060
Those pictures were taken
from a surveillance camera

09:44.061 --> 09:47.329
at the Gold Leaf Casino in Atlantic City.

09:47.330 --> 09:51.700
Do you find his behavior here acceptable?

09:51.701 --> 09:55.371
Well, it is certainly distasteful.

09:55.372 --> 09:57.806
What Mr. Pendergraff
does in his private life

09:57.807 --> 09:59.241
is his own business.

09:59.242 --> 10:03.544
Not if he is gambling
with tax-payer funds.

10:04.980 --> 10:06.081
That's right.

10:06.082 --> 10:07.750
Over the past few months,

10:07.751 --> 10:10.386
thanks to the work of this
committee, investigators

10:10.387 --> 10:12.087
from the Government Accountability Office

10:12.088 --> 10:15.457
have uncovered evidence
that Mr. Pendergraff

10:15.458 --> 10:18.627
has been embezzling State Department money.

10:18.628 --> 10:20.562
Setting up dozens

10:20.563 --> 10:22.431
of fraudulent microloans

10:22.432 --> 10:25.567
to pay for his colorful lifestyle.

10:25.568 --> 10:30.205
And I think it is just
the tip of the iceberg.

10:30.206 --> 10:32.140
So, Madam Secretary,

10:32.141 --> 10:33.909
tell me,

10:33.910 --> 10:37.711
do you still support the Microloan program?

10:41.365 --> 10:47.468
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

10:57.050 --> 10:59.183
So, I mean, could this
whole thing be getting blown

10:59.184 --> 11:00.860
- out of proportion?
- Not if it's a symptom

11:00.861 --> 11:02.294
of a wider abuse.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.896
I mean, the brazen nature
of this embezzlement...

11:03.897 --> 11:05.598
Yes, sir.

11:05.599 --> 11:07.066
I-I am so sorry.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.568
It's... I-I really...

11:09.569 --> 11:12.004
I'm gonna do everything
I can to make this right.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.572
- I'm counting on it.
- Yes, sir.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.007
Good night.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.976
Good night, sir.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.877
Well, that was fun.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.681
Nothing says sweet dreams

11:22.682 --> 11:25.017
like being eviscerated by the president.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.418
Oh, he'll get over it.

11:26.419 --> 11:27.720
Well, he shouldn't.

11:27.721 --> 11:28.854
I really messed up.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.389
No, your staff messed up.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.724
Well, they're my staff.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.792
Okay.

11:33.793 --> 11:36.335
You don't think they're my
staff because I didn't hire them?

11:36.336 --> 11:38.220
I mean, they are my staff,
and I want to stand by them.

11:38.221 --> 11:39.446
Look, you have to do
what's best for the office,

11:39.447 --> 11:40.793
not some individual person.
I have to stand by them.

11:40.794 --> 11:41.600
Will you turn this off?

11:41.601 --> 11:42.935
I-I tried before.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.570
You wouldn't let me.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.872
Well, I'm gonna let you now.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.509
Come here.

11:50.510 --> 11:53.412
Just sleep, okay?

11:53.413 --> 11:55.047
You'll know what to do in the morning.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.382
Yeah, I will.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.418
Okay.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.951
Okay.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.024
- Is it your view...
- What? No.

12:06.025 --> 12:08.026
- Five more minutes, please.
- I just want to, yeah.

12:08.027 --> 12:10.629
...that Secretary McCord was
aware of this level of corruption?

12:10.630 --> 12:12.931
Secr... You said level of corruption, yes?

12:12.932 --> 12:14.266
Yes.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.567
How could she not be?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.836
This is about as shameless as it gets.

12:17.837 --> 12:20.605
You know, I honestly think
this speaks to a larger defect

12:20.606 --> 12:22.707
in the moral character
of the State Department

12:22.708 --> 12:25.977
under her leadership. How...

12:25.978 --> 12:28.913
Burke had congressional investigators

12:28.914 --> 12:30.749
do the dirty work for him.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.018
Apparently, they were going up
and down the whole department.

12:33.019 --> 12:35.220
- Pendergraff never told us...
- Because he didn't want to get fired.

12:35.221 --> 12:37.789
Done. I want all of his files
seized and brought to the DOJ.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.157
- Next?
- In a stroke

12:39.158 --> 12:41.059
of irony that would teach Alanis Morissette

12:41.060 --> 12:42.994
once and for all the
true meaning of irony...

12:42.995 --> 12:44.128
Jesus. Really?

12:44.129 --> 12:45.730
Excuse me, ma'am.

12:45.731 --> 12:46.931
The problem is budget cuts.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.166
The office of the inspector general

12:48.167 --> 12:50.034
has been whittled down to the bone.

12:50.035 --> 12:51.803
- Which is not an excuse
- The malfeasance is not

12:51.804 --> 12:53.404
- for the oversight.
- the important thing; we can fix

12:53.405 --> 12:54.772
- the Microloan plan.
- No.

12:54.773 --> 12:55.940
We have to eliminate it.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.408
Are you really willing

12:57.409 --> 12:59.377
to stake your whole career on this program?

12:59.378 --> 13:01.079
Because this was about
much more than policy.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.680
This was a takedown.

13:02.681 --> 13:04.710
He's right; Burke had
this in his back pocket.

13:04.711 --> 13:05.917
He's angling for you, ma'am.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.118
Unfortunately, he has a reputation

13:07.119 --> 13:08.386
for being very effective at this game.

13:08.387 --> 13:09.587
Remember Max Cantor?

13:09.588 --> 13:10.922
The guy who was nominated

13:10.923 --> 13:12.123
for director of ICE?

13:12.124 --> 13:13.491
He withdrew because two days

13:13.492 --> 13:14.759
before the hearings, Burke found out that

13:14.760 --> 13:15.993
his tree trimmer was an illegal alien.

13:15.994 --> 13:17.495
How about Louise Campos?

13:17.496 --> 13:19.464
- That's right.
- The congresswoman from Nebraska.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.132
- Same thing. - 'Cause she was
having an affair with the staffer.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.400
Burke was chairman of the ethics committee.

13:22.401 --> 13:24.168
- Ethics, of all things.
- He sent pictures

13:24.169 --> 13:25.836
and sent them to every
voter in the district.

13:25.837 --> 13:27.204
I get that this is a disaster.

13:27.205 --> 13:28.639
What I still don't get is how

13:28.640 --> 13:33.109
everybody in this room missed it.

13:33.944 --> 13:36.080
Madam Secretary, it's 1:00.

13:36.081 --> 13:37.548
Your car is here.

13:37.549 --> 13:39.283
Um, I wasn't aware

13:39.284 --> 13:41.185
you had an appointment
outside of the office.

13:41.186 --> 13:42.353
Due respect,

13:42.354 --> 13:43.454
I think we're in the middle

13:43.455 --> 13:44.688
of a very important issue.

13:44.689 --> 13:46.123
You are so right about that, Jay.

13:46.124 --> 13:48.325
And I have a plan; I'm bringing someone in

13:48.326 --> 13:49.560
to consult on this matter.

13:49.561 --> 13:51.228
Someone who can explain to me

13:51.229 --> 13:53.330
why my entire staff

13:53.331 --> 13:54.865
let me hang myself

13:54.866 --> 13:56.133
in front of a nationally televised

13:56.134 --> 13:59.503
congressional hearing.

13:59.504 --> 14:01.437
Trust me, help is on the way.

14:06.677 --> 14:08.812
I don't understand this whole kale thing.

14:08.813 --> 14:10.981
It used to grow wild in the
backyard when I was a kid.

14:10.982 --> 14:13.250
Now it's the basis for a $20 salad.

14:13.251 --> 14:14.385
What's the matter with spinach?

14:14.386 --> 14:16.553
What did spinach do wrong?

14:16.554 --> 14:19.857
The Mircoloans program
should've actually be canceled.

14:19.858 --> 14:22.558
Spinach needs a PR person.

14:24.428 --> 14:25.529
How is that kale?

14:25.530 --> 14:26.763
Fine.

14:26.764 --> 14:29.333
Dad.

14:29.334 --> 14:32.402
I'm not going back to college.

14:32.403 --> 14:33.971
Okay, I just want to make sure that you're

14:33.972 --> 14:35.205
keeping everything in perspective.

14:35.206 --> 14:36.540
I can't let you derail your life

14:36.541 --> 14:37.774
just to prove your autonomy.

14:37.775 --> 14:39.610
What am I, 12?

14:39.611 --> 14:41.878
- I wouldn't do that.
- Then tell me what your plan is.

14:41.879 --> 14:43.273
Tell me what you're passionate about.

14:43.274 --> 14:45.282
Okay, you get

14:45.283 --> 14:46.950
that you're privileged to be in a position

14:46.951 --> 14:49.152
to find yourself,

14:49.153 --> 14:50.287
that you have the means...

14:50.288 --> 14:52.689
That is so reductive.

14:52.690 --> 14:54.391
You've got to get serious about your life,

14:54.392 --> 14:56.860
otherwise I'm afraid
you're just gonna drift.

14:56.861 --> 14:58.228
You don't want to be a hostess; I get that.

14:58.229 --> 15:00.964
But you need to find what you're into,

15:00.965 --> 15:02.764
figure out what matters to you.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.436
Okay.

15:06.437 --> 15:08.770
I care about microloans.

15:10.206 --> 15:12.075
Maybe I could volunteer

15:12.076 --> 15:14.177
at the... for the program.

15:14.178 --> 15:15.779
This isn't defiance?

15:15.780 --> 15:17.414
Sidling up to an organization

15:17.415 --> 15:18.982
that's mired up in controversy,

15:18.983 --> 15:20.383
that's causing global embarrassment

15:20.384 --> 15:21.851
for your mother? That's not...

15:21.852 --> 15:24.821
No, I, no, I cared about
microloans before that.

15:24.822 --> 15:27.056
Besides, I mean...

15:27.057 --> 15:29.259
given their current situation,

15:29.260 --> 15:31.127
they could probably
actually use a lot of help.

15:31.128 --> 15:32.562
Fine.

15:32.563 --> 15:34.497
Go help them.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.132
Fine.

15:36.133 --> 15:38.800
I will.

15:39.602 --> 15:42.003
Thanks for lunch.

15:50.012 --> 15:52.715
A few hours ago, we got
a hit on Samila Mahdavi,

15:52.716 --> 15:54.550
the Iranian national who was last seen

15:54.551 --> 15:56.118
withdrawing money from Marsh's account.

15:56.119 --> 15:57.653
We found her holed up

15:57.654 --> 16:00.289
in an abandoned Iranian
safe house in Istanbul.

16:00.290 --> 16:02.425
So, what's our next move?

16:02.426 --> 16:03.826
Bringing Samila in.

16:03.827 --> 16:05.127
Small team of highly skilled

16:05.128 --> 16:06.595
black op guys go in,

16:06.596 --> 16:08.998
secure her, transport her
to a clandestine location

16:08.999 --> 16:10.566
- for questioning.
- Are we talking

16:10.567 --> 16:12.134
- about a street grab?
- Yes, ma'am.

16:12.135 --> 16:13.502
Intel is that she moves freely

16:13.503 --> 16:14.937
around the neighborhood,
but mostly at night.

16:14.938 --> 16:16.305
It's only about a six-block radius,

16:16.306 --> 16:18.140
and she has something of a routine,

16:18.141 --> 16:19.675
so it's not a high degree
of difficulty for us.

16:19.676 --> 16:20.810
Turkey's a NATO ally

16:20.811 --> 16:22.278
and mounting an off-the-books ops

16:22.279 --> 16:24.380
on their street without alerting them

16:24.381 --> 16:26.182
isn't exactly a friendly move.

16:26.183 --> 16:28.717
We may have to get into it at
a higher level if it goes wrong.

16:28.718 --> 16:30.252
Let's worry about it then.

16:30.253 --> 16:32.087
- You willing to take the risk?
- To find out

16:32.088 --> 16:33.689
who had the secretary
of state killed and why,

16:33.690 --> 16:36.559
yeah, I think it's worth rolling the dice.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.459
You can proceed.

16:37.460 --> 16:39.562
Thank you.

16:39.563 --> 16:42.364
I'm sure it goes without
saying that the president

16:42.365 --> 16:44.533
wants this Microloan thing put to bed

16:44.534 --> 16:46.982
- before it gets any bigger.
- We're in complete agreement about that.

16:46.983 --> 16:49.505
I hear you're bringing Mike B
in to help clean up the mess.

16:49.506 --> 16:51.540
Nothing gets by you.

16:51.541 --> 16:53.008
Got it.

16:53.009 --> 16:55.077
He's the right son of a bitch for the job.

16:55.078 --> 16:56.812
- You know him?
- Yeah.

16:56.813 --> 16:58.480
We taught together at UVA.

16:58.481 --> 16:59.915
I almost feel sorry for your staff.

16:59.916 --> 17:01.650
Well, a little cold terror

17:01.651 --> 17:04.252
over job security never hurt anyone.

17:04.253 --> 17:07.887
You should have that
embroidered on a pillow.

17:19.568 --> 17:21.435
Good afternoon. Is she in?

17:21.436 --> 17:22.771
I'm sorry, you are...

17:22.771 --> 17:24.506
Michael Barnow. This is Gordon.

17:24.507 --> 17:25.707
You must be Blake.

17:25.708 --> 17:27.375
Uh, yes, um...

17:27.376 --> 17:29.344
- I don't have... Wait a minute.
- She knows I'm coming.

17:29.345 --> 17:31.913
Uh, this is not a
dog-friendly environment.

17:31.914 --> 17:34.182
- It's okay; he's not sensitive.
- No, no, no,

17:34.183 --> 17:36.195
I'm sorry, you can go in there.
That-That's not... No, sir.

17:36.196 --> 17:37.586
I don't know who-who let you up here.

17:37.587 --> 17:39.187
Oh. Whoa.

17:39.188 --> 17:40.455
- Ma'am, I don't know...
- Mike B! - Hi.

17:40.456 --> 17:41.856
You came. Oh, my God.

17:41.857 --> 17:43.925
- And you brought Gordon. Wow.
- Of course.

17:43.926 --> 17:45.360
Come on in, take a seat.

17:45.361 --> 17:47.295
Um, do you want, uh, coffee, tea, anything?

17:47.296 --> 17:49.731
Oh, yeah, a Black Eye from
Otis Beanery would be great.

17:49.732 --> 17:51.800
Black Eye from Otis Beanery, you got it?

17:51.801 --> 17:54.167
- Thanks, bye.
- Hey!

17:57.272 --> 17:59.207
Did we just witness Mike B

17:59.208 --> 18:01.276
going into the secretary's office?

18:01.277 --> 18:02.477
And his dog.

18:02.478 --> 18:03.978
Who is he, exactly?

18:03.979 --> 18:05.413
They call him the Hatchet Man.

18:05.414 --> 18:06.748
And not for his wood-chopping skills.

18:06.749 --> 18:08.550
Rhodes Scholar, brilliant legal career.

18:08.551 --> 18:11.553
Which led to a promising political career

18:11.554 --> 18:13.121
derailed by a scandalous
divorce six years ago.

18:13.122 --> 18:14.989
He makes a profitable living now

18:14.990 --> 18:16.791
as a couch-sitter. He's the guy who moves

18:16.792 --> 18:18.559
into a cabinet member's office

18:18.560 --> 18:20.728
and dispenses cool, calculated advice.

18:20.729 --> 18:23.398
Unaffected by a need to
advance his own interests,

18:23.399 --> 18:24.799
since he has none.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.769
And by cool, calculated advice, you mean...

18:27.770 --> 18:29.803
Firing people.

18:34.342 --> 18:36.444
Okay.

18:36.445 --> 18:39.113
What's a Black Eye from Otis Beanery?

18:39.114 --> 18:40.982
It's a coffee with a
double shot of espresso

18:40.983 --> 18:44.252
from an overpriced boutique on K Street.

18:44.253 --> 18:46.053
Thank you.

18:46.054 --> 18:47.588
I'll be back.

18:47.589 --> 18:50.057
Don't let that dog near my desk.

18:50.058 --> 18:52.425
Either one of them.

18:53.894 --> 18:55.596
This is quite the pickle
you've gotten yourself into,

18:55.597 --> 18:57.932
Madam Secretary, and what's
going on with your staff?

18:57.933 --> 18:59.734
Are they all someone's nieces and nephews?

18:59.735 --> 19:00.968
Where did you find them?

19:00.969 --> 19:03.003
I inherited them.

19:03.004 --> 19:04.205
Tell me you're kidding.

19:04.206 --> 19:06.841
Uh, their boss had just died.

19:06.842 --> 19:08.943
I was new to this world.

19:08.944 --> 19:10.211
Look, they have proven themselves

19:10.212 --> 19:11.946
up to this point, and I...

19:11.947 --> 19:14.181
You're giving me that
“you're an idiot” look.

19:14.182 --> 19:15.482
Because you're an idiot.

19:15.483 --> 19:16.884
You kept someone else's staff

19:16.885 --> 19:18.986
because you didn't want them to be sad?

19:18.987 --> 19:20.854
I mean, these people

19:20.855 --> 19:22.122
are unmitigated chuckleheads.

19:22.123 --> 19:23.424
They should've seen this coming

19:23.425 --> 19:24.892
a mile away from the polling numbers.

19:24.893 --> 19:26.260
To be fair, they briefed me

19:26.261 --> 19:28.629
on the polling numbers before the hearing.

19:28.630 --> 19:30.297
They've been through the roof for months.

19:30.298 --> 19:32.900
Now everyone's gonna want to take you out

19:32.901 --> 19:34.835
at the knees before you can mount a serious

19:34.836 --> 19:36.803
presidential bid in the next
post-Dalton election cycle.

19:36.804 --> 19:38.505
- I have no such ambitions.
- Stick with that story.

19:38.506 --> 19:39.873
Modesty's a good color on you.

19:39.874 --> 19:40.908
It'll play really well in the primary.

19:40.909 --> 19:42.609
I don't. I don't.

19:42.610 --> 19:44.944
Okay, whatever.

19:45.846 --> 19:47.214
Dump your team.

19:47.215 --> 19:49.149
- Now.
- All at once?

19:49.150 --> 19:50.550
No, that-that looks desperate.

19:50.551 --> 19:51.818
One by one,

19:51.819 --> 19:53.720
but start somewhere near the top,

19:53.721 --> 19:55.188
and start today.

19:55.189 --> 19:57.524
All right, let's-let's...

19:57.525 --> 19:59.826
just put a pin in that idea for now.

19:59.827 --> 20:01.895
Bess, I know you have a bug up your parts

20:01.896 --> 20:03.096
about justice and fair play.

20:03.097 --> 20:04.898
And that might have been great

20:04.899 --> 20:06.533
sitting at a desk at the CIA

20:06.534 --> 20:08.435
or as a faculty of some quaint university.

20:08.436 --> 20:10.203
This is Washington.

20:10.204 --> 20:11.838
Kill or be killed.

20:11.839 --> 20:13.039
Adapt or die.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.474
It's that simple.

20:14.475 --> 20:16.009
Mike, I hear you.

20:16.010 --> 20:19.645
I do, and I'm not opposed
to firing my staff.

20:21.047 --> 20:23.482
But I have a bigger plan.

20:25.118 --> 20:27.787
I want to take this fight
straight at Everard Burke.

20:27.788 --> 20:30.023
Okay.

20:30.024 --> 20:32.258
- I'd like that, too.
- What do we do?

20:32.259 --> 20:34.494
You're in a knife fight
with Chairman Burke.

20:34.495 --> 20:36.529
The way to win a knife
fight is to bring a gun

20:36.530 --> 20:37.797
and waste the son of a bitch.

20:37.798 --> 20:39.833
Excellent.

20:39.834 --> 20:42.200
We're on the same page.

20:44.003 --> 20:46.711
She always texts me

20:46.712 --> 20:48.212
when she leaves,

20:48.213 --> 20:51.883
so I guess she's still
in there with Mike B.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.851
It was a pleasure working with y'all.

20:53.852 --> 20:55.686
- I'm sure I'm the fall guy.
- Oh, come on, no, you're not.

20:55.687 --> 20:57.822
No, no, it's me. She
already almost fired me.

20:57.823 --> 20:59.390
Are you kidding?

20:59.391 --> 21:01.993
The PR on this is a nightmare
with a hair stuck to it,

21:01.994 --> 21:03.527
and she almost fired me, too.

21:03.528 --> 21:04.829
She almost fired me first.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.630
Oh, no need to cherry pick.

21:06.631 --> 21:08.966
The smart thing to do is fire us all.

21:08.967 --> 21:11.235
She can't do that.

21:11.236 --> 21:12.937
Can she?

21:12.938 --> 21:14.805
I would.

21:14.806 --> 21:17.575
Well, so much for pacing myself.

21:17.576 --> 21:19.110
Waitress...

21:19.111 --> 21:20.578
Hey.

21:20.579 --> 21:21.912
You have perfect timing.

21:21.913 --> 21:23.480
I'll take everything you got there.

21:23.481 --> 21:25.649
Mm, you're in luck.

21:25.650 --> 21:29.386
These shots are for your table
from the gentleman over here.

21:29.387 --> 21:32.073
- Who is that?
- Kyle Feeney.

21:32.074 --> 21:33.190
He's a staffer for Chairman Burke.

21:33.191 --> 21:34.892
He's the guy who dug up the dirt

21:34.893 --> 21:36.360
on the Microloan program.

21:36.361 --> 21:38.328
That bottom-feeding little twerp.

21:38.329 --> 21:40.197
You-you can send those back.

21:40.198 --> 21:41.198
No, hey, hang on.

21:41.199 --> 21:43.867
He owes us. Just leave them there.

21:43.868 --> 21:46.205
That little twerp found
something we all missed.

21:46.206 --> 21:47.870
So what does that say about us?

21:52.509 --> 21:53.677
See you

21:53.678 --> 21:55.244
at the back of the line, kids.

21:59.750 --> 22:00.951
Wait.

22:00.952 --> 22:03.287
Yes! No... We, no,

22:03.288 --> 22:04.688
we received the online forms,

22:04.689 --> 22:07.991
but we need notarized hard copies.

22:07.992 --> 22:10.127
N-Notarized.

22:10.128 --> 22:11.895
Like, with a notary.

22:11.896 --> 22:13.830
No, no! Pas de cartes.

22:13.831 --> 22:17.234
Uh, notary. How do you,
how do you say notary?

22:17.235 --> 22:19.503
Uh... notaire.

22:19.504 --> 22:20.470
Un-Un notaire?

22:20.471 --> 22:22.506
Oui!

22:22.507 --> 22:24.741
I'm sorry. Please, slow down. I...

22:24.742 --> 22:27.310
Pa... uh, parler slowly?

22:27.311 --> 22:29.012
Lentement.

22:29.013 --> 22:30.347
Can... I'm sorry. Can you take this?

22:30.348 --> 22:32.349
Me? You speak French, right?

22:32.350 --> 22:33.717
- Yes, but...
- Yeah, I'm trying to negotiate

22:33.718 --> 22:34.985
a bank problem in Senegal

22:34.986 --> 22:36.152
with two years of high school French.

22:36.153 --> 22:37.187
It-it's hopeless.

22:37.188 --> 22:38.755
I don't actually work here.

22:38.756 --> 22:40.123
I just came by to see
maybe if I can volunteer?

22:40.124 --> 22:41.558
Nobody works here. They
all heard the program

22:41.559 --> 22:42.592
was getting cut, so they've

22:42.593 --> 22:43.827
gone off looking for other jobs.

22:43.828 --> 22:45.195
It's like rats off a sinking ship.

22:45.196 --> 22:47.564
Which means if you're here to volunteer?

22:47.565 --> 22:49.099
Y-You just got a battlefield promotion.

22:49.100 --> 22:51.935
Uh, just take this call.

22:51.936 --> 22:53.703
Bonjour.

22:53.704 --> 22:54.771
Microloans United?

22:54.772 --> 22:56.739
Puis-je aider?

22:56.740 --> 22:58.484
Hello? yeah, they're not
in the office right now.

22:58.485 --> 22:59.442
- Can I take a me...?
- Oui.

22:59.443 --> 23:00.476
Il a recu Les formes.

23:00.477 --> 23:01.611
- Okay.
- Mais il a besoin

23:01.612 --> 23:02.879
de copies papier.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.746
Un notaire?

23:05.915 --> 23:07.617
Merci. Moment.

23:07.618 --> 23:10.219
Um, he said that that's fine.

23:10.220 --> 23:13.289
He's going to do that tomorrow
and overnight the papers to you?

23:13.290 --> 23:15.458
Ah, great! Good-bye.

23:15.459 --> 23:19.060
Bon. Au revoir!

23:23.032 --> 23:24.967
Uh...

23:24.968 --> 23:26.903
pick out a desk.

23:28.272 --> 23:30.573
I wanted to bring you up

23:30.574 --> 23:33.609
to speed on the changes
we're making in this office.

23:33.610 --> 23:35.545
Mike is suggesting that I fire some...

23:35.546 --> 23:37.546
or all of you.

23:37.547 --> 23:39.515
And I'm considering his suggestions.

23:39.516 --> 23:42.718
For now, I'm putting you all on notice.

23:42.719 --> 23:43.819
That was a big mess.

23:43.820 --> 23:44.987
That was a sack full

23:44.988 --> 23:46.422
of mangled kittens in the hot sun

23:46.423 --> 23:48.524
two weeks old... that's what that was.

23:48.525 --> 23:50.459
Moving ahead, I'm looking

23:50.460 --> 23:53.362
for nothing short of perfection.

23:53.363 --> 23:55.297
That's the bar. Is that clear?

23:55.298 --> 23:57.099
Yes, ma'am.

23:57.100 --> 23:59.500
Great. That's all.

24:01.470 --> 24:03.838
Jay?

24:04.473 --> 24:06.674
Could you stay behind?

24:35.496 --> 24:37.809
You're here for me, right, Alex?

24:37.810 --> 24:39.011
Yeah, Jay. It's protocol.

24:39.012 --> 24:41.246
I-I get it.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.347
I'll have your tablet, sir. And your I.D.

25:00.265 --> 25:02.833
The secretary will see you now.

25:07.305 --> 25:09.941
I first wanted to congratulate you

25:09.942 --> 25:12.610
for ferreting out corruption
within our department.

25:12.611 --> 25:14.112
You did your country a great service.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.014
Thank you.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.616
The intention was not to
take a shot at you, per Se.

25:18.617 --> 25:21.086
Uh, there was a larger goal...

25:21.087 --> 25:22.354
involved.

25:22.355 --> 25:23.655
Kyle!

25:23.656 --> 25:25.323
I'm agreeing with you.

25:25.324 --> 25:27.459
- Okay.
- That's why I'm offering you

25:27.460 --> 25:29.259
a job.

25:31.763 --> 25:33.498
Okay, so what's the going rate

25:33.499 --> 25:36.801
for milk in Kampala?

25:36.802 --> 25:38.937
Okay, and...

25:38.938 --> 25:42.106
does he have access to refrigeration?

25:42.107 --> 25:44.142
Great. Okay.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.811
Well, um, if you could just
send us verification of that?

25:46.812 --> 25:50.113
And we can start to process
your application right away.

25:51.049 --> 25:52.483
Okay. Thank you.

25:52.484 --> 25:53.551
Bye.

25:53.552 --> 25:54.986
How late can you stay?

25:54.987 --> 25:57.255
I want to start exploiting
you as soon as possible.

25:57.256 --> 25:58.923
You mean I actually have this job?

25:58.924 --> 26:00.091
Don't get ahead of yourself.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.392
It's an internship.

26:01.393 --> 26:02.894
I've got the only job left around here.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.162
Okay, but

26:04.163 --> 26:05.997
you don't know anything about me.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.331
I know you speak French.

26:07.332 --> 26:08.699
And you got a pulse.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.767
That'll do.

27:52.035 --> 27:55.170
Well, I think it's safe to
say the op was compromised.

27:57.641 --> 28:01.177
Who could've blown this?

28:01.178 --> 28:03.847
Who even knew this operation was underway?

28:03.848 --> 28:05.181
No one outside this room.

28:05.182 --> 28:06.616
And who else?

28:06.617 --> 28:09.886
I never believed you got as far as you did

28:09.887 --> 28:11.454
with this idea on your own.

28:11.455 --> 28:14.023
Who else?

28:14.024 --> 28:17.093
Look at it from where I'm standing.

28:17.094 --> 28:20.673
The only way this op could've been blown

28:20.674 --> 28:22.198
was if somebody knew about it.

28:22.199 --> 28:23.933
If there was a mole.

28:23.934 --> 28:26.970
And since nobody outside our
inner sanctum knew about it,

28:26.971 --> 28:28.571
I have to look at you.

28:28.572 --> 28:30.640
I have been completely loyal
to you from the beginning.

28:30.641 --> 28:31.741
Did you tell

28:31.742 --> 28:34.744
anybody about our plans? I...

28:34.745 --> 28:36.646
- Juliet?
- Are you crazy?

28:36.647 --> 28:38.681
Juliet made it clear she
wanted nothing to do with this.

28:38.682 --> 28:40.183
Once I signed up, I knew you were

28:40.184 --> 28:43.284
the only person I could trust.

28:44.153 --> 28:46.789
I-I got to ask you again, Bess.

28:46.790 --> 28:49.257
Can we really trust Munsey?

28:50.526 --> 28:52.862
He put too much on the
line for this operation.

28:52.863 --> 28:54.564
If it gets out how badly it failed,

28:54.565 --> 28:56.132
he's not gonna have that job much longer.

28:56.133 --> 28:57.433
And why would he do it?

28:57.434 --> 29:00.036
Why not just stonewall us?

29:00.037 --> 29:03.471
We have to consider everything.

29:05.174 --> 29:07.709
Then there's Occam's razor.

29:09.278 --> 29:11.580
The simplest explanation

29:11.581 --> 29:13.781
is the best.

29:20.256 --> 29:23.826
I can't say I blame you.

29:23.827 --> 29:27.428
But I can't say I'll forgive you, either.

29:42.845 --> 29:45.084
You're still here.

29:45.085 --> 29:47.152
Yes. Why wouldn't I be?

29:47.153 --> 29:50.289
Oh, my God! You think
this is a paid internship.

29:50.290 --> 29:51.490
No, I don't.

29:51.491 --> 29:53.192
Because it so isn't.

29:53.193 --> 29:55.627
Yeah, I-I, I figured...

29:55.628 --> 29:57.329
Okay, good.

29:57.330 --> 30:00.599
On the upside, that means
your mother's budget cuts

30:00.600 --> 30:02.101
won't affect the position.

30:02.102 --> 30:04.470
You know who my mother is?

30:04.471 --> 30:06.038
I do.

30:06.039 --> 30:07.906
And I don't care.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.975
Unlike literally everybody else I've hired,

30:09.976 --> 30:11.510
you want to be here.

30:11.511 --> 30:13.679
That works in your favor.

30:13.680 --> 30:15.180
Great.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.783
Here's some paperwork

30:17.784 --> 30:20.185
you'll need to take to your
school's career services office.

30:20.186 --> 30:23.855
Oh, um, I'm actually not in school, so...

30:23.856 --> 30:25.457
Oh, the, uh,

30:25.458 --> 30:28.427
internship's only available
for college credit.

30:28.428 --> 30:29.795
Uh, like you said.

30:29.796 --> 30:31.329
I'm really happy to be here.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.864
I mean, I really like feeling useful...

30:32.865 --> 30:34.433
No, we have to do it

30:34.434 --> 30:36.801
in conjunction with a
university course. It's, uh...

30:36.802 --> 30:38.937
Otherwise asking people to
work for no compensation is

30:38.938 --> 30:40.338
what the government likes to call slavery.

30:40.339 --> 30:41.706
Well...

30:41.707 --> 30:44.209
can I, can I sign a waiver or something?

30:44.210 --> 30:45.610
No, it's nonnegotiable.

30:45.611 --> 30:47.913
It's part of the program's charter.

30:47.914 --> 30:50.280
I'm sorry.

30:57.222 --> 30:59.257
Barry, come on.

30:59.258 --> 31:00.892
Fill her up.

31:00.893 --> 31:02.861
Jay, man, I think that's a bad idea.

31:02.862 --> 31:04.496
- Aw, come on... What?
- And you've been here all day.

31:04.497 --> 31:05.697
Go home to your wife.

31:05.698 --> 31:07.432
On, believe me, that's...

31:07.433 --> 31:09.801
a bad idea. Come on.

31:09.802 --> 31:11.102
Come on, I'm not driving.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.670
- Give me a break, give me a break.
- Hey!

31:12.671 --> 31:14.539
- Just fill them up, please.
- Okay.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.473
But this one closes you out.

31:20.078 --> 31:22.380
I'll get this one, Barry.

31:22.381 --> 31:25.148
No, no.

31:26.150 --> 31:27.618
I don't want your hospitality.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.387
Hey, what are you mad at me for?

31:29.388 --> 31:31.389
I could've had your job.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.624
I turned it down.

31:33.625 --> 31:37.228
Yeah, well, that doesn't
give it back to me.

31:37.229 --> 31:39.564
Well, you should've made her
cut the Microloans program.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.899
Dude, I begged her.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.936
Burke was just looking for a
reason to humiliate your boss.

31:44.937 --> 31:46.170
She handed it to him.

31:46.171 --> 31:49.272
Former boss And, yes, she did.

31:51.209 --> 31:53.711
But it was only a matter of
time though anyway, right?

31:53.712 --> 31:55.212
I mean, she's out of her depth.

31:55.213 --> 31:58.582
You have no idea.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.285
I told her to fire me
after the document leak.

32:01.286 --> 32:03.086
But... no.

32:04.722 --> 32:07.291
Coming in with the cuddly Vietnamese...

32:07.292 --> 32:08.993
witness...

32:08.994 --> 32:10.494
It was amateur hour.

32:10.495 --> 32:12.062
Yeah, like Burke was ever
gonna let that happen.

32:12.063 --> 32:13.364
He should have let that happen!

32:13.365 --> 32:17.301
She sucked! No English.

32:17.302 --> 32:19.170
Yeah?

32:19.171 --> 32:20.738
No clue what we were doing there.

32:20.739 --> 32:21.906
A shining example

32:21.907 --> 32:23.407
of why we should cut the program.

32:23.408 --> 32:24.975
Do you know how many times I said

32:24.976 --> 32:26.577
- cut the program?!
- Hey, hey, man!

32:26.578 --> 32:29.046
Sorry... man. Sorry, Barry.

32:29.047 --> 32:31.782
Hey, just let it go.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.251
You know, just be happy
you're out of there.

32:34.252 --> 32:37.026
You could work this to your advantage.

32:37.027 --> 32:39.823
I could put in a word with
Burke in terms of staffing.

32:39.824 --> 32:42.793
A guy with your experience
could be a real asset to us.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.695
Oh... man.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.296
You know what? I should be...

32:46.297 --> 32:49.099
I should reign it in.

32:49.100 --> 32:51.869
Don't beat yourself up.

32:53.872 --> 32:57.808
That would leave me a lot of spare time.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.276
See you next time, Barry.

32:59.277 --> 33:01.744
Get home safe, Jay.

33:06.483 --> 33:10.320
Uh, excuse me, Madam Secretary?

33:10.321 --> 33:11.755
Matt and Daisy would like a moment.

33:11.756 --> 33:12.956
Sure.

33:12.957 --> 33:15.125
I think they were hoping

33:15.126 --> 33:16.460
for a moment alone.

33:16.461 --> 33:18.128
Hope in one hand, spit in the other.

33:18.129 --> 33:19.963
- Send 'em in. I mean, your call.
- Send them in.

33:19.964 --> 33:21.697
Yeah. Guys...

33:22.722 --> 33:24.557
Ma'am, we feel the need to speak up

33:24.558 --> 33:26.225
about Jay being fired from the staff.

33:26.226 --> 33:28.327
O-Okay.

33:28.328 --> 33:29.996
- What?
- In point of fact,

33:29.997 --> 33:32.632
Jay was the one arguing
for cutting the program.

33:32.633 --> 33:34.066
We were the ones arguing to keep it.

33:34.067 --> 33:35.247
So if you're going to fire Jay,

33:35.248 --> 33:37.570
- you might as well fire all of us.
- Interesting.

33:37.571 --> 33:38.938
The Spartacus offensive.

33:38.939 --> 33:40.506
You guys realize how
that story ends, right?

33:40.507 --> 33:42.141
You don't know the first
thing about us, Mr. Barnow.

33:42.142 --> 33:43.643
I know everything about you, Maisy.

33:43.644 --> 33:45.978
- Daisy.
- He's combining our names.

33:45.979 --> 33:47.680
Reducing us to a single,
insignificant unit.

33:47.681 --> 33:49.315
I smell daylight burning.

33:49.316 --> 33:50.783
Okay, is your dog named
after G. Gordon Liddy?

33:50.784 --> 33:51.884
Because that explains a lot.

33:51.885 --> 33:53.819
Excuse me, ma'am,

33:53.820 --> 33:56.215
- Ms. Tolliver is also here.
- Ah, it's a solidarity scrum.

33:56.216 --> 33:57.690
Madam Secretary, we've just

33:57.691 --> 33:59.091
received word that Burke's

33:59.092 --> 34:00.426
Congressional hearing is reconvening.

34:00.427 --> 34:01.660
You've been asked to appear.

34:01.661 --> 34:03.490
- When?
- In an hour.

34:03.491 --> 34:05.058
They're calling your witness,

34:05.059 --> 34:06.525
Nhung Chuang.

34:07.640 --> 34:09.034
The committee will come to order.

34:09.036 --> 34:11.623
Ms. Chuang, through your translator...

34:11.623 --> 34:14.225
...please give us your
first-person account

34:14.226 --> 34:16.860
of your dealings with the
State Department-funded program,

34:16.862 --> 34:19.697
Microloans United.

34:19.697 --> 34:22.458
...Microloans United.

34:22.833 --> 34:25.335
Thank you, Mr. Chairman,

34:25.337 --> 34:27.570
members of Congress.

34:28.772 --> 34:31.841
I am happy to address
the committee in English.

34:32.609 --> 34:35.978
I am from a small mountain village

34:35.980 --> 34:39.083
in Northwest Vietnam.

34:39.083 --> 34:43.187
I worked as a field laborer
from the time I could walk.

34:43.188 --> 34:46.356
When my husband died in a flood,

34:46.357 --> 34:50.159
I was unable to feed my two children.

34:50.161 --> 34:53.664
I moved in with my sister
in a neighboring village.

34:53.665 --> 34:55.532
That is where I heard

34:55.533 --> 34:57.200
about the Microloan Program.

34:57.201 --> 34:59.936
Together, my sister and I

34:59.937 --> 35:02.239
received a $200 loan

35:02.240 --> 35:03.740
to grow vegetables.

35:03.741 --> 35:05.375
And English lessons.

35:05.376 --> 35:07.042
Obviously.

35:08.245 --> 35:11.581
They gave us mobile
phones to manage our money

35:11.582 --> 35:15.952
and taught us how to look up the price

35:15.953 --> 35:19.022
of our vegetables in the market.

35:19.023 --> 35:21.925
We were able to organize
the women in our co-op

35:21.926 --> 35:24.726
and... form a co-op.

35:27.097 --> 35:28.498
Now we have enough money

35:28.499 --> 35:31.001
to build roads and flood channels.

35:31.002 --> 35:34.637
But what I am most proud of

35:34.638 --> 35:37.907
is the new school where
my children are learning.

35:37.908 --> 35:42.378
It is my son, Mr. Chairman,

35:42.379 --> 35:44.314
who taught me English.

35:44.315 --> 35:46.449
Mr. Chairman,

35:46.450 --> 35:48.785
my office has taken swift measures

35:48.786 --> 35:51.788
to address the corruption
inside the Microloans Program,

35:51.789 --> 35:55.427
a situation that was allowed

35:55.428 --> 35:58.261
to develop because of budget cuts

35:58.262 --> 36:00.363
that all but eliminated
the oversight committee.

36:00.364 --> 36:02.398
But as you can see,

36:02.399 --> 36:05.168
there is plenty here worth fighting for.

36:05.169 --> 36:08.971
And I am extremely
proud to lead that fight.

36:08.972 --> 36:11.373
Thank you.

36:14.677 --> 36:17.613
Is your mother's maiden name Weller?

36:17.614 --> 36:19.015
Yes.

36:19.016 --> 36:21.384
Did you attend Yale University?

36:21.385 --> 36:23.819
Yes.

36:23.820 --> 36:27.957
Are you employed by the
Central Intelligence Agency?

36:27.958 --> 36:29.659
Yes.

36:29.660 --> 36:32.561
Do you have access to
classified information

36:32.562 --> 36:34.363
regarding national security?

36:34.364 --> 36:35.698
Yes.

36:35.699 --> 36:37.600
Have you shared

36:37.601 --> 36:39.869
classified information

36:39.870 --> 36:41.470
with anyone outside the Agency?

36:41.471 --> 36:43.873
No.

36:43.874 --> 36:45.241
Does anyone have access

36:45.242 --> 36:47.109
to your secure files?

36:47.110 --> 36:48.677
No.

36:48.678 --> 36:50.813
Have you accepted money

36:50.814 --> 36:52.715
in exchange for classified information?

36:52.716 --> 36:54.583
No.

36:54.584 --> 36:56.285
Do you know anyone who has accepted money

36:56.286 --> 36:58.906
in exchange for classified information?

36:58.907 --> 37:00.254
No.

37:01.590 --> 37:03.592
She passed the polygraph test

37:03.593 --> 37:06.895
and somebody planted a
very sophisticated device

37:06.896 --> 37:08.130
in her bag.

37:08.131 --> 37:09.398
Can we officially disqualify her

37:09.399 --> 37:11.834
- as being the mole?
- Of course not.

37:11.835 --> 37:13.435
I appreciate your loyalty to your friend,

37:13.436 --> 37:15.838
but that's the oldest
CIA trick in the book...

37:15.839 --> 37:18.073
planting a bug on yourself
to divert attention.

37:18.074 --> 37:20.042
- Am I right?
- It's been done.

37:20.043 --> 37:21.310
What about the polygraph?

37:21.311 --> 37:22.544
You're trained to beat those.

37:22.545 --> 37:24.580
Oh, come on, that's ridiculous.

37:24.581 --> 37:27.950
Only the most specialized
field op can do that

37:27.951 --> 37:30.319
and even they can't do it
with any degree of regularity.

37:30.320 --> 37:31.920
I'm not saying it has to be her.

37:31.921 --> 37:34.256
I'm saying we can't take her off the list.

37:34.257 --> 37:36.391
The list being anybody
in the entire Agency.

37:36.392 --> 37:37.559
Including people at the top?

37:37.560 --> 37:38.960
Because, you know, “trust no one.”

37:38.961 --> 37:40.562
Excuse me, Madam Secretary,

37:40.563 --> 37:44.031
- what are you implying?
- Let's not unravel.

37:44.032 --> 37:45.834
We have more immediate problems.

37:45.835 --> 37:48.170
Turkish officials are very curious

37:48.171 --> 37:50.806
about the tourist status
of the dead American.

37:50.807 --> 37:52.707
It's only a matter of time
before they put together

37:52.708 --> 37:54.609
- that he was CIA.
- How much time?

37:54.610 --> 37:56.411
Given that I'm already dodging phone calls

37:56.412 --> 37:59.347
from the their Defense
Minister's office, not much.

37:59.348 --> 38:01.449
We don't have any moves left.

38:01.450 --> 38:02.984
It's time to bring

38:02.985 --> 38:04.618
the president in on this.

38:07.355 --> 38:09.890
I'll think about it.

38:25.351 --> 38:27.985
Well...

38:30.055 --> 38:31.991
Look who I found lurking around,

38:31.992 --> 38:33.592
claiming he still works here.

38:33.593 --> 38:35.127
Oh-oh!

38:35.128 --> 38:37.463
- Hey!
- Yeah!

38:37.464 --> 38:39.465
James Bond. Look at this guy.

38:39.466 --> 38:40.732
Sorry about the tradecraft,

38:40.733 --> 38:42.868
everybody, but it was the quickest way

38:42.869 --> 38:44.203
to get this done.

38:44.204 --> 38:45.604
And to send the message to Burke

38:45.605 --> 38:47.172
that you won't be taken down so easily.

38:47.173 --> 38:48.707
You really lapped it up, Jay,

38:48.708 --> 38:50.142
I gotta say.

38:50.143 --> 38:51.743
I mean, Langley could use a guy like you,

38:51.744 --> 38:53.912
if you ever tire of policy advising.

38:53.913 --> 38:55.981
I don't think most marks
would be as easy as Kyle.

38:55.982 --> 38:57.862
Oh, you'd be surprised.

38:57.863 --> 38:59.518
So...

38:59.519 --> 39:01.319
sorry I couldn't let anyone in on the ruse.

39:01.320 --> 39:03.688
So bringing in Mike B. was a part of it?

39:03.689 --> 39:05.358
Because I gotta tell you, I hate that guy.

39:05.359 --> 39:06.625
Well, from a PR standpoint,

39:06.626 --> 39:07.659
it was the right move.

39:11.263 --> 39:13.665
Gordon! Get over here!

39:13.666 --> 39:15.022
Sorry about that. He's a little

39:15.023 --> 39:16.935
giddy with success. I'll
be in your office, M Sec?

39:16.936 --> 39:18.036
Sure.

39:18.037 --> 39:19.037
Yeah. Come on, let's go.

39:23.608 --> 39:26.011
Mike B.'s just going to hang
around for a little while.

39:26.012 --> 39:28.378
Let's get started.

39:29.814 --> 39:32.250
Actually, I think I am. Put this away...

39:32.251 --> 39:33.518
I can't believe it.

39:33.519 --> 39:34.819
He's going for risotto.

39:34.820 --> 39:36.154
They always lose with that one.

39:36.155 --> 39:37.856
- It's the Waterloo of food.
- Right?

39:37.857 --> 39:39.791
I know. What is the deal?
You can't cook it fast.

39:39.792 --> 39:41.220
- They ought to know it.
- And gnocchi. Gnocchi.

39:41.221 --> 39:42.460
- They never learn.
- They always lose

39:42.461 --> 39:43.962
- with gnocchi, too.
- Well, because you think

39:43.963 --> 39:45.830
it's going to be good but it's not.

39:45.831 --> 39:47.966
In the end, it really is
just doughy potato balls.

39:47.967 --> 39:49.534
- That's what I'm saying.
- That's it.

39:49.535 --> 39:50.869
Hey, you guys. Sorry to interrupt.

39:50.870 --> 39:53.171
- Hey.
- Hey. No, we're just hanging.

39:53.172 --> 39:53.863
What's up?

39:53.864 --> 39:55.840
Yeah, we're just talking about
something really important.

39:55.841 --> 39:58.009
- Yeah, I heard. Uh, potato balls.
- Yeah.

39:58.010 --> 40:00.210
Sit down. What's going on?

40:01.713 --> 40:03.648
I need to borrow some money.

40:03.649 --> 40:06.050
Okay. Well... how much?

40:06.051 --> 40:09.153
About $20,000.

40:09.154 --> 40:11.389
For now.

40:11.390 --> 40:13.758
Wow. Okay.

40:13.759 --> 40:15.893
That's... so much.

40:15.894 --> 40:19.163
I'm applying to Georgetown next semester.

40:19.164 --> 40:20.665
It's actually probably a lot less

40:20.666 --> 40:22.166
with the faculty discount, so...

40:22.167 --> 40:24.702
- Yeah.
- Sub... substantially less.

40:24.703 --> 40:26.237
You're gonna go to Georgetown?

40:26.238 --> 40:27.471
If I'm accepted.

40:27.472 --> 40:28.739
Um, I got an internship

40:28.740 --> 40:30.208
at the Microloans Program,

40:30.209 --> 40:31.709
and I can only do it

40:31.710 --> 40:34.545
if I apply it toward
a college course. So...

40:34.546 --> 40:37.081
- I figured, you know, why not?
- Oh. Oh...

40:37.082 --> 40:39.950
- Cool.
- Yeah, well, whatever we can do to help.

40:39.951 --> 40:41.419
Okay, so...

40:41.420 --> 40:44.121
it's okay with you guys

40:44.122 --> 40:46.624
if... if I go ahead and apply?

40:46.625 --> 40:48.692
- Yeah.
- Whatever. Sure.

40:48.693 --> 40:50.594
No problem.

40:50.595 --> 40:51.829
Okay.

40:51.830 --> 40:53.496
Great.

41:02.539 --> 41:06.110
Just so we're clear...

41:06.111 --> 41:08.979
um, I'm doing this for me.

41:08.980 --> 41:10.547
Not you.

41:10.548 --> 41:12.483
- Absolutely.
- No question.

41:12.484 --> 41:13.684
Great, okay.

41:13.685 --> 41:15.346
- Good night.
- Good night.

41:15.347 --> 41:16.353
Night.

41:16.354 --> 41:18.689
Sleep well.

41:18.690 --> 41:20.323
We're on your side!

41:21.325 --> 41:22.559
That was lame,

41:22.560 --> 41:23.827
that last part. “We're on your side”?

41:23.828 --> 41:25.229
- I know better than that.
- Yeah, just...

41:25.230 --> 41:26.430
- That's not even...
- Yeah, don't...

41:26.431 --> 41:27.764
Take, just... take the win.

41:27.765 --> 41:28.999
Okay?

41:29.000 --> 41:30.434
Ah!

41:30.435 --> 41:32.352
- Nice whispering, Damocles.
- How 'bout that?

41:32.353 --> 41:33.203
- Ah...
- That's darn right.

41:33.204 --> 41:34.404
Wait, hold on.

41:34.405 --> 41:35.772
- No, hold on.
- Really?

41:35.773 --> 41:38.675
Hey.

41:38.676 --> 41:41.945
Don't tell me what you're gonna say.

41:41.946 --> 41:44.513
- I-I gotta to go.
- Bye.

41:45.515 --> 41:48.585
We believe there is a mole

41:48.586 --> 41:50.086
in our own security establishment.

41:50.087 --> 41:53.022
That's why it's risen to your level.

41:54.324 --> 41:56.660
Why am I just learning about this?

41:56.661 --> 42:00.163
We wanted to preserve
plausible deniability for you.

42:00.164 --> 42:01.531
You shouldn't have waited so long.

42:01.532 --> 42:03.400
It was a judgment call, Mr. President.

42:03.401 --> 42:07.403
A bad one, as it turns out.

42:07.404 --> 42:09.406
I've got news for you all.

42:09.407 --> 42:13.242
I had questions about the
Dubai crash at the time.

42:14.644 --> 42:16.413
I assigned a pair to investigate.

42:16.414 --> 42:20.216
They reported to me that
it was an accident...

42:20.217 --> 42:21.885
which implies

42:21.886 --> 42:23.353
that they were hiding the truth.

42:23.354 --> 42:25.422
One of those agents

42:25.423 --> 42:27.490
is dead now.

42:27.491 --> 42:30.058
George Peters.

42:36.232 --> 42:38.633
Who's the other agent?

42:47.543 --> 42:48.778
Stairs.

42:48.779 --> 42:50.011
Hallway.

42:51.080 --> 42:54.182
Down.

43:02.725 --> 43:05.485
Clear!

43:11.767 --> 43:13.569
Closets are emptied.

43:13.570 --> 43:16.680
Computer's wiped. She's cleared out.
