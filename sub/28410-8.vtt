10:09.608 --> 10:10.901
{\an7}No. No,

Number 71.

10:28.627 --> 10:29.712
{\an8}Yeah.

10:29.795 --> 10:30.880
{\an8}Do we need a lawyer?

10:30.963 --> 10:32.715
{\an8}I don't know.
I, uh, I left a message

10:32.798 --> 10:34.508
{\an8}with my business attorney,
just in case.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.719
{\an8}My credit cards
were declined.

10:39.764 --> 10:40.556
{\an8}Oh.

10:40.639 --> 10:42.016
{\an8}Oh, well, that...

10:42.099 --> 10:43.559
{\an9}(chuckles)
that must be it.

10:43.642 --> 10:45.269
{\an8}It has to be identity theft.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.937
{\an9}Someone hacked
your credit cards,

10:47.021 --> 10:48.189
{\an8}and now these...

10:48.272 --> 10:50.191
{\an8}people think
that you're a, uh...

10:50.274 --> 10:51.609
{\an8}a terrorist.

10:51.692 --> 10:54.403
{\an7}William...

10:54.487 --> 10:56.697
{\an8}I told Anna
she could use our address

10:56.781 --> 10:59.241
{\an8}so she could get her grandson
into Matheson Charter School.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.785
{\an8}Could that be the reason

11:00.868 --> 11:02.161
{\an8}why we're here?

11:02.244 --> 11:03.954
{\an8}Maybe Anna's kids
are into something

11:04.038 --> 11:05.539
{\an8}we don't know about.

11:04.038 --> 11:05.539
{\an8}Well, I-I...

11:05.623 --> 11:09.168
{\an8}I have to think this is just
a bizarre misunderstanding.

11:09.251 --> 11:11.253
{\an8}At some point,
we're gonna talk to someone

11:11.337 --> 11:14.548
{\an9}who will tell us the deal,
and we can explain ourselves,

11:14.632 --> 11:16.592
{\an9}and, um... we're
gonna go home.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.219
{\an8}Okay? And then

11:18.302 --> 11:21.514
{\an8}it'll just be a great story
for Gretchen and Stacey.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.183

Mr. Martin, finance manager,

12:19.530 --> 12:21.824

are a stay-at-home mom.

12:21.907 --> 12:25.161
{\an1}Can you tell us
why we're being detained?

12:25.244 --> 12:27.663
Yes. Uh, you've
been married six years,

12:27.746 --> 12:31.333
and your daughters are
eight years old?

12:32.293 --> 12:34.003
Do we need an attorney?

12:34.086 --> 12:37.965
This isn't really a...
an attorney thing.

12:38.048 --> 12:39.842
This is America.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.178
(chuckles): Everything
is an attorney thing.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.179
(chuckles softly)

{\an1}(chuckles)

12:44.930 --> 12:47.349
Okay, I'm just...
I'm just curious.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.894
Does this have anything
to do with...

12:49.977 --> 12:52.688
(whispers):
Matheson Charter School?

12:54.064 --> 12:55.566
You tell me.

12:55.649 --> 12:56.525
No.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.737
{\an6}No, no, no. You
brought her in here.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.737
{\an1}Okay.

12:59.820 --> 13:00.905
I told our housekeeper,
Anna Fuentes,

13:00.988 --> 13:01.864
she could use our address

13:01.947 --> 13:03.365
{\an3}so her grandson could go
to Matheson Charter.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.117
I did it. So...

13:05.201 --> 13:08.037
whatever we need to do
to make things right,

13:08.120 --> 13:09.830
we'll do it.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.333
A donation to Matheson

13:12.416 --> 13:14.376
{\an1}or...

13:14.460 --> 13:15.544
wherever...

13:15.628 --> 13:17.004
we'll do that.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.008
Are you suggesting
a financial inducement

13:21.091 --> 13:23.052
to your release?

13:26.931 --> 13:28.307
Uh...

13:30.809 --> 13:32.269
That is a shame, because...

13:32.353 --> 13:34.647
(chuckles)
this has nothing to do

13:34.730 --> 13:35.898

Fuentes at all.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.566

to do with?

13:37.650 --> 13:39.527

13:41.612 --> 13:43.906

13:41.612 --> 13:43.906

13:57.127 --> 13:59.421
That is the problem

13:59.505 --> 14:02.925
Inefficiency.
The inefficiency is astounding.

14:03.008 --> 14:06.679
There really was no reason to
drag all of you down here today.

14:06.762 --> 14:08.889

I'm just saying, forget it.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.100
{\an5}No harm, no foul.

25:29.319 --> 25:32.113
{\an1}So, Eve,
let's dig a little deeper.

25:32.197 --> 25:35.909
{\an1}Five years ago, this dimension
in which you and I exist

25:35.992 --> 25:40.455
was infiltrated by one
of our neighboring dimensions.

25:40.538 --> 25:42.082
{\an5}(alarm blares)

25:40.538 --> 25:42.082
During that initial exchange,

25:42.165 --> 25:44.000
we learned
that this was not, indeed,

25:44.084 --> 25:45.710
the first time
contact had been made

25:45.794 --> 25:47.295
between these two dimensions.

25:47.379 --> 25:50.632
{\an1}That 30 years ago,
a caravan from that dimension

25:50.715 --> 25:53.718
had crossed over into ours.

25:57.722 --> 26:01.643
These pilgrims risked everything

26:01.726 --> 26:06.189
{\an3}in the hopes of finding
a better dimension.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.525
A better future.

26:08.608 --> 26:10.652
A dimension where

26:10.735 --> 26:14.489
the sky was blue.

26:19.619 --> 26:22.289
Now...

26:22.372 --> 26:23.832
{\an1}we learned
that this other dimension

26:23.915 --> 26:27.043
was a lesser dimension.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.878
That these pilgrims

26:28.962 --> 26:32.048
{\an1}were diluting
the natural evolution

26:32.132 --> 26:34.301
of our lives as we know it.

26:36.219 --> 26:37.804
{\an1}And what if I told you
that the apparatus

26:37.887 --> 26:39.556
{\an1}you find yourself in
can be used

26:39.639 --> 26:42.892
{\an1}to record a pilgrim's
biometric response to a range

26:42.976 --> 26:45.687
{\an1}of stimuli
from that neighboring dimension?

26:45.770 --> 26:50.066
{\an1}That it is
the only truly accurate way

26:50.150 --> 26:52.027
{\an1}to determining
a suspected pilgrim's

26:52.110 --> 26:54.195
true point of origin?

26:54.279 --> 26:56.448
What would you say?

26:59.159 --> 27:03.163
I would say you don't
really care what my answer is.

27:06.958 --> 27:10.670
This will just be like playing
video games with your children.
