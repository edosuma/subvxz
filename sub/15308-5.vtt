[bell ringing]

00:10.076 --> 00:12.037
No way! A shark would tear it to shreds.

00:12.120 --> 00:13.455
It's got, like, 50 rows of teeth.

00:13.539 --> 00:15.791
Which the giant squid would clamp shut

00:15.874 --> 00:18.001
- with its huge tentacles, like this.
- [Zig] Hey!

00:18.084 --> 00:19.252
Uh, should I be jealous?

00:20.462 --> 00:22.506
Um... [clears throat]

00:22.589 --> 00:24.132
You guys know Lola?

00:24.716 --> 00:27.469
[tauntingly] Is she your girlfriend?

00:27.553 --> 00:29.596
Oh, we're... talking?

00:31.765 --> 00:34.309
- Nice hair, by the way.
- Oh, thank you. I like your...

00:34.976 --> 00:36.812
Um, your... your keychain.

00:36.895 --> 00:39.523
- I know, right? And it buzzes.
- [buzzing]

00:39.606 --> 00:41.733
[chuckling] Yes, well, I
assume that's why you bought it.

00:41.817 --> 00:43.819
Well, it's great for stress relief.

00:43.902 --> 00:46.530
- [laughs]
- Well, I'm sure it is.

00:46.613 --> 00:49.658
I don't think talking is
going to satisfy her, Tiny.

00:49.741 --> 00:52.327
All right, uh, we have to head to physics.

00:53.244 --> 00:55.246
[Zig and Maya chuckling]

00:56.289 --> 00:58.750
Oh, my God. Is there a pop quiz?

00:58.834 --> 01:00.836
Yes. What's wrong with my keychain?

01:01.462 --> 01:03.672
- Lo, that's a vibrator.
- Oh, ew!

01:03.755 --> 01:06.467
Oh, no, no. Do you think
Tiny thinks I use it?

01:06.550 --> 01:09.219
- Probably.
- [Shay] Just tell him you don't.

01:09.302 --> 01:10.804
We just started talking.

01:10.887 --> 01:13.264
How am I supposed to
talk to him about... that?

01:16.351 --> 01:17.352

Oh, damn. Oh, you idiots. Come on.

02:00.186 --> 02:03.690
Hey, uh, could you just keep
it down? I'm trying to focus.

02:03.774 --> 02:05.400
Yeah, me too. If Northern Tech wins this,

02:05.484 --> 02:06.818
then my gaming team makes playoffs.

02:06.902 --> 02:09.613
'Kay, can you watch it somewhere else?

02:09.696 --> 02:11.948
[scoffs] Since when are
you such a homework nut?

02:23.168 --> 02:24.252
Is this creative writing?

02:24.335 --> 02:27.213
Uh, there's some high school writing
feature in the <i>Toronto Interpreter.</i>

02:27.297 --> 02:30.466
Mr. Mitchell thinks that
they might publish it.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.803
Really? My son, the author?

02:32.886 --> 02:34.220
Well, it's not for sure yet.

02:34.304 --> 02:37.473
I still need to finish these
edits and send it to him tonight.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.768
So if you guys could just
give me some space, please?

02:39.851 --> 02:41.186
[Hunter] Yes!

02:41.269 --> 02:42.604
Parkdale lost!

02:43.521 --> 02:44.731
Which means we made playoffs!

02:45.899 --> 02:48.068
You'll understand when my
gaming team's playing in the gym,

02:48.151 --> 02:49.611
annihilating the competition.

02:49.695 --> 02:52.197
Ooh! Should we all go watch?

02:52.823 --> 02:54.407
[Hunter] You really wanna come?

02:55.867 --> 02:57.828
Yeah. Yeah, you're my brother.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.204
What if I want Dad to come, too?

03:00.038 --> 03:01.247
- Totally fine.
- Really?

03:02.248 --> 03:04.042
You guys are in for a show.

03:04.876 --> 03:08.004
[Mrs. Hollingsworth] I love it
that my boys are doing so well.

03:08.088 --> 03:09.590
Wait...

03:09.673 --> 03:11.216
how are you a favorite and I'm not?

03:11.299 --> 03:13.509
I guess I've just got it all figured out.

03:13.594 --> 03:14.970
Now, can I finish my work?

03:19.182 --> 03:20.976
[Maya] <i>No, you can't
read the lyrics yet!</i>

03:21.059 --> 03:22.811
They're just dumb placeholder words.

- [sighs]

03:26.481 --> 03:27.608
[Maya snickers]

03:29.234 --> 03:30.777
Um, we have the room.

03:30.861 --> 03:33.238
Oh, I know. Uh, that's
actually why we're here.

03:33.321 --> 03:34.865
We heard your song "Not Okay."

03:34.948 --> 03:36.995
Oh, how? Were you at our show?

03:37.618 --> 03:39.452
- I kinda posted it.
- "Kinda"?

03:39.535 --> 03:41.412
[stammers] No, I did for sure.

03:41.496 --> 03:44.332
Regardless, um, we'd be honored
if you'd play a show for us.

03:44.415 --> 03:45.584
For The Feminist Club?

03:45.667 --> 03:47.127
[Goldi] We hope to convince
the principal to convert

03:47.210 --> 03:48.879
one boys' washroom into a girls' washroom,

03:48.962 --> 03:51.381
and "Not Okay" would be the
perfect anthem to our protest.

03:51.464 --> 03:53.341
Oh, well, I mean, it's
not really an anthem.

03:53.424 --> 03:55.468
It's just kind of some
stuff I went through.

03:56.928 --> 03:57.971
Please think about it.

03:58.054 --> 03:59.389
[softly] Thanks.

04:00.348 --> 04:03.059
- [sighs]
- See? A show. Can't be mad now.

04:03.143 --> 04:06.021
- Yeah, but I mean, for The Feminist Club?
- What's wrong with feminists?

04:06.104 --> 04:08.564
That they get angry
over every little thing.

04:08.649 --> 04:11.192
[scoffs] Still, a gig's a gig.

04:11.276 --> 04:13.612
[both chuckle]

04:13.695 --> 04:15.906
- [bell ringing]
- Is that him?

04:16.865 --> 04:20.410
[chuckles] Nice wig, but
you can't avoid him forever.

04:20.493 --> 04:22.412
Hey, if she wants to avoid him...

04:22.495 --> 04:23.914
Look, you like him, right?

04:23.997 --> 04:27.542
Yeah, but now he thinks I'm
some loser who has to do...

04:27.626 --> 04:29.585
that because she can't get a boyfriend.

04:29.670 --> 04:33.799
[gasps] Or, he thinks I'm some
pervert sex-freak who has to do...

04:33.882 --> 04:35.676
that in math class. Oh.

04:35.759 --> 04:38.053
Uh, I sit next to you in math.

04:38.136 --> 04:40.096
- [sighs]
- Just tell him you don't.

04:40.180 --> 04:44.184
But he's a grade 11. What if
he wants me to be a sex-freak?

04:44.267 --> 04:46.394
[sighs] This is a total disaster.

04:46.477 --> 04:47.729
You've been on one date.

04:47.813 --> 04:51.441
Which is exactly how all of
history's greatest romances started.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.528
I'm gonna try and hit the
girls' room before class.

04:55.611 --> 04:57.113
- Wish me luck.
- [Lola] Bye.

05:00.491 --> 05:03.286
- [sighs]
- Hey, do you really believe all that?

05:03.369 --> 05:04.830
The loser-pervert stuff?

05:04.913 --> 05:06.497
I mean, we're supposed
to think that, but...

05:06.581 --> 05:07.958
Oh, my God, you do it.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.625
- Shh!
- [gasps]

05:09.710 --> 05:12.253
Not all the time or anything.

05:13.714 --> 05:14.715
How?

05:16.758 --> 05:17.884
I don't know.

05:18.885 --> 05:21.805
In the shower, like... [inhales]

05:21.888 --> 05:23.181
- with the shower head...
- [gasps]

05:23.264 --> 05:25.433
Okay, shut it down.
I... This isn't about me.

05:25.516 --> 05:28.144
It's about figuring out what
you're gonna say to Tiny.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.520
[exhales]

05:32.023 --> 05:33.108
What does it feel like?

05:37.320 --> 05:39.280
[stuttering]

05:39.364 --> 05:40.365
[giggles]

05:43.910 --> 05:45.036
[Mr. Mitchell] Miles.

05:47.205 --> 05:50.000
Your short story's really
good now. I loved the changes,

05:50.083 --> 05:51.835
and the <i>Interpreter</i> loved it, too.

05:51.918 --> 05:53.754
They're gonna publish it
and do a profile on you.

05:53.837 --> 05:55.380
- Seriously?
- Yep.

05:55.463 --> 05:57.298
Oh, my mom's gonna flip. [inhales]

05:57.382 --> 05:59.092
You know, I actually went
to J-school with Rodrigo.

05:59.175 --> 06:00.260
He's a great guy.

06:00.343 --> 06:01.594
He'll be at your place for the interview.

06:01.677 --> 06:04.890
He wants to see what home life
is like for a literary genius?

06:04.973 --> 06:07.183
- [both chuckle]
- And to ask you about your short story,

06:07.267 --> 06:08.268
what it's about.

06:10.561 --> 06:12.272
Uh, it's my dad.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.986
Hey, if you're not up for it, I
can put someone else's name forward.

06:18.069 --> 06:20.405
No, no, I've... I've got it.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here

06:29.956 --> 06:31.917
How, exactly, do you "got this"?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.626
You know it's so messed
up that when I'm happy,

06:33.709 --> 06:35.170
everybody sounds the alarm.

06:35.253 --> 06:37.255
Maybe because it's a warning.

06:41.092 --> 06:42.427
What are these?

06:43.011 --> 06:45.763
- Uh, what did you say they were?
- Um, lorazepam?

06:45.847 --> 06:48.141
Which weren't prescribed to you.

06:48.224 --> 06:50.226
Look, these anxiety meds
can be super addictive.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.896
Can you tell this narc over
here that they aren't addictive?

06:52.979 --> 06:54.272
Let me ask you this. Do they help?

06:54.355 --> 06:55.440
That's not an answer.

06:55.523 --> 06:58.109
Well, I don't want to have
to take them, like, forever.

06:58.193 --> 06:59.777
Why not? You eat food every day.

06:59.861 --> 07:02.363
- That's not the same thing.
- People drink coffee every day.

07:02.447 --> 07:04.032
They're anxiety meds, not lattes.

07:04.115 --> 07:05.826
[Esme] We all do things to
cope with the crushing fear

07:05.909 --> 07:06.952
of our inevitable mortality.

07:07.035 --> 07:09.245
But you're only supposed to take
these a couple weeks at a time.

07:09.329 --> 07:10.746
Okay, what happens if I stop?

07:12.540 --> 07:14.667
You spontaneously... combust.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.252
Be serious.

07:16.336 --> 07:17.753
[Esme] This charming young
man you've been lately

07:17.838 --> 07:21.091
goes back to being a nervous
mess anytime anyone whispers,

07:21.174 --> 07:23.343
- [whispers] "Daddy."
- [scoffs]

07:23.426 --> 07:25.678
[Winston] Look, popping these
pills like they're candy,

07:25.761 --> 07:27.806
that's as messed up as she is.

07:35.396 --> 07:37.482
Hey, guys! I got another gig.

07:37.565 --> 07:39.775
- Oh, that's my girl.
- [Maya chuckles]

07:43.779 --> 07:45.656
- [sighs]
- You're not, like, a feminist now, right?

07:45.740 --> 07:47.700
It's pronounced "feminazi."

07:47.783 --> 07:49.535
- [Maya scoffs]
- They support women, dummies.

07:49.619 --> 07:50.703
Yeah, at the expense of men.

07:50.786 --> 07:52.705
[Tiny] They think the world
would be better off without us.

07:52.788 --> 07:53.915
Are you referring to feminists,

07:53.999 --> 07:55.876
or your little girlfriend
who's been ignoring your texts?

07:55.959 --> 07:58.044
Okay, look, I'm pretty
sure it's about equality.

07:58.128 --> 07:59.254
Well, if it's about equality,

07:59.337 --> 08:01.006
then why are they trying to
take one of our bathrooms?

08:01.089 --> 08:03.967
Look, right now we have
five and you have five.

08:04.050 --> 08:06.802
If they take one, that's six and four.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.931
Oh. Yeah, that doesn't seem really equal.

08:10.015 --> 08:12.725
But nobody uses the tech hall
bathroom. Isn't it always empty?

08:12.808 --> 08:16.146
Not empty. Just... private.

08:17.063 --> 08:20.150
- I use it to...
- Return a book to the library.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.610
Deliver a package... by airmail.

08:22.693 --> 08:25.196
- [Maya and Grace scoff]
- Participate in a slam dunk competition.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.532
Okay, gross. You poo. We get it.

08:27.615 --> 08:29.117
But can't you do that in any bathroom?

08:30.410 --> 08:32.495
Well, you know I get
gun-shy if people can hear.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.246
Come on, you delicate flower.

08:34.330 --> 08:35.664
Our bathrooms are always packed.

08:35.748 --> 08:37.167
Well, girls need to be more efficient.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.044
Unfortunately, we lack some of the
hardware necessary to use urinals.

08:40.128 --> 08:42.923
Look, I will be front
row at any of your gigs,

08:43.006 --> 08:45.175
but equal should mean equal.

08:57.478 --> 08:58.771
[water running]

09:29.302 --> 09:30.971
[Rodrigo] It's... It's
really, really great.

09:32.763 --> 09:34.349
How long you been writing?

09:35.391 --> 09:38.311
Since kindergarten. Three R's, you know?

09:38.394 --> 09:40.939
I really, uh, took to 'em.

09:41.022 --> 09:43.316
[chuckles] I... I mean, creatively.

09:47.612 --> 09:50.031
Uh... a month?

09:50.115 --> 09:52.617
Uh, I never really thought I was any good

09:52.700 --> 09:54.577
- before Mr. Mitchell, so...
- Well, it's...

09:54.660 --> 09:56.997
It's important to have a mentor. [chuckles]

09:57.080 --> 10:00.291
Okay, uh, tell me a little bit about
<i>Taking Off the Training Wheels.</i>

10:02.418 --> 10:03.419
[clears throat]

10:04.379 --> 10:05.588
Uh, well, you...

10:06.547 --> 10:08.216
It's a short story about...

10:09.259 --> 10:11.511
learning how to ride a bike.

10:11.594 --> 10:16.057
Well, more specifically,
learning from your dad, right?

10:18.268 --> 10:20.811
Yeah, yeah, yeah... I guess, yeah.

10:22.480 --> 10:25.483
Uh, with whom the main character

10:25.566 --> 10:29.195
seems to have a pretty
complicated relationship.

10:32.282 --> 10:33.949
[breath trembling]

10:36.744 --> 10:38.829
[line ringing]

10:41.457 --> 10:42.958
[shuddering]

10:43.043 --> 10:44.335
I need you.

10:44.419 --> 10:46.171
[Esme] <i>Three little words</i>
<i>every girl wants to hear.</i>

10:46.254 --> 10:48.298
[stuttering]

10:48.381 --> 10:49.465
I can't breathe.

10:50.550 --> 10:54.137
Did you go off the pills cold
turkey? I told you not to.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.597
- Take one now. <i>
- I flushed them.</i>

10:57.932 --> 10:59.809
[panting] I feel...

10:59.892 --> 11:03.646
I... I feel like my heart's gonna explode.

11:03.729 --> 11:06.316
<i>Okay. Uh, this is a garden
variety panic attack.</i>

11:06.399 --> 11:07.817
<i>I'll walk you through it.</i>

11:07.900 --> 11:09.444
<i>Start by breathing into your belly.</i>

11:10.528 --> 11:12.488
[whimpering]

11:17.785 --> 11:19.079
[doctor] Okay.

11:20.330 --> 11:21.456
[inhales]

11:22.457 --> 11:24.209
Tickety-boo.

11:24.292 --> 11:26.169
You are a picture of health,

11:26.252 --> 11:28.338
so we'll see you again next year.

11:29.672 --> 11:30.673
[sighs]

11:32.175 --> 11:33.676
Unless there's something else?

11:33.759 --> 11:34.927
[sighs]

11:37.472 --> 11:38.556
I'm broken.

11:38.639 --> 11:43.353
Okay. Um, I literally
just did a full check-up.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.438
Any specific part of you?

11:45.521 --> 11:47.607
My <i>argolla.</i>

11:47.690 --> 11:50.526
Your vagina? Did you do something to it?

11:50.610 --> 11:53.529
Yes, and nothing happened.

11:53.779 --> 11:55.323
- I'm getting old.
- [sighs]

11:55.406 --> 11:57.325
You're gonna have to spell this out for me.

11:57.408 --> 12:00.870
I just found out that my friend has been...

12:00.953 --> 12:02.247
having some alone time.

12:02.330 --> 12:04.790
- Masturbating?
- Yeah, that, and...

12:05.750 --> 12:08.586
I thought I should try...

12:08.669 --> 12:11.222
that, and it didn't work.

12:11.316 --> 12:12.257
It didn't feel good?

12:12.340 --> 12:17.387
[sighs] I mean, it felt
okay, like, I didn't...

12:17.470 --> 12:19.264
Have an orgasm?

12:19.776 --> 12:21.152
[sighs deeply] Oh, dear.

12:21.230 --> 12:23.184
Am I abnormal? I knew it. Oh.

12:23.268 --> 12:25.353
[chuckling] Lola, you're
definitely not normal.

12:25.436 --> 12:26.521
Oh! <i>Dios mío.</i>

12:26.604 --> 12:28.856
[chuckles] But because there is no normal.

12:28.939 --> 12:30.441
Everyone is different,

12:30.525 --> 12:33.403
so different things
work for different women.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.364
Not everybody orgasms every time.

12:36.447 --> 12:38.658
Um, so what do I have to do? Physio?

12:38.741 --> 12:41.409
Relax. Here.

12:43.727 --> 12:45.050
Read this.

12:46.791 --> 12:48.459
Get to know yourself.

12:48.543 --> 12:52.547
It's a normal thing to do, and
it's supposed to be enjoyable.

12:52.630 --> 12:53.756
Okay?

12:55.508 --> 12:57.302
[sighs]

12:57.385 --> 13:00.930
How about one that says,
"Inequality has got to go"?

13:01.013 --> 13:02.265
[chuckles] Get it?

13:02.348 --> 13:03.766
Maya, such a pleasure.

13:03.849 --> 13:05.935
Uh, shall we discuss your technical needs?

13:06.018 --> 13:08.062
- Actually, I can't do the show.
- Oh.

13:08.145 --> 13:10.273
[sighs] That's such a disappointment.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.317
I just don't feel like I'm a feminist.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.068
- No offense.
- None taken.

13:14.151 --> 13:17.280
But, uh, just out of curiosity,
what makes you say that?

13:17.363 --> 13:20.157
Well, for one, I'm not anti-men.

13:20.241 --> 13:23.828
[chuckling] And we're
all horrible man-haters?

13:23.911 --> 13:27.039
Well, no, but stealing
one of the boys' washrooms

13:27.122 --> 13:29.250
just doesn't seem very equal.

13:29.334 --> 13:31.336
[sighs] Tell me this.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.128
Do you think that men and women

13:33.213 --> 13:35.047
should be paid the same
salary for the same job?

13:35.130 --> 13:36.131
Yeah, for sure.

13:36.216 --> 13:39.677
And do you think that boys and girls
should have the same access to education?

13:39.760 --> 13:41.804
I think that's pretty obvious.

13:41.887 --> 13:43.473
Yet this school ignores the fact

13:43.556 --> 13:45.433
that boys and girls use
washrooms differently.

13:45.516 --> 13:47.393
Have you ever waited in line?

13:47.477 --> 13:50.313
- I think we all have.
- Not boys.

13:50.396 --> 13:54.317
And with only seven minute breaks,
this makes girls late for class

13:54.400 --> 13:56.736
and causes them to miss
lessons, and get detention.

13:56.819 --> 14:00.534
Hmm. I never... I never thought
of that. [chuckles softly]

14:00.740 --> 14:04.495
And wouldn't you say that this gives
girls a worse education than boys?

14:04.581 --> 14:05.703
Yeah, I would.

14:05.786 --> 14:09.206
Well, then I have news
for you, Maya Matlin.

14:09.290 --> 14:11.041
You are a feminist.

14:11.125 --> 14:12.293
[chuckles]

14:23.513 --> 14:26.349
- Are you sure we'll find pills?
- Girls in grade 10 gym?

14:26.432 --> 14:28.351
Can you name a group of
people with more anxiety?

14:28.434 --> 14:29.519
[unzips bag]

14:29.602 --> 14:31.687
[sighs] Look for anything
that says uptight.

14:31.771 --> 14:33.439
Two-strap backpacks.

14:33.523 --> 14:35.691
You see that girl Shay's stuff anywhere?

14:35.775 --> 14:37.735
I can't believe you didn't
fill your scripts this week.

14:37.818 --> 14:40.154
Hey, I can't believe you'd
flush what I gave you.

14:40.238 --> 14:41.489
So we're even.

14:42.948 --> 14:44.409
[breath trembling] What
if we don't find any?

14:44.492 --> 14:46.452
I lost it when I had to talk about my dad.

14:46.536 --> 14:49.289
In, like, an hour, at my brother's
gaming thing, I have to talk to him.

14:49.372 --> 14:51.249
And I'm sure that you'll be fine.

14:53.418 --> 14:56.003
I know I will, because of these.

14:57.004 --> 14:58.714
They'll do in a pinch,
but the dosage is higher

14:58.798 --> 15:00.300
than you're used to,
and the effects are fast.

15:00.383 --> 15:01.592
Sounds good to me.

15:01.676 --> 15:03.135
[breathing heavily]

15:05.012 --> 15:07.765
[Mrs. Lin] So, remember, you can
use any or part of this pattern

15:07.848 --> 15:10.518
to suggest that an action
or verb is in progress.

15:11.226 --> 15:13.228
[speaking Mandarin]

15:13.313 --> 15:15.064
- Frankie?
- "They are singing."

15:15.147 --> 15:16.607
Very good.

15:16.691 --> 15:17.692
How about...

15:17.775 --> 15:19.444
[speaks Mandarin]

15:19.527 --> 15:22.780
- Shay?
- "They are... laughing"?

15:22.863 --> 15:25.741
Trick question. That is
also, "They are singing."

15:27.285 --> 15:28.328
How about...

15:28.411 --> 15:30.162
[speaks Mandarin]

15:30.245 --> 15:31.581
- Lola?
- Huh?

15:31.664 --> 15:35.250
It means, "She is reading,"
but what is she reading?

15:36.251 --> 15:37.920
Care to share with the rest of the class?

15:38.003 --> 15:39.672
Uh, no, no. That's okay. [chuckles]

15:40.673 --> 15:41.799
[speaks Mandarin]

15:41.882 --> 15:43.384
That means, "I insist."

[stutters]

Go on.

15:54.354 --> 15:57.607
"Masturbation is the stimulation
or manipulation of the genitals."

15:57.690 --> 15:58.983
[students laughing]

15:59.066 --> 16:00.693
[Mrs. Lin] Okay, okay, settle down.

16:00.776 --> 16:03.363
This is nothing to be
embarrassed about. Now, focus.

16:03.446 --> 16:04.530
[mouthing] Sorry.

_

16:17.222 --> 16:19.642
Uh, until further notice,
this washroom's out of order.

16:20.560 --> 16:21.769
This is ridiculous.

16:23.437 --> 16:26.857
Maya, can you please tell her
that I need to use this bathroom?

16:27.942 --> 16:29.484
- [Maya sighs]
- You too, Maya?

16:30.152 --> 16:33.531
Zig, there are four other perfectly
good boys' bathrooms that you could use.

16:33.615 --> 16:34.700
But you know that I can't...

16:34.783 --> 16:37.786
Girls have to deal with that every
day. Maybe now it's your turn.

16:37.869 --> 16:38.995
Sorry.

16:42.874 --> 16:44.500
Okay, everyone, let's
get this party started.

- Vijay, drop a blind.
- Sir, yes, sir.

17:09.150 --> 17:11.152
- [Hunter] Baaz, drop it.
- [Baaz] Ready to drop.

17:11.778 --> 17:13.905
Target annihilated. Let's do this.

17:13.989 --> 17:15.240
[Frankie] Hunter's killing it.

17:15.323 --> 17:16.782
Is Hunter killing it?

17:16.867 --> 17:17.992
I don't really know what's happening.

17:18.076 --> 17:20.036
Yeah, I... I think he
just killed a furry guy.

17:20.119 --> 17:22.789
Of course he's killing it. He's
a Hollingsworth. Right, Dad?

17:22.873 --> 17:24.124
Hmm?

Let's go, Hunter. Let's go, Hunter.

Let's go, Hunter.

Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just...

- Uh... long day.

18:03.079 --> 18:04.873
We had a quiz.

18:04.956 --> 18:06.499
I have known you since you
were in diapers, Winston.

18:06.582 --> 18:08.251
Don't lie to me.

18:08.334 --> 18:09.753
[softly] Okay.

You were getting published.

I'm trying to be the son
that you want me to be.

18:42.452 --> 18:45.121
No, you're not. You were high at school.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.792
What, you think this is funny?

18:48.875 --> 18:51.336
No, you're right. This is terrible.

I'm a terrible kid.

[Lola] I've been off all
my socials for five hours.

19:09.229 --> 19:10.689
Is everyone talking about me?

19:10.772 --> 19:11.982
I can't bear to look.

19:12.065 --> 19:14.650
Well, they're not not talking about you.

19:16.444 --> 19:18.446
Why were you even reading that, anyway?

19:18.471 --> 19:20.240
Because. We never talk about it.

19:20.323 --> 19:22.784
- It's kind of private.
- Guys talk about this stuff all the time.

19:22.868 --> 19:25.370
Eggplant, fist, rain drops.

wanna stop talking.</i>

seem really smart.

- "Actually"?
- Well, I mean,

I think your parents

Look... I'm sorry I blew
your secret to your mom.

Well, you don't have to worry anymore.

She trashed my room
searching for contraband.

21:17.607 --> 21:20.151
- Well, did she find any?
- No. And she won't

21:20.235 --> 21:21.987
because she doesn't know where to look.

Where did you get those?

have to do that, all right?

21:35.666 --> 21:37.252
If you really have anxiety,

21:37.335 --> 21:38.879
I can get you help from
a doctor or something.

21:38.962 --> 21:41.006
I'm done trying to be
everyone's favorite son.

21:45.135 --> 21:47.929
If you're always a disappointment,
then it's impossible to disappoint.

21:53.351 --> 21:56.021
Hey! I got your text. Why the grin?

21:56.104 --> 22:00.191
Well, thanks in part to your
help, we got our 200 signatures

22:00.275 --> 22:01.943
and the support of the parents' council.

22:02.027 --> 22:03.069
Which means we did it?

22:03.153 --> 22:05.571
Indeed! Would you like to do the honors,

22:05.655 --> 22:07.615
or will that only further
upset your boyfriend?

22:07.698 --> 22:09.242
- No, he's cool.
- [Goldi chuckles]

22:09.325 --> 22:11.369
I mean, I explained to him how
equality doesn't always mean

22:11.452 --> 22:13.038
everything is equal.

22:13.121 --> 22:14.455
And now he's just gonna have to learn

22:14.539 --> 22:16.374
to not eat two burritos every lunch hour.

22:16.457 --> 22:17.959
[all laugh]

22:18.043 --> 22:20.185
And you should do it. It was your idea.

22:20.378 --> 22:21.421
[sighs]

22:24.549 --> 22:25.550
[Maya chuckles]

22:26.634 --> 22:28.469
[girls cheer and applaud]

22:28.553 --> 22:30.346
- [Maya] So what's next?
- What do you mean?

22:30.430 --> 22:32.182
Are you kidding? This was awesome.

22:32.265 --> 22:33.599
I'm joining the freakin' club.

22:33.683 --> 22:36.352
[laughs] Well, in that case...

22:38.146 --> 22:39.397
From the video game competition...

22:39.480 --> 22:41.232
The one that was here at school yesterday?

22:41.316 --> 22:43.401
[Goldi] Using the school's
name, and the school's money...

22:43.484 --> 22:46.571
To celebrate dudes practically
murdering half-naked women?

22:47.155 --> 22:48.823
It doesn't seem right, does it?

22:49.907 --> 22:51.909
[triumphant instrumental music playing]
