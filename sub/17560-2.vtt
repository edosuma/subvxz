a thank you? No.

I didn't know his middle name.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.237
Look, this is all
just moving really fast.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.656
I thought this was gonna be
a fun European fling.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.701
Fling? You haven't even flung.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.661
Okay, why am I
even talking to you?

11:02.745 --> 11:05.247
Because I have experience.
I've been around.

11:05.331 --> 11:08.042
Yeah, and around
and around and around.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.294
Look, all I'm saying
is you like him

11:10.378 --> 11:11.587
he lives for you, what..

11:11.670 --> 11:14.382
I know, but it just
doesn't feel right.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.842
- I'm sorry, but it's weird.
- No, it's not weird.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.469
You're weird.
You know what?

11:18.552 --> 11:20.388
I'm gonna call Val.
She'll tell me if it's weird.

11:20.471 --> 11:23.224
By the way,
she thinks you're weird.

11:23.307 --> 11:24.475
You know what,
I can't call Val.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.769
I don't need to talk to Val.
I'm an adult.

11:26.852 --> 11:30.189
You know what, you're right.
And you know what adults do?

11:30.272 --> 11:33.609
They do it.
Now get in there and give it up.

11:33.692 --> 11:35.194
Ah.

11:41.700 --> 11:45.121
You know, so what if Holly
doesn't wanna live here anymore.

11:45.204 --> 11:49.458
Fine with me. I don't need her
getting all up in my grill.

11:51.710 --> 11:52.920
Okay, how drunk are you?

11:53.003 --> 11:55.423
Like, on a scale of one
to Courtney Love?

11:57.007 --> 11:59.051
I just said
getting up in my grill.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.178
- What do you think?
- Okay, good.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.931
Then you probably won't remember
that I said this in the morning.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.058
Do you think
maybe you overreacted

12:06.142 --> 12:08.519
just a little bit
to the whole Ben thing?

12:08.602 --> 12:09.895
No.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.607
Wow, you're a mean drunk.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.151
Okay. What?

12:15.234 --> 12:17.445
Maybe you should ask yourself
why you really didn't want

12:17.528 --> 12:19.738
Ben staying here. I mean,
he could've stayed on the couch.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.491
And he came here all the way
from England to be with Holly.

12:22.575 --> 12:26.454
Exactly. And what if next month
he decides to dump Holly

12:26.537 --> 12:28.956
to go back to England,
Britain, the UK?

12:29.039 --> 12:31.792
Wh-why can't they pick a name?

12:31.876 --> 12:33.627
I gotta clean.

12:35.212 --> 12:38.090
I just don't want Holly falling
for him and getting hurt.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.758
Well, how do you know
she'll get hurt?

12:39.842 --> 12:42.636
Because someone always does.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.181
I mean, look what just
happened with me and Rick.

12:45.264 --> 12:48.726
- Yeah, Rick got hurt.
- Rick? What about me?

12:48.809 --> 12:50.686
You're the one
who broke off the engagement.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.230
But I am still hurting.

12:54.940 --> 12:58.110
Of course, you are,
because you still love him.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.530
Oh, I need my Swiffer.

13:06.243 --> 13:09.413
Okay, you know, I think
I'm gonna tell you what I think

13:09.497 --> 13:11.123
and I pray I've had
enough champagne

13:11.207 --> 13:12.500
that it won't hurt
when you hit me.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.585
I don't wanna hear it.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.423
Alright, what?

13:19.507 --> 13:20.841
I think you really love Rick

13:20.925 --> 13:22.718
but you broke up with him
'cause you're a scaredy-cat.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.428
You were afraid
he was gonna break up with you

13:24.512 --> 13:26.138
because your last
two boyfriends did.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.973
And now you're scared
Ben's gonna do the same thing

13:28.057 --> 13:30.184
to Holly and you're all messed
up and now you're turning

13:30.267 --> 13:31.769
Holly into a scaredy-cat too.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.187
[gasps]

13:34.563 --> 13:37.149
Just watch the nose.
I can't get it done again.

13:43.447 --> 13:45.199
Holly, are you sure you're okay?

13:45.282 --> 13:48.536
Yeah, of course, I'm okay.
Totally cool.

13:48.619 --> 13:49.745
Do you realize
this is the first time

13:49.828 --> 13:51.080
we've spent the night together?

13:51.163 --> 13:52.665
Oh, yeah.

13:52.748 --> 13:56.001
- Are you okay with it?
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.586
- Uh, are you okay?
- Yes.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.422
<i>No! I'm a mess. I'm not weird.</i>

14:00.506 --> 14:03.092
<i>I'm not weird. I am so weird.</i>

14:03.175 --> 14:06.470
<i>Well, at least I don't look</i>
<i>as uncomfortable as I feel.</i>

14:11.684 --> 14:13.769
You know, we're never gonna do

14:13.852 --> 14:15.563
anything that you're not
ready for.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.606
Oh, of course, I'm totally cool.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.817
- Hit the hay, dude.
- Okay.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.319
Uh, if you don't mind,
I usually sleep in my boxers.

14:22.403 --> 14:25.698
- Whatever you're cool with.
- Alright, boxers, it is.

14:25.781 --> 14:29.034
Uh, if it helps, they've got
little duckies on them.

14:29.118 --> 14:32.371
<i>Aww, I love duckies.</i>

14:32.454 --> 14:35.666
<i>This is good.</i>
<i>Maybe I can do this.</i>

14:42.715 --> 14:44.258
<i>Okay.</i>

14:44.341 --> 14:47.636
<i>Okay, this is nice.</i>

14:47.720 --> 14:50.389
<i>He's on his side.</i>
<i>I'm on my side.</i>

14:53.684 --> 14:58.439
<i>Aww. That's sweet.</i>
<i>He wants to spoon.</i>

14:58.522 --> 15:00.941
<i>Why did I get myself</i>
<i>so worked up?</i>

15:02.818 --> 15:04.445
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

15:04.528 --> 15:07.573
<i>Duckies are moving.</i>
<i>Duckies are moving.</i>

15:10.326 --> 15:12.745
I'm just gonna get
a drink of water.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.845
What are you doing here?

15:29.928 --> 15:33.682
I, um, needed a drink of water.

15:33.766 --> 15:37.936
Oh. They don't have water
wherever it is you're staying?

15:38.020 --> 15:41.607
I'm staying at Vince's
and, um, all he had was beer.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.278
So how's it been living
on your own?

15:47.780 --> 15:50.115
It's had its ups and downs.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.206
How have things been with you?

15:57.289 --> 15:59.416
How's the old job?

16:00.959 --> 16:03.879
You moved out three hours ago.

16:03.962 --> 16:06.882
Kinda late to be coming
all this way for water.

16:06.965 --> 16:09.385
Kinda late to be doing laundry.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.512
Although, I guess
you have to do it sometime.

16:11.595 --> 16:13.764
Otherwise you're weird
if you don't.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.142
What?

16:17.226 --> 16:23.315
Ben and I haven't exactly
done laundry yet.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.236
Well, you just got back
from Europe.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.738
No one expects you
to have done your laundry yet.

16:31.490 --> 16:34.118
But we've been together
for three weeks.

16:34.201 --> 16:36.328
We're supposed to have
done our laundry.

16:36.412 --> 16:39.748
Everybody's done it.
Vince's done it. Gary's done it.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.209
Tina's like
a friggin' laundromat.

16:46.672 --> 16:47.589
H-Holly, what are you--

16:47.673 --> 16:48.924
Follow the bread crumbs, Hansel.

16:49.007 --> 16:51.093
I haven't had sex
with Ben yet!

16:53.011 --> 16:54.930
- What?
- Am I weird?

16:55.013 --> 16:56.348
Is there something wrong
with me?

16:56.432 --> 16:57.725
No, no, no, no, no.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.601
Oh, there's nothing
wrong with you.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.937
Oh, thank you.

17:02.020 --> 17:04.356
Mm-hmm, okay, here's what
you need to do, you..

17:06.858 --> 17:10.194
You know what?
You will figure it out.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.950
That's your big advice?

17:15.032 --> 17:17.118
Okay, what happened
to my overprotective

17:17.202 --> 17:20.038
in-my-face sister who wouldn't
let me play Ms. Pac-Man

17:20.122 --> 17:23.083
because she thought
that she made bad choices?

17:25.127 --> 17:28.630
- I need her.
- No, I'm not so sure you do.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.675
I mean, you said yourself,
you're 18 years old.

17:31.759 --> 17:35.596
Exactly.
I am only 18 years old.

17:39.516 --> 17:41.602
So what do I do?

17:43.187 --> 17:45.522
Well, what do you think
you should do?

17:45.606 --> 17:49.109
I think that you should
tell me what to do.

17:50.652 --> 17:54.156
No, I'm serious.
How will you really know

17:54.239 --> 17:56.033
when you're ready
to be with someone?

17:56.116 --> 17:58.827
When I don't need to come to you
and ask you if I'm ready?

17:58.911 --> 18:01.079
- Yes.
- Yay.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.624
I'm so much better
at this than Tina.

18:05.083 --> 18:06.794
Tina.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.131
- So can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.175
Can I come home?

18:13.258 --> 18:15.552
Vince's couch smells like butt.

18:17.471 --> 18:20.474
Of course, you can come home.

18:20.557 --> 18:23.685
Just promise me
one thing that, uh

18:23.769 --> 18:26.522
no matter what decision
you make about Ben

18:26.605 --> 18:29.191
don't do it or not do it
because you're afraid

18:29.274 --> 18:31.860
that somewhere down the line,
it won't work out.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.614
Oh, no. That's all your crap,
not mine.

18:35.697 --> 18:39.201
Wait-wait a second.
You know about my crap?

18:39.284 --> 18:42.830
Val, when I was three, you made
Barbie break up with Ken

18:42.913 --> 18:45.541
because you were afraid
that Ken would leave her.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.628
Yeah, well, the-the dog
chewed her head off.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.005
I was just trying
to beat Ken to the punch.

18:54.174 --> 18:57.052
- Can I ask you one more thing?
- What?

18:57.135 --> 19:01.098
Did you break off the engagement
to beat Rick to the punch?

19:01.181 --> 19:03.350
[mumbles]
I don't know.
Well, I don't know.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.770
Do you love him?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.606
Do you wanna be with him?

19:11.191 --> 19:13.986
Even if the dog chews
his head off?

19:16.071 --> 19:17.739
Well.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.491
You know, I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.618
I can't just bang on Rick's door
at 2 o'clock in the morning.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.078
[knocks]
I can.

19:23.161 --> 19:24.496
Please don't be
having rebound sex.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.790
Please don't be
having rebound sex.

19:26.874 --> 19:29.001
Oh, well, we tried.
Let's go.

19:29.084 --> 19:31.003
Val?

19:31.086 --> 19:33.130
Rick. Hi.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.468
Look, I know I said that
I didn't wanna marry you

19:38.552 --> 19:40.429
but I only said that
because I was scared.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.598
But I'd rather be scared
and have you in my life

19:42.681 --> 19:44.099
even if it means that
someday you might dump me

19:44.182 --> 19:45.893
than be scared and not have you
in my life at all.

19:45.976 --> 19:47.227
And I'm not saying any of this

19:47.311 --> 19:48.687
because I want you to ask me
to marry you again.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.273
I just really wanted you
to know where I stand, okay?

19:51.356 --> 19:54.401
So thank you for listening
to me humiliate myself.

19:55.903 --> 19:58.363
Really sexy
when you just get up.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.951
(Rick)
'Will you marry me?'

20:07.372 --> 20:09.166
He can't hear a nod.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.711
Yes.

20:12.794 --> 20:15.547
- Yes?
- She said yes. Yay.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.011
Yay!

20:23.847 --> 20:26.600
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Alone time.

20:27.893 --> 20:31.230
Hey, go do some laundry.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.982
Man, how'd she get through
the summer without me?

20:40.072 --> 20:41.865
[theme music]
