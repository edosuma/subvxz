WEBVTT

01:49.067 --> 01:51.278
Are you sure this is okay?
I mean, I don't wanna--

01:51.945 --> 01:53.405
I don't wanna get you in trouble.

01:53.405 --> 01:54.698
It's most definitely not okay,

01:54.698 --> 01:57.075
but if we get caught,
it's gonna be worth it.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.330
Hi. He's with me.

02:02.915 --> 02:03.916
Thank you.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.966
- What is this?
- My happy place.

02:23.810 --> 02:24.770
Okay. Next tray.

02:26.688 --> 02:27.689
- The corner?
- Corner.

02:27.689 --> 02:31.068
- Yep.
- Gently. Into the stopper.

02:33.028 --> 02:34.196
- Same way or...
- Up.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.114
- Facing up. Yeah.
- Up?

02:37.616 --> 02:39.243
- Very nice.
- Nice.

02:43.956 --> 02:46.667
So, did Nicky like that present?

02:46.667 --> 02:48.043
The book you got him?

02:49.169 --> 02:50.170
Yeah, he did.

02:53.966 --> 02:54.967
Cool.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.513
Fresh tongs, Charles.

03:00.013 --> 03:04.101
Don't cross the streams, okay?

03:05.227 --> 03:06.395
Okay. Sorry.

03:09.940 --> 03:12.234
Do you and Nicky hang out a lot, or...

03:13.485 --> 03:14.486
I guess so.

03:16.989 --> 03:19.074
I try to spend as much time
with him as I can.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.827
I feel like I have a lot
to learn from him.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.665
Just like you have a lot to learn from me.

03:31.837 --> 03:32.963
You ready for the wash?

03:32.963 --> 03:34.173
Yeah. Yes.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.263
Thank you.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.726
Just make sure you press it
all the way down.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.272
'Cause you wanna finish strong.

04:08.582 --> 04:12.252
Okay. Twenty-four frames, black-and-white.

04:12.252 --> 04:17.048
That is 16.99 including tax.
Be ready tomorrow. Pay when you pick up.

04:17.798 --> 04:20.719
Cool. That'll give me some time
to get my hands on 16.99,

04:21.220 --> 04:23.972
which I will do,
'cause that film is very valuable.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.057
To me, I mean.

04:25.641 --> 04:26.767
Oh, yeah?

04:28.644 --> 04:30.979
Yeah. Do we have some kind of agreement,

04:30.979 --> 04:32.981
like a doctor-patient
confidentiality thing?

04:33.774 --> 04:36.401
I mean, I have that
with Dr. Altschul, my therapist.

04:36.401 --> 04:40.239
Right. Definitely not, but don't worry.

04:40.239 --> 04:45.077
I've seen it all.
Nudity, dead bodies, every kind of sex.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.913
I mean, what's on this roll?
Can it top that?

04:48.956 --> 04:50.999
Please, if we could just
keep this between us.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.960
Cone of silence, brother.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.590
<i>There are no secrets
in the city of New York.</i>

04:58.590 --> 05:01.760
Someone saw something, heard something.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.263
Plus, you're shedding hair
and fibers 24-7,

05:04.263 --> 05:06.139
- leaving fingerprints--
- Bodily fluids.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.349
There's cameras everywhere.

05:07.349 --> 05:10.018
Credit card receipts,
phone records, parking tickets--

05:10.018 --> 05:12.020
Berkowitz got caught on a parking ticket.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.481
Exactly. The city always knows.

05:15.274 --> 05:17.359
When I told you the girl in the park
was Samantha Yeung,

05:17.359 --> 05:19.236
it didn't seem like fresh information.

05:20.195 --> 05:23.073
Her name hasn't been made public,
so you know this how?

05:23.073 --> 05:24.408
My wife, actually.

05:24.408 --> 05:25.659
You mean your ex-wife?

05:25.659 --> 05:27.244
She's not my ex yet.

05:28.245 --> 05:31.164
Regan told me that an NYU student
had been shot on the Fourth

05:31.164 --> 05:32.958
in the park across from her father's.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.835
There's 40,000 students at NYU.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.796
About half of them are girls.
Why think it was her?

05:37.796 --> 05:42.593
I didn't necessarily think it was,
but it made me wanna check in on her.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.096
When she didn't return my calls,
I went to the dorm--

05:50.517 --> 05:51.518
The city always knows.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.984
Then I went to the hospital.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.944
Paper said where she was.
I wasn't allowed in,

06:00.944 --> 06:04.615
but I heard this random song
that she likes, and I knew.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.659
Where were you when Sam was shot?

06:09.203 --> 06:12.539
Home. I was home alone.

06:14.082 --> 06:17.503
It's not the best alibi,
but not the worst.

06:18.629 --> 06:21.673
- It's tough for you to prove.
- Well, it's also tough for us to disprove.

06:21.673 --> 06:24.927
You can ask my doorman.
City always knows, right?

06:31.892 --> 06:36.355
This affair you had with a teenager,
if it ever got out,

06:36.355 --> 06:38.023
you would have a lot to lose.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.067
Makes sense that you would want
to shut her up.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.986
Or maybe it just ended,

06:42.986 --> 06:46.490
and she saw you as a fucking pathetic,
middle-aged clichÃ©,

06:46.490 --> 06:47.824
and you didn't like that.

06:49.159 --> 06:52.371
There's no lack of motive.
All you need is a weapon.

06:52.371 --> 06:54.122
You ever own a gun, Mr. Lamplighter?

06:55.499 --> 06:56.500
A gun? No.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.586
Mr. Lamplighter, you're free to go.

07:00.420 --> 07:04.007
He's been free to go this whole time.
He came voluntarily. We're just talking.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.009
- He doesn't have a lawyer.
- He didn't ask for one.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.553
Mr. Lamplighter, please.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.179
I...

07:10.055 --> 07:11.181
This is over.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.351
You heard the boss.

07:19.857 --> 07:23.902
Thank you for your time.
I really hope you figure out who shot her.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.993
It's not me.
This is coming from above.

07:31.994 --> 07:32.995
Who's above you?

07:43.839 --> 07:44.840
Get in.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.599
I guess I should say "thank you."

07:53.599 --> 07:56.768
That's usually how it goes
when someone saves your ass.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.270
I didn't ask for your help.

07:58.270 --> 08:01.106
You didn't have to. You're family.

08:03.108 --> 08:08.280
That gun you gave me,
if I didn't have it anymore,

08:08.280 --> 08:10.115
could it be tracked back to either of us?

08:10.115 --> 08:13.619
You lost the gun, or someone took it?

08:14.369 --> 08:18.081
Was it Regan?
Did she shoot that girl out of jealousy?

08:18.081 --> 08:20.334
No. Absolutely not.

08:20.334 --> 08:21.710
Then who?

08:23.962 --> 08:27.799
Unburden yourself, and start by telling me
what happened to your face.

08:27.799 --> 08:31.053
Like you don't know.
Like they don't work for you.

08:33.972 --> 08:34.972
Stop the car.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.270
Hey, stop, please. Now.

08:43.065 --> 08:45.234
I can keep the police off your back.

08:45.984 --> 08:49.321
My family is my responsibility.
I'm gonna take care of this.

08:49.321 --> 08:52.991
Forgive me if I don't feel confident
about your chances.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.161
Can you open the door, please?

08:56.787 --> 08:57.621
Unlock.

09:06.380 --> 09:11.093
I'm here if you change your mind.
At least, until I change mine.

09:30.153 --> 09:33.490
I tell you,
it's the Hamilton-Sweeney connection.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.035
I gotta learn more about these people.

09:38.287 --> 09:41.790
And spend less time jerking off
into cups and read the paper for once.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.922
Money for generations.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.800
Built our skyline.
Got friends in high places.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.344
This right here,
that's the head of the family.

09:54.344 --> 09:55.971
Billionaire with a B.

09:55.971 --> 09:59.600
And he's about to go down
for some kind of financial crime

09:59.600 --> 10:02.186
I don't totally understand,
but it's a big fucking deal.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.355
What if that's the connection?

10:06.398 --> 10:09.401
Forget about jealousy
or keeping Sam quiet about the affair.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.653
Maybe it's the business.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.363
Maybe, through Lamplighter,

10:13.363 --> 10:15.574
she got wind of something
she wasn't supposed to.

10:16.158 --> 10:18.327
You can bet these rich fucks
will do whatever it takes

10:18.327 --> 10:20.120
to keep dear old Dad out of the MCC.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.750
Maybe tomorrow we go back to their office,
ask some questions.

10:25.334 --> 10:28.253
You know, find a disgruntled employee
or two who's willing to talk.

10:29.880 --> 10:33.133
No one is that fucking happy.
They're hiding something.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.472
Come on, Sam.
What are you trying to tell me?

10:51.902 --> 10:52.903
Of course.

10:53.862 --> 10:57.157
Amory Gould, you motherfucker.

11:15.092 --> 11:17.553
Why is it my fault Charlie's gone?
I'm not the babysitter.

11:17.553 --> 11:19.054
It's not that he's gone
that's the problem.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.806
It's that he was here in the first place.

11:20.806 --> 11:23.517
- He can't be trusted.
- You don't trust anyone, Sol.

11:23.517 --> 11:26.228
Yeah, 'cause the world
is full of fucking traitors.

11:27.145 --> 11:30.065
I like living here.
I actually believe in what we're doing.

11:30.065 --> 11:31.567
And I don't? What--

11:31.567 --> 11:34.152
- What have I been doing this whole--
- Look who I found outside.

11:36.864 --> 11:40.367
Hey. The fuck you been, kid?

11:41.952 --> 11:45.581
- Just out for a walk.
- A walk? You're a wanted fucking man.

11:45.581 --> 11:47.499
No one saw me, all right? Jesus.

11:49.251 --> 11:51.253
Just been frustrated
about not getting anywhere

11:51.253 --> 11:54.339
with what happened to Sam,
and I just thought I'd clear my head.

11:54.339 --> 11:55.632
And it's clear now?

11:56.842 --> 11:58.135
Yeah, totally.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.392
DT, grab some beers.

12:17.696 --> 12:21.909
Charlie, I'm a Pisces,
and you can't bullshit a Pisces.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.994
I can literally see your soul.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.874
Respectfully, I don't think that's true.

12:29.875 --> 12:30.876
Okay, fine.

12:31.835 --> 12:35.547
But I know your head is not clear.
It's cloudy as fuck.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.091
I'm not gonna lie to you.

12:39.343 --> 12:42.971
When I left,
I thought about just going home.

12:43.722 --> 12:44.723
On foot if I had to.

12:44.723 --> 12:47.017
Just whatever it would take
to get back to Flower Hill.

12:47.518 --> 12:48.519
So why didn't you?

12:48.519 --> 12:51.188
Besides the fact
that it's a seven-hour walk?

12:52.731 --> 12:53.732
I just,

12:54.733 --> 12:57.611
kinda realized that I don't have
anything to go back to.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.698
That I've given up my old life.

13:05.244 --> 13:06.578
This is my home now.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.582
Then welcome home, Charlie.

13:16.213 --> 13:17.214
<i>He's lying.</i>

13:18.632 --> 13:21.677
He knows something
or at least suspects the fuck out of it.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.138
Finally seeing things my way.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.975
Cover's been ripped off.
There are pages missing too.

13:28.559 --> 13:30.727
Sometimes Sam used her books as a journal.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.604
Who knows what she wrote down?

13:38.193 --> 13:39.194
Nick.

13:44.116 --> 13:46.451
What the fuck? Don't do that.

13:47.286 --> 13:48.745
You scared the fucking shit outta me.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.873
I told you, don't fucking interrupt me
while I'm working.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.499
That's for your safety as well as mine.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.043
We got a problem.

14:00.382 --> 14:01.383
Thank God.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.012
I wasn't sure
if you were even coming home.

14:08.765 --> 14:09.808
Where's Will?

14:09.808 --> 14:11.518
He's asleep. It's late.

14:13.228 --> 14:14.229
What happened?

14:16.982 --> 14:20.736
They let me go. I didn't say anything.
Nothing they didn't already know.

14:21.695 --> 14:24.323
Well, what else is there?

14:28.785 --> 14:29.786
They...

14:37.836 --> 14:38.962
I had a gun.

14:40.255 --> 14:43.383
I kept it hidden in the closet, in a bag.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.136
It wasn't loaded, of course,
but there was ammunition.

14:47.846 --> 14:51.934
You had a gun in the house.

14:52.726 --> 14:53.810
That gun...

14:56.438 --> 14:57.439
is missing.

14:59.066 --> 15:03.278
And unless we were robbed by strangers,

15:03.278 --> 15:05.656
and that is all that they took--

15:05.656 --> 15:06.865
Wait-- Oh, my God.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.785
Will knew about my relationship with Sam.

15:11.370 --> 15:12.621
If he found the gun...

15:16.416 --> 15:17.543
Yeah, I--

15:17.543 --> 15:20.921
I suppose he could have snuck out,

15:20.921 --> 15:23.674
but do we really think that--

15:23.674 --> 15:26.093
Did he know I was going to the party?

15:28.220 --> 15:29.054
Yeah.

15:30.055 --> 15:32.975
He could have been coming for me.
Found her instead.

15:33.642 --> 15:35.227
Maybe he knew she wanted to talk to me.

15:35.227 --> 15:38.188
Maybe Will is what she wanted
to talk to me about.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.149
No.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.735
What are we even saying?

15:46.029 --> 15:47.447
Is this even possible?

15:47.447 --> 15:50.200
Of course not,
but isn't that what all parents say?

15:50.200 --> 15:52.452
You saw that Klebold kid's mom on TV.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.163
Who knows? Who fucking knows?

15:56.582 --> 16:01.211
We have to talk to him.
We have to ask him point-blank.

16:04.298 --> 16:05.299
Yeah.

16:08.594 --> 16:10.762
But, tomorrow.

16:14.057 --> 16:15.434
I'm so fucking tired.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.954
You don't have to sleep on the couch.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.873
No, it's-- I don't mind.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.043
Neither do I.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.682
Sorry to interrupt,
but I come with some news.

18:19.308 --> 18:23.562
So, there is this street art group show
coming up.

18:23.562 --> 18:26.523
And I thought maybe, you know,
your stupid little spot signs

18:26.523 --> 18:30.527
could maybe work in context,
like your wordplay and-- Wow.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.531
I actually am interrupting.

18:35.199 --> 18:36.992
What is this new piece you're working on?

18:36.992 --> 18:38.076
William, it's--

18:38.577 --> 18:41.079
it's unlike any piece of art
I've ever seen you do.

18:42.164 --> 18:45.792
That's because it's not art. This is life.

18:48.754 --> 18:50.839
The girl in the park, she left me clues.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.549
She was onto something,

18:52.549 --> 18:56.386
a link between my former bandmate
and my family's business.

18:57.721 --> 19:02.559
And the answer to who shot her
is here somewhere.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.145
Or it will be soon.

19:05.646 --> 19:07.773
Just do whatever you want
with those signs.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.108
I was high when I made them.

19:10.108 --> 19:11.193
They're dumb as fuck.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.987
Yeah, well, "dumb as fuck"
is selling right now, honey.

19:13.987 --> 19:16.907
Well, if I am not here, you have a key.

19:18.659 --> 19:20.118
You can let yourself in.

19:22.204 --> 19:23.205
You going somewhere?

19:24.122 --> 19:26.458
I think I'm finally ready
to face my demons.

19:30.045 --> 19:32.798
Well, my demon.

19:33.674 --> 19:35.843
Okay.
I could never understand your riddles,

19:35.843 --> 19:38.637
but if this mystery
is inspiring you to create,

19:38.637 --> 19:40.389
well, then that's a good thing. Okay?

19:40.389 --> 19:41.598
I'll let myself out.

19:44.935 --> 19:46.478
- Hey.
- Yeah?

19:48.730 --> 19:52.067
You know that I wouldn't be...

19:54.403 --> 19:56.113
here if it weren't for you, right?

19:57.322 --> 19:58.323
I'd be dead.

19:59.074 --> 20:05.080
Suicide, a dirty needle, the plague.

20:06.206 --> 20:09.459
Good friends, clean needles,
and a shit ton of condoms.

20:10.294 --> 20:12.629
That is how any one of us
made it out alive. Okay?

20:17.050 --> 20:20.679
Those early conversations with your father
were difficult, but, you know,

20:21.805 --> 20:24.683
in the end, he was relieved
that there was someone looking after you.

20:25.851 --> 20:29.771
Well, you put up
with a lot of shit after that.

20:31.523 --> 20:34.443
Whatever they said in Artforum,

20:35.903 --> 20:37.404
you never thought I was a genius.

20:38.697 --> 20:40.115
I never thought you had to be.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.661
Geniuses die young,

20:45.162 --> 20:49.833
and I believe that you will make
a very fine old man.

20:54.880 --> 20:59.968
Will, you need to trust that you can
tell us anything,

21:00.636 --> 21:02.429
and we will still love you.

21:03.514 --> 21:08.227
It's our job as parents to protect you.

21:09.978 --> 21:11.188
Do you understand?

21:18.445 --> 21:20.155
I think you found my gun.

21:22.491 --> 21:28.539
I think you took it,
and I'm scared that you used it.

21:37.047 --> 21:38.090
I'm sorry.

21:41.552 --> 21:42.553
Will.

21:48.141 --> 21:49.810
I did find the gun.

21:51.311 --> 21:53.730
I took it, but you didn't notice.

21:56.275 --> 21:57.901
Then I sent that note to Mom.

21:59.111 --> 22:01.905
We moved out,
but you still didn't say anything.

22:02.865 --> 22:05.158
Only stupid stuff about how sometimes

22:05.158 --> 22:08.370
people are better parents
if they're not married.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.379
You wanted your dad to know that you knew.

22:21.341 --> 22:24.553
And I just wanted to feel
what it was like to pull the trigger.

22:30.475 --> 22:32.186
But I never thought I'd hit it.

22:37.941 --> 22:39.985
Hit what?

22:41.695 --> 22:42.613
The bird.

22:48.702 --> 22:50.829
And then what happened?

22:52.623 --> 22:56.376
I felt sick. S--

22:57.711 --> 22:59.838
I got scared and came home.

23:00.339 --> 23:01.673
You never went to the park.

23:04.426 --> 23:07.471
- Central Park. You didn't...
- No.

23:09.181 --> 23:10.432
I swear.

23:13.894 --> 23:15.854
Where is the gun now, honey?

23:17.940 --> 23:22.152
I threw it under our house.
Our house in Brooklyn.

23:23.403 --> 23:24.905
Okay, that's okay.

23:45.384 --> 23:47.177
Find what you were looking for?

23:48.428 --> 23:51.265
Hey. I thought you already left.

23:51.265 --> 23:54.476
I was just gonna grab some stuff
to go on a food run with.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.895
- I thought you guys might be hungry.
- I changed my mind.

23:59.398 --> 24:01.066
Think you should come with us.

24:04.486 --> 24:08.532
I thought you said there were gonna be
reporters and photographers and,

24:08.532 --> 24:10.951
I mean, I'm a wanted man.
It's not gonna be safe.

24:10.951 --> 24:13.954
Yeah, that's why I bought you this.

24:15.539 --> 24:16.540
Come on.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.461
It's a Bloomberg mask.

24:22.754 --> 24:23.881
It's funny, right?

24:25.174 --> 24:26.425
Come on, Charlie.

24:26.425 --> 24:28.844
Everyone's waiting. Come on.

24:31.263 --> 24:32.264
You sure?

24:32.264 --> 24:33.974
Yeah. Just get rid of it.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.241
I'm glad we did this together.

24:52.367 --> 24:53.368
Yeah.

24:54.161 --> 24:57.497
It's definitely a top-five moment
for sure.

24:57.497 --> 24:58.749
Yeah.

24:59.249 --> 25:02.419
College graduation, our wedding day,

25:02.920 --> 25:04.379
birth of my kids,

25:04.922 --> 25:09.510
then the time my ex and I disposed
of potential evidence

25:09.510 --> 25:12.095
in the shooting of his teenage mistress.

25:13.430 --> 25:18.393
If you think today
is some kind of victory, you're insane.

25:42.668 --> 25:47.214
Hey, my name is on the building,
and I would like to go upstairs, please.

25:47.214 --> 25:49.550
- Of course.
- Thanks.

25:58.308 --> 26:00.060
So the rumors are true.

26:01.144 --> 26:03.063
This is a surprise.

26:06.441 --> 26:07.568
Hello, Amory.

26:09.319 --> 26:12.781
You look exactly the same
as you did the last time I saw you.

26:12.781 --> 26:16.869
Pilates, protein,
and a certain doctor in Baden-Baden.

26:17.744 --> 26:18.829
Right.

26:19.454 --> 26:22.499
I meant you looked like
a two-faced, deceitful prick then,

26:22.499 --> 26:24.334
and you still do now.

26:25.752 --> 26:29.798
William, as tart-tongued
and delightful as ever.

26:31.258 --> 26:32.176
Would you like to go in?

26:40.309 --> 26:41.310
Have a seat.

26:42.227 --> 26:43.437
No, I'm not staying.

26:43.937 --> 26:45.397
That's too bad.

26:45.397 --> 26:50.402
I always enjoy my time with parasites
who squander their privilege,

26:50.402 --> 26:53.655
then use sarcasm
to cover their track marks.

26:53.655 --> 26:57.326
Yes,
if only I was born on your side of town,

26:58.160 --> 27:01.038
you and I could be fighting shoulder
to shoulder right now.

27:01.914 --> 27:05.417
To be clear,
that was sarcasm covering my track marks.

27:05.417 --> 27:08.003
What the fuck do you know about
where I come from?

27:09.463 --> 27:12.716
You've always been one pen stroke away
from the jackpot,

27:12.716 --> 27:15.010
which is why you're here, correct?

27:15.010 --> 27:16.929
Your father's business troubles?

27:17.429 --> 27:19.348
Come to claim what's yours,

27:19.348 --> 27:23.644
or at least to stop the demon brother
from claiming it.

27:24.228 --> 27:25.896
Yes, I know what you call me.

27:25.896 --> 27:29.816
And I know that you never got rid
of your voting rights.

27:29.816 --> 27:32.236
I don't give a shit about this business.

27:32.945 --> 27:35.364
I never have. I never will.

27:37.241 --> 27:41.828
I am here to solve a mystery.

27:42.621 --> 27:46.834
The girl that was shot in Central Park
loves my band.

27:47.751 --> 27:52.422
The Hamilton-Sweeney's are buying up
a bunch of burnt-out buildings

27:52.422 --> 27:54.007
out in the Bronx.

27:54.591 --> 27:56.343
Nicky Chaos knows the girl.

27:56.343 --> 28:00.222
And in some weird, fucked-up way,

28:00.222 --> 28:03.267
which I will soon figure out,

28:04.142 --> 28:07.771
Nicky, well, he also knows you.

28:10.524 --> 28:13.735
And I know you're too smart
to say something stupid right now.

28:14.361 --> 28:19.741
I am here because it feels so good

28:19.741 --> 28:23.161
to look you in your beady little eyes

28:23.161 --> 28:28.834
and let you know that I am finally going
to take you down, motherfucker.

28:30.419 --> 28:33.881
I know this girl's world,
I know your world,

28:34.715 --> 28:36.550
and I got the cops on speed-dial.

28:37.801 --> 28:40.137
I'm actually working
on my greatest piece yet.

28:40.137 --> 28:43.932
It's this giant, beautiful collaged canvas

28:43.932 --> 28:46.351
that tells this entire story.

28:46.351 --> 28:49.146
And right there, smack-dab in the middle...

28:51.940 --> 28:54.109
it'll be your mug shot.

28:58.614 --> 29:00.199
Consider yourself warned.

29:05.537 --> 29:07.956
Shall I convey your regards
to your father?

29:07.956 --> 29:10.918
I know you haven't seen fit
to keep in contact,

29:10.918 --> 29:13.670
but he doesn't have much time.

29:15.005 --> 29:16.131
So I've heard.

29:18.050 --> 29:19.635
But he's not dead yet.

29:21.011 --> 29:22.221
Who knows?

29:22.221 --> 29:24.848
Maybe once you're gone,
we can be a family again.

29:35.692 --> 29:38.237
- What now?
- Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gould,

29:38.237 --> 29:41.073
but we're getting a report
of something happening out front.

29:41.698 --> 29:44.409
- What's happening?
- Not sure exactly. A protest?

30:17.568 --> 30:19.444
Yes, thank you, everybody!

30:20.404 --> 30:22.281
Let me hear you make some noise.

30:25.284 --> 30:28.203
Thank you everyone for coming out today,

30:28.996 --> 30:32.082
but more importantly,
for giving a shit about this city.

30:34.543 --> 30:38.589
Now every day we see people struggling
in these streets...

30:38.589 --> 30:39.715
Yeah!

30:39.715 --> 30:42.634
...just trying to keep
their fucking families' businesses afloat.

30:43.302 --> 30:44.887
Get their rents paid.

30:45.888 --> 30:48.891
And then there are people
like these assholes.

30:50.058 --> 30:52.686
The Hamilton-Sweeney's,

30:52.686 --> 30:56.523
who are scooping up whole blocks
of this city for dirt cheap.

30:56.523 --> 30:59.484
And they're building luxury apartments
for people so rich,

30:59.985 --> 31:02.821
- they don't even fucking live there.
- That's right!

31:02.821 --> 31:05.407
All right? This is not okay!

31:05.407 --> 31:06.533
No!

31:12.623 --> 31:13.749
Fuck.

31:15.959 --> 31:17.669
Fucking detox.

31:18.170 --> 31:22.174
And the media,
the media wants to discredit our movement,

31:22.883 --> 31:26.011
but all they do is amplify our message.

31:27.262 --> 31:31.266
All right. Scientia potentia est.

31:31.266 --> 31:33.810
Knowledge is power.

31:33.810 --> 31:36.396
- Repeat after me. Knowledge...
- Knowledge...

31:36.396 --> 31:38.023
- Is power!
- Is power!

31:38.023 --> 31:39.483
Knowledge...

31:39.483 --> 31:41.193
- Is power!
- Is power!

31:41.193 --> 31:42.653
- Knowledge...
- Knowledge...

31:42.653 --> 31:44.321
- Is power!
- Is power!

31:44.321 --> 31:45.614
- Knowledge...
- Knowledge...

31:45.614 --> 31:47.199
- Is power!
- Is power!

31:49.618 --> 31:52.829
- All right! Hey, hey!
- Yo.

31:52.829 --> 31:58.794
I'm assuming this pitiful protest
is revenge for my firing you.

31:58.794 --> 31:59.878
...have to go!

31:59.878 --> 32:03.173
Detective Parsa and McFadden.
We're expected upstairs.

32:03.173 --> 32:05.717
<i>We're just bringing the fight
to your front door.</i>

32:05.717 --> 32:07.177
<i>Well, here's a heads-up.</i>

32:07.177 --> 32:10.764
<i>William Hamilton-Sweeney III
is about to exit that door.</i>

32:11.348 --> 32:12.933
- Ho, ho!
- Ho, ho!

32:13.684 --> 32:15.686
<i>He mentioned something
he's working on.</i>

32:16.603 --> 32:17.771
<i>A new canvas.</i>

32:19.189 --> 32:20.774
We're gonna need to reschedule.

32:20.774 --> 32:23.777
<i>He's hell-bent on proving
our connection</i>

32:23.777 --> 32:24.862
<i>to each other,</i>

32:25.863 --> 32:27.865
<i>and to that girl in the park.</i>

32:28.490 --> 32:31.034
I think you know what I'm asking you
to do.

32:31.034 --> 32:32.703
- Ho, ho!
- Ho, ho!

32:32.703 --> 32:34.788
- Hamilton-Sweeney has got to go!
- I don't kill people.

32:34.788 --> 32:36.373
Not what I heard.

32:36.373 --> 32:39.418
Ho, ho!
Hamilton-Sweeney has got to go!

32:39.418 --> 32:42.296
- Hey, hey! Ho, ho!
- Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

32:42.296 --> 32:44.464
Hamilton-Sweeney has got
to go!

32:44.464 --> 32:47.092
- Hey, hey! Ho, ho!
- Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

32:47.092 --> 32:49.219
Hamilton-Sweeney has got
to go!

32:49.219 --> 32:51.889
- Hey, hey! Ho, ho!
- Hello?

32:53.098 --> 32:54.183
I'm on it.

32:54.183 --> 32:56.476
- Hey, hey! Ho, ho!
- Go. Go follow!

32:56.476 --> 32:57.728
No, you keep going. Go--

32:58.353 --> 33:00.772
Hey, Nicky-- What the hell?

33:04.735 --> 33:06.320
Wait! We didn't get to case the building!

33:06.320 --> 33:09.031
We'll come back later! Sol, with me!
You, go to his studio!

33:11.742 --> 33:12.576
Fuck, man.

33:17.039 --> 33:18.749
- Our city!
- Where did he go?

33:18.749 --> 33:21.752
- Whose city?
- Our city!

33:21.752 --> 33:24.755
- Whose city? Who's city?
- Our city! Our city!

33:24.755 --> 33:26.632
Hey. Police!

33:26.632 --> 33:28.509
Hey! Stop!

33:28.509 --> 33:30.177
- Stop! Hey!
- Hey, hey.

33:30.177 --> 33:32.137
The cops are here to shut us down.

33:32.137 --> 33:37.392
No cops, free speech!

33:40.854 --> 33:42.147
Oh, fuck!

33:54.034 --> 33:55.369
Excuse me.

33:56.495 --> 33:58.747
- Jesus.
- William, remember me?

33:58.747 --> 34:00.707
You were handcuffed to my partner's desk.

34:00.707 --> 34:03.544
- You followed me here?
- Yeah, and I'm not the only one.

34:08.172 --> 34:09.757
Okay. You're on my side, right?

34:10.467 --> 34:12.052
I can trust you to protect and serve?

34:12.052 --> 34:13.719
Well, how do I know
you're the good guy here?

34:13.719 --> 34:15.848
Well, I am wearing pinstripes. So...

34:15.848 --> 34:20.101
Plus, if you could help me get out
of here, I can help you solve this thing.

34:20.101 --> 34:21.186
All right? I can help.

34:21.895 --> 34:22.896
Gentlemen.

34:23.397 --> 34:25.399
What are the chances?

34:26.567 --> 34:29.402
- So, how's it going?
- Not so good, Billy.

34:30.070 --> 34:32.239
- Not so good.
- That's too bad.

34:32.239 --> 34:33.489
This is our stop.

34:33.489 --> 34:34.699
All right. NYPD.

34:34.699 --> 34:37.077
I'm gonna need some names
and some answers right goddamn now.

34:42.248 --> 34:44.042
Hey, get the fuck off of me!

34:44.042 --> 34:45.668
Whatever you say, lady.

34:49.547 --> 34:51.925
Fuck. Hold the fucking door.

35:21.246 --> 35:24.958
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.
My friend is actually up this way.

35:24.958 --> 35:26.376
Sorry. Excuse me.

35:26.376 --> 35:27.878
- If I could just squeeze past.
- Yo, move.

35:27.878 --> 35:29.671
- I'm sorry.
- People, people move, move.

35:29.671 --> 35:30.964
Out of the way.

35:30.964 --> 35:32.049
What the fuck, bro? Move!

35:32.049 --> 35:33.008
Excuse me.

35:33.008 --> 35:35.093
- You wanna go? Let's go. All right, bro.
- Calm the fuck down.

35:37.304 --> 35:38.514
This is my father's watch.

35:42.893 --> 35:44.645
This is a Timex.

35:46.522 --> 35:48.524
Rich in sentimental value only.

35:48.524 --> 35:50.192
I'll take 16.99.

36:06.416 --> 36:08.377
Why would you hide any of these?

36:13.465 --> 36:15.467
Two, three, four, five...

36:18.929 --> 36:20.889
How many photos are there
on a roll of film?

36:21.974 --> 36:24.643
- Twenty-four.
- There are 21 here. Three are missing.

36:25.644 --> 36:28.814
Maybe three weren't good.
Sometimes they're blank or blurry.

36:28.814 --> 36:30.899
Somebody leaves the lens cap on
or whatever. We don't print--

36:30.899 --> 36:34.152
No. Sam did not take pictures
with the lens cap on, okay?

36:34.152 --> 36:36.405
- Just tell me where they are!
- Hey, calm down, kid.

36:36.905 --> 36:38.073
I don't have 'em.

36:38.073 --> 36:40.868
Some guy came by this morning,
paid me a hundred bucks to have a look.

36:40.868 --> 36:42.744
Must have slipped a few in his pocket.

36:46.540 --> 36:48.834
Print them for me. Now.

36:49.710 --> 36:50.794
We don't print singles.

36:51.753 --> 36:53.130
You got another 16.99?

36:55.591 --> 36:57.009
Fuck you, Doug!

37:11.023 --> 37:12.649
Now where you gonna go?

37:14.818 --> 37:16.778
Come on, you're too tired.

37:16.778 --> 37:18.864
Too fucked up to run.

37:20.574 --> 37:23.285
Besides, what would be the point?

37:25.162 --> 37:26.163
We're doing this?

37:28.248 --> 37:29.833
Well, you didn't shoot me
on a crowded subway.

37:29.833 --> 37:31.752
You're not gonna fucking shoot me here.

37:33.128 --> 37:36.715
Yeah, you're right.
We got too much history for that.

37:39.426 --> 37:40.677
I just wanna have a talk.

37:42.554 --> 37:43.639
Come for a walk with me.

37:45.098 --> 37:48.227
Talk. You walk with me?

37:50.437 --> 37:51.522
After you.

37:53.023 --> 37:55.526
Yeah. Actually,
I got some questions of my own, Nicky.

38:04.785 --> 38:08.580
William, it's me.

38:13.085 --> 38:14.628
Who are you?

38:15.587 --> 38:19.758
What gallery do you work with?

38:19.758 --> 38:21.218
Oh, no, no. Don't do that.

38:21.802 --> 38:22.886
Okay.

38:22.886 --> 38:26.640
Hello? Hello. Yes, I'd like
to report an intruder--

38:28.851 --> 38:29.852
Fuck!

39:35.083 --> 39:36.585
Excuse me. Hey.

39:36.585 --> 39:40.005
Did you know that gentrification
is displacing an entire,

39:40.005 --> 39:43.258
socioeconomic strata of city residents?

39:43.258 --> 39:44.885
Not interested. Thanks.

39:44.885 --> 39:46.970
You could at least
take a look at our literature.

39:46.970 --> 39:50.098
I just want to enjoy my slice in peace,
okay? Maybe someone else.

39:50.641 --> 39:52.434
I mean-- Yeah.
You could read it later, you know?

39:52.434 --> 39:53.977
<i>Scientia potentia est.</i>

39:53.977 --> 39:56.021
- Knowledge is power.
- I said fuck off.

39:58.941 --> 40:00.651
I'm so sorry.

40:01.777 --> 40:04.905
I just--
I get so passionate sometimes, you know?

40:04.905 --> 40:07.449
- Yeah.
- And I just-- I don't know.

40:07.449 --> 40:09.660
I'm sorry to bother you. That's--

40:26.426 --> 40:28.345
It's for a Deitch Projects group show.

40:28.345 --> 40:29.930
- Yeah.
- Kind of a post-punk,

40:29.930 --> 40:31.807
hyperrealist take on civic semiotics.

40:31.807 --> 40:32.975
Very cheeky.

40:32.975 --> 40:35.853
Jenny, hey.
I'm surprising William with dinner.

40:35.853 --> 40:37.062
Is that smoke?

40:38.272 --> 40:40.566
Holy shit! Call 911!

40:40.566 --> 40:42.651
Bruno's car is here. Where's Bruno?

40:43.235 --> 40:44.528
Oh, my God. What's happening?

40:44.528 --> 40:45.863
Fire.

40:46.905 --> 40:48.699
- Yeah. I'm at the corner of Meserole...
- What?

40:48.699 --> 40:49.783
...and Bushwick Place.

40:50.409 --> 40:51.702
I need to report a fire.

41:24.776 --> 41:26.111
Alone at last.

41:27.070 --> 41:28.238
This is more like it.

41:29.990 --> 41:32.576
Hey, if this really is the end
of the road for me,

41:33.452 --> 41:34.912
at least tell me the story.

41:37.748 --> 41:39.208
What happened to the girl, Nicky?

41:39.208 --> 41:40.542
You little f--

41:42.794 --> 41:44.630
You don't fucking talk about her.

41:45.589 --> 41:47.299
You don't know shit about Sam.

41:47.883 --> 41:50.135
Well, I kind of feel like I do.

41:51.386 --> 41:53.055
Read everything she wrote.

41:53.597 --> 41:55.891
She really ate your shit up, huh?

41:56.934 --> 41:59.478
But wouldn't follow you off the cliff.

42:01.688 --> 42:03.565
<i>No, she was a good girl.</i>

42:03.565 --> 42:06.318
<i>She had morals, limits.</i>

42:07.402 --> 42:08.529
<i>Did you find them?</i>

42:10.489 --> 42:12.199
Is that why she had to go?

42:19.665 --> 42:20.666
<i>No, Sol, Sol, Sol!</i>

42:21.792 --> 42:25.546
Yo! Sol, leave that shit.
Leave that shit. Come on.

42:25.546 --> 42:28.090
Yo, where's SG? Where's SG?

42:29.091 --> 42:31.969
I heard someone in the back screaming.
I think he's trapped.

42:31.969 --> 42:34.221
- Help!
- We have to go back. We have to help him.

42:34.221 --> 42:36.265
- No. We need to get out of here.
- Somebody help!

42:36.265 --> 42:37.975
You promised no one would get hurt!

42:38.809 --> 42:40.060
Fuck!

42:40.060 --> 42:41.895
Fuck that. We're gonna get hurt.

42:41.895 --> 42:43.605
- We have to go back!
- No.

42:43.605 --> 42:46.275
- We can't leave him!
- Sam!

42:46.275 --> 42:49.820
We have to go back! We have to go back!

42:49.820 --> 42:51.488
We have to save him!

42:52.447 --> 42:54.032
Nicky, we gotta go right now.

43:00.414 --> 43:01.707
Sam, come on. Let's go.

43:03.500 --> 43:04.751
<i>I'm sorry, Billy.</i>

43:06.670 --> 43:10.007
You're gonna have to die
without the answers you're craving.

43:14.428 --> 43:15.762
You're just gonna kill me?

43:17.890 --> 43:19.516
You're just gonna kill the leader
of your band?

43:20.267 --> 43:21.602
The leader?

43:21.602 --> 43:22.603
You quit.

43:23.812 --> 43:24.980
It's my band now.

43:24.980 --> 43:26.356
Your band?

43:26.356 --> 43:29.610
Hey, look. I'm not gonna kill you.

43:31.570 --> 43:32.487
I am.

43:33.822 --> 43:36.200
Hey.
You chill the fuck-- Get the fuck down.

43:36.783 --> 43:37.784
Here.

43:37.784 --> 43:39.203
It's gonna make too much noise.

43:39.703 --> 43:40.746
I saw you took that photo.

43:40.746 --> 43:42.873
- Give me the film.
- Okay. Just let me go.

43:42.873 --> 43:43.957
Just let me go.

43:47.169 --> 43:48.003
Sam!

43:51.590 --> 43:52.591
Sam, open the door!

43:55.844 --> 43:57.346
Sam, open the door!

43:59.806 --> 44:00.849
Give me the film, Sam.

44:02.059 --> 44:04.520
Sam, open the door!

44:11.735 --> 44:13.529
Okay. Just take the film though.

44:13.529 --> 44:17.074
Leave the camera.
Please! Please leave the camera!

44:17.074 --> 44:18.825
Please! It was my mother's!

45:14.840 --> 45:15.924
Damn.

45:18.051 --> 45:22.055
Once upon a time,
I fucking loved that guy.
