What if I go undercover
at this rehab place

06:42.532 --> 06:44.316

06:44.360 --> 06:48.756
ATF believes that Meyer
was about to sell those weapons

06:48.799 --> 06:50.801
to this man.

06:50.845 --> 06:54.152
Former U.S. Army General
Richard Collins.

06:54.196 --> 06:55.240
I know him.

06:55.284 --> 06:56.807
He's a right-wing
influencer.

06:56.851 --> 06:58.853
What was he gonna do
with so many weapons?

06:58.896 --> 07:00.985
Well, apparently,
the general was working

07:01.029 --> 07:04.032
with a very large militia group
in southern Arizona.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.729
SAM:
Sons of Our Fathers.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.905
Anti-immigrant. Big on
election conspiracies.

07:07.949 --> 07:09.559
If they heavily
arm this militia,

07:09.603 --> 07:11.474
that could be a really
dangerous powder keg.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.694
Sounds like we need to have
a conversation with him.

07:13.737 --> 07:16.479
I have already called
General Collins' office

07:21.310 --> 07:23.704
Why exactly am I not invited
to this party?

07:23.747 --> 07:25.836
Yeah, I thought the general
might be more comfortable

07:25.880 --> 07:28.099
with two former
military personnel.

07:28.143 --> 07:30.406
Want to make sure
the general is comfortable.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.755

07:31.799 --> 07:34.454

a highly decorated officer.

07:34.497 --> 07:37.065
This is how
I want to handle it.

07:38.936 --> 07:41.330
Okay.

07:41.373 --> 07:44.507
I'll work with Rountree,
see if we can find Meyer.

07:45.552 --> 07:47.771
Agent Hanna...

07:47.815 --> 07:50.426
we need to proceed with caution.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.168
General Collins
is incredibly powerful

07:53.211 --> 07:55.779
and politically well-connected.

07:55.823 --> 07:59.043
It can mean both of our careers
if we misstep on this.

07:59.087 --> 08:00.262
Understood.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.264
All right. We'll take my car.

FATIMA: Sir?Ah. Agent Namazi.

08:08.226 --> 08:11.578
We just received a call from the
office of Governor Harvey Case.

08:12.927 --> 08:15.538
The governor of Arizona
called me?

08:15.582 --> 08:17.932
Yes, sir. His aide said that
the governor urgently needed

08:17.975 --> 08:20.195
to speak to you
about the nature and scope

08:20.238 --> 08:22.327
of your inquiry
into General Collins.

08:22.371 --> 08:24.547
That didn't take long.No, it did not.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.462
All right, put him through.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.072
Let me have the room, please.

08:34.470 --> 08:37.429
Governor Case, how are you?

08:46.221 --> 08:49.529
So, what did the governor
have to say?

08:49.572 --> 08:51.356
We're still
interviewing Collins.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.880
We can make it
if there's no traffic.

08:52.923 --> 08:56.492
And?He wants us to proceed
with extreme sensitivity.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.625
Oh, he's also worried
about the general's comfort.

08:58.668 --> 09:01.541
It seems that the general
has, in private,

09:01.584 --> 09:04.413
announced his intention
to run for Senate.

09:05.762 --> 09:08.809
Oh, so now we're concerned
about his political aspirations.

09:08.852 --> 09:11.551
Yes.Really?

09:11.594 --> 09:12.639
So maybe I should go get

09:12.682 --> 09:14.379
my "Make Arizona
Great Again" hat, huh?

09:14.423 --> 09:17.557
If he is not involved
in buying guns from Meyer,

09:17.600 --> 09:21.256
the last thing we want to do is
to affect the electoral process.

09:21.299 --> 09:23.563
A process I still
believe in very strongly.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.913
But maybe I'm just
old-fashioned that way.

09:25.956 --> 09:29.612
I'm fair and I'm discreet,
so I'm not worried about that.

09:29.656 --> 09:30.961
But what does concern me

09:31.005 --> 09:33.616
is Lukas Meyer has killed
seven federal agents,

09:33.660 --> 09:34.878
and he might escape
while we take time

09:34.922 --> 09:36.097
tiptoeing around this guy.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.055
I want Meyer as much as you do.

09:38.099 --> 09:40.014
But let's be clear.

09:40.057 --> 09:42.582
How we proceed
with this investigation

09:42.625 --> 09:44.627
is up to my discretion.

09:45.672 --> 09:48.457
Oh, that's good to know,
Admiral.

09:53.027 --> 09:54.332
How about a, uh, lonely,

09:54.376 --> 09:56.117
emotionally-neglected
Culver City housewife

09:56.160 --> 09:57.727
who has an oxy addiction
but steps up to heroin

09:57.771 --> 09:59.511
because of her pool boy
drug connection?

09:59.555 --> 10:02.166
How cute is this pool boy?What does that have
to do with anything?

10:02.210 --> 10:04.168
Just trying to see what
your vision of the character is.

10:04.212 --> 10:05.779
Wait a minute, what's happening?
You paint your nails

10:05.822 --> 10:07.215
just so you
can scuff them?

10:07.258 --> 10:08.477
Yeah.Talk about a commitment
to character.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.087
Okay, so did they-did they
have sex?

10:10.131 --> 10:12.612
Did she have sex with who?The pool boy
and-and the housewife.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.135
Where are you going
with this?

10:14.178 --> 10:15.658
Oh. I see where you're going
with this.

10:15.702 --> 10:18.139
Yes, yes, they had sex,
lots of sex, because...

10:18.182 --> 10:20.881
he was handsome
and cute and blond.

10:20.924 --> 10:23.144
Also struggling with an
addiction of his own,

10:23.187 --> 10:25.886
which was meaningless sex with
lonely Culver City housewives.

10:25.929 --> 10:29.019
Ah. So they're having an affair.Yes, affair, see?

10:29.063 --> 10:30.934
A torrid, torrid
love affair.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.457
But then he gets clean.

10:32.501 --> 10:35.460
He kicks his... his giant,
enormous sex addiction.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.680
Which helps her kick
her oxy problem.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.290
And then they move
to Carpenteria,

10:39.334 --> 10:40.901
and they open up
a CBD store.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.554
Fairy-tale ending.I mean, yeah,

10:42.598 --> 10:44.078
like a Quentin
Tarantino movie.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.993
Add a couple
of La La Landmusical numbers,

10:46.036 --> 10:47.777
and you got yourself
a Netflix movie.

10:47.821 --> 10:50.084
Anyway, back to our
regularly-scheduled program.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.347
I did find out
that Mia Hahn attended

10:52.390 --> 10:54.218
the Berlin University
of Technical

10:54.262 --> 10:56.568
for two years.What did she study?

10:56.612 --> 10:59.528
Abstract algebra
and number theory?

10:59.571 --> 11:01.051
Wow. That's not
really gonna jibe

11:01.095 --> 11:02.531
with our lonely
Culver City housewife

11:02.574 --> 11:05.142
and our super
sexy pool boy.

11:05.186 --> 11:08.015
Anyways, uh, so,
your name is Megan Sinclair.

11:08.058 --> 11:11.018
Here is your driver's license,
credit cards, bank card.

11:11.061 --> 11:13.673
You've been convicted
of obtaining

11:13.716 --> 11:15.370
multiple prescriptions
of oxycodone

11:15.413 --> 11:18.112
from different physicians,
and a DUI.

11:18.155 --> 11:19.548
Thank you.Okay.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.115
I'll see you at the rehab.Yeah.

11:21.158 --> 11:23.117
Oh, and my character name,
by the way, is Layla.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.945
I was gonna ask.
See you there, Layla.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.424
Bye, Meg.

11:28.818 --> 11:32.169
Uh, before you go,
how are you, um...

11:32.213 --> 11:35.999
how you feeling
about Kessler?

11:36.043 --> 11:37.305
Not great.

11:37.348 --> 11:39.742
But at least this time
we found him.

11:39.786 --> 11:42.310
Yeah, instead
of the other way around.

11:42.353 --> 11:44.573
So I'm predator, not prey.Yeah, you are.

11:44.616 --> 11:46.053
My little predator.

11:46.096 --> 11:47.881
My little...

11:47.924 --> 11:50.144
cute, cuddly velociraptor.

11:50.187 --> 11:51.623
Deeks.What?

11:51.667 --> 11:53.756
We cannot let him
make us do something stupid.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.149
You know that, right?

11:55.192 --> 11:56.672
Baby, life is...

11:56.716 --> 11:59.675
far too good to...

11:59.719 --> 12:02.112
to let him screw it up.

12:04.941 --> 12:06.595
Okay.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.122
Thank you.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.689
Hollace,

12:13.733 --> 12:15.473
how are you?I am good.

12:15.517 --> 12:17.824
How are you,
General?Oh, never better.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.564
Miriam, can I get
a glass of water?

12:19.608 --> 12:23.481
Uh, this is retired
Special Warfare Operator,

12:23.525 --> 12:25.092
Senior Chief
Sam Hanna.

12:25.135 --> 12:26.963
NCIS Agent Sam Hanna.

12:27.007 --> 12:28.138
Well, I won't hold that
against you.

12:28.182 --> 12:30.227
Pleasure to meet you.
Please, sit.

12:30.271 --> 12:31.620
Thank you.

12:31.663 --> 12:32.926
[sighs]:Ah...

12:32.969 --> 12:35.276
Oh, thank you.Yes, sir.

12:37.582 --> 12:38.540
[door closes]

12:38.583 --> 12:40.020
So, this is about, um,

12:40.063 --> 12:41.369
Lukas Meyer?

12:41.412 --> 12:45.460
We believe that he has
killed seven ATF agents.

12:45.503 --> 12:47.505
Oh, no.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.594
Oh, that's... God,
that's terrible.

12:49.638 --> 12:50.944
Are you sure it's him?

12:50.987 --> 12:51.901
Yes.

12:52.946 --> 12:54.686
What can I do?

12:54.730 --> 12:57.820
Well, we understand that you
might have been in the process

12:57.864 --> 12:59.779
of buying weapons
from him.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.345
Oh, yes, I was.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.957
Well, those weapons came into
the United States illegally.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.089
That's why the ATF
was tracking him.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.091
[chuckles]:
Well, it's a damn good thing

13:08.135 --> 13:09.527
I didn't buy 'em, then,
'cause that...

13:09.571 --> 13:10.920
that would have been
a hell of a mess.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.269
It sure would have.

13:12.313 --> 13:13.793
You'd have been stepping in it
on that one, now.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.707
The ATF believes
that the sale was

13:15.751 --> 13:18.362
for over 200 AK-47s.

13:18.406 --> 13:20.321
What are you gonna do
with that many guns?

13:20.364 --> 13:22.497
Well, I've been supporting
a group of patriots

13:22.540 --> 13:25.326
for a few years now, and as...
as a token of appreciation,

13:25.369 --> 13:27.241
I was gonna give the guns
to them.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.243
They've been patrolling
our southern borders

13:29.286 --> 13:32.637
and voluntarily giving their
time to good patriotic causes.

13:32.681 --> 13:33.987
They're very
good men.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.250
That's a lot of guns.

13:36.293 --> 13:39.427
"A well-regulated Militia,
being necessary to the security

13:39.470 --> 13:41.429
"of a free State,
the right of the people

13:41.472 --> 13:43.997
to keep and bear Arms
shall not be infringed."

13:44.040 --> 13:45.650
I fully understand
the Second Amendment.

13:45.694 --> 13:47.000
I'm literally
supporting

13:47.043 --> 13:48.697
a militia.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.873
This isn't about hunting
or self-defense.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.614
It's the Second Amendment
verbatim.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.137
It's as American as...

13:54.181 --> 13:56.139
Free and fair elections.

13:57.184 --> 13:59.490
[chuckles]

13:59.534 --> 14:01.101
Exactly.

14:01.144 --> 14:02.711
Well...

14:02.754 --> 14:05.714
just please let us know if Meyer
makes contact, all right?

14:05.757 --> 14:06.976
Of course.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.065
Anything I can do,
I'm here to help, Hollace.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.720
Thank you for
your time.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.853
Agent Hanna.Hmm?

14:13.896 --> 14:15.637
I have an open-door policy.

14:20.424 --> 14:22.862
[door opens]KILBRIDE:
I need you to back off and stick

14:22.905 --> 14:24.689
to the point.Oh, come on.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.517
There's no way this guy didn't
know the sale was illegal.

14:26.561 --> 14:29.042
And we will get nowhere with
that if Collins lawyers up.

14:29.085 --> 14:30.913
The point is to get
Meyer, quickly.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.436
Collins is giving guns
to fanatics

14:32.480 --> 14:33.916
because he's running
for Senate.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.222
This is his crazy version

14:35.265 --> 14:36.788
of shaking hands
and kissing babies.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.790
And all of that is
irrelevant to this case.

14:38.834 --> 14:39.922
No, it's not.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.097
The acts of this militia

14:41.141 --> 14:42.359
are dangerous, illegal

14:42.403 --> 14:44.144
and may be facilitated
by this arms sale.

14:44.187 --> 14:47.234
I understand
your point of view, Agent.

14:47.277 --> 14:49.584
Regardless, this case
will be handled

14:49.627 --> 14:51.934
in a manner that I see fit.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.067
You made that clear.
But the first job of an agent

14:54.110 --> 14:55.851
is to follow the facts
wherever they may go.Do not

14:55.895 --> 14:57.635
tell me what the job
of an agent is.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.681
My question is
are you willing to do that?

15:21.311 --> 15:23.183
This is just a
consent form.

15:23.226 --> 15:26.316
Look it over, and if
you're good, just sign it.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.884
Okay.Now, take your time.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.234
And then we'll show you
your room, give you a tour.

15:31.278 --> 15:32.975
There's no pressure at all.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.020
Okay.Mm-hmm.

15:34.063 --> 15:36.761
Thank you.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.372
I'm in.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.026
Just getting unpacked.

15:40.069 --> 15:41.766
You spot Mia yet?

15:41.810 --> 15:43.986
Yeah. She's, uh,
been running off to the bathroom

15:44.030 --> 15:46.119
a couple times
with another woman.

15:46.162 --> 15:48.382
My guess is drinking or drugs.

15:48.425 --> 15:49.949
Addictions are brutal.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.951
Yeah. I had a friend

15:51.994 --> 15:54.997
I wish I could have gotten
into a place like this.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.913
Just didn't fully understand
what I was dealing with.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.133
I'm-I'm sorry to hear that.
That's really tough.

16:00.176 --> 16:04.702
Been working on
not blaming myself for a while.

16:04.746 --> 16:06.400
[quietly]: Now.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.360
Mia's headed
to the bathroom again.

16:10.404 --> 16:12.493
I'll follow her
and see what she's up to.

16:12.536 --> 16:13.320
Copy that.

16:13.363 --> 16:14.712
Are you done?

16:14.756 --> 16:16.018
Yeah.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.019
Great.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.629
That's for you.Thanks.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.588
I'll take you
to your room.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.851
Guess we're doing this.Mm-hmm.

16:23.939 --> 16:26.637
You find anything?We've got
a pretty clear picture

16:26.681 --> 16:28.378
of Meyer and his team's
movements this past week.

16:28.422 --> 16:30.859
Yeah, mostly hotels and clubs,
but they've made several stops

16:30.902 --> 16:33.688
to this area of
the garment district downtown.

16:33.731 --> 16:35.472
Lots of big, empty
buildings. Perfect place

16:35.516 --> 16:36.865
to store the weapons.Mm-hmm.

16:36.908 --> 16:38.867
Okay.What?

16:38.910 --> 16:40.042
We crashed.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.349
I'm gonna have to reboot
the system.

16:42.392 --> 16:43.872
[computer buzzes]

16:43.915 --> 16:45.743
[thumping, whirring down]

16:45.787 --> 16:47.876
All right, Kilbride
won't be able to listen.

16:47.919 --> 16:49.878
We got 30 seconds before
the system reboots.

16:49.921 --> 16:52.272
All right, what did you find?All right, so you
wanted to know

16:52.315 --> 16:53.925
exactly how Kilbride
knew Collins.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.231
I found this.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.668
They served on several
DoD advisory committees

16:57.712 --> 17:00.323
over the past 15 years.Well, with their ranking,
that makes sense.

17:00.367 --> 17:02.151
Yeah.
Then I found this.

17:02.195 --> 17:03.805
That's from 2006.

17:03.848 --> 17:05.198
That's from '08.

17:05.241 --> 17:06.590
He didn't just
know him,

17:06.634 --> 17:08.201
they're friends.

17:08.244 --> 17:11.421
Which means Kilbride
could be trying to protect him.

17:11.465 --> 17:13.467
[thumping, whirring up]

17:24.652 --> 17:26.436
WOMAN:
Look, I told everyone

17:26.480 --> 17:28.873
that my hip hurt.
And the oxy was helping me

17:28.917 --> 17:30.919
till I could get my operation.

17:30.962 --> 17:33.182
But it wasn't true?

17:33.226 --> 17:35.228
No.

17:35.271 --> 17:38.100
My mom and my dad
were both alcoholics.

17:38.144 --> 17:40.842
I keep asking myself,
was I born an addict,

17:40.885 --> 17:43.671
or did all of that
make me an addict?

17:43.714 --> 17:45.368
I don't know.

17:45.412 --> 17:47.370
I-I'm done.

17:47.414 --> 17:49.372
Okay.

17:49.416 --> 17:52.854
Uh, Megan, do
you feel like

17:52.897 --> 17:54.856
introducing yourself
to the group?

17:54.899 --> 17:56.640
Um, sure.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.773
I'm... Megan.

17:58.816 --> 18:01.993
I got a DUI,
so I kind of have to be here.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.865
And, um,

18:03.908 --> 18:05.432
I also like oxy.

18:05.475 --> 18:07.390
Laura didn't say
she likedit.

18:08.435 --> 18:12.047
My bad. Sorry, I thought
this was a safe space to share.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.788
Anything else?

18:13.831 --> 18:16.399
Oh, no. Clearly,
I've said too much already.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.272
Okay.

18:20.316 --> 18:21.622
Mia,

18:21.665 --> 18:25.800
did anything that Laura said
resonate with you?

18:26.844 --> 18:29.151
That question she asks--

18:29.195 --> 18:31.632
is addiction inherent in me

18:31.675 --> 18:34.983
or is it from the pain
that life has brought me--

18:35.026 --> 18:37.986
I think about that
all the time.

18:38.029 --> 18:39.248
Of course.

18:40.815 --> 18:43.426
Can you talk about your pain?

18:44.862 --> 18:46.386
[sniffles]

18:46.429 --> 18:49.563
Pain would be easy
to deal with if it was clear,

18:49.606 --> 18:51.695
straight.

18:51.739 --> 18:55.395
But you tie it with love,
and then it's all confused.

18:55.438 --> 18:57.832
You mean like abuse
from a loved one?

18:57.875 --> 19:01.052
Is that where the bruise
on your cheek is from?

19:03.359 --> 19:06.710
If I say yes,
you have to report it, so...

19:06.754 --> 19:09.713
no, I fell.

19:11.062 --> 19:13.456
You don't want to betray him?

19:13.500 --> 19:15.545
Betray...
[sniffles]

19:15.589 --> 19:18.069
Betrayal starts with yourself.

19:18.113 --> 19:20.550
You just have to look
in the mirror.

19:20.594 --> 19:23.292
You know,
I can't talk about this now.

19:23.336 --> 19:25.381
Okay.

19:25.425 --> 19:27.078
When you're ready.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.822
Yeah, let's, uh... it's
getting to be a mess back here.

19:31.866 --> 19:33.694
Let's pull all the long guns,
check 'em and clean 'em.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.043
Yeah, for sure,
all right.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.699
[quietly]:
There's no mics back here.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.527
Okay. What's, uh,
what's going on?

19:40.570 --> 19:42.572
We just found out that Kilbride

19:42.616 --> 19:45.227
is personal friends
with General Collins.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.098
Wait, so you think that
Kilbride's protecting him?

19:47.142 --> 19:48.230
I don't know.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.753
But he won't let us
go after him.

19:50.798 --> 19:53.061
All right,
so what do you want me to do?

19:53.104 --> 19:55.063
Tail Collins.
He knows we're looking at him.

19:55.106 --> 19:56.760
Let's see what he does
under pressure.

19:56.804 --> 19:59.328
Got it. Send me his info.All right.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.203
What'd you find?

20:04.246 --> 20:06.553
So, I've been looking at
all the buildings in this area

20:06.596 --> 20:09.033
of the garment district where
Meyer and his team keep going,

20:09.077 --> 20:11.210
and I found out
that this building

20:11.253 --> 20:14.256
is owned by a corporation
in Cologne, Germany.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.562
And Meyer is German.

20:15.605 --> 20:17.912
Anything to tie Meyer
to the corporation?

20:17.955 --> 20:19.261
I'm still drilling down
on that,

20:19.305 --> 20:21.263
but this building's
over 4,000 square feet,

20:21.307 --> 20:23.004
and there haven't been
any tenants in it

20:23.047 --> 20:24.310
in over a year.

20:24.353 --> 20:25.572
Let's get a search warrant.

20:25.615 --> 20:26.834
All right, on it.

20:26.877 --> 20:29.837
Hey. Push the judge.
We need this fast.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.672
Collins is coming to a stop.
He's meeting somebody.

20:45.809 --> 20:48.203
Just sent you a photo.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.335
Got it.

20:49.378 --> 20:51.075
That's Devon Walker.
He's the leader

20:51.119 --> 20:53.469
of the militia group
Sons of Our Fathers.

20:53.513 --> 20:55.863
Hmm. Collins may be
meeting them to tell them

20:55.906 --> 20:57.604
he's not getting any guns.

20:59.606 --> 21:02.783
Well, if that's the case, he
doesn't look very disappointed.

21:02.826 --> 21:05.089
Do we think that Collins
is still trying to acquire

21:05.133 --> 21:07.178
these weapons
even with this heat on Meyer?

21:07.222 --> 21:08.484
Depends on how
stupid he is.

21:08.528 --> 21:09.920
Or ambitious.

21:09.964 --> 21:12.140
This man wants
to be senator.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.621
Let's get a warrant
to put a tap on Collins' phone.

21:14.664 --> 21:16.057
I'll submit it.

21:29.766 --> 21:31.551
Hey.

21:33.422 --> 21:35.598
You think I
don't see that?

21:35.642 --> 21:38.122
Fine, you see it.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.341
I want it.

21:39.385 --> 21:40.821
You want a sip?

21:40.864 --> 21:42.562
I'm an addict.

21:42.605 --> 21:43.780
I want the whole bottle.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.956
[laughs]
That's not happening.

21:46.000 --> 21:46.957
[grunts]

21:48.002 --> 21:50.352
You gonna call for help?

21:50.396 --> 21:52.833
You know, they kick you out if
they catch you drinking in here.

21:52.876 --> 21:54.313
No refunds.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.053
Get off me.

21:56.097 --> 21:58.012
Let go of the bottle.

21:58.055 --> 21:59.535
[grunts]

22:00.536 --> 22:01.972
[panting]

22:05.324 --> 22:08.283
All right, I know
you got oxy, too.I don't.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.198
Your little friend you like
to run to the bathroom with--

22:10.241 --> 22:13.593
she ratted you out.I don't have oxy.

22:14.724 --> 22:16.465
I don't have any.Oh, yeah?

22:16.509 --> 22:18.554
[grunts]
I'm telling the truth.

22:21.209 --> 22:23.080
It's not gonna end well
unless you walk away.

22:23.124 --> 22:24.995
Really?

22:25.039 --> 22:27.128
You think you're that
much of a badass?

22:28.651 --> 22:31.654
[grunting]Get off...

22:42.752 --> 22:44.406
[groans, pants]

22:47.583 --> 22:49.803
This place sucks.

22:59.552 --> 23:02.685
You okay?

23:02.729 --> 23:04.078
I am now.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.427
Okay.Thank you.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.429
Yeah.

23:10.476 --> 23:13.392
MIA:
I was studying mathematics.
I loved it.

23:13.435 --> 23:16.438
But I was offered
a job to model,

23:16.482 --> 23:17.918
and then another.

23:17.961 --> 23:20.311
Gave me a bunch of money.

23:20.355 --> 23:22.836
And then I met Lukas.

23:22.879 --> 23:25.491
Clubs, drinking, ecstasy.

23:25.534 --> 23:27.667
It was fun at first.

23:30.757 --> 23:32.802
Is he the one who hit you?

23:32.846 --> 23:34.761
He doesn't just hit me.

23:34.804 --> 23:37.285
He controls
everything I do.

23:37.328 --> 23:40.114
Tells me what to wear,
when to sleep,

23:40.157 --> 23:42.072
what to eat,
how much to eat.

23:42.116 --> 23:45.467
When I told him I wanted
to go back to modeling,

23:45.511 --> 23:48.557
there was a swimwear shoot
in the Caribbean.Yeah.

23:48.601 --> 23:52.648
That night he
heated up a knife

23:52.692 --> 23:54.607
over the stove.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.831
He held me down
and pressed it into my side.

24:01.875 --> 24:05.531
[crying]
He said, "You're not going to be

24:05.574 --> 24:07.576
a swimwear model anymore."

24:12.625 --> 24:14.235
You have to get away
from him.

24:14.278 --> 24:17.499
Lukas is a criminal.
He's killed people.

24:17.543 --> 24:21.634
And because of my
mathematic studies, he...

24:21.677 --> 24:23.287
he had me handling
his books,

24:23.331 --> 24:25.638
moving his money
to safe accounts.

24:25.681 --> 24:28.858
He-he knows I know
where the bodies are buried.

24:28.902 --> 24:31.078
He's never
going to let me walk away.

24:31.121 --> 24:33.210
Then you have to go
to the police.

24:33.254 --> 24:36.692
Believe me, I thought about it.

24:36.736 --> 24:40.261
Lukas said if I ever
betrayed him...

24:40.304 --> 24:42.568
He knew my parents'
address in Munich.

24:42.611 --> 24:44.787
He'd kill them or...

24:44.831 --> 24:46.746
or have them killed.

24:50.663 --> 24:52.491
I am so sorry.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.810
NCIS. We have a search warrant.

25:07.854 --> 25:09.725
Hit it.

25:09.769 --> 25:11.597
Go, go, go!

25:15.905 --> 25:18.255
Clear.There's nothing here.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.696
Meyer threatened her family.
She's never gonna

25:23.739 --> 25:26.263
flip on this guy.DEEKS: Rountree and Callen

25:26.307 --> 25:27.830
searched the warehouse.
It was empty.

25:27.874 --> 25:29.702
Great. So we got nothing.

25:29.745 --> 25:31.617
And the longer this takes,
the more time Meyer has

25:31.660 --> 25:32.748
to get out of the country.

25:32.792 --> 25:36.752
Okay, so we
got to force the issue.

25:36.796 --> 25:38.449
What are you thinking?

25:38.493 --> 25:40.016
[sighs]

25:40.060 --> 25:42.018
I'm thinking I have to
solve her problem.

25:42.062 --> 25:44.064
Wow, even through the phone
I can hear

25:44.107 --> 25:46.675
your velociraptor mind
just scheming away.

25:46.719 --> 25:49.199
Hey, babe, I got to go.Okay,

25:49.243 --> 25:50.766
be safe.

25:54.117 --> 25:55.858
Hey, it's me.Close the door.

25:58.121 --> 25:59.296
Only two more left.

25:59.340 --> 26:00.515
I can't go through
withdrawals right now.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.603
I just don't have it in me.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.083
I have an idea.
I can help you.

26:03.126 --> 26:04.519
No, I just have to
get out of here.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.608
I have a friend with a
similar situation to yours.

26:06.652 --> 26:09.263
Her boyfriend was abusive,
he was violent, he was awful.

26:09.306 --> 26:11.395
What did your friend do?

26:11.439 --> 26:13.746
Lukas is a criminal, right?

26:13.789 --> 26:15.095
Yeah.

26:15.138 --> 26:17.271
So maybe a lot of people
want to see him dead.

26:19.316 --> 26:23.451
Let's say they find him
in his home shot one morning.

26:23.494 --> 26:25.627
Pretty hard to figure out
who did it, right?

26:25.671 --> 26:28.456
Who would shoot him?

26:33.156 --> 26:35.419
You?

26:35.463 --> 26:36.856
You'd kill him for me?

26:39.598 --> 26:42.383
I helped my friend
solve her problem.

26:44.211 --> 26:46.039
I can do it again.

26:49.042 --> 26:52.001
It's a lot easier
than you think.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.670
Agent Hanna.

27:08.714 --> 27:10.280
May I have a word with you?

27:16.504 --> 27:17.679
You want
to explain to me

27:17.723 --> 27:20.334
why you ordered a tap
on Collins' phone

27:20.377 --> 27:21.509
without my knowledge?

27:25.034 --> 27:27.820
I had him followed...Also without my knowledge.

27:27.863 --> 27:31.519
And he had another meeting
with the leader

27:31.562 --> 27:33.303
of the Sons of Our Fathers.

27:33.347 --> 27:35.828
I think he might still be trying
to acquire those weapons.

27:35.871 --> 27:37.699
That is why you
ordered the tap.

27:37.743 --> 27:41.137
And so I ask again:
why was it without my knowledge?

27:41.181 --> 27:42.269
Because I know about your
personal relationship

27:42.312 --> 27:44.271
with Collins.

27:44.314 --> 27:46.926
And I think you may be too close
to the guy to investigate.

27:46.969 --> 27:48.797
I cancelled the warrant
for the tap.

27:48.841 --> 27:51.408
Why?

27:51.452 --> 27:54.020
As I said before,

27:54.063 --> 27:56.370
Collins is well-connected.

27:56.413 --> 27:58.894
Someone in the courts
might warn him.

27:58.938 --> 28:01.114
If he shuts down the deal,

28:01.157 --> 28:03.203
then we don't recover
the weapons.

28:03.246 --> 28:06.032
Nor do we get Meyer
and his associates.

28:06.075 --> 28:08.469
Right.

28:08.512 --> 28:10.123
It all makes perfect sense.

28:10.166 --> 28:13.604
Anything else
you're not telling me?

28:15.171 --> 28:18.044
Callen and Rountree discovered
that the German corporation

28:18.087 --> 28:20.263
that owns the building downtown

28:20.307 --> 28:24.093
is a subsidiary
of Meyer's other corporation.

28:24.137 --> 28:26.400
But he does own it.

28:26.443 --> 28:28.663
Okay.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.579
Sit on that building.
Watch it.

28:31.622 --> 28:33.668
The weapons will be going there.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.844
Understood.

28:35.888 --> 28:39.369
That is all.

28:50.163 --> 28:53.035
Were you really serious about
what you said earlier?

28:53.079 --> 28:54.733
Wouldn't say it if
I didn't mean it.

28:57.474 --> 29:00.129
But understand that I have
no interest in getting caught.

29:01.522 --> 29:04.307
How much would it cost me?

29:04.351 --> 29:05.787
I wouldn't do it for the money.

29:05.831 --> 29:08.442
I told you I had access
to my boyfriend's accounts,

29:08.485 --> 29:09.791
then you offer to do this.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.924
Megan, we're both
junkies in rehab.

29:11.967 --> 29:14.013
Look, believe what you want,
but it's not about the money

29:14.056 --> 29:15.841
for me, okay?
Like I said, I had a friend

29:15.884 --> 29:17.581
who went through this
for a long time.

29:17.625 --> 29:18.626
A friend?

29:24.675 --> 29:28.070
Dated a guy for two years.

29:28.114 --> 29:30.029
Things got bad.
Really bad.

29:30.072 --> 29:32.771
I refused to have sex
with him.

29:34.163 --> 29:35.425
He got a gun.

29:35.469 --> 29:37.863
He put it to my head.

29:39.342 --> 29:40.996
He raped me.

29:42.693 --> 29:45.261
And told me he owned me.

29:48.090 --> 29:51.441
I am never letting that
happen again.

29:55.271 --> 29:56.533
So, how do we do this?

30:03.149 --> 30:04.324
You got everything you need
in your purse?

30:04.367 --> 30:05.368
Your wallet and everything?

30:05.412 --> 30:07.588
Everything in here.Yeah?

30:07.631 --> 30:08.894
Then let's get out of here.

30:08.937 --> 30:11.287
Now? Are you joking?

30:11.331 --> 30:13.942
Yeah, let's get out of this
craphole, let's go.Are you joking?

30:13.986 --> 30:15.596
[laughing][yells]

30:18.033 --> 30:19.426
What is it?

30:19.469 --> 30:21.123
I need you to stake out
Meyer's warehouse.

30:21.167 --> 30:23.343
Okay.

30:23.386 --> 30:25.954
Kilbride killed the tap
on Collins' phone.

30:25.998 --> 30:27.303
Really?Yeah.

30:27.347 --> 30:30.306
He won't let us tap
Collins' phone,

30:30.350 --> 30:31.525
but we can tap the other half

30:31.568 --> 30:33.092
of the conversation,
Devon Walker.

30:33.135 --> 30:34.876
Oh, leader
of the militia group.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.357
Yeah. And if Walker and Collins
happen to have a conversation...

30:37.400 --> 30:38.837
Yeah, we get what we need.

30:38.880 --> 30:41.230
But don't go through
Ops, all right?

30:41.274 --> 30:42.753
Submit for the warrant
direct to the judge,

30:42.797 --> 30:44.190
then go to the warehouse.

30:44.233 --> 30:45.278
All right, got it.

30:45.321 --> 30:46.845
Keep me posted.

30:52.024 --> 30:55.984
Mm! Brain freeze. Oh!

30:56.028 --> 30:59.509
Sugar is so good.Mmm. Yeah, it is.

30:59.553 --> 31:02.338
Gonna need something
else really soon.

31:04.427 --> 31:07.343
What are you doing?Texting my connection.

31:10.956 --> 31:12.392
Do you think if Lukas
was out of the picture

31:12.435 --> 31:13.784
you'd be able to get clean?

31:17.266 --> 31:19.181
It's crazy.

31:19.225 --> 31:21.053
Until you started talking
about killing him,

31:21.096 --> 31:24.186
I couldn't even see two minutes
past getting high.

31:26.145 --> 31:27.146
But yeah.

31:27.189 --> 31:29.931
If he were gone
I think I could.

31:31.454 --> 31:33.195
I hope you do.

31:36.416 --> 31:37.808
You're really doing this?

31:41.029 --> 31:42.596
Yes.

31:43.814 --> 31:46.034
But I got to do it safely.
I got to check him out.

31:46.078 --> 31:47.253
See how he moves,

31:47.296 --> 31:49.168
who he's with.

31:49.211 --> 31:50.299
You're going to need a gun.

31:50.343 --> 31:52.171
I can get that.

31:52.214 --> 31:54.390
Hmm. I've been with Lukas
long enough to know

31:54.434 --> 31:58.438
not just any gun.
You need it untraceable.

31:58.481 --> 31:59.743
That's money.

31:59.787 --> 32:02.355
No big deal. I got a guy
who can get me one.

32:03.834 --> 32:07.577
So, um, do you have
Lukas' address?

32:09.884 --> 32:11.277
[phone chimes]

32:11.320 --> 32:13.714
Oh, my connection
just came through.

32:13.757 --> 32:15.759
I'm gonna need
some cash fast.

32:15.803 --> 32:18.110
Uh, yeah, I'll get you
all Lukas' info.

32:18.153 --> 32:19.328
How to get into the
house, everything.

32:19.372 --> 32:21.983
Let's go get
some money.

32:22.027 --> 32:23.767
Let's go get some money.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.471
Hey.Hey.

32:31.514 --> 32:34.300
She give you Meyer's info yet?

32:35.866 --> 32:36.998
Here she comes.

32:37.042 --> 32:39.609
Hey, uh, Mia, this is Max.
Max, this is Mia.

32:39.653 --> 32:40.828
Hey.Hey.

32:40.871 --> 32:42.264
We've got maybe a day
before he realizes

32:42.308 --> 32:43.396
money's leaving his account.

32:43.439 --> 32:44.701
Okay.You get what you need?

32:44.745 --> 32:46.486
Yeah.

32:50.925 --> 32:53.014
How much?3,000.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.755
Don't worry, I know
Megan's good for it.

32:54.798 --> 32:58.280
No. No debts to men.
She owes you nothing.

32:58.324 --> 33:00.761
It's completely clean, right?

33:00.804 --> 33:02.850
Yeah, wiped down with bleach,
no serial numbers,

33:02.893 --> 33:05.331
and the barrel's be re-honed so
it won't match any ballistics.

33:05.374 --> 33:07.681
That's a lot of cash, Mia.

33:07.724 --> 33:10.466
I need a lot of oxy.

33:10.510 --> 33:11.772
This one's for you.

33:13.948 --> 33:15.515
N-No, thank you, um, I can't.

33:15.558 --> 33:17.996
Hey, how much is my life worth?

33:22.261 --> 33:24.219
[horn honks]

33:24.263 --> 33:25.829
There's my connection.

33:25.873 --> 33:28.093
Okay, remember this address.
Don't enter it in your phone.

33:28.136 --> 33:30.051
4401 Windsor Drive.

33:30.095 --> 33:31.313
It's in Long Beach.

33:31.357 --> 33:32.706
The garage door on the
side is always open,

33:32.749 --> 33:33.707
but there's an alarm.

33:33.750 --> 33:36.101
The code is 0406.

33:36.144 --> 33:38.668
Lukas passes out stone-cold
drunk about 1:00 most nights.

33:41.541 --> 33:43.151
So I guess this is goodbye.

33:44.196 --> 33:46.198
You're-you're leaving?

33:46.241 --> 33:49.897
I have to get as far away
from you as I can, right?

33:51.551 --> 33:54.380
Yeah.Be safe, Megan.

33:55.903 --> 33:58.123
I know you'll stay clean
if you really try.

33:58.166 --> 34:01.517
I can tell, there's a very
strong person in there.

34:06.957 --> 34:10.048
I don't want to cry.
[sniffles]

34:16.141 --> 34:17.446
Be safe.

34:17.490 --> 34:19.057
[shutter clicks]

34:19.100 --> 34:20.971
DEEKS:
Fatima, did you get
that address?

34:21.015 --> 34:22.234
FATIMA:
Got it.

34:22.277 --> 34:23.539
Tell the REACT team
to meet us there,

34:23.583 --> 34:25.019
make sure they know
that Lukas Meyer

34:25.063 --> 34:26.890
is heavily armed
and extremely dangerous.

34:29.197 --> 34:30.938
You get this tap?

34:30.981 --> 34:32.374
Walker called
Collins twice.

34:32.418 --> 34:35.073
Sounds like they're
talking in code. Play it.

34:35.986 --> 34:37.379
WALKER:
How are the grandkids?

34:37.423 --> 34:40.817
COLLINS:
All good. The family decided
not to move.

34:40.861 --> 34:42.558
They're gonna stay
in the same house.

34:42.602 --> 34:44.256
WALKER:
So everything stays
just as it is.

34:44.299 --> 34:45.518
Exactly.

34:45.561 --> 34:46.954
It does seem like
they're saying all's good,

34:46.997 --> 34:48.216
stick to the location,

34:48.260 --> 34:50.000
stick to the plan.Doesn't make any sense

34:50.044 --> 34:52.002
if Collins still
needs to acquire the guns.

34:52.046 --> 34:53.221
Kensi and Deeks
have an address on Meyer.

34:53.265 --> 34:55.354
They're six minutes out.Look, we have been

34:55.397 --> 34:56.616
wrong about this
for two days now, okay?

34:56.659 --> 34:58.270
We are-we're missing something.

34:58.313 --> 35:00.750
We keep waiting for Collins to
buy the guns from Lukas Meyer.

35:00.794 --> 35:02.230
But he's not talking to Meyer.

35:02.274 --> 35:03.579
He's talking to Walker.

35:03.623 --> 35:07.105
What if Meyer and Collins
already made the deal,

35:07.148 --> 35:08.367
it already went down?

35:08.410 --> 35:10.151
Even before
the ATF agents were killed.

35:10.195 --> 35:13.023
Would mean that Collins has
had the guns this entire time.

35:13.067 --> 35:14.808
Would explain
the empty warehouse.

35:14.851 --> 35:16.331
They already made the sale.

35:16.375 --> 35:17.898
Collins would be really eager

35:17.941 --> 35:19.378
to get those illegal weapons
out of his hands.

35:19.421 --> 35:21.162
Do you have a GPS
on Walker's phone?

35:21.206 --> 35:23.164
A storage facility in Sylmar.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.774
Collins could be
transferring the guns

35:24.818 --> 35:26.428
to the militia as we speak.Have a REACT team

35:26.472 --> 35:28.126
meet us there.I'm on it.

35:44.446 --> 35:45.708
In position.

35:45.752 --> 35:48.102
Three, two, one.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.799
Execute! Execute!

35:49.843 --> 35:51.192
Hands where we can see them!

35:51.236 --> 35:53.107
[gasps]
Oh, my God.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.544
Clear!Clear!

35:55.588 --> 35:57.024
What the hell?

35:57.067 --> 35:58.025
AGENT:
All clear.

35:58.068 --> 36:00.158
There's nothing.

36:02.247 --> 36:04.162
She had no reason
to lie to me.

36:04.205 --> 36:06.164
[gunfire]

36:08.122 --> 36:10.472
ATF was already here.We heard.

36:15.825 --> 36:17.479
WALKER:
I give up!

36:18.915 --> 36:21.135
I'm coming out.
Don't shoot!

36:21.179 --> 36:22.702
AGENT:
Let's go! Move it!

36:25.270 --> 36:26.836
Let's get this truck open.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.360
Go, go, go, go. Move.

36:28.403 --> 36:29.926
Is that all of them?One fled to another building

36:29.970 --> 36:31.232
on the north side.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.060
We got a team
tracking him now.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.630
Let's go!

36:37.673 --> 36:40.067
You think this is everything?

36:40.110 --> 36:41.155
It sure looks like it.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.984
[indistinct chatter]

36:44.027 --> 36:46.116
AGENT 2:
We got the last one.
Bringing him to you.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.248
All good?

36:59.739 --> 37:02.089
Little late, gentlemen.

37:02.132 --> 37:05.223
General Collins.

37:08.400 --> 37:09.531
[short chuckle]

37:15.450 --> 37:17.147
Let's stow this stuff
and go home.

37:17.191 --> 37:19.280
Amen to that.

37:19.324 --> 37:22.283
FATIMA: Guys, you're not
gonna believe this.What's going on?

37:22.327 --> 37:24.416
We just got a report from LAPD.

37:24.459 --> 37:26.418
Lukas Meyer was found dead
in an apartment

37:26.461 --> 37:28.289
in Hollywood 30 minutes ago.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.552
Dead?
What was the cause of death?

37:30.596 --> 37:32.293
No trauma.

37:32.337 --> 37:34.164
Uh, LAPD ordered
a toxicology screen,

37:34.208 --> 37:37.298
but the detectives on site
say that there was evidence

37:37.342 --> 37:39.387
of an oxycodone overdose.

37:39.431 --> 37:40.780
They think he drank a bunch.

37:40.823 --> 37:42.303
Oh, my God.

37:42.347 --> 37:43.957
I pulled some security footage
from the apartment.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.306
This is all I could get.

37:47.352 --> 37:48.918
Is that Mia?

37:49.963 --> 37:51.399
Could be.

37:52.444 --> 37:53.575
Uh...

37:53.619 --> 37:55.664
all right, let ATF know.

37:56.926 --> 37:58.319
This guy killed
seven of their agents.

37:58.363 --> 38:00.365
Maybe this will give them
some sort of closure.

38:00.408 --> 38:01.540
Will do.

38:01.583 --> 38:03.542
Oh, and when Mia
went into the bank,

38:03.585 --> 38:06.545
she transferred over $200,000

38:06.588 --> 38:08.764
to an undetermined
offshore account.

38:08.808 --> 38:10.592
We're still trying to find it.

38:10.636 --> 38:13.900
Yeah, you're not going to.
She's too smart.

38:13.943 --> 38:16.598
I'll keep trying.
Good night, guys.

38:16.642 --> 38:18.905
Did she play you?

38:20.428 --> 38:22.343
She didn't have to.

38:22.387 --> 38:23.692
Didn't need me for any of this.

38:23.736 --> 38:25.912
Yeah, but you gave her
the idea.

38:27.087 --> 38:28.915
Maybe the courage to do it.

38:36.879 --> 38:39.882
There are a lot of things

38:39.926 --> 38:42.842
that Hetty and I
don't agree on.

38:43.973 --> 38:45.801
But...

38:45.845 --> 38:48.935
the joy of a 16-year-old
single malt

38:48.978 --> 38:52.199
has always been
our common ground.

38:53.548 --> 38:56.116
Probably also kept us
from killing each other.

38:56.159 --> 38:58.031
Have you heard from her?

38:59.337 --> 39:01.034
Haven't.

39:01.077 --> 39:04.124
And I don't imagine
I will for a while.

39:04.167 --> 39:06.082
Do you know if she's safe?

39:07.127 --> 39:09.042
What do you think,
Agent Callen?

39:09.085 --> 39:10.826
Probably not.

39:10.870 --> 39:12.872
Probably not.

39:14.482 --> 39:17.616
So, Agent Hanna.

39:20.096 --> 39:21.271
Why didn't you tell us
you knew Collins

39:21.315 --> 39:22.708
still had the weapons?

39:22.751 --> 39:25.972
'Cause I got damn tired
of fighting with my partner.

39:26.015 --> 39:28.278
That's right,
I said partner,

39:28.322 --> 39:29.932
and that's what you were
on this case.

39:29.976 --> 39:33.109
Why didn't you call me
when you figured out

39:33.153 --> 39:35.024
where the weapons were?

39:35.068 --> 39:36.722
You know why.

39:36.765 --> 39:39.246
Trust.Trust.

39:39.289 --> 39:43.685
Something that is not assumed
by men like you and me.

39:43.729 --> 39:45.470
It has to be earned.

39:45.513 --> 39:47.254
Well...

39:47.297 --> 39:50.605
I hope I earned
a little from you today.

39:51.650 --> 39:52.999
Little bit.

39:53.042 --> 39:55.131
[chuckles]

39:55.175 --> 39:57.786
Well, we're all gonna
have to earn more,

39:57.830 --> 39:59.527
and fast.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.616
Especially now that
I am officially

40:01.660 --> 40:04.576
running the Office
of Special Projects.

40:07.492 --> 40:08.797
Way to bury the lede.

40:10.277 --> 40:13.019
You both could have had
this chair, you know that.

40:13.062 --> 40:15.543
Well, we didn't want it.Good.

40:15.587 --> 40:19.417
Be a tragedy to lose men
like you in the field.

40:21.244 --> 40:23.638
So, gentlemen,
raise your glasses

40:23.682 --> 40:27.250
as I ask you to help me
to make this team

40:27.294 --> 40:28.904
the very best it can be.

40:28.948 --> 40:31.341
Of course.

40:31.385 --> 40:33.692
Absolutely, Admiral.

40:33.735 --> 40:36.912
Hoo-yah.Hoo-yah.

40:46.139 --> 40:48.489
[phone vibrates]

40:48.533 --> 40:50.665
DEEKS:
Is that my mom?

40:50.709 --> 40:52.188
[soft chuckle]

40:55.061 --> 40:57.455
No. It's Mia.

40:57.498 --> 40:59.674
It's forwarded
from Megan's phone.

40:59.718 --> 41:01.371
MIA:
Hey, Megan,

41:01.415 --> 41:03.852
I'm sorry about the address.

41:03.896 --> 41:06.986
I just couldn't have you
screwing up your life.

41:07.029 --> 41:09.162
You were too good to me
to let that happen.

41:09.205 --> 41:10.337
That's all.

41:11.730 --> 41:13.949
Oh, and don't text back.

41:13.993 --> 41:15.995
I got to go on the DL
for a while,

41:16.038 --> 41:17.823
so by the time you get this,
this phone is gonna be

41:17.866 --> 41:19.302
at the bottom of the ocean.

41:19.346 --> 41:21.479
Take care of yourself.

41:22.523 --> 41:24.699
And thanks for giving a damn
about me.

41:32.141 --> 41:34.143
She was protecting me.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.190
Should we call Fatima,

41:37.233 --> 41:38.539
see if she can
find that phone?

41:38.583 --> 41:40.628
Maybe she hasn't
tossed it yet.

41:43.762 --> 41:45.024
No.

41:45.067 --> 41:46.852
[clears throat]

41:46.895 --> 41:49.028
We can do it
in the morning.

41:49.071 --> 41:51.596
[sighs]

41:51.639 --> 41:54.468
Just to clarify--

41:54.512 --> 41:56.383
by the time morning
runs around,

41:56.426 --> 41:58.254
she's gonna be long gone.

42:02.607 --> 42:04.739
And that's a good thing.

42:09.178 --> 42:11.093
That's a good thing.

42:16.708 --> 42:18.405
Okay.

42:22.452 --> 42:25.194
Sweet dreams, my beautiful
little velociraptor.
