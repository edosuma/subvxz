WEBVTT

01:27.880 --> 01:29.248
There you go.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.802
You go back to
the fuckin' shelter.

01:49.835 --> 01:52.772
You smell like the fuckin'
third floor of the shelter.

01:52.805 --> 01:56.341
Yeah, we back... we back
in the dressing room now, yeah.

01:56.375 --> 01:58.443
The Commission in here.
They... wrap...

01:58.477 --> 02:00.279
watch-watching 'em wrap
Billy hands.

02:01.513 --> 02:03.849
Yeah, it's all right.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.997
Yeah, but once he gets
in the inside, it's over.

02:18.030 --> 02:19.765
Make that step, it's over.

02:52.497 --> 02:55.768
Yeah. I'll text you
as soon as he's done, okay?

02:55.801 --> 02:57.102
Yeah. I love you, too.

02:57.136 --> 02:58.370
Hi, Jordan.

02:58.403 --> 03:00.039
Okay. Yeah. Do your homework.

03:00.072 --> 03:01.473
Hey, y'all
give him a minute.

03:01.506 --> 03:04.043
- Hey, hey, guys.
- Hey, Mo. What's up?

03:04.076 --> 03:05.377
What's up?

03:05.410 --> 03:07.146
Yeah, let's get out.

03:17.790 --> 03:19.291
Hey.

03:22.928 --> 03:25.564
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

03:25.597 --> 03:27.066
You're ready.

03:28.700 --> 03:31.003
Don't get hit too much.

03:47.386 --> 03:51.256
Hard shots from Darius Jones

03:51.290 --> 03:53.292
to the body and the head,

03:53.325 --> 03:55.594
as he continues putting distance

03:55.627 --> 04:00.299
between himself and Billy Hope
on the scorecards.

04:00.332 --> 04:02.234
This kid Jones is super fast,

04:02.267 --> 04:05.437
and he's killing Billy
with just his left hand.

04:05.470 --> 04:08.340
Jones,
a longer, quicker fighter,

04:08.373 --> 04:10.375
has appeared to win
most of the rounds

04:10.409 --> 04:12.377
to this point in the fight.

04:12.411 --> 04:14.313
Keep them hands up!
Protect that eye!

04:14.346 --> 04:16.648
Come on, chief!
Come on, move!

04:17.950 --> 04:20.119
There you go!

04:20.152 --> 04:23.088
And the crowd comes alive
as Hope lands a right and a left.

04:23.122 --> 04:25.290
Okay, here we go,
here we go.

04:26.992 --> 04:28.928
Good body shots by Hope.

04:28.961 --> 04:30.729
- Dance with me, bitch.
- Let him go.

04:30.762 --> 04:32.031
There he goes
again with that attitude.

04:32.064 --> 04:33.765
He never stops.

04:33.799 --> 04:35.734
It's another
frustrating round for Hope.

04:35.767 --> 04:38.037
He all right.
He ain't hurt him.

04:40.973 --> 04:42.942
It's give and take,
ebb and flow,

04:42.975 --> 04:44.509
here in this fight.

04:44.543 --> 04:46.645
Come on, Billy,
turn the shit back!

04:46.678 --> 04:48.814
As Jones drives him back

04:48.848 --> 04:50.749
- with another uppercut.
- Whoa, good uppercut.

04:50.782 --> 04:52.551
And now Jones again
going to the body...

04:52.584 --> 04:54.253
Come on, baby,
get off those ropes!

04:54.286 --> 04:55.888
...trying to set up the finish

04:55.921 --> 04:57.990
as he drives Hope back
into the ropes again.

04:58.023 --> 05:00.025
I got you, man. I got you.

05:00.059 --> 05:01.861
- Huh? That's all you got?
- Uh-huh.

05:01.894 --> 05:03.996
That's all you got, huh?

05:05.564 --> 05:07.566
Watching,
close to Hope's corner,

05:07.599 --> 05:10.535
his beautiful wife, Maureen,

05:10.569 --> 05:13.672
herself a product
of a Hell's Kitchen orphanage.

05:13.705 --> 05:16.708
- How's the eye?
- Take many more, it's gonna flow.

05:16.741 --> 05:18.543
Yeah, just fix
the fuckin' eye.

05:18.577 --> 05:20.579
State Commission
doctor taking a good look

05:20.612 --> 05:24.216
at Hope's left eye
in the corner.

05:24.249 --> 05:26.285
But the fight will continue.

05:26.318 --> 05:29.088
We've seen Billy Hope
win fights in the past

05:29.121 --> 05:32.457
looking even more the worse
for wear than is the case here.

05:32.491 --> 05:34.293
Nothing has changed tonight.

05:34.326 --> 05:35.995
Seated at ringside,

05:36.028 --> 05:38.563
light heavyweight contender
Miguel "Magic" Escobar,

05:38.597 --> 05:40.365
who would love
to fight the winner.

05:40.399 --> 05:42.601
Okay, keep him on
the end of your stick.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.536
And don't stand
in front of him.

05:44.569 --> 05:47.873
Get yours, relocate. It's like
the bull and the matador.

05:47.907 --> 05:50.575
This is your fuckin' ring.
You're the fuckin' champ, right?

05:50.609 --> 05:52.244
Just go back in and do what
we do; you gotta end this.

05:52.277 --> 05:53.812
Hey, Billy. Billy.

05:53.845 --> 05:56.181
All right, do me a favor
and keep those hands up.

05:56.215 --> 05:58.317
Billy, stay focused.

05:58.350 --> 06:01.253
End it. You don't have time
for this bullshit.

06:01.286 --> 06:02.687
Put an end to this
so we can go the fuck home.

06:02.721 --> 06:04.356
What do you think
I'm trying to do, Eli?

06:04.389 --> 06:05.891
What do you think
I'm trying to do?

06:05.925 --> 06:07.759
Get the shit off my eye!
Let's go! Come on!

06:09.661 --> 06:12.164
Round ten about to begin.

06:17.302 --> 06:19.538
Watch that jab, watch the jab.

06:19.571 --> 06:23.909
Billy Hope still
with that bleeding left eye.

06:23.943 --> 06:28.380
Those who love him would say,
"Defense? What is that?"

06:28.413 --> 06:29.848
- And a hard right cross!
- Yeah, Hope hurt him!

06:29.881 --> 06:31.583
That's it, baby,
that's it.

06:31.616 --> 06:33.352
Good body shot by Darius Jones.

06:33.385 --> 06:34.920
Giving Hope
a little of his medicine,

06:34.954 --> 06:36.788
he comes back to the body
a second time.

06:36.821 --> 06:38.623
He hurt Hope
with that body shot.

06:38.657 --> 06:40.825
Hard right by Hope
drives Jones

06:40.859 --> 06:42.627
back into the ropes.

06:42.661 --> 06:44.396
Let him go. Let him go.

06:44.429 --> 06:45.998
That's one
of the best clean shots

06:46.031 --> 06:48.667
Hope has landed
since the middle of the fight.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.036
And down goes Jones
on a left hook.

06:51.070 --> 06:52.804
Three...

06:52.837 --> 06:55.674
- four, five...
- Tremendous turnaround

06:55.707 --> 06:57.809
in favor of Hope,
here in round ten.

06:57.842 --> 07:00.312
- Come to me, come to me.
- Wow, what a shot!

07:00.345 --> 07:02.247
You stay on him, Billy,
stay on him.

07:02.281 --> 07:04.383
- Are you good? You good? All right.
- I'm good. I'm good.

07:04.416 --> 07:05.951
Tony Weeks is
gonna let him keep fighting.

07:05.985 --> 07:07.852
- Oh!
- But not for long!

07:07.886 --> 07:12.557
And another right hand
may have ended the fight.

07:12.591 --> 07:14.859
...six, seven...

07:14.893 --> 07:15.995
eight...

07:16.028 --> 07:17.462
nine...

07:17.496 --> 07:18.998
That's it.

07:19.031 --> 07:21.633
This is over!

07:21.666 --> 07:24.136
A comeback knockout win
for Billy Hope.

07:24.169 --> 07:27.339
I told you, Jim,
as long as there's a Billy,

07:27.372 --> 07:29.975
there is Hope...
He always has a chance.

07:30.009 --> 07:31.710
So light heavyweight
champ Billy Hope

07:31.743 --> 07:34.113
has a fourth consecutive
title defense

07:34.146 --> 07:36.548
in Madison Square Garden.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.517
Let's go to David Diamante

07:38.550 --> 07:40.819
for the official particulars
on the KO.

07:40.852 --> 07:44.189
Ladies and gentlemen, from
the world's most famous arena,

07:44.223 --> 07:47.792
Madison Square Garden, the
official time of the stoppage:

07:47.826 --> 07:51.930
one minute and 18 seconds
of round number ten.

07:51.963 --> 07:54.266
Your winner by knockout,

07:54.299 --> 07:56.801
still undefeated and still

07:56.835 --> 08:00.005
the undisputed WBC,

08:00.039 --> 08:03.375
WBA, WBO,

08:03.408 --> 08:08.913
and IBF Light Heavyweight
Champion of the World...

08:08.947 --> 08:14.486
Billy "The Great" Hope!

08:14.519 --> 08:18.123
He reminds us of the
great, late Matthew Saad Muhammad.

08:18.157 --> 08:22.294
Just when you think there's no
hope left, here comes Billy.

08:22.327 --> 08:25.030
From an orphanage
in Hell's Kitchen

08:25.064 --> 08:29.268
to a professional career fighting
in Madison Square Garden

08:29.301 --> 08:34.673
is a distance of only a few blocks...
and a million miles.

08:34.706 --> 08:37.775
But it's a journey Billy Hope
has made in his life.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.845
Billy! Billy! Billy!

08:51.490 --> 08:53.125
Hey, Jon Jon,

08:53.158 --> 08:55.460
take the belts out for
the press conference, yeah?

08:55.494 --> 08:58.029
- The new one?
- With the other ones in the back of the car.

08:58.063 --> 08:59.998
Yo, I'll bring that, Mikey.
You bring that one.

09:00.031 --> 09:02.567
- See you at the press conference.
- Come on, Big Mike.

09:02.601 --> 09:05.804
- We got a press conference.
- All right, we'll see you there.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.608
Thanks, Eli.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.087
Hey.

09:22.121 --> 09:24.055
- No.
- I don't know what that is...

09:24.089 --> 09:25.824
- Come here.
- I'm bleeding out of my mouth, baby.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.259
I don't know
when it's coming clean.

09:27.292 --> 09:28.993
What's that, baby?

09:32.497 --> 09:33.932
- What'd you say?
- It's fine, babe.

09:33.965 --> 09:35.367
You want some water?

09:35.400 --> 09:37.802
Yeah. I'm just gonna
take a shower first.

09:37.836 --> 09:39.504
No, no, no.

09:39.538 --> 09:41.039
Can you get
your socks off?

09:41.072 --> 09:42.507
Yourself?

09:42.541 --> 09:44.909
Yeah. I'll just fuckin'
shower in 'em.

09:56.955 --> 09:59.858
Billy!

09:59.891 --> 10:02.594
- Okay, Mike, go ahead.
- Billy, most of us here

10:02.627 --> 10:04.363
had you winning this early.

10:04.396 --> 10:06.131
Were you expecting
such a difficult fight?

10:06.165 --> 10:08.867
Oh. Heh.
Yeah, I don't know, "expect"?

10:08.900 --> 10:11.236
I don't know.
You can't expect anything.

10:11.270 --> 10:14.873
Um, I-I was really looking
forward to just showing up,

10:14.906 --> 10:17.442
walk in the ring, and then
having him fall on the ground.

10:19.344 --> 10:21.045
Billy. Hey, Billy.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.881
No, man, I mean...

10:22.914 --> 10:25.884
I expected a hard fight.
You know? Um...

10:25.917 --> 10:28.253
I put my family
through a lot. Uh...

10:28.287 --> 10:29.888
by the way, Leila,

10:29.921 --> 10:31.523
if you're watching,
go to sleep, baby.

10:33.525 --> 10:35.527
Billy. Hey, Billy, Billy.

10:35.560 --> 10:39.964
Billy. You're 43 and 0... undefeated.
Are you running out of legitimate...

10:39.998 --> 10:42.167
Sorry, can you say that again?

10:42.201 --> 10:44.703
It's impressive.

10:44.736 --> 10:46.905
But who are you gonna fight?
Who are you gonna fight?

10:46.938 --> 10:49.308
- Uh, you know, that's really Jordan and me...
- I think I know one!

10:49.341 --> 10:50.975
Me!

10:53.445 --> 10:56.114
I mean, all the fans around the
world, they want to see it.

10:56.147 --> 10:58.883
Y'all tell me, who else is there?
Your crew knows it.

10:58.917 --> 11:01.052
All these beautiful people
in here know it.

11:01.085 --> 11:04.956
I know it. I just want to know
why you won't give me my shot.

11:04.989 --> 11:06.725
All I want is my shot.
I just want my shot.

11:06.758 --> 11:08.860
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Who are you?

11:08.893 --> 11:11.296
You know exactly
who I am, baby.

11:11.330 --> 11:13.965
- He's just trying to make a fight.
- And you're that contender?

11:13.998 --> 11:15.934
You ain't never been hit
by a real man.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.702
All right?

11:17.736 --> 11:20.672
Who's got that...

11:20.705 --> 11:24.008
It's pretty clear that he hasn't
really been hit at all yet, huh?

11:24.042 --> 11:26.177
What are you drinking in that cup, man?

11:26.211 --> 11:27.779
Hey, you know what?
You ain't no champ.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.714
You're all show
and you know that.

11:29.748 --> 11:31.550
Why you so scared
to fight me, Billy?

11:31.583 --> 11:33.718
We all came and gave
a good show tonight,

11:33.752 --> 11:37.222
didn't we, Jordan? Yeah? And I'm pretty
sure we did business, didn't we?

11:37.256 --> 11:39.791
Yeah, all right.
Y'all have a good night, okay?

11:39.824 --> 11:42.327
Sign the contract, baby!

11:42.361 --> 11:45.063
- Gonna be a fight, Billy?
- Just sign the contract, baby!

11:45.096 --> 11:46.798
Is there going to be a fight?

11:46.831 --> 11:49.200
- I want you to line it up!
- Line it up?

11:49.234 --> 11:50.635
Miguel's just
showboating, Billy.

11:50.669 --> 11:52.571
I'm gonna shut him the fuck up.

11:52.604 --> 11:54.773
Line it up.

11:54.806 --> 11:56.875
Turay just makes sense.
If it makes money,

11:56.908 --> 11:58.643
it makes sense. Two for the
bills, one for the belt.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.612
The Turay fight
makes better sense.

12:00.645 --> 12:02.781
No, no, no. You think
Miguel's a better fighter?

12:02.814 --> 12:04.849
No. I didn't say that.
I didn't say that.

12:04.883 --> 12:07.051
What do I got to do? What do
I got to do, say it again?

12:07.085 --> 12:09.120
- You want me to say it again?
- You want to fight me?

12:09.153 --> 12:11.923
Do you want to say it again?
What do you want me to do?

12:11.956 --> 12:13.396
Why do you do this
in front of all...

12:15.494 --> 12:17.161
What happened?

12:17.195 --> 12:20.399
- What's the problem, Billy?
- Hey, yo, yo, I'm sorry.

12:20.432 --> 12:23.001
I'm sorry about that.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.769
- I'll just...
- Don't worry about it. Go on.

12:24.803 --> 12:27.238
- Just, come on, man.
- Don't worry about this.

13:21.192 --> 13:23.628
I want
to get you out of this dress.

13:23.662 --> 13:25.864
Yeah, me, too.
You have no idea.

13:25.897 --> 13:27.332
Hey, Lee,
put those in the office.

13:27.366 --> 13:29.334
- Ugh!
- Come on. Come with me.

13:29.368 --> 13:32.070
- Come with me. Where you going?
- What?

13:32.103 --> 13:34.406
- Come with me.
- Let me put my stuff down.

13:34.439 --> 13:35.840
I got to get
you some ice...

13:35.874 --> 13:37.376
- Leila?
- And some food...

13:37.409 --> 13:38.777
Leila?

13:38.810 --> 13:40.278
Hey, hey. Shh.

13:40.311 --> 13:41.846
She might be sleeping.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.548
- Leila...
- Hey.

13:43.582 --> 13:45.517
- How's it going, Gloria?
- Congratulations, Mr. Billy.

13:45.550 --> 13:47.218
Is she up? Is she up?

13:47.251 --> 13:49.788
Yeah, she's probably
still waiting up for you.

13:49.821 --> 13:52.256
Tell me she didn't
watch that fight.

13:57.261 --> 13:59.063
Oh, I saw you.

13:59.097 --> 14:00.298
I saw you.

14:00.331 --> 14:02.033
Don't try and fool me.

14:02.066 --> 14:04.669
I'm coming for my hug.

14:06.270 --> 14:07.672
Hey, wake up.

14:07.706 --> 14:10.008
Aw! You... Yeah... Oh.

14:10.041 --> 14:11.643
Hi, baby.

14:11.676 --> 14:14.513
Oh, I missed you so much.

14:14.546 --> 14:16.915
I missed you, Daddy.

14:20.184 --> 14:21.420
Can I count?

14:21.453 --> 14:22.887
Mm-hmm.

14:26.357 --> 14:28.326
That's a big one.

14:28.359 --> 14:29.628
Yeah.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.263
Mm.

14:35.133 --> 14:36.334
Eight.

14:36.367 --> 14:37.669
Mm.

14:37.702 --> 14:39.971
- You got hit a lot, Dad.
- Yeah,

14:40.004 --> 14:41.272
you should see the other guy.

14:41.305 --> 14:42.707
No, she should not.

14:42.741 --> 14:44.208
- Aw.
- She needs to go to bed.

14:44.242 --> 14:45.944
And so do you. Come on.

14:45.977 --> 14:48.146
Party's over. Come on.

14:48.179 --> 14:50.214
Why can't I go
see the fights?

14:50.248 --> 14:51.816
Oh, 'cause your mother
thinks they're too...

14:51.850 --> 14:53.518
Why can't she go
to your fights?

14:53.552 --> 14:55.654
Your mom thinks they're
too violent, baby, come on.

14:55.687 --> 14:57.822
But I see stuff like that
on TV all the time.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.658
- I know you do.
- What do you mean?

14:59.691 --> 15:01.125
I watch "The Walking Dead"
with Gloria.

15:01.159 --> 15:02.827
All right,
that's gonna stop.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.663
You, up. Come on,
this is your hint.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.998
- Okay, all right.
- Come on.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.700
Time for bed.
Please... no...

15:08.733 --> 15:10.134
- Dad will let me.
- She has a phone?

15:10.168 --> 15:11.803
She's had a phone
for two months.

15:11.836 --> 15:13.404
Why are you looking at me
like I'm crazy?

15:13.438 --> 15:15.339
'Cause you asked me
to get her the phone?

15:15.373 --> 15:16.908
- Get a ten-year-old a phone?
- Out, out, out.

15:16.941 --> 15:18.376
Do you have
the pass code on it?

15:18.409 --> 15:20.011
Dad would say yes.

15:20.044 --> 15:23.014
Well, sometimes I think
your daddy confuses you

15:23.047 --> 15:25.984
with the other children who
hang around him night and day.

15:26.017 --> 15:27.652
You're talking
about Mikey and Jon Jon, right?

15:27.686 --> 15:29.153
That's right, baby.

15:29.187 --> 15:30.722
Mm...
I love you so much.

15:30.755 --> 15:31.856
I'm serious.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.658
Okay. Come on. Bedtime.

15:33.692 --> 15:35.426
Hey, get away
from my daughter.

15:35.460 --> 15:36.995
You, get out.
Get out.

15:37.028 --> 15:38.597
Go away, Dad.

15:38.630 --> 15:41.666
Good night.

15:41.700 --> 15:43.502
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

15:43.535 --> 15:45.203
What would you like?

15:45.236 --> 15:48.840
I want...
I want to take a break.

15:48.873 --> 15:52.511
I was just thinking we could
maybe blow off the Turay match,

15:52.544 --> 15:54.846
rethink things, pick a fight

15:54.879 --> 15:58.049
- for later next year, you know.
- Wait a minute.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.450
Why?

15:59.484 --> 16:01.486
I didn't like
what I saw tonight.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.422
What did you see tonight?
You saw me win tonight.

16:04.455 --> 16:05.824
Baby, look at your face.

16:05.857 --> 16:07.125
What are you talking about?

16:08.627 --> 16:10.762
Look at your face.

16:12.964 --> 16:14.432
Baby, what are you saying?

16:16.134 --> 16:18.036
Hey, baby,
can I ask you something?

16:18.069 --> 16:19.938
- What?
- What if I said this...

16:19.971 --> 16:22.040
"Look at your face.
Look at your face,"

16:22.073 --> 16:24.809
and then I started
crying? Okay?

16:26.310 --> 16:27.546
I'm sorry.

16:27.579 --> 16:29.013
Nah, it's-it's all good.

16:29.047 --> 16:30.515
- I'm sorry, but...
- It's good.

16:30.549 --> 16:31.916
...you fucking scared me.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.718
You can't fight
like that anymore.

16:33.752 --> 16:35.520
Baby, we... we won tonight.

16:35.554 --> 16:38.422
Yeah, but it's the way
you're fighting.

16:40.324 --> 16:42.527
- What are you talking about?
- Oh...

16:44.128 --> 16:46.264
The way I fight
bought us this house

16:46.297 --> 16:48.332
and bought you that
fucking beautiful dress.

16:48.366 --> 16:49.868
Yes, I know. I know.

16:49.901 --> 16:51.603
And it gave Leila
that fucking private school.

16:51.636 --> 16:54.038
- I know, baby. I know.
- All the shit in this house.

16:54.072 --> 16:56.040
Our fucking life,
that's what my fighting bought.

16:56.074 --> 16:57.776
But I want to enjoy it.

16:57.809 --> 16:59.811
- Where is this coming from?
- With you.

17:04.147 --> 17:07.018
This is the talk you have when
you lose, not when you win.

17:08.619 --> 17:11.089
The more you get hit,
the harder you fight. I get it.

17:11.122 --> 17:12.557
I don't want to hear
this right now.

17:12.590 --> 17:14.425
Only now you're taking
way too many hits

17:14.458 --> 17:16.426
- before you get off.
- Hey. Listen to me.

17:16.460 --> 17:18.029
This was a good night...

17:18.061 --> 17:20.865
I love you.
You are all I care about.

17:20.898 --> 17:22.666
The three of us, that's it.

17:22.701 --> 17:24.068
That's all that matters.

17:24.102 --> 17:25.704
So I'm going to tell you
the truth.

17:25.737 --> 17:28.640
You're going to be punch-drunk
in two years

17:28.673 --> 17:30.541
if you keep this up.

17:34.312 --> 17:36.014
Think about her.

17:36.047 --> 17:38.983
When she graduates,
what do you want to look like?

17:41.052 --> 17:43.187
Fuck me.

17:43.221 --> 17:44.856
Fuck.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.227
Why do you got to lay

17:49.260 --> 17:51.295
the fucking truth right now?

17:51.329 --> 17:53.331
Fuck.

17:53.364 --> 17:55.133
You say it,
I'll do it, all right?

17:55.166 --> 17:57.201
You say it, I'll do it.

18:00.672 --> 18:03.041
Come here, baby.

18:03.074 --> 18:06.144
They're all gonna keep you in that
"Billy the Great" bubble, you know?

18:06.177 --> 18:07.946
And they'll take
their pound of flesh,

18:07.979 --> 18:10.715
but, baby, when
that bubble pops,

18:10.749 --> 18:14.753
they're all just gonna
scatter like roaches.

18:14.786 --> 18:18.723
And me and Leila are gonna
be here to pick up the pieces.

18:18.757 --> 18:20.892
There are no pieces.

18:25.764 --> 18:27.131
I know.

18:28.132 --> 18:30.134
Hey, you know what?

18:30.168 --> 18:31.970
- What?
- I wanna know...

18:32.003 --> 18:34.238
- you know how I only went ten rounds?
- What's that?

18:34.272 --> 18:37.742
I only went ten rounds tonight,
so do you know what that means?

18:37.776 --> 18:40.278
Mmm... what does that mean?

18:40.311 --> 18:43.314
That means that I still have...

18:45.817 --> 18:47.952
...two rounds left in me.

18:47.986 --> 18:49.487
Oh.

18:49.520 --> 18:52.223
You want to go two rounds
with me, champ?

18:52.256 --> 18:53.091
Mm-hmm.

18:53.124 --> 18:55.393
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.595
- That's very impressive.
- Mmm.

18:57.628 --> 18:59.764
Very brave.

19:05.904 --> 19:07.471
- Good.
- Good.

19:07.505 --> 19:08.907
Wow.

19:25.656 --> 19:27.959
Oh, fuck. Baby.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.360
Ow...

19:31.830 --> 19:33.031
Fuck...

20:09.167 --> 20:11.602
Uncle J, watch!

20:13.404 --> 20:15.639
That's another gold medal
in your future, missy.

20:15.673 --> 20:17.776
- Flip a little higher.
- No, no, no!

20:17.809 --> 20:19.911
No. No, no, no... no flips.

20:19.944 --> 20:21.279
Not too high, baby.

20:21.312 --> 20:23.147
- Yeah, she's good.
- Heh heh.

20:23.181 --> 20:27.318
Oh, I got, uh,
got a few things for you.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.287
I put that together
for the people over at HBO.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.389
It's a two-year,
three-fight deal.

20:31.422 --> 20:32.556
Mm-hmm.

20:32.590 --> 20:34.625
Hey, whoever wins...

20:34.658 --> 20:35.994
whoever wins...

20:37.762 --> 20:40.899
- ...gets one of these.
- Again with the gifts?

20:40.932 --> 20:42.266
How much you spend
on this shit?

20:42.300 --> 20:43.935
Oh, shit, you all just won.

20:43.968 --> 20:45.536
Oh, yo, I owe some shit
to the government.

20:45.569 --> 20:47.405
Let me hock this shit.
Nah, just playing.

20:47.438 --> 20:49.107
Yo, is this the shit
with the bezel right here?

20:49.140 --> 20:50.741
Yo, this shit with the bezel?

20:50.775 --> 20:52.410
Yeah, Gabe, it got the bezel
just like the last deal.

20:52.443 --> 20:54.212
Ooh! Oh, this shit
got the bezel on it.

20:54.245 --> 20:55.947
You don't got these shits
in, like, big-boy sizes?

20:55.980 --> 20:58.149
- I win, you win. All right?
- That's too much.

20:58.182 --> 21:00.284
It's not gonna happen.

21:00.318 --> 21:02.186
Maureen, Billy's been
my fighter for ten years.

21:02.220 --> 21:04.188
I know what's best for him.

21:04.222 --> 21:06.057
And I've been his wife
for, like, a hundred.

21:06.090 --> 21:07.758
I know what's better for him.

21:07.792 --> 21:09.627
Come on, he needs time off.

21:09.660 --> 21:11.695
To do what? Sit on a beach
and watch the sun go down?

21:11.729 --> 21:13.998
- Yeah.
- How long he gonna do that, Mo?

21:14.032 --> 21:17.568
One week? Two weeks? Then he's
gonna start looking around.

21:17.601 --> 21:19.503
He'll fuck around
and bite his hand off

21:19.537 --> 21:21.005
if you don't give him something
else to do with them.

21:21.039 --> 21:22.673
Are you...

21:22.706 --> 21:24.208
Are you hustling me?

21:24.242 --> 21:25.944
We've been friends a long time.

21:25.977 --> 21:29.347
Look at this. He didn't have
to pay me a dime for this.

21:29.380 --> 21:31.349
You know, all of the
fighters is coming to me

21:31.382 --> 21:33.351
and coming to me because of
my relationship with Billy.

21:33.384 --> 21:35.253
- 'Cause we family, Mo.
- I know.

21:35.286 --> 21:37.088
- Daddy!
- Oh, man,

21:37.121 --> 21:39.457
we was talking about you
like a dog, champ.

21:39.490 --> 21:42.526
You should've heard the things Maureen was
saying about you. I said, "The champ?

21:42.560 --> 21:44.095
Never!"

21:44.128 --> 21:46.464
- Daddy, come jump with me!
- Okay.

21:46.497 --> 21:48.967
You okay?

21:49.000 --> 21:51.102
Yeah. How you doing?

21:51.135 --> 21:53.437
- Took me too long to get here.
- You okay?

21:53.471 --> 21:55.373
- Don't look at me like that.
- You been icing?

21:55.406 --> 21:57.741
- Look, Billy, I told Maureen...
- Yeah?

21:57.775 --> 22:00.845
I got HBO to commit
to $30 million.

22:00.879 --> 22:02.280
Ten million per fight.

22:02.313 --> 22:04.148
I just told you,
we're passing on Turay.

22:04.182 --> 22:05.884
Yeah, man.

22:05.917 --> 22:07.651
Daddy, come on!

22:07.685 --> 22:09.954
Make sure she doesn't
break her neck.

22:11.389 --> 22:14.125
- He's laughing.
- Oh, boy.

22:14.158 --> 22:17.061
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

22:19.830 --> 22:24.268
"I just want to thank everybody
from the Children's Club

22:24.302 --> 22:26.204
"'cause this place
saved my life.

22:26.237 --> 22:28.372
"I grew up in the system.

22:28.406 --> 22:31.709
My mother had me when she
was incarcerated."

22:31.742 --> 22:34.012
That... How do you spell
"incarcerated"?

22:34.045 --> 22:36.614
- You should say "in jail."
- I-N-C-A-R-C-E-R...

22:36.647 --> 22:39.017
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter, babe.

22:39.050 --> 22:41.953
"I got dumped into
foster care the..."

22:41.986 --> 22:44.188
I don't want to do this.
I can't do this.

22:44.222 --> 22:47.625
Hey, hey, come on.
It's okay, come here.

22:47.658 --> 22:49.727
- I don't want -to talk about this.
- What? What do you mean?

22:49.760 --> 22:52.096
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't need to stand up there

22:52.130 --> 22:54.432
in front of a whole group of people
and tell them my fucking life story.

22:54.465 --> 22:57.635
- I don't want to tell them.
- Stop, you're acting crazy. It's okay.

22:57.668 --> 22:59.570
No, they're gonna
look at me like I'm an idiot.

22:59.603 --> 23:01.572
No, they love you.
Those kids love you.

23:01.605 --> 23:03.241
And it's for them.
It's a charity, baby.

23:03.274 --> 23:05.776
Don't be nervous.
You're fine. Okay?

23:05.809 --> 23:07.311
Okay?

23:07.345 --> 23:09.180
Put your pants on.

23:09.213 --> 23:11.349
Let's go,
so we can get home, okay?

23:11.382 --> 23:13.384
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

23:17.055 --> 23:18.789
Hey, Leila.

23:21.192 --> 23:23.027
I'm gonna tell you something.

23:23.061 --> 23:24.462
And it is very important.

23:24.495 --> 23:26.864
Okay? I want you to listen.

23:26.897 --> 23:28.032
- I love you.
- I...

23:28.066 --> 23:29.533
I love you.

23:29.567 --> 23:30.935
So predictable.

23:30.969 --> 23:31.969
Man.

23:33.871 --> 23:36.207
The Children's Club of New York

23:36.240 --> 23:37.841
would like to welcome

23:37.875 --> 23:39.477
the Light Heavyweight Champion
of the world,

23:39.510 --> 23:41.179
Billy Hope.

23:47.385 --> 23:49.620
Uh, um...

23:49.653 --> 23:51.122
All right, all right,
all right.

23:51.155 --> 23:52.723
I'd rather take
a couple punches

23:52.756 --> 23:54.758
than be up, be up here,
but, um...

24:05.569 --> 24:07.871
Well, I wouldn't be
up here tonight,

24:07.905 --> 24:11.842
uh, if it wasn't for the...
for... for the Children's Club.

24:11.875 --> 24:13.644
They gave me a bed.

24:13.677 --> 24:16.347
They gave me
my first pair of gloves.

24:16.380 --> 24:18.882
Some gloves...
You know, smelly, ratty and...

24:18.916 --> 24:21.385
all tattered.

24:21.419 --> 24:23.287
They were mine.

24:23.321 --> 24:25.156
You know?

24:25.189 --> 24:27.558
You got your soul
in those gloves.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.593
Hey, hey, hey,

24:29.627 --> 24:31.662
- They gave me a home.
- Hector, chill out.

24:31.695 --> 24:34.565
Uh...
I met my boys.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.700
That whole table,

24:36.734 --> 24:39.037
- I would stay away from 'em if I was you.
- Billy!

24:39.070 --> 24:41.230
Behave yourself... there are
a lot of rich people here.

24:42.906 --> 24:44.208
Um...

24:44.242 --> 24:45.676
when I was...

24:45.709 --> 24:47.711
when I was...
when I was 12 years old,

24:47.745 --> 24:49.547
there was this little girl.

24:49.580 --> 24:53.451
She was skinny.
She had ratty hair.

24:53.484 --> 24:57.055
She had been through it.
She stuck with me

24:57.088 --> 25:01.125
when I was, uh, um...
was incarcerated.

25:01.159 --> 25:02.526
A couple times.

25:04.262 --> 25:08.032
And I knew she was there.
I wouldn't be here

25:08.066 --> 25:09.900
without my wife Maureen.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.712
Now, you, with your fancy cars

25:21.745 --> 25:23.581
and... or your fancy dresses

25:23.614 --> 25:26.384
and your-your fancy suits

25:26.417 --> 25:29.320
and your beautiful hair,

25:29.353 --> 25:30.954
take some of that money and...

25:30.988 --> 25:34.592
and give it, give it...
give us that shit.

25:34.625 --> 25:37.395
All right.

25:47.105 --> 25:49.973
Swagger? No, I got pizzazz.
That's a level above swagger.

25:50.007 --> 25:51.875
That's that new shit.

25:51.909 --> 25:53.811
Come on, everybody tired
of that old shit, man.

25:53.844 --> 25:56.214
Miguel, Miguel. Bitch boy.
Here he comes.

25:56.247 --> 25:57.915
Speaking of old shit.

25:57.948 --> 25:59.283
Watch this.

25:59.317 --> 26:00.784
Hey, Billy,
why you leaving so soon?

26:00.818 --> 26:03.121
Come on, baby, let's go.

26:03.154 --> 26:05.423
I hope you're not taking everything
personal. I'm just trying to sell a fight.

26:05.456 --> 26:07.858
- Get the fuck off me, man.
- Don't give him any press.

26:07.891 --> 26:10.027
What, I got to fuck your
bitch to talk to you?

26:10.060 --> 26:12.963
Billy, let that go. Come on, keep walking.
Come on. Let's go.

26:12.996 --> 26:15.566
How about this? I'll take your
bitch, then I'll take your belt.

26:15.599 --> 26:17.801
Just let it go.
Baby...

26:17.835 --> 26:19.837
- How about I take your belt...
- Let's go home.

26:19.870 --> 26:22.005
- ...then I take your bitch?
- Let it go. Baby.

26:22.039 --> 26:23.374
There he is. There he is.

26:23.407 --> 26:24.708
Let's go home.
Walk away.

26:24.742 --> 26:27.111
Stop it. Stop. Billy.

26:27.145 --> 26:29.747
- Billy...
- I'll take your belt, bitch.

26:29.780 --> 26:31.915
Billy!

26:31.949 --> 26:33.717
- Stop it! Stop!
- Get out of the way, Mo!

26:37.855 --> 26:40.224
Billy! Billy!

26:44.862 --> 26:46.564
Bitch-ass nigga!

26:49.967 --> 26:51.435
Billy, stop!

26:51.469 --> 26:53.237
Stop it!

26:54.772 --> 26:56.774
Fuckin' little bitch!

26:56.807 --> 26:59.009
Get the fuck off me!

26:59.042 --> 27:01.912
- I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.
- Bitch-ass motherfucker!

27:01.945 --> 27:04.515
It wasn't me, man!
He shot my...

27:06.550 --> 27:08.886
Huh? Huh?

27:08.919 --> 27:10.087
Billy?

27:10.120 --> 27:12.122
- Hey, hey. Hey, what's up?
- Billy?

27:12.156 --> 27:13.657
What's up, baby?

27:13.691 --> 27:15.859
What's wrong? What's wrong?

27:15.893 --> 27:17.661
- What?
- I don't know.

27:17.695 --> 27:19.297
- What happened?
- Something happened.

27:19.330 --> 27:21.632
Hey, I don't know what to do.

27:21.665 --> 27:23.634
- Am I okay?
- Yeah, yeah, you're okay.

27:23.667 --> 27:25.135
Fuck. Fuck, baby.

27:25.169 --> 27:28.071
Okay. Okay. What do I do?
Do I lie her down?

27:28.105 --> 27:30.107
Do I lie her down?
I don't know what to do.

27:30.140 --> 27:31.542
- Go get some help!
- Okay.

27:31.575 --> 27:33.744
Hey, call 911, man! Come on!

27:33.777 --> 27:35.946
Hey, hey, hey, hey...
It's okay, it's okay.

27:35.979 --> 27:38.081
- Hey, Jon Jon!
- No, baby, I don't want to lay down.

27:38.115 --> 27:40.083
- No, no, no, stay up...
- I don't want to lay down.

27:40.117 --> 27:42.453
Hector did that shit!
It wasn't me! Get off me!

27:42.486 --> 27:44.087
Hector, what the fuck
are you doing?!

27:44.121 --> 27:46.123
What are you fucking
thinking, man?!

27:46.156 --> 27:47.625
Get a doctor here!

27:47.658 --> 27:50.694
Get a fucking ambulance!

27:50.728 --> 27:52.296
Yeah? What's up?
What's up, baby?

27:52.330 --> 27:54.198

27:54.232 --> 27:56.467

27:56.500 --> 27:58.035
Baby, I want to go home.

27:58.068 --> 28:00.504
Okay, okay, okay.

Hey, look at me, look at me

Baby, look at me in the eye!

28:07.845 --> 28:10.047

28:10.080 --> 28:12.283
It's not that bad.

28:46.984 --> 28:49.353
There you go, baby,

28:49.387 --> 28:51.188
There you go.
Cradled in your arms.

28:52.690 --> 28:54.024
Wait, wait, wait.

28:54.057 --> 28:55.493
Hey. Hey.

28:55.526 --> 28:57.227
No, baby, baby, baby,

28:57.261 --> 29:00.464
Wait, no.
Look me in the eye, baby.

29:00.498 --> 29:03.534
Baby, baby, stay, stay, stay.

29:03.567 --> 29:05.669
Baby. Baby, stay, stay, stay.

Baby, no.

29:07.671 --> 29:09.373

29:09.407 --> 29:11.309
Wait, baby, wait.

29:16.747 --> 29:18.816
Shit...

29:18.849 --> 29:20.984
Is there a doctor here?

29:21.018 --> 29:22.219
Doctor?!

29:24.555 --> 29:26.590
We need a doctor!
We need a doctor!

29:40.237 --> 29:42.340
We're sorry
to hear about your loss.

29:42.373 --> 29:44.442
We're gonna try
to make this

29:44.475 --> 29:46.844
as, uh, simple and easy
as possible.

29:46.877 --> 29:49.447
We need an eyewitness
to identify the shooter.

29:49.480 --> 29:52.115
No one's talking or they don't
want to be involved.

29:52.149 --> 29:55.252
- Do you remember anything?
- What... what time is it?

29:55.285 --> 29:58.121
It's 6:00 a.m. We know it's
been a long night for you,

29:58.155 --> 29:59.857
but we got to ask
these questions.

29:59.890 --> 30:01.625
The housekeeper's there
with my, um,

30:01.659 --> 30:03.461
with my daughter, so I...
Can I just...?

30:03.494 --> 30:04.962
Uh, I can't find my phone.

30:04.995 --> 30:06.964
We just need another
moment of your time.

30:06.997 --> 30:09.933
Uh, one of your crew, uh,
had a weapon on him.

30:09.967 --> 30:11.869
He said he was
your security detail.

30:11.902 --> 30:14.304
Unfortunately, he didn't
have a permit to carry.

30:14.338 --> 30:16.540
My daughter wakes up at 6:00.

30:16.574 --> 30:18.376
Okay.

30:18.409 --> 30:20.544
I tell you what, Mr. Hope.

30:20.578 --> 30:22.580
Uh, if, uh,
you can remember

30:22.613 --> 30:24.748
anything, anything at all,
like we said, sir,

30:24.782 --> 30:26.817
don't hesitate
to give us a call.

30:26.850 --> 30:29.286
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. Hope.

31:55.272 --> 31:57.340
Hey, baby.

31:57.374 --> 31:58.909
You hungry or...?

31:58.942 --> 32:01.011
I-I could go down
to the kitchen

32:01.044 --> 32:02.546
- and get you something to eat.
- No.

32:02.580 --> 32:04.582
All right.

32:04.615 --> 32:06.784
Okay.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.089
Mommy leaves it on.

32:15.025 --> 32:16.494
Okay.

32:16.527 --> 32:17.761
Sorry, baby.

32:20.263 --> 32:22.265
Daddy...

32:22.299 --> 32:24.735
Yeah, baby?

32:28.405 --> 32:30.407
Never mind.

32:30.440 --> 32:33.744
Okay. Sleep tight.

33:17.354 --> 33:19.356
Lei.

33:19.389 --> 33:21.358
Come on, honey.

33:25.663 --> 33:27.731
It's gonna be all right.

33:27.765 --> 33:29.399
It's gonna be
all right. Here.

33:55.458 --> 33:58.095
- What the fuck are you doing here, man?
- Where you been, Billy?

33:58.128 --> 34:00.197
We been trying to get
in touch with you.

34:00.230 --> 34:02.566
Please, please, can you just

34:02.600 --> 34:05.769
- Please, let me, let me go with you.
- No.

34:05.803 --> 34:08.205
Just please talk to me
for two seconds, man, please.

34:08.237 --> 34:11.507
- What do you wanna talk about?
- Just whatever's going on in your head.

34:11.541 --> 34:14.911
I just... I just hope you're not
trying to do anything stupid

34:14.945 --> 34:16.679
like going after
Miguel or Hector.

34:16.714 --> 34:17.848
What do you wanna talk about?

34:17.880 --> 34:19.549
You wanna fucking talk now?

34:19.583 --> 34:21.918
Do you wanna fucking

34:21.952 --> 34:25.922
- Talk to me, you fucking pussy.
- Geez, I'm sorry!

34:25.956 --> 34:28.891
You were the one who's supposed
to fucking look after her.

34:28.926 --> 34:31.061
You were the one...

34:31.094 --> 34:33.996
- that was supposed to look after her, huh?
- I'm sorry for Mo.

34:34.031 --> 34:36.667
I'm sorry...
and for your little girl.

34:36.699 --> 34:38.068
Kid, no, no, no.

34:38.101 --> 34:39.902
Get the fuck

34:41.304 --> 34:43.273
Get the fuck out!

34:45.242 --> 34:47.577
Ain't fuckin' nothing

No good fucking piece of shit.

35:23.346 --> 35:25.115

35:25.148 --> 35:27.785
Hector ain't here.

35:27.818 --> 35:29.419
Open the door.

35:29.452 --> 35:31.054

35:56.146 --> 35:58.081
Where is he?
Is he out with Miguel?

35:58.115 --> 36:01.051
I don't know.
You think he tells me shit?

36:01.084 --> 36:03.721
Yo, you gonna give me

36:10.660 --> 36:12.129
That ain't money.

36:12.162 --> 36:13.931
Yo, you got a hit?

Where the fuck is he?

you've got a lot
of money going out.

37:31.108 --> 37:32.575
You know,
with the mortgage

37:32.609 --> 37:34.845
and your friend Gabe's
legal fees

37:34.878 --> 37:36.379
and all your taxes
are due,

37:36.413 --> 37:38.315
including your property taxes.

37:38.348 --> 37:40.317
Uh, it's, uh,
starting to add up.

37:40.350 --> 37:43.453
Um, a lot of these
are overdue.

37:43.486 --> 37:44.855
Months, in fact.

37:44.888 --> 37:47.590
So... pay them.

37:47.624 --> 37:50.327
- With what?
- With my fucking money, Simon.

37:50.360 --> 37:51.962
That's why I'm here, Billy.

37:51.995 --> 37:53.563
The money,
it's drying up.

37:53.596 --> 37:56.299
Look, you gotta see
what's happening here.

37:56.333 --> 37:58.201
Um, you need to cut back.

37:58.235 --> 37:59.970
I mean, they've already
taken two of the cars.

38:00.003 --> 38:03.440
- What's it about, man?
- It... it's real simple.

38:03.473 --> 38:05.809
What's it about,
you-you taking my money?

38:05.843 --> 38:07.277
What?

38:07.310 --> 38:10.280
- You stealing from me, Simon?
- No.

38:10.313 --> 38:12.950
I'm-I'm just here
to help out.

38:12.983 --> 38:15.185
- I can take care of this if you want me to.
- Please.

38:15.218 --> 38:17.420
This is fine.

38:17.454 --> 38:19.122
- You can give me that and...
- Okay.

38:19.156 --> 38:20.390
You can leave this with me.

38:20.423 --> 38:21.892
I'll take care of it.

38:21.925 --> 38:23.760
Okay.

38:26.696 --> 38:28.698
Billy, I just want to say
I'm really sorry.

38:28.731 --> 38:31.734
About everything.

38:33.971 --> 38:35.672
Hey, look, Billy.

38:35.705 --> 38:37.340
You need this.

38:37.374 --> 38:39.476
This solves all your problems.

38:39.509 --> 38:41.845
- What is that?
- It's the contract.

38:41.879 --> 38:44.714
To fight Turay.
Look, I'm not gonna pretend

38:44.747 --> 38:46.649
I... I know the pain
you're going through.

38:46.683 --> 38:48.451
But I do know for you
to get through it,

38:48.485 --> 38:50.153
you're gonna have
to get back in that ring.

38:50.187 --> 38:51.554
No, Mo doesn't want me
to sign that.

38:51.588 --> 38:53.390
No, Mo didn't want you
to sign it then.

38:53.423 --> 38:55.325
Now she would want you
to actually sign the contract.

38:55.358 --> 38:56.693
Why you say that?

38:56.726 --> 38:58.395
Billy, every time
I seen you fight,

38:58.428 --> 39:00.330
you climb in there alone.

39:00.363 --> 39:02.966
Every time you bled,
you bled your blood.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.801
When you sat down on that stool
and it felt like death

39:04.834 --> 39:07.037
and you thought you couldn't
get up, but you got up?

39:07.070 --> 39:08.872
You did that.

39:08.906 --> 39:11.975
You need to get back
to that.

39:12.009 --> 39:14.511
You want Leila to grow up
the way you grew up?

39:14.544 --> 39:17.380
You want her in the streets?

39:17.414 --> 39:19.449
It's a three-fight deal, Billy.

39:19.482 --> 39:21.451
Got to get back to doing
what we do, man.

39:21.484 --> 39:25.222
When you're in the ring, you're gonna
feel different. I'm telling you.

39:26.789 --> 39:29.259
It's not about
contracts, right?

39:30.293 --> 39:31.995
It's about family.

39:32.029 --> 39:33.669
I don't know what I'd do
without you, man.

39:33.696 --> 39:35.532
You ain't gotta worry
about that, man.

39:50.914 --> 39:53.650
Nobody would've
expected Kalil Turay

39:53.683 --> 39:57.854
to have his way throughout
the fight against Billy Hope.

39:57.887 --> 40:00.457
Billy, put them goddamn
hands up now!

40:00.490 --> 40:02.792
Hope fighting in the wake

40:02.825 --> 40:05.062
- of his wife's unexpected death.
- Get off that rope!

40:05.095 --> 40:06.763
No aggression...

40:06.796 --> 40:10.167
simply a will to continue
taking punishment...

40:10.200 --> 40:11.368
Get off them goddamn ropes!

40:11.401 --> 40:13.003
...and to allow Turay

40:13.036 --> 40:15.238
to pound him with both fists

40:15.272 --> 40:16.673
to the body and the head.

40:16.706 --> 40:19.076
Ending it, now!

40:19.109 --> 40:23.346
But it's been a bloodletting
from the first bell onward.

40:23.380 --> 40:26.516
Yes!

40:26.549 --> 40:28.885
Hope finally gets in a right hand.

40:28.918 --> 40:31.288
Those have been
few and far between.

40:31.321 --> 40:33.256
- By and large,
- Control your fighter!

40:33.290 --> 40:38.628
It was a beat-down by Kalil
Turay, who appears to have scored

40:38.661 --> 40:41.965
an upset victory
over Billy Hope

40:41.999 --> 40:44.901
and perhaps has put
the finishing touches

40:44.934 --> 40:46.769
on Hope's great career.

40:46.803 --> 40:49.506
Focus, you hear me?
Huh? Billy, listen to me, man.

40:49.539 --> 40:51.908
I'm not gonna watch this. I'm not
gonna watch this happen to you, man.

40:51.941 --> 40:53.610
I'm not gonna watch
this happen to us.

40:53.643 --> 40:55.278
Billy, if you don't
show me something here,

40:55.312 --> 40:56.713
I'm gonna call it.
That's it. You hear me?

40:56.746 --> 40:58.548
We're done.
Wake up, champ.

40:58.581 --> 41:00.850
Don't call it, man.
No, don't call it.

41:00.883 --> 41:02.619
What the fuck
are we doing here, huh?

41:02.652 --> 41:04.254
I gotta end
this shit, Billy.

41:04.287 --> 41:06.023
You hear me?

41:06.056 --> 41:08.291
I'm not gonna watch this shit
happen to you, man, all right?

41:08.325 --> 41:09.859
Remember when we were done,

41:09.892 --> 41:11.728
when we were done,
you used to fight?

41:11.761 --> 41:13.997
Like, get up, get up.
Let's go.

41:14.031 --> 41:15.932
Come on, champ.
Let's go.

41:17.667 --> 41:19.636
He keep looking
out the ring for Maureen.

41:19.669 --> 41:21.938
He's losing
his fucking mind, bro.

41:23.506 --> 41:25.008
Seconds out.

41:25.042 --> 41:26.443
This guy is done.

41:26.476 --> 41:28.211
He's not the champ anymore.
Finish him.

41:28.245 --> 41:31.114
Hands up. Fight back.
Focus. Come on.

41:31.148 --> 41:32.915
Corner ready?

41:59.876 --> 42:02.011
Get the damn hands up,
Billy! Now!

42:10.687 --> 42:12.655
Oh, man!

42:21.064 --> 42:24.267
Billy Hope has
refused to compete here tonight.

42:24.301 --> 42:25.902
...fuck you!

42:25.935 --> 42:29.172
Another giant shot from Turay

42:29.206 --> 42:31.108
and the referee
is gonna stop it.

42:31.141 --> 42:33.042
- It's gonna be the end of that.
- It's over.

42:33.076 --> 42:34.711
No, don't call it.
No, don't call it.

42:34.744 --> 42:36.479
- That's it, it's over.
- No...!

42:36.513 --> 42:38.481
And Hope headbutts the referee!

42:40.750 --> 42:44.020
A horrible moment
as a final postscript

42:44.053 --> 42:47.557
to what has been a horrible
night for Billy Hope,

42:47.590 --> 42:49.592
and a career which produced
so many thrills...

42:49.626 --> 42:52.962
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- ...and so much joyous glory,

42:52.995 --> 42:58.168
appears to have ended
ignominiously here tonight.

43:17.954 --> 43:19.689
Eli?

43:24.361 --> 43:25.895
Eli?

43:28.030 --> 43:29.699
Is Jordan here?

43:42.345 --> 43:44.681
Is anybody still here?

43:48.050 --> 43:50.487
You headbutt a referee, man.

43:50.520 --> 43:52.355
What the fuck kind of shit
was that, man?

43:52.389 --> 43:56.125
Broke his nose. Shattered his
motherfucking cheekbone.

43:56.159 --> 43:58.060
What got into you, man?

43:58.094 --> 44:01.164
We did the biggest deal
that we ever did, Billy,

44:01.198 --> 44:03.200
and you fucked it off, man.

44:03.233 --> 44:06.002
It'll be a year before your
suspension is up for review,

44:06.035 --> 44:08.705
which means zero income. The fine
for the assault on the referee

44:08.738 --> 44:10.907
will be in the six figures.
He's suing you

44:10.940 --> 44:13.075
for lost wages
and emotional trauma.

44:13.109 --> 44:15.478
They're freezing all your
bank accounts immediately,

44:15.512 --> 44:18.581
and to top that off the networks are
suing us for breach of contract, man.

44:18.615 --> 44:20.617
Listen...

44:20.650 --> 44:23.553
you're gonna have to sell the
house to cover the debt.

44:23.586 --> 44:27.190
No, I don't wanna sell the house, man.
I'm not selling the house.

44:27.224 --> 44:29.859
- That's Leila's home.
- You don't have a choice, Billy.

44:29.892 --> 44:32.762
If you don't, it's gonna
get repossessed anyway.

44:32.795 --> 44:34.731
- This is some serious shit.
- No, no, no.

44:34.764 --> 44:38.235
I'll just train with Eli and then
we'll get ready for the next fight.

44:38.268 --> 44:40.803
I'm not even sure trainers
will take you on right now.

44:40.837 --> 44:42.839
What? I don't need another trainer.
I can just use...

44:42.872 --> 44:45.174
Eli's working
with another fighter.

44:45.208 --> 44:47.910
- Who? Who is he? Who is he?
- Miguel Escobar.

44:47.944 --> 44:51.281
- Are you working with him, too?
- Yeah.

44:51.314 --> 44:53.816
Billy, you know if
it makes money, it makes sense.

44:55.752 --> 44:57.954
- Oh, you...
- It's just business, Billy.

44:57.987 --> 45:01.624
I know you miss Maureen.
I miss Maureen, too, man.

45:01.658 --> 45:04.661
Shit, if she was here, she'd
be disgusted with you, man.

45:04.694 --> 45:07.330
We need you to pull yourself together.
You need help, Billy.

45:07.364 --> 45:09.532
Don't talk about
my wife that way.

45:14.471 --> 45:15.705
I fucking quit.
Fuck you.

45:15.738 --> 45:17.374
Can't do this anymore, Billy.

45:17.407 --> 45:18.641
Fuck outta my way.

45:19.676 --> 45:22.579
Scatter like roaches.

45:24.447 --> 45:27.047
Y'all follow him, make sure he don't
break no shit on the way out.

45:32.121 --> 45:33.490
Just a bunch of roaches.

45:33.523 --> 45:36.025
Now I fuckin' wrote you off.

46:23.139 --> 46:25.875
Baby, let's go home.
Let's go home.

46:25.908 --> 46:29.546
Let it go.
Baby, baby, stop it... stop...

47:05.448 --> 47:07.417
I'm sorry.

47:11.120 --> 47:13.790
I'm sorry.

47:20.296 --> 47:22.298
Dad?

47:26.369 --> 47:28.438
Dad?

47:28.471 --> 47:30.873
Dad! Daddy!

47:30.907 --> 47:32.709
Daddy, what happened?

47:32.742 --> 47:35.044
Daddy! Daddy!

47:35.077 --> 47:38.214
Somebody help me!
Somebody!

47:38.247 --> 47:40.116
Mr. Hope,
what did you take, sir?

47:40.149 --> 47:43.986
What did you take, Mr. Hope?
What'd you take?

47:44.020 --> 47:46.989
What kind of medicine,
Mr. Hope? What did you take?

47:47.023 --> 47:49.459
Mr. Hope?
What did you take, sir?

47:49.492 --> 47:51.628
Leila...
Where's my baby?

47:51.661 --> 47:55.231
Your daughter's fine. She's the one who
called 911. You were in an accident.

47:55.264 --> 47:57.066
- There's people looking after her.
- Leila?

47:57.099 --> 47:59.936
No, no, no. No, no.
She needs me.

47:59.969 --> 48:01.904
We found you with
a loaded weapon, Mr. Hope,

48:01.938 --> 48:03.973
under the influence,
with a minor present.

48:04.006 --> 48:06.342
Where's my baby? Leila?

48:06.375 --> 48:09.879
Where's Leila?
I gotta get outta here.

48:09.912 --> 48:12.214
Your daughter's with Child Services.
They're looking after her right now.

48:12.248 --> 48:13.816
- No, no, no, no...
- Everything's okay.

48:13.850 --> 48:15.552
No, no, no. No!

48:15.585 --> 48:17.454
- They're looking after her.
- We just lost the IV.

48:17.487 --> 48:19.589
- Get him down. Get his legs.
- No, no, no, no!

48:19.622 --> 48:21.357
- No!
- You got him?

48:21.390 --> 48:23.025
Lay back for me, Mr. Hope.
You're gonna be just fine.

48:23.059 --> 48:24.994
- No!
- Come on, just breathe.

48:27.564 --> 48:30.066
- Lay back. Everything's all right.
- Breathe.

48:30.099 --> 48:31.834
Just... just chill out
for a second.

48:31.868 --> 48:33.736
You're gonna be okay,
Mr. Hope.

48:33.770 --> 48:35.271
Just take a deep breath for me.

48:35.304 --> 48:37.073
Gonna be fine, all right?

48:38.475 --> 48:40.109
Gonna be fine.

48:40.142 --> 48:42.344
You're gonna be fine, Mr. Hope.

48:42.378 --> 48:43.746
Just relax.

48:47.249 --> 48:49.185
Maureen... no...

48:49.218 --> 48:51.387
no... I was...

48:59.862 --> 49:01.163
Maureen...

49:12.875 --> 49:15.778
Okay, he wants his copies.
I'll provide that.

49:15.812 --> 49:17.780
I promise.
By day's end.

49:17.814 --> 49:19.716
- If it's okay with you.
- All right.

49:19.749 --> 49:22.284
What about
the, uh... this evidence?

49:22.318 --> 49:23.853
Daddy.

49:23.886 --> 49:27.023
- Baby!
- Sit down, Mr. Hope.

49:28.925 --> 49:30.459
I just want to hug my dad.

49:30.493 --> 49:32.461
Mr. Korman,
get your client, please.

49:32.495 --> 49:34.030
Sit down.
Sit down, Billy.

49:34.063 --> 49:36.499
Thank you.
We're ready to begin.

49:36.533 --> 49:38.868
The matter this morning
is provisional custody

49:38.901 --> 49:41.137
of Leila Rae Hope, a minor...

49:41.170 --> 49:43.906
- When can I get her out?
- Don't interrupt, Mr. Hope.

49:43.940 --> 49:47.009
The child has no other
family, is that right?

49:47.043 --> 49:50.146
Uh, no, Your Honor.
Uh, both my client

49:50.179 --> 49:52.181
and his wife came up
through the system.

49:52.214 --> 49:54.383
I see.
So that's why

49:54.416 --> 49:56.953
these circumstances are a little
bit more painful for you.

49:56.986 --> 49:59.756
I want my daughter back.
I'm her father.

49:59.789 --> 50:01.791
Unfortunately,
that's not enough.

50:03.159 --> 50:05.261
This court is aware of
the tragedy

50:05.294 --> 50:07.730
your family
has suffered, Mr. Hope.

50:07.764 --> 50:09.465
Nonetheless,
you have chosen

50:09.498 --> 50:12.334
to demonstrate alarming
and dangerous behaviors,

50:12.368 --> 50:14.837
while having
custody of your daughter.

50:14.871 --> 50:19.308
Loaded weapons,
alcohol, violence...

50:19.341 --> 50:22.579
Mr. Hope will follow a case plan
that the court has designed.

50:22.612 --> 50:25.447
Said plan will include
individual counseling,

50:25.481 --> 50:28.618
as well as sobriety
and anger management classes.

50:28.651 --> 50:33.522
And I order said child remanded into
the care of the Family Services,

50:33.556 --> 50:35.958
until which time
the father can demonstrate

50:35.992 --> 50:39.095
the abilities to perform duties
of a responsible parent.

50:39.128 --> 50:41.297
- What?
- Parties back in 30 days

50:41.330 --> 50:43.099
- 30 days?!
- ...for a progress hearing.

50:43.132 --> 50:45.001
What the fuck does that mean?
30 days?

50:45.034 --> 50:47.536
- Watch your language.
- 30 days is bullshit, man.

50:47.570 --> 50:49.338
- That's bullshit!
- I will find you in contempt.

50:49.371 --> 50:51.173
Please, please,
I don't want to...

50:51.207 --> 50:52.842
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.
- My last warning.

50:52.875 --> 50:54.644
I don't want to.
Please, Daddy!

50:54.677 --> 50:56.813
- Billy! Come on! Billy!
- Take the child out, please.

50:56.846 --> 50:58.214
Please, I want
to stay with you!

50:58.247 --> 51:01.017
Let me just give
my daughter a hug!

51:01.050 --> 51:02.619
No, no, no...

51:02.652 --> 51:04.721
Daddy! Please!

51:04.754 --> 51:07.489
- He wants to see his daughter!
- Please, Dad...

51:07.523 --> 51:09.926
- Daddy!
- That's not necessary.

51:09.959 --> 51:12.294
No! I want to live with you!

51:12.328 --> 51:13.763
Please!

51:13.796 --> 51:15.865
- Get down there.
- Daddy! Daddy!

51:15.898 --> 51:18.935
Mr. Hope, that's enough.
I will hold you in contempt.

51:45.494 --> 51:48.965
Everything goes to auction.

51:53.636 --> 51:56.372
Hey, Evan, help me out
with this, will you?

51:56.405 --> 52:00.076
That'll go inside
the truck, towards the back.

52:03.479 --> 52:06.448
- Auction's tomorrow.
- No, it's all going to auction.

52:06.482 --> 52:07.583
Sorry, champ.

53:04.506 --> 53:07.376
Yeah, it's just a house, yeah?

53:09.378 --> 53:13.049
Hey, yo, thanks for, uh...
thanks for taking me.

53:13.082 --> 53:14.751
No, Billy.

53:14.784 --> 53:17.053
You know, I-I can't
really pay you right now.

53:17.086 --> 53:20.757
Well, fuck you.

53:20.790 --> 53:22.124
No, I don't want
to get paid.

53:23.726 --> 53:26.863
No, I was never here
for money, you know that.

53:26.896 --> 53:28.798
Never.

53:28.831 --> 53:30.332
Hey, yo.

53:30.366 --> 53:32.001
Hmm?

53:34.971 --> 53:36.705
I'm sorry, Billy.

53:36.739 --> 53:38.908
Hey, hey, hey.

53:45.982 --> 53:48.317
- This the place?
- Yeah.

53:48.350 --> 53:50.452
You, uh, you want me
to come with you?

53:50.486 --> 53:52.254
No, man, no, no.

53:52.288 --> 53:54.356
I got to do this alone.

53:58.094 --> 54:00.997
- It's yours.
- No, man, I'm not taking that shit.

54:01.030 --> 54:02.799
- I'm re-gifting it.
- I'm not taking that shit.

54:02.832 --> 54:04.100
I don't want it.

54:04.133 --> 54:06.869
So, you stay safe,

54:06.903 --> 54:09.071
- all right?
- Yeah, you, too.

54:15.577 --> 54:17.079
Call me if you
need anything.

54:17.113 --> 54:18.580
Yeah, all right, I will.

54:18.614 --> 54:20.016
Yeah.

54:27.256 --> 54:29.225
- I'll be around!
- Hey, yo, Jon Jon,

54:29.258 --> 54:31.127
go say hi to Mikey
and Gabe, all right?

54:31.160 --> 54:32.694
- You got it.
- Hey.

55:22.111 --> 55:23.445
- That's Billy Hope.
- For real?

55:23.479 --> 55:24.947
I didn't know
Billy Hope...

55:27.316 --> 55:30.586
Boo! That's it. Good work.

55:30.619 --> 55:32.955
Hey, Hoppy, I want you
on the ropes.

55:32.989 --> 55:34.891
I already did that shit.

55:34.924 --> 55:37.393
What'd you say?

55:38.928 --> 55:40.396
Give me 50.

55:40.429 --> 55:42.464
- Hey, T?
- Yes?

55:42.498 --> 55:44.366
You work with him
on one of those mitts?

55:46.002 --> 55:47.303
Yo, T.

55:47.336 --> 55:49.238
That's Billy Hope
over there.

55:50.672 --> 55:52.708
Ramone, let's go!

56:09.358 --> 56:11.427
You Tick Wills?

56:11.460 --> 56:13.562
So, what brings Billy Hope...

56:13.595 --> 56:15.031
into my gym?

56:15.064 --> 56:18.534
I'm looking for a...
you know, a place to train.

56:18.567 --> 56:21.270
And, you know,

56:21.303 --> 56:23.739
I don't know,
may-maybe a...

56:23.772 --> 56:25.807
trainer?

56:27.376 --> 56:28.844
I don't train
pro fighters anymore.

56:28.877 --> 56:32.181
Well, currently,
I am not a pro fighter.

56:32.214 --> 56:33.916
Do you think
I don't know that?

56:36.885 --> 56:41.290
Does it say in there that they
took my kid away from me?

56:42.858 --> 56:45.394
- Yeah, it does.
- It's been... it's been

56:45.427 --> 56:48.597
kind of...
like a whole mess.

56:48.630 --> 56:51.433
I was, I-I-I,
I-I remember that Ni...

56:51.467 --> 56:54.370
that Night Train fight, you know
what I mean, and I remember...

56:54.403 --> 56:57.373
I remember that-that,
you know...

56:57.406 --> 57:00.009
that was one hell of a fight,
you know?

57:00.042 --> 57:02.044
You're one hell of a coach,
you know, and, uh...

57:02.078 --> 57:04.680
man, he won that fight.

57:04.713 --> 57:06.415
Excuse me,
but if I remember correctly...

57:06.448 --> 57:09.251
And I do remember...
You won the fight.

57:09.285 --> 57:11.520
You got the decision.
Don't you remember?

57:11.553 --> 57:13.855
Yeah, I won that fight. I think
Jordan Mains paid it off.

57:13.889 --> 57:16.025
- Anyway, y...
- Jordan Mains paid them off?

57:16.058 --> 57:19.395
Yeah, look, I don't know, man.
It's the fight game, you know?

57:19.428 --> 57:20.896
How you gonna come in here
and say something like that?

57:20.929 --> 57:23.732
I'm just saying
that's why I'm here.

57:23.765 --> 57:26.368
Night Train was the only
fighter that beat me.

57:26.402 --> 57:29.505
I know you were
his trainer, and...

57:29.538 --> 57:32.574
I don't know how you...
how you train, but...

57:32.608 --> 57:34.876
- So that's why I'm here.
- See, the thing is,

57:34.910 --> 57:37.446
you couldn't handle
the rules here, man.

57:37.479 --> 57:39.348
I can handle the rules, man,
I'll handle the rules.

57:39.381 --> 57:41.650
Believe me, I grew up in the system.
I can handle the rules.

57:41.683 --> 57:44.920
You saw that funny little kid had
to do 50 push-ups for swearing?

57:44.953 --> 57:47.156
- Yeah.
- That's one of the rules here.

57:47.189 --> 57:48.924
No drinking, no drugs,

57:48.957 --> 57:51.360
no playing around,
no being late, none of that.

57:51.393 --> 57:53.562
No problems, you know what I'm saying?
I don't need that here.

57:53.595 --> 57:55.431
It's my job
to protect these kids.

57:55.464 --> 57:57.566
I'm here to train them
so they can grow up

57:57.599 --> 57:59.601
to be men.
You ready to work?

57:59.635 --> 58:01.670
- Yeah, yeah. I'm ready to work.
- 'Cause the thing is,

58:01.703 --> 58:03.439
you're not gonna be able
to throw a punch,

58:03.472 --> 58:05.474
in or out of the ring,
until I tell you to.

58:05.507 --> 58:07.209
- Yeah, fuck it, I'm in.
- No swearing.

58:07.243 --> 58:08.577
Did I tell you no swearing?

58:08.610 --> 58:10.179
Did I tell you no swearing?

58:10.212 --> 58:11.380
No, no, no, I...
yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:11.413 --> 58:12.914
Yeah, no swearing.

58:12.948 --> 58:15.984
Boxing is not about this;
boxing's about this.

58:16.018 --> 58:17.986
Boxing is like a chess game.

58:18.020 --> 58:19.855
Yeah, all right, fuck,
let's... uh, yes.

58:19.888 --> 58:22.291
Uh, not, uh,
fu... not fuck. Yes.

58:22.324 --> 58:24.026
Whoa. Are you on drugs?

58:26.062 --> 58:27.396
Are you intoxicated?

58:27.429 --> 58:28.964
I'm good, man.
I'm-I'm straight.

58:33.935 --> 58:35.271
Did you see this?

58:35.304 --> 58:37.806
All right.

58:39.108 --> 58:40.876
All right.

58:40.909 --> 58:44.413
I also need a job.
Yeah, I need to...

58:44.446 --> 58:47.649
I need to prove to the court
that I can hold a job.

58:53.722 --> 58:55.557
I got a...

58:55.591 --> 58:58.026
a night man
who just had a stroke,

58:58.060 --> 59:01.330
and he was cleaning
this whole place up.

59:01.363 --> 59:03.099
You could do that,
you can get your fees,

59:03.132 --> 59:04.933
and you can
make yourself a little check.

59:04.966 --> 59:07.636
Wow, you want me to clean
your fuckin' toilets?

59:07.669 --> 59:09.871
- Just to clean the place.
- I'm supposed to clean up

59:09.905 --> 59:12.774
after these punks here?
Is that what you think of me?

59:12.808 --> 59:14.776
- But you need a job.
- Yo, come on, man,

59:14.810 --> 59:18.147
I'm not gonna clean your
fuckin' toilets. Come on.

59:18.180 --> 59:20.349
Do you need a job or not?

59:20.382 --> 59:22.751
Nah, fuck this. Nah.

59:32.928 --> 59:36.332
And rent...
First day of the month.

59:36.365 --> 59:37.999
Where's the light?

59:38.033 --> 59:40.336
- First day, one of the month.
- Okay.

59:40.369 --> 59:41.703
Okay, you pay rent? Huh?

59:41.737 --> 59:43.605
- Yeah.
- Down this way.

59:49.010 --> 59:51.847
Three keys...
This work, the other...

01:00:10.566 --> 01:00:12.568
I never thought I'd see

01:00:12.601 --> 01:00:15.070
one of these places
again, Billy.

01:00:16.505 --> 01:00:18.807
All right, man.

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.909
Hey, tell Leila
hi for me.

01:00:20.942 --> 01:00:23.078
Can I help you?

01:00:23.111 --> 01:00:24.946
My name is, uh, Billy Hope.

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:27.716
Um, Leila... I'm here to,
I'm here to see my daughter.

01:00:30.886 --> 01:00:32.554
All right,
so the court is requiring

01:00:32.588 --> 01:00:34.656
drug screening twice a week?

01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:38.059
And hair samples
once a month, right?

01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:40.996
If you fail or miss one,
then I have to report it.

01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:42.764
When can I see Leila?

01:00:42.798 --> 01:00:45.767
Once we go
through this form.

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:48.837
What is your current address?

01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:51.540
I'm staying at the Tassler
right now.

01:00:51.573 --> 01:00:53.141
I'm staying there
till I can find,

01:00:53.175 --> 01:00:55.544
you know, a better...
better place to stay.

01:00:55.577 --> 01:00:57.913
- You know, find a place of my own.
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:57.946 --> 01:00:59.781
And have you
secured employment yet?

01:00:59.815 --> 01:01:01.817
- Yeah.
- Where?

01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:04.686
- A gy... at the gym.
- The gym?

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.657
Wills Gym on 156th Street.

01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:10.292
And who gave you
that employment?

01:01:10.326 --> 01:01:12.561
I got it myself.

01:01:12.594 --> 01:01:14.162
But who gave you the job?

01:01:14.196 --> 01:01:17.433
- The owner of the gym.
- And his name is?

01:01:19.501 --> 01:01:21.136
Tick Wills.

01:01:21.169 --> 01:01:22.904
Does Tick Wills have a number
I could call?

01:01:22.938 --> 01:01:24.906
I don't know.
I don't have a phone.

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.242
I don't know.

01:01:26.275 --> 01:01:28.744
How much you get paid?

01:01:28.777 --> 01:01:31.647
We haven't discussed that
just yet.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.982
So you haven't started
the job yet?

01:01:34.015 --> 01:01:36.652
- Hmm?
- You haven't started the job yet?

01:01:36.685 --> 01:01:38.654
No, you just...
you-you just asked

01:01:38.687 --> 01:01:40.656
- if I secured... it...
- Yeah.

01:01:40.689 --> 01:01:42.458
And I tol...
I secured it.

01:01:42.491 --> 01:01:45.461
Have you taken drugs
or anything with alcohol today?

01:01:45.494 --> 01:01:47.796
No. I haven't slept
very well, though. No.

01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:49.265
You on any form of medication?

01:01:49.298 --> 01:01:50.799
I took some Advil.

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:53.101
You're gonna
write that down?

01:01:53.134 --> 01:01:55.837
- Mm-hmm.
- "He took some Advil.

01:01:55.871 --> 01:01:57.939
He can't see his kid."

01:01:57.973 --> 01:01:59.841
These are the questions
on the form.

01:01:59.875 --> 01:02:01.710
That's just the protocol
that we have to go through.

01:02:01.743 --> 01:02:04.045
- Go after the test.
- But I'm asking you,

01:02:04.079 --> 01:02:05.947
because we're
about to see Leila,

01:02:05.981 --> 01:02:08.016
so I want to know
what kind of shape you're in.

01:02:10.819 --> 01:02:13.221
I'm a fuckin' mess.

01:02:15.357 --> 01:02:17.626
When can I see my daughter?

01:02:17.659 --> 01:02:20.862
And you think I should let you see your
daughter when you're a fuckin' mess?

01:02:23.965 --> 01:02:27.536
If I see my daughter, I'll
feel a lot better, all right?

01:02:27.569 --> 01:02:29.505
Will she feel a lot better?

01:02:29.538 --> 01:02:31.273
- Yes.
- Do you feel

01:02:31.307 --> 01:02:33.642
in a fit state
to see your daughter today?

01:02:33.675 --> 01:02:35.711
You want to help me?
Is that what you want to do?

01:02:35.744 --> 01:02:37.946
- You want to help me?
- I want to help Leila.

01:02:39.715 --> 01:02:41.583
That's my first priority.

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:46.588
Hey.

01:02:46.622 --> 01:02:50.258
Hey, baby.

01:02:54.963 --> 01:02:56.097
Hey...

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:01.002
You okay?

01:03:02.871 --> 01:03:04.706
Can you give us a second?

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.208
Leila, would you be
comfortable with that?

01:03:07.242 --> 01:03:10.145
- If I stand right over there?
- Sure.

01:03:10.178 --> 01:03:12.113
Okay.

01:03:12.147 --> 01:03:13.682
All right.

01:03:13.715 --> 01:03:15.751
I'm just over here.

01:03:19.588 --> 01:03:20.889
What's wrong, baby?

01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:22.624
Did somebody touch you?

01:03:22.658 --> 01:03:24.025
- Somebody hurt you?
- No...

01:03:24.059 --> 01:03:25.927
- They put a hand on you?
- No.

01:03:25.961 --> 01:03:28.464
They put a hand on you, baby?
You can tell me.

01:03:28.497 --> 01:03:30.666
- Mm-mm.
- Leila...

01:03:30.699 --> 01:03:32.901
You talk to me?

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:35.303
There's nothing to say.

01:03:35.337 --> 01:03:37.105
You fucked up.

01:03:37.138 --> 01:03:39.207
Don't use that
language with me.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.077
Or what? You gonna
punish me or something?

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:44.446
Look, I know that you're
mad at me right now...

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.214
You don't know anything!

01:03:46.247 --> 01:03:48.717
- Hey, hey. Hey, wait, wait...
- Can I go outside now?

01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:50.018
Yes, you can.

01:03:50.051 --> 01:03:51.887
- Yes, you can.
- Leila...

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.822
- just talk to me.
- Come on, Talia, let's go.

01:03:53.855 --> 01:03:55.791
Come on, we got a
couple minutes, baby.

01:03:55.824 --> 01:03:57.459
Is that your dad?

01:03:57.493 --> 01:03:59.327
I don't know anymore.

01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:04.566
Leila, will you come...
Leila, will you come back?

01:04:15.844 --> 01:04:17.345
What you doing here?

01:04:18.747 --> 01:04:21.249
Could I buy you a beer?

01:04:23.485 --> 01:04:25.320
I don't drink.

01:04:29.658 --> 01:04:32.127
I'll take that job.

01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:07.395
Step forward...
Step forward...

01:05:07.429 --> 01:05:10.499
Step back.
Step back.

01:05:10.532 --> 01:05:12.233
Relax, relax, relax, relax.

01:05:12.267 --> 01:05:13.769
One, two.

01:05:13.802 --> 01:05:15.270
To the right.

01:05:16.337 --> 01:05:17.773
To the left.

01:05:17.806 --> 01:05:19.875
Don't cross your hands.

01:05:19.908 --> 01:05:22.978
Step forward...
Step back.

01:05:23.011 --> 01:05:26.815
- Step back.
- Can I get that for you, champ?

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:37.893
What's your name?

01:05:37.926 --> 01:05:40.996
- Hoppy.
- What's that from?

01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:43.932
My mom liked bunnies, so...

01:05:43.965 --> 01:05:46.802
...she named me Hoppy.

01:05:46.835 --> 01:05:48.970
Man, to think that...

01:05:49.004 --> 01:05:50.972
Billy "The Great"
would walk in here.

01:05:51.006 --> 01:05:53.542
Just trying to get
some work here, you know?

01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:56.177
Oh, yeah, sure thing.

01:05:56.211 --> 01:05:58.914
- No more.
- Can I get a picture with you later?

01:05:58.947 --> 01:06:01.216
Yeah, if you finish
tying my... tying my shit...

01:06:01.249 --> 01:06:05.654
Oh. I can't say "shit."

01:06:05.687 --> 01:06:08.990
Step forward. You're being
too hard on yourself, son.

01:06:09.024 --> 01:06:10.859
You can't learn everything
in one day.

01:06:10.892 --> 01:06:12.393
- Hear me?
- Yes, sir.

01:06:14.229 --> 01:06:16.498
All right?

01:06:16.532 --> 01:06:18.099
All right?

01:06:21.970 --> 01:06:24.272
Mr. Hope?

01:06:24.305 --> 01:06:26.942
Can I speak to you
for a moment, please?

01:06:26.975 --> 01:06:28.443
What's up?

01:06:29.978 --> 01:06:32.180
Yo, is Leila all right?

01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:36.785
Where's Leila?

01:06:38.987 --> 01:06:41.790
Uh, she doesn't want
to see you today.

01:06:41.823 --> 01:06:43.892
What do you mean?

01:06:43.925 --> 01:06:46.828
She doesn't want
to see you today.

01:06:46.862 --> 01:06:50.098
I'm sorry.

01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:53.101
But I think we're gonna have
to give her some space

01:06:53.134 --> 01:06:54.970
and respect her wishes.

01:06:57.673 --> 01:07:00.408
She said...
she-she said that?

01:07:00.441 --> 01:07:02.177
Yes, she did.

01:07:07.683 --> 01:07:10.752
...last night's
fight, Magic Escobar

01:07:10.786 --> 01:07:12.453
defeated Kalil Turay

01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:14.322
by knockout in the fourth round.

01:07:14.355 --> 01:07:17.325
An incredible knockout,
and Turay did not recover.

01:07:17.358 --> 01:07:20.495
Miguel is now the new WBC
Light Heavyweight Champion

01:07:20.528 --> 01:07:23.198
of the World,
a title once held by...

01:07:28.436 --> 01:07:30.305
Come on, marry me?

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:32.708
Okay, how about...
let me check my schedule.

01:07:32.741 --> 01:07:34.342
I'll get back to you.

01:07:34.375 --> 01:07:37.012
Hold my hand?

01:07:37.045 --> 01:07:39.981
- I'll be waiting for you.
- Uh-huh.

01:07:40.015 --> 01:07:41.817
What's up, man?

01:07:41.850 --> 01:07:44.485
Thought you said
you didn't drink.

01:07:44.519 --> 01:07:46.822
What, you think a man
can't pick up a new habit?

01:07:46.855 --> 01:07:48.824
What are you doing here, man?

01:07:48.857 --> 01:07:50.759
Seriously, this is my spot.

01:07:50.792 --> 01:07:52.193
Can I get a wa... a water?

01:07:52.227 --> 01:07:54.830
Drinking's a solitary sport.

01:07:54.863 --> 01:07:56.798
It's a solitary one.

01:07:56.832 --> 01:07:58.967
I'm just trying to...

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.669
I'm just trying
to connect here, man.

01:08:00.702 --> 01:08:03.972
- I just...
- I just didn't want to go home.

01:08:04.005 --> 01:08:06.041
300 square feet of...

01:08:06.074 --> 01:08:08.209
nothing, you know?

01:08:11.079 --> 01:08:13.148
You got plans?

01:08:13.181 --> 01:08:16.084
Uh, um, what you mean by that?

01:08:16.117 --> 01:08:19.720
You know what you're gonna do with all this
training that you think you so desperately need?

01:08:19.755 --> 01:08:21.389
What you gonna do with it?

01:08:21.421 --> 01:08:23.390
I'm gonna fight, and then
I'm gonna get my kid back.

01:08:23.424 --> 01:08:25.794
Then you're gonna end up
right back here?

01:08:25.827 --> 01:08:28.263
- What are you saying?
- What do you think got you here?

01:08:30.131 --> 01:08:32.367
Um, fuck...
some scumbag killed my wife.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:35.502
What do you think you did...
to be sitting here?

01:08:38.273 --> 01:08:39.573
Why...

01:08:39.607 --> 01:08:41.810
- did your wife get killed?
- Look, man,

01:08:41.843 --> 01:08:43.344
all due respect, you know,

01:08:43.377 --> 01:08:45.145
I haven't really gotten
much sleep, man.

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:46.648
- What are you try to ask me...
- What happened?

01:08:46.682 --> 01:08:48.483
I don't fucking...
I just told you...

01:08:48.515 --> 01:08:49.850
What did you do?!

01:08:49.885 --> 01:08:51.118
Why you keep asking me
that question?

01:08:51.152 --> 01:08:52.688
What happened?

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.423
- What happened?
- I just told you what happened.

01:08:55.456 --> 01:08:58.794
- Why?
- I can't tell you why. What do you mean, why?

01:08:58.827 --> 01:09:00.696
Never mind.

01:09:00.729 --> 01:09:03.363
You can't even hear
the question.

01:09:03.398 --> 01:09:05.701
Why are you laughing?
What, is this funny to you?

01:09:05.734 --> 01:09:07.535
Is that fucking funny to you?

01:09:07.568 --> 01:09:09.104
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:09:09.136 --> 01:09:10.638
Piece of shit.
Fuck you.

01:09:10.671 --> 01:09:12.340
You see that?
That's what this...

01:09:12.372 --> 01:09:13.774
that's why you here.

01:09:13.809 --> 01:09:15.343
That's why you here.

01:09:15.376 --> 01:09:18.279
- It's all good, Tick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:23.852 --> 01:09:25.754
Yo, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:27.956
- Hey, don't bring that shit back in here.
- I'm sorry.

01:09:27.988 --> 01:09:30.826
That's okay. We don't need...

01:09:30.859 --> 01:09:32.660
Nobody wants your money.

01:09:37.064 --> 01:09:39.167
What do you want, man?

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.102
I never really had any plans,
all right?

01:09:41.136 --> 01:09:43.138
My wife always made
the plans for me.

01:09:43.171 --> 01:09:45.874
And my daughter

01:09:45.907 --> 01:09:49.544
- Right.
- ...doesn't even want to see me right now.

01:09:54.449 --> 01:09:57.518
And I feel like
I broke her heart.

01:10:04.192 --> 01:10:07.695
Little kid, man,
she's a little girl.

01:10:07.729 --> 01:10:10.365
She's trying to take care
of herself.

01:10:12.367 --> 01:10:14.069
She lost her mother, too.

01:10:18.106 --> 01:10:19.775
Even if she hates you,

01:10:19.808 --> 01:10:21.642
you got to let her hate you,

01:10:21.676 --> 01:10:24.412
so she can feel better
about it, she can get better.

01:10:24.445 --> 01:10:26.281
This ain't
about how you feel.

01:10:26.314 --> 01:10:27.682
I mean,

01:10:27.715 --> 01:10:32.187
you got to let her go
through her thing

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:36.091
and not think that thing
is your thing.

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:41.229
Then you can deal

01:10:41.262 --> 01:10:45.700
with life, like that stuff.

01:10:45.733 --> 01:10:48.103
Life...

01:10:48.136 --> 01:10:50.305
boxing, whatever you want.

01:11:26.875 --> 01:11:28.143
Hey, come on. Come here, Hoppy.

01:11:28.176 --> 01:11:29.978
Let's go.

01:11:30.011 --> 01:11:31.612
Ready? Jab.

01:11:31.646 --> 01:11:33.148
Jab.

01:11:33.181 --> 01:11:34.816
Slow it down. Jab.

01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:36.084
Yeah, make it accurate.

01:11:37.185 --> 01:11:38.286
No pows, power, pop...

01:11:38.319 --> 01:11:40.188
No power, no power yet.

01:11:43.158 --> 01:11:44.459
What, what, what, what?

01:11:44.492 --> 01:11:46.895
What, what, what,
what, what? Jab.

01:11:46.928 --> 01:11:48.930
There you go. That's... Bam!

01:11:57.038 --> 01:11:58.673
Hey.

01:11:58.706 --> 01:12:00.475
Um... She...

01:12:00.508 --> 01:12:02.177
I don't wanna know...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:02.210 --> 01:12:04.112
I know. Um...

01:12:04.145 --> 01:12:05.380
She used to sleep with this.

01:12:05.413 --> 01:12:07.448
Would you give that to her?

01:12:07.482 --> 01:12:09.150
- Make sure she gets that?
- Yeah.

01:12:09.184 --> 01:12:11.252
I will.

01:12:11.286 --> 01:12:13.054
Tell her I love her.

01:12:28.069 --> 01:12:29.404
We start tomorrow.

01:12:29.437 --> 01:12:31.306
What, like training?

01:12:31.339 --> 01:12:33.841
No, baking cookies.

01:12:33.875 --> 01:12:36.177
I'm going to the bar.

01:12:36.211 --> 01:12:38.279
I do not want to see you there.

01:12:38.313 --> 01:12:40.248
Yeah, all right.

01:12:42.583 --> 01:12:44.219
A'ight.

01:12:46.121 --> 01:12:48.623
Shining so bright.

01:12:50.758 --> 01:12:53.294
The way you fight...

01:12:53.328 --> 01:12:55.130
anger's your biggest tool.

01:12:55.163 --> 01:12:58.233
Fighting angry, that drains you

01:12:58.266 --> 01:13:00.401
twice as fast.

01:13:03.838 --> 01:13:06.707
The other guy...
in the ring is your enemy,

01:13:06.741 --> 01:13:10.445
but if all you trying to do
is kill him,

01:13:10.478 --> 01:13:12.247
then you expose yourself.

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:14.749
You leave yourself vulnerable.

01:13:14.782 --> 01:13:16.684
Got to protect yourself.

01:13:16.717 --> 01:13:20.621
Make his mistakes...
be his destruction.

01:13:20.655 --> 01:13:23.224
Right now, you got two weapons:

01:13:23.258 --> 01:13:25.393
a shotgun and a grenade.

01:13:25.426 --> 01:13:28.229
All power, no precision.

01:13:28.263 --> 01:13:31.132
I want you to use
your other arsenal.

01:13:31.166 --> 01:13:32.733
There you go, tap.

01:13:32.767 --> 01:13:37.272
Tap, tap, tap, tap.

01:13:37.305 --> 01:13:39.207
There you go.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.775
One, two.

01:13:40.808 --> 01:13:42.410
Yeah... one, two, yeah.

01:13:42.443 --> 01:13:45.580
Pow, pow, yeah.
Pow, pow, yeah.

01:13:45.613 --> 01:13:46.614
Yeah.

01:13:47.715 --> 01:13:49.450
This is what we're gonna do.

01:13:51.186 --> 01:13:52.587
This is the wall, right here.

01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:55.290
My back's against the wall.

01:13:55.323 --> 01:13:58.359
It's part of the wall.
Blocking my chin.

01:13:58.393 --> 01:13:59.894
Huh? Shielding yourself.

01:13:59.927 --> 01:14:02.797
A block,
anything that comes that way.

01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:05.500
You're right here,
step and slide forward,

01:14:05.533 --> 01:14:07.735
roll...

01:14:07.768 --> 01:14:09.437
just step and slide.

01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:11.406
Forward, roll.

01:14:11.439 --> 01:14:13.975
This is the angle,
this is the angle.

01:14:14.009 --> 01:14:15.476
All right?

01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:16.644
Let's do it real slow.

01:14:16.677 --> 01:14:18.713
Take your time. Let's do it.

01:14:21.316 --> 01:14:23.951
My-my wife would've liked you.

01:14:25.186 --> 01:14:26.487
I appreciate that.

01:14:27.755 --> 01:14:29.290
Let's do this, all right?

01:14:29.324 --> 01:14:31.126
I'm serious.

01:14:38.866 --> 01:14:40.335
Good, looking good.

01:14:40.368 --> 01:14:42.270
Good, good.

01:14:42.303 --> 01:14:44.372
Good. Slide it.

01:14:44.405 --> 01:14:46.041
Yeah, I hear it now.

01:14:46.074 --> 01:14:47.342
Slide it.

01:14:47.375 --> 01:14:49.677
Oh, yeah, I hear it now.

01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:52.447
Step... step...

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:54.249
Who that is?

01:14:54.282 --> 01:14:56.217
See who that is...
There you go, aah!

01:14:56.251 --> 01:14:57.452
That's it. Jab.

01:14:57.485 --> 01:14:58.819
Who that hate?

01:14:58.853 --> 01:15:00.755
Who that hate?
Who that hate?

01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:02.257
Who that hate?

01:15:02.290 --> 01:15:04.059
Who that hate?
Who that hate?

01:15:04.092 --> 01:15:06.627
Drop your hands, Don't even
worry about punching right now.

01:15:06.661 --> 01:15:09.030
Just back against the wall.
Okay? You're doing good.

01:15:09.064 --> 01:15:10.331
You're doing good, all right?

01:15:11.432 --> 01:15:13.834
Back. See my back? Okay.

01:15:13.868 --> 01:15:16.037
Yeah, keep the back
against the wall.

01:15:16.071 --> 01:15:17.405
You feel that?

01:15:17.438 --> 01:15:18.539
Remember to slide.

01:15:18.573 --> 01:15:20.108
Keep making him miss...

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:21.776
Keep making him miss.

01:15:21.809 --> 01:15:23.778
I'm gonna
introduce you to something

01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:27.848
that you never knew before
called defense.

01:15:27.882 --> 01:15:29.417
- Hey, Ramone?
- Yes, Coach?

01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:31.752
- Come over here.
- I have defense.

01:15:31.786 --> 01:15:35.456
Stop punches with your face...
That's not defense.

01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:37.425
- I want you to spar with him.
- All right.

01:15:37.458 --> 01:15:40.027
- T! Glove him up.
- Like, spar with him?

01:15:40.061 --> 01:15:42.363
Don't worry. He's not gonna
be hitting anything.

01:15:42.397 --> 01:15:44.399
Wait, he's not gonna be hitting anything
or I'm not gonna be hitting anything?

01:15:44.432 --> 01:15:47.535
You're not gonna hit nothing.
You work on your defense.

01:15:47.568 --> 01:15:49.670
Like, don't hit anything?
Like with my glove?

01:15:49.704 --> 01:15:53.441
Don't touch him with your gloves.
Just block.

01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:57.312
Hey, champ.

01:15:58.979 --> 01:16:01.048
Move your feet,
move your feet.

01:16:01.082 --> 01:16:03.518
Come on, champ. You got to
turn your body when you block.

01:16:03.551 --> 01:16:06.387
You're just covering up.
Pivot out, pivot out.

01:16:06.421 --> 01:16:08.456
Step out, step out.

01:16:08.489 --> 01:16:10.291
Get some distance so
you can move your head.

01:16:10.325 --> 01:16:12.927
Don't just stand in front of him.
Use your feet.

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.895
Get off the rope.

01:16:14.929 --> 01:16:17.698
Come on, champ.

01:16:17.732 --> 01:16:20.501
Let's see you move.

01:16:22.337 --> 01:16:24.639
It's like fighting
a fucking gnat!

01:16:24.672 --> 01:16:26.607
Taking you out
like a boss, motherfucker.

01:16:26.641 --> 01:16:28.109
I heard that.

01:16:28.143 --> 01:16:30.010
And that's 50 for swearing.

01:16:37.352 --> 01:16:39.387
How you doing?

01:16:41.922 --> 01:16:43.958
- Hey, Leila.
- Hey, Talia.

01:16:47.928 --> 01:16:49.664
I need help.

01:16:56.704 --> 01:16:59.474
Lei, what happened
to your glasses, baby?

01:16:59.507 --> 01:17:01.942
They're not cool.

01:17:01.976 --> 01:17:03.378
Quiz me.

01:17:03.411 --> 01:17:05.746
I may need
the definitions, too.

01:17:13.288 --> 01:17:15.823
- Dismantle.
- Dismantle.

01:17:15.856 --> 01:17:17.024
D-I-S-

01:17:17.057 --> 01:17:18.859
M-A-N-T-L-E.

01:17:18.893 --> 01:17:20.961
You're so smart.

01:17:27.968 --> 01:17:30.471
- Hopelessness.
- Hopelessness.

01:17:30.505 --> 01:17:34.909
H-O-P-E-L-E-S-S-N-E-S-S.

01:17:34.942 --> 01:17:38.012
- Gra... gra...
- That's all.

01:17:48.423 --> 01:17:51.025
Although
I see there has been progress,

01:17:51.058 --> 01:17:53.994
unfortunately, Mr. Hope, legal
custody of the child shall remain

01:17:54.028 --> 01:17:57.198
with Family Services
until further evaluation.

01:17:57.232 --> 01:18:00.435
Court mandates that
your anger management program

01:18:00.468 --> 01:18:05.373
continue for another 30 days, and
visitation will still be supervised.

01:18:05.406 --> 01:18:07.742
30? Another 30,
another 30 days?

01:18:07.775 --> 01:18:10.144
Yes, Mr. Hope.

01:18:12.613 --> 01:18:14.749
You're free to go.

01:18:21.622 --> 01:18:23.758
It's too early for this.

01:18:29.864 --> 01:18:31.632
Just a sip.

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:37.538
What were you doing there
in the courtroom today?

01:18:37.572 --> 01:18:39.540
Take care
of some parking tickets.

01:18:39.574 --> 01:18:41.242
You don't have a car.

01:18:41.276 --> 01:18:43.077
Jaywalking.

01:18:47.181 --> 01:18:49.450
You all right?
How's your eye?

01:18:49.484 --> 01:18:50.918
Yeah.

01:18:50.951 --> 01:18:53.921
- How's your eye?
- Now you're being smart.

01:18:53.954 --> 01:18:55.790
No, seriously, what's up
with your eye? What is that?

01:18:55.823 --> 01:18:59.159
Evil blue-eyed devil
just took it from me.

01:18:59.193 --> 01:19:01.228
You know, the thing with you
is that, like,

01:19:01.262 --> 01:19:03.664
sometimes one eye is,
like, cloudy, right?

01:19:03.698 --> 01:19:05.633
And the other one is,
like, sunny.

01:19:05.666 --> 01:19:07.268
Like, cloudy, sunny,
cloudy, sunny.

01:19:07.302 --> 01:19:08.569
Close one eye, it's cloudy.

01:19:08.603 --> 01:19:09.970
Close the other eye,
it's sunny.

01:19:10.004 --> 01:19:11.672
I was fighting Buster Quigley.

01:19:11.706 --> 01:19:13.146
Buster Quigley was
a nothing fighter.

01:19:13.173 --> 01:19:14.975
We were in the
middle of a match,

01:19:15.009 --> 01:19:17.578
and I was crushing him,
knocking him to the ground.

01:19:17.612 --> 01:19:19.614
Out of nowhere, he hit me.

01:19:19.647 --> 01:19:21.482
Bam. With a right hand.

01:19:21.516 --> 01:19:23.284
I went down,

01:19:23.318 --> 01:19:25.686
my eye went dark.

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:29.324
Doc told me I could
never fight again.

01:19:29.357 --> 01:19:30.891
That's too bad.

01:19:30.925 --> 01:19:33.127
It was tough today in court.

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:34.962
With your kid.
Sorry about that.

01:19:34.995 --> 01:19:38.098
She doesn't want
to see me, anyway, so...

01:19:40.635 --> 01:19:43.338
Don't give up on your kid.

01:19:43.371 --> 01:19:47.375
Hey... that story
even true or is that...

01:19:47.408 --> 01:19:49.143
- It's a fake eye.
- Yeah?

01:19:49.176 --> 01:19:51.479
HMO screwed up,
sent me the wrong color.

01:19:51.512 --> 01:19:54.682
It's too much of a hassle
to get them to...

01:19:54.715 --> 01:19:56.751
give it back.

01:19:56.784 --> 01:19:59.554
I like that blue-eyed
devil story better.

01:20:01.722 --> 01:20:03.257
Yeah, me, too.

01:20:11.399 --> 01:20:13.067
Hope!

01:20:15.670 --> 01:20:17.338
What's up?

01:20:18.739 --> 01:20:20.708
- Give me that.
- Yeah.

01:20:20.741 --> 01:20:21.909
Yo, thanks, Hop.

01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:23.778
Be right back, Hop.

01:20:25.746 --> 01:20:27.882
What's up?

01:20:27.915 --> 01:20:30.685
Lou, uh, is working with
Keith "The Buzz Saw" Brady.

01:20:30.718 --> 01:20:32.520
Light heavyweight kid,
won the Golden Gloves.

01:20:32.553 --> 01:20:33.921
Yeah, yeah,
I know him, yeah.

01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:35.890
They're working
at Freddy's gym,

01:20:35.923 --> 01:20:37.725
and they're doing this,
uh, charity event

01:20:37.758 --> 01:20:39.894
for wounded veterans.

01:20:39.927 --> 01:20:42.530
And they want to know
if you want to go eight rounds,

01:20:42.563 --> 01:20:44.331
with Brady, for the cause.

01:20:44.365 --> 01:20:46.701
Yeah, we think that you'd bring
in a lot of people, big crowd.

01:20:46.734 --> 01:20:50.237
Raise a lot of money. It's your
opportunity if you want it, Billy.

01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:52.907
You don't need a license
to fight for a charity, so...

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:54.775
Good seeing you, Tick.

01:20:54.809 --> 01:20:56.310
- Let me know.
- Yeah.

01:20:56.343 --> 01:20:57.863
- Nice meeting you, Billy.
- All right.

01:21:03.384 --> 01:21:04.919
What do you think?

01:21:04.952 --> 01:21:06.521
It's got one condition.

01:21:06.554 --> 01:21:08.389
Better do
what we practiced here.

01:21:08.423 --> 01:21:10.124
That's all I ask.

01:21:10.157 --> 01:21:13.461
It is kind of nice
to be wanted, yeah?

01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:18.433
Hey, you know what? Um...

01:21:18.466 --> 01:21:21.402
- Yo, I'm worried about Hoppy.
- What you mean?

01:21:21.436 --> 01:21:24.238
He's been wearing the same set of
clothes for the past two days.

01:21:24.271 --> 01:21:27.442
He said something about his mom and
dad getting in a fight last night,

01:21:27.475 --> 01:21:29.744
and then his dad went out
after his mom left.

01:21:29.777 --> 01:21:31.278
- His mom left?
- Yeah.

01:21:37.051 --> 01:21:38.986
His mom having some struggles.

01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:40.888
You should find out
if he's got a place to stay.

01:21:40.921 --> 01:21:42.757
If he's out on the street,
then we can figure out

01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:44.692
where we can put him,
what we need to do, all right?

01:21:44.725 --> 01:21:46.326
All right.

01:21:51.365 --> 01:21:53.634
"Kodug"? Is that a word?

01:21:53.668 --> 01:21:55.503
I feel like I've heard
someone say, like, kodug.

01:21:55.536 --> 01:21:58.839
Or Kodug's like a country
or something like that.

01:21:58.873 --> 01:22:01.842
Can we just
get out of here?

01:22:01.876 --> 01:22:04.612
Baby, the, um...

01:22:04.645 --> 01:22:06.914
the judge, um...

01:22:06.947 --> 01:22:10.851
said it's gonna be
another month.

01:22:13.788 --> 01:22:15.923
I'm gonna fight again.

01:22:17.958 --> 01:22:21.462
- What?
- I mean, it's a charity thing, you know what I mean?

01:22:21.496 --> 01:22:23.798
It's not like a real,
like a professional fight.

01:22:23.831 --> 01:22:25.132
You know, it's an exhibition.

01:22:25.165 --> 01:22:28.503
Um, but, um...

01:22:28.536 --> 01:22:30.738
I'm gonna fight again.

01:22:30.771 --> 01:22:32.773
- Can I go?
- Now, you know Mommy

01:22:32.807 --> 01:22:34.509
didn't like you
watching the fights.

01:22:34.542 --> 01:22:36.110
Well, somebody has to be there.

01:22:36.143 --> 01:22:38.579
Yeah, baby,
I'll, I'll, I'll be okay.

01:22:38.613 --> 01:22:42.149
- But I want to go.
- I don't think I can work that out.

01:22:42.182 --> 01:22:44.384
Then-then you can't do it.

01:22:44.418 --> 01:22:46.521
Dad, you have to tell them
you can't do it.

01:22:46.554 --> 01:22:48.122
Leila, I got, I got to do it.

01:22:48.155 --> 01:22:50.157
No, you can't.
I have to be there, Dad.

01:22:50.190 --> 01:22:51.792
Baby, I am trying
to get you out, just...

01:22:51.826 --> 01:22:53.093
- When?
- Leila...

01:22:53.127 --> 01:22:54.795
- When?!
- Leila, I'm trying.

01:22:54.829 --> 01:22:56.230
When?!

01:23:01.769 --> 01:23:03.538
You...

01:23:03.571 --> 01:23:04.739
I hate you.

01:23:04.772 --> 01:23:06.607
I hate you!

01:23:06.641 --> 01:23:08.743
Why can't you just get me
out of this place?!

01:23:08.776 --> 01:23:10.110
- Leila...
- Why are you not...

01:23:10.144 --> 01:23:12.847
I can't. I can't right now.

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:14.549
- Baby, please.
- I don't trust you!

01:23:14.582 --> 01:23:16.216
Just trust me.
Come on, baby!

01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:18.318
You keep making promises,
and you don't mean them!

01:23:18.352 --> 01:23:20.120
- That's not true.
- Leila, just calm down.

01:23:20.154 --> 01:23:22.022
You should've been the one
that was killed.

01:23:22.056 --> 01:23:24.592
- You, not Mom!
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:23:24.625 --> 01:23:25.960
- You!
- Come with me.

01:23:25.993 --> 01:23:27.762
- Let's calm down.
- You! You!

01:23:27.795 --> 01:23:29.764
I hate you!

01:23:54.054 --> 01:23:55.823
Ooh, that defense
looking good, Billy!

01:24:05.265 --> 01:24:07.501
Nice! That's the way
to block! Way to block!

01:24:13.073 --> 01:24:14.593
Keep that distance,
keep that distance.

01:24:17.011 --> 01:24:18.445
Jab, jab, jab, jab...!

01:24:18.478 --> 01:24:19.747
Good!

01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:21.849
Keep moving.

01:24:27.187 --> 01:24:29.323
- He could last another round.
- You could be right.

01:24:30.825 --> 01:24:33.894
Time! Time.

01:24:33.928 --> 01:24:36.063
To your corners. Corners.

01:24:38.999 --> 01:24:42.269
Give me the towel,
give me the towel.

01:24:42.302 --> 01:24:44.138
His jabs aren't quitting.

01:24:44.171 --> 01:24:45.706
Keep your hands up, 'cause
you're dropping your hands.

01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:47.808
Just keep jabbing.
Keep jabbing.

01:24:47.842 --> 01:24:49.443
This round, this round...

01:24:49.476 --> 01:24:51.078
I need you to be
a little more aggressive, okay?

01:24:51.111 --> 01:24:52.747
Just for points, not for blood.

01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:55.315
Keep your calm.
Tap, tap, tap.

01:24:56.851 --> 01:24:57.918
Seconds out.

01:24:57.952 --> 01:25:00.220
Let's go, let's go.

01:25:05.025 --> 01:25:06.326
Go the distance.

01:25:11.699 --> 01:25:13.033
Box!

01:25:17.838 --> 01:25:19.740
Keep your head moving.

01:25:19.774 --> 01:25:21.575
Move the body!
Way to move the body!

01:25:21.608 --> 01:25:22.688
There you go, there you go.

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.014
That's it!

01:25:28.983 --> 01:25:30.985
- Keep jabbing!
- Go!

01:25:33.921 --> 01:25:35.555
There you go!

01:25:35.589 --> 01:25:36.991
That's it!

01:25:38.558 --> 01:25:39.894
Jab, jab, jab, jab!

01:25:42.096 --> 01:25:43.856
Keep moving!

01:25:45.199 --> 01:25:46.466
Just jab, just jab!

01:26:01.581 --> 01:26:02.917
That's it!

01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:04.518
- Way to go! Way to go!
- Damn!

01:26:07.087 --> 01:26:09.389
Three! Four!

01:26:09.423 --> 01:26:11.558
Five! Six!

01:26:11.591 --> 01:26:13.393
Seven!

01:26:13.427 --> 01:26:15.763
- Eight! Nine!
- Way to go, baby!

01:26:15.796 --> 01:26:17.097
Ten!

01:26:17.131 --> 01:26:18.933
That's it!

01:26:21.769 --> 01:26:24.171
Yeah, Billy!

01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:28.308
All right, will you just
tell her that I called

01:26:28.342 --> 01:26:31.078
and that, uh,
tell Leila I'm okay,

01:26:31.111 --> 01:26:33.848
and Daddy won.

01:26:33.881 --> 01:26:35.182
Yeah, oh, thanks, yeah.

01:26:35.215 --> 01:26:38.118
Yeah, thank you.

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:41.722
Beautiful.

01:26:41.756 --> 01:26:43.557
Beautiful fight, man.

01:26:45.893 --> 01:26:47.762
Beautiful fight, man.

01:26:47.795 --> 01:26:50.530
You looked great,
like a whole 'nother fighter.

01:26:50.564 --> 01:26:52.266
Yeah, thanks.

01:26:53.567 --> 01:26:55.635
Can I talk to you?

01:26:58.906 --> 01:27:00.875
What do you want to talk about?

01:27:00.908 --> 01:27:02.376
I came to see you, man.

01:27:02.409 --> 01:27:04.912
Well, you should
be looking at Brady.

01:27:04.945 --> 01:27:08.949
You know me, I like to stick
with the sure thing.

01:27:08.983 --> 01:27:11.251
Congratulations
on that title fight.

01:27:11.285 --> 01:27:13.387
I heard Miguel didn't have
a hard time with Turay.

01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:15.555
How'd you like to fight
for that title?

01:27:15.589 --> 01:27:18.058
Yeah, cut the bullshit,
all right?

01:27:18.092 --> 01:27:21.528
Look, you needed some time off. Now
it's time to get you back on top.

01:27:21.561 --> 01:27:24.799
- What are you saying?
- I got some friends down at the FAC.

01:27:24.832 --> 01:27:27.835
They owe me some favors. I think
I can get you a early review,

01:27:27.868 --> 01:27:29.603
get your license back.

01:27:29.636 --> 01:27:31.705
The changes you've made in
the past couple of months,

01:27:31.738 --> 01:27:34.041
I think the changes
speak for themselves.

01:27:35.175 --> 01:27:36.911
What's the plan?

01:27:36.944 --> 01:27:39.146
Vegas, six weeks.

01:27:39.179 --> 01:27:41.315
It's a big one.

01:27:43.884 --> 01:27:45.085
Hey, Tick.

01:27:45.119 --> 01:27:46.486
Jordan.

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.088
You did a great job
with your fighter.

01:27:48.122 --> 01:27:49.556
He works hard.

01:27:49.589 --> 01:27:51.926
Coach, I'm gonna
put this stuff in the van.

01:27:51.959 --> 01:27:53.260
- Yeah, thanks, Jon.
- Yeah.

01:27:53.293 --> 01:27:55.229
It's a great opportunity, Billy.

01:27:55.262 --> 01:27:57.331
I'll be in touch.

01:28:02.202 --> 01:28:04.138
What's that about?

01:28:04.171 --> 01:28:06.373
Title shot, Vegas, six weeks.

01:28:06.406 --> 01:28:08.142
Really?

01:28:08.175 --> 01:28:09.944
Six weeks?

01:28:09.977 --> 01:28:11.278
You know what
that's about, right?

01:28:11.311 --> 01:28:13.547
- Yeah.
- He's gonna sell it

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:16.550
like it's a-a revenge match
around the murder of your wife.

01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:19.719
Yeah, it'll all be about Mo.

01:28:19.753 --> 01:28:21.121
You're not considering it?

01:28:21.155 --> 01:28:22.857
Yeah.

01:28:22.890 --> 01:28:26.160
I got to make some money, man.

01:28:26.193 --> 01:28:28.695
I can't lose my girl.

01:28:28.728 --> 01:28:30.998
This man right here...
You fell down to the ground,

01:28:31.031 --> 01:28:32.566
he just stepped right over you.

01:28:32.599 --> 01:28:34.301
He fixes fights.

01:28:34.334 --> 01:28:35.836
He's a liar.

01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:37.304
Yeah, look, I'm not
talking about him.

01:28:37.337 --> 01:28:38.538
I'm talking about you.

01:28:38.572 --> 01:28:40.975
I can't do this without you.

01:28:41.008 --> 01:28:42.776
I can't do this with you.

01:28:42.809 --> 01:28:44.945
Why?

01:28:44.979 --> 01:28:46.613
I don't train pro fighters.

01:28:46.646 --> 01:28:48.849
What, you're saying to me
that someone came in

01:28:48.883 --> 01:28:51.323
and offered the boys a pro shot,
you wouldn't give it to them?

01:28:53.988 --> 01:28:56.857
All I need is the six weeks.

01:28:56.891 --> 01:28:59.093
I need six weeks.

01:28:59.126 --> 01:29:01.028
I'll give you my everything.

01:29:01.061 --> 01:29:03.297
You get my everything.

01:29:03.330 --> 01:29:05.399
This is about my family.

01:29:09.169 --> 01:29:11.571
I can't lose my daughter.

01:29:16.977 --> 01:29:18.312
Tick?

01:29:19.746 --> 01:29:22.416
I got nothing
to say to you, man.

01:29:52.112 --> 01:29:53.413
Tick.

01:29:55.215 --> 01:29:56.550
Who's winning?

01:30:04.891 --> 01:30:07.527
You know Hoppy died?

01:30:08.862 --> 01:30:10.264
What?

01:30:10.297 --> 01:30:12.132
He tried to protect his mom,

01:30:12.166 --> 01:30:14.168
and his dad shot him.

01:30:14.201 --> 01:30:16.236
He's dead.

01:30:42.929 --> 01:30:44.364
I should've known.

01:30:44.398 --> 01:30:46.466
When you told me
that his mom left,

01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:48.902
I should've known right then.

01:30:52.839 --> 01:30:56.210
You're supposed to be able
to protect them, you know?

01:30:56.243 --> 01:30:58.712
These kids coming up in here,

01:30:58.745 --> 01:31:01.415
I'm telling them a bunch
of stuff that's bullshit.

01:31:01.448 --> 01:31:03.183
It's bullshit.

01:31:03.217 --> 01:31:05.019
"It's gonna be all right."

01:31:05.052 --> 01:31:06.886
"You can control your destiny."

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:10.424
"You could control this,
you could control that."

01:31:10.457 --> 01:31:12.826
You can't control shit.

01:31:12.859 --> 01:31:14.494
What the fuck, man?

01:31:18.965 --> 01:31:21.801
The fuck?

01:31:21.835 --> 01:31:24.504
What is this?

01:31:24.538 --> 01:31:27.474
What kind of,
what kind of shit is this?

01:31:31.445 --> 01:31:33.880
God must have some kind of plan

01:31:33.913 --> 01:31:36.516
to teach me

01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:38.685
some kind of lesson.

01:31:38.718 --> 01:31:40.920
I just can't figure out
what it is.

01:31:49.963 --> 01:31:51.898
You know what Hoppy told me?

01:31:51.931 --> 01:31:56.936
- Hmm?
- "You're a dream crusher."

01:31:56.970 --> 01:31:58.638
Uh...

01:31:58.672 --> 01:32:00.440
it's like, it's like, when, uh,

01:32:00.474 --> 01:32:03.577
one of them, one of them-them
games they play.

01:32:03.610 --> 01:32:06.146
I-I'm the Dream Crusher.

01:32:12.419 --> 01:32:15.289
That's like, you know,

01:32:15.322 --> 01:32:17.091
crazy stuff, right?

01:32:18.892 --> 01:32:21.828
So maybe I'm supposed to learn
how not to be a dream crusher.

01:32:21.861 --> 01:32:24.264
You know what I'm saying?

01:32:24.298 --> 01:32:27.701
Why stop now?

01:32:29.569 --> 01:32:33.173
You think that you can, uh...

01:32:33.207 --> 01:32:35.975
beat Magic?

01:32:36.009 --> 01:32:38.044
No.

01:32:38.078 --> 01:32:39.879
I can't beat him.

01:32:39.913 --> 01:32:41.681
Not without you.

01:32:41.715 --> 01:32:44.151
Promise me something.

01:32:44.184 --> 01:32:46.853
- Mm-hmm.
- Whatever happens,

01:32:46.886 --> 01:32:48.755
you'll still keep
taking care of yourself,

01:32:48.788 --> 01:32:51.358
and you'll take care
of your daughter.

01:32:53.026 --> 01:32:54.828
Mr. Hope,

01:32:54.861 --> 01:32:56.996
after careful review
of your file,

01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:59.466
including the assessment
from your case worker,

01:32:59.499 --> 01:33:02.402
I'm gonna remove
the visitation restrictions,

01:33:02.436 --> 01:33:04.871
and the reunification
can begin next week.

01:33:04.904 --> 01:33:08.142
You attorney will receive
notification in the mail.

01:33:08.175 --> 01:33:10.043
Good job, Mr. Hope.

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:16.049
Thank you.

01:33:24.124 --> 01:33:27.227
- You have new shoes?
- No, I've had these.

01:33:27.261 --> 01:33:28.862
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:33:28.895 --> 01:33:31.498
Baby, I don't remember
those shoes. Remember...

01:33:31.531 --> 01:33:34.368
I don't have that much food here,
baby, but I can make you an egg.

01:33:34.401 --> 01:33:35.735
You want an egg?

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:43.009
No, why aren't you eating?
What's wrong, baby?

01:33:43.042 --> 01:33:45.812
- Why didn't you eat anything?
- You think I'm a baby.

01:33:45.845 --> 01:33:49.283
- I don't think you're a baby.
- Then how come you won't let me come?

01:33:49.316 --> 01:33:52.152
Look, 'cause I told you,
I told you it wasn't up to me.

01:33:52.186 --> 01:33:54.554
Well, it's up to you now.

01:33:58.558 --> 01:34:01.961
Look, when Mom,
when Mom was... you...

01:34:05.064 --> 01:34:06.933
...around, you know,

01:34:06.966 --> 01:34:10.404
she was the one who always made
all the decisions, you know?

01:34:10.437 --> 01:34:13.106
For you, for me,
and...

01:34:14.841 --> 01:34:18.445
me, I can't
make them, you know?

01:34:18.478 --> 01:34:20.714
Not so much.

01:34:20.747 --> 01:34:22.649
I know.

01:34:22.682 --> 01:34:25.151
What do you know?

01:34:25.185 --> 01:34:28.622
Mom always said
we had to take care of you.

01:34:32.559 --> 01:34:35.595
No, baby, that's not how
it's supposed to work.

01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:37.597
All right? I'm supposed
to take care of you.

01:34:37.631 --> 01:34:40.200
But the truth is,
I'm hanging on

01:34:40.234 --> 01:34:41.968
by a thread here.

01:34:47.641 --> 01:34:49.476
You sure you don't want
to eat something?

01:34:49.509 --> 01:34:51.177
Just, just...

01:34:51.211 --> 01:34:52.712
No, Dad.

01:34:58.418 --> 01:35:01.120
Can we go see her?

01:35:30.650 --> 01:35:32.686
I miss you a lot, Mom.

01:35:43.129 --> 01:35:45.265
More-more than ever.

01:36:04.451 --> 01:36:06.219
Hey.

01:36:07.721 --> 01:36:09.456
The guy that I'm fighting,

01:36:09.489 --> 01:36:12.892
he's the guy from the hotel
when-when Mommy was killed.

01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:15.929
Okay?

01:36:15.962 --> 01:36:18.298
They're gonna say
a lot of crazy things.

01:36:18.332 --> 01:36:21.267
All right?

01:36:21.301 --> 01:36:23.269
I have to be there.

01:36:23.303 --> 01:36:25.672
It's gonna scare you.

01:36:25.705 --> 01:36:28.942
Did Mommy get scared?

01:36:31.311 --> 01:36:33.447
All the time.

01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:35.615
Okay.

01:36:36.783 --> 01:36:38.852
I'll wait in the dressing room.

01:36:38.885 --> 01:36:41.555
But I have to be there.

01:36:48.362 --> 01:36:51.064
Okay, you got a deal, baby.

01:37:22.796 --> 01:37:24.230
You can do this.
You're stronger than that.

01:37:24.263 --> 01:37:26.966
They say Billy Hope
can't make it.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.035
They say Billy Hope is over.

01:37:29.068 --> 01:37:31.905
You!
You define yourself.

01:37:48.221 --> 01:37:49.989
I want you to
switch and go southpaw.

01:37:50.023 --> 01:37:52.091
Have the foot
move through with you.

01:37:52.125 --> 01:37:55.061
Same time... it's like
it's connected by a string.

01:37:55.094 --> 01:37:56.796
Same time that leg's
moving with that hand.

01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:58.632
See how it's coming
at the same time?

01:37:58.665 --> 01:38:01.067
You switch, then the right foot
has to land with a hook.

01:38:03.503 --> 01:38:06.806
Do what you gotta do,
to do what you want to do.

01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:08.374
That's Magic.

01:38:14.914 --> 01:38:17.350
Time, time.
I need to see the shuttle.

01:38:17.383 --> 01:38:19.352
- Shuttle? All right.
- I need to see the pivot.

01:38:30.764 --> 01:38:32.432
Time!

01:38:48.414 --> 01:38:50.884
Come on!

01:39:21.615 --> 01:39:24.518
Hello again, I'm Jim Lampley,

01:39:24.551 --> 01:39:27.220
along with the pound-for-pound
king of the '90s, Roy Jones,

01:39:27.253 --> 01:39:29.388
here in Las Vegas
at Caesar's Palace...

01:39:29.422 --> 01:39:31.858
as we welcome you live
to our coverage

01:39:31.891 --> 01:39:33.993
of the Light Heavyweight
Title showdown

01:39:34.027 --> 01:39:37.463
between existing titlist
Miguel Escobar

01:39:37.497 --> 01:39:39.499
and former champion Billy Hope.

01:39:39.533 --> 01:39:42.168
Roy, throughout the boxing
world, there's hope...

01:39:42.201 --> 01:39:44.170
You can't avoid saying it...

01:39:44.203 --> 01:39:47.774
That this evening could produce
a great story

01:39:47.807 --> 01:39:51.344
of redemption for Billy Hope, who's been
through so much, but realistically,

01:39:51.377 --> 01:39:54.380
what chance is there that Hope
could come back and win

01:39:54.413 --> 01:39:56.616
against such a skilled
and effective

01:39:56.650 --> 01:39:58.351
young champion as Escobar?

01:39:58.384 --> 01:40:00.353
The cards
are stacked against Hope.

01:40:00.386 --> 01:40:02.455
Um, his age, um,
the fact that he's been off,

01:40:02.488 --> 01:40:05.258
and this guy is probably
the best fighter

01:40:05.291 --> 01:40:07.493
that will ever be put
in front of Hope.

01:40:15.802 --> 01:40:17.871
Billy Hope, entering first,

01:40:17.904 --> 01:40:20.540
with no entry music,

01:40:20.574 --> 01:40:25.244
flanked by his new trainer,
Tick Wills.

01:40:25.278 --> 01:40:27.614
The ultimate revenge motive
for Hope tonight,

01:40:27.647 --> 01:40:29.749
'cause his heart, he believes

01:40:29.783 --> 01:40:32.919
he's avenging the death of
his wife in a bizarre incident

01:40:32.952 --> 01:40:34.888
in which Escobar was involved,

01:40:34.921 --> 01:40:38.091
an incident for which no perpetrator
has ever paid the price.

01:40:38.124 --> 01:40:41.360
What about the
choice of walking with no music, Roy?

01:40:41.394 --> 01:40:44.297
Anytime you've got
a crowd of this magnitude

01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:46.866
and so much energy
in one building,

01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:48.902
really, you don't need music.

01:40:48.935 --> 01:40:51.671
Billy Hope, in the
six-week build-up to this fight,

01:40:51.705 --> 01:40:54.173
has kept saying,
"All business, all business.

01:40:54.207 --> 01:40:56.242
"This isn't about
all that other stuff.

01:40:56.275 --> 01:40:58.645
It's just about
we're going to fight."

01:41:05.218 --> 01:41:06.953
...the king of kings!

01:41:06.986 --> 01:41:08.855
And here comes Miguel Escobar.

01:41:08.888 --> 01:41:12.358
Escobar is a product
of Colombia.

01:41:16.495 --> 01:41:19.933
In the past, Roy Jones, when we
spoke about fighters from Colombia,

01:41:19.966 --> 01:41:24.904
almost always, they were big punchers.
This is a different story.

01:41:24.938 --> 01:41:26.940
Yeah, this is
a whole different story.

01:41:26.973 --> 01:41:28.908
Not often do we talk about
Colombian fighters

01:41:28.942 --> 01:41:30.644
and talk about
the full package.

01:41:30.677 --> 01:41:32.545
Most of them come
with an astronomical amount

01:41:32.578 --> 01:41:35.448
of punching power,
but not skills to match that.

01:41:35.481 --> 01:41:38.417
Tonight we have a guy
who is just as good

01:41:38.451 --> 01:41:41.087
offensively, skill-wise,
as he is powerful.

01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:44.023
I said, more recently,
Sergio Martinez,

01:41:44.057 --> 01:41:46.159
but Carlos Melzon was a beast,

01:41:46.192 --> 01:41:48.361
but this kid
is a boxer-puncher

01:41:48.394 --> 01:41:51.698
with great speed, great power...
Something to see, Jim.

01:41:51.731 --> 01:41:53.166
He's no champ!

01:41:53.199 --> 01:41:55.334
And Escobar now promoted

01:41:55.368 --> 01:41:56.770
by Jordan Mains,

01:41:56.803 --> 01:42:01.540
the man who architected
Billy Hope's career.

01:42:05.444 --> 01:42:06.946
You have a good fight.

01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:09.615
I only gave him
six weeks to train.

01:42:11.851 --> 01:42:13.252
- Jon Jon?
- Yeah?

01:42:13.286 --> 01:42:15.188
Slip it off.

01:42:15.221 --> 01:42:18.191
You don't have to watch it if
you don't want to. You okay?

01:42:18.224 --> 01:42:20.393
And if the defection

01:42:20.426 --> 01:42:23.296
of Jordan Mains weren't enough,
Hope's longtime trainer,

01:42:23.329 --> 01:42:27.600
Eli Frost, trains Escobar
against him tonight.

01:42:27.633 --> 01:42:30.336
Okay,
gentlemen, you both received

01:42:30.369 --> 01:42:32.371
your instructions
in the dressing room.

01:42:32.405 --> 01:42:34.808
Okay, I want
a good, clean fight.

01:42:34.841 --> 01:42:36.609
Obey my commands at all times.

01:42:36.642 --> 01:42:38.945
Above all,
protect yourself at all times.

01:42:38.978 --> 01:42:41.080
Let's go.

01:42:41.114 --> 01:42:43.149
Tony Weeks says

01:42:43.182 --> 01:42:45.118
he wants a good, clean fight.

01:42:45.151 --> 01:42:47.353
Quite a number
of ring observers

01:42:47.386 --> 01:42:50.890
expect that's the last thing we
have any chance of seeing here,

01:42:50.924 --> 01:42:54.093
given the rising tide
of emotions

01:42:54.127 --> 01:42:57.363
in both corners
as round one begins.

01:42:57.396 --> 01:42:59.632
- You begin!
- Logic tells you

01:42:59.665 --> 01:43:02.101
that in the casting
of this fight,

01:43:02.135 --> 01:43:05.038
Escobar is the superior boxer,

01:43:05.071 --> 01:43:08.407
Billy Hope
the more physical brawler.

01:43:08.441 --> 01:43:10.043
You have to make him miss!
Make him miss!

01:43:10.076 --> 01:43:11.878
Come on, son!

01:43:11.911 --> 01:43:14.480
And early on,
Escobar getting off,

01:43:14.513 --> 01:43:17.550
but Hope comes back.

01:43:17.583 --> 01:43:19.452
Go to body shots! Go to
the body! Go to the body!

01:43:19.485 --> 01:43:21.988
Come on! Apply that pressure!

01:43:22.021 --> 01:43:23.456
Put it on him now!

01:43:23.489 --> 01:43:26.259
Escobar with the showboat.
Look at him.

01:43:26.292 --> 01:43:28.795
Trying to take
Billy's confidence.

01:43:28.828 --> 01:43:30.529
Come on, Billy,
now, come on.

01:43:30.563 --> 01:43:32.531
Escobar energetic,
bouncing on his feet.

01:43:32.565 --> 01:43:34.300
Escobar seems to be able to get

01:43:34.333 --> 01:43:36.435
anything that he wants...
He can hit him

01:43:36.469 --> 01:43:39.773
with a straight right, he can
hit him with a left hook...

01:43:39.806 --> 01:43:42.641
Nice slip! Nice slip!

01:43:42.675 --> 01:43:45.578
Billy Hope already with a mark

01:43:45.611 --> 01:43:48.647
- above the left eye.
- He's holding, ref! He's holding!

01:43:48.681 --> 01:43:51.317
Let him go. I got you.
Let him go.

01:43:53.953 --> 01:43:57.690
Escobar is hitting him, and
Tony Weeks steps in, in the corner.

01:43:57.723 --> 01:44:00.493
- You didn't see that?
- Let me see, let me see.

01:44:00.526 --> 01:44:03.997
It appears that Escobar has
drawn blood right here in round one.

01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:06.365
Well, Hope did his best

01:44:06.399 --> 01:44:08.334
to make Escobar pay
in round one.

01:44:08.367 --> 01:44:11.170
What he wasn't able to do
was make him miss.

01:44:11.204 --> 01:44:13.339
He's a fast motherfucker.

01:44:13.372 --> 01:44:15.008
That's all right, that's all right.
You faster.

01:44:15.041 --> 01:44:17.643
Don't worry about that.
Just do what we worked on.

01:44:17.676 --> 01:44:20.646
You make him miss, make him pay.
All right?

01:44:20.679 --> 01:44:25.418
By now, fans well
aware of the difficult passage

01:44:25.451 --> 01:44:28.621
Hope has been through...
The loss of everything, really,

01:44:28.654 --> 01:44:30.656
that was valuable to him,
including the loss,

01:44:30.689 --> 01:44:33.159
for a period of time,
of his hunger to fight.

01:44:33.192 --> 01:44:34.794
Come on, Billy!

01:44:34.828 --> 01:44:37.630
Round two begins, and it's Hope

01:44:37.663 --> 01:44:40.299
who's the aggressor
at the beginning.

01:44:40.333 --> 01:44:42.836
Now Escobar counters back.

01:44:42.869 --> 01:44:45.671
- Your defense! Come on!
- And Billy's doing

01:44:45.704 --> 01:44:48.374
just the opposite of what
a boxer is supposed to do.

01:44:48.407 --> 01:44:50.643
You're supposed to hit
and not get hit.

01:44:50.676 --> 01:44:52.578
Billy is not hitting,

01:44:52.611 --> 01:44:54.647
and getting the hell
knocked out of him.

01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:56.520
Come on, Billy, move
your head, move your head!

01:44:56.549 --> 01:44:58.852
Early on,
it looks like Escobar's jab

01:44:58.885 --> 01:45:01.087
is too quick for Billy Hope.

01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:04.457
Escobar working
downstairs and up,

01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:07.160
following the body shots
with hard punches upstairs.

01:45:10.263 --> 01:45:11.831
Good exchange right there

01:45:11.865 --> 01:45:13.332
before Tony separated them.

01:45:13.366 --> 01:45:16.035
Come on, baby,
you got this.

01:45:16.069 --> 01:45:18.237
Watch that right.
Just keep the pace.

01:45:18.271 --> 01:45:19.873
Use your speed.
Work your way inside.

01:45:19.906 --> 01:45:21.674
Let's go, Billy!
Don't give up, boy!

01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:24.510
First couple rounds

01:45:24.543 --> 01:45:26.345
seem to have gone
Escobar's way.

01:45:26.379 --> 01:45:28.814
Let's see if Hope
can raise his energy level

01:45:28.848 --> 01:45:30.316
and make it more of a fight.

01:45:30.349 --> 01:45:31.985
Move your head!
Move your head!

01:45:32.018 --> 01:45:33.252
Keep, keep him up!

01:45:49.568 --> 01:45:51.737
High time for Hope

01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:54.874
to begin working to the body
and try to turn things around.

01:45:54.908 --> 01:45:56.809
Three left hooks
to the ribcage.

01:45:56.842 --> 01:45:59.012
Escobar catches him
with a right.

01:45:59.045 --> 01:46:02.015
Down goes Hope.

01:46:02.048 --> 01:46:03.616
First knockdown of the fight.

01:46:03.649 --> 01:46:05.919
...three, four,

01:46:05.952 --> 01:46:08.021
- Get up, baby!
- Five...

01:46:08.054 --> 01:46:09.989
six...

01:46:10.023 --> 01:46:11.590
Get up! Get up!

01:46:11.624 --> 01:46:14.193
That left eye
is bleeding freely.

01:46:16.362 --> 01:46:18.797
You all right? You okay?
All right, sit down.

01:46:18.831 --> 01:46:20.233
No, no, no. His eye.

01:46:20.266 --> 01:46:21.700
He's hurt!

01:46:21.734 --> 01:46:23.469
And it looks already as though

01:46:23.502 --> 01:46:26.272
things may be slipping away
from Billy Hope.

01:46:26.305 --> 01:46:28.341
You got to keep
the pressure on, baby.

01:46:28.374 --> 01:46:30.443
Don't worry about
the eye, I got the eye.

01:46:30.476 --> 01:46:32.478
That's a
gruesome-looking left eye...

01:46:32.511 --> 01:46:34.147
If there was a problem,
they would stop the fight...

01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:35.848
There's not a problem, okay?

01:46:35.881 --> 01:46:37.516
- How's it look, Doc?
- I can see.

01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:39.452
- He's all right.
- Yeah, he's good to go.

01:46:39.485 --> 01:46:40.886
- Good! Good!
- Good to go.

01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:42.855
Well, Hope's fans would say

01:46:42.888 --> 01:46:45.224
it wouldn't be Billy
if he weren't bleeding.

01:46:45.258 --> 01:46:47.460
Show him.
It's time to show him, baby.

01:46:47.493 --> 01:46:48.827
Time to show him this time.

01:46:51.797 --> 01:46:55.234
Back in the center of the ring.

01:46:55.268 --> 01:46:56.902
Hope unloading
right-hand leads.

01:46:56.936 --> 01:46:58.938
- Come on, Billy, show up!
- Hope trying to tuck

01:46:58.972 --> 01:47:01.840
that injured left eye
behind his front shoulder.

01:47:01.874 --> 01:47:05.444
And Tick must be like
his Freddie Roach to Miguel Cotto,

01:47:05.478 --> 01:47:08.014
because Tick has done
a great job with his defense.

01:47:08.047 --> 01:47:11.017
Almost as though, Roy,
Billy Hope didn't show up again

01:47:11.050 --> 01:47:13.919
till the blood started to flow
from that left eye.

01:47:13.953 --> 01:47:15.921
Now Billy's showing up, Jim.

01:47:15.955 --> 01:47:19.525
I have never seen
Billy Hope block a punch.

01:47:19.558 --> 01:47:22.395
- This is unbelievable. Look at him.
- Nice!

01:47:22.428 --> 01:47:26.532
What a good three-punch
combination out of the shoulder roll

01:47:26.565 --> 01:47:28.467
right there, from Billy Hope.

01:47:28.501 --> 01:47:31.270
Come on, Billy!

01:47:31.304 --> 01:47:34.240
This is
Hope's best round so far.

01:47:38.477 --> 01:47:40.546
That's it! That's it!

01:47:40.579 --> 01:47:42.748
And they're talking
to each other

01:47:42.781 --> 01:47:45.451
in the center of the ring.

01:47:45.484 --> 01:47:47.286
Good.
Stay in the shell.

01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:49.655
Protect yourself. He's
switching his style up on us.

01:47:49.688 --> 01:47:51.524
- He's rolling his shoulder.
- I can't hit that motherfucker.

01:47:51.557 --> 01:47:53.959
- How's it looking, Doc?
- We got this, we got this.

01:47:53.993 --> 01:47:56.262
- I'm good, Doc.
- Okay, yeah, you're good to go.

01:47:56.295 --> 01:47:57.530
Get the fuck...

01:47:59.498 --> 01:48:01.667
You know who you are? You're a champion.
You can do it!

01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:03.036
This is yours, all right?

01:48:03.069 --> 01:48:04.037
You're a champion.

01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:05.571
Let's go!

01:48:05.604 --> 01:48:07.840
Halfway through
the 12-round fight

01:48:07.873 --> 01:48:11.844
in Las Vegas, now they're even: Hope
bleeding from above the left eye.

01:48:11.877 --> 01:48:15.314
Escobar bleeding
from above the right.

01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:23.822
Hope mounting
more and more offense now.

01:48:23.856 --> 01:48:27.793
And now he fires back
with a big right hand.

01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:32.631
- We got this.
- And they're working hard

01:48:32.665 --> 01:48:35.368
to keep that right eye together
for Escobar, in his corner.

01:48:35.401 --> 01:48:37.603
They're working just as hard

01:48:37.636 --> 01:48:39.838
to keep Billy Hope's left eye
in the fight.

01:48:42.675 --> 01:48:44.243
Hard right hand!

01:48:44.277 --> 01:48:45.844
Get off the rope!

01:48:45.878 --> 01:48:47.580
Hope trapped in the corner.

01:48:47.613 --> 01:48:49.848
Some of those shots
were blocked,

01:48:49.882 --> 01:48:52.151
but it was another big rally
for Miguel Escobar.

01:48:52.185 --> 01:48:54.287
Both men have been hurt

01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:56.055
in this round.

01:48:56.089 --> 01:49:00.025
Early rounds seemed to belong
to Miguel Escobar.

01:49:00.059 --> 01:49:02.828
Middle rounds definitely
belonged to Billy Hope.

01:49:02.861 --> 01:49:06.199
And now, as we come
to the 11th and 12th,

01:49:06.232 --> 01:49:11.370
it's a close fight on the table for
whichever fighter wants it most.

01:49:11.404 --> 01:49:13.106
- Shake it off, Billy!
- I'm fuckin' tired, man.

01:49:13.139 --> 01:49:15.108
He's more tired than you are.

01:49:15.141 --> 01:49:17.110
Two more, Billy... you just keep
doing what you're doing.

01:49:17.143 --> 01:49:19.645
That fucker hits hard
as a motherfucker.

01:49:19.678 --> 01:49:21.280
I need you to counter,
I need you to pivot.

01:49:21.314 --> 01:49:23.816
I need you to stay
in the shell. Hear me?

01:49:23.849 --> 01:49:25.651
You got to stay focused,
stay in this fight.

01:49:25.684 --> 01:49:27.453
- Punch and move.
- You were his fuckin' trainer!

01:49:27.486 --> 01:49:29.646
Why don't you tell me how to
fuckin' beat the guy, man?

01:49:31.490 --> 01:49:33.459
You're ready for this.
You ain't tired.

01:49:33.492 --> 01:49:35.728
You strong, you strong.
This is your time.

01:49:35.761 --> 01:49:37.596
This is your moment, Billy.

01:49:52.845 --> 01:49:54.880
Billy Hope! Billy Hope!

01:49:56.315 --> 01:49:57.850
Now with two rounds to go,

01:49:57.883 --> 01:50:01.120
let's see which man
can impose his will

01:50:01.154 --> 01:50:02.421
in the championship rounds.

01:50:02.455 --> 01:50:04.089
Come on, move, go!

01:50:04.123 --> 01:50:07.092
Both men bleeding
badly from one eye.

01:50:07.126 --> 01:50:08.927
Don't stay still! Let's go!

01:50:08.961 --> 01:50:11.464
It has elevated
to a state of war.

01:50:13.266 --> 01:50:15.434
That's right, Jim.

01:50:20.339 --> 01:50:23.942
There are cuts everywhere,
there's blood everywhere.

01:50:23.976 --> 01:50:26.479
Nothing to hold back now.

01:50:26.512 --> 01:50:31.116
Underneath it all,
a subtext of hatred,

01:50:31.150 --> 01:50:33.586
anger, revenge...

01:50:33.619 --> 01:50:36.355
which may or may not
be relieved

01:50:36.389 --> 01:50:38.924
by the violent combat

01:50:38.957 --> 01:50:42.027
in which they
now immerse themselves.

01:50:42.060 --> 01:50:43.962
That's it! That's what
I'm talking about! That's it!

01:50:43.996 --> 01:50:46.098
At this point,
it's a war of attrition...

01:50:46.131 --> 01:50:48.401
a fight to the finish.

01:50:48.434 --> 01:50:52.271
Listen, now, your wife
can't save you now, bitch!

01:50:52.305 --> 01:50:53.506
Yeah, she can't save you now.

01:50:56.775 --> 01:50:58.444
What you doing?
Stick to the plan!

01:50:58.477 --> 01:51:00.179
What are you trying to do?
Stick to the plan!

01:51:00.213 --> 01:51:02.014
Tony Weeks...

01:51:02.047 --> 01:51:04.650
is caught between two monsters,

01:51:04.683 --> 01:51:06.752
- as they fire away...
- What is he doing?

01:51:06.785 --> 01:51:09.788
- What's going on?
- What is he doing?

01:51:09.822 --> 01:51:11.690
What did he do to my dad?

01:51:11.724 --> 01:51:13.526
- What happened to him?
- It's okay, sweetie.

01:51:13.559 --> 01:51:15.761
What's wrong with him?

01:51:15.794 --> 01:51:17.896
Keep throwing them bars.
Just keep throwing them bars.

01:51:17.930 --> 01:51:19.565
Come on, keep it
playing with his head.

01:51:19.598 --> 01:51:21.200
Keep it playing...
Come on, Coach.

01:51:22.901 --> 01:51:24.803
All right,
you're about to blow this.

01:51:24.837 --> 01:51:27.240
You got to be calm,
you got to be calm.

01:51:27.273 --> 01:51:28.674
Everybody else
is walking slow.

01:51:28.707 --> 01:51:30.643
This world is yours,
this world is yours.

01:51:30.676 --> 01:51:32.645
Your soul is here...
Give me a towel.

01:51:32.678 --> 01:51:34.513
God is watching you.

01:51:34.547 --> 01:51:36.349
Your wife is watching you.

01:51:36.382 --> 01:51:38.351
I'm watching you.

01:51:38.384 --> 01:51:39.885
Your daughter's watching you.

01:51:39.918 --> 01:51:41.854
Don't let this man
control you.

01:51:41.887 --> 01:51:43.689
Don't let him
control you.

01:51:43.722 --> 01:51:46.024
This is exceptional to me.

01:51:46.058 --> 01:51:47.626
And part of a resurgent career,

01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:49.328
as Hope is trying to come back

01:51:49.362 --> 01:51:51.364
from life-damaging
circumstances,

01:51:51.397 --> 01:51:52.931
including, of course,

01:51:52.965 --> 01:51:55.668
the unexpected death
of his wife Maureen.

01:51:55.701 --> 01:51:57.035
Don't let him get
into your head.

01:51:57.069 --> 01:51:58.904
Don't let him
take this from you.

01:51:58.937 --> 01:52:01.340
You got one shot. Go southpaw.
Go southpaw on his ass.

01:52:01.374 --> 01:52:03.242
You go in there
and you kick his ass!

01:52:03.276 --> 01:52:05.010
You hear me? You show up,
you show him... you show him

01:52:05.043 --> 01:52:06.812
- Seconds out!
- You're Billy the Great!

01:52:06.845 --> 01:52:08.747
I want to see Billy the Great!

01:52:08.781 --> 01:52:11.550
You got to go out there
and you... beat his ass!

01:52:11.584 --> 01:52:12.751
Clap now.

01:52:14.587 --> 01:52:16.154
Already tonight,

01:52:16.188 --> 01:52:18.223
a lot of expectations
have been amended

01:52:18.257 --> 01:52:20.493
by the style of the fight,
by the competitiveness

01:52:20.526 --> 01:52:22.295
of the fight, and now...

01:52:22.328 --> 01:52:24.863
by the unexpected circumstance

01:52:24.897 --> 01:52:26.999
of us entering the 12th round

01:52:27.032 --> 01:52:29.502
of a fight that
no ringside expert

01:52:29.535 --> 01:52:33.639
ever dreamed could
possibly go the distance.

01:52:33.672 --> 01:52:35.774
- Come on, Billy!
- I'm not sure

01:52:35.808 --> 01:52:38.076
who's winning
this fight right now.

01:52:38.110 --> 01:52:43.215
Escobar tasted both of those
big punches, and now he's not throwing,

01:52:43.248 --> 01:52:45.284
as Hope lines him up
and tries to tee off.

01:52:45.318 --> 01:52:48.220
Escobar is in
trouble, he's in bad trouble.

01:52:48.253 --> 01:52:52.525
Now Escobar comes back
with his own combination!

01:52:52.558 --> 01:52:54.893
- Protect yourself!
- They take turns

01:52:54.927 --> 01:52:58.797
trading combinations
and covering up

01:52:58.831 --> 01:53:01.467
as the momentum shifts
back and forth

01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:04.437
from one fighter to the other.

01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:07.706
Tremendous uppercut by Hope!
And down goes Billy!

01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:09.775
Ref, come on! Come on!

01:53:09.808 --> 01:53:12.144
Tony Weeks
is gonna call it a low blow.

01:53:12.177 --> 01:53:14.112
He's hurting him.
He's hurting him.

01:53:14.146 --> 01:53:16.186
- It's okay, sweetie, it's okay.
- He's hurting him.

01:53:18.016 --> 01:53:19.718
Come on, Billy...!
Come on!

01:53:19.752 --> 01:53:21.454
One point, low blow.
Hear that?

01:53:21.487 --> 01:53:23.989
- One point, low blow...
- There's no count,

01:53:24.022 --> 01:53:27.460
and Escobar is losing a point
for the low blow.

01:53:27.493 --> 01:53:29.161
- Let me know when you're ready.
- I'm good.

01:53:29.194 --> 01:53:30.563
You ready?
Okay, here we go. Time in.

01:53:30.596 --> 01:53:32.097
Let's go.

01:53:32.130 --> 01:53:33.999
This could be critical

01:53:34.032 --> 01:53:38.871
for what should be very
close scores at this moment.

01:53:38.904 --> 01:53:41.139
We're about a minute away
from putting this

01:53:41.173 --> 01:53:43.342
in the hands
of three judges at ringside.

01:53:43.376 --> 01:53:45.243
Let's go!

01:53:45.277 --> 01:53:48.781
Hope needs one last big shot.
Both men all-out.

01:53:48.814 --> 01:53:52.851
Escobar comes back
with a hard right hand.

01:53:56.555 --> 01:53:57.823
Come on, man.

01:53:57.856 --> 01:53:59.758
Now we near the last minute

01:53:59.792 --> 01:54:03.261
of what has become
a spectacular seesaw fight.

01:54:06.632 --> 01:54:08.100
Switch up! Switch up!

01:54:08.133 --> 01:54:10.268
Now's the time, Billy!
Now's the time!

01:54:38.531 --> 01:54:41.333
Now Hope switches feet
for a southpaw uppercut,

01:54:41.366 --> 01:54:43.368
and down goes Escobar!

01:54:43.402 --> 01:54:45.504
Yeah, Billy! Yeah! Yeah!

01:54:45.538 --> 01:54:48.106
- Yeah!
- Southpaw! Yes!

01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:51.143
Tremendous left-hand
shot by Billy Hope.

01:54:51.176 --> 01:54:53.846
What an unbelievable
left uppercut

01:54:53.879 --> 01:54:55.047
from the southpaw position.

01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:56.982
...five, six...

01:54:57.015 --> 01:55:00.052
Wow! Who would've
ever seen this coming?

01:55:00.085 --> 01:55:01.787
- Come here. You good?
- I'm good.

01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:03.756
You good? Okay, fight's over.
Fight's over. It's over!

01:55:03.789 --> 01:55:06.559
Escobar is saved
by the bell,

01:55:06.592 --> 01:55:08.360
just as he was getting up.

01:55:08.393 --> 01:55:11.396
And Billy Hope finishes
the fight with a flourish.

01:55:11.430 --> 01:55:14.900
We'll see what that does
to the scorecards

01:55:14.933 --> 01:55:17.436
in what could have been
a very close fight.

01:55:17.470 --> 01:55:21.073
That may have been the
two-point round to get him over the hump.

01:55:21.106 --> 01:55:23.075
Whether he won
the fight or not,

01:55:23.108 --> 01:55:24.843
he'll have
tremendous satisfaction

01:55:24.877 --> 01:55:28.447
from having knocked
Miguel Escobar down.

01:55:28.481 --> 01:55:31.416
Now let's go to ring announcer
Jimmy Lennon Jr.

01:55:31.450 --> 01:55:34.520
To find out who's the winner.

01:55:34.553 --> 01:55:37.055
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:55:37.089 --> 01:55:39.492
after 12 rounds of action,

01:55:39.525 --> 01:55:41.694
we have a split decision.

01:55:43.962 --> 01:55:46.398
Judge at ringside, Casey Borne,

01:55:46.431 --> 01:55:49.968
scores the bout 115 to 113

01:55:50.002 --> 01:55:54.039
for Miguel Escobar.

01:55:54.072 --> 01:55:57.275
- No.
- Judge Raoul Fromes sees it...

01:55:58.844 --> 01:56:02.180
...115 to 114

01:56:02.214 --> 01:56:04.249
for Billy Hope.

01:56:08.253 --> 01:56:11.223
And Judge Ricky Quiles
scores the bout

01:56:11.256 --> 01:56:14.760
116 to 112...

01:56:14.793 --> 01:56:18.363
in favor of the winner...

01:56:18.396 --> 01:56:19.998
and the new...

01:56:20.032 --> 01:56:23.135
WBC Light Heavyweight Champion

01:56:23.168 --> 01:56:25.671
- of the World, Billy...
- He did it!

01:56:25.704 --> 01:56:27.439
He did it! He did it!
He did it!

01:56:27.472 --> 01:56:29.742
Hope...!

01:56:31.777 --> 01:56:33.679
Hope is back!

01:56:33.712 --> 01:56:35.681
Hope is on top again!

01:56:35.714 --> 01:56:37.916
Billy Hope has regained

01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:39.484
the Light Heavyweight
Championship of the World.

01:56:39.518 --> 01:56:42.955
Yes, Jim, we still have Hope.

01:56:42.988 --> 01:56:44.790
- Yes!
- Yes, Dad!

01:56:44.823 --> 01:56:46.663
What a spectacular
story here in Vegas tonight.

01:56:59.872 --> 01:57:01.439
No problem.
No problem.

01:57:08.981 --> 01:57:10.348
We did it, baby.

01:57:12.250 --> 01:57:14.853
What an amazing
moment of redemption

01:57:14.887 --> 01:57:16.755
for Billy Hope.

01:57:16.789 --> 01:57:18.523
Hey, baby...

01:57:20.225 --> 01:57:22.728
I'm ready.
Yeah, I'm ready.

01:57:22.761 --> 01:57:23.962
I'm ready.

01:57:26.599 --> 01:57:28.233
I'm ready. I'm ready.

01:57:30.035 --> 01:57:32.437
Hey, T. Come here.

01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:33.972
What?

01:57:34.006 --> 01:57:36.241
- It's your belt.
- It's for you, man.

01:57:36.274 --> 01:57:37.743
No, no, no.
That's-that's yours.

01:57:37.776 --> 01:57:39.011
Hey, hey, it's
too heavy, man!

01:57:39.044 --> 01:57:40.512
No, no. No, no... no, no.

01:57:43.916 --> 01:57:45.651
Everybody, great work.

01:57:45.684 --> 01:57:47.219
Very nice. Thank you.

01:57:47.252 --> 01:57:49.054
You got to hang that up
on the wall in the gym.

01:57:49.087 --> 01:57:51.289
- Up there for the kids.
- Yeah!

01:57:51.323 --> 01:57:53.525
Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy!

01:57:53.558 --> 01:57:54.693
Baby...

01:57:58.597 --> 01:58:03.301
Hey. Hey. Are you okay?

01:58:03.335 --> 01:58:05.337
Huh? Hmm?

01:58:05.370 --> 01:58:07.405
Yeah.

01:58:09.808 --> 01:58:11.777
- Hmm?
- I was scared for you.

01:58:11.810 --> 01:58:13.946
- Aw.
- It was so scary.

01:58:13.979 --> 01:58:17.850
Aw, baby,
you're so brave.

01:58:17.883 --> 01:58:19.451
You guys take care
of each other.

01:58:23.588 --> 01:58:25.490
I love you, Daddy.

01:58:26.992 --> 01:58:29.461
Yeah, baby.

01:58:32.297 --> 01:58:36.068
Your mother would be
so proud of you.

01:58:42.107 --> 01:58:44.910
Let's just go home, okay?

01:58:47.846 --> 01:58:49.815
Just go home, okay?

01:58:49.848 --> 01:58:51.283
Let's go home.

01:58:51.316 --> 01:58:54.386
Let's go home.

01:58:56.822 --> 01:58:59.257
I was so worried for you.

01:58:59.291 --> 01:59:00.558
Mm.

01:59:02.828 --> 01:59:04.830
Come here.

01:59:19.678 --> 01:59:20.779
Back up. Back up.

01:59:20.813 --> 01:59:22.280
Give the man some room.

01:59:22.314 --> 01:59:23.849
Back up.
