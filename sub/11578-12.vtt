00:01.036 --> 00:02.891
In the criminal justice system

00:02.956 --> 00:06.371
sexually-based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.444 --> 00:08.833
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives...

00:08.908 --> 00:10.597
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:10.667 --> 00:13.863
are members of an elite squad
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.931 --> 00:15.273
These are their stories.

00:22.890 --> 00:26.120
Miss Owens? It's Jimmy.

00:32.459 --> 00:33.570
Hello?

00:37.641 --> 00:39.681
I'm here to fix the toilet.

00:50.282 --> 00:51.623
Miss Owens?

00:55.946 --> 00:57.636
Mary, Mother of God.

01:01.929 --> 01:03.173
Who turned on the radio?

01:03.241 --> 01:05.031
It was on when she was found.

01:05.098 --> 01:06.592
Okay. And she is?

01:06.666 --> 01:08.738
Marnie Owens, age 37,
lived alone.

01:08.809 --> 01:10.271
The doc says
she was probably raped.

01:10.345 --> 01:12.254
The door doesn't look
like it was forced open.

01:12.330 --> 01:13.758
Yeah.
The lock worked this morning.

01:13.833 --> 01:15.175
That's the super.
He found her.

01:15.241 --> 01:16.451
Kill the radio.

01:17.770 --> 01:19.679
I came to fix the toilet.

01:20.297 --> 01:21.475
She call you?

01:21.544 --> 01:24.392
Last night. She said
it was keeping her awake.

01:25.065 --> 01:28.065
Then the boiler goes out.
I had to fix the heat first.

01:28.137 --> 01:29.860
Told her I'd be here today.

01:30.183 --> 01:31.559
Bedroom door open or closed?

01:31.625 --> 01:32.551
Closed.

01:32.616 --> 01:36.446
I heard music playing, like maybe she
slept through the alarm or something.

01:36.520 --> 01:40.547
I figured I better knock on it, you know,
in case I walked in on her undressed.

01:40.648 --> 01:42.174
Detectives.

01:42.697 --> 01:43.679
Give us a minute.

01:43.752 --> 01:45.410
I'm not going nowhere.

01:47.081 --> 01:49.862
Fluids and bruising
around the genitals.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.837
Cause of death?

01:51.911 --> 01:53.504
Manual strangulation.

01:54.216 --> 01:57.478
Bruising around the neck,
petechial hemorrhaging.

01:57.544 --> 01:59.615
Dead about 10, 12 hours.

01:59.687 --> 02:00.635
She put up a fight.

02:00.711 --> 02:02.654
You get anything from
underneath the fingernails?

02:02.727 --> 02:04.069
Nothing I can see.

02:04.391 --> 02:06.464
We'll know more
after the autopsy.

02:10.632 --> 02:12.225
Don't pick it up.

02:14.086 --> 02:15.265
Elliot.

02:16.551 --> 02:19.105
This is Marnie.
You know the drill.

02:20.294 --> 02:23.491
Marnie, it's Ruth. It's 10:00.
We're starting to worry.

02:23.624 --> 02:25.630
Please call as soon
as you get this. Bye.

02:25.702 --> 02:27.612
Caller ID says
New York City schools.

02:27.686 --> 02:28.766
Olivia.

02:39.975 --> 02:41.436
Her wall of fame.

02:42.181 --> 02:44.800
Outstanding teacher, 1998.

02:46.981 --> 02:48.388
School's out.

03:35.149 --> 03:39.110
So, Marnie Owens survives a tour of duty
in one of the city's worst high schools...

03:39.180 --> 03:40.806
but she isn't safe
in her own apartment.

03:40.875 --> 03:43.363
No doorman. All the doer
had to do was follow her in.

03:43.436 --> 03:45.858
Or be invited. No forced
entry into her apartment.

03:45.931 --> 03:48.037
If she had one, there were
no pictures. A boyfriend?

03:48.108 --> 03:49.701
Plenty of pictures
of students, though.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.681
Her dining room,
set up like a mini classroom.

03:51.756 --> 03:53.479
She seemed
like a very dedicated teacher.

03:53.547 --> 03:55.402
So we can't
rule out a student.

03:55.467 --> 03:56.514
What'd CSU turn up?

03:56.587 --> 03:59.271
Traces of semen on the bed and
two different colors of hair...

03:59.340 --> 04:00.354
one matching the victim's.

04:00.427 --> 04:02.499
Guy who found her,
building super.

04:02.572 --> 04:04.294
Record's clean, alibi checks.

04:04.363 --> 04:06.371
Also found a half-empty bottle
of Prozac.

04:06.442 --> 04:08.809
We had her job,
we might all be depressed.

04:08.876 --> 04:10.282
Any therapy appointments
in there?

04:10.348 --> 04:11.656
No. Just tutoring sessions.

04:11.723 --> 04:15.236
Last one was with Ethan
Chance, last night, 6:00.

04:15.531 --> 04:17.897
You two, go over
to Owens' school, all right?

04:17.962 --> 04:21.637
See if one of her hard case students
was giving her more trouble than usual.

04:22.283 --> 04:24.552
Poor Munch and Fin
get to canvas in the cold.

04:28.491 --> 04:30.115
Marnie was special.

04:30.186 --> 04:32.521
The kind of teacher
I'd like to clone.

04:33.355 --> 04:36.201
She took 10th graders reading
at a third grade level...

04:36.267 --> 04:39.528
and got them through Regents
Exam and into college.

04:40.074 --> 04:42.921
Her most challenging students
she tutored at home.

04:42.986 --> 04:43.848
No charge.

04:43.914 --> 04:44.864
That's dedication.

04:44.937 --> 04:47.459
Takes creativity to
motivate kids like that.

04:47.594 --> 04:49.481
Marnie did things like...

04:49.546 --> 04:53.190
having her seniors write plays
about their lives.

04:54.729 --> 04:58.374
Marnie helped them articulate
their fears and dreams.

04:58.442 --> 05:00.132
What about
her personal life?

05:00.201 --> 05:01.957
I'm surprised she had one.

05:02.217 --> 05:06.047
We were friends here, but Marnie never
shared much about her life outside.

05:06.312 --> 05:07.687
Did she seem depressed?

05:07.754 --> 05:08.736
No.

05:09.128 --> 05:12.260
She missed a meeting on Friday.
First time in five years.

05:12.329 --> 05:16.323
I asked her if anything was wrong. She
said it was nothing she couldn't handle.

05:16.393 --> 05:18.662
In her lesson planner,
she had a tutoring session...

05:18.728 --> 05:20.735
scheduled with
an Ethan Chance?

05:20.808 --> 05:22.052
One of her prodigies.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.608
Kid from a drug corner, has
a real shot at college now.

05:24.680 --> 05:26.590
We'll need to talk to him.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.794
This was Marnie's room.

05:31.305 --> 05:32.865
I'll get Ethan for you.

05:40.807 --> 05:42.369
You cops?

05:42.439 --> 05:43.454
Yes.

05:45.159 --> 05:48.159
My little girl is gonna
graduate because of Miss Owens.

05:49.159 --> 05:50.785
We're sorry for your loss.

05:51.015 --> 05:52.837
It's not just my loss.

05:53.064 --> 05:54.755
Look at these kids.

05:56.519 --> 05:58.374
Please find the man
that did this to us.

05:58.439 --> 06:00.227
We're doing everything we can.

06:03.975 --> 06:05.121
Excuse me.

06:05.191 --> 06:07.133
Ethan never showed up
for school this morning.

06:07.207 --> 06:08.800
We'll need his address.
Of course.

06:08.872 --> 06:09.886
Do you know
his parents?

06:09.958 --> 06:13.220
No father. Mother's a teller at
a bank on Canal and Lafayette.

06:15.143 --> 06:16.866
I thought he went
to school early.

06:16.934 --> 06:18.756
Principal said
he never showed up.

06:18.823 --> 06:21.757
Damn that boy. Miss Owens
is not gonna tolerate that.

06:23.143 --> 06:24.834
Miss Owens was murdered.

06:25.447 --> 06:26.940
Oh, dear God. No.

06:27.015 --> 06:29.086
Ethan had a tutoring session
with her last night.

06:29.158 --> 06:30.816
We thought he might
be able to help us.

06:30.885 --> 06:33.373
I owe her a lot.
She turned Ethan around.

06:33.447 --> 06:36.927
Showed him there were other possibilities
besides slinging dope on some corner.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.616
I told Ethan,
I don't visit nobody in jail.

06:39.686 --> 06:41.345
What time did he come home last night?

06:41.414 --> 06:43.803
Around 11:00. On school
nights, that's his...

06:44.165 --> 06:45.114
No.

06:45.190 --> 06:47.491
He's been in trouble for drugs,
but he's straightened out.

06:47.557 --> 06:49.052
He's a good boy.

06:49.125 --> 06:51.547
Did Ethan say anything
about his tutoring session?

06:52.230 --> 06:54.139
He just said
Miss Owens yelled at him.

06:54.213 --> 06:57.891
I asked him why, he runs into
his room and slams the door.

06:58.181 --> 06:59.675
I wake up this morning
and he's gone.

06:59.749 --> 07:00.862
Any idea where?

07:02.213 --> 07:05.725
When he cut school, he used to hang
out on the corner with some losers.

07:05.861 --> 07:07.291
Suffolk and Rivington.

07:08.389 --> 07:10.276
She lived next door
for six years.

07:10.821 --> 07:14.814
Came to visit me at the rehab
hospital after I fell last year.

07:14.884 --> 07:15.964
You knew her well?

07:16.037 --> 07:18.623
She was
such a nice girl.

07:19.109 --> 07:22.175
Not like that other one,
down the hall. That kurva.

07:22.245 --> 07:23.521
Yiddish for whore.

07:23.588 --> 07:26.458
Did you notice anybody come in or
out of Marnie's apartment last night?

07:27.364 --> 07:29.632
Well, one of her students.

07:29.860 --> 07:32.249
Yeah. He went in
around suppertime.

07:32.965 --> 07:34.044
Looked like a hood.

07:34.117 --> 07:35.490
Can you describe him?

07:35.555 --> 07:37.214
He was a Black kid.

07:37.509 --> 07:40.126
Wearing a kind
of a brown jacket.

07:40.195 --> 07:41.570
You hear anything?

07:41.636 --> 07:44.091
Some loud voices
while I was eating.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.374
What were they saying?

07:45.444 --> 07:47.713
My hearing is
as old as I am, Officer.

07:48.130 --> 07:52.408
My son had to buy me special headphones
for the TV just to hear my Rosie.

07:52.675 --> 07:54.562
Did you know any
of Marnie's boyfriends?

07:54.628 --> 07:56.122
What boyfriends?

07:56.579 --> 07:59.546
The only one I ever saw
was... What was his name?

08:00.067 --> 08:02.336
Byron. A doctor, no less.

08:02.852 --> 08:04.674
But he hasn't come around
for a while.

08:04.739 --> 08:05.884
What about family?

08:05.955 --> 08:07.930
Her parents passed away.

08:08.003 --> 08:10.392
All she had left
was her brother, Jordan.

08:10.627 --> 08:12.700
But I haven't seen him
for years.

08:17.571 --> 08:18.912
It's her.

08:21.538 --> 08:22.684
My God.

08:24.258 --> 08:26.909
Now I told her not to live in
a building without a doorman.

08:26.979 --> 08:28.385
We need to ask you
a few questions.

08:28.450 --> 08:29.431
Can't it wait?

08:29.506 --> 08:31.067
I understand
you're distraught.

08:31.138 --> 08:32.894
Just one question.

08:33.282 --> 08:35.866
Marnie's neighbor mentioned
a boyfriend, some doctor.

08:35.938 --> 08:38.687
Boyfriend. Try affair.
He was married.

08:39.682 --> 08:41.570
This affair have a name?

08:42.370 --> 08:43.897
Byron Marks.

08:43.969 --> 08:45.628
Surgeon over at Bellevue.

08:46.754 --> 08:49.536
I told her to stay away
from a married guy.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.175
We ain't doing nothing.

08:54.241 --> 08:55.769
Hi. You guys
seen Ethan around?

08:55.874 --> 08:57.084
Ethan Hawke?

08:57.152 --> 08:58.396
You got
the wrong 'hood, man.

08:58.465 --> 08:59.675
Don't play us.

09:01.506 --> 09:02.880
You talking
about Little E?

09:03.777 --> 09:05.468
He's too good
for us now, right?

09:05.536 --> 09:07.958
Ever since he got
his "edumacation."

09:08.033 --> 09:10.750
Is there some kind of school
holiday I don't know about?

09:10.817 --> 09:11.962
I got the flu.

09:12.033 --> 09:13.342
Yeah? What about you?

09:14.465 --> 09:15.741
It's contagious.

09:15.809 --> 09:17.532
We're gonna ask you
one more time.

09:17.601 --> 09:19.903
We don't like the answer,
we're gonna play show-and-tell.

09:19.969 --> 09:22.172
You want us to go
through your pockets?

09:22.656 --> 09:24.445
We don't look good
talking to y'all.

09:24.513 --> 09:26.749
Yeah, we told y'all.
What's up with this?

09:27.553 --> 09:28.413
Okay.

09:28.480 --> 09:32.091
Look. Yo, last night he was talking about
that teacher of his. He was down about it.

09:32.993 --> 09:34.039
Where was that?

09:34.113 --> 09:34.973
Schoolyard.

09:35.039 --> 09:36.152
What time?

09:36.224 --> 09:37.685
I don't know.
I don't got a watch.

09:37.760 --> 09:38.775
Yeah? What did he say?

09:38.848 --> 09:40.408
He was riled up about it.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.407
Why?

09:41.472 --> 09:42.813
They had some type of fight.

09:42.879 --> 09:44.057
What'd he say
about the fight?

09:44.128 --> 09:45.535
Ain't say nothing
about the fight.

09:45.599 --> 09:48.894
He just said he had to go home before
his mother came looking for him.

09:53.056 --> 09:55.706
I was separated.
I wouldn't call it an affair.

09:55.775 --> 09:58.492
Was Marnie the reason
you and your wife split?

09:59.902 --> 10:02.804
That was coming long before
I knew Marnie.

10:02.878 --> 10:04.155
How long did you two
go out?

10:04.224 --> 10:07.256
About a half a year. We met in a
mentoring program for inner-city kids.

10:07.326 --> 10:08.701
When's the last time
you saw her?

10:08.767 --> 10:10.555
The night we broke up.
Three months ago.

10:10.623 --> 10:11.605
What happened?

10:11.678 --> 10:13.467
I was looking
for a relationship.

10:13.535 --> 10:14.877
She wasn't.

10:14.943 --> 10:17.529
My experience is usually
the other way around.

10:17.599 --> 10:20.281
I'm a nester. I was more than
ready to settle down with Marnie.

10:20.351 --> 10:22.718
But the only commitment
she wanted was with her kids.

10:22.783 --> 10:24.027
We have to ask.

10:24.094 --> 10:26.233
Where were you last night
around 10:00?

10:26.878 --> 10:30.937
I was at dinner with my new girlfriend.
Spent the night at her apartment.

10:31.006 --> 10:32.414
She a nester?

10:33.694 --> 10:35.101
Just like me.

10:35.869 --> 10:39.098
I looked everywhere, called
everyone I know, all his friends.

10:39.166 --> 10:40.824
What else can I do?

10:41.150 --> 10:44.248
Well, would you mind if we
took a look around Ethan's room?

10:45.021 --> 10:46.777
It's that door right there.

10:50.813 --> 10:53.082
Your kids keep their rooms
this clean?

10:54.142 --> 10:55.253
I wish.

10:55.324 --> 10:56.819
Ethan's into sports.

10:56.893 --> 10:59.161
I make sure his schoolwork
comes first.

11:03.805 --> 11:04.950
Olivia.

11:09.565 --> 11:12.631
Looks like Miss Owens was teaching
her students more than just English.

11:12.701 --> 11:14.108
Facts of life.
What?

11:16.029 --> 11:18.647
Good lord.
What was she doing to my son?

11:19.452 --> 11:21.460
Ethan's mother doesn't know
what he was wearing...

11:21.533 --> 11:23.256
except that
his brown parka's missing.

11:23.324 --> 11:24.884
We thinking
he's the teacher's pet?

11:24.957 --> 11:26.363
The teacher
doing the petting.

11:26.429 --> 11:28.796
She seduces him, gets what
she wants, then dumps him.

11:28.860 --> 11:30.551
Teenage hormones
plus jealousy and rage?

11:30.620 --> 11:33.238
I'd call that a potentially
deadly combination.

11:33.596 --> 11:36.465
This picture didn't get
on the Internet by accident.

11:36.540 --> 11:38.744
Get Marnie's PC down
to computer crimes...

11:38.812 --> 11:41.911
find out what and who else
might be on that hard drive.

11:41.980 --> 11:43.321
The ex's story track?

11:43.388 --> 11:45.908
Said he was in the sack with
his latest squeeze Sunday night.

11:45.979 --> 11:47.223
We're still trying
to reach her.

11:47.292 --> 11:48.307
What about the funeral?

11:48.379 --> 11:50.713
Private. School's sponsoring
a memorial service tomorrow.

11:50.780 --> 11:54.936
You know, Ethan's probably feeling
guilty. Remorseful. He could be there.

11:55.355 --> 11:58.703
All right. We'll have a detail
outside the church, just in case he is.

11:58.780 --> 12:01.714
But for now don't rule out
any other possibilities.

12:01.787 --> 12:03.696
Photo unit will be there as well.

12:20.891 --> 12:22.962
Four of us
and hundreds of them?

12:23.066 --> 12:24.725
What, you don't like
those odds?

12:25.305 --> 12:27.061
Sounds like lottery odds
to me.

12:27.129 --> 12:28.690
Least this is almost over.

12:45.658 --> 12:48.757
I got a brown jacket heading
west toward the church.

12:52.666 --> 12:53.942
I see him.

13:00.793 --> 13:02.003
Negative.

13:05.528 --> 13:08.311
I got another one. Brown parka.
Heading east towards the church.

13:08.377 --> 13:10.165
Hood's up. Can't see the face.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.291
Him. Zoom in on him.

13:17.273 --> 13:18.995
It's him. Fin,
he's coming right at you.

13:19.448 --> 13:20.463
I got him.

13:42.807 --> 13:43.790
Move!

14:09.687 --> 14:11.575
Making me run on my bad knee.

14:11.639 --> 14:12.621
I didn't do anything.

14:12.694 --> 14:14.004
Your mother's
looking for you.

14:14.071 --> 14:15.412
You're under arrest.

14:15.479 --> 14:17.201
You have the right
to remain silent.

14:17.270 --> 14:18.285
You give up that right...

14:18.358 --> 14:21.041
anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.484
You have the right
to an attorney.

14:22.551 --> 14:25.070
If you can't afford one,
one will be appointed for you.

14:29.622 --> 14:31.116
Why'd you run?

14:36.150 --> 14:37.644
We found this
in your room.

14:37.718 --> 14:39.441
You want to explain it
to us?

14:40.981 --> 14:43.828
When did you and Miss Owens
start knocking boots?

14:44.500 --> 14:45.394
What?

14:45.461 --> 14:48.756
Come on, a hot teacher like her, she
comes onto you, you get something going...

14:48.822 --> 14:50.098
then she wants to turn it off. No!

14:50.165 --> 14:51.375
You couldn't stand it.

14:51.446 --> 14:53.900
But you couldn't stay away,
so what do you do?

14:53.973 --> 14:55.664
You show up to her service.

14:55.734 --> 14:56.943
I felt bad.

14:57.717 --> 15:00.335
I felt bad because
the last time I saw her...

15:01.237 --> 15:02.480
I called her a whore.

15:02.549 --> 15:03.977
'Cause she dumped you.

15:05.045 --> 15:06.605
Y'all got it all wrong, man!

15:06.677 --> 15:08.433
So tell us what's right.

15:14.229 --> 15:15.243
Come here.

15:17.140 --> 15:19.311
You were the last person
seen with her...

15:19.381 --> 15:20.657
you got this picture...

15:20.724 --> 15:22.219
okay, you're on the run.

15:22.292 --> 15:23.983
They line up
the dogs, man.

15:24.052 --> 15:27.914
If you don't give us something right
away, they're gonna turn the dogs loose.

15:31.187 --> 15:32.562
Little Camp gave me
that picture.

15:32.628 --> 15:34.035
What's his real name?

15:35.156 --> 15:36.268
Marcus Cole.

15:37.748 --> 15:41.229
Fool said he found it messing around
on some porn site on the Internet.

15:41.588 --> 15:44.076
She was advertising for guys
to have sex with her.

15:44.915 --> 15:48.461
Marcus said he was gonna spread that
picture around school to everybody.

15:48.819 --> 15:50.314
Why would he
want to do that?

15:50.963 --> 15:53.265
'Cause Miss Owens was
on his case about...

15:53.523 --> 15:55.213
not doing his work...

15:55.571 --> 15:57.033
cutting class.

15:58.418 --> 16:00.971
Tell us what happened
at the tutoring session?

16:04.786 --> 16:06.729
I showed her the picture.

16:10.931 --> 16:13.712
I tried to warn her about
what Marcus was gonna do.

16:14.578 --> 16:17.895
And she starts yelling. Yelling at
me like it's my fault or something.

16:19.794 --> 16:21.288
She tells me to get out.

16:21.810 --> 16:23.850
Well, that must have
made you angry.

16:25.138 --> 16:27.178
Look, I didn't
do anything, man.

16:28.370 --> 16:30.312
I did nothing.
I was just trying to help her.

16:30.386 --> 16:31.564
You disappeared.

16:31.634 --> 16:34.667
I went back to apologize the
next morning before school...

16:37.585 --> 16:40.072
and I get to her building
and you all were there.

16:40.977 --> 16:44.294
So I asked some guy in the crowd,
what's going on and he says...

16:48.849 --> 16:50.703
He says a woman
was murdered...

16:53.073 --> 16:54.502
on the third floor.

16:56.113 --> 16:58.285
Miss Owens lived
on the third floor.

17:02.608 --> 17:04.943
She never judged me
when I was in trouble.

17:08.337 --> 17:10.345
She told me
I could be somebody.

17:14.097 --> 17:15.559
I called her a whore.

17:18.032 --> 17:19.145
Ethan.

17:19.505 --> 17:20.911
Did Miss Owens ever touch you?

17:20.976 --> 17:23.758
It wasn't like that.
She never laid a hand on me.

17:29.232 --> 17:30.955
Ethan didn't do this.

17:31.024 --> 17:32.453
What about his friend?

17:32.528 --> 17:33.640
Marcus Cole...

17:33.712 --> 17:37.323
17, shoplifting, misdemeanor
assault and a string of drug busts.

17:37.392 --> 17:38.636
Nothing to send him upstate.

17:38.703 --> 17:40.133
Wait, we know this kid.

17:41.423 --> 17:43.279
Well, it's flu boy.
Yeah.

17:43.343 --> 17:45.514
It's one of the kids
from Rivington and Suffolk.

17:45.583 --> 17:46.925
Munch, Fin, pick him up.

17:48.687 --> 17:49.897
Flu better?

17:49.968 --> 17:51.691
What you want with me, man?

17:53.519 --> 17:55.209
Nice. I hear
it's getting around.

17:55.279 --> 17:56.228
Yeah. Thanks to you.

17:56.303 --> 17:58.026
So?
So where'd you get it?

17:58.094 --> 18:01.390
She was advertising on the Internet, you
know what I mean? I'm just a consumer.

18:01.455 --> 18:04.138
Yeah. I bet you are. But you
wanted the real deal, huh?

18:04.206 --> 18:05.254
You knew
where to find it.

18:05.326 --> 18:06.374
You saying I did it?

18:06.446 --> 18:07.429
You didn't like her.

18:07.503 --> 18:08.910
She wasn't gonna graduate me.

18:08.974 --> 18:11.724
News flash. You gotta show up
to class to graduate.

18:11.919 --> 18:13.609
You think I'd kill the bitch
over that?

18:13.678 --> 18:14.889
You spread
this picture around.

18:14.958 --> 18:16.235
Knew where she lived.

18:16.302 --> 18:18.571
I ain't been near her place
in months.

18:19.150 --> 18:21.769
We know where you were
Sunday night, 10:00.

18:21.838 --> 18:23.977
I was right
where you found me.

18:24.206 --> 18:25.450
You could ask my boys.

18:25.518 --> 18:27.340
Prove it. Take a blood test.

18:27.406 --> 18:29.381
Man, I'll take any test
you want.

18:31.790 --> 18:33.731
Well, that was too easy.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.372
Tox screen came back.

18:35.437 --> 18:37.860
Marnie didn't have Prozac or
anything else in her system.

18:37.933 --> 18:39.210
Where are we on the brother?

18:39.277 --> 18:41.034
Not exactly
screaming for justice.

18:41.101 --> 18:43.972
Well, it's time to pay him a
visit. Respectfully, please.

18:44.654 --> 18:45.995
He didn't want to kill her.

18:46.061 --> 18:47.371
Just her career.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.667
Well, we gotta be looking
in the wrong place.

18:53.230 --> 18:55.139
I mirrored her hard drive.

18:55.213 --> 18:58.659
The history in this thing
reads like some bad porno flick.

19:00.621 --> 19:02.530
The Luvstud's website?

19:02.604 --> 19:04.263
That's where
she ran the ad.

19:04.652 --> 19:07.783
Welcome to the red light
district of the new millennium.

19:07.853 --> 19:10.668
"Hot babe
looking for ten hotter guys.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.838
"I can take you all at once."

19:13.996 --> 19:16.517
Riding through life
on the sex superhighway.

19:17.452 --> 19:19.459
Hey, she save
any of the responses?

19:20.268 --> 19:22.504
If she stored her password,
I can tell you.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.441
There they are. Everything
from the last month.

19:30.476 --> 19:31.785
Print them.

19:35.020 --> 19:37.124
Yeah, I wish you guys would
just leave me alone.

19:37.196 --> 19:40.261
We need your help. Do you know
why your sister was on Prozac?

19:40.491 --> 19:42.858
Maybe the shrink I sent her to
prescribed It.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.345
Look, I don't mean
to sound cold...

19:45.420 --> 19:48.551
but I've been preparing myself
for this for a long time.

19:49.899 --> 19:51.841
You knew
about her secret life?

19:53.099 --> 19:54.790
Some people shoot heroin.

19:56.011 --> 19:57.986
Marnie's drug of choice
was sex.

19:58.411 --> 20:00.003
She ever talk to you
about it?

20:00.075 --> 20:01.734
She didn't have to.

20:02.411 --> 20:05.258
My room was right next to hers
when we were teenagers.

20:06.314 --> 20:07.688
I heard everything.

20:08.747 --> 20:10.340
Each time, a different guy.

20:10.954 --> 20:12.863
She was self-destructive.

20:13.034 --> 20:14.725
Your parents allowed this?

20:14.954 --> 20:17.889
My mother died of cancer
the year after I was born.

20:19.051 --> 20:22.050
Dear old Dad,
when he wasn't at work...

20:23.050 --> 20:25.636
was too drunk to care
about anything else.

20:26.154 --> 20:27.844
He ever abuse Marnie?

20:28.170 --> 20:29.598
He never touched her.

20:31.658 --> 20:34.145
But he just couldn't
keep his eyes off her chest.

20:36.042 --> 20:39.390
And he just couldn't keep his mouth
shut about how beautiful it was.

20:41.897 --> 20:43.424
What could I do?

20:44.970 --> 20:46.529
I was just a kid.

20:56.201 --> 20:58.787
It's called covert incest.

20:59.817 --> 21:03.165
You're a little girl.
Dad watches you take baths.

21:03.752 --> 21:05.540
Tells you dirty jokes.

21:05.833 --> 21:08.866
Mentions how great the sex was
last night with some woman.

21:08.936 --> 21:10.912
Twisted way to teach
the birds and bees.

21:11.208 --> 21:15.005
Then you hit puberty. Daddy
dearest admires your shape.

21:15.784 --> 21:19.745
Leaves porn magazines in your
room. Buys you sexy lingerie.

21:20.328 --> 21:23.940
Maybe takes you as his date to a
business dinner or a cocktail party.

21:24.008 --> 21:25.633
And when little girl
is all grown up...

21:25.703 --> 21:28.355
the only way she knows how to
relate to men is through sex.

21:28.423 --> 21:29.634
And Prozac helps?

21:29.704 --> 21:31.166
Prozac is for depression.

21:31.239 --> 21:34.371
Sex addicts are consumed
by loneliness and despair.

21:34.855 --> 21:36.350
Addicts are
self-centered people.

21:36.423 --> 21:38.016
Doesn't sound like
teacher of the year.

21:38.088 --> 21:39.942
You don't understand,
Detective.

21:40.008 --> 21:43.586
These people don't enjoy sex.
They're numb.

21:44.072 --> 21:46.918
They're gripped by some force
they can't control.

21:47.239 --> 21:50.174
It's like somebody who drinks
too much, snorts cocaine...

21:50.247 --> 21:51.654
bets the house on the ponies.

21:51.719 --> 21:54.337
And those addictions
are considered disorders.

21:54.599 --> 21:56.541
But when you have to have sex
three times a day...

21:56.614 --> 21:58.403
you're considered a pervert.

21:58.471 --> 22:02.333
Sex addicts carry so much shame,
they're always looking for redemption.

22:02.631 --> 22:05.598
So Marnie's dedication to her
students was her redemption.

22:05.703 --> 22:09.445
What surprises me is that she was
able to keep her secret for so long.

22:11.942 --> 22:13.982
Back in Baltimore, I come
into the office one day...

22:14.054 --> 22:16.029
everybody's staring at me
like my fly's open.

22:16.103 --> 22:17.084
I say, "What's up?"

22:17.158 --> 22:18.946
They send me across
the street to a gallery.

22:19.014 --> 22:20.956
One of my ex-girlfriends
is showing her work.

22:21.030 --> 22:23.583
Centerpiece is a wall-sized
print of yours truly...

22:23.654 --> 22:25.956
from his free-love days
au naturel.

22:26.022 --> 22:28.410
Serves you right for posing
nude in the first place.

22:28.486 --> 22:30.046
That's what I get
for sharing.

22:30.117 --> 22:32.223
You must have
some innermost secret.

22:32.870 --> 22:34.429
I'm a Republican.

22:35.301 --> 22:38.814
"I can go solo or duo,
but I prefer dirty dozen?"

22:38.886 --> 22:41.503
162 different e-mail responses
to her ad.

22:41.574 --> 22:43.035
That's a hell of a lot
of subpoenas.

22:43.109 --> 22:44.670
Psychiatrist give anything up?

22:44.742 --> 22:46.115
Marnie had a sex jones.

22:46.181 --> 22:48.483
Prozac was for the depression
associated with the addiction.

22:48.549 --> 22:50.305
We're just learning
how she fed her habit.

22:50.373 --> 22:52.926
She visited at least a
dozen sex sites on the web...

22:52.996 --> 22:55.168
that have clubs where you
can get up close and personal.

22:55.237 --> 22:57.539
There are LUDs that show a lot
of incoming calls...

22:57.605 --> 22:59.197
from various pay phones...

22:59.269 --> 23:01.789
but the outgoings
go an awful lot to...

23:01.861 --> 23:04.413
a number registered
to Pleasure Partners.

23:04.485 --> 23:07.868
Which also owns a swingers
club called Flings down in SoHo.

23:07.940 --> 23:09.401
You an expert?

23:10.084 --> 23:12.506
I got that
from her computer files.

23:23.268 --> 23:24.512
Welcome.

23:24.868 --> 23:25.815
Hi.

23:26.020 --> 23:28.224
$85 a couple.
Cash up front.

23:28.291 --> 23:31.902
We give you a private room
to change and do whatever.

23:33.955 --> 23:35.548
Olivia, you first.

23:36.612 --> 23:39.361
Don't be nervous, dear.
We were all beginners once.

23:39.587 --> 23:40.897
We're still beginners.

23:41.603 --> 23:43.545
We're not doing anything
illegal here, Officers.

23:43.619 --> 23:44.993
We're all consenting adults.

23:45.059 --> 23:47.994
So why don't you tell us what you
know about this consenting adult?

23:49.283 --> 23:51.289
Marnie's not
welcome here anymore.

23:51.619 --> 23:54.881
Well, maybe you're too busy to
read the paper, but Marnie's dead.

23:55.010 --> 23:57.215
Dead? How?

23:57.282 --> 23:58.232
She was murdered.

23:58.306 --> 23:59.899
And you think someone here
did it.

23:59.970 --> 24:01.629
Because we're all
sexual deviants, right?

24:01.698 --> 24:04.120
You said that Marnie wasn't
welcome here anymore. How come?

24:04.194 --> 24:05.623
She didn't follow the rules.

24:06.082 --> 24:07.392
You have rules?

24:07.554 --> 24:10.337
She had a threesome
with two married men.

24:10.402 --> 24:12.191
Started an affair
with one of them.

24:12.259 --> 24:16.251
So you don't approve of sex outside the
marriage unless it's done in this club?

24:16.321 --> 24:19.137
Despite what you may think,
we're happily married.

24:19.202 --> 24:23.064
One of our rules is, you have to preserve
the relationship with your primary partner...

24:23.138 --> 24:24.283
or you can't participate.

24:24.353 --> 24:28.445
We expelled Marnie and this gentlemen
when his wife told us about the affair.

24:28.514 --> 24:30.204
And this gentleman is?

24:30.274 --> 24:31.867
That's confidential.
I'm sorry.

24:31.937 --> 24:34.425
I'll tell you what, I'd be glad
to have the health department...

24:34.497 --> 24:36.864
come on down here
and take a look around.

24:37.249 --> 24:39.159
His name is Byron Marks.

24:41.057 --> 24:42.682
Guess the doctor was in.

24:47.393 --> 24:49.433
You said you met Marnie
in a mentoring program.

24:49.505 --> 24:51.163
Sounds more like
you were mentoring her.

24:51.233 --> 24:52.181
She came onto me.

24:52.257 --> 24:53.403
And you jumped right in.

24:53.474 --> 24:54.455
Till she dumped me.

24:54.529 --> 24:56.601
Yeah. That's pretty rough.
I've been there, pal.

24:56.673 --> 24:59.575
You're lonely, you go to her
apartment to get back with her.

24:59.648 --> 25:02.136
She lets you in. You gotta have
her. But she ain't giving it up.

25:02.209 --> 25:04.958
She turns her back on you.
You force her into the bedroom.

25:05.025 --> 25:07.293
Good evening, Detectives.
This interview is over.

25:07.360 --> 25:09.695
That's too bad 'cause we're
just getting to the good part...

25:09.761 --> 25:12.215
where we ask your client
to consent to a blood test.

25:12.288 --> 25:13.848
Can we have a moment?

25:20.064 --> 25:22.552
Dr. Marks would like to
clarify what he's told you.

25:25.056 --> 25:26.649
Keep my wife out of this.

25:26.719 --> 25:29.240
We'll keep her out of it,
if you stop lying.

25:33.631 --> 25:36.217
We met in a chat room.
We hooked up at Flings.

25:36.543 --> 25:39.293
And I wasn't lying
when I said she came on to me.

25:39.359 --> 25:40.733
And you had an affair.

25:40.799 --> 25:41.977
That's all we wanted.

25:42.047 --> 25:43.323
Till it got out of control.

25:43.392 --> 25:44.406
How?

25:46.430 --> 25:48.154
We were having sex
every day.

25:48.639 --> 25:50.394
Sometimes two
or three times.

25:51.327 --> 25:55.866
Wherever we could. Hotels,
my office, clubs.

25:56.734 --> 25:58.807
Till we burned out, broke up.

26:00.574 --> 26:02.941
It's like we used each other
up and threw each other away.

26:03.006 --> 26:04.697
What happened Sunday night?

26:07.326 --> 26:10.523
My wife was at the gym when
Marnie called around 7:00.

26:10.878 --> 26:12.950
She's out of her mind.
Tells me she needs me.

26:13.022 --> 26:14.232
I get there.

26:14.302 --> 26:17.434
Says some student found
her picture on the Internet.

26:18.494 --> 26:19.901
That it could ruin her.

26:19.966 --> 26:21.210
Did you have sex?

26:23.901 --> 26:25.528
She needed it. So did I.

26:25.597 --> 26:27.092
How long were you there?

26:29.246 --> 26:31.667
Till 8:30.
She was very much alive.

26:31.743 --> 26:35.255
My client admits he was there
that night. But he didn't kill her.

26:36.030 --> 26:37.917
You don't understand.

26:40.285 --> 26:42.227
It's like being possessed.

26:46.973 --> 26:49.755
Like some uncontrollable,
overwhelming urge...

26:51.164 --> 26:54.230
and something grabs hold of me
and won't let go...

26:56.284 --> 26:58.325
till I satisfy it with sex.

27:00.860 --> 27:05.050
And then I'm okay,
till the next wave hits.

27:07.420 --> 27:09.362
Where else did Marnie arrange
to meet her men?

27:09.436 --> 27:12.403
When she had a date, she usually took
them to the Majestic on 7th Avenue.

27:12.476 --> 27:14.384
She needed a quick fix,
she went to the club.

27:14.460 --> 27:16.565
I thought she was banned
from Flings.

27:16.636 --> 27:18.010
This other place.

27:18.940 --> 27:21.044
I only went there
with her once.

27:22.427 --> 27:24.370
It's like walking into hell...

27:24.443 --> 27:27.956
just as sleazy.
Dante's Inferno.

27:32.379 --> 27:34.517
I didn't know
Marnie liked it so rough.

27:37.435 --> 27:40.020
Police! All right,
everybody up.

27:40.091 --> 27:41.914
All right,
let's get our clothes on.

27:41.979 --> 27:43.156
Let me see your hands!

27:43.227 --> 27:45.528
That side of the wall, please.
Line up here.

27:45.595 --> 27:47.351
We got enough room here.
Right now.

27:47.419 --> 27:48.368
Straight line.

27:48.442 --> 27:50.298
Cover yourself, please.

27:53.723 --> 27:56.821
We got a tame crowd here tonight.
All we got is an ounce of weed.

27:56.891 --> 27:59.127
The TV news is outside.

27:59.898 --> 28:02.801
Here's a pop quiz. My friends
are gonna show you a photo.

28:02.875 --> 28:05.461
Her name is Marnie Owens,
though I suspect you people...

28:05.530 --> 28:07.386
exchange fluids
more often than names.

28:07.450 --> 28:12.054
Anybody who recognizes her, raise
the hand not holding up your clothes.

28:13.722 --> 28:15.096
Anybody?

28:16.761 --> 28:19.512
Apparently these upstanding people
don't understand the question.

28:19.577 --> 28:21.814
All right. So here's
what we're gonna do.

28:21.883 --> 28:25.264
Whoever tells us what they know about
Marnie, we take you out the back door.

28:25.337 --> 28:28.949
Everybody else, they get their 15 minutes
worth of fame in front of the cameras...

28:29.018 --> 28:30.195
through the front door.

28:30.266 --> 28:32.306
Let's try it again. Anyone?

28:38.009 --> 28:39.383
There we go.

28:43.610 --> 28:47.865
Well, let's see. Promoting prostitution.
Third offense. No plea bargain.

28:47.929 --> 28:49.620
Sounds like seven years
at Fishkill.

28:49.688 --> 28:51.510
Nobody's getting hurt.

28:53.400 --> 28:54.862
Start talking.

28:55.481 --> 28:56.942
What's in it for me?

28:57.016 --> 28:59.602
We'll tell the A.D.A.
you cooperated.

28:59.801 --> 29:01.971
She came in a couple of times
a week.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.350
When did you last see her?

29:03.417 --> 29:04.758
Friday night.

29:04.985 --> 29:08.181
She didn't come in Saturday.
Two guys actually left.

29:08.888 --> 29:10.579
That gal was great
for business.

29:10.648 --> 29:11.695
How so?

29:11.768 --> 29:13.743
She was as wild as they come.

29:13.816 --> 29:17.526
She wouldn't do bi, but she'd
do three guys at one time.

29:17.720 --> 29:19.344
Then three more
and three more.

29:19.416 --> 29:20.431
We get it.

29:20.503 --> 29:22.096
She liked it rough, too.

29:22.167 --> 29:23.728
You ever participate?

29:23.800 --> 29:25.457
I'm an entrepreneur.

29:25.528 --> 29:28.790
It wouldn't be professional for me
to get involved with the clients.

29:28.855 --> 29:32.052
Anyone show up tonight who took
a special interest in Marnie?

29:33.335 --> 29:36.270
One guy. Came in
with the rest of us.

29:41.816 --> 29:43.572
Ten down, five to go.

29:45.078 --> 29:46.289
You see him?

29:46.360 --> 29:48.596
Second from the end,
in the chairs.

29:52.310 --> 29:55.857
He's up next with Olivia and
Elliot. Fancied Miss Owens.

29:58.487 --> 29:59.981
You, go with him.

30:00.246 --> 30:01.556
Follow that detective.

30:01.623 --> 30:03.030
He liked Marnie.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.161
Isn't that special?

30:07.350 --> 30:08.943
What's your name?

30:09.174 --> 30:11.442
Am I charged
with anything here?

30:11.798 --> 30:13.391
How about adultery?

30:14.358 --> 30:16.213
It's still on the books.

30:16.278 --> 30:17.390
Your turn.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.910
Phillip Montrose.

30:23.478 --> 30:24.906
You know her?

30:26.678 --> 30:30.507
That schoolteacher who was killed.
I read about it in the paper.

30:30.614 --> 30:33.777
Okay. We can do this here or we
can do it at Rikers. It's up to you.

30:35.989 --> 30:38.225
I saw her picture
on a web site.

30:38.773 --> 30:39.722
And?

30:39.957 --> 30:42.194
She looked hot.
I e-mailed her.

30:42.485 --> 30:43.729
She answer you back?

30:43.797 --> 30:45.226
She invited me to meet her.

30:45.300 --> 30:47.243
Majestic Hotel
on 7th Avenue.

30:47.316 --> 30:48.594
What happened?

30:49.236 --> 30:50.578
We go at it.

30:50.645 --> 30:53.993
She tells me to meet her
the next night at Dante's.

30:54.580 --> 30:56.489
I thought
it was a restaurant.

30:57.045 --> 30:59.467
I asked her what they serve
and she laughs...

30:59.540 --> 31:03.184
and tells me they have the
most extensive menu in town.

31:04.884 --> 31:05.866
What'd you order?

31:05.941 --> 31:08.013
She ordered for both of us.

31:08.213 --> 31:11.344
Sex, with me
and four other guys.

31:11.764 --> 31:13.257
You go back there
with her?

31:13.332 --> 31:14.738
Lots of times.

31:16.020 --> 31:18.508
You know, sounds like
you're attracted to her.

31:19.284 --> 31:23.276
The place is like an amusement
park. She was my favorite ride.

31:24.563 --> 31:25.992
A rough ride?

31:26.068 --> 31:29.362
She liked it that way.
So do I.

31:31.891 --> 31:34.030
Where were you Sunday night
at 10:00?

31:34.387 --> 31:35.696
At my in-laws.

31:35.763 --> 31:39.560
Trying to reconnect with my wife
and two kids. We're separated.

31:41.843 --> 31:46.315
Byron Marks alibi checks out. Doorman
says he came home at 10:00 p. m.

31:46.386 --> 31:47.979
Didn't leave
until the next morning.

31:48.051 --> 31:49.676
Not a killer, just a perv.

31:49.747 --> 31:51.438
We're talking
about victimless crime.

31:51.507 --> 31:52.587
Unless you're Marnie Owens.

31:52.658 --> 31:54.601
Marnie Owens problem wasn't
that she had group sex.

31:54.674 --> 31:56.267
It was that
she couldn't stop herself.

31:56.338 --> 31:58.859
We got 14 others here from
Dante's. What's their excuse?

31:58.931 --> 32:01.745
You mean the fireman, the accountant,
the director of human resources?

32:01.811 --> 32:04.810
All consenting adults, behind
closed doors, nobody gets hurt?

32:04.881 --> 32:06.027
They don't need an excuse.

32:06.098 --> 32:09.677
That's easy for you to say, Mr. Letting-it-
all-hang-out- at-some-art-gallery.

32:09.746 --> 32:13.488
All right. Last time I looked,
this was the Special Victims Unit...

32:13.554 --> 32:15.146
not the sex police.

32:15.218 --> 32:17.519
These are photos
from the memorial service.

32:17.586 --> 32:19.690
Okay, Phillip Montrose
was arrested...

32:19.762 --> 32:22.543
for criminal trespass
two months ago in Connecticut.

32:22.769 --> 32:24.908
Stamford police say that
he was booked for stalking.

32:24.977 --> 32:26.090
D.A. knocked it down.

32:26.162 --> 32:30.220
Well, Montrose told us that he left Dante's
last Saturday because Marnie wasn't there.

32:30.289 --> 32:31.816
But he did...

32:32.913 --> 32:34.669
go to her memorial service.

32:36.145 --> 32:38.151
I guess he wanted
to pay his respects.

32:38.225 --> 32:40.397
Or stalk her to the grave.

32:49.553 --> 32:51.974
So I went to the service.
That's a crime?

32:52.048 --> 32:54.863
You sorry that your favorite
ride was closed for good?

32:54.928 --> 32:58.092
I told you, we had a good
time. I'm gonna miss her.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.006
It's touching.

33:00.369 --> 33:02.638
We heard you had a problem
in Connecticut.

33:02.704 --> 33:04.231
Criminal trespass.

33:04.304 --> 33:07.174
It was a misunderstanding. I haven't
been near that woman in months.

33:07.248 --> 33:10.510
You know, most stalkers only give up
after they've found another target.

33:10.577 --> 33:13.358
Marnie wasn't just
my favorite ride, okay.

33:13.424 --> 33:16.173
She did every guy
that walked into that place.

33:16.751 --> 33:19.369
We checked on your alibi
with your wife.

33:19.472 --> 33:22.090
She says she hasn't seen you or
her child support in three weeks.

33:22.159 --> 33:25.160
Yeah. Well, she'll say anything
to get back at me, now, won't she?

33:25.743 --> 33:27.336
I got work to do.

33:31.727 --> 33:35.524
You know, Ethan said that some guy,
outside of Marnie's apartment building...

33:35.599 --> 33:37.639
told him she was murdered.

33:37.711 --> 33:39.654
Think it could
have been Montrose?

33:39.727 --> 33:43.469
We know these guys sometimes like to
come back and admire their handiwork.

33:49.391 --> 33:50.984
You ever seen this guy here?

33:51.055 --> 33:53.902
Yeah, I booted him twice.
Last Friday, I think.

33:53.966 --> 33:55.395
He say why he was here?

33:55.470 --> 33:57.031
Claimed he needed
to use the restroom.

33:57.102 --> 33:59.524
I told him to use the head in
the restaurant across the street.

33:59.598 --> 34:00.645
And he came back?

34:00.718 --> 34:03.206
Half an hour later, caught
him trying the door to the gym.

34:03.279 --> 34:05.351
Threatened to call you guys
if he didn't split.

34:05.422 --> 34:07.145
Never saw him again.

34:09.293 --> 34:11.748
Marnie might still be alive
if she'd just called us.

34:11.822 --> 34:15.498
She reports the stalking, her
secret gets out, career's over.

34:15.790 --> 34:17.447
She was afraid
of being judged.

34:17.518 --> 34:18.466
She was right.

34:18.541 --> 34:19.621
Hey.

34:19.694 --> 34:21.603
Did you guys find out
who killed Miss Owens yet?

34:21.677 --> 34:23.204
We're still working
on that.

34:23.534 --> 34:25.900
Well, thanks to her,
I got a full scholarship.

34:25.966 --> 34:27.013
Temple University.

34:27.085 --> 34:28.295
Congratulations.

34:28.364 --> 34:31.780
Check this out, huh?
You ever seen this guy?

34:32.878 --> 34:34.732
Yeah, outside
Miss Owens' building.

34:34.797 --> 34:36.139
The morning
y'all found her dead.

34:36.205 --> 34:38.245
He's the one that told me
she was murdered.

34:46.126 --> 34:47.237
How can I
help you, Officers?

34:47.308 --> 34:49.065
We got a warrant
to search your apartment.

34:49.132 --> 34:50.311
We also have
another warrant...

34:50.380 --> 34:53.031
compelling you to a blood test
for DNA comparison.

34:54.380 --> 34:56.268
I'll call my lawyer now.

34:56.333 --> 34:58.405
Have him meet us down at
the medical examiner's office.

34:58.476 --> 34:59.883
We'll be giving you
a ride.

34:59.948 --> 35:01.410
Check this out.

35:02.220 --> 35:03.235
Family photos?

35:03.308 --> 35:05.479
More like
a stalker's scrapbook.

35:06.092 --> 35:07.913
Telephoto lens.

35:08.972 --> 35:10.827
You like taking pictures,
Phillip?

35:16.492 --> 35:18.117
The scrapbook proves nothing.

35:18.187 --> 35:19.562
It makes our case
even stronger.

35:19.628 --> 35:22.496
You'll never get an indictment. This
woman makes Casanova look celibate.

35:22.571 --> 35:24.000
Which the grand jury
will never hear.

35:24.075 --> 35:26.758
What they will hear is that your
client's DNA was inside the victim.

35:26.827 --> 35:27.809
As was another man's.

35:27.883 --> 35:30.087
They will also hear from the
woman he previously stalked.

35:30.155 --> 35:32.359
They will hear from witnesses
who can place your client...

35:32.427 --> 35:34.948
at both her apartment and her
school the morning she was found.

35:35.020 --> 35:38.631
And they will see your client's
scrapbook filled with memories of Marnie.

35:42.027 --> 35:43.433
About 7:00 in the morning,

35:43.499 --> 35:45.322
I got to Miss Owens'
apartment building...

35:45.387 --> 35:46.980
and the police were there.

35:47.051 --> 35:48.873
What happened next?

35:48.939 --> 35:50.661
I asked what was going on.

35:51.370 --> 35:52.777
Did anybody answer you?

35:52.842 --> 35:54.631
Yeah. Some guy
in the crowd.

35:54.954 --> 35:56.842
What exactly did he say?

35:57.386 --> 36:00.582
He said some woman who lived on the
third floor was raped and strangled.

36:00.651 --> 36:02.025
A teacher.

36:02.538 --> 36:05.255
And did you later come to
know the identity of this man?

36:05.321 --> 36:07.590
Yeah. Phillip Montrose.

36:08.458 --> 36:09.984
Thank you, Ethan.

36:10.505 --> 36:12.927
Ladies and gentlemen
of the grand jury...

36:13.001 --> 36:15.270
Phillip Montrose revealed
a detail of the crime...

36:15.339 --> 36:19.680
that could only have been known at
that time by the police and the killer.

36:20.650 --> 36:22.144
I hope that
you will consider...

36:26.506 --> 36:27.815
Excuse me.

36:31.369 --> 36:32.318
What's going on here?

36:32.392 --> 36:34.248
My client wishes
to exercise his right...

36:34.312 --> 36:35.873
to make a statement
to the grand jury.

36:35.945 --> 36:36.839
Too late.

36:36.904 --> 36:37.985
They haven't voted.

36:38.056 --> 36:40.161
I know what you're trying
to do and it won't work.

36:40.233 --> 36:43.081
Well, you got to play to win.
Let's see what a judge decides.

36:49.032 --> 36:53.505
190.50 of the CPL states that notice
must be filed in a timely fashion.

36:53.576 --> 36:54.624
Read the statute.

36:54.697 --> 36:58.242
It says the defendant can appear as long
as the indictment has not been filed.

36:58.311 --> 36:59.555
They haven't even voted yet.

36:59.624 --> 37:02.210
You told me yesterday your
client declined to testify.

37:02.280 --> 37:04.865
Well, he's changed his mind.
He has that right.

37:04.936 --> 37:08.383
Your Honor, his entire strategy is to
blame the victim for her own murder.

37:08.456 --> 37:12.384
He is going to poison the grand jury by
revealing Marnie Owens' sexual history.

37:12.519 --> 37:13.982
It's all relevant.

37:14.056 --> 37:17.765
Mr. Matthews, you are right on
the edge of a call from me...

37:17.831 --> 37:19.206
to the Disciplinary Committee.

37:19.272 --> 37:21.824
If you deny my client his
rights and he is indicted...

37:21.895 --> 37:23.837
I will move for dismissal.

37:24.071 --> 37:27.419
Of course you will. And I'll
have to grant the motion.

37:27.496 --> 37:29.470
And you will have
to re-present the entire case.

37:29.543 --> 37:30.492
Your honor, I think...

37:30.567 --> 37:32.804
I don't like it any more
than you do.

37:33.127 --> 37:36.062
But you can still get him
on cross-examination.

37:36.422 --> 37:40.546
He's a sitting duck because
Mr. Matthews here can't object.

37:44.838 --> 37:49.377
I met Marnie Owens through a personal
ad she placed on an Internet web site.

37:49.638 --> 37:52.005
She was looking
for a sex partner.

37:52.999 --> 37:55.966
She invited me
for an hour-long quickie...

37:56.039 --> 37:57.980
at a midtown hotel.

37:58.598 --> 38:02.210
She then invited me
to a sex club...

38:02.663 --> 38:04.517
called Dante's Inferno.

38:04.583 --> 38:09.186
That night, I was one of five
men who had intercourse with her.

38:11.173 --> 38:14.785
We returned to the club
together numerous times.

38:15.717 --> 38:20.290
On the night of her murder,
Marnie came to my apartment.

38:21.573 --> 38:24.093
She was desperate. She said...

38:24.165 --> 38:28.159
a student she brought home saw the
nude photo of her in the Internet ad.

38:29.382 --> 38:32.610
She was worried that it would
ruin her teaching career.

38:34.149 --> 38:37.051
She asked me to have sex...

38:38.661 --> 38:40.089
and I agreed.

38:40.677 --> 38:42.946
She was insatiable.

38:44.964 --> 38:48.128
I did not kill her.

38:50.788 --> 38:52.096
Thank you.

38:56.357 --> 38:59.454
You had sex with Miss Owens
the night she was murdered.

39:00.068 --> 39:01.693
Why did you lie
to the police?

39:01.765 --> 39:04.131
I'm in the middle
of a bitter divorce.

39:04.196 --> 39:07.513
It's ammunition for my wife
if this comes out.

39:08.355 --> 39:11.487
Didn't you keep a scrapbook of
photos you had taken of Miss Owens...

39:11.555 --> 39:12.766
without her knowledge?

39:12.837 --> 39:16.032
Marnie saw those photos.
They excited her.

39:16.099 --> 39:19.896
Didn't you tell police
she was "your favorite ride"?

39:20.164 --> 39:23.841
Nobody forced Marnie to do anything
at Dante's she didn't want to do.

39:23.907 --> 39:26.297
Just answer the question.
Did you say that?

39:30.083 --> 39:31.031
Yes.

39:31.107 --> 39:34.107
Didn't you also go to her apartment
the morning after she was murdered?

39:34.178 --> 39:35.193
I was worried about her.

39:35.268 --> 39:36.861
Where you told
a young bystander...

39:36.932 --> 39:38.306
she had been strangled
and raped?

39:38.370 --> 39:40.639
How do you think
I found out about it?

39:41.028 --> 39:43.809
Somebody there told me.
I didn't know the details.

39:43.874 --> 39:46.143
You followed her to school,
you followed her home.

39:46.210 --> 39:47.901
You were jealous, angry,
weren't you?

39:47.970 --> 39:48.898
I wasn't.

39:48.963 --> 39:50.849
Because she was having sex
with other men.

39:50.914 --> 39:53.117
You think I was jealous
of that slut?

39:53.186 --> 39:56.667
You have to care about someone
to be jealous. She was a whore.

39:56.738 --> 39:58.876
Stick to the facts relevant
to the case, Mr. Montrose.

39:58.946 --> 40:00.539
Those are the facts.

40:00.610 --> 40:04.255
She'd spread her legs for
anybody, anywhere, any time.

40:04.322 --> 40:05.751
As many as she could.

40:05.827 --> 40:08.793
She'd pick up guys off the
streets and bring them home.

40:08.867 --> 40:12.575
She liked it rough! She was
asking for this to happen.

40:12.641 --> 40:15.641
God only knows who Marnie picked
up on her way home from my place...

40:15.713 --> 40:17.175
because she needed
another fix.

40:17.250 --> 40:18.908
She needed a fix?

40:18.978 --> 40:21.793
You stalked a woman in Connecticut,
then you stalked Marnie Owens.

40:21.857 --> 40:23.319
Now she's dead.

40:23.618 --> 40:26.038
What about your fix,
Mr. Montrose?

40:37.857 --> 40:39.286
What happened?

40:39.681 --> 40:42.495
Montrose and his lawyer put
Marnie's sex life on trail.

40:45.889 --> 40:48.376
Law isn't always
about justice.

40:48.448 --> 40:51.034
Who let you in
on our dirty little secret?

40:51.776 --> 40:54.045
All the Marnies
who came before.

40:57.088 --> 40:59.030
That bastard's
gonna beat this.

40:59.103 --> 41:01.177
Don't second-guess
yourself, Alex.

41:01.568 --> 41:03.576
From where I'm sitting,
you did everything right.

41:03.648 --> 41:06.615
And I would be the first one
to tell you if you didn't.

41:15.999 --> 41:17.309
Thank you.

41:22.431 --> 41:23.992
We have an indictment?

41:24.063 --> 41:25.078
Yes.

41:26.016 --> 41:27.477
Good work, Alex.

41:27.551 --> 41:28.566
What?

41:29.023 --> 41:32.022
They didn't go for murder two.
It's manslaughter one.

41:32.287 --> 41:34.142
Grand jury couldn't
get past her sex life.

41:34.207 --> 41:36.247
The son of a bitch
is gonna get away with murder.

41:36.319 --> 41:38.107
No. They listened.

41:38.304 --> 41:40.245
They think Montrose is guilty,
a jury will, too.

41:40.319 --> 41:41.563
Not life.

41:41.631 --> 41:44.729
Fifteen to 25 to sit around
and think about what he's done?

41:44.798 --> 41:46.173
I'll take that.
