18:55.567 --> 18:56.700
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

18:56.700 --> 18:59.100
THE LIGHT BEAM
HIT YOU, AND
YOU'RE ALIVE.

18:59.100 --> 19:01.033
YEP. SUNSCREEN.
S.P.F. 45.

19:01.033 --> 19:03.100
PLUS A LITTLE
ZINC OXIDE ON MY BUM.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.767
MAYBE NEXT TIME, SATAN.
SORRY, GUYS.

19:05.767 --> 19:07.300
[COVEN MOANS]
YEAH, IT'S A SHAME.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.467
SHUT UP. COME ON,
EVERYBODY OUT! SCRAM!

19:09.467 --> 19:13.867
SATAN'S CHILDREN,
BE GONE WITH
YOU ALL! COME ON!

19:13.867 --> 19:16.600
IT'S TOO BAD.
YOU'RE CUTE. YOU'RE SWEET.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.300
YOU'D HAVE BEEN
THE PERFECT SACRIFICE.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.300
I APPRECIATE THAT.

19:21.300 --> 19:24.100
HEY, MILLIE...

19:24.100 --> 19:26.000
KEYS.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.800
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A SHAME

19:30.800 --> 19:32.867
YOU DIDN'T
FALL FOR ME.

19:32.867 --> 19:35.400
IT COULD'VE
BEEN GOOD.

19:38.734 --> 19:41.734
ERIC, WHEN I SAW
THAT LIGHT BEAM,
WAS THAT REAL?

19:41.734 --> 19:45.900
JACK, MAYBE IT WAS,
AND MAYBE IT WASN'T.

19:45.900 --> 19:47.400
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
JUST TOO BIG

19:47.400 --> 19:50.500
FOR OUR PUNY HEADS
TO COMPREHEND.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.200
WELL, IT'S STILL HALLOWEEN.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.500
I'M GONNA GO FIND
ANOTHER PARTY.
COME ON, JACK.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.400
ERIC, WAIT.

19:56.400 --> 19:58.467
EVEN AFTER ALL
THE ROTTEN THINGS
I'VE SAID TO YOU,

19:58.467 --> 20:00.834
YOU'RE STILL
GONNA INVITE ME
TO COME ALONG?

20:00.834 --> 20:03.834
OF COURSE, MAN.
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

20:03.834 --> 20:07.500
HMM. WELL,
I KNOW THAT NOW.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.567
I'M A PRETTY LUCKY
GUY, MAN.

20:09.567 --> 20:10.567
I'M BUYING.

20:10.567 --> 20:12.367
OH, YOU BETTER!

20:12.367 --> 20:15.300
YOU GOTTA LOVE
HALLOWEEN.

20:15.300 --> 20:18.100
IT REALLY BRINGS
PEOPLE TOGETHER.

20:22.133 --> 20:24.500
I LOVE THIS BALCONY.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.600
YOU DO?

20:25.600 --> 20:27.033
YEAH, IT'S GOT A GREAT
VIEW OF THE RIVER.

20:27.033 --> 20:31.000
AND YOU CAN SEE
THAT GUY WATCHING TV
IN HIS UNDERWEAR.

20:32.033 --> 20:33.867
I'VE SEEN HIM. HEH!

20:33.867 --> 20:35.467
I WAS ACTUALLY JUST
WONDERING IF...

20:35.467 --> 20:37.500
SEEING VALARIS DID
ANYTHING FOR YOU.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.800
IS THAT HIS NAME?

20:39.800 --> 20:41.567
WHY ARE YOU SO NERVOUS?

20:41.567 --> 20:43.400
I'M SORRY, SABRINA.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.467
MY BUDDY
JUST CAME OFF

20:44.467 --> 20:45.500
KIND OF A SPOOKY
RELATIONSHIP.

20:45.500 --> 20:48.000
HE WAS--HE WAS
DATING A, UH....

20:48.000 --> 20:49.600
OH, WELL,
I'LL JUST SAY IT.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.200
HE WAS DATING
A WITCH.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.867
WHAT'S SO SPOOKY
ABOUT THAT?

20:54.867 --> 20:56.033
SO WHAT'S NEXT?

20:56.033 --> 20:57.400
I DON'T KNOW. I FIGURE
MAYBE WE'LL GO GET

20:57.400 --> 20:58.567
A BITE TO EAT.
IS THAT GOOD?

20:58.567 --> 21:00.300
ALL RIGHT, COOL.
HEY, SHAWN!

21:00.300 --> 21:01.767
WANT US TO PICK YOU UP
SOMETHING, MAN?

21:01.767 --> 21:05.967
NO, THANKS! I'M FEELING
A LITTLE BLOATED.

21:08.300 --> 21:09.767
SEE YOU, SHAWN.

21:09.767 --> 21:12.233
YOU GOTTA LOVE HALLOWEEN.
