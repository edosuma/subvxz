For this tattoo, you must
freehand your design

05:27.910 --> 05:29.912
directly onto
your canvas' skin

without a stencil.

<i>- Freehanding tattoos</i>
<i>on the skin is insane.</i>

<i>it's perfectly proportioned.</i>

05:43.426 --> 05:47.388

ups the game so much.

You can tattoo any style

your mastery of proportion.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.610

06:28.346 --> 06:29.680

seem to be accurate,

27:28.271 --> 27:30.148
the face itself is gorgeous.

very dark and rich,

I really like the value

28:11.314 --> 28:12.690
in putting this Pegasus
in the background

28:12.774 --> 28:15.485
to give yourself some time to
focus on the character itself.

28:15.568 --> 28:16.820
- But that one little cloud

28:16.903 --> 28:18.696
coming off the back of
the wing, it needs more.

28:18.780 --> 28:21.241
If it's between you

28:21.324 --> 28:22.367

these unfinished areas,

28:32.252 --> 28:34.671
Where you really lose it
is in the beard.

28:34.754 --> 28:36.840
It's just
a little plate of spaghetti.

28:36.923 --> 28:38.383

Proportion being

28:51.896 --> 28:53.565
the first thing
that caught my eye

28:53.648 --> 28:56.943
was that irregular bend in the
arm holding the lightning bolt.

28:57.026 --> 28:58.528
It does look a little askew.

28:58.611 --> 29:00.655
And the hairline is very,
very close to the brow.

29:00.738 --> 29:03.116
Leaving very little forehead.

29:03.199 --> 29:05.827
- Tell me, what is going on
with this background?

29:05.910 --> 29:07.370
- I just wanted him
to be in the clouds.

29:07.454 --> 29:08.580
- If you're not going
to kill the background,

29:08.663 --> 29:09.622
the background is going
to kill your tattoo.

29:09.706 --> 29:11.916
- That's why
I hate doing backgrounds.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.334
- Then why'd
you do the background?

29:13.418 --> 29:15.086
- I was afraid
of the contrast of the bolt.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.921
- We didn't even
have a chat about background.

29:17.005 --> 29:18.423
You could have
just called me over,

29:18.506 --> 29:20.383
asked me like one question
and I would have told you.

29:20.467 --> 29:21.718
- I should have,
I should have, man.

29:21.801 --> 29:25.305
- This is tattoos for life,
you know?

29:25.388 --> 29:28.183
- Deanna.

29:28.266 --> 29:30.059
- This does not
look like you did it.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.437
The detail in the fabric,
the detail in the hair.

29:32.520 --> 29:33.480
The detail in the face.
It's pretty remedial.

29:33.563 --> 29:35.190
- His beard is literally longer

29:35.273 --> 29:39.527
than any portion of anything on
his entire long, blowing hair.

29:39.611 --> 29:40.487
It looked like
on the drawing table,

29:40.570 --> 29:42.113
it wasn't well thought out.

29:43.907 --> 29:45.742
- Let's move on
to Team Anthony.

29:45.825 --> 29:47.827
Mike.

29:48.786 --> 29:50.121
- Technically,
this tattoo is really nice.

29:50.205 --> 29:53.625
Great black, great shading.
Really clean, long outlines.

29:53.708 --> 29:54.751
- Thanks.

29:54.834 --> 29:57.003
- But her head
rocks back like this.

29:57.086 --> 29:58.713
Gives me the
underside of her nose.

29:58.796 --> 30:00.256
And the misshaped nostrils

30:00.340 --> 30:03.676
really throws the proportions
of her face off.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.263
- Juan.

30:07.347 --> 30:09.057
- Everything about
this thing is killer.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.725
The shading on it
is super smooth.

30:10.808 --> 30:12.101
But it's proportion day.

30:12.185 --> 30:13.937
Where the proportion
doesn't stand up

30:14.020 --> 30:15.230
is in the detail of the eyes.

30:15.313 --> 30:18.233
The way the nose is drawn,
the way the mouth is.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.652
It's got to compete with
the rest of the room.

30:22.153 --> 30:24.072
- Jason.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.950
- There's not a whole lot of
realistic proportion

30:27.033 --> 30:28.493
for us to judge in this tattoo.

30:28.576 --> 30:30.119
- You have a lot of issues
with your outline.

30:30.203 --> 30:31.371
It's just wavering
in thickness.

30:31.454 --> 30:32.455
It's not solid.

30:32.539 --> 30:33.790
- When we were trying
to communicate,

30:33.873 --> 30:35.375
you just shut off.

30:35.458 --> 30:39.170
I think some of that energy
came into play on this tattoo.

30:40.255 --> 30:43.091
- Amanda.

30:43.174 --> 30:44.759
- It's a much more clear,
distinctive tattoo

30:44.842 --> 30:47.136
than we've seen you do
in your last one.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.346
You have a very small face,

30:48.429 --> 30:51.266
but you still capture
the facial structure.

30:51.349 --> 30:52.767
But when you got through
some of

30:52.850 --> 30:54.727
the other musculature
of the body,

30:54.811 --> 30:57.105
those shadings aren't really
making the correct shapes.

30:57.188 --> 30:59.774
They're just making something.

31:01.609 --> 31:03.111
- Daniel.

31:03.194 --> 31:06.864
- Very dynamic, a lot of
great structure in the face.

31:06.948 --> 31:09.951
A lot of great artistic
liberties that are taken here.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.953
- The place where I lose
a little bit of proportion.

31:12.036 --> 31:14.205
The right horn
is on a way different plane

31:14.289 --> 31:15.623
than the left horn.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.250
- If that's the only parts
that are wrong with it,

31:17.333 --> 31:18.793
then I'm super stoked on it.

31:21.087 --> 31:22.547
- Linzy.

31:23.548 --> 31:24.799
- It's very 80's,
action figure-ish.

31:24.882 --> 31:27.510
Wearing those
Daisy Duke shorts.

31:27.594 --> 31:30.054
- It was going to be
like a black loincloth,

31:30.138 --> 31:31.973
and it does
kind of read as shorts.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.891
- His right leg just
seems to disappear.

31:33.975 --> 31:37.353
- The flames have
zero resemblance to fire.

31:37.437 --> 31:39.564
It shows a lack of

31:39.647 --> 31:42.108
understanding
how to draw these things.

31:42.191 --> 31:43.693
- It was just a tough day.

31:43.776 --> 31:46.237
- Take that time, slow down.
Understand what you're doing.

31:49.324 --> 31:51.659
- Okay, judges.
It is now time to determine

31:51.743 --> 31:54.537
who had the best
tattoo of the day.

31:54.621 --> 31:56.497
Josh had a big ask
with his Pegasus,

31:56.581 --> 31:57.915
he played it smart.

31:57.999 --> 32:00.543
- The top clouds by the Pegasus
kind of lose it for me.

32:00.627 --> 32:03.046
- Frank's tattoo is killer.
The hair and the face,

32:03.129 --> 32:04.213
and the way
he captured the shading.

32:04.297 --> 32:06.924

32:08.301 --> 32:09.886
My vote's for Frank.

32:09.969 --> 32:12.180

from each team to eliminate.

32:30.114 --> 32:31.991

It's tonal throughout

And then he put an

33:59.704 --> 34:02.623
- I tell him what to do,
and he doesn't do it.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.500
- Anthony, who comes to mind
when you're thinking

34:04.584 --> 34:05.960
"bottom of the pack" today?

34:06.043 --> 34:08.463
- Linzy struggled today
and it showed.

34:08.545 --> 34:10.590
- I just don't know
how you draw these flames.

34:10.672 --> 34:11.757
That is terrible.

34:11.841 --> 34:13.092
- I think Jason should be
on the bottom also.

34:13.176 --> 34:16.471
- I agree with that.
- He is a mess.

34:16.554 --> 34:19.639
- Riddled with bad lines,
sketchy shading.

34:19.724 --> 34:20.641
- Where does Amanda
fall in the line-up?

34:20.725 --> 34:22.101
- Oh.
- Oof.

34:22.185 --> 34:25.062
- She has melting legs
and no toes.

34:25.146 --> 34:26.438
- But she was coachable,
I know.

34:26.522 --> 34:27.648
- Extremely coachable.

34:27.732 --> 34:28.483
{\an3}- You told them
about Jason, right?

34:28.565 --> 34:30.359
- Is Jason coachable, Anthony?

34:30.443 --> 34:32.195

- It's okay.

34:32.277 --> 34:33.946
- I got it, I got it.
- Okay.

34:34.030 --> 34:34.822
- There was no way
I was going to let

34:34.906 --> 34:36.239
what he was drawing go on skin.

34:36.324 --> 34:39.744
I gave my two cents,
and he just stopped talking.

34:39.827 --> 34:40.911
{\an3}- Wouldn't answer
his questions.

34:40.995 --> 34:42.705
- I was asking him questions,
no response.

34:42.789 --> 34:44.040
Nothing.

34:44.123 --> 34:46.375
- Well, I'll tell you,
being in bands my whole life,

34:46.458 --> 34:47.585
the guy with
the worst attitude,

34:47.668 --> 34:49.170
no matter how good
he is, is out.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.755
- Out of the band.
- You're eliminating

34:51.839 --> 34:53.174

needs to be eliminated

34:53.257 --> 34:54.675

you have to be able to draw.

35:56.112 --> 35:57.780
Linzy, this one
is challenged heavily.

35:57.864 --> 35:59.282
You are still very stagnant,
very rigid, very tight.

36:14.797 --> 36:16.257
- Well, Amanda, this is
definitely a lot better

36:16.340 --> 36:18.593
than the last tattoos
we've seen.

36:18.676 --> 36:21.137
But there are still
some shortcomings.

36:21.220 --> 36:23.055
- I really just tried
to show proportion.

36:23.139 --> 36:24.599
That was the main goal
of the challenge.

36:24.682 --> 36:28.185
- That's a very small piece
of the entire picture.

36:28.269 --> 36:30.104
There's no room for any error.

36:30.187 --> 36:33.482
- Jason, today the technical
application puts you down here.

36:33.566 --> 36:34.859
Lot of complications
in this thing.

36:34.942 --> 36:37.612
- I let it get to me.
There is definitely a hard line

36:37.695 --> 36:40.781
between how much creativity
can you put in there

36:40.865 --> 36:42.325
versus how much challenge
do you need to meet.

36:42.408 --> 36:43.659
- This is the stuff

36:43.743 --> 36:47.496
that I tried to really
bring home and stress.

36:47.580 --> 36:49.290
- Let's move on to Team DJ.

36:49.373 --> 36:50.958
Let's start with Sparks.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.919
- I've given you
some tips and tricks and stuff,

36:53.002 --> 36:55.379
and I feel like you just
totally avoided what I said,

36:55.463 --> 36:57.298
which is
really challenging as a coach.

36:57.381 --> 36:59.008
- We let some passion fly

36:59.091 --> 37:00.676
pretty early on
in the competition.

37:00.760 --> 37:01.969
But I think that's just because

37:02.053 --> 37:03.012
we give a [bleep]
about what we're doing, man.

37:03.095 --> 37:04.347
You're right.

37:04.430 --> 37:06.641
I'd felt like I've been
asking lots of questions.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.559
And I've actually approached
this the wrong way.

37:08.643 --> 37:10.061
I'm the one that got me here.

37:10.144 --> 37:11.812
I really don't want to make
any excuses for this, man.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.731
I just had an off day.

37:13.814 --> 37:15.650
- All right,
let's move on to Lil D.

37:15.733 --> 37:18.361
- Black and gray is a real
weak point in what you do.

37:18.444 --> 37:20.404
- There's going to be
a [bleep] of black and gray.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.073
- I knew coming
into this competition,

37:22.156 --> 37:24.408
there would be days where
I would be out on a limb.

37:24.492 --> 37:27.453
But DJ helped me, and I tried
to listen as best I could.

37:27.536 --> 37:28.996
Next time I'll do it
more traditional,

37:29.080 --> 37:31.666
and stick with what I know.

37:31.749 --> 37:34.001
- I've done three tattoos
now in this competition,

37:34.085 --> 37:36.462
and I'm definitely
learning what I have to do.

37:36.545 --> 37:39.590
I feel like I'm close
to rising from the ground.

37:39.674 --> 37:40.841
- This one looks old,

37:40.925 --> 37:42.677
it doesn't look like
a brand-new tattoo.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.053
- I should have went smaller
and taken my time more,

37:44.136 --> 37:45.304
and I feel like I would have

37:45.388 --> 37:48.641
successfully
got the tones in there.

37:48.724 --> 37:49.892
- We've had two challenges,

37:49.976 --> 37:51.727
and you've been
on the bottom twice.

37:51.811 --> 37:52.561
So you need
to catch your groove,

37:52.645 --> 37:56.065
and you need to catch it fast.

37:56.148 --> 37:57.441
- All right, guys.

37:57.525 --> 37:58.943
It is time for the coaches
to make a decision

37:59.026 --> 38:01.070
as to who is going home.

38:01.153 --> 38:05.574
Anthony, what is your decision?

38:05.658 --> 38:07.326
- You already know
that I'm artistic.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.870
I have a pretty versatile bag,
and I'm definitely a fighter.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.580
- I'm going to pick apart
everything that I did wrong,

38:11.664 --> 38:14.166
and I'm going to do my
damnedest not to do it again.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.668
- I told you guys
from the beginning,

38:15.751 --> 38:17.044
I was in this with you.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.629
But this is the way it goes.

38:18.713 --> 38:22.842
Moving forward,
I need people who are flexible,

38:22.925 --> 38:26.470
who will not waver.
I need technicians.

38:26.554 --> 38:28.180
My choice is...

38:28.264 --> 38:30.099
Linzy.

38:30.182 --> 38:34.103
