00:02.460 --> 00:06.256
- Boys, you cannot just go
swimming in the neighbor's pool.

00:06.339 --> 00:08.591
- The sign said "Open House."

00:08.675 --> 00:11.010
- It's only open for people
who want to buy it.

00:11.094 --> 00:14.055
- I wanna buy it.
It comes with a free pool.

00:14.139 --> 00:16.265
Besides, I've been thinking
about getting a place of my own.

00:16.349 --> 00:17.767
- Can I come over and swim?

00:17.851 --> 00:19.686
- Call first.

00:19.769 --> 00:22.605
- When did we even
get this whale thing?

00:22.689 --> 00:26.276
- A few minutes ago
when you dragged us outta there.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.027
- You mean we stole this?

00:28.111 --> 00:31.364
- We? You're the one
holdin' it.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.199
- But, Dad, I am literally
the only person

00:33.283 --> 00:34.909
who has not seen this movie.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.870
- I haven't seen it
and I'm a person.

00:36.953 --> 00:39.122
- But you're like
a not-fun person.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.540
- I'm super fun.

00:40.623 --> 00:42.417
I put the fun in
I'm fun-damentally opposed

00:42.500 --> 00:44.544
to you seeing a scary movie--

00:44.627 --> 00:47.130
especially the way
you freak out so easily.

00:47.213 --> 00:48.923
- I do not!

00:49.007 --> 00:50.717
- Hm, the boat scene
in "Willy Wonka."

00:50.800 --> 00:54.304
- Okay, first of all,
that song is terrifying.

00:54.387 --> 00:55.597
- "Charlotte's Web."

00:55.680 --> 00:59.058
- Only thing worse than
a spider is a talking spider.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.186
- What about that one-eyed
swan in the park?

01:01.269 --> 01:04.230
- That thing looks at me
like it wants something.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.608
Look, Dad, I am not
a little kid anymore.

01:06.691 --> 01:08.693
I bet "Haunted Reckoning III"
isn't even scary.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.320
- "Haunted Reckoning III"?

01:10.403 --> 01:14.574
I heard Sally had a heart attack
just watching the commercial.

01:14.657 --> 01:17.160
- Maybe you should go
to the theater, Dad.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.828
Drum up some
cardiology business.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.122
I get the sense you have a big
real estate purchase comin' up.

01:21.206 --> 01:23.166
- James, we are not
buying that house.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.000
- What house?

01:24.083 --> 01:26.461
- Dad, I wanna go
to the movie.

01:26.544 --> 01:27.879
- The one with
the water slide.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.464
- "Haunted Reckoning III"
has a water slide?

01:29.547 --> 01:31.841
- GABBY: [sighing]
Come on, Steph, help me here.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.843
There must have
been something

01:33.927 --> 01:35.929
everyone thought
you were too young for.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.514
- Yes.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.599
But I married him anyway.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.685
- Look at this house, Dad.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.355
The master suite features
a steam shower,

01:45.438 --> 01:47.148
a skylight
and a shoe closet.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.484
- A shoe closet? Really?

01:49.567 --> 01:51.694
They got a picture?

01:51.778 --> 01:53.029
- Nobody's getting
a new house

01:53.112 --> 01:56.866
and nobody's going to
see "Haunted Reckoning III."

01:56.950 --> 01:58.701
If you guys want, later,
we can turn out the lights

01:58.785 --> 02:00.620
and watch "Willy Wonka."

02:00.703 --> 02:03.915
- "Haunted Reckoning III"
can't be that scary.

02:03.998 --> 02:07.210
It's PG-13.
- [laughing] PG-13?

02:07.293 --> 02:09.211
Charlie.
- Charlie, what?

02:09.294 --> 02:11.714
Charlie right.
- Charlie wrong.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.383
Gabby can handle it.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.510
If you're worried,
I'll take her myself.

02:15.593 --> 02:17.554
- [heavy sigh]
Okay. Fine.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.430
Gabby, you can go.
- [excited squeal]

02:19.514 --> 02:21.057
- But only if Stephanie
takes you.

02:21.140 --> 02:22.684
- Good. Now that
that's settled,

02:22.767 --> 02:24.352
I'm gonna take
the killer whale back.

02:24.435 --> 02:25.895
- I'll go with you.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.564
We can walk around the house
and kick the tires.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.524
By the way, I heard they're
selling their car.

02:29.607 --> 02:32.402
I hear the wife has
a lottery problem.

{\an8}- All right, boys, we'll be

02:55.008 --> 02:56.759
{\an8}When your movie gets out, meet
us by the video games--

02:56.843 --> 02:58.928
{\an8}in the lobby, not the arcade
down the street.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.472
{\an8}I won't make that
mistake twice.

{\an8}- I can't believe I have to sit
through "The Puppy Detective."

{\an8}- Seriously? Pay up.

03:21.868 --> 03:22.911

{\an8}A baby movie with

03:26.039 --> 03:26.915

{\an8}- All right, fine.
But stay with him.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.297
{\an8}I mean it, James.
Be responsible.

03:34.380 --> 03:38.551
{\an8}- Responsible?
That's a $2 surcharge.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.470
{\an8}- Come on, Steph,
we're gonna be late.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.305
{\an8}"Haunted Reckoning III"
is about to start.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.182
{\an8}I heard the first
five minutes are so scary

03:44.265 --> 03:45.850
{\an8}people pee their pants.

03:45.934 --> 03:46.559
I don't wanna miss that.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.646
- I kinda do.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.983
- All right, they're gone.
Now here's the plan.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.234
We wait 30 seconds,

03:55.318 --> 03:57.570
then we sneak into
"Haunted Reckoning III."

03:57.654 --> 03:59.614
- Nah, I'm good with
my puppy movie.

03:59.697 --> 04:03.826
I hear there's a great chase
scene with its tail.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.411
- Where'd you get
the 3D glasses?

04:05.495 --> 04:05.995
- Brought them from home.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.206
- This isn't a 3D movie.

04:08.289 --> 04:11.751
- It won't be for you.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.629
- 3D glasses only work
for 3D movies.

04:14.712 --> 04:16.673
You would know that--

04:16.755 --> 04:18.591
if you weren't such
a little kid.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.427
- I'm not a little kid.
- Then prove it.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.638
Let's go next door and watch
"Haunted Reckoning III."

04:23.721 --> 04:25.264
- Are there puppies in it?

04:25.348 --> 04:27.266
- There are parts of puppies.

04:27.350 --> 04:30.019
- That could work.

04:30.103 --> 04:34.232
- ♪

04:34.315 --> 04:35.692
- Well, I'm off
to the hospital.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.528
- Hold up. Before you go,
could you find me

04:38.611 --> 04:40.238
a decent Pinot noir?

04:40.321 --> 04:41.698
Because yo' stuff
is no better than

04:41.781 --> 04:44.867
the stuff I got at home.

04:44.951 --> 04:48.246
- Our stuff is what
you've got at home.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.540
Stop takin' our stuff.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.500
Hey, how were the movies?

04:52.583 --> 04:55.253
- Oh, it was so intense,
I was on the edge of my seat.

04:55.336 --> 04:57.255
- "The Puppy Detective"?

04:57.338 --> 04:59.007
- Yep, that's what
my ticket sale says.

04:59.090 --> 05:02.051
Totally loved it because
I was totally there.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.387
- I can't un-see it.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.180
- Why would you want to?
It was a delightful romp.

05:06.264 --> 05:09.475
- Well, I'm glad you
liked your movie.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.060
Mine was completely lame.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.353
- So, you weren't even
a little bit scared?

05:12.437 --> 05:14.397
- The only thing that
would make that mess scary

05:14.480 --> 05:20.236
is if I saw it in the park
next to that one-eyed swan.

05:20.319 --> 05:21.612
- I've gotta go.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.072
Thank you for sitting
through that with her.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.240
[kissing]

05:24.323 --> 05:26.451
Maggie, take it
outta your purse

05:26.534 --> 05:29.495
and put it back on the rack.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.080
- Molly is such a wuss.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.041
She was actually scared of
"Haunted Reckoning III."

05:33.124 --> 05:34.667
- Nothing wrong with Molly.
Why are you all up on Molly?

05:34.751 --> 05:37.336
Molly's got good sense.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.297
- Let me see your fingernails.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.673
- Why do you want
to see my nails?

05:40.757 --> 05:42.508
- Because, when you
get all frightened,

05:42.592 --> 05:44.427
you chew them down
to the nub.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.262
- You're right.
Steph totally freaked out

05:46.346 --> 05:49.307
and when she ran out of her
nails, she came after mine.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.267
- Uh, don't act like
I'm the weird one.

05:51.350 --> 05:54.103
You're the weird one--15 people
attacked by ghosts

05:54.187 --> 05:56.314
and you sat there
on your phone shopping for

05:56.397 --> 06:00.610
six-inch stilettos,
which, by the way, unh-unh.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.695
- I had to do something
to kill the time.

06:02.779 --> 06:06.449
You were screaming so loud,
I couldn't take a nap.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.159
- Now why would you
go see that movie

06:08.242 --> 06:10.328
when you know what
a scaredy cat you are?

06:10.411 --> 06:12.371
- Because I wanted
to prove to Charlie

06:12.455 --> 06:15.208
that Gabby could handle it
and I was right--she could.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.543
I could not.
It was terrifying.

06:17.627 --> 06:20.713
- [plate clatters]
- [gasping] What's that?

06:20.797 --> 06:23.966
- Me putting down my plate.

06:24.050 --> 06:28.888
- How many times have I told you
ghosts are not entertainment?

06:28.971 --> 06:31.641
Huh, you remember why
my family moved out of

06:31.724 --> 06:34.310
Maple Court when I was
a little girl.

06:34.393 --> 06:36.646
- Mom, don't you bring up
that cul-de-sac stuff now.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.649
- I told you--it was not
a cul-de-sac.

06:39.732 --> 06:42.819
It was a kill-de-sac.

06:42.902 --> 06:48.324
Oh, yeah, that empty house
next door was a haunted house!

06:48.407 --> 06:53.579
Doors swinging' open, shut,
weird sounds,

06:53.663 --> 06:57.250
lights flickering,
aaaaaahhhh!

06:57.333 --> 07:01.838
My mother hot-tailed
us outta there.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.173
- Okay, now is not the time
to tell that old story.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.466
There are kids in the room.

07:05.550 --> 07:09.011
- I'm good.
- Not you, me.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.222
[pouting]
Stop scaring your baby.

07:11.305 --> 07:17.186
- Aww, baby. I'll stop.

07:17.270 --> 07:22.024
But nothing could stop that
transparent little girl

07:22.108 --> 07:27.071
from playin' jacks on
the front porch every night!

07:27.155 --> 07:33.035
Onesies, twosies.
Onesies, twosies. Ooooh!

07:33.119 --> 07:35.663
- I'm not hearing
about the jacks.

07:35.746 --> 07:39.000
- "Twosies." That's what
we used to call her.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.043
- And you moved just
because of ghosts?

07:41.127 --> 07:42.879
- Oh, yeah.
- To a new house?

07:42.962 --> 07:43.754
- Heck, yeah.
- With a pool?

07:43.838 --> 07:46.382
- Heck, no.

07:46.465 --> 07:48.885
That's how Twosies died.

07:53.598 --> 07:54.724
- Aaron, I figured out

07:54.807 --> 07:57.977
how to get that house
across the street.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.562
Aaron? Aaron?

08:03.482 --> 08:04.567
What are you doing?

08:04.650 --> 08:06.986
- Hiding! Now the ghosts
know where I am.

08:07.069 --> 08:08.905
Thanks a lot!

08:08.988 --> 08:10.948
- Aaron, come on out.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.909
- Now you're telling
them my name?

08:12.992 --> 08:16.287
Some brother you are--
James Phillips!

08:16.370 --> 08:19.248
- I told you--ghosts
aren't real.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.585
- Didn't you see
"Haunted Reckoning III"?

08:22.668 --> 08:24.420
- Did you guys sneak
into that movie?

08:24.503 --> 08:26.547
- Shhh! Keep it down.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.799
- I knew I heard Aaron
screaming behind us.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.052
- How could you hear my screams
over Stephanie's?

08:31.135 --> 08:34.388
- Tell me about it.
That woman has lungs.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.514
- And thanks to Grandma Maggie,

08:35.597 --> 08:37.808
now she's twice as
freaked out about ghosts,

08:37.892 --> 08:39.644
and perfectly positioned
for us to scare her

08:39.727 --> 08:41.812
into that new house
across the street.

08:41.895 --> 08:43.397
- No way. After Steph
just had my back,

08:43.481 --> 08:45.942
I'm not gonna let you pull
some stupid ghost trick.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.860
- In the new house,
you have your own bathroom.

08:47.944 --> 08:50.446
- Okay, let's do this, y'all.
Do I need a sheet or something?

08:50.529 --> 08:51.614
- Here's what I'm thinking.

08:51.697 --> 08:54.784
Grandma Maggie told me
that Steph's already afraid

08:54.867 --> 08:57.453
of this freaky ghost kid
named Twosies.

08:57.536 --> 08:58.996
So we need to go bigger.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.624
- Threesies!

09:01.707 --> 09:04.627
- No, what if we did
something from the movie?

09:04.710 --> 09:05.878
What was the scariest part?

09:05.962 --> 09:09.131
- All of it.
Weren't you there?

09:09.215 --> 09:11.634
- You were sitting next to her.
What made her scream the most?

09:11.717 --> 09:13.261
- She didn't really
stop screaming.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.137
I guess it's a tie between
the dead kid in the mirror

09:15.221 --> 09:17.306
and the dead kid who saw
a dead kid in his mirror.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.226
- What's Stephanie's
biggest fear?

09:20.309 --> 09:23.145
- Cellulite.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.356
- Okay, so you're clearly
the worst at this.

09:25.439 --> 09:28.901
- What you got?
- Something really good.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.903
We wait till midnight.
- Uh-huh.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.989
- We borrow Aaron's wagon.
- I'm with you.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.740
- We stop by the morgue.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.575
- Let me stop you right there.

09:36.659 --> 09:39.704
- You're right.
It is uphill coming back.

09:39.787 --> 09:43.582
- We don't need an actual body.
Stephanie's already on edge.

09:43.666 --> 09:46.252
We just need to suggest a ghost.

09:46.335 --> 09:50.172
- May I suggest Casper?

09:50.256 --> 09:52.591
All with cellulite
and more and I'm the idiot?

09:59.348 --> 10:01.684
- Hello?
- [unidentified noises from TV]

10:01.767 --> 10:04.520
- Kids?

10:04.603 --> 10:08.107
Charlie, are you home?

10:08.190 --> 10:11.110
Way to, kids. Just leave
the television on all night.

10:11.193 --> 10:13.321
[turns off TV]

10:13.404 --> 10:15.031
- [unidentified noises from TV]
- [gasping]

10:15.114 --> 10:17.491
That's weird.

10:17.575 --> 10:18.909
[gasping]

10:18.993 --> 10:20.620
And that's terrifying.

10:20.703 --> 10:25.541
- [TV channels switching]
- [gasping]

10:25.625 --> 10:27.626
- [woman on TV screaming]

10:27.710 --> 10:29.837
- Ahhhh!
[turns off TV]

10:29.920 --> 10:31.630
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.257
- [glass shattering]

10:33.341 --> 10:35.426
- Not okay. Not okay.
Not okay.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.267
- [tap starts running]

10:43.351 --> 10:47.146
- [turns off tap]
- [gasping]

10:47.229 --> 10:52.234
Ahhh.
[locking door]

10:52.318 --> 10:53.402
Hm.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.530
Oh! Hey, Charlie.
Real quick. No biggie.

10:56.614 --> 10:57.865
We're sellin' the house.

10:57.948 --> 11:00.159
'Cause it's haunted, fool!

11:02.411 --> 11:04.747
- [knock at door]
- Who goes there?

11:04.830 --> 11:05.956
- Husband. Actual human being.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.417
Don't panic.

11:08.501 --> 11:12.505
Just a bat.
Not as bad as I expected.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.553
There's the woman I married.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.597
- Oh, I'm sorry, Charlie,
how would you fight a ghost?

11:21.680 --> 11:24.934
- I wouldn't--
because they're not real.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.435
- Oh, no?
Explain the television.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.271
Explain the faucet.
Explain the door.

11:29.355 --> 11:32.191
- They're parts of our house?

11:32.274 --> 11:35.986
- That move by themselves,
funny man.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.988
- I told you not
to go to that movie.

11:38.072 --> 11:38.989
- You didn't tell me,
you told Gabby,

11:39.073 --> 11:41.909
and she's next door
sleeping like a baby.

11:41.992 --> 11:42.451
Unless they took her away.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.370
Go check on Gabby!

11:44.453 --> 11:46.789
- I'm sure she's fine.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.791
Everybody else is asleep.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.459
- Ahhhhh, ghost kid!

11:50.543 --> 11:52.545
- Stephanie, where?

11:53.587 --> 11:56.674
- Look, everybody calm down.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.801
Stephanie, it's just Aaron.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.804
Aaron, it's just you.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.931
- I had a bad dream.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.767
It was that movie.
So much horror.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.561
So many bodies.

12:08.644 --> 12:09.979
- Wait a minute, Aaron,

12:10.062 --> 12:12.940
did you go see
"The Puppy Detective".

12:13.023 --> 12:15.317
- M-M-Maybe.

12:15.401 --> 12:18.237
Not.

12:18.320 --> 12:21.824
- Did you see
"Haunted Reckoning III"?

12:21.907 --> 12:23.868
- M-M-Maybe.

12:23.951 --> 12:25.494
Yes.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.205
- Did you take him
to see that movie?

12:28.289 --> 12:29.081
- Do you think I'm crazy?

12:29.165 --> 12:33.085
- Put down the bat
and ask me again.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.712
- James and I snuck in.

12:34.795 --> 12:37.465
- Aaron, you're way too young
for movies like that.

12:37.548 --> 12:38.215
- Not any more.

12:38.299 --> 12:41.594
It aged me.

12:41.677 --> 12:45.347
- Buddy, you know there's no
such thing at ghosts, right?

12:45.431 --> 12:48.350
- Except the one that's all up
in our electricity and plumbing.

12:48.434 --> 12:52.354
- Do you see how that's maybe
not helpful right now?

12:52.438 --> 12:54.940
- If the plan works, can we move
to the house with the pool?

12:55.024 --> 12:57.860
Because I wanna
get out of here.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.863
- The plan?
- The house with the pool?

13:00.946 --> 13:03.199
- Oops.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.451
- James.
- The ghost...

13:05.534 --> 13:07.453
that was doing all
that stuff downstairs.

13:07.536 --> 13:11.582
That was James?
- Classic James.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.375
- There is no way he did that
whole thing by himself.

13:13.459 --> 13:16.170
I mean, it was elaborate.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.130
He must have had
help from Gabby.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.840
- Well, to get you up here
with half the toolshed,

13:19.924 --> 13:22.676
those two kids must have pulled
off a work of genius.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.554
- Uh, you have three kids.

13:25.638 --> 13:29.558
- Oh, we know, buddy.
You're our special guy.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.727
Boy, when Gabby and James
join forces,

13:31.810 --> 13:33.854
those two can be devious.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.189
- Hey, I'm devious, too.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.690
- Hang on, Aaron.

13:36.774 --> 13:39.109
You know what stings the most?
- Hm.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.319
- I stood up for Gabby

13:40.402 --> 13:41.445
and took her to that movie
in the first place.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.573
And this is how she repays me,
the little traitor.

13:44.657 --> 13:48.953
- Hello! I'm
the little traitor.

13:49.036 --> 13:52.164
She's the big traitor.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.876
- And how was everyone's
evening?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.170
Anything go bump in the night?

13:58.254 --> 14:00.256
- Your butt's about to.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.383
We know what you did.
- Me? What did I do?

14:02.466 --> 14:04.635
- One count of sneaking
into a horror movie,

14:04.718 --> 14:06.762
one count of terrifying
your little brother,

14:06.845 --> 14:09.598
and one count of maliciously
pranking Stephanie.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.308
Did I miss anything?

14:11.392 --> 14:13.477
- Run, Gabby,
our plan failed!

14:13.561 --> 14:15.813
- Unh-unh. Don't even.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.940
We know it was all of you.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.316
- I'm sorry, guys, I cracked.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.111
- Thanks a lot, Aaron.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.862
- What is wrong
with you children?

14:23.946 --> 14:30.119
You do not play fast and loose
with the spirit world, unh-unh.

14:30.202 --> 14:34.039
You open that door
and they'll come rushin' in

14:34.123 --> 14:35.791
and start messin'
with your lives.

14:35.874 --> 14:39.253
- Don't worry, Mom,
we're closing that door.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.297
You kids are grounded
for a week.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.464
- You can ground children,

14:42.548 --> 14:47.886
but you can't ground
what won't stay in the ground.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.139
- Maggie, we're done with this.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.141
- Okay, so if I'm in trouble,

14:52.224 --> 14:55.060
that means you think
that I'm devious, right?

14:55.144 --> 14:57.146
- Sweetie, we know you
were just a pawn

14:57.229 --> 14:58.981
in their little game.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.816
- I'm not just a pawn.

15:00.899 --> 15:02.484
Wait, which one is the pawn?

15:02.568 --> 15:03.694
Is it the little one
or is it the horse?

15:03.777 --> 15:08.657
Because I'm going
to be the horse.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.619
- [blender whirring]

15:11.702 --> 15:15.164
- [turns off blender]
That's it.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.081
No more of these dumb pranks.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.709
Now you two are grounded
for two weeks.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.085
- That wasn't me. James?

15:20.169 --> 15:21.337
- It wasn't me.
I'm sitting right here.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.965
- Mm-hm. See?

15:25.049 --> 15:27.301
You started something.

15:27.384 --> 15:31.347
Oh, you sent the spirit
world an invitation

15:31.430 --> 15:34.433
and now they have
come a-callin'.

15:34.516 --> 15:38.354
Ohhhh, I'm out!

15:38.437 --> 15:39.897
- [door slamming]
- Nobody panic.

15:39.980 --> 15:44.068
I'm sure there's a logical
explanation for this.

15:44.151 --> 15:47.237
- Like what? The ghosts
want a smoothie?

15:47.321 --> 15:48.197
- It's an old blender.

15:48.280 --> 15:51.325
Or maybe it's something
with the outlet.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.535
- Or maybe it's Twosies.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.828
- Can we please not go
back to that nonsense.

15:54.912 --> 15:58.457
There's no such
thing as ghosts.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.959
- [blender whirring]
- CHARLIE: [gasping]

16:03.921 --> 16:05.923
- Charlie, I'm telling you--
there's no reason to stay here

16:06.006 --> 16:07.925
when there's a perfectly good
house across the street--

16:08.008 --> 16:11.762
with a pool, a shoe closet,
and no ghosts.

16:11.845 --> 16:14.223
- Oh. Our house is not haunted.
- Careful, Dad.

16:14.306 --> 16:19.061
In the movies, it's always
the skeptic who gets it first.

16:19.144 --> 16:19.937
- [door thuds open]

16:20.020 --> 16:22.940
- GABBY, AARON, JAMES:
[screaming]

16:23.023 --> 16:24.817
- GABBY: What's that?

16:24.900 --> 16:27.611
- Hi, hi, hi.

16:27.695 --> 16:30.572
- Was she always this scary?

16:30.656 --> 16:33.200
- Yes.

16:33.283 --> 16:36.745
- Family, I want to
introduce everyone

16:36.829 --> 16:39.373
to Professor Ian Howser.

16:39.456 --> 16:40.916
He's a doctor of
paranormal activity.

16:40.999 --> 16:43.919
- And I'm a doctor
of flubity-dubity.

16:44.002 --> 16:47.089
Whatever you're selling,
we're not buying.

16:47.172 --> 16:47.840
- Whoa, Charlie,
this is a chance for us

16:47.923 --> 16:50.509
to get to the bottom of this.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.720
- Yes, I always wondered
who bought this house.

16:52.803 --> 16:55.264
Did the real estate agent
disclose its history?

16:55.347 --> 16:57.558
- Well, they told us
about the plumbing.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.810
- Yes, this neighborhood
was the site

16:59.893 --> 17:03.480
of The Great Inferno
of 1897, as you know.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.858
- As who knows?
Don't nobody know.

17:05.941 --> 17:07.693
- This property was
the epicenter

17:07.776 --> 17:10.529
of an horrific circus fire.

17:10.612 --> 17:14.366
- Ohhhh, a circus fire.

17:14.450 --> 17:18.746
Oh, that's the worst
kind of fire of all.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.457
You're sittin' there
enjoyin' yourself,

17:21.540 --> 17:23.666
eatin' cotton candy.

17:23.751 --> 17:27.671
Then, all of a sudden,
whoosh!

17:27.755 --> 17:30.632
Flames!

17:30.716 --> 17:33.135
It's all there.
The doctor researched it for me.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.178
- Yes, it was quite awful.

17:34.261 --> 17:38.098
The animals were stampeding.
The tent ignited.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.349
And, try as he might,

17:39.433 --> 17:41.143
the poor fire-eater
just couldn't keep up.

17:41.226 --> 17:44.396
- Is it just me or is
it getting hot in here?

17:44.480 --> 17:45.981
- I'm sweating.
- Me, too.

17:46.064 --> 17:48.567
- Do you think it's the fire?
- I know it's the fire.

17:48.650 --> 17:49.818
- Yes, that does make
absolute sense.

17:49.902 --> 17:53.363
You see, this house was situated
where the center ring was,

17:53.447 --> 17:58.577
which means that the clowns
would have burnt to a crisp.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.162
Right...
- [gadget beeping]

18:00.245 --> 18:01.997
- ...around...

18:02.080 --> 18:04.416
- [rapid beeping]
- Here.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.668
- You mean we're
haunted by crispy clowns?

18:06.752 --> 18:09.004
- DR. HOWSER: Wait, nobody move!
- What? Why?

18:09.087 --> 18:12.007
- I'm getting a very
intense vibration.

18:12.090 --> 18:14.176
Oh, it feels rather good.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.011
The energy is building.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.765
I think we're seconds away
from a spirit materializing.

18:19.848 --> 18:23.352
- [circus music]
- GABBY & JAMES: [screaming]

18:23.435 --> 18:25.729
We're sorry!
We're sorry!

18:25.813 --> 18:26.522
- I'm getting a very
powerful reading.

18:26.605 --> 18:27.731
It says...it says...

18:27.815 --> 18:30.025
- GABBY & JAMES: [cringing]

18:30.108 --> 18:32.152
- CHARLIE, STEPH, MAGGIE:
We got you, suckers!

18:37.950 --> 18:42.621
- You guys did this?
- To children?

18:42.704 --> 18:46.542
- I helped 'cause
I'm devious.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.127
- Turning up the thermostat
was my idea.

18:49.211 --> 18:53.090
- And I borrowed this
thing-a-ma-jig from the ICU.

18:53.173 --> 18:53.924
- What is that anyway?

18:54.007 --> 18:56.677
- Uh, you don't wanna know.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.179
But I've got 12 hours
to plug it back in.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.597
- Wait, so if the fire was fake,

19:00.681 --> 19:01.890
then there are definitely
no burnt clowns, right?

19:01.974 --> 19:05.519
- No burnt clowns.
We promise.

19:05.602 --> 19:06.562
- You were fantastic.

19:06.645 --> 19:10.399
- Well, you know, I do
a lot of dinner theater.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.234
- What? He was a fake?

19:12.317 --> 19:13.694
- Everything was a fake.

19:13.777 --> 19:15.153
- How'd you do the music and the
lights and the temperature?

19:15.237 --> 19:19.241
- I had the whole house wired
to Maggie's tablet.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.450
It can control everything.

19:20.534 --> 19:21.910
- The whole house, you say?
- Mm-hm.

19:21.994 --> 19:25.372
And don't you dare
file that away for later.
