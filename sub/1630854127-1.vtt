Okay, what do you wanna show me?

19:45.601 --> 19:47.728
I mean, you want
to take some photos, right?

19:48.478 --> 19:49.521
Huh?

19:51.690 --> 19:53.442
But you gotta put that knife down.

19:54.401 --> 19:55.402
Okay?

C'mon, man. You're scaring me.

Get the camera.

20:56.880 --> 20:57.965
It's in the bedroom.

21:04.972 --> 21:05.973
Go get it.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.660
I wanna watch the movie now.

We'll watch the movie first, but I want
to take some nudes, all right?

22:54.247 --> 22:56.583
That's why you brought me here, right?
All right.

Hey, you know.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.334
I don't like horror movies, honey.

23:40.502 --> 23:41.545
They scare me.

23:57.644 --> 23:58.895
What's so scary?

24:03.191 --> 24:04.151
Death is, uh…

24:06.027 --> 24:07.487
just a part of life.

24:17.247 --> 24:18.290
[gasps softly]

24:30.802 --> 24:31.803
Why you so nervous?

24:31.887 --> 24:32.888
I'm not.

24:36.766 --> 24:39.269
Are you scared of the movie
or are you scared of me?

24:39.853 --> 24:40.687
Uh…

24:42.772 --> 24:43.773
The movie.

24:45.442 --> 24:46.651
It's a scary movie.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.122
Am I weird?

25:02.834 --> 25:03.752
No.

25:05.962 --> 25:07.672
No, you're not weird. [chuckles]

25:24.814 --> 25:25.899
Okay.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.198
So,

25:34.407 --> 25:35.742

25:37.661 --> 25:39.496

35:58.114 --> 36:00.241

36:03.995 --> 36:05.788

36:05.872 --> 36:10.376
I called y'all, and I told you
over and over a million times

36:10.459 --> 36:12.920
that something was going on,
and you know what you did?

36:13.004 --> 36:14.964
Y'all did nothing!

36:15.047 --> 36:17.508
So what did y'all find in there? Huh?

Okay. Okay, okay.

36:48.664 --> 36:49.665

37:45.096 --> 37:46.264

37:47.974 --> 37:51.936
Mr. Dahmer, I'm Detective Kennedy
with the Milwaukee Police Department.

37:52.019 --> 37:53.604
This is Detective Murphy.

37:53.688 --> 37:56.357
We're going to apologize
in advance, Mr. Dahmer.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.026
This is likely
to be a difficult conversation.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.737
Okay. But Jeff's alive?

38:01.821 --> 38:02.655
Yes.

38:02.738 --> 38:05.241
Jeffrey was arrested late last night.

38:06.701 --> 38:07.910
Arrested? For what?

38:07.994 --> 38:08.995
Attempted murder.

38:09.078 --> 38:11.664
We'd just like
to ask you some questions about him.

38:11.747 --> 38:12.665
Murder?

38:13.791 --> 38:14.667
Wha--?

38:18.587 --> 38:20.798
When you said
there was a murder investigation,

38:20.881 --> 38:24.677
I thought someone
might have tried to murder him.

38:37.982 --> 38:39.400
Well, he was always a…

38:43.863 --> 38:45.448
He was a strange boy.

38:47.575 --> 38:50.244
But he was a quiet boy. He was a good boy.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.834
When his mother and I divorced,
it was very hard on him.

39:00.838 --> 39:03.466
He just turned 18.
He was living alone at the time.

39:04.925 --> 39:06.469
And I think being alone…

39:11.682 --> 39:13.142
is very difficult for him.

39:16.062 --> 39:18.522
I'm sorry. [clears throat]
I'm sorry for becoming emotional.

39:18.606 --> 39:19.940
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.652
[exhales emotionally]

39:28.199 --> 39:30.451
Is there anything else
you'd like to tell us?

39:35.956 --> 39:36.916
[sighs]

39:37.416 --> 39:38.626
[clicks tongue] Mm-hmm.

39:40.795 --> 39:43.297
When he was young, I think he was four,

39:44.215 --> 39:45.883
he had a hernia operation.

39:47.510 --> 39:49.512
And he was never the same after that.

39:50.930 --> 39:53.015
And I don't know if

39:54.350 --> 39:59.647
there was brain damage
from, you know, too much anesthesia.

40:03.192 --> 40:04.193
It's haunted me.

40:04.276 --> 40:06.028
[Murphy] A hernia operation?

40:06.821 --> 40:09.865
You think that it might have, what?

40:11.659 --> 40:12.785
Damaged him?

40:17.790 --> 40:20.251
Could you tell me
a little bit about what he did?

40:21.252 --> 40:22.253
Um…

40:23.337 --> 40:27.383
Who this person was
that he tried to kill, I guess.

40:30.094 --> 40:32.638
You're aware
that your son is homosexual, yes?

40:41.147 --> 40:44.650
Allegedly, he lured a man back
to his apartment and tried to kill him.

40:45.526 --> 40:46.861
Uh, the man got away,

40:46.944 --> 40:50.990
and when the police arrived
to arrest your son,

40:52.241 --> 40:53.742
well, they found various

40:55.244 --> 40:58.664
items around the apartment that indicate

40:59.623 --> 41:01.959
that your son
has committed multiple murders.

41:04.336 --> 41:05.212
Wha--

41:06.589 --> 41:09.300
What items? What…
What are you talking about?

41:11.469 --> 41:14.346
[Murphy clears throat]
I'm just gonna tell you right now,

41:14.430 --> 41:17.266
this is gonna be difficult
to hear, Mr. Dahmer.

41:21.145 --> 41:24.356
There was a human head
in his refrigerator.

41:29.862 --> 41:32.448
Two plastic bags in the freezer.

41:34.116 --> 41:36.202
Each containing a human heart.

41:36.994 --> 41:40.331
Another containing a set
of male genitalia.

41:46.295 --> 41:47.338
In the bedroom,

41:48.172 --> 41:50.883
there was five more skulls.

41:53.177 --> 41:56.013
Knives and hammers and saws

41:56.096 --> 42:00.184
and Polaroids
documenting the dismemberments.

42:01.185 --> 42:04.730
In another drawer,
we found a complete human skeleton,

42:04.813 --> 42:06.524
the bones had been bleached.

42:07.066 --> 42:08.984
A dried scalp.

42:09.068 --> 42:12.488
And then a 57-gallon vat.

42:14.698 --> 42:16.033
Filled with acid.

42:17.743 --> 42:20.037
Inside were three torsos

42:21.330 --> 42:24.083
in various stages of decomposition,

42:24.166 --> 42:26.835
as well as other body parts

42:26.919 --> 42:32.132
that he was attempting to dissolve or…

42:34.885 --> 42:37.263
strip the tissue off the bones.

42:39.265 --> 42:40.266
We don't know.

42:42.810 --> 42:46.564
And, uh, we should just tell you

42:46.647 --> 42:51.277
that based on debris
on some of the cooking utensils we found

42:51.360 --> 42:55.197
and the marks on some of the body parts,

42:55.281 --> 42:58.242
as well as things
your son mentioned to us,

42:58.993 --> 43:00.244
we believe…

43:02.246 --> 43:04.081
he ate some of his victims.

43:08.752 --> 43:12.006
[Kennedy] Now, we realize
that this is a lot for you to process.

43:12.506 --> 43:15.092
So we're gonna leave you alone
for a few minutes

43:15.175 --> 43:16.969
to, uh, collect yourself.

43:18.178 --> 43:20.389
And then, when you're ready,

43:21.223 --> 43:22.808
we can keep talking.

43:56.342 --> 43:57.593
[sighs]

43:58.469 --> 43:59.637
[sobs]

44:03.932 --> 44:05.142
[sobs]

44:12.900 --> 44:13.984
[choked sob]

44:22.034 --> 44:24.745
[reporter 2 on TV] Some neighbors here
had complained of a stench

44:24.828 --> 44:25.871
for almost a year,

44:25.954 --> 44:28.832
but they never imagined
what might be causing it.

44:28.916 --> 44:31.543
Milwaukee police were led
to an apartment in this building

44:31.627 --> 44:34.588
after they were flagged down
by a handcuffed man

44:34.672 --> 44:36.548
who claimed he'd been attacked.

44:36.632 --> 44:40.094
What they discovered upon their arrival
was almost unspeakable.

44:40.177 --> 44:43.472
Numerous pieces
from as many as 15 human bodies.

44:43.555 --> 44:47.142
[man on TV] It's obvious that there
has been a number of human specimens

44:47.226 --> 44:49.728
-found within the apartment…
-[dog barking]

44:49.812 --> 44:52.606
…and to a certain extent,
they're hidden in there.

44:52.690 --> 44:55.317
[reporter 3] A hazardous materials team,
breathing from air tanks,

44:55.401 --> 44:58.237
confiscated a number of items
from the suspect's apartment.

44:58.320 --> 45:00.989
Among them, they say,
photographs and drawings

45:01.073 --> 45:04.284
of dead, mutilated bodies
and a vat of acid.

45:04.368 --> 45:08.455
Police believe the suspect may have used
the acid to dissolve body parts.

45:08.539 --> 45:10.541
-Neighbors also say they…
-[police siren blaring]

45:12.626 --> 45:15.337
-[people clamoring]
-[siren continues]

45:30.227 --> 45:32.271
[loud banging on door]

45:35.524 --> 45:37.693
[cop] Ma'am,
you have to leave the premises.

45:37.776 --> 45:42.072
We're asking all residents to evacuate
for our investigation and their safety.

45:42.156 --> 45:43.824
Wha-- What?

45:45.534 --> 45:47.369
Wait a minute. [scoffs]

45:47.453 --> 45:49.830
Where exactly am I supposed to go?

45:49.913 --> 45:51.915
The entire building's a crime scene.

45:52.499 --> 45:55.127
There's toxic chemicals
in here that could be a hazard.

45:56.336 --> 45:57.254
Wait.

45:59.465 --> 46:01.133
How many did you find?

46:04.011 --> 46:10.768
[eerie music playing]
