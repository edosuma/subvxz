00:00.483 --> 00:02.186
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> The Big Bang Theory...

00:02.286 --> 00:05.750
There's no point in dwelling on it.
As the Vulcans say,

00:05.850 --> 00:09.618
<i>"Kup-fun-tor</i>
<i>ha'kiv na'ish Du stau."</i>

00:10.520 --> 00:13.088
Do you know what that means?
No.

00:13.090 --> 00:14.323
Are you telling the truth?

00:14.325 --> 00:16.091
<i>Nersh.</i>

00:17.727 --> 00:20.162
This is ridiculous-- being upset
about Amy all the time

00:20.164 --> 00:21.363
isn't accomplishing anything.

00:21.365 --> 00:23.265
If I want to resolve
this situation,

00:23.267 --> 00:24.867
then I need to take action.

00:24.869 --> 00:27.102
What are you gonna do?
I'm going to find her

00:27.104 --> 00:28.204
and ask her to marry me.

00:28.206 --> 00:29.872
And if she says yes,

00:29.874 --> 00:32.540
we can put this behind us
and resume our relationship.

00:32.543 --> 00:34.109
And if she says no...

00:34.111 --> 00:37.546
well, then she
can just <i>ponfo miran.</i>

00:40.083 --> 00:42.251
He didn't mean that.

01:05.842 --> 01:08.711
I think it's so adorable you're
making Sheldon breakfast.

01:08.713 --> 01:10.779
Well, he's having
a rough time.

01:10.781 --> 01:12.181
Amy broke his heart,

01:12.183 --> 01:15.284
the DVR cut off the last minute
of <i>Doctor Who...</i>

01:15.286 --> 01:17.987
that crow followed him home.

01:19.489 --> 01:22.458
Aren't you worried you're making
French toast on oatmeal day?

01:22.460 --> 01:25.027
Ah, well, what's this?
A pot of oatmeal?

01:25.029 --> 01:29.064
Or, thanks to you, what
I will now call "gloatmeal."

01:29.066 --> 01:32.134
Oh, I don't want credit
for that.

01:33.136 --> 01:34.937
Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter,

01:34.939 --> 01:37.106
lovely to see you
this fine morning.

01:37.108 --> 01:38.173
You're in a good mood.

01:38.175 --> 01:39.441
Yeah, I am indeed.

01:39.443 --> 01:40.910
I have decided,

01:40.912 --> 01:42.945
instead of wallowing
in sadness about Amy,

01:42.947 --> 01:46.215
it is time that I find myself
a new female companion.

01:46.217 --> 01:47.416
Oh. Good for you.

01:47.418 --> 01:48.918
What brought this on?

01:48.920 --> 01:51.287
I realized something--
when Amy was in my life,

01:51.289 --> 01:53.656
I was hyper-focused on my work
and ignored her.

01:53.658 --> 01:54.823
And you don't want

01:54.825 --> 01:56.892
to make the same mistake
with the next woman.

01:56.894 --> 01:59.495
No, I need a <i>new</i> woman
in my life to ignore

01:59.497 --> 02:01.797
so I can hyper-focus
on my work again.

02:01.799 --> 02:04.066
Hey, I made
French toast sticks.

02:04.068 --> 02:05.534
On oatmeal day?

02:05.536 --> 02:07.970
Ah, I also made oatmeal.
Ooh,

02:07.972 --> 02:10.973
that's a lot of carbohydrates
for a man on the prowl.

02:10.975 --> 02:13.042
You know what?
You eat it; you're married--

02:13.044 --> 02:15.411
it doesn't matter
what you look like.

02:16.613 --> 02:20.516
Don't take advice from a man
who threw his shoe at a crow.

02:50.832 --> 02:52.833
Thank you for coming by,
gentlemen.

02:52.835 --> 02:54.535
No problem.
So what's up?

02:54.537 --> 02:58.005
Well, it was the two of you who
found Amy Farrah Fowler for me.

02:58.007 --> 02:59.973
Now that I'm looking
for my next girlfriend,

02:59.975 --> 03:03.544
it seemed only logical that I
employ your services once again.

03:03.546 --> 03:06.346
Y-You sure you're up for that?
She did hurt you.

03:06.348 --> 03:09.249
Oh, no, it's all right.
I think of my time with Amy

03:09.251 --> 03:12.886
as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum:
sweet and enjoyable at first,

03:12.888 --> 03:16.557
but ultimately
a flavorless lump of sadness.

03:17.559 --> 03:19.359
You're not wrong
about Fruit Stripe.

03:19.361 --> 03:22.729
I-I was always
a Hubba Bubba man. Mm.

03:22.731 --> 03:25.866
Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble?
You're crazy.

03:25.868 --> 03:28.969
Hey, the jaw wants
what it wants.

03:28.971 --> 03:30.671
Gentlemen!

03:30.673 --> 03:32.573
Oh, right, uh, girlfriend. Okay.

03:32.575 --> 03:34.174
But what are you
looking for?

03:34.176 --> 03:35.542
All I'm looking for

03:35.544 --> 03:38.145
is an educated, intelligent
woman who shares my interests

03:38.147 --> 03:40.147
while retaining
her own unique point of view.

03:40.149 --> 03:41.315
She should be kind,

03:41.317 --> 03:42.449
patient,

03:42.451 --> 03:43.817
and most important,

03:43.819 --> 03:47.955
unable to imagine life
without me by 10:00 tonight.

03:47.957 --> 03:49.957
Isn't that
a little unreasonable?

03:49.959 --> 03:51.425
All right, fine,
she doesn't need

03:51.427 --> 03:54.628
her own point of view.
Now, chop-chop.

03:55.730 --> 03:57.631
Come on, Amy,
show us the dress.

03:57.633 --> 03:59.032
AMY:
Okay.

03:59.034 --> 04:03.637
But I'm really stepping outside
of my comfort zone here.

04:09.544 --> 04:10.878
Uh...

04:10.880 --> 04:13.981
I don't think any of your
comfort zones are showing.

04:13.983 --> 04:15.482
Yeah,

04:15.484 --> 04:17.684
it's your third date-- maybe
you could go more sexy.

04:17.685 --> 04:21.788
Well, some people think
the sexiest organ is the brain.

04:21.790 --> 04:23.757
No one ever bought me drinks
at a bar

04:23.759 --> 04:26.793
because my brain
just popped out of my shirt.

04:26.795 --> 04:28.529
Do you have any heels
higher than this?

04:28.531 --> 04:29.696
He's pretty tall.

04:29.698 --> 04:31.064
Ooh.
Ooh, tall!

04:31.066 --> 04:33.200
Finally some details
about this mystery man.

04:33.202 --> 04:34.935
Yeah, come on,
tell us more.

04:34.937 --> 04:37.404
Well, I told you his name
and that he's tall.

04:37.406 --> 04:38.672
What more do you need?

04:38.674 --> 04:39.940
Did you kiss him yet?

04:39.942 --> 04:42.376
Just a little peck on the lips.

04:42.378 --> 04:44.444
(both squeal)

04:46.180 --> 04:48.315
Well, we're your best friends--
give us one more detail

04:48.317 --> 04:49.917
and we promise
we'll leave you alone.

04:49.919 --> 04:51.718
Fine. Um...

04:51.720 --> 04:53.554
he's British.

04:53.556 --> 04:55.222
(both squeal)

04:56.157 --> 04:59.126
(chuckling):
All right, that is a juicy one.

04:59.128 --> 05:01.628
All right, where is
Tall British Dave taking you?

05:01.630 --> 05:04.331
Tea and basketball?

05:04.333 --> 05:06.567
To that new Italian place
on Walnut.

05:06.569 --> 05:07.701
Oh, nice.

05:07.703 --> 05:09.536
I'm gonna go look for other shoes.
Good luck.

05:09.538 --> 05:11.972
I threw out all my tall ones
when I married Leonard.

05:14.142 --> 05:15.509
Hey, you want

05:15.511 --> 05:17.778
to swing by that place tonight
and get a look at this guy?

05:17.780 --> 05:20.047
We don't even know what time
they're gonna be there.

05:20.049 --> 05:21.381
I'll just call the restaurant,

05:21.383 --> 05:23.150
pretend I'm Amy
and check the reservation.

05:23.152 --> 05:25.619
Damn, you're sneaky.

05:25.621 --> 05:27.888
Yeah, but I'm little,
so it's adorable.

05:30.892 --> 05:33.760
I think the quickest way
to find you a new girlfriend

05:33.762 --> 05:37.230
is just to get you on every
dating Web site out there.

05:37.232 --> 05:38.565
Are you sure?

05:38.567 --> 05:40.968
I've heard that on those
sites, often when you think

05:40.970 --> 05:43.503
you're corresponding with someone,
it's actually a computer program

05:43.505 --> 05:45.539
pretending to be
a real person.

05:45.541 --> 05:49.076
And you're afraid
it'll do a better job than you?

05:49.078 --> 05:51.244
Excuse me.

05:51.246 --> 05:52.245
No one does a better job

05:52.247 --> 05:54.081
pretending to be a person
than I do.

05:55.183 --> 05:58.352
Siri comes close,
but I know more jokes.

05:58.354 --> 06:00.854
If you don't want to
use dating Web sites,

06:00.856 --> 06:02.189
what do you suggest?

06:02.191 --> 06:04.691
Off the top of my head?
Uh, prospective women

06:04.693 --> 06:07.160
weed themselves out
in a battle of wits

06:07.162 --> 06:08.695
until only one champion remains,

06:08.697 --> 06:11.665
she shows up at my door flush
with the thrill of victory,

06:11.667 --> 06:15.736
and then sits quietly by my side
while I watch <i>Daredevil.</i>

06:15.738 --> 06:19.039
You seriously think women
would fight for you?

06:19.041 --> 06:23.176
People compete for jobs
and trophies-- why not me?

06:23.178 --> 06:25.712
He's right-- he knows
a lot of jokes.

06:26.948 --> 06:29.383
Yeah-- no, but it is
basic human nature.

06:29.385 --> 06:33.186
If we present him as a prize,
maybe they would.

06:33.188 --> 06:34.888
Well, he's smart,

06:34.890 --> 06:36.657
he's a respected
scientist...

06:36.659 --> 06:40.560
<i>And</i> I have
the soulful eyes of a cow.

06:42.630 --> 06:44.698
I don't know
if I'd say you...

06:44.700 --> 06:46.500
Oh.

06:47.468 --> 06:48.802
I have an idea.

06:48.804 --> 06:51.571
What if we put a post
on Craigslist that says:

06:51.573 --> 06:54.474
"World-class Caltech physicist
seeking girlfriend.

06:54.476 --> 06:55.809
"If interested,

06:55.811 --> 06:59.112
solve the following puzzles
for a chance to meet him."

06:59.114 --> 07:00.814
Oh, we'll make the puzzles
extremely challenging

07:00.816 --> 07:02.849
to eliminate
unworthy candidates.

07:02.851 --> 07:05.218
Oh, we could set it up
like a scavenger hunt where

07:05.220 --> 07:08.055
the last puzzle gives the winner
Sheldon's contact information.

07:08.057 --> 07:10.490
Well, this is actually an
interesting social experiment.

07:10.492 --> 07:12.359
I'm a little jealous of the
people who get to do it.

07:12.361 --> 07:13.360
Me, too.

07:13.362 --> 07:15.195
And we've seen the prize.

07:19.233 --> 07:21.535
I don't understand why we're
leaving so early for the movie.

07:21.537 --> 07:23.737
Oh, I forgot to tell you--
we're gonna meet up

07:23.739 --> 07:25.865
with Bernadette to spy
on Amy and her date.

07:25.889 --> 07:26.607
What?

07:26.608 --> 07:28.175
I don't want to do that.

07:28.177 --> 07:29.976
What, and you think I
want to see a documentary

07:29.978 --> 07:31.945
about aluminum can
recycling?

07:31.947 --> 07:33.346
This is the movie

07:33.348 --> 07:36.283
Big Soda doesn't
want you to see.

07:36.285 --> 07:39.753
No, it's the movie your wife
doesn't want you to see.

07:40.621 --> 07:42.089
So you're actually okay

07:42.091 --> 07:44.024
with invading
your friend's privacy?

07:44.026 --> 07:46.359
You're not curious
who she's out with?

07:46.361 --> 07:47.694
Not really.

07:47.696 --> 07:50.897
But you're curious
about aluminum cans.

07:51.899 --> 07:54.134
You're a weird
little guy.

07:56.904 --> 07:59.873
That's it. The Sheldon Cooper
Girlfriend Challenge

07:59.875 --> 08:02.342
is officially alive.
(chuckles)

08:02.344 --> 08:04.077
Congratulations.
This is exciting.

08:04.079 --> 08:05.245
Right now,

08:05.247 --> 08:07.447
somewhere, a woman
is dividing the atomic weight

08:07.449 --> 08:09.983
of the best noble gas
by the number of colors

08:09.985 --> 08:12.986
in the oldest national flag still in use...
W-- then using

08:12.988 --> 08:15.388
that number as the average speed
to calculate the travel time

08:15.390 --> 08:17.390
from Mordor to the Shire.
And...

08:17.392 --> 08:19.693
taking her first step
towards a lifetime

08:19.695 --> 08:23.463
of laughter,
love and, best of all, rules.

08:23.465 --> 08:26.491
I-I hope we didn't make
the puzzles <i>too</i> hard.

08:26.492 --> 08:29.804
Well... if she can solve them,
it'll prove she's intelligent,

08:29.805 --> 08:31.605
tenacious and...
so socially awkward

08:31.607 --> 08:34.274
she has nothing better to do
on a Saturday night.

08:36.043 --> 08:38.945
Golly, she sounds
too good to be true.

08:41.349 --> 08:43.283
This is fun.
I haven't dated much

08:43.284 --> 08:45.018
since my divorce.

08:45.020 --> 08:47.087
Well, I'm having
a good time, too.

08:47.089 --> 08:50.223
If you don't mind me asking, why
did you and your wife split up?

08:50.225 --> 08:52.826
Oh, you know how it is--
we wanted different things.

08:52.828 --> 08:54.094
I wanted children,

08:54.096 --> 08:57.397
and she wanted a pastry chef
named Jean-Philippe.

08:57.399 --> 09:00.000
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

09:00.002 --> 09:01.635
No, it's-it's fine.
It's why I left England.

09:01.637 --> 09:03.370
It reminded me
too much of her.

09:03.372 --> 09:08.208
Cold, gloomy and easily accessed
by a Frenchman through a tunnel.

09:09.677 --> 09:11.978
Hey. So, where are they?

09:11.980 --> 09:14.114
Across the street,
in the left window.

09:14.116 --> 09:15.782
PENNY:
Oh, damn it,

09:15.784 --> 09:17.350
we should have brought
binoculars.

09:17.352 --> 09:19.786
Right here.

09:19.788 --> 09:22.322
We just happen to have those
in the car?

09:22.324 --> 09:23.857
Kinda. Before I met Howie,

09:23.859 --> 09:26.326
I liked to keep close tabs
on my boyfriends.

09:26.328 --> 09:27.794
By stalking them?

09:27.796 --> 09:29.896
No. Stalkers
are creepy.

09:29.898 --> 09:31.798
I'm just a harmless little girl

09:31.800 --> 09:34.534
with military-grade
spy equipment.

09:35.469 --> 09:36.837
PENNY:
Oh, there he is.

09:36.839 --> 09:38.171
BERNADETTE:
He's cute, right?

09:38.173 --> 09:40.540
Yeah!
Can I see?

09:40.542 --> 09:43.491
What, now you're interested?
You didn't even want to come.

09:43.492 --> 09:47.348
I know, but you guys make being
a crappy friend look fun.

09:47.349 --> 09:49.449
Fine.

09:49.451 --> 09:51.685
LEONARD:
Yeah, okay, I see him.

09:51.687 --> 09:53.286
It looks like
they're having a nice time.

09:53.288 --> 09:54.588
I wish I could hear
what they're saying.

09:54.590 --> 09:55.856
Yeah, I should've brought

09:55.858 --> 09:57.023
my parabolic microphone.

09:57.025 --> 09:59.092
Your what?
Nothing. Not important.

10:00.528 --> 10:01.962
So you've never
been married?

10:01.964 --> 10:05.098
No. I mean,
to be completely honest, I've...

10:05.100 --> 10:07.467
I've only been
in one long-term relationship.

10:07.469 --> 10:08.802
Oh. What happened with that?

10:08.804 --> 10:10.370
That's a good question.

10:15.290 --> 10:16.557
After five years,

10:16.559 --> 10:19.293
it was just feeling like
more work than it should be.

10:19.295 --> 10:20.427
Oh, that's too bad.

10:20.429 --> 10:22.029
Was he a neurobiologist
like you?

10:22.031 --> 10:24.365
No. He's a theoretical physicist

10:24.367 --> 10:27.301
at Caltech.

10:27.303 --> 10:30.237
I love teaching math, but
that would be my dream job.

10:30.239 --> 10:31.505
What's his focus?

10:31.507 --> 10:34.842
Um... used to be string theory,
now it's dark matter.

10:34.844 --> 10:36.910
But... let's
not discuss Sheldon.

10:36.912 --> 10:38.812
Let's get back to you.

10:38.814 --> 10:42.282
Wait, you're not talking
about Dr. Sheldon <i>Cooper?</i>

10:43.551 --> 10:46.887
I'm trying not to.

10:47.722 --> 10:48.789
Do you know him?

10:48.791 --> 10:51.225
No, but I've followed
his work for years.

10:51.227 --> 10:52.393
He's a rock star.

10:52.395 --> 10:54.194
You've got to
tell me about him.

10:54.196 --> 10:55.996
What's he like?

10:58.333 --> 11:01.135
(door opens)
He really seems into her.

11:02.604 --> 11:04.405
I took a video.

11:04.407 --> 11:07.274
I forgot how much
fun this is.

11:07.276 --> 11:08.575
Okay, we saw them.

11:08.577 --> 11:10.277
Can we go catch the movie?

11:10.279 --> 11:12.346
(Penny sighs)
Why'd you bring him?

11:12.348 --> 11:14.948
I had to; we're married now.

11:14.950 --> 11:17.017
Ugh, I hear that.

11:25.755 --> 11:28.123
I'm sorry, just one more
question about Sheldon.

11:28.125 --> 11:30.225
Sure, why not?

11:30.227 --> 11:32.828
It's more of a four-part
question, really.

11:34.263 --> 11:36.798
When he wrote his paper on
supersingular prime numbers,

11:36.800 --> 11:38.367
how long did it take?

11:39.202 --> 11:41.169
Um... about an hour and half.

11:41.171 --> 11:42.504
Wow!

11:44.007 --> 11:45.607
I mean, wow!

11:45.609 --> 11:47.609
And you were
there to see it?

11:47.611 --> 11:50.812
Yes. Yep. We were on a date.

11:52.048 --> 11:55.083
Very much like this one.
Mm.

11:55.085 --> 11:56.818
I doubt it was
like this one.

11:56.820 --> 11:59.554
I mean, he's a genius, and
I wasn't even smart enough

11:59.556 --> 12:03.125
to figure out why my wife
always smelled of croissants.

12:03.127 --> 12:05.761
What was the rest
of your question?

12:05.763 --> 12:06.938
Do you think you could
introduce me to him?

12:06.962 --> 12:08.331
Really?

12:08.332 --> 12:11.133
You-you want me to introduce you
to my ex-boyfriend?

12:11.135 --> 12:13.068
You're right,
it's-it's weird.

12:13.070 --> 12:15.003
No, wait. Do it.

12:16.472 --> 12:17.906
No. I changed my mind.

12:17.908 --> 12:19.708
I'd be too nervous.

12:19.710 --> 12:22.277
Oh! I don't know
<i>what</i> to do.

12:23.279 --> 12:24.613
Are we gonna be much longer?

12:24.615 --> 12:26.648
I really have
to go to the bathroom.

12:26.650 --> 12:28.850
Right here.

12:31.721 --> 12:35.590
37 minutes left
until the deadline.

12:35.592 --> 12:37.793
Someone will show.

12:37.795 --> 12:41.163
And no matter what happens,
this is still a fun experiment.

12:41.165 --> 12:44.733
Not as fun as the night we
blew up grapes in the microwave.

12:45.468 --> 12:48.036
We really have led full lives.

12:48.871 --> 12:50.172
Someone will show.

12:50.174 --> 12:51.640
Maybe you don't want

12:51.642 --> 12:52.808
someone exactly like you.

12:52.810 --> 12:54.709
You know what they say:
opposites attract.

12:54.711 --> 12:56.645
Well, by that logic,

12:56.647 --> 13:00.115
I should be with someone short,
dull and needy, eh?

13:00.117 --> 13:01.516
Not to cast aspersions,

13:01.518 --> 13:05.821
but I can't shake a stick around
here without hitting <i>that.</i>

13:09.659 --> 13:12.294
You know, I once
drove 500 miles

13:12.296 --> 13:15.263
to hear him speak
at Stanford.

13:15.265 --> 13:18.266
I have a DVD of that lecture.

13:18.268 --> 13:20.268
Really? Wasn't it great?

13:20.270 --> 13:23.905
Not as a Valentine's
present, no.

13:23.907 --> 13:25.640
Well, the next time
you watch it,

13:25.642 --> 13:27.409
I'm the bloke who
asked the question

13:27.411 --> 13:30.412
that he said was
stupid and obvious.

13:30.414 --> 13:33.715
It was the nicest thing
he said to anyone there.

13:33.717 --> 13:35.550
That's, um, terrific.

13:35.552 --> 13:38.420
Listen, I'm-I'm kind of tired.
Can we call it a night?

13:38.422 --> 13:40.822
Oh, gosh. Sorry,
I've just spent the whole night

13:40.824 --> 13:42.791
talking about your ex-boyfriend.

13:42.793 --> 13:44.192
I'm such an idiot.

13:44.194 --> 13:46.128
No, you're not.

13:46.130 --> 13:49.064
Well, maybe not an idiot,
but certainly not as smart as...

13:49.066 --> 13:50.832
someone we won't mention.

13:50.834 --> 13:52.834
Thank you.
But you said

13:52.836 --> 13:55.070
you might introduce me to him--
I'm free on Thursday.

13:56.639 --> 13:58.206
Hey, hey,
they're leaving.

13:58.208 --> 14:01.042
What? Here,
give me, give me.

14:01.044 --> 14:03.645
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
they're coming right towards us.

14:03.647 --> 14:06.715
We got to get out of here.
Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?

14:06.717 --> 14:09.751
He and his tiny bladder
can take the bus!

14:09.753 --> 14:11.586
(starts engine)

14:12.455 --> 14:13.955
(both gasp)

14:13.957 --> 14:15.157
Oh, no!

14:15.159 --> 14:16.625
(turns off engine)

14:19.595 --> 14:21.930
She just hit my car!

14:21.932 --> 14:23.999
What are you guys
doing here?

14:24.001 --> 14:27.969
Oh! Hey, Ames!
What are you doing here?

14:28.871 --> 14:30.205
LEONARD:
What happened?

14:31.040 --> 14:32.274
OMG!

14:32.276 --> 14:34.209
Aren't you
Leonard Hofstadter?

14:34.211 --> 14:35.710
Yeah.

14:35.712 --> 14:38.446
I saw you speak at Stanford
with Sheldon Cooper!

14:38.448 --> 14:41.116
Amy, can you believe it?
It's Dr. Leonard Hofstadter!

14:43.119 --> 14:45.287
No. Pinch me.

14:45.289 --> 14:48.023
It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.
Can I shake your hand?

14:48.025 --> 14:50.025
I don't know if you want
to do that-- I was just...

14:50.027 --> 14:51.593
Okay, never mind.

14:52.428 --> 14:54.496
Amy, I'm never washing
this hand again.

14:54.498 --> 14:57.165
You really should.

14:58.334 --> 15:01.002
60 seconds.

15:01.004 --> 15:02.270
This is not looking good.

15:02.272 --> 15:04.239
One minute is
a long time.

15:04.241 --> 15:07.275
I've been telling women that
for 20 years.

15:09.946 --> 15:12.681
45.
45 seconds is

15:12.683 --> 15:15.016
plenty of time for a woman
to walk through that door

15:15.018 --> 15:16.384
and fall in love with me.

15:16.386 --> 15:19.487
You know, probably half that
if I break out the old cow eyes.

15:20.323 --> 15:21.790
30 seconds.

15:21.792 --> 15:23.258
Uh-oh.

15:23.260 --> 15:25.860
What if it's Jennifer Lawrence?

15:25.862 --> 15:27.128
What?

15:27.130 --> 15:29.431
Oh, that last <i>Hunger Games</i>
was not my cup of tea.

15:29.433 --> 15:32.334
You thought she was great
in <i>X-Men.</i>

15:32.336 --> 15:33.768
Oh, fine-- I won't shut my heart

15:33.770 --> 15:35.370
to the love
of Jennifer Lawrence.

15:36.606 --> 15:39.653
Guys, 15 seconds.
Maybe she's waiting to show up

15:39.654 --> 15:41.444
at the last possible moment.
(groans)

15:41.445 --> 15:42.811
Sounds like a drama queen.

15:42.813 --> 15:46.681
Oh, no.
It <i>is</i> Jennifer Lawrence.

15:47.416 --> 15:48.216
Five...

15:48.218 --> 15:49.584
four...

15:49.586 --> 15:51.186
three...

15:51.188 --> 15:53.021
two...

15:53.023 --> 15:54.422
one.

15:58.828 --> 16:00.729
That's too bad.

16:00.731 --> 16:03.231
Maybe we did make the test
too difficult.

16:03.233 --> 16:05.033
I don't think it matters.
Look, Sheldon,

16:05.035 --> 16:07.969
I believe when the time is right
for you to meet someone,

16:07.971 --> 16:09.304
it'll just happen.

16:09.306 --> 16:11.973
Okay? Not because of
a test or a Web site,

16:11.975 --> 16:14.175
(knocking)
but because...

16:14.177 --> 16:17.412
We are the dreamers of dreams!

16:23.152 --> 16:25.720
It's an actual girl,
and she's really pretty.

16:25.722 --> 16:27.555
Answer it!

16:27.557 --> 16:29.024
All right.

16:35.231 --> 16:36.564
Can I help you?

16:36.566 --> 16:39.834
Um, a-are you the physicist that
placed the ad on Craigslist?

16:39.836 --> 16:40.969
Yes.

16:40.971 --> 16:43.071
Hi. I'm Vanessa Bennett.

16:43.073 --> 16:44.939
Sorry it took a while
for me to get here.

16:44.941 --> 16:46.441
I was stuck in this
boring symposium

16:46.443 --> 16:49.044
on atomic spectroscopy
when I came across your ad,

16:49.046 --> 16:50.545
and it saved my night.

16:50.547 --> 16:52.347
The puzzles were...
were really fun.

16:52.349 --> 16:54.449
I've never had
to translate Klingon

16:54.451 --> 16:57.652
into ancient Sanskrit before.

16:57.654 --> 16:59.354
Well...

16:59.356 --> 17:02.557
careful, hmm, it's addictive.

17:02.559 --> 17:06.560
Chija''e'vlKub je.

17:08.698 --> 17:10.964
Or, as they say
in Sanskrit...

17:11.867 --> 17:14.836
Ahm asman matey-bee
<i>ta-teyva.</i>

17:14.838 --> 17:18.807
And just like that, you're
a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.

17:18.809 --> 17:21.776
Anyway, I-I just... I knew
I had to meet the person

17:21.778 --> 17:23.944
responsible for such
a brilliant idea.

17:23.946 --> 17:26.481
And I don't need to tell you,
there aren't a lot of men

17:26.483 --> 17:30.285
who love physics, archaic languages
and flags of the world.

17:30.287 --> 17:32.954
I am a bit of a unicorn.

17:32.956 --> 17:34.923
Well, you certainly seem

17:34.925 --> 17:37.459
like a special lady,
uh, but as you know,

17:37.461 --> 17:40.128
you missed the deadline,
so thanks for playing.

17:47.403 --> 17:49.604
How could you
send her away?!

17:49.606 --> 17:51.773
She was late.

17:51.775 --> 17:52.807
And...

17:52.809 --> 17:54.976
she found
atomic spectroscopy boring.

17:54.978 --> 17:58.680
Well, I wouldn't coitus her
with <i>your</i> genitals.

18:07.589 --> 18:09.956
Uh, thanks
for driving me home.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.424
No problem.

18:11.426 --> 18:13.026
I'm really sorry about your car.

18:13.028 --> 18:14.327
Oh, it's all right.

18:14.329 --> 18:17.063
If you're free next weekend,
I'd love to take you out again.

18:17.065 --> 18:19.999
Um... listen,
you're a really nice guy,

18:20.001 --> 18:23.269
but I just... I don't think
this is working out.

18:24.138 --> 18:25.438
Oh. Okay.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.572
(sighs): I'm...

18:26.574 --> 18:28.074
I'm really sorry.

18:28.076 --> 18:30.243
No, it's...
at least the same woman

18:30.245 --> 18:33.613
that rejected Sheldon Cooper
rejected me.

18:35.049 --> 18:38.618
There you go.
(awkward chuckle)

18:38.620 --> 18:41.354
If I ever do meet him,
we'll have that in common.

18:41.356 --> 18:42.689
Sure. Heh.

18:42.691 --> 18:44.657
And... he's kissed you
and I've kissed you,

18:44.659 --> 18:46.997
so if you think about it...
Okay, get out.
