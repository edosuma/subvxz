Of course she broke
out, you big dolt!

00:43.711 --> 00:44.843

10:24.690 --> 10:26.291
No, no. Those shoes
were totally you.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.460
I mean, I'm serious.
You should so buy them.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.428
You think?
We could go back.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.564
Oh, I've been looking
all over for you.

10:32.566 --> 10:36.234
"Bricks of fury: The final
brickening" starts today.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.603
Look, if we run
and push people out of our way,

10:38.605 --> 10:40.138
we can just make the matinee.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.806
Tempting, but I already
promised she go

10:41.808 --> 10:43.541
we'd go get our eyebrows waxed.

10:43.543 --> 10:44.743
Ok, but we're gonna...

10:44.745 --> 10:49.914
you wax your eyebrows?
Huh? What's that about?

10:49.916 --> 10:51.282
Forget I mentioned it.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.551
Done. Hey, you know,
she can come, too.

10:53.553 --> 10:56.755
But "bricks of fury:
The musical" was so contrived,

10:56.757 --> 10:58.923
I gave up on the whole series.

10:58.925 --> 11:01.626
What about...
"The memo pad"?

11:01.628 --> 11:04.162
How did we get from
bricks to chicks?

11:04.164 --> 11:05.664
Oh, I've been wanting
to see that.

11:05.666 --> 11:08.566
I'm kind of over the whole
"bricks of fury" saga, too.

11:08.568 --> 11:12.270
Hey, we'll catch up later
an Bueno Nacho, ok?

11:12.272 --> 11:15.540
Well, looks like it's
you and me, Rufus.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.609
Oh, come on.
Don't tell me

11:17.611 --> 11:19.644
you'd rather see
"the memo pad", too.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.579

12:26.780 --> 12:30.648
K.P., she go
is not our friend.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.484
She's older and criminaler,

12:32.486 --> 12:33.952
and what about her brothers?

12:33.954 --> 12:35.353

12:43.663 --> 12:45.263

waxing business?

sort of fell apart.

Ok. New plan.
Bring me she go.

If I turn her evil again,
maybe between the two of us,

just asked me out.

14:23.763 --> 14:27.699
What do I do? I'm weak
on the whole dating thing.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.368
Seriously, that whole
Drakken business

14:30.370 --> 14:31.903
didn't leave a lot
of time for socializing.

actually talk to them.

Better check.

brought our breadsticks yet.

have breadsticks here.

from the unexplained onslaught.

What about go city?

is to help my brothers.

to go tower.
