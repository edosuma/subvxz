00:10.611 --> 00:12.544
             You did not eat
         your breakfast, master.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.045
Oh, no, I didn't have time,
         Jeannie.

00:14.047 --> 00:15.980
            Oh. Will you be home
                 for lunch?

00:15.982 --> 00:17.249
    No, I can't make
      that either.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.783
  I have a conference
     this morning

00:18.785 --> 00:20.485
 with General Peterson
   and Dr. Bellows,

00:20.487 --> 00:22.587
  and then there's some
NASA officials coming down

00:22.589 --> 00:23.622
   from Washington.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.457
            Oh, that is a shame.

00:25.459 --> 00:28.126
  I thought we might have lunch
at a marvelous little restaurant

00:28.128 --> 00:29.727
                   I know of
               on the Left Bank.

00:29.729 --> 00:31.729
 I wish I could, but--

00:31.731 --> 00:34.232
  There's no, uh-- There's
no Left Bank in Cocoa Beach.

    It is called Chez Moustache.

              It is in a quaint
            little part of town,

00:38.705 --> 00:40.805
       with a cobblestone street
         in front and people--

00:40.807 --> 00:43.441
Some other day, huh?
       Sorry.

00:43.443 --> 00:44.609
                        Ooh.

00:46.346 --> 00:48.380
           They make a marvelous
           cheese soufflé there.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.548
 Why don't you go there?

00:49.550 --> 00:50.782
        Oh, I could not do that.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.717
         It would not be any fun
           without you, master.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.186
     Yeah. Yeah.

00:57.691 --> 01:00.192
   Yeah, a little. I--
 I studied it in school.

01:01.495 --> 01:02.894

02:41.128 --> 02:44.229
        You must eat lunch
  and this was right on the way.

Right on the way to where?
    The Eiffel Tower?

02:46.233 --> 02:48.199
 I'm due to be walking
into the conference room

02:52.872 --> 02:54.539
            You are at NASA. Mm.
       Huh?

02:54.541 --> 02:57.475
            Now, shall we order
            the cheese soufflé?

02:58.545 --> 02:59.811
     Where's Major Nelson?

02:59.813 --> 03:01.779
 Oh, he's always

He should be here

    You know everybody.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.954
                           Yes.

03:17.464 --> 03:19.831

 Well, let's not
  go into that.

But I don't understa--

How can I be here and there
     at the same time?

03:25.472 --> 03:27.606
     Oh, that is child's play.

03:27.608 --> 03:30.675
 If you like, we could also be
having lunch in Rome right now.

   All that can happen is that
 you will have a marvelous lunch

03:39.686 --> 03:41.419
      and then you can go back
              to work.

03:41.421 --> 03:43.688
 I'll remember everything
 that happens at Kennedy?

03:43.690 --> 03:45.590
         Well, of course.
          You are there.

   Well, I haven't used it
      since high school.

04:22.462 --> 04:24.496
            The primary reason
         I came down here myself

04:24.498 --> 04:26.398
           is to let you know
       how excited Washington is

04:26.400 --> 04:29.033
            about the potential
           of Operation: Galaxy.

04:29.035 --> 04:31.068
  Gentlemen, for the first time,

04:31.070 --> 04:33.738
       we have a really big jump
        on every other country.

04:33.740 --> 04:35.139
And we intend
to keep it that way.

04:35.141 --> 04:36.307
                  That's right.

04:36.309 --> 04:37.876
 Washington wants to be certain

04:37.878 --> 04:41.546
      that we maintain
     absolute security.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.949
     Well, you can reassure
   Washington on that score.

04:43.951 --> 04:47.319
       Oh, yes, gentlemen.
 Our security here is foolproof.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.721
  Yeah. Once I forgot my pass
and I had to spend the whole day

04:49.723 --> 04:51.389

 Jeannie, it's the best thing
I've eaten in my life, really.

05:01.501 --> 05:03.468
         Oh, did I not tell you?
          Yeah.

05:05.238 --> 05:06.938
   I wonder how I'm doing
      at the meeting.

05:08.442 --> 05:11.443
        Mm. Brilliantly, master.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.613
        [CHUCKLING]
         Oh, good.

05:20.720 --> 05:21.919
       Look.

05:21.921 --> 05:24.889
                Isn't that
         the American astronaut,

05:24.891 --> 05:26.291
              Major Nelson?

05:26.293 --> 05:27.492
       Yes.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.627
But what is he doing in Paris?

05:29.629 --> 05:33.164
      I don't know why we were
    not informed of his arrival.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.467
      Maybe they sneaked him in.

05:35.469 --> 05:39.304
It is a deliberate insult
to the French air force.

05:39.306 --> 05:41.005
De Gaulle will be furious.

05:41.007 --> 05:44.442
           Perhaps he only looks
             like Major Nelson.

05:45.712 --> 05:48.513
For his sake, I hope so.

05:48.515 --> 05:49.814
     I know.

05:49.816 --> 05:53.684
I will call my good friend,
   Dr. Bellows, at NASA,

05:53.686 --> 05:56.221
and find out what marches.

go off perfectly.

       that Major Nelson
      was coming to Paris.

06:34.427 --> 06:37.428

 to have given him a reception.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.431
  He's not going to Paris.

06:40.433 --> 06:44.502
Heh, I did not say he was going
     to Paris, Dr. Bellows.

06:44.504 --> 06:46.171
          He is in Paris.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.206
   But that's impossible.
      He's right here.

          who you're looking at,

06:56.583 --> 06:59.250
         but I can assure you
     that it's not Major Nelson.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.653
  <i> Well, it's probably someone</i>
      <i> who resembles him.</i>

 an American Air Force uniform,

07:07.427 --> 07:11.396
        a NASA insignia
    and an astronaut wings?

07:11.398 --> 07:13.731
