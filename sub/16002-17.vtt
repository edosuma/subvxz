- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.333
Yeah, I guess.

25:24.667 --> 25:27.041
All right. Yeah,
I'll talk to you later.

25:28.583 --> 25:30.041
Heh!

25:30.041 --> 25:32.333
Last night was crazy.
The lesbian in-law.

25:32.333 --> 25:35.208
- The week's been crappy.
- It's not finished.

25:35.208 --> 25:38.875
No, it's not. I was thinking
that it's not really due
until tomorrow,

25:38.875 --> 25:42.917
so we can work on it today
and then we go in there
tomorrow and we just...

25:42.917 --> 25:46.125
We wing it. You know,
like the Zap days.

25:46.125 --> 25:48.875
Or we get an extension.
You remember?

25:48.875 --> 25:52.083
Come on, buddy.
"Deadlines is for suckers, yo!"

25:52.083 --> 25:55.083
You remember that? We used
to say that all the time.

25:57.417 --> 26:00.583
- We'll make it work. All right?
- Stop saying "we."

26:00.583 --> 26:04.834
There's no "we," Dave.
It's just me and now
we're screwed.

26:07.417 --> 26:10.834
I'll talk to you later.
I have a meeting now.

26:18.750 --> 26:20.417
[Ivy] What are you doing?

26:20.417 --> 26:21.709
Ow!

26:21.709 --> 26:24.792
I'm just unloading the beer.
For the party.

26:24.792 --> 26:27.166
God, this party
sucks already.

26:27.166 --> 26:30.750
Baby, look, I know
you're not happy about
throwing the party here,

26:30.750 --> 26:33.500
but we're at Adam's house
all the time. It's not fair.

26:33.500 --> 26:36.041
- But what are people gonna say?
- Who cares?

26:36.041 --> 26:39.083
We have nothing to be
embarrassed about, all right?

26:39.083 --> 26:42.417
These people are our friends.
You can't hide
from them forever.

26:42.417 --> 26:45.458
Besides, you know,
Adam could really
use this right now.

26:45.458 --> 26:49.208
- Why? He just got made partner.
- Yeah. Um...

26:49.208 --> 26:54.750
You remember Nicole's little
sex story? "Nothing special"?

26:54.750 --> 26:59.166
No way! Adam and Nicole? Oh, my
God! That is freaking fantastic!

26:59.166 --> 27:02.333
All right, calm down.
And keep it to yourself, woman.

27:02.333 --> 27:05.750
- Keep it to yourself.
- Wow.

27:16.792 --> 27:22.000
- Dave. Deena's husband.
- Yeah. Right.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.542
Listen, I'm sorry to hear
about your guys'... divorce.

27:27.375 --> 27:29.625
Not that I couldn't
see it coming.

27:30.834 --> 27:32.917
- [grunting]
- [bell rings]

27:35.417 --> 27:38.041
You know what?
We're not divorced, jackass!

27:50.917 --> 27:52.834
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:52.834 --> 27:57.041
- Getting ready
for Adam's party?
- Sure am. You're not coming?

27:57.041 --> 28:02.709
Well, you know, I've
got mom and Mark, the ASL
teacher's, coming over.

28:02.709 --> 28:06.375
I've been working
with him. He's, you know,
paid for through the week,

28:06.375 --> 28:10.000
so I called Adam.
He said it was OK.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.750
Something bothering you?

28:11.750 --> 28:15.208
- We, uh, making a mistake?
- What?

28:15.208 --> 28:18.333
Think that I'm holding you back
in some way? Because if I am,

28:18.333 --> 28:20.542
- I need to know.
- Where is this coming from?

28:20.542 --> 28:24.375
- Hm...
- What did she say to you?

28:24.375 --> 28:27.208
- Why didn't you tell her?
- I knew she would ruin it.

28:27.208 --> 28:29.333
Yeah, well,
you got that right.

28:29.333 --> 28:33.125
She said that she
didn't think we should
be back together anymore.

28:33.125 --> 28:35.709
- Ridiculous.
- You're be better
off without me.

28:35.709 --> 28:39.750
She said that I'm
not right for you.

28:39.750 --> 28:41.041
Dave.

28:44.083 --> 28:45.375
I got to get to the party.

28:53.959 --> 28:56.834
[rock music plays]

28:56.834 --> 28:59.208
It should be right here.

29:01.250 --> 29:04.417
This should be it.
This can't be right.

29:04.417 --> 29:08.000
- Wow. This is nicer
than your place.
- Shut up, Brian.

29:11.834 --> 29:15.083
Welcome. Please, come in.

29:15.083 --> 29:17.458
Uh... [laughs]

29:17.458 --> 29:18.959
[Adam] What the hell?

29:20.834 --> 29:22.959
You guys have a lot of money.

29:23.625 --> 29:24.917
How do you...?

29:24.917 --> 29:26.834
- Could have mentioned this.
- What?

29:26.834 --> 29:29.792
- You live in a place like this?
- A house. Get over it.

29:29.792 --> 29:31.792
The bar's over there.

29:31.792 --> 29:36.125
Oh. Excuse me. Hi. Have you
never heard of a coaster?

29:36.125 --> 29:38.834
I think I need a drink.

29:40.625 --> 29:42.792
- [Nicole] Hey, Dave.
- Hey, sweetheart!

29:42.792 --> 29:45.959
Hey, Jimmy!
See, I said it. Hey, Jimmy.

29:45.959 --> 29:49.291
That's great. Funny.
It's really funny. "Hey, Jimmy."

29:49.291 --> 29:51.750
- Don't you love that?
- No.

29:51.750 --> 29:53.959
- Can I talk for a second?
- Yeah, sure.

29:55.458 --> 29:58.125
[Adam] Wow. Crazy, huh?

29:58.125 --> 30:04.041
Why is it that, uh, things never
turn out the way you plan them?

30:04.041 --> 30:08.125
I don't know.
I guess that's just
how life is.

30:08.125 --> 30:11.500
God, I'm sorry.
That was stupid.

30:11.500 --> 30:15.333
No, you're right.
We just have to roll with it.

30:15.333 --> 30:17.834
Try a new path.

30:17.834 --> 30:22.625
- Lower expectations
if you have to.
- Like when having sex with me?

30:24.667 --> 30:27.291
Not what I meant, Adam.

30:27.291 --> 30:31.000
What I said before to the girls,
I didn't mean that.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.542
I just said it
to throw them off the scent.

30:36.458 --> 30:38.667
Sex with you was fantastic, OK?

30:40.792 --> 30:45.083
Almost perfect to have
the first man I was
with after Angelo be a friend.

30:45.083 --> 30:50.250
A good friend. Someone I
could trust and be free with.

30:50.250 --> 30:54.458
And you were
so sweet and manly and hot.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.875
It kind of freaked me out.

30:58.875 --> 31:01.375
Because we can't
have a thing, you know?

31:01.375 --> 31:03.583
Yeah, I know.

31:06.834 --> 31:12.041
- I'm still glad
we did what we did.
- Me too.

31:19.959 --> 31:23.750
That's right.
Look who's signing.

31:24.542 --> 31:26.125
Good girl.

31:27.959 --> 31:31.583
Hey. What are you doing?
You try one, honey.

31:31.583 --> 31:34.709
- Oh, uh...
- Oh, come on, Deena.

31:34.709 --> 31:37.625
- Yeah. No.
- We've been working all day.

31:37.625 --> 31:41.083
- She's really good at it.
- Well, yeah.
Like mother like daughter.

31:41.083 --> 31:42.875
- Uh...
- [Carrie coos]

31:48.375 --> 31:54.000
- I don't know what she said.
- She said she's not like you.

32:01.208 --> 32:04.291
Um, Mom... Uh...

32:07.959 --> 32:12.000
- You want me to take up golf?
- No, no, no, no. Uh...

32:12.000 --> 32:15.458
I want you to go.

32:16.625 --> 32:18.625
I want you to leave, Mom.

32:18.625 --> 32:23.750
- Why? Because of Mark?
- No, no. No, no.

32:23.750 --> 32:29.000
It's not about Mark.
No, no. I love Mark.

32:30.458 --> 32:34.166
But what you
don't understand is...

32:34.166 --> 32:38.792
- ...I love Dave.
- Honey, of course you do.

32:38.792 --> 32:42.333
He's the father of your
children. You're in
the middle of a divorce.

32:42.333 --> 32:44.959
It's hard and it's confusing.
I know.

32:44.959 --> 32:50.500
Mom, Dave and I started dating
again a few weeks ago.

32:50.500 --> 32:54.458
And it's going good.
Mom, it's going really good.

32:54.458 --> 32:58.000
And I'm not sure
where it's headed,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.500
but I want it to work.

33:01.834 --> 33:03.709
Why didn't you tell me?

33:03.709 --> 33:07.542
Because you would start
telling me how you did it.

33:07.542 --> 33:11.000
And then you would
start telling me how
you think I should do it.

33:13.834 --> 33:14.959
I'll leave tomorrow.

33:24.083 --> 33:28.166
Not so fast. All right.
Oh, that's good.

33:28.166 --> 33:32.542
You got the promotion,
but you're not getting
a house like this?

33:32.542 --> 33:34.750
- No. Not even close.
- That sucks.

33:34.750 --> 33:36.208
- Telling me.
- Yeah.

33:36.208 --> 33:39.375
Hey! Hold on, sister.
I need you to spill it.

33:39.375 --> 33:41.500
You're wondering,
but nothing to tell.

33:41.500 --> 33:45.500
- Yeah.
- I'm taking off.
Can you get a ride?

33:45.500 --> 33:48.834
Yeah. Totally.
And if not, I could
probably stay in this house.

33:48.834 --> 33:50.542
No houseguests.

33:50.542 --> 33:54.041
- OK. Hey, dude, you all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I just...

33:54.041 --> 33:56.875
...got a lot of work to do.
Congrats.

33:56.875 --> 34:00.041
Well, hey, you're the boss,
why don't you make Dave do it?

34:00.041 --> 34:03.709
- That's funny. Grow some balls.
- What was that?

34:03.709 --> 34:06.542
- Nothing.
- Let me hear it.

34:06.542 --> 34:08.917
- Don't want to hear.
- Screw up your career,

34:08.917 --> 34:11.875
- what do I care?
- I didn't screw
up my career, Bri.

34:11.875 --> 34:15.333
You screwed it up.
You waltzed in,
you took my promotion,

34:15.333 --> 34:18.583
ordered me around.
Come on, you got some
notes about my outfit?

34:18.583 --> 34:21.208
The promotion wasn't yours.
It never was.

34:21.208 --> 34:23.291
I'm best in the department,
until you.

34:23.291 --> 34:26.250
Jealous? Because Natasha
was never gonna give it to you.

34:26.250 --> 34:28.250
She didn't want you
on this project.

34:28.250 --> 34:31.375
- What?
- She told me not
to put you on it.

34:31.375 --> 34:35.417
She thinks you're
slow and uninspired
and I gave it to you anyway.

34:36.959 --> 34:38.917
Is that what you think?

34:38.917 --> 34:42.375
You know what? I don't care.
What the hell does Natasha know?

34:42.375 --> 34:46.166
She doesn't know anything.
Know why? She's never
created a video game!

34:46.166 --> 34:48.834
And you know what?
I don't want your pity.

34:48.834 --> 34:53.291
It wasn't pity. I give you a
shot, and you pissed it away.

34:57.125 --> 34:59.625
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Not in there! Not in there!

35:07.458 --> 35:09.792
- You're Lil Tammy?
- I'm sorry.

35:09.792 --> 35:12.291
- No.
- You're Lil Tammy.

35:12.291 --> 35:13.375
On for six years.

35:15.291 --> 35:16.458
Hey, everyone, look!

35:16.458 --> 35:20.417
Ivy's Lil Tammy! What? She is.

35:21.333 --> 35:23.250
I hate you.

35:31.333 --> 35:34.500
- OK, so now you
don't even knock?
- Guess who's on TV?

35:34.500 --> 35:37.792
- They've been
playing it all day.
- Oh, great.

35:37.792 --> 35:43.000
- Here's my favorite part.
- ...locking lips
with an escort.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.792
- Yeah.
- Who is this mystery man?

35:46.792 --> 35:51.208
Look, if you came here
just to make me feel bad,
you can just get in line.

35:51.208 --> 35:55.333
I'm sorry I blew you off
and I'm sorry I had a good time.

35:55.333 --> 35:58.417
- What else can I say?
- Nothing.

35:58.417 --> 36:01.834
It's just I was trying so hard
to help you get over Bridget,

36:01.834 --> 36:05.458
and the next thing I know you're
on TV making out with Stephanie.

36:05.458 --> 36:07.500
I don't know,
it makes me feel stupid.

36:07.500 --> 36:10.792
You're not stupid.
And you did help.

36:10.792 --> 36:14.417
I mean, the brownies
didn't help, but you did.

36:14.417 --> 36:18.208
Kissing Stephanie just
happened. It wasn't like
this big plan that I had.

36:19.750 --> 36:23.041
You should know she's not
looking for anything
serious now.

36:23.041 --> 36:27.333
I know. Me either. Probably
why we got along so well.

36:27.333 --> 36:31.875
Well, you should ask her out.
I mean, I don't know
if you want to.

36:31.875 --> 36:35.208
She could really use a guy like
you in her life right now.

36:39.125 --> 36:41.709
You are a good friend,
you know that?

36:42.709 --> 36:44.041
Thanks.

37:00.792 --> 37:02.500
[knocking]

37:02.500 --> 37:05.750
- [Dave] Hey.
- Hey.

37:05.750 --> 37:10.333
Listen, I just wanted
to tell you that I didn't
actively try to sabotage you

37:10.333 --> 37:12.917
or the project.
I mean, I got a lot going on,

37:12.917 --> 37:16.083
but the truth is
it's gonna take me
a while to get used to this.

37:16.083 --> 37:18.250
The whole new me and you thing.

37:19.625 --> 37:23.250
Yeah, I think I got
to work on that too. Jellybean?

37:23.250 --> 37:26.083
I'm OK. So, look, dude.

37:26.083 --> 37:28.750
I'm gonna talk to Natasha,
tell her the truth.

37:28.750 --> 37:32.500
No. No, no, you won't.
This project,
I've been looking at it

37:32.500 --> 37:36.166
and looking at it and looking
at it and, uh... it sucks.

37:36.166 --> 37:38.500
- Dude, it totally sucks.
- Knowing Natasha,

37:38.500 --> 37:43.291
she gave it to me just to test
me. And, um, you know what?

37:43.291 --> 37:48.291
We're scrapping this game.
So that gives us an hour
to come up with something.

37:48.291 --> 37:50.959
- I got this thing.
- Yeah?

37:50.959 --> 37:54.291
I just started developing it,
OK? So you got to go easy on me.

37:54.291 --> 37:58.667
But if KC Gaming is looking
for stuff for 14-year-old boys,

37:58.667 --> 38:02.083
- I think this is kind of cool.
- Life Sucks?

38:11.125 --> 38:12.667
- I love it.
- She loves it.

38:12.667 --> 38:14.625
Wow. Love it. That's great.

38:14.625 --> 38:19.667
Well, "love" is a little strong.
It has tremendous potential.

38:19.667 --> 38:22.583
I have to say, Brian,
I'm a little surprised

38:22.583 --> 38:25.333
that you wasted company time
on that skateboard game.

38:25.333 --> 38:28.041
Great job, Greco.
I knew you had it in you.

38:28.041 --> 38:30.709
Yeah. Thank you.

38:34.417 --> 38:37.000
- This was a test, wasn't it?
- Don't get paranoid.

38:38.333 --> 38:40.667
And don't defy me again.

38:53.417 --> 38:57.500
Hey. Hey, Mom.
You need some help packing?

38:57.500 --> 39:00.208
No, thanks.
I always pack light.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.542
[sighs] Listen...

39:07.709 --> 39:11.959
- About last night...
- No, don't, OK?

39:11.959 --> 39:16.834
I said the same thing
to my mother. I think
it's a rite of passage.

39:18.709 --> 39:22.959
You know, one day,
though it's hard for
you to comprehend this,

39:22.959 --> 39:26.375
your little girls are gonna grow
up and, all of a sudden,

39:26.375 --> 39:30.750
you're gonna be irrelevant.
Unnecessary.

39:30.750 --> 39:33.667
It's just the strangest thing.

39:33.667 --> 39:37.750
I sometimes don't
know how to be here.

39:42.083 --> 39:43.083
I do.

But I just want
what's best for you. OK?

39:49.417 --> 39:54.250
The same as you want for your
kids. So you just know that.

39:55.917 --> 39:58.959
I do. I do, Mom.

I love you and you always
have a place here.

40:02.125 --> 40:06.083
- Oh, darling.
- Come back soon, OK?

40:06.083 --> 40:09.333
[Frankie] Honey, I don't
want to go. I love you so much.

40:09.333 --> 40:11.834
- Make your Mommy
bring you to see me.
- OK.

Yeah.

40:27.834 --> 40:31.166
- Hey, Dave,
I owe you an apology.
- No.

40:31.166 --> 40:33.625
- I was out of line.
- It's cool.

40:33.625 --> 40:37.166
No, no. Just because I'm not
a fan of intercourse

40:37.166 --> 40:40.291
- doesn't mean
it's not right for Deena.
- Wow.

40:40.291 --> 40:43.959
- Joke.
- Yeah. It's a good one.

40:43.959 --> 40:46.458
- Yeah.
- Oh, you are so cool.

40:46.458 --> 40:49.291
Yeah, yeah. Well, maybe someday
Deena will think so.

40:49.291 --> 40:51.625
Maybe we can put
in a good word for each other.

40:51.625 --> 40:54.667
- I would like that.
- Be good.

40:54.667 --> 40:56.875
- You're a good man, Dave.
- You think so?

40:56.875 --> 41:00.000

I wasn't expecting a package.
