WEBVTT

00:05.036 --> 00:09.140
ATOMIC SHOCK. ATOMIC SHOCK
AND... PLASMA BLAST!

00:09.140 --> 00:10.381
YES!

00:10.381 --> 00:11.382
( knocking )

00:12.613 --> 00:17.248
THE PATIENT, ROOSEVELT, SUFFERS
FROM AN IRRATIONAL FEAR OF...

00:17.248 --> 00:19.650
FEAR ITSELF.

00:19.650 --> 00:20.751
IT'S NOT MOMMY.

00:20.751 --> 00:23.724
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND
TO BE WORKING.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.627
HI, PRINCESS.
HEY, HOW WAS SCHOOL?

00:26.627 --> 00:28.229
NOT GOOD.

00:28.229 --> 00:31.532
MY TEACHER SAYS I CAN'T BE
"CHLOE THE MAGNIFICENT"
AT SCHOOL ANYMORE.

00:31.532 --> 00:35.566
YEAH. THEY HAVE A STRICT
"NO COSTUME" POLICY,

00:35.566 --> 00:38.509
AND HER TEACHER THINKS THE WHOLE
"CHLOE THE MAGNIFICENT" THING

00:38.509 --> 00:39.640
HAS GOTTEN A LITTLE OUT OF HAND.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.642
AWW, BUT SHE'S ADORABLE!

00:41.642 --> 00:44.675
AND SHE'S JUST EXPRESSING
HER INNER SENSE OF MAGIC.

00:44.675 --> 00:47.178
SHE WAS SELLING
"FAIRY DUST" AND "HAPPY DREAMS"

00:47.178 --> 00:48.719
AT LUNCH FOR TWO BUCKS A POP.

00:50.181 --> 00:51.722
CHLOE, I'M DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

00:51.722 --> 00:55.086
YOU WERE CHARGING ME FOUR.

00:55.086 --> 00:56.687
BUT I GAVE YOU THE GOOD STUFF.

01:01.492 --> 01:03.664
AND THEN THERE'S THAT.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.065
OH YEAH.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.637
I AM ROCKING THIS BOOTS.

01:06.637 --> 01:07.568
♪♪

01:07.568 --> 01:09.740
AND STRUT, AND STRUT,
AND TURN...

01:09.740 --> 01:11.402
STRIKE A POSE.

01:11.402 --> 01:14.745
AND KEEP IT FIERCE.

01:35.426 --> 01:38.629
SO, WHY DID KARL WANT TO MEET
YOU IN THE DRAMA CLASSROOM?

01:38.629 --> 01:40.831
WHY DOES KARL FINK
DO ANYTHING?

01:40.831 --> 01:42.503
HE'S PURE EVIL.

01:42.503 --> 01:45.105
LOOK, WHATEVER HE HAS PLANNED,
THANKS FOR COMING WITH ME.

01:45.105 --> 01:49.440
I'LL EITHER NEED A WITNESS,
OR SOMEONE TO HELP ME GNAW
THROUGH THE ROPES.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.581
YOU KNOW I'LL
ALWAYS HELP YOU.

01:50.581 --> 01:52.843
EVEN IF IT MEANS MISSING
LUNCH ON TACO TUESDAY.

01:52.843 --> 01:55.316
Both: FUN TO SAY,
AND FUN TO EAT!

01:55.316 --> 01:56.517
HELLO, LADIES.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.850
THIS IS THE INFAMOUS KARL FINK,
OUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR,

01:59.850 --> 02:03.354
AND AVERY'S SWORN ENEMY SINCE
LITTLE SMARTY SCIENCE CAMP

02:03.354 --> 02:06.157
WHEN HE TRIED
TO WEAPONIZE COOTIES.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.129
THANK YOU FOR MEETING ME, AVERY.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.302
AND THANK YOU FOR TAGGING ALONG,
AVERY'S SIDEKICK.

02:11.302 --> 02:13.604
PLEASE DON'T DO THAT THING
WHERE YOU TALK TOGETHER.

02:13.604 --> 02:15.206
Both: YOU CAN'T TELL
US WHAT TO DO.

02:16.507 --> 02:18.339
AND BEFORE YOU TRY ANYTHING,

02:18.339 --> 02:20.441
THE HALL MONITORS
KNOW WHERE I AM.

02:20.441 --> 02:23.844
AND STEVE HAS FINALLY BUILT UP
ENOUGH STAMINA TO WALK BRISKLY.

02:23.844 --> 02:27.348
OH, AVERY, AVERY, AVERY.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.749
I KNOW WE'VE HAD
OUR DIFFERENCES IN THE PAST,

02:28.749 --> 02:31.422
BUT I'VE MADE PEACE WITH
ALL THE WRONGS YOU'VE DONE ME.

02:31.422 --> 02:34.855
LIKE STEALING MY GRAHAM CRACKERS
AND LITTLE GENIUS SCIENCE CAMP.

02:34.855 --> 02:37.788
I DID NOT STEAL YOUR
GRAHAM CRACKERS, KARL.

02:37.788 --> 02:39.590
AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE
MAD AT ME FOR ANYTHING,

02:39.590 --> 02:41.832
IT SHOULD BE FOR BESTING YOU
AT THIS YEAR'S SPELLING BEE

02:41.832 --> 02:44.265
WITH THE WORD: XANTHOSIS.

02:44.265 --> 02:48.669
X-A-N-T-H-O-S- I -S.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.472
SEE PAPA, I KNOW IT NOW!

02:51.472 --> 02:53.944
I'M SORRY, KARL.
DID YOUR FATHER PASS?

02:53.944 --> 02:56.547
NO, HE'S AT THE
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.

02:56.547 --> 02:58.709
THE POINT IS...

02:58.709 --> 03:01.252
WE'RE THE TWO SMARTEST KIDS
IN SCHOOL.

03:01.252 --> 03:03.814
NO OFFENSE NUMBER 147.

03:03.814 --> 03:05.586
WE SHOULD BE FRIENDS,

03:05.586 --> 03:07.458
AND AS A SYMBOL
OF OUR NEW START,

03:07.458 --> 03:09.590
PLEASE ACCEPT THESE FLOWERS.

03:09.590 --> 03:14.325
WOW, I'M...
THIS IS VERY NICE OF YOU.

03:32.683 --> 03:34.985
YOU HAVE BEEN FINKED!

03:34.985 --> 03:37.948
GRAHAM CRACKER STEALER!

03:37.948 --> 03:38.989
REALLY?

03:38.989 --> 03:40.721
WHY DID YOU
GO THROUGH ALL THIS

03:40.721 --> 03:43.394
WHEN YOU COULD HAVE
JUST SQUIRTED ME WHEN I
WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR?

03:43.394 --> 03:45.296
WHY DID THE VIKINGS PULL
THEIR ENEMIES' LUNGS OUT,

03:45.296 --> 03:46.557
AND SPLAY THEM
ACROSS THEIR CHEST?

03:46.557 --> 03:48.659
BECAUSE IT'S FUN!

03:48.659 --> 03:52.763
YOU ARE A CRUEL, DECEITFUL,
AND VINDICTIVE LITTLE MAN.

03:52.763 --> 03:54.435
AND THOSE AREN'T
EVEN MY WORDS.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.508
I HEARD YOUR MOTHER SAY IT
TO YOUR PIANO TEACHER.

03:57.508 --> 03:59.610
YOU LEFT OUT
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART.

03:59.610 --> 04:01.672
I'M AVENGED!

04:02.813 --> 04:05.015
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
ABOUT THE VIKINGS.

04:08.619 --> 04:10.981
WHY DO THEY CALL IT
A "DOG EAT DOG" WORLD?

04:10.981 --> 04:12.583
DOGS DON'T TREAT
EACH OTHER BADLY,

04:12.583 --> 04:14.425
BUT LOOK WHAT
KARL DID TO AVERY.

04:17.588 --> 04:20.591
HUMANS ARE ALSO CAPABLE
OF AWESOME ACTS OF GOODNESS.

04:20.591 --> 04:24.365
LIKE FLOWING ME THESE, YO!

04:28.639 --> 04:29.770
HELLO, NEIGHBOR.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.472
KARL, GO AWAY!

04:31.472 --> 04:32.673
YOU'RE A CREEPY LITTLE LIAR,

04:32.673 --> 04:34.545
AND I WISH YOU WOULD
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.

04:34.545 --> 04:35.776
AGAIN, NOT MY WORDS.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.608
YOUR MOTHER HAS
NO INSIDE VOICE.

04:37.608 --> 04:41.512
I MADE YOU A PEACE OFFERING.

04:41.512 --> 04:43.854
"I'Z BEEN FINKED"?

04:43.854 --> 04:47.287
ACTUALLY, I MADE 500.
I'M SELLING THEM.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.521
WHAT BRAINLESS BABOON
WOULD BUY THOSE?

04:50.521 --> 04:52.563
OH, COOL! THEY'RE IN!

04:52.563 --> 04:55.566
AND REMEMBER, I STILL HAVE
A MUG AND A MOUSE PAD COMING.

04:57.798 --> 05:01.802
WELL, I AM OFF TO GET READY
FOR THE SCHOOL-WIDE MATH
COMPETITION SATURDAY.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.034
WILL YOU BE COMPETING
AT THE X-SQUARED GAMES?

05:04.034 --> 05:06.777
YOU KNOW MATH ISN'T MY THING.

05:06.777 --> 05:09.640
YES. WELL, NOW I CAN CREATE
THIS WONDERFUL AUTO-TUNE.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.412
( auto-tuned ): ♪ YOU KNOW MATH
ISN'T MY THING ♪

05:11.412 --> 05:12.983
♪ MATH--MATH--MATH
ISN'T MY THING ♪

05:12.983 --> 05:14.785
I KNOW!

05:16.547 --> 05:18.989
AND SO THE CAT SAYS...
NOTHING!

05:18.989 --> 05:21.522
BECAUSE CATS ARE STUPID!

05:22.723 --> 05:23.754
SHH!

05:23.754 --> 05:25.726
STAN JUST TOLD ME
THE GREATEST JOKE.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.097
GOOD ONE, STAN.

05:27.097 --> 05:28.459
YOU GUYS!

05:28.459 --> 05:29.600
KARL JUST LEFT.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.662
HE'S RIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THAT DOOR.

05:31.662 --> 05:33.604
IF ANYONE FINDS OUT
STAN'S SECRET,

05:33.604 --> 05:35.806
THEY'LL TAKE HIM AWAY
AND DO EXPERIMENTS ON HIM.

05:35.806 --> 05:36.737
WHAT SECRET?

05:36.737 --> 05:38.469
NOTHING. THERE'S NO SECRET.

05:38.469 --> 05:39.810
STAN'S JUST A NORMAL DOG.

05:39.810 --> 05:41.612
YOU CAN'T FOOL ME,
JENNINGS.

05:41.612 --> 05:42.973
I WILL FIND OUT
WHAT YOU'RE HIDING,

05:42.973 --> 05:44.815
IF I HAVE TO TRACK YOU
TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH,

05:44.815 --> 05:46.677
AND IF IT TAKES ME
THE REST OF MY DAYS!

05:46.677 --> 05:48.449
YOU KNOW I CAN BE
A LITTLE COMPULSIVE.

05:48.449 --> 05:51.121
WAIT. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN
WITH MY RIGHT HAND IN MY POCKET.

05:51.121 --> 05:53.123
KARL! JUST GET OUT.

05:53.123 --> 05:54.555
OKAY, BUT FIRST...

05:54.555 --> 05:56.557
IF I HAVE TO TRACK YOU
TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH,

05:56.557 --> 05:58.028
AND IF IT TAKES ME
THE REST OF MY DAYS! BYE!

06:01.091 --> 06:02.433
THE SCHOOL CALLED.

06:02.433 --> 06:03.894
THEY SAID CHLOE WORE
HER COSTUME TO CLASS AGAIN.

06:03.894 --> 06:04.995
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA--

06:07.768 --> 06:10.971
PLEASE TELL ME
THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN
EVERY TIME I GO TO THE STORE.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.774
WELL, IF YOU HAD
READ MY THIRD BOOK,

06:13.774 --> 06:15.706
YOU'D KNOW EXACTLY WHY
I'M WEARING THIS.

06:15.706 --> 06:16.807
CHAPTER SEVEN:

06:16.807 --> 06:18.879
"SAY YES-UP
TO THE DRESS-UP."

06:37.568 --> 06:39.600
NOPE. STILL DON'T GET IT.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.874
LOOK, CHLOE WEARS
THE COSTUME TO MAKE HER
FEEL SPECIAL, RIGHT?

06:43.874 --> 06:47.708
IF I WEAR THE COSTUME, TOO.
IT WILL NO LONGER BE SPECIAL.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.810
AND SHE'LL LOSE HER REASON
FOR WEARING IT.

06:49.810 --> 06:53.143
SHE'LL REALIZE HER SPECIALNESS
COMES FROM WITHIN.

06:53.143 --> 06:54.545
REALLY?

06:54.545 --> 06:57.448
THAT'S IN HERE?

06:57.448 --> 06:58.619
KNOCKITY, KNOCKITY.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.651
OH, HI, KARL.
COME ON IN.

07:00.651 --> 07:03.594
MRS. JENNINGS, YOU LOOK ALMOST
CRIMINALLY PERFECT TODAY.

07:03.594 --> 07:06.627
THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU!

07:06.627 --> 07:08.459
AND YOU, DR. JAMES.

07:08.459 --> 07:10.601
IT'S NOT WHAT
IT LOOKS LIKE.

07:10.601 --> 07:13.964
REALLY? BECAUSE IT
LOOKS LIKE CHAPTER SEVEN
OF YOUR THIRD BOOK.

07:13.964 --> 07:15.806
BRILLIANT WORK, BY THE WAY.

07:15.806 --> 07:19.510
WHAT A LOVELY YOUNG MAN!

07:19.510 --> 07:21.942
I JUST STOPPED BY
BECAUSE I'M GOING
FOR MY AFTERNOON STROLL,

07:21.942 --> 07:23.774
AND I THOUGHT I COULD
TAKE STAN FOR A WALK.

07:23.774 --> 07:25.876
OH. STAN!
COME!

07:25.876 --> 07:28.619
HOW THOUGHTFUL OF YOU, KARL.

07:28.619 --> 07:32.823
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
CHLOE'S FAIRY DUST WORKED.

07:32.823 --> 07:35.155
STAN, WOULD YOU LIKE KARL
TO TAKE YOU FOR A WALK?

07:35.155 --> 07:36.787
YOU KIDDING?
AFTER WHAT HE DID TO AVERY?

07:36.787 --> 07:38.489
( barks )

07:38.489 --> 07:40.130
I GOT BACON TREATS.

07:40.130 --> 07:42.963
I MEAN, REALLY,
HOW BAD CAN HE BE?

07:50.871 --> 07:53.544
WHAT IS YOUR SECRET?

07:53.544 --> 07:54.605
WHAT IS IT?

07:54.605 --> 07:55.676
DO YOU HAVE...

07:55.676 --> 07:58.178
SUPER STRENGTH?
A MARSUPIAL POUCH?

07:58.178 --> 08:01.682
IF ONLY YOU COULD TALK,
YOU COULD JUST TELL ME.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.614
WHY AM I JUST LYING HERE?

08:03.614 --> 08:05.215
HERE, HAVE A BACON TREAT.

08:05.215 --> 08:07.217
OH, THAT'S WHY.

08:09.219 --> 08:11.021
YOU GIVE ME BACK MY DOG!

08:11.021 --> 08:12.122
HOW'D YOU FIND ME HERE?

08:12.122 --> 08:13.664
WE KNOCKED ON YOUR FRONT DOOR,

08:13.664 --> 08:16.226
AND YOUR MOM SAID YOU WERE
OUT BACK IN YOUR "EVIL LAIR."

08:17.267 --> 08:18.599
( intercom clicks )

08:18.599 --> 08:21.702
MOM, DO NOT REVEAL
MY WHEREABOUTS TO MY NEMESIS!

08:21.702 --> 08:23.934
THAT RIGHT THERE
IS WHY MY DAD IS IN SPACE.

08:25.235 --> 08:27.237
Karl's mom: SORRY, HONEY.
OH, BY THE WAY,

08:27.237 --> 08:29.179
YOUR UNDERPANTS WERE
ALL OVER THE BATHROOM FLOOR.

08:29.179 --> 08:30.541
MOM!

08:30.541 --> 08:33.213
HI, MRS. FINK.
AVERY JENNINGS HERE.

08:33.213 --> 08:35.586
HOW MANY PAIRS OF UNDERPANTS
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

08:35.586 --> 08:37.217
HMM. LOOKS LIKE ALL OF THEM.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.518
AHH!

08:38.518 --> 08:41.852
Karl: ( grunting )

08:41.852 --> 08:44.695
SO, WHERE WERE WE?

08:44.695 --> 08:47.027
LOOK, WE'RE TAKING HIM, KARL.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.058
GO AHEAD.

08:48.058 --> 08:49.660
YOUR EAGERNESS TO TAKE
THE DOG JUST PROVES

08:49.660 --> 08:51.531
I'M GETTING CLOSE
TO DISCOVERING...

08:51.531 --> 08:52.833
HE CAN FLY!

08:54.034 --> 08:56.066
NO!

08:56.066 --> 08:58.609
WELL, I WON'T REST
UNTIL I FIND OUT.

08:58.609 --> 09:01.672
I FINK, THEREFORE, I AM.

09:01.672 --> 09:03.113
I'M WORKING ON A CATCHPHRASE,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:09.179 --> 09:10.320
Bennett:
JUST LEAVE IT RIGHT THERE.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.052
I'LL PICK IT UP LATER.

09:12.052 --> 09:15.255
NOT REALLY DRESSED.

09:19.990 --> 09:22.162
OH... NO!

09:22.162 --> 09:23.193
( jiggling door handle )

09:25.295 --> 09:27.097
( sighs )

09:30.000 --> 09:31.842
HONEY!
YEAH, UM...

09:31.842 --> 09:34.675
FIRST OFF, YOUR "DELUXE STACKING
STORAGE FOOD CONTAINERS"

09:34.675 --> 09:35.946
ARRIVED, SO--

09:35.946 --> 09:38.008
YEAH! I KNOW.

09:38.008 --> 09:40.611
SECONDLY, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN YOU LOCKED YOURSELF OUT,

09:40.611 --> 09:43.313
AND I SAID "DON'T FORGET
TO PUT THE HIDE-A-KEY BACK"?

09:43.313 --> 09:45.956
YEAH... THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

09:45.956 --> 09:48.959
LOOK, WHEN ARE YOU
GOING TO BE HOME?

09:48.959 --> 09:50.861
YEAH... THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

09:52.723 --> 09:54.925
HONEY, DID YOU FORGET
TO TELL ME THAT
MY NEW PATIENTS CALLED

09:54.925 --> 09:57.728
AND MOVED THEIR
APPOINTMENT TO 4:30?

09:57.728 --> 10:00.070
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

10:01.802 --> 10:05.235
SO, I-I GUESS YOU'RE
PROBABLY GOING TO BE LOOKING
FOR A NEW CHILD PSYCHOLOGY--

10:05.235 --> 10:07.237
YEAH, THAT'S--THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.812
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

10:11.812 --> 10:15.245
KARL WON'T STOP UNTIL
HE KNOWS STAN'S SECRET.

10:15.245 --> 10:18.388
WHAT IF WE CONVINCE KARL
THAT STAN IS SPECIAL
FOR ANOTHER REASON?

10:18.388 --> 10:21.652
YEAH, LIKE I SPEAK
FLUENT ITALIAN.

10:21.652 --> 10:23.623
HE CAN'T KNOW
THAT YOU SPEAK AT ALL.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.354
CAPICHE?

10:25.756 --> 10:28.859
WHAT?

10:28.859 --> 10:31.702
YOU KNOW, KARL'S GOING TO BE
IN THE X-SQUARED GAMES SATURDAY.

10:31.702 --> 10:33.103
IF WE COULD GET...

10:33.103 --> 10:36.136
NO, STAN WOULD HAVE TO BE
GOOD AT MATH FOR THAT TO WORK.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.668
HOW DO YOU KNOW
I'M NOT GOOD AT MATH?

10:37.668 --> 10:40.671
WHAT'S 1250 TIMES 1250?

10:40.671 --> 10:42.642
OH, THAT'S MATH.

10:42.642 --> 10:46.046
NO, I'M--I'M DEFINITELY
BETTER AT ITALIAN.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.719
1,562,500

10:49.720 --> 10:51.381
I'M GUESSING.

10:51.381 --> 10:52.953
THAT'S RIGHT!

10:52.953 --> 10:55.686
WHAT'S 10,000
DIVIDED BY 33?

10:55.686 --> 10:57.127
HOW WOULD I KNOW?

10:57.127 --> 10:59.229
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M
A MATH GENIUS OR SOMETHING.

11:00.761 --> 11:04.795
303.0303.
REPEATING OF COURSE.

11:04.795 --> 11:07.067
THERE, YOU KNOW
MY DIRTY LITTLE SECRET.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.139
YOU'RE A MATH GENIUS?

11:09.139 --> 11:10.400
DON'T SAY THAT!

11:10.400 --> 11:12.142
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

11:12.142 --> 11:15.305
THIS IS SO UNFAIR!

11:15.305 --> 11:17.407
I'D LOVE TO BE A MATH GENIUS.

11:17.407 --> 11:21.151
I LISTEN TO SUBLIMINAL MATH CDS
IN MY SLEEP. AND NOTHING.

11:21.151 --> 11:22.753
EXCEPT FOR A RECURRING NIGHTMARE

11:22.753 --> 11:24.955
ABOUT BEING CHASED
BY THE NUMBER TWELVE.

11:24.955 --> 11:27.187
MAMMA MIA,
THAT'S A-SCARY.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.459
THAT WAS ITALIAN,
RIGHT?

11:29.459 --> 11:32.062
BUT I'M COOL.

11:32.062 --> 11:35.325
MATH AND COOL GO TOGETHER LIKE
OIL AND... THAT OTHER THING.

11:35.325 --> 11:36.396
WATER?
OH, NO, THANKS.

11:36.396 --> 11:39.069
I JUST HAD A GLASS.

11:39.069 --> 11:43.173
IF PEOPLE FIND OUT
I'M A MATH GENIUS,
I WON'T BE COOL ANYMORE.

11:43.173 --> 11:45.836
WELL, WHAT IF JUST
A FEW PEOPLE FOUND OUT?

11:45.836 --> 11:48.278
LOOK, I HAVE AN IDEA
ON HOW WE CAN USE THIS

11:48.278 --> 11:51.041
TO TAKE KARL DOWN
AT THE BIG MATH COMPETITION.

11:51.041 --> 11:53.784
BUT WE'RE GOING
TO NEED A LITTLE BIT
OF YOUR MATH GENIUS.

11:53.784 --> 11:55.385
ARE YOU SURE?
I MEAN,

11:55.385 --> 11:57.788
KARL'S PROBABLY
ALREADY FORGOTTEN
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

11:57.788 --> 12:00.220
( helicopter whirring )

12:00.220 --> 12:01.892
KARL...

12:01.892 --> 12:05.325
GET YOUR HELICOPTER OUT
OF HERE AND LEAVE US ALONE!

12:05.325 --> 12:07.427
Karl:
I WILL KNOW STAN'S SECRET!

12:10.000 --> 12:11.731
AM I THE ONLY ONE HERE
WHO'S AMAZED

12:11.731 --> 12:14.104
THAT KARL COULD FIT
INTO THAT TINY HELICOPTER?

12:21.812 --> 12:23.073
I'M TELLING YOU,

12:23.073 --> 12:25.175
THIS PLAN TO KEEP
STAN'S SECRET FROM KARL

12:25.175 --> 12:27.017
HAS GOT TO GO OFF
WITHOUT A HITCH.

12:27.017 --> 12:28.478
I AGREE.

12:28.478 --> 12:30.350
WHAT'S A HITCH?

12:30.350 --> 12:32.883
YOU ARE.
STOP INTERRUPTING.

12:32.883 --> 12:34.424
WE JUST HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

12:34.424 --> 12:37.257
YOU KNOW, KARL MAY BE A JERK,
BUT HE'S REALLY SMART.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.029
WHAT IF WE INVITE
KARL OVER HERE,

12:39.029 --> 12:41.031
AND THEN PUSH HIM
DOWN INTO SPAGHETTI?

12:41.031 --> 12:44.034
CHLOE, YOU'RE NOT HELPING.

12:44.034 --> 12:45.836
WE'RE TRYING TO COME UP
WITH SOMETHING REAL.

12:45.836 --> 12:46.967
SPAGHETTI IS REAL.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.498
I HAVE SOME IN MY POCKET.

12:49.499 --> 12:51.341
BLUEBERRIES...

12:51.341 --> 12:53.173
WRONG PANTS.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.405
GET OUT OF HERE, OKAY?

12:55.405 --> 12:56.776
THIS IS FOR THE BIG KIDS.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.880
FINE! NO ONE EVER
LISTENS TO ME!

13:03.253 --> 13:05.315
HMM, TROUBLE IN PARADISE.

13:05.315 --> 13:08.819
( knocking )

13:08.819 --> 13:09.820
COME IN, CHLOE.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.963
HOW DID YOU KNOW
IT WAS ME?

13:12.963 --> 13:14.825
JUST HOPING
BECAUSE I ADORE YOU.

13:15.866 --> 13:17.397
YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING:

13:17.397 --> 13:20.300
THE STEP-SISTER
OF MY NEMESIS
IS MY FRIEND.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.302
NOBODY LISTENS TO ME.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.275
I'LL LISTEN.
I AM A FANTASTIC LISTENER.

13:25.275 --> 13:28.178
Karl's mom on intercom:
KARL, I'M PINNED UNDER THE--

13:28.178 --> 13:29.880
YOU WERE SAYING?

13:29.880 --> 13:34.184
TYLER AND AVERY HAVE
A PLAN SO YOU WON'T
FIND OUT STAN'S SECRET.

13:34.184 --> 13:35.515
I HAVE A FUN NOTION.

13:35.515 --> 13:36.917
LET'S TRADE SECRETS.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.548
YOU GO FIRST.
OKAY.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.893
( muffled whispering )

13:42.893 --> 13:43.823
WHAT?

13:43.823 --> 13:44.925
REALLY?

13:44.925 --> 13:46.026
THAT'S STAN'S SECRET?

13:47.127 --> 13:49.599
I FIND THAT VERY HARD
TO BELIEVE, BUT STILL...

13:49.599 --> 13:51.101
HMMM...

13:51.101 --> 13:53.964
YOU DO REALIZE YOU SPIT
A LITTLE WHEN YOU SPEAK.

13:53.964 --> 13:56.336
WHAT WAS YOUR SECRET?

13:56.336 --> 13:59.870
SOMETIMES I SEND
YOUR MOTHER FLOWERS

13:59.870 --> 14:01.912
UNDER THE NAME
WALTER PERKINS.

14:01.912 --> 14:04.374
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHO HE IS!

14:04.374 --> 14:07.878
I DON'T KNOW!

14:13.924 --> 14:16.026
OKAY, YOU READY TO DO THIS?

14:16.026 --> 14:17.888
KARL'S OVER THERE WARMING UP.

14:17.888 --> 14:21.561
ONE-ONE-ONE-ONE,
TWO-TWO-TWO-TWO,

14:21.561 --> 14:23.233
THREE-THREE-THREE-THREE...

14:23.233 --> 14:25.135
MAN, LOOK
AT ALL THESE NERDS.

14:25.135 --> 14:26.366
I CAN'T EVEN
COUNT THEM ALL.

14:26.366 --> 14:30.000
YES, I CAN.
15. DARN IT!

14:30.000 --> 14:31.902
WHAT IF MY FRIENDS
SEE ME HERE?

14:31.902 --> 14:33.603
TYLER, IT'S OKAY.

14:33.603 --> 14:36.246
IT'S SATURDAY, IT'S SCHOOL,
AND IT'S A MATH CONTEST.

14:36.246 --> 14:38.348
NONE OF YOUR AIRHEAD FRIENDS
WILL BE HERE.

14:38.348 --> 14:40.280
EXCEPT THEM.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.411
HEY, TYLER.

14:41.411 --> 14:43.613
DID YOU COME TO MAKE FUN
OF THE MATH GEEKS, TOO?

14:43.613 --> 14:44.884
ALREADY DID.

14:44.884 --> 14:45.885
PANTSED THREE OF THEM.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.417
OR WAS IT FOUR?
I DON'T KNOW.

14:47.417 --> 14:49.659
I'M NOT GOOD AT MATH.
SEE YA!

14:49.659 --> 14:51.191
TYLER!

14:51.191 --> 14:53.063
COME ON!

14:53.063 --> 14:54.494
THIS IS FOR STAN.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.326
IF KARL FINDS OUT THE TRUTH,

14:56.326 --> 14:57.897
WE'RE GOING
TO LOSE HIM FOREVER.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.229
BUT...

14:59.229 --> 15:00.931
PLEASE.

15:05.075 --> 15:06.376
ACTUALLY...

15:06.376 --> 15:08.508
I'M HERE TO COMPETE.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.280
WHAT?

15:10.280 --> 15:13.013
MATH IS COOL?

15:14.084 --> 15:15.145
HEY, GUYS!

15:15.145 --> 15:16.947
TYLER'S DOING MATH.

15:16.947 --> 15:18.949
MATH IS COOL.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.921
HOW DID YOU WALK IN HERE,

15:21.921 --> 15:24.554
AND IN, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES
MAKE MATH COOL?

15:24.554 --> 15:27.527
SAME WAY YOU MADE HIP HOP
UNCOOL IN FIVE MINUTES

15:27.527 --> 15:29.699
WHEN YOU RAPPED
THE PERIODIC TABLE.

15:29.699 --> 15:32.202
( rapping to music )
♪ I BUST MY RHYMES LIKE HELIUM ♪

15:32.202 --> 15:35.105
♪ BUT THEY'RE MINE
SO DON'T STEAL-Y 'EM ♪

15:35.105 --> 15:37.167
♪ PER-I-OD...ICAL ♪

15:37.167 --> 15:39.169
( microphone feedback )

15:42.572 --> 15:45.115
COME ON, HONEY.
Ellen:
I DON'T WANT TO.

15:45.115 --> 15:48.018
I TOLD YOU, WHEN CHLOE
SAW JUST ME WEARING IT,

15:48.018 --> 15:49.519
IT STILL SEEMED SPECIAL.

15:49.519 --> 15:51.581
SHE NEEDS TO SEE
THAT EVERYBODY'S DOING IT.

15:54.985 --> 15:56.726
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
TAKE HER OUT OF THAT SCHOOL.

15:56.726 --> 15:58.328
I CAN HOMESCHOOL HER.

15:58.328 --> 15:59.990
'CAUSE THIS IS TORTURE.

15:59.990 --> 16:03.593
ELLEN,
YOU LOOK RAVISHING.

16:03.593 --> 16:05.535
I DO?
MM-HMM.

16:05.535 --> 16:08.999
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S THE BOOTS
OR THE HAREM PANTS,

16:08.999 --> 16:11.041
BUT YOU ARE
WORKING THAT, BABE.

16:11.041 --> 16:14.304
AH... I DO KIND OF FEEL
A TEENY BIT MAGICAL.

16:14.304 --> 16:16.046
YOU DON'T THINK
THE TIARA'S TOO MUCH?

16:16.046 --> 16:18.008
MAYBE FOR A LESSER WOMAN.

16:19.109 --> 16:20.650
( singsongy )
I'M A PRINCESS.

16:20.650 --> 16:23.983
I'M A SPECIAL,
MAGICAL PRINCESS.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.015
OH! LOOK AT ME!

16:25.015 --> 16:26.516
I CAN REALLY MOVE
IN THESE PANTS.

16:26.516 --> 16:27.557
UH-HUH!

16:27.557 --> 16:30.290
Both: OH OH OH!

16:30.290 --> 16:34.494
WHAT WAS I THINKING? AHH!

16:36.526 --> 16:39.129
HUH? MY PLAN WORKED.

16:39.129 --> 16:41.131
OR WE MADE IT LOOK
SO RIDICULOUS,

16:41.131 --> 16:43.073
SHE'S HUMILIATED TO LOOK
ANYTHING LIKE US.

16:43.073 --> 16:44.234
WHO CARES?

16:44.234 --> 16:46.076
WE WERE HAVING FUN
THERE A MOMENT AGO,

16:46.076 --> 16:47.077
WEREN'T WE? HUH?

16:47.077 --> 16:48.378
YEAH, IT WAS
KIND OF FUN.

16:48.378 --> 16:49.779
HMM. SO TELL ME...

16:49.779 --> 16:52.042
DID YOU EVER
DANCE LIKE THIS...

16:52.042 --> 16:54.144
Ellen: ( gasps )
WITH WALTER PERKINS?

16:54.144 --> 16:57.217
I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS!

16:57.217 --> 16:59.119
THIS CAME
FROM WALTER PERKINS.

17:02.592 --> 17:04.023
TYLER JAMES?
REALLY?

17:04.023 --> 17:05.095
YOU'RE COMPETING?

17:05.095 --> 17:07.097
I'M COMPETING,
AND I'M GONNA WIN.

17:07.097 --> 17:08.058
YOU DO REALIZE
THIS ISN'T

17:08.058 --> 17:10.260
A "POOFIEST HAIR-DO"
CONTEST?

17:10.260 --> 17:12.332
YEAH, I REALIZE THAT.

17:12.332 --> 17:15.435
I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT,
BUT I REALIZE IT.

17:15.435 --> 17:18.508
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LAST
PAST THE FIRST ROUND.

17:18.508 --> 17:19.709
FINAL ROUND.

17:19.709 --> 17:21.611
WE'RE DOWN TO OUR LAST
TWO CONTESTANTS.

17:23.373 --> 17:25.345
YAY, TYLER!
WHOO!

17:25.345 --> 17:27.417
THIS DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE AT ALL.

17:27.417 --> 17:30.180
HOW HAVE YOU NOT
BEEN ELIMINATED?

17:30.180 --> 17:31.621
( tense music begins )

17:39.589 --> 17:42.192
STAN IS HERE?

17:42.192 --> 17:44.194
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

17:44.194 --> 17:47.237
OKAY, THE NEXT QUESTION
IS FOR TYLER.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.503
( music intensifies,
no dialogue )

17:57.647 --> 17:59.249
22...
THAT'S RIGHT!

18:03.513 --> 18:05.815
SQUARE OVER TWO B.

18:32.582 --> 18:35.815
Tyler: 1.67 TIMES...

18:35.815 --> 18:36.846
THAT'S RIGHT.
( cheering )

18:36.846 --> 18:39.118
YES!
BUT, NO!

18:39.118 --> 18:40.650
NO, NO, NO!

18:40.650 --> 18:43.122
TYLER IS CHEATING!
HE IS A DIRTY CHEATER!

18:43.122 --> 18:45.195
THERE IS A DOG OUT THERE
GIVING HIM THE ANSWERS.

18:46.426 --> 18:49.159
NO. NO, REALLY.
THE DOG IS A MATH GENIUS!

18:49.159 --> 18:51.130
THE LITTLE GIRL IN THE RED
RUBBER RAIN BOOTS TOLD ME.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.363
( more laughter )

18:53.363 --> 18:55.905
MR. BEEDS,
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

18:55.905 --> 18:58.508
THE DOG IS CHEATING FOR HIM.
YOU HAVE TO DISQUALIFY TYLER.

18:58.508 --> 18:59.569
I WIN!

18:59.569 --> 19:00.840
OH, KARL.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.173
YOU MUST BE PRETTY DESPERATE
TO PULL SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

19:03.173 --> 19:05.275
YOU ARE DISQUALIFIED
FOR POOR SPORTSMANSHIP.

19:05.275 --> 19:06.346
WHA--

19:06.346 --> 19:09.219
TYLER IS THE WINNER
OF THE X-SQUARED GAMES!

19:09.219 --> 19:11.851
Audience: WHOO! YES!

19:11.851 --> 19:15.185
I'M GETTING A B-MINUS
IN GEOMETRY AND I DON'T
CARE WHO KNOWS IT!

19:15.185 --> 19:16.526
YAY, MATH!

19:16.526 --> 19:20.230
HA HA! YAY, MATH!

19:21.361 --> 19:22.892
SO, KARL...

19:22.892 --> 19:24.734
NEXT TIME WE GO HEAD TO HEAD,

19:24.734 --> 19:26.165
WHY DON'T YOU WIN?

19:26.165 --> 19:28.598
JUST TO MIX THINGS UP
A LITTLE BIT.

19:28.598 --> 19:29.869
YOU HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.242
ARE YOU CLAIMING
YOU SOMEHOW SET ME UP?

19:32.242 --> 19:34.204
DIDN'T I?

19:36.576 --> 19:38.208
Avery: IF ANYONE FINDS OUT
STAN'S SECRET...

19:38.208 --> 19:40.210
WHAT SECRET?!

19:40.210 --> 19:42.582
GET OUT OF HERE, OKAY?
THIS IS FOR THE BIG KIDS.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.316
FINE! NO ONE EVER
LISTENS TO ME!

19:47.317 --> 19:50.420
( whispering )
Stan is a math genius.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.425
HE'S JUST A REGULAR DOG.

19:55.425 --> 19:58.328
YOU PRETENDED HE HAD
A SECRET FROM THE BEGINNING
JUST TO SET THIS UP.

19:58.328 --> 19:59.429
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:59.429 --> 20:01.871
HIS "SECRET" WAS PART
OF AN ELABORATE RUSE

20:01.871 --> 20:03.433
TO COST YOU
THE MATH COMPETITION.

20:03.433 --> 20:06.276
OH! AND I DID EAT
YOUR GRAHAM CRACKERS.

20:07.307 --> 20:11.911
AND THEY WERE DE-LICIOUS.
MMM, MMM, MMM!

20:11.911 --> 20:14.244
BY THE WAY,
THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE.

20:14.244 --> 20:16.616
( auto-tuned ) Karl:
♪ THE DOG IS A MATH GENIUS ♪

20:16.616 --> 20:19.218
♪ DOG--DOG--DOG--DOG...
GENIUS ♪

20:19.218 --> 20:20.250
BAM!

20:20.250 --> 20:21.251
( whack )

20:22.752 --> 20:24.394
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
THE LAST OF ME!

20:24.394 --> 20:26.426
BECAUSE YOUR MOM AND DAD
INVITED ME OVER FOR DINNER.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.897
I'M MAKING MY FLAN.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.302
WASN'T THAT YOUR PHONE,
AVERY?

20:32.302 --> 20:34.364
DON'T RUIN THE MOMENT.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.638
IT WORKED!

20:38.638 --> 20:41.271
KARL THINKS THE WHOLE SECRET
WAS FAKE FROM THE BEGINNING.

20:41.271 --> 20:43.943
THANKS FOR RISKING
BEING UNCOOL.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.745
HEY, FOR STAN...

20:45.745 --> 20:48.418
I'D DO ANYTHING.

20:48.418 --> 20:49.949
Stan:
SO IN THE END,

20:49.949 --> 20:54.424
THE WHOLE THING WAS...
MOLTO BUONO!

20:54.424 --> 20:58.288
( in Italian accent )
HEY! I CAN SPEAK-A ITALIANO!

20:58.288 --> 21:02.332
AW, I'M NOT SPEAKING ITALIAN.
WHO AM I KIDDING?

21:02.332 --> 21:03.693
OY VEY.

21:03.693 --> 21:04.764
HEY!

21:04.764 --> 21:07.897
I CAN SPEAK YIDDISH!

21:07.897 --> 21:12.572
THE POINT IS, EVERYTHING WORKED
OUT AND AVERY OUT-FINKED FINK.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.874
BUT... SHE STILL CAN'T RAP.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.045
( rapping to music )

21:16.045 --> 21:17.747

21:17.747 --> 21:18.848

21:18.848 --> 21:20.350

21:20.350 --> 21:21.451

21:21.451 --> 21:23.453
PROBLEM.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.387
CAN'T AFFORD TO BREAK
ANOTHER MIC.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.988
SAVING UP FOR A NEW PHONE.

21:32.422 --> 21:34.424
( in pirate accent )
ARRR, MATEY.

21:34.424 --> 21:36.796
WHERE BE ME BREAKFAST?

21:39.298 --> 21:41.431
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

21:41.431 --> 21:43.973
( making indistinct
pirate noises )

21:43.973 --> 21:47.377
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

21:49.809 --> 21:51.511
ALL RIGHT.
( sighs )
