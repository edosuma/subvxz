01:18.120 --> 01:19.860
Don't listen to the haters, Norm.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.860
You're a polar bear. You got this.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.820
I mean, look at those paws.

01:23.920 --> 01:25.809
You're an animal... literally.

01:26.160 --> 01:28.811
It's an all-you-can-eat seal buffet.

01:29.520 --> 01:30.681
Go fill your plate.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.300
Read 'em and weep, boys.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.801
Cari-boo-yah! Full house.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.260
I'd bet antlers he fails again.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.540
Ah, he looks hungry.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.340
I'm giving ten-to-one odds
he catches the poor pinniped.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.805
They say I can't hunt.

02:06.280 --> 02:09.681
Oy, phooey! How can I be king
if I can't hunt?

02:28.640 --> 02:30.540
This is gonna hurt.

02:30.640 --> 02:31.971
Oh!

02:33.920 --> 02:35.100
That wasn't so bad.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.565
Oy, that was bad.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.565
They say he doesn't have any focus.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.860
Huh? Hi, Elizabeth.

02:44.960 --> 02:45.927
Hi.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.526
Augh!

02:50.480 --> 02:52.562
Jeez, it's like pure ice up here.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.580
An accident waiting to happen, you know?

02:54.680 --> 02:56.580
I mean, somebody should really
do something about this, huh?

02:56.680 --> 02:58.011
Ahem. Lemmings.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.660
Anyway, I really should get goin' now.

03:09.760 --> 03:12.380
I've got a seal to go catch
and eat and I...

03:12.480 --> 03:16.121
anyway, I uh... See ya, gotta go.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.324
Bye now. Catch ya later, Elizabeth.

03:28.680 --> 03:30.020
Babe, look! A hunt!

03:30.120 --> 03:32.282
This trip is finally payin' off.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.689
Any last words before I eat you?

03:45.840 --> 03:47.922
Oh, come on. Don't say that.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.487
You always know exactly
what to say to get to me.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.540
Eat him. Eat him!

03:53.640 --> 03:55.085
- Yeah! Eat him.
- Eat him!

03:57.200 --> 03:58.820
You wanna know why I'm not gonna eat you?

03:58.920 --> 04:01.540
You got a minute? Well, maybe an hour.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.086
It all started when I turned 13.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.380
In health class they told us
how our growl would change,

04:08.480 --> 04:10.540
how we'd start getting
more fur on our bodies.

04:10.640 --> 04:13.211
But they didn't say anything
about speaking to humans.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.841
I want one! I want one!
I want one! I want one!

04:20.800 --> 04:23.060
Aren't they supposed to stay
50 yards away?

04:23.160 --> 04:27.131
If this little brat takes one more step,
I'm gonna pounce.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.180
Keep it up, kid.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.740
The only thing you're gonna get
is a mauling.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.286
Can't ya see we're wild animals here?

04:36.280 --> 04:38.580
Did you just talk to me?

04:38.680 --> 04:40.887
Wait. You can speak bear?

04:41.920 --> 04:44.730
No, dummy, you're speaking human.

04:48.920 --> 04:50.140
I didn't know what to do.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.971
No other bear seemed to be able
to speak human.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.282
And certainly no other bear
had these weird feelings that I had.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.731
So I went to go see
the wisest bear in the world.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.480
The King of the Arctic,

05:02.960 --> 05:05.042
who conveniently was also my grandpa.

05:09.680 --> 05:12.500
I don't know what to do.
I didn't ask for this.

05:12.600 --> 05:13.940
What is wrong with me?

05:14.040 --> 05:17.140
Nothing is wrong with you, Norm.
You're special.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.891
Yeah, a real one of a kind.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.700
Actually, more like two of a kind.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.660
I share the same trait.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.500
I, too, can speak to our human visitors.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.340
You can talk to them, too?

05:29.440 --> 05:30.930
I can.

05:31.680 --> 05:34.500
Polar bears are icons of the Arctic, Norm.

05:34.600 --> 05:38.620
And an icon with a voice
can be very powerful indeed.

05:38.720 --> 05:42.770
Our land is vulnerable
and we're responsible.

05:44.440 --> 05:48.260
For now' just know
that what you and I have

05:48.360 --> 05:49.620
is a great gift.

05:49.720 --> 05:53.520
One day you'll truly understand.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.929
But when will I understand?

05:56.240 --> 05:57.740
But it didn't end there.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.764
Human tendencies had taken over my body.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.810
That's when I started doing
the Arctic Shake.

06:06.280 --> 06:07.340

06:24.200 --> 06:26.580
These days, I'm pretty glad
I have these feelings,

06:26.680 --> 06:28.580
but I just don't know
what to do with them.

06:28.680 --> 06:29.841
And that brings me to the other day.

06:39.040 --> 06:42.010
Why don't you take a picture?
It'll last longer.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.140
I knew he wouldn't kill the seal.

06:45.240 --> 06:48.060
- Pay up.
- Fine, here.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.242
You're lucky these things grow back.

07:01.640 --> 07:05.100
I'm a bear who can't hunt.
I'm softer than frozen yogurt.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.340
Who needs a bear with too much care

07:07.440 --> 07:08.780
and not enough scare?

07:08.880 --> 07:11.690
Norm! What is that, a haiku?

07:12.320 --> 07:13.890
What did Dad tell you
about writing poetry?

07:14.560 --> 07:17.780
I know, I know. "Leave the poetry
to the panda bears."

07:17.880 --> 07:18.980
What's up, Stan?

07:19.080 --> 07:21.128
I only caught the tail end of it...

07:21.600 --> 07:24.490
but I made some money
off your failed hunt today, big bro.

07:25.960 --> 07:28.100
I wish I'd caught the tail end of my hunt.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.900
Let me give you some advice, bro.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.411
Act with your stomach and not your heart.

07:38.640 --> 07:41.420
Oh, my 5:00 is here. Excuse me, Normie.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.620
I don't know why you spend so much
time and energy on these tourists.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.085
They're ruining it up here.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.328
Au contraire, mon frere.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.940
As Dad always said,
"If humans come to our land and clap,

07:52.040 --> 07:53.860
they can't come to our land and crap."

07:53.960 --> 07:55.780
"Give them a scene...

07:55.880 --> 07:58.020
the Arctic stays clean."

07:58.120 --> 08:00.900
Thanks, Stan, I got it.
But Grandpa always said...

08:01.000 --> 08:02.660
Enough about Grandpa, Norm.

08:02.760 --> 08:03.900
He left us, remember?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.764
He's not here. We are.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.760
The humans won't destroy
something they love.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.606
And they love...

08:11.080 --> 08:12.161
us!

08:13.640 --> 08:17.100
Let's give these people what they came
a thousand miles to see:

08:17.200 --> 08:18.531
a show!

08:18.800 --> 08:21.007
And go!

08:39.480 --> 08:40.640
Whoa!

08:46.240 --> 08:47.700
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.768

09:04.120 --> 09:05.804
Act real.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.500
Ohh! Not that real!

09:15.600 --> 09:17.500
Aw, that's the fourth time this month.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.780
Norm, I need you for the finale.

09:19.880 --> 09:22.300
I'm desperate. A whale just ate my actor.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.020
This is my nightmare.

09:24.120 --> 09:26.500
Aww, please.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.620
No, the Arctic Shake
was for your bachelor party.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.820
I'd never do that for the human tourists.

- That bear's not scary at all.

10:03.640 --> 10:07.326
He doesn't belong in the Arctic,
he belongs on Broadway.

10:08.280 --> 10:09.247
Right?

10:13.280 --> 10:16.045
Hey, hey, can you do the Charleston?

10:31.200 --> 10:33.940
Socrates! O wisest of the winged,

10:34.040 --> 10:35.246
brainiest of the beaked.

10:36.120 --> 10:39.620
Caw! Norm, grab a seat.

10:39.720 --> 10:42.246
Be with you in a minute.
Just finishing up.

10:43.680 --> 10:45.580
And the next thing you know, I'm twerking

10:45.680 --> 10:47.620
in front of a boatload of human tourists.

10:47.720 --> 10:50.620
Twerking! Have some self-respect, Norm.

10:50.720 --> 10:54.300
I just don't know why everyone wants
to be so nice to these intruders.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.300
They've never done anything for us
except to come to our land uninvited.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.980
Ah, your grandfather had a saying...

11:01.080 --> 11:02.764
"Panem et circenses."

11:03.440 --> 11:04.660
"Bread and circuses."

11:04.760 --> 11:08.260
He meant it's easier to distract
ourselves with food and entertainment

11:08.360 --> 11:10.780
than to think about the real problems.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.700
What happened to Grandpa, Socrates?

11:12.800 --> 11:14.500
Did he really just disappear?

11:14.600 --> 11:15.965
The theories are plentiful.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.260
Some believe he's on a vision quest.

11:18.360 --> 11:20.940
Some people think he simply
went to search for fish,

11:21.040 --> 11:23.540
while others think he went
to follow the band...

11:23.640 --> 11:24.687
Phish.

11:25.520 --> 11:29.081
Me, I think your grandpa knew
something was happening

11:29.320 --> 11:30.380
and tried to fight it.

11:30.480 --> 11:33.689
And it looks like that something
is happening.

11:47.680 --> 11:50.809
Holy icicle. Is that a human house?

11:51.520 --> 11:53.420
It's a model home.

11:53.520 --> 11:54.760
A sales tool.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.402
Just arrived, literally,
fresh on the boat.

11:59.840 --> 12:02.740
It means more of these houses
are gonna be coming.

12:02.840 --> 12:05.660
Humans are moving here? To live?

12:05.760 --> 12:07.820
It starts with the tourists,

12:07.920 --> 12:10.380
then someone says,
"I could do this year round."

12:10.480 --> 12:13.020
It happened to my buddy,
Freddy the flamingo.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.180
He was in Florida,
minding his own business.

12:15.280 --> 12:16.180
Couple of tourists show up.

12:16.280 --> 12:19.540
Next thing you know,
there are plastic statues of Freddy

12:19.640 --> 12:20.880
on everyone's lawn!

12:30.440 --> 12:32.010
We gotta talk to the king.

12:34.960 --> 12:38.806
Norm, that house has nothing to do
with why Grandpa vanished.

12:41.840 --> 12:44.660
Dad, you're not listening, there's more.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.620
There's a human house
right here on Grandpa's land.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.563
Humans are moving here now.

12:53.480 --> 12:57.860
Ah, Norm, you always did have
such an imagination, now, didn't you?

12:57.960 --> 13:01.420
- First with the poetry...
- I swear it's true.

13:01.520 --> 13:04.205
Socrates and I snuck in. And look...

13:04.720 --> 13:06.085
from Florida.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.580
Norm, you are not to go
anywhere near there.

13:19.680 --> 13:20.660
Do you hear me?

13:20.760 --> 13:23.684
Grandpa's land is off limits. Understood?

13:24.840 --> 13:25.940
"Snuck in."

13:26.040 --> 13:28.780
Ha! Norm, you shouldn't go onto property

13:28.880 --> 13:31.500
that doesn't belong to you.
You should know better.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.020
Besides, I'm sure the house
you're referring to

13:34.120 --> 13:36.088
is simply a research hut.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.580
Look, son, you wanna be king?

13:38.680 --> 13:41.620
A future king isn't supposed
to get so emotional.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.220
We hunt, we lead, and we sleep. Simple!

13:44.320 --> 13:46.020
Now there is plenty of ice to go around.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.700
Just stay away from there! Far away.

13:48.800 --> 13:51.620
And for the love of salmon,
no more talking human!

13:51.720 --> 13:53.180
You got me?

13:53.280 --> 13:55.009
Yes, Dad.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.660
Did you see that?
He wants to give away the Arctic.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.060
That's it. We're done.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.500
Norm, it all points to the same thing.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.660
Humans are invading our land.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.380
And you are a polar bear
who can speak to humans.

14:23.480 --> 14:26.060
You're the only one who can
do something about this.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.970
Socrates, I can't even hunt.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.140
Norm, your grandpa once told me,

14:34.240 --> 14:39.246
"Norm's the only bear that has
the potential to be king of the Arctic.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.820
"He feels the Arctic's pain.

14:42.920 --> 14:47.050
And if he feels it enough,
he'll stand for us."

14:50.840 --> 14:52.780
I can't even stand for myself.

14:52.880 --> 14:54.780
Norm, don't listen to them.

14:54.880 --> 14:57.660
They're just furry robots
sitting in their ice cubicles

14:57.760 --> 14:58.820
obeying the rules,

14:58.920 --> 15:01.620
pretending nothing bad's
ever gonna happen.

15:01.720 --> 15:04.380
But you can change the rules.

15:04.480 --> 15:07.802
You're seeing the future.
They're just living in the past.

15:08.120 --> 15:10.220
You can find a new way.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.220
Don't just dance for the humans.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.402
Fight for our home instead.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.485
Okay. I won't let you down.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.284
- Socrates!
- Cranberries!

15:31.800 --> 15:35.691
Surprise is the number-one cause
of death in the elderly, you know.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.300
Ooh...

15:37.400 --> 15:38.940
We have to do something.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.940
I have to do something. Unh!

15:41.040 --> 15:43.220
Ah, number one or number two?

15:43.320 --> 15:46.210
- We gotta take some...
- Action!

15:52.840 --> 15:54.060
What the heck is that?

15:54.160 --> 15:57.780
Caw! That is proof of why
you should stay in school.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.420
First you're cutting class,
next you're dressing up in a bear suit

16:00.520 --> 16:02.500
doing twirls for a real estate commercial.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.020
The seals would kill him.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.087
Cut!

16:06.040 --> 16:08.500
Who said that?
I'm the only one who yells, "Cut!"

16:08.600 --> 16:09.886
I'm the director.

16:12.840 --> 16:16.340
I'm not just going to be a furry robot
sitting in an ice cubicle.

16:16.440 --> 16:19.091
We have to point that director
in a new direction.

16:25.560 --> 16:26.500
Oh, great.

16:26.600 --> 16:30.605
A suit coming to give me creative notes
on my masterpiece!

16:57.000 --> 16:59.260
But I'll need soldiers on the ground.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.486
Invisible soldiers.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.940
Those little guys? They'll get crushed.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.929
Trust me, they're indestructible.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.380
- What's he doing?
- He wants you to stomp on him.

17:15.480 --> 17:16.845
He wants to prove how tough he is.

17:19.240 --> 17:20.660
Could he sign a release first?

17:20.760 --> 17:22.579
I'm gonna get, like,
lemming juice everywhere.

17:22.680 --> 17:23.681
Do it.

17:25.240 --> 17:26.969
- Ow.
- I killed him.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.700
If I go down, Socrates,
I'm taking you down with me!

17:29.800 --> 17:31.768
Wait for it. Wait for it.

17:34.640 --> 17:35.700
Ta-da!

17:35.800 --> 17:38.201
You're invincible.
You guys got springs for bones.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.780
Can you see this, honey?
It's so beautiful' isn't it?

17:46.880 --> 17:49.460
It's beautiful, Mom,
but what will it look like

17:49.560 --> 17:51.860
when you and Mr. Greene
build all those houses there?

17:51.960 --> 17:54.900
You're changing the Arctic.
Change isn't always good.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.140
Olympia, if this campaign works
and the houses sell,

17:58.240 --> 17:59.924
that means great things for us.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.284
But it really is amazing up here.

18:02.680 --> 18:03.966
Oh!

18:04.880 --> 18:07.300
Olympia, I'll call you right back.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.260
Hi. Vera Brightly,

18:09.360 --> 18:10.980
Head of Marketing for Mr. Greene.

18:11.080 --> 18:13.900
The commercial is a masterpiece!
I deserve an Oscar!

18:14.000 --> 18:17.060
Well, you can't win an Oscar
for a commercial,

18:17.160 --> 18:20.721
but as long as it can sell condos,
we've done our job.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.020
Can you smell that?

18:24.120 --> 18:25.820
The air is so fresh here.

18:25.920 --> 18:27.809
It's completely unpolluted.

18:31.880 --> 18:34.700
Holy Hitchcock!
That bird just pooped on me.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.848
I think that's good luck, isn't it?

18:53.720 --> 18:55.220
Who forgot to secure the lights?

18:55.320 --> 18:57.766
I swear I secured them.

19:00.920 --> 19:02.649
Is that bird aiming for us?

19:05.240 --> 19:06.366
Oh, poop.

19:21.320 --> 19:22.820
Oh, my gosh. What is happening?

19:22.920 --> 19:24.580
Vera, we're fine.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.489
I still have the background lights.

19:37.400 --> 19:39.368
Wait for it. Wait for it.

19:55.240 --> 19:57.100
Don't tell me those were
the background lights.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.820
Don't worry, Vera.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.700
I've already shot most of the commercial,

20:00.800 --> 20:02.370
and it's all on this reel.

20:11.480 --> 20:12.660
We'll fix the rest in post.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.060
Anything can be fixed in post.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.820
In one of my movies,
I wrote the plot in post.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.900
Uh, excuse me, Nigel.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.140
Vera, a director always delivers
and never quits.

20:23.240 --> 20:24.844
There goes the footage.

20:25.160 --> 20:27.060
Augh! I quit! I quit!

20:27.160 --> 20:29.420
You can't quit.
We have a one-day film permit,

20:29.520 --> 20:31.090
and the house goes back
to New York tonight.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.860
Au revoir, as they say in France

20:33.960 --> 20:35.564
and some parts of Canada!

20:52.880 --> 20:55.724
Good job today, lemmings,
but let's not get too comfortable.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.620
Yup, there's one more down there.
Oh, sorry about that.

20:59.720 --> 21:01.020
You guys gotta speak up, seriously.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.963
If you're gonna go to the bottom,
tell somebody.

21:05.560 --> 21:07.180
Let's not completely relax

21:07.280 --> 21:09.601
until "Pretty in Pink"
heads back to America.

21:09.880 --> 21:12.180
Okay, Vera, you're a problem solver.

21:12.280 --> 21:14.980
When you're faced with a problem,
what do you usually do?

21:15.080 --> 21:16.241
You solve it!

21:16.960 --> 21:19.660
If only I had some seals and ice

21:19.760 --> 21:22.366
and, uh, are there penguins up here?

21:31.640 --> 21:32.740
Sea lion! Hi!

21:32.840 --> 21:33.700
Please come back.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.700
I need your help with this shot. Please?

21:35.800 --> 21:38.300
It's a seal, you generalist.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.528
Humans think all animals look the same.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.300
Ouch! Cracked driveway.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.980
Not a good selling point.

21:49.080 --> 21:51.220
Hey, the Arctic comes as-is.

21:51.320 --> 21:52.765
Who said that?

21:56.080 --> 21:57.300
Mommy.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.180
Sorry, honey.
Mommy couldn't call you back.

21:59.280 --> 22:01.180
I was busy putting out a fire.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.180
The Arctic is on fire?!

22:03.280 --> 22:05.700
Wait, so you're melting it now?

22:05.800 --> 22:08.620
No, no, not real fires.
Everything is fine, sweetie.

22:08.720 --> 22:09.960
I'm totally fine.

22:12.360 --> 22:13.540
Wha?

22:13.640 --> 22:14.641
Oh, no!

22:15.760 --> 22:16.980
Move it, lady!

22:17.080 --> 22:18.460
Oh, no.

22:18.560 --> 22:19.721
A polar bear!

22:19.960 --> 22:23.740
Really? Oh, they're amazing.
Ursus Maritimus.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.740
I think he's charging me. Is that bad?

22:25.840 --> 22:27.020
Look it up on the Internet.

22:27.120 --> 22:30.180
It says, "When confronted
with a polar bear,

22:30.280 --> 22:32.362
assert dominance and stand your ground."

22:36.040 --> 22:37.724
I don't think it's working.

22:42.200 --> 22:45.010
Let me call you back, honey.
Mommy has an idea. Love you.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.446
Tired of suburbia?

22:47.640 --> 22:50.723
Come to the Arctic, where every day
is a safari in the snow.

22:54.480 --> 22:57.290
All you need to do is step
outside your front door, literally.

23:24.720 --> 23:27.405
Waterfront property now available.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.605
You're welcome!

23:46.440 --> 23:48.460
Mr. Greene, we've had
some problems up here.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.420
Oh, Vera, my dear-a,
there are no problems,

23:51.520 --> 23:53.460
only messages from the universe.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.220
Om...

23:55.320 --> 23:57.660
Say it with me, Vera. Om...

23:57.760 --> 23:59.020
Om...

23:59.120 --> 24:00.460
Mr. Greene, the director quit!

24:00.560 --> 24:02.289
What?!

24:04.240 --> 24:05.700
I knew you shouldn't have hired

24:05.800 --> 24:07.370
that overpaid, pretentious...

24:08.280 --> 24:09.566
Okay, how are you gonna fix this?

24:09.840 --> 24:12.180
How are you gonna fix your fault? Hmm?

24:12.280 --> 24:13.700
Well, I've been filming all day,

24:13.800 --> 24:15.980
and I got some really great
footage of a polar bear

24:16.080 --> 24:17.161
that almost attacked me.

24:17.440 --> 24:18.460
You've been filming?

24:18.560 --> 24:20.460
That is so cute.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.060
I'm sure you think
you're a regular Scorsese.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.970
All right, I need something people
might actually wanna watch.

24:28.640 --> 24:31.260
Wait a tick. I love it.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.740
I love it. I love it!

24:33.840 --> 24:35.420
This bear is a star.

24:35.520 --> 24:38.100
"Safari in the snow."

24:38.200 --> 24:39.611
Genius of me.

24:40.040 --> 24:43.089
This will definitely get me approval
from the Polar Council.

24:43.800 --> 24:45.086
I can't believe it.

24:45.240 --> 24:46.685
Oh, I'm gonna be so rich.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.300
Condos, shopping malls, Volvo dealerships.

24:50.400 --> 24:53.131
Oh, God, you name it.
It's going to be Dubai on ice.

24:56.080 --> 24:58.580
Bring the commercial and the model
back home to New York

24:58.680 --> 25:00.860
and I'll see you tomorrow, mañana.

25:00.960 --> 25:02.300
That means "morning," I think.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.260
Remember, we have one week
to get this approved.

25:05.360 --> 25:08.060
Actually, Mr. Greene, while I have you,

25:08.160 --> 25:09.700
any word back from your alma mater,

25:09.800 --> 25:11.260
the Magister Mundi Academy?

25:11.360 --> 25:12.940
It's Olympia's dream to go there,

25:13.040 --> 25:14.820
but as you know, it's impossible to get in

25:14.920 --> 25:16.649
without an alumni recommendation.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.420
Yeah, but she ain't gettin' in
until the condos get in.

25:20.520 --> 25:23.220
I won't let you down, I promise.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.620
Vera, scrap the campaign.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.900
We need a real symbol of the Arctic

25:27.000 --> 25:28.420
who can talk to these people

25:28.520 --> 25:31.260
and convince these morons to buy my homes.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.840
Find an actor who looks
just like that bear.

25:34.120 --> 25:37.700
Let's use the Arctic to sell the Arctic.

25:37.800 --> 25:38.801
Boo-yah!

25:42.040 --> 25:44.122
An actor that looks just like that bear?

25:45.040 --> 25:46.246
Oh, brother.

25:52.680 --> 25:54.060
You heard them, Norm.

25:54.160 --> 25:56.460
They want an actor who can use the Arctic

25:56.560 --> 25:57.740
to sell the Arctic.

25:57.840 --> 25:59.380
If that actor is you,

25:59.480 --> 26:02.768
we can use the Arctic to save the Arctic.

26:02.960 --> 26:05.140
You need to go to New York

26:05.240 --> 26:08.926
and stop these houses
from ever getting here.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.364
I hear they have good pizza in New York.

26:44.560 --> 26:45.846

28:02.520 --> 28:05.300
Lemmings, I have a feeling this journey

28:05.400 --> 28:07.300
might not be as smooth as we hoped.

28:07.400 --> 28:09.050
Just got to remember to stay...

28:10.320 --> 28:11.446
grounded.

28:22.880 --> 28:24.086
Whoa!

28:51.400 --> 28:54.260
This place is so amazing, Mom.

28:54.360 --> 28:56.780
Did you know that their Latin
department is so good,

28:56.880 --> 28:59.500
they single-handedly
resuscitated the language?

28:59.600 --> 29:02.340
- It's no longer dead.
- Well, it's a school for only

29:02.440 --> 29:06.240
the gifted and talented geniuses
like you. It really is perfect.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.900
But try not to fall in love
just yet, okay?

29:10.000 --> 29:10.860
This is only a tour.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.340
We still need Mr. Greene's help and...

29:12.440 --> 29:14.700
Mom, you're putting
too much pressure on yourself.

29:14.800 --> 29:18.140
We don't need Greene's help.
I can get in on my own.

29:18.240 --> 29:19.241
I know it.

29:21.640 --> 29:23.324
Just have fun in there, sweetheart.

29:56.320 --> 29:57.700
It's the most amazing thing.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.300
I gotta tell all my seal buddies.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.164
You press the lever, the water goes up.

30:06.280 --> 30:09.220
Um, oh, hey, guys. Come on in.

30:09.320 --> 30:11.891
Um, help yourself to some
fur balls in the fridge.

30:16.120 --> 30:17.860
Another talking bear?

30:17.960 --> 30:19.420
We gotta tell Mr. Greene.

30:19.520 --> 30:22.900
Wait. What do you mean,
"another talking bear"?

30:23.000 --> 30:24.047
Oh!

30:24.360 --> 30:26.044
Bring the tranquilizer guns. Over.

30:29.240 --> 30:30.207
Hyah!

30:42.600 --> 30:44.011
Whoa!

30:48.320 --> 30:49.810
Huh?

30:55.400 --> 30:57.900
Greene House Company, where art thou?

30:58.000 --> 31:01.209
The King of the Arctic
has come to greet you.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.888
Well, it's not "Macbeth," but it's a job.

31:06.280 --> 31:09.060
Okay, bad costume,
but he knows the way to Greene.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.400
- There he is!
- Huh?

31:11.320 --> 31:12.526
Come on, lemmings.

31:20.720 --> 31:22.927
Hey! Hah-ha-hah!

31:25.880 --> 31:27.740
Yes, I am the King of the Arctic,

31:27.840 --> 31:30.060
and the king is hungry!

31:30.160 --> 31:31.300
Sustenance!

31:31.400 --> 31:34.020
Hark! Seal, hark, I say!

31:34.120 --> 31:35.121
Hey, you!

31:41.400 --> 31:42.401
Hey!

31:47.160 --> 31:49.891
- There he is!
- I think we can take him.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.482
A real polar bear always
does his own stunts.

31:59.520 --> 32:02.729
Come here and feel my Arctic wrath.

32:03.320 --> 32:04.446
En garde!

32:05.360 --> 32:08.170
Jeez, they don't call this place
a "concrete jungle" for nothing.

32:16.720 --> 32:17.700
Whoa, yes!

32:17.800 --> 32:18.801
Hunh!

32:30.160 --> 32:31.980
It was just a misunderstanding.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.620
We thought you was a real talking bear.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.041
Thank you. That's a fantastic compliment.

32:49.680 --> 32:52.889
Aah! Mad rats! Mad rats!

32:54.640 --> 32:56.688
Yes! Run, cowards!

32:58.200 --> 32:59.531
Get back here, lemmings!

33:02.280 --> 33:04.300
So you're here for
the Greene Homes audition?

33:04.400 --> 33:06.060
"King of the Arctic," I take it.

33:06.160 --> 33:08.620
Yeah. Use the Arctic to sell the Arctic.

33:08.720 --> 33:09.780
It makes sense.

33:09.880 --> 33:12.281
Well, you certainly look
the part of a bear.

33:12.440 --> 33:15.100
That costume is exquisite.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.326
Just a little something I threw together.

33:18.160 --> 33:21.180
Yes...
I thought I had this role locked up,

33:21.280 --> 33:23.260
but now my bear suit is ruined.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.522
Oh, I'll never get this one.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.500
Look, when you were attacking those men,

33:27.600 --> 33:29.887
you really had me convinced
you were a bear.

33:30.120 --> 33:33.020
Yes, I am a phenomenal actor,

33:33.120 --> 33:34.860
but I can't compete with you.

33:34.960 --> 33:36.564
Such authenticity.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.140
You even smell like a polar bear.

33:40.240 --> 33:44.529
Me, I smell like macaroni
and sweet vermouth.

33:45.360 --> 33:48.284
Now go and get that part!

33:54.880 --> 33:57.260
Mr. Greene, let me be frank.

33:57.360 --> 34:00.980
Condos in the Arctic is a ludicrous idea.

34:01.080 --> 34:05.180
Now, condos in the Bahamas...
that people can understand.

34:05.280 --> 34:08.284
Until we can see public support,
we will not approve this.

34:08.520 --> 34:09.860
Polar Council, please.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.580
I do this all over the world.

34:11.679 --> 34:13.659
I know where people
want to live before they do.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.603
Our homes are very deluxe,

34:16.000 --> 34:19.060
and you would love them, Councilwoman.

34:19.159 --> 34:21.659
People aren't interested
in living in the Arctic.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.060
Know how I know?

34:23.159 --> 34:25.219
Because that graph shows you're currently

34:25.320 --> 34:27.288
at a 3% approval rating.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.284
Until that number gets above 85%...

34:31.800 --> 34:33.165
not approved.

34:39.719 --> 34:40.926
Hi, everyone.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.081
Sign in and wait over there, Travolta.

34:49.120 --> 34:52.283
Hey, guys. Toilet's right there.
Help yourselves.

35:05.880 --> 35:06.767
Whatever.

35:15.600 --> 35:16.580
Oh, yeah.

35:16.680 --> 35:19.340
Looks like we're real close
to approval, Vera.

35:19.440 --> 35:20.460
Great work.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.620
We need to get to 85%, and we're at what,

35:22.720 --> 35:23.900
2.8?

35:24.000 --> 35:25.540
Vera, where is my bear?

35:25.640 --> 35:27.580
Mr. Greene, I've got bear actors
from Broadway

35:27.680 --> 35:29.500
and the big screen coming right now.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.700
Well, I hope so. Because if you fail,

35:31.800 --> 35:33.500
you can kiss your daughter's chances

35:33.600 --> 35:35.020
of getting into my alma mater goodbye.

35:35.120 --> 35:36.700
Know what else you can kiss goodbye?

35:36.800 --> 35:37.780
Yo' job!

35:37.880 --> 35:39.460
'Cause I promise you, it will vanish,

35:39.560 --> 35:41.860
just like those condos we built
in the Bermuda Triangle.

35:41.960 --> 35:45.100
Mr. Greene, I have
the investors on Skype for you.

35:45.200 --> 35:48.500
Oh, great. The Arctic condo investors.

35:48.600 --> 35:50.682
And no approval for Arctic condos!

35:55.360 --> 35:58.460
Thank you all for coming.
Okay, we're looking for real.

35:58.560 --> 35:59.561
Let me have it!

36:04.160 --> 36:06.380
Okay, I'm not quite getting
"King of the Arctic."

36:06.480 --> 36:08.847
It's more like "Queen of the Prom."

36:09.040 --> 36:12.380
Bear, bear, bear, bear.

36:12.480 --> 36:15.643
I need real.
I need something to save my...

36:29.520 --> 36:30.780
You, come with me.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.500
Only if I can bring my lemmings.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.250
We're with the same agency.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.290
Cute. And very marketable. Bring 'em.

36:45.760 --> 36:49.651
Mr. Greene, meet Norm of the North.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.500
Yeah, he's pretty.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.420
And I feel scared. Ooh, ah.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.540
But can Norma play "King of the Arctic"?

37:03.640 --> 37:04.971
It's Norm.

37:06.520 --> 37:08.060
Aah! Help!

37:08.160 --> 37:09.260
Help! I'm being mugged!

37:09.360 --> 37:10.820
Just take the watch, take my wallet.

37:10.920 --> 37:12.740
Just don't touch my ponytail.
That's where...

37:12.840 --> 37:14.620
That's where I keep all my powers.

37:14.720 --> 37:16.420
Aah! Vera, Vera!

37:16.520 --> 37:19.205
Throw me my Mace! And my wet wipes!

37:21.080 --> 37:24.140
Sorry, Mr. Greene.
I was just, uh, keepin' it real.

37:24.240 --> 37:27.460
You know, trying to use the Arctic
to sell the Arctic, you know.

37:27.560 --> 37:30.220
Norm is just a consummate actor.
He certainly looks the part.

37:30.320 --> 37:33.130
And he even brought Arctic lemmings.

37:38.400 --> 37:40.820
Janet! The rats are back!
Call pest control,

37:40.920 --> 37:42.968
because the fire department
doesn't show up on time!

37:49.760 --> 37:52.445
Om... Gonna die.

37:52.840 --> 37:54.460
Mr. Greene, you said authentic sells,

37:54.560 --> 37:57.100
and no one does authentic better
than Norm of the North.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.740
Well, he's too authentic.

37:58.840 --> 38:00.820
I mean, we need a bear that is happy,

38:00.920 --> 38:02.940
that makes people feel warm and safe.

38:03.040 --> 38:04.940
You know, fake!

38:05.040 --> 38:07.140
You're fired, Norm. Get out of my office.

38:07.240 --> 38:08.940
- Om...
- You want happy bear?

38:09.040 --> 38:11.247
You got happy bear.

38:14.600 --> 38:15.980
♪ Let me speak free ♪

38:16.080 --> 38:19.420

38:34.200 --> 38:37.044
Norm, I take it back. You're hired.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.847
Vera, take our newest star out to lunch.

38:40.120 --> 38:42.940
Come on, Norm. We'll go
to Kozawa Sushi just upstairs.

38:43.040 --> 38:44.820
It's the freshest fish in town.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.900
Kozawa's pricey.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.220
Uh, okay... Vera,
can you come here for a second?

38:50.320 --> 38:52.980
Just no lobster, Kobe, or tipping, okay?

38:53.080 --> 38:54.900
By the way, Norm,
if you like mixed drinks,

38:55.000 --> 38:58.004
you must try the flat and sparkling water.

39:00.440 --> 39:02.860
That actor actually smells like a bear.

39:02.960 --> 39:04.883
I haven't smelled anything
that foul since...

39:05.720 --> 39:07.768
Wait a minute.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.241
Has he spoken again?

39:32.720 --> 39:34.688
Uh, nope.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.500
Something felt a little too real
with that bear.

39:38.600 --> 39:41.900
The only thing that looks like a bear,
sounds like a bear,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.140
and smells as bad as a bear

39:44.240 --> 39:45.844
is a bear.

39:46.840 --> 39:48.420
I knew it!

39:48.520 --> 39:50.340
You think you're real slick,
don't you, old bear?

39:50.440 --> 39:53.250
You thought you could send one of
your bear operatives to take me out?

39:56.160 --> 39:57.082
Snap!

39:57.560 --> 39:59.020
Well, I got news for you, Gramps.

39:59.120 --> 40:01.420
- No way I'm goin' down that easy.

40:01.520 --> 40:03.682
Norm of the North is finished.

40:04.080 --> 40:05.969
I've got a bear assassin to get rid of.

40:06.840 --> 40:08.171
Norm?

40:25.960 --> 40:28.361
He's an actor.
Never takes off his costume.

40:39.560 --> 40:41.085
Are you okay?

40:42.120 --> 40:44.691
I'm fine. I usually sit on the ground
at home anyway.

40:46.440 --> 40:50.860
Um... for an entrée,
you want to do chef's choice.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.900
He can always read what his guests want.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.700
Sure.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.220
This should be interesting.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.820
Sorry we couldn't bring the lemmings.

40:57.920 --> 40:59.340
A little health code thing.

40:59.440 --> 41:02.171
Do you think they're okay
down in the office by themselves?

41:02.720 --> 41:05.860
Uh, I needed this. You have no idea.

41:05.960 --> 41:07.580
This day has been something else.

41:07.680 --> 41:09.660
Both the bridge and the tunnel
were closed this morning

41:09.760 --> 41:11.780
so traffic was a nightmare,

41:11.880 --> 41:14.611
and Tony was yellin' at me
like it was my fault or something.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.300
He's just mad because he's short.

41:17.400 --> 41:18.401
No offense.

41:19.160 --> 41:21.340
So, um... Greene Homes up in the Arctic?

41:21.440 --> 41:25.020
Crazy, huh? I'll take you to see
an exact mock-up of one.

41:25.120 --> 41:27.140
It's actually a few floors
down from our offices.

41:27.240 --> 41:29.971
You'll see, they practically
sell themselves.

41:31.080 --> 41:32.286
If that's even a good thing.

41:32.760 --> 41:33.740
What's... what's that?

41:33.840 --> 41:37.180
Nothing, nothing. Just, after having
been up in the Arctic myself

41:37.280 --> 41:39.300
and seeing how beautiful it is,

41:39.400 --> 41:41.767
I wonder if it's even good
to have houses up there.

41:42.760 --> 41:44.660
That sounds silly, doesn't it?

41:44.760 --> 41:47.604
Not at all. I know exactly what you mean.

41:49.200 --> 41:51.521
Oh, I gotta take this. It's my daughter.

41:52.200 --> 41:54.441
Hi, Olympia. How did the tour go?

41:55.000 --> 41:56.620
Are you loving the new school?

41:56.720 --> 41:59.660
Well' it was just a tour,
but I'm happy you love it.

41:59.760 --> 42:01.489
I'll talk to Mr. Greene again and...

42:01.960 --> 42:03.803
No. Okay, honey. I have to go.

42:04.240 --> 42:06.004
See you tonight. Love you.

42:07.080 --> 42:09.620
- A lot goin' on?
- Yeah, sorry about that.

42:09.720 --> 42:13.580
Olympia is, well, brilliant,
but it's... complicated.

42:13.680 --> 42:15.100
Good schools are important.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.886
Yes. Really, really. Really important.

42:20.960 --> 42:22.140
Mmm.

42:22.240 --> 42:26.643
Oh, thanks, Chef Kozawa.
That certainly looks fresh.

42:33.920 --> 42:35.365
You wanna play rough?

42:36.040 --> 42:36.962
Okay.

42:38.320 --> 42:41.460
Don't worry, patrons,
it's just a tranquilizer gun.

42:41.560 --> 42:43.801
It's only sometimes lethal on humans.

42:46.640 --> 42:49.220
I don't know who sent you,
but the party's over, pal.

42:49.320 --> 42:51.580
Mr. Greene, what are you doing?

42:51.680 --> 42:53.648
You smell like a wild animal, Norm.

42:54.560 --> 42:56.780
Mr. Greene, just because I haven't bathed,

42:56.880 --> 42:58.060
you're gonna shoot me?

42:58.160 --> 42:59.940
Jeez, I heard New Yorkers
could be hostile,

43:00.040 --> 43:01.860
but this is a little much.

43:01.960 --> 43:04.042
I'm warning you!

43:21.040 --> 43:25.780
Ah, is there a sharp pain
in everyone's bottom?

43:25.880 --> 43:28.540
Or is it just me?

43:28.640 --> 43:31.371
Ohh, I'm feeling it.

43:35.120 --> 43:38.420
Norm-san, you are my guest anytime.

43:38.520 --> 43:40.887
- Arigato.
- Do itashi, bro.

43:44.120 --> 43:45.610
Norm of the North, everyone.

43:51.640 --> 43:53.961
Where am I? What happened?

43:56.120 --> 43:57.540
Somebody shoot that bear!

43:57.640 --> 43:59.220
Mr. Greene, please, relax.

43:59.320 --> 44:01.368
I think you might want to see this.

44:01.520 --> 44:02.740
And in other news...

44:02.840 --> 44:06.300
The local news caught your outburst
at Kozawa's today

44:06.400 --> 44:08.220
and Norm's heroism.

44:08.320 --> 44:10.220
Everyone's talking about Norm,

44:10.320 --> 44:13.688
and look at our approval ratings.

44:14.760 --> 44:18.560
Oh, my goodness.
We are rising faster than the oceans.

44:20.320 --> 44:22.766
Norm, uh, buddy. I...

44:24.640 --> 44:27.260
I thought he was a real bear.
I mean, I was confused

44:27.360 --> 44:29.886
because he smells
just like that other polar...

44:31.960 --> 44:32.940
vortex.

44:33.040 --> 44:37.125
That storm brought all the smells
of winter right to our doorsteps.

44:38.080 --> 44:39.605
"Real bear," huh?

44:40.360 --> 44:42.220
You know what?
Just forget the whole thing.

44:42.320 --> 44:44.900
Some guy from a cola company
approached me at Kozawa's.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.940
Said they needed a bear
for a holiday thing.

44:47.040 --> 44:49.805
Because of me,
your ratings just jumped 20%.

44:50.440 --> 44:52.380
Imagine what I could do
for a real company.

44:52.480 --> 44:53.481
Norm, wait.

44:54.480 --> 44:58.020
If you let him walk out that door,
we are back to square one.

44:58.120 --> 45:02.091
Norm, Norm, Norm.
Um, I am so sorry I shot at you.

45:02.280 --> 45:03.327
Hug?

45:04.800 --> 45:05.722
Awkward.

45:07.200 --> 45:10.900
Well, Normie has to look
for a new job and a place to live.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.260
Not all of us can afford
a fancy Greene condo,

45:13.360 --> 45:16.060
which I hear is fully furnished
and uninhabited,

45:16.160 --> 45:20.449
and I will probably
sleep in the park alone.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.411
Norm, wait.

45:24.440 --> 45:28.140
Vera, he can stay... in the model home.

45:28.240 --> 45:31.130
Ah! I am brilliant!

45:46.280 --> 45:48.260
Hmm. Perfect.

45:48.360 --> 45:51.260
So close to work, no commute and so homey.

45:51.360 --> 45:53.060
Right, lemmings?

45:53.160 --> 45:54.980
Hey, hey-hey-hey, careful.

45:55.080 --> 45:56.320
Those are the finest
leather hides from Italy.

45:59.600 --> 46:02.020
- Are they housetrained?
- Oh, definitely.

46:02.120 --> 46:03.963
They've peed in tons of houses.

46:11.720 --> 46:13.340
Well, I guess we'll settle in.

46:13.440 --> 46:16.020
Okay, we'll work on getting you
out on the campaign trail

46:16.120 --> 46:17.420
for Greene Homes.

46:17.520 --> 46:21.180
Get some rest, and there's a minibar
with some food in it.

46:21.280 --> 46:23.620
I'll give you a 3% discount.

46:23.720 --> 46:25.540
Vera, you work on
settin' up the marketing.

46:25.640 --> 46:27.085
I'll take care of the rest.

46:31.720 --> 46:33.660
Okay, boys, we gotta find Grandpa,

46:33.760 --> 46:35.140
stop these condos from gettin' built

46:35.240 --> 46:36.260
and get home.

46:36.360 --> 46:38.340
And on top of all that,
Mr. Greene's watching us,

46:38.440 --> 46:39.521
so act natural.

46:41.680 --> 46:43.205
Not that natural.

46:43.880 --> 46:45.020
Okay...

46:45.120 --> 46:46.406
Okay, look.

46:52.240 --> 46:54.260
Okay, look, we need someone
to provide cover

46:54.360 --> 46:57.300
while I go investigate that shelf
that smelled like Grandpa.

46:57.400 --> 46:59.402
I think I know just the guy.

47:02.800 --> 47:06.100
Look, all you have to do is go up there
and pretend to be me.

47:06.200 --> 47:07.900
The lemmings will let you in.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.140
There's plenty of salmon
in the minibar, so help yourself.

47:11.240 --> 47:13.700
Brilliant. Thank you, kind bear.

47:13.800 --> 47:16.849
We'll leave the lights on for you.

47:18.120 --> 47:20.168
Okay, it's just like an iceberg...

47:20.880 --> 47:24.282
an iceberg with hundreds of witnesses
to watch me climb.

47:31.360 --> 47:32.521
Mm-hmm!

47:35.240 --> 47:36.651
Whoo-hoo!

47:51.360 --> 47:54.100
I just got it. That's our Norm, huh?

47:54.200 --> 47:56.771
I'll start booking talk shows
first thing in the morning.

48:31.240 --> 48:33.860
I have Councilwoman Klubeck
ready for the call.

48:33.960 --> 48:36.420
Janet, you're the best at being the worst.

48:36.520 --> 48:38.020
Knock next time.

48:38.120 --> 48:39.610
Whatever.

48:45.040 --> 48:48.140
You just woke me up,
so this better be good.

48:48.240 --> 48:50.260
Sorry to wake you, but I found an actor

48:50.360 --> 48:52.220
who plays a polar bear perfectly.

48:52.320 --> 48:53.580
He even smells like a bear.

48:53.680 --> 48:56.340
The public will fall for him for sure.

48:56.440 --> 48:58.580
Smart. They'll love him,

48:58.680 --> 49:01.580
especially all those extra tourists
we let in the Arctic.

49:01.680 --> 49:03.364
Just for you, Greene.

49:04.200 --> 49:06.820
On that note, the floor plans
for your condo in the Bahamas

49:06.920 --> 49:08.081
are already on the way.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.460
It's so gigantic it's bigger than my ego.

49:11.560 --> 49:12.980
And we got those deluxe showerheads...

49:13.080 --> 49:15.140
oh, it'll wash that guilt right off.

49:15.240 --> 49:17.020
I don't have any guilt.

49:17.120 --> 49:20.860
You want 10 miles of ice,
we still have five million more.

49:20.960 --> 49:22.540
Just get the people behind this.

49:22.640 --> 49:24.722
I need that to push this through.

49:25.600 --> 49:28.490
Well done, Greene. As usual.

50:16.720 --> 50:18.085
That smells like my grandpa.

50:22.920 --> 50:23.940
Okay, think.

50:24.040 --> 50:26.140
If you were a slightly creepy,
one-note villain,

50:26.240 --> 50:27.844
where would you keep stuff hidden?

50:41.000 --> 50:43.980
Right. This guy's got
security cameras everywhere.

50:44.080 --> 50:45.180
I'll be too obvious.

50:45.280 --> 50:47.100
You guys go check it out first.

50:47.200 --> 50:51.091
If Grandpa's actually in there,
tell him Norm has come to the rescue.

50:57.600 --> 50:59.409
If you guys had bones,
I'd be worried about you.

51:02.040 --> 51:03.804
...can't you see I'm busy?

51:19.440 --> 51:21.363
Lemmings! Is Norm with you?

51:49.880 --> 51:51.340
So he was down there?

51:51.440 --> 51:53.568
Well, we need to get him out right now.

51:55.480 --> 51:57.847
Grandpa says it'll blow my cover
if I break him out?

51:59.080 --> 52:00.420
He wants me to build an ark?

52:00.520 --> 52:02.180
Oh, no, no.

52:02.280 --> 52:05.340
He wants me to focus on the Arctic,
saving the Arctic.

52:05.440 --> 52:07.100
I got it. It all makes sense.

52:07.200 --> 52:10.140
I'll save the Arctic first,
and then I'll save Grandpa.

52:10.240 --> 52:12.891
And then, if I have time,
I'll build an ark.

52:21.720 --> 52:23.245
Makeup!

52:29.640 --> 52:32.660
Hey, Norm. Norm,
this is my daughter, Olympia.

52:32.760 --> 52:35.331
Olympia, this is the great actor
I was telling you about.

52:38.520 --> 52:39.820
Great to meet you, Norm.

52:39.920 --> 52:42.127
Quite a costume you found yourself.

52:42.520 --> 52:45.660
Yes, hi, Mr. Greene.
Sorry I didn't pick up before.

52:45.760 --> 52:48.660
Your mom is very good at her job, Olympia.

52:48.760 --> 52:50.020
You must be proud.

52:50.120 --> 52:51.100
I know.

52:51.200 --> 52:53.340
Sometimes I wish she wasn't
so good at her job,

52:53.440 --> 52:56.340
if it meant she got to spend
more time with me.

52:56.440 --> 52:58.500
- Oh! You have lemmings.
- Mm-hmm.

52:58.600 --> 53:00.500
The smallest animals in the Arctic.

53:00.600 --> 53:01.931
Can I?

53:06.560 --> 53:09.484
They're very instinctive.
They know a good person.

53:15.680 --> 53:17.420
Hmm, so let's see.

53:17.520 --> 53:21.140
You're approximately 500 kilograms,

53:21.240 --> 53:23.100
exact skull and nose proportions.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.900
I don't know what you're talking about.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.860
I only weigh 194 pounds,

53:26.960 --> 53:28.620
just like the average American male.

53:28.720 --> 53:31.326
Please, I know exactly
what you're doing, Norm.

53:32.680 --> 53:35.540
You're saving the Arctic, your home.

53:35.640 --> 53:37.900
So I'm thinking,
maybe we can work together.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.420
And you can save my home in the process.

53:40.520 --> 53:42.380
...like you and me. I tell ya!

53:42.480 --> 53:43.641
There's nothing to...

53:43.920 --> 53:46.940
Be honest. What's your plan here?

53:47.040 --> 53:50.420
Well, Mr. Greene wants
to use me to sell the Arctic,

53:50.520 --> 53:52.300
and I'm gonna use the Arctic to save it.

53:52.400 --> 53:54.940
Exactly. You have to rally the public

53:55.040 --> 53:56.860
so that they love you,
wait for your moment

53:56.960 --> 53:58.860
and turn them against Greene.

53:58.960 --> 54:01.220
Use his own plan to defeat him.

54:01.320 --> 54:05.100
But the key is to make sure
you time your moment just right,

54:05.200 --> 54:07.248
when the public loves you the most.

54:07.920 --> 54:09.140
The approval rating!

54:09.240 --> 54:11.860
I'll get it as high as possible,
and then I'll strike.

54:11.960 --> 54:14.180
Olympia, you really are a genius.

54:14.280 --> 54:16.806
My mom's not the only one
who studied marketing.

54:20.280 --> 54:22.140
So ladies and gentlemen,

54:22.240 --> 54:23.820
we have an unusual guest today

54:23.920 --> 54:26.820
who is here to tell us about
his home, the Arctic,

54:26.920 --> 54:29.460
and how you can make it your home, too.

54:29.560 --> 54:33.963
Without further ado, Norm of the North!

54:45.760 --> 54:50.766
Whoo! So, Norm, you're here
for a very special mission.

54:51.120 --> 54:52.780
Would you like to tell us what it is?

54:52.880 --> 54:56.300
Uh, um... I... I, uh...

54:56.400 --> 55:00.060
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think our furry friend's a little nervous.

55:00.160 --> 55:01.900
Well, let's loosen him up

55:02.000 --> 55:05.607
with a clip of some
of his most recent heroics.

55:07.680 --> 55:09.967
I'm warning you.

55:20.040 --> 55:21.900
You know, if we're not helping each other,

55:22.000 --> 55:23.940
I mean, what are we here for, you know?

55:24.040 --> 55:25.620
Aww...

55:25.720 --> 55:28.020
"What are we here for?"
We're here to sell condos!

55:28.120 --> 55:29.963
Talk about Greene Homes!

55:30.400 --> 55:31.322
What a jerk.

55:31.720 --> 55:36.169
What can I say?
Norm, the public loves you.

55:38.080 --> 55:42.060
Hey, Tamecia. What do you say
we take this party to a bigger stage?

Look at Norm! He's famous!

56:57.040 --> 57:00.500
Norm's fame has helped our cause,
but it isn't enough, Greene.

57:00.600 --> 57:03.860
I can't get this through
until Norm publicly says,

57:03.960 --> 57:07.260
"Norm of the North supports
Greene Homes in the Arctic."

57:07.360 --> 57:09.567
Make sure he does it or you're done.

57:22.480 --> 57:24.380
This is it, Norm. You did it.

57:24.480 --> 57:27.260
The public loves you.
And you know what that means?

57:27.360 --> 57:30.125
You're right, Olympia.
It's time to save our homes.

57:57.080 --> 57:59.020
How long can it take
to get into a costume?

57:59.120 --> 58:00.690
I don't think he liked the outfit.

58:01.080 --> 58:02.605
Norm, can you please come out?

58:07.400 --> 58:08.481
I think I just did.

58:20.920 --> 58:23.321
Okay, lemmings. We got one shot at this.

58:23.800 --> 58:27.521
It's showtime. We do this,
and then we go get Grandpa.

59:01.800 --> 59:02.860
So someone somewhere

59:02.960 --> 59:05.260
thought it was a good idea
to build in the Arctic.

59:05.360 --> 59:08.728
That someone is our "friend," Mr. Greene.

59:09.680 --> 59:11.620
I just wanted to let you
all know the truth

59:11.720 --> 59:13.484
about what this would mean for my home.

59:17.120 --> 59:23.162
Norm of the North supports
Greene Homes in the Arctic.

59:32.800 --> 59:35.963
Norm! Norm! Norm! Norm! Norm!

59:46.280 --> 59:48.540
Ha ha! Norm, we did it.

59:48.640 --> 59:49.820
I'm on with my architect.

59:49.920 --> 59:52.764
We're figuring out where to put
the first Arctic frozen yogurt shop.

59:53.760 --> 59:57.420
Your announcement
has been reposted a million times!

59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.580
No, your announcement
was reposted a million times.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.420
I had something I needed to say.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.620
Four homes pre-sold, and already built.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.700
Mr. Greene, you can't sell the homes yet.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.300
We don't have approval
from the Council. It's illegal.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:15.724
Aw, I'm wittle Vee-wa.
I'm scared of po-weece.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.580
Guess what, toots. I'm above the law.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.765
Welcome to the cold, hard world
of "big bidness."

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:25.850
You sound just like the investors.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.540
"Uh, duh, it has to be done
correctly, Greene,

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.085
with integrity."

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.900
Please. Wake up and smell the profits.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.620
Not to mention that after
Norm of the North's announcement today,

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.768
approval is a guarantee.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.441
Norm, come back! Don't be a diva.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.060
Vera, get my lawyer.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.730
We're gonna copyright that roar
and make it a ringtone.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.940
Hey, it's Norm of the North!

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.087
You're the king!

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:14.460
I'm Norm of the North, king of nothing.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:15.800
I came to save my home.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.125
I ended up destroying it.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:23.260
Norm, your grandpa once told me,

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.300
"Norm's the only bear
that has the potential to be...

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.402
King of the Arctic."

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.860
Hey, Norm. Norm!

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.420
Why don't you come over for dinner?

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.860
I'd rather be alone right now, Vera.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.540
Please, just leave me be.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.620
Norm, why are you so down? You were great!

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.260
The campaign was a success.

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:03.940
Everyone loves you.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:04.940
Don't you get it, Vera?

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.820
Because of me,
Mr. Greene is gonna destroy my home.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:12.260
I think you're taking this polar bear act
a little too far, Norm.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.011
Come on. Olympia would love it
if you came over.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.243
Olympia...?
Dinner with a genius? Mm, I'm in.

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.700
You wouldn't happen to know where
I can get some ice water, huh?

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.406
You know, so I can freshen up
a little bit? For dinner.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.202
Ooh. You okay?

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.286
Ah!

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.601
It's humble, but it's home.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:00.004
You should see my place. No furniture,
but I do get year-round air conditioning.

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.966
Whoo-hoo!

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.326
Thanks, Mrs. Soo.

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.900
Mommy, you're home early.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.380
How was school today?

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.740
Scintillating, as usual.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.620
Olympia's just not really
challenged at her current school.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.451
That's why Magister Mundi
will be so great.

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.805
All the students are like Olympia.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:27.820
I actually think Olympia
and myself are a lot alike.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.620
We're both special. We have great gifts.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:31.687
Two peas in a pod.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:33.722
Besties.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.620
Anyway, Mommy,
I was researching the effects

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.180
of human activity in the Arctic,

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.420
and the research is irrefutable.

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:45.682
It will destroy the Arctic and possibly
the rest of the Earth as we know it.

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:49.849
Olympia, Greene Homes will bring
awareness to the Arctic.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.727
Olympia, let's you and I go hang out
on that comfortable-looking sofa.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:14.540
Vera, it's official. Just got word.

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.926
The Polar Council is a yes!

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:18.340
Oh, okay.

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.647
Make the announcement tomorrow.
Time to go public.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.580
We're in. We got approval.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.620
Well, don't all scream at once.

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.820
It's not over yet, Norm.
You can still do something.

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:34.260
Shake it up.
Hit Mr. Greene where it hurts,

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.521
his wallet.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.920
Where do you think
the investors are right now?

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.442
Ha ha. Great job, everyone. Great job.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.011
It was amazing.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:04:59.362
Oh, thanks, guys!

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.340
I've got to get Pablo and the investors
to uninvest in Greene.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:05.680
- Norm!
- Norm!

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.682
Aah!

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.367
Whoa!

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.860
Hi, guys. I'm sorry for just
dropping in on you like this, but...

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.620
- Whoa! You're a real bear?
- Uh-huh.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.260
Who can speak?

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.740
Yeah, who would have thought?

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:48.700
But I need to come clean
about who I really am

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:50.260
and what I'm really doing here.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.660
We know exactly who you are.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.460
You're Norm of the North.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:58.740
I am Pablo, and this is
my investment group. Ha ha.

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:02.020
Pablo, building in the Arctic
will destroy my home.

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:03.340
That's where I live.

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.300
But the Polar Council, well...

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.180
they are very aware of the impact.

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.850
You mean this council?

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.460
On that note, the floor plans
for your condo in the Bahamas

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.820
are already on the way.

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.500
And we got those deluxe showerheads,

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.206
oh, it'll wash that guilt right off.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.140
How did you get this?

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.460
I had some very small hairy associates

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.210
relieve Mr. Greene of his flash drive.

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.300
You're corrupt!

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.900
You took our money under false pretense,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.129
and you're as fake
as that ponytail clip-on.

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:44.100
It doesn't matter if I'm corrupt,
because a deal's a deal.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.780
The first four homes are built,

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.580
and once they land in the Arctic,

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.206
you're contractually obligated
to fund the rest.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.900
If I know Greene,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.980
he'll have the homes transported tonight.

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.260
Yeah, and if I know Mr. Greene,
he'll dispose of anything

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:01.725
that reminds him of the Arctic.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:07.300
You promise to take care
of Vera and Olympia?

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.180
I never got a chance to say goodbye.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.620
Norm, you have my word.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.370
Now get me out of this deal.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.100
We need to get the homes
down to the river.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.167
That old bear? No!

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.920
We need to get rid of him
before he can cause any trouble.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:29.923
Commence "Operation Kill That Bear."

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.487
Just as Pablo predicted.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.811
And just like I predicted.

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.083
I bet Grandpa is in that last one.

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:53.965
Whoa!

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.845
Ow!

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.247
Grandpa!

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:18.642
Where'd he go?

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:30.243
- Norm!
- Grandpa!

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.979
Everyone back home
thought you abandoned us,

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.924
but Socrates and I always knew
that something happened.

01:08:36.439 --> 01:08:37.979
Oh, it's good to see you.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.819
You know, sometimes
when you stick up to The Man,

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.819
you get stuck with a tranquilizer dart.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.140
Were you able to stop Greene?

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.060
Not yet.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.060
The houses are being transported tonight.

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:50.050
If we can stop them, maybe we can
stop this whole operation.

01:08:50.439 --> 01:08:52.249
Then what the heck are you doing here?

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.420
Norm, don't worry about me.
It's your time now.

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:02.220
Leave me. Go!
Save the Arctic! Save our homes.

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:05.005
You are the Arctic, Grandpa.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.844
Hmm. I must have weakened them for you.

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:12.965
What do you say we go save our home?

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:34.687
What?

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.366
The Arctic rats?

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:46.527
What?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.779
What do you mean the bear
broke out of the cage?

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:52.020
It's impossible. He's like, 80.

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.804
It would have taken two bears to...

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:58.980
What? That isn't Norm!

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.162
Get the chopper and find two polar bears!

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.321
How long until the ship leaves?

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.180
I don't care
if they're predicting a storm.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.691
Leave now!

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.250
The houses are on the way to the Arctic!

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.086
We gotta get to them!

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.500
Where are we headed?

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:37.931
Same place where I came in.

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:52.967
There they are!

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:57.647
Get ready, Grandpa. There's our ride home.

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.820
If we don't get down there,

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.729
it's gonna be a long swim to the Arctic.

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:55.851
Ohh. Hey!

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.980
Just shoot those bears.

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:10.740
Greene said to put them out of their
misery and dump 'em in the ocean.

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:12.740
Wait! Wait!

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.205
You guys think we're bears?

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:15.940
You hear that, Grandpa?

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:20.980
Talking polar bears in Manhattan?
Now, come on, guys.

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.481
Yeah, maybe our friend
the Easter Bunny's around here, too.

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:25.900
Are you sure they're bears?

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.980
They sound like humans to me.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.651
I didn't sign up to shoot real people.

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:07.340
Norm, no matter what happens,

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.660
just know that I'm proud of you.

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.020
You've come a long way.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.930
You might think you're not a hunter,
but you are.

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:18.540
Your way of hunting is just
different than everyone else.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:22.060
You're going to make a great king one day.

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.161
I know it.

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.340
What's wrong?

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:27.780
We're gonna get this, Norm.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.660
No, sorry. It's not about that.

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.047
I... I'm just worried.
In saving our own home,

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.365
I may have ruined someone else's.

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.642
I'm just hoping
Vera and Olympia will be okay.

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.650
It's beautiful, Mom,

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:07.700
but what will it look like
when you and Mr. Greene

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:09.131
build all those houses there?

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.460
"Mr. Greene, I'm sorry,

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.500
but I cannot help you destroy
somebody's home

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.443
in order to build houses no one needs.

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:22.968
I quit."

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:36.660
Okay, every office around the world
is ready to feed this.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:37.740
Are you sure, Pablo?

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.366
Yes. Send it now.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:53.340
We have to dislodge this barge
so we can flip these houses.

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:56.091
These condos must never reach the Arctic.

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:03.047
Buckle up, guys. This could get bumpy.

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:10.728
We have to do this, now.

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.860
It won't dislodge, it's too rough.

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.450
The swells keep pushing it back.

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.368
Welcome to the real North Shore!

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:05.729
See you on the other side,
whichever one we get to.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.300
But remember, whatever happens,

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:11.927
a king always fights for his home!

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:16.206
Come on, lemmings! Aah!

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:05.122
A king always fights for his home.

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:23.882
Lemmings! Grandpa!

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.540
Talk to me.

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:40.260
What the... they never got there?

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.566
Then where are my condos?

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:44.700
The bottom of the ocean?

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.006
Is that some kinda joke?

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:48.885
Two polar bears?

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:57.260
"Greene Homes and Polar Council
under investigations

01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:58.850
for bribery charges"?

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:02.407
"Beloved Norm helps reveal sham"?

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:06.770
These condos weren't
for any of you peasants anyway.

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:10.730
They were for the one percent.
The one percent!

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:20.964
Huh, would you look at that?
I'm late for yoga.

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.685
Namaste, everybody.

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.690
- Janet?
- Whatever.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:26.442
Janet! Aah!

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.420
Help me, you peasants! Help me!

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:31.648
Don't you know who I am? Huh?

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:35.860
Rats! They're crawling on me!
This is Italian!

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.530
Aah!

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.248
Look who's out of hibernation.

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:48.482
Son.

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:54.882
Every time I see you,
you've fallen on your butt.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.540
I march to the beat of my own drum.
You know that.

01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.290
When everyone else stands, I sit.

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.180
- Ta-da!
- Lemmings!

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.122
You made it!

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:03.961
Where's Grandpa?

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:05.482
Did he...?

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:08.323
We've searched everywhere, Norm.

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.771
No.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.220
Norm, you saved our home.

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.420
I'm sorry I didn't realize until now,

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.443
but we are so proud of you.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:34.340
The lemmings told us what you've done.

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:36.980
You used your gift
and you risked your life

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.650
to protect ours.

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:42.820
And on behalf of all of us...

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:44.251
thank you.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.283
Remember what we discussed?

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.408
A new day dawns upon us.

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:59.060
We need a leader who feels for the Arctic,

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:02.562
speaks for the Arctic,
and always fights for our home.

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:06.060
Norm, I crown you...

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.162
Now just a New York minute.

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.700
You can't do this without me.

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:12.722
Grandpa!

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.900
They all said you drowned.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.650
I was 80% sure you were gonna make it.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:29.660
Now that's what I call a grand entrance.

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.860
The tide took me all the way to Greenland,

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.580
but I hitched a ride with an orca.

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:37.480
He said he was coming back
to audition for Stan.

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:40.880
You need therapy.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:44.084
I have an opening tomorrow afternoon.
Book yourself in.

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.249
Son, please continue.

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.530
Norm, I crown you king.

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.966
That's my brother! Yeah!

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:22.580
If the clouds clear
and the barometric pressure

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.660
is just right...

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:27.340
Wow. I see Magister Mundi is teaching you

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.886
all these fancy new terms already.

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:33.289
I told you I could do it on my own,
without Greene.

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:36.167
Aren't you liking it
without Mr. Greene in your life, too?

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.642
Pablo seems like a much better boss.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.767
Well, Norm gave me a great recommendation.

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.722
Oh, my gosh! I can see it!

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.484
I can finally see it.

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:51.245
He even looks like Norm.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:53.361
I miss him, Mom.

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:56.127
Me, too. But I know he made it home.

01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:58.324
I bet he has his own family now.

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:22.242
Isn't it pretty?

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:29.049
Yeah. I wonder if Vera and Olympia
can see this, too.

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.009
