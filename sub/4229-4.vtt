WEBVTT

00:02.852 --> 00:05.121
That's it.

00:05.155 --> 00:07.624
That's the rendezvous
I worked out with Cochise.

00:07.691 --> 00:09.158
Not a moment too soon.

00:09.193 --> 00:11.327
People need rest, food,
time to care for the wounded.

00:11.362 --> 00:13.363
They're gonna get it.

00:19.870 --> 00:21.337
No! Beamers!

00:21.405 --> 00:23.773
Take cover!

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:35.719 --> 00:38.054
Clear!

00:39.423 --> 00:41.758
That's their third patrol
since sunrise.

00:41.792 --> 00:44.961
We must have made the top of
the Espheni most wanted list.

00:44.995 --> 00:46.663
Yeah, well,
they can't be too happy

00:46.697 --> 00:48.331
we escaped
from their little prison.

00:48.365 --> 00:51.034
Burned an overlord
to a crisp.

00:51.068 --> 00:52.335
All in a day's work.

00:55.839 --> 00:58.141
Something wrong?
Nah.

00:58.175 --> 00:59.842
When those Beamers
went over,

00:59.877 --> 01:02.378
I thought I saw something
back the way we came from.

01:02.413 --> 01:05.281
I...
Okay.

01:06.450 --> 01:07.817
You all right?

01:07.851 --> 01:08.851
Got your back.

01:18.896 --> 01:20.246
What's the matter?

What's wrong?

01:32.509 --> 01:33.843
Dad!

01:38.248 --> 01:41.184
Somebody here's
got a bead on us.

01:43.187 --> 01:44.921
Cochise is expecting us!

01:46.790 --> 01:48.257
Tom Mason.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.469
Whoo.
You have made it.

02:01.839 --> 02:04.774
Tom, Hal,
Colonel Weaver,

02:04.842 --> 02:09.245
this is my second-in-command,
Shak-Chic il Sha Shesash.

02:10.247 --> 02:13.116
You're a tall one there,
Shaq.

02:13.150 --> 02:14.751
Shak-Chic.

02:14.785 --> 02:16.853
Isn't that what I said?

02:18.122 --> 02:21.791
I am glad to see you
free again, my friend.

02:21.859 --> 02:23.159
And the rest
of your people?

02:23.193 --> 02:24.827
A few of them
split off from us.

02:24.862 --> 02:26.996
But at last count,
we had 71 people with us.

02:27.030 --> 02:28.998
I am sorry we do not
have more to offer.

02:29.032 --> 02:30.466
This is a temporary --

02:30.501 --> 02:32.268
We're grateful for whatever
you're able to provide.

02:32.302 --> 02:34.771
I do have
some good news.

02:34.838 --> 02:36.973
I have located
your son Matt.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.776
You saw him?
Yes.

02:39.810 --> 02:42.378
In an Espheni camp
to the north.

02:42.412 --> 02:46.949
Unlike the one you escaped from,
it is populated by children.

02:46.984 --> 02:50.419
But come inside.
I will show you where.

02:50.454 --> 02:52.789
Thank you, my friend.

03:15.145 --> 03:16.813
I thought
you might be hungry.

03:24.087 --> 03:26.189
I wouldn't be down here

03:26.223 --> 03:28.064
if I didn't believe
in your potential, Matthew.

03:28.091 --> 03:29.892
What do you want,
Kent?

03:29.927 --> 03:32.208
Just the names of the others
involved in your escape plan.

03:33.163 --> 03:35.331
Just explain it to me.

03:35.365 --> 03:37.066
How could you side
with them?

03:37.100 --> 03:38.167
You're a human being.

03:38.202 --> 03:39.902
This isn't kickball,
Matthew.

03:39.937 --> 03:42.004
There are no sides,
only the truth.

03:42.039 --> 03:43.239
The Espheni
are our friends.

03:43.273 --> 03:45.074
They tried to destroy
the world.

03:45.108 --> 03:47.243
They defended themselves,
as anyone would when attacked.

03:47.277 --> 03:50.079
They attacked <i>us!</i>
I was there! I saw it!

03:50.147 --> 03:53.049
You're a child.
You don't know what you saw.

03:53.083 --> 03:54.417
Only a few years ago,

03:54.451 --> 03:56.586
the world was a mess --
global warming,

03:56.620 --> 03:59.021
financial corruption,
terrorism everywhere.

03:59.089 --> 04:01.891
The Espheni offered us a chance
to start over,

04:01.925 --> 04:03.359
but our leaders
didn't trust them.

04:03.393 --> 04:05.027
They attacked
without provocation.

04:05.062 --> 04:06.429
You can't really
believe that.

04:06.463 --> 04:07.930
It's not about
what I believe!

04:07.965 --> 04:09.465
It's about the truth.

04:09.533 --> 04:13.035
This is a new beginning,
and you can join us.

04:13.070 --> 04:15.071
Just give me
those names.

04:15.105 --> 04:16.539
There was no one else.

04:16.572 --> 04:18.541
This isn't a shakedown,
Matthew.

04:18.575 --> 04:21.344
Soon it will never occur
to you to sow dissent.

04:21.411 --> 04:24.046
It just takes time
to distinguish

04:24.081 --> 04:25.414
between the real world

04:25.449 --> 04:29.285
and the fantasy
of a child's world.

04:47.437 --> 04:50.373
We have been using
airborne recon drones --

04:50.407 --> 04:52.541
a fraction of the size
of your common housefly.

04:52.576 --> 04:54.977
They provide us an aerial view
of our current position.

04:55.045 --> 04:57.280
That's how you found Matt's
location -- using those drones?

04:57.314 --> 05:00.383
Correct.
Almost inadvertently, in fact.

05:00.417 --> 05:02.585
It is
a day's trek on foot.

05:02.619 --> 05:04.086
We'll leave A.S.A.P.

05:04.121 --> 05:06.055
I'm coming with you.

05:06.089 --> 05:08.057
Listen,
this is personal.

05:08.091 --> 05:10.226
Someone needs to hold down
the fort while we're gone.

05:10.260 --> 05:13.930
You need me...

05:13.964 --> 05:15.197
'Cause I'm the one
who knows

05:15.232 --> 05:16.666
what you're going through
as a father.

05:16.700 --> 05:18.668
Ever since those monsters
took Jeanne,

05:18.702 --> 05:20.269
I've been the same.

05:20.304 --> 05:21.604
And you know that if I knew
where she was,

05:21.638 --> 05:23.572
there's <i>nothing</i>
that could stop me

05:23.607 --> 05:25.942
from going after her.

05:25.976 --> 05:27.610
You know, a parent's instinct
is to protect.

05:27.644 --> 05:29.278
It will make you do stupid,
reckless things.

05:29.313 --> 05:31.147
Are we talking about me,
or are we talking about you?

05:31.214 --> 05:33.316
I'm talking,
so you listen.

05:33.350 --> 05:36.152
You're biting off
more than you can chew.

05:36.186 --> 05:38.988
I'm gonna make sure
you don't choke on it.

05:41.358 --> 05:43.693
All right, then.

05:43.727 --> 05:45.695
It's your show till we get back.
All right.

05:45.729 --> 05:47.363
You'll need to
scavenge food, water,

05:47.397 --> 05:49.031
weapons
if you can find them.

05:49.066 --> 05:51.334
2nd Mass needs to get back
to fighting strength.

05:51.368 --> 05:52.969
That's a tall order.

05:53.003 --> 05:54.170
I wouldn't be
giving it to you

05:54.204 --> 05:55.604
if I didn't know
you could handle it.

05:55.639 --> 05:57.606
You're ready.

05:57.641 --> 05:59.608
Those bastards aren't gonna quit
until they find us.

05:59.643 --> 06:01.610
Stay undercover.
Do not move from this position.

06:01.645 --> 06:03.679
Cochise.

06:03.747 --> 06:06.549
Perimeter patrols
around the clock,

06:06.583 --> 06:08.050
four-hour shifts.

06:08.085 --> 06:11.087
We'll be back
in 48 hours...

06:11.121 --> 06:12.621
Come hell or high water.

06:12.656 --> 06:14.390
Give them hell.

07:01.271 --> 07:03.606
What's going on?

07:03.640 --> 07:05.674
I thought I heard something --
some kind of animal.

07:05.742 --> 07:07.610
Cougar or bobcat
wouldn't be unheard of

07:07.644 --> 07:09.145
in this part
of the country.

07:15.719 --> 07:20.056
Colonel Weaver is displaying
somewhat...erratic behavior.

07:20.090 --> 07:23.092
I know.

07:23.126 --> 07:25.361
Don't worry.
He'll come through.

07:25.395 --> 07:27.229
Can't really blame him.

07:27.297 --> 07:30.499
The Espheni patrols have been
all over us since our escape.

07:36.807 --> 07:39.275
Dan. We got to move.

07:39.309 --> 07:41.677
Come on.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.583
I'll take point.

08:03.289 --> 08:05.757
Everything we grow here
has a purpose.

08:05.792 --> 08:08.894
This is
a natural antibiotic.

08:08.928 --> 08:11.696
Peace be with you.
Peace be with you.

08:11.764 --> 08:13.698
These people --
they worship you.

08:13.766 --> 08:17.269
They're just grateful
to have found a place of peace.

08:17.303 --> 08:18.603
It won't last.

08:18.638 --> 08:20.338
I don't know why the Espheni
haven't found it.

08:20.373 --> 08:22.474
But they'll destroy it
once they do.

08:22.542 --> 08:24.443
We don't pose a threat
to them.

08:24.477 --> 08:25.811
We follow
a nonviolent path.

08:25.845 --> 08:28.480
Tell that to the Tibetans.

08:28.514 --> 08:29.881
They were a whole nation
of pacifists.

08:29.916 --> 08:32.583
Don't patronize me,
Mom.

08:32.618 --> 08:34.852
I'm --
I'm sorry, Lexi.

08:34.886 --> 08:38.690
I'm just a little spun
by all this.

08:38.724 --> 08:42.727
Six months ago,
you were just a little girl.

08:42.761 --> 08:44.729
I...didn't mean
to upset you.

08:44.764 --> 08:46.731
No, no, of course not.

08:46.766 --> 08:47.933
You missed a chance
at a normal life,

08:47.967 --> 08:49.468
and I let them take that
from you.

08:49.502 --> 08:50.969
You can't
blame yourself.

08:51.037 --> 08:52.871
Of course I can.
I'm your mother.

08:52.905 --> 08:56.274
You did your best.
I know you did.

08:56.342 --> 08:58.977
A path has been set
for me.

08:59.011 --> 09:01.847
I just need the strength
to walk it.

09:01.881 --> 09:03.348
You can't go in there!

09:03.382 --> 09:04.483
Look, I'm going.

09:04.517 --> 09:05.984
- Anthony!
- What's the problem?

09:06.052 --> 09:08.854
She said we got to give up
our guns or leave?

09:08.888 --> 09:11.590
What the hell is the matter
with you, Lourdes? It's me.

09:11.624 --> 09:13.925
We don't allow
weapons here.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.627
Yeah, okay,
you tell that to the Espheni

09:15.661 --> 09:17.028
when they come knocking.
All right, Anthony.

09:17.063 --> 09:20.532
Take the men
past the perimeter.

09:20.566 --> 09:21.846
Set up camp.
I'll check in later.

09:30.443 --> 09:33.912
Thank you...
for understanding.

09:40.653 --> 09:42.653
Dingaan got the foundry's
backup generator started,

09:42.655 --> 09:43.922
so at least
we got light and heat.

09:43.956 --> 09:46.825
Yeah, for now.
Thing's running on fumes.

09:46.859 --> 09:48.827
So add fuel
to the laundry list.

09:48.861 --> 09:50.462
Boy,
that's a long list.

09:50.496 --> 09:53.632
We need to re-up medical
supplies. We need fresh water.

09:53.666 --> 09:56.034
Even on half rations, that food
that Cochise salvaged --

09:56.068 --> 09:57.802
it ain't gonna last long.
Mm-hmm.

09:57.837 --> 10:00.338
We may need to strike out
and resupply.

10:00.373 --> 10:02.340
As long as it's close.

10:02.375 --> 10:03.875
Nobody moves
from this position.

10:03.910 --> 10:05.544
All right,
whatever you say.

10:05.611 --> 10:07.812
Here's some of the people
you wanted to talk to.

10:07.847 --> 10:09.114
Hey.
How's it going, guys?

10:09.148 --> 10:10.448
Thanks for taking the time
to help us out here.

10:10.483 --> 10:11.783
Since you all lived here

10:11.851 --> 10:13.952
before the, uh,
ghetto walls came down,

10:14.020 --> 10:15.854
I'm hoping you can help us
find the best place

10:15.888 --> 10:17.455
to scrounge
for some supplies --

10:17.523 --> 10:20.492
food, water, fuel,
uh, medicine --

10:20.526 --> 10:22.894
any of that stuff.
It's at the top of the list.

10:22.929 --> 10:24.763
Most of the filling stations
around here have been bled dry.

10:24.830 --> 10:27.465
Well, I did bookkeeping
for an organic farm

10:27.500 --> 10:29.467
out on 321
near Winnsboro.

10:29.502 --> 10:32.003
Had their own supply of diesel.
Winnsboro?

10:32.038 --> 10:33.471
I got that old pickup
out back running.

10:33.506 --> 10:34.940
Make it out there
on a quarter tank.

10:34.974 --> 10:37.842
Yeah, uh, Winnsboro's
right on the perimeter.

10:37.877 --> 10:41.746
That's risky.

10:41.814 --> 10:44.015
You know what? Um, I'm gonna
wait till my dad gets back.

10:44.050 --> 10:45.550
Then we'll check it out.

10:45.585 --> 10:47.919
<i>If</i> your dad gets back.

10:47.954 --> 10:50.088
Come on, Hal. What are these
people supposed to do?

10:50.122 --> 10:51.923
Huh? Sit around singing
campfire ditties?

10:51.958 --> 10:54.659
I could take the truck.
I can handle a gas run.

10:54.694 --> 10:57.429
No one moves
from this position.

10:57.463 --> 10:59.965
Not until we get orders
to change it.

10:59.999 --> 11:02.367
Not until you get permission
to be in charge.

11:02.401 --> 11:03.602
Blah, blah, blah.
Jesus.

11:03.636 --> 11:06.071
I got to take a leak,
all right?

11:06.138 --> 11:07.539
You guys can all play
your little game

11:07.607 --> 11:08.740
of "daddy, may I?"
Till I get back.

11:08.774 --> 11:10.609
All right,
does anybody know

11:10.643 --> 11:12.110
where we can find
some fresh water?

11:12.178 --> 11:14.045
There's a quarry on the other
side of the foundry.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.580
Water used
to be drinkable.

11:17.950 --> 11:19.651
Hey!

11:21.053 --> 11:24.456
Hey! Get back here!

11:33.466 --> 11:36.568
There's no sign of Matt.

11:36.602 --> 11:39.471
There were children
here, many of them, in uniform,

11:39.505 --> 11:41.873
marching across the yard
in formation.

11:41.907 --> 11:43.642
Sounds like a page out of
the Hitler youth playbook.

11:43.676 --> 11:45.010
They should know better.

11:45.077 --> 11:47.145
The Hitler playbook didn't
exactly win the big game,

11:47.179 --> 11:48.980
as I remember.

11:49.015 --> 11:51.016
I'm sure you'll find a way to
remind them of that, Colonel.

11:51.083 --> 11:53.885
That's our
point of entry.

11:53.919 --> 11:55.587
As soon as it gets dark,
we go in.

11:55.655 --> 11:57.922
You are tired.

11:57.957 --> 12:00.091
You are observant.

12:00.126 --> 12:01.593
We cannot afford errors
due to exhaustion.

12:01.627 --> 12:03.461
We're not gonna rest,
Cochise,

12:03.529 --> 12:05.664
not while
Matt's down there.

12:08.768 --> 12:10.535
Cochise.

12:17.143 --> 12:19.144
Cochise.

12:19.178 --> 12:20.812
You all right?
It's gone!

12:20.880 --> 12:22.547
Some --
some kind of venom.

12:22.581 --> 12:24.783
I can feel it.

12:24.817 --> 12:26.918
What the hell was that?

12:26.952 --> 12:29.220
I don't know.

12:29.288 --> 12:33.024
I don't know any animal
that bleeds this stuff.

12:33.059 --> 12:35.560
Hang on, old friend.
Hang on.

12:35.594 --> 12:38.863
Do not worry, Tom Mason.

12:38.898 --> 12:40.498
Given time to rest...

12:40.533 --> 12:43.835
I will enter
a regenerative state.

12:43.869 --> 12:46.905
In several hours...
I will heal.

12:58.651 --> 13:00.218
I guess
he'll be all right.

13:00.252 --> 13:01.753
Let's hope so.

13:04.156 --> 13:06.958
What's going on with you?
Talk to me.

13:06.992 --> 13:09.561
I think I've seen this thing
that attacked him before.

13:09.595 --> 13:11.196
I feel like I saw it
back at the ghetto

13:11.230 --> 13:12.497
when we first got out.

13:12.531 --> 13:14.866
Why didn't
you say anything?

13:14.900 --> 13:17.602
Because I didn't know
if I'd seen it or not.

13:17.636 --> 13:19.804
We're tired. I thought I might
be hallucinating or something.

13:22.775 --> 13:26.077
Listen, Tom, the --
the Overlord that you torched --

13:26.145 --> 13:28.947
what exactly did he tell you
about skitterizing --

13:28.981 --> 13:31.116
you, us, humans?

13:31.150 --> 13:33.918
They said they perfected a way
to rob us of our free will

13:33.953 --> 13:36.087
so that we wouldn't fight back
like the skitters did.

13:36.122 --> 13:38.089
"Evolve or die,"
he said.

13:38.124 --> 13:41.226
Well, we'll put that to an end
when we get back.

13:41.260 --> 13:43.762
Right now we're thinking
about Matt.

13:43.796 --> 13:47.732
We're here to get Matt!
And I need your help!

13:47.767 --> 13:49.000
Can I count on you?

13:51.637 --> 13:53.938
I got your back.

14:00.060 --> 14:01.892
I was hoping
we might find others

14:01.893 --> 14:03.994
who had stayed free
of the prison camps.

14:04.692 --> 14:07.794
So, I was searching
the U.T.E. --

14:07.828 --> 14:11.598
the Government Utility Band --
and I heard this.

14:15.069 --> 14:17.403
<i> 35.226.</i>

14:17.438 --> 14:19.539
<i>A place of peace.</i>

14:19.607 --> 14:21.007
<i>All will be welcome.</i>

14:21.075 --> 14:22.375
The message is on a loop.
<i>Put down your arms...</i>

14:22.409 --> 14:24.010
It repeats
every 30 seconds.

14:24.044 --> 14:25.712
<i>35.226.</i>

14:25.746 --> 14:27.480
What are those, coordinates?
Yeah.

14:27.515 --> 14:30.984
This place of safety is
a day's march to the west.

14:31.018 --> 14:33.720
<i>A place of peace.</i>
<i>All will be welcomed.</i>

14:33.754 --> 14:35.755
I know that voice.

14:35.789 --> 14:37.590
<i>Put down your arms, and you may enter.</i>
That's Lourdes.

14:37.625 --> 14:40.527
Is she a friend? Someone you trust?
<i>35.226.</i>

14:41.762 --> 14:43.429
She was,
and then she wasn't.

14:43.464 --> 14:45.798
Hey, top gun,
you got a second?

14:45.833 --> 14:46.901
Yeah, what's up?

14:46.925 --> 14:47.500
Hey, man.
Hey.

14:47.501 --> 14:49.469
It's the Volm, man.
They're packing up to leave.

14:49.503 --> 14:51.471
You know that big ugly one
with the sourpuss?

14:51.505 --> 14:52.939
Uh, Shaq?

14:52.973 --> 14:54.507
Yeah, that's the one.

14:54.542 --> 14:56.643
He says they got new data
from their recon drones.

14:56.710 --> 14:58.044
Apparently, the Espheni
are doubling down

14:58.078 --> 14:59.679
on their search for us.

14:59.713 --> 15:01.514
He says he's certain
that they're gonna be here

15:01.549 --> 15:03.383
within 24 hours,
and him and his buddies --

15:03.417 --> 15:06.452
they ain't planning on
sticking around for the party.

15:06.487 --> 15:07.754
Maybe we should consider --
No!

15:07.788 --> 15:10.490
My dad and Cochise
are meeting us here.

15:10.524 --> 15:12.492
Or not.

15:12.526 --> 15:16.462
Don't shoot the messenger, man.
I know.

15:16.497 --> 15:18.932
Whatever we decide to do,
according to the Volm,

15:18.999 --> 15:21.100
staying here
ain't an option.

15:56.937 --> 16:00.440
Whoa!

16:00.507 --> 16:02.008
Looky there!
We done struck oil!

16:09.016 --> 16:11.784
Oh! Easy!

16:11.852 --> 16:14.454
Lady, that's my ride.
What are you doing?

16:14.488 --> 16:16.656
I'm sorry, you know.
It's just like pistachios.

16:16.690 --> 16:18.851
You have one, and then you want
another one right away.

16:18.859 --> 16:20.660
Right, well, you're entitled
to your opinion.

16:20.694 --> 16:22.895
Listen, I -- we just wanted to
take some of your fuel there.

16:22.930 --> 16:24.497
That's --
Who's "We"?

16:24.531 --> 16:27.467
"We" is -- is me
and some friends of mine.

16:27.501 --> 16:29.669
Would these be
imaginary friends?

16:29.737 --> 16:32.538
Listen, uh, miss,

16:32.573 --> 16:34.007
I'll tell you what.

16:34.041 --> 16:36.009
I'll make a deal with you,
all right?

16:36.043 --> 16:38.778
You let me f-fill her up,
and then I'll fill you in.

16:38.812 --> 16:44.083
So you're saying a trade --
my gas for, uh...

16:44.118 --> 16:46.019
Pringles.

16:46.053 --> 16:47.553
I beg your pardon?

16:47.588 --> 16:49.055
No?

16:49.123 --> 16:51.591
Oh, come on, man. I've been
eating out of cans for months.

16:53.961 --> 16:55.628
I want to take
some of your fuel.

16:55.696 --> 16:59.565
You do not want to take
one step closer to my gas.

17:01.735 --> 17:03.836
You're not
gonna shoot me.

17:06.573 --> 17:09.108
Okay.
Pretty ballsy.

17:09.143 --> 17:13.179
Why don't we talk this out all
civilized-like over a beer?

17:15.316 --> 17:17.282
You have beer?

17:17.318 --> 17:20.787
Yeah. It's warm.
Is that a deal breaker?

17:22.256 --> 17:24.589
Uh, listen,
uh, appreciate it.

17:24.625 --> 17:25.925
Thank you very much --

17:25.959 --> 17:28.795
Yeah, you know,
it's not actually a request.

17:30.297 --> 17:33.032
A little piece
of heaven.

17:34.835 --> 17:36.135
Cheers.

17:36.170 --> 17:37.637
Cheers.

17:37.671 --> 17:40.306
Yeah. So...

17:40.341 --> 17:43.976
What are your friends
interested in my diesel for?

17:47.114 --> 17:50.616
Ohh!

17:50.651 --> 17:51.718
Thank you.

17:51.752 --> 17:53.686
We're, uh...

17:53.721 --> 17:55.188
We're holed up nearby.

17:55.222 --> 17:57.023
Genny's running low,
so...

17:57.057 --> 17:59.559
Nice of you
to stick your neck out.

17:59.593 --> 18:02.295
So, you said this is, uh --
this is your place, yeah?

18:02.329 --> 18:04.530
Um, more like
squatter's rights.

18:04.565 --> 18:07.900
Mm, you didn't strike me as the,
uh, farming type.

18:07.935 --> 18:10.236
No, I'm a graphic designer --
I was --

18:10.304 --> 18:13.873
for a company that designs
water-resistant cellphone cases.

18:13.941 --> 18:15.708
Not much need
for that anymore.

18:15.776 --> 18:16.976
No, thank God.

18:17.044 --> 18:18.978
I mean, I used to hate
going to work.

18:19.046 --> 18:21.981
I hated coming home.
I hated everything in between.

18:22.015 --> 18:23.549
Honestly, the apocalypse

18:23.617 --> 18:25.318
is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

18:27.721 --> 18:30.656
I know the feeling.

18:30.691 --> 18:32.325
Ever since
the aliens came,

18:32.393 --> 18:34.627
I'm living each day
as if it were my last.

18:34.661 --> 18:37.096
I do what I want
when I want to.

18:37.164 --> 18:39.799
I take what I want
when I want it,

18:39.833 --> 18:41.067
like that truck
of yours.

18:41.101 --> 18:44.303
My truck?
You like my truck?

18:44.338 --> 18:45.872
Oh, she's a beauty.
Oh, yeah.

18:45.939 --> 18:47.640
Yeah, that's why
I'm taking her...

18:47.674 --> 18:48.674
and the gas.

18:48.709 --> 18:49.876
I'm sorry.

18:51.645 --> 18:54.080
Listen, sweetie,
you're fun, but...

18:54.148 --> 18:55.848
I got to...

18:55.883 --> 18:57.884
Ooh! Yeah.

18:57.918 --> 18:58.985
See, uh,
the guy who lived here

18:59.019 --> 19:01.888
must have had
a hell of a bad back

19:01.922 --> 19:05.358
because this cabinet's
just chock-full of pills.

19:05.392 --> 19:07.794
Of course, none of it
was my prescription.

19:10.164 --> 19:12.365
Sweet dreams.

19:17.738 --> 19:20.339
Must be hard.

19:20.374 --> 19:22.909
It was a shock
the first time I saw her.

19:25.946 --> 19:27.780
I knew Lexi...

19:27.815 --> 19:31.751
might still be aging
at some strange rate.

19:33.153 --> 19:36.622
I had this picture
in my head

19:36.657 --> 19:40.660
of the little girl
I lost.

19:40.694 --> 19:43.362
Now I don't know
what she is.

19:45.999 --> 19:48.334
Anne, there's something
we have to tell you.

19:48.368 --> 19:50.002
Ben convinced me
to wait.

19:50.037 --> 19:51.971
I thought she might even
tell you herself.

19:52.005 --> 19:53.306
Tell me what?

19:53.373 --> 19:55.875
Lexi has been meeting
with an Espheni.

19:55.943 --> 19:57.243
Ben followed her
and saw them together.

19:57.277 --> 19:58.377
When we confronted her
about it,

19:58.412 --> 20:00.012
she said she'd brokered
a truce --

20:00.047 --> 20:01.314
that that's how this place
stayed off the radar.

20:01.348 --> 20:03.115
I could feel it!

20:03.150 --> 20:06.285
Do they all know --
Lourdes and the rest of them?

20:06.353 --> 20:07.854
They all think
she's some kind of messiah

20:07.888 --> 20:09.088
who can do no wrong.

20:09.122 --> 20:11.290
Son of a bitch!

20:11.325 --> 20:12.859
I'm gonna find that piece of --
That's what I'm saying.

20:12.926 --> 20:15.027
It's about time we kicked
a little ass around here.

20:15.062 --> 20:17.029
I say we hunt it down
and blow its brains out.

20:17.064 --> 20:18.738
Fine, let's do this.
Let's not fly off the handle here.

20:18.739 --> 20:19.491
You said it yourself, Anne.

20:19.515 --> 20:21.434
Ben!
We don't know what Lexi is.

20:21.435 --> 20:23.035
We don't know
how she got this way.

20:23.070 --> 20:24.337
This -- this could be
a real opportunity

20:24.371 --> 20:27.840
to understand what Karen
did to her and why.

20:27.875 --> 20:30.376
Fine.

20:30.410 --> 20:32.445
But we do this my way.

20:42.356 --> 20:44.423
Dang it!

20:44.458 --> 20:46.959
I knew I should have used those
big old yellow pills instead.

20:46.994 --> 20:48.694
Look, I'm sorry,
but you showed up

20:48.762 --> 20:50.463
just when my supplies
were running low.

20:50.497 --> 20:52.131
Okay, I loaded
your truck with diesel,

20:52.165 --> 20:53.900
and I will be out of your hair
in a minute.

20:53.934 --> 20:57.770
Look, lady, take the truck,
all right?

20:57.804 --> 21:00.172
But don't --
don't do me like this.

21:00.207 --> 21:02.527
I got the feeling that there may
be a whole legion of women

21:02.543 --> 21:05.878
out there who want to do you
exactly like this.

21:07.281 --> 21:08.814
Ohh, this is great.

21:08.882 --> 21:10.049
Shh! Quiet!

21:10.083 --> 21:12.151
We can't hide.
They'll spot the truck.

21:12.185 --> 21:14.287
Lady,
you listen to me.

21:14.354 --> 21:15.888
Listen to me
and you listen good.

21:15.923 --> 21:17.223
Now, that thing out there --
you ever taken one down?

21:17.291 --> 21:20.092
I have.
That's what I do.

21:20.127 --> 21:22.862
Now, it may not look like it,
but right now

21:22.896 --> 21:24.830
I am the only shot you got
to survive.

21:24.865 --> 21:26.365
Only you got
to make a decision.

21:26.433 --> 21:28.134
You've got
to make it right now.

21:36.944 --> 21:39.078
I'm Sara, by the way.

22:03.182 --> 22:05.350
I got you.

22:17.964 --> 22:19.364
Hey.

22:19.398 --> 22:20.866
We're gonna get you
all out of here.

22:20.900 --> 22:24.269
I'm looking
for my son -- Matt.

22:31.644 --> 22:34.779
Tom!

22:34.847 --> 22:36.181
We got to
get out of here!

22:36.215 --> 22:37.315
No.
Come on! Come on!

22:37.350 --> 22:39.251
Not without Matt!

22:39.285 --> 22:43.288
We got to move!
Stay close to me.

22:43.322 --> 22:47.592
More than one mech.
Quick. Come on.

22:47.660 --> 22:49.594
"Mechs"? That's not
a very original nickname.

22:49.662 --> 22:52.964
If we survive this, you can
come up with a better one.

22:52.999 --> 22:54.966
Where are my keys?

22:55.001 --> 22:57.769
I'm driving.

23:07.613 --> 23:08.747
What is that?

23:08.781 --> 23:10.315
Matt!
Come on!

23:12.718 --> 23:14.786
You're looking for Matt?
I'm his father.

23:14.820 --> 23:17.656
I can show you.

23:20.293 --> 23:23.328
This way.
He's in here.

23:29.335 --> 23:30.535
What is it?

23:30.603 --> 23:32.871
I'll hold this position,
cover your back.

23:32.905 --> 23:34.472
Damn it, Tom!
Get your boy!

23:54.660 --> 23:56.328
There are intruders
calling your name.

23:56.395 --> 23:58.330
Did you have something to do
with this, Matthew?

23:58.397 --> 23:59.764
My name is Matt.
That's right.

23:59.799 --> 24:01.599
You want to be called
your childhood name

24:01.667 --> 24:03.335
because you
want to remain a child.

24:03.369 --> 24:05.370
And all we wanted to do
was to make you a man --

24:05.404 --> 24:07.372
to cleanse your mind of years
of brainwashing!

24:07.406 --> 24:09.374
You're the brainwashed one,
you psychopath!

24:11.544 --> 24:15.046
I had high hopes
for you, Matt!

24:21.787 --> 24:23.822
You lay a hand
on my son?!

24:24.623 --> 24:25.857
Dad!

24:27.326 --> 24:28.960
Dad!

24:28.995 --> 24:30.295
Dad!

24:38.070 --> 24:41.573
I got you.
I'm here.

24:41.607 --> 24:44.509
I'm here.

24:57.523 --> 24:58.957
Come on, Matt.
Let's go home.

24:58.991 --> 25:00.625
Come on!

25:02.094 --> 25:06.064
Staring up at it won't stop
the day from coming.

25:07.767 --> 25:10.068
I know.

25:10.102 --> 25:13.938
It's this thing
in my family.

25:13.973 --> 25:16.641
My mom started it.

25:16.675 --> 25:18.343
I was about 9 years old.

25:18.377 --> 25:21.646
I was heading off
to this summer sports camp.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.848
My first time
away from home,

25:23.883 --> 25:26.351
and she said
if the moon was up

25:26.385 --> 25:27.819
that I wasn't alone.

25:27.853 --> 25:30.388
'Cause chances were
somebody else in the family

25:30.423 --> 25:32.023
was staring
at that same moon.

25:32.058 --> 25:34.426
Hmm. You're worried
about your father.

25:34.460 --> 25:36.061
Nah.

25:36.095 --> 25:39.130
He said he was gonna
bring Matt back. He will.

25:41.033 --> 25:43.835
The question is,
will we still be here?

25:45.604 --> 25:47.539
What that Volm
told Tector

25:47.573 --> 25:50.742
was an assumption
based on his device, hmm?

25:50.810 --> 25:52.677
Our patrols have seen
no Espheni.

25:52.711 --> 25:55.580
But if the Volm
are right...

25:55.614 --> 25:58.550
I mean, dad told me to stay here
for a reason, you know,

25:58.584 --> 26:01.086
but it's just as dangerous
to hole up here

26:01.120 --> 26:03.888
as it is to be on the move out there.
Hal.

26:03.956 --> 26:05.657
Sometimes the infantryman

26:05.691 --> 26:08.159
has to make the hard call
of a general.

26:08.194 --> 26:10.128
Huh?

26:10.196 --> 26:13.164
When we were escaping
from Charleston,

26:13.199 --> 26:16.835
I made the wrong call...

26:16.869 --> 26:19.571
And a man died.

26:22.074 --> 26:25.043
Henry.

26:25.077 --> 26:27.679
He fought
in World War II.

26:30.916 --> 26:36.387
This...camp that you went to
when you were a child --

26:36.422 --> 26:38.756
what sport was it?
It was lacrosse.

26:38.791 --> 26:41.893
Ah.
Lacrosse?

26:41.927 --> 26:44.062
Ah, lacrosse
is not a sport, man.

26:44.096 --> 26:46.431
Huh?
Rugby is a sport.

26:46.465 --> 26:48.633
Are you ready to throw down right now?

26:48.667 --> 26:51.136
We had sticks fighting
each other for a ball.

26:51.170 --> 26:53.972
That's aggressive by American standards.
Mm-hmm.

26:54.039 --> 26:57.175
I'm happy to say I don't know
much about lacrosse,

26:57.209 --> 27:00.879
but on my rugby team,
we had a saying --

27:00.913 --> 27:05.450
don't think about the game
you lost last week, hmm?

27:05.484 --> 27:08.987
Just win the game
you're in.

27:23.135 --> 27:24.569
Where's your friend?

27:24.603 --> 27:26.504
Yeah, shouldn't we wait
for the colonel?

27:26.539 --> 27:28.840
The plan was to meet back
at the campsite

27:28.874 --> 27:29.974
if anything went wrong.

27:30.009 --> 27:31.042
Don't worry.

27:31.076 --> 27:32.744
Dan Weaver's
been getting himself

27:32.811 --> 27:34.479
out of hot water since before
you were in diapers.

27:34.513 --> 27:35.780
He'll be there.

27:35.814 --> 27:38.149
But we can't get
to this fence.

27:38.184 --> 27:39.684
We need to find
another way out.

27:43.789 --> 27:45.623
I can distract them.

27:45.658 --> 27:47.492
You can't.
I won't let you.

27:47.526 --> 27:49.093
They don't know that
we're in this together, Matt.

27:49.128 --> 27:50.828
They don't know that I don't
believe their lies.

27:50.896 --> 27:53.097
No, Mira.
You're coming with us.

27:53.132 --> 27:56.067
When I graduate,
I'll come find you.

27:56.101 --> 27:57.735
I owe you one.

27:57.770 --> 27:58.937
Mira, no. Wait, wait.

27:58.971 --> 28:00.471
Dad.

28:03.642 --> 28:05.777
We'll come back for her,
and the others.

28:05.811 --> 28:07.178
I promise.

28:10.916 --> 28:12.817
Come on, Matt.

28:47.286 --> 28:50.655
Oh, no.

28:59.632 --> 29:01.699
Daddy.

29:04.270 --> 29:05.570
Jeanne.

29:27.953 --> 29:31.356
Get off of her!
Get off.

29:44.403 --> 29:46.571
Hang on.

29:48.040 --> 29:51.342
It's you. Oh, Jeanne.

29:53.279 --> 29:56.414
Oh, Jeanne,
I knew it was you.

29:56.448 --> 29:58.116
Oh, Jeanne.

30:15.301 --> 30:18.303
So, this is
where we part ways.

30:18.337 --> 30:19.637
I don't think so.

30:19.672 --> 30:21.272
Like I told you before,

30:21.307 --> 30:22.907
we need the fuel back there
more than you do.

30:22.942 --> 30:25.243
Ah, come on.
I thought we'd established

30:25.277 --> 30:26.878
you weren't
the trigger-happy type.

30:26.912 --> 30:29.080
That was then. This is now.
Do not tempt me.

30:29.114 --> 30:30.481
I didn't plan on it.

30:30.549 --> 30:32.217
What?

30:32.251 --> 30:34.319
Yeah, you were a little busy
back there with those mechs.

30:34.386 --> 30:36.154
Weren't you? Now,
here's how it's gonna roll.

30:36.222 --> 30:39.357
See, I'm gonna retake my truck
and my fuel.

30:39.391 --> 30:41.526
You -- if you
want to try and stop me,

30:41.560 --> 30:44.128
knock yourself out, but we both
know I'm gonna end up with it.

30:44.163 --> 30:46.097
I know karate.

30:46.131 --> 30:47.131
No, you don't.

30:47.199 --> 30:48.199
Yes, I do.
Jeet Kune Do.

30:48.267 --> 30:49.567
Even if that was
a real thing

30:49.602 --> 30:51.269
and you did know it,
you'd have used it already.

30:51.303 --> 30:54.072
You're walking.
Get out of my truck.

30:54.139 --> 30:57.242
Man.

30:57.276 --> 31:00.211
I'll remember that.

31:00.246 --> 31:02.580
I'll, uh, toss the shells
a quarter mile down the road.

31:02.615 --> 31:04.082
How's that?

31:04.116 --> 31:05.583
So you're really gonna
leave me out here

31:05.651 --> 31:06.985
in the middle of the road

31:07.019 --> 31:09.354
to be raped and eaten
by cannibals?

31:09.388 --> 31:11.189
Not necessarily
in that order.

31:11.223 --> 31:12.890
Don't tempt me.
What do you think

31:12.958 --> 31:14.525
I've been doing
this whole time?

31:22.501 --> 31:25.303
Get in. Get in. Get in.

31:26.572 --> 31:28.373
I can't definitively tell you

31:28.407 --> 31:30.341
that this transmission
can be trusted.

31:30.376 --> 31:32.510
I can't promise we're not
jumping straight

31:32.544 --> 31:34.512
from the frying pan
straight into the fire.

31:34.546 --> 31:38.216
All I can tell you
is we can't stay here.

31:38.250 --> 31:40.084
And we won't stay here.

31:40.119 --> 31:43.187
So I need everybody up and out
by tomorrow before first light.

31:43.222 --> 31:46.057
All right, you heard the man!
Start packing up!

31:46.091 --> 31:48.259
We head out dark
and early!

31:52.164 --> 31:53.665
Where the hell
have <i>you</i> been?

31:53.732 --> 31:55.566
Hey, you can
take it down a notch

31:55.601 --> 31:58.236
because I just got you
the diesel that <i>you</i> needed.

31:58.304 --> 31:59.971
You just put us all at risk.
Ah!

32:00.005 --> 32:01.973
You disobeyed
a direct order

32:02.007 --> 32:05.076
and about got yourself
left behind!

32:05.110 --> 32:06.944
Come again?
An order?

32:06.979 --> 32:08.219
Hey.

32:08.247 --> 32:09.714
How about a thank-you?

32:09.748 --> 32:10.982
I'm sorry.

32:11.016 --> 32:12.250
Good start.
Keep going.

32:12.284 --> 32:13.484
And who are you?

32:13.519 --> 32:15.053
No, the question is
who are <i>you?</i>

32:15.120 --> 32:16.587
'Cause <i>we</i> just
risked <i>our</i> asses

32:16.622 --> 32:18.256
getting <i>you</i> a tank of gas.

32:18.290 --> 32:20.091
So, where's your badge,
sheriff?

32:20.125 --> 32:22.060
Someone around here
elect you mayor?

32:22.094 --> 32:24.128
'Cause I don't know
if you got the memo,

32:24.163 --> 32:27.165
but those jobs don't exist
anymore, right?

32:27.199 --> 32:30.001
You know what?
You're right.

32:30.035 --> 32:32.337
I'm not the boss.

32:32.371 --> 32:34.405
And you're right, too.
I don't give orders.

32:34.473 --> 32:36.007
I appreciate
what you did.

32:36.041 --> 32:38.009
I do not appreciate
the way you did it.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.511
Fair enough.

32:40.546 --> 32:43.348
For now, anyway.

32:45.317 --> 32:46.651
Where did you find her?

32:46.719 --> 32:49.387
On the farm, all right?
Crawling with mechs.

32:49.455 --> 32:51.155
How many of them?
A whole army.

32:51.190 --> 32:52.991
And they're headed this way.
We got to go <i>now.</i>

32:57.062 --> 32:59.197
Lexi.

32:59.231 --> 33:00.732
What are
you doing here?

33:00.799 --> 33:03.568
You had to know they would tell
me what they saw eventually.

33:03.602 --> 33:05.636
I just wanted to have
a little time

33:05.671 --> 33:08.573
where we could be together --
mother and daughter --

33:08.607 --> 33:12.143
before you...
became afraid of me.

33:12.177 --> 33:13.344
I'm not scared.

33:13.412 --> 33:16.381
I'm worried,
like any mother would be.

33:16.415 --> 33:19.450
I just -- I just
want to keep you safe.

33:19.485 --> 33:21.152
That's what I'm doing.

33:21.186 --> 33:23.721
That's why I'm meeting
with him --

33:23.756 --> 33:26.090
to keep us all safe.
It's not that simple,

33:26.125 --> 33:29.227
not where the Espheni
are concerned.

33:29.261 --> 33:31.763
He must want something
from you, Lexi,

33:31.797 --> 33:34.665
or none of this
would be happening.

33:34.700 --> 33:36.501
I need to speak to him.

33:36.535 --> 33:38.269
You'll kill him.

33:38.303 --> 33:39.570
No. I won't.

33:40.773 --> 33:43.608
Don't lie to me, mother.

33:43.642 --> 33:46.043
Ben.

33:46.078 --> 33:47.612
The Espheni is here.

33:47.646 --> 33:50.248
They're taking him over
through his spikes.

33:50.282 --> 33:53.684
Show yourself!

33:53.719 --> 33:55.386
By bringing you here,

33:55.454 --> 33:57.822
your daughter has put
our arrangement in jeopardy.

33:57.856 --> 33:59.791
We came here
on our own.

33:59.858 --> 34:02.660
Why have the Espheni
left this place untouched?

34:02.694 --> 34:04.429
There are some among us

34:04.463 --> 34:06.731
who believe that by bringing
our species together,

34:06.799 --> 34:09.766
we might be able to
live harmoniously.

34:09.802 --> 34:13.438
Then why hide yourself?
Meeting in secret?

34:13.472 --> 34:16.741
Unless you're keeping
something from her.

34:16.775 --> 34:20.511
I have nothing to hide.

34:21.880 --> 34:25.516
You must trust that I work
for a greater good, mother.

34:29.353 --> 34:31.389
Mother?

34:31.456 --> 34:35.293
Mother.
I know you.

34:35.327 --> 34:36.860
It was you.

34:36.895 --> 34:38.663
What is
she talking about?

34:38.697 --> 34:42.166
You're the one
who did this to me --

34:42.234 --> 34:43.734
to my daughter --

34:43.768 --> 34:46.337
experimented on her,
made her what she is!

34:46.371 --> 34:48.840
I was not the instigator.
You're a liar.

34:48.873 --> 34:50.741
But I'll get the truth.

34:50.775 --> 34:52.743
Anthony!
Restrain him!

34:52.777 --> 34:54.911
Wait!

34:54.947 --> 34:58.416
You said you only
wanted to talk to him.

34:58.450 --> 35:00.151
We made a pact.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.720
If you break it,
all we've built here goes away.

35:02.754 --> 35:04.155
It's a lie, Lexi!

35:04.223 --> 35:06.858
You're the liar!

35:06.925 --> 35:09.193
You say you remember me,
but you don't!

35:09.228 --> 35:11.162
You say
you're my mother!

35:11.196 --> 35:12.296
I am your mother!

35:12.331 --> 35:14.432
Ohh!

35:17.369 --> 35:19.937
Stop!
You must let them take me!

35:19.972 --> 35:21.772
Do not give in
to their base aggression.

35:36.989 --> 35:40.958
Anne's right! He's lying!
I can feel it in my head!

35:40.993 --> 35:42.460
Stay away
from my sister!

35:52.466 --> 35:54.534
Did they teach you graffiti
at lacrosse camp?

35:56.737 --> 35:58.905
It's a message for my dad.

35:58.939 --> 36:00.506
Something a history Professor
would understand,

36:00.541 --> 36:02.008
but the Espheni won't.

36:05.679 --> 36:07.647
Roanoke colonists carved this
into the wall of their fort

36:07.681 --> 36:10.416
when they had to abandon their
colony to head to safe haven.

36:14.655 --> 36:16.923
All right, everyone!

36:16.957 --> 36:18.458
Let's roll!

36:18.492 --> 36:22.862
You heard the man!
Double time! Let's go!

36:25.065 --> 36:29.035
Our recon drones register an
Espheni approach from the south.

36:29.069 --> 36:31.437
The route to the west
is clear.

36:31.472 --> 36:32.772
Excellent.

36:32.840 --> 36:34.907
We'll head towards
the coordinates we received.

36:34.942 --> 36:37.677
Glad you guys
decided to join us.

36:37.711 --> 36:41.647
It was a purely
strategic decision.

36:41.682 --> 36:43.649
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

37:11.845 --> 37:15.681
I am recovered enough
to travel.

37:15.716 --> 37:17.683
I'm glad you're feeling better,
my friend.

37:17.718 --> 37:19.852
We cannot afford to stay here
much longer.

37:19.887 --> 37:21.521
They'll search the area --
Colonel Weaver will be here.

37:27.027 --> 37:30.997
You had me worried there
for a minute, Colonel.

37:31.031 --> 37:32.999
Dan?

37:33.033 --> 37:34.500
Dan!

37:34.535 --> 37:36.969
She --
she's gone.

37:37.004 --> 37:39.472
Who's gone?
Dan, what happened back there?

37:39.540 --> 37:42.875
You were right.

37:42.910 --> 37:46.178
They're turning us into...
something.

37:46.213 --> 37:48.314
They're using us.

37:50.183 --> 37:53.486
That thing
that attacked us...

37:53.520 --> 37:57.690
that abomination...

37:57.724 --> 37:59.825
It was Jeanne.

37:59.860 --> 38:03.162
Oh, God, no.

38:05.265 --> 38:07.233
She's gone.

38:07.267 --> 38:10.636
I saw her go. She...

38:10.671 --> 38:12.939
It was...

38:16.710 --> 38:19.645
But she was in there,
Tom.

38:21.715 --> 38:23.883
She saved my life.

38:26.086 --> 38:31.223
This plan...to turn us
into monsters --

38:31.291 --> 38:34.260
it's flawed.

38:34.294 --> 38:38.698
They <i>can't</i> erase us.

38:38.765 --> 38:41.033
They cannot control us!

38:41.068 --> 38:42.969
My Jeanne
showed me that.

38:44.338 --> 38:47.006
She was a fighter
right to the end.

38:51.878 --> 38:56.015
Well, better this way.
Better that she's...

38:56.049 --> 39:00.019
Than have to live
like that.

39:00.053 --> 39:03.689
You know.

39:03.724 --> 39:05.725
Colonel Weaver?

39:08.996 --> 39:11.297
Ohh.

39:11.331 --> 39:13.666
Hey!

39:13.700 --> 39:15.901
Good to have you back,
soldier.

39:18.338 --> 39:21.641
Good to have you back.

39:57.277 --> 40:00.212
Geminus?

40:00.280 --> 40:03.249
Geminus, are you here?

40:03.283 --> 40:06.218
Trouble with your experiment?
Under control.

40:06.253 --> 40:08.888
Still haven't recovered
your prisoners?

40:08.922 --> 40:11.257
I am very close.
Thanks for your concern.

40:11.291 --> 40:13.926
When I find the one
called Mason,

40:13.994 --> 40:17.296
I will take pleasure
in burning him...slowly.

40:17.330 --> 40:18.998
Take pleasure from this --

40:19.032 --> 40:21.867
his daughter is more powerful
than we imagined.

40:21.902 --> 40:24.837
She will become a weapon
unlike any other,

40:24.871 --> 40:27.239
and she'll be ours.

40:27.274 --> 40:29.041
She obeys your will?

40:29.076 --> 40:31.210
In all things.

40:31.244 --> 40:33.746
Soon she will come
to full maturation,

40:33.780 --> 40:36.048
and the transformation
will begin.

40:36.116 --> 40:39.418
Our coalition bears fruit,
Geminus.

40:39.453 --> 40:42.054
If you do not fail,
that is.

40:42.089 --> 40:44.757
I stand corrected.

40:44.791 --> 40:47.293
Only you
would know failure.
