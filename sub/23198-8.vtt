01:44.484 --> 01:46.509
All hands, man your battle stations.

01:46.586 --> 01:49.214
Enemy sub sighted off the starboard stern.

02:31.364 --> 02:33.855
All hands secure from General Quarters.

02:42.075 --> 02:44.202
- Good morning, Yeoman Prince.
- General.

02:45.212 --> 02:47.442
- Morning, Steve.
- Morning, General.

02:47.514 --> 02:49.209
What do you make of this?

02:52.252 --> 02:54.846
One of our agents
transmitted it last night.

02:55.422 --> 02:59.324
"Wotan, possible landing within 24 hours.
Destination: Washington. "

02:59.759 --> 03:02.387
Wotan? The god of war
in German mythology?

03:03.630 --> 03:06.463
It's also the code name
for the Nazi's top agent.

03:06.533 --> 03:08.899
He's a dangerous man. Clever, too.

03:08.969 --> 03:12.063
Nobody knows what he looks like.
No photographs or descriptions.

03:12.138 --> 03:14.698
This just came off the wire.

03:15.375 --> 03:17.935
Enemy submarine
was just sunk in Chesapeake Bay.

03:18.011 --> 03:20.002
I wonder what it was doing in so close.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.014
You think there could be a connection...

03:22.082 --> 03:24.277
between that submarine
and the Wotan message?

03:24.351 --> 03:25.750
It sure looks that way.

03:25.819 --> 03:29.949
A submarine sunk in the shallow waters
of Chesapeake Bay with no survivors?

03:31.324 --> 03:34.157
Well, whatever it is,
we'll be waiting for him.

03:35.028 --> 03:36.689
- Let's go, Diana.
- General.

03:43.003 --> 03:46.871
The lookout on the southern headland
reports a rubber boat coming ashore.

03:46.940 --> 03:48.271
Three men.

03:48.475 --> 03:51.672
Then I was right.
The debris from the submarine.

03:52.112 --> 03:56.048
It's the sort of stuff they blow up
through a torpedo tube to fake a sinking.

03:56.116 --> 03:58.277
And if the U-boat
was going to land someone...

03:58.351 --> 04:01.115
this is the only practical
place in the area.

04:01.187 --> 04:04.554
I think that's a brilliant piece
of deductive reasoning.

04:04.624 --> 04:08.082
It's just a question of putting yourself
in the enemy's place.

04:16.970 --> 04:18.733
And there they are.

04:23.843 --> 04:28.007
Diana, report back to General Blankenship.
Tell him we've made contact.

04:28.248 --> 04:29.510
Yes, sir.

04:54.341 --> 04:56.206
Thank you, Yeoman Prince.

05:22.402 --> 05:24.734
Wotan! Look out!

05:37.951 --> 05:39.680
I've got a car waiting.

06:17.457 --> 06:18.856
He got away.

06:21.761 --> 06:24.252
- Steve, you're hurt.
- I'm all right.

06:24.330 --> 06:28.596
As soon as this eye stops throbbing.
That guy's got a punch like Joe Louis.

06:29.636 --> 06:31.695
They're not going anywhere.

06:38.211 --> 06:40.679
Get your picture taken, 50¢ each.

06:40.747 --> 06:45.343
Wouldn't you like a beautiful picture
to send to your mother? Just stand there.

06:45.618 --> 06:48.451
I wish I could've been at the beach.
I could've helped Steve.

06:48.521 --> 06:50.512
I wish I would've been able to help, too.

06:50.590 --> 06:52.854
If you'd been there,
you could've nursed his eye.

06:52.926 --> 06:54.393
- Etta.
- Oh, you would've loved it.

06:54.461 --> 06:57.089
- Where are we going?
- Just a little joint.

06:57.163 --> 06:58.391
- Joint?
- Place.

06:58.498 --> 07:01.399
- They serve the best sandwiches...
- How about a picture?

07:01.468 --> 07:05.234
It's a whack and a wave.
Get your picture taken, 50¢ each.

07:05.305 --> 07:07.102
Send it home to your boyfriend.

07:07.173 --> 07:10.233
- Come on, let's do it. It'll be fun.
- No.

07:10.310 --> 07:13.575
Okay, now. You just look
into the camera and say "cheese. "

07:15.115 --> 07:18.710
Beautiful. You fill out this mailer.
You'll have it in a week or 10 days.

07:18.785 --> 07:20.878
- I want three copies.
- You want three?

07:20.954 --> 07:23.514
You got a lot of boyfriends.
That's gonna be $1.50.

07:23.590 --> 07:27.219
- This a receipt?
- It certainly is. What does it look like?

07:32.832 --> 07:35.300
Thank you. You're gonna like that picture.

07:35.368 --> 07:37.131
- Okay, bye.
- So long.

07:40.306 --> 07:42.536
Now, wouldn't you like your picture taken?

07:42.609 --> 07:45.703
How about a beautiful picture
to send back home?

07:45.779 --> 07:47.110
No, thank you.

07:50.517 --> 07:53.145
- I've got the strangest feeling.
- What?

07:54.988 --> 07:57.183
I've seen that photographer before.

07:57.257 --> 07:59.885
Only feelings I have are hunger pains.

08:00.760 --> 08:02.751
Something about his eyes.

08:09.202 --> 08:11.170
See you tonight. Bye-bye.

08:56.182 --> 09:00.585
So you are all well versed in the ways
of the United States?

09:01.354 --> 09:03.754
All have completed their courses.

09:03.990 --> 09:06.891
Extensive training at our American village.

09:06.960 --> 09:11.397
Graduated at the top of their class,
competent in customs and language.

09:33.486 --> 09:34.680
Doctor.

09:41.194 --> 09:42.957
Yes, it can be done.

09:43.763 --> 09:46.857
Nose, hairline...

09:47.734 --> 09:49.395
and around the ears.

09:51.704 --> 09:55.970
Weight, jaw line. The scar is no problem.

09:56.843 --> 09:59.073
Some lift to the eye.

10:00.346 --> 10:03.213
- How long?
- Three weeks, perhaps four.

10:08.321 --> 10:10.050
- Two weeks.
- But, Wotan.

10:10.123 --> 10:14.025
I must be back in Washington by then,
and they must be with me.

10:32.378 --> 10:33.367
Flapper.

10:36.249 --> 10:37.443
Flatter than a pancake.

10:38.685 --> 10:39.674
Flimflam.

10:39.786 --> 10:42.414
And you're always telling me
to trust people.

10:42.522 --> 10:46.891
Etta, if only once you'd begin
at the beginning of a sentence.

10:47.226 --> 10:50.559
I gave that man $1.50
and he promised to send us our pictures.

10:50.697 --> 10:53.222
I ordered three
and he never even sent one.

10:53.299 --> 10:55.790
You know how us Gls
are always getting cheated.

10:56.069 --> 10:57.434
Might be an oversight.

10:57.503 --> 11:00.961
It's difficult for me to accept the premise
that that man was working...

11:01.741 --> 11:03.265
a flimflam on us.

11:03.876 --> 11:06.504
Flimflam? Yes, that's exactly what it was.

11:06.579 --> 11:08.513
He cheated me out of our pictures.

11:08.781 --> 11:13.081
One was for me and one was
for my mother and one was for you.

11:13.453 --> 11:15.648
That's very thoughtful of you, Etta.

11:16.222 --> 11:17.849
I think I'd like to do that.

11:18.391 --> 11:20.256
So my mother could see me in uniform.

11:20.660 --> 11:22.719
Good. Let's go right down
and get the pictures.

11:28.534 --> 11:30.297
Yes, ladies, what can I do for you?

11:30.370 --> 11:32.861
We had our pictures taken
by a street photographer.

11:33.473 --> 11:35.065
This is my mailer, all right.

11:35.141 --> 11:37.939
I gave him $1.50
but he never sent our pictures back.

11:38.011 --> 11:39.535
I don't know anything about that.

11:39.779 --> 11:43.545
I did some darkroom work for him and
let him use my shop for a mailing address.

11:43.816 --> 11:47.217
I haven't seen him for a couple of weeks.
I guess he's not coming back.

11:47.286 --> 11:49.151
Do you know where we can find him?

11:49.322 --> 11:52.348
I don't have any idea in the world
where he might be.

11:52.692 --> 11:55.490
Who knows, he might have got drafted.

11:55.728 --> 11:57.025
That's not funny.

11:57.230 --> 11:59.494
Besides, $1.50 doesn't grow on trees.

11:59.565 --> 12:03.023
And I promised a picture of me in uniform
for my mother on her birthday.

12:03.703 --> 12:07.969
This gentleman said that he can't help us.
We shouldn't waste any more of his time.

12:08.074 --> 12:09.666
You said a mouthful, lady.

12:09.809 --> 12:12.300
- But Diana...
- It's only a picture, Etta.

12:12.378 --> 12:14.312
We can always get another one taken.

12:14.480 --> 12:17.643
But, Diana, what about our money
and our pictures?

12:18.117 --> 12:21.518
You're just too nice.
That photographer was really a rook.

12:21.854 --> 12:23.651
I mean, talk about a flimflam.

12:23.723 --> 12:25.088
- Etta.
- What?

12:25.158 --> 12:28.753
I have some things I have to do in town.
I'll meet you back at headquarters.

12:28.828 --> 12:29.817
All right.

12:29.896 --> 12:32.194
I'm in such a rotten mood
it wouldn't matter anyway.

12:32.265 --> 12:34.290
I wouldn't be any fun to be with.

13:26.185 --> 13:27.675
Who are you?

13:28.121 --> 13:29.588
What are you doing here?

13:29.655 --> 13:32.453
Put that gun down.
I just wanna ask you some questions.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.101
Now you'll just have to
answer those questions, won't you?

14:19.238 --> 14:21.001
I'm glad you got here so fast.

14:21.174 --> 14:22.766
I came as soon as I got your message.

14:22.842 --> 14:25.538
Good thing Etta was back.
She knew where this place was.

14:25.611 --> 14:26.805
You bet I did.

14:27.313 --> 14:30.840
He and his friends still owe me $1.50.

14:31.384 --> 14:33.375
What's the emergency about?

14:33.486 --> 14:36.455
Yes. This man is in league with Wotan.

14:36.656 --> 14:37.645
How do you know?

14:37.723 --> 14:39.816
He was at the beach when Wotan landed.

14:39.959 --> 14:41.392
I also found this.

14:41.460 --> 14:42.449
I've questioned him...

14:42.528 --> 14:46.123
but he doesn't seem to know
where Wotan is or what his plans are.

14:48.834 --> 14:51.268
You haven't touched any of these dials,
have you?

14:51.504 --> 14:54.234
It's set on a frequency
we know the Nazis use.

14:55.274 --> 14:56.605
Whose place is this?

14:56.676 --> 14:59.907
It belongs to a street photographer.
He took a picture of Diana and me.

14:59.979 --> 15:02.277
- Where?
- Outside the Capitol Cafe.

15:02.348 --> 15:05.078
Across the street from
the Bureau of Printing and Engraving.

15:05.151 --> 15:08.780
That lovely building
where they make all the lovely money.

15:08.854 --> 15:11.687
You mean there's actually a place
where they make money?

15:13.826 --> 15:15.817
- Just make it?
- That's right.

15:16.028 --> 15:18.588
They do some top security printing
for us sometimes.

15:18.664 --> 15:20.859
I have to periodically check out
their security.

15:21.200 --> 15:24.363
I could do that tomorrow morning.
Show you around at the same time.

15:24.437 --> 15:26.632
Would you? I'd love that.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.731
- When?
- I'd have to get clearance.

15:30.176 --> 15:31.803
9:00? Would that be all right?

15:31.944 --> 15:34.435
9:00 would be fine. I'll be there.

15:35.748 --> 15:36.737
Bye-bye.

16:00.740 --> 16:01.729
Perfect.

16:05.011 --> 16:07.036
We're very proud of you, Doctor.

16:07.847 --> 16:11.078
And of you,
the new Hank Miller and Maggie Robbins.

16:11.717 --> 16:15.050
Remember, you're very much in love
and engaged to be married.

16:16.922 --> 16:18.321
Such a simple plan.

16:18.391 --> 16:21.588
Duplicate the people,
steal the engraving plates...

16:21.661 --> 16:25.188
flood the Allies with billions
of counterfeit dollars.

16:26.232 --> 16:28.462
Seriously cripple the American economy
as well.

16:28.534 --> 16:30.866
And all with the lowly $2 bill.

16:31.504 --> 16:33.904
You leave tonight.
Parachute into Canada...

16:33.973 --> 16:36.874
and be in Washington
before the week is out.

16:36.942 --> 16:38.136
And one thing more.

16:38.210 --> 16:41.407
I will personally be in complete control
of this project.

16:44.317 --> 16:45.477
What is wrong?

16:46.218 --> 16:49.915
Nothing, sir, just a toothache.
A filling is loose.

16:50.089 --> 16:52.319
Probably from the plastic surgery.

16:52.458 --> 16:55.621
Better have it fixed before it becomes
abscessed and causes trouble.

16:55.695 --> 16:57.390
Let us celebrate.

16:58.164 --> 17:00.462
Amazing work, Doctor.

17:00.833 --> 17:02.630
And you did it only in two weeks.

17:29.929 --> 17:33.092
I wondered how the Americans knew
I was going to land in Washington.

17:33.165 --> 17:36.157
In any event,
this will be your last transmission.

17:39.205 --> 17:40.866
They won't hear from you again.

17:49.148 --> 17:50.410
Yes, sir.

17:54.053 --> 17:56.078
- How's the eye?
- It's all right.

17:56.522 --> 17:59.218
It's almost patriotic. Red, black and blue.

18:00.226 --> 18:01.921
Here's some more bad luck.

18:02.228 --> 18:06.358
Cut off in the middle of transmission.
Maybe you'll understand it, I don't.

18:07.466 --> 18:10.663
"Wotan. $2 bill. " That's it? That's all?

18:11.036 --> 18:12.264
I'm afraid so.

18:12.338 --> 18:16.001
Our cryptographers are working on it.
They haven't come up with anything yet.

18:16.342 --> 18:19.778
Whatever it is, if it's a plan of Wotan's,
people are going to get hurt.

18:19.945 --> 18:23.711
We've got to find answers fast because
when he's ready to move, he's deadly.

19:34.119 --> 19:36.110
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

19:36.522 --> 19:40.891
Steve Trevor,
you have been up all night long.

19:42.661 --> 19:44.720
And I still can't figure out this $2 thing.

19:44.797 --> 19:46.560
Do you want some coffee?

19:46.732 --> 19:48.757
What I want are some answers.

19:50.202 --> 19:52.227
- $2 bill.
- Excuse me.

19:53.072 --> 19:56.337
- Lf old Tom Jefferson could only talk.
- Tom who?

19:56.509 --> 19:58.875
Come on, Diana. No time for kidding.

19:59.011 --> 20:03.175
Anybody who's ever handled money
knows whose picture is on the $2 bill.

20:03.782 --> 20:07.013
Money? Oh, boy. Is today Friday?

20:07.119 --> 20:08.518
Yes. Why? What's the matter?

20:08.587 --> 20:09.576
Wonder Woman.

20:09.655 --> 20:13.216
I've got to meet her at
the Bureau of Printing and Engraving.

20:28.941 --> 20:31.705
Well, Tom, say something.

20:40.953 --> 20:42.477
Of course.

20:43.355 --> 20:45.755
Thank you very much, Mr. Jefferson.

20:59.204 --> 21:01.798
Hi, I hope you haven't been waiting
too long.

21:01.907 --> 21:03.397
No, I just got here.

21:03.475 --> 21:05.841
Come on, let's go. Time for the grand tour.

21:05.945 --> 21:09.312
You're sure I'm not keeping you
from any important work?

21:09.381 --> 21:10.439
Positive.

21:10.516 --> 21:14.418
In fact, I'm stumped with a problem
that has to do with $2 bills.

21:14.486 --> 21:16.613
Maybe touring this place
will give me some ideas.

21:16.689 --> 21:18.213
Then let's go.

21:26.899 --> 21:28.332
Boy, are you a life saver.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.800
My counter man has just disappeared.

21:30.869 --> 21:34.737
Called his house, his car's there, but
no one knows what's happened to him.

21:34.873 --> 21:36.602
My lucky day.

21:38.143 --> 21:42.136
Capitol Cafe. Hi, honey. She is?

21:42.748 --> 21:46.275
I'll be over as soon as I can.
I'm just hiring a new man.

21:48.988 --> 21:50.615
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

21:53.659 --> 21:57.652
Boy, is she excited.
Great fan of yours, Wonder Woman.

21:58.097 --> 22:00.861
Now, shall we see how we make money?

22:01.233 --> 22:04.896
This is our main printing room
printing various denominations of bills.

22:05.170 --> 22:08.401
The result is valuable green paper,
which people refer to as money.

22:08.540 --> 22:10.770
If it's only green paper,
what makes it so valuable?

22:10.843 --> 22:15.405
There's gold to back it up
stored at a place called Fort Knox.

22:15.547 --> 22:18.175
The green paper is easier to carry around
than gold bars.

22:18.250 --> 22:20.912
Couldn't anyone print money?
It looks like plain paper.

22:20.986 --> 22:24.114
There's special paper, inks
and, of course, the engraving plates...

22:24.189 --> 22:26.248
which I personally keep
under lock and key.

22:26.325 --> 22:28.623
My fiancée, Maggie Robbins.

22:28.861 --> 22:31.193
Wonder Woman. Major Trevor.

22:31.997 --> 22:33.259
I'm so thrilled.

22:33.332 --> 22:36.392
I never would have forgiven Hank
if he hadn't called me.

22:36.468 --> 22:38.800
Hope you won't mind
autographing my menu.

22:38.871 --> 22:40.395
It was the first thing I could grab.

22:40.606 --> 22:44.042
It's for my brother in the Army.
It'll boost his morale.

22:44.109 --> 22:47.545
It's my pleasure. Anything we can do
for our men in uniform.

22:47.846 --> 22:48.938
Thank you.

22:49.014 --> 22:50.072
It's been a pleasure.

22:50.149 --> 22:51.912
Thanks for showing us around.

22:52.451 --> 22:55.147
- There you go.
- Thank you.

22:56.655 --> 22:59.215
And thank you. The tour was fascinating.

22:59.291 --> 23:00.883
You're welcome.

23:01.193 --> 23:04.594
It's amazing what a simple process it is
to print money.

23:04.730 --> 23:06.823
You heard Hank.
All you need is the equipment.

23:06.899 --> 23:09.629
But if you had the equipment
and the plates, for instance...

23:09.702 --> 23:11.761
you could make as much as you wanted.

23:11.937 --> 23:13.996
Millions or billions of dollars even.

23:14.306 --> 23:16.638
Sure. As long as the law didn't
catch up with you.

23:16.742 --> 23:19.734
What I was thinking about is
what it would do to the economy.

23:19.812 --> 23:22.508
Just destroy it completely, that's all.

23:23.682 --> 23:26.549
- You're wonderful.
- What did I say?

23:26.719 --> 23:29.449
Counterfeiting money
on a large scale like that...

23:29.521 --> 23:32.581
during wartime would be
a very potent economic weapon.

23:34.626 --> 23:35.615
Thanks.

23:50.943 --> 23:53.377
Why are these shades down?
We don't close for hours.

23:53.445 --> 23:56.608
- There's been a change of policy.
- Since when?

23:56.815 --> 23:59.545
I'm the owner and I'm the only one
that makes the changes.

23:59.618 --> 24:01.848
- You just did.
- What are you talking about?

24:02.054 --> 24:04.113
You just told me to close up the place.

24:04.590 --> 24:07.787
This is ridiculous.
I think you'd better leave.

24:09.895 --> 24:11.522
But I did tell him.

24:12.765 --> 24:15.461
And after all, I'm the owner here.

24:16.935 --> 24:19.460
And I'm the only one
that makes the changes.

24:23.041 --> 24:24.440
Hello, Maggie.

24:26.245 --> 24:28.145
Amazing likeness, isn't it?

24:29.515 --> 24:31.915
- I don't understand.
- You will.

24:32.417 --> 24:35.318
I want you to phone your fiancé.

24:35.487 --> 24:36.476
What for?

24:36.655 --> 24:39.715
Just tell him it's a matter
of life and death. Yours.

24:42.394 --> 24:44.123
They could bankrupt the Allies.

24:44.396 --> 24:47.194
It's not like 20s or 50s.
These are easy to pass.

24:47.466 --> 24:50.299
Every GI in the world
has got a few $2 bills in his pocket.

24:50.502 --> 24:52.629
Every factory worker,
shopkeeper, merchant.

24:52.871 --> 24:55.806
It's exactly the kind of thing
Wotan would instigate.

24:55.908 --> 24:58.604
Have you ordered Secret Service
protection for Hank Miller?

24:58.677 --> 24:59.905
I'll do it now.

25:00.212 --> 25:02.146
We've got a lot of work to do.

25:02.247 --> 25:04.647
Would you mind getting us some lunch?

25:04.716 --> 25:06.547
Oh, yes, certainly.

25:24.436 --> 25:26.165
Keep an eye on them.

25:28.740 --> 25:31.504
- What are they going to do to us?
- I don't know.

25:31.577 --> 25:33.477
Hank, I'm afraid.

25:54.433 --> 25:55.559
Yes? Who are you?

25:55.634 --> 25:58.865
Dan Fletcher.
Your guardian angel from now on.

26:01.807 --> 26:03.798
Major Trevor's office assigned me.

26:04.042 --> 26:06.977
Oh, fine. Sure. VIP stuff, huh?

26:29.935 --> 26:32.267
Just a take-out order, please.

26:33.238 --> 26:36.537
Two tuna fish. One on rye,
one on whole-wheat.

26:36.975 --> 26:41.639
A ham and cheese, two coffees, one black.
One tea with...

26:44.082 --> 26:46.050
lemon, please.

26:55.527 --> 26:56.960
That'll be $2.

27:00.332 --> 27:01.321
Certainly.

27:02.968 --> 27:04.731
One, two.

27:10.609 --> 27:13.305
I'll be back for the order in a moment.

27:56.688 --> 27:57.677
Hello.

27:57.756 --> 28:00.554
- Major Steve Trevor?
- Yeah, who's this?

28:00.625 --> 28:02.354
The name is Dan Fletcher.

28:02.494 --> 28:06.396
The Secret Service agent your office
ordered for protection of Hank Miller.

28:06.698 --> 28:10.134
I'm at the Capitol Cafe
and I think something is wrong.

28:11.069 --> 28:12.969
I'll explain when you get here.

28:19.211 --> 28:20.838
Hello, Maggie.

28:23.382 --> 28:25.316
After I signed my autograph
for you today...

28:25.384 --> 28:27.682
I realized I should have written
a personal message.

28:28.153 --> 28:29.814
Was it to your sister?

28:29.888 --> 28:32.448
Oh, yes. That's very nice of you.

28:33.025 --> 28:34.492
Here it is.

28:34.626 --> 28:37.993
- What's your sister's name?
- Evelyn.

28:39.698 --> 28:43.600
When I signed it, you said it
was for your brother in the service.

28:43.769 --> 28:45.964
Well, you see, my sister is married and...

28:46.038 --> 28:49.565
You're not Maggie Robbins.
You and I have never met before.

28:50.575 --> 28:52.304
But you and I have.

28:54.046 --> 28:55.775
Yes. Wotan.

28:57.115 --> 28:59.709
We've met before
on the beach at Smith Point.

29:03.055 --> 29:05.683
I've learned you have some
extraordinary powers...

29:05.757 --> 29:08.225
but it would be unwise of you
to use them now.

29:08.293 --> 29:12.923
You see, I'm holding two innocent people:
The real Maggie Robbins and Hank Miller.

29:12.998 --> 29:16.695
You wouldn't want what happens to them
on your conscience, would you?

29:17.069 --> 29:19.128
Hand me those bracelets.

29:20.605 --> 29:22.971
How do I know you're telling me the truth?

29:23.075 --> 29:25.669
That's easy to prove.
They're in the basement.

29:32.417 --> 29:33.406
Follow me.

29:53.472 --> 29:54.905
The bracelets.

30:19.131 --> 30:21.827
Get in there, or they'll be disposed of.

30:34.279 --> 30:37.373
This escapade has produced
an unexpected bonus.

30:37.449 --> 30:39.747
I think perhaps Berlin will have
plans for you.

30:39.885 --> 30:41.375
It won't be the first time.

30:41.453 --> 30:45.014
Previous plans failed because they
were executed by bungling incompetents.

30:45.190 --> 30:48.023
Whereas Wotan
will handle things differently.

30:48.226 --> 30:52.287
It's quite possible that these good people,
like yourself, will soon be eliminated.

30:52.397 --> 30:54.661
Please, you wouldn't kill us, would you?

30:54.733 --> 30:57.566
Why not? You're all
very unimportant specks...

30:57.636 --> 31:00.799
in the path of the greatest
political experience in history.

31:00.939 --> 31:03.533
The Third Reich shall rule the world.

31:05.043 --> 31:07.978
I remember Genghis Khan and Napoleon.

31:08.313 --> 31:09.678
What happened to them?

31:09.748 --> 31:12.478
They had their time. This is ours!

31:13.618 --> 31:17.418
- You, too, will fail.
- I never fail.

31:20.158 --> 31:21.455
And you know why?

31:22.260 --> 31:24.592
Tell me. I'm sure you're anxious to.

31:24.663 --> 31:27.791
Because I leave no loose ends. Ever.

31:28.233 --> 31:32.033
How do you expect to dispose of us
without the authorities finding out?

31:33.705 --> 31:36.503
I'll leave that to your imagination.

31:41.146 --> 31:45.344
In the meantime, you'll have to be content
with the knowledge that you're gonna die.

31:45.417 --> 31:49.444
Please, let my fiancée and Wonder Woman
go, I'll do anything you say.

31:49.521 --> 31:52.752
You have already played your role,
Mr. Miller. Admirably.

31:52.824 --> 31:56.521
In a few moments, you will be stealing
the engraving plates you guarded.

32:51.850 --> 32:55.149
- Nice to see you again.
- Hello, Major. You with us for lunch?

32:55.220 --> 32:58.883
I think so. I was supposed to meet
someone but maybe he changed his mind.

32:59.057 --> 33:01.924
Did a man come in and identify himself
as Secret Service?

33:02.460 --> 33:03.984
No. Why?

33:05.630 --> 33:08.827
Your fiancé, when was the last time
you talked with him?

33:09.401 --> 33:11.028
About an hour ago.

33:11.603 --> 33:12.934
Is everything all right?

33:13.238 --> 33:15.001
Oh, yes, I think so.

33:15.440 --> 33:17.431
Would you get him on the phone
for me, please?

33:17.575 --> 33:18.564
Of course.

33:24.282 --> 33:26.807
- On the house, Major.
- Thank you.

33:33.525 --> 33:34.890
Honey, just a minute.

33:37.729 --> 33:39.196
- Hello, Hank?
- Yes, Major.

33:39.297 --> 33:41.993
Did a Secret Service man
named Dan Fletcher contact you?

33:42.067 --> 33:45.059
Matter of fact, he did.
Came over, identified himself.

33:45.370 --> 33:46.667
Said you sent him.

33:46.771 --> 33:48.762
Told me he was my guardian angel.

33:48.840 --> 33:50.467
Did he go into the building with you?

33:50.542 --> 33:54.034
I was under the impression he'd
wait outside until I came out.

33:54.646 --> 33:56.477
After all, what could happen to me
in here?

33:56.548 --> 33:59.415
- Maybe I'd better come over.
- No reason, Major.

33:59.484 --> 34:01.918
I've got some extra time off.
I'm leaving early today.

34:01.986 --> 34:03.419
I'm on my way out now.

34:03.655 --> 34:04.644
All right.

34:07.092 --> 34:08.456
Is everything okay?

34:08.793 --> 34:10.351
Fine.

34:10.594 --> 34:12.290
Everything appears to be normal.

34:24.876 --> 34:27.106
Well, you'll have a nice quiet weekend.

34:28.679 --> 34:31.478
At least until tomorrow,
when this goes off.

34:37.822 --> 34:39.722
They won't know
which plates are missing.

34:48.400 --> 34:50.333
I ought to take care of you here and now.

34:50.635 --> 34:52.262
But maybe the other's better.

34:52.637 --> 34:56.471
The waiting, while all the while
the bomb ticks away.

35:30.675 --> 35:34.076
I can't understand what happened
to Fletcher. He's one of the best.

35:34.145 --> 35:37.171
If you don't mind, I'll stick with you
until a replacement shows up.

35:37.248 --> 35:38.738
Come on, that's not really necessary.

35:38.817 --> 35:40.250
What are they talking about?

35:40.351 --> 35:41.443
Don't get nervous.

35:41.553 --> 35:44.681
Appreciate your concern, but I don't think
I really need...

35:44.956 --> 35:46.218
What's wrong?

35:46.291 --> 35:47.952
I got a bad tooth.

35:48.059 --> 35:50.027
Must be a filling loose.

35:50.094 --> 35:52.324
It could be an abscess.
You should see a dentist.

35:52.397 --> 35:53.591
I'm sure it'll be all right.

35:53.665 --> 35:55.690
If it bothers me tomorrow,
I'll see a dentist.

35:55.767 --> 35:59.396
Tomorrow nothing. I've a friend here
who does great work.

35:59.504 --> 36:01.995
- Probably see you right away.
- He's probably busy.

36:05.543 --> 36:08.740
I said he's a buddy.
Besides, you're top priority.

36:08.913 --> 36:12.212
You're important to us.
Consider yourself requisitioned.

36:12.317 --> 36:14.649
- Let me tell Maggie then.
- Sure.

36:14.752 --> 36:17.152
Go ahead. I'll call a cab. Meet you here.

36:40.378 --> 36:42.642
He insists I go see his dentist.

36:43.448 --> 36:46.144
I told you to have that tooth fixed.

36:54.926 --> 36:58.487
Major Trevor must be eliminated.
As well as the others.

36:58.596 --> 37:00.223
No one must be left.

37:00.365 --> 37:03.334
No ragged edges. Do you understand?

37:03.735 --> 37:05.202
I understand.

37:09.440 --> 37:12.705
You know where we are to meet?
And what you have to do?

37:12.977 --> 37:13.966
I do.

37:39.938 --> 37:43.999
I said you were stealing the plates.
Well done.

37:44.075 --> 37:45.372
My country thanks you.

37:46.911 --> 37:48.071
I thank you.

37:48.279 --> 37:51.908
I am most grateful to all of you...

37:52.784 --> 37:54.479
for your participation.

38:01.459 --> 38:02.721
Auf Wiedersehen.

39:03.121 --> 39:05.919
- The bracelet is flexible.
- Yeah?

39:06.257 --> 39:09.920
Yes, there's a way to make it fit,
if that's what you wanna do.

39:09.994 --> 39:11.484
Let me show you.

39:11.896 --> 39:14.592
I know you'll grab it.
I know it stops bullets.

39:14.666 --> 39:17.430
- Just point and I'll do it.
- All right.

39:19.370 --> 39:23.238
Now look, you see the soft part
of your wrist in here.

39:24.375 --> 39:26.969
All you have to really do is just...

39:38.956 --> 39:40.184
Quickly.

39:46.030 --> 39:47.497
Go to the War Department.

39:47.565 --> 39:51.831
Tell the guard there you want to speak
to General Blankenship, no one else.

39:51.903 --> 39:54.701
Tell him what's happened here. And hurry.

40:07.618 --> 40:08.778
Steve.

40:11.556 --> 40:12.784
How is he?

40:16.561 --> 40:20.964
Maybe I've been seeing too many posters
about the enemy.

40:22.500 --> 40:24.131
You know what this is?

40:24.132 --> 40:26.163
Yeah, it's a filling.
Was that the trouble?

40:26.237 --> 40:30.333
There was some decay under it
causing pressure. He must've been in pain.

40:31.542 --> 40:34.136
Steve, this filling is made of steel.

40:35.113 --> 40:39.072
Now, I've heard that the Nazis are so short
of gold and silver...

40:39.150 --> 40:41.948
that they have to use steel for fillings.

40:44.922 --> 40:48.221
Of course.
Have you got much more to do on him?

40:48.593 --> 40:52.188
He's about finished. I put in a temporary,
told him to come back next week.

40:52.263 --> 40:54.857
- You didn't tell him about the filling?
- No.

40:54.932 --> 40:57.924
Good. I'll get you a medal
if what I'm thinking is right.

40:58.002 --> 40:59.697
A gold or silver one.

41:03.307 --> 41:04.774
Make it gold.

41:18.089 --> 41:19.613
Be back in a minute.

41:22.727 --> 41:25.127
Jason, what's going on down here?

41:38.276 --> 41:42.474
Where did Wotan take the plates?
What are his plans for the counterfeiting?

41:43.314 --> 41:45.407
I don't know. He didn't...

41:46.551 --> 41:51.215
Smith Point. He said he was
going to pick us up there.

41:53.291 --> 41:55.384
Well, Major, thank you very much.

41:55.459 --> 41:58.257
- But I don't want to keep you.
- No problem.

41:58.329 --> 41:59.489
Where's Maggie?

41:59.564 --> 42:02.465
Something going on in the basement.
Said she'd be right back.

42:04.268 --> 42:06.759
This is one boat you're both gonna miss.

42:07.438 --> 42:10.532
Service is bad enough
without her taking off like this.

42:12.276 --> 42:15.643
- Maybe we better take a look.
- No, you go on.

42:15.880 --> 42:18.474
- I'll take care of it.
- Now, wait just a minute.

42:18.683 --> 42:21.914
Remember, I told you. You're top priority.

42:49.180 --> 42:51.808
They've escaped.
Wonder Woman knows the plan.

42:52.350 --> 42:53.715
Stand back.

43:01.492 --> 43:02.584
Look out!

43:10.001 --> 43:13.300
Stop. Hold it. Inside.

43:22.647 --> 43:24.080
What about him?

43:24.315 --> 43:26.374
Another agent will take care
of Major Trevor.

43:27.018 --> 43:29.316
- Where's Fletcher?
- Is he that Secret Service man?

43:29.387 --> 43:33.289
- Yeah, what'd you do, kill him?
- He's locked in the vault with a bomb.

43:33.357 --> 43:35.325
But that won't matter to you.

43:43.200 --> 43:46.601
Sorry, the General's at the White House,
very high-level meeting.

43:46.671 --> 43:48.832
He'd have my head if I interrupted in there.

43:48.906 --> 43:51.204
Maggie, couldn't you tell me
what the problem is?

43:51.275 --> 43:53.971
Wonder Woman said
only the General Blankenship.

43:59.216 --> 44:02.117
Maybe I should call the General
at the White House.

44:50.067 --> 44:54.595
Yes, we're just in time. Our submarine
is due to surface in just three minutes.

45:25.269 --> 45:27.066
Check and see what that is.

45:27.138 --> 45:28.366
Quickly.

46:01.305 --> 46:02.465
There it is.

47:06.137 --> 47:07.695
You won this round.

47:08.572 --> 47:12.474
But at least we've eliminated Major Trevor
and that Secret Service agent.

47:12.543 --> 47:14.636
What have you done with them?

47:14.979 --> 47:17.447
- Where are they?
- Valhalla.

47:36.300 --> 47:37.631
Oh, bless you.

47:38.502 --> 47:40.800
Another five seconds,
we both would've bought it.

47:49.313 --> 47:51.679
I was so worried. He said you were dead.

47:51.749 --> 47:55.412
Nothing to worry about, Wonder Woman.
We handled this all on our own.

47:55.986 --> 47:57.453
For a change.

48:01.358 --> 48:05.089
Here it is, Etta. One copy for the General
and one for your file.

48:07.765 --> 48:10.825
Would you file this with it as a souvenir?

48:11.302 --> 48:13.998
- A $2 bill?
- The last of the $2 bills.

48:14.104 --> 48:16.470
The government decided
to take them out of circulation.

48:16.540 --> 48:19.771
They didn't want a chance of repetition
of Wotan's plan.

48:20.044 --> 48:22.035
The last of the $2 bills.

48:22.379 --> 48:26.247
- It seems historic in a way.
- In a way, I guess it is.

48:26.417 --> 48:30.080
I've read this copy of Dan Fletcher's report
to his superiors.

48:30.154 --> 48:33.214
All about the way you diffused the bomb
and saved him.

48:33.290 --> 48:35.258
- I really didn't...
- That's not in here.

48:35.326 --> 48:39.285
Just about the spies being captured
and the plates being recovered.

48:39.396 --> 48:41.830
Steve, you gave all the credit
to Wonder Woman.

48:41.899 --> 48:44.891
- Well, she deserves it.
- I guess you're right.

48:45.336 --> 48:49.102
When you come right down to it,
I don't know what we'd do without her.

48:49.173 --> 48:53.473
She is a wonder. Strong and fearless,
still compassionate.

48:54.712 --> 48:57.510
All the virtues of femininity
with none of the vices.

48:57.581 --> 49:01.176
You're right. Sometimes I wish
I was like Wonder Woman.

49:01.619 --> 49:04.713
Most of the time I wish
I was like Wonder Woman.

49:05.256 --> 49:07.315
There's only one Wonder Woman.

49:07.925 --> 49:12.419
I think the most we can do is try to be
the best women we can possibly be.

49:12.596 --> 49:15.087
- Sound advice, Diana.
- Thank you.

49:15.165 --> 49:17.861
It's just something my mother
used to tell me.

50:15.592 --> 50:16.581
