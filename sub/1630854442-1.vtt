WEBVTT

00:07.465 --> 00:08.633
Woo-hoo!

00:08.633 --> 00:10.135
Ho! Ho! Ho!

00:11.511 --> 00:15.598
<i>♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way ♪</i>

00:15.598 --> 00:19.102
<i>♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey! ♪</i>

00:19.102 --> 00:22.063
Look, I know it sucks to be working
on Christmas Eve.

00:22.063 --> 00:26.693
But, listen, if our delivery system
was working, we wouldn't have to.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.820
So, who can tell me
what our Christmas market share is?

00:28.820 --> 00:30.655
-<i>Six percent.</i>
- Oof.

00:32.323 --> 00:34.534
What's that 17% that says "other"?

00:34.534 --> 00:36.077
<i>We don't know.</i>

00:36.077 --> 00:37.537
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

00:37.537 --> 00:40.165
Come on! Full throttle, boys.
Come on, Comet. Get after it.

00:40.165 --> 00:43.043
Let's go. We gotta be a blur. Hyah!

00:43.043 --> 00:46.212
I need help with the tree!
Santa's gonna be here soon.

00:46.212 --> 00:47.881
Santa. Isn't that cute?

00:47.881 --> 00:49.758
All right, everybody.
Go be with your families.

00:49.758 --> 00:50.925
<i>I have no--</i>

00:50.925 --> 00:56.097
Now, we are gonna have a look-see
at what you've done, but then bed.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.021
Marauders.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.105
Come on, honey.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.400
Come on. Come on.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.571
Some kids at school think Santa's over.

01:11.571 --> 01:15.283
They say he still uses paper mail
and only delivers once a year.

01:15.283 --> 01:18.369
Well, honey, the older kids
are always gonna say Santa's not real.

01:18.369 --> 01:21.498
I didn't say he's not real.
I said he was over.

01:22.707 --> 01:24.834
Wait, is he not real?

01:24.834 --> 01:27.295
Oh, God. Your mother was
so much better at this stuff.

01:27.295 --> 01:28.922
I think it's safe to go back out.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.344
Whoa.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.263
Grace, you did this all by yourself?

01:38.348 --> 01:40.475
How'd you get the bow on top of the tree?

01:47.565 --> 01:49.442
Ho! Ho! Ho!

01:49.442 --> 01:51.861
Ooh! How about we buzz
the Statue of Liberty, Santa?

01:51.861 --> 01:55.115
Great idea, Noel. But first, cruller me!

02:00.453 --> 02:01.788
Hyah!

02:26.437 --> 02:27.438
Mmm!

02:27.438 --> 02:29.232
Yes!

02:29.232 --> 02:30.400
Delightful!

02:30.400 --> 02:31.734
Yeah, that's good!

02:32.861 --> 02:34.070
Boss is in a playful mood.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.990
It's gonna be one of those nights.
I bet you he doesn't finish on time.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.491
I'll take that bet, Crouton.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.914
No shenanigans in the control center.

02:44.914 --> 02:47.417
Sorry, boss, but elves gotta elf.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.668
Yeah, they do!

02:49.419 --> 02:51.588
Very well. Status report, Crouton.

02:51.588 --> 02:56.050
Santa's way slower than usual,
but somehow they're ahead of schedule.

02:56.050 --> 02:57.218
How is that possible?

03:01.681 --> 03:04.809
Wait, is this the whole list?

03:05.977 --> 03:09.522
This can't be the whole list.
This is getting shorter every year.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.232
What's going on?

03:11.983 --> 03:12.984
Hold on.

03:18.323 --> 03:21.409
What are we doing here?
This house isn't on the list.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.328
That's gotta be some sort of mistake.

03:24.495 --> 03:27.081
This is always one of my favorite stops.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.586
I think the milk's a little sour.

03:31.586 --> 03:32.921
It's soy milk.

03:34.130 --> 03:36.382
You said you were lactose intolerant.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.509
I did say that, didn't I?

03:39.302 --> 03:40.887
Thanks for remembering. Go to sleep.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.059
Merry Christmas, Sara.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.602
Merry Christmas, Santa.

03:47.602 --> 03:48.811
You know what?

03:48.811 --> 03:51.231
I'm gonna find out why
this house isn't on the list.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.235
So, we're just doing home invasions now?

03:55.235 --> 03:58.154
Come on. It's all good.
Listen, it's better than good.

03:58.154 --> 04:00.031
It's santastic.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.115
Never gets old.

04:01.115 --> 04:03.451
This actually tickles a little bit.

04:15.213 --> 04:17.548
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:17.548 --> 04:18.633
You scared me.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.552
Calm down. No, no, no.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

04:21.552 --> 04:24.597
No, no, no.
I'm here to see Sara, your daughter.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.557
- She'll vouch for me.
- I'm Sara!

04:26.557 --> 04:29.310
Oh, oh. Stop. Stop. What am I thinking?

04:29.310 --> 04:31.938
A blink of an eye and, what,
28 years go by.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.731
At least I look the same.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.108
Who are you?

04:36.109 --> 04:37.110
I'm Santa Claus.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.612
Lactose intolerant. You gave me soy milk.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.531
- Listen to me, you wacko, okay?
- Oh.

04:41.531 --> 04:44.075
Santa's not real,
and I have run out of things to throw,

04:44.075 --> 04:46.577
so I'm gonna ask you really,
really nicely to please leave.

04:47.161 --> 04:50.039
I understand.
Adults lose their belief in magic.

04:50.039 --> 04:51.332
It just grows out of them.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.127
But how do you not remember me?

04:54.836 --> 04:57.005
I don't remember much, man.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.882
I'm an adult woman living with my parents.

04:59.882 --> 05:04.304
I mean, my life is one endless, blurry,
long day broken up by <i>Judge Judys.</i>

05:04.304 --> 05:07.557
Wow. Of all the kids in the world,

05:08.474 --> 05:11.561
I would never imagine
that you'd stop believing.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.271
- Okay...
- Hmm.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.566
...let's pretend you are Santa.

05:16.566 --> 05:19.068
I mean, why are you even here?

05:19.068 --> 05:20.486
I get all my presents online,

05:20.486 --> 05:24.365
and to tell you the truth,
I forgot tonight was Christmas Eve.

05:24.365 --> 05:28.786
Well, that's too bad 'cause
then you're probably not gonna want this.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.499
Oh, my God. I haven't thought of Polly
since I was a little girl.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.500
Yeah.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.420
My mom got rid of her 'cause I threw her
a pool party in the toilet.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.548
It was a Polly Pocket potty party.

05:45.011 --> 05:48.097
Oh, my God. It is you.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.725
Merry Christmas, Sara.

05:51.392 --> 05:52.977
Merry Christmas, Santa.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.648
I'll-- I'll let you do your thing.

05:58.733 --> 05:59.734
Thank you.

06:06.115 --> 06:08.701
The heck is happening? Come on.

06:11.621 --> 06:16.459
Noel. Noel. Need a little help. Noel!

06:24.342 --> 06:26.427
Kind of jiggle the lock to get it open.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.137
Santa?

06:29.347 --> 06:32.016
Best friend? You there?

06:33.393 --> 06:35.812
Santa? Hello?

06:36.479 --> 06:37.897
All right.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.650
Noel, take a breath. Breathe. Breathe!

06:40.650 --> 06:42.902
All right, look. We gotta go.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.908
Milk and cookies.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.668
Are you okay?

06:59.544 --> 07:00.545
Who said that?

07:02.964 --> 07:04.549
Hey, Mom.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.385
Cal, what did we say
about playing these games?

07:07.385 --> 07:08.845
You get all carried away

07:08.845 --> 07:11.431
and can't tell the difference
between fantasy and reality.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.598
Yes, I'm real!

07:12.598 --> 07:13.683
Okay, okay, okay.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.102
But is that real?

07:18.187 --> 07:20.231
Lewis, I made popcorn.

07:20.731 --> 07:22.942
- Oh. Hey, Mom.
- Oh, hey.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.611
Lewis and I were watching
a movie about Santa.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.363
We can't believe how much they get wrong.

07:27.363 --> 07:28.448
I'm sure.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.950
You kids should really be in bed.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.786
You know, your dad loves to see you
when he gets back from his rounds.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.080
But the best part of Christmas
is over by then.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.748
I know, and he wishes he could be here.

07:37.748 --> 07:38.958
But he has to be there--

07:38.958 --> 07:40.543
For all the children of the world.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.044
Right.

07:42.044 --> 07:44.589
Okay, bed. Both of you.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.007
I'm sorry, Lewis.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.134
I guess we'll have
to finish movie night another time.

07:52.763 --> 07:55.641
Wow, 28 years.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.977
Twenty-eight years, wow. Twenty-eight--

07:57.977 --> 08:00.104
Why do you keep mumbling, "28 years"?

08:00.104 --> 08:02.732
Twenty-eight years, that's how long
I've been doing this, you know?

08:02.732 --> 08:04.066
Where does the time go?

08:04.066 --> 08:05.693
I believe it flies, doesn't it?

08:05.693 --> 08:09.322
And all those kids turned into adults,
you know? They stopped believing--

08:10.531 --> 08:14.577
Oh, holy night!
The magic reserves are running low.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.787
No, they're not.
The gauge is old. It doesn't even work.

08:16.787 --> 08:19.665
It's made out of candy or something.
Couldn't get better than tonight!

08:19.665 --> 08:22.793
- This is a good night. We are cruising.
- Why are you talking weird like that?

08:22.793 --> 08:25.880
It's not weird when I talk like this.
It's only weird when I talk like this.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.632
Wait just a taffy-licking minute.

08:28.257 --> 08:30.009
How did you get back
on the roof of that house

08:30.009 --> 08:32.053
when I was looking down the chimney
the whole time?

08:32.053 --> 08:34.388
Come on, Noel.
A good Santa never gives up his secrets.

08:35.681 --> 08:37.350
Blitzen, get back here.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.684
Okay. All right. Calm down.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.853
Why-- Why do you smell like taffy?

08:40.853 --> 08:42.563
Why do you smell like despair?

08:42.563 --> 08:44.232
Is that an odor? Despair?

08:44.232 --> 08:45.775
What is going on?

08:45.775 --> 08:47.151
Uh...

08:47.151 --> 08:48.236
Listen.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.404
Okay, you can't tell anybody,

08:50.404 --> 08:53.032
but my magic may have failed me tonight.
It's no big deal.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.618
- We're 10,000 feet in the air...
- Almost eleven-five.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.286
...being pulled by flying livestock...

08:57.286 --> 08:59.080
They hate being called livestock.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.164
...that depend on magic.

09:00.164 --> 09:01.958
- That's, in fact, true.
- No big deal?

09:01.958 --> 09:04.168
Whoa! Boys, come on! Pull it up!

09:04.168 --> 09:06.254
Crouton, we have a problem!

09:06.254 --> 09:07.755
Come on, guys!

09:22.103 --> 09:23.396
Whoa!

09:23.396 --> 09:24.981
Boys, come on! Pull it up!

09:25.481 --> 09:26.524
<i>Guys!</i>

09:26.524 --> 09:28.818
What did you do?
This has your fingerprints all over it.

09:28.818 --> 09:29.819
Wrong.

09:29.819 --> 09:33.114
My fingers are covered with chocolate.
You did something wrong.

09:33.114 --> 09:36.492
I have never done anything wrong, ever.
My record is flawless.

09:36.492 --> 09:40.621
Technically,
less flaw can still mean some flaw!

09:40.621 --> 09:42.748
Noel? Santa?

09:42.748 --> 09:44.709
Santa, Santa, do you copy?

09:47.003 --> 09:48.671
You better let the missus know.

09:49.755 --> 09:54.594
Sandra, this, uh...
...furry friends thing.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.679
It's, um, getting out of hand.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.681
Well, what choice do I have?

09:58.681 --> 10:00.308
There's no kids my age around here,

10:00.308 --> 10:02.560
and sometimes
I just need someone to talk to.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.729
But they don't talk back.
Do they?

10:04.729 --> 10:07.106
No, Mom. They're-- They're animals.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.900
I'm not crazy. I'm just lonely sometimes.

10:12.236 --> 10:14.530
I know it isn't easy living
in the North Pole.

10:14.530 --> 10:15.781
Yeah. But I'm doing fine.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.242
I mean, you should be the one
that's complaining.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.911
Why? I'm fine. I'm-- I'm-- I'm happy.

10:20.911 --> 10:23.539
Of course you are
because being cheery is your whole deal.

10:23.539 --> 10:24.874
My whole deal?

10:24.874 --> 10:27.710
I mean,
you ever look up past Mrs. Clauses?

10:27.710 --> 10:29.837
It's an old lady who knits and bakes.

10:29.837 --> 10:32.256
I mean,
she doesn't even have a first name.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.300
That's not true. I have a first name.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.718
- No, you don't.
- I do.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.304
- It's, um... It's Nancy.
- No--

10:38.304 --> 10:40.306
- Nanta.
- That's not a name.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.766
Shanta.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.517
Is that what you want us to call you?

10:47.772 --> 10:50.566
What's going on, Betty?
My husband's sleigh is missing?

10:50.566 --> 10:51.901
Well, not exactly.

10:51.901 --> 10:56.072
His sleigh came back,
but Santa doesn't appear to be in it.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.365
How is that possible?

11:05.873 --> 11:08.209
Oh, no! It happened again.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.336
But then, where's the new Santa?

11:10.336 --> 11:12.963
Please let it be Harry Styles.
Please, please, please, please.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.513
Fooled ya!

11:20.513 --> 11:21.972
Yes.

11:21.972 --> 11:24.058
Good one, big man!

11:24.058 --> 11:26.936
I wasn't nervous at all--

11:26.936 --> 11:28.521
Somebody get some hay on that.

11:28.521 --> 11:32.942
Listen, I want to congratulate everybody
on another great Christmas.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.443
We did it, right?

11:34.443 --> 11:39.115
You know, I don't say this enough,
but being Santa has meant the world to me.

11:39.115 --> 11:43.953
Once a year, I get to spread joy and magic
to people everywhere,

11:43.953 --> 11:45.788
but I couldn't do it without all of you.

11:45.788 --> 11:49.208
Especially you two,
Joy and Magic.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.627
But this Santa is nothing
without his elves.

11:51.627 --> 11:52.795
Tell ya that.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.881
Which means you've all earned
a huge vacation!

11:58.217 --> 12:00.720
Or we could go down to the shop
and start making toys!

12:00.720 --> 12:03.097

It went fine. Noel?

12:27.121 --> 12:28.956
Noel? Ugh.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.208
Very good. I guess
all the malfunctions were on our side.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.711
- You're darn tootin'.
- We'll get it fixed,

12:33.711 --> 12:37.381
and I'll make a note in my report
that everyone else was acting weird.

12:37.381 --> 12:38.549

12:57.943 --> 13:00.029
Yeah?
They told me your sleigh was missing.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.364
Well, you can't believe
everything you hear, can ya?

13:02.364 --> 13:04.408
I'm sorry, Santa.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.535
Are you saying that the elves were lying?

13:08.037 --> 13:09.872
Elves don't lie.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.665
What do you take us for? Gnomes?

13:11.665 --> 13:13.751
Can we talk about this later?

13:13.751 --> 13:15.169
- Okay.
- I'm gonna take a little nap.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.087
Then we're gonna have
our belated Christmas.

13:17.087 --> 13:20.049
You and I will have a nice talk
after the kids pass out under the tree.

13:20.049 --> 13:23.135
They're not little kids anymore.
They don't pass out under the tree.

13:25.763 --> 13:29.183
So, are you gonna tell me
what happened on your rounds?

13:30.684 --> 13:34.480
- It's actually a little embarrassing.
- Hey, you know you can tell me anything.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.442
Well, you know,
we're sliding into vortexes,

13:38.442 --> 13:40.444
you know,
jumping in and out of dimensions.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.112
It was pretty normal, you know?

13:42.112 --> 13:45.115
Actually, it wasn't normal at all.
It was different out there.

13:45.115 --> 13:46.826
Okay, what was different?

13:46.826 --> 13:50.162
The world is different, honey.
It's people.

13:50.162 --> 13:54.750
You know? It's like they're misfiring.
They're disconnected.

13:54.750 --> 13:55.918
It was fine.

13:57.378 --> 14:00.047
It was fine. Then my magic failed.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.882
Oh.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.634
Wow. Okay.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.469
- Well, that happens.
- Mm-hmm.

14:05.469 --> 14:08.597
It happens? How many Santas
do you know? It never happened to me.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.517
- No, I'm just saying that you're 65...
- Yeah.

14:11.517 --> 14:15.813
...and that this is when people your age,
they slow down,

14:15.813 --> 14:18.399
they start to enjoy their lives,
they retire, they--

14:18.399 --> 14:21.360
Oh! [laughs] Retire?

14:22.653 --> 14:23.737
Okay.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.991
You don't retire in this business.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.826
Apparently, what you do is,
you get startled,

14:28.826 --> 14:31.662
you slip off a roof into a snowbank,
hand a card to some stranger.

if there was a Mrs. Claus before me?

14:43.507 --> 14:44.758
Say that again?

14:44.758 --> 14:47.052
When you scared the last Santa to death,

14:47.052 --> 14:48.804
and you took over his job,

14:48.804 --> 14:51.473
did he, in fact, have a wife?

14:53.058 --> 14:54.059
Hmm.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.477
I-- You know, I don't know.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.313
You never bothered to ask?

14:57.313 --> 14:59.106
He wasn't in a talkative mood.

14:59.106 --> 15:01.150
He'd fallen off the roof
into a pile of snow.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.944
No final words?
No, "Tell Myrtle I love her"?

15:03.944 --> 15:05.029
Ha. Her name is Myrtle?

15:05.029 --> 15:06.989
No. And do you know why?

15:06.989 --> 15:09.158
Because Mrs. Claus
doesn't have a first name.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.409
I don't have a first name.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.493
It's Carol.

15:11.493 --> 15:13.495
At least, you know,
that's what I call you.

15:13.495 --> 15:15.331
Wait a minute. Maybe your name isn't Carol

15:15.331 --> 15:17.499
because sometimes I call you
and you don't answer me.

15:17.499 --> 15:18.834
Carol was my before name.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.295
Is this going to become a thing?

15:21.295 --> 15:25.174
No, you asking me to marry you
and then gaining 200 pounds was a thing.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.634
This is much bigger.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.053
Yes. Tell you what.

15:29.053 --> 15:31.221
Why don't I start us a fire, huh?

15:31.221 --> 15:32.640
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh!

15:33.682 --> 15:34.850
Oh.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.936
Not again. Not again.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.313
This is-- Look at this--
It did-- It didn't, um--

15:39.313 --> 15:43.192
Did you just attempt to escape
up the chimney to flee this conversation?

15:43.192 --> 15:44.610
No. Yeah, I--

15:44.610 --> 15:46.028
No.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.112
- No?
- No, I was doing--

15:47.112 --> 15:50.532
Gonna-- When I--
Well, we could see it that way.

15:50.532 --> 15:52.034
Yeah, yeah. That's what I was doing.

15:54.828 --> 15:57.957
Well, I'm giving you the worst news
a Santa Claus can get.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.334
- Oh, no.
- You've lost weight.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.211
Oh, no!

16:02.211 --> 16:04.838
I knew it. I knew it.
That's why I'm feeling so sluggish.

16:04.838 --> 16:07.049
And my belly's not moving like it used to
when I laugh.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.343
It's not a belly full of jelly anymore.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.762
You are down to only three chins.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.890
And sometimes when I bend over,
I'm starting to be able to see my feet.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.225
Wait a minute, Doc. Doc.

16:17.476 --> 16:18.519
Am I dying?

16:18.519 --> 16:19.853
No. No, no, no.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.398
- But I am alarmed.
- Yeah?

16:22.398 --> 16:25.025
Is there anything else going on
that I should know about?

16:26.318 --> 16:30.531
Uh, you know-- Well, no. No.
Mm-mmm. I don't think so. No.

16:30.531 --> 16:34.743
Okay, so everything's great
with, let's say, uh, your magic?

16:36.453 --> 16:37.997
All right.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.915
Who dropped a dime on me?

16:39.915 --> 16:42.501
Mrs. Claus? Noel?

16:42.501 --> 16:45.921
That was all said in confidence.
And, uh-- And none of it was true.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.007
- Okay.
- Change of subject.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.385
Hypothetical. Just a hypothetical,
'cause we're both science people.

16:51.385 --> 16:54.179
What would it take to make Santa
less than a Santa?

16:54.179 --> 16:56.348
What would have to happen?
I mean, just hypothetically.

16:56.348 --> 17:01.770
Uh... Okay. Well, in-- in theory,
a loss of magic would be caused

17:01.770 --> 17:07.317
by all the children not believing in
or needing Santa anymore.

17:07.317 --> 17:09.611
But it's probably just physical.

17:09.611 --> 17:13.991
And if this continues, then yes,
you're gonna look ripped.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.326
That's awfully close to body-shaming.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.537
- Sorry.
- I've got to get out of shape.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.165

the "Eye of the Kringle."

You're killing me here, Edie.

20:36.652 --> 20:41.490
And actually, sir, we're not supposed
to say naughty anymore.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.409
It's the misunderstood list,
and they also get gifts.

20:46.495 --> 20:48.288

20:48.288 --> 20:50.165
Sir, you love these confabs.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.417
I used to love it.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.711
Is there some way I can delegate this
to somebody else?

20:54.711 --> 20:56.463
Ooh. That's exciting.

20:56.463 --> 20:59.925
How about all girls are nice
and all boys are naughty?

20:59.925 --> 21:02.261
Just like how all cats are girls
and all dogs are boys.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.762
Literally a couple of seconds ago,

21:03.762 --> 21:05.973
you said we weren't allowed
to say naughty or nice.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.433
Well, that was before I felt the power.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.894
See, sir? This is why we can't delegate.

21:10.894 --> 21:13.605
We are days away from Christmas.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.653
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

21:26.994 --> 21:30.747
So, you're probably closer to Santa
than anyone else.

21:30.747 --> 21:35.294
Could you say that one more time but
slower, louder and into my tape recorder?

21:35.294 --> 21:36.378
No.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.966
I've been thinking about Santa,
and do you think he's still got it?

21:40.966 --> 21:43.760
That's the golly-darndest question
anyone's ever asked.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.053
He's Santa!

21:45.053 --> 21:46.888
Yes, and we all love him.

21:46.888 --> 21:52.019
But we've seen what happens
when Santas lose their zest for the job.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.103
They get crankier.

21:53.103 --> 21:54.479
Crankiness is part of his charm.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.898
- They stop caring.
- I don't care for this conversation.

21:56.898 --> 21:59.693
- And accidents happen.
- Na, na, na, na, na, na, na.

21:59.693 --> 22:00.777
Look.

22:02.029 --> 22:04.740
- There's something in the air.
- Like bubbles?

22:04.740 --> 22:06.033
I love bubbles.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.744
Letters to Santa are down.

22:08.744 --> 22:12.414
Children hold the spirit of Christmas
in their hearts.

22:12.414 --> 22:16.043
If kids don't believe as much anymore,
the magic fades.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.669
I think Santa's feeling it,

22:17.669 --> 22:22.341
and if it affects his job,
it could be the end of Christmas.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.300
No!

22:23.300 --> 22:26.053
And what do you think happens to us?
To elves?

22:26.053 --> 22:27.179
What? What?

22:27.179 --> 22:29.056
Christmas is our purpose.

22:29.056 --> 22:33.226
If it goes away, I don't know,
maybe we go away.

22:33.226 --> 22:35.270
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na!

22:35.270 --> 22:37.773
I need you to report
any signs of Santa faltering.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.275
But, Honeybuns...

22:40.275 --> 22:41.526
No.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.528
At home, I'm Honeybuns.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.781
At work, I'm your boss.

22:48.075 --> 22:50.744
Okay, here you go.
Gloves and all that. Yeah. Thanks.

22:50.744 --> 22:51.661
- Dad.
- Yeah?

22:51.661 --> 22:55.290
I wanted to give you your present before
you left, but it hasn't come yet, so...

22:55.290 --> 22:56.792
You ordered me something online?

22:56.792 --> 22:59.711
In case you haven't noticed, we have
a workshop right here at the North Pole.

22:59.711 --> 23:00.796
He may not have noticed.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.589
No, the workshop here is just too loud,

23:02.589 --> 23:05.759
and you know the elves make lousy tech
'cause they just get nutmeg in everything.

23:05.759 --> 23:08.678
But your gift is gonna blow you away,
if it comes.

23:08.678 --> 23:11.139
- You know how you love roller coasters?
- No.

23:11.139 --> 23:13.600
Now you can ride them
without ever leaving your couch.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.227
You know me so well, Cal.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.311
Nice.

23:16.311 --> 23:18.397
Well, Dad,
I got you a present you can open now.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.065
Oh. Well, isn't that nice?

23:20.065 --> 23:21.358
What do we got here?

23:21.358 --> 23:24.319
So it's a list of Christmas tree lots
that put deer in cages

23:24.319 --> 23:27.114
that they try to pass off as reindeer.

23:27.114 --> 23:29.408
I put bolt cutters in your sleigh
so you can set them free.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.493
We can't set deer free in big cities.

23:31.493 --> 23:34.037
Hipsters just put fedoras on them,
honey, but thank you so much.

23:34.037 --> 23:36.415
Well, maybe you can bring them back to me.

23:36.415 --> 23:40.836
Well, the Christmas rounds are all about
giving, not receiving, sweetheart.

23:40.836 --> 23:41.920
Can I come with you?

23:42.879 --> 23:43.880
Okay, you know what?

23:43.880 --> 23:46.967
Let's talk about this next year, Sandra.
Let's give your old dad a break.

23:46.967 --> 23:49.136
Is the word "old" really necessary?

23:49.136 --> 23:51.888
Okay, let's give your not-so-old dad
a big hug, yeah?

23:52.639 --> 23:54.641
- I love you guys.
- Yeah. Love you back.

23:55.350 --> 23:57.436
I really do wish I could spend this time
with you guys.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.979
It's okay, Dad. We understand.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.105
Yeah.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.774
Hey, be careful.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.401
I have a bad feeling about tonight.

24:04.401 --> 24:06.653
You have a bad feeling? Wow.

24:06.653 --> 24:09.448
Maybe Mrs. Claus's first name is Bummer.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.950
You're right. Drive fast, be careless.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.578
- Love you.
- I love you.

24:14.578 --> 24:15.787
Okay, everybody.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.289
Okay, babes.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.041
And to all, a good night.

24:29.342 --> 24:32.345
What do you say we air this thing out?
To the Holly Jolly Highway!

24:32.345 --> 24:33.513
Hyah!

24:33.513 --> 24:35.432
New York.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.477
London.

24:40.353 --> 24:41.354
Paris.

24:43.899 --> 24:44.900
Munich.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.777
<i>Everybody talk about pop muzik ♪</i>

24:49.154 --> 24:50.989
- Hyah!
- Okay.

24:50.989 --> 24:52.741
For our first stop, it's...

24:53.658 --> 24:55.827
Wait. No. Not this year.

24:55.827 --> 24:56.912
Hmm.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.914
All right.
That just gives us more time to--

24:59.956 --> 25:00.957
Huh.

25:00.957 --> 25:02.459
He's not on here either.

25:03.543 --> 25:05.837
Whoa! Blitzen, come on. We're good.

25:05.837 --> 25:07.506
We're fi-- We're fine. We're fine.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.925
Ah. Here we go. Myrin Fischer.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.468
All right.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.094
Get down there. Let's go.

25:18.225 --> 25:19.309
Oh, man.

25:19.309 --> 25:21.353
No! [whistles] Comet, uh-uh!

25:21.353 --> 25:24.481
- Do you want me to go with you?
- No, you just want a snickerdoodle.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.150
And no, I don't need you to go with me.
I got this. Watch.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.654
See?

25:31.238 --> 25:32.364
It's all good.

25:34.741 --> 25:39.996
<i>Tonight, we welcome
Simon Choksi, the CEO of EverythingNow!</i>

25:40.539 --> 25:42.374
- Oh, soot!
-<i>You know, here at 42 News,</i>

25:42.374 --> 25:44.459
-<i>we like to cut right to the chase.</i>
- I need a cookie.

25:44.459 --> 25:47.546
I need a cookie. I need a cookie.
Where are the cookies?

25:47.546 --> 25:50.173
<i>Simon, your EN-3000 was supposed
to be the Christmas gift of the year...</i>

25:50.173 --> 25:52.217
They're right here usually. Cookie.

25:52.217 --> 25:54.386
<i>...but you have failed to deliver,
quite literally. True?</i>

25:54.386 --> 25:55.303
 Still up?

25:55.303 --> 25:58.723
<i>We said that the EN-3000
would arrive by Christmas.</i>

25:58.723 --> 26:01.226
<i>We just didn't say which Christmas.</i>

26:01.226 --> 26:03.144
<i>I told you a joke was a bad idea, Hassan.</i>

26:04.062 --> 26:07.482
Look, I crushed it in the toy
and video game business, right?

26:07.482 --> 26:10.569
But yes, when we expanded
to e-commerce, we had a few--

26:10.569 --> 26:12.779
- Catastrophes.
- Hiccups. Come on.

26:12.779 --> 26:14.823
Well, some say you tried
to grow too big too fast.

26:14.823 --> 26:18.994
Well, like Molière said, you know,
"Don't hate the player, hate the game."

26:20.579 --> 26:22.414
Darn it, Hassan! That didn't work either.

26:23.164 --> 26:25.250
Look, bottom line,
I'll be honest with you.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.919
EverythingNow!
will deliver everything now!

26:28.670 --> 26:30.297
Or in four to six weeks, all right?

26:30.297 --> 26:33.967
So, what do you say to all your customers
whose stockings will be empty tomorrow?

26:33.967 --> 26:35.468
Do something, do something.

26:35.468 --> 26:37.345
Come on.
We can't all be Santa Claus.

26:44.936 --> 26:47.188
Hey, thanks for bailing me out, man.

26:47.188 --> 26:49.858
That was a stress nightmare come to life.

26:50.859 --> 26:52.527
Did you say something, sir?

26:52.527 --> 26:54.696
I can't hear anything over the loud buzz.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.408
Hassan, are you seeing this?

26:59.826 --> 27:02.037
I only see giant black dots.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.788
It's rather unsettling.

27:05.373 --> 27:06.374
Where'd he go?

27:06.374 --> 27:08.752
Who, me? Am I invisible now?

27:08.752 --> 27:10.420
I mean, I've always felt not seen.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.088
There's no way that was real.

27:12.922 --> 27:16.134
But if it is, why can't we do the same?

27:22.015 --> 27:23.516
It's a beautiful night.

27:24.517 --> 27:26.227
Yeah, I guess so.

27:26.227 --> 27:28.271
Hey, let me ask you a question.

27:28.271 --> 27:32.025
Do you think folks are having
less children or are kids just, um...

27:32.025 --> 27:33.318
Are kids just what?

27:34.027 --> 27:36.821
Ah, never mind, never mind. Huh.

27:36.821 --> 27:40.283
Hey, Santa! You wanna
loop the loop the St. Louis Arch?

27:40.283 --> 27:43.161
Nah, we got a lot of work to do.
Let's just get this over with.

27:44.579 --> 27:45.747
Get it over with?

27:47.749 --> 27:49.751
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

27:50.251 --> 27:51.419
All right.

27:51.419 --> 27:52.545
Are you okay, Santa?

27:53.630 --> 27:56.966
The truth is, I've been letting the world
affect my Christmas spirit.

27:58.301 --> 28:00.553
I know I haven't been as fun
as I used to be.

28:00.553 --> 28:04.557
Are you kidding?
Any time with you is the best time, Santa.

28:05.892 --> 28:07.519
Right back at you, Noel.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.647
You know what?
I'm not gonna let this affect me.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.698
Almost, almost, almost, almost.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.742
Oh, no. Something's happening again.

28:22.742 --> 28:24.077
Why? What--

28:24.077 --> 28:25.370
Santa?

28:25.370 --> 28:27.914
- Best friend? Are you okay?
- I can't even touch my nose.

28:27.914 --> 28:30.125
- What's happening?
- Oh, no.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.626
- Santa!
- Whoa, whoa!

28:31.626 --> 28:33.461
- Your sack. What's going on?
- Whoa. Whoa.

28:33.461 --> 28:35.088
- I--
- Santa!

28:36.756 --> 28:37.924
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
