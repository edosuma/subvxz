00:01.302 --> 00:03.025
I'm a journalist, Mr. Frost.

00:03.027 --> 00:05.839
I'm working on a story about Her
Royal Highness Princess Eleanor

00:05.841 --> 00:07.958
and the relationship she's
having with her bodyguard.

00:07.960 --> 00:11.265
- James? Did he say where he was going?
- No, he didn't.

00:11.266 --> 00:13.400
He simply asked for some time away.

00:13.400 --> 00:16.335
His name is Brandon Boone,
24 years old, military.

00:16.335 --> 00:17.957
- Prince Robert was killed.
- By you.

00:17.957 --> 00:19.256
- There's no need for that.
- I think there is.

00:19.257 --> 00:20.341
It's been established.

00:20.341 --> 00:22.641
- Good morning, Your Majesty.
- Do you want to have sex?

00:23.545 --> 00:25.545
Put 'em up, Sparrow!

00:25.545 --> 00:27.347
Just trying to give them a good show.

00:27.347 --> 00:30.016
You give them a good show.
I'll give them a good fight.

00:30.018 --> 00:32.418
I think I've solved our bodyguard issue.

00:32.420 --> 00:34.920
- Oh, have you now, Princess?
- Yes. Rosie.

00:34.921 --> 00:37.290
I'm Sebastian. This is my number.

00:37.292 --> 00:40.226
- If you want to hang out...
- It wouldn't be a date.

00:40.228 --> 00:41.762
I've heard all about you, Mr. Parker.

00:41.762 --> 00:45.097
The charming, fabulously
wealthy American investor.

00:45.098 --> 00:47.819
I have cancer, and it
appears to be winning.

00:47.820 --> 00:51.189
- Good fight, big brother.
- Did you think you'd actually beat me?

00:51.191 --> 00:52.658
You want to find out?

02:49.241 --> 02:52.444
I just thought heels are

- Not really naked, right?

03:20.134 --> 03:21.985
Well, yes, people will be naked,

03:21.986 --> 03:25.807
- as in completely naked.
- But not us, right?

- You are such a slut.
- From before.

I had to get it cleaned.

04:26.110 --> 04:27.976
That's my move.

You spill something on his shirt,

shirt, or find out about us.

I'm going to go and
return the shirt to Liam

05:25.367 --> 05:28.567
the symbolic representation
of your heart's desire,

05:28.569 --> 05:32.071
a crystal bathed in the
light of a full moon,

05:32.072 --> 05:34.941
the blood of a powerful predator,

05:34.942 --> 05:38.043
and £65,000, preferably in cash.

05:38.045 --> 05:40.045
Kind of pricey for a holy man.

05:40.047 --> 05:44.584

we will heal your soul.

05:44.584 --> 05:46.663
It will not be easy.

Don't count me out, birdman.

05:53.528 --> 05:55.661

05:55.661 --> 05:58.071
Heart's desire, full moon crystal,

05:58.072 --> 06:00.266
- blood of a beast...
- And £65,000.

you fine-feathered freak.

- No.

06:30.774 --> 06:32.665

Oh, so you've told Brady all about it?

06:35.180 --> 06:36.201
You need to go.

06:36.202 --> 06:37.476
- Cute kid.
- Get out.

06:37.478 --> 06:38.639
How old is he now, eight?

06:39.733 --> 06:42.211
- I'm calling the police.
- And telling them what?

06:42.213 --> 06:44.439
That you ran drugs for
a low-rent sheikh?

06:44.441 --> 06:45.723
Or, in the grand scheme of things,

06:45.725 --> 06:47.495
having drugs inside you
was more palatable

06:47.495 --> 06:50.606
than having the sheikh inside you,
which is nothing to be ashamed of.

06:52.005 --> 06:54.319
Are you enjoying yourself?

06:54.319 --> 06:55.689
I was...

06:56.894 --> 07:00.927
until you ambled into my path and
cost me everything I cared about.

07:00.927 --> 07:02.172
So put your phone down

07:02.173 --> 07:04.997

stubborn, reckless life,

07:04.997 --> 07:06.600
shut your mouth and listen.

07:06.601 --> 07:09.894
You're gonna bury the story
about the Princess and me,

07:09.896 --> 07:12.201
and in return, I'm
gonna give you a story

07:12.202 --> 07:14.327
that will provide the foundation of...

07:15.069 --> 07:17.228
whatever it is you're trying to become.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.576
What story?

07:20.233 --> 07:22.276
Do we understand each other?

07:25.452 --> 07:26.920
Good.

07:29.132 --> 07:30.247
Hey.

07:35.862 --> 07:37.562
Why would you help me?

07:39.500 --> 07:43.601
Sometimes I wish I could just
go back and wipe my past.

07:44.377 --> 07:45.670
Start over.

07:46.569 --> 07:49.307
Well, if I can't have that
chance, maybe you can.

07:51.730 --> 07:53.271
So take it.

08:07.398 --> 08:09.632
Where's my security detail?

08:09.632 --> 08:11.077
I feel stupid.

08:11.079 --> 08:13.045
Well, it's not about you, is it?

08:14.915 --> 08:17.283
You were the one who was
too afraid to strip off.

08:17.283 --> 08:19.117
I wasn't afraid!

08:19.119 --> 08:21.920
I was just... Where was I
supposed to put my gun?

08:23.836 --> 08:25.038
Don't answer that.

08:26.055 --> 08:27.226
Come on, then.

08:30.932 --> 08:33.799
Sebastian! Hi.

08:33.801 --> 08:36.501
- Wow.
- No flirting.

08:36.503 --> 08:38.698
- Not a date.
- Fine.

08:38.700 --> 08:40.913
But have you seen the
other Naked Tigers yet?

08:40.914 --> 08:44.157
Let's just say there's plenty of food
and very little sun in their habitat.

08:44.158 --> 08:47.145
- Oh.
- Speaking of...

08:47.147 --> 08:48.414
(CLEARS THROAT)

08:50.081 --> 08:52.191
I think my security should lead the way.

08:52.192 --> 08:54.163
For protection, you know.

08:55.123 --> 08:57.389
- Run along.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.561
For what it's worth, you
really rock those stripes.

09:01.562 --> 09:03.929
A tiger is always in season, Sebastian.

09:03.931 --> 09:05.528
Rarr!

09:22.273 --> 09:23.649
How was Paris?

09:23.650 --> 09:25.350
None of your business.

09:25.351 --> 09:28.553
True, but it is your Lord
Chamberlain's business.

09:28.554 --> 09:30.255
I was concerned. I thought...

09:33.061 --> 09:36.446
- Well, as long as Your Majesty's okay.
- I'm fine.

09:39.768 --> 09:41.600
Very well. I'll be just outside.

09:49.503 --> 09:52.113
Just let me know if you need
a break, Your Highness.

09:52.114 --> 09:56.182
I trained in special ops, so
this is nothing for me, OK?

09:56.984 --> 09:58.551

10:12.700 --> 10:16.235

basically an airbrushed spectacle.

10:16.235 --> 10:17.870
I'm always a spectacle.

10:19.616 --> 10:22.192
- Thanks for the T-shirt.
- You're welcome.

10:22.543 --> 10:26.111
Don't ask where I was keeping
the money. Or my phone.

10:26.113 --> 10:27.645
Ohh! (GIGGLES)

10:32.244 --> 10:33.985
How are you doing with the break-up?

10:36.624 --> 10:38.389
Comes and goes.

10:40.936 --> 10:42.184
You know...

10:42.186 --> 10:46.665
I just keep thinking to myself
how quickly everything changed,

10:46.667 --> 10:48.701
how sudden it all was.

10:50.490 --> 10:53.144
I know something happened. I
just don't know what it was.

10:54.375 --> 10:56.360
So maybe it's something you can fix.

10:57.443 --> 10:58.697
Maybe.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.054
There's been so much drama between us,

11:04.684 --> 11:08.053
I don't know... I guess
at a certain point

11:08.054 --> 11:11.590
you have to ask yourself if
your worlds are better apart.

11:14.234 --> 11:16.100
You know what might make it better?

11:16.730 --> 11:18.798

- Food.

11:18.798 --> 11:20.866
This tiger's starving. Come on.

11:20.868 --> 11:22.433
Okay.

11:24.205 --> 11:27.655
There's your crystal, the blood...

11:29.405 --> 11:32.260
and a representation
of my heart's desire.

11:34.816 --> 11:36.950
Very nice.

11:39.126 --> 11:41.019
This is gonna cost you
more than last time.

11:45.259 --> 11:47.845
Which predator sacrificed this blood?

11:47.846 --> 11:50.730
The most powerful predator of all,

11:50.730 --> 11:53.065
- the King of England.
- Unacceptable.

11:53.066 --> 11:54.990
- No refunds.
- Same. Good luck.

11:54.991 --> 11:56.561
Not so fast.

11:57.936 --> 11:59.878
Look, I tried to get hold of a tiger,

11:59.879 --> 12:02.919
but apparently they don't exist anymore.

12:03.504 --> 12:07.677
What about a fox? Cunning, sly, sneaky.

12:07.678 --> 12:09.849
I suppose a fox would do.

12:09.850 --> 12:12.784
Done. Whatever it takes
to beat this cancer

12:12.785 --> 12:14.253
and keep my crown from...

12:14.254 --> 12:15.535
Robert.

12:16.456 --> 12:17.355
Hey.

12:18.269 --> 12:20.200
I owe you an apology.

12:21.355 --> 12:23.696
About the fight, the way I behaved.

12:23.697 --> 12:26.865
It's adrenalin left over from the
ring. It's done and forgotten.

12:26.865 --> 12:28.533
It's not just that.

12:30.270 --> 12:31.774
When you were gone,

12:33.206 --> 12:36.542
I finally found some
direction and meaning and...

12:39.046 --> 12:41.086
It's been a struggle giving that up.

12:42.212 --> 12:44.320
What, you want to be like me?

12:44.321 --> 12:47.886
I can't blame you. I mean,
look at me. I'm amazing.

12:49.090 --> 12:51.123
Liam, I get it. I truly do.

12:51.124 --> 12:54.793
And let's talk about how we can make
things better for you when I get back.

12:54.794 --> 12:58.297
Right now, I'm off to
see Kathryn. Come here.

12:59.667 --> 13:02.735
You're my brother, and I love you.

13:02.735 --> 13:06.289
I always will, no matter what.

13:08.832 --> 13:10.095
Hm!

13:10.096 --> 13:11.293
(LAUGHS)

13:11.293 --> 13:12.912
Pardon the interruption, Your Majesty,

13:12.913 --> 13:15.248
but your evening's schedule
has been arranged.

13:15.249 --> 13:17.582
Oh, right. Cancel it.

13:22.837 --> 13:25.437
Might I inquire why, Your Majesty?

13:27.504 --> 13:28.895
You might not.

13:31.363 --> 13:34.274
- Very well.
- Is there something you'd like to say?

13:37.138 --> 13:39.871
With all due respect, Your
Majesty, most of my day

13:39.873 --> 13:43.209
has been spent covering for you
regarding your appearance in Paris.

13:43.210 --> 13:46.501
If I'm gonna lie for you, the
least you can do is loop me in.

13:47.393 --> 13:50.493
No, the least I can do is employ you.

13:51.913 --> 13:53.519
It's been a difficult
year, Mr. Hoenigsberg.

13:53.519 --> 13:56.889
This morning, for the first
time in a long time,

13:57.628 --> 13:59.169
I had a great day.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.826
I won't apologize for it.

14:00.826 --> 14:03.195
Selfishly, I thought perhaps

14:03.196 --> 14:06.499
Her Majesty had experienced a
couple of good days with me.

14:06.500 --> 14:11.971
I refuse to walk on eggshells in
my own palace, Mr. Hoenigsberg.

14:11.971 --> 14:14.313
If you can't accept that,

14:14.315 --> 14:18.543
you need to think long and hard
about your place in this monarchy.

14:23.294 --> 14:24.316
Ma'am.

14:31.284 --> 14:33.284
Oh my God, look how cute he is.

14:35.956 --> 14:37.756
Leave it with me.

14:39.128 --> 14:42.547
- So we can play with it?
- No, so I can kill it.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.730
Its blood is gonna save my life.

14:44.731 --> 14:48.755
No! No, no... Please don't hurt it!

14:50.105 --> 14:52.893
(CYRUS YELLS, CLATTERING)

14:56.013 --> 14:58.778
It bit me like it was
some kind of wild animal.

15:00.115 --> 15:03.116
- Your Majesty...
- You'd better find it, Hill.

15:03.118 --> 15:05.184
Hunt that monster down. It's a menace.

15:05.186 --> 15:06.986
It's adorable.

15:06.988 --> 15:11.630
- I-I'm sorry... what is it?
- A fox.

15:11.631 --> 15:14.727
It attacked me while I was
minding my own business.

15:15.163 --> 15:17.033
Probably has rabies.

15:18.235 --> 15:23.003
- So where exactly is this fox now?
- How the hell would I know?

15:23.004 --> 15:27.607
- It ran through my secret door.
- So there's a fox loose in the palace?

15:27.609 --> 15:30.510
Oh, it's a little one. It's
a cute little baby one.

15:30.511 --> 15:32.936
It's a vicious killer.

15:33.836 --> 15:34.955
Very well.

15:44.459 --> 15:45.707
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

15:46.249 --> 15:49.184
Go away. Unless you're from the palace.

15:49.186 --> 15:51.451
Um... I am.

15:55.336 --> 15:58.004
Hi. Is Kathryn here?

15:58.005 --> 16:01.008
No. Are you really from the palace?

16:01.009 --> 16:02.808
Yes. I was just...

16:04.645 --> 16:06.480
just, um...

16:09.650 --> 16:11.652
Do you live here?

16:11.653 --> 16:13.519
No, I'm just her sister Angie.

16:13.519 --> 16:16.898
I do come here, eat her food,
steal her clothes and things.

16:17.602 --> 16:18.918
Right. Um...

16:20.240 --> 16:22.761
I handle social media for the family.

16:23.463 --> 16:26.198
Um... I'll stop by another time.

16:27.001 --> 16:30.703
Is Kathryn gonna be famous?
Make sure you mention me!

16:39.014 --> 16:41.129
- Kathryn?
- (GASPS)

16:41.130 --> 16:44.440
Oh my gosh! It's you!
I can't believe it!

16:44.441 --> 16:48.471
- Can we have a picture, please?
- Um... okay.

16:48.472 --> 16:50.724
Oh, my mates are gonna be so jealous!

16:50.725 --> 16:53.092
We all loved that dress you
wore to the People's Gala.

16:53.094 --> 16:55.144
What's he like, Prince Robert?

16:55.144 --> 16:56.893
Is he as nice as he seems?

16:57.413 --> 16:59.832
- He's okay.
- (GASPS)

17:00.668 --> 17:02.446
Shall we have a picture together?

17:08.376 --> 17:10.108
Okay. Smile.

17:11.012 --> 17:13.480
One more for luck. There we go.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.048
Thank you!

17:16.050 --> 17:18.151
How are you doing? Nice to meet you.

17:18.152 --> 17:19.919
- Hi.
- Hello.

17:24.226 --> 17:26.791
- For two, please.
- I'm afraid we're booked up.

17:26.794 --> 17:30.631
- Oh, I...
- Could you check again?

17:30.632 --> 17:32.266
I see a nice table right over there.

17:32.267 --> 17:34.166
That table is available,

17:34.167 --> 17:36.502
simply not available
to the likes of you.

17:37.372 --> 17:40.906
- Sorry? The "likes" of us?
- Let me just make a call.

17:54.476 --> 17:55.712
You like it?

17:56.597 --> 17:58.894
- Er... the truth?
- Mm-hm.

17:58.894 --> 18:01.340
Not at all. I thought we
were meeting for tea.

18:01.342 --> 18:03.805
We are. Come on.

18:11.272 --> 18:12.666
What's happening?

18:12.667 --> 18:15.161
There's been a change of ownership.

18:17.788 --> 18:19.801
Did you just buy this restaurant?

18:19.803 --> 18:23.095
Yes. We make an amazing beet
salad. You're gonna love it.

18:24.788 --> 18:27.953
Ah. Clarence. I'm gonna
need your jacket.

18:27.954 --> 18:29.695
Right away, sir.

18:29.696 --> 18:32.832
- Chop chop.

18:37.849 --> 18:40.395
- Not bad, for the likes of us.
- (LAUGHS)

18:53.682 --> 18:57.150
The toughest table in
town. But I know a guy.

18:57.853 --> 19:01.105
Once again, a spectacular view.

19:01.106 --> 19:04.714
Trust me. If we're comparing
views, mine wins every time.

19:25.125 --> 19:26.959
That was crazy today, wasn't it?

19:26.960 --> 19:28.438
Those girls recognized me.

19:28.439 --> 19:30.357
You'd better get used to that.

19:30.358 --> 19:31.911
I don't know that I would.

19:32.563 --> 19:36.332
Come on. Be honest. Part of
you enjoyed being recognized.

19:39.403 --> 19:41.171
What are you thinking about?

19:41.172 --> 19:46.439
The crown. Cyrus won't go easily.
The public were intrigued by Liam.

19:47.144 --> 19:49.612
I don't know. Maybe I
should just walk away,

19:49.613 --> 19:51.614
let the two of them fight over it.

19:52.317 --> 19:56.018
And that would make you
happy? Or at least, happier?

from the scrutiny and noise,

20:01.832 --> 20:04.200

growing old together.

20:04.201 --> 20:05.955
I could do worse.

20:07.464 --> 20:08.962
Could you do better?

20:10.898 --> 20:12.602
Depends who I'm growing old with.

20:20.766 --> 20:22.976
I've been thinking about
how you styled the gala.

20:22.977 --> 20:24.279
It was really impressive.

20:24.280 --> 20:27.517
Thank you. Like I said, it
was a welcome distraction.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.586
You ever think about
making it more than that,

20:29.586 --> 20:31.186

20:39.529 --> 20:41.431
about my purchase and our lunch.

- May have leaked? Did leak?
- Did leak.

I'm dressed for it.

to cover that tiger pelt,

still have that haircut, Frost.

- You two know each other?
- Yeah. We're old friends.

- I can see that.
- This is Brandon Boone.

knowing you aren't wearing a wire.

- I'm not wearing a wire.
- I'll be the judge of that.

23:01.330 --> 23:02.904

accept any version of me.

24:37.892 --> 24:39.162
Yeah, and I meant it, then.

24:39.163 --> 24:42.137
Then mean it now, for God's
sake. I need you here.

- You have Jack.
- You're my friend.

not sure I have any at all.

- Just get back to work.

- I don't think I will now.
- You would if you care about me.

twist things and push people away.

- Said the queen with no friends.

she's missed me too, which is nice.

25:47.387 --> 25:48.884
I'm sure she did.

25:49.917 --> 25:52.393
Listen, I've been thinking
about what you said,

25:53.176 --> 25:56.444
and I think I owe you an apology.

25:57.042 --> 25:58.548
I hadn't really considered
what you'd gained,

25:58.548 --> 26:00.482
and had to give up when I came home.

26:01.161 --> 26:02.701
That wasn't very fair on you.

26:03.461 --> 26:06.796
And it shouldn't be about
who was born first.

26:06.797 --> 26:09.191
It should be about who would
make the best monarch...

26:09.955 --> 26:12.060
for the family, and for the people.

26:13.260 --> 26:15.309
And we both know that's not Cyrus.

26:16.741 --> 26:18.584
But maybe it's not me, either.

26:19.614 --> 26:20.790
Maybe it's you.

26:24.748 --> 26:26.280
So what should we do?

26:27.345 --> 26:29.679
Well, Mum was about to
prove your paternity,

26:29.680 --> 26:32.448
- presumably to place you on the throne.
- That's right.

26:32.449 --> 26:34.416
Then we should go and speak with her.

26:34.417 --> 26:37.019
You should tell her exactly
how you're feeling,

26:37.907 --> 26:40.211
and if she agrees with you,

26:40.211 --> 26:43.086
if she truly believes
that this is your time,

26:44.228 --> 26:45.660
then I'll support that.

26:46.449 --> 26:47.915
I'll stand behind you.

26:51.736 --> 26:54.336
- You could do that?
- For you?

26:54.337 --> 26:56.181
Of course I could.

26:57.197 --> 26:58.740
No matter what, okay?

27:00.201 --> 27:01.175
Okay.

Right.

- It's true.

27:20.548 --> 27:22.590
It means nothing without proof.

27:22.592 --> 27:24.025
I'll get you proof.

- How?

Yeah. Princess.
