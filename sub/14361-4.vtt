00:09.805 --> 00:12.176

00:13.598 --> 00:14.665

00:14.836 --> 00:16.170
<i>well, everything.</i>

00:17.767 --> 00:19.004
<i>Hi.</i>

00:19.117 --> 00:20.885
<i>What are you guys doing here?</i>

00:22.289 --> 00:24.421
<i>- And you are...</i>
<i>- Sue.</i>

00:25.094 --> 00:26.163
<i>Axl's sister.</i>

00:26.262 --> 00:27.323
<i>I don't think so.</i>

00:27.364 --> 00:29.364
<i>No, no. I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>he doesn't have a sister.</i>

00:29.476 --> 00:31.036
<i>He doesn't have a sister, right, Court?</i>

00:31.136 --> 00:32.296
<i>No, he has a brother, though.</i>

00:32.296 --> 00:34.055
<i>He's cute.</i>
<i>You should meet him...</i>

00:34.155 --> 00:38.377
<i>I have met him, because he's</i>
<i>my brother, as is Axl.</i>

00:39.132 --> 00:40.392
<i>One sec.</i>

00:42.363 --> 00:43.584
<i>Why are you talking to them?</i>

00:43.696 --> 00:45.346
<i>They don't know I'm your sister.</i>

00:45.465 --> 00:47.345
<i>And I'm working very hard</i>
<i>to keep it that way.</i>

00:47.377 --> 00:49.412
<i>They're cheerleaders, and you're...</i>

00:51.102 --> 00:52.794
<i>whatever this is.</i>
<i>Now leave.</i>

00:52.939 --> 00:54.059
<i>You're Sue-ing up the place.</i>

00:54.060 --> 00:54.558
<i>No.</i>

00:54.651 --> 00:57.130
<i>This is my house, too, Axl, and</i>
<i>I can go wherever I want.</i>

01:01.277 --> 01:02.151
<i>My god.</i>

01:02.259 --> 01:04.659
<i>It's my senior year, and I just</i>
<i>started dating a hot blonde</i>

01:04.660 --> 01:06.980
<i>cheerleader, and now Sue's out</i>
<i>There saying she knows me.</i>

01:07.084 --> 01:08.029
<i>So?</i>

01:08.125 --> 01:09.627
<i>What do you want me to do about it?</i>

01:09.739 --> 01:11.499
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>How about a little parenting?</i>

01:11.602 --> 01:13.682
<i>Like locking her in the</i>
<i>basement, or sending her to</i>

01:13.683 --> 01:16.173
<i>some bible camp to pray the dork away!</i>

01:16.346 --> 01:18.466
<i>Look, it's enough that I</i>
<i>said I'd stay in here while</i>

01:18.467 --> 01:19.347
<i>your friends are over.</i>

01:19.456 --> 01:20.816
<i>I'm not gonna make Sue do it, too.</i>

01:20.829 --> 01:22.183
<i>One of us is gonna be out there.</i>

01:22.293 --> 01:23.814
<i>Pick one.</i>
<i>Me or Sue?</i>

01:24.371 --> 01:26.467
<i>Forget it.</i>
<i>We're going to a movie.</i>

01:29.786 --> 01:30.865
<i>Axl, you should know,</i>

01:31.014 --> 01:33.729
<i>there's a sad girl who's lost</i>
<i>in your house.</i>

01:34.135 --> 01:35.415
<i>Hey, mom, I wanted to</i>

01:35.518 --> 01:37.819
<i>talk to you about what I'm gonna</i>
<i>try out for this fall.</i>

01:39.952 --> 01:42.577
<i>I was thinking I shouldn't</i>
<i>try out for anything.</i>

01:42.682 --> 01:45.281
<i>Maybe I should just save myself</i>
<i>for wrestlerettes.</i>

01:45.392 --> 01:46.768
<i>Thank god...</i>

01:47.279 --> 01:49.593
<i>that you're gonna be spending</i>
<i>more time with us.</i>

01:49.741 --> 01:50.498
<i>Yay!</i>

01:50.604 --> 01:53.394
<i>But don't worry. I am not</i>
<i>just going to squander my time.</i>

01:53.501 --> 01:56.736
<i>I am going to use it to try</i>
<i>to learn a cartwheel.</i>

02:01.262 --> 02:02.116
<i>Okay.</i>

02:07.807 --> 02:10.386
<i>Well, I have good news and bad news.</i>

02:10.494 --> 02:12.213
It's never good news-good news, is it?

02:12.337 --> 02:13.111
Never here.

02:13.238 --> 02:16.194
Sue has decided not to try out
for anything this fall.

02:16.322 --> 02:18.335
Hey. She's finally given up.
That is good news.

02:18.468 --> 02:19.715
The bad news is,

02:19.824 --> 02:21.936
I got an e-mail
from Ms. Tompkins,

02:22.249 --> 02:23.903
Brick's social skills teacher?

02:24.288 --> 02:26.314
I guess she wants to meet with us.

02:26.447 --> 02:27.527
Again?

02:27.643 --> 02:28.923
When is that woman gonna realize

02:28.924 --> 02:30.371
she's underpaid, and check out?

02:30.481 --> 02:32.439
- What is it this time?
- Could be anything.

02:32.749 --> 02:34.742
Although, you know what,
when I think about it,

02:34.845 --> 02:36.709
lately, he hasn't been that bad.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.274
When's the last time he whispered?

02:38.402 --> 02:39.754
Three weeks, right?

02:39.891 --> 02:42.417
Wait. Maybe she's
calling us in to tell us

02:42.543 --> 02:44.166
he's moving up to the yellow group.

02:44.291 --> 02:47.022
Hey. Good news-good news.
High five.

02:50.182 --> 02:53.525
So... I'm guessing you know
why you're here.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.962
We think we have a pretty good idea.

02:56.127 --> 02:57.829
Right. It's about Brick's tic.

02:58.062 --> 02:59.241
Yep. Three weeks.

02:59.431 --> 03:01.350
I know. That's why
I'm so concerned.

03:02.342 --> 03:05.407
You're concerned he hasn't
whispered in three weeks?

03:05.567 --> 03:07.717
No. I'm not talking
about the whispering,

03:07.838 --> 03:11.217
I'm talking about the new tic.
I'm sure you two have noticed.

03:13.770 --> 03:15.274
Whoop.

03:16.823 --> 03:18.046
Whoop.

03:19.757 --> 03:21.897
I don't think we've ever
changed the batteries.

03:22.397 --> 03:23.342
Whoop.

03:26.754 --> 03:28.160
So no yellow group, then?

03:28.273 --> 03:30.383
God, no.
See, with the new tic,

03:30.553 --> 03:34.562
Brick's issues have moved
out of my area of expertise,

03:34.692 --> 03:36.945
so I'm wondering how you'd <i>feel</i>

03:37.068 --> 03:40.933
if I looped in my colleague,
the school therapist.

03:41.041 --> 03:42.113
A therapist?

03:42.236 --> 03:43.796
- I don't know about...
- Fortunately,

03:43.797 --> 03:46.711
Dr. Fulton just happened
to be free this period.

03:48.785 --> 03:50.697
Hi. Chuck Fulton.

03:50.894 --> 03:53.815
Wow. She said your name,
and here you are,

03:53.970 --> 03:55.672
almost as if you'd been waiting.

03:56.212 --> 03:57.603
- Frankie Heck.
- Hi.

03:57.713 --> 03:59.398
- Mike Heck.
- Hi.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.194
Hey, guys,

04:01.428 --> 04:03.777
I've taken the opportunity
over this past week

04:03.899 --> 04:06.006
to observe your Brick in the classroom,

04:06.150 --> 04:08.220
and I concur that he shows some reluctance

04:08.329 --> 04:10.261
in engaging with his peers.

04:10.366 --> 04:11.552
They'll try to talk to him,

04:11.656 --> 04:13.333
and he just sort of wanders away.

04:13.432 --> 04:15.616
Ever talk to kids his age?
Not that interesting.

04:15.742 --> 04:17.349
- Mike.
- And the whooping.

04:17.452 --> 04:18.848
Yeah, that...

04:18.940 --> 04:20.310
That's a fresh one, even for me.

04:20.438 --> 04:23.932
Now he could be whooping
for any number of reasons.

04:24.043 --> 04:26.755
I mean, it could be the sign
of a serious mental illness...

04:27.135 --> 04:29.436
or something simple.

04:29.555 --> 04:31.096
We just don't know.

04:31.398 --> 04:32.851
But my gut is telling me

04:32.971 --> 04:35.938
that what we're dealing with
here is an attachment disorder.

04:36.913 --> 04:39.088
You're elevating his quirk
to a disorder now?

04:39.201 --> 04:40.675
No worries, mom and dad.

04:40.855 --> 04:43.220
We've got a lot of weapons in our arsenal

04:43.327 --> 04:44.490
to try and treat this.

04:44.607 --> 04:46.783
Drugs? You wanna put him
on drugs?

04:48.535 --> 04:49.606
Easy, mom.

04:49.699 --> 04:52.432
We're not allowed
to go there first anymore.

04:52.705 --> 04:54.007
No, I think we can start Brick

04:54.117 --> 04:56.460
with something as simple as a pet.

04:56.609 --> 04:57.551
A pet?

04:57.663 --> 04:59.762
No. He kills pets.

05:01.057 --> 05:03.927
But not on purpose.
Mostly accidental.

05:04.078 --> 05:06.008
It's neglect, really.

05:06.108 --> 05:07.993
And he feels bad.
I mean, he doesn't cry.

05:08.163 --> 05:09.857
Not like a serial killer.

05:09.993 --> 05:11.507
I know they don't cry, either.

05:11.634 --> 05:13.514
They don't have any empathy
for their victims.

05:13.515 --> 05:14.608
Like Brick, but he...

05:15.235 --> 05:16.986
Okay. That's noted.

05:17.378 --> 05:20.053
The basic idea is that he learns
to bond with the pet,

05:20.176 --> 05:22.444
and then he learns to bond with people.

05:22.905 --> 05:25.226
It's all part of a multipronged approach.

05:25.787 --> 05:28.633
Sounds expensive.
How many prongs we talking here?

05:28.752 --> 05:30.832
Well, we were thinking
to supplement the great work

05:30.833 --> 05:32.178
that Laura's doing here

05:32.304 --> 05:34.548
with some biweekly sessions with me.

05:34.731 --> 05:36.767
I could conduct the sessions
on the playground,

05:36.987 --> 05:39.059
over a game of hacky sack.

05:39.175 --> 05:42.242
Look, I appreciate everyone's concerns,

05:42.355 --> 05:45.496
but we're not the kind of family
that needs therapy.

05:50.408 --> 05:52.028
Quick. Close the door.

05:53.152 --> 05:55.212
The most amazing thing happened today.

05:55.341 --> 05:56.701
The mascot for the Thundering Hens

05:56.832 --> 05:58.082
got juvenile shingles,

05:58.205 --> 06:00.730
so now they're holding tryouts
for a new mascot!

06:00.907 --> 06:01.976
Ha ha!

06:02.347 --> 06:03.593
Well, it just goes to show ya,

06:03.723 --> 06:05.633
sometimes when God shuts a door,

06:05.840 --> 06:07.326
he opens a window.

06:07.458 --> 06:10.483
And sometimes God just wants you
to do nothing for a while.

06:10.613 --> 06:12.937
I have to practice everything
with this box on my head

06:13.069 --> 06:14.934
until it all seems normal.

06:15.048 --> 06:16.390
Yes! Thank you!

06:16.547 --> 06:18.380
Finally made Sue wear a box on her head.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.041
I've been pushing this for years!

06:20.654 --> 06:22.422
Shut up, Axl!

06:24.250 --> 06:25.284
Whoop.

06:26.882 --> 06:29.106
You don't think Brick
needs a therapist, do you?

06:29.186 --> 06:30.306
I mean, sure, we didn't jump

06:30.307 --> 06:31.707
on the whispering thing right away,

06:31.708 --> 06:33.668
but I think we can get out
in front of this one.

06:33.669 --> 06:35.095
It's only his second tic.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.753
You're forgetting the ketchup packets.

06:36.849 --> 06:39.225
Ketchup packets were a phase, not a tic.

06:41.517 --> 06:42.930
Nobody help me.

06:43.046 --> 06:44.668
I need to learn to get up on my own.

06:47.446 --> 06:49.566
So... we hanging out
after school?

06:49.793 --> 06:51.033
Can you do after school, Court?

06:51.045 --> 06:53.230
I can do after school.
We'll be there.

06:58.273 --> 06:59.833
Every time I try to get Courtney alone,

06:59.896 --> 07:01.387
Debbie is always there.

07:01.590 --> 07:03.190
Wait. I thought
you were dating Debbie.

07:03.389 --> 07:05.180
What?
No, I'm dating Courtney.

07:05.518 --> 07:07.316
I don't think so.

07:07.594 --> 07:08.514
Why would you say that?

07:08.614 --> 07:10.854
'Cause everybody at school
thinks you're dating Debbie.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.797
Well, then, everybody at school is wrong.

07:12.969 --> 07:13.918
Are you sure?

07:14.030 --> 07:15.053
Yeah, Darrin.

07:15.150 --> 07:17.039
I think I know who I'm dating.
It's Courtney.

07:17.526 --> 07:21.203
Man, it doesn't get much better than this.

07:21.336 --> 07:23.503
Chillin' out, watching "The Avengers,"

07:23.610 --> 07:25.493
dating the hottest girl in school.

07:25.730 --> 07:26.909
That's sweet.

07:27.020 --> 07:28.152
Isn't that sweet, Court?

07:28.269 --> 07:30.048
So sweet.
Isn't he the best?

07:30.150 --> 07:32.813
He is. I don't think there's
ever been a better boyfriend.

07:32.924 --> 07:34.313
Never a better boyfriend.

07:34.878 --> 07:36.778
I have no idea who I'm dating.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here

07:46.289 --> 07:48.369
What do you mean, you don't
know who you're dating?

07:48.453 --> 07:49.418
I don't know, okay?

07:49.520 --> 07:51.440
They were both acting
like they were dating me.

07:51.441 --> 07:52.072
It was weird.

07:52.207 --> 07:53.181
Who'd you ask out?

07:53.281 --> 07:54.646
That would at least eliminate one.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.116
I thought I called Courtney,

07:56.117 --> 07:57.477
but maybe I called Debbie instead.

07:57.478 --> 07:58.593
I just don't know anymore!

07:58.708 --> 08:00.028
Come on. We can
figure this out.

08:00.029 --> 08:01.528
Which one seems to like you better?

08:02.378 --> 08:04.178
I can't tell 'cause they're
always together.

08:04.257 --> 08:05.820
I mean, I assume I'd go for the blonde,

08:05.953 --> 08:07.672
but Debbie's really been riding me lately,

08:07.782 --> 08:09.373
so maybe she's my girlfriend.

08:09.671 --> 08:11.271
Which one have you been making out with?

08:12.949 --> 08:15.207
My... God.

08:15.324 --> 08:17.157
Three weeks, you haven't even kissed one?

08:17.276 --> 08:18.356
Maybe you're dating Darrin.

08:18.454 --> 08:19.715
He could do worse.

08:19.882 --> 08:21.934
I'm kind, and I always show up on time.

08:22.062 --> 08:23.222
I haven't been making out yet

08:23.223 --> 08:25.383
'cause I'm never alone
with whoever it is I'm dating!

08:25.384 --> 08:27.501
Man, I gotta figure this out.

08:27.630 --> 08:28.670
Homecoming's this weekend.

08:28.781 --> 08:30.221
I can't afford to take both of them.

08:30.359 --> 08:32.547
Look, just ask the right questions,

08:32.666 --> 08:34.081
and the answer will reveal itself.

08:36.792 --> 08:37.730
All right.

08:37.832 --> 08:40.522
<i>So after agreeing we were</i>
<i>smarter than a therapist,</i>

08:40.681 --> 08:42.544
<i>Mike and I went about fixing Brick's tic</i>

08:42.659 --> 08:45.428
<i>in the way only loving parents can do.</i>

08:45.544 --> 08:46.341
Whoop.

08:46.432 --> 08:47.431
Knock it off.

08:47.579 --> 08:48.483
Whoop.

08:49.518 --> 08:50.481
Whoop.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.121
Whoop.

08:52.808 --> 08:53.435
Whoop.

08:53.548 --> 08:54.456
Stop it!

08:54.528 --> 08:55.928
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it,

08:55.929 --> 08:56.969
stop it, stop it, stop it!

08:58.533 --> 09:00.922
Look, Brick, we got you a bunny.

09:01.127 --> 09:02.301
Why?

09:03.229 --> 09:04.901
No reason.

09:05.192 --> 09:06.185
Whoop.

09:09.400 --> 09:12.505
My... God.
You got us a bunny?!

09:12.642 --> 09:16.608
I can't <i>believe</i> it!

09:16.731 --> 09:17.966
Whoo!

09:18.072 --> 09:20.008
- What are you doing?
- I'm practicing.

09:20.119 --> 09:23.030
As a mascot, I have to
exaggerate all of my movements.

09:23.192 --> 09:28.918
I just <i>love</i> him <i>so much.</i>

09:29.571 --> 09:31.371
I thought we were
getting something smaller.

09:31.372 --> 09:32.892
We were, but they were out of gerbils,

09:32.893 --> 09:34.053
and I didn't want to go back.

09:34.147 --> 09:36.147
Sue, get away from the bunny.
It's Brick's bunny.

09:36.171 --> 09:37.487
How come Brick gets a bunny?

09:37.663 --> 09:38.745
Because he's the youngest,

09:38.746 --> 09:40.546
and there are things
you got that he didn't,

09:40.660 --> 09:41.811
and now we've even.

09:41.970 --> 09:43.165
No, she can have it.

09:43.275 --> 09:46.039
Thank you so much, Brick.

09:46.172 --> 09:48.498
He is so cute!

09:48.613 --> 09:50.778
I just love him so, so much!

09:50.934 --> 09:52.390
I'm gonna name him "Bugs."

09:52.566 --> 09:54.427
No, you're not
naming it "Bugs."

09:54.567 --> 09:56.373
It's Brick's bunny.
He's gonna name him.

09:56.528 --> 09:57.543
"Bugs" is fine.

09:57.689 --> 09:59.406
Look! Look!
They got Brick a bunny.

09:59.547 --> 10:01.560
What? How come he gets
a bunny and I don't?

10:01.724 --> 10:03.401
'Cause Brick needs help and you don't,

10:03.507 --> 10:04.546
so Brick gets a bunny!

10:04.669 --> 10:06.363
So he does weird stuff and gets things?

10:06.489 --> 10:07.551
I can do weird stuff.

10:10.877 --> 10:11.799
Now get me a car.

10:13.963 --> 10:17.298
<i>So the next day,</i>
<i>Axl put his plan into action.</i>

10:18.569 --> 10:21.939
So, who am I dropping off first?

10:22.050 --> 10:23.571
You can just drop us both at my house.

10:23.682 --> 10:24.872
We're having a sleepover.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.378
<i>Of</i> course you are.

10:34.428 --> 10:37.028
Well, I guess if everyone's here
for the mascot tryouts,

10:37.144 --> 10:38.542
we'll get started.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.150
Put on the head.

10:46.285 --> 10:48.482
<i>There are those moments</i>
<i>in life when the stars align</i>

10:48.595 --> 10:50.894
<i>and everything just falls into place.</i>

10:51.043 --> 10:52.542
<i>And with nobody else trying out,</i>

10:52.643 --> 10:54.326
<i>this was one of those moments...</i>

10:56.027 --> 10:57.814
<i>If only Sue weren't Sue.</i>

10:57.937 --> 10:59.453
<i>Attention, students...</i>

10:59.629 --> 11:03.425
<i>because of low turnout, we are</i>
<i>extending mascot tryouts.</i>

11:03.669 --> 11:07.705
<i>Anyone is welcome.</i>
<i>Anyone. Anyone at all.</i>

11:07.812 --> 11:10.154
<i>Seriously. Anyone.</i>

11:11.920 --> 11:13.257
Brick, what are you doing?

11:13.371 --> 11:15.251
You're supposed to be
bonding with your bunny.

11:15.262 --> 11:16.667
There's something wrong with it.

11:16.785 --> 11:17.965
I think it has issues.

11:18.112 --> 11:18.877
Whoop.

11:18.980 --> 11:20.663
Come on. There's nothing
wrong with him.

11:20.776 --> 11:23.291
He's a sweet, soft, cuddly bunny.

11:24.084 --> 11:24.964
<i>He wasn't.</i>

11:34.950 --> 11:37.306
<i>At first, we thought the bunny</i>
<i>was just scared of us.</i>

11:37.499 --> 11:38.139
Now look, Brick,

11:38.140 --> 11:39.660
you just gotta learn how to handle it.

11:39.768 --> 11:41.052
Now you don't wanna startle him.

11:41.236 --> 11:42.538
Son of a...

11:42.637 --> 11:43.239
Whoop.

11:43.361 --> 11:45.264
<i>And then we thought maybe</i>
<i>he was just hungry.</i>

11:45.501 --> 11:47.101
Well, we know he doesn't like pop tarts,

11:47.193 --> 11:49.677
but he certainly has a taste
for human flesh.

11:51.004 --> 11:52.686
<i>It wasn't long before we realized</i>

11:52.812 --> 11:54.855
<i>the bunny wasn't scared of us.</i>

11:55.160 --> 11:56.695
<i>We were scared of him.</i>

11:56.816 --> 11:58.616
I am expecting
a super important phone call,

11:58.617 --> 11:59.855
so nobody use the phone.

11:59.990 --> 12:02.750
Because if nobody shows up
to try out by 5:00,

12:02.884 --> 12:06.196
I am the new Thundering Hen!

12:06.325 --> 12:07.359
My God, it's out.

12:07.479 --> 12:08.997
It's out of its cage!

12:12.019 --> 12:13.739
All right! All right!
Everybody stay calm!

12:13.740 --> 12:14.660
I'll take care of this.

12:14.661 --> 12:17.021
Brick, why is the bunny loose?
It was your responsibility!

12:17.022 --> 12:18.831
I think you just answered
your own question.

12:18.945 --> 12:20.706
I see it!

12:26.344 --> 12:28.189
There he goes!

12:28.324 --> 12:29.248
Sucker's fast!

12:30.296 --> 12:32.388
My God!
No! That's for me!

12:32.497 --> 12:33.656
That's the mascot call!

12:33.767 --> 12:36.111
Axl, go over there and throw me the phone!

12:36.195 --> 12:38.290
No way! I'm a football player!
I need my legs!

12:38.392 --> 12:39.609
Wha... ugh!

12:39.717 --> 12:41.807
I see him! Right there!
Right there! Right there!

12:41.968 --> 12:42.916
Ha!

12:43.901 --> 12:46.181
Got him cornered! Give me
something to pick him up with!

12:46.460 --> 12:47.689
Here, here, here, here, here.

12:50.193 --> 12:52.537
Damn it! Stay still,
you little rodent!

12:52.640 --> 12:54.368
Dad, a rabbit is technically a mammal.

12:54.473 --> 12:55.365
Not now, Brick.

12:55.490 --> 12:57.793
- Get it! Get it!
- What do you think I'm trying to do?

12:57.957 --> 12:59.611
I'm coming! I'm coming!

12:59.729 --> 13:01.532
Don't hang up!

13:08.238 --> 13:09.343
Hello?

13:09.445 --> 13:11.045
Okay, that's it.
That's it right there.

13:11.046 --> 13:12.251
Just grab it!
Just grab it!

13:12.397 --> 13:13.240
You wanna do this?

13:14.114 --> 13:16.873
I got it!
I'm the Thundering Hen!

13:17.146 --> 13:19.547
I got him!
I got the little bastard.

13:19.690 --> 13:20.720
Yay.

13:26.683 --> 13:28.163
If you'd have just gotten a goldfish,

13:28.250 --> 13:29.237
he'd be dead already.

13:33.255 --> 13:34.014
Hey.

13:34.175 --> 13:34.895
So I was thinking,

13:34.925 --> 13:37.355
homecoming dance might be
more fun if we double dated.

13:37.634 --> 13:39.882
Wow, that would be fun.
Wouldn't it, Deb?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.865
Totally. Sounds good
to me, Court.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.615
Sweet. Now you wouldn't happen
to know of anyone

13:44.722 --> 13:46.323
who might wanna go with my friend?

13:46.452 --> 13:47.785
He is really cool.

13:48.163 --> 13:50.844
I might know a certain cheerleader...

13:50.962 --> 13:53.721
who would <i>love</i> to go with him.

13:55.386 --> 13:57.292
Sarah, we found you a date!

13:58.519 --> 14:00.479
You're going to
the homecoming dance with Sarah.

14:00.704 --> 14:02.225
Bottom-of-the-pyramid
Sarah?

14:02.398 --> 14:03.459
Had to be done.

14:03.629 --> 14:06.961
Just another casualty
in this crazy game I'm playing.

14:10.776 --> 14:12.244
<i>Once the bunny was in the bathroom,</i>

14:13.082 --> 14:14.393
<i>he stayed there.</i>

14:14.955 --> 14:16.655
<i>Kind of like Mike on a Sunday.</i>

14:23.851 --> 14:25.953
Occupied.

14:31.700 --> 14:32.866
Okay. This is enough.

14:33.005 --> 14:34.845
I need to know that
I can go into my bathroom

14:34.953 --> 14:36.990
without hot cheerleaders being in there.

14:37.593 --> 14:38.791
Yes, I'm that old.

14:39.321 --> 14:40.582
Bugs has gotta go.

14:40.695 --> 14:43.225
We can't. The stupid thing
has gotta bond with Brick.

14:43.796 --> 14:45.306
Brick barely bonded with me.

14:45.419 --> 14:47.321
He's not bonding with psycho bunny.

14:47.458 --> 14:49.720
Dr. Fulton says if he can
learn to relate to the bunny,

14:49.830 --> 14:51.234
he can learn to relate to people.

14:51.757 --> 14:52.957
Why are we making him do this?

14:53.022 --> 14:54.472
What's so great about people?

14:54.591 --> 14:56.744
Because Brick needs
to learn how to attach.

14:56.857 --> 14:58.833
Why? All he wants to do
is read.

14:58.948 --> 15:01.148
That's not true. Brick wants
to feel a part of things.

15:01.149 --> 15:01.989
Brick wants to whoop,

15:01.990 --> 15:03.261
read a book, and be left alone.

15:03.369 --> 15:05.319
I'm his mom. I think
I know what Brick wants.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.786
How do you know what Brick
wants? Have you ever asked him?

15:09.079 --> 15:13.328
No.
No, I have not. Wow.

15:13.542 --> 15:16.595
We never talk to Brick
about... anything.

15:17.308 --> 15:19.183
Maybe we should talk to him.

15:19.289 --> 15:20.216
Maybe we should.

15:20.327 --> 15:22.087
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen?

15:22.164 --> 15:23.151
He gets another tic?

15:23.429 --> 15:25.006
It's not like we'd notice it, anyway.

15:25.121 --> 15:25.898
Yeah.

15:26.484 --> 15:28.500
<i>Attention all students...</i>

15:28.668 --> 15:30.352
<i>will Axl Heck's girlfriend</i>

15:30.479 --> 15:32.045
<i>please report to the main office.</i>

15:32.166 --> 15:33.061
<i>ASAP...</i>

15:33.159 --> 15:34.322
<i>or sooner.</i>

15:35.528 --> 15:37.379
I got your message, Axl.

15:37.542 --> 15:40.188
A crow outside my window said
you would contact me today.

15:40.401 --> 15:42.240
Are we going to homecoming?

15:42.347 --> 15:43.925
- No!
- Okay.

15:44.304 --> 15:45.560
See you at prom.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.037
So, Brick, as parents,

15:54.160 --> 15:57.179
your dad and I often talk
about what's best for you.

15:57.347 --> 16:01.319
But we realize we don't always
include you in these talks.

16:02.254 --> 16:03.844
I appreciate your candor.

16:03.989 --> 16:05.713
I think I'm mature enough to be involved.

16:05.838 --> 16:06.990
Whoop.

16:08.362 --> 16:10.219
So I'm just gonna lay it out for you.

16:10.333 --> 16:11.242
Here goes.

16:11.647 --> 16:15.309
I don't think it's a secret
that you are unique,

16:15.444 --> 16:17.267
and we want you to stay unique.

16:17.408 --> 16:19.760
But not so unique that you get labeled

16:19.875 --> 16:21.753
as... too unique.

16:21.883 --> 16:24.126
I think what we're trying
to figure out is,

16:24.321 --> 16:27.656
why do <i>you</i> think you have
trouble connecting with people?

16:27.781 --> 16:30.421
That's an interesting question.

16:30.620 --> 16:31.944
Well, I don't know.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.079
Could be 'cause you brought home
the wrong baby

16:34.196 --> 16:35.747
and I was nursed by a strange woman.

16:35.851 --> 16:37.226
I mean, that might leave a scar.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.582
Well, Brick, you were a baby.

16:39.711 --> 16:41.711
- There's no way you could remember that.
- Yeah.

16:41.712 --> 16:43.360
- Yeah.
- That's true.

16:43.626 --> 16:45.332
Well, maybe it's 'cause you guys

16:45.459 --> 16:47.316
don't really spend any time with me.

16:48.027 --> 16:49.642
We're... busy.

16:50.029 --> 16:52.533
And yet not too busy to watch Dance Moms.

16:52.925 --> 16:54.911
Well, Brick, we're spending
time with you now,

16:55.039 --> 16:56.949
and you're still whooping, so...

16:57.269 --> 16:59.422
I don't know.
There's just so many things.

16:59.549 --> 17:01.395
We never really have any nutritious meals.

17:01.496 --> 17:02.547
That could be it.

17:02.670 --> 17:05.233
We don't have set bedtimes.
Kids need structure.

17:05.354 --> 17:06.873
We beg for stuff, and you cave.

17:06.969 --> 17:08.530
That doesn't establish boundaries.

17:09.506 --> 17:11.707
Look, the point is,
you do enough weird stuff.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.083
You don't need another one.

17:13.590 --> 17:14.902
Knock off the whooping.

17:15.340 --> 17:16.404
The whooping?

17:16.545 --> 17:17.585
That's what this is about?

17:17.693 --> 17:19.252
I thought it was about the other thing.

17:19.253 --> 17:20.361
The whispering?

17:20.550 --> 17:22.383
No. I have to say
the pledge of allegiance

17:22.507 --> 17:24.413
20 times before I go to bed.

17:24.790 --> 17:27.128
Pledge of allegiance.

17:28.194 --> 17:29.410
Awesome.

17:39.752 --> 17:41.467
<i>Sue had finally achieved her dream</i>

17:41.586 --> 17:43.409
<i>of becoming a Thundering Hen.</i>

17:43.605 --> 17:46.444
<i>And to say she was excited</i>
<i>was an understatement.</i>

17:48.474 --> 17:49.571
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

17:49.687 --> 17:51.912
<i>...give it up</i>
<i>for your Thundering Hens!</i>

17:52.038 --> 17:53.999
- Hey!
- Hey! There she is!

17:58.492 --> 17:59.997
God, I can't look.
Did she get up?

18:00.980 --> 18:02.126
Yep, she popped right up.

18:12.275 --> 18:15.294
- All right. There you go.
- That's the spirit. - All right!

18:17.210 --> 18:19.531
Wow! Good job, Sue!

18:22.679 --> 18:23.444
<i>It's 4th and goal</i>

18:23.551 --> 18:25.005
<i>with 3 seconds left on the clock.</i>

18:25.112 --> 18:27.132
<i>The Hens gotta go</i>
<i>for the touchdown to win!</i>

18:35.673 --> 18:37.465
<i>This was it. The final play.</i>

18:37.706 --> 18:39.553
<i>You could hear a pin drop.</i>

18:39.690 --> 18:41.038
<i>Until...</i>

18:41.141 --> 18:42.069
Whoop.

18:42.156 --> 18:43.636
Hey, you guys wanna shut your kid up?

18:43.745 --> 18:45.825
He's been doing that
the whole game. It's annoying.

18:52.745 --> 18:54.052
Whoop!

18:54.644 --> 18:56.382
What? That's how we cheer.

18:56.482 --> 18:58.865
It's just a family thing.
It's not weird. Whoop!

19:00.566 --> 19:01.733
Whoop!

19:02.064 --> 19:03.075
Whoop!

19:03.288 --> 19:03.838
Whoop!

19:04.525 --> 19:06.131
- Whoop!
- Whoop, whoop!

19:06.297 --> 19:06.892
Whoop!

19:07.052 --> 19:08.052
- Whoop!
- Whoop, whoop!

19:08.053 --> 19:09.080
Whoop!

19:09.357 --> 19:10.030
Hike!

19:16.834 --> 19:17.814
<i>And...</i>

19:17.911 --> 19:18.874
<i>he's in there!</i>

19:18.988 --> 19:21.733
<i>Axl Heck has scored the winning touchdown!</i>

19:21.842 --> 19:24.161
<i>The Hens have pulled off a squeaker!</i>

19:24.287 --> 19:25.767
<i>What a great game!</i>

19:27.384 --> 19:28.697
There you go.

19:30.247 --> 19:32.251
<i>It was a great moment for Axl</i>

19:32.917 --> 19:35.450
<i>and an even greater moment for Sue.</i>

19:36.484 --> 19:37.972
Yeah!

19:38.915 --> 19:40.156
<i>The only difference was,</i>

19:40.556 --> 19:43.947
<i>everybody knew who Axl was</i>
<i>and what he had done,</i>

19:43.948 --> 19:45.268
<i>but they didn't know who Sue was.</i>

19:48.199 --> 19:50.034
<i>She was like a superhero.</i>

19:50.280 --> 19:53.090
<i>When she was in plainclothes,</i>
<i>she was just Sue.</i>

19:53.290 --> 19:54.950
<i>But when she was in the mascot suit,</i>

19:55.106 --> 19:56.931
<i>she could do anything.</i>

19:57.493 --> 20:01.542
<i>Yep, so far, homecoming</i>
<i>had been a big success.</i>

20:01.669 --> 20:03.589
<i>But Axl still had</i>
<i>a little unfinished business.</i>

20:04.259 --> 20:06.880
Okay. Here's the corsage
right here.

20:06.991 --> 20:10.082
So come and get it... you.

20:10.191 --> 20:11.241
A wrist corsage?

20:11.358 --> 20:12.753
We don't wear those.

20:12.855 --> 20:14.717
We don't. They leave
marks on your wrists.

20:14.825 --> 20:16.801
- He's so sweet, though.
- Isn't he?

20:23.842 --> 20:26.977
Well?
Man, you still don't know?

20:27.114 --> 20:29.274
You better hurry. We're about
to leave for the dance.

20:29.276 --> 20:31.891
That's it. I'm just
going for it and picking one.

20:32.264 --> 20:35.530
I got a 60/40 chance, so,

20:35.955 --> 20:37.051
Courtney!

20:41.692 --> 20:42.848
Axl!

20:47.270 --> 20:48.328
Debbie!

20:51.343 --> 20:52.163
<i>What?</i>

20:52.269 --> 20:53.800
That was totally inappropriate.

20:53.920 --> 20:54.916
Totally.

20:55.251 --> 20:56.251
Hold on. Why are you mad?

20:56.252 --> 20:57.932
'Cause you're my girlfriend's best friend,

20:57.933 --> 21:00.573
or because you're my girlfriend,
and I kissed you inappropriately

21:00.574 --> 21:01.734
in front of your best friend?

21:01.735 --> 21:02.525
Wait! Don't go!

21:02.601 --> 21:04.919
One of you is really important to me!

21:08.483 --> 21:11.113
<i>So the bunny didn't exactly fix Brick,</i>

21:11.327 --> 21:12.895
<i>but it did bring us closer together</i>

21:12.997 --> 21:14.959
<i>in a way we never expected.</i>

21:16.475 --> 21:18.482
The thing is, life is messy,

21:18.584 --> 21:19.945
<i>but you gotta keep trying.</i>

21:20.118 --> 21:21.363
Look, I'm just really into you,

21:21.364 --> 21:23.364
and I think it'd be awesome
to get back together.

21:23.457 --> 21:25.057
Or go out for the first time.

21:26.092 --> 21:27.060
Hello?

21:27.807 --> 21:28.901
Hello?

21:29.282 --> 21:31.501
<i>It's a multipronged approach.</i>
