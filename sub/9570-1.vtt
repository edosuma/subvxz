02:04.336 --> 02:08.336
Thank you.

02:14.837 --> 02:17.137
Hey, has she been out yet?

02:17.141 --> 02:18.901
No, not yet.

02:18.982 --> 02:21.420
Can you cover for me?
Really need a coke and a piss.

02:21.422 --> 02:25.422
Get me one.

02:28.502 --> 02:30.500
Er, where's, er, what's-her-face?

02:30.502 --> 02:32.500
Erm, Jane's just gone to the loo.

02:32.502 --> 02:35.180
The boardroom needs setting up
for a meeting this afternoon.

02:35.182 --> 02:37.700
Of course. No problem.

02:37.702 --> 02:39.220
Er, Victoria?
Yes.

02:39.222 --> 02:41.980
Could I have a word, please?
Sure.

02:41.982 --> 02:45.700
I want you to have
a look at the Asian strategy.

02:45.702 --> 02:49.420
Sure, no problem.

02:49.422 --> 02:51.142
I would!

02:56.102 --> 03:00.102
Good morning -
Hewitt Maurice Asset Management...

03:20.182 --> 03:23.020
Erm, sorry, I thought the...
the meeting was...

03:23.022 --> 03:25.460
I'll just put these here.

03:25.462 --> 03:26.822
Calm down.

03:33.142 --> 03:36.900
Can I get you anything?

03:36.902 --> 03:38.940
Emmy, is it?

03:38.942 --> 03:40.980
- Effy.
- Effy.

03:40.982 --> 03:42.702
I'm fine, thanks.

03:49.102 --> 03:53.102
Idiot.

03:58.342 --> 04:01.740
Touching him where exactly? Arse?
Dick? Come on, I need specifics.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.220
Ew!

04:03.222 --> 04:06.740
Do you think he only goes for senior
analysts or the slammin' boobs count?

04:06.742 --> 04:08.342
Come on! Shut up!

04:10.382 --> 04:13.340
Oh, looks like Dominic's
just picked up an extra sandwich...

04:13.342 --> 04:17.341
as he was just passing... again.

04:17.942 --> 04:19.940
I picked up another sandwich,
just in case.

04:19.942 --> 04:21.980
You were just passing, right?

04:21.982 --> 04:25.982
Thanks, Dom.

04:26.142 --> 04:30.142
So you, er, you got any,
you know, plans after work?

04:30.502 --> 04:33.220
I'm just going to go home
and do some work there.

04:33.222 --> 04:36.422
Right, yeah, course.
Anything I can help with?

04:38.342 --> 04:40.580
That's really sweet. I'm fine.

04:40.582 --> 04:44.582
Well, I'm around, you know. Just
in case you fancy a quick one...

04:45.302 --> 04:49.100
Quick once... Er... I...
Once around the finance world

04:49.102 --> 04:51.340
a la Dominic!

04:51.342 --> 04:55.342
Thank you, Dom.

05:01.302 --> 05:02.682
Watch it, mate!

05:03.942 --> 05:07.942
Oh, my God. He is so tragic!

05:09.102 --> 05:13.102
You look like a horse when you
laugh down your nose like that.

05:33.302 --> 05:36.700
Leave it with me.

05:36.702 --> 05:39.420
Effy - I know this is really shitty

05:39.422 --> 05:42.100
but I really need the monthly
report documented by tonight.

05:42.102 --> 05:44.740
Any chance you could
just knock it out now?

05:44.742 --> 05:47.140
Sure. I'll just, erm, e-mail it.

05:47.142 --> 05:51.142
We'll be at the drinks thing
so maybe you can just pop it down.

05:52.222 --> 05:53.900
Is that OK?

05:53.902 --> 05:57.902
Fine.

06:25.222 --> 06:28.460
You're amazing. Thank you so much.

06:28.462 --> 06:31.220
Perfect.

06:31.222 --> 06:34.060
Did you want to come in
for a drink?
No, I'm fine.

06:34.062 --> 06:38.062
See you tomorrow.

07:48.182 --> 07:52.182
All right, Effy?

07:52.582 --> 07:56.582
Hey, where have you been?!

07:57.342 --> 07:58.380
Working.

07:58.382 --> 08:01.220
Effy! Are you joining
us on the juice?

08:01.222 --> 08:02.980
You seem to be doing all right
without me.

08:02.982 --> 08:06.982
Oh, we started at two.
I am gone, mate, I'm fuckin' gone.

08:07.062 --> 08:08.540
Congratulations.

08:08.542 --> 08:10.380
You all right?

08:10.382 --> 08:12.780
How was work?
Fine.

08:12.782 --> 08:15.500
Pub's too expensive so
we came back here.

08:15.502 --> 08:18.420
Save enough money to pay the rent?

08:18.422 --> 08:21.182
Potentially. Sit down, have a beer.

08:21.702 --> 08:25.702
Want one?

08:32.422 --> 08:36.422
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Look, have this.

08:36.542 --> 08:37.980
Naomi, you got any food?

08:37.982 --> 08:41.982
Naomi, you got any food?
Yes, plenty. What do you fancy?

08:42.381 --> 08:45.100
We got, er... steak.

08:45.102 --> 08:49.102
Where the fuck did that come from?

09:40.742 --> 09:42.580
Where the fuck have you been?

09:42.582 --> 09:45.020
Sorry. I've had people
round. Couldn't hear my laptop.

09:45.022 --> 09:47.660
Is this you trying to prove
a point? It's fucking hard here.

09:47.662 --> 09:50.180
Sorry! I just want to
speak to my girlfriend!

09:50.182 --> 09:52.300
I'm speaking to you now.
I'm just tired!

09:52.302 --> 09:54.340
You're not tired,
you're stoned. Again!

09:54.342 --> 09:56.020
Call me when you can be bothered.

09:56.022 --> 09:56.542
Ems? Ems?

09:58.422 --> 09:59.662
Fuck's sake!

10:00.462 --> 10:02.742
Don't you dare.

10:06.982 --> 10:09.140
Eff? I'm asleep.

10:09.142 --> 10:13.142
Oh, fine - fuck you, then.

10:22.982 --> 10:25.060
She's going to dump me.
No, she's not.

10:25.062 --> 10:28.100
New York's full of hot dykes.
Emily doesn't like hot dykes.

10:28.102 --> 10:31.420
She likes useless stoners like you.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.740
Mmm, yeah.

10:33.742 --> 10:36.980
Yeah. She loves me.

10:36.982 --> 10:40.580
Weirdly, yes.

10:40.582 --> 10:42.100
I'm going to go see her.

10:42.102 --> 10:44.740
I need some fanny time soon
or I'm going to burst into flames.

10:44.742 --> 10:48.742
Romantic.
You might need to get a job first.

10:49.582 --> 10:53.420
I think I'm going to be
a stand-up comedian.

10:53.422 --> 10:57.422
Brilliant. Go to sleep now.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.430
Jane, Jane... Jane, Jane, Jane!

12:06.478 --> 12:07.718
Jane, the idea is that you're

12:07.757 --> 12:09.875
conscious enough to answer
the phone, remember?

12:09.877 --> 12:12.875
I'm sorry, I had a... Associates'
meeting in five. You ready?

12:12.877 --> 12:15.875
Victoria? Victoria?

12:15.877 --> 12:17.995
I've been looking
through the monthly reports

12:17.997 --> 12:19.635
and the one from last night...
Why?

12:19.637 --> 12:23.155
I just have. But, look, look -
there's been a mistake.

12:23.157 --> 12:27.157
The monthly figures in the emerging
sectors haven't been updated.

12:27.357 --> 12:29.595
See there? Couldn't
some of the investors think

12:29.597 --> 12:31.155
we're trying to hide something?

12:31.157 --> 12:35.157
I'm sure it's fine. But thank
you, you know, for trying.

12:35.597 --> 12:36.275
Mark?

12:36.277 --> 12:37.995
Yo.

12:37.997 --> 12:41.997
Boys...

12:50.477 --> 12:52.195
Er, yeah, so the figures

12:52.197 --> 12:54.635
that have come down
from upstairs are, erm...

12:54.637 --> 12:56.517
Hang on a second. Let me find them.

13:00.397 --> 13:02.355
Yeah, Appendix 16.

13:02.357 --> 13:05.275
Er... as you can see, the growth
is negative, which we like,

13:05.277 --> 13:08.875
and we're in a
position to short it, so...

13:08.877 --> 13:10.435
Yeah, it's good.

13:10.437 --> 13:12.395
Mark, what the fuck is up with you?

13:12.397 --> 13:16.397
Er... John McAndrew came in
from Miami last night.

13:16.957 --> 13:18.075
He's such a dick.

13:18.077 --> 13:19.995
Well, I ended up out with him,

13:19.997 --> 13:21.915
and stayed out with him and, er...

13:21.917 --> 13:25.355
Save it for your wife.
Come on, what have you got?

13:25.357 --> 13:28.435
Yeah. Er... basically,
we should do it.

13:28.437 --> 13:31.075
Great. Any problems in legal?

13:31.077 --> 13:32.915
No. No problem. We're compliant.

13:32.917 --> 13:36.395
Great. I think that's it.
Thanks, Mark. That was shit.

13:36.397 --> 13:38.795
- But accurate.
- Congratulations.

13:38.797 --> 13:41.275
Have a cookie.
OK, that's everything.

13:41.277 --> 13:44.635
Let's keep the energy up, guys.
End of quarter is fast approaching.

13:44.637 --> 13:47.235
Sorry, Jake, just one thing...
What is it?

13:47.237 --> 13:50.035
There's been a fuck-up
with the emerging market numbers.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.395
How do you mean?

13:51.397 --> 13:55.397
They haven't been updated. They
don't reflect the returns at all.

13:58.277 --> 14:00.115
Has this gone out yet?

14:00.117 --> 14:01.275
No.

14:01.277 --> 14:04.715
Fine. Mark?

14:04.717 --> 14:07.915
Send that back upstairs, find the
fucking author of it, and fire them.

14:07.917 --> 14:09.155
Then you get it amended.

14:09.157 --> 14:11.835
We're not running a pissing
Ponzi here. Yeah, got it.

14:11.837 --> 14:13.755
Good.

14:13.757 --> 14:17.035
Thank you.

14:17.037 --> 14:18.717
Get me Chris on the
phone, tell him...

14:20.157 --> 14:24.157
What would I do without you?
Well done.

14:24.237 --> 14:28.237
Can we have coffees in Jake's
office, please? Decaf for me.

14:32.437 --> 14:34.235
They want coffee.

14:34.237 --> 14:38.237
Who does?

15:11.357 --> 15:12.595
Hi.

15:12.597 --> 15:14.355
Effy! Oh!

15:14.357 --> 15:16.275
Oh, no.

15:16.277 --> 15:19.235
It's OK. You... you're
not supposed to be in here.

15:19.237 --> 15:21.395
I know, but you
said you were around,

15:21.397 --> 15:23.115
and I need a drink right now.

15:23.117 --> 15:25.555
Right. Right, yeah, of course.

15:25.557 --> 15:29.115
But... hedge funders are
not allowed in here.

15:29.117 --> 15:31.115
She works in a hedge fund?

15:31.117 --> 15:33.995
Bloody fuck, Dom!

15:33.997 --> 15:36.235
She's looking, she's...
She's not looking!

15:36.237 --> 15:38.475
She's not looking. Are you?
Listen...

15:38.477 --> 15:42.477
Do you want to go for a
drink or not? I need your help.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.435
You didn't see her.
All right, Kevin?

15:46.437 --> 15:48.315
I quite clearly saw her.

15:48.317 --> 15:52.317
And I saw what you did on the sims
last week... with the thing.

15:54.277 --> 15:57.875
Yeah - keep your mouth shut.

15:57.877 --> 15:59.475
Let's go.

15:59.477 --> 16:03.477
Where are we going?

16:18.477 --> 16:21.675
This is a really nice place.
Very... warm.

16:21.677 --> 16:25.195
It's very expensive.

16:25.197 --> 16:28.355
All right?
Naomi, this is Dominic.

16:28.357 --> 16:30.075
Dominic!

16:30.077 --> 16:33.755
Dominic...
Who the fuck are you, Dominic?

16:33.757 --> 16:37.475
I'm a research strategist.

16:37.477 --> 16:40.835
Well, fuck me. What is that?

16:40.837 --> 16:43.315
I, er... research stuff...

16:43.317 --> 16:44.995
er... strategically.

16:44.997 --> 16:48.275
I thought you said
they were all dicks.

16:48.277 --> 16:52.277
No, I work in a completely
different building, so...

16:52.477 --> 16:54.075
Ugh...

16:54.077 --> 16:55.715
Are you all right?

16:55.717 --> 16:59.717
Yeah, just a, erm,
hysterical dyke, apparently.

16:59.917 --> 17:02.075
Is that a thing?

17:02.077 --> 17:05.275
I'm a hormone
hypochondriac, doctor said.

17:05.277 --> 17:06.675
Attention seeker.

17:06.676 --> 17:09.035
That's right. Takes
creative vision. Spliff?

17:09.037 --> 17:11.595
No. We've got stuff to do.

17:11.597 --> 17:14.194
What, right now?
Yep. Come on, Dom.

17:14.196 --> 17:18.196
I've been on my own all day!

17:22.077 --> 17:25.237
What are we doing?
I want to know. Know what?

17:25.717 --> 17:27.395
Everything.

17:27.396 --> 17:29.555
Everything that you know. Right.

17:29.557 --> 17:32.035
That's a lot. It's fine.

17:32.037 --> 17:35.035
Start from the beginning.

17:35.037 --> 17:38.955
Money. Show me.

17:38.957 --> 17:40.435
OK. Yeah.

17:40.437 --> 17:43.035
We could... OK, let's see.
We could start with the beginning.

17:43.037 --> 17:45.475
Neolithic barter systems.

17:45.477 --> 17:47.795
No. No, no, no,
that's too far back.

17:47.797 --> 17:50.315
OK, 18th-century mutual funds
and their bastard children.

17:50.317 --> 17:52.395
Derivatives and futures... OK.

17:52.397 --> 17:56.397
Check out the following algorithm...

17:58.437 --> 18:00.197
Hang on, slow down.

18:14.157 --> 18:16.757
- ..if you know how to short-sell...
- Yeah, so that means...

18:19.717 --> 18:21.757
Say it again...?

18:26.277 --> 18:29.115
Do you get it now?

18:29.117 --> 18:31.635
Thank you, Dom.

18:31.637 --> 18:33.035
Seriously.

18:33.037 --> 18:37.037
Thank you so much.

18:37.477 --> 18:38.635
Dom?

18:38.637 --> 18:41.115
Oh. I... I'm sorry.

18:41.117 --> 18:43.915
Oops. I'm not... I'm not sorry.
I'm not sorry. I just, erm...

18:43.917 --> 18:45.155
Dominic.

18:45.157 --> 18:48.075
No, no, no need to worry. I just...
I'm confused, obviously. I...

18:48.077 --> 18:51.395
I just...

18:51.397 --> 18:55.397
Shout if you're naked! Shout if
you're naked! Shout if you're naked!

18:57.037 --> 18:59.075
Hm, disappointing.

18:59.077 --> 19:00.635
We're finished.

19:00.637 --> 19:03.515
Ooh. Amazing. Because, erm...

19:03.517 --> 19:06.355
I was actually hoping you might
listen to some of my material.

19:06.357 --> 19:08.115
Please, please, please?

19:08.117 --> 19:10.115
Naomi wants to be
a stand-up comedian.

19:10.117 --> 19:12.195
Really? Wow, that's cool.
That's really cool.

19:12.197 --> 19:15.075
Well, thank you! We like him.

19:15.077 --> 19:17.635
I was thinking
about moving to London.

19:17.637 --> 19:18.955
What?

19:18.957 --> 19:20.715
No, I've... I've started. This is...

19:20.717 --> 19:22.355
Sorry.

19:22.357 --> 19:26.357
Anyway, so, London. Supposed to
be the city of opportunity, right?

19:26.917 --> 19:28.755
But, actually, only gets you the

19:28.757 --> 19:30.955
opportunity to get
fucked in the arse.

19:30.957 --> 19:32.635
Oh, my God.

19:32.637 --> 19:35.555
I mean, Boris bikes?
They're lovely, aren't they?

19:35.557 --> 19:38.235
Thank you, Mr Boris.
Thank you, Barclays Bank.

19:38.237 --> 19:41.595
But, those saddles, they're
not really for girls, are they?

19:41.597 --> 19:44.835
I mean, I think, every time
you sit in one of those saddles,

19:44.837 --> 19:47.357
it's basically like
letting Boris finger you.

19:50.077 --> 19:51.155
That's funny.

19:51.157 --> 19:52.355
Really?

19:52.357 --> 19:56.357
Yeah. You're really good.

19:56.517 --> 19:57.915
It's good.

19:57.917 --> 20:01.917
Mm, fan-dabi-dozi!

20:27.917 --> 20:30.075
Effy! Effy! Effy!

20:30.077 --> 20:31.795
Yes, Jane, that's my name.

20:31.797 --> 20:34.755
I forgot to cancel Victoria's meeting
with the fund of fund guys,

20:34.757 --> 20:36.015
and it starts in five minutes.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.555
And you stopped to tell me this why?

20:37.557 --> 20:40.155
Oh, fuck. Yeah, you're right!

20:40.157 --> 20:41.997
Run, Jane, run.

20:44.997 --> 20:48.555
Good morning, Hewitt Maurice
Asset Management...

20:48.557 --> 20:52.557
Yep. Yep, I'll be right down.

20:53.197 --> 20:54.595
She's going to fire me, isn't she?

20:54.597 --> 20:56.115
Probably.

20:56.117 --> 20:59.195
I'll do it.

20:59.197 --> 21:02.077
Thank you! Thank you!

21:02.557 --> 21:04.275
Thank you!

21:04.277 --> 21:08.277
Good morning,
Hewitt Maurice Asset Management...

21:18.915 --> 21:21.793
Mr Stibbard? Effy Stonem.
Pleased to meet you.

21:21.795 --> 21:25.073
I'm terribly sorry, but Victoria's
feeling under the weather.

21:25.075 --> 21:29.075
I see. And no-one
thought to let me know?

21:30.275 --> 21:34.275
She asked me to cover this meeting.
Can I take you for lunch?

21:35.035 --> 21:38.153
Yeah, I keep telling Victoria that
we're just not that into you.

21:38.155 --> 21:40.793
You're a single fund.

21:40.795 --> 21:44.153
She's just not getting it.

21:44.155 --> 21:48.155
What is Hewitt Maurice's
sudden interest in fund of funds?

21:50.795 --> 21:53.673
Well...

21:53.675 --> 21:55.233
maybe she's just too polite

21:55.235 --> 21:59.235
to tell you that we know
you have a liquidity issue.

22:00.875 --> 22:02.193
Really?

22:02.195 --> 22:03.513
Really.

22:03.515 --> 22:06.073
In the current climate,
we need to diversify,

22:06.075 --> 22:09.153
and you are going to need
some significant cash,

22:09.155 --> 22:13.155
within the next two months -
if my research is correct.

22:16.475 --> 22:17.793
OK, go on.

22:17.795 --> 22:21.075
Well, we've been looking
into your investments...

22:38.555 --> 22:42.555
OK.

22:44.195 --> 22:45.953
I told Jane to cancel the meeting.

22:45.955 --> 22:48.633
As far as I was concerned,
it was being rearranged.

22:48.635 --> 22:51.233
- What the hell where you thinking?
- I don't know what came over me.

22:51.235 --> 22:54.633
Don't give me that shit.
You're a fucking assistant.

22:54.635 --> 22:56.353
Vic... Jesus fucking Christ!

22:56.355 --> 23:00.355
Vic! What?!

23:00.435 --> 23:02.073
All right.

23:02.075 --> 23:06.075
You fucking deal with her, then.

23:12.315 --> 23:13.833
So, am I fired?

23:13.835 --> 23:15.593
Looks like it.

23:15.595 --> 23:17.313
That's bullshit.

23:17.315 --> 23:19.793
You could have lost us an
incredibly valuable investment.

23:19.795 --> 23:23.795
And did I?

23:23.875 --> 23:25.673
That's not the point.

23:25.675 --> 23:28.113
I was good in there. Really good.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.353
Yeah?

23:30.355 --> 23:33.553
That's what Stibbard said, too.

23:33.555 --> 23:35.713
Well, you'd better go.

23:35.715 --> 23:39.715
Pack your things.

23:39.795 --> 23:43.795
I'm sorry.

23:47.635 --> 23:49.000
Pussy.

23:55.158 --> 23:57.636
No, er... can I take a message?

23:57.638 --> 24:01.638
Yeah... OK.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.381
Just been fired.

24:03.383 --> 24:06.461
What? You're the only one
that understands Excel.

24:06.463 --> 24:09.341
Not my problem any more.

24:09.343 --> 24:11.583
You know, this is
shitting unfair dismissal.

24:11.661 --> 24:12.699
It's not really.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.321
He's a cunt and she's a cunt

24:14.392 --> 24:16.592
and I'm gonna go in there
and say something.

24:20.752 --> 24:24.752
Mr Abassi. Could I get you some...?

24:29.392 --> 24:33.392
And you can stop scowling at me,
for a start. I need to talk to you.

24:33.592 --> 24:37.592
Could you hack it in there?

24:37.832 --> 24:38.870
What do you mean?

24:38.872 --> 24:42.350
Could you handle
Stibbard's investment?

24:42.352 --> 24:43.990
You want me to be a trader?

24:43.992 --> 24:47.110
I'm giving you the chance
to trade for one client.

24:47.112 --> 24:48.830
Yes or no?

24:48.832 --> 24:50.830
Yes.

24:50.832 --> 24:53.470
Good.

24:53.472 --> 24:56.310
Glad we don't have to do
the whole tribunal thing.

24:56.312 --> 24:57.470
Don't tempt me.

24:57.472 --> 24:58.990
Do I get a raise?

24:58.992 --> 25:02.992
No.

25:57.752 --> 26:01.270
Come on, Naoms.

26:01.272 --> 26:02.710
What do you want me to do?

26:02.712 --> 26:06.590
I know you've got more to tell me
about it, Steve, come on.

26:06.592 --> 26:09.750
I know it touched 105 yesterday.
Don't bullshit me.

26:09.752 --> 26:12.790
Yeah, didn't ask
for a fucking partial fill.

26:12.792 --> 26:14.310
Is everybody seeing this?

26:14.312 --> 26:17.550
Can we all please
keep an eye on this?!

26:17.552 --> 26:18.710
Er... what is going on?

26:18.712 --> 26:20.552
300,020, right. Now.

26:33.352 --> 26:35.510
You are jealous.
The way you look at her,

26:35.512 --> 26:36.790
the way you look at me.

26:36.792 --> 26:39.190
Of a 20-year-old girl? Look at me!

26:39.192 --> 26:43.192
Do you think I really need to be
jealous of a 20-year-old girl?

26:43.232 --> 26:46.832
Bye!

27:00.752 --> 27:04.190
Mark? Mark? Do you know
why Gray Leverson's falling?

27:04.192 --> 27:07.070
Yeah, yeah, I can see that,
It's whether we move now or...?

27:07.072 --> 27:11.072
It's dropped 15% since we opened.
Do I move? Have... have you gone?

27:11.512 --> 27:13.310
It's your portfolio, sweetheart.

27:13.312 --> 27:15.150
It will level out, right?

27:15.152 --> 27:16.990
The CEO's leaving, Elf girl.

27:16.992 --> 27:19.710
Do you need any more confirmation
there's trouble on deck?

27:19.712 --> 27:21.030
So, what you are gonna do?

27:21.032 --> 27:22.070
Did you move?

27:22.072 --> 27:23.792
Got out hours ago.

27:39.712 --> 27:41.070
What's wrong?

27:41.072 --> 27:43.790
I'm fucking it up.

27:43.792 --> 27:47.110
I thought I could keep up, but I
can't. I don't know what I'm doing.

27:47.112 --> 27:50.630
I've lost on everything
this month, Dom. Everything.

27:50.632 --> 27:54.632
Yeah, that's what trading's like.
You go months not doing well.

27:55.272 --> 27:59.272
I know, I know, but now
Gray Leverson's falling like shit

27:59.432 --> 28:01.230
and I'm supposed
to be up there selling.

28:01.232 --> 28:02.950
Right now I'm supposed
to be making a move.

28:02.952 --> 28:04.670
So, why aren't you?

28:04.672 --> 28:08.672
I don't know. Just a hunch.
Something's not right.

28:09.312 --> 28:10.790
Or I'm just shit.

28:10.792 --> 28:14.792
No, you're not shit.

28:16.912 --> 28:19.150
You know something, don't you?

28:19.152 --> 28:20.390
No, I don't.

28:20.392 --> 28:21.750
Yes. Yes, you do.

28:21.752 --> 28:23.230
- No!
- What is it?

28:23.232 --> 28:24.790
No, stop. It's illegal. So, no.

28:24.792 --> 28:26.430
We're supposed to be friends.

28:26.432 --> 28:28.710
Yeah, and I told you
I don't want to be your friend.

28:28.712 --> 28:30.950
Dom, I can't deal
with that right now.

28:30.952 --> 28:32.872
I'm sorry,
but you can't ask me to pretend...

28:33.912 --> 28:37.912
I'm not thinking it,
cos I am and I...

28:38.552 --> 28:42.552
I need to take this.
Hello? Hi.

28:43.032 --> 28:47.032
Yeah, yeah.

28:50.232 --> 28:52.390
And, John, Gray Leverson.

28:52.392 --> 28:55.070
Yeah, I'll get the takeover analysis
to you this afternoon

28:55.072 --> 28:56.670
ready for the announcement.

28:56.672 --> 29:00.672
And, yeah, it's all totally
embargoed. Yeah. Great. Bye.

29:02.792 --> 29:06.190
You're not here. OK?
You're not here, you're not...

29:06.192 --> 29:08.910
Thank you, Dom.

29:08.912 --> 29:12.912
Hurry!

29:14.312 --> 29:18.312
Bollocks.

29:30.072 --> 29:31.350
Bad day, little Elf?

29:31.352 --> 29:32.750
It happens.

29:32.752 --> 29:36.752
You'll have to try harder,
won't you?

29:47.952 --> 29:49.390
Hello?

29:49.392 --> 29:53.070
Hi, this is Elf here,
from Hewitt Maurice.

29:53.072 --> 29:56.390
Hi, I'd like to buy 300,000 shares
in Gray Leverson, please.

29:56.392 --> 29:58.750
What the fuck are you doing?

29:58.752 --> 29:59.950
Ssh!

29:59.952 --> 30:02.190
Thank you, thank you very much.

30:02.192 --> 30:03.590
Are you watching this, guys?

30:03.592 --> 30:07.592
I've never actually seen someone
commit professional suicide.

30:11.912 --> 30:13.670
Keep watching.

30:13.672 --> 30:15.032
Ooh!

30:21.592 --> 30:25.470
Please explain to me. Gray Leverson's
going positive. I don't get it.

30:25.472 --> 30:28.230
Hold on. Smith, you seen this, mate?

30:28.232 --> 30:30.710
Turn it up.

30:30.712 --> 30:34.712
'The takeover of Gray Leverson
by the mega-cap Rubetron Group

30:35.352 --> 30:37.470
'has seen their
share prices rise by 15%,

30:37.472 --> 30:41.190
'with further rises predicted
before closing today.

30:41.192 --> 30:45.030
'The CEO states that the deal
will be accreted to EBS.'

30:45.032 --> 30:46.070
Look at the price.

30:46.072 --> 30:50.072
I don't understand. Everyone was
so fucking sure. Elfie. Elfie!

30:50.192 --> 30:52.150
Yes, Mark?

30:52.152 --> 30:52.990
What are you doing?

30:52.992 --> 30:56.992
Well, now I'm selling.

31:01.192 --> 31:02.310
Chris?

31:02.312 --> 31:04.470
Do you wanna explain
what the fuck went down there?

31:04.472 --> 31:06.830
Course I heard the news.

31:06.832 --> 31:09.832
No, that isn't what you fucking said!

31:12.512 --> 31:16.512
We've got 70K each
on the fucking portfolios.

31:59.952 --> 32:02.030
Hey, I'm finished.

32:02.032 --> 32:05.230
I'll see you tomorrow.

32:05.232 --> 32:09.150
How much did you make for us today?

32:09.152 --> 32:13.152
1.2 million.

32:13.952 --> 32:17.952
You got any cigarettes?

32:40.272 --> 32:43.590
Max Stibbard's coming in on Friday.

32:43.592 --> 32:46.430
He's, um... asked
to meet our star trader.

32:46.432 --> 32:47.470
Victoria?

32:47.472 --> 32:51.472
No... You.

32:53.832 --> 32:57.270
He's very happy
with the relationship.

32:57.272 --> 33:00.270
So are we.

33:00.272 --> 33:03.310
That's good.
Maybe he'll invest again.

33:03.312 --> 33:07.312
Maybe.

33:08.232 --> 33:10.030
You should take him out.

33:10.032 --> 33:13.750
Show him that we're... fun.

33:13.752 --> 33:17.752
Plus, Max is a sucker
for beautiful women.

33:19.392 --> 33:23.392
Do you have a problem with that?

33:24.072 --> 33:25.630
No.

33:25.632 --> 33:27.630
Within reason.

33:27.632 --> 33:31.070
Course.

33:31.072 --> 33:34.070
People shouldn't
underestimate you, should they?

33:34.072 --> 33:36.910
Miss Stonem.

33:36.912 --> 33:40.912
No.

33:47.752 --> 33:51.752
I should go.

33:52.792 --> 33:55.310
Effy?

33:55.312 --> 33:59.312
Your cigarettes.

34:01.472 --> 34:04.230
Friday.

34:04.232 --> 34:08.232
OK.

34:26.351 --> 34:28.389
What were you doing in there?

34:28.391 --> 34:32.391
Just thinking. It's quiet.

34:33.351 --> 34:34.949
You had a good day on the floor.

34:34.952 --> 34:36.070
Yeah, I did.

34:36.072 --> 34:40.072
Clever girl.

34:40.592 --> 34:44.270
How did you know it was a takeover?

34:44.272 --> 34:46.830
Just a feeling, I guess.

34:46.831 --> 34:48.989
Right.

34:48.992 --> 34:51.989
A feeling.

34:51.992 --> 34:53.070
I'll see you tomorrow.

34:53.072 --> 34:56.870
No, you won't, actually.

34:56.871 --> 35:00.230
I've decided to move on.

35:00.232 --> 35:02.870
Why?

35:02.872 --> 35:06.550
Sick of wearing heels.

35:06.552 --> 35:09.910
Good luck with that.

35:09.912 --> 35:12.350
Yeah, good luck to you, too.

35:12.352 --> 35:16.352
See you around.

35:20.312 --> 35:23.792
I always liked it in there, too.

35:25.392 --> 35:29.392
Victoria!

35:29.952 --> 35:31.316
Vic!

35:50.003 --> 35:52.721
Good evening, Deptford.
Is this still London?

35:52.723 --> 35:54.321
Fuck, that's awful.

35:54.323 --> 35:56.601
This one or this one?

35:56.603 --> 35:59.201
What?
Which dress?

35:59.203 --> 36:01.401
I'm trying to work here.
Work?

36:01.403 --> 36:04.401
Yes, it's my first gig tonight
and you're supposed to be coming.

36:04.403 --> 36:08.403
You were supposed to be coming
to the doctor's too, but, hey...

36:10.083 --> 36:14.083
I'm sorry, it's a work thing.
If you say so.

36:16.483 --> 36:19.043
I've got to go.

36:25.443 --> 36:29.443
OK.

36:56.363 --> 36:58.123
100,000.

37:38.283 --> 37:39.921
Wow!

37:39.923 --> 37:42.081
I do like this.

37:42.083 --> 37:44.761
Makes you look older.
Oh, well, thanks.

37:44.763 --> 37:48.361
No, I mean you... you look good.

37:48.363 --> 37:51.721
Are you here to baby-sit me? Don't
you have somewhere else to be?

37:51.723 --> 37:53.281
I do. He needs to see me,

37:53.283 --> 37:56.281
otherwise he's going to try
and roll over you.

37:56.283 --> 37:59.761
You make it sound like
I'm going into a war zone.

37:59.763 --> 38:01.961
Money is war.

38:01.963 --> 38:03.921
I get it.

38:03.923 --> 38:07.923
Good.

38:08.163 --> 38:10.921
He needs to think
that he's winning.

38:10.923 --> 38:14.923
When, in fact... you are.

38:15.883 --> 38:19.883
Am I?

38:25.723 --> 38:29.043
Easy, boss.

38:53.563 --> 38:56.521
Mr Stibbard. You know Jake Abassi?

38:56.523 --> 38:58.841
Call me Max, for fuck's sake.

38:58.843 --> 39:00.881
Jake, how you doing?

39:00.883 --> 39:02.721
Max.

39:02.723 --> 39:05.881
You know my associate Freddie?
Yes, I've heard of you.

39:05.883 --> 39:08.401
Too bloody right you have! How come
all of Jake's traders are hot?

39:08.403 --> 39:11.361
All of ours look like
diseased hamsters.

39:11.363 --> 39:15.161
Well, on that appetising note,
I have a dinner appointment.

39:15.163 --> 39:17.921
I'll leave you to it.

39:17.923 --> 39:21.923
Be nice, Max.
Oh, you can rely on it.

39:23.003 --> 39:27.003
So, how do you two gentlemen
feel about comedy?

39:27.883 --> 39:30.201
Bethnal Green!

39:30.203 --> 39:32.081
I've been Ben Tarrington!

39:32.083 --> 39:34.323
Thank you and fuck off!

39:38.603 --> 39:40.961
Thank you, Ben Tarrington!

39:40.963 --> 39:43.441
There you go.
Fantastic stuff. Whoo!

39:43.443 --> 39:46.401
Thank you.
That was Ben there. Ben, wonderful.

39:46.403 --> 39:48.081
My wife doesn't like the anal sex,

39:48.083 --> 39:49.961
but I still make her
do it to me anyway.

39:49.963 --> 39:52.801
Um... so, time for the next act,
ladies and gentlemen.

39:52.803 --> 39:55.921
Next we have Naomi Campbell!

39:55.923 --> 39:57.961
So, er... where is she?
Where's Naomi?

39:57.963 --> 40:00.923
Oh, there she is. Er... put your
hands together for Naomi Campbell!

40:02.603 --> 40:04.761
Is this your friend?

40:04.763 --> 40:05.923
Yeah!

40:11.923 --> 40:15.923
So, who here is from London?

40:18.283 --> 40:19.361
No-one?

40:19.363 --> 40:22.081
Oh, er... good.

40:22.083 --> 40:25.761
Um... now I don't have to pretend
to fucking like it here.

40:25.763 --> 40:29.361
Um... I'm... I'm new to London.
CROWD MURMURING

40:29.363 --> 40:32.321
Um... I moved here
with my girlfriend, er...

40:32.323 --> 40:33.603
Fucking dyke.

40:37.603 --> 40:40.841
Um... yeah, I am, actually.

40:40.843 --> 40:44.161
Um... so, London...

40:44.163 --> 40:45.341
no-one actually tells you

40:45.343 --> 40:48.161
what it's really like to live here,
do they? I mean, Boris bikes?

40:48.163 --> 40:50.121
Am I the only one who thinks

40:50.123 --> 40:53.921
it's vaguely creepy that
one man owns all the bikes?

40:53.923 --> 40:55.601
I mean, I'm... I'm riding along

40:55.603 --> 40:56.961
and all I can think is,

40:56.963 --> 41:00.401
isn't this pretty much like
letting Boris finger you?

41:00.403 --> 41:02.641
You're shit!

41:02.643 --> 41:06.081
Ooh!

41:06.083 --> 41:08.281
Do you know what? Fuck you.

41:08.283 --> 41:10.761
Fuck you and your
small-dick complex.

41:10.763 --> 41:12.763
Ooh!

41:15.723 --> 41:17.041
Shall we just go?

41:17.043 --> 41:20.081
No, I'm just starting to
enjoy it now.

41:20.083 --> 41:22.283
Loser!

41:24.683 --> 41:28.683
Fuck you all.

41:32.403 --> 41:36.403
It really wasn't that bad.
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

41:37.083 --> 41:39.241
Look, I need to go.

41:39.243 --> 41:42.441
I'm going to kill myself.

41:42.443 --> 41:46.443
Come on, funny girl. You come
and have a drink with us.

41:50.163 --> 41:51.203
Ladies.

41:52.763 --> 41:56.081
What the actual fuck?
Please, please, Naomi.

41:56.083 --> 41:58.921
Just keep your mouth shut and try
and pretend to have a good time.

41:58.923 --> 42:00.801
Who are they anyway?

42:00.803 --> 42:02.841
They're very important investors.

42:02.843 --> 42:06.761
No more bets.

42:06.763 --> 42:07.841
I just think it's weird,

42:07.843 --> 42:10.121
a job that involves making money
and nothing else.

42:10.123 --> 42:12.281
I...I make people happy.

42:12.283 --> 42:14.841
You make people rich,
that's all. Fuck everyone else.

42:14.843 --> 42:16.041
Naomi...

42:16.043 --> 42:19.763
Kiss it luck, girl.

42:22.763 --> 42:26.763
Any more bets, please?

42:27.763 --> 42:30.481
How much is that?

42:30.483 --> 42:34.483
- A grand.
- No more bets.

42:34.683 --> 42:37.241
Come on, come on, come on,
come on. Come on, come on.

42:37.243 --> 42:40.121
Come on, come on.

42:40.123 --> 42:42.521
Ah!
29 black.

42:42.523 --> 42:46.523
It's your fault, Naomi. You were
supposed to fucking kiss it.

42:51.963 --> 42:53.681
Chips, sir.
OK, beautiful.

42:53.683 --> 42:56.361
Now you show me how you win.

42:56.363 --> 42:59.441
I think we're going to do
great things, you and I.

42:59.443 --> 43:01.523
With money?

43:01.565 --> 43:04.323
Of course.

43:04.325 --> 43:07.683
No more bets, please.

43:07.685 --> 43:09.363
I need to talk to you.

43:09.365 --> 43:12.883
Hey!
No, we need the talent at the table!

43:12.885 --> 43:15.323
What the fuck is this, Eff?

43:15.325 --> 43:18.323
What's wrong with you now?
Why is he touching you?

43:18.325 --> 43:20.003
These are big investors, Naomi.

43:20.005 --> 43:22.803
That's fucked. Please tell me
you can see that.

43:22.805 --> 43:26.243
Yes, get in!
Go home, Naomi.

43:26.245 --> 43:28.523
I need to talk to you.
I have to go somewhere.

43:28.525 --> 43:30.963
Not now. I'm busy.

43:30.965 --> 43:34.105
They're disgusting. Why can't you
see how disgusting they are?

43:34.129 --> 43:37.369
Go home, Naomi!

43:38.889 --> 43:42.889
Go.
Effy, get over here!

43:55.849 --> 43:58.847
Hey!

43:58.849 --> 44:02.849
A winner. Let's see you
do it again.

45:04.169 --> 45:06.727
Naomi?

45:06.729 --> 45:08.249
Naomi!

45:09.609 --> 45:13.527
Naomi!

45:13.529 --> 45:17.047
Naomi!

45:17.049 --> 45:19.087
What the fuck are you doing?

45:19.089 --> 45:21.167
Turn it off!

45:21.169 --> 45:24.127
Naomi!

45:24.129 --> 45:26.247
Stop being so fucking mental!

45:26.249 --> 45:28.769
Turn it off now!

45:30.209 --> 45:34.209
Naomi, I'm fucking sick of this.
What is wrong with you?

45:41.089 --> 45:43.487
Got cancer.

45:43.489 --> 45:44.727
What did you say?

45:44.729 --> 45:48.567
Cancer! OK? I've got fucking cancer!

45:48.569 --> 45:50.769
You win! You win again!

47:08.409 --> 47:11.407
Oh, my God. Emily!
Hi!

47:11.409 --> 47:13.007
She deserves to know
what's going on.

47:13.009 --> 47:15.047
I can't remember the figures
ever being this low.

47:15.049 --> 47:18.207
I need an Effy special.
Could you make that happen?

47:18.209 --> 47:21.287
I need you to tell me that
this isn't as bad as I think it is.

47:21.289 --> 47:24.413
Before you, I was fine,
and now I'm fucking pathetic!
