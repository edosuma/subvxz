WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.795
<i>Jess was supposed to call when her
and her dad got across the border.</i>

00:03.795 --> 00:04.879
<i>Billie's got her.</i>

00:04.879 --> 00:06.381
Well, what do we have here?

00:07.215 --> 00:08.800
- Give me that medallion.
- Ah!

00:08.800 --> 00:11.052
- What is that?
- It's a Wayfinder.

00:11.052 --> 00:12.387
It's like an ancient compass.

00:12.387 --> 00:13.722
Only it doesn't work.

00:13.722 --> 00:14.723
But it will work.

00:14.723 --> 00:16.182
When we're close to the treasure.

00:16.182 --> 00:18.143
- What are you doing?
- You murdered Peter Sadusky.

00:18.143 --> 00:20.645
That's why you were pushing me
to arrest Jess Valenzuela.

00:20.645 --> 00:22.814
I've detained a murder suspect.
He'll be waiting for you.

00:22.814 --> 00:24.774
My grandpa sent me this book
before he died.

00:24.774 --> 00:25.859
He's trying to send me
a secret message.

00:25.859 --> 00:29.571
"All lost treasures, all found,
all destroyed..."

00:29.571 --> 00:30.947
<i>Billie isn't a treasure hunter.</i>

00:30.947 --> 00:32.157
<i>She's a treasure destroyer.</i>

00:32.157 --> 00:34.492
But the leader is Salazar.

00:34.492 --> 00:38.538
We are about to find
the great Pan-American treasure.

00:38.538 --> 00:41.416
Freeze! Your treasure hunt is over.
The police are on their way.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.671
Salazar.

00:55.930 --> 00:56.848
You killed her!

00:56.848 --> 00:57.891
Jessita.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.479
What are you doing here, Salazar?

01:02.979 --> 01:05.607
I've been waiting for this moment
for the past 20 years.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.694
Why are these two still alive?

01:09.694 --> 01:11.738
We wouldn't be here without them.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.407
I thought I'd keep them around
until we found the treasure.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.493
I'm telling you...

01:17.494 --> 01:18.745
he killed your brother.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.998
He's gonna stab you in the back next.

01:21.998 --> 01:24.834
Rafael, I see you're still the same liar
you were

01:24.834 --> 01:26.586
when you pretended to work with us.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.339
He's an even bigger liar.

01:31.549 --> 01:32.717
You two, guard the road.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.719
Come on, let's go. We're wasting time.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.559
Careful with this bag. It's got C-4 in it.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.996
The Wayfinder says to head south.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.502
They killed Agent Ross.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.295
And they have Jess,
we gotta call the police.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.839
We haven't had a cell signal
since we got here.

02:10.839 --> 02:11.923
Okay, so let's go find one!

02:11.923 --> 02:13.299
Jess is on that boat.

02:13.299 --> 02:14.425
We're not going anywhere.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.469
Well, there's one of them and four of us.

02:16.469 --> 02:17.720
Yeah, but he has a gun.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.974
We could sneak around his flank. Right?
Try to get him from behind.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.767
- While you guys, uh--
- Distract me?

02:24.060 --> 02:25.145
Yeah.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.691
The police will be here any minute.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.734
If you let us go,
we'll tell them you helped us.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.196
You're bluffing.
No cell phone service out here.

02:36.114 --> 02:38.116
Who do you think called that FBI agent?

02:39.033 --> 02:40.368
And there's more coming.

02:47.041 --> 02:47.917
What do you wanna do?

02:47.917 --> 02:49.961
Shoot them and dump them
in the swamp with the gators.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.045
Starting with this one.

02:51.045 --> 02:52.547
- No, wait, wait! No, no!
- Whoa, whoa, no!

02:52.547 --> 02:54.132
You guys hear that?

02:54.132 --> 02:55.216
Gunshot.

03:02.056 --> 03:03.183
Betsy!

03:05.685 --> 03:08.688
Oh, my god, those guys are dead.
They were gonna kill us.

03:11.149 --> 03:12.275
She's been stabbed,
we need to put pressure on it.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.027
Yeah, here.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.446
We need to get her to a hospital soon
or she will die!

03:16.446 --> 03:17.363
Let's get her into my van.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.157
We'll find a highway.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.409
As soon as we get service,
we're gonna call 911, okay?

03:21.409 --> 03:24.996
You guys go ahead.
Ethan and I, we're going after Jess.

03:24.996 --> 03:26.206
Go get our girl.

03:27.165 --> 03:27.999
Go.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.419
- We'll take that boat.
- Okay, come on.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.215
You know what, Billie?

03:36.257 --> 03:37.592
I was wrong about you.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.094
Second-guessed you the whole way.

03:41.596 --> 03:42.597
It's not your fault.

03:42.597 --> 03:43.806
You're a man.

03:44.974 --> 03:47.435
Cortes did the same to Malinche.

03:52.982 --> 03:54.651
It's too shallow for the outboard.

03:54.651 --> 03:57.278
All right, we're gonna have
to use the poles.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.591
We're never gonna catch them.
We're pushing through sludge.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.134
Just take it one stroke at a time.

04:21.386 --> 04:24.389
Man, this is taking me back
to my Boy Scouting days.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.807
Hey, you were a Boy Scout?

04:25.807 --> 04:27.308
My dad signed me up.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.103
Wanted me to be an adventurer like him.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.771
If only he could see me now.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.189
What rank did you get up to?

04:33.773 --> 04:34.691
Doesn't matter.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.359
You didn't make it past Tenderfoot,
did you?

04:36.359 --> 04:37.777
Didn't make it past Scout.

04:37.777 --> 04:38.945
Oh.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.363
Huh, how far did you get?

04:42.865 --> 04:43.783
Eagle.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.329
I got a bar!

04:48.997 --> 04:50.915
Wait. No, no, I don't.

04:50.915 --> 04:53.167
- Oh, come on.
- Hey.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.128
Don't you worry, we got you.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.796
Okay? You just relax.

04:57.672 --> 04:58.798
If I don't make it,

04:58.798 --> 05:00.258
tell the police

05:00.258 --> 05:02.760
Hendricks killed Sadusky.

05:02.760 --> 05:06.097
Nope, I'm not gonna tell them that
because you're gonna tell them yourself.

05:07.015 --> 05:07.849
Okay?

05:10.143 --> 05:11.311
Oren.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.854
I know, "drive faster."

05:13.980 --> 05:15.273
No, I'm scared.

05:17.191 --> 05:18.109
Me too.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.370
What is that?

06:52.370 --> 06:54.288
<i>La Niebla de la muerte.</i>

06:55.164 --> 06:56.624
What now?

06:57.375 --> 06:59.419
The Wayfinder says keep going.

07:00.002 --> 07:01.087
Then we keep going.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.134
I've never seen fog this thick.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.802
I told you.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.387
It's the fog of death.

07:10.221 --> 07:11.305
He's right.

07:11.305 --> 07:13.558
Hernando De Soto was rumored
to have written a letter

07:13.558 --> 07:15.226
to the King of Spain about it

07:15.226 --> 07:17.895
when he explored the Mississippi in 1541.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.814
He lost a lot of men.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.149
Is that true?

07:21.149 --> 07:23.693
I heard these waters are haunted.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.445
They're just trying to spook you.

07:25.445 --> 07:29.031
De Soto didn't lose any man in the fog.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.076
Only in battles.

07:32.076 --> 07:35.288
Even so, De Soto died
in these very waters.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.750
Bad luck for conquistadors.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.794
This place is giving me the creeps.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.296
Ignore them.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.464
Keep going.

07:45.798 --> 07:49.135
What does the Boy Scout handbook say
about getting lost in a fog?

07:49.135 --> 07:50.970
Stay put and wait for it to pass.

07:52.013 --> 07:52.847
Can't do that.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.268
I can't see a thing.

07:57.268 --> 07:58.728
Bear left.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.149
Whoa. Close, close.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.694
We've run aground.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.446
We've hit a sandbar or something.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.490
See if you can push off.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.784
You're an FBI agent.

08:13.784 --> 08:15.536
You took an oath,

08:15.536 --> 08:16.871
but you're nothing

08:16.871 --> 08:19.624
more than a greedy treasure hunter.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.918
Hector, see if you can push off
on your side.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.712
You got it all wrong, Jess.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.255
We're the good guys.

08:26.255 --> 08:28.633
We're not here to get rich.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.384
We're here for the greater good.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.720
When secrets of the past get unburied,

08:32.720 --> 08:34.764
it rewrites history.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.433
It creates conflict. War.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.772
People suddenly feel cheated out
of something that

08:42.772 --> 08:44.398
they never even knew they had.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.484
I'm gonna get out
and see how big this thing is.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.530
You're going to destroy the treasure.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.536
Nothing more dangerous than the truth.

08:59.580 --> 09:04.502
The Pan-American treasure
is a political powder keg.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.588
<i>Cras Est Nostrum...</i>

09:08.881 --> 09:10.550
keeps the status quo.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.803
<i>Cras Est Nostrum.</i>

09:16.430 --> 09:19.016
"Tomorrow is ours."

09:19.642 --> 09:21.435
And tomorrow is ours

09:22.103 --> 09:24.105
because yesterday is ours too.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.399
There's no getting over
this sandbar.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.651
But it leads to a jetty
about ten yards away.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.319
Seems we have to walk from here.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.406
Hey, didn't we just pass that tree?

09:35.324 --> 09:38.369
Yeah, I don't know.
Everything looks the damn same.

09:39.328 --> 09:41.622
I feel like we just keep going
in circles, man.

09:41.622 --> 09:42.915
I was thinking that.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.084
I was hoping you wouldn't say it.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.546
- I got a bar.
- Yeah?

09:48.546 --> 09:49.714
Call 911.

09:53.968 --> 09:54.802
Hello?

09:54.802 --> 09:57.763
Hi. Hi, we have an FBI agent
that has been stabbed.

09:57.763 --> 10:00.182
We need police and paramedics right away.

10:00.182 --> 10:04.145
Where? Uh, eh, somewhere
in the Devil's Swamp?

10:04.770 --> 10:06.772
I don't know.
There's, there's no street signs.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.065
We're on a swampy path.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.692
I, I don't, I don't know!

10:09.692 --> 10:11.444
Uh. Look, I know it's a big swamp.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.987
Can't you just trace my phone?

10:13.571 --> 10:16.741
Okay, okay. I'll keep driving
until I can tell you where we are.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.876
Looks like ruins to a temple or something.

10:28.002 --> 10:31.172
How'd they get these heavy stones
all the way out here?

10:31.172 --> 10:33.549
Indigenous people
were brilliant architects.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.510
Whoa.

10:37.261 --> 10:38.554
Check this out.

10:40.681 --> 10:43.059
One of Hernando De Soto's men.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.062
More than one. Look.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.730
How did they find this place?

10:47.730 --> 10:50.733
I'm guessing they tortured
a Daughter of the Plumed Serpent.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.069
Conquistadors were pretty good at that.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.321
Then why did they kill each other?

10:55.905 --> 10:56.864
They got greedy.

10:57.531 --> 10:58.449
No.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.327
No, something's not right.

11:01.327 --> 11:04.747
You don't get greedy and kill each other
until after you find the treasure.

11:04.747 --> 11:07.458
Hey, it looks like
there's something over there.

11:22.598 --> 11:23.724
A coyote.

11:23.724 --> 11:24.809
The Coyote is a trickster.

11:25.559 --> 11:26.435
It means it's a trap.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.145
Death's just around the corner.

11:28.145 --> 11:29.397
Are those emeralds?

11:29.397 --> 11:30.648
In his eyes.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.525
We're not here for the jewels.

11:35.486 --> 11:36.904
Just a souvenir.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.034
Hector, you okay?

11:42.034 --> 11:43.369
I'm fine.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.209
- Look out!
- This was a trap.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.419
He's hallucinating.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.212
They're everywhere!

11:53.796 --> 11:55.715
They... they're everywhere.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.049
Hector?

11:57.675 --> 11:59.301
Hector? Calm down.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.303
Everyone, get down!

12:02.388 --> 12:03.431
Hector!

12:05.474 --> 12:07.476
- Jess.
- Let's hope not.

12:07.476 --> 12:09.186
It came from over there. Come on.

12:14.358 --> 12:15.317
Kacey.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.403
You've been shot.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.448
I'm okay. I'm fine.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.408
We lost Jess and Rafael.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.409
They cut themselves loose.

12:23.409 --> 12:26.245
They knew that coyote was a trap,
and they led us right to it.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.289
Can you walk?

12:29.081 --> 12:30.666
They got a head start on us.

12:30.666 --> 12:32.251
It doesn't matter, we have the Wayfinder

12:32.251 --> 12:34.378
and even if they get lucky, we have guns.

12:34.378 --> 12:36.338
They are not leaving with that treasure.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.549
Okay. What do we do?

12:39.091 --> 12:41.635
- Go back to the boats? Get the police?
- No.

12:41.635 --> 12:44.680
We do that, they blow up the treasure
before the police get here.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.765
Right.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.017
We're gonna keep going
where the Wayfinder was pointing.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.643
We're gonna get to the treasure first,

12:49.643 --> 12:51.937
and we're gonna get out as much
as we can before they get there.

12:51.937 --> 12:52.897
Okay.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.151
What's that?

12:59.653 --> 13:01.530
It's a Mesoamerican statue.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.617
But which way?

13:04.617 --> 13:06.410
- Left or right?
- Uh...

13:06.410 --> 13:07.703
Okay.

13:08.245 --> 13:12.374
The Europeans considered left-handed
people evil and sinister.

13:12.374 --> 13:14.251
But the Mesoamericans believed

13:14.251 --> 13:18.339
that the left side of the body
was heavily charged with vital force.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.256
You're right.

13:19.256 --> 13:23.511
The god the Aztecs trusted the most
was Huitzilopochtli, which means...

13:23.511 --> 13:25.721
"left-handed hummingbird."

13:26.847 --> 13:27.890
Left it is.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.647
Any street signs yet?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.023
No, nothing that's marked.

13:37.191 --> 13:38.859
What's that?

13:38.859 --> 13:40.152
It's Ross's phone.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.156
I don't know how or why

13:44.156 --> 13:46.408
but an actual doctor
is calling her right now.

13:47.034 --> 13:47.952
What?

13:47.952 --> 13:48.911
Hello?

13:48.911 --> 13:51.622
Hey, Bets. The suspense is killing me.
Did you make your arrest?

13:51.622 --> 13:53.707
<i>Dr. Zeke, my name is Tasha Rivers.</i>

13:56.168 --> 13:57.419
And I need your help.

13:57.419 --> 13:58.754
<i>Please.</i>

14:05.386 --> 14:06.554
Looks like a shootout.

14:07.555 --> 14:08.889
Yeah, but between who?

14:09.515 --> 14:11.267
It's hard to tell.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.018
At least it wasn't Jess and her dad.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.229
Yet. We gotta find her.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.787
Left or right?

14:31.787 --> 14:33.289
What does the Wayfinder say?

14:33.289 --> 14:35.249
It's saying both ways.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.417
Why would it do that?

14:38.460 --> 14:40.087
Because it's a test.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.474
I know which way to go.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.314
They went that way.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.692
Sounds like Betsy's got
a tension pneumothorax.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.527
It doesn't sound good.

15:04.111 --> 15:07.406
Yeah, well, it's bad,
but we're gonna make her better.

15:07.406 --> 15:10.075
Look, I need you to listen
to everything I tell you, okay?

15:10.075 --> 15:11.869
Yeah, of course. You're a doctor.

15:11.869 --> 15:12.995
Actually, I'm a coroner.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.873
Aren't those the guys that,
that work on dead people?

15:15.873 --> 15:17.082
<i>Yeah, we are.</i>

15:18.375 --> 15:19.793
But I promise I know what I'm doing.

15:19.793 --> 15:22.546
Okay. Okay, Dr. Zeke. Let's do it.

15:22.546 --> 15:23.464
<i>Great.</i>

15:23.464 --> 15:24.924
You're gonna need
to stab Betsy in the chest

15:24.924 --> 15:26.091
with something sharp and hollow.

15:26.091 --> 15:29.094
<i>It'll relieve the pressure
and help her breathe.</i>

15:29.094 --> 15:30.721
<i>You can do this, right?</i>

15:33.474 --> 15:35.893
Yeah. Yes, yes, I can.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.895
Great. Find a pen.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.022
A pen. A pen, uh...

15:40.689 --> 15:41.607
Uh...

15:42.399 --> 15:44.860
I, I don't have a pen. I'm fully digital.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.237
I've got an eco-friendly metal straw.

15:47.237 --> 15:48.447
<i>Perfect.</i>

15:48.447 --> 15:50.616
Now, look, you're gonna have to be
very precise.

15:52.534 --> 15:53.661
Pull over.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.162
All right.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.853
We found it.

16:19.853 --> 16:23.565
No one has set eyes on this
since the Daughters of the Plumed Serpent.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.651
What are we waiting for?

16:26.902 --> 16:28.237
Jessita!

16:31.365 --> 16:32.199
No.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.120
We walked into a trap.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.372
We must've missed a coyote?

16:41.625 --> 16:43.919
- Well, help me lift it. Come on.
- Okay.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.391
Okay. Okay.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.643
I can see her collarbone, so now I just...

16:59.643 --> 17:01.437
<i>Just stab her right below it.</i>

17:01.437 --> 17:03.605
But, but whatever you do,
don't puncture her lung.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.149
Just out of curiosity.

17:05.149 --> 17:07.443
What happens
if we accidentally puncture her lung?

17:08.193 --> 17:09.403
She'll die.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.034
- I'm ready.
- <i>Great.</i>

17:15.034 --> 17:18.328
<i>I find it's best to center yourself
before making an incision.</i>

17:18.328 --> 17:20.956
<i>Take a deep breath, exhale, and--</i>

17:25.294 --> 17:27.296
Oh, my... I don't know...

17:27.296 --> 17:28.422
Oh!

17:28.422 --> 17:30.549
Oh, my god, it worked. It worked.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.009
Yes!

17:32.009 --> 17:33.093
Whoo!

17:33.093 --> 17:34.470
Sorry. Yeah.

17:34.470 --> 17:35.888
Oh, god.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.264
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my--

17:40.100 --> 17:43.228
Can I just tell you, you are
the biggest badass I have ever known?

17:43.228 --> 17:45.439
Oren, me? You were gonna jump
in front of a bullet for me.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.483
- I guess we're both badasses.
- Yeah.

17:48.942 --> 17:51.403
- Oh, my god. Are you okay?
- Okay.

17:55.949 --> 17:57.159
Ah, it's too heavy.

17:57.993 --> 18:00.412
Maybe we can saw through the bars
with the multitool.

18:00.412 --> 18:01.413
Good idea.

18:02.414 --> 18:03.582
No, I gave it to you.

18:03.582 --> 18:04.875
- You did?
- Yes.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.507
I must've dropped it
when we were running away.

18:12.466 --> 18:13.634
It's okay, come on.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.231
Any sign of the ambulance yet, Oren?

18:27.231 --> 18:29.274
They said they know
where we are now, right?

18:30.025 --> 18:31.110
Yeah.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.694
I'm gonna drive her
to the hospital myself.

18:32.694 --> 18:35.322
No, we can't do that.
Dr. Zeke says it's too dangerous.

18:35.322 --> 18:38.033
She's too unstable.
We have to wait for the paramedics.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.993
The bleeding's not stopping, is it?

18:39.993 --> 18:41.537
Don't you worry about that,
you're gonna be okay.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.038
There's an ambulance on its way.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.416
Agent Ross, I am so sorry.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.210
It's not your fault.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.421
I asked you to call me.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.592
You hear that?

18:55.592 --> 18:56.510
Over here!

18:57.845 --> 18:58.887
Over here!

18:59.888 --> 19:01.515
This way, over here!

19:12.985 --> 19:17.531
I can't believe we're gonna die
so close to finding the treasure.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.367
It's all my fault.

19:23.579 --> 19:24.997
I should have listened to your mom.

19:31.753 --> 19:34.214
She told me that this treasure hunt
was gonna ruin our lives.

19:34.923 --> 19:35.841
And it did.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.552
And you. You shouldn't even be here.

19:38.552 --> 19:41.471
You should have your whole life
in front of you.

19:42.139 --> 19:43.432
I was a fool.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.687
You don't get to take all the credit.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.029
I'm the one
that stole the boxes from Billie,

19:58.113 --> 19:59.865
then found you in prison.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.828
You'd still be there if it weren't for me.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.293
But I shouldn't have been in prison
in the first place.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.004
I should have been with you.

20:15.631 --> 20:16.715
And your mom.

20:20.886 --> 20:21.803
I missed it.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.226
I missed everything
that really mattered in life.

20:31.104 --> 20:32.731
I missed your first steps.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.108
Mom said I ate it.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.406
- Your first words?
- Mm, hmm.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.451
Mama.

20:48.455 --> 20:51.541
Your second word didn't happen
to be "papa," did it?

20:52.626 --> 20:54.711
<i>Caca.</i>

20:59.591 --> 21:00.759
I get it now.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.054
You were right.

21:06.431 --> 21:09.935
This treasure represents our families.

21:11.228 --> 21:12.604
Our heritage.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.984
My mom used to tell me stories about it.

21:20.153 --> 21:23.282
It was our family duty to protect it.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.079
And I failed her.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.580
That's not true.

21:34.501 --> 21:35.377
Billie's found us.

21:39.214 --> 21:40.549
- Jess?
- Jess?

21:40.549 --> 21:41.925
- Jess!
- Liam?

21:41.925 --> 21:43.635
Ethan!

21:47.180 --> 21:48.181
Hey.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.641
You both look strong.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.018
Maybe together we can lift
this thing up, right?

21:51.018 --> 21:52.185
- Okay, yeah.
- On three.

21:52.185 --> 21:53.979
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

21:58.191 --> 22:01.361
Okay. Okay, okay.

22:01.361 --> 22:03.030
We're gonna make a lever.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.323
Okay.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.160
Wait.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.661
Another coyote.

22:17.627 --> 22:18.712
Whoa.

22:19.713 --> 22:22.132
Okay. Coyote, bad.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.511
Let's see if it's safe now.

22:30.766 --> 22:31.850
No.

22:32.934 --> 22:35.270
Jess tricked us with that bracelet.

22:35.270 --> 22:36.688
We took the wrong path.

22:36.688 --> 22:37.773
We have to go back.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.907
Put it right there. Right on top.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.033
Okay. Watch out.

22:50.243 --> 22:52.704
Okay. You ready? Three, two, one. Go!

22:52.704 --> 22:53.789
- Come on!
- Go!

22:53.789 --> 22:54.915
Come on.

22:54.915 --> 22:55.999
It's working!

22:57.334 --> 22:58.668
Come on.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.215
Go!

23:03.840 --> 23:04.674
- Come on!
- Almost there, almost there.

23:04.674 --> 23:06.176
Go! Go, go, go!

23:08.845 --> 23:10.097
- Hold it.
- Okay.

23:12.307 --> 23:14.184
- Come on!
- Come on. Hurry!

23:19.314 --> 23:21.191
Hey, yeah. What's taking so long?

23:21.191 --> 23:22.526
My friends are in danger.

23:22.526 --> 23:23.527
I don't know.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.570
That's why we need a search team.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.531
Boats, choppers, dogs.

23:27.531 --> 23:28.740
I am calm!

23:30.283 --> 23:31.785
- <i>I got it.</i>
- Okay. Please just hurry.

23:31.785 --> 23:33.036
I'll call ahead.

23:35.288 --> 23:37.582
How, how long before
the search team gets here?

23:37.582 --> 23:38.667
Half hour, at least.

23:39.709 --> 23:41.753
All right, well, we can't wait here.
We gotta go help our crew.

23:41.753 --> 23:42.921
How?

23:42.921 --> 23:45.549
I don't know, maybe there's another boat
or something?

23:45.549 --> 23:47.467
But I can't just do nothing.
We gotta do something.

23:47.467 --> 23:48.593
All right, let's go.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.723
That's where the treasure is, huh?

23:53.723 --> 23:55.892
It's amazing it's still standing.

23:55.892 --> 23:57.602
If Billie and Salazar get to it,

23:57.602 --> 24:00.730
centuries of lost indigenous history
will be destroyed forever.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.400
How'd you know that?

24:03.400 --> 24:05.402
My grandpa figured it out.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.154
That's why they killed him.

24:07.154 --> 24:09.156
This cabal, they've been doing this
for centuries.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.699
Okay. We stick to the plan.

24:10.699 --> 24:11.867
We go in there.

24:11.867 --> 24:14.494
We get as much treasure out
before Billie and Salazar show up.

24:14.494 --> 24:15.454
Wait.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.498
If Tasha and Oren were able
to get to the cops,

24:19.082 --> 24:21.168
they'll only be able to bring them
to the dock.

24:21.751 --> 24:23.462
I have to go back and lead them here.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.754
Go back? We barely got here.

24:24.754 --> 24:27.299
I'll just go west, follow the setting sun

24:27.299 --> 24:28.675
until I hit a bank.

24:28.675 --> 24:30.177
There's a road not far from there.

24:31.386 --> 24:32.387
Boy Scout.

24:33.263 --> 24:34.264
Right.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.225
Be careful.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.644
One of us has to be.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.033
Billie, hold on. Hold on.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.203
I just need a second.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.124
No!

25:01.750 --> 25:02.876
No!

25:07.714 --> 25:09.090
She was a liability.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.637
Your brother
was pinned under rubble,

25:13.637 --> 25:15.430
begging for his life.

25:15.430 --> 25:17.015
Salazar stood above him.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.434
Called him a liability.

25:19.434 --> 25:21.269
And then he shot him.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.232
Rafael was right.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.235
You did kill my brother.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.778
The cause.

25:29.778 --> 25:32.322
The cause is the most important thing.

25:32.322 --> 25:33.698
Kacey was slowing us down.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.325
That's why she had to die.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.786
It's why Sebastian did, too.

25:39.663 --> 25:43.708
<i>Cras Est Nostrum</i> picked me to be Salazar.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.669
Because I make the hard calls.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.045
I earned that title.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.236
I'm Salazar now.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.988
<i>♪ Trying to make a mark ♪</i>

26:12.988 --> 26:15.574

26:24.666 --> 26:25.667

26:28.461 --> 26:29.671
Huh.

26:39.389 --> 26:40.473
Huitzilopochtli.

26:41.266 --> 26:43.351
Not only
is he the left-handed hummingbird,

26:43.351 --> 26:45.270
he's also the Aztec God of war.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.980
The supreme protector god.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.149
He's protecting the treasure.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.734
There must be a latch
or something in here.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.944
- Whoa, Dad!
- Ah!

26:52.944 --> 26:54.362
What are you doing?

26:55.488 --> 26:56.573
You called me "Dad."

26:57.157 --> 26:59.284
You said Huitzilopochtli
is the god of war.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.870
It could be a trap,
it could take your hand off.

27:03.288 --> 27:04.205
Good point.

27:04.998 --> 27:06.583
- I use my left.
- No, no, no!

27:08.877 --> 27:10.003
There's something in here.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.017
Yeah, it worked.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.105
Get inside!

27:36.029 --> 27:38.156
Come on, hurry. We gotta go.

27:41.785 --> 27:43.036
The door's shutting.

27:58.968 --> 28:01.304
The entrance to the treasure room.

28:03.556 --> 28:05.183
Could it be?

28:13.316 --> 28:14.359
Whoa.

28:23.952 --> 28:25.245
Those things are moving.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.497
Uh, is that good or bad?

28:27.497 --> 28:28.915
Definitely bad.

28:32.168 --> 28:33.420
Not another step.

28:35.338 --> 28:36.423
It's the Jaguar.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.133
He's protecting the treasure.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.926
We have to get past him.

28:39.926 --> 28:40.969
How?

28:40.969 --> 28:42.595
And every time we move, they move.

28:42.595 --> 28:44.013
There's just no way
we're gonna get to the door

28:44.013 --> 28:45.849
before those arrows are shot at us.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.272
It's a puzzle.

28:55.358 --> 28:56.526
It's your favorite thing.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.309
The Daughters of the Plumed Serpent

29:29.309 --> 29:32.979
used three distinct serpent symbols
to identify themselves.

29:32.979 --> 29:34.397
The rule of threes.

29:34.814 --> 29:35.774
Three boxes...

29:35.774 --> 29:37.150
Three tiles.

29:37.150 --> 29:39.235
Aztec, Inca, and Maya.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.322
That's the Incan symbol.

29:42.322 --> 29:43.531
On your side, Liam.

29:43.531 --> 29:45.116
Five tiles in front of you.

29:45.116 --> 29:46.409
Step on it.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.337
You're sure about this, Valenzuela?

29:59.005 --> 30:00.006
I am.

30:01.633 --> 30:02.634
Then I am too.

30:04.177 --> 30:05.345
Here goes nothing.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.266
They're not stopping.

30:10.266 --> 30:12.811
They won't
until we step on all three.

30:18.942 --> 30:20.276
The Mayan symbol

30:20.860 --> 30:22.570
- is closest to you, Dad.
- Oh, yeah.

30:22.570 --> 30:24.614
Four tiles to the right.

30:24.614 --> 30:26.157
It will take you two jumps.

30:50.598 --> 30:52.433
The Aztec is over there.

30:52.433 --> 30:54.310
That's a lot of steps.

31:07.824 --> 31:10.451
I don't think you have
more than one step left.

31:11.953 --> 31:12.996
Neither do I.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.041
You got this.

32:02.503 --> 32:05.131
- Can't see anything.
- There.

32:11.304 --> 32:12.430
What is it?

32:14.390 --> 32:15.642
I read about this.

32:15.642 --> 32:16.893
It's a lighting stone.

32:16.893 --> 32:17.977
It needs a light source.

32:18.561 --> 32:19.729
Help me turn this.

32:26.361 --> 32:27.445
It's a skylight.

33:09.278 --> 33:11.155
- Oh.
- Wow.

33:45.773 --> 33:46.816
I can't believe it.

33:48.651 --> 33:50.820
The Daughters of the Plumed Serpent
really did it.

33:52.321 --> 33:54.907
I wish my dad were...
and grandpa were here to see this.

33:58.870 --> 33:59.871
Look.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.254
It's Malinche.

34:08.254 --> 34:10.506
Your mom was right
about everything.

34:13.634 --> 34:14.969
Oh, this is amazing.

34:16.429 --> 34:18.139
We're locked in, wait.
How are we supposed to get all this out?

34:22.018 --> 34:23.728
There has to be a way to open this.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.378
This is personal now, Jess.

34:51.172 --> 34:53.508
You led me into those traps.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.344
Kacey is dead because of you.

35:00.556 --> 35:02.266
Now you...

35:04.644 --> 35:06.521
...and all this history...

35:08.022 --> 35:09.357
is going to burn.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.573
Put that down, Billie.

35:24.038 --> 35:25.331
Look out!

35:33.714 --> 35:35.466
I told you I was coming for you.

35:43.057 --> 35:44.600
Dad? No.

35:47.061 --> 35:49.188
Go.

35:50.773 --> 35:51.858
No.

35:54.443 --> 35:55.778
Aargh!

35:55.778 --> 35:57.864
No, no, no. No.

35:59.949 --> 36:01.117
Dad, wake up.

36:02.201 --> 36:04.203
Dad, please wake up.

36:06.873 --> 36:08.374
I never told you.

36:08.374 --> 36:10.668
You, you said you failed me.

36:10.668 --> 36:13.379
But you mattered to me my whole life.

36:15.214 --> 36:16.174
Papa?

36:17.008 --> 36:18.009
Please.

36:32.481 --> 36:34.150
You're alive!

36:34.150 --> 36:35.776
- Oh!
- I was afraid it was...

36:35.776 --> 36:37.278
...just a dream.

And I, uh...

41:17.766 --> 41:18.976
I found this tape.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.189

41:30.571 --> 41:32.114
It's all about the Pan-American treasure.
