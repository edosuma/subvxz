00:02.070 --> 00:03.437
Why are you acting so weird?

00:03.570 --> 00:05.820
Nicole says it's because I like you.

00:07.851 --> 00:10.110
- Don't you like me?
- Yeah, I do.

00:10.390 --> 00:12.204
My dad was notorious
for breaking promises.

00:12.324 --> 00:13.736
Don't wanna be that kind of father.

00:13.856 --> 00:15.758
You're not; you're a great father.

00:15.959 --> 00:17.042
My sister Jessi,

00:17.206 --> 00:18.731
she's been having some problems.

00:18.851 --> 00:20.622
We hope you might sit down with her.

00:20.742 --> 00:22.382
It's a really pretty necklace.

00:22.669 --> 00:25.067
Thanks. It's a remnant
from my Declan days.

00:26.769 --> 00:29.826
- Jessi, we're leaving.
- You can't tell me what to do!

00:34.074 --> 00:35.080
Foss!

00:38.774 --> 00:41.091
- I want to tell you everything.
- I'm ready to hear it.

00:43.458 --> 00:44.465
Foss did this?

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

01:05.880 --> 01:07.722
<i>you can't change the past.</i>

01:09.412 --> 01:11.061
<i>Lori had been attacked.</i>

01:11.181 --> 01:13.399
<i>No one was sure who did it or why.</i>

01:13.814 --> 01:17.987
<i>And all I could focus on was how
I wasn't able to stop it from happening.</i>

01:22.930 --> 01:23.937
Hey.

01:25.199 --> 01:27.420
Dad, you have to stop doing this.

01:28.786 --> 01:31.596
And you, do I speak
with a British accent?

01:32.185 --> 01:33.191
No.

01:33.632 --> 01:36.071
- Am I wearing a crown?
- No.

01:36.679 --> 01:40.317
Then stop guarding my door
like I'm Queen freakin' Elizabeth.

01:41.404 --> 01:42.410
Sorry.

01:46.768 --> 01:48.173
He's just worried about you.

01:48.344 --> 01:49.464
I gathered.

01:49.996 --> 01:53.224
Sweetie, I know you're just
trying to be strong, but

01:54.116 --> 01:56.499
what happened, it's a lot to deal with.

01:56.651 --> 01:58.995
What happened is I became one
with my inner liberal

01:59.128 --> 02:00.643
and got hate-crimed for it.

02:00.909 --> 02:03.624
As far as I'm concerned,
this is my badge of honor.

02:03.785 --> 02:05.133
How's she doing today?

02:05.332 --> 02:06.700
Apparently, better than I am.

02:07.020 --> 02:09.791
- When I look at her it breaks my heart.
- I feel the same way,

02:09.911 --> 02:13.216
but we have to keep it together,
and make her feel safe and comfortable.

02:13.336 --> 02:16.114
How about whipping up
some sympathy pancakes?

02:16.627 --> 02:19.133
What? She likes them
and I'm in the mood.

02:19.958 --> 02:21.458
I'll be right down.

02:24.625 --> 02:25.631
Me first.

02:27.074 --> 02:28.099
All yours.

02:31.612 --> 02:33.428
I hope that's the police
with news for Lori.

02:33.548 --> 02:35.870
I already spoke to them.
Still no leads or eye witnesses.

02:35.990 --> 02:39.362
And since Lori can't identify her
attacker, then they're at a dead end.

02:39.489 --> 02:40.932
A Dr. Keel is on the phone.

02:41.425 --> 02:42.469
Dr. Keel?

02:42.870 --> 02:45.547
She's calling from the hospital
about a patient:

02:45.720 --> 02:47.087
a William Trager.

02:48.625 --> 02:49.650
Who is he?

02:50.410 --> 02:51.729
He's my father.

02:52.109 --> 02:53.115
Hello.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.990
Yeah, this is his son.

02:56.156 --> 02:58.415
I didn't know Stephen's father
lived in town.

02:58.585 --> 03:00.104
How long has he been sick?

03:00.237 --> 03:02.259
I don't know.
They haven't spoken in years.

03:04.145 --> 03:05.495
It's complicated.

03:08.019 --> 03:09.899
He had a stroke last night.

03:10.670 --> 03:12.716
Looks like he's not going to make it.

03:12.836 --> 03:14.202
I'm so sorry, Stephen.

03:15.158 --> 03:17.408
Is there anything I can do to help?

03:18.133 --> 03:20.878
No, there's nothing to do. I said
good-bye to my father years ago.

03:26.074 --> 03:27.785
Are things really that bad between them?

03:28.706 --> 03:31.572
I always hoped they'd manage
to repair things, but

03:31.862 --> 03:33.579
doesn't look like
that's going to happen.

03:34.686 --> 03:37.292
<i>Adam Baylin said
I would touch the world,</i>

03:37.647 --> 03:39.731
but what good is having a gift
if I couldn't help

03:39.851 --> 03:41.785
the people I loved the most?

03:49.317 --> 03:51.589
<font color=#00FFFF>Season 2 Episode 8:
What's The Frequency, Kyle?</font>

03:57.528 --> 03:59.275
You didn't have to come.

04:00.318 --> 04:02.388
I know you told everyone not to,

04:02.653 --> 04:04.732
but I want to meet your father.

04:06.156 --> 04:08.559
He's in coma, you know?
He can't communicate.

04:08.705 --> 04:09.882
I understand.

04:15.929 --> 04:18.303
Been a long time since I've seen him.

04:19.461 --> 04:21.607
This wasn't how I envisioned
our next meeting.

04:22.671 --> 04:24.027
Would you rather go in alone?

04:26.275 --> 04:27.275
No.

04:45.372 --> 04:46.474
Mr. Trager.

04:47.366 --> 04:48.372
Yes?

04:48.885 --> 04:51.400
- I'm Dr. Keel.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

04:51.628 --> 04:52.729
- Hi.
- So,

04:53.185 --> 04:54.324
how's he doing?

04:54.818 --> 04:57.323
Well, I'm afraid there's
been no improvement.

04:57.551 --> 04:58.557
Can he hear us?

04:59.734 --> 05:01.623
This machine monitors
his neural patterns.

05:02.477 --> 05:04.793
The readings indicate that he can't.

05:09.692 --> 05:11.924
I'll give you some time with him.

05:18.568 --> 05:22.043
That's probably for the best
that he doesn't know I'm here.

05:23.175 --> 05:24.960
Do you really think that?

05:26.916 --> 05:29.517
Yeah. I was a big disappointment to him.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.966
He never agreed with
how I chose to live my life.

05:35.876 --> 05:37.319
Never listened...

05:39.009 --> 05:40.110
never cared.

05:47.039 --> 05:48.216
Are you okay?

05:49.548 --> 05:51.257
Yeah. I'm fine.

06:06.193 --> 06:08.589
God, how long were you standing there?

06:09.088 --> 06:10.095
Six seconds.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.930
I haven't seen you since you threw
that hissy fit at the dance.

06:14.063 --> 06:15.601
I got mad at my sister.

06:16.540 --> 06:18.552
Remind me never to cross you.

06:19.312 --> 06:20.508
So, what's up?

06:21.230 --> 06:23.451
Uh, I have a session
with your mom today.

06:25.198 --> 06:26.281
Oh, I get it.

06:26.432 --> 06:28.666
You came by for a damage report.

06:29.353 --> 06:30.359
Well...

06:34.356 --> 06:35.400
You look awful.

06:36.406 --> 06:37.830
Wow. Blunt.

06:38.770 --> 06:39.776
Does it hurt?

06:41.077 --> 06:42.577
Looks worse than it is.

06:42.700 --> 06:45.671
I just hope the cops
nail the bastard who did this.

06:45.880 --> 06:46.924
The police?

06:47.114 --> 06:49.851
You know, blue hats, shiny badges?

06:50.971 --> 06:52.281
Why would they be involved?

06:53.525 --> 06:56.419
Last time I checked the statutes,
assault was still a crime.

06:57.194 --> 06:58.200
A crime?

06:59.121 --> 07:00.127
Yeah.

07:01.146 --> 07:03.676
Plus, the creep who did this
stole the necklace Declan gave me

07:03.796 --> 07:05.054
and I want it back.

07:08.643 --> 07:10.580
So, are we done with 20 Questions?

07:11.614 --> 07:12.867
I only asked four.

07:15.089 --> 07:18.013
Right. Well, you don't want
to keep my mom waiting.

07:24.418 --> 07:26.345
What's up, baby? Come on, Declan.

07:26.474 --> 07:27.604
Let's move!

07:28.325 --> 07:29.587
Come on! Heads up!

07:29.902 --> 07:31.098
Come on, baby!

07:33.965 --> 07:35.474
- Game!
- Nice shot.

07:35.777 --> 07:37.277
Is that all you got?

07:42.191 --> 07:43.197
You okay?

07:43.909 --> 07:45.998
I didn't sleep much last night.

07:46.225 --> 07:47.592
How are you doing?

07:47.820 --> 07:50.193
You mean now that I know
the whole truth about you?

07:50.338 --> 07:53.604
I'll never look at science class
the same, that's for sure.

07:53.832 --> 07:55.423
I know it was a lot to take in.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.021
You can say that again.

07:57.153 --> 07:58.198
But don't.

08:00.162 --> 08:01.207
How's Lori?

08:03.352 --> 08:04.529
She's dealing.

08:05.061 --> 08:07.522
You should stop by.
I'm sure she'd appreciate it.

08:07.674 --> 08:09.810
I want to, but what about Foss?

08:10.432 --> 08:12.027
We can't be sure it was him.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.452
The cops cleared everyone
who was at The Rack,

08:14.585 --> 08:16.578
which can only mean one thing:

08:16.758 --> 08:18.448
your boy Foss is guilty.

08:19.559 --> 08:21.281
I just can't imagine he would go so far.

08:21.401 --> 08:23.240
Because he's such a model citizen.

08:23.410 --> 08:25.906
The guy's offed how many people
that we know about?

08:26.077 --> 08:29.891
So believing he can knock Lori around
is not that big a stretch.

08:31.993 --> 08:34.933
I should have seen it coming. I could
have done something to prevent it.

08:35.053 --> 08:36.796
Kyle, the guy's a frickin' psycho.

08:37.707 --> 08:39.905
You're not responsible for what he did.

08:41.292 --> 08:43.687
You haven't heard from him, have you?

08:44.275 --> 08:46.174
Not since he left last week.

08:46.782 --> 08:49.203
And I have no idea where to find him.

08:50.342 --> 08:52.977
What are you going to do
if he comes back?

08:53.528 --> 08:55.312
I have to figure that out.

08:55.787 --> 08:57.693
Meanwhile, you should check on Lori.

08:57.813 --> 09:00.109
At least for now I think it's safe.

09:04.258 --> 09:05.606
Lori seems fine.

09:07.111 --> 09:09.140
Well, appearances can be deceiving.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.077
What do you mean?

09:11.589 --> 09:14.499
Sometimes people project
what they want others to see,

09:14.621 --> 09:18.191
even if it's not an accurate
representation of who they are.

09:19.311 --> 09:21.651
We can be different
than who we appear to be?

09:27.016 --> 09:28.801
Are you writing that down?

09:29.636 --> 09:30.775
Not exactly.

09:31.858 --> 09:33.619
Sometimes I record what you say.

09:33.790 --> 09:36.680
Other times, just my thoughts
and impressions.

09:36.870 --> 09:37.876
About me?

09:38.512 --> 09:39.803
Well, yes.

09:40.638 --> 09:41.891
Can I read them?

09:42.612 --> 09:44.473
Jessi, they're confidential.

09:44.867 --> 09:46.063
You know that.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.505
Let's talk about Emily.

09:51.648 --> 09:54.648
Now, when she insisted
that you leave the dance,

09:54.836 --> 09:58.330
is that the way she normally behaves
when she's upset with you?

09:58.577 --> 09:59.583
I guess.

10:01.596 --> 10:04.027
I know everybody thinks she's so nice,

10:04.217 --> 10:05.394
but she's not.

10:06.535 --> 10:07.617
She just...

10:08.111 --> 10:09.326
appears to be.

10:11.130 --> 10:12.478
What do you mean?

10:13.915 --> 10:16.535
She's always saying
that she's in control...

10:16.706 --> 10:19.408
telling me where to go
and who to be with.

10:21.281 --> 10:24.319
Sometimes, I'm just
really scared around her.

10:37.645 --> 10:39.923
<i>Ever since my trip to the hospital,</i>

10:40.094 --> 10:42.031
<i>I felt like I was in a fog.</i>

10:42.619 --> 10:45.788
<i>But as my head cleared,
an image appeared in my mind.</i>

10:46.073 --> 10:48.873
<i>I didn't know what it was
or why I was drawing it.</i>

10:49.107 --> 10:51.163
<i>I just knew I had to get it out.</i>

10:59.211 --> 11:00.217
Dad?

11:00.616 --> 11:02.249
Hey, guys. What's up?

11:02.780 --> 11:04.696
We figured you weren't
feeling that great...

11:04.848 --> 11:06.509
Want to go to a movie or something?

11:06.629 --> 11:07.632
Our treat.

11:08.180 --> 11:10.364
Wait, you'll actually be seen
at a movie with me?

11:10.515 --> 11:13.966
At a time like this, I'm willing to risk
the embarrassment.

11:14.231 --> 11:16.168
So you're really okay, then?

11:16.472 --> 11:18.058
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

11:18.191 --> 11:21.535
Dad, your father's in the hospital.
My face will heal.

11:22.143 --> 11:25.681
Grandpa had a chance to be part
of our lives and he chose not to be.

11:25.849 --> 11:27.804
Do any of you recognize this?

11:28.934 --> 11:30.472
It's a church, dude.

11:30.671 --> 11:32.209
That's St. Augustine.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.136
How do you know that?

11:34.269 --> 11:35.878
My father belonged to the congregation.

11:35.998 --> 11:38.619
He wanted me and your mom
to get married there.

11:38.771 --> 11:40.138
Why did you draw this?

11:40.271 --> 11:42.048
I don't know, it just came to me.

11:42.219 --> 11:43.681
I must have seen it recently.

11:44.849 --> 11:48.169
You couldn't have. This church
was torn down years ago.

12:00.430 --> 12:02.498
No St. Augustine in this one, either.

12:02.669 --> 12:05.162
Well, he had to have seen it
in one of these.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.390
Check it out, our first apartment.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.497
Yeah, if you can call a basement sublet

12:11.649 --> 12:13.662
with bad plumbing and mice an apartment.

12:13.813 --> 12:14.953
Hey, I loved it.

12:15.085 --> 12:16.085
I did, too.

12:20.209 --> 12:22.051
Oh, you were so beautiful.

12:22.734 --> 12:26.213
I was afraid you were going
to wise up at the last minute.

12:26.403 --> 12:29.180
We could have gotten married
at the church, you know?

12:30.035 --> 12:32.160
I would have gone along with it.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.002
You remember how he was.

12:34.154 --> 12:37.381
He had to put his stamp on everything.
If I didn't make a stand with

12:37.514 --> 12:41.136
our wedding, he'd have barked religion
at us for the rest of our lives.

12:41.313 --> 12:43.561
Instead he just didn't come at all.

12:47.997 --> 12:50.171
I know we both made mistakes.

12:52.625 --> 12:54.980
Maybe you should try talking to him.

12:55.644 --> 12:59.135
I know he can't hear you,
but saying the words might be enough.

13:01.643 --> 13:03.560
I got nothing to say to him.

13:06.986 --> 13:09.758
Not a single picture of the church.
How the hell did Kyle draw this?

13:10.043 --> 13:12.322
My Grandfather sent Kyle the image.

13:12.512 --> 13:13.595
But he's in a coma.

13:13.955 --> 13:15.426
Like that's going to stop Kyle?

13:16.812 --> 13:18.821
Just when I'm ready
to cross "alien" off my list,

13:18.941 --> 13:21.508
you pull another stunt
and suck me back in.

13:22.211 --> 13:23.616
I don't do stunts.

13:24.281 --> 13:25.415
You know what I mean.

13:25.535 --> 13:27.471
Something unexplainable.

13:27.945 --> 13:29.161
It is explainable.

13:30.104 --> 13:31.282
I'm listening.

13:33.641 --> 13:35.454
Okay, I can't explain it... yet,

13:35.929 --> 13:38.820
but whatever it is, I'm sure there's
a logical scientific explanation.

13:38.953 --> 13:40.339
Don't be so sure.

13:41.461 --> 13:43.056
Maybe it's divine intervention.

13:43.227 --> 13:44.227
Boring.

13:44.917 --> 13:46.018
Divine intervention?

13:46.721 --> 13:49.373
Maybe God wants you to help Stephen
make peace with his father.

13:50.285 --> 13:51.823
Do you really think that's possible?

13:53.210 --> 13:54.842
With you, anything's possible.

14:04.127 --> 14:07.186
I really wish people
would stop sneaking up on me.

14:07.623 --> 14:08.623
Sorry.

14:09.332 --> 14:10.965
- How you doing?
- Fine.

14:11.098 --> 14:13.899
I never knew there were
so many shades of purple.

14:14.044 --> 14:15.297
You're painting your room?

14:15.449 --> 14:17.405
Time to change it up in here.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.286
Lori, seriously, are you okay?

14:19.765 --> 14:21.744
Did you expect to find me
in the fetal position?

14:21.915 --> 14:23.510
I- I wouldn't blame you.

14:23.985 --> 14:27.535
Look, some coward jumped me. I'm not
going to let him get the best of me.

14:27.671 --> 14:29.152
Well, that's great, but

14:29.475 --> 14:31.924
I also think you can let yourself
freak out a little.

14:33.170 --> 14:35.638
Are you going
to Preston's party this week?

14:35.878 --> 14:37.852
Thinking about it. Are you?

14:38.512 --> 14:41.924
I'm sure everyone's expecting me
to hide, but I'm going.

14:42.551 --> 14:45.072
- You su...
- Maybe I'll see you there.

14:59.077 --> 15:00.501
I hate hospitals.

15:00.965 --> 15:02.808
They're always so cold.

15:03.096 --> 15:05.583
The colder temperature helps
prevent the spread of viruses.

15:06.587 --> 15:08.391
The least they could do
is paint the walls,

15:08.830 --> 15:10.330
make it feel warmer.

15:13.572 --> 15:15.870
Was it difficult to see
your father this way?

15:17.623 --> 15:18.788
How did you...

15:20.823 --> 15:22.760
Oh, yeah, you're you.

15:26.981 --> 15:28.974
Do you think he knows we're here?

15:29.172 --> 15:30.671
The doctor said no.

15:31.201 --> 15:33.786
He can't be sure, right?
I mean if you received a message...

15:33.939 --> 15:35.123
But did I?

15:35.875 --> 15:37.599
I want to believe I can do this, but...

15:37.719 --> 15:40.621
Sometimes things happen
that just don't make sense.

15:40.879 --> 15:44.058
You've got to have faith that
they're happening for a reason.

15:48.169 --> 15:49.173
Hey.

15:49.293 --> 15:51.299
What are you two doing in here?

15:52.343 --> 15:53.670
I know it sounds crazy,

15:54.503 --> 15:56.022
but when I drew that church...

15:57.126 --> 16:00.787
What if your father's trying to
communicate something through me?

16:00.982 --> 16:03.241
And you're here waiting
for him to communicate again?

16:03.393 --> 16:06.936
I asked Kyle to try, Mr. Trager.
I thought if your father's reaching out

16:07.069 --> 16:08.777
- in some way...
- Listen...

16:08.974 --> 16:10.211
I know you two both mean well,

16:10.363 --> 16:13.429
but my father had plenty of chances
to reach out and make amends.

16:14.733 --> 16:16.345
What if he wants one more chance?

16:17.429 --> 16:19.182
There are no more chances.

16:19.390 --> 16:20.931
At least not for us.

16:34.470 --> 16:36.235
Thanks for taking the time.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.631
I know how hard it must be
trying to balance work and

16:38.808 --> 16:40.649
raise Jessi by yourself.

16:42.128 --> 16:43.419
Well, we manage.

16:44.108 --> 16:46.610
Still, it must get stressful at times.

16:48.749 --> 16:50.807
Nicole, what are you getting at?

16:52.111 --> 16:56.493
Jessi's expressed some anxiety to me
about the way you deal with her.

16:57.070 --> 17:00.828
And I saw the dynamic myself
when you showed up at the dance.

17:02.825 --> 17:04.023
The dynamic.

17:05.527 --> 17:08.005
You seem to get very
hostile and aggressive.

17:09.050 --> 17:11.690
I asked her not to go, she did anyway.

17:13.243 --> 17:16.415
Do you always react that
way when she doesn't listen?

17:17.642 --> 17:19.722
You know, I have to say I thought

17:19.855 --> 17:22.419
that Jessi would be making
more progress by now.

17:23.613 --> 17:25.077
I think she is.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.614
She's finally starting
to open up to me, and

17:27.785 --> 17:30.220
apparently, that makes
you uncomfortable...

17:30.620 --> 17:32.933
and that makes me even more concerned.

17:33.836 --> 17:35.844
There's no reason for concern.

17:41.193 --> 17:44.069
But I think I made a mistake
bringing Jessi to you.

17:44.318 --> 17:47.128
I think it's vital that
she continue coming.

17:47.550 --> 17:49.448
In fact, if Jessi misses
even one appointment,

17:49.580 --> 17:52.219
I won't hesitate to call
Social Services.

18:00.566 --> 18:03.345
<i>We can be different
than who we appear to be.</i>

18:04.078 --> 18:05.421
Are you writing that down?

18:06.211 --> 18:07.227
Not exactly.

18:35.845 --> 18:37.875
"Jessi lacks empathy...

18:38.724 --> 18:41.736
is socially manipulative,
and has no remorse."

18:45.886 --> 18:46.890
Hey.

18:48.233 --> 18:49.241
Hi.

18:49.913 --> 18:51.204
Sorry it took me so long.

18:51.356 --> 18:54.114
This guy in line changed
his order, like, 60 times.

18:54.342 --> 18:55.675
That's a lot of orders.

18:55.846 --> 18:56.853
Yeah.

18:59.275 --> 19:00.453
What's wrong?

19:01.103 --> 19:02.110
What do you mean?

19:02.243 --> 19:05.205
Well, I don't think the coffee
is what's bothering you.

19:08.762 --> 19:09.769
It's just...

19:09.940 --> 19:12.066
- I saw Lori earlier.
- So?

19:13.674 --> 19:15.761
Seeing her all beat up like that...

19:15.895 --> 19:17.947
She's trying to convince
herself it's no big deal.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.625
- Maybe it isn't to her.
- How couldn't it be?

19:21.782 --> 19:23.358
Think how you'd feel if you were her.

19:23.655 --> 19:26.712
You get attacked and you
don't know why or by who.

19:30.054 --> 19:32.938
I guess I never thought about
how it'd make her feel.

19:39.164 --> 19:41.370
<i>Adam told me that as my mind developed,</i>

19:41.586 --> 19:43.845
<i>new abilities would reveal
themselves to me,</i>

19:44.035 --> 19:45.717
<i>like holographic memory.</i>

19:46.288 --> 19:47.826
<i>But this was different.</i>

19:48.087 --> 19:50.019
<i>The church wasn't my memory;</i>

19:50.208 --> 19:51.831
<i>it was someone else's.</i>

19:52.708 --> 19:54.170
<i>If this was a new ability,</i>

19:54.395 --> 19:56.217
<i>why couldn't I control it?</i>

19:56.377 --> 19:57.723
<i>And if it wasn't,</i>

19:57.913 --> 20:00.116
<i>how could it be happening at all?</i>

20:59.676 --> 21:01.671
It's my father's living room.

21:03.135 --> 21:04.461
This is incredible.

21:04.581 --> 21:06.629
It's exactly how I remember it.

21:07.094 --> 21:08.469
How did you do this?

21:09.419 --> 21:10.463
I wish I knew.

21:17.953 --> 21:20.067
There's something I want you to see.

21:21.303 --> 21:23.733
- You grew up here?
- Yeah, sure did.

21:28.669 --> 21:31.555
Been a long time since
I've been in this house.

21:33.117 --> 21:34.641
Nothing has changed.

21:52.819 --> 21:55.467
Every night he'd pour himself
a glass of Scotch,

21:55.904 --> 21:57.290
sit in this chair,

21:58.405 --> 21:59.867
and read his bible.

22:03.618 --> 22:05.422
Put it ahead of everything,
even his family.

22:07.710 --> 22:09.727
Is that why you don't like religion?

22:09.922 --> 22:11.727
It's not that I don't like religion.

22:11.912 --> 22:13.033
It's just...

22:13.905 --> 22:16.263
that I'm a science guy.
I need hard evidence,

22:16.775 --> 22:17.782
proof.

22:19.156 --> 22:21.398
My father, he never understood that.

22:25.685 --> 22:29.972
Strange how something meant to bring
people together can split so many apart.

22:35.583 --> 22:36.969
I wrote him a letter

22:37.127 --> 22:38.987
after the kids were born...

22:39.861 --> 22:42.044
hoping he'd want to
be part of our family.

22:43.701 --> 22:47.366
When I came here to give it to
him, we had this huge argument.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.673
He tore it up right in front of me.

22:55.228 --> 22:56.719
Never even read it.

22:58.822 --> 23:00.284
Was that the last time you spoke?

23:03.820 --> 23:06.801
We both said some
horrible things to each other.

23:07.765 --> 23:10.172
I have always regretted
the way we left it.

23:14.334 --> 23:17.164
So if he's really trying
to say something,

23:18.732 --> 23:20.004
I'm ready to listen.

23:23.236 --> 23:26.324
I need to talk to Ballantine,
so I'm just going in.

23:26.921 --> 23:29.636
Nicole Trager's threatened
to call Social Services on me.

23:29.810 --> 23:32.050
- Why would she do that?
- It's Jessi.

23:32.250 --> 23:34.072
She's been willful and defiant.

23:34.306 --> 23:36.717
She must be complaing about
me during her therapy sessions.

23:36.853 --> 23:40.404
She's a computer with a glitch.
Bring her in. We'll fix her.

23:41.701 --> 23:44.680
With all due respect,
I don't think that that's a solution.

23:46.704 --> 23:48.720
You may have downloaded
a history into her brain,

23:48.840 --> 23:50.481
but I've been living with that girl.

23:50.666 --> 23:53.989
And she has wants and desires
and feelings like any other teenager.

23:54.142 --> 23:55.908
She's not like any other teenager.

23:56.228 --> 23:59.266
But you can't just reboot
her every time she acts like one.

23:59.465 --> 24:00.710
Ms. Hollander,

24:01.836 --> 24:03.583
that's not your concern.

24:05.133 --> 24:06.136
Look,

24:06.481 --> 24:09.272
I don't think I'm the right
person for this assignment.

24:09.526 --> 24:11.861
You know, you won't tell me
what we're really doing here,

24:11.982 --> 24:15.262
it's taking a lot longer than you led
me to believe, and I miss my little...

24:19.267 --> 24:21.413
I think it'd be best if I resigned.

24:23.783 --> 24:24.813
You're stressed out.

24:26.028 --> 24:27.737
It's a tough assignment.

24:28.564 --> 24:32.172
And now that you're so familiar with our
agenda I expect you to see it through.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.346
Take a few days to reconsider.

24:43.183 --> 24:44.764
We'd hate to lose you.

25:02.277 --> 25:04.097
Brought your bible for you, Dad.

25:05.214 --> 25:06.518
Thought you'd want it with you.

25:15.845 --> 25:17.234
What are you doing...

25:18.058 --> 25:19.058
exactly?

25:19.476 --> 25:21.136
Trying to focus on your father.

25:26.471 --> 25:27.516
Anything?

25:29.041 --> 25:30.062
Not yet.

25:41.718 --> 25:43.453
Hey, I was heading out for some coffee.

25:43.573 --> 25:45.271
I thought you might want to come along.

25:45.873 --> 25:48.898
Thanks, I'm already pretty deep
into the Lori Trager trifecta.

25:49.660 --> 25:51.123
You have a trifecta?

25:51.762 --> 25:52.992
Trashy magazines,

25:53.225 --> 25:54.516
nail polish,

25:54.873 --> 25:56.201
Oprah reruns.

25:59.281 --> 26:01.961
I know what you're thinking,
but I'm not here to analyze.

26:02.237 --> 26:05.281
You don't have a shrink speech
prepared for this scenario?

26:06.289 --> 26:08.515
I don't have a mom speech
prepared for this, either.

26:09.787 --> 26:12.701
I never thought I'd have to see you
deal with anything like this.

26:13.525 --> 26:15.516
But I know you'll get through it,

26:16.033 --> 26:17.226
and I know you need time,

26:18.249 --> 26:20.977
and you should know your dad
and I are here for you if you need us.

26:21.097 --> 26:22.121
Touching.

26:23.964 --> 26:25.065
What are you doing?

26:25.185 --> 26:27.173
Taking my Kyle File digital.

26:27.300 --> 26:29.521
Going to go videotape
the collage he drew on his wall.

26:29.657 --> 26:32.657
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
How do you think he did that?

26:37.134 --> 26:38.364
I gotta go.

26:44.413 --> 26:45.852
Do you know what this means?

26:47.289 --> 26:48.765
You're actually doing it.

26:48.912 --> 26:50.843
You're really communicating with him.

26:51.531 --> 26:54.494
But what's a church and
an old room supposed to tell me?

26:54.864 --> 26:56.708
Maybe there's more to the message.

26:57.396 --> 26:58.847
I tried and got nothing.

26:59.584 --> 27:02.683
Stephen's finally ready to listen
and I'm letting him down.

27:04.135 --> 27:05.844
When my dad was alive,

27:06.643 --> 27:10.061
we used to sit in the gardens
at Lancaster Park and talk for hours.

27:10.842 --> 27:13.822
He always told me
I could do anything if I just believed.

27:14.818 --> 27:16.097
But what if I fail?

27:16.625 --> 27:17.744
You won't.

27:18.236 --> 27:19.822
How can you be so sure?

27:20.389 --> 27:21.594
Because...

27:22.062 --> 27:23.217
I believe in you.

27:32.672 --> 27:33.828
about the dance,

27:34.971 --> 27:36.828
it didn't really end the way I'd hoped.

27:37.430 --> 27:38.430
I know.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.025
With Lori and everything.

27:41.131 --> 27:42.139
Yes.

27:43.504 --> 27:44.684
With us, too.

27:47.487 --> 27:49.147
The timing wasn't right.

27:51.385 --> 27:52.578
When will it be?

27:59.384 --> 28:00.601
We'll just know.

28:28.256 --> 28:29.350
What is it?

28:30.715 --> 28:32.805
I don't know what's wrong with me.

28:35.104 --> 28:38.240
Nothing's wrong with you;
you're just confused.

28:39.236 --> 28:40.908
I lack empathy,

28:41.203 --> 28:42.863
I'm socially manipulative,

28:42.986 --> 28:44.535
and I have no remorse.

28:46.961 --> 28:48.584
Did Nicole tell you that?

28:49.199 --> 28:51.215
I just want things to make sense.

28:51.412 --> 28:54.128
I want to understand
why I do the things I do.

28:56.674 --> 28:57.719
You know...

28:59.342 --> 29:01.432
everyone feels that way sometimes.

29:01.748 --> 29:02.903
Do you?

29:03.960 --> 29:05.005
Sure.

29:14.952 --> 29:17.546
Do you remember what
Mom used to say about tomorrow?

29:18.543 --> 29:19.543
Mom?

29:21.420 --> 29:22.441
She said,

29:23.252 --> 29:25.170
"Tomorrow's a clean slate,

29:26.142 --> 29:29.179
"a chance to correct your mistakes
and become a better person. "

29:30.949 --> 29:32.111
I want that.

29:33.059 --> 29:34.596
I want to change.

29:47.537 --> 29:49.000
Don't stay up too late.

30:18.163 --> 30:19.528
<i>What was I missing,</i>

30:19.700 --> 30:21.065
<i>not seeing?</i>

30:21.877 --> 30:24.053
<i>I didn't know the answer
and time was running out.</i>

30:28.762 --> 30:30.421
What are you trying to tell me?

30:35.635 --> 30:36.920
Hi, it's Emily Hollander.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.919
I thought I'd stop by
and surprise Paige.

30:39.039 --> 30:40.529
Has my mother picked her up yet?

30:40.649 --> 30:44.056
<i>Ms. Hollander, the gentleman
from your office picked Paige up early.</i>

30:44.609 --> 30:47.600
<i>- What?
- Yes, they left about half an hour ago.</i>

30:47.748 --> 30:50.170
What gentleman? Who authorized that?

30:50.496 --> 30:51.590
<i>You did.</i>

31:06.237 --> 31:07.237
Mom.

31:08.008 --> 31:10.762
- Emily, what's wrong?
- Someone picked up Paige from school.

31:10.885 --> 31:12.803
I know that. She's here.

31:12.987 --> 31:14.229
Mommy, you're home!

31:14.401 --> 31:16.504
Oh, God, sweetie, Paige!

31:16.664 --> 31:17.992
Oh, you're okay.

31:20.610 --> 31:21.987
Mom, how did she get here?

31:22.110 --> 31:24.417
Nice young man from Madacorp
dropped her off.

31:24.540 --> 31:27.516
And he said to tell you that Madacorp
always has your family in mind.

32:40.656 --> 32:42.426
Back to your old tricks, huh?

32:42.574 --> 32:44.233
Thought you might get a kick out of it.

32:47.590 --> 32:48.623
So...

32:49.041 --> 32:50.074
you're not painting.

32:50.209 --> 32:52.238
I decided I like it the way it is.

32:53.185 --> 32:54.193
Me, too.

32:55.791 --> 32:57.132
What are you doing here?

32:57.685 --> 32:59.738
I had a feeling you might
not be up to going.

33:01.078 --> 33:02.677
Major chick flicks.

33:04.041 --> 33:05.062
You didn't have to.

33:05.517 --> 33:06.586
I wanted to.

33:07.312 --> 33:09.808
Just don't tell anyone
you saw me with those.

33:16.430 --> 33:17.451
Well,

33:17.906 --> 33:20.168
I guess I'll leave you to your Kleenex.

33:20.709 --> 33:21.828
Actually...

33:24.385 --> 33:26.168
would you mind sticking
around for a while?

33:31.676 --> 33:32.906
Only if...

33:36.053 --> 33:37.430
I can finally hear your song.

34:11.387 --> 34:12.960
You never give up, do you?

34:14.744 --> 34:16.109
I don't want to,

34:16.268 --> 34:19.391
but I'm starting to think we'll
never know what he's trying to tell us.

34:20.862 --> 34:23.217
It's certainly not from lack of effort,
that's for sure.

34:29.560 --> 34:30.690
What's that?

34:33.077 --> 34:35.768
I keep seeing the numbers
15 and 11 in my head.

34:36.581 --> 34:38.614
Those are all things
associated with them:

34:39.389 --> 34:40.471
dates,

34:40.606 --> 34:43.150
formulas,
elements of the Periodic Table.

34:46.397 --> 34:47.725
15 and 11.

34:49.926 --> 34:51.960
Do those numbers mean anything to you?

34:53.264 --> 34:55.342
Yeah, Luke 15 verse 11.

34:56.879 --> 34:58.170
The Prodigal Son.

34:58.650 --> 35:01.024
It's my dad's favorite passage
in the bible.

35:15.796 --> 35:16.805
What?

35:17.780 --> 35:18.862
What is it?

35:32.310 --> 35:33.404
It's my letter.

35:37.425 --> 35:38.519
He read it.

35:42.651 --> 35:43.905
You really did it.

35:46.979 --> 35:49.044
This is what he's been
trying to tell me.

35:56.162 --> 35:57.798
I heard you, Dad.

36:15.682 --> 36:17.029
Nicole told me.

36:17.785 --> 36:18.805
I'm sorry.

36:20.637 --> 36:22.432
Yeah, he died late last night.

36:26.330 --> 36:29.428
You know, I was thinking about
the last time I spoke to him,

36:29.920 --> 36:31.801
how angry we both were,

36:33.375 --> 36:35.724
when I realized somewhere alone
the way that...

36:36.990 --> 36:38.662
I wasn't angry anymore.

36:40.051 --> 36:41.342
I was afraid.

36:42.123 --> 36:43.123
Of what?

36:44.705 --> 36:45.984
That he didn't care.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.254
But he did.

36:49.770 --> 36:51.368
Yeah, he did.

36:58.131 --> 36:59.569
I want to thank you.

37:01.856 --> 37:03.111
What you did...

37:07.832 --> 37:09.947
You've made such
a difference in my life.

37:11.139 --> 37:13.193
I'm very happy that you're here.

37:14.754 --> 37:15.849
Me, too.

37:29.237 --> 37:30.798
Okay, what's your problem?

37:32.089 --> 37:33.183
Don't have one.

37:33.552 --> 37:35.617
You've been avoiding me all week.

37:35.839 --> 37:36.839
No, I haven't.

37:37.130 --> 37:41.409
Seriously, you haven't made one snarky,
wise-ass comment to me in days.

37:41.839 --> 37:44.004
I'm coming up with some new material

37:44.139 --> 37:46.155
and I'm not ready to launch it.

37:47.016 --> 37:49.647
Please, as if you have
a self-editing bone in your body.

37:53.820 --> 37:55.560
I'm going to talk about
my feelings, here.

37:55.721 --> 37:57.478
So bear with me if I am

37:57.638 --> 37:59.359
a little less articulate than usual.

37:59.531 --> 38:01.929
I'm not really into the whole
touchy-feely movement.

38:02.236 --> 38:03.564
That's more like it.

38:06.343 --> 38:07.400
It's just...

38:08.175 --> 38:10.277
every time I look at your eye,

38:10.782 --> 38:11.827
the bruises,

38:12.712 --> 38:14.716
I get so mad.

38:15.757 --> 38:17.697
All I wanna do is find the guy
who did this and

38:17.845 --> 38:19.677
beat the hell out of him.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.653
It's my job as your brother
to protect you.

38:23.022 --> 38:24.972
It's one thing if
I push you around, but...

38:25.095 --> 38:26.219
no one else can.

38:26.706 --> 38:28.431
Not if I have anything to say about it.

38:32.129 --> 38:33.604
That make any sense?

38:36.604 --> 38:37.723
Not in public.

38:39.912 --> 38:40.912
And...

38:41.793 --> 38:42.793
one other thing.

38:44.326 --> 38:45.703
Hilary Duff called.

38:46.134 --> 38:47.351
She wants her shirt back.

38:55.781 --> 38:58.510
- Trager.
- So we're back to that, huh?

38:58.731 --> 38:59.949
For old time's sake.

39:00.858 --> 39:02.912
It's good to see you
with a smile on your face.

39:03.477 --> 39:05.063
I've been told it suits me.

39:06.929 --> 39:08.346
Hey, you heading to Miller's class?

39:08.482 --> 39:10.928
Yeah. Just let me
put my stuff in my locker.

39:14.408 --> 39:15.945
This is totally not funny.

39:16.768 --> 39:17.899
What is it?

39:18.354 --> 39:20.051
It's my necklace that was stolen.

39:24.367 --> 39:26.186
Why did we come to your office?

39:26.346 --> 39:27.945
To get you some help.

39:28.363 --> 39:29.555
Nicole's here?

39:30.391 --> 39:32.801
I don't think she's been
a good match for you.

39:33.551 --> 39:35.235
You remember Mr. Ballantine?

39:36.194 --> 39:39.010
- Hi.
- Hello, Jessi. Nice to see you again.

39:39.538 --> 39:42.329
- What's this about?
- I'll explain everything to you.

39:42.612 --> 39:43.657
Please.

39:44.875 --> 39:46.646
It's okay, Jessi, I'll be right here.

39:56.106 --> 39:57.790
You made the right choice.

39:58.184 --> 40:00.759
Don't worry, we'll take
good care of her.

40:01.460 --> 40:04.066
It's time for you to concentrate
on Stephen Trager.

40:28.649 --> 40:29.694
It's beautiful.

40:31.907 --> 40:33.321
How'd you know I was here?

40:34.649 --> 40:36.715
It's where you used to come
with your father.

40:44.487 --> 40:46.614
I heard what happened to Stephen's dad.

40:49.061 --> 40:50.069
I'm sorry.

40:51.827 --> 40:53.395
I couldn't have helped him without you.

40:53.515 --> 40:56.056
- Yes, you could.
- You wouldn't let me give up.

40:57.347 --> 40:58.712
And I'm glad you didn't.

41:00.513 --> 41:01.927
You did a great thing.

41:03.255 --> 41:05.468
You gave Stephen a chance
to say good-bye.

41:07.214 --> 41:08.972
A lot of people never get that.

41:12.426 --> 41:13.520
Like you.

41:18.155 --> 41:19.790
When my dad first got sick,

41:21.217 --> 41:22.741
I thought everything would be fine,

41:23.749 --> 41:25.212
that he'd get through it.

41:26.849 --> 41:29.259
I just couldn't imagine
a world without him in it.

41:31.325 --> 41:34.411
By the time I got the courage
to go see him at the hospital,

41:35.788 --> 41:38.629
he was so out of it
they said he couldn't hear me.

41:40.608 --> 41:42.108
And I believed them.

41:44.985 --> 41:46.670
But after seeing what you did...

41:48.391 --> 41:49.928
I know they were wrong.

41:51.833 --> 41:53.223
He could hear me.

42:00.760 --> 42:02.530
So, did you ever solve how you did it?

42:04.595 --> 42:05.726
Not really.

42:06.943 --> 42:10.926
But I thought about what you said,
that some things science can't explain.

42:11.971 --> 42:13.397
What I realized was that...

42:14.479 --> 42:17.467
it doesn't matter
how it happened or even why.

42:19.544 --> 42:21.216
What matters is it did.

42:26.246 --> 42:27.549
What's that look?

42:29.369 --> 42:30.771
You're the mind-reader.

42:32.062 --> 42:33.193
You tell me.
