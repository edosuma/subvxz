01:57.970 --> 01:59.730
Give up. Give up, I said.

02:01.300 --> 02:02.590
Get out of my face.

02:06.390 --> 02:08.080
Move it. Move it.

02:09.389 --> 02:10.720
Fuck you up!

02:15.150 --> 02:16.820
Break it up!

02:34.740 --> 02:36.500
Come on, back off.
Take your hands off me.

02:52.980 --> 02:54.070
Take this, take this!

03:12.830 --> 03:14.620
Tell me, Twitch.

03:15.510 --> 03:17.540
- Who started this?
- My name's Twitch...

03:17.660 --> 03:21.190
...and I ain't no snitch.
I don't know nothing, man.

03:21.690 --> 03:23.350
You're worried?

03:23.830 --> 03:25.630
About them?

03:26.940 --> 03:29.170
What they could do to you?

03:29.880 --> 03:31.980
You should worry more about me.

03:32.090 --> 03:35.760
- And what I'm gonna do to you.
- Look, man, I'm just working.

03:35.810 --> 03:37.670
Just doing my time.

03:37.790 --> 03:39.920
Just doing my time.

03:41.410 --> 03:43.840
Model citizen.

03:44.610 --> 03:47.510
See, Twitch has been here
a long time...

03:47.580 --> 03:49.740
...seen lot of shit go down.

03:49.850 --> 03:53.050
Like inmates trying to take over.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.780
But I slapped them down
like little bitches.

03:56.830 --> 03:59.920
Nobody wins in my island...

04:00.000 --> 04:01.300
...but me.

04:03.870 --> 04:06.600
What do you think, homeys?

04:06.690 --> 04:10.050
Should I put any of you in the hole?

04:10.110 --> 04:11.940
Shit.

04:12.070 --> 04:14.900
Lot of guys like you in the hole...

04:14.980 --> 04:17.570
...guys who think they're tough...

04:18.269 --> 04:21.670
...guys who are beginning
to believe...

04:21.730 --> 04:24.360
...they're bigger...

04:24.450 --> 04:26.650
...than my island.

04:32.290 --> 04:34.520
You bay beauties...

04:34.630 --> 04:38.060
...you don't know
how fucking good you got it.

04:38.120 --> 04:39.580
Hey...

04:39.720 --> 04:41.410
...bag of bones.

04:41.990 --> 04:45.430
You wouldn't last two weeks
in a place like Creighton.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.270
- Toughest max- security joint...
- Creigh- -?

04:47.400 --> 04:49.330
...in the country.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.060
In case you never heard of it.

04:52.870 --> 04:55.170
It's where society took a shit.

04:55.270 --> 04:58.670
And built a 40- foot wall around it.

04:58.730 --> 05:02.390
And any of you could end up there...

05:02.440 --> 05:05.430
...with a snap of my fingers.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.980
So...

05:08.100 --> 05:11.040
...everybody's on notice.

05:11.110 --> 05:13.910
Whoever starts the next fight...

05:14.570 --> 05:19.440
...gets a free ride, no questions asked,
to Creighton.

05:19.430 --> 05:25.130
Then you can see
how bad you really are.

05:26.380 --> 05:28.400
Now, get them back to their cages.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.790
They're starting to give me
indigestion.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.970
Come on, line it up and let's move.

05:38.190 --> 05:40.490
Lock your chains. Let's go.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.560
- That means you too.
- Back it up.

05:43.630 --> 05:45.650
Creighton, huh?
That's in Missouri, ain't it?

06:01.070 --> 06:02.660
Hey, Twitch.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.030
Heard you got deep- sixed
at your parole hearing.

06:05.130 --> 06:08.130
Looks like you're not getting out
anytime soon.

06:08.210 --> 06:10.510
Oh, fuck you, Hubert.

06:10.610 --> 06:13.940
I'm out in a month.
Mark it on your calendar.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.470
While you rot in here, I get the gold.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.690
Yeah, I'll be out a lot sooner
than you think.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.400
Oh, yeah? You gonna dog paddle
off this rock?

06:21.490 --> 06:25.590
- Oh, I got ways.
- A month, Twitch. That's what I got.

06:25.620 --> 06:28.590
Yeah? And I got a nice,
stern ass- whupping for you...

06:28.660 --> 06:31.460
...if you don't leave me
the fuck alone.

06:38.390 --> 06:39.950
You.

06:40.310 --> 06:42.100
You're gonna move, man?
Wanna move a play?

06:42.230 --> 06:43.490
No.

06:44.440 --> 06:45.730
Shit.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.000
Perfect.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.750
Hey. What's up, motherfucker?

06:51.830 --> 06:54.800
- I'm talking to you, motherfucker.
- What do you want, Twitch?

06:54.870 --> 06:56.890
I wanna kick your ass.

06:57.010 --> 07:00.180
- Man, come on, get your ass up.
- You can't be serious.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.650
Nigga, you've been talking shit
about me.

07:02.740 --> 07:03.900
When? What proof you got?

07:04.050 --> 07:06.890
I don't need no proof.
Man, you sound like a lawyer.

07:06.970 --> 07:09.130
How can you see with these
motherfuckers on here- -

07:09.240 --> 07:11.230
- Give them back.
- Fuck, no.

07:11.350 --> 07:15.080
Why don't you come get them from me
so I could kick your ass?

07:15.130 --> 07:16.460
You know I'm out in a month.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.830
- I'm not gonna fight you.
- Damn.

07:20.380 --> 07:23.440
- But my bitch will.
- What bitch?

07:24.920 --> 07:27.860
Oh, shit. Okay.
Here. Hey, you gotta- -

07:33.210 --> 07:34.730
Come here.

07:35.230 --> 07:36.850
- Fuck, yeah.
- Oh, shit.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.020
Get up and walk.
Get up and walk.

07:50.140 --> 07:52.470
- What was that?
- Easy, easy.

07:52.570 --> 07:54.370
- Get up.
- I'll kick your ass.

07:54.490 --> 07:57.720
You make sure you tell the warden
that I started this, you hear me?

07:57.790 --> 08:01.090
You hear me? You tell- -  What the fuck
are you- -? I'll kick your ass too.

08:24.830 --> 08:28.170
Good morning, gentlemen.
Welcome to Creighton.

08:29.410 --> 08:33.240
My name is Mr. Wallace,
and I'm the warden of this prison.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.340
I wanted to personally greet you
by saying:

08:36.419 --> 08:38.549
I run a tight ship.

08:38.659 --> 08:41.530
My prison, my rules.

08:41.990 --> 08:46.250
Best advice I can give to you
is keep to yourself...

08:46.280 --> 08:49.180
...do your time
and don't break my rules.

08:49.250 --> 08:51.020
No matter how tough
you think you are- -

08:51.140 --> 08:53.970
And I know some of you think
you're real tough.

08:54.690 --> 08:56.750
- - I will break you.

08:57.090 --> 08:58.890
That's a promise.

08:59.010 --> 09:00.810
Understood?

09:00.930 --> 09:03.960
I got your back. I'm with you.

09:09.670 --> 09:10.830
Step forward.

09:14.790 --> 09:16.920
Listen up, punk.

09:17.030 --> 09:21.700
I know you like to cause problems.
That's why you got sent here.

09:21.700 --> 09:26.840
I'm gonna personally see to it
that that doesn't happen anymore.

09:26.830 --> 09:31.190
My officers will resort
to any and all measures necessary...

09:31.210 --> 09:33.040
...to keep you in line.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.930
Understand?

09:35.400 --> 09:37.160
Whatever you say, man. I'm not- -

09:37.290 --> 09:38.990
You'll keep your nose clean...

09:39.110 --> 09:42.380
...and stay out of other people's
affairs, won't you?

09:42.760 --> 09:46.060
Hey, man, look. You know,
I only concentrate on my own- -

09:48.360 --> 09:51.800
I'm not sure
I really heard you correctly.

09:51.850 --> 09:55.020
I just want to do my time and leave.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.380
That's what I thought you said.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.440
I'll remember you.

10:08.110 --> 10:12.140
Pick up your prison blues
and your shoes.

10:12.180 --> 10:14.270
Show them to their cellblocks.

10:14.670 --> 10:16.830
- Here you go.
- Next.

10:16.940 --> 10:19.710
- Here you go.
- Next.

10:20.050 --> 10:21.020
Here you go.

10:21.170 --> 10:23.830
Where you got your soap, kid?

10:23.920 --> 10:27.450
Shake my hand.
Come on. Shake my hand.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.380
This shit they call food- -

10:46.520 --> 10:47.950
Keep your eyes on the room.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.210
- Copy that.
- Anything could be a diversion.

10:54.960 --> 10:58.920
Only take one second for these
bastards to start killing each other.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.710
Sometimes I wonder why we bother
standing in the way.

11:12.410 --> 11:15.000
How long I gotta wait
in line to get food?

11:51.040 --> 11:52.260
What's up with that?

11:52.410 --> 11:55.680
Baboso wants more money
for bringing in the piece.

11:55.740 --> 11:58.070
Mira, you know
how much that mule was paid?

11:58.170 --> 12:00.110
Let me just cut him a piece.

12:05.730 --> 12:07.850
What if this motherfucker's
double- dealing...

12:07.970 --> 12:09.360
...with the Disciples, homes?

12:09.500 --> 12:12.130
- Let me do this.
- Are you sure?

12:31.910 --> 12:33.570
You shouldn't be sitting here,
brother.

12:34.530 --> 12:35.790
Is that right?

12:35.940 --> 12:38.740
Just trying to give you
some friendly advice.

12:38.820 --> 12:40.790
Come with me
or take your chances with them.

12:44.230 --> 12:47.090
- So I should come with you, huh?
- Yeah.

12:48.070 --> 12:51.300
- And not with them?
- Unless you got a loco death wish.

12:51.360 --> 12:55.560
And what if I just wanna
kick it here, keep to myself?

12:55.590 --> 12:58.220
Then I'd imagine
you'd get two shanks in you.

12:58.310 --> 12:59.740
One from each side.

13:07.590 --> 13:10.020
I don't see no shanks in him.

13:10.120 --> 13:13.280
Burke? Don't go near him.

13:13.990 --> 13:16.480
- Why?
- Because he don't want you to.

13:16.580 --> 13:17.640
How you know?

13:17.800 --> 13:20.930
Burke don't give a fuck about
anybody in here but himself.

13:21.540 --> 13:23.070
And that's cool for him.

13:23.210 --> 13:25.370
He can fight his own fights.

13:25.900 --> 13:27.490
But you....

13:28.230 --> 13:30.760
...you wouldn't last a heartbeat.

13:30.860 --> 13:33.720
Come on, I think you gonna
need some friends.

13:34.090 --> 13:36.250
Man, you see these?
I don't need shit.

13:36.460 --> 13:39.720
Put that little motherfucker away.
Let's go see Angel.

13:49.260 --> 13:52.060
Good to meet you.
Name's Angel.

13:52.140 --> 13:54.040
My name's Twitch. What's up?

13:54.280 --> 13:56.270
Right on. Shit.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.520
I'm from L.A. You know, it's a small
little city. You ever heard of it?

13:59.600 --> 14:00.930
I got people in L.A.

14:01.070 --> 14:02.800
I don't.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.910
You a long way from the ocean.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.030
This ain't Malibu.

14:07.150 --> 14:10.210
Every cell is the same to me, man.
Shit, you know- -

14:10.290 --> 14:13.120
Ain't the cells
you got to worry about.

14:13.490 --> 14:16.180
- You know who I am?
- Not really, am I su- -

14:16.270 --> 14:18.430
Wallace tell you nothing about me
when you got here?

14:18.540 --> 14:20.010
Wallace?

14:20.140 --> 14:21.200
That's the warden, right?

14:21.740 --> 14:23.540
Yeah, he like to think so...

14:23.660 --> 14:26.390
...running around here
giving orders with his hard ass.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.470
But in reality...

14:29.100 --> 14:30.970
...I'm the nigga in charge.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.990
I got what you call arrangements.

14:35.470 --> 14:37.200
So you have any problems...

14:37.550 --> 14:39.880
...or need any favors...

14:40.240 --> 14:41.670
...you come see me.

14:42.390 --> 14:43.940
And all I ask in return...

14:45.170 --> 14:48.500
-...is your loyalty.
- Sounds good to me, you know.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.760
- I only- - 
- You got to wear the mark.

14:50.870 --> 14:52.390
Mark?

14:57.110 --> 14:59.040
Angel of Death.

14:59.280 --> 15:00.910
That's what binds us.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.310
Damn. Y'all ain't got
no other type of membership?

15:03.410 --> 15:05.350
You know, like cards or some shit?

15:05.460 --> 15:07.190
Are you in, brother?

15:07.320 --> 15:11.310
Man, I only been here for a day.
Y'all don't even know me.

15:11.350 --> 15:13.010
How you know
I wanna roll with y'all?

15:13.140 --> 15:14.470
Is that a threat?

15:16.980 --> 15:19.680
- Look, man, I'm just saying, man- - 
- Either you with us...

15:19.770 --> 15:21.530
...or you with Cortez.

15:21.650 --> 15:24.450
- I ain't with nobody.
- Listen, brother.

15:24.530 --> 15:25.870
There's a war coming on.

15:26.010 --> 15:28.670
You wear this mark, I guarantee
you won't be a casualty.

15:31.350 --> 15:33.110
Come on.

15:35.260 --> 15:36.450
Move it.

15:36.600 --> 15:40.000
I say we get the brothers together,
man, and make this happen.

15:40.060 --> 15:42.080
- Get up in the line now.
- Get out of my way.

15:42.200 --> 15:45.430
It's just a matter of time before shit
hits the fan with Cortez and his gang.

15:45.500 --> 15:46.830
Be cool, baby, we'll get him.

15:46.970 --> 15:48.940
These motherfuckers.
What are we waiting on?

15:49.050 --> 15:51.520
- We will. We will.
- Come on, when?

15:51.610 --> 15:54.340
When the fuck I say so.

15:54.430 --> 15:58.230
You think you could run this shit
better than me, huh?

15:58.880 --> 16:00.600
Look. What I'm saying is...

16:00.730 --> 16:02.960
...Cortez is bringing in more guards
and more money...

16:03.070 --> 16:05.230
...while you sit around
waiting on God to give you...

16:05.340 --> 16:07.240
-...a motherfucking message.
- Let me ask you- -

16:07.360 --> 16:09.050
What the fuck was that?

16:10.300 --> 16:12.290
You were in my way.

16:13.720 --> 16:15.590
You know something, Burke?

16:15.710 --> 16:19.200
It's about time you fucking learn
how things operate around here.

16:19.260 --> 16:20.790
And you're gonna show me?

16:20.930 --> 16:24.920
Yeah. Go ahead.
I'll let you take the first swing.

16:25.370 --> 16:28.240
Fuck up some of that good behavior
you got going.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.250
- Another time, Angel.
- Don't you walk away from me, Burke.

16:31.330 --> 16:34.130
Don't you fucking walk away
from me, Burke!

16:34.210 --> 16:38.770
One day. You be ready, Burke.
One day.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.620
Dirt nap.

16:40.740 --> 16:42.600
Come on.

16:58.980 --> 17:00.910
We have a deal, right?

17:02.240 --> 17:03.800
Right?

17:05.319 --> 17:07.410
We got the deal.

17:10.819 --> 17:12.450
Okay.

17:59.150 --> 18:01.050
So you Burke, huh?

18:01.480 --> 18:03.250
Ain't that your name?

18:10.640 --> 18:14.130
You know, I heard that you don't
deal with none of the gangs and....

18:14.190 --> 18:15.880
You don't fool with none of that, huh?

18:16.010 --> 18:18.570
Angel's scared of you.

18:18.670 --> 18:22.200
Cortez is afraid of you.

18:22.250 --> 18:24.480
They afraid of me too, you know.

18:24.590 --> 18:27.110
You know, I don't play too much, man.

18:28.970 --> 18:30.670
You a loner, huh?

18:30.800 --> 18:32.530
I'm a loner too,
you know what I'm saying.

18:32.650 --> 18:35.590
Ain't too much I do, you know.
I don't really, you know, get involved- -

18:35.660 --> 18:38.430
Shut up and keep it that way.

18:41.460 --> 18:45.150
- I'm only trying to make it a little easier.
- Don't.

18:50.260 --> 18:53.090
So what you in for anyway, man?
What, you killed somebody?

18:53.170 --> 18:55.540
What, you robbed a bank
or something?

18:55.630 --> 18:58.190
I was thinking about doing
something like that myself, man.

18:58.290 --> 19:02.350
- You could tell me. I'm your boy, man.
- Shut up, will you?

19:02.390 --> 19:04.450
Damn.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.960
Whatever. Shit.

19:10.260 --> 19:13.920
You know, if you don't wanna talk
all you gotta do is just say it.

19:13.970 --> 19:17.460
I'm just trying to communicate
with you, you know.

19:18.360 --> 19:20.480
I don't wanna talk.

19:26.810 --> 19:27.790
That's cool.

19:31.220 --> 19:33.120
Here, sit at number three.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.710
You're not gonna see Dad?

19:34.840 --> 19:37.640
Honey, I have nothing to say
to your dad.

19:39.190 --> 19:40.750
Fine.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.210
It's your time.

19:49.910 --> 19:52.750
Gotta go see my woman, man.
Gonna go do it big.

19:52.830 --> 19:56.190
I'm gonna talk to you later, huh?
Good conversation.

20:00.310 --> 20:02.680
Don't you listen in on my conversation.

20:02.780 --> 20:04.440
Be cool.

20:05.440 --> 20:06.700
Rise, Rise, Rise.

20:06.840 --> 20:10.400
You just had to go and get
your little butt sent to Missouri.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.480
- That's a good thing, ain't it?
- A good thing?

20:12.600 --> 20:15.540
It's harder knowing that you're so close
and I still can't see you.

20:15.610 --> 20:17.010
I know, I know, babe, but look- -

20:17.150 --> 20:20.610
And then it's two more weeks
before I can see your sorry ass again.

20:20.670 --> 20:23.660
- I just can't do it, Bernard.
- What's with all this "Bernard" shit?

20:23.740 --> 20:25.640
I told you,
don't you call me Bernard here.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.190
My name's Twitch. Twitch.

20:28.290 --> 20:30.190
Don't you forget that, woman.

20:30.300 --> 20:33.960
Don't you "woman" me, Bernard.
I put up with enough from you, okay?

20:34.010 --> 20:36.980
I looked the other way
when you had that fat- ass girlfriend.

20:37.050 --> 20:38.580
What was you doing with her anyway?

20:38.720 --> 20:41.210
All she was gonna do was give you
some fat- ass children.

20:41.310 --> 20:44.040
That wasn't fat, that was muscle.

20:44.130 --> 20:47.820
Look, I know, baby, a lot of times
it seems like I take you for granted- -

20:47.870 --> 20:50.000
Oh, you take me for granted
all the time.

20:50.370 --> 20:53.340
I ain't that bad.
I got you the ring, didn't l?

20:53.410 --> 20:55.040
This shit probably ain't even real.

20:55.170 --> 20:57.330
I don't know when you plan
on having the wedding...

20:57.440 --> 20:59.170
...but I am calling it off.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.270
Yes, I'm calling it off, okay?

21:01.380 --> 21:02.870
Your momma gonna be so upset.

21:03.010 --> 21:05.640
Wait, wait, hold on, hold on, baby.
Hold on, now.

21:06.370 --> 21:07.800
I know I make a lot of promises.

21:07.940 --> 21:10.770
Yeah. You make a lot of promises,
like you gonna marry me...

21:10.850 --> 21:13.320
...Iike you love me,
like you gonna get parole.

21:13.410 --> 21:16.070
- But- - 
- You never deliver on the promises.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.390
Ever. How am I supposed to trust you?

21:18.500 --> 21:20.900
First of all, I am getting parole, Cherise.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.930
- When?
- Soon.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.490
Hello, Amy.

21:31.010 --> 21:32.780
Hey, Ellie.

21:33.060 --> 21:34.930
You look great.

21:35.270 --> 21:36.700
You changed your hair, didn't you?

21:36.840 --> 21:39.270
- I like it.
- Thanks.

21:39.370 --> 21:41.840
- How's school, baby?
- It's summer.

21:42.600 --> 21:45.160
Oh, sorry.

21:46.210 --> 21:50.050
- No, this is it, Bernard. I'm leaving.
- Wait, wait, hold on.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.770
All right, now.

21:52.900 --> 21:56.000
I gotta tell you something.
I am getting out, okay?

21:56.070 --> 21:58.040
- I just- - 
- Forget you, Bernard.

21:58.150 --> 22:01.520
Just listen to me, okay?
Damn.

22:01.580 --> 22:03.740
What I'm talking about
has to do with our future.

22:03.850 --> 22:07.080
Okay. All right. You know,
this better be real good.

22:07.150 --> 22:09.270
It is good. Now, I got a plan.

22:09.390 --> 22:12.450
- A plan?
- Yeah, a plan.

22:12.710 --> 22:13.870
It's gonna get us rich.

22:14.030 --> 22:16.520
What the hell are you thinking?
You gonna get rich in here?

22:16.620 --> 22:18.140
You sound like some kind of fool.

22:18.280 --> 22:21.740
Who are you talking to?
Now, just listen to me.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.400
Me getting transferred here
was a part of the plan.

22:24.490 --> 22:26.390
- What you mean?
- I mean...

22:26.510 --> 22:28.370
...I got transferred here
on purpose.

22:28.490 --> 22:30.360
Now I know you's a fool.

22:30.480 --> 22:34.210
Man, listen. I got about a month
to get up out this joint, okay?

22:34.250 --> 22:36.880
- You mean, escape?
- Just keep it down!

22:37.900 --> 22:40.270
I am not having no fugitive husband.

22:40.370 --> 22:43.160
And I for sure ain't having
no fugitive baby daddy.

22:44.140 --> 22:48.140
Now, what I'm about to do
is gonna set us up for life.

22:50.190 --> 22:53.790
- Really? Man, are you serious?
- Trust me.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.540
And then I'll get you
anything you want.

22:57.780 --> 23:00.610
All I want is for you to come home.

23:02.160 --> 23:06.100
Well, listen to me, baby. I could set up
a little "home sweet home" right here.

23:06.130 --> 23:10.590
Set up one of those little conjugal
visiting rooms, you know what I mean.

23:10.610 --> 23:15.510
- Slide you something special.
- Really? You could make that happen?

23:15.510 --> 23:18.870
You know I can. They don't call me
"The Alaskan Pipeline" for nothing.

23:18.930 --> 23:21.460
Oh, I mean, really, for real
we can really get a room, baby?

23:21.560 --> 23:23.550
Yeah. Twitch will take care of it.

23:23.670 --> 23:27.400
But I heard you have to arrange those
visits, like, weeks in advance, Bernard.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.470
And plus I think you gotta be married.

23:29.590 --> 23:33.550
Didn't I say Twitch will take care of it?

23:34.680 --> 23:37.150
- Really?
- Now give it to me, give it here.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.970
Oh, chubblies.

23:41.080 --> 23:44.340
- Don't look at me.
- Let's go, time's up.

23:44.410 --> 23:47.340
Shit. One month.

23:48.500 --> 23:50.900
Mind your business.

23:52.570 --> 23:53.930
I'm gonna be leaving.

23:55.510 --> 23:58.040
- What do you mean?
- Me and Mom are moving to Dallas.

23:58.140 --> 23:59.100
Dallas?

23:59.260 --> 24:02.190
So I don't know when I'll be able
to visit you again.

24:07.900 --> 24:09.830
This is your mother's idea, isn't it?

24:10.650 --> 24:12.520
Please don't be mad at her, okay?

24:13.980 --> 24:15.540
I'm gonna start college next year...

24:15.680 --> 24:18.640
...so I probably won't have the chance
to visit you.

24:22.010 --> 24:26.510
You know, I'd like to spend more time
with you, but you're stuck in here, Dad.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.620
And I know it wasn't your fault,
but it happened.

24:33.850 --> 24:35.750
Look at me, Ellie.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.750
Just tell me you know
how much I love you, baby.

24:56.060 --> 24:57.590
What you gonna do with that?

24:57.730 --> 24:59.660
Angel about to bless you.

24:59.780 --> 25:01.110
But I ain't sneezed.

25:01.570 --> 25:03.970
- Man up, little nigga.
- Oh, hell, no.

25:04.510 --> 25:06.380
Get off me, man.

25:07.360 --> 25:10.020
Wait, hold on. Wait. Wait.

25:12.930 --> 25:14.630
Fuck!

25:17.310 --> 25:18.680
Damn it.

25:18.820 --> 25:21.480
Get off me. God.

25:32.680 --> 25:34.200
Cherise is waiting for me.

25:34.340 --> 25:38.070
Honeymoon suite be ready
in about 1 0 minutes.

25:39.460 --> 25:43.690
My sugar pot's ready
for some honey loving.

25:43.720 --> 25:46.950
Me too, baby. He won't be able
to walk after I'm done with him.

25:47.010 --> 25:51.610
Nope. He won't be able to walk,
my baby.

26:00.740 --> 26:03.370
You wink at me, bitch?

26:05.580 --> 26:07.100
What's up, big papa?

26:14.920 --> 26:16.890
All right. Let's go.

26:18.510 --> 26:20.560
Come on, Burke.
You're on cafeteria duty.

26:23.150 --> 26:26.740
Open them up.
Is Cherise down there, man?

26:28.270 --> 26:30.600
- What's going on, Lewis?
- Detector's not functioning.

26:30.700 --> 26:32.460
Are you for real?

26:32.590 --> 26:36.020
Come on, man, I ain't got no metal on,
I ain't got no handcuffs.

26:36.080 --> 26:38.910
- Come on. Cherise is down there.
- You wanna be strip- searched instead?

26:38.990 --> 26:40.920
Yeah. I'm gonna get naked, all right...

26:41.040 --> 26:42.730
...in there, not out here.

27:11.150 --> 27:13.020
Yo, what you looking at?

27:18.900 --> 27:20.920
Angel!

27:30.710 --> 27:32.300
Burke!

27:46.580 --> 27:48.670
JT, snatch the gun, man.

27:48.790 --> 27:50.590
Damn, Angel.

27:54.360 --> 27:55.330
Don't touch him.

27:55.480 --> 27:57.880
- I was just closing his eyes.
- Don't fucking touch him.

27:57.970 --> 28:00.140
I want ten grand on Burke's head.
He's fucking dead.

28:11.770 --> 28:12.960
Back off! Back off.

28:14.710 --> 28:17.440
But it ain't working, man.

28:18.170 --> 28:19.800
Cherise! Let me go.

28:30.110 --> 28:32.170
You'll never have to bother
with that man again.

28:32.280 --> 28:34.150
Stop it, Mom. He's my dad.

28:34.270 --> 28:36.200
What kind of father
has he been to you?

28:43.740 --> 28:46.710
Wallace, there's a riot.
We need a lockdown.

28:46.810 --> 28:49.510
Cellblock C in the cafeteria.

28:49.820 --> 28:52.380
There's a riot in the cafeteria.
Put it in lockdown.

28:52.480 --> 28:55.310
- I'm on it.
- Right away, sir.

28:55.390 --> 28:56.750
Come on, we're leaving.

28:56.890 --> 29:00.690
All cells in lockdown.
I repeat. Prisoners, back to your cells.

29:00.730 --> 29:02.860
- Did you hear that?
- Put it back. Put it down.

29:02.970 --> 29:06.000
I didn't do nothing, man.
The lockdown is down there.

29:11.780 --> 29:13.680
- Could you open this?
- I can't open the gate.

29:13.790 --> 29:15.780
- The whole prison's on lockdown.
- Lockdown?

29:15.900 --> 29:17.740
You're not gonna be able to stay.
You gotta go.

29:17.860 --> 29:20.050
- Oh, my God.
- You gotta go now.

29:20.160 --> 29:22.190
Oh, my God. Ellie, run!

29:22.310 --> 29:24.900
Oh, God. Run, Ellie, run!

29:33.350 --> 29:35.280
Y'all not the police.
You're the no- lease.

29:35.400 --> 29:36.890
I'll kick your ass.
Take these off.

29:47.850 --> 29:49.040
- Down.
- Down.

29:57.640 --> 29:58.760
What's going on, man?

29:59.270 --> 30:00.600
Burke killed Angel.

30:00.740 --> 30:02.300
Fuck, are you for real?

30:03.780 --> 30:05.440
What you gonna do,
you gonna kill me?

30:05.570 --> 30:08.300
Give me one reason why I shouldn't.

30:24.230 --> 30:26.290
You get a free pass this time.

30:28.040 --> 30:30.640
But don't ever let me
see you again, huh?

30:34.120 --> 30:35.420
Fuck.

30:36.110 --> 30:39.170
- Did you see who it was?
- No, I didn't get a look.

30:49.770 --> 30:52.300
Manual override.

31:37.810 --> 31:40.070
Perimeter gates are all shut.

31:40.310 --> 31:41.330
C block's still open.

31:41.680 --> 31:44.410
How the hell- -? Can we override?

31:44.500 --> 31:47.730
I'm trying, but it's not working.

31:47.800 --> 31:49.630
Get a team down there.

31:49.750 --> 31:54.740
Response team to C- block right away.
I repeat, response team to C- block.

31:57.170 --> 31:59.230
Now D- block's open.

31:59.350 --> 32:00.980
Who's doing this?

32:01.110 --> 32:03.170
Should I send in ERT, sir?

32:03.290 --> 32:06.120
- Affirmative.
- Yes, sir.

32:42.590 --> 32:45.210
Easiest ten grand I ever made.

32:49.630 --> 32:52.190
There's a price on your head
and I'm collecting.

32:58.300 --> 33:00.930
Burke, you popped Angel,
this is what you get.

33:16.450 --> 33:18.310
Come here. Get back here.

33:18.430 --> 33:19.460
Get him back here now.

33:28.030 --> 33:29.730
Burke.

33:29.860 --> 33:31.090
Come here.

33:31.710 --> 33:32.870
You move and I'll snap you.

33:33.030 --> 33:36.220
I ain't going nowhere, but I don't think
that's gonna stop him from shooting.

33:36.290 --> 33:39.020
Yeah, like he's gonna shoot a brother.

33:39.110 --> 33:41.010
Back off or I'll break his neck.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.680
- Hey, do as he say- - 
- Shut up.

33:42.820 --> 33:46.410
- This motherfucker killed Angel.
- I'm gonna count to three.

33:46.470 --> 33:50.030
- One.
- Drop- -  Drop the heat, JT.

33:51.240 --> 33:54.600
- JT, he's one of us, man.
- No, he isn't.

33:56.070 --> 33:57.800
Three.

34:01.380 --> 34:03.110
There's nowhere to hide.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.570
I own this motherfucker.

34:08.550 --> 34:10.739
Gotta hold on. Move.

34:10.850 --> 34:13.010
I'm talking to you. I'm talking to you.

34:13.130 --> 34:16.760
Stop where you are!
Stop where you are!

34:23.239 --> 34:25.760
Well, it's about time, Bernard.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.909
You in the wrong room.
You probably down the hall.

34:29.670 --> 34:31.199
Girl, what's wrong with you?
You okay?

34:31.340 --> 34:32.770
You don't know what's going on?

34:33.190 --> 34:36.489
This whole place is in lockdown.
There's a riot going on.

34:36.550 --> 34:38.040
- Oh, my God. Are you serious?
- Yes.

34:38.190 --> 34:40.520
Okay. We can't stay in here.

34:40.620 --> 34:42.920
The door doesn't lock.

34:53.230 --> 34:55.060
Halt, you men,
I will shoot if you don't!

34:56.110 --> 34:57.200
I will shoot you.

34:57.900 --> 35:02.000
- You ain't gonna kill me, is you, man?
- If you don't shut the fuck up, I will.

35:02.030 --> 35:04.500
You don't look like a killer.
But you'd best snap my neck.

35:04.590 --> 35:08.390
And you don't want 1 0 added to the 1 0
you already getting for killing Angel.

35:08.430 --> 35:11.870
I didn't kill Angel. Get out of here.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.510
Go on!

35:29.550 --> 35:30.750
- Coming this way.
- Crazy.

35:30.900 --> 35:32.120
- Shit.
- Coming this way.

35:32.270 --> 35:34.710
- Told y'all.
- Move back, back!

35:43.380 --> 35:45.000
Shit.

35:49.840 --> 35:52.070
- Move. Move. Go.
- Stay where you are!

35:52.180 --> 35:53.580
Oh, shit.

35:54.960 --> 35:57.020
Guards are coming!

36:05.010 --> 36:07.640
Hey, get him.
He's one of Angel's gang.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.100
Rivera.

36:11.250 --> 36:14.620
Oh, come on, man.
I ain't got no problem with y'all.

36:16.530 --> 36:19.090
- You're one of Angel's disciples, huh?
- Who?

36:19.450 --> 36:22.040
I don't even know the guy.
What's his name again?

36:22.140 --> 36:25.370
Oh, come on, man. Swear to God.

36:25.660 --> 36:29.220
Look, man, I'm just trying
to ease on through- -  What- -?

36:30.710 --> 36:34.440
That's pretty, man. Well,
I guess God don't believe you today.

36:34.490 --> 36:36.150
Back off.

36:37.210 --> 36:38.370
Get off.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.440
Hey, what's up, big papa?

36:48.090 --> 36:51.080
You need to stay out of this,
because it's got nothing to do with you.

36:51.160 --> 36:54.220
Oh, it doesn't? Where's Cortez?

36:54.300 --> 36:56.530
Cortez got less to do with your ass.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.200
- Is he trying to escape?
- Escape?

37:00.440 --> 37:04.070
- Twitch, get the fuck out of here.
- Man, what you want with me for?

37:04.380 --> 37:07.370
Wanna stay here and play around
with these guys? Now, go.

37:07.450 --> 37:10.320
Lucky he came. I'll kick your ass.

37:12.830 --> 37:14.690
Don't fuck with me.

37:15.040 --> 37:17.870
That was a good job, you know.
Clipping Angel's wings.

37:17.950 --> 37:19.610
Saved me the fucking trouble.

37:22.650 --> 37:26.150
Hey, aren't you gonna go, no?

37:26.210 --> 37:27.870
I set him up, bro.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.490
I'm gonna let the guards do it for us.

37:37.500 --> 37:39.670
Go over there and spread out.

37:43.940 --> 37:44.960
Let's go, let's go!

37:46.720 --> 37:48.550
Check that gate.

37:50.750 --> 37:52.650
They're all locked.

37:56.640 --> 37:59.130
What do we have here?

37:59.560 --> 38:02.650
- Please. Please.
- So beautiful.

38:03.620 --> 38:04.920
You're so tender.

38:05.060 --> 38:06.860
Hey, big dog,
Rivera sent me to find you.

38:06.980 --> 38:08.950
Where'd you get
these fine little honeys at?

38:09.060 --> 38:11.330
- Back off, homes.
- Hey, there's two of them.

38:11.430 --> 38:12.920
You got that one, I got this one- -

38:13.860 --> 38:17.160
I told you to back off, mano.

38:18.890 --> 38:21.320
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

38:21.410 --> 38:23.080
Bitch.

38:24.100 --> 38:27.700
All right, ese.
We'll see what's up later, right?

38:27.750 --> 38:29.280
See you.

38:31.460 --> 38:33.990
I have plans for both of you.

38:34.090 --> 38:35.750
Move!

38:48.070 --> 38:50.300
I could have handled that
all by myself back there.

38:50.410 --> 38:51.380
Yeah, right.

38:51.530 --> 38:55.190
As long as JT and everybody else
thinks I killed Angel, I'm a marked man.

38:55.240 --> 38:57.800
This way, they gotta shoot
their own brother to get to me.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.370
Man, these guys ain't my brothers.

38:59.500 --> 39:02.260
I told you before, Burke, I'm a loner.

39:02.860 --> 39:04.350
I don't care about no one.

39:04.650 --> 39:06.780
Just like you, man.

39:07.950 --> 39:10.820
- Come on.
- I got somebody I care about.

39:11.210 --> 39:13.580
You ladies picked
the wrong day to visit.

39:14.320 --> 39:18.120
You leave this room and you're dead.

39:24.690 --> 39:27.590
Oh, God, he locked us in.

39:27.660 --> 39:31.000
We're gonna have to stay calm.
We're gonna have to try and stay calm.

39:57.810 --> 39:59.240
Goddamn it.

39:59.990 --> 40:00.980
We lost power, warden.

40:01.140 --> 40:03.540
But we're switching
to emergency generators right now.

40:04.370 --> 40:06.310
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

40:06.420 --> 40:08.890
Trying to figure a way out of here.

40:09.300 --> 40:12.790
I saw on TV that the safest thing to do
at a time like this is to sit and wait.

40:12.850 --> 40:15.410
Are you crazy?
That is not the safest thing.

40:15.510 --> 40:18.270
Any minute that guy could be back
and shoot either one of us.

40:18.360 --> 40:20.380
If we do get out,
it might get us both killed.

40:20.500 --> 40:24.060
Well, you know what? You take your
chances here, I'll take mine out there.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.480
Let's say you do get out.
What- -  What- -  What then?

40:26.580 --> 40:28.050
There's a riot on the other side.

40:28.180 --> 40:31.450
Do you really think
you're gonna get out through that?

40:32.250 --> 40:33.910
- You have no idea- - 
- Shut up.

40:34.040 --> 40:35.700
What?

40:37.780 --> 40:38.750
Real smart.

40:38.900 --> 40:40.890
I don't think just because
you're big and tall...

40:41.020 --> 40:43.180
...that you can open that
without a key.

40:44.280 --> 40:48.240
You are just begging for me
to kick your ass, aren't you?

40:48.280 --> 40:50.370
Worse than the police, man.

40:50.490 --> 40:52.550
Get off me, man.
You make me nervous.

40:52.670 --> 40:55.600
- You got a bull's- eye on your back.
- I didn't kill Angel.

40:55.670 --> 40:58.070
- Well, who did, then?
- Cortez.

41:02.080 --> 41:04.240
Angel!

41:10.720 --> 41:12.620
- Cortez?
- Yeah.

41:12.730 --> 41:14.700
Oh, I get it.

41:14.810 --> 41:17.040
The riots, the distraction.

41:17.150 --> 41:20.580
Then you'll hook up with him later,
and y'all gonna fly off in the sunset.

41:20.640 --> 41:23.300
But not without me. I got value.
You take me with you.

41:23.390 --> 41:26.290
- You'll just slow me down.
- Slow you down?

41:26.370 --> 41:28.460
You the big meathead, motherfucker.

41:28.570 --> 41:30.440
- Burke!
- You- -

41:31.200 --> 41:33.330
- Get in the cell- - 
- Relax. I don't wanna hurt you.

41:33.440 --> 41:35.370
- Get in the cell- - 
- Relax.

41:37.860 --> 41:38.820
Oh, fuck.

41:43.140 --> 41:44.530
Come on.

41:44.670 --> 41:46.440
Get them all locked in there.

41:50.080 --> 41:51.410
Burke, Burke, Burke.

41:55.070 --> 41:57.470
- There's other juras I can hurt.
- That's right.

41:57.760 --> 41:58.920
Let's go!

41:59.070 --> 42:01.410
- Come on!
- Okay, okay, come on.

42:03.810 --> 42:05.040
Bitch.

42:05.890 --> 42:07.550
Beat your ass.

42:07.970 --> 42:11.410
You know, my fiance Bernard
could get this thing open in a second.

42:11.460 --> 42:13.020
He was a master thief.

42:13.160 --> 42:16.060
Real stupid, too.
Got himself caught up.

42:16.130 --> 42:19.070
I've been waiting for that man for years.

42:19.940 --> 42:22.810
What about you?
Who were you here to see?

42:23.780 --> 42:24.940
My dad.

42:26.280 --> 42:27.710
How long has he been in?

42:28.840 --> 42:30.400
Two years and four more to go.

42:34.500 --> 42:36.160
Let me try.

42:40.940 --> 42:44.500
Oh, goodness, I hope Bernard didn't go
get himself in no more trouble.

42:50.910 --> 42:53.340
- Would you look at that?
- They're dead.

42:54.650 --> 42:55.810
- All units- -!
- Hey, come on.

42:55.970 --> 42:57.370
- - cell block C.

42:57.500 --> 43:00.300
Get the walkie, man. It might- - 
Goddamn it!

43:00.890 --> 43:03.060
- Two guards are dead.
- Jesus.

43:03.170 --> 43:05.070
Surveillance confirms
both were last seen...

43:05.180 --> 43:07.850
...with the transfer from New Alcatraz
when the riot started.

43:10.720 --> 43:13.420
All officers fall back
behind the perimeter.

43:13.510 --> 43:17.270
Fall back behind the perimeter.
Meet at security checkpoints.

43:17.310 --> 43:18.680
You're clearing all cellblocks?

43:18.820 --> 43:21.510
I'm pulling my men out
until they've all got body armor...

43:21.600 --> 43:23.260
...and something to fight back with.

43:23.390 --> 43:25.230
All officers, pull back.

43:25.350 --> 43:30.040
Convene in the armory for body armor
and riot gear for ERT response.

43:32.160 --> 43:33.600
Yes?

43:35.680 --> 43:37.680
- Sir.
- What?

43:37.800 --> 43:40.420
There's an inmate on line 1 01.

43:40.520 --> 43:43.640
- What?
- It's Alex Cortez.

43:46.440 --> 43:47.600
Put him through.

43:51.400 --> 43:54.930
Alex? Where are you?
What phone are you on?

43:54.980 --> 43:58.650
You don't get to ask questions.
You get to take orders.

43:58.690 --> 44:01.030
Or else more body bags
are coming out the front gate.

44:01.130 --> 44:03.690
If I find out you're responsible
for anyone's death- -

44:03.780 --> 44:04.880
Shut up, fool.

44:05.480 --> 44:07.450
I'm doing life without parole.

44:07.560 --> 44:08.820
Don't threaten me again.

44:09.670 --> 44:13.040
- What phone is he on?
- It's impossible to tell.

44:13.100 --> 44:16.360
Here's what you're gonna do.
Call the governor.

44:16.420 --> 44:17.950
Tell him to get in his helicopter...

44:18.090 --> 44:20.350
...and fly his fat ass
out here immediately.

44:20.780 --> 44:23.540
I don't think I have the authority
to make that happen.

44:23.630 --> 44:25.960
If you can't, the hostages die.

44:26.350 --> 44:28.250
You have hostages?

44:28.360 --> 44:32.730
Yeah. Two beautiful young ladies.

44:32.910 --> 44:35.970
Not the kind of people you people
don't give a damn about.

44:36.040 --> 44:39.880
Make it happen, Wallace.
Don't forget the helicopter.

44:44.300 --> 44:47.670
Check the visitor records.
Find out if anyone is unaccounted for.

44:49.550 --> 44:51.740
- Get me the governor.
- Yes, sir, right away.

44:53.900 --> 44:56.890
Call the warden.
Get us the fuck out of here.

44:57.900 --> 44:59.630
We're in lockdown, governor.

44:59.760 --> 45:02.120
The two cellblocks
have been manually overridden.

45:02.220 --> 45:04.990
- How is that possible?
- We're not exactly sure, sir.

45:05.230 --> 45:08.720
It seems some inmates have gained
access to one of the control panels.

45:08.780 --> 45:09.770
What's their motive?

45:10.350 --> 45:14.010
It's gang- related. They're at war, sir.
Total chaos.

45:14.060 --> 45:15.190
Can you contain it?

45:15.540 --> 45:19.560
We're trying, sir. Emergency Response
Teams have been deployed.

45:19.600 --> 45:21.900
But there have been
some officer fatalities.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.400
Damn it, Wallace. I mean, it's the last
thing we need in an election year.

45:25.810 --> 45:29.340
- How many officers?
- Three that we know of for sure.

45:29.390 --> 45:33.590
All right. Look, you need to end this
thing quickly, no matter what it takes.

45:33.620 --> 45:36.550
All right?
But protect our people at all cost.

45:36.630 --> 45:37.850
Has the press been notified?

45:38.000 --> 45:40.340
No, sir. We've been able
to keep a lid on that.

45:40.630 --> 45:45.120
All right. My office will handle
all the press from this end.

45:45.140 --> 45:47.610
Just a minute. Charlie.
Hey, call the airport...

45:47.700 --> 45:50.670
...make sure the helicopter's ready,
wheels up in 20 minutes.

45:50.740 --> 45:52.640
We're going to Creighton.

45:52.760 --> 45:53.720
I'm on my way.

45:53.880 --> 45:55.470
Yes, sir.

46:02.290 --> 46:05.020
- Here we go.
- Tell me why you got transferred here.

46:05.460 --> 46:07.520
- Tell me.
- What, you don't know?

46:07.640 --> 46:10.300
- Bullshit about a fight.
- It was more than a fight.

46:10.390 --> 46:12.830
It's three of them and they thought
because I'm little...

46:12.950 --> 46:16.010
...I couldn't whoop that ass,
but I got this thing I did:

46:17.910 --> 46:19.970
- You can't fight worth a shit.
- Shut up.

46:20.090 --> 46:21.720
Kick your ass.

46:21.850 --> 46:24.320
- What?
- If my ankle didn't hurt.

46:24.860 --> 46:28.690
Hey, quit lying to me.
Why'd you get transferred here?

46:28.730 --> 46:33.290
I- -  I wanted to be closer
to my fiancee, Cherise.

46:33.310 --> 46:35.600
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

46:35.710 --> 46:36.760
Your eyes are moving...

46:36.920 --> 46:38.910
-...and you're lying.
- My eyes always move.

46:39.030 --> 46:42.700
Yeah, that's my point exactly.
Why'd you get transferred here?

46:42.750 --> 46:44.440
Look, I can't swim.

46:44.860 --> 46:47.890
Creighton has no water or sharks.

46:47.960 --> 46:52.700
You're telling me you got transferred
here just so you could escape?

46:52.700 --> 46:56.500
Goddamn right.
I'm a crazy motherfucker.

46:58.970 --> 47:00.000
No shit.

47:02.400 --> 47:04.990
There's the motherfucker
that killed Angel.

47:06.170 --> 47:08.140
Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait!

47:19.940 --> 47:21.630
- Come on.
- Bitch!

47:23.070 --> 47:24.800
Any luck?

47:24.930 --> 47:26.730
It's not working.

47:27.040 --> 47:29.270
Just keep trying.

47:29.790 --> 47:31.420
Been trying.

47:32.550 --> 47:34.170
Look, we need another way.

47:34.310 --> 47:37.000
God knows when that guy
is gonna come back.

47:41.320 --> 47:43.180
This is creepy.

47:44.070 --> 47:45.900
It's where people watch
the executions.

47:46.020 --> 47:47.490
Yeah.

47:47.620 --> 47:50.350
- I could never do it.
- Do what?

47:50.630 --> 47:53.290
Just sit there and watch people die.

47:56.740 --> 47:59.210
We gotta get this door open.
It's our only way out.

48:14.890 --> 48:16.910
You tried to get out?

48:17.420 --> 48:20.320
After what we just said to you?

48:26.250 --> 48:27.980
Tie her up.

48:29.320 --> 48:31.190
What the hell is wrong with you?

48:32.940 --> 48:37.070
I said, tie her up.

48:53.680 --> 48:56.080
It's too much like Alcatraz.

48:56.620 --> 48:59.180
Eric, make sure each officer gets one.

48:59.280 --> 49:02.540
Robert, back to the office
and monitor everything from there.

49:02.600 --> 49:05.770
All right, everybody. Time to move.

49:07.820 --> 49:10.950
All officers,
this is the warden speaking.

49:11.020 --> 49:14.360
Take back control
one cellblock at a time.

49:14.410 --> 49:16.850
There's some inmates
to be on the lookout for.

49:16.940 --> 49:20.740
One William Burke.
One Bernard "Twitch" Washington.

49:20.780 --> 49:22.940
Both suspects
in the murder of two guards.

49:23.060 --> 49:24.280
Did he just say my name?

49:25.070 --> 49:27.270
Twitch is the transfer
from New Alcatraz.

49:27.380 --> 49:29.500
Both he and Burke
are likely armed.

49:29.620 --> 49:31.450
No, no, we ain't, man.
Tell him we're not.

49:31.570 --> 49:33.470
Try to take them alive.

49:33.590 --> 49:35.520
- Shoot to kill if you have to.
- Give me that.

49:35.630 --> 49:39.160
- Man, you ain't talking to him.
- Look, I've gotta clear my name, Burke.

49:39.920 --> 49:42.360
We've got another situation
we gotta handle.

49:42.450 --> 49:46.320
Another inmate, Alex Cortez,
has taken hostages inside.

49:46.350 --> 49:47.750
We don't know exactly
how many...

49:47.890 --> 49:51.190
...but we believe
there are two missing visitors.

49:51.250 --> 49:53.840
- One Cherise- - 
- Hey, man, give me this thing.

49:53.940 --> 49:55.100
Wallace.

49:55.250 --> 49:56.840
- You there?
- Who's this?

49:56.980 --> 49:58.380
This is Twitch, man.

49:58.520 --> 50:00.510
Just what the hell
do you think you're doing?

50:00.630 --> 50:04.930
Hey, man, why you got this APB
out on me, man? I ain't kill nobody.

50:04.950 --> 50:06.610
No one's accused you of anything.

50:07.030 --> 50:09.500
Yeah, you did. You got the APB
cracking on us, man.

50:09.910 --> 50:12.380
Rioters everywhere, man.
That's not due process.

50:12.470 --> 50:15.910
Okay, then turn yourself in
and let's clear this up.

50:17.560 --> 50:19.580
- What? What is it?
- We're not meeting him.

50:19.700 --> 50:22.800
- Twitch, are you there?
- Yeah, man.

50:22.870 --> 50:25.400
Well, what do you say?
About going over this face to face?

50:26.840 --> 50:28.030
I know how that one works.

50:28.180 --> 50:30.240
We get there
and all your guard dogs are there.

50:30.360 --> 50:32.160
You can forget that one, buddy.

50:32.280 --> 50:34.340
My men won't harm you, I promise.

50:35.260 --> 50:37.660
Man, you gonna call the APB off
or what, Wallace?

50:37.750 --> 50:40.120
Just tell me where you are
and we'll work this- -

50:40.220 --> 50:41.810
You're not gonna meet with him.

50:41.980 --> 50:44.570
Man, this is bullshit.
This prison's full of shit.

50:46.040 --> 50:47.010
Twitch?

50:51.640 --> 50:55.240
Twitch. Goddamn it, let's go.

50:55.290 --> 50:57.050
Open it.

51:03.550 --> 51:08.920
The second hostage is Ellie Burke,
daughter of inmate William Burke.

51:15.740 --> 51:19.300
Keep your eyes right. Move it out.
Keep your eyes right. Move it.

51:29.920 --> 51:32.080
Hey, perro. Look at this.
Handle it.

51:32.190 --> 51:34.090
Hurry up, men. Hurry up.

51:38.720 --> 51:40.210
Where's Burke?

51:40.350 --> 51:41.820
I don't know.

51:42.690 --> 51:45.820
- Are you sure?
- I don't give a damn about Burke.

51:45.890 --> 51:48.920
- You, motherfu- - 
- Wow, easy, easy. Easy.

51:51.330 --> 51:52.660
Is that right?

51:52.800 --> 51:53.900
Where's your jefe?

51:54.150 --> 51:55.810
I don't give a damn about him, either.

51:55.940 --> 51:58.600
You see, because he fucked me over
with his escape plan, man.

51:59.360 --> 52:01.990
- Escape plan?
- That's right. He took hostages.

52:02.080 --> 52:04.880
And, you know,
one of them is Burke's daughter.

52:04.960 --> 52:08.830
That's right. Yeah. And he's going
to use them to get out of here.

52:08.870 --> 52:11.000
Bet you didn't know that, huh?

52:12.520 --> 52:14.610
Hey, perro, that's the police
with riot gear.

52:14.730 --> 52:16.250
- Stop!
- This don't look good, man.

52:16.390 --> 52:18.620
Show these motherfuckers
who run this place!

53:25.770 --> 53:27.400
Tear gas.

53:29.900 --> 53:31.270
Get out of here.

53:53.780 --> 53:55.940
Keep going, man. What?

54:01.650 --> 54:04.240
- Let's move it, dog. Let's move.
- Fuck you.

54:11.540 --> 54:13.200
I don't like the way this shit sounds.

54:13.330 --> 54:16.030
It don't sound like they're handling
this too good, man.

54:16.120 --> 54:18.020
Cortez ain't gonna surrender, man.

54:18.130 --> 54:20.930
- We gotta get to him first.
- Look, I've been here before.

54:21.010 --> 54:22.240
Nobody wins.

54:22.900 --> 54:24.530
What are you talking about?

54:24.660 --> 54:25.720
The Rock.

54:26.140 --> 54:29.630
New Alcatraz.
Man, I did five years, man.

54:29.690 --> 54:32.660
One night, man,
it was just raining like fuck, man.

54:32.730 --> 54:35.090
Fucking helicopter crashed
into the roof, man.

54:38.710 --> 54:40.270
No!

54:58.070 --> 55:01.200
People started coming out, man,
shooting people with all kinds of guns.

55:16.730 --> 55:20.790
Inmates died, guards died, you know.
A lot of shit was going on, man.

55:20.830 --> 55:23.760
Come on, I lost a lot of people
in there, man.

55:23.840 --> 55:25.070
People that I cared about.

55:27.360 --> 55:28.620
No!

55:29.410 --> 55:31.030
No! No!

55:35.900 --> 55:37.430
God.

55:41.730 --> 55:44.820
Why the hell would guys
break into prison?

55:45.630 --> 55:47.930
Man, none of that matters to me.
Just listen to me.

55:48.030 --> 55:50.730
A lot of shit happened, okay?

55:50.820 --> 55:54.880
- I ain't trying to go through shit again.
- Look, man, this time's different.

55:54.910 --> 55:56.570
Follow me.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.900
How we gonna- -? Damn....

56:02.020 --> 56:05.040
Look, I could teach you some shit.
Man, I should just- -

56:05.120 --> 56:07.490
- Hey, no.
- Big bad Burke.

56:09.000 --> 56:13.090
Yeah, you couldn't do it like a man.
You had to do it like a little bitch.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.420
- It's not what you think.
- You know what I'm thinking?

56:15.520 --> 56:17.010
Yeah, I didn't kill Angel.

56:17.380 --> 56:19.180
Oh, so you still can't admit that shit?

56:19.300 --> 56:21.530
I'd respect you more
if you could admit that shit.

56:21.640 --> 56:23.370
So we gonna do this like men.

56:23.490 --> 56:25.020
Old- school style.

56:25.350 --> 56:26.540
Do what you gotta do.

56:55.210 --> 56:57.840
Now, see, that was just the appetizer.

56:57.930 --> 56:59.330
Now it's time for the main course.

56:59.470 --> 57:02.160
We're gonna cut your ass up,
make you into some Chinese food...

57:02.250 --> 57:04.310
...and serve you to the skinheads.

57:05.190 --> 57:07.960
Look at me. Yeah.

57:08.590 --> 57:10.580
Old- school style.

57:14.320 --> 57:16.180
Take this motherfucker
to the cafeteria.

57:16.300 --> 57:17.890
Yeah.

57:30.290 --> 57:32.690
Get that fryer going. Get it going.

57:34.190 --> 57:35.890
Yeah, yeah. This will do.

57:38.130 --> 57:41.030
This is what we're gonna do.
What it look like?

57:41.100 --> 57:43.590
Looks like you gonna
cook something.

57:44.110 --> 57:46.840
Cortez killed Angel, not me.

57:47.920 --> 57:49.890
- Oh, fuck, man.
- Let him go.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.400
- Easy, easy, cool. Let him go.
- I'll whoop your ass.

57:52.500 --> 57:53.460
Easy.

57:53.620 --> 57:55.680
Come on, JT, listen to me.
Listen to me.

57:56.530 --> 58:00.120
I ain't gonna say nothing to nobody,
you already know that.

58:00.180 --> 58:02.740
What about the rest
of these motherfuckers, shit?

58:02.830 --> 58:05.600
Is everybody else gonna be quiet
about the whole thing?

58:05.680 --> 58:08.080
- What the hell is you saying, Twitch?
- I'm just saying...

58:08.180 --> 58:10.170
...we gonna kill this motherfucker,
right?

58:10.290 --> 58:13.450
I mean, what, is everybody else
gonna be quiet about the whole thing?

58:13.940 --> 58:17.000
- Damn right.
- And take it to their grave?

58:19.250 --> 58:21.220
I mean, fuck it, cook him.

58:21.330 --> 58:23.930
If anybody gonna speak
a word about this, it's you.

58:24.150 --> 58:27.020
Snitch.
Now get the fuck out the way.

58:27.090 --> 58:29.530
Fellas, we gonna have
"sum dumb fuck" on the menu.

58:29.620 --> 58:32.520
- Shit. Quit pushing.
- It's too bad, Burke.

58:32.600 --> 58:35.230
You won't get a chance
to save your daughter.

58:35.320 --> 58:37.480
Oh, you didn't know, did you?

58:38.100 --> 58:41.770
This motherfucker didn't know
Cortez had his daughter as hostage.

58:41.810 --> 58:44.610
It's a first- class ticket
out of motherfucking paradise.

59:01.430 --> 59:04.330
Yeah, and after Cortez,
I got next, motherfucker.

59:17.050 --> 59:19.710
Come here, come on, Burke.
Burke, Burke, Burke, come on.

59:19.800 --> 59:22.530
We gotta go. We gotta go.

59:46.140 --> 59:48.630
- I don't like the sound of this.
- I'm going after Cortez.

59:48.740 --> 59:50.970
- You going after him?
- He's got my daughter.

59:51.070 --> 59:54.040
You wanna escape? Go ahead.

59:54.560 --> 59:56.290
You tripping.

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:03.950
Hey, Burke. Hold on, man.

01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:06.850
Wallace, is the governor on his way?

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.620
What do you want with him?

01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:21.390
This is the governor. I'm on my way.
ETA 30 minutes.

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.770
I want the whole prison locked down
by the time I get there.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.430
Now, we've got another situation
we've gotta handle.

01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:30.130
Two guards are confirmed dead.
We have suspects.

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.550
Our men are tracking them now.

01:00:32.650 --> 01:00:35.440
I want those guys caught.
Dead or alive.

01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:36.620
Doesn't matter to me.

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:39.850
Make sure you keep the situation
under control.

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:42.210
I'll be there as soon as I can.

01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:48.920
Wait, wait. Hold on, Burke.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.160
- Hold on. Damn.
- Shit.

01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:54.140
- Come on, give me a hand.
- Wait, wait, wait. Let me try this.

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:55.650
Pull.

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.780
- Just....
- Over here, hermano.

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:00.260
Come on.

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.490
- Come on.
- I can't.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.630
- Wait. I got an idea, I got an idea.
- What?

01:01:06.310 --> 01:01:07.970
Well, you know...

01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:10.800
...I used to steal cars.
I could hot- wire this bitch.

01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:12.220
Man, hurry up, will you?

01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:16.450
So tell me your charge.

01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:19.790
- I'll tell you mine.
- I don't really care.

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:22.150
Breaking and entering, huh?

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.120
- What, you hit the White House?
- Man, hurry up!

01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:27.590
I'm not doing shit.

01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:32.730
What you in here for?

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.460
- I'm in here for nothing.
- Man, that's what they all say, man.

01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:42.100
Okay, a friend of mine knocked off
an armored car.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.150
I should have known about it,
but I didn't.

01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:46.530
Cops found him at my house
with a bag full of cash.

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:48.760
- Bag full of cash?
- Yeah.

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:53.040
He implicated me, knocked
a couple of years off his sentence.

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:56.240
I got five years.

01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:58.380
I lost my wife.

01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:01.410
She took my little girl away from me.

01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:03.250
She's the only thing I ever loved.

01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:06.330
Everybody else....

01:02:06.450 --> 01:02:09.080
Everybody else has shit on me.

01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:11.920
I got burnt before too, Burke.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.990
I'd never burn you, homey.

01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:17.600
Yeah, we'll see.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:22.230
- Get that motherfucker. Come on.
- Oh, shit.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.090
Come on, Burke.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:43.140
Fuck you, Burke. You're a dead man.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.030
- Yo, dog, this way.
- All right, all right.

01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:49.900
Ready?

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:53.710
- Let's go, let's go.
- Let's go. Move it out.

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:57.410
Total lockdown.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.310
Let's put this all back together, now.

01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:08.530
Get ready for anything.

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:12.980
Half the cellblocks are under control.
It's a matter of time for the rest.

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:16.850
Still no Cortez. This is a prison.
How many places can he hide?

01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:18.520
How does he think he's gonna get out?

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.740
- Glad you could make it, sir.
- What's the status?

01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:43.250
Afraid things have gotten worse.

01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:47.050
Inmate Alex Cortez has captured
two civilian hostages.

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:49.000
- Both females.
- Christ.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.920
Wallace, how could this happen?

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:53.530
Governor, the riot began
just after visitation...

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:56.330
...and one of the hostages
was in the conjugal room.

01:03:56.410 --> 01:03:59.910
All right, let's get in there.
I wanna talk to this Cortez.

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.210
Burke locked us up.
He's a dead man.

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:14.500
Hey, you do this thing,
you're gonna get out of here. Soon.

01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:16.050
Got it?

01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:22.060
This place is falling apart, man.

01:04:22.310 --> 01:04:25.760
- Oh, shit.
- Burke, I've been looking for you.

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:27.540
Check it out, man.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:28.650
Where's Cortez?

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:31.740
You just follow me. I know
where that motherfucker Cortez is, bro.

01:04:31.810 --> 01:04:33.300
- Come on.
- I don't like this.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.280
This runs below the cellblock.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.890
- It ends at the machine shop.
- That's where Cortez is?

01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:41.220
That's right, the motherfucker.
He knew about this shit all along.

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.180
Just around here.

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.270
Shit.

01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:49.800
- Where are you leading us, man?
- I told you, Cortez. Relax, man.

01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:52.410
Why are you telling us this?

01:04:52.550 --> 01:04:56.010
I was supposed to break out with this
motherfucking bitch. He betrayed me.

01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:58.440
And I want some
motherfucking payback.

01:04:58.530 --> 01:04:59.830
I could use your help.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.330
Listen, I don't give a shit
about payback.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.530
I just wanna find my daughter.

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:09.570
Man, I don't like this.

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.140
I don't like this. How come
nobody else know about this?

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:14.560
A cop will sell any information
for a price.

01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:16.480
Hey!

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.960
Rivera! Fuck.

01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:24.970
What the fuck? I knew we
couldn't trust this fucking guy.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:31.640
You know what? You tell the warden
when this is all over, he'll pay.

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:35.290
When I get my hands on Cortez,
I'm gonna snap his fucking neck.

01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:39.960
Gotta be another way.

01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:07.190
Oh, shit.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.500
I didn't do nothing.

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.330
- Let's go, come on.
- Twitch.

01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:17.240
Better come.

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.540
Look, I want some answers
and I want them now.

01:07:46.650 --> 01:07:48.280
And this time, I want the truth.

01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:51.400
- About what?
- Why your ass got transferred here.

01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:53.610
I already told you why.

01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:56.180
All right, fuck it, man.

01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:01.900
I ain't gonna find it anyway.

01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:04.450
- Find what?
- The gold.

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:06.030
Let me get this straight.

01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:09.740
You got transferred here so you could
break out and find some gold?

01:08:09.790 --> 01:08:14.190
- $1 60 million worth.
- Bullshit.

01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:16.609
All right. I know you never heard
of Lester McKenna.

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:19.540
United States Supreme Court
Justice Jane McPherson...

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:21.410
...just landed at New Alcatraz.

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:24.600
She's here to witness
the execution of Lester McKenna.

01:08:24.670 --> 01:08:27.700
He was my cellie at the Rock, okay?

01:08:27.779 --> 01:08:30.710
He done hit the government
for a shitload of cash, you understand?

01:08:30.790 --> 01:08:31.950
Gold bricks.

01:08:32.350 --> 01:08:34.450
McPherson is the judge
who sentenced McKenna...

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:39.020
...in the now infamous heist of almost
$200 million in U.S. gold brick.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.880
They found one piece of it,
but he stashed another piece, okay?

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.220
And only two people know about it,
me and Hubert...

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:45.880
...who's also on the Rock.

01:08:46.529 --> 01:08:49.130
I'm out in a month. Mark your calendar.

01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:51.240
Feds have been coming around
all week...

01:08:51.370 --> 01:08:54.490
...promising me serenity
if I tell them where I hid it.

01:08:54.569 --> 01:08:57.260
In a bizarre twist,
McKenna was able to stash the gold...

01:08:57.350 --> 01:08:58.540
...before he was apprehended.

01:08:58.689 --> 01:09:01.390
And he vowed never to divulge
its whereabouts.

01:09:01.479 --> 01:09:04.609
This is what led to the nationwide
treasure hunt by the FBI...

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:06.840
...that's gone on for 17 years.

01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:11.279
Now it's looking like McKenna
just might take his secret to the grave.

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:14.270
Reporting live from Pier 39
on Fisherman's Wharf...

01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:17.240
...I'm Roxanne Long
from San Francisco.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:20.189
That crazy motherfucker made sure
nobody else could find it.

01:09:29.130 --> 01:09:31.220
- Where is it?
- I ain't gonna tell you.

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:32.970
I didn't say I wanted your gold.

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:35.220
Oh, fuck off, Burke.
You're not so noble to where...

01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:36.630
...you don't wanna get no money.

01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:40.930
Shit, I been without it so long
that if I had it, I'd appreciate it.

01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:43.300
Look, neither one of us
are on death row.

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:46.170
So we'll get our asses out of here
and we'll find it.

01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:50.939
Wait, wait, wait.
I got an idea, man.

01:09:52.170 --> 01:09:54.069
You know what?
I think I know where Cortez is.

01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:58.700
Cortez is on line one.

01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:01.600
Hey, Wallace. Is the governor there?

01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:04.340
- I'm here.
- Glad you could make it.

01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:07.800
- Let me speak to the hostages.
- I don't think so.

01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:09.820
How do I know
you haven't harmed any of them?

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:13.170
Trust me, governor.
Did you bring the helicopter?

01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:16.760
Yeah. Listen, about that.
We're trying to bring one in now.

01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:20.010
Bullshit.
I'm taking the one you brought.

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.340
Have it in the rec yard in 1 0 minutes.

01:10:22.450 --> 01:10:24.610
And no games.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.620
By now I think you know
what I'm capable of.

01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:30.480
What's the ETA
on the hostage negotiator?

01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:33.170
Forget that.
Cortez is done negotiating.

01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:35.420
Give him the helicopter. For now.

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:37.940
Wait a minute. That's a murderer
you're setting loose.

01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:40.200
If you got a better idea,
I'd certainly like to hear it.

01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:43.000
Let's at least keep the lines
of communication with him open.

01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:46.790
Time is running out and I want
those hostages out of there.

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.130
We don't even know
where Cortez is holding them.

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:52.100
Try looking at your monitors.
Who are those guys?

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:59.570
That's inmate Burke
and that New Alcatraz transfer.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:02.200
The girl is Burke's daughter.

01:11:02.710 --> 01:11:05.700
And the woman
is the other inmate's fiance.

01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:10.740
- Looks like they're trying to find them.
- Those two?

01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:14.270
- They're heading towards the annex.
- Annex?

01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:17.020
I need ten officers
to come with me right away.

01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:19.640
And bring armor.

01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:21.100
What's the annex?

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.750
Death row.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.120
- Sometimes you gotta use your brain.
- Okay.

01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:41.910
Yes, we are in the game. Move.

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.910
Okay. Let's do this.

01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:02.400
- Bernard.
- Dad.

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.720
- Ellie.
- Keep cool.

01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:06.600
What the fuck is going on?

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:10.200
That's your daughter?

01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:15.000
And this is your bitch?

01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:17.330
Oh, come on, Cortez.
Man, don't do that.

01:12:17.530 --> 01:12:20.700
- Let them go, Cortez.
- Who the fuck do you think you are?

01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:24.150
Get out of the doorway.
These two are my ticket out of here.

01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:26.660
There's another way out.
Take it before it's too late.

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:28.240
You better back off.

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:30.000
Then shoot me.

01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:31.370
Dad.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.390
It's all right, Ellie.

01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:40.710
You step one more foot,
I'm gonna blow her face off.

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:45.220
Look. If you want a hostage,
you take me.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.980
- What, are you kidding?
- I got value, man.

01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:49.190
You got nothing.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.440
You got a hot bitch
and she's mine now.

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.640
I know where 1 60 million is stashed.

01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:57.180
Now you let the ladies go...

01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:00.050
-...and I'll cut you in.
- Don't play me.

01:13:00.130 --> 01:13:01.290
I'm not trying to play you.

01:13:01.450 --> 01:13:04.280
I'll tell you where it is,
I'll draw you a map. Come on, man.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:05.690
You're an inmate.

01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:08.300
I don't believe a goddamn thing
you're saying.

01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:12.220
And as a hostage you're useless.
I tell you what.

01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:15.350
When I get out of here,
I'll think about setting them free.

01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:18.920
Now, both of you,
get the fuck out of my way.

01:13:19.210 --> 01:13:23.070
- I can't let you do that, Cortez.
- Oh, you can and you will.

01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:25.770
Dad! Dad!

01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:29.480
Why, you motherfucker- -

01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:39.280
Move!

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:47.620
Go, go, go.

01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:03.930
Move.

01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:23.420
- Cortez!
- Dad! Dad!

01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:24.660
Shut up!

01:15:16.410 --> 01:15:17.460
Dad!

01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:36.230
Sorry about your dad.

01:15:41.210 --> 01:15:43.400
You ain't going nowhere, fool.

01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:45.780
- Fucker, get out of my way.
- Get your ass in there.

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:46.870
- Fuck.
- Get your ass in- -

01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:48.000
What?

01:15:48.150 --> 01:15:49.950
Wanna throw people
through windows?

01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:53.410
- Get your ass that way. Go.
- Fuck.

01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:54.930
I should pop you right now.

01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:58.400
No, I should whoop your ass first,
then pop it.

01:15:58.460 --> 01:15:59.550
Bernard.

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:44.370
Dad, stop. You're gonna kill him.

01:16:45.190 --> 01:16:46.680
Dad.

01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:51.280
- Are you okay, baby?
- Yeah.

01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:53.580
- Let's go, let's go.
- Come on.

01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:57.830
- You all right, man?
- I'm alive, dude.

01:16:57.890 --> 01:17:00.830
Eric, you guys get Cortez inside
right now.

01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:07.750
Everything okay?

01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:14.080
I ought to throw you two guys
in solitary, pulling a stunt like that.

01:17:14.210 --> 01:17:18.120
Burke, Twitch, let's go.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:20.780
- Let's go inside.
- Dad.

01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:24.210
It's gonna be all right, baby.

01:17:24.330 --> 01:17:26.820
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:31.360
I'm getting out soon, now, you hear?

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:34.660
- You wait for me, now.
- I always do.

01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:38.080
Let's go.

01:17:43.690 --> 01:17:45.090
Let's go.

01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:52.700
And every word of it's true. I swear.

01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:54.540
Just ask the warden.

01:17:55.340 --> 01:18:01.300
I can verify that Bernard Washington
did in fact try to defuse the riot...

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:05.530
...and is one of two men responsible
for the rescue of the hostages.

01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:07.520
The other one was Burke.

01:18:07.630 --> 01:18:09.430
He helped with the saving thing too.

01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:12.810
I remind you again that this is
your parole hearing, not Mr. Burke's.

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.840
I know. I just wanted
to put that on record.

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:18.860
For when it's his turn
to spin that parole wheel.

01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:20.550
You sure about what you saw?

01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:26.160
Well, we've heard the account
of your supposed bravery...

01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:27.310
...from Warden Wallace.

01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:28.990
And we've taken
into consideration...

01:18:29.130 --> 01:18:31.160
...the years you've served
in New Alcatraz.

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:35.340
Except for a few minor infractions.

01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:39.140
And we hereby grant you your parole.

01:18:42.190 --> 01:18:44.160
Are you serious?

01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:48.810
Thank you. Thank you.

01:18:55.890 --> 01:18:58.120
Thank you, thank you.

01:18:58.230 --> 01:18:59.780
- Congratulations, Twitch.
- Thank you.

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:02.410
- Good luck, man.
- Yeah.

01:19:02.770 --> 01:19:04.670
Now keep that nose clean.

01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:07.020
Ain't got to worry about me.

01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:10.930
Bernard. Bernard!

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.020
Okay. I mean, come on.

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.550
Really, I ain't got no time for games.
What's up?

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.540
- Where is it?
- Just- -

01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:22.750
I see that big old box,
where is the gold?

01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:25.000
- I don't see it.
- Shut up and just help me.

01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:27.300
Help you? You big enough
to help yourself.

01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:28.850
Just grab it. Ready?

01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:31.380
Here we go.

01:19:33.370 --> 01:19:35.600
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:38.040
- Baby. Is it- -?
- Shit.

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:42.160
It's gold. It's really here, baby.

01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:44.970
You did it. Baby.

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:48.380
I can't believe it. You did it.

01:19:50.010 --> 01:19:51.980
Twitch.

01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:56.970
Twitch.

01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:06.050
- We rich, baby.
- We rich. We rich.

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:11.530
- What?
- We better get this out of here quick.

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.670
- Look at this.
- Let me count my money.

01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:16.660
- Oh, it's your money, Bernard?
- Yeah, it's my money.

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:18.060
That's what I'm talking about.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.170
Just bring the money to the car.
Hurry up.

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:23.050
- You wouldn't help me dig, wouldn't- - 
- I ain't helping nothing.

01:20:23.130 --> 01:20:25.460
When you was in the jail,
you was crying like girl.

01:20:25.570 --> 01:20:27.500
I risked my life for you
and you wouldn't help.

01:20:27.610 --> 01:20:28.840
Help me get this out of here.

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:30.850
Get your ass back here.

01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:37.640
- Dude, you look tight.
- Thanks, this is my Snoop Dogg look.

01:20:37.730 --> 01:20:40.630
I'm gonna tell you something.
You put this in your pocket, right?

01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:42.930
Don't give it to your ma or pa
and don't buy no drugs.

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:45.870
You'll be all right. Go on, now.
You enjoy yourself, boy.

01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:47.650
- Hey.
- Hey, Twitch. Hey, Cherise.

01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:49.330
Hey, Burke.

01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:50.960
What's up?

01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:53.370
Same old, man. How about you?

01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:56.330
You don't notice nothing different
about your boy?

01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:58.080
You know, come to think of it...

01:20:58.210 --> 01:21:00.910
...you are a hell of a lot uglier.

01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:03.750
- Not funny. What you laughing at?
- Very funny.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:07.280
If 80 million will make you this ugly,
you need a facelift.

01:21:07.330 --> 01:21:09.350
- Only 80?
- Well, actually it was more.

01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:11.410
We put the other 80
into a separate account.

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:13.820
- For you.
- Eighty million?

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:17.760
- Well, shit. It wasn't my idea.
- Yes, it was. Stop lying.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:20.320
Eighty million dollars?

01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:22.940
You gotta keep that on the low,
they might think I stole it.

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.600
Keep it on the low.

01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:27.540
- I don't know what to say, guys.
- We owed you, Burke.

01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:29.490
You make sure you push
some of that up, now.

01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:33.340
You got that beautiful little daughter
of yours. Now, college is a killer.

01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:36.310
Don't you worry, guys. I will.

01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:39.880
- You gonna be okay in here?
- I'm gonna be just fine, darling.

01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:41.380
He transferred Cortez.

01:21:43.170 --> 01:21:45.730
See, that's what that boy get.
Something was wrong with him.

01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:47.730
He had a real serious problem,
you know?

01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:49.710
But check this out, I had an idea.

01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:51.760
How would you like it
if I got your daughter...

01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:53.780
...and brought her to you
for Christmas?

01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:56.990
- Bernard.
- You guys don't have to do that, now.

01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:58.120
Oh, that's not far at all.

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.340
Missouri is a hop,
skip and a jump away...

01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:02.360
...when you're in first class.

01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:05.740
Now, you know we supposed
to go see Mama for Christmas.

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:09.500
Like I said, it sounds like a great idea
to come here for Christmas.

01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:11.540
Oh, don't you disrespect
my mama like that.

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:15.960
I said we gonna take his daughter here
to see him, that's what we're gonna do.

01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:18.000
No, we not.
Not on no Christmas, we ain't.

01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:20.220
I don't know who you think you are.
Stop calling- -

01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:22.660
How many times I gotta tell you
to stop calling me "woman"?

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:24.130
- You all high and mighty.
- What's your problem?

01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:26.260
You ain't got no bling like me.
You been trouble.

01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:28.510
- You should've never called me.
- I should've never called.

01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:30.210
Ever since you put on this little hat- -

01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:31.540
- Anyway, Burke.
- We're going- -

01:22:31.690 --> 01:22:33.630
You don't talk to me like that.

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:36.340
Man, I don't wanna talk to you.
You ain't got no say in this.

01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:38.900
- I know- - 
- Whatever. Whatever.
