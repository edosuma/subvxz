01:20.400 --> 01:22.641
What do I think love is?

01:24.280 --> 01:27.807
Uh, it's like when someone makes
your stomach feel all tight...

01:27.880 --> 01:30.611
but floaty at the same time, you know?

01:31.720 --> 01:34.610
And your cheeks hurt from smiling.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.569
You smile so much...

01:36.640 --> 01:38.802
that people think somethings
wrong with you.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.405
Love is light.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.688
Acceptance.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.570
Fire.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.165
Pain.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.805
Horrible pain.

01:54.360 --> 01:56.124
That you want again and again.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.089
And also fucking.

01:58.160 --> 02:02.370
24-7, deep-dick, can't-walk-right fucking.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.250
Oh, you know me.

02:05.320 --> 02:08.767
I got so much to say about love.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.641
And one year, this Wall Street guy...

02:14.720 --> 02:17.007
flew me in a helicopter to DC.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.605
For serious?

02:18.680 --> 02:21.923
Valentine's Day makes guys go crazy.
They love it.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.889
Men hate Valentine's Day.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.405
They don't act like they hate it.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.562
That's because you look
like Sofía Vergara.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.530
Them things is real.
I once saw her jogging in Tribeca.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.921
Ian hasn't visited in so long.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.968
It'd be nice if he showed up tomorrow.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.929
But he's only got a Vespa...

02:38.000 --> 02:39.968
and it's too cold to ride this far.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.849
One year, Yadriel got me flowers.

02:41.920 --> 02:45.208
He stole them from his cousin's funeral.
It was so sweet.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.884
Please. Valentine's Day was invented...

02:46.960 --> 02:49.964
to make people feel like shit if they're
not part of some perfect couple.

02:50.040 --> 02:53.169
- True. - Diablo says there
are no perfect couples...

02:53.240 --> 02:55.811
but each couple is perfect in its own way.

02:57.280 --> 03:00.443
It must be hard being locked up
on Valentine's Day.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.645
That's all.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.722
Aw. Thank you, Fischer.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.689
That was really empathetic of you.

03:06.760 --> 03:09.650
- You want a cookie?
- Oh, sure. Thank you.

03:11.600 --> 03:19.600
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

03:21.000 --> 03:24.083
- You need some water, Fischer?
- I'll be fine.

03:25.240 --> 03:28.926
I knew she didn't swallow.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.529
Hi.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.524
Where'd you make
reservations for tomorrow night?

03:44.520 --> 03:45.726
What?

03:45.800 --> 03:49.202
Shh. I'm trying to pretend
like we're a normal couple.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.284
Oh. Um...

03:52.360 --> 03:56.081
well, I got us
a table for two at Lorenzo's.

03:56.160 --> 03:57.650
The one by the fireplace.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.525
I can't wait for you to see my dress.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.206
It's sexy, but not slutty. You know.

04:05.960 --> 04:07.450
I can't wait to see it.

04:08.680 --> 04:12.207
<i>Mamita.</i> Uh, can you get me
another bag of flour?

04:18.200 --> 04:19.406
Here.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.610
What's this?

04:21.680 --> 04:23.409
It's a list.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.721
Wanna keep the mother-in-law happy, right?

04:25.800 --> 04:29.122
I figured I might as well
make use of Sleepy Hollow...

04:29.200 --> 04:30.929
before the other shoe drops.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.530
Get it?

04:38.520 --> 04:42.127
So this is what Vee negotiated for us-
using these broke-ass showers?

04:42.200 --> 04:44.521
- Man, that's some broke-ass negotiating.
- You think?

04:44.600 --> 04:46.967
You do know that long showers
are bad for you.

04:47.040 --> 04:51.762
Yeah. Yeah. Mess with
your keratinocytes and whatnot.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.161
Hey, Suzanne. Shut the fuck up.

04:58.200 --> 05:02.410
Man, why the hell would I leave the
library? It's the best job here.

05:02.480 --> 05:03.970
Because books do not pay the rent.

05:04.040 --> 05:07.487
Books do not bourguignonne the beef.
We are startin' something.

05:07.560 --> 05:10.404
I don't wanna join custodial.

05:10.480 --> 05:12.050
And yet I am still asking you.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.122
No way. No.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.521
Do you know how easy
it would have been for me to say no...

05:19.600 --> 05:21.921
when you said,
“Vee, get me out of this group home...

05:22.000 --> 05:25.891
save me from the sick,
fuck-faced foster father I got”?

05:25.960 --> 05:27.041
Huh?

05:27.120 --> 05:28.724
It's not fair.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.768
Fair? Girl, please.

05:30.840 --> 05:34.367
Fair is where you go get you some cotton
candy, where you ride the tilt-a-whirl.

05:34.440 --> 05:36.363
I'm looking for Jack.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.290
He's not here.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.164
He buys me chocolates every year.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.765
We're on a fixed income, of course...

05:42.840 --> 05:46.242
but he's got to treat his Duckie right,
he says.

05:46.320 --> 05:50.325
And if he can't find me,
they'll be wasted.

05:53.600 --> 05:57.207
Fuck. Kill me in my sleep
if I ever get like that.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.169
Look, you gonna think about it, right?

05:59.240 --> 06:02.164
And then you gonna do as I say.

06:02.240 --> 06:03.207
Aah!

06:03.280 --> 06:05.681
It's just chillin', you know?

06:05.800 --> 06:08.280
Kickin' it with somebody, talking...

06:08.360 --> 06:10.806
making mad stupid jokes.

06:10.880 --> 06:16.410
And, like, not even
wanting to go to sleep 'cause...

06:16.520 --> 06:19.205
then you might be
without 'em for a minute.

06:19.280 --> 06:21.169
And you don't want that.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.926
Mmm.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.809
And... done.

06:35.880 --> 06:38.087
Ah, who's next? Who's next?

06:38.160 --> 06:39.650
Whoo!

06:46.680 --> 06:49.001
Get a room!

06:49.080 --> 06:51.287
German, fool. Talk it.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.124
<i>Zing? Zinger?</i>

06:53.200 --> 06:56.647
<i>Das Zimmer.</i> You're part of a community.
Respect its language.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.210
My father's part of a community.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.965
I'm the unfortunate
appendage he drags about...

07:01.040 --> 07:03.850
wherever your fight
against terror takes him.

07:06.240 --> 07:08.891
How many times have you had to move
in your short little life?

07:08.960 --> 07:11.930
Too many.
But this is the end of the road.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.729
My pops promised.

07:15.240 --> 07:17.129
How do you say “I'd like to watch...

07:17.200 --> 07:21.728
as you two make sweet,
sweet lady love” in German?

07:21.800 --> 07:24.883
<i>Nein,</i> motherfucker. <i>Nein.</i>

07:32.200 --> 07:33.964
This job is bullshit.

07:34.040 --> 07:37.283
No. 'Tis a rewarding puzzle.

07:37.360 --> 07:42.082
Ain't no puzzle.
Makes electrical look good.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.845
I can't believe I let that old bitch
talk me into this.

07:44.920 --> 07:48.129
I wouldn't speak ill
of Miss Parker's methods.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.884
She wouldn't tolerate such words.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.531
Hey. Now, Watson got the right...

07:52.600 --> 07:55.171
to express her discomfort for her new job.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.208
Just because cleaning
quiets your discombobulation...

07:57.280 --> 07:59.328
doesn't mean it does so for everyone.

07:59.400 --> 08:03.166
Point well made, Moppet. Point well made.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.163
You such a dumb-ass.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.641
Hey, Watson. You look a little tired.

08:11.760 --> 08:14.331
Maybe I could come by later
and massage your quads.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.687
Get the fuck outta here.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.808
Whatever y'all got going on in here-

08:18.880 --> 08:21.167
taking over custodial- I want a piece.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.129
I use it to cover my eyes.

08:23.200 --> 08:26.682
That way, you know, I won't see anything.

08:26.760 --> 08:32.289
Tomorrow night, I am going to put the “V”
in your Valentine.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.803
That's right. Fuck me.

08:35.880 --> 08:39.645
Hey, Warren, who gonna be
your Valentine this year?

08:39.720 --> 08:42.563
You always battin'
them freaky blacks at somebody.

08:42.640 --> 08:48.010
No, no. This year,
I'm lovin' someone who deserves me- me.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.010
Loser.

08:51.080 --> 08:53.162
- Shut up.
- Whatever.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.208
Depressing-ass time of year, you ask me.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.805
Motherfucker!

08:57.840 --> 08:59.330
Shit!

08:59.400 --> 09:01.164
You pissed your pants?

09:03.320 --> 09:05.322
I'm-a go find you a diaper.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.890
<i>Your attention, please.
Visiting hours are now open.</i>

09:09.960 --> 09:13.328
<i>All prisoners are free
to go to the visiting room.</i>

09:16.040 --> 09:18.407
Tomorrow's
Florence Henderson's birthday.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.960
- What?
- Valentine's Day.

09:21.080 --> 09:22.605
Florence Henderson's birthday.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.650
We should be having our annual naked
Brady-thon celebration...

09:25.720 --> 09:28.371
and I should be doing some kind of a
striptease to “Sunshine Day”...

09:28.440 --> 09:31.842
and then maybe something- maybe something
with... Wesson oil, if that-

09:31.920 --> 09:33.206
Piper.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.611
Hmm?

09:35.720 --> 09:37.484
Hi.

09:39.320 --> 09:40.845
Hi.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.410
Hi.

09:46.640 --> 09:48.642
I heard about your grandma.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.405
Larry.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.209
I want my home.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.722
When I get out of here...

10:02.440 --> 10:04.044
I wanna come home.

10:05.880 --> 10:08.360
That's quite the statement.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.570
You sure about that?

10:16.040 --> 10:17.963
Yeah.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.530
I'm sure.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.762
Well, I'm not asking <i>you.</i>

10:24.560 --> 10:26.562
I'm asking future Piper...

10:27.480 --> 10:29.642
free Piper.

10:29.720 --> 10:32.405
Can you guarantee that you still will?

10:32.480 --> 10:35.051
Future Piper hopes so.

10:36.840 --> 10:39.730
Present Larry can't live on hope.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.690
Wasabi peas and peanut butter
pretzels apparently, but not hope.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.649
Please don't mention those things...

10:44.720 --> 10:46.848
unless you're hiding some
up your butt for me.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.928
Piper.

10:53.680 --> 10:58.242
This, uh- This reporter from <i>City Post,</i>
Andrew Nance...

10:58.320 --> 11:03.929
he, um- he asked me about
financial irregularities here.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.244
Uh, vendors that don't exist,
buildings that were never built.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.721
And I was like, “Fuck that.”

11:10.800 --> 11:13.883
Why should he write it? I'll write it.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.724
Write what?

11:15.800 --> 11:17.529
An article-

11:17.600 --> 11:20.683
with you investigating from the inside.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.969
Freedom of the press shouldn't only be
a privilege of the free, right?

11:24.040 --> 11:25.769
- Oh, my God.
- What do you say?

11:25.840 --> 11:30.323
Oh, my God. Larry. Jesus Christ.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.845
- What?
- You're doing it again.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.883
What are you talking about?

11:33.960 --> 11:37.009
We'll- We'll fucking expose
this place, Piper.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.048
You're the moon, Larry.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.361
You have got to stop being the moon.

11:41.440 --> 11:44.523
- What's wrong with being the moon?
- It doesn't have its own light.

11:44.640 --> 11:48.281
Right. So what, that-
What, that makes you the sun?

11:48.360 --> 11:50.328
Are you the sun, Piper?

11:50.400 --> 11:52.084
Huh? You're the center
of the solar system...

11:52.160 --> 11:55.209
and I'm just a dead hunk of crap rock?

11:55.280 --> 11:57.567
How am I supposed to become
my own planet, Piper...

11:57.640 --> 12:01.087
when your shit is still everywhere?

12:01.160 --> 12:03.925
Huh? You get to move on.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.291
You get to fuck Alex
or- or whoever's next, and I am stuck.

12:09.360 --> 12:13.490
I'm stuck with your-your-
your sweaters and your shoes...

12:13.560 --> 12:18.088
and your goddamn Sephora
fucking outlet store worth of products.

12:18.160 --> 12:20.288
You are everywhere.

12:22.360 --> 12:25.887
It's like living inside a-a sarcophagus.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.726
Well, take my stuff to Polly's
if it's so in your way.

12:32.520 --> 12:36.081
- And you mean “mausoleum,” not
“sarcophagus.” - Don't tell me what I mean!

12:42.040 --> 12:44.486
At least people can walk on the moon.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.560
Anyone gets near the sun,
they burn right up.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.962
Vee says she's too old.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.566
Don't believe it for a second.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.608
What that woman did to me-

13:01.680 --> 13:03.364
People don't change.

13:03.440 --> 13:06.011
Hurry it up, will you!

13:06.080 --> 13:08.367
I'm trying, Ma.
The sparks are burning my cheeks.

13:08.440 --> 13:11.171
Then turn your head. Where's your brother?

13:11.240 --> 13:13.208
He got claustrophobic.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.567
He's in the woods guarding the entrance.

13:15.640 --> 13:18.246
I'm just so sad, <i>Mamushka.</i>

13:18.320 --> 13:19.970
I'm sorry she left you, Vasily...

13:20.040 --> 13:22.611
but I'm sure you
did something to deserve it.

13:22.680 --> 13:24.569
I used to watch her sleep...

13:24.640 --> 13:28.884
and pray for the strength
to stop ruining everything, Ma.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.361
And how did that work out for you?

13:31.440 --> 13:34.569
Oh, no work today. Come back tomorrow.

13:34.640 --> 13:38.008
- Well, Jack said he would be out here.
- I saw him get into a taxi.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.969
A taxi?

13:41.080 --> 13:42.684
Out here?

13:42.800 --> 13:44.529
Imagine that.

13:44.600 --> 13:47.206
Thank you, young lady.

13:48.400 --> 13:52.086
Hurry it up, will you!

14:02.240 --> 14:04.686
- Mama!
- You and your disgusting whining.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.491
If you want your woman back,
go get her.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.050
Now hand up the shit.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.205
Come on!

14:14.640 --> 14:17.371
- When you get out of here-
- Mm-hmm.

14:17.440 --> 14:20.125
Who do you imagine yourself
going home to?

14:20.200 --> 14:22.123
Fiona Apple in the “Criminal” video.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.884
Ah.

14:23.960 --> 14:27.089
Stupid question. What about you?

14:28.120 --> 14:29.724
I always thought it would be Larry...

14:29.800 --> 14:32.451
but I think it's time to reimagine.

14:32.520 --> 14:36.684
This stupid fuckin' holiday.

14:36.760 --> 14:40.685
Listen. If you want,
I can help you forget what day it is.

14:40.760 --> 14:44.321
- Yeah, or your name, for that matter.
- You know, no.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.528
I am not interested in being a prize-

14:46.600 --> 14:49.922
albeit a shockingly undervalued one-

14:50.000 --> 14:53.288
- in your little sex game.
- Fine.

14:53.360 --> 14:59.049
I lost my manipulative,
gorgeous, psychopath ex...

14:59.120 --> 15:03.250
and my sweet, kind...

15:03.320 --> 15:06.483
unfocused fiancé.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.048
I don't have a home anymore.

15:10.120 --> 15:11.565
Yeah, Chapman. You do.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.049
This shitpile!

15:15.120 --> 15:16.963
Home, sweet home.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.565
Look, I gotta say...

15:18.640 --> 15:20.927
your unfocused fiancé's
on the right track with this article shit.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.209
This is, like, my 20th time trying to fix
the short in this panel alone.

15:24.280 --> 15:25.805
Nobody's spending money here.

15:28.280 --> 15:29.964
Hey.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.804
Gallego said you were looking for me.

15:31.880 --> 15:35.930
Oh, Joe.
These phone calls- they're amazing.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.684
Listen.

15:37.760 --> 15:41.207
<i>I said to keep
an eye on him, not fuck him.</i>

15:41.280 --> 15:43.487
<i>It was only in the ass. It don't count.</i>

15:43.560 --> 15:45.369
<i>- I'm telling Mom.</i>
- Whoa.

15:45.440 --> 15:48.603
I know. Anyway,
it's so interesting, all these lives.

15:48.680 --> 15:51.331
- It's like reading Dickens.
- That's good.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.482
Showing initiative.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.847
Maybe it'll help get Fig off my ass.

15:55.920 --> 16:00.164
She asked me to impose a shot quota.
It's ridiculous.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.766
I love that you stand up to her.

16:05.200 --> 16:08.886
So, how are things going with, um-

16:08.960 --> 16:10.644
What's his name?

16:10.720 --> 16:14.805
They're not... going.
He wore a lot of vests.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.609
Ah.

16:16.680 --> 16:19.650
Well, that- that happens. You-

16:19.720 --> 16:23.247
You know, I- I play in this band.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.891
You're in a band? Wow.

16:25.960 --> 16:29.521
Yeah? Yeah.

16:29.600 --> 16:32.171
It's no big deal. I-

16:32.240 --> 16:35.961
We play in town tomorrow night.
You wanna come?

16:36.040 --> 16:38.771
Oh, I'm working the Valentine's party.

16:40.520 --> 16:42.090
I'll get you off.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.570
I'll-I'll get you off the schedule.

16:45.640 --> 16:47.369
Uh, I- I-

16:47.440 --> 16:49.966
I-I can get your shift covered.
l-It's fine.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.008
Well, I do love music.

16:52.080 --> 16:54.765
- That'd be awesome. Thanks.
- Great.

16:56.520 --> 16:59.330
- I'll see you there then.
- Okay.

17:03.320 --> 17:08.201
I had this thing with my boss
at Long John Silver's...

17:08.280 --> 17:11.522
and then I found out
his wife was wicked hot.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.691
That was nice.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.047
“How do you know I'm mad?” said Alice.

17:18.119 --> 17:21.920
“You must be,” said the cat,
or you wouldn't have come here.”

17:22.000 --> 17:25.242
Mmm. Shit. You right.

17:25.319 --> 17:27.925
Lewis Carroll must have gone to prison.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.201
R.J.'s mom was named Alice.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.846
Oh, yeah? She fall down a rabbit hole?

17:33.920 --> 17:36.207
- Nah, a crack hole.
- Ah.

17:36.280 --> 17:39.124
She found a little rock
said “Smoke me” on it.

17:39.200 --> 17:42.647
That's-
That's not funny. That shit was serious.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.001
“Smoke me.” Man, you a dumb-ass.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.447
Jefferson,
say good-bye. You're on custodial now.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.045
Already?

17:50.120 --> 17:51.770
Wait. You leavin?

17:51.880 --> 17:53.484
Yeah.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.961
Remember I told you
Vee was gettin' something together?

17:56.040 --> 17:58.930
But why would you leave the library, man?
You know you love it here.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.490
You don't understand.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.004
I owe her.

18:04.560 --> 18:07.245
She could probably get you transferred,
I bet.

18:07.320 --> 18:11.803
Nah. Nah, I know when I got it good.

18:12.880 --> 18:14.564
Yeah, okay.

18:14.640 --> 18:17.530
Well, I'll see you at dinner.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.450
Sorry.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.330
Okay.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.242
Yeah?

21:28.720 --> 21:31.041
- Just this.
- It's on the list.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.690
It's fucking vapor.

21:32.760 --> 21:36.526
Give me a break, Eliqua. Caputo's up my
ass today. Put it in your car.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.443
Next.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.725
Pat-downs are mandatory now.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.123
I'm just kidding.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.771
I don't wanna touch that peg-leg shit.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.002
Happy Valentine's Day.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.570
Next.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.565
Look at this shit.

22:24.280 --> 22:27.090
You're lucky you're pretty.
You know that, right?

22:28.280 --> 22:30.521
What does that one say?

22:30.600 --> 22:34.810
Ian. In case he shows up today.
I'm stupid.

22:41.880 --> 22:44.451
I'm so glad we're family.

23:01.240 --> 23:04.050
Happy Valentine's Day.

23:04.120 --> 23:05.610
Thanks.

23:07.640 --> 23:10.883
Are you cooking up
something special for me today?

23:10.960 --> 23:12.928
The house smells great.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.287
That's what you're gonna expect me to do?

23:15.360 --> 23:18.807
Cook for you, be your little housewife,
huh? It's not happening.

23:18.880 --> 23:22.202
No, no. I- I thought we were playing the-

23:22.280 --> 23:23.725
I don't care if you cook.

23:23.800 --> 23:28.362
Sorry. I've just been depressed today.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.841
I don't wanna play
the normal game anymore.

23:30.920 --> 23:34.003
'Cause I don't know how
we ever are gonna be normal.

23:39.480 --> 23:41.767
Just so you know, counselors
can be a great resource...

23:41.840 --> 23:44.446
if you need to talk or cry or something.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.761
- Who'd you get?
- Healy.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.365
- Oh.
- What's wrong?

23:48.440 --> 23:52.240
Nothing. I just get the sense
that none of the girls really like him.

23:52.320 --> 23:54.721
But you're tough. You'll be fine.

23:56.320 --> 24:00.962
Have you noticed we've been blowing a lot
of fuses around here lately?

24:01.040 --> 24:03.042
You're just noticing
this place is falling apart?

24:03.120 --> 24:06.090
Doesn't the prison have a budget
for infrastructure?

24:06.160 --> 24:08.049
Sure.

24:08.120 --> 24:11.408
And what happened to the electrical budget
from last quarter?

24:11.480 --> 24:15.530
It went to upgrading the “A” block grid
and loading-dock panel.

24:15.640 --> 24:18.405
- Really? We did that?
- That's what the budget report says.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.608
- So we did it?
- Okay.

24:20.680 --> 24:22.125
- So it happened?
- Why not?

24:22.200 --> 24:24.043
I don't understand.

24:24.120 --> 24:26.441
Trust me, you don't want to.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.648
Congratulations. Hour's up.

24:28.720 --> 24:31.564
You just earned another 11 cents.

24:36.640 --> 24:41.089
All right, everybody. Dolphin pose.

24:48.760 --> 24:50.842
I think I can help you
with the dolphin pose.

24:50.920 --> 24:53.287
The trick is to make sure
that your pelvic basin-

24:53.360 --> 24:55.249
Get away from me.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.771
No way. Thanks, Red.

25:18.680 --> 25:21.331
Red. Bless you.

25:23.120 --> 25:25.646
<i>Laundry now available for pickup.</i>

25:25.720 --> 25:29.611
Now let's return to dolphin pose.

25:31.920 --> 25:33.410
Kukicha tea.

25:36.440 --> 25:37.965
Well, look who's back.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.689
Sorry to interrupt, girls.

25:43.760 --> 25:46.240
Continue with your... dolphins.

25:50.960 --> 25:53.122
Just bagged a four-pointer.

26:00.040 --> 26:01.565
We're almost tied.

26:04.360 --> 26:05.646
Listen up.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.606
This angry nonsense has to stop.

26:11.320 --> 26:14.051
We're going to need each other soon.

26:14.120 --> 26:15.804
All of us.

26:27.840 --> 26:30.241
<i>Medical staff,
report to the visitation hall.</i>

26:30.320 --> 26:32.163
I'm not kidding, Nicky.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.441
We have to stick together.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.761
We're stronger together.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.922
So you try to buy their love back?

26:41.760 --> 26:43.410
Thanks, Red.

26:52.960 --> 26:56.328
Why- Why are you asking me that?

26:56.400 --> 26:58.971
You- You shouldn't be talking to me.

27:00.280 --> 27:02.123
You shouldn't be.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.089
Fourteen foot powders.

27:04.160 --> 27:05.685
Check.

27:05.760 --> 27:08.604
- Twenty Effergrips.
- Check that.

27:08.680 --> 27:10.842
Remember when we sold smokes?

27:10.920 --> 27:13.685
God, I swear I'm gonna vote Libertarian.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.842
I've gotta run to my car.
I'll be right back.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.402
Mind if I step out for a moment?

27:24.480 --> 27:26.482
I don't give a shit.

27:32.120 --> 27:34.009
Let me guess.

27:34.080 --> 27:36.731
“Yo, Vee, I'm just so mad...

27:36.840 --> 27:39.525
since y'all got Taystee
transferred to custodial.

27:39.600 --> 27:43.446
Just left me in the library
with my titties in my hand.”

27:44.120 --> 27:45.645
Close?

27:45.720 --> 27:49.725
Nah. You left out, "If you get her in
trouble, I'll kill you."

27:52.440 --> 27:53.930
- Really?
- You bet.

27:55.280 --> 27:57.886
- And how would you kill me?
- I'll figure it out.

27:57.960 --> 28:01.407
I know she thinks she owes you.

28:01.480 --> 28:05.565
But from what I heard,
you're just a bully...

28:05.640 --> 28:08.484
who uses lost kids for her own shit...

28:08.560 --> 28:10.801
and then dumps 'em
as soon as the heat comes down.

28:10.880 --> 28:13.247
You're a fucking vampire.

28:13.320 --> 28:15.004
There was this kid growing up.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.447
His name was Haro Jones.

28:19.560 --> 28:21.324
Oh, he had these arms.

28:21.400 --> 28:26.770
I just wanted to lick
the length of his arms.

28:26.840 --> 28:31.243
Then one day, I walked into the park...

28:31.320 --> 28:34.927
find his hand up Jamela Larkin's skirt.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.729
Broke my poor fool heart.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.406
Look, lady, I don't give a fuck
about your little stories and-

28:39.480 --> 28:42.006
Taystee...

28:42.080 --> 28:44.367
will...

28:44.440 --> 28:46.169
never...

28:46.240 --> 28:48.971
love... you.

28:50.120 --> 28:52.407
She will never love you.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.645
Not the way you want.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.721
Yo, I don't want her like that.

29:05.880 --> 29:09.805
I'm just looking out for her. That's all.

29:11.760 --> 29:15.287
<i>Corrections officers to “B” block.</i>

29:15.360 --> 29:17.840
<i>Corrections officers to “B” block.</i>

29:27.720 --> 29:32.362
Yo, Pops, some fucking Chinese soldiers
was just smoking right outside my window.

29:37.120 --> 29:38.770
I'm so sorry.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.564
What? Where's Mom?

29:40.640 --> 29:42.563
She's fine.

29:42.640 --> 29:45.120
We're being transferred
back to the States.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.363
I don't know why, but... we are.

29:50.240 --> 29:52.004
What?

29:52.080 --> 29:53.605
I'm sorry.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.327
I let you both down, P.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.762
I don't know what to say.

30:17.560 --> 30:19.085
All right.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.290
Jesus.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.410
You're out of bounds, Chapman.

30:47.760 --> 30:50.843
Well, I won't tell if you don't.

30:50.920 --> 30:53.685
<i>All first-level
trustees check in for kitchen duty.</i>

30:53.760 --> 30:55.762
Treating us like we're prisoners.

30:57.720 --> 31:03.363
Hey. You know, I heard
that there were plans to build a gym here.

31:03.440 --> 31:06.330
- Do you know what ever happened to that?
- What always happens.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.402
I'll take it from here.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.883
Just looking for a faulty wire.

31:14.960 --> 31:18.009
Then why are you
asking Maxwell about a gym?

31:18.080 --> 31:20.367
From what I hear,
you're full of questions lately.

31:20.480 --> 31:25.850
You know that I have always been interested
in the health and safety of others.

31:25.920 --> 31:28.161
I'm trying to help you with your nana.

31:28.280 --> 31:31.329
So, again, why are you
asking all these questions?

31:40.160 --> 31:43.164
Freedom of the press shouldn't only be
a privilege of the free.

31:44.520 --> 31:47.285
What the fuck does that mean?

31:47.360 --> 31:49.647
What does the press have
anything to do with this?

31:52.680 --> 31:54.682
I'm starting a prison newsletter.

31:54.760 --> 31:56.888
- A newsletter?
- A newsletter.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.570
A newsletter.

31:59.640 --> 32:04.726
Written by the prisoners
with, um, articles...

32:04.800 --> 32:07.007
and op-ed pieces.

32:07.080 --> 32:10.527
That is why I've been trying to get out of
my bubble and get to know this place.

32:10.600 --> 32:14.161
We- This- This is our home.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.126
We should all be communicating more.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.770
Inmates, guards...

32:19.840 --> 32:22.081
administration.

32:22.160 --> 32:28.008
This could really,
really help us get to know each other...

32:28.080 --> 32:30.890
and this place better.

32:33.000 --> 32:37.085
Pending your approval, of course...

32:38.880 --> 32:42.771
Mr. Editor In Chief.

32:42.840 --> 32:44.365
Don't oversell it.

32:50.920 --> 32:52.888
- A newsletter.
-Mmm.

32:54.320 --> 32:57.210
Okay. I'm not saying yes.

32:58.480 --> 33:00.528
Show me some sample stories by tomorrow.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.126
Tomorrow? Sure. Okay. Yeah.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.402
The girls used to like me.

33:10.920 --> 33:12.570
They will again.

33:15.720 --> 33:18.200
Hey, hey, hey. How my girls doin'?

33:23.400 --> 33:25.084
Ooh.

33:25.160 --> 33:27.527
Why you got your famous pouty face on?

33:27.600 --> 33:30.888
I don't understand what you're doing.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.247
Yeah, and how many times
have you not understood my methods...

33:33.320 --> 33:35.322
only to have everything be made clear?

33:35.400 --> 33:37.641
Yeah, like when the cops were after R.J.?

33:37.720 --> 33:41.088
Goddamn. You done gone
for the nuclear option early.

33:41.160 --> 33:43.925
Why don't you ever wanna talk about R.J.?

33:44.040 --> 33:46.805
Because it's in the past, girl.
I live in the now.

33:46.920 --> 33:48.570
So should you.

33:48.640 --> 33:52.565
All damn day, I've been scrubbing toilets,
defending you.

33:52.640 --> 33:55.120
- And I don't even believe in you anymore.
- Taystee.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.601
No! You don't have a plan.

33:57.720 --> 34:00.724
You just wanna prove
that you can order me around.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.531
- But, nah, not anymore.
- Open the box.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.887
- What?
- Open the box.

34:12.120 --> 34:15.408
Man, I told you. I'm done cleaning.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.724
What are you doin'?

34:20.280 --> 34:22.601
What? Tobacco?

34:25.000 --> 34:28.607
But where's the cleanser?
Where-

34:48.000 --> 34:49.650
It's like getting into a bath.

34:49.719 --> 34:53.202
But the water is like
warm chocolate pudding.

34:53.320 --> 34:57.291
And The Smiths are playing
“There's a Light That Never Goes Out.”

34:57.360 --> 34:59.931
Oh. There's warm lighting all over...

35:00.000 --> 35:03.402
and there are, like,
five dudes massaging you.

35:03.480 --> 35:05.767
And you have a pizza.

35:05.840 --> 35:08.844
She's right.
And you also have a pizza.

35:14.800 --> 35:17.644
Hey, I got some hooch
from that Greek chick with the beard.

35:22.400 --> 35:25.006
- That's pretty good.
- Mm-hmm.

35:25.080 --> 35:26.809
Fischer's out today.

35:26.880 --> 35:30.282
Apparently having her woman time.

35:30.360 --> 35:32.806
Oh. Um, where's Joe?

35:32.880 --> 35:36.123
He's out too. Yeah.

35:36.200 --> 35:37.964
Let 'em have their stupid little party...

35:38.040 --> 35:39.610
and then don't put enough muscle on.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.409
So typical.

35:41.480 --> 35:43.960
Bronikowski, leave room for Jesus.

35:44.040 --> 35:46.566
I will shut this thing down
in a heartbeat.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.682
You know what's funny?

35:51.720 --> 35:54.849
I'm in a women's prison, but, um...

35:56.080 --> 35:58.401
I don't understand women at all.

35:58.480 --> 36:00.881
I'll tell you something
about women, Bennett.

36:00.960 --> 36:04.009
With women, you make 'em think
you're meeting them halfway...

36:04.080 --> 36:06.560
when really what you're doing
is you're meeting them...

36:06.640 --> 36:09.246
about 10 to 15 percent of the way.

36:10.760 --> 36:13.206
Women are really bad at math.

36:13.280 --> 36:14.930
Don't forget that.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.765
I won't, sir.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.924
- Did Jack call yet?
- Who?

36:37.480 --> 36:39.084
Listen, Daya.

36:39.160 --> 36:41.527
I know we can't be normal, but-

36:41.600 --> 36:43.204
Shh.

36:43.280 --> 36:46.284
Take me somewhere. Now.

36:55.640 --> 36:58.246
Wow. They're bigger.

37:02.040 --> 37:03.804
Let's go.

37:40.920 --> 37:42.445
What is this?

37:43.920 --> 37:45.445
Yo.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.690
Close your eyes.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.524
- What? Why?
- Close 'em.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.564
Open your lips.

37:58.680 --> 38:00.205
Less.

38:00.280 --> 38:01.406
- T.-
- Do it.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.165
What?

38:12.240 --> 38:14.208
What's this, a cigarette?

38:15.480 --> 38:17.244
We in business, P.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.402
Vee's got a whole sales plan.

38:19.480 --> 38:22.563
We gettin' paid! I told you.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.405
Next-level Mr. Miyagi shit, son.

38:25.480 --> 38:28.370
Yah, yah, yah, ya-yah!

39:20.600 --> 39:23.410
Well, that was unexpected.

39:23.480 --> 39:25.209
Sorry.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.282
I was in a mood before.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.601
You're the sweetest man.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.090
Here.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.364
Look at the dog.

39:45.960 --> 39:47.962
This is so great.

39:49.480 --> 39:51.528
So was this.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.841
Mmm. Here.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.329
Sneaky, sneaky man.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.641
See? We can be a normal couple.

40:06.720 --> 40:09.690
Except you misspelled “Valentine's.”

40:11.640 --> 40:13.165
No, I didn't.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.170
Mendez did.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.050
Hi.

40:34.520 --> 40:36.761
I was wondering if I could ask you
a few questions...

40:36.840 --> 40:38.569
for a newsletter we're starting.

40:38.640 --> 40:40.449
A newsletter.

40:40.520 --> 40:42.682
Okay. Good luck.

40:42.760 --> 40:47.766
So, since it's Valentine's Day...

40:47.880 --> 40:50.087
what is love to you?

40:50.160 --> 40:51.685
How would you define love?

40:51.800 --> 40:54.246
That's a retarded fucking question.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.689
Okay. Um-

40:59.280 --> 41:00.930
How about this?

41:01.960 --> 41:03.485
When was the last time...

41:03.560 --> 41:07.645
you saw any major plumbing work
being done around here?

41:07.720 --> 41:09.324
Hmm.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.131
'04, '05 maybe.

41:12.240 --> 41:13.924
'04 or '05.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.847
This fatso named Donna Cusio
broke three toilets in one week.

41:19.880 --> 41:22.042
It was a mess, man.

41:26.040 --> 41:27.530
I bet.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.245
Big, big woman.

41:31.640 --> 41:35.042
<i>Inmate 3429 to the infirmary.</i>

41:48.200 --> 41:52.444
I just wanted to call and wish you
a happy Valentine's Day.

42:05.760 --> 42:07.728
I learned that for you.

42:09.720 --> 42:12.041
I'm a good man, Katya.

42:13.440 --> 42:14.965
You'll see that.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.731
I'm gonna make you really proud...

42:18.800 --> 42:21.531
to be married to this big galoot.

42:21.640 --> 42:23.324
I swear to-

42:38.000 --> 42:40.048
The fuck you mean there's no Ferris?

42:40.160 --> 42:41.605
No, okay, hear me out.

42:41.680 --> 42:44.729
Ferris is just a projection
of Cameron's inability...

42:44.800 --> 42:46.290
to stand up to his domineering father.

42:46.360 --> 42:48.488
But here's the mind fuck.

42:48.560 --> 42:51.006
Cameron never actually leaves his room.

42:51.080 --> 42:53.128
Remember, he's sick.

42:53.200 --> 42:56.170
He invents this idealized self, Ferris...

42:56.240 --> 42:58.242
plus his, like, 30-year-old girlfriend...

42:58.320 --> 43:00.402
and then imagines this epic adventure...

43:00.480 --> 43:02.482
with car chases, parades...

43:02.600 --> 43:04.443
ball games, blah, blah, blah.

43:04.560 --> 43:06.767
So this day off
is actually just a day off...

43:06.840 --> 43:08.649
from his rigid coherence
to mind/body alignment-

43:08.720 --> 43:10.961
Would you please shut the fuck up?

43:12.720 --> 43:15.485
Sorry. It's just a theory I read.

43:18.480 --> 43:20.881
Next time, just sit on her face.
It shuts her right up.

43:20.960 --> 43:23.361
I'll keep that in mind.

43:39.520 --> 43:41.045
Why are you ignoring me?

43:43.320 --> 43:46.449
Why are you ignoring me?
Spit it out! Come on!

43:46.560 --> 43:48.961
Look, you've been
lording over this group...

43:49.040 --> 43:50.690
like some Hillary Clinton dictator.

43:50.760 --> 43:52.205
- What?
- And we wanna be a democracy.

43:52.280 --> 43:53.884
Are you calling me Hillary Clinton?

43:54.920 --> 43:57.321
If the pantsuit fits.

43:57.400 --> 44:00.051
Look, we're done with you. Right?

44:01.040 --> 44:03.771
Y'all are done with me?

44:03.840 --> 44:06.366
That's really funny.
That's really funny, Leanne.

44:06.440 --> 44:08.522
'Cause if I'm Hillary Clinton...

44:08.600 --> 44:12.491
then y'all must be some “sister-wife,
tweaker, Slurpee-drinkin'...

44:12.560 --> 44:14.324
fourth-grade-readin'-level...

44:14.400 --> 44:19.247
Daddy-on- Cops, trailer trash” nothin'.

44:19.320 --> 44:22.927
And you know what? It's okay, 'cause you
ain't even challenged me anyway.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.480
Actually, you know what?
None of you did. Not one.

44:25.600 --> 44:28.171
You keep playing tennis
with someone worse than you...

44:28.240 --> 44:31.050
and you ain't never gonna get better,
so thank you.

44:31.120 --> 44:34.203
- You play tennis?
- It's a metaphor, you potato with eyes.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.525
You know what?

44:37.600 --> 44:40.683
Pardon my French, but you can eat my shit.

44:40.760 --> 44:42.762
Whore! Whore! Whore!

44:45.960 --> 44:47.883
Man, that was awkward.

44:50.600 --> 44:52.329
- Angie?
- Yeah.

44:52.400 --> 44:54.402
Go get me some punch.

44:56.480 --> 44:58.005
All right.

45:17.480 --> 45:19.767
Great party.

45:19.840 --> 45:23.367
Listen. We are so happy
that you and Daya...

45:23.440 --> 45:27.889
are having such fun, special,
secret times together.

45:27.960 --> 45:29.086
Oh, uh-

45:29.160 --> 45:31.242
And we really admire you
providing for her so well...

45:31.320 --> 45:33.243
you know, despite the circumstances.

45:33.320 --> 45:34.810
We just wanted to let you know...

45:34.880 --> 45:38.566
that we support you 500%
with our continued silence.

45:38.640 --> 45:42.087
Considering as such, in your next round
of leg-based contraband...

45:42.160 --> 45:45.403
we had a couple requests that could make
our aforementioned silence...

45:45.480 --> 45:47.005
a little bit more comfortable.

45:47.080 --> 45:50.687
I mean, I personally request
an iPod shuffle, you know...

45:50.760 --> 45:54.287
loaded with Alt and Post-punk,
Depeche Mode, Erasure.

45:54.360 --> 45:57.842
And I need Yoo-hoo
and ACT fluoride rinse for my teeth.

45:57.920 --> 46:00.969
A cell phone with a camera. Thank you.

46:01.040 --> 46:03.327
Happy Valentine's Day.

46:03.400 --> 46:05.323
- Thanks.
- Okay.

46:09.440 --> 46:13.729
That's a fucking low blow even for a filthy
sewer rat like you, Nichols. Really?

46:13.800 --> 46:15.882
You told people I have crabs.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.446
You just found out about that?

46:18.520 --> 46:20.488
- It is cheating.
- Come on.

46:20.560 --> 46:23.040
A-Rod doesn't cry
when he gets plunked in Beantown.

46:23.120 --> 46:25.043
He sucks it up and tries to steal second.

46:25.120 --> 46:27.282
I've been trying
to both suck and steal second...

46:27.360 --> 46:29.249
but I can't because everybody
thinks I have cooties.

46:30.760 --> 46:33.161
Speaking of a set, how many you got?

46:33.240 --> 46:37.962
Thirty-six, after I gave Pirkle the double
shocker in the showers just now.

46:38.040 --> 46:39.644
Really? You Pirkled?

46:39.720 --> 46:41.961
Oh, I Pirkled. And then I Pirkled again.

46:42.040 --> 46:43.485
And?

46:43.560 --> 46:46.609
It was gnarly. It's macro-clit.

46:46.680 --> 46:48.125
It was like blowing a toddler.

46:48.240 --> 46:50.322
- Oh, my God.
- It was so uncomfortable.

46:50.400 --> 46:52.209
That's fucking hilarious.

46:52.280 --> 46:55.329
Oh, God. So, 36?

46:55.400 --> 46:57.129
We're tied.

46:57.200 --> 46:59.202
- Yep.
- Yeah.

46:59.280 --> 47:01.726
- Have you considered maybe we just stop?
- Do you wanna maybe just stop?

47:01.800 --> 47:03.370
- I don't have to.
- If you want to.

47:03.440 --> 47:07.411
I'm okay with it. 'Cause we both fucked-

47:07.480 --> 47:08.970
Lots.

47:09.040 --> 47:11.441
Remind me why we did this
to ourselves in the first place.

47:11.520 --> 47:13.727
Because I am insanely competitive.

47:13.800 --> 47:16.883
Yeah, and I need to feed
my addictive tendencies at all times.

47:19.440 --> 47:21.090
Cookie-eating contest.

47:21.160 --> 47:24.323
Son, have you ever actually seen me?

47:24.400 --> 47:26.289
You are going down!

47:40.040 --> 47:42.725
Thanks, guys. That was for Cora.

47:42.800 --> 47:44.689
We're gonna miss your laugh, Corn-Dog.

47:44.760 --> 47:46.808
And we're gonna take five.

47:50.240 --> 47:52.049
Hey!

47:52.120 --> 47:54.487
You made it. We're just going on break.

47:54.600 --> 47:57.570
Wow. You look so different.

47:57.640 --> 48:00.962
Well, you know,
I like to keep things profesh at work.

48:02.120 --> 48:04.168
I saved you a stool with a view.

48:04.240 --> 48:06.049
Oh. Actually, we're gonna need a table.

48:06.120 --> 48:07.690
I didn't know you were coming.

48:07.760 --> 48:09.649
You heard me say it sounded fun.

48:09.720 --> 48:12.041
I hope you don't mind.
I told some of the guys about your show.

48:12.120 --> 48:13.849
I almost didn't make it. Get this.

48:13.920 --> 48:17.003
The sellers are now refusing
to drop the replacement contingency.

48:17.120 --> 48:18.804
Would you shut up about real estate?

48:18.880 --> 48:21.360
I asked you to move in with me
and you said no...

48:21.440 --> 48:23.647
so you have no talking rights here.

48:23.720 --> 48:27.202
This is nice. Like a double date.

48:27.280 --> 48:28.725
- We're not together.
- We're not together.

48:28.840 --> 48:30.888
Actually, we're gonna need another chair.

48:30.960 --> 48:32.485
Why?

48:37.760 --> 48:39.888
You look like the gay Edge.

48:44.320 --> 48:45.321
Hey.

48:59.520 --> 49:02.126
It's like you become more you...

49:02.200 --> 49:05.443
which... normally is like-

49:07.200 --> 49:10.124
But... now it's okay...

49:10.200 --> 49:13.761
because the person, like...

49:15.720 --> 49:17.927
whoever...

49:18.000 --> 49:21.402
they chose to take all that on.

49:21.520 --> 49:23.204
All that weird stuff.

49:23.280 --> 49:28.446
<i>Whatever's wrong or bad
or hiding in you...</i>

49:28.520 --> 49:30.568
suddenly, it's all right.

49:32.160 --> 49:35.243
You don't feel like such a freak anymore.

49:37.720 --> 49:39.245
Larry.

49:40.720 --> 49:42.722
Would the moon do this?

49:46.960 --> 49:50.043
I won!

49:53.320 --> 49:55.721
Larry. Good to see you, mate.

49:55.800 --> 49:58.565
Ooh! Sorry about the stink.
I killed a caribou.

49:58.680 --> 50:00.808
Less gamy marinated in pineapple juice.

50:00.880 --> 50:02.928
Also makes your spunk taste good.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.207
So you're in luck, babe. Mwah.

50:05.280 --> 50:06.850
What's that?

50:06.920 --> 50:08.843
Oh. It's, uh-

50:08.920 --> 50:10.490
It's Piper's stuff.

50:10.560 --> 50:12.164
Oh, brother. Come on.

50:12.240 --> 50:15.164
We were just heading out for some ramen.
We have a babysitter.

50:15.280 --> 50:16.805
I'll leave these with the doorman.

50:16.880 --> 50:19.770
- Pete, really, I should-
- It's Valentine's Day, asshole.

50:19.840 --> 50:21.444
Come join us.

50:31.880 --> 50:33.609
Ooh! Ha!

50:42.480 --> 50:44.323
Um-

50:44.400 --> 50:47.051
I... found this in your trash.

50:47.120 --> 50:49.088
What is this?

50:52.840 --> 50:55.810
This is the guy
you're always talking about?

50:57.360 --> 50:59.010
Mmm.

50:59.080 --> 51:01.731
I know something about lovin' people...

51:01.800 --> 51:04.451
who aren't smart enough
to wanna be loved back.

51:04.520 --> 51:07.569
But I learned a secret
that I can tell you.

51:07.640 --> 51:09.802
They don't deserve it.

51:14.320 --> 51:17.449
He's ruined this day for me forever.

51:17.520 --> 51:20.091
Nobody knows that we're not together.

51:20.160 --> 51:22.970
Yeah. But you do.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.446
I do. I do know.

51:39.120 --> 51:41.043
You know what is crazy?

51:41.160 --> 51:44.687
I still wanna believe
in all of this stuff...

51:44.760 --> 51:47.923
even after everything that's happened.

51:49.560 --> 51:51.722
Isn't that sad?

51:51.800 --> 51:53.609
Oh, no.

51:53.680 --> 51:56.047
I think that's brave.

51:57.360 --> 51:59.249
Thank you.

52:12.920 --> 52:14.809
Seriously.

52:14.880 --> 52:18.521
Do you think
I should get fake tits?

52:20.640 --> 52:23.689
Yeah. Probably.

52:31.680 --> 52:33.921
Asshole.

52:36.120 --> 52:38.566
You know what gets me?

52:38.640 --> 52:43.441
We're wasting the best years
of our lives in here.

52:43.520 --> 52:46.683
Like, our tits are
never gonna look better.

52:46.760 --> 52:50.401
Our asses are never gonna look better.

52:50.520 --> 52:52.887
You know, no one's touching my ass.

52:52.960 --> 52:55.088
No one's kissing my lips.

52:56.360 --> 52:57.850
Shit.

52:58.840 --> 53:00.842
I'll kiss your dumb lips.

53:07.760 --> 53:09.285
Do it again.

53:30.640 --> 53:33.723
No. No.

53:35.240 --> 53:36.765
Come here.

54:00.840 --> 54:04.242
Yo, P., come and show these fools how
to cabbage patch for real.

54:04.320 --> 54:05.560
Nah, I'm good.

54:05.640 --> 54:08.007
- Man, don't act like everything fine.
- Yo!

54:08.080 --> 54:11.448
I don't interrupt you when you going to
town on a bunch of spaghetti. Damn.

54:11.560 --> 54:15.326
Yo, why don't you head on back
to old Erykah Badu over there?

54:16.960 --> 54:18.689
I'm gonna forget you said that.

54:18.760 --> 54:21.843
I don't give a fuck
what you forget or remember.

54:22.960 --> 54:25.850
Aw, shit. Great. Thanks a lot, man.

54:32.840 --> 54:34.365
Poussey.

54:36.640 --> 54:38.847
Hey!

54:39.680 --> 54:41.170
Hey!

54:41.240 --> 54:43.049
- Well?
- We're not leaving.

54:43.120 --> 54:45.282
- Talk to the Americans.
- Fuck you.

54:45.360 --> 54:48.921
Fuck you, man. This is your doing. You.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.844
Been drinking, little girl?

54:51.920 --> 54:54.685
You don't get to decide
what happens to my life.

54:54.760 --> 54:56.683
Not you.

54:56.760 --> 54:58.728
I love her.

55:01.880 --> 55:04.611
And that is why you're going home.

55:07.880 --> 55:10.531
I'm done. I'm not going anywhere.

55:16.280 --> 55:18.442
Pardon us, <i>Oberstleutnant.</i>

55:20.200 --> 55:22.089
Enjoy your ice cream.

55:22.160 --> 55:23.844
You know, there are programs...

55:23.920 --> 55:28.562
that can change your daughter's...
confused predilections.

55:29.760 --> 55:31.250
Thanks.

55:32.160 --> 55:33.685
But she's fine.

55:57.880 --> 55:59.530
Fun party.

55:59.600 --> 56:02.922
A party with no men,
booze, real food or drugs.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.890
Good thing we're too old for any trouble.

56:07.040 --> 56:08.690
Right.

56:08.800 --> 56:10.450
How's the gardening going?

56:14.360 --> 56:18.445
Once the thaw comes,
we'll really get going.

56:18.560 --> 56:21.131
Now, I'd ask you to join, but...

56:22.120 --> 56:24.885
you clearly have your own hobbies.

56:24.960 --> 56:27.770
We gotta have people.

56:27.840 --> 56:31.128
You know this will not end well.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.002
What about you, Chapman?

58:09.440 --> 58:12.364
It's like coming home after a long trip.

58:17.680 --> 58:19.682
That's what love is like.

58:22.680 --> 58:24.409
It's like coming home.

58:28.200 --> 58:29.770
Thanks for asking.

59:42.200 --> 59:50.200
