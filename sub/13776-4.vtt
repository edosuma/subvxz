Open up, Spazz.
We know you're in there.

00:20.518 --> 00:22.518
<i>Spazz no está</i>
<i>aquí,</i> man.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.520
Where's the stuff, Spazz?
Uh, I honestly don't know,

00:24.522 --> 00:26.589
guys.
Actually, right now it's kind of

00:26.591 --> 00:28.758
a bad time.
I'm having a gastrointestinal

00:28.760 --> 00:32.194
kind of thing.
Hey, guys. What's up?

00:32.195 --> 00:34.196
I love what you've done to
the place.

00:34.198 --> 00:36.198
Look at this.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.200
Oh, look at you.
Want to break it?

00:38.202 --> 00:40.336
If you guys need anything to
drink or anything, there's a

00:40.338 --> 00:42.538
beer on the bed or some pizza in
the bathroom, too.

00:42.540 --> 00:44.540
Did you just offer us shit
pizza?

00:44.542 --> 00:46.542
It's got cheese in the crust.
Well, you know what the good

00:46.544 --> 00:48.711
news is?
The boss wants to see you...

00:48.713 --> 00:51.280
Oh, good.
Let's go see him, then.

00:51.282 --> 00:53.616
You didn't let me finish.
The boss wants to see you...

00:53.618 --> 00:55.585
dead.

01:04.087 --> 01:05.194
- What's up?!
- Ow!

01:05.196 --> 01:07.029
Cheers.
No, that's my beer.

01:07.031 --> 01:08.864
We could share this beer,

01:08.866 --> 01:10.866
'cause we're best friends.
No. I don't think so.

01:10.868 --> 01:12.868
Yeah, that's a good idea.
I've got a whole lip thing going

01:12.870 --> 01:14.503
on.
I'm having the best time with

01:14.505 --> 01:16.505
you bros.
Hey, guy, are you gonna answer

01:16.507 --> 01:18.140
- that?
- Rafi, I think it's your

01:18.142 --> 01:20.042
phone.
Maybe it's one of my hot

01:20.044 --> 01:22.044
dogs, I don't know.
Whoa!

01:22.046 --> 01:24.046
Answer it.
What? Oh, yeah. Hello.

01:24.048 --> 01:26.048
Yes, it is.
Leonard Spazzinelli?

01:26.050 --> 01:28.250
Yeah, I know him.
He's, like, my best friend.

01:28.252 --> 01:31.520
Don't get mad.
 Wait.

01:31.522 --> 01:34.991
Dead? Wh-What do you mean?
Oh, my God!

01:34.993 --> 01:37.660
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:37.662 --> 01:40.029
Brian, Spazz is dead!
I don't know who that is.

01:40.031 --> 01:46.202
Oh, no, no! No! No!
My God...!

01:46.204 --> 01:51.941
Randy! Randy!
Aah! Randy...!

01:51.943 --> 01:56.579
Hey. Come here.

01:56.581 --> 01:59.248
Find Randy. Find Randy!
Rafi, hey.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.250
What's happened?

02:01.252 --> 02:03.452
What's happened?
Spazz is dead!

02:03.454 --> 02:07.423
It's the worst day of my life.
I got the news just today.

02:07.425 --> 02:12.194
They shot him, Randy!
They shot him right in the head!

02:12.196 --> 02:14.764
They shot Spazz!
I'm never gonna forget the

02:14.766 --> 02:17.900
last thing I said to him, man.
I said, "Spazz, you <i>can</i> put the

02:17.902 --> 02:20.102
whole thing in your mouth."
Yeah?

02:20.104 --> 02:22.705
And he said...

02:22.707 --> 02:25.741
I remember, man, I was there,
pushing his head down on it and

02:25.743 --> 02:27.743
shoving it in.
Are you thinking what I'm

02:27.745 --> 02:29.745
thinking?
That I really have to take a

02:29.747 --> 02:31.747
shit after eating three hot dogs
on the way over here?

02:31.749 --> 02:33.916
No. We are gonna murder the
people that murdered our friend

02:33.918 --> 02:35.551
Spazz!
Yes!

02:35.553 --> 02:39.088
Guess what.
What?

02:39.090 --> 02:42.324
Dirty Randy and Rafi are
going to Los Angeles.

02:42.326 --> 02:46.462
Vigilante justice!
Oh! Look at this mess!

02:46.464 --> 02:48.464
Who's this tall drink of water?

02:48.466 --> 02:50.466
This is disgusting.
Please pick this up.

02:50.468 --> 02:52.468
Margaret, I quit this
bullshit job.

02:52.470 --> 02:54.970
You can't quit... you were
fired four months ago.

02:54.972 --> 02:56.739
I quit <i>now!</i>
<i>You go get me my severance</i>

02:56.741 --> 02:58.674
<i>package!</i>
<i>You don't have a severance</i>

02:58.676 --> 03:00.776
<i>- package.</i>
<i>- You</i> don't

03:00.778 --> 03:03.312
have a severance package!
I have a very good severance

03:03.314 --> 03:04.947
package.
Then get me <i>your</i> severance

03:04.949 --> 03:06.949
package!
What's a severance package?!

03:06.951 --> 03:09.151
I'm going to call the
security guard and he'll get

03:09.153 --> 03:11.153
rid of you.
Oh, guess what.

03:11.155 --> 03:14.156
In this bullshit library, I own
security!

03:14.158 --> 03:16.192
I don't own security;
we should probably go.

03:16.194 --> 03:18.027
That guy hates me.
Oh, okay, let's go.

03:18.029 --> 03:20.029
We could get in trouble.
Let's do this for Spazz!

03:20.031 --> 03:21.664
Right, let's do this for Spazz!

03:21.666 --> 03:24.533
We're gonna go to L.A.!
Let's go to L.A.! Yeah!

03:24.535 --> 03:26.368
Where's your car?
Where's <i>your</i> car?

03:26.370 --> 03:28.370
Where's the porn-mobile?
I lost my car in a drag race

03:28.372 --> 03:31.107
with Korean teenagers.
Why are you drag-racing

03:31.109 --> 03:32.708
Korean teenagers?
It's the only way I can get a

03:32.710 --> 03:34.710
boner anymore.
Your fetishes are getting,

03:34.712 --> 03:36.712
like, really specific.
Are you finding the same

03:36.714 --> 03:38.347
thing?
It used to be that I just

03:38.349 --> 03:40.549
wanted to get a blow job from a
woman with <i>no</i> teeth, but now I

03:40.551 --> 03:42.952
only want to have sex with a
woman with <i>one</i> tooth.

03:42.954 --> 03:45.221
I like having sex with a
woman and ejaculating the moment

03:45.223 --> 03:47.223
she has her first menopausal hot
flash.

03:47.225 --> 03:49.325
Dude!
Yes! I call it man-opause.

03:49.327 --> 03:51.393
That's what she'll think of it
as. Dude, that's good.

03:51.395 --> 03:53.028
Dude, it is so good seeing
you, man.

03:53.030 --> 03:55.030
Good seeing <i>you,</i> bro.
I'll talk to you later, man.

03:55.032 --> 03:57.199
You're the best.
<i>You're</i> the best.

03:57.201 --> 03:59.301
Wait a minute! Spazz!
We got to go to L.A.!

03:59.303 --> 04:01.237
How are we gonna get there?

04:01.239 --> 04:03.739
I got a new set of wheels.
Trust me, he's my best

04:03.741 --> 04:05.908
friend... he's totally gonna let
us borrow his car.

04:05.910 --> 04:08.344
I really think my car will
make it to L.A., man.

04:08.346 --> 04:11.080
Uh, R-Randy, this-this is a
BMX bike.

04:11.082 --> 04:13.182
Huge day at work today, and I
don't know why I told Ruxin I'd

04:13.184 --> 04:14.817
pick him up and drive him to the
airport.

04:14.819 --> 04:16.418
No. You are going to
be great.

04:16.420 --> 04:19.454
Okay. I love you.
Bye.

04:19.457 --> 04:26.462
What the shit?
Where's my car?

04:26.464 --> 04:34.069
Oh, goddamn Rafi!*

04:34.071 --> 04:43.445
Whoo!
Whoo...!

04:45.283 --> 04:47.116
Whoa! Shit!
Where are we? Where...

04:47.118 --> 04:49.251
I don't know, we're driving.
We're good, we're good,

04:49.253 --> 04:50.886
we're good.
Hey, Randy, what's gonna

04:50.888 --> 04:52.888
happen in L.A.?
I think big things are gonna

04:52.890 --> 04:54.890
happen, is what I think.
You do?

04:54.892 --> 04:57.459
I do.
Oh, look at this beautiful

04:57.461 --> 05:00.095
country.
Oh, we should go left.

05:00.097 --> 05:05.968
Go left, go left, go left.*

05:05.970 --> 05:08.437
I love seeing all the dead
animals at the side of the road.

05:08.439 --> 05:11.207
It really turns me on.

05:11.209 --> 05:13.976
Man! This baby's got the best
butt plug I've ever worn.

05:13.978 --> 05:16.745
You want it?
Yeah.

05:16.747 --> 05:20.082
I thought when I fell off, I
would get a lot more hurt.

05:20.084 --> 05:21.984
Oh!
Oh, it's so nice of your

05:21.986 --> 05:24.453
friend's stupid kid to leave us
his baby drug mirror.

05:24.455 --> 05:26.455
Oh, yeah. Oh!
I gave him this.

05:26.457 --> 05:28.657
So he could do drugs with it.
Instead, he just looks at his

05:28.659 --> 05:31.493
dum-dum face with it.*

05:31.495 --> 05:33.896
I'm so glad we can share this
moment together.

05:33.898 --> 05:37.299
Me, too. It's just you and
me... and Brian! What's up?

05:37.301 --> 05:39.301
Hey!
Here we are at the Grand

05:39.303 --> 05:40.936
Canyon...
Wow.

05:40.938 --> 05:42.938
...jerking off.
Just another of our "Coming on

05:42.940 --> 05:44.940
America" series.
Oh, my God.

05:44.942 --> 05:46.475
This is Grand Canyon.
Tomorrow...

05:46.477 --> 05:49.245
Oh, no, oh, God, shut it off!
Oh, my God, oh, God!

05:51.549 --> 05:59.188
Rafi.
Wake up. Wake up, man!

05:59.190 --> 06:01.190
What? What?
We're in L.A.

06:01.192 --> 06:04.260
Oh, my God! Amazing!
I know!

06:04.262 --> 06:06.462
I had the craziest dream.
We were driving on the wrong

06:06.464 --> 06:08.464
side of the highway and caused a
huge pile-up.

06:08.466 --> 06:10.099
Oh, that actually happened.
What?!

06:10.101 --> 06:12.101
I didn't wake you.
You just looked like an angel.

06:12.103 --> 06:13.543
We just kept driving.
That's amazing.

06:13.663 --> 06:16.272
L.A., baby! Ooh-ooh...!

06:19.124 --> 06:20.793
Looks like this is where
Spazz was killed.

06:21.033 --> 06:22.665
This is nice.
Super nice.

06:22.667 --> 06:24.667
I mean, whoa.
All right, I'm gonna go talk

06:24.669 --> 06:26.669
to the manager, see what he
knows... you take care of the

06:26.671 --> 06:28.159
car.
Done.

06:30.494 --> 06:33.276
Hey. You had a murder here in
your motel a couple of days ago.

06:33.278 --> 06:35.345
I'm here to ask you a few
questions, get to the bottom of

06:35.347 --> 06:36.946
it.
Are you the police?

06:36.948 --> 06:38.948
Are <i>you</i> the police?
No.

06:38.950 --> 06:42.719
Then yes, I <i>am</i> the police.
My name is Sergeant Lieutenant

06:42.721 --> 06:46.222
Randolph.
Dirty Randolph.

06:46.224 --> 06:48.558
So, what do you know, man?
I don't know anything.

06:48.560 --> 06:52.395
I told you everything.
You are a tough nut to crack,

06:52.397 --> 06:55.698
but I'm gonna bust your nut.
Didn't want it to come to this,

06:55.700 --> 06:58.935
but looks like I'll have to use
the powers of seduction.

06:58.937 --> 07:00.470
Please don't.
Just tell me what I need to

07:00.472 --> 07:02.472
know... maybe I can throw a
little something your way.

07:02.474 --> 07:04.140
Look, my friend, you are not
my type.

07:04.142 --> 07:06.242
I'm not your type?!
I'm everyone's type.

07:06.244 --> 07:08.411
My junk is like O positive
blood... it's universally

07:08.413 --> 07:10.814
compatible.
Look, man, I'd hate to see

07:10.816 --> 07:13.083
something bad happen to this
place.

07:13.085 --> 07:15.552
No, wait. Hey, hey!
That paper's expensive!

07:15.554 --> 07:17.554
Come back here! That's matte
finish.

07:17.556 --> 07:19.389
Take it easy, all right?
Okay, you gonna talk?

07:19.391 --> 07:21.224
You got cameras in this little
shit hole.

07:21.226 --> 07:23.226
I want the shower cams, I want
the toilet cams.

07:23.228 --> 07:25.128
And not just the ones looking at
the toilet... I want the ones in

07:25.130 --> 07:26.963
the toilet.
I want to see what the poop

07:26.965 --> 07:28.965
sees.
No, you're not getting the

07:28.967 --> 07:30.800
poop cam.
Give me my poop cams!

07:30.802 --> 07:36.673
No! Not getting my poop cams!
Whoa! Whoa! Rafi!

07:36.675 --> 07:38.508
What?
What are you doing, man?!

07:38.510 --> 07:40.343
What, you said take care of
the car.

07:40.345 --> 07:42.345
So you lit it on fire?
That's what "take care of it"

07:42.347 --> 07:44.180
means!
When I asked you to take care

07:44.182 --> 07:46.282
of my mother's cat, is this what
you did?

07:46.284 --> 07:48.651
Of course!
This is a "my bad" kind of

07:48.653 --> 07:50.653
scenario.
Totally.

07:50.655 --> 07:52.689
I had no idea you couldn't
light a car on fire in Los

07:52.691 --> 07:54.524
Angeles.
Now we know.

07:54.526 --> 07:56.593
You can't burn a car anywhere
actually.

07:56.595 --> 07:58.328
Oh, you can.
I've burned, like, 40 cars...

07:58.330 --> 08:00.163
never been arrested.
You should... you should g...

08:00.165 --> 08:01.798
It's a great way to get rid
of evidence.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.800
Yeah.
Probably shouldn't tell me

08:03.802 --> 08:05.435
that.
We're on the same team here.

08:05.437 --> 08:07.437
We-We're detectives.
For now. When we solve our

08:07.439 --> 08:09.439
friend's murder, we will become
vigilantes.

08:09.441 --> 08:11.508
Yes.
That's illegal. You can't be

08:11.510 --> 08:13.610
a vigilante.
Why? Batman does it.

08:13.612 --> 08:15.612
There's no such thing as
Batman, and being a vigilante...

08:15.614 --> 08:18.515
What? You are so wrong!
If you go to Gotham right now,

08:18.517 --> 08:20.517
Batman is taking the law into
his own hands.

08:20.519 --> 08:22.318
Batman is a fictitious
character...

08:22.320 --> 08:24.154
Batman is the alter ego of
Bruce Wayne, who's...

08:24.156 --> 08:26.156
Who's real, obviously.
In the movie, he's a real...

08:26.158 --> 08:27.891
In the documentaries.
I'm sorry?

08:27.893 --> 08:29.726
There's, like, a million
documentaries about Batman.

08:29.728 --> 08:31.895
There's one from the '70s,
then there's some from the '90s,

08:31.897 --> 08:33.563
then they just had three in the
last, like, decade.

08:33.565 --> 08:35.565
There's, like, three new
documentaries about Batman!

08:35.567 --> 08:37.500
Do you have any idea what the
term "documentary" means?

08:37.501 --> 08:39.335
Yeah, non-porno movies.
With real people in them.

08:39.337 --> 08:41.337
<i>English Patient.</i>
<i>You guys belong in a mental</i>

08:41.339 --> 08:42.972
<i>institution.</i>
<i>That's how we met, actually.</i>

08:42.974 --> 08:45.074
<i>It was lovely.</i>
<i>Look, you guys just-just get</i>

08:45.076 --> 08:47.010
<i>out of here, okay? Just get out.</i>
<i>Whoa. Wait, what?</i>

08:47.012 --> 08:48.645
<i>Just get out of Los Angeles,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

08:48.647 --> 08:50.647
<i>Just get out?</i>
<i>Just get out of here?</i>

08:50.649 --> 08:52.248
<i>Just get out.</i>
<i>When I saw you were bald, I</i>

08:52.250 --> 08:53.883
<i>thought I shouldn't be</i>
<i>presumptuous...</i>

08:53.885 --> 08:55.885
<i>I can't believe it took us</i>
<i>this long, man.</i>

08:55.887 --> 08:57.587
<i>You're a Nazi.</i>
<i>You're a Nazi, man.</i>

08:57.589 --> 08:59.489
<i>Excuse me?</i>
<i>You just gave us a full-on</i>

08:59.491 --> 09:01.491
<i>Nazi salute.</i>
<i>No, no, no. No, no, I was</i>

09:01.493 --> 09:03.092
<i>not.</i>
<i>No, I was saying, "Get out."</i>

09:03.094 --> 09:04.727
<i>What do you think the motion</i>
<i>is?</i>

09:04.729 --> 09:06.729
<i>That's what Hitler was saying.</i>
<i>Is that what he was saying?</i>

09:06.731 --> 09:08.565
<i>He was saying, "Jews, get out</i>
<i>of Germany."</i>

09:08.567 --> 09:10.667
<i>No, that's a Sieg Heil.</i>
<i>He was going, "Heil"</i> and he

09:10.669 --> 09:12.669
went low-l, too.
No, it's not like "high up

09:12.671 --> 09:15.338
high" and lo... No, it's-it's...
Look, I'm not even sure of the

09:15.340 --> 09:17.840
origins of-of <i>Sieg He...</i>
<i>You seem like you are.</i>

09:17.842 --> 09:20.043
<i>No, I don't seem like I am.</i>
<i>I was saying good-bye.</i>

09:20.045 --> 09:22.045
<i>You've done it, like, 100</i>
<i>times, man.</i>

09:22.047 --> 09:24.280
<i>I'm trying to show you!</i>
<i>I'm showing you!</i>

09:24.282 --> 09:26.616
<i>I'm showing here!</i>
<i>This country is very open to</i>

09:26.618 --> 09:28.618
<i>Nazis.</i>
<i>Okay, you know what, here are</i>

09:28.620 --> 09:30.620
<i>your friend's belongings.</i>
<i>Take them, get out of here.</i>

09:30.622 --> 09:33.523
<i>Ooh, Spazz's stuff.</i>
<i>Whew, let's see what we got.</i>

09:33.525 --> 09:35.692
<i>Don't dump it out on my...</i>
<i>We're just gonna use this...</i>

09:35.694 --> 09:37.527
<i>Why did Spazz have a tape</i>
<i>dispenser?</i>

09:37.529 --> 09:39.596
<i>That's not... That's my tape.</i>
<i>Are these Spazz's?</i>

09:39.598 --> 09:41.631
<i>Those are my paper clips.</i>
<i>Wait, there's a clue in here.</i>

09:41.633 --> 09:45.068
<i>"Booty Barn, Oxnard Road, Van</i>
<i>Nuys."</i>

09:45.070 --> 09:46.903
<i>Nice.</i>
<i>How do we get there?</i>

09:46.905 --> 09:49.872
<i>Looks like Spazz left us the</i>
<i>keys to the Spazz Mobile.</i>

09:49.874 --> 09:53.076
<i>Awesome! Tell you what, man,</i>
<i>you hear about a murder at the</i>

09:53.078 --> 09:55.411
<i>Booty Barn tonight, you know who</i>
<i>did it.</i>

09:55.413 --> 09:59.882
<i>Rafi and Dirty Randy.</i>
<i>You can go eat your own dick.</i>

09:59.884 --> 10:07.824
<i>*</i><i>Whew. Oh, ho, ho, ho.</i>

10:07.826 --> 10:10.226
<i>This place is nice.</i>
<i>Right? I'm glad you wore your</i>

10:10.228 --> 10:14.964
<i>nice flip-flops.</i>
<i>Stay frosty, man.</i>

10:14.966 --> 10:17.133
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>One of these sickos could've</i>

10:17.135 --> 10:19.469
<i>killed our friend Spazz.</i>
<i>We owe it to Spazz to stay</i>

10:19.471 --> 10:25.908
<i>here and investigate every clue</i>
<i>we can as deep as possible.</i>

10:25.910 --> 10:27.910
<i>Or at least as far as they'll</i>
<i>let us go.</i>

10:27.912 --> 10:29.746
<i>I want to investigate that</i>
<i>clue.</i>

10:29.748 --> 10:31.748
<i>There's a black clue back</i>
<i>there that I'm really curious</i>

10:31.750 --> 10:33.616
<i>about.</i>
<i>I heard there's a clue in the</i>

10:33.618 --> 10:36.619
<i>back that has coke.</i>
<i>I've got a lot of pent up</i>

10:36.621 --> 10:38.621
<i>investigating to do.</i>
<i>Oh, me, too! I got blue</i>

10:38.623 --> 10:40.957
<i>clues!</i>
<i>Yeah, I'd like to investigate</i>

10:40.959 --> 10:45.194
<i>all over some of these clues!</i>
<i>Let's do it, man.</i>

10:45.196 --> 10:47.764
<i>Two Jagerbombs.</i>
<i>One Cobb salad.</i>

10:47.766 --> 10:52.135
<i>Hold the onions.</i>

10:52.137 --> 10:54.470
<i>Dirty Randy's gonna make it</i>
<i>rain!</i>

10:54.472 --> 10:56.472
<i>Yeah!</i>

10:56.474 --> 10:58.708
<i>Dirty Randy should not be making</i>
<i>it rain!</i>

10:58.710 --> 11:00.710
<i>What are you doing? No, no, no.</i>
<i>I'm jizzing money!</i>

11:00.712 --> 11:02.545
<i>What? No.</i>
<i>It's a money shot!</i>

11:02.547 --> 11:04.380
<i>No, no, no, no!</i>
<i>Yeah!</i>

11:04.382 --> 11:06.382
<i>No, Randy, no. No, no.</i>
<i>No, Randy...</i>

11:06.384 --> 11:08.217
<i>Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.</i>

11:08.219 --> 11:10.219
<i>Let me go. Let me go.</i>
<i>Yeah, go, go. Get in there.</i>

11:10.221 --> 11:12.055
<i>Get in there.</i>

11:12.057 --> 11:14.891
<i>Yeah!</i>
<i>Yeah, get it! Yeah.</i>

11:14.893 --> 11:17.527
<i>Oh. Oh, man.</i>
<i>I can't believe they have a</i>

11:17.529 --> 11:19.529
<i>pinball machine here.</i>
<i>I know. How cool is this,</i>

11:19.531 --> 11:21.364
<i>right?</i>
<i>This is awesome!</i>

11:21.366 --> 11:23.700
<i>They're kind of just asking</i>
<i>for an Accused</i> typesituation,

11:23.702 --> 11:25.702
though, you know?
What's that?

11:25.704 --> 11:28.037
<i>The Accused?</i> The movie?
I've never heard of that.

11:28.039 --> 11:30.373
What?! Oh, my God, dude, it's
only, like, the greatest

11:30.375 --> 11:33.042
romantic comedy ever made.
I love romantic comedies!

11:33.044 --> 11:35.244
It's like <i>Sleepless in</i>
<i>Seattle</i> meets <i>The Proposal</i>

11:35.246 --> 11:37.413
<i>meets nonconsensual sex.</i>
<i>Who's in it?</i>

11:37.415 --> 11:39.415
<i>Oh, my God, that dude.</i>
<i>Um, Jodie Foster.</i>

11:39.417 --> 11:41.884
<i>He's my favorite actor!</i>
<i>He's so good in it, too.</i>

11:41.886 --> 11:44.220
<i>He's such a good actor.</i>
<i>He was great in Nell.</i>

11:44.222 --> 11:49.692
<i>Hey, it's starting to smell</i>

11:49.694 --> 11:52.195
<i>in here.</i>
<i>I think we should have</i>

11:52.197 --> 11:54.931
<i>housekeeping come in and clean</i>
<i>Spazz's brains off the ground.</i>

11:54.933 --> 11:57.767
<i>No way, man. I like it.</i>
<i>It's like having a little piece</i>

11:57.769 --> 12:00.269
<i>of Spazz with us.</i>
<i>Aw. So sentimental.</i>

12:00.271 --> 12:03.039
<i>Whoa!</i>

12:03.041 --> 12:05.041
<i>Rafi?</i>
<i>Dirty Randy?!</i>

<i>Cock brothers.</i>
<i>Joel and Ethan Cock!</i>

12:07.412 --> 12:09.245
<i>What is going on?</i>
<i>Look at you. Look at you.</i>

12:09.247 --> 12:11.247
<i>We haven't seen you guys</i>
<i>since we were chased out of</i>

12:11.249 --> 12:13.082
<i>Chicago.</i>
<i>Oh, man.</i>

12:13.084 --> 12:15.084
<i>What are you guys doing here</i>
<i>in Spazz's room?</i>

12:15.086 --> 12:16.919
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>We're shooting a porn, yeah.</i>

12:16.921 --> 12:18.921
<i>He always let us shoot porns in</i>
<i>his room.</i>

12:18.923 --> 12:20.757
<i>That's amazing.</i>
<i>He was so generous.</i>

12:20.759 --> 12:22.692
<i>What are you guys doing here?</i>
<i>We've been staying in his</i>

12:22.694 --> 12:24.727

<i>here with us.</i>
<i>Sure, yeah.</i>

12:26.564 --> 12:28.398
<i>You know what I like to think?</i>

12:28.400 --> 12:30.767
<i>That that part of him is the</i>
<i>part that remembers me.</i>

12:30.769 --> 12:32.602
<i>Yeah, this bloodstain is</i>
<i>awesome.</i>

12:32.604 --> 12:34.604
<i>We just had him bang her on it a</i>
<i>little while ago.</i>

12:34.606 --> 12:36.439
<i>Great idea.</i>
<i>It's really quite beautiful,</i>

12:36.441 --> 12:38.441
<i>like, as a tribute to him.</i>
<i>Kind of a posthumous</i>

12:38.443 --> 12:41.477
<i>three-way for Spazz.</i>
<i>Nice. I say we power through</i>

12:41.479 --> 12:43.579
<i>till dawn and then drinks</i>

12:43.581 --> 12:45.581
<i>I don't want to rush you</i>

<i>And three more balls.</i>

<i>I don't want to brag, but at</i>
<i>this particular moment, we're</i>

12:57.267 --> 13:00.235
<i>doing everything right.</i>
<i>This is the life, boys.</i>

13:00.237 --> 13:03.571
<i>Rolling 18 inches deep.</i>
<i>Couple of beers, good</i>

13:03.573 --> 13:05.907
<i>friends, bunch of bath salts.</i>
<i>Look, we can't forget what</i>

13:05.909 --> 13:07.909
<i>brought us here.</i>
<i>Do you guys know who killed</i>

13:07.911 --> 13:10.111
<i>Spazz?</i>
<i>Chuck Falcon.</i>

13:10.113 --> 13:13.048
<i>What?! The amazing</i>
<i>pornographer Chuck Falcon?</i>

13:13.050 --> 13:15.050
<i>The Falcon himself.</i>
<i>Chuck Falcon is, like, the</i>

13:15.052 --> 13:17.419
<i>Steve Jobs of pornography.</i>
<i>And like Steve Jobs, he also</i>

13:17.421 --> 13:19.854
<i>murders people.</i>
<i>You thinking what I'm</i>

13:19.856 --> 13:21.689
<i>thinking?</i>
<i>Pasta night?</i>

13:21.691 --> 13:25.527
<i>No. That we are gonna have to</i>
<i>go to... the Falcon's nest.</i>

13:25.529 --> 13:27.529
<i>That was great, actually.</i>
<i>Well, it's not gonna be that</i>

13:27.531 --> 13:29.531
<i>easy.</i>
<i>I mean, Falcon takes security</i>

13:29.533 --> 13:31.533
<i>really seriously.</i>
<i>And this weekend is his</i>

13:31.535 --> 13:35.570
<i>daughter's 11th birthday party.</i>
<i>Well, we are gonna easily</i>

13:35.572 --> 13:40.575
<i>make our way in there when we go</i>
<i>to... the Falcon's nest.</i>

13:40.577 --> 13:42.577
<i>I've been telling you, I</i>
<i>don't know 'cause...</i>

13:42.579 --> 13:44.979
<i>Shut... Dude, don't talk</i>
<i>after I say "Falcon's nest,"</i>

13:44.981 --> 13:46.881
<i>okay?</i>
<i>I want "Falcon's nest" to be the</i>

13:46.883 --> 13:48.716
<i>last thing anyone says.</i>
<i>For the rest of the day?</i>

13:48.718 --> 13:50.752
<i>Here.</i>
<i>So we're not supposed to talk</i>

13:50.754 --> 13:54.823
<i>after you say it?</i>
<i>No. Falcon's nest.</i>

13:54.825 --> 13:56.958
<i>How long does this last for?</i>
<i>Oh, my...</i>

13:56.960 --> 13:59.282
<i>Longer than that.</i>
<i>That wasn't long enough!</i>

13:59.402 --> 14:00.895
<i>I'm trying to have a moment!</i>

14:02.568 --> 14:04.107
The only way we're gonna get
into Falcon's place at this

14:04.347 --> 14:06.563
point is in disguise.
I've got an idea.

14:06.683 --> 14:08.583
What?
We've got a bunch of porn

14:08.585 --> 14:10.752
wardrobe in our office.
Yeah.

14:10.754 --> 14:12.820
Where's your office?
Parked right over there.

14:12.822 --> 14:15.089
What? Whoa.
God, that's a nice office.

14:15.091 --> 14:16.925
All right, what do you
think... <i>Pretty Woman</i> dress-up

14:16.927 --> 14:19.227
montage?
Uh, let's just skip to what

14:19.229 --> 14:22.864
we're gonna ultimately wear.
What do we got?

14:22.866 --> 14:24.699
That's perfect.

14:24.701 --> 14:26.501
My, oh, my, look at this.
Is this what normal people

14:26.503 --> 14:28.336
wear?
Who knows?

14:28.338 --> 14:30.171
But it looks good.
Really?

14:30.173 --> 14:32.240
I mean, where's the butthole?
How do people poop in these?

14:32.242 --> 14:34.042
They don't take their pants
off, do they?

14:34.044 --> 14:37.045
Oh, sure.
You pull 'em down, poop, and

14:37.047 --> 14:39.247
then, once you're done, you pull
'em back up and fasten it.

14:39.249 --> 14:41.015
You have just complicated the
whole ordeal.

14:41.017 --> 14:42.884
So, wait, but then the pants
are just in, like, the dirt.

14:42.886 --> 14:44.852
Only if you're pooping in dirt.

14:44.854 --> 14:46.521
Where else would we poop?
We're not animals.

14:46.523 --> 14:49.057
Yeah.
What porno is this even from?

14:49.059 --> 14:51.292

<i>Whoa, gay dads... that's a</i>

<i>Yep.</i>

<i>Now we just need an 11-year-</i>

<i>The only people you can blow</i>
<i>at this party are other 11-year-</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>You got your gun?</i>

15:49.252 --> 15:50.918
<i>Yes, I've got my gun.</i>
<i>Do you have your gun?</i>

15:50.920 --> 15:53.087
<i>Of course I do.</i>
<i>Let's find this piece of shit</i>

15:53.089 --> 15:56.758

<i>Just walking over here.</i>

<i>'Cause we're bringing Candy to</i>

<i>Exactly.</i>
<i>Yeah, marriage is the weirdest.</i>

16:18.348 --> 16:20.314
<i>It's so tough.</i>
<i>Now that we're married, we</i>

16:22.052 --> 16:23.718
<i>Sometimes we just start</i>

16:23.720 --> 16:25.820
<i>I'm like, "Punch me in the face</i>

<i>death.</i>

16:59.856 --> 17:01.689
<i>Spazz.</i>
<i>Spazz, who you know.</i>

17:01.691 --> 17:03.591
<i>You killed.</i>
<i>And in doing so it will mean</i>

17:03.593 --> 17:05.693
<i>that your life will come to an</i>
<i>end.</i>

17:05.694 --> 17:09.196

17:22.011 --> 17:24.244
<i>to make amateur porn look really</i>
<i>amateur.</i>

17:24.247 --> 17:26.414

<i>Yeah, I mean, I mean, that's</i>

17:26.415 --> 17:28.348

<i>Yeah, I make all the sex</i>

17:28.351 --> 17:30.618
<i>sounds with my mouth afterwards.</i>

17:30.620 --> 17:32.587
<i>Squish.</i>
<i>The stuff you shoot makes</i>

17:32.589 --> 17:34.355
<i>people say, "I feel slightly</i>
<i>dumber for having masturbated to</i>

17:34.357 --> 17:36.557
<i>that."</i>
<i>Oh, my God, do you mind if we</i>

17:36.559 --> 17:38.593

<i>You killed our friend, man.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:51.741 --> 17:53.574
<i>He was stealing from us.</i>
<i>Aw.</i>

17:53.576 --> 17:55.710
<i>What?</i>
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

17:55.712 --> 17:57.578
<i>I mean, I don't know...</i>
<i>Spazz was kind of the worst.</i>

17:57.580 --> 17:59.247

17:59.249 --> 18:01.449
<i>I mean, that's Chuck Falcon.</i>
<i>It's Chuck Falcon offering us</i>

<i>Are you thinking what I'm</i>

18:03.319 --> 18:08.456

<i>I kind of think I am.</i>

18:08.458 --> 18:13.227
<i>Where do I sign?</i>
<i>What, why?!</i>

18:13.229 --> 18:15.096
<i>What, what?</i>
<i>We were gonna sign an</i>

18:15.098 --> 18:17.064
<i>exclusive contract!</i>
<i>No, no.</i>

18:17.066 --> 18:20.434
<i>You can't shoot him!</i>
<i>We have not been on the same</i>

18:20.436 --> 18:22.904

Yes, sir, Master Prince of

18:34.250 --> 18:36.117
Porn.
Yes, good.

18:36.119 --> 18:37.852
You killed the guy.
You didn't pay him, right?

18:37.854 --> 18:39.854
Myself.
Good.

18:39.856 --> 18:41.522
Don't look at me.
Feed me.

18:41.524 --> 18:44.458
All right, ooh.
There you go, Rafi.

18:44.460 --> 18:46.460
Candy, no!

18:46.462 --> 18:48.129
What are you doing?! No!
Jesus, guys.

18:48.131 --> 18:49.864
Get away from the drugs!
Guys, on a positive note, I

18:49.866 --> 18:51.532
feel like we probably got
everything we need from this

18:51.534 --> 18:53.367
angle.
We can move on.

18:53.369 --> 18:55.269
I don't like it anymore. Cut.
No, action.

18:55.271 --> 18:57.104
No, cut!
Action!

Yes action!

19:02.946 --> 19:04.779
No, no!
Action!

19:04.781 --> 19:06.447
I said, "Action!"
I said, "Cut!"

19:06.449 --> 19:08.282
Should we cut?
Yes!

19:08.284 --> 19:10.551
No!

19:10.553 --> 19:13.621
I'm carrying you like a baby.
I have strapped you to my

19:13.623 --> 19:18.392
back in a papoose like I'm an
Indian woman on the plains

19:18.394 --> 19:21.896
fleeing for my life against the
British invaders!

19:21.898 --> 19:24.832
This ends today!
Oh, it's got to end!

19:24.834 --> 19:26.734
You thinking what I'm thinking?

19:26.736 --> 19:28.736
Duel.
Whoa.

19:28.738 --> 19:30.671
That was... we're... that...
we're really on the same page

19:30.673 --> 19:32.340
right now.
Same page.

19:32.342 --> 19:34.542
Here are the rules of the duel.

19:34.544 --> 19:38.179
Ten paces, then start shooting.
You ready?

19:38.181 --> 19:40.181
Ready.
Go.

19:40.183 --> 19:46.254
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

19:46.256 --> 19:51.826
ten.

19:55.164 --> 20:01.936
Oh, no.

20:01.938 --> 20:06.515
High five?
God.

20:06.635 --> 20:11.071
Yeah!
Yeah, let's do it again!

20:11.073 --> 20:14.207
No, he's dead.
Oh.

20:14.209 --> 20:17.844
Oh, Rafi.
None of you saw shit!

20:17.846 --> 20:20.146
He killed himself!
He shot himself while you

20:20.148 --> 20:21.915
were shooting at him?
Yeah, but that's our cover

20:21.917 --> 20:25.151
story!
Get up, you big idiot, get up.

20:30.268 --> 20:32.292
Brian, it's Rafi.

20:32.412 --> 20:33.682
If you're watching this,

20:34.674 --> 20:35.514
I'm dead.

20:35.634 --> 20:37.951
Come to Los Angeles and avenge my death.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.265
Brian, do not let me down in this,

20:40.385 --> 20:42.687
or I swear to God,
I will haunt you

20:42.807 --> 20:43.612
every night...
