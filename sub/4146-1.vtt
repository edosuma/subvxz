00:05.797 --> 00:07.381
<i>Hola, Daphanatics.</i>

00:07.382 --> 00:10.760
<i>We're back with another episode of</i>
Jeepers! It's Daphne!

00:10.761 --> 00:14.430
<i>Later in the show, you'll get a sneak</i>
<i>peak at my new modeling portfolio.</i>

00:14.431 --> 00:16.724
<i>A lot of you keep posting</i>
<i>videos or comments...</i>

00:16.725 --> 00:20.603
<i>asking me about my other career as a</i>
<i>mystery-solving teen monster-buster.</i>

00:20.604 --> 00:23.439
Like this video from
AlexSuperfan2112.

00:23.440 --> 00:27.610
<i>I heard that you're responsible for</i>
<i>breaking up the greatest band in history...</i>

00:27.611 --> 00:30.530
<i>the Alex Super Experience.</i>
<i>Is that true?</i>

00:30.531 --> 00:33.533
It sure is, AlexSuperfan2112.

00:33.534 --> 00:38.496
<i>It all started when the band accidentally</i>
<i>conjured up the ghost of Mamba Wamba...</i>

00:38.497 --> 00:41.457
<i>a creepy voodoo witch doctor.</i>

00:41.458 --> 00:43.376
Oh, look. We have a
live video chat.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.710
<i>- Hi, Daph.</i>
- Hi, Fred.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.084
<i>Great show. I just wanted</i>
<i>to point out that,</i>

00:47.110 --> 00:51.634
<i>as Velma has taught us again and again...</i>
there's no such thing as ghosts.

00:51.635 --> 00:56.013
Mamba Wamba here only pretended to
be an otherworldly witch doctor.

00:56.014 --> 00:59.267
<i>He was really a music producer</i>
<i>who got performer Lila...</i>

00:59.268 --> 01:03.688
<i>to pretend to be a zombie in order to</i>
<i>steal a potentially lucrative pop song.</i>

01:03.689 --> 01:06.742
Oh. Wait, what?

01:07.401 --> 01:10.194
<i>- Like, hey, Daph.</i>
- Shaggy. Scooby.

01:10.195 --> 01:14.407
But I think the musical case was the one
with the green phantoms, wasn't it?

01:14.408 --> 01:17.842
<i>Oh, yeah. They were</i>
<i>really Creeps and Crawls,</i>

01:17.868 --> 01:21.956
a pair of crooked, aptly named
lawyers. We were in a tight spot...

01:21.957 --> 01:26.460
but once again, Velma's brilliance solved
a musical riddle and saved our lives.

01:26.461 --> 01:29.714
<i>Huh? I thought we were gonna</i>
<i>see your modeling pics.</i>

01:29.715 --> 01:31.841
- Oh, hi, Velma.
- Hi, Daphne.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.342
- Great show.
- Thanks.

01:33.343 --> 01:35.636
Hey, I was just singing
your brain's praises.

01:35.637 --> 01:38.848
I know, I was watching. But
that's just number crunching.

01:38.849 --> 01:44.186
It's your personal magnetism that allows us
to get close enough to bust these sociopaths.

01:44.187 --> 01:47.189
Like this one.
<i>Remember Old Iron Face?</i>

01:47.190 --> 01:51.569
<i>Oh, do I ever. He was actually</i>
<i>café owner Mama Mione...</i>

01:51.570 --> 01:54.697
<i>masquerading as the ghost of</i>
<i>a weird pirate or something...</i>

01:54.698 --> 01:57.199
<i>to help convicts</i>
<i>escape from prison.</i>

01:57.200 --> 02:00.077
Wait, no. Like, you're
thinking of Redbeard's Ghost.

02:00.078 --> 02:03.080
Man, ugh, that dude was creepy.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.124
Yeah, creepy.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.919
<i>That's right. At least, until we</i>
<i>found out he was C.L. Magnus...</i>

02:08.919 --> 02:12.381
a shipping magnate who was stealing from
himself and pocketing the insurance.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.100
Mm-hm, that's right.

02:14.101 --> 02:17.762
Hi, Daphanatic. What's your question?
Is it about my modeling pictures?

02:17.763 --> 02:21.641
What? Oh, no, I just searched "Velma
Dinkley," and this website came up.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.685
I have an urgent message for her.
My name is Cuthbert Crawley.

02:24.686 --> 02:29.273
- I'm a lawyer for her family.
- Lawyer? Family? Uh, ha, ha.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.609
Clearly this is some sort of scam.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.319
Scam? Velma.

02:33.320 --> 02:37.114
Oh, Daph. The Internet isn't exactly the
most reliable source of information.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.742
Nobody checks anything.
I mean, look at this.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.952
<i>A super suit? Please.</i>

02:41.953 --> 02:44.747
<i>And with tiny agents that</i>
<i>sit inside this thing?</i>

02:44.748 --> 02:45.956
Laughable.

02:45.957 --> 02:50.461
<i>Wait, you're saying that tiny</i>
<i>special agents aren't real? But...</i>

02:50.462 --> 02:53.381
Velma, you're ruining my show.

02:53.382 --> 02:57.343
Besides, the beauty of the Internet
is the freedom of information.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.387
And all the cool stuff
you can buy too.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.806
Velma, please. It's
a family emergency.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.308
You must come to my office
as soon as possible.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.185
I'm texting you my address.

03:06.186 --> 03:09.480
Whoops. Looks like we
lost him. Moving on.

03:09.481 --> 03:12.566
<i>He said it was an emergency.</i>
<i>We need to meet him right away.</i>

03:12.567 --> 03:16.417
<i>- We don't, Freddy. It's really okay.</i>
<i>- Come on, gang. Time's a-wasting.</i>

03:17.239 --> 03:20.032
Well, Daphanatics,
I guess that's all for now.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.159
Keep liking me. Please.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.009
<i>Ooh, wait. What about</i>
<i>the modeling pics?</i>

03:29.835 --> 03:33.379
Boy, it's great to have the
gang back together. Let's go.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.715
Fred, you really don't have
to go to the trouble...

03:35.716 --> 03:38.384
Nonsense. A road trip
is what we all need.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.761
Come on, gang. Let's go
see this lawyer Crawley.

03:40.762 --> 03:44.191
But, Fred, wait. Is the
Mystery Machine even ready?

03:44.975 --> 03:47.027
Is she ready?

03:53.984 --> 03:55.526
She's ready.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.069
Record time once again.

03:57.070 --> 04:02.467
Oh, careful, gang. I just had her
detailed and her flowers touched up.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.339
Daph, fingerprints.

04:04.536 --> 04:07.538
Let's keep her as shiny as we
can for as long as we can.

04:07.539 --> 04:10.583
I know it won't last
forever, but I have to try.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.334
I love you.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.171
Mm. You are such a beauty.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.849
Such a beauty. I love you.

04:18.007 --> 04:22.484
Velma, you are the sole beneficiary of your
great-great-uncle Baron Basil's estate.

04:22.721 --> 04:26.766
Like, Mr. Crawley, when you said
the candy was complimentary...

04:26.767 --> 04:28.517
do you mean it's, like, free?

04:28.518 --> 04:30.311
Uh, yes.

04:30.312 --> 04:33.105
As I was saying, due to an
unusual proviso in the will...

04:33.106 --> 04:35.941
you, Velma, as the youngest
member of the Dinkleys...

04:35.942 --> 04:39.496
inherit the entire property, including
the castle in Transylvania.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.833
- Aah! Transylvania?
- Transylvania?

04:48.371 --> 04:50.539
Uh, heh, I see. You needn't worry.

04:50.540 --> 04:54.877
This castle isn't in Eastern Europe.
It's in Transylvania, Pennsylvania.

04:54.878 --> 04:58.339
It's a rural village of ethnic
Transylvanians, who, like the Amish...

04:58.340 --> 05:01.894
choose to live in a more traditional
19th-century lifestyle.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.066
The 19th century?

05:07.891 --> 05:10.226
Well, you must be
thrilled about this.

05:10.227 --> 05:14.730
You'll be a woman of property and
inherit all of your family's fortune.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.650
I don't want anything to do with
my great-great-uncle Basil.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.902
They can give all of it
away, for all I care.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.987
- Give it away?
- Why wouldn't you want it?

05:21.988 --> 05:23.572
Perhaps that's just as well...

05:23.573 --> 05:27.743
considering all that talk about the
supernatural curse hanging over the estate.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.578
- Curse?
- Curse? Oh, ho-ho-ho.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.998
Yes. It's said that anyone who gets
too close to the baron's legacy...

05:32.999 --> 05:37.054
will lose what they love the most
and then be utterly destroyed.

05:37.462 --> 05:40.589
Don't worry, we'll stay away
from the baron's legacy...

05:40.590 --> 05:43.393
and his arm-acy and his foot-acy.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.262
Wait a minute, Velma.

05:46.263 --> 05:49.932
If you're related to a baron,
that makes you royalty.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.809
You could inherit a tiara.

05:51.810 --> 05:55.271
Why wouldn't you want your inheritance?
You don't believe in the curse, do you?

05:55.272 --> 05:58.468
Of course I don't believe in the curse.
You should know me better than that.

05:58.494 --> 06:01.778
Just leave it alone, Fred.

06:02.279 --> 06:03.487
Jeepers, Fred. What...?

06:03.488 --> 06:07.366
I know every sound the Mystery Machine
makes, and that is not one of them.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.840
Everybody, down.

06:11.000 --> 06:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:31.975 --> 06:36.030
<i>And if it wasn't for</i>
<i>you meddling kids...</i>

06:42.903 --> 06:46.155
<i>Clearly it was all just</i>
<i>an elaborate hoax.</i>

06:46.156 --> 06:49.005
<i>None of it seems to add up.</i>

06:49.659 --> 06:54.510
<i>If it wasn't for you snooping around,</i>
<i>I would have gotten away with it.</i>

06:54.831 --> 06:57.850
<i>Another mystery solved.</i>

07:00.503 --> 07:03.898
<i>We don't need you kids interfering.</i>

07:05.592 --> 07:08.190
<i>Meddling around where</i>
<i>you're not supposed to.</i>

07:10.722 --> 07:13.557
<i>It was really just a disguise</i>
<i>to throw us off the...</i>

07:13.558 --> 07:16.236
<i>Fred, behind you.</i>

07:31.201 --> 07:34.004
<i>Scooby-Dooby-Doo.</i>

07:36.706 --> 07:41.102
You'll have all the time you need to
think about that, at the state prison.

07:56.101 --> 08:00.656
<i>I have a hunch that this whole</i>
<i>mystery is about to be solved.</i>

08:11.825 --> 08:15.953
<i>I guess you'll be going</i>
<i>away for a very long time.</i>

08:15.954 --> 08:20.725
<i>And that explains why those</i>
<i>spooky creeps were able to fly.</i>

08:43.940 --> 08:47.234
That guy's the worst parking-lot
attendant in history.

08:47.235 --> 08:50.487
That's no valet, Shaggy. That's
the Ghost of the Baron...

08:50.488 --> 08:53.574
Velma's old ancestor and the source
of the curse I mentioned earlier.

08:53.575 --> 08:56.493
Perhaps I should've been more
forthcoming about the details.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.387
Gee, you think?

09:05.712 --> 09:09.798
"Stay away from Transylvania."

09:09.799 --> 09:13.052
Don't worry, we wouldn't be
caught dead in that town.

09:14.304 --> 09:17.806
Sorry, Shaggy, but that is
exactly where we're going.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.142
Jeepers, Freddy, I don't know.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.574
We've faced a lot of
ghoulish creeps before,

09:22.600 --> 09:25.522
but this one just blew
up the Mystery Machine.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.441
And that's why we have to go, Daph.

09:27.442 --> 09:30.486
Together we've brought down more
than our share of villains...

09:30.487 --> 09:33.155
with nothing more than
pluck, jerry-rigged traps...

09:33.156 --> 09:34.865
and a box of Scooby Snacks...

09:34.866 --> 09:38.744
and for no better reason than a
love of justice and my van...

09:38.745 --> 09:41.872
and a knack for meddling
and a love for my van.

09:41.873 --> 09:45.834
- Did you just say "van"?
- No. No, I didn't say "van."

09:45.835 --> 09:50.089
But now we find the forces
of evil have come to us.

09:50.090 --> 09:53.675
Why? We don't know why.
Who? We can't say.

09:53.676 --> 09:56.428
But there is one thing
we can say for certain.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.848
- What?
- They killed my van.

10:01.810 --> 10:06.355
This time... This
time it's personal.

10:06.356 --> 10:10.536
But, like, without the Mystery
Machine, how would we even get there?

10:11.861 --> 10:13.862
The Transylvania Express.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.949
Who'd have thunk there'd be a night
train to a town I never heard of?

10:18.159 --> 10:20.702
- I love this train.
- Like, why?

10:20.703 --> 10:23.847
Two words: snack bar.

10:24.916 --> 10:28.085
Hoo-hoo-hoo. Yeah, at least
they do have a snack bar.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.420
And I don't mind if I do.

10:30.421 --> 10:34.216
Garçon, we'll take as many hamburger
platters that will fit on these trays.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.093
And don't be afraid of stacking.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.720
Sir, the Transylvanian
Express offers...

10:38.721 --> 10:42.599
only a tasty array of traditional
Carpathian delicacies.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.868
Carpa... Huh? Uh, what?

10:46.062 --> 10:47.705
Yuck!

10:52.402 --> 10:54.361
- What's this?
- What's what, Daph?

10:54.362 --> 10:56.409
It's that teen mystery
solver gossip site.

10:56.435 --> 11:00.284
I thought there might be something about my
modeling or whatever, but check this out.

11:00.285 --> 11:05.080
"What blue-spectacled teen super sleuth
is hiding a terrible family secret?

11:05.081 --> 11:07.875
Hint: She wears orange
knee socks every day."

11:07.876 --> 11:09.960
Velma, that's you.

11:09.961 --> 11:11.979
The truth is out on the Internet.

11:12.088 --> 11:15.465
Well, it looks like my
big secret is exposed.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.342
I never wanted you guys to know.

11:17.343 --> 11:21.096
Did you ever wonder why I'm so obsessed
with debunking the supernatural?

11:21.097 --> 11:23.891
We just always assumed it was
something you fell into.

11:23.892 --> 11:28.618
I was always curious about the
attachment to orange knee socks.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.275
Because you totally pull them off.

11:33.276 --> 11:34.953
Mm...

11:37.864 --> 11:39.615
It's time you knew the truth.

11:39.616 --> 11:45.120
My crusade of reason is the result
of my deep, shameful family secret.

11:45.121 --> 11:48.332
<i>Like many émigré families, our</i>
<i>original name was Americanized...</i>

11:48.333 --> 11:51.603
<i>when we disembarked at Ellis</i>
<i>Island from the old country.</i>

11:51.753 --> 11:55.672
America. We are free, ah, ha!

11:55.673 --> 11:58.522
You can't stop here. Move it along.

11:59.510 --> 12:02.279
- Name?
- Von Dinkenstein.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.809
Von Dinkenstein?

12:07.810 --> 12:13.023
Yes, I am the direct descendent of
the infamous Dr. Von Dinkenstein.

12:14.484 --> 12:18.834
<i>Back in the old country, legend had it</i>
<i>that he was the man who created a monster.</i>

12:31.584 --> 12:37.172
<i>It was this story that inspired Mary</i>
<i>Shelley to write her famous novel...</i>

12:37.173 --> 12:39.271
Frankenstein.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.856
<i>I don't believe that my</i>
<i>ancestor ever succeeded</i>

12:42.882 --> 12:45.514
<i>in actually creating the</i>
<i>monster, of course...</i>

12:45.515 --> 12:49.536
<i>but the fame created by Shelley's</i>
<i>story haunted my family.</i>

12:50.520 --> 12:53.563
It caused a kind of madness
in some of my relatives...

12:53.564 --> 12:56.692
who wished to achieve where
my ancestors had failed.

12:56.693 --> 13:00.195
Basil reclaimed the family
name, and its occupation.

13:02.031 --> 13:06.260
Guys. Did you even hear a
word of what I just said?

13:06.661 --> 13:10.497
Well, yeah. Your great-great-uncle
Baron Basil Von Dinkenstein...

13:10.498 --> 13:12.916
went crazy trying to
re-create the experiment.

13:12.917 --> 13:17.045
"Baron's monster runs amok.
Loss of income, blow to tourism."

13:17.046 --> 13:19.223
Oh, that's on the Internet?

13:21.050 --> 13:22.068
Well, never mind.

13:22.094 --> 13:26.138
Yes, this is why I'm obsessed with
solving supernatural phenomena...

13:26.139 --> 13:28.098
and exposing them as hoaxes.

13:28.099 --> 13:31.073
And we all thought you just
loved solving a good mystery.

13:34.397 --> 13:36.982
Like, man, did you feel that?

13:36.983 --> 13:40.569
Feels like the train just sped up
to like a gazillion miles per hour.

13:42.822 --> 13:46.042
If we hit that turn at this speed
we'll be hurled from the tracks

13:46.068 --> 13:48.076
and plunged into the abyss below.

13:48.077 --> 13:53.353
Like, oh, no. I wouldn't mind being plunged
into a vat of pudding or macaroni and cheese...

13:54.459 --> 13:55.667
but not the abyss.

13:55.668 --> 13:59.313
- Please, anything but the abyss.
- Yeah.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.854
We're not slowing down.

14:15.855 --> 14:20.285
I kind of wish I'd gone easy on
the goat's head and ketchup.

14:28.993 --> 14:32.496
Oh, no. We're going
to lose this car too.

14:32.497 --> 14:37.143
Come on, everyone, we've gotta save these
innocent people before they all die.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.632
- They might already be dead.
- Fred.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.356
All right. Everybody
move. Next car.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.150
Shaggy, try to reach the engineer.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.069
We've gotta slow down.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.963
We're on it.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.240
It's locked!

15:08.241 --> 15:11.326
- What?
- He said, it's locked.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.578
Try knocking it down!

15:13.579 --> 15:17.666
- Try what?
- He said, try knocking it down.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.836
What? Are you nuts?

15:20.837 --> 15:24.641
- What?
- He said, are you nuts?

15:26.092 --> 15:27.609
Whoa!

15:34.100 --> 15:36.226
You should have
heeded my warning...

15:36.227 --> 15:40.248
for now you have incurred
the Von Dinkenstein curse.

15:40.314 --> 15:45.652
Each will lose what he loves most,
and then complete destruction.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.212
What was that?

16:08.718 --> 16:12.387
Tell the conductor to
slow the train down.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.725
- We're all gonna die.
- What?

16:16.726 --> 16:20.395
He said, we're all gonna die.

16:25.943 --> 16:30.113
<i>It's all right, it's okay</i>
<i>The Scooby gang will save the day</i>

16:30.114 --> 16:31.422
- Whoo! Yeah!
- Daphne...

16:31.448 --> 16:36.717
- this is hardly the time to cheerlead.
- Wait. It is. Daphne's onto something.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.416
It's working.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.002
Now pull us in. It's working.

16:46.005 --> 16:49.341
I always knew your cheerleading
would come in handy one day, Daph.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.064
Go, team! Whoa!

16:51.886 --> 16:54.679
We're not out of this
yet. Depot ahoy.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.903
No time to lose.

17:20.455 --> 17:22.874
No, no, no. No need to thank us.

17:22.875 --> 17:26.044
We were just doing our job. It's
more of a hobby, really, it's...

17:26.045 --> 17:28.296
What is the meaning of
destroying our train?

17:28.297 --> 17:31.550
Not to mention our town
clock. Well, I'm waiting.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.469
Well, heh, heh,
you see, the train...

17:34.470 --> 17:38.431
Actually, sir, we just did this town and
this train company a huge service...

17:38.432 --> 17:39.975
for saving so many lives.

17:39.976 --> 17:43.311
You. Girl Von Dinkenstein.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.647
I'd know those glasses anywhere.

17:45.648 --> 17:48.858
No Von Dinkenstein is
welcome in this town.

17:48.859 --> 17:53.164
It was your uncle's
monster did this to me.

17:55.616 --> 17:58.285
Why did the monster replace
your hand with a duster?

17:58.286 --> 18:01.746
The monster took my hand.
It was I who put the duster on.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.833
The police barracks aren't going
to clean themselves, you know.

18:04.834 --> 18:08.670
Plus, it traps and locks the dust on the
dirtiest things you could ever imagine.

18:08.671 --> 18:09.879
- Never lets go.
- Hee-hee.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.340
Never lets go.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.718
Like, I feel all sparkly. Huh.

18:14.719 --> 18:16.094
Sparkly clean.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.818
You can't blame Velma for
something her uncle did.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.348
Of course we can.

18:20.349 --> 18:23.518
We blame her entire bloodline
for the Von Dinkenstein curse.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.686
Yeah.

18:24.687 --> 18:27.188
- Seriously?
- Seriously, young lady.

18:27.189 --> 18:30.108
I'm Mr. Burger, the
burgermeister of this town.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.694
- You're a burger?
- Burger?

18:32.695 --> 18:34.029
One hundred percent.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.673
Oh-ho.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.503
I've never met a talking burger.

18:41.662 --> 18:44.122
Ugh. Needs ketchup.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.042
That's "burgermeister."
It means "mayor."

18:47.043 --> 18:49.628
Now, to answer your
question, young lady.

18:49.629 --> 18:53.882
Ever since the monster was destroyed,
the baron's ghost has haunted us.

18:53.883 --> 18:59.054
And now tourism is dead and our
famed factory barely stays open.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.722
What does this town make?

19:00.723 --> 19:03.975
We are the premiere torch
manufacturer in the northeast.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.894
Yeah, <i>vult</i> premiere.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.896
- You make torches?
- Yeah.

19:07.897 --> 19:10.231
Our burning pieces of
wood are second to none.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.125
Let me demonstrate.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.499
Flame on.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.212
Behold.

19:19.450 --> 19:22.077
- Guh!
- You...

19:22.078 --> 19:23.787
all of you...

19:23.788 --> 19:26.136
come with me.

19:26.248 --> 19:30.303
Um, guys, maybe we should
do what this little man says.

19:31.837 --> 19:36.591
It's hard to leave a giant burger behind,
but, ha, ha, like, where's your car?

19:47.728 --> 19:51.606
So, Mr. Guy-Who's-Driving-Us-Down-
a-Deserted-Road-to-No-One-Knows-Where...

19:51.607 --> 19:53.650
we didn't quite catch your name.

19:53.651 --> 19:54.984
Me, Iago.

19:54.985 --> 19:59.823
All generations Von Dinkensteins
have hunchback for servant.

19:59.824 --> 20:02.492
Bad posture bring good luck.

20:02.493 --> 20:04.619
Iago, you must know
the family history.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.455
Why does the Ghost of the
Baron wear that metal mask?

20:07.456 --> 20:14.087
Legend say on stormy November night,
baron work on his experiment.

20:14.088 --> 20:20.218
<i>He been collecting parts for project</i>
<i>many months from zoo cemetery...</i>

20:20.219 --> 20:22.442
<i>harbor...</i>

20:22.638 --> 20:26.057
<i>and less savory places.</i>

20:27.977 --> 20:32.480
<i>He find creatures,</i>
<i>mutants, cobbled together.</i>

20:32.481 --> 20:37.402
<i>Him poised to finally</i>
<i>give life to creation.</i>

20:42.616 --> 20:46.077
<i>But much to Baron Von</i>
<i>Dinkensteint chagrin...</i>

20:46.078 --> 20:50.554
<i>the villagers became apprised</i>
<i>of what he was about to do.</i>

20:51.417 --> 20:57.213
<i>They feared the worst, that such a</i>
<i>creature, assembled from parts discarded...</i>

20:57.214 --> 21:00.383
<i>would not know</i>
<i>compassion or empathy...</i>

21:00.384 --> 21:05.013
<i>and have only the capacity</i>
<i>for wanton destruction.</i>

21:05.014 --> 21:09.601
<i>The villagers put an end to both</i>
<i>the doctor and his abomination.</i>

21:09.602 --> 21:15.440
<i>So the monster was destroyed and the</i>
<i>barons face permanently disfigured.</i>

21:17.568 --> 21:20.028
<i>That is why he wore the metal mask.</i>

21:20.029 --> 21:22.447
But before he died years later...

21:22.448 --> 21:27.035
he vowed revenge and
cursed the entire town...

21:27.036 --> 21:31.182
for all eternity!

21:32.333 --> 21:35.001
Like, eternity, huh? Heh.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.628
That's a long time.

21:36.629 --> 21:39.881
Wait, a minute ago you spoke
in grunts and "ughs."

21:39.882 --> 21:42.050
When did you become so loquacious?

21:42.051 --> 21:48.108
Uh, Iago no understand
brainy-girl words. Muh.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.189
Whoa.

22:25.261 --> 22:27.178
Get a load of this grill, Scoob.

22:27.179 --> 22:30.699
I wish we had it on the train,
because that face could stop a...

22:34.478 --> 22:37.272
That's... That's a nice face.

22:37.273 --> 22:41.544
That's a very, very
nice "face" face.

22:46.240 --> 22:49.993
Good evening, and welcome
to Von Dinkenstein Castle.

22:49.994 --> 22:53.673
We are so glad to have you.

23:04.258 --> 23:08.188
That's quite a squeak. I've
got some DW-40 in the...

23:11.348 --> 23:14.743
Eh. Oh, never mind.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.163
For our safety.

23:19.315 --> 23:22.817
Like, what if we want to leave?

23:22.818 --> 23:26.748
Come and find me.
I have the only key.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.342
Now, Von Dinkenstein girl...

23:47.343 --> 23:49.761
Actually, it's "Dinkley."
And it's "Velma."

23:49.762 --> 23:52.680
And this is Daphne, Fred,
Shaggy and Scooby.

23:52.681 --> 23:57.352
I am Mrs. Vanders, the housekeeper
here at Castle Von Dinkenstein.

23:57.353 --> 24:00.873
I will show you to your rooms.

24:07.780 --> 24:13.007
Follow closely. The darkness
can be treacherous.

24:26.674 --> 24:29.523
These old floorboards
sure are squeaky.

24:43.148 --> 24:48.653
Dude, it seems like this place is
being held up with cobwebs. Heh.

24:48.654 --> 24:52.824
I hope that is not a comment
on my housekeeping skills.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.325
No.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.910
No, no, no.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.913
Like, we... We love cobwebs.
Don't we, Scoob?

24:58.914 --> 25:00.957
They're just, uh...
It's just a really...

25:00.958 --> 25:02.851
It's very European.

25:17.266 --> 25:19.767
Where's Inspector Krunch's
duster when you need it?

25:19.768 --> 25:23.646
- Ha, ha.
- You, Von Dinkenstein girl...

25:23.647 --> 25:27.042
did you say something you'd
like to share with the group?

25:27.234 --> 25:28.943
Nope. Nothing at all.

25:28.944 --> 25:32.498
And again, it's "Dinkley,"
not "Von Dinkenstein."

25:32.656 --> 25:34.082
Hmph.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.510
Hmph.

25:37.786 --> 25:41.511
With all these lights, your
gas bill must be enormous.

25:45.044 --> 25:48.296
<i>Nein</i>, the castle was built
on a natural-gas resource.

25:48.297 --> 25:50.548
We have all the gas we need.

25:50.549 --> 25:54.052
- Ha, ha. Yes, you do. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.845
Did you say something?

25:55.846 --> 25:57.739
- Uh, nope.
- Nope.

26:08.484 --> 26:10.036
Huh?

26:16.492 --> 26:18.034
- Aah!
- Yikes!

26:18.035 --> 26:20.745
Like, something invisible
is playing the organ.

26:20.746 --> 26:23.581
The only invisible things
I know of are ghosts.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.169
Only a trick of the wind.

26:28.170 --> 26:32.270
And it is my favorite song.

26:34.635 --> 26:38.530
This can be your room,
Von Dinkenstein girl.

26:44.228 --> 26:47.748
It's "Dinkley," and I don't
think this will work.

26:48.315 --> 26:52.527
Whoops. That one is certain death.
These doors all look alike.

26:52.528 --> 26:56.614
Perhaps you wish another room?
The ones across the hall are available.

26:57.825 --> 27:00.701
We do have bats that tend to
screech around the clock.

27:00.702 --> 27:02.537
I'm sure that would
be irritating...

27:02.538 --> 27:06.124
if it wasn't being drowned out by
Shaggy and Scooby's chattering teeth.

27:08.544 --> 27:12.421
Otherwise, I'm sure you
will be comfortable.

27:12.422 --> 27:16.101
Now, let me show you to the
crown jewel of the castle.

27:21.431 --> 27:24.154
The laboratory.

27:25.644 --> 27:29.772
My great-great-uncle certainly
didn't do anything halfway.

27:29.773 --> 27:32.066
Let's get a closer
look at this place.

27:32.067 --> 27:36.279
Uh, if we get close enough,
will it be behind us?

27:39.825 --> 27:42.093
Look at these notebooks.

27:48.917 --> 27:52.346
Actually, Scoob and I will
take a closer look...

27:53.297 --> 27:56.350
hee-hee, inside the
freezer for snacks.

28:01.597 --> 28:05.349
- Mm. This is more like it.
- Halt.

28:05.350 --> 28:09.604
Before you go any further,
I must inform you of two facts.

28:09.605 --> 28:12.829
One, these parts are not food.

28:14.151 --> 28:17.987
They are the parts the baron
rejected for his creature.

28:17.988 --> 28:20.823
Zoinks. Like, what's
the other fact?

28:20.824 --> 28:23.718
That at which you
sit is not a table.

28:28.540 --> 28:32.293
Like, a real-life
Frankenstein. Aah!

28:32.294 --> 28:35.963
Just to clarify, Frankenstein was
the doctor, not the monster.

28:35.964 --> 28:41.636
It's scarier than Frankenstein.
It's a regular Frankencreep.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.389
That's catchy.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.767
Sometimes I don't know
why I talk at all.

28:47.768 --> 28:50.811
It looks like a hodge-podge
of various monsters.

28:50.812 --> 28:54.982
Part scaly, part
furry, and all ugly.

28:54.983 --> 28:58.152
At least what we can see through
this hazy block of ice is.

28:58.153 --> 29:01.364
Now you can see why I keep
the castle temperature...

29:01.365 --> 29:02.990
somewhat low.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.326
It can't be real. It can't.

29:05.327 --> 29:07.078
It couldn't be true, could it?

29:07.079 --> 29:11.475
If the monster is real, then my entire
world view is called into question.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.003
This monster must be a fake.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.171
And I'll prove it.

29:17.172 --> 29:21.759
I'll re-create the baron's supposed
life-imbuing experiment from his own notes.

29:21.760 --> 29:25.596
When the ice is melted and the experiment
fails, the hoax will be revealed.

29:25.597 --> 29:29.433
My core hypothesis that monsters
are fake will be vindicated.

29:29.434 --> 29:31.435
I don't totally
understand your goal.

29:31.436 --> 29:36.065
But, Velma, you yourself told us how many
of your ancestors were driven crazy...

29:36.066 --> 29:38.025
by this monster obsession.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.568
I am not obsessed.

29:39.569 --> 29:41.696
I am the opposite of obsessed.

29:41.697 --> 29:43.990
I'll be proving
monsters don't exist.

29:43.991 --> 29:47.034
The opposite of what my
ancestors were attempting.

29:47.035 --> 29:50.871
- Do I need to define "opposite" for you?
- Well, I guess if you think it's safe.

29:50.872 --> 29:52.123
I know what I'm doing.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.347
Everyone out so I can get to work.

29:55.544 --> 29:57.795
Except you, Iago.
I'll need an assistant.

29:57.796 --> 30:01.020
Someone who can help me with
this antique science equipment.

30:01.341 --> 30:03.718
Wow, a Strickfaden electrowheel.

30:03.719 --> 30:07.569
I've kept these machines clean and
in good repair for decades. See?

30:08.724 --> 30:12.727
Notice how the gyroscope
spins, spinning slowly.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.478
Look closely.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.747
Very closely.

30:26.241 --> 30:29.535
Listen to that growling.
It sounds sinister.

30:29.536 --> 30:32.079
It is. It's mine and
Scooby's stomachs.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.540
We haven't eaten in
like 20 minutes.

30:34.541 --> 30:38.419
And, like, the constant state of
sheer terror makes you hungry.

30:38.420 --> 30:42.089
- Like, really hungry.
- Even I could go for a bite.

30:42.090 --> 30:45.331
- I anticipate your every need.
- Aah!

30:45.357 --> 30:48.923
Please try a traditional
dish of our homeland.

30:49.056 --> 30:51.932
Is it gluten-free? Does it
have hydrogenated oils?

30:51.933 --> 30:54.518
And it's not shellfish, right?
Because I'm allergic.

30:54.519 --> 30:57.993
Racituri is all-natural, organic...

30:58.607 --> 31:00.659
jellied pigs feet.

31:02.944 --> 31:06.405
It's a little chewy for me.
But thank you anyway.

31:06.406 --> 31:12.286
You might find more fare to your liking at
the festival that's going on in the village.

31:12.287 --> 31:15.331
- There's a festival at night?
- Eh.

31:15.332 --> 31:18.501
Yeah, we might dig the
fare down at the fair.

31:18.502 --> 31:22.272
Come on, gang. I'll drive us down
to the village in the Myste...

31:26.343 --> 31:28.980
We could walk. It's better
for the environment.

31:29.006 --> 31:34.033
- We leave a smaller carbon footprint.
- Not with Scooby's paws, we won't.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.075
Oh.

31:49.533 --> 31:52.243
Welcome to the torch festival.

31:52.244 --> 31:55.079
Hmm. There don't seem to
be many out-of-towners...

31:55.080 --> 31:57.665
at your fair, Burgermeister Burger.

31:57.666 --> 32:02.086
That is because your friend's family's
madness has cursed this town, Fräulein.

32:02.087 --> 32:05.891
But please, make
yourselves welcome.

32:09.010 --> 32:11.153
Ah! Hey.

32:16.017 --> 32:18.269
Uh, what's a <i>gogosi</i> ?

32:18.270 --> 32:22.165
I may not speak Transylvanian, but
I know a doughnut when I see one.

32:22.190 --> 32:24.163
Like, count us in.

32:42.752 --> 32:44.295
He eats like one of us.

32:44.296 --> 32:47.019
Eat, dog boy. Eat like the wind.

32:54.431 --> 32:59.111
I'm gonna need some more chocolate
sauce and powdered sugar down here.

33:06.151 --> 33:09.153
Never has one man
swallowed so many <i>gogosi</i>.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.206
Even the ones with fish eggs.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.158
I ate fish eggs?

33:18.747 --> 33:20.623
This is adorable.

33:20.624 --> 33:22.249
Could I see this in a size two?

33:24.628 --> 33:26.921
Fräulein, at the very
least you're an <i>acht.</i>

33:26.922 --> 33:31.592
An <i>acht</i> ? Heh. An eight?
I don't think so.

33:31.593 --> 33:34.988
<i>Ja</i>, and here's the
only one in that size.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.807
Jeepers, it does fit.

33:38.808 --> 33:41.227
What? I'm an <i>acht?</i>

33:41.228 --> 33:43.187
And what's going on with my hair?

33:43.188 --> 33:46.690
This frizz. I use a sulfate-free
smoothing shampoo.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.334
What is happening?

33:53.949 --> 33:58.285
You have prevailed in scarfing
down, by the thousands...

33:58.286 --> 34:00.621
our culture's signature treat.

34:06.962 --> 34:11.465
To reward you, we present
you with our signature garb.

34:11.466 --> 34:14.134
Two sets of traditional lederhosen.

34:14.135 --> 34:17.972
The short leather pant is durable and
allows for freedom of movement...

34:17.973 --> 34:21.141
while the suspenders hold
them up for secure fit.

34:21.141 --> 34:23.686
And they have all the
traditional embellishments.

34:23.687 --> 34:27.815
A <i>latzbund, die messersack</i>,
and even a <i>schlitzfleck</i>.

34:30.025 --> 34:33.320
Like, man, these threads
are out of sight. Ha, ha.

34:33.321 --> 34:37.366
They sure do take the cake.
Or should I say "the <i>gogosi</i>"?

34:41.496 --> 34:43.746
"You've got a torch
in Transylvania."

34:43.748 --> 34:45.498
Ha-ha-ha. That's rich.

34:45.500 --> 34:50.681
This bumper sticker would be perfect
on the Mystery Machine's bumper, if...

34:55.342 --> 34:56.844
I guess not.

34:56.844 --> 34:59.819
Everything reminds me of her.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.683
She would've loved
this antenna ball.

35:12.152 --> 35:16.207
And here is the grand prize.

35:17.365 --> 35:20.534
Look, Scoob. It's you and
me made out of sausage.

35:20.535 --> 35:23.454
A delicious <i>blutenwursten...</i>

35:23.455 --> 35:28.709
a Transylvanian blood sausage, the
signature cured meat of our culture.

35:28.710 --> 35:30.961
It must be eaten immediately.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.172
Like, no problem there,
Mr. Burgermeister.

35:33.173 --> 35:35.976
We love anything made into sausage.

35:37.886 --> 35:41.861
- Ah.
- Okay, here we go. First big bite.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.236
- I'm not hungry.
- Me neither.

35:56.237 --> 35:59.740
- Hmm?
- I'm sorry, Mr. McBurgermeister.

35:59.741 --> 36:03.045
This, like, never happens, but
Scoob and I are totally full.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.290
We couldn't eat another bite.

36:08.291 --> 36:11.210
You reject the <i>blutenwursten?</i>

36:11.211 --> 36:13.545
Unbelievable.

36:15.632 --> 36:19.899
- That is the greatest insult.
- No, it's not an insult.

36:19.925 --> 36:23.608
It's a compliment. We can't eat
your signature cured meat...

36:23.634 --> 36:26.183
because we're so full of
your signature treat.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.907
Yeah, yeah. Complimented.

36:29.229 --> 36:32.314
It's the greatest insult, indeed.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.337
Like, gulp.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.698
- Unh. Fred.
- Oh, hey, Shaggy.

36:40.699 --> 36:43.951
- Is this the saddest day or what?
- We're in big trouble.

36:43.952 --> 36:48.348
We can't eat the <i>blutenwursten</i>
and now an angry mob is after us.

36:48.957 --> 36:53.335
Hey, don't worry. We'll just hightail
it back to the Mystery Machi...

36:53.336 --> 36:54.545
Drat.

36:54.546 --> 36:57.715
Oh, boy, he's still
thinking about the van.

36:57.716 --> 37:00.184
We need to find Daphne
and get out of here.

37:00.210 --> 37:01.301
Ouch.

37:01.302 --> 37:02.970
- Sorry, Scooby.
- Whoa.

37:02.971 --> 37:06.849
Zoinks. Daph, did you do
something with your hair?

37:06.850 --> 37:09.268
- Hmph.
- Daphne?

37:09.269 --> 37:11.562
Oh, Freddy, don't look at me.

37:15.150 --> 37:18.652
You've gotta hand it to them, this
town really makes great torches.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.796
They stay lit in the rain.

37:25.785 --> 37:27.327
Quickly, you come.

37:27.328 --> 37:30.164
Iago take you to castle now.

37:30.165 --> 37:31.832
Iago, you saved us.

37:31.833 --> 37:34.877
Not save you. You save her. Her.

37:34.878 --> 37:36.587
- Who?
- Your friend.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.589
Her mind gone.

37:38.590 --> 37:41.359
Velma now insane.

37:52.395 --> 37:56.450
Stand back, everyone. I'm gonna
break this door down. Unh!

37:56.566 --> 38:00.040
That door is solid oak, too
thick for even Shaggy's head.

38:00.195 --> 38:03.749
Velma. Velma. Please let us in.

38:10.914 --> 38:12.122
Welcome.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.721
- Aah!
- Your hair.

38:16.211 --> 38:19.379
I mean, it's not that bad.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.728
Come in, come in.

38:36.231 --> 38:39.066
You're just in time for
my greatest triumph.

38:39.067 --> 38:42.277
You mean you've debunked the legend
of the Von Dinkenstein monster?

38:42.278 --> 38:44.571
Wrong. Just the opposite.

38:44.572 --> 38:48.617
I am now convinced that the baron
was right. He was a genius.

38:48.618 --> 38:50.786
This monster can be
brought to life.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.957
It will live.

38:54.958 --> 38:59.419
But, like, Velma, your whole life is
about rejecting the supernatural...

38:59.420 --> 39:02.297
and magic and all that weirdness.

39:02.298 --> 39:04.007
This isn't weirdness.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.926
This is science.

39:11.683 --> 39:14.101
We saw the strange
lights in the castle.

39:14.102 --> 39:17.104
We know shenanigans are afoot.

39:17.105 --> 39:20.482
We demand to be let in.
Heh-heh-heh.

39:20.483 --> 39:23.861
No. I won't let you stand
in the way of science.

39:23.862 --> 39:26.196
We'll put a stop to you
and your creature.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.591
Let the ramming begin.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.849
Iago, quickly, the generator.

39:44.132 --> 39:46.105
Turn on the centrifuge.

39:52.515 --> 39:54.863
Now the humidifier.

39:57.979 --> 40:01.783
No! No more moisture!

40:02.400 --> 40:03.942
I can't take it.

40:06.529 --> 40:07.955
My hair!

40:09.657 --> 40:11.504
Raise the platform.

40:32.138 --> 40:33.690
Is everyone okay?

40:33.848 --> 40:35.557
Like, let me check.

40:35.558 --> 40:37.726
Fred, okay.

40:37.727 --> 40:40.200
Daphne, looking a little weird.

40:40.396 --> 40:43.700
Velma, ho-ho, totally nuts.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.067
Iago...

40:45.068 --> 40:48.570
Ooh. Iago stubbed toe.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.339
Iago, stubbed toe.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.542
Von Dinkenstein's monster...

40:54.035 --> 40:57.214
ah, a little bit of
freezer burn, I think.

41:10.343 --> 41:11.551
Alive.

41:11.552 --> 41:13.053
It's alive.

41:13.054 --> 41:15.948
Alive!

41:17.308 --> 41:20.828
It's alive. Really?

41:20.895 --> 41:25.166
Don't worry. I've got an iron-reinforced
net in the back of the Mystery Mach...

41:25.233 --> 41:28.568
- Dang it.
- You're really not moving on, are you?

41:28.569 --> 41:30.570
I feel oddly not afraid.

41:30.571 --> 41:33.073
Yeah, me too.

41:33.074 --> 41:35.200
Like, hi there, Mr. Frankencreep.

41:35.201 --> 41:37.035
You must be hungry.

41:37.036 --> 41:39.134
Have a Scooby Snack.

41:40.581 --> 41:42.666
It always makes us feel better.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.668
It sure does.

41:44.669 --> 41:47.546
No, thanks. I'm good.

41:53.761 --> 41:57.922
Phew, he really stinks, huh? Just as
well he can't see himself in a mirror,

41:57.948 --> 42:00.684
because he's pretty
hideous too. Heh.

42:12.155 --> 42:13.697
No, don't turn away.

42:13.698 --> 42:18.118
Look at yourself. You're beautiful.

42:36.637 --> 42:40.140
Lucky we brought our
torches. Let's get him.

42:56.491 --> 43:00.327
You fools. You've
ruined everything.

43:00.328 --> 43:01.754
Hmm?

43:02.163 --> 43:04.748
Jinkies, Daphne.
You look terrifying.

43:04.749 --> 43:06.301
Huh?

43:07.877 --> 43:10.087
I'm hideous.

43:10.088 --> 43:11.922
No, don't turn away.

43:11.923 --> 43:14.646
Look at yourself. You're beautiful.

43:14.675 --> 43:17.228
- Really?
- No.

43:19.514 --> 43:21.407
You are a monster, Velma.

43:21.557 --> 43:26.770
Heh. You've got to find my creation,
Fred. Find it before those fools do.

43:26.771 --> 43:31.289
I'm sorry, but without the Mystery
Machine, I'm no monster trapper.

43:31.315 --> 43:34.361
- I'm nothing.
- Jinkies.

43:34.362 --> 43:37.864
Don't worry, Velma. Scooby
and I will find him for you.

43:37.865 --> 43:43.412
You will? You're volunteering to go after
a monster? To go toward the danger?

43:43.913 --> 43:45.705
Yep.

43:45.706 --> 43:48.375
Great, I'll get the Scooby Snacks.

43:48.376 --> 43:52.146
- No, thanks. Not hungry.
- Huh?

43:58.970 --> 44:00.720
Without the Mystery Machine...

44:00.721 --> 44:03.265
I'm useless as a mystery-solver.

44:03.266 --> 44:05.392
And as a man.

44:05.393 --> 44:09.163
I'm just nothing
without my machine.

44:09.856 --> 44:12.899
Vroom. Vroom.

44:12.900 --> 44:15.202
Look at her go.

44:15.236 --> 44:16.695
Gone!

44:44.974 --> 44:48.560
I warned you and your
friends not to interfere.

44:48.561 --> 44:53.023
Now you have brought the
curse down upon your heads.

44:53.024 --> 44:58.956
Each of you will lose
what you hold most dear.

44:59.614 --> 45:01.823
Is that why I've lost my looks?

45:01.824 --> 45:04.923
Is this because I'm cursed?

45:11.626 --> 45:14.461
Jeepers, a secret tunnel.

45:14.462 --> 45:16.296
And it looks pretty creepy.

45:16.297 --> 45:20.147
But anything beats a thousand
mirrors on a bad hair day.

45:26.432 --> 45:32.103
Hey, Scoob, I don't know how to explain
it, but I'm feeling sort of, heh, brave.

45:32.104 --> 45:34.077
Yeah, me too.

45:34.106 --> 45:38.235
Like, even that shadow of the
Frankencreep doesn't scare me.

45:41.030 --> 45:43.365
Oh, right. Let's get him, Scoob.

45:50.917 --> 45:52.718
<i>Shake a leg and count to three</i>

45:52.719 --> 45:54.518
<i>This ain't no disparity</i>

45:54.519 --> 45:58.489
<i>Just a tip that it's worth knowing</i>

45:58.490 --> 46:00.191
<i>Don't just be terrified</i>

46:00.192 --> 46:02.126
<i>All you do is run and hide</i>

46:02.127 --> 46:05.529
<i>Best to get the party going</i>

46:05.730 --> 46:08.933
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

46:08.934 --> 46:13.170
<i>It's about...</i>

46:13.171 --> 46:16.473
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

46:16.474 --> 46:20.778
<i>Do the Transylvania polka</i>

46:31.389 --> 46:36.325
<i>Do the Transylvania polka</i>

46:36.836 --> 46:39.254
Velma, you got here fast.

46:39.255 --> 46:41.715
Yeah. And in this dress too.

46:41.716 --> 46:45.145
Well, it looks like our
work here is done.

46:45.428 --> 46:47.846
Not quite.

46:55.104 --> 46:57.873
Hey, where am I, anyway? Oof.

46:58.733 --> 47:01.252
Wow, look at all this stuff.

47:03.112 --> 47:07.133
These could come in handy.
So could this.

47:08.326 --> 47:10.549
And I know just how to use it.

47:20.588 --> 47:23.311
Who left all this old
mining equipment here?

47:24.675 --> 47:27.927
Wait a minute. This stuff
doesn't look old at all.

47:27.928 --> 47:33.058
Jeepers, there's something going on
here that doesn't quite meet the eye.

47:36.270 --> 47:40.148
So you've stumbled upon
my secret, have you?

47:40.149 --> 47:44.420
A pity you won't be able
to tell anyone about it.

47:47.406 --> 47:51.117
- Daphne. Sounds like it's coming from...
- Aah!

47:51.118 --> 47:53.136
here.

47:54.288 --> 47:56.581
Keep cool, Fred. Think.

47:56.582 --> 47:59.459
These old air vents connect
every room in the castle.

47:59.460 --> 48:02.754
But based on that echo
and air density...

48:02.755 --> 48:04.339
mm, and moisture...

48:04.340 --> 48:07.509
Daphne must be in some kind of
subterranean cave or tunnel.

48:07.510 --> 48:11.235
Hang on, Daph! I'm coming!

48:16.894 --> 48:18.446
Morning, Shaggy.

48:18.771 --> 48:22.148
Ah. Morning, Scoob. Oh.

48:22.149 --> 48:24.651
That's weird. I don't
remember going to bed.

48:31.909 --> 48:35.912
So, Velms, I stopped falling
out of bed like months ago.

48:35.913 --> 48:37.747
Why do you have us
strapped in here?

48:37.748 --> 48:41.084
Don't worry. I've deduced that
the monsters brain is defective.

48:41.085 --> 48:46.005
I just need to provide some additional
cerebral material to correct the problem.

48:46.006 --> 48:49.134
Oh, I see. Brains. Like,
that makes sense.

48:49.135 --> 48:51.719
- Wait.
- Where you gonna get brains?

48:54.515 --> 48:56.850
But, like, why do you
need both our brains?

48:56.851 --> 48:59.602
According to my calculations,
between the two of you...

48:59.603 --> 49:02.201
you almost have one entire brain.

49:08.863 --> 49:11.131
I must say, you're
taking this rather well.

49:13.701 --> 49:15.577
Well, Velma, you
know I always say...

49:15.578 --> 49:19.849
there's no point in getting all bent
out of shape over every little...

49:20.249 --> 49:24.169
Zoinks. Ha, ha. Like,
our new outfits.

49:24.170 --> 49:28.798
- Oh. Actually, I feel a little better.
- Me too.

49:28.799 --> 49:30.592
Those things were a tight fit.

49:30.593 --> 49:32.427
Shaggy, I'm hungry.

49:32.428 --> 49:36.890
Oh, boy. Like, all of a sudden I'm
pretty starving myself, buddy old pal.

49:36.891 --> 49:40.226
Iago, bring me the brain extractor.

49:40.227 --> 49:45.231
Yeah, Iago. Like, a good assistant would've
anticipated that she needed the brain...

49:47.026 --> 49:48.693
What am I saying?

50:01.916 --> 50:03.684
You are trapped, Fräulein.

50:03.918 --> 50:07.438
I don't think so, you grimy ghost.

50:19.141 --> 50:21.768
I told you, you would
never escape. Heh, heh.

50:21.769 --> 50:24.197
Hey, baron, guess again.

50:24.730 --> 50:27.783
I'm gonna clean your clock.

50:31.779 --> 50:33.296
Freddy, look out!

50:45.000 --> 50:47.961
You will lose this fight.

50:47.962 --> 50:51.983
Just as you lost your
precious Mystery Machine.

51:01.559 --> 51:03.142
Fred, get up.

51:03.143 --> 51:06.312
I... I'm sorry, Daphne, I...

51:06.313 --> 51:08.106
Don't do it for me, Fred.

51:08.107 --> 51:10.876
Do it for her.

51:41.015 --> 51:44.114
This isn't over.

51:46.103 --> 51:49.647
Wow, I didn't think I could do it
without the Mystery Machine...

51:49.648 --> 51:51.691
but I guess I could do it for her.

51:51.692 --> 51:55.778
Oh, Freddy, you're
my Mystery Machine.

51:55.779 --> 52:00.505
I'm just so sorry the curse has given
you such a damaged damsel to rescue.

52:00.784 --> 52:04.912
- You mean the Mystery Mach...?
- No, Fred. Me.

52:04.913 --> 52:07.261
I look so awful.

52:08.500 --> 52:11.210
You're kidding.
I didn't even notice.

52:11.211 --> 52:13.212
You always look great
to me, Daphne.

52:13.213 --> 52:16.049
Really? Aw.

52:16.050 --> 52:17.977
Sure.

52:22.473 --> 52:25.367
Freddy, look at the baron's cape.

52:26.060 --> 52:28.561
This fabric is a synthetic blend.

52:28.562 --> 52:30.205
I'd recognize it anywhere.

52:30.731 --> 52:33.033
- This should be real silk.
- Hmm.

52:33.525 --> 52:35.902
So maybe the baron
isn't a baron at all.

52:35.903 --> 52:37.945
Maybe he's not even a ghost.

52:40.741 --> 52:44.716
- Hold on.
- Aah!

52:58.592 --> 53:00.885
Please, Velma,
don't take our brains.

53:00.886 --> 53:03.304
We need what little we have.

53:03.305 --> 53:07.075
No, mistress. It wrong
to take brains.

53:07.685 --> 53:08.893
Ow!

53:08.894 --> 53:12.939
Get ready to make your contribution to the
greatest scientific accomplishment ever.

53:17.486 --> 53:19.278
Are you all right, Daph?

53:19.279 --> 53:25.131
Well, the good news is this dirndl doesn't
look any worse covered in two inches of dirt.

53:28.914 --> 53:32.291
And the bad news is
we're sealed in tight.

53:32.292 --> 53:34.836
Here, maybe if we...

53:34.837 --> 53:36.295
work together.

53:41.510 --> 53:45.906
Gosh, all this digging
is making me dizzy.

53:47.975 --> 53:51.119
Sealed in, airtight.

53:51.437 --> 53:53.104
Getting woozy.

53:53.105 --> 53:55.231
Gotta dig through the...

53:55.232 --> 53:57.483
Before we... Oh.

53:57.484 --> 53:59.536
Fred! Oh!

54:00.320 --> 54:03.197
Freddy? Oh, no.

54:06.910 --> 54:09.746
Okay, Scoob, what's the
number-one thing we're good at?

54:09.747 --> 54:13.082
Uh, running away? Hiding?

54:13.083 --> 54:17.138
Yes. But there's something else
that we're, like, really good at.

54:17.713 --> 54:20.983
- Eating.
- Yes. You know us too well.

54:25.179 --> 54:26.679
Tastes like chicken.

54:26.680 --> 54:27.930
No!

54:35.689 --> 54:37.106
Get them.

54:52.206 --> 54:55.931
Don't worry, Freddy.
I'm gonna get us out of here.

54:57.377 --> 55:02.507
Wow, jeepers, I'm
getting a little woozy.

55:03.717 --> 55:05.301
Ouch!

55:07.137 --> 55:09.263
Wait, not "ouch"?

55:09.264 --> 55:11.362
That didn't hurt at all.

55:12.059 --> 55:14.032
Jeepers, I'm bleeding...

55:14.144 --> 55:15.394
air.

55:15.395 --> 55:17.368
What? How...?

55:17.606 --> 55:21.035
This dirndl has an inflatable
suit built into it.

55:21.276 --> 55:24.455
Fred, I'm still the same Daphne.

55:25.239 --> 55:27.031
Oh, and also, we won't suffocate.

55:27.032 --> 55:29.585
We have fresh air.

55:39.545 --> 55:41.212
Perfect timing.

55:41.213 --> 55:44.090
My hideous dress
just ran out of air.

55:44.091 --> 55:48.761
Ugh. I've gotta get out
of this awful thing. Blech.

56:03.485 --> 56:06.445
- Library.
- Yeah, Scoob, it's the library.

56:06.446 --> 56:09.740
And since old Tall, Scaly and
Horrible doesn't have a brain...

56:09.741 --> 56:12.419
he probably doesn't have
a library card either.

56:13.579 --> 56:18.082
But just in case, we'd better find every
single secret entrance and barricade it.

56:18.083 --> 56:19.635
Yeah, yeah.

56:25.883 --> 56:27.633
Whew.

56:30.304 --> 56:31.846
Whew.

56:31.847 --> 56:34.400
We did it, Scoob. Ha, ha.

56:34.975 --> 56:38.950
Scooby, did we lock the door?

56:53.160 --> 56:55.077
Fred, Daphne.

56:55.078 --> 56:56.996
Shaggy. Oh.

56:56.997 --> 56:59.916
Like, are we ever glad
to see you guys. Ha, ha.

56:59.917 --> 57:03.169
- Let's get out of here.
- No. I'm tired of running.

57:03.170 --> 57:06.255
I say we face down our fiendish
foes once and for all.

57:06.256 --> 57:07.632
Right on.

57:07.633 --> 57:09.175
- Why?
- Wait.

57:09.176 --> 57:11.010
- The baron!
- The monster!

57:11.011 --> 57:12.637
Neither.

57:12.638 --> 57:14.597
Come with me if you wanna live.

57:16.558 --> 57:20.937
Velma, I can't let you get my brain. It
took me too long to get my hair just right.

57:20.938 --> 57:22.605
No time. Hurry.

57:22.606 --> 57:27.068
Gas is everywhere into the tunnels
and seeping up into the castle.

57:27.069 --> 57:29.445
We must flee the gas.

57:29.446 --> 57:32.907
Natural gas. That's why
I passed out so fast.

57:32.908 --> 57:36.452
- But wait, isn't natural gas...?
- Explosive.

57:36.453 --> 57:39.097
We've got to get out of
here right now, Freddy.

57:40.207 --> 57:41.791
I was working on something.

57:41.792 --> 57:43.876
It's a slim chance, but, uh...

57:49.883 --> 57:50.609
Huh?

57:50.635 --> 57:53.511
Fred, we'll, like, never
get a cab down here.

57:53.512 --> 57:58.683
Oh, Shaggy. Fred can't be
hailing a taxi. Use your brain.

57:58.684 --> 58:02.520
I am, I am. Totally still using it.

58:02.521 --> 58:05.481
I'm sorry I tried to
take your brains, guys.

58:05.482 --> 58:07.483
I think I was hypnotized
by a device...

58:07.484 --> 58:11.539
disguised to look like an antique
Strickfaden electrowheel.

58:13.031 --> 58:16.075
- Uh, that's okay.
- Yeah, Velma.

58:16.076 --> 58:18.619
Like, that could happen to anybody.

58:21.915 --> 58:24.388
Well, what do you know? It worked.

58:25.252 --> 58:30.900
Gang, presenting the
all-new Mystery Machine.

58:35.095 --> 58:37.193
Hyah! Hyah!

58:41.351 --> 58:42.852
And the amazing thing is...

58:42.853 --> 58:45.771
this gets better mileage than
the old Mystery Machine.

58:45.772 --> 58:48.691
Maybe you shouldn't mention
the Mystery Machine, Fred.

58:48.692 --> 58:53.839
That's okay, Velma. The Mystery
Machine is still alive in here.

58:58.035 --> 58:59.243
Hurry, Fred.

58:59.244 --> 59:02.705
If something were to ignite this
gas, this whole place will blow up.

59:02.706 --> 59:06.260
Yeah, but, like, what
could ignite it?

59:10.714 --> 59:12.687
Oh, no.

59:36.239 --> 59:41.660
That poor Von Dinkenstein girl
and all her friends, kaput.

59:41.661 --> 59:45.682
The Von Dinkenstein curse,
it is no more. Woo-hoe!

59:49.127 --> 59:51.837
Our plan, it worked. Success.

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:31.085
Hmm?

01:00:31.086 --> 01:00:32.920
Vroom. Vroom.

01:00:32.921 --> 01:00:35.256
Huh? What...?

01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:38.008
Vroom. Vroom.

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:40.302
No. The curse.

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:42.888
It can't really be true.

01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:47.744
No! Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:59.488
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

01:01:14.254 --> 01:01:17.089
No, <i>nein</i>, impossible.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:20.593
You, you leave me alone.

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:25.024
The curse, the curse. The
Dinkenstein curse. Ha-ha-ha!

01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:35.941
Ooh. Like, make us a snack.

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:37.985
Yeah, a snack.

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:47.786
- Shaggy, I'm hungry.
- Get us a pizza and some ice cream.

01:01:47.787 --> 01:01:51.874
- Ha-ha-ha! Or pay the consequences.
- Aah! Aah! Aah!

01:02:11.353 --> 01:02:12.700
All aboard.

01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:18.993
Got them.

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:25.074
We're not moving.

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:27.326
Huh?

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:29.161
Wait, let us out!

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:32.306
Open this door right now!

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:36.640
You, it was you all along.

01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:38.003
They tricked us.

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:40.898
- But how?
- Easy.

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:54.353
Looks like our work here is done.

01:02:54.354 --> 01:02:57.523
Zoinks, like, don't
speak too soon, Daph.

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:08.673
- Iago, you were the monster?
- No.

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:11.971
And it's not "Iago."

01:03:12.998 --> 01:03:17.599
It's Federal Agent Schmidlap from
the U.S. Department of Defense.

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:25.259
Three weeks ago, one of our
experimental exoskeletons...

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:28.762
<i>designed to increase the strength</i>
<i>of the infantrymen of the future...</i>

01:03:28.763 --> 01:03:31.974
was stolen from one
of our research labs.

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:35.870
I traced it to this town and went
undercover in hopes of ferreting it out.

01:03:36.563 --> 01:03:38.272
Go ahead, guys.

01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:40.733
Wait, you were the
monster in the lab?

01:03:40.734 --> 01:03:42.860
No, not me.

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:44.959
It was Burgermeister.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:48.741
But that's impossible.

01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:51.410
He was with Scooby and me
when we were, oh-ho-ho...

01:03:51.411 --> 01:03:53.662
chasing the Frankencreep.

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:57.416
Ah, but that's because someone else was
dressed like the Frankencreep at the time.

01:03:57.417 --> 01:04:01.420
This is one mystery that doesn't have
a culprit. It has a conspiracy.

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:04.673
Right. And that's why they
hypnotized you, Velma.

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:07.718
Hypnotized? Who
hypnotized you and why?

01:04:07.719 --> 01:04:10.929
And how did Scooby and I become
brave, not to mention full?

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:13.766
Like, that was the weirdest
feeling in the world.

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:19.772
Wait, wait. Most importantly, how on
earth did I end up in an inflatable suit?

01:04:19.773 --> 01:04:24.544
Okay, maybe not most importantly,
but I'd sure like to know. Spill.

01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:29.448
First of all, I didn't solve this mystery.
Fred had it figured out right away.

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:34.453
I did? I mean, I did. I did. Uh,
could you explain how I did?

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:37.164
You said it when the
Mystery Machine exploded.

01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:39.541
"This time it's personal."
And it was.

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:42.961
A personal attack
on the Scooby gang.

01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:45.435
Cuthbert Crawley?

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:48.133
Why would your family
lawyer want to destroy us?

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:51.720
He's not my family lawyer.
I'd never seen him before.

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:57.243
He's really Cuthbert Crawls, the
partner of Cosgoode Creeps.

01:04:57.394 --> 01:05:01.313
They were those creepy attorneys that
haunted the Beauregard Sanders Mansion...

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:02.991
as the green ghosts.

01:05:03.108 --> 01:05:07.486
What kind of a ghost would travel hundreds
of miles to haunt a lawyer's office, anyway?

01:05:07.487 --> 01:05:11.198
He wasn't there to scare us off.
He was there to draw us in.

01:05:11.199 --> 01:05:14.118
Everyone knows we
can't resist a mystery.

01:05:14.119 --> 01:05:18.372
<i>The so-called barons curse was supposed to</i>
<i>take away the things we cared about most.</i>

01:05:18.373 --> 01:05:21.017
<i>The first victim?</i>
<i>The Mystery Machine.</i>

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:25.838
The next victim was Daphne...

01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:29.007
<i>who started puffing up thanks</i>
<i>to her shellfish allergy.</i>

01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:33.929
<i>She had no way of knowing that she was also</i>
<i>slipping into its built-in inflatable suit.</i>

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:38.235
<i>And next up were Scooby and Shaggy,</i>
<i>whose suits were also rigged...</i>

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:42.146
<i>but with acupuncture needles</i>
<i>concealed carefully inside.</i>

01:05:42.147 --> 01:05:45.107
<i>The pressure points not</i>
<i>only suppressed hunger...</i>

01:05:45.108 --> 01:05:48.444
<i>they also created a false</i>
<i>sense of courage...</i>

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:50.946
<i>giving them the confidence</i>
<i>to chase after the monster.</i>

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:54.408
As for me, I was hypnotized
by Mrs. Vanders...

01:05:54.409 --> 01:05:57.661
into believing I could recreate
my uncle's experiment.

01:05:57.662 --> 01:06:01.707
<i>Which I did. At least, enough</i>
<i>to create a diversion.</i>

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:05.377
<i>A diversion for one of the conspirators</i>
<i>dressed as the Frankencreep...</i>

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:08.147
<i>to switch places with</i>
<i>the lifeless dummy.</i>

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:11.258
They sure went to a lot of
trouble to scare us off.

01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:14.386
But what was the treasure they
were trying to scare us off from?

01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:16.388
This time, it wasn't about money.

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:17.764
It was about us.

01:06:17.765 --> 01:06:21.435
- Huh?
- But why? Who would do such a thing?

01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:23.228
We don't even know these people.

01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:25.772
Don't be so sure.

01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:27.541
C.L. Magnus.?

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:32.237
Yes, the shipping magnate who
masqueraded as Redbeard's Ghost.

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:35.407
And as for our mysterious gypsy...

01:06:35.408 --> 01:06:36.867
Lila?

01:06:36.868 --> 01:06:41.788
Yes. Aspiring pop singer Lila, who
was one of Mamba Wamba's zombies.

01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:44.791
That means this is no housekeeper.

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:46.460
Mama Mione?

01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:47.753
Mama Mione?

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:51.900
You were, like, a criminal gang leader
pretending to be Old Iron Face.

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:53.926
Jeepers, of course.

01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:56.637
I should've recognized that mask.

01:06:56.638 --> 01:06:59.598
I guess even criminals recycle.

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:03.769
You get it? Recycle.

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:08.826
Who would've thought there'd be a conspiracy
of people determined to destroy us?

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:10.609
Are you kidding?

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:13.529
<i>Everyone you've ever</i>
<i>busted wants revenge.</i>

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:15.782
<i>We were turning people</i>
<i>away in droves.</i>

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:24.248
We fiended each other on the Scooby
Gang Revenge social-networking page.

01:07:24.249 --> 01:07:27.428
You wouldn't believe how many
yikes it gets on a daily basis.

01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:31.838
It took us months, but once we found
out about Dinkley's family...

01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:34.174
we pooled our resources
and bought the castle.

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:38.303
Then we slowly insinuated ourselves into
the town with our chosen identities.

01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:43.267
Imagine our joy when we discovered the
natural-gas pockets under the estate.

01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:46.071
The castle became one
enormous death trap.

01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:48.981
And we would've gotten our
revenge on you meddling kids.

01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:52.317
If it weren't for
you meddling kids.

01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:54.403
One thing I still don't get.

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:57.698
Once you discovered the gas,
why didn't you just sell the land?

01:07:57.699 --> 01:07:59.741
- Huh?
- I mean, if you sold the rights...

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:04.329
to the natural gas under the castle you'd
be rich beyond your wildest dreams.

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:06.456
Huh?

01:08:07.667 --> 01:08:10.168
- Why? Why?
- That would've been a good thing to do.

01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:15.340
Like, you were so greedy for revenge,
you forgot to be greedy for money.

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:27.227
Jeepers, Velma, you've really
won the villagers over.

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:30.154
I guess they really appreciate
you proving once and for all...

01:08:30.156 --> 01:08:33.500
that there's no such thing as
the Von Dinkenstein curse.

01:08:36.821 --> 01:08:41.037
Maybe. Or it could have something to do
with my giving them the land rights...

01:08:41.063 --> 01:08:44.368
- to the natural gas.
- Huh? You what?

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:47.788
It's the least I could do after what
my ancestors put them through.

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:50.388
Well, gang, the wagon's
all set to go.

01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:54.379
It should only take us about 27
hours to get to the next town.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:58.544
Not so fast, Fred. The Department
of Defense really appreciates

01:08:58.569 --> 01:09:01.094
all of your help in recovering
the prototype. And...

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:04.399
well, we have a little
surprise for you.

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:07.267
The Mystery Machine!

01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:13.231
Baby.

01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:15.567
I thought I'd never see you again.

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:18.444
Oh, come to Papa. Mwah.

01:09:18.446 --> 01:09:20.214
Oh, for the love of...

01:09:20.531 --> 01:09:22.908
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:25.618
Fred, uh, why don't you
take her for a spin?

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:30.290
You may find a few hidden extras on her
courtesy of the Department of Defense.

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:33.560
Come on, gang. Let's get
this show on the road.

01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:36.254
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:39.091
There's just one last thing
I don't understand, Velma.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:41.051
How did you know the
curse was a fake?

01:09:41.051 --> 01:09:44.554
Easy, Daphne. The baron's curse
said that the victims would lose...

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:47.765
what they love the most and
then be utterly destroyed.

01:09:47.767 --> 01:09:49.363
Hmm.

01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:52.312
Guys, don't you see?

01:09:52.313 --> 01:09:58.360
Of all the things we lost, beauty,
confidence, the joy of eating, logic...

01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:00.629
none of it was what
we loved the most.

01:10:04.075 --> 01:10:06.127
We love each other the most.

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:08.120
Aw.

01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:09.718
That's nice.

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:12.791
Mm.

01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:14.835
Acupuncture or no acupuncture...

01:10:14.836 --> 01:10:19.047
I can't believe we ever passed up
on this awesome <i>blutenwursten.</i>

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:20.799
I know. Hee-hee.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.509
It's delicious.

01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:25.887
You know, Scoob, one thing this
little adventure did teach me...

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:28.807
was that we can be just
as brave as anyone.

01:10:28.808 --> 01:10:30.016
Yeah.

01:10:30.017 --> 01:10:34.229
And from now on, you and I will
be the fearless furry twosome.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:35.998
- Deal.
- Ha!

01:10:38.317 --> 01:10:41.153
That's odd. I've never
noticed this button before.

01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:44.656
It must be one of the surprises
that Agent Schmidlap mentioned.

01:10:44.657 --> 01:10:48.302
- Let's see what it does.
- Oh, Freddy, I don't know about that.

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:52.674
What the heck? Go for it.

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:14.154
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

01:11:17.732 --> 01:11:19.983
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.</i>

01:11:19.984 --> 01:11:21.193
<i>That's it?</i>

01:11:21.194 --> 01:11:23.236
<i>But there's so many</i>
<i>unanswered questions.</i>

01:11:23.237 --> 01:11:26.156
<i>I mean, what about this?</i>

01:11:26.157 --> 01:11:32.454
<i>Shaggy is wearing underwear in this scene,</i>
<i>but moments later, he's wearing pants.</i>

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:36.041
<i>Where did he get them from? Are we</i>
<i>expected to believe that this is real?</i>

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:38.210
<i>Does he have magic pants?</i>

01:11:38.211 --> 01:11:40.212
<i>Please.</i>

01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:43.062
<i>And what about this?</i>

01:11:44.217 --> 01:11:48.553
<i>The train engine smashes into the tower</i>
<i>clock in this scene, but later...</i>

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:53.016
<i>ba-da-boom, its working again?</i>
<i>Clearly this is a mistake, right?</i>

01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:54.893
<i>And what about the train engine?</i>

01:11:54.894 --> 01:11:58.396
<i>It went up in smoke,</i>
<i>but later again...</i>

01:11:58.397 --> 01:12:02.901
<i>bam, there it is. Please.</i>

01:12:02.902 --> 01:12:07.447
<i>Bogus. Are we expected to swallow</i>
<i>all of this nonsense and believe...?</i>

01:12:07.448 --> 01:12:11.618
<i>What? Hey, you just</i>
<i>can't... What the...?</i>

01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:13.967
<i>Mommy!</i>

01:12:14.305 --> 01:12:20.944
