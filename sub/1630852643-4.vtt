WEBVTT

00:25.150 --> 00:27.069
Dance your cares away

00:27.152 --> 00:29.238
Worry's for another day

00:29.321 --> 00:31.323
Let the music play

00:31.406 --> 00:33.367
Down at Fraggle Rock

00:33.450 --> 00:35.369
Work your cares away

00:35.452 --> 00:37.663
Dancing's for another day

00:37.746 --> 00:39.331
Let the Fraggles play

00:39.414 --> 00:40.415
-We're Gobo.
-Mokey.

00:40.499 --> 00:41.291
-Wembley.
-Boober.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.251
Red

00:45.838 --> 00:47.297
Junior!

00:47.381 --> 00:48.715
Hello!

00:48.799 --> 00:51.009
My radish.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.388
Dance your cares away

00:54.471 --> 00:56.515
Worry's for another day

00:56.598 --> 00:58.308
Let the music play

00:58.392 --> 01:02.145
Down at Fraggle Rock
Down at Fraggle Rock

01:02.688 --> 01:04.230
Down at Fraggle Rock.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.693
I Pop 'n Bop awake.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.319
I Pop 'n Bop in bed.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.154
I never stop the Pop 'n Bop.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.781
I Pop 'n Bop to Red!

01:12.865 --> 01:14.575
I Pop 'n Bop great…

01:14.658 --> 01:16.618
…like a Pop 'n Bop assembly.

01:16.702 --> 01:20.080
I Pop 'n Bop
over to my good friend, Wembley.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.209
Mokey, Mokey, Mokey!

01:24.293 --> 01:26.628
Mokey, Mokey, Pop 'n Bop.

01:26.712 --> 01:28.505
Mokey, Mokey, Mokey.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.216
When it comes to Pop 'n Bop,

01:31.300 --> 01:33.427
I know how to maneuver.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.345
-Nice.
-So it's upside down

01:35.429 --> 01:37.598
and over to my Boober.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.601
Yeah! Come on, Boober.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.562
Where the heck is Boober?

01:43.645 --> 01:46.857
I'll go check his cave.
Maybe he has snacks.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.818
Oh. Well, if we're calling
a Pop 'n Bop Stop,

01:49.902 --> 01:53.363
I'm gonna head up to Outer Space
and see if Uncle Matt sent more goodies.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.573
Okay.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.825
-Hand-walking race.
-What?

01:56.909 --> 01:58.744
Go, go, go!

02:01.955 --> 02:03.540
Perfect.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.252
-Hey, Boober.
-Ah, Wembley.

02:08.336 --> 02:12.466
Behold, the single greatest laundry device
known to Fragglekind.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.676
-Wow.
-Bye-bye, wrinkles.

02:15.260 --> 02:18.055
Smooth as a newborn baby Merggle.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.768
-B-- Boober!
-Wha--

02:22.851 --> 02:26.021
-Your baloobius is on fire!
-Huh?

02:26.104 --> 02:28.440
-It's not on fire. I-I-It's glowing.
-What--

02:28.524 --> 02:30.901
W-W-What's happening?
I don't know what this is.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.487
-It's never happened before.
-It's no biggie, Boober.

02:33.570 --> 02:37.157
-Actually, it's pretty cool.
-No, no, Wembley. It's not cool.

02:37.241 --> 02:40.577
W-What it is-- It's nothing, see?
Nothing, because it never happened.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.454
-Understand?
-O-- Okay.

02:44.373 --> 02:45.874
-Wembley.
-Huh? Whoa. What--

02:45.958 --> 02:48.585
Promise me
you'll never tell anybody about this ever!

02:48.669 --> 02:50.170
Promise!

02:50.254 --> 02:52.589
O-Okay, Boober, I-- I-I promise.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.842
Okay.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.805
Hi, buddy.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.933
Oh, okay. Okay.
I know. It's very exciting.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.894
Hi-- Okay, okay. Hi, hi, hi, hi.

03:05.978 --> 03:09.648
Yeah, I kinda like you too, Sprockie.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.359
So I'm out there
collecting my water samples, right?

03:12.442 --> 03:15.362
And you would not believe
the amount of trash on the beach.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.949
So I started picking it up,
and before I knew it, my bag was full.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.201
Look at me.
I'm the Santa Claus of garbage.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.249
Another package for Gobo?

03:28.208 --> 03:29.376
What if I'm Gobo?

03:29.459 --> 03:30.460
Like a nickname.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.379
I had an aunt that called me Gobo.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.631
Wait, no, she called me Yo-Yo.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.676
Huh? You gotta be kidding me.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.179
Someone mailed me a water bottle?

03:40.262 --> 03:43.015
Trash in the ocean.
Trash in the mail.

03:43.098 --> 03:45.350
This is a serious problem
for our environment.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.270
I'm starting to believe
the world's having a trash party.

03:50.772 --> 03:51.607
Got it.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.237
Who in the world would send
a plastic bottle?

03:57.321 --> 03:59.114
It's me…

03:59.198 --> 04:00.782
Your Uncle Travelling Matt.

04:00.866 --> 04:02.993
I was recently at the edge of Outer Space,

04:03.076 --> 04:05.787
where, not to bog you down
with scientific jargon,

04:05.871 --> 04:08.540
but hard stuff meets wet stuff.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.461
There lay a shiny artifact
unlike any other.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.713
Its name came to me instantly.

04:14.796 --> 04:15.797
Bizzle!

04:15.881 --> 04:18.425
And its purpose was immediately clear
to me.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.135
Secret collecting.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.014
I'm scared of my mustache.

04:29.645 --> 04:31.730
And just like that, it was gone.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.899
Was I sad? Of course.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.527
Did I show it? Not even one time.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.619
Don't worry, Gobo.
Heroes only have very brief low points

04:45.702 --> 04:47.871
followed by huge victories.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.332
I vowed never to lose it again.

04:50.415 --> 04:55.379
Gobo, build a museum in Fraggle Rock,
and place the Bizzle inside it.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.923
You can call it something understated like

04:58.006 --> 05:02.135
"The Uncle Travelling Matt Museum--
Hooray, Uncle Travelling Matt."

05:02.219 --> 05:04.888
Love, your Uncle Travelling Matt.

05:05.389 --> 05:09.518
"PS: To ensure
this rare Bizzle is well-documented,

05:09.601 --> 05:12.563
I've sent for The Archivist
to come visit."

05:12.646 --> 05:15.774
-The Archivist?
-Wow! The Archivist.

05:15.858 --> 05:18.110
Keeper of all important treasures…

05:18.193 --> 05:20.612
…coming to help us
with the Bizzle of Secrets.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.365
Bizzle of Secrets. Cool!

05:23.448 --> 05:25.033
Especially for me,

05:25.117 --> 05:28.203
someone who currently isn't keeping
any secrets currently.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.081
Well, it's no secret…

05:31.164 --> 05:34.626
…that I'm completely pumped
The Archivist is coming.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.753
Oh, she's so worldly and traveled and…

05:37.379 --> 05:38.630
honestly a lot like me.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.842
Mystical creatures.

05:50.642 --> 05:55.522
I don't know what it is, but she's got it.

05:55.606 --> 05:57.024
-Yeah.
-Yeah, beautiful.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.692
-Glorious!
-Just stunning.

05:58.775 --> 05:59.985
-Ravishing.
-Absolutely.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.404
-Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Now back to me.
-Wha--

06:04.448 --> 06:06.700
Hey. Hey, Boober,
come have a closer look, eh?

06:06.783 --> 06:08.368
He's fine there.

06:09.536 --> 06:13.332
Uh, you know how some Fraggles can
see better from far away?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.585
That's Boober.

06:17.169 --> 06:19.588
-Oh, yes, yes. I've heard that.
-Oh, right. Yeah.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.389
Water.

06:29.473 --> 06:32.267
This water's wet.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.104
-Are you thirsty?
-Wha--

06:36.188 --> 06:38.690
Junior, what are you doing?

06:38.774 --> 06:42.402
Well-- Well, I-- I thought
since we had so much water,

06:42.486 --> 06:45.906
I could spare a tiny scooch
for the plants?

06:45.989 --> 06:47.407
-No.
-And the trees?

06:47.491 --> 06:49.034
-No.
-And the vegetables?

06:49.117 --> 06:50.118
No!

06:50.202 --> 06:53.121
No more loving things. Capoosh?

06:53.205 --> 06:55.707
Capoosh.

07:04.508 --> 07:05.801
Thirsty.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.306
W-- Whoa-- Wha-- Wha--

07:11.390 --> 07:12.891
-Junior! Stop her!
-Yeah?

07:12.975 --> 07:14.810
On it, Pa!

07:14.893 --> 07:16.395
Okay.

07:19.940 --> 07:24.319
That is the last time
a Fraggle steals our precious water.

07:25.237 --> 07:29.032
We need to find a way to protect it
and flaunt it.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.910
Like a fountain?

07:31.994 --> 07:35.747
No. Like a fountain!

07:35.831 --> 07:38.083
Right, Pa.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.169
The Archivist is gonna be here any minute.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.880
We have to figure out
where to put Uncle Matt's museum.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.715
Yeah, um…

07:44.798 --> 07:47.593
What about
the Cave of Everlasting Darkness?

07:49.553 --> 07:51.096
Uh, it's a little dark.

07:51.180 --> 07:54.057
I know.
We should try Sticky Floor Cave.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.727
Nah, too sticky.
Boober, you've been awfully quiet.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.645
Not 'cause he's hiding anything.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.191
Maybe we should try Rock Shelf Cave.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.903
Well, this is just perfect.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.863
Three cheers for Boober Fraggle.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.908
Cheers, cheers, cheers, cheers!

08:10.991 --> 08:11.950
-That was four.
-Yeah.

08:12.034 --> 08:13.535
Uh, it was nothing.

08:14.369 --> 08:17.539
Uh, celebratory, uh, Pop 'n Bop?

08:19.541 --> 08:21.251
Pop 'n Bop?

08:21.335 --> 08:22.586
Ah! Oh, no.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.671
What am I gonna do? I-I gotta hide it.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.845
-Wembley?
-Yeah?

08:31.929 --> 08:34.306
-What did you just do?
-Uh, well…

08:34.847 --> 08:37.643
No-- H-- The-- The Bizzle.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.852
-You put the Bizzle on my--
-Yeah.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.649
Hello?

08:43.732 --> 08:48.987
If anybody is interested,
The Archivist is here.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.281
It's me. Hi.

08:51.365 --> 08:52.783
The Archivist.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.785
Warmest hellos.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.703
I'm Red!

08:56.787 --> 08:59.081
Hello, my little Fraggle sweeties.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.207
-Hello.
-Hi.

09:00.290 --> 09:04.253
-Welcome.
-Now, where is that infamous Bizzle?

09:04.336 --> 09:06.797
Oh, well, it's, uh--

09:06.880 --> 09:10.384
Oh, no. The Bizzle is missing.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.427
What happened to it?

09:19.476 --> 09:22.938
But you did actually have
the Bizzle, right?

09:23.021 --> 09:24.147
Oh, yeah. Totally.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.441
You didn't just dream it up?

09:26.525 --> 09:27.818
-No, no, no.
-Oh, no.

09:27.901 --> 09:32.239
But I actually have very vivid dreams
that I'd love to talk to you about.

09:32.322 --> 09:36.118
-My dream is to find the Bizzle. Okay?
-That's my cue to find the Bizzle.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.871
-Here, Bizzle.
-Well, we're gonna find that Bizzle.

09:38.954 --> 09:39.955
We swear.

09:40.038 --> 09:43.959
Well, you're an earnest little Fraggle,
and I believe you.

09:44.042 --> 09:47.379
But if your vest is the biggest treasure
I see on this trip,

09:47.462 --> 09:49.965
I'm gonna be pretty disappointed.

09:50.674 --> 09:51.675
But I do like it.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.594
It's a very cute look.

09:53.677 --> 09:55.429
Oh, well… Yeah.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.723
I have two of them.

09:59.057 --> 10:02.686
-The Bizzle. I'm gonna go get the Bizzle.
-Yes. Thank you.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.354
It's not over here.

10:04.438 --> 10:07.065
Why did you put the Bizzle
on my baloobius?

10:07.149 --> 10:09.860
As you may have noticed, it's see-through.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.988
Yeah, I realize that now.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.156
Oh, but don't worry.

10:14.239 --> 10:16.992
All we need to do is
sneak it back to the museum.

10:17.075 --> 10:18.994
-Yeah?
-And here's how…

10:21.079 --> 10:23.916
I disguise myself
as the World's Oldest Fraggle

10:23.999 --> 10:26.960
and wait until
the real World's Oldest takes a nap.

10:27.044 --> 10:30.631
When he does, I'll write everyone a note
saying I'm sleepy,

10:30.714 --> 10:34.343
covering my tracks,
allowing me to tunnel into the museum.

10:34.426 --> 10:37.012
Merggle Queen.

10:38.430 --> 10:42.142
Then Henchy will enter and say…

10:42.226 --> 10:44.269
You're not the World's Oldest Fraggle.

10:44.353 --> 10:45.437
And I'll say…

10:45.521 --> 10:46.855
Yes, I am.

10:46.939 --> 10:49.233
-And she'll say…
-Prove it.

10:49.316 --> 10:53.070
-And I'll say…
-Uh… I'm so old.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.363
Wait, what?

10:54.446 --> 10:58.158
Why don't you stick it under your shirt
and sneak it back to the shelf?

11:00.285 --> 11:02.663
That's so crazy, it just might work.

11:02.746 --> 11:05.165
Okay, um…
One more time, Boober?

11:05.249 --> 11:08.377
Oh, sure, why not? What could go wrong--

11:08.460 --> 11:11.797
I thought that that would work.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.091
Wembley, let go of my tail.

11:15.384 --> 11:17.928
Okay, a few bruises.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.596
It's still stuck.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.558
Perfect.
The one thing I'm trying to hide is stuck

11:22.641 --> 11:25.644
under the one thing
that all of Fraggle Rock is looking for.

11:25.727 --> 11:29.273
Uh, Boober, I don't think
everyone's looking for the Bizzle.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.693
-Everyone's looking for the Bizzle.
-Have you seen it?

11:32.776 --> 11:33.944
No.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.654
G-- Absolutely not.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.990
Let us know if you find it.

11:40.742 --> 11:43.495
Oh, perfect. This is just perfect.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.879
What if I'm the strange one?

11:52.504 --> 11:54.840
What if I don't look like everyone?

11:56.133 --> 11:59.386
And the walls start to cave
And the rocks all fall

12:01.847 --> 12:03.932
What if I feel afraid?

12:04.016 --> 12:06.602
And a part of me feels ashamed?

12:06.685 --> 12:09.980
And this baloobius tail
And its luminous glare

12:10.063 --> 12:12.733
Just lights up all my flaws?

12:13.734 --> 12:17.362
So can it just glow, glow away?

12:19.865 --> 12:24.036
Can I just be
Be the same as everybody else?

12:24.786 --> 12:27.915
'Cause every time
That the lights start dimming

12:27.998 --> 12:30.375
Knees start to shake
And my head starts spinning

12:30.459 --> 12:33.587
I'm scared that they'll stare
At my baloobius tail

12:33.670 --> 12:35.005
It's true

12:36.840 --> 12:39.927
My mind is a mess
And I can't stop stressing

12:40.010 --> 12:42.721
Every move I keep second-guessing

12:42.804 --> 12:45.182
I find at the end of the day

12:45.265 --> 12:48.185
I wish it would glow, glow, glow

12:48.268 --> 12:51.188
I wish it would glow, glow, glow

12:51.271 --> 12:57.736
I wish it would glow, glow, glow away

13:01.490 --> 13:03.075
Yeah.

13:03.158 --> 13:06.703
A sock. I made it "glow" away.

13:08.372 --> 13:09.331
You can thank me later.

13:12.793 --> 13:16.463
How hard is it to walk over
to the recycling bin on the beach?

13:21.760 --> 13:22.803
You know, Sprocket,

13:22.886 --> 13:25.848
I can spend my whole day
fishing plastic out of the ocean,

13:25.931 --> 13:29.393
but if the rest of the world
keeps tossing trash around like confetti,

13:29.476 --> 13:31.436
what difference does it make?

13:31.520 --> 13:35.440
At least I've been able to use some of
the trash I found for this contraption.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.407
And that's how Doc dunks a cookie.

13:46.660 --> 13:47.995
Goes down chunky.

13:48.954 --> 13:51.665
Oh, look, Sprocket, some plastic garbage.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.501
Whatever should I do with it?
Throw it in the ocean?

13:54.585 --> 13:57.629
Mail it to some fake person named Gobo?

13:57.713 --> 14:01.258
I have a wild idea.
How about I put it in this recycling bin?

14:02.301 --> 14:03.594
Wait a minute.

14:07.139 --> 14:08.473
Oh, my gosh.

14:08.557 --> 14:11.602
Sprocket, there isn't a recycling bin
on the beach.

14:12.269 --> 14:15.063
Someone should do something.
I should do something.

14:15.147 --> 14:18.233
I don't have to be like everyone else.
I can be part of the solution.

14:19.610 --> 14:20.694
Aw, buddy.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.155
That's too many biscuits.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.744
-No.
-No, no, Wembley. It's no use.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.579
It's really stuck.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.790
-What are you guys talking about?
-Oh! Uh, well--

14:33.874 --> 14:35.918
-Just-- Just--
-Boober's bal-- Uh, uh--

14:36.001 --> 14:38.962
-Everybody clap your hands! Clap, clap.
-Yeah.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.964
Is that the Bizzle?

14:41.048 --> 14:44.009
-What is it doing on your baloobius?
-Uh, Bizzle?

14:44.092 --> 14:47.596
Well, Boober here was ironing his clothes,
which-- which he does,

14:47.679 --> 14:49.806
and he, uh, sat on the Bizzle.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.059
-And, uh, now it's stuck.
-Yes.

14:52.142 --> 14:54.895
-Due to no fault of his own.
-None.

14:54.978 --> 14:58.232
You know, I consider myself
an excellent judge of character…

15:00.108 --> 15:03.028
…and I believe everything you just said.
Let me help.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.571
-Oh, great. Thanks.
-Please, please.

15:04.655 --> 15:07.533
Let's see. Uh, let's get rid of this.

15:07.616 --> 15:10.452
-Let me just grab it. Ready, and--
-Okay.

15:13.497 --> 15:16.625
Oh, you guys playing Tug-o'-Tails?

15:16.708 --> 15:17.751
Well, you see--

15:17.835 --> 15:19.545
The Bizzle!

15:19.628 --> 15:21.046
-I can explain.
-Wha--

15:21.129 --> 15:23.799
Uh, uh-- The-- The Bizzle fell and…

15:23.882 --> 15:27.469
…and Boober heroically stretched out
his baloobius to catch it--

15:27.553 --> 15:29.930
W-- Wait a minute.
You told me that Boober

15:30.013 --> 15:32.766
-sat on the Bizzle.
-Oh, wait a minute. I got this.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.643
Okay, Boober. Turn around.

15:34.726 --> 15:37.229
-Okay.
-Here we go. Here we go.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.481
You're in good hands, Boober. Here we go.

15:39.565 --> 15:41.066
-Don't close your eyes!
-Be gentle.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.026
We're coming around.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.904
Be gentle-- Oh! Off the ground.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.907
Hey, guys. I-- Whoa! Watch out--

15:48.991 --> 15:51.743
Hey-- Wha-- What's going on in here?

15:54.746 --> 15:58.542
The Bizzle came to life
and was obsessed with Boober.

15:59.710 --> 16:00.627
Wha-- What?

16:00.711 --> 16:04.715
I don't care how that Bizzle got on there.
Boober's our friend and needs help.

16:04.798 --> 16:08.510
And I know who can solve this problem.

16:09.678 --> 16:12.639
-Doozers can fix anything.
-The Doozers can do it.

16:12.723 --> 16:15.058
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
-It's gonna be good.

16:16.518 --> 16:17.728
I feel that.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.521
-Don't think so.
-Hey. I feel that.

16:24.818 --> 16:27.029
This repair will take hours.

16:27.613 --> 16:30.240
Yeah! All right! That's amazing!

16:30.324 --> 16:31.992
Nope. It's stuck.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.828
We could always rub greaseberry leaves
on you, Boober.

16:34.912 --> 16:37.664
No, no, no, no, no.
We'll wedge the Bizzle in some rocks

16:37.748 --> 16:39.249
and then dive you off a cliff!

16:39.333 --> 16:40.542
No way!

16:40.626 --> 16:44.338
What we need to do is form a circle,
hold hands, and dance it off.

16:47.299 --> 16:49.218
Enough!

16:49.301 --> 16:52.679
If everyone needs the Bizzle
back in the museum so badly,

16:52.763 --> 16:56.558
then it'll go back to the museum
stuck to my tail.

16:59.770 --> 17:03.106
Making a fountain for my bossy dad

17:03.190 --> 17:06.818
Making a fountain so my pa's not mad

17:06.902 --> 17:08.779
Wow, that's heavy.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.531
Oh, look at you.

17:11.615 --> 17:14.326
Little baby sapling.

17:15.743 --> 17:17.538
Look at you.

17:18.121 --> 17:21.959
I sure do wanna tend to you,
but I shouldn't.

17:22.626 --> 17:24.837
My daddy told me not to.

17:24.920 --> 17:28.214
But maybe just this once.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.427
You're like my little guy.

17:32.511 --> 17:34.721
Like my Junior.

17:34.805 --> 17:37.724
Junior Junior.

17:37.808 --> 17:39.935
Yeah. I like that.

17:41.103 --> 17:43.772
There's some water for you, Junior Junior.

17:53.031 --> 17:55.784
Well, I guess I live here now.

17:56.660 --> 17:58.745
At least it's quiet.

17:58.829 --> 18:00.289
Hi!

18:00.372 --> 18:01.999
Hi, I'm Joogie.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.710
You just move in? Welcome!

18:04.793 --> 18:07.212
Okay, I'll stay out of your hair.

18:09.798 --> 18:13.844
I'm so sorry.
I forget how silky my steps are sometimes.

18:15.220 --> 18:18.265
May I ask why you're sitting
on a shelf in the museum

18:18.348 --> 18:21.310
with what looks to be
the Bizzle of Secrets on your tail?

18:21.393 --> 18:25.480
Oh, well, I just think someone should
be here to, uh-- to protect the Bizzle.

18:25.564 --> 18:27.107
And what's more secure

18:27.191 --> 18:29.610
than actually attaching it
to your body, right?

18:30.944 --> 18:35.365
You know, I used to spend
a lot of time hiding my baloobius too.

18:35.449 --> 18:38.911
-Huh?
-I grew up near Shh Pond.

18:38.994 --> 18:40.954
-Which pond?
-Shh.

18:41.538 --> 18:45.167
-Which pond?
-No, no, no. It's called Shh Pond.

18:45.834 --> 18:46.877
Oh, sorry.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.339
-Boy, that must happen all the time, huh?
-No, that's the first time.

18:50.422 --> 18:51.423
Sorry.

18:51.507 --> 18:54.259
Anyways, not a lot of glowing
where I'm from.

18:54.343 --> 18:57.054
-Glowing?
-I felt like I was the only one.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.264
You glow too?

18:59.348 --> 19:02.768
I-- I-I mean, you glow? Because I don't.
Why would I glow?

19:02.851 --> 19:05.395
Uh, so…
you must travel a lot for work, huh?

19:05.479 --> 19:07.648
I do glow, yes.

19:07.731 --> 19:11.068
Whenever I feel most at ease with myself.

19:11.777 --> 19:13.570
It's glorious.

19:13.654 --> 19:17.866
You know, I spent so much of my life
sitting on the edge of that lonely pond

19:17.950 --> 19:19.701
with my tail in the water,

19:19.785 --> 19:22.329
just desperate to hide my glow.

19:22.412 --> 19:26.834
And then one day,
I realized I could be more.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.504
I could be me.

19:31.088 --> 19:33.006
Sometimes when I'm dreaming

19:33.090 --> 19:37.761
Of a special secret place I love
Inside of me

19:37.845 --> 19:40.138
Hiding me

19:40.222 --> 19:43.892
Then I get the feeling
There's a different me appearing

19:43.976 --> 19:48.647
And it's time to be more than me

19:54.444 --> 19:56.280
I can chase the wind

19:56.363 --> 19:58.782
I can race the rain

19:58.866 --> 20:01.118
I can trace the track
A flash of lightning makes

20:01.201 --> 20:02.953
And make it flash again

20:03.036 --> 20:05.163
I can taste the sun

20:05.247 --> 20:07.457
I can taste the sky

20:07.541 --> 20:09.209
I can taste the world

20:09.293 --> 20:11.795
That races by me
As my heart begins to fly

20:11.879 --> 20:13.338
I can chase the wind

20:16.592 --> 20:18.677
Sometimes there's a part of me

20:18.760 --> 20:23.390
That wells up in the heart of me
And wants to fly

20:23.473 --> 20:25.017
Fly up high

20:25.517 --> 20:29.438
When I feel the feeling start
I let it take me from the heart

20:29.521 --> 20:33.567
And by and by I can fly

20:35.652 --> 20:37.738
-I can chase the wind
-I can chase the wind

20:37.821 --> 20:39.823
-I can race the rain
-I can race the rain

20:39.907 --> 20:42.242
I can trace the track
A flash of lightning makes

20:42.326 --> 20:44.119
And make it flash again

20:44.203 --> 20:46.330
-I can taste the sun
-I can taste the sun

20:46.413 --> 20:48.457
-I can taste the sky
-I can taste the sky

20:48.540 --> 20:51.001
I can taste the world
That races by me

20:51.084 --> 20:53.086
As my heart begins to fly

20:53.170 --> 20:54.922
-I can chase the wind
-I can chase the wind

20:55.005 --> 20:57.132
-I can chase the wind
-I can chase the wind

20:57.216 --> 21:01.178
I can chase the wind

21:04.097 --> 21:05.349
I thought I was alone.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.519
I thought glowing was bad.

21:08.602 --> 21:11.647
Glowing can't be bad.

21:11.730 --> 21:12.940
Look at me.

21:13.023 --> 21:15.817
I'm pretty dang cool.

21:19.071 --> 21:20.822
Wha--

21:23.867 --> 21:26.078
Incredi-Bizzle.

21:26.161 --> 21:28.539
Incredi-baloobius.

21:30.624 --> 21:33.752
I'm scared of my mustache.

21:33.836 --> 21:37.214
-Boober, what's happening?
-Whatever it is, we love you!

21:37.297 --> 21:40.717
Don't you worry. I didn't tell them
about the thing that didn't happen.

21:40.801 --> 21:43.679
Guys, there's something
I need to show you all,

21:43.762 --> 21:46.849
and it-- I'm worried
you're gonna not like it.

21:46.932 --> 21:47.975
What?

21:48.767 --> 21:49.977
It's this.

21:51.270 --> 21:54.940
-I know you're gonna think it's weird--
-It's like a party on your tail.

21:55.023 --> 21:56.608
It's cooltastic!

21:56.692 --> 21:59.111
It's like something out of a dream I had.

21:59.194 --> 22:01.113
My dreams hold mystical powers.

22:01.196 --> 22:02.906
You don't think it's weird?

22:02.990 --> 22:04.408
Weirdly awesome.

22:05.242 --> 22:07.703
Come on, tail. Do something.

22:09.037 --> 22:14.042
Well, now with the Bizzle secure
here in the, uh…

22:14.126 --> 22:17.671
Oh, the Travelling Matt Museum
of Travelling Matt-- Hooray, Matt Museum.

22:17.754 --> 22:19.673
Gosh, that is catchy.

22:19.756 --> 22:24.720
It certainly is.
Well, with it open, my job here is done.

22:24.803 --> 22:29.850
Boober,
we all glow in our own special ways.

22:29.933 --> 22:31.476
And you know what?

22:31.560 --> 22:36.023
Being your own true,
special self is the only way to be.

22:36.106 --> 22:37.107
Yeah.

22:38.817 --> 22:40.652
I can't believe you're so cool!

22:40.736 --> 22:42.070
Oh, thanks.

22:43.405 --> 22:46.366
Here it goes. And…

22:46.450 --> 22:47.659
Boom!

22:47.743 --> 22:49.369
Bottle in the bin!

22:49.453 --> 22:51.371
Bottle in the bin

22:51.455 --> 22:53.081
Bottle in the bin

22:54.583 --> 22:58.212
It's the simplest thing in the world,
and it's already made a difference.

22:58.295 --> 23:00.839
Every bottle is one less
that goes into the ocean.

23:02.132 --> 23:04.801
It's all about the little things.

23:11.975 --> 23:13.977
No matter who you are,

23:14.061 --> 23:17.981
no matter whether your glow shines
outside or in,

23:18.065 --> 23:21.443
when you love your specialness
for what it is,

23:21.527 --> 23:25.948
it becomes
the brightest treasure in the world.
