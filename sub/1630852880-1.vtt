01:23.593 --> 01:24.694
Wake up!

01:31.366 --> 01:32.835
- Come on!
- Come on!

01:32.869 --> 01:34.771
There's no way
he's gonna get in.

01:34.804 --> 01:36.405
It's not cold.

04:03.119 --> 04:04.587
She's looking at you.

04:09.659 --> 04:11.761
- She's not his type.
- She could be my type.

04:12.995 --> 04:14.764
- She wasn't looking at you.
- Could've been.

04:14.797 --> 04:17.834
- Mm.
- Stop it.

04:17.867 --> 04:18.701
Hello. Good evening.

04:18.733 --> 04:21.003
These are our premium steaks
for tonight.

04:21.036 --> 04:24.807
We have the 200 gram rib eye
and the 400 gram cattle prod.

04:28.611 --> 04:29.946
I give you doubles.

04:30.478 --> 04:31.479
Ooh.

04:34.449 --> 04:36.052
- Mum?
- Hmm?

04:36.085 --> 04:38.453
Joining in?

04:38.486 --> 04:40.056
- Uh...
- There's only two of us playing. Come on.

04:40.089 --> 04:41.691
Just a sec. Just a sec.

04:42.725 --> 04:44.559
- Wait, wait.
- Are you working?

04:44.594 --> 04:45.828
I am.

04:45.862 --> 04:47.864
- Get off your phone!
- Just a... No...

04:49.699 --> 04:50.867
This is stupid.

04:50.900 --> 04:52.168
- No work.
- I don't want to play.

04:52.201 --> 04:54.536
- Ten minutes, no work.
- Why?

04:54.569 --> 04:58.506
I... This is the first time
I took my phone, in a day.

04:58.540 --> 04:59.842
- Nearly.
- Mm.

05:00.943 --> 05:02.612
Well, you're not
getting it back.

05:02.645 --> 05:03.713
Not until you play.

05:04.614 --> 05:06.949
- Come on!
- Are you playing?

05:06.983 --> 05:08.150
This has nothing to do
with me.

05:08.184 --> 05:09.752
We're talking to you.

05:09.785 --> 05:10.820
- Come here.
- Come on.

05:10.853 --> 05:12.688
- I never liked dominoes.
- All right...

05:12.722 --> 05:14.924
- Come on, give me my phone.
- We'll restart the game.

05:16.659 --> 05:18.060
- Pfft!
- Come on!

06:00.136 --> 06:01.904
You want a picture?

06:01.938 --> 06:03.773
No, thank you.

06:03.806 --> 06:07.143
You're right. He does
look better from a distance.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.545
Okay, come on,
come on, let's go.

06:20.555 --> 06:21.991
Thanks for coming with us.

06:22.658 --> 06:23.659
Hmm.

06:25.061 --> 06:26.228
I'm happy to.

06:29.231 --> 06:30.532
The kids are having fun.

07:44.640 --> 07:46.175
- Morning.
- Morning.

07:47.810 --> 07:49.078
Uh, which one has tequila?

07:49.111 --> 07:50.279
These two over here.

07:50.312 --> 07:52.114
Ah. Thank you.

07:52.148 --> 07:53.682
It's a pleasure.

08:00.222 --> 08:01.223
Hello.

08:02.191 --> 08:03.793
I have your margaritas.

08:10.766 --> 08:12.068
Can I take
these empty bottles?

08:12.101 --> 08:13.102
Sure.

08:15.771 --> 08:17.306
- Thank you.
- It's a pleasure.

08:21.644 --> 08:22.812
Mm.

08:23.212 --> 08:24.647
It's strong.

09:03.252 --> 09:04.353
What are you doing?

09:08.891 --> 09:10.960
You are such an asshole.

09:10.993 --> 09:12.094
There's nothing in it.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.376
Hello, Mum.

09:27.409 --> 09:28.944
Hi.

09:28.978 --> 09:30.980
Yes! Wait, wait, wait...

09:31.013 --> 09:33.048
I can't hear you. Hello?

09:34.884 --> 09:35.951
What?

09:36.318 --> 09:37.653
Richard?

09:40.022 --> 09:42.091
Where... where are you?

09:48.797 --> 09:51.333
Um... Okay.

09:51.367 --> 09:52.368
Uh...

09:53.736 --> 09:55.371
We... We'll be there
as soon as...

09:55.404 --> 09:56.438
Mum?

09:56.472 --> 09:58.140
We'll be there
as soon as we can.

09:59.308 --> 10:00.442
Mum?

10:01.911 --> 10:03.779
- What's going on?
- Uh, it's Mum.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.748
They're taking her
to a hospital.

10:09.451 --> 10:11.153
Uh, start packing.

10:12.955 --> 10:15.024
Mum!

10:15.057 --> 10:17.092
- Come on, Mum.
- What's going on?

10:17.126 --> 10:19.094
- Start packing!
- Just start packing, Colin.

10:19.128 --> 10:20.162
Be quick.

10:55.064 --> 10:57.800
Your suitcases
are in the back.

10:57.833 --> 10:58.901
Bye, sir.

11:19.121 --> 11:21.223
Hello? Can you hear me?

11:23.392 --> 11:24.460
What?

11:26.228 --> 11:27.263
What?

11:37.206 --> 11:38.274
Hey.

11:40.009 --> 11:41.410
Yeah.

11:41.443 --> 11:43.512
So, what's happened?

11:45.848 --> 11:46.915
I see.

11:49.952 --> 11:51.487
All right.

11:52.622 --> 11:54.890
No, I understand.
I understand.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.058
Is she dead?

12:18.514 --> 12:20.182
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

12:20.215 --> 12:22.484
Sir, we have sorted out
your flights.

12:22.518 --> 12:24.953
Unfortunately,
we couldn't avoid a layover

12:24.987 --> 12:27.156
in Mexico City
and then one in Madrid.

12:27.189 --> 12:29.124
Thankfully,
it's only one in Mexico.

12:29.158 --> 12:31.126
And only two hours in Madrid.

12:33.329 --> 12:34.930
We need your passports.

12:36.565 --> 12:37.566
Thank you.

12:39.401 --> 12:41.303
Can I have your
passports, please?

12:42.571 --> 12:43.606
Thank you.

12:46.008 --> 12:47.109
Thank you.

12:49.244 --> 12:50.580
Have you given them
your passport?

12:50.613 --> 12:51.880
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12:53.282 --> 12:55.417
- I don't have my passport.
- Mum...

12:55.451 --> 12:56.552
You don't have
your passport?

12:56.586 --> 12:58.454
- Sir, I need your passport.
- I don't have my passport.

12:58.487 --> 12:59.488
Where is it?

12:59.521 --> 13:02.991
We're already boarding.
We need your passport.

13:03.025 --> 13:04.594
- What did you say?
- I don't have my passport.

13:04.627 --> 13:07.329
- What the fuck? You don't...
- What?

13:07.363 --> 13:09.331
I left it at the hotel. Um...

13:09.365 --> 13:11.100
Okay, we can put you
on the next flight.

13:11.133 --> 13:12.901
- Thank you.
- No, no, no! We'll wait!

13:12.935 --> 13:14.970
- We have to go now.
- We will wait! No!

13:15.003 --> 13:16.905
The plane is already
boarding, okay?

13:16.939 --> 13:19.108
- I can't believe it!
- Mum...

13:21.110 --> 13:22.344
Get her on the plane.

13:22.378 --> 13:23.646
We need
to pass security.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.080
Mum, come on.

13:25.114 --> 13:26.548
How can you leave
your passport?

13:28.651 --> 13:29.652
Come on.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.688
Fuck!

13:31.721 --> 13:33.956
We will follow
your luggage, okay?

13:33.989 --> 13:35.157
We will wait for you.

13:36.492 --> 13:37.627
Come this way.

14:22.271 --> 14:23.338
Taxi?

14:45.327 --> 14:46.428
Hotel.

14:46.462 --> 14:47.664
What hotel?

14:48.798 --> 14:50.499
- Hotel.
- Whatever?

14:51.734 --> 14:52.968
Okay.

14:57.139 --> 14:59.241
Hotel, very, very good.

15:23.098 --> 15:24.566
You like <i>chicas?</i>

15:26.301 --> 15:28.136
Table dance.

15:28.170 --> 15:31.006
Look at it.
This is a beautiful girl.

16:10.580 --> 16:12.180
Hold on just a second.

16:13.315 --> 16:14.516
Luisa!

16:28.665 --> 16:30.432
Can I have a room, please?

16:30.465 --> 16:31.668
Yes.

16:31.701 --> 16:33.836
Hold on.
You first see the room.

16:34.804 --> 16:36.806
- Want to show you?
- Okay.

17:20.950 --> 17:22.150
Okay.

17:28.423 --> 17:30.760
- How much?
- Four hundred pesos.

17:32.662 --> 17:33.830
Thank you.

17:44.774 --> 17:45.775
Okay.

17:49.679 --> 17:53.548
<i>Amigo,</i>
if you need anything, you call me.

17:53.583 --> 17:55.250
This is my phone number.

17:55.283 --> 17:56.786
- Okay.
- Okay?

17:56.819 --> 17:58.320
- <i>Gracias.</i>
- Thank you.

19:39.421 --> 19:40.623
- Fine.
- Okay.

19:40.656 --> 19:42.992
- You're only going to pay for what you drink, okay?
- Okay.

19:43.025 --> 19:44.694
Anything else you need,
let me know.

19:44.727 --> 19:45.895
Okay, thank you.

20:22.364 --> 20:23.733
Hang on, hang on.

20:24.600 --> 20:25.668
Hang on.

20:26.568 --> 20:28.638
Hi, how are you?

20:30.539 --> 20:31.707
Yeah.

20:34.376 --> 20:36.779
No, I'm...
No, I looked in the safe.

20:36.813 --> 20:39.414
We looked in the safe. We...

20:39.447 --> 20:41.717
It's not there. I thought
it was there, it's not there.

20:42.785 --> 20:44.921
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:46.689 --> 20:48.791
No, they're still looking.
They're still looking.

20:48.825 --> 20:51.359
We're still looking. Yeah.

21:43.646 --> 21:46.082
No, I... I'm...

21:46.115 --> 21:49.652
I have to fix this
at the consulate and, um...

21:50.653 --> 21:52.722
It's closed till Monday, so...

21:53.055 --> 21:54.489
I'm sorry.

21:54.522 --> 21:57.126
It's the best I could do.

21:57.159 --> 21:59.795
<i>If they give
you a new passport on Monday,</i>

21:59.829 --> 22:01.898
<i>you could fly back
straight away.</i>

22:01.931 --> 22:04.000
- Yeah.
- <i>You could arrive on Tuesday,</i>

22:04.033 --> 22:07.435
<i>and we could have, uh,
the funeral on Wednesday.</i>

22:07.469 --> 22:09.872
Yeah, yeah. Hopefully, yeah.

22:09.906 --> 22:13.809
<i>Or maybe you could get an emergency
permit to fly, something like that.</i>

22:14.677 --> 22:16.045
Yeah, well, I'll try my best.

22:16.078 --> 22:19.547
<i>I'm going to have Richard
e-mail the death certificate.</i>

22:19.582 --> 22:21.217
<i>Get things going, you know?</i>

22:21.250 --> 22:22.852
Okay, yeah.

22:23.619 --> 22:24.887
<i>Where are you?</i>

22:24.921 --> 22:27.924
Um, I'm at a hotel
by the consulate.

22:27.957 --> 22:29.457
<i>How safe is it there?</i>

22:29.491 --> 22:30.726
Oh, it's fine, don't worry.

22:31.093 --> 22:32.094
Yeah.

22:33.029 --> 22:34.462
<i>Hang in there.</i>

22:35.831 --> 22:36.966
I will.

22:39.035 --> 22:40.670
How are you and the kids?

22:41.003 --> 22:42.537
<i>Uh...</i>

22:42.570 --> 22:44.941
<i>We just can't believe
she's gone.</i>

22:44.974 --> 22:47.944
Yeah, no, I know. I know.
Nor can I.

22:47.977 --> 22:50.646
<i>Right.
We're on the next flight.</i>

22:51.714 --> 22:52.748
Okay.

22:53.215 --> 22:54.617
<i>Bye.</i>

22:54.650 --> 22:55.718
Bye, love.

24:02.685 --> 24:04.552
Hi, Neil. How you doing?

24:05.254 --> 24:06.689
Everything good?

24:11.594 --> 24:13.763
Hey, what's up?

24:13.796 --> 24:15.064
My friend.
My friend.

24:15.097 --> 24:16.165
Hi.

24:17.633 --> 24:18.634
Oh, man...

24:19.702 --> 24:21.971
- Your hotel very good?
- Yeah.

24:22.805 --> 24:24.106
- You like there?
- Yes.

24:24.140 --> 24:25.141
Okay.

24:26.842 --> 24:28.944
All right. It's...

24:29.912 --> 24:31.213
a nice day, right?

25:06.682 --> 25:07.683
Hmm?

25:09.718 --> 25:10.719
Uh...

25:11.420 --> 25:12.621
No.

25:14.790 --> 25:16.225
You want me to open?

25:16.258 --> 25:17.927
- Okay.
- Yeah.

25:19.762 --> 25:20.830
Thank you.

25:21.764 --> 25:23.999
- <i>Aqui.</i>
- <i>Gracias.</i>

25:29.071 --> 25:31.273
- Vacation?
- Mm-hmm.

25:32.441 --> 25:33.742
Yes.

25:36.278 --> 25:38.314
Where are you...
where are you from?

25:38.948 --> 25:40.015
London.

25:41.150 --> 25:42.351
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

25:45.054 --> 25:46.055
Mm.

25:47.223 --> 25:48.390
Berenice.

25:49.391 --> 25:50.860
Is where you're from?

25:54.897 --> 25:56.966
Okay. Neil.

26:03.906 --> 26:05.174
She's Jenny.

26:09.278 --> 26:12.047
- You want to see?
- Yeah.

26:34.336 --> 26:35.971
<i>I'm with Richard,</i>

26:36.005 --> 26:38.307
<i>going through
the funeral arrangements.</i>

26:41.043 --> 26:45.347
<i>Richard is going to send you the death
certificate and other documents...</i>

26:46.916 --> 26:49.051
<i>to take them to the consulate.</i>

26:49.084 --> 26:53.322
<i>And if they don't attend to
you, then just give him a call.</i>

26:57.960 --> 27:00.796
<i>I need you to help me
make some decisions.</i>

28:08.030 --> 28:09.465
Sorry.

28:10.899 --> 28:12.835
- My friend...
- No, it's fine.

28:14.203 --> 28:16.338
- Drunk.
- You wanna sit?

28:18.307 --> 28:19.975
- Yeah.
- Okay.

29:38.087 --> 29:39.221
Hello.

29:41.323 --> 29:42.424
Hi.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.095
Hi, sweetheart.

29:50.132 --> 29:53.035
No, no, no, I'm just grabbing
a quick bite, but, um...

29:54.637 --> 29:56.138
I know it's urgent.

29:56.171 --> 29:59.241
I'm... just
by the consulate, but...

30:01.043 --> 30:02.344
Yeah, I'll be...

30:03.379 --> 30:07.249
I'll be... there
as soon as possible.

30:07.282 --> 30:09.084
I know, and I do.

30:09.118 --> 30:11.220
I wanna come home, too,
of course I do, but...

30:16.125 --> 30:17.459
She told you that?

30:22.231 --> 30:24.333
She told you
she wanted to be cremated?

30:27.102 --> 30:29.972
Well, they're not family, so,
it's got nothing to do with them.

30:30.005 --> 30:32.541
So, whatever you choose to
do, I'm with you.

30:34.176 --> 30:35.377
Whatever you feel.

30:36.378 --> 30:37.446
Yup.

30:38.414 --> 30:39.616
Absolutely.

30:41.651 --> 30:43.152
You sound awful.

30:47.322 --> 30:51.093
- <i>Salud! Salud! Salud!</i>
- Cheers.

32:12.809 --> 32:14.309
<i>What's going on?</i>

32:16.679 --> 32:19.314
<i>Could you answer
the fucking phone?</i>

33:01.256 --> 33:02.491
I need you.

33:13.235 --> 33:14.737
Where's my stuff?

33:16.839 --> 33:18.206
Where's my...

33:28.216 --> 33:30.118
I don't know.

35:56.899 --> 35:59.969
So, you should go there.
You should go to Paris.

36:00.002 --> 36:03.538
- Mm-hmm.
- Go to London, where I'm from.

36:03.572 --> 36:05.808
Uh, Rome. Beautiful!

36:06.441 --> 36:07.944
Rome.

36:07.977 --> 36:09.946
Uh, yeah,
you should go there.

36:09.979 --> 36:11.948
Mm-hmm. Mm...

36:20.857 --> 36:24.426
You...
no woman?

36:24.459 --> 36:25.595
No.

36:25.628 --> 36:26.729
- Wife?
- No.

36:27.764 --> 36:29.799
You? Do you have a partner?

36:29.832 --> 36:31.433
Do you have a husband?

36:31.968 --> 36:33.035
- No.
- No?

36:33.069 --> 36:34.804
- No, no. No husband.
- Mm-hmm.

36:36.038 --> 36:37.572
Do you have children?

36:37.607 --> 36:39.876
No, no children!

36:39.909 --> 36:40.943
Okay.

36:40.977 --> 36:42.410
- You?
- No.

36:42.444 --> 36:43.913
I have, uh, a niece.

36:44.747 --> 36:46.649
And, uh, my sister's children.

36:46.682 --> 36:49.085
My sister has a niece
and a nephew.

36:49.118 --> 36:51.053
That's what we call...
we call...

36:51.754 --> 36:53.355
And I love them.

36:53.388 --> 36:54.957
I love them very, very much.

36:54.991 --> 36:57.059
- But no, none.
- No.

37:16.378 --> 37:17.814
Okay.

37:17.847 --> 37:19.514
Bye-bye!
- Bye!

37:28.858 --> 37:30.392
- <i>Gracias.</i>
- <i>Gracias.</i>

38:12.567 --> 38:14.103
What the fuck
is going on?

38:16.672 --> 38:18.608
I've been calling and calling.

38:21.077 --> 38:23.045
I thought
you needed help. I...

38:24.881 --> 38:26.514
I was really worried.

38:29.719 --> 38:31.087
What are you doing?

38:33.890 --> 38:36.058
Do you realize
what I had to go through?

38:36.692 --> 38:37.927
The funeral...

38:39.161 --> 38:41.097
the people...

38:41.130 --> 38:42.932
and all that on my own!

38:44.600 --> 38:45.902
What are you doing?

38:47.203 --> 38:48.905
What are you doing?

40:10.286 --> 40:11.486
Hey.

40:16.292 --> 40:17.693
I'm sorry.

40:21.864 --> 40:24.033
I'm sorry.
Can I come and see you?

40:34.977 --> 40:37.279
- I'll wait here.
- Okay.

40:37.313 --> 40:39.015
- Welcome one more time.
- Thanks.

40:39.048 --> 40:40.649
- Can I have a buggy?
- Okay.

41:01.837 --> 41:03.239
- Alice Bennett.
- Okay.

41:07.777 --> 41:09.011
Okay, let's go.

41:53.289 --> 41:55.224
I thought
you weren't going to come.

41:56.892 --> 41:57.927
Why?

42:01.063 --> 42:04.633
For the same reason you left
me with all of our problems.

42:05.768 --> 42:07.770
The fact that
you've been hiding.

42:10.139 --> 42:11.340
I'm not hiding.

42:18.814 --> 42:21.717
You never came back
for your passport.

42:21.750 --> 42:23.819
You never went
to the consulate.

42:25.254 --> 42:27.223
Did you even lose
your passport?

42:28.090 --> 42:29.158
Mm-mm.

42:40.035 --> 42:41.637
What do you want?

42:43.105 --> 42:44.740
Do you want...

42:44.773 --> 42:46.175
do you want our money?

42:46.976 --> 42:49.078
Do you want my money?

42:49.111 --> 42:50.913
Is that why
you're doing this?

42:52.081 --> 42:53.182
No.

43:04.360 --> 43:06.362
Then why are you
doing this?

43:14.737 --> 43:16.305
I'm not interested
in money.

43:24.280 --> 43:26.081
What's the matter
with you?

43:29.185 --> 43:30.286
Nothing.

43:34.123 --> 43:36.025
Don't you want to see
the children?

43:38.060 --> 43:39.795
Yeah, of course
I do. Yeah.

43:40.229 --> 43:41.363
When?

43:44.800 --> 43:45.935
I don't know.

43:47.503 --> 43:50.072
Well, then,
just come home!

43:58.380 --> 44:01.317
If you want me to give up
my share, I'll do it.

44:01.350 --> 44:03.986
Just have Richard sign...

44:04.954 --> 44:06.922
Send the papers,
I'll sign them.

44:06.956 --> 44:08.390
I'll sign anything.

44:12.361 --> 44:13.796
Okay?

44:39.521 --> 44:42.157
Yes, Richard? Um...

45:02.612 --> 45:06.548
Richard says that, um,
if you're willing to sign,

45:08.150 --> 45:11.887
he can be here,
prepare the paperwork and come.

45:11.920 --> 45:12.921
Okay.

45:13.956 --> 45:15.391
- Okay.
- Okay.

45:30.406 --> 45:31.473
Shall we have dinner?

45:33.342 --> 45:34.410
What?

45:35.878 --> 45:36.979
Are you hungry?

45:37.913 --> 45:39.114
Just fuck off!

46:09.411 --> 46:10.546
<i>Hi, Richard.</i>

46:11.480 --> 46:13.616
No, I'm... I'm fine.

46:14.183 --> 46:15.317
Go ahead.

46:18.454 --> 46:19.988
When's the reading?

46:22.458 --> 46:24.193
Okay, well, um...

46:24.226 --> 46:27.563
You're representing me,
you'll be there for me, I'm...

46:27.597 --> 46:29.565
I'm not interested
in the money, Richard.

46:29.599 --> 46:30.899
The money is hers.

46:31.533 --> 46:32.568
Yeah.

46:33.369 --> 46:34.503
No, I...

46:35.304 --> 46:37.206
I know, but it's... it's...

46:39.074 --> 46:41.410
The business is hers,
she's always...

46:41.443 --> 46:43.145
she's always run the business.

46:43.178 --> 46:45.547
It's for her to...
her to decide.

47:50.680 --> 47:52.682
- You wait here?
- Okay, Neil.

48:14.671 --> 48:17.239
- Hi, Richard.
- Good to see you.

48:17.272 --> 48:18.373
How are you?

48:18.407 --> 48:20.242
I'm good.
How are you?

48:20.275 --> 48:21.510
I'm fine.

48:21.543 --> 48:23.378
- Thanks for coming.
- Shall we sign?

48:26.148 --> 48:28.685
We have to be at the airport
in 40 minutes.

48:34.389 --> 48:35.592
You leave today?

48:38.427 --> 48:40.496
I thought you'd be with us
two weeks ago.

48:44.099 --> 48:45.167
Neil...

48:46.803 --> 48:49.505
you do realize
that in signing this,

48:49.538 --> 48:51.641
you are relinquishing
everything.

48:56.278 --> 49:01.216
Your sister is granting you
a monthly stipend,

49:01.250 --> 49:07.256
but it's on condition that you maintain
monthly contact with the family, through me.

49:13.161 --> 49:14.396
All right, so...

49:17.399 --> 49:20.102
What sum should I write in?

49:26.542 --> 49:28.377
Ten thousand a month?

49:29.444 --> 49:32.247
He'll live nicely on that
in Acapulco.

49:37.219 --> 49:38.353
Ten thousand.

49:50.867 --> 49:52.802
Will you come back
with us?

49:59.308 --> 50:00.677
May I sign?

50:02.311 --> 50:04.246
Yes. Here.

50:06.616 --> 50:08.517
And there.

50:15.223 --> 50:16.726
Uh, I'll wait
in the van.

50:30.305 --> 50:31.440
Thanks, Richard.

50:33.743 --> 50:34.811
There.

50:41.818 --> 50:42.885
And here.

52:39.501 --> 52:41.369
Call an ambulance!

52:46.809 --> 52:51.714
Remember the guy
who came to get beers?

52:51.748 --> 52:54.516
We went
to eat something afterwards.

54:39.689 --> 54:41.757
Albert Thompson
from the consulate.

54:42.557 --> 54:43.558
Okay.

54:44.126 --> 54:45.595
Where's Berenice?

54:46.162 --> 54:47.495
I'm not sure.

54:50.099 --> 54:51.767
Why am I here?

54:51.801 --> 54:52.935
Oh, um...

54:53.836 --> 54:55.137
- You don't know?
- No.

55:02.078 --> 55:04.013
"Today, the British Embassy
in Mexico confirmed

55:04.046 --> 55:05.815
"the crude assassination
of Alice Bennett,

55:05.848 --> 55:07.950
"heiress of the multi-billion
pound swine production

55:07.984 --> 55:09.886
"and slaughterhouse business
in the U.K.,

55:09.919 --> 55:13.089
"who was killed in a kidnapping
attempt in Acapulco, Mexico.

55:13.122 --> 55:16.959
"Brother, Neil Bennett, was seen
on numerous occasions with killers,

55:16.993 --> 55:19.427
"Guerrero and Anderson,
found at the scene.

55:19.461 --> 55:22.665
"But their getaway driver, Jorge
Saldana, better known as Jorge Campos,

55:22.698 --> 55:25.400
"was located several hours
later by authorities."

55:30.505 --> 55:32.174
Where's Richard?

55:32.208 --> 55:33.709
Heard they
wouldn't let him in.

55:37.046 --> 55:39.715
My sister has children...

55:39.749 --> 55:42.151
Richard has spoken to them,
but I'm not sure that...

55:43.986 --> 55:46.122
I saw the documents
that you signed.

55:46.155 --> 55:49.091
The ones leaving your share of
the inheritance to your sister.

55:49.125 --> 55:52.028
You two being the sole heirs of the
fortune made from the slaughterhouses

55:52.061 --> 55:53.796
and the pig production
businesses...

55:54.830 --> 55:56.966
- and the...
- I need to talk to Richard.

55:56.999 --> 55:59.068
- He's looking for a lawyer.
- He's a fucking lawyer!

55:59.101 --> 56:00.636
A Mexican lawyer.

56:05.741 --> 56:07.743
Why didn't you go home
for your mother's funeral?

56:14.050 --> 56:16.719
The embassy has requested you
are placed in your own cell,

56:16.752 --> 56:18.821
and they are requesting the
presence of a legal team in London

56:18.854 --> 56:20.156
in order
to get you out of here.

57:48.911 --> 57:50.246
How long are you staying?

57:51.347 --> 57:53.616
Until you're released.

57:53.649 --> 57:56.185
We've got a very good lawyer
coming from Mexico City.

57:59.188 --> 58:00.589
How are they doing?

58:03.159 --> 58:04.860
Colin's very perturbed.

58:06.095 --> 58:08.330
Alexa won't answer my calls.

58:11.267 --> 58:13.035
It's very messy, Neil.

01:00:19.995 --> 01:00:21.764
Why were you staying
at that hotel?

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.368
Were you involved
with anything? I mean...

01:00:28.237 --> 01:00:30.239
Excuse me. Will you
just give us a minute?

01:00:34.043 --> 01:00:35.377
I've actually been
instructed by the consulate

01:00:35.411 --> 01:00:37.813
not to leave
you two alone, sir.

01:00:37.846 --> 01:00:39.448
I'll be leaving with you
in a minute.

01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:42.851
I'll see you outside.

01:01:03.872 --> 01:01:05.207
How are you feeling?

01:01:09.111 --> 01:01:11.180
If... if we explain...

01:01:13.015 --> 01:01:14.283
your condition...

01:01:30.833 --> 01:01:33.369
How are they?
How are they really?

01:01:35.137 --> 01:01:36.272
<i>Gracias.</i>

01:01:42.612 --> 01:01:45.547
No. Tell me when.

01:01:45.582 --> 01:01:47.916
Oh, hang on, hang on.

01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:49.385
Hang on.

01:02:17.279 --> 01:02:18.480
To the airport.

01:02:28.257 --> 01:02:29.425
Thank you.

01:02:37.066 --> 01:02:38.601
Will you take me
to the hotel?

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.835
<i>Hola.</i>

01:04:37.754 --> 01:04:39.455
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:04:42.759 --> 01:04:44.326
The kids are here.

01:04:46.462 --> 01:04:48.030
They need to talk to you.

01:05:13.222 --> 01:05:15.257
What the fuck?

01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:17.159
I'm sorry, love.

01:05:17.192 --> 01:05:19.127
- It's okay.
- You're not sorry!

01:05:19.161 --> 01:05:20.763
You're not...

01:05:20.797 --> 01:05:22.231
What the fuck!

01:05:22.264 --> 01:05:23.766
Wait! Just wait there!
Get out...

01:05:27.536 --> 01:05:29.104
Neil?

01:05:29.137 --> 01:05:30.405
Just go. Go, go, go.

01:05:33.108 --> 01:05:34.611
Go. Go to them. Go.

01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:42.685
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:05:42.719 --> 01:05:44.621
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yes?

01:06:34.536 --> 01:06:35.605
Hi.

01:06:54.156 --> 01:06:56.626
The family business
will become yours...

01:06:58.393 --> 01:07:00.228
Colin and Alexa.

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:06.669
All of the banking,
the properties...

01:07:08.503 --> 01:07:12.675
the business outlets,
the farms, everything.

01:07:14.911 --> 01:07:19.181
Neil will continue to receive
his lifetime pension...

01:07:21.618 --> 01:07:23.620
which your mother
had agreed to.

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:30.425
He will also receive £100,000
as a down payment.

01:07:33.195 --> 01:07:37.566
And his health insurance
will be paid for his lifetime.

01:07:54.449 --> 01:07:55.652
Can we sign?

01:07:56.551 --> 01:07:57.754
Yes.

01:07:57.787 --> 01:07:59.822
Just sign
and then just pass it.

01:08:51.439 --> 01:08:52.608
Are we done?

01:08:53.643 --> 01:08:54.810
Wait a moment.

01:09:00.582 --> 01:09:01.651
We're done.

01:09:03.618 --> 01:09:04.787
Come on, Alexa.

01:11:00.670 --> 01:11:04.339
Neil? Hey! Hey! Neil?

01:11:52.855 --> 01:11:55.423
Neil?

01:11:55.457 --> 01:11:59.494
We want to transfer you to Oncology
Center in Mexico City, okay?

01:12:00.763 --> 01:12:01.998
Excuse me.

01:12:53.249 --> 01:12:54.884
<i>I compared
your medical records</i>

01:12:54.917 --> 01:12:56.786
<i>that your insurance company
sent to us</i>

01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:59.487
with the test
that we just ran.

01:13:02.792 --> 01:13:04.927
The cancer
had already metastasized.

01:13:06.629 --> 01:13:09.231
