Excuse me.
Can I get a comment, please?

00:18.322 --> 00:21.369
Yes, ma'am,
keep it right back here.

00:26.722 --> 00:29.246

- Agent Lisbon.

Don't think
we'll be needing you guys.

who found the body.'

00:33.294 --> 00:36.036
- Did he confess?
- Ah, he's a real squirrel.

00:36.123 --> 00:38.081
- Did you kill her?
- Did you kill her?

like to ask you that..'

Hello, Mrs. Tolliver.

02:42.074 --> 02:43.728
Who are you?

02:43.815 --> 02:46.166
My name is Patrick Jane.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.994
I'm here to help you.

02:49.081 --> 02:50.996
Would you like a cup of tea?

02:53.347 --> 02:55.914
Yes, I would, thank you.

02:58.917 --> 03:00.310
You must be tired.

03:01.746 --> 03:03.357
Why don't you sit down?

03:05.620 --> 03:06.664
It's nice and quiet
in here, isn't it?

03:08.405 --> 03:10.625
Quiet, soothing, calm.

Calm.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.334
I've been watching you
and your husband

that I understand

03:26.206 --> 03:27.729
what you're feeling
right now.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.429
You have no idea.

03:34.866 --> 03:36.564
Believe me.

03:36.651 --> 03:37.913
I do.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.263
I know.

03:40.350 --> 03:41.569
I know,
and I wanna help you.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.875
You can't help me.

03:43.962 --> 03:46.138
You..
What do you know?

03:46.226 --> 03:48.228
[chuckles]
All sorts of things.

03:50.142 --> 03:52.928
You really only pretend
to like skiing, right?

03:53.015 --> 03:54.277
Yes, but--

03:54.364 --> 03:55.844
You're pleased
that your best friend

03:55.931 --> 03:58.629
recently gained some weight.
About 10 pounds.

03:58.716 --> 03:59.891
You wish you'd been
more adventurous

03:59.978 --> 04:01.328
when you were younger.

04:01.415 --> 04:03.330
You love India,
but you've never been there.

04:03.417 --> 04:06.376
You have trouble sleeping.
Your favorite color..

04:08.465 --> 04:10.859
...is blue.

04:10.946 --> 04:14.819
I don't understand.
You're..

04:14.906 --> 04:15.907
You're psychic?

04:15.994 --> 04:17.953
[chuckles]
No.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.303
Just paying attention.

04:20.390 --> 04:23.741
I used to make a good living
pretending to be a psychic.

04:25.308 --> 04:28.355
I tell you this because
I want you to understand

04:28.442 --> 04:30.922
there's no point
hiding things from me.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.579
Hiding...what?

04:35.666 --> 04:39.409
You know what I see
when I look at your husband?

04:39.496 --> 04:42.847
I see a warm, loving,
generous man.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.545
A little vain, maybe.

04:44.632 --> 04:46.590
Selfish, controlling..

04:46.677 --> 04:48.200
...but a decent man.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.289
Yes.

04:52.988 --> 04:55.425
So why do you suspect him
of murdering your daughter?

04:55.512 --> 04:58.385
[teacup rattling]

04:59.864 --> 05:01.126
I don't.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.566
- The McCluskey boy did it.
- Yes.

05:05.653 --> 05:08.046
That's what the police say.

05:08.133 --> 05:11.702
But you think
they're wrong. Why?

05:11.789 --> 05:13.965
I don't know.
I-I-I don't know.

05:14.052 --> 05:15.793
I..

05:15.880 --> 05:17.839
Tell me.

05:17.926 --> 05:19.580
Last year,

05:19.667 --> 05:23.061
they-they have been
so strange with each other.

05:23.148 --> 05:25.542
And neither one would admit
that anything was wrong

05:25.629 --> 05:29.198
and I think that..

05:29.285 --> 05:31.026
I think that she tried
to tell me once

05:31.113 --> 05:33.333
and I didn't..
I...

05:35.726 --> 05:37.511
God.

05:37.598 --> 05:39.251
Oh, God.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.992
Did you ask him
if he killed her?

05:41.079 --> 05:42.777
[sniffles]

05:42.864 --> 05:44.387
What would he say?

05:44.474 --> 05:47.085
Most wives can tell
when their husbands are lying.

05:49.479 --> 05:53.570
Yes. Yes. I..

05:53.657 --> 05:56.617
I don't want tea. I..
The McCluskey boy did it. I..

05:56.704 --> 05:57.792
Maybe.

05:59.663 --> 06:03.058
[whispers]
Oh.

06:03.145 --> 06:06.148
You think he did it, too?

[scoffs]

06:27.430 --> 06:28.910
How dare you?

06:28.997 --> 06:30.651
I asked you
a simple question, sir.

06:30.738 --> 06:33.567
Did you kill your daughter?

06:33.654 --> 06:34.959
- No.
- Oh!

06:35.046 --> 06:37.527
I did not kill my daughter!

06:37.614 --> 06:40.487
Now you get the hell
out of my house!

06:43.577 --> 06:45.883
June, what's the matter
with you?

06:48.059 --> 06:49.626
I'm gonna have your badge.

06:49.713 --> 06:52.673
An innocent man
would have punched me by now.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.849
I am gonna make life
miserable for you.

06:54.936 --> 06:57.504
You come in here,

suited you, Price.

What are you, on vacation?

08:46.613 --> 08:48.223
No, ma'am.
Won't do it again.

08:48.310 --> 08:50.225
When your trousseau arrives,
pick up the second rental

08:50.312 --> 08:52.227
and go direct
to the sheriff's department

08:52.314 --> 08:55.186

furniture and phone lines.

How was your flight?

09:10.941 --> 09:13.727
Go away.
You're on suspension.

Thank you.

Ends next week.

09:18.383 --> 09:19.863
So come back next week.

told him?

09:23.258 --> 09:25.216
- It was you, wasn't it, Cho?
- Yes, it was.

09:25.303 --> 09:27.218
Of course he called me.
It's Red John.

09:27.305 --> 09:30.091
You can't keep me out of this.
Why would you want to?

09:30.178 --> 09:32.006
You got a man killed.
There's consequences.

09:32.093 --> 09:33.529
Oh, a man
that murdered his daughter

09:33.616 --> 09:35.313
'cause she wouldn't have sex
with him anymore?

09:35.400 --> 09:37.489
You didn't know that.
You didnotknow that.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.969
If she hadn't had left
a diary--

09:39.056 --> 09:41.711
But she did, though.
Be reasonable. This is my case.

09:41.798 --> 09:44.148
- Your case?
- Red John's mine.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.194
Red john
doesn't belong to anyone.

09:46.281 --> 09:49.284

09:49.371 --> 09:50.981
He belongs to me.

09:51.068 --> 09:53.636
It's not my call.
Rules are rules.

09:53.723 --> 09:56.291
Come back next week.

but burn marks..'

Sorry I went over your head.
I'll redeem myself, I promise.

10:17.921 --> 10:19.967
You want redemption?
Be silent.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.751
- Okay. I can learn to do that.
- Shh!

10:24.667 --> 10:25.842
Sorry.

10:27.714 --> 10:30.412
The burn marks here
indicate that the victim

10:30.499 --> 10:32.327
'was subdued with a stun gun'

10:32.414 --> 10:34.634
'standard civilian model
by the look of it.'

10:34.721 --> 10:35.939
Death appears to be caused

10:36.026 --> 10:37.767
by several blows
to the back of the skull

10:37.854 --> 10:40.944
'consistent with a bloodied
golf club found at the scene.'

of the viscera.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.573
- Textbook Red John.
- Who found the bodies?

11:01.661 --> 11:03.750
This one's husband, coming home
from the airport Sunday morning

11:03.837 --> 11:05.708
'with his brother.
He's a pro golfer.'

11:05.795 --> 11:07.928
- Oh, yeah?
- Price Randolph.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.973
What's her deal with him?
Do we know?

11:10.060 --> 11:11.758
Uh, he's on file
as one of her physicians.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.498
- Making a house call?
- Lovers?

11:13.585 --> 11:15.675
No, this one's gay.

11:17.938 --> 11:20.854
Dr. Wagner might know
what their relationship was.

11:20.941 --> 11:23.683
He's here
to make the formal I.D.?

11:23.770 --> 11:25.423
Okay.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.991
Dr. Wagner.

11:28.078 --> 11:30.211
Hi.

11:30.298 --> 11:31.734
I'm Agent Teresa Lisbon

11:31.821 --> 11:33.954

of investigation.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.651
What's your connection
to the victims?

11:35.738 --> 11:37.087
I work with Gregory.

11:37.174 --> 11:39.655
Dr. Tannen and-and
the Randolph family

11:39.742 --> 11:41.744
are longtime clients
of our practice.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.790
Are house calls the norm
at your practice?

11:43.877 --> 11:46.880
No. Gregory and Alison
were close friends.

11:46.967 --> 11:49.447
- Lovers?
- No. He was gay.

11:49.534 --> 11:52.929
No, they were just...
friends.

11:53.016 --> 11:54.931
What in God's name
happened to them?

11:55.018 --> 11:56.454
Looks like Red John.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.501
Who's Red John?

11:59.588 --> 12:01.677
We don't know who did this.

12:01.764 --> 12:04.767
We'll be in touch probably.
Thank you.

12:11.078 --> 12:13.471
- 'Set up right here?'
- 'Yeah, that's good.'

12:13.558 --> 12:15.909
Red John enters here.

12:15.996 --> 12:17.867
Excuse me. Sorry.

12:17.954 --> 12:20.261
He comes around here.

12:20.348 --> 12:22.829
'He waits for her..'

12:22.916 --> 12:24.874
'...expecting her
to come in alone.'

Only thing, her friend Tannen
Chose the wrong night

12:27.747 --> 12:30.010
to come over for a Richard Gere
and ice cream orgy.

12:31.881 --> 12:35.755
So Red John zaps 'em both
with his trusty stun gun

12:35.842 --> 12:36.799
and...

12:36.886 --> 12:38.496
...excuse me.

12:38.583 --> 12:41.717

from the bag here and..

12:41.804 --> 12:43.414
Bam!

12:46.069 --> 12:47.679
Crushes Tannen's skull.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.290
'Then he takes his sweet time'

12:49.377 --> 12:52.119
'dealing with Alison
how he likes.'

12:52.206 --> 12:55.775
She's a nice big girl,
so unless he's pretty strong

12:55.862 --> 12:57.994
'I'm guessing that he grabbed
her by the arms and...'

13:37.251 --> 13:39.383
He says he's sorry
for all the pain

13:39.470 --> 13:41.472
he's caused you
and your mother.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.432
Deeply sorry.

13:44.519 --> 13:45.737
[woman sniffles]

13:45.825 --> 13:48.523
He asks you to forgive him.

13:48.610 --> 13:50.568
Can you do that, Jenny?

13:50.655 --> 13:52.353
[crying]
Mm-hmm.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.964
- He needs to hear it.
- I forgive you, daddy.

13:55.051 --> 13:56.357
- Oh, yes.
- Daddy, I forgive you.

13:56.444 --> 13:57.837
[cries]

13:57.924 --> 13:59.229
He's smiling now.

13:59.316 --> 14:00.491
[laughs]

14:00.578 --> 14:01.753
They're tears of joy.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.886
[cries]

14:03.973 --> 14:06.236
He says, "God bless you
and keep you."

14:06.323 --> 14:07.716
[continues crying]

14:12.025 --> 14:13.765
He's gone.

14:25.081 --> 14:27.605
Amazing. Amazing. Amazing.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.346
She's...amazed.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.566
[laughter]

14:31.653 --> 14:33.655
- Patrick..
- One second.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.222
- Give him some time.
- Ab-absolu..

14:35.309 --> 14:36.701
Come on back to us.

14:36.788 --> 14:39.226
- I'm back. Thank you.
- He's back.

14:39.313 --> 14:42.925
So, Patrick, I understand
that you're also

14:43.012 --> 14:46.668
sort of a paranormal
detective. Is that right?

14:46.755 --> 14:48.888
I try to help the police
when I can.

14:48.975 --> 14:51.020
And-and you're
helping them hunt

14:51.107 --> 14:53.327
this scary serial killer.

14:53.414 --> 14:54.371
What's his name?

14:54.458 --> 14:55.938
- Red--
- Red john?

14:56.025 --> 15:00.160
- There she blows..
- Classic Red John smiley face.

15:00.247 --> 15:02.727
Drawn in the victims' blood

15:02.814 --> 15:06.775
clockwise with three fingers
of his right hand

15:06.862 --> 15:09.343
wearing a rubber
kitchen glove.

15:09.430 --> 15:12.041
I'm stoked to finally
see one in the flesh.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.477
This isn't Red John.

15:14.783 --> 15:16.654
Right.

15:16.741 --> 15:19.657
Red john thinks of himself
as a showman, an artist.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.485
'He has a strong sense
of theater.'

15:21.572 --> 15:23.226
In all the previous killings,
he made sure

15:23.313 --> 15:27.665
that the first thing that anyone
sees is the face on the wall.

15:27.752 --> 15:30.146
'You see the face first,
and you know..'

15:30.233 --> 15:32.714
'...you know what's happened,
and you feel dread.'

15:32.801 --> 15:35.586
Then and only then do you see
the body of the victim.

15:35.673 --> 15:37.240
'Always in that order.'

15:37.327 --> 15:38.938
Here it's the opposite.

15:39.025 --> 15:41.636
The first thing you see
is the body

15:41.723 --> 15:45.118
and you have to look around
to see the face on the wall.

15:45.205 --> 15:47.337
Doesn't play nearly
as well, does it?

15:47.424 --> 15:49.774
Depends on your taste,
I suppose.

15:49.861 --> 15:51.776
No, come on. The killer
could have painted

15:51.863 --> 15:53.343
on the correct wall here,

15:53.430 --> 15:55.041
but he didn't
because he didn't know better

15:55.128 --> 15:57.086
because he isn't Red John.

15:57.173 --> 16:01.134
Wow. It's interesting.

16:01.221 --> 16:02.787
[sighs deeply]

16:02.874 --> 16:05.399
You know what
your problem is, my friend?

16:05.486 --> 16:08.184
You enjoy your work a little
too much. You're a ghoul.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.666
If you don't get horny
reading "Fangoria"

16:11.753 --> 16:12.928
I'm Britney Spears.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.582
I-I resent that.

16:14.669 --> 16:16.540
This is you trying
to redeem yourself, is it?

16:16.627 --> 16:19.021
I'm sorry.

16:19.108 --> 16:21.284
He irks me.

16:21.371 --> 16:22.503
He's irksome.

16:24.505 --> 16:25.985
You don't need me here.

16:41.609 --> 16:44.525
So, yeah, this one
doesn't fit the pattern.

16:44.612 --> 16:46.179
So Jane was right.
We have a copycat.

16:46.266 --> 16:48.485
Or we have Red John
trying new things

16:48.572 --> 16:50.270
'or we have Red John
making a mistake.'

16:50.357 --> 16:53.969
We don't know. We'll work
the evidence until we do know.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.580
- Go talk to the husband.
- Will do, boss.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.152
What are you waitin' for?

17:20.865 --> 17:22.650
[dialing]

17:24.782 --> 17:27.524
Hey. So you might be right
about this case.

17:27.611 --> 17:29.483
Might be.
Thanks for the insight.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.052
No. Did I say that?

17:33.139 --> 17:36.707
I'm acknowledging the fact that
you might be right, that's all.

17:36.794 --> 17:38.144
I mean, if you wanted
to come back

17:38.231 --> 17:39.580
I couldn't stop you.

17:41.538 --> 17:44.150
Yeah, fine.
I'm asking you to come back.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.328
Because.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.286
Because you're useful
to the team.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.551
No. No, I won't say "please."
Go screw yourself.

17:54.638 --> 17:55.683
[beep]

17:55.770 --> 17:57.032
Jackass.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.391
[Jane]
'Good morning.'

18:08.478 --> 18:09.784
Can I help you?

18:11.525 --> 18:13.353
You must be Van Pelt.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.006
Pleasure. Patrick Jane.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.834
Oh, hi. Good to meet you.

18:16.921 --> 18:18.445
Agent Cho said
you had left town.

18:18.532 --> 18:21.100
No. Nowhere to go.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.058
Okay. Um..

18:23.145 --> 18:26.017
Do you want that desk
over there or this one?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.802
I mean,
that one gets more light.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.978
That one.
More light by all means.

18:30.065 --> 18:32.372
[chuckles]

18:32.459 --> 18:34.983
Very pleasant addition
to the serious crimes family.

18:35.070 --> 18:37.464
Oh. Hi.
When did you get here?

18:37.551 --> 18:41.032
Oh!Stop. I give up. Ooh!

18:41.120 --> 18:43.948
'Stop. Please, stop.
Turn off the camera.'

18:44.035 --> 18:45.254
'Come on, come on, come on.'

18:45.341 --> 18:47.343
'Okay, we're done, we're done.'

18:47.430 --> 18:49.650
'You are just awful!'

18:49.737 --> 18:51.130
Okay.
Go, go, go.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.958
'Stop, please. Stop!'

18:54.045 --> 18:55.612
[click]

18:58.441 --> 19:00.617
I lost a beautiful,
precious angel.

19:03.229 --> 19:04.752
Yes, sir.

19:04.839 --> 19:06.449
Good-looking woman.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.800
[clears throat]

19:09.887 --> 19:11.846
I'm jumping right in
if you don't mind, Price.

19:11.933 --> 19:14.153
'You missed the tournament
cut on Friday, yes?'

19:14.240 --> 19:15.850
'But you didn't come home
until Sunday.'

19:15.937 --> 19:17.939
What did you do with the rest
of your time in Fresno?

19:18.026 --> 19:20.289
I get this. You-you guys can't
catch the real killer

19:20.376 --> 19:22.291
so you wanna
lay this one on me?

19:22.378 --> 19:24.424
No, sir. If we have that
confirmation of where you were

19:24.511 --> 19:26.861
it lets us exclude you
from the investigation.

19:36.436 --> 19:39.700
[chuckles]
I was with a massage therapist.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.963
Name?

19:42.050 --> 19:46.750
Uh...it had "lady"
in there somewhere.

19:46.837 --> 19:48.796
It'll be
on his credit card bill.

19:48.883 --> 19:50.406
'There you go.'

19:50.493 --> 19:51.799
Pleasure meeting you boys.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.197
[Wagner]
'We're a full-service
private practice.'

19:58.284 --> 20:00.721
'We deliver primary care'

20:00.808 --> 20:02.853
'uh, cosmetic surgery'

20:02.940 --> 20:05.769
psychotherapy, sports medicine..
You name it.

20:05.856 --> 20:07.423
What's the African connection?

20:07.510 --> 20:09.730
It's what
this place is all about.

20:09.817 --> 20:12.080
Half our profits
go to build and staff

20:12.167 --> 20:15.779
basic health clinics
in poor African communities.

20:15.866 --> 20:17.346
Ah, here we are.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.609
[sighs]

20:19.696 --> 20:22.003
'It's a thin file.'

20:22.090 --> 20:24.701
'Alison was
a healthy young woman.'

20:24.788 --> 20:26.703
Psychiatric history?

20:26.790 --> 20:28.488
She didn't have one.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.490
[Lisbon]
'STDS? Abortions?'

20:30.577 --> 20:32.405
'Unexplained injuries?'

20:32.492 --> 20:35.103
[Wagner]
'No. Except for some
routine checkups with me'

20:35.190 --> 20:37.497
'it's all Dr. Tannen.
All aesthetic work.'

20:37.584 --> 20:39.281
Did Tannen keep a diary?

20:39.368 --> 20:43.024
Our last case was solved
because the victim kept a diary.

20:43.111 --> 20:45.200
Diary? I don't think so.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.158
Getting back
to Alison Randolph...

20:47.246 --> 20:50.292
'how was her marriage,
do you think?'

20:50.379 --> 20:52.338
Happy? Unhappy?

20:52.425 --> 20:54.209
About six months ago

20:54.296 --> 20:57.734
Dr. Tannen asked my advice.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.214
'Alison had asked him
to get her'

20:59.301 --> 21:01.085
a year's supply
of birth control pills

21:01.172 --> 21:04.524
off the books, which is
strictly against AMA Code.

21:04.611 --> 21:07.918
'I said sure, do it.'

21:08.005 --> 21:12.662
'I mean, better us
than some Tijuana drugstore.

21:12.749 --> 21:14.838
Why the secrecy?

21:14.925 --> 21:18.755
Price Randolph had
a vasectomy, April of '02.

21:18.842 --> 21:20.061
[chuckles]

21:20.148 --> 21:22.193
If there's anything else
I can do...

21:22.281 --> 21:23.586
I appreciate that.

21:25.588 --> 21:27.677
Actually, there is. Uh..

21:27.764 --> 21:30.114
I'm out of sleeping pills.

21:30.201 --> 21:32.595
Can you fix me up?
Anything strong will do.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.989
Sure. Uh, come in
for a consultation.

21:35.076 --> 21:36.556
We'll squeeze you in
this afternoon.

21:36.643 --> 21:39.210
Oh, no. I-I was hoping
to get something now.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.169
Trying to avoid the chitchat.

21:41.256 --> 21:42.953
I'm sorry.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.347
I wouldn't feel
comfortable prescribing

21:45.434 --> 21:47.871
without some sort
of "chitchat."

21:47.958 --> 21:50.744
I understand.
Uh, no problem.

21:50.831 --> 21:52.267
I'll call you..

21:52.354 --> 21:53.660
...maybe.

21:56.184 --> 21:57.794
[Cho]
'I like the husband for it.'

21:57.881 --> 21:59.492
'He hires some hooker he knows
to create an alibi'

21:59.579 --> 22:02.016
flies home, fillets the spouse,
flies back again.

22:02.103 --> 22:05.367
The classic elaborate and clever
but ultimately stupid plan.

22:05.454 --> 22:07.369
Have you looked at
his PGA tournament record?

22:07.456 --> 22:09.415
It's not bad.
6 mil career earnings.

22:09.502 --> 22:11.721
Mm-hmm, for coming in
second and third.

22:11.808 --> 22:14.245
'You put him on the 18th tee
with a big one on the line'

22:14.333 --> 22:17.814
like night follows day,
he'll shank it. He's a Choker.

22:17.901 --> 22:19.947
He doesn't have the nerve
to kill his wife. Didn't do it.

22:20.034 --> 22:21.340
Mm.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.342
Are you suggesting
we drop a prime suspect

22:23.429 --> 22:24.995
'because he's never
won a major?'

22:25.082 --> 22:29.435
'Oh, no, no, no. I'm just
making idle conversation.'

22:29.522 --> 22:31.828
How'd you do that?

22:31.915 --> 22:33.656
Telekinesis.

22:33.743 --> 22:35.832
He blew on it.

22:37.530 --> 22:39.009
That is another way
to do it.

22:40.707 --> 22:42.622
Mr. Jane..

22:42.709 --> 22:45.451
...I have a question regarding
your previous career path.

22:45.538 --> 22:47.061
Fire away.

22:47.148 --> 22:50.194
When you met with other
psychics, real psychics

22:50.281 --> 22:52.849
could they tell
you were just pretending?

22:52.936 --> 22:54.982
There's no such thing
as real psychics.

22:55.069 --> 22:58.028
I beg to differ.
My cousin Yolanda is a psychic.

22:58.115 --> 23:00.683
Your cousin is deluded
or dishonest, or both.

23:00.770 --> 23:02.206
Hey. Steady.

23:02.293 --> 23:04.557
No, no, he's entitled
to his opinion.

23:04.644 --> 23:06.733
He's wrong, though.
She has power.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.169
Thank you.

23:08.256 --> 23:09.997
She can communicate
with the other side.

23:10.084 --> 23:11.520
I've seen her do it myself.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.479
She let you speak
with someone that's gone.

23:13.566 --> 23:15.350
Yes.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.744
Someone that you love
and still miss very much.

23:17.831 --> 23:19.267
Yes.

23:19.354 --> 23:22.052
You wanted her power
to be real, so it was.

23:22.139 --> 23:23.924
No.

23:24.011 --> 23:26.709
You're so sure you're right.
Science don't know everything.

23:26.796 --> 23:28.972
500 years ago, radio would've
seemed like magic.

23:29.059 --> 23:30.060
Exactly.

23:30.147 --> 23:31.845
500 years in the future,

23:31.932 --> 23:33.368
it could be totally normal to
communicate with the other side.

23:33.455 --> 23:37.807
- The "other side."
- Mm-hmm.

23:37.894 --> 23:40.506
Your father's
a football coach, yeah?

23:40.593 --> 23:42.508
How'd you know that?

23:42.595 --> 23:44.553
It's obvious
from your whole demeanor.

23:44.640 --> 23:48.731
My point is, didn't dad always
say life is like football?

23:48.818 --> 23:51.473
When that final whistle blows,
the game is over.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.954
Done. There is no more.

23:54.041 --> 23:57.087
There is no "other side."
this is it..

23:57.174 --> 23:59.568
Lobster and bread rolls
and nautical kitsch.

23:59.655 --> 24:02.397
And then...nothingness.

24:02.484 --> 24:04.443
You poor, sad man.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.836
The kingdom of God
is a real place.

24:06.923 --> 24:09.404
Okay, later tonight,

24:09.491 --> 24:12.363
when Rigsby asks you to
come back to his hotel room..

24:12.451 --> 24:14.540
[choking and coughing]

24:16.498 --> 24:18.935
- ...say yes.
- Excuse me?

24:19.022 --> 24:22.112
I know. You were planning on
refusing him very curtly.

24:22.199 --> 24:24.114
First week on the job,
you wanna set a tone.

24:24.201 --> 24:26.116
No monkey business.
But why not?

24:26.203 --> 24:28.118
Rigsby is an excellent lover,
I'm sure.

24:28.205 --> 24:29.250
[sighs]

24:29.337 --> 24:32.296
Tough but fair. Right?

24:32.383 --> 24:33.733
Right.

24:39.347 --> 24:42.481
The kingdom of God
is a real place, Mr. Jane

24:42.568 --> 24:45.396
and you have
an immortal soul.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.703
Oh, I do so hope
you're wrong.

24:51.751 --> 24:54.318
[elevator bell chimes]

24:54.405 --> 24:55.581
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

24:55.668 --> 24:56.930
Later, dude.

25:03.197 --> 25:04.633
[elevator bell dings]

25:04.720 --> 25:06.243
This is... me.

25:06.330 --> 25:07.810
[elevator bell chimes]

25:10.421 --> 25:13.207
Welcome to the unit,
Agent Van Pelt.

25:13.294 --> 25:16.253
Thank you, agent Rigsby.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.908
[male narrator on TV]
She explodes into action,

25:18.995 --> 25:22.564
reaching up
to 60 miles per hour.

25:22.651 --> 25:26.350
She easily outruns
her terrifying prey.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.772
[panting]

25:58.469 --> 25:59.906
Oh!

25:59.993 --> 26:02.125
[alarm blaring]

26:21.188 --> 26:22.885
"Greetings, old friend.
It's been a while.

26:22.972 --> 26:26.062
"I hope you are keeping well.
I am thriving and happy.

26:26.149 --> 26:29.936
"I have 12 wives now and will
soon begin courting number 13.

26:30.023 --> 26:32.329
"Why can't you catch me?

26:32.416 --> 26:35.506
"You must feel so powerless
and stupid and sad.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.117
"Oh, well.

26:37.204 --> 26:39.641
All the best. Red John."

26:41.164 --> 26:43.123
That sounds like
the real deal to me.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.733
Sounds like Red John.
It's not.

26:44.820 --> 26:47.083
Red John wouldn't risk capture
just to taunt me.

26:47.170 --> 26:49.216
So the real killer's
trying to throw us off-track?

26:49.303 --> 26:52.480
Cho, find out where Price
Randolph was a half an hour ago.

26:52.567 --> 26:54.830
'Rigsby, I want you to check
the hotel security cameras.'

26:54.917 --> 26:56.789
'Get those over to forensics.'

27:02.403 --> 27:03.709
You okay?

27:03.796 --> 27:05.972
Absolutely.

27:06.059 --> 27:07.538
Get some sleep.

27:15.024 --> 27:16.591
[door closes]

27:36.219 --> 27:38.047
[telephone rings]

27:38.134 --> 27:40.180
[ring]

27:40.267 --> 27:42.138
[ring]

27:42.225 --> 27:44.880
[ring]

27:44.967 --> 27:46.447
Hello?

27:46.534 --> 27:49.145
- Good morning.
- You didn't sleep, did you?

27:49.232 --> 27:50.886
[slurping]

27:54.194 --> 27:55.543
Hi. I-I'd like
to make an appointment

27:55.630 --> 27:57.676
with Dr. Wagner, please.
It's urgent.

27:57.763 --> 28:00.113
'Jane. Patrick Jane.'

28:00.200 --> 28:01.767
Yeah, I'll hold.

28:01.854 --> 28:03.769
Forensics maybe got a break.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.422
The blood on the cloth
in the envelope

28:05.509 --> 28:07.250
is Alison Randolph's.

28:07.337 --> 28:10.819
But they found a hair in there..
Doesn't belong to her or Tannen.

28:10.906 --> 28:13.474
Guess who
it doesbelong to.

28:13.561 --> 28:16.999
It's yours, Tag.
Amazing, huh?

28:20.829 --> 28:22.135
Science.

28:26.835 --> 28:28.576
This is insane.

28:28.663 --> 28:29.838
I didn't...

28:29.925 --> 28:31.884
'I didn't kill Alison.'

28:31.971 --> 28:33.624
[Cho]
'How do you explain
your hair in the envelope?'

28:33.712 --> 28:35.539
Either it was a mistake

28:35.626 --> 28:37.672
'or-or I'm being framed.'

28:37.759 --> 28:39.326
'Who would want to frame you?'

28:39.413 --> 28:41.154
'We don't want to, if that's
what you're thinking.'

28:41.241 --> 28:43.373
[whispers]
He and Alison were lovers.

28:43.460 --> 28:45.114
Who would want to
frame you, Tag?

28:46.681 --> 28:48.117
My brother.

28:48.204 --> 28:51.468
[Cho]
'Why would he want
to do that?'

28:51.555 --> 28:53.819
Alison and I were lovers.

28:55.864 --> 28:58.519
I think youarepsychic.
You're just afraid to admit it.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.434
Mm-hmm.

29:00.521 --> 29:02.349
So..

29:04.090 --> 29:05.265
[clears throat]

29:06.745 --> 29:08.181
So..

29:11.010 --> 29:12.838
Why is it
you can't sleep?

29:12.925 --> 29:14.361
Because I can't
get the good pills

29:14.448 --> 29:15.666
without talking to a doctor.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.668
Hmm.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.627
And you don't like
talking to doctors.

29:19.714 --> 29:20.976
Meh, you know,
they always wanna be

29:21.063 --> 29:23.718
the smartest person in the room,
don't they?

29:23.805 --> 29:25.894
When in fact that's me,
obviously.

29:29.898 --> 29:34.816
You protect your core self
very fiercely.

29:34.903 --> 29:36.992
What do you think
is the reason for that?

29:37.079 --> 29:39.125
[chuckles]

29:39.212 --> 29:43.520
You know, this is exactly
how I imagined it would be.

29:43.607 --> 29:45.609
You gonna ask me
about my mother?

29:45.696 --> 29:47.568
Do you want me
to ask you about your mother?

29:47.655 --> 29:48.917
I just wanna sleep.

29:50.614 --> 29:54.575
So what is it
that keeps you awake?

29:54.662 --> 29:56.751
[male #4]
'What's his name?
Red john?'

29:56.838 --> 29:58.579
That's right. Red John.

29:58.666 --> 30:02.235
Uh, he's-he's killed at least
eight women that we know of.

30:02.322 --> 30:04.933
Uh, the police asked me to try
and get a psychic fix on him

30:05.020 --> 30:07.240
to see if I could get
a sense of who this man is.

30:07.327 --> 30:11.200
Uh, how do you do that exactly,
get a psychic fix on someone?

30:11.287 --> 30:13.115
Well, Davis

30:13.202 --> 30:15.204
true demonic evil
burns like fire.

30:15.291 --> 30:19.208
It-it burns with
a terrible cold, dark flame.

30:19.295 --> 30:22.211
I force myself
to look into that flame

30:22.298 --> 30:24.823
and I see an image
of the evildoer..

30:24.910 --> 30:27.086
In this case, Red John.

30:27.173 --> 30:30.350
He's an ugly,
tormented little man.

30:30.437 --> 30:32.178
A lonely soul.

30:32.265 --> 30:35.050
Sad, very sad.

30:56.071 --> 30:59.509
"Dear Mr. Jane, I do not like
to be slandered in the media

30:59.596 --> 31:01.772
"especially by
a dirty money-grubbing fraud.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.339
"if you are a real psychic

31:03.426 --> 31:05.385
"instead of
a dishonest little worm

31:05.472 --> 31:07.387
"you wouldn't need to open
the door to see

31:07.474 --> 31:10.564
what I've done to
your lovely wife and child."

31:15.656 --> 31:18.050
[door creaks]

31:19.225 --> 31:21.053
[Wagner]
'Mr. Jane?'

31:21.140 --> 31:22.881
'Mr. Jane?'

31:24.926 --> 31:27.668
'What is it
that keeps you awake?'

31:27.755 --> 31:29.061
[sighs deeply]

31:29.148 --> 31:30.410
Um.. \

31:35.894 --> 31:38.766
You know, when I was a boy,
we had a farm.

31:38.853 --> 31:40.899
It's a lot of work.

31:43.162 --> 31:45.425
I was kind of a lazy kid.

31:45.512 --> 31:46.643
Yes?

31:50.909 --> 31:52.867
I'd always be trying
to get my little brother Jimmy

31:52.954 --> 31:54.390
to do my Chores for me.

31:57.567 --> 32:01.571
One day, I promised him a dollar
if he'd cut the firewood.

32:01.658 --> 32:02.921
Hmm.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.879
'Well..'

32:04.966 --> 32:07.403
'he opened up an artery
in his leg on the saw'

32:07.490 --> 32:09.405
'and he bled to death..'

32:11.712 --> 32:14.976
...died..

32:15.063 --> 32:17.239
...doing my Chores for me.

32:23.028 --> 32:25.291
You know..

32:25.378 --> 32:27.858
that's almost
exactly the same thing

32:27.946 --> 32:30.513
that happened to Johnny Cash.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.167
Is it really?

32:33.560 --> 32:34.996
'Wow.'

32:36.432 --> 32:37.781
That's spooky.

32:43.787 --> 32:45.180
Mr. Randolph, good--

32:45.267 --> 32:47.182
Cut the crap.
My brother's done nothing.

32:47.269 --> 32:49.010
And you scumbags haven't got
the stones to come after me

32:49.097 --> 32:50.969
so you come after my family.
That is flat-out persecution.

32:51.056 --> 32:52.361
Price, what did we agree?

32:52.448 --> 32:53.710
Mr. Randolph, rest assured,

32:53.797 --> 32:55.016
there's no intent
to persecute you.

32:55.103 --> 32:56.409
We scumbags are holding
your brother

32:56.496 --> 32:57.758
because we have
physical evidence

32:57.845 --> 32:59.542
linking him to the crime
and potential motive

32:59.629 --> 33:01.066
in that he states that
whenever you weren't around

33:01.153 --> 33:03.111
he was banging your wife
like a big bass drum.

33:03.198 --> 33:04.721
[laughs]

33:04.808 --> 33:06.114
Tag and Alison?

33:09.596 --> 33:10.814
That's what he states,
and he further states

33:10.901 --> 33:12.468
that it was you
that killed Alison

33:12.555 --> 33:13.643
'and you're now trying
to frame him in revenge.'

33:13.730 --> 33:16.951
What'd you say? Wh..
Bastard!

33:17.038 --> 33:18.779
[Van Pelt]
'Hey.'

33:18.866 --> 33:21.347
Aah! Son of a bitch!

33:21.434 --> 33:23.566
[Tag]
'You treated her like
trash! What did you expect?'

33:23.653 --> 33:25.133
I didn't expect my little
brother to be banging my wife!

33:25.220 --> 33:27.135
You little punk bastard!

33:36.492 --> 33:40.322
Everything you've told me
is total fiction, isn't it?

33:40.409 --> 33:41.976
Yes.

33:42.063 --> 33:44.152
Why?

33:44.239 --> 33:46.633
I can tell
you're in real pain.

33:46.720 --> 33:49.201
Why not tell the truth?

33:49.288 --> 33:51.159
The truth is mine.

33:54.815 --> 33:57.339
- I hear ya.
- Thank you.

34:04.868 --> 34:08.307
Oh. Yes.

34:08.394 --> 34:11.005
Remember, uh, we were talking
about Tannen the other day

34:11.092 --> 34:13.399
and I asked you if he kept
a diary, and you said he did?

34:13.486 --> 34:15.314
Well, there's no diary
among his effects.

34:15.401 --> 34:17.272
- No.
- I'm sorry, no?

34:17.359 --> 34:18.795
No. You have it wrong.

34:18.882 --> 34:20.928
I-I didn't think
he kept a diary.

34:21.015 --> 34:26.151
Strange. Then it must have been
someone else who told me.

34:26.238 --> 34:28.109
Either that
or I'm going mad.

34:29.893 --> 34:31.939
But I definitely,
100% remember hearing

34:32.026 --> 34:33.767
that Tannen kept a diary.

34:33.854 --> 34:35.290
Well, that is strange

34:35.377 --> 34:37.553
but why does it matter
if he kept a diary?

34:37.640 --> 34:38.859
You're right.
It doesn't matter.

34:38.946 --> 34:40.774
Only I was thinking

34:40.861 --> 34:43.733
why do magicians have
beautiful girl assistants?

34:43.820 --> 34:45.431
Why?

34:45.518 --> 34:47.781
Because they're reliable
distracters of attention.

34:47.868 --> 34:50.305
People will look at a beautiful
girl for a long time

34:50.392 --> 34:52.829
before they look
where they should be looking

34:52.916 --> 34:55.484
if they wanna see
how the trick really works.

34:55.571 --> 34:57.225
[both chuckle]

34:57.312 --> 34:59.445
Anyhow, I'll send over a couple
of forensics guys tomorrow

34:59.532 --> 35:01.795
to search his office
and locate that diary.

35:01.882 --> 35:03.884
Mm, didn't they already
search his office?

35:03.971 --> 35:06.930
Oh, they never do it
thoroughly the first time.

35:07.017 --> 35:09.150
Once more for luck, eh?

35:09.237 --> 35:12.545
It's gotta be there somewhere.
Thanks for everything, doc.

35:12.632 --> 35:14.242
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

35:51.932 --> 35:53.934
Lost something?

35:55.501 --> 35:57.677
- How did you get in?
- Door was open.

35:57.764 --> 35:59.722
I think I left my phone
in your office.

35:59.809 --> 36:03.465
- The door wasn't open.
- Must have been. Here I am.

36:08.818 --> 36:10.124
What are you doing?

36:11.865 --> 36:13.519
[sighs]

36:13.606 --> 36:17.044
I confess, the temptation
to play detective

36:17.131 --> 36:19.612
was a little too strong.
I..

36:19.699 --> 36:21.657
I was looking
for that diary.

36:24.312 --> 36:26.140
I got a little
carried away.

36:26.227 --> 36:28.229
No kidding.

36:28.316 --> 36:30.579
No diary?

36:30.666 --> 36:31.972
No diary.

36:34.104 --> 36:36.890
Maybe I should have a gander.
I'm good at finding things.

36:36.977 --> 36:39.371
Be my guest.

36:47.901 --> 36:49.642
Hmm.

36:57.389 --> 36:59.826
Hmm.

36:59.913 --> 37:01.654
Hmm.

37:05.092 --> 37:08.008
Hmm.

37:19.019 --> 37:21.717
[grunts]

37:24.807 --> 37:26.331
[grunts]

37:28.898 --> 37:29.856
[sighs]

37:42.695 --> 37:44.262
Eureka.

37:49.702 --> 37:51.921
Dr. Wagner,
thanks for your help.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.976
Mr. Jane.

38:03.063 --> 38:06.327
Uh, your phone.

38:06.414 --> 38:08.155
Right.

38:09.852 --> 38:11.506
Thanks.

38:18.165 --> 38:21.124
Uh, yeah. Got it.

38:21.211 --> 38:23.388
Silly of me.
Well, good-bye again.

38:23.475 --> 38:24.867
Wait.

38:27.740 --> 38:29.611
Give me the diary.

38:52.155 --> 38:54.593
- It's very amusing.
- I try.

38:57.813 --> 38:59.859
[inhales sharply]

38:59.946 --> 39:04.646
I knew. I knew it might
be a trick, but I..

39:04.733 --> 39:06.648
I had to be sure.

39:06.735 --> 39:10.478
Yes. That's how
the trick works.

39:10.565 --> 39:12.654
What led you to me?

39:12.741 --> 39:15.831
Not that I'm saying I did it.
I'm just asking.

39:15.918 --> 39:19.182
When we first met, you said you
didn't know who Red John was

39:19.269 --> 39:22.447
but you have books
on criminal psychiatry

39:22.534 --> 39:25.450
there..
that have chapters on him.

39:25.537 --> 39:27.016
You're the Randolph
family doctor

39:27.103 --> 39:30.411
so you could easily
get a strand of Tag's hair

39:30.498 --> 39:33.283
and, being a doctor,

39:33.371 --> 39:38.332
you could hack up another human
without difficulty.

39:38.419 --> 39:40.552
It's obvious it was you.

39:40.639 --> 39:44.120
[scoffs]
That's it?

39:44.207 --> 39:46.166
You have nothing.

39:46.253 --> 39:47.950
That's just guesswork.

39:48.037 --> 39:49.778
Oh, I know.

39:49.865 --> 39:52.390
I just wanted to be sure
I had the right answer.

39:54.304 --> 39:56.611
I was surprised.
I gotta be honest.

39:56.698 --> 40:00.093
You don't seem to be
a wicked man.

40:00.180 --> 40:02.269
But you are.

40:02.356 --> 40:04.837
[chuckles]

40:04.924 --> 40:07.013
You're angry
about the letter.

40:09.232 --> 40:11.060
Yeah, it was
a bit mean-spirited.

40:13.889 --> 40:16.152
For the record,
I'm sorry about your family

40:16.239 --> 40:18.720
I can only imagine
your pain.

40:18.807 --> 40:23.029
I'm not...a wicked man.

40:23.116 --> 40:24.422
My conscience is clear.

40:24.509 --> 40:26.032
Really?

40:26.119 --> 40:29.557
Right now in Africa,
there's 3,000 beautiful children

40:29.644 --> 40:33.343
alive today who should be dead,
but they aren't because of me.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.044
Tannen was gonna ruin me

40:38.131 --> 40:40.829
and destroy all that work..

40:43.658 --> 40:45.007
...over nothing.

40:45.094 --> 40:46.531
Money.

40:46.618 --> 40:49.751
"Theft," he called it.

40:49.838 --> 40:51.405
"Embezzlement."

40:51.492 --> 40:55.061
Self-righteous idiot.

40:55.148 --> 40:56.584
It's simple math.

40:56.671 --> 40:58.281
If I go to jail,

40:58.368 --> 41:01.154
thousands of kids will die.

41:01.241 --> 41:04.287
So I made
a rational, moral decision

41:04.374 --> 41:06.899
to kill Tannen..

41:06.986 --> 41:08.204
...for the greater good.

41:08.291 --> 41:11.120
And Alison?
What did she do wrong?

41:11.207 --> 41:12.557
Mm.

41:12.644 --> 41:14.254
[electricity crackles]

41:14.341 --> 41:16.299
As you said, she was
the magician's assistant

41:16.386 --> 41:17.562
just a distraction.

41:17.649 --> 41:18.998
Oh.

41:19.085 --> 41:20.652
If only Tannen died,
the police would've been

41:20.739 --> 41:23.002
all over this place,
wouldn't they?

41:23.089 --> 41:27.136
Truly, is killing two
any worse than killing one,

41:27.223 --> 41:30.444
when so many lives are at stake?
I don't think so.

41:30.531 --> 41:33.273
You poor, sad man.

41:33.360 --> 41:34.492
You're under arrest.
Let's go.

41:34.579 --> 41:36.842
I'm pointing a gun at you.

41:36.929 --> 41:39.018
You really think
I would set you up so nicely

41:39.105 --> 41:40.933
and let you pull
a loaded gun on me?

41:42.543 --> 41:44.284
I took the bullets
out earlier.

41:44.371 --> 41:45.894
[metal clinks]

41:58.559 --> 41:59.865
- You're late!
- What?

41:59.952 --> 42:02.215
- Draw your weapon!
- Huh?

42:02.302 --> 42:03.695
Drop the gun!

42:03.782 --> 42:05.610
'Hands on your head.'

42:05.697 --> 42:09.091
Get down on your knees.
Down.

42:11.572 --> 42:13.400
[gun slides across floor]

42:15.794 --> 42:17.665
[laughs]

42:17.752 --> 42:20.625
[indistinct radio chatter]

42:24.846 --> 42:26.805
Closed case doughnuts
are here.

42:37.380 --> 42:39.208
I just went to get
sleeping pills, I swear to god.

42:39.295 --> 42:41.820
I-I didn't evenwannago.
You know I didn't want to go.

42:41.907 --> 42:43.952
Right.

42:44.039 --> 42:47.173
Yeah, you didn't
set Wagner up..

42:47.260 --> 42:49.218
...didn't figure
it was him days ago.

42:49.305 --> 42:51.133
You didn't let us
tear apart the victim's family

42:51.220 --> 42:53.571
simply to satisfy
your childish need for drama.

42:53.658 --> 42:55.398
Meh, that family
was screwed anyway.

42:55.485 --> 42:57.357
Don't blame yourselves, guys.

43:07.672 --> 43:10.588
[siren wailing in distance]

43:16.332 --> 43:19.422
Don't even start.
I'm still angry.

43:19.509 --> 43:21.729
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

43:29.171 --> 43:30.738
A frog?

43:30.825 --> 43:33.088
Well, this makes everything
better, doesn't it?

43:34.481 --> 43:35.787
[gasps]

43:52.455 --> 43:54.022
[keys drop on table]

44:14.869 --> 44:16.741
[grunts]

44:24.966 --> 44:26.838
[sighs]
