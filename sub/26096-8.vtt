14:42.089 --> 14:44.258
<i>But unlike my own experiments,</i>

14:44.341 --> 14:48.095
<i>you Flex Fighters had minds</i>
<i>all your own, didn't you?</i>

14:48.178 --> 14:50.723
<i>Then it started to get personal.</i>

14:56.937 --> 14:57.938
[weapon powers up]

15:11.619 --> 15:13.954
-[gasps]
-Noble, but pointless.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.665
I could just watch
as the poison finishes you,

15:16.749 --> 15:18.542
but I've never been a patient man.

15:18.626 --> 15:19.835
[whirring]

15:24.465 --> 15:25.424
[groans]

15:30.304 --> 15:32.473
[roars]

15:32.556 --> 15:35.476
<i>And so began my obsession.</i>

15:40.230 --> 15:43.025
<i>I admit, my focus blinded me.</i>

15:43.108 --> 15:46.570
<i>Slowed me down</i>
<i>and left Rook Unlimited vulnerable.</i>

15:46.654 --> 15:50.324
<i>There was no way I was prepared</i>
<i>for what happened next.</i>

15:59.333 --> 16:03.253
-Goodbye, Mr. Rook.
-All this time, Kane?

16:03.337 --> 16:06.840
Kane was the name I was willing
to turn my back on when I began this.

16:06.924 --> 16:10.511
-Began this? What are you--?
-We are the Tech-Men.

16:10.594 --> 16:14.264
But you might know us
as the Epsilon Society.

16:21.814 --> 16:25.943
And now what, you're going to expose
what I am to the people of Charter City?

16:26.026 --> 16:29.655
We intended to expose
the people of Charter City to order,

16:29.738 --> 16:31.949
structure and subservience.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.701
What you are now is irrelevant.

16:33.784 --> 16:37.579
Did you really believe we weren't aware
you have been this Stretch Monster

16:37.663 --> 16:39.623
from the very start?

16:40.416 --> 16:42.960
The Hyper-Flexarium program
should have ended long ago.

16:43.043 --> 16:47.172
In fact, it would have...
if a certain plane didn't suffer from,

16:47.256 --> 16:50.467
what was it, "engine failure"?

16:50.551 --> 16:52.302
You only know what I told you.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.971
Wrong again.

16:54.054 --> 16:57.099
One of the victims that went down
on that plane you sabotaged

16:57.182 --> 16:58.976
was an Epsilon plant.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.186
After 44's death,

17:01.270 --> 17:04.982
I pushed for Rook Unlimited's takeover
of the city's public works.

17:05.065 --> 17:09.987
Transit systems, security networks,
aligning itself with Epsilon's visions.

17:10.070 --> 17:15.117
But your Flexarium and the Flex Fighters
threatened to unravel all of that.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.327
Your personal obsessions

17:17.411 --> 17:19.997
are a direct affront
to everything we stand for.

17:20.080 --> 17:23.584
You always insisted
on flaunting your name.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.836
Now, we'll use it
to advance the Epsilon dream

17:25.919 --> 17:28.172
of a perfectly controlled society,

17:28.255 --> 17:30.591
guided by the advancement
of technology and science.

17:30.674 --> 17:34.261
Generously sponsored by Rook Unlimited.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.017
[groans]

17:40.100 --> 17:43.937
Tonight marks the dawning
of the Epsilon era.

17:44.021 --> 17:47.566
And we will usher in this era
with a sacrifice.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.109
[weapon charges]

17:49.943 --> 17:52.362
-Your end is our beginning.
-Stop touching it!

17:52.446 --> 17:53.781
I had it!

17:53.864 --> 17:56.033
Sixty Seven, Nineteen?
Stand down!

17:57.201 --> 17:59.203
I said stand down!

17:59.286 --> 18:00.454
[clears throat]

18:00.537 --> 18:01.872
Be right with you, Number One.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.792
Collect these insubordinates.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.543
[Ricardo] Dude, figure this out!

18:07.836 --> 18:08.879
[Nathan] Oh, got it!

18:09.505 --> 18:11.882
[device beeps]
Ready?

18:13.300 --> 18:15.344
-The Flex Fighters!
-[groans]

18:15.427 --> 18:16.970
Destroy them!

18:18.013 --> 18:20.099
[weapons fire]

18:21.975 --> 18:23.685
Remind me why we're rescuing
Rook again?

18:23.769 --> 18:26.271
Did you not hear Kane
ranting like a crazy man?

18:26.355 --> 18:28.732
The Tech-Men don't get to decide
who lives and who kicks it.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.025
Least not on our watch.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.360
[beeping]

18:31.443 --> 18:34.613
-That thing's gonna go off any second!
-Then let's do this!

18:36.115 --> 18:37.658
[gunfire]

18:42.496 --> 18:43.372
[grunts]

18:54.925 --> 18:56.760
Why hasn't that explosive
lived up to its name?

18:56.844 --> 18:58.929
I thought the Tech-Men
were supposed to be good at tech!

18:59.012 --> 19:03.142
Wait, what if instead of fighting
the Tech-Men, we fight their tech instead?

19:04.643 --> 19:05.978
Like this!
[grunts]

19:09.481 --> 19:11.650
Save the mainframe at all costs!

19:14.361 --> 19:15.654
[beeping]

19:22.494 --> 19:23.495
[grunts]

19:24.288 --> 19:27.791
Kane, you have no idea how long
I've been waiting to do that.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.168
I think I kind of do!

19:33.422 --> 19:36.675
And that's how I got here.
You know the whole story.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.178
Told you, you had to hear this.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.306
Especially that part at the end
where I seriously smashed Kane!

19:42.389 --> 19:44.141
Now you know why I've come to you.

19:44.224 --> 19:47.686
I may be your enemy,
but the Tech-Men are so much worse.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.897
You want us to help you?
This is insane.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.107
After everything you did to us?

19:52.191 --> 19:56.320
I don't expect you to help me.
Do it for your city.

19:56.403 --> 19:58.572
I'm not here asking
for anybody's forgiveness.

20:00.490 --> 20:05.245
But I am asking that you trust me.
The Tech-Men have to be stopped.

20:05.329 --> 20:08.582
You know that'd be a whole lot easier
if we had the public on our side,

20:08.665 --> 20:11.001
but somebody turned them all against us!

20:11.084 --> 20:14.922
No. I made the mistake of trusting you
before and that put us all in danger.

20:15.005 --> 20:18.425
The danger is already upon us.
Check the city's security cameras.

20:18.508 --> 20:20.260
[beeping]

20:28.268 --> 20:30.312
[whirring, whooshing]

20:34.107 --> 20:36.068
What is everybody doing?

20:37.611 --> 20:39.363
Check their arms and tell me what you see.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.290
-There's a tiny something.
-SmartMarks.

20:50.374 --> 20:53.126
Remember the tech I used
during the villain breakout

20:53.210 --> 20:54.044
so I could control them?

20:54.127 --> 20:56.463
The Tech-Man are now using it
on the people of Charter City.

20:56.546 --> 20:58.507
The Tech-Men have spread
across the city.

20:58.590 --> 21:03.220
They seem to be establishing checkpoints
of some kind. This is how they keep order.

21:03.470 --> 21:05.806
This is the nightmare I warned you about.

21:05.889 --> 21:10.269
People think SmartMarks are brand new
Rook tech that will improve their lives.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.895
They don't know they're being
tricked.

21:11.979 --> 21:14.481
I can disable those SmartMarks.

21:14.564 --> 21:17.985
But you'll have to trust me.
What do you say, Stretch?
