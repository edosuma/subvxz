[dramatic music plays]

00:09.384 --> 00:11.761
[narrator] This is a world like no other,

00:12.262 --> 00:16.182
one brimming with mystery
and teeming with danger,

00:16.683 --> 00:20.603
filled with hundreds of islands
strewn across vast seas.

00:24.899 --> 00:29.696
And throughout these seas are those
who live according to their own rules,

00:30.864 --> 00:33.783
who seek a life of freedom and adventure.

00:34.701 --> 00:38.455
This is a world of pirates!

00:41.708 --> 00:44.586
[man] Piracy is a scourge upon this world.

00:45.211 --> 00:50.091
For too long, villains and miscreants
have sown havoc across our seas.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.970
But the Marines,
on behalf of your World Government,

00:54.054 --> 00:56.931
strive to keep you safe and protected.

00:58.391 --> 01:02.812
And today we've made a great stride
in that effort.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.648
Gold Roger,

01:06.649 --> 01:09.444
the so-called King of the Pirates,

01:09.527 --> 01:11.112
has been captured.

01:12.113 --> 01:15.116
His reign of terror ends this day.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.243
Peace shall be restored.

01:18.119 --> 01:22.123
Let this be a message to break the spirit
of anyone foolish enough

01:22.207 --> 01:24.250
to follow in his footsteps.

01:26.461 --> 01:27.962
Gold Roger,

01:28.713 --> 01:30.757
you have been sentenced to death

01:32.133 --> 01:34.260
for the crimes of piracy,

01:34.886 --> 01:35.929
thievery,

01:36.554 --> 01:39.599
and conspiracy
against the World Government.

01:39.682 --> 01:42.393
-Do you have any last words?
-Yeah.

01:42.477 --> 01:45.480
Would you take these off?
Starting to itch.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.608
I warned you.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.946
You brought this upon yourself.

01:53.029 --> 01:54.906
That I did, Vice-Admiral.

01:54.989 --> 01:57.700
Now I'm bringing it to one and all.

01:59.452 --> 02:01.538
[man] By the authority
of the World Government…

02:04.249 --> 02:05.875
I declare your life

02:07.085 --> 02:07.919

02:08.002 --> 02:10.797
[man 2] Pirate King,
where is your treasure?

02:10.880 --> 02:13.550

02:19.931 --> 02:23.059
You want to know where my treasure is?

02:23.643 --> 02:24.686
I'll tell you.

02:25.186 --> 02:26.396
Wealth.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.314
Fame.

02:29.607 --> 02:30.483
Power.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.278
I found everything
this world has to offer.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.532
Free yourselves.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.367
Take to the seas!

[narrator] Gold Roger's final words
changed the world forever.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.039
A new age was born,

03:26.748 --> 03:29.042
the Great Pirate Era,

03:29.709 --> 03:34.631
setting off a race across the seas
to find the Pirate King's hidden treasure,

03:36.174 --> 03:37.383
the One Piece.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.899
[man] Ever since I was a kid,

03:52.982 --> 03:56.277
Shanks would tell me stories
about pirates and their adventures.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.322
So, yeah, the sea's been calling.

04:00.490 --> 04:05.036
Well, not exactly calling,
because I pretty much can't swim,

04:06.371 --> 04:07.622
but you get the idea.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.750
I'm setting out to follow my dream,

04:12.085 --> 04:13.378
to find the One Piece

04:14.671 --> 04:19.467
and become King of the Pirates!

04:22.720 --> 04:24.264
All I need is a loyal crew.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.100
I think about ten men should do.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.059
[bird squawks]

04:28.142 --> 04:30.853
Well, ten men and a bird.

04:32.146 --> 04:35.441
It's not gonna be easy.
The ocean is… is pretty big

04:36.025 --> 04:37.485
and kind of dangerous.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.529
[squawks]

04:40.154 --> 04:41.281
So what do you say?

04:42.573 --> 04:43.658
Are you with me?

Where is the pirate hunter Roronoa Zoro?

06:46.322 --> 06:48.241
Don't deny he was on your ship.

06:50.159 --> 06:53.955
He booked passage to Sixis Island.
After that, I don't know.

06:54.038 --> 06:58.835
Liar! I know Zoro must be after me.
Who else is worthy of his pursuit?

06:59.419 --> 07:01.963
He had a list
of pirates and their bounties.

07:02.046 --> 07:03.506
And of course, I was at the top.

07:03.589 --> 07:06.175
Actually, your name wasn't on it.

Hey, hey, hey.
I'm not gonna kill you, all right?

I just need you to be quiet.

-Do you have any food here?
-[Koby] What?

08:31.719 --> 08:33.095
I'm starving.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.265
Alvida doesn't let me eat
until after she finishes her meal.

-Who's Alvida?
-This is her ship.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.688
-She's captain of the Alvida Pirates.
-Oh, that's great!

-It is?
-[man] Yeah!

08:49.153 --> 08:51.656
-What do they look like?
-Pirates are scum.

08:52.823 --> 08:54.408
They're thieves and murderers.

to the traders by nightfall.

09:33.155 --> 09:35.449
Before those Marine bastards
get back on our trail.

09:35.533 --> 09:39.328
Easy with this, Roux. It's worth more
than the rest of the loot put together.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.246
[Roux] Aye, captain.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.623
Pretend it's a leg of lamb.
You wouldn't drop that.

[pirates laughing]

09:47.920 --> 09:49.672
-Here.
-[pirate] Got it, Captain.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.717
Luffy! I was wondering when you'd pop up.

09:52.800 --> 09:56.762
Our favorite street urchin
comes to welcome us back. [grunts]

09:56.846 --> 09:57.680
How ya been, kid?

09:57.763 --> 10:00.308
I'm not an urchin. I'm a pirate!

10:00.391 --> 10:01.350
[pirates laugh]

10:01.934 --> 10:04.520
I'm not joking.
I'm ready to join your crew.

10:05.354 --> 10:07.231
The sea isn't a child's game.

10:07.815 --> 10:10.943
It's dangerous.
The scars on my face are proof of that.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.988
I can do it, Shanks. I swear.

10:14.947 --> 10:15.781
You're not ready.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.367
I am. And I'll show you!

10:22.038 --> 10:24.165
Might want to take it easy on him,
Captain.

10:24.248 --> 10:26.500
He's got no family to speak of.
The kid's on his own.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.378
Better a disappointed kid now
than a dead one later.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.505
Let's get this done. [grunts]

10:31.589 --> 10:33.507
-These men need a drink.
-[man] Aye, Captain.

10:34.383 --> 10:36.844
-And a bath.
-Hey, Shanks!

10:39.639 --> 10:41.974
[Shanks] Put it down, Luffy.
Before you hurt yourself.

10:42.058 --> 10:45.436
I'm not afraid of getting hurt.
And I'll prove it to you.

10:50.024 --> 10:50.858

10:52.777 --> 10:56.113
[Koby] I don't get it.
Why would anyone want to be a pirate?

10:57.365 --> 10:58.866
'Cause it's the best thing there is.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.786
You have the… the wind in your back,

11:01.869 --> 11:03.287
the salty sea air,

11:04.288 --> 11:05.998
your loyal crew by your side.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.959
You never know what's on the horizon.

11:10.169 --> 11:13.631
It's all about being… free.

11:14.131 --> 11:16.509
Nothing's free about Alvida's crew.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.762
She tells me when to eat, when to sleep.

11:21.263 --> 11:23.432
I even have to paint her toenails.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.769
-So why don't you just leave?
-No one leaves Alvida!

11:26.852 --> 11:28.229
She'll never let me go.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.399
You should never let anyone
tell you what you can't do.

11:32.566 --> 11:33.901
If I did that,

11:34.819 --> 11:37.238
I never would've left my village
to go find the One Piece.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.574
Gold Roger's treasure?

11:40.658 --> 11:44.036
That's impossible.
Every pirate in the world is after that.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.372
Why shouldn't I be the one to find it?

11:46.872 --> 11:49.583
As soon as I'm out of here,
I'm on my way to the Grand Line.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.169
Pirate graveyard.

11:52.753 --> 11:56.382
There are a-hundred-foot waves
and sea beasts that'll crush your bones.

11:57.341 --> 12:00.177
Once you enter the Grand Line,
you never return.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.721
It sounds kind of fun.

[gasps]

12:05.224 --> 12:06.058
Wait!

12:06.892 --> 12:09.520
Is… is that…
is that one of the sea beasts?

12:09.603 --> 12:10.980
[Koby] It's just Alvida snoring.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.441
If you want to get out of here,
it's now or never.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.781
Lifeboats are tied
at the stern of the ship.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.160
[snoring]

12:39.091 --> 12:41.177
-Gonna need one of these.
-[Koby] Head due north.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.637
-You should hit land in a few days.
-North.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.097
Which way is north?

12:45.181 --> 12:47.057
[bell clangs]

12:47.141 --> 12:49.143
[Alvida]
What the hell is going on up there?

12:54.190 --> 12:56.275
-What's the meaning of this?
-Alvida, I can explain.

12:56.358 --> 12:59.028
You dare betray me to a bounty hunter?

12:59.111 --> 13:00.154
No, that's not it at all.

13:00.237 --> 13:03.032
And you, you're too scrawny
to be Roronoa Zoro.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.825
I'm Monkey D. Luffy.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.035
Never heard of you.

13:06.118 --> 13:09.872
Well, remember the name,
'cause I'm gonna be King of the Pirates.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.124
[pirates laugh]

13:12.917 --> 13:14.835
You must be new around here, boy,

13:14.919 --> 13:19.298
because who is
the most powerful pirate on the seas?

13:19.381 --> 13:22.051
-[pirates] Captain Alvida!
-Captain Alvida!

13:22.593 --> 13:23.636
Ah.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.473
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you, Koby.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.267
Who's the most powerful pirate
on the seas?

13:32.436 --> 13:35.648
-Answer me, you sniveling runt.
-He doesn't have to.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.691
Koby's his own man.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.486
-Shut up.
-[Alvida] No. No, he's not.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.656
He's mine, and he'll always be mine.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.783
That's not what he told me.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.453
He said that you were mean.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.121
-[chuckles]
-[Luffy] And cruel.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.457
And that you're as dumb as a sea cow.

13:53.541 --> 13:54.917
No, Captain Alvida! I didn't!

This one is for someone
I knew a long time ago.

[man 2] And the other?

16:36.996 --> 16:39.289
[man] You've been following me
for three days.

16:43.711 --> 16:46.714
-What do you want?
-[man 2] You may call me Mr. 7.

16:46.797 --> 16:49.800
I represent an organization
known as Baroque Works.

We are much, much more.

You should know it's a high honor
to be asked to join our ranks.

17:07.651 --> 17:09.486
Kind of got my own thing going on.

17:12.573 --> 17:16.535
Membership would make you
even more invincible, more feared.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.829

17:18.912 --> 17:20.456
My favorite is Number 1.

17:24.501 --> 17:26.920
To turn down Baroque Works

17:27.004 --> 17:28.797
is to forfeit your life.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.133
[Zoro] If they were that serious,

17:31.216 --> 17:33.802
they should've sent

Don't stitch it too good.
I want everyone to see my scar.

Scars don't make the man, Luffy.

It's the lesson behind the scar,
and you didn't earn this one.

Then let me earn it.
I'll be the best pirate ever.

You can't navigate.

Good fighter.

31:43.693 --> 31:45.069
[whimpering]

31:49.073 --> 31:52.285
You shouldn't draw your blade
unless you're prepared to use it.

31:52.368 --> 31:55.747
Don't kill me, please.
My father will give you anything you want.

31:55.830 --> 31:56.915
Who's your father?

31:56.998 --> 31:57.916
Captain Morgan.

31:58.833 --> 32:00.418
He's in charge of the Marine base.

32:02.420 --> 32:03.755
Then he owes me money.

32:08.927 --> 32:12.430
I understand you sent
four of my Marines to the infirmary.

32:15.141 --> 32:17.560
Without drawing a blade, I might add.

32:18.478 --> 32:19.687
Impressive.

32:20.188 --> 32:21.898
I didn't want to make a mess.

32:30.990 --> 32:34.327
Hmm. I'd say
you live up to your reputation.

32:34.410 --> 32:36.913
If it's all the same,
I'll just take my money and go.

32:36.996 --> 32:38.748
[Morgan] You'll collect your bounty,

32:39.248 --> 32:43.962
but the penalty for assaulting a Marine
is seven days strung up in the yard.

32:45.004 --> 32:46.255
No food or water.

32:46.839 --> 32:50.385
You can try to arrest me,
but your brat'll be the first one I kill.

32:50.468 --> 32:53.012
Hey! He can't speak to me that way!

32:56.766 --> 32:58.893
I like you.

33:00.061 --> 33:04.649
Oh, we should be working
for the same team.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.826
You'd make a hell of a Marine.

33:16.244 --> 33:17.120
Hmm.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.289
Kind of got my own thing going on.

33:20.373 --> 33:23.001
Doesn't leave much time
for playing dress-up.

33:26.462 --> 33:29.132
It's a shame
to lose a man of your talents,

33:30.675 --> 33:33.761
since you won't be able
to collect a bounty at any Marine base

33:33.845 --> 33:35.179
once I get the word out.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.808
So what's it gonna be?

33:41.144 --> 33:42.603
A new career? [chuckles]

33:45.565 --> 33:46.399
Or the yard?

33:49.360 --> 33:50.403
Seven days?

I could catch up on my sleep.

[Koby]
I can't stop thinking about that fight.

34:03.958 --> 34:06.127
That guy was amazing.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.130
And what's with the third sword?

34:09.630 --> 34:12.759
I mean, where does it even go?

34:13.968 --> 34:14.802
No.

34:17.013 --> 34:20.016
He had to protect that little girl
from the Marines,

34:20.641 --> 34:22.685
who were supposed to be protecting her.

34:23.269 --> 34:24.687
It doesn't make any sense.

34:24.771 --> 34:28.107
If there are good pirates
and bad pirates, then

34:29.609 --> 34:32.195
there are gonna be good Marines
and bad Marines too.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.159
You'll be one of the good ones.

34:39.702 --> 34:41.370
[Koby] Maybe Alvida was right.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.750
I don't know anything about the world.

34:45.833 --> 34:47.376
But you were her prisoner.

34:48.252 --> 34:50.088
Yeah, but I knew who I was.

34:50.171 --> 34:51.589
Now I have no idea.

Hey, Koby.

I need to get into the base
and find that map,

35:04.852 --> 35:06.395
and I could use some help.

35:08.064 --> 35:10.566
You want me to help you
steal from the Marines?

35:10.650 --> 35:12.193
No. Of course not.

35:14.403 --> 35:15.905
How about you help me

35:17.073 --> 35:18.407
get the boat ready?

35:18.491 --> 35:20.451
You can handle that, right?

35:21.035 --> 35:21.953
I guess so.

35:22.620 --> 35:23.788
What are you gonna do?

35:27.917 --> 35:29.377
I'm working on that.

[military marching music plays]

35:35.383 --> 35:37.093
Beautiful morning, isn't it?

35:38.219 --> 35:41.222
A bit hot for my taste though.

What do you say, puppy?
Do you want to do a trick for me?

Sit up and beg.

Ooh.

36:07.248 --> 36:10.168
What's so special
about this old thing? Hmm?

36:12.044 --> 36:13.838
Enjoy these seven days,

36:13.921 --> 36:16.007
'cause when I get down from here,

36:17.049 --> 36:18.634
you'll be the one begging.

When you get down?

You think my father's gonna let you go?

How did they even arrest you?

37:34.669 --> 37:35.503
They didn't.

37:38.381 --> 37:39.465
I gave myself up.

37:40.299 --> 37:41.509
Interesting choice.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.470
I'm sure you had your reasons.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.555
You don't know anything about me.

A woman with orange hair,
dressed like a Marine.

47:01.902 --> 47:04.238
She was trying
to steal a map to The Grand Line.

47:05.447 --> 47:07.783
My keys! Sound the alarm.

47:07.866 --> 47:08.826
[lock clicking]

47:08.909 --> 47:10.410
[alarm blaring]

47:11.703 --> 47:12.788
[Luffy] Uh…

47:13.831 --> 47:15.833
Do you think they know we're here?

47:16.333 --> 47:20.295
No, I think they're after the other thief
and idiot pirate trying to steal a map.

47:21.004 --> 47:22.422
What are the odds of that?

47:26.385 --> 47:27.761
Kidding. [chuckles]

47:29.805 --> 47:31.849
But you might want to work
a little faster.

47:33.559 --> 47:35.352
[banging on door]

47:36.436 --> 47:37.271
[Morgan] Open up!

47:37.896 --> 47:40.941
By the authority of the 153rd Marines!

47:42.276 --> 47:43.110
You need to hurry.

47:43.193 --> 47:44.862
-I can't rush this!
-Please hurry!

47:46.446 --> 47:47.531
I have an idea.

47:52.077 --> 47:53.120
[grunts]

47:54.162 --> 47:56.248
-That's your idea?
-Yeah.

47:56.331 --> 47:58.208
[Luffy grunting]

48:10.470 --> 48:13.140
[both scream]

48:19.021 --> 48:20.272
[both cough]

48:24.401 --> 48:25.611
How did you do that?

48:27.112 --> 48:29.281
[yelling]

48:29.364 --> 48:31.366
[action music plays]

48:32.951 --> 48:34.953
[grunting]

48:44.963 --> 48:46.548
[Luffy yells]

48:55.891 --> 48:58.101
[Luffy] Whoo! Whoo!

48:58.727 --> 49:00.812
-[yells]
-[grunting]

49:06.318 --> 49:07.402
[laughs]

49:10.322 --> 49:12.324
[grunting]

49:22.584 --> 49:24.586
[grunting]

49:27.297 --> 49:29.299
[mysterious music plays]

49:30.384 --> 49:32.302
[grunting]

49:32.386 --> 49:33.971
[action music plays]

49:40.602 --> 49:42.354
Aren't you that drunk from the bar?

49:43.563 --> 49:44.856
Glad I made an impression.

49:46.191 --> 49:49.111
The imposter, the pirate hunter,
and the prisoner.

49:50.028 --> 49:53.198
Fancy that.
The three of you working together.

49:53.281 --> 49:55.701
Yeah. We're a crew!

49:55.784 --> 49:57.494
-Nope, not a crew.
-Not together.

49:58.078 --> 50:01.248
No enemy has ever escaped my wrath.

50:02.624 --> 50:05.043
I alone defeated the Black Cat Pirates.

50:05.919 --> 50:09.506
I alone captured
Kuro of the Thousand Plans.

50:09.589 --> 50:14.845
And I alone keep Shells Town safe
from the scum of the East Blue.

50:28.984 --> 50:30.235
[cracking]

50:37.451 --> 50:39.286
[action music plays]

50:40.829 --> 50:41.663
Yah!

50:44.791 --> 50:46.084
[grunting]

50:49.504 --> 50:51.089
Ah!

50:52.382 --> 50:53.383
Oh.

50:53.467 --> 50:54.551
Whoa!

50:55.093 --> 50:56.553
[Luffy grunts]

51:12.027 --> 51:13.153
Yah!

51:30.879 --> 51:31.963
[yells]

51:33.423 --> 51:35.050
[grunts]

51:43.058 --> 51:44.226
[Zoro grunts]

51:44.309 --> 51:47.687
It's not only the axe.
Every part of his body's a weapon.

51:48.855 --> 51:51.191
I'll go high. You go low.

51:55.529 --> 51:57.656
[dramatic music plays]

52:16.174 --> 52:17.259
Ah.

52:18.301 --> 52:20.095
So that's where it goes.

52:23.265 --> 52:24.474
[grumbling]

52:26.560 --> 52:28.562
[action music continues]

52:30.730 --> 52:32.149
[grunts]

52:32.232 --> 52:34.568
[Luffy grunting]

52:36.361 --> 52:37.445
Ah!

52:40.157 --> 52:41.783
[grunting]

52:46.288 --> 52:48.665
Gum Gum Whip!

52:55.380 --> 52:57.507
Whoo!

52:59.176 --> 53:00.427
Ah!

53:01.428 --> 53:03.388
-Gum Gum Whip?
-[Luffy] Yeah!

53:04.097 --> 53:06.933
All the great fighters
call out their finishing moves.

53:07.475 --> 53:08.310
No, they don't.

53:08.393 --> 53:11.646
Hate to break up this beautiful moment,
but we need to get this safe out of here.

53:11.730 --> 53:15.275
Maybe if we find some rope or something.

53:18.028 --> 53:19.321
Or we can do that.

53:35.378 --> 53:37.839
-Careful with that!
-[Zoro] Whatever you say.

53:38.465 --> 53:39.299
Oh, wait.

53:40.175 --> 53:41.051
I don't work for you.

53:41.134 --> 53:43.678
I'm sensing a little bit of tension
amongst the crew.

53:43.762 --> 53:44.888
-Not a crew!
-Not a crew!

53:46.598 --> 53:49.893
-I can't leave without my friend.
-Can't wait. The Marines will be here.

53:50.769 --> 53:54.189
The Marines are here already.
You're under arrest.

53:56.691 --> 53:57.734
[chuckles]

53:59.527 --> 54:01.780
What's wrong with his hair? [laughs]

54:01.863 --> 54:03.323
Yeah, I might've done that.

54:05.325 --> 54:07.285
[man] I won't let you make a joke of me.

54:07.369 --> 54:10.372
I'm taking you in
and handing you over to my father.

54:11.206 --> 54:14.626
I'll be the hero.
I might even get a medal or something.

54:14.709 --> 54:15.877
[Koby grunts]

54:15.961 --> 54:16.795
[groans]

54:16.878 --> 54:18.880
-Koby?
-[Koby] God, that hurt!

54:19.673 --> 54:21.591
It also felt really good too.

54:22.342 --> 54:25.929
No time to explain, but we gotta go.
This whole island is trying to kill us.

54:26.846 --> 54:28.181
I'm not coming with you.

54:33.728 --> 54:34.688
You sure?

54:34.771 --> 54:37.315
Before we met,
every choice was made for me.

54:39.859 --> 54:41.611
But now I'm gonna do what I want to do.

54:42.988 --> 54:43.989
I'm gonna be a Marine.

54:44.072 --> 54:46.700
I want to help people
that can't help themselves.

54:50.412 --> 54:52.372
Next time we meet, we might be enemies.

54:53.248 --> 54:54.124
But for now…

54:56.209 --> 54:57.294
we're friends.

54:57.377 --> 54:59.337
[sentimental music plays]

55:10.473 --> 55:12.475
[majestic music plays]

55:31.202 --> 55:33.204
[action music plays]

55:43.089 --> 55:44.716
[babbling]

55:55.018 --> 55:56.019
This is Garp.

55:56.102 --> 55:59.606
[indistinct chatter over phone]

55:59.689 --> 56:00.982
Pirates, you say?

56:01.066 --> 56:03.651
[indistinct chatter]

56:04.903 --> 56:06.821
Raiding our base in Shells Town.

56:07.864 --> 56:08.782
[scoffs]

56:09.491 --> 56:10.909
What did they take?

56:11.493 --> 56:13.078
Weapons? Gold?

56:13.161 --> 56:15.163
[indistinct chatter]

56:22.045 --> 56:23.046
[receiver clicks]

56:32.639 --> 56:33.723
Change of plan.

56:35.350 --> 56:36.726
We're going to Shells Town.

56:38.019 --> 56:39.729
Got a lead on Baroque Works?

56:42.148 --> 56:44.901
We've been chasing those shadows
a long time. This is different.

56:47.570 --> 56:50.990
A map to the Grand Line has been stolen…

56:53.493 --> 56:55.578
by a pirate in a straw hat.

56:57.622 --> 56:59.249
[suspenseful music swells]

57:07.674 --> 57:10.844
[man] They were pirates, Captain,
just like us.

57:11.761 --> 57:13.054
And they got the map.

57:14.264 --> 57:16.766
[captain] And you didn't stop them.

57:16.850 --> 57:19.102
I couldn't. I mean,
there were three of them.

57:19.769 --> 57:22.188
They must've been planning this
for months.

57:24.149 --> 57:26.192
[suspenseful music plays]

57:42.333 --> 57:45.545
Well, that's my map.

57:47.005 --> 57:48.923
And I'm gonna get it back.

57:49.507 --> 57:51.468
[chuckles]

57:52.469 --> 57:54.179
No matter who I have to kill.

57:54.846 --> 57:56.181
[chuckles]

57:57.640 --> 57:59.934
[laughing]

58:04.814 --> 58:07.150
[theme music plays]

58:16.242 --> 58:18.077
This is my first pirate score.

58:18.161 --> 58:20.038
[suspenseful music plays]

58:20.121 --> 58:22.707
From now on,
it's all gonna be smooth sailing.

58:23.583 --> 58:25.335
[beast growls]

58:25.418 --> 58:27.128
[Luffy] This crew can handle anything.

58:28.713 --> 58:30.757
We've been making enemies
everywhere we go.

58:32.008 --> 58:33.301
[Buggy laughing]

58:33.384 --> 58:36.221
Nothing can stop me
from taking the East Blue.

58:37.889 --> 58:40.058
We've been captured. We need a plan.

58:40.141 --> 58:42.393
-[panting]
-[Luffy] Ah! Ah!

58:42.977 --> 58:44.145
That went pretty well.

58:46.731 --> 58:49.108
[Nami] Arlong will kill
the entire village!

58:52.111 --> 58:53.821
-Nami made her choice.
-[Luffy] Ah!

58:57.784 --> 59:00.787
[Luffy] We've got
each other's backs… always.

59:05.208 --> 59:07.877
[Garp] So these are the Straw Hat Pirates.

59:16.511 --> 59:18.221
[theme music plays]
