WEBVTT

00:04.105 --> 00:06.271
Why aren't you dressed?

00:06.273 --> 00:08.107
Well, brunch isn't
till 10:00.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.808
Right,
but then we go early,

00:09.810 --> 00:12.444
we get a table close
to the buffet, right?

00:12.446 --> 00:14.346
'Cause you can't sit
right<i> at</i> it.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.615
We learned that
at Sizzler.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.118
Just call Kristin and ask her
to save us a table.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.619
I mean,
we have some pull.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.988
She created the whole thing.
We created her...

00:22.990 --> 00:24.189
Nah.

00:24.191 --> 00:27.359
Nah, then she's got bigger
fish to fry -- literally.

00:27.361 --> 00:30.029
This seafood buffet
she created is amazing.

00:30.031 --> 00:33.699
It's like the ocean
just puked all over a table.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.534
I know why you
want to go early.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.336
-The brunch is her baby...
-No.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.837
...she's your baby.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.305
You want to make sure
everything goes okay.

00:40.307 --> 00:42.174
What are you talking?
She's got this all covered.

00:42.176 --> 00:43.509
She's doing a great job.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.010
She was at work last night
till 1:00 A.M.

00:45.012 --> 00:46.478
Yeah, and how do you
know that?

00:46.480 --> 00:47.746
I was just there,
you know,

00:47.748 --> 00:49.548
making sure the lobsters
don't claw her.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.482
I don't trust
those rubber bands.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.184
-Honey --
-They're very, very small.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.853
It is okay to admit that you
want to protect your daughter.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.655
-It's sweet.
-I'm not protecting her.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.824
I just want to make sure
the brunch goes okay.

00:58.826 --> 01:02.027
Yeah, that's called
protecting.

01:02.029 --> 01:04.496
(raspy) Oh.
Hey, you guys.

01:04.498 --> 01:07.666
Um...I've got
this thing.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.868
It's a...
sore-throat thing.

01:09.870 --> 01:10.702
Mm-hmm.

01:10.704 --> 01:14.373
So, uh, yeah...

01:14.375 --> 01:17.042
I'm not gonna be able
to go to church today.

01:17.044 --> 01:19.411
We're not going
to church.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.181
Today is Kristin's
first brunch.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.116
(clears throat)

01:26.420 --> 01:28.287
Oh, wait.
Oh, my God!

01:28.289 --> 01:29.855
(gasps)
Hold on.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.256
(chuckles)
I'm all better!

01:31.258 --> 01:32.925
I'm healed! Yes!

01:32.927 --> 01:34.960
Wow, that's a miracle.
(chuckles) Praise the Lord.

01:34.962 --> 01:37.563
You know, maybe you can
go to church next Sunday,

01:37.565 --> 01:39.431
and you can thank him
personally.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.567
(laughs) Okay.
I'm gonna go get dressed.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.435
I have the perfect
brunch outfit.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.404
It says I'm here
to pick up my food,

01:45.406 --> 01:47.206
look fabulous,
and judge others.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.474
Mandy, hey.

01:48.476 --> 01:49.708
You can't be late
for this, okay?

01:49.710 --> 01:51.443
I know you'd like to make
an entrance,

01:51.445 --> 01:52.644
but today's
your sister's big day.

01:52.646 --> 01:53.946
Let her shine.

01:53.948 --> 01:55.481
Okay, fine,
but who just got over

01:55.483 --> 01:57.149
a really brave battle
with illness?

01:59.220 --> 02:01.487
Why do her fake illnesses
give me a real headache?

02:01.489 --> 02:03.422
I'm gonna get ready.
I'll meet you there.

02:03.424 --> 02:04.923
All right.
Doll yourself up.

02:04.925 --> 02:08.327
You're competing
with scallops wrapped in bacon.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.786
About time, Mikey.

02:34.788 --> 02:37.956
Yeah, I'm the worst.

02:37.958 --> 02:40.626
Coming in an hour early
on my day off.

02:40.628 --> 02:41.660
Thanks for being here.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.961
Hey, no problem.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.596
If I was home,
I'd be watching TV.

02:44.598 --> 02:47.833
Here, I'm watching like
eight TVs, and I get overtime.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.302
You know,
this whole concept of brunch

02:50.304 --> 02:52.804
-doesn't make any sense to me.
-Well...

02:52.806 --> 02:54.306
I mean,
you get breakfast and lunch

02:54.308 --> 02:56.608
and you charge 'em once.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.444
Who's the genius that came up
with that idea?

02:59.446 --> 03:03.048
I think it was
Einstein's brother Melvin.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.950
Very creative family.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.785
You got to relax here.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.487
Kris did
a lot of research

03:08.489 --> 03:10.956
before she pitched
this buffet idea to us.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.058
Our customers
are gonna love this.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.826
Yeah?
Yeah, maybe too much.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.562
If you haven't noticed,

03:16.564 --> 03:18.630
they tend to be on the large side.
Well, you know...

03:18.632 --> 03:21.333
They take "all you can eat"
as a challenge.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.402
Go in your office,

03:23.404 --> 03:25.070
do something
to take your mind off it.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.371
When was the last time
you checked

03:26.373 --> 03:27.606
your ex-wife's
Facebook page?

03:29.376 --> 03:31.376
Yesterday.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.512
Yeah, don't worry
about this.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.981
Kris has got this
all taken care of.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.750
Mikey, please, I'm counting
on you to keep an eye on things.

03:38.752 --> 03:42.154
If this is a disaster,
we're done with brunch.

03:42.156 --> 03:43.855
I don't need to keep
an eye on anything.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.257
Ha! Yeah.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.758
Show me
the restaurant.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.160
On it.

03:48.162 --> 03:50.195
Uh, the buffet's all iced
and ready to go.

03:50.197 --> 03:51.496
Uh-huh.

03:51.498 --> 03:53.265
There's us looking
at the monitors.

03:53.267 --> 03:56.068
That's useless.

03:56.070 --> 03:59.371
I can't -- What's Kyle
doing on the loading dock?

03:59.373 --> 04:00.772
Enhance that for me.

04:00.774 --> 04:04.076
"Enhance"?

04:04.078 --> 04:06.411
This isn't "CSI," Baxter.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.413
I can make it bigger.

04:08.415 --> 04:12.251
Looks like he's opening
a bag of cat food.

04:12.253 --> 04:13.552
Oh, good.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.622
He's feeding stray cats
100 feet from a seafood buffet.

04:16.624 --> 04:19.057
What goes on in that kid's head?
I don't know.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.859
If you got close enough,
you'd probably hear

04:20.861 --> 04:23.095
a wind-up monkey
playing the cymbals.

04:35.743 --> 04:38.076
Hey, Kyle! Kyle!
What the hell are you doing?

04:38.078 --> 04:39.578
You said you didn't want
stray cats

04:39.580 --> 04:41.079
eating out
of the Dumpster.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.481
Problem solved.

04:42.483 --> 04:46.985
Now you're luring feral cats
to a seafood buffet.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.454
Oh, no.
They're not feral anymore.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.223
I named them.

04:51.225 --> 04:53.425
Well, of course you did.

04:53.427 --> 04:54.626
Tell you what --

04:54.628 --> 04:56.228
Get rid of the food
and the bowl,

04:56.230 --> 04:57.996
-close the loading dock door.
-Yes, sir.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.331
And you know what?

04:59.333 --> 05:01.767
Think of taking a day off
now and then.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.268
You're killing me.

05:03.270 --> 05:06.238
Isabella: Kyle,
get your lazy ass over here!

05:06.240 --> 05:08.674
Hang on, Isabella.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.075
(cat meows)

05:15.182 --> 05:16.181
Hi, Mom!

05:16.183 --> 05:17.349
Hey!

05:17.351 --> 05:18.483
(laughing) Hi!

05:18.485 --> 05:19.751
Wow!

05:19.753 --> 05:22.421
Wow, Kristin,
this is incredible.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.256
I know.
Isn't it?

05:24.258 --> 05:27.159
We have smoked
Pacific coho sal--

05:27.161 --> 05:29.528
Ah, ah!
Don't touch it --

05:29.530 --> 05:32.331
Alaskan king crab.
Don't touch.

05:32.333 --> 05:35.434
And, my personal favorite,
local rainbow tr--

05:35.436 --> 05:37.469
Don't!

05:37.471 --> 05:39.271
But I'm hungry.

05:39.273 --> 05:41.673
Have some ice.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.208
(laughs)

05:43.210 --> 05:45.444
Honey, I know how hard
you've been working on this.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.512
I mean,
you did an amazing job.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.948
Yeah, she's been
practically living here.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.284
Uh, by the way,
I'm Ryan, your husband.

05:52.286 --> 05:55.454
And that little guy you were
just talking to is your son.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.688
Ha, ha.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.523
Can we talk
about this at home?

05:58.525 --> 06:00.058
Sure, but first,
let's have

06:00.060 --> 06:02.361
the most important brunch
in the entire world.

06:02.363 --> 06:04.796
Hey, come on.
You guys don't bicker like this.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.032
Something is fishy.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.570
Ryan is upset
because he thinks

06:11.572 --> 06:13.638
I've been spending
too much time at work.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.073
You slept here
last night.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.908
I didn't get the room
finished until 2:00,

06:16.910 --> 06:19.077
and the food truck's
coming at 6:00, okay?

06:19.079 --> 06:20.746
It's not like
I was at the spa.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.247
This morning I showered

06:22.249 --> 06:25.317
with the sprayer we use
to wash the vegetables.

06:25.319 --> 06:27.085
This brunch has been
taking over your life.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.553
I mean,
we moved into a new house,

06:28.555 --> 06:30.222
and you haven't even
met the neighbors.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.923
They think
I'm a widower.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.393
We are up to our eyeballs
in casseroles.

06:34.395 --> 06:38.764
Hey, guys, let's not ruin
this special day by being...

06:38.766 --> 06:41.099
crabby.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.435
All right.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

06:43.437 --> 06:46.171
Just, I see food and...
[seafood]

06:46.173 --> 06:47.406
(laughs)

06:47.408 --> 06:49.508
Ha! I made a joke!

06:49.510 --> 06:50.509
Oh!

06:50.511 --> 06:52.411
I've gone too far now.

06:53.714 --> 06:54.880
Hey, your family's here.

06:54.882 --> 06:55.947
Great.

06:55.949 --> 06:58.383
And that shy busboy
finally had the guts

06:58.385 --> 07:00.419
to ask out
that cute waitress.

07:01.588 --> 07:02.921
What?

07:02.923 --> 07:06.291
You watch 'em all day,
you can't help but care.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.893
Just keep an eye on Kyle,
will ya?

07:07.895 --> 07:10.128
Make sure he doesn't do
something else really stupid.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.963
Uh, Baxter...

07:11.965 --> 07:14.099
That didn't take long.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.801
He left the door open.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.035
Oh, great.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.438
Now I have a warehouse
full of cats, and I hate cats.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.373
Dogs are right.

07:21.375 --> 07:23.141
Well, don't worry
about the cats.

07:23.143 --> 07:27.913
They probably ran away
when they saw this guy.

07:27.915 --> 07:28.780
Is that a bear?

07:28.782 --> 07:29.915
Yeah.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.818
You want me
to enhance it?

07:39.726 --> 07:42.561
Mike: I got to get my family
out of the grill.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.995
And I'll call
Parks and Wildlife,

07:43.997 --> 07:46.131
and let them know we have
a bear in the warehouse.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.299
A bear?

07:47.301 --> 07:49.768
Oh, shoot!
I forgot to close that door!

07:49.770 --> 07:52.304
Well, the good news
is I'm not mad at you

07:52.306 --> 07:53.738
about the cats anymore.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.140
I want you to go down
to the kitchen,

07:55.142 --> 07:56.475
get all the staff
up here quietly.

07:56.477 --> 07:57.642
You don't want
to panic them.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.277
I don't want
anybody panicked!

07:59.279 --> 08:00.645
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

08:00.647 --> 08:03.014
I heard yelling.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.518
Is there trouble
with the brunch?

08:06.520 --> 08:08.920
No! No! No!

08:08.922 --> 08:11.323
Uh, Chuck was asking
for a raise.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.659
Shut that down, Mikey.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.728
That's right. Hey.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.865
Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

08:20.968 --> 08:23.602
How are things going at the new house?
Uh, pretty good.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.637
Boyd has been helping me
with the decorating.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.506
You know what 10-year-old boys
suck at?

08:27.508 --> 08:29.708
-Decorating.
-Decorating.

08:29.710 --> 08:33.178
Yeah, he did the living room
in early American "Star Wars."

08:33.180 --> 08:34.880
Well, I'm sorry,
Kristin.

08:34.882 --> 08:36.882
When you move back in,
we will change it.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.119
Can you believe him?

08:41.121 --> 08:42.521
Kind of.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.456
I mean, I understand
where he's coming from.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.790
That's right.

08:45.792 --> 08:48.560
I should only complain
about Ryan to Dad.

08:48.562 --> 08:49.995
You know, honey,
whenever your father

08:49.997 --> 08:51.830
gets involved
in a new project,

08:51.832 --> 08:55.967
he also goes a little overboard
in his attention to detail.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.469
Isn't that a good thing?

08:57.471 --> 08:59.538
Yes, unless you're
one of the details

08:59.540 --> 09:01.373
he's not
paying attention to.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.776
I'm just saying
maybe cut Ryan some slack.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.846
Hey, Boyd, listen, I hid
a dollar bill up in the office.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.514
Why don't you go see
if you can find it.

09:09.516 --> 09:10.348
Cool!

09:10.350 --> 09:11.750
You too, honey.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.586
Why?

09:14.588 --> 09:16.354
What?
You don't need a dollar?

09:16.356 --> 09:18.390
What are you
talking about?

09:18.392 --> 09:19.658
What's with all
the questions?

09:19.660 --> 09:20.776
Let's just go upstairs.

09:20.777 --> 09:21.893
Everybody,
let's just go upstairs.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.529
Dad, I still have a ton of work
to do down here.

09:24.531 --> 09:25.530
Do it later.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.065
I need to be here now.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.067
You are never gonna get her
to leave, Mike.

09:29.069 --> 09:29.935
Don't even try it.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.670
Listen, excuse me.

09:33.707 --> 09:36.174
Everybody upstairs.
Now! Now!

09:36.176 --> 09:37.509
Come on, let's go.

09:37.511 --> 09:39.344
Let's go upstairs for a minute.
Come on.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.612
Is there
something wrong?

09:40.614 --> 09:42.247
Not if you enjoyed
"The Revenant."

09:47.020 --> 09:49.454
So, you just play
in here, Boyd.

09:49.456 --> 09:52.724
And, uh -- And if you hear
scratching at the door...

09:52.726 --> 09:54.292
i-it's just Grandma.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.694
So, uh --

09:55.696 --> 09:59.064
But don't -- don't open the door
for Grandma, no matter what!

09:59.066 --> 10:01.299
A-And if Grandma
does get in the door,

10:01.301 --> 10:03.768
then, uh --
then just remember to, uh,

10:03.770 --> 10:07.339
to stand real tall
and cover your neck.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.710
What the hell is a bear
doing in the store?

10:11.712 --> 10:12.744
He's ruining my brunch.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.379
I used to think
that bears were cute,

10:14.381 --> 10:18.049
but, you know what, as of today,
bears can kiss my ass.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.452
Brunch is gonna be fine.
We got this under control.

10:20.454 --> 10:23.121
Parks and Wildlife says
they can't get here

10:23.123 --> 10:24.589
for another 20 minutes.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.891
There's a bear
at a gas station too.

10:26.893 --> 10:29.561
Are there any bears
<i> in</i> the woods?

10:29.563 --> 10:32.130
All right, everybody.
We're all good up here.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.332
Everybody's fine
right where we are.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.834
Not Kyle.

10:35.836 --> 10:39.270
He's in the warehouse,
and he's got a rifle.

10:39.272 --> 10:42.173
Wait, wait.
He cannot kill the bear.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.142
Well, not with that gun.
It's a tranquilizing-dart gun.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.844
Also, he'll -- he'll just put
the bear to sleep.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.412
-That's perfect, right?
-(chuckles) Yeah.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.648
If we were legally allowed
to sell the tranquilizer

10:49.650 --> 10:51.416
that goes in the darts.

10:51.418 --> 10:54.185
So, he's about to corner
a wild bear

10:54.187 --> 10:56.755
and shoot it
with an empty dart?

10:56.757 --> 10:59.257
This is quickly becoming
one of those stories

10:59.259 --> 11:01.026
that bears tell
other bears.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.604
Kyle? Kyle?

11:12.606 --> 11:14.105
Kyle!

11:15.175 --> 11:17.542
Hey, hey!
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:17.544 --> 11:19.878
Listen, I-I know
I ask you this a lot,

11:19.880 --> 11:23.181
but what the hell
are you doing?

11:23.183 --> 11:25.550
I'm the reason
he's in here, Mr. B.

11:25.552 --> 11:28.053
Don't worry, we're giving
you credit for that.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.789
You know, there's not
tranquilizer in those darts.

11:30.791 --> 11:34.125
Really?
So what the hell am I doing?

11:34.127 --> 11:35.460
I don't know.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.629
We're gonna go back upstairs,
all right?

11:37.631 --> 11:40.298
(growls)

11:40.300 --> 11:42.300
Not that way, though.

11:43.637 --> 11:45.070
Am I not moving?

11:45.072 --> 11:46.971
Kyle, we're gonna be fine,
we're gonna be fine.

11:48.642 --> 11:50.308
Don't make a lot of noise
and just back away.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.843
Back away, back away.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.344
Okay, Mr. B.

11:53.346 --> 11:56.548
Hey, I wonder if it's true
that bears can smell fear.

11:56.550 --> 11:57.916
(roars)

11:57.918 --> 12:00.151
That would be
your answer!

12:12.065 --> 12:13.665
You know,
last time I did this,

12:13.667 --> 12:16.201
there were Jehovah's Witnesses
coming down the block.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.069
You're really funny,
Mr. B.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.972
It's gonna be an honor
to die with you today.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.111
If we do go to heaven,

12:26.113 --> 12:28.113
let me handle closing
the pearly gates, okay?

12:28.115 --> 12:31.449
Hey, Chuck, I need the ETA
on Parks and Wildlife, over.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.618
High tight, Baxter.
They're on their way.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.286
Chuck, shouldn't you
do something?

12:35.288 --> 12:37.455
I mean, you are head
of security for the store.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.290
Yes.
And I'll go down there

12:39.292 --> 12:41.760
as soon as the bear
starts shoplifting.

12:41.762 --> 12:44.629
Look, you know,
Mike and Kyle will be fine.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.197
When the bear
smells the food,

12:46.199 --> 12:47.932
he'll head straight
for the buffet.

12:47.934 --> 12:51.536
Well, I guess that's the end
of brunch at Outdoor Man.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.872
Oh.
I'll talk to her.

12:53.874 --> 12:57.776
No, you know what?
I will go talk to her.

12:57.778 --> 13:01.146
Well, this sucks.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.615
I know how much work
you put into this thing.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.717
I was scared.

13:05.719 --> 13:07.285
What?

13:07.287 --> 13:09.053
That's why I was
working so much.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.422
This was the first big thing
I've done on my own.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.725
No, it's not.
What about the grill?

13:13.727 --> 13:15.894
Dad and Ed helped me
with that.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.462
This was all me.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.064
And I just wanted to prove
that I could do it --

13:20.066 --> 13:23.334
not even to them,
to myself.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.503
I didn't know.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.105
But after spending
four days

13:27.107 --> 13:29.073
looking for the perfect
shrimp fork,

13:29.075 --> 13:31.910
turns out I forgot
the first rule of brunches --

13:31.912 --> 13:33.511
no bears!

13:34.848 --> 13:38.983
I'm sorry I put you and Boyd
through that.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.718
All for nothing.

13:48.695 --> 13:52.297
I feel so bad for her.
I wish I could do something.

13:52.299 --> 13:55.867
I think I can.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.774
Hello?

14:05.946 --> 14:08.246
Anybody here?

14:09.783 --> 14:13.284
Olly olly oxen free!

14:13.286 --> 14:16.855
Whatever that means!

14:16.857 --> 14:20.058
Nobody here
for Kristin's big day.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.160
Classic!

14:22.162 --> 14:24.262
(laughs)

14:34.741 --> 14:37.242
This is so dumb.
I am so dumb.

14:44.985 --> 14:45.817
Okay, here we --

14:45.819 --> 14:47.485
-Hey!
-Aah!

14:47.487 --> 14:49.888
What are you doing?
You have to run.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.990
(laughs)
I'm in brunch heels.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.658
I'm not running anywhere.

14:53.660 --> 14:54.993
What are you doing?

14:54.995 --> 14:56.427
Okay, there is a bear
in the store,

14:56.429 --> 14:57.762
and everyone's upstairs.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.097
You need to get up there
right now, okay?

14:59.099 --> 15:00.832
What?

15:00.834 --> 15:03.534
If there's a bear in the store,
why are you holding a salmon?

15:03.536 --> 15:06.404
'Cause I am trying not to have
Kristin's brunch get ruined,

15:06.406 --> 15:08.840
so I'm gonna lure it
out of the store with this.

15:08.842 --> 15:11.542
Oh, no! A bear!
Bears are so dangerous!

15:11.544 --> 15:13.878
Don't let him eat
my little face!

15:13.880 --> 15:15.847
(high-pitched squealing)

15:15.849 --> 15:17.282
Oh, please, I'm trying not
to think about that, okay?

15:17.284 --> 15:18.616
Just run, okay?

15:18.618 --> 15:22.954
Should of just gone
to church. God.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.224
Are you okay, Mike?

15:26.226 --> 15:27.892
(bear roars)

15:27.894 --> 15:30.094
Yeah, we're great.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.263
W-Will these boxes
protect us from the bear?

15:32.265 --> 15:34.232
No, probably not,
but it'll be something

15:34.234 --> 15:36.100
to send our organs
to the hospital in.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.568
Ryan: Bear?

15:37.570 --> 15:40.571
Where are you,
peaceful woodland creature?

15:40.573 --> 15:42.073
Want some brunch?

15:42.075 --> 15:44.976
Hey, what's Ryan
doing down here?

15:49.382 --> 15:55.019
Oh, God!
You are huge!

15:56.389 --> 15:59.557
Ryan just ran past the bear
holding a salmon.

15:59.559 --> 16:03.761
How did that kid's ancestors
ever survive?

16:03.763 --> 16:04.896
Come and get it, bear!

16:04.898 --> 16:06.764
Delicious,
wild-caught salmon

16:06.766 --> 16:10.068
from our already-
overfished oceans!

16:10.070 --> 16:12.403
He's trying to draw
the bear away.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.938
Did it work?

16:13.940 --> 16:15.940
(growls)

16:15.942 --> 16:19.477
Please tell me
that's a cat.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.846
The bear ignored
the salmon.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.581
Why would that bear
ignore a salmon?

16:23.583 --> 16:24.916
What does he want
in here?

16:24.918 --> 16:26.017
He's after me.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.285
Yeah?

16:27.287 --> 16:29.520
It's my conditioner.
It's honey lavender.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.622
It doesn't make any sense,

16:31.624 --> 16:35.026
unless he...is a she.

16:35.028 --> 16:37.295
Whoa.

16:37.297 --> 16:40.465
He had -- Oh.

16:40.467 --> 16:43.201
(whimpering)

16:43.203 --> 16:44.836
(chuckles)

16:44.838 --> 16:47.338
Oh, he's adorable!

16:47.340 --> 16:49.841
Yeah, well,
we're not keeping him.

16:49.843 --> 16:52.477
Listen, we found
a bear cub in here.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.312
Been nice knowing you,
Baxter.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.681
Oh, thank God.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.816
Parks and Wildlife
are here, Mike.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.985
No, no, no, no. You tell
Parks and Wildlife to calm down.

17:00.987 --> 17:03.454
If they see that bear getting
aggressive, they may put it down.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.856
They do not want
that bear hurt.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.691
Give me five minutes
to get this cub out of here.

17:06.693 --> 17:07.992
You copy that?

17:07.994 --> 17:10.194
Wait, there's really
a bear in the store?

17:10.196 --> 17:11.896
Will this be
on national news,

17:11.898 --> 17:13.865
because I'm only dressed
for local.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.133
I need to move
these boxes.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.534
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:16.536 --> 17:18.203
Mr. B, are you sure
that's a good idea?

17:18.204 --> 17:19.871
'Cause I've come to really
appreciate that door.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.305
The bear doesn't
want to hurt us.

17:21.307 --> 17:22.907
The bear just wants
to protect her cub.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.375
Help me move these
out of the way.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.710
All right,
get behind the door.

17:25.712 --> 17:26.711
Let's go.
Come on.

17:26.713 --> 17:27.645
Come here,
come here.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.213
It's all right,
it's all right.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.648
It's okay.
It's all right.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.984
It's all right,
it's all right.

17:32.986 --> 17:34.218
(bear growling)

17:49.903 --> 17:50.968
Come on, come on.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.216
And that, Kyle, is...

18:05.218 --> 18:07.785
why we don't
feed cats.

18:11.558 --> 18:14.292
Mama and baby bear
are headed back to the woods.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.527
Yeah, with a salmon
and an adventure

18:16.529 --> 18:18.262
they will remember
forever.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.031
You know,
bears like bread, too.

18:20.033 --> 18:22.567
You always got to figure out
a way to cost me money,

18:22.569 --> 18:24.969
but, uh, appreciate what you did.
Thank you.

18:24.971 --> 18:26.904
We'll follow them
to make sure they get there

18:26.906 --> 18:28.873
without incident,
but you folks are all clear.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.942
-Thank you.
-Thanks for coming by.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.211
I cannot believe
you did that!

18:33.213 --> 18:34.278
That was so --

18:34.280 --> 18:35.713
Brave?

18:35.715 --> 18:39.117
Uh, I was gonna say stupid,
but I guess it can be both.

18:39.119 --> 18:42.153
I didn't want all your hard work
to go to waste.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.388
But, yeah.
That was really dumb.

18:44.390 --> 18:45.623
Yeah.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.992
Isn't he the sweetest?

18:47.994 --> 18:50.795
I did something
stupid, too.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.930
You're damn straight,
Baxter.

18:52.932 --> 18:56.667
You dying on my watch is not
gonna help my Yelp reviews.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.304
Why'd you take the risk
of opening that door?

19:00.306 --> 19:02.440
I think maybe he knows
what it feels like

19:02.442 --> 19:03.975
to want to protect
your cub.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.343
Right, papa bear?

19:05.345 --> 19:07.078
You know, in the book,

19:07.080 --> 19:09.814
the mama bear
doesn't talk so much.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.917
I love it
when you get embarrassed

19:12.919 --> 19:15.419
because you
have feelings.

19:15.421 --> 19:19.857
Kyle, did you do
anything stupidly brave?

19:19.859 --> 19:23.161
No. I was smart.

19:23.163 --> 19:27.331
You tried to shoot an angry
mama bear with a dart gun.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.934
Hey, yeah!
That was super dumb!

19:29.936 --> 19:32.003
Yay! Kyle wins!

19:32.005 --> 19:33.471
Hey, it's almost 10:00.

19:33.473 --> 19:36.274
Aren't we all excited
about doing something?

19:36.276 --> 19:38.809
My brunch!
Get out of my way!

19:38.811 --> 19:40.678
Come on, come on.
You want to get a good table.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.881
What's the point?
No more salmon.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.117
So, you --

19:49.556 --> 19:51.489
What's everybody
doing up here?

19:51.491 --> 19:54.358
Am I the only one who cares
about this damn brunch?

19:54.360 --> 19:56.093
Come on, let's go.

20:00.466 --> 20:02.133
It's kind of cute
that everybody thinks

20:02.135 --> 20:04.368
I don't know anything
about the bear, huh?

20:13.179 --> 20:14.979
Hey, Mike Baxter
for Outdoor Man.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.081
Over the years,
I've found myself facing

20:17.083 --> 20:18.649
some pretty scary situations --

20:18.651 --> 20:20.351
Anacondas in the Amazon --

20:20.353 --> 20:22.153
ckk, ckk, ckk, ckk, ckk! --

20:22.155 --> 20:24.255
hungry lions
on the Serengeti --

20:24.257 --> 20:26.023
"Down, boy --"

20:26.025 --> 20:30.361
a woman's book club that ran
out of vodka in my own home.

20:30.363 --> 20:34.198
(slurring)
Eat, pray, refill!

20:34.200 --> 20:36.434
(normal voice) But as any
outdoorsman will tell you,

20:36.436 --> 20:37.868
there's no place as dangerous

20:37.870 --> 20:41.105
as being between a mama bear
and her cub.

20:41.107 --> 20:45.543
It's like being between Hillary
and a Wall Street moneyman.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.411
Of course,
a mama bear only worries

20:47.413 --> 20:49.213
about her offspring
for 17 months,

20:49.215 --> 20:51.782
then she kicks them in the ass
and chases them away.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.618
Humans --
we don't stop worrying

20:53.620 --> 20:56.053
about our kids
until two weeks after we die.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.788
You'd think
it would get easier

20:57.790 --> 20:59.357
once they leave the nest,

20:59.359 --> 21:01.692
but it actually gets worse
once they roam free.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.294
All we do is fret.

21:03.296 --> 21:07.365
We can even tag their ears so
we can track their migrations.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.466
Or can we?

21:08.468 --> 21:10.468
Trademark Outdoor Man.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.803
(clicks tongue)
"Dad!"

21:12.805 --> 21:14.538
Yeah, being a human parent

21:14.540 --> 21:17.375
means signing
an eternal contract to worry.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.210
And when you finally see
the bright light

21:19.212 --> 21:20.778
coming towards you
at the very end,

21:20.780 --> 21:22.647
you know what your last
thought's gonna be?

21:22.649 --> 21:25.216
(imitates flatline)

21:25.218 --> 21:28.286
I got to check the tire pressure
on Mandy's car!

21:28.988 --> 21:32.056
