WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:04.254
Previously on 90210...
SILVER:
Dr. Sukaly? I got my donor's

00:04.296 --> 00:06.089
signature giving up
his paternal rights.

00:06.131 --> 00:07.174
I really need
to get my forms back.

00:07.215 --> 00:08.132
I realized I made a mistake.

00:08.175 --> 00:10.928
That's why we
called the donor.

00:10.970 --> 00:12.262
You forged
my signature?
Teddy...

00:12.304 --> 00:14.723
I can explain.
No, you can't.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.517
I need to speak to one of your
guests, Max Miller. It's urgent.

00:16.558 --> 00:19.186
WOMAN:
I'm sorry. Mr. Miller
never checked in.

00:19.227 --> 00:20.479
Mr. and Mrs. Miller?

00:20.521 --> 00:23.231
I'm wondering
if you maybe heard from...

00:23.273 --> 00:24.859
Max.
DIXON:
Do you think, just because

00:24.900 --> 00:26.861
you cheated on me
that you'll be able to walk out

00:26.902 --> 00:29.738
of my new company? You signed
a contract. I own you.

00:30.823 --> 00:32.700
Where's this coming from?

00:32.741 --> 00:34.409
No talking.

00:34.451 --> 00:35.995
Dixon, we need to talk.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.663
Seriously?

00:37.705 --> 00:39.540
I'm starting to take us,
together, more seriously.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.709
I don't know what to say.

00:41.750 --> 00:42.877
I act like
this whole wheelchair thing

00:42.918 --> 00:44.753
doesn't change anything,
but I know that it does.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.714
Eventually,
she's either gonna feel like

00:46.755 --> 00:48.632
she can't take this on anymore,
or that I'm holding her back.

00:48.674 --> 00:50.551
Dr. Bronson,
I've changed my mind.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.051
I want to go through
with the spinal surgery.

00:52.093 --> 00:54.013
I'm not insane.
(groans)

00:54.054 --> 00:55.556
ASHLEY:
I'm doing this for you.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.766
You'll be traveling in this.

00:57.808 --> 01:00.268
You're gonna put me in a box?
If you won't let me protect you,

01:00.310 --> 01:01.603
you leave me no other choice.

01:01.645 --> 01:02.396
No!

01:02.437 --> 01:04.355
(gunshot)

01:04.397 --> 01:05.941
ANNIE:
What you went through--

01:05.983 --> 01:09.403
I can't imagine. Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?
Yeah.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.279
Absolutely.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.531
Have a nice day.

01:12.573 --> 01:16.368
What the hell's
wrong with you?

01:20.915 --> 01:24.960
And while I was busy trying
to get Max's job back...

01:25.002 --> 01:26.169
Which I asked her not to do...

01:26.211 --> 01:28.338
Max was supposed
to be in Iceland,

01:28.380 --> 01:30.131
at an international
geek conference.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.634
Instead, he was hiding
at his parents' house,

01:32.676 --> 01:34.135
watching Star Wars
in footie pajamas.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.846
MAX:
Thermal underwear.

01:35.888 --> 01:37.765
The basement
has a damp draft, so...

01:37.806 --> 01:39.266
I rest my case.

01:39.307 --> 01:41.602
Look, I-I know
that I shouldn't have lied

01:41.643 --> 01:44.980
about going to Iceland, but...
she keeps trying to run my life.

01:45.022 --> 01:46.815
This morning,
I found a business card

01:46.857 --> 01:48.859
in my pant pocket
for a spiritual advisor.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.652
NAOMI: Who was single-handedly
responsible

01:50.694 --> 01:51.904
for Madonna's comeback.

01:51.946 --> 01:54.155
Max, your future affects me,
too-- we're married.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.365
Marriage isn't about

01:55.407 --> 01:57.158
picking a-a single life course.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.744
It's about being happier
together

01:58.786 --> 02:00.412
while pursuing your own dreams.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.830
Do you have a
career, Naomi?

02:01.872 --> 02:03.707
Absolutely.
I'm an event planner.

02:03.749 --> 02:06.043
She hasn't planned an event
since my wedding.

02:06.085 --> 02:08.086
My... my other wedding.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.005
Is it possible
you're overly-focused on Max

02:10.047 --> 02:11.673
because
you're having a hard time

02:11.715 --> 02:13.759
establishing your own identity
in this marriage?

02:13.801 --> 02:16.470
No, no, no--
I'm not the one who ran away.

02:16.511 --> 02:17.429
(scoffs)

02:17.471 --> 02:18.388
This is about Max.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.723
I'm here to help.

02:19.765 --> 02:21.433
I love... I love you, Max.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.268
I-I want you to be happy.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.353
In that case, it sounds like
what Max needs is

02:25.395 --> 02:27.106
to be able
to make his own decisions.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.315
Okay. That's fine.

02:28.356 --> 02:29.733
WOMAN:
Great.

02:29.775 --> 02:33.194
Naomi, I suggest you spend
some time focusing on yourself.

02:33.236 --> 02:36.991
You may be surprised to find
you need it as much as Max does.

02:37.032 --> 02:39.367
Absolutely.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.496
From here on out,
it's all about me.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.414
(laughs)

02:48.961 --> 02:50.921
Teddy...

02:50.963 --> 02:52.297
Hey.

02:52.339 --> 02:53.715
Please stop.

02:53.757 --> 02:56.760
Look, I'm sorry to ambush you,
but I went to the beach house.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.137
Dixon said you've
hardly been there,

02:58.177 --> 03:00.055
and you haven't
returned any of my calls.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.598
'Cause I don't want to see you.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.266
Look, when your
Uncle Charles insisted

03:03.308 --> 03:05.352
that we destroy the embryos,
yeah, I freaked out,

03:05.393 --> 03:07.186
and yes, I...
I forged your signature,

03:07.228 --> 03:08.522
but I went to the clinic

03:08.563 --> 03:10.858
so that I could get the
paternity rights waiver back.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.943
I would never have
gone through with it.

03:12.985 --> 03:15.779
"It" meaning what? Silver,
what exactly was your plan?

03:15.821 --> 03:18.239
Steal the embryos,
get knocked up and run away,

03:18.281 --> 03:20.075
hoping I wouldn't
hear about it?

03:20.117 --> 03:22.285
That's kidnapping.
It's a felony.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.079
Just like forging my signature.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.414
If I pressed charges,
you could go to prison.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.708
You're my best friend,

03:27.749 --> 03:30.169
and deep down, you know
that we can work this out.

03:30.209 --> 03:31.753
Otherwise,
why are you still in town?

03:31.795 --> 03:33.964
Because my lawyers
are drawing up a petition

03:34.006 --> 03:36.008
to destroy the embryos.

03:42.973 --> 03:45.308
(techno musical intro plays)

03:45.350 --> 03:49.229
♪ 'Cause, baby, when you look
straight into my fries ♪

03:49.270 --> 03:52.816
♪ You can't get away
without a side ♪

03:52.858 --> 03:56.945
♪ 'Cause I'm a shake charmer. ♪

03:56.987 --> 03:58.113
(music stops)

03:58.155 --> 04:00.032
Okay, that's good.
Thank you.

04:01.533 --> 04:04.327
Look, I went
to your launch party,

04:04.369 --> 04:05.579
and I apologized
for being late.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.581
How much longer are you going
to torture me?

04:07.622 --> 04:10.084
This isn't torture, Ade.
It's income.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.086
I invested
all the money

04:12.127 --> 04:14.504
Annie gave me into getting
studio space and equipment.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.757
Like it or not,
you signed a contract

04:16.798 --> 04:19.509
giving me the rights
to exploit you "in all markets."

04:19.551 --> 04:21.302
I can't release you
till I'm out of the hole.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.097
Well, I'll be singing
denture jingles by then.

04:23.138 --> 04:25.432
I promise you that every cent
of my commission is going

04:25.473 --> 04:26.767
to pay off the label's debt.

04:26.808 --> 04:29.019
If you don't believe me,
you can call the accountant.

04:30.395 --> 04:31.521
Morning. Hi.

04:31.563 --> 04:32.814
Morning, babe.

04:32.856 --> 04:35.025
Hey, Adrianna.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.652
Nice to see you, too.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.613
(sighs)

04:39.654 --> 04:41.615
Yeah, uh, don't
worry about Ade.

04:41.656 --> 04:42.908
She'll come around.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.826
She's, uh, actually
a nice girl...

04:44.868 --> 04:46.494
when she's not
cheating on me,

04:46.536 --> 04:48.496
or trying to kill Silver,

04:48.538 --> 04:50.498
or pregnant and on drugs.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.501
I just can't imagine why things
didn't work out with you two.

04:53.543 --> 04:57.005
Anyway, Adrianna's the least
of my problems right now.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.007
What do you mean?

04:59.049 --> 05:01.509
I just got my tuition
statement for CU.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.053
My dad didn't have
life insurance,

05:03.095 --> 05:05.555
and there's no way
my mom can pay for school.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.390
Without a job or three,

05:07.432 --> 05:09.726
I might have
to move back to San Diego.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.770
But hey, maybe
we can be pen pals.

05:11.812 --> 05:12.938
Whoa. No, no, no, no.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.689
We'll find you a
scholarship or something.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.276
No, I just came
from the financial aid office.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.486
They're trying,
but even loans are hard to get

05:19.527 --> 05:20.612
this late in the year.

05:20.654 --> 05:24.658
Okay. Well, um,
come work here for me.

05:24.699 --> 05:26.493
Dixon, the label's in debt.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.495
I'm not going to be
anybody's charity case.

05:28.536 --> 05:31.081
But I just
want to help.
I know,

05:31.123 --> 05:33.458
but the best way you can help is
just to stay out of it.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.752
And I'm a big girl.
I can take care of myself.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.593
Hey.

05:43.635 --> 05:46.429
Here's, uh, another one,
just in case.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.389
I thought maybe you would...

05:48.431 --> 05:50.558
Awesome! This can be
the smothering pillow.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.352
Liam, I'm fine. I told you.

05:53.394 --> 05:57.482
Plus, I have finally uploaded
the homecoming photos,

05:57.524 --> 05:59.026
so if I weren't
feeling better already,

05:59.067 --> 06:00.235
I definitely
would be now.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.779
Mm-hmm.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.489
Ugh. The one day I decided

06:04.531 --> 06:06.325
not to shave my legs.
(laughs)

06:09.119 --> 06:10.120
Um...

06:10.162 --> 06:12.206
I must have
missed that one.

06:12.247 --> 06:13.832
You okay?

06:13.874 --> 06:18.586
I'm fine. Yeah, I'm not the one
that got shot by Ashley, right?

06:18.628 --> 06:20.255
I think I'm just
gonna go to the gym.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.423
I'll catch you later.

06:24.676 --> 06:25.635
Hey, man.

06:25.677 --> 06:26.761
How you holding up?

06:26.803 --> 06:29.264
I'm fine. I'm fine.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.392
Uh... pff!

06:33.434 --> 06:34.644
Well, hey.
Hmm.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.479
I brought over some of
your stuff from the beach house,

06:36.521 --> 06:38.397
where you could still stay
and let me take care of you.

06:38.439 --> 06:39.941
Thank you, but I feel like

06:39.983 --> 06:41.985
I should be here
for Liam, you know?

06:42.027 --> 06:43.320
I'm worried about him.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.655
Yeah.

06:45.697 --> 06:49.701
He, uh, did it up with this
whole nursemaid routine, huh?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.161
Yeah.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.454
Actually, those are from Riley.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.957
"To the cutest shooting victim
I know."

06:55.999 --> 06:57.751
You guys must be getting

06:57.792 --> 06:59.294
really serious, huh?

06:59.336 --> 07:00.879
Yeah. He is.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.381
At Navid's Christmas party,

07:02.421 --> 07:04.883
Riley basically said
he was falling in love with me.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.134
And you said...?

07:06.176 --> 07:07.094
Oh.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.845
Oh?
I didn't know
what else

07:08.887 --> 07:10.138
to say!

07:10.180 --> 07:13.934
I mean, I really like Riley,
but do I want to get serious?

07:13.975 --> 07:15.435
Guess I'll have to decide

07:15.476 --> 07:17.729
before he gets back
from his family vacation.

07:17.771 --> 07:21.608
Uh, Annie...

07:21.649 --> 07:24.403
Riley's not on family vacation.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.865
Yeah, um, a few days ago,
a trainer told me

07:28.907 --> 07:31.993
that Riley went out
to the San Jose Spinal Center

07:32.035 --> 07:33.453
to get experimental surgery.

07:33.494 --> 07:35.747
What?! Why didn't you tell me?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.749
You were kind of busy
getting shot.
(scoffs)

07:37.791 --> 07:41.336
And plus, I didn't know it had
anything to do with you at all.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.546
Look, around Christmas,
Riley was worried

07:43.588 --> 07:45.548
that you weren't taking
the relationship seriously

07:45.590 --> 07:46.800
because of his handicap.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.885
And I basically told
him that was true

07:48.927 --> 07:51.263
when I said I didn't
know how I felt.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.472
Oh, my God.

07:52.513 --> 07:54.557
(sighs)

07:56.935 --> 07:59.313
Please pick up.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.440
Damn it...

08:03.608 --> 08:06.236
San Jose Spinal Center?

08:06.278 --> 08:09.114
Hi. Riley Wallace, please.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.366
He's already
prepping for surgery.

08:11.408 --> 08:14.244
Well, uh, th-this is...

08:14.286 --> 08:16.955
Melinda from his
insurance company,

08:16.997 --> 08:19.833
and we're having difficulty
processing his claim,

08:19.874 --> 08:21.960
and we can't
authorize the surgery,

08:22.002 --> 08:23.170
so can you just tell him

08:23.211 --> 08:25.630
to hang tight for a
couple days? Thank you.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.216
Annie, did you just lie
to a hospital?

08:28.258 --> 08:30.344
He can't do this
until I talk to him.

08:30.385 --> 08:31.345
Let's go.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.888
You're driving me
to San Jose.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.224
(groans quietly
in pain)

08:53.950 --> 08:56.453
MAN:
Hey, congratulations.

08:56.495 --> 08:57.662
The bag's dead.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.247
Had a rough couple of days.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.166
I'm just trying
to work off some stress.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.626
Seen you a lot this week.
You don't talk much.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.254
I'm not here to talk.
I'm here to hit stuff.
You ever

09:06.296 --> 09:08.131
think about hitting something
that actually hits back?

09:08.173 --> 09:09.883
All the time.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.843
Well, I got a fighter that
could use a sparring partner.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.011
If you're comfortable
getting in the ring,

09:13.053 --> 09:15.180
I'll pair you up.
Yeah, absolutely.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.764
Rules are simple.

09:16.806 --> 09:17.891
Rounds start and end
with the bell.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.600
No knocks
to the head or the groin.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.769
Carlos has a big match later
and needs an easy warm-up.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.271
Now, we're working on
holding down his left,

09:23.313 --> 09:26.274
so I want you to throw
low and right when you can.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.650
Here we go, Carlos.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.738
Touch gloves,
fighters.

09:31.779 --> 09:34.699
(bell rings)

09:37.494 --> 09:38.495
Good.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.877
Keep it low.
That's good. Good.

09:46.836 --> 09:47.670
That a boy.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.630
Good. Keep it low.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.758
Keep it low!

09:51.799 --> 09:52.884
That a boy.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.220
Keep moving.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.186
Watch your head!
Watch your head!

10:03.228 --> 10:05.439
(grunts)

10:05.480 --> 10:06.898
Hey!

10:08.858 --> 10:10.277
What the hell were you thinking?

10:10.318 --> 10:12.820
I don't know.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.864
(speaking quietly)

10:17.367 --> 10:19.411
(panting)

10:22.705 --> 10:25.584
(theme music playing)

10:41.349 --> 10:42.392
I was just throwing punches

10:42.434 --> 10:43.393
trying not to get hit too hard.

10:43.435 --> 10:45.645
Before I knew it,
the guy on his ass.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.897
I mean, I feel bad
for flooring him, but...

10:47.939 --> 10:49.399
man, it felt good.

10:49.441 --> 10:50.691
Sounds like a better
outlet for anger

10:50.733 --> 10:51.692
than hitting tennis balls.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.487
Oh, am I glad
to see you guys.

10:53.528 --> 10:55.280
All these business
school prerequisites.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.115
Man, that last
class was brutal.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.366
Couldn't have
been any worse

10:58.408 --> 11:00.243
than my conversation
with Silver this morning.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.787
Ah, sorry, man, spare
us the details.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.831
Silver's our friend, too,
and things tend to get

11:04.872 --> 11:08.084
a little complicated in
the Silver baby situation.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.003
We're Switzerland.
We remain neutral.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.296
Well, I don't
blame you guys

11:11.338 --> 11:12.755
for wanting
to stay out of it.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.466
The whole situation
is a nightmare.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.635
Well, hey, if hitting
tennis balls doesn't help,

11:16.675 --> 11:18.428
join me at the
gym sometime.

11:18.470 --> 11:19.929
Speaking of which, I got to run.

11:19.971 --> 11:20.930
See you guys later.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.432
He's pretty chipper for a guy

11:22.474 --> 11:24.683
who was almost shipped
to Mexico in a crate.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.811
Man, I wish my life
looked so good.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.396
I'm trying to
make a comeback,

11:28.438 --> 11:30.023
after dropping
out of Princeton.

11:30.064 --> 11:32.192
Oh, so I applied
for the honors business program,

11:32.233 --> 11:33.943
Mm-hmm.
but they don't accept

11:33.985 --> 11:34.944
applications mid-semester.

11:34.986 --> 11:36.279
Uh, so without
some serious pull,

11:36.321 --> 11:40.200
my chances of getting
in pretty much suck.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.576
MAN:
Teddy Montgomery.

11:41.618 --> 11:44.454
No way. I didn't
know you were back

11:44.496 --> 11:45.664
on this coast, man.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.290
Campbell Price.
Hey, this is Navid Shirazi.

11:47.332 --> 11:48.625
What's up?
Hey.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.084
Campbell was

11:50.126 --> 11:52.420
an old classmate of mine
from boarding school.
"Classmate"?

11:52.462 --> 11:53.630
That's cold, Monty.

11:53.672 --> 11:55.382
We were partners in crime and,

11:55.423 --> 11:57.842
according to the Dean
of Students, "total asses."

11:57.884 --> 11:59.594
Which I still
don't think

11:59.636 --> 12:01.429
is very nice thing
to call the two guys

12:01.471 --> 12:03.390
who sent a stripper
to your mom's funeral, but...

12:03.431 --> 12:04.891
Ah, the good old days.
Uh-huh.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.976
Hey, I'm head of Cronus now.

12:07.018 --> 12:09.563
You should come to
our next meeting.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.147
Actually, I'm just in town
visiting friends, so...

12:11.189 --> 12:12.607
Mm. Too bad.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.775
We're about to sacrifice
a virgin.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.819
(laughs)
I'm kidding.

12:16.861 --> 12:17.945

12:17.987 --> 12:19.155
Yeah.
(laughs)

12:19.197 --> 12:20.781
All right, man, good seeing you.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.158
Good seeing you, too.
No!

12:22.200 --> 12:23.284
That's the Cronus Society.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.036
Well, that's that
secret elite group.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.371
Well, basically the, uh,
west coast version

12:26.413 --> 12:27.414
of Skull and Bones.

12:27.455 --> 12:28.540
Exactly.
A bunch of douchey guys

12:28.582 --> 12:30.083
using their connections
to get ahead.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.668
Man.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.420
That's exactly what I need.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.464
What?
Later.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.717
Late-later.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.885
DIXON:
Okay, so, look, I'll be back
tomorrow night, okay?

12:40.927 --> 12:42.470
I need you to unlock

12:42.512 --> 12:43.471
the door for the sound mixer--

12:43.513 --> 12:44.972
oh, and if Ade has any gigs,

12:45.014 --> 12:47.100
just tag along, rep the label.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.309
It's glorified baby-sitting.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.103
(laughs)
There is nothing "glorified"

12:50.144 --> 12:51.730
about baby-sitting
your ex-girlfriend.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.064
She hates me.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.483
Is this some elaborate trick
to get me to work for you?

12:55.525 --> 12:56.526
No, no! Not at--

look, I know you won't
take any favors,

12:58.612 --> 12:59.487

12:59.529 --> 13:01.197

Megan.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.407
Please?
Fine.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.866
Only as a favor.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.493
I'll see you when you get back.

13:05.535 --> 13:07.161

But, I guess just
like everyone else,

you don't want me to.

when I first got
into my accident,

13:26.389 --> 13:29.808
you broke down a wall in
my house and moved in, okay?

13:29.850 --> 13:33.313
Wh-When I was addicted,
you paid for my rehab.

13:33.354 --> 13:34.230

13:34.272 --> 13:35.482
let me do anything
for you, Annie?

13:35.523 --> 13:37.442
So, what, you're mad
at me for helping?

13:37.484 --> 13:40.695
I'm not mad at you.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.363

to leave Los Angeles,

barely started dating,

(sighs) Okay, what do
you need me to do?

17:26.003 --> 17:27.881
Just sing one teensy
little song with them,

17:27.922 --> 17:29.215
and I promise,
I will owe you one.

17:29.256 --> 17:30.466
Am I even
being paid for this?

17:30.508 --> 17:32.593
I'm sorry, but I can't
let Adrianna work

17:32.635 --> 17:33.928
for less than her
standard rate.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.722
Plus the added
risk of contact

17:35.763 --> 17:37.348
with germy little
"prostitots"?

17:37.390 --> 17:39.517
We'll need hazard pay.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.685
That's not really my call.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.436
You can speak

Cronus isn't really

I wasn't expecting her to go
crazy and call the clinic.

24:29.927 --> 24:32.305

24:32.346 --> 24:33.639
kind of irresistible.

24:33.680 --> 24:37.851

Okay, yes, your sister
went temporarily insane,

24:37.893 --> 24:39.686
but she did it
for the right reasons, you know?

24:39.728 --> 24:40.938
She thought that her...

24:40.980 --> 24:42.898
incredibly handsome boyfriend
was gonna bite the bullet,

24:42.940 --> 24:45.109
so, sometimes
in situations like these,

24:45.151 --> 24:47.694
the ends justify the means.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.989

the established conglomerate?

25:38.245 --> 25:39.955

was whether or not

the fridge for Navid's party,

satisfaction out of seeing

25:57.597 --> 26:00.267
how many ways tiny Liam
can kill these aliens.
Mm.

26:00.309 --> 26:01.394
You want to play?

26:01.435 --> 26:02.686
Yeah.

26:02.728 --> 26:05.022
Don't-don't use the fire hose--
it's a trap.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.940

Man, this is fun.

26:17.701 --> 26:19.537

time writing this game,

26:19.577 --> 26:21.705
I never actually
got the chance to...

26:21.747 --> 26:24.166
try the final product.
Yeah, well,

26:24.208 --> 26:26.835
sure beats polishing your résumé

26:30.339 --> 26:32.091
You're absolutely right.

26:32.132 --> 26:34.051
Dude. Dude, dude, d...
(groans)

26:34.093 --> 26:35.802
You let the oracle die.

26:35.844 --> 26:37.388
I'm sorry. Here. Here.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.098
You're better at it.

26:39.139 --> 26:40.057
I got to go.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.267
Yeah.

26:41.308 --> 26:42.351
(sighs)

26:43.310 --> 26:46.397
Ade, you will enter stage left,

26:46.439 --> 26:49.483
and that will be right after
the cotton candy clouds part.

26:49.525 --> 26:50.817
Sounds great.

26:50.859 --> 26:53.195
Not as great as Tokyo, but
that little girl is probably

26:53.237 --> 26:55.448
a sad, lonely wretch who hasn't
gone on a date in months.

26:55.489 --> 26:56.407
What? Who?

26:56.449 --> 26:57.657
What? No one.

26:57.699 --> 26:58.825
Huh?

26:58.867 --> 27:02.620
Oh. The juice boxes
need restocking. Yay.

27:02.662 --> 27:04.915
MEGAN:
Oh, yes.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.625
Thank you so much.

27:07.667 --> 27:09.711
Good news?
I just got a scholarship

27:09.753 --> 27:11.589
that will cover my tuition
for next semester.

27:11.629 --> 27:13.757
I was this close
to selling fries, like you,

27:13.799 --> 27:15.926
except from behind the cash
register with a tacky

27:15.968 --> 27:17.136
polyester uniform.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.597
Not that you care. At all.

27:19.637 --> 27:22.516
Sorry. Uh, sound check's
in 45 minutes.

27:22.558 --> 27:23.850
Thanks.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.311
And congratulations.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.146
The scholarship sounds great.

27:27.187 --> 27:28.355
Thank you.

27:28.397 --> 27:30.399
And...

27:30.441 --> 27:32.526
I'm sorry I have been
such a bitch.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.111
What happened
with me and Dixon

27:34.153 --> 27:35.404
has nothing to do
with you.

27:35.446 --> 27:39.533
I know it sounds weird coming
from his ex-girlfriend...

27:39.575 --> 27:41.535
but you're actually pretty cool.

27:41.577 --> 27:43.120
Thanks.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.623
You're not so bad yourself.

27:48.708 --> 27:50.586
(knocking on door)
Come in.

27:50.628 --> 27:52.670
We need to talk.

27:54.381 --> 27:56.925
(chuckles)
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

27:56.967 --> 27:58.844
I didn't realize
this Cronus Society thing

27:58.885 --> 28:00.220
meant so much to you.

28:00.262 --> 28:02.680
I'll call Campbell and put
in a good word for you.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.391
Yeah, that's, um,
not why I'm here.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.810
Do you have any idea
what Silver's going through?

28:06.852 --> 28:08.521
No, and I don't care.

28:08.562 --> 28:10.814
She's lucky I'm not dragging
her ass to court.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.483
She's your best
friend, Teddy.

28:12.525 --> 28:14.109
Do you really think
she would've forged those forms

28:14.151 --> 28:15.986
if it wasn't her last chance
at getting pregnant?

28:16.028 --> 28:17.613
What are you talking about?

28:19.490 --> 28:22.409
Silver can't have
any more babies, okay?

28:22.451 --> 28:25.703
If you do this, she'll-she'll
never have kids of her own.

28:25.745 --> 28:27.789
Hey, I get
that you're mad,

28:27.831 --> 28:30.708
but if you still go through with
this, what you'll do to her...

28:30.750 --> 28:32.836
is so much worse.

Yeah.

28:53.482 --> 28:56.193
I, uh... I figured out
what I want to do with my life.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.986
Liam and I were playing
the Corporate Invaders game,

28:58.028 --> 29:00.780
and it was fun; it was the kind
of fun that I haven't had

29:00.822 --> 29:03.450
in a year-- I mean, not since
I-I gave up my whole life

29:03.492 --> 29:05.202
to-to think
about stocks and mergers.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.162
Well, we both gave up things
that were important to us, Max.

29:07.204 --> 29:09.915
Yeah, but why?
Did we have to? I mean...

29:09.956 --> 29:11.791
I mean, I used to love working,

29:11.833 --> 29:14.044
when I was in my dorm room
writing code

29:14.086 --> 29:15.295
because I wanted to,

29:15.337 --> 29:17.423
not because the-the shareholders
needed a product.

29:17.464 --> 29:19.383
What... So what are you saying?
You want to go back to Caltech?

29:19.425 --> 29:22.010
N-No-- MIT has
this amazing program

29:22.052 --> 29:23.887
I've always wanted
to be a part of and...

29:23.929 --> 29:25.639
and they're willing
to take me mid-semester.

29:25.681 --> 29:27.807
MIT?
Yeah.

29:27.849 --> 29:30.310
That's what you figured out?
Yeah.

29:30.352 --> 29:34.189
That's what I was giving you
all this space for? That is...

29:34.231 --> 29:35.857
That's the grand life plan?!

29:35.899 --> 29:37.984
How can you be mad that I want
to go back to school?

29:38.026 --> 29:39.278

29:39.319 --> 29:41.029
You don't want to go back
to school! You want to...

29:41.071 --> 29:43.031
You want to go back to
hanging out in your dorm room!

29:43.073 --> 29:45.451
You want to go back to exactly
the way your life was

29:45.492 --> 29:46.368
before you married me!

29:46.410 --> 29:48.328
That is not true.
Yes, it is.

29:48.370 --> 29:49.538
That's why you ran off,

29:49.580 --> 29:51.248
and went and hid out
at your mother's house

29:51.290 --> 29:53.500
because you're acting
like a child, Max!
A child?!

29:53.542 --> 29:56.920
Yes, a child!
I'm surrounded by children!

29:56.962 --> 29:58.464
If I'm acting
like a child,

29:58.505 --> 30:00.173
it's because
you're treating me like one.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.008
Oh, my God!

30:02.050 --> 30:03.927
Hey, hey, thanks

Maybe you can cut the crusts
off my sandwiches, too.
You know what?

I am sick and tired of thinking
about what Max wants.

What am I supposed
to do there, huh?

30:13.353 --> 30:14.772
Plan pilgrim dinners?

30:14.813 --> 30:16.774
I don't want to go there
with you, Max!

30:16.856 --> 30:18.317
I don't want to go there!

30:18.358 --> 30:21.987
I want to go to Tokyo,

I didn't ask him to talk to you

he said to... change your mind.

32:10.679 --> 32:11.930
You shouldn't.

If I could find a way
to go through with this

32:24.484 --> 32:27.404
so I would never have
to see you again, I would.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.782
But as much
as I hate you right now,

I figured you deserve to be
the one to present it to Dixon.

a check for $15,000.

What?

33:24.419 --> 33:26.463
How is that possible?

33:26.505 --> 33:29.382
We just got paid
for that fast food jingle.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.806
No, thank you.

33:47.233 --> 33:50.069
ends with the new guy
getting his ass kicked.

33:50.111 --> 33:52.614
Like the cloak and
paddle routine?

33:52.656 --> 33:56.201
That's not
really our thing.

33:56.242 --> 33:57.911
Well, maybe this will be
your thing.

33:57.953 --> 33:59.705

opportunity.

34:59.472 --> 35:01.224
You're back.
Yep.

35:01.266 --> 35:04.436
So, uh...
how'd everything go?

35:04.477 --> 35:06.271
It was great, actually.

35:06.312 --> 35:08.648
Turns out, Ade and I make
kind of a good team.

35:08.690 --> 35:10.233
Mm! So, uh, does that mean

35:10.275 --> 35:11.443
you're reconsidering
working for me?

35:11.484 --> 35:13.028
Not necessary.

The financial aid
office called.

35:15.030 --> 35:18.283

came through and I got it.

35:18.324 --> 35:19.367

35:19.409 --> 35:21.912
Wow, th-that's great, babe!
Congratulations.

35:23.580 --> 35:26.041
Hey, I was just telling Dixon
how great you were up there.

35:26.083 --> 35:27.584
Yeah, not as good
as you were.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.252
Tricking me into thinking
we were friends

35:29.294 --> 35:31.713
so I'd humiliate myself
for your tuition money?

35:31.755 --> 35:33.298
W-What?

35:33.339 --> 35:34.507
Yeah, what are you
talking about?

35:34.549 --> 35:35.467
I worked my ass off,

35:35.508 --> 35:37.510
and you used that
money to set up

35:37.552 --> 35:39.638
a scholarship for
your girlfriend.

35:39.679 --> 35:40.973
