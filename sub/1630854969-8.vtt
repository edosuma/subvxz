Previously
on "Gotham Knights"...

00:02.377 --> 00:03.128
We've been set up.

00:03.128 --> 00:04.754
Turner: We're gonna
find who really
killed my dad

00:04.754 --> 00:06.506
and clear our names.

00:06.506 --> 00:07.716
Stephanie: Turner, you need to
get out of there right now.

00:07.716 --> 00:09.175
Cressida is one of them.

00:09.175 --> 00:10.719
She's working
with the Court of Owls.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.387
The Court killed my dad,

00:12.387 --> 00:13.680
and now they're
trying to kill me.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.474
Duela: And what
the Mutants take,

00:16.474 --> 00:18.435
we taketh away.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.270
Harper:
It's a Court of Owls watch.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.438
So is this one.

00:21.438 --> 00:22.856
Hello.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.232
Harvey: Why did I wake up
with no memory

00:24.232 --> 00:25.734
of how I got there?

00:25.734 --> 00:28.695
Eunice: When I was
young, I would attend

00:28.695 --> 00:31.489
the most elegant parties
the Court would throw.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.825
We always wore masks.
Ha ha ha!

00:33.825 --> 00:35.618
Stephanie: Every painting
that was taken was owned

00:35.618 --> 00:37.370
by Alan Wayne
at the time of his death,

00:37.370 --> 00:40.165
and who do we know that's
interested in all things
Alan Wayne?

00:40.165 --> 00:41.624
The Court of Owls.

00:41.624 --> 00:43.418
It can't be just
a painting.

00:43.418 --> 00:44.544
The hell are you
doing here?

00:44.544 --> 00:46.254
I need your help.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.881
My life is in danger.

00:51.468 --> 00:52.886
As promised.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.740
- Whoa.
- Yep.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.075
Turner: There's enough
firepower in here

01:15.075 --> 01:16.576
to arm every
criminal in Gotham.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.787
I think that's their plan.

01:27.629 --> 01:28.880
What are you doing?

01:28.880 --> 01:31.382
Just so the cops
know who to thank.

01:31.382 --> 01:33.426
Cullen should be
here by now.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.136
Relax. He'll be here.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.016
Harper, I don't think
he's coming.

01:40.016 --> 01:41.142
He'll be here.

01:41.142 --> 01:44.145
[Sirens]

01:44.145 --> 01:46.439
OK. Maybe not.

01:46.439 --> 01:49.109

Come on.

I could find. Let's go.

Cullen: My watch stopped.

02:12.423 --> 02:13.883
What do you mean,
it stopped?

02:13.883 --> 02:15.593
As in it stopped working.
I don't know.

02:15.593 --> 02:17.137
Isn't that one of those
insanely expensive

02:17.137 --> 02:18.596
Court of Owls watches?

02:18.596 --> 02:19.973
You could throw that thing
in a volcano,

02:19.973 --> 02:21.349
and it's supposed
to keep ticking.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.725
Yeah, that's
what I thought, too,

02:22.725 --> 02:23.726
but apparently quality
timepieces are hard

02:23.726 --> 02:25.311
to come by these days.

02:25.311 --> 02:28.064
Duela: I guess nobody cares
about craftsmanship anymore.

02:28.064 --> 02:30.275
Harper: Yeah, well,
next time, find a new one.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.818
Otherwise, we end up
behind bars.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.112
I'm way ahead of you.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.072
Carrie: That's one more
in the win column.

02:36.072 --> 02:38.241
We could bust up every
low-level criminal front

02:38.241 --> 02:40.952
in this thing and still
not get any closer
to finding the Court.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.704
But at least we got
a bunch of illegal guns

02:42.704 --> 02:44.581
off the streets,
you know, made the city

02:44.581 --> 02:46.040
and the Narrows safer.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.667
Duela: Well, that's
really great for you

02:47.667 --> 02:49.335
and the upstanding
citizens of Gotham,

02:49.335 --> 02:51.004
but the rest of us here
are still wanted fugitives.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.548
So maybe instead of
pretending to be heroes,

02:53.548 --> 02:55.049
you could all be
more focused on,

02:55.049 --> 02:56.676
let's say it
all together now...

02:56.676 --> 02:58.344
All: Clearing our names.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.972
Harper: We know.
What do you think
we are trying to do?

03:00.972 --> 03:02.932
Duela: OK. Then tell me
why we just handed over

03:02.932 --> 03:04.642
that painting that
the Court was so desperate

03:04.642 --> 03:06.102
to get their hands on.

03:06.102 --> 03:07.854
We could have used that
to find out who they are

03:07.854 --> 03:09.898
because if we had names,
we would know who to target,

03:09.898 --> 03:12.358
but instead, any leverage
we might have had,

03:12.358 --> 03:13.776
we just gave away,

03:13.776 --> 03:15.445
all to save
that cop's family.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.530
- We didn't have a choice.
- No, there's always a choice.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.073
We just made a bad one.

gonna want to see this.

03:22.118 --> 03:24.621
Look.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.122
Your broken Court
of Owls Watch?

03:26.122 --> 03:29.542
Nope. That's my broken
Court of Owls Watch.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.462
So is this. So is that.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.130
Notice anything?

03:38.134 --> 03:39.636
Harper: Whoa!

03:42.305 --> 03:43.681
Turner: Whoa.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.813
I don't think
they're broken at all.

03:50.813 --> 03:53.149
I think they're
working perfectly.

03:55.109 --> 03:58.696
Yeah, but doing what?

04:17.340 --> 04:20.969
Is this a safe house
or a drug den?

04:20.969 --> 04:22.887
Well, it's discreet,

04:22.887 --> 04:24.430
and for someone whose
other options are

04:24.430 --> 04:25.932
behind bars
or in the ground,

04:25.932 --> 04:28.017
I'd say this is
a step up.

04:28.017 --> 04:30.019
The Court's not going
to find you here.

04:30.019 --> 04:32.230

alive to talk?

I need you to do a lot
more than talk.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.442
I need names,
and I need proof.

And I need full immunity
and an order

not the GCPD.

and if they find out
I'm about to talk,

they will kill us both.

yourself too much.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.159
Uh, two seconds.

06:50.159 --> 06:56.290
OK. So all 4 watches stop
simultaneously in a cycle of 3,

06:56.290 --> 06:58.084
displaying the same
3 times of day.

06:58.084 --> 07:03.047
7:21 a.m., 3:05 p.m.,
and 9 p.m. on the dot.

07:03.047 --> 07:05.299
OK. So what's so special
about those times of day?

07:05.299 --> 07:06.717
Turner: You can bet
the Court knows.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.261
There's no way that's
a coincidence.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.637
No way it's good.

07:09.637 --> 07:11.180

planning something bad

07:11.180 --> 07:12.932
to go down at each time
on the watches.

finding the Court was

07:30.324 --> 07:31.993
"Watches all the time."

07:31.993 --> 07:33.327
It was a rumor he heard,

07:33.327 --> 07:34.620
but he didn't know
what it meant.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.122
He just kept repeating
the same part

07:36.122 --> 07:37.665
of the rhyme over and over.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.459
What if it means the key
to finding the Court of Owls

07:39.459 --> 07:41.419
are the watches they
give their members?

07:41.419 --> 07:42.920
Like, each time is
part of a code.

07:42.920 --> 07:46.924
It's not just a time.
It's a place.

07:46.924 --> 07:48.801
One of them is a time,
9 p.m. on the dot,

07:48.801 --> 07:51.345
and the other two
are 7:21 and 2 seconds

07:51.345 --> 07:54.390
and 3:05 and 13 seconds.

07:54.390 --> 07:56.476
Pretty random
unless it's not a time

07:56.476 --> 07:58.394
and it's actually
a latitude and longitude.

07:58.394 --> 08:00.521
A bunch of busted watches
told you that?

08:00.521 --> 08:02.148
- Sounds like a leap.
- Yeah, and a damn good one.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.858
Let her finish.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.776
Uh, latitude and longitude
are expressed

08:05.776 --> 08:07.445
in degrees,
minutes, and seconds,

08:07.445 --> 08:09.739
so I think the hour hand
is probably degrees.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.699
Minute hand is minutes,
and the second hand
is seconds.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.576
I feel like
I'm watching nerd porn.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.328
So how do we get
latitude and longitude
from those times?

08:15.328 --> 08:16.829
You want the long version
or the short version?

08:16.829 --> 08:18.664
Turner, Duela, and Cullen:
The short version.

08:18.664 --> 08:22.001
Latitude is 39 degrees,
21 minutes, 2 seconds,

08:22.001 --> 08:25.838
and longitude is 75 degrees,
5 minutes, 13 seconds.

where that is.

freaking out again?

08:40.978 --> 08:43.022
Uh, last night, sometime
after midnight.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.398
OK. So technically today.

happening tonight.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.652
What's happening
tonight?

08:47.652 --> 08:49.403
My dad's journals mentioned
that the Court

08:49.403 --> 08:51.155
was rumored to hold
clandestine meetings

08:51.155 --> 08:52.490
in order to
pass along information.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.242
He theorized that they
preferred to do it

08:54.242 --> 08:56.869
in person so that none
of their communications
could be traced.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.621
Not to mention
they're, like,
uber secretive, right?

08:58.621 --> 09:00.248
So they're not exactly
going to send out

09:00.248 --> 09:02.625
save the dates for their
little get-togethers.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.710
How better to make sure
that info only reaches

09:04.710 --> 09:07.713
their members than
by something only
their members have?

09:07.713 --> 09:09.382
OK. Why meet now?

09:09.382 --> 09:11.717
Duela: An art exhibit.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.719
They did just complete
their collection,

09:13.719 --> 09:15.638
so maybe they
want to celebrate.

09:15.638 --> 09:18.266
I mean, it could be one
of those fancy parties

09:18.266 --> 09:21.727

that dear old Eunice
was babbling about.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.063
Whatever it is,
looks like the Court

09:24.063 --> 09:26.399
is having a little soiree tonight,

09:26.399 --> 09:28.276
and we have the address.

09:32.947 --> 09:35.908
Cullen: The old Gotham
Light and Power facility.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.286
It's been decommissioned.
Are you sure that's it?

09:38.286 --> 09:39.495
Harper: It's the only place
in the vicinity

09:39.495 --> 09:40.871
of the coordinates.

09:40.871 --> 09:42.873
Eunice did say the Court
held their parties

09:42.873 --> 09:44.250
in the strangest places.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.919
Well, that
certainly qualifies.

was called in from your
doctor this morning.

- OK.
- He said it was urgent.

letting me know.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.706
Everything's great.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.963
My fellow citizens of Gotham,

10:30.963 --> 10:36.385
a few days ago, I was the victim
of an attempted homicide,

10:36.385 --> 10:38.095
and all of the evidence

10:38.095 --> 10:41.182
points to none other than
the fugitive at large

10:41.182 --> 10:44.060
Turner Hayes
as the primary suspect,

10:44.060 --> 10:47.688
and, yes, he is still
at large.

10:47.688 --> 10:49.565
There are many
unanswered questions

10:49.565 --> 10:53.319
to this brutal assault,
but I only have one.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.738
Where is Harvey Dent?

10:57.281 --> 10:58.741
Mr. Dent, you're back.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.202
- I've been calling you.
- Personal matters.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.745
I'm here now.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.497
You've already missed
the city council meeting,

11:04.497 --> 11:05.831
and now you're
20 minutes late

11:05.831 --> 11:07.083
to the campaign
finance review.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.751
Yes, I know. Thank you.

11:10.294 --> 11:13.547
Sorry. It's been a day.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.341
Can you get me
Judge Stevens on the phone?

11:15.341 --> 11:17.134
I need to ask him
for a plea deal.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.470
For whom?

11:19.470 --> 11:21.847
Just get him
on the phone.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.524
Harper: You seriously
want to infiltrate
the Court of Owls' lair?

11:31.524 --> 11:33.275
Turner: Not sure it's
actually a lair,

11:33.275 --> 11:35.277
but I'm not sure
we actually have a choice.

11:35.277 --> 11:37.238
Cullen: Do you know how
insane that sounds?

11:37.238 --> 11:39.198
I mean, we might as well
just chop off our own heads
and get it over with.

11:39.198 --> 11:42.201
Turner: We've been waiting
for an opportunity like this.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.494
We have the watches.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.662
We can just wait for
the next meeting,

11:44.662 --> 11:46.080
get ourselves
better prepared.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.290
And what if there is
no next time?

11:48.290 --> 11:50.418
We have no idea how
often the Court meets,

11:50.418 --> 11:53.546
and Eunice said they
never meet in the same
place twice, right?

11:53.546 --> 11:56.716
This is our chance.
We can't wait.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.884
If we can get inside,
we might be able to find out

11:58.884 --> 12:00.720
the identity
of the Court members

12:00.720 --> 12:01.887
and expose them,

12:01.887 --> 12:03.347
maybe even get
more information

12:03.347 --> 12:04.849
about that painting
they were jonesing

12:04.849 --> 12:06.225
to get their hands on.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.810
Look, this is the best
shot we've ever had

12:07.810 --> 12:11.856
at ending all of this,
and we have to take it.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.441
I'm done being afraid.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.526
Sounds like you're
done being alive.

12:15.526 --> 12:17.570
We're talking about
going into the belly
of the beast.

12:17.570 --> 12:21.574
Exactly. That's
the thing about owls.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.659
They have
no natural predators.

12:23.659 --> 12:25.870
They don't know what it's
like to be hunted,

12:25.870 --> 12:29.415
which means they won't
see us coming.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.834
And how exactly do you
plan to manage that?

12:31.834 --> 12:33.836
Duela: I think I know how.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.090
We dress to impress.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.384
OK. Only problem is
we don't have masks.

12:40.384 --> 12:42.678
Does Gotham Academy
have a 3D printer?

12:43.929 --> 12:45.639
In the arts lab.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.728
I can use these
as reference.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.646
I'm pretty sure
I can print out

12:52.646 --> 12:54.231
exact replicas
of these masks.

12:54.231 --> 12:56.525
- It's brilliant.
- No, it's a long shot.

12:56.525 --> 12:58.319
This owl soiree starts
in just a few hours,

12:58.319 --> 13:00.279
which means...

13:00.279 --> 13:04.074
I maybe have enough time
to make two masks.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.534
So...

You heard Lincoln
on the news?

13:25.471 --> 13:27.890
Yeah. He's coming down on me
a little harder than usual.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.558
I think he knows.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.562
- How?
- I'm not sure.

13:33.562 --> 13:36.190
His spies
are everywhere.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.650
We should never have
risked it.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.527
No, no. Maybe it's good
that we did.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.071

of him the press
doesn't see, Harvey.

a dangerous man.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.082
I'm getting you out
of there.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.917

14:03.759 --> 14:05.845
Go in, get
as much intel as we can,

14:05.845 --> 14:07.513
and get out.

for this?

You? Not so much.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.287
Well, don't get it twisted.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.914
Those with privilege
are no more

15:14.914 --> 15:17.499
than glorified con artists
whose superpower is

15:17.499 --> 15:19.084
tricking people
into believing

15:19.084 --> 15:22.338
they're more deserving
and better than the rest of us.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.841
I'm familiar
with the type.

I actually learned

15:31.096 --> 15:33.974

in Gotham.

She's, uh--she's
been in Arkham
since I popped out.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.821
By the time
the authorities
caught her,

15:47.821 --> 15:49.782
she had taken on
so many identities

15:49.782 --> 15:52.326
that they didn't know
who she really was.

Neither did she,
I guess.

23:36.498 --> 23:38.417
Figured there had to be
a reason they wanted

23:38.417 --> 23:39.709
that crappy old painting.

23:39.709 --> 23:41.420
It wasn't
a painting at all.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.673
Soon we will have that which
we have sought for so long,

23:44.673 --> 23:46.591
that which we have
spent decades

23:46.591 --> 23:49.719
of blood and treasure to find--

23:49.719 --> 23:51.304
electrum.

23:51.304 --> 23:53.432
[Applause]

23:55.642 --> 23:57.018
What the hell is electrum?

23:57.018 --> 23:59.521
And once we have it
in our possession,

23:59.521 --> 24:02.566
we will reach heights
those who came before us

24:02.566 --> 24:04.109
dared only dream of.

24:04.109 --> 24:07.070
We will achieve
our greatest triumph of all--

24:07.070 --> 24:09.906
mastery over death.

24:09.906 --> 24:12.784
We will no longer suffer
the ravages of time,

24:12.784 --> 24:15.745
and as the world ages
all around us,

24:15.745 --> 24:17.414
we will stand impervious to that

24:17.414 --> 24:20.542
which would make us
wither and decay.

24:20.542 --> 24:23.712
We shall live forever.

24:23.712 --> 24:27.424
[Applause]

[Door opens and shuts]

24:44.191 --> 24:46.651
Caught you red-handed.

24:48.528 --> 24:50.655
Or should I say
empty-handed?

24:50.655 --> 24:53.366
Mom, didn't think
you'd be up.

24:53.366 --> 24:56.411
Your curfew isn't
a suggestion.

24:56.411 --> 24:59.498
I was with Dad
at the studio.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.082
You know,
people always tell me

25:01.082 --> 25:04.461
that you two are each
other's spitting image.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.922
As a baby, I always thought
you'd take after me,

25:06.922 --> 25:09.841
but you ended up
a daddy's girl.

25:09.841 --> 25:13.053
My mother was right.

25:13.053 --> 25:15.514
A man's only true love

25:15.514 --> 25:18.183
will always be
his daughter.

25:18.183 --> 25:21.853
You're not supposed to
drink on your medication.

25:21.853 --> 25:24.814
I've been taking this
a long time.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.441
I know my limits.

25:26.441 --> 25:28.193
OK. Let's just go to bed, OK?

25:28.193 --> 25:30.695
No. Hey, Stephanie. No.

25:30.695 --> 25:33.281
Don't try to manage me.

25:36.618 --> 25:38.078
Where did you
get those?

25:38.078 --> 25:39.746
The pharmacy.

25:39.746 --> 25:42.707
You know what?
I take you to how many
fencing tournaments,

25:42.707 --> 25:45.252
and you can't even run
one little errand for--

25:45.252 --> 25:46.503
I meant who
prescribed them?

25:46.503 --> 25:49.297
- A doctor.
- Oh, God.

25:49.297 --> 25:51.341
This new pain specialist
that I'm seeing--

25:51.341 --> 25:52.592
Who treats
a prescription pad

25:52.592 --> 25:53.885
like they're
sticky notes.

25:53.885 --> 25:56.721
It's medication, sweetie.

25:56.721 --> 25:59.849
Doctor shopping
isn't hard when
you've got the cash.

25:59.849 --> 26:01.476
Heh heh heh!

26:01.476 --> 26:03.562
Well, then,
thank God for your father.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.188
- It isn't funny.
- You know, I think

26:05.188 --> 26:06.606
if I was doing
something wrong,

26:06.606 --> 26:08.650
they would have shut me up
in Blackgate by now.

26:08.650 --> 26:12.112
Have you ever thought
about how it affects me,

26:12.112 --> 26:14.197
having to carry
my own mother out

26:14.197 --> 26:15.615
of a parents' luncheon?

26:15.615 --> 26:16.741
People were staring.

26:16.741 --> 26:19.953
They always watch us

26:19.953 --> 26:21.204
and your father.

26:21.204 --> 26:22.664
If it weren't
for his career,

26:22.664 --> 26:24.249
you wouldn't even be able
to go to that school.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.751
We owe it to him to
always show our best,

26:26.751 --> 26:31.256
and I can't do that
if I am hurting.

26:32.507 --> 26:34.801
Are you even
in pain anymore?

26:38.722 --> 26:40.724
I gave birth to you.

26:40.724 --> 26:45.270
Don't you dare talk
to me about pain.

26:49.232 --> 26:51.151
S-S-Stephanie!

Harper: Electrum.

27:48.083 --> 27:49.834
It's got to be
the stuff Eunice
was talking about.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.795
She specifically said
that the Court gave

27:51.795 --> 27:53.380
the Talon a special substance

27:53.380 --> 27:54.673
that increases lifespan.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.424
How is stuff like that
even possible?

27:56.424 --> 27:58.301
You can always ask
our 130-year-old Talon

27:58.301 --> 28:00.053
- the next time you see him.
- Great.

28:00.053 --> 28:03.014
So we have a murderous cult
that wants to be
murderous forever.

28:03.014 --> 28:06.267
Oh, hold on.
I got something.

28:06.267 --> 28:08.478
It's not much, though,
just a blog referencing

28:08.478 --> 28:10.855
a "Gotham Gazette" article
from the twenties.

28:10.855 --> 28:12.357
All right. What does it say?

28:12.357 --> 28:13.817
"A meteorite was
discovered by a scientist

off the streets,

never have dreamed of,

for yourself?

It is true.

I could have wanted--

and in exchange,
I lied...

36:17.383 --> 36:18.885
I was going to expose them.

36:18.885 --> 36:21.846
I reached out to Harvey,
but somehow they found me.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.599
Why would you do that?

36:24.599 --> 36:28.186
Because of what I did
to your father...

36:28.186 --> 36:29.687
to you.

36:29.687 --> 36:31.772
Guilt is a parasite
that will eat at your soul

36:31.772 --> 36:34.066
until there's nothing left
but emptiness.

36:35.735 --> 36:37.695
Is that the only reason?

36:37.695 --> 36:39.197
After the last time
I saw you,

36:39.197 --> 36:41.199
I discovered what they
planned to do with electrum.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.825
Turner, if they find it,

36:42.825 --> 36:45.244
they will be a nearly
immortal dynasty

36:45.244 --> 36:48.372
that will rule over Gotham
in perpetuity.

36:48.372 --> 36:50.541
They will continue to
grow fat

36:50.541 --> 36:52.376
off the city's misery
and suffering.

36:52.376 --> 36:56.756
It will never change.
They will never change.

36:58.466 --> 37:01.135
Your father
understood that,

37:01.135 --> 37:04.096
which is why he changed
his will.

37:04.096 --> 37:06.098
What was in it?

37:06.098 --> 37:07.892
What was it that
got him killed?

37:07.892 --> 37:11.395
Your father was
going to give his fortune

37:11.395 --> 37:13.898
to the people of Gotham.

37:13.898 --> 37:16.567
The city's poor would
no longer have to resort

37:16.567 --> 37:18.527
to crime to survive.

37:18.527 --> 37:20.404
Crime thrives on poverty.

37:20.404 --> 37:23.115
The Court thrives on crime.

37:23.115 --> 37:24.408
Bruce wanted to
break that cycle.

37:24.408 --> 37:25.785
The Court couldn't have that.

37:25.785 --> 37:27.411
Then let's do
what he couldn't.

37:27.411 --> 37:28.746
Give me the name
of their leader,

37:28.746 --> 37:30.206
and I'll burn
the Court to the ground.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.458
- It's not that simple.
- I want a name.

37:32.458 --> 37:34.418
[Slice]

37:34.418 --> 37:35.795
[Grunts]

37:37.755 --> 37:39.674
[Thud]

37:41.217 --> 37:43.177
Leader: No!

37:43.177 --> 37:45.346
We have plans
for this one.

37:45.346 --> 37:46.889
[Gasps]

37:49.767 --> 37:51.602
Harper: Turner? Turn--

37:51.602 --> 37:52.728
[Crunch]

37:52.728 --> 37:56.190
Turner?
Can you hear me?

37:56.190 --> 37:57.275
Turner!

37:57.275 --> 37:59.694
[Static]

38:09.287 --> 38:12.164
[Light bulb buzzing]

38:20.798 --> 38:22.049
[Door closes]

38:23.551 --> 38:25.303
She's asleep.

38:29.598 --> 38:31.350
[Sighs]

38:31.350 --> 38:35.479
If I ask you to help
your mother,

38:35.479 --> 38:38.816
you help her.
Understand?

38:38.816 --> 38:41.152
She's out
of control, Dad.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.737
You can't just keep
letting her run--

38:42.737 --> 38:43.946
Yes, I can.

38:44.613 --> 38:49.702
Because you do not
make the decisions
in this family.

38:49.702 --> 38:52.413
Your mother and I do.

38:53.789 --> 38:59.211
I don't think she's capable
of making any decisions.

38:59.211 --> 39:01.213
Look at this place.

39:02.381 --> 39:04.216
Who made her do this?

39:20.941 --> 39:22.193
Duela: OK. We've
got to go back.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.361
We don't even know
where he is.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.029
OK. Then we find him.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.864
No, no.

39:26.864 --> 39:28.657
It's too dangerous.
This place is swarming
with Court.

39:28.657 --> 39:31.035
Going out there now
would be suicide.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.453
Really?

39:33.746 --> 39:35.706
All of a sudden,
the Gotham Knights are

39:35.706 --> 39:37.458
a bunch of cowards?

39:38.084 --> 39:41.379
I'm sorry. I thought you
all wanted to be heroes.

39:41.837 --> 39:44.173
And you? You're supposed
to be his friend.

39:44.173 --> 39:46.384
- I am.
- They are going to kill him!

39:46.384 --> 39:47.802
- No, they're not.
- How do you know that?

39:47.802 --> 39:49.095
Because if they were,
they would have

39:49.095 --> 39:51.055
already done it, Duela!

39:51.055 --> 39:53.057
Cullen: Duela,
you heard that creep.

39:53.057 --> 39:55.351
All right? He needs
him for something.

39:55.351 --> 39:56.727
Carrie: If we go
in there half-cocked,

39:56.727 --> 39:58.562
we're all gonna die,

39:58.562 --> 40:01.524
and if that happens,
they get away
with all of it.

40:01.524 --> 40:04.318
Everything we've done,
everything Turner's done,
all of it for nothing.

40:04.318 --> 40:06.070
OK, so what?
We just run away and hide?

40:06.070 --> 40:09.532
No. We regroup,

40:09.532 --> 40:12.701
we make a plan,
and we live to
fight another day.

40:12.701 --> 40:15.162
Duela, I swear to you
we'll find him.

40:30.970 --> 40:32.388
Take him.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.449
Man: Greg, move your head.
