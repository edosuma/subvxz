11:38.697 --> 11:40.499

11:40.699 --> 11:42.001
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT

FAMILY BAKERY, TIMMY,

12:25.311 --> 12:26.912
WHERE EVERYTHING
IS MAGICALLY DELICIOUS.

12:27.113 --> 12:29.882
YOU CAN EVEN EAT THE WALLS.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.485
- NO, YOU CAN'T, COSMO.

12:32.685 --> 12:35.054
- OH, THEN YOU BETTER TAKE ME
TO THE HOSPITAL.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.656
AHHHH.

12:37.857 --> 12:39.291
- JORGEN, YOU WORK HERE?

12:39.492 --> 12:41.660
- THAT IS RIGHT, TURNER.

12:41.861 --> 12:44.230
YOU SEE, IN ADDITION TO BEING
SUPREME GUARDIAN OF FAIRY WORLD,

12:44.430 --> 12:47.066
I AM ALSO A MINIMUM WAGE STOOGE
AT MY GRANDMOTHER'S BAKERY.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.635
- BOOM! BOOM!

12:53.405 --> 12:55.474
- HARD TO BELIEVE
WE ARE RELATED, HUH?

12:55.674 --> 12:57.810
NANA BOOM BOOM,
THESE ARE MY FRIENDS...

12:58.010 --> 12:59.812
AND TIMMY TURNER.

13:00.012 --> 13:01.914
- YOU WANT TO KICKBOX
FOR A STRUDEL?

13:02.114 --> 13:03.983
- UH, NO, THANKS,
BUT THOSE BROWNIES LOOK GOOD.

13:04.183 --> 13:05.284
DON'T MIND IF I DO.

13:05.484 --> 13:06.852
- HANDS OFF.

13:07.052 --> 13:09.221
- AGH! OHH! UGH!

13:09.421 --> 13:11.991
- THOSE ARE MY AWARD-WINNING
EXTREME FAIRY-CHERRY BROWNIES.

13:12.191 --> 13:14.226
THEY ARE NOT FOR THE CUSTOMERS.

13:14.426 --> 13:16.629
- NANA MADE THEM FOR TOMORROW'S
BIG ANNUAL BAKE-OFF

13:16.829 --> 13:18.797
BETWEEN THE FAIRIES
AND THE ANTI-FAIRIES.

13:18.998 --> 13:21.033
AND BY THE WAY,
THAT IS AN EXPLODING PIE.

13:21.233 --> 13:22.835
[loud explosion]

13:23.035 --> 13:25.538
- POOF-POOF.

13:25.738 --> 13:26.906
MORE.

13:27.106 --> 13:28.073
GOOD.

13:28.274 --> 13:30.643
MOOOORE.

13:30.843 --> 13:33.112
- POOF, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO EAT THOSE.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.047
- OH, COME ON,
THEY CAN'T BE THAT GOOD.

13:38.417 --> 13:39.785
- MOOORE.

13:39.985 --> 13:40.953
GOOD.

13:41.153 --> 13:42.888
MOOOORE.

13:45.424 --> 13:46.792
- AH, HA-HA-HA.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.093
- WE HAVE A BROWNIE BREACH.

13:48.294 --> 13:49.862
- AHH, AH, HA-HA.

13:50.062 --> 13:52.164
AHH-HA-HA.

13:52.364 --> 13:55.668
- AHH, IT IS ANTI-COSMO IN
A CLEVER GIANT CUPCAKE DISGUISE.

13:55.868 --> 13:57.670
- CUPCAKE?

13:57.870 --> 14:00.005
IGNORAMUS,
I'M A GIANT FROSTED SCONE.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.141
AHHHH!

14:05.844 --> 14:07.646
- THAT WAS CLOSE.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.548
IF THAT FIEND HAD ESCAPED
WITH THE BROWNIE,

14:09.748 --> 14:11.817
HE COULD HAVE DECIPHERED
THE RECIPE,

14:12.017 --> 14:13.819
A RECIPE THAT IS KEPT IN
A SECRET VAULT IN THE BASEMENT,

14:14.019 --> 14:15.454
WHICH I GUESS
IS NO LONGER A SECRET,

14:15.654 --> 14:16.722
SINCE I JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT IT.

14:16.922 --> 14:20.059
- DUM-DUM.

14:20.259 --> 14:22.728
- POOF,
THAT WAS THE LAST BROWNIE.

14:22.928 --> 14:25.130
NOW WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE ANOTHER
BATCH FOR THE BAKE-OFF TOMORROW.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.233
[burps]

14:27.433 --> 14:29.702
- I'M GONNA GET POOF
TO A BROWNIE-FREE ZONE.

14:29.902 --> 14:34.039
COSMO, TIMMY, DON'T DO
ANYTHING STUPID WHILE I'M GONE.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.507
- WHY DOES SHE ALWAYS SAY THAT
TO US?

14:35.708 --> 14:37.142
- I DON'T KNOW.

14:37.343 --> 14:39.111
NOW LET'S DO SOMETHING STUPID.

14:39.311 --> 14:40.579
POOF ME UP ANOTHER ONE
OF THOSE BROWNIES

14:40.779 --> 14:42.648
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE.

14:42.848 --> 14:44.883
- SORRY, TIMMY,
THEY'RE MAGIC BROWNIES.

14:45.084 --> 14:47.019
I CAN ONLY POOF THEM UP
BY USING THE SECRET RECIPE.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.454
- THEN TAKE ME DOWN
TO THAT BASEMENT VAULT,

14:48.654 --> 14:50.089
SO I CAN GET THE RECIPE.

14:50.289 --> 14:52.358
- THAT SOUNDS PERFECTLY STUPID.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.193
GETTING THAT BROWNIE RECIPE'S
GONNA BE A PIECE OF CAKE.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.595
WAIT A MINUTE.

14:56.795 --> 14:58.564
THAT MEANS GETTING A CAKE RECIPE
WOULD BE A PIECE OF BROWNIE.

14:58.764 --> 14:59.632
HOLD ME, TIMMY,
I'M FREAKING MYSELF OUT.

15:02.134 --> 15:03.569
- RETINAL SCAN FAILED.

15:03.769 --> 15:05.471
YOU ARE NOT NANA BOOM BOOM.

15:05.671 --> 15:06.939
PREPARE TO BE ANNIHILATED.

15:11.310 --> 15:13.379
- AHHH!

15:13.579 --> 15:15.080
COSMO, YOU NEED TO MAKE ME LOOK
LIKE NANA BOOM BOOM.

15:17.650 --> 15:20.653
- RETINAL SCAN MATCH.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.688
NANA BOOM BOOM IDENTIFIED.

15:22.888 --> 15:26.091
PREPARE FOR
BROWNIE-TO-BRAIN DOWNLOAD.

15:26.292 --> 15:27.293
AHHHH!

15:32.631 --> 15:37.102
AHHHH!

15:37.303 --> 15:39.838
- TIMMY, ARE YOU OKAY?

15:40.039 --> 15:41.940
YEAH, I'M FINE...

15:42.141 --> 15:43.542
2 CUPS OF FAIRY FLOUR,
4 GOLDEN GOOSE EGGS,

15:43.742 --> 15:45.611
A DASH OF TROLL DANDRUFF.

15:45.811 --> 15:48.113
WHOA, THE RECIPE GOT ZAPPED
INTO MY HEAD.

15:48.314 --> 15:49.882
- IT LOOKS AS THOUGH
TIMMY TURNER

15:50.082 --> 15:51.850
HAS WHAT WE CAME FOR,

15:52.051 --> 15:53.819
AND YOU MOCKED ME
FOR BUYING X-RAY GLASSES

15:54.019 --> 15:55.754
FROM THE BACK OF A COMIC BOOK.

15:55.954 --> 15:57.990
- WHY DO WE NEED
THEM BROWNIES ANYWAY?

15:58.190 --> 16:02.394
WE CAN WIN THAT BAKE-OFF
WITH MY ROADKILL CRITTER CAKE.

16:02.594 --> 16:04.697
- NO OFFENSE, DEAR,

16:04.897 --> 16:06.598
BUT NO ONE WANTS A DESSERT
THAT HUNTS MICE IN A SEWER.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.233
WE NEED THAT BROWNIE RECIPE.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.504
- BROWNIE, BROWNIE,
BROWNIE, BROWNIE.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.974
- NO, I DON'T HAVE ANY BROWNIES.

16:16.175 --> 16:21.113
HOW ABOUT A NICE FLAVOR-FREE
TEETHING BISCUIT INSTEAD?

16:21.313 --> 16:24.616
- MORE BROWNIE.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.618
[growling]

16:26.819 --> 16:29.688
BROWNIE.

16:29.888 --> 16:31.123
- WHERE HAVE YOU TWO BEEN?

16:31.323 --> 16:33.125
- BROWNIES.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.060
- WELL,
WE WEREN'T IN THE BAKERY VAULT

16:35.260 --> 16:36.729
STEALING
THE SUPER-SECRET BROWNIE RECIPE,

16:36.929 --> 16:38.330
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE IMPLYING.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.265
- YOU STOLE THE RECIPE?

16:40.466 --> 16:42.368
- MORE.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.670
- IT'S JUST A RECIPE
FOR A STUPID BAKE-OFF.

16:44.870 --> 16:46.004
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.

16:46.205 --> 16:48.240
- YES, IT IS.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.309
TIMMY, THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO,
THERE WAS AN EPIC BATTLE

16:50.509 --> 16:52.511
BETWEEN THE FAIRIES
AND THE ANTI-FAIRIES

16:52.711 --> 16:54.880
TO DETERMINE WHO GOT TO HAVE
FAIRY GODCHILDREN.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.583
AFTER YEARS OF HORRIBLE WAR,

16:57.783 --> 17:01.186
WE DECIDED TO SETTLE THINGS
THE ONLY LOGICAL WAY...

17:01.387 --> 17:03.288
- WITH AN ANNUAL BAKE-OFF.

17:03.489 --> 17:06.791
- NANA BOOM BOOM'S BROWNIES
WIN EVERY YEAR,

17:06.992 --> 17:09.361
BUT IF THE ANTI-FAIRIES
GET THAT RECIPE,

17:09.560 --> 17:11.797
THEY'LL WIN THE BAKE-OFF
AND INHERIT ALL THE GOD KIDS,

17:11.997 --> 17:13.531
INCLUDING YOU, SPORT.

17:13.732 --> 17:15.601
YOU'RE IN TERRIBLE DANGER

17:15.800 --> 17:17.603
UNTIL YOU RETURN THAT RECIPE
TO THE VAULT.

17:17.803 --> 17:19.570
- BROWNIES.

17:19.771 --> 17:21.640
- YEAH,
THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.410
I ACCIDENTALLY DOWNLOADED IT
INTO MY HEAD.

17:24.609 --> 17:26.678
- HI, TONY.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.715
WE'VE COME TO SUCK OUT
THE CONTENTS OF YOUR BRAIN...

17:29.915 --> 17:31.817
I MEAN VACUUM YOUR ROOM.

17:32.017 --> 17:33.385
- WE'RE NOT EVIL IMPOSTERS.

17:38.257 --> 17:40.726
- THAT'S THE LAST TIME
I ORDER MOM-AND-DAD COSTUMES

17:40.926 --> 17:42.694
FROM THE BACK OF A COMIC BOOK.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.963
NOW, HOLD STILL,
WHILE I PAINFULLY SUCK

17:45.164 --> 17:49.334
THE RECIPE...AND YOUR BRAIN..
OUT OF YOUR EAR CANAL.

17:49.535 --> 17:51.336
- DON'T WORRY, TIMMY,
WE'LL SAVE YOU.

17:53.872 --> 17:57.643
TIMMY, SAVE US.

17:59.812 --> 18:04.249
- AHHHHH!

18:04.450 --> 18:07.586
- THANKS, JORGEN.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.521
- DON'T MENTION IT.

18:09.721 --> 18:10.689
NOW, HOLD STILL,
WHILE I REMOVE YOUR HEAD.

18:10.889 --> 18:12.724
- AHHHHH!

18:12.925 --> 18:14.993
- THERE MUST BE
A LESS VIOLENT WAY TO GET

18:15.194 --> 18:17.663
THE FAIRY-CHERRY BROWNIE RECIPE
OUT OF TIMMY'S BRAIN.

18:17.863 --> 18:20.599
- THE FAIRY-CHERRY
BROWNIE RECIPE IS IN HIS BRAIN?

18:20.799 --> 18:24.470
TURNER, IF YOU HAVE THE RECIPE,
WE MUST GET YOU TO A SAFE HOUSE.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.772
- COOL SAFE HOUSE.

18:26.972 --> 18:29.107
- THANKS, I ORDERED IT
FROM THE BACK OF A COMIC BOOK.

18:29.308 --> 18:30.976
IT IS COMPLETELY MAGIC-PROOF.

18:31.176 --> 18:33.879
NO ONE CAN POOF IN OR OUT.

18:34.079 --> 18:35.747
TURNER,
WE MUST KEEP YOU HERE

18:35.948 --> 18:37.316
UNTIL THE FAIRIES
WIN THE BAKE-OFF.

18:37.516 --> 18:39.751
- THIS WHOLE THING IS CRAZY.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.020
WHY WOULD YOU DECIDE THE FATE OF
FAIRY GOD KIDS WITH A BAKE-OFF?

18:42.221 --> 18:44.423
- WELL, WE TRIED TIDDLYWINKS,
BUT IT WAS TOO PAINFUL.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.959
both: MY EYE!

18:47.159 --> 18:50.028
- ANYWAY, THE BAKE-OFF WORKED
OUT GREAT FOR FAIRY WORLD.

18:50.229 --> 18:53.065
NOTHING IS AS DELICIOUS
AS NANA'S BROWNIES.

18:53.265 --> 18:57.002
- WELL, NOTHING EXCEPT
MY BREAD-FREE TOAST.

18:57.202 --> 18:59.471
I LOVE THE BREAD-FREE TASTE.

18:59.671 --> 19:03.442
- ANYWAY, TOODLES,
AND DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.277
- WHY IS EVERYONE LOOKING AT ME?

19:05.477 --> 19:06.645
WHO WANTS MEAT-FREE MEATBALLS?

19:06.845 --> 19:07.913
[door clanging]

19:08.113 --> 19:09.381
- OPEN UP.

19:09.581 --> 19:10.782
- THAT WAS QUICK, JORGEN.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.184
- I AM NOT JORGEN.

19:12.384 --> 19:13.785
- ARRGGH.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.621
- AHHHH!

19:15.821 --> 19:17.289
[all screaming]

19:17.489 --> 19:19.291
- AH-HA-HA-HA-HA!
