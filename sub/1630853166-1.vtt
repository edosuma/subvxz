You just went back to sleep.

woken me up again!

- [Brie] She thinks she's
gonna win the bake sale.

it's your grandma's

05:49.390 --> 05:50.808
super secret recipe?

05:50.892 --> 05:52.727

calling them poop.

- She doesn't know what
she's talking about.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.564
- I know.

05:56.647 --> 05:57.482
Where's your bakes?

05:57.565 --> 05:58.483
- Ms. Melanie had us take some

05:58.566 --> 05:59.984
to the big fridge already.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.402
You might have to go too.

06:01.486 --> 06:02.737
- Great.
- What?

06:02.820 --> 06:05.281
- Vanessa said "I hope
you don't accidentally

06:05.364 --> 06:06.199
drop your bakes."

whiff of Brie's brownies

06:15.041 --> 06:17.126
and they took my breath away.

06:17.210 --> 06:17.960
So good.

to the cafeteria fridge

06:21.506 --> 06:23.007
where the rest of the bakes are?

06:23.091 --> 06:24.383
- Yes, Ms. Melanie.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.803
- Ms. Melanie, I need
to put mine away too.

for the bake sale?

06:33.810 --> 06:34.477
- Sorry.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.728
- [Brie] Wish me luck.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.563
- [Millie] Wishing your
bakes a safe voyage.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.775
- [Ms. Melanie] Oh, why
Jody, those look fantastic.

06:40.858 --> 06:44.153
Why don't you go with
the girls to the fridge?

06:44.237 --> 06:46.280

07:02.296 --> 07:05.633

- All right, everyone.

07:05.716 --> 07:07.218
Settle down.

07:07.301 --> 07:08.678
Take out your
writing assignments

07:08.761 --> 07:10.138
and send them to the front.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.857
- So, who taught
you how to bake?

07:20.940 --> 07:21.691
- My dad's a baker.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.025
- That's so cool.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.360
My dad's lame.

07:24.443 --> 07:25.570
- Why? What's he do?

07:25.653 --> 07:26.696
- He's...

07:26.779 --> 07:27.488
He, uh...

07:27.572 --> 07:28.614
He's a doctor.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.241
- Oh, he must be really busy.

07:30.324 --> 07:31.033
- Very.

07:32.577 --> 07:33.703
- Oh, shoot.

07:33.786 --> 07:34.745
I forgot my whipped
cream in my backpack.

07:34.829 --> 07:35.705
I'll be right back.

07:38.082 --> 07:38.875
- A doctor?

07:38.958 --> 07:41.127
- Don't say anything, or else.

07:44.213 --> 07:46.048
I'm not really gonna
drop your bakes.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.967
I'm gonna beat you
fair and square.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.761
- Yeah, well, we'll just
have to see then, won't we?

08:01.647 --> 08:02.899
- All right, let's go.

08:49.278 --> 08:51.572
Namaste, everyone.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.199
- [Students] Namaste.

08:55.326 --> 08:58.746
- Now, in honor of
today's bake sale,

08:58.829 --> 09:01.540
and because we have
shorter classes,

09:01.624 --> 09:02.792
I thought it would be fun

09:02.875 --> 09:06.796
for each of us to draw
our favorite desserts.

09:06.879 --> 09:07.964
- Nice.

09:08.047 --> 09:11.592
- Now, here's some
paper to draw on.

09:12.677 --> 09:12.885
Pass those back.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.642
Now really think about
the feeling you get

09:19.725 --> 09:24.647
when drawing out the
details of your desserts.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.190
Okay?

09:26.274 --> 09:26.941
Splendid.

09:48.504 --> 09:51.716
(bright playful music)

10:41.974 --> 10:43.434
- I am not a cheese wheel!

10:43.517 --> 10:46.979
- Brie, what on earth
are you talking about?

10:47.063 --> 10:48.689
- [Brie] Nothing.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.149
- What's on that piece of paper?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.361
Brie, show me what's
on that paper.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.325
Who drew this?

11:01.285 --> 11:01.911
Brie?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.455
Millie?

11:04.538 --> 11:05.873
- I don't know.

11:05.956 --> 11:09.001
- Someone tell me who drew this

11:09.085 --> 11:12.171
or none of you will participate
in the bake sale today.

11:12.254 --> 11:12.963
- What?

11:17.051 --> 11:18.135
- One last time.

11:23.432 --> 11:24.350
All right.

11:25.559 --> 11:26.769
I'll tell Ms. Melanie
that each of you

11:26.852 --> 11:28.270
will be waiting in the cafeteria

11:28.354 --> 11:30.064
for your parents to
come and get you.

11:31.023 --> 11:31.982
- It was Vanessa.

11:34.151 --> 11:35.861
- Is this true, Vanessa?

11:35.945 --> 11:37.571
- Kind of.

11:37.655 --> 11:38.989
- You know better than to
gossip about other people,

11:39.073 --> 11:40.866
especially your classmates.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.161
You're going to the
principal's office.

11:44.245 --> 11:46.288
And let this be a lesson
to the rest of you.

11:46.372 --> 11:50.126
There will absolutely no
name calling of any kind.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.961
In this classroom or out of it!

11:55.214 --> 11:56.674
- You're such a tattle tale.

11:56.757 --> 11:57.466
- Vanessa!

12:07.309 --> 12:09.687
(door slams)

12:11.188 --> 12:14.442
The aura in here is
completely tainted.

12:15.443 --> 12:16.652
Continue working
on your drawings

12:16.735 --> 12:17.570
until the bell rings.

12:17.653 --> 12:20.906
(bright playful music)

12:22.074 --> 12:24.994
(school bell rings)

12:26.328 --> 12:27.955
- I can't believe
you just did that.

12:28.038 --> 12:29.415
- Did you hear
how quiet she was?

12:29.498 --> 12:32.168
- I know, but to call her out

12:32.251 --> 12:33.919
in front of everybody?

12:34.003 --> 12:34.879
- [Brie] Mr. Claymore
would've made us

12:34.962 --> 12:36.589
sit out on the bake sale.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.966
- Yeah, but tell him in private

12:39.049 --> 12:43.179
like in a note or after class.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.055
Something else.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.223
- Oh, yeah.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.641
I guess that
would've been better.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.145
- Oh my sweet tart.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.439
There's Vanessa.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.775
Do you think they'll still
let her in the bake sale?

12:56.859 --> 12:57.943
- [Brie] I don't know.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.320
- I hope not.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.155
- [Brie] Only nice people
should be able to do it.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.782
- Well, if she doesn't,

13:03.866 --> 13:04.867
then we're definitely winning

13:04.950 --> 13:06.952
those tickets to Cosmo Land.

13:07.036 --> 13:07.244
- I don't know.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.915
Jody's pies smelled really good.

13:12.041 --> 13:12.875
- Maybe she'll get detention

13:12.958 --> 13:15.044
for like the rest of her life.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.253
- (giggles) Yeah, right.

13:17.379 --> 13:18.589
Wait.

13:18.672 --> 13:21.008
Something's wrong
with your pizza.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.635
- (groans) What the?

13:22.718 --> 13:23.677
- [Brie] Ew.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.429
- It's still frozen.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.680
- Go ask for another one.

13:26.764 --> 13:27.473
- BRB.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.146
- [Student] I can't wait
for the bake sale today!

13:34.230 --> 13:36.899
Vanessa's cupcakes
look really pretty.

13:36.982 --> 13:40.152
(students chattering)

13:40.236 --> 13:42.071
- [Student 2] I wanna
try Jody's pies.

13:42.154 --> 13:45.032
- [Student] Yeah,
we'll see who wins.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.451
- Patricia says she
doesn't know what happened.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.410
- [Brie] Weird.

13:48.494 --> 13:49.828
- So, I just got fruit instead.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.247
- Well that's healthier

13:51.330 --> 13:52.915
since we've been eating
a lot of sweets lately.

13:52.998 --> 13:53.791
- Yeah, yeah.

13:53.874 --> 13:54.959
At least we get out early today.

13:55.042 --> 13:58.003
I love early dismissal days.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.755
- I cannot wait
to win this thing.

13:59.838 --> 14:00.631
- [Millie] Me too.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.512
(playful music)

14:11.141 --> 14:11.225
- (sighs) Here we go.

14:13.102 --> 14:13.185
- We got this.

14:20.526 --> 14:21.944
- Millie, Vanessa's in.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.280
- Sugar, we don't got this.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.368
- All right, kids.

14:29.451 --> 14:30.869
Who's ready for the bake sale?

14:30.953 --> 14:33.455
(students cheering)

14:33.539 --> 14:34.331
- Mm-mm-mm.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.588
Whoever hired him
deserves a medal.

14:42.506 --> 14:45.467
- Whoever made him
deserves a medal.

14:49.638 --> 14:50.306
- Agreed.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.649
- This is your first bake sale?

15:00.733 --> 15:02.109
- Yeah.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.235
We didn't do anything like
this at my other school.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.238
Ms. Melanie, I'm
a little concerned

15:06.322 --> 15:07.573
about the calorie consumption

15:07.656 --> 15:09.074
that's gonna take
place here today.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.743
- Oh, yes. Me too.

15:10.826 --> 15:11.952
It's an awful lot of sugar

15:12.036 --> 15:13.203
for such small children.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.039
- Yeah.

15:15.122 --> 15:15.247
- I think we're ready to start.

15:18.208 --> 15:21.503
(playful music continues)

15:23.172 --> 15:24.715
(Mr. Claymore sighs)

15:24.798 --> 15:27.384
- Trying to get on
his good side, I see?

15:27.468 --> 15:27.551
- No, it's true.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.723
- You were one of the first
to yay the Bake Off, remember?

15:32.806 --> 15:33.682
- Shh!

15:33.766 --> 15:34.975
I'm trying to listen.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.101
- All right, kids.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.853
Who's ready to
start the bake sale?

15:37.936 --> 15:40.314
(all cheering)

15:40.397 --> 15:42.149
That's the spirit I like to see.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.276
All right, a couple
of reminders.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.112
One, try not to eat all
your bakes at once, okay?

15:47.196 --> 15:48.155
We don't want you
guys going home

15:48.238 --> 15:49.823
with severe stomach pains.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.867
And two, this is the big one,

15:51.950 --> 15:53.535
the top four contestants

15:53.619 --> 15:54.536
who sell the most bakes today

15:54.620 --> 15:57.122
will have the
opportunity to compete

15:57.206 --> 15:59.249
in our annual Spring
Bake Off Challenge.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.127
(all applauding)

16:03.295 --> 16:04.296
All right, and now
I'm gonna hand it over

16:04.380 --> 16:06.632
to Ms. Melanie for some
more exciting news.

16:08.676 --> 16:09.635
- Thank you, Lester.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.262
Okay.

16:12.346 --> 16:15.474
The winner of this year's
Spring Bake Off Challenge

16:15.557 --> 16:16.392
will win the usual,

16:16.475 --> 16:20.020
four tickets to Cosmo Land

16:20.104 --> 16:22.481
and, new this year,

16:22.564 --> 16:27.486
is $5,000 towards
your college tuition

16:28.696 --> 16:33.158
thanks to our new
corporate sponsor DCBX.

16:33.242 --> 16:37.162
Now DCBX is going to
be providing our school

16:37.246 --> 16:40.082
with the necessary
tools and technology

16:40.165 --> 16:44.169
to create more extracurricular
activities such as these.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.088
- $5,000?

16:46.171 --> 16:48.048
- Oh my great jellybeans.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.300
- Millie, that's enough to
pay for my culinary school.

16:50.384 --> 16:52.428
- Or a new computer
for The Mighty Realm.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.973
- They said it's
for college tuition,

16:56.056 --> 16:57.391
not computer games.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.977
- Oh, I guess it
can go to that too.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.938
- All right, children.

17:03.021 --> 17:07.276
Ready, set, sell those bakes!

17:07.359 --> 17:10.529
(bright upbeat music)

17:10.612 --> 17:13.741
(students chattering)

17:46.982 --> 17:47.691
- How much?

17:47.775 --> 17:48.942
- How much do you think

17:49.026 --> 17:50.527
these delicious
brownies are worth?

17:50.611 --> 17:51.737
They have a perfect crust

17:51.820 --> 17:54.239
and an ooey-gooey
surprise in the middle.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.199
- Hmm.

17:56.658 --> 17:57.493
Three tickets.

17:57.576 --> 17:58.786
- Great!

17:58.869 --> 18:00.454
But would you like
another brownie

18:00.537 --> 18:01.997
for just two more tickets?

18:04.082 --> 18:05.125
- That's a great deal.

18:05.209 --> 18:05.918
I'll take it.

18:07.461 --> 18:08.212
Thank you!

18:08.295 --> 18:09.546
- Thank you. Tell your friends.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.675
- I thought you said
just one ticket?

18:13.759 --> 18:15.677
- I saw an opportunity
and I took it.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.554
- Dang, you're good.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.015
- Plus my dad taught
me all about upselling.

18:21.058 --> 18:21.767
- Oh.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.019
What's that?

18:27.731 --> 18:29.024
- Here you go.

18:29.107 --> 18:30.275
- Thanks.

18:30.359 --> 18:34.696
Don't forget, #Vanessascupcakes,
#bakesale, #bakes,

18:34.780 --> 18:38.200
#bestcupcakesever, #delicious.

18:38.283 --> 18:38.951
- Got it.

18:39.034 --> 18:40.536
- Tag me @Vanessabakes.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.498
- (sighs) Social media.

18:44.581 --> 18:45.833
- [Millie] That's brilliant.

18:45.916 --> 18:47.125
- Why didn't we think
of that, Millie?

18:47.209 --> 18:48.460
- I didn't know
you could do that.

18:49.628 --> 18:50.712
Where's your phone?

18:50.796 --> 18:51.797
- I left it at home.

18:51.880 --> 18:52.548
Where's yours?

18:52.631 --> 18:53.549
- Mine's still broken.

18:56.009 --> 18:57.219
- Oh, Millie, you
have a customer.

18:57.302 --> 18:58.178
- Oh, why, hello there.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.388
- Hello.

18:59.471 --> 19:00.389
- [Millie] Would
you like a cookie?

19:00.472 --> 19:01.557
- Duh. How much is it?

19:03.392 --> 19:04.726
- How much do you think
this cookie is worth?

19:04.810 --> 19:06.395
It is baked to perfection

19:06.478 --> 19:08.730
and has ooey-gooey chocolate
chips in the middle.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.357
- Um, a ticket?

19:10.440 --> 19:12.276
- Um, how about three tickets?

19:12.359 --> 19:13.318
- That's too much.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.153
I said one ticket.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.363
- Two tickets?

19:16.446 --> 19:18.073
- How about I take
my ticket elsewhere?

19:18.156 --> 19:20.993
- For an extra ticket you
could add chocolate on top.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.079
Okay, okay, okay.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.080
One ticket it is.

19:25.163 --> 19:26.456
- [Jade] Now that's
more like it.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.667
- Thank you very much.

19:28.750 --> 19:29.418
Come again.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.382
Whew, what a tough customer.

19:35.465 --> 19:36.383
- You handled that well.

19:36.466 --> 19:37.467
- Thanks.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.635
- We would like more
brownies, please.

19:38.719 --> 19:39.970
- [Brie] Great seeing you again.

19:40.053 --> 19:42.222
- Can you give us
a group discount?

19:43.891 --> 19:46.685
- Um, I normally
wouldn't do that

19:46.768 --> 19:49.146
but I'll make an exception.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.565
Instead of three tickets
per brownie, how about two?

19:57.029 --> 19:58.697
- Okay, we can do two.

20:02.576 --> 20:05.203
- These are amazing. Thanks.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.538
- Thank you.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.373
- Pleasure doing
business with you.

20:08.457 --> 20:08.498
- Likewise.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.386
(light music)

20:21.470 --> 20:24.389
(children groaning)

20:31.063 --> 20:33.565
- Okay, kids, bake sale is over.

20:33.649 --> 20:34.650
Bakers, please bring
your pencil boxes

20:34.733 --> 20:37.736
over to Ms. Melanie's
station right over here.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.281
- Oh my God, this
pie is so good.

20:41.365 --> 20:42.491
- [Ms. Silvera] Mm-hmm.

20:42.574 --> 20:43.659
- [Ms. Henderson] Who do
you think is gonna win?

20:43.742 --> 20:44.284
- [Ms. Silvera]
Whoever made this pie.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.702
(all chuckle)

20:45.786 --> 20:48.330
- Ms. Henderson!

20:48.413 --> 20:49.915
Ms. Henderson.
- Hi, hi.

20:49.998 --> 20:52.042
- Hi, did you get my text?

20:52.125 --> 20:53.710
- No, I didn't get anything.

20:53.794 --> 20:54.962
- Really? Oh.

20:55.045 --> 20:58.507
I sent it at 11:00
o'clock last night.

20:58.590 --> 21:01.385
- Oh, well I was
probably sleeping.

21:01.468 --> 21:03.845
- Stuart did not understand
the math homework last night.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.389
- [Stuart] Mom!

21:05.472 --> 21:07.808
- Okay, well yes we
went over it today.

21:07.891 --> 21:10.352
- Okay, well just so you know.

21:10.435 --> 21:11.353
Come on, dear.

21:13.522 --> 21:14.523
- You need to
change your number.

21:14.606 --> 21:15.524
- I have, twice.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.406
- Here you go.

21:22.489 --> 21:23.490
- All right, everyone,

21:23.573 --> 21:25.534
we are ready to
announce the winners

21:25.617 --> 21:26.910
of today's bake sale.

21:28.120 --> 21:32.749
In fourth place we have
Jody selling 40 tickets.

21:34.376 --> 21:34.918
(all applauding)

21:35.002 --> 21:36.003
- Fourth?

21:36.086 --> 21:36.795
- Congrats, Jody.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.338
Happy you made the cut.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.882
- My dad is not gonna
be happy about this.

21:40.966 --> 21:44.219
- In third place we
have Millie Thompson

21:44.302 --> 21:45.721
selling 47 tickets.

21:45.804 --> 21:46.513
- Good job, Millie.

21:46.596 --> 21:47.806
- Way to go.

21:47.889 --> 21:49.516
Yes.

21:49.599 --> 21:53.270
In second place
we have Brie Hayes

21:53.353 --> 21:55.105
selling 52 tickets.

21:55.188 --> 21:56.273
- Second place?

21:56.356 --> 21:57.399
- 52 is a lot.

21:57.482 --> 21:58.650
- Good job, Brie.

21:58.734 --> 22:01.069
- And in first place we have-

22:02.362 --> 22:04.364
- Don't say Vanessa,
don't say Vanessa.

22:04.448 --> 22:07.117
- Vanessa Weiler
selling 53 tickets!

22:07.200 --> 22:09.161
- Yes!
- Wow, what a close race.

22:09.244 --> 22:09.953
- We should get a recount.

22:10.037 --> 22:10.912
- What?

22:10.996 --> 22:11.997
- What did you just say?

22:12.080 --> 22:12.789
- Oh, me?

22:12.873 --> 22:13.665
Um, nothing.

22:13.749 --> 22:14.791
- You're gonna regret that.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.418
- All right, today's bake sale

22:16.501 --> 22:20.088
helped raise $936
for the school.

22:20.172 --> 22:20.922
That's great.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.299
You four will compete

22:22.382 --> 22:24.760
in our annual Spring
Bake Off Challenge

22:24.843 --> 22:29.097
for a chance to win four tickets
to Cosmo Land and $5,000.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.725
(all applauding)

22:31.808 --> 22:33.393
All right, guys,
let's clean it up.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.689
- Why did I have to
say that, Millie?

22:37.773 --> 22:39.066
- Good question.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.942
- I just wanted to
win first place.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.235
- I mean, you got second.

22:42.319 --> 22:43.612
That's still pretty good.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.489
- Not when Vanessa wins first.

22:46.573 --> 22:47.449
- The important thing

22:47.532 --> 22:48.450
is that we made final four.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.327
That was our goal.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.204
- That means I'm
only second as good.

22:52.287 --> 22:53.163
- No, that just means Vanessa

22:53.246 --> 22:55.457
had a better marketing strategy.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.375
- My grandma would not be proud.

22:57.459 --> 22:58.710
- That's a terrible
thing to say.

22:58.794 --> 22:59.628
I'm sure she was
the sweetest lady.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.548
- She was actually kinda mean.

23:03.632 --> 23:04.549
- They all are.

23:10.138 --> 23:11.223
- I'm so sorry, girls.

23:11.306 --> 23:12.557
- Dad, it's 4:37!

23:12.641 --> 23:13.809
- I know.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.602
I got distracted
with a phone call.

23:15.685 --> 23:16.561
How'd the bake sale go?

23:16.645 --> 23:18.438
- We got in!
- Yes!

23:18.522 --> 23:20.315
I told you girls.

23:20.398 --> 23:21.441
Why the face, Brie?

23:21.525 --> 23:22.651
- I got second.

23:22.734 --> 23:23.902
- That's great, sweetie.

23:24.986 --> 23:26.571
Millie, did you get first then?

23:26.655 --> 23:27.989
- She got third.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.075
- Vanessa got first.

23:30.158 --> 23:31.451
- Vanessa Weiler?

23:31.535 --> 23:32.369
- Yes, Dad.

23:32.452 --> 23:33.537
What other Vanessa is there?

23:33.620 --> 23:34.663
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:34.746 --> 23:35.914
Drop the tude, Brie.

23:37.165 --> 23:40.085
You should be happy
you're in the Bake Off.

23:40.168 --> 23:40.794
All right?

23:42.003 --> 23:43.004
Come on.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.589
Let's get you guys home.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.466
- [Millie] Did your dad
really just say tude?

23:46.550 --> 23:47.592
- [Brie] Yeah.

23:47.676 --> 23:50.595
(playful music)

23:50.679 --> 23:51.471
- Hurry up, ladies.

23:57.644 --> 24:00.438
(insects chirping)

24:09.239 --> 24:10.657
Brie, wake up.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.325
- You got drool on
your face, toots.

24:12.409 --> 24:14.494
- Millie, don't call her that.

24:14.578 --> 24:15.745
Brie, finish your homework.

24:17.622 --> 24:18.748
- How can you concentrate?

24:18.832 --> 24:20.667
It's so boring.

24:20.750 --> 24:21.710
- I don't know.

24:21.793 --> 24:23.587
I guess I just really
like the story.

24:23.670 --> 24:27.090
- [Jamie] Sweetie, you
have got to cheer up.

24:27.174 --> 24:28.258
- That's easy for you to say.

24:28.341 --> 24:29.843
You're a grown-up.

24:29.926 --> 24:31.303
- Well if you focus
on your homework,

24:31.386 --> 24:33.430
maybe you'll forget
about what happened.

24:33.513 --> 24:35.265
- Oh, can we make
chocolate cake?

24:35.348 --> 24:37.392
- I said focus on homework.

24:37.475 --> 24:39.102
- Actually, can we, Dad?

24:39.186 --> 24:40.395
- You wanna bake more?

24:40.478 --> 24:42.397
- Yeah, like you
say in your book,

24:42.480 --> 24:44.357
I need to vent out my feelings.

24:44.441 --> 24:45.734
- Nice.

24:45.817 --> 24:48.361
- Okay, if it'll
make you feel better.

24:48.445 --> 24:50.363
Just make sure you
finish your homework.

24:50.447 --> 24:51.740
- Thanks, Dad,
- Thanks, Mr. H.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.867
- [Jamie] Call me if
you need anything.

24:56.953 --> 24:57.746
- I'll mix the dry ingredients,

24:57.829 --> 24:58.496
you mix the wet.

24:58.580 --> 24:59.998
- [Millie] On it.

25:00.081 --> 25:02.959
(silverware clattering)

25:03.043 --> 25:05.587
- [Brie] Mm, cocoa
powder smells so good.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.756
- [Millie] Here's the wet
ingredients for your mix.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.341
- [Brie] I'll butter the pan.

25:10.258 --> 25:11.301
(Peter screams)

25:11.384 --> 25:12.969
- Holy pretzel sticks, Peter!

25:13.053 --> 25:14.554
You made us drop the mix!

25:14.638 --> 25:16.223
- It's all over the floor!

25:16.306 --> 25:17.015
- Dad!

25:21.144 --> 25:21.853
- Are you okay?

25:21.937 --> 25:22.604
What's going on?

25:22.687 --> 25:23.605
What did you guys do?

25:23.688 --> 25:24.814
- Us?

25:24.898 --> 25:26.107
Peter scared us and
made us drop the mix.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.734
- Our cake is ruined.

25:27.817 --> 25:30.111
- Peter Ivan Hayes,
get down here!

25:30.195 --> 25:30.862
- So much for baking a cake.

25:33.031 --> 25:36.618
- Peter, help your
sister clean this up.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.536
Why did you do that?

25:38.620 --> 25:39.871
- I thought it would be funny.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.623
- Well, not today.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.208
You get 30 minutes of time out.

25:43.291 --> 25:44.042
- 30?
- Mm-hmm.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.211
- It should be an hour.

25:46.294 --> 25:47.712
- Or three.

25:47.796 --> 25:47.879
Hundred.

25:49.965 --> 25:51.633
(chuckles) I'm watching you.

25:51.716 --> 25:53.301
- After you girls clean this up

25:53.385 --> 25:54.552
you can bake another one

25:54.636 --> 25:57.555
while your brother is
upstairs, all right?

25:57.639 --> 26:00.183
- I don't know why we're helping
to clean this up, but okay.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.021
Here's my phone.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.356
- [Millie] Do you think if
you had your phone today

26:06.439 --> 26:07.816
you would've won the bake sale?

26:07.899 --> 26:09.651
- Millie, I don't wanna
think about that right meow.

26:09.734 --> 26:10.443
- Sorry.

26:12.737 --> 26:15.949
(light cheerful music)

26:17.867 --> 26:19.035
(train horn whistling)

26:19.119 --> 26:20.704
- Oh my goodness, this question
doesn't make any sense.

26:20.787 --> 26:21.705
(phone chiming)

26:21.788 --> 26:22.831
- [Millie] Yes!

26:22.914 --> 26:23.748
- [Peter] I wanna
go check the cake!

26:23.832 --> 26:25.083
- No, Peter! You stay.

26:25.166 --> 26:26.501
- [Millie] We don't
want you messing up

26:26.584 --> 26:28.295
our chocolate masterpiece.

26:28.378 --> 26:29.754
- Stay, Peter.

26:29.838 --> 26:29.921
Stay.

26:31.798 --> 26:33.550
Stay.

26:33.633 --> 26:34.342
Ah-ah! Sit!

26:36.803 --> 26:37.679
Good boy.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.806
(spring boinging on TV)

26:39.889 --> 26:41.266
(character laughing on TV)

26:41.349 --> 26:42.017
Hey, Dad.

26:42.100 --> 26:42.183
The cakes are ready.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.270
Mm-hmm. Okay.

26:46.187 --> 26:46.896
Bye.

26:56.156 --> 26:56.906
- All ready.

26:58.783 --> 26:59.659
- [Millie] Oh my goodness,
they look so good.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.077
- That looks good, girls.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.746
- It rose perfectly.

27:02.829 --> 27:03.538
- Hello!

27:03.621 --> 27:05.457
Jamie, kids!

27:05.540 --> 27:07.542
Can someone help me with
the groceries, please?

27:07.625 --> 27:08.960
- I'll be right there.

27:11.504 --> 27:12.380
Oh! (laughs)

27:12.464 --> 27:13.673
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, honey.

27:13.757 --> 27:14.466
- [Peter] Mommy!

27:14.549 --> 27:16.843
- Hello, Peter!

27:16.926 --> 27:17.927
(lips smacking)

27:18.011 --> 27:19.137
- Let me help you with this.

27:19.220 --> 27:19.929
- Thank you.

27:21.389 --> 27:23.016
Oh, I see you baked again.

27:23.099 --> 27:25.560
- Yeah, but Peter scared
us and made us drop it.

27:25.643 --> 27:27.729
So we made it again.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.689
- Now, Peter, if you're
gonna scare someone,

27:29.773 --> 27:32.650
at least make sure they're not
holding something important.

27:33.818 --> 27:34.778
- Got it.
- Okay, good.

27:34.861 --> 27:36.154
- Marcy.

27:36.237 --> 27:36.321
- What?

27:38.198 --> 27:42.243
I mean, Peter, don't
you ever do anything

27:42.327 --> 27:43.912
like that again, okay?

27:43.995 --> 27:45.622
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:45.705 --> 27:47.582
Now go get the groceries.

27:47.665 --> 27:48.375
- Come on, buddy.

27:49.959 --> 27:53.755
- So, I'm assuming you sold
all your brownies today?

27:53.838 --> 27:54.756
- [Brie] No.

27:54.839 --> 27:55.673
- No?

27:55.757 --> 27:56.966
What do you mean no?

27:57.050 --> 27:59.052
- I got second place.

27:59.135 --> 27:59.177
- Second?

28:00.929 --> 28:02.013
Oh.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.765
Well, at least
you got in, right?

28:03.848 --> 28:05.558
- [Brie] Yeah, but
Vanessa got first.

28:06.601 --> 28:07.811
- Oh.

28:07.894 --> 28:09.354
Vanessa Weiler?

28:09.437 --> 28:10.438
- [Brie] Yeah.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.357
- [Marcy] Well
what did she make?

28:12.440 --> 28:13.608
- Cupcakes.

28:13.691 --> 28:16.027
- She used social media tactics

28:16.111 --> 28:17.445
to market her cupcakes.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.322
- Oh, wow.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.449
Well why didn't you do that?

28:21.533 --> 28:22.450
- I left my phone at home.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.536
- And mine's still broken.

28:24.619 --> 28:25.453
- [Marcy] Well did
she say anything

28:25.537 --> 28:26.913
to you afterward?

28:26.996 --> 28:27.038
- [Brie] Uh, no.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.291
- [Millie] Oh, you got donuts.

28:30.375 --> 28:31.751
- Yes, they were on sale.

28:31.835 --> 28:32.919
- [Millie] Where do these go?

28:33.002 --> 28:34.504
- In that cabinet right there.

28:35.922 --> 28:37.966
So what place did
you get, Millie?

28:38.049 --> 28:38.716
- [Millie] Third.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.260
Oh, the winners get more

28:40.343 --> 28:42.470
than just Cosmo Land tickets
if they win this year.

28:42.554 --> 28:43.888
- Oh yeah, what's that?

28:43.972 --> 28:46.057
- $5,000.

28:48.393 --> 28:51.438
- $5,000?

28:51.521 --> 28:52.397
Jamie, did you hear that?

28:52.480 --> 28:53.481
- Yeah, I heard.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.817
Brie, how come you
didn't tell me sooner?

28:55.900 --> 28:57.277
- [Millie] She was
too bust moping.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.027
- I was not!

28:59.654 --> 29:01.739
- Uh-hmm. Was too.

29:01.823 --> 29:04.117
- Well you two will have a fun
opportunity to bake together.

29:07.954 --> 29:08.163
Who ate a donut?

29:11.624 --> 29:12.876
Peter!

29:12.959 --> 29:13.918
How many times do
I have to tell you

29:14.002 --> 29:15.545
not before dinner?

29:16.796 --> 29:18.006
That boy never listens.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.674
- Tell me about it.

29:21.050 --> 29:23.553
(goofy music)

29:26.097 --> 29:29.726
(character laughing on TV)

29:35.190 --> 29:40.111
(car engine humming)
(dog barking)

29:55.335 --> 29:57.712
- Dad?

30:17.398 --> 30:18.399
Dad?

30:18.483 --> 30:19.901
- [Eugene] Hmm?

30:19.984 --> 30:22.904
- I have some great news.

30:27.450 --> 30:29.369
I got first place

30:29.452 --> 30:30.537
in the bake sale today.

30:32.121 --> 30:33.831
I helped to raise
a bunch of money

30:35.875 --> 30:37.752
and I get to compete

30:37.835 --> 30:40.296
in the Spring Bake Off
Challenge for $5,000.

30:43.841 --> 30:45.218
- [Eugene] That's
great, sweetie.

30:45.301 --> 30:45.343
- Yeah.

30:47.470 --> 30:48.888
The Bake Off is in like a month.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.682
So I have to practice some more.

30:53.643 --> 30:55.144
- [Eugene] Who took
you home today?

30:55.228 --> 30:56.854
- Maxine's mom.

30:56.938 --> 30:59.649
(microwave beeps)

31:01.317 --> 31:02.110
- Oh, good.

31:25.049 --> 31:27.343
Did you finish your homework?

31:29.470 --> 31:29.554
- Yeah.

31:31.806 --> 31:32.974
- [Man On TV] Perfect.

31:33.057 --> 31:33.266
Are you serious?

31:41.065 --> 31:42.400
There was nothing else, huh?

31:42.483 --> 31:44.193
- Go!
- Stay close.

31:49.407 --> 31:53.161
- That chocolate
cake tastes so good.

31:53.244 --> 31:54.037
- [Jamie] Mm-hmm.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.246
- I'm surprised you had room

31:55.330 --> 31:57.373
after having
seconds and a donut.

31:57.457 --> 32:00.335
- [Peter] I couldn't
help myself.

32:00.418 --> 32:02.086
- [Brie] Shh, guys!
I'm trying to listen.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.839
- [Host On TV] Eight years old
from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

32:04.922 --> 32:06.341
with an IQ of 250

32:06.424 --> 32:09.510
which is way higher
than most Americans.

32:09.594 --> 32:11.471
- I can't believe how
much these kids are.

32:11.554 --> 32:12.263
- Me neither.

32:12.347 --> 32:13.139
(doorbell rings)

32:13.222 --> 32:14.557
- Millie, that is your mom.

32:14.641 --> 32:16.017
Why don't you get your stuff?

32:16.100 --> 32:17.143
- You don't have
to get up, honey.

32:17.226 --> 32:18.436
I'll get it.

32:18.519 --> 32:19.729
- Oh.

32:19.812 --> 32:21.022
Thank you, sweetheart.

32:21.105 --> 32:22.273
- You're welcome.

32:22.357 --> 32:23.191
- [Millie] Peace out.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.108
Thanks for dinner, Mrs. H.

32:24.192 --> 32:25.026
- You're welcome.

32:25.109 --> 32:26.277
Have a nice night, Millie.

32:26.361 --> 32:27.737
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.201
- Hey!
- Hi, Barb.

32:33.284 --> 32:34.577
- Thanks for keeping
Millie so late.

32:34.661 --> 32:35.828
- Of course.

32:35.912 --> 32:36.579
- I got caught up
at the hospital.

32:36.663 --> 32:37.747
- It's not a problem.

32:37.830 --> 32:39.540
They finished all their homework

32:39.624 --> 32:41.042
and they baked
another cake today.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.085
- Another cake?
- Mm-hmm.

32:42.168 --> 32:43.336
- Okay. Thank you.

32:43.419 --> 32:44.337
(Jamie laughs)

32:44.420 --> 32:45.296
- What's up, Mamma?

32:45.380 --> 32:47.590
- Congratulations, little star.

32:47.674 --> 32:48.383
- Thanks, Mamma.
- I'm so proud of you

32:48.466 --> 32:50.093
for getting in.

32:50.176 --> 32:51.969
- Hey, did you hear
about the sponsorship?

32:52.053 --> 32:53.888
- Yeah, Marcy told
me on the phone.

32:53.971 --> 32:56.099
- Yeah, $5,000.
- I know.

32:56.182 --> 32:57.975
- Well, that is exciting.

32:58.059 --> 32:59.018
Well, we'll let you go.

32:59.102 --> 33:00.228
- Of course.

33:00.311 --> 33:01.020
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome.

33:01.104 --> 33:02.063
- Thanks, Mr. H.
- All right.

33:02.146 --> 33:03.314
Have a good night.
- Take care.

33:08.444 --> 33:11.072
- [Host On TV] And
remember, kids,

33:11.155 --> 33:15.118
be smart and keep on studying.

33:15.201 --> 33:17.453
This is your hostess
with the mostest.

33:17.537 --> 33:20.415
My name is Leonard Moe.
- All right, you two.

33:20.498 --> 33:21.374
It's time for bed.
- And I will see you

33:21.457 --> 33:22.667
next time.
- Okay.

33:22.750 --> 33:24.252
- All right, go
brush your teeth.

33:25.169 --> 33:26.671
I'll be up in a minute.

33:26.754 --> 33:27.463
- Okay.

33:39.559 --> 33:42.061
(Jamie sighs)

33:43.312 --> 33:44.480
- I'll do the dishes, honey.

33:45.815 --> 33:47.775
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.277
- You're being
unusually sweet today.

33:51.279 --> 33:52.113
What's wrong?

34:00.037 --> 34:02.039
- I haven't got my
advance yet from Grant.

34:02.123 --> 34:03.082
- What?

34:03.166 --> 34:03.875
- I know.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.378
I've been on the phone
with him all day.

34:10.131 --> 34:12.216
He said it's gonna be
another couple of months.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.135
- Another couple months?

34:14.218 --> 34:16.053
Doesn't he know we have
a family to support?

34:16.137 --> 34:17.138
- I told him.

34:17.221 --> 34:19.640
- We're barley making
ends meet on my salary.

34:19.724 --> 34:20.391
- I know.

34:22.059 --> 34:23.227
I feel terrible.

34:24.395 --> 34:25.480
Maybe I should just go
back to a full time.

34:27.732 --> 34:28.733
It's more secure.

34:30.276 --> 34:31.152
- No.

34:32.361 --> 34:33.446
Don't do that.

34:35.490 --> 34:36.783
We'll dip into our savings

34:36.866 --> 34:39.494
and just put it back
when you get it.

34:44.332 --> 34:45.374
- I'm sorry, honey.

34:48.211 --> 34:50.296
I waited to tell you
without the kids.

34:50.379 --> 34:52.840
- No, I'm glad you waited.

34:56.010 --> 34:57.053
- I just feel bad.

34:58.304 --> 35:00.723
You're the only one
bringing home the bacon.

35:03.518 --> 35:05.103
Like both food and money.

35:09.148 --> 35:10.399
- Honey, it's fine.

35:12.860 --> 35:14.570
We've been in worse places.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.324
I do wanna give Grant

35:18.407 --> 35:19.200
a piece of my mind though.

35:19.283 --> 35:21.285
- I know. It's so frustrating.

35:27.667 --> 35:30.795
- [Marcy] She leaves
this thing everywhere.

35:33.381 --> 35:35.299
- I just hope my
book sells well.

35:38.845 --> 35:39.554
- It will.

35:39.637 --> 35:42.265
(gentle music)

35:46.352 --> 35:48.896
It'll be all right, honey.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.482
- Thank you, baby.

36:06.956 --> 36:09.542
(pleasant music)

36:12.211 --> 36:15.131
(school bell rings)

36:31.439 --> 36:34.650
(bright playful music)

36:38.738 --> 36:41.657
- [Brie] Vanessa hasn't
said anything to me today.

36:41.741 --> 36:43.201
- [Millie] What?

36:43.284 --> 36:45.828
Oh, I almost forgot she
heard you wanting a recount.

36:55.212 --> 36:56.547
- [Brie] I think she forgot.

36:56.631 --> 36:58.591
I mean, she got first place.

37:01.677 --> 37:03.638
- [Millie] Yeah,
maybe she'll forget

37:03.721 --> 37:04.472
all about it just like I did.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.940
(Ms. Henderson clears throat)

37:28.204 --> 37:29.997
- [Brie] Exactly. We good.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.585
(whistle blares)
(Vanessa screams)

37:34.669 --> 37:36.545
(upbeat determined music)

37:36.629 --> 37:37.338
- Dip and dodge.

37:37.421 --> 37:38.297
Here we go, come on.

37:38.381 --> 37:38.714
Bop and weave.

37:41.884 --> 37:42.718
All right, here we go, guys.

37:42.802 --> 37:43.636
Dip and dodge. Dip and dodge.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.556
- This doesn't look
very good, Brie.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.016
- I know, just keep dodging.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.434
- Burn some calories.

37:50.518 --> 37:51.394
Yep.

37:53.771 --> 37:54.814
You call that a throw?

37:55.982 --> 37:56.857
Use your tricep.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.317
Get your shoulders into it.

37:58.401 --> 37:59.110
Come on.

38:37.481 --> 38:41.986
- Mr. Lester said no head shots.

38:42.069 --> 38:42.778
- Oops.

38:45.281 --> 38:46.991
- [Millie] Mr. Lester!

38:56.542 --> 38:59.378
- You can do it,
Brie. Grab a ball.

39:11.807 --> 39:12.975
- Brie, what are you...

39:13.059 --> 39:14.435
Don't hide behind
other kids, no.

39:14.518 --> 39:15.811
Use your instincts, come on.

39:23.402 --> 39:28.324
(bone crunching)
(Brie screams)

39:30.868 --> 39:33.579
- I'm sorry, Mr. Winters,
but you signed the contract.

39:35.039 --> 39:38.459
The Montgomery Ballroom was
never available on the 26th.

39:38.542 --> 39:39.418
Yes.

39:41.045 --> 39:41.962
As I told you before,

39:42.046 --> 39:43.923
another event has booked it.

39:44.006 --> 39:46.467
The other option is
the Hartford Ballroom.

39:46.550 --> 39:47.718
It's similar in size

39:47.802 --> 39:49.386
but at the opposite
end of the hotel.

39:51.555 --> 39:53.390
I understand that, sir, but...

39:55.393 --> 39:56.102
No.

40:00.815 --> 40:00.898
Yes.

40:03.818 --> 40:05.277
All right.

40:05.361 --> 40:06.112
Have a good day.

40:08.906 --> 40:12.076
(Marcy sighs)

40:12.159 --> 40:14.286
Brie, you heard what
the doctor said.

40:14.370 --> 40:16.163
It's just a small fracture.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.915
- Mom, the Bake
Off is next month.

40:17.998 --> 40:18.999
How am I supposed to practice?

40:19.083 --> 40:21.961
- Brie, you are a
wonderful baker.

40:22.044 --> 40:23.587
You have great instincts.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.589
- [Brie] Instinct
is what got me here.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.049
- What are you talking about?

40:27.133 --> 40:29.802
- Mr. Lester told me to use
my instincts in gym class

40:29.885 --> 40:31.387
and what do I do?

40:31.470 --> 40:33.389
I hide behind Jeremy
thinking I would be safe.

40:33.472 --> 40:34.473
And what happened?

40:34.557 --> 40:35.850
I get squashed.

40:35.933 --> 40:38.644
I should've just taken a
dodge ball to the face.

40:38.727 --> 40:40.062
- To the face?

40:40.146 --> 40:42.606
Why would you take a
dodge ball to the face?

40:42.690 --> 40:44.817
- Um, that was
just an expression.

40:44.900 --> 40:46.861
- What did you mean by that?

40:46.944 --> 40:47.027
- I...

40:48.988 --> 40:49.613
Well...

40:49.697 --> 40:51.240
- Brie Alexandra Hayes,

40:51.323 --> 40:54.493
why would you take a
dodge ball to the face?

40:54.577 --> 40:55.828
- Vanessa was kind of attacking

40:55.911 --> 40:57.955
me and Millie with her friends.

40:58.038 --> 40:58.789
- What?

40:58.873 --> 41:00.749
Brie, why didn't you tell me?

41:02.334 --> 41:04.253
I can't believe this
is happening again.

41:05.254 --> 41:06.380
I should call the principle.

41:06.463 --> 41:07.673
- No.

41:07.756 --> 41:09.258
I'm sure she didn't
mean to hit Jeremy

41:09.341 --> 41:11.218
and have him fall on me
and then break my arm.

41:11.302 --> 41:12.511
It just happened.

41:12.595 --> 41:14.138
- Brie, it is not okay

41:14.221 --> 41:15.639
that she keeps targeting you.

41:15.723 --> 41:16.432
It's also not okay

41:16.515 --> 41:18.100
for you to stick up for her.

41:18.184 --> 41:21.729
Now I know you used to be
best friends in Kindergarten

41:21.812 --> 41:24.982
before, well, you know.

41:25.065 --> 41:27.651
But this is just ridiculous.

41:27.735 --> 41:28.736
I should call her father.

41:28.819 --> 41:30.863
- Mom, please stop!
I'm handling it.

41:30.946 --> 41:33.574
- Not if you come home with
a broken arm, you aren't.

41:33.657 --> 41:34.825
I can't believe
you never told me

41:34.909 --> 41:36.076
that Vanessa was there.

41:37.411 --> 41:38.704
Oh.

41:38.787 --> 41:41.373
Is that why Millie had a
bruise on her forehead?

41:41.457 --> 41:42.333
- Yep.

41:42.416 --> 41:43.876
Dodge ball right to the face.

41:43.959 --> 41:45.586
It was not pretty.

41:45.669 --> 41:47.296
But that's why I didn't tell you

41:47.379 --> 41:48.672
because I knew you would
make a big deal out of it.

41:48.756 --> 41:51.175
- Because it is a big deal.

41:51.258 --> 41:54.637
Now, Brie, as your mother,
you are my responsibility

41:54.720 --> 41:55.846
and right now you're
not safe in school.

41:55.930 --> 41:58.599
- I've just gotta win
the Bake Off, Mom.

41:58.682 --> 41:59.642
Then I can prove to her

41:59.725 --> 42:01.352
that she's not better than me.

42:01.435 --> 42:03.646
Please don't call her
dad or the principal

42:03.729 --> 42:04.813
or anyone else.

42:04.897 --> 42:06.106
It's embarrassing

42:06.190 --> 42:07.733
and it's just gonna
make things worse.

42:10.819 --> 42:13.489
- You really don't
want me to do anything?

42:13.572 --> 42:15.616
- Just help me win
the Bake Off, please.

42:18.744 --> 42:20.287
- All right.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.206
If that's what you want.

42:22.289 --> 42:25.834
But, Brie, if Vanessa
threatens you,

42:25.918 --> 42:27.127
if she makes fun of you

42:27.211 --> 42:29.672
or so far as puts
a finger on you,

42:29.755 --> 42:30.965
you better tell me.

42:31.048 --> 42:31.757
You got that?

42:31.840 --> 42:32.925
- Yes, Mom.

42:33.008 --> 42:34.551
- [Marcy] Okay, good.

42:34.635 --> 42:35.803
- Thanks, Mom.

42:35.886 --> 42:37.513
- You're welcome.

42:37.596 --> 42:40.599
I am gonna push you really
hard to win this thing.

42:40.683 --> 42:41.684
- Good.

42:41.767 --> 42:43.602
- This weekend,

42:43.686 --> 42:45.729
it's on.

42:45.813 --> 42:46.563
- Can't wait.

42:46.647 --> 42:49.441
(cheerful music)

42:53.404 --> 42:56.573
- Ready, and mix!

42:57.783 --> 42:58.867
Come on, guys!

42:58.951 --> 42:59.034
Faster!

43:00.744 --> 43:01.787
You call that mixing?

43:01.870 --> 43:03.163
Let's see those spoons move!

43:04.331 --> 43:05.666
30 seconds left.

43:08.210 --> 43:08.836
Ready,

43:10.963 --> 43:11.046
set,

43:13.882 --> 43:14.675
go.

43:14.758 --> 43:17.386
(bright music)

43:25.644 --> 43:26.395
- Yes!

43:26.478 --> 43:27.187
- 16 seconds.

43:33.110 --> 43:34.445
49 seconds.

43:34.528 --> 43:35.696
- Fudge popsicle sticks!

43:35.779 --> 43:36.947
(bell dings)

43:37.031 --> 43:38.615
- Come on, ladies.
Push yourselves.

43:38.699 --> 43:39.408
Hustle, hustle.

43:39.491 --> 43:40.492
You can do it, let's go!

43:40.576 --> 43:42.661
- Why are we doing abs, Mrs. H?

43:42.745 --> 43:44.371
- Don't question me, young lady.

43:44.455 --> 43:45.289
- Yes, ma'am.

43:45.372 --> 43:47.207
Brie, why are we doing abs?

43:47.291 --> 43:48.584
- I don't know.
(timer beeps)

43:48.667 --> 43:50.002
- All right, ladies.

43:50.085 --> 43:51.420
That's enough for today.

43:51.503 --> 43:53.005
Tomorrow we practice
taking cakes

43:53.088 --> 43:54.465
out of the oven without a timer.

43:54.548 --> 43:55.799
- We're doing more tomorrow?

43:55.883 --> 43:56.759
- I'm exhausted.

43:56.842 --> 43:57.968
- Yes.

43:58.052 --> 43:59.803
You know I have
to work all week.

43:59.887 --> 44:01.638
Ladies, we are three weeks away.

44:01.722 --> 44:03.223
It's time to hustle.

44:03.307 --> 44:05.893
- I'm gonna hustle my way to
the living room so I can relax.

44:05.976 --> 44:06.810
Come on, Millie.

44:06.894 --> 44:09.271
(playful music)

44:09.355 --> 44:10.522
- You're welcome.

44:10.606 --> 44:11.065
- Thanks, Mom.
- Thanks, Mrs. H.

44:15.819 --> 44:17.863
Your mom's hardcore.

44:17.946 --> 44:19.365
- Yeah, she's crazy.

44:19.448 --> 44:21.241
- [Millie] You did
really good today.

44:21.325 --> 44:22.159
- Not really.

44:22.242 --> 44:24.578
I'm still slow at everything.

44:24.661 --> 44:25.496
- You just need to strengthen

44:25.579 --> 44:26.997
your good arm a little more.

44:27.081 --> 44:28.540
That's all.

44:28.624 --> 44:30.751
- [Brie] I don't think I should
be in the Bake Off anymore.

44:30.834 --> 44:32.378
- Don't say that, Brie.

44:32.461 --> 44:34.338
- Millie, my arm is broken,

44:34.421 --> 44:36.840
I'm super slow, and you're
doing better than me.

44:36.924 --> 44:38.050
You should just win it

44:38.133 --> 44:39.593
and take me to
Cosmo Land with you.

44:39.676 --> 44:41.595
- Doesn't your
cast come off soon?

44:41.678 --> 44:42.388
- Yeah.

44:47.476 --> 44:49.937
- Maybe I should go.

44:50.020 --> 44:51.105
- I'm sorry.

44:51.188 --> 44:53.273
I'm just not in a
chipper mood right now.

44:53.357 --> 44:54.942
- Okay.

44:55.025 --> 44:55.943
Can I borrow your phone?

44:56.026 --> 44:57.361
I'll call my mom.

44:57.444 --> 44:58.153
- [Brie] Yeah.

45:04.243 --> 45:06.286
(phone ringing)

45:06.370 --> 45:08.163
- Hi, Mom. Can you
pick me up meow?

45:08.247 --> 45:09.957
We're done practicing.

45:10.040 --> 45:11.583
Yeah, we're done practicing.

45:12.709 --> 45:13.419
Okay.

45:14.586 --> 45:15.838
Okay.

45:15.921 --> 45:16.880
Okay, Mom.

45:16.964 --> 45:18.132
Love you. Bye.

45:18.215 --> 45:19.675
Bye.

45:19.758 --> 45:20.926
Bye.

45:21.009 --> 45:21.844
Okay, bye.

45:22.761 --> 45:23.137
She'll be here in 15.

45:33.105 --> 45:35.107
So, what did you end up
painting for art class?

45:37.025 --> 45:37.943
- What are you talking about?

45:38.026 --> 45:40.737
- We have final
paintings due on Monday.

45:40.821 --> 45:41.780
- What?

45:41.864 --> 45:42.698
- Yeah.

45:42.781 --> 45:44.199
Remember he said it when...

45:44.283 --> 45:45.492
You know what?

45:45.576 --> 45:46.702
You had your doctor's
appointment that day.

45:46.785 --> 45:47.911
- Millie, why didn't
you remind me?

45:47.995 --> 45:49.496
- I thought I told you.

45:49.580 --> 45:51.623
Remember on Friday Mr.
Claymore was all like,

45:51.707 --> 45:53.834
"Don't forget finals
are due on Monday."

45:53.917 --> 45:54.751
You were there.

45:54.835 --> 45:56.503
- I don't remember that.

45:56.587 --> 45:57.421
- You know what?

45:57.504 --> 45:58.422
You went to the bathroom.

45:58.505 --> 46:00.090
Completely missed it.

46:00.174 --> 46:01.675
What are the chances of that?

46:01.759 --> 46:02.843
- How am I supposed
to make a painting

46:02.926 --> 46:04.094
with a broken arm?

46:04.178 --> 46:05.637
- You've been doing okay
with your other arm.

46:05.721 --> 46:08.432
- How am I supposed to
make a painting in one day?

46:08.515 --> 46:09.183
- I got it.

46:09.266 --> 46:10.350
Just make it abstract.

46:10.434 --> 46:11.935
You'll totally get an A.

46:12.019 --> 46:13.312
Once I went to an art museum

46:13.395 --> 46:15.939
and saw a painting
of a line in a square

46:16.023 --> 46:17.524
worth millions.

46:17.608 --> 46:19.026
I still don't get it.

46:19.109 --> 46:20.152
- I was with you that day.

46:20.235 --> 46:22.070
- Oh, yeah. Wasn't it fun?

46:22.154 --> 46:23.322
- Who are you?

46:23.405 --> 46:25.032
(playful music)

46:25.115 --> 46:28.285
(students chattering)
(school bell rings)

46:28.368 --> 46:29.077
- [Student] I was
trying to draw bushes

46:29.161 --> 46:29.995
and then I gave up.

46:30.078 --> 46:31.413
So I drew some random stripes.

46:31.497 --> 46:33.415
- [Student 2] It looks
like Teletubbies.

46:33.499 --> 46:36.001
- [Student] I think this is
supposed to be grape juice.

46:36.084 --> 46:39.171
Lemons, orange juice,
and strawberries.

46:41.048 --> 46:41.757
- Wow.

46:43.008 --> 46:45.677
I see some very great
pieces of artwork

46:45.761 --> 46:47.679
in front of me today.

46:47.763 --> 46:49.515
Vanessa, why don't you go first?

46:49.598 --> 46:51.892
- I don't have mine
today, Mr. Claymore.

46:51.975 --> 46:52.935
- What happened?

46:53.018 --> 46:55.020
- I, uh, left it at home.

46:58.023 --> 46:59.274
- Okay.

46:59.358 --> 47:02.903
Well, that'll be minus
five points for tardiness.

47:02.986 --> 47:04.196
Brie, how about you next?

47:06.865 --> 47:08.742
Come on, don't be shy.

47:12.204 --> 47:16.291
- Um, so I did something
a little different.

47:19.670 --> 47:22.339
When I thought about my happy
place I thought of the park.

47:22.422 --> 47:23.131
So...

47:25.092 --> 47:26.301
(Mr. Claymore gasps)

47:26.385 --> 47:27.553
- Oh my.

47:28.595 --> 47:29.471
Brie!

47:29.555 --> 47:30.430
- I'm sorry.
- No!

47:32.057 --> 47:35.477
You really went out of your
way to express yourself here.

47:35.561 --> 47:37.813
- Yeah, I did.

47:37.896 --> 47:39.314
- [Mr. Claymore]
Which arm did you use?

47:39.398 --> 47:41.900
- Well, I started out
with my broken arm

47:41.984 --> 47:43.735
but that didn't go so well.

47:43.819 --> 47:45.654
So mainly my left arm.

47:45.737 --> 47:47.489
- Very good.

47:48.407 --> 47:51.326
I can really sense the struggle

47:51.410 --> 47:54.746
within yourself
in this painting.

47:54.830 --> 47:55.956
Excellent work.

47:56.039 --> 47:58.041
A round of applause for Brie.

47:58.125 --> 48:01.253
(students applauding)

48:02.462 --> 48:05.966
(exhales deeply)
Campbell, you're next.

48:06.049 --> 48:08.010
Okay, has everyone had
a chance to present?

48:08.093 --> 48:09.678
(school bell rings)

48:09.761 --> 48:11.096
There's the bell.

48:11.179 --> 48:13.849
Okay, excellent work
today, everyone.

48:13.932 --> 48:16.685
Vanessa, can I see
you for a moment?

48:18.103 --> 48:18.812
- I got it.

48:18.895 --> 48:20.897
- You sure?

48:20.981 --> 48:21.690
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

48:23.108 --> 48:25.277
I'll see you in the cafeteria.

48:25.360 --> 48:25.402
- Okay.

48:37.331 --> 48:38.248
- [Brie] Hey.

48:38.332 --> 48:39.207
- What do you want?

48:41.043 --> 48:43.003
- My mom almost
called your dad today.

48:43.086 --> 48:44.004
- Figures.

48:44.087 --> 48:46.173
He wouldn't have
answered anyway.

48:46.256 --> 48:47.716
- [Brie] Well, I
just wanted to say-

48:47.799 --> 48:48.508
- I gotta go.

48:55.515 --> 48:56.892
- I got the baked
potato and sides today.

48:56.975 --> 48:59.019
No more frozen pizza for me.

48:59.102 --> 49:00.979
- Yeah, that was pretty gross.

49:01.063 --> 49:02.105
- Yeah.

49:02.189 --> 49:04.149
Did you talk to Vanessa?

49:04.232 --> 49:06.234
- No, she just stormed off.

49:06.318 --> 49:07.944
- (sighs) Typical.

49:08.028 --> 49:09.655
At least you tried.

49:09.738 --> 49:10.614
- Yeah.

49:10.697 --> 49:12.449
- Are you gonna tell your mom?

49:12.532 --> 49:13.241
- No.

49:16.411 --> 49:17.287
- [Millie] Ugh!

49:17.371 --> 49:18.080
- What?

49:18.163 --> 49:19.289
- It's as hard as a rock.

49:20.666 --> 49:21.583
(Brie laughs)

49:21.667 --> 49:23.168
- Dude.

49:23.251 --> 49:25.045
You have got to start
packing your own lunches.

49:25.128 --> 49:27.839
- I know but my mom never
has time in the morning.

49:27.923 --> 49:29.591
- Can't you pack your own?

49:30.634 --> 49:31.802
- Oh.

49:31.885 --> 49:33.387
I guess that's a
better solution.

49:36.306 --> 49:38.308
- So are you gonna
get another potato?

49:38.392 --> 49:40.769
- No, I'll just eat the sides.

49:40.852 --> 49:42.312
- Here you go.

49:42.396 --> 49:44.189
- Oh, thanks.

49:45.065 --> 49:46.274
So do you know what recipe

49:46.358 --> 49:47.609
you're gonna use
for the Bake Off?

49:47.693 --> 49:49.069
I have no idea.

49:49.152 --> 49:50.821
- Yeah, I think a few online.

49:50.904 --> 49:52.197
- [Millie] Ooh, what is it?

49:53.407 --> 49:55.867
- I don't know if
I should tell you.

49:55.951 --> 49:57.077
- I'm not gonna copy you.

49:57.160 --> 49:58.286
- [Brie] Oh yeah, I know.

49:58.370 --> 50:00.080
I just don't think we
should tell each other.

50:00.163 --> 50:02.332
- But we're BFF's and we
tell each other everything.

50:04.710 --> 50:07.087
- Yeah, but we're
kinda competing
against each other, so.

50:07.170 --> 50:08.004
- I was gonna tell you mine

50:08.088 --> 50:09.965
once I figured it out.

50:10.048 --> 50:11.258
- I don't wanna know yours.

50:11.341 --> 50:13.218
- Brie, do you even
think you telling me

50:13.301 --> 50:15.095
is gonna change anything?

50:15.178 --> 50:17.264
- I mean, it could.

50:17.347 --> 50:19.599
You could change yours
after I tell you mine.

50:19.683 --> 50:20.434
- Wow.

50:20.517 --> 50:21.226
You know what?

50:21.309 --> 50:22.769
You're right.

50:22.853 --> 50:24.646
We shouldn't talk about the
recipes or the Bake Off.

50:25.689 --> 50:27.315
Or at all.

50:28.525 --> 50:28.608
- Millie!

50:30.569 --> 50:31.862
Millie, I didn't mean to...

50:32.863 --> 50:34.281
(soft music)

50:38.493 --> 50:40.495
(insects chirping)

50:46.543 --> 50:48.003
- Do you know where
the donuts are?

50:48.086 --> 50:50.046
- You ate them all, remember?

50:50.130 --> 50:51.256
- Dang it.

50:51.339 --> 50:52.799
I thought I had one more left.

50:54.259 --> 50:56.136
What you baking now?

50:56.219 --> 50:57.512
- A lavender vanilla cake.

50:57.596 --> 50:59.097
Are you gonna make
me spill it again?

50:59.181 --> 51:01.183
- No, not today.

51:01.266 --> 51:03.059
What's lavender? No chocolate?

51:03.143 --> 51:04.519
- No, and it's a flower thingy.

51:06.563 --> 51:07.355
- [Peter] Oh.

51:07.439 --> 51:08.648
Can you put chocolate on it?

51:08.732 --> 51:10.650
- I can but I won't.

51:10.734 --> 51:11.943
- Why not?

51:12.027 --> 51:14.112
- Because the recipe
doesn't call for it!

51:14.196 --> 51:16.072
- Okay, sheesh.

51:16.156 --> 51:17.574
What's up with you today?

51:17.657 --> 51:18.408
- Nothing!

51:18.492 --> 51:19.409
Now go away.

51:21.203 --> 51:21.495
Bye. Leave, go.

51:34.090 --> 51:36.384
(timer dings)

51:40.764 --> 51:41.640
- Hey, sweet pea.

51:41.723 --> 51:43.141
- [Brie] Hey, Dad.

51:43.225 --> 51:45.769
- [Jamie] Wow, that looks good.

51:45.852 --> 51:46.728
- Thank you.

51:48.563 --> 51:49.231
All done.

51:49.314 --> 51:50.190
Do you wanna try some?

51:50.273 --> 51:51.983
- Uh, yeah. I'll have some.

51:52.067 --> 51:53.860
Peter, you want some cake?

51:53.944 --> 51:55.821
- [Brie] This is a new
recipe I found online.

51:55.904 --> 51:56.738
- Looks great.
- Yes!

51:56.822 --> 51:58.198
(Brie and Jamie chuckles)

51:58.281 --> 52:00.200
- Oh, that looks so good.

52:01.243 --> 52:02.077
Oh, wow.

52:02.160 --> 52:02.869
Okay, for you.

52:04.538 --> 52:05.413
- Thank you.

52:05.497 --> 52:06.998
- All right, here we go, ready?

52:07.082 --> 52:09.209
Uno, dos, three.

52:12.337 --> 52:13.046
Hmm.

52:14.172 --> 52:15.048
(Jamie coughs)

52:15.131 --> 52:16.216
That's um-

52:16.299 --> 52:18.760
- Nasty. I don't like it.

52:18.844 --> 52:20.846
- Maybe I added
too much lavender?

52:20.929 --> 52:21.638
- Yeah.

52:21.721 --> 52:23.056
Yeah.

52:23.139 --> 52:24.140
It's a little too-

52:24.224 --> 52:25.350
- Gross.

52:25.433 --> 52:27.686
- I was going to say floral.

52:27.769 --> 52:30.105
- Maybe you should
take out the lavender

52:30.188 --> 52:32.816
and add chocolate instead.

52:32.899 --> 52:35.068
- But this recipe got
so many good reviews.

52:35.151 --> 52:36.486
Maybe I messed it up somehow.

52:36.570 --> 52:38.071
- [Jamie] Why don't
you ask your mom?

52:38.154 --> 52:39.865
- [Brie] Oh yeah, she
has a bunch, doesn't she?

52:39.948 --> 52:41.116
- Yeah.

52:41.199 --> 52:42.242
And she'll be picking
you up tomorrow

52:42.325 --> 52:43.910
for your doctor's appointment.

52:43.994 --> 52:45.370
- I thought you were taking me.

52:45.453 --> 52:47.414
- Yeah, I have a call I
have to deal with now.

52:47.497 --> 52:48.915
- Okay.
- Wait.

52:48.999 --> 52:51.293
You're getting out
early tomorrow?

52:51.376 --> 52:52.419
- Yep.

52:52.502 --> 52:54.045
I can't wait to get
rid of this thing.

52:54.129 --> 52:55.881
- [Jamie] Well your mom
should be home soon.

52:55.964 --> 52:57.173
- [Brie] Okay.

52:57.257 --> 52:58.174
- Here, let me help
you clean this up.

52:58.258 --> 52:59.301
Give me that

52:59.384 --> 53:00.093
and that.

53:00.176 --> 53:00.886
All right.

53:03.054 --> 53:04.639
- [Peter] Get that outta here.

53:04.723 --> 53:07.392
(Brie chuckles)

53:07.475 --> 53:08.643
- Mom?

53:08.727 --> 53:10.228
- Yeah, sweetie?

53:10.312 --> 53:11.521
- Do you have any recipes
I can use for the Bake Off?

53:13.565 --> 53:15.609
- I'm sorry. What?

53:15.692 --> 53:17.110
- [Brie] Do you have
any recipes I can use

53:17.193 --> 53:18.778
to practice with
for the Bake Off?

53:18.862 --> 53:20.280
- Oh yeah, of course.

53:20.363 --> 53:21.656
I completely forgot about those.

53:23.658 --> 53:25.660
I'm trying to think
where I put them though.

53:29.289 --> 53:31.124
- Is everything okay with work?

53:31.207 --> 53:31.958
- Yes.

53:33.335 --> 53:34.377
I'm just finishing up

53:34.461 --> 53:36.171
a couple last
minute things here.

53:36.254 --> 53:38.089
They should be in the kitchen.

53:38.173 --> 53:38.882
Let's go.

53:47.474 --> 53:47.641
Let's see.

53:57.484 --> 53:59.069
Oh, here they are.

54:04.866 --> 54:06.743
- [Brie] Whoa, these
recipes are in cursive.

54:06.826 --> 54:09.037
- [Marcy] Yeah, old
school handwriting.

54:09.120 --> 54:10.830
- I don't know how
to write in cursive.

54:10.914 --> 54:12.165
- Are you serious?

54:12.248 --> 54:13.583
They're not teaching
you that in school?

54:13.667 --> 54:14.334
- Nope.

54:14.417 --> 54:15.752
Well, just my name.

54:15.835 --> 54:15.919
- Wow.

54:18.505 --> 54:20.131
Oh, here.

54:20.215 --> 54:22.300
This one's my favorite.

54:22.384 --> 54:25.011
- Black forest gateo...

54:25.095 --> 54:27.013
- Black forest gateaux.

54:27.097 --> 54:29.349
It has chocolate
and cherries and...

54:29.432 --> 54:31.559
Oh, it is so good.

54:31.643 --> 54:33.061
- Thank you.

54:33.144 --> 54:34.729
- This one will definitely
impress the judges.

54:34.813 --> 54:35.689
- Thanks, Mom.

54:35.772 --> 54:37.315
Can we practice this tomorrow?

54:37.399 --> 54:39.317
- Yeah, sure.
That'll be perfect.

54:39.401 --> 54:41.611
You wanna invite Millie
along to practice too?

54:41.695 --> 54:44.447
- Um, we're not really
talking right now.

54:44.531 --> 54:45.365
- [Marcy] Sweetie, why?

54:45.448 --> 54:46.533
- Because I wouldn't tell her

54:46.616 --> 54:48.284
what I was making
for the Bake Off.

54:48.368 --> 54:50.203
- Well that seems unfair of her

54:50.286 --> 54:52.080
and for the rest of the
kids in the Bake Off.

54:52.163 --> 54:52.998
- That's what I was thinking.

54:53.081 --> 54:54.499
- Well did you tell her that?

54:54.582 --> 54:56.501
- No, she just stormed off.

54:56.584 --> 54:57.627
- Well, I'm sure
she'll understand

54:57.711 --> 54:59.504
as soon as you talk to her.

54:59.587 --> 55:00.463
- Yeah.

55:02.757 --> 55:05.010
This recipe looks
really hard, Mom.

55:05.093 --> 55:06.386
- I know you can do it.

55:08.596 --> 55:09.514
- I hope so.

55:10.598 --> 55:13.768
- Well, let's leave these here.

55:13.852 --> 55:14.936
It's getting late.

55:15.020 --> 55:17.022
And let's get ready for bed.

55:17.105 --> 55:18.398
- [Brie] Okay. Thanks, Mamma.

55:18.481 --> 55:18.690
- Oh, you're welcome.

55:24.487 --> 55:27.073
(birds chirping)

55:28.074 --> 55:29.743
(gentle music)

55:40.503 --> 55:41.379
- 9:37?

55:42.630 --> 55:44.090
Dad!

55:44.174 --> 55:44.883
Mom!

55:49.721 --> 55:50.597
Dad!

55:50.680 --> 55:51.556
Why didn't you wake me?

55:51.639 --> 55:52.432
I'm gonna be late for school!

55:52.515 --> 55:54.309
- Sweetie, everything is fine.

55:54.392 --> 55:56.519
You don't have school today.

55:56.603 --> 55:57.854
- What? How come?

55:57.937 --> 55:59.606
- Well, there was a fire

55:59.689 --> 56:00.607
in your school last night.

56:00.690 --> 56:01.941
- A fire?

56:02.025 --> 56:02.692
What happened?

56:02.776 --> 56:03.610
Did anyone get hurt?

56:03.693 --> 56:05.528
- Thankfully nobody got hurt.

56:05.612 --> 56:06.863
But apparently the ovens

56:06.946 --> 56:09.157
never fully shut off like
they were supposed to

56:09.240 --> 56:10.658
and, well, exploded
in the kitchen.

56:10.742 --> 56:11.826
- Exploded?

56:11.910 --> 56:13.536
- Luckily the kitchen
has metal doors

56:13.620 --> 56:15.747
so the fire was
somewhat contained.

56:15.830 --> 56:18.041
I read the rest of
the cafeteria is fine.

56:19.125 --> 56:20.376
- What? Oh my gosh.

56:20.460 --> 56:21.544
Dad, is there still
gonna be a Bake Off?

56:21.628 --> 56:24.589
- Sweetie, everything
will be fine.

56:24.672 --> 56:26.674
They're probably figuring
that out right now.

56:27.926 --> 56:29.135
- What are we gonna do?

56:29.219 --> 56:30.762
- Why aren't we in
the faculty lounge?

56:30.845 --> 56:33.515
- Because the aura in
here is much better

56:33.598 --> 56:34.724
than in that hole.

56:35.725 --> 56:36.810
- Okay.

56:36.893 --> 56:38.645
- It does smell
really good in here.

56:38.728 --> 56:40.146
- Thank you, Lester.

56:40.230 --> 56:44.567
That's my calm mind and
confidence boost essential oils.

56:44.651 --> 56:46.778
You know it's really good
for muscle tension too.

56:46.861 --> 56:48.404
- You know, I've heard of those

56:48.488 --> 56:49.531
but I'm not sure I
could find a diffuser

56:49.614 --> 56:51.074
big enough for the entire gym.

56:51.157 --> 56:53.576
- I could help you
look for one in stores.

56:53.660 --> 56:55.036
That store Big Buys
might have something.

56:55.120 --> 56:57.497
- Oh, don't be silly, Lester.

56:57.580 --> 56:59.290
You can borrow my
essential oils.

56:59.374 --> 57:00.792
That way you can try them out.

57:00.875 --> 57:02.710
- Okay, thanks, guys.
- Mm-hmm!

57:02.794 --> 57:04.379
- All right, everyone.

57:04.462 --> 57:05.713
Let's try and focus here.

57:08.341 --> 57:10.802
Ms. Henderson, what did the
fireman say the damage was?

57:13.638 --> 57:16.141
- He said an estimated $20,000.

57:16.224 --> 57:17.851
- What?
- Oh my Lanta.

57:19.060 --> 57:22.522
- Ms. Silvera, did you
see how much contingency

57:22.605 --> 57:23.773
we have in our budget?

57:23.857 --> 57:27.318
- Yes, we ran out of
contingency two months ago.

57:27.402 --> 57:28.736
- How is that possible?

57:28.820 --> 57:29.946
- [Ms. Silvera] The bathroom
leak on the third floor

57:30.029 --> 57:32.532
really took a hit to
our budget this year.

57:32.615 --> 57:35.410
- Well, what about DCBX?

57:35.493 --> 57:38.204
They're the ones sponsoring
the Bake Off prize money.

57:38.288 --> 57:39.914
Why not ask them for
help with the kitchen?

57:39.998 --> 57:43.418
- Well, I'm afraid
even if they did help,

57:43.501 --> 57:46.671
the kitchen would not be
done before next week.

57:46.754 --> 57:47.839
- The parents are
gonna have a fit

57:47.922 --> 57:48.798
if we don't have this Bake Off.

57:48.882 --> 57:50.300
- Well, I know.

57:50.383 --> 57:51.593
- I'm not...

57:51.676 --> 57:52.719
No.

57:52.802 --> 57:53.678
- What if we have
it in the summer?

57:53.761 --> 57:55.013
(Ms. Silvera laughs)

57:55.096 --> 57:56.264
- Oh wait, I got it!

57:57.724 --> 58:00.310
Why don't we just do a no
bake Bake Off Challenge.

58:01.394 --> 58:02.145
- [Ms. Melanie] Hmm.

58:03.646 --> 58:06.691
- Bake, no bake Bake Off.

58:06.774 --> 58:09.235
- I guess that could work.

58:09.319 --> 58:10.403
- I mean, it can.

58:10.486 --> 58:12.447
I make no bake
bakes all the time.

58:12.530 --> 58:13.239
- What?

58:13.323 --> 58:14.949
You bake too?

58:15.033 --> 58:18.453
- Yeah, on my days
off with my nieces.

58:18.536 --> 58:19.704
- Wow.

58:19.787 --> 58:22.207
- That's the sweetest
thing I've ever heard.

58:22.290 --> 58:24.751
- Lester, I think you just saved

58:24.834 --> 58:26.127
the Bake Off Challenge.

58:27.420 --> 58:31.007
- I think I'm in love
with this new plan.

58:31.090 --> 58:31.758
- Yeah, me too.

58:31.841 --> 58:33.509
What do we do next?

58:34.928 --> 58:37.347
- Well, we'll announce it
first thing tomorrow morning.

58:37.430 --> 58:38.640
In the meantime,

58:38.723 --> 58:41.017
let's figure out what
changes we have to make.

58:41.100 --> 58:43.603
(bright playful music)

58:43.686 --> 58:44.395
(Mr. Claymore sighs)

58:44.479 --> 58:45.188
- All right.

58:46.564 --> 58:48.358
Oh, you're getting some paper.

58:48.441 --> 58:50.026
- Oh, Lester, you
didn't come prepared.

58:50.109 --> 58:51.194
There you go.

58:51.277 --> 58:51.861
- Thank you.

58:54.447 --> 58:57.575
(students chattering)

59:01.704 --> 59:02.622
- [Maxine] Hey!

59:02.705 --> 59:04.082
You got your cast off.

59:04.165 --> 59:05.250
- Yeah.

59:05.333 --> 59:06.626
- [Maxine] Where do
you think you're going?

59:06.709 --> 59:07.835
- To class.

59:07.919 --> 59:10.046
- Your arm looks so much better.

59:10.129 --> 59:10.213
- Yeah.

59:17.512 --> 59:19.681
- Can't wait to play
dodge ball with you again.

59:19.764 --> 59:21.391
Maybe we'll get your other arm.

59:22.308 --> 59:24.227
- Hey! Come on, let's go.

59:29.691 --> 59:30.608
- I'm so mad about the fire.

59:30.692 --> 59:32.819
(school bell rings)

59:34.821 --> 59:36.239
- All right, everyone.

59:36.322 --> 59:39.284
Settle down, settle down.

59:39.367 --> 59:42.370
I have some news this
morning to pass onto you.

59:43.705 --> 59:45.039
As you all know, we
had a bit of a fire

59:45.123 --> 59:49.127
in the cafeteria kitchen
a couple of nights ago.

59:49.210 --> 59:52.755
Luckily, the damage
was contained.

59:52.839 --> 59:55.508
However, our ovens
for the Bake Off

59:55.591 --> 59:57.010
are completely destroyed.

59:58.219 --> 1:00:00.179
So, who are my
contestants, please?

1:00:00.263 --> 1:00:01.472
Raise your hands.

1:00:02.849 --> 1:00:04.684
You four will now compete

1:00:04.767 --> 1:00:07.937
in a No Bake Bake Off Challenge.

1:00:08.021 --> 1:00:12.358
Like last year, the first two
challenges will be a surprise

1:00:12.442 --> 1:00:15.361
and you'll have 15
minutes to complete it.

1:00:15.445 --> 1:00:18.281
As for the third
and final challenge,

1:00:18.364 --> 1:00:19.741
unlike last year,

1:00:19.824 --> 1:00:23.036
instead of you baking a cake
for the ultimate showdown,

1:00:23.119 --> 1:00:24.579
you will now be making

1:00:24.662 --> 1:00:29.125
an Ultimate Spring No Bake
Cheesecake, all right?

1:00:29.208 --> 1:00:33.713
Don't forget next Friday we
will have early dismissal.

1:00:33.796 --> 1:00:37.633
Now any students who are not
participating in the Bake Off

1:00:37.717 --> 1:00:39.927
please be sure to be there

1:00:40.011 --> 1:00:42.305
to cheer your peers on.

1:00:42.388 --> 1:00:44.182
Does anybody have any questions?

1:00:45.558 --> 1:00:47.352
Oh, Vanessa.

1:00:47.435 --> 1:00:49.562
- We're still having it
in the cafeteria, right?

1:00:49.645 --> 1:00:50.355
- Yes.

1:00:50.438 --> 1:00:51.731
And in the meantime,

1:00:51.814 --> 1:00:54.484
we'll be having our lunches
here in the classroom.

1:00:54.567 --> 1:00:55.902
Okay.

1:00:55.985 --> 1:00:58.071
All right, now if everyone
will open their book

1:00:58.154 --> 1:01:01.074
to page 133, we'll read the poem

1:01:01.157 --> 1:01:03.993
"A Chance I Have"
by Kate Miller.

1:01:13.252 --> 1:01:14.962
All right, go ahead.

1:01:15.046 --> 1:01:16.839
- [Student] Yes, Ms. Melanie.

1:01:16.923 --> 1:01:18.966
"A Chance I Have"
by Kate Miller.

1:01:20.176 --> 1:01:21.302
Chances come and go.

1:01:22.387 --> 1:01:24.389
Some we take, some we miss.

1:01:25.890 --> 1:01:27.058
- [Brie] I'm sorry.

1:01:27.141 --> 1:01:28.434
I didn't mean to
make you mad at me.

1:01:29.435 --> 1:01:31.854
- [Millie] No, I'm sorry.

1:01:31.938 --> 1:01:33.272
I was being a ding-dong.

1:01:36.567 --> 1:01:38.194
- [Brie] Well now I really
don't know what to do.

1:01:38.277 --> 1:01:38.945
A No Bake Bake Off?

1:01:43.324 --> 1:01:44.909
- [Millie] I know, right?

1:01:44.992 --> 1:01:47.120
Well, don't tell me.

1:01:47.203 --> 1:01:48.121
I don't wanna know.

1:01:52.041 --> 1:01:53.459
- [Student] And the chance
I have each and every day.

1:01:53.543 --> 1:01:55.503
A chance I often miss

1:01:55.586 --> 1:01:57.880
and a chance I often run from.

1:01:57.964 --> 1:01:59.674
- [Ms. Melanie]
Brie, next verse.

1:02:01.634 --> 1:02:02.677
- And the chance I have

1:02:02.760 --> 1:02:03.928
is the chance I have

1:02:04.011 --> 1:02:04.971
that makes life worth
taking another breath.

1:02:06.222 --> 1:02:08.683
- [Ms. Melanie]
Millie, next verse.

1:02:12.061 --> 1:02:14.147
(insects chirping)

1:02:19.235 --> 1:02:21.279
- [Jamie] Get some
rest, sweet pea.

1:02:21.362 --> 1:02:22.738
- You're gonna do
great tomorrow, honey.

1:02:22.822 --> 1:02:23.990
- We got all the ingredients

1:02:24.073 --> 1:02:25.700
for the cheesecake, right, Mom?

1:02:25.783 --> 1:02:27.869
- Yes, I checked five times.

1:02:27.952 --> 1:02:28.870
- [Brie] Okay.

1:02:28.953 --> 1:02:30.830
- How's your arm doing?

1:02:30.913 --> 1:02:31.706
- It's a little stiff

1:02:31.789 --> 1:02:33.916
but it's so, so much better.

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:35.918
- Well no matter what
happens tomorrow,

1:02:36.002 --> 1:02:37.044
we're proud of you.

1:02:37.128 --> 1:02:38.379
- Thanks, Dad. Goodnight.

1:02:39.422 --> 1:02:40.590
- Goodnight, baby.

1:02:40.673 --> 1:02:41.632
- Goodnight, sweetie.

1:02:43.176 --> 1:02:44.010
- Goodnight, Mamma.

1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:55.396
(insects chirping)
(dog barking in distance)

1:03:00.276 --> 1:03:02.320
- Dad! You're home so late.

1:03:03.946 --> 1:03:04.906
- I know.

1:03:04.989 --> 1:03:06.449
Crazy day today.

1:03:06.532 --> 1:03:09.660
- [Vanessa] I still need
to go to the grocery store.

1:03:09.744 --> 1:03:11.162
- We'll go tomorrow.

1:03:11.245 --> 1:03:13.414
- [Vanessa] Dad,
I can't tomorrow.

1:03:13.498 --> 1:03:15.666
Hello? The Bake Off.

1:03:16.626 --> 1:03:17.835
- [Eugene] That's tomorrow?

1:03:17.919 --> 1:03:20.963
- Yeah, I told you
like 100 times.

1:03:21.047 --> 1:03:24.050
- Hey, don't take that
tone with me, young lady.

1:03:24.133 --> 1:03:25.218
- Did you forget?

1:03:26.469 --> 1:03:27.136
- [Eugene] No.

1:03:28.429 --> 1:03:30.181
- [Vanessa] Can we
please just go now?

1:03:30.264 --> 1:03:32.266
(stomach growling)

1:03:32.350 --> 1:03:33.226
- All right.

1:03:34.936 --> 1:03:35.853
Let's go.

1:03:51.994 --> 1:03:56.165
(birds chirping)
(soft music)

1:04:05.091 --> 1:04:08.553
(soft suspenseful music)

1:04:34.036 --> 1:04:35.162
(students chattering)

1:04:35.246 --> 1:04:38.583
(bright cheerful music)

1:05:04.025 --> 1:05:05.109
- Wow.

1:05:05.192 --> 1:05:07.486
There are a lot of people here.

1:05:07.570 --> 1:05:08.321
- Oh hey, there's Barb.

1:05:08.404 --> 1:05:09.238
Hey, Barb, come here.

1:05:09.322 --> 1:05:10.364
We saved you a seat.

1:05:10.448 --> 1:05:11.282
- [Barb] Okay, great.

1:05:14.827 --> 1:05:15.911
- I don't believe we've met.

1:05:15.995 --> 1:05:16.704
I'm Jamie.

1:05:16.787 --> 1:05:17.705
- Hi, I'm Don Fisher.

1:05:17.788 --> 1:05:18.956
- Nice to meet you.

1:05:19.040 --> 1:05:20.082
- Samantha.

1:05:20.166 --> 1:05:21.167
- How are you doing, Samantha?

1:05:21.250 --> 1:05:22.335
Who are you all
rooting for today?

1:05:22.418 --> 1:05:24.170
- Oh, we're rooting for Jody.

1:05:24.253 --> 1:05:26.130
He's the only boy in
the contest this year.

1:05:26.213 --> 1:05:28.132
- Oh, nice, nice.

1:05:28.215 --> 1:05:29.425
Jody?

1:05:29.508 --> 1:05:31.052
Isn't that a girl's name?

1:05:31.135 --> 1:05:32.762
- Jody is short for Joseph.

1:05:32.845 --> 1:05:33.304
Kinda like Jamie.

1:05:36.098 --> 1:05:37.850
(Jamie chuckles)

1:05:37.933 --> 1:05:39.435
- Right, right.

1:05:39.518 --> 1:05:42.396
Marcy, meet Jody's parents.

1:05:42.480 --> 1:05:44.857
- Oh, hi. Marcy Hayes.

1:05:44.940 --> 1:05:45.399
- Hi, Samantha.

1:05:47.276 --> 1:05:49.028
- Our daughter is Brie.

1:05:49.111 --> 1:05:51.072
- That's wonderful.

1:05:51.155 --> 1:05:53.741
Jody has been
practicing nonstop.

1:05:53.824 --> 1:05:54.909
- [Jamie] Right, right.

1:06:00.706 --> 1:06:02.124
- [Marcy] Have you seen Eugene?

1:06:02.208 --> 1:06:03.167
- Who?

1:06:03.250 --> 1:06:04.168
- Vanessa's dad.

1:06:04.251 --> 1:06:05.127
- Oh, oh.

1:06:05.211 --> 1:06:07.088
(soft music)

1:06:07.171 --> 1:06:07.880
No.

1:06:09.256 --> 1:06:11.050
Are you gonna say
something to him?

1:06:11.133 --> 1:06:11.842
- No.

1:06:11.926 --> 1:06:13.135
But he should be here.

1:06:13.219 --> 1:06:15.137
All the other parents are.

1:06:15.221 --> 1:06:16.138
- I know.

1:06:21.644 --> 1:06:25.064
(soft suspenseful music)

1:06:33.364 --> 1:06:36.701

I see you brought the big prize.

1:06:49.964 --> 1:06:51.090
- Yes, of course.

1:06:51.173 --> 1:06:52.883
- This must be your wife, Betty.

1:06:52.967 --> 1:06:54.593

1:07:05.855 --> 1:07:07.523

Beautiful.

1:07:56.238 --> 1:07:56.947
Woo!

1:07:59.241 --> 1:07:59.950

1:08:04.330 --> 1:08:06.457

Ms. Silvera.

1:08:29.313 --> 1:08:30.356
And Ms. Henderson.

1:08:36.862 --> 1:08:38.405
They will be judging
the contestants

1:08:38.489 --> 1:08:40.866
on presentation, creativity,

1:08:40.950 --> 1:08:42.785
and of course taste.

1:08:43.953 --> 1:08:45.830
All right, the game plan.

1:08:45.913 --> 1:08:48.207
(playful music)

1:08:48.290 --> 1:08:50.709
Just take care of her, okay?

1:08:50.793 --> 1:08:53.254
(Velcro ripping)

1:08:53.337 --> 1:08:56.799
There will be three No

1:08:56.882 --> 1:08:58.217
For the first two rounds

1:08:58.300 --> 1:09:00.094
the bakers will have 15 minutes

1:09:00.177 --> 1:09:01.512

I, Lester, will be

1:09:08.519 --> 1:09:10.396
Once I say time, bakers,
hands off your bakes.

1:09:12.356 --> 1:09:13.065
Got that?

1:09:20.364 --> 1:09:23.158

Get the table.

1:09:42.219 --> 1:09:42.928

1:09:47.600 --> 1:09:50.269

Your first challenge

Lester, the time.

1:10:05.576 --> 1:10:08.579
Ready, set,

1:10:35.439 --> 1:10:37.399

1:10:41.946 --> 1:10:44.615
(microwave beeps)

1:10:49.328 --> 1:10:49.662
- Where is he?

1:10:54.959 --> 1:10:57.294
- Five minutes left, bakers.

1:11:22.528 --> 1:11:23.696
20 seconds left.

1:11:23.779 --> 1:11:25.698
Remember, presentation
is important.

1:11:32.579 --> 1:11:33.372
Five, four,

1:11:34.748 --> 1:11:37.918
three, two, one.

1:11:38.002 --> 1:11:38.919
And that's time.

1:11:39.003 --> 1:11:39.920
Hands off your bakes.

1:11:40.004 --> 1:11:43.090
(audience applauding)

1:11:51.348 --> 1:11:51.682
- That was crazy.

1:11:54.768 --> 1:11:58.397
- I can't wait to see
what happens here.

1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:02.526
- You know, we should really
get two of these next time.

1:12:02.609 --> 1:12:03.318
- I agree.

1:12:04.778 --> 1:12:08.032
- Contestants, please step
forward with your bakes

1:12:08.115 --> 1:12:09.783

(soft music)

1:12:11.869 --> 1:12:14.997
(audience chattering)

1:12:47.154 --> 1:12:48.781
(Millie sighs)

1:12:55.704 --> 1:12:57.915
- I'm just gonna write yaas.

1:13:03.629 --> 1:13:05.547
Millie did great
with the sprinkles,

1:13:05.631 --> 1:13:07.800
and the jelly beans are a
nice touch too over here.

1:13:12.554 --> 1:13:16.058
- I wonder how they're gonna-
- I don't know.

1:13:20.562 --> 1:13:22.523
- It's really intense.

1:13:24.316 --> 1:13:25.400
- Oh my goodness.

1:13:25.484 --> 1:13:28.362
What a wonderful
suspenseful first round.

1:13:28.445 --> 1:13:30.447
We will now take
a 15 minute break

1:13:30.531 --> 1:13:32.157
to set up for the next round.

1:13:32.241 --> 1:13:33.283
Thank you.

1:13:33.367 --> 1:13:36.161
(bright music)

1:13:36.245 --> 1:13:37.663
- [All] Hi, Jody.

1:13:37.746 --> 1:13:38.789
- Hello.

1:13:38.872 --> 1:13:39.748
- That looked amazing.
- It really did.

1:13:39.832 --> 1:13:40.999
- It was like incredible.

1:13:41.083 --> 1:13:42.584
- Where did you learn
to bake that good?

1:13:42.668 --> 1:13:44.169
- My dad's a baker.

1:13:44.253 --> 1:13:46.505
- Wow.
- That's so cool.

1:13:46.588 --> 1:13:48.590
- Thanks.
- The way you stirred

1:13:48.674 --> 1:13:50.884
the batter with your
wrist was perfect.

1:13:50.968 --> 1:13:52.427
The technique is on point.

1:13:52.511 --> 1:13:53.429
- It was.

1:13:53.512 --> 1:13:54.304
- Thank you.

1:13:56.723 --> 1:13:58.058
- You did great, Millie bear.

1:13:58.142 --> 1:13:59.143
So proud of you!

1:14:02.104 --> 1:14:03.522
- Thanks, Mamma.

1:14:03.605 --> 1:14:05.816
(Barb laughs)

1:14:05.899 --> 1:14:07.401
- You did so great, honey.

1:14:07.484 --> 1:14:08.610
- Thanks, Mom.

1:14:08.694 --> 1:14:10.696
- That was intense.
- Yeah.

1:14:10.779 --> 1:14:12.656
- Can I have some of
the stuff you made?

1:14:12.739 --> 1:14:15.534
- Um, I'm pretty sure they're
cleaning up right now.

1:14:15.617 --> 1:14:16.618
- Dang it.

1:14:16.702 --> 1:14:17.828
- Sorry.

1:14:17.911 --> 1:14:18.954
- You gotta wait
your turn, mister.

1:14:19.872 --> 1:14:23.125
- Um, I'll be right back.

1:14:24.293 --> 1:14:25.502
- [Jamie] Okay.

1:14:26.628 --> 1:14:29.047
(soft music)

1:14:56.658 --> 1:14:59.328
- Vanessa, are you okay?

1:14:59.411 --> 1:14:59.828
- [Vanessa] Go away, Brie.

1:15:01.663 --> 1:15:03.373
- I'm sorry your dad isn't here.

1:15:06.543 --> 1:15:07.628
I just wanted to tell you

1:15:07.711 --> 1:15:09.379
that if you ever need anything

1:15:09.463 --> 1:15:10.964
you can count on me,

1:15:11.048 --> 1:15:13.467
even if you make my life
miserable sometimes.

1:15:13.550 --> 1:15:15.761
- Brie, I don't
wanna talk to you.

1:15:15.844 --> 1:15:17.512
Now go away!

1:15:17.596 --> 1:15:18.972
- You know what?

1:15:19.056 --> 1:15:20.098
Maybe if you weren't such
a brat all of the time,

1:15:20.182 --> 1:15:23.143
your friends would be in
here trying to help you.

1:15:23.227 --> 1:15:25.729
Instead, they're out
there talking to Jody.

1:15:25.812 --> 1:15:27.147
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

1:15:27.231 --> 1:15:29.483
- [Brie] I'm just
trying to help.

1:15:29.566 --> 1:15:30.692
- I don't need your help.

1:15:30.776 --> 1:15:32.486
Now go away or I'll-

1:15:32.569 --> 1:15:33.737
- You'll what?

1:15:33.820 --> 1:15:36.657
Call me names, embarrass
me in front of everyone,

1:15:36.740 --> 1:15:38.367
break my arm?

1:15:38.450 --> 1:15:40.869
Oh wait, you've already
done all those things.

1:15:42.162 --> 1:15:43.997
I don't even know why
I try with you anymore.

1:16:02.641 --> 1:16:05.060
- We will now start
the second challenge.

1:16:05.143 --> 1:16:07.938
One of my favorite
desserts growing up,

1:16:08.021 --> 1:16:12.901
this is my Auntie
May's marvelous no
bake banana pudding.

1:16:14.486 --> 1:16:18.407
You will have exactly 15 minutes
to complete this challenge.

1:16:18.490 --> 1:16:20.033
Lester, are you ready?

1:16:20.117 --> 1:16:20.826
(playful music)

1:16:20.909 --> 1:16:21.827
- I was born for this.

1:16:22.786 --> 1:16:23.787
- Yeah, you were.

1:16:25.789 --> 1:16:28.792
- Ready, set,

1:16:28.875 --> 1:16:30.085
bake!
(timer beeps)

1:16:30.168 --> 1:16:33.839
(audience applauding)
(bright cheerful music)

1:16:51.690 --> 1:16:52.774
- Oh my gosh.

1:16:52.858 --> 1:16:54.443
There's a lot of
mixing in this one.

1:16:54.526 --> 1:16:55.986
- Focus, Brie. 15 minutes.

1:16:57.321 --> 1:16:58.488
- Come on, Brie, hustle.

1:17:07.497 --> 1:17:08.206
- Let's go, Jody.

1:17:08.290 --> 1:17:09.249
Mix it all together.

1:17:09.333 --> 1:17:10.417
- This is a tough one.

1:17:10.500 --> 1:17:12.169
- I know. I am so nervous.

1:17:16.590 --> 1:17:18.008
- [Jamie] How much time is left?

1:17:20.260 --> 1:17:22.137
- Three minutes,
bakers. Three minutes.

1:17:29.311 --> 1:17:31.021
(Vanessa yawns)

1:18:12.270 --> 1:18:14.648
(soft music)

1:18:26.910 --> 1:18:28.412
- Oh no.

1:18:28.495 --> 1:18:30.372
- Brie, Vanessa just left.

1:18:32.374 --> 1:18:33.875
- [Brie] Whatever.

1:18:37.879 --> 1:18:39.631
- I hope she's okay.

1:18:40.882 --> 1:18:45.804
- And that's five,
four, three, two, one.

1:18:46.555 --> 1:18:47.305
Time! Hands up, bakers.

1:18:47.389 --> 1:18:50.851
(audience applauding)

1:18:50.934 --> 1:18:53.645
- It's getting hot in here, wow.

1:18:59.359 --> 1:19:00.902
- Bakers, please bring
your banana puddings

1:19:00.986 --> 1:19:01.820
up to the judging table.

1:19:01.903 --> 1:19:04.030
(audience chattering)

1:19:12.998 --> 1:19:15.500
(light music)

1:19:22.215 --> 1:19:24.134
- Yeah, I think that
one looks the best.

1:19:24.217 --> 1:19:26.845
I mean, that one's missing
cookies altogether.

1:19:26.928 --> 1:19:27.971
Oh yeah, that's Vanessa.

1:19:28.054 --> 1:19:30.015
We're still gonna have
to deduct the points.

1:19:30.098 --> 1:19:31.600
- I think she tried.

1:19:31.683 --> 1:19:32.893
- Yeah, but I'm
still gonna have to

1:19:32.976 --> 1:19:35.187
give her zero points
for presentation.

1:19:41.401 --> 1:19:42.027
- Mm-mm.

1:19:44.070 --> 1:19:44.779
- [Samantha] Yes, Jody!

1:19:44.863 --> 1:19:47.991
(audience applauding)

1:19:50.702 --> 1:19:51.828
- Oh my god.

1:19:51.912 --> 1:19:53.497
That is the best
pudding I've ever had.

1:19:53.580 --> 1:19:54.873
But we can't show them.

1:19:54.956 --> 1:19:58.919
(Mr. Claymore exhales deeply)

1:19:59.002 --> 1:19:59.836
- Why am I not floating up

1:19:59.920 --> 1:20:01.087
in an angel cloud right now?

1:20:01.171 --> 1:20:01.254
This is amazing.

1:20:04.257 --> 1:20:06.301
(soft tense music)

1:20:06.384 --> 1:20:11.264
This is so good.
- It is so good.

1:20:11.348 --> 1:20:11.431
- Mm.

1:20:13.308 --> 1:20:13.391
Okay.

1:20:19.773 --> 1:20:20.607
- Yep.
- Okay.

1:20:20.690 --> 1:20:21.107
- You guys ready?

1:20:28.657 --> 1:20:29.824
- How's your arm feeling?

1:20:29.908 --> 1:20:31.034
- It hurts a bit.

1:20:32.285 --> 1:20:34.079
I can't believe she
just walked out.

1:20:34.162 --> 1:20:37.082
- Yeah, her dad isn't here.

1:20:38.083 --> 1:20:39.000
- I know.

1:20:43.421 --> 1:20:45.382
- Are you okay?

1:20:45.465 --> 1:20:46.424
- Yeah.

1:20:46.508 --> 1:20:48.510
- Where are your parents?

1:20:48.593 --> 1:20:49.844
- I don't know where my dad is.

1:20:49.928 --> 1:20:50.220
- What about your mom?

1:20:52.931 --> 1:20:54.349
- I don't have one anymore.

1:20:56.017 --> 1:20:58.436
- Oh my gosh, I am so sorry.

1:20:58.520 --> 1:20:59.938
I had no idea.

1:21:00.021 --> 1:21:00.939
- It's fine.

1:21:04.317 --> 1:21:05.026
- Vanessa.

1:21:05.110 --> 1:21:06.027
- [Vanessa] Dad!

1:21:07.404 --> 1:21:09.281
- I'm so sorry, Vanessa.

1:21:09.364 --> 1:21:10.699
I tried leaving early

1:21:10.782 --> 1:21:12.284
but my boss wouldn't let me go.

1:21:12.367 --> 1:21:14.327
- You missed like
almost all of it.

1:21:14.411 --> 1:21:14.494
- I know.

1:21:16.037 --> 1:21:16.246
But I'm here now.

1:21:18.957 --> 1:21:20.125
Please don't be mad.

1:21:20.208 --> 1:21:21.918
- I thought you weren't
gonna come at all.

1:21:22.002 --> 1:21:23.962
You're the worst dad ever.

1:21:24.045 --> 1:21:26.464
(soft music)

1:21:26.548 --> 1:21:28.008
- I can't tell you
how hard it's been

1:21:28.091 --> 1:21:29.342
not having your mom around.

1:21:32.053 --> 1:21:33.555
I can't do everything myself.

1:21:34.556 --> 1:21:35.807
- You're never home

1:21:35.890 --> 1:21:37.893
and you never care
about anything I do.

1:21:37.976 --> 1:21:38.935
I hate you.

1:21:42.022 --> 1:21:44.065
- Please understand, Vanessa.

1:21:45.066 --> 1:21:46.443
I'm so sorry.

1:21:47.485 --> 1:21:49.154
- I just wanna go home.

1:21:49.237 --> 1:21:50.238
I already messed up
in the second round.

1:21:52.532 --> 1:21:55.160
- Sweetie, if your mother
were here right now,

1:21:55.243 --> 1:21:56.202
she'd be so proud of you.

1:21:57.996 --> 1:21:59.914
- I want to go home.

1:21:59.998 --> 1:22:00.373
- Come on, Vanessa.

1:22:03.209 --> 1:22:04.044
- Come on, Vanessa.

1:22:04.127 --> 1:22:05.837
You still have a chance.

1:22:05.920 --> 1:22:07.422
- [Vanessa] But I
already messed up.

1:22:07.505 --> 1:22:08.965
- So what?

1:22:09.049 --> 1:22:11.593
This last challenge is
what matters most anyway.

1:22:11.676 --> 1:22:13.303
- All right,
children. It's time.

1:22:15.805 --> 1:22:16.640
Mr. Weiler.

1:22:16.723 --> 1:22:19.017
I haven't seen you in a while.

1:22:19.100 --> 1:22:20.894
- [Eugene] Yes, apologies.

1:22:20.977 --> 1:22:21.936
- Well, please have a seat.

1:22:22.020 --> 1:22:23.938
We're about to start.

1:22:24.022 --> 1:22:24.731
Come on.

1:22:24.814 --> 1:22:27.442
(pleasant music)

1:22:30.028 --> 1:22:30.737
- [Vanessa] Thanks, Jody.

1:22:30.820 --> 1:22:32.238
- Don't mention it.

1:22:43.667 --> 1:22:46.378
(audience chattering)

1:22:46.461 --> 1:22:50.423
- Bakers, this is your
third and final challenge.

1:22:50.507 --> 1:22:52.008
You have your
ingredients with you

1:22:52.092 --> 1:22:53.969
that you brought from home.

1:22:54.052 --> 1:22:57.097
You will have 45
minutes to create

1:22:57.180 --> 1:23:00.850
the Ultimate Spring
No Bake Cheesecake.

1:23:01.976 --> 1:23:03.269
Okay, ready?

1:23:03.353 --> 1:23:04.521
Okay.

1:23:04.604 --> 1:23:06.690
Ready, set,

1:23:06.773 --> 1:23:07.565
bake!

1:23:07.649 --> 1:23:10.276
(upbeat music)

1:23:10.360 --> 1:23:11.361
- Go Vanessa!

1:23:12.570 --> 1:23:14.280
- [Don] You got this, Jody!

1:23:14.364 --> 1:23:17.492
(audience applauding)

1:23:26.167 --> 1:23:27.961
- [Jamie] Go, Brie!

1:23:28.044 --> 1:23:29.754
- [Barb] Go, Millie!

1:23:29.838 --> 1:23:31.214
- You got this, Jody.

1:23:31.297 --> 1:23:32.215
- Yes, Jody!

1:23:39.180 --> 1:23:40.724
- Push through, Brie.

1:23:43.018 --> 1:23:43.727
- I'm trying.

1:23:46.271 --> 1:23:48.648
- Yeah, she just broke her arm.

1:23:49.691 --> 1:23:50.358
Oh.

1:23:51.693 --> 1:23:52.402
♪ Oh ♪

1:23:58.491 --> 1:24:00.493
- Oh my sweet jellybeans.

1:24:08.126 --> 1:24:09.002
- Oh my gosh.

1:24:09.085 --> 1:24:10.128
This would be so much easier

1:24:10.211 --> 1:24:11.755
with an electric mixer.

1:24:11.838 --> 1:24:14.048
- Brie, if you
need to stop, stop.

1:24:14.132 --> 1:24:14.883
It's okay.

1:24:14.966 --> 1:24:16.134
Don't hurt yourself.

1:24:16.217 --> 1:24:16.968
- I'm fine.

1:24:18.803 --> 1:24:20.388
- How much time is left?

1:24:20.472 --> 1:24:21.723
- Oh, right.

1:24:21.806 --> 1:24:22.807
20 minutes left, bakers.

1:24:22.891 --> 1:24:27.437
(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)

1:24:30.398 --> 1:24:33.318
(judges chattering)

1:24:37.822 --> 1:24:38.531
- Sugar!

1:24:39.491 --> 1:24:40.742
- You okay, Millie?

1:24:40.825 --> 1:24:42.827
- Yeah, I dropped
my blueberries.

1:24:42.911 --> 1:24:43.328
Luckily I have more.

1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:50.418
- Go, Millie bear!

1:24:50.502 --> 1:24:51.544
- Three minutes,
bakers. Three minutes.

1:25:11.898 --> 1:25:13.274
- Look at Jody.

1:25:13.358 --> 1:25:17.112
I mean, he is just like so
good at what he's doing.

1:25:19.072 --> 1:25:21.199
- One minute left, bakers.

1:25:22.909 --> 1:25:23.618
- I know!

1:25:27.705 --> 1:25:28.540
- Woo-hoo!

1:25:28.623 --> 1:25:29.791
You're almost there.

1:25:29.874 --> 1:25:31.376
Go, Millie bear, go!

1:26:06.244 --> 1:26:11.082
- Five, four, three, two, one.

1:26:11.165 --> 1:26:13.167
Time! Hands up, bakers.

1:26:13.251 --> 1:26:16.254
(audience applauding)

1:26:16.337 --> 1:26:17.589
(audience cheering)

1:26:17.672 --> 1:26:19.090
- Good job, Brie.

1:26:24.596 --> 1:26:26.139
- That's pretty close, guys.

1:26:26.222 --> 1:26:26.931
- Woo!

1:26:30.518 --> 1:26:33.146
(bright music)

1:26:43.656 --> 1:26:46.409
- They all look
really, really good.

1:26:46.492 --> 1:26:48.953
- Bakers, you will
now individually

1:26:49.037 --> 1:26:51.164
present your final bakes.

1:26:51.247 --> 1:26:52.540
Jody, we'll start with you.

1:26:56.252 --> 1:26:57.545
- For the final challenge

1:26:57.629 --> 1:27:02.508
I made a salted caramel
no bake cheesecake

1:27:02.592 --> 1:27:04.344
with graham cracker crust

1:27:04.427 --> 1:27:05.845
and a cream cheese filling.

1:27:06.763 --> 1:27:07.931
- Thank you, Jody.

1:27:08.014 --> 1:27:09.307
You may now go back
to your station.

1:27:09.390 --> 1:27:10.308
(audience applauding)

1:27:10.391 --> 1:27:11.392
Next, Brie.

1:27:17.649 --> 1:27:20.902
- I made a milk chocolate
no bake cheesecake

1:27:20.985 --> 1:27:22.820
with crushed Oreo crust,

1:27:22.904 --> 1:27:24.530
chocolate cream cheese filling,

1:27:24.614 --> 1:27:27.325
and caramel swirls with
whipped cream on top.

1:27:27.408 --> 1:27:28.993
- Mm, chocolate!

1:27:29.077 --> 1:27:30.244
(audience applauding)

1:27:30.328 --> 1:27:31.537
- Thank you, Brie.

1:27:31.621 --> 1:27:33.539
You may go back to your station.

1:27:33.623 --> 1:27:33.706
Next, Millie.

1:27:38.544 --> 1:27:39.504
- Hola.

1:27:39.587 --> 1:27:41.589
Today I made a vanilla
no bake cheesecake

1:27:41.673 --> 1:27:44.092
with vanilla lemon
cream cheese filling,

1:27:44.175 --> 1:27:46.344
topped with fresh
strawberries and blueberries.

1:27:46.427 --> 1:27:49.347
(audience applauding)

1:27:49.430 --> 1:27:51.015
- Thank you, Millie.

1:27:51.099 --> 1:27:52.892
And, lastly, Vanessa.

1:27:57.981 --> 1:28:00.233
- Today I made a strawberry
no bake cheesecake

1:28:00.316 --> 1:28:01.859
with a graham cracker crust

1:28:01.943 --> 1:28:04.028
filled with a fresh

1:28:04.112 --> 1:28:06.489
(audience applauding)

1:28:06.572 --> 1:28:07.490

1:28:07.573 --> 1:28:08.992
Please go back to your station.

(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)

1:28:20.461 --> 1:28:23.923
(soft suspenseful music)

1:28:33.391 --> 1:28:34.225
- I mean, come on, it's a cat.

1:28:34.308 --> 1:28:36.978
Who doesn't love a cat cake?

1:28:37.061 --> 1:28:38.354
- That was very cute, right?

1:28:38.438 --> 1:28:39.605
- Was that just whipped cream?

1:28:39.689 --> 1:28:41.274
- [Ms. Silvera] That
was a little lazy.

1:28:41.357 --> 1:28:42.442
I think I'm good.

1:28:45.069 --> 1:28:45.945
- All right.

1:28:47.113 --> 1:28:48.489
Oh my god.

1:28:48.573 --> 1:28:49.741
- Is it Oreo?

1:28:49.824 --> 1:28:52.493
Oreo is my favorite.
- Seriously good.

1:28:52.577 --> 1:28:53.286
Eat that.

1:28:53.369 --> 1:28:54.704
- I'm going to.

1:28:54.787 --> 1:28:56.372
- Oh my god.
- They put caramel

1:28:56.456 --> 1:28:56.789
on this one too.

1:28:59.125 --> 1:29:00.501
- She did this, didn't she?

1:29:03.504 --> 1:29:05.423
- Like OMG, right?
- That is the best

1:29:05.506 --> 1:29:07.425
dang cheesecake I've ever had.

1:29:07.508 --> 1:29:08.718
- [Ms. Henderson]
Pass me the cake.

1:29:08.801 --> 1:29:09.677
I mean the cat.

1:29:09.761 --> 1:29:11.929
Pass me the cat.
- Mm-mm-mm.

1:29:12.013 --> 1:29:12.638
Hold on, I need another
bite of this one.

1:29:23.608 --> 1:29:25.109
- It's not half bad.

1:29:26.444 --> 1:29:27.612
It's kinda good.

1:29:27.695 --> 1:29:29.405
- Does it look better
than it tastes though?

1:29:30.907 --> 1:29:31.949
- Probably, yeah.

1:29:33.367 --> 1:29:35.411
- You gotta be careful for that.

1:29:35.495 --> 1:29:37.497
- Is this the one
she screwed up?

1:29:37.580 --> 1:29:38.414
- I don't know.

1:29:38.498 --> 1:29:39.707
It just looks like a cat.

1:29:39.791 --> 1:29:41.709
- Hey, at least there's
some cheesecake.

1:29:41.793 --> 1:29:44.587
- [Ms. Silvera]
There's no sugar.

1:29:44.670 --> 1:29:45.963
- I actually like that.

1:29:46.047 --> 1:29:47.256
It's not as rich.

1:29:47.340 --> 1:29:48.549
- [Ms. Henderson] Exactly.

1:29:48.633 --> 1:29:49.634
- [Ms. Silvera] This is
like a diabetic cake.

1:29:49.717 --> 1:29:50.635
Like this is what
my grandma eats.

1:29:58.184 --> 1:29:59.435
- This one's very fruity.

1:29:59.519 --> 1:30:01.312
It's good, it's good.

1:30:04.065 --> 1:30:04.774
- This is Vanessa's.

1:30:07.360 --> 1:30:08.152
- I think I'm good guys.

1:30:08.236 --> 1:30:09.445
I've got mine up.

1:30:09.529 --> 1:30:10.196
- I just need to try
this one more time

1:30:10.279 --> 1:30:11.114
because it's plain.

1:30:11.197 --> 1:30:12.490
I need to cleanse my palette.

1:30:12.573 --> 1:30:13.491
- You go ahead.

1:30:17.620 --> 1:30:20.039
(bright music)

1:30:21.707 --> 1:30:23.709
(soft tense music)

1:30:23.793 --> 1:30:25.086
- Come on, Brie.

1:30:34.804 --> 1:30:35.555
- Are we ready?

1:30:35.638 --> 1:30:39.475

The winner of this

1:31:07.920 --> 1:31:09.005

1:31:16.637 --> 1:31:18.181
- Are you serious?

1:31:19.640 --> 1:31:22.226
- She doesn't even believe it.

1:31:24.979 --> 1:31:26.522
- [Jamie] Go Brie!

1:31:33.237 --> 1:31:34.071
- Go, Brie!

1:31:37.658 --> 1:31:39.243
- Go, baby! Go, baby!

1:31:40.661 --> 1:31:41.621
I knew it!

1:31:41.704 --> 1:31:42.705
I told you, I told you!

1:31:42.788 --> 1:31:43.456
(Jamie laughs)

1:31:43.539 --> 1:31:45.791
Let's go, let's go.

1:31:45.875 --> 1:31:45.958
Hey!

1:31:49.754 --> 1:31:50.796
- I am so proud of you.

1:31:52.423 --> 1:31:53.633
- That's our girl.

1:31:53.716 --> 1:31:54.717
- I'm pretty sure you can go get

1:31:54.800 --> 1:31:56.052
some chocolate cheesecake now.

1:31:56.135 --> 1:31:56.761
- Yes!

1:31:58.262 --> 1:31:59.138
- How's your arm feeling?

1:31:59.222 --> 1:32:00.431
- It's good.
- That's good.

1:32:00.514 --> 1:32:01.474
It doesn't hurt very much.
- Yeah?

1:32:01.557 --> 1:32:02.266
I am so proud of you.

1:32:02.350 --> 1:32:03.184
I knew you could do it.

1:32:03.267 --> 1:32:04.685
It was all those trials, Brie.

1:32:04.769 --> 1:32:05.603
I told you they were gonna work.

1:32:05.686 --> 1:32:07.438
- You did so good.

1:32:07.521 --> 1:32:10.566
You did so good,
I'm so proud of you.

1:32:12.151 --> 1:32:15.071
- My heart was beating
way above average.

1:32:15.154 --> 1:32:15.947
(Mr. Claymore chuckles)

1:32:16.030 --> 1:32:17.281
What a great Bake Off.

1:32:17.365 --> 1:32:18.074
- It was, it was.

1:32:19.909 --> 1:32:21.285
But how did I do?

1:32:21.369 --> 1:32:23.955
- Oh, you did a
fantastic job announcing.

1:32:24.038 --> 1:32:24.872
- Why, thank you.

1:32:24.956 --> 1:32:26.249
You did a great job judging.

1:32:26.332 --> 1:32:27.583
- Oh, thank you.

1:32:27.667 --> 1:32:28.376
- Oh, honey!

1:32:28.459 --> 1:32:30.127
I'm so proud of you.

1:32:30.211 --> 1:32:31.379
- Thank you, love.

1:32:31.462 --> 1:32:33.589
- Andrew, this is
my wife, Sophia.

1:32:33.673 --> 1:32:34.590
- Hi.

1:32:34.674 --> 1:32:35.841
- [Mr. Claymore]
Of course it is.

1:32:35.925 --> 1:32:37.802
- Oh, wait, Andrew.

1:32:37.885 --> 1:32:40.137
You gave Lester the
essential oils, right?

1:32:40.221 --> 1:32:42.765
I absolutely love them.

1:32:42.848 --> 1:32:44.558
- Yes, yes I did.

1:32:45.726 --> 1:32:46.769
Great meeting you.

1:32:47.645 --> 1:32:49.146
- Yeah, you too.
- Excuse me.

1:32:49.230 --> 1:32:50.898
(playful music)

1:32:53.859 --> 1:32:53.901
- It's okay.

1:32:55.820 --> 1:32:57.655
You're a strong independent man.

1:32:57.738 --> 1:32:58.781
(Mr. Claymore sighs)

1:32:58.864 --> 1:33:00.324
- Yes.

1:33:00.408 --> 1:33:02.660
Now I just need something
to fill my heart.

1:33:02.743 --> 1:33:03.828
- Cheesecake.

1:33:03.911 --> 1:33:06.831
(both laughing)

1:33:06.914 --> 1:33:09.208
And a glass of wine.
- Excuse me, guys.

1:33:09.292 --> 1:33:10.668
- Hey, Sophia.
- Hey.

1:33:10.751 --> 1:33:11.544
- It's so nice to see you again.

1:33:11.627 --> 1:33:12.586
- Oh, nice to see you too.

1:33:12.670 --> 1:33:13.671
- How are you?
- How's everything?

1:33:13.754 --> 1:33:15.006
- It's good. How's the business?

1:33:15.089 --> 1:33:17.133
- [Sophia] Oh, it's
fantastic. It's great.

1:33:17.216 --> 1:33:18.384
- [Ms. Henderson] Good, you
did such a good job today.

1:33:18.467 --> 1:33:19.802
- [Lester] I forgot you
two know each other.

1:33:19.885 --> 1:33:20.845
Thank you.

1:33:20.928 --> 1:33:22.263
- [Barb] You did
great, Millie bear.

1:33:22.346 --> 1:33:23.139
- Thanks, Mom.

1:33:23.222 --> 1:33:24.724
- [Barb] I'm so proud of you.

1:33:24.807 --> 1:33:25.641
How should we celebrate?

1:33:25.725 --> 1:33:28.477
- Hmm. Cheesecake.

1:33:28.561 --> 1:33:29.061
- Okay! Let's do it.

1:33:31.856 --> 1:33:35.401
- Son, we practiced
this 100 times.

1:33:35.484 --> 1:33:37.486
You must've measured the
vanilla extract wrong.

1:33:37.570 --> 1:33:38.529
- [Jody] Sorry, Dad.

1:33:38.612 --> 1:33:39.655
- Hon, don't be so hard on him.

1:33:39.739 --> 1:33:40.865
He did great.

1:33:40.948 --> 1:33:42.450
You did great, Jody.

1:33:42.533 --> 1:33:43.576
- [Jody] Thanks, Mom.

1:33:43.659 --> 1:33:45.036
- [Samantha] You did great.

1:33:46.287 --> 1:33:48.706
- Mom would've been
so proud of you.

1:33:48.789 --> 1:33:50.833
Your cheesecake looks amazing.

1:33:50.916 --> 1:33:52.418
- Thanks, Dad.

1:33:52.501 --> 1:33:55.087
(all chattering)

1:34:01.844 --> 1:34:03.054
(soft music)

1:34:03.137 --> 1:34:06.640
- Mm, smells like chocolate.
- Thank you.

1:34:06.724 --> 1:34:08.809
- [Student In Hat] Whoever
made this did a real good job.

1:34:08.893 --> 1:34:09.727
- Which one?

1:34:09.810 --> 1:34:11.103
- [Student In Hat] That one.

1:34:20.946 --> 1:34:22.073
- [Vanessa] Can I sit with you?

1:34:22.156 --> 1:34:24.992
- No, but you
probably will anyway.

1:34:28.871 --> 1:34:31.791
- I'm sorry for everything
I did to you, Brie.

1:34:31.874 --> 1:34:33.793
- You think a sorry
will unbreak my arm?

1:34:33.876 --> 1:34:34.877
- No.

1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:36.212
I never meant that to happen.

1:34:36.295 --> 1:34:38.089
- You never even said
sorry when it did happen.

1:34:38.172 --> 1:34:41.300
- [Vanessa] Because I didn't
think you wanted to talk to me.

1:34:41.384 --> 1:34:44.136
- Well, I just
wanted to tell you

1:34:44.220 --> 1:34:45.805
that I never meant
to not be there

1:34:45.888 --> 1:34:46.806
when your mom died.

1:34:46.889 --> 1:34:48.641
- Yeah, I know.

1:34:48.724 --> 1:34:49.850
- Do you really?

1:34:49.934 --> 1:34:50.643
- [Vanessa] Yeah.

1:34:51.936 --> 1:34:53.771
I was just mean to you
when we were younger

1:34:53.854 --> 1:34:55.606
so you wouldn't
come over anymore.

1:34:55.689 --> 1:34:56.399
- Why?

1:34:58.150 --> 1:35:01.404
- Because my mom
loved having you over

1:35:01.487 --> 1:35:03.739
and you got all the attention
when you were there.

1:35:03.823 --> 1:35:05.408
So I started being mean to you

1:35:06.367 --> 1:35:07.910
so that we wouldn't be friends

1:35:07.993 --> 1:35:10.121
and then, well, you know.

1:35:10.204 --> 1:35:14.959
- Well, I'm sorry
for everything too.

1:35:15.042 --> 1:35:15.084
- [Vanessa] I know.

1:35:19.088 --> 1:35:21.424
- Vanessa, can I talk
to you for a sec?

1:35:21.507 --> 1:35:22.550
- Uh, yeah.

1:35:24.969 --> 1:35:26.429
Sorry I lied to
you about my dad.

1:35:26.512 --> 1:35:28.347
He's not really a doctor.

1:35:28.431 --> 1:35:29.598
- Oh, no.

1:35:29.682 --> 1:35:30.516
I wanted to see
if you would like

1:35:30.599 --> 1:35:31.809
to eat dinner with me tonight.

1:35:31.892 --> 1:35:32.852
- Really?

1:35:32.935 --> 1:35:35.813
- Yeah, I mean, my
parents would be there

1:35:35.896 --> 1:35:37.314
but they can sit
at another table.

1:35:37.398 --> 1:35:38.691
- That's awesome.

1:35:38.774 --> 1:35:40.568
Do you think my
dad could come too?

1:35:40.651 --> 1:35:42.153
He needs more
company these days.

1:35:42.236 --> 1:35:44.196
- [Jody] Yeah, of course.

1:35:44.280 --> 1:35:45.948
- You wanna go inside now, Brie?

1:35:46.949 --> 1:35:47.867
- I'll wait for my dad.

1:35:47.950 --> 1:35:48.993
You guys go ahead.

1:35:49.076 --> 1:35:50.578
- [Vanessa] Okay,
see you in there.

1:35:53.664 --> 1:35:55.332
- Don't tell me any
bad news, Grant.

1:35:57.626 --> 1:35:58.335
Mm-hmm.

1:36:00.546 --> 1:36:01.255
Yeah.

1:36:03.215 --> 1:36:03.257
You didn't?

1:36:05.718 --> 1:36:06.427
Yes!

1:36:07.344 --> 1:36:08.095
Thank you! Finally!

1:36:10.848 --> 1:36:11.515
All right.

1:36:12.808 --> 1:36:14.268
Okay, I'll call you tomorrow.

1:36:14.351 --> 1:36:16.353
Bye. (laughs)

1:36:18.481 --> 1:36:19.523
Looks like you're
not the only one

1:36:19.607 --> 1:36:20.858
getting a big fat check.

1:36:20.941 --> 1:36:22.568
They tripled my advance,

1:36:22.651 --> 1:36:24.195
more stores want my book.

1:36:24.278 --> 1:36:25.070

1:36:25.154 --> 1:36:25.863

- That's amazing, Dad.

1:36:31.994 --> 1:36:33.120
Make sure to go tell Mom.

1:36:33.204 --> 1:36:34.371
She'll be super happy

1:36:34.455 --> 1:36:35.289
that you don't
have to take money

1:36:35.372 --> 1:36:36.665
out of your savings anymore.

1:36:37.875 --> 1:36:38.584
- Savings?

1:36:39.627 --> 1:36:40.878
You know about that?

1:36:40.961 --> 1:36:41.212
- Uh, no, no.

1:36:43.672 --> 1:36:44.924
- Well, it doesn't matter

1:36:45.007 --> 1:36:46.258

1:36:49.136 --> 1:36:50.596
- Oh, Dad.
- Yes?

1:36:50.679 --> 1:36:52.139
- [Brie] Is $5,000 enough
for culinary school?

1:36:52.223 --> 1:36:53.849
- Not even close.

1:36:53.933 --> 1:36:56.101
