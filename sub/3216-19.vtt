But I will call you back. I will call you.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.824
-I'll see you later.
-Wait, so you're not leaving tonight?

17:13.825 --> 17:16.745
No, I guess not. I'll see you.

17:18.580 --> 17:20.957
Okay.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.837
I don't understand, Dean.
We burned the damn thing.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.631
Yeah, thank you, Captain Obvious.

17:28.715 --> 17:32.635
All right, we just need to figure out
another way to get rid of it. Any ideas?

17:32.719 --> 17:36.264
Okay, all right. Well, um, in almost
all the lore about haunted paintings...

17:36.431 --> 17:38.266
...it's always the painting's subject
that haunts them.

17:38.475 --> 17:41.561
Yeah? We need to figure out
everything there is to know...

17:41.644 --> 17:45.190
...about that creepy-ass family
in that creepy-ass painting.

17:45.273 --> 17:47.233
What were their names again?

17:48.234 --> 17:51.321
-You said the Isaiah Merchant family?
-Yeah, that's right.

17:51.529 --> 17:54.741
I dug up every scrap of local history
I could find.

17:54.908 --> 17:58.453
-So, uh, are you boys crime buffs?
-Kind of.

17:58.661 --> 18:01.039
-Yeah. Why do you ask?
-Well....

18:04.834 --> 18:08.338
-Yes. Yeah, that sounds about right.
-The whole family was killed?

18:08.546 --> 18:11.049
It seems this Isaiah,
he slits his kids' throats...

18:11.257 --> 18:13.426
...then his wife, then himself.

18:13.635 --> 18:17.430
Now, he was a barber by trade.
Used a straight razor.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.850
-Why did he do it?
-Well, let's look.

18:21.059 --> 18:24.979
"People who knew him described Isaiah
as having stern and harsh temperament.

18:25.146 --> 18:29.692
Controlled his family with an iron fist.
Wife, two sons, adopted daughter."

18:29.901 --> 18:31.152
Uh.... Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

18:31.402 --> 18:34.656
There were whispers that the wife
was gonna take the kids and leave--

18:34.739 --> 18:37.075
Uh, which, of course, you know,
in that day and age....

18:37.158 --> 18:41.913
Um, so instead, old man Isaiah,
well, he gave them all a shave.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.790
(LAUGHING)

18:44.916 --> 18:48.711
-Say what happened to the bodies?
-Just that they were all cremated.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.465
-Anything else?
MAN: Yeah.

18:52.632 --> 18:57.053
Actually, I found a picture of the family.
It's right here, somewhere.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.681
Right. Here it is.

19:07.647 --> 19:11.734
-Could we get a copy of this, please?
-Hmm. Sure.

19:15.864 --> 19:19.868
Dad, you promised you wouldn't
sell that painting.

19:20.076 --> 19:23.663
I know, sweetie, but Evelyn's offered
a persuasive amount of money.

19:24.706 --> 19:27.333
You're shameless, you know that?

19:27.542 --> 19:30.587
For that kind of money,
I can afford to be.

19:34.549 --> 19:36.509
SAM:
I'm telling you, man, I'm sure of it.

19:36.718 --> 19:38.928
Painting at the auction house,
Dad is looking down.

19:39.137 --> 19:42.432
Painting here, Dad's looking out.
The painting has changed, Dean.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.435
You think Daddy Dearest
is in the painting and handing out...

19:45.643 --> 19:47.228
...Columbian neckties
like with his family?

19:47.437 --> 19:48.771
Yeah, it seems like it.

19:48.980 --> 19:52.066
But if his bones are already dusted,
how are we gonna stop him?

19:52.233 --> 19:56.237
If Isaiah's position changed, then maybe
other things in the painting changed.

19:56.446 --> 20:00.283
-You know, it could give us some clues.
-What, like a Da Vinci Code deal?

20:00.491 --> 20:03.453
I don't know. I'm just still waiting
for the movie on that one.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.830
Anyway, we gotta get back in
and see that painting.

20:06.039 --> 20:09.334
Which is good. You can get
more time to crush on your girlfriend.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.628
-Dude, enough already.
-What?

20:11.836 --> 20:15.340
What? Ever since we got here, you've
been trying to pimp me out to Sarah.

20:15.506 --> 20:18.301
-Just back off, all right?
-Well, you like her, don't you?

20:18.468 --> 20:20.929
You like her, she likes you,
you're consenting adults.

20:21.137 --> 20:22.430
What's the point, Dean?

20:22.639 --> 20:25.683
-We'll just leave. We always leave.
-I'm not talking about marriage.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.269
I don't get it. What do you care
if I hook up?

20:28.478 --> 20:31.105
Because then maybe you wouldn't
be so cranky all the time.

20:31.648 --> 20:32.732
(SCOFFS)

20:34.484 --> 20:37.445
You know, seriously, Sam,
this isn't about just hooking up, okay?

20:37.654 --> 20:40.823
I mean, I think that this Sarah girl
could be good for you.

20:44.327 --> 20:48.665
And I don't mean any disrespect, but
I'm sure that this is about Jessica, right?

20:49.874 --> 20:53.836
Now, I don't know what it's like
to lose somebody like that...

20:54.045 --> 20:58.341
...but I would think that she would
want you to be happy.

21:00.635 --> 21:04.847
God forbid, have fun once in a while.
Wouldn't she?

21:09.644 --> 21:11.312
Yeah, I know she would.

21:16.651 --> 21:20.446
Yeah, you're right, part of this
is about Jessica.

21:21.739 --> 21:25.034
-But not the main part.
-What's it about?

21:29.872 --> 21:31.666
Yeah, all right.

21:33.167 --> 21:38.089
We still gotta see that painting, which
means you still gotta call Sarah, so....

21:46.097 --> 21:47.390
(CLEARS THROAT)

21:49.976 --> 21:53.354
Sarah, hey, it's Sam. Hey. Hi.

21:53.563 --> 21:56.315
Good. Good, yeah.
Um, what about you?

21:56.524 --> 21:58.443
-Yeah, good. Good, really good.
-Smooth.

21:59.444 --> 22:02.947
So, uh.... So listen, me and my brother
were, uh, thinking...

22:03.156 --> 22:06.492
...that maybe we'd like to come back
in and look at the painting again.

22:06.701 --> 22:09.537
I think maybe we are
interested in buying it.

22:09.746 --> 22:13.708
Wait. What? Who'd you sell it to?

22:13.916 --> 22:16.252
Sarah, I need an address right now.

22:51.913 --> 22:53.581
(RUSTLING)

23:03.633 --> 23:06.928
-Sam, what's happening?
SAM: I told you you shouldn't have come.

23:09.347 --> 23:10.389
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

23:10.556 --> 23:12.975
-Hello. Anybody home?
-You said Evelyn might be in danger.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.436
-What kind of danger?
DEAN: I can't knock this down.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.105
I gotta pick it.

23:18.689 --> 23:20.983
What are you guys, burglars?

23:21.192 --> 23:23.778
SAM: I wish it's that simple.
You should wait in the car.

23:23.986 --> 23:27.365
-It's for your own good.
-The hell I will. Evelyn's a friend.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.910
-Evelyn?
SAM: Evelyn.

23:34.997 --> 23:36.791
SARAH:
Evelyn?

23:46.968 --> 23:51.556
Evelyn? It's Sarah Blake.

23:51.722 --> 23:53.558
-Are you all right?
DEAN: Sarah, don't. Sarah.

23:54.016 --> 23:56.394
(SCREAMING)

23:59.105 --> 24:01.107
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

24:01.315 --> 24:02.316
(SARAH GASPING)

24:02.942 --> 24:04.569
Oh, my God.

24:09.323 --> 24:10.950
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

24:12.410 --> 24:14.579
Hey. You all right?

24:14.787 --> 24:18.374
No, actually. I just lied to the cops
and told them I went to Evelyn's...

24:18.583 --> 24:21.085
...alone and found her like that.

24:22.336 --> 24:24.714
-Thank you.
-Don't. I'm about to call them...

24:24.881 --> 24:28.634
...if you don't tell me what the hell's
going on. Who's killing these people?

24:32.597 --> 24:34.807
-"What."
-What?

24:35.016 --> 24:38.895
It's not "who."
It's "what" is killing those people?

24:41.981 --> 24:44.775
Sarah, you saw that painting move.

24:45.860 --> 24:50.031
No. No, I was-- I was seeing things.

24:50.239 --> 24:52.992
-It's impossible.
-Yeah, well, welcome to our world.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.995
SAM:
Sarah, I know this sounds crazy...

24:56.871 --> 24:59.373
...but we think that
that painting is haunted.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.171
You're joking.

25:08.925 --> 25:11.135
You're not joking.

25:12.261 --> 25:15.514
-God. The guys I go out with.
-Sarah, think about it.

25:15.681 --> 25:18.976
Evelyn, the Telescas,
they both had the painting.

25:19.185 --> 25:22.230
And there have been others.
Wherever this thing goes, people die.

25:22.396 --> 25:24.565
And we're just trying to stop it.

25:24.774 --> 25:26.776
And that's the truth.

25:28.194 --> 25:32.031
Well, then I guess you better
show me. I'm coming with you.

25:32.114 --> 25:36.202
What? No. Sarah, no.
You should just go home.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.704
This stuff can get dangerous and....

25:41.415 --> 25:43.292
And I don't want you to get hurt.

25:43.501 --> 25:45.920
Look, you guys are probably crazy,
but if you're right?

25:46.128 --> 25:49.882
Well, me and my dad sold that painting.
We might've got these people killed.

25:49.966 --> 25:52.551
I'm not saying I'm not scared,
because I am scared...

25:52.635 --> 25:55.846
...but I'm not gonna
run and hide either.

25:58.099 --> 26:00.559
So are we going or what?

26:00.768 --> 26:02.019
Sam.

26:03.312 --> 26:04.563
Marry that girl.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.987
Uh, isn't this a crime scene?

26:11.195 --> 26:14.615
Well, you already lied to the cops.
What's another infraction?

26:33.884 --> 26:36.595
Aren't you worried that
it's gonna, you know, kill us?

26:36.762 --> 26:41.392
No. It seems to do its thing at night.
I think we're all right in the daylight.

26:45.187 --> 26:47.315
Sam, check it out.

26:47.481 --> 26:49.900
The razor, it's, uh-- It's closed.
But it's open in that one.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.111
SARAH: What?
-If the spirit's changing aspects...

26:52.278 --> 26:55.031
...of the painting,
maybe it's doing so for a reason.

26:56.157 --> 26:59.910
Hey, hey. Look at this.
The painting in the painting.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.834
Looks like a crypt
or a mausoleum or something.

27:07.001 --> 27:07.877
Hmm.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.180
"Merchant."

27:19.388 --> 27:21.724
(CAWING)

27:27.980 --> 27:30.483
This is the third boneyard
we've checked.

27:30.691 --> 27:33.110
I think this ghost is jerking us around.

27:34.153 --> 27:37.531
So this is what you guys do
for a living?

27:37.740 --> 27:41.994
Not exactly. We don't get paid.

27:42.078 --> 27:44.580
Well, mazel tov.

27:46.874 --> 27:48.417
DEAN:
Over there.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.768
(DEAN COUGHING)

28:23.119 --> 28:26.372
Okay. That, right there,
is the creepiest thing I've ever seen.

28:26.580 --> 28:29.959
It was, uh, sort of a tradition
at the time.

28:30.042 --> 28:33.087
Whenever a child died,
sometimes they'd preserve the kid's...

28:33.170 --> 28:37.550
...favorite toy in a glass case.
Put it next to the headstone or crypt.

28:42.555 --> 28:45.224
-You notice anything strange here?
-Uh, where do I start?

28:45.433 --> 28:47.893
No, that's not what I mean.
Look at the urns.

28:50.980 --> 28:54.358
-Yeah, there are only four.
DEAN: Yeah, mom and the three kids.

28:54.567 --> 28:56.861
Daddy Dearest isn't here.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.947
So where is he?

29:00.990 --> 29:02.992
SARAH:
So, what is your brother doing in there?

29:03.075 --> 29:07.037
Searching county death certificates.
To learn what happened to Isaiah's body.

29:07.121 --> 29:09.540
How'd he even get in the door?

29:09.623 --> 29:12.918
Lying and subterfuge, mostly.

29:15.171 --> 29:16.547
You have a, um....

29:16.755 --> 29:18.632
You have an eyelash on your....

29:18.841 --> 29:21.010
Your right-- No. Uh, you know what?

29:21.302 --> 29:22.595
(BOTH LAUGH)

29:22.845 --> 29:23.971
-Do you mind if I--?
-No.

29:24.180 --> 29:25.973
Okay.

29:26.515 --> 29:28.017
Okay, I got it.

29:28.726 --> 29:30.394
Make a wish.

29:37.526 --> 29:39.612
-Sam, can I ask you something?
-Yeah, sure.

29:39.862 --> 29:45.034
I don't mean to be forward,
but a girl could wait here forever.

29:46.327 --> 29:50.956
Is there something here
between us? Or am I delusional?

29:51.165 --> 29:53.375
You're not delusional.

29:53.584 --> 29:55.920
But there's a "but" coming.

29:56.128 --> 30:00.966
But I don't think this
would be a good idea.

30:03.177 --> 30:05.346
Can I ask why?

30:06.597 --> 30:08.557
Because I like you.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.937
Wait. You lost me.

30:14.522 --> 30:16.774
Look, it's hard to explain.

30:17.566 --> 30:21.195
It's just that when
people are around me....

30:21.862 --> 30:23.822
I don't know, they get hurt.

30:24.031 --> 30:26.992
-What do you mean?
-I mean, like, physically hurt.

30:28.035 --> 30:30.913
With what my brother and I do, it's....

30:35.960 --> 30:37.503
Sarah...

30:39.964 --> 30:41.507
...I had a girlfriend.

30:43.884 --> 30:48.889
And she died. And my mom died too.

30:49.765 --> 30:51.850
I don't know, it's like....

30:53.310 --> 30:56.188
It's like I'm cursed or something.

30:56.397 --> 30:59.024
Like death just follows me around.

30:59.108 --> 31:02.486
I'm not scared of much. But if I
let myself have feelings for anybody--

31:02.570 --> 31:04.989
SARAH:
You're scared they'd get hurt too.

31:07.741 --> 31:11.912
-That's very sweet. And very archaic.
-Sorry?

31:11.996 --> 31:14.290
Look. I'm a big girl, Sam.
It's not your job...

31:14.373 --> 31:18.002
...to make decisions for me. There's
always a chance of getting hurt.

31:18.085 --> 31:21.088
I'm not talking about a broken
heart and a tub of Häagen-Dazs.

31:21.171 --> 31:24.091
-I'm talking life and death.
-Tomorrow I could get hit by a bus.

31:24.174 --> 31:26.385
That's what life is.

31:26.594 --> 31:29.722
Look. I know losing somebody
you love, it's terrible.

31:29.930 --> 31:33.559
You shut yourself off.
Believe me, I know.

31:35.019 --> 31:38.606
But when you shut out pain,
you shut out everything else too.

31:38.856 --> 31:42.276
Sarah, you don't understand.
The pain that I went through...

31:43.777 --> 31:47.364
...I can't go through it again. I can't.

31:51.869 --> 31:53.370
Am I interrupting something?

31:53.579 --> 31:54.913
-No.
-Not at all.

31:54.997 --> 31:57.499
-Huh. Apparently.
-So, what did you get?

31:57.583 --> 32:00.878
Pay dirt. The surviving
relatives of the Merchant family...

32:01.086 --> 32:04.715
...were so ashamed of Isaiah, they didn't
want him interred with the family.

32:04.882 --> 32:08.010
They handed him over to the county.
County gave him a pauper's funeral.

32:08.260 --> 32:12.139
Economy style. Turns out he wasn't
cremated, he was buried in a pine box.

32:12.348 --> 32:14.600
-So there are bones to burn.
-There are bones to burn.

32:14.892 --> 32:16.935
Tell me you know where.

32:24.026 --> 32:27.363
(SAM AND DEAN
GRUNTING AND PANTING)

32:30.574 --> 32:33.869
You guys seem to be
uncomfortably comfortable with this.

32:34.745 --> 32:38.290
Well, this isn't exactly
the first grave we've dug.

32:39.792 --> 32:41.919
Still think I'm a catch?

was harmless now.

Better safe than sorry.
We're gonna bury the sucker.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.936
-Yeah.
-Hey. Hey, hey.

supposed to look like that?

Girl? What girl?

34:58.222 --> 35:00.474
She's out of the painting.
Might've been her all along.

DEAN (ON PHONE):
Wasn't the dad looking at her?

35:03.018 --> 35:05.729
-Maybe he was warning us.
-Let's recap later, all right? Get us out.

Get salt or iron.

Come on.

Low-sodium freaks. Find any iron?

-Iron repels evil.

35:24.832 --> 35:26.917

the dolls in the kids' image.

would use the kids' real hair.

might have the girl's hair.
