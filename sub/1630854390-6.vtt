00:01.376 --> 00:05.214
<i>Full lockdown, now. No one gets in or out.</i>

00:05.214 --> 00:06.507
Hello, everyone.

00:06.507 --> 00:10.427
I am so sorry
for this temporary disruption.

00:10.427 --> 00:12.804
<i>The people behind this
will be apprehended.</i>

00:12.804 --> 00:14.473
Where's the fucking exit?

00:16.558 --> 00:19.937
And I can assure you
that your loved ones are in no danger.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.188
Thank you for your patience.

00:24.608 --> 00:27.694
Get the Bautistas taken somewhere private
right away. You understand?

00:27.694 --> 00:28.779
Do it. Go.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.874
Here you go, sir.
And take a deep breath of this.

00:42.251 --> 00:43.252
What the fuck's going on?

00:43.252 --> 00:45.754
I've still got these people's fucking kids
all over the fucking screen.

00:46.338 --> 00:48.131
<i>The investors are shitting their pants.</i>

00:48.131 --> 00:49.925
<i>We're covering every floor.</i>

00:51.927 --> 00:54.304
Get to the A/V room
and pull the fucking plug.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.814
We are at the A/V room.

01:13.657 --> 01:14.658
Clear.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.222
You sure?

01:40.559 --> 01:41.560
Yeah?

02:00.495 --> 02:01.747
<i>Mr. Albrecht.</i>

02:03.040 --> 02:05.417
What is it?
-<i>The A/V tech saw two guys.</i>

02:06.043 --> 02:07.085
Bring him down.

02:08.419 --> 02:11.924
I am so sorry. Is your dad okay?
-You told me things were iron tight.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.258
And they were.

02:13.258 --> 02:16.637
Do we know who did this?
Now we're all being held hostage?

02:17.763 --> 02:19.890
Carter, you know about my family.

02:19.890 --> 02:24.478
Whatever kind of shit show this is,
my dad and I can't be around for it.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.815
Or my dad and I will have to deal with it.
And be seen to deal with it.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.776
Do you understand?
-Absolutely.

02:30.776 --> 02:33.862
You find who did this discreetly
and legally, and you bring them to me.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.113
I am on it.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.951
And for God's sakes, get the guests
some champagne or something.

02:38.951 --> 02:42.371
You've got a room full of investors
standing around like fucking refugees.

02:42.371 --> 02:43.914
Absolutely, thank you so much.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.416
Everyone.

02:46.416 --> 02:52.714
Thank you. Thank you so much
for your time and your understanding.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.092
Why don't you take a seat, gentlemen?

02:55.092 --> 02:57.803
On behalf of myself and everyone at Virid,

02:57.803 --> 03:00.848
I'd like to offer
our most sincere apologies.

03:01.348 --> 03:05.227
The good news is we have a witness
who can identify the perpetrators,

03:05.227 --> 03:08.021
so just bear with us
for a few more moments.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.858
Enjoy your champagne and canapÃ©s,

03:10.858 --> 03:13.151
and we'll just get this train
right back on the track.

03:13.151 --> 03:17.823
Okay, we just need you to stay tight,
for your own safety.

03:20.242 --> 03:22.202
There was security all over the place.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.620
Do you recognize anyone here?

03:23.620 --> 03:26.540
Saving that boy's life's gonna be
the death of you and me both.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.542
It's all right. You're doing great.

03:28.542 --> 03:32.004
What about here? Do one of these people--
these look familiar?

03:32.004 --> 03:33.422
No.
-You're doing great. No?

03:33.422 --> 03:35.883
You sure? All right. Come on.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.719
Right, tell me about these two.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.430
Anyone here? Him? You recognize him?
-No.

03:41.430 --> 03:42.848
No? All right.

03:42.848 --> 03:45.058
They seem to know you.
-No.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.769
No? Sorry, sir. Thank you so much.

03:47.769 --> 03:52.232
No, not really familiar with anyone
at this table, so why don't we-- Here.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.902
All right. Hello.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.863
Okay, what about this man?

03:59.281 --> 04:00.282
Do you recognize him?

04:02.659 --> 04:04.119
Luis, do you recognize this man?

05:19.486 --> 05:22.197
Luis, do you recognize him?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.909
No, sir. Sorry, no.
-Okay. This gentleman?

05:30.622 --> 05:32.291
No, sir. Sorry, I don't know them.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.294
Okay. Sorry, gentlemen.
Thank you for your cooperation.

05:35.294 --> 05:37.838
Please enjoy your champagne, all right?
Good night.

06:46.323 --> 06:47.324
Gross.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.676
What are you doing?
-Nothing.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.471
What are you doing?
Why are you up so early?

07:10.764 --> 07:11.765
Couldn't sleep.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.268
What about you?

07:14.268 --> 07:16.645
Found another scorpion
in my shoe this morning.

07:21.191 --> 07:25.237
I need to tell you something.
I found some stuff out.

07:26.238 --> 07:27.239
Yeah, like what?

07:29.491 --> 07:32.077
Like, about back in the day.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.373
Mom lied to us.

07:37.666 --> 07:38.750
What do you mean?

07:39.585 --> 07:41.295
Like, Dad isn't the reason we're running.

07:43.213 --> 07:46.008
I thought it was Dad that destroyed
the government files and then--

07:46.008 --> 07:48.385
Yeah, but that's not it.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.389
Mom is the one who did something.

07:53.015 --> 07:54.600
She's the reason we're running.

07:55.976 --> 08:01.857
I guess when Mom and Dad were separated,
she and this guy...

08:02.441 --> 08:03.442
Richard?

08:04.776 --> 08:07.946
Yeah, they were involved
in some pretty shady stuff.

08:08.697 --> 08:09.823
Shady how?

08:10.866 --> 08:13.410
Like, burning places down.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.494
Jesus.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.414
So Mom and this guy, they--
-Richard.

08:18.415 --> 08:19.416
Uh-huh.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.544
They blew this place up.

08:23.837 --> 08:27.007
They planted a bomb in the lab,

08:27.007 --> 08:29.885
and it was supposed to be empty
and everything,

08:29.885 --> 08:33.138
but this woman was there and...

08:36.058 --> 08:38.268
She-- Yeah.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.605
"Yeah"? What?

08:42.188 --> 08:43.106
She died.

08:49.696 --> 08:53.617
Okay, but, like, Mom didn't mean to.
It was an accident.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.955
Yeah, but she died.

08:58.914 --> 09:02.042
Mom still killed someone.
It doesn't matter if it was on accident.

09:02.709 --> 09:06.547
What? I mean, it doesn't mean
she doesn't feel bad about it.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.049
You're mad 'cause she died?

09:09.633 --> 09:11.635
No, I'm mad that they lied to us.

09:11.635 --> 09:13.554
No. No, it was Richard.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.722
He would have made her do it, okay?

09:15.722 --> 09:17.641
Mom wouldn't do something like that.

09:17.641 --> 09:20.394
I mean,
she probably still hates him for it.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.604
They were talking,
and I heard her say, like,

09:22.604 --> 09:23.939
"Get the hell away from me."

09:24.648 --> 09:27.985
I could totally see that asshole trying
to convince her to do something like that.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.196
We have to do something.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.700
What do you mean? I don't get it.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.786
I mean we have to do something
to keep him away from us.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.956
He's the problem.
-Charlie, this is about Mom and Dad.

09:40.956 --> 09:44.251
No, it's not! I don't wanna blame them.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.337
But how can you not feel lied to?

09:48.380 --> 09:51.425
Mom let Dad take the blame for everything.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.969
Our whole lives have been built on lies--
-You blame them for everything!

09:55.262 --> 09:58.682
Okay? This isn't about them.
This is about Richard.

09:58.682 --> 10:01.226
Don't make it about us. There's--

10:01.226 --> 10:04.438
Charlie, that's not what I'm t--
-Why are you telling me this?

10:04.438 --> 10:06.315
Why are you trying to make me feel bad?

10:07.608 --> 10:08.901
Do you hate me now too?

10:11.486 --> 10:12.487
No.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.115
Never mind.

10:33.175 --> 10:34.968
You be careful getting home now.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.938
Hey, call me sometime.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.408
<i>Thanks for seeing me, Renee.</i>

10:58.408 --> 11:00.744
I appreciate it. I know how busy you are.

11:02.913 --> 11:05.332
So, the thing is, a crazy thing,

11:05.332 --> 11:09.545
Allie Fox's wife reached out to me.
Margot.

11:10.045 --> 11:13.257
I mean, she offered to turn Allie over
to us in exchange for immunity.

11:15.717 --> 11:18.554
We're joking here, right?
-Just do me a favor.

11:18.554 --> 11:19.680
What-- Now you want a favor?

11:20.556 --> 11:23.183
You were told to mothball
that Allie-Margot Fox shit years ago.

11:23.183 --> 11:27.729
And instead, you unlawfully deployed
two agents to Mexico and get them killed.

11:27.729 --> 11:30.607
And so, I am stuck lying through my teeth
to my superiors.

11:31.191 --> 11:34.820
That's the favor, JJ. You're not in jail.
-I get it. I do.

11:34.820 --> 11:37.739
I appreciate it very much too.
I mean, that's why I turned her down.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.032
Good. Good. Okay.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.827
Okay, you've made consistently bad
judgment calls that cannot be undone.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.996
You did the right thing. Okay? Gold star.

11:45.581 --> 11:46.582
So...

11:46.582 --> 11:49.293
So, my buddy at the DIA,
he flagged something.

11:49.293 --> 11:53.964
Some targeted disruption
at a Virid PLC event in Guatemala City.

11:53.964 --> 11:56.675
And he reviews everything
that they've got.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.552
Right off the bat, he gets a voice match.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.512
He pings this to me this morning.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.891
<i>Your new boss needs me
for something, right?</i>

12:04.516 --> 12:07.561
<i>Or I got that vibe, didn't you?
'Cause I definitely got that vibe.</i>

12:10.689 --> 12:11.690
That's Allie Fox.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.235
I don't give a shit.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.032
Well, Renee, maybe you should.

12:21.617 --> 12:22.701
I don't give a shit.

12:22.701 --> 12:26.496
A tape threatening hostage-taking
was played at this very same event,

12:27.372 --> 12:29.666
narrated by none other
than Richard Beaumont.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.794
Beaumont and Allie are working together.

12:33.504 --> 12:36.131
And Margot Fox is involved
in some crazy way.

12:36.131 --> 12:37.341
Shit, I don't even know.

12:38.217 --> 12:41.261
I mean, but hail, hail,
the gang is all back together, right?

12:43.514 --> 12:44.765
That was no clown show.

12:45.516 --> 12:48.060
That was a well-planned attempt
to scare off investors.

12:48.769 --> 12:51.647
I mean, Renee, you got
major-league players involved here.

12:51.647 --> 12:53.815
You've got corporate,
you've got individual,

12:53.815 --> 12:56.360
you've got host government involvement.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.445
Shit, I don't know, throw in some cartel.

13:00.030 --> 13:03.367
But Renee, I'm telling you right now,
it is just their opening salvo.

13:04.451 --> 13:08.288
You can bet something bigger is coming,
something big and something noisy.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.211
Renee, people are gonna die.

15:41.358 --> 15:42.359
Shit.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.160
Charlie.

16:36.371 --> 16:37.706
That's so nasty.

16:38.457 --> 16:39.583
You're kidding!

16:40.459 --> 16:42.628
This is the best part!

16:42.628 --> 16:43.670
No...

16:43.670 --> 16:46.673
Seriously!
Just wait. You're gonna love it.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.175
Okay.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.929
How long does this need to cook?

16:53.180 --> 16:58.227
We wrap it in banana leaves,
and put it in the hole for...

16:59.019 --> 17:01.063
six or eight hours.

17:03.482 --> 17:04.398
Delicious!

17:04.398 --> 17:06.026
No, you can have it.

19:06.522 --> 19:07.940
Who the hell are you?

19:13.028 --> 19:14.905
I know you're angry that I'm here, but--

19:14.905 --> 19:16.156
Sit down.

19:17.699 --> 19:18.700
Sit the fuck down.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.540
My mom told you to stay away.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.125
Are you gonna do that?

19:28.168 --> 19:29.795
You gonna leave my family alone?

19:31.046 --> 19:32.673
'Cause it's your fault
that we're on the run!

19:34.466 --> 19:37.511
I knew you when you were a little kid.

19:38.595 --> 19:40.722
So?
-You were such a gentle child.

19:42.516 --> 19:44.935
What? You think I can't do this?
-I know you could.

19:45.519 --> 19:46.728
We all could.

19:46.728 --> 19:49.565
It's easy to hurt someone,
especially when you're angry and afraid.

19:50.607 --> 19:51.650
But did you know

19:52.317 --> 19:56.196
that the human brain is
coded for compassion, Charlie?

19:57.239 --> 19:58.240
Yeah.

19:59.700 --> 20:00.909
It's in all of us.

20:02.828 --> 20:04.454
We dehumanize our enemies

20:04.454 --> 20:06.832
not because we're bad people,
but because we're good.

20:08.876 --> 20:15.132
We put hoods on the faces
of people that we're about to execute...

20:17.676 --> 20:18.677
because--

20:21.430 --> 20:24.016
because we don't want to look
in their eyes before they die.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.855
I think it's hard
to come back from something like--

20:29.855 --> 20:32.441
No! Get the fuck away from me! Shut up!
-All right, all right.

20:32.441 --> 20:34.318
I'm not scared, asshole.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.361
I've already done this.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.995
Look, come on, Charlie. Charlie.

20:50.292 --> 20:51.627
Fuck it.

21:08.393 --> 21:10.270
Stay away from us.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.157
Bastard.

22:54.666 --> 22:56.126
No.

22:56.752 --> 22:57.753
Charlie.

22:57.753 --> 22:59.087
No way. Come on.

23:07.054 --> 23:08.055
Charlie...

23:43.632 --> 23:44.925
Are you going to the party?

23:47.094 --> 23:49.596
No, I think I'll wait here for your dad.

23:52.516 --> 23:53.600
Cooked a goat.

23:55.769 --> 23:56.770
A goat?

24:01.650 --> 24:04.278
I can bring you back some
if you're hungry.

24:05.362 --> 24:06.738
It's okay. Honestly, I'm good.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.501
Mom...

24:21.378 --> 24:22.379
I'm sorry.

24:24.423 --> 24:26.175
I didn't mean to say those things. I--

24:27.301 --> 24:28.510
I was just trying to hurt you.

24:29.803 --> 24:31.013
I understand.

24:34.433 --> 24:36.560
I just-- I need more time
to think about it.

24:37.769 --> 24:38.770
I know.

24:40.022 --> 24:41.231
What about your dad?

24:42.274 --> 24:43.483
I'll tell him.

24:45.194 --> 24:47.821
I think I should.
I'll be the one to tell him.

24:49.281 --> 24:51.992
No. You lost that right.

24:52.951 --> 24:53.952
I will.

24:57.831 --> 24:59.041
Okay.

25:19.645 --> 25:21.063
I'm sorry, my friend.

25:21.897 --> 25:23.148
We're friends again?

25:23.815 --> 25:25.234
That happen while I was gone?

25:25.234 --> 25:27.569
Now you're doing this shit?
You're threatening people?

25:27.569 --> 25:29.029
Their families, kids?

25:29.029 --> 25:30.864
Nobody's killing anyone.

25:31.365 --> 25:33.033
Guillermo's just getting their attention.

25:33.033 --> 25:34.535
Well, he's gotten mine.

25:36.286 --> 25:37.496
Isn't that the point of this place?

25:37.496 --> 25:39.498
To protect people,
not put targets on them?

25:39.998 --> 25:42.167
It's so much more complicated than that,
Allie.

25:44.127 --> 25:48.382
Well, you tell your friend that's
the last favor I'm ever doing for him.

25:48.382 --> 25:50.884
I'm out.
-You did it for me.

25:51.385 --> 25:53.178
And Guillermo's not your typical friend.

25:53.679 --> 25:55.848
And these aren't favors
we're doing for him.

25:56.348 --> 25:58.267
This is the price we pay for peace.

25:58.267 --> 25:59.351
What?

25:59.351 --> 26:03.522
He doesn't own the people.
He owns the ground we walk on.

26:03.522 --> 26:05.274
He's our fucking landlord, Allie.

26:06.191 --> 26:08.902
It's a very small community
in a very large jungle.

26:08.902 --> 26:12.072
I've known him for a long time.
He wasn't always like this.

26:12.072 --> 26:14.992
Oh, yeah. No, lifelong pals, right?

26:16.827 --> 26:19.705
I had to say it like that
for you to believe it and play the part.

26:20.706 --> 26:22.416
He had to see me turn on you.

26:22.416 --> 26:23.584
Kiss the fucking ring.

26:25.586 --> 26:27.963
So we're not... You're not--
-No.

26:27.963 --> 26:30.299
I have to keep this person close.

26:30.799 --> 26:34.094
Otherwise, he takes over this whole thing.

26:35.012 --> 26:38.307
Razes the land.
Grows coca, poppy, fucking condominiums.

26:38.891 --> 26:41.685
He could build a whole train track
over this place.

26:42.686 --> 26:46.023
Our people get to own
a lot of things here.

26:47.357 --> 26:50.819
Our home, our minds,
our philosophy, that's ours.

26:50.819 --> 26:53.864
But we don't get to own
the very ground we walk on.

26:55.157 --> 26:58.660
The ground underneath your feet?
That's owned by Guillermo.

26:58.660 --> 26:59.953
So be careful.

27:02.748 --> 27:04.583
What you did today-- What we did today...

27:06.376 --> 27:07.920
We just paid this month's rent.

27:09.463 --> 27:10.464
Fine.

27:10.964 --> 27:12.090
That's Guillermo.

27:12.591 --> 27:16.053
What about Richard?
That's his voice on the tape, right?

27:17.429 --> 27:20.057
Believe it or not, I don't easily forget
people that ruin my life.

27:20.057 --> 27:21.141
I know.

27:24.102 --> 27:26.104
That's a much longer conversation, Allie.

27:46.917 --> 27:48.085
Like that?

27:51.004 --> 27:53.507
You can dance.
-Okay. It's like...

27:58.095 --> 28:00.639
Your history with Richard
is different than mine.

28:01.139 --> 28:04.351
The guy is a zealot. Pompous asshole.

28:04.351 --> 28:06.436
Murderer. Did I mention that?
Should have led with that.

28:06.436 --> 28:07.604
Get off it, will you?

28:08.105 --> 28:10.649
You and him probably agree
on 80% of the issues

28:10.649 --> 28:13.569
except when it comes to
how to solve them or execute them.

28:13.569 --> 28:16.280
Execute. That's exactly the words
that I would have used.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.198
Look, I know it's imperfect,
but he gets things done.

28:18.198 --> 28:19.533
It's exactly what we need.

28:20.367 --> 28:22.661
For what?
-I don't know.

28:23.495 --> 28:24.913
I only know what Guillermo tells me.

28:24.913 --> 28:26.832
Sometimes I'm in the loop,
sometimes I'm not.

28:26.832 --> 28:28.542
But let's get something straight,
you and I.

28:29.793 --> 28:32.212
Let's agree to agree on some things.

28:32.212 --> 28:35.424
You and I both share a hatred
for corrupt authority,

28:35.424 --> 28:38.802
except one of us has the choice
to run away when it suits him.

28:38.802 --> 28:42.556
Oh, no. I have the option of running
in exactly one direction.

28:43.056 --> 28:44.183
And that is away.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.393
Not exactly a choice, is it?

28:46.393 --> 28:51.231
Well, I have 120 people's lives
who I'm responsible for.

28:51.231 --> 28:52.524
I have no choice!

28:53.525 --> 28:54.902
Do you hear that?

28:54.902 --> 28:57.529
I can't run!
I can't afford that luxury, Allie.

28:57.529 --> 28:59.156
So you're gonna resort to terrorism?

29:00.115 --> 29:02.659
Call me old-fashioned,
but that sounds like a choice to me.

29:03.827 --> 29:06.580
You either do do terrorism
or you don't do terrorism.

29:06.580 --> 29:10.334
Believe it or not,
99.999 fucking percent of the world

29:10.334 --> 29:13.128
does not resort
to killing innocent people.

29:14.004 --> 29:15.005
Now, look.

29:15.631 --> 29:20.802
I brought my family here so that
we could build a life that we design.

29:22.471 --> 29:23.764
So, before I get on with that,

29:23.764 --> 29:26.225
let's cut to the chase
and tell me exactly what Guillermo wants.

29:27.559 --> 29:28.560
Sandpiper.

30:06.098 --> 30:07.099
Hey.

30:29.997 --> 30:31.206
You want a taco?

30:32.583 --> 30:33.709
No, I'm good.

30:33.709 --> 30:34.877
You sure?

30:36.503 --> 30:37.671
Yeah, I'm sure.

30:40.549 --> 30:41.842
I'm sorry we fought.

30:44.803 --> 30:46.471
I didn't mean to make you pick sides.

30:47.055 --> 30:48.056
I know.

30:49.141 --> 30:50.225
It's okay.

30:51.226 --> 30:52.644
I'm glad you told me.

30:58.066 --> 30:59.067
Scoot over.

31:06.074 --> 31:08.035
You're my only friend here, you know?

31:10.204 --> 31:11.371
Yeah, I know.

31:26.136 --> 31:29.348
Don't worry, I handled it.

31:31.517 --> 31:32.518
What?

31:37.147 --> 31:38.148
How?

31:40.359 --> 31:41.401
I handled it.

31:42.402 --> 31:43.403
Don't worry.

31:45.864 --> 31:47.115
How did you handle it?

31:47.616 --> 31:49.451
I just told him to stay away, okay?

31:50.327 --> 31:51.328
Charlie.

31:51.828 --> 31:54.164
No, Dina, it's fine. Just trust me.

32:06.718 --> 32:07.719
What?

32:09.137 --> 32:10.138
Here.

32:11.265 --> 32:12.474
I want you to have it.

32:12.975 --> 32:14.476
For good this time.

32:15.435 --> 32:16.520
You love that watch.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.981
It's the only thing I have to give to you.

32:55.225 --> 32:56.852
So, Richard, huh?

32:59.563 --> 33:00.772
Did you speak to him?

33:01.690 --> 33:02.691
Not yet.

33:03.984 --> 33:04.985
You?

33:13.744 --> 33:16.079
Allie, I want you to know
I had no part in this.

33:21.376 --> 33:22.377
So, where have you been?

33:25.172 --> 33:26.256
Doesn't matter.

33:27.966 --> 33:29.384
Everywhere is the same.

33:29.384 --> 33:31.762
Wherever you go,
people want the same thing, you know?

33:32.679 --> 33:33.889
Can't get away from it.

33:33.889 --> 33:36.350
Wanna be left alone? Doesn't matter.

33:36.350 --> 33:38.852
Wanna leave other people alone?
Doesn't matter.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.146
The world betrays you.

33:43.982 --> 33:46.527
Just do as you're goddamn told or else.

33:50.822 --> 33:52.741
This place is owned by a criminal.

33:53.575 --> 33:55.994
And I'm supposed
to go fucking work for him.

33:59.623 --> 34:00.958
We can't stay here.

34:02.751 --> 34:03.794
Not like this.

34:20.060 --> 34:21.186
Do you have a plan?

34:22.020 --> 34:23.355
Not yet.

34:24.773 --> 34:25.774
Well, I do.

34:27.067 --> 34:28.068
There's a way out.

34:31.530 --> 34:33.614
We have something we can offer,
something big.

34:34.408 --> 34:36.534
Something that will get us what we want.

34:38.328 --> 34:40.246
We reach out and make a deal.

34:40.831 --> 34:42.498
We give them Richard Beaumont.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.002
And why would you do that?

34:45.002 --> 34:47.670
Well, they've wanted to
get their hands on Richard for ten years.

34:47.670 --> 34:50.007
He's an Interpol-NSA wet dream.

34:50.007 --> 34:52.676
We ask for immunity for us,
and we go home.

34:55.596 --> 34:59.016
I would never make a deal
with the fucking government.

34:59.600 --> 35:02.186
Yeah, well, maybe it's not about us,
Allie. It's not about you.

35:02.853 --> 35:04.104
Maybe the kids need help.

35:04.605 --> 35:07.858
This experiment, if that's what
it's called, has been a fucking mistake.

35:07.858 --> 35:09.359
We can fix this place.

35:09.359 --> 35:10.903
We can't fix this place.

35:13.447 --> 35:15.032
We get the right homeschooling
up and running.

35:15.032 --> 35:16.283
Oh, my God.

35:16.283 --> 35:18.535
You wanna teach them
this is the capital of Texas? Fine.

35:18.535 --> 35:20.871
I had to drop out of school
to get a real education.

35:21.955 --> 35:25.334
And they are living it here and right now.

35:27.753 --> 35:28.837
Charlie loves the place.

35:28.837 --> 35:32.299
This place is not good for Charlie,
whether he likes it or not.

35:32.299 --> 35:35.052
He's 14, Allie. And Dina too.

35:35.052 --> 35:37.429
So we find another place. The right place.

35:40.766 --> 35:42.643
I just have to figure out what he's doing.

35:44.061 --> 35:47.397
I followed him today,
and he was receiving, I don't know,

35:47.397 --> 35:50.275
weapons or munitions drop or something.

35:50.275 --> 35:51.985
I don't want you getting involved
with him.

35:53.445 --> 35:55.280
I don't want you anywhere near him.

35:57.658 --> 35:59.409
Didn't work out so well last time, did it?

35:59.993 --> 36:01.370
Well, maybe I've changed, Allie.

36:01.370 --> 36:03.163
Doesn't feel like it.

36:03.664 --> 36:06.458
Feels like a second bite
at the same apple.

36:08.293 --> 36:10.254
Allie, we're here
because you dragged us here.

36:11.129 --> 36:13.924
We are here because you murdered someone.

36:14.508 --> 36:19.179
That's the most hateful
mischaracterization of our history.

36:19.763 --> 36:21.932
You've called the shots for 13 years.

36:22.432 --> 36:26.186
But apparently, you've honed
and saved up a toxic piece of poison

36:26.186 --> 36:27.896
to hurl in my fucking face,

36:27.896 --> 36:31.567
when I have fucking agreed
with one fucking thing you've wanted!

36:37.197 --> 36:38.198
You--

36:38.198 --> 36:41.451
We were never supposed to be this unhappy.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.166
You're not doing this.

36:48.166 --> 36:50.502
Well, you're fucking wrong,

36:51.920 --> 36:52.921
because I am.
