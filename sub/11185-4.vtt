[birds chirping]

01:46.529 --> 01:48.087
[rat squeals]

01:52.802 --> 01:55.270
[rat squealing]

03:09.845 --> 03:11.506
[chatters]

03:29.632 --> 03:31.031
[speaking Russian]

03:31.400 --> 03:33.163
[all chattering in Russian]

03:33.235 --> 03:34.395
Nyet.

03:57.693 --> 04:00.821
(Archangel)
You may be
his only hope for escape.

04:01.964 --> 04:04.091
(Hawke)
So you have other options?

04:04.166 --> 04:06.930
Of course.
We could always
invade Russia.

04:08.003 --> 04:11.029
Moses will make his way
to that hunting cabin.

04:11.106 --> 04:13.199
lt's in a remote section
of the Urals,

04:13.242 --> 04:16.404
about 90 kilometers
east of Sverdlovsk.

04:16.478 --> 04:19.538
Marella will give you
precise coordinates
for Airwolf's computer.

04:19.615 --> 04:20.673
Moses?

04:20.749 --> 04:22.774
(Marella)
lf you'd read the dossier,
Stringfellow,

04:22.851 --> 04:24.944
instead of just looking
at all the pretty pictures,

04:25.020 --> 04:28.683
you would know
that Vladimir Rostoff's
code name is Moses.

04:29.959 --> 04:31.187
[whines]

04:31.260 --> 04:32.249
Cute.

04:32.328 --> 04:33.352
Thank you.

04:33.429 --> 04:35.056
(Archangel)
l don't think
either of you realizes

04:35.097 --> 04:37.531
the seriousness
of the situation.

04:37.600 --> 04:38.692
Yes, sir.

04:38.767 --> 04:41.497
lf Moses has blown his cover
after 22 years,

04:41.570 --> 04:43.663
it has to be
for something big.

04:43.739 --> 04:46.105
He's risen higher
than we'd dared hope.

04:46.175 --> 04:48.609
Kept us out of at least
a dozen small wars,

04:48.677 --> 04:51.145
and maybe,
on a couple of occasions,
the big one.

04:51.213 --> 04:52.942
And now, he's thrown
all that away

04:53.015 --> 04:54.277
and whatever it's worth

04:54.350 --> 04:58.047
so you can bet
it has to be for something
damn important.

05:01.824 --> 05:03.086
Who's this?

05:03.158 --> 05:05.388
Natalya and Tanya Rostoff.

05:06.195 --> 05:07.628
So he's got a family?

05:07.696 --> 05:09.789
He's been there
22 years.

05:13.469 --> 05:15.232
l assume you've got
a refueling tanker

05:15.304 --> 05:16.896
somewhere over
the Norwegian basin.

05:16.972 --> 05:18.132
Yes.

05:19.308 --> 05:23.176
That's still
a 3,000-mile round trip
through Russian airspace.

05:24.513 --> 05:27.539
Airwolf can make it,
but not with five people.

05:29.318 --> 05:31.252
She can
if you strip the armament.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.514
[Hawke laughs]

05:32.588 --> 05:36.354
You're asking me
to fly Airwolf into Russia
without any guns?

05:37.059 --> 05:38.754
lt's the only way.

05:38.861 --> 05:42.194
lt's not exactly
like pulling a mole
out of lndian territory.

05:42.264 --> 05:42.889
(Archangel)
l told you.

05:42.931 --> 05:46.799
He's got something big
or he wouldn't be coming out.

05:48.170 --> 05:49.899
(Marella)
Rostoff is no ordinary agent.

05:49.972 --> 05:51.872
On his first assignment
he was decorated

05:51.940 --> 05:53.669
for saving the life
of a fellow agent

05:53.742 --> 05:54.902
when the mission went sour.

05:54.977 --> 05:56.308
Marella.

05:57.813 --> 06:01.408
That agent's name is
Michael Goldsmith Briggs lll.

06:01.850 --> 06:03.078
(Marella)
Code named--

06:03.152 --> 06:04.619
Archangel.

06:04.887 --> 06:06.582
That has nothing
to do with it.

06:06.655 --> 06:08.520
(Hawke)
Of course not.

06:09.992 --> 06:11.425
Will you take the mission?

06:14.129 --> 06:15.619
''The Third,'' huh?

06:18.133 --> 06:20.795
l wouldn't throw stones,
Stringfellow.

06:41.256 --> 06:42.348
(Marella)
Sir,

06:42.424 --> 06:44.517
could I play devil's advocate
for a moment?

06:44.593 --> 06:45.992
(Archangel)
I encourage it.

06:46.061 --> 06:48.052
Well, some of our
sister agencies suspect

06:48.130 --> 06:50.257
that we're in liaison
with Hawke and Airwolf.

06:50.332 --> 06:52.823
They haven't been able
to prove it.

06:52.901 --> 06:53.959
No, sir.

06:54.036 --> 06:56.561
But you can be sure
that if they suspect,
so do the Russians.

06:56.638 --> 06:58.731
And that this
might possibly be

06:58.807 --> 07:01.901
an elaborate effort
by the Soviets
to capture Airwolf.

07:01.977 --> 07:05.538
Anything is possible,
but it's not very probable.

07:05.714 --> 07:08.410
I agree,
unless one of two things
has happened.

07:08.484 --> 07:11.578
One.: the Soviets
have uncovered Moses
and are using him.

07:11.653 --> 07:13.780
Giving him something
that he thinks is so important

07:13.856 --> 07:15.653
he's got to bring us in
to extract him.

07:15.724 --> 07:17.624
No. If the KGB
uncovered him,

07:17.693 --> 07:19.388
they wouldn't risk
his slipping away

07:19.461 --> 07:21.326
in a ruse
to capture Airwolf.

07:21.397 --> 07:22.591
Two.:

07:24.266 --> 07:26.962
he's been living in Russia
for over 20 years.

07:27.035 --> 07:29.526
He's got a wife,
daughter, friends.

07:29.605 --> 07:31.368
He may have turned.

07:32.174 --> 07:34.142
I didn't say
you would like it.

07:34.209 --> 07:35.938
I think it stinks.

07:37.079 --> 07:38.376
Yes, sir.

07:43.552 --> 07:46.453
(Archangel)
I assume you've run
these scenarios of yours

07:46.522 --> 07:48.251
through the computer?

07:48.323 --> 07:50.291
(Marella)
Yes, sir.
I took the statistics

07:50.359 --> 07:52.224
from all our
counterintelligence agencies,

07:52.294 --> 07:53.761
both foreign and domestic,

07:53.829 --> 07:56.024
who operate
deep undercover agents.

07:56.098 --> 07:58.726
I cross-referenced them
with those that have turned

07:58.801 --> 08:00.894
and added
the psychological probability

08:00.969 --> 08:03.096
of change
due to midlife crisis,

08:03.172 --> 08:05.140
sexual promiscuity,
children reaching--

08:05.207 --> 08:08.005
Damn it, Marella,
what's the bottom line?

08:10.679 --> 08:12.340
The odds are 50-50

08:12.414 --> 08:15.178
that Hawke is flying Airwolf
into a trap.

08:36.538 --> 08:38.802
(Dominic)
lt's the stupidest plan
l ever heard.

08:38.874 --> 08:41.365
(Dominic)
Some Russky out hunting bear
with a bow and arrow

08:41.443 --> 08:42.568
could bring us down.

08:42.644 --> 08:44.771
(Hawke)
They'd better have
armor-piercing arrows.

08:44.847 --> 08:46.974
Oh, you know what l mean.

08:47.082 --> 08:48.606
Yeah.
You don't like the plan.

08:48.684 --> 08:50.879
[exclaims]
l think it stinks.

08:50.953 --> 08:52.079
You got a better one?

08:52.154 --> 08:54.782
You bet.
Let's not go at all.

08:54.857 --> 08:57.690
[both laughing]

09:04.433 --> 09:06.560
[vehicle approaching]

09:14.643 --> 09:16.076
[Dominic sighs]

09:16.144 --> 09:18.669
No matter how many times
l see her,

09:18.814 --> 09:21.112
she still
takes my breath away.

09:24.019 --> 09:25.247
Yeah.

09:35.964 --> 09:36.988
[clicking]

09:37.065 --> 09:38.589
[gauges beep]

09:38.700 --> 09:40.725
[engine whirring]

09:40.836 --> 09:43.634
[beeping]

09:47.342 --> 09:48.331
[beeping]

10:41.863 --> 10:43.888
(pilot)
$10 it's an SR-7 1.

10:44.967 --> 10:46.696
(co-pilot)
Harrier Jet.

10:46.768 --> 10:47.792
(pilot)
What the hell
would we be doing

10:47.836 --> 10:50.862
refueling a Harrier
within spitting distance
of Russia?

10:50.939 --> 10:53.066
I don't know the mission.
I just know it's a Harrier.

10:53.141 --> 10:56.110
Why else would we be using
a straight line refueling rig?

10:56.178 --> 10:59.113
An SR-7 1 uses
a straight line
refueling rig.

11:00.415 --> 11:02.178
I didn't know that.

11:02.651 --> 11:05.051
That's why you're
gonna lose $10.

11:06.388 --> 11:08.288
(Tembrusco)
Captain, I--I...

11:08.357 --> 11:11.758
(Tembrusco)
I have an--an aircraft
approaching for hookup.

11:11.827 --> 11:13.556
(pilot)
What is it?

11:13.629 --> 11:16.496
(Tembrusco)
I'd rather not say, sir.

11:38.286 --> 11:39.810
(Dominic)
According to the computer,

11:39.888 --> 11:42.880
we'll be penetrating
Soviet airspace
in six minutes.

11:42.958 --> 11:44.482
(Hawke)
Right.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.019
That's all
you got to say?

11:47.763 --> 11:48.923
For now.

11:50.232 --> 11:52.427
We're going on the deck
the rest of the way.

11:52.501 --> 11:53.627
Oh.

11:54.202 --> 11:56.295
I was afraid it'd be
something like that.

11:56.371 --> 11:57.702
[snorts]

11:57.806 --> 12:00.104
What do you call
''on the deck''?

12:00.809 --> 12:03.607
(Hawke)
About 50 feet.
Give or take a few.

12:03.679 --> 12:05.670
It ain't the 50 feet
I'm worried about.

12:05.747 --> 12:07.647
It's the give or take.

12:07.716 --> 12:09.445
[beeping]

12:09.851 --> 12:11.478
(Dominic)
Uh-oh.

12:12.487 --> 12:14.421
(Dominic)
I got two bogies. Angels 30.

12:14.489 --> 12:16.582
(Dominic)
Closing fast
on a heading of 015.

12:16.658 --> 12:18.125
(Hawke)
MiGs?

12:25.734 --> 12:27.326
(Dominic)
MiG 23s.

12:27.402 --> 12:29.336
Hey, l thought
this was Finland.

12:29.404 --> 12:31.429
I don't think the Soviets
pay too much attention

12:31.506 --> 12:33.303
to road signs
around their borders.

12:33.375 --> 12:34.399
Hang on.

13:10.145 --> 13:12.170
They're
directly overhead.

13:12.247 --> 13:13.612
Altitude?

13:13.982 --> 13:15.381
(Dominic)
Angels 30.

13:15.450 --> 13:18.112
(Dominic)
I'm absorbing 90%
of their radar scans.

13:18.186 --> 13:21.815
(Dominic)
They're maintaining altitude.
Heading northeast.

13:21.890 --> 13:25.223
(Dominic)
Hey, I don't think
they spotted us, String.

13:33.835 --> 13:36.827
Ooh, when the sun
goes down here,
it really goes down, huh?

13:36.905 --> 13:38.896
(Hawke)
It comes up just as fast.

13:38.974 --> 13:42.137
We have about eight hours
this time of the year.

13:42.644 --> 13:45.704
Three in, three out,
and two to pick Moses up.

13:46.281 --> 13:48.476
(Dominic)
Uh-oh. Maybe less.

13:48.884 --> 13:51.284
(Dominic)
Those MiGs are descending
and coming back.

13:51.353 --> 13:53.913
Now, why would they
do a thing like that?

13:53.989 --> 13:56.514
Well, Dom,
they might've spotted us.

14:15.877 --> 14:19.040
(Dominic)
They're climbing.
I think they lost us.

14:22.784 --> 14:25.776
Oh, my God,
nobody can fly blind this low.

14:25.954 --> 14:27.114
(Hawke)
I know.

14:27.189 --> 14:28.451
Then pull up.

14:28.523 --> 14:31.083
I can't.
The Russians would
pick us up on radar.

14:31.159 --> 14:33.627
It's better than
in little pieces.

14:37.766 --> 14:40.200
(Dominic)
Oh, String, this is nuts.

14:40.268 --> 14:41.963
Those MiGs gone?

14:42.037 --> 14:44.198
Yeah, moving off the grid
to the north.

14:44.272 --> 14:47.503
Turn on my helmet view.
It's the C.C. panel.

14:50.212 --> 14:52.271
[machine humming]

14:52.881 --> 14:55.441
(Dominic)
Mamma mia!
What is that?

14:55.517 --> 14:57.144
(Hawke)
S.L.A.S.

14:58.220 --> 15:00.552
Starlight
amplification system.

15:01.056 --> 15:03.820
It amplifies available light
a million times.

15:03.892 --> 15:05.519
Turns night into day.

15:05.594 --> 15:07.687
Oh, that's
great, String.

15:07.762 --> 15:09.730
But now that
the MiGs are gone,

15:09.798 --> 15:12.028
can't we go up
just a little?

15:13.435 --> 15:15.903
Yeah, I guess
we can ease up a few feet.

15:15.971 --> 15:17.370
Thank you.

15:30.085 --> 15:32.246
(Archangel)
Well, if they haven't
snagged a snowdrift

15:32.320 --> 15:34.379
or been run over
by a herd of reindeer,

15:34.456 --> 15:36.981
they should be approaching
that cabin just about now.

15:37.058 --> 15:38.218
Then one way or another

15:38.293 --> 15:39.885
we should know
what's happening soon.

15:39.961 --> 15:41.952
We won't,
but they will.

15:42.764 --> 15:44.595
(Marella)
Knightsbridge,
this is Angel One.

15:44.666 --> 15:46.691
(Marella)
I'm five miles out
over the main gate.

15:46.768 --> 15:48.929
(Marella)
Request a Jericho approach
to the pad.

15:49.004 --> 15:50.631
(controller)
Angel One. Knightsbridge.

15:50.705 --> 15:52.900
Approach approved.
You are cleared to land.

16:34.582 --> 16:36.140
(Dominic)
According to the computer,

16:36.217 --> 16:38.412
we're within 10 kilometers
of the cabin.

16:38.486 --> 16:40.750
(Dominic)
No, wait.
You better slow down.

16:40.822 --> 16:43.290
We're four, three,
two, one.

16:47.762 --> 16:50.890
String, I got a heat source at
three o'clock 100 meters up.

16:50.966 --> 16:51.990
Could be human.

16:52.067 --> 16:53.967
(Hawke)
Hit the lights.

17:07.147 --> 17:08.775
Invite him
into the clearing.

17:08.849 --> 17:09.942
(Dominic)
Right.

17:12.554 --> 17:15.250
[computer beeping]

17:21.762 --> 17:24.993
(Dominic)
Hey, see if you can get him
to look up, will you?

17:25.200 --> 17:26.531
[thudding]

17:27.902 --> 17:29.233
I said
get him to look up,

17:29.304 --> 17:30.931
not scare the hell
out of me.

17:31.006 --> 17:33.031
Sorry. Is it him?

17:34.109 --> 17:36.270
(Dominic)
A little older, but it's him.

17:36.344 --> 17:38.676
You got any other
heat sources?

17:40.115 --> 17:41.207
Nope.

17:41.282 --> 17:42.306
That's too bad.

17:42.384 --> 17:44.511
Why, you looking for trouble?

17:44.586 --> 17:46.577
No. But if Rostoff's
bringing his family out,

17:46.654 --> 17:50.112
there ought to be
two other heat sources
somewhere in the area.

18:20.889 --> 18:22.720
[gauges beep]

18:36.471 --> 18:37.733
Rostoff?

18:44.779 --> 18:47.043
l came to take you
home, Moses.

18:50.351 --> 18:52.478
l thought you were
Soviet military.

18:52.554 --> 18:54.215
Why, are they
hunting you?

18:54.289 --> 18:55.847
l must assume so.

18:55.924 --> 18:58.324
They may have deduced by now
it was no accident.

18:58.393 --> 18:59.519
What?

18:59.627 --> 19:02.323
l've been without sleep
for three days.

19:02.931 --> 19:05.024
My thinking
is a bit muddled.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.829
l stole a biological weapon

19:06.901 --> 19:09.893
and covered the theft
by creating an accident,

19:09.971 --> 19:11.632
a fatal accident.

19:12.006 --> 19:14.236
Some of them were my friends.

19:19.514 --> 19:20.947
lt must be some weapon.

19:21.015 --> 19:22.141
lt is.

19:22.217 --> 19:24.685
Aircarried.
Lethal in two seconds.

19:24.752 --> 19:27.380
Totally undetectable
and untraceable.

19:27.555 --> 19:29.955
The only deterrent
is for both sides to have it

19:30.024 --> 19:32.390
then each will fear
retaliation.

19:34.262 --> 19:36.093
Archangel was right.

19:36.531 --> 19:38.726
You are an exceptional man.

19:39.567 --> 19:41.125
How is Michael?

19:41.769 --> 19:44.067
Oh, he's a little
the worse for wear

19:44.139 --> 19:45.470
but he's still recruiting
the most beautiful

19:45.507 --> 19:48.670
and intelligent women
in the world.

19:49.110 --> 19:52.011
l used to think
that would be his downfall.

19:52.447 --> 19:54.938
Now l think
it may be his strength.

19:55.416 --> 19:56.610
We gotta get going.

19:56.684 --> 19:58.276
Yes, of course.

19:59.154 --> 20:01.019
Where is your family?

20:02.123 --> 20:04.853
They're waiting at Kirivitz,
200 kilometers east of here.

20:04.926 --> 20:07.190
Hey, l'm not running
a shuttle bus service.

20:07.262 --> 20:10.060
l didn't know how long
it would take the Firm
to extract me.

20:10.131 --> 20:12.656
l couldn't risk my family
being caught here with me.

20:12.734 --> 20:14.599
My orders are
to get you out.

20:14.669 --> 20:17.467
You would separate
a man from his family?

20:17.639 --> 20:18.936
lf l had to.

20:19.007 --> 20:20.099
Yes.

20:20.175 --> 20:22.905
That's why l left
the serum l stole
with my wife.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.127
Your helicopter,
it's incredible.

20:48.203 --> 20:49.670
Mach 1 plus.

20:49.737 --> 20:51.568
(Rostoff)
We have nothing like this.

20:51.639 --> 20:53.004
(Dominic)
What do you mean ''we''?

20:53.074 --> 20:54.905
I mean the Soviets.

20:54.976 --> 20:57.171
I.R. jamming.
Automatic
defense system.

20:57.245 --> 20:58.303
Stealth mode.

20:58.379 --> 21:00.347
(Rostoff)
A choice of 14
offensive weapons.

21:00.415 --> 21:01.404
[chuckling]
We wish.

21:01.482 --> 21:02.779
We had to strip the guns to--

21:02.850 --> 21:04.613
(Hawke)
Dom.
Huh?

21:04.986 --> 21:07.216
(Hawke)
Have you got that readout
on Kirivitz?

21:07.288 --> 21:08.755
Of course.

21:08.823 --> 21:10.620
You had to trade
weight for fuel.

21:10.892 --> 21:13.190
You have nothing
to shoot with, do you?

21:14.796 --> 21:17.196
I always save
a little something.

21:23.905 --> 21:25.236
Kirivitz.

21:28.676 --> 21:31.042
(Dominic)
Agra community.
1,200 people.

21:31.112 --> 21:33.706
62 degrees north,
51 degrees west.

21:34.716 --> 21:36.843
My family will be
at my wife's
brother's farm,

21:36.918 --> 21:38.317
north of the village.

21:38.386 --> 21:39.751
Hey, String.

21:39.821 --> 21:41.618
There's a Soviet
missile complex

21:41.689 --> 21:42.849
all around Kirivitz.

21:42.924 --> 21:45.449
It's gotta have
more security than Fort Knox.

21:45.526 --> 21:47.585
The missiles were removed
three months ago.

21:47.662 --> 21:49.857
(Rostoff)
Those silos are empty
and so are the barracks.

21:49.931 --> 21:52.195
(Rostoff)
It's part of the air defense
rotation program.

21:52.267 --> 21:54.360
(Dominic)
Yeah, but that's not
what the computer says.

21:54.435 --> 21:56.232
Then the computer
is wrong.

21:56.304 --> 21:58.829
Archangel gave us
the latest tapes
for this mission.

21:58.906 --> 22:01.875
Then there is obviously
an intelligence lag.

22:02.243 --> 22:03.870
Or you're lying.

22:12.086 --> 22:13.644
[owl hooting]

22:14.188 --> 22:15.553

22:24.432 --> 22:27.993

22:28.169 --> 22:30.034
(Rostoff)
We are how far
from the farmhouse?

22:30.104 --> 22:31.571
(Dominic)
10,000 meters.

22:31.639 --> 22:32.970
Amazing.

22:34.475 --> 22:36.033
(Dominic)
I count five people.

22:36.110 --> 22:38.340
(Rostoff)
My family
and Turgyev's wife and son.

22:38.413 --> 22:39.471
What do you think, Dom?

22:39.547 --> 22:40.571
(Dominic)
Why ask me now?

22:40.648 --> 22:43.708
I don't think
we should've have taken
this job in the first place.

22:43.785 --> 22:45.912
I think we should have
gone home from the cabin.

22:45.987 --> 22:47.921
And I think we're walking
right into a trap.

22:47.989 --> 22:50.219
And I think
that you're gonna do
whatever you're gonna do

22:50.291 --> 22:51.349
no matter what I think.

22:51.426 --> 22:52.859
So why you asking me
what I think?

22:52.927 --> 22:54.053
(Hawke)
Hey, sorry.

22:54.629 --> 22:56.654
(Rostoff)
There is a missile silo
a mile to the west

22:56.731 --> 22:58.255
and another
a mile and a half south.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.324
They're both connected
to the road
that's in front of the farm.

23:00.368 --> 23:02.928
As I said, they are empty,
so you can take your pick.

23:03.004 --> 23:04.062
Dom?

23:04.138 --> 23:07.107
(Dominic)
Now, let's see.
I've got a small clearing,

23:07.175 --> 23:09.234
big enough, but not too big.

23:09.310 --> 23:10.868
There's a creek
that runs through it

23:10.945 --> 23:13.243
to the farm
about 1,500 meters

23:13.314 --> 23:15.179
on a heading of 215.

23:15.550 --> 23:16.778
Okay.

23:39.474 --> 23:42.534

24:15.743 --> 24:16.869

Nice, huh?

24:16.944 --> 24:18.878
(Rostoff)
Turgyev has a great voice.

24:18.946 --> 24:21.414
He used to sing
in the army choir.

24:21.616 --> 24:23.777
[humming]

24:23.851 --> 24:26.149
Kind of catchy.
Where've l heard that before?

24:26.220 --> 24:29.417
lt's a song of bloodshed.
Of struggle. Of glory.

24:29.624 --> 24:31.148
A song of the Revolution.

24:31.259 --> 24:32.556
¢Ü¢Ü[Turgyev continues singing]

24:32.627 --> 24:34.959

Oh, now l remember.

24:35.029 --> 24:38.123
You mean l've been humming
a Communist song?

24:38.199 --> 24:41.691
Think of it
as a Russian version of
Yankee Doodle Dandy.

24:42.003 --> 24:45.564
¢Ü¢Ü[Turgyev continues singing]

24:47.442 --> 24:50.240

let's have a look.

25:16.070 --> 25:17.731
Just your family, huh?

25:17.805 --> 25:19.534
(Rostoff)
Turgyev's in
the local militia.

25:19.607 --> 25:20.631
They must be his friends.

25:20.708 --> 25:21.800
(Dominic)
Oh, really?

25:21.876 --> 25:23.173
Probably on a routine patrol

25:23.244 --> 25:25.542
checking the empty
missile silos.

25:25.880 --> 25:27.541
(Rostoff)
To guard against vandalism.

25:27.615 --> 25:29.139
With AK-47 s?

25:29.417 --> 25:31.578
l'll get rid of them.
(Hawke)
No.

25:32.153 --> 25:34.621
You yourself said
we were on a tight schedule.

25:34.689 --> 25:37.419
Did you ever think
that maybe your accident
has been discovered

25:37.492 --> 25:39.153
and they're here
to pick you up?

25:39.227 --> 25:42.196
They don't send
the local militia
for that, Mr. Hawke.

25:42.263 --> 25:43.696
(Hawke)
Hey.

25:44.999 --> 25:46.466
[gun clicks]

25:48.269 --> 25:49.827

and you lose the serum.

25:50.972 --> 25:52.837

25:56.911 --> 25:59.243
[thunder rumbling]

25:59.313 --> 26:01.406
(Marella)
The 1800 situation report
is in.

26:02.283 --> 26:03.409
Well?

26:05.887 --> 26:07.684
There's unusual
Soviet air activity

26:07.755 --> 26:09.586
near the Manchurian border.

26:09.657 --> 26:11.887
Over 2,000 miles
from Airwolf.

26:13.294 --> 26:15.319
A satellite was launched
at 1 200 Zulu time

26:15.396 --> 26:17.387
from their space center
at Baikonur.

26:17.465 --> 26:18.625
Orbit?

26:18.699 --> 26:19.825
North-south elliptical,

26:19.901 --> 26:21.664
covering England,
France, ltaly.

26:21.736 --> 26:25.228
They're beefing up
their M.R. Missile
spotting network.

26:25.306 --> 26:27.866
Armored activity
near Polish border.

26:28.309 --> 26:30.504
There was a work stoppage
at Lodz yesterday.

26:30.578 --> 26:33.547
The Russians are just
flexing their muscles.

26:33.614 --> 26:36.139
And the rest was on
the 1 200 report.

26:38.119 --> 26:39.381
What is it?

26:39.453 --> 26:42.183
An update in
the communication section.

26:42.256 --> 26:44.622
''lncreased radio traffic
on KGB frequencies

26:44.692 --> 26:46.990
''throughout the central Urals.

26:49.997 --> 26:52.659
Specifically in
the Sverdlovsk area.''

(Dominic)
Sounds like one of them
sad ltalian arias, huh?

27:07.548 --> 27:09.448
(Rostoff)
lt's a song
about a young couple

27:15.690 --> 27:17.783
This was sung on
the steppes of Russia

27:17.858 --> 27:20.292
long before
Shakespeare was born.

27:20.595 --> 27:23.086
He probably stole
the idea from us.

27:23.731 --> 27:26.222
There you go with
that ''us'' again.

27:26.734 --> 27:28.759
l am Russian,
Mr. Santini.

27:30.438 --> 27:32.702

an American.

a coal-mining town
in Pennsylvania,

27:35.443 --> 27:37.104
of Russian parents.

27:37.178 --> 27:40.113
l was rocked to sleep
to Russian lullabies.

27:40.181 --> 27:42.775

And when l fell in love,
it was with a Russian girl.

27:50.958 --> 27:54.189

and political conviction.

30:42.997 --> 30:44.362
(Hawke)
Tanya, l like your spunk

30:44.431 --> 30:47.628
but if you don't start
speaking English
l'm gonna spank your butt.

30:53.107 --> 30:55.166
(Rostoff)
Stop it, Tanya.

30:55.442 --> 30:57.137
(Rostoff)
l'm doing what l feel l must.

30:57.211 --> 31:00.203
Not for America, for people.
For Russians and Americans.

31:00.281 --> 31:02.181
[speaking Russian]

31:05.686 --> 31:07.745
By betraying our country?

31:07.822 --> 31:09.756
lt's not a simple matter
of betrayal.

31:09.824 --> 31:11.792
lt seems simple to me.

31:12.426 --> 31:14.257
That's because
you are young and naive.

31:14.328 --> 31:15.693
Perhaps.

31:15.863 --> 31:19.856
But l am old enough to know
that l will not betray
my country.

31:22.536 --> 31:23.935
Nor l mine.

31:26.106 --> 31:28.165
But Russia is your country.

31:28.242 --> 31:30.676
No, Tanya.
Russia is my heritage.

31:30.744 --> 31:32.371
The United States
is my country

31:32.446 --> 31:34.038
and l took an oath
to protect it,

31:34.114 --> 31:36.207
even if it cost me
my life.

31:41.021 --> 31:44.513
[helicopter approaching]

31:49.597 --> 31:51.531
(Hawke)
l suppose it's just
the local militia

31:51.599 --> 31:53.191
dropping by
for some tea, huh?

31:53.267 --> 31:55.633
(Rostoff)
They know the lab
was not an accident.

31:56.470 --> 31:58.461
(Dominic)
ls it Russian?

31:58.706 --> 32:00.401
(Dominic)
Never mind.

32:00.507 --> 32:01.735
[helicopter whirring]

32:01.809 --> 32:04.539
(Rostoff)
We can try for your helicopter
if one of us decoys them.

32:04.612 --> 32:06.705
[Natalya yells in Russian]

32:23.397 --> 32:25.490

32:34.475 --> 32:36.466
[pilot continues
shouting in Russian]

32:36.543 --> 32:39.137
(pilot speaking English)
Do not move or I will shoot.

32:41.282 --> 32:44.376
[pilot shouting in Russian]

32:48.422 --> 32:51.152
On the count of three,
douse that light.

32:51.425 --> 32:52.722
And you get that lamp.

32:52.793 --> 32:54.556
And then hide behind
that stove.

32:54.628 --> 32:55.788
You ready?
Da.

32:55.863 --> 32:57.023
One.

32:57.598 --> 32:58.997
(Dominic)
Two.

32:59.066 --> 33:00.363
[glass breaking]

33:00.434 --> 33:01.594
(Dominic)
Three.

33:01.669 --> 33:05.002
[Natalya and Tanya sobbing]

33:07.041 --> 33:08.941
[women screaming]

33:17.451 --> 33:18.679
(Dominic)
Anybody hit?

33:18.752 --> 33:19.776
(Rostoff)
No.

33:19.853 --> 33:21.377
[Rostoff speaking Russian]

33:21.455 --> 33:23.252
(Hawke)
Don't shoot.

33:25.859 --> 33:28.384
(Dominic)
lf my reflexes
were just a little faster,

33:28.462 --> 33:30.430
you'd have been a dead bunny.

33:30.497 --> 33:32.192
l was counting on that.

33:32.266 --> 33:33.733
(Dominic)
T-Turgyev?

33:33.801 --> 33:35.564
(Hawke)
He's okay.

33:35.903 --> 33:37.734
(Hawke)
Took off toward the road,
l think.

33:37.805 --> 33:38.931
[helicopter whirring]

33:39.006 --> 33:40.064
(Rostoff)
What is it?

33:40.140 --> 33:41.198
(Hawke)
Get down!

33:41.275 --> 33:42.833
[guns firing]

33:43.911 --> 33:45.606
[women screaming]

33:50.985 --> 33:52.850
[helicopter receding]

33:52.920 --> 33:54.581
He's not trying
to kill us.

33:54.655 --> 33:56.850
Yeah? You couldn't
prove it by me.

33:56.924 --> 33:58.824
No, he's shooting high.

33:59.059 --> 34:00.583
Or trying to keep us
pinned down

34:00.661 --> 34:02.219
till they get
ground support.

34:02.896 --> 34:05.091
We'll have to decoy him
to get out of here.

34:05.165 --> 34:07.258
(Rostoff)
l will do it if you
will get my family out.

34:07.334 --> 34:08.733
No, Papa. No!

34:08.802 --> 34:10.827
We will not go
without you.

34:10.971 --> 34:15.840
[Rostoff speaking Russian]

34:16.010 --> 34:17.068
Nyet!

34:17.143 --> 34:19.043
[sobbing]
Nyet.

34:19.612 --> 34:21.774
(Hawke)
Hey, Moses, l don't know
what they're saying,

34:21.849 --> 34:24.147
but it sounds like
''no'' to me.

34:24.485 --> 34:26.578
l'm not gonna haul
two screaming, kicking women

34:26.652 --> 34:28.678
through the woods
in the dark.

34:28.755 --> 34:30.280
Not when there's
another way.

34:30.357 --> 34:31.984
What other way?

34:32.059 --> 34:35.187
Hey, she ain't got
no guns, remember?

34:36.463 --> 34:38.158
[glass breaking]

34:38.232 --> 34:39.927
[women screaming]

34:42.101 --> 34:45.435
[bullets ricocheting]

34:46.739 --> 34:48.731
And in case
you hadn't noticed,

34:48.809 --> 34:50.174
he does.

34:50.677 --> 34:53.510
Yeah, well, l figure that'll
just about make it even.

34:53.580 --> 34:55.172
[guns firing]

34:55.248 --> 34:56.944
[women screaming]

35:02.990 --> 35:05.686
[clock ticking]

35:09.563 --> 35:11.554
(Marella)
Do you want something to eat?

35:14.968 --> 35:16.060
What?

35:16.170 --> 35:18.001
Can l get you a sandwich
or some hot soup?

35:18.072 --> 35:19.164
l could send to--

35:19.239 --> 35:21.332
Oh, no, no,
thank you, no.

35:24.978 --> 35:27.208
Oh, not yet,
please, Marella.

35:27.881 --> 35:30.008
l wanna enjoy the sunset.

35:37.057 --> 35:38.422
l'm sorry.

35:38.659 --> 35:39.990
For what?

35:41.695 --> 35:43.185
For being right.

35:43.263 --> 35:45.561
Don't write
this mission off yet.

35:45.632 --> 35:47.964
But it's sunrise
over the Urals.

35:48.035 --> 35:51.198
Hawke was supposed to
rendezvous with the tanker

35:51.572 --> 35:53.199
15 minutes ago.

35:55.008 --> 35:58.774
That doesn't mean he's failed.
Just that he's late.

35:59.146 --> 36:01.842
Sir, if l were
to put this mission
through my computer right now,

36:01.915 --> 36:04.042
the odds would be
a 1,000-to-1 against it.

36:04.118 --> 36:05.608
Probably higher.

36:05.686 --> 36:08.280
But we've got
one thing going for us.

36:08.989 --> 36:10.013
What?

36:10.090 --> 36:12.251
Hawke doesn't know the odds.

36:32.112 --> 36:33.443
(Rostoff)
He must hate me.

36:33.514 --> 36:34.981
(Dominic)
Who, Turgyev?

36:35.048 --> 36:36.276
No.

36:36.717 --> 36:39.345
Not the way
he greeted you last night.

36:40.220 --> 36:43.053
Oh, he...
He may be hurt and angry.

36:44.158 --> 36:45.352
But given time,

36:45.425 --> 36:47.825
he'll remember
all the good things
between you.

36:48.762 --> 36:50.889
You say you sang together?

36:51.165 --> 36:52.723
All the time.

36:53.367 --> 36:54.834
(Rostoff)
Our families used to say

36:54.902 --> 36:56.870
we drove them crazy,
but they loved it.

36:56.937 --> 36:58.495
(Rostoff)
Especially the children.

36:58.572 --> 37:00.631
(Dominic)
He'll remember.

37:00.741 --> 37:02.504
[birds chirping]

37:02.976 --> 37:05.410
You're a philosopher,
Mr. Santini.

37:05.646 --> 37:07.841
Me? No.

37:08.916 --> 37:10.941
l've just lived a little.

37:17.925 --> 37:19.688
And l'd like to continue.

37:26.500 --> 37:28.934
l wonder
what the hell
he's up to.

37:57.097 --> 37:58.428
(Rostoff)
lt is over.

37:58.498 --> 37:59.897
No. We ain't finished yet.

37:59.967 --> 38:02.401
At least he got out
with the serum.

38:02.469 --> 38:04.937
What are you talking about?
Hawke?

38:05.839 --> 38:09.172
Of course.
He did what he had to do:
get the serum back.

38:09.243 --> 38:11.609
Yeah, well,
you don't know Hawke.

38:20.020 --> 38:21.282
l'm gonna teach you

38:21.355 --> 38:24.119
to sit up there
and make life miserable.

38:55.355 --> 38:57.255
[laughing]

40:14.468 --> 40:16.800
[guns continue firing]

41:45.392 --> 41:48.259
(pilot)
I still can't figure
Sgt. Tembrusco.

41:48.328 --> 41:51.764
He's flown on and off
as my crew chief
for five years.

41:52.499 --> 41:55.263
I've never seen him
act so weird before.

41:55.535 --> 41:57.264
Maybe that's why.

41:58.338 --> 41:59.669
I don't follow you.

41:59.739 --> 42:01.832
Well, he knows it's a Harrier.

42:01.908 --> 42:04.706
He just didn't want you
to lose the bet.

42:04.878 --> 42:07.847
It was not a Harrier.
It was an SR-7 1.

42:07.914 --> 42:10.314
Then why didn't
Tembrusco say so?

42:10.383 --> 42:12.374
I don't know.
Something's wrong.

42:12.452 --> 42:14.579
(pilot)
This is the first flight
he's missed since--

42:14.654 --> 42:15.814
(Munga)
Capt. Nuzo,

42:15.889 --> 42:18.414
I have an aircraft
approaching for hookup.

42:20.260 --> 42:21.557
Same bet?

42:22.462 --> 42:23.827
You're on.

42:24.197 --> 42:26.461
Airman,
what's your name, son?

42:26.833 --> 42:28.801
Uh, Airman Munga, sir.

42:29.503 --> 42:32.063
What kind of aircraft
is that, Munga?

42:32.372 --> 42:33.930
Uh, type, sir?

42:34.374 --> 42:36.706
That's right, Airman.
What type?

42:37.377 --> 42:39.937
(Munga)
Uh, it's a helicopter, sir.

42:41.848 --> 42:43.873
Where'd you get
this guy?

42:45.519 --> 42:47.248
[birds chirping]

42:50.557 --> 42:53.685
[clock ticking]

42:55.862 --> 42:56.920
l was wrong.

42:56.997 --> 42:58.726
Hmm? What?

43:04.604 --> 43:06.128
0600 Zulu.

43:06.206 --> 43:08.401
Aircraft linkup with

43:12.445 --> 43:14.777
[laughing]
Hawke did it!

43:15.081 --> 43:16.708
Yeah, try to control yourself.

43:16.783 --> 43:17.841
Yes, sir.

43:17.918 --> 43:21.354
You're acting like a trainee
on her first mission
instead of...

43:21.421 --> 43:23.184
[whoops]
He did it!

43:24.824 --> 43:25.916
All right.

43:26.159 --> 43:28.559
[wind whistling]

43:29.896 --> 43:31.955
(Dominic)
l haven't had halupkis
since l was a kid.

43:32.032 --> 43:33.522
(Dominic)
And my friend Milo's mom,

43:33.600 --> 43:35.659
they were Russian, too,
she made it for me.

43:35.735 --> 43:37.600
A-and then there was
a special soup

43:37.671 --> 43:39.195
that she used to make
for Christmas.

43:39.272 --> 43:42.264
With, uh, pasta and,
uh, little meatballs.

43:43.476 --> 43:45.444
(Natalya)
l never heard of that.

43:45.512 --> 43:46.979
(Dominic)
Oh?

43:47.347 --> 43:49.315
Well, maybe that was
Ling Soo's mom.

43:49.382 --> 43:50.940
They were Chinese,
you know.

43:51.017 --> 43:52.450
[all laugh]

43:53.553 --> 43:55.783
So, uh, tell me, Mr. Rostoff,

43:56.389 --> 43:58.823
what was Michael like
in the early days?

43:58.892 --> 44:01.690
''Early days''?
You make me sound ancient.

44:02.729 --> 44:05.789
Michael, you do look
a little the worse for wear.

44:05.865 --> 44:07.526
All earned
in the line of duty.

44:07.601 --> 44:08.898

Give her time, Vlad.

44:32.158 --> 44:33.955
[liquid pouring]

44:34.027 --> 44:36.154
(Marella)
Well, you haven't
answered my question.

44:36.229 --> 44:37.218
(Marella)
Thank you.

44:38.064 --> 44:39.429
Excuse me.

44:40.266 --> 44:43.064
Well, in the beginning,
Michael was

44:43.136 --> 44:45.627
a bit of a womanizer.

44:45.705 --> 44:46.763
(Archangel)
What?

44:46.840 --> 44:48.705
[laughing]

44:48.775 --> 44:50.868
(Marella)
Do you, uh...
Have you made any plans?

44:50.944 --> 44:54.402
(Marella)
Now that you're back
in the United States...

45:29.282 --> 45:31.443
(Hawke)
Kind of pretty, huh?

45:31.918 --> 45:35.319
lt is not so beautiful

45:36.322 --> 45:37.687
as Russia.

45:39.526 --> 45:40.720
Yeah. From what l saw,

45:40.794 --> 45:43.160
that was a really
beautiful country.

45:43.229 --> 45:45.857
Not commercial
like United States.

45:46.099 --> 45:47.896
[birds chirping]

45:47.967 --> 45:49.901
l guess
you'll be going back.

45:49.969 --> 45:51.402
Of course.

45:53.273 --> 45:56.242
Just as soon
as Mama and Papa...

45:58.044 --> 46:02.140
l will never give up Russia.
Never.

46:03.149 --> 46:05.447
Nobody is
asking you to, Tanya.

46:07.654 --> 46:10.316
You can't give up
what's in your heart.

46:10.390 --> 46:13.587
You mean l will not be forced
to become American?

46:13.727 --> 46:14.955
Well,

46:16.863 --> 46:19.957
l'm sure
there'll be a lot of people
who'll try to Americanize you.

46:20.033 --> 46:21.557
That's only natural.

46:21.634 --> 46:22.293
(Hawke)
You might even find out

46:22.335 --> 46:25.031
some things about this country
you like.

46:25.105 --> 46:26.231
Like what?

46:26.306 --> 46:27.864
l don't know.

46:28.341 --> 46:31.777
Music, books,
films, fast food.

46:32.212 --> 46:35.147
[bird chirping]

46:35.348 --> 46:38.442
But most of all,
the freedom
to accept or reject

46:38.518 --> 46:41.316
our culture or our politics
as you see fit.
