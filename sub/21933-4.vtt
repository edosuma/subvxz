00:03.437 --> 00:06.640
Good morning, Dad.
Chale has some news.

00:06.707 --> 00:07.775
It's quite exciting.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.777
I think you're gonna
like it, Mr. Gable.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.879
Okay, please, chill.
Look, you're married
to my daughter now.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.614
You can call me Kevin. Okay?

00:13.681 --> 00:17.118
Really? Wow.
Okay, uh, Kevin, um,
I have some news...

00:17.185 --> 00:19.353
All right, never mind.
I don't, I don't like it.
It's very weird.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.255
You gotta go back.
You gotta go back.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.990
Fine. Uh, Mr. Gable,

00:23.057 --> 00:27.561
you are looking at Enzo's
newest food server.
(CHUCKLES)

00:27.628 --> 00:30.498
Right. Oh, you got a job.
I... That's, uh, great.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.600
I don't, I don't know
how exciting it is.
(CHUCKLES)

00:32.666 --> 00:35.636
The excitement comes
in three waves.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.671
One, I will have money
for rent.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.240
I can ride that wave.

00:39.307 --> 00:41.942
Two, I will be able
to bring home
all the leftover pizza.

00:42.009 --> 00:43.877
-Uh-huh.
-And three,

00:43.944 --> 00:49.083
I will be able to save you
a seat at the bar
for all sporting events.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.752
I gotta say, I thought
this was gonna take
a bad turn. (CHUCKLES)

00:51.819 --> 00:53.354
(CHUCKLES) Plus we can
hang out more.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.223
There it is.
Right there.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.828
Good morning, neighbor.
Drink this.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.363
I'm good.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.498
No, you gotta drink this.
It's coffee from Holland.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.066
Yeah, I already had coffee.

01:06.134 --> 01:08.802
Ah, not like this.
This goes down
smooth, silky.

01:08.869 --> 01:11.705
It's like a Sunday walk
in a pair of furry boots.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.944
And then it hits
the bloodstream,

01:17.010 --> 01:19.380
and it's like a llama
stomping you in a field.

01:22.250 --> 01:25.453
By the way, I'm so excited
about the new job.
Thank you so much.

01:25.519 --> 01:26.987
But remember,
you're not licensed,

01:27.054 --> 01:28.822
so you can't do
any security work,
all right?

01:28.889 --> 01:30.758
Got it. Wink-wink.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.027
No, no,
there's no winks,
all right?

01:34.094 --> 01:35.396
You're like an intern,
all right?

01:35.463 --> 01:37.365
It's low pay, all right?
It's no benefits...

01:37.431 --> 01:40.168
Why is my heart pounding
out of rhythm?

01:40.234 --> 01:42.536
It's the llama. (GRUNTS)

01:44.472 --> 01:49.143
* I am not your
ordinary guy *

01:50.178 --> 01:51.812
So, uh, what do I do?

01:51.879 --> 01:54.515
I don't know. Uh, just...
I guess, answer the phone.

01:54.582 --> 01:55.949
Is there a manual
or something

01:56.016 --> 01:57.551
so I can read about
my work responsibilities?

01:57.618 --> 01:59.587
Okay. There's...
There's no manual.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.022
You know what?
That's a good idea,
write a manual.

02:02.089 --> 02:03.924
Oh, okay, yeah.

02:03.991 --> 02:07.761
I'll, uh, cover everything
from sexual harassment
to casual Fridays.

02:09.197 --> 02:11.098
Wow, so this is
your office. It's nice.

02:11.165 --> 02:14.235
Yes. Thank you.
Guys, this is Trent.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.270
Trent, this is
my partner, Kevin.

02:16.337 --> 02:17.705
Hey.
Trent. Nice to meet ya.

02:17.771 --> 02:18.772
Trent. That's a, uh...

02:18.839 --> 02:20.474
That's like a soap opera
name, right?

02:20.541 --> 02:21.809
(AS TELENOVELA ACTORS)
"Who was the last to see

02:21.875 --> 02:23.744
"Maria alive?"

02:24.812 --> 02:26.580
"I think it was Trent."

02:27.881 --> 02:29.250
Okay, good bit.
Yeah.

02:29.317 --> 02:32.520
And, uh, this is Rootger,
he manages...

02:32.586 --> 02:34.588
Let's go with
human resources.

02:36.089 --> 02:37.425
All right, so thank you.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.726
Thank you for walking me
back to the office.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.728
Wow, there's a lot of
big dudes here.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.696
Kevin looks like he belongs
in the NFL.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.100
I mean, I don't know
about the NFL,

02:47.167 --> 02:48.802
but I certainly had some
good moments in high school.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.504
Yeah, I bet you did.
I can tell by the frame.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.139
You never quite lose it.

02:52.206 --> 02:55.075
You know, you really don't.
You don't ever really lose it.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.744
Trent, you want
a cup of coffee?

02:56.810 --> 02:58.612
No, he's gotta get back
to the office.
He's a doctor.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.448
Uh, dermatologist.
No big deal.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.815
Hey, it was great
meeting you guys.

03:01.882 --> 03:04.218
And, uh,
I'll call you later.
Okay.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.122
Ooh! Someone has
a boyfriend.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.392
Ooh! Someone has a boyfriend.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.996
Shut up.
He is not my boyfriend.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.931
Look, I like Trent,
but he's getting the hook.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.634
I can't get emotionally
involved with somebody
right now.

03:24.672 --> 03:27.308
Oh, boy. Here we go.
What?

03:27.375 --> 03:29.042
(SCOFFS) Every jerk you date,

03:29.109 --> 03:31.144
you fall in love with,
and you end up getting hurt.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.381
You finally meet
a rock-solid guy

03:33.447 --> 03:34.948
and you're getting set
to run away?

03:35.015 --> 03:36.617
(CHUCKLES) Rock-solid?

03:36.684 --> 03:38.352
Okay, you're only saying that

03:38.419 --> 03:41.121
because Trent said
you look like you played
in the NFL.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.356
Uh, no. I mean, no, no...

03:42.423 --> 03:43.924
It was nice.
It was very nice.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.859
I usually get college,
I don't get the NFL too often.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.261
Did you hear what he said
about the frame, though?

03:47.328 --> 03:49.263
Frame stays where it is.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.498
No, what I'm saying is,

03:50.564 --> 03:51.632
look, you know
how I have, like,

03:51.699 --> 03:54.067
a supernatural
sense for things.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.168
No, you don't.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.537
Yes, I do.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.506
(STUTTERS) Two things
people always ask me about.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.974
Relationships and where to
eat late at night.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.042
It's my gift.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.011
Okay, look,
Trent is a nice guy,

04:04.077 --> 04:05.913
but I'm just not ready
for a relationship.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.715
It doesn't matter
if you're ready, okay?

04:07.781 --> 04:09.550
Love doesn't have
a clock. All right?

04:09.617 --> 04:10.951
I don't have time for this.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.686
Okay, you know what I think
you should do, honestly?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.322
Invite Trent to
your sister's wedding.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.423
No.
Yes.

04:15.489 --> 04:16.757
That is way too big a step!

04:16.824 --> 04:20.694
Or not big enough?
Hey. Open your heart.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.331
Hey, guys. Uh, question
on the company's manual.

04:23.397 --> 04:26.367
Do we need a policy
on maternity leave?

04:26.434 --> 04:27.968
Or has that ship sailed?

04:32.606 --> 04:34.575
Hi, I'm picking up
an order.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.510
Wait, Kendra Gable?

04:36.577 --> 04:38.346
Noreen Thompson?
(CHUCKLES)

04:38.412 --> 04:40.113
Wow. I haven't
seen you since...

04:40.180 --> 04:42.015
High-school graduation.

04:42.082 --> 04:46.186
I was on my way to Harvard,
and you were going to, um...

04:46.253 --> 04:47.788
SUNY Plattsburgh.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.359
Right.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.594
But I'm in
Columbia Law School now.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.329
Yeah. This job
is just part-time.

04:55.396 --> 04:58.766
Good for you.
By the way, it's
Noreen Thompson-Brady now.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.234
Yeah. I'm married too,
by the way.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.804
Kendra Gable-Witt.

05:03.871 --> 05:07.240
Fantastic. Rick runs
his own hedge fund.
What's your hubby do?

05:07.307 --> 05:10.210
He's a
software developer, yeah.

05:10.277 --> 05:11.745
And a game designer.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.014
Yeah, he's just kind of
an all-around, like,
tech genius.

05:14.081 --> 05:17.718
I keep leaning
against the pizza oven
and burning my shoulder.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.354
I tell myself,
"Don't do it,"

05:20.421 --> 05:22.790
but apparently,
that's not enough.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.327
I'm Chale.

05:27.395 --> 05:31.264
Oh. This is my friend Noreen.
This is my husband Chale.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.500
Nice to meet you.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.402
Oh, you're from England.
(CHUCKLES)

05:34.468 --> 05:37.905
We honeymooned there,
and then jetted over to
the south of France.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.641
Us, too. (CHUCKLES)

05:40.708 --> 05:44.645
Yeah, uh, what...
We did London and Paris,

05:44.712 --> 05:47.515
and then... Hawaii.

05:49.116 --> 05:52.686
Wow. Weird, I didn't see
any of your posts
on Instagram.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.922
Oh, yeah,
I've just been so busy.
(CHUCKLES)

05:54.988 --> 05:56.924
But I'm gonna post them.
This week.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.793
I'll be looking for it.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.962
Great seeing you.
You, too.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.063
(CHUCKLES)

06:06.199 --> 06:08.035
So why were you lyi...

06:08.101 --> 06:10.771
It's a pizza oven, guy!
It's always hot!

06:12.640 --> 06:15.409
That would be great.
Several months of work?

06:15.476 --> 06:16.844
Yes, I'm sure
they'd be interested.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.079
That's a very
generous offer.

06:19.146 --> 06:22.182
They'll be happy to hear it.
Thank you.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.284
That sounded amazing.
We got another job?

06:24.351 --> 06:27.521
Oh, no, no.
I was just testing out
my new headset.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.558
Good morning.
ROOTGER: Morning.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.560
I got my boys some donuts.

06:32.626 --> 06:35.563
Ooh! I like the powdery ones.
They get on my face.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.068
Hey. You look good
in that shirt.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.070
What?

06:43.136 --> 06:45.906
You look good.
In the shirt.
You look good.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.178
Somebody's in a good mood.

06:51.244 --> 06:55.148
Well, I had
a really nice time
with Trent last night.

06:55.215 --> 06:57.685
I let down my guard,
and it actually worked.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.020
I am taking him
to my sister's wedding.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.622
Oh, are you?

07:02.756 --> 07:04.291
I got a
"you're welcome" ready,

07:04.357 --> 07:08.361
if you wanna throw me
a "thank you".
(CHUCKLING)

07:08.428 --> 07:11.164
Let's not get
too cocky, all right?
You got lucky.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.767
Okay, first of all,
there's no such thing as luck.
There's only truth.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.268
Oh, really?
There's only truth?
You want some truth?

07:15.335 --> 07:16.336
Yeah. Yeah.

07:16.403 --> 07:17.705
Okay. T-shirt.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.607
Yeah.
Little snug, buddy.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.213
What's this?
You ordered without me?

07:26.279 --> 07:30.317
Unspoken rule, guy.
Come on, you always wait.

07:30.383 --> 07:31.885
Hey, I love ya, guy.

07:31.952 --> 07:35.523
But when we say 4:30
and 4:37 rolls around,

07:35.589 --> 07:37.591
I'm getting into some wings.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.459
But, hey, you can order
some beers if you want.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.328
Oh, am I allowed
to do that? Yeah?

07:41.394 --> 07:43.597
Don't be like that, dawg.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.098
Look at that, it's Trent.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.134
Who's that?
Vanessa's new boyfriend.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.437
Good dude. He said
I look like I could play
in the NFL. So...

07:50.504 --> 07:52.873
So he's delusional?

07:52.940 --> 07:55.042
No, no, no.
He's a good guy, man.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.945
Vanessa was gonna dump him,
but I sprinkled
a little wisdom on it

07:58.011 --> 08:00.313
and I got her back
on the right track, so...

08:00.380 --> 08:02.983
Wow. Vanessa looks different.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.184
What's that?

08:07.420 --> 08:08.989
That's not good.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.327
KEVIN: Look, there's
no easy way of saying this.

08:14.394 --> 08:17.497
I saw Trent kissing
another woman, all right?

08:17.565 --> 08:20.200
I... I know it hurts,
all right?

08:20.267 --> 08:23.070
But I have to be honest.
'Cause I'm
a straight-shooter.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.539
It's just who I am.
I've always been that way.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.811
It feels like you made
the end part all about you.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.714
Guys.

08:34.548 --> 08:35.583
Great, now I gotta wing it.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.551
Hey, always remember...

08:38.786 --> 08:40.087
Always remember what?

08:40.621 --> 08:41.989
Ah, I lost it.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.357
You, uh... You got a sec?

08:44.424 --> 08:46.594
Yeah. Oh, big news.

08:46.660 --> 08:49.229
You know how my dad's
always giving me crap
about the guys that I date?

08:49.296 --> 08:51.464
Well, when I told him
that I am bringing

08:51.531 --> 08:53.266
my doctor boyfriend
to the wedding,

08:53.333 --> 08:55.302
he had nothing to say.

08:55.368 --> 08:59.707
Hmm. You know...
You know I'm kind of
doubling back now.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.709
Um, I don't know,

09:01.775 --> 09:04.477
maybe taking Trent
to the wedding
is a little too soon.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.813
You have a habit
of doing that.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.014
You know, you rush
into things, kind of.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.548
What? What are you
talking about?

09:08.616 --> 09:10.117
What about the
"love has no clock" thing?

09:10.183 --> 09:11.752
Well, that's another
bad habit of yours,

09:11.819 --> 09:13.587
you take things literally.

09:13.654 --> 09:17.524
Oh, my God.
Oh, and the best news! Okay.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.359
Trent teaches salsa dancing,

09:19.426 --> 09:22.996
and my dad
and his third wife think
they're such great dancers.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.499
We are gonna smoke them
on the dance floor.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.301
Smoke 'em?
Yeah.

09:28.368 --> 09:29.870
(STUTTERS) I gotta tell you,
that sounds
a little revenge-y.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.973
It's not a...
Not a good look on you.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.142
Okay, it's a great look
on me.

09:35.208 --> 09:38.511
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some dance shoes
to buy online.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.013
(SIGHS)

09:42.282 --> 09:45.018
All right, guys,
feel that warm
Hawaiian breeze,

09:45.085 --> 09:46.887
and give me
a hearty "mahalo", too.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.623
Mahalo.
Oh. Mahalo.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.492
Guys, this...
This is ridiculous.

09:52.559 --> 09:53.761
Why are we even
doing this?

09:53.827 --> 09:55.328
This? We are creating
a honeymoon

09:55.395 --> 09:56.964
through the magic
of digital editing.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.632
Yes.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.801
And then we post it
on Instagram and stick it
in Noreen's face.

10:00.868 --> 10:01.902
That's what
I'm talking about.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.571
What's with this guy?

10:04.638 --> 10:06.439
Plus, we didn't have
a real honeymoon,

10:06.506 --> 10:07.975
so this is
the next best thing.

10:08.041 --> 10:11.144
But it's not. It's fake.
This... It's ridiculous.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.946
Oh, really? Okay.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.448
Well, look at this.
My dating profile.

10:15.515 --> 10:17.617
I've been
all over the world.

10:17.685 --> 10:20.654
This is me
in Buckingham Palace.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.423
Wow.
Mmm-hmm.

10:23.490 --> 10:26.694
And I took a couple of laps
in the Tour de France.

10:29.062 --> 10:32.332
Yeah. Yeah.
That actually looks good.
Great.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.067
All right, so what's up?
Fill me in.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.236
Just, uh...
Just a little surveillance,
you know?

10:36.303 --> 10:38.471
Got the call this morning,
so let's do this.

10:38.538 --> 10:41.441
You know what?
I think Trent lives
around here.

10:41.508 --> 10:44.678
Hmm. Well,
that's kind of weird.

10:44.745 --> 10:48.348
And the people
that hired us,
the Favre Corporation?

10:48.415 --> 10:51.151
That's funny. (CHUCKLES)
Like Brett Favre,
the football player?

10:51.218 --> 10:53.353
I guess. You know,
it's, uh...

10:53.420 --> 10:55.522
Didn't think about it.
It's a pretty...

10:55.588 --> 10:58.491
Pretty common name. Favre.

10:58.558 --> 11:01.628
Is it? How many...
How many Favres
do you know?

11:01.695 --> 11:03.530
Are you kidding me?

11:03.596 --> 11:07.400
There's Chuck Favre.
Uh, I played Little League
with a Frank Favre.

11:07.467 --> 11:11.604
And, uh, second grade,
I had a wicked crush
on, uh, Sally Favre.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.707
Okay, stop saying Favre.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.608
So wha...
What's the gig exactly?

11:15.675 --> 11:17.811
Uh, I don't know.
We're just supposed to
watch this guy and see...

11:17.878 --> 11:19.579
Oh, look at this.
We got some movement.

11:19.646 --> 11:24.752
Okay. Got a female,
mid-thirties, blonde
and a... Man.

11:24.818 --> 11:27.721
Hmm. That's Trent.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.058
(ACTING SURPRISED) What...

11:34.427 --> 11:36.263
Okay, what's going on?

11:36.329 --> 11:38.866
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
I wanted to tell you,
all right?

11:38.932 --> 11:41.268
I saw him last night
with that girl at Enzo's.

11:41.334 --> 11:44.337
So maybe it's his sister
or something.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.139
(SIGHS)

11:46.206 --> 11:47.975
Okay. Not his sister.
Not his sister.

11:53.881 --> 11:57.751
Hey, is, uh,
Vanessa here?
Yeah. In her office.

11:57.818 --> 12:01.121
The mood is not good today.
No, no donuts.

12:02.689 --> 12:04.758
I'm a little bit frightened.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.760
Oh, boy.

12:07.928 --> 12:11.031
Hey, did you, uh...
did you get my texts?

12:11.098 --> 12:13.600
Yeah, I got all 20 of them.
I get it, you're sorry.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.936
I also got
your sad-face emojis.

12:16.003 --> 12:19.072
I bought the app,
they're unlimited.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.942
Did you get the one
with the smiling poop?

12:24.577 --> 12:26.079
Got the smiling poop.

12:26.146 --> 12:29.016
I was looking for a sad poop,
but they didn't have it.

12:31.819 --> 12:36.990
They, uh, They just...
They just don't make it.
They don't make it.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.292
If you don't mind,
I have a wedding to get to,

12:39.359 --> 12:42.262
where I'm gonna be ridiculed.
So, thank you.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.931
Oh, come on, it's...
It's gonna be fine.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.899
No, you don't know
my dad.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.535
Nothing I do
is ever good enough.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.471
I show up to the wedding
without this guy

12:51.538 --> 12:53.106
that I've been going
on and on about,

12:53.173 --> 12:54.707
he's gonna have a field day.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.545
"Oh, Vanessa lost
another one. Ha.
Single again."

12:59.746 --> 13:01.314
Maybe not.
I don't think...

13:01.381 --> 13:03.783
Maybe he'll see it
as a sign of strength,
you know?

13:03.851 --> 13:05.886
He's probably gonna
respect you for it.

13:08.421 --> 13:12.425
It warms my heart
to see my baby girl
so happy.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.526
And Vanessa, too.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.562
She met herself
a nice doctor.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.897
So I hear.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.132
(GUESTS CHUCKLING)

13:19.199 --> 13:21.234
I'm only kidding, sweetheart.
You know I love you.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.803
In fact, I can't wait
for your wedding day.

13:23.871 --> 13:27.507
I think I can live
to be 100, 125.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.778
What do you think, Tony?

13:31.845 --> 13:33.446
You can do it, Pops.
(CHUCKLES)

13:33.513 --> 13:38.618
(CHUCKLES) To Stephanie
and Tony, my best.
Cento anni.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.087
ALL: Cento anni.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.857
You know it's...
It's all in fun, right?

13:43.924 --> 13:45.158
Yeah. No, I know, Dad.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.326
I'm sorry about the guy
that couldn't make it.

13:46.393 --> 13:47.961
You know,
but you gotta learn,

13:48.028 --> 13:49.496
when you get attracted
to these type of guys...

13:49.562 --> 13:51.899
Oh, hey, I'm sorry I am late.
Uh, traffic was crazy.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.833
Hi. I'm Trent.
Nice to meet you.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.703
Vincent Cellucci.
So, uh, you're the doctor
I've been hearing about.

13:56.769 --> 14:02.275
Well, dermatologist.
I, uh, specialize in moles.
(CHUCKLES)

14:02.342 --> 14:04.177
But those moles,
they bought me a boat.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.679
I call it the SS Skin-tag.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.015
(CHUCKLING) That's funny.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.782
It's just dermo humor,
you know?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.351
Okay, this is ridiculous.

14:11.418 --> 14:12.852
Uh, I'm not doing this.
No. Dad...
(MUSIC PLAYING)

14:12.920 --> 14:14.254
That's my song.

14:14.321 --> 14:18.558
Katarina, get those legs
over here. It's salsa time!

14:27.234 --> 14:28.601
What are you doing here?

14:28.668 --> 14:30.237
I'm helping you out.
Come on, let's tear it up.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.639
No. God. (STUTTERS)
You don't dance salsa.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.975
I just learned for four hours
on YouTube, okay?

14:35.042 --> 14:37.244
Believe me. Caliente.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.924
Ooh! Don't overdo it, slick.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.644
Ooh.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.027
Huh! Look at those two.

15:31.698 --> 15:32.966
They're dipping.
Everybody's dipping.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.301
Don't do it. Don't do it.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.402
We gotta dip.
I don't want you to do it.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.636
Trust me.
I do not trust you.

15:36.703 --> 15:37.837
(BOTH ARGUING)

15:37.904 --> 15:39.306
Hey, look at me.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.052
Wow. That looks great.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.489
And I was gonna do one
with me photobombing

15:56.556 --> 15:58.091
and I was treading water
next to you,

15:58.158 --> 16:01.061
but I just looked like
a piece of driftwood.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.862
Oh, look, we're already
racking up likes.

16:02.929 --> 16:04.331
Oh, and one's from Noreen.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.766
"Love the pics.
Amazing honeymoon!"

16:06.833 --> 16:10.237
Oh, she is hating this.
We beat Noreen Thompson!

16:10.303 --> 16:13.973
But we didn't actually go
on an amazing honeymoon.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.143
So isn't this kind of
a hollow victory?

16:16.209 --> 16:20.013
Not hollow. It's mahalo .
(CHUCKLES)

16:20.080 --> 16:23.116
Ah, Polynesian humor.
My favorite.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.617
Oh, look,
we got another like.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.087
Who's Amelia Chamberlain?

16:27.154 --> 16:29.356
Amelia Chamberlain?

16:29.422 --> 16:31.558
We went
to university together.

16:31.624 --> 16:32.692
She dumped me the...

16:32.759 --> 16:35.495
After I bought her
all of her textbooks.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.899
She's liking our photos.
Oh, here we go.

16:39.966 --> 16:44.704
"Looking good, Chale." Aw.
Yeah, take that, slag!

16:44.771 --> 16:46.373
(CHUCKLES)

16:47.807 --> 16:49.309
You know, in some cultures,

16:49.376 --> 16:51.378
it's considered good luck
for the sister of the bride

16:51.444 --> 16:54.013
to spill a little blood
on the dance floor.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.782
How's it looking
back there?

16:55.848 --> 16:57.850
It's not that bad,
I gotta tell you.
I mean, I wouldn't...

16:57.917 --> 17:00.653
I wouldn't take a nap
for a while, but, uh...

17:00.720 --> 17:02.722
I'm sorry, okay? I tried.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.891
It's just your center
of gravity, it just, like...
It was...

17:04.957 --> 17:06.059
It's a lot lower
than you think.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.460
Is it? Okay.
Yeah.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.463
So just to recap.
I don't have a boyfriend.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.632
I made a fool of myself
at the wedding,

17:12.699 --> 17:15.168
which is on video,
by the way.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.903
I might need stitches.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.438
And I have to listen
to my dad tell me

17:18.505 --> 17:20.140
I'm gonna be alone
the rest of my life.

17:20.207 --> 17:23.743
You're tracking things
real well,
which is a good sign.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.279
Okay. Well, your work
is done here.

17:34.421 --> 17:37.590
Don't feel
too bad. (SIGHS)

17:37.657 --> 17:40.327
It's not your fault.
It never works out
with Vanessa.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.494
Yeah, I guess not.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.163
(CHUCKLES)
You wanna know why?

17:43.230 --> 17:44.731
You can't rely on her.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.367
And I'm not just talking
about dating either.

17:47.434 --> 17:50.570
Look, I have
a very successful business.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.372
Very successful.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.542
I wanted my daughters
to take over.

17:55.608 --> 17:59.346
Stephanie over there,
she's my CFO,
she's killing it.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.249
Vanessa, she turned me down.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.384
(SIGHS) It was like
a gut punch.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.188
Take my advice, Trent,
you're better off.

18:08.255 --> 18:12.525
Vanessa seems like
a great catch,
but she's unreliable.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.829
(CHUCKLING) Unreliable?
I'm... I'm sorry.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.531
I gotta
respectfully disagree.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.268
I mean, she was a cop
for 20 years.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.270
And word on the street was,
she was real good.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.472
I heard her partner
was, like, super-human.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.540
I think his name
was Kevin, I'm not sure.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.709
I heard he could've played
in the NFL, possibly.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.344
But the point is,

18:31.411 --> 18:34.981
if I had to pick one person
to rely on in this world,
it would be Vanessa.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.917
Yeah. I mean...
And you know
what the sad thing is?

18:37.984 --> 18:39.252
What?

18:39.319 --> 18:40.853
That you don't know that.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.456
(SIGHS) Oh, boy.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.794
What was that about?

18:48.828 --> 18:50.430
That Trent guy?

18:50.497 --> 18:53.566
You finally picked
a good one.
What?

18:53.633 --> 18:56.169
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
That's a good man.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.773
I'm happy
for you, sweetheart.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.418
What are you doing?

19:11.484 --> 19:12.719
Uh. I was just, uh,
grabbing a strawberry,

19:12.785 --> 19:15.322
and then I saw
the chocolate thing

19:15.388 --> 19:18.157
and I was, like,
"That's interesting."

19:20.660 --> 19:23.296
So, what did you say
to my dad?

19:23.363 --> 19:25.198
Nothing. It was just...
It was guy talk.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.467
Did you really watch
four hours of video

19:27.534 --> 19:29.068
learning how to
salsa dance for me?

19:29.135 --> 19:32.004
Listen, I clicked
on a squirrel
on a skateboard

19:32.071 --> 19:36.709
and that led me
to salsa dancing.
That's all it was.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.478
Thank you.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.580
Well, hey,
that's what friends do.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.615
Yeah.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.984
You know
what else friends do?
Get paper towels.

19:45.051 --> 19:48.721
'Cause I'm kinda
bleeding down
my back right now.

19:49.589 --> 19:52.225
Okay, uh, it's just...

19:52.292 --> 19:56.162
They said they're taking
this away in 10 minutes
and, uh...

19:56.229 --> 19:59.666
Once it's gone, it's go...
All right, fine. Fine.
Now. I don't believe it.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.247
(MOUTHING)

20:16.316 --> 20:17.517
Come here.

20:19.185 --> 20:20.787
(GRUNTS)

20:26.125 --> 20:29.262
* Don't want no sweet perfume

20:29.329 --> 20:32.865
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move

20:32.932 --> 20:35.201
* Do, do, do, do, do

20:35.268 --> 20:36.269
* Do, do, do, do

20:36.336 --> 20:40.172
