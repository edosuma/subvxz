WHAT THE NOISE WAS.

01:08.067 --> 01:08.985
YOU'RE ALL QUITE SAFE.

HE MUMMIFIES ME.

WHY DON'T WE JUST GIVE THE PIECE

WE'RE IN A STRONGER POSITION

IN THE BUD.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.685

- THE ELIXIR,
POSSIBLY THE ANKH PIECES.

THE ANKH PIECES.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.787
YOU MIGHT BE IN THE WRONG JOB,
VICTOR?

04:47.870 --> 04:50.707

THEY HAVE THE ANKH PIECES

04:50.790 --> 04:52.166
OR IF THEY KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

04:52.250 --> 04:52.834

WITH RUFUS?

04:52.917 --> 04:54.711

04:56.087 --> 04:57.380

NO.

07:41.752 --> 07:44.338
HE'S...NOT INTERESTED.

07:44.422 --> 07:47.049

07:47.133 --> 07:50.720
WHY DON'T YOU ASK FABIAN?

07:50.803 --> 07:51.429

07:51.512 --> 07:55.766
- UM, IF IT'S TRUE,

07:55.850 --> 07:57.560
YOU PLUCK YOUR EYEBROWS.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.937
THEY'RE SUPER SHAPELY.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.150
[whispers]
JUST ASK HIM.

08:04.233 --> 08:09.322

YOU MAKE NO SENSE.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.657
OH, LOOK, HERE'S JEROME.
HEY, JEROME.

08:11.741 --> 08:12.658

08:12.742 --> 08:14.410
- GREAT TO SEE YOU.

08:14.493 --> 08:16.913
SO HOW'D YOU GET ON?

08:16.996 --> 08:17.997
- OH, WELL, HE STILL TRUSTS ME.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.249
- I TOLD YOU.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.377
- AND HE HAS TOLD ME MORE STUFF
ABOUT THE CUP.

08:23.461 --> 08:26.297
- OKAY, GUYS, CAN WE GATHER
AROUND IN A CIRCLE, PLEASE

08:26.380 --> 08:28.633
AND WE'LL DO
SOME VOCAL WARM-UPS.

08:28.716 --> 08:31.510
MA, ME, MI, MO, MU.

08:31.594 --> 08:35.890
- RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT.
RIGHT, LEFT--

08:35.972 --> 08:36.599
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M DOING.

08:36.682 --> 08:39.477
- RIGHT, LEFT, TWIST.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.437
OW, MICK!
- I'M SORRY.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.563
- NO, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO TWIST ME UNDER YOUR ARM.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.233
YOU'RE THE MAN HERE,
SUPPOSEDLY.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.193
- I CAN'T DO IT.

08:47.276 --> 08:50.404
- YOU'VE IMPROVED,
AT LEAST 2%.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.282

09:00.248 --> 09:03.125
"LOOKING FORWARD TO SHARING
THE STAGE WITH YOU AGAIN,

09:03.209 --> 09:05.753
"THIS TIME,
AS PROM KING AND QUEEN.

INSTANT ALPHA COUPLE."

09:07.046 --> 09:08.965
[squeals]

09:09.048 --> 09:11.175
THIS IS A BIG CLUE.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.762
AND LUCKILY, I'VE BECOME
VERY CLUE-Y LATELY.

09:14.845 --> 09:18.307
SO WHO'D I SHARE THE STAGE WITH
IN THE PLAY?

09:18.391 --> 09:20.643
- WELL, ALL OF THE BOYS
AT SOME POINT.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.980
AND MR. SWEET
WHEN WE TOOK OUR BOW.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.106
- EW-UH.

- MAYBE IT'S THAT MAN
IN THE BLACK,

09:27.316 --> 09:29.443
YOU KNOW, THAT MRS. ANDREWS
CHASED OFF STAGE AT THE END.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.028
- NO, DON'T EVEN JOKE.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.781
- OKAY.

09:33.864 --> 09:36.325
- STILL THINK WE WOULD HAVE BEEN
SAFER GOING TO THE WOODS

09:36.409 --> 09:39.245
OR THE BIKE SHED,
MAYBE EVEN THE SHARK TANK.

09:39.328 --> 09:40.663
- IT'S ALMOST DARK OUT.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.748
WHAT IF RUFUS IS SNEAKING AROUND
OUT THERE?

09:42.832 --> 09:43.916
- WHAT ABOUT JEROME?

09:44.000 --> 09:44.959
SHOULDN'T WE INVOLVE HIM
IN THIS TOO?

09:45.042 --> 09:46.669
- WELL, HE WAS TRYING
TO BLACKMAIL US.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.547
- TRUE, BUT THE MORE INVOLVED
JEROME FEELS,
