00:01.167 --> 00:03.169
<i>Previously, on "Being Mary Jane..."</i>

00:03.236 --> 00:07.741
<i>We're going to keep this a secret
from everyone.</i>

00:07.807 --> 00:09.943
We're kind of on shaky ground at work...

00:10.009 --> 00:11.277
So, we wait.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.813
- What are you doing?
- I'm changing my search to New York.

00:14.147 --> 00:16.783
Having a long-distance relationship
with some New York negro

00:16.850 --> 00:18.485
won't feed your kids.

00:18.551 --> 00:20.553
Something is up.

00:21.121 --> 00:22.956
Sorry I haven't been able
to get more out of her.

00:23.289 --> 00:24.424
You could go visit her.

00:24.491 --> 00:26.059
No, I can't do New York.

00:26.126 --> 00:27.894
But you could, Niecy.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.330
It's so great to have you back!

00:30.397 --> 00:32.866
I'm still in shock.
Not only do I have my job back,

00:33.400 --> 00:35.668
Garrett bumped me to senior producer.

00:35.735 --> 00:37.670
I don't know what you did, but, my God...

00:37.737 --> 00:39.172
No, I didn't...

00:40.073 --> 00:42.275
Just accept my thanks already,
please, okay?

00:46.312 --> 00:48.448
<i>You were willing
to share your title with her.</i>

00:49.549 --> 00:51.251
<i>I thought that meant so much to you.</i>

01:08.668 --> 01:10.570
Emergency meeting. Let's go.

01:13.006 --> 01:14.541
After you two.

01:16.142 --> 01:17.343
Kara...

01:23.817 --> 01:25.018
Justin, you look tired.

01:25.084 --> 01:26.119
Late night?

01:31.291 --> 01:32.492
Kara!

01:32.959 --> 01:35.161
Our main goal
is to reverse the ratings slide

01:35.228 --> 01:38.531
the show experienced
during the somewhat bumpy transition

01:38.598 --> 01:41.067
from Ronda to the lovely Mary Jane here.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.137
Our numbers still aren't
where we would want them to be,

01:44.204 --> 01:48.208
but when you look at the demos,
there are some promising trends.

01:48.775 --> 01:52.145
With that said,
I'd like to formally welcome

01:52.579 --> 01:55.582
"Great Day USA's" newest correspondent,
Dani Hollins.

01:58.184 --> 01:59.719
Dani, anything you'd like to add?

01:59.786 --> 02:02.555
Just how wonderfully excited I am
to be here.

02:02.622 --> 02:06.159
I mean, last week, I was making
YouTube videos off of my iPhone,

02:06.226 --> 02:07.694
and look at me now!

02:07.760 --> 02:09.929
- Miracles really do happen.
- Yeah.

02:09.996 --> 02:12.565
Anyway, I want to do a great job here

02:12.632 --> 02:14.667
and learn from each and every one of you.

02:18.972 --> 02:22.008
Today also marks the return
of producer Kara Lynch.

02:23.943 --> 02:25.712
Kara, we all make mistakes,

02:25.778 --> 02:28.581
but your work as producer
here at "GDU" was invaluable,

02:28.648 --> 02:31.551
and I, for one, I'm thrilled
to welcome you back into the fold.

02:31.951 --> 02:33.219
<i>You're screwing him!</i>

02:33.286 --> 02:35.388
- I wanted to tell you.
- Don't give me that crap.

02:35.455 --> 02:38.725
Because the fact that you didn't tell me
means that you knew you were wrong.

02:39.125 --> 02:42.028
You dumped Lee for that piece of shit,
snake in the grass

02:42.095 --> 02:43.396
who had me fired?

02:43.463 --> 02:45.899
Yeah, that snake
also got you your job back.

02:47.033 --> 02:48.535
Yeah, that was Justin, not me.

02:48.601 --> 02:50.103
That's because you told him to.

02:50.169 --> 02:51.538
What were you thinking?

02:51.604 --> 02:52.839
This is insanity.

02:52.906 --> 02:56.209
Kara, we're trying to keep this quiet
at work.

02:57.143 --> 02:58.778
We just need a little more time

02:58.845 --> 03:01.915
to get on better footing
with Garrett, okay? Please.

03:01.981 --> 03:04.417
You know what?
It took me five minutes to figure it out.

03:04.484 --> 03:06.352
So, good luck with that one.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.422
Kara knows.

03:09.489 --> 03:11.791
We gotta make sure
that she keeps this under wraps.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.192
I've got Garrett's ear now.

03:13.259 --> 03:15.461
Any rumor about the two of us
could jeopardize that.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.164
- Kara wouldn't betray me.
- Can you be certain of that?

03:23.303 --> 03:24.270
It's Garrett.

03:25.438 --> 03:26.539
Conference room.

03:32.679 --> 03:33.780
Have a sit, you two.

03:36.449 --> 03:37.717
Excuse me.

03:38.217 --> 03:39.385
Emma.

03:41.354 --> 03:42.322
Hi, guys.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.826
So, we have a big problem.

03:48.294 --> 03:50.196
<i>We are all God's children,</i>

03:51.264 --> 03:53.266
<i>but I would be shirking my responsibility</i>

03:53.333 --> 03:57.070
<i>if I did not call out
this sin and perversion.</i>

03:57.604 --> 04:02.041
<i>If a man locks lips with another man
or, Heaven forbids, touches penis,</i>

04:02.108 --> 04:04.510
<i>you are going to Hell!</i>

04:06.412 --> 04:08.548
- Wow, isn't that...?
- Sandra Curtis.

04:08.615 --> 04:10.883
Television's premiere
home-decorating diva

04:10.950 --> 04:12.652
slated to appear on "GDU"

04:12.719 --> 04:14.954
to launch
the viewer home makeover contest.

04:15.388 --> 04:16.923
Yeah, the contest is huge.

04:16.990 --> 04:19.726
It's multiple segments
airing over four weeks.

04:19.792 --> 04:22.428
Exactly,
and because this is a delicate issue,

04:22.495 --> 04:26.265
I've invited Aaliyah
from PR and Brand Strategy.

04:26.332 --> 04:28.301
So, what do you all think?

04:28.368 --> 04:30.069
Should we disinvite Sandra Curtis?

04:30.136 --> 04:32.138
- Absolutely.
- I agree.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.307
She's toast. She's the new Paula Deen.

04:36.809 --> 04:38.111
Dani, you disagree?

04:38.177 --> 04:40.279
I do,
and not just because it's my segment.

04:40.613 --> 04:41.948
It's censorship.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.884
You're taking away this woman's right
to freedom of speech,

04:44.951 --> 04:46.152
freedom of religion.

04:46.219 --> 04:49.255
This fool is about to be
the next Martha Stewart mogul,

04:49.322 --> 04:51.190
and she's got nothing better to do

04:51.257 --> 04:54.227
than to rag on lesbians
and gays at her coffee klatch?

04:54.293 --> 04:56.796
If you're a Christian
and follow the Bible...

04:56.863 --> 04:59.666
If you're a Christian
who follows the teachings of the Bible,

04:59.732 --> 05:01.634
you shouldn't be judging anybody.

05:01.701 --> 05:03.169
Guys, it's too controversial.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.971
Controversy draws viewers,

05:05.405 --> 05:06.873
and she has a huge following.

05:07.373 --> 05:09.709
Could be a ratings bonanza.

05:09.776 --> 05:11.611
The only discussion we should be having

05:11.678 --> 05:13.980
is what are we going to replace
that contest with.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.314
The segment is gone.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.283
We can do better, okay?

05:17.350 --> 05:18.418
Right, Justin?

05:18.484 --> 05:19.919
Actually, I agree with Dani.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.088
I think we should have her on.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.058
If Trump's surprise victory
taught us anything,

05:25.124 --> 05:29.696
is that we can't squash the conversation
and ignore what's going on out there.

05:29.762 --> 05:31.831
Otherwise, we end up getting blindsided.

05:31.898 --> 05:34.100
- Yes.
- Fox News has done some vital reporting

05:34.167 --> 05:36.769
- on this subject.
- You don't really believe that, right?

05:36.836 --> 05:38.938
Chris Wallace and others have called out

05:39.005 --> 05:41.574
this administration's
disinformation campaign,

05:42.141 --> 05:43.943
and I think they deserve credit for that.

05:44.343 --> 05:45.578
Justin might be right.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.047
Many in America still agree with Sandra.

05:48.114 --> 05:51.451
Yeah, just like the church-going people
in your community, Mary Jane.

05:51.517 --> 05:54.320
I didn't realize you were an expert
on the Black community.

05:54.387 --> 05:57.890
Look, all due respect, Garrett,
this debate is lunacy.

05:57.957 --> 05:59.425
Aaliyah, what's your opinion?

05:59.492 --> 06:00.660
Will this hurt us?

06:01.794 --> 06:04.163
Her social media followers
are already defecting.

06:04.230 --> 06:06.699
Her network is this close to axing her.

06:06.766 --> 06:09.135
As the story grows,
it's only going to get worse.

06:09.202 --> 06:13.039
Having Sandra Curtis on "GDU"
would be a PR nightmare.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.607
I don't think it's worth the risk.

06:16.075 --> 06:18.911
Fine. She's axed, provisionally.

06:18.978 --> 06:21.147
We need to come up
with a replacement segment,

06:21.214 --> 06:22.682
something with legs.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.317
So, if you think you can,

06:24.383 --> 06:27.253
in Mary Jane's words, "do better",

06:27.620 --> 06:29.689
you have until the end of the day
to prove it.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.260
So, what happened to us
being a united front?

06:34.594 --> 06:35.828
That is the aim.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.798
But in practice,
it's going to be a bit tricky.

06:38.865 --> 06:41.000
Yes, now that I know you watch Fox News.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.770
Does that mean
I can't have "Fox and Friends" to yourDVR?

06:50.176 --> 06:52.645
- Just wait here, I'll go get Ms. Paul.
- Okay, thanks.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.553
Don't mind if I do.

07:08.060 --> 07:09.395
Auntie!

07:09.462 --> 07:10.897
I have to take a picture.

07:17.003 --> 07:19.038
- Niecy!
- Auntie!

07:19.105 --> 07:21.107
- Welcome!
- Hi!

07:21.941 --> 07:23.576
It's so good to see you.

07:24.544 --> 07:26.646
This is so cool.
Everything looks so different.

07:26.712 --> 07:29.849
I wish I could give you the full tour,
but we are in a crisis.

07:29.916 --> 07:32.285
It's cool.
I already checked everything out anyway.

07:32.351 --> 07:35.121
Good. I made arrangements
for you to see all the sights.

07:35.188 --> 07:38.291
Empire State building,
9/11 Memorial, the MOMA.

07:38.357 --> 07:40.026
- Even got you torch tickets.
- What?

07:40.092 --> 07:42.929
Yes, you get to walk around
the Statue of Liberty's torch.

07:42.995 --> 07:45.064
Most people have to wait a year
to get those.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.767
- God, that's too cool.
- Go, enjoy! Have a good time.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.902
- I'll see you tonight, right?
- Of course.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.470
- Okay.
- So glad you're here.

07:51.537 --> 07:53.372
I don't even know what to do first.

07:53.439 --> 07:55.241
All of it. Let me take your suitcase.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.776
- Alright.
- I got you.

07:56.843 --> 07:58.110
- Be careful.
- See you later.

08:03.749 --> 08:06.018
That is amazing. I owe you big time.

08:06.352 --> 08:07.854
Thank you. Okay, bye.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.056
Garrett.

08:11.057 --> 08:13.826
I found a replacement
for the Sandra Curtis story.

08:13.893 --> 08:15.461
Wow, you work quick. Who is it?

08:15.962 --> 08:17.163
James Bond.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.865
As in Daniel Craig, the actor?

08:18.931 --> 08:21.701
As in the new Bond girl,
Anastasia Petrov.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.170
Mary Jane. Did you hear this?

08:24.237 --> 08:27.673
Kara got a lead on the new Bond girl,
the Russian supermodel.

08:27.740 --> 08:29.175
An exclusive, actually.

08:29.508 --> 08:32.078
She just landed a lead role
in the next Spielberg movie,

08:32.144 --> 08:35.147
and she's starring opposite Will Smith
in his next blockbuster.

08:35.214 --> 08:37.283
Well, that's perfect. I mean, come on.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.685
You got James Bond,
Will Smith and Spielberg.

08:39.752 --> 08:41.554
Doesn't get any more A-list than that.

08:41.621 --> 08:42.722
I'm sorry.

08:42.788 --> 08:44.557
Are we really going to scrap a segment

08:44.624 --> 08:46.759
that could be a big piece
of social commentary

08:46.826 --> 08:49.095
for some Russian Amazon
no one's ever heard of?

08:49.161 --> 08:50.396
Look, that Russian chick

08:50.463 --> 08:53.065
is obviously the next
big Hollywood it girl

08:53.132 --> 08:55.167
and we got her first. I mean, I'm sorry.

08:55.234 --> 08:58.137
Correction: Kara got her first.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.805
I'm inclined to agree with you.

09:00.439 --> 09:02.808
Justin, do you want to weigh in on this?

09:05.044 --> 09:06.178
Weigh in on what?

09:06.245 --> 09:09.582
We're trying to decide between
Sandra Curtis and the new Bond girl.

09:12.551 --> 09:14.954
Look, the Bond girl
definitely has some heat.

09:15.354 --> 09:16.889
But I did hear that Diane Sawyer

09:16.956 --> 09:19.859
has been sniffing around
for an exclusive with Sandra Curtis.

09:19.926 --> 09:21.260
We have the jump,

09:21.327 --> 09:23.596
because we have her booked
for the makeover segment.

09:23.963 --> 09:27.133
I don't think we should be scared
of a little controversy.

09:28.601 --> 09:29.769
Then, the choice is obvious.

09:29.835 --> 09:30.870
We will move forward

09:30.937 --> 09:33.572
with the Sandra Curtis interview
as planned.

09:33.639 --> 09:35.675
- Awesome.
- Mary Jane will do it.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.977
But the home makeover segment
was my assignment.

09:38.044 --> 09:40.713
No, it's a hot button
political and social issue now.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.048
That's different.

09:42.114 --> 09:44.250
Justin, you can work up some questions?

09:44.317 --> 09:48.287
Sure, but Kara doesn't have a segment
in the 7 a.m. hour.

09:48.354 --> 09:49.355
Maybe she can do it.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.458
No, Kara will do the consumer report
segment with Emma.

09:52.525 --> 09:54.226
You're okay with that, right?

09:55.461 --> 09:56.862
I'll get right on it.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.030
- Great.
- Yeah.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.085
No, nothing yet, Grandma.

10:19.485 --> 10:21.153
But I'm watching her like a hawk.

10:22.254 --> 10:23.255
Trust me.

10:25.624 --> 10:29.061
Whatever Auntie is hiding, I'll find out.
Don't worry, okay?

10:29.895 --> 10:31.197
I'll talk to you later.

10:31.263 --> 10:33.199
Kiss Isabelle and Treyvion for me, okay?

10:33.265 --> 10:34.367
Love you. Bye.

10:37.036 --> 10:38.471
Go ahead, give it a try.

10:38.537 --> 10:40.840
Okay, let me see this.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.244
Well, what do you think?

10:46.178 --> 10:47.246
It's alright.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.848
- It's alright?
- It's alright.

10:48.914 --> 10:51.050
This is authentic New York City pizza.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.219
It doesn't get any better than that.

10:53.686 --> 10:56.422
I blame that response
to the lack of culture on Atlanta.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.923
- Lack of culture?
- Yes.

10:58.958 --> 11:01.627
Akili, do you mind
if we take a sit for a little bit?

11:02.128 --> 11:03.229
Yes, of course.

11:04.363 --> 11:05.398
So, how are you?

11:05.464 --> 11:08.267
These are the wrong shoes
for all this walking.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.036
Do you ever think of buying a car?

11:10.469 --> 11:12.004
A car? In New York City?

11:12.505 --> 11:14.240
No, cars are for rich people.

11:14.306 --> 11:18.244
But in Atlanta, you'd be hard-pressed
getting around without a vehicle.

11:18.310 --> 11:19.945
- A rose for your lady?
- How much?

11:20.012 --> 11:21.013
One dollar.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.018
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

11:26.085 --> 11:27.186
No problem.

11:28.654 --> 11:31.424
You know what? I know
that's why this park looks familiar.

11:31.490 --> 11:35.394
This is where Sidney and Dre
ate hot dogs in "Brown Sugar."

11:35.461 --> 11:36.929
- You want a picture?
- Yeah.

11:37.763 --> 11:38.831
There we go.

11:40.266 --> 11:41.300
One more.

11:41.901 --> 11:44.370
- Check those out.
- Thank you.

11:51.177 --> 11:52.578
What's all this?

11:52.645 --> 11:53.979
The consumer report segment.

11:54.346 --> 11:57.616
Are toilet paper brands telling the truth
about their sheet count?

11:58.150 --> 12:00.519
We'll find out on "Great Day USA".

12:03.222 --> 12:04.990
From Bond girl to two-ply.

12:05.524 --> 12:07.359
- Kara, I'm...
- Save it.

12:07.426 --> 12:09.929
The only reason I'm stuck
in the toilet paper dog house

12:09.995 --> 12:12.731
is because Garrett thinks
his golden boy Justin can do no wrong.

12:14.133 --> 12:15.734
So, I wonder what will happen

12:15.801 --> 12:18.871
when he finds out what the two of you
have been doing behind his back.

12:18.938 --> 12:20.106
Kara, you wouldn't.

12:21.540 --> 12:22.575
Kara.

12:35.821 --> 12:38.624
No offense, but your neighborhood
is a little wretched.

12:39.391 --> 12:40.793
You sure it's safe?

12:40.860 --> 12:42.294
See the white folks out there?

12:42.628 --> 12:43.929
Gentrification at work.

12:44.697 --> 12:45.865
Good point.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.567
In Atlanta, it's either nice or hood.

12:48.634 --> 12:50.369
Take a sit. I'll get you a drink, okay?

13:21.233 --> 13:22.468
Thank you.

13:46.825 --> 13:48.160
She's going to tell Garrett.

13:48.227 --> 13:49.495
What makes you so sure?

13:49.562 --> 13:53.032
Her team is literally
unspooling toilet paper right now,

13:53.465 --> 13:55.234
all because you opted to side with Dani.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.203
We need to get back on the score point.

13:57.736 --> 13:59.238
Sandra Curtis can do that for us.

13:59.305 --> 14:02.908
And I did not side with Dani,
I agreed with her,

14:02.975 --> 14:04.443
but for very different reasons.

14:06.312 --> 14:07.446
Look...

14:09.281 --> 14:13.085
Our heads are spinning, alright?
Let's just go back to your place.

14:13.152 --> 14:15.321
- Let's get something to eat.
- My niece is in town.

14:17.089 --> 14:18.290
Yes, I forgot.

14:19.625 --> 14:22.161
Okay. So, we'll focus on the interview.
That's key.

14:22.228 --> 14:24.263
If we get a home run with Sandra Curtis,

14:24.730 --> 14:28.667
you'll have Garrett
eating out of the palm of your hand.

14:30.636 --> 14:32.171
And then we can spring it on him.

14:32.238 --> 14:36.342
If we don't turn the tide,
I'm next on the chopping block,

14:36.842 --> 14:39.878
and I'll be damned
if I give Ronda that satisfaction.

14:39.945 --> 14:41.714
Garrett's main concern is the ratings.

14:42.348 --> 14:44.883
All we need to do
is promote the hell out of the interview.

14:45.251 --> 14:47.052
How? There's no time, Justin.

14:47.119 --> 14:51.090
The network is going to throw together
their usual 30-second spot and that's it.

14:52.591 --> 14:54.193
You don't need a spot.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.962
We can certainly milk the controversy
around her comments.

14:57.029 --> 14:59.031
But this is the age of the ground game.

14:59.098 --> 15:02.301
We need something that will create
the same kind of buzz as her rant.

15:02.368 --> 15:05.004
- Hashtag GotYouBitch.
- Okay.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.241
Alright, do you have something?

15:09.308 --> 15:11.844
How bad do you want it?
By any means necessary?

15:11.910 --> 15:12.878
Yes.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.781
Wait, no. Well...

15:15.848 --> 15:17.816
Just promise us one thing:

15:18.517 --> 15:21.220
Our hands remain clean. No fingerprints.

15:21.287 --> 15:22.421
Leave it to me.

15:26.525 --> 15:28.227
- You're about to get it.
- Here we go.

15:28.294 --> 15:29.495
Yeah!

15:31.397 --> 15:33.699
Are you kidding me? The button, now!

15:35.401 --> 15:36.635
Come on!

15:37.269 --> 15:39.338
Are you kidding me right now?

15:39.805 --> 15:41.907
- Is this my mofongo?
- Don't know.

15:41.974 --> 15:44.310
Is this my leftover mofongo, yes or no?

15:44.677 --> 15:46.912
I told you
I'd have this for dinner tonight.

15:46.979 --> 15:48.047
Don't touch anything!

15:48.547 --> 15:51.283
Alright, we're going to let you two
do your thing.

15:51.350 --> 15:53.419
- Get out.
- Later, Orlando, Kara.

15:53.485 --> 15:54.820
- Go.
- Let's go.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.798
They even got to my secret stash!

16:06.765 --> 16:08.534
All up in my damn refrigerator!

16:11.837 --> 16:13.072
Pepperoni.

16:14.873 --> 16:16.075
You do remember me.

16:20.379 --> 16:21.714
Babe, I don't understand.

16:21.780 --> 16:24.983
Why do you guys insist
on hanging out in my apartment

16:25.351 --> 16:28.420
when you have that huge penthouse
with all those fancy electronics?

16:28.487 --> 16:29.655
Isn't it obvious?

16:29.722 --> 16:31.490
We don't have all this delicious food.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.326
I'm sorry.

16:34.393 --> 16:35.994
- You...
- Baby.

16:36.061 --> 16:37.296
Come here.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.835
How was your first day back?

16:44.069 --> 16:45.070
Hell.

16:47.606 --> 16:49.174
"El demonio" was there.

16:51.477 --> 16:53.112
You know what else I found out today?

16:55.514 --> 16:59.451
Mary Jane is sleeping with Justin.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.321
- What?
- Yes.

17:03.155 --> 17:04.523
That's why she broke up with Lee.

17:06.725 --> 17:07.693
Yes.

17:08.627 --> 17:11.196
And I lost a story because of it.

17:11.630 --> 17:12.798
Shit.

17:13.799 --> 17:14.867
Yes.

17:16.101 --> 17:19.772
I mean, that's the guy
that got me fired, you know?

17:20.339 --> 17:23.142
Where's her friendship?
Where's her loyalty?

17:25.411 --> 17:27.780
And Garrett's treating me
like I'm a damn stranger,

17:27.846 --> 17:29.415
- like he doesn't know who I am.
- Hey.

17:29.848 --> 17:32.584
You got the job back.
Your reputation is intact.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.621
You've been wanting to make a move
to nightly news.

17:36.288 --> 17:37.322
Maybe do it now.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.892
And start all the way
from the bottom? No.

17:39.958 --> 17:42.361
I just got promoted to senior producer.

17:49.334 --> 17:52.438
Babe, maybe you can court Garrett, right?

17:53.372 --> 17:56.108
Invite him to a game,
maybe even an after party.

17:56.175 --> 17:58.076
- I don't know.
- Come on.

17:58.143 --> 18:01.113
You can show Mr. Repressed
how you have fun.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.849
You know I don't like
to hang out with fans after the game,

18:03.916 --> 18:05.517
when I'm all keyed up.

18:05.951 --> 18:10.589
Come on, can you imagine my cousin Marco
and Garrett hanging out in the same room?

18:11.089 --> 18:13.625
You need to leave
those clowns home, okay?

18:15.727 --> 18:17.429
Listen to me, baby.

18:17.496 --> 18:20.332
Garrett knows a lot of people.

18:20.999 --> 18:22.367
You need to think about this

18:22.434 --> 18:25.838
like your down-payment
for your future broadcasting career.

18:26.405 --> 18:29.007
This could be a win-win for both of us.

18:30.209 --> 18:31.477
Think about it.

18:31.910 --> 18:33.579
I really need this.

18:34.179 --> 18:37.049
- I really need this.
- Alright.

18:38.116 --> 18:39.885
You better remember me in your memoirs.

18:40.219 --> 18:42.421
Baby, you're getting a whole chapter.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.261
Now, if you'll excuse me,

18:49.328 --> 18:53.198
I'm going to go
and disintegrate with my pizza

18:53.899 --> 18:55.534
into a hot bath.

18:58.370 --> 19:01.006
If you rub my back, you can join me.

19:08.413 --> 19:09.648
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:10.482 --> 19:14.620
Auntie! My goodness, this is gorgeous.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.255
Thank you, baby girl.

19:17.556 --> 19:20.392
I know you must be exhausted
from all that sight-seeing.

19:20.459 --> 19:21.527
You had a long day.

19:21.593 --> 19:25.097
Yes, it was amazing. I can't wait
to show you all the pictures.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.065
Well, make yourself at home.

19:27.566 --> 19:29.401
Okay, where's the guestroom?

19:30.302 --> 19:31.403
This is it.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.238
But I thought you were making big now.

19:33.605 --> 19:36.341
This place costs twice as much
as the old one.

19:37.042 --> 19:39.478
But it's smaller. You got played.

19:39.545 --> 19:41.747
No, you don't understand
New York real estate.

19:41.813 --> 19:43.749
This is the goddess treatment.

19:44.316 --> 19:47.986
Well, even the Cosby's had a guestroom.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.323
Well, the Cosby house
is actually not far from here,

19:51.390 --> 19:52.558
if you want to go see it.

19:56.161 --> 19:57.329
What?

19:57.396 --> 20:00.032
You just seem different
than what I expected.

20:00.098 --> 20:01.700
And what were you expecting?

20:01.767 --> 20:03.969
For you to be all salty
and soap-opera like.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.137
Because of Lee?

20:05.203 --> 20:07.539
Honey, when you've had
as many breakups as I have,

20:07.606 --> 20:08.807
you develop a thick skin.

20:09.241 --> 20:11.376
That's not my experience,
but if you say so.

20:14.246 --> 20:16.481
- Yeah.
- Is that the guy from your office?

20:16.548 --> 20:17.849
Yes, Justin.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.519
But I'm not discussing work right now.

20:20.586 --> 20:21.787
This is family time.

20:23.322 --> 20:24.790
Do you want some hot cocoa?

20:24.856 --> 20:26.658
- I have salted caramel.
- Okay.

20:26.725 --> 20:27.693
Okay.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.762
Why is he Facetiming you
if it's for work?

20:32.598 --> 20:35.267
Justin, Mary Jane,
have you seen this article?

20:37.970 --> 20:41.873
"Home and garden guru, Sandra Curtis,
secret lesbian past revealed."

20:41.940 --> 20:45.410
"Home-making homophobe's
hidden lesbian history."

20:45.477 --> 20:48.880
"Decorating diva loves the carpet
and the drapes."

20:49.214 --> 20:52.351
Alright. This is begging
for a segment on fake news stories.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.454
This has really gotten out of hand.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.890
Now, Sandra wants to use your interview
to clear up this rumor.

20:59.224 --> 21:01.960
Yeah, I don't know. I mean...

21:02.260 --> 21:05.731
Maybe this gives us
the ratings boost we need, though.

21:14.506 --> 21:17.809
What kind of journalists are we?
We're literally generating fake news.

21:17.876 --> 21:19.411
We didn't generate this, remember?

21:19.945 --> 21:21.013
Not directly.

21:21.079 --> 21:24.282
Look, this woman's comments are vile.
Don't waste your guilt on her.

21:24.349 --> 21:26.752
Do you use a microscope
to split those hairs?

21:26.818 --> 21:28.086
She'll come on the show.

21:28.153 --> 21:29.855
She'll dispel the rumors

21:30.222 --> 21:32.958
and a lot of people
who normally don't watch the show, will.

21:37.496 --> 21:40.432
I wish this didn't leave
such a bad taste in my mouth.

21:40.499 --> 21:42.034
It's a means to an end, right?

21:43.969 --> 21:45.037
Right?

21:48.073 --> 21:49.074
Right.

21:49.675 --> 21:50.876
Good.

21:50.942 --> 21:53.745
Now, if we could get Kara
to keep her mouth shut in the meantime...

21:56.548 --> 22:00.552
Popular culture
wants to normalize this behavior.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.321
But our young people need to know.

22:04.189 --> 22:06.425
If they allow themselves to be seduced

22:06.892 --> 22:09.461
<i>by the evil homosexual spirits,</i>

22:09.961 --> 22:13.665
<i>they will be subjected
to eternal damnation.</i>

22:16.835 --> 22:20.372
I'm sorry.
I was just taking some additional notes.

22:20.439 --> 22:23.408
Please. She hasn't said anything
I haven't heard from my parents

22:23.475 --> 22:25.077
every damn day since I came out.

22:25.911 --> 22:27.746
- Sorry to hear that.
- Don't be.

22:28.313 --> 22:29.948
Just bury that bitch.

22:30.382 --> 22:35.187
I have never, in my entire life,
been involved with a woman that way.

22:35.620 --> 22:37.456
But what would you say to those

22:38.123 --> 22:39.958
who found your comments in that video

22:40.859 --> 22:42.828
to be hateful and anti-gay?

22:43.261 --> 22:45.063
<i>That's good. Don't let her off the hook.</i>

22:45.130 --> 22:47.065
Go hard but keep it respectful.

22:47.566 --> 22:51.436
<i>I was raised to believe strongly
in the word of Christ.</i>

22:51.503 --> 22:53.905
The Bible is very consistent.

22:54.239 --> 22:56.374
Homosexual acts are a sin.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.044
The Bible also forbids tattoos,

22:59.111 --> 23:01.113
the wearing of mixed fabrics,

23:01.179 --> 23:03.482
<i>and eating pork, premarital sex</i>

23:03.548 --> 23:04.783
<i>the feeding of lawns.</i>

23:04.850 --> 23:07.652
<i>Do you also take
those condemnations literally?</i>

23:07.719 --> 23:10.856
People in the African-American community

23:10.922 --> 23:13.859
who share similar religious views as mine

23:14.226 --> 23:16.862
feel the same way about homosexuality.

23:17.696 --> 23:21.533
And some would argue
that they are just as wrong as you.

23:22.200 --> 23:25.704
That they, too,
are cherry-picking Bible verses

23:25.771 --> 23:29.107
and using them to restrict
the Gay community civil rights.

23:29.174 --> 23:32.310
You shouldn't get special rights
because of who you sleep with.

23:32.377 --> 23:34.846
Equal, not special.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.515
See? This is the problem.

23:36.581 --> 23:38.917
God fearing people can't preach the word

23:38.984 --> 23:42.988
without fear
of some mob-mentality backlash.

23:43.054 --> 23:45.824
Is religious freedom
really being attacked, Sandra?

23:45.891 --> 23:48.860
Or has that just become
the go-to dog whistle

23:48.927 --> 23:51.530
for anyone
who has been called out for bigotry?

23:51.596 --> 23:53.098
Just look at what's happening now.

23:53.465 --> 23:57.469
I'm basically being criticized
for believing in Christ.

23:57.536 --> 24:01.873
I would imagine that the backlash
has been difficult for you.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.277
It has.

24:06.344 --> 24:07.679
I love my work.

24:08.814 --> 24:09.815
And now...

24:14.352 --> 24:15.687
It has been hard.

24:15.754 --> 24:18.957
So, what about those in the gay community
that you've worked with

24:19.024 --> 24:22.460
in the design and decorating industry
who feel injured by your comments

24:22.527 --> 24:24.930
or those who've purchased your products?

24:25.297 --> 24:26.431
What would you say to them?

24:29.634 --> 24:30.836
Jesus loves you.

24:32.103 --> 24:34.372
Sandra Curtis, thank you for coming on.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.209
Good job, Mary Jane. That was great TV.

24:39.644 --> 24:40.645
Nice work.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.981
You and Mary Jane
are really hitting your stride.

24:43.548 --> 24:44.583
Thank you.

24:46.384 --> 24:47.352
Hey.

24:48.753 --> 24:49.821
What's this?

24:49.888 --> 24:52.057
You like to support
the hometown team, right?

24:52.123 --> 24:53.425
Field level?

24:53.859 --> 24:54.893
Kara...

24:55.293 --> 24:57.896
It's just my way of saying thank you
for bringing me back.

24:58.663 --> 24:59.798
- Yes.
- Enjoy.

25:03.935 --> 25:05.370
She was really great today.

25:05.704 --> 25:07.539
Yeah, she was great.

25:07.606 --> 25:09.207
And the camera just loves her.

25:11.743 --> 25:14.679
I sure would like to sink my teeth
into that peach.

25:15.747 --> 25:17.048
You know what I'm saying?

25:19.684 --> 25:20.619
MJ!

25:22.320 --> 25:24.122
You did such a great job!

25:24.656 --> 25:26.892
It's Mary Jane, and thank you.

25:26.958 --> 25:28.426
To be truly fair and balanced,

25:28.493 --> 25:31.963
is to adequately explore an issue
from both sides

25:32.030 --> 25:34.666
without letting your personal ideology
cloud your peace.

25:34.733 --> 25:35.700
Exactly.

25:36.568 --> 25:38.503
You know, I'm so curious.

25:38.570 --> 25:41.172
Dani, are you going to give tips
to all of our guests

25:41.239 --> 25:43.608
or just Sandra Curtis?

25:43.975 --> 25:45.911
You didn't expect me to buy
that she came up

25:45.977 --> 25:48.713
with the whole Black community comparison
on her own, did you?

25:49.114 --> 25:51.917
If you want to be a part
of the "GDU" family,

25:51.983 --> 25:54.185
it would behoove you to remember

25:54.686 --> 25:57.022
on what side your bread is buttered.

26:06.298 --> 26:08.266
Good job on the piece.
Garrett is thrilled.

26:08.600 --> 26:09.701
Thank you.

26:10.035 --> 26:12.037
It was so hard, because I'm...

26:12.504 --> 26:15.206
I'm pretty sure
that there's some truth to the story.

26:15.273 --> 26:17.542
- I mean, home-girl was protesting...
- Stop.

26:18.677 --> 26:21.413
I paid you a compliment.
That doesn't make us friends again.

26:21.479 --> 26:22.948
Kara, I screwed up.

26:23.014 --> 26:25.116
It's not charming, but I'm human.

26:25.583 --> 26:26.785
And I owned up to it.

26:27.185 --> 26:29.120
No, you don't get to play a victim.

26:29.487 --> 26:30.755
You're entitled to mess up,

26:30.822 --> 26:33.591
but I'm entitled to make that mess-up
my last straw.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.573
Hamptons, you're having a good time?

26:48.640 --> 26:50.175
Awesome, awesome.

26:50.241 --> 26:52.010
Best night of my life.

26:52.077 --> 26:54.579
Hey, here's to proving
you can hang with the big boys.

26:57.482 --> 26:58.550
"Salud."

27:00.652 --> 27:02.420
She's pretty hot. Right, Hamptons?

27:02.487 --> 27:03.555
You want to meet her?

27:03.621 --> 27:05.290
No, I'm good.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.325
- I'll ask her.
- I'm good.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.328
Garrett, I want you to meet Esther.

27:10.395 --> 27:12.297
Esther, meet my man, Garrett.

27:12.364 --> 27:15.233
But you can call him Hamptons,
because we all do, right?

27:15.300 --> 27:16.935
It's nice to meet you, Esther.

27:17.602 --> 27:19.404
My God, you're beautiful.

27:36.121 --> 27:37.122
Come on.

27:41.559 --> 27:42.527
My God!

27:42.961 --> 27:44.329
Hell no!

27:44.729 --> 27:46.064
No, no!

27:47.599 --> 27:49.034
I'll be right back, Hamptons.

27:49.100 --> 27:52.604
- I told you...
- What's up?

27:52.670 --> 27:54.005
<i>Why don't you listen?</i>

27:54.072 --> 27:56.408
Wow, calm down.

27:56.808 --> 27:58.043
<i>Enough, let me...</i>

27:58.109 --> 28:00.245
<i>- Everything's cool.
- Get out of there.</i>

28:00.311 --> 28:02.881
<i>- Garrett's enjoying himself.
- Enjoying himself?</i>

28:02.947 --> 28:05.116
<i>I've seen all the photos, Orlando.</i>

28:05.183 --> 28:07.485
Hey, calm down. I can't understand you.

28:07.552 --> 28:09.521
<i>I shouldn't have let you go out together.</i>

28:09.587 --> 28:11.923
<i>- Why did I let you go out with him?
- You don't trust me?</i>

28:11.990 --> 28:13.091
<i>Damn.</i>

28:14.592 --> 28:16.761
My boys are behaving themselves, alright?

28:17.128 --> 28:18.897
I'm telling you, "mi amor". Trust me.

28:18.963 --> 28:21.433
You precious Garrett is perfectly fine.

28:23.635 --> 28:26.805
- Maybe not do that.
- Damn!

28:55.100 --> 28:56.568
What the hell is going on?

28:56.634 --> 28:57.902
What are you doing?

28:57.969 --> 28:59.804
What does it look like? I'm painting you.

28:59.871 --> 29:02.340
Not like this. My hair is all messed up.

29:02.674 --> 29:04.676
I have sleep in my eyes. Are you crazy?

29:04.742 --> 29:06.244
Girl, hush all that up.

29:06.311 --> 29:07.512
You look beautiful.

29:09.781 --> 29:11.349
So wait, you're a painter?

29:11.716 --> 29:14.919
I thought when you said artist,
you meant a rapper or whatever.

29:15.620 --> 29:16.688
No.

29:28.166 --> 29:29.434
Did you paint all of this?

29:30.034 --> 29:32.437
So, you obviously got a thing
for big girls.

29:34.038 --> 29:36.074
Is that why you responded to my profile?

29:36.407 --> 29:37.642
I mean, I'm not going to lie.

29:38.176 --> 29:39.644
Your profile was sexy,

29:39.711 --> 29:41.045
but I read your tweets

29:41.112 --> 29:43.481
and you seemed like a real woman
who's about something.

29:45.416 --> 29:46.818
Well, these aren't bad, Akili.

29:47.785 --> 29:49.687
- Thank you.
- How much do you sell them for?

29:49.754 --> 29:50.788
Nothing yet.

29:50.855 --> 29:52.590
I do maintenance in exchange for rent.

29:52.657 --> 29:54.392
That gives me time to work on my art.

29:54.459 --> 29:57.795
Beats working at some crappy desk job
or busting tables at a restaurant.

29:57.862 --> 30:00.632
A place this size,
they should be paying you to live here.

30:01.166 --> 30:02.600
You don't get claustrophobic?

30:02.667 --> 30:04.102
No, that's New York.

30:04.169 --> 30:07.405
In a city with nine million people,
space comes at a premium.

30:07.472 --> 30:08.740
I'm happy I have a spot.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.609
I used to live with my mom
up until a year ago,

30:11.676 --> 30:12.810
if you can believe that.

30:14.379 --> 30:17.649
My aunt lives in Manhattan,
and she could by a mansion in Atlanta

30:17.715 --> 30:20.151
for what she paid
for a regular size apartment here.

30:20.218 --> 30:22.987
Your aunt, that's Mary Jane Paul, right?

30:23.388 --> 30:25.056
Maybe she'll be interested in my work.

30:25.790 --> 30:28.693
A high-profile person like that
could really help a brother out.

30:29.594 --> 30:30.929
Look, come check it out.

30:34.532 --> 30:36.935
- Like a Black Botticelli angel.
- Bota-who?

30:39.037 --> 30:40.338
You wouldn't know what I mean.

30:41.406 --> 30:42.707
So, what do you think?

30:43.074 --> 30:44.309
Can I get an introduction?

30:48.213 --> 30:49.147
Hi.

30:49.714 --> 30:50.815
- Kara.
- Yeah.

30:51.816 --> 30:53.952
Last night was so...

30:55.053 --> 30:56.120
Awesome!

30:56.821 --> 30:58.623
I mean, look at this. Look at it.

30:58.690 --> 30:59.924
What am I looking at?

31:00.558 --> 31:03.027
- That's my battle scar.
- Wow, that looks like it hurt.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.129
It hurt.

31:05.196 --> 31:06.631
It hurt so good.

31:07.298 --> 31:09.968
And afterwards,
there was this woman, Esther, with...

31:11.102 --> 31:12.470
She was...

31:12.537 --> 31:14.672
- Please, don't sue me for saying this.
- No.

31:14.739 --> 31:16.074
She was so gorgeous.

31:16.674 --> 31:18.643
What a night!

31:20.378 --> 31:21.713
I can't wait to do it again.

31:21.779 --> 31:23.014
Okay.

31:23.081 --> 31:24.249
I'll...

31:24.649 --> 31:27.051
- I'll talk to Orlando.
- Would you really?

31:27.118 --> 31:28.519
That would be amazing.

31:28.586 --> 31:30.488
Sure, I'll be in touch.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.223
- Thank you.
- Absolutely.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.360
I'm sorry we didn't have a chance
to spend any time together.

31:36.027 --> 31:37.662
Did you enjoy the sights, at least?

31:37.729 --> 31:39.264
Yes, the sights were good.

31:40.231 --> 31:41.332
But...

31:42.500 --> 31:44.335
I have a confession to make.

31:44.836 --> 31:45.837
Okay.

31:46.537 --> 31:47.605
There was a guy.

31:47.672 --> 31:50.808
Niecy, a guy? You were here, what?
Two days? Where did you meet a guy?

31:50.875 --> 31:52.110
The normal way. Online.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.178
Goodness.

31:54.712 --> 31:57.849
Was it good? Were you safe?
Just tell me you were safe.

31:57.915 --> 31:59.384
Yes, of course I was safe.

31:59.450 --> 32:00.652
I'm not gonna be dumb again.

32:00.985 --> 32:03.655
And the sex was pretty good.

32:03.721 --> 32:05.690
- And?
- And he's alright.

32:05.757 --> 32:09.260
I mean, he's just as poor
as those broke-ass dudes in Atlanta.

32:09.327 --> 32:10.495
Is that right?

32:11.095 --> 32:13.031
Coming at me like: "Baby, I have a job."

32:13.097 --> 32:16.167
Boy, handing out paintings
on the stoop of your apartment building

32:16.734 --> 32:17.835
is no damn job.

32:18.403 --> 32:19.837
But he did give me this.

32:24.442 --> 32:26.110
- Yeah.
- Wow.

32:26.544 --> 32:28.313
Niecy, this is gorgeous.

32:28.379 --> 32:29.714
Your boy has some talent.

32:30.081 --> 32:31.783
If you want to buy it, it's 999 dollars.

32:32.617 --> 32:35.887
His broke ass only wanted help
getting his art out there, so...

32:36.254 --> 32:37.889
And what did your broke ass want?

32:37.955 --> 32:39.891
To come to New York
and find a sugar daddy

32:39.957 --> 32:42.760
who's gonna solve all your problems
and take care of you?

32:43.127 --> 32:44.095
Right?

32:44.796 --> 32:47.999
Look, your broke back artist,
he might not have any bank,

32:48.900 --> 32:50.535
but he found his passion.

32:50.868 --> 32:52.737
Maybe it's time to get real with yourself

32:52.804 --> 32:54.972
and find the thing that makes you
want to wake up.

32:55.039 --> 32:56.574
What if I can't find it?

32:56.941 --> 32:58.509
Auntie, you have all of this.

32:58.576 --> 33:01.846
What if I'm just regular?

33:02.280 --> 33:04.615
Regular? You don't know that.

33:04.682 --> 33:05.717
How come I don't?

33:06.050 --> 33:08.052
Because you haven't even tried, have you?

33:09.821 --> 33:11.422
And now, another piece of advice.

33:11.489 --> 33:12.590
Hold on to that painting.

33:13.324 --> 33:16.594
If old boy ends up the next Basquiat,
that'll be worth some coin.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.162
- Please.
- I'm serious.

33:18.229 --> 33:19.430
Sorry to interrupt.

33:21.165 --> 33:22.767
Justin, this is my niece, Nicole.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.535
Nicole, this is my producer, Justin.

33:24.869 --> 33:26.971
Hi. Everybody calls me Niecy.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.474
- Nice to meet you, Niecy.
- Nice to meet you, too.

33:30.174 --> 33:33.378
I just wanted to go over that story
about the boy who's building robots.

33:33.444 --> 33:35.413
Okay, give me a second. I'll see her out.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.014
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

33:40.618 --> 33:41.619
What?

33:42.120 --> 33:43.921
So, what do you want me to tell Grandma?

33:43.988 --> 33:45.690
Nothing. What are you talking about?

33:45.757 --> 33:47.258
You're a terrible liar, Auntie.

33:47.325 --> 33:49.127
Hashtag LightEyes.

33:49.193 --> 33:52.997
He seems to be a little too deep
in the game for my liking.

33:53.064 --> 33:56.234
However, so are you.
So, it might be a match made in heaven.

33:57.301 --> 33:59.337
Did Grandma send you out here
to spy on me?

33:59.404 --> 34:02.807
She said if you cheated on Lee,
it had to be with someone fine, so...

34:02.874 --> 34:04.108
She knows I cheated on him?

34:04.776 --> 34:08.746
Look, Grandma is only in your business
because she's worried about you.

34:08.813 --> 34:11.549
- Because she thinks I'll end up alone.
- Basically.

34:11.616 --> 34:13.117
Well, tell her that I...

34:13.684 --> 34:15.920
I have not given up on love.

34:16.954 --> 34:20.391
You know? No.
No, don't say anything, just...

34:21.159 --> 34:22.693
Just give it a little time.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.129
Or I can tell her
why you really came to New York.

34:25.196 --> 34:28.266
Don't worry,
I won't go bumping my gums just yet.

34:29.667 --> 34:33.037
You're lucky Garrett had
a good time, okay?

34:33.604 --> 34:34.939
Which I still can't believe.

34:35.006 --> 34:36.274
<i>What is wrong with him?</i>

34:36.340 --> 34:37.642
He doesn't get out much.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.777
I totally thought
I was getting fired again.

34:40.711 --> 34:43.147
How did his goofy ass
managed to get laid anyway?

34:43.514 --> 34:47.385
She liked him.
In a pity party kind of way.

34:48.586 --> 34:50.054
So, everything was real nice?

34:50.488 --> 34:52.557
You have nothing to worry about.

34:52.623 --> 34:53.658
<i>Yeah, this time.</i>

34:54.192 --> 34:55.827
<i>But, I promise you, Orlando,</i>

34:55.893 --> 34:59.597
if you think continuing to pal around
with all your frat house brothers

34:59.664 --> 35:02.233
is going to get you
the broadcasting career you want,

35:02.300 --> 35:04.168
<i>you have a rude awakening coming, okay?</i>

35:04.502 --> 35:06.471
I don't think I heard
"Thank you, Orlando"

35:06.537 --> 35:07.772
once in this conversation.

35:08.339 --> 35:09.574
Thank you, Orlando.

35:10.308 --> 35:14.078
I'm serious, "papi".
I do appreciate your help.

35:14.645 --> 35:17.548
- But my point is still valid.
- What point?

35:18.282 --> 35:20.184
<i>You're never going to have
a grown-up life</i>

35:20.251 --> 35:22.587
<i>if you keep dragging around
that posse of lost boys.</i>

35:22.653 --> 35:23.788
<i>That's the point.</i>

35:31.896 --> 35:33.164
Ratings came in.

35:34.198 --> 35:35.266
And?

35:36.567 --> 35:38.302
They're even better than we thought.

35:38.369 --> 35:39.470
Let me see!

35:42.006 --> 35:43.140
My God!

35:43.207 --> 35:44.709
My God!

35:45.576 --> 35:46.644
Wow!

35:47.378 --> 35:48.913
I always knew we were a great team.

35:53.951 --> 35:55.753
Garrett just saw the ratings as well.

35:56.420 --> 35:58.055
I don't mind a pat on the back, do you?

35:58.122 --> 35:59.490
Not at all.

35:59.557 --> 36:03.060
I don't like to be kept in the dark
about what's happening on my show.

36:04.028 --> 36:06.264
- What do you mean?
- You two. You're involved.

36:06.731 --> 36:07.832
Romantically.

36:08.499 --> 36:11.669
We are seeing each other, but it's...

36:11.736 --> 36:14.205
I can assure you,
it'll have no effect on our work.

36:14.272 --> 36:16.007
- You've seen the numbers.
- I did.

36:16.073 --> 36:19.443
But just because this
hasn't negatively affected your work yet,

36:19.777 --> 36:22.813
there are a million other reasons
why this thing is a problem.

36:23.314 --> 36:26.117
We're not breaking any rules
that haven't already been broken.

36:26.450 --> 36:28.886
"GDU" is literally a graveyard
of Aaron's conquests.

36:28.953 --> 36:31.422
This is an egregious double standard.

36:31.489 --> 36:33.991
You're not going to attack
Aaron's character

36:34.058 --> 36:36.594
based on unsubstantiated rumors. Besides...

36:36.661 --> 36:39.230
Justin is a senior producer,
not some intern

36:39.297 --> 36:40.598
or production assistant.

36:40.665 --> 36:43.701
He needs to rule on story assignments,
work details.

36:43.768 --> 36:47.104
How can I believe that he'll be fair,
balanced and impartial?

36:47.171 --> 36:48.372
Because I always am.

36:48.439 --> 36:51.509
Look, relationships are messy
and after what happened with Kara,

36:51.576 --> 36:54.612
execs are concerned about anything
that could result in a lawsuit.

36:54.679 --> 36:57.281
Disclosing our relationship
eliminates that concern.

36:57.348 --> 36:59.817
- We can't sue.
- That doesn't eliminate their concern

36:59.884 --> 37:01.485
about you, Mary Jane.

37:02.153 --> 37:04.455
Trust me, you don't want to give them
another reason

37:04.522 --> 37:06.724
to question your suitability
on this show.

37:07.224 --> 37:09.860
I need to assure everyone upstairs
that I run a tight ship,

37:09.927 --> 37:12.930
So, Justin,
I'm taking you off Mary Jane's stories

37:12.997 --> 37:14.665
- effective immediately.
- What?

37:14.732 --> 37:15.900
That's not all.

37:15.967 --> 37:17.868
Justin, I'm sending you to Kansas,

37:17.935 --> 37:20.371
with Sylvia to cover a developing story.

37:20.438 --> 37:21.839
An uprising is brewing

37:21.906 --> 37:24.575
over the fiscal mismanagement
in the state's capital.

37:24.642 --> 37:28.012
With all due respect,
this feels like a bit of an overreach.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.448
I'll relay that to the News Director
when I see him,

37:30.514 --> 37:32.183
but, until then, it's Kansas.

37:33.384 --> 37:34.986
Your flight leaves this afternoon.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.233
Can I see you in my office, please?

37:54.138 --> 37:56.707
I know you were upset
about my relationship with Justin,

37:56.774 --> 37:58.342
but I never thought you'd rat me out.

37:58.976 --> 38:01.345
- Excuse me?
- Admit it. You told Garrett.

38:01.846 --> 38:04.415
I should have.
I had plenty of reasons to.

38:04.482 --> 38:06.617
But just because
you've been a bad friend to me,

38:06.684 --> 38:07.885
doesn't mean that I am.

38:08.285 --> 38:11.022
I don't need to crap all over somebody
to get ahead, Mary Jane.

38:11.422 --> 38:12.623
That's Justin's MO.

38:13.024 --> 38:15.426
Why are you so mad
about my relationship with him?

38:15.493 --> 38:17.361
I'm not mad, I'm hurt.

38:17.728 --> 38:19.730
It's only been a few days,
and look at you,

38:19.797 --> 38:21.899
running around, trying to clean his crap.

38:21.966 --> 38:24.935
It's just like Andre, David, and Sheldon.

38:25.536 --> 38:27.304
But what you don't seem to realize

38:27.371 --> 38:29.640
is that I'm on this roller-coaster ride
with you,

38:29.707 --> 38:32.543
so, when you decide to jump off,
I feel the scrapes too.

38:32.877 --> 38:35.446
But, you know what? I'm done. That's it.

38:35.513 --> 38:37.048
You hear me? Done.

38:37.815 --> 38:38.816
Kara.

38:40.051 --> 38:41.419
So, you didn't tell Garrett.

38:41.786 --> 38:44.488
That's the thing about making
so many enemies, Mary Jane.

38:45.022 --> 38:48.159
When you get stabbed in the back,
you don't know which one did it.

38:59.403 --> 39:00.738
Kansas, right?

39:01.338 --> 39:02.506
You heard?

39:02.573 --> 39:03.641
Word of advice:

39:03.708 --> 39:05.609
You might want to work
on your poker face.

39:05.676 --> 39:07.511
It's too strong. It's an obvious tell.

39:07.578 --> 39:10.614
- I don't follow.
- When I commented on Mary Jane's ass,

39:11.082 --> 39:12.583
you didn't so much as flinch.

39:13.951 --> 39:15.419
It was you that told Garrett.

39:15.486 --> 39:17.588
If you and Mary Jane
think you'll get rid of me

39:17.655 --> 39:19.390
as easily as you got rid of Ronda...

39:21.525 --> 39:22.660
<i>It was Aaron.</i>

39:23.327 --> 39:25.863
- That snake. How did he even know?
- I don't know.

39:26.230 --> 39:27.198
He figured it out.

39:28.599 --> 39:31.035
Getting on top it's going to be harder
than we planned.

39:31.368 --> 39:35.372
Now that we've got Aaron and Garrett
to contend with, yes.

39:37.675 --> 39:38.909
My car's here.

39:40.377 --> 39:42.713
I can't believe you'll be gone
for a whole week.

39:43.047 --> 39:44.115
At least.

39:44.849 --> 39:46.751
If the story blows up,
it could be longer.

39:50.087 --> 39:51.122
Jesus.

39:59.997 --> 40:02.533
Looks like the cat
is all the way out of the bag now.

40:03.934 --> 40:04.969
Yes.

40:09.840 --> 40:10.941
Hey.

40:11.709 --> 40:12.943
Be careful out there, okay?
