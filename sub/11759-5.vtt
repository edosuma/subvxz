WEBVTT

00:04.600 --> 00:06.250
<i>Danny tried to say something.</i>

00:06.280 --> 00:08.203
Now I reckon
what he said was "list".

00:08.240 --> 00:10.925
What was Danny onto
that meant you had to kill him'?

00:13.440 --> 00:16.204
MANEET: <i>The report states
these findings are consistent</i>

00:16.239 --> 00:17.924
<i>with a blood-stained</i> note.

00:17.960 --> 00:20.361
And this is just between us
for now'?

00:24.760 --> 00:29.641
I'm innocent.
The question is, are you'?

00:30.360 --> 00:34.604
You lied in court, you lied to
your partner and you lied to me!

00:34.640 --> 00:36.404
I did not plant evidence.

00:38.920 --> 00:41.890
The people decided she didn't
do it, because you couldn't

00:41.920 --> 00:44.446
- keep it in your pants.
- That's not what happened.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.130
There's seconds, if you fancy.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.208
Any more
and I won't get off this sofa.

00:53.280 --> 00:56.841
I had intended that meeting
in a more social setting

00:56.880 --> 00:59.406
would make this
less confrontational between us.

01:03.440 --> 01:06.523
- I'm a married man.
- Separated.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.528
I'm sorry, Gill.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.686
Oliver Stephens-Lloyd,
a registered social worker

01:14.720 --> 01:16.688
with responsibility
at Sands View.

01:16.720 --> 01:19.883
Chief Superintendent Fairbank
had nothing to do with the case.

01:19.920 --> 01:22.082
He ran Vice.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.809
<i>Stephens-Lloyd claimed he had
a list of authority figures</i>

01:27.840 --> 01:30.286
who systematically abused boys
at Sands View.

01:30.320 --> 01:33.881
I've never even heard
of this "Stands View" place.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.729
HASTINGS: Hope I'm not too late.

01:35.760 --> 01:39.765
I saw the handshake at the door.
It was Masonic.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.970
(Siren)

01:45.000 --> 01:47.002
I'm putting you in
for a commendation.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.491
<i>Ronan Murphy was interviewed</i>

01:49.520 --> 01:51.648
<i>about the conspiracy
Demon was convicted of.</i>

01:51.680 --> 01:53.523
None of this was in the file.

01:53.560 --> 01:55.767
<i>And who gave us that file'?</i>

01:55.800 --> 01:57.325
Hastings.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.048
The Caddy is male, under 35.

02:04.080 --> 02:08.130
A detective.
A London or Southeast accent.

02:10.440 --> 02:14.490
<i>Sorry, gaffer, but the finger's
pointing atone of our own.</i>

02:17.000 --> 02:19.241
Detective Inspector
Matthew Cottan...

02:20.000 --> 02:22.241
...has distinguished
not only himself...

02:22.280 --> 02:25.489
but the entire
anti-corruption division.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.126
Detective Inspector
Matthew Cottan.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.766
It's an honour to present
DI Cottan with this award

02:32.800 --> 02:34.723
for Outstanding Bravery.

02:34.760 --> 02:37.923
The commendation reads:
"For courageous conduct

02:37.960 --> 02:39.962
in apprehending
a dangerous suspect,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.526
with commendable disregard
for personal safety."

02:42.560 --> 02:45.131
- Well done, Cottan.
- Thank you, sir.

02:47.880 --> 02:50.360
(Cheering)

02:55.000 --> 02:56.604
Smile!

03:10.520 --> 03:12.841
- Congratulations, Matthew.
- Ah, thanks, Gill.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.360
You need a drink. There you go.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.402
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.402
Have you thought about
going in front of

03:20.440 --> 03:22.249
the DCI promotion board?

03:34.680 --> 03:37.968
- Right. Coffee'?
- Yeah. Lovely.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.561
Don't be going to any trouble on
my account. I'll have instant.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.602
Special occasion, though.

03:44.840 --> 03:48.083
Actually, it's good to be able
to talk outside the office.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.010
Is everything OK'?

03:53.520 --> 03:55.409
No. Not really.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.647
Steve's been ordering
more forensics on evidence

03:59.680 --> 04:02.047
seized from
Danny Waldron's flat.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.411
Why'?

04:03.440 --> 04:05.841
He'll be making out
I missed a lead.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.291
I know what he's up to.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.129
It's classic classroom tactics.

04:09.160 --> 04:12.289
If you've famed, you hold your
nose and point at someone else.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.163
What do you mean'?

04:15.760 --> 04:18.649
- He's hiding summat.
- What?

04:18.680 --> 04:20.841
I shouldn't say
until there's evidence.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.160
I hope I'm wrong. I really do.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.922
But if I'm not...

04:28.040 --> 04:30.168
...l need to know
you've got my back.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.246
God, yeah.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.567
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.204
I know you two go back a-ways.

04:36.240 --> 04:37.924
No, you had to.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.889
MANI Glock 17.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.930
<i>Though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death...</i>

04:55.000 --> 04:57.048
<i>...l will fear no evil.</i>

04:58.040 --> 05:03.524
<i>For You are with me; Your rod
and staff, they comfort me.</i>

05:04.480 --> 05:07.882
We now commit Daniel's body
to the ground.

05:08.400 --> 05:13.566
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust...

05:15.560 --> 05:18.086
...in the sure and certain hope

05:18.120 --> 05:20.361
of the resurrection
to eternal life.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.522
(Security gate bleeps)

06:10.960 --> 06:13.725
- ls there a problem, sir'?
- Why do you ask'?

06:13.760 --> 06:15.888
There was a briefing,
inspectors and above,

06:15.920 --> 06:17.445
and no-one's
letting me in on it.

06:17.480 --> 06:20.689
Hence "inspectors and above".

06:23.720 --> 06:25.882
So, what's that about, then'?

06:27.200 --> 06:29.202
I went to
Danny Waldron's funeral.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.891
There's still a threat to anyone
associated with Danny.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.922
And was anyone there?

06:35.320 --> 06:37.004
- No.
- No.

06:37.040 --> 06:39.042
Well, that's good to know, eh'?

06:39.080 --> 06:41.686
And you shouldn't be
bringing that round here.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.722
This isn't the Bronx.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.762
(Drops spoon as he leaves)

06:51.160 --> 06:53.401
Feeling better?

06:53.440 --> 06:56.330
Er...yeah, thanks.
Just a stomach bug.

06:56.360 --> 06:59.364
Well, I was hoping to get
those forensics I requested.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.970
What's the hold-up'?

07:03.000 --> 07:06.004
I don't want to get caught
between you and DI Cottan.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.963
What do you mean'?

07:15.440 --> 07:17.920
He knew forensics
hadn't tested the envelope'?

07:26.160 --> 07:27.844
I'll be right back.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.522
(Mouse clicking)

08:25.880 --> 08:30.204
MAN: 17. Serial number
and number and type of rounds.

08:36.159 --> 08:37.571
Cheers.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.722
6-36 carbine, plus rounds.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.483
You wanted me to see something?

08:50.520 --> 08:54.366
Yeah. I've been reviewing CCTV
of Danny Waldron

08:54.400 --> 08:56.767
from the murder time-line
of Linus Murphy.

08:58.400 --> 09:01.483
Here's Danny arriving.
Note the direction of travel.

09:01.520 --> 09:03.807
It matches the route
from Linus's residence,

09:03.840 --> 09:06.650
so we assume Danny's come
directly from killing Linus.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.210
Formal ID - it's Danny Waldron.

09:10.240 --> 09:12.720
The images tally with
the paperwork we got

09:12.760 --> 09:14.728
from the storage facility.

09:15.840 --> 09:18.684
Our assumption is that the
rucksack contains Linus's head,

09:18.720 --> 09:20.051
wrapped in a bin-liner.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.447
In the bag must be
a cold-storage container

09:22.480 --> 09:24.369
he bought en route.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.131
Now the rucksack's empty,

09:29.160 --> 09:32.050
presumably after Danny
stored Linus's head.

09:33.120 --> 09:37.284
He leaves, and we pick him up
on an exterior camera again.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.770
Danny jogging away-

09:39.800 --> 09:43.043
Note the different direction
of travel from his arrival.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.128
I just want to get the job done,
Kate.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.527
And we've always done
a good one together.

09:52.560 --> 09:57.088
The job. That I can do.
Where do you think he's going'?

09:57.120 --> 10:00.841
Unfortunately, there's
no other CCTV of Danny, but...

10:04.160 --> 10:06.049
Here's the storage facility.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.722
Here's the direction
we see him leaving.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.728
Danny's flat is located here.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.291
It appears he came directly
from Linus Murphy's place,

10:15.320 --> 10:17.129
so his only opportunity
to conceal

10:17.160 --> 10:18.844
any information
he got from Linus

10:18.880 --> 10:20.564
was when he was in his flat.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.090
What information?

10:28.600 --> 10:31.171
Ink and blood was detected
on the inside of an envelope

10:31.200 --> 10:32.884
found at Danny Waldron's flat.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.571
Now, the blood
matches to Linus Murphy.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.682
So he must have put a message
in the envelope

10:37.720 --> 10:39.324
straight from killing Murphy...

10:40.240 --> 10:42.322
...even before
he washed the blood off.

10:43.160 --> 10:46.926
It was definitely there in that
envelope. For a time, at least.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.286
Why are we only getting
this information now'?

10:52.880 --> 10:55.087
Admin cock-up. Forensics' fault.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.129
OK.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.770
All right'? Where are you off to'?

11:06.800 --> 11:08.609
<i>Muffled shaker</i>

11:16.520 --> 11:19.490
GILL: ..has to be authorised
by Superintendent-rank or above

11:19.520 --> 11:22.126
and meet the RIPA criteria.
It's not rocket science.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.291
Matthew.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.243
- Anyway, get back to me.
- Will do.

11:27.640 --> 11:29.290
Hope you're not still hung-over

11:29.320 --> 11:31.891
from all that
taxpayers' champagne'?

11:32.400 --> 11:34.323
- Have you got a minute'?
- Yeah.

11:36.440 --> 11:37.566
Look...

11:37.600 --> 11:40.285
I'm the last person
to go behind anyone's back,

11:40.320 --> 11:42.846
but I've raised concerns
about a colleague

11:42.880 --> 11:44.609
with my commanding officer.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.803
Well, if Ted's dealing with it,
I shouldn't get involved.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.411
Well, that's the problem.
He's not.

11:50.440 --> 11:53.808
Ah. I can guess
who the colleague might be.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.285
What worries me is,

11:55.320 --> 11:57.971
he's wandering around this place
with a firearm.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.171
Oh, my God.

12:00.200 --> 12:03.807
Sorry.
Look, maybe I shouldn't have...

12:03.840 --> 12:06.207
No. Leave it with me.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.962
Thanks, Gill.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.770
Got a lead on Fairbank.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.610
Digging into his records,

12:24.640 --> 12:27.849
there was a complaint made
by someone called Wendy Rider.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.611
The complaint wasn't pursued
because Fairbank retired.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.210
What was the complaint?

12:32.240 --> 12:34.846
Where Chief Superintendent
Fairbank's concerned,

12:34.880 --> 12:37.326
the records are sketchy,
to say the least.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.964
But it was about her son.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.083
He was a resident
at Sands View Boys' Home.

12:42.120 --> 12:45.567
He's overseas with the Army new,
but she still lives in the area.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.169
Nice work.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.922
Just doing my job, mate.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.723
Do you remember
when he went to Sands View

12:55.760 --> 12:57.922
and how long he was there?

12:57.960 --> 13:02.409
He was 13. It was nearly a year
till he come out.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.568
It would help our inquiry
if you could tell us

13:04.600 --> 13:08.207
why you made a complaint about
Chief Superintendent Fairbank.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.403
Well, Greg would never talk
about what had happened.

13:11.440 --> 13:14.922
We never talked much, anyway,
after he got took away from me.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.850
He blamed me
for what had happened.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.882
What had happened'?

13:21.040 --> 13:25.409
He said he'd been...
interfered with.

13:25.440 --> 13:27.363
A big fat bloke, he said.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.370
So I went to the police.
They didn't want to know.

13:30.400 --> 13:34.121
They said
Greg wasn't a reliable witness.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.003
So I told them
if they didn't do nothing,

13:36.040 --> 13:38.202
I was gonna write to the papers
and my MP.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.088
They just laughed in my face.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.929
And that was that'?

13:43.760 --> 13:44.966
No.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.082
A week after,
one of them come round and said

13:47.120 --> 13:50.567
this Chief Superintendent
had sorted it.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.930
Who came round?
A uniformed officer'?

13:54.960 --> 13:56.291
Yeah.

13:56.320 --> 14:00.006
He said the Chief Superintendent
had got the bloke to confess

14:00.040 --> 14:01.530
and that it was all all right,

14:01.560 --> 14:04.450
so that Greg wouldn't have
to go through a trial and that.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.289
To be clear, Mrs Rider...

14:06.320 --> 14:08.926
you were advised that the
offender was going to prison?

14:08.960 --> 14:10.291
Yeah.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.527
But then there was this picture
in the paper,

14:12.560 --> 14:14.881
and Greg said
it was the same bloke.

14:16.720 --> 14:19.690
Mrs Rider, is this the man
you saw in the paper?

14:21.960 --> 14:23.450
Yeah.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.847
And then you realised
he hadn't been charged?

14:25.880 --> 14:30.568
Huh. Well, I'd written down the
name of the Chief Superintendent

14:30.600 --> 14:33.331
who was supposed
to have taken care of it all.

14:33.360 --> 14:34.930
- (Knocking)
- Yeah'?

14:34.960 --> 14:36.530
Sir, we've got a witness
claiming

14:36.560 --> 14:38.688
Fairbank suppressed
a child rape allegation

14:38.720 --> 14:40.643
against Dale Roach.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.969
Ideally, sir,
we'd put this to Fairbank

14:44.000 --> 14:45.490
in the presence of a solicitor.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.884
Well,
I'll have to think about that.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.046
- But...
- Steve...

14:54.280 --> 14:56.282
- Sir.
- Kate.

15:05.720 --> 15:06.881
Sir, with respect,

15:06.920 --> 15:10.447
there's no operational reason
to drag our feet over Fairbank.

15:10.480 --> 15:13.404
I know how to conduct
an anti-corruption case, Steve.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.204
With respect again,
I'm concerned

15:15.240 --> 15:16.890
this inquiry's
dragging its feet.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.686
- I'm not the issue here, son.
- Sir'?

15:21.720 --> 15:23.768
I can't have you
interviewing Fairbank

15:23.800 --> 15:26.804
because of the suspicions
hanging over your head.

15:26.840 --> 15:29.286
That's why we're dragging
our feet here.

15:29.320 --> 15:32.051
Still this crap
about me planting evidence'?

15:32.080 --> 15:34.811
I can't have you in the room
with Fairbank. I will not risk

15:34.840 --> 15:36.604
jeopardising
future prosecutions.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.803
- You're taking me off the case'?
- Don't make this any harder.

15:39.840 --> 15:42.730
What, harder than protecting
a former Chief Super and Mason?

15:42.760 --> 15:45.206
- You are way out of line.
- I saw your handshake.

15:45.240 --> 15:46.526
You do not know a thing...

15:46.560 --> 15:48.050
I know you want me off a case

15:48.080 --> 15:50.321
that involves officers
covering up child abuse!

15:50.360 --> 15:54.365
The suspicions against you
are more than planting evidence.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.044
As you were.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.129
Superintendent Hastings and I
have had a short discussion.

16:15.160 --> 16:19.165
In the circumstances, we
agree the best course of action,

16:19.200 --> 16:23.524
to protect all parties and to
abide by disciplinary procedure,

16:23.560 --> 16:27.201
is for you to be served
with a Regulation 15 notice

16:27.240 --> 16:30.005
and to be suspended until
these matters can be addressed

16:30.040 --> 16:33.044
at a formal
disciplinary hearing.

16:33.080 --> 16:36.209
A Reg 15'? For what'?

16:37.000 --> 16:39.401
Certain allegations
have been made against you.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.647
- By who'?
- It wouldn't be appropriate

16:41.680 --> 16:46.561
to discuss these outside
the disciplinary framework.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.604
But before you go, may I ask
if you're bearing a firearm'?

16:54.560 --> 16:56.688
Did this come from Dot'?

16:57.960 --> 17:00.566
- I want him in here.
- That's not a good idea.

17:02.280 --> 17:03.645
Fine.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.123
I really don't think
that's a good idea.

17:07.160 --> 17:11.529
My officer has asked for this,
so I'm gonna give him this.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.561
(Opens door)

17:17.680 --> 17:18.840
DI Cottan.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.762
Sir. Gill.

17:38.560 --> 17:41.928
- The floor is yours.
- What's this all about?

17:44.040 --> 17:45.610
DI Cottan.

17:45.640 --> 17:49.486
I'm concerned about DS Arnott's
professional conduct.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.682
He's been bearing a firearm
around the office.

17:51.720 --> 17:54.121
In contravention
of the 1968 Firearms Act.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.162
I've signed the firearm back in.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.568
He's accused of an improper
relationship with a suspect,

17:59.600 --> 18:02.126
of planting evidence
against said suspect.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.686
- I did not plant evidence!
- He also fits the profile

18:04.720 --> 18:07.769
of a suspect in a separate
anti-corruption inquiry.

18:07.800 --> 18:11.691
What'? This is insane!
What anti-corruption inquiry'?

18:11.720 --> 18:14.405
I don't think any more should
be said about this matter.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.488
For Christ's sake,
I'm not the problem here!

18:18.160 --> 18:19.889
What exactly are you saying?

18:19.920 --> 18:22.526
Sir, I've got serious concerns

18:22.560 --> 18:25.723
about DI Cottan's performance
under Police Conduct regs.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.444
That's why he's
having a go at me.

18:27.480 --> 18:29.562
Sir, this is completely
out of order.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.921
During a search
of Danny Waldron's flat,

18:31.960 --> 18:34.327
he failed to order
the necessary forensics.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.681
He then induced a junior rank
to hide this from me

18:36.720 --> 18:39.371
so I wouldn't find out
he'd missed a crucial lead.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.165
If there's any issues
to be addressed by a review,

18:42.200 --> 18:44.601
then trust me
there certainly will be.

18:44.640 --> 18:47.723
However, said issues
are separate and distinct

18:47.760 --> 18:50.127
from the ones before us now,
DS Arnott.

18:50.160 --> 18:53.209
Look. Please...

18:54.840 --> 18:56.649
I know I've pissed you all off.

18:56.680 --> 18:59.160
And I am sorry
about the undercover on Denton.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.487
But I am the only one
trying to solve this case!

19:01.520 --> 19:05.241
Oh, so only Steve can solve
the case! All hail Steve.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.726
I think we should stop
this conversation now.

19:07.760 --> 19:09.762
- Thank you, DI Cottan.
- Sir.

19:13.240 --> 19:16.528
GILL: Thanks for keeping your
cool. Can't have been easy.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.001
(Door closes)

19:21.640 --> 19:23.529
(Sighs)

19:23.560 --> 19:27.326
DS Arnott,
regarding the Reg 15 notice...

19:27.360 --> 19:29.203
You will return here
for an interview

19:29.240 --> 19:31.402
at a time specified by us.

19:31.440 --> 19:35.365
But until then, you will be
suspended. I'm sorry, son.

19:36.480 --> 19:40.530
(Tearfully) I know he's got
his reasons, but you, sir'?

19:42.400 --> 19:45.290
What about my point about you
and Fairbank and the Masons?

19:45.320 --> 19:47.800
Come on. You're not doing
yourself any favours.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.683
It's one thing
denying allegations,

19:49.720 --> 19:52.200
but it's another thing
slinging mud at superiors.

19:52.240 --> 19:55.961
That's a different kettle
of fish, fella. What can I say'?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.401
You've let me down,
you've let yourself down.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.124
Yeah. Well, you're the one

20:00.160 --> 20:02.401
that fed us all a doctored file
on Ronan Murphy.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.802
What'?

20:05.840 --> 20:08.810
Ronan Murphy being a criminal
associate of Tommy Hunter...

20:10.240 --> 20:12.208
...not in the file.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.242
Ronan Murphy being investigated

20:14.280 --> 20:16.169
as a suspect
in Hunter's murder...

20:16.200 --> 20:17.725
not in the file.

20:17.760 --> 20:20.491
Ronan Murphy and Tommy Hunter
both being involved

20:20.520 --> 20:23.364
in child sexual exploitation...
not in the file.

20:25.480 --> 20:28.165
And you say I'm the one
that's letting you down.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.684
Sir.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.522
Are you OK'?

20:57.560 --> 21:00.404
Yeah. I'm not gonna
jump to conclusions.

21:00.440 --> 21:03.011
Let's see what comes out
of his disciplinary hearing.

21:09.240 --> 21:11.208
Look, just between us,

21:11.240 --> 21:13.846
I've got a lead on him planting
that money at Lindsay's.

21:14.920 --> 21:18.163
I just wanted to let you know,
so it didn't come as a shock.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.601
And I know
this is going to be difficult...

21:22.160 --> 21:24.891
...but we've got to keep
an eye on his every move.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.764
Sorry.

21:44.120 --> 21:45.246
All right'?

21:47.080 --> 21:48.923
Thought these
might cheer you up.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.769
Come in.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.323
They're sweet,
but you didn't need to.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.408
No, you're all right.

22:07.560 --> 22:11.724
Kate...I’d be gutted if this
Steve stuff came between us.

22:13.120 --> 22:16.567
This feels like a bit
of a second chance for me...

22:17.920 --> 22:19.524
...and I don't want
to mess it up.

22:25.160 --> 22:27.401
- Oh, OK.
- No.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.727
It's just...let's take it slow.
You know.

22:29.760 --> 22:32.331
Yeah, yeah, of course.

22:32.360 --> 22:35.603
- With the regs and that.
- Sure.

22:35.640 --> 22:38.803
- But thanks. These are lovely.
- I'm glad you like them.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.447
- Well, I'd best be off.
- All right. Night.

22:43.480 --> 22:45.084
Night.

22:47.880 --> 22:49.882
(Door opens and closes)

23:04.960 --> 23:06.450
<i>How can I help you?</i>

23:07.520 --> 23:11.206
I'm requesting authorisation
on an undercover operation.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.801
That's Ted Hastings' call,
not mine.

23:16.440 --> 23:19.728
Well, actually, ma'am, it'd be
against a fellow AC-l 2 officer.

23:19.760 --> 23:20.886
Ah.

23:20.920 --> 23:23.321
The guidelines are
that I should approach

23:23.360 --> 23:25.647
an independent
anti-corruption commander

23:25.680 --> 23:27.842
for said authorisation.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.325
Why me'?

23:30.320 --> 23:31.810
I'd rather not say, ma'am.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.445
JAG-Q's nearer.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.131
Like I say,
I'd rather not say, ma'am.

23:41.480 --> 23:44.245
Because I'm a woman.
I can't be a Mason.

24:05.960 --> 24:07.962
You kept me waiting.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.284
I know.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.764
I've been watching for an hour.

24:13.960 --> 24:16.884
If you'll hang en fer that long,
then you must be desperate.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.844
It's funny. The last time we
met, I was the desperate one,

24:20.880 --> 24:22.291
and you held all the cards.

24:22.320 --> 24:23.970
Well, you don't hold them now.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.729
Don't I'? You know what, Steve?

24:25.760 --> 24:28.809
I've deduced
that you are so desperate

24:28.840 --> 24:31.764
that you need help
from some sad cow with no life.

24:31.800 --> 24:34.883
(Chuckles) Silly me.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.525
Wait.

24:49.840 --> 24:53.162
There's something I've never
said, and I want to say it now.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.849
I'm sorry.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.528
I did take advantage of you.

24:59.840 --> 25:03.083
You were grieving.
You were alone.

25:03.120 --> 25:06.010
And gaining your trust,
albeit to solve a crime,

25:06.040 --> 25:08.202
was callous and insensitive.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.368
I'm sorry for what I did.

25:11.560 --> 25:14.131
And you might not believe me,
but that night...

25:14.880 --> 25:16.405
That's what made me hold back.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.128
Don't flatter yourself, Steve.

25:21.160 --> 25:23.401
I might have been
a complete emotional wreck,

25:23.440 --> 25:25.010
but I didn't want you.

25:26.880 --> 25:29.121
We were just two lonely people
having a fumble.

25:29.160 --> 25:31.208
It might have sounded
convincing on tape,

25:31.240 --> 25:33.641
but it was empty
and it was pathetic.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.004
Back to planting of evidence.

25:40.880 --> 25:43.326
The accusations been around
so long, people think

25:43.360 --> 25:44.964
they don't have to prove it.

25:45.960 --> 25:48.281
Instead,
it's down to me to disprove it.

25:48.320 --> 25:52.370
You know the truth.
You know I didn't do it.

25:53.240 --> 25:54.969
Listen to me...

26:03.040 --> 26:07.364
I've just spent a year
and a half of my life in prison.

26:08.080 --> 26:11.209
I've lost everything. My home.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.968
My lob.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.287
My whole future.

26:18.680 --> 26:21.809
Maybe now you've got a taste
of what it's like

26:21.840 --> 26:23.922
to know that you're innocent

26:23.960 --> 26:28.204
and yet still have
your whole life destroyed.

26:36.080 --> 26:39.562
Look, I'll help you find
the real criminals, Steve.

26:40.480 --> 26:45.042
But I will never ever spend
one more day in prison.

26:45.080 --> 26:47.082
So, let me be clear.

26:47.920 --> 26:52.767
That money was put in my house
to frame me.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.208
I am innocent.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.811
lam the victim in all of this.

26:58.840 --> 27:00.330
- You're unbelievable.
- No.

27:01.840 --> 27:04.241
No, I want justice.

27:04.280 --> 27:06.931
And I don't care
how unjustly I get it.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.567
So, why don't you just tell me
everything you know

27:11.600 --> 27:13.329
about the case
that you're working on

27:13.360 --> 27:15.442
and how it connects to mine'?

27:15.480 --> 27:16.606
You must be joking.

27:16.640 --> 27:19.166
Right now I'm the only person
that can help you.

27:21.960 --> 27:23.564
(Footsteps)

27:24.360 --> 27:27.807
Hi, Ted. What's
with all the cloak-and-dagger'?

27:27.840 --> 27:30.684
I wanted to ask, off the record,
if I can count on your support

27:30.720 --> 27:33.849
in investigating former
Chief Superintendent Fairbank.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.291
In respect of...'?

27:35.320 --> 27:37.527
In respect
of not adequately investigating

27:37.560 --> 27:40.530
complaints
of child sexual exploitation.

27:41.520 --> 27:44.729
- Absolutely. Absolutely.
- Thanks.

27:46.120 --> 27:48.600
Ted, doesn't it make
much more sense

27:48.640 --> 27:51.211
to hand over your files
to the various authorities

27:51.240 --> 27:55.131
carrying out official inquiries
into historic sex abuse?

27:55.160 --> 27:57.003
You can do it through me,
if you like.

27:57.040 --> 27:59.850
Yeah, that would be great.
Thank you, Gill. Yeah, thanks.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.882
Thanks, Ted.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.043
We got seats
at the Pavilion End,

28:06.080 --> 28:07.570
behind the bowler's arm.

28:07.600 --> 28:10.729
And I'm thinking, you know,
"We're set for the day here."

28:10.760 --> 28:13.889
And then what happened'?
Heavens opened.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.289
Ted!

28:17.720 --> 28:19.324
I'm sure
there's no need for this,

28:19.360 --> 28:21.328
over a little misunderstanding.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.124
We can thrash this out,
the pair of us.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.288
I think it's best
to continue as planned,

28:25.320 --> 28:28.244
just to make sure
that everythings above board.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.282
- I'm in your hands.
- Tea'? Coffee'?

28:30.320 --> 28:33.483
- Very nice. Coffee. Thanks.
- Great.

28:48.120 --> 28:49.884
HASTINGS:
<i>You are being interviewed</i>

28:49.920 --> 28:53.163
<i>in respect of suspicion
of misconduct in public office.</i>

28:53.200 --> 28:54.406
<i>You don't have to say anything.</i>

28:54.440 --> 28:55.965
<i>However,
it may harm your defence</i>

28:56.000 --> 28:57.604
<i>if you fail to mention something
under questioning</i>

28:57.640 --> 29:00.120
<i>that you later go on
to rely on in court,</i>

29:00.160 --> 29:02.288
<i>and anything you do say

29:02.320 --> 29:05.290
- Been there, done that.
- Thank you.

29:05.320 --> 29:07.607
Document 2 in your folders.

29:07.640 --> 29:10.450
Document 2 is a photocopy
of a missing-persons report

29:10.480 --> 29:13.211
relating to
Oliver Stephens-Lloyd.

29:13.240 --> 29:16.050
You were shown this photocopy
in your interview on July 7th.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.969
It's from near on 20 years ago.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.846
- You don't recall the report'?
- I don't recall the report.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.608
If you could go
to the end of the report.

29:24.640 --> 29:27.120
You were shown that some
individuals were copied in

29:27.160 --> 29:29.527
by the senior
investigating officer.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.927
I'll have to put my...
glasses on.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.649
Right...

29:36.400 --> 29:39.165
You were shown that, according
to the distribution list,

29:39.200 --> 29:42.170
you were sent a copy
of this report in November '98.

29:42.200 --> 29:44.726
Yeah. Seems I was sent one.

29:44.760 --> 29:47.047
God knows whether I got it
or read it. (Chuckles)

29:47.080 --> 29:50.209
During this time, November '98,
what was your position?

29:50.240 --> 29:51.651
- I ran Vice.
- Yeah.

29:51.680 --> 29:54.604
And why were you sent a report
on a missing social worker'?

29:54.640 --> 29:58.804
I have absolutely no idea.
lt sounds like an admin error.

29:59.440 --> 30:01.204
An administrative error'?

30:01.240 --> 30:04.847
Well, I'm surmising.
I've no idea. Sorry.

30:07.760 --> 30:09.762
<i>Document 3 in your folders.</i>

30:09.800 --> 30:14.203
Document 3 is a photocopy of
a report dated 21 November '98,

30:14.240 --> 30:17.130
on death by suicide
of Oliver Stephens-Lloyd.

30:18.080 --> 30:20.765
He claimed to have furnished you
with a list of names

30:20.800 --> 30:22.404
of abusers at Sands View.

30:22.440 --> 30:25.410
Shortly afterwards, he was
dismissed from his position,

30:25.440 --> 30:28.171
and three months later
he was found dead.

30:29.040 --> 30:32.567
I don't know anything about
a list or about this poor fella.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.762
The Murder Squad
have reopened the inquiry

30:34.800 --> 30:37.724
into the death
of Oliver Stephens-Lloyd.

30:37.760 --> 30:39.524
Right.

30:39.560 --> 30:43.804
Well, now, Ted,
this is...getting serious.

30:43.840 --> 30:46.161
<i>HASTINGS: This is also
an opportunity to clarify</i>

30:46.200 --> 30:48.328
<i>some issues that are causing
some vexation.</i>

30:48.360 --> 30:51.921
- Well, you know I want to help.
- And we're very grateful.

30:51.960 --> 30:54.850
Document 5 is a recent
postmortem examination

30:54.880 --> 30:56.530
from the Home Office
pathologist.

30:56.560 --> 30:59.609
It's likely that Stephens-Lloyd
was struck over the head

30:59.640 --> 31:02.405
with a blunt instrument
and then thrown into the river.

31:02.440 --> 31:05.842
So, not suicide. Murder.

31:05.880 --> 31:09.009
Well, I can see
why you're troubled, Ted,

31:09.040 --> 31:12.487
but my department was not
involved in that investigation.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.170
Well, we interviewed
the officers

31:14.200 --> 31:16.441
who carried out
this investigation.

31:17.160 --> 31:19.083
Murder Squad
obtained a statement

31:19.120 --> 31:21.168
from an officer
who was a DC at the time,

31:21.200 --> 31:23.521
stating that the senior
investigating officer,

31:23.560 --> 31:24.721
DI Marcus Thurwell,

31:24.760 --> 31:26.808
advised him
the death was suicide

31:26.840 --> 31:30.561
and anything that didn't fit
should be kept to themselves.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.409
Now, why would Thurwell
be so eager

31:33.440 --> 31:35.442
to prove that it was a suicide?

31:36.720 --> 31:38.961
I haven't the foggiest.

31:41.080 --> 31:43.401
Do you recall the name
Wendy Rider?

31:43.440 --> 31:47.331
Well, I think we all know by now
that I'm hopeless with names.

31:47.360 --> 31:49.601
Wendy Rider
lodged a complaint against you

31:49.640 --> 31:51.847
in respect of her son,
Gregory Rider.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.926
Gregory was a resident
at Sands View Boys' Home

31:54.960 --> 31:57.531
and was allegedly abused
by your best mate Dale Roach.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.005
Right, Ted. Now, this was meant
to be a friendly conversation.

32:03.040 --> 32:06.203
But your DC, whatever her name
is, has just struck a tone

32:06.240 --> 32:08.208
that I don't warm to.

32:09.120 --> 32:10.849
DC Fleming.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.689
My apologies
if I've caused offence.

32:12.720 --> 32:15.246
We are most grateful
for your cooperation, sir.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.601
I knew Councillor Roach
from a distance,

32:17.640 --> 32:19.642
a very great distance.

32:20.880 --> 32:24.965
Going back to your interview
with us on July 7th, you stated,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.401
"These things
would have been looked into."

32:27.440 --> 32:28.930
Do you stand by that statement?

32:28.960 --> 32:31.247
Well, I must've said it
if you've written it down.

32:31.280 --> 32:35.365
Can you inform us how you
investigated the allegations

32:35.400 --> 32:38.483
made by Mrs Rider
against Dale Roach?

32:38.520 --> 32:41.046
- It'll be in the files.
- We looked. It's not.

32:41.080 --> 32:43.447
I was Chief Superintendent,
not the office boy.

32:43.480 --> 32:45.960
If records are missing,
that's nothing to do with me.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.321
Mrs Rider says
that she was informed

32:48.360 --> 32:50.647
that you carried out
this interview yourself,

32:50.680 --> 32:52.603
and that no charge resulted.

32:52.640 --> 32:54.051
Well, that must be because

32:54.080 --> 32:56.731
the allegations against Dale
proved groundless.

32:56.760 --> 32:59.764
- "Dale"?
- Councillor Roach.

33:00.560 --> 33:04.042
Why did you not keep
any records of this'?

33:04.080 --> 33:07.209
Here we go again. I was Chief...

33:07.240 --> 33:11.006
Superintendent. Yeah, I knew,
but this was your department,

33:11.040 --> 33:13.168
and this was
a very serious allegation

33:13.200 --> 33:15.646
against a prominent,
you know, public individual.

33:15.680 --> 33:17.762
I can't think of any reason
in the world

33:17.800 --> 33:20.531
why you wouldn't have wanted
to be across this yourself,

33:20.560 --> 33:23.848
and why there is no record
of the investigation.

33:23.880 --> 33:26.201
Unless
there was no investigation.

33:26.240 --> 33:28.641
Unless you were sweeping
all this under the carpet

33:28.680 --> 33:31.160
to protect your friend.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.924
<i>Did any of the boys
at Sands View</i>

33:37.960 --> 33:39.564
complain about sexual abuse

33:39.600 --> 33:42.285
to you or any of the officers
you knew of'?

33:42.320 --> 33:44.766
God, no. Absolutely not.

33:44.800 --> 33:48.691
- You would have investigated?
- Correct. 100% correct.

33:50.760 --> 33:54.048
You and your solicitor
have a written request

33:54.080 --> 33:57.607
from a police inspector,
independent of this inquiry,

33:57.640 --> 33:59.881
and prior
to this voluntary interview,

33:59.920 --> 34:03.686
requesting your participation in
a video identification process.

34:03.720 --> 34:07.042
Mr Fairbank is reluctant
to submit himself to a process

34:07.080 --> 34:11.688
dependent on what must by now be
extremely unreliable memories.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.004
OK.

34:17.600 --> 34:18.806
DC Fleming.

34:18.840 --> 34:21.969
Item reference ASJ-76

34:22.000 --> 34:25.607
is a newspaper cutting
dated 14 March, '97.

34:25.639 --> 34:27.369
Do you recognise this image'?

34:27.400 --> 34:29.607
It's me and Councillor Roach.

34:29.639 --> 34:32.007
What was your connection
with the charity?

34:32.040 --> 34:34.440
Well, I'd be there,
at his invitation, if he thought

34:34.480 --> 34:36.447
there was
a crime-prevention angle.

34:36.480 --> 34:39.723
Keeping young lads this side
of the law...sort of thing.

34:40.880 --> 34:43.884
Item reference ASJ-116.

34:47.719 --> 34:52.442
ASJ-116 is a newspaper clipping
dated <i>7</i> August, 1995.

34:53.320 --> 34:56.688
For the tape, I am showing the
interviewee a copy of this item.

34:56.719 --> 34:58.688
Do you recognise the man
in this photo

34:58.720 --> 35:00.688
with you
and Councillor Dale Roach?

35:00.720 --> 35:03.087
I think we all do.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.407
And was he involved
in the charities, too'?

35:05.440 --> 35:07.602
I believe so. Some of them, yes.

35:07.640 --> 35:10.803
So,
in addition to the complaints

35:10.840 --> 35:12.649
made about
Councillor Dale Roach,

35:12.680 --> 35:16.366
were there any other complaints
about prominent individuals

35:16.400 --> 35:19.370
involved in sexual assaults
on young people'?

35:19.400 --> 35:21.402
Not that I recall.

35:22.360 --> 35:26.490
Right. Because, according to our
colleagues in Operation Yewtree,

35:26.520 --> 35:28.170
there were numerous complaints,

35:28.200 --> 35:31.409
and according to our colleagues
in Operation Midland,

35:31.440 --> 35:33.886
there were numerous complaints.

35:33.920 --> 35:37.402
So, why did you not investigate
any of these?

35:37.440 --> 35:41.047
I don't recall
any specific investigations.

35:41.080 --> 35:43.242
We know there were complaints.

35:43.280 --> 35:45.044
You were meant
to investigate them,

35:45.080 --> 35:48.641
and on <i>7</i> July you confessed
that you investigated them.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.364
I must sound like
a stuck record,

35:50.400 --> 35:52.687
but I honestly don't remember.

35:52.720 --> 35:54.131
It's the honest truth.

35:55.040 --> 35:58.249
Were you under pressure
to turn a blind eye'?

35:59.800 --> 36:01.484
I don't know how you mean, Ted.

36:01.520 --> 36:06.003
From executive officers
or political interests?

36:06.040 --> 36:08.202
What's put that idea
in your head'?

36:08.240 --> 36:11.642
What we have here is Dale Roach
interfering with young boys.

36:11.680 --> 36:14.160
Now, call me a cynic,
but he's a politician,

36:14.200 --> 36:16.362
and they are all born liars.

36:16.400 --> 36:18.164
Then we have
this celebrity up here,

36:18.200 --> 36:21.682
and we all know show business
people have very low morals.

36:21.720 --> 36:23.882
But you were a police officer.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.602
<i>A Chief Superintendent.</i>

36:34.120 --> 36:40.571
I really want to help, Ted, but
I don't see what more I can say.

36:40.600 --> 36:43.410
May I ask, how far
are we going with this today?

36:43.440 --> 36:46.489
Do you have any evidence
to put to Mr Fairbank'?

36:48.440 --> 36:51.683
No, this is voluntary. He's just
helping us with our inquiries.

36:51.720 --> 36:54.041
I'm sorry
that I can't fill in the blanks,

36:54.080 --> 36:55.809
but I'm not as sharp as I was.

36:55.840 --> 36:58.002
So you keep saying.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.442
<i>FLEMING: Interview terminated.</i>

37:02.400 --> 37:06.291
Anything else I can do...
don't hesitate to ask.

37:08.840 --> 37:11.241
CCTV showed Danny Waldron
arriving here early,

37:11.280 --> 37:13.726
the morning
after he killed Linus Murphy.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.762
He came in from that direction,

37:15.800 --> 37:17.529
deposited evidence
in a container

37:17.560 --> 37:19.210
and then left in that direction.

37:19.240 --> 37:21.447
- The way back to his flat'?
- Yeah.

37:22.320 --> 37:25.642
He laid a trail for us to find
if anything happened to him.

37:25.680 --> 37:28.729
There was an envelope addressed
to me, but it was empty.

37:28.760 --> 37:30.649
Forensics suggest
it contained a note

37:30.680 --> 37:32.887
written immediately
after the murder.

37:32.920 --> 37:35.366
I believe Danny got information
out of Linus Murphy

37:35.400 --> 37:37.767
that enabled him
to compile a list of abusers.

37:38.760 --> 37:40.922
If Danny wrote the list
when he was with Linus,

37:40.960 --> 37:42.769
he must have had it
when he left here.

37:44.040 --> 37:45.724
If that was me,

37:45.760 --> 37:48.161
I'd take the opportunity
to recce a safe spot,

37:48.200 --> 37:51.010
and then hide the list,
or a backup copy,

37:51.040 --> 37:53.008
that night,
under the cover of darkness.

37:54.560 --> 37:56.403
Trust me.

37:58.080 --> 38:00.367
Well, you know
all about concealing evidence.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.129
I mean,
you had to hide 50 grand.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.842
That's not what happened at all.

38:17.520 --> 38:19.249
FLEMING:
My God. He's with Denton.

38:19.280 --> 38:21.601
See, the pair of them
are in it together.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.847
See, I told you
we had to watch his every move.

38:26.880 --> 38:30.009
They're retracing Danny's steps.
Why'?

38:36.600 --> 38:38.887
Danny's flat is just over
on the next street.

38:38.920 --> 38:41.161
Any further
and he risked being spotted.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.002
I think I know what he did.

39:12.720 --> 39:15.963
- (Knocking)
- Gill.

39:17.280 --> 39:21.410
You decided to proceed with
questioning Patrick Fairbank'?

39:21.440 --> 39:23.966
Yeah. I decided to put the man
on the spot myself,

39:24.000 --> 39:26.287
rather than turn it ever
to some ether department.

39:26.320 --> 39:30.006
- There's conflict of interest.
- How, exactly?

39:30.040 --> 39:32.407
Your affiliation with Fairbank.

39:32.440 --> 39:34.442
I've never put
my personal loyalties

39:34.480 --> 39:36.482
above my professional duty.

39:36.520 --> 39:38.443
You're being naive.
I'm not referring

39:38.480 --> 39:40.960
to any ordinary relationship.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.247
What will it look like
if Fairbank slips any inquiry

39:44.280 --> 39:47.170
and then it's revealed that
the senior investigating officer

39:47.200 --> 39:49.885
is pan of the same
closed organisation?

39:49.920 --> 39:52.446
What organisation
are you talking about?

39:53.400 --> 39:56.131
Secret handshakes,
bare trouser legs.

39:57.480 --> 40:00.927
Whatever you're alluding to, I
am not at liberty to discuss it.

40:00.960 --> 40:03.440
No doubt Dale Roach
was pan of the same lodge.

40:03.480 --> 40:07.007
We can't have it appear
that you're protecting Fairbank.

40:07.040 --> 40:08.644
Protecting him'?

40:08.680 --> 40:11.604
I'm doing my level best
to investigate him!

40:11.640 --> 40:13.881
There's crossover
with other inquiries.

40:13.920 --> 40:17.447
Politically, it would be
expedient to hand over our files

40:17.480 --> 40:19.528
and let Midland and Yewtree
run with it.

40:19.560 --> 40:22.211
I have been informed
of systematic depravity

40:22.240 --> 40:25.528
against children
who were wards of the state

40:25.560 --> 40:28.848
by high-ranking officials
of the state.

40:28.880 --> 40:33.169
Now, how much money are we going
to spend chasing clapped-out DJs

40:33.200 --> 40:35.726
when the people
who knew about this depravity

40:35.760 --> 40:39.048
and/or turned a blind eye to it
and/or were involved in it

40:39.080 --> 40:41.242
are using that power
to cover their tracks'?

40:41.280 --> 40:45.649
Individuals, I might add, Gill,
who appointed you.

40:46.760 --> 40:48.000
That's absurd.

40:48.040 --> 40:49.565
Is it?

40:52.320 --> 40:53.970
Is it, really?

40:54.000 --> 40:55.968
Thank you for this file.

40:58.040 --> 41:01.442
Perhaps you could help me
understand why it was doctored.

41:02.280 --> 41:03.770
I'm sorry?

41:03.800 --> 41:05.882
Doctored.

41:05.920 --> 41:07.922
And it was you, Gill...

41:08.720 --> 41:11.326
...who brought me this file...

41:11.360 --> 41:14.204
with crucial pieces
of information omitted.

41:15.600 --> 41:18.001
I can't explain
how that happened.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.042
Well, I can explain it to you.

41:20.720 --> 41:23.405
It happened because it was known
that behind

41:23.440 --> 41:26.091
the seemingly lawful killing
of a violent criminal

41:26.120 --> 41:28.361
there lay a dark secret.

41:29.040 --> 41:32.522
Probably the darkest secret
in our society today.

41:33.960 --> 41:37.601
So, are you going to advise me
who provided you with that file'?

41:38.480 --> 41:40.289
Are you doing this on purpose,
Ted'?

41:40.320 --> 41:42.322
- Doing what'?
- Sophisticated adults

41:42.360 --> 41:44.806
are perfectly capable
of working effectively,

41:44.840 --> 41:46.683
despite personal intimacy,

41:46.720 --> 41:49.371
but clearly you're not
a sophisticated adult.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.402
Clearly, I'm not.

41:51.440 --> 41:54.649
I only see black and white,
with no grey areas in between...

41:55.360 --> 41:57.840
...and anything
that happened between us...

41:57.880 --> 42:00.770
Well, it was a mistake, and we
just have to put it behind us.

42:00.800 --> 42:05.283
You're right. It was a mistake.
But not the biggest you've made.

42:15.520 --> 42:17.682
All we found on our recce
was a churchyard.

42:18.960 --> 42:21.964
Quiet. Secluded. Plenty
of places to hide something.

42:22.760 --> 42:24.728
The only problem
that Danny faced

42:24.760 --> 42:27.969
was finding the exact spot
that he had hidden his list,

42:28.000 --> 42:32.244
days, weeks
or possibly even months later.

42:32.280 --> 42:34.282
(Door opens)

42:40.000 --> 42:41.445
What's going on here'?

42:42.160 --> 42:44.561
- We're...
- Searching burial records.

42:57.720 --> 43:00.166
- Her'?
- We needed a place to work.

43:00.200 --> 43:02.806
- In our home'?
- We're searching for evidence.

43:02.840 --> 43:04.444
- Really?
- She's pieced together

43:04.480 --> 43:06.130
how Danny Waldron's mind
worked.

43:06.160 --> 43:08.288
She's had experience
of avoiding coppers.

43:11.440 --> 43:13.329
I'm desperate.

43:18.760 --> 43:20.808
I'm going to get petrol
and some chocolate.

43:20.840 --> 43:22.842
When I come back,
she'd better be gone.

43:33.440 --> 43:35.442
(Door closes)

43:40.720 --> 43:42.768
What was the name
of the boys' home, again'?

43:43.600 --> 43:45.489
Sands View.

43:48.160 --> 43:50.845
Plot 121: Lenora Sands.

43:52.880 --> 43:55.326
- I'm going alone.
- Steve, don't.

44:01.360 --> 44:03.203
- Need a lift'?
- No.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.527
I'll call you
if I find anything.

44:06.400 --> 44:08.687
COTTAN: They're splitting up.

44:09.640 --> 44:11.085
You take Steve.

44:15.240 --> 44:16.730
(Engine starts)

45:09.880 --> 45:11.882
(Phone ringing)

45:13.600 --> 45:16.410
- DC Fleming.
- Kate, it's me.

45:16.440 --> 45:20.570
Look, Lindsay looked like she'd
led Steve on a wild-goose chase.

45:21.680 --> 45:23.045
Poor bastard.

45:23.080 --> 45:25.526
<i>Yeah, well, don't you feel
loo sorry for him.</i>

45:25.560 --> 45:27.369
<i>Why?</i>

45:27.400 --> 45:30.768
That lead on Steve. It looks
like it's gonna pan out.

45:30.800 --> 45:33.371
<i>He really did plant that money
at Lindsay's.</i>

45:35.320 --> 45:36.810
I'm sorry.

45:36.840 --> 45:40.162
I thought you'd want to know
before it's common knowledge.

45:41.440 --> 45:43.442
Yeah. Thanks.

45:44.840 --> 45:46.444
Sorry.

46:19.960 --> 46:21.405
Kate'?

46:22.440 --> 46:24.090
You were following me'?

46:24.120 --> 46:26.964
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for the list.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.844
For Christ's sake, Steve.
Whatever's going on

46:29.880 --> 46:32.281
between you and Lindsay,
I don't give a shit any more.

46:32.320 --> 46:35.210
Danny was onto something, and
I'm trying to solve this case.

46:35.240 --> 46:38.084
You're not solving anything.
Lindsay's making a tit of you.

46:38.120 --> 46:40.282
You and your new partner
deserve each other.

46:40.320 --> 46:44.006
- What's that supposed to mean'?
- There's no list here, Steve.

46:44.040 --> 46:46.327
Then Lindsay's gonna get
what's coming.

46:46.360 --> 46:48.169
Well, she's not the only one.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.651
I trusted you. We were partners.

47:15.360 --> 47:17.488
(Clatter and whir of machines)

47:18.680 --> 47:20.250
He's on the first machine.

47:20.280 --> 47:22.282
Thanks.

47:23.040 --> 47:27.045
- Hi, Joe. DC Fleming.
- Yeah, I remember.

47:27.080 --> 47:28.764
I need you
to look at some material

47:28.800 --> 47:30.723
from our inquiry
into Sands View -

47:30.760 --> 47:33.969
photos of individuals of
a certain age and appearance -

47:34.000 --> 47:35.889
to see if one
could be the police officer

47:35.920 --> 47:38.002
you or the other lads
made a complaint to.

47:40.640 --> 47:42.210
OK. Well, show us them, then.

47:43.080 --> 47:46.402
Sorry. There are strict rules
on photographic identification.

47:48.320 --> 47:51.130
You'll need to accompany me
to a police station.

47:54.680 --> 47:56.682
(Women chatting)

48:08.720 --> 48:14.841
DI Denton. Did this man
come in here, early one morning,

48:14.880 --> 48:16.882
about two months ago?

48:21.880 --> 48:23.882
- I'd have to check.
- Great.

48:25.040 --> 48:27.930
I'm looking at <i>7</i> June,
around 8am.

48:55.560 --> 48:57.562
(Retching)

49:03.120 --> 49:07.489
Joe, what is it'? Joe'? It's OK.

49:07.520 --> 49:09.727
It's OK.

49:09.760 --> 49:11.762
- (Sobs)
- OK.

49:25.080 --> 49:28.050
- All right'?
- Oh, I'm fine, thanks.

49:57.200 --> 49:58.770
(Typing)

51:18.480 --> 51:20.289
Steve?

51:27.480 --> 51:30.768
Only me. Lindsay Denton,
I'm arresting you on suspicion

51:30.800 --> 51:33.007
of impersonating
a police officer.

51:33.040 --> 51:37.284
As you're on licence, that means
prison. What a crying shame.

51:37.320 --> 51:39.766
No. Just wait. Wait.

51:42.400 --> 51:44.368
Listen. Right?

51:44.400 --> 51:46.050
Don't take me
to a police station.

51:46.080 --> 51:50.130
I request AC-t 2.
I'm gonna make a statement.

51:50.160 --> 51:51.650
No skin off my nose.

51:51.680 --> 51:54.570
I thought it was Steve's car -
till I saw the registration.

51:54.600 --> 51:56.364
Yeah, well,
my Ferrari's in the shop,

51:56.400 --> 51:59.529
so I had to get a car-pool job
with the rest of the rabble.

52:02.480 --> 52:05.450
No back roads.
Just stick to the main drag.

52:05.480 --> 52:08.165
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
put my hand on your knee,

52:08.200 --> 52:10.089
if that's what you think.

52:16.440 --> 52:19.410
So, what's all this big news
you've got for us, then'?

52:20.840 --> 52:22.842
All in good time.

52:24.560 --> 52:26.961
(Tyres screeching
and horn honking)

52:27.000 --> 52:28.843
I said no back roads.

52:28.880 --> 52:31.850
Change of plan.
Nearest station's Polk Avenue.

52:31.880 --> 52:35.282
They can charge you for
impersonating a police officer.

52:36.080 --> 52:38.287
That's you back inside. End of.

52:41.040 --> 52:42.849
OK, listen.

52:44.280 --> 52:46.044
I found Danny Waldron's list.

52:47.880 --> 52:50.645
The VIPs who were abusing boys
at Sands View.

52:51.800 --> 52:53.086
How did you manage that'?

52:53.120 --> 52:56.169
It didn't make sense for Danny
to make a hard copy of the list

52:56.200 --> 52:59.329
that could be lost or destroyed.
He'd make an on-line copy.

52:59.360 --> 53:01.089
You'd have seized his computers.

53:01.120 --> 53:02.485
Yeah, obviously.

53:02.520 --> 53:04.807
He'd use a device
that couldn't be traced to him,

53:04.840 --> 53:07.525
and I spotted an internet café
just off his route home.

53:07.560 --> 53:09.164
He used a webcam
on a computer

53:09.200 --> 53:11.362
to capture an image
of the original list.

53:11.400 --> 53:14.244
So, how did you manage
to crack his passwords and that'?

53:14.280 --> 53:18.330
You'd harvested his user-names
and passwords on his phone,

53:18.360 --> 53:20.806
computer and on-line accounts.
They're on here.

53:20.840 --> 53:24.083
Fortunately, people recycle
user-names and passwords.

53:24.120 --> 53:28.170
How did you manage to find his
email? We looked everywhere.

53:28.200 --> 53:31.921
Danny was smart enough to keep
the email only as a draft.

53:31.960 --> 53:34.645
If it isn't sent,
it can't be traced.

53:36.160 --> 53:38.003
Thought of everything,
haven't you'?

53:38.040 --> 53:40.042
I have, indeed.

53:41.040 --> 53:42.724
I deleted Danny's draft.

53:43.640 --> 53:45.642
The only place that list exists

53:45.680 --> 53:48.490
is as a draft
in my email account.

53:49.360 --> 53:53.081
So, you take me to AC-12
and I'll hand it over.

53:53.120 --> 53:55.282
At a price, naturally.

53:56.120 --> 53:57.531
What price would that be'?

53:57.560 --> 54:01.087
My convictions quashed.
A full pardon.

54:02.520 --> 54:05.524
A clean slate? A fresh start?

54:06.240 --> 54:09.801
- Are you making fun of me'?
- Actually, I wasn't.

54:10.520 --> 54:12.443
You just take me to AC-12.
All right'?

54:17.720 --> 54:21.850
You know what'? Don't worry.
I'm gonna call them myself.

54:21.880 --> 54:23.882
Look, AC-12 want nothing
to do with you.

54:23.920 --> 54:25.410
They just want you in prison.

54:25.440 --> 54:27.727
What, you're different somehow,
are you'?

54:30.400 --> 54:32.607
I know you took that bribe,
Lindsay.

54:33.400 --> 54:35.402
But you didn't do it
for the money, did you'?

54:36.320 --> 54:40.041
You took it because you wanted
to find a young girl...

54:40.080 --> 54:42.845
who was being groomed
by Hunter and his cronies.

54:45.600 --> 54:48.365
- How do you know that'?
- 50 grand the first time.

54:49.120 --> 54:51.282
100 grand this time?

54:52.280 --> 54:54.521
- What?
- Face facts, Lindsay.

54:54.560 --> 54:56.562
Your old life'?

54:57.400 --> 54:59.243
No. That's a pipe dream.

54:59.280 --> 55:01.123
It's gone.

55:01.160 --> 55:02.969
Yeah, it's sad.

55:03.840 --> 55:06.002
The only way
you can get a fresh start...

55:06.880 --> 55:09.326
Well, do I have to spell it out'?

55:09.360 --> 55:13.160
100 grand, and you forget about
all of this. That list included.

55:15.040 --> 55:17.646
All you have to do
is forget about everything.

55:18.360 --> 55:20.362
All of this.

55:23.800 --> 55:26.121
Take the money, you mad bitch,
and stay out of it!

55:30.280 --> 55:31.486
What are you doing'?

55:33.560 --> 55:35.164
Why don't you
just take the money'?

55:35.200 --> 55:37.168
Because I'm a police officer!

55:38.080 --> 55:40.082
(Tyres screeching)

55:54.960 --> 56:00.285
DI Cottan, we are two feet apart
in a confined space.

56:01.600 --> 56:06.162
Frankly, for you,
this is a forensic ground-zero.

56:11.200 --> 56:12.804
Don't do that.

56:14.040 --> 56:18.682
You had four, five people
killed, and me framed.

56:18.720 --> 56:21.769
I expect you had Danny Waldron
killed, too.

56:21.800 --> 56:25.361
And never a single speck
of blood on your hands.

56:29.160 --> 56:30.605
You want to shoot me'?

56:32.600 --> 56:33.761
You go ahead.

56:35.400 --> 56:38.290
If it sends you to prison,
that is my job done.

56:40.080 --> 56:42.606
Do not send that message.

56:45.400 --> 56:47.402
You're just a gar-between.

56:48.280 --> 56:49.850
You're a weasel.

56:51.320 --> 56:53.721
Other people do your dirty work
for you.

56:56.040 --> 56:57.963
Now, you put that gun away.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.049
You take me to AC-12.

57:03.760 --> 57:06.081
Let's see what they all think
when I bring you in.

57:07.560 --> 57:09.927
- When I bring in the Caddy.
- (Bleep)

57:24.320 --> 57:25.731
No.

57:26.240 --> 57:27.730
No!
