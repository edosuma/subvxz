<i>Previously on</i> Jonas LA...

00:02.500 --> 00:03.959
I know I'm your chaperone this summer,

00:04.041 --> 00:07.458
but remember, I'm the cool aunt, OK?
You can tell me anything.

00:07.542 --> 00:10.375
-Stella's gonna date Joe from Jonas.
-What?!

00:10.458 --> 00:11.542
I'm calling your mom.

00:11.625 --> 00:12.959
Hi, Mona.

00:13.625 --> 00:15.834
You just pop up all over the place,
don't you?

00:15.917 --> 00:18.125
You said that you'd tell me
the secret of being a director.

00:18.208 --> 00:21.083
Just do it.

00:21.166 --> 00:22.333
Just go out and do it.

00:24.166 --> 00:27.709
Mr. Hug-snuggle? Do you feel like
something or someone is watching us?

00:27.792 --> 00:29.166
[screaming]

00:33.125 --> 00:35.250
I think we overdid it last night.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.792
After the fourth slice of pizza,
it's all just a blur.

00:37.875 --> 00:39.417
Dude, when one of us
breaks up with a girl,

00:39.500 --> 00:40.417
we all break up with a girl.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.959
I guess Vanessa and I
just weren't meant to be.

00:45.083 --> 00:47.417
-Did you just step in chili?
-I knew I left it somewhere.

00:50.375 --> 00:51.792
Morning, boys.

00:51.875 --> 00:53.792
Oh, hey, Dad.
Hey, Frankie.

00:53.875 --> 00:55.834
Dad, Frankie!

00:56.709 --> 00:58.625
What are you doing here?

00:59.667 --> 01:03.333
Uh, Joe, I never thought
I would say these words to you,

01:03.417 --> 01:05.792
but are you standing in chili?

01:08.917 --> 01:10.291
Yeah.

Oh! Oh, your mom
won't let me eat these.

02:12.375 --> 02:14.166
Oh, cheddar blasted!

02:14.250 --> 02:17.250
Dad, we're actually doing great.
I'm actually starring in a movie.

02:17.625 --> 02:19.542
Wait, are you guys
starring in a movie, too? I forget.

02:19.625 --> 02:21.750
No, we're all just extras in
<i>The Joe Show.</i>

02:21.834 --> 02:24.375
Look, I know you guys are doing
cool things this summer,

02:24.458 --> 02:26.834
but it's time to get back
to the music, all right?

02:26.917 --> 02:29.542
-Ideas, go!
-We can put some new songs online.

02:29.625 --> 02:32.125
-Play some shows.
-We should do a new music video.

02:32.208 --> 02:34.709
Music video, I like it.

02:34.792 --> 02:36.125
[exclaims]
Hey!

02:36.667 --> 02:38.166
Ah, Macy!

02:38.250 --> 02:39.959
You guys didn't tell us
your dad was coming.

02:40.041 --> 02:42.041
-Hey, how are you?
-Hi, sweetie, how are you?

02:42.125 --> 02:43.750
-Good.
-Hey, what about me?

02:43.834 --> 02:47.792
-Frankie.
-Look at you all handsome and grown up.

02:47.875 --> 02:49.792
-Really?
-[chuckles]

02:50.709 --> 02:54.250
All right, band meeting, two hours.
Ready, break!

02:55.083 --> 02:58.250
-Are we supposed to follow him?
-I don't know.

02:58.333 --> 03:01.709
Yeah, uh, I don't know where I'm going.
Can I set up shop somewhere?

03:01.792 --> 03:03.667
-We'll show you.
-OK.

03:04.166 --> 03:06.917
Hey, Frankie, do you want
to hang with your dad

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
while I make some exciting business calls?

03:10.083 --> 03:12.417
You guys have a lot of work to do.
Stella and I can watch Frankie.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.000
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

03:14.083 --> 03:16.417
Thank you, girls.
Frankie, behave yourself.

03:17.917 --> 03:19.792
-[sneezes]
-What was that?

03:19.875 --> 03:20.834
Nothing.

03:21.458 --> 03:23.083
[sniffles]
That was nothing.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.333
[groans] I don't know what happened.
It came on so fast.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.333
I'll tell you what's not gonna happen:

03:31.417 --> 03:33.750
you're not gonna leave this room
or get near me or anyone else

03:33.834 --> 03:34.792
with those icky germs.

03:34.875 --> 03:36.750
Yeah, but you have to take
care of Frankie.

03:36.834 --> 03:38.875
So, that means
it's just gonna be me and--

03:38.959 --> 03:42.625
Ohh!
My sick widdle Stella-bell.

03:42.709 --> 03:46.250
-Hi, Aunt Lisa.
-OK, feel better.

03:46.333 --> 03:48.291
Don't sneeze on my toothbrush.

03:49.083 --> 03:50.875
Who likes jigsaw puzzles?

03:50.959 --> 03:53.583
-Yay...
-It's gonna be so fun!

03:53.667 --> 03:56.250
We got Per Chance.
This one is so fun.

03:56.333 --> 03:58.125
And when you were a kid,
you loved Dopey Doctor.

04:01.083 --> 04:02.917
Hey, Mace, can I run something by you?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.875
Have you talked to, touched or been near
Stella in the last hour?

04:05.959 --> 04:07.583
-No.
-OK, shoot.

04:07.667 --> 04:10.000
OK, so we're doing this new music video,

04:10.083 --> 04:12.375
but I was thinking maybe
I would direct it.

04:12.458 --> 04:14.709
Wow, that's awesome.
I think you should definitely go for it.

04:14.792 --> 04:17.000
It's just that our dad
usually makes these decisions.

04:17.083 --> 04:18.875
Well, I'm sure he'll support you.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.917
This could be the start
of something really big for me.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.250
I know.
And you'll be a great director.

04:23.333 --> 04:26.750
Now can you say that same exact thing,
just in a lower tone and act like my dad?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.250
[low voice]
Kevin, you're a great director.

04:30.333 --> 04:32.542
Aw, thanks, Dad.
That means a lot.

04:32.625 --> 04:34.125
You're welcome, son.

04:34.208 --> 04:35.709
[normal voice]
Now, can I run something by you?

04:35.792 --> 04:36.625
Yeah, shoot.

04:36.709 --> 04:38.750
What's the best way to handle
your little brother?

04:38.834 --> 04:42.959
Uh, let him play guitar, write songs,
do what he usually does.

04:43.041 --> 04:45.083
Are you guys OK?
Are you arguing about something?

04:45.166 --> 04:47.125
What?
No, not Nick. [chuckles]

04:47.208 --> 04:49.375
-Frankie.
-Oh, oh.

04:49.458 --> 04:54.250
Um, cookies when he's good
and noogies when he's bad.

04:54.333 --> 04:55.792
-Thanks, dude.
-No worries.

04:55.875 --> 04:58.417
Oh, and the other one
works on Nick, too.

05:00.625 --> 05:03.417
-Hey, Macy.
-Frankie!

05:03.959 --> 05:06.625
-What are you all dressed up for?
-You.

05:06.709 --> 05:08.291
Me?

05:09.792 --> 05:11.250
Oh!

05:11.333 --> 05:15.166
Wow. Ha!
OK...

05:16.083 --> 05:19.834
You know what I loved
to play when I was a kid your age?

05:19.917 --> 05:22.834
-We're not that far apart.
-Oh, but we are.

05:22.917 --> 05:26.375
Yeah, you know, we got
some board games or card games.

05:26.458 --> 05:29.000
What I'm trying to say
is I've got mad games.

05:30.333 --> 05:32.291
Lady's choice.

05:33.417 --> 05:37.208
Ahh... yay.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.291
OK, guys, band meeting!

05:40.625 --> 05:42.250
Where's Kevin? Kevin!

05:42.333 --> 05:45.291
-Sorry, had to get my book.
-Oh, good, you're gonna take notes.

05:45.375 --> 05:46.917
Actually, I have something
to talk to you guys about.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.375
Can it wait for just a minute?
Because I have got some amazing news.

05:50.458 --> 05:53.625
Wow, Dad, I haven't seen you this excited
since we gave you that universal remote.

05:53.709 --> 05:56.667
Oh, Uni!
He turned everything on.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.750
All right, are you ready?

05:59.834 --> 06:05.208
I have hired a director for your video.
And not just any director.

06:05.291 --> 06:08.083
-Boys, I got McP.
-McP?

06:08.166 --> 06:10.083
The bad-boy genius?

06:10.166 --> 06:14.125
-His last video got like a zillion hits.
-Well, you know my Hug-snuggle video?

06:14.208 --> 06:16.625
-It's doing really well, too.
-Yeah, and it's cute,

06:16.709 --> 06:19.875
but back to business.
We are meeting with him tomorrow.

06:19.959 --> 06:20.875
Everyone psyched?

06:20.959 --> 06:22.083
-Totally.
-It's awesome.

06:22.166 --> 06:23.750
[chuckles]
Come here.

06:23.834 --> 06:25.834
Let me show you this for real.

06:25.917 --> 06:28.917
-Yeah, there's McP.
-[Joe] Awesome.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.041
-[Dad laughs]
-Look at that, Lady Gaga.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.625
It's gonna be incredible.

06:33.333 --> 06:35.834
Look what Auntie "Wisa" has for you!

06:35.917 --> 06:38.083
-Ohh.
-Thank you.

06:38.166 --> 06:40.083
Why are you talking to me
like I'm a baby?

06:40.166 --> 06:43.458
I'm not, silly.
I'm talking to you like you're a cat.

06:43.542 --> 06:48.000
Awesome. Um... so do you want me
to just lap this up then, or...?

06:48.083 --> 06:51.375
-Oh, sorry.
-Thanks.

06:51.458 --> 06:52.917
You know, the only thing
that makes me

06:53.000 --> 06:54.500
feel better when I'm sick
is hot chicken soup.

06:54.583 --> 06:57.500
Aw, then you're gonna love
my not-chicken soup.

06:57.583 --> 07:01.041
No poultry was harmed
in the making of this. Mm-hmm.

07:02.542 --> 07:05.041
-What's in this?
-Uh, tofu mash,

07:05.125 --> 07:07.667
ooh, rendered nut barley
and boiled turnips.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.542
Mmm, take a whiff.

07:09.625 --> 07:11.250
Yeah.

07:12.166 --> 07:13.709
-[gags]
-Mmm.

07:13.792 --> 07:16.000
-That smells healthy.
-[soft chuckle]

07:16.083 --> 07:18.166
Um, you know,
could I get another blanket?

07:18.250 --> 07:21.792
Oh, absolutely. And, remember,
somewhere a chicken is saying,

07:21.875 --> 07:25.750
"Thank you, Stella,
for not putting me in a pot." [clucks]

07:28.500 --> 07:32.333
You're welcome, chickens.
Sorry, plant.

07:37.041 --> 07:39.625
We really appreciate you
squeezing us in, McP.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.083
-Couldn't be more excited.
-Oh, I know you're excited.

07:42.166 --> 07:43.000
I'm excited, too.

07:43.083 --> 07:46.208
OK? But excitement is not
going to get this video made.

07:46.291 --> 07:47.959
Want to know what's gonna
get this video made?

07:48.041 --> 07:50.375
Not excitement?

07:50.458 --> 07:53.917
No, it's commitment and vision
and genius.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.500
-You know who's got all that?
-You do.

07:55.583 --> 07:58.875
Exactly. And that's really
why I am where I am in this business.

07:58.959 --> 08:00.583
In your bedroom?

08:01.166 --> 08:03.625
It's temporary.
Where were you at 16?

08:03.709 --> 08:05.750
-The Grammys.
-OK.

08:05.834 --> 08:07.792
Well, now you're working
with McP, all right?

08:07.875 --> 08:09.875
And I define cool.

08:09.959 --> 08:12.166
-[woman] Phillip!
-Mom?

08:12.250 --> 08:15.417
-I'm in a meeting.
-[Mom] Do your friends want tuna fish?

08:15.500 --> 08:17.667
No! Gosh!

08:17.750 --> 08:20.083
Actually, tuna fish sounds kinda nice.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.291
OK, anyways, with me you're gonna get
three things, all right?

08:23.375 --> 08:25.000
You're gonna get heat,
you're gonna get exposure,

08:25.083 --> 08:27.500
and you're gonna get street cred
in places that don't even have streets.

08:27.583 --> 08:30.750
-[Mom] Phillip!
-Mom, it's McP, McP!

08:30.834 --> 08:33.333
-[Mom] Are you wearing your retainer?
-[groans]

08:33.417 --> 08:35.041
I cannot live like this anymore.

08:35.125 --> 08:37.834
-You know, McP, if this is a bad time--
-No! No, no, no, no.

08:37.917 --> 08:40.041
I heard the song.
I love the song.

08:40.125 --> 08:42.041
All right, the concept hit me
like a bolt of lightning.

08:42.125 --> 08:44.959
Now, here's what I'm thinking...

08:45.041 --> 08:47.208
[pop music playing]

09:00.041 --> 09:02.250
No, no, cut.
Cut the music. Cut it.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.917
Guys, what's the problem here?
Hmm?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.375
What's... your... problem?

09:11.917 --> 09:15.333
McP, I don't think your concept
really fits our music.

09:16.375 --> 09:18.291
Yeah, and these latex suits
are super sweaty.

09:18.375 --> 09:20.375
You guys, it's called a vision.

09:20.458 --> 09:22.250
OK? You know what?
Where's your dad?

09:22.333 --> 09:24.333
He gets me.
Unlike my own father.

09:24.417 --> 09:26.041
You know,
can we just have a minute, please?

09:26.125 --> 09:29.750
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
I'll just update my status.

09:30.583 --> 09:32.542
-You do that.
-This is bad.

09:32.625 --> 09:34.083
I should have spoken up
when I had the chance.

09:34.166 --> 09:35.166
What are you talking about?

09:35.250 --> 09:37.625
-I wanted to direct this video all along.
-You did?

09:37.709 --> 09:40.375
-Yeah, I had an idea and everything.
-Why didn't you tell us?

09:40.458 --> 09:44.166
Well, I wanted to, but then Dad
hired Mr. McMama's boy over there.

09:45.041 --> 09:46.208
What are we gonna do?

09:46.291 --> 09:48.834
We made a commitment.
We have to follow through on it.

09:48.917 --> 09:50.834
Well, then I guess we're gonna...

09:50.917 --> 09:52.250
[chuckles]

09:52.333 --> 09:54.250
Finally.
All right, now here are your dance steps.

09:54.333 --> 09:57.375
Got this idea when I saw a four-year-old
freaking out at a supermarket.

09:57.458 --> 09:59.834
OK, OK, he wasn't four,
he was 16 and it was me.

09:59.917 --> 10:01.709
But watch and learn.

10:02.125 --> 10:05.041
[beatboxing]

10:14.083 --> 10:15.166
Do it.

10:19.834 --> 10:22.667
-Oh, boy.
-Macy?

10:23.041 --> 10:25.375
Frankie!
Ohh.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.917
You got me flowers...
from the garden that I just planted.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.625
Thank you.
So, I hear you like cookies.

10:32.709 --> 10:34.709
-You know the way to my heart.
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

10:34.792 --> 10:37.875
Just your stomach.
Let's keep it at that. Ha-ha.

10:37.959 --> 10:40.041
I bet you have a lot
of girlfriends back home, huh?

10:40.125 --> 10:41.959
No one you need to worry about.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.041
OK, OK, you know what?

10:44.125 --> 10:46.458
Uh, I'm gonna be right back.
Why don't you just--

10:46.542 --> 10:48.333
Make you a macaroni necklace?

10:48.417 --> 10:50.750
I was gonna say have a juice box,
but sure.

10:53.125 --> 10:54.375

10:54.458 --> 10:56.959
"Oh, and then Boots was crying

10:57.041 --> 10:59.208
because he didn't want to go
to the veterinarian.

10:59.291 --> 11:02.458
But then his mom said,
'Listen, you have to go to the doctor.'"

11:02.542 --> 11:04.458
-[coughing]
-[Macy] Stella?

11:04.542 --> 11:06.875
Are you still sick?

11:07.375 --> 11:09.041
I'll take that as a yes.

11:09.125 --> 11:10.834
Macy, come in.

11:11.667 --> 11:14.375
OK, I have a problem.

11:14.458 --> 11:16.250
Frankie has a crush on me.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.083
[gasps]
Ooh, tell me all about the guy.

11:18.166 --> 11:20.166
-What does he drive?
-A bicycle?

11:20.250 --> 11:23.166
-He's ten.
-Oh, no.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.750
Oh, that's a very delicate age.

11:24.834 --> 11:26.792
-You have to let him down easy.
-I know.

11:26.875 --> 11:28.625
I tried, but he won't take a hint.

11:28.709 --> 11:30.625
Did you tell him that you're dating Nick?

11:30.709 --> 11:35.291
-Oh, right, your rock star.
-Aunt Lisa, Nick's a nice guy.

11:35.375 --> 11:37.542
Oh, yeah, right, like your rock star, huh?

11:37.625 --> 11:41.000
When will you girls learn?
Rock stars care about two things, OK?

11:41.083 --> 11:42.959
Themselves and their hair.

11:43.041 --> 11:43.917
You guys!

11:44.208 --> 11:46.500
Just tell him about Nick,
and I'm sure he'll back off.

11:47.417 --> 11:48.959
You're right.
You're right!

11:49.041 --> 11:51.208
I mean, he won't want
to compete with his brother.

11:51.291 --> 11:53.083
Problem solved.

11:54.041 --> 11:57.000
And if that doesn't work,
there's always the noogie option.

I know Dad hired this guy,

12:12.166 --> 12:14.125
-and we're trying to act professional--
-But this is not cool.

12:14.208 --> 12:16.500
OK, this punk needs some tough talking to.

[suit squeaks]
McP, this isn't working for us.

12:20.208 --> 12:24.208
Oh, no, well, that's too bad, you know,
because for me it's just terrific.

12:24.291 --> 12:27.583
-OK, no need for the sarcasm.
-Oh, I'm so sorry!

12:27.667 --> 12:29.291
-I'm sorry.
-All I'm saying is

12:29.375 --> 12:30.250
if we're gonna make this work,

12:30.333 --> 12:32.709
we need to find a concept
that works with our style.

12:32.792 --> 12:36.458
[snickers] Your style?
OK, and what exactly is that?

12:36.542 --> 12:38.500
-Not this!
-[gasps]

12:38.583 --> 12:42.667
Listen, if you're not smart enough
to get what I'm going for here,

12:42.750 --> 12:43.875
then you direct it.

12:45.333 --> 12:47.583
-I will!
-Yeah, I thought so.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.583
OK, everyone,
let's take it from the top.

12:52.959 --> 12:55.625
-What?
-You heard him. We have a new director.

12:55.709 --> 12:56.959
And you're fired.

12:57.041 --> 13:01.333
[scoffs] I'm fired?
I'm fired, huh? No one fires McP.

13:02.875 --> 13:05.583
-Oh, right, I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

13:05.667 --> 13:07.500
That's right, you're fired, Phillip.

13:15.250 --> 13:17.166
-It's your show now, bro.
-Thanks, man.

13:17.250 --> 13:19.291
I have a concept,
but I don't think this works for it.

13:19.375 --> 13:21.875
-Yeah, I would hope not.
-[Joe] Guys, I can't get this off.

13:22.709 --> 13:24.083
Guys, I can't get it off.

13:24.166 --> 13:25.709

Just calm... calm down.

13:27.333 --> 13:29.709

13:36.583 --> 13:38.375
[Frankie]
Mmm, oatmeal raisin.

13:38.458 --> 13:41.875
Yes, I thought we could
enjoy some together

13:41.959 --> 13:44.750
while you and I have a very
important conversation.

13:44.834 --> 13:47.291
Sure. Relationships are
all about communication.

13:47.375 --> 13:49.250
[chuckles]
Right.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.625
Frankie, I think you are
a very, very sweet kid.

13:53.709 --> 13:56.000
But I'm kind of going out with Nick.

13:56.083 --> 13:58.667
-I know.
-Wait, what, you know?

13:58.750 --> 14:01.750
-Everyone knows.
-Oh.

14:01.834 --> 14:04.291
So, then you also know
that I can't be your girlfriend.

14:04.375 --> 14:07.000
-Why not?
-Because Nick is your brother.

14:07.083 --> 14:09.333
Then may the best brother win.

14:10.208 --> 14:11.333
Frankie!

14:11.750 --> 14:13.458
You're making this really difficult.

14:13.542 --> 14:15.208
I mean, I don't know what else
to say except that--

14:15.291 --> 14:16.125
Ewww!

14:16.208 --> 14:18.709
-Are you OK?
-This is gross.

14:19.333 --> 14:22.041
-[scoffs] Well, that's just rude.
-I'm sorry, Macy,

14:22.125 --> 14:25.291
if you can't bake
a decent cookie, we're over.

14:25.375 --> 14:28.750
Frankie, come on!
How about some chocolate chip?

14:28.834 --> 14:30.792
Wait, what am I doing?

14:30.875 --> 14:33.166
I'm free.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.125
[groaning]

14:35.208 --> 14:37.041
That is terrible.

14:39.041 --> 14:41.375
All right, so the shot starts
over here with Nick and we're--

14:41.458 --> 14:44.166
Guys!
Band meeting, now.

14:44.875 --> 14:46.417
Just got a call from McP's mom.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.000
She said he is so upset
he won't come out of his office.

14:49.083 --> 14:50.917
-You mean his bedroom?
-Whatever.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.083
The point is I hired him.

14:53.166 --> 14:55.125
All right, and then what?
You guys fire him?

14:55.208 --> 14:58.333
I'm the manager, all right?
When it comes to the band,

14:58.417 --> 15:01.125
"we" always includes me.

15:01.208 --> 15:03.333
[sighs] You're right.
We should have included you.

15:03.417 --> 15:05.917
-We're sorry.
-Yeah, it's a little late now.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.917
-All right, who's directing this?
-[coughs] Kevin.

15:09.000 --> 15:09.875
Dude.

15:11.291 --> 15:13.375
That's the other thing that we decided.

15:13.458 --> 15:17.375
-I'm gonna direct it.
-You?

15:17.458 --> 15:20.583
Yeah, from the start
I always wanted to direct it.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.917
OK.

15:29.041 --> 15:31.291
-Show me what you got.
-Yes.

15:31.375 --> 15:33.208
All right, places everyone.

-I'll come and check on you later.

-Yeah?

-Stop!
-Get him!

21:04.333 --> 21:05.458

21:15.542 --> 21:17.208
He's like the greatest
music producer ever.

21:17.291 --> 21:19.583
-I'm ready to receive your music.
-Here you go.

21:19.667 --> 21:22.542

21:31.417 --> 21:33.917
Whoa, what?! <i>Boyfriend?</i>

21:34.000 --> 21:35.583

21:35.709 --> 21:37.959
-Is it Movie Brat?
-She posted something about you.

21:38.041 --> 21:39.041
Me?
