00:00.700 --> 00:02.434
<i>Previously on Hostages...</i>

00:02.436 --> 00:03.769
When are you speaking
with the Vice President?

00:03.771 --> 00:05.437
I'm on my way now.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.973
We're going to discuss potential running
mates for his presidential campaign.

00:07.975 --> 00:10.576
When I'm finished, you will
be at the top of his list.

00:10.578 --> 00:13.111
So you've made up your mind to run
when Kincaid's second term is up?

00:13.113 --> 00:16.681
The only question is, are
you interested in running?

00:18.483 --> 00:20.518
I have a business
proposition for you.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.921
I need a spy inside
Duncan's operation.

00:22.923 --> 00:24.822
What about the girl?
She accept your offer?

00:24.824 --> 00:26.024
She's in.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.892
The President is gonna be in
New York today.

00:27.894 --> 00:29.961
Another team is being assembled.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.828
Sir, I've got a hit on
Duncan Carlisle in New York.

00:31.830 --> 00:33.130
15 minutes ago.

00:33.132 --> 00:34.831
Son of a bitch.

00:34.833 --> 00:36.500
He's trying to sabotage
this whole thing.

00:41.206 --> 00:42.373
Targets are down.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.607
Copy that.

00:43.609 --> 00:45.008
I can't believe you did it.

00:45.010 --> 00:47.010
You came through for me, Ellen.

00:48.546 --> 00:50.013
Without you,

00:50.015 --> 00:52.148
I don't know what would
have happened today.

00:52.150 --> 00:53.016
Don't move!

01:10.934 --> 01:13.368
There's easier ways to get in
touch with me, Logan.

01:13.370 --> 01:15.638
Phone call, text,
send me an e-mail.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.039
We know what you did
in New York.

01:19.041 --> 01:20.809
People are very upset.

01:20.811 --> 01:22.310
I'm upset too, now what?

01:23.345 --> 01:24.678
Not my call.

01:36.158 --> 01:37.592
Agent Carlisle.

01:37.594 --> 01:39.093
We've never officially met.

01:40.394 --> 01:41.862
Thomas Blair.

01:52.440 --> 01:57.144
I'm aware of what you and
your team did in New York.

01:57.146 --> 01:59.579
And I'm aware of what you
and your team tried to do.

02:01.516 --> 02:02.915
Should've stayed out of it.

02:02.917 --> 02:05.185
If you had succeeded, that
would've made me expendable,

02:05.187 --> 02:07.154
and we both know
where that leads.

02:07.156 --> 02:08.354
You're smart.

02:08.357 --> 02:11.390
I'm also your best chance at
getting this thing done.

02:11.392 --> 02:12.825
We could still work together.

02:12.827 --> 02:14.393
You already failed once.

02:14.395 --> 02:16.362
Why should I believe you'll
succeed this time?

02:16.364 --> 02:18.197
Well, for starters,
I just took out

02:18.199 --> 02:20.299
your crackerjack sniper team.

02:36.049 --> 02:38.217
And you're confident Dr. Sanders
will come through for us?

02:38.219 --> 02:39.751
I'm positive.

02:39.753 --> 02:43.155
And you're confident you'll hold
up your end of the bargain?

02:43.157 --> 02:44.255
Dr. Sanders will need a

02:44.257 --> 02:46.191
certain amount of help
in the operating room.

02:48.828 --> 02:50.896
We need to talk about that.

02:50.898 --> 02:52.530
What the hell does that mean?

02:52.532 --> 02:54.199
A problem has come up.

02:55.367 --> 02:57.069
We need your help solving it.

03:13.118 --> 03:15.720
Eh... About last night...

03:16.822 --> 03:18.622
Right.

03:18.624 --> 03:22.559
I mean, everything's
been so confusing and...

03:22.561 --> 03:23.794
heightened.

03:25.630 --> 03:27.297
I know what I'm supposed to feel.

03:27.299 --> 03:29.133
I'm supposed to hate you.

03:29.135 --> 03:31.202
But, uh...

03:35.106 --> 03:36.240
I don't.

03:38.576 --> 03:40.009
I'm glad to hear that.

03:46.751 --> 03:50.720
Ellen, we can't.
We need to focus right now

03:50.722 --> 03:52.822
on what really matters,

03:54.324 --> 03:55.591
saving our families.

03:55.593 --> 03:56.726
Yeah.

04:00.831 --> 04:02.766
We're doing the right thing.

04:12.576 --> 04:15.210
I gotta head out. I just got
a call from a detective.

04:16.380 --> 04:17.613
About?

04:17.615 --> 04:19.548
The murder of that limo driver.

04:19.550 --> 04:20.983
One of the detectives
working on the case

04:20.985 --> 04:22.752
wants to talk to me about
Jake's testimony.

04:23.853 --> 04:25.387
What number did he call you on?

04:25.389 --> 04:29.825
My work number. Called my secretary
and she told me to call here.

04:29.827 --> 04:31.693
Check it yourself.

04:31.695 --> 04:33.162
Press redial.

04:35.298 --> 04:37.766
Do you really want the DC
police knocking on the door,

04:37.768 --> 04:39.334
asking where the hell I am?

04:41.170 --> 04:42.637
Archer will give you a ride.

05:03.458 --> 05:05.259
Burton, hey.

05:05.261 --> 05:07.461
I need you to check something out.

05:07.463 --> 05:08.796
Right away!

05:11.233 --> 05:13.066
I'd like to talk to Detective Hall.

05:13.068 --> 05:15.168
- Is he expecting you?
- No.

05:15.170 --> 05:16.804
What's it about?

05:17.839 --> 05:19.740
I'd rather talk to him directly.

05:19.742 --> 05:22.309
He's in court right now,
he should be back pretty soon.

05:23.845 --> 05:25.546
- Okay, I'll wait.
- Follow me.

05:31.785 --> 05:33.253
I thought we had a deal!

05:33.255 --> 05:35.355
We did, we still do.

05:35.357 --> 05:38.624
I gave you $10,000 as a gesture
of good faith and you screwed us.

05:38.626 --> 05:40.727
I told you I needed to
know where Duncan was,

05:40.729 --> 05:42.762
if he did anything out
of the ordinary.

05:42.764 --> 05:45.631
The man went to New York and
took out a team of assassins!

05:45.633 --> 05:48.501
Not only did you fail to warn us,
you went completely off line.

05:48.503 --> 05:51.070
Listen! Duncan ordered
me to shut off my phone.

05:51.072 --> 05:53.906
Then he had me and another guy
parked on a stake-out all day.

05:53.908 --> 05:58.678
If I tried to call you, my
cover would've been exposed.

05:58.680 --> 06:00.686
You're saying you had no
idea what he was up to?

06:00.750 --> 06:03.315
No. Not a clue, I swear.

06:05.051 --> 06:06.785
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

06:06.787 --> 06:11.656
To save your ass and live happily
ever after with your son in Canada.

06:11.658 --> 06:14.093
What do I have to do?

06:14.095 --> 06:16.795
When this operation is over,

06:16.797 --> 06:19.398
we're going to eliminate
a few loose ends.

06:20.867 --> 06:22.868
- A few?
- Three.

06:22.870 --> 06:25.437
Duncan, Archer and Kramer.

06:25.439 --> 06:27.506
Assuming you're on board,
of course.

06:27.508 --> 06:29.441
Otherwise,
the number would be four.

06:32.412 --> 06:33.879
I'm on board.

06:39.718 --> 06:41.685
Hey. Your lawyer's here.

06:45.857 --> 06:47.758
Hello, Brian.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.027
What are you doing?

06:51.163 --> 06:52.596
I'm here to help.

06:52.598 --> 06:54.998
This is a police station.
When that detective comes in here,

06:55.000 --> 06:58.702
I'm gonna tell him everything!
You can't stop me!

06:58.704 --> 07:02.740
You're right, but hopefully I can
convince you you're making a mistake.

07:02.742 --> 07:03.874
I doubt it.

07:06.978 --> 07:10.113
Patty Hearst,
she was taken hostage,

07:10.115 --> 07:12.349
locked in a closet,

07:12.351 --> 07:16.453
and after months of abuse,
her captors robbed a bank.

07:16.455 --> 07:20.157
Patty Hearst was caught,
on tape, helping them.

07:20.159 --> 07:23.293
She was tried for bank robbery,
and in spite of the fact that

07:23.295 --> 07:27.697
she was kidnapped and held against
her will, she was convicted.

07:27.699 --> 07:30.700
- Well, this is different.
- You're right, it's even worse.

07:30.702 --> 07:32.735
You're crazy!

07:32.737 --> 07:36.639
Your wife injected the
President with blood thinners,

07:36.641 --> 07:38.475
lied to the Secret Service.

07:38.477 --> 07:42.411
- Helped bury her friend...
- The police are going to believe us!

07:42.413 --> 07:43.612
Not you.

07:44.948 --> 07:46.582
- You think so?
- I know so.

07:55.125 --> 07:58.594
Tough to prove you're a victim,
when you're kissing the captor.

08:27.607 --> 08:30.176
Congratulations,
you've successfully doctored

08:30.178 --> 08:32.678
a photograph of
my wife kissing Duncan.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.280
No one's gonna think that's real.

08:36.383 --> 08:37.883
There's video, as well.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.219
It's real, Brian.

08:47.093 --> 08:48.694
How's it going?

08:48.696 --> 08:50.428
I'm Detective Hall.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.030
Hi.

08:54.133 --> 08:56.434
So, what can I do for you?

09:01.673 --> 09:04.075
Well, after, um,
consulting with my attorney,

09:04.077 --> 09:07.945
I realize that the information I was
about to disclose is inaccurate.

09:08.947 --> 09:10.148
Excuse me?

09:10.150 --> 09:12.817
Sorry for the inconvenience.
I made a mistake.

09:14.953 --> 09:16.253
I have nothing to say.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.629
Where have you been?
I've just been trying to call you.

09:24.631 --> 09:26.163
You kissed him?

09:26.165 --> 09:28.733
- What?
- I saw the photo, Ellen!

09:28.735 --> 09:30.700
Photo?
What are you talking about?

09:30.702 --> 09:33.470
I went to the DC Police Department,
I was gonna tell them what's going on.

09:33.472 --> 09:36.206
- What! You were gonna talk to the police?
- We need help, Ellen, okay?

09:36.208 --> 09:39.042
There's no other way out of this,
so yeah, I went to the police,

09:39.044 --> 09:42.646
and Burton Delaney was there and he
showed me a photograph of you and Duncan.

09:42.648 --> 09:43.680
Kissing.

09:45.617 --> 09:46.983
Is it real?

09:52.990 --> 09:54.157
Yeah.

09:54.159 --> 09:57.093
Yes, we kissed. Once.

09:57.095 --> 09:58.061
God.

10:00.765 --> 10:02.231
What the hell is wrong with you?

10:02.233 --> 10:05.301
I just, I was trying to
convince him that I...

10:05.303 --> 10:06.735
I was willing to cooperate.

10:06.737 --> 10:08.171
Oh, so, you kissed him?

10:08.173 --> 10:09.872
Is that what you're saying?

10:09.874 --> 10:13.942
I'm saying it just happened, okay.
I don't know why. It just did.

10:13.944 --> 10:16.078
I'm sorry, that's the honest truth.

10:16.080 --> 10:19.815
Look, I understand things
just happening, I do,

10:19.817 --> 10:21.817
but not with that son of a bitch!

10:21.819 --> 10:23.886
It's not what you think.

10:23.888 --> 10:25.353
What the hell does that mean?

10:28.825 --> 10:30.425
He's doing this to save his wife.

10:35.431 --> 10:36.631
Where's Sandrine?

10:36.633 --> 10:39.601
She went to see the lawyer
about her son.

10:39.603 --> 10:41.570
So, what's up?

10:41.572 --> 10:43.938
- Where you been?
- Talking to our partners.

10:43.940 --> 10:46.374
They know we took out
their hit team.

10:46.376 --> 10:47.576
They think, or they know?

10:47.578 --> 10:50.331
- Know.
- How?

10:50.366 --> 10:52.580
Let's just say these
guys have lots of resources.

10:52.582 --> 10:54.548
Good news is they don't
hold a grudge.

10:54.550 --> 10:57.885
The mission is still a go,
but there's one slight hiccup.

10:57.887 --> 11:00.154
A Secret Service agent
named Jack Cahill,

11:00.156 --> 11:02.423
has just been assigned to the
President's personal detail,

11:02.425 --> 11:04.291
and he's senior to our inside man.

11:04.293 --> 11:07.328
Which means, Logan won't have
operational control on the day.

11:07.330 --> 11:10.631
Exactly. Unless, we find
a way to remove Cahill.

11:10.633 --> 11:12.933
Not that easy to take out
a Secret Service agent.

11:12.935 --> 11:16.403
I didn't say we were gonna kill him.
I said, we need to remove him.

11:16.405 --> 11:18.171
I have a plan.

11:18.173 --> 11:19.906
Who cares why he's doing all this?

11:19.908 --> 11:21.375
The fact is he's doing it!

11:21.377 --> 11:24.111
And he's harming innocent
people in the process.

11:24.113 --> 11:27.413
To hell with his damn wife.
What makes her so special?

11:27.415 --> 11:30.951
- She's dying, he loves her.
- That doesn't justify killing someone.

11:30.953 --> 11:34.054
Well, the only person who was supposed
to die was Kincaid, that's it.

11:34.056 --> 11:37.457
Ellen, listen to yourself, "The
only person who was meant to die?"

11:37.459 --> 11:38.825
Like that's okay?

11:38.827 --> 11:40.426
Kincaid is a bad person...

11:40.428 --> 11:41.994
Says Duncan.

11:41.996 --> 11:43.696
Well, I believe him.

11:43.698 --> 11:47.166
I met with Nina's mom and she
confirmed everything. It's all true.

11:48.535 --> 11:51.304
Okay. Great.

11:51.306 --> 11:53.706
It's true.

11:53.708 --> 11:56.909
Kincaid's a monster, he's like, the
most horrible guy in the world,

11:56.911 --> 11:59.879
but that doesn't mean that
it's okay to kill him.

11:59.881 --> 12:04.850
And Duncan's wife being sick doesn't
entitle him to commit murder!

12:04.852 --> 12:09.889
Look, you know, I dunno,
life isn't fair. Okay?

12:09.891 --> 12:14.026
Good people die, bad people live.

12:14.028 --> 12:15.927
There's no rhyme, no reason,

12:15.929 --> 12:20.231
no justification, it's just

12:20.233 --> 12:21.700
the way it is.

12:25.505 --> 12:27.138
Well thank you, Colonel.

12:27.140 --> 12:29.874
I don't mean to impose, but I was
just in for a procurement meeting

12:29.876 --> 12:32.110
with one of the joint chiefs,
so I thought I'd stop by.

12:32.112 --> 12:33.577
No, I'm glad you did, Lyndon.

12:33.579 --> 12:35.746
So, how are things going?

12:35.748 --> 12:38.382
You know how it is.
Wars are won and lost over the long haul.

12:38.384 --> 12:40.018
Power is like business.

12:40.020 --> 12:44.422
Lots of ups and downs, you just wanna
make sure it all pays off in the end.

12:44.424 --> 12:47.058
Now, this most recent setback
has been a little disturbing.

12:47.060 --> 12:49.660
And my company made
substantial investments,

12:49.662 --> 12:52.830
with the understanding
that OTI would continue.

12:52.832 --> 12:56.367
It represents government
contracts worth billions to us.

12:56.369 --> 12:58.101
I have some good news
on that front.

12:58.103 --> 13:01.038
The President has decided to
wait a few weeks to expose it.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.807
That is good news.

13:04.809 --> 13:06.877
Happy to walk you through the
game plan, if you'd like?

13:06.879 --> 13:09.646
Oh, no. Details make me nervous.
I just wanna make sure that

13:09.648 --> 13:14.117
we are all heading in a direction
that is in our mutual best interest.

13:14.119 --> 13:19.189
Oh, I understand. Have faith.
The balance of power is shifting, soon.

13:19.191 --> 13:23.693
Oh, son. The balance of power
is always in the same place.

13:23.695 --> 13:25.428
Where the money is.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.539
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Thanks for calling.

13:37.540 --> 13:39.876
So, like I said on the phone,

13:39.878 --> 13:42.345
- I got some work for you.
- Great.

13:42.347 --> 13:47.350
This gig's a little different.
It requires discretion.

13:47.352 --> 13:50.253
Discretion costs extra.

13:50.255 --> 13:51.453
Not a problem.

13:59.930 --> 14:03.031
What the hell were you thinking,
going to the police?

14:03.033 --> 14:04.366
Screw you!

14:04.368 --> 14:06.268
You are minutes away from
signing your own death warrant.

14:07.837 --> 14:08.904
Go to hell.

14:08.906 --> 14:10.972
Three more days,
that's it, then we're gone.

14:10.974 --> 14:13.474
- Out of your lives forever.
- I don't believe a word you're saying.

14:13.476 --> 14:14.609
Your wife does.

14:14.611 --> 14:18.179
- Excuse me?
- Your wife. Ellen.

14:18.181 --> 14:19.915
She believed me.

14:19.917 --> 14:22.083
Don't you ever talk about my wife!

14:26.022 --> 14:27.388
I hope you burn in hell.

14:27.390 --> 14:28.989
I probably will.

14:28.991 --> 14:30.925
But, that won't change
a damn thing.

14:46.707 --> 14:49.709
How did it go with your lawyer?

14:49.711 --> 14:53.013
Good. He's trying to work
out a custody arrangement.

14:53.015 --> 14:54.233
It's not easy though,

14:54.284 --> 14:56.877
it's not like I can go to court
and talk about my stable career.

14:57.987 --> 15:02.675
- So, your lawyer, he's based here?
- Excuse me?

15:02.710 --> 15:05.325
Just wondering
since your son's in New York,

15:05.327 --> 15:07.561
thought you have
a New York attorney.

15:07.563 --> 15:09.830
You a family law expert, now?

15:09.832 --> 15:11.297
Just concerned about you.

15:13.100 --> 15:15.101
You worry too much.

15:15.103 --> 15:18.304
It's bad for the heart.

15:18.306 --> 15:24.377
You're right. Need to lighten up a little.
Relax, start doing yoga.

15:24.379 --> 15:25.911
Drinking chamomile tea.

15:39.759 --> 15:41.927
Getting homework done?

15:41.929 --> 15:47.666
Some, but, it's kinda hard to have
focus on calculus these days.

15:47.668 --> 15:50.902
This will all be over soon.

15:50.904 --> 15:56.141
Look, um, I need a phone, one that
can't be traced or listened to.

15:56.143 --> 15:58.477
You think you can borrow one,
from a friend?

16:00.980 --> 16:02.981
Mom said that
we need to cooperate,

16:02.983 --> 16:05.517
that everything's gonna be okay
if we just do what they say.

16:05.519 --> 16:07.218
I know what Mom said.

16:07.220 --> 16:11.255
But... Look, I need
to make a phone call.

16:11.257 --> 16:14.826
Your mother's doing what she thinks
is right and I respect that,

16:14.828 --> 16:18.830
but I think I know a way out of this
and I just gotta make a phone call.

16:18.832 --> 16:20.131
Can you help me out?

16:23.668 --> 16:25.336
Clear a path! Make way!

16:25.338 --> 16:26.603
Hang in there.

16:26.605 --> 16:28.239
Move, move, move.

16:28.241 --> 16:29.573
Excuse me!

16:29.575 --> 16:30.974
He can wait.

16:30.976 --> 16:33.010
This way,
the neurosurgeon is waiting.

16:35.013 --> 16:36.613
Hey, I got your page,
what have we got?

16:36.615 --> 16:38.349
Multiple gunshot wounds.
Chest and legs.

16:38.351 --> 16:40.450
He's losing a lot of blood.
We need to get him on the table.

16:40.452 --> 16:42.819
Take him to OR four,
we'll both scrub in.

16:55.832 --> 16:57.733
So, what are the specifics?

16:57.735 --> 17:00.303
These are the specifics.

17:01.372 --> 17:03.806
They're shaped charges.

17:03.808 --> 17:06.342
They're small, powerful,
and untraceable.

17:06.344 --> 17:08.743
I need you to attach one
to each vehicle.

17:09.846 --> 17:11.814
What about the detonators?

17:11.816 --> 17:14.617
I'll handle that.

17:14.618 --> 17:19.421
When the surgery is over, the team
is gonna split up and disappear.

17:19.423 --> 17:21.423
That's when the bombs are
gonna go off.

17:22.759 --> 17:24.159
I'll take care of it.

17:26.195 --> 17:27.696
Take care of it today.

17:57.037 --> 17:58.603
I met up with our girl.

17:58.605 --> 18:00.572
- All systems go.
- Good.

18:00.574 --> 18:03.575
But there's something else, D.

18:03.577 --> 18:06.344
It's about Sandrine.
I think she's playing us.

18:08.247 --> 18:09.748
What?

18:09.750 --> 18:12.617
She was acting suspicious,
so, I followed her today.

18:12.619 --> 18:14.018
Met a guy at the park.

18:14.020 --> 18:15.920
Car with government plates.

18:17.056 --> 18:18.256
I think she flipped.

18:20.359 --> 18:22.626
If she flipped, we'd
already be in prison.

18:22.628 --> 18:25.063
So, she isn't talking to
the Feds, who's that guy?

18:28.467 --> 18:29.968
What this guy look like?

18:29.970 --> 18:34.404
Like a fed. Tall, fit,
white, about 45.

18:36.441 --> 18:38.843
- Is this the man she was talking to?
- Yeah, that's him.

18:38.845 --> 18:40.845
On the right. Who is he?

18:44.248 --> 18:47.351
My contact at the Secret Service.

18:47.353 --> 18:48.818
Why the hell is she talking to him?

18:48.820 --> 18:50.854
That's a good question.

18:54.792 --> 18:56.659
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:04.702 --> 19:07.904
Okay, I think I've got the last
of the bleeders. How are you doing?

19:07.906 --> 19:09.238
Still closing holes.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.774
Looks like the bullet missed
his major arteries.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.309
He just might make it.

19:13.311 --> 19:15.277
Vitals are stabilizing.

19:16.747 --> 19:17.914
Hey, this is an operating room!

19:17.916 --> 19:19.448
Is that son of a bitch gonna live?

19:19.450 --> 19:22.485
- Sir, please step out of the room.
- My partner just died.

19:22.487 --> 19:24.920
Your patient shot him in the face.

19:24.922 --> 19:27.923
Just keep that in mind while you're
trying to save his sorry ass.

19:29.526 --> 19:31.227
What's going on?

19:31.229 --> 19:34.596
This guy ambushed two cops,
during a traffic stop.

19:34.598 --> 19:36.932
The one who got shot was
a young father.

19:36.934 --> 19:38.333
He just had his first kid.

19:51.981 --> 19:54.082
You need to be careful
around Sandrine.

19:56.252 --> 19:58.086
Come on, Duncan, I'm not a kid.

19:58.088 --> 20:00.755
I'm not worried about you
getting your heart broken.

20:00.757 --> 20:02.957
I'm saying you can't trust her.

20:02.959 --> 20:04.159
What are you talking about?

20:04.161 --> 20:05.427
She's a criminal.

20:05.429 --> 20:07.328
She plays by different rules.

20:07.330 --> 20:08.430
You don't know her.

20:08.432 --> 20:09.497
Neither do you.

20:14.369 --> 20:17.038
I think she might be
selling us out.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.906
To who?

20:18.908 --> 20:19.941
Logan.

20:26.882 --> 20:29.049
I don't buy that.
If she's selling us out,

20:29.051 --> 20:31.415
why'd she take out
that sniper team in New York?

20:31.454 --> 20:33.389
I don't know.

20:33.655 --> 20:35.799
In the meantime, I want you
to take her with you

20:35.875 --> 20:38.407
and watch a guy
named Steve Patterson.

20:38.442 --> 20:41.328
- What are we watching him for?
- Nothing.

20:41.330 --> 20:44.297
It's a fake mission, but if she
is working for the other side,

20:44.299 --> 20:46.099
word will get back to them.

20:48.069 --> 20:50.369
I wanna see if Sandrine
takes the bait.

20:57.678 --> 20:58.812
How you doing?

21:00.447 --> 21:02.081
Fine.

21:02.083 --> 21:03.782
Why?

21:03.784 --> 21:07.520
Just thought, after what happened in
New York, if you wanted to talk about it.

21:07.522 --> 21:09.288
There's nothing to talk about.

21:09.290 --> 21:10.923
I did what I had to do.

21:10.925 --> 21:12.658
If the two shooters had
the drop on me,

21:12.660 --> 21:15.128
they would've put a bullet
in my head in a heartbeat.

21:15.130 --> 21:17.129
That's how it works.

21:17.131 --> 21:18.396
Got it.

21:19.532 --> 21:22.901
Duncan wants us to scope
out this address.

21:26.205 --> 21:27.606
Who lives there?

21:27.608 --> 21:30.542
Some federal prosecutor.
His name is Steve Patterson.

21:31.711 --> 21:33.278
I'll get my gear.

21:44.691 --> 21:46.158
We're losing him,
what happened?

21:46.160 --> 21:47.659
I've got him all cleaned up here.

21:47.661 --> 21:49.494
I pulled out a bullet fragment that
was blocking his femoral vein,

21:49.496 --> 21:50.528
I can't stop the bleeding...

21:50.530 --> 21:53.264
Push one cc of epi.

21:53.266 --> 21:54.667
Close the bleeder, Lena.

21:54.669 --> 21:57.769
I'm trying, Ellen.
There's too much blood.

21:59.872 --> 22:01.673
I said epi now!

22:01.675 --> 22:03.541
He's gone, Ellen.

22:03.543 --> 22:05.076
There's nothing we can do.

22:06.844 --> 22:08.212
Okay, step out of the way.

22:08.214 --> 22:09.480
What are you doing?

22:09.482 --> 22:11.682
Expose the patient,
I need paddles.

22:16.421 --> 22:17.921
Clear!

22:17.923 --> 22:21.325
- There's too much damage.
- Just give me some space.

22:21.327 --> 22:23.226
Suction, roll of vicryl.

22:45.783 --> 22:46.949
You did it.

22:48.085 --> 22:49.185
I can't believe it!

22:52.155 --> 22:53.656
Close him up.

23:08.371 --> 23:09.772
You ready?

23:11.307 --> 23:13.508
Just throwing my bag in the back.

23:22.118 --> 23:24.753
Why are we staking out
this prosecutor?

23:24.755 --> 23:27.655
- It have to do with the limo driver?
- I don't know.

23:29.691 --> 23:32.108
I gotta be honest,
I can't forget that guy's face.

23:32.127 --> 23:34.232
I can't get it out of my mind.

23:35.163 --> 23:37.865
He was pointing a gun at me.

23:37.867 --> 23:39.667
You saved my life that night.

23:44.273 --> 23:45.339
Well,

23:46.808 --> 23:49.042
you'd do the same for me, right?

23:49.044 --> 23:50.443
Of course.

24:23.716 --> 24:24.849
Ellen?

24:28.554 --> 24:30.155
I didn't mean to...

24:31.490 --> 24:32.757
I thought he was dead.

24:33.859 --> 24:36.628
I certainly wasn't trying
to kill him.

24:36.630 --> 24:38.496
Well, you weren't trying
to save him either.

24:38.498 --> 24:41.733
Look, my hand aren't as good as yours.
I didn't think we could save him.

24:43.969 --> 24:47.338
Not to mention, the son of a bitch
is gonna die anyway.

24:47.340 --> 24:49.841
He's a cop killer, Ellen.
He's gonna get the death penalty...

24:49.843 --> 24:53.044
- What? That has nothing to do with us.
- I know. I was just saying...

24:53.046 --> 24:56.147
We're doctors.
Not judges, not jurors.

25:04.222 --> 25:05.456
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:25.276 --> 25:27.611
Still got the magic touch, huh?

25:27.613 --> 25:30.380
- What's cracking, D? How ya been?
- I'm good, how 'bout you?

25:30.382 --> 25:32.282
Can't complain, man.

25:32.284 --> 25:34.884
- Kids?
- Killin' it. Maggie's getting all A's,

25:34.886 --> 25:36.886
and Jack's playing football,
starting quarterback.

25:36.888 --> 25:40.523
- Just like his old man.
- Yeah. Except better, and smarter.

25:42.060 --> 25:44.260
Hey, thanks for meeting with
me on such short notice.

25:44.262 --> 25:45.428
I appreciate it.

25:45.430 --> 25:47.262
Tell me what you need.

25:47.264 --> 25:50.766
I'm working an undercover case, I need
to put some pressure on a suspect.

25:50.768 --> 25:55.204
Shake him down. I need an arrest,
nothing major, doesn't even have to stick.

25:55.206 --> 25:57.406
Guy's name is Jack Cahill.

26:19.663 --> 26:21.029
You in the bathroom?

26:23.265 --> 26:24.766
What the hell are you doing?

26:24.768 --> 26:28.302
Told you before, I need to know
where you are at all times.

26:29.405 --> 26:33.575
What you did today,
going to the cops.

26:33.577 --> 26:36.010
You're lucky Duncan didn't
tell me to put you down.

26:38.047 --> 26:43.384
You are definitely gonna be the
hottest First Lady in recent history.

26:43.386 --> 26:46.854
- What about Jackie Kennedy?
- Not even close.

26:48.957 --> 26:51.492
So, how did your meeting go
with the Vice President?

26:51.494 --> 26:54.227
Very well.

26:54.229 --> 26:58.432
He said he would be lucky as hell to
have someone like you on his circuit.

27:01.235 --> 27:02.670
- Love you.
- Mmm-hmm?

27:02.672 --> 27:04.204
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

27:12.180 --> 27:14.081
One more thing,

27:14.083 --> 27:17.717
drop by the Attorney General's
office and kiss his ring.

27:17.719 --> 27:20.454
He and Vice President Grant
are good friends.

27:20.456 --> 27:23.390
I will make up a reason to pay
him a visit this afternoon.

27:23.392 --> 27:24.424
Good.

27:27.127 --> 27:29.195
Just keep it quiet.

27:29.197 --> 27:31.931
You don't want anyone to know
that you're lobbying for this.

27:44.911 --> 27:47.346
Are you Dr. Sanders?

27:47.348 --> 27:48.447
Yes.

27:49.816 --> 27:52.518
That was my father,
the man you saved.

27:54.654 --> 27:57.990
Oh, well, he's gonna pull through.

27:57.992 --> 28:01.126
I know my father has a lot
of problems, um,

28:01.128 --> 28:04.510
I don't know if he killed that police man
or what, but either way,

28:04.599 --> 28:09.367
he's still a person,
and he's still my father, so,

28:09.369 --> 28:11.436
thank you for taking care of him.

28:41.299 --> 28:42.933
Scotch, please.

28:51.309 --> 28:53.143
You look familiar.

28:53.145 --> 28:54.645
You work for the Bureau?

28:55.680 --> 28:58.348
I used to, 20 years ago.

28:58.350 --> 28:59.483
Where are you now?

29:00.518 --> 29:01.552
Secret Service.

29:03.354 --> 29:05.354
Duncan Carlisle, FBI.

29:06.724 --> 29:08.725
- Jack Cahill, nice to meet you.
- You too.

29:08.727 --> 29:10.093
What division are you with?

29:10.095 --> 29:12.095
Crisis negotiation.

29:12.097 --> 29:14.064
Good for you.

29:14.066 --> 29:15.364
Has its moments.

29:23.240 --> 29:25.341
You seen Sandrine?

29:25.343 --> 29:28.844
She came back with me a few hours ago.
She's around here somewhere. Why?

29:30.780 --> 29:32.615
Just wondering.

29:32.617 --> 29:35.718
Why don't you just focus
on babysitting this one?

29:42.625 --> 29:44.892
Don't got anywhere, Brian.
I'll be right back.

30:33.140 --> 30:34.741
Leave a message.

30:34.743 --> 30:38.010
Hey, Sandrine, it's me.

30:38.012 --> 30:40.613
Just checkin' in.
Call me when you can.

30:54.394 --> 30:56.228
Come on, come on.

31:04.137 --> 31:05.204
Hello?

31:05.206 --> 31:07.806
Hi, is this Nina?

31:07.808 --> 31:10.008
Yes, who is this?

31:10.010 --> 31:12.877
My name is Brian Sanders.

31:12.879 --> 31:14.446
Um, do I know you?

31:14.448 --> 31:15.914
<i>No.</i>

31:18.184 --> 31:20.051
I'm confused, why are you calling?

31:20.053 --> 31:21.820
<i>What's this about?</i>

31:21.822 --> 31:23.487
I know your husband, Duncan.

31:23.489 --> 31:25.471
I'm calling, because...

31:25.479 --> 31:28.495
he's holding my family hostage.

31:37.700 --> 31:39.835
Look, I know this sounds impossible,

31:39.870 --> 31:43.186
but, on the lives of my two kids,
it is true, every word.

31:44.390 --> 31:45.489
I don't believe you.

31:45.491 --> 31:47.625
Is this some sort of sick joke?

31:47.627 --> 31:49.807
Look, my wife came
to visit you the other day.

31:49.829 --> 31:51.885
You thought she was
an alternative doctor?

31:51.920 --> 31:54.131
- That was your wife?
- Yeah. Her name is Ellen Sanders.

31:54.133 --> 31:56.466
She's operating on the President
in three days.

31:56.468 --> 31:57.935
Look it up online if you have to.

32:02.473 --> 32:06.476
So, you're telling me that
the President is...

32:06.478 --> 32:09.712
Your biological father, yeah.

32:09.714 --> 32:12.181
And my husband,

32:12.183 --> 32:16.886
- is holding your family hostage?
- Yes! For the past two weeks.

32:16.888 --> 32:21.090
Your husband has lost his mind.
Innocent people are dying.

32:21.092 --> 32:22.792
You have to stop him! Now!

32:24.094 --> 32:26.495
What's making me crazy is
the idea of losing you.

32:26.497 --> 32:28.630
Some things are just
beyond our control.

32:28.632 --> 32:29.999
There are other ways.

32:30.001 --> 32:31.200
Other choices we can make.

32:31.202 --> 32:33.402
- Is it legal?
- It's a chance.

32:34.504 --> 32:36.738
Our only chance.

32:36.740 --> 32:39.741
I know you're sick,
but I don't care!

32:39.743 --> 32:43.712
If my family dies, it's on you!
Not your father, not your husband,

32:43.714 --> 32:44.813
you!

32:53.490 --> 32:57.359
The hardest part about having a
simple life, is being a spectator.

32:57.361 --> 33:00.661
You wanna help, do something, but...

33:00.663 --> 33:04.099
I can relate.
My wife's in the hospital too.

33:06.168 --> 33:09.537
She was in a car accident
a few years ago.

33:09.539 --> 33:12.707
- She suffered some brain trauma.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

33:12.709 --> 33:15.309
You're right, though,
about how tough it is.

33:15.311 --> 33:18.679
Whether you like it or not,
you, uh, you're helpless.

33:19.882 --> 33:23.350
You just have to sit around
and hope.

33:25.988 --> 33:27.989
Easier said than done.

33:29.892 --> 33:31.125
To getting through it.

33:40.268 --> 33:43.203
Sorry, could you get that
bartender's attention for me?

33:43.205 --> 33:45.039
- No problem. Phil?
- Yeah.

33:47.141 --> 33:48.875
It's the same.

33:50.377 --> 33:51.811
Okay if I squeeze in here?

33:51.813 --> 33:53.146
Be my guest.

33:55.783 --> 33:58.351
I'm Nicole.

33:58.353 --> 34:00.486
- Jack.
- Jack.

34:00.488 --> 34:04.323
I always liked that name.
Never met a Jack who wasn't a decent guy.

34:08.661 --> 34:10.396
Hello, Vanessa.

34:11.630 --> 34:13.899
Lyn. Hello!

34:16.402 --> 34:17.770
Always a pleasure.

34:17.772 --> 34:18.971
How are you holdin' up?

34:18.973 --> 34:20.039
I'm okay.

34:21.340 --> 34:24.509
- But...
- What, what is it?

34:24.511 --> 34:26.779
Come here.

34:26.781 --> 34:29.281
I'm a little concerned
about Colonel Blair.

34:29.283 --> 34:33.786
It's probably nothing, but I heard he was
meeting today with the Attorney General.

34:33.788 --> 34:35.454
Well, I'm sure he had a reason.

34:35.456 --> 34:39.190
You would think so, but
when I spoke to him, he...

34:40.326 --> 34:41.793
He lied.

34:41.795 --> 34:44.362
He said he never left the office.

34:44.364 --> 34:47.998
You don't think the Colonel's getting
nervous and looking to cut a deal?

34:49.469 --> 34:52.504
Well, either it's a coincidence
or it's a problem,

34:52.505 --> 34:56.975
and as I don't believe in the former,
I'm gonna presume that it's the latter.

34:56.976 --> 35:00.979
So, let me make a few calls.

35:00.981 --> 35:02.313
See what's going on.

35:03.916 --> 35:05.583
We split up about a year ago.

35:05.585 --> 35:07.819
He was a nice guy,
he was just selfish.

35:07.821 --> 35:11.455
All he talked about was his job
and his problems, I just...

35:11.457 --> 35:13.324
I felt like I was all alone.

35:13.326 --> 35:15.226
Well, you have to talk,

35:15.228 --> 35:18.496
laugh, connect. I mean, that's the whole
point of being with someone, right?

35:18.498 --> 35:19.497
Exactly!

35:21.600 --> 35:24.285
I'm gonna get out of here.
Good to meet you.

35:24.286 --> 35:26.150
You too.

35:31.909 --> 35:34.645
Well, are you sure this
guy's hooking up tonight?

35:34.647 --> 35:36.412
He should be heading out
any minute.

35:38.983 --> 35:40.951
Who is he?

35:40.953 --> 35:42.985
Off-duty Secret Service agent.

35:44.221 --> 35:45.488
It's complicated.

35:45.490 --> 35:47.089
Okay, fine.

35:47.091 --> 35:48.458
Forget I asked.

35:51.128 --> 35:52.629
So,

35:54.131 --> 35:56.132
how's Nina doing? Any better?

35:59.069 --> 36:01.937
- I think she's gonna pull through.
- Really?

36:04.641 --> 36:06.441
I'm thrilled. I, you know...

36:08.178 --> 36:12.181
You know, to tell you the truth,
uh, I was afraid to ask.

36:14.584 --> 36:16.552
I'm happy for you.

36:16.554 --> 36:17.786
Thanks.

36:22.091 --> 36:23.225
There he is.

36:26.162 --> 36:27.829
Thanks for giving me a ride.

36:27.831 --> 36:30.965
No problem, it's on my way.
I live over on Capitol Hill.

36:35.037 --> 36:36.270
Thank you.

36:51.920 --> 36:57.656
Um, I'm sorry, but I'm married.
I should've said something earlier.

36:58.526 --> 37:02.362
Well, I won't tell if you don't.

37:02.364 --> 37:05.232
I'm flattered but, uh,

37:05.234 --> 37:07.500
I can't. It's a long story.

37:11.171 --> 37:15.808
- You're not attracted to me?
- No! You're beautiful, trust me. Just...

37:17.277 --> 37:18.577
I love my wife.

37:20.881 --> 37:23.682
Well, that's really sweet.

37:23.684 --> 37:27.085
I could still give you a ride home,
there's no rule against that.

37:28.921 --> 37:32.157
- Please step out of the vehicle.
- What for?

37:32.159 --> 37:35.794
Sir, please step out of the vehicle.
DC Police.

37:35.796 --> 37:38.364
- We were just talking, Officer.
- Just keep your mouth shut.

37:38.366 --> 37:40.832
You're facing solicitation
charges, so just sit tight...

37:40.834 --> 37:43.601
Whoa, whoa. Solicitation?
Look, you got things mixed up, fella.

37:43.603 --> 37:46.504
- He was just gonna give me a ride...
- I'm not gonna ask you again.

37:46.506 --> 37:47.739
Get out of the vehicle now!

37:47.741 --> 37:50.308
Just relax, I'll handle this.

37:50.310 --> 37:53.011
Listen, you don't have
to raise your voice, okay?

37:53.013 --> 37:54.646
Look, just let me explain,
all right?

37:54.648 --> 37:57.249
- You don't have to explain anything.
- You're under arrest.

37:57.251 --> 38:01.653
- Look, tough guy. I'm just gonna show...
- Whoa. Don't touch anything.

38:01.655 --> 38:04.021
- I'm just gonna show you...
- Keep your hand away from the gun.

38:25.510 --> 38:26.844
Hi.

38:26.846 --> 38:30.247
Amelia just called. You don't
have her phone, do you?

38:32.950 --> 38:35.686
Yeah. I stole it.

38:38.989 --> 38:40.424
Why?

38:40.426 --> 38:43.893
Because, Dad said he needed a
phone that couldn't be traced.

38:43.895 --> 38:46.170
I think he has a plan to get
us out of this.

38:46.209 --> 38:48.288
A plan?

38:48.323 --> 38:51.367
- I thought Mom told us to cooperate?
- She did, but

38:51.369 --> 38:55.171
I don't know what's going
on with them. I think...

38:57.441 --> 38:58.708
Hey.

38:58.710 --> 39:00.210
How was work?

39:00.212 --> 39:04.613
I had a patient with a
very complicated surgery.

39:04.615 --> 39:06.515
Did he die?

39:06.517 --> 39:08.617
No.

39:08.619 --> 39:12.020
So, what about us?
Do you and Dad have a plan, or?

39:14.424 --> 39:16.359
We're gonna make sure you're safe.

39:18.528 --> 39:20.996
Does that mean you've decided
to kill the President?

39:30.306 --> 39:32.574
I heard what happened.

39:32.576 --> 39:36.211
Little more drama than I was
expecting, but a win is a win.

39:36.213 --> 39:39.046
An honest cop got shot.
That's not a win.

39:40.583 --> 39:42.149
I apologize,

39:42.151 --> 39:46.087
but we accomplished what we set
out to do, discredit Cahill.

39:46.089 --> 39:49.090
There's no way he stays on the
President's detail after this.

39:49.092 --> 39:51.593
Dead cop, a career hooker
in his front seat.

39:51.595 --> 39:54.796
So, despite the loss
of your colleague...

39:54.798 --> 39:56.797
Friend. My friend.

39:58.433 --> 40:03.204
Despite the loss of your friend,
this was an operational victory.

40:03.206 --> 40:06.640
We're back on track.
Logan will be in charge of the detail.

40:09.544 --> 40:12.379
We're in this together.
You and me.

40:17.184 --> 40:18.184
One more thing,

40:19.654 --> 40:22.022
why do you have two of your people
following a federal prosecutor

40:22.024 --> 40:23.223
named Steve Patterson?

40:24.559 --> 40:26.660
How did you know that?

40:26.662 --> 40:29.362
You forget? I'm with the NSA.

40:31.732 --> 40:34.467
Steve Patterson is part of
an ongoing FBI investigation,

40:34.469 --> 40:37.170
we think he might be playing
ball with a drug cartel.

40:37.172 --> 40:39.439
Like you, I'm working
two jobs right now.

40:39.441 --> 40:43.209
So, I had to outsource my surveillance
work to a few of my team members.

40:44.312 --> 40:46.211
Good.

40:46.213 --> 40:47.980
I thought you were getting
cold feet.

40:49.716 --> 40:51.116
My feet are just fine.

41:01.027 --> 41:02.661
Archer?

41:02.663 --> 41:07.066
Sandrine took the bait.
She's working for the other side.

41:12.305 --> 41:14.006
A hero is strong.

41:14.008 --> 41:17.542
A hero does things nobody else
is brave enough to do.

41:17.544 --> 41:22.113
A hero is a good person, who wants to make
sure that people are safe and don't die.

41:22.115 --> 41:24.583
That's why my dad is a hero.

41:28.287 --> 41:29.554
Thank you, honey.

41:33.526 --> 41:34.692
Thank you.

41:36.795 --> 41:38.596
Just checked my voicemail,

41:38.598 --> 41:40.898
Nina called, several times.

41:40.900 --> 41:42.733
She's been trying to reach you.

41:47.106 --> 41:49.273
I told her everything.

41:49.275 --> 41:50.875
She's the only one

41:51.943 --> 41:54.444
that can stop this madness.

41:58.884 --> 42:00.417
No, she's not.

42:03.989 --> 42:05.288
I can.

42:09.727 --> 42:11.161
I was wrong.

42:11.163 --> 42:13.863
I mean, I'm a doctor.
What was I thinking?

42:17.001 --> 42:18.635
I need to tell him I won't do it.

42:23.307 --> 42:24.908
I am so sorry, Brian.

42:26.343 --> 42:27.911
You were right.

42:30.014 --> 42:31.280
I just,

42:34.184 --> 42:35.718
lost myself.

42:39.823 --> 42:41.123
I love you.

42:51.568 --> 42:53.835
What's wrong? Are you okay?

42:55.738 --> 42:57.405
I talked to Brian Sanders.

42:59.275 --> 43:03.311
He told me what's going on,
what you've done to his family,

43:03.313 --> 43:04.580
what you're planning.

43:06.749 --> 43:08.956
Is it true?
