- Your face.

03:10.934 --> 03:12.800
- This ain't shit.

03:12.867 --> 03:14.834
You should've seen me
a few days ago.

03:14.900 --> 03:16.000
You'd have been proud.

03:16.066 --> 03:18.967
- I ain't proud, Omar,
I'm sorry.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.567
- Me too.

03:20.633 --> 03:24.000
I fucked up, and I know that.

03:24.066 --> 03:25.500
Look, if I tell you
why I was selling tits,

03:25.567 --> 03:27.266
I mean, you can't go
running to McManus, okay?

03:27.333 --> 03:28.967
- You have my word.

03:29.033 --> 03:31.166
- Redding forced me.

03:31.233 --> 03:33.000
I mean, I tried to tell
the motherfucker no,

03:33.066 --> 03:34.800
but he just wasn't hearin' no.

03:34.867 --> 03:36.033
- And I was too much of an ass

03:36.100 --> 03:39.133
for you to come
and ask for help, right?

03:41.700 --> 03:44.000
- I needed
those things you said,

03:44.066 --> 03:46.667
just to straighten me out.

03:46.734 --> 03:49.066
Shit, I mean, I even needed some
of that Ike Turner treatment.

03:49.133 --> 03:51.467
Look, I'm sorry, you're sorry.

03:51.533 --> 03:53.133
Next chapter, okay?

03:53.200 --> 03:56.266
- You know the ridiculous irony
of this whole thing, Omar?

03:58.600 --> 04:00.600
I was the one
with the addiction.

04:02.133 --> 04:04.200
- Huh?
- My power trip.

04:04.266 --> 04:06.700
I was high, 24/7,

04:06.767 --> 04:09.066
being the master
of your recovery.

04:09.133 --> 04:13.000
Power, it's as evil a drug
as anything else.

04:15.533 --> 04:19.300
You know,
I would like you to call me...

04:19.367 --> 04:20.567
Kareem.

04:20.633 --> 04:21.900
- Kareem it is.

04:25.734 --> 04:27.333
Thank you.

04:33.233 --> 04:34.500
- I must say,
I think you're gonna be

04:34.567 --> 04:37.000
nicely surprised
by the variety show,

04:37.066 --> 04:41.133
and Omar White
is the grand finale.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.133
- Wow, is he that good?

04:42.200 --> 04:43.233
- I didn't say that.

04:43.300 --> 04:44.767
I'm--
I'm just--

04:44.834 --> 04:46.834
I'm proudest of him
because he has really put

04:46.900 --> 04:48.834
his heart and soul into this,

04:48.900 --> 04:50.834
and as long as
he goes through with it,

04:50.900 --> 04:52.333
he will have succeeded.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.233
How well he sings
doesn't matter.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.667
- So, is there anything I can do
to help at this point?

04:57.734 --> 05:02.300
- As a matter of fact...
we need an emcee.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.300
- Forget about it.
- Oh.

05:05.367 --> 05:06.734
- I'm not that good
at ducking rotten fruit.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.200
You think I'm kidding?

05:08.266 --> 05:11.633
The mob at the Colosseum
in ancient Rome was kinder.

05:11.700 --> 05:13.300
No, why don't you try Mukada?

05:13.367 --> 05:14.834
At least
he's got God on his side.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.700
- You are such a chicken.

05:16.767 --> 05:18.367
- ♪ Laughing in the sun ♪

05:18.433 --> 05:20.800
♪ Always having fun ♪

05:20.867 --> 05:22.967
♪ Doing all those things ♪

05:23.033 --> 05:25.800
What the fuck
is that puberty shit?

05:25.867 --> 05:28.967
- Don't worry.
You're working out the kinks.

05:29.033 --> 05:30.567
Okay, here we go.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.166
- Hold up, hold up.
I just need a minute, all right?

05:35.233 --> 05:36.667
Shit.

05:36.734 --> 05:38.166
There even ain't nobody
out there and shit,

05:38.233 --> 05:39.800
and my fuckin' heart
is pounding.

05:39.867 --> 05:42.166
- Omar, you are doing fine.

05:42.233 --> 05:43.834
The butterflies are natural.

05:43.900 --> 05:46.133
- Fine means I'm fucked!

05:46.200 --> 05:47.700
Shit.

05:47.767 --> 05:49.934
I mean, these motherfuckers
are gonna eat me for lunch, man.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.300
Shit, motherfuckers!

05:52.367 --> 05:53.800
I mean,
I could just see them out there,

05:53.867 --> 05:56.200
just out there trying
to fuckin' jam me up and shit!

05:57.734 --> 06:00.767
Repeat after me.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.834
Fuck.

06:04.900 --> 06:07.767
- Huh?
- Fuck.

06:07.834 --> 06:08.934
- Fuck.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.867
- Them.

06:10.934 --> 06:12.667
Say it.

06:12.734 --> 06:13.667
- Them.

06:13.734 --> 06:15.633
- Say it!

06:15.700 --> 06:18.633
- Fuck them.

06:18.700 --> 06:20.467
- Very good.
Thank you very much.

06:20.533 --> 06:22.300
Okay, here we go.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.467
- Poet,
can I talk to you a second?

06:27.533 --> 06:28.967
I need a little bit
of advice, man.

06:29.033 --> 06:30.967
Now, I be seeing you
getting up there, you know,

06:31.033 --> 06:33.300
in front of everybody,
reciting your poetry.

06:33.367 --> 06:34.800
- Yeah.

06:34.867 --> 06:35.967
- Well, I got
this talent show gig--

06:36.033 --> 06:37.266
- Oh, man.
- And I'm buggin'.

06:37.333 --> 06:39.633
- Here, sit down.
Poet got the answer.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.500
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.266
I got the answer.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.800
- How you be getting up
on stage like that, you know?

06:47.867 --> 06:49.000
Calm and cocky and shit,

06:49.066 --> 06:51.200
like you own the joint and shit?

06:51.266 --> 06:54.567
- Easy. Big old titty-fuck
in the green room

06:54.633 --> 06:57.000
always do the trick.

06:57.066 --> 06:59.166
- I can't go there, man.

06:59.233 --> 07:01.834
- Why not?
Why not?

07:01.900 --> 07:05.000
'Cause McManus and Said
say you can't?

07:05.066 --> 07:06.834
Let me tell you something, cuz.

07:06.900 --> 07:09.333
I already been down that road
with them two.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.934
Said feedin' me that bullshit
that I'm gonna be a symbol.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.133
A phoenix rising
on the wings of poetry

07:16.200 --> 07:19.800
from the ashes of a crack hou--
man, fuck that!

07:19.867 --> 07:22.133
I'm just surviving the war, yo.

07:22.200 --> 07:25.133
And me getting up on stage,
kicking them rhymes,

07:25.200 --> 07:27.133
that's me firing back.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.967
I mean,
juicing up when I need to,

07:29.033 --> 07:30.834
that's me treating the wounds.

07:37.667 --> 07:40.800
Well, just in case
you need the medicine,

07:40.867 --> 07:42.600
we'll call that an IOU.

07:44.033 --> 07:46.133
- Just in case, all right?

07:46.200 --> 07:48.333
- And remember one thing.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.333
Everyone's eyes'll be on you.

08:15.166 --> 08:16.467
- Okay, thanks,
you're beautiful.

08:16.533 --> 08:18.567
- You suck!

08:22.200 --> 08:24.233
- Jesus, that's a tough crowd.

08:25.533 --> 08:28.467
- I would tell you to imagine
that they're all naked,

08:28.533 --> 08:32.767
but I guess you've already
seen a lot of them naked.

08:33.867 --> 08:36.266

- You are.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.533
You're waiting for me
to take back what I said,

10:44.600 --> 10:47.867
that you always bet
on the impossible and lose.

10:47.934 --> 10:49.867
- Well, let me get you started.

10:49.934 --> 10:51.367
"I was wrong."

10:51.433 --> 10:53.033
- Timmy, you are so cute.

10:53.100 --> 10:55.367
Very few men
would find vindication

10:55.433 --> 10:56.700
in the prison version
of "Star Search".

10:56.767 --> 10:58.200
- Okay, okay, I'm gloating.

10:58.266 --> 10:59.934
But, you know, indulge me.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.967
Omar White was a lost cause,
but I didn't give up on him.

11:04.033 --> 11:06.600
I stayed by his side,
and you know what?

11:06.667 --> 11:08.400
It's worth all the shit
that hasn't worked,

11:08.467 --> 11:11.734
to see one of them,
just one, pull through.

11:14.734 --> 11:17.200
- Still ironing your own shirts,
aren't you?

11:17.266 --> 11:19.834
- You know,
I know what you're thinking.

11:19.900 --> 11:21.300
Tim loves his lost causes.

11:21.367 --> 11:23.500
- I love when you read my mind.

11:23.567 --> 11:26.266
Try again.

11:30.567 --> 11:32.333
- Oh, what's up, dude?

11:32.400 --> 11:35.333
Do Poet got the cure,
or do Poet got the cure?

11:35.400 --> 11:37.834
- Homey took a rain check.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.266
I ain't need that shit, cuz.

11:39.333 --> 11:41.867
I mean, I was close, man,
but then I said,

11:41.934 --> 11:44.233
"Don't numb yourself.
Feel it."

11:44.300 --> 11:46.433
- Are you fucking with me?
You're fucking with me, right?

11:46.500 --> 11:48.867
- No, it's the tits
that's fucking with you.

11:50.266 --> 11:52.300
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

11:53.433 --> 11:54.967
Oh!

11:59.100 --> 12:01.867
- "Once again,
with all due respect, Imam,

12:01.934 --> 12:04.533
"we are concerned
with who you choose

12:04.600 --> 12:07.133
to spend your time with."

12:08.767 --> 12:10.633
Am I close?

12:12.100 --> 12:13.233
I thought so.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.433
- With all
Omar White's put you through

12:14.500 --> 12:17.700
in this so-called sponsorship,

12:17.767 --> 12:19.166
now you two are buddy-buddy?

12:19.233 --> 12:23.333
- Yes, 'cause the alternative
is repugnant to me.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.500
- Meaning?

12:24.567 --> 12:26.000
- There's been a largely unknown

12:26.066 --> 12:28.633
but disgusting stain
upon our faith,

12:28.700 --> 12:31.667
and it's an issue that I--
I've ignored

12:31.734 --> 12:34.000
in my teachings to you.

12:34.066 --> 12:38.000
Despite the Koran's
forbiddance of slavery,

12:38.066 --> 12:42.166
there's an evil tradition
which continues to this day.

12:42.233 --> 12:46.333
Our Islamic brothers
of the north,

12:46.400 --> 12:47.834
they capture
our African brothers

12:47.900 --> 12:51.200
of the south,
all in the name of Allah,

12:51.266 --> 12:54.166
to Islamicize people
who look like you and me.

12:54.233 --> 12:58.133
But we Muslims in America,
we turn a blind eye to that

12:58.200 --> 13:00.200
because it doesn't fit
the neat little package

13:00.266 --> 13:03.700
of white Christians
enslaving blacks.

13:08.266 --> 13:11.633
I finally learned
that in a sense,

13:11.700 --> 13:15.467
I was capturing people
to our faith

13:15.533 --> 13:17.400
to serve my own needs.

13:17.467 --> 13:19.800
- You consider
your attempts at conversion

13:19.867 --> 13:21.266
a form of enslavement?

13:21.333 --> 13:22.667
- Yes,

13:22.734 --> 13:23.834
to the degree
that it has helped me

13:23.900 --> 13:25.633
maintain my self-image,

13:25.700 --> 13:29.834
and sometimes that degree
has been a significant degree.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.934
Then there's Adebisi.

13:34.066 --> 13:37.166
He's a black African man
who mocked and defied everything

13:37.233 --> 13:39.734
I wanted a black man to be.

13:39.800 --> 13:43.000
The spirit of Adebisi
did not bleed into me.

13:43.066 --> 13:44.834
That's voodoo.

13:44.900 --> 13:46.500
It didn't make me
a violent man.

13:46.567 --> 13:50.834
I am a violent man,
like anyone else.

13:50.900 --> 13:55.133
Failing to win him over,
I got rid of him.

13:56.767 --> 13:58.867
If we,
as blacks and as Muslims,

13:58.934 --> 14:01.967
are truly gonna fight
for freedom...

14:04.600 --> 14:07.467
Omar White should be allowed
to be who he is...

14:08.934 --> 14:11.567
And I should be allowed
to be who I am.

14:13.033 --> 14:15.300
So I thank Allah

14:15.367 --> 14:18.967
for the so-called sponsorship

14:19.033 --> 14:21.300
that he has put me through.

14:42.633 --> 14:45.300
- Prisoner #97R492.

14:45.367 --> 14:47.500
James Robson.

14:47.567 --> 14:50.266
Convicted November 7th, 1997.

14:50.333 --> 14:51.767
Murder in the first degree.

14:51.834 --> 14:53.333
Assault.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.166
Sentence: life.

14:55.233 --> 14:58.734
Up for parole in 25 years.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.533
- Not much of a meal there.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.100
- Yeah, nothing cold or crunchy.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.567
- Why, are you on a diet?

15:07.633 --> 15:11.433
- 'Cause it hurts, dipshit.
Do I look fat to you?

15:14.867 --> 15:17.133
God damn it.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.300
Suddenly, ice cream, croutons--

15:19.367 --> 15:20.967
it's like
getting your gums raked.

15:21.033 --> 15:22.467
What the fuck is that?

15:22.533 --> 15:25.000
- They're probably recessive.

15:25.066 --> 15:27.333
My old man had bad gums.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.133
- When's the last time
you got a cleaning?

15:30.200 --> 15:31.800
- I don't know,
five or six years.

15:31.867 --> 15:33.934
I hate the fucking dentist.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.166
- Don't fuck around
with your mouth.

15:35.233 --> 15:36.500
My old man didn't deal,

15:36.567 --> 15:39.000
his mouth ended up
a train wreck.

15:39.066 --> 15:41.200
- If I was you,
I'd see Dr. Faraj.

15:41.266 --> 15:42.734
You don't want to be slurpin'
turkey milk shakes

15:42.800 --> 15:43.734
in middle age.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.500
- Faraj?

15:45.567 --> 15:48.266
I don't want some sand nigger's
paws probin' my mouth.

15:48.333 --> 15:50.000
- They wear gloves now,
you know,

15:50.066 --> 15:51.767
since AIDS came along.

15:53.066 --> 15:55.166
- Oh.

15:55.233 --> 15:57.400
- Jesus, how long
has it really been?

15:57.467 --> 15:59.000
- Well,
aside from some cavities,

15:59.066 --> 16:00.834
you can see
that 10 and 11 show

16:00.900 --> 16:02.300
significant recession
in the gums--

16:02.367 --> 16:03.500
- Meaning what?

16:03.567 --> 16:04.834
- Meaning
that surgery is recommended,

16:04.900 --> 16:06.667
and I would say sooner
rather than later.

16:06.734 --> 16:08.133
- What kind of fuckin' surgery?

16:09.433 --> 16:10.367
- Well, you have two choices.

16:10.433 --> 16:11.467
The conventional method

16:11.533 --> 16:12.467
is to take palatal tissue

16:12.533 --> 16:13.467
from the roof of your mouth

16:13.533 --> 16:14.633
and graft it to your gums.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.867
- Oh, shit.
That sounds fuckin' painful.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.633
- It is painful.

16:18.700 --> 16:21.800
The alternative is
an acellular dermal graft,

16:21.867 --> 16:24.500
where we use the gum tissue
from a cadaver.

16:24.567 --> 16:25.800
- You're kidding.

16:25.867 --> 16:28.367
Some dead person's
fucking gums in my mouth?

16:28.433 --> 16:32.133
- Well, you can think of it
as an organ donation.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.333
- Sounds fucking creepy.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.300
- Well, the use
of your own fucking tissue

16:35.367 --> 16:37.300
would require a longer
and more painful period

16:37.367 --> 16:39.633
of fucking recovery.

16:39.700 --> 16:40.967
In the end,
your fucking gums would be

16:41.033 --> 16:43.433
healthy either fucking way.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.066
- Are you mocking me, Faraj?

16:45.133 --> 16:46.834
- Fuck, no.

16:46.900 --> 16:49.900
- I don't like your third world
bullshit attitude.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.667
And whatever I decide, Gunga,

16:54.734 --> 16:56.333
I got a thing about needles.

16:56.400 --> 17:00.100
Any anesthesia or whatever,
I want gas first.

17:01.567 --> 17:03.000
- My pleasure, sahib.

17:03.066 --> 17:05.000
- Oh, and one more thing.

17:05.066 --> 17:07.333
Being that I'm Aryan
and you're camel shit,

17:07.400 --> 17:08.400
I'd appreciate it
if you wore two pairs

17:08.467 --> 17:09.633
of those plastic gloves.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.600
You know,
the less contact, the better.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.166
So, what do you think?

17:18.233 --> 17:21.233
- Well, it ain't a pretty set
of options, that's for sure.

17:21.300 --> 17:22.467
- No shit.

17:22.533 --> 17:23.734
Now you see why
I hate the dentist?

17:23.800 --> 17:25.633
- It's not their fault, Robson.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.300
You wait years
between cleanings,

17:27.367 --> 17:29.133
you never floss,
and you brush your teeth

17:29.200 --> 17:31.233
the way
you scratch your scrotum.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.734
- I'm considering
the acellular thing.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.967
- All right, which one's that?

17:37.033 --> 17:38.800
- It's like organ donation.

17:38.867 --> 17:41.233
If I needed a liver,
the donor would be dead, right?

17:41.300 --> 17:42.967
- True,
but you don't need a liver.

17:43.033 --> 17:44.400
We don't see the liver.

17:44.467 --> 17:45.867
- Well, he said it's like
a small piece of tissue.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.500
- Yeah.
- It's, like, right here.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.600
- All right, can we just talk
about something else, please?

17:49.667 --> 17:51.333
- Fuck it.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.800
I'm going graveyard gums.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.033
Holy shit.

18:00.100 --> 18:02.667
Oh, hey, what's up, doc?

18:02.734 --> 18:05.333
Oh.
Hey, how's this stuff legal?

18:05.400 --> 18:07.000
You know what kind
of killing you'd make

18:07.066 --> 18:09.333
selling it
to all the drug fiends in Oz?

18:09.400 --> 18:11.567
They may have tits,
but you've got pussy.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.633
- What is it
with you Nazis and gas?

18:16.500 --> 18:18.600
Oh, fuck you!

18:18.667 --> 18:20.767
Hey, I thought I said
to wear two pairs of gloves.

18:20.834 --> 18:21.900
- Open wide.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.367
- No, let me have some more gas.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.300
- You don't need more gas, okay?
- I feel it wearing off.

18:25.367 --> 18:26.633
- Okay, open wide.

18:26.700 --> 18:27.934
You know,
with all your warped ideology,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.133
I bet
you never gave much thought

18:30.200 --> 18:32.767
to why Adolf was so pissed off
at the Jews.

18:32.834 --> 18:35.300
You know, one theory
is that he was traumatized

18:35.367 --> 18:37.467
by the death of his mother.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.467
She died of breast cancer,
and she was in the care

18:39.533 --> 18:42.300
of a Jewish physician, and so,

18:42.367 --> 18:43.667
of course,
the repressed hatred

18:43.734 --> 18:46.500
erupted itself
into the Holocaust.

18:46.567 --> 18:50.133
Now, another theory

18:50.200 --> 18:52.800
is that Hitler's father

18:52.867 --> 18:57.166
was the illegitimate son
of a German woman

18:57.233 --> 18:59.433
and some obscure Jewish man,

18:59.500 --> 19:03.200
and so
Hitler himself had impure blood.

19:03.266 --> 19:06.166
Oh, hey, hey, now,
don't make me slip,

19:06.233 --> 19:09.567
because if I do,
we are both in trouble, hmm?

19:09.633 --> 19:11.100
You know, it's amazing.

19:11.166 --> 19:14.033
We don't even know
where these gums come from.

19:15.333 --> 19:19.667
I mean,
this could be the gums of a kike

19:19.734 --> 19:22.934
or a spic

19:23.000 --> 19:24.033
or even a faggot.

19:24.100 --> 19:25.600
Fucking faggot.

19:25.667 --> 19:28.200
- I mean, you could be getting

19:28.266 --> 19:33.266
the beautiful gums
of a big black nigger, huh?

- Check this out.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.867
Fetch.

20:13.300 --> 20:15.233
Come here.
Come here.

20:15.300 --> 20:17.367
He fetches.

20:17.433 --> 20:18.867
- That's one thing
he'll have to unlearn.

20:18.934 --> 20:21.500
I told you, don't teach the dog
recreational activities.

20:21.567 --> 20:23.066
- You brush your teeth
with that?

20:23.133 --> 20:25.166
- Today's focus is on control.

20:25.233 --> 20:27.967
Start walking around
in this area.

20:35.633 --> 20:38.066
- What the fuck was that?
- Scared the shit out of me.

20:38.133 --> 20:40.867
- I'm sorry, but your reaction's
not important.

20:40.934 --> 20:42.200
The dogs' is.

20:42.266 --> 20:43.867
They have to maintain focus,

20:43.934 --> 20:46.633
even in the event
of loud or startling noises.

20:46.700 --> 20:48.700
- So what are you gonna do,
make them deaf?

20:48.767 --> 20:49.967
- Oh, yeah, that's a great idea.

20:50.033 --> 20:51.033
Deaf dog.
Blind people.

20:51.100 --> 20:52.033
You're a fucking genius.

20:52.100 --> 20:53.567
- You teach the dog

20:53.633 --> 20:57.066
by standing on his leash
and saying, "Chill."

20:57.133 --> 20:59.333
- "Chill"?
- "Chill."

21:10.967 --> 21:14.000
- Remember when I first started,
I told you about Officer Rivera,

21:14.066 --> 21:17.000
you know, what I'd done to him,
you know, blinded him,

21:17.066 --> 21:18.867
and how I just wanted
to do right?

21:18.934 --> 21:20.100
- Yeah, you're doing that.

21:20.166 --> 21:22.000
- Yeah,
but I just want to do right

21:22.066 --> 21:23.533
by him direct.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.900
I want Rivera to have Julie.

21:25.967 --> 21:28.500
- Well, what's the man's status?

21:28.567 --> 21:30.000
- I don't know.

21:30.066 --> 21:31.934
I haven't heard from Eugene
in a long time.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.166
- Call him.

21:33.233 --> 21:34.834
Have him come in,
we can talk,

21:34.900 --> 21:37.400
assess his want and need
of a guide dog.

21:37.467 --> 21:38.600
- Well, I'll try,

21:38.667 --> 21:39.834
but knowing how he feels
about this place,

21:39.900 --> 21:41.100
it's a long shot.

21:46.433 --> 21:49.033
Eugene, Tina,
it's good to see you.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.033
You're both looking well.

21:51.100 --> 21:53.367
- I'll take your word for that.

21:53.433 --> 21:56.266
- I'm Alicia Hinden.
I appreciate you coming in.

21:56.333 --> 21:58.467
- Hello.

21:58.533 --> 22:00.633
- So did you read the literature
I sent you on the program?

22:00.700 --> 22:03.533
- Yes,
sounds kind of interesting.

22:03.600 --> 22:06.000
- Yeah, if you've got
no other help.

22:06.066 --> 22:08.700
Those dogs
are for lonely people.

22:08.767 --> 22:10.033
Eugene has me.

22:10.100 --> 22:12.500
- Well, actually,
a guide dog is not just

22:12.567 --> 22:13.834
for the person he's leading.

22:13.900 --> 22:16.300
He helps the whole family
by freeing up your time.

22:16.367 --> 22:18.500
- I like helping my husband.

22:18.567 --> 22:19.800
- Tina.

22:19.867 --> 22:20.800
You would be helping
your husband.

22:20.867 --> 22:21.900
- Oh, yeah.

22:21.967 --> 22:22.900
Like those interactions

22:22.967 --> 22:24.000
with Alvarez did.

22:24.066 --> 22:25.900
- Look, I'm skeptical too.

22:25.967 --> 22:28.333
I worked here, remember?

22:28.400 --> 22:31.500
I can't believe these fucks
are capable of any good.

22:31.567 --> 22:34.700
I mean, who teaches these dogs?

22:34.767 --> 22:40.000
- Well,
the one that we've got for you,

22:40.066 --> 22:43.133
she was actually trained
by Miguel Alvarez.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.367
- Are you fucking kidding?

22:44.433 --> 22:46.433
- I knew that fucking cabrón
was behind this.

22:46.500 --> 22:47.567
- He's doing a wonderful job.

22:47.633 --> 22:48.900
- Eugene, baby,
please, let's go.

22:49.000 --> 22:49.934
- He has personally requested

22:50.000 --> 22:51.233
that we give Julie to you.

22:51.300 --> 22:54.367
so, Eugene, if you like,

22:54.433 --> 22:56.200
we can give her to you.

22:56.266 --> 22:58.200
- I don't know!
- No!

22:58.266 --> 23:00.266
No fucking way.
Eugene!

23:00.333 --> 23:01.467
What the fuck?

23:01.533 --> 23:03.100
You're actually
considering this?

23:03.166 --> 23:04.767
Probably trained that mongrel
to attack you.

23:04.834 --> 23:06.667
- No, I can assure you
that that is--

23:06.734 --> 23:08.867
- Come on.
We're leaving.

23:08.934 --> 23:11.300
The last thing we need is
favors from that motherfucker.

23:11.367 --> 23:13.367
- Mr. Rivera.

23:13.433 --> 23:14.467
Please think about it.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.900
- Good girl, Julie.

23:31.066 --> 23:34.834
- Prisoner #02N535.

23:34.900 --> 23:36.767
Father Daniel Meehan.

23:39.834 --> 23:42.000
Convicted February 9th, 2002.

23:42.066 --> 23:43.500
Destruction of private property.

23:43.567 --> 23:45.834
Assault
on an officer of the law.

23:45.900 --> 23:47.433
Sentence: 15 years.

23:47.500 --> 23:50.033
Up for parole in five.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.734
all: Ooh!

24:22.033 --> 24:25.066
- I'm on the bottom?
- You got that right.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.667
- There was an O'Reily family
in my last parish,

24:28.734 --> 24:29.700
St. Patrick's--

24:29.767 --> 24:31.166
- Well, it wasn't mine.

24:31.233 --> 24:33.967
We only went to church
for funerals.

24:35.233 --> 24:37.333
- Oh, I see.

24:37.400 --> 24:38.767
- No.

24:40.066 --> 24:42.500
You don't see dick.

24:42.567 --> 24:44.000
Just 'cause
I was baptized a Catholic

24:44.066 --> 24:47.500
doesn't mean I got any use
for a fuckin' priest.

24:47.567 --> 24:49.066
- Duly noted.

25:02.133 --> 25:03.367
- I've cleared my schedule

25:03.433 --> 25:06.700
so I can attend Cyril's trial
every day.

25:06.767 --> 25:09.533
I'll be sitting right behind him
in the courtroom.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.467
- Mm-hmm.

25:11.533 --> 25:13.467
- Ryan, he's not gonna
get convicted.

25:13.533 --> 25:15.967
He is not gonna get
the death penalty.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.300
- Hi-ho, hi-ho.

25:19.367 --> 25:21.300
Hey.

25:21.367 --> 25:22.333
How you feeling, kid?

25:22.400 --> 25:24.467
- Scared.
- Don't be, okay?

25:24.533 --> 25:27.300
Ma's gonna be with you
the whole way, all right?

25:27.367 --> 25:29.567
- Look,
I bought you a brand-new suit.

25:29.633 --> 25:30.800
Hope it fits,

25:30.867 --> 25:32.967
'cause I wasn't sure
about the sizes.

25:33.033 --> 25:34.800
- Cyril, we're not allowed to
travel with you on the bus,

25:34.867 --> 25:36.900
okay, so I'm gonna take
Suzanne down in my car.

25:36.967 --> 25:39.500
We'll see you just before
the trial begins, okay?

25:39.567 --> 25:41.100
- Okay.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.433
- You're gonna be okay.

25:46.233 --> 25:47.934
- I wish you were coming.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.500
- No, you don't need me.
You'll be fine.

25:50.567 --> 25:53.000
But look, if you--
if you start to panic,

25:53.066 --> 25:56.867
all right, I just want you
to think of me, okay?

25:56.934 --> 25:57.967
All right?
Doing this.

25:59.900 --> 26:01.934
- Let's go, let's go.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.667
- Hey, toss the ball.

26:14.734 --> 26:16.266
Now, toss the fuckin' ball.

26:16.333 --> 26:18.900
- This is about the size
of your head, Morales.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.033
- You got style, Jia,
I'll give you that.

26:28.100 --> 26:29.967
You know, you had me fooled
thinking that you were worried

26:30.033 --> 26:32.300
about Li Chen hurting my ma.

26:32.367 --> 26:33.700
You set me and Cyril up,

26:33.767 --> 26:37.133
only you thought
your boy would waste us,

26:37.200 --> 26:39.133
not the other way around.

26:39.200 --> 26:40.934
- Zou kai.

26:42.900 --> 26:45.100
- I got moves too, brother man.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.200
Hey, Shupe.

27:06.266 --> 27:08.333
I see they let you out
of protective custody.

27:08.400 --> 27:09.834
- Don't start anything, O'Reily.

27:09.900 --> 27:11.500
- I ain't starting shit.

27:11.567 --> 27:12.700
I'm just wondering

27:12.767 --> 27:14.433
how much money
Jai Kenmin paid you

27:14.500 --> 27:16.100
to lie about Cyril
to the warden.

27:16.166 --> 27:18.400
Look at me.

27:18.467 --> 27:19.633
I'm gonna give you one chance

27:19.700 --> 27:21.433
to switch your story
to the truth.

27:21.500 --> 27:22.667
- I told the truth.

27:22.734 --> 27:25.600
- Okay.

27:25.667 --> 27:27.700
Hey, I made something special
for you.

27:29.033 --> 27:30.400
Eat up.

27:32.433 --> 27:33.367
- I'm not hungry.

27:33.433 --> 27:35.333
- I didn't think so.

27:44.033 --> 27:46.000
Glen Shupe.
- What about him?

27:46.066 --> 27:48.367
- I need that cocksucker
to have an accident.

27:48.433 --> 27:52.066
- How severe?
- Not dead, just diminished.

27:52.133 --> 27:54.300
And it can't be
traced back to me.

28:01.734 --> 28:03.533
- What do I get in return?

28:03.600 --> 28:04.767
- Jia Kenmin dies,

28:04.834 --> 28:06.400
and it can't be traced back
to you.

28:06.467 --> 28:08.934
- Deal.

28:14.100 --> 28:15.033
- Sean!
I need the...

28:15.100 --> 28:16.767
- Out of the way!

28:25.867 --> 28:28.133
- Doctor!
I've got the arm!

28:28.200 --> 28:29.800
I've got the arm.

28:31.500 --> 28:35.300
- The first day of trial
did not go well.

28:35.367 --> 28:36.800
Judge Moore
was in a foul mood,

28:36.867 --> 28:40.567
and the prosecutor,
he's tough and smart.

28:40.633 --> 28:42.600
- So you're saying
we're gonna lose?

28:42.667 --> 28:44.800
- I just don't want
to give any false hopes.

28:44.867 --> 28:47.800
- During the jury selection
Cyril got very agitated,

28:47.867 --> 28:49.633
and he kept talking out loud,

28:49.700 --> 28:51.333
and the judge kept warning him
to be silent.

28:51.400 --> 28:52.667
- If Cyril keeps it up,

28:52.734 --> 28:53.900
Moore might eject him
from the courtroom.

28:53.967 --> 28:56.367
- Is the judge aware
of Cyril's mental state?

28:56.433 --> 28:58.300
- Yeah, he's aware, he just--
he doesn't care.

28:58.367 --> 28:59.300
- I'll talk to Cyril.

29:09.066 --> 29:11.100
Hello, Cyril.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.100
- Hiya.

29:13.166 --> 29:14.600
- May I come in?

29:14.667 --> 29:16.700
- Sure.

29:19.166 --> 29:21.200
- How'd it go today?

29:24.166 --> 29:26.367
- Lots of mumbo jumbo.

29:27.834 --> 29:30.467
"I object."

29:30.533 --> 29:32.867
"Motion to blah, blah, blah."

29:32.934 --> 29:36.867
- Yeah, all those words
confused you, huh?

29:36.934 --> 29:39.800
- Everyone seems so mean.

29:39.867 --> 29:41.633
I was asking questions,

29:41.700 --> 29:44.000
but the guy at the big desk
banged the thing

29:44.066 --> 29:46.633
and yelled at me.

29:46.700 --> 29:50.233
Ma was behind me,
but not close enough to talk to.

29:52.033 --> 29:54.600
- I brought you something.

29:55.867 --> 29:57.967
- A puppet.

29:58.033 --> 30:02.333
- I want you to take this puppet
with you to court every day,

30:02.400 --> 30:05.500
and when you feel
the need to talk to someone,

30:05.567 --> 30:08.533
I want you to whisper
to him, okay?

30:08.600 --> 30:09.600
- Mm-hmm.

30:09.667 --> 30:10.900
- But I want you
to whisper to him

30:10.967 --> 30:14.000
very softly
so no one else can hear you.

30:14.066 --> 30:16.166
Show me.

30:16.233 --> 30:17.900
Sister Pete wants us to be...

30:17.967 --> 30:19.400
- Even softer.

30:21.900 --> 30:23.500
Sister Pete wants us to be...

30:27.400 --> 30:28.400
- Excellent.

30:28.467 --> 30:31.500
And at the end of each day,

30:31.567 --> 30:32.667
the two of you can tell me

30:32.734 --> 30:34.834
everything you whispered
to each other,

30:34.900 --> 30:37.667
and I'll explain things
to you, all right?

30:37.734 --> 30:40.367
- We have to give
the puppet a name.

30:40.433 --> 30:43.467
- Good.
What do you want to call him?

30:45.767 --> 30:48.367
- Jericho.
- Why Jericho?

30:52.100 --> 30:53.367
- 'Cause the walls

30:53.433 --> 30:55.100
came tumbling down.

30:55.166 --> 30:56.100
- Lights out!

31:21.400 --> 31:23.834
- Jesus, you pray a lot.

31:23.900 --> 31:26.667
- Well,
I need a lot from my god.

31:26.734 --> 31:29.934
Strength. Guidance.
Forgiveness.

31:30.000 --> 31:30.934
- While you're at it,
ask him

31:31.000 --> 31:32.834
to bring back conjugal visits.

31:32.900 --> 31:34.000
- Don't you ever pray?

31:34.066 --> 31:36.600
- No, not since grade school.

31:36.667 --> 31:39.200
- What happened?
Why'd you stop?

31:39.266 --> 31:41.633
- A priest tried to grope me
in the confessional.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.700
- Oh, I am sorry.

31:44.767 --> 31:46.200
Some priests get lost
spiritually--

31:46.266 --> 31:48.033
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:48.100 --> 31:51.133
Father, give it a rest,
I was just kidding.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.867
- Look, I have a meeting

31:57.934 --> 32:01.200
tomorrow with Father Mukada,
and I was thinking that--

32:01.266 --> 32:04.300
- "Lights out" means
shut the fuck up.

32:16.734 --> 32:20.500

Any word on Augustus' condition?

33:24.066 --> 33:25.767
- Well, I got a call in
to Dr. Panitz

33:25.834 --> 33:26.867
at Benchley Memorial.

33:26.934 --> 33:28.834
When he calls me,
I'll let you know.

33:28.900 --> 33:30.000
What about you?

33:30.066 --> 33:31.500
You got any news for me?
- Not yet.

33:31.567 --> 33:32.934
- You find out
who gave Hill the drugs?

33:33.000 --> 33:34.367
- Not yet.

33:34.433 --> 33:36.533
- Well, when you do,
you let me handle the rest.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.333
- Of course, McManus.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.333
Of course.

33:39.400 --> 33:40.700
- Hey, hey.

33:40.767 --> 33:42.800
You gave me your word.

33:45.233 --> 33:49.266
- And my word is my bond, hmm?

33:52.233 --> 33:54.567
- Count!
Let's go, move it!

34:03.100 --> 34:04.700
- Yo, Burr.

34:04.767 --> 34:07.633
I'm telling you,
it must've been them Sicilians

34:07.700 --> 34:09.900
that gave Augustus them drugs.

34:09.967 --> 34:11.800
They mad 'cause you and Morales

34:11.867 --> 34:14.200
is muscling them
out of the tit game.

34:14.266 --> 34:15.834
- You get me some proof.

34:15.900 --> 34:17.033
- Proof?

34:17.100 --> 34:19.367
Man,
proof is hard to come by, yo.

34:19.433 --> 34:21.567
- I need to see some proof.

34:21.633 --> 34:22.900
- Shit.

34:28.834 --> 34:29.800
Hey, yo, Chico, my man.

34:29.867 --> 34:32.000
- What do you want?

34:32.066 --> 34:34.500
- Yo, we got a problem, man.

34:34.567 --> 34:36.500
Burr thinks
that you gave Hill the juice

34:36.567 --> 34:38.000
that sent him into hyperspace,

34:38.066 --> 34:40.667
and he growling for revenge.

34:40.734 --> 34:42.000
- Me?
- Yeah.

34:42.066 --> 34:44.500
- No, man.
Yo, the Sicilians probably did.

34:44.567 --> 34:45.500
- That's what I tried
to tell him,

34:45.567 --> 34:46.500
but you know Burr, man.

34:46.567 --> 34:47.767
He want confirmation.

34:47.834 --> 34:50.567
So I got a solution.

34:50.633 --> 34:53.000
You got to find somebody
who will say

34:53.066 --> 34:56.066
that they saw the dagos
give Hill the shit.

34:56.133 --> 34:59.333
- Who?
- I don't know who, man.

34:59.400 --> 35:02.333
Somebody with no, no--
what you call it?

35:02.400 --> 35:03.900
No vested interest.

35:03.967 --> 35:05.467
- Excuse me.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.800
What?
What?

35:16.867 --> 35:18.567
Salvatore DeSanto.

35:18.633 --> 35:19.934
- Mm.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.800
- He gave the drugs to Augustus.

35:21.867 --> 35:22.800
- Mm.

35:22.867 --> 35:25.300
- Yeah, I saw the whole thing.

35:25.367 --> 35:27.734
- Okay.
- All right.

35:31.033 --> 35:32.633
- You see, I told you.

35:33.700 --> 35:34.834
- At dinner tonight,

35:34.900 --> 35:36.166
I want you to do me
a little favor

35:36.233 --> 35:39.567
and stick this
in DeSanto's food for me.

35:39.633 --> 35:41.166
- What's this?

35:41.233 --> 35:44.633
- A mind fuck.

35:46.900 --> 35:48.934
- I say we whack Redding.

35:50.233 --> 35:52.333
- We tried killing Redding.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.667
He don't fuckin' die.

35:53.734 --> 35:57.000
- That is bullshit, Sal.
Anybody can fuckin' die.

35:57.066 --> 35:58.934
- Fuck.

36:00.066 --> 36:01.633
Fuck, what's goin' on?

36:01.700 --> 36:03.467
- Jesus, what's happening?

36:03.533 --> 36:06.567
- My--
my head is...

36:14.767 --> 36:16.467
- Salvatore DeSanto's
brain-dead.

36:16.533 --> 36:17.867
Overdose of LSD.

36:17.934 --> 36:19.967
- Oh, man, that's a bummer.

36:21.200 --> 36:23.834
I saw a lot of acid myself
over in Vietnam.

36:23.900 --> 36:26.133
That stuff's more lethal
than the Vietcong.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.433
Really can blow your mind.

36:27.500 --> 36:28.700
- Yeah.

36:28.767 --> 36:30.633
You know,
I really should have the food

36:30.700 --> 36:33.300
that DeSanto was eating tested.

36:33.367 --> 36:35.467
- Now, that's a good idea.

36:35.533 --> 36:38.133
Only problem is,
ain't no food left.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.133
My boys, they ain't
so good at cooking,

36:40.200 --> 36:41.800
but when it comes
to the end of the day, man,

36:41.867 --> 36:43.300
they can clean up
that cafeteria,

36:43.367 --> 36:44.300
I'm telling you.

36:44.367 --> 36:45.367
- I'll bet.

36:45.433 --> 36:47.767
- Mm, spotless.

36:50.400 --> 36:54.500
- The first time
that I got raped by Adebisi,

36:54.567 --> 36:55.667
I thought
this was the worst thing

36:55.734 --> 36:57.467
that could ever happen.

36:57.533 --> 37:01.400
But I was wrong.

37:01.467 --> 37:04.000
- How many men were there?

37:04.066 --> 37:06.333
- Three.

37:06.400 --> 37:07.667
- Do you know why they did it?

37:07.734 --> 37:09.700
- Does the "why" matter?

37:09.767 --> 37:12.100
- Only to you.

37:12.166 --> 37:14.266
- What do you want me
to say here, Sister, I don't--

37:14.333 --> 37:17.967
- Peter, I don't want you
to say anything.

37:18.033 --> 37:20.300
I just want you to understand

37:20.367 --> 37:22.133
that no matter what you think
you may have done

37:22.200 --> 37:24.133
to bring this on yourself,

37:24.200 --> 37:27.300
you did not deserve to be raped.

37:27.367 --> 37:29.300
Those men, whoever they are,

37:29.367 --> 37:31.934
had no right to violate you.

37:33.500 --> 37:34.433
Ah, all right.

37:34.500 --> 37:36.967
Tomorrow, same time?

37:37.033 --> 37:38.400
- No.

37:39.734 --> 37:42.233
I don't think any of this
is really helping me, Sister.

37:42.300 --> 37:44.333
- Peter...

37:44.400 --> 37:46.433
- Thanks.
Thanks for trying.

37:51.734 --> 37:53.934
- I want to find the three men
who raped Schibetta.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.600
- Why?

37:55.667 --> 37:58.000
- Why, Leo?

37:58.066 --> 37:59.266
Why?

37:59.333 --> 38:00.834
- Look,
we're doing everything we can

38:00.900 --> 38:03.467
to keep the number
of reported rapes down.

38:03.533 --> 38:05.000
- Reported?

38:05.066 --> 38:06.333
Listen to you.

38:06.400 --> 38:08.166
Your own daughter was raped.

38:10.066 --> 38:12.433
- Well.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.100
This is different.

38:14.166 --> 38:16.100
This is Oz.

38:16.166 --> 38:18.567
- Rape is rape, Leo.
- I don't agree.

38:18.633 --> 38:21.767
Here,
rape has a leveling effect.

38:21.834 --> 38:23.967
Peter Schibetta,
from the day he arrived,

38:24.033 --> 38:25.800
wanted to be a tough guy,

38:25.867 --> 38:27.467
wanted to follow
in his father's footsteps,

38:27.533 --> 38:29.467
running things, hurting people.

38:29.533 --> 38:31.867
Well,
he got stopped by Adebisi.

38:31.934 --> 38:33.633
Now he got stopped again.

38:33.700 --> 38:35.133
- What's going on?

38:35.200 --> 38:38.166
Do you have something personal
against Schibetta?

38:38.233 --> 38:42.967
- No, no.
Simply survival of the fittest.

38:43.033 --> 38:45.166
As natural and basic as Darwin.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.967
- You and I have disagreed about
a lot of things over the years--

38:49.033 --> 38:50.600
- Peter Marie.

38:50.667 --> 38:53.467
- A "leveling effect"?

38:53.533 --> 38:56.600
You want rape to do your job?

39:02.233 --> 39:03.500
- You see this medal?

39:03.567 --> 39:05.667
Saint Dismas.

39:05.734 --> 39:09.166
He's the patron saint
of prisoners.

39:09.233 --> 39:12.300
Al Capone gave this
to my grandfather in the '20s.

39:12.367 --> 39:14.033
- I didn't know
Al Capone was religious.

39:14.100 --> 39:15.100
- He wasn't.

39:15.166 --> 39:17.934
He just liked to hedge his bets.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.767
Dr. Nathan.

39:19.834 --> 39:21.700
I keep feeling worse and worse.

39:23.500 --> 39:24.700
- I know.

39:26.166 --> 39:28.700
- I haven't prayed
since the fifth grade.

39:30.200 --> 39:32.133
I've forgotten how.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.900
- Me too.

39:41.700 --> 39:43.667
Hola.
- Hola yourself.

39:43.734 --> 39:45.300
- Well, you're in a mood.

39:45.367 --> 39:47.700
- Oh, I am frustrated.

39:47.767 --> 39:50.133
Been dealing
with Peter Schibetta

39:50.200 --> 39:52.300
and taking these
little baby steps,

39:52.367 --> 39:53.633
and then this morning,

39:53.700 --> 39:56.200
he tells me
he's done with therapy.

39:56.266 --> 39:57.433
- Maybe you should
have him talk

39:57.500 --> 39:58.800
to some other guy
who's been raped.

39:58.867 --> 40:00.934
- Yeah, yeah,
I was thinking about that.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.300
Listen, are you aware of any
trouble between Leo and Peter?

40:05.367 --> 40:07.967
- No, why?

40:08.033 --> 40:09.467
- Never mind.

40:09.533 --> 40:13.667
Just having one of those days
filled with massive confusion.

40:13.734 --> 40:15.800
- I'm having a day myself.

40:15.867 --> 40:18.333
Chucky Pancamo came in
with a stab wound

40:18.400 --> 40:19.734
and caught a staph infection.

40:19.800 --> 40:20.934
- Ooh.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.667
- Yeah,
he's sinking pretty fast.

40:24.066 --> 40:25.700
- And you're blaming yourself.

40:25.767 --> 40:28.166
- His wound got infected
on my watch.

40:28.233 --> 40:30.000
Life is dangerous enough in Oz

40:30.066 --> 40:32.333
without prisoners
having to worry about dying

40:32.400 --> 40:34.433
due to poor medical treatment.

40:35.800 --> 40:36.934
- Look at us.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.533
We're complete
and utter failures

40:38.600 --> 40:39.700
at our jobs.

40:39.767 --> 40:42.533
- So what do we do instead?

40:42.600 --> 40:45.100
- Form an all-girl band?

40:46.433 --> 40:48.700
Hey, I want to ask you a favor.

40:48.767 --> 40:50.533
- Sure.

40:50.600 --> 40:53.400
- I want you to talk
to Peter Schibetta.

40:54.934 --> 40:56.967
- Okay.

40:59.433 --> 41:00.867
Only if...

41:00.934 --> 41:03.000
you teach Chucky Pancamo
how to pray.

41:08.934 --> 41:11.166
- Peter.

41:11.233 --> 41:13.100
Come in.

41:16.567 --> 41:18.600
- Sit down.

41:26.233 --> 41:28.266
May I take your hand?

41:34.734 --> 41:37.633
- Blessed art thou
amongst women...

41:37.700 --> 41:39.500
- Blessed art thou
amongst women...

41:39.567 --> 41:42.667
- And blessed
is the fruit of thy womb...

41:42.734 --> 41:44.867
- Blessed
is the fruit of thy womb...

41:44.934 --> 41:47.200
- Jesus.
- Jesus.

41:47.266 --> 41:50.200
- Holy Mary, mother of God...

41:50.266 --> 41:51.867
- Holy Mary, mother of God...

41:51.934 --> 41:55.033
- Pray for us sinners...
- Pray for us sinners...

41:55.100 --> 41:58.033
- Now
and at the hour of our death.

41:58.100 --> 42:00.533
- Now
and at the hour of our death.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.133
- Amen.

- It's nice to see anyone.

43:03.767 --> 43:05.233
This fuckin' place is spooky.

43:07.266 --> 43:10.367
- Jaz, you confessed
to several murders,

43:10.433 --> 43:11.800
including Jim Burns,

43:11.867 --> 43:12.800
but you didn't act alone.

43:12.867 --> 43:14.133
You had help.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.467
- I ain't rattin' on my friends.
- No, no, no.

43:16.533 --> 43:19.233
Not all of them, but Timmy Kirk.

43:19.300 --> 43:21.300
- I killed Timmy Kirk.

43:21.367 --> 43:24.834
- No, as hard as you tried,
he survived.

43:24.900 --> 43:25.867
He's back at Oz.

43:25.934 --> 43:27.500
- Cocksucker!

43:27.567 --> 43:30.333
- You tell the warden
the truth about Kirk,

43:30.400 --> 43:32.400
and he's gonna be moving in
right next door.

43:34.066 --> 43:36.166
- Get me Glynn.

43:36.233 --> 43:37.633
I want to sing.

43:42.066 --> 43:44.166
- It's Hoyt's version
versus mine.

43:44.233 --> 43:45.500
He killed Burns.

43:45.567 --> 43:48.333
He bricked Cloutier
inside a wall.

43:48.400 --> 43:50.667
This is all some kind of weird
revenge thing on his part.

43:50.734 --> 43:51.800
I'm innocent.

43:51.867 --> 43:53.600
- You liar!

43:53.667 --> 43:54.734
- Ray! Ray.

43:54.800 --> 43:56.533
- You will burn, Kirk!

43:56.600 --> 43:57.667
- Take Kirk back to Unit B.

43:57.734 --> 43:59.700
- You're the one who'll burn.

44:09.433 --> 44:12.467
Hey, Clarence.
How are you?

44:12.533 --> 44:15.133
- Good.
- Ooh, you been working out?

44:15.200 --> 44:17.633
- Yeah.
- Yeah? I can tell.

44:17.700 --> 44:19.133
Hey, you're in for arson, right?

44:19.200 --> 44:20.500
- Yeah.

44:20.567 --> 44:22.467
- Yeah,
you know any other arsonists?

44:22.533 --> 44:24.000
I mean, on the outside.

44:24.066 --> 44:26.300
- One or two.

44:26.367 --> 44:28.166
- How'd you like a blow job?

44:31.000 --> 44:33.333
- Our Lady of Fatima Church
and its rectory next door

44:33.400 --> 44:34.934
burned to the ground
this evening,

44:35.000 --> 44:36.333
killing two priests.

44:36.400 --> 44:38.333
The two priests,
Father John Downing

44:38.400 --> 44:39.834
and Father Jack Hurlbert,

44:39.900 --> 44:42.667
were trapped on an upper floor
of the rectory.

44:42.734 --> 44:45.166
Also injured
was Father Raymond Mukada.

44:45.233 --> 44:46.333
- Holy shit!

44:46.400 --> 44:47.500
- ...And is in serious condition

44:47.567 --> 44:49.333
at Benchley Memorial Hospital.

46:30.433 --> 46:32.967
- What's the latest
on Adam Guenzel?

46:33.033 --> 46:34.467
How's your plan working?

46:34.533 --> 46:36.467
- Well,

46:36.533 --> 46:39.133
I predict...

46:39.200 --> 46:42.300
by the end of the week...

46:42.367 --> 46:44.934
he'll be sucking my cock.

46:48.233 --> 46:50.934
- Yesterday,
I deposed Jerry Heekin.

46:52.233 --> 46:53.900
- Who's that?

46:53.967 --> 46:55.266
- He's that man who claims

46:55.333 --> 46:57.400
he saw you dump Brice Tibbetts
in the field.

46:57.467 --> 47:00.133
He's a very credible witness.

47:00.200 --> 47:01.133
- Is that so?

47:01.200 --> 47:02.367
- Remember you said

47:02.433 --> 47:04.667
that he testified
it was late at night,

47:04.734 --> 47:08.166
so it must have been dark,
no lights in the field?

47:08.233 --> 47:11.433
Yeah, well, see,
he had a flashlight.

47:11.500 --> 47:13.033
He saw you.

47:13.100 --> 47:14.100
Clearly.

47:14.166 --> 47:15.934
- Wasn't me.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.800
Look.

47:17.867 --> 47:19.600
A lot of guys running around
who look like me,

47:19.667 --> 47:22.800
you know,
I got a very familiar face.

47:24.367 --> 47:26.734
- You know, I'm divorced.
- Mm.

47:28.033 --> 47:31.300
- Yeah, I was married to Eddie
for 10 years.

47:31.367 --> 47:32.500
One day,
I'd asked him where he'd been.

47:32.567 --> 47:34.967
He goes, "Barney's",
just so fast,

47:35.033 --> 47:37.133
so convincingly,

47:37.200 --> 47:39.400
I knew immediately he was lying.

47:41.400 --> 47:42.834
- Are you calling me a liar?

47:42.900 --> 47:45.600
- Every person in this country
deserves a fair trial,

47:45.667 --> 47:47.467
deserves a good lawyer.

47:47.533 --> 47:50.133
I cannot be that lawyer for you.

47:51.567 --> 47:53.000
I'll call
the public defender's office

47:53.066 --> 47:54.000
and find you someone else.

47:54.066 --> 47:55.600
- Catherine, wait a minute.

47:57.400 --> 47:59.500
I need you.

47:59.567 --> 48:02.000
- Keller, this is the one time
where your charms are useless.

48:02.066 --> 48:04.233
- Catherine.
Catherine.

48:04.300 --> 48:06.834
Catherine!

48:09.066 --> 48:12.100
- Toby.
- Hey.

48:14.667 --> 48:16.934
- Look, I just--
I wanted to let you know

48:17.000 --> 48:19.667
that I won't be
representing Keller anymore.

48:19.734 --> 48:21.033
- Why?
What happened?

48:21.100 --> 48:23.467
- He's guilty.

48:23.533 --> 48:24.800
You know,
I made a promise to myself

48:24.867 --> 48:26.033
the day I passed the bar.

48:26.100 --> 48:27.333
I said
I was never gonna represent

48:27.400 --> 48:28.467
a guilty person,
and I'm not gonna start now.

48:28.533 --> 48:30.800
Not even for you.

48:30.867 --> 48:32.900
- I understand.

48:36.700 --> 48:39.467
- Answer me this.

48:39.533 --> 48:40.967
When I'd asked you
if he had ever discussed

48:41.033 --> 48:43.233
these murders with you,
you said no.

48:45.200 --> 48:47.066
- Yeah, I lied.

48:48.367 --> 48:49.533
Keller says so many things.

48:49.600 --> 48:50.834
Who knows what's true?

48:50.900 --> 48:53.133
- But you believe him
when he says he loves you.

48:54.367 --> 48:56.300
- Yes.

48:56.367 --> 48:59.300
- You two belong together.

48:59.367 --> 49:01.133
- Catherine.

49:01.200 --> 49:03.533
Love makes us all
do strange things.

49:03.600 --> 49:05.600
- You don't
have to tell me that.

49:07.400 --> 49:08.667
You have a good life.

49:16.467 --> 49:18.934
- You knew the woman you raped?

49:19.000 --> 49:20.433
- We used to date.

49:20.500 --> 49:22.266
We bumped into each other
at this bar,

49:22.333 --> 49:24.934
did some K, started making out,

49:25.000 --> 49:26.934
next thing I knew,
Franklin and me had her

49:27.000 --> 49:29.900
in the park,
facedown in the grass.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.800
- You know,
I never raped a woman I knew.

49:33.867 --> 49:35.467
- Adam.
- Yeah?

49:35.533 --> 49:36.467
- Can I talk to you?

49:36.533 --> 49:38.633
- I'm busy.

49:38.700 --> 49:39.800
- Two seconds.

49:43.367 --> 49:44.633
- Lovebirds.

49:44.700 --> 49:46.467
- You shouldn't be hanging out
with those guys.

49:46.533 --> 49:48.133
- Oh, instead I should
be playing backgammon

49:48.200 --> 49:49.967
with you and Busmalis?

49:50.033 --> 49:52.600
- The bikers
are Schillinger's allies.

49:52.667 --> 49:56.800
They're just being friendly
with you to try and set you up.

49:56.867 --> 49:57.967
Schillinger wants you.

49:58.033 --> 49:59.467
- You ought to know, right?

49:59.533 --> 50:01.033
Having been his prag?

50:01.100 --> 50:05.633
- Hey, Guenzel,
you and Beecher goin' on a date?

50:09.266 --> 50:10.300
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

50:10.367 --> 50:11.300
- While you're down there,

50:11.367 --> 50:13.033
suck this cock, you faggot.

50:13.100 --> 50:14.600
You cocksucker.

50:14.667 --> 50:16.066
- Ride him, cowboy!

50:16.133 --> 50:18.166
- Goal! Goal!
Goal! Goal!

50:20.467 --> 50:21.867
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

50:25.734 --> 50:27.600
- Schillinger.

50:30.900 --> 50:32.333
You made me an offer
the other day

50:32.400 --> 50:34.500
that you'd help me
get to see Keller

50:34.567 --> 50:36.000
if I gave you the boy Guenzel.

50:36.066 --> 50:37.467
- Yeah?

50:37.533 --> 50:39.266
- Is the offer still
on the table?

50:42.266 --> 50:44.900
- Jeez, I don't know.

50:44.967 --> 50:46.133
- I'll quit Sister Pete.

50:46.200 --> 50:47.367
I'll come to work for you
in the mail room.

50:47.433 --> 50:49.800
I'll call the Sicilians off.

50:54.266 --> 50:55.233
Please.

50:55.300 --> 50:57.500
- Oh, okay.

50:59.800 --> 51:03.200
- I no longer want you
to protect Adam Guenzel.

51:03.266 --> 51:04.367
- After I seen
what he did to you,

51:04.433 --> 51:05.967
I ain't surprised.

51:07.433 --> 51:08.667
The kid's a prick.

51:12.800 --> 51:14.500
- Sister?

51:14.567 --> 51:16.000
- Good morning.

51:16.066 --> 51:18.266
- There is something
I've got to talk to you about.

51:18.333 --> 51:20.133
I've decided
to quit working for you.

51:22.233 --> 51:23.300
- What?

51:23.367 --> 51:24.667
- Well, you know,

51:24.734 --> 51:26.166
I've been doing the same job
for five years,

51:26.233 --> 51:29.166
and I'm... bored.

51:30.900 --> 51:36.333
- You know, I--
I had no idea you were unhappy.

51:36.400 --> 51:37.900
- Well, I'm not unhappy.
- So--no, no, if there's--

51:37.967 --> 51:40.834
- I'm not unhappy.

51:40.900 --> 51:42.333
- Yeah.
Oh, well, all right.

51:42.400 --> 51:44.266
If you're sure about this.

51:44.333 --> 51:46.333
- I am.

51:47.600 --> 51:49.367
- Okay.

51:49.433 --> 51:50.633
When do you want to leave?

51:50.700 --> 51:52.734
- Today.

51:55.266 --> 51:56.400
- Today?

51:56.467 --> 51:58.467
- So, you want to go work
with the Aryans?

51:58.533 --> 51:59.734
- Uh-huh.

51:59.800 --> 52:00.934
Yeah, you know,
ever since we started

52:01.000 --> 52:02.133
these interactions,
Schillinger and I

52:02.200 --> 52:03.800
have been getting along
real well.

52:03.867 --> 52:06.266
- Plus, working in the mail room
will allow you to see Keller.

52:06.333 --> 52:08.900
It's okay, Beecher, because
I agree with Sister Pete.

52:08.967 --> 52:10.133
You should be allowed visits.

52:10.200 --> 52:13.100
- Yeah, but the real problem
is Adam Guenzel.

52:13.166 --> 52:15.967
I know you're gonna do
whatever you think is best,

52:16.033 --> 52:19.233
but, you know, Adam and I
just haven't been getting along.

52:20.934 --> 52:23.533
I think maybe you were right
when you said

52:23.600 --> 52:24.834
you wanted to transfer him
out of Em City.

52:24.900 --> 52:26.367
- Well, he's disruptive.

52:26.433 --> 52:28.166
I thought you two being friends
was gonna help, but--

52:28.233 --> 52:30.867
- Me too.
It hasn't worked out.

52:30.934 --> 52:33.600
- Okay, I'm gonna ship him
over to Unit B.

52:35.600 --> 52:38.133
- Schillinger.
- Yeah?

52:38.200 --> 52:39.834
- The boy's all yours.

52:41.767 --> 52:43.500
- Time for you
to deliver the mail.

52:50.633 --> 52:53.233
- Hey there, tough guy.

52:53.300 --> 52:55.500
Knock, knock.

52:56.800 --> 52:58.400
Keller!

52:58.467 --> 53:00.734
- Go away.
I don't want to play today.

53:00.800 --> 53:02.166
- Huh.

53:03.433 --> 53:05.600
- I don't want to fuck
right now.

53:05.667 --> 53:08.066
- Maybe you're forgetting
who's who here.

53:08.133 --> 53:12.266
You're my bitch,
not the other way around.

53:12.333 --> 53:15.000
I've been bringing you
little extras,

53:15.066 --> 53:17.166
and in return,

53:17.233 --> 53:20.500
you been giving me
little extras.

53:21.900 --> 53:24.967
- Don't poke me.

53:27.333 --> 53:28.633
Fucking cunt.

53:28.700 --> 53:30.133
I don't want to see
your ugly fucking face.

53:36.934 --> 53:40.700
- Central, we got a 16,
section 32.

53:44.600 --> 53:46.033
- How the mighty have fallen.

53:46.100 --> 53:47.967
- Fuck you, faggot.

53:48.033 --> 53:49.700
- Guenzel.
- Hey, Vern.

53:49.767 --> 53:51.500
The boys in Em City
send their regards.

53:51.567 --> 53:52.800
- Shut up.
- Hey, I was just--

53:52.867 --> 53:54.033
God,
what the fuck was that--

53:54.100 --> 53:55.033
- You'll speak
when you're spoken to.

53:55.100 --> 53:57.233
- Hey, get the fuck off me!

53:57.300 --> 53:58.333
Get off of me!

53:58.400 --> 54:01.433
- Sir, sir.
May I watch?

54:01.500 --> 54:04.266
- Well, if you don't,
how are you ever gonna learn?

54:04.333 --> 54:06.100
- Get the fuck off me!

54:06.166 --> 54:07.100
Get off!

54:07.166 --> 54:08.100
Fuck off!

54:30.100 --> 54:31.700
- I've got mail for Keller.

54:31.767 --> 54:32.934
- He's not here.

54:34.533 --> 54:35.467
- Where is he?

54:35.533 --> 54:37.600
- Benchley Memorial.

54:39.934 --> 54:41.367
- In the hospital?

54:41.433 --> 54:42.533
Well, what happened?

54:42.600 --> 54:44.000
- He acted up.

54:44.066 --> 54:46.100
I shut him down.

54:48.433 --> 54:49.667
