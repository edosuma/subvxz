Oh, Minh, you didn't have
to bring cookies.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.817
Hearing about all of your little Connie's
academic achievements,

01:07.901 --> 01:09.611
is all the treat that we need.

01:09.611 --> 01:12.155
Oh, no problem.
Don't want them getting stale

01:12.155 --> 01:14.407
while we go on luxury trip to Mexico.

01:14.491 --> 01:19.037
"Me-hee-co." Oh, Hank and I used to go
every time they devalued the peso.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.705
That got old pretty quick.

01:21.998 --> 01:24.542
We stay in beautiful <i>mitad</i> duplex condo

01:24.709 --> 01:26.377
with Kahn's brother and family.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.546
Mm. Oh, yes, lovely.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.840
What <i>mitad</i> mean exactly in English?

01:30.924 --> 01:32.550
First class? Deluxe?

01:33.218 --> 01:35.470
<i>Mitad...</i> hmm.

01:35.470 --> 01:38.056
You know, that's one of those words
that doesn't translate easily.

01:38.056 --> 01:38.973
Hm.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.558
Extra special luxury?

01:40.642 --> 01:44.062
It conveys the idea of simple
but relatively clean living.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.273
Ah! Stupid brother!

01:47.357 --> 01:48.942
Now he back out on the trip

01:48.942 --> 01:51.486
and we stuck with full
charge for condo rent.

01:51.486 --> 01:52.904
We can't afford that.

01:52.904 --> 01:54.948
We just bought a CD jukebox!

01:56.574 --> 01:59.452
Huh. Maybe cracker neighbor
some use after all.

02:00.036 --> 02:01.329
Howdy, neighbor.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.001
Well, sure there are some pros.

02:07.085 --> 02:10.088
It's a good deal and I guess there's
nothing tying us to the house.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.298
Now that we've got automatic sprinklers.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.050
But there's also the cons.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.845
The biggest one being, well... Kahn.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.596
Hank, I saw the brochure.

02:18.721 --> 02:22.475
The condo is two stories and very <i>mitad.</i>

02:22.559 --> 02:24.018
You would barely have to see him.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.730
If we stayed home, I wouldn't
have to see him at all.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.983
I can't think
of a better vacation than that.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.403
But it's also an opportunity
to learn about another culture.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.531
Now, the last time Bobby went to Mexico,
he was still on the breast.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.617
I love Mexico.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.537
They fast-track new makeup
straight to the consumer.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.165
Here, the FDA tests and tests for years.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.083
It's like they don't care how we look.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.710
Oh, come on, Hank.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.254
I can finally replace
that papier-mache pear I got

02:51.254 --> 02:53.464
when I was an exchange student in Oaxaca.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.717
Come on, Dad, it's the real-life home

02:55.717 --> 02:57.552
of TV's Monsignor Martinez.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.015
Well, okay, if you all want to go,

03:02.015 --> 03:04.767
I guess it's <i>buenos dias,</i> Mexico.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.270
Oh, Hank... I'm sorry,

03:07.270 --> 03:10.607
but you just said good Gods, Mexico.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.779
Wish I could go
on a luxury Mexican vacation.

03:16.863 --> 03:20.617
Must be pretty expensive
to stay in one of those <i>mitad</i> condos.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.536
Must cost at least 500 bucks.

03:24.412 --> 03:26.164
Maybe you got it for 350?

03:27.040 --> 03:28.166
How much you paying?

03:28.166 --> 03:30.084
I'll tell you what, man.
About Mexico, man.

03:30.168 --> 03:32.670
You go down and you load up
on those dang ol' chiclets, man

03:32.754 --> 03:33.880
that's why you go down there.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.757
Wheelin' and dealin'
with them dang ol' Azcolt,

03:35.757 --> 03:37.800
talking about, <i>un camino, dos mujeres.</i>

03:38.176 --> 03:40.178
I think it's nice
that you're going away, Hank.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.013
You... you need a good vacation

03:42.013 --> 03:45.767
with your new best friend Kahn,
who you love so much.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.144
Yes, Bill, I love Kahn.

03:48.436 --> 03:49.938
- Maybe if this trip works out,

03:49.938 --> 03:52.357
I'll marry him and live in Mexico forever.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.025
Is that what you want to hear?

03:54.776 --> 03:55.610
No.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.830
Every time I try to pass,
hillbilly woman speed up.

04:07.914 --> 04:08.831
Don't be silly.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.708
Peggy Hill not even thinking about you.

04:17.548 --> 04:21.135
- Whoo, think again, hotshot.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.060
Did you see that?

04:29.435 --> 04:30.770
Hey! No fair!

04:30.770 --> 04:33.439
You're making a mockery
of the breakdown lane!

04:34.440 --> 04:36.943
Why is there such a big fence, Dad?

04:36.943 --> 04:39.904
Well, millions of people come to America

04:39.988 --> 04:41.656
in search of a better life,

04:41.656 --> 04:44.075
and we've decided we don't need that many.

04:44.075 --> 04:47.245
Did the souphanousinphones
come through the fence?

04:47.245 --> 04:50.164
No, Bobby, Kahn applied the legal way.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.458
Sometimes the system fails us.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.674
Hey, check out this dangerous character!

04:59.674 --> 05:00.800
Ooh...

05:01.175 --> 05:03.386
Watch out!
You think he running guns?

05:04.679 --> 05:07.432
Sir, pull your vehicle over
to the inspection area, please.

05:07.974 --> 05:08.975
He was joking.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.601
Tell him you were joking, Kahn.

05:10.685 --> 05:13.021
Ah, let him look, you got nothing to hide.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.355
See you at condo!

05:22.322 --> 05:23.781
Don't steal the towels.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.450
You take, I charge.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.618
This is a mini-bar.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.746
You use, you pay.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.415
Now for the tour of the condo.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.042
Condo.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.127
-Wait a minute.
-Where the rest of it?

05:36.127 --> 05:39.380
I paid for <i>mitad</i> condo, two floors.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.716
This condo plenty mitad
But only one floor.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.301
What are you trying to pull?

05:43.301 --> 05:44.385
Old bait and switch?

05:44.469 --> 05:47.930
<i>Mitad. Mitad</i> means half.

05:48.389 --> 05:50.350
Just downstairs, not upstairs.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.685
<i>- Tu comprendes?</i>
- Just downstairs?

05:52.769 --> 05:56.064
I can't spend whole weekend squished side
by side with a redneck neighbor.

05:56.397 --> 05:59.734
No, no, no. No, don't worry
about any redneck neighbor.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.652
Nobody's rented the upstairs.

06:02.236 --> 06:03.529
It's completely vacant.

06:03.613 --> 06:04.989
But...

06:05.073 --> 06:06.491
Where other bathroom?

06:06.491 --> 06:07.950
Oh, there's only one bathroom.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.328
But, hey, the tub is big enough
for two people.

06:20.004 --> 06:23.591
I come to see Mexico,
not Hank Hill squeezing

06:23.591 --> 06:26.260
this year's butt into
last year's swimsuit.

06:30.056 --> 06:33.851
Oh, no. You're not getting the upstairs
not after what you did to me

06:33.935 --> 06:35.186
back there at the border.

06:35.186 --> 06:38.022
Okay, you take
high-class penthouse with view.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.440
We take downstairs hovel.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.528
Here's key. Lock little sticky.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.405
You got to rake it
like there's no tomorrow.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.281
This is a car key.

06:47.365 --> 06:50.201
Yeah, you win new car. This big game show.
Just rake it, stupid.

06:51.369 --> 06:55.415
Huh. Well, it probably
just needs a little WD-40.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.501
Peggy, which bag has our bathroom stuff?

07:01.421 --> 07:02.380
Come on, kids.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.258
Andelay. We're off
to the papier-mache district.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.052
- We got to sneak off on our own, Bobby.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.346
Mom, can Connie and I go...

07:10.430 --> 07:12.306
play... volleyball?

07:13.808 --> 07:15.101
Well, all right.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.812
Just make sure to apply
plenty of sunscreen, honey.

07:17.812 --> 07:20.189
We are much closer
to the sun here than in Texas.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.459
Ugh. This market is way too tacky.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.335
They are not going to have
papier-mache pears.

07:46.674 --> 07:47.592
Oh, my god!

07:47.592 --> 07:48.759
Le Leche Del Sol!

07:49.343 --> 07:51.846
The illegal beauty secret of the stars.

08:00.938 --> 08:03.232
Look, Bobby, firecrackers.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.114
<i>Bueno!</i>

08:10.198 --> 08:11.199
M-80s!

08:11.199 --> 08:13.075
Those are a quarter stick of dynamite.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.204
Oh, my gosh!

08:16.746 --> 08:18.080
<i>La bomba.</i>

08:18.164 --> 08:19.916
Those can blow your whole arm off.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.345
<i>Vaya con dios.</i>

08:45.650 --> 08:47.109
Hey, this is a beer,

08:47.193 --> 08:48.528
not a fruit salad.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.239
Why can't you find your own bar?

08:51.239 --> 08:53.491
I have same coupon book as you.

08:53.491 --> 08:54.742
I just want a beer.

08:54.742 --> 08:57.078
This a free country. Isn't it?

08:58.829 --> 09:00.706
- Huh? Oh, no!

09:00.790 --> 09:02.208
No, I don't want this.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.378
No, no, look. If you want to make money,
play for that guy.

09:05.753 --> 09:06.879
He's rich.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.214
<i>Mucho dinnero.</i>

09:14.095 --> 09:17.139
What? Oh, no, no.
You think I'm a sucker?

09:17.223 --> 09:20.017
Ah, you sing for me, I sing for you.

Let's blow that up.

09:28.943 --> 09:32.029
If this were a cherry bomb, I'd say yes.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.532
But this is La Bomba.

09:36.784 --> 09:37.785
Hmm. Nah.

Ohh. Hmm.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.002
Ooh.

Pretty good job, Kahn.

10:16.282 --> 10:19.660
I've never heard that song
with only one note before.

10:19.744 --> 10:20.870
Yeah, it all about rhythm.

10:21.662 --> 10:25.082
Bartender, two <i>cervezas, por favor.</i>

10:36.594 --> 10:39.221
These are all authentic,
locally crafted masks.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.683
In our culture they have social
and religious importance.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.227
Mm-hm. Yeah, that's nice.
Have you got pears?

10:45.311 --> 10:48.564
Uh, right. you're here
for the papier-mache pear.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.482
Uh-huh.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.400
Well, the pears are not sold separately.

10:52.109 --> 10:53.653
Oh, it's perfect.

10:55.112 --> 10:57.198
Oh, <i>muchos, muchos, gracias.</i>

10:57.406 --> 10:58.783
I'm not even going to haggle.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.326
I have to pay for the frog, right?

11:00.326 --> 11:01.535
- Yes.
- Of course.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.037
It is so beautiful.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.289
I, I really... I don't know
how I can thank you.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.917
<i>Senora.</i> I have a friend just
across the border.

11:08.250 --> 11:11.170
And I don't trust the mail.
The address is on the box.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.588
Would you deliver it for me?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.465
Well, that would be my pleasure, <i>amigo.</i>

11:14.465 --> 11:15.383
<i>Gracias.</i>

11:15.383 --> 11:17.635
Oh, my, it's wrapped prettily, isn't it?

11:18.219 --> 11:19.929
I wonder what is in it.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.681
I tell you what's in there.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.141
Cocaine, black tar, PCP, you name it.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.268
I see <i>Twenty/Twenty</i> special
all about this.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.687
You're a mule, Peggy Hill.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.987
Hank? Hank Hill, is that you?

11:37.071 --> 11:39.407
Dale? What are you doing here?

11:39.407 --> 11:41.033
I was just out for a drive.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.411
Thought this place
might have clean facilities.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.663
Talk about a coincidence.

11:45.663 --> 11:48.207
It's a nine-hour drive, Dale.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.166
Is it?

11:49.250 --> 11:50.751
I guess I better stay then.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.805
I think it's a dud.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.599
Yeah. Let's give it 15 more minutes.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.608
Hey, you. You skinny <i>gringo.</i>

12:14.692 --> 12:15.568
I don't know you.

12:15.568 --> 12:16.485
Are you a guest?

12:16.569 --> 12:19.155
I'm staying with the Hills in Five-B.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.741
Five-B? Upstairs?

12:22.491 --> 12:24.577
Damn <i>turistas!</i>
You try to rip me off!

12:24.577 --> 12:25.619
It'll be last time...

12:25.703 --> 12:28.122
Somebody missed his siesta.

12:38.424 --> 12:41.886
Boy, now I know why
they call it beach volleyball.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.346
Volleyball is really fun.

12:44.930 --> 12:45.931
Bobby, come here.

12:46.223 --> 12:47.892
Honey, do you think I'm naive?

12:47.892 --> 12:49.310
No.

12:49.310 --> 12:52.605
Am I just a fool who believes
whatever I'm told?

12:52.605 --> 12:53.731
I'm sorry.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.066
Why on earth did I trust that man?

12:56.150 --> 12:58.235
There could be anything
in this package. Anything.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.113
I am so <i>estupido.</i>

13:01.197 --> 13:02.406
Oh!

13:02.782 --> 13:04.950
Hmm, they had to kill ten turtles,

13:05.034 --> 13:06.494
to fill one little jar.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.162
Neat.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.126
Oh, my god! It's the police!

13:14.210 --> 13:16.879
They know I tried to blow up
one of their monuments!

13:16.879 --> 13:19.673
No, no, they think I'm a makeup smuggler!

13:19.757 --> 13:20.758
Get out of my way!

13:24.595 --> 13:26.305
We all have to put on lots of makeup.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.725
This tastes like turtles.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.019
What in the heck is going on?

13:32.019 --> 13:33.354
I was never here.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.273
Peggy Hill is nobody's mule.

13:38.567 --> 13:39.735
A pear?

13:39.819 --> 13:42.613
Come on out here, everyone.
Come on, get out here.

13:46.408 --> 13:48.452
We have nothing to hide.

13:52.122 --> 13:53.749
You will pay the condo manager

13:53.833 --> 13:55.626
- 8,000 pesos.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.670
But if the key fit, you must acquit.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.380
10,000 pesos.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.757
Bailiff. Confiscate their identification.

14:03.968 --> 14:06.428
Look, let's just pay
the money and go home.

14:06.637 --> 14:09.098
My money not fluid.
Take weeks to raise funds.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.307
You pay. I owe you.

14:10.391 --> 14:11.350
I can't cover it.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.352
If I could get back to Arlen,

14:13.352 --> 14:15.229
I could have them garnish my wages.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.647
But we can't leave the country.

14:16.647 --> 14:17.815
They took our I.D.

14:18.023 --> 14:21.777
Are you kidding? We won't have any trouble
driving through that checkpoint.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.405
They'll wave us through
pretty as you please.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.573
Really?

14:25.573 --> 14:28.742
Well, Hank and me 'cause we're Angloid.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.453
You they'll haul out
and give the third degree.

14:31.537 --> 14:35.207
Maybe it'll be safer if we all split up.
Dale, you come with me.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.625
Kahn, you're on your own.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.377
Hey, Hill, you can't leave me.

14:38.377 --> 14:39.753
We Americans, Hank.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.046
No lime in our beer, remember?

14:41.130 --> 14:43.507
And we sure sent those mariachis running.

14:46.093 --> 14:47.219
Help me, Hank.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.265
- Bye-bye.
- You all get going now.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.934
Dale, Kahn and I will be along
after we, uh...

14:54.268 --> 14:56.395
Clear up that little misunderstanding.

15:02.943 --> 15:05.195
I don't think this such a good idea.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.323
Yeah? Well, here's another idea.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.824
We go on without you.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.451
Okay, all right, I get in.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.372
<i>♪ Doo-doo-doo-dooo ♪</i>

15:15.623 --> 15:17.166
<i>♪ Poetry in motion ♪</i>

15:17.166 --> 15:18.500
<i>♪ Deet-doot-doot-doot ♪</i>

15:19.043 --> 15:20.169
<i>-♪ She blinded me... ♪</i>
- Pothole.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.253
<i>♪ With sci...! ♪</i>

15:22.755 --> 15:26.592
Now just follow my lead and play it cool.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.385
What if they find Kahn?

15:28.469 --> 15:32.056
If I know my Mexican legal system,
which I do,

15:32.056 --> 15:35.643
we'll get about 15 years
with a starvation diet

15:35.643 --> 15:38.062
of moldy bread and warm water.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.146
Distilled water?

15:39.313 --> 15:41.523
No. And of course,

15:41.690 --> 15:45.444
there is a total lack of toilet paper
and privacy.

15:45.444 --> 15:48.781
Oh, god, I can't go while people watch.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.367
Then let me do the talking.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.537
Morning.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.914
Where are you gentlemen from?

15:57.456 --> 15:58.791
Arlen, Texas.

15:59.416 --> 16:00.250
I've been to Arlen.

16:00.793 --> 16:01.627
Nice town.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.587
- Run!

16:23.941 --> 16:25.317
I think we lost them.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.443
We'll be okay.

16:26.527 --> 16:27.695
Okay?

16:27.695 --> 16:29.196
We're screwed!

16:29.196 --> 16:30.948
No. We're American.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.741
We got to find a pay phone,

16:32.825 --> 16:35.536
and hope Ross Perot's
800 number's still working.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.454
Why you want to call that nut for?

16:37.913 --> 16:38.956
Border right there.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.250
Millions of people cross over every day.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.626
We can, too. No big deal.

16:42.710 --> 16:43.836
Illegally?

16:43.836 --> 16:44.837
No!

16:44.837 --> 16:47.756
America is my country and I love her.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.010
I wouldn't enter her
in any way that's unnatural.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.511
We have no choice, Hank.

16:52.511 --> 16:55.347
The I.N.S had their cameras trained on us.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.391
The border guards think we're smugglers.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.977
I'm too pretty to go to jail!

17:08.736 --> 17:10.070
Uh, excuse me

17:10.154 --> 17:12.865
uh. What did it cost you
to rent those mopeds?

17:13.490 --> 17:15.534
Uh, actually, we own these.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.327
But we are looking to sell them.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.872
Well, maybe we can help each other out.

17:20.414 --> 17:23.208
Only thing is we're
a little short on cash.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.421
That watch belonged to my grandfather.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.215
That was my only pair
of button-fly jeans.

17:32.342 --> 17:33.302
Hey, what...

17:33.302 --> 17:34.595
What happened to our mopeds?

17:39.558 --> 17:40.976
Hey, look at me.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.103
Look at me!

17:44.313 --> 17:46.690
Somebody look at me!

17:50.110 --> 17:51.320
Did you see?

17:51.320 --> 17:54.239
Yeah, Dale, you looked really cool.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.076
For your next trick why
don't I kick your ass?

17:57.618 --> 18:00.245
Get on the back, Kahn.
Dale, you're lucky Pierre.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.288
Oh, man.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.379
Ah, it'd be faster if we walk.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.590
Ow!

18:11.590 --> 18:13.008
Did you see? Did you see?

18:25.729 --> 18:28.482
Uh, have we just been captured?

18:59.763 --> 19:00.764
Wait, Hank!

19:00.848 --> 19:03.016
I... I can't swim.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.018
Of course you can't.

19:06.770 --> 19:10.816
Ah, look at mighty river.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.360
So, much beauty.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.820
So much power.

19:15.779 --> 19:17.239
Humbles a man, huh, Hank?

19:18.991 --> 19:20.200
You a good friend, Hank.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.161
And friendship based on truth.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.454
I broke into top condo on purpose

19:24.872 --> 19:25.998
and I'm sorry.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.166
What?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.750
Damn you, Kahn!

19:28.834 --> 19:30.711
This whole thing is your fault!

19:36.633 --> 19:39.136
I thought you said you couldn't swim.

19:39.136 --> 19:41.221
Yeah, I big fat liar.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.185
Ugh, this river is filthy.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.478
Look at this, underwear floating around.

19:48.562 --> 19:51.106
Uh, Hank, a little help here.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.568
He won't last two days in the U.S.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.451
America.

20:02.451 --> 20:03.493
Texas.

20:04.536 --> 20:05.370
Home.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.707
Look how easy it is
to get into this country.

20:08.707 --> 20:11.877
Oh, I can't believe I had to learn
the Bill of Rights.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.378
Where am I going to use that?

20:13.462 --> 20:17.382
You'd be surprised, Kahn.
I take the fifth on a daily basis.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.987
Hurry up, Hank,
the border guards are coming.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.282
You got to give me a hand. Dale?

20:45.202 --> 20:48.038
Dale! Dale! Wait! I can't do it alone!

20:48.872 --> 20:50.749
Gribble gone. Take my hand.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.052
Welcome to land of opportunity, Hank.

21:09.935 --> 21:10.769
Yep.

21:11.645 --> 21:12.479
Mm-hmm.

21:13.355 --> 21:14.189
Yep.

21:14.690 --> 21:15.565
Yep.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.484
You know what's funny?

21:17.484 --> 21:19.903
This time, I on Texas soil first.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.738
He's the immigrant.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.031
I smuggle him in.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.533
Very funny, Kahn.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.535
Hey, I live next door to alien.

21:26.535 --> 21:27.869
My property worth nothing now.

21:27.953 --> 21:28.829
Ha-ha.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.664
Ah, you get in baby way.

21:31.248 --> 21:32.916
I had to memorize all presidents.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.418
You couldn't do it.

21:34.418 --> 21:37.462
That stretch between
Polk and Buchanan wipe you out.

21:37.879 --> 21:39.298
You ever hear of Garfield?

21:39.298 --> 21:41.216
He more than cartoon cat, you know.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.427
He part of history of my country.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.260
<i>Vaya con dios.</i>
