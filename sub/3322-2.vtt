01:11.640 --> 01:14.610
Let's go find out what your
brother Hvitserk is doing.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.165
All right.

01:18.280 --> 01:20.362
Ubbe, go find
your brother.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.331
He's here.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.164
Hello, Hvitserk.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.321
(LAUGHING)

01:51.520 --> 01:53.727
The ax is much better

And the range!

Torstein.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.770
Torstein, you're standing
in the way of the fire.

02:06.840 --> 02:08.170
As usual.

02:09.199 --> 02:10.850
Hello, Priest.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.970
(IN NATIVE TONGUE)

02:13.320 --> 02:14.321
Ooh!

02:14.400 --> 02:16.368
Why do you still
say such things?

02:16.720 --> 02:19.803
So where is he?
Where is our earl?

02:20.760 --> 02:22.046
Behind you.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.731
Hey,Ubbe!

02:24.840 --> 02:26.251
Hello, Floki.
Hey.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.645
We've kind of missed you.

02:28.720 --> 02:31.121
Well, I've been
busy like a dwarf,

02:31.360 --> 02:34.125
building your new boats,
Ragnar Lothbrok,

02:34.200 --> 02:35.804
even in the ice
and the snow.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.770
So busy,

02:37.840 --> 02:39.922
yet he still has so
much time to complain.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.001
The boats
are nearly finished.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.368
I think we all want to know where
we'll be raiding this summer.

02:46.440 --> 02:48.124
Every year,
all your people wonder

02:48.240 --> 02:49.969
when you will
order another raid west

02:50.040 --> 02:52.168
and every year
you disappoint them.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.049
I've even heard
some people say

02:54.680 --> 02:57.809
that Earl Ragnar is becoming
like Earl Haraldson.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.764
Let me put
their minds at ease.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.285
You should.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.124
Welcome, everyone.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.330
As you all know,
it has taken a long time

03:13.400 --> 03:15.129
to prepare ourselves.

03:16.080 --> 03:18.003
To build our ships,

03:18.080 --> 03:22.005
and to replace the young men
that we lost to the plague.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.766
But now, now we are ready,

03:27.800 --> 03:31.202
and this summer we shall
finally go west again.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.169
(ALL CHEERING)

03:33.480 --> 03:35.881
We will return to England,

03:35.960 --> 03:40.568
for that land was so generous
to us the last time. (LAUGHING)

03:40.840 --> 03:43.047
But this time,
we shall not go alone.

03:43.160 --> 03:47.768
For King Horik and Jarl Borg
have agreed to join us.

03:49.320 --> 03:53.086
And perhaps we will not have
to return so quickly,

03:53.160 --> 03:55.401
but stay in their
land for a while,

03:55.480 --> 03:58.848
explore it,
maybe even winter there.

03:58.920 --> 04:00.410
Who knows?

04:00.480 --> 04:04.371
But, I tell you,
these are interesting times.

04:04.440 --> 04:07.489
The world is changing
and we must change with it.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.129
We must act together,

04:14.840 --> 04:17.491
for everyone's sake.

04:21.120 --> 04:24.488
And now that I have
put your minds to rest,

04:26.360 --> 04:28.601
who is hungry?

Uppsala.

05:44.560 --> 05:45.561
Thank you.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.087
How hungry you are, husband.

05:56.840 --> 05:58.126
What is wrong with that?

05:58.920 --> 06:00.126
Nothing.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.129
What were you
talking about with her?

06:11.280 --> 06:14.841
We were talking about
movements in the shield-wall.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.970
Girl, bring me
some more food.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.200
I have to eat for two.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.646
Yes, my Lady.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.645
Well, as you can see,
l am being very well-served.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.522
Now, come. Sit. Join us.

What is what?

07:36.840 --> 07:38.046
You...

07:40.200 --> 07:44.205
You are acting
very strangely.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.803
You think it is strange
for a pregnant woman

07:49.880 --> 07:52.884
to want her husband
to be supportive and kind?

07:54.080 --> 07:55.161
No.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.967
Then why do you think
I'm acting strangely?

08:00.240 --> 08:01.446
I don't know.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.409
You don't know you're
flirting with other women

08:03.480 --> 08:05.005

you want to bed them?

Tell your beautiful mother that
I am not doing what she thinks.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.683
Yes, you are.

08:36.760 --> 08:39.366
Women know these things.

08:39.440 --> 08:42.409
I know it especially,
because I have certain gifts.

They say that völvas practice
forbidden sexual rites.

09:10.560 --> 09:12.130
Shall I stay awake?

09:12.720 --> 09:14.563
The fact is, you want to
sleep with that girl,

09:14.640 --> 09:18.008
even though she is barely
above a slave girl.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.764
That is such
an insult to me.

09:23.120 --> 09:25.805
I do not want to
sleep with that girl,

09:26.720 --> 09:28.643

09:33.120 --> 09:35.043
Good night, little one.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.970
And now I'm going to sleep.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.649
I won't let you sleep
until I have told you this.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.523
I will bear you
another son.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.604
If you like, you can feel
him stirring in my belly.

09:55.680 --> 09:59.844
But, because you treat me like
an idiot, I make this prophecy.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.922
My father killed
the dragon Fafnir,

10:02.000 --> 10:06.369
and our new son will be born with the
image of the serpent in his eye.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.685
This much I know.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.966
and unearths me to sorrows?

10:38.360 --> 10:39.361
Ah.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.442
It is you, Ragnar Lothbrok.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.850
What do you want?

10:46.040 --> 10:47.804
Are you not content?

10:48.360 --> 10:51.648
Look at what you have.
Is it not enough?

10:52.680 --> 10:54.330
The gods have
given me sons,

10:54.400 --> 10:56.050
as they promised.

10:56.280 --> 11:00.410
But I want to know what the future holds.
What will become of them?

11:00.960 --> 11:05.249
The sons of Ragnar Lothbrok
will be spoken of

11:05.320 --> 11:09.325
as long as men
have tongues to speak.

11:12.600 --> 11:16.047
They will enjoy
that much fame?

11:16.480 --> 11:19.609
One of them will marry
the daughter of a king.

11:20.480 --> 11:24.644
Another will discover
and sail around the sea

11:24.720 --> 11:26.643
that has no tides.

11:27.720 --> 11:31.441
All this and more
have I foreseen.

11:31.520 --> 11:35.320
Then they will have more
fame than I, their father?

11:36.680 --> 11:38.011
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

11:38.880 --> 11:40.530
What about Bjorn?

11:41.120 --> 11:42.531
What about my son Bjorn?

11:43.200 --> 11:44.281
What of him?

11:47.120 --> 11:48.724
Is he alive?

11:48.800 --> 11:52.009
It was of him
I was speaking.

11:53.240 --> 11:55.129
Will l ever
see him again?

11:55.520 --> 11:58.046
You ask too many questions.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.570
I have said enough.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.329
See for yourself.
Not today.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.606
You're a disgrace.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.209
I have lost everything.

12:38.880 --> 12:42.726
My sons, my husband,
finally my daughter.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.961
I am not going
to lose you.

12:53.880 --> 12:57.327
Yesterday your brother spoke
of the summer's raid.

12:57.400 --> 13:00.244
He's going west again,
with King Horik.

13:00.320 --> 13:03.085
You must ask him to
take you with him.

13:05.440 --> 13:06.965
Look at me.

13:07.280 --> 13:10.807
You will look better if you
have something to believe in.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.531
I am giving you
a choice, Rollo.

13:17.960 --> 13:22.204
Go and speak
with your brother, or...

13:27.400 --> 13:29.050
Or take this blade,

13:29.640 --> 13:31.881
push it into
your ribs right now.

I just thought...
Everyone.

14:56.640 --> 14:59.849
Well, are you going
to take a seat?

15:10.840 --> 15:11.841
(SIGHS)

15:11.920 --> 15:16.209
So, where have you been
for so long, brother?

15:16.280 --> 15:18.408
Carrying around
my heavy heart,

15:20.080 --> 15:21.809
cursing the gods,

15:23.320 --> 15:24.890
cursing myself,

15:28.000 --> 15:31.209
and then drinking ale until
I almost forgot everything.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.962
So why are you here now?

15:38.040 --> 15:39.690
I am your brother.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.569
You chose
to fight against me.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.203
I remember
when we were boys,

15:48.320 --> 15:50.721
we often fought
against each other.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.882
Isn't that always
the way with brothers?

15:55.160 --> 15:58.209
They hate and love
each other all the time.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.042
You could have killed me,

16:02.120 --> 16:03.451
like you killed One-Eye.

16:04.320 --> 16:06.607
I could never
have killed you.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.842
Tell me, why should I
ever trust you again?

16:14.720 --> 16:16.449
Because I ask you to.

16:16.520 --> 16:18.921
Shouldn't you be
asking for forgiveness

16:20.440 --> 16:22.647
after everything
you have done?

16:22.720 --> 16:26.281
I ask only for the opportunity
to regain your respect,

16:28.960 --> 16:31.531
to fight beside
you again in battle.

16:34.840 --> 16:36.444
I have nothing.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.930
You have suffered.

16:43.080 --> 16:47.483
But many people suffered more
because of what you did.

16:56.520 --> 16:58.249
Let me think on it.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.207
Then I'll give you
my decision.

I don't want to stay here
with the old people.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.691

come in useful.

I have waited an eternity already.
Ah.

19:11.760 --> 19:15.003
I said to my sons, hmm,
"I have to set off.

"I cannot even wait
for the ice to melt."

together and I've come to honor it.

The last time we met,
Jarl Borg,

19:57.120 --> 19:58.360
I had the distasteful task

19:58.440 --> 20:00.920
of burying many
of my kinsmen and friends.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.131

four years,

20:03.240 --> 20:05.891
I've been paying you

to see you.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.611

20:25.400 --> 20:27.050
Is this not Rollo,

20:27.160 --> 20:28.730
the brother who
fought against us?

20:29.160 --> 20:30.400
Yes.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.525
And you spared his life?

20:33.880 --> 20:36.531
The gods spared his life.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.404
What is your decision?

20:42.440 --> 20:44.488
I accept you back, Rollo.

20:44.560 --> 20:47.166
I acknowledge you
as my brother,

20:47.240 --> 20:48.890

it is the greatest privilege and
honor to be seated beside you,

Such a compliment from a man
like you is always welcome.

21:50.480 --> 21:53.051
Mmm. Oh, it is true.
I have also slain dragons,

21:53.120 --> 21:54.724

21:54.800 --> 21:56.165

22:03.240 --> 22:05.607

22:06.160 --> 22:08.686
Will this be
your first raid?

22:08.760 --> 22:11.730
Yes. I can't wait to
prove myself in battle.

22:12.880 --> 22:14.325
I want my father
to be proud of me.

22:15.160 --> 22:18.050
I have a son

Where is he?
I would like to meet him.

22:24.080 --> 22:26.082
I do not know
where he is.

22:27.240 --> 22:28.685
That is by his choice.

22:31.280 --> 22:33.931
I should never have
mentioned him. Drink.

22:38.480 --> 22:39.970
I have made a decision.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.931
I do not wish Jarl Borg
to raid with us.

22:44.880 --> 22:47.281
But we had an agreement.
Why not?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.401
Why do you not want
your brother beside you?

22:51.120 --> 22:52.246
Because you don't
trust him enough.

22:52.320 --> 22:54.482
It is the same
for me with Jarl Borg.

22:54.600 --> 22:57.524
I cannot bring myself
to trust him completely.

22:57.640 --> 23:00.166
You must inform him
of our decision.

24:08.600 --> 24:10.523
Forgive me, Jarl Borg,

24:12.040 --> 24:14.884
but we have decided
not to seek your help.

24:21.280 --> 24:22.884
I thought we had
an agreement.

24:22.960 --> 24:25.850
It is not my desire
to break that agreement.

I wish it to remain intact.

43:09.240 --> 43:12.483
(IN NATIVE TONGUE)

43:47.200 --> 43:49.885
What have you heard
about King Ecbert?

43:53.040 --> 43:54.849
That he's just like you.

44:17.560 --> 44:19.847
What on earth
has caused you

44:19.920 --> 44:23.402
to bring your muddy boots
into my bathhouse?

44:25.200 --> 44:26.804
Forgive me, sire.

44:26.880 --> 44:29.406
But the Northmen
have come ashore in Wessex.

44:29.520 --> 44:31.966
They defeated
a large force of our men.

44:33.040 --> 44:36.610
They are here.
