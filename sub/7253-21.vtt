00:00.876 --> 00:02.169
<i>Previously on "Gilmore Girls"..</i>

00:02.210 --> 00:03.671
I'll be out of cellphone range

00:02.210 --> 00:03.671
for a couple days.

00:03.712 --> 00:05.547
- I know.

00:03.712 --> 00:05.547
- I'll see you.

00:05.589 --> 00:07.508
Logan's hurt. Something happened

00:05.589 --> 00:07.508
on their trip.

00:07.549 --> 00:09.384
They're airlifting him

00:07.549 --> 00:09.384
to a hospital in New York.

00:09.426 --> 00:12.680
I should have stopped you.

00:09.426 --> 00:12.680
I was so busy being mad at you

00:12.721 --> 00:14.556
I didn't think

00:12.721 --> 00:14.556
I was trying to punish you

00:14.598 --> 00:15.891
but I was trying

00:14.598 --> 00:15.891
to punish you.

00:15.933 --> 00:17.518
Hey, everybody,

00:15.933 --> 00:17.518
I'm Lorelai Gilmore.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.394
I'm really glad you guys

00:17.559 --> 00:19.394
waited to start the party

00:19.436 --> 00:20.437
until I got here.

00:20.479 --> 00:21.814
Anna came by the diner.

00:21.856 --> 00:23.440
- 'She's really mad.'

00:21.856 --> 00:23.440
- What about?

00:23.482 --> 00:25.024
She says she feels betrayed

00:25.066 --> 00:27.027
because they let you throw

00:25.066 --> 00:27.027
April a birthday party

00:27.068 --> 00:28.487
'even though

00:27.068 --> 00:28.487
she's never met you.'

00:28.529 --> 00:31.239
Luke and I, we are engaged.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.239
We are stable.

00:31.281 --> 00:35.410
Engaged isn't married.

00:31.281 --> 00:35.410
People get engaged all the time.

00:35.452 --> 00:38.873
How can you possibly say she

00:35.452 --> 00:38.873
looked better with dark hair?

00:38.914 --> 00:41.000
The blonde just seemed like

00:38.914 --> 00:41.000
she was trying to be her sister.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.418
Dark hair makes it look like

00:41.041 --> 00:43.418
she's too hard not to like her

00:43.460 --> 00:44.962
sister, plus she does not have

00:43.460 --> 00:44.962
the nose for dark hair.

00:45.004 --> 00:46.380
What does that mean?

00:46.421 --> 00:48.590
Dark hair is like

00:46.421 --> 00:48.590
a giant light-up arrow

00:48.632 --> 00:50.384
pointing to

00:48.632 --> 00:50.384
what is wrong with you.

00:50.425 --> 00:53.178
Blond hair, it all sort of

00:50.425 --> 00:53.178
blends in in a haze of beige.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.931
- Nuts. You're nuts.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.931
- You're double nuts!

00:55.973 --> 00:58.976
Alright, that's it.

00:55.973 --> 00:58.976
No more spaghetti and meatballs.

00:59.018 --> 01:01.436
- Musepa, come get these plates.

00:59.018 --> 01:01.436
- Mom!

01:01.478 --> 01:03.647
Every time we have spaghetti

01:01.478 --> 01:03.647
and meatballs, you fight.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.816
No, no, we're not fighting.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.816
We're just, uh, bonding.

01:05.858 --> 01:08.027
Mmm! Grandma, I'm starving!

01:08.068 --> 01:09.611
Take these away.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.611
Mr. Gilmore's also.

01:09.653 --> 01:11.655
- Mom, come on.

01:09.653 --> 01:11.655
- I won't fight anymore.

01:11.697 --> 01:14.157
No. Spaghetti and meatballs

01:11.697 --> 01:14.157
is just too much excitement.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.492
I'm sorry about that.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.202
I left work early today,

01:15.534 --> 01:17.202
and apparently

01:17.244 --> 01:19.705
that caused everyone's

01:17.244 --> 01:19.705
IQ's to drop 60 points.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.790
Ooh. My food is gone.

01:21.832 --> 01:23.333
Girls were fighting.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.084
Well, I told you not to

01:23.375 --> 01:25.084
serve spaghetti and meatballs.

01:25.126 --> 01:26.587
They always fight when we have

01:25.126 --> 01:26.587
spaghetti and meatballs.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.171
That's not true.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.089
We fight just as much

01:28.213 --> 01:30.089
when we have Chinese food.

01:30.131 --> 01:31.926
Can we please talk about

01:30.131 --> 01:31.926
something besides food?

01:31.967 --> 01:34.302
Starvation, scurvy,

01:31.967 --> 01:34.302
the Donner party.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.513
I'm having Lasik surgery

01:34.344 --> 01:36.513
on my eyes.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.432
- Excellent topic.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.432
- 'Lasik surgery? Why?'

01:38.473 --> 01:40.017
Well, I hate wearing glasses

01:40.059 --> 01:41.852
so I found the best doctor

01:40.059 --> 01:41.852
on the East coast

01:41.894 --> 01:43.771
made an appointment,

01:41.894 --> 01:43.771
and I'm going in tomorrow.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.731
Personally,

01:43.812 --> 01:45.731
I like you with glasses.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.942
It's that whole "dirty

01:45.773 --> 01:47.942
librarian" thing, right, dad?

01:47.983 --> 01:49.693
I beg your pardon.

01:49.735 --> 01:52.654
Three of the girls in my DAR

01:49.735 --> 01:52.654
group had it done already.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.364
I'm actually

01:52.696 --> 01:54.364
very excited about it.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.825
- I got Dr. Morris.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.825
- The "Lasik Man".

01:56.867 --> 01:59.160
From Dr. Sugarman, who's

01:56.867 --> 01:59.160
my ear, nose, and throat man.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.663
And he said Dr. Morris is

01:59.202 --> 02:01.663
brilliant and very handsome.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.290
You never told me this.

02:03.331 --> 02:04.959
Well, he just threw it in

02:03.331 --> 02:04.959
at the end of the visit.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.919
I think that's

02:05.000 --> 02:06.919
incredibly unprofessional.

02:06.961 --> 02:09.588
Oh, Richard, he just was saying

02:06.961 --> 02:09.588
the man is handsome.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.256
Yes, as if it's a selling point.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.300
- It can be.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.300
- Hardly.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.594
Everyone knows ugly men

02:13.341 --> 02:15.594
make the best doctors.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.471
- That's absurd.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.471
- It's a fact.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.514
Marcus Welby was handsome.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.514
And George Clooney.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.016
Fake doctors, mom.

02:21.058 --> 02:22.977
Well, I'm sure they were modeled

02:21.058 --> 02:22.977
after real doctors.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.436
I don't wanna

02:23.018 --> 02:24.436
talk about this anymore.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.271
He's jealous of Dr. Handsome.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.440
I'm not jealous of Dr. Handsome.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.984
I should go shopping

02:28.482 --> 02:29.984
for something new to wear.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.401
You are not

02:30.025 --> 02:31.401
going shopping to get

02:31.443 --> 02:33.112
something new to wear

02:31.443 --> 02:33.112
to Dr. Handsome.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.030
Everyone is

02:33.153 --> 02:35.030
a little testy tonight.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.240
Maybe she was right about

02:35.072 --> 02:37.240
the spaghetti and meatballs.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.785
Well, let's just

02:37.282 --> 02:39.785
talk about something else.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.912
We had lunch

02:39.827 --> 02:41.912
with Christopher yesterday.

02:41.954 --> 02:43.413
- You..

02:41.954 --> 02:43.413
- Lunch.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.582
- 'We took him to the club.'

02:43.455 --> 02:45.582
- Okay, but why?

02:45.624 --> 02:47.668
Because there'd been

02:45.624 --> 02:47.668
a lot of tension between us

02:47.709 --> 02:49.461
about the tuition incident

02:49.503 --> 02:51.672
and your mother and I thought

02:49.503 --> 02:51.672
it was time for a sit-down.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.715
A sit-down?

02:51.713 --> 02:53.715
What? Did you get Clemenza

02:53.757 --> 02:55.467
to hide a gun

02:53.757 --> 02:55.467
in the bathroom first?

02:55.509 --> 02:57.678
We thought it was time

02:55.509 --> 02:57.678
to clear the air.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.805
After all,

02:57.719 --> 02:59.805
Christopher is Rory's father.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.057
(Richard)

02:59.847 --> 03:02.057
'And we wanted him to know

02:59.847 --> 03:02.057
there were no hard feelings.'

03:02.099 --> 03:03.642
- Really?

03:02.099 --> 03:03.642
- 'Don't get me wrong.'

03:03.684 --> 03:05.644
We're still not happy

03:03.684 --> 03:05.644
about the situation

03:05.686 --> 03:08.229
but since he's going to be

03:05.686 --> 03:08.229
involved in our lives now--

03:08.271 --> 03:09.606
Whoa, whoa.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.606
Involved in your lives?

03:09.648 --> 03:10.983
How is he involved

03:09.648 --> 03:10.983
in your lives?

03:11.025 --> 03:12.818
Well, he's paying

03:11.025 --> 03:12.818
for Rory's college.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.444
Yeah. But is he using

03:12.860 --> 03:14.444
your pen to write the check?

03:14.486 --> 03:16.071
Of course, not.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.823
Then I don't see how he's

03:16.113 --> 03:17.823
involved in your lives.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.158
He's involved in her life, but--

03:19.198 --> 03:21.118
Lorelai, will you relax?

03:19.198 --> 03:21.118
The lunch went fine.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.120
It was very pleasant,

03:21.160 --> 03:23.120
and Christopher enjoyed it.

03:23.162 --> 03:25.330
That's right.

03:23.162 --> 03:25.330
He apologized for everything.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.290
He knows that

03:25.372 --> 03:27.290
we're no longer angry with him

03:27.332 --> 03:28.416
and we are all friends again.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.127
Well, with friends like these..

03:30.169 --> 03:32.880
And after lunch, your mother

03:30.169 --> 03:32.880
and I began discussing

03:32.921 --> 03:34.339
what we were going to do

03:32.921 --> 03:34.339
with all the money

03:34.381 --> 03:36.175
that had been allotted

03:34.381 --> 03:36.175
for Rory's tuition.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.468
And we came up

03:36.216 --> 03:38.468
with a brilliant idea.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.095
Oh, yeah? What?

03:40.137 --> 03:42.723
We're going to add

03:40.137 --> 03:42.723
some funds from our foundation

03:42.764 --> 03:46.935
and donate the total amount

03:42.764 --> 03:46.935
to Yale university in your name.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.603
- What?

03:46.977 --> 03:48.603
- 'That's right.'

03:48.645 --> 03:51.190
And we'll make sure it goes for

03:48.645 --> 03:51.190
something really important.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.151
- Like a medical building.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.151
- For really handsome doctors.

03:54.193 --> 03:56.153
Whatever it is, I want

03:54.193 --> 03:56.153
her name big and prominent.

03:56.195 --> 03:57.696
My name?

03:57.738 --> 04:00.281
"The Rory Gilmore

03:57.738 --> 04:00.281
Political Science Building."

04:00.323 --> 04:02.367
"The Rory Gilmore

04:00.323 --> 04:02.367
Anthropology Building."

04:02.409 --> 04:03.702
Uh, guys?

04:03.744 --> 04:05.162
"The Rory Gilmore

04:03.744 --> 04:05.162
Cultural Center."

04:05.204 --> 04:07.081
"The Rory Gilmore Auditorium."

04:07.122 --> 04:08.456
Can I interject

04:07.122 --> 04:08.456
for just a second?

04:08.498 --> 04:09.833
Go ahead. I dare you.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.752
While I think it's

04:09.875 --> 04:11.752
very generous of both of you

04:11.793 --> 04:12.920
to wanna do this for me--

04:12.961 --> 04:15.089
"The Rory Gilmore Observatory."

04:15.130 --> 04:16.924
I still go to Yale,

04:15.130 --> 04:16.924
so having something

04:16.965 --> 04:18.633
with my name on it

04:16.965 --> 04:18.633
might be kind of--

04:18.675 --> 04:21.095
"The Rory Gilmore Center

04:18.675 --> 04:21.095
for International Affairs."

04:21.136 --> 04:23.931
Oh, wait.

04:21.136 --> 04:23.931
"The Rory Gilmore Library".

04:23.972 --> 04:25.724
- And art gallery.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.724
- And ancient-history museum.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.726
Forget it, kid. Grandma and

04:25.766 --> 04:27.726
grandpa have gone bye-bye.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.496
therapists on the list

05:29.537 --> 05:30.956
will do right, doctor?

05:29.537 --> 05:30.956
They're all at the same level?

05:30.998 --> 05:32.166
They're all top-notch.

05:32.207 --> 05:33.292
That's if I need

05:32.207 --> 05:33.292
a physical therapist.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.918
Hush, you.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.587
And you said lots of rest.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.587
But is complete bed rest safest?

05:37.629 --> 05:40.423
You cannot confine me to a bed.

05:37.629 --> 05:40.423
That's a violation of my rights.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.758
You need to monitor

05:40.465 --> 05:41.758
his progress.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.135
Everyone recovers

05:41.800 --> 05:43.135
at different speeds.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.719
And when you say,

05:43.177 --> 05:44.719
"plenty of fluids"

05:44.761 --> 05:47.388
does hot tea count, or just

05:44.761 --> 05:47.388
water? He likes hot tea.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.141
You gotta stop talking about me

05:47.430 --> 05:49.141
as if I'm not here.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.558
- Logan!

05:49.183 --> 05:50.558
- Mom!

05:50.600 --> 05:52.686
Tea is fine.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.686
Water and juice are better.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.271
And this wheelchair's

05:52.727 --> 05:54.271
absolutely necessary?

05:54.313 --> 05:56.731
- Hospital policy, sir.

05:54.313 --> 05:56.731
- Till you get out the building.

05:56.773 --> 05:59.318
- Can we at least go faster?

05:56.773 --> 05:59.318
- No, you'll get g-forces.

05:59.358 --> 06:00.652
Doctor, can I go home

05:59.358 --> 06:00.652
to your house?

06:00.694 --> 06:01.695
I think I'd have

06:00.694 --> 06:01.695
much more fun there.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.238
You're in good hands.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.405
Uh, just call if you have

06:03.280 --> 06:04.405
any more questions.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.491
I will. Thank you, Dr. Schultz.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.494
Okay, so, I cut off an old lady

06:06.533 --> 06:09.494
with a handicap sticker

06:09.536 --> 06:11.705
so we got a primo spot

06:09.536 --> 06:11.705
right out front.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.123
Colin is meeting us

06:11.746 --> 06:13.123
at the apartment

06:13.165 --> 06:15.000
to help me get you upstairs

06:13.165 --> 06:15.000
and in bed

06:15.042 --> 06:17.418
and it's a little cold outside,

06:15.042 --> 06:17.418
so you might need a scarf.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.920
I should have brought

06:17.460 --> 06:18.920
you a scarf.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.214
Maybe they have some

06:18.962 --> 06:20.214
in the gift shop. I'll go check.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.007
Actually, there's something

06:20.255 --> 06:22.007
going on here.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.801
What, your throat? Is it sore?

06:22.049 --> 06:24.801
Should I go get Dr. Schultz?

06:24.843 --> 06:28.055
I mean, we're here.

06:24.843 --> 06:28.055
We might as well..

06:28.096 --> 06:30.224
Thank you for being who I want

06:28.096 --> 06:30.224
to get out of the hospital for.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.309
- You're welcome.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.309
- And I'm not cold. I'm fine.

06:32.351 --> 06:33.768
- You promise?

06:32.351 --> 06:33.768
- I promise.

06:33.810 --> 06:34.936
Okay, let's go.

06:36.313 --> 06:37.814
We get to go at my speed.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.566
Wake me when we hit the door.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.736
This is a lawsuit!

06:42.777 --> 06:46.323
You do not fool with people's

06:42.777 --> 06:46.323
heads and bodies like this!

06:46.365 --> 06:48.033
No! You listen! You..

06:48.075 --> 06:49.159
Sookie, emergency.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.159
I'm crashing.

06:49.201 --> 06:50.827
Fresh pot over there.

06:50.869 --> 06:53.163
You know you wouldn't treat

06:50.869 --> 06:53.163
Nicole Kidman like this.

06:53.205 --> 06:54.706
(Michel)

06:53.205 --> 06:54.706
'Nicole Kidman.'

06:54.748 --> 06:55.957
Red hair, tall.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.251
Okay, then, Julia Roberts.

06:57.292 --> 06:59.711
You wouldn't treat

06:57.292 --> 06:59.711
Julia Roberts like this.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.504
Red hair, tall.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.464
Okay, then, Scarlett Johansson.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.464
What are you, a shut-in?

07:03.506 --> 07:05.092
- Why is he prancing?

07:03.506 --> 07:05.092
- Hmm?

07:05.133 --> 07:08.095
I will call my lawyer, and

07:05.133 --> 07:08.095
you'll hear from him when I do.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.512
Kiss my tush!

07:09.554 --> 07:10.805
Mmm! Damn it!

07:10.847 --> 07:12.974
You can trust nothing

07:10.847 --> 07:12.974
and no one ever!

07:13.016 --> 07:15.310
- Please stop that, Michel.

07:13.016 --> 07:15.310
- 'Oh, I cannot.'

07:15.352 --> 07:18.521
I cannot stop this

07:15.352 --> 07:18.521
for a very, very long time.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.815
I buy milk from

07:18.563 --> 07:20.815
the organic dairy down the way.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.984
The non-fat milk

07:20.857 --> 07:22.984
has a blue top. Blue!

07:23.026 --> 07:25.862
Today I find out

07:23.026 --> 07:25.862
that they have accidentally

07:25.904 --> 07:28.198
been putting red tops

07:25.904 --> 07:28.198
on the non-fat milk

07:28.240 --> 07:31.118
and blue on the 2%. 2%!

07:31.159 --> 07:33.828
For the last two weeks

07:31.159 --> 07:33.828
I have been drinking 2% milk

07:33.870 --> 07:36.164
in my coffee every single day.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.624
Insert gasp here.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.127
That's two full weeks

07:37.665 --> 07:40.127
of two cups of coffee a day.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.170
It used to be one cup,

07:40.168 --> 07:42.170
but then, suddenly

07:42.212 --> 07:46.258
the coffee started tasting so

07:42.212 --> 07:46.258
good, I added an afternoon jolt

07:46.300 --> 07:48.551
and now I find out

07:46.300 --> 07:48.551
I've been consuming

07:48.593 --> 07:50.429
an extra billion calories

07:48.593 --> 07:50.429
a week.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.306
At least it hasn't affected

07:50.470 --> 07:52.306
your ability to do math.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.141
Isn't this bouncing

07:52.347 --> 07:54.141
bothering you?

07:54.182 --> 07:56.893
It was, but now it's kind of

07:54.182 --> 07:56.893
like having a Beyonce video on.

07:56.935 --> 07:59.187
Now I have to burn off

07:56.935 --> 07:59.187
all these calories

07:59.229 --> 08:02.107
and I have to deal

07:59.229 --> 08:02.107
with 2%-fat-milk withdrawal.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.733
Michel, why didn't you

08:02.149 --> 08:03.733
just look on the bottle?

08:03.775 --> 08:06.278
Oho-o-o..

08:03.775 --> 08:06.278
You just know everything.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.404
(Michel)

08:06.320 --> 08:07.404
'Don't you you little

08:06.320 --> 08:07.404
Miss I-know-everything?'

08:07.446 --> 08:08.738
[cellphone ringing]

08:08.780 --> 08:09.781
- Hello?

08:08.780 --> 08:09.781
- Hey, gotcha.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.491
Yes, you did.

08:11.532 --> 08:13.160
(Luke)

08:11.532 --> 08:13.160
'We've been missing

08:11.532 --> 08:13.160
each other lately.'

08:13.201 --> 08:15.162
Oh, well, things are crazy.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.455
You know,

08:15.203 --> 08:16.455
we're totally booked up here

08:16.496 --> 08:17.789
and, um, Rory has her finals.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.416
You're helpin' Rory

08:17.831 --> 08:19.416
with her finals?

08:19.458 --> 08:22.419
'Moral support, late-night

08:19.458 --> 08:22.419
phone calls, that kinda thing.'

08:22.461 --> 08:25.172
And, of course, Michel got

08:22.461 --> 08:25.172
the wrong milk today, so..

08:25.213 --> 08:27.590
Oh, well, I didn't know

08:25.213 --> 08:27.590
about Michel's milk.

08:27.632 --> 08:30.677
Okay, so, uh,

08:27.632 --> 08:30.677
you headin' by the diner today?

08:30.718 --> 08:33.721
'No, can't. There's just

08:30.718 --> 08:33.721
too much to do here.'

08:33.763 --> 08:36.266
Okay, well,

08:33.763 --> 08:36.266
then, we'll hook up tonight.

08:36.308 --> 08:40.395
Ah, tonight's a staff meeting

08:36.308 --> 08:40.395
and attendance is mandatory.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.855
It would look pretty weird

08:40.437 --> 08:41.855
if the person

08:41.896 --> 08:43.523
who called the meeting

08:41.896 --> 08:43.523
didn't show.

08:43.564 --> 08:44.983
There's a staff meeting tonight?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.401
'Did you know about

08:45.025 --> 08:46.401
a staff meeting?'

08:46.443 --> 08:48.236
- No, I didn't.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.236
- I don't have a sitter tonight.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.571
I set up a three-hour session

08:48.278 --> 08:50.571
with my trainer tonight.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.657
I'll have to pay full price

08:50.613 --> 08:52.657
if I cancel this late.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.117
It's like $2 zillion dollars.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.660
Staff meeting? Huh?

08:54.159 --> 08:55.660
I didn't know you had

08:55.702 --> 08:57.162
a staff meeting tonight.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.162
Did it just come up?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.538
Pretty much.

08:58.579 --> 09:00.457
Well, I'm sorry

08:58.579 --> 09:00.457
I'm not gonna see you.

09:00.499 --> 09:01.958
'Yeah, me too.'

09:02.000 --> 09:04.336
- So, tomorrow?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.336
- 'Sure, maybe.'

09:04.378 --> 09:05.920
- 'We'll talk in the morning.'

09:04.378 --> 09:05.920
- Okay.

09:05.962 --> 09:11.009
- We'll talk in the morning.

09:05.962 --> 09:11.009
- Okay. Well...bye.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.552
I have to get a babysitter if

09:11.051 --> 09:12.552
there's gonna be

09:12.593 --> 09:14.637
a staff meeting tonight.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.637
And Becky, the good one

09:14.679 --> 09:16.723
is at her grandmother's

09:14.679 --> 09:16.723
so I'll have to use her

09:16.764 --> 09:18.641
crazy Goth sister

09:16.764 --> 09:18.641
who wears the snake

09:18.683 --> 09:20.768
around her neck

09:18.683 --> 09:20.768
and eats all my Eggos.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.229
There's no

09:20.810 --> 09:22.229
staff meeting tonight.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.481
[groaning]

09:22.270 --> 09:24.481
Thank God!

09:24.523 --> 09:25.815
If there's no

09:24.523 --> 09:25.815
staff meeting tonight

09:25.857 --> 09:27.734
why did you

09:25.857 --> 09:27.734
tell Luke there was?

09:27.775 --> 09:29.361
I don't wanna get into it.

09:29.403 --> 09:32.822
Sookie! Just the person

09:29.403 --> 09:32.822
I was hoping to see.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.574
Alone.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.701
Oh. So, we'll be right back.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.456
Jackson, wait. What is it?

09:41.498 --> 09:43.166
We need complete

09:41.498 --> 09:43.166
privacy for this.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.501
For what?

09:44.543 --> 09:46.002
- Smell me.

09:44.543 --> 09:46.002
- What?

09:46.044 --> 09:47.712
Smell me.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.712
What do I smell like?

09:47.754 --> 09:49.172
[sighing]

09:49.214 --> 09:51.341
You smell like Jackson

09:49.214 --> 09:51.341
and somethin' else.

09:51.383 --> 09:54.719
What is that? It's not zucchini.

09:51.383 --> 09:54.719
It's not sprouts.

09:54.761 --> 09:55.762
It's marijuana.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.389
[gasping]

09:55.803 --> 09:57.389
Yes! Oh, my God!

09:57.431 --> 09:59.266
Jackson, why do you smell

09:57.431 --> 09:59.266
like Marijuana?

09:59.307 --> 10:01.059
You know that back half-acre

09:59.307 --> 10:01.059
that I haven't planted for

10:01.101 --> 10:03.978
a few years, up on the slope,

10:01.101 --> 10:03.978
out of sight, out of mind?

10:04.020 --> 10:05.772
Well, I went back there

10:04.020 --> 10:05.772
this morning

10:05.813 --> 10:07.982
and it's a giant field of pot!

10:08.024 --> 10:10.693
Every square inch.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.693
Hundreds of plantings.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.446
It looks like

10:10.735 --> 10:12.446
Harrison Ford's backyard.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.114
- How did this happen?

10:12.487 --> 10:14.114
- The Templeton Brothers.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.698
Templeton Brothers.

10:15.740 --> 10:18.159
They must have planted it

10:15.740 --> 10:18.159
right before I fired 'em.

10:18.201 --> 10:19.702
I told them to

10:18.201 --> 10:19.702
weed the back half-acre.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.371
They're not the

10:19.744 --> 10:21.371
smartest of fellows.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.248
They were always listening

10:21.413 --> 10:23.248
to the "Allman Brothers".

10:23.290 --> 10:25.750
We should never hire guys that

10:23.290 --> 10:25.750
listen to the "Allman brothers".

10:25.792 --> 10:28.795
What are we gonna do? It's a

10:25.792 --> 10:28.795
full half-acre of marijuana!

10:28.836 --> 10:31.590
Shh! We can't

10:28.836 --> 10:31.590
keep saying the M word.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.716
- Someone will overhear.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.716
- Right, sorry.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.009
We need a code word.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.970
How about "evil crop"?

10:37.011 --> 10:38.763
Something more normal.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.224
- Hey, how 'bout "pickles"?

10:38.805 --> 10:41.224
- Good. We'll say, "pickles".

10:41.266 --> 10:43.643
Do you realize that at this

10:41.266 --> 10:43.643
moment we are both felons?

10:43.684 --> 10:45.395
Why? We didn't grow the stuff.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.230
The pickles!

10:45.437 --> 10:47.230
We didn't grow the pickles!

10:47.272 --> 10:49.065
But we're in possession.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.692
If the cops came to my field

10:49.107 --> 10:51.692
today, we'd go to jail.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.487
We'd lose everything we own.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.487
We'd lose the kids.

10:53.528 --> 10:54.904
All because of pickles.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.697
I'm gonna send my guys home

10:54.946 --> 10:56.697
right now.

10:56.739 --> 10:57.865
And I'm gonna

10:56.739 --> 10:57.865
single-handedly pull

10:57.907 --> 10:59.033
every last pickle out of there.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.660
Good. Yes, good and do it quick.

11:00.701 --> 11:01.702
- I'll try.

11:00.701 --> 11:01.702
- You're sweating.

11:01.744 --> 11:02.829
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

11:02.870 --> 11:03.871
It makes you look guilty.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.165
I'll try to stop.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.416
We've got to walk out

11:05.206 --> 11:06.416
of this room

11:06.458 --> 11:07.834
cool and calm.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.252
Just like it's any other day.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.630
Cool and calm. Got it.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.256

11:15.883 --> 11:17.427

- About what?

12:03.181 --> 12:04.723
Nice. What can I get you?

12:04.765 --> 12:06.476
First couple of days,

12:04.765 --> 12:06.476
it was itchin' like crazy

12:06.518 --> 12:08.019
but now I'm used to it.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.937
Although I find myself

12:08.061 --> 12:09.937
doing this a lot.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.565
What do you want to eat, Kirk?

12:11.606 --> 12:13.567
Last weekend, I accidentally

12:11.606 --> 12:13.567
wrote all over my face

12:13.608 --> 12:15.318
with a sharpie and Lulu

12:13.608 --> 12:15.318
thought it looked kind of sexy.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.070
That's where I got the idea.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.239
It looks really good, Kirk.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.239
Now, can I take your order?

12:19.280 --> 12:20.281
Hmm.

12:20.323 --> 12:21.991
I'll come back.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.743
- Big brother!

12:22.033 --> 12:24.743
- Hey, you're back, huh?

12:24.785 --> 12:26.287
- I'm back.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.287
- How was the fair?

12:26.329 --> 12:29.332
Oh, amazing.

12:26.329 --> 12:29.332
My jewelry's bigger than ever.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.459
I make it, it sells.

12:31.501 --> 12:32.877
I got all this money now

12:32.919 --> 12:35.380
but I got no idea what

12:32.919 --> 12:35.380
to do with it. Not a clue.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.965
- How 'bout puttin' in a bank?

12:35.422 --> 12:37.965
- There's a thought.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.009
Hey, let me tell you

12:38.007 --> 12:40.009
my big, exciting news!

12:40.051 --> 12:41.344
- Uh-oh.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.344
- It's not an uh-oh.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.429
It's good,

12:41.386 --> 12:42.429
unless you don't like babies

12:42.470 --> 12:44.097
in which case it's not so good.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.599
You're pregnant?!

12:45.640 --> 12:47.559
Oh, it was supposed to be

12:45.640 --> 12:47.559
a surprise. Who told you?

12:47.601 --> 12:50.144
- You just did.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.144
- Wow, I blew my own surprise.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.105
That's great, Liz.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.105
It's great, right?

12:52.146 --> 12:54.148
Amazing. I am over the moon.

12:54.190 --> 12:57.444
Well, sit, sit.

12:54.190 --> 12:57.444
You're in a delicate state.

12:57.485 --> 13:00.697
I am gonna take care of myself

12:57.485 --> 13:00.697
this time, big brother.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.449
I'm gonna do all the

13:00.739 --> 13:02.449
healthy things for me

13:02.490 --> 13:04.117
I did not do

13:02.490 --> 13:04.117
last time I was pregnant

13:04.158 --> 13:05.784
like, not binge drink.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.412
Good plan. So, so, where's TJ?

13:07.454 --> 13:08.871
I mean, he must be

13:07.454 --> 13:08.871
thrilled about this.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.540
- Ah, he's gone.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.540
- Gone?

13:10.582 --> 13:12.041
You mean gone outta town?

13:12.083 --> 13:14.168
He's gone.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.168
The big "gone outta my life".

13:14.210 --> 13:16.921
- Do you have Matzo Brie?

13:14.210 --> 13:16.921
- What? Liz, no.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.839
Okay. How 'bout

13:16.963 --> 13:18.839
a Denver Omelet?

13:18.881 --> 13:21.426
No. I mean, no. TJ can't

13:18.881 --> 13:21.426
be gone. He's your husband.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.970
Since when does that

13:21.468 --> 13:23.970
keep guys from leaving?

13:24.011 --> 13:26.097
- He's left you?

13:24.011 --> 13:26.097
- He's left.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.600
How can you be so calm

13:26.139 --> 13:28.600
about this? You're so calm.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.227
Because I got my new

13:28.642 --> 13:31.227
come-what-may philosophy.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.979
- Your what?

13:31.269 --> 13:32.979
- My philosophy.

13:33.020 --> 13:36.316
It's about accepting what comes

13:33.020 --> 13:36.316
your way, whatever it is.

13:36.357 --> 13:39.152
If a bus is heading

13:36.357 --> 13:39.152
right at you, let it come.

13:39.193 --> 13:42.238
If a piece of space junk

13:39.193 --> 13:42.238
comes hurtling down at you.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.991
- Let it come.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.991
- Or you step out of the way.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.201
You know, that's probably better

13:45.032 --> 13:47.201
and when I said what I said now

13:47.243 --> 13:48.662
it felt wrong.

13:48.703 --> 13:51.038
- Did he know you were pregnant?

13:48.703 --> 13:51.038
- I just told him.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.291
So he ran out

13:51.080 --> 13:53.291
on his wife and child?

13:53.333 --> 13:55.293
Luke, you're getting mad

13:53.333 --> 13:55.293
over nothing.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.461
It's not nothing.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.755
Well, I need you to stay calm

13:58.797 --> 14:04.010
because right now it's all about

13:58.797 --> 14:04.010
the baby, and it's all good.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.886
Really.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.180
Come what may.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.516
Alright, fine. Whatever.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.516
It's all good.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.185
Now, baby and I

14:09.557 --> 14:12.185
would like that omelet.

14:12.226 --> 14:13.436
Comin' up.

14:15.647 --> 14:19.400
- Metaphase. Anaphase..

14:15.647 --> 14:19.400
- Paris?

14:19.442 --> 14:21.569
- Male reproductive tract.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.569
- What?

14:21.611 --> 14:24.905
Seven up. Seminiferous tubules,

14:21.611 --> 14:24.905
epididymis, vas deferens

14:24.947 --> 14:28.117
ejaculatory duct,

14:24.947 --> 14:28.117
nothing, urethra, penis.

14:28.159 --> 14:30.453
- What are you doing?

14:28.159 --> 14:30.453
- Boning up. Pardon the pun.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.288
Got my MCATs coming up.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.288
Medical school.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.623
I meant,

14:32.330 --> 14:33.623
what are you doing here?

14:33.665 --> 14:35.291
- Looking after you.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.291
- Oh, goody.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.876
It's necessary.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.876
You seem like

14:36.917 --> 14:38.670
the kind of lunk-head

14:36.917 --> 14:38.670
that would get up too soon

14:38.712 --> 14:41.088
and inadvertently push a

14:38.712 --> 14:41.088
broken rib bone into his spleen.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.632
Well, hey, there, sleepy-head.

14:42.674 --> 14:45.385
- Oh, goody. A matching set.

14:42.674 --> 14:45.385
- You sleep well?

14:45.426 --> 14:47.220
- He's watching me, too?

14:45.426 --> 14:47.220
- Rory said it would be okay.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.429
Hey, now that you're awake,

14:47.261 --> 14:48.429
you mind if I switch

14:48.471 --> 14:50.056
the TV to the speakers?

14:50.097 --> 14:51.850
They're just about to reunite

14:50.097 --> 14:51.850
with their husbands

14:51.891 --> 14:53.309
and I'd love to get

14:51.891 --> 14:53.309
the full surround experience.

14:53.351 --> 14:54.602
- Who?

14:53.351 --> 14:54.602
- 'The Penguins.'

14:54.644 --> 14:56.354
You haven't seen

14:54.644 --> 14:56.354
the penguin movie?

14:56.396 --> 14:58.732
- The penguin movie rocks.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.732
- They'll move you, my friend.

14:58.773 --> 15:02.235
- So, is it okay? Great.

14:58.773 --> 15:02.235
- Hey,<i> mi casa es su casa.</i>

15:02.276 --> 15:03.944
Whoa, whoa, where do you think

15:02.276 --> 15:03.944
you're going, cowboy?

15:03.986 --> 15:05.530
- The nature calls.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.530
- You can't get up.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.698
Rory said you need

15:05.572 --> 15:06.698
complete bed rest.

15:06.740 --> 15:07.741
She trusted me

15:06.740 --> 15:07.741
with your well-being.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.492
I cannot betray that trust.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.578
Then what's your suggestion

15:09.534 --> 15:11.578
for my current predicament?

15:11.619 --> 15:13.204
I'll get the bedpan.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.204
Where's your bedpan?

15:13.246 --> 15:15.122
- I don't have a bedpan.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.122
- You got Tupperware?

15:15.164 --> 15:16.666
- Paris!

15:15.164 --> 15:16.666
- Doyle, watch him.

15:16.708 --> 15:17.834
Pausing.

15:17.876 --> 15:20.294
[sighing]

15:20.336 --> 15:23.631
[cellphone ringing]

15:23.673 --> 15:25.925
- Hey, why aren't you asleep?

15:23.673 --> 15:25.925
- 'Because I woke up.'

15:25.966 --> 15:28.010
- You're supposed to be asleep.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.010
- I've been asleep for a week.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.846
My body's bored of sleep.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.846
It wants to do something.

15:29.888 --> 15:31.806
Well, good thing your body

15:29.888 --> 15:31.806
has no say in the matter.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.099
Hey, boss, you're gonna

15:31.848 --> 15:33.099
want to see this.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.434
Uh, hold on a second.

15:34.475 --> 15:35.602
You've got to call off

15:34.475 --> 15:35.602
your sentries.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.186
They're there for a reason.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.230
To re-enact their favorite

15:37.228 --> 15:39.230
scenes from "Misery"?

15:39.272 --> 15:40.981
Your kitchen needs organizing!

15:41.023 --> 15:42.442
Yeah, I'll get right on that!

15:42.483 --> 15:44.026
You shouldn't talk loudly.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.026
You'll strain something.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.529
I've got Dina and Moshe

15:44.068 --> 15:46.529
Abramowitz on top of me.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.114
Why is Paris in the kitchen?

15:48.155 --> 15:49.824
Oh, she's looking for

15:48.155 --> 15:49.824
a bedpan substitute.

15:49.866 --> 15:51.576
- Oh, dear.

15:49.866 --> 15:51.576
- You really gotta see this.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.286
Just leave it, Bill.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.246
But I wanna see the look

15:53.327 --> 15:55.246
on your face when you read it.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.207
Provided you still have a face

15:55.288 --> 15:58.207
after your head explodes.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.251
Rory, look,

15:58.249 --> 16:00.251
I love your concern for me.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.044
I love that you're so invested

16:00.293 --> 16:02.044
in my well-being

16:02.086 --> 16:04.046
but even the doctor said that

16:02.086 --> 16:04.046
if I feel strong enough

16:04.088 --> 16:05.882
to move around, then I

16:04.088 --> 16:05.882
should do it. It's good for me.

16:05.924 --> 16:08.050
I don't know whether that doctor

16:05.924 --> 16:08.050
knows what he's talking about.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.553
You mean the Johns Hopkins

16:08.092 --> 16:10.553
graduate knows less than you?

16:10.595 --> 16:11.930
I'd kill to get

16:10.595 --> 16:11.930
into Johns Hopkins.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.014
Here. Patient's choice.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.058
- Oh, okay if I un-pause?

16:14.056 --> 16:16.058
- Un-pause.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.477
Here come the penguins.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.520
Look, maybe the doctor

16:17.518 --> 16:19.520
knows a little bit

16:19.562 --> 16:20.897
of what he's talking about.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.189
'You think?'

16:22.231 --> 16:24.233
So I guess get up,

16:22.231 --> 16:24.233
but super slow.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.485
It should look like a

16:24.275 --> 16:25.485
Monty Python routine

16:25.526 --> 16:26.527
you're moving so slow.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.154
I'll make John Cleese proud.

16:28.195 --> 16:30.156
And let Doyle help you,

16:28.195 --> 16:30.156
at least the first time.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.574
I'll let him help me

16:30.197 --> 16:31.574
to the bathroom door

16:31.616 --> 16:32.617
but I've gotta take it from

16:31.616 --> 16:32.617
there, Ace.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.327
Fine.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.496
I cannot look at the shot

16:34.368 --> 16:36.496
of the dead baby penguin.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.289
Me neither. Dead people, yes.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.289
Not penguins.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.457
You'll deal with Paris?

16:39.499 --> 16:40.750
- Put her on.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.750
- 'Thank you.'

16:40.792 --> 16:42.335
- Paris?

16:40.792 --> 16:42.335
- Can I look?

16:42.376 --> 16:44.253
- We're clear.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.253
- Please talk to Rory.

16:44.295 --> 16:45.964
What is so important about

16:44.295 --> 16:45.964
the "Wall Street Journal?"

16:46.005 --> 16:47.006
Oh, you'll see.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.591
- Hey.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.591
- 'Stand down.'

16:48.633 --> 16:50.301
Thank you for sitting with him

16:50.343 --> 16:52.261
but I think he needs a little

16:50.343 --> 16:52.261
less hovering right now.

16:52.303 --> 16:54.806
Warren Beatty junior

16:52.303 --> 16:54.806
smooth-talk you? No.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.808
Even the doctor said

16:54.848 --> 16:56.808
he should be moving around some.

16:56.850 --> 16:57.851
I think I've been

16:56.850 --> 16:57.851
a little over-protective.

16:57.892 --> 16:59.435
Your call.

16:59.477 --> 17:01.354
'Have Doyle lend him

16:59.477 --> 17:01.354
a shoulder right now, okay?'

17:01.395 --> 17:03.523
Fine. Doyle, give Logan

17:01.395 --> 17:03.523
your shoulder.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.191
You got it.

17:05.232 --> 17:08.068
- See you soonish?

17:05.232 --> 17:08.068
- 'Just finishing up here.'

17:08.110 --> 17:11.781
<i>Mi</i> shoulder<i> es su</i> shoulder.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.282
Hey, this is very

17:11.823 --> 17:13.282
life-affirming

17:13.324 --> 17:15.075
very penguin-esque.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.495
With the soundtrack music

17:15.117 --> 17:17.495
playing like that. Oh.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.414
- Hurry your soonish.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.414
- I will.

17:20.456 --> 17:21.624
What is it?

17:21.666 --> 17:23.835
I highlighted

17:21.666 --> 17:23.835
the appropriate section.

17:27.129 --> 17:30.925
Oh, it's going to be a quiet,

17:27.129 --> 17:30.925
slow-burning seethe.

17:30.967 --> 17:31.926
Disappointment.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.601
(Michel)

17:39.017 --> 17:40.601
'Right this way, you two.'

17:40.643 --> 17:43.479
Having beautiful

17:40.643 --> 17:43.479
weather today, no?

17:43.521 --> 17:48.067
Let's leave your bags here with

17:43.521 --> 17:48.067
the ever-trustworthy William

17:48.108 --> 17:51.738
and take a little tour

17:48.108 --> 17:51.738
of the inn.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.407
[chuckling]

17:51.779 --> 17:54.407
Okay, right this way.

17:54.448 --> 17:58.411
We have one of the finest

17:54.448 --> 17:58.411
restaurants in the area.

17:58.452 --> 17:59.829
[cellphone ringing]

17:59.871 --> 18:01.205
Hello?

18:01.247 --> 18:02.832
- 'How soon can you get here?'

18:01.247 --> 18:02.832
- What?

18:02.874 --> 18:04.375
How soon can you get here?

18:04.417 --> 18:06.419
- 'Mom, where are you?'

18:04.417 --> 18:06.419
- Home, of course.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.962
Where else would I be

18:06.460 --> 18:07.962
after what happened?

18:08.004 --> 18:09.255
- What happened?

18:09.296 --> 18:10.882
(Lorelai)

18:09.296 --> 18:10.882
'Yes, what happened?'

18:10.924 --> 18:13.551
The thing with my eye. What else

18:10.924 --> 18:13.551
would I be talking about?

18:13.593 --> 18:14.886
'You're talking about

18:13.593 --> 18:14.886
the laser?'

18:14.928 --> 18:16.012
The bad Lasik.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.388
The Lasik went bad?

18:17.430 --> 18:19.766
Your father called you.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.766
Tell me he called you.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.392
- Hold on a sec, mom.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.392
- 'Lorelai?'

18:21.434 --> 18:23.728
- Hello?

18:21.434 --> 18:23.728
- Lorelai, it's your father.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.813
I'm unconscionably late

18:23.770 --> 18:25.813
with this call.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.066
- Blame South Dakota.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.066
- Dad, what is going on here?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.567
Your mother's eye surgery

18:28.107 --> 18:29.567
went badly.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.360
She's alright,

18:29.609 --> 18:31.360
but she can't see a thing.

18:31.402 --> 18:32.904
Well, that doesn't sound

18:31.402 --> 18:32.904
alright to me.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.031
'It's only temporary.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.031
She's on painkillers.'

18:35.073 --> 18:37.283
'I would have been there myself,

18:35.073 --> 18:37.283
but I was called out of town.'

18:37.324 --> 18:38.952
Have you ever

18:37.324 --> 18:38.952
been to South Dakota?

18:38.993 --> 18:41.203
It's the most boring state

18:38.993 --> 18:41.203
in the nation.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.497
As I was flying in,

18:41.245 --> 18:43.497
I swear I saw

18:43.539 --> 18:45.792
one of the heads

18:43.539 --> 18:45.792
on Mount Rushmore yawn.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.627
She's asking

18:45.833 --> 18:47.627
how soon I can be there.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.045
Well, that's why I'm calling.

18:49.087 --> 18:50.504
I left her

18:49.087 --> 18:50.504
with a battery of help.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.172
But in case it didn't work out,

18:50.546 --> 18:52.172
she wanted me

18:52.214 --> 18:53.674
to give you a heads-up

18:52.214 --> 18:53.674
that she might need you.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.509
Well, I don't know

18:53.716 --> 18:55.509
if I can get away.

18:55.551 --> 18:58.679
It's her eyes, Lorelai. She

18:55.551 --> 18:58.679
can't do anything, go anywhere.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.473
I understand

18:58.721 --> 19:00.473
the importance of eyes, dad.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.183
I got caught up in meetings,

19:00.514 --> 19:03.183
or I would have called sooner.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.978
You wouldn't believe

19:03.225 --> 19:04.978
where I'm sitting right now.

19:05.019 --> 19:06.646
One of South Dakota's

19:05.019 --> 19:06.646
finest hotels.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.314
Smells like a foot.

19:08.355 --> 19:10.357
Let me get back to her, dad.

19:08.355 --> 19:10.357
She's on the other line.

19:10.399 --> 19:11.985
If you could cover for me,

19:10.399 --> 19:11.985
I'd appreciate it.

19:12.026 --> 19:13.235
If she found out

19:12.026 --> 19:13.235
I didn't call you

19:13.277 --> 19:14.821
it would make

19:13.277 --> 19:14.821
everything worse.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.656
- Okay. You got it.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.656
- 'Check in with me later.'

19:16.697 --> 19:18.282
Yeah...mom?

19:18.324 --> 19:20.409
Was that your father?

19:18.324 --> 19:20.409
Did he not call you?

19:20.451 --> 19:22.495
'No, dad called.

19:20.451 --> 19:22.495
I was just distracted before.'

19:22.536 --> 19:23.621
So, you need me to pop over?

19:23.663 --> 19:25.289
I'm all alone here

19:25.331 --> 19:26.749
and I desperately need

19:25.331 --> 19:26.749
to run a couple of errands.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.250
And there's no one else?

19:28.292 --> 19:30.544
I don't remember

19:28.292 --> 19:30.544
being in labor for 14 hours

19:30.586 --> 19:32.463
with anyone else,

19:30.586 --> 19:32.463
so, no, there's no one else.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.507
Okay. I'll be over.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.843
I'll be waiting.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.843
Blind and waiting.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.427
Okay, bye.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.853
I don't believe it!

19:46.894 --> 19:48.395
Who knew that clearing it

19:46.894 --> 19:48.395
would be the easy part?

19:48.437 --> 19:50.648
I had it all down

19:48.437 --> 19:50.648
in three hours, no problem.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.817
- I don't believe it!

19:50.690 --> 19:52.817
- What was I to do?

19:52.859 --> 19:55.277
If I put in the garbage,

19:52.859 --> 19:55.277
the garbage-man could see it.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.655
I know. And he

19:55.319 --> 19:57.655
looks like a big, fat fink.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.825
'If I put it down the garbage

19:57.697 --> 20:00.825
disposal, it could clog.'

20:00.867 --> 20:03.243
We'd have to call a plumber,

20:00.867 --> 20:03.243
and then he could fink on us.

20:03.285 --> 20:04.787
And he would, too.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.040
That guy seems like

20:04.829 --> 20:07.040
a big, fat, fatty fink.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.958
We can't flush it

20:07.081 --> 20:08.958
for the same reason

20:09.000 --> 20:11.085
and burning it seemed like

20:09.000 --> 20:11.085
a tremendously dumb idea.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.837
You'd get the whole town high.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.840
- So what was I to do?

20:12.879 --> 20:15.840
- Anything but bring it home!

20:15.882 --> 20:17.424
Then come up with your own idea.

20:17.466 --> 20:18.885
Well, I could

20:17.466 --> 20:18.885
bake it into brownies.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.053
Then what would we do

20:18.926 --> 20:20.053
with the brownies?

20:20.094 --> 20:21.345
I have no idea.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.472
I think that makes it

20:21.387 --> 20:23.472
a bad plan.

20:23.514 --> 20:25.599
Is it a better plan than the

20:23.514 --> 20:25.599
plan you couldn't even think of?

20:25.641 --> 20:27.226
At least it's a plan.

20:27.267 --> 20:28.519
Hey, we can't

20:27.267 --> 20:28.519
turn on each other here.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.562
We're all we've got.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.105
You're right. You're right.

20:31.147 --> 20:32.815
Hey, it's starting

20:31.147 --> 20:32.815
to smell up the place.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.608
We've just got to

20:32.857 --> 20:34.608
get it out of the house.

20:34.650 --> 20:37.195
Definitely out of the house.

20:34.650 --> 20:37.195
We'll get it out of the house.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.114
But we wait for dark.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.993
Wait for dark.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.036
I could kill him!

20:45.078 --> 20:46.704
You'd have to get in

20:45.078 --> 20:46.704
a very long line.

20:46.746 --> 20:47.955
The man should

20:46.746 --> 20:47.955
be drawn and quartered.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.289
There's no fast pass

20:47.997 --> 20:49.289
for the line, either.

20:49.331 --> 20:50.541
You just gotta

20:49.331 --> 20:50.541
get in there and wait.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.542
Quartering's too good for him.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.586
He should be

20:51.584 --> 20:53.586
eighth-ed, sixteenth-ed.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.004
I don't know. You quarter a guy.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.004
He's in four pieces.

20:55.046 --> 20:56.672
That's tough to recover from.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.966
He should be stretched on a

20:56.714 --> 20:58.966
rack, iron maiden strappado-ed.

20:59.008 --> 21:00.176
Oh, my god.

20:59.008 --> 21:00.176
What is strappado-ed?

21:00.218 --> 21:01.844
When you suspend him in the air

21:01.886 --> 21:04.263
with a rope tied to his hands

21:01.886 --> 21:04.263
that are tied behind his back.

21:04.304 --> 21:05.514
You're scaring me

21:04.304 --> 21:05.514
with your knowledge of torture.

21:05.556 --> 21:07.391
I did a paper

21:05.556 --> 21:07.391
on the attorney general.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.518
- It comes with the territory.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.518
- Life in modern America?

21:09.560 --> 21:11.604
Why would the Wall Street

21:09.560 --> 21:11.604
Journal print this? Why?

21:11.645 --> 21:13.106
It was an interview

21:11.645 --> 21:13.106
with my father.

21:13.147 --> 21:14.815
If he said it to them,

21:13.147 --> 21:14.815
they get to print it.

21:14.857 --> 21:17.151
- Even if it's a flat-out lie?

21:14.857 --> 21:17.151
- They don't know that.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.485
"I looked for the best

21:17.193 --> 21:18.485
and the brightest

21:18.527 --> 21:19.946
even at the intern level."

21:19.987 --> 21:21.447
Reading it again,

21:19.987 --> 21:21.447
you're just torturing yourself.

21:21.488 --> 21:23.323
"Ben Cochran at Harvard

21:23.365 --> 21:25.952
"he helped me out with my Boston

21:23.365 --> 21:25.952
paper, as did Frank Williams.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.494
"and Rory Gilmore

21:27.536 --> 21:30.039
"I gave her her first internship

21:27.536 --> 21:30.039

21:30.081 --> 21:32.833
of<i> the Yale Daily News."</i>

21:32.875 --> 21:34.376
It's classic Mitchum.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.670
How dare he? "I gave her

21:34.418 --> 21:36.670
her first internship"?

21:36.712 --> 21:38.338
This is one of

21:36.712 --> 21:38.338
dad's things, Rory.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.883
Grabbing credit wherever he can,

21:38.380 --> 21:40.883
whether it's earned or not.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.676
Everyone in America

21:40.925 --> 21:42.676
has read this.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.220
The Wall Street Journal's

21:42.718 --> 21:44.220
readership is high

21:44.262 --> 21:45.512
but it's not quite 300 million.

21:45.554 --> 21:46.722
Well, enough people

21:45.554 --> 21:46.722
have read it.

21:46.764 --> 21:48.515
Look. The beauty

21:46.764 --> 21:48.515
of a daily paper

21:48.557 --> 21:50.268
it's in everybody's

21:48.557 --> 21:50.268
recycling bin the next morning.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.393
This will totally be forgotten.

21:51.435 --> 21:52.812
- It won't.

21:51.435 --> 21:52.812
- It will.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.480
(Rory)

21:52.853 --> 21:54.480
'I remember everything I read.'

21:54.521 --> 21:56.398
front page, op-ed, concert

21:54.521 --> 21:56.398
reviews. It never leaves.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.485
My eyes accidentally flit

21:56.440 --> 21:59.485
over an obituary and I'm hunting

21:59.526 --> 22:02.029
and I can remember

21:59.526 --> 22:02.029
the deceased's first wife's name

22:02.071 --> 22:03.781
a full month afterward.

22:03.823 --> 22:06.117
I mean, and that's

22:03.823 --> 22:06.117
just a flit, not even a perusal.

22:06.159 --> 22:08.244
If I perused it,

22:06.159 --> 22:08.244
I could give you his grandkids

22:08.286 --> 22:10.037
in alphabetical order

22:08.286 --> 22:10.037
five years later.

22:10.079 --> 22:11.080
Ace, Ace, you drinking this in?

22:11.122 --> 22:12.456
What?

22:12.498 --> 22:14.125
Helen Keller

22:12.498 --> 22:14.125
just signed water, Annie.

22:14.167 --> 22:15.584
You walked!

22:15.626 --> 22:17.377
All by my lonesome.

22:15.626 --> 22:17.377
You proud of your boy?

22:17.419 --> 22:18.462
I'm very proud.

22:18.504 --> 22:19.630
Oh, and your color's

22:18.504 --> 22:19.630
coming back.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.132
You've gone

22:19.672 --> 22:21.132
from white to off-white.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.509
Hey, can we get to the bottom

22:21.174 --> 22:23.509
line on this article here?

22:23.550 --> 22:24.969
Give it to me.

22:25.011 --> 22:26.553
It's all good. It's very

22:25.011 --> 22:26.553
positive what he said to you.

22:26.595 --> 22:28.555
A powerful man is citing you

22:26.595 --> 22:28.555
as one of his accomplishments.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.432
- It's in no way a diss.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.432
- I know.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.434
It's actually a good thing,

22:30.474 --> 22:32.434
so you should let it go.

22:32.476 --> 22:33.435
Never!

22:37.898 --> 22:38.858
Hello?

22:43.821 --> 22:45.531
Mom?

22:45.572 --> 22:47.407
(Emily)

22:45.572 --> 22:47.407
'In here.'

22:47.449 --> 22:50.494
Oh, I'm sorry. Mrs. Onassis,

22:47.449 --> 22:50.494
I was looking for my mother.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.830
Will you at least promise

22:50.536 --> 22:52.830
to keep your comedy set

22:52.872 --> 22:55.124
at my funeral

22:52.872 --> 22:55.124
to under five minutes?

22:55.166 --> 22:56.709
Sorry, mom. How are you feeling?

22:56.750 --> 22:59.962
Horrible. That quack

22:56.750 --> 22:59.962
eye surgeon blinded me for life.

23:00.004 --> 23:01.463
Alright, I don't think

23:00.004 --> 23:01.463
he blinded you for life.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.217
Well, he blinded me

23:01.505 --> 23:04.217
for the next two days, at least.

23:04.258 --> 23:06.052
The procedure was a disaster.

23:06.093 --> 23:08.428
He did one eye and then

23:06.093 --> 23:08.428
announced that the new procedure

23:08.470 --> 23:10.306
didn't comport

23:08.470 --> 23:10.306
to the anatomy of my eye

23:10.348 --> 23:11.891
so he had to resort

23:10.348 --> 23:11.891
to the old procedure

23:11.932 --> 23:13.475
which I absolutely did not want.

23:13.517 --> 23:15.269
Because it's so last year.

23:15.311 --> 23:17.021
And, of course, he wouldn't

23:15.311 --> 23:17.021
go near the other eye

23:17.063 --> 23:18.314
until he saw

23:17.063 --> 23:18.314
how this one healed.

23:18.356 --> 23:19.690
Well, that makes sense.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.359
And then Dr. Mengele

23:19.732 --> 23:21.359
told me to rest

23:21.399 --> 23:23.401
and is having me

23:21.399 --> 23:23.401
put eyedrops in every hour

23:23.443 --> 23:25.279
further impeding my vision.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.948
And to top it off the man looked

23:25.321 --> 23:27.948
nothing like Marcus Welby.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.450
- Mom, where are all the people?

23:27.990 --> 23:30.450
- What people?

23:30.492 --> 23:33.204
Well, dad made it seem like you

23:30.492 --> 23:33.204
were surrounded by a small army

23:33.246 --> 23:34.663
you know,

23:33.246 --> 23:34.663
enough people to care for you

23:34.705 --> 23:36.414
then go topple Saddam's statue.

23:36.456 --> 23:38.167
- They're all gone.

23:36.456 --> 23:38.167
- Gone where?

23:38.209 --> 23:41.170
To hell, I hope. One person

23:38.209 --> 23:41.170
more incompetent than the rest.

23:41.212 --> 23:43.214
But all of them? The nurse?

23:43.256 --> 23:44.882
They'll do a "60 Minutes"

23:43.256 --> 23:44.882
on that woman one day.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.009
- Mark my words.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.009
- The housekeepers?

23:47.051 --> 23:48.302
Ate everything

23:47.051 --> 23:48.302
that wasn't nailed down.

23:48.344 --> 23:50.137
The errand boys?

23:50.179 --> 23:51.847
Their pants hung down

23:50.179 --> 23:51.847
below their underwear.

23:51.889 --> 23:54.558
And no one was worse

23:51.889 --> 23:54.558
than the driver he got me.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.851
Have you ever met

23:54.600 --> 23:55.851
the cab drivers in Prague?

23:55.893 --> 23:57.477
Uh, no.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.021
Well, they would hide

23:57.519 --> 23:59.021
their wallets from this man.

23:59.063 --> 24:00.940
Plus I think he had

23:59.063 --> 24:00.940
a gun in his pocket.

24:00.981 --> 24:02.900
Maybe he was

24:00.981 --> 24:02.900
just happy to see you.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.819
Lorelai, up.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.572
It doesn't matter anyhow.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.572
I'm fine getting my own food

24:08.614 --> 24:10.866
and I don't need people

24:08.614 --> 24:10.866
underfoot. I called the agency

24:10.908 --> 24:12.910
and a new maid will be here

24:10.908 --> 24:12.910
tomorrow morning.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.828
but I need to run

24:12.952 --> 24:14.828
some errands today

24:14.870 --> 24:16.663
and, obviously, I can't drive.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.663
You'll have to do that.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.498
- Do what?

24:16.705 --> 24:18.498
- Drive me.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.167
Oh, no. Mom, why don't you just

24:18.540 --> 24:20.167
give me the list of errands

24:20.209 --> 24:21.794
and I'll do them for you?

24:21.835 --> 24:23.212
No. It would take too

24:21.835 --> 24:23.212
much explanation.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.256
- Grab my bag, please.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.256
- Mom, seriously.

24:25.298 --> 24:26.548
What kind of errands are they?

24:26.590 --> 24:28.550
Shopping, banking,

24:26.590 --> 24:28.550
hardware store?

24:28.592 --> 24:30.844
I need to get my coat first.

24:30.886 --> 24:33.597
Mom, is it dealing

24:30.886 --> 24:33.597
in human trafficking?

24:33.639 --> 24:35.891
'Cause I'm

24:33.639 --> 24:35.891
an excellent people person.

24:40.313 --> 24:42.315
Mom, mom, you've got to look up.

24:42.356 --> 24:44.817
I can't look up.

24:42.356 --> 24:44.817
The sun causes searing pain.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.819
Mom, the sun can't

24:44.858 --> 24:46.819
even find you under that hat.

24:46.860 --> 24:48.404
If we put that hat

24:46.860 --> 24:48.404
on Frosty the Snowman

24:48.446 --> 24:50.030
he'd be living

24:48.446 --> 24:50.030
in Miami right now.

24:50.072 --> 24:52.074
You're a very insensitive

24:50.072 --> 24:52.074
person, you know that?

24:52.116 --> 24:53.742
Yes, I do. Here we go.

24:53.784 --> 24:55.619
- What is this?

24:53.784 --> 24:55.619
- This is my car.

24:55.661 --> 24:57.330
We can't go in this.

24:55.661 --> 24:57.330
We have to take the other car.

24:57.371 --> 24:58.956
What other car?

24:57.371 --> 24:58.956
No. Mom, that's not a car.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.624
That's a rap-video set.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.710
I ordered it specially. It has

25:00.666 --> 25:03.710
the darkest windows available.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.213
They say it's the car

25:03.752 --> 25:06.213
Jay-Z uses when he's in town.

25:06.255 --> 25:08.382
I assume that's

25:06.255 --> 25:08.382
an entertainer of some sort.

25:08.424 --> 25:09.842
The windows are bulletproof.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.844
They kept saying that

25:09.883 --> 25:11.844
as if it's a selling point.

25:11.885 --> 25:14.347
I told them I was not paying

25:11.885 --> 25:14.347
extra for bulletproof windows.

25:14.388 --> 25:16.056
I haven't been strafed in years.

25:16.098 --> 25:18.600
Mom, I don't understand. What do

25:16.098 --> 25:18.600
you mean, we'll take this car?

25:18.642 --> 25:20.186
- I thought the driver left.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.186
- He did.

25:20.227 --> 25:22.271
- Is there another one coming?

25:20.227 --> 25:22.271
- No.

25:22.313 --> 25:23.856
- Well, who's gonna drive?

25:22.313 --> 25:23.856
- You are.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.441
- I can't drive that.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.441
- Why not?

25:25.483 --> 25:27.026
Because, look at it.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.902
'I'm sure you need

25:27.067 --> 25:28.902
a special license or something.'

25:28.944 --> 25:30.321
Lorelai, I cannot ride

25:28.944 --> 25:30.321
in your jeep.

25:30.363 --> 25:32.448
It's completely

25:30.363 --> 25:32.448
exposed to the elements.

25:32.490 --> 25:35.075
You do remember I'm recovering

25:32.490 --> 25:35.075
from surgery, don't you?

25:35.117 --> 25:37.286
No, really. I thought you were

25:35.117 --> 25:37.286
just doing your best Mia Farrow

25:37.328 --> 25:39.079
in "Broadway Danny Rose"

25:37.328 --> 25:39.079
impersonation.

25:39.121 --> 25:40.747
Lorelai, I need

25:39.121 --> 25:40.747
my prescriptions.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.250
If I don't get my prescriptions,

25:40.789 --> 25:43.250
infection will set in

25:43.292 --> 25:45.211
and I will

25:43.292 --> 25:45.211
lose my eyesight completely

25:45.252 --> 25:47.463
and you will be doing this

25:45.252 --> 25:47.463
more than just today.

25:47.505 --> 25:48.464
Now, what's it going to be?

25:50.924 --> 25:53.344
Ridiculous Sarah Bernhardt

25:50.924 --> 25:53.344
overdramatic--

25:53.386 --> 25:55.346
My hearing's just fine, Lorelai.

25:55.388 --> 25:56.347
Sorry.

Hey, Luke,

You know why I'm here.

Okay.

26:32.966 --> 26:34.760
- Damn.

26:32.966 --> 26:34.760
- What?

26:34.801 --> 26:37.346
I just wish I was drinking

26:34.801 --> 26:37.346
faster. If I was more drunk

26:37.388 --> 26:38.847
gettin' punched out

26:37.388 --> 26:38.847
wouldn't hurt so much.

26:38.889 --> 26:40.891
- Just shut up, let's do this.

26:38.889 --> 26:40.891
- Go ahead.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.435
- Well, get ready.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.435
- Am ready.

26:42.476 --> 26:43.769
Well, raise your arms

26:42.476 --> 26:43.769
or something.

26:43.810 --> 26:44.811
I'm not gonna

26:43.810 --> 26:44.811
punch you like this.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.230
I thought that's why you came.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.356
- I came to fight.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.356
- Let's do it.

26:47.398 --> 26:48.399
Then raise your arms!

26:48.441 --> 26:50.067
- No!

26:48.441 --> 26:50.067
- TJ!

26:50.109 --> 26:52.903
I'm not hitting you, Luke.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.903
I got nothin' against you.

26:52.945 --> 26:56.156
Plus there's no fightin' inside.

26:52.945 --> 26:56.156
It's Lanny's top rule

26:56.198 --> 26:57.741
along with no

26:56.198 --> 26:57.741
burnin' down the place.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.076
That actually comes first.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.618
Well, then,

26:59.118 --> 27:00.618
let's take it outside.

27:00.660 --> 27:02.455
Let me ask you one question

27:00.660 --> 27:02.455
really quick

27:02.496 --> 27:04.415
and then you can

27:02.496 --> 27:04.415
ake me outside and clobber me.

27:04.457 --> 27:05.583
Okay, what?

27:05.623 --> 27:07.625
What the hell is this about?

27:07.667 --> 27:10.379
You're unbelievable!

27:07.667 --> 27:10.379
It's about Liz!

27:10.421 --> 27:12.548
What about her? Is she alright?

27:12.590 --> 27:13.924
Alright? You walked out on her!

27:13.966 --> 27:15.509
- No, I didn't.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.509
- Yeah, you did.

27:15.551 --> 27:17.386
That's why you're here

27:15.551 --> 27:17.386
drinking in the afternoon.

27:17.428 --> 27:18.804
That's not

27:17.428 --> 27:18.804
why I'm here drinkin'.

27:18.845 --> 27:20.347
I'm drinkin' because I'm upset.

27:20.389 --> 27:23.559
You're upset?

27:20.389 --> 27:23.559
You abandoned Liz and your baby!

27:23.601 --> 27:26.270
Hey, I would never do that.

27:23.601 --> 27:26.270
I love your sister, Luke.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.855
- She threw me out.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.855
- That's not what she said.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.648
We came home from the fair.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.648
It was great.

27:30.690 --> 27:32.568
We were both happy.

27:30.690 --> 27:32.568
We made money.

27:32.610 --> 27:34.820
Then Liz goes to the doctor

27:32.610 --> 27:34.820
and she comes home

27:34.861 --> 27:37.156
and tells me she's pregnant.

27:34.861 --> 27:37.156
I hug her. I kiss her.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.740
I'm cryin'. I'm so happy.

27:38.782 --> 27:40.451
Then I turn to grab

27:38.782 --> 27:40.451
the phone to tell the family

27:40.493 --> 27:42.369
and an ashtray hits me

27:40.493 --> 27:42.369
in the back of the head.

27:42.411 --> 27:43.912
Then a phone book and a stapler

27:43.954 --> 27:45.747
and our statue of a happy clown

27:43.954 --> 27:45.747
playing the saxophone.

27:45.789 --> 27:47.207
I'm not gettin' this.

27:47.249 --> 27:49.001
She's yellin' at me saying

27:47.249 --> 27:49.001
things like

27:49.042 --> 27:50.544
"This ain't gonna work.

27:50.586 --> 27:53.297
You're gonna mess this kid up.

27:50.586 --> 27:53.297
You can't raise a kid."

27:53.339 --> 27:55.424
She's saying, "this kid will

27:53.339 --> 27:55.424
grow up with no discipline.

27:55.466 --> 27:56.883
"it'll get out of control.

27:56.925 --> 27:58.636
Then we'll end up

27:56.925 --> 27:58.636
havin' to send it away."

27:58.676 --> 28:01.221
I tell her she's wrong. I tell

27:58.676 --> 28:01.221
her I'll do whatever's needed.

28:01.263 --> 28:03.098
I'll read every book

28:01.263 --> 28:03.098
on the subject

28:03.140 --> 28:06.059
even though I hate reading worse

28:03.140 --> 28:06.059
than I hate public television.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.187
But Liz won't hear it.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.187
She tells me to go.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.939
- She told you to go?

28:08.228 --> 28:10.939
- So I packed a bag and left.

28:10.981 --> 28:14.401
I didn't want to, but Liz is

28:10.981 --> 28:14.401
always right about everything

28:14.443 --> 28:17.655
and if my stayin' around is

28:14.443 --> 28:17.655
gonna screw up the kid like that

28:17.695 --> 28:19.072
I'm gone, no questions asked.

28:19.114 --> 28:21.534
Oh, jeez, Liz.

28:21.575 --> 28:23.452
- What?

28:21.575 --> 28:23.452
- Have a seat, TJ.

28:23.494 --> 28:25.287
Give me a beer.

28:25.329 --> 28:28.165
Listen, TJ..

28:28.207 --> 28:30.417
Liz wasn't talkin' to you when

28:28.207 --> 28:30.417
she was saying all that stuff.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.336
She was talkin' to herself.

28:32.378 --> 28:35.214
I'm pretty sure she was talkin'

28:32.378 --> 28:35.214
to me. She kept sayin' my name.

28:35.255 --> 28:37.424
No. When she said

28:35.255 --> 28:37.424
you were gonna mess up the baby

28:37.466 --> 28:38.884
she was sayin' somethin' else.

28:38.925 --> 28:40.678
Just take out the "you"

28:38.925 --> 28:40.678
make it an "I".

28:40.719 --> 28:42.429
She meant you're

28:40.719 --> 28:42.429
gonna screw up the baby?

28:42.471 --> 28:43.639
No, she meant she was.

28:43.681 --> 28:45.349
- And I was.

28:43.681 --> 28:45.349
- No, just her.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.643
Then why didn't she throw

28:45.391 --> 28:47.643
the ashtray at herself?

28:47.685 --> 28:49.687
Because she was

28:47.685 --> 28:49.687
takin' it out on you.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.147
- Oh. This is complicated.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.147
- That's because people are.

28:52.189 --> 28:53.899
Sometimes they just

28:52.189 --> 28:53.899
don't say what they mean.

28:53.940 --> 28:56.109
Yeah. I hate that.

28:53.940 --> 28:56.109
It's hard enough followin' them

28:56.151 --> 28:57.861
when they're talkin' about

28:56.151 --> 28:57.861
what they're talkin' about.

28:57.903 --> 29:00.864
Yeah. That's the trick

28:57.903 --> 29:00.864
with relationships, believe me.

29:00.906 --> 29:05.785
Look, you have to try to tune in

29:00.906 --> 29:05.785
to what your partner means

29:05.827 --> 29:07.913
as opposed to what

29:05.827 --> 29:07.913
she's actually sayin'.

29:07.954 --> 29:11.500
They sometimes won't tell you

29:07.954 --> 29:11.500
how they're feeling.

29:11.542 --> 29:14.211
But your job is to try to

29:11.542 --> 29:14.211
figure out what she's sayin'

29:14.253 --> 29:16.505
from what she actually says.

29:16.547 --> 29:18.424
- Wow.

29:16.547 --> 29:18.424
- Yeah.

29:18.465 --> 29:21.218
I got none of that.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.597
It's okay.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.597
It's all gonna be okay.

29:24.638 --> 29:25.972
I'm gonna make this okay.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.435
[horn honking]

29:30.810 --> 29:33.355
- Ah, sorry.

29:30.810 --> 29:33.355
- Lorelai, be careful.

29:33.397 --> 29:36.275
What? I'm not used to driving

29:33.397 --> 29:36.275
a missile silo down the street.

29:36.316 --> 29:38.694
Oh, stop being

29:36.316 --> 29:38.694
so dramatic.

29:38.736 --> 29:42.114
Yeah, wouldn't

29:38.736 --> 29:42.114
wanna be dramatic.

29:42.155 --> 29:44.700
Alright, get over here.

29:42.155 --> 29:44.700
You're going to turn right.

29:44.742 --> 29:45.784
[horn honking]

29:45.825 --> 29:47.911
- Aah! Sorry!

29:45.825 --> 29:47.911
- Lorelai!

29:47.953 --> 29:50.122
Well, i-it's

29:47.953 --> 29:50.122
a big freakin' car, mom.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.082
You're gonna

29:50.163 --> 29:52.082
give me a heart attack.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.376
Mom, please, how-how long

29:52.124 --> 29:54.376
is this gonna go on?

29:54.418 --> 29:55.794
You won't tell me

29:54.418 --> 29:55.794
where we're going.

29:55.835 --> 29:57.504
You give me

29:55.835 --> 29:57.504
block-by-block instructions.

29:57.546 --> 29:58.880
My goodness, Lorelai

29:58.922 --> 29:59.923
you've been complaining

29:58.922 --> 29:59.923
since we got started.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.341
No, I haven't.

30:01.383 --> 30:02.842
When we had to go to

30:01.383 --> 30:02.842
three different drugstores?

30:02.884 --> 30:05.095
- Well, come on.

30:02.884 --> 30:05.095
- I don't trust generic.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.388
Mom, it's the same thing.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.056
If I'm willing

30:06.430 --> 30:08.056
to pay full price

30:08.098 --> 30:10.726
then I deserve to have my drug

30:08.098 --> 30:10.726
bottle say "Valium" on it.

30:10.768 --> 30:13.437
- Fine.

30:10.768 --> 30:13.437
- I don't see why that's insane.

30:13.479 --> 30:14.438
Fine.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.150
So, have you talked

30:16.732 --> 30:18.150
to Christopher lately?

30:18.191 --> 30:20.402
Uh, no, not lately lately.

30:20.444 --> 30:22.488
- I have.

30:20.444 --> 30:22.488
- Well, bully for you.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.364
[inhales air deeply]

30:22.529 --> 30:24.364
You know, your father and I

30:24.406 --> 30:26.492
enjoyed our little sit-down

30:24.406 --> 30:26.492
with him very much.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.410
Oh, I'm glad.

30:28.452 --> 30:30.870
'You know, I'd forgotten what

30:28.452 --> 30:30.870
a handsome man Christopher is.'

30:30.912 --> 30:33.415
'He was wearing

30:30.912 --> 30:33.415
a very nice blue tie.'

30:33.457 --> 30:35.083
And his hair is very short.

30:35.125 --> 30:37.586
Normally, I don't like

30:35.125 --> 30:37.586
a man's hair that short.

30:37.628 --> 30:40.005
It makes him look

30:37.628 --> 30:40.005
like a convict or a masseuse

30:40.046 --> 30:41.340
but I think

30:40.046 --> 30:41.340
it works on him.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.175
Yeah, I'm sure it does.

30:43.216 --> 30:44.551
'He seemed lonely, though.'

30:44.593 --> 30:45.803
What?

30:45.844 --> 30:47.137
He's not dating anyone.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.137
I asked.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.930
- Well, he's got Gigi.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.930
- Who's Gigi?

30:48.972 --> 30:50.390
His daughter, mom.

30:50.432 --> 30:52.601
'Uh, well, we didn't

30:50.432 --> 30:52.601
discuss that.'

30:52.643 --> 30:54.936
'But I could tell

30:52.643 --> 30:54.936
he was lonely.'

30:54.978 --> 30:56.605
I'm sure he's fine.

30:56.647 --> 30:57.981
You know, I've been racking

30:56.647 --> 30:57.981
my brain trying to think

30:58.023 --> 30:59.566
of a nice girl

30:58.023 --> 30:59.566
to set him up with.

30:59.608 --> 31:00.818
Cezanne Moriarty

30:59.608 --> 31:00.818
just got divorced

31:00.859 --> 31:02.235
and she looks<i> wonderful.</i>

31:02.277 --> 31:03.945
She'd go perfectly

31:02.277 --> 31:03.945
with his hair and tie.

31:03.987 --> 31:06.406
Cezanne Moriarty is ten years

31:03.987 --> 31:06.406
older than Christopher.

31:06.448 --> 31:08.200
Lorelai, you were in

31:06.448 --> 31:08.200
the same class together.

31:08.241 --> 31:09.493
I know. It's 'cause

31:08.241 --> 31:09.493
she was stupid.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.077
We used to call her

31:09.535 --> 31:11.077
"Moroniarty".

31:11.119 --> 31:13.079
Well, Loretta Singer's husband

31:11.119 --> 31:13.079
just died.

31:13.121 --> 31:14.540
She'll be back

31:13.121 --> 31:14.540
from Bali soon.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.416
- She's got a horse face.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.416
- Not anymore.

31:16.458 --> 31:17.626
She's not his type, mom.

31:17.668 --> 31:19.127
What about Brandi Covington?

31:19.169 --> 31:21.880
She's a lovely girl

31:19.169 --> 31:21.880
with a wonderful sense of humor.

31:21.921 --> 31:23.923
- "Wonderful sense of humor"?

31:21.921 --> 31:23.923
- 'Yes.'

31:23.965 --> 31:26.719
- What joke did she ever told?

31:23.965 --> 31:26.719
- Well, I don't know.

31:26.760 --> 31:27.969
Well, you said she has a

31:26.760 --> 31:27.969
wonderful sense of humor.

31:28.011 --> 31:29.012
Tell me one of her jokes.

31:29.054 --> 31:30.263
'I don't know any.'

31:30.305 --> 31:31.765
An amusing anecdote

31:30.305 --> 31:31.765
she's told?

31:31.807 --> 31:33.099
I don't know, Lorelai.

31:33.141 --> 31:34.852
- A giggle-inducing pun.

31:33.141 --> 31:34.852
- Lorelai.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.645
Dirty limericks,

31:34.893 --> 31:36.645
song parody.

31:36.687 --> 31:38.480
Well, she has

31:36.687 --> 31:38.480

32:51.845 --> 32:53.889
Well, I am, actually, but

32:51.845 --> 32:53.889
it's the impression he left

that he gave me my start.

He did<i> not</i> give me my start.

33:00.061 --> 33:01.688
- That's dumb.

- Doesn't hurt to ask.

37:07.266 --> 37:08.560
I'm okay.

37:08.601 --> 37:10.311
I've had the headache

37:08.601 --> 37:10.311
for 38 years.

37:10.353 --> 37:12.064
We are anxious

37:10.353 --> 37:12.064
to see those pictures.

37:12.105 --> 37:13.106
What pictures?

37:13.148 --> 37:14.649
Alright.

37:13.148 --> 37:14.649
Well, follow me.

37:14.691 --> 37:16.526
I have the whole presentation

37:14.691 --> 37:16.526
ready for you.

37:16.568 --> 37:17.694
What presentation?

37:17.736 --> 37:19.112
Lorene, how are your twins?

37:19.154 --> 37:21.031
They are going to be

37:19.154 --> 37:21.031
seniors next fall.

37:21.073 --> 37:22.615
They grow up so fast,

37:21.073 --> 37:22.615
don't they?

37:22.657 --> 37:24.701
Like weeds. What presentation

37:22.657 --> 37:24.701
are we looking at?

37:24.743 --> 37:26.203
(Lorene)

37:24.743 --> 37:26.203
Here we are.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.413
So I talked to the owner

37:28.454 --> 37:30.832
and he said that they

37:28.454 --> 37:30.832
would be willing to throw in

37:30.874 --> 37:32.751
any of the furniture

37:30.874 --> 37:32.751
or appliances

37:32.792 --> 37:35.212
that we might like

37:32.792 --> 37:35.212
completely up to you.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.380
- Well, that's wonderful.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.380
- Why is that wonderful?

37:37.422 --> 37:39.549
Why is throwing in furniture and

37:37.422 --> 37:39.549
appliances wonderful, mom?

37:39.591 --> 37:40.967
Go on, Lorene.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.427
Anyhow, the pictures

37:41.009 --> 37:42.427
are pretty complete

37:42.468 --> 37:44.804
but I can get us in

37:42.468 --> 37:44.804
this weekend

37:44.846 --> 37:46.681
if you would like to take

37:44.846 --> 37:46.681
a closer look yourself.

37:46.723 --> 37:48.600
Do you, mom? Do you want

37:46.723 --> 37:48.600
to take a closer look?

37:48.641 --> 37:50.393
(Lorene)

37:48.641 --> 37:50.393
'This is only the second time'

37:50.435 --> 37:53.105
'that this house has been

37:50.435 --> 37:53.105
on the market in a 100 years.'

37:53.146 --> 37:55.440
[exhales deeply]

37:53.146 --> 37:55.440
It's got five bedrooms,

37:53.146 --> 37:55.440
four and a half baths

37:55.481 --> 37:57.609
with a library, a sun porch.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.194
It's on three acres

37:57.650 --> 37:59.194
with a very small

37:59.236 --> 38:00.904
what they call a fishing hole

38:00.946 --> 38:04.032
which is really a little pond,

38:00.946 --> 38:04.032
but it's very charming

38:04.074 --> 38:05.533
and it has stables for horses.

38:05.575 --> 38:07.285
I thought so.

38:07.326 --> 38:09.662
The roof is in good shape but

38:07.326 --> 38:09.662
I think that the plumbing

38:09.704 --> 38:11.206
will need some updating.

38:11.248 --> 38:13.166
But the sellers are motivated

38:13.208 --> 38:15.710
and I think it's

38:13.208 --> 38:15.710
a pretty special property.

38:15.752 --> 38:18.504
I do, too.

38:15.752 --> 38:18.504
Don't you?

38:18.546 --> 38:20.799
'Lorelai? Are you breathing?'

38:20.840 --> 38:23.135
Why are you looking

38:20.840 --> 38:23.135
at this house, mom?

38:23.176 --> 38:24.886
- Would you give us a minute?

38:23.176 --> 38:24.886
- Of course.

38:24.928 --> 38:26.846
I'll be right over here

38:24.928 --> 38:26.846
if you need me.

38:28.140 --> 38:29.599
Well, what do you think?

38:29.641 --> 38:33.103
Mom, please, tell me

38:29.641 --> 38:33.103
what is going on?

38:33.145 --> 38:36.106
I will tell you what's going on

38:33.145 --> 38:36.106
as soon as you tell me honestly

38:36.148 --> 38:37.398
what you think of this house.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.609
- I think it's fine.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.609
- "Fine"?

38:39.651 --> 38:41.736
Mom, it doesn't look like

38:39.651 --> 38:41.736
your type of house at all.

38:41.778 --> 38:44.030
I did not ask if you thought

38:41.778 --> 38:44.030
it was my type of house.

38:44.072 --> 38:45.490
I asked what<i> you</i> thought

38:44.072 --> 38:45.490
of the house.

38:45.531 --> 38:48.868
Well, I think

38:45.531 --> 38:48.868
it's a beautiful house.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.120
So do I.

38:50.162 --> 38:51.955
You already have

38:50.162 --> 38:51.955
a beautiful house, mom.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.749
Oh, I know. This house

38:51.997 --> 38:54.749
is not for me. It's for you.

38:54.791 --> 38:56.251
- Me?

38:54.791 --> 38:56.251
- You and Luke.

38:56.293 --> 38:57.836
'Now, before you get

38:56.293 --> 38:57.836
your nose out of joint'

38:57.877 --> 39:00.630
'and accuse me of interfering,

38:57.877 --> 39:00.630
hear me out.'

39:00.672 --> 39:02.340
I think your house

39:00.672 --> 39:02.340
is very nice.

39:02.381 --> 39:04.843
I know you've put

39:02.381 --> 39:04.843
a lot of work into it.

39:04.884 --> 39:07.137
But, Lorelai, it's too small

39:04.884 --> 39:07.137
for the two of you

39:07.179 --> 39:08.680
especially

39:07.179 --> 39:08.680
when you have children..

39:08.721 --> 39:10.389
<i>If</i> you have children,

39:08.721 --> 39:10.389
I mean.

39:10.431 --> 39:13.018
A man needs

39:10.431 --> 39:13.018
his own space and room

39:13.059 --> 39:15.228
and Luke does not

39:13.059 --> 39:15.228
have that at your house.

39:15.270 --> 39:17.272
Also, I know

39:15.270 --> 39:17.272
you've always wanted horses

39:17.314 --> 39:18.606
so I thought something

39:17.314 --> 39:18.606
with a little bit

39:18.648 --> 39:20.608
of property might be nice.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.986
'Now, I know it's not actually

39:20.650 --> 39:22.986
in Stars Hollow'

39:23.028 --> 39:25.113
'but it's right on the border.'

39:25.155 --> 39:27.073
It's only an extra

39:25.155 --> 39:27.073
ten minutes to the inn

39:27.115 --> 39:29.659
and an extra five minutes

39:27.115 --> 39:29.659
to the diner.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.828
Plus I did

39:29.701 --> 39:31.828
a little nosing around

39:31.870 --> 39:33.746
and I heard

39:31.870 --> 39:33.746
that if you grease the palm

39:33.788 --> 39:35.665
of the Stars Hollow

39:33.788 --> 39:35.665
zoning commissioner

39:35.707 --> 39:38.710
'a man named Taylor Doose'

39:38.751 --> 39:40.628
'you can get him

39:38.751 --> 39:40.628
to change property lines'

39:40.670 --> 39:42.672
so we can give you

39:40.670 --> 39:42.672
a Stars Hollow address

39:42.714 --> 39:45.050
if it's really important to you.

39:45.091 --> 39:46.509
You want to buy us a house?

39:48.220 --> 39:50.680
Well, I know you're not going to

39:48.220 --> 39:50.680
let me give you a wedding

39:50.722 --> 39:52.765
'so I thought

39:50.722 --> 39:52.765
a house would do.'

39:52.807 --> 39:54.726
All that running around

39:52.807 --> 39:54.726
Stars Hollow

39:54.767 --> 39:56.686
you and dad were looking

39:54.767 --> 39:56.686
for a house for me?

39:56.728 --> 39:59.147
Well, you didn't think we wanted

39:56.728 --> 39:59.147
to live there, did you?

39:59.189 --> 40:01.816
'Small-town charm is good

39:59.189 --> 40:01.816
for a weekend, Lorelai'

40:01.858 --> 40:04.027
but I have no interest

40:01.858 --> 40:04.027
in having a next-door neighbor

40:04.069 --> 40:05.778
walk in with a pie,

40:04.069 --> 40:05.778
wanting to chat.

40:05.820 --> 40:08.656
I would kill myself

40:05.820 --> 40:08.656
and my neighbors.

40:08.698 --> 40:10.867
'Now, I'm sure Luke

40:08.698 --> 40:10.867
will need some convincing.'

40:10.909 --> 40:12.493
'He doesn't look like

40:10.909 --> 40:12.493
the kind of man'

40:12.535 --> 40:15.121
'who willingly takes

40:12.535 --> 40:15.121
extravagant gifts from people'

40:15.163 --> 40:17.999
'so I've concocted a few good

40:15.163 --> 40:17.999
lies we can tell him.'

40:18.041 --> 40:20.877
'It's for his own good, and once

40:18.041 --> 40:20.877
the two of you in the house--'

40:20.919 --> 40:22.795
It's not gonna happen.

40:22.837 --> 40:25.423
What? Well, of course it will.

40:25.464 --> 40:27.675
If we have to pay

40:25.464 --> 40:27.675
more than the asking price

40:27.717 --> 40:29.635
your father and I

40:27.717 --> 40:29.635
are totally prepared--

40:29.677 --> 40:32.430
Luke and I..

40:32.471 --> 40:34.307
The wedding..

40:34.349 --> 40:35.767
...it's not gonna happen.

40:37.518 --> 40:38.519
What?

40:42.481 --> 40:44.025
[sniffling]

40:52.075 --> 40:54.953
[guitar strumming]

40:57.455 --> 40:58.539
(Sookie)

40:57.455 --> 40:58.539
Jackson!

40:58.581 --> 41:00.166
- Keep up.

40:58.581 --> 41:00.166
- Stop trotting.

41:00.208 --> 41:01.793
(Jackson)

41:00.208 --> 41:01.793
We're on a mission here.

41:01.834 --> 41:04.087
(Sookie)

41:01.834 --> 41:04.087
The faster we move

41:01.834 --> 41:04.087
the more chance

41:04.129 --> 41:05.797
there is we'll draw attention.

41:05.838 --> 41:08.591
No, the slower we move,

41:05.838 --> 41:08.591
the more time there is

41:08.633 --> 41:10.676
to have people's attention

41:08.633 --> 41:10.676
drawn to us.

41:10.718 --> 41:12.220
I'm toting

41:10.718 --> 41:12.220
heavy bags here.

41:12.262 --> 41:13.263
Don't say that out loud.

41:13.305 --> 41:14.973
I didn't say what's in the bag.

41:15.014 --> 41:16.891
And not saying what's in the bag

41:15.014 --> 41:16.891
is going to make people think

41:16.933 --> 41:18.893
that we have something

41:16.933 --> 41:18.893
in it that we're hiding.

41:18.935 --> 41:19.894
Narcs!

41:24.149 --> 41:26.276
What the hell are the Petersons

41:24.149 --> 41:26.276
doing out this late?

41:26.318 --> 41:28.945
[panting]

41:26.318 --> 41:28.945
They're bad. They're bad people.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.448
Said the people trying

41:28.987 --> 41:31.448
to ditch a kilo of weed.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.865
Sookie, the code word!

41:32.907 --> 41:35.701
Pickles, pickles!

41:32.907 --> 41:35.701
I know, the-the pickles!

41:35.743 --> 41:38.246
So let's just get rid

41:35.743 --> 41:38.246
of this and go home.

41:38.288 --> 41:40.332
[both grunting]

41:40.373 --> 41:42.625
- Oh, God.

41:40.373 --> 41:42.625
- Oh, hey, you two. What's up?

41:42.667 --> 41:44.043
- Nothing.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.043
- Nothing's going on here.

41:44.085 --> 41:45.420
I just got

41:44.085 --> 41:45.420
the most incredible news.

41:45.462 --> 41:47.255
A tour manager was walking

41:45.462 --> 41:47.255
around town

41:47.297 --> 41:49.341
and he heard me sing, and he

41:47.297 --> 41:49.341
asked me to open for Neil Young

41:49.382 --> 41:50.633
on a bunch

41:49.382 --> 41:50.633
of East coast dates.

41:50.675 --> 41:52.885
- Great.

41:50.675 --> 41:52.885
- See ya.

41:52.927 --> 41:55.096
- That was close. Wait.

41:52.927 --> 41:55.096
- Does Neil toke?

41:55.138 --> 41:57.890
We could give all of this to the

41:55.138 --> 41:57.890
town troubadour to give to him.

41:57.932 --> 41:59.642
I think if he tokes,

41:57.932 --> 41:59.642
he's already got a connection.

41:59.684 --> 42:00.977
Of course.

41:59.684 --> 42:00.977
He's Neil Young.

42:01.019 --> 42:02.395
[gasping]

42:02.437 --> 42:04.356
- 'Reverend Skinner.'

42:02.437 --> 42:04.356
- 'Rabbi Moranz.'

42:04.397 --> 42:06.607
- Hello, you two.

42:04.397 --> 42:06.607
- What are you doing this late?

42:06.649 --> 42:08.318
Yeah, what are

42:06.649 --> 42:08.318
you doing out this late?

42:08.360 --> 42:10.236
Archie and I like to take

42:08.360 --> 42:10.236
a stroll around town at night.

42:10.278 --> 42:12.280
- It's so quiet.

42:10.278 --> 42:12.280
- Good time to talk philosophy.

42:12.322 --> 42:13.698
Good time to talk about God.

42:13.739 --> 42:15.367
Yes, it's a great time

42:13.739 --> 42:15.367
to talk about God.

42:15.408 --> 42:16.742
He's a good guy, that God.

42:16.784 --> 42:19.871
- Would you like to join us?

42:16.784 --> 42:19.871
- No!

42:19.912 --> 42:22.581
- We're going to hell.

42:19.912 --> 42:22.581
- Just keep running.

42:22.623 --> 42:23.666
[knock on door]

42:23.708 --> 42:24.709
(Sookie)

42:23.708 --> 42:24.709
'Who is it?'

42:24.750 --> 42:25.710
(Lorelai)

42:24.750 --> 42:25.710
'Me.'

42:27.295 --> 42:28.587
- Oh.

42:27.295 --> 42:28.587
- Hey!

42:28.629 --> 42:30.256
(Sookie)

42:28.629 --> 42:30.256
'Honey, what are

42:28.629 --> 42:30.256
you doing here?'

42:30.298 --> 42:32.217
- Can I come in?

42:30.298 --> 42:32.217
- Uh, of course.

42:32.258 --> 42:34.427
Come on in.

42:34.469 --> 42:37.805
- Can we get you something?

42:34.469 --> 42:37.805
- Um, no, thanks.

42:37.847 --> 42:40.308
I just need to hang out

42:37.847 --> 42:40.308
for a while.

42:40.350 --> 42:42.477
- Sit, honey.

42:40.350 --> 42:42.477
- 'Yeah, sit.'

42:42.519 --> 42:43.520
Thanks.

42:46.064 --> 42:49.526

42:49.567 --> 42:51.152
[exhales deeply]

42:59.952 --> 43:01.620
What's that smell?

43:01.662 --> 43:03.081
Sixty eight pounds of marijuana.

43:04.416 --> 43:05.666
Hmm.
