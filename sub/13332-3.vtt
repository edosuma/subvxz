WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:08.274 --> 00:10.243
Newcastle? Done.

00:10.310 --> 00:11.544
Cancun? Done.

00:12.445 --> 00:14.280
Australia? You're getting done.

00:15.315 --> 00:18.184
The Geordies are going Down Under.
To Australia!

00:18.251 --> 00:21.187
And deep into the bush.
(screaming)

00:23.123 --> 00:25.525
Throw another shrimp on the barbie.

00:26.926 --> 00:28.728
This one's gonna be the best yet.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.531
(Vicky) This is a fucking war.

00:35.135 --> 00:36.736
You know what this is? Karma.

00:36.803 --> 00:39.372
I'm ignoring James,
it's the best thing for us.

00:39.439 --> 00:42.308
We can't really
be around each other.

00:45.245 --> 00:47.747
(all) Bye, Jay!
Now it's back to just me

00:47.814 --> 00:49.883
and two lads
who couldn't give a shit.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.586
This is my first date since Ricci.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.557
What's the matter?
I really miss Mitch

00:57.624 --> 01:01.227
and every day it seems like
it's just getting harder and harder.

01:01.294 --> 01:04.897
She's lost that wild, funny side.
Her and Gary aren't getting on,

01:04.964 --> 01:07.867
but why should that make her
lose the person she is?

01:07.934 --> 01:11.004
Are yous taking the fucking piss?
You got Sophie and Vicky

01:11.070 --> 01:14.040
against Charlotte and Holly
and it's going off.

01:14.107 --> 01:16.810
Don't lose sight of everyone else
cos when you do,

01:16.876 --> 01:20.346
you start to lose sight of yourself.
Especially not that bitch.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.283
Don't get me involved.
Don't get involved.

01:23.349 --> 01:26.319
I'm using this to my advantage.
Head down, pull girls.

01:26.386 --> 01:28.455
Three girls, one bed, night-night.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.494
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:34.561 --> 01:36.663
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:36.729 --> 01:38.898
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:38.965 --> 01:40.967
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:41.034 --> 01:43.102
I could talk
the back legs off a donkey.

01:43.169 --> 01:45.405
I'm fit, flirty and I've got FFs.

01:45.638 --> 01:47.907
Hardest graft I've ever done
is my hair.

01:47.974 --> 01:49.809
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:07.627 --> 02:09.628
What the fuck has happened tonight?

02:09.696 --> 02:12.565
We've been arguing and shock,
look what's happened.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.468
Gaz walks in with three birds
and one looks familiar.

02:15.535 --> 02:17.403
The bird I pulled the other night.

02:17.470 --> 02:20.206
If I brought I bird back
that Gaz had pulled,

02:20.273 --> 02:22.008
he'd flap around
like a budgie.

02:31.518 --> 02:35.421
I'm sick of this constant
competition between Gaz and Scott.

02:35.488 --> 02:38.525
We need to end it now.
Howay, lads. Who's the alpha male?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.736
Shut up. Just leave wor alone.

02:52.038 --> 02:54.874
Enjoy me sloppy seconds, kid.
Liberty.

02:56.809 --> 02:59.312
This is why I love Australia.

03:26.172 --> 03:27.373
Last night was epic.

03:27.440 --> 03:31.044
However, after years of experience,
one thing I've learned

03:31.110 --> 03:33.746
is if I get the girls
I've pulled out in the morning

03:33.813 --> 03:37.050
before our girls wake up,
life is much easier.

03:40.186 --> 03:43.456
I find out that Gaz
didn't even bang any of these birds.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.391
He just had a slumber party.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.896
(Sophie) No work today, everyone!
(Charlotte) Yes!

03:49.963 --> 03:52.599
What happened last night?
Don't get me started.

03:52.665 --> 03:54.968
I think something happened to us,
you know.

03:55.034 --> 03:57.704
Last night we all got so mortal

03:57.770 --> 04:01.541
all the girls ended up arguing
and I got kicked out of the club.

04:01.608 --> 04:04.143
We've all woke up this morning
and I'm thinking,

04:04.210 --> 04:06.613
"Shit, is this gonna be
completely awkward?"

04:06.679 --> 04:10.617
Everyone was enjoying themselves
and then you snapped at me and Vicky

04:10.683 --> 04:12.852
because we looked nice.

04:12.919 --> 04:16.089
I didn't come to Australia
to argue with my best friends.

04:16.154 --> 04:20.159
I feel like now I just want to stop
getting so angry when I'm drunk

04:20.226 --> 04:24.263
and just try and convince myself
to just go and find some nice boys.

04:24.330 --> 04:25.498
Hiya.
Hiya.

04:25.565 --> 04:28.968
I told them what happened, Vicky.
Had yous forgotten?

04:29.802 --> 04:31.704
Oh, yeah. Looking very sheepish.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.974
It doesn't make sense.
Us girls never argue.

04:35.041 --> 04:38.778
If anyone, it should be the lads
cos they always slag each other off.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.747
They're so two-faced.

04:40.813 --> 04:43.916
What about you, dill hole?
I forgot!

04:43.983 --> 04:46.119
Y-You forgot?
Yeah!

04:46.185 --> 04:49.288
That doesn't make it any better,
like you didn't do it.

04:49.355 --> 04:51.224
Vicky's asking for an apology

04:51.290 --> 04:54.861
but I don't know if she deserves one.
I don't know what happened.

04:54.927 --> 04:57.664
We're sorry.
Bitches!

04:57.730 --> 04:59.866
That sucks!
That sucks.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.105
We need a family day,

05:06.172 --> 05:09.976
and what better than get on a yacht
and sailing round the Harbour Bridge?

05:10.043 --> 05:13.680
Vicky can't, cos she gets sea sick
but we're gonna have a wicked day.

05:13.746 --> 05:16.482
I excepted some sort of
big cruise liner.

05:16.549 --> 05:19.018
I thought I was gonna stand
like Kate Winslet

05:19.085 --> 05:20.687
and pretend I was on Titanic.

05:20.753 --> 05:23.322
A sailing boat?!
Who the fuck wants to sail?

05:23.389 --> 05:25.825
Shit, it's so choppy, isn't it?

05:25.892 --> 05:29.896
James and Holly aren't speaking
so they're at opposite ends.

05:29.962 --> 05:32.398
Me and Gary still don't
really converse

05:32.465 --> 05:34.500
so we're at opposite ends.

05:34.567 --> 05:39.172
Sophie and Scott don't give a shit
but are probably at opposite ends.

05:39.238 --> 05:43.009
Looks like a big fuck-off
Tyne Bridge. Like being at home.

05:43.076 --> 05:46.045
I wouldn't go down the Tyne
on this boat, it would stink.

05:46.112 --> 05:48.848
(laughs) Smell like walking in
the girls' bedroom.

05:48.915 --> 05:51.084
Me and Gaz have both had
our problems,

05:51.150 --> 05:53.252
him with Charlotte
and me with Holly.

05:53.319 --> 05:56.789
But for now, at least things
are civil. It's fine by me.

06:17.844 --> 06:21.380
I think it's absolutely ridiculous
that Gaz has got to the point

06:21.447 --> 06:24.283
where he feels he has to
take girls out during the day

06:24.350 --> 06:27.854
just to get one over on Scott.
They're meant to be mates.

06:29.789 --> 06:33.292
How do you like being in control?
I love it, it's mint.

06:33.359 --> 06:35.828
You're a good captain.
Is he a good captain?

06:35.895 --> 06:37.864
He's steering really well.

06:37.930 --> 06:40.466
James is still trying to be
friends with Holly,

06:40.533 --> 06:42.301
Holly's still having none of it.

06:42.368 --> 06:44.570
You could cut the tension
with a knife.

06:44.637 --> 06:46.272
What do yous think of it, then?

06:47.406 --> 06:50.109
I think James is trying
to make conversation

06:50.176 --> 06:52.678
but the conversation is boring me.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.180
Want a go on this?
Nah.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.383
Oh, God, James, careful.
I don't feel you're looking.

06:57.450 --> 07:01.120
James, just concentrate on
driving this fucking boat.

07:01.187 --> 07:02.855
I am, I'm watching.

07:02.922 --> 07:06.759
I don't think me and Holly should
force ourselves to be friends again.

07:06.826 --> 07:09.162
I think this is
just gonna take time.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.864
Today has been a wicked day.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.967
We've sailed a boat under the bridge
past the opera house

07:15.034 --> 07:18.371
but surprise, surprise,
the girls still aren't impressed.

07:18.437 --> 07:21.007
Let's shout abuse
at that other boat.

07:21.073 --> 07:24.911
Boat wankers!
(they laugh)

07:33.719 --> 07:38.090
All I want from tonight is
to go out, get drunk, be happy,

07:38.157 --> 07:41.928
have all the family together
and not cause any shit for once.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.407
We're all hyped up,
ready to have the best night ever.

07:55.775 --> 07:59.045
The dance floor's full,
the tequila's flowing.

07:59.111 --> 08:01.948
Now it's time to do what we do best
and get mortal.

08:03.516 --> 08:05.651
Me and the girls are having
so much fun.

08:05.718 --> 08:08.254
We've put the fight behind us.
It's in the past

08:08.321 --> 08:11.023
and everyone's dancing,
and I'm even drinking.

08:11.090 --> 08:12.792
Charlotte's back.

08:19.365 --> 08:21.901
So the night's actually
becoming really good

08:21.968 --> 08:23.769
and Scott's flirting with me

08:23.836 --> 08:27.206
and I'm wondering where
he thinks this is gonna go.

08:27.273 --> 08:28.808
Not tonight, Scott.

09:04.644 --> 09:07.947
Me and the lasses are tired, hungry.
We want a kebab and bed.

09:08.014 --> 09:11.183
We look at the lads and they're
still having a good time

09:11.250 --> 09:14.253
and it's so nice to see
James being properly involved.

09:17.723 --> 09:20.927
I'm trying to convince James to stay,
I'm trying me best.

09:20.993 --> 09:23.296
I want him to stay
and get involved.

09:23.362 --> 09:24.697
The lasses had enough

09:24.764 --> 09:28.534
but Gaz insists the lads aren't
gonna pull till the last minute.

09:28.601 --> 09:31.103
So I'm gonna stay and try
and have a laugh.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.181
Gaz is full of shit.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.251
After that massive speech
about the lads not pulling,

09:45.318 --> 09:46.786
in rocks two birds.

09:47.586 --> 09:50.189
Two girls start speaking
to me and Scott

09:50.256 --> 09:51.824
and out the blue he has a fit.

09:51.891 --> 09:52.892
James!

09:52.959 --> 09:56.629
It's come to the point where I can't
even have five minutes' craic

09:56.696 --> 09:58.965
without them getting
fucking birds in.

09:59.031 --> 10:00.666
Fuck this. I'm off.

10:13.012 --> 10:16.949
All of a sudden, James comes storming
out of the club and he looks angry.

10:25.925 --> 10:29.328
James has reached the end of
his tether and I'm not surprised.

10:29.395 --> 10:32.798
He's made no secret that
he wants to be more integrated

10:32.865 --> 10:36.102
but he can't when they're pulling.
He's got a girlfriend.

10:36.168 --> 10:37.903
And this is the final straw.

10:51.650 --> 10:53.519
This has been coming for so long.

10:53.586 --> 10:57.490
There was tension there, and it's
built for so long it's just blew up.

11:05.398 --> 11:08.534
Know what pisses me off? James.
He's always complaining

11:08.601 --> 11:11.804
about not getting involved,
so we try and he throws a fit.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.250
I feel like everyone's seen him
for what I've seen him for.

11:24.316 --> 11:25.885
A fucking scumbag.

11:25.951 --> 11:28.454
(shouting, screaming)

11:30.256 --> 11:33.692
My mission tonight is to pull.
They're being slags.

11:34.727 --> 11:37.897
You could put me and Scott on
the moon. We'd still find birds.

11:37.963 --> 11:39.932
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

11:42.668 --> 11:42.868
.

11:45.504 --> 11:45.704
.

12:05.124 --> 12:07.526
I know that
I'm not speaking to James,

12:07.593 --> 12:09.728
but I feel I've got to do
the right thing,

12:09.795 --> 12:12.465
and the right thing
is being on his side right now.

12:12.531 --> 12:16.869
I'm getting really nervous because
I know shit is gonna go right down.

12:16.936 --> 12:20.840
And when they all come in,
we need to get up, stand our ground.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.641
You're not welcome here at all.

12:22.708 --> 12:27.947
Charlotte's basically ring-leading
this whole facade. It's so weird.

12:28.013 --> 12:31.417
She's just letting all this
anger out that she's always felt.

12:31.484 --> 12:35.488
"Do not treat this house like a
hotel," that's what we need to say.

12:36.322 --> 12:39.091
Suddenly it's like
a scene from The Lion King.

12:39.158 --> 12:43.462
We are a pride of lions
protecting our territory

12:43.529 --> 12:47.133
and look who's walked up the stairs,
Pumbaa and fucking Timon.

12:47.199 --> 12:48.868
(they talk over each other)

12:48.934 --> 12:52.338
Get off. Yous find
somewhere fucking else to stay.

12:52.404 --> 12:55.608
I'm telling you now,
find somewhere else to stay!

12:55.674 --> 12:57.977
The thing I'm most pissed off about

12:58.043 --> 13:01.080
is the fact that Gaz stood and lied
straight to my face,

13:01.147 --> 13:04.383
saying they weren't gonna
pull girls. Fucking bullshit.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.253
The kid doesn't give a fuck
about anyone but himself.

13:07.319 --> 13:10.055
It's what happens every single night.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.159
What do you want us to do
when we're single fucking lads?

13:13.225 --> 13:14.560
(shouting, screaming)

13:14.627 --> 13:17.630
As soon as he raises his voice,
that's when I'm in.

13:20.533 --> 13:23.903
As much as I would love to jump
over this piano and get at James,

13:23.969 --> 13:27.206
it's not worth losing my place
in the Geordie Shore house.

13:27.273 --> 13:29.008
(they shout over each other)

13:30.509 --> 13:33.179
Gaz is going off on one.
Obviously the truth hurts.

13:33.245 --> 13:34.747
Fucking bellend.

13:35.948 --> 13:37.850
I hope Gaz and James sort it out.

13:37.917 --> 13:41.120
Otherwise I'll go nuts and
they don't want to see me go nuts.

13:41.187 --> 13:43.255
I'll turn that piano
into a bird house.

13:43.322 --> 13:46.192
(yelling, screaming)

13:51.797 --> 13:53.399
YOu don't give a fuck!

13:53.465 --> 13:57.736
Finally I feel like everyone's
seen him for what I've seen him for.

13:57.803 --> 13:59.705
A fucking scumbag.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.207
Go now! Go!

14:01.273 --> 14:03.842
I'm not taking sides
and Gaz is going nuts,

14:03.909 --> 14:05.911
so it's time
to get him out the house.

14:11.550 --> 14:14.653
Me and James are done.
I know I can have a good time here.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.755
As for him, he's fucked.

14:18.224 --> 14:22.528
It's about time that Gaz got knocked
off that pedestal he put himself on.

14:22.595 --> 14:26.632
He's walked about the house for too
long thinking that he's the king.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.936
We've finally all got a common bond.

14:31.003 --> 14:33.672
Everyone hates Gary.

14:44.516 --> 14:47.786
So we have got what we wanted,
the boys have left.

14:47.853 --> 14:49.622
Scott's gone and so has Gary.

14:49.688 --> 14:53.525
And all that we are left with
is angry people and a broken piano.

14:55.227 --> 14:58.163
We did what was right.
We did what was fucking right.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.199
That high-five that me and James had

15:00.266 --> 15:03.636
was the most physical contact
we've had in the past year.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.338
I am happy that me and James

15:06.405 --> 15:09.441
are actually beginning
to build a friendship up again,

15:09.508 --> 15:12.978
because I didn't want to be childish
and hold a grudge forever.

15:13.045 --> 15:15.948
It just wasn't easy
to forgive him in the beginning.

15:16.015 --> 15:18.050
Too much had gone on.
(laughter)

15:18.117 --> 15:19.685
Fucking daft cunt.

15:28.227 --> 15:29.628
Last night was mental.

15:29.695 --> 15:31.897
I can't believe
how out of hand it got.

15:31.964 --> 15:33.999
I didn't expect this
in a million years.

15:34.066 --> 15:36.402
This has brought
so many positive things.

15:36.468 --> 15:38.904
It's made James feel united
with the girls,

15:38.971 --> 15:41.707
it's made Holly and James
be friends again,

15:41.774 --> 15:44.877
and it's made me
the happiest I've ever been.

15:44.943 --> 15:47.680
I can't believe
I wasted two years of my life

15:47.746 --> 15:49.748
actually thinking I liked Gary.

15:49.815 --> 15:52.318
Where's James?
I knew you were gonna say it.

15:52.384 --> 15:55.788
Sophie goes to check on James
and he's gone. Eh?

15:55.854 --> 15:58.257
We stood up for you.
You should stay with us.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.292
He's been kicked out.

16:00.359 --> 16:02.361
Unless he's just left.

16:02.428 --> 16:06.298
Sheep Steve has clearly been in
and took all the boys.

16:06.365 --> 16:08.734
The girls have the house
to themselves.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.769
To the wombs!
To the wombs!

16:10.836 --> 16:12.137
To ovaries!

16:12.204 --> 16:14.440
Right now,
we've got a house full of girls

16:14.506 --> 16:16.909
and it's what we've always wanted.

16:16.975 --> 16:21.580
(chanting)
No boys! No boys! No boys! No boys!

16:21.647 --> 16:23.849
We're so excited,
we're running round,

16:23.916 --> 16:27.853
screaming female things like
ovaries and wombs and periods.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.288
(all cheer)

16:33.792 --> 16:36.028
Not got a womb,
don't bother coming.

16:36.095 --> 16:38.530
No cock here either! Whoo!

16:38.597 --> 16:41.400
What to do
when it's just the lasses?

16:41.467 --> 16:44.336
Cocks, canapes
and cocktails for everyone!

16:44.403 --> 16:45.537
I'm gonna wee!

16:45.604 --> 16:50.409
"No work, no boys, very unimpressed
with behaviour. Steve."

17:04.790 --> 17:07.559
Last night was crazy
and things got way out of hand.

17:07.626 --> 17:11.296
Once again me and Scott got
loads of aggro about pulling girls

17:11.363 --> 17:13.298
and leaving James with the girls.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.635
Fuck it. We'll go on a road trip
and have our own fun.

17:24.309 --> 17:27.079
No more lasses whinging,
no more James being a fanny,

17:27.146 --> 17:28.847
just the dream team on a mission.

17:33.685 --> 17:36.422
I don't understand
why Charlotte is doing this.

17:36.488 --> 17:40.559
She's being so evil and just trying
to manipulate and start arguments.

17:47.199 --> 17:51.637
I feel for Mitch in a total way
I ever thought I felt for Gary.

17:51.703 --> 17:54.540
Yeah.
Like, this is... like, really strong.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.809
Obviously
you don't get on with Gary,

17:56.875 --> 18:00.279
so that just makes it awful
and awkward a bit.

18:00.345 --> 18:05.684
I feel like Sophie, out of everyone,
sees that I've changed and moved on.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.520
I'm so glad I've got her here
to be there for us.

18:08.587 --> 18:11.523
You've been through so much
with that horrible dick.

18:11.590 --> 18:15.160
He destroyed you and the awful
things he used to say and do to you

18:15.227 --> 18:17.830
cos you've got a new boy,
good, go and be happy.

18:19.631 --> 18:24.336
Like, I am, right, but...
Right, basically...

18:24.403 --> 18:26.538
Oh, God.
I don't know how to tell you,

18:26.605 --> 18:32.144
but I've knew before I came here
that Joel was gonna come.

18:33.345 --> 18:36.849
So you've got something
to look forward to. Yeah.

18:36.915 --> 18:38.817
I just hope that when Joel comes,

18:38.884 --> 18:42.588
Charlotte won't get upset and think
about her relationship at home.

18:42.654 --> 18:46.125
If he wasn't coming,
I would be exactly like you.

18:46.191 --> 18:48.327
Joel's coming out to see Sophie.

18:48.393 --> 18:50.729
I'm worried I'm gonna lose
my best friend

18:50.796 --> 18:52.331
and then have no-one left.

18:52.397 --> 18:56.502
I'm the longest-lasting relationship
in the whole of Geordie Shore.

18:56.568 --> 18:58.403
Everyone else's have been a joke.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.906
I know mine have in the past
but look at us now.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.841
I'm strong and I love my boyfriend.

19:02.908 --> 19:05.143
I want to spend the rest of my life
with him.

19:12.351 --> 19:16.054
I've been kicked out and made to
stay in this absolute dive.

19:16.121 --> 19:19.691
I'm bored out my mind
but at least I get to speak to Kate.

19:19.758 --> 19:21.760
It kicked off a bit
back at the house.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.663
Them twos, Scott and Gaz,
went to a hotel,

19:24.730 --> 19:27.966
and I'm in this fucking shitty...
I look like a scruff.

19:28.033 --> 19:29.968
I regret getting so angry,

19:30.035 --> 19:33.705
but this thing with me and Gaz
has been building up for so long.

19:33.772 --> 19:36.975
They don't talk about anything
but themselves and shagging.

19:37.042 --> 19:38.677
It's not normal lad craic.

19:38.744 --> 19:43.348
It's just, like... trying to
big themselves up all the time.

19:45.784 --> 19:48.854
Of course you're not gonna think
they're good-looking.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.522
Have you seen your boyfriend?

19:50.589 --> 19:53.926
Enough of me and this shit hotel.
Did you get your surprise?

19:58.130 --> 19:59.298
Bigger than you?

19:59.364 --> 20:02.401
I'm so lucky to have a nice girl
at home like Kate

20:02.467 --> 20:04.336
who's there for us no matter what.

20:04.403 --> 20:07.639
I feel sorry for people who haven't,
like Gary.

20:16.915 --> 20:19.918
(Vicky)
To whatever drunk we end up, ladies.

20:19.985 --> 20:22.854
Cheers. Ladies' day.
(Sophie) Ladies' day.

20:22.921 --> 20:24.723
Not missing the boys whatsoever

20:24.790 --> 20:27.960
cos they add nothing to the group
apart from cock.

20:28.026 --> 20:29.661
This feels normal.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.196
I feel happy.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.301
I know what you mean.

20:36.368 --> 20:39.805
If one good thing came out of it,
me and James are friends again.

20:39.871 --> 20:41.239
Every cloud.
I know.

20:41.306 --> 20:44.576
I just felt like I know
what's right, you know what I mean?

20:44.643 --> 20:47.279
Even though we weren't speaking,
we are a family

20:47.346 --> 20:49.581
and you have to stick up
for what's right.

20:49.648 --> 20:51.717
When I saw Holly and James high-five,

20:51.783 --> 20:55.120
it was like watching
a gazelle and a lion cuddle.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.789
What we can do
now all the boys have gone...

20:57.856 --> 20:59.424
What?
Masturbate.

21:00.392 --> 21:02.694
You like the power shower, don't you?

21:02.761 --> 21:03.762
Urgh!

21:03.829 --> 21:06.865
What happens? Do you put it
right on it or just the shower?

21:06.932 --> 21:08.133
Just a little bit out.

21:08.200 --> 21:12.004
They decide that with the boys gone,
we should spend our time wisely,

21:12.070 --> 21:14.840
masturbate in showers,
walk around naked...

21:14.906 --> 21:17.576
This does not sound like
my idea of a good day.

21:17.643 --> 21:21.179
Why don't we all try it tonight
in every shower in the house?

21:21.246 --> 21:23.815
I don't need to be
part of this experiment.

21:23.882 --> 21:25.884
So you've never masturbated, Vicky?

21:25.951 --> 21:29.921
No, Sophie, I don't want to have
this conversation. (laughter)

21:36.161 --> 21:40.365
We have been driving for hours.
We are far enough away from Sydney.

21:40.432 --> 21:42.901
It looks like
we're in a Wild West film.

21:42.968 --> 21:46.304
Everything is made out of wood.
Ah, well. Snap!

21:47.305 --> 21:50.575
Everyone back home is probably
whinging about last night,

21:50.642 --> 21:54.079
whereas me and Gaz are getting ready
to take this town by storm.

21:58.350 --> 22:00.285
I don't know what's gonna happen.

22:00.352 --> 22:02.287
All I know is there's me and Scott,

22:02.354 --> 22:05.057
and that means no aggro,
no grief from the house,

22:05.123 --> 22:07.192
just me and him having fun.

22:10.829 --> 22:14.499
Even though we're in a mining town
with a population of like, 100,

22:14.566 --> 22:16.068
96 fellas and four girls,

22:16.134 --> 22:18.437
there's still four girls
ready to pull.

22:19.705 --> 22:23.975
You could put me and Scott
on the moon. We'd still find birds.

22:24.042 --> 22:28.313
Gaz has got his bird, I've got
my bird, hashtag "pure legends".

22:37.055 --> 22:39.825
So we've had the canapes,
we've had the cocktails,

22:39.891 --> 22:41.126
now it's on to the cock.

22:45.397 --> 22:49.267
My mission tonight is to pull
and I wanna pull first.

22:53.171 --> 22:55.841
It's looking good for Holly.
She's got a lad in.

22:55.907 --> 22:58.944
Now all she needs to do
is not bore him, get her tits out

22:59.010 --> 23:00.645
and suck on his tongue.

23:04.850 --> 23:07.586
Because I'm not that good
at chatting people up,

23:07.652 --> 23:10.522
I'm asking the first thing
that comes into me head.

23:14.159 --> 23:16.895
Holly's chat-up lines
are absolutely shit.

23:23.635 --> 23:25.003
Where you from?

23:28.807 --> 23:31.409
I am being the best wing woman
for Vicky here.

23:31.476 --> 23:36.181
I can see a boy that she likes,
but there's a language barrier.

23:36.248 --> 23:39.050
French?! Fuck's sake.

23:44.156 --> 23:47.425
My French isn't what it was,
but I know enough to get by.

23:47.492 --> 23:51.396
Voulez-vous tash on avec moi, pet?

23:53.031 --> 23:55.867
The single girls are going in,
they're being slags.

23:58.203 --> 24:02.140
I've actually pulled a boy.
Like, a real one. I've kissed him!

24:02.207 --> 24:04.609
It wasn't that good
but at least I did it.

24:05.811 --> 24:08.513
What a successful females' day.

24:09.681 --> 24:13.051
I can't help but hope that
the boys are having no fun at all,

24:13.118 --> 24:15.654
and they are getting tortured
by Sheep Steve.

24:21.760 --> 24:24.963
I absolutely love Australian girls.
I'm a proper machine.

24:25.030 --> 24:28.433
I might as well be a fucking
nail gun cos I nail everything.

24:29.734 --> 24:31.970
I'm banging,
hopefully Scott's banging.

24:32.037 --> 24:35.040
That proves the dream team
can go any corners of the Earth

24:35.106 --> 24:36.441
and pull it out the bag.

24:38.643 --> 24:41.146
Gary isn't the person
who you think he is.

24:41.213 --> 24:43.882
Sounds like Charlotte
hasn't forgiven or forgot.

24:43.949 --> 24:47.252
Walking over and James and Charlotte
have faces like thunder.

24:47.319 --> 24:50.088
Honestly, just get a life
and get out of mine.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.324
It's starting to get pathetic.

24:52.390 --> 24:55.627
Me and Scott are in bed.
We can't stop touching each other.

24:55.694 --> 24:57.062
Look at my dick.

24:57.128 --> 24:59.231
Scott is gonna regret this.

25:00.532 --> 25:02.601
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

25:05.237 --> 25:05.437
.

25:07.973 --> 25:08.173
.

25:17.415 --> 25:18.984
Fucking hell, it's bright.

25:19.050 --> 25:20.886
Last night was proper mint.

25:20.952 --> 25:23.421
We made the most of the bush
in the outback.

25:23.488 --> 25:27.492
Amazing sex, wicked banter,
we had a laugh, no drama, done.

25:28.727 --> 25:31.129
Me and Scott have been having
all this fun,

25:31.196 --> 25:33.632
then realise we have to go
and face everyone.

25:34.466 --> 25:37.669
I reckon Gaz really doesn't want to
go back and see the others,

25:37.736 --> 25:41.640
especially Charlotte and James.
He can't be arsed with the drama.

25:41.706 --> 25:45.176
What do you reckon she's gonna be
like when we get back? A bitch.

25:45.243 --> 25:48.280
She'll be a grade A bitch.
She'll try and split us up.

25:48.346 --> 25:50.415
I haven't seen the fun Charlotte yet.

25:50.482 --> 25:52.884
All I've seen
is this stressy fucking bitch

25:52.951 --> 25:55.186
who's trying to
spoil everyone's time.

25:55.253 --> 25:58.323
It's about time we ring the house,
tell them where we are

25:58.390 --> 26:01.760
and we're on the way back.
They probably don't give a shit.

26:04.129 --> 26:05.664
(phone rings)

26:06.831 --> 26:08.533
Hello?
"Hello."

26:08.600 --> 26:10.568
Hi, Scott. Where have you been?

26:10.635 --> 26:13.705
We just went on a pure mission
in the middle of nowhere,

26:13.772 --> 26:16.441
literally in the sticks.
A four-hour drive.

26:16.508 --> 26:20.412
I was under the impression that the
lads were sent away and punished.

26:20.478 --> 26:24.482
The only explanation is that he's
sucking off Sheep-shagger Steve.

26:24.549 --> 26:27.485
"Are you still with Gary?"
Yeah, he's in the car now.

26:27.552 --> 26:29.988
"Gary isn't the person
who you think he is."

26:30.055 --> 26:33.224
You might think he's your friend
but he will fuck you over.

26:33.291 --> 26:36.861
Charlotte hasn't forgiven or forgot.
She's pissed off with Gaz

26:36.928 --> 26:39.664
and taking it all out on me.
What are yous doing?

26:39.731 --> 26:42.467
"We're going to the beach
and gonna go bowling."

26:42.534 --> 26:46.738
If you want to come along, yous can.
There won't be much conversation.

26:46.805 --> 26:49.674
We'll just see you later on.
"Wicked. See you in a bit."

26:51.109 --> 26:54.779
Apparently they've just been on
a mission around all the suburbs.

26:54.846 --> 26:56.414
(Vicky) Fucking idiots.

27:01.086 --> 27:03.822
We're the only two single people
that wanna pull.

27:03.888 --> 27:06.024
I don't understand the big problem.

27:06.091 --> 27:10.028
She'll happy when I'm by myself.
That's how evil she is.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.134
Welcome home.
Aye.

27:16.201 --> 27:19.004
Girls!
Hello, babe.

27:19.070 --> 27:21.306
What's the craic?
Good to have you back.

27:21.373 --> 27:24.976
I'm buzzing to be back in the house
after the girls stuck up for us.

27:25.043 --> 27:27.946
But I'm not sure what'll happen
when Gaz comes back.

27:28.013 --> 27:30.148
You didn't even do anything wrong.

27:30.215 --> 27:33.118
I'm sick of them going on
like only they shag a lass.

27:33.184 --> 27:35.320
We were all on his side
the other night.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.889
James was in the right
and I'm glad he's back.

27:37.956 --> 27:41.526
I don't think we need to apologise,
we didn't do anything wrong.

27:41.593 --> 27:43.928
They are walking back into our house,

27:43.995 --> 27:46.264
so they can come up to us
and apologise.

27:46.331 --> 27:49.067
So we just keep on acting
like they don't exist.

27:53.638 --> 27:56.307
Me and James should have
resolved this sooner.

27:56.374 --> 28:00.812
It shouldn't have ever got to
the point of me going for him.

28:00.879 --> 28:03.982
We did actually used to be
best friends, you know, like.

28:04.049 --> 28:07.252
Do you remember we actually were
dead close at one point?

28:07.318 --> 28:09.788
Things will never be back
to the way they were.

28:09.854 --> 28:11.890
Far too much has happened
since then.

28:11.956 --> 28:14.259
But I'm pleased
we're making progress.

28:14.325 --> 28:17.762
I never, ever meant
for it to go the way it did.

28:17.829 --> 28:20.665
(groans)
I just try to keep everyone sweet

28:20.732 --> 28:23.501
and fuckin'...
It ended up biting me in the arse.

28:23.568 --> 28:25.637
This is the first time
in a long time

28:25.703 --> 28:28.840
that me and James are having
a conversation together.

28:28.907 --> 28:31.876
We were good together,
we used to bounce off each other

28:31.943 --> 28:35.280
and hopefully we can start to
rebuild that friendship again.

28:35.346 --> 28:37.282
I was like, "Whoa! We high-fived?"

28:37.348 --> 28:40.685
"That's the most we've touched
since Cancun." (laughs)

28:40.752 --> 28:43.054
Friends?
Aye.

28:43.121 --> 28:45.757
Spot on. Yeah?
Yeah.

28:45.824 --> 28:47.225
That's better.

28:50.929 --> 28:53.731
We're all playing bowls
but at the back of our mind,

28:53.798 --> 28:56.668
we know that Scott and Gary
are gonna turn up very soon

28:56.734 --> 28:58.536
and I don't know if it'll kick off.

28:58.603 --> 29:01.439
We've all said he's probably gonna
blame it on me,

29:01.506 --> 29:03.108
but he's got no right to.

29:03.174 --> 29:06.010
I'm not arsed about
that fucking freak any more.

29:07.512 --> 29:09.047
This is about to happen.

29:09.114 --> 29:13.017
My heart's beating through my chest
and I'm actually really nervous.

29:13.084 --> 29:15.420
I hope James and Gary
don't kick off again.

29:15.487 --> 29:16.888
All right?

29:16.955 --> 29:19.691
James and Charlotte
have faces like thunder.

29:19.757 --> 29:22.894
Honestly, just get a life
and get out of mine.

29:22.961 --> 29:24.562
I'm ready for the abuse.

29:24.629 --> 29:27.499
I'm gonna win them over
with my Scotty T smile.

29:27.565 --> 29:29.634
Gaz, on the other hand, is fucked.

29:30.969 --> 29:32.370
Howay, what's the craic?

29:32.437 --> 29:35.673
If this is the start, I dread
to find out what's gonna next.

29:36.808 --> 29:39.611
Gary and Scott are gonna have to
make the first move

29:39.677 --> 29:42.547
because, after all, it's all of us
pissed off at them.

29:47.385 --> 29:50.989
Scott's doing all the talking
and Gary's holding back

29:51.055 --> 29:54.826
like a stray,
abandoned, malnourished dog.

29:54.893 --> 29:56.294
It all came down to the fact

29:56.361 --> 29:58.897
we want to spend more time with yous
as a group,

29:58.963 --> 30:00.765
but there comes a part in the night

30:00.832 --> 30:04.002
where one looks you might pull
and the other one gets scared.

30:04.068 --> 30:05.803
It's starting to get pathetic

30:05.870 --> 30:08.139
and this whole
"yous aren't bothered",

30:08.206 --> 30:10.008
yous so are, it's embarrassing.

30:14.746 --> 30:18.082
I'm even offering only to pull
on certain nights of the week.

30:18.149 --> 30:21.219
I can do Wednesdays, Fridays
and Saturdays, fine by me.

30:21.286 --> 30:24.856
Are you genuinely suggesting
we have a shagging schedule?

30:24.923 --> 30:27.725
Everyone who has to say sorry
and we can all move on.

30:27.792 --> 30:29.827
I'm sorry. Good.
Love yous.

30:32.263 --> 30:36.167
Why am I apologising
about pulling girls?

30:38.670 --> 30:41.573
And we're sorry as well.
Yeah.

30:43.174 --> 30:47.045
I am gonna accept Gaz's apology,
but just for the sake of the house.

30:47.111 --> 30:51.015
I know in a couple of days he'll
just be back to his arsehole self.

30:58.323 --> 31:01.526
Charlotte, Sophie and James
want to stay in tonight,

31:01.593 --> 31:05.129
but the singles wanna go out,
so we have to go out with bellends.

31:05.196 --> 31:07.632
But a night out
is still a fucking night out.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.439
So, tonight is gonna be unreal.

31:14.505 --> 31:18.443
It's just the singles, Scary Canary,
we're gonna get fucked.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.816
Everyone actually looks like
they're having fun.

31:24.882 --> 31:28.319
It turns out when it's
all the singles together, we get on.

31:28.386 --> 31:30.388
Love ya.

31:30.455 --> 31:34.158
Tonight we've decided that we're not
gonna bring any randoms home.

31:34.225 --> 31:36.461
We're just gonna go home,
the four of us,

31:36.527 --> 31:39.564
but that doesn't mean
we couldn't get with each other.

31:41.366 --> 31:44.602
I'm getting a vibe off Holly
that she's after a bit of my pipe.

31:44.669 --> 31:47.038
What the hell?
It's either family or pipe.

31:47.105 --> 31:48.740
You're pure confusing us.

31:48.806 --> 31:52.610
I'm getting more and more drunk
and it's becoming hard not to flirt.

31:52.677 --> 31:54.912
This is the worst situation
I could be in.

31:56.881 --> 32:00.885
This is the first time I've got to
have a laugh with Vicky.

32:02.954 --> 32:06.257
I forgot what the flirty, fun,
banter side of Vicky was like.

32:06.324 --> 32:07.892
And this is her.

32:07.959 --> 32:10.962
Gaz is flirting with Vicky,
Holly's flirting with me.

32:11.029 --> 32:14.632
We're not bringing outside girls in,
it's a family night after all.

32:18.002 --> 32:19.804
I am still homesick.

32:19.871 --> 32:23.675
I'm trying to have a good time, even
though I'm missing Mitch so much.

32:29.047 --> 32:31.749
Out of ten,
how much do you care for him?

32:31.816 --> 32:33.251
Eleven.

32:33.318 --> 32:35.586
Really?
Yeah.

32:45.797 --> 32:48.166
You're not gonna help us, then,
are ya?

32:48.232 --> 32:50.802
Me and Scott are fucking hammered

32:50.868 --> 32:53.271
and I can honestly see
where this is gonna go.

32:55.239 --> 32:57.308
So weird to come back from
a night out,

32:57.375 --> 32:58.810
having a laugh with Vicky,

32:58.876 --> 33:02.680
cos I forgot what the fun banter side
of Vicky was like. And this is her.

33:02.747 --> 33:05.783
Me and Gary are literally
talking about house prices.

33:05.850 --> 33:08.086
So Vicky and Gary
are talking on the floor

33:08.152 --> 33:09.887
and they're having a good time,

33:09.954 --> 33:13.424
but me and Scott are in bed
and can't stop touching each other.

33:13.491 --> 33:15.293
And it's getting awkward now.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.428
I don't know if I'm trying
to turn him on

33:17.495 --> 33:20.131
by telling him
I've got crotchless underwear on.

33:20.198 --> 33:21.799
You can't tell Scotty T that.

33:21.866 --> 33:24.102
If I'm not hearing it,
my fucking chod is.

33:24.168 --> 33:25.603
Look at my dick.

33:25.670 --> 33:29.340
Holly and Scott are taking
getting on well to a different level.

33:29.407 --> 33:31.409
All I'm thinking is,
"I'm off to bed,

33:31.476 --> 33:34.078
but Scott is gonna regret this
in the morning."

33:38.950 --> 33:42.086
I found myself in bed,
Vicky's in the bed next to us,

33:42.153 --> 33:45.189
weirdly flirting with us, I think.
Are you asleep now?

33:45.256 --> 33:46.958
Why?
Are you asleep?

33:53.865 --> 33:56.734
So then it's just me and Scott.
Uh-oh.

33:57.735 --> 34:00.037
I try to not go near the cock,

34:00.104 --> 34:01.606
but it's coming at me,

34:01.672 --> 34:04.409
and I'm getting naked
and then I'm riding it,

34:04.475 --> 34:06.878
and then I'm fucked. literally.

34:06.944 --> 34:09.746
I don't know what it looks like but
I'm deffo not having sex with Holly.

34:09.813 --> 34:11.047
She's having sex with me.

34:11.114 --> 34:13.985
She's taken my wand all the way to
fucking Hogwarts.

34:14.051 --> 34:18.255
The fact this has happened doesn't
mean they'll be any feelings there.

34:18.322 --> 34:19.556
It's family bonding.

34:19.623 --> 34:22.025
This family night
is getting proper weird.

34:23.428 --> 34:26.496
Oh, my God. Why is Gary fully naked?

34:26.563 --> 34:30.268
Fuck me. I'm having a full-on
conversation with Charlotte,

34:30.333 --> 34:33.638
and it actually feels real.
This is dangerous territory.

34:33.704 --> 34:36.107
He's the only person
who's been there for us.

34:36.174 --> 34:39.210
I'm honestly seeing
a different side to Gary.

34:39.277 --> 34:41.411
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

34:44.014 --> 34:44.215
.

34:46.751 --> 34:46.951
.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.503
Shag pad.

35:06.904 --> 35:08.940
Alone?
Ooh!

35:09.006 --> 35:11.075
No, obviously I wasn't alone.

35:13.077 --> 35:15.012
Yeah, we did.
Did ya?

35:15.079 --> 35:16.581
Yeah.

35:16.647 --> 35:18.783
I know.
I fraternised with the enemy.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.585
I don't go out for one night

35:20.651 --> 35:24.689
and Holly's in bed with Scott.
And, apparently, had sex with him.

35:24.755 --> 35:26.891
I didn't know you had proper sex.

35:34.532 --> 35:37.134
Yeah. But it was good, mind.

35:37.201 --> 35:41.405
Me and Scott is completely different
to how me and James started.

35:41.472 --> 35:45.676
I liked him. I really liked him.
But with Scott, we're just friends.

35:45.743 --> 35:49.680
I don't have feeling towards him.
I couldn't bang him sober.

35:49.747 --> 35:52.183
But I'm not bothered
that it happened, like.

35:52.250 --> 35:57.622
I'm quite happy actually, like.
I'm now OK for the next six months.

35:57.688 --> 36:00.424
According to her,
she's not gonna go there again.

36:00.491 --> 36:04.262
She's been there, done it and got
the Scotty fucking T-shirt. Get in!

36:04.328 --> 36:08.266
You don't seem as frustrated
and cranky as yesterday.

36:08.332 --> 36:10.201
It's definitely what I needed.

36:11.369 --> 36:13.104
Yeah.

36:13.170 --> 36:15.506
We said we wanted them
to spend time with us.

36:15.573 --> 36:17.441
I couldn't think of
any better way.

36:24.215 --> 36:27.451
I was fucking smashed. (chuckles)
Absolutely smashed.

36:27.518 --> 36:29.453
Do you want us to stop you in future?

36:29.520 --> 36:32.123
Gaz, you can't talk to me
about going back there

36:32.189 --> 36:34.759
cos you've gone back to Charlotte
since day one.

36:34.825 --> 36:36.327
She knows the craic.

36:37.395 --> 36:40.064
I've heard them famous words before.

36:40.131 --> 36:42.867
I've seen this happen
so many times in this house.

36:42.934 --> 36:44.335
It always goes one way.

36:44.402 --> 36:46.637
Just literally do not go back there.

36:47.872 --> 36:50.007
Do you reckon you will?
Ah, you know me.

36:50.074 --> 36:51.742
Go back to Holly? Nah, mate.

36:51.809 --> 36:54.211
Too many fit birds here
for that to happen.

36:54.278 --> 36:57.815
Even Vicky was having a little flirt.
I was like, "Go on, Vic."

36:57.882 --> 37:00.251
"Are we flirting here?
What's going on?"

37:00.318 --> 37:01.986
Vicky would never happen.

37:02.053 --> 37:05.423
I'm mates with Ricci and it
wouldn't happen, I couldn't do it.

37:05.489 --> 37:09.293
I don't think Vicky would.
Nah, she definitely wouldn't.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.461
Def... Hmm.

37:10.528 --> 37:13.731
Would Charlotte be pissed off
if you necked on with Vicky?

37:13.798 --> 37:16.067
Cos you nearly did last night.
Did I fuck!

37:16.133 --> 37:18.569
You're smiling
cos you know I'm right.

37:18.636 --> 37:21.505
(laughs)
Don't deny it, kid.

37:21.572 --> 37:23.674
What happened? An innocent flirt.

37:25.009 --> 37:28.446
Innocent until proven guilty.
(laughs)

37:36.721 --> 37:41.225
If they want family time,
let's give them fucking family time,

37:41.292 --> 37:44.729
cos I can't be arsed with arguing.
I fucking hate arguing.

37:44.795 --> 37:46.263
Girls!

37:46.330 --> 37:49.266
What?
Come to the top floor of the garden.

37:49.333 --> 37:53.137
(Vicky) Ooh!
They've arranged the chairs.

37:53.204 --> 37:55.206
(whooping, laughter)

37:55.272 --> 37:58.809
Scott and Gaz have pulled out
all the stops tonight, mind.

37:58.876 --> 38:02.913
Set a few bean bags out
and ordered some pizzas. Get in.

38:10.888 --> 38:12.523
I just don't think we are.

38:12.590 --> 38:16.260
If Charlotte wants an argument,
I wish she'd walk up and have it,

38:16.327 --> 38:18.829
instead of trying to
turn everyone against us.

38:19.764 --> 38:23.100
Yeah, I do agree with that, Gary.
First time in a long time.

38:23.167 --> 38:26.103
I'm pleased yous are agreeing...
on something.

38:26.170 --> 38:29.740
It's gonna take more than a slice
of pizza for me to forgive them two.

38:29.807 --> 38:31.742
Let's just go out.
(Sophie) Yeah!

38:31.809 --> 38:33.511
(Vicky) To family!

38:40.918 --> 38:43.454
(shouting, whooping)

38:44.655 --> 38:48.025
Tonight is another family night,
we're hitting No Vacancy.

38:48.092 --> 38:51.328
I just hope it works out well
and we actually all get on.

38:58.269 --> 39:01.238
Me and Gaz seem to be getting on
so much better.

39:01.305 --> 39:04.108
I hope he's finally realised
that I'm not a mug,

39:04.175 --> 39:06.277
and he can't keep going on
the way he is.

39:09.647 --> 39:13.084
Fuck me! I'm actually having
a conversation with Charlotte,

39:13.150 --> 39:16.187
with no awkwardness,
and it actually feels real.

39:16.253 --> 39:18.723
This is what a family night
actually is.

39:22.493 --> 39:25.730
It annoys us how Gary thinks
that nothing's changed.

39:25.796 --> 39:27.498
He's not fazed by this at all.

39:27.565 --> 39:29.900
When, really,
I'm having to work so hard

39:29.967 --> 39:32.636
to not let him fuck up
yet another relationship.

39:42.213 --> 39:46.383
Finally Charlotte and Gary look like
they're a civilised conversation,

39:46.450 --> 39:49.754
and I hope Charlotte is
getting everything off her chest.

39:57.795 --> 40:00.531
It's weird that she's been
so far away and distant

40:00.598 --> 40:03.601
and all of a sudden
she's laughing and carrying on again.

40:03.667 --> 40:05.636
This is dangerous territory.

40:08.272 --> 40:10.040
We're proving a point here.

40:10.107 --> 40:12.810
We're all out together
having a good time.

40:22.787 --> 40:25.890
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!

40:25.956 --> 40:27.691
Sloppy Char!
Come on.

40:29.360 --> 40:32.396
Why is Gary fully naked?
(Sophie) Go on, Gary, lege.

40:32.463 --> 40:36.667
Gary's got a fanny!
(laughter)

40:38.435 --> 40:41.972
I know that's a mangina
and not the real thing.

40:42.039 --> 40:44.375
What the fuck?
This is dedicated to Jay.

40:44.441 --> 40:45.643
Jay, I love ya.

40:49.113 --> 40:51.482
Finally everyone's
speaking to each other

40:51.549 --> 40:53.417
and everyone's having a good time.

40:53.484 --> 40:56.420
This is fab because Joel's coming
in the next few hours.

40:56.487 --> 41:00.090
What do you think's gonna happen
with Charlotte when Joel comes?

41:00.157 --> 41:02.960
She gets a bit happy
and may want to leave more?

41:03.027 --> 41:05.896
I do think Charlotte
will get a little bit jealous

41:05.963 --> 41:08.499
when she sees
Sophie and Joel happy together,

41:08.566 --> 41:11.135
but it's only natural.
I will as well.

41:11.202 --> 41:14.438
She's so drunk.
I looked at her and I was like,

41:14.505 --> 41:17.575
"You're drinking wine,
this means one thing."

41:17.641 --> 41:21.579
"You're getting carried to bed,
you're probably gonna piss yourself

41:21.645 --> 41:22.880
and that's it."

41:22.947 --> 41:25.382
Do you know what, though?
She said tonight,

41:25.449 --> 41:28.686
"If I do leave, I just want to make
the most of what I do now."

41:28.752 --> 41:31.989
I would never want her to leave
but if that makes her happy,

41:32.056 --> 41:33.324
I just hope she's OK.

41:34.692 --> 41:38.062
I don't think people understand
that I've got to live here

41:38.128 --> 41:41.332
with someone who I used to be with,
an ex.

41:41.398 --> 41:44.535
This time around
it's totally different.

41:44.602 --> 41:47.037
I really, really, really miss Mitch

41:47.104 --> 41:50.541
and every day it seems like
it's just getting harder and harder.

41:50.608 --> 41:53.143
I don't know how much longer
I'll be able to do it.

42:11.929 --> 42:14.164
I feel as though
when Gary first found out

42:14.231 --> 42:16.500
Charlotte had a boyfriend,
he was happy.

42:16.567 --> 42:17.801
But as time progressed

42:17.868 --> 42:21.338
he realised just how much he missed
the relationship they had.

42:21.405 --> 42:24.775
And now he's, like, floundering
and sort of wants her back.

42:34.752 --> 42:36.620
It's the day Joel's gonna get here.

42:36.687 --> 42:40.090
(squeals)
(cheering) It's Joel!

42:40.157 --> 42:42.526
Fuck off.
Can you not see we're hung-over?

42:43.994 --> 42:45.829
She just looks like a big floater.

42:45.896 --> 42:48.599
We look like
two giant fucking Smurfs.

42:48.666 --> 42:49.900
What?! Where?!

42:49.967 --> 42:51.702
It's not funny. Ow!

42:51.769 --> 42:54.104
I'm here to give you
a special workout.

42:54.171 --> 42:57.608
Follow me.
He is fucking beautiful.

42:57.675 --> 43:01.345
Drinks, girls, music, dance.
This is just standard procedure.

43:03.681 --> 43:06.850
Scott's smashing the house up again.

43:06.917 --> 43:09.286
He was devastated
I had more girls than him.

43:09.353 --> 43:11.422
It's like a trailer park.
Wrong turn!

43:11.488 --> 43:13.324
I'm thinking, "I'm gonna die."

43:13.390 --> 43:15.626
Oh, my God!
(screaming)

43:40.551 --> 43:40.751
.
