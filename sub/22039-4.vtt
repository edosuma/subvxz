Turned out to be a front for
an international drug syndicate.

09:53.090 --> 09:54.929
What do you think of this, by the way?

09:54.930 --> 09:56.769
- Yeah, it's nice. Silk?
- I'm glad you asked, though...

09:56.770 --> 09:58.250
It's all silk.

09:58.251 --> 09:59.610
..about my new start,

09:59.611 --> 10:01.450
'cause I actually do
view it as an opportunity

10:01.451 --> 10:03.491
to kind of... reset.

10:03.492 --> 10:06.971
So in the medium-to-long term,
probably not the short term,

10:06.972 --> 10:09.652
I wanna become a flight attendant

10:09.653 --> 10:13.293
on Branson's Virgin Galactic
commercial spacecraft.

10:13.294 --> 10:15.053
- That's my plan.
- That's a big dream!

10:15.054 --> 10:17.013
- I know!
- That's impressive.

10:17.014 --> 10:19.094
- Shoot for the stars, girl.
- Yeah, literally!

10:19.095 --> 10:21.134
Yeah, yeah. And I've always loved space.

10:21.135 --> 10:23.775
I've just been fascinated
by that void, you know,

10:23.776 --> 10:27.015
being still and at one with
your thoughts and... you know.

10:27.016 --> 10:29.896
Let me say, before you embark
on what's obviously a big dream,

10:29.897 --> 10:32.857
um, it's pretty stupid and
it's never gonna happen.

10:32.858 --> 10:34.857
Well, I disagree.

10:34.858 --> 10:36.537
So I think it's really
important to dream.

10:36.538 --> 10:38.018
Well within your rights to disagree.

10:38.019 --> 10:39.498
It's important to have a dream,

10:39.499 --> 10:40.699
as long as you don't think

10:40.700 --> 10:42.298
it's actually gonna happen
because this clearly isn't.

10:42.299 --> 10:43.979
- Yes, it will.
- No, it's never gonna happen.

10:43.980 --> 10:45.779
And I'll tell you why.

10:45.780 --> 10:49.260
Firstly, um, it's been happening
'in the next year or so'

10:49.261 --> 10:51.060
for the past decade.

10:51.061 --> 10:53.861
His own mother is on the record
as saying it's not gonna happen.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.301
- She was a flight attendant.
- Well, that's a point.

10:56.302 --> 10:58.462
Have you done any... had any experience?

10:58.463 --> 11:00.702
No, but I always fly Virgin
whenever I get the chance.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.903
Okay, so there's perhaps 20,000 people

11:02.904 --> 11:04.783
who are perhaps better
qualified than yourself

11:04.784 --> 11:07.784
to fly in this mythical
intergalactic flight.

11:07.785 --> 11:09.904
That's the other thing about space.

11:09.905 --> 11:11.704
- Space is boring.
- Space is amazing!

11:11.705 --> 11:13.785
Space is an opportunity
to just be in the moment,

11:13.786 --> 11:15.585
be in the void with your thoughts.

11:15.586 --> 11:17.225
HENDY: Travelling in
space would be more like

11:17.226 --> 11:18.946

11:18.947 --> 11:20.706
at night with no windows.

11:20.707 --> 11:22.426
There's your space travel.

11:22.427 --> 11:24.187
Well, that's your opinion.

11:24.188 --> 11:26.507
You know, Hendy, give her a break.

11:26.508 --> 11:28.508
I'm trying to give her a break.

11:28.509 --> 11:30.868
Sure, it's an utterly ridiculous dream,
completely unachievable.

11:30.869 --> 11:33.509
By the time she gets there
she'll be an old chook.

11:33.510 --> 11:37.149
But, you know, it's important
to have these things.

11:37.150 --> 11:38.750
Long as she knows
she's probably better off

11:38.751 --> 11:40.230
staying on the streets.

11:40.231 --> 11:42.070
Well, familiar territory.

11:42.071 --> 11:43.551
She's been a hostess of sorts already.

11:43.552 --> 11:45.351
A hostess of the flesh.

11:45.352 --> 11:47.752
And she could move into the house.
The madame of the house.

11:47.753 --> 11:49.552

he's come out of the closet.

- He's 41.

12:05.236 --> 12:07.315
Yeah, right. No.

12:07.316 --> 12:09.116
What's wrong with that?

12:09.117 --> 12:11.916
I mean, the guy's had
an incredible career.

12:11.917 --> 12:13.797
Not even a real sport for a start.

12:13.798 --> 12:16.957
But if you do that when you're 22,
that takes balls, all right?

12:16.958 --> 12:19.598
If you do that when you're 82,
that takes balls, all right?

12:19.599 --> 12:20.797
What's the difference?

12:20.822 --> 12:22.799
There's a whole legacy behind you, mate.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.399
You've lied to your entire family

12:24.400 --> 12:26.679
and now you've gotta own up to it
before you die.

- As a footballer?
- As a gay man.

12:43.284 --> 12:45.163
As a gay prop forward.

12:45.164 --> 12:47.563
That'd take some guts.

12:47.564 --> 12:49.364
That would take some guts!

Imagine coming out with your lover
in State of Origin,

one playing for Queensland,
one playing for New South Wales.

balls would be to do that.
