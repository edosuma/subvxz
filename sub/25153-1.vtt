00:14.083 --> 00:15.953
Shall we add some blush?

00:16.082 --> 00:17.083
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM

00:20.792 --> 00:22.328
You're perfect!

00:22.458 --> 00:24.708
What more can we do with you?

00:49.750 --> 00:52.167
I'M NOT AN EASY MAN

01:02.458 --> 01:04.953
We have the dress but no princess.

01:05.083 --> 01:07.287
- Oh no!
- What do we do?

01:07.417 --> 01:09.333
Give it to someone else.

01:15.333 --> 01:16.578
Who wants to wear

01:16.708 --> 01:18.167
Snow White's costume?

01:18.458 --> 01:19.458
Me!

01:20.458 --> 01:21.537
<i>I was five.</i>

01:21.667 --> 01:25.537
<i>I was crazy about a girl
who'd never looked at me.</i>

01:25.667 --> 01:27.208
You saved us!

01:28.708 --> 01:31.083
<i>Finally I felt her eyes on me.</i>

01:33.917 --> 01:34.917
Go on.

01:35.875 --> 01:37.292
<i>It was amazing.</i>

02:01.833 --> 02:03.583
Her name was Aurora.

02:04.375 --> 02:05.875
I thought I'd die.

02:07.500 --> 02:08.958
But you didn't.

02:10.917 --> 02:12.583
What does it mean?

02:13.375 --> 02:14.875
Is love dangerous?

02:15.125 --> 02:17.287
No, I'm not afraid of women.

02:17.417 --> 02:21.125
That's not a problem. Women like me.

02:21.917 --> 02:23.453
So why are you here?

02:23.583 --> 02:25.042
I told you.

02:27.250 --> 02:29.458
I spend too long brushing my teeth.

02:29.667 --> 02:33.542
At first, it took me three minutes
like dentists recommend.

02:34.250 --> 02:37.167
Now it takes me half an hour.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.792
If I don't do it, I feel anxious.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Introducing...

02:54.792 --> 02:56.042
the "boner-o-meter"!

02:58.083 --> 03:01.620
A smartphone app that records
how often you have sex

03:01.750 --> 03:04.625
and lets you compare from year to year.

03:04.958 --> 03:07.745
We have a fun visual aid.

03:07.875 --> 03:10.078
Our guy's penis gets longer,

03:10.208 --> 03:13.458
the more sex he has.
Like Pinocchio's nose.

03:14.208 --> 03:17.037
One, two, three... 25 times.

03:17.167 --> 03:19.000
Now look here.

03:19.333 --> 03:23.417
There's a slight drop
but it's up again in 2016!

03:24.250 --> 03:25.833
What about women?

03:26.583 --> 03:27.625
Good question. Sophie?

03:27.958 --> 03:28.958
Right.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.662
Women are well-represented.

03:30.792 --> 03:32.125
We click on a tab

03:32.792 --> 03:35.620
to pull up their profile then hit select.

03:35.750 --> 03:37.245
Blonde, Asian,

03:37.375 --> 03:38.495
brunette...

03:38.625 --> 03:39.625
Is this a joke?

03:39.917 --> 03:41.500
Kind of.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.292
It's called humor.

03:43.542 --> 03:46.958
I could explain it better
over dinner tonight.

03:51.417 --> 03:52.453
It's great!

03:52.583 --> 03:53.583
I love it.

03:53.708 --> 03:56.953
It's fun, modern,
we can make a gay version.

03:57.083 --> 03:58.208
Jackpot!

04:00.167 --> 04:01.500
- A hit!
- Thanks, boss.

04:18.791 --> 04:21.375
- Care for a drink?
- That's a bit forward.

04:21.666 --> 04:24.917
No, Christophe Lamy
is signing his new book.

04:26.083 --> 04:27.083
The fat guy over there?

04:29.333 --> 04:30.333
Yes.

04:32.250 --> 04:33.583
Champagne? Orange juice?

04:34.125 --> 04:35.167
You're tall.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.083
Is it a problem?

04:37.917 --> 04:39.042
Champagne.

04:39.542 --> 04:42.458
What do you call
champagne and orange juice?

04:43.208 --> 04:44.078
A mimosa.

04:44.208 --> 04:45.287
Excuse me.

04:45.417 --> 04:47.958
Your mouth looks pretty when you say it.

04:48.917 --> 04:49.917
Say it again.

04:57.208 --> 04:58.208
Everything ok?

04:58.292 --> 05:00.703
Fine. I saw you hitting on him.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.083
Spare me!

05:02.417 --> 05:04.495
Did he bother you? It's not his style.

05:04.625 --> 05:05.625
You know him?

05:06.250 --> 05:07.250
Twenty years now.

05:07.458 --> 05:08.625
He's sweet.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.333
- Mimosa.
- Again.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.037
Navy suits you, Sybil.

05:18.167 --> 05:19.745
Makes you look serious.

05:19.875 --> 05:21.537
I came straight from work.

05:21.667 --> 05:23.578
What do you do? I always forget.

05:23.708 --> 05:24.912
- I'm a lawyer.
- Excuse me.

05:25.042 --> 05:26.078
Come here.

05:26.208 --> 05:27.625
Don't turn round.

05:28.042 --> 05:30.370
Tall brunette, hot lips.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.537
Dream on, she's gotta be gay.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.287
Who is she?

05:34.417 --> 05:37.000
Alexandra, my assistant. A nightmare.

05:37.583 --> 05:38.745
Damien!

05:38.875 --> 05:40.333
Princess!

05:41.292 --> 05:42.620
How are you?

05:42.750 --> 05:43.750
Where were you?

05:43.792 --> 05:46.203
Susan's ballet audition. We had to go.

05:46.333 --> 05:48.370
What about my book launch?

05:48.500 --> 05:50.292
The world keeps turning.

05:50.667 --> 05:53.745
What now? I'm hungry. Can we come over?

05:53.875 --> 05:55.162
Good idea!

05:55.292 --> 05:58.750
Not on a school night. I got lots to do.

05:59.083 --> 06:00.917
Lolo, be a sport.

06:01.292 --> 06:02.625
He's a scream.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.620
You have no clue.

06:04.750 --> 06:07.208
You only have yourself to think of.

06:07.542 --> 06:10.167
It's fun to come over all the time,

06:11.042 --> 06:16.417
but it means after work
I have to shop, cook and do the dishes.

06:16.625 --> 06:18.208
We clear the table.

06:18.750 --> 06:20.000
How kind of you.

06:20.250 --> 06:23.203
But it'd be nice to swap roles
on my birthday.

06:23.333 --> 06:24.912
Great idea!

06:25.042 --> 06:26.250
When is it?

06:27.917 --> 06:29.208
Ask Christophe.

06:29.875 --> 06:31.620
Come on, kids. Sybil?

06:31.750 --> 06:34.245
- Is it today?
- I'm in deep shit.

06:34.375 --> 06:36.370
Come on, for chrissakes.

06:36.500 --> 06:37.500
Get on it!

06:37.625 --> 06:40.078
Let's find a flower shop.

06:40.208 --> 06:41.208
She's a pain.

06:41.458 --> 06:42.912
You can go, Alexandra.

06:43.042 --> 06:45.000
See you tomorrow. Congrats again!

06:46.208 --> 06:47.958
And when will I see you?

06:49.167 --> 06:50.458
In another life.

06:58.542 --> 07:01.162
Deny it. Does she know you cheated?

07:01.292 --> 07:03.958
- No.
- Deny it! She has no proof.

07:04.500 --> 07:05.750
- Hi Erica.
- Hey Damien.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.453
Time for a quick drink?

07:07.583 --> 07:08.750
Don't tempt me,

07:09.208 --> 07:10.292
naughty girl!

07:17.500 --> 07:18.328
Damien?

07:18.458 --> 07:19.667
Buddy?

07:22.125 --> 07:23.625
FATHER LACHAISE CEMETERY

07:36.250 --> 07:37.912
The ambulance is coming.

07:38.042 --> 07:39.453
Can you see me?

07:39.583 --> 07:40.667
I'm here.

07:41.875 --> 07:44.000
MOTHER LACHAISE CEMETERY

07:45.792 --> 07:46.875
Step aside, young man.

07:48.958 --> 07:50.792
Can you hear me?

07:51.625 --> 07:52.453
Yes.

07:52.583 --> 07:54.375
Open your eyes wide.

07:55.000 --> 07:55.870
You're pretty.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.203
What happened?

07:57.333 --> 07:59.370
Two women were following us.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.078
We started to run and he hit the post.

08:02.208 --> 08:03.328
I was so scared.

08:03.458 --> 08:05.583
- How old are you?
- Mind your manners!

08:06.292 --> 08:08.495
Are you hurt? Have you been drinking?

08:08.625 --> 08:10.078
Do mimosas count?

08:10.208 --> 08:11.037
Stop it!

08:11.167 --> 08:12.787
Are you on any medication?

08:12.917 --> 08:13.745
The pill, right?

08:13.875 --> 08:16.750
Cut the crap, Christophe! Forgive him.

08:17.042 --> 08:18.167
I'm fine.

08:18.625 --> 08:19.917
I'm going to go home.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.667
How far is it?

08:21.917 --> 08:23.417
A few blocks. How about you?

08:25.083 --> 08:26.708
Lean on me.

08:27.042 --> 08:28.417
I'll be fine, thanks.

08:30.125 --> 08:31.412
Thanks, ladies.

08:31.542 --> 08:32.832
Goodbye, gentlemen.

08:34.417 --> 08:36.457
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.125
You really scared me.

08:40.875 --> 08:41.912
Enjoying your stroll?

08:42.042 --> 08:43.787
Are you going out without us?

08:43.917 --> 08:46.292
I ordered pizza,
the kids are waiting for you.

08:46.792 --> 08:47.792
See you later.

08:49.917 --> 08:52.120
Sybil's cute, isn't she?

08:52.250 --> 08:55.828
She's not real brawny
but she's got something.

08:55.958 --> 08:57.167
A good catch.

08:57.458 --> 08:59.037
I'm not talking marriage!

08:59.167 --> 09:01.042
These jeans are too tight.

09:01.625 --> 09:04.953
Have I put on weight? Maybe they shrunk.

09:05.083 --> 09:06.750
You wearing a push-up?

09:07.458 --> 09:09.375
If your balls sag get 'em done.

09:09.708 --> 09:11.083
You're nuts!

09:13.167 --> 09:15.958
Yeah, it shows when they're fake.

09:18.250 --> 09:19.250
I'm cold.

09:19.333 --> 09:20.958
How much did we drink?

09:22.250 --> 09:23.833
Take my scarf.

09:33.833 --> 09:35.292
Call if you need me.

09:40.583 --> 09:41.912
Lift the seat, Susan!

09:42.042 --> 09:46.083
Dad, can you teach Susan
not to pee on the seat?

09:46.958 --> 09:49.000
Did you do your homework?

09:50.917 --> 09:55.208
Come here, Rocco. Who's Daddy's boy?

10:06.583 --> 10:08.167
<i>Quit teasing me!</i>

10:10.958 --> 10:14.333
<i>Your Wonderpants are driving me crazy.</i>

10:19.500 --> 10:22.620
<i>After several accounts by men
were published</i>

10:22.750 --> 10:24.453
<i>by our fellow newswomen,</i>

10:24.583 --> 10:29.412
<i>many politicians have called
for the Paris deputess to step down.</i>

10:29.542 --> 10:32.828
<i>People are speaking out
and we expect to hear more.</i>

10:32.958 --> 10:36.167
<i>The question is, why now?</i>

11:03.167 --> 11:04.625
What the hell?

11:07.458 --> 11:09.083
What are these clothes?

11:10.417 --> 11:12.042
Who put these here?

11:15.542 --> 11:18.083
That crazy Danish bitch?

11:20.750 --> 11:22.333
Where are my jeans?

11:24.583 --> 11:25.583
Fuck.

11:29.042 --> 11:30.167
Grey sweatpants.

11:31.333 --> 11:32.708
And a white T-shirt.

11:33.625 --> 11:34.625
Morning.

11:35.083 --> 11:36.083
Morning!

11:36.167 --> 11:37.375
Nice smile.

11:37.542 --> 11:38.583
Hotty.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.495
Hey! Where's Gladys?

11:47.625 --> 11:49.287
Hi Damien. In her office.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.208
Her office?

11:51.958 --> 11:53.995
Your top's a little see-through.

11:54.125 --> 11:56.745
- Does it turn you on?
- I'm not the problem.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.375
- Stop.
- Hi.

11:58.875 --> 11:59.875
Hey.

12:02.875 --> 12:04.375
Good morning!

12:08.708 --> 12:09.578
I see.

12:09.708 --> 12:12.708
Lots of gals in the office today.

12:13.708 --> 12:15.828
- Where are the men?
- We do our best.

12:15.958 --> 12:17.083
We need to talk.

12:17.667 --> 12:19.625
Nice T-shirt. Sexy.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.750
- I'm all yours.
- After you.

12:25.208 --> 12:27.958
I'll be blunt, I didn't pick your project.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.292
Have a seat.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.412
You did a great job.

12:36.542 --> 12:38.667
It's clever, maybe too much so.

12:39.083 --> 12:40.708
Is that what Marco said?

12:41.125 --> 12:42.125
Marco?

12:42.375 --> 12:44.292
I'm sorry, how rude. Coffee?

12:45.000 --> 12:46.662
Marco, two coffees please.

12:46.792 --> 12:48.912
Come on, Sophie, that's enough.

12:49.042 --> 12:50.708
Be realistic, Damien.

12:50.958 --> 12:53.620
The client prefers a more feminine humor,

12:53.750 --> 12:56.245
cruder but to the point.

12:56.375 --> 12:57.833
Yours is too delicate.

12:58.083 --> 13:00.583
It makes sense for a woman to get the gig.

13:02.333 --> 13:03.958
Super plus. I'm a heavy bleeder.

13:10.375 --> 13:11.875
You know I like you a lot.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.375
I like you too, more than you think.

13:17.208 --> 13:20.500
It wouldn't take much
to climb a rung or two.

13:26.458 --> 13:30.370
Fabienne's idea is great
because it's fun, it's modern,

13:30.500 --> 13:33.083
we can make a lesbian version. It's a hit!

13:36.708 --> 13:38.708
- You ok, Marco?
- Fine, and you?

13:38.875 --> 13:41.495
Lunch later? I brought my quinoa salad.

13:41.625 --> 13:43.333
Can I see what you chose?

13:46.542 --> 13:47.542
Here.

13:49.208 --> 13:50.375
"Vulv-o-meter"?

13:50.750 --> 13:52.875
No, you can't do this!

13:53.375 --> 13:55.333
- It's disgusting!
- See you later.

13:58.250 --> 13:59.250
I...

14:00.458 --> 14:02.042
Whatever you're playing at,

14:03.208 --> 14:04.703
you're gonna regret it.

14:04.833 --> 14:06.667
Sweetie, here's some advice.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.537
Take a few days off.

14:08.667 --> 14:11.703
You're overworked,
take some time for yourself.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.787
Go out, see pals, have a spa day,

14:13.917 --> 14:17.703
or else stay home with your cat,
just get it together.

14:17.833 --> 14:19.292
Will you shut up?

14:20.667 --> 14:21.917
It's my project.

14:22.625 --> 14:24.917
You hear me? Stop messing with me.

14:29.125 --> 14:31.083
Get out and don't come back.

14:32.167 --> 14:33.208
Nutcase.

14:33.750 --> 14:35.000
Dickhead.

14:41.875 --> 14:43.203
A beer, please.

14:43.333 --> 14:44.625
Good morning, sir.

14:54.042 --> 14:55.917
Ma'am? We'd like to order.

14:59.125 --> 15:00.912
May we order, please?

15:01.042 --> 15:02.292
I don't get veiled men.

15:04.792 --> 15:06.875
Why? What have we done?

15:07.333 --> 15:09.708
We're here for coffee, what's wrong?

15:11.875 --> 15:13.542
I say what I like.

15:13.708 --> 15:16.208
This is my place. I do what I want.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.708
It's always the same.

15:19.250 --> 15:22.078
Whether it's headscarves or short pants,

15:22.208 --> 15:23.458
men always get blamed.

15:23.875 --> 15:25.667
Women are never at fault!

15:26.458 --> 15:27.458
Isn't that true?

16:10.417 --> 16:11.870
Dad? Mom?

16:12.000 --> 16:14.583
Hello bunny! You look down.

16:15.083 --> 16:16.667
You got a hangdog look.

16:19.417 --> 16:20.583
Here we are.

16:22.042 --> 16:23.620
That's twenty.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.245
Here's ten and two makes twenty.

16:26.375 --> 16:27.828
Thank you, Mr. Fernandez.

16:27.958 --> 16:28.958
How's your dad?

16:29.042 --> 16:32.875
He's like you, never slacks off.
Still doing his nails.

16:33.417 --> 16:35.292
Details count!

16:36.708 --> 16:39.333
- See you next time.
- Goodbye Mr. Fernandez.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Are you having trouble at work, kitten?

16:44.167 --> 16:46.375
If only you had someone to lean on.

16:47.417 --> 16:49.078
Don't start again!

16:49.208 --> 16:51.167
I'd like to have grandkids.

16:53.958 --> 16:55.453
What did I say?

16:55.583 --> 16:58.370
You read the neurologist's report,

16:58.500 --> 17:00.245
he says the scan was clear.

17:00.375 --> 17:02.458
I don't need to see your X-rays.

17:03.833 --> 17:05.328
Something's wrong.

17:05.458 --> 17:10.166
Two guys thrown out of a bar
because of their headscarves!

17:11.375 --> 17:12.537
The world is insane!

17:12.666 --> 17:14.666
Or I've fallen into a black hole.

17:15.125 --> 17:16.500
A parallel universe.

17:16.875 --> 17:18.833
- You think so?
- Am I nuts?

17:19.625 --> 17:21.619
You seem entirely lucid.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.994
If I ask who our president is,

17:25.125 --> 17:26.244
you can tell me her name.

17:26.375 --> 17:30.000
But if you couldn't,
I'd refer you to a psychiatrist

17:30.792 --> 17:34.583
or have you committed.
But that doesn't seem necessary.

17:42.250 --> 17:43.333
Watch out!

18:03.833 --> 18:05.833
MOTHER LACHAISE CEMETERY

18:34.125 --> 18:35.250
Hi Sybil.

18:38.667 --> 18:40.250
I'm fine and you?

18:40.917 --> 18:43.000
<i>Want to grab a drink tonight?</i>

18:43.958 --> 18:45.250
Tonight?

19:01.792 --> 19:03.370
It's not what I thought.

19:03.500 --> 19:07.370
The gals at work said it was perfect
but they pulled a prank on me.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.287
It's ok, no worries!

19:09.417 --> 19:10.792
I love...

19:12.792 --> 19:13.620
Oh boy.

19:13.750 --> 19:15.125
I didn't notice...

19:16.833 --> 19:19.458
If you're uncomfortable we can leave.

19:20.083 --> 19:21.625
It's ok.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.328
You're rocking the lumberjane look.

19:24.458 --> 19:26.125
Yep, I'm into plaid.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.083
Wait, don't be scared.

19:29.625 --> 19:30.625
There.

19:31.167 --> 19:33.458
What'll you have? Champagne?

19:34.417 --> 19:36.620
Nah, gives me heartburn.

19:36.750 --> 19:37.578
What?

19:37.708 --> 19:40.745
White gives me heartburn.
I'll have a beer.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.875
So much for the beer gut!

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Sorry.

19:49.375 --> 19:51.083
You've got a lovely smile.

19:52.542 --> 19:54.625
- Really?
- No one's told you before?

19:55.125 --> 19:57.542
No, but thanks.

19:58.875 --> 20:00.375
Are you on something?

20:00.958 --> 20:02.333
Maybe.

20:03.875 --> 20:05.667
High on shrooms?

20:06.583 --> 20:07.958
Sorry.

20:13.167 --> 20:14.500
I'm sorry.

20:22.125 --> 20:24.662
He left me because I didn't want kids

20:24.792 --> 20:28.042
and his biological clock was ticking.

20:30.583 --> 20:31.583
You got kids?

20:31.917 --> 20:32.917
No.

20:32.958 --> 20:34.370
Not too painful?

20:34.500 --> 20:36.417
It's a choice or else I would.

20:38.083 --> 20:41.125
Guys like you are brave.

21:00.167 --> 21:02.333
- Where's the light?
- There.

21:07.667 --> 21:08.995
Sorry, I can't.

21:09.125 --> 21:10.292
Why?

21:10.750 --> 21:12.750
You look like a monkey!

21:13.333 --> 21:14.458
So what?

21:16.042 --> 21:18.042
I can't touch you.

21:18.875 --> 21:19.953
Sibyl, come on.

21:20.083 --> 21:21.792
Test your boundaries.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.120
It's just dirty.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.370
Close your eyes.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.500
Listen.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.125
I'm a monkey!

21:36.042 --> 21:39.500
It's a forward pass! Throw her the ball!

21:40.250 --> 21:43.162
Can I have some cash?
I need deodorant pads.

21:43.292 --> 21:44.995
Dad deals with boys' stuff.

21:45.125 --> 21:46.787
It's just nature.

21:46.917 --> 21:48.750
Use mine, I'll buy more.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.042
Bye, Damien.

21:52.667 --> 21:54.875
- I'm off to ballet.
- Bye!

21:57.042 --> 21:59.083
Maybe your hormones are off.

21:59.583 --> 22:01.203
You're nervous, losing hair,

22:01.333 --> 22:03.042
you need to do something.

22:03.667 --> 22:05.953
It takes work to look good.

22:06.083 --> 22:09.917
What happened yesterday
was a wake-up call.

22:10.375 --> 22:11.542
We're older now.

22:12.375 --> 22:13.912
We used to be sexy

22:14.042 --> 22:15.495
in jeans and a T-shirt,

22:15.625 --> 22:17.167
but now it's not enough.

22:17.542 --> 22:20.370
What'd you decide about your job?

22:20.500 --> 22:22.042
Where's the damn referee?

22:23.250 --> 22:25.375
That's a foul! Give her a red card!

22:25.917 --> 22:28.000
Your cupcakes are killer, hon.

22:28.417 --> 22:30.792
Please eat them, otherwise I will.

22:31.375 --> 22:33.245
Fired for gross misconduct,

22:33.375 --> 22:34.578
they'll eat you alive.

22:34.708 --> 22:36.328
Lolo and I talked.

22:36.458 --> 22:38.125
Dear, tell him his options.

22:38.792 --> 22:41.625
You can sue them. But it'll take forever.

22:42.292 --> 22:46.287
You should enlist the support
of a masculist group

22:46.417 --> 22:49.120
that fights discrimination
against men at work.

22:49.250 --> 22:51.828
Those English bitches are offside!

22:51.958 --> 22:53.250
Look at that!

22:53.750 --> 22:54.750
Watch this.

22:54.792 --> 22:55.875
On her own!

22:56.333 --> 22:58.287
Fantastic!

22:58.417 --> 23:00.037
I'm weeping for joy.

23:00.167 --> 23:01.708
Come on, sweetie... Try!

23:03.792 --> 23:04.620
Beautiful!

23:04.750 --> 23:06.792
Lolo! You're peeing!

23:07.917 --> 23:09.958
My water broke. Where's the car keys?

23:10.208 --> 23:12.542
- Shouldn't I drive?
- I'm not made of glass.

23:16.708 --> 23:18.917
Take a deep breath and push.

23:20.667 --> 23:21.917
Now stop.

23:22.625 --> 23:25.208
Let the shoulders through...

23:36.000 --> 23:38.787
I'm sorry, it happened early

23:38.917 --> 23:40.745
or I'd have planned ahead.

23:40.875 --> 23:42.083
It's his boss.

23:43.708 --> 23:44.578
What's up?

23:44.708 --> 23:46.578
His paternity leave is starting.

23:46.708 --> 23:48.375
- She's in a jam.
- Who?

23:48.792 --> 23:49.833
Alexandra.

23:54.708 --> 23:56.375
Alexandra Lamour, who else?

23:57.417 --> 23:58.417
Right!

23:58.958 --> 23:59.828
Of course.

23:59.958 --> 24:04.250
I'll brief whoever you choose.

24:04.708 --> 24:06.417
I dunno, we'll find someone.

24:13.083 --> 24:14.250
Not a bad idea.

24:15.375 --> 24:16.833
Happy to help out.

24:19.667 --> 24:21.292
I may have a solution.

26:10.542 --> 26:11.708
It's open!

26:17.167 --> 26:18.167
Come in.

26:18.250 --> 26:20.417
Take your shoes off first.

26:20.750 --> 26:22.417
Sure. Sorry.

26:26.292 --> 26:29.125
Navy suits you, makes you look serious.

26:30.875 --> 26:32.667
Come here, Fabien. Don't be shy.

26:35.500 --> 26:36.667
Damien.

26:39.167 --> 26:40.500
You're tall.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.208
Is it a problem?

26:42.250 --> 26:44.792
No, it's fine.

26:47.000 --> 26:47.870
What's that?

26:48.000 --> 26:50.620
Ziggy. She's my chameleon.

26:50.750 --> 26:51.750
Watch,

26:51.792 --> 26:54.083
she's gonna devour her guest.

27:00.292 --> 27:01.292
What's wrong?

27:02.042 --> 27:04.953
Are my abs distracting you?

27:05.083 --> 27:06.792
Go ahead. Hard as iron.

27:10.583 --> 27:11.583
Harder.

27:12.250 --> 27:13.833
- I'll hurt you.
- Doubt it.

27:15.958 --> 27:16.958
Ok.

27:18.083 --> 27:19.703
I'm in a rush this morning.

27:19.833 --> 27:20.833
A couple of things.

27:20.917 --> 27:24.125
Coffee? No, you make it while I get ready.

27:24.458 --> 27:25.542
I like it strong.

27:27.208 --> 27:29.625
I like you strong.

27:40.792 --> 27:42.625
That's Mollino's car!

27:43.375 --> 27:45.208
How do you know?

27:45.417 --> 27:48.245
The shape. It's a knockout.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.500
I drove it.

27:50.083 --> 27:51.958
- The Nardi Bisiluro?
- The one.

27:52.667 --> 27:54.995
- Giannini engine.
- 735 cc.

27:55.125 --> 27:56.745
- 62 hp.
- 7000 rpm.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.953
- 990 pounds.
- 24 hours of Le Mans...

27:59.083 --> 28:00.500
1955.

28:04.292 --> 28:07.662
Alright. Your desk is here.

28:07.792 --> 28:09.787
That one's mine, hands off.

28:09.917 --> 28:11.875
I'll give you a to-do list.

28:12.333 --> 28:14.495
It's boring but it'll save my life.

28:14.625 --> 28:15.750
I love Post-Its.

28:17.917 --> 28:20.995
You'll meet Mr. Martel, my housekeeper.

28:21.125 --> 28:23.000
I do my writing elsewhere.

28:23.250 --> 28:25.370
I won't see you today?

28:25.500 --> 28:26.875
Be a good boy.

28:27.792 --> 28:29.375
Can I ask what you're writing?

28:29.583 --> 28:30.583
No.

28:31.042 --> 28:32.167
You can't.

28:48.667 --> 28:52.667
<i>Of Mice and Women</i>, Jane Steinbeck
<i>Mister Bovary</i>, Georgia Flaubert

29:56.292 --> 29:57.708
Have you read her books?

29:58.333 --> 29:59.375
Nope.

29:59.542 --> 30:00.875
You should.

30:01.458 --> 30:04.750
Not because they're bestsellers.
I'm not like that.

30:05.083 --> 30:08.625
Her stories carry me away.

30:09.667 --> 30:12.167
You can tell a woman wrote them.
So powerful.

30:13.167 --> 30:15.125
Because a woman wrote them?

30:16.417 --> 30:18.333
Why'd I say that? It's dumb.

30:18.792 --> 30:19.958
It is.

30:20.458 --> 30:23.328
I mean they're not sentimental.

30:23.458 --> 30:27.000
There's lots of suspense... I love them!

30:29.167 --> 30:32.162
Hello, I'd like to book
a table for Ms. Lamour

30:32.292 --> 30:34.167
tomorrow evening, for two.

30:35.542 --> 30:38.583
If it's nicer by the patio, sure.

30:40.083 --> 30:41.625
Who's she dining with?

30:44.208 --> 30:47.083
I don't keep a record. I couldn't keep up!

31:03.833 --> 31:05.000
Want a hand?

31:06.208 --> 31:07.958
No thanks, I'm almost there.

31:09.083 --> 31:11.912
Give me that.
You'll hurt that pretty back.

31:12.042 --> 31:14.500
- Did you check me out?
- I did.

31:15.042 --> 31:17.120
I'm only trying to help.

31:17.250 --> 31:18.250
Come on!

31:18.542 --> 31:21.620
No, it's ok. Actually, I've had enough.

31:21.750 --> 31:23.453
I did everything on the list.

31:23.583 --> 31:26.167
There's your water, here are your keys...

31:27.542 --> 31:30.083
- What do you mean?
- Let's be honest.

31:30.708 --> 31:32.578
I'm not cut out for the job.

31:32.708 --> 31:34.662
What's wrong? You're edgy.

31:34.792 --> 31:36.125
Are you burned out?

31:36.583 --> 31:39.125
You really want to know what's wrong?

31:39.417 --> 31:40.417
I don't belong here.

31:40.458 --> 31:42.792
I woke up one morning in a crazy world

31:43.125 --> 31:45.708
where women tell me what to do.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.953
Spare me the masculist babble!

31:49.083 --> 31:51.250
You don't get it! How can I explain?

31:52.542 --> 31:55.870
Imagine a world where women
dress up to please me.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.333
Sometimes I even whistle at them
if they're sexy.

31:59.750 --> 32:00.828
How awful!

32:00.958 --> 32:02.037
You mean wonderful!

32:02.167 --> 32:05.203
A world where I'm no one's secretary,

32:05.333 --> 32:08.620
I design apps
for a mobile marketing agency.

32:08.750 --> 32:09.912
I'm an engineer.

32:10.042 --> 32:12.625
My boss thinks I'm a genius.

32:13.375 --> 32:15.662
I apologize.

32:15.792 --> 32:19.328
I completely forgot
to ask for your résumé.

32:19.458 --> 32:22.500
But it's your fault, you distracted me.

32:23.208 --> 32:25.917
With a fat-ass like Christophe,

32:26.375 --> 32:27.750
I kept a cool head.

32:28.333 --> 32:29.583
You're a lost cause.

32:30.167 --> 32:33.370
Don't get in a huff.
I'll take you for a spin.

32:33.500 --> 32:34.953
This baby's not so bad.

32:35.083 --> 32:37.162
I don't give a shit about your car!

32:37.292 --> 32:38.958
Do you think I'm impressed?

32:39.542 --> 32:41.917
Besides, alloy wheels are for hicks!

32:54.625 --> 32:57.833
I need you to punch my train ticket

33:04.667 --> 33:06.667
Do you feel it?

33:07.625 --> 33:08.625
What?

33:09.958 --> 33:10.958
Take this!

33:18.375 --> 33:19.375
Are you ok?

33:25.208 --> 33:26.792
We're not done.

33:34.458 --> 33:35.958
That's going too far.

33:39.208 --> 33:40.250
What the hell?

33:41.750 --> 33:43.703
- What?
- What was that?

33:43.833 --> 33:45.995
Rocco, my cat.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.370
He doesn't like people in my bed.

33:48.500 --> 33:50.203
Can you leave, please?

33:50.333 --> 33:52.333
Ouch, that hurts!

33:58.917 --> 34:00.375
You were wild today.

34:07.708 --> 34:09.333
Back among the living?

34:14.250 --> 34:15.625
That's too much.

34:16.125 --> 34:17.458
You're worth it.

34:18.500 --> 34:20.870
- Did you get your advance?
- Soon.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.458
Big shot.

34:22.625 --> 34:25.078
How can you spend what you don't have?

34:25.208 --> 34:27.333
I borrow, here and there.

34:28.458 --> 34:32.333
Watch out, one day
you'll get your face smashed in.

34:32.875 --> 34:34.708
Shall I order take-out?

34:35.958 --> 34:36.958
No.

34:39.417 --> 34:41.042
A client's waiting.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.411
Don't forget this.

34:43.542 --> 34:45.120
It's not mine.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.458
I don't leave my toothbrush here.

35:49.708 --> 35:53.333
Annabelle fucked all of Paris
without any pleasure.

35:56.875 --> 35:59.708
Annabelle fucked all of Paris.

37:11.208 --> 37:13.333
I'M NOT AN EASY MAN

37:18.917 --> 37:20.953
Not sure it's my thing.

37:21.083 --> 37:21.912
Me neither.

37:22.042 --> 37:25.912
When Lolo talked about Tits for Tat,
I thought it was a sex shop.

37:26.042 --> 37:27.625
TITS FOR TAT!

37:30.167 --> 37:33.042
Good morning! I'm Christophe.

37:33.208 --> 37:37.375
There's as much sexism
in young start-ups as anywhere else.

37:37.667 --> 37:39.995
It's more ambiguous and subtle

37:40.125 --> 37:42.370
but sadly, I've heard it all before.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.500
We'll do what we can for you.

37:44.792 --> 37:47.708
But Tits for Tat
is really an action group.

37:48.417 --> 37:51.495
We wear our boobs
at female-dominated events.

37:51.625 --> 37:53.875
Board meetings, the Medical Association,

37:54.083 --> 37:56.162
festivals. And we act like them.

37:56.292 --> 37:58.125
The more the merrier.

37:58.292 --> 38:00.828
It's an exchange. Like sex.

38:00.958 --> 38:02.417
I see.

38:03.125 --> 38:04.167
Give and take.

38:05.542 --> 38:07.917
There's three of us. Two plus one.

38:08.833 --> 38:10.042
She's the future too.

38:10.792 --> 38:12.125
That's sweet.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.328
Yep.

38:15.458 --> 38:16.500
<i>My shoulders?</i>

38:20.083 --> 38:21.292
<i>Do you like them?</i>

38:23.333 --> 38:24.333
<i>Yes.</i>

38:27.042 --> 38:28.708
<i>They aren't round enough.</i>

38:31.125 --> 38:33.620
I'm not sure where the bowl goes!

38:33.750 --> 38:36.417
- I'll leave it out!
- Thanks, Dad.

38:37.542 --> 38:40.995
It was nice to have us over.

38:41.125 --> 38:43.625
You must have better things to do.

38:46.500 --> 38:48.833
Maybe I'm a little psychic.

38:49.625 --> 38:52.287
See who it is, don't mind us.

38:52.417 --> 38:54.500
Maybe a girl asking you out.

38:56.042 --> 38:59.542
You need to get out there
to meet your soulmate.

39:00.792 --> 39:02.458
Aren't you seeing anyone?

39:06.833 --> 39:09.625
<i>And my nipples? Do you like them?</i>

39:10.875 --> 39:13.583
You never introduce us to anyone.

39:14.583 --> 39:15.875
I don't get it.

39:16.667 --> 39:19.037
You're adorable, you look young,

39:19.167 --> 39:22.042
you don't plan to just live with your cat.

39:22.333 --> 39:23.453
There must be one woman...

39:23.583 --> 39:25.328
What don't you get?

39:25.458 --> 39:29.120
There's not one woman, there are 3,000!

39:29.250 --> 39:31.662
I use more condoms than anyone in Paris,

39:31.792 --> 39:34.620
in case you're worried.
You've never met anyone

39:34.750 --> 39:37.625
because I can't even remember their names!

39:38.000 --> 39:41.078
"11 p.m. at the Normandy hotel bar."

39:41.208 --> 39:43.037
I don't even know who she is!

39:43.167 --> 39:45.328
I churn 'em out like sausages!

39:45.458 --> 39:49.542
What's the big fucking deal
about being a single man?

39:50.500 --> 39:53.042
It takes time to make good sausages.

39:59.417 --> 40:00.245
Bar, please?

40:00.375 --> 40:01.750
In the back.

40:10.667 --> 40:12.370
Lumberjane's back.

40:12.500 --> 40:15.162
- I saw him.
- Not bad, but...

40:15.292 --> 40:17.042
He made it!

40:19.208 --> 40:20.953
Yesterday wasn't enough?

40:21.083 --> 40:22.750
Wasn't I clear?

40:23.000 --> 40:25.620
You made yourself very clear,

40:25.750 --> 40:28.703
and I don't intend
to offer you work again.

40:28.833 --> 40:29.833
Champagne?

40:30.792 --> 40:32.042
Brut or rosé?

40:32.417 --> 40:35.208
Gentlemen prefer rosé.

40:35.667 --> 40:36.667
Brut.

40:40.250 --> 40:41.375
Same.

40:42.917 --> 40:44.917
What do you call
champagne and orange juice?

40:47.375 --> 40:48.625
A mimosa.

40:52.833 --> 40:55.667
I thought about your alternate world.

40:56.208 --> 40:58.000
It got me thinking.

40:58.500 --> 40:59.500
Did it?

41:00.917 --> 41:03.162
It's not so bad for women in your world.

41:03.292 --> 41:04.787
They get gifts,

41:04.917 --> 41:06.162
doors are held open.

41:06.292 --> 41:07.292
You're kidding.

41:07.375 --> 41:08.458
No, why?

41:09.833 --> 41:12.250
Of course, you wouldn't know.

41:12.750 --> 41:15.953
You were so manly before,
now you're like a girl.

41:16.083 --> 41:17.495
I forgot my garter belt.

41:17.625 --> 41:19.787
Do you ever stop? It must be exhausting.

41:19.917 --> 41:21.703
Do you ever forget you're a woman?

41:21.833 --> 41:24.125
- I'm not obsessed with it.
- Liar.

41:24.750 --> 41:28.500
When you wake up, piss, shower,
do your boxing,

41:29.125 --> 41:32.167
when you sign books for your fans,

41:32.750 --> 41:34.917
when you ogle a guy in the street,

41:35.125 --> 41:38.000
his legs, his neck, his ass,

41:38.833 --> 41:41.042
when you bed him, make him come,

41:42.417 --> 41:44.583
do you forget who does all that?

41:48.375 --> 41:51.078
Feminine psychology
isn't your strong point.

41:51.208 --> 41:52.792
We're the same, Alexandra.

41:53.250 --> 41:55.750
I make dates in hotel bars too.

41:56.750 --> 41:58.333
Are the rooms comfy?

42:03.917 --> 42:04.917
So then,

42:05.792 --> 42:08.453
if I understand, in your world,

42:08.583 --> 42:11.750
women fight to split the housework?

42:12.958 --> 42:15.833
What's a male condom like?
Small and tight?

42:16.042 --> 42:18.667
Very easy to put on. Wanna see?

42:19.042 --> 42:22.662
The female ones
have never caught on for us.

42:22.792 --> 42:26.833
Did they repave the road
after your UFO landed?

42:27.208 --> 42:29.875
You think I'm drunk? I am.

42:30.833 --> 42:33.542
But if you tease me, I'll shut up.

42:33.792 --> 42:37.245
You make me feel alive.
I could listen to you for hours.

42:37.375 --> 42:38.412
Really?

42:38.542 --> 42:39.578
What?

42:39.708 --> 42:41.250
- Can't I kiss you?
- No.

42:41.875 --> 42:45.245
You're going to take a nice cab home.

42:45.375 --> 42:46.750
Don't you like me?

42:48.417 --> 42:50.078
You're delightful,

42:50.208 --> 42:52.703
but I never take advantage of a drunk boy.

42:52.833 --> 42:54.875
What's that? Gallantry?

42:55.542 --> 42:58.495
Call it what you like: manners, courtesy.

42:58.625 --> 43:00.208
You'll thank me tomorrow.

43:00.625 --> 43:04.250
Don't you get it? No kiss, your miss.

43:06.083 --> 43:08.078
- Come on.
- Don't be a prude.

43:08.208 --> 43:10.208
You're gorgeous and you know it.

43:10.833 --> 43:12.667
Next time, no whisky for you.

43:14.250 --> 43:17.120
There is no next time. Didn't you hear me?

43:17.250 --> 43:19.292
Take it or leave it. So?

43:19.667 --> 43:20.828
So goodnight.

43:20.958 --> 43:24.578
Ma'am, make sure
he makes it inside safely.

43:24.708 --> 43:27.662
No, to the Champs-Elysées, any nightclub!

43:27.792 --> 43:29.412
I don't need a broad like her.

43:29.542 --> 43:31.745
I get all the chicks I want!

43:31.875 --> 43:34.708
Black ones, white ones, young ones...

43:35.292 --> 43:36.828
<i>And they have jobs like...</i>

43:36.958 --> 43:41.245
<i>Cleaning lady, childcare worker,
nurse, secretary...</i>

43:41.375 --> 43:44.542
<i>No way. I couldn't have a woman secretary.</i>

43:44.792 --> 43:47.537
<i>But you could be one, Alexandra.</i>

43:47.667 --> 43:49.412
<i>You would work for me!</i>

43:49.542 --> 43:51.750
<i>You wouldn't exist as you are.</i>

43:52.250 --> 43:53.703
<i>And if you didn't...</i>

43:53.833 --> 43:56.583
A masculist. A new conquest for you.

43:57.458 --> 43:59.125
This time it's different.

44:00.542 --> 44:01.833
Damien is my new novel.

44:02.750 --> 44:05.953
You haven't written a line
in over three years.

44:06.083 --> 44:08.417
I'd like to show

44:09.042 --> 44:12.167
that these guys aren't that different.

44:12.750 --> 44:15.328
What do they dream of? Settling down.

44:15.458 --> 44:17.412
They want us to love them,

44:17.542 --> 44:19.875
hold them in our arms, reassure them.

44:20.458 --> 44:22.708
So once I'm under his skin,

44:23.042 --> 44:26.417
however masculist he claims to be,
he'll be trapped.

44:26.833 --> 44:30.203
And when I leave him,
he'll go home crying to daddy.

44:30.333 --> 44:33.125
My book's going to teach him a lesson.

44:35.292 --> 44:37.292
It'll create a huge buzz.

44:37.500 --> 44:40.953
Whatshername had to resign
from government.

44:41.083 --> 44:44.917
Masculist testosterone is raging,
your timing's brash!

44:45.792 --> 44:49.125
I'm going to need an advance.

44:50.667 --> 44:53.750
You're forgetting
you've already gotten so much.

44:54.417 --> 44:57.245
Give me something to read
and I'll fight for you.

44:57.375 --> 44:58.958
Annie, I'm in deep shit.

45:01.167 --> 45:02.583
That'll change.

45:09.792 --> 45:11.703
Sleep well?

45:11.833 --> 45:14.453
I'm inviting you
to a cocktail party tonight.

45:14.583 --> 45:16.500
I want you to meet a friend.

45:17.500 --> 45:19.125
<i>I'll see what I can do.</i>

45:20.667 --> 45:22.625
Nice idea you had, Damien.

45:22.917 --> 45:24.870
My bouquet will soon wilt,

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
while your big cactus
will still be standing tall.

45:45.583 --> 45:47.203
I came to see my goddaughter.

45:47.333 --> 45:48.537
She's asleep.

45:48.667 --> 45:52.292
Actually, my brother's going to be
the godfather this time.

45:54.708 --> 45:55.708
Really?

45:56.625 --> 45:58.333
That's your choice.

45:59.708 --> 46:00.750
Can I come in?

46:01.417 --> 46:05.912
I know, I was going to tell you.
I screwed up.

46:06.042 --> 46:09.120
I can't work for her. She's hot for me.

46:09.250 --> 46:10.708
Do you hear yourself?

46:11.125 --> 46:14.328
- All those nights of whining.
- Me?

46:14.458 --> 46:17.328
Suddenly you're the best lay in town?

46:17.458 --> 46:18.958
Sorry, it's pathetic.

46:19.250 --> 46:20.375
What about Sibyl?

46:20.542 --> 46:23.333
You know your problem? You're uptight.

46:25.042 --> 46:26.745
From you, that's a compliment.

46:26.875 --> 46:30.537
You're uptight and complacent
in your little life.

46:30.667 --> 46:33.583
You don't see how your wife treats you.

46:34.333 --> 46:35.370
You accept everything.

46:35.500 --> 46:38.620
And you, nothing.
So you're jobless and live with a cat!

46:38.750 --> 46:40.250
What's the deal with my cat?

46:42.875 --> 46:44.870
Life is full of compromises.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.453
What if I don't get my job back?

46:47.583 --> 46:49.083
You can start a cupcake blog.

46:52.583 --> 46:53.833
That's mean.

46:55.042 --> 46:57.500
I'm telling you this because I love you.

46:57.917 --> 46:59.745
Can't you understand that?

46:59.875 --> 47:03.120
Things were great with Alexandra
till you came along.

47:03.250 --> 47:04.537
She's sweet with me.

47:04.667 --> 47:06.208
Know what she calls you?

47:07.208 --> 47:08.037
Fat Ass.

47:08.167 --> 47:09.167
Sweet, isn't it?

47:09.208 --> 47:11.792
Get out. I never want to see you again.

47:12.750 --> 47:13.833
Good.

47:14.792 --> 47:16.458
You freak me out.

47:24.417 --> 47:25.625
What do you think?

47:27.583 --> 47:28.583
You're right.

47:34.833 --> 47:35.958
Yeah.

47:48.833 --> 47:49.912
Seattle last week,

47:50.042 --> 47:53.453
next week Marseille. It never ends.

47:53.583 --> 47:54.995
Your husband's radiant!

47:55.125 --> 47:58.537
Thanks! I never get compliments.
Thank goodness for you.

47:58.667 --> 48:00.500
The complaints office is shut.

48:01.583 --> 48:03.667
Alexandra. Have you met before?

48:04.958 --> 48:06.083
Hi there.

48:07.583 --> 48:10.245
Alexandra Lamour, Brigitte Magre.
Her husband.

48:10.375 --> 48:12.037
My husband's one of your biggest fans.

48:12.167 --> 48:13.167
Good evening.

48:13.250 --> 48:15.912
- Your books are my escape.
- Thanks.

48:16.042 --> 48:18.620
She's writing a controversial new book.

48:18.750 --> 48:20.792
Fun! What's it about?

48:21.500 --> 48:24.453
She's tackling
the myth of female domination.

48:24.583 --> 48:26.083
Wouldn't you say?

48:28.042 --> 48:29.042
Excuse me.

48:29.250 --> 48:30.250
That's him.

48:31.375 --> 48:33.120
But he's over 26.

48:33.250 --> 48:35.745
I'm not courting him.
Damien is my subject.

48:35.875 --> 48:37.037
I get it.

48:37.167 --> 48:39.042
- How's Jean-Pierre?
- Fine, as usual.

48:39.583 --> 48:41.917
- Evening.
- Good evening, Damien.

48:42.583 --> 48:45.120
Annie Meyer, the publisher.
May I kiss you?

48:45.250 --> 48:48.208
I never miss a chance
to kiss a pretty man.

48:51.750 --> 48:53.667
I'd like a drink. Would you?

48:54.292 --> 48:55.292
I'll get it.

48:58.500 --> 49:02.167
I've heard the male cause
is your hobbyhorse.

49:02.458 --> 49:05.250
When's the revolution?
Will we lose our heads?

49:06.708 --> 49:07.787
I'm not at war.

49:07.917 --> 49:09.287
What do you want, then?

49:09.417 --> 49:11.833
Besides wearing a suit.

49:13.917 --> 49:15.453
Boxer shorts for men.

49:15.583 --> 49:16.792
Ever worn a G-string?

49:17.125 --> 49:18.750
That's true injustice.

49:19.250 --> 49:22.708
But you can't realize
if you haven't been there.

49:23.375 --> 49:24.912
What bothers you?

49:25.042 --> 49:28.287
Getting compliments,
having drinks brought to you?

49:28.417 --> 49:29.917
It doesn't make sense.

49:31.458 --> 49:33.083
Long live masculinity!

49:39.833 --> 49:41.875
I'm homesick, Alexandra.

49:42.792 --> 49:44.042
I want to see skirts.

49:44.958 --> 49:47.620
Legs, thighs, stiletto heels,

49:47.750 --> 49:50.703
fishnet stockings, little lace panties.

49:50.833 --> 49:54.458
On the other hand,
purses are quite convenient.

49:55.375 --> 49:56.625
Allow me.

49:58.375 --> 50:00.167
If you knew how lovely

50:00.625 --> 50:03.542
woman's cleavage looks in a push-up bra.

50:04.500 --> 50:06.625
How come you like that?

50:09.667 --> 50:11.375
A woman walking,

50:14.500 --> 50:16.208
her stockings swishing softly

50:16.458 --> 50:19.208
against her raincoat at each step.

50:21.667 --> 50:23.167
A strap snapping.

50:24.958 --> 50:26.292
A zipper unzipping.

50:28.458 --> 50:30.125
I can manage that.

50:30.708 --> 50:31.708
Come on.

50:32.500 --> 50:33.750
I said come on.

50:39.083 --> 50:41.578
RV like "rendezvous"?

50:41.708 --> 50:43.162
No, like "reverse".

50:43.292 --> 50:44.667
Good evening.

53:13.250 --> 53:14.458
This is heaven!

53:17.000 --> 53:18.292
You're gay!

53:18.792 --> 53:19.792
What?

53:20.667 --> 53:22.537
You're gay, right?

53:22.667 --> 53:24.417
Not at all!

53:24.750 --> 53:28.912
Yes you are, it's obvious.
Like lots of people here.

53:29.042 --> 53:30.250
Relax!

54:14.500 --> 54:15.995
Physical superiority,

54:16.125 --> 54:19.000
you can't deny it, it's nature.

54:21.333 --> 54:26.042
In my world,
prehistoric men starved women,

54:27.542 --> 54:29.917
who only got scraps from the hunt.

54:30.250 --> 54:32.583
That's what made them frail.

54:33.583 --> 54:35.167
For thousands of years.

54:38.250 --> 54:40.703
In my world, women were stronger

54:40.833 --> 54:43.583
so nature had them bear the children

54:44.583 --> 54:47.120
and go off hunting year-round

54:47.250 --> 54:50.042
while the men looked after the kids.

54:52.750 --> 54:55.250
In my world, men do the fighting,

54:55.792 --> 54:58.708
they stand up to each other and go to war.

55:03.292 --> 55:07.370
In my world, women have the upper hand.
Where do you think you are?

55:07.500 --> 55:08.583
In my bed.

55:10.500 --> 55:11.542
Wait.

55:23.250 --> 55:25.667
Aren't you coming?

55:36.375 --> 55:38.078
You've got a handsome nose.

55:38.208 --> 55:39.625
Kiss me.

55:59.125 --> 56:00.458
What are you doing?

56:02.167 --> 56:03.375
I have to go.

56:05.250 --> 56:06.667
I have a poker game.

56:08.500 --> 56:10.000
Don't lie to me.

56:12.125 --> 56:13.292
Go back to sleep.

56:23.458 --> 56:24.708
I like you.

56:26.792 --> 56:28.458
I like you too.

56:29.083 --> 56:30.578
But I'm not a good person.

56:30.708 --> 56:31.917
Me neither.

56:32.417 --> 56:35.750
I might disappear and never call you.

56:37.500 --> 56:38.625
Try it.

56:52.167 --> 56:55.542
SOW

57:01.125 --> 57:02.125
Farther.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.667
Look up high.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.250
Open, now cross your arms.

57:09.958 --> 57:11.333
More.

57:13.542 --> 57:14.542
That's it.

57:14.583 --> 57:15.583
<i>En dehors.</i>

57:18.417 --> 57:21.500
And one, two, three.

57:22.917 --> 57:23.917
<i>Piqué.</i>

57:24.042 --> 57:25.042
Good.

57:32.042 --> 57:33.703
Right. That's nice.

57:33.833 --> 57:35.245
Chocolate mousse, please.

57:35.375 --> 57:36.750
It'll make me fat.

57:37.333 --> 57:38.703
Cut it out!

57:38.833 --> 57:40.625
I watch my figure.

57:44.125 --> 57:47.078
How's your dad?
Did he tell you we had a fight?

57:47.208 --> 57:48.208
Yeah.

57:48.292 --> 57:50.792
I think you should call him.

57:52.417 --> 57:54.792
Thanks for coming today.

57:58.083 --> 57:59.500
What's wrong?

57:59.792 --> 58:03.833
There's this girl at school...

58:05.083 --> 58:07.458
- I'm crazy about her.
- That's great!

58:07.875 --> 58:09.333
Her name's Sarah.

58:11.042 --> 58:12.250
She's beautiful.

58:13.583 --> 58:14.750
The thing is,

58:15.167 --> 58:19.875
I was in the school bathroom
the other day,

58:21.000 --> 58:23.208
she came in and asked me to lick her.

58:25.250 --> 58:26.250
I see.

58:27.958 --> 58:29.078
Right.

58:29.208 --> 58:30.250
And I did.

58:31.958 --> 58:33.833
What about you, did she...?

58:34.542 --> 58:36.583
No, she didn't do anything.

58:36.875 --> 58:38.542
She felt me a little.

58:38.875 --> 58:40.417
That was nice of you!

58:42.125 --> 58:44.833
Sam, you did do it because you wanted to?

58:45.208 --> 58:46.537
Not much choice.

58:46.667 --> 58:48.245
There's always a choice.

58:48.375 --> 58:51.917
A girl can't make you lick her.
It's impossible.

58:56.333 --> 58:59.203
- I don't know what to do.
- Forget about her!

58:59.333 --> 59:02.167
There's no shortage of easy girls!

59:14.125 --> 59:16.703
So soon? I thought you'd never be back.

59:16.833 --> 59:18.958
Pretend I'm not here.

59:21.708 --> 59:24.000
Are you having some trouble?

59:25.792 --> 59:27.333
Bad neighborhood.

59:30.625 --> 59:35.037
Since you're here
I may as well call the painter.

59:35.167 --> 59:38.250
I have to go out, could you wait for her?

59:38.833 --> 59:39.833
Sure.

59:40.458 --> 59:43.787
If you get bored
you could do some more work.

59:43.917 --> 59:45.412
I can't cope without you.

59:45.542 --> 59:47.500
For free? In your dreams.

59:48.042 --> 59:50.500
- How much?
- Did you win all that?

59:50.917 --> 59:54.287
I owe this, I could give you...

59:54.417 --> 59:55.417
No.

59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.620
Would you mind ironing some shirts?

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:03.500
Mr. Martel's watching his nieces
this week.

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:05.833
Don't you know how to iron?

01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:10.750
I have an idea.

01:00:11.042 --> 01:00:13.412
Let's go out later.
I'll take you shopping.

01:00:13.542 --> 01:00:17.750
Sound good?
I can spoil you, I owe you that.

01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:19.792
My lucky charm.

01:00:32.167 --> 01:00:35.458
<i>Turn the shirt over,
dampen the collar if it's stiff</i>

01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:37.667
<i>and iron on the outside.</i>

01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:41.250
<i>Do up the top two buttons...</i>

01:00:49.417 --> 01:00:51.167
Your language sounds nice.

01:00:52.375 --> 01:00:53.500
Thank you.

01:00:53.792 --> 01:00:55.162
What's a "sow"?

01:00:55.292 --> 01:00:58.620
Actually, it's a female pig.

01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:00.000
The boar's mate.

01:01:01.667 --> 01:01:04.000
But it's mainly an insult.

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:07.828
It means disgusting,

01:01:07.958 --> 01:01:09.245
sex maniac, bitch.

01:01:09.375 --> 01:01:10.417
Bitch?

01:01:12.208 --> 01:01:13.542
Her, a bitch?

01:01:15.417 --> 01:01:16.958
I know that word.

01:01:17.667 --> 01:01:21.203
Fatherfucker, ho, cow...

01:01:21.333 --> 01:01:23.458
That's it, exactly.

01:01:37.042 --> 01:01:38.912
You'll think of me every second.

01:01:39.042 --> 01:01:40.833
I can't accept that.

01:01:41.083 --> 01:01:42.917
Why not? Don't you like it?

01:01:43.583 --> 01:01:45.125
It's nice.

01:01:46.125 --> 01:01:47.412
A little thin.

01:01:47.542 --> 01:01:50.578
It's masculine.
Big watches look bad on men.

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:52.870
I prefer a bigger one.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.333
You really are different.

01:01:54.542 --> 01:01:55.583
Let's go.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.412
Lovers in Paris are like tourists,

01:02:06.542 --> 01:02:07.625
aren't they?

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:10.458
- Who in Paris?
- What?

01:02:10.958 --> 01:02:12.167
What did I say?

01:02:13.083 --> 01:02:16.292
People like us in Paris...

01:02:21.125 --> 01:02:21.953
Let's go.

01:02:22.083 --> 01:02:23.870
Stop, you keep running away.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.458
- No, I don't.
- Yes.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.125
I'm here.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.208
I'm here.

01:02:49.375 --> 01:02:50.500
Christophe!

01:02:54.667 --> 01:02:57.333
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

01:02:58.625 --> 01:03:02.083
Please say something.
Quit being all huffy.

01:03:03.583 --> 01:03:04.833
Forgive me.

01:03:05.083 --> 01:03:08.458
Say, "Would you please forgive me."

01:03:08.667 --> 01:03:10.412
You're such a pain!

01:03:10.542 --> 01:03:14.037
Usually I do whatever I can
to get rid of women

01:03:14.167 --> 01:03:15.375
but with her,

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:17.667
I'm afraid she'll disappear.

01:03:18.667 --> 01:03:19.667
You're in love.

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:20.750
No!

01:03:23.125 --> 01:03:24.833
It'll end bad anyway.

01:03:25.792 --> 01:03:26.662
How so?

01:03:26.792 --> 01:03:29.667
You'll either split up
or one of you will die.

01:03:30.875 --> 01:03:32.583
Enjoy it while you can.

01:03:33.667 --> 01:03:34.833
Are you alright?

01:03:35.625 --> 01:03:37.000
Lolo's cheating on me.

01:03:37.542 --> 01:03:38.542
Really?

01:03:39.542 --> 01:03:42.500
I found a hotel receipt in her pocket.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.833
Did you ask her?

01:03:45.625 --> 01:03:46.750
She denied it.

01:03:47.875 --> 01:03:49.792
Then maybe it's nothing.

01:03:53.292 --> 01:03:55.875
This fat cuckold isn't done yet.

01:03:56.417 --> 01:03:59.167
I'm gonna send the little asshole packing.

01:04:11.292 --> 01:04:13.208
Do you have to work today?

01:04:14.458 --> 01:04:16.125
Where do you go to write?

01:04:16.292 --> 01:04:17.417
Depends.

01:04:18.167 --> 01:04:19.583
Can I read it one day?

01:04:20.625 --> 01:04:22.083
What are your plans?

01:04:22.958 --> 01:04:25.412
I have a job interview in a bar.

01:04:25.542 --> 01:04:27.037
That's dumb.

01:04:27.167 --> 01:04:28.458
It's just temporary.

01:04:29.375 --> 01:04:31.208
I'd pay you twice as much.

01:04:31.708 --> 01:04:36.042
I don't want to depend on you
or be at your command.

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:41.953
What's this outdated masculist drivel?

01:04:42.083 --> 01:04:44.578
Not masculist. I want to be your equal.

01:04:44.708 --> 01:04:46.875
- That's stupid!
- Why?

01:04:47.125 --> 01:04:49.667
- It's absurd.
- Maybe it is masculism.

01:04:49.875 --> 01:04:52.453
- Fine, I'm a masculist!
- Ridiculous.

01:04:52.583 --> 01:04:53.912
Why are you upset?

01:04:54.042 --> 01:04:56.458
I want to give us a chance.

01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:01.792
I'm not sure I can give you what you want.

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:06.250
Me neither, for what it's worth.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
We're on the same wavelength.

01:05:12.417 --> 01:05:13.458
That's rare.

01:05:33.917 --> 01:05:34.958
Hello.

01:05:36.417 --> 01:05:37.620
Is Alexandra in?

01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:39.583
No, was she expecting you?

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:41.078
Who are you?

01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:43.662
Damien. Alexandra's friend.

01:05:43.792 --> 01:05:46.625
Daffodil. I left a ring in the bedroom.

01:05:48.583 --> 01:05:51.583
A friend, huh? I'll give you friends!

01:06:03.917 --> 01:06:05.875
Daffodil's here...

01:06:08.708 --> 01:06:10.375
- You ok?
- Yeah!

01:06:12.833 --> 01:06:14.667
Call the cops

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.375
What are you doing?

01:06:23.792 --> 01:06:24.917
That's irrational.

01:06:25.208 --> 01:06:26.375
Irrational?

01:06:27.333 --> 01:06:30.292
You know who she is?
A narcissistic pervert!

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:33.370
She collects men like objects.
Is that rational?

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:35.375
Each conquest is a marble!

01:06:37.083 --> 01:06:39.542
You saw the witch jars on her shelf.

01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:43.292
She compares her performance
from year to year.

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:47.500
Look at your face. Who's the fool now?

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.333
We're in the same boat, pal.

01:06:56.167 --> 01:06:58.042
She made me feel intelligent.

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:00.792
Important, since she chose me.

01:07:01.458 --> 01:07:03.292
How could I be so stupid?

01:07:06.833 --> 01:07:08.125
Look at me now.

01:07:08.792 --> 01:07:10.370
I'm nothing anymore.

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:13.042
Look what she's done to me.

01:07:16.292 --> 01:07:19.292
Stay away from me! Who knows what I'll do!

01:07:22.542 --> 01:07:23.828
TINY TITS

01:07:23.958 --> 01:07:25.412
Who is he?

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:27.583
Nobody. Nothing.

01:07:30.333 --> 01:07:32.208
You shouldn't let people in.

01:07:32.542 --> 01:07:35.458
I owe money all over,
tons of women are after me.

01:07:37.083 --> 01:07:39.875
One was waiting downstairs
the other night.

01:07:40.542 --> 01:07:42.162
I kicked her ass.

01:07:42.292 --> 01:07:44.375
- What's this about?
- What?

01:07:46.042 --> 01:07:47.375
The jars on the shelf.

01:07:48.458 --> 01:07:51.412
- You snooped?
- Is each marble a lay?

01:07:51.542 --> 01:07:53.037
- That guy's sick.
- Answer me!

01:07:53.167 --> 01:07:55.375
- Don't make a scene.
- Am I in there?

01:07:56.458 --> 01:07:58.417
Am I a peewee or a shooter?

01:07:59.083 --> 01:08:02.912
You think you can flick me away
anytime you like?

01:08:03.042 --> 01:08:04.787
I don't get your reaction.

01:08:04.917 --> 01:08:06.250
But you're so smart.

01:08:06.667 --> 01:08:09.000
Did you think I was a virgin?

01:08:09.375 --> 01:08:10.662
That you were my first?

01:08:10.792 --> 01:08:13.287
You're no better, I hear.

01:08:13.417 --> 01:08:14.703
What does that mean?

01:08:14.833 --> 01:08:16.957
You've no right to be offended.

01:08:18.417 --> 01:08:19.542
I get it.

01:08:20.375 --> 01:08:22.292
I have to behave, but you...

01:08:22.707 --> 01:08:24.042
Why change?

01:08:24.707 --> 01:08:27.207
I was wrong when I said we were the same.

01:08:27.832 --> 01:08:28.912
Have fun.

01:08:29.042 --> 01:08:30.042
Wait.

01:08:33.875 --> 01:08:35.375
I don't want to play anymore.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.750
I feel grown-up with you.

01:08:40.542 --> 01:08:42.287
That line won't work.

01:08:42.417 --> 01:08:44.042
I've used it too many times.

01:09:15.125 --> 01:09:17.167
That's a big sandwich!

01:09:19.707 --> 01:09:20.875
Want it?

01:09:21.167 --> 01:09:24.042
It's just ham,
nothing to get all wet about.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.787
Here, you can have it!

01:09:26.917 --> 01:09:28.500
What? Come back.

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:30.542
You were talking. Come back!

01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:38.578
Thank you.

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:40.207
I've become a victim.

01:09:41.207 --> 01:09:42.703
What were you before?

01:09:42.832 --> 01:09:43.875
An oppressor.

01:09:44.582 --> 01:09:46.417
Maybe there's another way?

01:09:47.125 --> 01:09:49.792
A world where men and women
help each other.

01:09:49.957 --> 01:09:52.417
We work well together, right?

01:09:53.875 --> 01:09:55.078
How are your teeth?

01:09:55.208 --> 01:09:56.375
Better.

01:10:01.708 --> 01:10:02.708
Left, right.

01:10:03.125 --> 01:10:04.917
Left hook. Uppercut.

01:10:10.333 --> 01:10:11.417
Move back.

01:10:11.917 --> 01:10:13.828
If you're too close, no defense.

01:10:13.958 --> 01:10:15.453
Step back to attack.

01:10:15.583 --> 01:10:17.125
I need to hit something.

01:10:20.958 --> 01:10:21.958
Gently!

01:10:22.042 --> 01:10:24.037
Take it out on the bag.

01:10:24.167 --> 01:10:25.250
You bet.

01:10:26.833 --> 01:10:29.620
<i>Isn't the Immaculate Conception
absolute power?</i>

01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:33.500
<i>We've got the Virgin Mary too
but Jesus is the hero.</i>

01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:35.667
<i>I like that beauty spot.</i>

01:10:36.042 --> 01:10:37.042
<i>I like you.</i>

01:10:37.083 --> 01:10:40.375
<i>I like you too, but I'm not a good person.</i>

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.787
I can't wait to read the rest!

01:11:11.917 --> 01:11:14.708
It's harsh, she's going to destroy him.

01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:18.542
- Really?
- He hasn't got a clue.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.328
Such a delight!

01:11:21.458 --> 01:11:22.708
I'm not real sure.

01:11:24.375 --> 01:11:29.287
I don't know if it's that relevant,
intellectually speaking.

01:11:29.417 --> 01:11:31.750
It's amazing! As cruel as can be.

01:11:31.958 --> 01:11:35.162
I wonder if I'm not getting off track.

01:11:35.292 --> 01:11:37.203
There's more to life than men.

01:11:37.333 --> 01:11:39.750
Who cares about masculists anyway?

01:11:40.917 --> 01:11:42.458
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

01:11:42.792 --> 01:11:45.833
I could write about a Taliban headwoman,

01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:50.787
or a new mafia godmother
in Mexico or Ecuador.

01:11:50.917 --> 01:11:53.995
Or maybe a pedophile priestess instead.

01:11:54.125 --> 01:11:56.875
Anything but a cheap romance!

01:11:57.292 --> 01:11:59.458
Are you falling into your own trap?

01:12:00.083 --> 01:12:02.328
Good intentions don't make great books.

01:12:02.458 --> 01:12:05.912
Think about your career.
You've always been a winner.

01:12:06.042 --> 01:12:09.870
There'll be a lot of media hype,
don't ruin it for a guy.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.208
An author must think with her brain.

01:12:13.375 --> 01:12:15.245
There's a check waiting for you.

01:12:15.375 --> 01:12:18.917
You can pick it up or not.
It's your choice.

01:12:20.042 --> 01:12:21.042
Right?

01:12:21.875 --> 01:12:23.500
- This game sucks.
- Fifty.

01:12:23.833 --> 01:12:26.208
- What would you like?
- Your ass, on my lap.

01:12:27.125 --> 01:12:27.953
Classy!

01:12:28.083 --> 01:12:29.120
Steph!

01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:30.417
Excuse her.

01:12:30.958 --> 01:12:32.495
Bourbon, like the ladies.

01:12:32.625 --> 01:12:34.917
Some ice too, please, Anis.

01:12:37.958 --> 01:12:39.787
Who is Anis exactly?

01:12:39.917 --> 01:12:40.917
Anus!

01:12:40.958 --> 01:12:41.958
Anis!

01:12:42.625 --> 01:12:43.917
You're gross!

01:12:44.167 --> 01:12:46.745
He's been working here a couple weeks.

01:12:46.875 --> 01:12:48.417
Not only is he lovely,

01:12:48.708 --> 01:12:50.083
he's got brains too.

01:12:50.625 --> 01:12:51.453
Shit!

01:12:51.583 --> 01:12:53.708
I popped his poker cherry.

01:12:56.042 --> 01:12:57.458
I fold.

01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:00.662
All in.

01:13:00.792 --> 01:13:02.083
250.

01:13:03.042 --> 01:13:04.125
Fold.

01:13:07.375 --> 01:13:08.583
I'll see you.

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:11.583
Pair of kings.

01:13:13.667 --> 01:13:14.708
Pair of queens.

01:13:18.083 --> 01:13:19.583
Lucky at cards...

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:41.500
It's me.

01:13:44.125 --> 01:13:45.125
Yes.

01:13:45.667 --> 01:13:47.458
I know, I'm late.

01:13:48.917 --> 01:13:50.500
I'm not coming.

01:13:50.667 --> 01:13:51.708
What?

01:13:52.833 --> 01:13:55.083
I wanted to tell you it's over.

01:13:56.958 --> 01:13:58.495
With you, Annie.

01:13:58.625 --> 01:14:00.912
I'm through with your book,
your media hype.

01:14:01.042 --> 01:14:03.375
<i>What are you saying? Are you drunk?</i>

01:14:03.542 --> 01:14:04.542
<i>You're nuts!</i>

01:14:04.625 --> 01:14:05.750
Fuck you.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.708
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

01:14:13.542 --> 01:14:15.167
<i>So you love all of me?</i>

01:14:16.708 --> 01:14:17.708
<i>Yes.</i>

01:14:19.167 --> 01:14:20.792
<i>I love all of you,</i>

01:14:21.375 --> 01:14:22.500
<i>tenderly,</i>

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:24.667
<i>tragically.</i>

01:14:27.417 --> 01:14:28.417
<i>Me too.</i>

01:14:43.583 --> 01:14:44.833
It's Lolo.

01:14:48.125 --> 01:14:49.125
How are you?

01:14:49.167 --> 01:14:51.042
Fine, and you?

01:14:51.917 --> 01:14:53.912
Things are complicated.

01:14:54.042 --> 01:14:55.953
Christophe kicked me out.

01:14:56.083 --> 01:14:57.745
He did? What's going on?

01:14:57.875 --> 01:14:59.042
Can I come in?

01:15:00.875 --> 01:15:02.208
Got a beer?

01:15:02.667 --> 01:15:03.667
Always do.

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:05.167
- Have one with me?
- Sure.

01:15:09.417 --> 01:15:11.083
Classy kimono.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.667
You screwed up, Lolo.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.583
I swear I didn't.

01:15:18.125 --> 01:15:20.542
- Christophe made it all up.
- Not with me.

01:15:21.333 --> 01:15:23.875
Why would I lie to you?

01:15:27.625 --> 01:15:28.828
I did slip up.

01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:30.125
There.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.542
I was pregnant, hormones raging.

01:15:34.292 --> 01:15:35.370
I lost control.

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.958
You gotta call him, talk to him.

01:15:39.625 --> 01:15:40.792
Please.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.125
It's tough.

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:51.250
Why didn't it work out, you and me?

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:53.917
No reason. It was cool.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.208
We were good in bed, weren't we?

01:15:59.333 --> 01:16:00.708
Yeah, it was cool.

01:16:04.167 --> 01:16:05.375
But I was scared.

01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:08.750
Of what?

01:16:08.958 --> 01:16:11.625
You. I was intimidated by you.

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.167
- You knew what you wanted.
- Did I?

01:16:17.375 --> 01:16:19.625
Men are so much more mature.

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:26.542
We women could go for years
making booty calls.

01:16:26.833 --> 01:16:28.250
But you're not scared.

01:16:29.167 --> 01:16:31.875
Not afraid to say
you're the love of my life.

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:33.875
I've never said that.

01:16:36.375 --> 01:16:37.792
Not you.

01:16:39.333 --> 01:16:42.417
When we met,
Christophe slid a card under my door.

01:16:42.625 --> 01:16:45.792
That Magritte painting,
<i>This is not a pipe</i>.

01:16:47.792 --> 01:16:52.000
On the back he'd written
"This is not a love letter."

01:16:54.708 --> 01:16:56.417
How can you resist that?

01:17:54.167 --> 01:17:56.750
I booked a room, Mr. and Mrs. Lamour.

01:18:05.708 --> 01:18:06.708
They're off!

01:19:26.875 --> 01:19:28.375
There's a noise.

01:19:29.917 --> 01:19:31.208
I'll pull over.

01:20:01.583 --> 01:20:02.833
Want me to do it?

01:20:12.458 --> 01:20:13.875
Do you buy all that?

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:17.500
Yes.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:20.708
I believe in God.

01:20:21.792 --> 01:20:22.833
She's good to me.

01:20:23.583 --> 01:20:25.537
You believe in sin and Hell?

01:20:25.667 --> 01:20:27.120
- No.
- Go to confession?

01:20:27.250 --> 01:20:28.292
That I do.

01:20:29.083 --> 01:20:32.125
Really? What do you have to say?

01:20:35.083 --> 01:20:36.250
Will you marry me?

01:20:42.042 --> 01:20:45.667
You don't have to answer right away.
Take your time.

01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:48.208
I'm gonna stretch my legs.

01:20:48.958 --> 01:20:50.083
Warm, isn't it?

01:20:50.667 --> 01:20:52.870
Why'd I buy this jacket?

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.167
Yes.

01:20:54.917 --> 01:20:55.917
What?

01:21:13.292 --> 01:21:17.370
Christophe, your wife is solid.
Good head on her shoulders.

01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:21.162
You're bound to hit some snags
after a few years.

01:21:21.292 --> 01:21:23.167
True, they stray sometimes.

01:21:23.458 --> 01:21:24.953
It's not a big deal.

01:21:25.083 --> 01:21:25.953
Dad.

01:21:26.083 --> 01:21:29.625
When I realized I'd get a few quiet nights

01:21:30.375 --> 01:21:31.995
I kept my mouth shut.

01:21:32.125 --> 01:21:33.917
Stop it! That's grim.

01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:36.208
Boy talk does a body good.

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:39.667
Martine's older
and doesn't need it so much.

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:43.620
But before, she'd get these sudden urges.

01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:46.292
What would happen? She'd close the shop

01:21:46.542 --> 01:21:47.833
and we'd do it there.

01:21:49.125 --> 01:21:52.370
She'd have me
right up on the chopping block.

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:54.125
I had no say in it.

01:21:54.667 --> 01:21:56.792
Sounds crazy but that's how it was.

01:21:57.917 --> 01:21:59.875
I didn't dare say no.

01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:02.792
You did your best, Alain.

01:22:03.458 --> 01:22:04.500
Sure.

01:22:06.458 --> 01:22:07.583
Then again,

01:22:09.083 --> 01:22:12.125
women are little girls without us.

01:22:17.042 --> 01:22:19.125
Here, this is yours.

01:22:19.583 --> 01:22:20.583
You can keep it.

01:22:23.125 --> 01:22:24.125
Dad,

01:22:26.292 --> 01:22:27.667
I met someone.

01:22:34.292 --> 01:22:36.495
Where's your engagement ring?

01:22:36.625 --> 01:22:39.495
The wedding ring itself is a huge step.

01:22:39.625 --> 01:22:41.703
He's come a long way.

01:22:41.833 --> 01:22:42.953
Congratulations.

01:22:43.083 --> 01:22:44.583
Or condolences?

01:22:46.042 --> 01:22:49.453
Before the march,
we'll go by the Collège de France.

01:22:49.583 --> 01:22:50.912
What for?

01:22:51.042 --> 01:22:52.500
They're giving an award.

01:22:53.083 --> 01:22:54.953
The clitocrats are so smug.

01:22:55.083 --> 01:22:56.995
Only three men honored in 44 years.

01:22:57.125 --> 01:22:58.125
Hussies!

01:22:58.250 --> 01:22:59.250
Tarnishing our image!

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.078
What about solidarity?

01:23:01.208 --> 01:23:03.208
Licker! Go back home!

01:23:03.583 --> 01:23:04.662
Pisses me off.

01:23:04.792 --> 01:23:06.375
You're badass!

01:23:10.667 --> 01:23:11.667
Sluts!

01:23:14.208 --> 01:23:15.375
Cool it!

01:23:16.542 --> 01:23:18.125
Let's stay focused.

01:23:25.292 --> 01:23:26.870
Hello dear colleagues!

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.162
I don't believe this. Get lost!

01:23:29.292 --> 01:23:30.787
Kitchen's that way, boys!

01:23:30.917 --> 01:23:32.453
You know we love you.

01:23:32.583 --> 01:23:35.120
I have a husband and four sons.

01:23:35.250 --> 01:23:36.620
I only have male dogs.

01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:39.125
I'm not your enemy.

01:23:39.583 --> 01:23:40.958
- Hello.
- I know you!

01:23:41.792 --> 01:23:43.000
Hi, colleague.

01:23:43.542 --> 01:23:45.953
Poor kid. Nothing better to do?

01:23:46.083 --> 01:23:48.078
Not much going on?

01:23:48.208 --> 01:23:49.912
Yes! He's getting married.

01:23:50.042 --> 01:23:53.578
Does the lucky woman know
you're a militant?

01:23:53.708 --> 01:23:56.162
Ask her. It's Alexandra.

01:23:56.292 --> 01:23:59.375
Some women are more open-minded
than others.

01:23:59.708 --> 01:24:02.787
So much so she's already married
to a lovely man.

01:24:02.917 --> 01:24:04.000
Didn't you know?

01:24:05.833 --> 01:24:07.042
Oops, I goofed.

01:24:11.708 --> 01:24:12.792
Are you ok?

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.333
Wait! Stop!

01:24:38.417 --> 01:24:39.912
Alexandra, open up!

01:24:40.042 --> 01:24:41.042
Open up!

01:24:54.458 --> 01:24:55.500
Hello.

01:24:57.708 --> 01:25:00.203
Hello Mr. Martel. I forgot my key.

01:25:00.333 --> 01:25:01.745
I can't give it to you.

01:25:01.875 --> 01:25:03.958
You see me every day with her!

01:25:04.458 --> 01:25:06.583
I mind my own business.

01:25:08.708 --> 01:25:11.458
I ran out for soap
and left the bath running.

01:25:12.333 --> 01:25:13.417
Don't cry.

01:25:19.083 --> 01:25:20.537
Bring it back, ok?

01:25:20.667 --> 01:25:22.958
Us guys gotta stick together.

01:25:46.167 --> 01:25:49.042
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

01:26:13.708 --> 01:26:15.042
Hi!

01:26:16.042 --> 01:26:17.042
You've grown!

01:26:17.208 --> 01:26:18.583
I'll get my jacket.

01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:20.370
The door, Alice!

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:21.958
The dog'll get out.

01:26:23.833 --> 01:26:25.662
Sudden urge to see your kid?

01:26:25.792 --> 01:26:27.162
Hello Alexandre.

01:26:27.292 --> 01:26:30.078
Since I'm here,
I'll tell you I filed for divorce.

01:26:30.208 --> 01:26:32.208
This time you won't refuse.

01:26:32.708 --> 01:26:34.625
I don't want to talk to you.

01:26:46.583 --> 01:26:49.667
Come on.

01:26:53.125 --> 01:26:54.208
Good evening.

01:26:56.208 --> 01:26:57.245
Good afternoon.

01:26:57.375 --> 01:27:02.120
I gave your key to that tall bulky guy.
Hope that's ok.

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:03.078
Damien?

01:27:03.208 --> 01:27:06.787
That's fine. You did the right thing.

01:27:06.917 --> 01:27:08.625
Is dinner for three ok?

01:27:09.333 --> 01:27:11.042
That's nice.

01:27:20.167 --> 01:27:22.583
I'll order pizza. Wait here for me.

01:27:23.333 --> 01:27:24.375
What?

01:27:24.708 --> 01:27:26.042
No way!

01:27:26.958 --> 01:27:28.125
I'm going home.

01:27:28.458 --> 01:27:30.787
It's always the same crap with you.

01:27:30.917 --> 01:27:32.458
You'll never change.

01:27:36.083 --> 01:27:40.583
I'M NOT AN EASY MAN

01:27:48.208 --> 01:27:49.375
Leave him alone, girls!

01:27:49.667 --> 01:27:51.042
We just wanna talk.

01:27:51.583 --> 01:27:52.787
I don't want any trouble.

01:27:52.917 --> 01:27:55.412
He's sad. We need to cheer him up.

01:27:55.542 --> 01:27:58.417
Maybe I'm looking for trouble.

01:28:00.125 --> 01:28:02.167
I remember your pineapple panties.

01:28:03.625 --> 01:28:05.875
Trouble's calling my name.

01:28:10.417 --> 01:28:11.583
Maybe that's him.

01:28:16.042 --> 01:28:17.208
Hi, Erica.

01:28:19.167 --> 01:28:20.167
Shit.

01:28:21.833 --> 01:28:23.328
I couldn't reach him.

01:28:23.458 --> 01:28:24.458
Who is it?

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:25.875
What's going on?

01:28:26.792 --> 01:28:29.083
I'm on my way.

01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:32.787
Damien's drunk,

01:28:32.917 --> 01:28:34.870
some rough gals are hassling him. I'm off.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.708
Don't worry,
she handles lushes all the time.

01:28:39.042 --> 01:28:40.745
Then why'd she call me?

01:28:40.875 --> 01:28:43.333
I'll come with you, darling. Sibyl?

01:28:44.208 --> 01:28:46.703
I don't want to leave Stan all by himself.

01:28:46.833 --> 01:28:48.583
Forget it.

01:28:49.125 --> 01:28:50.375
Want my mace?

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:51.625
Lolo's got this!

01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:53.120
- Keep cool.
- Right.

01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:56.708
Look who's here. Thanks for everything.

01:28:57.250 --> 01:28:59.328
We're getting Damien. He's in trouble.

01:28:59.458 --> 01:29:01.787
What sort of trouble?

01:29:01.917 --> 01:29:02.917
I dunno.

01:29:04.792 --> 01:29:06.042
I'll beat 'em up.

01:29:10.625 --> 01:29:12.042
You want it, don't ya?

01:29:14.083 --> 01:29:15.245
You ain't so young.

01:29:15.375 --> 01:29:16.537
What are you doing?

01:29:16.667 --> 01:29:18.333
No, wait! Stop.

01:29:20.958 --> 01:29:24.250
You're hurting me. Stop!

01:29:25.792 --> 01:29:26.620
Where is he?

01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:29.083
In the bathroom. He looked woozy.

01:29:30.375 --> 01:29:32.333
You think it's funny?

01:29:36.958 --> 01:29:37.958
Stop!

01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:39.792
Lolo!

01:29:40.583 --> 01:29:42.292
Stop, darling!

01:29:44.708 --> 01:29:47.833
Hands off her, bitch!

01:29:48.333 --> 01:29:49.458
I'll kill you!

01:29:50.375 --> 01:29:51.708
Call the cops!

01:29:54.208 --> 01:29:55.208
What happened?

01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:57.953
Come here.

01:29:58.083 --> 01:29:59.912
Stay away from me.

01:30:00.042 --> 01:30:01.495
- What's wrong?
- Leave me.

01:30:01.625 --> 01:30:03.453
- Are you crazy?
- Leave me alone!

01:30:03.583 --> 01:30:06.245
I'm crazy like all the guys you toy with.

01:30:06.375 --> 01:30:08.042
I know everything, you bitch.

01:30:08.375 --> 01:30:10.292
Come on, I can explain.

01:30:10.875 --> 01:30:12.875
- Come on.
- Hands off!

01:30:13.542 --> 01:30:14.667
Listen to me.

01:30:15.667 --> 01:30:17.745
Yes, I lied to you.

01:30:17.875 --> 01:30:20.162
I recorded our conversations
day and night.

01:30:20.292 --> 01:30:21.703
- I did that.
- What?

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:24.037
I wrote that trashy book about us.

01:30:24.167 --> 01:30:25.167
But it's over.

01:30:25.208 --> 01:30:26.537
You did what?

01:30:26.667 --> 01:30:28.412
I was lost, I had writer's block

01:30:28.542 --> 01:30:31.203
then you came along
and things started again,

01:30:31.333 --> 01:30:33.125
but I got all mixed up.

01:30:33.875 --> 01:30:35.828
What did you do?

01:30:35.958 --> 01:30:37.500
What have you done?

01:30:37.708 --> 01:30:40.000
What did you write about me?

01:30:40.250 --> 01:30:41.078
Nothing!

01:30:41.208 --> 01:30:43.078
What have you done?

01:30:43.208 --> 01:30:45.375
I love you, Damien! Stop it!

01:30:48.458 --> 01:30:51.333
- I even filed for divorce.
- Shut up!

01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:07.245
PARAMEDICS

01:31:07.375 --> 01:31:08.583
Can you hear me?

01:31:15.625 --> 01:31:17.333
Are you hurt somewhere?

01:31:21.583 --> 01:31:23.333
You're in an ambulance.

01:31:24.167 --> 01:31:25.917
Open your eyes.

01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:28.167
What's going on?

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.120
You're with us.

01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:33.000
Don't try to get up.

01:31:34.417 --> 01:31:35.662
Let me out.

01:31:35.792 --> 01:31:37.203
Please, be sensible.

01:31:37.333 --> 01:31:39.370
- Lie down.
- Let's strap her in.

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.208
Open the door right now!

01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:42.917
Open the door!

01:31:43.333 --> 01:31:44.792
Another hysterical woman.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.708
Hello, Miss.

01:33:18.458 --> 01:33:19.792
A beer, please.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.203
Stand together, fight the fight!

01:33:53.333 --> 01:33:56.833
Women of the world unite!

01:34:21.667 --> 01:34:22.667
RESIST

01:34:22.750 --> 01:34:25.495
WOMEN IN THE STREETS
THE PATRIARCHY IS PISSING ITSELF

01:34:25.625 --> 01:34:27.495
