WEBVTT

00:15.057 --> 00:19.228
Come on! Let's use all the water we have!

00:19.311 --> 00:22.731
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Use sheets to put out the fire.

00:41.124 --> 00:45.462
Tear down these huts.
We need to make a firebreak.

00:46.964 --> 00:50.342
I hate these fires.
You want to kill me? Come on!

01:20.038 --> 01:21.290
What's burning?

01:21.874 --> 01:25.544
It's Sagar Wada.
It's where Lin was staying.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.423
You said yourself he's gone.

01:32.885 --> 01:33.886
I'm cold.

01:54.615 --> 01:58.202
All right. You have to keep this clean.
You understand?

01:58.285 --> 01:59.453
Understand. Okay.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.537
All right. Good man.

02:07.419 --> 02:08.794
Salaam alaikum, Mr. Lin.

02:08.878 --> 02:10.339
Wa alaikumu assalam.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.591
I'm Qasim Ali, headman here.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.135
Prabhu has told me all about you.

02:15.802 --> 02:16.970
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.556
Thank you for what you are doing.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.767
Well, I could do more
with better supplies.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.393
If you get me whatever you have--

02:23.477 --> 02:26.063
Some of these people need hospital,
drugs, IVs.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.607
Yes, but none of these things
will be coming here.

02:29.316 --> 02:30.859
You already have what we have, huh?

02:32.110 --> 02:33.487
Parvati?

02:34.196 --> 02:35.781
Can someone take a look at Lakshmi?

02:35.864 --> 02:37.533
What happened? What happened, Lakshmi?

02:37.616 --> 02:38.909
Lin, come here!

02:41.745 --> 02:42.871
Okay, bring her here.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.874
I need another table, to lie her down.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.963
Slowly. Easy, easy.

02:51.880 --> 02:55.133
Okay. You're all right. No, you're okay.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.469
You're all right. Easy. You're all right.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.893
Ask her if she's having trouble breathing.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.527
She needs a hospital
to take out that metal.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.404
-What, you can't do this?
-No. No way.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.990
I think it's punctured her lung.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.825
-Mom.
-Ravi!

03:19.908 --> 03:22.953
No. No, no, no! It came out.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.788
-Ravi!
-Mom!

03:24.872 --> 03:27.124
Prabhu! Put your hands on there,
all right?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.625
Solid pressure.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.047
Move your hands. Move your hands!

03:35.841 --> 03:37.634
-I need you to hold her. All right?
-Okay.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.052
-Don't let her move.
-Okay.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.722
Tell her this is gonna help her breathe.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.224
Don't touch her!

03:56.653 --> 03:59.281
Get away from my mother!

03:59.364 --> 04:00.949
Qasim, I need to be able to hear.

04:01.033 --> 04:04.286
Ravi, stop! He's trying to help her.

04:09.499 --> 04:10.918
-Ravi.
-That good?

04:12.544 --> 04:14.755
-Ravi. Ravi.
-Mom!

04:14.838 --> 04:16.255
Ravi.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.050
Shit. Fuck.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.177
-What happened?
-She needs a doctor now.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.221
Move! Move!

04:22.304 --> 04:24.640
Prabhu, help me lift her.

04:24.723 --> 04:27.059
On three. One, two, three.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.522
-Mom.
-Mr. Lin, where are you taking her?

04:32.189 --> 04:34.608
She needs a doctor,
or she's gonna die quickly.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.820
Then let her die
surrounded by the people she loves.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.781
I want her to live
with the people she loves,

04:40.864 --> 04:42.241
not die with them. Prabhu?

04:42.324 --> 04:45.452
-This is wrong.
-On three. One, two, three.

04:45.536 --> 04:46.954
-Ravi. Ravi.
-Lakshmi, it's okay.

04:47.037 --> 04:49.164
-We're taking you to the doctor.
-Go, go, go!

04:49.248 --> 04:50.666
Ravi. Ravi! Ravi.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.835
Don't worry, Ravi.
They're helping your mother.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.213
Lin.

04:58.173 --> 04:59.925
Lin, listen!

05:00.008 --> 05:02.177
She's not dying, Prabhu.
Not because of me.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.471
Hey! We need help!

05:06.682 --> 05:08.725
Hey! Stop! Hey!

05:08.809 --> 05:11.478
-Prabhu, Prabhu.
-We got a dying woman here!

05:11.562 --> 05:12.896
Prabhu. Prabhu.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.941
Hey. Hey, stop!

05:17.442 --> 05:19.486
Lin, stop! Enough!

06:11.580 --> 06:12.831
What did she say?

06:13.624 --> 06:15.042
It does not matter.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.002
I want to know.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.172
She asked for Ravi.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.106
They'll be back soon.

06:41.276 --> 06:43.445
How many huts have burned?

06:43.529 --> 06:46.657
Thirty. Mine included.

06:49.743 --> 06:50.953
Mom!

07:47.342 --> 07:50.512
I will go get some food and chai, okay?

07:50.596 --> 07:52.097
I'm not hungry.

07:52.764 --> 07:53.765
Lin.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.728
You were trying to do the best thing.
I know this. So you can--

07:57.811 --> 07:59.104
This was my fault.

08:01.732 --> 08:03.901
Prabhu, if I hadn't been here,
this fire would've never happened--

08:03.984 --> 08:05.736
Lin, please. Please.

08:08.906 --> 08:11.033
Fires, they happen here.

08:12.743 --> 08:16.121
You think I'm not hating
Lakshmi is gone, huh?

08:17.706 --> 08:18.832
This time, we are lucky.

08:18.916 --> 08:22.085
Last year, there was much bigger fire,
much more of the jhopadpatti was burned.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.712
More than 20 died.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.176
I will bring food, okay?

09:00.666 --> 09:02.459
Drop the-- Fuck. Fuck.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.711
Drop the clipboard and put your hands up.

09:04.795 --> 09:06.296
Get the fuck on.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.676
Don't touch
any fucking alarm buttons, all right?

09:10.759 --> 09:12.719
Could you ladies fill these bags up,
please?

09:12.803 --> 09:15.222
It's all insured.
It's really not worth worrying about.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.890
Just do what he says.

09:17.474 --> 09:20.060
-Please… Laura.
-Okay, okay, okay.

09:20.143 --> 09:21.854
Why don't you get a job,
you lazy bastards?

09:21.937 --> 09:25.399
Hey! Excuse me,
this is our job, you fat ass.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.734
Don't get in the way of us doing it,
all right?

09:27.818 --> 09:31.196
Come on, love. It's all good.
You just need to fill the bag.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.865
Can't you see she's terrified?

09:32.948 --> 09:34.491
Just fill the bag!

09:42.749 --> 09:45.043
Out of the way! Out of the way!
Move! Move!

09:50.966 --> 09:52.259
Watch it.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.178
Sorry, mate. My fault.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.975
Hey. Get off me.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.185
Drop the bloody gun.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.188
Get off me! Bastard. Drop the gun!

10:04.980 --> 10:06.315
Get the fuck off me.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.609
-Drop the gun! Drop it! Drop it!
-Okay. Okay. Okay!

10:15.490 --> 10:16.617
What did you do?

10:21.997 --> 10:23.290
Move.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.042
Dale.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.462
Dale, fucking move.

10:29.004 --> 10:31.006
Now. Come on.

10:32.007 --> 10:32.883
Dale.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.561
Somebody, call an ambulance.

10:46.021 --> 10:48.649
Okay. Hey, hey. Stay with me. Hey.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.901
You're all right, mate. You're all right.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.153
Stay with me.

10:53.237 --> 10:54.655
Get away from him!

11:33.694 --> 11:35.362
Salaam alaikum, Walidbhai.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.698
Alaikumu assalam, Khaderbhai.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.034
Interesting choice of location.

11:42.494 --> 11:46.790
Sad to think how many men
once earned a living here in better days.

11:46.874 --> 11:49.376
Arre, everything has its use-by date, huh?

11:49.960 --> 11:51.170
And everyone.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.883
Now, you wanted to talk.
This is where we can do it.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.729
Rujul Aadekar is dead.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.736
Had I been in your shoes,
I would have done exactly the same.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.822
All the companies are at peace.

12:18.906 --> 12:21.325
Our men are not killing
and shooting each other in the streets,

12:21.408 --> 12:22.910
and everyone is satisfied.

12:22.993 --> 12:25.329
The companies are at peace
because they're run by tired, old men

12:25.412 --> 12:26.663
who've settled for the status quo.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.123
Except yours?

12:28.207 --> 12:29.374
Except mine.

12:30.626 --> 12:33.587
Rujul, he believed you are weak, huh?

12:34.296 --> 12:37.508
Certainty of what is right
does not make anyone weak,

12:37.591 --> 12:41.595
or you'd still be running
the passport market in Colaba, not me.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.056
Is that what this is, Walid?

12:45.182 --> 12:48.435
You want to start a war
over your hurt pride?

12:48.519 --> 12:51.230
I'm not starting anything.
This is business, yaar.

12:52.147 --> 12:57.277
Sagar Wada is worth a fortune.
So, I simply made Rujul a better offer.

12:58.028 --> 13:00.197
I am not going to lose Sagar Wada.

13:00.948 --> 13:01.949
Is that a threat?

13:02.032 --> 13:05.035
A simple statement of fact.

13:06.537 --> 13:08.121
For you maybe, chachu, huh?

13:09.164 --> 13:13.252
You see, one man can say
his wife is beautiful,

13:13.335 --> 13:15.087
and another only sees a pig.

13:16.088 --> 13:19.842
You see, I think it is a simple fact
that I have more men and money than you.

13:19.925 --> 13:23.470
I think it is a simple fact
that women and drugs are the future,

13:24.304 --> 13:26.932
and yet you choose to stay in the past.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.519
You have to give the people
what they want, Khaderbhai.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.729
Otherwise, you are consigned to history.

13:40.404 --> 13:44.157
Maybe I'll build a big statue of you
at the gates of my Sagar Wada, huh?

13:48.871 --> 13:52.374
Always a pleasure talking with you,
Walidbhai.

14:18.859 --> 14:22.362
You're awake? Good. Come.
Something you gotta see, boss.

14:22.446 --> 14:24.239
All right. Just give me a minute.

14:25.157 --> 14:26.491
Come, na.

14:38.795 --> 14:39.796
Hey.

14:40.756 --> 14:41.965
What are they all doing?

14:43.759 --> 14:45.010
They're your patients.

14:46.345 --> 14:47.596
What are you talking about?

14:48.597 --> 14:50.849
They all know about
the doctoring you did last night,

14:50.933 --> 14:52.309
so now they wait to see you.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.394
No. No. I'm not--

14:55.229 --> 14:57.689
-Lin, no-- no problem waiting, Linbaba.
-I can't.

14:57.773 --> 15:00.692
They're here more than one hour already.
I told them you must sleep.

15:00.776 --> 15:01.777
Prabhu.

15:03.612 --> 15:06.323
Even if you were not here,
they would still be waiting

15:06.406 --> 15:08.200
but waiting for nothing only.

15:08.283 --> 15:09.493
And that kills the heart.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.787
But waiting for something,
that is different, na?

15:11.870 --> 15:15.499
I can't do that.
Look, I'm not even a doctor.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.253
Even bad doctor better than no doctor.

15:19.962 --> 15:23.048
I'm not saying you are bad,
only that if you were, it would be okay.

15:23.131 --> 15:25.467
Lin, please.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.680
-Prabhu.
-Lakshmi was going to die anyway.

15:30.389 --> 15:32.015
And we will grieve her.

15:33.308 --> 15:35.227
But that is how it is sometimes.

15:39.523 --> 15:41.984
-How are you, Prabhu?
-Okay.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.443
Mr. Lin.

15:43.527 --> 15:47.030
Look, I wanna say sorry about last night.
You were right. I should have listened.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.950
Qasim, is he going to help us?

16:04.506 --> 16:06.550
I wanted to run more than ever,

16:06.633 --> 16:10.596
take the second chance Karla's money
had given me and get out of Bombay,

16:10.679 --> 16:13.265
despite what helping me
had done to these people.

16:13.891 --> 16:15.517
It will be good, you'll see.

16:15.601 --> 16:16.768
God willing.

16:31.867 --> 16:34.411
This is a lot of money
to be giving away, Linbaba.

16:36.955 --> 16:39.041
Yeah, well,
I'm gonna need a lot of things.

16:39.541 --> 16:40.792
But why you do this?

16:41.460 --> 16:42.669
I've got my reasons.

16:44.046 --> 16:47.049
Go on, take it.
Use it to rebuild the homes that burned.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.093
Please.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.858
I will make sure
every paisa is well spent.

17:09.154 --> 17:12.281
All right! Just two more minutes. Okay?

17:14.326 --> 17:15.368
Okay.

17:30.551 --> 17:32.302
Put some of this on, all right?

17:32.386 --> 17:33.720
It had to be me.

17:34.805 --> 17:38.976
Another man with my training wouldn't
have been forced by crime into the slum.

17:41.937 --> 17:44.565
Another criminal wouldn't have had
my training.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.486
I didn't get the joke,
and fate didn't make me laugh.

17:50.863 --> 17:52.698
But I knew I couldn't leave.

18:03.584 --> 18:05.544
We have 20 more patients.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.296
Okay? Out. Okay.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.593
Let's go. Let's go.

18:12.676 --> 18:13.677
Hi.

18:35.616 --> 18:36.617
You need to eat.

18:46.919 --> 18:48.295
Breakfast of champions.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.964
You can be such a child sometimes.

18:51.465 --> 18:53.509
Are you angry with me
for helping you get clean?

18:56.303 --> 18:57.679
You're the one who's angry.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.642
Does it piss you off so much
that you have to look after me?

19:01.725 --> 19:03.769
I want you to look after yourself, Lisa.

19:03.852 --> 19:06.188
But you won't,
because you like being powerless,

19:06.271 --> 19:09.650
because it makes you the center
of whatever universe you happen to be in.

19:09.733 --> 19:11.860
Some people look after you
because they love you.

19:11.944 --> 19:13.320
That's not a bad thing.

19:14.780 --> 19:17.866
And what happens when they aren't there?

19:19.493 --> 19:21.703
You can't spend your life
refusing to care for anyone

19:21.787 --> 19:22.788
in case they leave.

19:22.871 --> 19:25.499
I can't do this, Lisa. Not now.

19:27.125 --> 19:30.337
I don't wanna fight with you,
not with everything else.

19:34.091 --> 19:35.092
I'm sorry.

19:38.887 --> 19:42.599
You're right.
I'm being a selfish, spoiled bitch.

19:45.561 --> 19:46.645
What is it?

19:50.607 --> 19:56.029
Yesterday, all I could think about
was not being weak.

19:58.323 --> 20:02.870
And now, I close my eyes,
and all I see is Rujul dead.

20:02.953 --> 20:04.162
Khader knew.

20:05.581 --> 20:07.958
He tried to protect me,
and the more he did,

20:09.501 --> 20:12.421
the more I was determined
to prove myself I could handle it.

20:13.964 --> 20:16.008
You don't have to prove anything, Karla.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.552
If I don't, the deal will fall apart.

20:18.635 --> 20:20.012
And would that be so bad?

20:22.347 --> 20:24.975
When is the last time
you let yourself go and felt happy?

20:26.894 --> 20:28.103
Truly happy?

20:31.690 --> 20:33.150
Let's be fucked-up together.

20:35.068 --> 20:38.655
I promise to eat some of this
and not be a royal pain in the ass,

20:38.739 --> 20:42.618
if you promise to stay here with me
and play records with me like old times

20:42.701 --> 20:44.411
until we run out of booze and hash.

20:47.789 --> 20:48.832
Okay.

21:02.513 --> 21:04.848
You are needing rest?
I can tell them to come back tomorrow.

21:04.932 --> 21:06.308
No, I'm good.

21:08.685 --> 21:11.480
Stop! Dr. Lin will be taking a break now.

21:15.609 --> 21:17.653
This is a thank-you, Dr. Lin.

21:18.904 --> 21:21.949
Well, it was actually Prabhu's idea.

21:22.032 --> 21:23.492
It was my idea.

21:24.368 --> 21:27.079
He talked Qasim Ali into it
and let me use his hut.

21:27.162 --> 21:29.122
I talked Qasim Ali into it.

21:29.831 --> 21:32.543
It was Prabhu who got all the supplies.

21:32.626 --> 21:33.752
I got the supplies.

21:35.671 --> 21:38.090
Prabhu,
this was a good thing that you did.

21:48.392 --> 21:50.477
You need help with patients?

21:51.812 --> 21:53.438
No. We're good, thank you.

21:55.065 --> 21:56.066
This is great, though.

22:01.780 --> 22:05.242
Very good, huh, Linbaba?
Very slick, very smooth,

22:05.826 --> 22:07.286
until you sent her away. Parvati!

22:11.498 --> 22:12.708
Thank you, huh?

22:14.543 --> 22:17.880
If you like, I will bring back your tray
when we are finished.

22:17.963 --> 22:18.964
At the chai shop.

22:22.134 --> 22:23.468
You'll be there?

22:25.345 --> 22:26.805
I'll be there.

22:41.111 --> 22:44.489
All right, what are you staring at?
Haven't you got work to do?

22:45.574 --> 22:46.658
Let's go.

22:48.952 --> 22:50.412
You are enjoying, huh?

22:51.079 --> 22:52.497
Yummy, yummy.

23:14.978 --> 23:18.065
The Palace operates
on an appointment-only basis.

23:18.148 --> 23:20.192
The Palace operates because we let it.

23:20.776 --> 23:22.528
Tell Zhou we're here. Go.

23:24.696 --> 23:28.075
I'm not some helpless girl, Padma,
that will bend to your discipline.

23:28.825 --> 23:31.203
You will need to leave
any weapons you carry here.

23:31.787 --> 23:33.580
No, I won't.

23:50.889 --> 23:55.686
This is an honor, Khaderbhai.
Can I get you something to drink or eat?

23:55.769 --> 23:58.689
Recently, I spent a solemn moment
with Rujul Aadekar.

23:59.273 --> 24:02.276
This morning,
I spent some time with Walid Shah.

24:03.193 --> 24:04.820
And now, I've come to see you.

24:05.571 --> 24:07.990
I do not approve of your business,

24:08.073 --> 24:10.534
but I understand
it is a business that must exist.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.036
So, you've been allowed
to come here and prosper.

24:14.204 --> 24:18.750
But there has been one condition
to your success. Neutrality.

24:22.337 --> 24:24.715
I made a mistake, Khaderbhai.

24:26.216 --> 24:27.885
I can only apologize.

24:29.595 --> 24:31.889
At first, I assumed you knew of it.

24:32.556 --> 24:35.976
When I realized this wasn't the case,
it was too late.

24:38.145 --> 24:41.690
As you say,
my position here in Bombay is vulnerable--

24:41.773 --> 24:44.401
You do not play the victim well, Madame.

24:45.819 --> 24:49.907
I hope you were better at faking
back when you were a mistress and a whore.

24:51.408 --> 24:54.745
Like I said, I made a mistake.

24:56.788 --> 24:58.999
But if I was going to die for it,

24:59.082 --> 25:03.212
I don't think you would come here yourself
to watch it happen.

25:03.795 --> 25:09.426
Dead, you are of no use to me.
Alive, maybe I could use you.

25:10.677 --> 25:14.264
Understand that when I leave this place,
I will take your life with me

25:14.848 --> 25:17.267
as collateral against the debt
that you now owe.

25:17.351 --> 25:20.187
And when I ask something of you,
you will do it,

25:20.270 --> 25:22.898
or this place will burn
as your funeral pyre.

25:28.695 --> 25:29.947
How did you know?

25:30.989 --> 25:32.741
Was it Karla Saaranen?

25:32.824 --> 25:33.825
Who?

25:34.618 --> 25:35.911
I do not know that name.

25:38.288 --> 25:40.123
Rujul belonged to me.

25:41.291 --> 25:43.335
I knew him better than he knew himself.

25:43.418 --> 25:47.214
So I had him followed,
where he went, what he did, who he saw.

25:47.923 --> 25:49.591
He was stupid to think otherwise.

25:49.675 --> 25:52.052
It was his stupidity that got him killed.

25:54.638 --> 25:56.473
I hope you're not stupid, Madame.

26:34.553 --> 26:39.057
Linbaba, we are now going
to build the pyre for Lakshmi's funeral

26:39.141 --> 26:40.726
if you want to come.

26:40.809 --> 26:43.645
I'm sorry, Johnny.
I got no right to be there.

26:45.314 --> 26:47.149
Prabhu told me you blame yourself.

26:49.193 --> 26:50.652
Prabhu talks too much.

26:52.821 --> 26:53.822
Yeah.

27:35.614 --> 27:39.952
Khaderbhai gave you your life today.
Is this wise?

27:40.035 --> 27:42.996
My life isn't any man's to give or take.

27:43.705 --> 27:46.250
I know their business as well as them.

27:46.333 --> 27:49.086
All these bhais… Fuck them.

27:50.254 --> 27:52.506
Maybe it's time for the behains, Padma.

27:57.719 --> 27:59.721
We had a deal, you and I.

28:00.430 --> 28:03.183
If you're talking about Lisa,
I kept my part of it.

28:03.267 --> 28:04.351
Lisa is gone.

28:05.310 --> 28:07.020
I don't see how that is my fault.

28:07.855 --> 28:09.898
Then why are you scared, Maurizio?

28:10.649 --> 28:11.650
I am not.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.151
I think you are.

28:16.572 --> 28:21.660
I think maybe it's the only time
when men and women can truly be the same,

28:22.160 --> 28:24.371
when they're powerless and terrified.

28:25.914 --> 28:29.209
But women are forced to feel it
so much more than men.

28:30.169 --> 28:32.754
By men, usually.

28:33.338 --> 28:34.339
Why am I here?

28:36.466 --> 28:38.802
There is a way for you to earn
my forgiveness.

28:40.846 --> 28:41.847
I'm listening.

28:43.015 --> 28:46.018
I want you to sell brown sugar for me
in Colaba.

28:48.896 --> 28:50.981
Colaba is Khaderbhai's territory.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.567
But he doesn't sell heroin there.

28:54.151 --> 28:55.736
Neither does anyone else.

28:55.819 --> 28:58.488
I owe him no loyalty. Do you?

28:58.572 --> 28:59.656
Me?

29:01.074 --> 29:02.326
I owe loyalty to no one.

29:03.535 --> 29:04.912
Which is honest, at least.

29:06.496 --> 29:07.915
My terms are simple.

29:08.498 --> 29:12.419
My name is never mentioned.
You keep 20% of the profit.

29:12.503 --> 29:14.755
Forty. I'm taking all of the risk.

29:14.838 --> 29:17.216
I'm not negotiating with you.

29:22.846 --> 29:24.640
How much are we talking about?

29:24.723 --> 29:28.101
I have access to as much Afghan dope
as you can sell.

29:32.564 --> 29:33.982
Okay then. You have a deal.

29:34.066 --> 29:36.026
Then you have nothing to fear.

29:42.699 --> 29:43.742
Mr. Lin?

29:50.290 --> 29:51.458
My name's Abdullah Taheri.

29:53.418 --> 29:55.045
I have someone who wants to meet you.

29:56.588 --> 29:59.299
Okay. Who is it?

30:00.676 --> 30:01.677
Please.

30:18.026 --> 30:19.444
Mr. Lindsay Ford?

30:21.029 --> 30:22.698
Just "Lin" works.

30:22.781 --> 30:25.367
I'm pleased to meet you.
I've heard good things.

30:25.450 --> 30:29.162
It's always nice to hear good things
about foreigners here in Bombay.

30:30.247 --> 30:34.001
You might have heard of me also.
My name is Abdel Khader Khan.

30:37.045 --> 30:39.882
So, you are the doctor
in the hutments now.

30:41.466 --> 30:44.178
Well, I'm--
I'm a long way from being a doctor.

30:44.261 --> 30:46.638
Well, maybe that is why
you are doing so well.

30:47.389 --> 30:50.309
Doctors do not go
into the jhopadpatti willingly.

30:50.392 --> 30:52.060
We can compel men not to be bad,

30:52.144 --> 30:55.022
but we cannot compel them to do good,
don't you find?

30:56.732 --> 30:59.109
I never really thought about it.

30:59.818 --> 31:01.778
I wonder what compels you.

31:03.780 --> 31:05.490
Is there something I can do for you?

31:05.574 --> 31:06.992
I don't know yet.

31:07.868 --> 31:09.203
That is why I am here,

31:09.286 --> 31:12.497
to invite you to spend some time with me
and my friend Abdullah.

31:17.753 --> 31:20.839
All right. I mean no offense,
but I'm just gonna say this.

31:22.090 --> 31:23.967
You have a fairly scary reputation.

31:24.051 --> 31:27.930
So you just turning up like this,
you can see why I might be a bit nervous

31:28.013 --> 31:31.099
about jumping in the back of your car
and letting you drive me away.

31:32.100 --> 31:35.687
I give you my word.
No harm will come to you this night.

31:37.189 --> 31:38.357
Do I have a choice?

31:38.440 --> 31:40.108
You always have a choice.

31:41.318 --> 31:44.863
In the end, I think that is all we have.

31:50.202 --> 31:51.203
Okay.

32:31.827 --> 32:33.245
So much for curfew.

32:33.328 --> 32:34.663
The authorities know

32:34.746 --> 32:40.043
that civilized people in large cities need
places to gather and hunt.

32:40.127 --> 32:45.007
So certain establishments are permitted
to pay a bribe, and order is preserved.

32:45.090 --> 32:47.968
Officially, the law remains.
It's just not enforced.

32:49.595 --> 32:52.639
Who gets to decide which laws get enforced
and which ones don't?

32:53.640 --> 32:58.145
Someone once said the worst thing
about corruption as a system of governance

32:58.228 --> 32:59.855
is that it works so well.

33:00.606 --> 33:01.607
Ramesh!

33:12.117 --> 33:13.493
How is your father?

33:13.577 --> 33:16.205
He is well, Khaderbhai. Thank you.

33:16.288 --> 33:18.624
But I am having a problem.

33:18.707 --> 33:19.750
Tell me.

33:19.833 --> 33:22.252
Bhai, it's about my landlord.

33:22.336 --> 33:24.463
He is demanding double rent already.

33:24.546 --> 33:29.843
He wants to evict us, not just me,
but all the families in my building.

33:29.927 --> 33:33.430
He has goondas,
and his goondas beat us badly.

33:33.514 --> 33:35.140
Even my own father.

33:36.183 --> 33:38.560
Then he is not well.

33:38.644 --> 33:42.940
No, sir.
He is too proud to ask you for help

33:43.023 --> 33:45.275
and doesn't want to disturb your peace.

33:45.359 --> 33:47.069
But I…

33:47.152 --> 33:49.446
You're a good son.

33:49.530 --> 33:51.907
We won't do anything to hurt his pride.

33:51.990 --> 33:54.576
And there will be no need
to speak to your father about this

33:54.660 --> 33:56.745
until the problem is solved, inshallah.

33:56.828 --> 33:58.705
-Thank you, thank--
-Okay, okay. Yes, yes, yes.

34:01.625 --> 34:03.126
How much did you understand?

34:05.629 --> 34:09.591
Not much.
Something about his home and his father.

34:10.342 --> 34:12.803
Their landlord wants them
out of their place.

34:12.886 --> 34:14.263
By force, if necessary.

34:15.472 --> 34:17.306
So you threaten
the man who threatens them?

34:18.141 --> 34:19.141
Do you approve?

34:20.726 --> 34:22.312
I don't think you need my approval.

34:23.730 --> 34:25.232
You're Abdel Khader Khan.

34:27.192 --> 34:30.821
Just because I can easily do something
doesn't always mean I should.

34:30.904 --> 34:33.447
Humor me. If it were you?

34:36.201 --> 34:39.871
I think if I liked Ramesh
and this landlord was out of line,

34:39.955 --> 34:41.581
then I'd do what I could for him.

34:41.665 --> 34:43.250
Even if it meant acting against the law?

34:44.168 --> 34:47.045
Who gets to choose which laws get enforced
and which ones don't?

34:52.759 --> 34:56.847
In the end, regardless of laws
or who chooses,

34:57.764 --> 35:02.186
each one of us, every atom in every galaxy
in every universe,

35:02.269 --> 35:04.062
is moving towards God.

35:06.899 --> 35:08.192
I don't believe in God.

35:09.776 --> 35:13.280
Then we have much more to talk about,
you and I.

35:14.364 --> 35:16.742
Let's go. We will take him to the club.

35:31.632 --> 35:35.219
-You said you'd stay with me.
-No. I just didn't say I wouldn't.

35:36.845 --> 35:38.055
Your deal.

35:38.138 --> 35:40.807
I've come too far, Lisa.
I don't have a choice.

35:41.892 --> 35:43.602
Can't disappoint Mr. Khader Khan.

35:47.814 --> 35:50.275
Stay. Please.

35:52.486 --> 35:53.612
For both of us.

35:54.571 --> 35:56.782
I can see what this is doing to you.
You know it too.

35:56.865 --> 35:58.283
You just won't admit it.

35:59.576 --> 36:02.412
Choose me. Stay with me.

36:04.706 --> 36:06.208
Because this matters the most.

36:08.961 --> 36:12.047
I care about you. You know that.

36:12.631 --> 36:14.132
But you're choosing him anyway.

37:10.939 --> 37:13.442
This club has the best ghazel singers
in Bombay.

37:14.109 --> 37:15.402
What are ghazels?

37:15.485 --> 37:18.488
Love songs. Love songs to God.

37:18.572 --> 37:22.284
No matter what you might think,
there is no believing in God.

37:22.868 --> 37:25.412
We either know him or we do not.

37:27.956 --> 37:32.002
Well, I don't know God,
but I think he's pretty much impossible.

37:32.711 --> 37:35.589
The fact that God is impossible
is proof he exists.

37:36.757 --> 37:39.092
So does that mean
that all possible things don't exist?

37:39.176 --> 37:41.053
I'm delighted you understand.

37:41.136 --> 37:42.888
I really don't.

37:42.971 --> 37:44.598
You're in trouble now, my friend.

37:44.681 --> 37:48.644
Nothing exists as we see it.
Our eyes are liars.

37:49.228 --> 37:51.146
Everything that seems real
is part of the illusion.

37:51.230 --> 37:52.648
You, me, this room.

37:54.691 --> 37:59.863
So if everything's an illusion,
how do we know what to do, how to live?

38:00.656 --> 38:01.740
We lie.

38:02.824 --> 38:05.786
The sane man is simply a better liar
than the insane man.

38:06.578 --> 38:08.163
Your eyes lie.

38:08.247 --> 38:11.834
What you think you know tells you
this is not so, but it's true.

38:12.626 --> 38:16.380
We prefer the lie because it's easier.

38:17.798 --> 38:19.132
That's how we stay sane?

38:21.093 --> 38:25.931
I am not married, and I have no sons.

38:26.640 --> 38:31.103
But if I tell you that I see it clearly
that you are my son,

38:31.603 --> 38:33.814
Abdullah is your brother,
I am your father,

38:33.897 --> 38:35.315
you will think that is impossible.

38:35.399 --> 38:38.735
You will resist it. You do. I see it.

38:39.570 --> 38:43.866
You prefer to believe the lie
that we are all strangers,

38:44.366 --> 38:46.451
and there is no connection between us.

38:48.579 --> 38:49.788
I have a father.

38:51.206 --> 38:53.709
And I don't know you. You don't know me.

38:54.501 --> 38:56.587
I think maybe I do.

39:00.507 --> 39:03.260
What do you lie to yourself about,
Mr. Lin?

39:05.846 --> 39:08.265
I don't. I'm finished with that.

39:09.933 --> 39:14.146
I know what I am,
what I've done, what I owe.

42:54.950 --> 42:56.535
How did you like the music?

42:56.618 --> 43:00.205
It's incredible.
I never heard anything like it before.

43:02.124 --> 43:03.667
Can I ask you something?

43:05.085 --> 43:07.713
All this, tonight…
Why'd you bring me here?

43:08.672 --> 43:10.048
What do you want from me?

43:13.677 --> 43:15.012
What are you doing here?

43:16.972 --> 43:19.349
Listening, drinking tea,

43:20.058 --> 43:22.644
learning that the world as I know it
is an illusion.

43:22.728 --> 43:24.062
I'm pretty stoned.

43:24.146 --> 43:25.981
You were meant to leave Bombay.

43:28.317 --> 43:30.027
Who is your friend, Mr. Lin?

43:30.110 --> 43:32.154
This is Karla Saaranen.

43:33.947 --> 43:34.823
Are we friends?

43:35.782 --> 43:36.950
I don't know.

43:37.576 --> 43:42.539
Let's just say Karla has had a full and
central part of my life in Bombay so far.

43:42.623 --> 43:43.707
Real or not.

43:43.790 --> 43:45.042
I think she's real.

43:46.460 --> 43:47.628
In fact,

43:49.338 --> 43:51.340
Karla proves that I'm right.

43:51.423 --> 43:53.592
If I invented her,
she would be a lot nicer to me.

43:54.718 --> 43:58.180
Karla, allow me to introduce
Abdullah Taheri,

43:58.263 --> 44:00.182
my brother from another mother,
apparently,

44:00.265 --> 44:04.686
recently reunited by my newest
acquaintance, Mr. Abdel Khader Khan.

44:04.770 --> 44:06.813
-You've probably heard of him.
-Of course.

44:06.897 --> 44:09.107
It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Saaranen.

44:09.191 --> 44:12.152
Likewise.
How do you all come to know each other?

44:12.236 --> 44:14.905
Fate saw fit to throw us together.

44:16.198 --> 44:17.533
Funny how that happens.

44:18.283 --> 44:21.453
Yeah, well, "Misery acquaints a man
with strange bedfellows."

44:21.537 --> 44:22.871
Who's the monster?

44:23.664 --> 44:24.831
What do you mean?

44:24.915 --> 44:27.417
That line is spoken by a man
who lies down with a monster.

44:27.501 --> 44:29.419
Ms. Saaranen knows her Shakespeare.

44:30.420 --> 44:31.505
Someone once told me

44:31.588 --> 44:34.174
that all the questions
and most of the answers in life

44:34.258 --> 44:35.717
can be found in Shakespeare.

44:37.052 --> 44:38.679
Would you like to join us?

44:38.762 --> 44:41.765
I can't. I've got guests of my own.

44:41.849 --> 44:44.935
We have business to conclude.
I should get back to them.

44:45.018 --> 44:46.311
Good luck with your business.

44:47.271 --> 44:48.272
Inshallah.

44:48.856 --> 44:50.858
Enjoy the rest of your evening, gentlemen.

46:04.556 --> 46:05.891
It has been a pleasure, Lin.

46:09.102 --> 46:10.521
Was this some kind of test?

46:11.688 --> 46:13.524
Why do you help in Sagar Wada?

46:15.901 --> 46:16.902
They needed it.

46:17.486 --> 46:18.820
An act of nobility then?

46:19.404 --> 46:22.658
Nah, there's nothing noble about me.
You can trust me on that.

46:23.408 --> 46:25.661
There are no good men or bad men.

46:25.744 --> 46:30.290
It is what they do, or refuse to do,
that makes them good or evil.

46:32.209 --> 46:34.169
This place means a great deal to me.

46:38.882 --> 46:41.051
Thank you for tonight, Mr. Khan.

46:41.134 --> 46:44.346
Please, call me Khaderbhai.

46:45.722 --> 46:46.723
Khaderbhai.

46:48.851 --> 46:49.935
Close enough.

46:56.984 --> 47:00.654
Maybe fate brought me together
with these men, father and brother.

47:01.488 --> 47:05.534
But everything that came after
was down to my own choices,

47:05.617 --> 47:07.160
just like Khader had said.

48:30.744 --> 48:33.664
You took her away.
You took my mother away.

48:34.957 --> 48:36.041
She was all I had.

48:38.752 --> 48:39.795
Yeah.

48:41.880 --> 48:43.715
I didn't mean to, but I did.

48:48.804 --> 48:53.058
I'm tired, Ravi, of getting it
so fucking wrong all the time.

48:55.769 --> 48:57.229
Are you gonna use that?

48:59.356 --> 49:00.607
Ravi!

49:01.984 --> 49:05.028
What are you doing, Ravi?

49:08.198 --> 49:09.741
Ravi, my son…

49:11.368 --> 49:12.953
Your mother is gone.

49:13.662 --> 49:18.041
Do this,
and you'll lose yourself forever also.

49:18.625 --> 49:20.043
Understand?

49:23.505 --> 49:24.965
This child does not deserve

49:25.048 --> 49:27.176
to carry your murder
on his conscience, Mr. Lin.

49:27.759 --> 49:29.928
And you are a selfish fool
for not knowing better.

49:35.475 --> 49:39.313
Go to my hut.
You will stay with my family now.

49:39.396 --> 49:41.064
No. Uncle Qasim, please.
I won't hurt him, but…

49:41.148 --> 49:45.235
Ravi. Do as I say.

49:45.319 --> 49:46.570
Go.

49:49.323 --> 49:50.866
What did you say to him?

49:51.450 --> 49:53.452
That he will stay with my family now.

49:56.663 --> 49:59.166
Lakshmi's hut will now be yours, Mr. Lin.

50:01.418 --> 50:05.130
When people here need your help,
this is where they will find you.

50:08.008 --> 50:09.801
This is not a gift I'm giving you.

50:11.762 --> 50:12.763
Yeah.
