after a stressful day.

I know you drank my last
Monster Energy drink!

01:23.458 --> 01:25.166
You ruined
my special plans.

01:25.166 --> 01:27.583
I was gonna drink it
after Francine went to sleep

01:27.583 --> 01:29.959
and make prank calls
all night long.

01:29.959 --> 01:31.333
It wasn't me.

My sensitive tummy
can't handle that stuff.

01:33.792 --> 01:35.709

01:38.583 --> 01:41.083
This was Baller's Blend Punch,
Steve!

Eh, he's just telling it

01:57.458 --> 02:01.333
Tomorrow we leave for our
annual trip to Possum Lake.

02:01.333 --> 02:03.834
All I have in my room
is a Burger King wrapper

02:03.834 --> 02:05.458
I taped to the wall.

02:05.458 --> 02:09.125
A wee bit of color
in my otherwise drab life.

02:09.125 --> 02:12.625
Yeah, at Possum Lake there are
all these father-son events --

02:12.625 --> 02:15.375
hot-dog-eating contest,
chicken fights,

02:15.375 --> 02:17.625
and a big boat race
at the end of the week.

02:17.625 --> 02:19.834
My dad is always so proud
of me up there

02:19.834 --> 02:21.667
because all we do is win.

02:21.667 --> 02:25.166
Geez, Steve, you're starting to
make me wish my dad wasn't dead.

02:25.166 --> 02:27.250
Oh you're really gonna wish
your dad wasn't dead

02:27.250 --> 02:28.542

02:28.542 --> 02:31.083
Up there,
we never have to shower.

02:31.083 --> 02:33.625
We just take some Pert Plus
into the lake.

02:33.625 --> 02:35.250

02:36.709 --> 02:39.709
Ew, you nasty.

02:43.208 --> 02:45.208

02:45.208 --> 02:46.542

written about you?

03:13.750 --> 03:15.792
No, I've come to realize
that I slept

03:15.792 --> 03:17.667
with a different
Richard Sambora.

03:17.667 --> 03:20.750
Well, I couldn't be more
excited for Possum Lake.

I've been able to make the trip.

Wanna lay out and

03:33.625 --> 03:35.875
Hey, I have an idea
for a film adaptation

03:35.875 --> 03:38.166

You wanna hear about it?

03:38.166 --> 03:39.458
Of course.

are used only for sex.

10:38.250 --> 10:39.792
The only thing
that really matters

10:39.792 --> 10:41.667
is the big boat race
tomorrow.

10:41.667 --> 10:43.333
We bring home that trophy,

10:43.333 --> 10:45.375
then we're still
the real winners, right, Dad?

10:45.375 --> 10:47.667
Absolutely.
And we're going to win for sure.

know how to sail.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.208

11:09.208 --> 11:11.417
we have to break up
Snot and Tuttle.

11:11.417 --> 11:14.208
We can't do that.
Snot's your best friend.

-Good.

and Snot, didn't you?

12:07.417 --> 12:09.792
I did what had to be done.

12:09.792 --> 12:12.458
I broke them up with a page

more appealing son than Snot.

The rest was easy.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.166
Tuttle: I turn on my computer.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.583
I go online.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.625
And my breath catches
in my chest

three little words...

have discovered

12:44.041 --> 12:46.083
the best way to meet someone

12:46.083 --> 12:48.750
is to never meet at all.

12:58.917 --> 13:02.125
is that one of them
is just a huge dick.

Snot found all
the secret e-mails,

13:28.542 --> 13:30.208
and now they're
in a huge fight.

this is The Possum Lake
Boat Race.

14 hours?

14:30.208 --> 14:31.709

15:04.041 --> 15:06.291
by the Possum Lake
monster!

15:06.291 --> 15:08.458
Old Ulysses
from the song?

15:08.458 --> 15:10.917
No, this was
a land-based monster

15:10.917 --> 15:13.458
whose song has yet
to be written.

15:13.458 --> 15:15.709
It had a big, swollen head.

15:15.709 --> 15:18.417
No nose.
Droopy witch-belly.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.625
Long, probing fingers.

15:20.625 --> 15:25.709
I'll never forget the disgusting
feel of that gray, papery skin.

15:25.709 --> 15:27.542
Okay, that's enough.

15:27.542 --> 15:29.041
You can't blame this poor,

15:29.041 --> 15:31.625
land-based monster
for the dry mountain air.

15:31.625 --> 15:34.125
And "monster", that's a bit
of a loaded word, isn't it?

15:34.125 --> 15:36.500
The words we use matter.
-But it attacked him.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.291
Oh, don't be such a stupid
bitch, Barbara.

15:38.291 --> 15:40.500
I won't apologize.

15:40.500 --> 15:43.375
I think this two-day
bike lesson is over.

15:43.375 --> 15:46.375
You think this is over?
This is far from over!

15:46.375 --> 15:49.792
Because this land-based monster
never forgets.

15:49.792 --> 15:51.542
That's right,
I'm admitting it.

15:51.542 --> 15:53.917
And you fools
made a terrible mistake --

15:53.917 --> 15:56.417
you taught the monster
to ride a bike.
