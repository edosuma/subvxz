00:02.570 --> 00:03.920
<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...
Who is Amber?

00:04.120 --> 00:04.980
A girl I'm seeing.

00:05.180 --> 00:06.220
(quietly):
Does Mandy know?

00:06.420 --> 00:07.790
It was actually
her idea.

00:07.990 --> 00:09.690
How was your date?

00:09.890 --> 00:11.160
We broke up.

00:11.360 --> 00:12.690
What happened?

00:12.890 --> 00:14.160
I just wanted
to be here.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.250
That's what
we wanted, too.

00:17.010 --> 00:19.300
There's something else
you could do for my birthday.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.770
I had a baby
two weeks ago, no.

00:21.970 --> 00:23.200
Not that.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.170
Then what?

00:25.370 --> 00:27.460
Marry me.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.510
What?!

00:34.710 --> 00:35.510
(cooing)

00:35.710 --> 00:36.920
What?

00:37.120 --> 00:39.820
Will you marry...
Yeah,
I heard the question.

00:40.020 --> 00:41.840
Why are you asking it?

00:42.670 --> 00:43.920
Well, 'cause I love you.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.740
(scoffs)
Do ya?

00:46.540 --> 00:47.660
I think so.

00:47.860 --> 00:49.760
You were just on a date
with another girl.

00:49.960 --> 00:51.700
Yeah, and I could be
at her place right now,

00:51.900 --> 00:53.130
but instead,
I'm here with you.

00:53.330 --> 00:55.330
Oh, well, thank you
for your sacrifice.

00:55.530 --> 00:57.000
I'm 18 years old--
believe me,

00:57.200 --> 00:58.540
that's a sacrifice.
(Constance crying)

00:58.740 --> 01:01.690
Oh, great.
Are you happy?

01:02.990 --> 01:04.240
Maybe she's crying
because her mom

01:04.440 --> 01:05.410
don't want to marry
her dad.

01:05.610 --> 01:06.680
Or maybe she's crying

01:06.880 --> 01:08.500
'cause her mom wants to
strangle her dad.

01:09.330 --> 01:11.080
Hey there, birthday boy.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.190
What're you doing home
so early?

01:12.390 --> 01:13.820
Apparently,
wasting my time.

01:14.020 --> 01:17.360
You cannot just show up here
and spring a proposal on me.

01:17.560 --> 01:18.620
You proposed?

01:18.820 --> 01:21.230
Don't worry.
It won't happen again.

01:21.430 --> 01:23.610
* *

01:28.220 --> 01:29.900
So, when's
the wedding?

01:30.100 --> 01:31.240
* *

01:31.440 --> 01:33.840
* Nobody else
is stronger than I am *

01:34.040 --> 01:36.640
* Yesterday I moved a mountain *

01:36.840 --> 01:39.150
* I bet I could be your hero *

01:39.350 --> 01:42.250
* I am a mighty little man *

01:42.450 --> 01:46.840
* <i>I am a mighty little man.</i> *

01:49.100 --> 01:50.390
KIRK (over TV):
<i>They'll want to do the same.</i>

01:50.590 --> 01:51.890
Only the next attack they launch

01:52.090 --> 01:53.190
will do a lot more

01:53.390 --> 01:54.390
than just count up numbers
on a computer.

01:54.590 --> 01:55.690
What are you doing?

01:55.890 --> 01:57.810
Dad and I are watching
<i>Star Trek.</i>

01:58.480 --> 01:59.470
(snoring)

01:59.670 --> 02:01.300
I guess I'm watching <i>Star Trek.</i>

02:01.500 --> 02:03.140
Want me to watch with you?

02:03.340 --> 02:04.650
Sure.
Let me catch you up.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.910
The <i>Enterprise</i> is
traveling to Eminiar VII

02:08.110 --> 02:10.410
to resolve their war with
the neighboring Vendikar.

02:10.610 --> 02:12.310
Uh-huh.
But Kirk suspects

02:12.510 --> 02:13.580
that instead of
having a real war,

02:13.780 --> 02:15.480
the Eminiaries
and the Vendikaries

02:15.680 --> 02:18.180
are having a
computer-simulated conflict.

02:18.380 --> 02:19.190
Uh-huh.

02:19.390 --> 02:20.590
In Kirk's opinion,

02:20.790 --> 02:21.820
by keeping the horrors of war
at arm's length,

02:22.020 --> 02:23.540
they're simply
prolonging it.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.590
Let me ask you something.

02:25.790 --> 02:27.430
Answers are my thing.
Go for it.

02:27.630 --> 02:30.830
Do you really believe in
all this space alien stuff?

02:31.030 --> 02:32.970
Well, it's simple
probability theory.

02:33.170 --> 02:34.900
There are over a hundred
billion stars in our galaxy.

02:35.100 --> 02:36.970
So it's likely that a few of
them could support life,

02:37.170 --> 02:39.360
or even technological
civilization.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.910
And did Jesus die
for their sins as well?

02:43.110 --> 02:45.080
You have your stories,
I have mine.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.510
(door closes)

02:46.710 --> 02:48.450
Whew. Sounds like
Georgie's home.

02:48.650 --> 02:50.720
George, wake up.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.970
Watch <i>Star Trek</i>
with your son.

02:55.070 --> 02:56.050
(door closes)

02:56.260 --> 02:57.620
(exhales)
What's happening?

02:57.820 --> 02:59.990
Well, the <i>Enterprise</i> is
traveling to Eminiar VII

03:00.190 --> 03:02.090
to resolve their war with
the neighboring Vendikar.

03:02.300 --> 03:03.630
However, Kirk suspects that

03:03.830 --> 03:05.030
instead of fighting
a real war,

03:05.230 --> 03:06.570
the Eminiaries
and the Vendikaries

03:06.770 --> 03:08.270
are fighting a
computer-simulated conflict.

03:08.470 --> 03:10.400
Uh-uh. Stay awake.
I'm awake.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.520
Georgie?
GEORGE JR.: What?

03:14.490 --> 03:15.860
Hey!

03:16.790 --> 03:19.480
I just want to wish you
a happy birthday.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.110
Thanks.

03:21.310 --> 03:23.830
(sighs)
Everything okay?

03:24.630 --> 03:25.750
I don't want to
talk about it.

03:25.950 --> 03:28.500
You and Amber have a fight?

03:30.140 --> 03:31.220
We broke up.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.290
Oh, no.

03:33.490 --> 03:34.390
I'm sorry.

03:34.590 --> 03:35.910
Well...

03:37.210 --> 03:40.870
Maybe it's a good thing because
you and Mandy and CeeCee

03:41.070 --> 03:43.300
make such a cute
little family.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.170
Mm-hmm.
You know, I see the way

03:45.370 --> 03:46.340
she's been looking at you.

03:46.540 --> 03:47.840
Stop.
I mean it.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.610
I think she's ready to
give you another chance.

03:50.810 --> 03:53.780
Yeah, maybe I should just
ask her to marry me.

03:53.980 --> 03:55.110
Well...
(chuckling)

03:55.310 --> 03:57.770
you don't want to scare her off.

04:00.770 --> 04:01.950
(clears throat)

04:02.150 --> 04:03.960
* *

04:04.160 --> 04:05.840
You're up early.

04:07.210 --> 04:09.800
Georgie usually comes over
and feeds her in the morning.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.160
But I think he's mad at me.

04:11.360 --> 04:14.900
Yeah, you reject a guy's
marriage proposal,

04:15.100 --> 04:16.470
they tend to
take it personal.

04:16.670 --> 04:18.990
You speaking from experience?

04:19.790 --> 04:22.220
I've broken a couple of
hearts in my day.

04:26.230 --> 04:28.050
He just caught me off guard.
That's all.

04:28.250 --> 04:30.780
And now that you've had time,
what do you think?

04:30.980 --> 04:33.270
Why does it have to be
all or nothing?

04:34.600 --> 04:36.120
I get that he's mad at me.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.320
I just didn't think he'd stop
showing up for his daughter.

04:38.520 --> 04:41.530
Oh, he'll come around.
He just needs to cool off.

04:41.730 --> 04:43.680
* *

04:45.450 --> 04:47.300
Let me ask. Mom,

04:47.500 --> 04:49.200
can I go to the movies
on Saturday?

04:49.400 --> 04:50.340
Sure.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.040
She said yes.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.820
Okay, it's a date.

04:56.590 --> 04:57.480
Who was that?

04:57.680 --> 04:59.230
Britney Perkins.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.950
She that, uh, chunky one
with the headgear?

05:03.150 --> 05:06.940
No, she's a cheerleader
and her teeth are beautiful.

05:07.940 --> 05:08.950
Oh.

05:09.150 --> 05:11.660
And... and she asked you out.

05:11.860 --> 05:13.710
<i>(knock at door)</i>

05:14.980 --> 05:17.330
What do you know about
Britney Perkins?

05:17.530 --> 05:19.650
That's her right there.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.740
(exhales softly)
She's cute.

05:22.940 --> 05:24.840
And this was before
her boobs came in.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.640
So, she's just
messing with Billy?

05:27.840 --> 05:30.140
She might've
asked him out.

05:30.340 --> 05:32.240
Okay, she's
messing with him.

05:32.450 --> 05:33.780
You friends
with this girl?

05:33.980 --> 05:37.120
(scoffs) I wish.
She is so popular.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.880
One time she said
she liked my outfit--

05:39.080 --> 05:40.550
I wore it for a week.

05:40.750 --> 05:43.420
(scoffs)
What am I gonna do?

05:43.620 --> 05:45.640
(both sighing)

05:46.940 --> 05:49.080
You could tell Billy
he's too young to date.

05:50.410 --> 05:52.450
(chuckles softly)
That's good.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.800
You might be the coolest
person in this house.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.090
Low bar, but thanks.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.640
Dr. Linkletter,
I need to talk to you.

06:01.840 --> 06:03.380
Are we in my office?

06:03.580 --> 06:04.580
No.

06:04.780 --> 06:06.310
Then these are not
my office hours.

06:06.510 --> 06:08.680
Are you using my love of
schedules against me?

06:08.880 --> 06:10.120
(chuckling):
Oh, yes.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.020
Well done.

06:12.220 --> 06:14.200
* *

06:22.380 --> 06:25.530
Dr. Linkletter,
I need to talk to you.
Great.

06:25.730 --> 06:26.600
Do you think you could
get me access

06:26.800 --> 06:27.800
to the telescope room?

06:28.000 --> 06:28.900
I want to search for
exoplanets

06:29.100 --> 06:30.370
that could support life.

06:30.570 --> 06:31.850
Are you feeling homesick?

06:32.620 --> 06:35.140
Are you implying that
I'm from another planet?
Yes.

06:35.340 --> 06:36.340
Compliment accepted.

06:36.540 --> 06:37.810
Now, about the telescope room,

06:38.010 --> 06:39.650
I was watching <i>Star Trek</i>
and it got me thinking...

06:39.850 --> 06:41.150
Sheldon,
searching for life

06:41.350 --> 06:43.680
on other planets
isn't serious science.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.450
Leave that to the
tinfoil hat brigade.

06:45.650 --> 06:48.220
But statistically, given
the number of stars and planets,

06:48.420 --> 06:50.590
it's likely we could find one
capable of supporting life.

06:50.790 --> 06:51.820
And if we did,
it would be the greatest

06:52.020 --> 06:52.990
scientific discovery
of all time.

06:53.190 --> 06:54.530
Yes, and if I had
fruit on my head,

06:54.730 --> 06:56.030
I'd be Carmen Miranda.

06:56.230 --> 06:57.460
I'm not familiar with
that reference.

06:57.660 --> 06:59.700
She sang and danced
with fruit on her head.

06:59.900 --> 07:01.170
Why would she have
fruit on her head?

07:01.370 --> 07:02.840
I don't know,
in case she got hungry.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.470
It's not gonna happen,
Sheldon!

07:04.670 --> 07:06.940
How can you just dismiss
a line of inquiry out of hand?

07:07.140 --> 07:09.840
Sheldon, sometimes
I say no just for kicks.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.110
This time it's for
your own good.

07:11.310 --> 07:12.810
Scientists who pursue
little green men

07:13.010 --> 07:14.280
get laughed at.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.310
Well, I care about science,
not my reputation.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.580
And if you're not
willing to help me,

07:17.780 --> 07:18.650
I know someone who is.

07:18.850 --> 07:21.820
We'll be mocked by physicists,

07:22.020 --> 07:24.990
engineers,
even mathematicians.

07:25.190 --> 07:27.760
And they don't just say
you're an idiot--

07:27.960 --> 07:29.190
they prove it.

07:29.390 --> 07:31.730
And if I had fruit on my head,
I'd be Carmen Miranda.

07:31.930 --> 07:33.070
What?

07:33.270 --> 07:35.180
I didn't understand it either.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.980
* *

07:44.180 --> 07:45.940
Hey.
Hi.

07:46.140 --> 07:48.650
Are you okay?
No.

07:48.850 --> 07:50.220
Britney Perkins asked me
to go to the movies,

07:50.420 --> 07:51.520
but my mom says
I'm not allowed to date

07:51.720 --> 07:52.750
because I'm too young.

07:52.950 --> 07:55.900
I'm sure she's just
looking out for you.

07:56.970 --> 07:59.730
Maybe I could sneak out
and still go with her.

07:59.930 --> 08:00.760
Don't do that.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.390
You sneak out of
your house.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.860
Because I'm a troubled kid.
You're not.

08:05.060 --> 08:08.880
But this is the first time
a girl's ever asked me out.

08:09.890 --> 08:10.800
(sighs)

08:11.000 --> 08:12.400
Billy, she doesn't like you.

08:12.610 --> 08:13.740
What do you mean?

08:13.940 --> 08:16.210
She's having a party at
her house on Saturday.

08:16.410 --> 08:18.280
She's not going
to the movies.

08:18.480 --> 08:19.830
It's a prank.

08:20.830 --> 08:22.500
Oh.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.920
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.420
(scoffs)

08:27.620 --> 08:28.920
I'll go to the movies
with you.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.220
You don't have to
do that.

08:30.420 --> 08:32.090
I want to.
It'll be fun.

08:32.290 --> 08:34.230
But aren't you going
to her party?

08:34.430 --> 08:35.760
I wasn't invited.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.900
Which is fine,
'cause she's a bitch.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.700
Wow.
You are troubled.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.820
* *

08:44.320 --> 08:45.500
(knock at door)

08:45.700 --> 08:47.590
President Hagemeyer,
we have a problem.

08:48.560 --> 08:49.680
What now, Sheldon?

08:49.880 --> 08:51.110
The Yoo-hoos
in the vending machine

08:51.310 --> 08:52.180
aren't cold enough?

08:52.380 --> 08:53.310
Actually, they aren't,

08:53.510 --> 08:54.250
but we'll table that
for later.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.680
I need telescope time

08:55.880 --> 08:57.480
to search for exoplanets,
and Dr. Linkletter

08:57.680 --> 08:59.150
and Dr. Sturgis have
denied my request.

08:59.350 --> 09:01.750
Why?
They said that kind of
research would expose both

09:01.950 --> 09:03.460
me and the university
to criticism.

09:03.660 --> 09:05.460
(stifled laugh)
Well, that's outrageous.

09:05.660 --> 09:06.990
So, you'll give me access?

09:07.190 --> 09:09.330
Gosh, no.
I want to, but...

09:09.530 --> 09:11.760
I'm just the president.
(chuckles)

09:11.960 --> 09:16.940
Use of the telescope has to be
approved by a science advisor.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.070
Is that true?

09:18.270 --> 09:19.470
Does it sound true?

09:19.670 --> 09:22.010
I suppose it does.
Then I suppose it is.

09:22.210 --> 09:23.740
Why did I even come to you?

09:23.940 --> 09:25.880
(gasps)
Remember that next time.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.710
Mm.

09:27.910 --> 09:28.980
* *

09:29.180 --> 09:30.650
(cooing)

09:30.850 --> 09:34.090
Just a warning, she's gonna
get some shots today.

09:34.290 --> 09:35.520
Okay, kid.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.490
You don't cry,
I don't cry.

09:37.690 --> 09:39.740
Actually, I'm gonna cry
either way, but you don't cry.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.160
Hey.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.100
Wasn't sure
you were coming.

09:44.300 --> 09:45.500
Well, I'm here.

09:45.700 --> 09:46.970
You must be Mr. McAllister.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.640
She's McAllister.
I'm Cooper.
Can you not?

09:49.840 --> 09:51.500
Well, I just don't want her
to think we're married.

09:51.700 --> 09:53.240
I know how embarrassing
that'd be for you.

09:53.440 --> 09:54.910
That is not what I said.

09:55.110 --> 09:56.410
We're not married.

09:56.610 --> 09:57.980
Really not my business.

09:58.180 --> 09:59.240
It might be.

09:59.440 --> 10:00.810
You're a pediatrician,
he's being a child.

10:01.010 --> 10:03.050
How does wanting us to be
a family make me a child?

10:03.250 --> 10:04.950
You really want to have this
fight in front of a stranger?

10:05.150 --> 10:07.650
Married people fight
all the time, right?

10:07.850 --> 10:09.450
Uh...
You don't have to
answer that.

10:09.650 --> 10:10.660
And no, they don't.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.860
Actually...
I said don't answer.

10:13.060 --> 10:14.540
* *

10:15.740 --> 10:18.530
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>While it was nice to have</i>
<i>President Hagemeyer on my side,</i>

10:18.730 --> 10:19.930
<i>I still needed to find</i>

10:20.130 --> 10:22.000
<i>an advisor to approve</i>
<i>my research.</i>

10:22.200 --> 10:24.200
<i>Some intrepid soul</i>
<i>who was unafraid of</i>

10:24.400 --> 10:26.740
<i>tarnishing their reputation</i>
<i>by taking a chance</i>

10:26.940 --> 10:29.340
<i>on a brilliant mind</i>
<i>and a bold, untested idea.</i>

10:29.540 --> 10:30.680
("Go Away"
by Gloria Estefan playing)

10:30.880 --> 10:32.340
No.

10:32.540 --> 10:34.050
* Go away *
No.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.280
Exoplanets?

10:36.480 --> 10:38.880
(chuckling)
Nah...

10:39.080 --> 10:40.590
No.

10:40.790 --> 10:42.550
Dr. Evans, I have...
No.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.690
* Leave right now... *

10:44.890 --> 10:46.990
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Eight noes, three belly laughs,</i>

10:47.190 --> 10:49.900
<i>and one professor who pretended</i>
<i>not to speak English later,</i>

10:50.100 --> 10:51.430
<i>I found my man.</i>

10:51.630 --> 10:53.300
* Go away. *
Excuse me, Dr. Prakash?

10:53.500 --> 10:54.370
I'm Sheldon Cooper.
Of course.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.200
I've heard
a lot about you.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.570
And I've heard
nothing about you.

10:57.770 --> 10:58.840
Dr. Prakash,
I'm on the hunt

10:59.040 --> 11:00.840
for a mentor who's
not afraid to challenge

11:01.040 --> 11:02.610
entrenched
scientific paradigms.

11:02.810 --> 11:04.480
Well, mainstream science
has always been threatened

11:04.680 --> 11:05.710
by new ideas.

11:05.910 --> 11:07.980
True. Like Galileo
being imprisoned

11:08.180 --> 11:09.980
for his heliocentric model
of the universe.

11:10.180 --> 11:11.920
And did you know Semmelweis
was put in an asylum

11:12.120 --> 11:13.990
for suggesting that doctors
wash their hands?

11:14.190 --> 11:16.150
I did. Did you know that
Michael Servetus discovered

11:16.350 --> 11:18.460
pulmonary circulation
and was burned at the stake?

11:18.660 --> 11:19.890
Or Henry Oldenburg
was arrested...

11:20.090 --> 11:21.330
Arrested as a spy for
corresponding with scientists

11:21.530 --> 11:22.800
from other countries!

11:23.000 --> 11:25.230
This isn't
a competition.

11:25.430 --> 11:27.200
Oh, I thought
we were bonding.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.470
Fair enough.
We're bonding.

11:29.670 --> 11:31.340
How would you feel
about joining me

11:31.540 --> 11:33.170
in the groundbreaking
search for exoplanets

11:33.370 --> 11:34.210
that could support life?

11:34.410 --> 11:35.470
I'd love it.

11:35.670 --> 11:36.680
How would you feel
about joining me

11:36.880 --> 11:37.780
in finding
subatomic particles

11:37.980 --> 11:38.780
that move
backwards in time?

11:38.980 --> 11:40.150
You mean tachyons?
Yes.

11:40.350 --> 11:42.870
That's nonsense.
Let's get started on my thing.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.120
(clears throat)

11:45.320 --> 11:46.550
You should know,

11:46.750 --> 11:48.620
I'm replacing you with
a more courageous mentor.

11:48.820 --> 11:50.890
I'm sorry to hear that,
Sheldon.

11:51.090 --> 11:52.890
One who's not afraid
of new ideas.

11:53.090 --> 11:54.030
Great.

11:54.230 --> 11:55.290
Don't think of it
as me walking away,

11:55.490 --> 11:57.300
think of it as
you being left behind.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.300
I'm okay with that.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.500
Thank you for helping me
on my journey.

12:00.700 --> 12:01.630
But you're like
a rocket booster

12:01.830 --> 12:02.770
that must be discarded

12:02.970 --> 12:04.370
for me to reach
escape velocity.

12:04.570 --> 12:06.100
I understand.

12:06.300 --> 12:07.170
I'm walking away now.

12:07.370 --> 12:08.170
Goodbye.

12:08.370 --> 12:09.510
I'm walking backwards,

12:09.710 --> 12:11.240
so it seems like you're
fading into obscurity.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.240
Neat.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.510
Take care.

12:13.710 --> 12:14.850
Farewell.

12:15.050 --> 12:16.250
Ciao.

12:16.450 --> 12:18.320
Bon voyage.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.540
Arrivederci.

12:22.870 --> 12:24.920
What a charming
young man.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.320
Kook.

12:26.520 --> 12:28.330
(phone rings)

12:28.530 --> 12:29.590
Hello?

12:29.790 --> 12:32.150
Oh, hi, Britney.
What's up?

12:33.420 --> 12:34.680
Saturday?

12:35.420 --> 12:37.520
Well, actually...

12:38.690 --> 12:40.870
I'm totally free, thanks.

12:41.070 --> 12:42.220
You're the best.

12:45.630 --> 12:47.800
Maybe I'm the bitch.

12:49.600 --> 12:50.750
Why would you tell the doctor

12:50.950 --> 12:52.550
I got pregnant when you were 17?

12:52.750 --> 12:54.950
She asked what our history was.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.290
Medical history!

12:56.490 --> 12:59.040
That was unclear.
(scoffs)

13:04.250 --> 13:05.360
Oh, no.

13:05.560 --> 13:07.030
This is bad. I locked
the keys in the car.

13:07.230 --> 13:10.220
But the baby's in there.
And now you know
why it's bad!

13:18.060 --> 13:19.640
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

13:19.840 --> 13:21.650
It's gonna be fine.
How is it fine?

13:21.850 --> 13:23.280
It's okay,
I'll break the window.

13:23.480 --> 13:24.520
Glass'll go everywhere.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.120
Right! See,
you are a good mom.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.420
(sighs) Okay.

13:29.620 --> 13:31.020
CeeCee, it's okay.

13:31.220 --> 13:33.660
We got to stay calm.
Don't let her see us panic.
Right.

13:33.860 --> 13:35.640
Happy faces.

13:36.510 --> 13:38.600
Hey, baby, this is normal.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.830
We're all okay.

13:40.030 --> 13:41.670
We're gonna
get you out.

13:41.870 --> 13:43.040
How're we gonna
get her out?

13:43.240 --> 13:44.540
I don't know.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.540
Wait, I got a bunch of hangers
from the laundromat in my car.

13:46.740 --> 13:47.670
I can pick the lock.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.120
Go get them!

13:53.000 --> 13:55.380
Who has the dumbest mommy
in the world?

13:55.580 --> 13:58.930
You do.
Yes, you do.

14:02.070 --> 14:03.690
So, where exactly is
the telescope?

14:03.890 --> 14:06.910
Hawaii.
We just access its data.
Ah.

14:08.440 --> 14:09.630
And what are we looking for?

14:09.830 --> 14:10.960
Well, you're looking for
these numbers here

14:11.160 --> 14:12.560
to change--
that would indicate

14:12.760 --> 14:14.130
that the star is dimming,
possibly because

14:14.330 --> 14:16.300
an orbiting planet is
passing in front of it.

14:16.500 --> 14:17.820
Mm-hmm.

14:19.190 --> 14:21.220
* *

14:24.360 --> 14:25.730
(chuckles softly)

14:31.130 --> 14:33.240
<i>Star Trek</i> made this
seem a lot more fun.

14:34.640 --> 14:35.490
(sportscast playing on TV)

14:35.690 --> 14:36.970
(sighs)

14:37.840 --> 14:39.060
Can I get some advice?

14:39.260 --> 14:41.510
Mm. What's up?

14:42.280 --> 14:45.060
I made plans with a friend,
but then I got the chance

14:45.260 --> 14:47.470
to do something way cooler
with another friend.

14:47.670 --> 14:50.740
So, you want to ditch the first
friend for someone else?

14:50.940 --> 14:53.010
Not ditch so much
as reschedule.

14:53.210 --> 14:54.870
(sighs)

14:55.070 --> 14:56.610
I think
you know the answer.

14:56.810 --> 14:59.810
You're right.
Thanks, Dad.

15:00.010 --> 15:02.280
And I never would've agreed
to the first friend

15:02.480 --> 15:04.150
if I knew the second friend
was gonna call.

15:04.350 --> 15:06.430
I think you know
what you have to do.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.650
What if it's one
of those times

15:08.850 --> 15:12.110
where I actually have to make
the mistake to learn from it?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.040
(exhales)

15:16.840 --> 15:18.900
Mom, can I get
your opinion on something?

15:19.100 --> 15:20.930
Of course, sweetie.

15:21.130 --> 15:24.750
I'm not just your mother,
I'm also your friend.

15:30.060 --> 15:32.180
Damn it.
It's okay,
you got this.

15:32.380 --> 15:33.710
Come on.

15:33.910 --> 15:35.680
Come on...
Got it.

15:35.880 --> 15:36.780
Oh, thank you!

15:36.980 --> 15:38.820
Hi, CeeCee.

15:39.020 --> 15:40.190
Mommy's here.

15:40.390 --> 15:43.120
You're such
a brave little girl. Hi.

15:43.320 --> 15:44.990
The good news is she ain't
gonna remember any of this.

15:45.190 --> 15:48.130
And we don't have to
tell a soul.

15:48.330 --> 15:49.560
Pinky swear?

15:49.760 --> 15:51.050
Done.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.100
And while we're swearing,

15:53.300 --> 15:55.000
let's promise not to fight
in front of her anymore.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.350
Promise.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.440
And, uh, the next time
you're gonna propose,

15:59.640 --> 16:00.570
give me
a little warning.

16:00.770 --> 16:02.040
You got it.
Okay.

16:02.240 --> 16:03.410
(cooing)

16:03.610 --> 16:04.540
Mandy McAllister...

16:04.740 --> 16:06.160
Oh, not now!

16:06.960 --> 16:09.080
Billy,
can I ask you something?

16:09.280 --> 16:10.180
Yeah.

16:10.380 --> 16:12.320
If Britney invited you
to her party,

16:12.520 --> 16:14.550
would you want go to that
instead of the movies with me?

16:14.750 --> 16:16.200
No.

16:16.970 --> 16:18.910
(sighs)
Right.

16:19.710 --> 16:21.430
Wait...
did I get invited?

16:21.630 --> 16:23.030
No.

16:23.230 --> 16:25.730
Oh.
She invited you.

16:25.930 --> 16:27.820
Yeah.

16:29.450 --> 16:30.300
You should go.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.100
No, we have plans.

16:32.300 --> 16:33.340
That's okay.

16:33.540 --> 16:35.640
We'll go to the movies
another time.

16:35.840 --> 16:39.780
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>If you're hoping my sister made</i>
<i>the noble decision,</i>

16:39.980 --> 16:42.880
<i>you and Billy are about</i>
<i>to be sorely disappointed...</i>

16:43.080 --> 16:45.130
Thanks, Billy.
You're the best.

16:53.310 --> 16:56.330
I heard Sheldon is
working with Prakash.

16:56.530 --> 16:58.460
Yeah, poor Prakash.

16:58.660 --> 16:59.610
(chuckles)

17:00.750 --> 17:02.600
* *

17:02.800 --> 17:05.140
Sheldon can be
a bit much sometimes,

17:05.340 --> 17:08.740
but you have to admit
he has a remarkable mind.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.710
As he will be
the first to tell you.

17:10.910 --> 17:12.130
(chuckling)

17:13.200 --> 17:14.410
I actually miss him.

17:14.610 --> 17:18.020
I suppose things are
a bit more lively

17:18.220 --> 17:19.350
when he's around.

17:19.550 --> 17:21.790
Wouldn't it be something
if he really did find

17:21.990 --> 17:23.190
life on other planets?

17:23.390 --> 17:24.760
He would
immediately become

17:24.960 --> 17:27.490
the most famous scientist
in the history of mankind.

17:27.690 --> 17:29.380
(chuckles)

17:30.180 --> 17:31.730
Where are you going?

17:31.930 --> 17:34.420
Just to see
if he needs any help.
Wait, I'll come with you.

17:39.450 --> 17:40.940
* *

17:41.140 --> 17:42.840
Wait, is that something?

17:43.040 --> 17:45.410
PRAKASH:
No.
Oh.

17:45.610 --> 17:47.060
(groans)

17:54.640 --> 17:56.290
What about that?

17:56.490 --> 17:58.820
No, that's within
the standard deviation.
