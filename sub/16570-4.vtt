00:11.661 --> 00:12.753
Fritzy, is that you?

00:12.929 --> 00:13.953
Oh.

00:16.700 --> 00:17.792
You cooked dinner.

00:20.637 --> 00:22.161
Yes.

00:22.806 --> 00:24.137
Things are slow at work...

00:24.874 --> 00:27.968
...so I... I went to the grocery store.

00:28.144 --> 00:29.270
And thought I'd cook dinner.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.674
What's in the box
you just put in cupboard?

00:36.820 --> 00:39.550
- Meat loaf and... And mashed potatoes?
- Yes.

00:39.723 --> 00:42.715
I thought you might be tired
of clam linguini. What's in the box?

00:43.193 --> 00:47.493
Uh, the vet called. He wanted to know
if I'd stop by and pick up...

00:47.664 --> 00:50.030
...Kitty's ashes. You know what, honey?

00:50.200 --> 00:52.168
Since the food is hot, why don't we just...

00:52.335 --> 00:53.666
Oh, this will just take a second.

00:53.837 --> 00:56.601
Now, I just want to take a quick look...

00:56.773 --> 01:00.004
...and I see dead bodies all the time.
It's not like...

01:00.176 --> 01:02.076
And Kitty was cremated, so...

01:05.215 --> 01:06.239
Oh.

01:07.617 --> 01:08.914
It's okay. It's all right.

01:09.085 --> 01:12.646
- They put him in a plastic bag.
- Her.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.847
They put her in a plastic bag.

01:15.024 --> 01:17.515
This is not ashes, it's chunks.

01:18.128 --> 01:22.758
And this should say "Kitty Johnson,"
Not "Kitty Howard."

01:22.932 --> 01:25.867
Hey, you know,
the vet gave me a brochure.

01:26.035 --> 01:28.299
See? They have all these, uh,
you know, decorative, uh...

01:28.471 --> 01:33.101
No, I don't want to be one of those women
who puts her cat in an urn.

01:33.276 --> 01:38.009
On the mantel with a picture
and a ribbon and a bell.

01:38.181 --> 01:41.048
I want to find some other way
to properly honor Kitty.

01:46.289 --> 01:48.484
Like spreading her ashes
around someplace...

01:48.658 --> 01:50.250
...that was important to her.

01:50.426 --> 01:52.917
Where? She was never
allowed to go outside.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.074

02:01.938 --> 02:03.303
Let's eat dinner.

02:15.552 --> 02:16.576
How is everything?

02:16.753 --> 02:19.551
This meal could not have been
better if we'd eaten it hot.

02:19.722 --> 02:20.950
Well, thank you.

02:22.358 --> 02:24.656
If nothing happens at work tomorrow...

02:24.828 --> 02:27.797
...I'll open the grill that my brother sent.

02:27.964 --> 02:31.593
Actually, you know, if things
are really that slow at work...

02:31.768 --> 02:33.793
...maybe you could do me a little favor.

02:34.170 --> 02:35.262
Mm.

02:35.872 --> 02:37.396
No, no, never mind. You're right.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.168
We're keeping
our professional lives separate.

02:48.818 --> 02:50.183
Well, how little is it?

02:51.387 --> 02:53.651
- The favor.
- Small.

02:55.325 --> 03:00.262
We, um... Well, the FBI needs to talk
to this guy, Austin Blair...

03:00.430 --> 03:01.795
...and, uh, we can't locate him.

03:01.965 --> 03:05.958
So if you could find out where he is for
us that would be, uh... You know, quietly.

03:06.135 --> 03:08.262
Just quietly.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.631
Very quietly.

03:13.343 --> 03:14.367
Why quietly?

03:14.944 --> 03:18.072
We don't want to tip off the whole world
we're looking for him.

03:18.915 --> 03:19.939
Hm.

03:21.351 --> 03:24.445
You're right. It really is a small favor.
Heh.

03:27.857 --> 03:28.881
What's his name again?

03:35.031 --> 03:38.125
- Who is Austin Blair?
- A 26-year-old single white male.

03:38.301 --> 03:41.634
I found Missing Persons
had a month-old file on him.

03:41.804 --> 03:44.864
And you want Major Crimes
to take over a Missing Persons case?

03:45.041 --> 03:46.065
Why would you do that?

03:46.242 --> 03:48.369
Look, you're the one
who's always preaching...

03:48.544 --> 03:50.842
...that we're one department.

03:54.517 --> 03:56.542
Uh, look, I've been asked...

03:56.719 --> 04:01.713
...to, um, keep Austin's name under the
radar. It's a special request.

04:01.891 --> 04:04.223
Special request?
What are we, a karaoke bar?

04:04.394 --> 04:07.761
Special request from whom,
regarding what?

04:09.065 --> 04:10.430
- What's wrong?
- I just, um...

04:10.600 --> 04:13.535
I just forgot to take Kitty
out of my purse this morning.

04:13.703 --> 04:16.433
Out of...? Where is she?

04:20.743 --> 04:22.005
She's...

04:22.178 --> 04:24.043
She's here.

04:29.118 --> 04:30.483
Oh.

04:32.655 --> 04:34.623
I gather she took a turn for the worse.

04:35.892 --> 04:38.452
If you don't want me
to take this Missing Persons case...

04:38.628 --> 04:40.493
No. No, no, no, look, ahem.

04:40.663 --> 04:43.131
Tell you what, why don't you
go back to your office...

04:43.299 --> 04:46.200
...and I'll have Commander Taylor
go down to Missing Person's...

04:46.369 --> 04:48.269
No, I'm perfectly capable of going down...

04:48.438 --> 04:53.273
Oh, no, no, no, you're too, you know.
You're a little too high-ranking.

04:53.743 --> 04:54.767
Oh.

04:54.944 --> 04:57.037
And, uh, you said
you want to keep this quiet.

04:57.213 --> 04:58.612
I did.

04:59.248 --> 05:00.943
Okay, thanks.

05:02.118 --> 05:06.145
- Uh, don't, uh...
- Oh, sorry.

05:07.156 --> 05:09.147
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.394
And this is where it all happens.

05:18.568 --> 05:22.868
Uh, this is the, this is Major Crimes.
My desk, right here.

05:23.039 --> 05:24.301
- Very nice.
- Uh, ah, look.

05:25.842 --> 05:27.673
- There he is.
- He looks exactly like you.

05:29.879 --> 05:34.509
Um, ah, here. Lauren, I would
like you to meet Sergeant Gabriel...

05:34.684 --> 05:36.777
...soon to be Detective Sergeant Gabriel.

05:36.953 --> 05:38.716
Well, I've got to pass the test first.

05:38.888 --> 05:41.254
But, uh, wow, it is a pleasure
to meet you, Lauren.

05:41.858 --> 05:44.520
Oh, and this is my go-to guy.

05:44.694 --> 05:46.218
This is Andy Flynn.

05:46.396 --> 05:48.193
Andy, I have heard so much about you.

05:48.364 --> 05:50.696
Really? Because, to me,
you're a complete surprise.

05:52.668 --> 05:55.000
Uh, Lauren, would you just excuse me
for one second, please?

05:55.171 --> 05:59.870
Ah, Commander Taylor,
please meet Ms. Lauren Hines.

06:00.043 --> 06:01.305
- Chief.
- Oh.

06:01.477 --> 06:02.967
Taylor's here
with the file you wanted.

06:03.146 --> 06:07.549
Uh, Lieutenant Flynn, who is that woman
with Lieutenant Provenza?

06:08.985 --> 06:10.850
His girlfriend.

06:11.654 --> 06:13.884
- You are kidding me.
- Mm-mm.

06:14.057 --> 06:16.651
Her name is Lauren.
She's a buyer for men's clothes...

06:16.826 --> 06:18.521
...for a high-end department store.

06:18.694 --> 06:21.561
- So ends the mystery of the new suits.
- Mm-hm.

06:22.799 --> 06:26.235
Oh, Commander Taylor, thank you so much
for going down to Missing Persons.

06:26.402 --> 06:30.361
They were anxious to know
why the sudden interest in Austin Blair.

06:30.540 --> 06:32.474
Not too anxious. What'd you tell them?

06:32.642 --> 06:36.476
I played dumb, which was easy,
seeing as how I don't know anything.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.979
Neither does Missing Persons,
all they have here are dental records...

06:40.149 --> 06:43.915
...and vehicle registrations.
Where are the follow-up reports?

06:44.087 --> 06:45.384
There wasn't any need.

06:45.555 --> 06:48.854
If you look, Austin was reported
missing by his boyfriend.

06:50.226 --> 06:54.959
Travis Myers, 22,
who last saw Austin leaving...

06:55.131 --> 06:58.191
Gosh, a month ago.
For an after-hours dance party.

06:58.367 --> 07:01.359
What does that have to do
with the absence of a follow-up report?

07:01.537 --> 07:04.529
Well, gay boy Austin goes out
for the night, doesn't come back.

07:04.707 --> 07:07.767
His boyfriend, this Travis kid,
comes in mad...

07:07.944 --> 07:10.708
...and wants us to find out
who Austin is sleeping with.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.474
It's a familiar pattern, Chief.

07:13.649 --> 07:15.913
Well, let's see
if this convenient stereotype...

07:16.085 --> 07:18.918
...you all have cooked up
to avoid actual police work...

07:19.088 --> 07:21.283
...holds up under closer scrutiny.

07:21.457 --> 07:25.587
Lieutenant Flynn, uh, would you please
run a master inquiry on Austin Blair?

07:25.761 --> 07:28.628
But, uh, do it quietly. Just...

07:28.798 --> 07:31.767
...offline, off the radar, off the grid.

07:31.934 --> 07:34.129
- Like it never happened, Chief.
- Thank you.

07:39.308 --> 07:41.902
Anybody know why
we are looking for this Austin Blair?

07:42.078 --> 07:44.774
Because the chief asked us to?

07:46.115 --> 07:50.245
Oh, Chief. Chief, uh, this is, uh...

07:50.419 --> 07:51.818
...my...

07:51.988 --> 07:53.956
Lauren Hines.

07:54.123 --> 07:56.921
- I'm so pleased to meet you.
- I'm so glad to meet you too.

07:57.093 --> 08:00.358
Since things were slow, Lauren came by
to see how our division works...

08:00.530 --> 08:02.657
...before I take her to lunch.

08:02.832 --> 08:04.629
Oh, good. How nice.

08:11.174 --> 08:13.165
So, Lauren, how old are you?

08:14.544 --> 08:16.944
Detective Sanchez.
You never ask a lady how...

08:17.113 --> 08:21.573
Oh, excuse us, Lauren. Ha, ha.
We kid a lot around here.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.912
- You know, always teasing each other.
- Ow.

08:24.086 --> 08:25.178
You know, cops.

08:27.523 --> 08:31.823
Uh, Detective Sanchez, what can you
tell me about, uh, Austin Blair?

08:31.994 --> 08:35.725
Uh, I ran the registration
on his Mercedes SUV.

08:35.898 --> 08:38.196
And his name pops up with dope.

08:38.366 --> 08:40.767
Brought in twice for questioning
but never arrested.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.201
His credit card's been active
all over the place.

08:43.371 --> 08:47.536
New York City, Miami, New Orleans,
Fort Lauderdale, all within the last year.

08:47.710 --> 08:49.974
But since he went missing
a month ago, nothing.

08:50.146 --> 08:52.307
Checked his address.
Nice place in Silver Lake.

08:52.481 --> 08:54.676
No liens, current on his mortgage.

08:54.850 --> 08:56.215
Okay.

08:56.385 --> 08:59.513
All right, well, good news.
I mean, depending on how you look at it.

08:59.689 --> 09:02.624
That was Dr. Morales. He says he has
four matches in the morgue.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.157
Oh, good. All right, then.

09:04.327 --> 09:08.388
Uh, Sergeant Gabriel, why don't you and I
pop over to the burrito room.

09:08.564 --> 09:12.022
And the rest of you all keep poking
around about Austin Blair...

09:12.201 --> 09:15.136
...on tippy-toe, please. Thank you.

09:15.304 --> 09:16.635
Shall we?

09:21.277 --> 09:23.905
It's funny you're here.
Missing Persons called earlier...

09:24.080 --> 09:26.571
...looking for bodies...
- Missing Persons called?

09:26.749 --> 09:28.944
- Bye-bye tippy-toe.
- Oh, for heaven's sakes.

09:29.118 --> 09:31.951
- What was that date again?
- Uh, 25th of last month.

09:32.121 --> 09:33.816
According to his boyfriend...

09:33.990 --> 09:36.390
...he went out to a dance club
and never came back.

09:37.593 --> 09:41.654
Boyfriend? Wait. 26 years old,
25th of last month?

09:41.831 --> 09:44.493
He wasn't just going to a club.
He was going to Hell-A.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.760
- Say what?
- Hell-A.

09:46.936 --> 09:49.427
Get it? Hell-A as in L.A.

09:50.573 --> 09:51.597
Big circuit party.

09:52.575 --> 09:54.167
Circuit party?

09:54.343 --> 09:57.676
Ah. Okay. Gay Culture 101.

09:57.847 --> 10:01.578
Circuit parties are kind of like gay raves.
They go on for three or four days.

10:01.751 --> 10:03.776
There's like one a month
all over the place.

10:03.953 --> 10:06.854
A white party here, a black party there.
Hell-A in Los Angeles.

10:08.224 --> 10:12.160
Uh, anyway, every year during
Hell-A week, we get a spike in ODs.

10:12.328 --> 10:15.661
Most of them get claimed right away,
but every once in a while...

10:15.831 --> 10:18.629
...we have an out-of-towner
that hangs out for a while.

10:19.168 --> 10:22.262
Yep. I think we've got
your John Doe here.

10:24.106 --> 10:29.100
Oh, Fritz! Uh, I mean, Special Agent
Howard. Uh, what a surprise.

10:29.278 --> 10:32.475
Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson,
this is Special Agent Jerry Moore.

10:32.648 --> 10:33.842
What are you doing?

10:34.016 --> 10:37.008
Someone in your Missing Persons
Division called around...

10:37.186 --> 10:41.122
...to find out why your sudden
interest in Austin Blair.

10:41.290 --> 10:42.587
I tried to keep it quiet.

10:42.758 --> 10:44.453
Hey, hey, guys, guys.

10:51.667 --> 10:54.431
That's him. That's Austin.

10:54.603 --> 10:55.627
Damn it.

10:56.105 --> 10:57.902
Oh, man. Damn it.

10:59.275 --> 11:00.765
Well, look at the bright side.

11:00.943 --> 11:03.673
At least he's not missing anymore.

11:07.316 --> 11:09.307
Let's see. Your guy was found in an alley.

11:09.485 --> 11:12.215
Aspirated vomit in the lungs.
Typical in an OD.

11:12.655 --> 11:15.317
I ordered a tox screen
of the common trail mix of drugs.

11:15.491 --> 11:18.016
- X, GHB, meth.
- What'd you say, trail mix?

11:18.194 --> 11:20.458
Circuit party boys
like to DJ their own high.

11:20.629 --> 11:23.291
X for dancing, GHB and meth for sex...

11:23.466 --> 11:24.763
...K for the comedown.

11:24.934 --> 11:29.428
In this case, though,
it was only GHB and alcohol in the vomit.

11:30.039 --> 11:33.031
Hmm. Most likely died in the alley
where he was found.

11:33.209 --> 11:35.905
- Why do you say that?
- Hell-A has a medical staff on site.

11:36.078 --> 11:38.239
Prevent someone drowning
in their own vomit.

11:38.414 --> 11:40.712
They plan on treating overdoses?

11:40.883 --> 11:43.647
More like they plan on covering
their asses if someone dies.

11:43.819 --> 11:45.013
Exactly.

11:45.187 --> 11:48.748
Thank you so much for the, uh,
background here. Much appreciated.

11:48.924 --> 11:53.156
- The FBI looks forward to your full report.
- Is the doctor working for us or for you?

11:53.329 --> 11:55.092
I work for the county.

11:55.264 --> 11:58.665
This morgue is neutral territory.
Like Switzerland, without the money.

11:58.834 --> 11:59.858
What...?

12:00.035 --> 12:02.060
The L.A.P.D. found Austin Blair.

12:02.238 --> 12:04.798
We deserve to know
why we were looking for him.

12:05.641 --> 12:08.269
All right, but we need to keep
this inside the FBI.

12:08.444 --> 12:10.469
How do you intend to do that?

12:14.450 --> 12:19.046
So due to a recent crossover
with a federal investigation, uh...

12:19.221 --> 12:23.681
...the bad news is we have to sign these
forms and be, uh, deputized into the FBI.

12:23.859 --> 12:25.520
And, once we're formally included...

12:25.694 --> 12:28.754
...they have to tell us
what happened to this Austin Blair...

12:28.931 --> 12:31.491
...and why it's apparently our problem.

12:33.369 --> 12:35.530
- What's this?
- We're joining the FBI.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.632
But it's only temporary, like love.

12:39.175 --> 12:42.110
Do we get badges?
They have really cool badges.

12:42.278 --> 12:44.838
Lauren, this is, uh...
This is some really top-secret stuff.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.175
Very hush-hush, um...

12:47.349 --> 12:50.807
Uh, Buzz, would you mind, uh, escorting
Lauren into the electronics room...

12:50.986 --> 12:53.147
...while we have our briefing?
- Not at all.

12:53.322 --> 12:56.519
Thanks. Oh, and, Buzz, ahem,
why don't you, uh...?

12:56.692 --> 12:58.887
Why don't you show her
one of my old interviews?

12:59.061 --> 13:01.291
How about the one with you
and John Wilkes Booth?

13:04.733 --> 13:07.702
Uh, was Austin's death a murder
or an overdose?

13:07.870 --> 13:09.838
Sign, and we'll tell everything we know.

13:10.005 --> 13:13.338
This agreement is binding
and shall remain in effect for 48 hours...

13:13.509 --> 13:16.945
...during which time we expect
you all to behave like FBI agents.

13:17.112 --> 13:20.513
I solemnly swear
to act as stupid as possible.

13:21.650 --> 13:24.016
Okay. Are there any questions?

13:24.186 --> 13:27.280
Well, yeah,
how did Austin Blair end up dead?

13:27.456 --> 13:29.014
- We don't know.
- Wait a minute.

13:29.191 --> 13:31.716
We track this guy down,
we find the body...

13:31.894 --> 13:33.418
...and you guys tell us nothing?

13:33.596 --> 13:35.427
I mean, this is our big briefing?

13:35.598 --> 13:37.793
Yeah. Welcome to the FBI, everyone.

13:37.967 --> 13:41.835
Right hand in the air, we do not know
if Austin's death was a murder or not.

13:42.004 --> 13:44.495
But let's say it was a homicide.

13:44.673 --> 13:48.074
- What would you guys do next?
- Notify his next of kin.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.269
His father's already
on his way down here.

13:50.446 --> 13:54.075
- Sounds good.
- Hm, thank you for your, uh, cooperation.

13:57.653 --> 14:00.588
Uh, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.951
Hold on.

14:03.125 --> 14:05.059
Am I working
with my husband or the FBI?

14:05.227 --> 14:07.127
- Yes.
- On an overdose or a murder?

14:07.296 --> 14:10.754
Maybe both. The second we know more,
we'll let you know.

14:12.301 --> 14:16.203
So far, I find being
an FBI agent very frustrating.

14:22.778 --> 14:25.838
Oh, Lauren. Lauren,
I... I am so sorry, sweetheart.

14:26.015 --> 14:28.882
But, uh, it looks like I am back on duty.

14:29.051 --> 14:32.316
Hmm. I understand. It was great
to meet your friends.

14:33.088 --> 14:34.578
Really?

14:43.899 --> 14:47.335
- Okay, you be careful out there.
- Oh, tell that to the bad guys.

14:59.381 --> 15:01.281
Whew, isn't she beautiful?

15:01.450 --> 15:03.179
You should watch how you kiss her.

15:03.352 --> 15:05.115
Your gun almost went off.

15:05.287 --> 15:06.515
You have no idea.

15:12.795 --> 15:16.253
Dr. Blair, thank you for coming.
We would have been happy to come to you.

15:16.432 --> 15:19.094
No, I'd rather not have police
in my waiting room.

15:19.268 --> 15:22.567
And just so you know,
I'm not getting Austin another attorney.

15:22.738 --> 15:26.504
If he's still involved with drugs,
that's his problem.

15:26.675 --> 15:29.109
All right, then.
Why don't you have a seat?

15:29.278 --> 15:32.304
We have a couple questions
we'd like to ask you about your son.

15:32.481 --> 15:36.212
My stepson. I adopted Austin
when I married his mother.

15:36.385 --> 15:40.879
One good thing about losing my wife,
she didn't live to see what became of him.

15:42.825 --> 15:46.625
- Why was he arrested?
- Oh, we haven't arrested him, sir.

15:46.795 --> 15:50.356
Can you tell me the last time
you saw or spoke to Austin?

15:51.700 --> 15:54.168
Yeah, about a month ago. Little longer.

15:54.336 --> 15:56.497
I spoke with him on the phone.
What happened?

15:56.672 --> 15:58.401
Can you tell why it's been so long...

15:58.574 --> 16:01.407
Did you not hear what I asked you?
What happened to Austin?

16:04.446 --> 16:06.277
Sir, I'm sorry to inform you...

16:06.448 --> 16:10.384
...that your stepson passed
away over a month ago.

16:12.554 --> 16:13.578
Austin's dead?

16:15.791 --> 16:16.815
How?

16:17.660 --> 16:19.685
Well, uh, it appears to have
been an overdose.

16:27.603 --> 16:29.696
You people.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.703
Wait. Can he just...?

16:32.875 --> 16:36.811
- Uh, sir? Doctor? Sir?
- Dr. Blair, please wait.

16:36.979 --> 16:38.742
I have surgery across town in an hour.

16:38.914 --> 16:42.247
Just call me with how I should go
about arranging for his funeral.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.544
You may be in shock.

16:43.719 --> 16:45.914
- You probably...
- Don't talk to me about shock.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.648
- You don't think I know about shock?
- We need to know...

16:48.824 --> 16:52.123
...if Austin had any enemies or anyone
who might have had a reason to...

16:52.294 --> 16:53.989
You're looking for a why?

16:54.163 --> 16:56.723
My God. Drugs don't give you a why.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.159
You want to know about Austin's life?

17:00.335 --> 17:03.736
Try talking to that kid
that's answering the phone at his house.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.873
You mean his boyfriend?

17:06.974 --> 17:09.170
How should I know who he is?

17:12.481 --> 17:14.472
Sit down. Now, what's your name?

17:14.650 --> 17:17.881
Travis. Travis Myers. What's going on?
What's going on here?

17:18.053 --> 17:19.315
Did you find Austin?

17:19.488 --> 17:21.422
Put that down. I don't have permission...

17:21.589 --> 17:25.821
We don't need permission, okay?
We have a search warrant.

17:25.993 --> 17:28.258
- Is there anyone else in this house?
- No.

17:28.430 --> 17:31.126
Do you know where Austin is?
Is he in jail or something?

17:31.300 --> 17:32.892
When's the last time you saw him?

17:33.068 --> 17:34.592
I reported him gone a month ago.

17:36.105 --> 17:39.165
Hey, will you stay away from there?
Get out of there. You can't...

17:39.341 --> 17:40.831
Sit down.

17:41.543 --> 17:43.773
Hey, Buzz, up here.

17:44.913 --> 17:46.403
Lieutenant.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.509
Oh.

17:54.189 --> 17:57.249
- Party time.
- The fridge is full of these.

17:57.426 --> 17:59.826
I brought my test kit. My guess is GHB.

17:59.995 --> 18:02.395
All right, so we know
your boyfriend is doing drugs.

18:02.564 --> 18:05.362
- Is he selling them, as well?
- Will you get out of my house?

18:05.534 --> 18:08.526
This is not your house, so you're
the one who's getting out.

18:08.704 --> 18:11.434
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me where Austin is.

18:11.607 --> 18:14.599
Yeah? Okay.
You want to know where he is?

18:14.777 --> 18:18.008
We found your boyfriend in the morgue.
He died a month ago.

18:18.514 --> 18:19.879
What? That's how you tell people?

18:20.048 --> 18:21.879
We're arresting you for possession...

18:22.050 --> 18:24.644
- You bastards! Let go!
...of a schedule-1 substance...

18:24.820 --> 18:26.811
...and the murder of Austin Blair.
- Austin!

18:29.491 --> 18:32.654
- Uh, yes, Chief.
- Lieutenant. Did you find anything?

18:34.730 --> 18:41.226
Uh, yeah. We found the boyfriend
with lots of loose cash...

18:41.403 --> 18:43.132
...and a fridge full of GHB.

18:43.305 --> 18:47.639
Chief, I don't think this was just some
guy that the FBI wanted to talk to.

18:47.810 --> 18:50.904
- Why do you say that?
- Well, Sanchez found a business card.

18:51.713 --> 18:52.907
Whose business card?

18:54.583 --> 18:58.417
Special Agent Fritz Howard,
with the FBI.

19:06.128 --> 19:07.789
- Hi.
- Oh, my goodness.

19:07.963 --> 19:10.591
So the FBI asks you
to find this Austin Blair...

19:10.766 --> 19:15.203
...who turns out to be a dead drug dealer
who has your husband's business card.

19:15.370 --> 19:19.033
So your fellow FBI agents,
ahem, i.e. Your squad and me...

19:19.208 --> 19:21.608
...are wondering if he might have been
an informant.

19:21.777 --> 19:24.473
If you're asking me if I knew
that going in, I did not.

19:24.646 --> 19:29.549
Okay? So we'll discuss it later.

19:33.155 --> 19:35.988
So the FBI has an operation
that goes south...

19:36.158 --> 19:38.456
...and they expect us to fix it for them.

19:42.831 --> 19:46.028
You know, maybe you should just not
bring your dead pets to work.

19:48.403 --> 19:49.995
<i>- Hello?
- Are you alone?</i>

19:50.172 --> 19:51.196
No.

19:51.373 --> 19:54.774
<i>- What do you want?
- Step into the back hallway.</i>

19:55.844 --> 19:59.109
Look, I'm gonna figure
this out. I promise. I just have to...

19:59.281 --> 20:01.215
Just... Excuse me.

20:04.519 --> 20:06.350
Hi. What?

20:07.856 --> 20:08.982
Why didn't...?

20:09.157 --> 20:12.524
Why didn't you just tell me
you were missing an informant?

20:12.694 --> 20:16.221
We didn't know Austin was missing.
He could have just run away.

20:16.398 --> 20:19.925
Looking for him ourselves could have
jeopardized a major drug investigation.

20:20.102 --> 20:23.003
Look, your team finding him
makes it look more ordinary.

20:23.171 --> 20:26.402
Oh, wonderful.
My wildest dreams achieved.

20:26.575 --> 20:29.635
- We're ordinary.
- Hey, look, look, the good news is...

20:29.811 --> 20:31.369
...everything is going very well.

20:31.546 --> 20:33.912
What is everything?
And how's it going well?

20:34.082 --> 20:36.243
Look, this is what I can tell you.

20:36.752 --> 20:39.243
We caught Austin
dealing GHB at a circuit party.

20:39.421 --> 20:44.484
We offered to let him go if he would help
us with an investigation I can't talk about.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.150
But then he disappeared.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.592
Disap...? He didn't disappear. He died.

20:48.764 --> 20:50.425
Well, granted. It's not ideal...

20:50.599 --> 20:55.593
...but you have retrieved vital
evidence from his house for us.

20:56.405 --> 20:59.806
- You have a potential suspect in custody.
- Suspect in what?

20:59.975 --> 21:02.000
Dr. Morales assumed it was an OD.

21:02.177 --> 21:05.010
His stepfather assumed it was an OD.
Why shouldn't I?

21:05.180 --> 21:09.981
Okay, but let's just pretend Austin's
death looks just a little more like murder.

21:10.152 --> 21:14.111
And you found some boy living
in his house with lots of drugs and money.

21:14.289 --> 21:18.055
- What would you do then?
- I would treat the boy like a murder suspect.

21:18.226 --> 21:20.353
Well, if that's your instinct.

21:21.663 --> 21:27.568
We found $30,000 worth of GHB,
plus another $80,000 in cash.

21:28.503 --> 21:32.200
And when Missing Persons asked you
if Austin had a drug or alcohol problem...

21:32.374 --> 21:35.241
...what did he say, lieutenant?

21:35.811 --> 21:38.041
<i>He said, "Not that I know of."</i>

21:38.213 --> 21:40.340
<i>All those drugs, all that money...</i>

21:40.515 --> 21:42.574
<i>...and you didn't know
that Austin was a drug dealer?</i>

21:42.751 --> 21:45.618
<i>- He wasn't a user.
- That's not what the autopsy said.</i>

21:47.756 --> 21:49.553
What else, lieutenant?

21:49.725 --> 21:51.818
He said he last saw Austin
going out at night.

21:51.994 --> 21:55.293
When asked where,
Travis answered, "I'm not sure."

21:56.064 --> 21:58.760
Look, I was afraid that if you guys knew
where he'd gone...

21:58.934 --> 22:01.801
...you'd think he'd been partying
and wouldn't look for him.

22:01.970 --> 22:03.904
But he'd call if he wasn't coming home.

22:04.072 --> 22:08.008
Home. His home. Where you sure
made yourself comfortable.

22:08.176 --> 22:11.509
Living his life, selling his drugs,
maybe, spending his money.

22:11.680 --> 22:14.740
I only use it to pay his bills.
I have a job of my own, okay?

22:15.250 --> 22:18.310
I'm saving up to go to college out here,
establishing my residency.

22:18.487 --> 22:20.751
Oh, I'm not sure
I see college in your future.

22:20.922 --> 22:24.358
I might be able to find a permanent spot
for you in a California facility.

22:24.526 --> 22:29.020
I was afraid to throw the drugs out because
I didn't know who might come for them.

22:29.197 --> 22:31.097
Or who might show up
asking for the money.

22:31.266 --> 22:33.791
Did you fill out this useless
Missing Persons report...

22:33.969 --> 22:37.166
...so that you'd look more innocent
when we found Austin's dead body?

22:37.339 --> 22:38.772
- No.
- You don't look innocent.

22:38.940 --> 22:42.034
- You look guiltier by the second.
- What do you want from me?

22:42.210 --> 22:46.670
What I want is you to tell me exactly what
happened the last night you saw Austin.

22:46.848 --> 22:49.339
- Start cooperating.
- I am cooperating.

22:49.518 --> 22:53.454
I'm cooperating. I'm cooperating.
What do you think that I'm doing? God.

22:54.689 --> 22:56.680
So Travis...

22:57.392 --> 23:00.156
...would you describe
yourself as the jealous type?

23:01.329 --> 23:04.321
<i>Did you call the police because
you thought Austin was cheating on you?</i>

23:05.700 --> 23:07.395
<i>In fact, how do we even know...</i>

23:07.569 --> 23:09.867
<i>...that the two of you were a couple?
- We were.</i>

23:10.038 --> 23:14.634
Then why did he go to an after-hours
dance party and leave you at home?

23:16.044 --> 23:19.878
Austin... Austin didn't want me
with him because...

23:20.682 --> 23:23.742
...he said that he had this big meeting
with his boss at Hell-A...

23:23.919 --> 23:26.319
...and that just sounded lame. So yeah...

23:26.488 --> 23:29.514
...when he drove off and
left me at home, I was jealous.

23:30.058 --> 23:33.960
And when he didn't come home
and when he didn't pick up his cell...

23:34.129 --> 23:37.155
...I called to see if there
really had been a meeting.

23:37.332 --> 23:40.859
And his boss told me that Austin
left the party with somebody else.

23:41.036 --> 23:43.129
So I just didn't know
what to believe anymore.

23:43.305 --> 23:48.242
Hang on, hang on. So you're telling me
that Austin was an employee of Hell-A?

23:48.410 --> 23:50.105
He wasn't just dealing drugs?

23:51.980 --> 23:53.675
Dealing drugs was his job.

23:57.953 --> 24:00.717
Austin flew all over the country.

24:01.490 --> 24:04.891
- Everywhere that his boss held a party.
- Now we're getting somewhere.

24:05.060 --> 24:08.086
<i>At all these different parties,
Austin flew in with a supply...</i>

24:08.263 --> 24:09.457
...of GHB to sell?

24:10.065 --> 24:13.967
No. You can't take all that G on a plane.
Those are the rules.

24:14.636 --> 24:15.694
Whose rules?

24:20.542 --> 24:22.908
Peter Benjamin's rules.

24:23.979 --> 24:26.880
<i>- He was Austin's boss.
- Stop the interview. Stop it.</i>

24:27.048 --> 24:30.017
- But she's not done yet.
- Buzz, pull the plug.

24:30.185 --> 24:33.120
- I don't work for you.
- Chief Johnson, stop.

24:33.288 --> 24:37.315
We have what we need.
FBI rules. You signed an agreement.

24:43.498 --> 24:44.760
Um...

24:47.736 --> 24:50.102
Wait. Is that what you needed to know?

24:51.273 --> 24:53.332
That's all for now, Travis. Thank you.

24:54.609 --> 24:55.667
Can I see him, please?

24:57.112 --> 24:59.512
Austin. Can I see him?

25:03.185 --> 25:04.777
Excuse me.

25:08.990 --> 25:11.185
If Benjamin had something
to do with Austin's death...

25:11.359 --> 25:13.350
...I should be conducting
the interview.

25:13.528 --> 25:16.156
We've invited you to observe.

25:17.532 --> 25:21.798
And do everything the stupid FBI way
without any recorders or cameras.

25:21.970 --> 25:24.564
- Can I take notes?
- We have one person taking notes...

25:24.739 --> 25:27.367
...during an interview.
- I'm happy with that being me.

25:27.909 --> 25:29.536
Look, do you want noodles or rice?

25:29.711 --> 25:32.202
Are you gonna let me ask
Peter Benjamin questions?

25:32.380 --> 25:34.314
- You can participate with follow-ups.
- Oh.

25:34.482 --> 25:37.508
Look, this is our very first
crack at this guy.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.151
- Which, which, which?
- Rice.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.219
Okay.

25:44.726 --> 25:49.322
Now, while we eat,
I am moving Kitty over here.

25:49.497 --> 25:54.161
No, no, no. I hate this feeling
of not knowing everything you know.

26:01.276 --> 26:03.836
And on top of everything
that happened to poor Kitty.

26:04.012 --> 26:05.070
That is not gonna work.

26:08.250 --> 26:09.649
Fine.

26:10.318 --> 26:11.751
One FBI agent to another...

26:13.989 --> 26:16.787
...are you using this investigation
to get back at me?

26:16.958 --> 26:18.425
No.

26:18.593 --> 26:20.493
My first loyalty is to you.

26:20.662 --> 26:24.257
Just like I am sure
your first loyalty is to me.

26:24.432 --> 26:25.899
Right?

26:26.935 --> 26:30.166
- Right?
- Of course it is, yes.

26:30.338 --> 26:31.362
Okay, then.

26:36.344 --> 26:39.108
- Thank you.
- Okay.

26:40.048 --> 26:43.040
I'm gonna show you something,
which later you have to pretend...

26:43.218 --> 26:45.277
...you are watching
for the first time, okay?

26:45.854 --> 26:46.878
Okay.

26:48.089 --> 26:51.058
The night we lost him, Austin Blair...

26:51.860 --> 26:53.088
...was wearing a wire.

26:59.401 --> 27:02.063
This is where the party
is just getting started.

27:08.109 --> 27:10.304
Now, there's Austin
handing off the GHB.

27:11.112 --> 27:12.602
Mm-hm.

27:18.953 --> 27:22.320
That's the recovery room
with the medical staff.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.967
Goes on like this until...

27:38.606 --> 27:41.006
Austin wanders into the bathroom.

27:50.452 --> 27:53.944
<i>- Looks like he's not doing well.
- Hey, man. Hey, man, you all right?</i>

27:54.823 --> 27:57.485
<i>- Are you all right?
- Oh, no.</i>

27:57.659 --> 27:59.024
And he just passes out.

28:02.464 --> 28:04.864
So, Mr. Benjamin, that's the end.

28:05.033 --> 28:06.864
Now let's start with the beginning.

28:07.035 --> 28:10.436
Can you describe your relationship
with the deceased, Austin Blair?

28:11.639 --> 28:15.439
Austin worked for me at different venues
across the country...

28:15.610 --> 28:19.239
...and from what you said earlier,
it now seems obvious...

28:19.414 --> 28:22.645
...he was going off dealing drugs
on the side.

28:22.817 --> 28:24.978
May I follow up?

28:25.754 --> 28:28.450
Did you actually see Austin Blair
leave the Hell-A party...

28:28.623 --> 28:31.285
...on the night he disappeared?
- Uh, no.

28:31.459 --> 28:34.189
That's odd, because you told
Travis Myers...

28:34.362 --> 28:36.455
...that you saw Austin leave
with another man.

28:36.631 --> 28:41.000
Travis. When I told the kid
Austin left with someone...

28:41.169 --> 28:44.832
...I was speaking more
about a historical pattern.

28:45.006 --> 28:48.703
You know, Austin,
he never left by himself.

28:49.511 --> 28:51.706
Mr. Benjamin,
returning to the party itself...

28:51.880 --> 28:55.372
Ahem...
...can you tell us...

28:58.086 --> 28:59.917
...did, um...

29:00.822 --> 29:03.052
Did any, uh...

29:03.224 --> 29:06.591
Did any individuals receive
medical attention during Hell-A?

29:06.761 --> 29:07.921
Of course.

29:08.096 --> 29:10.826
We have two recovery rooms
staffed specifically...

29:10.999 --> 29:12.990
...for people who, you know, overdo it.

29:13.668 --> 29:16.637
Would one of those have been
Austin Blair?

29:17.038 --> 29:18.630
Okay.

29:19.908 --> 29:22.843
Now, not to stomp
on a dead kid's reputation...

29:23.011 --> 29:25.309
...but, as we all saw the footage...

29:25.480 --> 29:28.938
...obviously, Austin was dipping
heavily into his own supply.

29:30.084 --> 29:31.745
He crashed in a bathroom.

29:31.920 --> 29:35.185
He was brought to our doctor,
put in a recovery position on his side...

29:35.356 --> 29:38.086
...to prevent him from choking
on what might come up...

29:38.259 --> 29:40.557
...and rehydrated with a saline IV.

29:40.728 --> 29:43.891
And when he got to feeling better,
I fired him.

29:44.999 --> 29:48.025
- So Austin recovered?
- Yes.

29:48.203 --> 29:52.071
And I assume, at some point,
he got in his car, and he drove home.

29:52.240 --> 29:54.470
Really? Follow-up, please?

29:54.642 --> 29:57.406
I have three witnesses
who saw employees of Hell-A...

29:57.579 --> 30:00.377
...drag Austin Blair, unconscious,
out into an alleyway...

30:00.548 --> 30:02.641
This. We never agreed
to take questions...

30:02.817 --> 30:05.081
...implicating my client
in criminal activities.

30:05.253 --> 30:07.585
Okay, okay,
I think we need a break, okay?

30:07.755 --> 30:08.779
Agent Johnson?

30:09.424 --> 30:15.329
- Can we, uh, convene in the hallway?
- Oh, absolutely.

30:15.697 --> 30:18.757
Enjoy your bagel, Mr. Benjamin.

30:20.969 --> 30:23.437
Hey. Hey.

30:23.671 --> 30:27.107
Do you really have three witnesses who
saw Austin Blair being dragged out?

30:27.275 --> 30:28.572
Of course not. How could I?

30:29.244 --> 30:33.510
Brenda, if the FBI lies in an interview
our case can get thrown out of court.

30:33.681 --> 30:36.343
- I'm not going to federal court.
- Yeah, but technically...

30:36.518 --> 30:37.951
...you are in the FBI.

30:38.887 --> 30:42.789
You're willing to just sit there and let
this guy eat bagels and lie up a storm?

30:44.125 --> 30:45.524
What would you do differently?

30:45.693 --> 30:48.423
When suspects lie to us,
we have to lie back.

30:49.197 --> 30:51.256
Fritzy, if we all stop
lying to each other...

30:51.432 --> 30:53.832
...how will we ever get to the truth?

31:01.509 --> 31:03.477
If you think
you can remember some stuff...

31:03.645 --> 31:05.078
...Benjamin said in this interview.

31:05.246 --> 31:06.474
I'm pretty sure I can.

31:06.648 --> 31:10.607
Well, then say Austin
didn't die of an overdose.

31:10.785 --> 31:11.877
What would you do then?

31:12.053 --> 31:14.715
For heaven's sakes.
You want to know what I'd do?

31:15.723 --> 31:17.691
Here. I quit the stupid FBI.

31:17.859 --> 31:22.421
And from now on the L.A.P.D. regards
the death of Austin Blair as a murder.

31:23.565 --> 31:25.157
That's what we wanted anyway.

31:25.333 --> 31:28.359
Well, then you better
just hush up then and be grateful.

31:35.677 --> 31:37.542
<i>So Austin recovered?</i>

31:37.712 --> 31:39.270
<i>Yes.</i>

31:39.447 --> 31:43.611
<i>And I assume, at some point,
he got in his car, and he drove home.</i>

31:43.785 --> 31:46.720
Dr. Morales found no puncture
wounds on Austin's body...

31:46.888 --> 31:49.083
...so no IV was given to rehydrate.

31:49.257 --> 31:51.782
Peter Benjamin lied.
And according to the tox screen...

31:51.960 --> 31:55.191
...Austin took 4 grams of GHB
over the usual recreational dose.

31:55.363 --> 31:56.853
Maybe someone spiked his drink.

31:57.565 --> 32:00.033
Because they knew
that Austin came wearing a wire.

32:00.201 --> 32:02.465
And look. Look here.
This pocket's been ripped...

32:02.637 --> 32:05.538
...and the camera lens appears
to have been located here...

32:05.707 --> 32:07.698
...where this missing
faux pearl button was.

32:07.875 --> 32:10.935
- Faux what?
- Faux. It's French for fake.

32:11.112 --> 32:13.580
- You know, like a faux relationship.
- Yeah, ha, ha.

32:13.748 --> 32:17.206
Yeah, lieutenant, how many more
new suits are you going to buy, sir?

32:17.385 --> 32:20.582
One a day, if that's what it takes.
What a bunch of cynical bastards.

32:20.755 --> 32:23.724
All right, everyone, please focus.

32:23.891 --> 32:27.884
A belt, wrist band, a watch.

32:28.062 --> 32:31.930
Set of car keys. No wire anywhere.

32:32.100 --> 32:33.761
And just looking at this stuff...

32:33.935 --> 32:37.371
...with the ripped shirt pocket,
the missing wallet, the OD.

32:37.538 --> 32:40.006
On the surface this looks like a guy
who got mugged...

32:40.174 --> 32:42.938
...because he was too bombed
to find his car and drive home.

32:43.111 --> 32:44.772
Wait, wait, wait.

32:45.647 --> 32:47.842
Too bombed to drive home.

32:48.149 --> 32:50.583
Benjamin said something
about Austin driving off...

32:50.752 --> 32:53.312
...except he was found in an alley.

32:53.488 --> 32:54.750
So where's his car?

32:54.922 --> 32:56.685
We haven't found his vehicle anywhere.

32:56.858 --> 32:59.053
Maybe someone
has another set of keys.

33:01.095 --> 33:05.088
- Travis, do these look familiar?
- Yeah, I think they're Austin's.

33:05.266 --> 33:08.565
- Do you happen to have a spare set?
- No, I drove my own jeep out here.

33:08.736 --> 33:11.432
Austin was nervous about
anyone else driving his dad's car.

33:23.985 --> 33:26.647
Don't worry, doctor. I'll get it.

33:29.157 --> 33:30.647
Oof, there. That's better.

33:30.825 --> 33:33.760
Dr. Blair, this is a warrant
to search the premises.

33:33.928 --> 33:36.954
Uh, sir, perhaps you can explain
why your dead son's...

33:37.498 --> 33:40.262
I'm sorry, stepson's car
is in your garage.

33:40.435 --> 33:41.732
Why are you doing this?

33:41.903 --> 33:44.804
Why? Don't you know, doctor?

33:44.972 --> 33:47.133
Drugs don't give you a why.

33:47.475 --> 33:48.965
<i>I can explain why I have his car.</i>

33:49.477 --> 33:51.035
<i>I would love to hear that, sir.</i>

33:51.212 --> 33:53.112
<i>Because it's mine.</i>

33:53.281 --> 33:55.749
<i>I registered it to Austin
for insurance reasons.</i>

33:55.917 --> 33:59.546
He was supposed to send me the payments.
When he stopped, I took the car back.

34:00.788 --> 34:02.983
- How'd you find it?
- I went to his house.

34:03.157 --> 34:04.818
But here's the confusing part, sir.

34:05.560 --> 34:08.552
Austin never made it home from
Hell-A, and neither did his car...

34:08.730 --> 34:11.460
...so how did you pick it up at his house?
- I don't know.

34:11.632 --> 34:15.329
- Maybe his friend, what's his name?
- Travis. He didn't have the keys.

34:17.505 --> 34:21.635
Look, I... I know you're just
doing your job, but honestly...

34:21.809 --> 34:23.708
...I've got to be at Cedars by 4:00, so...

34:23.878 --> 34:26.005
- They know you're not coming.
- We called ahead.

34:26.179 --> 34:28.273
- We've also searched your office.
- You what?

34:28.449 --> 34:32.351
Where my colleagues found
supplies for a professional-grade drug lab.

34:33.855 --> 34:36.255
<i>No, no, no. Whatever you think
you've found there...</i>

34:36.424 --> 34:37.857
...has a medical application.

34:38.025 --> 34:40.926
Fifty liters of gamma-Butyrolactone?

34:41.496 --> 34:43.554
The main precursor in making GHB?

34:43.731 --> 34:47.167
What exactly is the application for that,
medically speaking?

34:47.335 --> 34:51.237
This may be obvious.
I care a great deal about my cars.

34:51.405 --> 34:55.101
Gamma-Butyrolactone,
it cleans the chrome wheels and such.

34:55.275 --> 34:58.245
Did you know that your
wheel cleaner comes from China?

34:58.412 --> 35:00.846
It's chock-full of unique impurities.

35:01.883 --> 35:04.875
<i>We could match the GHB
that we found at Austin's house...</i>

35:05.052 --> 35:07.111
<i>...to that which we found
in Austin's body.</i>

35:07.288 --> 35:08.380
<i>And connect it all...</i>

35:08.556 --> 35:10.717
...to what we found at your office.

35:12.560 --> 35:14.721
Can you do any of that
at the county crime lab?

35:15.029 --> 35:18.396
Uh, probably not.
Actually, you can't do it anywhere.

35:18.566 --> 35:21.330
- She always lie like this?
- I hope not.

35:21.502 --> 35:25.165
You ever hear of a man by the name
of Peter Benjamin, doc?

35:27.742 --> 35:31.838
Let's see if this jogs your memory. You were
in the drug business with your stepson.

35:32.013 --> 35:33.913
The FBI caught Austin dealing.

35:34.081 --> 35:37.141
They promised they'd go easy on him
if he gave them his supplier.

35:37.318 --> 35:41.015
They were asking him to turn on the man
he thought of as his father.

35:41.189 --> 35:44.556
No, no. Hold on, hold on a second.
Just hold on here.

35:44.725 --> 35:48.752
- You are jumping to all sorts of conclusions.
- All right, let me make this easy on you.

35:48.930 --> 35:53.765
The L.A.P.D. doesn't care about the GHB.
We won't be arresting you for that.

35:56.103 --> 35:59.266
All I care about is finding the person
who murdered your stepson.

36:00.675 --> 36:02.165
And then you and I are done.

36:06.814 --> 36:08.281
All right.

36:10.818 --> 36:11.842
All right.

36:14.722 --> 36:17.418
Listen, you have to understand just...

36:17.592 --> 36:20.459
Just how much money
I lost in the crash.

36:21.128 --> 36:24.894
And you see, Austin,
he introduced me to this Peter Benjamin.

36:25.066 --> 36:27.125
At first, things went very well.

36:27.301 --> 36:29.201
And then the FBI caught Austin dealing.

36:29.370 --> 36:30.997
Austin thought that I could...

36:31.172 --> 36:33.868
...just stop making the GHB.
Get rid of the equipment.

36:34.041 --> 36:36.874
He would feed the feds Peter.
We would both go free.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.409
<i>That was very naive.</i>

36:41.582 --> 36:42.640
How?

36:42.817 --> 36:45.445
Peter Benjamin was in
much the same place that I was.

36:45.620 --> 36:49.351
His portfolio was in ruins, attendance was
down, the party revenue was nothing...

36:49.523 --> 36:53.653
...compared to what he made selling drugs.
So when I told him that I wanted out...

36:55.730 --> 36:58.597
Well, he grew very angry.
He threatened me.

36:58.766 --> 37:01.929
I had no choice but to tell him
what was going on and why.

37:02.103 --> 37:06.062
So Austin tried to protect you,
and you went and got him killed?

37:06.240 --> 37:10.506
No. No, no. No. Peter said, well,
he would just fire Austin...

37:10.678 --> 37:12.703
...make him useless to the FBI.

37:12.880 --> 37:16.145
It wasn't until afterwards, when Peter
called me, when he ordered me...

37:16.317 --> 37:18.842
...to come pick up that car that I...

37:19.620 --> 37:23.522
- That I found out what really happened.
- That's awfully vague, doctor.

37:26.560 --> 37:27.857
That Austin had been killed.

37:29.263 --> 37:32.528
And Peter Benjamin said that I had
better keep the GHB coming...

37:32.700 --> 37:36.033
...or the same thing would happen to me.
And that is a quote.

37:38.105 --> 37:40.369
Listen, you gotta believe me.

37:40.942 --> 37:44.207
I'm telling you the truth. I swear.

37:46.013 --> 37:47.037
I believe you.

37:49.684 --> 37:52.710
If you'll take a moment
to write all that down...

37:53.554 --> 37:57.183
...the L.A.P.D. will be releasing
you from custody.

38:07.501 --> 38:10.698
- Special Agent Howard.
- Yes, Former Agent Johnson.

38:11.439 --> 38:14.897
Suppose you were running
a major dope case...

38:15.076 --> 38:16.941
...and the L.A.P.D. found your supplier.

38:17.111 --> 38:19.841
What would you normally do
under those circumstances?

38:21.515 --> 38:25.076
- I'd trade my murderer for your doctor.
- On one condition.

38:26.887 --> 38:28.081
Austin's money stays here.

38:29.123 --> 38:30.420
Why?

38:30.591 --> 38:33.185
- Finally gonna repaint this place?
- That's my business.

38:33.361 --> 38:36.387
You don't need that cash to close
your case. Deal or no deal?

38:36.564 --> 38:37.997
Deal.

38:39.867 --> 38:44.167
- And thank you.
- You're welcome.

38:49.243 --> 38:52.701
Dr. Blair, it's been a real pleasure.
I'll see you when I see you.

38:53.381 --> 38:55.849
Gentlemen, I expect
Peter Benjamin in this building...

38:56.017 --> 38:59.578
...as quickly as humanly possible.
Thank you.

39:02.323 --> 39:03.813
You see?

39:03.991 --> 39:06.391
Did this not turn out exactly
the way I said it would?

39:06.560 --> 39:09.927
Hmm.
What does she want the money for?

39:10.097 --> 39:12.622
Oh, I have no idea.

39:14.602 --> 39:17.969
- Sergeant.
- Ah, Special Agents Moore...

39:18.139 --> 39:20.369
...and Howard of the FBI.

39:21.242 --> 39:23.972
The doctor will see you now.

39:26.380 --> 39:30.146
Dr. Dennis Blair, you're under arrest...

39:30.317 --> 39:34.014
...for the manufacture and distribution
of a class-1 controlled substance...

39:34.188 --> 39:37.919
...tax evasion, racketeering,
and conspiracy to commit murder.

39:46.400 --> 39:47.890
- Chief?
- Yes?

39:49.703 --> 39:51.603
I put, uh, Travis in your office.

39:51.772 --> 39:53.103
Oh. Thank you.

39:53.274 --> 39:55.834
- This is from evidence lock-up.
- Thanks.

39:56.010 --> 40:00.913
Oh, uh, lieutenant,
you look so different today.

40:02.149 --> 40:04.583
Well, it's a new style.

40:05.753 --> 40:08.847
- Ahem, country gentleman.
- I call it "Mister Rogers."

40:09.023 --> 40:12.288
It's going to be big next year.

40:13.694 --> 40:16.686
Well, it's... It's very becoming.

40:19.633 --> 40:21.396
Be nice.

40:30.611 --> 40:31.771
Where's his shirt?

40:32.379 --> 40:34.210
Uh, we have to keep that, I'm afraid.

40:34.882 --> 40:37.043
It's part of our murder case
against Peter Benjamin.

40:37.885 --> 40:39.045
Oh, okay.

40:39.553 --> 40:41.544
There's one more thing, though.

40:53.734 --> 40:55.998
We can't prove where
that money came from.

40:56.170 --> 40:58.866
You were living at his house.
For all we know, it's yours.

40:59.039 --> 41:01.007
No. I don't want it.

41:01.175 --> 41:05.271
Look, Travis, you no longer
have a place to live.

41:05.446 --> 41:09.712
And getting your things out of Austin's
house is going to be extremely difficult.

41:10.084 --> 41:13.349
I want Austin. Not this.

41:13.521 --> 41:16.615
It's not disloyal to Austin's memory
for you to have this money.

41:16.790 --> 41:19.520
You were saving up to go to college.

41:19.693 --> 41:22.184
Let's have something good
come out of all this.

41:27.434 --> 41:28.867
Okay?

41:34.508 --> 41:39.707
If I hadn't tried to get your mind off
of Kitty by asking you for a favor...

41:39.980 --> 41:41.880
And if I hadn't brought Kitty to work...

41:42.049 --> 41:45.712
...Pope never would have handed me
that Missing Persons case.

41:46.620 --> 41:49.680
He was super-loyal, even in death.

41:49.857 --> 41:52.690
She was super-loyal.

41:53.427 --> 41:55.361
I think she'd be very proud.

42:01.735 --> 42:05.068
So which one of Kitty's
babysitting DVDs...

42:05.239 --> 42:07.036
...do you want to watch?

42:08.075 --> 42:11.010
"Cheetah in the Land of the Lion"...

42:11.178 --> 42:12.873
...or "Birds of the Amazon"?

42:13.047 --> 42:15.777
Killing versus mating.

42:16.984 --> 42:18.747
You choose.

42:31.765 --> 42:34.461
<i>Of the more than 1500 species...</i>

42:34.635 --> 42:41.370
<i>...of birds found in the Amazon basin
none is more loyal than the macaw.</i>

42:41.742 --> 42:43.642
<i>Known to mate for life...</i>

42:43.811 --> 42:46.837
<i>...these beautiful animals
fiercely defend their families...</i>

42:47.014 --> 42:51.883
<i>...from any predator, large or small.</i>
