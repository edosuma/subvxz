WEBVTT

02:00.096 --> 02:01.931
I'm sorry.

02:08.638 --> 02:11.674
Gotta admit, I'm impressed.

02:13.010 --> 02:14.811
You really went all in.

02:16.412 --> 02:18.481
Please don't kill me.

04:58.220 --> 05:00.631
Dude. Are you still smoking?

05:00.711 --> 05:03.166
- I am not.
- Yeah, you are.

05:03.246 --> 05:06.915
You got heavy, Cheetah. What you been eating?

05:11.738 --> 05:14.180
- You like that?
- I missed you.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.981
- Did you miss that?
- I did.

05:20.831 --> 05:23.185
- How's track?
- It's good.

05:23.265 --> 05:25.206
- Your knee holding up?
- Yeah.

05:25.286 --> 05:27.970
Trainer's keeping it healthy, you know?

05:28.838 --> 05:31.157
What have you been up to, bro?

05:38.935 --> 05:41.739
What's cooking, good-looking? Oh, man!

05:41.819 --> 05:44.820
Dude, come here, come here.

05:47.123 --> 05:50.547
Oh, man. Still pumping shit, I see.

05:50.927 --> 05:52.883
Oh, that truck looks good.

05:52.963 --> 05:55.453
Hey. Hi.

05:56.433 --> 06:00.057
- Compliments to your father on the SUV.
- Thank you.

06:00.137 --> 06:01.638
How's townie life?

06:03.372 --> 06:05.207
There she goes.

06:06.642 --> 06:08.878
You pussies need floaties?

06:13.550 --> 06:15.351
What is his name?

08:26.349 --> 08:28.539
- Are we going to starve?
- Maybe.

08:28.619 --> 08:32.308
That's a nifty blade. Did you just,
like, pick that up for the trip?

08:33.188 --> 08:35.190
No, I've had it for a while.

08:41.898 --> 08:43.755
It says "Victor."

08:43.835 --> 08:46.023
Just in case I try to steal it.

08:46.103 --> 08:48.104
You always were a bit of a klepto.

08:53.209 --> 08:55.077
It's really nice.

08:56.546 --> 08:58.347
It's okay.

10:48.457 --> 10:50.026
Fuck.

12:02.598 --> 12:05.289
<i>Dispatch to all units. Dispatch to all units.</i>

12:05.369 --> 12:08.779
<i>FAA reports loss of radar contact
with small plane...</i>

12:08.859 --> 12:11.728
<i>...in the vicinity of McDonald Lake.</i>

12:11.808 --> 12:14.476
<i>Unconfirmed reports of single parachute.</i>

12:20.015 --> 12:22.582
- All right, all right. Heads up.
- Yes. All right.

12:22.662 --> 12:24.887
We'll both go up there, all right?

12:47.713 --> 12:50.412
Oh, my God, that was a fucking big one!

13:03.826 --> 13:06.796
- Okay, synchronize, synchronize.
- I want to stretch.

13:18.554 --> 13:21.777
I think I might have just pissed myself.

13:24.179 --> 13:26.250
He's still not potty trained?

13:41.997 --> 13:43.999
Your hands are so soft.

13:44.600 --> 13:48.205
- They're morons.
- Yeah, I can see that.

13:48.605 --> 13:52.674
- Are you lost or something?
- No, no, no. I'm not lost.

13:54.309 --> 13:56.511
You all right, Cheet?

13:57.593 --> 13:59.414
Yeah, she's fine.

14:00.283 --> 14:05.076
Do you have a cigarette by any chance?
Do you smoke... Cheet?

14:06.356 --> 14:08.445
Do you guys smoke?
Do you have any cigarettes?

14:08.525 --> 14:10.180
- No. Sorry, man.
- No.

14:10.260 --> 14:13.195
Or any pain meds? Oxycontin?

14:14.363 --> 14:15.899
No.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.635
Okay.

14:21.336 --> 14:24.973
Sorry to bother you. Go easy on them, Cheet.

14:30.647 --> 14:33.903
- I like his bandanna.
- Who was that?

14:34.483 --> 14:36.551
Just some random hiker.

14:42.992 --> 14:45.060
Kind of sexy for an older guy.

15:14.456 --> 15:16.458
You know, I thought I was over it.

15:19.094 --> 15:21.952
I was just trying to do the right thing.

15:22.632 --> 15:26.131
You know? I was trying to step up,
because that's what...

15:26.911 --> 15:29.205
...I'm supposed to do, but...

15:31.707 --> 15:35.198
...it's just fucking heavy, you know?

15:35.278 --> 15:36.834
I...

15:37.414 --> 15:39.936
...and then you guys just left.

15:40.016 --> 15:42.205
And I'm stuck here.

15:42.285 --> 15:45.142
Maybe it's easy for you to just, like...

15:46.122 --> 15:49.180
...pretend like it didn't happen. But...

15:49.760 --> 15:51.315
Hey.

15:52.895 --> 15:54.417
What?

15:54.497 --> 15:58.305
Nothing. Are you all right?
Do you need anything?

15:59.635 --> 16:02.125
No, yeah, I'm good. Yeah.

16:02.605 --> 16:06.675
- Do you need something?
- No. Right... no, never mind.

16:17.153 --> 16:19.321
You guys talking about your feelings?

16:21.557 --> 16:24.781
Okay, all packed.
Hey, man, do you have any matches?

16:24.861 --> 16:27.483
Because my balls
are like snow cones right now.

16:27.563 --> 16:30.053
Yeah, in my backpack.

16:30.133 --> 16:33.168
- The outside pocket.
- All right.

16:45.030 --> 16:46.432
Hey.

16:49.785 --> 16:51.319
Hey.

17:00.897 --> 17:03.173
Why are you looking at me like that?

17:03.253 --> 17:05.666
You pitched a really nice tent.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.671
Thank you.

17:12.968 --> 17:17.391
Ready. One, and two.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.549
And three. Whistle blows.

17:22.152 --> 17:25.737
Come on, come on.
Lynn, are you going to take that?

17:31.426 --> 17:33.320
- You cheated.
- Bullshit.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.519
- Lynn wins.
- Sucks to lose. Sorry.

17:36.599 --> 17:38.667
Cheetah cheats again.

17:39.603 --> 17:42.512
- Shot, please. Pour me a shot.
- Okay.

17:43.572 --> 17:46.413
I'll have one too. Make it a little easier.

17:46.493 --> 17:49.835
- Drink responsibly, shitheads.
- Cheers.

17:53.014 --> 17:54.671
- All right.
- You guys ready?

17:54.751 --> 17:57.173
- Make sure you duck when you flip over.
- Are you ready?

17:57.253 --> 17:58.810
Okay.

17:59.590 --> 18:01.678
- One.
- You'll get it next time.

18:01.758 --> 18:03.974
- Two.
- Okay.

18:09.531 --> 18:12.388
- Spoils to the winner.
- Oh, yes.

18:12.468 --> 18:14.290
Thank you.

18:14.770 --> 18:16.571
My one true love.

18:18.541 --> 18:20.306
I accept my prize.

18:23.746 --> 18:26.209
Damn. Oh, damn.

18:26.289 --> 18:28.116
Watch your step.

18:29.620 --> 18:31.174
Rude.

18:32.154 --> 18:34.355
I'm going to go get a snack.

19:00.382 --> 19:04.419
Did Jeff ever tell you about the summer
after seventh grade out here?

19:06.055 --> 19:07.889
Oh, I don't know.

19:08.757 --> 19:10.981
I think you bailed on us...

19:11.661 --> 19:14.897
...for... what was the reason again?

19:18.201 --> 19:20.089
I got my period.

19:20.669 --> 19:23.071
Wow, right. Gross.

19:24.216 --> 19:26.088
Fuck you, dude.

19:26.168 --> 19:28.610
Jeff, just don't. Don't.

19:30.345 --> 19:33.770
- Give me that.
- Oh, my God. Seriously?

19:33.850 --> 19:37.063
- Give me the fucking liquor.
- Give me the fucking liquor, scabies.

19:37.143 --> 19:38.876
Are you five years old?

19:38.956 --> 19:40.489
Maybe.

19:46.428 --> 19:49.264
Fucking great. Good work.

19:55.270 --> 19:57.593
What's her trip, man?

19:57.673 --> 19:59.475
Just talking shit.

20:02.344 --> 20:04.379
You guys got all sensitive.

20:06.615 --> 20:08.483
Should I go talk to her?

20:16.558 --> 20:18.414
I'm sorry, bro.

20:18.894 --> 20:20.762
I went too far.

20:24.199 --> 20:28.036
When did you get so sensitive on me?

21:27.696 --> 21:29.564
Can't you knock?

21:36.571 --> 21:38.428
I am sorry...

21:38.908 --> 21:41.397
...if I did something to upset you.

21:41.477 --> 21:43.344
It's not you.

21:45.881 --> 21:48.850
I guarantee that he would say
that I don't deserve you.

21:53.805 --> 21:56.241
I thought you wanted to keep a lid on it.

22:44.939 --> 22:46.507
Hey.

22:47.609 --> 22:49.177
Hey.

22:50.645 --> 22:52.480
Are you hungover?

22:53.248 --> 22:54.967
Why didn't you just tell me?

22:59.454 --> 23:01.071
Tell you what?

23:01.151 --> 23:04.759
- You and Jeff.
- Yeah, me and Jeff what?

23:08.530 --> 23:10.065
Jesus...

23:12.334 --> 23:14.204
What?

23:15.004 --> 23:17.793
Oh, my God. You know,
not that you know or care...

23:17.873 --> 23:20.407
...but I've been going through, like,
a really hard time at school lately.

23:20.487 --> 23:24.488
All I really wanted this weekend was
to have fun with my best friends, so...

23:25.881 --> 23:27.634
You're going to crush him.

23:28.684 --> 23:30.306
Yeah, okay.

23:30.386 --> 23:33.776
- Look what happened to us.
- Right, okay. Think what you want to think.

23:33.856 --> 23:37.459
You're always right.
You're always fucking right.

26:33.902 --> 26:36.091
Hey! What are you doing?

26:36.171 --> 26:38.594
- Fuck.
- Lynn, Lynn, Lynn.

26:38.674 --> 26:42.498
- Hey. Hey, just help me.
- Yeah. Babe, is it bad?

26:42.578 --> 26:44.834
- No, it's fine.
- Are you trying to ditch us?

26:44.914 --> 26:48.516
Because I'm going to tell Vic that you
can't be trusted if that's the...

26:49.951 --> 26:51.819
Come here.

26:52.253 --> 26:54.938
- Just keep quiet, okay?
- Okay.

26:55.658 --> 26:58.893
Babe, wouldn't it be a relief
if we just told him?

27:01.129 --> 27:03.652
Are you taking me to, like,
a hidden little love spot?

27:03.732 --> 27:07.135
- Even better.
- What could possibly be better?

27:14.375 --> 27:18.446
- It's fucking real.
- Holy shit, Victor's going to flip.

27:19.714 --> 27:21.237
Hey.

27:21.717 --> 27:23.551
Let's just take it.

27:25.119 --> 27:28.590
What, just ditch him? I mean, there's
nothing for, like, five miles, and...

27:32.661 --> 27:35.310
It's ours.

27:41.637 --> 27:43.505
Nice, you guys.

28:00.090 --> 28:03.065
Okay. Eight motherfucking million, Vic.

28:03.145 --> 28:05.381
It's stolen. You guys realize that, right?

28:05.461 --> 28:07.783
We get back in cell range,
we're calling the cops.

28:07.863 --> 28:09.685
I want it.

28:10.565 --> 28:13.602
You're hurt, Lynn. Look at yourself.

28:15.670 --> 28:19.273
Think about your scholarship.
That's real. This money isn't.

28:21.242 --> 28:23.466
Okay, let's... man, okay, look...

28:23.546 --> 28:26.346
...I completely understand
if you're a little upset about us.

28:26.426 --> 28:29.105
But first and foremost,
we're all still friends...

28:29.185 --> 28:32.241
...so let's just talk this out
and we can figure out our options.

28:32.321 --> 28:33.349
- I have an option.
- Yeah?

28:33.429 --> 28:37.380
Go fuck yourself. I'm not getting
killed over cartel money.

28:37.460 --> 28:40.917
- Okay, dude, it's not cartel money. Come on.
- I'm not fucking around, Jeff.

28:40.997 --> 28:42.719
- Vic...
- We need to go right now.

28:42.799 --> 28:47.339
If a ranger comes, we'll act relieved, and
then we will tell them that we found it...

28:47.419 --> 28:50.593
- I found it.
- Okay, Lynn found it. Whatever.

28:50.673 --> 28:55.247
Point being is that if we don't
come across anybody, then, well...

28:55.327 --> 28:58.200
Jesus, you guys,
that is an airtight master plan.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.636
Really, there's, like,
no way that could go wrong.

29:00.716 --> 29:02.638
Look, Vic, I get it, okay?

29:02.718 --> 29:06.241
It's crazy and it's risky as hell,
but think about your life now, man.

29:06.321 --> 29:10.646
- You pump shit for a living.
- I earn money for a living, Jeff...

29:10.726 --> 29:13.602
...something you've never had to do.
Your parents are loaded.

29:13.682 --> 29:16.284
- You don't even need this.
- I need it.

29:18.233 --> 29:20.916
- Need, or want?
- Need.

29:21.836 --> 29:25.440
- Bullshit.
- I lost my scholarship.

29:28.843 --> 29:33.489
I have been trying to get my knee in shape
for months, and now it is terminally fucked.

29:33.569 --> 29:35.554
So ask your mom for help.

29:35.634 --> 29:38.173
Dude, I've been paying her tuition.

29:38.253 --> 29:40.921
Okay, I get it.

29:41.923 --> 29:45.948
You need this cash so you don't have to
fuck Jeff for your lunch money anymore.

29:46.528 --> 29:48.421
Fuck you, dude!

29:48.501 --> 29:51.013
- Fucking asshole.
- Okay, Vic, get...

29:51.093 --> 29:54.583
- ...get off me, man.
- Shut up, Jeff.

30:01.159 --> 30:03.365
He doesn't know, does he?

30:04.245 --> 30:06.602
- Of course not.
- Okay, what don't I know?

30:06.682 --> 30:09.825
Man, you almost broke my neck.

30:09.905 --> 30:12.620
Thanks for breaking my pack.

30:19.828 --> 30:22.118
She's with me now, all right?

30:22.898 --> 30:25.834
She's mine. I won.

30:31.672 --> 30:35.264
You wanna leave? Then leave. But how do we
know you're not gonna say anything about this?

30:35.344 --> 30:38.629
I'm not gonna rat on you, Jeff.
I don't do that.

30:38.709 --> 30:42.905
I'm just out, okay?
Life is too short for this.

30:42.985 --> 30:46.875
Well, when you start second-guessing yourself
and you want to get back in on this...

30:46.955 --> 30:50.245
- ...we are going to be long gone, Vic.
- Don't worry about me.

30:50.325 --> 30:52.326
Have fun in prison.

30:54.295 --> 30:56.130
Fuck him.

30:58.166 --> 30:59.968
Let's just go.

31:20.454 --> 31:23.593
<i>Dispatch to all units. Dispatch to all units.</i>

31:23.993 --> 31:28.183
<i>Aircraft wreckage has been located.
Unoccupied at time of impact.</i>

31:28.263 --> 31:32.154
<i>Pilot wanted for embezzlement.
Approach with caution.</i>

31:33.034 --> 31:36.040
Dispatch, 0-5, copy that. 0-5 out.

32:19.180 --> 32:23.306
Okay, it's perfect. You can't see a thing.
I don't think it'll sag too much.

32:23.386 --> 32:26.542
- You sure that's going to hold?
- Yeah, it'll hold.

32:26.622 --> 32:29.311
Trust me, babe, I know what I'm doing.

32:29.791 --> 32:33.582
- We should bypass sunrise.
- What? Why? We get there, we're home free.

32:33.662 --> 32:36.718
All I have to do is call a car
and we're out by lunchtime.

32:36.798 --> 32:40.889
It's the hot party spot.
There are going to be too many eyes.

32:40.969 --> 32:44.126
Yeah, but they'll all be way too lit.
They won't even notice us. Don't sweat it.

32:44.206 --> 32:45.662
Jeff, how can I not sweat it?

32:45.742 --> 32:48.363
Do you know how far the
Houston Launch is if we went around...

32:48.443 --> 32:51.300
...or how rough the water can get
at Wilden before we even get down there?

32:51.380 --> 32:53.044
Let's be smart about this.

32:54.983 --> 32:57.440
Rabbit ear through the loop.

32:58.050 --> 33:00.455
So I'll just tie a couple knots.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.715
Snuck up on me.

33:38.493 --> 33:40.528
Cigarette man, right?

33:41.829 --> 33:43.364
Yeah.

33:44.966 --> 33:47.383
You know those things aren't gonna
make you feel better, right?

33:47.463 --> 33:49.516
Of course they will.

33:51.772 --> 33:54.596
What happened to you? You lose your friends?

33:54.676 --> 33:57.278
They're idiots.

33:59.981 --> 34:01.815
So many birds.

34:10.190 --> 34:11.547
You need some water, man?

34:11.627 --> 34:15.263
I don't want to be any trouble,
but if you got an extra bottle.

34:17.098 --> 34:19.500
Yeah, you look like hell.

34:41.656 --> 34:43.946
You got more, right?
I don't want to drink all your water.

34:44.025 --> 34:46.481
No, you're... you're good.

34:46.561 --> 34:48.596
I don't know if you recycle.

35:03.712 --> 35:06.180
Are you still pissed about what Vic said?

35:08.983 --> 35:12.653
He's not here,
so it doesn't really matter, does it?

35:16.625 --> 35:18.613
Is it left or right?

35:18.693 --> 35:21.629
- Right.
- Okay.

35:22.930 --> 35:26.187
No, right, left... it's left.

35:26.267 --> 35:28.804
Like, right. It's left.

35:29.404 --> 35:31.767
Okay, is it right or is it left?

35:31.847 --> 35:35.890
- No, no, it's right, it's right, it's right.
- It's right? This is serious.

35:35.970 --> 35:39.134
- It's right?
- Yes, it is right. Babe, we're good.

35:39.214 --> 35:41.816
Okay. Can you please not call me babe.

35:44.819 --> 35:46.855
What happened to your friends?

35:48.689 --> 35:52.715
I don't know, man.
Shit just got awkward, you know?

35:54.162 --> 35:56.764
Seemed like it was time for me to go.

35:58.132 --> 36:00.000
About a girl?

36:01.769 --> 36:03.604
You could say that.

36:05.139 --> 36:07.007
High school sweetheart?

36:11.179 --> 36:13.702
You're better off, man.
Trust me. It doesn't work out.

36:13.782 --> 36:15.637
Is that so?

36:16.317 --> 36:18.173
What's your name?

36:18.253 --> 36:21.689
- Victor.
- Let me ask you a question, Vic.

36:24.125 --> 36:28.162
What usually happens when you finally
get something that you wanted forever?

36:29.931 --> 36:33.222
It's disappointing most of the time. Right?

36:33.802 --> 36:36.203
Women are the best example of that.

36:48.949 --> 36:50.484
Jeff.

36:51.219 --> 36:52.341
What?

36:52.421 --> 36:55.978
Okay, just act casual. The launch
is just around the bend, and then...

36:56.058 --> 36:57.613
Jeff.

36:58.813 --> 37:00.949
What the fuck?

37:01.029 --> 37:05.299
All right, I will check.
I will check the bags. Just act casual.

37:24.385 --> 37:26.474
Jeff, the bag's ripped.

37:26.854 --> 37:29.257
- Shit.
- How's it going?

37:32.061 --> 37:34.183
- You all right, Goldilocks?
- Hey.

37:35.963 --> 37:38.187
I just whacked my hand
real hard with the oar...

37:38.267 --> 37:40.735
...and I'm just trying
to cool it off, you know?

37:42.970 --> 37:45.493
- Here you go.
- My hero. Thank you.

37:45.573 --> 37:48.564
Yeah, no problem. All right,
I guess I'll see you guys out there.

37:48.644 --> 37:51.332
Thank you for the paddle, sir.

37:51.412 --> 37:52.980
Bye.

37:53.581 --> 37:55.082
Bye.

37:58.352 --> 38:00.242
That girl...

38:00.922 --> 38:02.877
...Cheet? Cheater?

38:02.957 --> 38:04.980
She's got that look.

38:05.560 --> 38:07.361
Crazy look.

38:08.162 --> 38:11.186
When they get that look, you know it.

38:11.666 --> 38:15.123
You're better off without them, otherwise
you end up paying somebody else's bill...

38:15.203 --> 38:16.811
...sooner or later.

38:16.891 --> 38:19.027
Be careful.

38:19.107 --> 38:22.109
You're going to wake up one day,
you'll be married to her.

38:22.744 --> 38:25.402
And all you want to do is get the fuck out.

38:26.782 --> 38:30.584
But that little bitch will not behave
like a reasonable man.

38:33.988 --> 38:36.044
Trust me.

38:36.124 --> 38:38.714
You're better off. Let her go.

38:38.794 --> 38:41.716
You want to wake up one day
in 10 years and hear...

38:41.796 --> 38:43.632
"...you stole my youth.

38:46.767 --> 38:48.571
"You took my 20s.

38:50.804 --> 38:52.675
You took my 30s."

38:54.274 --> 38:56.278
You want to hear that shit?

39:00.147 --> 39:01.984
That's depressing.

39:07.225 --> 39:10.179
- Why are there only three?
- No, no, no, no, no!

39:10.259 --> 39:12.813
I tied a double knot.
I swear to God I tied...

39:12.893 --> 39:15.344
...you saw me tie a double knot.

39:16.065 --> 39:18.354
Oh, my God.

39:19.734 --> 39:23.138
Lynn, I'm really sorry.
I'm really, really sor...

39:25.306 --> 39:28.093
- Lynn, what are you doing?
- I'm making room.

39:28.777 --> 39:31.627
Just stop fucking touching me!

39:44.124 --> 39:46.328
Babe, are you okay?

39:48.329 --> 39:51.620
Okay, let's just take a second,
think about this.

39:51.700 --> 39:54.356
You know that you can't make it
out of here on your own.

39:54.436 --> 39:56.767
You need me, and I need you too,
and we're in this together.

39:56.847 --> 39:58.947
- Together?
- Right?

39:59.027 --> 40:02.063
You have not listened...

40:02.143 --> 40:06.201
...to one word that I have said
since we left.

40:06.781 --> 40:11.887
I said, go around sunrise,
and you take us to sunrise.

40:13.321 --> 40:17.446
And then, somehow in the middle
of that whole clusterfuck...

40:17.526 --> 40:21.284
...you lost $2 million.

40:22.497 --> 40:24.386
So, yeah...

40:25.166 --> 40:27.990
...there is only one person
who can help us get out of this...

40:28.070 --> 40:30.092
...and as much as I fucking hate it...

40:30.172 --> 40:33.943
...it is better than going
down clown shit trail with you.

40:55.930 --> 40:58.967
- You get reception up here?
- Barely.

41:03.171 --> 41:04.767
Hey...

41:05.061 --> 41:06.932
...what's that?

41:07.876 --> 41:10.279
These don't get opened, you know.
I've had them for like a year.

41:10.359 --> 41:11.900
They're stale anyways.

41:12.980 --> 41:15.383
Like I give a fuck.

41:16.283 --> 41:17.506
Can I have a smoke?

41:17.586 --> 41:20.541
I can't break the plastic.
It's like a willpower thing, you know?

41:20.621 --> 41:24.246
Are you fucking serious, man?
What kind of smoker's etiquette is that?

41:24.326 --> 41:27.480
- You have cigarettes, you give a cig...
- I'm not... I'm not a smoker.

41:31.865 --> 41:33.736
You little fucker.

41:35.252 --> 41:38.441
Cocksucking little shit.

41:48.812 --> 41:51.699
Hey! You little fuck!

42:18.747 --> 42:22.137
- Are you okay? Hang on, hang on.
- He's chasing me.

42:22.217 --> 42:25.854
- He's fucking crazy.
- Son, just relax. Lie down. Just relax.

42:27.405 --> 42:28.811
Jesus!

42:32.326 --> 42:33.849
Fuck.

42:34.429 --> 42:36.298
What the fuck?

42:37.765 --> 42:39.624
Oh, my God.

42:40.034 --> 42:41.903
Oh, man.

42:42.369 --> 42:44.206
Look at his head.

42:48.910 --> 42:51.707
Do you have a phone? Give me the phone.

42:51.787 --> 42:54.622
Well, do you want to leave him?
Look at his head!

42:55.083 --> 42:57.406
Do you want to get him help or not?

42:58.186 --> 43:02.815
Are you fucking kidding me?
What the fuck is wrong with you? Okay?

43:18.922 --> 43:21.196
What is this place called?

43:21.276 --> 43:22.845
Wilder.

43:24.411 --> 43:26.434
He knows it.

43:26.514 --> 43:28.951
The gnarliest rapids up here.

43:32.788 --> 43:34.323
Fuck.

43:38.292 --> 43:40.382
Do you know where Wilder is?

43:40.962 --> 43:43.018
You're not going to shoot me.

43:43.398 --> 43:45.322
I might.

43:45.967 --> 43:48.843
You know, Vic's going to still
want us to turn in the money.

43:48.923 --> 43:51.974
Do you ever remember him changing his mind?

43:53.674 --> 43:55.744
Like, even once?

44:03.084 --> 44:06.889
- He's coming.
- How many cops is he going to bring?

44:09.357 --> 44:14.171
Well, he emoji'd a pot of gold
and a devil's face, so maybe none.

44:15.364 --> 44:18.599
I'm telling you, I think we
should just keep it me and you.

44:19.767 --> 44:23.372
Can you just stop worrying
about me and Vic? Okay?

44:25.372 --> 44:27.609
What did he say? He was...

44:28.342 --> 44:30.365
He said something like...

44:30.795 --> 44:33.464
...I don't know the half of it, or...

44:34.481 --> 44:36.318
What does that mean?

44:36.934 --> 44:39.421
We fucked at the end of high school.

44:40.754 --> 44:43.625
I got over it, he didn't.

44:45.593 --> 44:47.662
That's what that was about.

44:53.133 --> 44:55.003
I'm going to change.

45:16.423 --> 45:20.081
So what, you were going to rendezvous
with them and split up my cash?

45:20.161 --> 45:23.766
No. I just want to fucking go home.

45:26.466 --> 45:28.503
You weren't going to take a cut?

45:32.205 --> 45:34.076
What, are you rich?

45:35.142 --> 45:37.399
No, I just don't want it.

45:37.929 --> 45:39.798
So you're stupid.

45:41.515 --> 45:43.185
Sure.

45:45.352 --> 45:47.189
I don't get it.

46:00.500 --> 46:02.223
You pissed?

46:02.303 --> 46:04.496
I'm not happy.

46:06.307 --> 46:08.564
Anything else that you're hiding?

46:09.644 --> 46:11.747
Is that not enough?

46:13.347 --> 46:15.217
Yeah, it's enough.

46:17.317 --> 46:18.853
Look...

46:20.520 --> 46:23.792
...I'm sorry, okay?

46:25.425 --> 46:28.230
What about us after all of this?

46:31.732 --> 46:34.679
We get out of here,
we're never going to see Vic again.

46:34.853 --> 46:37.960
I don't like it either,
but right now we need him.

46:52.720 --> 46:54.776
<i>How'd you think it was going
to work out with her?</i>

46:54.856 --> 46:58.246
She was pregnant, was going to have my kid.

46:58.326 --> 47:00.749
But she ended it without even telling me.

47:00.829 --> 47:03.065
I really wanted to get married.

47:04.099 --> 47:06.155
That was not what she wanted.

47:06.535 --> 47:09.490
Wait, you're working?
How much do you make an hour?

47:09.570 --> 47:12.050
I pump other people's shit for a living.

47:12.130 --> 47:14.095
- Minimum wage? Yeah.
- Minimum wage.

47:14.175 --> 47:16.976
You really thought that was gonna
be enough for Miss Thing?

47:18.646 --> 47:21.703
- I love that.
- What are you doing out here?

47:21.783 --> 47:26.007
You're fucking running around in the woods,
dressed like a goddamn Metallica roadie.

47:26.087 --> 47:28.476
- Who are you?
- I like Metallica.

47:28.556 --> 47:31.959
Everybody likes Metallica,
but who the fuck are you?

47:34.661 --> 47:36.951
I was just trying to get off the grid.

47:37.431 --> 47:41.823
What does that even mean? What do you
think you're going to be able to buy?

47:41.903 --> 47:43.438
Space.

47:44.271 --> 47:46.509
You dropped it in the fucking river.

47:49.977 --> 47:51.866
It's going to be okay, Vic.

47:52.446 --> 47:54.035
We get my money...

47:54.115 --> 47:57.952
...you can take Miss Thing
back to your one-bedroom hovel...

47:58.032 --> 48:00.491
...and you can romance her on minimum wage.

48:01.589 --> 48:04.193
And I can go off to Thailand.

48:05.592 --> 48:07.181
That sounds...

48:07.261 --> 48:10.485
...sounds really, really satisfying.

48:10.565 --> 48:13.343
Well, what are you judging it for?
I mean, I worked for that money.

48:13.423 --> 48:16.615
I mean, I didn't... I mean,
I sort of stole it, but I didn't steal it.

48:16.695 --> 48:19.661
It's a capitalist economy, right?
Fucking dog eats dog.

48:19.741 --> 48:23.031
You don't care which dog
eats which dog, but people...

48:23.111 --> 48:24.733
...we're eating dogs.

48:26.013 --> 48:29.884
Have you thought about what taking
this money actually means?

48:32.169 --> 48:34.556
We're going to have to disappear.

48:34.636 --> 48:38.046
Cut everyone off. I can do that.

48:38.126 --> 48:41.930
But your family, your parents, that's good.

48:45.399 --> 48:46.921
Good?

48:47.501 --> 48:49.457
My dad is a dick.

48:49.537 --> 48:51.439
My mom, that's...

48:51.519 --> 48:54.063
...I haven't even thought about that.

48:54.143 --> 48:58.380
This decision is going
to cut off your whole life.

48:59.813 --> 49:03.051
And you have a good life,
and you don't need this money.

49:03.884 --> 49:06.555
Lynn, look at me.

49:07.588 --> 49:09.644
I don't care about the money.

49:10.624 --> 49:12.494
I care about you.

49:15.562 --> 49:17.219
Shit.

49:17.999 --> 49:19.454
- Goddamn it.
- Come on, grab the gear.

49:19.534 --> 49:21.673
Get your fucking gear on. We have to go.

49:29.342 --> 49:30.863
Hey!

49:32.412 --> 49:35.113
- Shit.
- I want my money.

49:35.193 --> 49:37.838
- Wait a minute, he's not a ranger.
- Yeah, no fuck.

49:37.918 --> 49:40.154
Go ahead, fuck with me.

49:47.127 --> 49:50.332
- We lost one.
- What do you mean, you lost one?

49:53.901 --> 49:55.937
Just bring it up here.

50:04.978 --> 50:06.414
Hey!

50:09.684 --> 50:11.399
Shit!

50:12.902 --> 50:15.978
- Go, go, go!
- Get in the fucking boat!

50:16.758 --> 50:19.161
- Push!
- Come on, paddle.

50:20.330 --> 50:23.575
- Go! Go! Go!
- Vic, come on.

50:25.832 --> 50:27.219
Fuck.

50:33.242 --> 50:36.351
- I'm making sure the money's okay.
- I got the money!

50:36.511 --> 50:37.646
Paddle!

50:49.856 --> 50:51.479
Come on!

50:51.559 --> 50:53.561
Goddamn it!

51:08.542 --> 51:11.685
Watch it, watch it. Watch the rocks.

51:19.485 --> 51:21.322
Come on.

51:47.949 --> 51:50.438
Vic? Vic?

51:50.518 --> 51:52.586
Where are we going to go?

51:54.589 --> 51:56.677
McDonald Lake isn't far from here.

51:56.757 --> 52:00.688
And through the flatlands, I mean,
we could probably make it to town.

52:01.128 --> 52:03.793
- So we're going to make it?
- I wouldn't fucking count on it.

52:03.873 --> 52:07.035
We need to call the cops.
That guy took my phone.

52:07.635 --> 52:09.671
Mine's fucked.

52:10.471 --> 52:12.393
- Lynn?
- I... I don't fucking have mine.

52:12.473 --> 52:15.474
- Don't fuck with me, Lynn.
- Let go of my fucking bag!

52:15.554 --> 52:17.849
Take it easy. Guys, come on.

52:18.679 --> 52:20.181
Yeah?

52:23.083 --> 52:24.372
Fuck!

52:29.790 --> 52:32.112
Vic, take it easy, man.

52:32.192 --> 52:35.649
- Vic, chill out.
- Vic! Vic!

52:36.029 --> 52:39.220
- Stop!
- We are in charge here, Vic, okay?

52:39.300 --> 52:41.589
Jeff... Jeff, get off.

52:41.669 --> 52:44.258
Hey! Stop it!

52:44.638 --> 52:46.456
Stay down!

52:46.536 --> 52:48.095
Hey!

52:48.175 --> 52:51.978
This does not get us out of here. Okay?

52:52.058 --> 52:55.580
Take your fucking oar and row.

53:09.196 --> 53:10.518
What...

53:10.598 --> 53:13.076
- Go, go, go!
- Row!

53:23.243 --> 53:24.866
Lynn, come on!

53:24.966 --> 53:26.848
Oh, shit!

53:27.414 --> 53:29.483
Come on, steer!

53:33.420 --> 53:35.473
Oh, my God. That was a shot.

53:37.017 --> 53:39.597
- Come on, come on.
- Row.

53:45.358 --> 53:48.402
- Leave the money.
- Get the money.

54:01.649 --> 54:03.637
Vic! Are you okay?

54:04.784 --> 54:06.773
- It just grazed you.
- Get up! Get the bags. Get up!

54:06.853 --> 54:09.678
- It fucking hurts.
- Get the bags!

54:10.418 --> 54:12.747
- Drop the fucking money.
- I am not dropping the money!

54:12.827 --> 54:14.896
Are you kidding me?

54:17.764 --> 54:19.767
Hey, hey...

54:28.530 --> 54:30.188
Lynn!

54:32.613 --> 54:35.303
Oh, fuck. Get away. Get away.

54:35.683 --> 54:38.519
- Is she okay?
- I can run.

54:38.953 --> 54:43.361
- I can run, okay?
- You're hurt, Lynn. Look at me, I'm hurt.

54:43.441 --> 54:46.292
I will buy a new leg!

54:49.162 --> 54:50.785
What about the rabbit hole?
It's out here, isn't it?

54:50.865 --> 54:53.455
We never made it through when we
were kids 'cause you were fucking...

54:53.535 --> 54:55.524
Fucker! I'm not 8 anymore, okay?

54:55.604 --> 54:57.859
It's an old tunnel that leads
out to the cement factory.

54:57.939 --> 55:00.728
We can go there, and then we're basically
walking distance to the highway.

55:00.808 --> 55:03.454
You want to get buried alive?
You can't even use a fucking outhouse...

55:03.534 --> 55:06.174
- ...without having a panic attack.
- Okay.

55:07.314 --> 55:11.306
I've got a plan. Vic, go fuck yourself!

55:11.386 --> 55:13.220
Thank you!

55:16.223 --> 55:18.508
You are always shitting on Jeff...

55:18.588 --> 55:21.616
...trying to make yourself look like
the big man. But guess what?

55:21.696 --> 55:24.852
You are the one dumbass out of a billion...

55:24.932 --> 55:27.368
...who would pass this money up.

55:28.697 --> 55:30.758
At least Jeff has a plan.

55:30.838 --> 55:34.442
At least Jeff has fucking balls.

55:39.213 --> 55:40.669
Thank you.

56:06.140 --> 56:07.995
Hey, hey.

56:08.075 --> 56:09.910
Just give me a second.

56:49.516 --> 56:51.676
You guys are leaving a fucking trail.

56:51.756 --> 56:53.871
- Look at how close he is.
- Go!

56:54.959 --> 56:57.591
I'm sorry. Put the bag on the ground.

56:57.671 --> 57:00.215
Fuck this shit!

57:18.411 --> 57:20.715
Let's fucking go.

57:24.451 --> 57:25.773
Where...

57:25.873 --> 57:27.688
...where's Jeff?

57:44.471 --> 57:47.562
You're here. Lynn, I'm sorry.

57:47.642 --> 57:50.618
You fucking took our money
and left me in the dust.

57:50.698 --> 57:52.033
He was shooting at me.

57:52.113 --> 57:54.035
- He was shooting at all of us.
- Would you shut up?

57:54.115 --> 57:59.439
- We're in this situation because of you.
- Vic, Vic, I found it. I found it, come here.

57:59.519 --> 58:02.210
- I can't believe this.
- Well, believe it.

58:02.290 --> 58:05.415
- Why do you let her do this to you, Jeff?
- I'm not the one who got shot.

58:05.495 --> 58:08.649
This is what happens when you follow
around a fucking crazy woman.

58:08.729 --> 58:10.619
Shut up.

58:10.964 --> 58:13.401
Hipster millennial motherfuckers.

58:14.334 --> 58:17.339
- I'll go first.
- Fuck that.

58:23.542 --> 58:26.144
- I got it. I got it.
- Lynn, Jesus Christ.

58:26.224 --> 58:27.571
Fuck.

58:28.816 --> 58:30.474
Shit.

58:30.554 --> 58:32.420
Damn it.

59:07.720 --> 59:09.577
Guys, how much farther is it?

59:09.657 --> 59:12.726
I'm not going to lie, man. It's pretty far.

59:15.628 --> 59:18.700
- I don't want to die.
- Just keep moving forward.

59:21.467 --> 59:24.506
I don't want to die. I don't want to die.

59:28.975 --> 59:31.979
Lynn, slow the fuck down.

59:35.014 --> 59:36.550
Fuck.

59:36.983 --> 59:40.707
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

59:40.787 --> 59:42.323
Shit.

59:52.299 --> 59:53.988
I don't want to die.

01:00:12.892 --> 01:00:14.455
Knife!

01:00:23.363 --> 01:00:27.769
That was your big plan.

01:00:30.086 --> 01:00:33.291
Getting us matching knives?

01:00:36.593 --> 01:00:39.333
Come on, babe. Come on, he didn't know.

01:00:39.413 --> 01:00:41.524
What? He didn't know what?
He didn't know what?

01:00:41.604 --> 01:00:46.053
He didn't know what, Jeff?
He didn't know that you fucking...

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.557
...won me?

01:00:56.033 --> 01:00:57.348
Fuck!

01:01:01.033 --> 01:01:02.136
Shit!

01:01:03.569 --> 01:01:04.846
Shit.

01:01:11.648 --> 01:01:12.894
Fuck.

01:01:20.253 --> 01:01:22.056
I'll go first.

01:01:25.926 --> 01:01:27.461
Shit.

01:01:38.042 --> 01:01:39.841
You want to go next?

01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:48.782
No, I'm going to... I'm going
to get the rear. You... you go.

01:01:50.684 --> 01:01:53.120
- Give me one of those.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:01:56.523 --> 01:01:58.526
Hurry up.

01:02:00.927 --> 01:02:03.165
Be right there on the other side, all right?

01:02:29.121 --> 01:02:31.679
What the fuck am I even doing here?

01:02:31.759 --> 01:02:33.995
I'd much rather be pumping shit.

01:02:36.997 --> 01:02:41.202
It's tight and it stinks,
but you'll fit, big guy.

01:02:44.003 --> 01:02:46.607
Okay, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.

01:02:47.674 --> 01:02:49.821
You can do this, Jeff.

01:02:53.746 --> 01:02:57.185
- Piece of cake, brother.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:03:11.931 --> 01:03:13.472
Hey.

01:03:16.803 --> 01:03:19.093
Never even been tempted for a minute?

01:03:20.473 --> 01:03:22.042
No.

01:03:22.759 --> 01:03:24.596
You can do this, Jeff.

01:03:26.095 --> 01:03:27.599
You...

01:03:29.015 --> 01:03:31.038
...you could have...

01:03:31.418 --> 01:03:33.654
...anything you want.

01:03:35.988 --> 01:03:38.580
There's nothing that I want anymore.

01:03:42.211 --> 01:03:45.083
You are...

01:03:46.866 --> 01:03:49.870
...such a good guy, Vic.

01:03:52.071 --> 01:03:53.827
And where has it gotten you?

01:03:55.007 --> 01:03:57.244
Give me a fucking break, Lynn.

01:03:58.745 --> 01:04:02.370
We make it out of here,
we're going to the cops.

01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:05.139
Who put you in charge?

01:04:06.419 --> 01:04:09.062
A man was killed today. I got fucking shot.

01:04:09.142 --> 01:04:14.014
No, you got grazed. And is going to the cops
going to bring him back to life? No.

01:04:14.094 --> 01:04:17.052
You are just going to give up my money.

01:04:17.797 --> 01:04:19.587
So it's yours?

01:04:19.767 --> 01:04:21.288
Yeah.

01:04:21.618 --> 01:04:24.958
Do you want it? No.

01:04:25.038 --> 01:04:27.673
Jeff doesn't need it.
So, yeah, I think it's mine.

01:04:27.753 --> 01:04:29.673
What is wrong with you?

01:04:31.610 --> 01:04:33.480
What is wrong with me?

01:04:35.714 --> 01:04:37.802
What is wrong with me?

01:04:39.852 --> 01:04:41.923
Do you really want to know?

01:04:45.791 --> 01:04:47.628
When we were little...

01:04:49.897 --> 01:04:52.519
...we were equals, right?

01:04:52.599 --> 01:04:54.468
We were best friends.

01:04:55.134 --> 01:04:56.938
And then...

01:04:58.604 --> 01:05:00.694
...I got my fucking period...

01:05:00.774 --> 01:05:03.130
...and I grew a pair of tits...

01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:04.999
...and everything changed.

01:05:06.412 --> 01:05:10.237
I became this thing to you guys.

01:05:10.317 --> 01:05:13.240
This thing that you won.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:16.210
This thing that you like to look at...

01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:18.325
...but you didn't really like to listen to.

01:05:18.525 --> 01:05:21.292
If that is how you feel...

01:05:21.372 --> 01:05:23.971
...then why are you still friends with us?

01:05:24.051 --> 01:05:25.866
Shut up!

01:05:29.102 --> 01:05:32.139
Shut up!

01:05:36.876 --> 01:05:39.199
Don't ask me why I'm with Jeff.

01:05:39.279 --> 01:05:42.903
Don't ask me why I hate
that you both want to fuck me...

01:05:42.983 --> 01:05:44.772
...because you should both know better.

01:05:44.852 --> 01:05:49.909
Don't ask me why I am not
this perfect fucking thing...

01:05:49.989 --> 01:05:52.239
...that you want me to be.

01:05:52.319 --> 01:05:55.151
And don't ask me why I have...

01:05:55.231 --> 01:05:59.285
...failed at everything
that I have ever wanted to do.

01:06:03.237 --> 01:06:07.094
And stop fucking asking me...

01:06:07.174 --> 01:06:11.065
...why I need this money, okay?

01:06:11.745 --> 01:06:15.236
You patronizing dick.

01:06:17.784 --> 01:06:19.306
Jeff!

01:06:19.386 --> 01:06:22.142
Get my money through the damn hole...

01:06:22.222 --> 01:06:24.426
...or we are leaving you!

01:06:27.713 --> 01:06:32.533
All right, Lynnie, get your fucking money.
I'm sure it'll solve all of your problems.

01:06:37.237 --> 01:06:40.059
Hurry the fuck up, Jeff!

01:06:40.139 --> 01:06:41.642
Okay.

01:07:36.163 --> 01:07:39.454
Jeff, get my fucking money
out of there, or we're leaving you.

01:07:39.534 --> 01:07:41.688
All right, all right, hold on.

01:07:41.768 --> 01:07:43.170
Finally.

01:07:44.737 --> 01:07:46.960
Jeff, it's stuck.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:49.062
Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

01:07:49.142 --> 01:07:50.898
Get it unstuck!

01:07:51.008 --> 01:07:53.214
Hold on, it's around my neck.

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:04.740
- Let go of it.
- What? Jesus!

01:08:08.461 --> 01:08:10.739
- Come on now.
- Get...

01:08:11.769 --> 01:08:13.266
...out!

01:08:22.741 --> 01:08:25.786
- That didn't sound good.
- Fucking shut up.

01:08:30.816 --> 01:08:32.743
You fucking greedy little bitch.

01:08:32.823 --> 01:08:36.728
- You... you fucking pig.
- Put the money down.

01:08:36.808 --> 01:08:39.481
Do you want your fucking money?
You want your fucking money?

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.948
- Good fucking luck!
- Want to keep this going?

01:08:42.029 --> 01:08:45.019
You're gonna be stuck in there
for a long time, motherfucker.

01:08:45.099 --> 01:08:46.831
All right.

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:13.194
Shit.

01:09:20.265 --> 01:09:21.854
Shit.

01:09:22.234 --> 01:09:24.671
- Where's Jeff?
- Jeff...

01:09:25.371 --> 01:09:27.683
- ...he's stuck.
- You left him?

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:30.810
He's... he's freaking out. I don't know.

01:09:31.477 --> 01:09:35.314
- Go check on him.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

01:09:36.314 --> 01:09:38.185
Oh, shit.

01:09:38.835 --> 01:09:41.408
Fuck. Fuck.

01:09:41.488 --> 01:09:43.055
Shit.

01:10:02.875 --> 01:10:05.078
What the fuck?

01:10:06.178 --> 01:10:10.051
Jesus Christ.
Did she fucking bury you in here?

01:10:19.325 --> 01:10:21.843
- Hi, Vic.
- Jesus! Fuck!

01:11:01.533 --> 01:11:03.070
Shit.

01:11:04.436 --> 01:11:06.012
Hey!

01:11:06.838 --> 01:11:08.361
Hey!

01:11:08.441 --> 01:11:10.945
Hey, if you're going to come, come.

01:11:12.478 --> 01:11:14.048
Hurry.

01:11:20.586 --> 01:11:22.422
Come on.

01:11:26.755 --> 01:11:28.215
Shit.

01:11:28.695 --> 01:11:31.467
Hurry. Oh, God. Jesus.

01:11:38.704 --> 01:11:40.965
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:11:42.474 --> 01:11:43.801
Lynn?

01:11:45.451 --> 01:11:47.152
Hey!

01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:55.388
You are just a terrible, terrible person.

01:13:55.006 --> 01:13:56.577
Please!

01:14:16.562 --> 01:14:18.450
Gotta admit...

01:14:18.672 --> 01:14:20.488
...I'm impressed.

01:14:20.867 --> 01:14:22.655
You really went all in.

01:14:23.435 --> 01:14:26.207
You really leaned into it, didn't you?

01:14:29.543 --> 01:14:31.292
You're a bad little bitch.

01:14:46.158 --> 01:14:47.911
Please don't kill me.

01:14:47.991 --> 01:14:49.563
Stop it.

01:14:59.531 --> 01:15:01.678
All right, kid, where's the rest of it?

01:15:04.059 --> 01:15:05.676
Give me a cigarette.

01:15:11.717 --> 01:15:13.253
Sure.

01:15:23.161 --> 01:15:24.998
I didn't know you smoked.

01:15:31.086 --> 01:15:32.801
Where is it?

01:15:34.072 --> 01:15:36.362
You know what I did for this money.

01:15:37.042 --> 01:15:39.479
What did you do to get this money?

01:15:40.813 --> 01:15:43.671
- All sorts of horrible shit.
- Yeah?

01:15:44.051 --> 01:15:46.674
You know, they say every banker is a bandit.

01:15:47.354 --> 01:15:48.876
Yeah.

01:15:50.316 --> 01:15:53.508
Stop looking at me
like any of this is my fault.

01:15:53.588 --> 01:15:56.420
I know we're in a pretty fucked situation.

01:15:59.765 --> 01:16:01.601
Don't you think?

01:16:03.118 --> 01:16:05.723
We're in a pretty fucked situation.

01:16:07.213 --> 01:16:10.676
So, look, you need me to find that money.

01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:13.800
And I need that money to live.

01:16:14.730 --> 01:16:17.521
- You want to make a deal?
- A deal?

01:16:19.218 --> 01:16:20.940
Sure, what do you got?

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:22.580
I...

01:16:23.452 --> 01:16:25.726
...will show you where the money is...

01:16:27.659 --> 01:16:29.929
...and just give me some of it.

01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:35.622
Just give me... just give me
back my backpack...

01:16:35.702 --> 01:16:38.982
...and I will take you to the fucking money.

01:16:39.062 --> 01:16:43.530
- Shake hands, part ways, say no more?
- And we go our separate ways, and...

01:16:43.610 --> 01:16:45.832
Never, never to be talked about again?

01:16:45.912 --> 01:16:48.748
No. No.

01:16:54.119 --> 01:16:56.373
Thinking maybe counter offering
maybe like five grand?

01:16:56.453 --> 01:16:59.485
Are you going to fucking insult me like that?

01:16:59.565 --> 01:17:02.088
You really should look at yourself.

01:17:02.168 --> 01:17:05.472
I mean, you're a mess.
You're twenty... what, 22 years old?

01:17:05.552 --> 01:17:09.188
Entitled, bitter, angry.

01:17:09.618 --> 01:17:12.092
You want me to fucking beg right now?

01:17:12.172 --> 01:17:14.795
You want me to get on my fucking knees...

01:17:15.675 --> 01:17:18.998
...and beg you to not kill me?

01:17:19.078 --> 01:17:21.548
Please don't kill me.

01:17:23.249 --> 01:17:28.518
Please don't kill me. I'll do anything
you want me to do. Yeah, fuck that!

01:17:43.251 --> 01:17:45.871
- Stop!
- Hey! Get off me!

01:18:36.888 --> 01:18:38.691
I'm getting help.

01:18:45.914 --> 01:18:47.734
I'm sorry.
