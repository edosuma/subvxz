WEBVTT

00:01.398 --> 00:04.301
I'm Dr. Jason Bull.
I'm not a lawyer.

00:04.304 --> 00:07.300
I'm an expert in what's
called trial science.

00:07.302 --> 00:11.337
I study a jury's behavioral patterns.

00:11.339 --> 00:14.228
I know what they're
thinking before they do.

00:15.243 --> 00:18.645
Everything my team learns
gets plugged into a matrix,

00:18.647 --> 00:21.347
which allows us to
assemble a mirror jury

00:21.349 --> 00:24.931
that is scary in its
predictive efficiency.

00:26.788 --> 00:29.718
The verdict you get depends on me.

00:29.721 --> 00:32.500
And that's no bull.

00:36.398 --> 00:38.506
Vitals are crashing. We're losing her.

00:38.509 --> 00:39.916
Where's that O-neg?!

00:39.919 --> 00:41.838
Another bag? Pressure's not coming up.

00:41.841 --> 00:42.986
Second bag coming up.

00:42.989 --> 00:44.337
Femoral artery is lacerated.

00:44.339 --> 00:45.694
She's a hemophiliac.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.158
She'll bleed out before it gets here.

00:47.161 --> 00:48.338
Plasma. Factor VIII and Factor IX.

00:48.341 --> 00:49.549
It won't work. Kyra's anti-bodies

00:49.552 --> 00:50.916
reject standard clotting factors.

00:50.919 --> 00:51.978
She's my sister. I can help.

00:51.980 --> 00:53.533
You have to use this.

00:53.536 --> 00:54.647
You can't be back here.

00:54.649 --> 00:56.415
- Hey!
- Hey! Security!

00:56.418 --> 00:58.462
Get her out of here.

00:58.465 --> 01:00.153
Ma'am?

01:00.155 --> 01:01.287
What did you give her?

01:01.289 --> 01:02.486
She's stabilizing.

01:02.489 --> 01:03.775
That's impossible.

01:03.778 --> 01:05.992
EP's dropping.

01:05.994 --> 01:07.126
Ten, 140.

01:07.128 --> 01:09.095
She's such a klutz.

01:09.097 --> 01:11.097
- 130.
- What are you waiting for?

01:11.100 --> 01:12.527
Stitch up my sister.

01:15.270 --> 01:17.270
Tray's ready, Doctor.

01:17.272 --> 01:19.772
The Angel of New York Sacred Heart.

01:19.774 --> 01:22.809
Now, that's how some people
are describing Kerry Ketchum.

01:22.811 --> 01:24.444
Only 25 years old,

01:24.446 --> 01:27.780
with advanced degrees in
chemistry and molecular biology,

01:27.782 --> 01:31.451
but no formal medical training,
she saved her sister's life

01:31.453 --> 01:34.787
with a drug she developed
in her own small lab.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:43.485 --> 01:45.452
How deep down the
rabbit hole are you?

01:45.454 --> 01:48.588
I'm the Mad Hatter, Danny.
I'm in Wonderland.

01:48.590 --> 01:50.357
She's the perfect client.

01:50.359 --> 01:51.791
The hospital won't press charges.

01:51.793 --> 01:53.526
Too many people worshipping at the altar

01:53.528 --> 01:54.894
of the Angel of Sacred Heart.

01:54.896 --> 01:56.563
Who would besmirch an angel?

01:56.565 --> 01:57.731
It's blasphemy.

01:57.733 --> 01:59.833
The hospital wants her
hemophilia B cure.

01:59.835 --> 02:01.701
A lot of hospitals do...
all over the country.

02:01.703 --> 02:03.903
she offered
to give it to them.

02:03.905 --> 02:06.673
- What do you mean give it to them?
- She means give for free.

02:06.675 --> 02:08.640
- For no money?
- Must be some money.

02:08.666 --> 02:12.172
Well, cost, but that's
basically free, and because

02:12.197 --> 02:13.780
she's attempting to
distribute nationwide,

02:13.782 --> 02:15.624
this guy Windemere is suing her.

02:15.649 --> 02:19.252
Errol Windemere, CEO of
WindGen Pharmaceuticals says

02:19.254 --> 02:22.055
he holds the patent to
Kerry's drug. He's filing,

02:22.057 --> 02:23.857
saying she's infringing.

02:23.859 --> 02:25.992
And this is the part Bull's gonna love.

02:25.994 --> 02:28.962
You're this excited about a
patent case? Why?

02:28.964 --> 02:31.031
Even though Kerry
Ketchum lives in New York,

02:31.033 --> 02:34.334
because she's offering the drug
all over, including Texas,

02:34.336 --> 02:38.538
that just opened her up to
the jurisdiction of Callisto.

02:40.942 --> 02:42.907
Who's Callisto?

02:42.962 --> 02:44.530
Callisto isn't a who.

02:44.555 --> 02:47.378
Callisto is a where.

02:47.403 --> 02:50.904
Geographically situated in West Texas.

02:50.906 --> 02:53.307
Population 25,000.

02:53.309 --> 02:55.042
But in the legal world, it's located

02:55.044 --> 02:57.778
somewhere between the sixth
and seventh circles of hell.

02:57.780 --> 02:58.741
I take it

02:58.788 --> 03:00.147
you've been there before?

03:00.149 --> 03:01.304
Yeah.

03:01.329 --> 03:03.183
Once.

03:03.185 --> 03:06.620
Don't let its quaint
appearance fool you.

03:06.622 --> 03:10.257
Callisto is a litigation speed trap.

03:10.259 --> 03:12.793
They've made a cottage
industry out of patent cases.

03:12.795 --> 03:14.895
- How?
- Well, the jury always sides

03:14.897 --> 03:17.130
with the plaintiffs, and they hand out

03:17.132 --> 03:20.300
the biggest cash verdicts
in all the country.

03:20.302 --> 03:22.466
These plaintiffs,
they hire the local law firm.

03:22.491 --> 03:24.261
And the juries well, they know,

03:24.263 --> 03:25.736
and they like these local lawyers.

03:25.761 --> 03:27.855
And so, if they represent the plaintiffs,

03:27.857 --> 03:29.624
the plaintiffs must be right.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.726
That sounds wildly unfair.

03:31.728 --> 03:33.561
It's called the Halo Effect.

03:34.463 --> 03:37.165
Juries apply their love
of local lawyers to

03:37.167 --> 03:39.834
whoever they represent.

03:39.836 --> 03:44.005
So how did you beat them the last time?

03:44.007 --> 03:45.907
I didn't.

03:46.976 --> 03:50.011
But-but I thought you've never lost.

03:50.013 --> 03:51.712
Doesn't mean I've always won.

03:51.714 --> 03:53.581
Callisto.

03:56.186 --> 03:57.622
I don't even have a lawyer yet.

03:57.647 --> 03:59.831
I can't go to trial.

03:59.856 --> 04:01.689
In Texas?

04:01.691 --> 04:02.895
This is totally unfair.

04:02.920 --> 04:05.827
Kerry, it's way worse than that.

04:05.829 --> 04:08.096
Windemere has all the
leverage of a crooked system,

04:08.098 --> 04:09.564
and he's using it against you.

04:09.566 --> 04:10.798
Can you tell us

04:10.800 --> 04:12.834
- about your drug?
- The challenge of hemophilia B

04:12.836 --> 04:15.002
is not just synthesizing
a clotting factor.

04:15.004 --> 04:17.872
It's delivering that factor in
a way the body won't reject.

04:17.874 --> 04:19.173
My sister's disease

04:19.175 --> 04:21.909
affects fewer than one in 50,000 people.

04:21.911 --> 04:24.679
There are some treatments,
but it's not a big enough market

04:24.681 --> 04:25.913
for large pharmaceutical companies

04:25.915 --> 04:27.915
to invest in developing a cure.

04:27.917 --> 04:29.627
They'd call what I make an "orphan drug."

04:29.652 --> 04:31.052
So you've done this out of love.

04:31.077 --> 04:32.820
Devoted my entire life to a cure.

04:32.822 --> 04:34.422
But WindGen Pharmaceuticals claims

04:34.424 --> 04:37.558
that their patented hemophilia B
treatment covers your invention.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.627
They haven't advanced
that drug in 17 years.

04:39.629 --> 04:42.730
It has to be used once a
week to have any effect.

04:42.732 --> 04:44.699
Mine lasts a year and doesn't wear off.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.701
Thousands of people
could live better lives.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.102
That sound different enough to you?

04:48.104 --> 04:50.404
But the question is how
it sounds to a jury.

04:50.406 --> 04:52.240
The technicalities of
patent law are very complex.

04:52.242 --> 04:54.275
I'm sorry, I don't see technicalities.

04:54.277 --> 04:55.943
I see my sister slip

04:55.945 --> 04:57.512
cutting a bagel, and spending a month

04:57.514 --> 04:59.247
- in the ICU.
- And in this case,

04:59.249 --> 05:01.549
Windemere himself is
showing up to testify.

05:02.418 --> 05:04.452
He's on the witness list.

05:04.454 --> 05:05.620
Why?

05:05.622 --> 05:06.821
I don't know.

05:06.846 --> 05:09.272
Maybe 'cause he's a heartless,
money-grubbing old douche.

05:09.297 --> 05:11.125
Works for me.

05:11.127 --> 05:13.961
So I take it we're going.

05:13.963 --> 05:16.249
Yeah, Bull, I've only
got a foggy picture

05:16.274 --> 05:18.466
of what happened to you in
Callisto the first time round,

05:18.468 --> 05:20.535
but I have heard you

05:20.537 --> 05:22.637
say the words "deep
personal downward spiral"

05:22.639 --> 05:24.839
in referencing its aftermath.

05:24.841 --> 05:27.708
Lot of good can come from a
deep personal downward spiral.

05:27.710 --> 05:31.179
From the bottom of a hole,
it's easy to see the light.

05:32.315 --> 05:34.081
Good to go.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.751
Bull, I-I can't get ahold of Danny.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.320
Yeah, she's on special assignment.

05:39.322 --> 05:42.790
- Care to elaborate?
- Um, not now.

05:42.792 --> 05:44.559
Can I have everyone's attention?

05:44.561 --> 05:47.161
I have a request of each
and every one of you.

05:47.163 --> 05:48.362
I want you to imagine

05:48.364 --> 05:50.932
we are an invading hostile force.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.067
Because that is how the devil's armpit

05:53.069 --> 05:55.436
that we are traveling
to is gonna see us.

05:55.438 --> 05:58.806
And I may not be able to
share every tiny detail

05:58.808 --> 06:01.142
of strategy with you in the moment.

06:01.144 --> 06:04.246
Trust that... I am your general...

06:05.448 --> 06:07.515
...and I am in full command.

06:09.886 --> 06:12.820
Bull, you may be making
too big a deal of this.

06:12.822 --> 06:14.622
I'm not, and that's a perfect example

06:14.624 --> 06:16.473
of the opposite of what I just said.

06:16.498 --> 06:18.059
We got this, Bull.

06:18.061 --> 06:20.328
- Carry-on only, Chunk.
- Okay.

06:20.330 --> 06:22.151
See, now you're just talking crazy.

06:22.176 --> 06:23.898
Just get what you need
when you're down there.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.666
How...?

06:25.668 --> 06:28.135
- What's up?
- Cable,

06:28.137 --> 06:29.770
you're staying here.

06:29.772 --> 06:32.106
Could have just punched me in the face.

06:33.843 --> 06:37.545
It's nothing personal,
but I need you on the outside.

06:41.017 --> 06:44.685
All right, so, every attempt at doing

06:44.687 --> 06:46.387
what we do will be
undermined from the second

06:46.389 --> 06:49.090
we step off that plane,
we're gonna be sabotaged.

06:49.092 --> 06:50.358
But...

06:50.360 --> 06:53.894
we are on the side of the better angel.

06:53.896 --> 06:56.097
It's gonna be fun.

06:57.300 --> 07:00.167
Nah. He's not losing it.

07:17.720 --> 07:19.754
They gave away our conference area.

07:19.756 --> 07:21.856
How are we supposed to have mock trials?

07:21.858 --> 07:24.391
- We don't have a workspace.
- Or rooms.

07:24.416 --> 07:27.413
The concierge apologized
for losing our reservations.

07:27.438 --> 07:29.697
If I wasn't carrying bags,
I'd throw up air quotes.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.332
At least you have your bags.

07:31.334 --> 07:34.503
The airport porter said
he couldn't find mine.

07:36.506 --> 07:39.040
I'll never question you again.

07:39.042 --> 07:42.291
See the park bench?

07:43.016 --> 07:44.485
Banners all around town?

07:44.981 --> 07:46.447
Those same names are on the local

07:46.449 --> 07:48.049
high school football stadium.

07:48.051 --> 07:53.054
All generous donations courtesy
of Bender, Lindsay & Partners.

07:53.056 --> 07:53.931
Who are they?

07:53.956 --> 07:56.023
Counsel for the plaintiff, the local firm.

07:56.025 --> 07:57.224
But don't worry.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.097
We also have local counsel.

07:59.122 --> 08:01.040
It's part of our strategy
to undercut their advantage.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.397
- Someone from another firm?
- Not quite.

08:03.399 --> 08:04.699
And don't worry about
where we're gonna prep.

08:04.701 --> 08:06.400
I've made arrangements.

08:06.425 --> 08:08.697
Callisto's not gonna catch
me with my pants down again.

08:13.309 --> 08:14.709
Right on time.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.010
JB?

08:16.012 --> 08:18.813
How about it? Hey, welcome back, man.

08:18.815 --> 08:20.247
- Merle the Pearl.
- Right.

08:20.249 --> 08:21.882
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

08:21.884 --> 08:23.784
All right. Merle, this is my team.

08:23.786 --> 08:25.720
Team, this is Merle Deavers.

08:25.722 --> 08:29.023
Local baseball star, prom king, war vet,

08:29.025 --> 08:30.624
and handyman.

08:30.626 --> 08:33.828
Yeah, well, I'm a jack of some
trades. But come on, y'all.

08:33.830 --> 08:35.296
Everybody pile in.
Here, let me take that for you.

08:35.298 --> 08:36.664
All right.

08:37.447 --> 08:39.866
- All right.
- Here.

08:42.038 --> 08:43.504
Well, it's nice to meet y'all.

08:43.506 --> 08:45.790
You know, last time
JB came through solo.

08:45.815 --> 08:48.242
Not a phone call, not a letter?

08:48.244 --> 08:49.710
You could have let us know

08:49.712 --> 08:51.212
you were back in town, Dr. Bull.

08:51.214 --> 08:52.646
You knew we were coming, Diana.

08:52.648 --> 08:53.588
Hey there, Merle.

08:53.613 --> 08:54.761
You taking good care of
these out-of-towners?

08:54.785 --> 08:56.432
- Yeah, sure thing, Ms. Lindsay.
- All right.

08:56.456 --> 08:59.687
Now I didn't think I'd see
your face again, Bull.

08:59.689 --> 09:00.855
You made a good decision,

09:00.857 --> 09:02.556
getting rid of the old soup strainer.

09:02.558 --> 09:03.858
I always did

09:03.860 --> 09:05.962
find those whiskers ticklish.

09:05.987 --> 09:07.805
Bull had a mustache?

09:07.830 --> 09:10.564
All right, y'all.

09:10.566 --> 09:13.000
Diana Lindsay,

09:13.002 --> 09:15.403
senior partner at Bender, Lindsay

09:15.405 --> 09:17.605
She's prosecuting Kerry's case.

09:17.607 --> 09:19.140
Just on a reconnaissance mission.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.593
Wants to see who she's up against.

09:23.546 --> 09:27.314
So... Callisto is a kind of a who.

09:35.428 --> 09:38.938
This is where we're staying?

09:38.940 --> 09:42.409
Lot of hay, no livestock.

09:42.411 --> 09:44.511
There definitely has been
at some point, though.

09:44.513 --> 09:46.502
Yeah, picked up your,
crates yesterday night.

09:46.527 --> 09:47.941
Came to my name like you said.

09:47.966 --> 09:49.749
Nobody messed with 'em
and I made a list

09:49.751 --> 09:52.519
of my friends and relations
for your mock juror pool.

09:52.521 --> 09:53.987
Folks who won't go blabbing
what you ask 'em about.

09:53.989 --> 09:55.989
We'll need to determine how well

09:55.991 --> 09:58.558
Kerry's narrative cuts
through the Halo Effect.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.960
See if the jury will
like her more than Diana.

10:00.962 --> 10:03.541
- Sweep it first.
- Excuse me?

10:03.566 --> 10:05.432
- For bugs.
- Bugs?

10:05.434 --> 10:06.956
You mean electronic
surveillance devices?

10:06.980 --> 10:08.346
I do, indeed.

10:08.349 --> 10:09.482
But that's not legal.

10:09.484 --> 10:10.683
Now you're catching on.

10:10.685 --> 10:12.218
Kerry, with me.

10:14.022 --> 10:16.455
Hi. Huge fan of your work.

10:16.457 --> 10:18.224
And your lack of respect for authority.

10:18.226 --> 10:19.525
Hi.

10:19.527 --> 10:21.060
So I've been tasked with
finding the connection

10:21.062 --> 10:22.395
between Windemere and you.

10:22.397 --> 10:24.397
And I got my hands on his research study

10:24.399 --> 10:26.465
from 1999 that led to the patent.

10:26.467 --> 10:27.440
The participants' names

10:27.465 --> 10:29.468
as well as some of the
details from the experiments

10:29.470 --> 10:32.405
were confidential, but Windemere himself

10:32.407 --> 10:33.606
was the lead researcher.

10:33.608 --> 10:35.675
And this might explain why
he's coming to testify.

10:35.677 --> 10:38.577
Windemere is taking the position
that he invented your drug.

10:38.579 --> 10:40.813
No, he didn't invent my drug.
They're not the same.

10:40.815 --> 10:43.082
No, I know, but he's going
to say that he did.

10:43.084 --> 10:44.617
Thank you, Cable.

10:44.619 --> 10:46.953
I'll take it from here.

10:46.955 --> 10:48.788
She's very enthusiastic.

10:52.327 --> 10:56.162
Kerry, your cure is
composed of distinct elements

10:56.164 --> 10:57.596
of Windemere's patent.

10:57.598 --> 10:59.031
But I beat his science.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.599
Luckily, this isn't about science.

11:00.601 --> 11:02.501
It's about people.

11:02.503 --> 11:05.438
And the people on this jury
are not gonna understand

11:05.440 --> 11:08.107
any of this.

11:08.109 --> 11:09.842
So we need to stick to the plan.

11:09.844 --> 11:11.110
And that is?

11:11.112 --> 11:14.013
The good people of
Callisto on the jury...

11:14.015 --> 11:16.349
love the other side.

11:16.351 --> 11:19.819
We just have to make them love us more.

11:19.821 --> 11:21.354
Create our own halo.

11:21.356 --> 11:23.756
We can conflict out anyone
who's already served

11:23.758 --> 11:24.957
on Windemere's jury.

11:24.959 --> 11:28.127
That only leaves about 180...
eligible jurors.

11:28.129 --> 11:29.161
Danny?

11:29.163 --> 11:30.429
Hi.

11:30.431 --> 11:32.310
This is Danny's
special assignment.

11:32.335 --> 11:33.265
I'm Courtney Jean,

11:33.267 --> 11:35.368
- your waitress.
- You new to town?

11:35.370 --> 11:36.902
I just started.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.304
Still getting to know the regulars.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.505
Never seen you before.

11:39.507 --> 11:41.774
Are you all here for the
Windemere case? I have heard

11:41.776 --> 11:43.409
so much about it. Everyone's so excited

11:43.411 --> 11:44.643
to meet the man.

11:44.645 --> 11:46.612
Well, okay,

11:46.614 --> 11:48.515
I'll be right back to take your orders.

11:53.955 --> 11:54.887
What are those?

11:54.889 --> 11:55.855
Dossiers on our

11:55.857 --> 11:57.156
potential jurors.

11:57.158 --> 11:59.725
She's not a waitress, is she?

11:59.727 --> 12:01.745
She's with us. Former FBI.

12:01.770 --> 12:03.572
I kind of hope she keeps that accent.

12:03.597 --> 12:04.830
These juror backgrounds

12:04.832 --> 12:06.832
are very useful, but...

12:06.834 --> 12:07.967
this voir dire's gonna be different.

12:07.969 --> 12:11.170
These jurors are gonna trust one lawyer

12:11.172 --> 12:13.072
more than the other.

12:13.074 --> 12:15.007
Ours or theirs.

12:15.009 --> 12:16.442
And when do we meet our attorney?

12:16.444 --> 12:18.177
We already have.

12:18.179 --> 12:19.912
Hey.

12:19.914 --> 12:21.347
The judge wrapped his other case early.

12:21.349 --> 12:23.024
He wants us to do our
voir dire right now.

12:23.049 --> 12:23.644
All right.

12:23.669 --> 12:26.252
Now, everyone knows
everyone in this courthouse,

12:26.254 --> 12:28.277
so... it's gonna be weird.

12:28.302 --> 12:29.822
Chunk, I'm gonna need
your Southern charm.

12:29.824 --> 12:31.557
Never leave home without it.

12:31.559 --> 12:33.392
Don't forget to tip your waitress.

12:33.394 --> 12:35.728
You sure about this?

12:35.730 --> 12:37.530
Merle's our attorney?

12:37.532 --> 12:40.199
We need a bigger halo.

12:40.201 --> 12:42.501
Here comes Mr. Popularity himself.

12:42.503 --> 12:44.203
Well, I was the runner-up.

12:44.205 --> 12:46.439
But, Carl Crenshaw moved to Dallas.

12:46.441 --> 12:47.973
People around here don't
like it much when you leave.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.875
I never realized that you practiced law.

12:49.877 --> 12:51.777
Well, mostly estate
planning, property law.

12:51.779 --> 12:54.547
I did have a sticky
probate a few years back.

12:54.549 --> 12:56.348
You ever tried a case in
front of a jury?

12:56.350 --> 12:57.917
Nope.

12:59.921 --> 13:01.620
Everybody loves Merle.

13:01.622 --> 13:03.289
Which is why we need him.

13:03.291 --> 13:05.658
Okay, game faces, everyone.

13:06.988 --> 13:08.794
It's not too late to back out.

13:11.099 --> 13:13.499
I hate lawyers.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.800
All rise.

13:14.802 --> 13:16.268
Anyone having matters in the court

13:16.270 --> 13:18.337
- of Callisto, Texas...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Louis,

13:18.339 --> 13:21.600
save it. Twitter gal said there
may be a storm rolling in.

13:21.625 --> 13:22.475
Let's go.

13:22.477 --> 13:24.610
Judge Albert Darling presiding.

13:25.713 --> 13:27.012
Ms. Lindsay,

13:27.014 --> 13:28.581
- let's get started.
- Well, Your Honor,

13:28.583 --> 13:30.416
I'd first like to
acknowledge defense counsel

13:30.418 --> 13:31.617
Merle Deavers.

13:31.619 --> 13:33.119
Never seen him in court before.

13:33.121 --> 13:35.187
It is like seeing a dog drive a tractor.

13:36.591 --> 13:39.376
Well, thanks....

13:39.401 --> 13:40.860
and you know, for what it's worth,

13:40.862 --> 13:42.228
I had a Labrador

13:42.230 --> 13:43.762
that could steer a motorcycle.

13:43.764 --> 13:47.199
Now, he had a terrible sense
of direction, but,

13:47.201 --> 13:48.868
the ride was always fun.

13:50.095 --> 13:53.405
All right. Let's get this done.

13:53.407 --> 13:55.508
How's your hot water
heater working, Mary?

13:55.510 --> 13:56.709
Fine, Merle.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.377
That thermocoupler you replaced

13:58.379 --> 13:59.645
is holding up well.

13:59.647 --> 14:00.980
Good, good.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.215
Acceptable to defense.

14:03.217 --> 14:05.084
Ethan, remind me...

14:05.086 --> 14:06.952
You served on two juries last year?

14:06.954 --> 14:09.155
Yes, ma'am. Found for
the plaintiffs both times.

14:12.827 --> 14:15.736
Hey, did that calico get out again?

14:15.761 --> 14:18.430
No, no, no, she's warming up
to the kids. And they love her.

14:18.432 --> 14:20.499
Thank you for finding her, Merle.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.402
Shoot.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.037
Tornado warning.

14:25.039 --> 14:26.605
You got to be kidding me.

14:26.630 --> 14:28.137
All right, everybody,

14:28.162 --> 14:29.708
we got to get downstairs.

14:29.710 --> 14:31.544
Who's left that thinks
they can be impartial?

14:31.546 --> 14:33.045
All right, Debbie,

14:33.047 --> 14:35.181
Len, Kelly-Anne,

14:35.183 --> 14:37.483
Doug... you're all in. I promise

14:37.485 --> 14:40.019
we'll get this wrapped up by
the weekend, Jerry,

14:40.021 --> 14:43.155
so you won't have to cancel that
fishing trip. You're in, too.

14:43.157 --> 14:45.658
That's our jury. Let's move.

14:45.660 --> 14:47.359
Everybody down in the shelter.

14:48.529 --> 14:49.796
Come on in.

14:51.632 --> 14:52.965
Hey, Bulldog.

14:52.967 --> 14:55.734
You played defensive
back at Georgia, right?

14:55.736 --> 14:58.237
Yeah. Hey, nice memory.

14:58.239 --> 15:00.206
A&M. Special teams.

15:00.208 --> 15:01.907
Man, I drilled you once.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.344
How could I forget?

15:05.346 --> 15:07.213
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you.

15:07.215 --> 15:08.480
Happens all the time.

15:08.482 --> 15:09.949
Rarely gets above a category two.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.084
I'm sure it'll blow over.

15:13.187 --> 15:15.120
You know,

15:15.122 --> 15:18.057
while we're here we could talk
about settlement if you want.

15:20.061 --> 15:22.061
Doesn't seem an appropriate
conversation to have

15:22.063 --> 15:24.363
in front of the entire jury.

15:24.365 --> 15:26.398
But you do want to have it?

15:26.400 --> 15:28.434
If you would like to discuss

15:28.436 --> 15:30.436
your absentee client's position,

15:30.438 --> 15:32.271
I'd be happy to.

15:32.273 --> 15:34.440
Drinks later?

15:36.143 --> 15:38.310
Okay.

15:47.955 --> 15:49.255
Cute.

15:49.257 --> 15:51.090
Of course I remember.

15:51.092 --> 15:53.492
The dispute was over the rights

15:53.494 --> 15:55.928
- to a piece of farming equipment.
- Right.

15:55.930 --> 15:59.131
It was a money job for you.
You weren't emotionally invested.

15:59.133 --> 16:00.566
Till you lost.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.736
I did not win.

16:03.738 --> 16:05.571
Watch out, Dr. Bull, if
you come back here

16:05.573 --> 16:07.139
to settle some imaginary score.

16:07.141 --> 16:09.742
The client needs me.

16:09.744 --> 16:11.010
So I'm here.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.278
Really?

16:12.280 --> 16:15.047
Is that what it takes to get
you to come back here...

16:15.049 --> 16:16.915
A woman in need?

16:16.917 --> 16:20.052
Is there some kind of
gravitational force

16:20.054 --> 16:21.687
that prevents you from leaving Callisto?

16:24.091 --> 16:25.624
Now, you're thinking
about spreading a rumor

16:25.626 --> 16:29.161
that I'm gonna pull up
stakes and abandon my people.

16:29.163 --> 16:33.065
Now, maybe they turn against me?

16:33.067 --> 16:35.601
I'm onto your strategy, darlin'.

16:35.603 --> 16:37.970
My town, my people...

16:37.972 --> 16:39.672
my jury.

16:39.674 --> 16:42.107
Now, you better hope your
little Angel of Sacred Heart

16:42.109 --> 16:44.310
doesn't have a broken wing.

16:49.150 --> 16:51.016
What?

16:51.018 --> 16:52.851
No, I'm gonna ride the bull.

16:52.853 --> 16:54.453
Cable from Cable.

16:54.455 --> 16:55.587
She tracked down the participants

16:55.589 --> 16:56.655
in Windemere's research study.

16:56.657 --> 16:58.557
Took place from '98 to '99

16:58.559 --> 17:01.093
at Hudson University.

17:01.095 --> 17:03.395
Kyra, Kerry's little sister,
was part of the study.

17:03.397 --> 17:04.863
Windemere experimented on her.

17:04.865 --> 17:06.999
- So they knew each other.
- Worse.

17:07.001 --> 17:09.401
Kerry could have access to
every bit of his research,

17:09.403 --> 17:10.836
and she never mentioned it.

17:10.838 --> 17:13.505
Our client's no angel.

17:13.507 --> 17:15.240
She's a liar.

17:17.545 --> 17:19.211
To broken wings.

17:24.397 --> 17:27.131
I didn't lie. I'm not allowed
to talk about my sister

17:27.133 --> 17:28.900
and Windemere's research
project. It's all...

17:28.902 --> 17:31.269
it's all confidential.
Under a nondisclosure agreement.

17:31.271 --> 17:32.303
You were a kid.

17:32.305 --> 17:35.106
You signed a binding legal document?

17:35.108 --> 17:37.642
- Benny, easy.
- No, that man

17:37.644 --> 17:41.045
promised me he would find
a cure for my sister.

17:41.047 --> 17:43.014
And he didn't.

17:43.016 --> 17:44.382
So I-I finished the job.

17:44.384 --> 17:46.083
It'll be viewed as unethical.

17:46.085 --> 17:47.485
It's perfectly ethical.

17:47.487 --> 17:50.054
Yes, my synthetic clotting
factor's identical to his.

17:50.056 --> 17:51.756
And yes, I paired it with
a protein to replicate

17:51.758 --> 17:52.957
the plasma inside the bloodstream,

17:52.959 --> 17:54.659
preventing antibodies from rejecting it.

17:54.661 --> 17:56.494
And yes, I got that
from his research, too.

17:56.496 --> 17:58.062
But he didn't put them together.

17:58.064 --> 18:00.765
I only got about half of that,
but the part I did get

18:00.767 --> 18:04.535
is his drug's inferior. Obviousness.

18:04.537 --> 18:06.237
Thank you.

18:06.239 --> 18:07.371
Glad someone gets it.

18:07.373 --> 18:09.240
No. The legal issue at play

18:09.242 --> 18:11.876
is a term called "obviousness."

18:11.878 --> 18:14.045
Yeah, Windemere's patent
covers a combination

18:14.070 --> 18:16.388
of the clotting factor
and the delivery system.

18:16.390 --> 18:17.622
But you can override

18:17.624 --> 18:19.491
his patent if it wasn't obvious

18:19.493 --> 18:20.859
to put the same elements together

18:20.861 --> 18:22.160
in the way that you have.

18:22.162 --> 18:24.563
Obviousness.

18:25.866 --> 18:28.500
Of our jury, only Mary, Ethan and Curt

18:28.502 --> 18:30.168
have anything past high school chemistry.

18:30.170 --> 18:33.438
We'll need to make the
science easy to comprehend.

18:33.440 --> 18:34.840
All right.

18:34.842 --> 18:37.445
Benny, let's find language

18:37.470 --> 18:38.844
even an eight-year-old can understand.

18:38.846 --> 18:40.579
And start lining up experts who can

18:40.604 --> 18:43.274
use those words. Diana loves experts.

18:43.276 --> 18:45.376
She'll start with her own.

18:45.378 --> 18:47.011
Marissa,

18:47.013 --> 18:48.346
- mirror jurors?
- I...

18:48.348 --> 18:51.716
Merle, um, help me line them up.

18:54.787 --> 18:55.987
All right.

18:55.989 --> 18:57.889
Time to get to court.

18:58.791 --> 19:00.524
Hey, good morning.

19:00.526 --> 19:02.727
- Hey, how are you?
- Morning, Mr. Windemere.

19:04.264 --> 19:07.164
Barely recognize Errol
Windemere without a suit.

19:07.166 --> 19:09.634
Well, Diana did her prep.

19:09.636 --> 19:11.435
She knows not to make Windemere

19:11.437 --> 19:13.906
- look like a Yankee.
- Jeans are a nice touch.

19:13.931 --> 19:15.640
Give me your notebook.

19:15.642 --> 19:18.775
I've never seen you take notes.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.145
Wasn't asking a question.

19:26.861 --> 19:28.286
Ready to make my client an offer?

19:28.288 --> 19:30.121
How about surrender?

19:30.123 --> 19:31.789
We'd accept.

19:37.063 --> 19:38.362
Hey, hey!

19:38.364 --> 19:40.097
Bruce, Mitch, Tonya,

19:40.099 --> 19:42.241
all y'all in the back row,
what are you doing?

19:42.266 --> 19:43.881
You don't have any business in my court.

19:43.906 --> 19:45.636
Why don't you get out.

19:45.661 --> 19:48.246
Don't need any extra bodies
in here heating this room up

19:48.248 --> 19:49.815
any more than it already is.

19:49.817 --> 19:51.588
Good-bye, mirror jury.

19:51.613 --> 19:55.454
All right, then...
opening arguments.

19:55.456 --> 19:58.223
Patent infringement.

19:58.225 --> 20:02.127
Now, it sounds complicated,
but this is a simple case.

20:02.129 --> 20:03.895
If you leave your truck

20:03.897 --> 20:05.363
sitting in your front yard

20:05.365 --> 20:08.099
and someone takes it away, well,

20:08.101 --> 20:11.002
whose truck is it now?

20:11.004 --> 20:12.737
It's still yours.

20:12.739 --> 20:15.321
Even if you're not driving it.

20:15.346 --> 20:17.360
And that person is a thief.

20:17.385 --> 20:18.970
Okay, true.

20:18.972 --> 20:20.838
But if I saw your pickup

20:20.840 --> 20:23.174
and the garden hose lying next to it

20:23.176 --> 20:25.676
and I got inspired

20:25.678 --> 20:28.379
to build my own fire truck,

20:28.381 --> 20:31.515
and then drove around
town putting out fires,

20:31.517 --> 20:34.352
now what do you call me?

20:34.354 --> 20:36.554
Somebody say hero?

20:39.459 --> 20:40.791
Doctor, if you could,

20:40.793 --> 20:42.893
please describe hemophilia for us.

20:42.895 --> 20:44.562
Hemophiliacs have

20:44.564 --> 20:47.098
a lower clotting factor
level of blood plasma,

20:47.100 --> 20:48.899
or impaired activity

20:48.901 --> 20:50.901
of the coagulation factor

20:50.903 --> 20:53.738
- needed for a normal clotting process.
- So, does

20:53.740 --> 20:55.906
a hemophiliac bleed more intensely

20:55.908 --> 20:57.141
than a person without it?

20:57.143 --> 20:59.143
No, but they can bleed much longer.

20:59.145 --> 21:01.345
Even a minor injury can result in

21:01.347 --> 21:03.614
blood loss lasting days or even weeks.

21:03.616 --> 21:06.899
Okay. And Mr. Windemere's drug,

21:06.924 --> 21:09.186
recognized by United States patent number

21:09.188 --> 21:11.571
6-B 117293,

21:11.596 --> 21:15.131
dated August 11, 1999,

21:15.156 --> 21:16.989
counteracts this process.

21:16.991 --> 21:17.932
It does.

21:17.957 --> 21:20.065
His synthetic clotting factor,

21:20.090 --> 21:21.894
under certain circumstances,

21:21.896 --> 21:24.897
increases the efficacy of coagulation.

21:24.899 --> 21:26.198
Ms. Ketchum's

21:26.200 --> 21:28.346
- product utilizes the same factor?
- Yes.

21:28.371 --> 21:29.627
So they're the same.

21:29.629 --> 21:31.362
Yes.

21:32.432 --> 21:34.365
No further questions.

21:40.548 --> 21:42.740
Bull?

21:47.047 --> 21:49.414
Your Honor,

21:49.416 --> 21:52.150
I don't want to bore our
friends in the jury

21:52.152 --> 21:53.818
with any more questions for this fella.

21:53.820 --> 21:55.320
Appreciated.

21:56.823 --> 21:58.623
That's lunch.

21:58.625 --> 22:02.160
No, oxygen doesn't tell the
blood to turn scabby.

22:02.162 --> 22:04.696
There's already oxygen in blood.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.064
It's blood cells.

22:06.066 --> 22:08.132
Every cell does something.

22:08.134 --> 22:09.667
That's what those cells do.

22:09.669 --> 22:11.669
Good thing Danny's
getting us all this intel.

22:11.671 --> 22:14.172
Don't need a mirror jury if the
real jurors talk loud enough.

22:14.174 --> 22:15.952
They're not supposed to
talk about the case.

22:15.977 --> 22:17.875
Be the first jury in history to obey.

22:17.877 --> 22:18.874
Hey.

22:18.899 --> 22:20.679
Do y'all know how
blood clots are formed?

22:20.704 --> 22:22.213
When a blood vessel wall breaks,

22:22.215 --> 22:24.182
platelets change shape
from round to spiny,

22:24.184 --> 22:26.583
sticking to the broken vessel wall
and each other to plug the break.

22:26.607 --> 22:28.319
They interact with other blood proteins

22:28.321 --> 22:29.723
to form fibrin strands into a net

22:29.748 --> 22:31.856
trapping more platelets and...

22:31.858 --> 22:33.191
producing a clot.

22:33.193 --> 22:35.693
Dang, you're pretty smart.

22:35.695 --> 22:37.228
You should hear what those
folks are coming up with.

22:37.230 --> 22:40.365
Good. Their expert failed to teach them.

22:40.367 --> 22:41.933
This presents us the opportunity

22:41.935 --> 22:43.568
to define the terms.

22:43.570 --> 22:46.141
- I'd call that a win.
- A small one.

22:46.166 --> 22:48.373
A big one would be if we can
use the whole crooked system

22:48.375 --> 22:49.741
against itself.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.008
How do you do that?

22:51.010 --> 22:53.044
That's what we got to figure out.

22:53.726 --> 22:55.770
Mr. Windemere, in the time

22:55.795 --> 22:57.695
since you were granted this patent,

22:57.697 --> 23:00.464
you've distributed only one
version of a hemophilia drug,

23:00.466 --> 23:03.234
- is that right?
- Research and development is

23:03.236 --> 23:05.803
a complicated and expensive process.

23:05.805 --> 23:09.188
When we make a choice, as a company,

23:09.213 --> 23:10.608
what matter is

23:10.610 --> 23:13.010
what does the most good
for the most people.

23:13.012 --> 23:14.378
Your, your suit,

23:14.380 --> 23:17.148
claims that you patented all the elements

23:17.150 --> 23:19.216
contained in Ms. Ketchum's product.

23:19.218 --> 23:20.551
Is-is that right?

23:20.553 --> 23:21.852
Yes, I did.

23:21.854 --> 23:23.521
You had all the pieces,

23:23.523 --> 23:25.656
but you haven't put them
together this way yet?

23:25.658 --> 23:27.625
That's a simplified way of
expressing it, but yes.

23:27.627 --> 23:31.095
Like you had a-a-a toaster and a clock,

23:31.097 --> 23:32.429
and hadn't squished 'em into one.

23:32.431 --> 23:33.631
Sure. If that helps you.

23:33.633 --> 23:36.033
Well, yeah. It-it kind of does.

23:37.036 --> 23:40.070
Cause I'm holding here, the patent

23:40.072 --> 23:41.906
for the first pop-up toaster.

23:41.908 --> 23:46.810
And it's not from the inventor
of the toaster or the clock.

23:46.812 --> 23:49.678
Did you want to contest that one, too?

23:49.703 --> 23:51.715
Objection. Argumentative.

23:51.717 --> 23:52.850
Sustained.

23:52.852 --> 23:54.018
I'm sorry, but...

23:54.020 --> 23:57.154
If you could make what she made,

23:57.156 --> 23:58.822
was there any reason to sit on it,

23:58.824 --> 24:00.858
presuming that-that your story is true,

24:00.860 --> 24:03.227
that-that research and
development made it

24:03.229 --> 24:05.129
not cost effective, I mean...

24:05.131 --> 24:07.911
You're saying it's about the money,

24:08.759 --> 24:10.830
while people are literally dying?

24:10.864 --> 24:11.855
Your Honor.

24:11.880 --> 24:12.703
I'm sor...

24:12.705 --> 24:15.773
I'll leave it at that.

24:24.917 --> 24:26.951
Got Danny's report from afternoon break.

24:26.953 --> 24:28.886
We are making some inroads.

24:28.888 --> 24:30.921
We shored up Carlos and Franny.

24:30.923 --> 24:33.023
Plus Len and Lisa liked
what Merle had to say

24:33.025 --> 24:34.191
about the toaster.

24:34.193 --> 24:36.827
Well, like you said,
the science is lost on all,

24:36.829 --> 24:40.497
save Mary, Ethan and Curt,
who are against us.

24:40.499 --> 24:42.566
And that's not all
the great intel Danny got us.

24:42.568 --> 24:44.201
We also know that Diana's halo

24:44.203 --> 24:46.370
is still shining brightly on Windemere.

24:46.372 --> 24:49.940
And the mind's of Kelly-Anne,
Doug, Debbie and Jerry.

24:49.942 --> 24:52.276
Sorry, but they prefer her over Merle.

24:52.278 --> 24:54.157
They don't see her as the enemy.

24:54.182 --> 24:56.614
Maybe we should stop
seeing her that way, too.

24:57.583 --> 25:00.517
Cable, monitor the weather
systems, will you?

25:00.519 --> 25:03.120
I'm on it, but I can't
predict the weather, Bull.

25:03.122 --> 25:08.158
And I found this.

25:08.160 --> 25:09.293
It's a good look.

25:09.295 --> 25:10.628
You look really good.

25:10.630 --> 25:12.596
I-I think we're losing our connection.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.365
Hey, don't you dare...

25:16.569 --> 25:19.470
That was nice.

25:19.472 --> 25:21.372
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

25:21.374 --> 25:23.407
Yeah, on special teams, you got to do

25:23.409 --> 25:25.509
whatever you can do to stay on the team.

25:25.511 --> 25:27.044
Hey.

25:27.046 --> 25:28.946
Is that shirt tailored?

25:28.948 --> 25:31.849
Yeah, Chunk's suggestion.

25:31.851 --> 25:33.217
The bulky uniform

25:33.219 --> 25:35.152
wasn't properly showcasing the guns.

25:36.455 --> 25:38.522
You look good.

25:43.162 --> 25:44.995
Put away our weapons?

25:45.865 --> 25:48.132
Put something away.

25:58.444 --> 26:01.345
Bull was a hired gun,
but he was damn good.

26:01.347 --> 26:02.780
All right, my client was corporate.

26:02.782 --> 26:04.515
His client was corporate.

26:04.517 --> 26:05.683
But he climbed into the mind

26:05.685 --> 26:08.452
of every single one of those jurors.

26:08.454 --> 26:12.556
They went to deliberate
on a Friday night.

26:12.558 --> 26:14.291
I had 'em.

26:14.293 --> 26:15.759
But you lost.

26:15.761 --> 26:18.128
Well, Monday morning
was a different story.

26:18.130 --> 26:19.730
What happened over the weekend?

26:19.732 --> 26:21.165
I couldn't say.

26:21.167 --> 26:23.534
And I won't.

26:25.571 --> 26:27.438
Hey, Merle! Line 'em up!

26:27.440 --> 26:28.405
Passing the bar.

26:28.407 --> 26:30.469
Hey, I would never pass a bar.

26:31.410 --> 26:34.378
You ought to know,
shots are Merle's Achilles' heel.

26:37.450 --> 26:38.682
What did happen that weekend?

26:38.684 --> 26:40.217
Yeah, what did happen that weekend?

26:40.219 --> 26:43.454
'Cause I was thinking,
and if I've got it right,

26:43.456 --> 26:45.477
you started dating my sister

26:45.502 --> 26:47.291
soon after this case.

26:47.293 --> 26:50.094
This is a good time to get refills.

26:50.096 --> 26:52.096
Come on.

27:01.006 --> 27:03.974
So what about you?

27:03.976 --> 27:07.411
You want to go for a walk?

27:07.413 --> 27:10.614
Maybe I'll tell you some secrets.

27:10.616 --> 27:13.751
I feel deprived of this in the city.

27:13.753 --> 27:15.519
Light pollution...

27:15.521 --> 27:17.551
it's a terrible plague.

27:17.576 --> 27:20.224
Well, I'm sure it has its trade-offs.

27:20.226 --> 27:23.293
You've seen all that passes
for nightlife around here.

27:26.499 --> 27:29.666
Why, Ms. Diana, are you trying
to take advantage of me?

27:29.668 --> 27:31.235
The great Dr. Bull?

27:31.237 --> 27:33.036
Now, I didn't think that was possible.

27:37.977 --> 27:40.811
Last time I was here, I learned a lot.

27:40.813 --> 27:42.579
It changed me.

27:42.581 --> 27:45.883
Not too much.

27:45.885 --> 27:49.686
I thought I could win
any case in any court.

27:49.688 --> 27:52.589
Well, not all cases are
decided in a courtroom.

27:56.929 --> 27:59.963
After that Friday night,

27:59.965 --> 28:02.517
you didn't leave my sight
until Sunday morning.

28:02.542 --> 28:03.933
Yeah.

28:03.957 --> 28:06.270
You wanted to watch football.

28:06.272 --> 28:09.106
You wanted to go to church.

28:09.108 --> 28:10.641
Monday morning,

28:10.643 --> 28:12.676
the whole jury was back on your side.

28:14.046 --> 28:17.114
The whole jury was in those pews.

28:17.116 --> 28:19.883
If I had said anything to them,

28:19.885 --> 28:22.853
that would be tampering.

28:22.855 --> 28:25.522
You didn't have to.

28:25.524 --> 28:27.124
You sang,

28:27.126 --> 28:29.226
didn't you?

28:29.228 --> 28:31.795
That was supposed to be my secret weapon.

28:31.797 --> 28:34.932
I have a secret weapon too.

28:34.934 --> 28:37.434
It's not that big of a secret.

28:37.436 --> 28:40.404
Clearly, Diana knew
Merle had a weakness for tequila,

28:40.406 --> 28:43.240
but there's nothing obvious
about cellular chemistry.

28:43.242 --> 28:45.108
The jury will glaze over

28:45.110 --> 28:47.377
and assume that Windemere
knows his business.

28:47.379 --> 28:51.380
Unless I find the words to explain
science to an eight-year-old.

28:51.405 --> 28:52.983
Yeah, I think Bull is losing his mind.

28:52.985 --> 28:54.418
He may be losing his mind,

28:54.420 --> 28:56.620
or it may just be Callisto.

28:56.622 --> 28:58.388
Did you leave the barn open?

28:58.390 --> 28:59.723
No.

29:03.896 --> 29:06.396
My laptop's missing.

29:06.398 --> 29:08.532
The boxes... our research.

29:08.534 --> 29:10.868
Lindsay and Partners took everything.

29:10.870 --> 29:12.069
I'll call Bull.

29:12.071 --> 29:13.637
They put a move on us.

29:13.639 --> 29:16.707
No way that she put one on him, too.

29:16.709 --> 29:18.449
No answer.

30:04.338 --> 30:06.078
I'm not exactly filled with confidence

30:06.103 --> 30:08.007
that you have thousands
of lives in your hands.

30:08.009 --> 30:10.142
Not to mention my own
professional future.

30:10.144 --> 30:11.610
That's understandable.

30:11.612 --> 30:13.712
But I am in full command.

30:13.714 --> 30:16.105
Getting this sloppy was intentional.

30:16.130 --> 30:17.683
Wait. It was?

30:17.685 --> 30:18.988
Yeah.

30:19.013 --> 30:20.582
Okay, it was.

30:20.607 --> 30:23.690
But the other side stole all of
our research and your notebook.

30:23.715 --> 30:26.546
I never intended to call
some parade of experts.

30:26.548 --> 30:28.181
So you wanted this to happen.

30:28.183 --> 30:29.749
Everything I wrote in that note pad

30:29.751 --> 30:32.432
was to make you look like
the Angel of Sacred Heart.

30:32.457 --> 30:34.621
You're not gonna do that?

30:36.345 --> 30:37.678
No experts. Just you.

30:38.847 --> 30:41.882
Diana's been prepping for
experts all night long.

30:41.884 --> 30:43.050
Well, half the night.

30:43.052 --> 30:45.752
Wow.

30:45.754 --> 30:47.120
This strudel is fantastic.

30:47.122 --> 30:50.524
May I have another one, waitress?

30:50.526 --> 30:53.860
Please?

30:56.623 --> 30:58.190
Look what I got.

31:01.379 --> 31:03.151
Okay, so you've got pants.

31:03.176 --> 31:04.682
What's the rest of your strategy?

31:04.707 --> 31:05.895
Part one...

31:05.920 --> 31:08.380
I'm gonna show your deep
frustration with Windemere.

31:08.382 --> 31:10.615
And we show how much you love your sister

31:10.617 --> 31:11.850
and how those two things

31:11.852 --> 31:13.752
helped you accomplish
something he never could.

31:13.754 --> 31:16.568
Part two... you may
recall Windemere stated

31:16.593 --> 31:19.499
that he didn't change the drug
for 17 years because of cost.

31:19.501 --> 31:22.769
Four of our jurors sided
with you because they saw him

31:22.771 --> 31:25.860
as more interested in financial
gain than saving lives.

31:25.885 --> 31:28.942
But to reach the rest of the jury,

31:28.944 --> 31:32.392
you need to beat him with your science.

31:32.417 --> 31:33.523
How?

31:33.548 --> 31:35.548
Nerd up.

31:35.550 --> 31:38.785
Well, what about explaining the science?

31:38.787 --> 31:40.320
Benny's working on it.

31:40.322 --> 31:43.756
Whoa! What is in this thing?!

31:43.758 --> 31:46.259
Eggs, flour, water, apples and sugar.

31:46.261 --> 31:47.961
No. I mean, what is

31:47.963 --> 31:49.529
the magic recipe?

31:49.531 --> 31:51.898
'Cause however it's put together...

31:51.900 --> 31:53.746
It is the perfect hangover cure.

31:56.837 --> 31:59.370
I'm gonna take this to go.

32:01.050 --> 32:02.191
Marissa, with me.

32:02.216 --> 32:04.254
Waitress, strudel for everywhere?

32:04.279 --> 32:05.578
Well, all right.

32:05.580 --> 32:07.480
It was a big night.

32:07.482 --> 32:09.849
So the people were hungry,

32:09.851 --> 32:12.018
and this is all they had.

32:12.020 --> 32:15.855
So the guy took an apple

32:15.857 --> 32:19.592
and the water, and he made
apple juice, which was okay.

32:19.594 --> 32:22.795
But the people were still hungry.

32:22.797 --> 32:27.700
So she took all of these
ingredients and made this.

32:32.474 --> 32:35.141
And the people were full.

32:35.143 --> 32:38.311
So it's not just about
making a good strudel.

32:38.313 --> 32:39.445
What you're saying is

32:39.447 --> 32:40.980
he wanted to save money,

32:40.982 --> 32:42.682
but she wanted to save lives.

32:42.684 --> 32:44.984
I think they got it.

32:46.421 --> 32:49.589
Nice pants.

32:49.591 --> 32:52.925
So, it's a grandísimo kind of morning?

32:52.927 --> 32:55.161
Don't you worry. I'm gonna
rip your little cavalcade

32:55.163 --> 32:57.196
of so-called experts to pieces.

32:57.198 --> 32:58.865
Where are they?

33:00.869 --> 33:03.336
We only have one.

33:07.208 --> 33:09.742
Ms. Ketchum, is it true that
your sister was a participant

33:09.744 --> 33:12.078
in Mr. Windemere's research study?

33:12.080 --> 33:14.480
Yes, and I followed his
career since I was a kid.

33:14.482 --> 33:16.916
He inspired me to create this cure.

33:16.918 --> 33:18.718
How did he inspire you?

33:18.720 --> 33:20.019
By failing.

33:20.021 --> 33:21.788
My sister tried his drug.

33:21.790 --> 33:25.058
Hell, he used her blood,
my own sister's blood, to experiment.

33:25.060 --> 33:27.927
And you were a witness to this?

33:27.929 --> 33:30.997
You know how scary it is,
watching your baby sister,

33:30.999 --> 33:32.999
four years old, giving blood,

33:33.001 --> 33:34.667
when she's a hemophiliac?

33:34.669 --> 33:38.004
His drug worked for a little while, but...

33:38.006 --> 33:39.972
then her body got used to it

33:39.974 --> 33:42.075
and it wouldn't work anymore.

33:43.311 --> 33:46.245
It took me years, but I figured
out how to make it keep working.

33:46.247 --> 33:48.081
Using the same ingredients?

33:48.083 --> 33:50.483
There's a million ways to combine flour,

33:50.485 --> 33:52.618
water, eggs, apples and sugar.

33:52.620 --> 33:55.455
But only one method works
like the strudel at the diner.

33:55.457 --> 33:56.756
So you're saying

33:56.758 --> 34:00.026
that you're a better cook
than Errol Windemere?

34:00.028 --> 34:01.461
I'm a scientist.

34:01.463 --> 34:02.929
Unlike Mr. Windemere,

34:02.931 --> 34:04.764
I don't consider cost

34:04.766 --> 34:06.499
when I'm trying to save a life.

34:06.501 --> 34:08.701
No further questions.

34:11.406 --> 34:13.172
How did you do it?

34:16.077 --> 34:19.112
- I don't understand the question.
- Well,

34:19.114 --> 34:20.580
you claim to be an expert.

34:20.581 --> 34:22.949
A better scientist than Mr. Windemere.

34:22.951 --> 34:25.083
So you should be able
to explain the process.

34:25.085 --> 34:26.052
How'd you do it?

34:26.054 --> 34:27.719
No.

34:27.722 --> 34:29.589
I'm not telling you.

34:29.591 --> 34:31.286
He knows the recipe,
and he still can't make it work.

34:31.311 --> 34:33.226
I'm not gonna let you
sucker me into giving away

34:33.228 --> 34:35.194
my trade secrets.

34:35.196 --> 34:37.295
You're-you're here saying you're entitled

34:37.297 --> 34:38.844
to 20 years to figure it out.

34:38.869 --> 34:40.065
That's 20 years of people dying,

34:40.068 --> 34:41.701
while also claiming it's obvious.

34:41.703 --> 34:44.103
- Obviously, it's not obvious.
- You have no right!

34:44.105 --> 34:45.737
- You have no brains!
- You stole

34:45.739 --> 34:47.607
- my work!
- You gave up on my sister!

34:47.609 --> 34:50.076
All right, all right, all right.

34:50.612 --> 34:52.311
Let's take a recess.

34:52.313 --> 34:53.746
Everybody cool off.

34:56.717 --> 34:58.584
So, Kelly-Anne and Doug apparently saw

34:58.586 --> 35:00.319
Diana toss a look to the judge.

35:00.321 --> 35:01.554
Thought it was cheating.

35:01.556 --> 35:03.256
That makes it six to six.

35:03.258 --> 35:05.291
But, Debbie, Curt, and Lisa

35:05.293 --> 35:07.426
all wanted to hear the
rest of the argument.

35:07.428 --> 35:08.628
They won't be moved without it.

35:08.630 --> 35:10.663
So we're winning on merits,

35:10.665 --> 35:12.064
but we're still losing.

35:12.066 --> 35:13.666
All the holdouts want to know

35:13.668 --> 35:15.501
if Kerry's right about Windemere's science.

35:15.503 --> 35:17.470
Do we put him back on the stand?

35:17.472 --> 35:19.236
Yeah, we could,

35:19.261 --> 35:21.807
but we don't know if he's right or wrong.

35:21.809 --> 35:24.544
Without drowning the jury
in those technical terms,

35:24.546 --> 35:27.313
there's only one person
who can actually speak

35:27.315 --> 35:29.782
- his language.
- Jury needs to hear Kerry sing.

35:29.784 --> 35:32.218
Judge isn't gonna let her rip
into Windemere again though.

35:32.220 --> 35:34.854
And Diana's not gonna let
him fall for it again.

35:34.856 --> 35:37.493
These are good people.
They just need to be convinced.

35:37.518 --> 35:38.495
I just don't know how

35:38.519 --> 35:40.693
we get any more points on
the board in that courtroom.

35:40.695 --> 35:42.662
Maybe we can't.

35:42.664 --> 35:45.064
But we can still win.

35:52.734 --> 35:56.302
I'm having fewer regrets about
not making the trip down.

35:56.304 --> 35:58.905
It's tough to see you like this.

35:58.907 --> 36:01.074
I prefer this.

36:01.076 --> 36:02.709
Yeah.

36:03.812 --> 36:05.678
Well, it's time to play
the ace in the hole.

36:05.680 --> 36:08.014
Yeah? What's that?

36:08.016 --> 36:09.849
You.

36:09.851 --> 36:11.284
Pretty sure most of it's legal.

36:11.286 --> 36:16.222
But, then again, I'm not a lawyer.

36:16.224 --> 36:18.424
Thank you, Chunk.

36:20.562 --> 36:22.962
Well, where's the rest of your crew?

36:22.964 --> 36:25.298
Packing up. Long trip home.

36:25.300 --> 36:26.666
Don't tell me you're conceding defeat.

36:26.668 --> 36:27.734
You could still win.

36:27.736 --> 36:31.204
It'd take a miracle.

36:33.141 --> 36:35.708
When you get the chance...
And you will get the chance...

36:35.710 --> 36:38.211
You know what to do.

36:40.048 --> 36:42.215
The Honorable Judge Albert Darling.

36:42.217 --> 36:43.683
All right.

36:43.685 --> 36:45.351
Let's close this thing up.

36:49.524 --> 36:51.291
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

36:51.293 --> 36:53.159
this case is pretty simple.

36:53.161 --> 36:55.428
Errol Windemere owns a 20-year pa...

36:57.098 --> 36:58.531
I'm sorry.

36:58.533 --> 37:02.201
And it's only been 17 years.

37:03.638 --> 37:06.272
Shoot,
there's a storm coming in.

37:06.274 --> 37:08.241
Wrap it up, Counselor.

37:08.243 --> 37:10.143
You know me.

37:10.145 --> 37:11.477
I know Errol Windemere.

37:11.479 --> 37:13.813
I vouch for him.

37:13.815 --> 37:15.648
Merle.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.083
Merle.

37:19.054 --> 37:21.154
Well, Your Honor...

37:24.659 --> 37:26.926
Okay. Put a pin in this.

37:26.928 --> 37:28.261
Let's go.

37:28.263 --> 37:31.931
Jury, everybody,
let's get down to the shelter.

37:43.345 --> 37:45.611
Don't be shy. Come on in.

37:46.848 --> 37:49.615
Plaintiff

37:49.617 --> 37:50.850
and Defendant,

37:50.852 --> 37:53.119
in here.

38:08.403 --> 38:12.438
Go get inside, you dummy.
There's a tornado coming.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.540
Is there?

38:14.542 --> 38:16.753
Yeah. I mean, it's lit up
all over social media.

38:16.778 --> 38:18.378
Look, they're tweeting
about it a town over.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.146
Once again, there's a severe

38:20.148 --> 38:22.548
tornado warning issued for all of Callisto.

38:22.550 --> 38:23.750
While everyone in Callisto

38:23.752 --> 38:25.485
should immediately find shelter,

38:25.487 --> 38:28.654
a tornado watch has been issued
for neighboring counties.

38:28.656 --> 38:31.557
I feel for you, folks.

38:37.899 --> 38:39.899
You don't know how to do what I did.

38:39.901 --> 38:42.468
Your patent comes up short,
and I'll bet my sister's life

38:42.470 --> 38:44.670
this jury will see that.

38:44.672 --> 38:47.640
How is Kyra?

38:47.642 --> 38:49.509
What happened?

38:49.511 --> 38:51.477
I really do care about her, you know.

38:51.479 --> 38:53.246
She was pulling a shirt over her head

38:53.248 --> 38:55.515
and walked through a
plate glass sliding door.

38:55.517 --> 38:57.016
She thought it was open.

38:57.018 --> 38:58.418
12 stitches. She thinks

38:58.420 --> 39:01.154
it's gonna be a cool scar.

39:01.156 --> 39:03.089
I wish I could have made it last forever,

39:03.091 --> 39:05.091
instead of just temporarily.

39:05.960 --> 39:08.628
You were close.

39:08.630 --> 39:11.831
Started with your individualized
protein methodology.

39:11.833 --> 39:13.766
Had to bond it with factor VIII.

39:13.768 --> 39:16.669
How? Did you separate the
platelets from the plasma?

39:16.671 --> 39:19.639
Well, first, I produced
platelet-rich plasma

39:19.641 --> 39:21.374
through differential centrifugation,

39:21.376 --> 39:22.942
adjusting the acceleration force

39:22.944 --> 39:24.677
to sediment the cellular constituents.

39:24.679 --> 39:26.546
But a second centrifugation

39:26.548 --> 39:27.613
concentrates the platelets

39:27.615 --> 39:29.482
in the smallest final plasma volume,

39:29.484 --> 39:30.667
leaving the platelets...

39:30.692 --> 39:32.885
The platelets in
near-to-perfect isolation.

39:32.887 --> 39:34.821
- Yes.
- That's the step you missed.

39:34.823 --> 39:37.327
That's what kept my sister alive.

39:37.401 --> 39:39.067
With all the time
and money in the world,

39:39.069 --> 39:40.635
I wouldn't have figured that out.

39:40.637 --> 39:44.206
Very impressive. Nice work.

39:44.208 --> 39:45.674
I can move for a mistrial.

39:45.676 --> 39:48.643
I doubt the court will
spend another week on this.

39:49.446 --> 39:50.805
All right, everyone,

39:50.830 --> 39:52.914
seemed like another false alarm.
Let's get back to it.

39:52.916 --> 39:55.183
Merle, you're up.

39:55.185 --> 39:57.919
I want to drop the suit.

39:57.921 --> 40:00.922
- You're sure?
- Yes.

40:03.929 --> 40:06.129
Your Honor, my client would
like to withdraw the suit.

40:08.684 --> 40:10.000
Are you kidding me, Counselor?

40:10.002 --> 40:11.401
No, Your Honor. He's changed his position

40:11.403 --> 40:12.436
regarding the patent.

40:12.438 --> 40:15.138
Okay. Apologies to the jury.

40:15.140 --> 40:18.041
Wasn't a complete waste of time.
You each made ten dollars a day.

40:18.066 --> 40:20.110
We are adjourned.

40:20.112 --> 40:21.411
Jerry, go fishing.

40:26.618 --> 40:27.818
That's it?

40:27.820 --> 40:29.843
He's not gonna stop me
from making my drug?

40:29.868 --> 40:31.521
It's over. You won.

40:32.324 --> 40:34.658
Congratulations.

40:34.660 --> 40:36.660
Merle,

40:36.662 --> 40:38.929
Bender, Lindsay & Partners

40:38.931 --> 40:41.531
may have the plaintiff's
side all shored up,

40:41.533 --> 40:45.070
but there's a lot of defendants out
there who could use your services.

40:45.095 --> 40:48.038
You know, that's not a bad idea, JB.

40:48.040 --> 40:49.940
Congratulations.

40:55.748 --> 40:57.681
Well, you may not be able to sing

40:57.683 --> 41:00.350
but... sure can make it rain.

41:04.155 --> 41:05.857
Pair of pants come with this?

41:08.961 --> 41:12.295
Callisto.

41:16.869 --> 41:18.869
Let me get this straight.

41:18.871 --> 41:21.071
You're mad because you couldn't
get the jury to officially

41:21.073 --> 41:23.673
- find in our favor?
- Let me clarify,

41:23.675 --> 41:26.676
I'm not mad. I'm merely disappointed.

41:26.678 --> 41:28.979
- And there's a difference.
- Let's be honest, the reason

41:28.981 --> 41:30.881
you're not satisfied is because

41:30.883 --> 41:33.150
Diana didn't call it a win.

41:33.152 --> 41:35.018
- Ooh...
- Ooh...

41:35.020 --> 41:37.053
All right, it's a win.

41:37.055 --> 41:38.188
With an asterisk.

41:38.490 --> 41:40.557
After the first time you, quote,

41:40.959 --> 41:42.959
"didn't lose in Callisto,"

41:42.961 --> 41:45.874
- how'd you pull out of your tailspin?
- Wait a minute,

41:45.899 --> 41:47.998
don't tell me my sister
was your Callisto rebound.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.566
Not exactly.

41:49.568 --> 41:52.169
I went down there a lone
wolf who'd never lost a case.

41:52.171 --> 41:55.906
But I had forgotten why
I got into this business

41:55.908 --> 41:57.274
in the first place.

41:57.276 --> 41:59.042
And, no,

41:59.044 --> 42:00.577
it wasn't the money.

42:00.579 --> 42:02.454
It was people.

42:02.479 --> 42:04.781
Because you can't take on the world

42:04.783 --> 42:06.550
all alone.

42:07.252 --> 42:09.520
And so I sought people I could trust.

42:09.922 --> 42:11.288
People like your sister.

42:11.290 --> 42:13.256
And you guys.

42:13.281 --> 42:14.224
This team.

42:14.226 --> 42:16.393
And clients

42:16.395 --> 42:18.728
I could believe in.

42:18.730 --> 42:22.332
That's what I learned.

42:26.572 --> 42:30.240
I thought you lost in Callisto
'cause of this.

42:31.677 --> 42:34.110
Hello!

42:34.112 --> 42:34.878
Wow.
