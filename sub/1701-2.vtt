WEBVTT

00:08.132 --> 00:11.093
Okay, these were expensive,
and he's gonna grow out of them...

00:11.261 --> 00:13.971
...in 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist!

00:14.139 --> 00:15.973
Aww!

00:17.809 --> 00:19.935
Look at these.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.145
Hey, Ben.

00:21.312 --> 00:23.063
"Just do it"! Unh!

00:25.066 --> 00:26.775
Oh, my God! Oh!

00:26.943 --> 00:28.736
Was that too much pressure for him?

00:30.447 --> 00:34.533
- Oh, is he hungry already? Aw.
- I guess so.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.410
You know, it's...

00:39.414 --> 00:42.458
Something funny about sneakers.
I'll be right back.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.377
Oh, uh, I gotta get one too.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.965
Hey, what are you guys doing?

00:50.216 --> 00:52.676
We're just hanging out
by the spoons.

00:53.344 --> 00:54.762
Ladle?

00:54.971 --> 00:56.180
Will you guys grow up?

00:56.389 --> 00:59.183
This is the most natural,
beautiful thing in the world.

00:59.350 --> 01:02.394
Yeah, we know.
But there's a baby sucking on it.

01:04.563 --> 01:09.943
This is my son having lunch, okay?
It'll happen a lot, so get used to it.

01:10.111 --> 01:13.655
If you have a problem, if you're
uncomfortable, just ask questions.

01:13.823 --> 01:16.492
Carol's fine with it. Come on.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.621
- Carol?
- Carol.

01:22.248 --> 01:25.918
I was wondering if Joey could ask you
a question about breast-feeding?

01:28.379 --> 01:30.923
- Sure.
- Uh...

01:31.883 --> 01:33.342
Does it hurt?

01:34.594 --> 01:37.096
It did at first, but not anymore.

01:37.514 --> 01:38.555
Chandler?

01:40.141 --> 01:43.435
So, uh, how often can you do it?

01:44.062 --> 01:45.479
As much as he needs.

01:46.272 --> 01:49.566
Oh, okay, I got one, I got one. Uh...

01:51.069 --> 01:54.196
If he blows into one,
does the other one get bigger?

02:44.706 --> 02:47.624
- Rachel, do you have muffins left?
- Yeah, I forget which ones.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.835
Oh, you're busy, I'll get it.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.587
- Anyone else want one?
- No, thanks.

02:51.754 --> 02:52.963
No, I'm all set.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.132
Oh, you're losing your apron.
Let me get it.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.800
- Oh.
- There you go.

02:56.968 --> 02:58.302
Thank you.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.055
Ugh, what a bitch.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.270
Listen, guys, I have a friend
at Bloomingdale's who's quitting...

03:08.438 --> 03:10.522
...and he wants to abuse his discount.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.358
So anyone want to come
take advantage of it?

03:13.526 --> 03:16.236
I can't. I have to take
my grandmother to the vet.

03:19.616 --> 03:22.993
- Okay. Um, I'll go with you.
- Great.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.372
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, sweetums.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.084
- And hello to the rest.
- Hi.

03:33.421 --> 03:34.546
What are you doing?

03:34.714 --> 03:37.090
You can't go shopping with her.
What about Rachel?

03:37.967 --> 03:40.052
- It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
- Come on.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.137
You're going to
Bloomingdale's with Julie.

03:42.305 --> 03:45.307
It's like cheating on Rachel
in her house of worship.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.435
- But I...
- Monica, she will kill you.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.773
She will kill you
like a dog in the street!

03:57.320 --> 04:00.948
So, uh, Jules tells me you guys
are going shopping tomorrow.

04:01.115 --> 04:04.451
Yeah, um, it's actually not that big a deal.
In fact...

04:04.619 --> 04:08.747
It's a big deal to me. This is great.
I really appreciate this.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.499
You're welcome.

04:25.306 --> 04:31.228
Bijan for men?

04:32.939 --> 04:34.690
- Hey, Annabel.
- Hey, Joey.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.109
- Did you hear about the new guy?
- Who?

04:37.277 --> 04:41.613
Nobody knows his name. Me and
the girls call him "The Hombre Man."

04:51.124 --> 04:52.541
Hombre?

04:57.338 --> 04:59.673
What's he doing in my section?

04:59.882 --> 05:01.591
I guess he doesn't know.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.385
Well, he's gonna.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.555
I'll see you a little later, okay?

05:09.767 --> 05:11.351
Hey, how you doing?

05:11.894 --> 05:13.603
Morning.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.814
Listen, uh, heh. I know you're new...

05:15.982 --> 05:19.151
...but, uh, it's kind of
understood that everything...

05:19.319 --> 05:22.821
...from young men's to
the escalator is, uh, my territory.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.575
- Your territory, huh?
- Yeah.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.661
- Bijan for men?
- No, thanks.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.330
Hombre?

05:31.497 --> 05:33.665
Yeah, all right.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.506
You were saying?

05:45.511 --> 05:49.556
Phoebe, listen. You were with me,
and we were shopping all day.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.100
- What?
- We were shopping and we had lunch.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.144
All right. What did I have?

05:54.312 --> 05:57.439
- You had a salad.
- No wonder I don't feel full.

05:58.649 --> 05:59.900
Hi, guys. What's up?

06:00.068 --> 06:02.986
I went shopping with Monica all day
and I had a salad.

06:05.239 --> 06:07.574
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?

06:07.742 --> 06:08.825
Um...

06:08.993 --> 06:11.411
We went shopping for, um...

06:11.913 --> 06:13.038
For, um...

06:13.373 --> 06:15.207
For fur.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.837
- You went shopping for fur?
- Yeah.

06:21.422 --> 06:25.300
And then I realized
that I'm against that and, um...

06:25.468 --> 06:27.719
So then we bought some, um...

06:29.138 --> 06:30.222
Um, boobs.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.146
You bought boobs?

06:40.233 --> 06:41.858
Bras!

06:42.693 --> 06:43.819
We bought bras!

06:44.779 --> 06:47.030
We bought bras.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.620
Bijan for men?

06:53.788 --> 06:55.580
Bijan for...

06:57.125 --> 06:58.417
Hey, Annabel. Uh...

06:58.584 --> 07:02.671
Listen, I was wondering if after work
we could grab a cup of coffee?

07:02.839 --> 07:05.257
Actually, I sort of have plans.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.633
Oh.

07:10.471 --> 07:12.097
You ready, Annabel?

07:13.391 --> 07:14.850
You bet.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.187
- Maybe some other time.
- Yeah.

07:28.573 --> 07:32.701
It's not the first time I lost a girl
to a cowboy spraying cologne.

07:32.910 --> 07:34.411
Bijan for men?

07:34.871 --> 07:36.496
Bijan for men!

07:38.040 --> 07:39.958
Okay, and this is Funny Clown.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.753
Funny Clown is only for after his naps,
not before or he won't sleep.

07:43.921 --> 07:47.382
We've been through this before.
We have a good time.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.844
We laugh, we play.
It's like we're father and son.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.765
Honey, relax.
Ross is great with him.

07:55.933 --> 07:59.853
Don't look so surprised.
I'm a lovely person.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.732
Oh, this is so cute.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.525
Ah, I got that for him!

08:05.693 --> 08:07.360
"My Mommies Love Me."

08:10.990 --> 08:12.407
That's clever.

08:14.118 --> 08:15.243
Hello?

08:15.411 --> 08:17.120
Oh, hi, Jul...

08:18.456 --> 08:19.998
Hi, Jew!

08:21.667 --> 08:23.335
Uh-huh.

08:23.544 --> 08:26.213
Uh-huh. Okay, um, sure.

08:26.380 --> 08:29.382
That'd be great. See you then. Bye.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.801
Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"?

08:35.347 --> 08:38.265
Yes. Um, yes, I did.

08:38.433 --> 08:40.644
That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.692
Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.325
Ben, dinner!

08:56.285 --> 08:57.661
Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.

08:57.912 --> 09:01.456
You didn't microwave that, did you?
It's breast milk, you're not supposed to.

09:01.624 --> 09:04.501
Duh, I think I know
how to heat breast milk. Heh.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.462
Okay.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.465
What did you just do?

09:10.633 --> 09:12.425
I licked my arm, what?

09:12.593 --> 09:14.928
It's breast milk!

09:15.096 --> 09:16.346
So?

09:16.514 --> 09:20.600
Phoebe, that is juice
squeezed from a person.

09:21.435 --> 09:24.229
- What is the big deal?
- No, no...

09:25.815 --> 09:27.440
What did you just do?

09:29.485 --> 09:32.904
Can people stop
drinking the breast milk?

09:34.407 --> 09:37.325
- You won't even taste it?
- No.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.703
Not even if you just
pretend it's milk?

09:39.870 --> 09:43.206
Not even if Carol's breast had
a picture of a missing child on it.

09:50.840 --> 09:51.881
- Hey.
- Hi.

09:52.049 --> 09:54.384
- Where is everybody?
- Took Ben to the park.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.928
- Where have you been?
- Just out.

09:57.096 --> 10:01.391
Had some lunch. Just me.
A little quality time with me.

10:02.018 --> 10:05.145
- Hey, thanks for your jacket.
- Oh, no problem.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.564
- You can borrow it, by the way.
- Heh.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.234
- Oh, here are your keys, honey.
- Thank you.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.487
- Mon?
- Mm-hmm?

10:14.655 --> 10:18.491
If, uh, you were at lunch alone,
how come it cost you $53?

10:21.829 --> 10:24.080
You know what probably happened?

10:24.248 --> 10:27.167
- Someone must have stolen my credit card.
- Ah.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.337
And put the receipt
back in your pocket?

10:30.504 --> 10:34.799
Huh. That is an excellent,
excellent question.

10:35.217 --> 10:36.676
That is excellent.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.889
What's with you?
Who did you have lunch with?

10:41.098 --> 10:42.474
- Judy.
- Who?

10:42.642 --> 10:45.143
- Julie. Jody?
- What?

10:46.812 --> 10:50.523
- You were with Julie?
- Mm. Look.

10:50.691 --> 10:53.318
When it started,
I was just trying to be nice to her...

10:53.486 --> 10:56.363
...because she was
my brother's girlfriend.

10:56.530 --> 10:59.741
And then one thing led to another...

10:59.909 --> 11:02.786
...and before I knew it, we were...

11:03.245 --> 11:05.330
...shopping.
- Aah.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.336
Oh, my God.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.714
Wait, we only did it once.

11:16.717 --> 11:18.510
It didn't mean anything to me.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.805
- Yeah, right. Sure.
- Really!

11:21.972 --> 11:24.849
Rachel,
I was thinking of you the whole time.

11:27.853 --> 11:32.107
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
I never meant for you to find out.

11:32.274 --> 11:35.985
Oh, please! Please!
You wanted to get caught!

11:36.445 --> 11:37.696
That is not true!

11:37.905 --> 11:40.323
So you just happened
to leave it in here?

11:41.409 --> 11:45.120
Did it ever occur to you
that I might just be that stupid?

11:47.039 --> 11:49.332
Okay, Monica,
I just have to know one thing.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.171
Did you go with her
to Bloomingdale's?

12:05.099 --> 12:07.976
Okay. Okay.

12:09.186 --> 12:13.231
Okay, I just really, um...
I just need to not be with you right now.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.117
Hi, who's this?

12:24.285 --> 12:27.454
Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?
It's Monica.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.832
Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.918
Joanne, it's not as simple
as all that, okay?

12:35.379 --> 12:38.840
No, I don't care what Steve thinks.
Hi, Steve.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.179
- Hey!
- Hi!

12:44.722 --> 12:45.930
How did we do?

12:46.098 --> 12:48.808
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk
and Ross freaked out.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.852
I... I did not freak out.

12:51.020 --> 12:54.147
- Why'd you freak out?
- Because it's breast milk.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.941
It's gross!

12:57.109 --> 12:58.651
My breast milk is gross?

13:00.529 --> 13:02.489
This should be fun.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.367
No, Carol.
There's nothing wrong with it.

13:06.535 --> 13:10.163
I just don't think
breast milk is for adults.

13:10.331 --> 13:13.708
Of course, the packaging does
appeal to grownups and kids.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.922
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it.
It's no big deal.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.549
- Come on, just taste it.
- Ha-ha-ha.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.551
That would be no.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.512
- Come on.
- Try it.

13:25.679 --> 13:28.306
- It's natural.
- It doesn't taste bad.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.392
Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet.
Sort of like, uh...

13:31.560 --> 13:33.686
- Like what?
- Cantaloupe juice.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.396
Exactly.

13:42.404 --> 13:43.988
You've tasted it.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.199
You've tasted it.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.659
Uh-huh.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.245
Oh, you've tasted it.

13:52.414 --> 13:55.375
You can keep saying it,
but it won't stop being true.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.634
Give me the bottle.

14:10.432 --> 14:11.933
Get me the towel.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.082
Howdy.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.461
Give me a box ofjuice.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.133
Well, they switched me over to Hombre.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.386
Maybe it's because of
the way you're dressed.

14:49.763 --> 14:53.516
Or maybe this guy's doing so good
they want to put more people on it.

14:54.059 --> 14:56.978
This guy goes through
two bottles a day now.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.690
What do you care?

15:01.525 --> 15:04.861
You're an actor. This is your day job.
Isn't supposed to mean anything.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.572
I know, but I was the best.

15:07.781 --> 15:10.909
You know? I liked being the best.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.332
Maybe I should get
out of the game.

15:17.499 --> 15:20.668
They need guys up in housewares
to serve cheese.

15:21.545 --> 15:22.712
Say you do that.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.966
Sooner or later, somebody will come
along that slices a better cheddar.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.595
And then where you gonna run?

15:30.763 --> 15:32.805
- I guess you're right.
- Damn right I'm right.

15:32.973 --> 15:35.516
Show this guy what you're made of.
Stand your ground.

15:35.684 --> 15:40.188
Show him that you're the baddest
Hombre west of the lingerie!

15:40.940 --> 15:42.982
- I'm gonna do it!
- All right!

15:44.026 --> 15:47.820
Now, go see Miss Kitty and
she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.699
I don't know what to say.

15:51.867 --> 15:54.202
That works good
because I'm not listening.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.788
I feel terrible. I really do.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.207
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did my back hurt your knife?

16:00.042 --> 16:01.626
Rachel!

16:02.419 --> 16:04.921
Say that I'm friends with her.
We spend time together.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.173
- Is that so terrible?
- Yes.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.926
- It's that terrible?
- Yes, Monica! You don't get it.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.803
It's bad enough she stole the guy...

16:12.054 --> 16:14.555
...who may be the person
I'm supposed to be with.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.057
But now...

16:17.434 --> 16:18.935
...she's actually...

16:19.812 --> 16:22.563
But now she's actually stealing you!

16:24.566 --> 16:25.984
Me?

16:26.151 --> 16:28.111
What are you talking about?

16:28.278 --> 16:30.738
Nobody could steal me from you.

16:30.948 --> 16:34.409
Because I'm friends with her doesn't
make me any less friends with you.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.619
Honey.

16:36.787 --> 16:39.080
I mean, you're my...

16:39.790 --> 16:41.958
And we're...

16:44.420 --> 16:47.338
- Oh, I love you!
- I love you too!

16:51.719 --> 16:55.805
You guys, um, I know that this really
doesn't have anything to do with me.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.516
But, um, I love you guys too!

17:04.440 --> 17:06.648
Ugh, I really needed that.

17:08.484 --> 17:10.528
Look, I know you're in a place
right now...

17:10.695 --> 17:13.281
...where you really need
to hate Julie's guts.

17:13.490 --> 17:16.325
But she didn't do anything wrong.

17:16.952 --> 17:20.954
She's just a girl who met a guy,
and now they go out.

17:21.623 --> 17:24.625
I think that if you gave her
a chance, you'd like her.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.796
Will you give that a chance?

17:29.673 --> 17:30.923
For me?

17:33.260 --> 17:35.386
I'd do anything for you,
you know that.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.930
I'd do anything for you!

17:39.349 --> 17:41.559
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

17:59.745 --> 18:01.287
Morning.

18:02.664 --> 18:05.875
Heh. I said, morning.

18:07.294 --> 18:08.544
I heard you.

18:10.047 --> 18:13.299
All right, everybody.
I'm opening the doors.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.759
You boys ready?

18:20.265 --> 18:21.599
Ready.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.226
Yeah, I'm ready.

19:09.898 --> 19:12.275
You idiot! You stupid cowboy!

19:12.442 --> 19:14.652
You've blinded me! I'm suing!

19:14.820 --> 19:18.531
Oh, my God! Todd!
What the hell did you do?

19:18.699 --> 19:20.533
I'm sorry. I'm such a doofus!

19:20.784 --> 19:23.077
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.080
My God, what happened?

19:26.248 --> 19:29.458
Eh, these new kids, they never last.

19:29.626 --> 19:32.003
Sooner or later they all...

19:32.629 --> 19:34.422
...stop lasting.

19:35.549 --> 19:39.177
Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you
that cup of coffee now?

19:39.553 --> 19:40.928
Sure.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.985
- So.
- So.

19:59.823 --> 20:02.241
I just thought the two of us
should hang out a bit.

20:02.409 --> 20:05.203
I mean, you know,
we've never really talked.

20:05.370 --> 20:08.623
I guess you'd know that,
being one of the two of us. Ha, ha, right?

20:08.790 --> 20:10.791
- I know.
- Mm.

20:10.959 --> 20:14.295
I probably shouldn't
even tell you this...

20:14.504 --> 20:17.632
...but I'm pretty much
totally intimidated by you.

20:18.675 --> 20:21.135
Really? Me?

20:21.303 --> 20:23.179
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

20:23.347 --> 20:25.181
Ross is so crazy about you...

20:25.349 --> 20:28.601
...and I really wanted you
to like me, and I...

20:28.769 --> 20:31.604
It's probably me just
being totally paranoid...

20:31.813 --> 20:35.316
...but I kind of got the feeling
that maybe you don't.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.783
Well...

20:44.618 --> 20:46.494
...you're not totally paranoid.

20:47.996 --> 20:50.414
- Oy.
- Um.

20:52.125 --> 20:54.627
Okay. Um...

20:55.629 --> 20:58.422
- God. Um...
- Heh.

20:59.132 --> 21:02.593
When you and, uh,
Ross first started going out...

21:02.761 --> 21:06.222
...it was really hard for me, um...

21:07.099 --> 21:12.436
...for many reasons of which I'm not
gonna bore you with now, but, um...

21:16.149 --> 21:20.653
I see how happy he is
and how good you guys are together.

21:21.863 --> 21:25.866
And, um, Monica's always
saying how nice you are...

21:26.034 --> 21:28.369
...and God, I hate it when she's right.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.290
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

21:32.457 --> 21:36.168
Listen. Would you like to go to
a movie sometime or something?

21:36.336 --> 21:39.297
- Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
- Yeah?

21:39.464 --> 21:41.966
- I'd love it too. Okay.
- Okay.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.718
- Oh, shoot, I gotta go.
- Okay.

21:43.885 --> 21:46.012
- So I'll talk to you later.
- All right, Julie.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.847
- Bye.
- Bye.

21:55.522 --> 21:57.982
What a manipulative bitch.

22:29.139 --> 22:30.806
It's not bad.
