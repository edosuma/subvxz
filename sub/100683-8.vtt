Yeah.

Get it, son.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.899
Aah!

00:36.514 --> 00:39.648
-What the blazes?
You've got to be kidding.
-I didn't say anything.

00:39.691 --> 00:42.085
-Please, just...
-Shut up. I'm not talking
to you, jogger man.

00:42.129 --> 00:43.913

00:43.956 --> 00:45.654
-: "Come On Eileen."
-Speak up.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.003
"Come On Eileen."

00:47.047 --> 00:49.484
-From when?
-1982, maybe?

00:49.527 --> 00:51.268
Like hell it was.

00:51.312 --> 00:54.358
-♪ Come on Eileen...♪-I've been robbed. I say robbed!

00:54.402 --> 00:55.881
-NANDOR:
What is the great emergency?
-Shush.

00:55.925 --> 00:58.667
Someone has stolen oneof Laszlo's songs that he wrote.

00:58.710 --> 01:01.235
-Did you really write
"Come On Eileen"?
-Yes, I did.

01:01.278 --> 01:03.454
I wrote this melody in 1852.

01:03.498 --> 01:05.500
It was called "Chum on Irene."

01:05.543 --> 01:08.372
An ode to the local
fishmonger's missus, Irene.

01:08.416 --> 01:11.245
Charming lady. My darling, willyou tell him to turn that off?

01:11.288 --> 01:12.985
-Silence this machine.

01:13.029 --> 01:15.162
I've been shit on
from a great height.

01:15.205 --> 01:17.164
-And it's not the first time.
-Tell them about

01:17.207 --> 01:18.904
-"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow."-I wrote that song.

01:18.948 --> 01:20.254
"For IAm a Jolly Good Fellow."

01:20.297 --> 01:21.603
That's what it was
originally called.

01:21.646 --> 01:24.040
I'm. Not he or she. I'm.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.043
-Hello.
-Greetings.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.523
Is Nandor at home?

01:28.566 --> 01:29.915
Maybe.
Who are you?

01:29.959 --> 01:31.917
I'm his familiar, Benjy Everett.

01:31.961 --> 01:34.355
Nandor's gonna make me
a vampire.

Wow,

02:22.229 --> 02:24.013
you haven't aged a bit.

02:24.056 --> 02:25.623
Benjy was my familiar

02:25.667 --> 02:28.887
for a time during the 1970s.

02:28.931 --> 02:31.673
He was fine,
but he was quite vocal

02:31.716 --> 02:35.024
about his desire
to become a vampire.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.852
So irritating.

02:36.895 --> 02:38.462
I couldn't take it anymore,

02:38.506 --> 02:42.074
so I hypnotized him
to forget about us here.

02:42.118 --> 02:43.337
Then I left him

02:43.380 --> 02:44.773
in a rest stop.

02:44.816 --> 02:46.470
In Delaware.

02:46.514 --> 02:47.558
Don't feel bad for me.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.995
-I don't.
-I've had an outstanding life.

02:50.039 --> 02:51.345
Got to thank my missus for that.

02:51.388 --> 02:53.434
-Paula saved me.
She found me wandering around
-Aw.

02:53.477 --> 02:56.001
at a rest stop in Delaware,

02:56.045 --> 02:58.830
high on drugs, talking ragtime.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.223
She got me cleaned up.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.225
Helped me land a job
in the insurance game.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.401
That's a fantastic industry.

03:04.445 --> 03:07.491
But how did you find your way
back here?

03:07.535 --> 03:08.884
Paula got me to try Lumosity.

03:08.927 --> 03:10.451

03:10.494 --> 03:12.017
This is a herb or elixir?

03:12.061 --> 03:15.064
-It's an app on the phone, Ma...-Shh. Let him talk.

03:15.107 --> 03:16.370

03:27.294 --> 03:28.382
BOTH :
Colin Robinson.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.035
That's when I realized--
Nandor,

03:30.079 --> 03:32.386
you son of a bitch.

03:32.429 --> 03:33.300
You were testing me.

03:34.344 --> 03:35.737
Yes.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.521
I'm ready to be a vampire.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.131
NANDOR:
Congratulations.

03:39.175 --> 03:41.351

My Laszlo has always

04:10.554 --> 04:11.468
been quite musical.

I slept in this closet

05:17.055 --> 05:18.492
ten years?

05:18.535 --> 05:20.058
That's my old pillow.

05:20.102 --> 05:23.018
God, I used to beat off
into that thing every night.

05:23.061 --> 05:25.020
-Oh, not that pillow.
-Definitely that one.

05:25.063 --> 05:26.500

05:26.543 --> 05:29.546
Hey, can I come to the familiarmixer with you tonight?

05:29.590 --> 05:32.810
-Yeah, sure.
-My last chance to kick up
my heels as a familiar

05:32.854 --> 05:35.422

05:40.905 --> 05:42.080
Thank you, Guillermo.

05:42.124 --> 05:44.300
It's a lot livelier
than I remember.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.519
What?

05:45.562 --> 05:47.564
-Freddy? Benjy Everett.
-Benjy. Ah.

05:47.608 --> 05:50.393
GUILLERMO:
I guess these mixers  started as a way for familiars

05:50.437 --> 05:53.222
to network
and exchange work techniques,

05:53.265 --> 05:54.615
but it's mostly bitching.

05:54.658 --> 05:56.530
And sad hookups.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.619
My vampire let me drive here,

05:58.662 --> 06:01.317
so if you
need a ride anywhere,

06:01.361 --> 06:04.799
-or if you just want to,
like, sit and chat or...
-Aw...

06:04.842 --> 06:07.454
-whatever...
-Is that Celeste?

06:07.497 --> 06:10.544
-I'm gonna go say hi.
-You know, you don't even
have to do anything, you know.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.328
So she was like, "Screw it,

06:12.372 --> 06:14.330
I'm just gonna
make you a vampire."

06:14.374 --> 06:17.246
-BRAD: Did it hurt?
-Yes. It did.

06:17.289 --> 06:18.247
-Hey, Celeste.
-CELESTE: It did.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.423
Hi!

06:20.467 --> 06:22.817
-Elmo!
-Guillermo.

06:22.860 --> 06:25.210
-Hello.

06:25.254 --> 06:27.430
Celeste was a familiar
that I used to help out

06:27.474 --> 06:30.302
when she had too many bodies
that she couldn't get rid of.

06:30.346 --> 06:31.652
Her master was
a 12-year-old girl.

06:31.695 --> 06:34.132
She's been 12 for 150 years.

06:34.176 --> 06:35.482
I'd say her job
hasn't been easy.

06:35.525 --> 06:37.005
She's paid her dues, and...

06:37.048 --> 06:38.267
she's a vampire now.

06:38.310 --> 06:39.442
I am so...

06:39.486 --> 06:41.488
happy for her.

06:43.533 --> 06:45.579
That's so cool
that you are now a...

06:45.622 --> 06:47.624
Are... Is that real...

06:47.668 --> 06:48.625
blood?

06:48.669 --> 06:50.148
I vape it.
Delicious.

06:50.192 --> 06:52.324
I mean, it's delicious to me,
now that I'm a vampire,

06:52.368 --> 06:54.283
-but you'd probably hate it.
-Probably like it if I was.

06:54.326 --> 06:55.893
No.
It's not for you.

06:55.937 --> 06:57.242
You'd be like...

06:57.286 --> 07:00.071

07:00.115 --> 07:01.943

11 years, so...

07:01.986 --> 07:04.380
11 years?

07:04.424 --> 07:06.643
Wow. Well, I'm not
doing it like that.

07:06.687 --> 07:08.689
I've promised all of my
familiars that they'll be

07:08.732 --> 07:11.126
vampires within eight months,
maximum.

07:11.169 --> 07:12.519
-Eight months?
-I'm building

07:12.562 --> 07:14.825
a vampire community.

vampire dance,

clear of your current master.

Yes, of course, but I needto speak to you about something.

08:46.961 --> 08:49.964
-It's personal.
-Oh, no.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.574
No, it's okay, Guillermo.
You really don't have to.

08:51.618 --> 08:54.577
If it's difficult to say,
it's probably best...

08:54.621 --> 08:57.798
-Take a seat, Master.
-Oh... shit.

09:02.890 --> 09:06.241
Master, are you planning
on making me a vampire?

09:07.285 --> 09:09.461
Are you bullshitting me on this?

09:09.505 --> 09:11.246
How is it that now

09:11.289 --> 09:13.814
everyone thinks
they can be a vampire?

09:13.857 --> 09:16.599
I told you before,
we'll talk about it later.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.775
You always want to talk
about it later. Well, what if

09:18.819 --> 09:20.821
I have a better offer
right now? Hmm?

09:20.864 --> 09:22.083
-What, right now?
-Yes.

09:22.126 --> 09:23.824
Then you should take it.

09:23.867 --> 09:25.303
What?

09:26.653 --> 09:27.784
You should take it.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.395
Well, then, I will.

09:30.439 --> 09:31.701
-Okay, then do.
-Okay, then, I will.

09:31.745 --> 09:32.789
Okay, then, you should.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.835
-Then I'll take it. Okay.
-Okay, go.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.576
Great.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.841
Well... are you...

09:40.884 --> 09:42.843
are you gonna be
all right without me?

09:42.886 --> 09:44.714
Yes, I'll be fine.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.760
Thankfully, Benjy has returned,

09:46.803 --> 09:48.413
and Benjy

09:48.457 --> 09:50.677
is the best familiar
I've ever had.

09:50.720 --> 09:54.419
So everything will be okay-A.

09:54.463 --> 09:55.856
A-okay.

09:55.899 --> 09:56.639
O-A-kay.

09:56.683 --> 09:57.901
A-okay.

09:57.945 --> 09:59.816
As I said.

09:59.860 --> 10:03.385
Well, thank you.
I learned a lot from you.

10:06.518 --> 10:08.477
You're being stupid.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.696
What was that?

10:09.739 --> 10:11.523
Uh, nothing.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.569
I didn't say anything.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.832
Okay, then.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.446
NANDOR:
I treated

10:21.490 --> 10:23.318
Guillermo like a son,

10:23.361 --> 10:25.146
and this is how he repays me?

10:25.189 --> 10:27.452
I held that little guy
in my arms

10:27.496 --> 10:30.151
so he could pretend to fly.

10:30.194 --> 10:33.023
GUILLERMO:
Disrespected, unappreciated,

10:33.067 --> 10:34.372
overlooked.

10:34.416 --> 10:35.896
I made him some kind

10:35.939 --> 10:38.594
of glitter picture
on his birthday.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.074
I did all kinds of shit

10:40.117 --> 10:43.817
for him that I can't even
think of right now.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.819
So that's why

10:45.862 --> 10:48.517
I can't be here anymore.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.127
NANDOR:
Listen to me, little man.

10:50.171 --> 10:52.913
From Panera Bread you came,

10:52.956 --> 10:55.872
and to Panera Bread
you shall return.

11:03.227 --> 11:04.968
Hello?

11:05.012 --> 11:06.970
-Hi.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.493
Guillermo!

11:08.537 --> 11:10.321
Come in.

11:10.365 --> 11:12.149
Mwah.
You brought friends.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.629
Ah. Hello.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.196
Wow.

11:15.239 --> 11:16.197
CELESTE:
Welcome. Come in.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.807
GUILLERMO:
Does your master still

11:17.851 --> 11:19.722
-live here with you?
-Ugh, no.

11:19.766 --> 11:22.725
Houston and her clique are downin Florida hunting pervs.

11:22.769 --> 11:25.859
-Cool.
-Everyone,
let's welcome Guillermo.

11:25.902 --> 11:26.903
-Hi, Guillermo.
-Hi.

11:26.947 --> 11:29.514
-And you know Sam, of course?

11:29.558 --> 11:31.516
GUILLERMO:
Oh, yeah. Hey, what's up, Sam?

11:31.560 --> 11:33.997
CELESTE:
His familiar skills
are just unreal.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.651
He did all of this himself.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.522
The plating, the charcuterie.
Can you imagine?

11:37.566 --> 11:39.524
With those little paws.
He's a genius.

11:39.568 --> 11:40.874
-Oh.
-Sit.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.614
Welcome, everyone.

11:42.658 --> 11:45.574
Your presence is a blessing
and a privilege.

11:47.358 --> 11:49.317
So I just have a few rules.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.145
Number one, listen.

11:53.930 --> 11:56.150
Because we are here to grow.

11:56.193 --> 11:58.369
-Yes, Master.
-No "master." I don't believe
in that bullshit.

11:58.413 --> 11:59.806
We don't do that here.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.677
It's okay, you're new.
And one final thing.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.027
Since Guillermo was
the last one here,

12:04.071 --> 12:07.378
it's his turn
to go get the Shake Shack.

12:07.422 --> 12:08.902
-Really? Shake Shack?
-Yes.

12:08.945 --> 12:11.469
-What should I get?
-Get Shake Shack.

12:11.513 --> 12:12.775
-Shake Shack for everyone.
-Yeah.

12:12.819 --> 12:13.994
-CELESTE: Hurry.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.256
Let's take this furniture
outside.

12:15.299 --> 12:17.171
-I don't like it anymore.
-Okay. Totally.

12:20.391 --> 12:22.132
Anytime tomorrow, Benjy.

12:22.176 --> 12:24.656
I'm sorry. I tweaked
the old back last week

12:24.700 --> 12:27.181
-playing golf with the grandson.-I'm not interested.

12:27.224 --> 12:29.661
Might be easier if I just
go get you a new pair.

12:29.705 --> 12:32.012
-Do you have five bucks?
-That's not what
shoes cost anymore.

12:32.055 --> 12:34.057
What happened to those
white platform shoes?

12:34.101 --> 12:36.625
-I gave them away to a homeless.-You looked so tall in them.

12:36.668 --> 12:39.802
-Well, they were stupid.
-So, what do you boogie in?

12:39.846 --> 12:40.803
-I...
-You can't boogie in these.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.022
I don't boogie.

12:42.065 --> 12:43.284
-Nobody boogies anymore.
-Oh.

12:43.327 --> 12:44.589
-What are you doing?
-You got me thinking

12:44.633 --> 12:46.026
about playing golf
with my grandson.

12:46.069 --> 12:47.810
-You got to see this kid.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.812
He swings a club
like a young Tiger...

12:49.856 --> 12:51.248
-Tiger.
-Tiger Woods.

12:51.292 --> 12:52.684
Tiger Woods.
That's the fella.

12:52.728 --> 12:53.947
I don't even know
what "jolf" is,

12:53.990 --> 12:55.949
but I know his name
is Tiger Woods.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.298
Where the hell's his picture?

12:57.341 --> 12:59.866
That's my finger.
That's my finger.

12:59.909 --> 13:02.303
That's my finger.

13:02.346 --> 13:03.957
♪ My baby's gone,
got me feeling so low♪

13:04.000 --> 13:05.436
♪ My Lindbergh baby,
where did he go?♪

13:05.480 --> 13:07.874
No.
Laszlo, it is too fast.

13:07.917 --> 13:10.659
-It has to have a ballad tempo.-No, it doesn't.

13:10.702 --> 13:13.618
You seem to forget
that I am the tempo king.

13:13.662 --> 13:16.273
Oh, well, Your Majesty, please,may I take some tea with you

13:16.317 --> 13:18.058
and ask you to slow it down?!

13:18.101 --> 13:21.235
Nadja, if we slowed this down,it would stop forever and a day.

13:21.278 --> 13:23.237
NADJA:
I am now remembering why

13:23.280 --> 13:25.892
me and Laszlo haven't
collaborated in decades.

13:25.935 --> 13:28.982
Because sometimes he can be
a giant dipshit with no taste.

13:29.025 --> 13:30.766
LASZLO: She does have a way with words,

13:30.810 --> 13:32.986
but sometimes those words
drive me fucking insane.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.335
NADJA:
You haven't had

13:34.378 --> 13:36.641
an original idea since 1925,
when you decided

13:36.685 --> 13:39.514
to go down on mefor the first time in 200 years.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.211
-Biggest mistake I ever made.

13:41.255 --> 13:43.518
You said I tasted
like goats' cheese.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.000
Anyway, how dare you?

13:47.043 --> 13:48.088
I was doing the bloody disco

13:48.131 --> 13:50.090
a hundred years
before any other fucker.

13:50.133 --> 13:51.961
I gave you that idea.
Colin Robinson,

13:52.005 --> 13:53.484
this is a private conversation.

13:53.528 --> 13:56.052
Sorry, I-I just
wanted to pop in and say

13:56.096 --> 13:58.925
-be sure you do some new songs.-Why?

13:58.968 --> 14:02.972
Every time I go to a rock
concert and the singer says,

14:03.016 --> 14:05.105
"Okay, we're gonna take a breakfrom the hits and do

14:05.148 --> 14:08.108
some of our new material,"
the crowd goes bananas.

14:08.151 --> 14:10.023
-  -NANDOR: I have been wondering

14:10.066 --> 14:13.287
if perhaps I was
a little too relentless

14:13.330 --> 14:14.331
with Guillermo.

14:14.375 --> 14:15.724
Get out of the way.

14:15.767 --> 14:18.466
Like all humans
approaching death,

14:18.509 --> 14:21.773
Benjy is mostly interested
in "jolf".

14:21.817 --> 14:23.775
-Watch the hips.
-Uh, yeah. Okay.

14:23.819 --> 14:25.952
Shoot...
Chop that thing!

14:25.995 --> 14:28.128
He's not as strong
as Guillermo,

14:28.171 --> 14:29.129
nor as quick.

14:29.172 --> 14:30.304
He's frail,

14:30.347 --> 14:31.783
like a baby.

14:31.827 --> 14:33.394
A big, wrinkly baby

14:33.437 --> 14:34.961
that smells of

14:35.004 --> 14:36.092
mashed potatoes.

14:36.136 --> 14:37.964
Let me do it.

14:38.007 --> 14:41.097
Sorry, Master. I'll be strongerwhen I'm a vampire.

14:43.186 --> 14:45.145
So I think I'll pay
Guillermo a visit.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.929
Watch out, there's a slippy bit.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.889
He must be dying
to come back by now.

14:51.542 --> 14:54.502
-Do you like my room?
-Uh, yes.

14:54.545 --> 14:57.287
It's very nice.
Big.

14:57.331 --> 14:59.159
-Is that me?
-No.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.988
-That's me.
-Nope.

15:02.031 --> 15:03.206
That's you.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.034
That's not...

15:05.078 --> 15:07.210
If I knew you liked
big rooms, you know,

15:07.254 --> 15:09.038
maybe I could've moved you
into the big blue room

15:09.082 --> 15:11.171
-upstairs in Staten Island.
-No.

15:11.214 --> 15:13.173
I don't need more room
at that house.

15:13.216 --> 15:16.916
You know, Celeste always comes
in here and just talks.

15:18.004 --> 15:21.790
Well, I like just talking, too.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.879
-Since when?
-Since...

15:25.881 --> 15:27.404
-Since...
-Okay.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.406
I'm gonna go see what
everyone else is doing.

15:29.450 --> 15:32.235
-But I thought we were
just talking.
-We're not talking.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.981
The fuck is that shit?

15:39.025 --> 15:42.245
Ah! And the couch
over here but upright,

15:42.289 --> 15:44.595
-because that's how I sleep now.-Why are you being like this?

15:44.639 --> 15:45.901
-Come on.
-CELESTE:
All the young vampires

15:45.945 --> 15:46.989
are switching to couches.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.425
GUILLERMO:
These are my people now.

15:48.469 --> 15:50.993
Guillermo!
Come, practice.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.255
It's interpretive dance,

15:52.299 --> 15:54.040
so you need to be
telling a story

15:54.083 --> 15:55.389
using your body.

15:55.432 --> 15:57.913
Like Pam.
Good luck.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.219
You don't need to be doing that.

15:59.262 --> 16:00.829
Yes, I do.

16:05.181 --> 16:07.053
Be kind to Guillermo.

16:07.096 --> 16:08.706
-CELESTE: What?
-Nothing.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.143
Sorry.
Can I get...

16:10.186 --> 16:14.016
You mind if I...
Just going to go this way.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.149
Fucking girl.

16:16.192 --> 16:18.499
MAN:
Why is that when I eat M&M'S,

16:18.542 --> 16:21.676
M&M'S thinks
that I have to be horny?

16:21.719 --> 16:25.027
Worked better at the Cellar.
Okay.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.463
-Thank you so much...
-Colin Robinson,

16:26.507 --> 16:28.857
what is an open mic night?

16:28.900 --> 16:32.165
It's a prestigious showcase
of top-level talent.

16:32.208 --> 16:34.036
They call it "open mic" because

16:34.080 --> 16:36.952
they only open the mic
for the best of the best.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.041
-Naturally.
-So, we're gonna
switch things up

16:39.085 --> 16:41.087
with a little bit of music
for you right now.

16:41.130 --> 16:44.264
Coming at you from the deepest
part of Staten Island,

16:44.307 --> 16:47.093
-let's give a warm
Chop House welcome to...
-Oh.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.312
-...Lass...
-LASZLO: Laszlo, dickhead.

16:49.356 --> 16:52.272
Lassezlo undNadia.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.665
NADJA :
Hello, everybody.

16:54.709 --> 16:57.451
I'm Nadja, and this is Laszlo,
and we are Nadja and Laszlo,

16:57.494 --> 16:59.192
the human music group.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.070
This is a love song
to my wife, Nadja.

17:08.114 --> 17:11.204
♪ You took my heart
like no one♪

17:11.247 --> 17:14.207
♪ In this town♪

17:14.250 --> 17:17.297
♪ In this town♪

17:17.340 --> 17:19.777

17:19.821 --> 17:23.346
-♪ We fly up and down♪
-♪ Up and down♪

17:23.390 --> 17:26.436
-♪ Up and down♪
-♪ Up and...♪

17:26.480 --> 17:29.309
Ugh, the couch.

17:29.352 --> 17:30.875
I hate it now.

17:30.919 --> 17:33.008
Go. Fix it.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.010
Uh, Celeste?
Sorry to bug.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.925
You said you were gonna start
making us vampires, quote,

17:36.968 --> 17:39.971
"Hopefully within the week."
And that was last week.

17:40.015 --> 17:41.147
Is someone talking to me
right now?

17:41.190 --> 17:42.322
GUILLERMO:
That's actually true.

17:42.365 --> 17:44.150
You did say that.
And I don't want

17:44.193 --> 17:45.238
-to be a bugaboo.
-CELESTE: Bugaboo?

17:45.281 --> 17:47.109
But you know
what it's like for us.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.676
What is this, an ambush?

17:48.719 --> 17:50.330
BRAD:
Sort of, like, a timeline

17:50.373 --> 17:52.767
-would mean a l-lot.
