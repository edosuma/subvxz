I'm-a order some

-Oh, yeah? Get me some.
-Anybody else want an order?

00:13.874 --> 00:15.676
A delivery
of chili cheese fries?

00:15.709 --> 00:18.546
They'll be mush by the time
they get here. No way.

-Ah! Shit.
-[scoffs, laughs]

00:21.382 --> 00:23.918
What are you doing, man?
You can't hit it that hard.

00:23.951 --> 00:25.719
You got to use more finesse.

00:25.753 --> 00:27.288
Well, finesse isn't
really my style, Charlie.

00:27.321 --> 00:29.790
I like to dominate the table

Tip me out.

-Give me my tips.

00:34.028 --> 00:35.496
What tips, Dee?
What are you talking about?

Hey, any of you guys
tip Dee today?

-Hell no.

-[Dee] All right, whatever.

I just need a little cash.

Where you going?

00:47.608 --> 00:51.345
I'm going to a fancy place with

-What friends?
-What is happening?

00:53.013 --> 00:54.615
Why is everyone
asking me questions?

00:54.648 --> 00:55.950
Well, it's 'cause you're
sneaking around trying

to take off the coat,

Dee, why were you hiding
that from us?

01:29.984 --> 01:31.685
Because it's my thing, okay?
It's not your thing,

01:31.719 --> 01:33.687

-Mine was.
-Yeah, so was mine.

01:56.110 --> 01:57.678
Yeah, I was scratching mine
when she said that.

I-I had my hands
fully down my pants,

01:59.413 --> 02:00.514

that you're not the leader

everyone's names.

-I told you it was stupid.

06:43.764 --> 06:45.566
I-I knew they were gonna
make fun of us

06:45.599 --> 06:47.334
-and they did make fun of us.
-Yeah, 'cause it's stupid.

Uh, but it doesn't matter,

06:48.869 --> 06:50.471
'cause you guys are dead meat.

06:50.504 --> 06:53.374
Hey, did Dee happen
to tell you the history

06:53.407 --> 06:55.309
of her experience with bowling?

06:55.342 --> 06:57.511
-No.
-[Mac] You should tell them,
you should tell them.

06:57.545 --> 06:59.780
-You tell them, you tell them.
-Tell them, tell them.
-I-I was about to.

06:59.814 --> 07:01.882
-I don't know.
-Oh, you were?
-I was about to. Yes.

07:01.916 --> 07:04.051
-[cackles] Are we doing
the laugh?
-[laughs] He's gonna tell you.

07:04.084 --> 07:05.753
-Are we doing laughs?
-Yeah, uh, no.
I'll just tell it.

-Okay, well, when she was a kid,

07:08.022 --> 07:10.524
she was, well,
she was pretty decent.

07:10.558 --> 07:12.893
And I got to say, she worked
really, really hard at it.

07:12.927 --> 07:16.597
So, she eventually became
the captain of the girls' team.

07:16.630 --> 07:17.865
Can you believe that?

07:17.898 --> 07:20.334
Now, I'm no fan
of women's sports.

-Yeah, they're not very popular.
-Nobody is.

Especially women.

07:23.904 --> 07:24.872

women's sports.

07:24.905 --> 07:26.740
So I wouldn't have it.

07:26.774 --> 07:31.512
And to prove that Dee's
female mind was mentally weak,

07:31.545 --> 07:33.514
I started to go watch her,

07:33.547 --> 07:36.517
and I would say, "gutter ball"

07:36.550 --> 07:39.954
right before she rolled it,
and wouldn't you know it,
