[instrumental music]

00:13.404 --> 00:15.319
[indistinct chatter]

00:17.104 --> 00:18.801
Hey. Victim's name
is John Flynn.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.934
He's 48. Married.
Cho's bringing the wife now.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.327
And CEO of a company
called Symphony.

00:23.414 --> 00:24.807
Symphony?

00:24.894 --> 00:26.983
Website says it's
a high-end matchmaking service.

00:27.070 --> 00:29.029
Rich old men looking
for hot young chicks?

00:29.116 --> 00:32.119
Yep. Flynn was shot twice
in the chest at close range

00:32.206 --> 00:33.903
'then dumped
or fell in the water.'

00:33.990 --> 00:35.557
'A woman heard
the pops from her boat'

00:35.644 --> 00:38.690
putting the time of death
at 5:38 p.m. last night.

00:38.777 --> 00:42.564
- Did she see anything?
- No. No witnesses.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.087
Bruising looks
to be a few days old.

00:44.174 --> 00:45.741
Coroner thought the same.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.047
'So far he
and forensics haven't'

00:47.134 --> 00:49.049
found much else that helps us.

00:50.615 --> 00:53.009
[instrumental music]

00:55.925 --> 00:58.536
Jane, anything
to add before we go?

00:58.623 --> 01:02.366
Yeah, the sun and the sea.
Isn't it wonderful?

01:02.453 --> 01:04.455
Anything to add
about the victim?

01:04.542 --> 01:07.154
Rich guy, CEO,
probably killed over money.

01:07.241 --> 01:09.678
- Way of the world.
- That's all you got?

01:09.765 --> 01:11.984
Do you know in seven years,
each and every cell is

01:12.072 --> 01:13.986
completely replaced
in your body?

01:14.074 --> 01:16.293
That means you are literally
a different person

01:16.380 --> 01:18.339
from when we first met.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.384
Sadder but wiser.

01:20.471 --> 01:22.517
He's very wet.

01:22.604 --> 01:24.475
That must mean something.

01:28.479 --> 01:30.873
[no audio]

01:40.448 --> 01:42.537
- Grieving widow?
- Yeah.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.111
Hello.

01:51.198 --> 01:52.808
Hi.

01:52.895 --> 01:54.636
You were watching me.

01:54.723 --> 01:56.116
Yes.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.248
- Why?
- It's my job.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.645
Your husband was murdered
at the marina last night.

02:03.732 --> 02:04.907
Yes.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.346
Sorry for your loss.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.435
Thank you.

02:11.522 --> 02:13.263
You seem genuinely upset.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.091
Does that surprise you?

02:15.178 --> 02:16.701
How long were you
and your husband married?

02:16.788 --> 02:18.442
I'm sorry.
I don't know your name.

02:18.529 --> 02:20.314
Patrick.

02:20.401 --> 02:21.924
Erica.

02:22.011 --> 02:24.144
About a year.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.150
What do you see?

02:30.237 --> 02:32.543
You're independent,
ambitious, competitive

02:32.630 --> 02:34.632
yet you have
a warmth about you

02:34.719 --> 02:36.852
enough to charm
the stoic Agent Cho

02:36.939 --> 02:39.768
which is no small feat,
let me tell you.

02:39.855 --> 02:43.728
You're skilled at getting people
to open up to you, to trust you.

02:43.815 --> 02:45.469
And there's a question
of whether you use that skill

02:45.556 --> 02:49.038
to help people
or to manipulate them.

02:50.735 --> 02:53.738
A little of both,
if I'm being honest.

02:53.825 --> 02:56.567
I'm a matchmaker.
I help people find true love.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.395
Ah.

02:58.482 --> 03:00.354
You think it's silly.

03:00.441 --> 03:02.660
No. Good enough job,
I imagine.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.749
You think the idea
of true love is silly.

03:04.836 --> 03:05.794
No.

03:07.752 --> 03:10.102
- That explains it.
- Explains what?

03:10.190 --> 03:12.192
The utter sadness
I see in you.

03:15.499 --> 03:16.718
We're all finished,
Mrs. Flynn.

03:16.805 --> 03:17.762
I could walk you out,
if you like.

03:17.849 --> 03:18.850
Thank you, Agent Cho.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.287
You've been very good to me.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.245
I'll walk her out,
if you don't mind.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.204
- Not at all.
- Sure.

03:30.949 --> 03:33.038
It was very nice
to meet you, Patrick.

03:33.125 --> 03:36.607
Hopefully next time it'll be
under better circumstances.

03:38.783 --> 03:42.352
You know,
every day women come to me

03:42.439 --> 03:44.267
hoping I'll help
them find a kind

03:44.354 --> 03:47.401
gentle man
to fall in love with.

03:47.488 --> 03:49.707
I'm sure any one of them
would be lucky to meet you.

03:56.453 --> 03:57.933
What was that all about?

03:58.020 --> 04:00.457
Oh, she's just thanking me
for consoling her.

04:00.544 --> 04:03.504
Oh, and here I thought
you hated talking to widows.

04:03.591 --> 04:05.593
This one's a little different.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.682
How so?

04:07.769 --> 04:09.597
She murdered her husband.

04:09.684 --> 04:12.556
[theme music]

04:23.001 --> 04:25.090
You're right. Usually,
it's the victim's spouse

04:25.177 --> 04:27.745
who's the murderer,
but Erica Flynn has an alibi.

04:27.832 --> 04:29.921
Mm. I'd expect
nothing less from her.

04:30.008 --> 04:31.793
One of her clients
is in with Rigsby right now

04:31.880 --> 04:34.491
and she swears that she was
with Erica at the time of death.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.319
Then I must be wrong.

04:36.406 --> 04:39.148
She did say that her husband
got in a fight a few days ago.

04:39.235 --> 04:40.584
He came home with a bruise.

04:40.671 --> 04:41.716
She doesn't know
who the fight was with.

04:41.803 --> 04:42.978
Any guesses?

04:43.065 --> 04:44.501
The reality is John Flynn

04:44.588 --> 04:46.111
ran a multi-million
dollar company.

04:46.198 --> 04:48.331
He had money,
dozens of employees

04:48.418 --> 04:49.680
and a lot
of ruthless competitors.

04:49.767 --> 04:51.116
And Flynn's file also says

04:51.203 --> 04:52.422
that he gave half
a million dollars

04:52.509 --> 04:53.728
to charity last year.

04:53.815 --> 04:55.730
That's the first time
he's ever done that.

04:55.817 --> 04:57.862
- So?
- It's a red flag.

04:57.949 --> 05:00.343
How is giving
to charity a red flag?

05:00.430 --> 05:02.127
Giving to charity
isn't a red flag.

05:02.214 --> 05:06.044
Giving half a million dollars
to charity out of the blue is.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.785
It's a sure sign
of a guilty conscience.

05:07.872 --> 05:09.439
That is so far from the truth.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.093
Well, think about
the people that donate

05:11.180 --> 05:12.790
that kind of money to charity.

05:12.877 --> 05:14.792
Alright, Wall Street executives

05:14.879 --> 05:17.447
crooked politicians,
troubled celebrities.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.710
It is all in the name
of clearing their conscience.

05:19.797 --> 05:21.973
You're horrible.

05:22.060 --> 05:24.149
How long have you been
a member of Symphony?

05:24.236 --> 05:26.064
Oh, just a few days, actually.

05:26.151 --> 05:28.023
Night before last was
my first interview with Erica.

05:28.110 --> 05:29.111
And what time was this?

05:29.198 --> 05:32.070
From 5:00 until
just after 6:00.

05:32.157 --> 05:33.245
And you're convinced
that Erica Flynn was there

05:33.333 --> 05:34.508
the entire time?

05:34.595 --> 05:36.945
- Yes.
- Can anyone confirm that?

05:37.032 --> 05:38.947
Oh, I think
the rest of the staff

05:39.034 --> 05:40.992
had already left the office
by the time we started.

05:41.079 --> 05:44.169
I'm a litigator, so that was
the earliest I could meet Erica.

05:44.256 --> 05:46.650
Oh, it's probably why I joined
the service in the first place.

05:46.737 --> 05:48.957
It's not that I'm some
social leper or anything.

05:49.044 --> 05:51.916
I mean, I can meet people.
I meet people all the time.

05:52.003 --> 05:54.745
So...no?

05:54.832 --> 05:57.052
No.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.184
- But there's the DVD.
- The DVD?

05:59.271 --> 06:00.577
Of the interview.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.274
Yeah, it's part of,
uh, Symphony's service.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.974
A client interview, appearance
counseling, date coaching.

06:06.061 --> 06:09.456
It's actually a very thorough
approach to matchmaking.

06:09.543 --> 06:13.198
Anyway, Erica was
interviewing me the whole time.

06:13.285 --> 06:15.723
Just see for yourself.

06:15.810 --> 06:17.333
Um..

06:17.420 --> 06:19.727
Just, just, God, don't show it
to too many people

06:19.814 --> 06:21.468
'cause it's
kind of embarrassing.

06:21.555 --> 06:22.817
And they haven't edited out

06:22.904 --> 06:26.647
all my silly faces,
dumb comments yet.

06:26.734 --> 06:30.433
Oh, my god. Okay, it's fine.
You can watch it.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.914
I mean, for investigative
purposes, obviously.

06:33.001 --> 06:34.742
Not that if you wanted
to watch it

06:34.829 --> 06:37.266
for other reasons you couldn't.

06:37.353 --> 06:40.704
Got it. Uh, well, we'll call
with any other questions.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.445
- Thanks for your time.
- Okay, right.

06:42.532 --> 06:44.447
Well, no, thank you.

06:44.534 --> 06:46.580
Um..

06:46.667 --> 06:50.801
Alright, I-I had..
I have a question.

06:50.888 --> 06:54.109
I will just..

06:54.196 --> 06:58.200
...are you
in a relationship?

06:58.287 --> 07:01.159
No. Um, I'm not, actually.

07:01.246 --> 07:03.379
Oh.

07:03.466 --> 07:05.512
Well, good to know.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.603
Uh, nice to meet you,
Agent Rigsby.

07:09.690 --> 07:12.214
Nice to meet you, Sarah.

07:12.301 --> 07:14.259
- Uh, this way.
- Right.

07:19.177 --> 07:22.180
Hey, boss.
You gotta see this.

07:22.267 --> 07:27.142
It's a video of John Flynn's
ex-wife, Kim Cartwright.

07:27.229 --> 07:30.580
I found it online
while doing background.

07:30.667 --> 07:33.496
Three months ago,
my husband of 21 years

07:33.583 --> 07:36.891
John Flynn,
told me he was divorcing me.

07:36.978 --> 07:39.197
'John said
he wanted to be alone'

07:39.284 --> 07:42.070
that he didn't want
to be married anymore.

07:42.157 --> 07:45.682
Well, John, this is what I think
of your settlement agreement.

07:45.769 --> 07:47.467
Word is out on you, John.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.251
I am going to tell everyone

07:49.338 --> 07:51.166
exactly what kind
of a man you are.

07:51.253 --> 07:54.343
Because you are a pig.
You are a coward.

07:54.430 --> 07:58.739
I made that video
over a year ago. I was upset.

07:58.826 --> 08:00.654
You were more than upset,
Ms. Cartwright.

08:00.741 --> 08:03.874
You threatened to make your
ex-husband's life miserable.

08:03.961 --> 08:06.137
Talk to me
when your ex-husband

08:06.224 --> 08:09.314
remarries someone ten years
younger and two sizes smaller.

08:09.401 --> 08:10.446
[barking]

08:10.533 --> 08:12.013
Shh. Libby, no. No bark

08:12.100 --> 08:13.754
[whimpers]

08:13.841 --> 08:15.407
Where were you that night?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.714
I was home alone.

08:17.801 --> 08:20.108
I didn't kill John,
if that's what you're thinking.

08:20.195 --> 08:21.457
Shh. Shh.

08:24.460 --> 08:28.203
Oh, my God. That's what
you're thinking. That's insane.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.987
John and I
reconciled months ago.

08:30.074 --> 08:31.511
W-we spoke all the time.

08:31.598 --> 08:32.947
[barking]

08:33.034 --> 08:35.166
Including the afternoon
he was murdered.

08:35.253 --> 08:37.299
Do you recall
what you two talked about?

08:37.386 --> 08:39.606
John was unhappy
in his marriage

08:39.693 --> 08:41.564
and he needed
someone to listen.

08:41.651 --> 08:43.305
So he called his ex-wife?

08:43.392 --> 08:45.220
Okay, it's complicated,
alright?

08:45.307 --> 08:48.571
Shh. Shh. Bad dog.
Shh. No bark.

08:50.355 --> 08:53.620
You said John was unhappy
in his marriage. Why?

08:53.707 --> 08:55.665
Well, John loved his company,
but he was ready

08:55.752 --> 08:57.493
to step back
and enjoy life and..

08:57.580 --> 08:58.538
[barking]

08:58.625 --> 08:59.800
Erica didn't feel that way.

08:59.887 --> 09:02.063
She kept pushing him
to expand Symphony.

09:02.150 --> 09:03.455
It caused problems
between them.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.718
[snaps fingers]
Shh.

09:04.805 --> 09:05.849
[whimpers]

09:08.548 --> 09:10.898
When we found John, he had
a bruise over his left eye.

09:10.985 --> 09:12.943
He mentioned
that he'd gotten into a fight

09:13.030 --> 09:15.119
with an ex-client,
Henry Cliff.

09:15.206 --> 09:16.860
You know what
the fight was about?

09:16.947 --> 09:18.906
No, he was evasive.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.777
It was something
he didn't want to share.

09:20.864 --> 09:22.562
Did you know Erica Flynn signed
a prenup before she got married?

09:22.649 --> 09:24.128
You're barking
up the wrong tree.

09:24.215 --> 09:26.435
Time stamp puts the start
of the meeting at 5:00 p.m.

09:26.522 --> 09:28.916
Finishes just after 6:00,
just like Sarah said

09:29.003 --> 09:30.482
which means that Erica Flynn

09:30.570 --> 09:33.181
'was at her office
at the time of the murder.'

09:33.268 --> 09:34.486
[Erica]
'It'll allow
yourfuture soul mate'

09:34.574 --> 09:35.923
'tobetterconnect with you.'

09:36.010 --> 09:37.707
What do you think of these
dating services anyway?

09:37.794 --> 09:40.101
- No and yes.
- What?

09:40.188 --> 09:42.146
No, I've never used one,
and yes, you should.

09:42.233 --> 09:43.800
Oh, because you're cool,
and I'm not?

09:43.887 --> 09:46.281
Anything to stop
you dating your co-workers.

09:46.368 --> 09:47.674
[Erica]
'How would your
closest friends describe you'

09:47.761 --> 09:49.327
'tosomeone
who doesn't know you?'

09:49.414 --> 09:52.504
Oh. Well,
I think they would say..

09:52.592 --> 09:56.596
Uh, we have you scheduled to
come in next Tuesday.

09:56.683 --> 10:00.600
Okay, great. See you then.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.210
Welcome to Symphony.

10:02.297 --> 10:03.515
If you'll just
fill out this profile

10:03.603 --> 10:05.039
someone will be
with you shortly.

10:05.126 --> 10:06.344
Profile.

10:06.431 --> 10:10.087
Patrick.
I see you two have met.

10:10.174 --> 10:12.786
Peter's our reception clerk
though I doubt for much longer.

10:12.873 --> 10:17.051
He's a very talented musician,
writes such beautiful music.

10:17.138 --> 10:18.922
Patrick
is a consultant with CBI.

10:19.009 --> 10:21.795
He's investigating
John's murder.

10:21.882 --> 10:23.753
I'll hold your calls.

10:28.018 --> 10:30.325
We're all a little overwhelmed
today, as you can imagine.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.022
I shouldn't even be here.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.937
But to be honest,
I didn't have much of a choice.

10:34.024 --> 10:38.638
With John gone,
well...you understand.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.161
Is there any news
in the investigation?

10:40.248 --> 10:41.902
No.

10:41.989 --> 10:44.513
Do you have
any more questions for me?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.123
Not really.

10:47.734 --> 10:50.824
- I think I understand.
- Understand what?

10:50.911 --> 10:52.390
Why you're here.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.044
I wasn't sure
at first when I saw your ring

10:54.131 --> 10:55.742
but you're single,
aren't you?

10:55.829 --> 10:57.178
That's not why I'm here.

10:57.265 --> 10:59.223
There's nothing
to be ashamed of, Patrick.

10:59.310 --> 11:00.398
I've helped
a great many clients

11:00.485 --> 11:02.096
in the exact
same situation as you.

11:02.183 --> 11:05.012
Well, I'm not in a situation.
There's no situation.

11:05.099 --> 11:07.579
I know what you're feeling.
I've been there.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.191
Yeah,
I don't think you have.

11:10.278 --> 11:13.150
You were in a relationship once,
you were in love

11:13.237 --> 11:16.850
but it ended badly, and you were
deeply hurt as a result.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.329
Your shut yourself off
from the world

11:18.416 --> 11:20.027
and avoid meeting new people
because you don't want

11:20.114 --> 11:22.159
to ever feel that loss again.

11:24.901 --> 11:27.599
But now you're ready
to move on with your life.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.732
I can see it in you.

11:29.819 --> 11:33.518
Youcanfind happiness again,
even true love

11:33.605 --> 11:36.086
but you have to be willing
to let me help you.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.524
[chuckles]

11:42.179 --> 11:44.965
That was spooky.
It was like you read my mind.

11:46.967 --> 11:49.012
Our in-house studio
is right this way.

11:49.099 --> 11:51.188
It's where we conduct
our client interviews.

11:51.275 --> 11:53.321
How many interviews
have you conducted here?

11:53.408 --> 11:55.627
Enough to know
what I'm doing.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.501
Whoa. That's bright.

11:59.588 --> 12:01.024
Very fancy.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.595
We like to show our clients
in the best possible light.

12:06.682 --> 12:08.379
I thought
true love was blind.

12:08.466 --> 12:12.166
We may love with our hearts,
but first we lust with our eyes.

12:12.253 --> 12:14.821
Don't you agree?

12:14.908 --> 12:17.040
If you make yourself
comfortable, we can get started.

12:17.127 --> 12:18.172
- Here?
- Yeah.

12:18.259 --> 12:19.434
Okay.

12:22.132 --> 12:23.960
Try to look directly
into the camera.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.440
It will allow
your future soul mate

12:25.527 --> 12:27.442
to better connect with you.

12:29.357 --> 12:30.532
How's that?

12:30.619 --> 12:32.664
Perfect. I'm gonna ask you

12:32.752 --> 12:34.318
'a series
of standardized questions.'

12:34.405 --> 12:36.364
'These have been designed to get
at the heart of who you are'

12:36.451 --> 12:38.192
and who
you're compatible with.

12:38.279 --> 12:41.064
Try to answer
as honestly as possible. Ready?

12:41.151 --> 12:42.674
- Yes.
- Good.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.198
Now, Patrick

12:44.285 --> 12:47.810
what kind of woman
are you interested in?

12:47.897 --> 12:49.333
Rich, quiet blondes.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.988
No snoring.
That's a deal-breaker.

12:52.075 --> 12:55.513
We were told
you punched out John Flynn.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.865
Yeah, I hit John.

12:58.952 --> 13:01.258
- It was a misunderstanding.
- Who misunderstood what?

13:01.345 --> 13:02.738
It was nothing, a tiff.

13:02.825 --> 13:05.654
Two days
before he was murdered.

13:05.741 --> 13:06.829
Am I under arrest?

13:06.916 --> 13:08.048
No, you're just
a person of interest

13:08.135 --> 13:09.658
at this point, a suspect.

13:09.745 --> 13:12.879
Unless you can clear things up
with a simple explanation.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.925
[exhales deeply]

13:16.012 --> 13:17.797
Alright.

13:23.411 --> 13:25.761
It was about a woman, okay?

13:25.848 --> 13:30.200
Naomi. Met her at a singles
mixer John's company organized.

13:30.287 --> 13:32.637
We hit it off at the bar,
a few drinks, few laughs.

13:32.724 --> 13:35.553
Next thing I know,
she invites me up to her room.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.252
Alright? I'm up there,
what, two seconds

13:38.339 --> 13:40.994
boom, she is all over me.

13:41.081 --> 13:43.518
I mean, really hot
and really passionate.

13:43.605 --> 13:45.999
Get to the part
where you punch out John Flynn.

13:46.086 --> 13:48.740
Yeah, right, uh..

13:48.828 --> 13:51.482
Two days later,
I get a phone call.

13:51.569 --> 13:54.485
I think she wants another bite
off the old cliff bar, right?

13:54.572 --> 13:59.055
No. Turns out
the bitch is blackmailing me.

13:59.142 --> 14:02.015
Says she videotaped
our whole night together.

14:02.102 --> 14:05.366
Says unless I give her $15,000

14:05.453 --> 14:07.847
she's going public
with that video.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.370
You paid the money?

14:09.457 --> 14:13.200
Well, yeah. I can't have
a sex tape going around.

14:13.287 --> 14:17.204
Look, I'm a Sac Metro
top ten prestige realtor.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.380
My face is
on the friggin' billboard.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.208
I get respect
in this community.

14:21.295 --> 14:23.384
So you went after Flynn.

14:23.471 --> 14:26.822
He's supposed to be screening
these women for Pete's sake.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.780
But look
it's not what you think.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.087
John and I talked it out.

14:31.174 --> 14:34.221
He swore to me that he would
handle it personally

14:34.308 --> 14:36.832
said he was gonna make sure
she got caught

14:36.919 --> 14:38.790
and put in jail
for what she did.

14:40.618 --> 14:44.318
So much for that plan, right?

14:44.405 --> 14:46.450
I have just
one more question.

14:46.537 --> 14:49.976
In an ideal world, what would
you want your life to be like?

14:50.063 --> 14:51.499
Haven't thought about that.

14:51.586 --> 14:54.328
In an ideal world..

14:57.635 --> 14:59.202
A pet dragon, definitely

14:59.289 --> 15:01.161
for flying around on.
That would be good.

15:01.248 --> 15:02.902
Please try
and answer seriously.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.207
It's important.

15:04.294 --> 15:07.863
What do you want
from your life?

15:07.950 --> 15:10.170
I want my life
to be free.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.694
Free how?
To love? To be loved?

15:12.781 --> 15:15.044
Free from my past.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.360
I wanna tell you something.

15:26.447 --> 15:29.580
Every day I introduce men
and women to one another.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.105
If I do my job well,
those people connect.

15:32.192 --> 15:33.802
They spark.

15:33.889 --> 15:37.327
I can actually see it.

15:37.414 --> 15:41.331
Just like I see it in you
right now with me.

15:41.418 --> 15:44.117
I don't say this
to make you uncomfortable.

15:44.204 --> 15:45.770
'I say it
because I want you to know'

15:45.857 --> 15:47.990
'no matter how alone you feel'

15:48.077 --> 15:52.255
you are capable
of finding love, of moving on.

15:52.342 --> 15:55.171
I was wondering
when you'd do this.

15:55.258 --> 15:58.435
- Do what?
- Try to manipulate me.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.394
I would never do that.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.962
I'm simply pointing out emotions
I know you feel towards me.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.964
You're wrong.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.617
I don't feel
anything like that towards you

16:06.704 --> 16:09.533
for one very good reason,
you murdered your husband.

16:12.188 --> 16:15.409
- That's not funny.
- It wasn't meant to be.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.411
Why would I kill my husband?

16:17.498 --> 16:20.457
Money, well, money
and control of the company.

16:20.544 --> 16:22.546
Same difference, really.
John was gonna leave you.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.505
And if he left,
the company left with him.

16:24.592 --> 16:27.899
Everything that you worked for,
everything that you'd built

16:27.987 --> 16:30.337
gone.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.165
And you couldn't
let that happen.

16:32.252 --> 16:33.296
No.

16:33.383 --> 16:36.778
You're
all about autonomy, control.

16:36.865 --> 16:39.476
Abused as a child, I expect.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.481
I didn't kill my husband.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.440
In fact, you don't actually
believe I did.

16:46.527 --> 16:48.485
- No?
- No

16:48.572 --> 16:49.878
You're simply doing what

16:49.965 --> 16:52.315
you've been doing
ever since your wife died

16:52.402 --> 16:54.404
'intentionally sabotaging
any relationship'

16:54.491 --> 16:57.146
'by pushing away anyone
who makes you feel something.'

16:57.233 --> 16:58.626
You want me to be the killer

16:58.713 --> 17:01.672
because you don't want
to have feelings for me.

17:01.759 --> 17:03.283
It's a tragic,
but natural response

17:03.370 --> 17:06.590
to the guilt you feel
over your wife's death.

17:06.677 --> 17:09.028
I do push people away

17:09.115 --> 17:12.509
and I do feel guilt
over my wife's death

17:12.596 --> 17:15.208
but that doesn't change the fact
that you murdered your husband.

17:15.295 --> 17:17.906
I'm more certain
of it now than ever.

17:19.690 --> 17:22.519
If that's the case, prove it.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.397
[instrumental music]

17:31.876 --> 17:34.488
Where are we
with the Flynn murder?

17:34.575 --> 17:36.620
Rigsby and I are still checking
out Henry Cliff's alibi.

17:36.707 --> 17:38.231
He said he was in a bar
watching the game

17:38.318 --> 17:39.797
but we still haven't found
anyone to confirm it.

17:39.884 --> 17:42.191
Stay on it.
What about the ex-wife?

17:42.278 --> 17:44.454
Still no alibi either,
but I did find a lawsuit

17:44.541 --> 17:46.500
Kim Cartwright filed against
Flynn around the same time

17:46.587 --> 17:48.241
'she posted that online video.'

17:48.328 --> 17:50.373
Looks like it has something to
do with the divorce settlement.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.158
I'm having the courthouse
messenger over the files.

17:52.245 --> 17:54.073
And the blackmailer, Naomi?

17:54.160 --> 17:55.552
Yeah, we're having some trouble
tracking her down.

17:55.639 --> 17:57.772
Symphony doesn't
have that information?

17:57.859 --> 18:00.644
It's all fake. Photos, driver's
license, social security number.

18:00.731 --> 18:02.385
I mean, the forgery's good, so I
can see how they missed 'em.

18:02.472 --> 18:03.995
All we have is
Cliff's description of her

18:04.083 --> 18:05.301
including a small tattoo
near her hip.

18:05.388 --> 18:08.957
So basically,
we have nothing to go on.

18:09.044 --> 18:12.482
Okay, let's start with
what we do know about Naomi.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.354
'She targeted
a rich, single man'

18:14.441 --> 18:15.529
with the purpose
of extorting him.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.270
- Right?
- Right.

18:17.357 --> 18:19.489
So if she's done it once
she's probably done it before.

18:19.576 --> 18:22.275
Van Pelt, check into every
dating service in the bay area.

18:22.362 --> 18:24.364
'See if they've had
any experience with Naomi.'

18:24.451 --> 18:25.408
'Maybe we can get
to her that way.'

18:25.495 --> 18:27.018
[Van Pelt]
'On it.'

18:31.632 --> 18:34.591
There are 11 matchmaking
services in the bay area

18:34.678 --> 18:37.551
four of which specifically cater
to high-end clients.

18:37.638 --> 18:39.205
- Did they know Naomi?
- No.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.468
And none have reported
any extortion claims

18:41.555 --> 18:43.731
but I got to thinking

18:43.818 --> 18:45.820
what if she's planning
to blackmail again?

18:45.907 --> 18:47.952
I checked with
the companies in the area

18:48.039 --> 18:50.955
and one is planning
a singles mixer tonight.

18:51.042 --> 18:53.523
On a hunch, I cross-checked
Naomi's profile

18:53.610 --> 18:55.656
from Symphony with
all the profiles of the women

18:55.743 --> 18:57.223
listed
as attending the event.

18:57.310 --> 19:00.965
I got a match, a woman named
Viktoria Shays.

19:01.052 --> 19:03.794
No photo, but several answers
she gave about herself

19:03.881 --> 19:05.883
are identical to Naomi's.

19:05.970 --> 19:09.017
- Is Rigsby here?
- Yeah, somewhere.

19:09.104 --> 19:10.932
Tell him to go home
and put on a nice suit.

19:11.019 --> 19:13.195
He's got plans tonight.

19:13.282 --> 19:16.416
- Alright.
- Have you seen my laptop?

19:16.503 --> 19:19.332
No.

19:19.419 --> 19:22.987
[Erica]
'Now, Sarah, what kind
of men are you interested in?'

19:23.074 --> 19:25.338
[Sarah]
'Wow, right to it, uh..'

19:27.905 --> 19:29.342
[Erica]
'Now, Patrick'

19:29.429 --> 19:30.995
'what kind of woman
are you looking for?'

19:31.082 --> 19:35.565
Quiet, rich blondes. Nosnoring.
That is a deal breaker.

19:35.652 --> 19:37.088
[Erica]
'How would your closest friends
describe you'

19:37.176 --> 19:39.221
'to someone
who doesn't know you?'

19:39.308 --> 19:41.528
Oh. Uh, well,
I think they..

19:43.921 --> 19:46.881
[Erica]
'Now, Patrick, what kind of
woman are you looking for?'

19:46.968 --> 19:50.101
Quiet, rich blondes. Nosnoring.
That is a deal breaker.

19:52.974 --> 19:55.150
[Erica]
'Now, Sarah, what kind
of men are you interested in?'

19:55.237 --> 19:56.325
[click]

19:56.412 --> 19:57.935
[Sarah]
'Wow, right to it..'

19:59.937 --> 20:02.157
So what do you think?

20:02.244 --> 20:04.203
- I think you look good.
- Thank you. Cho?

20:04.290 --> 20:05.813
I'm not answering
that question.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.903
Oh, come on, honestly,
just tell me what you think.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.732
- You look alright.
- Thanks.

20:11.819 --> 20:15.475
I think you look great.
Like you have money, a career.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.651
- A perfect target for Naomi.
- I don't know.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.696
- What if she doesn't go for it?
- She will.

20:19.783 --> 20:21.350
What if she doesn't go for me?

20:21.437 --> 20:22.743
There's gonna be
a lot of single guys there.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.701
For this to work she has
to be interested in me.

20:24.788 --> 20:28.531
- She will. Just be yourself.
- That's a terrible idea.

20:28.618 --> 20:30.098
Maybe I should
do an accent or something.

20:30.185 --> 20:31.839
I don't think
you need an accent.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.580
Hello, Rigsby.

20:33.667 --> 20:36.800
Wayne Rigsby from Sussex.

20:36.887 --> 20:38.802
Uh, pleasure to meet you.

20:38.889 --> 20:41.196
Cheerio.

20:41.283 --> 20:43.329
- How's that?
- Yeah, don't do the accent.

20:54.078 --> 20:56.777
Rigsby, you hear me?

20:56.864 --> 20:58.213
Loud and clear.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.609
[Lisbon]
'Van Pelt, you in position?'

21:02.696 --> 21:04.959
I'm here.

21:05.046 --> 21:07.527
Gentlemen,
can I have your attention?

21:07.614 --> 21:09.093
It's time for me to bring in

21:09.180 --> 21:11.618
the beautiful women
you'll be meeting tonight.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.750
Don't forget the ABC's.

21:13.837 --> 21:16.884
Attentiveness, boldness,
confidence.

21:16.971 --> 21:18.625
You'll do great.

21:21.149 --> 21:24.065
[indistinct chatter]

21:35.598 --> 21:38.862
Rigsby, the event hostess
ID'd Naomi.

21:38.949 --> 21:40.864
Excuse me. One moment.

21:40.951 --> 21:42.431
[clears throat]

21:43.867 --> 21:45.129
Okay, which one is she?

21:45.216 --> 21:47.828
The blonde
in the lavender sheath.

21:47.915 --> 21:49.699
The one in what now?

21:49.786 --> 21:51.788
The blonde
in the purple dress.

21:56.706 --> 21:59.187
Got it.
Are you sure it's her?

21:59.274 --> 22:02.930
No. Find out if she's got
a rose tattoo on her hip.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.410
Then we'll know for sure.

22:04.497 --> 22:05.846
I'm moving in.

22:10.546 --> 22:12.287
Hello, red.

22:14.289 --> 22:15.769
- Can I buy you a drink--
- I'm engaged.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.118
Well, it's never too late
for one last--

22:17.205 --> 22:18.554
Keep walking.

22:20.948 --> 22:22.123
Okay.

22:34.091 --> 22:35.789
Hi. I'm Wayne.

22:37.138 --> 22:38.487
I'm Viktoria.

22:38.574 --> 22:40.446
Nice to meet you.

22:43.753 --> 22:45.886
So what do you do, Wayne?

22:45.973 --> 22:49.498
I'm a businessman.
E-commerce, mainly.

22:49.585 --> 22:51.239
How's that going for you?

22:51.326 --> 22:53.067
It's working out
pretty well.

22:53.154 --> 22:56.375
I have
a very diverse portfolio.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.289
And I have a room upstairs.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.856
And you're very direct.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.336
Is that a problem?

23:01.423 --> 23:02.685
I'm trying to think
of a reason why it might be

23:02.772 --> 23:05.775
and I can't really think
of one right now.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.386
Let's go.

23:15.045 --> 23:17.396
- Are you nervous?
- Me? No.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.572
Yeah, maybe a little.

23:19.659 --> 23:22.226
Well, don't be.
I won't bite.

23:22.313 --> 23:25.665
Good. Me either.
No biting.

23:25.752 --> 23:27.797
316. My favorite number.

23:27.884 --> 23:29.625
316.

23:29.712 --> 23:33.629
Uh, just curious, uh,
do you have any tattoos?

23:33.716 --> 23:36.893
Um, why don't you come
and find out?

23:36.980 --> 23:38.155
Okay.

23:42.856 --> 23:44.335
So come in.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.382
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll be right out.

23:50.516 --> 23:51.647
Thanks.

24:01.178 --> 24:04.007
Guys? You hear me?

24:04.094 --> 24:06.532
She's in the bathroom.

24:10.405 --> 24:15.236
Wow. That is a, um,
very nice tattoo..

24:15.323 --> 24:17.456
...of a rose.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.066
It's a rose tattoo.

24:19.153 --> 24:20.328
Mm.

24:22.809 --> 24:25.159
Uh, maybe we should
have a drink first

24:25.246 --> 24:27.596
or, uh, you know, uh..

24:29.032 --> 24:31.687
...a snack.

24:31.774 --> 24:34.385
So would you call yourself
adventurous, Wayne?

24:34.473 --> 24:37.171
Adventurous?
Um, what, like skydiving?

24:37.258 --> 24:38.738
Mm, no.

24:46.572 --> 24:49.313
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.185
CBI.

24:51.272 --> 24:54.275
Uh, yeah, found the, uh, tattoo.
This is definitely the suspect.

24:54.362 --> 24:55.885
Nice work.

24:55.972 --> 24:57.887
Yeah. Your collar.

24:59.628 --> 25:01.674
Your arrest, Wayne.

25:01.761 --> 25:03.589
Oh, yeah.

25:03.676 --> 25:04.981
You're under arrest.

25:07.897 --> 25:09.508
Patrick.

25:09.595 --> 25:11.640
I'm surprised to see
you're back.

25:11.727 --> 25:13.947
Are you here to finish
your profile?

25:14.034 --> 25:16.950
No.
I saw something strange

25:17.037 --> 25:19.474
on the DVD you're using
as your alibi.

25:19.561 --> 25:22.129
So I came by
to test out a theory.

25:22.216 --> 25:24.653
So you're still trying to prove
I murdered my husband?

25:24.740 --> 25:27.917
- You're still worried I will?
- Come on in.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.620
Why don't you have a seat?

25:34.707 --> 25:36.665
You want to interview me? Why?

25:36.752 --> 25:38.754
Like I said,
I have a theory.

25:38.841 --> 25:41.975
- You scared?
- No.

25:42.062 --> 25:43.324
It might be good for me
to experience

25:43.411 --> 25:45.282
what my clients go through.

25:53.116 --> 25:54.944
You can ask questions
from in there, yes?

25:55.031 --> 25:57.512
- Yes.
- Thank you.

25:57.599 --> 25:59.470
What have you got
up your sleeve?

25:59.558 --> 26:00.689
Patience.

26:05.694 --> 26:08.175
Okay.

26:08.262 --> 26:10.438
- Can you hear me?
-Yes.

26:11.482 --> 26:14.050
Okay, Erica..

26:14.137 --> 26:16.618
...tell me, what kind of man
are you looking for?

26:16.705 --> 26:18.925
I'm not looking.
I'm mourning.

26:19.012 --> 26:23.364
Yes. Uh, please humor me.

26:23.451 --> 26:26.715
Someone kind
and generous.

26:26.802 --> 26:30.240
Someone patient.

26:30.327 --> 26:33.809
I'm sorry. I'm really not
comfortable talking about this.

26:38.771 --> 26:40.207
Patrick?

26:40.294 --> 26:41.600
[Erica on tape]
'How would your closest friends'

26:41.687 --> 26:43.166
'describe you to someone
who doesn't know you?'

26:43.253 --> 26:44.733
Patrick, what are you doing?

26:44.820 --> 26:46.039
[Erica on tape]
'How would you describe
yourself'

26:46.126 --> 26:47.388
'to someone
who doesn't know you?'

26:47.475 --> 26:50.434
What's going on in here?

26:50.521 --> 26:51.566
[recorder clicks]

26:51.653 --> 26:53.699
I'm proving my theory.

26:53.786 --> 26:55.657
I heard a strange sound
on the DVD

26:55.744 --> 26:59.139
you're using as your alibi,
a faint clicking noise.

26:59.226 --> 27:01.141
Almost mechanical.

27:01.228 --> 27:04.797
Then I figured out
what it was.

27:04.884 --> 27:06.537
[tape rewinds]

27:06.625 --> 27:08.583
[Erica on tape]
'How would you describe
yourself to..'

27:08.670 --> 27:10.977
A simple tape recorder

27:11.064 --> 27:12.631
just like this one.

27:12.718 --> 27:15.372
I knew you weren't here
for the interview.

27:15.459 --> 27:17.548
How could you be? You're off
killing your husband.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.464
But how do we explain
your voice on the DVD?

27:20.551 --> 27:22.031
This is ridiculous.

27:22.118 --> 27:24.207
Recording the interview
is easy.

27:24.294 --> 27:26.732
After all,
you've done hundreds of them.

27:26.819 --> 27:29.604
And once you had the recorder
in place, you had plenty of time

27:29.691 --> 27:32.041
to leave through that door,
kill your husband

27:32.128 --> 27:34.609
and come back here without
anyone noticing you're gone.

27:34.696 --> 27:36.219
'But there is one thing
you needed'

27:36.306 --> 27:39.440
in order
for your plan to work..

27:39.527 --> 27:40.963
...an accomplice.

27:41.050 --> 27:42.922
You needed someone to be here

27:43.009 --> 27:45.794
and to play the recorded
questions at the right time.

27:45.881 --> 27:49.493
That's the one loose end
you left untied.

27:49.580 --> 27:53.280
That explains it,
doesn't it?

27:53.367 --> 27:56.239
Of course, there's
just one problem.

28:03.029 --> 28:04.770
So if what you're saying
is true

28:04.857 --> 28:07.381
I walked out right past
my client

28:07.468 --> 28:09.426
in the middle
of her interview.

28:10.950 --> 28:14.693
Something she would have
mentioned, huh?

28:14.780 --> 28:17.521
I didn't kill my husband,
Patrick.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.524
I do understand.

28:20.611 --> 28:23.614
After all you've been through,
you see evil everywhere.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.399
I see you.

28:25.486 --> 28:27.270
Patrick.

28:27.357 --> 28:31.535
You are a kind, clever,
wonderful man.

28:31.622 --> 28:34.495
You have so much potential.

28:34.582 --> 28:37.716
But you have to stop
this obsessive behavior.

28:37.803 --> 28:41.284
You need to get a life.

28:41.371 --> 28:42.851
Goodnight, Erica.

28:45.201 --> 28:46.637
Goodnight, Patrick.

28:53.470 --> 28:55.124
[Lisbon]
'All you've proven is
that Erica Flynn'

28:55.211 --> 28:58.432
may have murdered her husband,
not that she did.

28:58.519 --> 29:00.521
Which is why I need to find
her accomplice.

29:00.608 --> 29:03.089
- If there is an accomplice.
- There's no if.

29:03.176 --> 29:06.179
Yes, there is. We've got other
viable suspects on this thing.

29:06.266 --> 29:08.747
- Like who?
- Like Naomi, for one.

29:08.834 --> 29:12.011
Naomi? She's a greedy
opportunist that hates men.

29:12.098 --> 29:13.360
She's not
a cold-blooded killer.

29:13.447 --> 29:16.319
We don't know that for sure.

29:16.406 --> 29:18.582
You always say
that the simplest answers

29:18.669 --> 29:20.889
usually are the most likely,
but it seems like

29:20.976 --> 29:23.413
you're coming up with more
and more elaborate scenarios

29:23.500 --> 29:24.980
just to prove
that you're right.

29:25.067 --> 29:27.548
Erica killed her husband.

29:27.635 --> 29:30.769
I am 100% sure of it.

29:31.552 --> 29:33.206
I don't get it.

29:33.293 --> 29:35.251
What is it about this woman?

29:35.338 --> 29:38.254
Why are you
so obsessed with her?

29:38.341 --> 29:41.257
Because she doesn't think
I'm smart enough to catch her.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.957
Oh, well,
that's a good reason.

29:45.044 --> 29:47.916
Healthy. Professional.

29:48.003 --> 29:50.963
Uh, just answer me
one more thing.

29:51.050 --> 29:53.574
Okay, if Erica Flynn
did murder her husband

29:53.661 --> 29:56.359
how did she leave the room
without her client noticing?

29:58.709 --> 30:01.016
That I don't know.

30:01.103 --> 30:03.845
But I'm working on it.

30:06.761 --> 30:08.807
You're going to jail, Naomi.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.417
'Nothing can prevent that
from happening'

30:10.504 --> 30:11.940
but you can help yourself
out here.

30:12.027 --> 30:13.289
Tell me what you know
about John Flynn.

30:13.376 --> 30:15.248
Nothing.
I've never even met him.

30:15.335 --> 30:19.252
Now we both know that's not
true. John Flynn ran Symphony.

30:19.339 --> 30:20.775
He found out you were
blackmailing his clients

30:20.862 --> 30:21.994
and confronted you, didn't he?

30:22.081 --> 30:23.691
I never blackmailed anyone.

30:23.778 --> 30:25.824
We have multiple victims
who claim otherwise.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.651
We have the video camera
you hid in your hotel room

30:27.738 --> 30:30.350
with other victims on it.

30:30.437 --> 30:32.308
You watched that tape?

30:34.049 --> 30:36.922
Did any of those guys
look like victims to you?

30:37.009 --> 30:40.273
They look like Johns being
conned by a clever prostitute.

30:40.360 --> 30:41.927
I'm not a prostitute.

30:42.014 --> 30:43.754
Where were you between
the hours of 5:00 and 6:00

30:43.842 --> 30:45.234
'the night of the murder?'

30:45.321 --> 30:46.670
I want my lawyer.

30:46.757 --> 30:48.411
I've nothing more to say to you.

30:48.498 --> 30:50.761
Okay.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.633
But we're waiting on a warrant
to search your apartment.

30:52.720 --> 30:55.201
You talk now,
we can make a deal.

30:55.288 --> 30:57.507
We find anything linking you
to the murder, all bets are off.

30:57.594 --> 30:58.769
Lawyer.

31:02.251 --> 31:04.166
Uh, yes, Erica interviewed me
from the AV room

31:04.253 --> 31:05.254
but she never left.

31:05.341 --> 31:06.865
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.823
She would've
had to walk right past me.

31:12.435 --> 31:13.784
What are you doing?

31:13.872 --> 31:15.177
During your interview,
do you remember

31:15.264 --> 31:16.744
how bright the lights were
in that room?

31:16.831 --> 31:17.832
Yes.

31:17.919 --> 31:18.877
Shining right in your face

31:18.964 --> 31:20.226
in fact.

31:20.313 --> 31:22.054
Well, I guess so.

31:22.141 --> 31:23.969
Yes,
I once had a job onstage.

31:24.056 --> 31:26.928
I'll never forget how bright
those lights could be.

31:27.015 --> 31:28.887
What does that have to do
with anything?

31:28.974 --> 31:31.715
I'll show you.
Keep your eye on your phone.

31:34.370 --> 31:36.242
What are you doing?

31:37.939 --> 31:40.594
It's gone.

31:40.681 --> 31:41.856
Precisely.

31:44.076 --> 31:45.860
Hey,
is that Sarah still here?

31:45.947 --> 31:47.383
Why?

31:47.470 --> 31:48.863
Just had a few,
uh, follow-up questions

31:48.950 --> 31:51.213
about the investigation.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.737
You're such a bad liar.
She left five minutes ago.

31:53.824 --> 31:55.522
Really?

31:55.609 --> 31:57.524
Just call her up and ask her
out. What's the big deal?

31:57.611 --> 32:00.309
I can't do that.
It's totally unprofessional.

32:00.396 --> 32:02.877
Unless she says yes.
I think she'd say yes.

32:02.964 --> 32:04.183
I mean, she asked me
if I was single.

32:04.270 --> 32:05.749
Why would she ask
if I was single

32:05.836 --> 32:07.751
unless she wanted me
to ask her out, right?

32:23.245 --> 32:26.118
Sarah, hi. It's, uh,
Wayne Rigsby from CBI.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.386
If you keep up
with these visits

32:33.473 --> 32:35.344
I'm gonna have to
start charging you.

32:35.431 --> 32:37.477
Oh, this will be the last one,
I assure you.

32:37.564 --> 32:39.522
Oh. Have you given up
on this nonsense

32:39.609 --> 32:40.828
about me killing my husband?

32:40.915 --> 32:43.744
Nope, not at all.
Not one little tiny bit.

32:43.831 --> 32:47.008
Well, then you must have cracked
the case. Please tell me.

32:47.095 --> 32:49.315
I'm curious to know who this
evil accomplice of mine is.

32:49.402 --> 32:51.708
Well, I came by it
rather easily, I must say

32:51.795 --> 32:55.277
after a-a friend got me
thinking on the right path.

32:55.364 --> 32:56.844
Which path is that?

32:56.931 --> 33:00.500
The simplest answer is
most likely the correct one

33:00.587 --> 33:03.068
which means
your accomplice is

33:03.155 --> 33:05.244
someone you can
easily manipulate.

33:05.331 --> 33:08.856
A man, which is obvious enough
given your physical attributes.

33:08.943 --> 33:11.293
- I'm really getting tired--
- I'm not finished.

33:11.380 --> 33:15.210
He's also young
and impressionable, weak

33:15.297 --> 33:18.561
but above all, someone you can
make fall in love with you

33:18.648 --> 33:21.347
and someone naive enough
to believe

33:21.434 --> 33:22.826
that you had fallen in love
with them.

33:22.913 --> 33:25.394
Guess who I'm thinking of.

33:25.481 --> 33:28.397
Yes, that's right.
Your assistant, Peter.

33:33.881 --> 33:36.971
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

33:37.058 --> 33:39.669
Ah, we'll find out
soon enough.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.586
What's going on?

33:43.673 --> 33:46.024
Mrs. Flynn, we'd like you to
come back to the office with us.

33:46.111 --> 33:50.593
- Answer a few questions.
- Of course. Anything to help.

33:57.557 --> 34:00.603
How long do you think it'll take
before he tells me everything?

34:01.561 --> 34:02.736
Hmm?

34:08.394 --> 34:10.135
How you holding up, Peter?

34:10.222 --> 34:12.833
I'm tired.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.096
Ah, not to worry.
You won't be here much longer.

34:15.183 --> 34:17.664
I know you're not gonna talk,
and I know why.

34:19.970 --> 34:21.972
You're in love with Erica.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.888
No, that's okay. You don't need
to deny it. I get it.

34:24.975 --> 34:27.674
She's beautiful, she's smart,
she's successful.

34:29.154 --> 34:30.764
Makes you wonder, though,
right?

34:30.851 --> 34:32.287
Wonder what?

34:33.897 --> 34:36.509
What she sees in you..

34:36.596 --> 34:38.772
...apart from her alibi.

34:38.859 --> 34:40.339
I mean, let's be honest here,
Peter.

34:40.426 --> 34:42.167
You don't really have
that much to offer her.

34:42.254 --> 34:44.343
- That's not true.
- So you are having an affair.

34:44.430 --> 34:47.650
- I-I did not say that.
- Right.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.348
We're being honest here,
Peter.

34:49.435 --> 34:53.003
Deep down, do you really think
that she loves you?

34:53.091 --> 34:54.396
Or are you
just kidding yourself

34:54.483 --> 34:56.050
because it feel so nice
to be with her?

34:56.137 --> 34:59.793
No. I love her,
and she loves me.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.925
She was using you.

35:02.012 --> 35:03.840
She made you
an accessory to murder.

35:03.927 --> 35:05.668
You're wrong.

35:05.755 --> 35:08.367
She got what she wanted from you
and now she is done with you.

35:08.454 --> 35:09.716
- Stop. Stop saying that.
- She doesn't love you, Peter.

35:09.803 --> 35:11.457
She never did.

35:11.544 --> 35:12.632
Now, tell me
what happened the night

35:12.719 --> 35:15.243
Erica murdered her husband.

35:15.330 --> 35:18.420
She probably told you
that he was abusing her, right?

35:18.507 --> 35:20.466
Smacking her around,
raping her?

35:20.553 --> 35:22.032
I don't care
what you say.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.687
I'm not gonna hurt Erica.

35:35.350 --> 35:37.744
What do we do now?

35:39.789 --> 35:40.964
Jane?

35:41.051 --> 35:42.662
Let him go.

35:53.586 --> 35:55.283
- Hi, Wayne.
- Oh, hey.

35:55.370 --> 35:56.806
Wow. You look amazing.

35:56.893 --> 36:00.288
Oh, thanks. So do you.

36:00.375 --> 36:02.943
- Oh, are you ready to go?
- Yeah.

36:07.904 --> 36:09.254
I was hoping you'd call me.

36:09.341 --> 36:13.083
- Yeah, I'm glad I did.
- Me, too.

36:17.914 --> 36:19.264
[elevator bell dings]

36:23.311 --> 36:25.487
[Erica]
'Hard at work, I see.'

36:25.574 --> 36:29.187
Mm.
What do you want?

36:29.274 --> 36:32.320
I'd like to thank you
for having me brought down here.

36:32.407 --> 36:35.149
That was very courteous
of you.

36:35.236 --> 36:36.803
Though I have to admit,
I was a little surprised

36:36.890 --> 36:39.719
your colleagues decided
to simply let me go

36:39.806 --> 36:42.852
you being so certain
of my guilt and all.

36:42.939 --> 36:46.987
Let me guess.
Peter didn't say a word to you.

36:47.074 --> 36:50.512
Maybe now you'll be able
to move past this nonsense.

36:50.599 --> 36:53.298
Let me tell you something,
I will catch you

36:53.385 --> 36:55.082
sooner or later.

36:55.169 --> 36:57.780
I promise you
that I will catch you.

36:57.867 --> 37:01.001
Please. If you were
capable of catching me

37:01.088 --> 37:03.264
you would have done so
by now.

37:06.789 --> 37:08.226
Goodbye, Patrick.

37:09.183 --> 37:11.229
Jane. Jane, we gotta go.

37:11.316 --> 37:13.840
'I just got a call
from SFPD. Peter's dead.'

37:15.842 --> 37:17.887
He killed himself.

37:31.684 --> 37:33.381
Sleeping pills.

37:33.468 --> 37:37.167
Coroner found an empty bottle
in the bathroom.

37:37.255 --> 37:40.693
So...sole accomplice
in your crime

37:40.780 --> 37:42.999
just went and killed himself.

37:44.784 --> 37:47.047
Fortunately, however..

37:47.134 --> 37:49.484
...Peter left a letter.

37:53.575 --> 37:57.057
And I'm betting it will tell us
everything we need to know

37:57.144 --> 37:59.102
about the night
your husband was murdered.

37:59.189 --> 38:02.062
You confess now,
chances are the AG's office

38:02.149 --> 38:04.151
is gonna cut you a deal.

38:10.418 --> 38:13.029
Open it.
I don't believe you.

38:16.642 --> 38:18.296
Be my guest.

38:25.607 --> 38:26.869
[scoffs]

38:26.956 --> 38:29.959
Yes, it's a bluff.

38:30.046 --> 38:32.484
Honestly,
I expected better from you.

38:32.571 --> 38:34.616
Using poor Peter's suicide
as a trap.

38:34.703 --> 38:37.445
That's low. Immoral, even.

38:37.532 --> 38:39.882
I tried to tell you.
I always win.

38:39.969 --> 38:43.625
You might have gotten away with
murder, but you didn't win.

38:43.712 --> 38:44.931
How's that exactly?

38:45.018 --> 38:47.499
No matter what you say,
I know the truth.

38:47.586 --> 38:49.805
You cared about Peter

38:49.892 --> 38:52.417
and it was your actions
that drove him to kill himself.

38:52.504 --> 38:54.114
That is something
that you will live with

38:54.201 --> 38:57.944
for the rest of your life.

38:58.031 --> 39:00.163
- I'll manage.
- No, you won't.

39:00.250 --> 39:02.427
It'll eat you up
from the inside

39:02.514 --> 39:05.038
because you cared
way too much about him.

39:05.125 --> 39:07.214
- You're wrong.
- No, I'm right.

39:07.301 --> 39:09.216
Just like I'm right about
the first time I saw you.

39:09.303 --> 39:13.873
You are an open book to me.
You're transparent, like glass.

39:13.960 --> 39:17.050
If you think for a moment I even
remotely cared about Peter

39:17.137 --> 39:18.356
you're as gullible as he was.

39:18.443 --> 39:19.835
Not just cared. You loved him.
I know it.

39:19.922 --> 39:21.794
Can't you see? There's nothing
you can hide from me.

39:21.881 --> 39:24.579
- You're a fool.
- And you're a terrible liar.

39:24.666 --> 39:27.103
You lost, Erica,
not just some little game.

39:27.190 --> 39:28.583
You lost someone you loved.

39:28.670 --> 39:30.585
I didn't love Peter.
I could care less about him.

39:30.672 --> 39:32.718
He meant nothing to me.

39:32.805 --> 39:35.024
Perfect. That's exactly
what I was hoping to hear.

39:35.111 --> 39:37.679
Rather that's exactly what
I was hoping Peter would hear.

39:37.766 --> 39:38.941
Peter.

39:43.337 --> 39:44.469
Peter.

39:46.993 --> 39:49.125
Thank God you're here.

39:49.212 --> 39:51.693
Don't listen to a word they say.
They're telling you lies.

39:51.780 --> 39:54.783
You know how I feel about you,
darling.

39:54.870 --> 39:56.394
Peter. Peter!

39:56.481 --> 39:58.439
Please!

39:58.526 --> 40:00.136
By the way, there was
a body in that bag.

40:00.223 --> 40:02.182
'It wasn't Peter's.
No, of course not.'

40:02.269 --> 40:05.315
That's kind of obvious.
It was your husband's.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.231
And I told you
I would catch you.

40:08.318 --> 40:10.146
And I did.

40:12.148 --> 40:15.630
Erica left ten minutes
into the interview.

40:15.717 --> 40:19.982
She told me to wait behind
with the recorder.

40:20.069 --> 40:22.985
'She said if I just played
the questions'

40:23.072 --> 40:26.728
'then no one would ever know
she was gone.'

40:28.948 --> 40:32.168
She knew John was going down
to the marina after work.

40:32.255 --> 40:33.735
That time of day

40:33.822 --> 40:37.435
there aren't a lot of people
around, you know?

40:37.522 --> 40:39.741
'She waited for him and..'

40:42.788 --> 40:44.093
[gunshots through silencer]

40:46.574 --> 40:48.794
[Jane]
'And you shot him.'

40:51.797 --> 40:55.409
You shot your own husband
in cold blood.

40:55.496 --> 40:58.020
Peter told us everything.

40:58.107 --> 41:01.328
You used him as your accomplice
because he was weak..

41:01.415 --> 41:03.461
...unstable.

41:03.548 --> 41:05.985
You could manipulate him,
but it backfired.

41:06.072 --> 41:07.465
'He couldn't take the pressure'

41:07.552 --> 41:08.988
and now he'll testify
against you

41:09.075 --> 41:12.557
and you will spend
a very long time in prison.

41:12.644 --> 41:15.429
Don't count on it.

41:15.516 --> 41:17.779
It's over.

41:17.866 --> 41:19.955
A jury still
has to believe him.

41:21.566 --> 41:25.483
And he is, as you so accurately
put it, unstable.

41:25.570 --> 41:29.095
Erica, it's over.

41:29.182 --> 41:31.140
I'm sure of it.

41:31.227 --> 41:33.665
Don't be.

41:33.752 --> 41:36.102
Not everyone's
as smart as you.

41:37.582 --> 41:38.974
[Lisbon]
'Jane?'

41:39.061 --> 41:40.889
[door rattles]

41:40.976 --> 41:42.978
You in here?

41:46.373 --> 41:48.810
Ah, there's my laptop.

42:01.693 --> 42:03.172
Uh, I'm looking for someone

42:03.259 --> 42:06.524
who, uh..

42:06.611 --> 42:10.397
'...someone...I can trust'

42:10.484 --> 42:13.618
someone strong,
someone..

42:13.705 --> 42:15.924
...at peace with themselves.

42:16.011 --> 42:18.579
Someone better than me.

42:18.666 --> 42:21.974
Someone who knows the..

42:22.061 --> 42:24.411
...worst side of me
and still loves me.

42:27.849 --> 42:31.287
[Erica]
'Sounds like
an amazing woman.'

42:31.374 --> 42:32.811
She was.

42:36.945 --> 42:39.469
[Jane]
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

42:42.647 --> 42:44.431
[theme music]
