worthy of entering my temple...

02:17.679 --> 02:21.224
Olmec, tell us more
about their mission.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.226

02:23.268 --> 02:25.812
the jealous, passionate
Hawaiian goddess

02:25.854 --> 02:28.148
of fire and volcanos.

02:28.189 --> 02:32.235
As a young goddess not yet
in control of her powers,

02:32.277 --> 02:35.196
Pele impetuously sleeps
with her older sister's husband

02:35.238 --> 02:38.116
and then accidentally burns down

02:38.158 --> 02:41.369
most of their home island
of Tahiti.

02:41.411 --> 02:45.456
She flees her sister's wrath
in a sailing canoe,

02:45.498 --> 02:48.585
taking with her an egg
kept warm in her armpit

02:48.626 --> 02:49.919
that will soon become

02:49.961 --> 02:53.715
her favorite younger sister,
Hi'iaka.

02:53.756 --> 02:58.887
They traveled 2,600 miles to
the Hawaiian island of Kauai,

02:58.928 --> 03:01.598
where she creates a volcano
by stabbing the ground

03:01.639 --> 03:05.226
with her digging stick,
but her angered older sister,

03:05.268 --> 03:06.978
goddess of the sea,

03:07.020 --> 03:11.649
immediately extinguishes it
with a giant wave.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.985
So Pele flees south,
starting volcanos

03:14.027 --> 03:18.489
on Oahu, Molokai, Lanai,
and Maui,

03:18.531 --> 03:22.744
all snuffed out
by her revenge-filled sibling.

03:22.785 --> 03:26.039
She finally lands
on the Big Island of Hawaii,

03:26.080 --> 03:28.499
where she makes her home
in a volcano

03:28.541 --> 03:31.628
on top of the tallest mountain
on earth, Mauna Loa,

03:31.669 --> 03:34.297
too high for her sister
to flood it.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.882
But in the process,

03:35.924 --> 03:41.012
she has created
the Hawaiian Island chain.

All in all, we've done
five marathons to date.

we encourage each other.

DANNY: It has been a very hard
year. I haven't worked.

FIONA: I went through
a really hard breakup,

04:05.036 --> 04:07.080
and this would just be something

04:07.121 --> 04:09.582

my self-confidence.

worthy of entering your temple.

swim out, ignite your volcano,

04:38.319 --> 04:41.948
showing the six islands
Pele visited.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.826
Help your teammate
find the first island

04:44.867 --> 04:47.370
so they can swim it to
the other side of your volcano

04:47.412 --> 04:49.872
and clip it
into the correct position.

04:49.914 --> 04:54.085
Switch places until you have
built the island chain.

04:54.127 --> 04:58.131
Then dig in that volcanic soil
to find and read a poem

04:58.172 --> 05:00.967
honoring Pele
before you exit the moat.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.219

09:56.846 --> 09:58.431
Still pretty cool.

09:58.472 --> 10:00.224
- Thank you so much, Red Jaguars.
- Thank you for having us.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.810
- We appreciate it.
- Thank you.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.062
Moving on to the next round
and one step closer

10:05.104 --> 10:08.899
to the temple run
and $25,000 are

10:08.941 --> 10:12.111
the Green Monkeys,
the Blue Barracudas,

10:12.153 --> 10:13.779
and the Silver Snakes.

10:13.821 --> 10:16.490
When we come back, they're
gonna show us how smart they are

10:16.532 --> 10:20.328
in the Steps of Knowledge
right after this. Stay tuned.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.960
Welcome back to
"Legends of the Hidden Temple."

10:28.002 --> 10:32.798
Hey, teams, how you guys doing?!
Oh, yes!

10:32.840 --> 10:34.091
Blue Barracudas, you were
the first team across the moat.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.426
That's right.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.219
You think you're ready
for this level?

10:37.261 --> 10:39.096
I think we were born
ready for this.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.723
Okay, Blue Barracudas,
I see you.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.224
We still need to focus again

10:42.266 --> 10:43.184
'cause the next challenge
is different.

10:43.225 --> 10:44.685
It's completely different.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.521
Now this round,
you gotta listen carefully

10:47.563 --> 10:49.482
because Olmec is going to
give you the origin story

10:49.523 --> 10:51.442
of the fiery lava rock of Pele.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.362
Olmec?

10:54.403 --> 10:57.239
We left Pele hiding out
on Hawaii,

10:57.281 --> 11:00.409
safe from
her older sister's wrath.

11:00.451 --> 11:04.372
She dances hula with her
favorite younger sister Hi'iaka

11:04.413 --> 11:07.500
and Hi'iaka's best friend Hopoe.

11:07.541 --> 11:10.836
Thirsting for companionship,
Pele dreams of love.

11:10.878 --> 11:13.172
Her spirit travels to Kauai,

11:13.214 --> 11:17.468
where she discovers
a young chief named Lohi'au.

11:17.510 --> 11:22.348
The young lovers hula and chill
until Pele's lust is quenched.

11:22.390 --> 11:26.018
Without notice, her spirit
returns to Mauna Loa,

11:26.060 --> 11:27.937
leaving Lohi'au despondent.

11:27.978 --> 11:31.065
Weeks later,
Pele grows lonely again

11:31.107 --> 11:34.068
and commands Hi'iaka
to go to Kauai

11:34.110 --> 11:36.529
and bring Lohi'au to her
at once.

11:36.570 --> 11:38.906
She warns her sister
that he's handsome

11:38.948 --> 11:40.700
and to keep her hands off.

11:40.741 --> 11:43.160
Hi'iaka will keep her hands
to herself,

11:43.202 --> 11:45.705
but she demands Pele
keep her lava in check

11:45.746 --> 11:48.374
and protect
her best friend Hopoe.

11:48.416 --> 11:52.211
On Kauai,
Hi'iaka finds Lohi'au dead.

11:52.253 --> 11:55.589
Pele's sudden disappearance
broke his heart.

11:55.631 --> 11:57.341
To make her sister happy,

11:57.383 --> 12:01.512
Hi'iaka magically brings
Lohi'au back to life,

12:01.554 --> 12:04.598
and he agrees to go with her
to see Pele.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.977
40 days pass, and Pele's
suspicion gets the best of her.

12:08.018 --> 12:10.980
Convinced Lohi'au seduced
her sister,

12:11.021 --> 12:14.483
Pele flies into a fit of rage

12:14.525 --> 12:17.278
and sends an explosion of lava
into the sky,

12:17.319 --> 12:21.907
killing Hi'iaka's best friend
Hopoe, encasing her in lava,

12:21.949 --> 12:26.245
and swamping the entire island.

12:26.287 --> 12:31.375
This is a story about sisters.
I mean, sisters, hello.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.377
Family turmoil. This is--
This is our thing.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.671
This is our bag, baby.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.715
Pele--she is a creator.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.842
I definitely relate to Pele
in that sense.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.761
Little nicer than her,
I promise.

12:41.802 --> 12:43.053
- [laughs]
- But, um...

12:43.095 --> 12:44.722
But she's showing
her true colors

12:44.764 --> 12:48.392
and, like,
really owning who she is,

12:48.434 --> 12:50.561
and I think
that's who Abby and I are.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.856
You are on
the Steps of Knowledge,

12:53.898 --> 12:55.691
and Olmec is about
to ask you questions

12:55.733 --> 12:58.235
about the legend you just heard.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.654
He'll also ask
general knowledge questions

13:00.696 --> 13:02.573
related to the story.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.701
Once he's done asking
the questions,

13:05.743 --> 13:07.036
stomp on the ancient marks
in front of you.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.205
If correct, take a step down.

13:09.246 --> 13:12.374
If you're wrong,
or you take too long to answer,

13:12.416 --> 13:14.627
the other teams have a chance
to answer.

13:14.668 --> 13:16.337
The first two teams to get
to the bottom

13:16.378 --> 13:18.380
will move on to the next level.

13:18.422 --> 13:21.759
The last one will be out.
Ready?

13:21.801 --> 13:23.761
Ready.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.347
Olmec, first question, please.

13:26.388 --> 13:30.100
What is Hi'iaka's relation
to Pele?

13:30.142 --> 13:31.268
[bell rattles]

13:31.310 --> 13:33.604
CRISTELA:
Oh, Green Monkeys.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.189
Her sister.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.565
That is correct.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.942
- CRISTELA: Oh, Green Monkeys.
- Yes! Whoo!

13:37.983 --> 13:40.569
Take a step down, please.
Off to a good start.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.363
Olmec, next question.

13:42.404 --> 13:46.909
On Kauai, what position
is held by Lohi'au?

13:46.951 --> 13:48.577
- [bell rattles]
- CRISTELA: Silver Snakes?

13:48.619 --> 13:50.412
- Chief?
- OLMEC: That is correct.

13:50.454 --> 13:52.289
- Whoo!
- CRISTELA: Ooh, Silver Snakes.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.084
Tied with Green Monkeys.
All right.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.002
Olmec, next question.

13:57.044 --> 14:00.297
From which island,
now part of French Polynesia,

14:00.339 --> 14:02.299
did Pele come?

14:02.341 --> 14:03.717
- [bell rattles]
- Oh! Blue Barracudas.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.512
BOTH: Tahiti.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.055
You are correct.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.431
CRISTELA:
Ohh! What a great start.

14:09.473 --> 14:11.725
Neck and neck and neck.
I love it. I can't wait.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.602
Olmec, next question, please.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.105
According to our version
of the story,

14:16.146 --> 14:18.524
after dancing with Lohi'au,

14:18.566 --> 14:21.944
Pele's spirit returns
to what active volcano?

14:21.986 --> 14:24.321
- [bell rattles]
- Oh, Green Monkeys.

14:24.363 --> 14:27.157
Uh, Mount Kilauea.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.826
OLMEC: Incorrect.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.452
- [bell rattles]
- Blue Barracudas?

14:30.494 --> 14:33.539
Mauna Loa.

14:33.581 --> 14:34.999
- OLMEC: That is correct.
- [cheering]

14:35.040 --> 14:37.626
CRISTELA: Oh! Blue Barracudas,
you are one step away

14:37.668 --> 14:39.837
from moving on
to the next level.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.630
The Blue Barracudas
being in the lead

14:41.672 --> 14:42.965
is definitely not an obstacle.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.634
- We're in it to win it.
- Step your game up.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.094
CRISTELA:
Olmec, next question.

14:47.136 --> 14:51.307
What is the name of molten rock
still underground?

14:51.348 --> 14:52.808
- [bell rattles]
- Green Monkeys?

14:52.850 --> 14:55.102
Lava.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.187
OLMEC: Incorrect.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.188
[bell rattles]

14:58.230 --> 14:59.148
Silver Snakes.

14:59.189 --> 15:01.442
Lava?

15:01.483 --> 15:03.235
Incorrect.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.029
He just said lava.
You can't say lava again.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.655
[bell rattles]

15:06.697 --> 15:09.325
- Blue Barracudas?
- Magma.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.285
- That is correct!
- Yeah!

15:11.327 --> 15:12.703
- [laughter]
- Whoo!

15:12.745 --> 15:15.205
Blue Barracudas become
the first team to move on

15:15.247 --> 15:16.749
to the next level.
- Whoo!

15:16.790 --> 15:19.084
Ahh! You... up.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.086
There is really no tough love
for us.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.422
- Our tough love is just love.
- [laughter]

15:23.464 --> 15:24.840
You're moving on
to the Temple Games.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.133
- Yeah, baby!
- Awesome!

15:26.175 --> 15:27.635
But still, we got one spot left.

15:27.676 --> 15:29.595
Green Monkey, Silver Snakes,
neck and neck.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.513
Olmec, next question, please.

15:31.555 --> 15:35.517
Also called "The Garden Isle,"

15:35.559 --> 15:38.270
which Hawaiian island
is the oldest?

15:38.312 --> 15:39.772
- [bell rattles]
- Green Monkeys.

15:39.813 --> 15:40.856
Kauai.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.192
OLMEC: That is correct.

15:43.233 --> 15:46.236
Oh, one step down.
You're one step away.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.906
Yes! That got me so juiced,
so pumped,

15:48.948 --> 15:50.908
because I thought
that was maybe right,

15:50.950 --> 15:52.201
but I was just kind of guessing
a little bit.

15:52.242 --> 15:54.453
CRISTELA:
Olmec, next question.

15:54.495 --> 16:00.250
Which of these is the name
of Hi'iaka's best friend--

16:00.292 --> 16:04.046
Hopoe, Hope, Hopeless,
or Hopeful?

16:04.088 --> 16:05.589
- [bell rattles]
- Silver Snakes.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.383
Hopoe.

16:07.424 --> 16:08.926
- OLMEC: That is correct.
- [cheering]

16:08.968 --> 16:10.678
- Yes!
- Yes!

16:10.719 --> 16:13.597
Oh! The tension.
You're both one question away

16:13.639 --> 16:15.307
from moving on
to the Temple Games.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.892
Who will it be?

16:16.934 --> 16:18.310
Our strategy is Wade jumping in

16:18.352 --> 16:21.021
and hitting that buzzer
as fast as he can.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.940
Olmec, next question, please.

16:22.982 --> 16:26.610
How many days is Hi'iaka gone

16:26.652 --> 16:29.488
before Pele floods the grove
with lava?

16:29.530 --> 16:30.864
[bell rattles]

16:30.906 --> 16:32.324
- Green Monkeys.
- 40 days.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.703
- OLMEC: That is correct.
- [cheering]

16:35.744 --> 16:40.374
Oh! Green Monkeys, you are
going to the Temple Games.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.209
Congratulations.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.920
Ohh! That was a huge leap.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.798
Silver Snakes, unfortunately,
that means that you're out.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.091
Silver Snakes--
We gave it our best shot.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.176
Unfortunately,
we gotta slither home.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.595
I'm so sorry, but you're not
going home empty-handed.

16:53.637 --> 16:55.222
Tell 'em what they won.

16:55.264 --> 16:55.931
ANNOUNCER: On top
of your Silver Snakes shirts,

16:55.973 --> 16:56.682
you're going home
with a whole bunch of

16:56.724 --> 17:01.562
"Legends of the Hidden Temple"
signature swag,

17:01.603 --> 17:03.063
including limited edition hats,

17:03.105 --> 17:05.315
beach towels, sports chairs,
Spikeball sets,

17:05.357 --> 17:10.487
and giant Olmec party coolers
for each of you.

17:10.529 --> 17:11.822
CRISTELA: The Blue Barracudas
and Green Monkeys

17:11.864 --> 17:13.365
are one step closer

17:13.407 --> 17:16.785
to racing through Olmec's temple
for $25,000.

17:16.827 --> 17:20.122
Coming up next, we'll go head
to head in the Temple Games.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.540
Stay tuned. [laughs]

17:21.582 --> 17:23.500
Whoo!

17:23.542 --> 17:25.878
♪♪♪

17:28.005 --> 17:29.465
♪♪♪

17:29.506 --> 17:31.467
[cheering]

17:31.508 --> 17:33.552
- [laughs] Oh, yes.
- Whoo!

17:33.594 --> 17:36.305
Welcome back to
"Legends of the Hidden Temple."

17:36.346 --> 17:38.057
You've seen our heroes
cross Olmec's moat

17:38.098 --> 17:40.142
and make their way down
the Steps of Knowledge.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.352
Now the only thing
standing between them

17:42.394 --> 17:46.648
and a shot of $25,000
are these Temple Games.

17:46.690 --> 17:49.109
Still with us, we've got
Fiona and Daniel,

17:49.151 --> 17:51.361
the Blue Barracudas.
- Whoo!

17:51.403 --> 17:53.447
I'm feeling pumped,
but I'm also feeling exhausted.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.074
We've already done
a lot of physical activity

17:55.115 --> 17:57.409
and a lot of brain activity.

17:57.451 --> 18:00.370
I also think we've got
some tough competition.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.664
And Green Monkeys over here--
We've got Wade and Abby.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.875
You know what
monkeys' favorite food is?

18:04.917 --> 18:09.379
Fish guts! Yeah! Come on!

18:09.421 --> 18:14.551
Both teams are competing
for these Pendants of Life.

18:14.593 --> 18:17.846
- Ohh!
- Yeah!

18:17.888 --> 18:19.640
They will need them
to protect themselves

18:19.681 --> 18:22.768
from the dreaded temple guards
as they make their way

18:22.810 --> 18:24.353
through Olmec's temple.

18:24.394 --> 18:26.563
The first team to get
two Pendants of Life

18:26.605 --> 18:28.398
have proven themselves worthy

18:28.440 --> 18:31.693
and will be allowed to enter
Olmec's temple.

18:31.735 --> 18:35.030
Temple Game number one is going
to be played one team at a time.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.323
Blue Barracudas, you won
the Steps of Knowledge,

18:36.365 --> 18:39.284
and you've chosen to go second.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.286
- Second, yes.
- All right, well, that means,

18:41.328 --> 18:42.955
Green Monkeys,
go and get ready...

18:42.996 --> 18:44.623
Let's get it! Whoo!

18:44.665 --> 18:48.168
as Olmec tells us more
about Temple Game number one.

18:48.210 --> 18:53.215
In a fit of jealousy,
Pele lets her fiery lava flow,

18:53.257 --> 18:55.509
flooding the island and encasing

18:55.551 --> 18:59.179
her sister's best friend Hopoe
in lava rock.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.598
In this game,
you are the raging Pele.

19:01.640 --> 19:05.686
When Cristela gives the signal,
one of you race up the volcano,

19:05.727 --> 19:07.271
grab those smoldering rocks,

19:07.312 --> 19:11.358
and let the lava flow
to your teammate below.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.444
Your partner must catch it
in that lava bucket

19:14.486 --> 19:15.821
and flood the island.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.031
If any part of the island is
left standing,

19:18.073 --> 19:20.826
repeat the action
until it falls.

19:20.868 --> 19:23.620
Then switch positions.
Keep going

run over and hit your gong

19:33.046 --> 19:35.424

the six islands

wins.
