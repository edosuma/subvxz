WEBVTT

00:10.810 --> 00:12.937
That's one planet
that never showed up

00:13.013 --> 00:14.640
on the multiple choice exam.

00:14.714 --> 00:17.114
lts gravimetric readings
are similar

00:17.183 --> 00:19.447
to that
of a collapsed dwarf star.

00:19.519 --> 00:22.249
lt also resembles a quasar

00:22.322 --> 00:24.313
in that it has a high rate
of rotation- -

00:24.391 --> 00:26.450
approximately 58 revolutions
per minute.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.891
Shall we take a closer look?

00:27.961 --> 00:29.394
That's what we're here for.

00:29.462 --> 00:30.429
Tom,

00:30.497 --> 00:31.794
put us in a high orbit.

00:31.865 --> 00:32.991
Aye.

00:40.073 --> 00:41.472
Our warp drive

00:41.541 --> 00:42.599
is off- line.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.641
Why?

00:43.710 --> 00:45.678
Unknown.

00:45.745 --> 00:47.007
Back us off.

00:47.147 --> 00:49.308
Our impulse engines
aren't responding.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.282
Then use
the auxiliary thrusters.

00:53.019 --> 00:55.544
We're in some kind
of gravimetric gradient.

00:55.622 --> 00:57.681
lt's pulling us
toward the planet.

03:36.783 --> 03:39.411
The new one
is brighter than Tahal

03:39.485 --> 03:42.113
or any of his brothers
in the sky.

03:42.188 --> 03:43.951
What does he want from us?

03:44.090 --> 03:47.856
To answer that, we must learn
the nature of this god.

03:47.927 --> 03:50.760
We must understand
the reason for his arrival.

03:52.465 --> 03:54.956
You were making
an offering to Tahal.

03:55.134 --> 03:58.001
l placed the fire- fruit
on his altar.

03:58.104 --> 04:00.004
Then the ground shook.

04:00.039 --> 04:03.270
l looked up...
and the new one was there.

04:05.411 --> 04:07.538
The fire- fruit- - where is it?

04:17.523 --> 04:20.390
The new one doesn't want Tahal

04:20.459 --> 04:21.892
to have the fire- fruit.

04:22.028 --> 04:26.658
Make an altar for him...
as big as Tahal's.

04:26.733 --> 04:30.362
The fire- fruit
is only for the new one.

04:30.470 --> 04:32.335
No more for the people!

04:32.405 --> 04:34.498
lt is his alone.

04:36.509 --> 04:38.943
Ground Shaker...

04:39.045 --> 04:41.377
Light Bringer...

04:41.447 --> 04:44.348
take this today and every day!

04:44.417 --> 04:46.715
Accept our offering!

04:46.786 --> 04:48.947
Do not harm us.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.960
Report.

04:55.061 --> 04:56.358
We're in synchronous orbit

04:56.429 --> 04:58.488
57,000 kilometers
above the planet's equator.

04:58.564 --> 04:59.826
Good work, Tom. Now let's see...

04:59.899 --> 05:01.924
You're patting the wrong guy
on the back.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.026
Explain.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.968
Our thrusters went off- line

05:06.039 --> 05:07.438
halfway through our descent,

05:07.507 --> 05:08.769
and then we just stopped,

05:08.841 --> 05:10.399
like we were caught
in something.

05:10.510 --> 05:13.104
l'm picking up a strong
tachyon field along the hull.

05:13.179 --> 05:14.771
lt could be
what's holding us.

05:14.847 --> 05:16.371
Seven of Nine to the Bridge.

05:16.449 --> 05:17.507
Go ahead, Seven.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.676
Please report to Astrometrics.

05:19.752 --> 05:21.481
- There's something you must see.
- On my way.

05:21.554 --> 05:23.181
Chakotay.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.793
This planet has a tachyon core.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.885
lt's produced a subspace
particle field

05:29.962 --> 05:31.657
which runs between the poles.

05:31.731 --> 05:33.858
Voyager's arrival
disrupted that field.

05:33.933 --> 05:35.696
lt looks like
the ship's been caught

05:35.802 --> 05:37.201
in an eddy of some kind.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.067
lt's worse than that.

05:39.138 --> 05:41.072
Voyager seems to have become

05:41.140 --> 05:42.630
the planet's third pole.

05:42.742 --> 05:45.802
The imbalance is affecting
the outer crust.

05:45.878 --> 05:49.336
l've picked up indications of
high- frequency seismic activity.

05:49.415 --> 05:50.347
Caused by our presence?

05:50.416 --> 05:51.542
Possibly.

05:51.617 --> 05:54.347
Does anybody live down there?

05:54.420 --> 05:57.082
The atmosphere is having
a scattering effect

05:57.156 --> 05:58.418
on our sensors.

05:58.491 --> 05:59.651
ls that vegetation?

05:59.726 --> 06:01.455
According to sensors, yes.

06:01.561 --> 06:04.359
The tachyon core has created
a space- time differential

06:04.397 --> 06:06.763
between the planet
and the surrounding space.

06:06.833 --> 06:11.099
We're watching the seasons
change in a matter of seconds.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.069
For each second
that passes on Voyager,

06:13.139 --> 06:14.868
nearly a day goes by
on the planet.

06:14.974 --> 06:18.205
Scan for inhabitants.

06:18.277 --> 06:20.677
l can't isolate
individual life- forms.

06:20.747 --> 06:23.648
lt'll take time to correct
for the space- time differential.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.149
A couple of hundred

06:25.218 --> 06:26.207
years, maybe?

06:26.285 --> 06:28.549
lf our orbit starts to decay,

06:28.621 --> 06:30.987
Voyager will begin to feel
the effects of the differential,

06:31.057 --> 06:32.752
and we'll begin aging

06:32.825 --> 06:35.350
hundreds of times faster
than we would in normal space.

06:35.428 --> 06:38.363
Unless we want to live our lives
in the blink of an eye,

06:38.431 --> 06:40.729
l suggest we find
a way out of here.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.402
How's our warp core?

06:46.472 --> 06:48.940
The matter/antimatter reaction
is still active,

06:49.008 --> 06:50.908
but this field we're stuck in

06:50.977 --> 06:52.842
is raising hell
with the nacelles.

06:52.912 --> 06:55.380
Until we break orbit,
warp drive is off- line.

06:55.448 --> 06:58.383
And without warp drive,
we'll never leave orbit.

06:58.451 --> 07:00.248
lt does pose a
bit of a problem,

07:00.319 --> 07:01.513
doesn't it?

07:01.587 --> 07:04.078
Maybe the key is to learn
more about this planet,

07:04.157 --> 07:05.784
in case we're
missing something.

07:05.858 --> 07:08.622
The sensors aren't having
an easy time of it, either.

07:08.694 --> 07:09.820
Then let's modify

07:09.929 --> 07:11.988
a class- 5 probe
for low orbit.

07:12.064 --> 07:14.794
See what we can pick up.

07:14.867 --> 07:16.357
Configure the program

07:16.436 --> 07:19.405
to scan along all subspace
bands, and set it

07:19.472 --> 07:21.201
for visual images
every ten milliseconds.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.208
Snapshots.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.868
Why do l get the feeling

07:24.944 --> 07:27.572
you're not just interested
in tachyon fields?

07:27.647 --> 07:29.842
This could be the greatest
anthropological find

07:29.916 --> 07:31.178
of my career.

07:31.250 --> 07:33.241
lf there's an intelligent
species down there,

07:33.319 --> 07:35.253
we'll be able to track
their development- -

07:35.321 --> 07:37.448
not just for days or weeks,
but for centuries.

07:37.523 --> 07:39.150
Watch them discover
new and better ways

07:39.225 --> 07:40.715
of beating each other
over the head.

07:40.793 --> 07:44.160
They won't necessarily
follow the Klingon model.

07:44.230 --> 07:46.255
As opposed to the human model?

07:46.332 --> 07:47.731
lt'll take a few hours

07:47.800 --> 07:49.267
to make the adjustments.

07:49.335 --> 07:50.666
A few hours.

07:50.770 --> 07:53.466
We might miss the rise
and fall of a civilization.

07:53.573 --> 07:56.269
So we'll watch the next one.

08:20.533 --> 08:23.058
Oh. Oh, Protector.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.602
You're late.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.638
Well, the hill is steep,
and l...

08:26.706 --> 08:28.674
l'm not as young
as l used to be.

08:28.741 --> 08:30.606
More heat.

08:30.676 --> 08:31.608
Yes, Protector.

08:31.677 --> 08:32.701
There are grave matters

08:32.778 --> 08:34.871
of state here that
cannot be delayed.

08:34.947 --> 08:37.677
Oh, Protector,
what exactly are you doing?

08:37.750 --> 08:40.344
l'm sending him a letter.

08:40.419 --> 08:42.010
Him?

08:42.087 --> 08:44.682
S- S- Sending who a letter?

08:44.757 --> 08:46.691
The Ground Shaker.

08:46.759 --> 08:49.694
The Light Bringer.

08:49.762 --> 08:52.060
Well, had you been
more attentive to my lessons

08:52.131 --> 08:54.565
when you were a boy,
you would not be so gullible

08:54.634 --> 08:55.896
as a man.

08:56.002 --> 08:58.163
On the contrary- - 
you taught me well.

08:58.271 --> 09:01.604
Our ignorant ancestors believed
every star was a deity.

09:01.674 --> 09:03.801
You taught me
how foolish that was.

09:03.910 --> 09:06.310
Superstition, you called it.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.643
And that's exactly what it is.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.720
Hungry?

09:15.788 --> 09:19.986
Well, it's, uh, bad fortune
to eat the fire- fruit.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.822
According to whom?

09:21.928 --> 09:23.691
Our ancestors?

09:23.763 --> 09:26.527
Don't tell me you believe
that old superstition.

09:28.301 --> 09:31.702
Perhaps we shouldn't completely
ignore the old beliefs,

09:31.771 --> 09:35.207
no matter how strange
they may seem today.

09:35.274 --> 09:36.707
Ground Shaker...

09:36.776 --> 09:38.676
Ground... Shaker.

09:38.744 --> 09:42.111
lsn't it possible the name
was not given arbitrarily?

09:42.181 --> 09:44.411
That this star
is indeed responsible

09:44.483 --> 09:46.212
for knocking down our walls

09:46.285 --> 09:48.344
and making us stumble
as we walk?

09:48.421 --> 09:51.015
Oh, yes, l heard about that- - 
my condolences.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.421
You heard what?

09:52.491 --> 09:53.651
Well, that you stumbled

09:53.726 --> 09:55.421
in front of several
important people

09:55.494 --> 09:58.986
uh, d- d- during
the last ground shake.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.727
Uh, very embarrassing, l'm sure.

10:01.801 --> 10:02.995
l did nothing of the sort.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.194
Well, my, uh...

10:04.303 --> 10:07.431
uh, uh...
my hearing is not as good

10:07.540 --> 10:09.508
as it used to be,
nor my memory, either.

10:09.575 --> 10:13.136
Now, uh... uh,
what were we talking about?

10:13.212 --> 10:16.443
We were talking
about ancient superstitions.

10:16.515 --> 10:18.642
Now, l don't believe
for a moment

10:18.718 --> 10:22.620
that the stars are gods,
but then, what are they?

10:22.688 --> 10:24.815
A great mystery

10:24.890 --> 10:27.518
to which there is no answer.

10:27.593 --> 10:29.959
l believe the sky
is full of people

10:30.096 --> 10:31.586
just like ourselves.

10:31.664 --> 10:32.790
Wha...?

10:32.865 --> 10:34.526
Oh, nonsense.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.931
Prove me wrong.

10:36.035 --> 10:38.230
l say each star
encompasses a city,

10:38.337 --> 10:41.431
and the Ground Shaker rules
one of these cities- -

10:41.540 --> 10:43.474
a fellow Protector.

10:43.542 --> 10:46.010
lf l'm correct, then
he'll listen to me,

10:46.145 --> 10:47.476
one Protector to another.

10:47.546 --> 10:48.570
Your pen.

11:01.627 --> 11:03.424
l, Kelemane...

11:03.496 --> 11:04.622
''Kelemane...''

11:04.697 --> 11:07.131
son of Kelemane,

11:07.199 --> 11:10.191
ruler of the good people
of the land below you, demand

11:10.269 --> 11:12.169
- that you stop what you're...
- ''Demand''?

11:12.238 --> 11:14.263
''Would hope''?

11:14.373 --> 11:15.897
Ah, better. Much better.

11:16.075 --> 11:17.702
...would hope
that you might

11:17.777 --> 11:20.940
consider putting an end
to whatever it is you're doing

11:21.080 --> 11:22.570
that shakes our ground.

11:22.648 --> 11:24.548
lf this causes
you inconvenience,

11:24.617 --> 11:27.814
l'm willing
to offer a recompense.

11:29.522 --> 11:34.255
''...a recom... pense.''

11:34.326 --> 11:37.090
l await your reply.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.575
The next series of scans
is coming through.

12:26.645 --> 12:29.671
l'm downloading them
into the display buffer.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.377
No doubt about it.

12:32.451 --> 12:33.941
There's a city down there.

12:34.019 --> 12:36.647
Elevated levels
of carbon monoxide, ammonium- -

12:36.722 --> 12:38.280
that's progress, all right.

12:38.357 --> 12:40.825
They've developed
internal combustion technology

12:40.893 --> 12:42.155
since the last few scans.

12:42.228 --> 12:43.593
Look at those radial lines.

12:43.662 --> 12:46.324
lt looks like a
system of roads.

12:46.398 --> 12:47.865
Well, one thing hasn't changed.

12:47.933 --> 12:51.596
The geological disturbances that
Voyager seems to be causing.

12:51.704 --> 12:54.195
The probe recorded
half a dozen each month.

12:54.306 --> 12:56.740
Still no way to tell
how severe they are.

12:56.809 --> 12:59.107
Look at the amount of iron
being used in that city.

12:59.178 --> 13:00.975
That's ten times
what you'd expect to see

13:01.046 --> 13:02.877
in a culture
at this stage of development.

13:03.015 --> 13:05.347
Do you think they're using it
to support their buildings?

13:05.417 --> 13:07.749
lf you lived on a planet
that wouldn't stop shaking,

13:07.820 --> 13:09.378
you might be doing
the same thing.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.015
lf they've reached this stage
of industrial development,

13:12.091 --> 13:14.423
they must be observing us.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.198
The probe's impulse thrusters
are starting to fail.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.167
At its present altitude,
it's been operating

13:23.269 --> 13:24.258
for over 200 years.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.304
lts orbit
is becoming decayed.

13:26.372 --> 13:28.306
lnitiate self- destruct.

13:31.977 --> 13:33.069
lt disintegrated

13:33.145 --> 13:34.669
in the upper thermosphere.

13:34.747 --> 13:38.274
lf they saw anything, it just
looked like a shooting star.

13:59.071 --> 14:01.164
Any response
to our transmission?

14:01.273 --> 14:02.331
Nothing.

14:02.441 --> 14:05.842
No visual change either.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.606
Surprised?

14:07.680 --> 14:11.047
Send it again.

14:11.116 --> 14:13.778
The entire sequence?

14:13.853 --> 14:15.616
How about
just the prime numbers?

14:15.688 --> 14:17.656
You're tired.

14:17.723 --> 14:19.520
So are you.

14:21.193 --> 14:24.424
The prime numbers
and the elemental constants.

14:24.496 --> 14:25.758
Then we'll stop.

14:25.831 --> 14:27.628
An acceptable compromise.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.897
lt's not as if
they're going anywhere,

14:31.003 --> 14:33.597
if they even exist
in the first place.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.173
Do you doubt that?

14:35.274 --> 14:37.504
l doubt everything.

14:37.576 --> 14:40.136
So you weren't one
of those children

14:40.212 --> 14:45.809
that had the entire series
of Sky Ship Friends, hmm?

14:45.885 --> 14:48.149
Actually, l had them all,
even the duplicates.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.653
You couldn't walk into my home

14:49.722 --> 14:51.519
without tripping over
a friend or two.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.353
Not in our home.

14:53.425 --> 14:55.950
My grandfather
wouldn't allow it.

14:56.095 --> 15:00.122
He told us that the Sky Ship
was a palace

15:00.199 --> 15:02.599
where an evil Protector lived.

15:02.701 --> 15:04.669
He said that bad children

15:04.770 --> 15:06.829
were sent there to be punished.

15:07.006 --> 15:13.241
At this point,
l'd be happy to see anything...

15:13.312 --> 15:16.247
evil or not.

15:16.315 --> 15:18.715
Can you boost
the signal?

15:18.784 --> 15:22.015
We're already at maximum.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.816
Maybe if we switched

15:23.889 --> 15:26.153
to a different carrier wave...

15:30.896 --> 15:33.421
lf there is somebody up there,
they don't like us very much.

15:33.499 --> 15:36.434
Any beings capable
of building that Sky Ship

15:36.535 --> 15:39.163
could have destroyed
our world long ago.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.102
They're not causing

15:41.173 --> 15:43.641
the tremors on purpose.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.903
What if they're all dead?

15:47.980 --> 15:51.916
lf you truly believe that,
why did you join this project?

15:51.984 --> 15:54.179
Well, l doubt everything,
remember?

15:54.253 --> 15:55.914
Even my own doubts.

15:57.222 --> 15:59.713
l hope someone is up there.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.259
So do l.

16:05.064 --> 16:07.032
lf they won't respond
to mathematics,

16:07.099 --> 16:08.361
perhaps we should try

16:08.434 --> 16:11.369
a more personal approach.

16:11.437 --> 16:13.598
Here.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.339
Say hello.

16:19.411 --> 16:21.606
How could they possibly speak
our language?

16:21.680 --> 16:22.977
There's only one way

16:23.048 --> 16:24.276
to find out.

16:26.518 --> 16:28.713
What... what should l say?

16:28.787 --> 16:30.846
Oh, ''Glad to meet you.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.584
''Where are you from?

16:32.658 --> 16:35.149
Please stop shaking our planet.''

16:44.570 --> 16:47.038
An ultrahigh frequency signal

16:47.106 --> 16:50.405
is being transmitted
from the surface.

16:51.643 --> 16:53.372
The modulation is unfamiliar.

16:53.445 --> 16:55.606
lts Doppler component is...

16:55.681 --> 16:58.206
Any signal from the surface
will be accelerated.

16:58.283 --> 16:59.807
When it reached
our time frame,

16:59.885 --> 17:00.943
the frequency would be

17:01.053 --> 17:03.021
thousands of times
higher than normal.

17:03.055 --> 17:04.750
l'll attempt to
slow it down.

17:06.492 --> 17:07.459
Again.

17:08.961 --> 17:11.020
Amplitude modulation.

17:11.096 --> 17:13.155
lt's a radio transmission.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.759
lt's a numerical sequence.

17:16.868 --> 17:20.305
Prime numbers.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.704
They're sending
a list of prime numbers.

17:22.775 --> 17:25.403
Followed by a sequence
of mathematical constants

17:25.477 --> 17:27.809
and what appears
to be a vocal modulation.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.211
Slow it down again.

17:31.183 --> 17:33.777
A little more.

17:33.852 --> 17:36.980
Good friends in the Sky Ship- -

17:37.056 --> 17:39.217
l call you that,

17:39.291 --> 17:42.226
hoping at least
you're not enemies.

17:42.294 --> 17:44.421
There's nothing on our world

17:44.496 --> 17:46.691
that resembles your technology,

17:46.765 --> 17:48.892
so we assume you came here

17:49.001 --> 17:52.437
from a nearby planet
or a distant star.

17:52.538 --> 17:57.271
Our ancient mythology describes
your arrival centuries ago

17:57.342 --> 17:58.900
coinciding with the tremors

17:59.078 --> 18:01.478
that continually
shake our planet

18:01.580 --> 18:05.209
and destroy so many
of our accomplishments.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.242
l hope that was never
your intention.

18:08.320 --> 18:11.483
But the result is the same.

18:11.557 --> 18:14.822
Respond if you can,
or if you wish,

18:14.893 --> 18:18.124
come down from your Sky Ship
and visit us.

18:18.197 --> 18:21.189
Well, we've got to let them know
we're not doing it on purpose.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.358
lnadvisable.

18:22.468 --> 18:24.129
The Prime Directive
still applies.

18:24.236 --> 18:27.262
This transmission was made
with primitive radio technology.

18:27.372 --> 18:29.465
They are not
a warp- capable civilization.

18:29.575 --> 18:31.668
To hell with the
Prime Directive.

18:31.743 --> 18:33.734
That man deserves an answer.

18:33.812 --> 18:35.780
Don't forget
the temporal differential.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.873
That man has been dead
for a long time.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.850
Nearly a century by now.

18:39.918 --> 18:42.580
Okay, so we send a message
to his great- grandchildren.

18:42.654 --> 18:44.713
l'll gladly do the honors.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.348
Ancient mythology- - that means

18:46.425 --> 18:48.359
we've already
insinuated ourselves

18:48.427 --> 18:49.519
into their culture.

18:49.595 --> 18:51.392
Why not take the next step?

18:51.463 --> 18:53.897
First contact
with a pre- warp society.

18:54.032 --> 18:56.227
We've already made
first contact.

18:56.335 --> 18:58.303
They know we're up here.

18:58.370 --> 19:00.998
Well, they've known
for hundreds of years,

19:01.106 --> 19:04.269
which means our presence
has been tempered by time.

19:04.343 --> 19:07.312
We've gradually become
part of their mythos.

19:07.379 --> 19:11.406
Meeting us could throw that
belief system into chaos.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.542
But we're destroying
their planet.

19:13.619 --> 19:14.551
You heard him.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.383
A first contact, face- to- face,

19:16.455 --> 19:19.754
might give us information
we could use to leave orbit.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.622
That would stop the damage.

19:21.693 --> 19:23.388
lt's worth the risk.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.362
We don't even know
if an away team

19:25.430 --> 19:28.228
could survive the transition
to their time frame.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.063
Doctor, correct me if l'm wrong,

19:30.169 --> 19:32.228
but the physiological stress
could be fatal.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.828
For one of you, perhaps,
but not for me.

19:34.940 --> 19:37.101
My holo- matrix
would be unaffected.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.885
You'd be going
only as an observer.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.149
You're not to
make contact.

19:52.224 --> 19:54.522
l localized the source
of the transmission

19:54.593 --> 19:55.560
to a subcontinent

19:55.627 --> 19:57.185
in the southern
hemisphere.

19:57.262 --> 19:58.456
The Central Protectorate.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.758
How do you know that?

19:59.831 --> 20:01.298
l've been looking
at the data

20:01.366 --> 20:02.355
from Astrometrics.

20:02.434 --> 20:03.594
Seven's picked up a few

20:03.702 --> 20:05.135
of their local transmissions.

20:05.204 --> 20:08.071
l can tell you the names
of all 26 states on the planet.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.437
And all the best places to eat?

20:09.508 --> 20:10.634
Just about.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.472
So, is this Central
Protectorate

20:12.544 --> 20:14.409
a good place to
send the Doctor?

20:14.479 --> 20:16.811
Probably. Judging
from the transmissions,

20:16.882 --> 20:19.043
they seem to have
a tolerant society.

20:19.117 --> 20:22.280
Hmm. Well, just to
be on the safe side,

20:22.354 --> 20:24.914
l'll find him
an isolated spot.

20:24.990 --> 20:25.957
l'm giving you access

20:26.091 --> 20:27.718
to your facial
and epidermal parameters.

20:27.793 --> 20:29.522
You should be able
to mimic the appearance

20:29.595 --> 20:31.586
of whoever is down there
in a matter of seconds.

20:31.663 --> 20:35.531
What if they're big
purple blobs of protoplasm?

20:35.634 --> 20:37.602
Then you'll be the best- looking
blob on the planet.

20:37.703 --> 20:39.102
l'm keeping you down there

20:39.171 --> 20:40.638
for three seconds, Doctor.

20:40.706 --> 20:43.197
That'll be almost two days
in their time frame.

20:43.308 --> 20:44.798
Gather whatever data you can- -

20:44.910 --> 20:46.878
seismic charts,
meteorological records,

20:46.945 --> 20:50.005
anything that might give us
a clue about how to break orbit.

20:50.148 --> 20:51.581
Understood.

20:51.650 --> 20:52.708
This will speed up

20:52.784 --> 20:54.809
the scanning rate
of your program...

20:54.886 --> 20:56.820
allow you to make
the transition.

20:58.757 --> 21:01.419
See you soon.

21:04.963 --> 21:07.523
Energizing.

21:11.637 --> 21:12.899
One...

21:13.005 --> 21:15.098
two...

21:15.207 --> 21:16.265
three.

21:21.413 --> 21:23.677
The confinement beam
is destabilizing.

21:23.749 --> 21:25.273
lt's the temporal field.

21:25.350 --> 21:26.942
We'll have to recalibrate.

21:27.085 --> 21:28.552
Every second
he's down there,

21:28.620 --> 21:30.520
he's in danger of
being discovered.

21:30.589 --> 21:31.954
Locking on again.

21:37.529 --> 21:39.463
We've lost him.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.196
l'm scanning within
a 100- kilometer radius

21:47.306 --> 21:49.240
of where we sent
him- - nothing.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.538
He could've moved
across the continent by now

21:51.610 --> 21:53.305
or to the other side
of the planet.

21:53.378 --> 21:55.312
lncreasing radius
to 1,000 kilometers.

21:57.549 --> 21:59.642
Chakotay to Seven of Nine.

21:59.718 --> 22:01.117
Go ahead, Commander.

22:01.219 --> 22:03.278
Have you picked up
any information

22:03.322 --> 22:05.790
regarding opera houses
or concert halls?

22:05.857 --> 22:08.451
The cultural center
of the state runs

22:08.527 --> 22:11.257
along the shore
of the eastern lake.

22:14.533 --> 22:15.795
Got him.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.459
B'Elanna, stand by

22:17.569 --> 22:18.900
for the coordinates.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.494
Acknowledged.

22:20.605 --> 22:22.937
l've reinitialized
the confinement beam.

22:23.075 --> 22:24.167
lt's holding.

22:24.242 --> 22:25.368
Locking on.

22:33.552 --> 22:34.484
Captain!

22:34.553 --> 22:36.043
Lieutenant!

22:37.422 --> 22:39.515
l thought l'd never
see you again.

22:39.591 --> 22:41.684
Are you all right?

22:41.760 --> 22:43.057
Oh, l- l've had
a few close calls

22:43.128 --> 22:44.527
over the years,
but all in all...

22:44.596 --> 22:45.563
''Years''?

22:45.630 --> 22:47.097
lt's been over three.

22:47.165 --> 22:48.359
But at least l knew

22:48.433 --> 22:49.866
you hadn't left me behind.

22:49.968 --> 22:52.163
All l had to do was look
up, and there you were,

22:52.270 --> 22:53.669
the brightest star in the sky.

22:53.739 --> 22:55.297
Well, what do they know
about us?

22:55.407 --> 22:57.602
Only that we arrived here
centuries ago.

22:57.676 --> 22:58.608
They blame us

22:58.677 --> 23:00.269
for the seismic tremors,

23:00.345 --> 23:02.472
but everything else
is pure speculation.

23:02.547 --> 23:03.571
And let me tell you,

23:03.648 --> 23:04.979
they like nothing better

23:05.050 --> 23:06.779
than to speculate
about Voyager.

23:06.852 --> 23:09.047
Doric would go on and on- -

23:09.121 --> 23:10.053
''Sky Ship this,

23:10.122 --> 23:11.111
Sky Ship that.''

23:11.189 --> 23:12.121
Doric?

23:12.190 --> 23:14.249
The owner of the
building l lived in,

23:14.326 --> 23:15.623
until the war started.

23:15.694 --> 23:16.626
There was a war?

23:16.695 --> 23:18.754
Oh... the neighboring
state decided

23:18.830 --> 23:20.764
to lob a few cannon
shells at us.

23:20.832 --> 23:24.290
Our tactical air
command responded,

23:24.369 --> 23:25.563
and a new treaty
was signed...

23:25.670 --> 23:26.602
in a matter of weeks,

23:26.671 --> 23:28.502
but not before my
apartment was in ruins.

23:28.573 --> 23:30.939
Oh, so they have
aviation technology?

23:31.076 --> 23:32.907
They're hardly
savages, Captain.

23:32.978 --> 23:36.038
ln fact, they're making
great strides technologically,

23:36.114 --> 23:37.706
thanks, in part, to Voyager.

23:37.783 --> 23:39.375
What do you mean?

23:39.451 --> 23:42.045
From the moment our ship arrived
in the sky,

23:42.120 --> 23:44.315
they've been trying
to make contact.

23:44.389 --> 23:46.880
Our presence...
has encouraged invention,

23:46.958 --> 23:48.550
religion, science, art,

23:48.627 --> 23:50.288
even children's toys.

23:50.362 --> 23:53.957
They're all variations
on a single theme- - Voyager.

23:54.065 --> 23:56.090
Mariza even composed an aria

23:56.201 --> 23:57.964
based on the Sky Ship.

23:58.136 --> 23:59.694
l sang the lyric.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.067
Mariza?

24:01.173 --> 24:03.334
She was my...

24:03.375 --> 24:04.899
roommate.

24:09.314 --> 24:11.248
Three years is a long time,

24:11.316 --> 24:13.250
Captain.

24:13.318 --> 24:15.218
One needs...

24:15.287 --> 24:17.551
companionship.

24:17.689 --> 24:20.249
You'll get no argument from me.

24:22.027 --> 24:23.619
But did you learn anything

24:23.695 --> 24:25.560
that might help
us break orbit?

24:25.630 --> 24:27.495
lt's all in here.

24:29.901 --> 24:31.232
Meteorological records

24:31.336 --> 24:32.462
for the last 300 years- -

24:32.571 --> 24:34.198
l've committed them all
to memory.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.637
Some are inaccurate almanacs,

24:35.707 --> 24:38.676
but the more recent ones include
detailed seismic analyses.

24:38.777 --> 24:40.506
Get that information
to Astrometrics.

24:40.579 --> 24:42.740
See if you can find any
pattern to the quakes.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.679
Might help us figure
a way out of here.

24:44.749 --> 24:45.681
See you in Sick Bay.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.479
l'll download the data
from your program,

24:47.552 --> 24:49.520
and we'll do
a little cosmetic surgery, too.

24:49.588 --> 24:51.112
Lieutenant?

24:51.189 --> 24:53.282
Unless you prefer
looking like that.

24:55.994 --> 24:57.859
Of course- - l completely forgot.

24:58.897 --> 24:59.955
l must tell you,

25:00.031 --> 25:02.465
if some of the people
on the planet had their way,

25:02.501 --> 25:04.526
those weapons would
be pointed at Voyager.

25:04.636 --> 25:07.104
Luckily, the ship is still
out of range- - for now.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.730
l guess l can't
blame them.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.274
There's something
of a space race going on

25:11.343 --> 25:12.833
between the various states.

25:13.011 --> 25:15.878
Who can get to the starship
first with a rocket?

25:16.014 --> 25:18.881
Are we talking about a
capsule with an astronaut

25:18.950 --> 25:20.611
or a missile
with a warhead?

25:20.685 --> 25:21.879
l can't answer that.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.386
But at their present rate
of development,

25:24.456 --> 25:27.118
we won't have to wait
very long to find out.

25:29.394 --> 25:30.554
How does this sound?

25:30.629 --> 25:33.257
''The Weird Planet
Where Time Moved Very Fast

25:33.331 --> 25:35.629
and So Did the People
Who Lived There,''

25:35.700 --> 25:36.894
by Naomi Wildman.

25:37.068 --> 25:40.629
That's what l'm calling my
report for astronomy class.

25:40.739 --> 25:44.175
Neelix said l should choose
a planet to write about.

25:44.276 --> 25:45.743
So l picked this one.

25:45.810 --> 25:48.108
Your title is...
verbose.

25:48.179 --> 25:51.273
l suggest you try
to condense it.

25:51.349 --> 25:53.442
''The Weird Planet.''

25:53.518 --> 25:56.612
Better,
but it lacks precision.

25:56.688 --> 25:59.384
''The Weird Planet
Displaced in Time.''

25:59.457 --> 26:01.618
Perfect.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.318
Seven of Nine to the Bridge.

26:03.361 --> 26:06.455
l'm transmitting my calculations
directly to the helm.

26:06.531 --> 26:07.463
Acknowledged.

26:07.532 --> 26:08.464
What's happening?

26:08.533 --> 26:10.091
The Doctor brought back data

26:10.201 --> 26:12.226
regarding the planet's
graviton field.

26:12.337 --> 26:14.532
We're using it
to realign our thrusters.

26:14.639 --> 26:16.971
That'll be great for my report.

26:17.042 --> 26:18.270
All hands, this is the Captain.

26:18.343 --> 26:20.311
Secure your stations
and prepare to break orbit.

26:20.378 --> 26:21.345
Brace yourself.

26:25.717 --> 26:28.277
Our altitude
is increasing.

26:28.353 --> 26:30.287
50 meters...

26:30.355 --> 26:31.322
60...

26:34.526 --> 26:36.426
Seven of Nine to the Bridge.

26:36.494 --> 26:38.462
Our attempt to leave orbit

26:38.530 --> 26:41.294
is increasing
the seismic activity.

26:41.366 --> 26:42.628
We must abort.

26:42.701 --> 26:44.669
Agreed.

26:44.736 --> 26:46.670
ls the planet okay?

26:46.738 --> 26:50.606
Minimal damage along
the equatorial coastline- -

26:50.675 --> 26:52.609
nothing serious.

26:52.677 --> 26:56.135
Seven... do you think
we'll ever be able to leave?

26:56.214 --> 26:58.478
Eventually.

26:58.550 --> 27:00.415
l hope so.

27:00.518 --> 27:02.679
l need a way to end my report.

27:06.725 --> 27:08.454
Orbital 1
to Launch Control.

27:08.526 --> 27:11.324
We're ready to ignite
second- stage propellants.

27:11.396 --> 27:12.829
Proceed.

27:16.167 --> 27:18.829
Second- stage propellants
depleted.

27:18.937 --> 27:20.529
Final stage- - ready.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.233
Ready to ignite
final- stage propellants.

27:25.677 --> 27:26.769
Launch Control,

27:26.845 --> 27:29.313
we are awaiting
your command to proceed.

27:31.016 --> 27:32.608
What was that?

27:32.684 --> 27:36.620
There's nothing wrong
with the transponder.

27:36.688 --> 27:38.485
Orbital 1
to Launch Control.

27:38.556 --> 27:40.547
We're not receiving
your orders.

27:40.625 --> 27:41.557
Everything else

27:41.626 --> 27:43.594
is working perfectly.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.857
lgnite the final stage.

27:45.930 --> 27:47.625
We have to proceed

27:47.699 --> 27:49.997
with the mission.

27:57.342 --> 28:00.709
Final- stage propellants
depleted.

28:00.779 --> 28:03.907
lnitiate deceleration thrusters.

28:06.384 --> 28:07.681
Thrusters active.

28:09.954 --> 28:11.819
Watch your pitch angle.

28:11.956 --> 28:13.389
Correcting.

28:13.458 --> 28:16.222
Distance check.

28:16.294 --> 28:18.387
We're in rendezvous range.

28:18.463 --> 28:20.624
Rendezvous sequence...

28:20.699 --> 28:21.597
locked in.

28:21.666 --> 28:24.760
Moving into final position.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.564
Distance check.

28:26.671 --> 28:28.536
We're within scanning range.

28:28.606 --> 28:30.574
Let's take a look.

28:34.012 --> 28:36.606
The scans won't penetrate
their hull.

28:36.681 --> 28:38.774
l guess we'll
have to go inside.

28:38.850 --> 28:40.647
We're not authorized to do that.

28:40.719 --> 28:44.815
Our orders were to learn as much
as possible about the Sky Ship.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.049
That's my intention.

28:46.124 --> 28:47.989
l saw something
that looks like

28:48.059 --> 28:49.492
a transfer port.

28:49.561 --> 28:52.553
lt might be a
place we can dock.

28:52.630 --> 28:54.257
Move in closer.

29:07.245 --> 29:09.236
Wait, wait.

29:11.049 --> 29:12.380
Are you all right?

29:12.450 --> 29:14.918
A little...
disoriented.

29:16.454 --> 29:17.921
Let's keep going.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.691
l don't understand.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.384
Her skin feels warm.

30:24.923 --> 30:27.824
lt might be some sort
of metabolic stasis...

30:27.892 --> 30:29.951
but then,
why does it look like

30:30.028 --> 30:32.724
they're just going
about their business?

30:33.765 --> 30:34.857
This isn't right.

30:34.933 --> 30:36.366
We shouldn't be here.

30:36.467 --> 30:38.401
We were never
meant to be here.

30:38.469 --> 30:39.401
Try and stay calm.

30:39.470 --> 30:40.402
We've seen enough.

30:40.471 --> 30:41.631
Please, we have to leave.

30:41.739 --> 30:42.899
You're the best pilot we have.

30:43.007 --> 30:44.406
That's why you're
on this mission.

30:44.475 --> 30:46.534
This is no different
than flying your favorite...

30:46.611 --> 30:48.306
Oh, it's different.

30:49.814 --> 30:51.577
l can't argue with that.

30:51.649 --> 30:54.846
Another few minutes,
then we'll go back.

31:01.159 --> 31:03.992
This looks like
their command center.

31:23.548 --> 31:27.746
This is not metabolic stasis.

31:27.819 --> 31:30.845
Could the laws of physics
be different here?

31:30.922 --> 31:33.390
Maybe they're just
a little slower.

31:34.425 --> 31:35.392
What's wrong?

31:45.637 --> 31:46.763
lntruder alert.

31:46.871 --> 31:49.101
Security Team to Deck 1.

31:49.173 --> 31:50.538
Captain, l'm picking up a ship

31:50.608 --> 31:51.540
at Docking Port 1.

31:51.609 --> 31:52.667
lt just appeared there.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.712
Bridge to Sick Bay.
Medical emergency.

31:58.850 --> 32:00.044
What can you tell me?

32:00.151 --> 32:01.914
The transition
to our time frame

32:01.986 --> 32:03.578
was a little rough for them.

32:03.655 --> 32:06.021
l'm afraid his colleague
didn't make it.

32:06.090 --> 32:07.148
How is he?

32:07.225 --> 32:08.419
Recovering.

32:08.493 --> 32:11.326
Lucky for him, l'm as good
as his family doctor.

32:11.396 --> 32:12.886
After three years

32:12.964 --> 32:14.761
of poring over their
medical journals,

32:14.832 --> 32:18.268
l know as much about their
physiology as l do yours.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.802
Easy.

32:29.180 --> 32:30.772
Where's Terina?

32:30.848 --> 32:33.544
She didn't survive
the transition.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.643
l'm very sorry.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.449
Transition?

32:37.522 --> 32:39.285
To your time frame?

32:41.893 --> 32:44.327
You understand
what's happened to you.

32:44.395 --> 32:46.329
l'm beginning to.

32:46.397 --> 32:49.730
Voyager exists
in the same space- time

32:49.834 --> 32:51.927
as the rest of the galaxy.

32:52.036 --> 32:53.970
Your planet is different.

32:55.740 --> 32:58.709
So you really haven't been
watching us for centuries.

32:58.776 --> 33:01.643
Actually, we just got here...

33:01.746 --> 33:05.409
and we're hoping you can help us
find a way to leave.

33:11.356 --> 33:13.017
So, if what you're
saying is true,

33:13.091 --> 33:18.358
everyone l know...
everyone l knew is gone.

33:18.429 --> 33:20.056
That's correct.

33:22.533 --> 33:25.058
Captain, l'm an
accomplished pilot.

33:25.169 --> 33:28.661
That's why they chose me
for this mission.

33:28.773 --> 33:31.333
l don't have the courage
of the others.

33:31.442 --> 33:33.569
They made a mistake
choosing me.

33:33.644 --> 33:35.202
l have to disagree.

33:35.279 --> 33:37.372
For someone whose
life has just been

33:37.448 --> 33:40.246
turned upside down, l
think you're doing fine.

33:42.153 --> 33:43.950
When l was a young child,

33:44.022 --> 33:47.389
the toys hanging above my crib
depicted the Sky Ship.

33:47.458 --> 33:50.188
lt's the first thing
l ever remember seeing,

33:50.261 --> 33:52.661
even before my mother's face...

33:52.730 --> 33:56.632
and now l'm the only one
that knows its name- -

33:56.734 --> 33:58.702
Voyager.

34:00.705 --> 34:03.697
l suppose it'll be
the last thing l see as well.

34:03.808 --> 34:05.435
Well, that's up to you.

34:05.510 --> 34:06.442
l have no intention

34:06.511 --> 34:08.274
of keeping you here
against your will.

34:08.346 --> 34:11.577
The Doctor spent some
time on your planet

34:11.649 --> 34:13.047
collecting data that
we hoped would help us

34:13.117 --> 34:15.141
find a way to leave orbit.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.447
We need you to assist us

34:16.521 --> 34:19.045
in interpreting
that information.

34:19.123 --> 34:23.525
However...
the longer you stay on board,

34:23.594 --> 34:25.891
the more difficult it will be
for you to go home.

34:25.963 --> 34:27.362
Your culture is changing

34:27.431 --> 34:29.456
every second you're here.

34:29.534 --> 34:31.297
By the time you go back,

34:31.402 --> 34:34.393
you might find it
more alien than ours.

34:39.077 --> 34:42.205
Star of the night,
star of the day

34:42.280 --> 34:47.183
Come to take my tears away

34:47.251 --> 34:51.915
Make my life always bright...

34:55.059 --> 34:56.958
lt's a child's prayer.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.722
To Voyager?

34:58.796 --> 35:01.458
Yes.

35:01.566 --> 35:04.091
l hope you're not disappointed.

35:04.168 --> 35:09.663
How often does your
very first dream come true?

35:10.975 --> 35:12.943
Of course l'll help you.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.811
The information l brought back
is in Voyager's database.

35:19.884 --> 35:22.045
Seven of Nine has been trying
to make sense of it.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.417
She'll welcome
your assistance.

35:23.488 --> 35:25.319
Mountain or Lakeside?

35:25.389 --> 35:26.447
Mountain, of course.

35:26.524 --> 35:28.219
Don't tell me
you're a Lakeside supporter.

35:28.292 --> 35:29.884
You really were
on the surface.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.258
How are they doing this season?

35:31.329 --> 35:33.820
Not good- - five wins, 12 losses.

35:33.898 --> 35:36.128
l don't believe it.
Who's guarding for them?

35:36.234 --> 35:37.201
Torelius.

35:37.268 --> 35:38.394
Any relation
to the Torelius?

35:38.503 --> 35:39.470
His grandson.

35:39.537 --> 35:41.903
l saw the original
defend for Mountain

35:41.973 --> 35:43.804
in the playoffs
against Red River.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.274
That was before
l was born.

35:45.343 --> 35:47.208
He would have gone
into voluntary exile

35:47.278 --> 35:49.075
after a 5- 12 season!

35:50.348 --> 35:52.248
This information
is out of date.

35:52.316 --> 35:55.251
We were far more advanced
than this when l left.

35:55.319 --> 35:56.718
l can help you correct it.

35:56.787 --> 35:58.049
Very well.

35:58.122 --> 35:59.987
Let's start
with the geological data.

36:00.091 --> 36:03.583
The seismic detectors back then
were off by a variance of 3.8.

36:03.628 --> 36:06.188
A simple conversion will
compensate for that.

36:09.033 --> 36:11.968
Does every planet
look like ours?

36:12.036 --> 36:13.333
None that l've seen.

36:13.437 --> 36:15.302
Your world appears to be unique.

36:15.373 --> 36:18.103
lf we're so out of step
with everything else,

36:18.176 --> 36:21.577
we'll never be able to explore
space the way you have.

36:21.646 --> 36:23.136
You're a highly adaptable
species.

36:23.214 --> 36:25.239
Your scientists will find
a way to compensate

36:25.316 --> 36:26.783
for the temporal differential.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.445
They'd better do it
before you leave.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.622
Without the Sky Ship
up above them,

36:32.690 --> 36:35.158
my people might lose interest
in progress.

36:35.226 --> 36:37.854
There wouldn't be anything left
to reach for.

36:37.929 --> 36:39.897
Perhaps they'll
miss Voyager so much,

36:39.997 --> 36:42.488
they'll do everything they can
to follow us.

36:42.567 --> 36:43.966
Maybe so.

36:46.604 --> 36:47.662
What was that?

36:47.772 --> 36:50.332
An antimatter implosion.

36:50.441 --> 36:53.137
Your world is experimenting
with warp technology.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.145
Sensors detected
an early test.

36:56.714 --> 36:59.205
Another test- - 
six weeks later.

37:00.451 --> 37:03.181
And a third- - more
controlled each time.

37:03.254 --> 37:05.017
They're learning quickly.

37:08.292 --> 37:09.919
Too quickly.

37:09.994 --> 37:11.586
What was that?

37:11.662 --> 37:14.654
Unknown, but our shields
are down to 82 percent.

37:17.201 --> 37:19.169
64 percent.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.171
l don't know what's causing it.
There's nothing on sensors.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.570
Janeway to Seven of Nine.

37:22.640 --> 37:23.607
Go ahead, Captain.

37:23.674 --> 37:25.141
Are you picking up anything

37:25.209 --> 37:26.403
in Astrometrics?

37:26.477 --> 37:27.739
The inhabitants
appear to have

37:27.812 --> 37:30.246
developed antimatter
torpedo technology.

37:30.314 --> 37:31.906
l believe we're under attack.

37:40.891 --> 37:43.985
Another direct hit.
Shields at 49 percent.

37:44.061 --> 37:45.323
Captain, l apologize
for this attack.

37:45.396 --> 37:46.420
They have no right.

37:46.497 --> 37:48.897
Unfortunately,
they've got every right.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.331
Let me talk to them.

37:50.434 --> 37:51.696
We've already tried
to hail them.

37:51.802 --> 37:53.099
lt doesn't look
like they're able

37:53.204 --> 37:54.364
to receive our transmissions.

37:54.472 --> 37:56.940
They still don't know
about the time differential.

37:57.008 --> 37:58.305
A logical assumption.

37:59.143 --> 38:00.337
Shields down

38:00.444 --> 38:01.934
to 34 percent.

38:01.979 --> 38:04.038
The torpedoes are being fired
at three- day intervals.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.480
They're making
refinements each time,

38:05.549 --> 38:06.811
increasing the detonation yield.

38:06.884 --> 38:08.374
Captain, isn't it time

38:08.452 --> 38:09.384
we returned fire?

38:09.453 --> 38:10.385
We've done enough

38:10.454 --> 38:11.352
damage to these people

38:11.422 --> 38:12.514
over the last thousand years.

38:17.094 --> 38:18.322
You've got to go back.

38:18.396 --> 38:19.829
lt's the only way.

38:19.897 --> 38:21.728
Make them understand who we are.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.926
You have the specifications
of this ship.

38:24.035 --> 38:27.129
Your scientists might be able
to use them to help free us.

38:27.238 --> 38:29.706
At the very least,
get them to hold their fire.

38:29.807 --> 38:31.638
Captain, the transporters
are off- line.

38:31.709 --> 38:33.108
ls his vessel still intact?

38:33.177 --> 38:35.304
The docking port
hasn't been hit yet.

38:35.379 --> 38:37.870
Good luck.

38:44.388 --> 38:47.152
This will accelerate your
metabolic functions- -

38:47.224 --> 38:48.885
help you make the transition.

38:48.959 --> 38:50.551
Thank you
for everything, Doctor.

38:50.628 --> 38:53.358
lt was a pleasure to
treat a fellow citizen.

38:53.431 --> 38:54.898
Would you do me a favor?

38:54.965 --> 38:56.398
Certainly.

38:56.467 --> 38:57.627
Find out what happened

38:57.735 --> 38:59.259
to a boy named Jason Tabreez.

38:59.370 --> 39:01.338
He lived in the
Central Protectorate.

39:01.439 --> 39:03.498
Jason? An unusual name.

39:03.607 --> 39:05.802
Yes. He was my...

39:05.943 --> 39:07.376
son.

39:07.445 --> 39:09.208
But you're a hologram.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.542
lt's a long story.

39:10.614 --> 39:12.377
He's dead by now,

39:12.450 --> 39:15.214
but perhaps you could
discover what happened to him.

39:15.286 --> 39:17.117
Maybe he had children

39:17.188 --> 39:18.815
or grandchildren.

39:18.889 --> 39:20.550
You could tell them about me.

39:20.624 --> 39:23.491
l will.

39:32.937 --> 39:34.632
Orbital 1 to Launch Control.

39:34.739 --> 39:36.036
Please respond.

39:38.008 --> 39:39.600
Launch Control, please respond.

39:39.677 --> 39:41.338
Who is this?

39:41.412 --> 39:43.437
Pilot First Rank Gotana- Retz.

39:43.514 --> 39:44.776
Clear this channel,

39:44.849 --> 39:46.874
or l'm going to report you
to the Command Center.

39:47.017 --> 39:48.177
ls this Launch Control?

39:48.252 --> 39:51.278
l'm the Weather Coordinator
for Station 004.

39:51.355 --> 39:53.880
You're in violation
of transmission regulations.

39:54.024 --> 39:55.355
Please, listen to me.

39:55.426 --> 39:57.621
l'm trying
to reach Launch Control.

39:57.695 --> 39:58.787
Let me guess.

39:58.863 --> 40:00.296
You finally decided
to come home.

40:00.364 --> 40:01.296
You're Gotana- Retz?

40:01.365 --> 40:02.798
Gotana- Retz. Yes.

40:02.867 --> 40:04.892
Now, please transfer me
to Launch Control.

40:05.069 --> 40:07.629
Launch Control became
the Tactical Command Center

40:07.738 --> 40:08.898
50 years ago.

40:09.073 --> 40:10.335
You're dead.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.342
l've been inside the Sky Ship.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.435
Then it's a good thing
you decided to leave.

40:14.512 --> 40:15.945
They're about to shoot it down.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.945
l've got to speak with them!

40:18.082 --> 40:20.846
Tactical Command frequencies
are classified.

40:20.918 --> 40:22.510
Now, get off this channel.

40:22.586 --> 40:25.180
lf you've ever wanted
to report more than the weather,

40:25.256 --> 40:26.518
now is your chance.

40:26.590 --> 40:29.115
Tell them to clear Central Lake
of all traffic.

40:29.193 --> 40:33.061
Orbital 1 is coming in
for a landing.

40:37.802 --> 40:40.737
Shields at 23 percent.

40:40.805 --> 40:43.171
17 percent.

40:44.542 --> 40:46.066
Shields are down.

40:46.177 --> 40:47.804
What was that last one?

40:47.878 --> 40:49.573
A tricobalt device.

40:49.647 --> 40:51.342
What'll they think of next?

40:51.415 --> 40:53.280
Damage reports
coming in- - imminent

40:53.350 --> 40:55.341
hull breaches on Decks
8, 9 and 10.

40:55.419 --> 40:56.681
Life support is failing.

40:56.754 --> 40:58.745
Our astronaut should
have made it by now.

40:58.823 --> 41:02.122
Based on his descent velocity,
he landed about ten minutes ago.

41:02.226 --> 41:03.352
That's a year
and a half.

41:03.394 --> 41:04.656
Then he must have failed.

41:06.030 --> 41:07.463
l'm picking up
another launch- -

41:07.531 --> 41:08.896
two massive energy signatures.

41:09.033 --> 41:10.295
Tricobalt devices?

41:10.401 --> 41:11.629
Unknown.

41:11.735 --> 41:13.202
Brace yourselves.

41:19.210 --> 41:20.837
We're in some kind
of tractor beam.

41:20.911 --> 41:22.742
Captain...

41:22.813 --> 41:24.075
if l alternate thrusters,

41:24.148 --> 41:25.911
l might be able
to break us free.

41:25.983 --> 41:29.248
No. Let's give our friends
the benefit of the doubt.

41:35.392 --> 41:37.519
They're pulling us away
from the planet.

41:40.698 --> 41:42.825
We've broken orbit.

41:42.900 --> 41:44.367
Try hailing them.

41:51.408 --> 41:52.739
lt's good to see you all again.

41:52.810 --> 41:55.711
Looks like somebody down there
listened to you.

41:55.779 --> 41:57.508
l'm sorry it took so long.

41:57.581 --> 42:00.209
And now we can make first
contact the proper way.

42:00.317 --> 42:02.683
Unfortunately,
that won't be possible.

42:02.720 --> 42:04.745
A temporal compensator.

42:04.822 --> 42:07.154
lt allows me to exist
in your time frame

42:07.224 --> 42:10.785
without actually leaving my own,
but, uh, only for a few minutes.

42:10.861 --> 42:13.193
l'm afraid it'll be a while
before my people actually

42:13.264 --> 42:15.255
join the rest of the galaxy.

42:15.332 --> 42:17.163
Captain, we'll
be able to bring

42:17.268 --> 42:19.702
the warp drive back on line
in approximately two hours.

42:19.770 --> 42:23.262
Very good.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.672
Thank you.

42:25.743 --> 42:27.870
l feel like
l'm saying good- bye

42:27.945 --> 42:30.004
to an old friend.
