I do this in English

01:09.448 --> 01:13.349
because today, after
six years of waiting,

01:13.349 --> 01:16.386
we received letter
from UK government.

01:16.386 --> 01:20.701
Now we call ourselves
British family.

01:23.324 --> 01:24.601
British family.

[sirens wailing]

02:52.517 --> 02:54.035
- Listen, right, I think
there was a fair bit

02:54.035 --> 02:56.210
of back and forth about it.

02:59.040 --> 02:59.834
Yes, sir.

03:05.046 --> 03:07.359
Sorry mate, 20 minutes tops.

03:07.359 --> 03:08.567
Absolutely.

03:08.567 --> 03:09.810
Yes, sir.

03:09.810 --> 03:10.914
Yes, I did see that.

03:12.813 --> 03:14.677
Boss has got the hump.

03:14.677 --> 03:17.058
You and me got better things
to be doing apparently.

03:17.058 --> 03:18.681
- I mean, why is this not
a counterterrorism job?

03:18.681 --> 03:19.958
That's what I'm asking.

03:19.958 --> 03:21.546
- Counter-terrorism
don't want it,

03:21.546 --> 03:23.306
say they don't deal
with homicides.

03:23.306 --> 03:24.859
Homicides don't want it...

03:24.859 --> 03:26.378
- Because nobody's
actually dead.

03:26.378 --> 03:28.553
- Because nobody's
actually dead, yeah.

03:30.451 --> 03:34.110
But the real reason
nobody wants it,

03:34.110 --> 03:37.562
is because they all think
the man's lost his marbles.

03:37.562 --> 03:39.253
- Do we think that?

03:39.253 --> 03:41.117
- Oh, I can't
speak for you, Jim.

03:41.117 --> 03:43.844
I'd say let's meet the guy
first, judge for ourselves.

03:43.844 --> 03:44.672
Ha.

03:44.672 --> 03:45.604
Hi there.

03:45.604 --> 03:47.365
We're here to see a Mr. Carter.

03:47.365 --> 03:48.642
Mr. Edwin Carter.

03:50.368 --> 03:53.440
It's the one who thinks
he's been poisoned.

03:53.440 --> 03:54.648
- [Receptionist]
He's down the end.

03:54.648 --> 03:55.856

[tense music]

04:05.175 --> 04:06.142

04:06.142 --> 04:06.970
- Yeah.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.461
- Mrs. Carter?

04:14.461 --> 04:15.841
- Detective.

04:15.841 --> 04:19.638
This is a big moment for us.

04:21.053 --> 04:25.092
My husband was worried nobody
was taking this seriously.

04:25.092 --> 04:27.750
- Well, we're here
now, Mrs. Carter.

04:29.234 --> 04:33.618
- He wants the whole world
to know what has happened.

04:33.618 --> 04:34.619
You understand?

04:40.072 --> 04:42.005
- Are you okay, Mrs. Carter?

04:43.800 --> 04:46.907
- My husband is ill.

04:46.907 --> 04:49.219
This means I'm also Ill.

04:52.706 --> 04:54.121
We're together in life.

04:55.847 --> 04:57.814
- And he'll talk
to us right now?

05:03.682 --> 05:08.411
- The doctors, I know
they do not believe him,

05:09.447 --> 05:12.519
but they do not understand.

05:15.970 --> 05:16.799
- Okay.

05:48.693 --> 05:52.593
[speaking in foreign language]

05:58.392 --> 05:59.255
- Detective.

06:01.878 --> 06:03.432
I need to report a murder.

06:04.502 --> 06:05.365
- Who's murder?

06:07.470 --> 06:08.333
- Mine.

06:09.990 --> 06:13.338
Today, yes, I'm alive,
of course, I can stand.

06:13.338 --> 06:16.376
But tomorrow, no.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.930
Tomorrow I will be tired.

06:20.897 --> 06:25.143
In two days, most very weak.

06:27.041 --> 06:27.904
In three days,

06:30.217 --> 06:31.598
or maybe it take four days.

06:33.427 --> 06:34.877
- How can you know that?

06:34.877 --> 06:37.155
The number of days, I mean?

06:37.155 --> 06:39.744
If you have been
poisoned, as you say,

06:39.744 --> 06:41.401
how can you be so specific?

06:43.851 --> 06:45.715
- I know how this happened.

06:47.890 --> 06:50.099
I know when, I know why.

06:58.866 --> 07:02.525
Detective, I explain
to you my story

07:04.665 --> 07:06.356
before it is too late.

07:10.706 --> 07:13.950
- Well, if he is a nut, he's
the most levelheaded nut

07:13.950 --> 07:15.538
that I've ever come across.

07:15.538 --> 07:18.645
And I've met a few.

07:18.645 --> 07:23.235
- Okay, look, we take his
statement, hear him out.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.444
- There they are.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.997
- Who's in charge here please?

07:27.447 --> 07:30.726
Look, I'm gonna put this
as politely as I can.

07:30.726 --> 07:32.106
You need to go.

07:32.106 --> 07:33.522
- The man we're speaking to-

07:33.522 --> 07:35.972
- The man you're speaking
to is seriously ill.

07:35.972 --> 07:37.974
That's the beginning
and end of it.

07:37.974 --> 07:40.701
- He's saying that
he's been poisoned.

07:40.701 --> 07:43.359
- People say all
sorts of things.

07:43.359 --> 07:45.361
- Doesn't mean we don't
take them seriously.

07:45.361 --> 07:47.812
- Oh, we've taken
him very seriously.

07:47.812 --> 07:50.366
We've tested him for several
toxins, including thallium,

07:50.366 --> 07:52.575
which is what he's convinced
he's been poisoned with.

07:52.575 --> 07:54.508
But we just can't stand it up.

07:54.508 --> 07:55.854
- And his hair loss?

07:55.854 --> 07:58.098
- Likely a reaction
to the antibiotics.

07:59.686 --> 08:01.619
- I'm going to
take his statement.

08:01.619 --> 08:02.792
- [Doctor] It's midnight.

08:02.792 --> 08:03.862
- I appreciate that.

08:03.862 --> 08:05.139
- Good.

08:05.139 --> 08:06.382
Then for the sake of
the other patients,

08:06.382 --> 08:08.418
if that's what you
insist on doing,

08:08.418 --> 08:09.903
at least wait till the morning.

08:09.903 --> 08:11.525
- You're sure that
will be possible?

08:11.525 --> 08:12.388
- How do you mean?

08:12.388 --> 08:13.562
Sorry?

08:13.562 --> 08:16.047
- Can you give me your
personal guarantee

08:16.047 --> 08:17.911
that Mr. Carter will
be alive in the morning

08:17.911 --> 08:19.809
in order to give
us his statement?

08:19.809 --> 08:21.811
If you can, then fine.

08:21.811 --> 08:23.399
We'll come back first thing.

08:23.399 --> 08:28.128
If not, with respect,
we'll crack on.

to ask you to leave the room.

09:27.946 --> 09:31.122
Edwin, if you could just
state your name please

09:31.122 --> 09:31.950
for the tape.

09:31.950 --> 09:32.779
- My name...

09:33.918 --> 09:36.023
My name is not Edwin Carter.

09:36.023 --> 09:40.649
This name I use for protection.

09:40.649 --> 09:42.823
- So what is your name?

09:44.169 --> 09:46.655
For this statement
to be worth anything,

09:46.655 --> 09:49.209
we need to know who
we're speaking to.

09:49.209 --> 09:51.901
- My name is
Alexander Litvinenko.

09:51.901 --> 09:54.697
I am former FSB Officer.

09:56.285 --> 10:00.254
In Russia I have a senior job,

10:02.084 --> 10:04.742
deputy head of Section 7.

10:04.742 --> 10:05.674
- Section 7?

10:06.675 --> 10:08.366
- Top secret department.

10:09.988 --> 10:12.301
This job is simple job.

10:12.301 --> 10:14.303
This job is to kill.

10:16.719 --> 10:18.721
- Your job was to kill.

10:18.721 --> 10:19.688
- Yes.

10:19.688 --> 10:21.172
- [Brent] Who?

10:21.172 --> 10:23.174
- Enemies of Russian state.

10:25.555 --> 10:27.247
They give me a list.

10:27.247 --> 10:28.558
They give me names.

10:29.801 --> 10:32.010
Ask me to organize.

10:32.010 --> 10:34.737
That's why I am here today.

10:34.737 --> 10:37.188
- Because you killed people.

10:37.188 --> 10:39.121
- No, because I refuse.

10:39.121 --> 10:41.261
This job is not human.

10:41.261 --> 10:44.954
This job is corruption job.

10:44.954 --> 10:49.925
Corruption in the law and
corruption here inside.

10:53.514 --> 10:58.416
When we arrived to London,
I write book about Russia,

11:00.176 --> 11:01.246
about corruption.

11:02.558 --> 11:05.803
And when I write this book,

11:06.735 --> 11:09.841
they're very angry with me.

11:09.841 --> 11:12.326
They come find me.

11:12.326 --> 11:13.673
They want to kill me.

11:15.122 --> 11:17.262
- And because you wrote that
book, you become a target.

11:17.262 --> 11:19.782
- Yes, because I tell truth.

11:19.782 --> 11:23.268
Because I am troublemaker.

11:24.994 --> 11:28.722
- And you have any idea who
may have made this order?

11:30.759 --> 11:34.245
- Yes, I know the man
who make order for this.

11:35.315 --> 11:37.110
The man who says I must die.

11:37.110 --> 11:38.559
I know this person.

11:38.559 --> 11:39.457
- You have a name?

11:41.804 --> 11:44.186
- This man was head of FSB.

11:45.428 --> 11:46.982
- [Brent] Was?

11:46.982 --> 11:47.914
- Before, yes.

11:47.914 --> 11:48.777
Not anymore.

11:50.813 --> 11:52.332
- [Brent] What is his name?

11:52.332 --> 11:54.955
Edwin, let's start
with the name.

11:56.129 --> 11:58.510
- His name is Vladimir Putin.

12:02.204 --> 12:04.724
[sirens wailing in distance]

12:04.724 --> 12:07.796
[pensive music]

12:07.796 --> 12:08.831
- Mornin' Floppy.

12:08.831 --> 12:11.316
- [Officer] Mornin' Guv.

12:11.316 --> 12:14.803

[sirens wailing]

12:22.086 --> 12:25.606
[pensive music continues]

12:26.746 --> 12:27.954
- [TV Reporter]
It is being billed

12:27.954 --> 12:29.749
as the celebrity
wedding of the year.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.510
A list of stars gathered
in Rome for the wedding

12:32.510 --> 12:33.891
of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes.

12:33.891 --> 12:36.169
The ceremony is expected
to take place today.

12:37.308 --> 12:40.794
[pensive music continues]

12:46.800 --> 12:50.321
[pensive music continues]

12:56.948 --> 13:00.434
[pensive music continues]

13:08.028 --> 13:11.273
- We have a Russian
friend in London.

13:11.273 --> 13:12.722
Alex Goldfarb.

13:12.722 --> 13:17.520
He arranged for a photographer
to come to the hospital.

13:20.385 --> 13:23.319
He says we need publicity.

13:24.527 --> 13:25.839
For Sasha.

13:25.839 --> 13:26.702
- Sasha?

13:28.531 --> 13:29.360
- Alexander.

13:30.464 --> 13:33.813
We say Sasha for short.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.815
You think it was mistake?

13:37.092 --> 13:39.715
- Professionally
speaking, I couldn't say.

13:39.715 --> 13:41.890
Personally, if Sasha
wants the whole world

13:41.890 --> 13:43.443
to know what happened,

13:43.443 --> 13:45.894
I'd say he'd be hard pushed to
come up with anything better.

13:47.274 --> 13:48.103
- [Jim] Brent.

13:51.692 --> 13:52.797
- It's important now, Alexander,

13:52.797 --> 13:54.419
that we draw up a list of people

13:54.419 --> 13:56.663
that you've had
contact with in London.

13:56.663 --> 13:59.183
Get an idea of who
might have done this.

13:59.183 --> 14:00.322
Does that make sense?

14:03.187 --> 14:04.429
- When they come to London,

14:04.429 --> 14:06.846
they make contact
with other Russians.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.606
- [Brent] What sort of Russians?

14:10.642 --> 14:13.335
- Like me, enemies of state.

14:15.095 --> 14:16.200
Alex Goldfarb.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.134
Boris Berezovsky.

14:20.687 --> 14:23.793
And a woman who
visited from Chechnya.

14:23.793 --> 14:25.795
Anna Politkovskaya.

14:25.795 --> 14:27.521
- She is also a target.

14:27.521 --> 14:30.662
- Yes, because she
writes many articles

14:30.662 --> 14:35.046
against Putin, against
war in Chechnya.

14:36.185 --> 14:37.221
She's critic.

14:38.947 --> 14:41.018
She go home in October.

14:42.743 --> 14:44.090
She go back to Moscow.

14:44.090 --> 14:45.608
She is murdered.

14:45.608 --> 14:46.644
- [Brent] Killed?

14:46.644 --> 14:47.472
- Murdered.

14:47.472 --> 14:48.301
It is fact.

14:49.750 --> 14:51.235
I say to all media,

14:51.235 --> 14:54.859
my friend Anna has been
killed by Russian street.

14:56.723 --> 14:58.518
By Vladimir Putin.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.903
If I not explain
this, nobody will.

15:05.076 --> 15:08.390
- [Brent] And this was
in October of this year.

15:08.390 --> 15:09.356
- October 7.

15:10.737 --> 15:11.876
Putin's birthday.

15:15.915 --> 15:20.920
Next, from nowhere I receive
phone call from Italian man,

15:22.093 --> 15:24.751
intelligence expert with
connection to Russia.

15:27.340 --> 15:30.930
He says, coming to London,
he say wants to see me,

15:30.930 --> 15:32.345
wants to have lunch with me.

15:33.518 --> 15:35.072
- He calls you up
out of the blue

15:35.072 --> 15:37.591
and says he wants to meet
you for lunch in London.

15:38.454 --> 15:40.456
- [Jim] Did you have a name?

15:40.456 --> 15:42.217
- His name Mario Scaramella.

15:43.425 --> 15:46.324
- [Brent] Did he say
why he wanted to meet?

15:46.324 --> 15:48.050
But you agreed to meet him.

15:49.396 --> 15:51.467
- And do you remember
what date this was?

15:52.296 --> 15:54.125
- Yes, I remember.

15:54.125 --> 15:55.540
1st of November.

15:56.403 --> 15:58.681
Also very important day.

15:58.681 --> 15:59.510
- [Brent] Why?

16:00.649 --> 16:03.686
- Because this is the
day I am poisoned.

16:08.139 --> 16:13.144
[indistinct loudspeaker
announcement]

16:13.765 --> 16:14.663
- Detective.

16:14.663 --> 16:16.630
Alex Goldfarb.

16:16.630 --> 16:18.978
Long time friend of Sasha's.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.083
- You brought in
the photographer.

16:21.083 --> 16:25.053
- Please, this is
Professor John Henry.

16:25.053 --> 16:28.297
He is one of the world's
top toxicologists.

16:28.297 --> 16:29.712
- Detective.

16:29.712 --> 16:31.956
- We would like permission
to examine Sasha.

16:32.819 --> 16:34.234
- Oh, I'm sorry.

16:34.234 --> 16:36.892
With respect, it's not
my permission to give.

16:41.517 --> 16:44.106
[gentle music]

16:45.590 --> 16:49.353
That being said, if you do
find a way to examine him,

16:49.353 --> 16:51.355
would you mind
keeping me posted?

16:51.355 --> 16:54.254
Not exactly getting much joy
out of the doctors ourselves.

16:55.221 --> 16:58.638
[gentle music continues]

17:04.885 --> 17:05.714
- [Clive] Guv.

17:08.337 --> 17:10.374
- [Peter] He's had two
homicide detectives with him

17:10.374 --> 17:11.823
for the past 24 hours.

17:11.823 --> 17:14.826
Now, it's not our
job technically

17:14.826 --> 17:17.036
because we don't
handle homicides.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.521
But homicide is saying
it's not theirs either.

17:19.521 --> 17:21.385
- Because no one's
actually dead.

17:21.385 --> 17:23.559
- [Peter] Because no
one's actually dead.

17:23.559 --> 17:25.182
- Well, it's a fair point.

17:25.182 --> 17:28.047
- Either way, Clive, given
how this is escalating,

17:28.047 --> 17:29.393
given his background,

17:29.393 --> 17:31.981
given the international
nature of all of this,

17:31.981 --> 17:34.329
we want it as a joint inquiry,

17:34.329 --> 17:37.539
with counter-terrorism
taking the lead.

17:37.539 --> 17:40.438
And as the on-call
SIO in London...

17:40.438 --> 17:41.612
- I'm the lucky man.

17:43.545 --> 17:45.754
- I'm not sure
lucky is the word.

17:45.754 --> 17:46.996
- Oh, it might be
not for you, gov.

17:46.996 --> 17:48.860
But in my job, you can
spend your entire career

17:48.860 --> 17:51.104
waiting for something
like this to come along.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.105
And it never does.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.520
So I'll take it.

17:53.520 --> 17:56.247
[sirens wailing]

17:57.524 --> 18:01.528
- I meet Scaramella
at Piccadilly Circus.

18:01.528 --> 18:03.185
He's very worried man.

18:03.185 --> 18:04.669
He say, "Let's go,
let's go, let's go."

18:04.669 --> 18:09.295
So we walk away, we
go sushi place, Itsu.

18:09.295 --> 18:10.123
- Insu.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.090
- Itsu.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.746
Itsu, it's the name of it, Itsu.

18:12.746 --> 18:14.300
- Okay.

18:14.300 --> 18:17.199
- But then he say,
"I'm not hungry.

18:17.199 --> 18:20.996
I already have food before."

18:20.996 --> 18:22.204
- Wait.

18:22.204 --> 18:25.414
He comes all the way
from Italy for lunch.

18:25.414 --> 18:27.416
When you meet him,
he's already eaten.

18:27.416 --> 18:28.590
And the whole time
you were together,

18:28.590 --> 18:30.730
you were the only one to eat.

18:30.730 --> 18:31.558
- Only me.

18:32.421 --> 18:35.217
Scaramella only drink with lid.

18:35.217 --> 18:39.221
He's very anxious.

18:41.430 --> 18:46.435
He's very hot.

18:51.095 --> 18:52.924
Sorry, my English is not...

18:52.924 --> 18:55.582
- No, there's no rush, Sasha.

18:55.582 --> 18:56.411
- Yeah.

18:56.411 --> 18:57.653
- You take your time.

18:57.653 --> 18:58.758
- We do not have
time to take time.

18:59.862 --> 19:01.243
That is problem, detective.

19:08.526 --> 19:11.702
Scaramella say he has
something to show me.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.222
A white package.

19:15.361 --> 19:20.366
He tries give contents
of package to me.

19:21.815 --> 19:25.198
- He tried to give you the
contents of a white package.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.889
- I say, "I don't
want this paper."

19:26.889 --> 19:29.168
He say, "No, put in your bag."

19:31.480 --> 19:32.585
- [Brent] And did you?

19:34.518 --> 19:36.313
- What else can I do?

19:36.313 --> 19:39.281
I take packet, I eat food.

19:39.281 --> 19:40.869
I go.

19:40.869 --> 19:44.286
Scaramella is little bit...

19:46.875 --> 19:48.325
He is mad man.

19:49.809 --> 19:53.502
- To be clear, Scaramella
might have been the person

19:53.502 --> 19:54.745
sent to poison you.

19:57.955 --> 19:59.577
- It's possible.

19:59.577 --> 20:00.647
- Yeah.

20:00.647 --> 20:01.441
So...
[knocking at door]

20:01.441 --> 20:03.132
One minute please.

20:03.132 --> 20:05.411
- Mr. Carlton needs
his medication.

20:09.449 --> 20:10.278
- Excuse me.

20:11.762 --> 20:15.904
- Detective, I ask Marina to
bring you a copy of my book.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.706
This is from me to you.

20:26.604 --> 20:27.433
- Thank you.

20:33.197 --> 20:34.509
- There you go.

20:34.509 --> 20:36.096
Scaramella.

20:36.096 --> 20:37.684
I don't mind
calling that one in.

20:41.032 --> 20:44.070
[cell phone ringing]

20:45.382 --> 20:46.175
- Brent Hyatt.

20:52.906 --> 20:53.666
So, sir?

20:55.737 --> 20:57.428
- The doctor's got it wrong.

20:57.428 --> 20:58.602
No, let me rephrase that.

20:58.602 --> 21:01.777
Wrong, it's harsh.

21:01.777 --> 21:03.158
- But he has been poisoned.

21:03.158 --> 21:05.056
- Oh, I'm convinced.

21:05.056 --> 21:06.023
Though not with thallium.

21:06.023 --> 21:07.335
Sasha was wrong about that.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.855
Having seen the data
the doctors gathered,

21:10.855 --> 21:13.513
it's clear they scanned
him with a Geiger counter.

21:13.513 --> 21:15.964
That would've picked up thallium

21:15.964 --> 21:19.519
and/or other heavy metals
common in poisoning

21:19.519 --> 21:20.520
had they been there.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.315
- But they weren't.

21:22.315 --> 21:23.765
- No.

21:23.765 --> 21:25.525
What a Geiger counter misses

21:25.525 --> 21:27.872
are things called
alpha emitters.

21:27.872 --> 21:29.357
And suddenly that
explained everything

21:29.357 --> 21:30.806
including the hair loss.

21:33.153 --> 21:36.053
Sasha Litvinenko
has been poisoned,

21:36.053 --> 21:39.401
in the middle of London, in
the middle of a working day,

21:39.401 --> 21:41.852
with a radioactive substance.

21:43.060 --> 21:44.924
Now, precisely which
one it is hard to say.

21:46.995 --> 21:48.479
- How do we find out?

21:48.479 --> 21:50.550
- By getting a sample
of Sasha's urine

21:50.550 --> 21:53.312
down to the atomic weapons
establishment in Aldermaston.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.520
It's the only place
in the country

21:54.520 --> 21:56.315
that can run the analysis.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.764
Get it down there
first thing tomorrow,

21:57.764 --> 21:59.214
get priority clearance,

21:59.214 --> 22:01.320
and I'd say you'd have
feedback within a day or two.

22:03.770 --> 22:07.602
A day or two may be all
poor Sasha has left.

22:07.602 --> 22:10.294
[pensive music]

22:20.718 --> 22:21.961
- Turn right here a sec.

22:22.962 --> 22:26.448
[pensive music continues]

22:33.766 --> 22:36.527
[car door slams]

22:53.924 --> 22:56.478
You got it too or is it just me?

22:57.617 --> 22:58.411
The guilt.

22:59.792 --> 23:02.208
The guy's giving us the
final days of his life.

23:03.761 --> 23:05.384
The one person who
should be with him

23:05.384 --> 23:07.696
is stuck in a corridor
on a plastic chair.

23:09.077 --> 23:10.699
- Well, there's only
one way to stop yourself

23:10.699 --> 23:11.976
feeling like that, Brent.

23:15.083 --> 23:16.395
Catch the bastards.

23:25.783 --> 23:28.441
[pensive music]

23:35.655 --> 23:39.176
[pensive music continues]

23:45.562 --> 23:49.082
[pensive music continues]

23:51.878 --> 23:53.708
- Go straight through.

24:02.233 --> 24:04.028
- Right, congratulations.

24:04.028 --> 24:05.616
What you are working
on is the first ever

24:05.616 --> 24:08.136
murder investigation where
nobody's actually died.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.693
In all seriousness, while
Mr. Litvinenko is alive,

24:13.693 --> 24:16.247
we have the best possible
witness we could hope for.

24:16.247 --> 24:18.111
Our two friends from
homicide have begun

24:18.111 --> 24:20.113
a process of talking
to the victim.

24:20.113 --> 24:21.632
They made a strong start.

24:21.632 --> 24:24.463
Let's now build on
their findings, please.

24:24.463 --> 24:29.433
What's dangerous here
are the unknowables.

24:29.433 --> 24:31.987
Useful though Litvinenko's
statements have been so far,

24:31.987 --> 24:34.680
we do not yet know who it
was that tried to kill him.

24:34.680 --> 24:37.130
We do not know what with,
we do not know where,

24:37.130 --> 24:38.407
we do not know why.

24:39.823 --> 24:44.379
All we can be certain
about is that a substance,

24:44.379 --> 24:46.692
an unidentified poison,

24:46.692 --> 24:49.211
has been deployed
in Central London,

24:49.211 --> 24:51.938
the busiest square
mile in Europe.

24:53.388 --> 24:56.322
And that that substance has
the power to kill people.

24:58.669 --> 25:01.223
If we needed something
to focus our thinking,

25:02.570 --> 25:04.019
let it be that, please.

25:06.159 --> 25:08.783
Right, back to it.

25:16.307 --> 25:17.136
- Sir.

25:18.551 --> 25:21.347
I appreciate that this is
now a counterterrorism job,

25:21.347 --> 25:25.834
but I just wanted to say
that Jim and I built up

25:25.834 --> 25:30.494
a very close personal
dialogue with Mr. Litvinenko.

25:30.494 --> 25:31.702
Not to mention the fact-

25:31.702 --> 25:33.532
- It's not a
counter-terrorism job, Brent.

25:33.532 --> 25:34.878
It's a joint inquiry.

25:34.878 --> 25:36.362
- Right.

25:36.362 --> 25:38.675
- [Clive] And there's
a clock on this, yes.

25:38.675 --> 25:41.643
- We just owe it to the bloke
to finish what we started.

25:43.749 --> 25:45.682
- Well, you better
get on with it then.

25:48.788 --> 25:52.343
[tape recorder buzzes]

25:52.343 --> 25:57.348
- The time is now 14:41 on
the 19th of November, 2006.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.387
The same persons still present.

26:01.387 --> 26:02.733
Also present...

26:02.733 --> 26:04.217
- My name is Nina Tapper.

26:04.217 --> 26:06.634
I'll be acting as interpreter
for Mr. Litvinenko.

26:07.842 --> 26:10.016
- What I need now,
Sasha, is for you

26:10.016 --> 26:14.296
to complete your account
of the 1st of November.

26:14.296 --> 26:15.574
This important day.

26:19.060 --> 26:24.065
- I leave Itsu and make phone
call to arrange next meeting.

26:26.515 --> 26:28.794
- [Brent] Scaramella wasn't
your only meeting that day.

26:28.794 --> 26:30.071
- No.

26:30.071 --> 26:33.419
I agreed to meet old
colleague from KGB.

26:34.938 --> 26:37.009
He's in London on
family holiday.

26:38.458 --> 26:41.807
He's staying at Millennium
Hotel, Grosvenor Square.

26:41.807 --> 26:43.049
- And his name?

26:43.049 --> 26:44.533
- Andrey Lugovoy.

26:47.571 --> 26:49.953
He say, "Hurry Sasha,
meet now, meet early.

26:50.816 --> 26:52.783
We not have much time."

26:53.991 --> 26:56.131
- [Brent] He brought
the meeting forward.

26:56.131 --> 26:57.754
- Yes.

26:57.754 --> 27:02.759
Yes, because they're
going for football match.

27:04.588 --> 27:06.901
Arsenal and CSKA Moscow.

27:07.971 --> 27:10.318
- They being Mr
Lugovoy and his family.

27:10.318 --> 27:11.630
- No.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.115
Lugovoy and his associate.

27:17.394 --> 27:18.395
This name...

27:24.090 --> 27:25.644
I not remember this name.

27:28.301 --> 27:29.924
- You didn't know
the second guy.

27:33.341 --> 27:34.169
- Kovtun.

27:34.169 --> 27:35.170
I remember.

27:35.170 --> 27:36.344
Dmitry Kovtun.

27:40.313 --> 27:41.383
I go hotel.

27:42.799 --> 27:44.007
I walk inside.

27:46.147 --> 27:47.493
I see Lugovoy.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.709
[speaking in foreign language]

27:56.709 --> 27:58.746
- Lugovoy was
waiting in the foyer.

28:00.333 --> 28:03.785
- He told me to
go into hotel bar.

28:05.511 --> 28:06.719
The waiter come.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.206
Ask for me to have drink.

28:11.206 --> 28:14.865
But before I can say yes,
Lugovoy says, "No, no.

28:16.971 --> 28:17.903
No more drinks.

28:17.903 --> 28:19.870
We're only here short while."

28:21.630 --> 28:23.702
The waiter goes away.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.705
- So you don't have a drink?

28:26.705 --> 28:30.709
[speaking in foreign language]

28:33.539 --> 28:35.023
- Lugovoy told him
there's no need

28:35.023 --> 28:36.715
to order a drink of your own.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.234
After all, there is plenty
of tea left in the pot.

28:41.064 --> 28:43.652
- So, you drank
the leftover tea.

28:47.587 --> 28:48.934
How much?

28:48.934 --> 28:49.866
- Three mouthfuls.

28:51.557 --> 28:53.317
The tea is cold, I not like.

28:55.078 --> 28:57.183
- And Kovtun.

28:58.081 --> 28:59.668
Where's he in all this?

29:01.601 --> 29:04.225
- Would you point this fan?

29:04.225 --> 29:05.813
- Yes, of course.

29:16.444 --> 29:17.963
- Kovtun come from his room.

29:17.963 --> 29:18.791
Say hello.

29:19.688 --> 29:22.761
Talk about big business scheme.

29:24.763 --> 29:28.007
Say I can make money in UK.

29:29.388 --> 29:32.391
If the police ask
questions, you pay them off.

29:32.391 --> 29:33.323
He's arrogant.

29:34.876 --> 29:37.706
I said, "No, you not
understand United Kingdom.

29:38.915 --> 29:41.780
Here, policemen does
not take bribes.

29:44.748 --> 29:49.753
Here, more than any
country, policeman is good.

29:52.411 --> 29:54.378
You can trust with your life.

30:00.902 --> 30:03.318
- What else can you
give me on Lugovoy?

30:08.910 --> 30:11.154
I know you're tired, Sasha,

30:12.327 --> 30:14.847
but you're right,
this is crucial now.

30:16.711 --> 30:19.507
I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't push you on this.

30:24.581 --> 30:28.481
[speaking in foreign language]

30:31.346 --> 30:34.833
- [Nina] In his house, Mr.
Litvinenko has many papers,

30:34.833 --> 30:37.352
all of which he's made sure
to arrange very carefully.

30:37.352 --> 30:42.012
[speaking in foreign language]

30:42.012 --> 30:43.876
- [Nina] In the bottom
drawer of his desk,

30:43.876 --> 30:45.464
you will find a file on Lugovoy.

30:47.155 --> 30:49.054
[siren wailing]

30:49.054 --> 30:49.848
- Sir.

31:19.325 --> 31:20.948
- I found 'em.

31:20.948 --> 31:24.675
Turns out he's an ex platoon
commander in the KGB,

31:24.675 --> 31:27.575
and involved in state security.

31:27.575 --> 31:29.853
- The Russian foreign
intelligence service

31:29.853 --> 31:32.614
today denied having anything
to do with what happened

31:32.614 --> 31:35.031
to a critic of President Putin

31:35.031 --> 31:37.274
when he apparently
visited a sushi bar.

31:37.274 --> 31:39.104
Peter Marshall reports.

31:39.104 --> 31:41.209
- [Peter] The victim,
the former Russian spy,

31:41.209 --> 31:45.213
Alexander Litvinenko, a defector
whose poisoning in London

31:45.213 --> 31:48.182
has left him in hospital
fighting for his life.

31:49.528 --> 31:50.770
- [Wife] This is you.

31:50.770 --> 31:52.600
- [Peter] Litvinenko
now joins a growing list

31:52.600 --> 31:55.016
of those who've been
victims of assassination.

31:55.016 --> 31:56.880
- It's exciting.

31:56.880 --> 31:59.055
- That's one word for it.

31:59.055 --> 32:02.748
- [Peter] All vehement and
critics of Vladimir Putin.

32:02.748 --> 32:05.130
- [Speaker] A person of
his standing, I thank...

32:08.305 --> 32:09.410
- [Wife] Hey.

32:22.009 --> 32:23.286
- [Clive] Mornin' Floppy.

32:23.286 --> 32:24.459
- Mornin' Guv.

32:27.531 --> 32:30.603
[cell phone ringing]

32:37.265 --> 32:38.715
- Timmons.

32:38.715 --> 32:41.097
- Detective, this is James
Cairns calling from Aldermaston.

32:41.097 --> 32:43.685
I have a result for you
on the urine sample.

32:43.685 --> 32:44.479
- Go on.

32:45.515 --> 32:47.586
- The sample
contains clear traces

32:47.586 --> 32:50.796
of a substance known
as Polonium 210.

32:50.796 --> 32:51.624
- Sorry?

32:51.624 --> 32:52.418
Polonium?

32:53.868 --> 32:55.974
You mean plutonium?

32:55.974 --> 32:57.216
- Polonium.

32:57.216 --> 32:58.631
It's an isotope.

32:58.631 --> 33:00.392
It's extremely rare.

33:00.392 --> 33:02.532
Almost certainly
produced in Russia.

33:02.532 --> 33:04.983
- Right, well, what does
that mean for the victim?

33:06.156 --> 33:07.778
- [James] Well, I'm
not a medical doctor.

33:07.778 --> 33:09.504
It's not my job to say.

33:09.504 --> 33:10.712
- But in your opinion.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.232
- Well, in my opinion,

33:13.232 --> 33:16.304
there's no conceivable
way that he can survive.

33:16.304 --> 33:18.686
Polonium is commonly
accepted to be

33:18.686 --> 33:20.860
the most dangerous
substance known to men.

33:47.956 --> 33:50.235
- She's gone to get some air.

34:08.425 --> 34:12.843
- Sasha always makes
life easy for me.

34:13.913 --> 34:17.641
Whatever he tells me, I believe.

34:20.334 --> 34:24.614
He tells me he
has been poisoned.

34:24.614 --> 34:25.442
I believe.

34:28.618 --> 34:31.276
He tells me this
poison will kill him.

34:34.037 --> 34:35.003
I believe.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.218
But all this time,

34:43.943 --> 34:45.290
just because I believe,

34:46.567 --> 34:48.120
does not mean I do not hope.

34:54.368 --> 34:57.025
It does not mean I
cannot hope he's wrong.

35:06.138 --> 35:07.622
- Mrs. Carter.

35:09.417 --> 35:12.903
Given we're near the end
of the interviews now,

35:12.903 --> 35:16.528
I was wondering, would you
like to come into the room,

35:16.528 --> 35:17.839
sit with Sasha?

35:22.327 --> 35:23.983
I'd like it if you said yes.

35:29.299 --> 35:34.062
- I come out of bus, I put
music in my ears, I walk home.

35:39.930 --> 35:42.347
But before I go in my door,

35:42.347 --> 35:47.145
I see my wife and son in window.

35:50.355 --> 35:52.253
They are happy.

35:53.530 --> 35:57.638
- And once doors,
you stay indoors?

36:01.055 --> 36:01.883
Did you eat?

36:03.575 --> 36:07.579
[speaking in foreign language]

36:10.409 --> 36:12.100
- Yes, I had a meal.

36:12.998 --> 36:14.517
Marina made dinner.

36:14.517 --> 36:17.278
She always makes
such excellent meals.

36:17.278 --> 36:19.625
- Later, I have pain in stomach.

36:22.456 --> 36:24.354
I have blood in mouth.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.185
I am sick.

36:29.808 --> 36:31.982
I'm poisoned, I know this.

36:33.191 --> 36:38.196
I know...

36:38.196 --> 36:41.233
I'm sorry detective, I not learn

36:41.233 --> 36:44.961
English language completely yet.

36:48.827 --> 36:53.141
But I am proud to be able
to say I am British citizen.

36:56.317 --> 36:57.905
Britain is good country.

37:01.978 --> 37:03.393
I will die, yes.

37:04.739 --> 37:06.810
But I will die a free person.

37:10.607 --> 37:12.713
My wife and son are free.

37:16.372 --> 37:20.790
I say to my son, "Remember
for the rest of your life,

37:23.965 --> 37:25.898
this country saved us."

37:37.082 --> 37:39.257
You ask me many questions.

37:42.329 --> 37:43.330
- I'm sorry.

37:46.436 --> 37:47.782
- Now I ask you,

37:52.649 --> 37:53.995
you have a wife?

37:55.549 --> 37:56.377
- I do.

37:57.551 --> 38:00.864
- [Litvinenko] You
love this woman?

38:00.864 --> 38:01.693
- I do.

38:03.419 --> 38:04.316
- Children?

38:05.248 --> 38:06.076
- Not yet.

38:08.078 --> 38:09.804
But we still hope to.

38:14.361 --> 38:17.156
- I ask request
of you inspector.

38:22.886 --> 38:25.303
I know there will be pressure

38:26.545 --> 38:27.374
from top,

38:28.685 --> 38:29.859
on the police,

38:33.518 --> 38:34.346
on you.

38:36.072 --> 38:40.248
But, I ask you your best

38:42.216 --> 38:46.324
to bring this case
to justice for me,

38:48.947 --> 38:50.224
for my family,

38:54.228 --> 38:56.334
as far as it is possible.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.165
- Sasha,

39:02.961 --> 39:04.134
I give you my word.

39:09.105 --> 39:12.350
[tape recorder buzzes]

39:22.567 --> 39:24.292
["BBC News Theme"]

39:24.292 --> 39:25.811
- [Reporter] The mystery
surrounding the poisoning

39:25.811 --> 39:28.435
of the former Russian
agent Alexander Litvinenko

39:28.435 --> 39:29.988
has deepened tonight.

39:29.988 --> 39:31.783
Doctors now say
that it's unlikely

39:31.783 --> 39:33.854
that he was poisoned
with Thallium.

39:33.854 --> 39:35.027
Mr. Litvinenko remains-

39:35.027 --> 39:37.029
- The discovery of
polonium puts this case

39:37.029 --> 39:39.791
at the top of the
Metropolitan Police agenda.

39:39.791 --> 39:42.587
I've called an emergency meeting
of the relevant agencies.

39:42.587 --> 39:45.555
- And I'll be establishing a
testing site here at the yard.

39:45.555 --> 39:47.385
- Nick's from the Health
Protection Agency.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.179
- You and your team
will all need assessing,

39:49.179 --> 39:52.976
as will anyone or anything
that's come into direct contact

39:52.976 --> 39:54.564
with the victim.

39:54.564 --> 39:56.877
- How do you mean, anything?

39:56.877 --> 39:59.949
- You, your tapes, you recording
equipment, your clothes,

39:59.949 --> 40:03.021
it will all need to be scanned
for signs of radioactivity.

40:03.021 --> 40:05.575
- Why do you think we're sitting
on this side of the table?

40:05.575 --> 40:08.578
- So if someone who's
contaminated gave you something,

40:08.578 --> 40:12.030
that object could also be
carrying traces of the...

40:12.030 --> 40:12.996
- Polonium.

40:12.996 --> 40:13.825
That's right.

40:15.965 --> 40:17.069
- Oh, sorry sir.

40:17.069 --> 40:18.312
I have to go.

40:18.312 --> 40:19.140
- Brent.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.291
- Hi.

40:32.291 --> 40:33.120
- Hey.

40:39.195 --> 40:41.266
Just taking an interest.

40:47.445 --> 40:48.894
What was that for?

40:52.104 --> 40:52.898
Brent?

41:10.847 --> 41:12.331
- Negative.

41:12.331 --> 41:14.817
[Brent sighs]

41:16.335 --> 41:18.165
- Thank you very much.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.796
- Hospital called.

Sasha's had a cardiac.

the victim's home,

42:16.361 --> 42:19.675
the Millennium Hotel, wherever
Mario Scaramella was staying.

42:19.675 --> 42:22.643
these need to be secured
as absolute priority.

42:22.643 --> 42:25.059
- How many uniforms can I get?

42:25.059 --> 42:25.853
- [Peter] How many do you need?

42:25.853 --> 42:26.854
- Oh, 50, minimum.

42:32.584 --> 42:35.518
- There are on call teams
at Belgravia and Savile Row.

42:35.518 --> 42:37.900
They can be made available
immediately tomorrow.

42:37.900 --> 42:41.110
That can double, but
let's be careful please.

42:41.110 --> 42:44.527
This is one of the
world's busiest cities.

42:44.527 --> 42:47.599
Flood the streets with uniform
and they can create a panic.

42:48.876 --> 42:52.121
Mr. Litvinenko died
at 21:21 this evening.

43:05.686 --> 43:09.103

43:22.289 --> 43:24.705

43:32.540 --> 43:36.303
- This is now a
murder investigation

43:37.684 --> 43:40.652
and there has never been a
murder investigation like it.

43:40.652 --> 43:43.034
So, let's all take a moment.

43:43.931 --> 43:45.381
Let's look around us.

43:46.900 --> 43:49.730
And let's understand
that the people

43:49.730 --> 43:52.630
sitting in this room just now

43:52.630 --> 43:56.150
are the people best
equipped to get justice

43:56.150 --> 43:58.566
for a British citizen
and his family.

44:02.709 --> 44:05.470
- What was it you told me
when we first got here?

44:08.404 --> 44:11.200
You didn't think anybody
was taking it seriously.

44:12.166 --> 44:13.443
- [Reporter] Mr. Goldfarb!

44:13.443 --> 44:14.721
- [Reporter] There he is!

44:14.721 --> 44:16.861
[indistinct chatter]

44:16.861 --> 44:18.207
- Good evening.

44:18.207 --> 44:19.277
Good evening.

44:21.244 --> 44:25.110
Two days ago, I spent
some time in the company

44:25.110 --> 44:29.494
of my friend
Alexander Litvinenko,

44:29.494 --> 44:31.289
who died this evening.

44:32.428 --> 44:35.258
Sasha asked me to
read something to you.

44:36.674 --> 44:40.298
I have the privilege
of doing this now.

44:41.679 --> 44:45.337
I would like to thank my
doctors and hospital staff,

44:45.337 --> 44:47.408
who did all they could for me.

44:48.547 --> 44:50.791
I would like to thank
the British police

44:50.791 --> 44:54.243
for pursuing my case with
vigor and professionalism.

44:55.623 --> 44:59.627
I would like to thank my
wife, Marina, who stood by me.

45:00.732 --> 45:04.702
My love for her and our
son knows no bounds.

45:05.564 --> 45:06.945
But as I lie here,

45:08.153 --> 45:12.088
I can distinctly hear
the beating of wings

45:12.088 --> 45:13.607
of the angel of death.

45:14.712 --> 45:18.129
I think therefore, that
this may be the time

45:18.129 --> 45:22.443
to say one or two things
to the person responsible.

45:24.549 --> 45:27.897
You may succeed in silencing me,

45:27.897 --> 45:31.280
but the howl of protest
from around the world

45:31.280 --> 45:35.353
will reverberate, Mr.
Putin, in your ears

45:35.353 --> 45:37.769
for the rest of your life.

45:40.185 --> 45:43.671
May God forgive you
for what you have done,

45:43.671 --> 45:48.676
not only to me, but to our
beloved Russia and its people.
