WEBVTT

00:02.674 --> 00:05.908
This is an easy one.
You love this guy.

00:05.910 --> 00:07.677
Me.

00:08.813 --> 00:12.215
Come on, he's an
underappreciated genius.

00:12.217 --> 00:14.684
Still think it's me.

00:14.686 --> 00:16.285
It's not you.

00:16.286 --> 00:18.988
Now think, there's
a car named after him.

00:18.990 --> 00:20.223
Of course there is.

00:20.225 --> 00:22.325
The Mini Cooper,
'cause it's me.

00:24.562 --> 00:26.429
How about this:

00:26.431 --> 00:28.564
he's a poor man's
Sheldon Cooper.

00:28.566 --> 00:30.199
Oh, Tesla.

00:31.002 --> 00:32.067
- Hi.
- Hey! - Hello.

00:32.070 --> 00:33.603
How'd it go?
Oh, not fun.

00:33.605 --> 00:36.772
The doctor shoved a camera
up into my sinuses.

00:36.774 --> 00:38.908
Yeah, I watched. It was like
the scary boat tunnel

00:38.910 --> 00:41.010
in <i> Willy Wonka.</i>

00:42.313 --> 00:44.380
Did they figure out what's wrong?
Yeah.

00:44.382 --> 00:45.348
It's a deviated septum.

00:45.350 --> 00:46.482
The surgery
to correct it is simple.

00:46.484 --> 00:47.683
He's gonna do it next week.

00:47.685 --> 00:49.619
Why would you have surgery?

00:49.621 --> 00:51.320
Because I can't breathe.

00:51.322 --> 00:53.823
I snore, I get sinus
infections...

00:53.825 --> 00:56.325
Yeah, back off,
he's all mine.

00:56.327 --> 00:58.594
But you don't have
a life-threatening condition.

00:58.596 --> 01:00.496
Why would you
take the risk of surgery?

01:00.498 --> 01:02.298
Sheldon, it's a routine
procedure.

01:02.300 --> 01:04.400
I've heard you complain
about his snoring.

01:04.402 --> 01:06.602
We... Yes, for the first
five or six years,

01:06.604 --> 01:08.504
but I've gotten used to it.

01:09.107 --> 01:10.506
It helps me sleep.

01:10.508 --> 01:13.176
He's like my mucus-powered
white noise machine.

01:14.412 --> 01:16.345
Sheldon, I'm gonna get
the surgery, it's no big deal.

01:16.347 --> 01:17.446
End of story.

01:17.448 --> 01:18.995
Very well.
I'm done talking about it.

01:18.995 --> 01:19.812
Thank you.

01:19.836 --> 01:21.451
I believe it was
your turn in the game.

01:21.452 --> 01:22.785
Okay.

01:24.589 --> 01:25.621
Let's see...

01:25.623 --> 01:28.391
Oh, this person is most famous

01:28.393 --> 01:29.559
for never having gotten

01:29.561 --> 01:32.495
his nose mutilated
with elective surgery

01:32.497 --> 01:34.997
and never living the rest
of his life in the shadows

01:34.999 --> 01:36.832
as a hideous, disfigured freak.

01:38.136 --> 01:40.436
I think you could
give a better clue.

01:40.438 --> 01:41.537
I don't.

01:41.539 --> 01:44.740
I'm not even sure if
that's a person or a typo.

02:28.453 --> 02:31.654
Okay, why?

02:31.656 --> 02:33.756
I'm listening to you snore.

02:33.758 --> 02:36.959
I'm wondering how
I'll ever sleep without it.

02:36.961 --> 02:39.695
If it helps you sleep,

02:39.697 --> 02:41.631
then why are you sitting here
staring at me

02:41.633 --> 02:44.000
like the albino boogeyman?

02:45.470 --> 02:47.136
Really, Leonard-- insults?

02:47.138 --> 02:48.871
After I spent two hours
in your closet,

02:48.873 --> 02:50.306
waiting for you to fall asleep?

02:53.445 --> 02:54.710
What's your problem?

02:54.712 --> 02:58.781
If the surgery is successful,
the snoring is gone.

02:58.783 --> 03:01.317
And if you die during surgery...

03:02.053 --> 03:04.687
...the snoring is gone.

03:05.757 --> 03:09.092
It sounds like either way,
I finally get some rest.

03:09.094 --> 03:11.027
I have to be honest
with you Leonard,

03:11.029 --> 03:12.695
I'm truly worried.

03:12.697 --> 03:15.598
I-I told you, there's
nothing to worry about.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.166
Well, I've been
doing some research

03:17.168 --> 03:19.702
and I've learned that
one in 700,000 people

03:19.704 --> 03:22.004
die from general anesthesia.

03:22.006 --> 03:24.707
Buddy, w... Do you realize that
that also means

03:24.709 --> 03:28.678
699,999 people don't die?

03:30.849 --> 03:32.415
I suppose that's true.

03:34.219 --> 03:36.619
You're such a glass
half-full kind of guy.

03:38.423 --> 03:40.990
I'm going to miss that.

03:43.328 --> 03:46.829
Oh, so, my, uh, parents'
40th anniversary's coming up

03:46.831 --> 03:49.031
and I can't think
of a thing to get them.

03:49.033 --> 03:50.466
Damn, can you imagine

03:50.468 --> 03:54.237
being married to someone
for 40 years?

03:57.008 --> 03:59.041
Not anymore.

04:03.181 --> 04:05.548
Anyway, any ideas on a gift?

04:05.550 --> 04:07.683
Well, what are some
of the things they like?

04:07.685 --> 04:10.086
They used to like
going to the Mumbai Symphony,

04:10.088 --> 04:12.388
but last year my mom thought
they were phoning it in.

04:12.390 --> 04:13.623
Then my dad said
based on their

04:13.625 --> 04:16.858
love life, she should know
about phoning it in.

04:17.807 --> 04:18.796
He said that to her?

04:18.820 --> 04:20.363
Well, they weren't
speaking at the time,

04:20.365 --> 04:22.198
so he had a servant
say it to her.

04:22.200 --> 04:25.334
Oh, maybe I could
make a gift for them.

04:25.336 --> 04:28.738
I know how much you guys love
the coasters I made for you.

04:31.109 --> 04:33.709
They're yours in the divorce.

04:38.049 --> 04:39.815
Hey. What're you working on?

04:39.817 --> 04:41.717
Remember when I said
if you went through

04:41.719 --> 04:45.321
with your surgery, there was a
one-in-700,000 chance of dying?

04:45.323 --> 04:47.523
Yeah...?

04:47.525 --> 04:49.225
Well, I've been
crunching the numbers,

04:49.227 --> 04:52.562
and so far, I've gotten
your probability of death

04:52.564 --> 04:54.230
all the way to a
sphincter-tightening

04:54.232 --> 04:56.799
one in 300.

04:58.336 --> 04:59.702
Great timing.

04:59.704 --> 05:02.572
My “check sphincter”
light just went on.

05:02.574 --> 05:05.374
Leonard, what if you have
an allergic reaction

05:05.376 --> 05:07.743
to the surgeon's latex gloves?
I'm not

05:07.745 --> 05:09.011
allergic to latex.

05:09.013 --> 05:10.646
Well, then why don't you
wear the rubber gloves

05:10.648 --> 05:12.281
I bought for you
to do the dishes?

05:12.283 --> 05:15.785
For the same reason I don't
wear the apron or the hair net.

05:15.787 --> 05:18.721
Fine. What about epilepsy?

05:18.723 --> 05:20.489
I don't have epilepsy, either.

05:20.491 --> 05:22.925
You don't,
but the surgeon might, hmm?

05:22.927 --> 05:26.429
And your carotid artery is just
one shaky scalpel away

05:26.431 --> 05:29.966
from becoming the dancing
fountain at Disneyland.

05:29.968 --> 05:33.336
Sheldon, do you realize that
driving is riskier than surgery?

05:33.338 --> 05:36.572
I do. I have the drive
to the hospital right here.

05:36.574 --> 05:37.907
That is if
you make it

05:37.909 --> 05:40.743
to the car without
falling down the stairs.

05:40.745 --> 05:43.779
And don't expect me to carry
you, I do that enough in life.

05:44.882 --> 05:46.716
Buddy, I-I get that
you're worried about me

05:46.718 --> 05:49.619
and I-I appreciate that,
but I'm not going to die.

05:49.621 --> 05:51.254
You don't know that.
Well...

05:51.256 --> 05:54.757
I do know that it won't
be from an asteroid strike.

05:55.994 --> 05:57.560
You know who else said that?

05:57.562 --> 05:59.562
Every cocky T. Rex
currently swimming around

05:59.564 --> 06:01.631
in the gas tank of your car.

06:02.467 --> 06:04.267
I-If there was
an asteroid strike,

06:04.269 --> 06:05.468
wouldn't you die, too?

06:05.470 --> 06:07.203
I don't know--
I'm smart and scrappy,

06:07.205 --> 06:09.538
I think I'd find a way.

06:11.242 --> 06:13.342
Tell you what--
the surgery's not for a week,

06:13.344 --> 06:14.577
I'll think about it.

06:14.579 --> 06:17.380
Thank you. And while
you're thinking about it,

06:17.382 --> 06:19.482
if you have the surgery
in Nicaragua during

06:19.484 --> 06:21.083
monsoon season,
I can practically

06:21.085 --> 06:22.485
guarantee your death.

06:27.458 --> 06:30.459
Yes. Okay.

06:30.461 --> 06:32.094
I-I understand.

06:32.096 --> 06:33.429
Of course, yes.

06:33.431 --> 06:35.464
I'll call you tomorrow.

06:35.466 --> 06:37.266
Bye.

06:37.268 --> 06:40.503
So I found this fencing school
in Burbank

06:40.505 --> 06:42.905
that has a Jedi class.

06:44.842 --> 06:46.609
And if you're cool
being the only adults there,

06:46.611 --> 06:48.878
they said they are.

06:49.814 --> 06:51.480
Dude, my parents just split up.

06:51.482 --> 06:54.350
What?!
Uh, that was my dad on the phone.

06:54.352 --> 06:56.285
He moved out.

06:56.287 --> 06:59.188
Oh, my God, I... I'm sorry.

06:59.190 --> 07:02.091
I mean, if you're not up to it,
we don't have to go out,

07:02.093 --> 07:04.060
we can just hang here.
No,

07:04.062 --> 07:06.228
it's fine.
It's not that big a deal.

07:06.230 --> 07:08.531
As long as they're happy,
I'm happy.

07:08.533 --> 07:10.766
And when I get to see them
for the holidays,

07:10.768 --> 07:12.835
I'll get to celebrate
Diwali twice--

07:12.837 --> 07:14.437
one at each house.

07:16.774 --> 07:18.941
That's double the Diwali.

07:19.877 --> 07:21.177
You sure you're okay?

07:21.179 --> 07:22.278
I'm okay.

07:22.280 --> 07:23.512
You don't look okay.

07:23.514 --> 07:26.015
How can I be okay?
I come from a broken home.

07:28.653 --> 07:31.087
The doctor said I should be
out of surgery by 10:00.

07:31.089 --> 07:32.555
Okay.

07:32.557 --> 07:36.325
And Sheldon really believes
we're at a public swimming pool?

07:37.462 --> 07:40.696
He was so busy figuring out
how many parts per million

07:40.698 --> 07:43.499
of urine we'd be floating around
in, he didn't even question it.

07:44.769 --> 07:48.070
18 parts per million.

07:49.307 --> 07:51.407
And he's still doing it.

07:51.409 --> 07:54.110
Don't worry about that.
I'm happy to take you to work.

07:54.112 --> 07:55.544
Well, thank you.

07:55.546 --> 07:58.981
And Leonard never lets me have
French toast sticks in the car.

07:58.983 --> 08:01.083
I can't have syrupy fingers,

08:01.085 --> 08:04.053
but he can do the backstroke
in a toilet bowl.

08:05.356 --> 08:07.790
It's nice they're
getting exercise.

08:08.860 --> 08:11.060
Although now that
I think about it,

08:11.062 --> 08:13.229
Leonard would never
go swimming in public

08:13.231 --> 08:15.831
without his swim shirt.

08:16.868 --> 08:18.000
I'm sure he brought it.

08:18.002 --> 08:20.069
No, but last year,
at Magic Mountain,

08:20.071 --> 08:21.737
he got such a bad sunburn,

08:21.739 --> 08:24.507
we had to cut him out of it.

08:25.710 --> 08:27.743
He probably got a new one.
Finish your breakfast.

08:27.745 --> 08:29.645
Look, there's an entire
section of my dashboard

08:29.647 --> 08:31.447
that doesn't have
any syrup on it.

08:32.316 --> 08:35.251
You're acting odd. Why?

08:35.253 --> 08:38.386
I'm odd all the time,
everyone knows that.

08:38.389 --> 08:39.855
Just last night,

08:39.857 --> 08:42.991
I tried to see how many fava
beans I could fit in my mouth.

08:44.462 --> 08:45.661
Tell me the truth.

08:45.663 --> 08:48.264
28.
Come on.

08:48.266 --> 08:51.000
Fifty-six.

08:51.002 --> 08:52.234
Amy!

08:52.236 --> 08:54.703
What's going on?

08:54.705 --> 08:56.639
All right.

08:56.641 --> 08:57.807
Don't get upset, but...

08:57.809 --> 09:01.110
an earlier appointment
opened up for Leonard

09:01.112 --> 09:04.780
and he's getting
the surgery right now.

09:08.419 --> 09:10.619
I see.

09:15.693 --> 09:17.126
Take me to Leonard.

09:17.128 --> 09:19.228
Just go to work,
he'll be fine.

09:19.230 --> 09:22.064
Amy, he's my best friend,
and if you don't take me,

09:22.066 --> 09:23.632
I'm going there anyway.

09:23.634 --> 09:26.735
Fine.

09:26.737 --> 09:29.338
It's sweet that you
care about him so much.

09:29.340 --> 09:30.573
I do.

09:30.575 --> 09:32.241
And I wouldn't
be able to forgive myself,

09:32.243 --> 09:34.543
if something happened to him
and I wasn't at his bedside

09:34.545 --> 09:36.812
to say, “I told you so.”

09:53.504 --> 09:54.770
Hello.

09:54.772 --> 09:56.538
We had a really nice swim.

09:56.540 --> 09:57.806
Oh, stop it.

09:57.808 --> 10:01.243
I assume this medical
center's already treated

10:01.245 --> 10:04.279
the burns on your bottom
from the recent pants fire.

10:05.516 --> 10:07.716
'Cause I'm a liar, liar?

10:07.718 --> 10:09.818
That's for the fire marshal
to determine.

10:11.822 --> 10:12.854
You had to tell him?

10:12.856 --> 10:14.389
He wore me down.

10:14.391 --> 10:15.724
And I was distracted.

10:15.726 --> 10:18.727
He has on
extra baby powder today.

10:18.729 --> 10:20.195
Is he okay?

10:20.197 --> 10:22.197
He's still in surgery.

10:23.534 --> 10:25.400
Very well.

10:25.402 --> 10:27.836
He's gonna be all right.

10:27.838 --> 10:30.005
That is sticky.

10:31.842 --> 10:33.508
Come on,
let's talk about something

10:33.510 --> 10:34.676
other than the surgery.

10:34.678 --> 10:36.278
That's a good idea.

10:36.280 --> 10:40.649
Penny, did you and Leonard ever
discuss funeral arrangements?

10:41.885 --> 10:44.620
I think she meant
something a little happier.

10:44.622 --> 10:49.057
I suppose we could try
to make it a celebration,

10:49.059 --> 10:51.393
but he died so young.

10:55.132 --> 10:56.732
Knock, knock.
Hi.

10:56.734 --> 10:57.733
Hey.
What brings you by?

10:57.735 --> 10:59.401
Oh...

10:59.403 --> 11:02.237
muffin much.

11:03.073 --> 11:05.173
Told you-- not funny.

11:05.175 --> 11:07.175
He's just not laughing

11:07.177 --> 11:11.747
because he's feeling...
<i>blue</i> berry.

11:12.750 --> 11:16.318
Tough crowd.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.853
I'm sorry.

11:17.855 --> 11:19.588
This is very sweet. Thanks.

11:19.590 --> 11:20.722
So, how you doing?

11:20.724 --> 11:21.957
Better. I guess

11:21.959 --> 11:24.292
the news just hit me
a lot harder than I expected.

11:24.294 --> 11:25.661
Well, of course.

11:25.663 --> 11:28.096
I would be devastated
if my parents split up.

11:28.098 --> 11:31.533
Why? Your father barely
speaks to your mother.

11:31.535 --> 11:32.968
Well, at least
he stuck around,

11:32.970 --> 11:34.803
not like your dad,
who just took off.

11:34.805 --> 11:38.106
As you can see, we're
here to cheer you up.

11:39.176 --> 11:40.809
Sorry, Raj.

11:40.811 --> 11:42.511
Do you have any sense of
what happened with your folks?

11:42.513 --> 11:46.481
I think, over time, they started
to resent each other,

11:46.483 --> 11:47.983
and instead of talking
about the things

11:47.985 --> 11:49.951
that bothered them,
they kept it bottled up,

11:49.953 --> 11:51.953
and the hate just grew.

11:51.955 --> 11:54.790
It's a shame they spent
all that time unhappy.

11:54.792 --> 11:56.692
But sometimes,

11:56.694 --> 11:59.327
there's <i> muffin</i>
you can do about it.

12:01.131 --> 12:03.498
You get it, right?

12:07.237 --> 12:09.438
Oh, it's nice
you got him that.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.206
Oh, this isn't
for Leonard, no.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.809
Amy bought it for me.

12:15.379 --> 12:18.947
Stubbed his toe on the
revolving door on the way in.

12:18.949 --> 12:21.717
You know those confounded
things make me dizzy.

12:21.719 --> 12:24.886
Who told you
to keep going around?

12:24.888 --> 12:26.855
There was a large
plant in the lobby.

12:26.857 --> 12:28.824
It kept looking
like the outside.

12:29.827 --> 12:31.493
Okay, listen,
when Leonard comes out,

12:31.495 --> 12:33.061
he is not gonna feel great,

12:33.063 --> 12:35.230
so, please don't
give him a hard time.

12:35.232 --> 12:36.431
Penny has a good point.

12:36.433 --> 12:38.467
This is like the man
in the supermarket

12:38.469 --> 12:40.135
with the goiter on his neck.

12:40.137 --> 12:43.038
Whatever you're thinking,
just keep it to yourself.

12:43.040 --> 12:46.508
It was like a grapefruit.

12:46.510 --> 12:48.343
And I'm sure he knew that

12:48.345 --> 12:51.346
before you held
a grapefruit up next to it.

12:51.348 --> 12:53.115
Well, I'm not
making any promises.

12:53.117 --> 12:56.084
Not only did Leonard take what
I feel is an unnecessary risk,

12:56.086 --> 12:57.319
he deceived me.

12:57.321 --> 12:58.820
Okay, the reason
he deceived you is

12:58.822 --> 13:00.489
you were being
a pain in the ass.

13:00.491 --> 13:02.724
The reason I was being
a pain in the B is

13:02.726 --> 13:04.960
because I was worried about
him, and no one else was.

13:04.962 --> 13:06.728
Really? You won't
even say “A”?

13:06.730 --> 13:08.730
You bet your
sweet B I won't.

13:08.732 --> 13:10.499
Obviously, I care
about Leonard.

13:10.501 --> 13:13.034
I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life with him.

13:13.036 --> 13:14.736
And I'm not?

13:17.574 --> 13:19.040
It's an earthquake.

13:19.042 --> 13:20.275
I knew it.

13:20.277 --> 13:21.977
Sheldon, it was
just a little tremor.

13:21.979 --> 13:24.880
A little tremor that turns
routine sinus surgery

13:24.882 --> 13:27.816
into a frontal
lobotomy.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.721
Oh, I don't care
for this at all.

13:32.723 --> 13:35.423
Oh, I need to
see he's okay.

13:35.425 --> 13:37.225
Sheldon, you can't
go back there.

13:37.227 --> 13:39.027
Try and stop me!

13:41.098 --> 13:42.964
Are you okay?

13:42.966 --> 13:45.100
Why didn't you stop me?!

13:47.638 --> 13:49.471
Can I tell you
something?

13:49.473 --> 13:51.807
This whole thing
with Raj's parents

13:51.809 --> 13:54.342
just got me
a little worried about us.

13:54.344 --> 13:56.945
What are you talking about?
We're fine.

13:56.947 --> 13:57.979
And Raj's parents

13:57.981 --> 14:00.949
probably split up
because of Raj.

14:00.951 --> 14:02.617
What?!

14:02.619 --> 14:05.320
They always say the children
aren't to blame, but...

14:05.322 --> 14:08.223
Come on.

14:10.661 --> 14:12.627
I'm not joking, Howie.

14:12.629 --> 14:14.262
You heard what he said
about his parents.

14:14.264 --> 14:16.464
It was the little things
they kept bottled up.

14:16.466 --> 14:18.934
I don't want that
to happen to us.

14:18.936 --> 14:21.069
How can I convince you it won't?

14:21.071 --> 14:24.673
Well, is there anything about me
you're keeping inside?

14:24.675 --> 14:26.575
I'm not answering that.

14:26.577 --> 14:29.644
It's a trap.

14:31.014 --> 14:33.114
So there <i> are</i> things
you don't like.

14:33.116 --> 14:36.117
And here I am in the trap.

14:37.621 --> 14:39.521
You just keep talking.

14:39.523 --> 14:42.023
I'm gonna chew my leg off.

14:42.025 --> 14:44.226
Just tell me one thing
that bothers you,

14:44.228 --> 14:45.794
and I promise I won't get mad.

14:45.796 --> 14:48.964
Okay. The truth is...

14:48.966 --> 14:51.099
sometimes... you're too...

14:51.101 --> 14:53.101
beautiful.

14:53.103 --> 14:54.703
Oh.

14:54.705 --> 14:57.138
Howie, be serious.

14:57.140 --> 14:59.107
Okay, okay.

14:59.109 --> 15:01.376
I really don't like

15:01.378 --> 15:03.612
how your wings poke me
when we sleep

15:03.614 --> 15:06.448
'cause you're an angel.

15:07.985 --> 15:10.118
Okay, fine,
maybe it was a bad idea.

15:10.120 --> 15:12.854
I just don't think the secret
to a happy marriage

15:12.856 --> 15:15.390
is going out of our way
to criticize each other.

15:15.392 --> 15:18.693
Although, there are ways
to improve our communication.

15:18.695 --> 15:21.630
One thing I learned when
I was in couples therapy was...

15:21.632 --> 15:22.864
Who were you

15:22.866 --> 15:24.032
in couples therapy with?

15:24.034 --> 15:26.201
Not important.

15:26.203 --> 15:28.436
Was it your mom?

15:28.438 --> 15:30.038
Not important.

15:30.040 --> 15:32.574
It was your mom.

15:32.576 --> 15:35.810
Anyway, the therapist had us
tell each other

15:35.812 --> 15:38.480
what we loved about one another.

15:38.482 --> 15:40.215
Oh, that's so sweet!

15:40.217 --> 15:41.883
I want to do that.

15:41.885 --> 15:43.218
All right.

15:43.220 --> 15:45.153
Okay, um...

15:45.155 --> 15:48.156
I love that you make me laugh.

15:48.158 --> 15:49.891
Thank you.

15:49.893 --> 15:54.729
And I love that you're strong
and independent.

15:54.731 --> 15:57.799
And yet, I still love
when you hold a door for me.

15:57.801 --> 16:01.703
I love that I'm kind of a slob
around here, and...

16:01.705 --> 16:03.939
you're okay with that.

16:06.743 --> 16:08.944
Uh-huh.

16:10.213 --> 16:13.148
And I love that I work
and do all the cleaning,

16:13.150 --> 16:15.517
and you're okay with that.

16:15.519 --> 16:17.986
See, I am.

16:17.988 --> 16:20.055
Isn't this great?

16:23.093 --> 16:24.426
Come on, smile.

16:24.428 --> 16:26.394
This is gonna be
my Christmas card.

16:31.301 --> 16:34.669
You know this is
all your fault.

16:34.671 --> 16:38.173
How is it my fault?

16:38.175 --> 16:40.108
I told you not to
get the surgery.

16:40.110 --> 16:43.545
Okay, first of all,
the surgery was a success,

16:43.547 --> 16:45.981
and secondly,
I didn't even want you there.

16:45.983 --> 16:49.684
Wow. I don't know
which hurts worse--

16:49.686 --> 16:51.853
my nose or my heart.

16:52.990 --> 16:54.356
Well, I'm done
speaking to you.

16:54.358 --> 16:55.490
Don't be like that.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.492
You two need to
talk this out.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.828
Yeah, 'cause
you sound really funny.

17:02.232 --> 17:04.898
Sheldon, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about the surgery,

17:04.901 --> 17:06.935
but you were worried
about nothing.

17:06.936 --> 17:09.170
Oh, you're hardly
out of the woods, no.

17:09.172 --> 17:12.007
You still run the risk of
infection, a blood clot,

17:12.009 --> 17:14.376
the possibility that
an inattentive surgeon

17:14.377 --> 17:17.311
let a barn spider
lay eggs in your nose.

17:19.182 --> 17:21.950
The minute you sneeze web,
I'm moving out.

17:21.952 --> 17:24.452
I never thought
I'd say these words,

17:24.454 --> 17:26.654
but come on, nose spider!

17:28.358 --> 17:29.290
Who are you kidding?

17:29.292 --> 17:30.492
You were so panicked

17:30.494 --> 17:32.227
Leonard was gonna die,
you'll never leave him.

17:32.229 --> 17:34.262
Sheldon will move out
eventually.

17:34.264 --> 17:36.731
Yeah, once he figures out
how to work a door.

17:37.934 --> 17:41.770
I was not panicked, and I am
not overly attached to Leonard.

17:41.772 --> 17:43.938
You were so worried
that you smashed your face

17:43.940 --> 17:45.106
trying to check on me.

17:45.108 --> 17:46.574
You <i> love</i> me.

17:47.778 --> 17:49.077
Yeah. Tell me

17:49.079 --> 17:50.578
those aren't the
words of a man

17:50.580 --> 17:52.614
with a spider eating its
way through his brain.

17:52.616 --> 17:55.417
Amy, you're a neuroscientist.

17:55.419 --> 17:58.086
Crack his skull open,
spray some Raid in there.

18:00.757 --> 18:03.024
I love that you take pride
in your looks,

18:03.026 --> 18:04.025
even when I have

18:04.027 --> 18:05.326
to pee in the morning,

18:05.328 --> 18:08.129
and you're in there
spending an hour on your hair.

18:08.131 --> 18:12.567
I love that you're too good
to pee in the kitchen sink.

18:12.569 --> 18:15.170
I love
that you have the confidence

18:15.172 --> 18:19.207
to speak, even without giving it
an ounce of thought.

18:20.177 --> 18:22.811
And I love how your hair
is always on the soap.

18:22.813 --> 18:25.380
It's like washing myself
with a hamster.

18:26.917 --> 18:29.918
Hey, guys.
Sorry I am so late.

18:29.920 --> 18:32.954
I was on the phone
with my mother.

18:32.956 --> 18:33.988
Oh, how is she?

18:33.990 --> 18:35.123
Pretty good.

18:35.125 --> 18:37.158
She bought the book
<i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>

18:37.160 --> 18:40.495
and used it to set my father's
Mercedes on fire.

18:42.165 --> 18:45.600
So, what's up with you guys?

18:45.602 --> 18:48.470
We're just saying all the things
we love about each other.

18:48.472 --> 18:51.406
Oh, like you and I
did at couples therapy.

19:04.016 --> 19:05.215
Ooh, what'd you get?

19:05.217 --> 19:07.450
Oh, I ordered it
before your surgery.

19:07.452 --> 19:11.087
It's the urn I was going
to put you in.

19:12.124 --> 19:13.423
Okay, that's morbid.

19:13.425 --> 19:14.691
Send it back.

19:14.693 --> 19:19.162
I can't send it back--
I had it engraved.

19:19.164 --> 19:22.766
“Here lie the ashes
of Leonard Hofstadter.

19:22.768 --> 19:27.203
He thought he was right,
but his roommate knew better."

19:28.973 --> 19:30.507
That's funny.

19:30.509 --> 19:32.509
Boy, I'm gonna miss
these painkillers.

19:33.911 --> 19:35.812
Hey, why did you get two?

19:35.814 --> 19:38.815
"I'm with stupid."
Oh, that one's mine.
