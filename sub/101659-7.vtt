[shower door opens]

00:11.845 --> 00:13.012
-Oh!
-[giggles]

00:18.560 --> 00:21.563
We can't both shower
at the same time, Lea.

00:21.646 --> 00:24.315
One of us would
block the steam of water for the other.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.735
Oh, Shaun, this is not
for the purpose of cleanliness.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.320
This is for the purpose
of having sex with you.

00:31.031 --> 00:31.865
Oh.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.409
N… No. No.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.953
It would be inconvenient,
possibly dangerous.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.205
Soap might get into difficult places.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.999
If we leaned against the shower handle,

00:41.082 --> 00:44.294
we could scald ourselves.
Bottles could be disarranged.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.337
It was just a thought.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.381
It was a bad thought.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.925
I'm surprised.
You're such an intelligent person.

00:52.802 --> 00:55.346
I'll… Reset your alarm.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.603
[Dr. Lim] It's a three-day weekend
and a full moon.

01:01.686 --> 01:03.104
People are gonna do stupid things.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.940
I'm asking everyone
to take an extra trauma call in the ER.

01:06.024 --> 01:08.109
Make yourselves available
if you're needed.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.277
Questions?

01:10.570 --> 01:11.821
How'd you get the bruise?

01:11.905 --> 01:13.198
First casualty of the full moon.

01:13.281 --> 01:16.409
I smacked my head on a cupboard door
while reaching for my coffee mug.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.452
Any other questions?

01:17.535 --> 01:20.413
Why is there a Subaru
in your parking space?

01:20.830 --> 01:22.082
Because it's my car.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.041
You have a car?

01:23.124 --> 01:25.460
You're gonna be seeing a lot of it.
I sold the Ducati.

01:25.543 --> 01:27.337
-What? No.
-It just wasn't practical.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.797
Is it already gone? Because…

01:28.880 --> 01:31.174
A guy from Craigslist snatched it up.

01:31.257 --> 01:34.093
Any other questions…
Not dealing with the bike?

01:36.346 --> 01:37.764
It wasn't that much of a bruise.

01:37.847 --> 01:38.890
[cellphone chimes]

01:38.973 --> 01:41.392
But the doctor at the ski resort told us

01:41.476 --> 01:43.102
I might develop a hematoma?

01:43.186 --> 01:45.563
It's not unusual,
but it'll need to be drained.

01:46.314 --> 01:49.234
I see you were treated
for melanoma six years ago,

01:49.317 --> 01:51.236
and, more recently, breast cancer.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.570
Hence the ski trip.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.155
A celebration.

01:54.906 --> 01:57.283
One year cancer-free.
Also five years cancer-free.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.576
[cellphone chimes]

02:00.245 --> 02:03.581
I don't suppose a long needle
will be involved in this?

02:03.957 --> 02:05.750
Your hematoma extends pretty deep,

02:05.834 --> 02:07.502
so the needle will have to be long.

02:07.585 --> 02:08.628
But it's over quickly.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.214
Sorry, I have to intervene
before this deal goes south.

02:11.297 --> 02:12.715
You don't mind if I step out?

02:14.676 --> 02:17.303
Would you like us to wait
for your husband to come back?

02:18.012 --> 02:19.013
No.

02:19.305 --> 02:20.390
Let's go ahead.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.229
[Dr. Reznick] How do you get
frostbite in San Jose?

02:26.312 --> 02:27.355
Cryotherapy accident.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.274
I stayed in the booth a little too long.

02:29.357 --> 02:31.818
I was going to stand outside
for the full three minutes,

02:31.901 --> 02:33.236
-but he said…
-I said, "No need."

02:33.319 --> 02:35.071
I'd set the stopwatch on my phone,

02:35.155 --> 02:37.615
after which, my thoughts
immediately drifted, and…

02:37.699 --> 02:39.576
I came back to find him
frozen in carbonite.

02:39.659 --> 02:40.577
[chuckles]

02:40.660 --> 02:42.871
You know, I'm more worried
about the fever.

02:42.954 --> 02:44.831
Was the cryotherapy
meant to treat something?

02:44.914 --> 02:45.999
No. Routine self-care.

02:46.082 --> 02:48.376
We've made life extension
part of our health regime…

02:48.459 --> 02:51.129
Supplements, meditation, exercise.

02:51.212 --> 02:53.006
Three of my gaming apps have gone viral.

02:53.089 --> 02:55.884
I'm lucky enough to afford
basically whatever I want,

02:55.967 --> 02:57.927
so I spend it on my health.

02:58.011 --> 03:01.472
No, I figure fever, must be an infection.

03:01.556 --> 03:04.517
Well, I know that frostbite
can make you vulnerable.

03:04.601 --> 03:08.104
It just… It didn't seem severe enough to…

03:09.480 --> 03:11.900
Oh, sorry. I feel a little queasy.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.234
Aah!

03:13.318 --> 03:14.402

[theme music playing]

03:37.550 --> 03:39.802
No. No. Why do people hate wind farms?

03:39.886 --> 03:41.596
Everyone thinks they're noisy.

03:41.679 --> 03:43.473
This could make a turbine sound as quiet

03:43.556 --> 03:45.016
as a page turning in a library.

03:45.099 --> 03:46.517
That's not worth our investing in?

03:46.601 --> 03:48.061
Did you even look… Hold on.

03:48.144 --> 03:49.771
Anything I need to know?

03:49.854 --> 03:50.980
Hematoma's drained.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.982
We're sending a sample
to Pathology… Routine.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.651
Should have it back sometime tomorrow.

03:54.734 --> 03:55.985
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.780
I couldn't help overhearing a little.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.531
Are you a venture capitalist?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.452
The only people who ask me if I'm a VC

04:04.535 --> 04:07.163
are people who want a VC
to invest in their project.

04:08.873 --> 04:12.710
Maybe, after we get your wife
healthy again, we could talk?

04:12.794 --> 04:15.463
Call whenever you're ready.
My life is listening to ideas.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.423
If it's good, I'll run it by
my two partners.

04:17.507 --> 04:20.718
If it's really good, we'll take
a 30% equity position in your company.

04:22.804 --> 04:23.805
Yeah.

04:24.389 --> 04:27.016
You're the one who wanted us
to get into clean technology.

04:28.851 --> 04:30.853
I think I've been asked out on a date.

04:32.563 --> 04:33.523
Nice.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.691
No, I work with him.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.734
-Hasn't stopped you before.
-I supervise him.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.153
-Schedules can be changed.
-He's polyamorous.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.573
Unless he also texted you
a ring, it's just a date.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.117
And you need to get out more.

04:45.660 --> 04:46.744
So do I.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.712
[Dr. Andrews] You want to take down
the splenocolic ligament.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.798
Just don't nick
the inferior mesenteric artery.

04:58.881 --> 05:02.635
[Asher] I feel the I.M.A. under my finger.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.429
Placing the stapler.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.347
And cutting.

05:07.473 --> 05:08.683
I voted "approve."

05:11.686 --> 05:12.895
Disapprove.

05:13.479 --> 05:14.689
No opinion.

05:15.064 --> 05:16.065
There's a poll?

05:16.149 --> 05:17.942
Yes… About shower sex.

05:18.609 --> 05:21.237
I know it's wrong
to discuss shower sex at work,

05:21.321 --> 05:22.739
so I did a poll instead.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.157
Much better.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.909
Dr. Murphy, do you really
want people knowing the details

05:26.993 --> 05:28.202
of your personal life?

05:28.286 --> 05:31.331
You don't think they took it
as an abstract question?

05:31.414 --> 05:34.375
No. We all take it as something
that happened between you and Lea.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.626
And that there was a fight.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.545
[Dr. Park] Sometime before
8:00 a.m. today,

05:37.628 --> 05:39.297
which was when the poll was sent out.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.550
You are very astute.

05:42.633 --> 05:45.845
I'm seeing diffuse dilation
of the large bowel here.

05:45.928 --> 05:46.763
Is that normal?

05:48.389 --> 05:50.725
Some calcified lesions.

05:51.642 --> 05:52.935
Wall's thin, too.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.145
Hirschsprung's.

05:54.228 --> 05:56.314
I thought Hirschsprung's
was a disease only babies

05:56.397 --> 05:58.524
-and young children got.
-It is.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.401
But he has it.

06:09.660 --> 06:13.081
We treated the Hirschsprung's by
removing the dilated part of your colon.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.083
It won't impact your life,

06:15.166 --> 06:16.667
but we would like an explanation.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.754
[Dr. Park] Dr. Murphy doesn't mean
we expect you to be a diagnostician.

06:19.837 --> 06:21.297
It's just…

06:21.380 --> 06:23.049
This was kind of singular.

06:23.132 --> 06:25.384
So, if you have any thoughts…

06:25.468 --> 06:28.221
Did anyone in your family
suddenly develop these symptoms?

06:31.974 --> 06:35.895
I did something singular to myself
about six months ago.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.564
I modified my genetic code.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.442
I did a CRISPR procedure
under the guidance of some researchers

06:41.526 --> 06:42.944
I know in China through my work.

06:43.027 --> 06:44.737
They put together a series of cocktails.

06:44.821 --> 06:49.117
They FedExed them to be,
and Sophie helped me inject them

06:49.200 --> 06:50.493
into my bone marrow.

06:50.576 --> 06:51.702
Why?

06:51.786 --> 06:53.204
If you know anything about CRISPR,

06:53.287 --> 06:55.623
you know how risky it is
to tinker with your genome.

06:55.706 --> 06:58.334
You have no idea what problems
you might let loose.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.503
I needed to optimize
my telomerase activity.

07:00.586 --> 07:03.548
It's the enzyme responsible for correcting
cell replication errors,

07:03.631 --> 07:05.967
-the cause of aging.
-[Shaun] You can't stop aging

07:06.050 --> 07:07.969
through changing your telomerase activity.

07:08.052 --> 07:11.597
You might extend your life a little,
but exercise…

07:11.681 --> 07:14.267
It does the same thing. Much less risky.

07:14.350 --> 07:15.893
Your decision makes no sense.

07:15.977 --> 07:19.355
Extending my life by a few years
is only my short-term goal.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.441
Look, you know how fast
medicine is moving.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.317
The day isn't that far away when cloning

07:23.401 --> 07:26.362
will make transplants as easy
as switching out a light socket.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.114
AI will start to make breakthroughs

07:28.197 --> 07:29.824
that we can't predict or understand.

07:29.907 --> 07:32.785
Medical knowledge will rise exponentially.

07:32.869 --> 07:35.371
There are babies born now
who could live to see it,

07:35.455 --> 07:37.623
could live to be 1,000 years old.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.083
Maybe more. Maybe forever.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.919
Or at least, as long as they want to.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.338
So, our plan is to give my CRISPR a year

07:44.422 --> 07:46.424
to make sure the telomerase change works,

07:46.507 --> 07:48.634
and then we'll do her.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.638
We'll aspirate a sample
of your bone marrow.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.932
See if we can figure out
what the hell you did.

07:56.726 --> 07:57.935
[elevator bell dings]

08:02.315 --> 08:03.149
Hey.

08:03.232 --> 08:06.944
Um… I don't think coffee's a good idea.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.864
Entire civilizations rely on it.
But I don't think

08:09.947 --> 08:11.616
you're referring to the beverage itself.

08:11.699 --> 08:14.994
I don't think it's a good idea for
first-years and fourth-years to go out.

08:15.077 --> 08:17.830
I am bound to supervise you
at some point in the future,

08:17.914 --> 08:20.958
and it'd get complicated
trying to change dates out,

08:21.042 --> 08:23.252
and the fact is…

08:23.961 --> 08:26.839
Seeing somebody you work with
rarely ends happily.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.925
So, I appreciate you
thinking of me, but I…

08:29.008 --> 08:30.635
Oh, you thought it was a date.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.930
I'm still new here,
and I thought it was

08:34.013 --> 08:36.432
a good opportunity to get
to know each other.

08:37.391 --> 08:39.560
Coffee's perfect because you're asking

08:39.644 --> 08:42.271
the least amount of commitment
from another human being.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.564
It's not even lunch.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.400
If it's still a "no," it's still a "no,"

08:46.484 --> 08:48.402
but I'll let you re-think your answer.

09:02.333 --> 09:05.169
He only claimed
it wasn't a date to save face.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.921
Or maybe I just assumed.

09:07.755 --> 09:08.965
But why did I assume?

09:09.048 --> 09:10.800
I don't think I'm some kind of narcissist

09:10.883 --> 09:13.386
who thinks every man
wants to get close to me.

09:14.053 --> 09:17.139
Or we both assumed it's a date
because it's a date.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.850
This is fun. I like being your bestie.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.018
Slumber party?

09:24.397 --> 09:25.606
[door opens]

09:27.108 --> 09:30.027
I made a poll to test
the popularity of shower sex.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.195
I heard.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.447
I fielded some questions about that.

09:33.531 --> 09:37.702
"Approve" has won,
but don't get too excited, Lea.

09:37.785 --> 09:40.121
It's only 58-38,

09:40.204 --> 09:42.623
with several complicated noncommittals,

09:42.707 --> 09:45.251
so clearly my attitude is reasonable.

09:45.334 --> 09:46.711
We don't have room for a…

09:47.712 --> 09:49.463
skier exercise thing.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.508
I'm only putting it together
so I can take a picture

09:52.592 --> 09:53.718
and sell it online.

09:53.801 --> 09:56.137
Why do you have it if you don't want it?

10:02.143 --> 10:04.645
My ex sent it.

10:05.896 --> 10:06.731
"Ex"?

10:07.648 --> 10:09.066
Husband.

10:11.193 --> 10:12.445
I left this thing in the attic

10:12.528 --> 10:14.655
until I got settled somewhere
with enough space.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.574
And okay, that was 10 years ago,

10:16.657 --> 10:18.492
but it's not like it was in his way.

10:21.996 --> 10:26.125
We got married, not for long,
right out of high school.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.918
Literally the boy next door.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.004
We grew up together. People expected it.

10:30.087 --> 10:33.424
It… was a big mistake.

10:33.507 --> 10:35.426
We both realized it pretty quickly.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.391
[Enrique] Why would you even
want to live forever?

10:42.475 --> 10:44.602
-You'd be bored out of your mind.
-[chuckles]

10:44.685 --> 10:46.771
The person I am now

10:46.854 --> 10:49.940
is miles away from the person I was at 14.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.652
I only get more distant every year.

10:54.236 --> 10:57.531
You learn to understand,

10:58.616 --> 11:01.160
love books that you once hated,

11:02.411 --> 11:05.247
sometimes people you once hated.

11:05.331 --> 11:09.293
Music that you didn't get
the point of becomes magical.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.046
And a thousand new doors will open.

11:12.129 --> 11:14.006
I look forward to the adventure.

11:14.632 --> 11:15.841
-[needle squelches]
-Ow.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.386
Sorry. Adventure's not always
gonna be fun.

11:20.054 --> 11:23.557
I figure it takes 40 or 50 years

11:23.641 --> 11:26.143
just to get over the things
your parents did.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.812
If only we lived long enough,

11:27.895 --> 11:31.732
the human race might finally
have a chance to grow up.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.282
What size shoes do you wear?

11:40.908 --> 11:42.201
Seven and a half.

11:43.327 --> 11:45.496
"Dr. Allen's Walking On Clouds Inserts."

11:45.579 --> 11:47.998
"Doctor" in the name
is always good marketing strategy.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.668
They're designed to reduce inflammation

11:50.751 --> 11:52.670
that could lead to plantar fasciitis,

11:52.753 --> 11:55.297
calluses, arthritis,
and they feel damn good.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.466
Does this have anything
to do with our patient's

11:57.550 --> 11:58.717
venture capitalist husband?

11:58.801 --> 12:00.177
I need testimonials.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.679
Labs and Path for Hannah Palmer.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.935
Aren't we all busy enough
learning how to be surgeons?

12:08.018 --> 12:10.855
Do you really want to divide your focus
onto something trivial?

12:15.651 --> 12:18.737
Because wanting to make money
taints the purity of medicine?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.283
I have five brothers.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.618
I've been taking care of people
my whole life.

12:24.702 --> 12:28.205
Someone got hurt,
they came to me to patch them up.

12:28.289 --> 12:31.500
I became a doctor
so I could get paid for it,

12:31.584 --> 12:34.462
but also because I'm good
at taking care of people.

12:34.545 --> 12:37.173
It's possible to do something
for more than one reason.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.977
The news is bad.

12:59.153 --> 13:02.490
There's an abnormally healthy population

13:02.573 --> 13:05.242
of hematopoietic progenitor stem cells.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.536
-He did it?
-It's significant.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.873
He's succeeded in optimizing
enough telomerase activity

13:10.956 --> 13:13.417
to potentially add 10 years
to his natural life.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.961
[Dr. Andrews] Well, assuming
it doesn't subtract about 50.

13:16.045 --> 13:19.089
There's already an autoimmune reaction
that mimics Hirschsprung's.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.257
Who knows what else he did?

13:20.341 --> 13:22.801
What if this is the opposite
of an auto-immune condition?

13:22.885 --> 13:25.888
What if he's done something
that lowers his resistance to infection?

13:25.971 --> 13:28.224
Then we'd be seeing
more opportunistic infections

13:28.307 --> 13:29.642
of the lungs and skin.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.477
If you lived another 1,000 years,

13:31.560 --> 13:34.980
would you be with the same person
at the end as at the beginning?

13:35.064 --> 13:36.106
-No.
-No.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.859
No, if you assume monogamy.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.778
That puts too much strain
on a relationship.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.072
Is one person supposed to
be everything to another,

13:43.155 --> 13:44.740
all the time, for 1,000 years?

13:44.823 --> 13:48.452
Apparently Jesus agrees.
On monogamy.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.996
He said that, in Heaven,
there'll be no more marriages.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.291
I guess humans can't sustain
a relationship that long.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.834
You read the New Testament, too?

13:55.918 --> 13:58.254
And the Qur'an. And other things.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.672
It's like you're a stalker.

13:59.755 --> 14:02.258
It's like you and God
had an acrimonious divorce.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.678
What if he caused neurofibromatosis?

14:05.761 --> 14:07.763
Microscopic tumors forming
on the nerve sheath?

14:07.846 --> 14:11.183
Mm. Possible, but there'd have been
some evidence of Schwann cell growth

14:11.267 --> 14:12.226
around his colon.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.853
Would you still love your wife
in 1,000 years?

14:16.772 --> 14:19.024
You have three answers.
That should be enough.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.318
Park's marriage failed in far less time,

14:21.402 --> 14:22.820
and Enrique doesn't even try.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.321
Asher is an…

14:24.655 --> 14:25.781
unknown quantity.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.157
You're committed.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.076
You've made promises.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.497
I've made promises based on

14:33.581 --> 14:36.125
an understood human life-span, Murphy.

14:37.293 --> 14:40.337
Most likely diagnosis is
autoimmune polyneuropathy.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.089
It damaged the enteral ganglion nerve

14:42.172 --> 14:43.591
and led to the perforations.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.676
Start him on steroids
and immunosuppressants.

14:46.343 --> 14:47.595
Dr. Andrews.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.597
So, you wouldn't have gotten married

14:49.680 --> 14:51.348
if you thought it would be forever.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.184
You expect all relationships
to fail over time.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.978
It's just a question of how long?

14:57.813 --> 14:59.315
I love her now.

15:00.065 --> 15:03.485
I intend to love her as long as I live.

15:04.570 --> 15:08.991
But, eventually, everything breaks.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.336
I always go back to comfort reading
when I'm in the hospital.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.296
Cozy mysteries in little English villages,

15:22.379 --> 15:24.798
where nothing bad happens
to anyone we like.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.177
We've gotten your results back.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.638
-When will your husband be…
-Is it cancer?

15:33.057 --> 15:33.891
Yes.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.062
Thyroid carcinoma.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.856
We're gonna do
a complete imaging series

15:40.940 --> 15:42.191
to pinpoint just how advanced…

15:42.274 --> 15:43.108
Treatment?

15:44.318 --> 15:47.321
Surgery to remove some
or all of your thyroid

15:47.404 --> 15:49.907
is usually the first line of defense.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.660
Sometimes, we can wait,
but given the hematoma

15:52.743 --> 15:56.413
was probably caused
by the tumor invading nearby vasculatures,

15:56.497 --> 15:59.041
-we should do it in the next few days.
-[wheezes]

15:59.124 --> 16:01.752
Later, there'll be radioactive
iodine treatment…

16:02.544 --> 16:04.171
[wheezes]

16:04.254 --> 16:05.339
Panic attack?

16:05.422 --> 16:07.841
[wheezing]

16:11.053 --> 16:12.554
Her trachea's deviated to the right.

16:12.638 --> 16:15.057
The tumor's compressing it.
We're doing surgery now.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.059
[groaning]

16:20.270 --> 16:22.106
[monitor beeping]

16:27.528 --> 16:29.405
What happened?
The nurse just said "surgery."

16:29.488 --> 16:30.698
Was it the hematoma?

16:31.907 --> 16:33.075
It's more serious.

16:34.868 --> 16:36.870
I… It's not cancer…

16:37.496 --> 16:38.497
again.

16:39.289 --> 16:40.874
Thyroid carcinoma.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.920
We've removed her thyroid.
She's doing well.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.839
We're looking into potential causes…

16:46.922 --> 16:48.674
Genetic, environmental.

16:48.757 --> 16:52.594
There may be a deeper issue
that we can find and address.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.231
I can't do this.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.277
You've done it before.

17:09.570 --> 17:10.988
You'll do it this time.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.287
Do you know what it's like…

17:19.580 --> 17:23.000
to wake up every morning and know
your wife might not be here next year?

17:24.626 --> 17:26.879
All those treatments…

17:27.838 --> 17:31.341
they all… They all have this
little tag attached to them

17:31.425 --> 17:34.511
that says, "Because she might die."

17:35.095 --> 17:38.265
And you see them put those gloves on

17:38.348 --> 17:39.600
before they hook up the chemo.

17:39.683 --> 17:41.101
You know why they do that.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.396
It's because it's poison.

17:46.607 --> 17:47.858
And you sit there…

17:49.568 --> 17:52.446
And you watch them
shove poison into the person you love.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.448
And why?

17:56.366 --> 17:58.327
Because she might die.

18:00.996 --> 18:03.415
We're killing her because she might die.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.379
Go for a run.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.673
Go punch a wall.

18:12.341 --> 18:13.926
You need to release some endorphins.

18:14.009 --> 18:15.511
My release is my job.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.429
That's why I love it.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.516
My work requires total focus.

18:20.599 --> 18:21.850
And every minute I'm working

18:21.934 --> 18:23.852
is a minute I'm not thinking about…

18:24.770 --> 18:25.979
losing her.

18:31.568 --> 18:32.569
I have to go.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.995
Your pain and weakness
are consistent with polyneuropathy,

18:42.079 --> 18:44.706
treatable with steroids
and immunosuppressants.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.751
If you live 1,000 years,
will you still love Sophie?

18:50.337 --> 18:51.421
Yes.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.298
How can you be sure?

18:53.382 --> 18:55.717
People change. You expect to change.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.637
Sophie and I will change together.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.598
We'll go through the same adventures
and learn the same lessons.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.976
What if you go through
the same adventures

19:04.059 --> 19:05.811
and learn different lessons?

19:05.894 --> 19:08.772
Even if we did, whoever,
whatever we become,

19:08.856 --> 19:10.399
Sophie will always be beautiful.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.318
I mean, she could turn into
a machine or a set of pixels

19:13.402 --> 19:16.238
or a giant purple flower,
and she'll still be beautiful,

19:16.321 --> 19:19.158
because it's part of
her essential nature.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.872
But if you don't know
how you'll change,

19:24.955 --> 19:26.790
you don't know how you'll change.

19:26.874 --> 19:27.875
Shaun.

19:29.334 --> 19:30.544
We'll let you get some rest.

19:30.627 --> 19:32.713
The steroids should make you
feel a lot better.

19:39.386 --> 19:43.599
Why didn't you ever mention
you had an ex-husband?

19:44.224 --> 19:47.686
Shaun, I've barely
thought about him in years.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.607
I didn't mention him
because he's not important.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.401
I know. That's the problem.

19:55.152 --> 19:58.155
At one time, you felt he was
important enough to your life

19:58.238 --> 20:01.408
to marry him, and now
you barely think of him.

20:01.992 --> 20:05.370
You make long-term plans,
you have expectations,

20:05.454 --> 20:07.414
and then something happens to you,

20:07.497 --> 20:09.833
and suddenly you're a different person.

20:11.835 --> 20:15.547
I know you don't like change,
but it's not all bad.

20:16.798 --> 20:20.510
After all, you are working
to change yourself all the time.

20:21.345 --> 20:27.184
I'm working to be a better surgeon,
a better boyfriend,

20:27.267 --> 20:30.646
better at the things I've chosen,
but this…

20:31.480 --> 20:32.940
other change… It's unpredictable.

20:33.023 --> 20:34.107
You don't choose it.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.068
It just comes at you.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.862
Oh, it's like hurricanes before 1873,

20:38.946 --> 20:41.073
when the Army Signal Corps
first put up flags

20:41.156 --> 20:42.824
to warn people storms were coming.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.410
Before that, houses were flattened,
lives destroyed,

20:45.494 --> 20:47.913
and there was no way to see
it was heading for you.

20:47.996 --> 20:49.206
Shaun.

20:49.998 --> 20:53.126
Our relationship will not end
in natural disaster.

20:53.877 --> 20:55.087
It did begin in one.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.425
I'm going to look in on my patient.

21:01.510 --> 21:02.594
Okay.

21:09.518 --> 21:13.063
Blood and saliva will tell us
if there's a genetic cause,

21:13.146 --> 21:14.856
and the samples
we take from your house

21:14.940 --> 21:17.067
will tell us if there's
something environmental.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.363
I know it's… stupid.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.950
I've almost felt guilty for my cancer,

21:25.033 --> 21:29.371
like I arbitrarily decided
to be sick and burdensome.

21:31.873 --> 21:33.417
Do the people you're close to

21:33.500 --> 21:35.669
ever act like you're a burden to them?

21:36.128 --> 21:37.212
You mean Alan.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.008
He's scared.

21:41.717 --> 21:45.429
He takes the exit he's got
and he turns to his work.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.347
You're okay with that?

21:55.355 --> 21:57.566
I accept this compromise.

21:57.649 --> 22:00.068
That's not the hard part.
The hard part is…

22:00.902 --> 22:02.321
not knowing.

22:04.031 --> 22:07.117
Each new thing that happens,
I worry, "Is this it?

22:08.785 --> 22:10.287
Is this where I lose him?

22:11.913 --> 22:13.415
Is this where he breaks?"

22:21.048 --> 22:22.883
[Claire] So, this is boiled coffee.

22:23.258 --> 22:25.135
Some people call it "Turkish coffee,"

22:25.218 --> 22:27.679
or "Greek coffee," or "Egyptian coffee"…

22:28.138 --> 22:30.932
Because we need to take ownership
and put things in categories.

22:31.016 --> 22:31.933
Yeah.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.394
You actually live in this thing,

22:34.478 --> 22:36.563
in the hospital parking garage?

22:36.646 --> 22:37.647
Why not?

22:37.731 --> 22:38.982
Convenient for work.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.568
When I want to spend
a few days off the beaten track,

22:41.651 --> 22:43.070
it's convenient for that, too.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.281
Ooh. I'm gonna get three sips in this.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.617
But three really great sips.

22:50.368 --> 22:51.995
That's how I try to live my life…

22:52.329 --> 22:56.249
Try to appreciate, savor, not pass by.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.379
Is that what the polyamory is about?

23:02.714 --> 23:05.717
Does it really work,
or is it one of those theories about life

23:05.801 --> 23:07.302
that people regret later?

23:07.385 --> 23:08.637
No regrets so far.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.305
Mm-hmm. No, I guess not.

23:10.388 --> 23:12.766
Not while you're young and having fun.

23:13.600 --> 23:14.810
It is fun,

23:14.893 --> 23:16.770
but not for the reasons
that you're thinking.

23:16.853 --> 23:18.063
It isn't about sex.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.858
It's about commitment,
emotional connection.

23:21.942 --> 23:24.152
The joy I'm sure you get
out of a relationship,

23:24.236 --> 23:25.195
I get a little more.

23:25.278 --> 23:27.405
Also, I have to give a little more.

23:27.489 --> 23:28.907
But that's meaningful, too.

23:30.367 --> 23:31.284
Hmm.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.079
Do you mind if I ask you something,

23:34.162 --> 23:35.789
since we're getting personal?

23:40.085 --> 23:41.169
Sure.

23:41.795 --> 23:43.839
What's your favorite misheard song lyric?

23:45.590 --> 23:46.508
[laughs]

23:52.430 --> 23:53.515
This is nice.

23:55.809 --> 23:57.644
I'm glad it's not a date.

23:58.395 --> 23:59.479
Me, too.

24:00.021 --> 24:01.648
I don't believe in those categories.

24:06.027 --> 24:08.780
-[machine beeping]
-He reported widespread bilateral pain,

24:08.864 --> 24:10.991
then he keeled over.
BP dropped to 80 over palp.

24:11.074 --> 24:12.242
I'll order a vasopressor.

24:12.325 --> 24:13.535
-Already did.
-Good.

24:13.618 --> 24:17.289
We need an EKG, CBC, and chest images,
and a new diagnosis.

24:17.706 --> 24:20.458
Whatever he caused with CRISPR,
it's not just neuropathy.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.169
Something else is killing him.

24:30.135 --> 24:33.930
What if he's caused something that mimics
carcinomatous autonomic neuropathy?

24:34.014 --> 24:36.266
It explains the BP and bowel issue.

24:36.349 --> 24:39.269
That doesn't explain the sensory issue
that led to the frostbite.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.149
A connective tissue disorder?

24:44.232 --> 24:47.068
That would have shown up on the scans.
His chest looks normal.

24:51.948 --> 24:54.701
Maybe we can't think of the answer
because there is no answer.

24:54.784 --> 24:56.870
We keep trying to jam it
into categories we know,

24:56.953 --> 24:58.288
the diseases that we know.

24:58.371 --> 25:00.790
But this never existed before.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.751
He created a new combination
of genetic code.

25:02.834 --> 25:04.669
That means a new combination of symptoms.

25:04.753 --> 25:07.923
We shouldn't be looking at what fits
the picture, but at what's closest

25:08.006 --> 25:10.550
to the picture, so we can at least
figure out a treatment.

25:10.634 --> 25:14.304
And what it's closest to is amyloidosis.

25:14.387 --> 25:16.973
This isn't an autoimmune neuropathy,

25:17.057 --> 25:19.392
so the nerves must be under attack
by something else.

25:19.476 --> 25:21.686
Something like amyloid disease
could leave deposits

25:21.770 --> 25:24.022
along the nerves,
causing the symptoms we've seen.

25:24.105 --> 25:25.941
Where do we look for those deposits?

25:26.775 --> 25:27.984
The spleen.

25:34.532 --> 25:35.617
Drink all 8 ounces.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.079
We talked. We had a few laughs.

25:39.162 --> 25:41.039
Well, sounds date-y to me.

25:41.122 --> 25:43.375
[groans] I don't think Enrique's a player.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.335
No, he's kind of the opposite of a player.

25:45.418 --> 25:47.671
With him,
emotional connection is the point.

25:47.754 --> 25:49.714
He's trying to live
some idealistic fantasy

25:49.798 --> 25:51.758
where everyone is nice
and no one is jealous.

25:51.841 --> 25:53.260
I am so staying away.

25:53.343 --> 25:54.386
Well, of course.

25:54.469 --> 25:57.389
Once I heard "emotional connection,"
I knew the game was over.

25:57.472 --> 25:58.890
What does that mean?

25:58.974 --> 26:00.392
I'm against emotion?

26:00.475 --> 26:02.852
[chuckles] I'm not the one
with "cold-hearted bitch"

26:02.936 --> 26:04.354
as my social media hashtag.

26:04.437 --> 26:05.605
She's an excellent doctor.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.190
Every time you've loved somebody,

26:07.274 --> 26:09.234
it's ended in disappointment or death…

26:09.317 --> 26:10.277
Sometimes both.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.444
It's like a reflex now.

26:11.528 --> 26:14.698
You just expect that
everything ends badly, so why start?

26:14.781 --> 26:18.118
So, despite the many
practical reasons not to go out

26:18.201 --> 26:20.245
with a first-year, this is all about me?

26:20.328 --> 26:21.955
Is that a diamond ring?

26:23.748 --> 26:24.791
I mean, it's pretty.

26:24.874 --> 26:26.584
Our patient caught her fiancé cheating.

26:26.668 --> 26:28.753
Big fight. He demanded the ring back.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.171
She swallowed it.

26:30.255 --> 26:31.131
I did.

26:31.214 --> 26:34.092
You don't even know if this is
"going out," and that's the point.

26:34.175 --> 26:36.177
It doesn't matter what Enrique's offering.

26:36.261 --> 26:39.723
Whether it's friendship or romance,
you're not investing. You're risk-averse.

26:39.806 --> 26:42.475
Your portfolio now
is entirely in T-Bills and money market.

26:42.559 --> 26:43.560
No idea what that means.

26:43.643 --> 26:45.854
It's too bad,
because a guy that can make you laugh

26:45.937 --> 26:48.189
might be just what you need right now.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.150
It's progressed to your large intestine.

26:50.233 --> 26:52.402
Here's a plastic bag.
Put it over the toilet seat.

26:52.485 --> 26:55.030
You'll have every opportunity
to recover your property.

26:58.658 --> 27:01.202
Don't run away from a chance at love.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.164
It's a date…

27:05.665 --> 27:07.167
Maybe. I don't know.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.335
Oh.

27:10.170 --> 27:12.005
[Olivia] Her house is full of T.C.E.,

27:12.088 --> 27:13.298
a side effect from chip-making

27:13.381 --> 27:15.175
back in Silicon Valley's early days.

27:15.258 --> 27:17.010
So, they move away
from their toxic home,

27:17.093 --> 27:19.846
-and hopefully things get a little better.
-Probably not much.

27:19.929 --> 27:21.848
She also has a genetic predisposition.

27:21.931 --> 27:23.141
It's both?

27:23.725 --> 27:25.727
She shouldn't go outside in a rainstorm.

27:26.853 --> 27:28.813
How do you tell a woman
that her third cancer

27:28.897 --> 27:30.774
likely won't be close to her last?

27:33.735 --> 27:36.571
Unfortunately, this is a teaching moment.

27:39.115 --> 27:41.659
Dr. Allen, after 12 hours on duty,

27:41.743 --> 27:44.412
I can report that
your inserts came through.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.748
Check your e-mail.
You'll find my testimonial.

27:46.831 --> 27:47.832
[exhales sharply]

27:47.916 --> 27:49.000
Claire. Olivia.

27:55.131 --> 27:56.633
[exhales sharply]

27:56.716 --> 27:58.927
And if you're right, what will you do?

27:59.677 --> 28:02.097
We'll treat the symptoms
with targeted drug therapies.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.933
There really isn't a disease, as such,
that we can address.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.101
Ow.

28:12.357 --> 28:13.441
The pain shifted?

28:13.525 --> 28:15.068
Yeah. Oh.

28:15.610 --> 28:17.028
Never mind about the ultrasound.

28:17.112 --> 28:19.739
It's easier to check for deposits
after the organ's removed.

28:19.823 --> 28:20.657
-After it's…
-Yeah.

28:20.740 --> 28:23.159
His spleen's about to rupture.
Call a transport team.

28:25.036 --> 28:26.996
[alarm beeping]

28:27.080 --> 28:28.289
[groans]

28:35.380 --> 28:38.425
It's called Li-Fraumeni Syndrome… LFS.

28:38.758 --> 28:40.176
An inherited predisposition

28:40.260 --> 28:42.804
to developing a wide range of cancers.

28:42.887 --> 28:44.764
Yes, there was a toxin
in your environment

28:44.848 --> 28:46.224
that likely played a role in this,

28:46.307 --> 28:48.768
but there will be other triggers
in the future.

28:49.769 --> 28:51.229
Your body is super sensitive

28:51.312 --> 28:53.732
and will respond with tumors
for the rest of your life.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.825
I know that's a shock,

29:03.908 --> 29:05.744
but here's what you should know…

29:06.578 --> 29:09.998
Most cancers are treatable
if found early enough.

29:13.460 --> 29:16.337
We know the most common
associated with LFS,

29:16.421 --> 29:18.631
and we can do surveillance,

29:18.715 --> 29:21.551
nip anything in the bud
before it becomes a problem.

29:23.636 --> 29:27.140
It may not seem this way now,
but this is good.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.684
We know what we're dealing with.

29:29.768 --> 29:32.604
We're warned, and we'll be ready.

29:40.695 --> 29:42.614
He won't be able to handle this.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.371
[Dr. Andrews] Liver, pancreas,
other organs look normal.

29:50.455 --> 29:51.331
Ah.

29:51.998 --> 29:54.793
But there are calcified lesions
along these nerves.

29:54.876 --> 29:57.420
He's gonna be in pain like this
for the rest of his life.

29:57.504 --> 30:01.758
No. There's a reasonable chance
it'll get worse as time goes on.

30:01.841 --> 30:03.843
I need my sharp-blunt curved scissors.

30:03.927 --> 30:06.471
[Enrique] What if we used CRISPR
to reverse CRISPR?

30:07.680 --> 30:10.517
Researchers have identified
a protein in certain bacteria

30:10.600 --> 30:12.018
that inhibits CRISPR.

30:12.727 --> 30:14.896
What if we insert the DNA
that makes that protein

30:14.979 --> 30:16.231
into our patient's genome?

30:16.314 --> 30:17.899
That would deactivate the CRISPR gene.

30:17.982 --> 30:21.361
CRISPR messed him up permanently,
and you think we should do more of it?

30:21.444 --> 30:23.196
I don't know. Our patient is a risk-taker.

30:23.279 --> 30:24.781
We'd need a delivery mechanism.

30:24.864 --> 30:27.242
The code would have to be
introduced through a virus…

30:27.325 --> 30:29.911
A virus that specifically targets nerves.

30:31.996 --> 30:33.414
Polio targets nerves.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.667
[Asher] Because this isn't risky enough.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.460
[Enrique]
Polio is such a dangerous virus

30:37.544 --> 30:40.171
because it's so good
at penetrating the nervous system.

30:57.313 --> 30:58.523
Dr. Murphy?

31:02.902 --> 31:07.323
She's going to be this way… forever.

31:07.907 --> 31:10.368
She'll have good periods
and bad periods.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.371
But she will always
have to be on her guard.

31:14.706 --> 31:17.584
Is she always gonna have to be
on guard against you, too?

31:18.960 --> 31:19.961
What does that mean?

31:20.044 --> 31:22.547
Chronic illness puts strain
on relationships.

31:22.630 --> 31:26.134
Statistically, it is more often
the man who can't handle it.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.469
Our marriage is none of your business.

31:28.553 --> 31:29.971
Her health is my business.

31:30.054 --> 31:31.890
And your behavior adds to her stress.

31:34.517 --> 31:38.855
You look at her, and you imagine
she's gone, and that is hard.

31:38.938 --> 31:40.023
I get it.

31:42.066 --> 31:44.903
She thinks the same thing
when she looks at you.

31:45.778 --> 31:48.364
I never complain to her.
I know it's nobody's fault.

31:48.448 --> 31:51.326
You don't think she knows
you have trouble with all this?

31:51.409 --> 31:53.912
Every time something new happens,

31:53.995 --> 31:56.789
she wonders, is this the straw

31:56.873 --> 31:58.708
that is gonna break your marriage?

31:59.918 --> 32:02.670
You've got her living
in a constant state of uncertainty.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.298
That is practically
the definition of stress.

32:07.216 --> 32:10.303
So, this is the "straighten up
and fly right" lecture.

32:10.845 --> 32:11.846
No.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.266
I am…

32:16.684 --> 32:21.314
I'm telling you to consider
how best to time your divorce.

32:22.899 --> 32:25.526
There are gonna be
a lot of new issues dropping on Hannah,

32:25.610 --> 32:27.487
and if you're gonna end up
leaving anyway,

32:27.570 --> 32:28.821
you should start planning now.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.365
I don't want to leave my wife.

32:30.448 --> 32:31.658
My best advice?

32:32.909 --> 32:36.329
Help her through this next round
of treatment as best you can,

32:37.080 --> 32:38.081
and then get out.

32:39.874 --> 32:43.252
It's hard living with someone
who needs so much.

32:43.336 --> 32:47.340
I know you feel there is a point
where you have nothing left,

32:47.423 --> 32:48.925
where you're ready to break.

32:50.802 --> 32:55.223
Just… don't break when she needs you most.

32:57.058 --> 32:58.977
Get out before that happens.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.084
Reading an article that's five years old?

33:23.167 --> 33:26.129
Dr. Glassman was once involved
in an experimental attempt

33:26.212 --> 33:28.923
to treat Parkinson's
with CRISPR technology.

33:29.007 --> 33:29.841
It failed.

33:29.924 --> 33:31.759
So, it's both old and it didn't work?

33:31.843 --> 33:34.512
Dr. Glassman likes his failures
to be informative.

33:34.595 --> 33:36.597
That's why his articles are longer.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.725
Do you worry about losing
the people you love?

33:44.856 --> 33:47.567
Because we can't stop ourselves
from changing,

33:47.650 --> 33:49.861
which means we might
stop loving someone,

33:49.944 --> 33:51.487
or they might stop loving us.

33:51.571 --> 33:53.322
It is a very bad thing.

33:54.365 --> 33:55.450
It is.

33:58.286 --> 34:02.957
So, no one can ever feel… safe.

34:03.041 --> 34:06.878
How can you keep going
if you never feel safe?

34:11.340 --> 34:14.093
Well, sometimes,
not changing is just as dangerous.

34:16.929 --> 34:20.767
So, how do you know when to do what?

34:21.225 --> 34:22.435
[chuckles]

34:23.019 --> 34:25.146
If you find the answer to that,
let me know.

34:31.694 --> 34:33.529
-I have it.
-You do?

34:33.613 --> 34:36.324
Dr. Glassman used varicella zoster virus

34:36.407 --> 34:39.160
as the delivery mechanism,
which didn't work.

34:39.243 --> 34:41.329
His first choice was herpes simplex,

34:41.412 --> 34:44.874
but the technology was not up
to putting their DNA package into it.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.210
The technology has improved.

34:47.293 --> 34:48.503
It can be done.

34:53.591 --> 34:54.884
[grunts weakly]

34:54.967 --> 34:56.511
Using conventional treatments,

34:56.594 --> 34:58.221
there's nothing more we can do for you.

34:58.304 --> 35:01.140
The pain will be permanent,
and it could get worse.

35:02.850 --> 35:06.062
Well, I've not been one to be
limited by the conventional.

35:07.396 --> 35:09.357
We think we can reverse the CRISPR.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.401
You want to reverse what I did?
My telomerase change?

35:12.485 --> 35:13.861
They want to stop your pain.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.696
Soph, it's temporary.

35:15.780 --> 35:17.073
What is it, 40 years?

35:17.156 --> 35:20.409
That's nothing.
Our real lives are ahead of us.

35:20.493 --> 35:22.620
Hey, look, as long as
this doesn't kill me,
