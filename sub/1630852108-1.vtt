00:06.297 --> 00:07.549
[Frank] Dad?

00:09.384 --> 00:10.301
Dad!

00:11.136 --> 00:14.514
-Dad! I got one on the line!
-I'll help you, son.

00:14.597 --> 00:16.808
-[Frank grunting]
-Ooh. Ooh.

00:19.686 --> 00:22.272
Jeez, Dad, you're still strong as a bull.

00:22.355 --> 00:25.900
Oh, it takes more than a coronary
to stop me.

00:25.984 --> 00:31.573
Those doctors can shove
that pacemaker right up their ass.

00:31.656 --> 00:32.991
Is that how they put it in you?

00:33.074 --> 00:34.617
[both laugh]

00:34.701 --> 00:39.205
-I'm surprised you didn't ask for two!
-[coughs and laughs]

00:41.041 --> 00:42.292
Ah.

00:42.375 --> 00:46.296
I am so glad we have this time now
to patch things up between us.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.465
I really thought
I was gonna lose you before

00:48.548 --> 00:50.675
we had a chance to get to know each other.

00:53.887 --> 00:57.265
Are you crying, Francine?

00:57.932 --> 01:01.478
-No, I'm just--
-I'll give you something to cry about.

01:01.561 --> 01:04.856
-What?
-I'm gonna die on you now.

01:04.939 --> 01:07.442
[alarm blaring]

01:07.525 --> 01:08.777
No!

01:08.860 --> 01:10.737
Oh, for corn sakes, we're losing him.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.114
-Come on, do something!
-I am, Mr. Murphy.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.158
Ah, the fuck you are!
When Colt Luger died,

01:15.241 --> 01:18.912
they shoved a still-beating monkey heart
down his throat, and he was fine!

01:18.995 --> 01:19.913
[doctor] Clear!

01:19.996 --> 01:21.039
[gasps]

01:21.122 --> 01:23.666
-Frank...
-Dad, what is it? What do you want to say?

01:23.750 --> 01:26.795
Hey, hey, Frank, look at this!
I created a life!

01:26.878 --> 01:28.797
Not now, Vic.
Dad, what are you trying to say?

01:28.880 --> 01:29.964
[gasping] I...

01:30.048 --> 01:32.008
And this little dude is all Vic, man.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.428
He'll need extra-large diapers,
if you get my drift.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.473
[chuckles] You'll be seeing him
in Times Square, man.

01:38.556 --> 01:40.767
I'm saying
he's got a big ol' honking ass--

01:40.850 --> 01:42.560
Will you shut the fuck up?

01:43.186 --> 01:45.230
-Frank... [gasps] Frank...
-[monitor beeping]

01:45.313 --> 01:47.607
What is it, Dad?
What are you trying to tell me?

01:48.358 --> 01:51.319
Box 16.

01:53.238 --> 01:56.116
Box 16. What the fuck does that mean?

01:56.199 --> 01:57.200
[monitor flatlining]

01:57.283 --> 01:58.493
[nurse] We lost him.

01:58.576 --> 02:01.371
Oh, no, you can't die
and leave me with that!

02:01.454 --> 02:03.665
-Get up! Get up, you son of a bitch!
-[nurse] Oh!

02:03.748 --> 02:06.042
-Dad, no! Stop hurting Grandpa!
-[Frank grunting]

02:06.126 --> 02:07.877
Shut up! [grunts]

02:07.961 --> 02:09.254
I'm helping him!

02:09.337 --> 02:11.047
[Bill] Holy shit, Dad's crying.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.800
[Frank] I am not crying! You are! [grunts]

02:13.883 --> 02:15.969
Your father's not always like this.

02:16.052 --> 02:18.638
[Frank] I will put you
through that fucking divider curtain!

He must've posed for this
between beatings.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.528
Frank, we better leave
for the funeral home.

03:15.612 --> 03:18.406
-The viewing starts in half an hour.
-Beautiful! Let's do it!

03:18.489 --> 03:21.451
Frank, you don't have to be strong.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.578
You'll be going through
a lot of different feelings

03:23.661 --> 03:25.538
over these next few days.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.624
The grieving process is complicated.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.543
Well, is relief part of the process?

[chuckling] 'Cause I feel
like I just finished my taxes.

03:33.087 --> 03:35.924
Frank, you must be feeling
some kind of sadness.

03:36.007 --> 03:40.220
Nah, it's like eating a bologna sandwich
on white bread with no mustard.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.722
I know I'm chewing something,
but there's no taste.

03:42.805 --> 03:45.099
And when I belch later,
it won't remind me of anything.

03:45.683 --> 03:46.601
If you say so.

03:46.684 --> 03:50.146
I do say so. Did the people
of Whoville cry when the Grinch died?

03:50.230 --> 03:51.648
The Grinch didn't die.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.234
Everyone loved him
after he opened his heart.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.694
-I don't remember that.
-That's because you turned off the TV

03:56.778 --> 04:00.281
in the middle, saying, "This green
cocksucker reminds me of my dad."

04:00.365 --> 04:02.158
Oh, I was having fun.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.454
All right, let's put
that miserable bastard in the ground.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.580
But now you're a co-princess.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.749

04:51.833 --> 04:53.334
That's a very important job.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.586
You're Marty Allen. Never forget that.

04:55.670 --> 04:59.007
Are we still having my birthday party
at the bowling alley on Sunday?

04:59.090 --> 05:01.718
What? When did I say we were doing that?

05:01.801 --> 05:05.388
Tuesday, after you came back
from talking to the funeral home man.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.515
Aw, jeez, I've been a little out of it.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.350
You were really sad on Tuesday.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.520
I was not. Christ, can't a man
just stare at his shoes?

05:12.603 --> 05:16.232
[sighs] It's almost a quarter of. She said
she'd come over to watch the baby.

I've been sitting here for an hour!

05:19.902 --> 05:23.239

05:24.407 --> 05:30.621
Oh, I'll-a take-a good care of
this beautiful little piece of prosciutt

05:30.705 --> 05:34.208
with some-a help
from my little assistant, Anthony.

05:34.292 --> 05:37.545
I want a Lite-Brite
and a Buster Thunder Junior doll

05:37.628 --> 05:40.631
and some nasty-ass pussy!

05:40.715 --> 05:41.966
Thank you, Santy Claus.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.385
Jerry Lewis shows us
his firearm collection,

05:48.181 --> 05:52.852
with special guest stars the LA Lakers
and former First Lady Pat Nixon!

05:52.935 --> 05:56.647
Ah, and the worst part of all of this
is I got to miss Colt.

05:56.731 --> 05:57.940
All right, here we go.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.194
The sooner we get to the funeral parlor,
the quicker it'll be over.

06:01.277 --> 06:02.278
[all] Trick or treat!

I can't believe I have to miss out
on Halloween again. It stinks.

06:15.875 --> 06:19.170
Yeah. I wish I was chucking eggs
at our house.

06:24.092 --> 06:29.263
-[Otto] Oh, ja, it is a very sad day.
-Yeah, he was such a... such a nice man.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.519
He looks so old.

06:34.602 --> 06:37.939
-He looks like Dad with lipstick.
-[scoffs] Except he's smiling.

06:38.022 --> 06:40.900
Maybe when you die,
you'll smile too, Daddy.

06:40.983 --> 06:43.403
-Ear to ear, honey.
-Nobody else is dying!

06:43.486 --> 06:47.073
Mr. Murphy, your father
would be proud to know that you chose

06:47.156 --> 06:50.201
the Mahogany Fortress X-Five-Hundred,

06:50.284 --> 06:51.953
the sturdiest coffin on the market.

06:52.036 --> 06:54.664
Jesus Christ himself
couldn't walk out of this baby.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.917
If He was buried in it, we'd all be Jews!
[chuckles]

06:58.000 --> 06:59.794
Worth every penny.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.963
A whole shitload of pennies.

07:02.046 --> 07:03.714
Yes, well,

07:03.798 --> 07:05.925
there's no perfect time to do this,

07:06.008 --> 07:08.678
but... here's your invoice.

07:08.761 --> 07:12.640
Oh, sweet Jesus. Christ, why didn't we
just have him fucking bronzed?

07:12.723 --> 07:14.725
That is still an option.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.686
Mommy, where's Grandpa Bill now?

07:16.769 --> 07:18.396
He's right in front of you, idiot.

07:18.479 --> 07:19.439
-[grunts]
-[groans]

07:19.522 --> 07:21.023
Mom, tell her to cut it out!

07:21.107 --> 07:22.650
Both of you, stop it!

07:22.733 --> 07:24.902
Grandpa's in heaven, honey.

07:24.986 --> 07:28.489
Actually, because he didn't receive
the sacrament of last rites

07:28.573 --> 07:29.615
before he died,

07:29.699 --> 07:33.411
your grandfather's soul
is trapped in purgatory,

07:33.494 --> 07:36.831
where every second
is like a hundred years of our time.

07:36.914 --> 07:39.625
He's in purgatory? That's awful!

07:39.709 --> 07:42.128
Yes, but he can get out with prayer.

07:42.211 --> 07:43.588
That's better than limbo,

07:43.671 --> 07:50.344
where unbaptized dead babies languish
just out of God's grace for all eternity.

07:51.220 --> 07:54.182
-Sue, this guy is fucking me.
-Mom, is Grandpa trapped forever?

07:54.265 --> 07:56.976
Mom, can I take my tie off?
It's turning my neck green.

07:57.059 --> 08:00.021
Disposal fee?
I mean, that's what this whole thing is!

08:00.104 --> 08:02.440
Ah, Christ, does the town pool charge you
for getting wet?

08:02.523 --> 08:05.151
Mom, can we eat the food here,
or is it going in Grandpa's grave?

08:05.234 --> 08:09.572
Guys, please! I am trying to pray.
I could use a quiet moment.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.950
[Ginny] Oh, Murphys? Sad Murphys?

08:13.034 --> 08:14.410
[all] Oh, fuck me.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.455
Oh, Sue! Come to my arms!

08:17.538 --> 08:19.624
Ginny, I have to step outside.
I'm feeling sick.

08:19.707 --> 08:23.503
Aw, that's what Greg used to say
when I'd get out of the shower.

08:23.586 --> 08:27.381
-Oh, hi, Sue. What are you--
-Janet, thank you so much for coming.

08:27.465 --> 08:30.927
I know Frank will appreciate it,
but I need to get some air. Sorry.

08:31.010 --> 08:35.264
Damn. I could get right with the IRS
if I had her.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.599
Hands off!

08:36.682 --> 08:38.559
We're in the PTA together.

08:38.643 --> 08:39.977
Pussy, Tits, and Ass?

08:40.061 --> 08:43.189
Y'all better not be trying
to unionize on me!

08:44.357 --> 08:45.566
Corkage fee?

08:45.650 --> 08:49.403
Uh, heya, Frank. Going through
a complicated range of emotions?

08:49.487 --> 08:50.821
[Frank] I'm fine, Goom.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.616
Yeah, I was conflicted when I lost my dad.

08:53.699 --> 08:57.328
He got fried when he leaned
on the electric fence he made me piss on.

08:57.411 --> 09:00.706
Ah, bittersweet.
That's how he smelled when it was over.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.083
Leave me alone. I'm fine!

09:02.166 --> 09:04.919
You poor, sad man.

09:05.002 --> 09:07.338
I forgive you for the pants.

09:07.421 --> 09:09.590
Uh... thank you?

09:09.674 --> 09:13.427
So as long as a priest
gives you last rites before you die,

09:13.511 --> 09:16.430
you can do any kind of crap
and still go to heaven?

09:16.514 --> 09:18.015
Everything's forgiven,

09:18.099 --> 09:20.851
except questioning
the rules of forgiveness.

09:20.935 --> 09:24.188
Ugh, I wasted 12 years being good!

09:25.439 --> 09:27.525
Guess what? It's Ash Thursday.

09:27.608 --> 09:30.236
Ah! Ow, there was a lit one in there!

09:31.195 --> 09:32.280
Oh, you're dead!

09:32.363 --> 09:34.240
[yells, crying]

09:34.323 --> 09:37.034
[chuckles] Still wish we'd had kids?

09:38.744 --> 09:42.206
Every moment of every day. [whimpers]

09:42.290 --> 09:44.125
[chuckles]

09:44.208 --> 09:46.627
Ah, that Evelyn, always the joker.

09:46.711 --> 09:47.962
[Evelyn] Baby!

09:48.045 --> 09:49.589
[panting]

09:49.672 --> 09:51.173
I'm gonna kill you!

09:55.177 --> 09:57.179
[Maureen] Holy shit.

09:58.472 --> 10:00.891
This is no place
for an alive little girl to be.

10:00.975 --> 10:04.687
Ah, I'm here for my grandpa's funeral,
and my psycho brother wants to beat me up.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.480
Can I hide with you till he goes away?

10:06.564 --> 10:10.443
Well, I'm doing
some, eh, not-so-pleasant things in here.

10:10.526 --> 10:13.696
I'm not scared.
I've seen dead bodies before.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.157
A guy blew up in front of me
at the airport once.

10:16.240 --> 10:19.285
Ah, yes, that Dunbarton boy.

10:19.368 --> 10:21.370
I was handed a big bag of soup that day.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.956
Went through two whole buckets
of Head Hamburger.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.834
Uh... cool.

10:26.917 --> 10:29.128
Your father was a wonderful man.

10:29.211 --> 10:31.922
The very first thing he said to me was,

10:32.006 --> 10:35.801
"I don't believe you guys have horns
under your little hats."

10:35.885 --> 10:37.595
Oh yeah, he was a peach.

10:38.095 --> 10:40.765
A shitty, rotten peach
that beat me with a crutch.

10:43.267 --> 10:45.102
Don't listen to him.

10:47.438 --> 10:48.981
-Hey, Dad.
-Kevin.

10:49.065 --> 10:52.401
You know, I've been doing
some heavy thinking since Grandpa died,

10:52.485 --> 10:57.073
and I wonder, is there a place in
the cemetery where I can plug in my amp?

10:57.156 --> 10:59.283
-What?
-And... and is there money in the budget

10:59.367 --> 11:01.369
to get suits
for the other guys in the band?

11:01.452 --> 11:03.496
What the fuck are you talking about?

11:03.579 --> 11:06.499
You know, for the song you commissioned me
to sing at the cemetery tomorrow.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.709
-When the hell did I do that?
-On Tuesday!

11:08.793 --> 11:11.796
-Oh, fucking Tuesday.
-You said you were proud of me!

11:11.879 --> 11:13.964
Aw, now you're just making shit up!

11:19.637 --> 11:23.140
I even figured out how to write a bridge.
Fucking cock-knob.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.476
-Oh, hey, Mom.
-I wasn't doing anything.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.854
-What's happening?
-The guy you married is a dildo.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.731
Ugh, Kevin, can you just--

11:30.815 --> 11:32.858
You need to go back in there
and remind him

11:32.942 --> 11:37.738
that he specifically asked me
to write a rocking, uplifting anthem,

11:37.822 --> 11:39.448
"Sky Grandpa."

11:39.532 --> 11:40.825
-And I did--
-Kevin! No!

11:40.908 --> 11:43.869
-But Mom!
-Give your dad a break, okay?

11:44.620 --> 11:46.914
He's going through a lot right now.

11:46.997 --> 11:48.708
He just lost his father.

11:49.375 --> 11:53.045
We all need to set aside our own feelings
and be there for him.

11:54.588 --> 11:57.800
So... are you gonna talk to him
about my song or what?

11:57.883 --> 12:01.178
Kevin, come closer so I can hit you.

12:05.766 --> 12:09.520
Maureen, I've got a surprise
for your face!

12:10.604 --> 12:11.897
[clattering]

12:11.981 --> 12:15.025
Oh, Dad,
I found one of those dead guy suits!

12:15.109 --> 12:18.696
Business in the front,
bathroom in the back!

12:18.779 --> 12:21.574
-That's my boy!
-Hey, Jimmy. Whatcha doing?

12:21.657 --> 12:23.325
Early Christmas shopping.

12:23.409 --> 12:26.245
Wanna hop in and get some dead guy shoes?

12:26.328 --> 12:28.581
Nah, I better keep my clothes nice.

12:28.664 --> 12:32.084
My dad's returning them on Monday
to Irregular Discount Circus of Savings.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.920
Dad, I found
one of those fucking dead dogs

12:37.840 --> 12:40.342
-Oh. Hi, Bill.
-Hey.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.970
When are you gonna realize
what you lost in me?

12:43.053 --> 12:45.639
-I don't care.
-Hey, I'm a catch!

12:45.723 --> 12:48.058
My mom was a 36DD!

12:48.642 --> 12:50.269
Fucking redheaded piece of shit.

12:50.352 --> 12:53.105
I just found out that church is a scam.

12:53.189 --> 12:56.984
You don't have to do good things as long
as you get last rites before you die.

12:57.067 --> 12:59.153
Oh, yeah, I'm banking on that.

12:59.236 --> 13:01.322
It's all about extreme unction.

13:01.405 --> 13:02.782
I'm gonna be a priest.

13:02.865 --> 13:06.535
-I thought you wanted to be a cop.
-I'm gonna be a cop and a priest.

13:06.619 --> 13:11.749
That way I can fuck up all the shit I want
and then forgive myself.

13:11.832 --> 13:15.002
They'll call me
"Officer Father Motherfucker"!

13:15.085 --> 13:17.421
Hey, Dad, I found some apricot wine!

13:17.505 --> 13:20.090
Whatever makes you forget, son.

13:21.717 --> 13:24.428
Your dad was a great man. A saint.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.472
Yeah, thanks. Thanks.

13:26.555 --> 13:29.475
The word "Christlike"
gets thrown around a lot these days,

How much longer do I have to smile
and take this shit?

13:36.482 --> 13:39.360
Big Bill told me
I could have his leg when he died.

13:39.443 --> 13:42.279
It's the wrong size,
but the gesture alone was enough.

13:42.363 --> 13:45.157
He was more of a dad to me
than my own dad.

13:45.241 --> 13:49.161
He paid for my son's bus ticket
to basic training

13:49.245 --> 13:51.163
and his casket coming home.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.499
He was a million laughs at the lodge.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.668
Always singing that beer jingle.

13:55.751 --> 13:58.003
He was an unselfish lover.

13:58.087 --> 14:01.549
He took a dump in the fish tank once
and said, "Look, Lake Erie!"

14:05.261 --> 14:07.721
I could tell
he would've been an unselfish lover.

on this little doozy.

14:21.402 --> 14:23.779
I saw your grandfather in the casket,

14:23.863 --> 14:26.699
and he looked like your dad.

14:26.782 --> 14:30.327
And I just can't imagine life without him.

14:31.203 --> 14:34.164
Wow, I never knew you loved Dad.

Jesus, Kevin!

14:35.749 --> 14:39.086
-Why do you think I married him?
-I don't know, to make him stop yelling?

14:39.169 --> 14:41.630
We love each other very much,

14:41.714 --> 14:44.758
and it really upsets me
that you don't get along with him.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.261
-Hmm, is that why you smoke?
-I don't smoke.

14:47.344 --> 14:49.305
Come on, Mom. We all know.

14:49.388 --> 14:53.309
Fine. There's one pack I keep

He's not really here.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.944
Then where is he? And where's my grandpa?

That's a question that philosophers
have struggled over for centuries.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.367
Some believe in heaven.

Some believe the spirit

I do know that once this gentleman died,
he wasn't in this body anymore.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.670
Because if he was, what I'm doing to him
