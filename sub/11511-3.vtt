00:00.047 --> 00:03.346
- Previously on Game of Silence...
- How you doing, little brother?

00:03.500 --> 00:04.530
I just heard about Darryl.

00:04.540 --> 00:05.893
- What happened?
- Goes back to Quitman.

00:06.573 --> 00:07.540
Quitman?

00:07.540 --> 00:09.101
TERRY: Those kids from the riot.
Little kid Boots,

00:09.111 --> 00:10.460
he sees Darryl in the streets,

00:10.460 --> 00:11.580
he hits him, so I hit back.

00:11.580 --> 00:13.490
Mr. Nolan was represented by a lawyer

00:13.500 --> 00:15.058
named Jackson Brooks.

00:15.068 --> 00:16.712
Jackson.

00:17.335 --> 00:19.965
We build a case, brick by brick,

00:19.975 --> 00:22.122
solid as a rock, and
then we put 'em away.

00:22.132 --> 00:24.004
Bobby, why don't you go on record?

00:24.004 --> 00:26.241
- We got a witness.
- He went on camera

00:26.251 --> 00:28.580
- and he told us everything he saw.
- Bobby, no!

00:28.580 --> 00:31.420
SHAWN: He said the last person he
saw Petey with was the warden.

00:31.420 --> 00:32.490
BOBBY: I wish I could've

00:32.500 --> 00:34.131
- done something else.
- Bravo.

00:34.141 --> 00:35.610
You blamed everybody but yourself.

00:35.620 --> 00:37.550
Poor little Bobby, just doing his job!

00:37.560 --> 00:38.590
The guy's a liar.

00:38.590 --> 00:39.580
How do you know? 'Cause he said

00:39.590 --> 00:41.003
he wasn't at the warden's parties.

00:41.028 --> 00:42.503
You got somewhere to keep this camera?

00:42.528 --> 00:43.595
You gonna leave it with me?

00:43.620 --> 00:45.399
Yeah, I'm gonna leave it with you.
I trust you.

00:45.408 --> 00:46.630
I had some visitors today.

00:46.630 --> 00:47.801
Some of those boys from Quitman.

00:47.801 --> 00:49.620
I just thought you should know.

Jackie boy. What up, brah?

01:44.725 --> 01:46.795
Yeah, I'm just on my way
into court. How you doing?

01:46.805 --> 01:48.755
You know me,
doing my morning constitutional.

01:48.755 --> 01:49.875
Keepin' it right and tight.

01:49.875 --> 01:51.835
I'm gonna stop
by Protective Services today.

01:51.835 --> 01:54.458
I'm gonna see if I can get
some answers on Petey

01:54.483 --> 01:57.362
after he left Quitman.
If we tie this disappearance

01:57.372 --> 01:58.715
to the warden, we're one step closer

01:58.725 --> 01:59.835
to nailing him for murder.

01:59.845 --> 02:02.545
Sounds like a plan.
Anything I can do to help?

02:02.555 --> 02:04.288
Yeah. You can keep an eye on Gil.

02:04.288 --> 02:06.125
Doing this the right way,
it's gonna pay off,

02:06.135 --> 02:07.725
but it's gonna take a little time, so...

02:07.725 --> 02:10.725
- He's got to be impatient, right?
- Hey, don't worry, man.

02:10.725 --> 02:12.685
We got a job today. He'll be fine.

02:12.695 --> 02:14.204
All right. That's good. I got to go.

02:14.214 --> 02:16.725
I'll speak to you later. All right.

02:16.735 --> 02:19.685
- RUBY: Pass me my cornbread, hon.
- DENNIS: All right.

02:19.685 --> 02:20.725
How are things at church?

02:20.725 --> 02:21.885
Everything set for the new soup kitchen?

02:21.885 --> 02:22.915
It's all good, Ma.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.845
The contractor just finished. We will

02:24.855 --> 02:26.745
be open for business tomorrow night.

02:26.755 --> 02:28.805
May I be excused?

02:28.805 --> 02:30.765
- I'm meeting Kendra.
- Yeah, go on, baby.

02:30.775 --> 02:32.166
Don't be out too late.

02:40.725 --> 02:42.735
What about them Quitman boys?

02:42.745 --> 02:44.885
- Don't worry about them.
- Don't worry about it?

02:44.895 --> 02:47.532
Man, you got me buggin'.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.835
What if Darryl's death
was just the beginning?

02:49.845 --> 02:52.351
What if they're trying
to start some kind of war

02:52.376 --> 02:54.685
- with us?
- Calm down.

02:54.695 --> 02:56.217
Look, man, those white-bread

02:56.217 --> 02:58.097
juvenile delinquents
ain't got nothin' on us.

02:58.735 --> 02:59.980
I got it handled.

03:00.695 --> 03:02.202
Now, if you trust me,

03:02.775 --> 03:03.563
you'll be fine.

03:04.725 --> 03:06.551
Yeah, I heard that before.

03:09.805 --> 03:10.895
- Get the money!
- Come on! I'm trying to!

03:10.895 --> 03:12.775
- Go get the money!
- Okay! Okay!

03:12.775 --> 03:14.755
Terry, we got to move!

03:14.765 --> 03:16.695
- Come on... get the money!
- We have to move!

03:16.695 --> 03:17.695
- Go! Come on!
- Hurry!

03:17.695 --> 03:18.815
- Get the money! Come on!
- Okay!

03:18.815 --> 03:21.865
- (sirens wailing)
- (tires screech)

03:23.152 --> 03:24.192
Come on!

03:24.244 --> 03:25.284
(doorbell chimes)

03:25.915 --> 03:29.765
(tires screeching)

03:30.104 --> 03:31.134
- Drop the weapon!
- Hands in the air!

03:31.144 --> 03:33.094
- Step away from each other!
- Put your hands up!

03:33.104 --> 03:34.184
Put the weapon down!

03:34.184 --> 03:36.044
Gun on the ground!

03:36.054 --> 03:37.124
Let me see your hands!

03:37.134 --> 03:40.174
Come on, come on! Put the gun down now!

03:40.184 --> 03:42.144
- It's not worth it!
- Don't move!

03:42.144 --> 03:43.984
(officers shouting)

03:43.984 --> 03:45.984
Gun on the ground!

03:45.984 --> 03:46.984
On the ground!

03:46.984 --> 03:47.964
Don't move!

03:48.184 --> 03:50.024
Don't move!

03:50.024 --> 03:52.040
- Get down.
- Stop. Quit resisting.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.172
Terry, no!

03:53.619 --> 03:57.084
- Terry! Terry!
- Come on!

04:01.228 --> 04:03.530
AARON: Troy Meyer,
former client of mine.

04:03.530 --> 04:05.830
Caught throwing bricks
off a freeway overpass

04:05.830 --> 04:09.154
with his friends, one of which
struck and killed a driver.

04:09.154 --> 04:13.194
Convicted of involuntary
manslaughter in 2012 as a minor.

04:13.344 --> 04:14.454
They gave him eight years?

04:14.454 --> 04:16.374
Yep. Even though I proved at trial

04:16.374 --> 04:18.363
it was another kid
who threw the fatal brick.

04:18.374 --> 04:20.494
- Any priors?
- No. But he turns 19 next week

04:20.494 --> 04:22.414
and juvie loses jurisdiction.

04:22.424 --> 04:24.414
The D.A. wants to send him to Huntsville

04:24.414 --> 04:25.494
to serve out his sentence.

04:25.504 --> 04:28.012
- So it's a certification hearing.
- Exactly. I know

04:28.037 --> 04:29.497
you have a lot of experience with these.

04:29.522 --> 04:30.484
with these. Yeah, I did a bunch

04:30.494 --> 04:32.514
when I was D.A. But I-I hate 'em.

04:32.524 --> 04:35.417
The state has no right
putting kids in adult prison.

04:35.427 --> 04:37.514
I agree. That's why I wanted your help.

04:38.444 --> 04:39.637
That's his parents.

04:40.194 --> 04:41.404
They are not

04:41.414 --> 04:42.270
going to be happy to see me.

04:43.510 --> 04:44.590
Shall we?

04:45.424 --> 04:46.712
JACKSON: These hearings,

04:46.737 --> 04:49.104
they're pretty straightforward.
There's no jury,

04:49.104 --> 04:50.844
just a judge. He's gonna
make the final decision.

04:50.918 --> 04:53.951
I've done a lot of these. I need
you to sit at the front, smile.

04:54.624 --> 04:56.498
The judge is gonna
be watching you, okay?

04:56.838 --> 04:59.838
Honey. Honey. Oh, baby. (crying)

05:01.534 --> 05:03.704
- You're beautiful.
- Sit down, okay?

05:05.141 --> 05:06.306
How you doing, Troy?

05:07.301 --> 05:09.648
I'm sorry, do I know you?

05:09.875 --> 05:11.025
Why are you talking to me
like I know you?

05:11.155 --> 05:13.015
- Who the hell is this?
- Uh, this is Jackson.

05:13.502 --> 05:15.295
I'm Marina. Remember Aaron?

05:15.305 --> 05:17.265
We're the lawyers who are gonna
keep you out of Huntsville,

05:17.275 --> 05:19.275
so easy on the attitude.

05:19.275 --> 05:22.235
I know you're scared,
Troy. That's normal.

05:23.152 --> 05:24.755
But we're here to help you,

05:24.780 --> 05:27.120
so you need to cooperate
and do exactly what we say.

05:27.514 --> 05:28.691
Are we clear?

05:34.205 --> 05:35.738
Yeah, we're clear.

05:36.355 --> 05:37.515
Good man.

05:38.275 --> 05:41.699
All right, let's start
with your final eval.

06:02.365 --> 06:03.759
(click)

06:04.285 --> 06:05.967
You weren't gonna leave
without saying good-bye,

06:05.992 --> 06:07.053
were you, Bobby?

06:10.676 --> 06:14.649
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

06:16.230 --> 06:17.230
So, what do you think?

06:17.240 --> 06:19.180
We have got our work cut out for us.

06:19.190 --> 06:21.130
I wish he'd stayed out
of trouble in juvie.

06:21.140 --> 06:23.300
I'm not worried. I mean, he
looks a little different now,

06:23.310 --> 06:25.676
but there's still
a scared little kid in there.

06:25.676 --> 06:27.070
Were we meeting the same person?

06:27.095 --> 06:28.300
We need to humanize him.

06:28.310 --> 06:30.190
The D.A.'s gonna paint him out
to be a monster,

06:30.200 --> 06:31.350
but that's not who he was
when he went in.

06:31.360 --> 06:34.363
Juvie did that. Huntsville's
gonna make him worse.

06:34.373 --> 06:36.210
You sure we should focus
on the rehab element?

06:36.220 --> 06:37.350
The case law is not very helpful.

06:37.350 --> 06:40.290
Gonna handle that in closing.
But I want you to take direct.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.230
I want you to hit
that juvie record head-on.

06:42.230 --> 06:45.220
Make sure he tells the judge
exactly why he did what he did.

06:45.230 --> 06:46.350
All right?

06:46.360 --> 06:48.843
- Take this.
- What's this?

06:48.853 --> 06:50.258
Have Laurie take his parents
over to Culwell's.

06:50.283 --> 06:51.663
I want to get him a suit.

06:52.003 --> 06:53.360
White shirt, blue tie.
We're gonna need it

06:53.360 --> 06:55.260
by this afternoon for the hearing.

06:55.270 --> 06:57.340
- And where are you going?
- I got to go to the Federal Building

06:57.350 --> 06:59.260
on another case. But, guys, we got this.

06:59.270 --> 07:01.310
There is no way that kid's going
to Huntsville on our watch.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.655
All right? I'll be back.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.360
- (knocking)
- PAM: Dennis, you in here?

07:12.360 --> 07:14.260
- Hey, Pam.
- Another invoice

07:14.270 --> 07:16.381
from the contractor on the soup kitchen.

07:16.406 --> 07:18.029
90 days past due.

07:19.170 --> 07:20.541
All right, I'll take care of it.

07:21.001 --> 07:22.401
That's what you said at 60.

07:22.768 --> 07:24.788
And the opening's tonight,
so I really feel like

07:24.813 --> 07:26.073
- we need to get...
- I'm on it, Pam.

07:28.458 --> 07:29.391
Thank you.

07:31.315 --> 07:32.141
Okay.

07:41.031 --> 07:41.933
JESSIE: Excuse me.

07:43.031 --> 07:45.050
- Can I help you?
- Oscar Salcido,

07:45.060 --> 07:47.405
Houston PD.
I work with Detective Winters.

07:47.430 --> 07:49.036
I'm looking for Gil Harris.

07:49.316 --> 07:50.686
He's my boyfriend.

07:51.091 --> 07:52.394
What are you, um...

07:52.648 --> 07:53.856
Well, I was hoping to speak with him.

07:53.881 --> 07:56.638
According to the building
department, this is his office.

07:56.648 --> 07:58.236
Right. Well, he's out on a job.

07:58.588 --> 08:00.658
- This about Boots?
- Actually, no.

08:00.658 --> 08:02.937
I'm investigating the
murder of Darryl Williams.

08:02.962 --> 08:05.638
- Who?
- Darryl Williams. Do you know him?

08:05.648 --> 08:08.227
No. What would Gil know about that?

08:08.237 --> 08:09.662
Do you know where Mr. Harris was, uh,

08:09.687 --> 08:11.042
three nights ago, between

08:11.067 --> 08:14.048
- midnight and 3:00 a.m.?
- Yeah, he was home.

08:14.578 --> 08:15.517
Just like every other night.

08:16.444 --> 08:17.076
Okay.

08:17.708 --> 08:19.131
Still driving a gray pickup?

08:19.964 --> 08:21.114
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

08:21.698 --> 08:23.101
Any idea where that job site is today?

08:23.222 --> 08:25.212
Uh, yeah, he's on a remodel.

08:25.222 --> 08:27.768
It's end of Lakeview Drive
out in West U.

08:27.795 --> 08:28.944
Yeah.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.230
- I won't keep you then.
- Okay.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.340
- Thank you for your time.
- No problem.

08:38.697 --> 08:40.230
GIL (recorded):
Didn't answer for a reason.

08:40.240 --> 08:43.360
- So leave a message.
- Gil, where the hell you at?

08:43.360 --> 08:45.280
Demo days, we come to work early.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.410
It's time to put up the drywall
and you pull a no-show.

08:47.410 --> 08:50.290
You don't get down like that.
Come on, brah.

08:50.290 --> 08:51.582
Get your ass over here.

08:52.359 --> 08:54.390
You better have a good reason
for being late.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.200
(shouts) What's the matter,

08:56.210 --> 08:57.516
- Bobby? Not happy to see me?
- I told you

08:57.526 --> 08:58.370
I'm sorry.

08:58.370 --> 09:00.210
I know, I know, I know,
I know, you're sorry.

09:00.210 --> 09:01.727
So you feel better now
you cleared your conscience?

09:01.737 --> 09:03.125
What do you want? What
do you want from me?!

09:03.150 --> 09:04.390
I want the truth, Bobby!

09:04.400 --> 09:07.400
All of it! (panting)

09:07.410 --> 09:10.330
I told you everything
on the tape yesterday.

09:10.330 --> 09:13.210
- No, no, no, no, no, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.093
No, you didn't. You did not.
Not about the warden's parties.

09:16.103 --> 09:18.250
Right? What'd you say
about the warden's parties,

09:18.250 --> 09:20.360
- the ones he would throw late at night?
- I don't know anything about...

09:20.370 --> 09:21.320
(shouts)

09:21.330 --> 09:23.190
Come on, Bobby. Think, Bobby.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.230
- Think! It was you! It was you!
- No.

09:25.240 --> 09:28.220
Who'd come get me out of my bed.
You'd take me there yourself.

09:28.220 --> 09:29.420
- Yes. Yes, Bobby. Look at me.
- (groaning)

09:29.420 --> 09:32.260
I blocked a lot of it out
because I had to survive.

09:32.260 --> 09:34.250
But I know you were there.

09:34.260 --> 09:35.780
I never went inside.
I never went inside.

09:35.790 --> 09:37.095
Stop lying! Come on! Stop lying!

09:37.120 --> 09:38.665
Hand to God, I never went inside!

09:40.210 --> 09:43.300
Listen, you don't understand.

09:43.300 --> 09:45.511
I got a bullet traveled
28 years to get here.

09:45.536 --> 09:47.380
(groans)

09:47.380 --> 09:50.017
So you either tell me

09:51.220 --> 09:52.761
what happened,

09:54.300 --> 09:55.753
everything,

09:56.113 --> 09:57.688
- or I'm gonna blow the left ear
- Oh, God.

09:57.713 --> 09:59.400
- out the right side of your brain
- Please...

09:59.410 --> 10:01.420
and leave you for the
maggots to find, okay?

10:01.420 --> 10:04.340
- (crying)
- What do you think, Bobby?

10:04.340 --> 10:06.340
You want to talk?

10:09.210 --> 10:11.350
- What year was that again?
- '88.

10:11.350 --> 10:15.350
All foster care records
for Harris County in 1988.

10:15.350 --> 10:18.414
'86, '87, '88.

10:20.811 --> 10:21.941
Thank you.

10:22.731 --> 10:24.393
No food or liquids near the files.

10:24.403 --> 10:26.212
For God's sakes, put 'em back
where you found 'em.

10:26.222 --> 10:28.881
- I got a system here, okay?
- I appreciate it. Thanks so much.

10:33.751 --> 10:35.316
(door opens)

10:36.731 --> 10:38.220
(door shuts)

10:53.911 --> 10:56.058
No foster transfer...

10:56.702 --> 10:58.212
and no death certificate.

11:29.711 --> 11:31.711
♪ ♪

11:48.256 --> 11:49.331
Laurie.

11:50.062 --> 11:51.654
Can you call the assessor's
office, see if Chuck

11:51.679 --> 11:53.545
and Lorraine Cooper still
live at that address, please?

11:53.659 --> 11:55.659
Yeah, no problem.
Um, your client Ms. West

11:55.659 --> 11:57.649
is waiting in your office.

11:59.549 --> 12:00.431
Thank you.

12:05.589 --> 12:06.460
Hey.

12:06.699 --> 12:08.699
Hey. Sorry, I, uh, I just
needed to talk to you

12:08.699 --> 12:10.768
and I-I thought if I
said I was your client...

12:10.875 --> 12:12.025
It's okay, it's okay. What's wrong?

12:12.035 --> 12:14.045
Detective Winters is what's wrong.

12:14.055 --> 12:16.025
Her partner came by looking for Gil,

12:16.035 --> 12:17.085
wanting to talk to him about

12:17.143 --> 12:19.163
the murder of some guy
named Darryl Williams.

12:19.173 --> 12:21.237
- Who the hell is that?
- It's fine,

12:21.262 --> 12:24.844
calm down. Darryl Williams
is the guy Boots attacked, okay?

12:24.843 --> 12:26.469
What does Gil have to do with that?

12:26.479 --> 12:27.833
I don't know. Did you ask him?

12:27.843 --> 12:30.873
Yes. I've been calling him all
morning, He's not answering,

12:30.883 --> 12:33.657
so I'm worried. What,
does he need a lawyer?

12:33.693 --> 12:34.843
No, of course not, no.
I'm sure he doesn't

12:34.853 --> 12:37.067
have anything to do with it,
Jessie. It's fine.

12:37.077 --> 12:38.793
- Okay?
- Then what's going on?

12:38.803 --> 12:39.863
What are you guys up to?

12:39.873 --> 12:42.833
- We're not up to anything, Jessie.
- Really?

12:43.923 --> 12:46.923
So Boots just beats up some
random guy on the street...

12:46.923 --> 12:49.833
and then Boots dies, and now
Gil's under investigation

12:49.843 --> 12:52.172
for the murder of the guy
that Boots beat up.

12:52.197 --> 12:52.703
Okay, Jes...

12:52.713 --> 12:53.994
And I'm just supposed to think
that that's a coincidence?

12:54.019 --> 12:55.693
Jessie, the cops know

12:55.693 --> 12:56.733
we were all friends with Boots.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.906
They're just covering their bases.
It is fine.

12:58.940 --> 13:00.986
There's more to it, and you
know it. What aren't you

13:00.986 --> 13:03.101
- telling me?
- That's all you need to know, Jessie.

13:03.126 --> 13:05.116
That means there's something
I do need to know...

13:05.126 --> 13:06.128
Why do you keep hiding things from me?

13:06.153 --> 13:07.420
Because I'm trying
to protect you, Jessie.

13:07.445 --> 13:09.107
- I'm trying to protect...
- Trying to protect yours...

13:09.132 --> 13:10.529
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

13:10.539 --> 13:11.921
Uh, we had a meeting, but...

13:11.946 --> 13:14.793
No, it's fine, it's fine. Come in. Uh,

13:14.803 --> 13:16.349
Marina, this is... this is Jessie West.

13:16.359 --> 13:17.213
She's an old friend.

13:17.466 --> 13:18.913
- Great to meet you.
- Hi.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.619
Jessie, this is Marina.
She's a partner at the firm

13:20.629 --> 13:22.950
and... and my fiancée.

13:24.853 --> 13:26.183
Fi-Fiancée?

13:26.193 --> 13:27.573
- Yeah.
- Wow. (laughs)

13:28.347 --> 13:29.737
- Yeah.
- That's great.

13:29.747 --> 13:31.127
I mean, congratulations.

13:31.127 --> 13:32.397
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

13:32.397 --> 13:33.477
Uh, uh, Jessie just came by,

13:33.487 --> 13:35.397
she wanted some legal advice,
she's having trouble

13:35.407 --> 13:37.397
with her landlord at the café, so...

13:37.407 --> 13:39.777
Well, you came to the
right guy. I-I have to say,

13:39.787 --> 13:41.745
it is so nice to meet an
old friend of Jackson's.

13:41.745 --> 13:44.449
I was beginning to think his
past was one big secret.

13:45.417 --> 13:47.634
Well, I'm so sorry, but I have to go.

13:47.634 --> 13:49.054
Um, I'll talk to you later.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.487
- Thank you so much for...
- Absolutely.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.367
Later, yeah.
It was really nice meeting you.

13:52.367 --> 13:53.447
You, too. Okay. All right, bye.

13:53.447 --> 13:56.357
- Thanks for dropping by, Jess, thank you.
- Bye, thank you.

13:57.983 --> 14:00.144
- What'd you say her name was?
- Donna Curtis.

14:00.169 --> 14:03.943
She's, uh, Petey's...
Peter's biological mother.

14:03.953 --> 14:06.883
And now after all this time
she wants to meet him?

14:06.893 --> 14:08.736
- Well, I'll be.
- Yeah. As her attorney,

14:08.746 --> 14:10.933
I'm just helping her locate
him. The foster care records

14:10.943 --> 14:13.472
show that, uh, he lived
with you, here, uh,

14:13.482 --> 14:15.519
until he went to juvie
in 1988. Is that right?

14:15.529 --> 14:16.973
Caught him for stealing fireworks.

14:16.983 --> 14:18.983
I still think they got the wrong boy.

14:18.993 --> 14:22.033
And did he return here after
he finished his sentence?

14:22.043 --> 14:24.023
Oh, I wish he had.

14:24.033 --> 14:26.460
I loved that boy like he was my own.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.033
My husband Chuck, God rest his soul,

14:29.033 --> 14:30.993
he went up to Quitman to get him

14:30.993 --> 14:33.933
after he'd done his time,
but he was gone.

14:33.943 --> 14:34.993
He was gone... he, uh...

14:34.993 --> 14:37.375
he had left before your husband arrived?

14:37.385 --> 14:39.993
The warden said he'd been
violent during his time there,

14:40.003 --> 14:42.499
so the state put him in a special group.

14:42.509 --> 14:45.913
Oh, the warden gave us a final payment

14:45.913 --> 14:46.929
for all our trouble

14:46.954 --> 14:50.057
and Chuck said he wanted that
to be the end of it.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.321
A final payment from the warden?

14:52.883 --> 14:54.577
Mm-hmm, that's what my husband said.

14:54.775 --> 14:57.854
Truth is, we had more kids
than we could handle back then.

14:58.467 --> 15:00.750
So I thought Peter was better off

15:00.760 --> 15:02.715
staying in the care of the state.

15:03.043 --> 15:06.476
I sure hope he's leading
a real nice life now.

15:06.486 --> 15:09.033
I'm sure he is. I want to thank you

15:09.043 --> 15:11.316
for your time and your hospitality.

15:11.326 --> 15:12.393
Thanks so much.

15:15.238 --> 15:17.086
I'll be honest,
I didn't know the hospital

15:17.111 --> 15:18.594
offered a grief counseling service.

15:18.604 --> 15:19.398
Mm-hmm.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.237
I'm glad you called.

15:21.237 --> 15:24.331
The loss of a loved one
can be tough to deal with alone.

15:25.207 --> 15:26.229
How you holding up?

15:27.488 --> 15:30.573
Well... as you can see, not great.

15:31.348 --> 15:34.142
I find it helps to talk about the loss.

15:34.538 --> 15:36.420
Tell me about your husband.

15:37.057 --> 15:38.187
What was he like?

15:38.478 --> 15:39.861
(chuckles softly)

15:39.886 --> 15:41.168
He was funny.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.768
He was... caring.

15:45.538 --> 15:46.929
And smart.

15:47.874 --> 15:48.866
Loving.

15:50.358 --> 15:52.766
At least I thought
he was all those things.

15:52.776 --> 15:55.696
Well, if you felt that way about
him, it must have been true.

15:56.014 --> 15:57.985
Then why would he have
done something like this?

15:58.530 --> 16:01.155
He wasn't violent. He didn't hate.

16:01.776 --> 16:02.876
He was a kind man.

16:03.153 --> 16:04.232
Good man.

16:16.444 --> 16:18.200
Sometimes a good man is...

16:18.944 --> 16:21.179
capable of doing a bad thing.

16:21.554 --> 16:23.544
(distorted shouting)

16:27.564 --> 16:30.434
What's important is that
we forgive our loved ones

16:30.444 --> 16:31.543
for their sins.

16:32.434 --> 16:33.676
That's the problem.

16:35.434 --> 16:38.494
I can find a way to forgive Boots.

16:40.464 --> 16:42.852
I just don't know
if I can ever forgive myself.

16:46.424 --> 16:49.354
He picked up an extra shift

16:49.354 --> 16:50.701
the day he was arrested.

16:51.464 --> 16:53.554
He didn't even want to go to Houston,

16:53.564 --> 16:55.404
but I made him.

16:58.024 --> 17:00.527
I told him we needed the money
for the baby.

17:03.184 --> 17:06.174
He'd still be here if it wasn't for me.

17:08.034 --> 17:09.144
MAN: And most recently,

17:09.154 --> 17:12.124
in November of 2015,
you got another six weeks

17:12.134 --> 17:14.023
in disciplinary seclusion.
Is that correct?

17:14.023 --> 17:14.807
Yes, sir.

17:14.817 --> 17:16.517
And that was for fighting again, too?

17:16.527 --> 17:17.598
I guess so.

17:17.624 --> 17:18.609
You guess so?

17:18.619 --> 17:20.685
Did you or did you not
hit another inmate

17:20.685 --> 17:22.636
with a metal tray in the cafeteria?

17:23.868 --> 17:24.897
Yeah, I hit him.

17:26.138 --> 17:27.898
One more question, Mr. Meyer.

17:28.730 --> 17:31.647
Is that a 210 gang tattoo on your neck?

17:34.799 --> 17:35.899
Doesn't mean anything.

17:35.909 --> 17:37.779
Did you become affiliated with a gang

17:37.789 --> 17:39.101
- while you were incarcerated?
- No, I did not.

17:39.111 --> 17:41.758
- So you just liked the way it looked.
- Objection. Argumentative.

17:41.768 --> 17:43.236
Withdrawn. Pass the witness.

17:50.180 --> 17:52.350
MARINA: You've had a rough time
in juvie, haven't you, Troy?

17:52.861 --> 17:53.882
Yes.

17:54.250 --> 17:56.350
How old were you when you were arrested?

17:56.360 --> 17:57.915
I was 14.

17:57.925 --> 18:00.280
Had you ever been in trouble
with the law before that?

18:00.290 --> 18:01.400
No, ma'am.

18:01.410 --> 18:04.605
These disciplinary incidents
that Mr. Watson mentioned...

18:04.615 --> 18:06.310
tell the court about those.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.320
(exhales) Uh...

18:10.340 --> 18:12.370
When I, uh, when I first got there,

18:12.370 --> 18:15.400
it was like I was immediately a target.

18:15.410 --> 18:17.410
You know, all the kids
just kept picking on me

18:17.410 --> 18:19.320
all the time. That was the whole reason

18:19.330 --> 18:21.598
I went to rec in the first
place, was to get stronger

18:21.598 --> 18:22.845
so that I could protect myself.

18:23.105 --> 18:23.985
Did that work?

18:24.435 --> 18:27.057
No, they just kept coming. First time,

18:27.082 --> 18:28.791
these guys cornered me in my bunk

18:28.801 --> 18:30.928
and I was just defending myself.
I got seclusion.

18:31.095 --> 18:34.583
Second time, they tried stealing
my chits and I fought back

18:34.629 --> 18:37.269
and boom, I got four weeks
for that, so then I-I was done.

18:37.279 --> 18:40.370
That's it... then I just... I, um...

18:40.380 --> 18:41.683
What?

18:42.760 --> 18:43.686
It's okay.

18:44.890 --> 18:46.760
Well, the third and fourth times

18:46.770 --> 18:47.840
I started the fight.

18:47.850 --> 18:49.327
Why would you do that?

18:51.310 --> 18:52.445
I don't know.

18:52.470 --> 18:53.885
Yes, you do, Troy.

18:54.527 --> 18:56.667
Was it because seclusion
was the only place

18:56.677 --> 18:58.236
they couldn't get to you...

18:58.236 --> 19:00.677
the only place that you felt safe?

19:03.657 --> 19:04.849
Yeah.

19:05.657 --> 19:07.792
And why do you have that tattoo?

19:11.697 --> 19:13.176
They said that, uh...

19:14.647 --> 19:17.221
if I don't, if I don't
let them give it to me...

19:17.231 --> 19:19.561
then they're just gonna keep
beating me every day.

19:20.607 --> 19:23.073
They said that it's worse
at Huntsville, and I'm...

19:23.894 --> 19:25.944
I'm sorry, Judge, I'm sorry.
I don't want to go.

19:25.944 --> 19:28.824
I don't want to go to Huntsville. I'm...

19:28.824 --> 19:30.707
I don't want to be locked up anymore.

19:38.744 --> 19:39.814
Mr. Cook.

19:39.824 --> 19:41.764
Detective Salcido, Houston PD.

19:41.774 --> 19:42.854
Got a minute?

19:42.864 --> 19:44.784
Oh, no worries, bro. I got

19:44.794 --> 19:45.894
the building permit around
here somewhere, hang on.

19:45.904 --> 19:47.874
I just got a few questions
for you and your partner

19:47.874 --> 19:48.954
regarding Darryl Williams.

19:49.887 --> 19:51.278
My partner's not here.

19:51.288 --> 19:53.954
We have a witness that placed
a gray crew cab pickup truck

19:53.964 --> 19:56.734
outside Darryl's home
the night he was killed.

19:58.954 --> 20:00.259
What does that have to do with us?

20:00.284 --> 20:02.764
Well, witness ID'd two men
inside... one black, one white.

20:03.365 --> 20:05.882
You guys told my partner that
you were all home that night.

20:06.782 --> 20:08.127
Care to revise that story?

20:08.795 --> 20:10.355
Or shall I have a black and white

20:10.365 --> 20:12.325
- find Mr. Williams, bring him...
- I get it, I get it, all right?

20:13.325 --> 20:16.217
We were there. But we never
got out of the truck.

20:17.295 --> 20:18.475
Listen, I'm gonna keep it 100% with you.

20:18.485 --> 20:21.325
I'm not saying we didn't think
about doing something.

20:21.335 --> 20:22.673
But we didn't.

20:23.285 --> 20:25.455
We sat there for ten
minutes and then we left.

20:25.455 --> 20:28.295
Went over to Blanco's and had
a few beers before they closed.

20:28.305 --> 20:30.335
- And after that?
- After that what?

20:30.345 --> 20:31.980
G took me to the crib
and we called it a night.

20:32.005 --> 20:33.486
So it's possible Mr. Harris went back?

20:33.511 --> 20:35.415
No, he wouldn't have done that.

20:35.415 --> 20:36.896
You seem fairly certain.

20:36.906 --> 20:38.455
Yeah, 'cause I know the man.

20:38.455 --> 20:39.844
Better than anyone else.

20:40.455 --> 20:41.928
We go way back.

20:42.495 --> 20:44.136
WOMAN: I knew this was a mistake.

20:44.136 --> 20:46.038
We should turn around and
move right back to Atlanta.

20:46.063 --> 20:47.455
We've only been here a week.

20:47.465 --> 20:49.454
And I have yet to see
another black person.

20:50.184 --> 20:52.778
Can't even get away
from one of the neighbors.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.495
MAN: So they're not welcoming
us with open arms.

20:55.495 --> 20:57.002
It takes time.

20:57.002 --> 21:00.415
WOMAN: How much time? How long
we gonna keep Shawny locked in here,

21:00.415 --> 21:02.691
worried he'll be hurt
if he steps outside?

21:05.355 --> 21:06.465
Hi, I'm Shawn Cook.

21:06.475 --> 21:08.617
And my family and I just
moved into the neighborhood,

21:08.642 --> 21:10.968
so I thought I'd take this
opportunity to introduce myself

21:10.978 --> 21:12.465
and make some new friends.

21:12.465 --> 21:13.829
Uh, no.

21:17.265 --> 21:18.455
Hi, I'm Shawn. My family and I

21:18.465 --> 21:19.228
- just moved in the neigh...
- I'm not supposed

21:19.238 --> 21:20.683
to talk to strangers.

21:23.455 --> 21:25.075
Hi. I'm Shawn.

21:29.435 --> 21:30.906
(knocking)

21:31.926 --> 21:33.279
Hi. I'm Shawn.

21:33.373 --> 21:34.838
I'm new around here.

21:35.373 --> 21:36.876
And?

21:36.886 --> 21:39.441
And I don't usually get this far.

21:41.248 --> 21:42.701
I saw the moving truck.

21:42.949 --> 21:44.629
Race car bed's a little much, but, uh...

21:44.654 --> 21:45.939
(laughing)

21:45.949 --> 21:48.029
You guys got a humongous TV.

21:48.029 --> 21:50.639
My name's Gil.

21:50.889 --> 21:52.069
You play Nintendo?

21:52.447 --> 21:53.551
Hell, yeah, I do.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.452
All right, well, look, hurry up

21:55.462 --> 21:57.949
before my loser foster mom
gets home and makes us stop.

21:57.959 --> 21:59.119
Awesome!

22:01.939 --> 22:04.939
BOBBY: Wasn't like they were
held every week or anything.

22:04.949 --> 22:07.069
It was just random, you know.

22:07.079 --> 22:09.300
Warden'd call me up in
the afternoon and...

22:09.983 --> 22:12.029
and tell me it was time for
one of his special parties,

22:12.029 --> 22:15.019
and I knew that meant I had to
go and get liquor for everybody.

22:15.029 --> 22:17.392
What do you mean ever-everybody?
Who-who were those other people?

22:18.029 --> 22:20.019
Mostly just the warden's friends.

22:21.890 --> 22:24.069
Sometimes I saw other people go in.

22:24.069 --> 22:26.465
Bigwigs, you know.

22:26.989 --> 22:28.266
Political people.

22:30.405 --> 22:31.743
Then what happened?

22:32.695 --> 22:33.900
What happened?!

22:34.815 --> 22:38.179
Once the party got started,
he'd just call me up,

22:39.068 --> 22:41.178
tell me to send over
some of his favorites.

22:42.218 --> 22:43.322
His favorites?

22:44.131 --> 22:45.163
Yeah.

22:46.011 --> 22:47.491
There were other kids, too.

22:51.407 --> 22:52.815
You really don't remember, do you?

22:52.825 --> 22:54.731
Oh, God...

22:55.815 --> 22:58.645
(sighs)

23:00.655 --> 23:02.075
There were pills.

23:02.695 --> 23:04.587
In the dorms, we had pills.

23:06.344 --> 23:07.735
Wasn't...

23:07.735 --> 23:10.825
There wasn't anything I wanted
to remember about those nights.

23:11.245 --> 23:12.184
Right.

23:12.194 --> 23:13.363
I remember that.

23:14.695 --> 23:16.260
Yeah, sometimes you'd look kind of...

23:16.537 --> 23:18.222
kind of out of it, you know?

23:19.655 --> 23:22.073
Warden must have done
some twisted things...

23:22.083 --> 23:23.558
- (groans)
- ...inside that house.

23:23.568 --> 23:25.747
Kind of things
that give you night sweats now?

23:29.143 --> 23:31.203
Must have been sheer hell.

23:32.308 --> 23:34.934
- How about that, huh?!
- (groans)

23:34.944 --> 23:37.298
- (groans)
- Don't get behind a trigger

23:37.308 --> 23:39.250
you ain't willing to pull, boy!

23:41.178 --> 23:43.528
Now we can get the real party started.

23:48.087 --> 23:51.026
Hey, sis, you hear anything from him?

23:51.186 --> 23:52.346
JESSIE: Nothing.

23:52.346 --> 23:54.146
Shawn, I'm getting really worried.

23:54.146 --> 23:56.677
I mean, should we go out
and look for him?

23:56.687 --> 23:58.484
You know the man as well as I do.

23:58.494 --> 24:00.245
Sometimes he just doesn't want
to be found.

24:00.797 --> 24:02.216
Well, I'm not... I'm not gonna just

24:02.241 --> 24:03.401
sit here and do nothing.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.160
Now, listen, I'll tell you what.

24:05.240 --> 24:08.186
I'll drive around a bit,
stop by some bars.

24:08.196 --> 24:09.620
(sighs) God, I hope he's not

24:09.645 --> 24:11.171
drinking himself to death.

24:11.171 --> 24:12.745
He just... he came home
in a mood last night,

24:12.760 --> 24:14.331
and I never found out why, and then...

24:15.984 --> 24:17.750
he was even awake
in the middle of the night.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.820
And I-I don't know.
I heard this noise, like he was

24:20.830 --> 24:22.750
watching TV or something.

24:22.760 --> 24:25.019
Listen, don't worry, all right?

24:25.019 --> 24:26.266
I'm sure he's fine.

24:26.830 --> 24:29.860
Um, I got to go, but I'll call
you once I hear something.

24:29.870 --> 24:32.870
Yeah. Bye.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.323
Bye.

24:35.720 --> 24:37.720
(sighs)

24:49.309 --> 24:50.335
(sighs)

24:54.297 --> 24:55.909
Not such a big shot now, huh?

24:55.920 --> 24:58.820
I gave you little pricks
everything you wanted yesterday,

24:58.830 --> 24:59.860
but that just wasn't enough.

24:59.870 --> 25:01.499
You take a trip and go to hell.

25:03.027 --> 25:04.940
A shame your memory's so spotty.

25:05.710 --> 25:08.092
Especially when it comes to
the warden's little parties.

25:08.850 --> 25:11.363
Now that I'm thinking about
'em, I remember 'em real well.

25:11.770 --> 25:13.930
I didn't just drop you
kids off and walk away.

25:13.930 --> 25:16.180
Hell, no, I went inside to join the fun.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.298
Yeah, you're damn right.

25:18.810 --> 25:21.324
You kids were there so we
had something to laugh at.

25:21.780 --> 25:23.588
You were monkeys in our cage.

25:24.635 --> 25:27.387
You know, the warden
used to really light up

25:27.740 --> 25:29.363
every time you would come in.

25:29.630 --> 25:32.587
And I always thought you kind of
liked the attention, you know?

25:32.890 --> 25:35.146
I mean, the way you were
smiling in all the pictures.

25:36.770 --> 25:38.497
Oh, you don't remember that, either?

25:39.800 --> 25:41.006
(laughs)

25:41.031 --> 25:43.710
Yeah, my old buddy Red...
he's an excellent photographer.

25:44.482 --> 25:46.456
Took all kinds of pictures of you.

25:47.930 --> 25:49.176
My guess is

25:50.425 --> 25:53.201
that the warden probably still
looks at 'em from time to time,

25:53.228 --> 25:54.621
whenever he gets lonely.

25:55.242 --> 25:57.282
Does that make you feel nice?

25:57.863 --> 26:00.403
Knowing that you're
still keeping him company?

26:01.602 --> 26:02.587
Yeah?

26:03.666 --> 26:05.170
You miss him, don't you?

26:06.659 --> 26:07.907
I bet you do.

26:08.252 --> 26:09.827
Boom.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.322
RAY: Oh, just stop right here.

26:18.914 --> 26:21.272
Nick, my friend,
I've got some personal business

26:21.282 --> 26:24.362
to attend to this afternoon, so
I can handle it from here, son.

26:24.372 --> 26:26.322
- (sighs)
- (door sensor dings)

26:28.754 --> 26:30.794
You have yourself a fine afternoon.

26:30.804 --> 26:32.804
Yes, sir. Thank you very much.

26:56.667 --> 26:58.667
JACKSON: Your Honor, this is a good kid.

26:59.303 --> 27:02.815
He did his best
to do the right thing inside.

27:02.824 --> 27:04.855
He finished his GED.

27:05.310 --> 27:07.859
He worked in the prison library, and now

27:07.869 --> 27:10.410
he dreams of going to college,

27:10.420 --> 27:12.770
just like any one of his peers.

27:14.074 --> 27:17.813
And everything else he did
was about survival.

27:17.996 --> 27:19.906
(yelling)

27:19.942 --> 27:21.338
You can blame him for that.

27:25.135 --> 27:27.486
Troy wasn't a violent person
when he went in.

27:28.519 --> 27:31.151
But he will be if you
send him to Huntsville,

27:31.260 --> 27:32.490
'cause the reality is,

27:33.260 --> 27:35.723
in prison, you're either the perpetrator

27:35.748 --> 27:37.349
or you're the victim.

27:38.960 --> 27:42.470
And no one should ever have to
make that choice, especially not

27:42.470 --> 27:45.463
a 19-year-old kid.

27:46.910 --> 27:48.695
Troy made a mistake.

27:50.708 --> 27:52.438
But he's paid for that mistake.

27:53.668 --> 27:56.638
The system has taken his childhood,

27:56.648 --> 27:58.336
and that is enough.

27:59.839 --> 28:02.335
Don't... take his hope.

28:02.748 --> 28:04.778
Don't take his future,

28:04.788 --> 28:07.815
'cause that is not justice.

28:12.311 --> 28:13.591
Thank you, Your Honor.

28:25.637 --> 28:27.404
Sorry about this, boy,

28:27.638 --> 28:29.653
but you ain't got
no one to blame but yourself.

28:30.816 --> 28:31.837
Can't take the risk of you

28:31.838 --> 28:33.324
finding me again.

28:34.848 --> 28:35.947
You know something?

28:36.848 --> 28:39.638
You kids got everything you deserved.

28:41.718 --> 28:43.254

sent him a kiss good-bye.

have time for this, D.

29:08.898 --> 29:09.712
I'm telling you,

29:09.722 --> 29:12.682
Boots wasn't even supposed
to be in Houston that day.

29:12.692 --> 29:14.264
It was just a coincidence.

29:14.274 --> 29:15.772
A coincidence that sent
Darryl to the hospital,

29:15.782 --> 29:16.812
or did you forget about that?

29:16.822 --> 29:17.872
No, I-I didn't forget that.

29:17.882 --> 29:20.672
Yeah, they beat the crap out of Darryl,

29:20.682 --> 29:22.179
but it wasn't planned.

29:22.426 --> 29:24.443
They are not coming for us.

29:24.453 --> 29:26.383
You don't have to start a war with them.

29:26.393 --> 29:28.692
I didn't start a war with them.

29:28.692 --> 29:30.712
They started this.

29:31.349 --> 29:32.733
I'm just protecting what's mine.

29:32.732 --> 29:34.672
Got to let that go, Terry.

29:35.121 --> 29:36.648

Yeah, but I got out.

31:10.241 --> 31:11.852
That's something
you should think about doing.

31:11.862 --> 31:13.732
You don't just get out.

31:13.742 --> 31:14.832
I let you out.

31:14.832 --> 31:16.662
I vouched for you.

31:16.672 --> 31:17.872
That's how the game go, brah.

31:18.409 --> 31:19.753
What, you think 'cause
you said some fancy words,

31:19.762 --> 31:22.722
put your head in holy water,
something like that,

31:22.732 --> 31:24.561
that you're a changed man now?

31:26.019 --> 31:27.872
Guess again, bro.

31:28.361 --> 31:32.018
We always gonna be the same, D.

31:33.477 --> 31:35.762
It's in our souls, man.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.722
Wouldn't want
to forget my weekly offering

31:42.732 --> 31:44.762
for the collection plate.

31:48.560 --> 31:51.249
Don't matter where it come from,
as long as it do, right?

31:56.453 --> 31:57.813
You're welcome.

32:05.662 --> 32:07.672
♪ ♪

32:29.175 --> 32:30.207
Bobby?

32:36.596 --> 32:38.209
(doorbell rings)

32:39.129 --> 32:40.342
Afternoon, ma'am.

32:40.416 --> 32:41.782
Terry Bausch, Bausch Nursery.

32:41.782 --> 32:43.802
Here about the broken sprinkler.

32:45.852 --> 32:49.762
Huh, I guess I should be
paying more attention.

32:49.772 --> 32:51.230
You think you can fix it?

32:51.240 --> 32:52.827
Yeah, it's actually quite common, ma'am.

32:52.852 --> 32:55.153
All you got to do is
shut the main valve off.

32:55.960 --> 32:57.236
Uh, right.

32:57.246 --> 32:58.732
And that would be where?

32:58.742 --> 33:01.408
Usually they're along the
retaining wall of the property.

33:01.418 --> 33:02.652
Sure.

33:06.662 --> 33:08.662
TERRY: Hmm.

33:08.662 --> 33:10.652
No valve out here.
You all have a basement?

33:10.662 --> 33:11.732
We do.

33:11.742 --> 33:13.652
Well, it's probably down there.

33:13.662 --> 33:14.812
Okay.

33:15.658 --> 33:16.653
Want me to show you?

33:16.662 --> 33:17.732
That'd be great. I can do it for you.

33:17.742 --> 33:18.812
Okay. Thank you.

33:33.257 --> 33:35.187
Jackie, what you doing here?

33:35.187 --> 33:36.267
I called him from the road.

33:36.267 --> 33:37.850
What happened?

33:39.267 --> 33:41.227
Consider that a retainer,
you're my lawyer.

33:41.237 --> 33:42.307
What'd you do, Gil?

33:42.317 --> 33:43.712
Shot Bobby.

33:44.546 --> 33:46.127
You what?

33:46.137 --> 33:47.287
Yeah, I went to go see
that son of a bitch,

33:47.297 --> 33:49.207
and I shot him,
and-and it feels good, Jackie.

33:49.217 --> 33:50.711
- I don't have any regrets.
- You-you feel okay?

33:50.721 --> 33:51.668
- You feel good?
- Yeah.

33:51.668 --> 33:52.502
That's great, man.

33:52.527 --> 33:54.147
- What, are you insane?
- What?

33:54.147 --> 33:57.307
Cops find out, you go to prison,
we all go to prison.

33:57.307 --> 33:58.928
SHAWN: Jackie, relax.

33:58.938 --> 34:00.287
- Relax?
- We ain't stupid, all right?

34:00.297 --> 34:02.207
I helped him clean up the place,

34:02.217 --> 34:04.127
and we got rid of the body. We're good.

34:04.137 --> 34:06.217
You're not stupid, Shawn, you're
just an accessory to murder now!

34:06.227 --> 34:07.297
No one's gonna find out, Jackie!

34:07.307 --> 34:09.217
What are you thinking?
You said you had eyes on him.

34:09.226 --> 34:10.297
I did! I had his back!

34:10.306 --> 34:12.197
That's right, and Shawn saved my ass!

34:12.206 --> 34:13.277
If it wasn't for him, I'd be dead!

34:13.286 --> 34:15.197
Bobby had a gun to my head, Jackie!

34:15.206 --> 34:16.237
That wouldn't have happened

34:16.237 --> 34:17.277
if you weren't there
in the first place, man.

34:17.286 --> 34:18.317
What happened?!

34:18.350 --> 34:20.117
We said we were gonna do this right.

34:20.127 --> 34:21.157
We were gonna do it by the law.

34:21.167 --> 34:22.257
Oh, forget the law!

34:22.266 --> 34:24.177
The law didn't help us at Quitman!

34:24.187 --> 34:25.429
It's not helping us now!

34:25.742 --> 34:27.237
They can't even solve Boots' murder!

34:27.246 --> 34:29.273
I trusted you, man, I trusted you.

34:30.840 --> 34:32.143
That was my mistake.

34:33.197 --> 34:35.926
Ugh, you're still the same, Gil, right?

34:36.197 --> 34:37.277
It's all about you.

34:37.277 --> 34:38.737
- It's all about you.
- What's that supposed to mean?

34:38.737 --> 34:40.117
What's it supposed to mean?

34:40.117 --> 34:41.317
It means you screwed us, all of us.

34:41.317 --> 34:43.317
And you think you won some kind
of personal battle here.

34:43.317 --> 34:45.812
You lost the war for all of us.

34:45.812 --> 34:48.167
We still have a confession on camera!

34:48.167 --> 34:49.246
- Confession?
- Yeah!

34:49.246 --> 34:50.286
From a dead man?!

34:50.286 --> 34:51.722
Think about it.

34:52.286 --> 34:55.018
That looks like we coerced him
into saying something.

34:55.605 --> 34:56.875
That ties us to his murder.

34:56.885 --> 34:58.753
Did you think about that?

35:04.247 --> 35:05.469
Give me the camera.

35:05.469 --> 35:07.258
We need to get rid of it right now.

35:09.962 --> 35:11.042
Get the damn camera, Gil!

35:11.042 --> 35:12.042
I'm getting the camera!

35:12.042 --> 35:13.413
It's in the safe!

35:14.541 --> 35:15.972
(door opens)

35:19.092 --> 35:20.613
Hang-hang on.

35:21.862 --> 35:22.983
It's not here.

35:24.932 --> 35:26.042
What did you say?

35:26.052 --> 35:28.992
- SHAWN: I saw you put it in.
- I-I put it in the safe, I swear.

35:30.237 --> 35:32.082
But you forgot to lock the door.

35:43.371 --> 35:45.401
We never wanted to hurt you.

35:46.321 --> 35:48.241
We just thought that if-if you knew

35:48.241 --> 35:49.321
what really happened, that...

35:49.321 --> 35:51.421
Yeah, but all these years...

35:53.789 --> 35:55.288
...I mean, I always
assumed that, you know,

35:55.789 --> 35:57.709
it was horrible at Quitman,

35:57.709 --> 36:02.000
and I... saw how you guys
changed when you got out,

36:02.071 --> 36:02.960
and...

36:04.414 --> 36:07.209
...just nothing I ever imagined

36:07.536 --> 36:11.200
was as horrible as what
I heard on that tape.

36:11.456 --> 36:13.834
Look, sis, we got through it together.

36:14.537 --> 36:16.127
But why didn't you tell me?

36:21.483 --> 36:23.657
JESSIE: What, it's not...
it's not like I would have felt

36:23.667 --> 36:25.075
any differently about you guys,

36:25.085 --> 36:26.925
it just would have
made me love you more.

36:27.974 --> 36:30.540
I mean, for God's sakes, it
was my mom who was drunk.

36:30.565 --> 36:32.597
The only reason you guys were
even there in the first place

36:32.607 --> 36:34.082
is because you were protecting me.

36:34.092 --> 36:35.955
JACKSON: We agreed never
to speak about it.

36:37.635 --> 36:39.476
It was the only way to get through it.

36:39.487 --> 36:40.657
SHAWN: And it worked.

36:41.187 --> 36:43.083
For a long time.

36:43.193 --> 36:44.263
(sighs)

36:44.326 --> 36:46.728
Till Boots ran into Darryl.

36:49.627 --> 36:51.537
So Darryl's murder was...

36:51.547 --> 36:52.512
GIL: No.

36:53.497 --> 36:55.396
We had nothing to do with that.

36:55.978 --> 36:58.811
But you had something to do with
this Bobby Marks guy, right?

36:59.467 --> 37:01.316
Was he the first one?

37:02.477 --> 37:05.647
Some sort of revenge plot
you guys got going?

37:05.657 --> 37:06.741
I mean, what's next?

37:06.873 --> 37:07.943
There's no next.

37:24.401 --> 37:25.657
I'm out.

37:27.003 --> 37:28.093
DENNIS: The Lord has blessed us

37:28.103 --> 37:30.775
as we gather together
to celebrate today.

37:31.461 --> 37:34.084
This new kitchen will not only provide

37:34.093 --> 37:36.003
for the congregation of our good church

37:36.013 --> 37:39.043
but will allow us to do God's
work throughout the community.

37:39.053 --> 37:41.043
(congregation affirms)

37:41.053 --> 37:42.957
This truly is a good day.

37:43.938 --> 37:44.661
I want to thank you.

37:44.671 --> 37:47.289
Thank you all so much
for your hard work.

37:48.754 --> 37:50.083
Now, let's get cooking.

37:50.093 --> 37:51.103
(congregation affirms)

37:51.113 --> 37:53.163
Hey, psst.

37:53.163 --> 37:56.063
Tough guy to pin down, man.

37:56.073 --> 37:58.163
Yeah, you know, man, planning...

37:58.163 --> 38:00.083
The rest of my money, Dennis.

38:00.083 --> 38:02.043
Otherwise, the stove goes
back on the truck.

38:02.043 --> 38:04.083
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

38:06.769 --> 38:07.849
Thanks.

38:07.909 --> 38:09.769
See you around. All right, brother.

38:18.173 --> 38:19.887
Are you gonna leave me?

38:21.093 --> 38:22.216
What?

38:24.043 --> 38:25.113
No.

38:25.123 --> 38:27.123
I took a man's life today.

38:30.682 --> 38:33.193
But I didn't, I didn't go there
to kill him.

38:37.842 --> 38:39.204
I just needed answers.

38:41.811 --> 38:43.204
You know?

38:43.213 --> 38:47.203
(sniffles) Oh, God, there's
so much I haven't told you.

38:47.649 --> 38:49.984
I don't care, you can tell me anything.

38:51.313 --> 38:54.053
Anything, okay?

38:55.223 --> 38:56.786
I got you.

39:01.634 --> 39:03.213
I want to tell you.

39:10.033 --> 39:12.023
Bobby Marks was the guard at Quitman

39:12.023 --> 39:14.123
who would come get me
out of my bunk late at night.

39:20.033 --> 39:24.123
He would... take me to these parties.

39:25.233 --> 39:27.103
- (beeps)
- WOMAN: Hey, sweetie, it's Deb.

39:27.113 --> 39:29.183
I'll be at Lola's tonight if you
want to join me for a drink.

39:29.193 --> 39:31.023
- You owe me one.
- (beeps)

39:31.033 --> 39:33.023
WOMAN 2: Hey, haven't
seen you in a while.

39:33.033 --> 39:34.193
Call me back, let me know
how you're doing.

39:34.203 --> 39:36.053
(beeps)

39:44.153 --> 39:46.153
(phone line rings)

39:48.163 --> 39:49.233
Hey.

39:50.003 --> 39:51.073
It's me, Shawn.

39:52.289 --> 39:53.073
Hi.

39:53.554 --> 39:55.074
Is everything okay?

39:55.083 --> 39:56.193
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

39:57.106 --> 40:00.123
Just wanted to make sure
that you're okay.

40:05.113 --> 40:07.273
I miss him, too.

40:12.073 --> 40:14.073
Marina, I'm home!

40:18.586 --> 40:19.626
Baby?

40:21.163 --> 40:23.083
MARINA: Hey, you.

40:23.083 --> 40:24.649
Hey. Congratulations.

40:25.003 --> 40:26.003
What for?

40:26.013 --> 40:27.083
We won.

40:27.093 --> 40:29.233
Judge Harris denied certification.

40:29.267 --> 40:32.003
Troy's getting out tomorrow,
two years supervised parole.

40:32.003 --> 40:33.620
That is amazing.

40:35.083 --> 40:37.163
You were awesome in there today.

40:37.661 --> 40:39.084
So were you.

40:39.373 --> 40:40.753
Do you want to go out to celebrate?

40:40.800 --> 40:41.532
No.

40:44.003 --> 40:45.163
I just want to be here with you.

40:45.905 --> 40:47.672
I want to cook.

40:48.709 --> 40:50.003
- What?
- Yeah, I'm gonna cook for you.

40:50.003 --> 40:51.163
- (laughs)
- Go have a shower.

40:51.163 --> 40:53.163
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
whip you up something.

40:53.982 --> 40:55.163
What's, uh, what's this?

40:55.163 --> 40:57.618
MARINA: Uh, the nursery guy
left that for you.

40:57.618 --> 40:59.591
It's the bid on the landscaping
in the backyard.

40:59.591 --> 41:00.788
The... the nursery guy?

41:00.798 --> 41:02.133
Yeah, he fixed that sprinkler.

41:02.143 --> 41:03.588
He had to come in and
shut off the water,

41:03.598 --> 41:04.841
but it was no big deal.

41:04.851 --> 41:06.153
I'm so sorry I didn't notice it.

41:19.074 --> 41:20.230
Hey.

41:20.230 --> 41:22.190
You seem tired,

41:22.201 --> 41:24.237
so why don't we just get takeout
and watch a movie or something?

41:24.262 --> 41:26.713
Yeah, yeah, takeout sounds great.

41:28.271 --> 41:30.311
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing.

41:30.311 --> 41:31.319
That's-that's not what I thought it was.

41:31.344 --> 41:32.539
Takeout is perfect.

41:34.853 --> 41:35.853
Go have a shower.

41:35.853 --> 41:36.883
I got it.

41:37.494 --> 41:38.439
Go.
