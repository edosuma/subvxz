WEBVTT

00:05.306 --> 00:07.172
So where did you find
that hack?

00:07.274 --> 00:10.442
I did my research and Dr.
Highland is very well respected.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.511
Grace, if you're not gonna get

00:12.613 --> 00:16.815
any help for these mood swings
or whatever this is, then,

00:16.917 --> 00:20.119
I just don't think
I can go on with things.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.621
I need to do
what's best for me,

00:22.723 --> 00:24.656
so that I can keep my sanity.

00:24.759 --> 00:26.892
So you wanna leave me, Harvey?

00:29.797 --> 00:31.663
Hahaha! Haha!

00:31.766 --> 00:34.033
A disorder?

00:34.135 --> 00:35.868
Well, that would explain
the highs and lows in your mood.

00:35.970 --> 00:39.838
And it's treatable. It will
make your life easier to manage.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.573
I manage my life
just fine, thank you.

00:41.675 --> 00:44.810
You know how you can
overreact sometimes.

00:44.912 --> 00:46.845
Right? And when that happens,

00:46.947 --> 00:49.481
you can't control yourself.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.402
Two weeks ago,
her friends were visiting

00:51.452 --> 00:54.253
from New York.
That snobby bitch!

00:54.355 --> 00:56.755
You said he just liked it
and bought it on a whim

00:56.857 --> 00:58.737
without knowing anything
about it or the artist.

00:58.826 --> 01:01.026
So I just thought you might want
a little background.

01:01.128 --> 01:03.862
So I'm just the uneducated,
plain folk?

01:03.964 --> 01:05.831
I mean, I think
the fact

01:05.933 --> 01:08.500
that I picked out the picture says
I have pretty damn good taste.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.170
- It is a lovely piece.
- I don't need your condescension.

01:12.940 --> 01:15.574
Grace, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean

01:15.676 --> 01:17.576
to offend you...
You sit there thinking

01:17.678 --> 01:20.746
that you are better than us and
smarter than us - Grace, stop!

01:20.848 --> 01:23.348
She's our guest.
This is just like you

01:23.451 --> 01:25.350
not to be on my side.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.920
Look what you made me do!
You've ruined everything!

01:28.022 --> 01:30.589
She didn't mean that.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.926
- I'm so sorry.
- Grace, you are not alone.

01:34.028 --> 01:36.595
Alright, over 400000 people

01:36.697 --> 01:38.697
suffer from HPD.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.677
I'm sure we can find a way
to make your life much better

01:40.701 --> 01:42.601
if you're willing
to accept treatment.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.738
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,

01:46.841 --> 01:48.874
and I will see you outside.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:11.899 --> 02:14.967
I can't believe you!
To think that we're in a place

02:15.069 --> 02:17.369
that you need to take me
to a shrink!

02:19.406 --> 02:21.306
What are you doing?

02:21.408 --> 02:24.076
We're still
talking here, Harvey!

02:24.178 --> 02:27.079
I just need a few minutes, OK?

02:27.181 --> 02:29.781
It is just like you
to avoid this.

02:29.884 --> 02:32.751
I'm not avoiding anything;
I just need a few minutes.

02:32.853 --> 02:35.287
I'm gonna fix the lights
that you keep complaining about,

02:35.389 --> 02:37.422
and that will give you time
to just calm down.

02:47.735 --> 02:51.470
Are you sure about
this HPD diagnosis?

02:51.572 --> 02:54.373
Well, look
what happened today:

02:54.475 --> 02:56.942
erratic behaviour, unwillingness
to accept criticism,

02:57.044 --> 02:59.011
low tolerance
of frustration.

02:59.113 --> 03:01.947
And then look at what happened
at the party. Rash decisions,

03:02.049 --> 03:04.449
overly dramatic
and emotional

03:04.552 --> 03:06.952
and need to be
the centre of attention.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.054
Yes, it's HPD.

03:11.225 --> 03:14.159
I will try and get her back in
for another appointment.

03:14.261 --> 03:16.862
And if it's not with me,
it needs to be with someone.

03:16.964 --> 03:19.164
These are only
gonna get worse.

03:19.266 --> 03:21.400
More symptoms,
more extreme behaviour.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.702
She could start
to act out sexually,

03:23.804 --> 03:26.838
becoming obsessed
with a relationship

03:26.941 --> 03:29.041
that she believes to be intimate
when it's not,

03:29.143 --> 03:31.009
using somatic illness

03:31.111 --> 03:33.045
or a trauma
to garner attention.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.149
In short, your wife needs help.

04:31.205 --> 04:33.639
Now, you can keep your sanity.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.749
- Welcome!
- Thanks!

05:17.851 --> 05:20.419
- I'm Erin.
- Grace. Grace Fisher.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.622
- I live just over there in that red, brick house.
- Cute!

05:23.724 --> 05:25.624
Umm, I've heard
this neighbourhood is amazing.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.937
I did a bunch of research.
Yeah, the best neighbourhood.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.873
Where did you move in from?
Mount Vernon, Ohio.

05:29.897 --> 05:33.832
Yeah, I saw this place online.
It's completely furnished,

05:33.934 --> 05:36.301
but the owner doesn't have
the best taste, so...

05:36.403 --> 05:38.704
Thank God it's a fresh start.
I'm looking forward

05:38.806 --> 05:40.972
to buying some new furniture.
Fresh start?

05:41.075 --> 05:42.441
- Yes.
- It's very exciting.

05:42.543 --> 05:45.210
Yeah. It was time for me,
experience different things,

05:45.312 --> 05:47.646
meet new people.
Well, I can help with that.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.988
We're having a gathering
at our place Saturday afternoon.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.017
You should stop by.
Really?

05:52.119 --> 05:55.487
Yeah. There will be a ton of neighbours
there, and you can give them a proper hello.

05:55.589 --> 05:58.657
I would love that. It'd be
my first big-city party.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.826
- Well, I'll see you there.
- Yes! Thank you!

06:00.928 --> 06:02.527
Bye!
Bye!

06:05.265 --> 06:07.132
- This is good?
- Yes.

06:25.519 --> 06:28.754
Got it! Here.

06:28.856 --> 06:31.189
Crap! These are
the absolute worst.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.858
- Here.
- No, no,

06:32.960 --> 06:35.105
you don't have to do that.
No, I got more than enough.

06:35.129 --> 06:37.696
Hahaha!
Thank you.

06:37.798 --> 06:40.832
- Don't mention it.
- I'm Grace.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.268
Robert Harris.
Nice to meet you.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.303
Get the groceries home safely.

06:45.406 --> 06:48.407
- I will now thanks to you.
- OK.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.335
- Grace?
- Yes.

07:50.437 --> 07:51.803
- Tina.
- Hi.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.772
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you!

07:53.874 --> 07:56.608
- H.R. asked me to help you get set up.
- Great!

07:56.710 --> 07:58.677
We'll be working
next to each other.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.481
And since it's your first day,
I hope

08:02.583 --> 08:05.183
you'll let me take you to lunch?
That sounds lovely.

08:11.558 --> 08:14.526
So, do you have any plans
this weekend? I know

08:14.628 --> 08:17.496
you just moved here,
so if you want a P.I.C.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.498
to see any of the sights,
let me know.

08:19.600 --> 08:23.702
Thank you. That's very sweet. But
actually, I met one of my neighbours.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.271
She's awesome!
And she invited me

08:26.373 --> 08:28.192
to this block party.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.308
And I have a mountain
of unpacked boxes.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.878
- Yeah.
- And if that's not enough,

08:32.980 --> 08:34.613
for my first weekend,

08:34.715 --> 08:36.615
I am keeping
my fingers crossed

08:36.717 --> 08:38.695
that I'll get to meet up
with an old friend for coffee.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.284
A man?

08:40.386 --> 08:42.320
Yes.

08:42.422 --> 08:45.123
We reconnected
when I found out he lived here.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.125
He's a professor
at Horton.

08:47.227 --> 08:50.228
And an author. Have you heard
of Robert Harris?

08:50.330 --> 08:52.330
- No.
- That's OK.

08:52.432 --> 08:54.299
Um, not everybody has.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.301
His books tend to be
more academic.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.737
Is he single?

08:58.839 --> 09:00.839
Well, I don't know.

09:00.941 --> 09:03.208
Umm, it's been years.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.210
I'm hoping to find out.

09:05.312 --> 09:08.813
I love it. You'll have
to tell me everything on Monday.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.483
I won't leave out
a single dirty detail.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.412
- Hey, you made it!
- Yeah!

09:40.514 --> 09:42.333
- That dress is amazing!
- Do you like it?

09:42.382 --> 09:45.183
- I love it. It's beautiful.
- You don't think it's too much?

09:45.285 --> 09:47.852
No, not at all. You'll be the
hit of the party. Come on in.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.488
Wow! I want to introduce you

09:50.591 --> 09:53.625
to my boyfriend, Robert. Robert!

09:53.727 --> 09:56.761
This is Grace.
She's our new neighbour.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.997
- Hey.
- She's in Bruce's old place.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.033
- Right on. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you! Ha!

10:02.135 --> 10:04.002
- And she brought us this.
- My!

10:04.104 --> 10:07.973
- Yeah.
- That's a... that's a 2007 Bordeaux.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.675
- You know it?
- I've heard of it, yeah, but

10:10.777 --> 10:13.979
I've never had it. Thank you.
Of course.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.717
No, I work at a law firm
in downtown.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.653
- So you're lawyer?
- No. A transcriber.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.688
- Cool!
- Erin!

10:23.790 --> 10:25.609
- I'll be right back!
- Can you hide that,

10:25.659 --> 10:28.893
put it somewhere safe?
Yeah, I can do that.

10:30.564 --> 10:32.464
The market.

10:32.566 --> 10:34.466
The market where I met you
and your groceries.

10:34.568 --> 10:37.002
Outside the market. I was hoping
you didn't remember that.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.004
That was quite embarrassing.
Nonsense.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.973
Let me get you a drink. What
are you having? Wine.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.894
- Red? White?
- Red.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.555
OK. Wayne.
Wayne, I want you

10:57.658 --> 10:59.824
to meet the new kid
on the block. This is Grace.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.660
- H-hi.
- Hi!

11:01.762 --> 11:03.995
Wayne here
is our number one resource

11:04.097 --> 11:06.164
in neighbourhood protection.
You a cop?

11:06.266 --> 11:08.833
No. I've never had
that distinction.

11:08.935 --> 11:11.036
Just a bored,

11:11.138 --> 11:14.239
old insurance investigator
with too much time on his hands.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.508
Well, I already
feel safer.

11:16.610 --> 11:20.245
Now, we live in
a reasonably quiet neighbourhood

11:20.347 --> 11:23.581
and, I don't mean
to alarm you here, but,

11:23.684 --> 11:25.950
just the other day,
I found this guy

11:26.053 --> 11:27.952
stalking around
a vacant lot over

11:28.055 --> 11:31.589
on Quail Road. Looks like
he was trying to squat.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.192
So you be careful?

11:34.294 --> 11:36.194
Be aware of your surroundings.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.962
Always.
Wayne, I get worried

11:38.065 --> 11:39.798
when you start confronting these
guys. I mean, I hope you're not

11:39.900 --> 11:41.633
putting yourself in risk
when you're dealing with 'em.

11:41.735 --> 11:45.070
Baah. - : Well, if you
ever need any help, let me know.

11:45.172 --> 11:48.039
- Well, I appreciate it, Robert.
- Alright.

11:48.141 --> 11:51.376
- Robert!
- Excuse me.

11:51.478 --> 11:54.913
So...
are you married?

11:55.015 --> 11:56.948
No. Single

11:57.050 --> 11:58.950
and in the big city.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.290
My gosh!

12:05.392 --> 12:09.127
I am such a klutz!
Your dress!

12:09.229 --> 12:11.396
Ummm......

12:11.498 --> 12:13.431
OK, come on. Come on.
OK.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.767
I know Erin has something

12:15.869 --> 12:18.136
for just this type
of situation.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.438
You know, it's been driving
me crazy since I met you,

12:20.540 --> 12:22.941
that I knew you from somewhere,
and then I heard that you're

12:23.043 --> 12:25.443
an author.
I am. Where the hell is that?

12:25.545 --> 12:26.978
You're <i> the</i> Robert Harris.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.481
<i>The 60s: The Pop Culture
Revolution?</i> I've read your book.

12:29.583 --> 12:33.318
- Come on! Really? You like it?
- Yes! Yes! I adored it.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.398
I'd love to talk about it,
but I want to make sure

12:35.422 --> 12:37.155
I haven't ruined your dress.
No, you didn't. It's fine!

12:37.257 --> 12:39.791
Erin will know where the stain
remover is. Give me a second.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.096
I'm just relieved
it came out.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.098
Me too.
Thank you guys

12:47.200 --> 12:48.867
so much for letting me
in your beautiful home.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.369
I had the best time.
Glad to hear.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.538
Haha!
Well, we should do lunch.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.775
Definitely. I'm
on the road starting Tuesday,

12:56.877 --> 12:58.777
but when I'm back,
we'll set something up.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.312
- Perfect! OK.
- Right. Hey, it's a pleasure

13:01.414 --> 13:04.182
to meet you. Pleasure to meet you too.
Bye, guys!

13:04.284 --> 13:07.619
- See you.
- Get home safe.

13:07.721 --> 13:10.088
Liked her.
I know.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.795
So, tell me. Did you meet
your friend for the coffee date?

13:16.897 --> 13:20.632
It wasn't a date.
Not at first.

13:20.734 --> 13:21.966
O.M.G.! Tell me.

13:22.068 --> 13:24.035
A lady never
sleeps and tells.

13:24.137 --> 13:27.205
- Shut up! You didn't?
- I didn't.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.374
But was the magic
still there?

13:29.476 --> 13:33.111
It was just like old times,
like that teenage love of the past.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.547
But there are
some grown-up hurdles.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.882
He's not married, is he?

13:37.984 --> 13:40.385
- No, no, no.
- Trust me,

13:40.487 --> 13:42.487
never get involved
with a married man.

13:42.589 --> 13:46.124
He's just getting out of a heavy relationship
and doesn't want to rush into anything.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.860
And neither should you.
You need to be careful.

13:48.962 --> 13:52.130
Don't worry,
I know what I'm doing.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.279
<i>"Stalked over 6 months."</i>

14:11.117 --> 14:12.984
<i> Just the other day,</i>

14:13.086 --> 14:15.520
<i>I found this guy
stalking around a vacant lot</i>

14:15.622 --> 14:17.555
<i>over on Quail Road.</i>

14:17.657 --> 14:20.291
<i>Well, if you ever
need any help, let me know.</i>

14:42.215 --> 14:44.315
Bye.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.629
Help!

14:57.731 --> 15:00.231
Help! Help!

15:00.333 --> 15:01.966
Robert!

15:02.068 --> 15:03.887
Grace? What's wrong?

15:03.970 --> 15:06.170
- There's someone in the house!
- What?!

15:06.273 --> 15:09.707
Who? I don't know!
He ran out the back!

15:09.809 --> 15:11.709
- Are you hurt? Did he hurt you?
- No!

15:11.811 --> 15:13.678
No.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.681
OK. Come on, let's get in
the house. We'll call the cops.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.161
<i>Now tell me, why do you think
you have a stalker?</i>

15:23.189 --> 15:25.008
Have you
seen him before?

15:25.091 --> 15:28.192
No. I, just...

15:28.295 --> 15:30.428
The last couple days,
I just haven't felt alone.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.931
Did you get a good look to be
able to give a description?

15:34.634 --> 15:36.501
White.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.770
Tall

15:38.872 --> 15:40.738
and slim built.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.341
Any facial hair? Hair color?

15:46.279 --> 15:48.212
I-I-I couldn't tell.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.915
I mean, he slipped away
too fast.

15:51.017 --> 15:53.584
We have a neighbour;
he's a retired

15:53.687 --> 15:55.586
insurance investigator
named Wayne McNeely.

15:55.689 --> 15:57.722
- Wayne. I know Wayne.
- OK, then

15:57.824 --> 16:00.336
I think maybe you should talk to him. He
might be able to help you find this guy.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.560
He was telling us
about how he ran

16:02.662 --> 16:05.163
someone off last week.
I'll check in with him.

16:13.707 --> 16:15.640
It's all clear, ma'am.
We have your statement,

16:15.742 --> 16:18.042
and we can walk you
back over if you like.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.856
- Wait, that's it?
- That's all for now. There's not really much to go on.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.548
No forced entry,
no broken windows,

16:23.650 --> 16:25.730
no evidence of any kind
that there was someone there.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.219
Just a shadow.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.221
It was more
than just a shadow.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.725
Any tips or suggestions
of what she can do to stay safe

16:33.827 --> 16:36.227
until you find this guy?

16:36.329 --> 16:38.396
For now, Ms. Fisher,
change your locks,

16:38.498 --> 16:41.232
get an alarm system,
maybe buy a dog;

16:41.334 --> 16:44.235
but most importantly,
be vigilant about being alone

16:44.337 --> 16:46.838
in the street.
OK.

16:46.940 --> 16:50.274
Now if you're ready,
we can take you back over.

16:50.377 --> 16:53.711
That's OK, guys. I'll
make sure she gets home safe.

16:53.813 --> 16:56.581
Thanks. Thanks for your help.
Thank you.

17:01.221 --> 17:04.355
So does
Erin travel a lot for work?

17:04.457 --> 17:08.925
Yeah, yeah. She's in charge of
the Northeast corridor, so...

17:09.029 --> 17:11.963
- What is her job exactly?
- She's a rep for Mensoto.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.964
It's a biotech
manufacturer.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.967
Yeah, you probably have
never heard of it.

17:16.069 --> 17:19.604
Sorry.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.705
So that must make
your relationship hard,

17:21.808 --> 17:23.627
the travelling.

17:23.675 --> 17:26.911
I mean, it's...
It doesn't help, but I mean,

17:27.012 --> 17:29.313
it is what it is.
You, you love somebody,

17:29.416 --> 17:32.083
you do whatever it takes to be
with that person, right?

17:32.185 --> 17:34.585
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Yeah. So, is it

17:34.687 --> 17:37.688
the bright lights, big city
that drew you to us?

17:39.893 --> 17:42.093
You know,
I just needed a change

17:42.195 --> 17:44.495
after my husband
passed away.

17:44.597 --> 17:48.332
God, Grace,
I... I had no idea.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.835
Yeah, we were
high-school sweethearts.

17:50.937 --> 17:52.804
Man.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.573
I can understand why
you'd want some change.

17:58.178 --> 18:02.180
I... Do you mind
if I ask how he passed?

18:02.282 --> 18:04.615
- Brain tumour.
- Wow.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.351
It was a long,
tough battle, but,

18:07.454 --> 18:09.520
in the end,
he was at peace.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.491
They make good drinks.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.827
Yes, they do.
I think I had too many.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.930
Thank you for tonight.
It was my pleasure.

18:19.032 --> 18:21.999
- I have one last request though.
- OK, shoot.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.102
Would you mind
checking the rooms in my house?

18:24.204 --> 18:25.937
Yeah, sure.

18:26.039 --> 18:27.905
OK.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.400
Hello.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.918
It's right here.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.348
I mean,
everything looks fine.

19:10.450 --> 19:13.918
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Don't mention it.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.354
Have a good night.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.389
You too. Ha!

19:33.506 --> 19:35.640
Robert!
Grace!

20:07.807 --> 20:10.241
You're mine, Robert.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.843
That's unbelievable!

20:12.946 --> 20:15.813
I always chalked it up
to Wayne being overly paranoid,

20:15.915 --> 20:17.748
but a stalker?!
Yeah.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.351
Wow! Is she doing OK?

20:20.453 --> 20:22.353
Well...

20:22.455 --> 20:24.274
she seems OK,
but who knows,

20:24.324 --> 20:26.143
right?

20:26.192 --> 20:28.192
So, hey, I know
you just got in,

20:28.294 --> 20:30.113
but we have Wayne's
for dinner tonight.

20:32.165 --> 20:34.832
That's right.

20:34.934 --> 20:37.335
Here you go.

20:37.437 --> 20:40.371
- Thanks.
- Speaking of dinner,

20:40.473 --> 20:42.406
tell me about last night.

20:44.344 --> 20:47.511
It's that serious? No.
Amanda's leaving the company.

20:47.614 --> 20:50.214
- Where's she going?
- Some start-up wooed her away.

20:50.316 --> 20:54.085
That's tough. She was
always a big ally for you.

20:54.187 --> 20:56.854
She still is,
even on her way out.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.357
And she's involved
in hiring her replacement

20:59.459 --> 21:01.425
and she's convinced corporate
to consider me

21:01.527 --> 21:03.561
for the position.
Replacing Amanda at corporate?

21:03.663 --> 21:06.097
That's big! Wow!

21:06.199 --> 21:08.532
There will be
a vetting process,

21:08.635 --> 21:10.701
and it'd mean
major changes.

21:10.803 --> 21:14.572
- Like moving to Baltimore?
- Like moving to Baltimore. - OK.

21:18.845 --> 21:21.912
Well, I mean...

21:22.015 --> 21:24.248
I could write anywhere.

21:24.350 --> 21:26.484
I could teach.

21:26.586 --> 21:29.420
Just have to figure out
my tenure.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.555
I know... I know
it's a lot for you

21:31.658 --> 21:34.058
to have to give up
to make this happen.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.295
But I wouldn't be
travelling near as much

21:37.397 --> 21:39.630
and it's a substantial
pay increase.

21:42.168 --> 21:44.179
Just always thought this is
gonna be our forever home.

21:44.203 --> 21:46.937
I know. I did too.

21:47.040 --> 21:50.074
We don't have
to make a decision today,

21:50.176 --> 21:52.443
but Amanda's
giving them a month,

21:52.545 --> 21:55.146
and they'd like to have someone
in place before she leaves.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.684
We'll figure this out.

22:01.587 --> 22:03.454
Yes, we will.

22:06.192 --> 22:08.292
OK. I think
that's it!

22:08.394 --> 22:10.995
Thank you.
It's nothing.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.664
For dinner tonight,
there's a little bit of prep.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.666
Will you be home
around 4?

22:15.768 --> 22:17.780
I should be home. But if
I'm not back from my errands,

22:17.804 --> 22:19.704
there's a spare key
under the flower pot

22:19.806 --> 22:21.772
by the backdoor.
Perfect.

22:21.874 --> 22:24.975
Thank you so much, Wayne.
Hey, no problem.

22:25.078 --> 22:26.644
Anytime.

22:26.746 --> 22:29.246
- Bye.
- Bye.

22:39.092 --> 22:40.691
- Hey, hello there!
- Hi!

22:40.793 --> 22:42.727
- Come on in!
- Thanks for having us over!

22:42.829 --> 22:44.729
- Hahaha!
- Smells so great!

22:44.831 --> 22:46.731
- Good to see you.
- That's for you.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.733
Yeah, what are you
cooking up, Wayne?

22:48.835 --> 22:50.875
Well, I hope you don't mind;
I solicited some help

22:50.937 --> 22:53.637
putting dinner together.
Hi, you two!

22:53.740 --> 22:57.375
- Hi!
- Happy to see you!

22:57.477 --> 22:59.844
Hi.
They were wondering

22:59.946 --> 23:03.347
what's on the menu.
So it's chicken cacciatore.

23:03.449 --> 23:05.649
I've never done it before,
so I'm just praying to

23:05.752 --> 23:08.130
the kitchen gods that it's not
a complete and utter disaster.

23:08.154 --> 23:10.821
No, it'll be fantastic.
Here, you take that in,

23:10.923 --> 23:12.757
and you go on in.
I'll take your coats.

23:12.859 --> 23:15.426
- Alright.
- Thanks.

23:15.528 --> 23:17.428
So yeah, I spent
the day with Grace

23:17.530 --> 23:19.430
getting her set up
like Fort Knox.

23:19.532 --> 23:22.177
I don't know what I would have done
without him. I'm gonna go grab dessert.

23:22.201 --> 23:23.734
- Yeah.
- Yum-yum.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.771
So, Erin, what's new
with you? How's the job?

23:37.049 --> 23:40.618
Well, you know how fond
I am of being subtle.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.753
It's...

23:42.855 --> 23:44.722
it's gonna be hard for me
to see you go.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.190
What's this?

23:46.292 --> 23:49.026
Well, it appears
Erin here has

23:49.128 --> 23:51.095
a job opportunity
in Baltimore.

23:51.197 --> 23:54.899
No! I mean,
that's wonderful for you,

23:55.001 --> 23:56.934
but I'm gonna miss you.

23:57.036 --> 23:59.203
I mean, we were just getting
to know each other.

23:59.305 --> 24:01.405
Thank you. That's sweet.

24:01.507 --> 24:03.040
And I'm sure
long-distance

24:03.142 --> 24:05.154
relationships aren't difficult
these days with, you know,

24:05.178 --> 24:08.245
technology being able to connect to you.
Well, I mean,

24:08.347 --> 24:11.615
it's not... it's not
set in stone yet. But I mean,

24:11.717 --> 24:13.651
if it does happen,
then we'll be moving together.

24:13.753 --> 24:17.555
And it's the... it's the most
plausible option, right?

24:17.657 --> 24:20.324
Yeah.

24:20.426 --> 24:22.660
It's already getting crazy.
I mean, I'm back

24:22.762 --> 24:24.595
on the road
for a few days.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.498
Dammit, Grace,
keep it together.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.500
Keep it together.

24:29.602 --> 24:32.069
He'll stay; she'll leave.
He'll stay.

24:32.171 --> 24:34.071
Stay.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.941
I appreciate
you guys walking me home.

24:37.043 --> 24:40.444
God, it's the least we could
do after that wonderful meal.

24:40.546 --> 24:42.446
- I'm glad you guys liked it.
- Yeah.

24:42.548 --> 24:44.482
Well, we want to make sure
you got home safe.

24:44.584 --> 24:47.351
Thank you.
Have a good night.

24:47.453 --> 24:49.320
Good night!

24:49.422 --> 24:51.722
- You got your keys?
- Yep.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.193
OK. Good night.

25:12.812 --> 25:15.546
Have a seat.

25:20.520 --> 25:23.087
Well, that was a fun night.
Yes, it was.

25:45.077 --> 25:46.977
Morning, girl.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.679
Grace?

25:48.781 --> 25:50.748
- You're late!
- Sorry.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.850
I didn't have time
to go home after my date.

25:52.952 --> 25:55.719
It's going that well?

25:55.821 --> 25:58.188
Yeah, except he might be
leaving town.

25:58.291 --> 26:01.492
No! That's no good when you
guys are finally reconnecting.

26:01.594 --> 26:05.329
Yeah, well, desperate times
call for desperate measures.

26:05.431 --> 26:08.232
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm not quite sure yet.

26:08.334 --> 26:11.168
Maybe you can convince him
to stay?

26:11.270 --> 26:12.937
Maybe.

26:13.039 --> 26:15.973
- Lunch?
- I'm sorry, I can't.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.275
I gotta be somewhere.

26:25.551 --> 26:27.284
<i>Who can, </i>

26:27.386 --> 26:30.098
who can tell me something else that
would have been happening around '68?

26:30.122 --> 26:33.557
Anyone? No? Probably the birth
of half your parents.

26:33.659 --> 26:35.593
Yeah?
They were protesting

26:35.695 --> 26:37.795
Vietnam War.
That's right.

26:40.967 --> 26:43.801
<i> That's not fair.</i>

26:43.903 --> 26:45.869
This is not right.

26:45.972 --> 26:48.872
For him, for her,

26:48.975 --> 26:51.008
or for us.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.745
Haha!

26:54.847 --> 26:56.213
Bye.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.882
Bye.

27:42.595 --> 27:45.696
Argh!!

27:50.036 --> 27:52.136
Help! HELP ME!

27:52.238 --> 27:53.771
Help! HELP!

27:53.873 --> 27:56.674
Help me! Help me! Help me!

27:58.744 --> 28:00.944
Hello?

28:01.047 --> 28:02.946
- Woman:
- Yep, this is him.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.551
Wait, what, what? Sorry?

28:07.653 --> 28:09.631
Wait a sec. What's this about?

28:12.658 --> 28:14.258
When?

28:14.360 --> 28:16.026
Is she there now?

28:24.503 --> 28:27.905
- Hey.
- Hey. How are you?

28:28.007 --> 28:29.406
Are you out?

28:29.508 --> 28:31.975
Someone attacked her, Erin.
Attacked what?

28:32.078 --> 28:34.278
Grace. Outside the Gastro.
They think it may have been

28:34.346 --> 28:37.114
My God! Is she OK?

28:37.216 --> 28:39.416
I don't know.
I'm just getting here.

28:39.518 --> 28:42.731
If they release her tonight, you might want to
offer to stay at our place in the guestroom.

28:42.755 --> 28:45.489
It's a good idea.
It's late, are you OK?

28:45.591 --> 28:47.791
Yeah, I'm good.

28:47.893 --> 28:49.793
Everything's fine.
You deal with that;

28:49.895 --> 28:51.795
we'll talk later. Love you!

28:51.897 --> 28:54.665
I love you.

28:54.767 --> 28:58.268
Dr.
Langley to the ER. Dr. Langley.

28:58.370 --> 29:00.330
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking

29:00.372 --> 29:03.107
for my friend Grace.
She was admitted earlier.

29:03.209 --> 29:04.842
- Robert?
- Grace?

29:04.944 --> 29:07.511
My God! Are you OK?
Are you OK? What...?

29:07.613 --> 29:09.513
- I just...
- What happened?

29:09.615 --> 29:12.683
It happened so fast.
I mean, he just grabbed me

29:12.785 --> 29:15.018
from behind and his mouth
was whispering to my ear,

29:15.121 --> 29:17.955
and he was upset because
I was talking with another man.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.791
And then he just...
he wouldn't let me go,

29:20.893 --> 29:23.794
and he... he said
he was gonna do things to me.

29:23.896 --> 29:25.796
And then I somehow broke free.

29:25.898 --> 29:28.732
God, you got away.

29:28.834 --> 29:30.801
Did you tell the police
all about it?

29:30.903 --> 29:32.781
- Yeah, they just left.
- And what did they say?

29:32.805 --> 29:35.305
That they would do
their best to find him.

29:35.407 --> 29:37.226
<i>Code Blue 15-0-1.</i>

29:37.276 --> 29:39.476
<i>All doctors on the first floor,
please be warned...</i>

29:39.578 --> 29:41.979
Erin suggested
you stay with us tonight.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.515
So why don't we
get you out of here.

29:44.617 --> 29:47.251
OK?

29:49.255 --> 29:51.522
- What is it?
- Nothing.

29:51.624 --> 29:54.258
- No, tell me.
- I just...

29:57.163 --> 29:59.196
I don't know, I don't want
you guys to leave.

30:03.269 --> 30:06.670
You and Erin, you just...

30:06.772 --> 30:08.705
you've made me feel

30:08.808 --> 30:11.708
like I'm not alone.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.710
Grace, you're not alone.

30:13.813 --> 30:16.013
You're not alone.

30:16.115 --> 30:19.315
Wayne is just a couple of doors down from
you, and he's - : Wayne.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.086
I do have Wayne.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.891
But Wayne is not you.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.998
We'll tell the other
neighbours about your situation.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.267
So you are leaving?

30:39.805 --> 30:41.672
Yeah, I-I think so.

30:46.645 --> 30:48.812
OK.

30:48.914 --> 30:51.582
So, you know,
just let me know

30:51.684 --> 30:53.650
what you need
if you need anything.

30:53.752 --> 30:55.652
There's...

30:55.754 --> 30:57.654
Yeah, some old t-shirts

30:57.756 --> 30:59.656
if you wanna get changed.

30:59.758 --> 31:02.993
And here's a towel

31:03.095 --> 31:06.296
if you want
to get washed up.

31:06.398 --> 31:08.398
My God.

31:15.507 --> 31:17.908
You're OK.

31:18.010 --> 31:20.010
Good night.
Good night.

31:39.098 --> 31:41.565
You're not going
anywhere, Robert.

31:51.043 --> 31:54.278
<i> How are you doing?</i>

31:54.380 --> 31:57.047
- I'm OK. Better.
- God!

31:59.785 --> 32:02.286
I'm just relieved
it wasn't any worse.

32:02.388 --> 32:04.554
Any news
on finding this guy?

32:04.657 --> 32:06.657
No. No.

32:06.759 --> 32:08.578
They'll find him.
They have to.

32:08.661 --> 32:10.394
I know they will.
Thanks.

32:10.496 --> 32:12.396
Robert made

32:12.498 --> 32:14.898
the most amazing
French toast.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.878
You know what, actually,
let me serve you some.

32:16.902 --> 32:18.769
- No, sit!
- Yes, yes. It's the least

32:18.871 --> 32:20.804
I could do. You two, sit.

32:23.742 --> 32:26.009
Thank you.

32:26.111 --> 32:28.412
So, what happened?

32:28.514 --> 32:30.514
Well,

32:30.616 --> 32:33.250
they're still making a decision,
but it's pretty much mine

32:33.352 --> 32:35.652
to lose. I have to go to the
Wincott office this afternoon

32:35.754 --> 32:38.388
and start a new project though.
That's quick.

32:38.490 --> 32:41.892
I know. It's gonna be a long
night. And I think it's gonna be

32:41.994 --> 32:44.561
an even longer month.
Burning the midnight oil,

32:44.663 --> 32:46.563
pulling in
16-hour days.

32:46.665 --> 32:48.565
Sounds fun, right?

32:48.667 --> 32:50.667
It will be worth it.

32:50.769 --> 32:54.104
We're in it together,
and I'm there for you.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.687
There's so much to do,
so much to do.

34:26.431 --> 34:30.500
Argh!!

34:33.172 --> 34:36.005
Grace?
You can't have him!

34:44.516 --> 34:46.516
It didn't have to come to this.

35:23.989 --> 35:26.156
It's for the best.

35:56.755 --> 35:58.755
<i>If I may,
what is the occasion?</i>

35:58.857 --> 36:02.559
Just a small gathering
of friends and family.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.628
For anything special?

36:06.331 --> 36:08.465
My engagement party.

36:19.077 --> 36:22.078
I don't know.
I don't think it'll help.

36:22.181 --> 36:25.215
Robert, even if it's not much,
you should try

36:25.317 --> 36:27.250
eating something.
Thanks.

36:30.455 --> 36:33.156
Look, man, we're going.
It will be good for you.

36:33.258 --> 36:35.258
It's just so much to do.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.361
It's only
a couple of days.

36:38.463 --> 36:40.697
What's this?
Where are you going?

36:40.799 --> 36:42.999
Tomorrow,
I'm taking Robert

36:43.101 --> 36:45.268
to my family's cabin
for a few days.

36:54.479 --> 36:56.346
Any news
on the investigation?

36:56.448 --> 37:00.417
No. Ahem! No, they haven't
told me anything.

37:08.427 --> 37:10.327
Calm down, Grace.

37:10.429 --> 37:12.896
It's just a few days.

37:12.998 --> 37:16.233
He'll be back. Just...

37:16.335 --> 37:18.235
keep it together.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.237
He needs to wash away.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.307
Let him wash away.

37:33.986 --> 37:37.420
Where's Robert? He went to
close his eyes for a bit.

37:37.522 --> 37:40.924
- He went to sleep?!
- Maybe at this point, yeah.

37:41.026 --> 37:43.493
I mean, it's,
it's been a long day.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.414
For everybody.

37:47.366 --> 37:49.199
I know.

37:49.301 --> 37:52.302
I just, ummm...
I wanted to say good night.

37:52.404 --> 37:54.237
Yeah, I'll let him know.

38:04.449 --> 38:07.550
- Hello?
- Hey. I didn't get a chance

38:07.653 --> 38:10.053
to tell you this in person, but
I just want to say thank you.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.859
And,

38:15.961 --> 38:17.861
I couldn't have gone through it
without you, so

38:22.567 --> 38:25.468
You're welcome.

38:25.570 --> 38:27.804
If you need anything else,
just let me know.

38:27.906 --> 38:30.540
You've done enough already.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.475
I just thought,

38:32.577 --> 38:35.312
you're gonna be away
during trash day; I could take

38:35.414 --> 38:37.414
your bins to the curb.

38:37.516 --> 38:40.817
You don't have to,
but if you do, there's a key

38:40.919 --> 38:42.986
in the back
under one of those fake rocks.

38:45.057 --> 38:47.190
I'll take care of it. Bye.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.597
Excuse me.

39:27.699 --> 39:31.134
What are you leaving there?
Just some food.

39:31.236 --> 39:34.104
Who sent you?

39:34.206 --> 39:36.106
No one made...
I did it on my own.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.408
I work with Grace.

39:38.510 --> 39:41.878
She's been missing work on and
off for the last week or two.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.148
It's the flu, I think,
and I know

39:45.250 --> 39:47.317
how tough that can be,
especially when you're new

39:47.419 --> 39:49.238
to the city.
But she's not answering,

39:49.287 --> 39:52.789
so I guess she started
to feel better and she got out.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.710
Sorry to prod. It's just

39:54.793 --> 39:56.993
we've had some trouble
in the neighbourhood as of late.

39:57.095 --> 39:59.829
No offence taken.

39:59.931 --> 40:02.098
Have a nice day.
You too.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.753
Ha!

42:16.201 --> 42:18.101
Thanks, Bruce.

42:18.203 --> 42:20.703
And, good luck
with those tests.

42:20.805 --> 42:23.773
Yeah. I'll see you soon.

42:51.202 --> 42:53.102
<i>Will you please
pick up?</i>

42:53.204 --> 42:56.706
Good. Good, good, good.

43:36.381 --> 43:38.915
Hey.
Hey there.

43:39.017 --> 43:41.250
Well, I'm happy to see
you made it back safe.

43:41.353 --> 43:44.120
Yeah. Yeah.
Alright, this is

43:44.222 --> 43:46.289
for you.
It's no Bordeaux;

43:46.391 --> 43:48.358
it's just from the area
that Nathan and I were.

43:48.460 --> 43:51.260
Hoho! That's nice of you.
You shouldn't have.

43:51.363 --> 43:54.497
Tt's the least I could do for
everything you've done for me.

43:56.434 --> 43:58.868
How are you? You OK?

44:02.440 --> 44:04.259
What is it?

44:06.444 --> 44:08.578
Let me show you something.

44:18.390 --> 44:20.723
What the hell is this, Grace?
Are these from him?

44:20.825 --> 44:23.993
Yeah.

44:24.095 --> 44:26.796
Have you told
the detectives?

44:26.898 --> 44:29.298
I just sent over a release,

44:29.401 --> 44:31.321
but they can't do anything
until it goes through.

44:35.340 --> 44:37.573
When did he leave these?

44:39.511 --> 44:41.711
Last night. Late.

44:41.813 --> 44:44.914
Can you, can you play 'em?
I wanna hear 'em.

44:51.089 --> 44:53.022
<i>Will you please
pick up?</i>

44:53.124 --> 44:56.426
<i>I just wanna hear your voice.</i>

44:56.528 --> 44:59.495
<i>That night at the pub
was nothing</i>

44:59.597 --> 45:02.265
<i>if you continue to ignore me.</i>

45:06.504 --> 45:08.323
All of these?

45:09.841 --> 45:12.975
They get worse?
Yeah.

45:16.514 --> 45:18.748
How long does this
have to go on?

45:21.453 --> 45:24.532
I'm not accepting this. We're not accepting
this! What are they gonna have us do?

45:24.556 --> 45:26.255
Just wait around
while this guy terrorizes you?!

45:26.357 --> 45:29.292
And the cops do nothing?!
Robert, calm down.

45:33.331 --> 45:36.099
I think I have an idea
how we can find this guy.

45:42.207 --> 45:45.141
There you go.

45:46.978 --> 45:48.878
I know exactly where this is.

45:48.980 --> 45:51.280
Let's go.

45:54.486 --> 45:57.286
OK, this is the place.

45:59.357 --> 46:01.224
I never asked you;

46:01.326 --> 46:03.426
how was the cabin?

46:03.528 --> 46:05.394
Honestly?

46:05.497 --> 46:07.430
Horrible.

46:07.532 --> 46:10.099
Nothing to do but just sit
up there and think about Erin

46:10.201 --> 46:14.403
and how some... savage
took her away from me.

46:16.741 --> 46:18.641
You know, you could always
take time off work.

46:18.743 --> 46:20.743
No, it's good to be back.

46:20.845 --> 46:23.679
Got work. Got the book. Got this
book-signing thing tomorrow.

46:23.782 --> 46:25.748
I thought about cancelling.

46:25.850 --> 46:28.184
Well, if you want to,
then you should.

46:28.286 --> 46:30.453
No.

46:30.555 --> 46:32.755
If I cancel, then it'd just be
that much easier

46:32.857 --> 46:35.224
to say no
or cancel the next thing.

46:37.829 --> 46:40.763
I'm gonna go and check him out.
Be careful.

47:18.436 --> 47:20.336
Were you working
here last night?

47:20.438 --> 47:22.305
What of it?

47:28.179 --> 47:31.514
Did you let anyone
use that phone?

47:31.616 --> 47:33.282
No, man, that would
cost me my job.

47:33.384 --> 47:36.052
Right. Sure.
Sure wouldn't know.

47:38.089 --> 47:40.523
Is that your name?

47:40.625 --> 47:42.444
Yeah.

47:44.629 --> 47:46.662
What's this about?

47:46.764 --> 47:49.699
Well...

47:49.801 --> 47:52.401
you see that phone was used
to threaten my friend.

47:52.503 --> 47:55.705
And if you didn't let anyone else
use it, then that means it was you.

47:55.807 --> 47:58.307
I... I didn't
use that phone.

48:02.380 --> 48:05.081
We got the messages. My next
stop is the police station.

48:05.183 --> 48:08.317
So once we tie those calls
to her attacker...

48:08.419 --> 48:11.520
- Whoa-whoa! She was attacked?
- That's right.

48:14.559 --> 48:16.626
Yo, I didn't know
about any of that, man.

48:16.728 --> 48:18.694
I-I thought I was just...
You thought what?

48:21.132 --> 48:23.052
Yo, I was trying
to make some quick extra cash.

48:23.134 --> 48:24.734
How?

48:24.836 --> 48:27.236
Somebody paid me to leave

48:27.338 --> 48:29.216
those messages, gave me a number
to call and what to say.

48:29.240 --> 48:31.574
- Who?! Who paid you?!
- Don't know, man. Hooked it up

48:31.676 --> 48:34.911
on anonilyst. No name. And you didn't
think what you were doing was wrong?

48:35.013 --> 48:37.113
People are weird.
They get off

48:37.215 --> 48:40.516
on strange stuff. It was 50 bucks
for 30 messages, man. That was it!

48:42.420 --> 48:44.239
"50 bucks"?

48:54.499 --> 48:57.700
So what did he say?

48:57.802 --> 49:00.503
He claimed somebody paid him
to make the calls.

49:03.341 --> 49:05.241
What do we do now?

49:05.343 --> 49:09.045
Take what we got
and pass it along to the police.

49:09.147 --> 49:11.647
That's it?

49:33.004 --> 49:35.671
It means a lot
to have you there.

49:37.675 --> 49:40.242
I just wanted
to tell you that.

49:43.481 --> 49:45.514
Well, you've been
there for me too.

49:49.587 --> 49:51.865
I was wondering if I could go
to your book signing tomorrow.

49:55.560 --> 49:57.460
it will be pretty boring.

49:57.562 --> 50:01.664
Well, I've never been
to a book signing before,

50:01.766 --> 50:04.133
so I think
it would be

50:04.235 --> 50:07.403
pretty exciting if the first one
I went to, I knew the author.

50:11.943 --> 50:14.043
Yeah. It would be nice

50:14.145 --> 50:16.679
to see a familiar face.

50:16.781 --> 50:18.414
Great!

50:18.516 --> 50:20.349
I'll walk you.

50:24.088 --> 50:26.389
<i>I'm thinking
all this started at her work.</i>

50:26.491 --> 50:28.491
Did you get her to put

50:28.593 --> 50:30.192
an employer down
on her rental agreement?

50:30.294 --> 50:33.696
I did. I got
a copy of it, somewhere.

50:33.798 --> 50:36.098
Yeah.

50:38.903 --> 50:40.870
Since she was coming in
from out of State,

50:40.972 --> 50:42.872
I wanted proof
of employment.

50:42.974 --> 50:45.808
And I spoke to a woman
at the law firm

50:45.910 --> 50:48.911
that hired her too.
But I'm not sure

50:49.013 --> 50:50.679
I needed all that
for her though.

50:50.782 --> 50:53.983
She paid three months
in advance.

50:54.085 --> 50:56.252
Must have had
quite the insurance payout

50:56.354 --> 50:58.854
when her husband died.

50:58.956 --> 51:01.457
Here we go.

51:11.369 --> 51:13.269
- Hi!
- Hi.

51:13.371 --> 51:17.273
Glad to see you back. How did
that last piece work for you?

51:17.375 --> 51:19.108
It was a hit.
Everyone loved it.

51:19.210 --> 51:21.029
And what are you
looking for today?

51:21.079 --> 51:24.747
Something elegant
to impress my man.

51:28.486 --> 51:30.953
<i>Well, she never</i>

51:31.055 --> 51:33.022
told me she had a stalker.

51:33.124 --> 51:34.957
Maybe that's why
she kept calling in sick,

51:35.059 --> 51:36.892
why she quit!

51:36.994 --> 51:38.861
She quit? When was that?

51:38.963 --> 51:41.363
The day after I dropped off
the food.

51:41.466 --> 51:43.899
When I talked to you.

51:44.001 --> 51:45.968
What's she like
around the office?

51:47.738 --> 51:50.072
A little flashy.

51:50.174 --> 51:52.119
A little too eager to show off
what she had, you know?

51:52.143 --> 51:53.962
I can see that.

51:54.011 --> 51:56.612
I wish I could tell you more,
but every time we talked,

51:56.714 --> 51:59.448
it was just chitchat. But have
you talked to her boyfriend yet?

51:59.550 --> 52:01.450
He might be able
to tell you something.

52:01.552 --> 52:03.371
Boyfriend?

52:03.421 --> 52:06.088
No, I didn't know
she had one. Who is he?

52:06.190 --> 52:09.592
Some professor-writer
over at Horton.

52:11.529 --> 52:14.230
You need to tell me everything
she said about this boyfriend.

52:22.106 --> 52:24.006
- Hey!
- Hey.

52:24.108 --> 52:26.075
Thanks for coming.
Of course.

52:28.112 --> 52:29.678
Umm, let me just...

52:29.780 --> 52:31.747
OK. One second.
I can take-

52:31.849 --> 52:33.749
Want me to take that? I got it.
- Right.

52:33.851 --> 52:36.685
- Hahaha! It's a nice crowd.
- Yeah. Yeah, I mean

52:36.787 --> 52:38.787
it's not Beatlemania,
but not bad

52:38.890 --> 52:40.923
for pop-culture
historical-text fans, I guess.

52:41.025 --> 52:42.925
But they'll show.

52:43.027 --> 52:45.027
How about when this is over
we grab a bite?

52:45.129 --> 52:47.196
Yeah, that sounds good.

52:47.298 --> 52:49.331
- OK.
- I think I better get started.

52:49.433 --> 52:51.934
OK.

52:52.036 --> 52:53.035
- Hi.
- Hi.

52:53.137 --> 52:55.271
Johnny.

52:57.375 --> 53:00.776
There you are.
Thanks a lot. Enjoy.

53:02.446 --> 53:04.647
Enjoy it.
Thank you, Dr. Harris.

53:04.749 --> 53:06.649
<i>I wish you didn't
feel it necessary</i>

53:06.751 --> 53:09.885
<i>to lie to me, Grace.
I tried to be your friend!</i>

53:09.987 --> 53:11.887
<i>I wanted to make you
feel welcome,</i>

53:11.989 --> 53:13.989
<i>and I could have been
there for you as you dealt</i>

53:14.091 --> 53:16.659
<i>with that stalker your neighbour
Wayne was telling me about.</i>

53:16.761 --> 53:18.827
<i>But no, you lied to me
about everything,</i>

53:18.930 --> 53:21.163
<i>including that boyfriend.</i>

53:21.265 --> 53:23.432
<i>Have a nice life, Grace.</i>

53:42.253 --> 53:45.087
Enjoy.

53:45.189 --> 53:46.689
Thank you,
Dr. Harris.

53:46.791 --> 53:49.525
- How you do?
- Fine, thanks.

53:49.627 --> 53:51.594
Here you are.
Thanks a lot.

53:58.302 --> 54:01.136
- I loved the book.
- OK.

54:03.107 --> 54:05.741
Yes. Have a great day.

54:05.843 --> 54:07.843
Mathieu.

54:11.616 --> 54:13.435
Enjoy.

54:15.486 --> 54:17.953
Hi there.
Thanks for buying it.

54:18.055 --> 54:20.222
Thank you.

54:20.324 --> 54:23.125
Sorry. Um,
I'm not feeling

54:23.227 --> 54:26.595
very well. I'm gonna actually head home.
OK. Well, get well.

54:26.697 --> 54:29.365
- Thanks. Rain check on dinner?
- Yeah.

54:35.239 --> 54:37.106
- Hi. To Angela.
- Sorry.

57:19.537 --> 57:22.905
Wayne called. No message.

58:37.014 --> 58:38.881
Wayne? Wayne!

58:38.983 --> 58:40.582
No! No! No!

58:40.684 --> 58:42.985
Wayne! Wayne!

59:34.772 --> 59:36.838
Everything

59:36.941 --> 59:39.341
is gonna be... fine.

59:53.257 --> 59:55.958
Hey, you got this.

59:56.060 --> 59:59.194
- <i>15-0-7.</i>
<i>-  Hey.</i>

59:59.296 --> 01:00:02.297
- It's a home monitor security.
- So what do we got?

01:00:02.399 --> 01:00:04.366
For now, it appears
the old man

01:00:04.468 --> 01:00:07.035
took a header
down the stairs.

01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:09.805
He'd been drinking.

01:00:09.907 --> 01:00:11.373
Found an empty
scotch box in his room.

01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:13.208
That's it?

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:15.129
That's it.

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:28.168
He has 150 yards
around the house for no reason.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:33.462
Hey, how you doing?
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.467
Just him, ma'am.

01:00:41.672 --> 01:00:44.573
So what were you
doing here anyway?

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:49.611
I...I was
just out, um,

01:00:49.713 --> 01:00:51.847
for a run, and I...

01:00:51.949 --> 01:00:54.016
I, stopped
to catch my breath.

01:00:54.118 --> 01:00:57.719
And I checked my phone and saw
that he had called earlier.

01:00:57.821 --> 01:01:00.022
...You know,

01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:02.135
ever since Grace's been dealing
with what she's going through,

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:04.059
we've been talking
pretty regularly.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:06.061
- Grace?
- Yeah. It's Grace.

01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:09.531
Another neighbour who's been
dealing with a stalker thing.

01:01:09.633 --> 01:01:12.768
She's filed with the police.
Who's handling her case?

01:01:15.039 --> 01:01:17.639
Detectives Gregory and Johnson.
Listen,

01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:20.308
you left your info with the
responding officer over there,

01:01:20.411 --> 01:01:22.778
so if I need you for anything...
Yeah, I just...

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:26.114
Alright. You can go.

01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:42.631
Hey.

01:01:42.733 --> 01:01:45.667
Let's head out the door handles
and cabinet knobs to prints;

01:01:45.769 --> 01:01:48.670
make sure our man here didn't
have any unwanted visitors.

01:01:48.772 --> 01:01:50.672
Yeah, OK.

01:02:12.796 --> 01:02:14.796
He was such
a wonderful man.

01:02:19.369 --> 01:02:21.470
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:26.374
I just can't believe
any of this.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:33.281
Did the detective say anything to
you when you were talking to him?

01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:37.986
He just wanted to know
what I was doing there,

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:39.907
you know, and how I...

01:02:41.725 --> 01:02:43.658
I found him.

01:02:43.761 --> 01:02:46.161
I just thought
that you

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:48.163
pointed to me
at one point.

01:02:50.534 --> 01:02:52.467
Yeah...Yes.

01:02:52.569 --> 01:02:55.971
I was telling him
about your situation.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.975
To Wayne.

01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:02.077
To Wayne.

01:03:11.054 --> 01:03:13.294
You know I'm
gonna go freshen up real quick

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:16.124
because I know this is just
a mess. I'll be right back.

01:05:12.676 --> 01:05:16.278
I'm sorry.

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.313
I must have fallen
asleep last night.

01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:20.348
It's OK. That's OK.

01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:27.722
I gotta go. Big day.
Thank you, Robert.

01:05:29.493 --> 01:05:31.459
I'm happy we weren't alone
last night.

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:36.564
Me too.

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:42.003
Wait. Would you mind

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:44.072
if I made you
dinner tonight?

01:05:46.076 --> 01:05:47.895
Sounds nice.

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:55.457
Reminds me those papers
are due next class.

01:05:55.519 --> 01:05:57.786
I suggest you get started.

01:06:05.896 --> 01:06:07.929
Detective, what can
I do for you?

01:06:11.268 --> 01:06:14.002
Just some follow-up.

01:06:14.104 --> 01:06:15.704
Listen, doing our door-to-doors,

01:06:15.806 --> 01:06:18.340
we learned that your neighbours
heard what could have been

01:06:18.442 --> 01:06:20.342
a gunshot or firecrackers

01:06:20.444 --> 01:06:22.377
or a car backfiring.
Did you hear anything?

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:24.612
No.

01:06:24.715 --> 01:06:26.614
No, but I... I mean,
I had my headphones in

01:06:26.717 --> 01:06:28.616
'til I got to the house.

01:06:28.719 --> 01:06:30.618
Wayne wasn't shot, was he?

01:06:30.721 --> 01:06:32.988
No, no, no, no,
he wasn't. I mean,

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:34.990
we found a bullet hole
in his wall

01:06:35.092 --> 01:06:38.893
and a .45-calibre
bullet, except

01:06:38.996 --> 01:06:40.895
he had a Colt revolver
registered in his name.

01:06:40.998 --> 01:06:43.798
Now because of that,
we tested his hands. Guess what.

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:46.334
We found gunpowder residue.
He fired it?

01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:50.739
- Looks like it, yeah.
- So, it wasn't an accident?

01:06:50.841 --> 01:06:53.008
I mean, someone...
someone killed him?

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:55.510
Well, we won't know that
until the autopsy results

01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:57.812
and the analysis
of the fall.

01:06:57.914 --> 01:06:59.981
<i>We also couldn't find</i>

01:07:00.083 --> 01:07:01.983
<i>any cell phone,</i>

01:07:02.085 --> 01:07:03.985
<i>you know. And in my experience,</i>

01:07:04.087 --> 01:07:06.199
the only guns and phones
that leave the scene of a crime

01:07:06.223 --> 01:07:09.290
are the ones being carried out,
so somebody was in that house.

01:07:13.497 --> 01:07:16.865
<i>Listen. I'd like to learn more
about Grace's stalker.</i>

01:07:16.967 --> 01:07:18.867
<i>So would I.
But I already told you</i>

01:07:18.969 --> 01:07:21.736
everything I know. Have you talked
to the detectives working the case?

01:07:21.838 --> 01:07:24.205
Yes, I did, but they didn't
find any physical evidence,

01:07:24.307 --> 01:07:27.587
just a lot of incident reports. There's more
than reports. I mean, the girl was attacked.

01:07:27.611 --> 01:07:30.845
I understand. I understand.
Here's what I'm thinking though:

01:07:30.947 --> 01:07:34.482
maybe Wayne finally found or saw
something that made him a liability.

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.753
Now, from what we gathered,
he started looking

01:07:38.855 --> 01:07:40.889
into her past, right?
When she was married,

01:07:40.991 --> 01:07:42.891
when she was Gracie Winston.

01:07:42.993 --> 01:07:45.326
Really?

01:07:47.064 --> 01:07:48.930
<i>How much
do you know about her?</i>

01:07:49.032 --> 01:07:51.433
I know she was married,

01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:54.235
widowed. Lost her husband
to brain cancer.

01:07:54.337 --> 01:07:55.970
- Cancer?!
- Yes.

01:07:58.008 --> 01:08:00.642
But he died from a broken neck
when he fell off a ladder.

01:08:10.821 --> 01:08:12.754
<i>No, it was, </i>

01:08:12.856 --> 01:08:14.889
it was a brain tumour.

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:20.095
Wow. Well, either you're wrong
or the Mount Vernon PD

01:08:20.197 --> 01:08:23.009
and the insurance company that lists the
cause of death is. Did she tell you

01:08:23.033 --> 01:08:23.997
it was cancer?
Yes.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.801
- So she lied.
- I-I, I guess.

01:08:26.903 --> 01:08:29.270
I'm sure she had her reasons
why. If you have any questions,

01:08:29.372 --> 01:08:31.606
why don't you just ask her?
I plan to.

01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:34.776
Listen, when was the last time
you communicated

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:37.745
with Wayne anyway?
A few days ago.

01:08:37.848 --> 01:08:40.415
- Not yesterday?
- No, I told you, I missed his call.

01:08:40.517 --> 01:08:42.617
But what about a text?

01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:46.287
- I don't think so.
- His phone record showed a text

01:08:46.389 --> 01:08:48.790
to you around the time
of the call.

01:08:48.892 --> 01:08:51.960
No. See? Nothing.

01:08:52.062 --> 01:08:54.796
OK. Well,

01:08:54.898 --> 01:08:56.716
once we locate his phone,

01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:58.666
then we will probably
clear that up.

01:08:58.768 --> 01:09:01.002
One other item,

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:04.104
sorry.
You make anything of this?

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:09.310
Well, we think
it's from a blouse.

01:09:09.412 --> 01:09:11.312
We found it upstairs
at Wayne's place.

01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:16.251
It's probably just
one of these weird things.

01:09:16.353 --> 01:09:19.888
Have a good day.

01:09:56.092 --> 01:09:57.926
Hey, dude.

01:09:58.028 --> 01:10:00.328
Hey, man.

01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:03.631
You OK?
Wayne's dead.

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:07.335
- That old man from the block?
- Yeah.

01:10:07.437 --> 01:10:10.405
Wow. That blows, man.
What happened?

01:10:12.876 --> 01:10:14.709
Not sure.

01:10:14.811 --> 01:10:17.212
Look, if there was a text
message erased from a phone,

01:10:17.314 --> 01:10:19.292
is there any way to retrieve it?
Yeah. It depends

01:10:19.316 --> 01:10:21.282
on a number of factors:
model of phone, carrier...

01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:23.203
Could you
check it out?

01:10:23.286 --> 01:10:25.286
Yeah, sure. We'll mirror
the info to my computer;

01:10:25.322 --> 01:10:27.855
I'll see what I can find.
Great.

01:10:44.641 --> 01:10:46.341
Hi. Haha!

01:10:46.443 --> 01:10:48.376
Come in.

01:10:54.818 --> 01:10:56.637
This way.

01:11:02.492 --> 01:11:04.392
You look stressed.

01:11:04.494 --> 01:11:07.295
Here, I'll bring you
a glass of wine.

01:11:07.397 --> 01:11:10.265
No thank you.
I-I don't want to drink tonight.

01:11:10.367 --> 01:11:13.901
OK.

01:11:14.004 --> 01:11:16.804
Well, sit down, relax.
Make yourself at home.

01:11:16.906 --> 01:11:18.725
Yeah.

01:11:25.348 --> 01:11:28.650
Haha!

01:11:28.752 --> 01:11:30.752
I know this might sound silly,

01:11:30.854 --> 01:11:33.621
but I would love it
if you signed my book.

01:11:33.723 --> 01:11:35.590
I thought it'd be cheesy

01:11:35.692 --> 01:11:39.160
to ask you the other day
at the bookstore.

01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:43.097
OK. Now, you officially
have me worried.

01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:45.166
Sorry.

01:11:45.268 --> 01:11:48.136
My mind just keeps
going back

01:11:48.238 --> 01:11:50.371
to that first night

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:52.774
we went out
after the break-in.

01:11:52.876 --> 01:11:55.510
The drinks at Gastro?

01:11:55.612 --> 01:11:57.612
I remember it.

01:11:57.714 --> 01:12:00.448
That was the night that we
really got to know each other.

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:03.017
Yeah. That was, wasn't it?

01:12:03.119 --> 01:12:06.654
- Yes.
- Yeah.

01:12:06.756 --> 01:12:09.991
Yeah, you were
so open with me.

01:12:10.093 --> 01:12:12.060
You told me about
your husband...

01:12:14.064 --> 01:12:16.531
and how he died
of lung cancer.

01:12:16.633 --> 01:12:20.301
- Brain tumour.
- Brain tumour.

01:12:20.403 --> 01:12:23.237
Right. Sorry.
No,

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:25.660
that's OK. We've both been
through a lot in the last month.

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:32.380
That was the night
when all this...

01:12:34.417 --> 01:12:36.317
weirdness started happening,

01:12:36.419 --> 01:12:38.364
and before, this was such
a nice, quiet neighbourhood.

01:12:38.388 --> 01:12:40.755
But it still is.

01:12:43.293 --> 01:12:45.226
OK, let's eat dinner.

01:12:45.328 --> 01:12:47.729
You know I'm not really
all that hungry.

01:12:47.831 --> 01:12:49.731
Even if it's not much,
you really should try

01:12:49.833 --> 01:12:52.166
to eat something.

01:12:52.268 --> 01:12:54.502
<i>Even if it's not much,
you should try eating something.</i>

01:12:56.773 --> 01:12:59.173
<i>Even if it's not much,
you should try eating something.</i>

01:12:59.275 --> 01:13:00.942
Robert?

01:13:01.044 --> 01:13:04.312
- Can you pass the wine?
- Right.

01:13:08.952 --> 01:13:11.686
Something wrong, Robert?

01:13:11.788 --> 01:13:15.089
Not feeling well.

01:13:17.394 --> 01:13:19.360
excuse me.

01:13:19.462 --> 01:13:21.162
Robert?

01:13:21.264 --> 01:13:24.031
Just give me a minute.

01:13:40.116 --> 01:13:42.350
<i>"Found this
It was deleted off your phone.</i>

01:13:42.452 --> 01:13:44.852
<i>'911. Call as soon as you can.
It's about Grace.'"</i>

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:49.435
<i> Did you get a good look
to be able to give a description?</i>

01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:51.437
<i>I couldn't tell.
He slipped away too fast.</i>

01:13:51.461 --> 01:13:53.561
No forced entry,
no broken windows,

01:13:53.663 --> 01:13:55.763
no evidence of any kind
that there was someone there.

01:13:55.865 --> 01:13:58.900
<i>People are weird.
They get off on strange stuff.</i>

01:13:59.002 --> 01:14:01.636
It was 50 bucks for 30 messages,
man. That was it.

01:14:01.738 --> 01:14:04.572
<i>Did the detective say anything
to you? I just thought that</i>

01:14:04.674 --> 01:14:08.075
you pointed to me at one point. <i>The
only guns and phones that leave</i>

01:14:08.178 --> 01:14:10.156
the scene of a crime
are the ones being carried out,

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.814
so somebody was in that house.

01:14:12.916 --> 01:14:15.249
I don't want you guys
to leave.

01:14:15.351 --> 01:14:18.085
<i>You're not alone.
Wayne is just a couple of doors</i>

01:14:18.188 --> 01:14:19.720
down from you.
Wayne.

01:14:19.823 --> 01:14:22.623
I do have Wayne,
but Wayne is not you.

01:14:22.725 --> 01:14:26.327
Maybe Wayne finally found or saw
something that made him a liability.

01:14:26.429 --> 01:14:29.263
<i>Now from what we gathered, he
started looking into her past.</i>

01:14:29.365 --> 01:14:31.399
When she was married,
when she was Gracie Winston.

01:14:31.501 --> 01:14:34.068
<i>It was a long,
tough battle, but</i>

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:37.472
in the end, he was at peace.:
<i>Did she tell you it was cancer?</i>

01:14:37.574 --> 01:14:39.507
- Yes.
- So she lied.

01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:05.233
Are you feeling
any better?

01:15:13.109 --> 01:15:16.477
Just... confused.

01:15:16.579 --> 01:15:18.679
About everything.
A lot of questions.

01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:22.416
That's understandable.

01:15:22.519 --> 01:15:26.187
I've grown to really care
about you, Grace.

01:15:27.991 --> 01:15:29.991
I feel the same.

01:15:30.093 --> 01:15:32.393
It's been there
ever since...

01:15:32.495 --> 01:15:35.129
- Was that the night we met?
- Outside of the market.

01:15:35.231 --> 01:15:37.698
Outside that market.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.834
Yeah, fate put us there
in that moment.

01:15:39.936 --> 01:15:41.755
It did.

01:15:41.838 --> 01:15:44.472
I'm so happy
you came into my life.

01:15:44.574 --> 01:15:46.474
I've never met anyone
quite like you.

01:15:46.576 --> 01:15:49.677
I've never known
anyone like you either.

01:15:52.649 --> 01:15:55.683
But if these feelings
are real, are true,

01:15:55.785 --> 01:15:57.685
if we are to be soulmates,

01:15:57.787 --> 01:16:00.187
then we can't have
any lies between us.

01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:03.858
I haven't...

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.960
You haven't been
truthful with me.

01:16:08.598 --> 01:16:11.732
I found the message from Wayne
you deleted from my phone.

01:16:15.538 --> 01:16:18.239
- I don't want you to hate me.
- I can never.

01:16:20.043 --> 01:16:23.511
To love is to forgive.
And to forgive is to love.

01:16:23.613 --> 01:16:25.432
And you have

01:16:25.515 --> 01:16:27.381
done so much to bring us

01:16:27.483 --> 01:16:30.985
together, haven't you?
Yes.

01:16:32.989 --> 01:16:35.423
I can tell.
And I'm so appreciative

01:16:35.525 --> 01:16:38.125
that I want to show you
how appreciative I am.

01:16:38.227 --> 01:16:41.128
I don't want this time
to go to waste.

01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:43.364
- What do you mean?
- If there's anything

01:16:43.466 --> 01:16:46.934
anyone could use
to keep us apart,

01:16:47.036 --> 01:16:49.937
then we have to take care
of it, now, together.

01:16:51.908 --> 01:16:54.475
I don't want to be apart.
I want to be with you.

01:16:54.577 --> 01:16:57.345
You want to be with me?
Of course.

01:16:57.447 --> 01:16:59.480
Of course.

01:17:03.252 --> 01:17:05.219
At Erin's memorial...

01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:10.424
you were wearing
this black blouse,

01:17:10.526 --> 01:17:12.960
and there...

01:17:13.062 --> 01:17:15.296
these tiny,

01:17:15.398 --> 01:17:17.632
little buttons
that shined.

01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:20.134
And you, you played
with them.

01:17:20.236 --> 01:17:23.571
I... I was so nervous
that day.

01:17:29.112 --> 01:17:31.412
It was such a horrible day.

01:17:31.514 --> 01:17:33.581
I mean, you suffered
so tremendously.

01:17:33.683 --> 01:17:36.584
I wanted to make sure
that everything went

01:17:36.686 --> 01:17:38.686
smoothly for you.

01:17:40.523 --> 01:17:43.057
The police found one of
those buttons at Wayne's house.

01:17:45.094 --> 01:17:47.828
So, if you haven't already,

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:49.964
then you need to get rid
of that blouse.

01:18:03.246 --> 01:18:05.112
It's...

01:18:05.214 --> 01:18:07.848
it's buried
in the garbage.

01:18:09.752 --> 01:18:11.719
We should burn it.

01:18:13.623 --> 01:18:15.523
And we need to get rid
of Wayne's gun too.

01:18:15.625 --> 01:18:17.792
I mean, the police haven't
found it in his house.

01:18:20.263 --> 01:18:22.274
of the evidence with you, it'd
make me complicit in his murder

01:18:22.298 --> 01:18:24.398
and it would

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.468
it would bound us together.

01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:29.103
Forever.

01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:46.420
I didn't...

01:18:46.522 --> 01:18:49.523
I didn't want
to store it anywhere.

01:18:49.625 --> 01:18:52.093
I mean, what if a kid found it?

01:18:52.195 --> 01:18:54.161
Hurt himself or someone else?
Sure.

01:18:54.263 --> 01:18:56.630
Of course. Of course.

01:18:56.733 --> 01:18:58.733
Well, we need
to get rid of it.

01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:05.639
Where is it?

01:19:09.178 --> 01:19:11.812
It's over there,
in that vent.

01:19:14.217 --> 01:19:16.117
Wayne was always
sticking his nose

01:19:16.219 --> 01:19:18.586
into everyone's
else business.

01:19:18.688 --> 01:19:20.688
I knew it would be
his undoing eventually.

01:19:24.327 --> 01:19:26.146
Well...

01:19:28.164 --> 01:19:30.364
He didn't want us
to be together.

01:19:30.466 --> 01:19:32.366
Yeah.

01:19:32.468 --> 01:19:34.435
No one did.

01:19:34.537 --> 01:19:36.537
No one can keep us
apart now.

01:19:36.639 --> 01:19:39.106
I just need that gun.
I can't...

01:19:39.208 --> 01:19:42.610
I can't seem to reach it.

01:19:42.712 --> 01:19:45.012
Are you sure
that's the right...?

01:19:46.682 --> 01:19:48.916
Every time

01:19:49.018 --> 01:19:51.285
that I've been in trouble,
you've been there for me.

01:19:53.523 --> 01:19:55.556
That's love, Robert.
Pointing a gun

01:19:55.658 --> 01:19:58.459
at me isn't love.
Threatening my life isn't love.

01:20:00.863 --> 01:20:02.963
I've done so much to show you

01:20:03.065 --> 01:20:05.199
how much I love you,
and you don't even care!

01:20:07.336 --> 01:20:09.236
I mean, she didn't love you;

01:20:09.338 --> 01:20:11.372
I had to deliver you from her!

01:20:13.342 --> 01:20:15.242
- Erin?
- Yes, Erin,

01:20:15.344 --> 01:20:17.645
Robert.

01:20:19.081 --> 01:20:21.015
You're sick, Grace.

01:20:25.855 --> 01:20:27.855
You're just like
my husband.

01:20:30.026 --> 01:20:33.861
You know, he lost
faith in me too.

01:20:33.963 --> 01:20:36.630
You know,
it should be so simple:

01:20:36.732 --> 01:20:39.600
you just have to love me.

01:20:42.205 --> 01:20:44.104
I loved Erin.

01:20:44.207 --> 01:20:47.007
She was my life.

01:20:47.109 --> 01:20:49.844
Just put the gun down.
She didn't love you,

01:20:49.946 --> 01:20:52.780
Robert!

01:20:52.882 --> 01:20:55.616
She was stealing
your life away from you.

01:20:55.718 --> 01:20:57.618
You didn't want to move.

01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.855
She was forcing you
to sacrifice everything

01:21:00.957 --> 01:21:03.157
while she sacrificed nothing!

01:21:03.259 --> 01:21:05.993
I chose her.

01:21:06.095 --> 01:21:09.196
OK? I chose her.
I chose

01:21:09.298 --> 01:21:12.166
a life with her.
I have done

01:21:12.268 --> 01:21:15.502
everything so that we could
finally be together.

01:21:15.605 --> 01:21:17.738
You lied
about everything, Grace.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:20.140
- It was all for us!
- OK.

01:21:20.243 --> 01:21:22.309
- It was all for us.
- Put the gun down.

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.480
I want you

01:21:26.582 --> 01:21:29.483
to love me, Robert. Haha!

01:21:29.585 --> 01:21:32.753
I just...
wanna hear you say it.

01:21:32.855 --> 01:21:34.755
Just once.

01:21:34.857 --> 01:21:37.024
Robert, I want
to hear you say it.

01:21:42.131 --> 01:21:44.598
Just once,
just say it.

01:21:46.802 --> 01:21:49.670
I love you.

01:21:54.176 --> 01:21:57.111
- No!
- You need help, Grace.

01:21:57.213 --> 01:22:00.014
I just need you, Robert!
I just need you!

01:22:00.116 --> 01:22:02.516
I'm gonna give you
what you need!

01:22:02.618 --> 01:22:04.018
Love me!

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.553
Robert, love me!
Stop! Stop fighting!

01:22:08.691 --> 01:22:10.591
Don't! OK, easy, easy!

01:22:10.693 --> 01:22:12.960
Easy.
As long as we're together,

01:22:13.062 --> 01:22:15.596
everything will be alright.
Grace, I need you

01:22:15.698 --> 01:22:17.531
to put that knife down.

01:22:17.633 --> 01:22:19.366
I'll always be there for you.
I'll always come for you.

01:22:22.204 --> 01:22:24.023
You're lying.

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:40.087
What are you doing? Don't.

01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:42.222
Don't. Don't.

01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:03.577
He loves me.

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:05.579
