WEBVTT

00:08.967 --> 00:10.427
- Good morning.
- Morning.

00:10.427 --> 00:13.138
- Requisition reports for the week.
- Thanks.

00:13.764 --> 00:16.058
What can you tell me about the Great Wall of China?

00:16.265 --> 00:17.100
Pardon?

00:17.309 --> 00:19.811
The Great Wall of China, on Earth. Who built it?

00:20.020 --> 00:21.063
The Chinese.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.523
What for?

00:22.523 --> 00:24.608
Why does anybody build a wall? To keep people out.

00:24.608 --> 00:25.442
Deck one.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.362
In fact it was the first Q'in emperor

00:28.362 --> 00:31.073
who connected the walls built by a previous dynasty.

00:31.073 --> 00:35.244
He did it to prevent an invasion by nomads to the north. How big is it?

00:35.452 --> 00:37.120
I have a feeling you're going to tell me.

00:37.246 --> 00:40.040
Twenty four hundred kilometres long, median width three point eight metres.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.585
Before the twenty second century it was one of the only manmade objects

00:43.585 --> 00:45.879
that could be seen from Earth's orbit with the naked eye.

00:46.296 --> 00:47.548
Very impressive, Neelix.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.842
I had no idea you knew so much about my homeworld.

00:52.135 --> 00:52.553
Status?

00:52.761 --> 00:54.221
We're on a course for the class Y cluster.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.681
We should be there in about three days.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.349
Gives us some time to relax. Carry on.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.060
Why this sudden interest in the Great Wall?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.937
I've been studying Earth landmarks.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.482
Mister Paris and I have been exchanging a little cross-cultural trivia.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.568
He's become quite an expert on Talaxian geography.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.236
All right, here's one for you.

01:09.653 --> 01:12.155
What can you tell me about the Millennium Gate?

01:12.155 --> 01:13.615
The Millennium Gate.

01:13.615 --> 01:17.369
Constructed in the 21st century in the United States of America.

01:17.995 --> 01:20.080
It was another one of the objects that could be seen from orbit.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.834
Three point two kilometres at the base, one kilometre in height,

01:24.042 --> 01:27.171
surface covered with highly reflective solar panels.

01:27.171 --> 01:29.464
A self-contained ecosystem.

01:29.882 --> 01:32.384
It became a model for the first colony on Mars.

01:32.801 --> 01:35.095
Did you know that one of my ancestors built it?

01:36.263 --> 01:36.847
Really?

01:37.181 --> 01:40.309
Not with a hammer and nails, but with words and a lot of courage.

01:40.726 --> 01:43.437
Shannon O'Donnell, one of the first woman astronauts.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.522
She was the driving force behind the project.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.399
That's something to be proud of.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.527
We were always told stories about her at family gatherings.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.655
The first of a long line of Janeway explorers.

01:54.281 --> 01:58.035
Tell me more. I want something to stump Mister Paris with.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.537
Where to begin?

02:00.537 --> 02:03.040
The Millennium Gate. How did she get involved with that?

02:03.457 --> 02:05.751
Well, at that time, she was still in the space program,

02:05.959 --> 02:08.252
but she'd also become something of an entrepreneur.

02:09.086 --> 02:12.007
I believe she was asked to join the project by the governor of Indiana.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.761
He wanted her expertise on recyclic life support systems.

02:16.386 --> 02:20.140
The way my aunt Martha tells it they flew her in on a private aircraft.

02:25.562 --> 02:33.487
Five a. m. December 27, 2000. I'm in the great state of Indiana, I think.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.823
I saw the world's largest ball of string this morning,

02:37.658 --> 02:40.369
and the world's largest beefsteak tomato this afternoon.

02:40.994 --> 02:44.957
It was the size of a Volkswagen. The string, not the tomato.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.085
At least Christmas is over.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.004
Oh, no.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:10.310 --> 05:13.021
Excuse me.
I think I made a wrong turn.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.315
Is there a Millennium Gate around here?

05:15.524 --> 05:16.567
You're looking at it.

05:16.567 --> 05:19.903
The sign said gas, food, lodging. I need all three.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.363
You won't find any of that here.

05:21.363 --> 05:24.491
Get back on the Interstate and go to exit nine.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.577
- I don't think I'm gong to make it
- Good luck.

05:27.202 --> 05:31.790
Tell me, are people a little friendlier off exit nine?

05:33.876 --> 05:35.335
Oh, no.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.848
- You stopped.
- You didn't. Got a pen?

05:48.682 --> 05:50.767
I, I just didn't see you.
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

05:51.185 --> 05:53.061
- Insurance?
- Not really.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.564
- Not really?
- It ran out.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.986
It's not too bad. Two hundred bucks ought to cover it.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.863
Two hundred bucks?

06:04.531 --> 06:06.200
Let me guess,
the money ran out, too.

07:23.986 --> 07:25.863
- Hi.
- Hi

07:27.322 --> 07:29.825
- The sign said open?
- Yes, that's right.

07:30.367 --> 07:34.413
Till six o'clock.
Can we be of assistance?

07:34.830 --> 07:37.958
It's cold outside, and I wondered if I could wait here.

07:39.418 --> 07:40.043
For what?

07:40.252 --> 07:42.963
For the tow truck.
My car broke down.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.631
I'm trying to get to Florida.

07:45.883 --> 07:47.551
She doesn't look like a corporate hit man.

07:48.177 --> 07:50.679
I assure you I'm not.
At least not anymore.

07:52.139 --> 07:57.144
Well, in any case, she's unarmed and chilled to the bone.

07:57.769 --> 08:02.983
I think we can handle her. Zeus himself watched over travellers.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.528
We should follow his example.
Make yourself at home.

08:06.528 --> 08:07.571
Thank you.

08:14.244 --> 08:15.495
Where's your car?

08:15.621 --> 08:17.581
Down the street, next to the coffee shop.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.458
What used to be the coffee shop.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.752
It looks like this whole town is closed down.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.003
It is.

08:23.629 --> 08:24.880
Except for you, huh?

08:25.714 --> 08:28.425
This ship will never sink.
Right, Dad?

08:29.051 --> 08:30.093
Decaf.

08:33.222 --> 08:36.558
- Not exactly the nectar of the gods.
- It'll do. Thank you.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.813
- What's this about, if I may ask.
- Preserving the past.

08:43.232 --> 08:45.526
- I'm Jason, by the way.
- Shannon O'Donnell.

08:46.151 --> 08:49.696
- I'm Henry. Henry Janeway.
- Hi.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.824
So, you're trying to get them to stop building this

08:52.824 --> 08:55.536
- Millennium whatever-it-is?
- The Millennium Gate.

08:55.536 --> 08:58.038
The world's first self-sustaining civic environment.

08:58.038 --> 09:02.209
That's what the propaganda calls it. It's nothing but hype.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.877
It's actually a glorified shopping mall.

09:05.337 --> 09:08.465
They've talked all of my neighbours into selling their businesses.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.385
Only one thing stands in their way.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.721
You're the last holdout?

09:14.721 --> 09:17.850
This time, Rome withstands the barbarians.

09:30.571 --> 09:33.490
I may be able to help you,
if you'd be willing to hire me.

09:33.699 --> 09:36.618
Believe me, you don't want to be licking stamps for the next two days.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.495
We could do all this on a computer.

09:38.495 --> 09:41.832
Yeah, but my dad doesn't believe in computers. We don't even have one.

09:42.249 --> 09:46.003
Well I do. We can e-mail every computer within a hundred miles.

09:46.003 --> 09:47.462
It'll just take a few hours.
It's easy.

09:49.339 --> 09:54.553
I'm not hiring anybody right now.
Besides, you're going to Florida.

10:04.146 --> 10:09.776
Maybe the tow truck is waiting.
Thanks for the coffee.

10:10.819 --> 10:11.862
You're welcome.

10:28.545 --> 10:31.465
I wouldn't ask you for a lot.
Just enough to fix the car.

10:31.465 --> 10:36.053
I really, I kind of need a job right now.

10:37.930 --> 10:38.764
Dad.

10:42.518 --> 10:45.229
I suppose we could use some help.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.409
You do believe in electricity, don't you?

11:10.879 --> 11:13.173
So, who are these barbarians, anyway?

11:13.382 --> 11:16.510
- A company down in Texas.
- Why come here?

11:16.927 --> 11:19.012
The City Fathers made it easy for them.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.932
Free building permits, deferred taxes, new roads,

11:21.932 --> 11:24.017
so the invaders,
they return the favour.

11:25.060 --> 11:29.231
They have offered us twenty percent above the market price for our properties.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.359
You know what the catch is?
We've all got to sell.

11:32.985 --> 11:35.070
Everybody must love you.

11:36.113 --> 11:38.615
People I knew when I was growing up, family friends,

11:38.615 --> 11:40.701
it seems like they've all just turned against me.

11:40.909 --> 11:43.829
If this were Roman times,
they'd feed me to the lions.

11:44.246 --> 11:45.289
To the good old days.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.625
You know, I was born in the wrong millennium.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.294
I'll stick with the modern age.

11:50.294 --> 11:53.213
The classical age. Greatest literature mankind ever produced.

11:53.630 --> 11:54.882
No antibiotics.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.550
Families who'd take care of one another.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.052
- No cars.
- Air you can breathe.

11:59.261 --> 12:01.138
- No telephones.
- What a pleasure.

12:01.555 --> 12:04.057
- Shorter life spans.
- Lives that were worth living.

12:04.266 --> 12:07.603
- No cold beer.
- There you got me.

12:10.522 --> 12:14.693
Speaking of the modern age, Do you have any plans for the Millennium Eve?

12:15.110 --> 12:18.030
No different than last year's Millennium Eve. I plan to be asleep.

12:18.447 --> 12:19.698
Life of the party.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.409
Oh, don't tell me you've bought into all that hype again?

12:22.492 --> 12:24.077
Oh, maybe just a little.

12:24.286 --> 12:26.121
Last year, when 2000 arrived?

12:26.163 --> 12:28.457
Everyone was convinced it was the dawn of a new era.

12:28.665 --> 12:31.376
But when the world didn't end and the flying saucers didn't land

12:31.376 --> 12:34.713
and the Y2K bug didn't turn off a single light bulb,

12:34.713 --> 12:37.424
you'd think everybody would have realised it was a number on a calendar.

12:37.633 --> 12:40.344
But, oh, no, they had to listen to all those hucksters

12:40.344 --> 12:43.263
who told them the real millennium was 2001.

12:43.472 --> 12:46.600
So this New Year's Eve will be as boring as last year.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.937
Come to think about it, I have sold an awful lot of doomsday books.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.188
See what I mean?

12:52.856 --> 12:54.525
So, what's in Florida?

12:54.733 --> 12:56.193
I have a cousin down there.

12:56.401 --> 12:59.112
I'll stay with her for a while until I can get back on my feet.

12:59.321 --> 13:02.658
If you don't mind my asking, did you lose your job?

13:04.952 --> 13:08.080
- I'm in a transitional period.
- From what to what.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.208
From what I was doing to what I'm going to do.

13:13.710 --> 13:17.256
Your son tells me that your bookstore's belonged in your family for generations.

13:17.256 --> 13:18.715
That you've never done anything else.

13:18.715 --> 13:19.925
Yes.
That's right.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.635
You know, I'm just the opposite.

13:22.469 --> 13:25.389
I love to see places I've never been, try new things.

13:26.431 --> 13:27.683
I'm kind of an explorer.

13:28.517 --> 13:29.351
Really?

13:30.602 --> 13:34.147
That station wagon of yours doesn't exactly look like a sailing ship.

13:34.356 --> 13:37.067
- It's a rocket ship.
- My mistake.

14:04.595 --> 14:06.889
We have every intention of breaking ground on Monday.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.348
Day one of the next millennium.

14:08.557 --> 14:11.059
The people of this town have given us their full cooperation.

14:11.059 --> 14:12.102
That's not true!

14:12.519 --> 14:14.605
If you'll let me finish, Mister Janeway.

14:14.605 --> 14:16.690
With the exception of Mister Janeway here.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.567
Mister Janeway, would you like to comment?

14:19.818 --> 14:25.032
Yes. Yes, I would. You, you just can't, you can't bulldoze this town away.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.117
This, this is our heritage.
This is our past.

14:27.326 --> 14:29.411
We're trying to give Portage Creek a future. Can't you see that?

14:29.411 --> 14:32.956
Yeah, yeah, your, your future. Your future, not ours.

14:33.999 --> 14:37.753
Mister Moss, we've heard you're considering moving the project to an alternate site.

14:37.753 --> 14:39.004
Can you shed any light on that rumour?

14:39.004 --> 14:40.464
I'm afraid that's more than a rumour.

14:40.464 --> 14:42.341
If we can't work out an arrangement in Portage Creek

14:42.341 --> 14:44.635
we'll have no choice but to select another location.

14:44.635 --> 14:46.303
- What city?
- No comment.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.180
Is it true that Canton, Ohio has been chosen for

14:48.180 --> 14:50.474
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you, Mister Moss.

14:50.891 --> 14:54.853
Well, that's that. All we have to do is stand firm till New Year's.

14:54.853 --> 14:57.773
Easy for you to say. I have to go to school with their kids.

14:58.190 --> 15:00.484
Your school is one of the first places they're going to tear down.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.986
They said they'd build a new one, a better one.

15:03.612 --> 15:08.200
Whose side are you on?
I'm sorry.

15:10.285 --> 15:14.665
We're all in this together. Come on. Let's head back to civilisation.

15:25.300 --> 15:30.931
Where shall we dine tonight?
Ah, how does Paris sound?

15:31.557 --> 15:33.851
It's Friday night.
Can we get a reservation?

15:34.059 --> 15:36.562
Well, I think I can arrange it.
I know the maitre d.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.438
Too bad I don't speak French.

15:39.064 --> 15:43.443
Well, we'll keep it to ourselves.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.031
There.

15:50.742 --> 15:53.245
- To new friends.
- And a gracious host.

15:54.079 --> 15:54.913
Bon appetit.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.918
I wouldn't mind visiting Paris one day.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.421
- Yes, it'd be nice.
- You haven't been?

16:02.546 --> 16:04.715
I haven't been outside Indiana.

16:04.923 --> 16:08.886
These are my travelling companions.
They'll take me anywhere, anytime.

16:09.094 --> 16:12.222
It's not such a bad idea to experience the real thing every now and then.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.891
I prefer my books.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.810
Maybe you just never had the right guide.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.521
Is that an offer?

16:20.147 --> 16:21.815
I could make a similar argument.

16:22.024 --> 16:25.986
Not such a bad idea to settle down every now and then.

16:26.111 --> 16:27.237
Is that an offer?

16:30.574 --> 16:35.370
You're a peculiar man Mister Janeway,
cloistered away with all your books.

16:35.579 --> 16:37.247
Shutting out the world.

16:37.664 --> 16:41.418
Any more peculiar than exploring the Midwest in an ailing station wagon?

16:42.044 --> 16:46.215
Only slightly.
Any word on my car?

16:46.632 --> 16:48.091
It's got a brand new oil pan.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.428
You forgot to tell me that.

16:51.637 --> 16:53.722
Well, we were busy today.

16:53.931 --> 16:56.225
It's parked behind the garage whenever you're ready.

16:57.684 --> 16:58.936
First thing in the morning.

16:59.353 --> 17:00.604
Not so fast.

17:00.604 --> 17:03.941
Jason told me you promised to show him a few tricks on the computer.

17:06.652 --> 17:08.319
I could use another day of rest.

17:08.529 --> 17:11.031
Great.
Jason will be pleased.

17:12.907 --> 17:13.951
And when you're done with him

17:13.951 --> 17:17.496
perhaps we'll take a stroll along the Boulevard St. Germain.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.126
You're making it difficult to say goodbye.

17:24.169 --> 17:26.046
Maybe that's the idea.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.355
You wished to see me, Captain?

17:43.355 --> 17:46.900
I need your help with this.
The Millennium Gate.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.777
Impressive.

17:48.986 --> 17:51.905
It was built by one of my ancestors over three hundred years ago.

17:52.739 --> 17:55.242
I've been digging through the historical database

17:55.242 --> 17:57.953
but a lot of the information from that era has been lost or damaged

17:58.370 --> 18:00.873
I thought you might be able to help me reconstruct some of it.

18:02.958 --> 18:05.043
Is this relevant
to our present mission?

18:05.252 --> 18:06.503
It's relevant to me.

18:08.589 --> 18:11.717
This ancestor of yours is fifteen generations removed.

18:11.717 --> 18:15.262
You only possess a small fraction of her genetic material. Insignificant.

18:15.679 --> 18:19.224
This isn't about chromosomes, Seven, it's about character.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.144
Explain.

18:24.229 --> 18:26.940
Shannon O'Donnell inspired me when I was a girl.

18:27.983 --> 18:34.239
She had a, an influence on my imagination, on my goals.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.993
I never realised genealogy could have such an impact.

18:39.661 --> 18:42.581
I wouldn't have become a Starfleet Captain if it wasn't for her.

18:44.875 --> 18:47.169
- The temple of Artemis at Ephesus.
- That's four.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.254
- The Colossus at Rhodes.
- No. In chronological order.

18:49.254 --> 18:50.088
Right.

18:50.088 --> 18:55.302
The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. The Colossus at Rhodes.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.553
That leaves just one more.

18:56.762 --> 18:59.890
The seventh wonder of the ancient world is.

19:02.392 --> 19:03.227
Can't remember?

19:03.227 --> 19:06.146
It's right on the tip of my tongue.

19:08.649 --> 19:09.900
Forget it, I give up.

19:10.108 --> 19:15.948
- I got you. It's the,
- Can't remember?

19:16.156 --> 19:20.327
The Lighthouse of Alexandria built by Ptolemy the Second in 280 BC.

19:20.744 --> 19:24.498
Behold the wonder of the modern world. Borg photographic memory.

19:24.915 --> 19:26.375
We'll call this one a draw.

19:28.669 --> 19:29.920
Brushing up on Earth's history?

19:30.754 --> 19:33.882
Captain Janeway requested that I research one of her ancestors.

19:34.091 --> 19:36.802
- Shannon O'Donnell.
- You've heard of her.

19:37.219 --> 19:40.264
Who hasn't?
You mind if I lend a hand?

19:40.764 --> 19:41.598
If you wish.

19:45.352 --> 19:48.063
Sven 'Buttercup' Hanson.

19:48.689 --> 19:52.442
He was one of my progenitors. A twenty second century prize-fighter.

19:52.860 --> 19:55.779
The Captain encouraged me to investigate my genealogy as well.

19:56.405 --> 19:58.490
Well, your ancestors can tell you a lot about yourself.

19:59.324 --> 20:02.244
Somehow, I doubt 'Buttercup' has much relevance to me.

20:02.661 --> 20:07.666
The connection could be deeper than you think. Sven. Seven.

20:08.292 --> 20:09.543
A coincidence.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.254
The point is, there's some of him in you.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.756
Just as there'll be some of you in your descendants.

20:14.965 --> 20:16.633
If I choose to procreate.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.136
Well, I wouldn't dismiss it so lightly.

20:19.970 --> 20:24.349
Someday you may enjoy a little Seven of Nine point five running around.

20:25.184 --> 20:26.226
Or not.
Or not.

20:27.269 --> 20:30.397
My research has failed. I have found no references to this individual.

20:31.231 --> 20:34.985
Well, genealogy's a lot like fishing. You've got to cast a wide net.

20:36.028 --> 20:39.781
Computer, expand record search for subject Shannon O'Donnell

20:39.781 --> 20:43.410
to include non-Federation databases,

20:43.410 --> 20:46.872
personal archives and photographic indexes as well.

20:46.872 --> 20:48.123
Reference found.

20:49.583 --> 20:50.626
Well, take a look at this.

20:51.877 --> 20:53.337
Shannon Janeway.

20:54.171 --> 20:56.465
Where in the world did you find this?

20:56.465 --> 20:58.967
- A Ferengi database.
- Ferengi?

20:59.176 --> 21:02.721
Eleven years ago, one of their historians collected massive amounts of data

21:02.721 --> 21:05.849
about the origin of space travel in the Federation.

21:06.058 --> 21:08.769
He wanted to market it as a nostalgic gift item.

21:08.769 --> 21:10.646
I would have been his first customer.

21:11.688 --> 21:13.357
It's a handsome family, Captain.

21:13.774 --> 21:19.196
These must be her sons and daughters.
Grandchildren. Great-grandchildren.

21:19.404 --> 21:22.533
I've also discovered journalistic accounts in the historical archives.

21:22.741 --> 21:25.661
Mostly articles concerning resistance to the Millennium Gate.

21:25.661 --> 21:27.538
The whole town was against her.

21:28.997 --> 21:32.543
Download this image for me, will you, Neelix? I'm going to frame it.

21:32.751 --> 21:33.585
Yes, Captain.

21:34.419 --> 21:38.173
The citizens of Canton, Ohio greeted Millennium Gate representatives

21:38.173 --> 21:39.842
with a small parade today.

21:40.050 --> 21:44.638
Canton is one of three alternate sites now being considered by Gate officials.

21:44.847 --> 21:47.558
Vowing not to bow to pressure, Henry Janeway,

21:47.558 --> 21:51.103
owner of Portage Creek's Alexandria Books,

21:51.103 --> 21:53.814
says he has no intention of closing down.

21:53.814 --> 21:56.108
Marci Collins, Channel Three News.

21:58.193 --> 22:00.070
Next stop, Mars.

22:01.113 --> 22:03.407
I used to be in media relations with NASA.

22:03.615 --> 22:05.701
As I recall, your class came up with that slogan.

22:06.326 --> 22:07.161
Do you mind?

22:12.374 --> 22:14.251
It's a shame you didn't make the cut.

22:15.294 --> 22:16.753
Not good enough, I guess.

22:17.588 --> 22:19.464
Do you still keep in touch with any of the others?

22:19.464 --> 22:19.882
No.

22:20.090 --> 22:22.384
I do. In fact, I made a few calls last night.

22:22.593 --> 22:24.887
Remember Lieutenant McMillan?

22:25.304 --> 22:26.346
How's she doing.

22:26.763 --> 22:30.100
Co-pilot on a joint mission with the Europeans scheduled for 03.

22:31.143 --> 22:32.811
Four months on the space station.

22:35.314 --> 22:37.399
Not bad for a girl with claustrophobia.

22:38.025 --> 22:41.570
She got over it. Sorry to hear about your last job.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.698
All this downsizing in aerospace.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.826
Engineers aren't given the respect they deserve.

22:48.452 --> 22:50.329
Who told you I lost my job?

22:50.537 --> 22:52.206
I made a few calls.

22:53.248 --> 22:57.002
You don't have to live like this, borrowing money,

22:57.419 --> 22:58.879
sleeping in your car.

22:58.879 --> 23:00.756
You've got no business checking up on me.

23:00.964 --> 23:06.178
Actually, I do. We run a history on all our candidates.

23:06.803 --> 23:09.097
Are you trying to make me some kind of an offer?

23:09.515 --> 23:12.017
We know you've been working closely with Henry Janeway.

23:12.434 --> 23:13.477
He'll listen to you.

23:17.022 --> 23:19.942
You want me to talk to him, get him to change his mind.

23:20.776 --> 23:23.070
- If you can.
- And in return?

23:23.278 --> 23:24.947
We'd give you a job.

23:25.572 --> 23:27.866
Make you a consulting engineer on the project.

23:28.492 --> 23:31.829
You certainly have the credentials.

23:32.663 --> 23:33.288
Well?

23:37.042 --> 23:38.085
I'll think about it.

23:38.710 --> 23:43.090
Think quickly. We can't wait another thousand years.

23:58.313 --> 24:01.024
Roger that,
and go ahead.

24:01.859 --> 24:09.783
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.

24:25.632 --> 24:27.509
- Morning.
- Morning.

24:27.926 --> 24:31.054
I didn't think you'd mind. You've got some really great games on this thing.

24:31.263 --> 24:33.974
Don't worry about it.
Have you tried Matrix of Doom?

24:33.974 --> 24:36.268
Oh, yeah. I got vaporised on level six.

24:36.476 --> 24:39.188
Try launching a flare before entering the steel fortress.

24:39.396 --> 24:42.316
Cool. Coffee?

24:42.524 --> 24:44.193
Please. Where is your father?

24:44.610 --> 24:47.321
Bloomington. All the suppliers in town are boycotting us

24:47.321 --> 24:49.198
so he went up there to place some orders.

24:49.198 --> 24:52.951
- He left you in charge?
- Alexandria books, may I help you?

24:53.160 --> 24:54.828
Sounds like you've got it down.

24:56.705 --> 24:59.833
I pay the bills too. Dad's not very good at accounting.

25:00.459 --> 25:02.544
- You have any kids?
- Nope.

25:03.378 --> 25:05.672
- Not a priority?
- I wouldn't say that.

25:06.298 --> 25:11.720
I just never got around to it. If you don't mind me asking, where's your mom?

25:12.971 --> 25:15.474
- She died.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

25:16.934 --> 25:20.062
I was really young.
I don't remember her much.

25:21.522 --> 25:24.858
Dad says none of the great heroes grew up in a nuclear family.

25:25.901 --> 25:30.697
Hercules, Achilles, Odysseus, they all grew up with single parents.

25:31.114 --> 25:34.243
You're in good company.
You like working here, Jason?

25:35.911 --> 25:36.537
It's okay.

25:37.996 --> 25:40.707
You know, I get the feeling you don't share your father's enthusiasm

25:40.707 --> 25:42.376
about preserving the past.

25:43.836 --> 25:48.632
I don't know. The Millennium Gate could be pretty cool.

25:50.092 --> 25:54.054
Did you ever see the first landing on the moon? One small step for man.

25:55.097 --> 25:56.765
They showed it in science class one time.

25:58.225 --> 26:01.144
I saw it on TV when I was eleven years old.

26:01.770 --> 26:04.064
Whole world watched it.

26:04.481 --> 26:05.315
Must have been great.

26:05.315 --> 26:12.823
Oh, it was. So, do you have any heroes?

26:13.448 --> 26:17.202
We are not living in a heroic age, that's what my dad says.

26:17.619 --> 26:19.288
Come on, there's got to be somebody.

26:21.582 --> 26:26.170
Dad. I mean, he's a pain sometimes, but he's pretty cool.

26:29.298 --> 26:34.511
Alexandria books, may I help you? That's all right.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.933
First call in three days and it's a wrong number.

26:49.526 --> 26:52.863
Glorious Hector, son of Priam, slips past the Greek front lines

26:52.863 --> 26:56.200
bringing much-needed supplies to the embattled city of Troy.

26:56.617 --> 26:59.119
Hey, Dad you're famous.

26:59.328 --> 27:01.413
Local business owner topples gate.

27:01.413 --> 27:04.124
Let it fall.
Any customers this morning?

27:04.333 --> 27:05.792
No one here but us galliforms.

27:05.792 --> 27:08.295
That's chickens for the non-scientists in the crowd.

27:08.295 --> 27:12.466
You two are dangerous together. Portage Creek will thank us one day.

27:12.466 --> 27:14.760
You don't sacrifice history for a shopping mall.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.220
It's a little more than that, Henry.

27:16.220 --> 27:17.471
I beg your pardon?

27:17.679 --> 27:19.139
I said, it's not just a mall.

27:19.139 --> 27:21.642
Have you read the promotional literature?

27:21.850 --> 27:27.064
Over six hundred retail spaces available. Franchise potential.

27:27.064 --> 27:29.775
There's a commercial dimension to the project, but that's not its only function.

27:29.775 --> 27:30.817
What's your point?

27:31.235 --> 27:33.946
I've learned a few details about the Millennium Gate.

27:35.197 --> 27:38.951
It's a self-sustaining city, an experimental biosphere.

27:38.951 --> 27:40.202
It's never been done before.

27:40.619 --> 27:42.496
What's wrong with the biosphere we're living in now?

27:42.496 --> 27:43.539
- Nothing.
- Exactly.

27:43.747 --> 27:47.292
But this project will help scientists learn more about our environment.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.586
Possibly even recreate it on other worlds.

27:49.586 --> 27:52.714
Other worlds? Don't we have enough problems on the one we're on?

27:52.923 --> 27:55.843
Yeah. Which is why I'd like to get the hell off it one day.

27:56.051 --> 27:58.345
I think you're taking this exploring a little too far.

27:58.971 --> 28:02.099
And you're so afraid of change you can barely walk out that front door.

28:04.810 --> 28:07.521
The Millennium Gate has a lot of potential, Henry, you just can't see it.

28:07.521 --> 28:10.649
All you can see are these books. You're living in the past!

28:11.275 --> 28:13.777
Sounds like you've been sleeping with the enemy.

28:15.028 --> 28:16.697
Having a beer, anyway.

28:18.365 --> 28:19.199
Moss.

28:20.033 --> 28:22.119
- He offered me a job.
- Doing what?

28:22.327 --> 28:25.038
- Consulting engineer.
- On the Millennium Gate.

28:25.247 --> 28:26.707
I said I'd think about it.

28:26.707 --> 28:29.626
And he said, get Janeway to sign on the dotted line and you're hired?

28:30.252 --> 28:31.920
That's one way of looking at it.

28:32.129 --> 28:34.423
And when I say no, then what?

28:34.423 --> 28:35.883
You're going to go with them, right?

28:35.883 --> 28:38.594
To Canton, Ohio, or the Third Circle of Hell,

28:38.594 --> 28:41.513
or wherever it is they decide to build this damn thing!

28:41.513 --> 28:43.390
I can't keep living out of my car.

28:43.390 --> 28:45.475
You don't have to. Stay here.

28:45.684 --> 28:46.935
- No.
- Why not?

28:46.935 --> 28:48.812
- Because I can't.
- That's not a reason.

28:48.812 --> 28:50.272
Because I don't want to!

28:52.566 --> 28:55.485
You've been really nice to me, Henry, but I can't get stuck here.

28:55.903 --> 28:58.614
Stuck?
Like me.

28:58.614 --> 29:01.533
I didn't say that.
You can live however you want to.

29:01.533 --> 29:02.784
And so can you.

29:07.581 --> 29:08.624
What's going on?

29:09.041 --> 29:11.126
We're helping our guest resume her journey.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.420
But I thought you were staying here for a while.

29:13.420 --> 29:14.254
Something came up.

29:14.254 --> 29:15.506
We can manage by ourselves.

29:15.506 --> 29:18.008
I guess saying goodbye isn't that difficult after all.

29:29.269 --> 29:33.440
Jason. Jason, where you going?

29:34.066 --> 29:36.568
Aunt Pat's.
Happy New Year.

29:45.118 --> 29:49.498
Jason?
Jason!

29:58.048 --> 29:59.716
It was around 2210.

29:59.925 --> 30:03.053
My uncle Jack was on a deep space mission to Beta Capricus.

30:03.053 --> 30:05.764
That's when deep space meant the next star over.

30:05.973 --> 30:08.475
And that was when they still had to go into stasis.

30:08.684 --> 30:11.603
So Jack put his crew under as soon as they left orbit

30:11.603 --> 30:14.731
and piloted the ship by himself for six months.

30:15.148 --> 30:17.234
No contact with anybody along the way?

30:17.442 --> 30:19.736
There wasn't anybody along the way, not back then.

30:20.153 --> 30:21.613
The transmitter wasn't even subspace.

30:21.822 --> 30:23.699
It took weeks to get a message back to Earth.

30:23.907 --> 30:25.784
- I would prefer stasis.
- Me too.

30:25.784 --> 30:27.870
That long alone, I'd probably go a little batty.

30:27.870 --> 30:30.998
So, six months to Beta Capricus

30:30.998 --> 30:34.334
and when they finally arrive, there's nothing there.

30:35.377 --> 30:38.505
- No planets?
- No. No star, no nothing.

30:38.714 --> 30:43.510
It turns out Beta Capricus was just an e. m. echo of a distant galaxy.

30:43.719 --> 30:44.761
What was his course of action?

30:45.179 --> 30:46.430
What else could he do?

30:46.430 --> 30:48.390
He turned the ship around and headed home.

30:48.390 --> 30:49.141
And the crew?

30:49.349 --> 30:51.226
He figured there was no reason to bother them.

30:51.435 --> 30:54.146
There's nothing to see, nothing to do,

30:54.146 --> 30:59.359
so six months later he gets back to Earth, brings everybody out of stasis,

30:59.776 --> 31:01.862
and they wake up wondering why they haven't left orbit.

31:04.156 --> 31:04.781
Come in.

31:06.241 --> 31:09.161
Oh. I didn't realise you were in a briefig.

31:09.369 --> 31:11.872
Not at all. We're talking about our family histories.

31:13.123 --> 31:16.043
This can wait.
May I join you?

31:16.251 --> 31:17.294
Please.

31:17.920 --> 31:20.422
I, too, come from a distinguished line.

31:20.839 --> 31:22.508
His cousin's an electric shaver.

31:23.550 --> 31:24.176
Hardly.

31:24.801 --> 31:28.972
My program was compiled from the most advanced holo-matrices in the Federation.

31:29.181 --> 31:32.309
My cousin was a prize-winning chess program.

31:32.935 --> 31:36.063
Ensign Paris, you have yet to elaborate on your family origins.

31:36.897 --> 31:41.276
Well, they were a pretty ordinary bunch, salt-of-the-earth type people.

31:41.902 --> 31:46.698
Farmers, mostly, some planetary colonists. Ah, but there was one.

31:47.115 --> 31:48.784
He was a pilot.

31:48.992 --> 31:52.746
He flew the first orbital glider over the lower Martian plateau.

31:52.955 --> 31:56.291
Mars? Your ancestor must have known the Captain's!

31:56.500 --> 31:59.002
She did work on all the early Mars projects.

31:59.628 --> 32:01.505
Looks like we go way back, Mister Paris.

32:01.922 --> 32:04.216
- What was her name?
- Shannon O'Donnell.

32:05.050 --> 32:09.847
O'Donnell.
I don't think so.

32:10.889 --> 32:11.932
What do you mean?

32:12.349 --> 32:15.686
Well, I know all the Mars projects from the 1970s on,

32:15.686 --> 32:17.771
unmanned, manned, who's who.

32:18.814 --> 32:20.482
There were no O'Donnells in any of them.

32:30.909 --> 32:31.743
Come in.

32:32.786 --> 32:33.829
Ship's status report.

32:34.454 --> 32:36.123
Let me guess.

32:36.331 --> 32:39.459
The holographic engineer is having problems with her program.

32:39.459 --> 32:42.171
Neelix, the Cardassian cook, is low on supplies.

32:42.588 --> 32:46.967
Seven of Twelve is regenerating and Captain Chakotay is doing just fine.

32:47.384 --> 32:51.555
Just wondering how they'll piece together our lives a few hundred years from now.

32:51.972 --> 32:53.640
Depends on how big the pieces are.

32:53.849 --> 32:57.603
A PADD here, a Captain's log there, maybe a couple of holodeck programs.

32:57.603 --> 33:00.314
It won't be as much to go on as we might think.

33:01.148 --> 33:04.484
I've gone through dozens of histories written about twenty first century Earth,

33:04.484 --> 33:07.404
all of them biased in one way or another.

33:07.613 --> 33:11.992
The Vulcans describe First Contact with a savagely illogical race.

33:12.201 --> 33:15.329
Ferengi talk about Wall Street as if it were holy ground.

33:15.537 --> 33:19.082
The Bolians express dismay at the low quality of human plumbing.

33:20.125 --> 33:23.045
And human historians?
Exact same story.

33:23.462 --> 33:27.007
Every culture saw it a different way.
So I go back to the raw material.

33:27.424 --> 33:30.761
Birth certificates, death certificates, marriage certificates, census surveys,

33:30.761 --> 33:36.183
voter registration forms, housing records, medical, employment, court records.

33:36.391 --> 33:38.268
It's all fragmented and incomplete.

33:38.477 --> 33:40.979
So, did she exist?

33:42.022 --> 33:43.690
Her name was Shannon O'Donnell.

33:44.733 --> 33:49.112
She did train to be an astronaut but she didn't finish.

33:49.530 --> 33:53.492
She was an engineer but never worked on the Mars missions.

33:54.117 --> 33:55.786
Did she work on the Millennium Gate?

33:57.246 --> 33:58.497
Only as a consultant.

33:59.122 --> 34:01.208
What about all the opposition you spoke of?

34:01.416 --> 34:03.502
You said she fought to get the project underway.

34:04.336 --> 34:06.004
There was no opposition.

34:06.839 --> 34:10.801
In fact, the Millennium Gate was greeted with open arms by the local population.

34:12.261 --> 34:14.763
Except for one man.

34:15.597 --> 34:16.639
Henry Janeway.

34:17.266 --> 34:19.976
She married him
and changed her name,

34:19.976 --> 34:22.896
but she certainly
never changed history.

34:23.522 --> 34:24.773
Don't be too hard on her.

34:25.190 --> 34:28.318
She may not have known she was supposed to live up to your expectations.

34:28.735 --> 34:29.987
Oh, I'll get over it.

34:30.195 --> 34:32.697
But the question is, when we get back to Earth,

34:33.532 --> 34:35.409
how will I break the news to Aunt Martha?

34:37.911 --> 34:39.996
With less than three hours to go,

34:39.996 --> 34:42.291
Henry Janeway still refuses to cooperate

34:42.291 --> 34:44.168
with Millennium Gate representatives.

34:44.585 --> 34:46.879
I'll return with live updates as midnight approaches.

34:47.295 --> 34:49.172
Marci Collins,
Channel Three News.

34:52.509 --> 34:54.803
I don't suppose there's any chance he'll change his mind.

34:54.803 --> 34:56.889
By midnight?
Doubtful.

34:57.097 --> 34:58.974
Then it looks like we'll have to scrub the launch,

34:58.974 --> 35:01.059
at least where Portage Creek is concerned.

35:01.685 --> 35:04.813
It's a shame how one ignorant man can stand in the way of progress.

35:05.022 --> 35:06.273
It's not that simple.

35:06.481 --> 35:10.444
Henry's a very likable guy but he's playing for the wrong team.

35:10.652 --> 35:13.989
He's looking back. This town needs people who look towards the future.

35:14.406 --> 35:17.117
Well, while you're looking forward, I'll be driving to Florida.

35:17.743 --> 35:22.122
Wait a minute. I'm not about to turn a fellow explorer out into the cold.

35:22.331 --> 35:24.208
I didn't hold up my end of the bargain.

35:24.833 --> 35:27.336
If we didn't think you had something to add to this project

35:27.336 --> 35:29.630
we never would have made the offer in the first place.

35:30.255 --> 35:32.966
Henry Janeway's pigheadedness doesn't change that.

35:34.009 --> 35:39.640
We could still use your help, just not here. My associate in Canton.

35:40.057 --> 35:43.393
I'll tell him you're on the way. He'll find a place for you.

35:43.393 --> 35:43.810
Shannon!

35:44.436 --> 35:46.104
What's the matter?

35:47.356 --> 35:48.190
It's Dad.

35:49.024 --> 35:50.275
See you in Ohio?

35:52.361 --> 35:54.446
He won't leave the shop. There's all these people outside.

35:54.446 --> 35:55.280
The police are there!

35:55.489 --> 35:57.157
Your father can take care of himself.

35:57.574 --> 35:59.660
Please, won't you talk to him? He'll listen to you.

35:59.660 --> 36:00.702
No, he doesn't, Jason.

36:01.954 --> 36:04.873
Where are you going? And what's this about I'll see you in Ohio?

36:05.082 --> 36:06.333
Ohio.
Florida.

36:06.542 --> 36:09.044
- What's wrong with this place?
- It didn't work out.

36:09.044 --> 36:11.338
- I thought you liked us.
- I do.

36:11.547 --> 36:14.258
- Then why are you leaving?
- I'm sorry.

36:19.471 --> 36:23.433
December 31, 2000.
Eleven fifteen p. m.

36:24.476 --> 36:26.353
I've got ninety five miles of Interstate

36:26.353 --> 36:29.481
before I have to decide whether I head east or south

36:29.481 --> 36:32.192
but those ninety five miles won't be uneventful.

36:33.443 --> 36:37.406
My guidebook tells me I'm not too far from Leonardo da Vinci's last supper,

36:37.823 --> 36:42.202
recreated entirely in corn.

36:48.041 --> 36:50.544
The last few days have been memorable, to say the least.

36:52.004 --> 36:56.800
I met Henry Janeway. Interesting man. Liked to talk.

36:57.843 --> 37:00.345
Unfortunately, he doesn't listen to anybody but himself.

37:01.388 --> 37:08.270
He gave me a place to stay though, and we had dinner, in Paris no less.

37:09.730 --> 37:16.403
He has a son. Good kid.
Bright, like his father.

37:38.091 --> 37:41.220
I personally don't regret a single day I've spent in this lovely town,

37:41.220 --> 37:44.556
and I want to thank you all for your encouragement and support.

37:44.556 --> 37:45.933
Would you consider extending your deadline?

37:45.933 --> 37:48.101
- Excuse me.
- I'm afraid that's not possible.

37:48.101 --> 37:50.604
We'd like to express our deepest regrets to the town of Portage Creek

37:50.604 --> 37:52.689
and on behalf of.
Excuse me.

37:52.898 --> 37:53.524
Get this.

37:56.235 --> 37:57.277
Let her through.

38:15.212 --> 38:17.714
- We're closed.
- It's me!

38:21.260 --> 38:22.928
I said, we're closed.

38:23.345 --> 38:27.307
That's not what the sign says.

38:30.644 --> 38:32.729
Damn it, Henry,
it's cold out here.

38:34.815 --> 38:38.152
- Who's with you?
- Nobody but us galliforms.

38:44.616 --> 38:47.744
Thought you'd be in Ohio by now.
Car break down again?

38:49.621 --> 38:51.707
- What the hell are you doing?
- Get your things. We're leaving.

38:51.707 --> 38:52.958
I'm not going anywhere.

38:54.209 --> 38:55.669
Do I have to drag you out the front door?

38:55.669 --> 38:57.129
- You can try.
- Henry.

38:57.129 --> 38:58.380
- I won't leave.
- It's over.

38:58.380 --> 39:00.048
Then I'll have to ask you to leave.

39:00.048 --> 39:01.508
Half the town is out there.
You're on the news.

39:01.508 --> 39:04.011
Maybe you'll go down in history.
You have made your point.

39:04.011 --> 39:08.182
Obviously, I haven't, because if I had you wouldn't ask me to sign my life away.

39:08.182 --> 39:09.433
Maybe if you'd looked up from your books once in a while

39:09.433 --> 39:10.893
you'd see what's in front of you.

39:10.893 --> 39:13.187
Oh, please, no more speeches about the future.

39:13.187 --> 39:15.272
As long as I don't have to hear you pontificate about the past.

39:15.272 --> 39:18.192
It's a deal. Glad we had this chat. Goodbye.

39:18.192 --> 39:21.111
- It's almost midnight, Henry.
- Exactly. I've won.

39:21.111 --> 39:21.945
What have you won?

39:21.945 --> 39:23.822
The right to hide behind these shelves for the rest of your life?

39:23.822 --> 39:24.865
It's worked so far.

39:24.865 --> 39:29.453
Well, it isn't working for your son, or this town, or me.

39:29.661 --> 39:31.538
Look, I know you've got a job to do.

39:31.538 --> 39:33.832
- This isn't about the job.
- Then why are you here?

39:35.709 --> 39:39.046
- It was the cookies.
- Cookies?

39:41.757 --> 39:45.093
I was on the Interstate.
I stopped for gas,

39:45.928 --> 39:49.473
and I bought a bag of chocolate chip cookies in a convenience store.

39:50.098 --> 39:51.141
It's a little ritual of mine.

39:51.141 --> 39:53.852
Whenever I get back on the highway I like to treat myself.

39:55.729 --> 40:02.820
I see. Well, what does this have to do with anything?

40:07.199 --> 40:10.536
They didn't taste good, Henry. It wasn't the same.

40:13.247 --> 40:17.626
I just kept thinking about you and how I wish you'd been there.

40:19.086 --> 40:23.257
Actually, I prefer oatmeal cookies.
I'm allergic to chocolate.

40:23.674 --> 40:25.133
Oh, you don't know what you're missing.

40:28.053 --> 40:29.721
It's been a long time

40:31.807 --> 40:35.143
but I'm starting to feel like maybe I found a place where

40:37.437 --> 40:41.191
I'd like to stick around for a while, with you and Jason.

40:42.025 --> 40:43.694
And we'd like to have you.

40:44.736 --> 40:47.447
But I can't work in a bookstore for the rest of my life.

40:47.447 --> 40:50.784
I've been given a second chance, Henry, and I can't lose that.

40:52.661 --> 40:55.789
I'm stuck in the future, you're stuck in the past,

40:55.789 --> 40:59.960
but maybe we could get unstuck in the present.

41:03.088 --> 41:07.885
I don't see how with, without sacrificing my.

41:07.885 --> 41:10.387
You know, Mister Moss offered me a job in Canton,

41:10.387 --> 41:12.681
even though I failed to keep up my end of the bargain.

41:12.890 --> 41:14.349
I guess he felt sorry for me.

41:16.018 --> 41:21.023
But I'm prepared to turn him down if you want me to stay with you.

41:27.696 --> 41:34.369
I suppose I could reopen my shop in that monstrosity you want to build.

41:36.872 --> 41:38.749
Well, I have a few connections.

41:39.583 --> 41:43.754
I could probably get you a nice remote location so nobody would bother you.

41:44.379 --> 41:46.882
Not much profit in that.

41:47.508 --> 41:49.384
You sure you won't drive away again?

41:50.844 --> 41:55.432
No, But if I do, we'll make the trip together.

41:57.935 --> 41:58.977
What time is it?

42:00.437 --> 42:01.688
A minute to midnight.

42:01.897 --> 42:03.982
Then we're not too late.

42:49.236 --> 42:51.530
Neelix to Captain Janeway.

42:55.492 --> 42:56.326
Yes?

42:56.743 --> 42:58.620
Captain, would you mind coming to the Mess hall?

42:59.246 --> 43:00.289
Is there a problem?

43:00.706 --> 43:05.085
No, no emergency, but I need to speak with you. A personal matter.

43:06.336 --> 43:07.379
Give me a minute.

43:11.967 --> 43:15.512
- Happy Ancestor's Eve!
- Happy Ancestor's Eve, Captain.

43:15.929 --> 43:19.683
What's all this?
- It's April 22, Ancestor's Eve.

43:19.892 --> 43:23.437
It's a holiday first established, well,

43:23.645 --> 43:26.148
today actually,
with the Captain's permission.

43:26.565 --> 43:27.608
Neelix.

43:28.442 --> 43:29.485
I think he's onto something, Captain.

43:29.693 --> 43:32.613
An evening of reflection in honour of those who came before.

43:32.613 --> 43:34.490
Here, here, Uncle Jack would approve.

43:34.490 --> 43:36.992
It got me out from under a warp conduit. I'm all for it.

43:36.992 --> 43:38.785
I appreciate what you're trying to do, but.

43:38.785 --> 43:40.954
Neelix, the gift.

43:41.163 --> 43:42.206
What gift?

43:44.708 --> 43:50.756
Shannon O'Donnell Janeway, circa 2050. We did a little more research.

43:51.381 --> 43:54.510
This photograph was taken in a small park near Portage Creek,

43:54.510 --> 43:58.055
thirty eight years after the dedication of the Millennium Gate.

43:59.515 --> 44:00.766
I thought it would look nice in your Ready room,

44:00.766 --> 44:02.643
on the shelf next to your desk.

44:03.060 --> 44:06.396
Thank you, But I'm not so sure she has a place there anymore.

44:06.605 --> 44:08.690
You are mistaken, Captain.

44:09.525 --> 44:13.278
Her life captured your imagination. Historical details are irrelevant.

44:13.695 --> 44:15.155
I concur with that analysis.

44:15.572 --> 44:18.283
If it weren't for O'Donnell, you never would have joined Starfleet.

44:18.492 --> 44:21.829
Yeah, and I would have never have got you all stuck here in the Delta quadrant.

44:21.829 --> 44:23.288
It gave us all time to get to know each other.

44:23.914 --> 44:25.791
Time for a family portrait of our own.

44:28.085 --> 44:31.839
Everyone, gather around the Captain please.
