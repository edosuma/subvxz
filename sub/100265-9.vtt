WEBVTT

00:35.660 --> 00:37.871
What do you think
the boy has done with them?

00:39.706 --> 00:41.791
I'm not sure the boy's in charge anymore.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.023
What is he doing?

01:05.190 --> 01:06.274
I don't know.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.237
That ship's broken.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.323
You can't fly it.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.953
Where are you trying to go?

01:21.956 --> 01:23.750
Help. Friend.

01:23.833 --> 01:26.252
I want to help him too,
but we can't right now.

01:26.878 --> 01:29.214
You have to take the <i>Resolute</i>
to Alpha Centauri

01:29.297 --> 01:30.548
like I told them you would.

01:30.632 --> 01:35.095
No. Help. Friend.
Will Robinson.

01:38.723 --> 01:39.557
You're right.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.310
He is different.

01:42.393 --> 01:44.521
-No, Will. I didn't mean it like that.
-No.

01:44.938 --> 01:48.900
All this time, I've been trying to pretend
he's still the same...

01:50.318 --> 01:51.653
-but he's not.
-Will.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.822
And maybe that's okay.

01:56.741 --> 01:58.827
I'm not the same
as when we met up in that tree.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.204
Why should he be any different?

02:03.498 --> 02:04.499
We're connected.

02:06.835 --> 02:07.836
We're growing up.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.716
Someone's coming. What do we do?

02:17.428 --> 02:18.388
We have to hide them.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.348
Hide them? We can't hide two giant robots.

02:20.431 --> 02:23.643
Where are we gonna fit two giant robots?
And I have an idea.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.522
-They're here somewhere. We'll find them.
-And when you do,

02:27.605 --> 02:30.275
I don't want any more talk
of hearts or emotions.

02:30.358 --> 02:32.110
Just spike him. Clear him.

02:32.193 --> 02:33.570
The way you did Scarecrow.

02:33.862 --> 02:37.198
Everything else that machine wants
or feels will just...

02:37.657 --> 02:38.908
just drift away.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.368
What about the Robinsons?

02:40.493 --> 02:41.578
They're protective of it.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.079
They won't go down without a fight.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.831
But they will go down.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.291
Sir?

02:47.375 --> 02:49.627
What will history say
about what we've accomplished, Ben?

02:50.378 --> 02:52.046
Twenty-three successful missions

02:52.130 --> 02:54.674
and all they'll write about is the 24th.

02:55.925 --> 02:58.094
No one is ever remembered
for their accomplishments,

02:58.845 --> 02:59.846
only their failures.

02:59.929 --> 03:03.057
-We haven't failed. We can--
-The Robinsons have seized control

03:03.141 --> 03:04.517
of the narrative,

03:05.852 --> 03:08.188
and when we get to Alpha Centauri,

03:09.355 --> 03:12.817
when our families...
are told the story of what happened here,

03:12.901 --> 03:14.819
how do you think our roles will be cast?

03:17.906 --> 03:19.365
So what do you suggest we do?

03:20.742 --> 03:21.826
Rewrite the story.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.756
<i>Hey, are you back yet?</i>

03:35.048 --> 03:35.882
Hey.

03:36.341 --> 03:39.010
<i>Well, it turns out when I grabbed this pod</i>
<i>it was already low on fuel</i>

03:39.093 --> 03:40.637
so I'm taking it slow.

03:41.554 --> 03:42.931
Conserving power.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.558
It's actually quite beautiful out here.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.603
Well, we shouldn't stick around
any longer than we have to.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.564
So, how long do we have to?

03:51.648 --> 03:53.942
Well, if I continue through the ammonium
at this speed

03:54.025 --> 03:55.777
the water should be clean...

03:56.361 --> 03:58.655
by the time we finish our first orbit.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.949
On Earth that's 92 minutes.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.409
A planet this size, that's what? An hour?

04:03.493 --> 04:04.452
<i>Give or take.</i>

04:04.911 --> 04:07.747
Then we pick up the survivors and,
with the robot's help,

04:08.665 --> 04:10.792
be on our way to Alpha Centauri.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.418
<i>At last.</i>

04:12.502 --> 04:14.712
I can't even believe we pulled this off.

04:16.297 --> 04:17.465
I believe we got lucky.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.259
Today could have been a lot worse.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.514
<i>Fuel cell critically low.</i>

04:26.057 --> 04:28.935
Eh, looks like I'm finally out of juice.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.104
Okay, sit tight.

04:31.479 --> 04:33.856
<i>I'll grab one of these pods</i>
<i>and tow you back in.</i>

04:44.450 --> 04:47.620
<i>This serves</i>
<i>to report a code violation</i>

04:47.704 --> 04:50.373
<i>among the population of Colonist Group 24.</i>

04:51.416 --> 04:53.543
<i>Maureen Robinson,</i>

04:53.626 --> 04:57.338
<i>in a moment of panic</i>
<i>and uncertainty of purpose,</i>

04:58.006 --> 05:02.302
<i>attempted to take control of the </i>Resolute.

05:06.764 --> 05:12.186
<i>But when she realized</i>
<i>the error of her ways...</i>

05:14.897 --> 05:16.733
<i>...Maureen and her husband,</i>

05:16.816 --> 05:18.109
<i>-John Robinson...</i>
-Hi.

05:18.776 --> 05:21.237
-Hey.
-<i>...attempted to repair the damage...</i>

05:21.321 --> 05:23.323
-I gotcha.
<i>-...they had caused.</i>

05:26.034 --> 05:26.868
<i>However...</i>

05:28.161 --> 05:29.912
<i>in this course of action,</i>

05:31.080 --> 05:36.336
<i>their maintenance pods were lost</i>
<i>to the perils of space.</i>

05:40.631 --> 05:41.466
What the hell?

05:42.216 --> 05:43.343
What's wrong?

05:43.426 --> 05:45.970
- <i>Access denied.</i>
-The codes are jammed.

05:46.929 --> 05:48.473
<i>Rescue attempts were made.</i>

05:48.931 --> 05:50.808
I'm gonna try and do this manually.

05:50.892 --> 05:51.726
Hang on.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.147
Come on.

05:56.230 --> 05:57.940
<i>Those attempts</i>
<i>were unsuccessful.</i>

06:00.234 --> 06:01.235
Come on.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.741
<i>John, stop.</i>

06:06.824 --> 06:08.576
Stop. It's not going to work.

06:09.702 --> 06:10.536
Why not?

06:11.704 --> 06:13.539
It's Hastings. He locked us out.

06:21.297 --> 06:22.799
Hastings to bridge.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.759
Accelerated orbit, please.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.470
The faster we clean the water,

06:27.553 --> 06:30.807
the faster we can pick up
the other survivors and get on our way.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.352
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>Stand by for operational control.</i>

06:42.985 --> 06:44.362
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:46.948 --> 06:47.949
God!

06:49.784 --> 06:51.577
-No!

07:04.340 --> 07:06.259
Come on! Come on!

07:07.927 --> 07:09.595
Ahh, dammit!

07:15.810 --> 07:16.727
Judy, come in!

07:17.520 --> 07:19.605
Uh, hey, Mom, is everything okay?

07:19.689 --> 07:20.648
<i>Judy, listen to me.</i>

07:20.731 --> 07:22.150
Your dad and I are stranded.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.777
-What?
<i>-Don't talk, just listen.</i>

07:24.861 --> 07:26.863
<i>We are in two maintenance pods.</i>

07:26.946 --> 07:28.906
<i>We're drifting from the </i>Resolute

07:28.990 --> 07:31.659
at a separating speed
of  40 arc minutes per second.

07:31.742 --> 07:34.412
At that speed there's no way
we can possibly catch you,

07:34.495 --> 07:36.831
but the <i>Resolute </i>has to finish its orbit

07:36.914 --> 07:39.750
<i>around the planet before it can</i>
<i>exit the atmosphere, so...</i>

07:41.711 --> 07:44.380
...to turn around and meet you there.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.216
Uh, You're--
You're breaking up, Mom. I'm losing you.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.468
Hey, Jude.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.888
<i>Judy, listen to me.</i>
<i>We're almost out of range.</i>

07:52.388 --> 07:54.432
Find your brother and sister.
Fill them in.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.434
Tell them to stay away
from Hastings, okay?

07:56.517 --> 07:57.393
<i> Dad?</i>

07:57.477 --> 07:58.311
Jude?

07:59.937 --> 08:00.897
Jude?

08:04.233 --> 08:05.193
Dad!

08:06.736 --> 08:07.737
Is something wrong?

08:08.738 --> 08:09.739
Of course there is.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.366
-I don't even know why I ask anymore.
-Will? Uh, Penny?

08:13.075 --> 08:14.076
Where are you guys?

08:18.456 --> 08:19.290
Okay.

08:22.543 --> 08:23.669
There.

08:24.253 --> 08:25.755
Now no one can track us by our radios.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.840
We also have no way to contact anyone.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.551
Not Judy or Mom and Dad.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.054
But we can contact them another way.

08:33.137 --> 08:34.847
We need to hide right now.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.641
We're, like, fugitives.

08:36.724 --> 08:38.226
We're not fugitives.

08:38.768 --> 08:39.769
We're helping our friend.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.938
Will, we're hiding in trash
so we don't get arrested.

08:42.021 --> 08:44.023
It doesn't really get more fugitive-y
than that.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.193
Okay, Robot,

08:48.361 --> 08:51.239
if we're going to help Scarecrow,
you need to tell us how.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.657
Where are we supposed to go?

09:08.464 --> 09:09.674
These symbols...

09:10.466 --> 09:11.801
I've seen these before.

09:12.009 --> 09:12.843
Yeah.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.303
On the water planet.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.180
The pictures Mom took in the trench.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.891
They match. So...

09:19.809 --> 09:23.271
we need to take Scarecrow
to the water planet?

09:26.315 --> 09:27.358
Or not.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.365
All his markings are different.

09:35.449 --> 09:36.659
I don't understand.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.210
Oh, Pictionary, okay.

09:46.335 --> 09:48.337
It's a table. It's a tractor.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.589
It's a throne.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.257
It's a ski jump.

09:51.340 --> 09:52.341
It's a horse.

09:54.343 --> 09:55.344
Oh, it is a horse.

09:56.012 --> 09:59.223
But what does a horse have anything
to do with saving the, um...

10:00.308 --> 10:02.935
No. No. No.

10:03.019 --> 10:06.022
I don't care how sick this thing is, Will,
I'm not feeding it a horse.

10:06.856 --> 10:07.857
The Amber Planet.

10:09.358 --> 10:10.610
You want us

10:11.402 --> 10:12.820
to take Scarecrow

10:13.654 --> 10:15.906
to the ring on the Amber Planet.

10:17.158 --> 10:17.992
Yeah!

10:20.995 --> 10:22.913
<i>Attention colonists:</i>

10:22.997 --> 10:24.457
<i>this is Ben Adler,</i>

10:24.540 --> 10:27.084
<i>Director of Advanced Systems</i>
<i>onboard the </i>Resolute.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.587
This message is to alert you
to the actions

10:29.670 --> 10:31.631
of one of your fellow colonists,

10:31.714 --> 10:33.299
Will Robinson.

10:33.382 --> 10:37.595
<i>We have video evidence of him removing</i>
<i>from the engine room a piece of equipment</i>

10:37.678 --> 10:41.140
<i>that is vital to the completion</i>
<i>of our journey to Alpha Centauri.</i>

10:42.391 --> 10:46.354
<i>This action was taken without</i>
<i>the regard of the future safety of you</i>

10:46.437 --> 10:47.730
<i>or your loved ones.</i>

10:49.398 --> 10:50.566
With that in mind,

10:51.359 --> 10:52.568
we request

10:53.277 --> 10:56.030
that if you see him
or the robot he controls,

10:56.113 --> 10:59.950
you report their whereabouts
to security personnel immediately.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.997
And Will, if you can hear me...

11:06.874 --> 11:08.626
<i>I know you think</i>
<i>you're doing the right thing,</i>

11:08.709 --> 11:10.836
<i>but there are other ways to handle this.</i>

11:12.129 --> 11:14.799
Don't let this go any further than
it already has.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.513
Okay. What now?

11:31.148 --> 11:33.317
When starting a game of cat and mouse...

11:35.945 --> 11:38.072
you better make damn sure you're the cat.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.198
Can I help you?

11:39.323 --> 11:41.575
No, but I can help you.

11:42.159 --> 11:44.995
You want to catch a Robinson,
you need to think like a Robinson.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.374
I lived with those people
for seven months.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.127
You want to know what makes them tick,

11:51.210 --> 11:52.712
you talk to me.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.755
<i>So how are we gonna get</i>
<i>to the planet?</i>

11:55.339 --> 11:57.758
I don't know. Fly down in a Jupiter?

11:58.175 --> 12:01.345
Yeah, that would be really great
if either of us knew how to fly a Jupiter.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.931
Okay, so we get help.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.516
<i>They're going to need help.</i>

12:05.599 --> 12:07.893
<i>There are things the Robinsons can't</i>
<i>or won't do,</i>

12:07.977 --> 12:11.063
so they rely on the expertise of others.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.107
Find Don West.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.734
Find the Watanabes.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.070
The kids will show up there
sooner or later.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.530
What about the parents?

12:19.822 --> 12:21.991
We still haven't been able to locate
John or Maureen.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.163
Focus on the kids.

12:29.915 --> 12:30.750
Sir,

12:31.500 --> 12:33.377
I'm sorry to interrupt.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.295
What is it?

12:34.378 --> 12:37.006
Victor Dhar's codes were used
to access the refuse system.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.299
Why does that matter?

12:39.049 --> 12:40.426
Victor Dhar's not on the <i>Resolute.</i>

12:41.302 --> 12:42.178
But his son is.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.430
Send a team to the compactor.

12:45.556 --> 12:46.557
Now.

12:51.395 --> 12:52.980
Penny, Will, do you guys copy?

12:53.814 --> 12:55.775
-Seriously guys, where are you?
- Judy!

12:56.776 --> 12:58.527
Um, hey-- Hey, Sam.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.154
I heard the announcement about...

13:00.237 --> 13:02.990
Uh, yeah, I'm sure it's just a big,
uh, misunderstanding.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.241
My mom says I'm--

13:05.451 --> 13:07.912
I'm not supposed to talk
to you guys anymore.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.497
Yeah, it's okay. I understand.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.248
The thing is,

13:11.332 --> 13:13.959
I don't always listen
like I'm supposed to.

13:15.419 --> 13:16.462
How can I help?

13:18.464 --> 13:21.342
-Penny! What the hell?
-Hi. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

13:21.425 --> 13:23.135
I've been calling you like crazy!

13:23.219 --> 13:25.012
Yeah, I know. I smashed our radios.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.973
Did you think maybe to call me
before you did that?

13:28.641 --> 13:31.602
Yes, but can I refer you back to the whole
smashing of the radios thing?

13:32.978 --> 13:35.397
Okay--  Where's Will?

13:43.572 --> 13:44.740
Hi, Judy.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.412
Yeah, we should probably talk.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.208
I don't understand.
How is getting to that ring

13:54.291 --> 13:55.543
going to help Scarecrow?

13:56.544 --> 13:57.586
I don't know.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.797
Maybe it's where he's from.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.340
Like his home?

14:02.091 --> 14:02.967
Yeah, I guess.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.386
You're willing to risk everything
on "I guess"?

14:05.469 --> 14:07.096
What else are we supposed to do?

14:08.264 --> 14:09.765
No, I'm sorry, no.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.393
-It's too dangerous.
-For who?

14:12.726 --> 14:14.353
For all of us.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.653
The robot's always done
whatever we've asked.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.865
No matter how dangerous,
he has been there.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.118
And he's never asked us for anything.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.744
Until now.

14:34.331 --> 14:35.875
We need to do this.

14:36.292 --> 14:39.253
We have to at least try, because...

14:43.382 --> 14:45.092
because that's what friends do...

14:47.428 --> 14:48.429
for each other.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.891
It can't just be a one-way street.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.025
What do we do?

15:01.317 --> 15:02.234
I have an idea.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.748
Anything?

16:12.179 --> 16:13.514
You'll be safe here.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.308
They'll be safe here.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.519
Thank you.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.064
Okay, what now?

16:22.982 --> 16:26.610
If Mom and Dad were here
they would tell us to do pros and cons,

16:26.777 --> 16:30.447
but I'm going to save us some time because
there's just too many cons with this one.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.741
-Judy...
-And because they're not here,

16:32.825 --> 16:33.826
whatever I say goes.

16:33.909 --> 16:34.994
-Judy.
-And I say that

16:35.077 --> 16:37.621
if we're gonna do this
we're gonna need one heck of a plan.

16:37.705 --> 16:38.580
Judy.

16:40.624 --> 16:41.458
Wait.

16:42.918 --> 16:44.211
What?

16:47.881 --> 16:51.051
Okay. I have a question, though.
You said that Mom and Dad weren't here.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.054
Where did they go?

16:58.559 --> 17:00.602
<i>It shouldn't be too much longer.</i>

17:01.353 --> 17:03.856
Hey, when we see the <i>Resolute</i>
turn off your lights.

17:04.648 --> 17:06.608
Probably better
if they don't know we're coming.

17:08.068 --> 17:08.902
Okay.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.489
So do you want to talk about it?

17:13.407 --> 17:14.366
About what?

17:15.325 --> 17:17.745
<i>The elephant in the maintenance pod.</i>

17:21.248 --> 17:25.002
About... what Hastings told you I did

17:25.085 --> 17:26.879
to get Will to qualify.

17:27.504 --> 17:29.173
There's nothing to talk about.

17:30.257 --> 17:31.842
But you think I made a mistake.

17:32.342 --> 17:33.635
<i>You don't make mistakes.</i>

17:34.511 --> 17:36.096
You made a judgment call.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.557
And you're questioning my judgment.

17:39.808 --> 17:40.768
Aren't you?

17:42.352 --> 17:44.188
I mean, look at where we are.

17:46.815 --> 17:49.276
Anyway, look,
it doesn't matter what I think.

17:50.694 --> 17:51.737
But, uh...

17:53.989 --> 17:55.240
Judy was there.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.117
<i>She heard it all.</i>

17:58.869 --> 18:00.329
What did she say?

18:00.913 --> 18:01.830
She didn't.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.375
I just thought you should know.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.508
Whoa. What the hell was that?

18:25.229 --> 18:26.146
Whoa!

18:26.438 --> 18:27.272
Oh, my God.

18:35.656 --> 18:36.657
Oh, my...

18:37.741 --> 18:38.575
What?

18:52.339 --> 18:54.174
-I can't stop!
-Hold on!

18:58.428 --> 18:59.263
<i>John!</i>

19:11.692 --> 19:12.526
John!

19:13.026 --> 19:14.403
Right behind you!

19:25.747 --> 19:26.999
-Damn!

19:29.293 --> 19:30.169
Hang on!

19:35.591 --> 19:37.050
<i>I can't stop!</i>

19:38.385 --> 19:40.637
<i>Warning, temperature critical.</i>

19:50.856 --> 19:51.690
Come on.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.151
Come on.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.572
Almost there.

20:00.365 --> 20:01.825
Gotcha!

20:03.285 --> 20:04.494
-Come on!

20:06.205 --> 20:07.372
Hang on!

20:17.507 --> 20:18.592
You all right?

20:19.218 --> 20:20.052
Yes.

20:20.844 --> 20:22.095
You?

20:22.179 --> 20:23.430
Yeah.

20:24.932 --> 20:25.974
Where are we?

20:28.477 --> 20:30.270
We're miles off course.

20:30.354 --> 20:33.565
Do you-- Do you have enough fuel
to get us back?

20:34.983 --> 20:37.402
<i>Warning, fuel level at twelve percent.</i>

20:38.278 --> 20:39.154
Yeah.

20:40.405 --> 20:41.531
Yeah, sure.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.450
<i>Yeah, we're gonna be fine.</i>

20:44.201 --> 20:45.077
Okay.

20:46.370 --> 20:49.122
Okay, so the way I see it,
if we're going to get Robot

20:49.206 --> 20:50.832
and Scarecrow down to the Amber Planet,

20:51.250 --> 20:53.293
-we're gonna need to hijack a Jupiter.
-No.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.295
Penny, we're not gonna hijack a Jupiter.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.589
You're right, sorry.
We're gonna need to steal a Jupiter.

20:57.673 --> 21:01.718
Borrow. The term is borrow,
as in we have to ask permission first.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.679
Okay, but who's crazy enough

21:03.762 --> 21:06.014
to let a bunch of kids
borrow their Jupiter?

21:07.641 --> 21:08.809
What time is it?

21:09.434 --> 21:10.477
12:03. Why?

21:11.353 --> 21:12.562
It's lunch time.

21:13.188 --> 21:15.649
All this going on and that's all
you can think about?

21:16.191 --> 21:19.403
Samantha, can you get me
to the dining hall?

21:19.945 --> 21:20.862
Sure thing.

21:32.874 --> 21:33.750
Hey.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.837
-Hey.

21:36.962 --> 21:39.089
We shared an intimate
near-death experience

21:39.172 --> 21:40.674
and all I get is a "hey"?

21:40.757 --> 21:41.717
Sorry.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.886
Your elbow has boldly gone
where no man has--

21:44.970 --> 21:47.514
-I have to go. I'm sorry.
-You haven't seen Penny, have you?

21:47.931 --> 21:48.765
Uh...

21:49.891 --> 21:50.976
No, not recently.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.769
That's too bad.

21:54.062 --> 21:55.355
You like her, don't you?

21:56.481 --> 21:57.816
No, we're just friends.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.860
What about your father?

22:00.944 --> 22:01.987
Does he like her?

22:03.071 --> 22:05.032
He doesn't really know her.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.283
Right,

22:07.034 --> 22:08.952
because he's still down on the planet,

22:09.286 --> 22:11.955
hasn't been quite able
to get back up here yet.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.332
He's probably lucky.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.917
It's not an easy trip to make.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.503
Those Jupiters can be so...

22:20.630 --> 22:22.090
...unpredictable.

22:23.800 --> 22:27.095
Fortunately for you, I happen to have
a lot of pull at the moment.

22:28.096 --> 22:31.058
I'm sure you've heard
what the Robinsons have done, so...

22:31.141 --> 22:33.226
maybe if you help us find them

22:33.310 --> 22:35.604
I can put in a good word for Daddy.

22:36.063 --> 22:39.316
Make sure he gets on one of the more,
you know, predictable flights.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.073
You okay?

22:47.032 --> 22:49.284
Looks like you lost your appetite.

22:49.951 --> 22:51.703
I think I'll just save it for later.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.330
It's probably best.

22:55.791 --> 22:56.875
Talk soon.

23:03.256 --> 23:04.758
Is he gonna be okay?

23:11.765 --> 23:14.351
My sisters are doing everything they can
to help us.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.615
What is that?

23:30.200 --> 23:31.868
Is that how he got hurt?

23:42.254 --> 23:43.088
No.

23:44.631 --> 23:46.091
We're not gonna let him die.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.402
Hey, don't look down, okay?

24:05.485 --> 24:07.863
What did I just say?
There's cameras everywhere.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.701
Just pull out your tablet
and pretend I'm not here.

24:21.168 --> 24:22.419
So is it, um...

24:23.545 --> 24:25.005
is it true what you guys did?

24:25.422 --> 24:26.298
No.

24:27.632 --> 24:30.760
Okay, yeah, actually, sort of,
but we had a really good reason,

24:30.844 --> 24:33.263
and I kinda don't have time
to explain that right now.

24:33.346 --> 24:34.639
So, I just need to ask your help.

24:36.016 --> 24:37.559
What kind of help?

24:37.642 --> 24:40.020
The kind where you let us borrow
your Jupiter.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.484
You borrow a pencil, Penny.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.027
You borrow, like, a sweater.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.154
You don't borrow
a 40-million-dollar spaceship.

24:56.536 --> 24:57.454
Hi.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.297
Vijay, it's a yes or no question.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.510
Well, who's going to be flying it?

25:12.761 --> 25:16.056
I don't know, um, Judy probably.
She has the most time on the simulator.

25:17.140 --> 25:18.892
This isn't a simulation, Penny.

25:18.975 --> 25:20.685
The stakes are real.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.604
Okay, for all of us.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.232
Okay, sorry. I just...

25:25.315 --> 25:29.528
Look, when I met you, you asked me
to go to the waterfall with you, right?

25:29.611 --> 25:30.820
So, I did,

25:30.904 --> 25:32.822
but I got in a lot of trouble, okay?

25:32.906 --> 25:35.242
And then you asked me
to get information on Dr. Smith

25:35.325 --> 25:37.452
and we both almost died floating in space.

25:38.411 --> 25:39.704
For some reason,

25:40.580 --> 25:42.499
whenever you ask me to do stuff,

25:43.500 --> 25:45.001
I can't say no.

25:47.420 --> 25:48.713
But this time...

25:49.339 --> 25:51.967
Look, this time
it's not just me that could get hurt.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.095
What are you talking about?

25:56.096 --> 25:58.598
They told me that if I helped you, then...

26:00.016 --> 26:02.310
Okay, look, Penny,
the point is my dad is still out there

26:02.394 --> 26:05.188
and I just really don't want to do
anything that could put him in danger.

26:06.856 --> 26:09.317
And I want to help, okay,
because we're friends

26:09.901 --> 26:12.737
and that's what friends do, but...

26:12.821 --> 26:14.406
But friendship isn't a one-way street.

26:14.948 --> 26:15.782
What?

26:16.199 --> 26:17.075
Nothing.

26:17.158 --> 26:19.578
Nothing, um, you're right and...

26:20.662 --> 26:21.663
I'm sorry,

26:21.746 --> 26:24.958
and I shouldn't ask you
to keep doing things for me

26:25.041 --> 26:26.918
because that's actually
not what friends do.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.754
I'm really sorry. I wish that I could.

26:29.838 --> 26:30.880
No, it's okay.

26:31.756 --> 26:33.883
It's okay. We're just gonna--
We'll find another way.

26:47.105 --> 26:49.107
What exactly did the Robinsons do

26:49.190 --> 26:51.401
that would make you
turn against them like this?

26:51.484 --> 26:55.196
If I were to diagnose this family I'd say
they have a rampant hero complex.

26:57.157 --> 26:59.618
Desperate need to be seen
as better than everyone,

27:00.118 --> 27:01.745
smarter, braver.

27:03.330 --> 27:05.248
So much so they'll even create
circumstances

27:05.332 --> 27:06.875
they'll have to rescue others from.

27:07.667 --> 27:09.753
I believe this makes them a danger,

27:09.836 --> 27:12.088
not only to themselves,
but to everyone around them.

27:12.172 --> 27:14.090
And you think
that's what's happening here?

27:14.924 --> 27:18.678
That they're manufacturing a situation
with the robot for their own benefit?

27:18.762 --> 27:20.555
That robot is the key
to everyone's survival.

27:21.264 --> 27:22.515
They've taken it.

27:23.266 --> 27:24.684
Why else would they do that?

27:26.978 --> 27:27.937
-Hey.
-Hey.

27:28.021 --> 27:29.773
Did Don have any idea
how to get us a Jupiter?

27:29.856 --> 27:31.858
Med bay's crawling with guards.
Couldn't get to him.

27:31.941 --> 27:33.318
It's like they knew we were coming.

27:33.401 --> 27:35.403
-Yeah, 'cause they did.
-What do you mean?

27:35.487 --> 27:37.405
-Smith is helping them.
-Of course she is.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.158
She knows us too well. They're always
gonna be one step ahead of us.

27:40.241 --> 27:43.286
That's why we have to do something that

27:43.787 --> 27:44.954
she's not expecting,

27:45.038 --> 27:47.624
something that we would never ever do.

27:48.291 --> 27:49.125
Like what?

27:49.793 --> 27:53.088
The Robinsons may be annoying,
but they're clever.

27:54.381 --> 27:55.924
They know we're onto them.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.844
So they're gonna try and outsmart us.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.347
How?

28:16.361 --> 28:17.445
Is it safe?

28:19.864 --> 28:22.283
- Safe. Will Robinson.
-Shhh.

28:29.916 --> 28:30.750
Okay.

28:33.586 --> 28:34.629
Okay.

28:35.463 --> 28:36.297
Hey.

28:37.006 --> 28:38.758
Don't worry. He's gonna be okay.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.302
This is a good plan.

28:45.014 --> 28:47.434
Do you think Mom's gonna be mad
when she finds out what we did?

28:47.517 --> 28:48.768
Oh, yeah, hundred percent.

28:48.852 --> 28:51.521
Well, Mom's not exactly the arbiter
of what's right and wrong anymore.

28:52.814 --> 28:53.982
What do you mean?

28:55.024 --> 28:56.568
Look, I just mean that, um...

28:58.737 --> 29:01.239
we're old enough to take responsibility
for our actions.

29:01.656 --> 29:04.576
Right, this is it.
You guys know what you have to do?

29:04.659 --> 29:05.744
Yes, I do.

29:18.923 --> 29:21.342
How long before we left Earth
did you get your implant?

29:25.305 --> 29:26.514
Why do you want to know?

29:26.598 --> 29:27.682
It's nothing.

29:28.099 --> 29:31.728
I just know a thing or two about scars,
and well, yours looked pretty fresh.

29:31.811 --> 29:35.690
For someone whose job it is to make sure
nothing happens to that robot,

29:36.274 --> 29:38.276
you seem to be spending a lot of time

29:39.486 --> 29:40.820
focused on me.

29:45.658 --> 29:47.076
It's interesting,

29:47.160 --> 29:49.788
you were on that planet with Maureen
and Will for quite a while.

29:51.748 --> 29:54.167
I can't help but wonder
if your priorities have shifted.

29:54.667 --> 29:57.545
That robot is the key to me
ever seeing my family again.

29:58.129 --> 29:59.798
Do not question my resolve!

29:59.881 --> 30:02.300
I might remind you that
Scarecrow is my project.

30:02.383 --> 30:04.177
It belongs to me, not you.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.263
Wouldn't be so sure about that.

30:09.224 --> 30:10.600
You're not the only one in the room

30:10.683 --> 30:12.477
that's had a relationship
with these machines.

30:14.604 --> 30:17.816
I myself was connected to the robot.

30:20.109 --> 30:21.194
He was my friend...

30:22.987 --> 30:24.197
not just Will's.

30:26.241 --> 30:27.158
You?

30:28.243 --> 30:30.078
You were able to connect with one of them?

30:30.161 --> 30:31.454
Of course.

30:32.789 --> 30:33.623
Wait.

30:34.833 --> 30:35.792
You weren't?

30:38.253 --> 30:40.380
You may know the robot,
but I know the boy.

30:40.797 --> 30:43.174
What makes you think you know him
better than I do?

30:43.258 --> 30:44.592
Oh, I know I do.

30:45.176 --> 30:46.094
Will and I...

30:47.554 --> 30:48.638
we're the same.

30:50.056 --> 30:52.642
Before I got tangled up in all this...

30:55.353 --> 30:56.604
I used to be him.

30:58.773 --> 30:59.691
The question is...

31:01.234 --> 31:02.402
who did you used to be?

31:11.452 --> 31:12.328
Gotcha!

31:23.756 --> 31:25.675
Hey, send your men into the subsystem.

31:25.758 --> 31:27.385
The Robinsons will be down there
somewhere.

31:31.598 --> 31:32.640
Huh, what the hell is that?

31:38.730 --> 31:40.440
Someone stop that chariot!

31:43.818 --> 31:45.653
I know no one saw
this coming, huh?

31:48.823 --> 31:49.908
Oh, there's people!

31:49.991 --> 31:51.826
Move, move, move, move, move!
Excuse me.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.828
Yeah, so this is seeming like
a less good idea.

31:56.372 --> 31:58.499
Is this hallway smaller
than it used to be?

31:59.125 --> 32:02.337
I think everything is smaller
when you're in a vehicle this size.

32:05.256 --> 32:08.676
-You, uh, need to thread the needle, Judy.
-I know, I know, I got it, I got it.

32:12.555 --> 32:15.475
Can someone tell me
what the hell is going on here?

32:15.558 --> 32:17.185
The Robinsons are making a run for it.

32:17.268 --> 32:21.272
We're in the middle of outer space.
Where the hell are they gonna run to?

32:33.993 --> 32:35.828
Judy, I really wish I'd peed first.

32:36.204 --> 32:37.038
What?

32:38.289 --> 32:40.416
Uh, Judy, the doors are closing.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.336
-We're not gonna make the turn.
-Relax, okay? It's physics.

32:43.419 --> 32:46.547
We head for the apex of the turn then
slow down before accelerating out of it.

32:46.631 --> 32:49.676
-No, we're not gonna make it. Turn!
-I got it, Penny! I got it!

32:56.724 --> 32:57.684
What happened?

32:58.685 --> 33:00.103
We didn't make the turn.

33:01.145 --> 33:03.314
What do we do now?

33:03.982 --> 33:06.192
- We stay calm.

33:06.275 --> 33:08.277
It's over now, girls.
Open the door.

33:09.737 --> 33:11.489
-No, don't, don't.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.576
- Hey.
- Open up.

33:15.660 --> 33:16.577
Hey.

33:16.661 --> 33:17.787
It's gonna be okay.

33:19.455 --> 33:22.625
Security team,
we have the Robinsons on site. Standby.

33:24.168 --> 33:25.003
Step out!

33:26.963 --> 33:30.717
- Let's go. Let's go.
-Sir, the scarecrow, it's here.

33:33.886 --> 33:35.930
Hey, look you don't have to do this.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.682
You leave me no choice.

33:48.443 --> 33:49.402
What?

33:50.028 --> 33:51.696
-It's just an arm, sir.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.282
It was a shell game.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.577
Where the hell are they?

33:57.660 --> 34:00.038
Alert all teams. All security teams.

34:03.958 --> 34:04.876
The plan worked.

34:04.959 --> 34:05.918
No guards.

34:13.176 --> 34:15.053
<i>Access granted.</i>

34:18.931 --> 34:19.807
Hello, Will.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.227
How'd you know we'd be here?

34:23.311 --> 34:25.188
Because it's where I would have gone.

34:25.688 --> 34:27.065
No place like home, right?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.027
This is Adler.

34:31.444 --> 34:32.361
I've got them.

34:32.779 --> 34:33.988
Jupiter 2.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.114
<i>Standby.</i>

34:35.198 --> 34:36.491
<i>-Personnel on its way.</i>
-Will...

34:38.367 --> 34:40.161
I need you to step away from the robot.

34:41.579 --> 34:42.455
No.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.044
No, both of you, stop.

34:48.127 --> 34:50.004
Stop, please!

34:50.088 --> 34:51.881
I don't know what
you think you're doing, Will,

34:51.964 --> 34:53.925
but I cannot let you take away
our only hope of survival.

34:54.008 --> 34:55.134
I'm not!

34:55.218 --> 34:57.178
-Then what are you doing?
-Can't you see?

34:57.762 --> 34:58.763
He's dying.

34:59.597 --> 35:00.973
You think you can save him?

35:01.057 --> 35:03.017
I've done it before.

35:04.477 --> 35:07.730
Look, the <i>Resolute </i>isn't even ready
to leave yet.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.941
By the time the rest of the colonists
are on board,

35:10.650 --> 35:11.818
we'll be back.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.029
You won't have to wait for us,

35:15.655 --> 35:18.950
-and we won't put anyone else in danger.
-Life never goes according to plan, Will.

35:19.325 --> 35:21.869
We both know that, all too well.

35:24.705 --> 35:27.458
You said you wished you and Scarecrow
could have been friends.

35:29.752 --> 35:31.587
Well, now's your chance to act like one.

35:32.630 --> 35:35.133
We have to think
beyond these machines, Will.

35:36.008 --> 35:38.344
We're talking about the survival
of the human race.

35:38.427 --> 35:39.554
What about their race?

35:39.637 --> 35:42.932
If you're asking me to choose between
the survival of your friend and my family,

35:43.432 --> 35:44.684
I choose my family...

35:46.686 --> 35:48.312
and I believe you'd do the same.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.400
I am truly sorry about this, Will.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.821
No! Stop, no!

35:56.904 --> 35:58.698
No! Robot!

36:00.408 --> 36:01.784
There's nowhere else to go.

36:03.035 --> 36:04.120
It ends here.

36:04.203 --> 36:05.371
No!

36:06.664 --> 36:07.957
No!

36:09.834 --> 36:10.751
Help.

36:11.627 --> 36:12.628
Family.

36:29.312 --> 36:31.522
Help. Ben Adler.

36:33.691 --> 36:35.318
Help, Ben Adler.

36:35.902 --> 36:38.404
Ben, get your EMF device.
Use it.

36:39.113 --> 36:40.031
Ben!

36:41.032 --> 36:42.992
Help, Ben Adler.

36:47.955 --> 36:49.248
Help me get him on board.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.268
Come on! Robot!

37:09.769 --> 37:11.896
No. Will Robinson.

37:12.939 --> 37:14.106
I'm not leaving you.

37:14.190 --> 37:16.484
You have to get up.
You have to fight back!

37:16.901 --> 37:18.527
If we're gonna go, we go now!

37:19.403 --> 37:22.740
Help. Friend.

37:47.390 --> 37:48.599
Should we go after them?

37:49.350 --> 37:50.268
No.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.396
We have everything we need.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.986
Captain Kamal, this is Hastings.

38:00.444 --> 38:01.779
We have enough water.

38:02.238 --> 38:03.322
It's time to leave.

38:14.834 --> 38:16.085
<i>John, look.</i>

38:16.168 --> 38:17.795
<i>Fuel level at one percent...</i>

38:17.878 --> 38:19.213
It's the Jupiter 2.

38:19.672 --> 38:21.215
<i>Where are they going?</i>

38:21.299 --> 38:24.135
-We haven't got enough fuel to find out.
-But what if there's--

38:24.218 --> 38:25.636
We can't be at two places at once.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.639
The intake valve is closing,
it's our only way back in.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.516
- <i>Fuel at minimum.</i>
<i>-</i> Hold on.

38:32.435 --> 38:35.688
<i>Power shutoff in T-minus ten seconds.</i>

38:39.233 --> 38:40.234
Almost...

38:40.776 --> 38:41.610
John.

38:43.279 --> 38:44.405
John!

38:45.031 --> 38:46.073
Almost...

38:47.491 --> 38:48.617
there!

39:18.272 --> 39:20.733
What do you think is gonna happen
to Robot?

39:21.567 --> 39:22.651
I don't know.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.488
Want to go back?

39:32.078 --> 39:32.995
No.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.209
We're taking Scarecrow to the ring.

39:45.841 --> 39:47.343
That's what Robot wanted.

39:53.057 --> 39:54.350
Robot is secured.

40:07.196 --> 40:08.739
Do we really have to do this?

40:12.827 --> 40:13.702
Proceed.
