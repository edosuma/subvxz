WEBVTT

00:02.060 --> 00:04.660
Go on, go and chat her up.

00:04.700 --> 00:07.259
Remember, you're a great lover.

00:07.260 --> 00:10.020
Your father was a great lover.

00:10.060 --> 00:13.260
He never said. How do you know?

00:13.300 --> 00:15.140
Can't wait to hear this bit.

00:15.180 --> 00:18.740
Well, all the ladies knew where he
had a mole.

00:20.420 --> 00:21.420
In the garden.

00:23.260 --> 00:26.700
No... Not the one in the garden,
no, the one on his...

00:28.540 --> 00:30.859
Gets better. It runs in the family.

00:30.860 --> 00:33.539
Uncle Willie, he had one.

00:33.540 --> 00:34.979
Well, there you are, you see.

00:34.980 --> 00:36.459
It's in your blood.

00:36.460 --> 00:40.380
Now, go and tell her that she makes
your heart swell.

00:40.420 --> 00:42.139
It's the elbow usually.

00:42.140 --> 00:44.379
Are you telling me I've got tennis
heart?

00:44.380 --> 00:47.820
No, no...
Look, quick, before she gets away.

00:47.860 --> 00:50.739
Go and tell her you like her hair.

00:50.740 --> 00:52.100
I like your elbow.

00:52.140 --> 00:54.300
Eurgh!

00:54.340 --> 00:56.740
She's not in a good mood.

00:56.780 --> 00:59.420
She's been hearing noises in the
night.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.700
There's something going off in that
house.

01:02.740 --> 01:04.899
Not as much as there could be

01:04.900 --> 01:09.579
if only you would open yourself up
to new experiences.

01:09.580 --> 01:12.380
Oh, come on, they're daft as
brushes.

01:16.180 --> 01:18.780
Where is this mole exactly?

01:18.820 --> 01:20.900
You heard, in his garden.

01:39.380 --> 01:40.620
Oh!

01:49.980 --> 01:52.180
TILL RINGS

01:54.060 --> 01:59.100
COINS CLATTER

02:08.900 --> 02:10.499
Ha!
HE CHUCKLES

02:10.500 --> 02:11.700
There you go.

02:15.580 --> 02:18.420
Good morning. No, it isn't.
No, it's not.

02:18.460 --> 02:20.339
We've just agreed that.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.860
Because a man needs a woman in his
life.

02:23.820 --> 02:25.540
I need one out of mine.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.380
Sorry.

02:28.420 --> 02:31.420
I know what you mean, so a
transfer's out of the question.

02:33.460 --> 02:36.179
Well, don't look at me. I'm not on
the transfer list.

02:36.180 --> 02:38.139
You know what the trouble is?

02:38.140 --> 02:40.579
We don't give the day a chance to
get started

02:40.580 --> 02:44.299
before we leap straight into it.
You leap straight into it?

02:44.300 --> 02:46.860
I've only seen you ever creep and
stagger.

02:47.940 --> 02:49.500
I deny being a creep.

02:50.740 --> 02:52.740
Ask anybody, except Mr Richardson,

02:52.780 --> 02:55.180
who caught me struggling with his
daughter.

02:57.860 --> 03:00.460
I was trying to escape.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.260
I know the feeling.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.740
She's a big girl.
I'm lucky to be alive.

03:05.780 --> 03:08.180
I hope you haven't lost us another
customer.

03:08.220 --> 03:11.220
You've got to learn to resist their
advances

03:11.260 --> 03:13.660
while keeping their weekly order.

03:13.700 --> 03:16.300
She only ever came in for
small items.

03:16.340 --> 03:20.140
Well, she got that bit right with
you, then.

03:20.180 --> 03:23.779
Does she know that we do delivery on
request?

03:23.780 --> 03:26.059
She was working on that assumption.

03:26.060 --> 03:27.900
I have to be up early.

03:27.940 --> 03:30.340
The dog won't lie in.

03:30.380 --> 03:32.340
Where did your father have a mole?

03:32.380 --> 03:34.580
Between his leeks and his potting
shed.

03:39.020 --> 03:41.499
I like being up at this time.

03:41.500 --> 03:45.779
When the world is fresh
and Mrs Featherstone free.

03:45.780 --> 03:47.939
It's my quality time.

03:47.940 --> 03:50.580
Well, you won't do better than that
good woman.

03:50.620 --> 03:51.860
HE SCOFFS

03:51.900 --> 03:54.660
Good woman. They don't call her the
Black Widow...

03:56.180 --> 03:59.139
I notice you keep backing off from
her.

03:59.140 --> 04:02.739
The dedicated grocer has to remain
celibate.

04:02.740 --> 04:07.500
We who handle people's perishables
have to be above suspicion.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.699
Thank you, Humphrey.

04:16.700 --> 04:18.540
You may return to your station.

04:21.540 --> 04:25.579
Someone's having fun.
He's more efficient than you are.

04:25.580 --> 04:28.180
He's my new advertising gimmick.

04:28.220 --> 04:31.419
You know, I can feel myself going
paler and paler.

04:31.420 --> 04:33.500
I look like an unfried chip.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.939
It's hard to be efficient because I
get no sun.

04:35.940 --> 04:38.459
It only overstimulate the hormones.

04:38.460 --> 04:41.780
They're notorious for it when
there's plenty of sun.

04:41.820 --> 04:44.259
A person needs a certain amount.

04:44.260 --> 04:45.860
That Mrs Mauritz,

04:45.900 --> 04:49.940
she avoided a nasty sunburn only by
being in the shade...

04:49.980 --> 04:51.500
of a Turkish waiter.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.660
I'm going to look like Dracula.

04:55.700 --> 04:57.540
Dracula, eh?

04:57.580 --> 05:01.420
Sinister but still the women found
him attractive.

05:03.860 --> 05:07.180
What if Gastric looked a bit more
sinister?

05:07.220 --> 05:10.460
Gastric looks more like a friendly
Labrador.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.499
He'd get more respect from Madge

05:12.500 --> 05:15.740
if he had a touch of the nasties
from Transylvania.

05:18.340 --> 05:19.620
You think about it.

05:19.660 --> 05:22.820
Eh, you need to think about how we
can get rid of these

05:22.860 --> 05:26.300
individual Christmas puddings you
bought out of season.

05:26.340 --> 05:29.140
I know... The price was right.

05:29.180 --> 05:31.620
WOMAN: Save me a small brown cob.

05:39.180 --> 05:40.500
You see what happens?

05:40.540 --> 05:43.819
You start talking about Dracula
and the next thing you know,

05:43.820 --> 05:47.460
a disembodied voice is
after your small brown cobs.

05:52.540 --> 05:55.540
10-1, that small brown cob of
Mrs Alsop...

05:55.580 --> 05:58.180
The invisible Mrs Alsop.

05:58.220 --> 06:01.700
First Dracula, now Mrs Alsop,
the invisible.

06:01.740 --> 06:03.900
I think you half believe this stuff.

06:03.940 --> 06:08.219
All I know is the mysterious,
the unexplainable,

06:08.220 --> 06:11.620
is often staring us in the face.

06:11.660 --> 06:14.220
I know that's what your VAT
inspector thinks.

06:19.940 --> 06:22.980
Out of season Christmas puddings?

06:23.020 --> 06:26.620
No, it's a sneak preview of next
season's Christmas puddings.

06:35.140 --> 06:36.980
How is Mr Newbold?

06:37.020 --> 06:38.620
Slippery.

06:38.660 --> 06:39.979
I volunteered to do his ironing,

06:39.980 --> 06:44.100
but he seems reluctant to let me
anywhere near his boxers.

06:44.140 --> 06:46.340
My old granny used to read tea
leaves,

06:46.380 --> 06:50.020
but I found you can read a man much
better by his choice of underwear.

06:50.060 --> 06:52.220
Beware of jockey shorts.

06:52.260 --> 06:54.660
They should come with a health
warning.

06:54.700 --> 06:58.139
I've had three husbands,
all in boxers, or even baggier,

06:58.140 --> 07:00.140
the time it takes them to work their
way out

07:00.180 --> 07:01.980
gives a girl time to reconsider.

07:17.260 --> 07:19.219
Ah, Cyril's head.

07:19.220 --> 07:21.900
I hope it's brought the rest of you
with it.

07:21.940 --> 07:24.979
I'm not buying. I'm just asking.

07:24.980 --> 07:27.379
It says, "Ask inside."

07:27.380 --> 07:29.459
Well, technically, you're not
inside, are you?

07:29.460 --> 07:31.020
So, come on, come in.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.580
I'm not buying. Do you understand?

07:35.620 --> 07:37.699
Yes, I know, you've already said
that.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.740
You don't need to repeat yourself.

07:39.780 --> 07:43.420
Once you've been in this shop a few
times you develop a certain caution.

07:43.460 --> 07:45.859
I'm only asking, mind you.

07:45.860 --> 07:50.020
What's this high-energy food
breakthrough?

07:53.580 --> 07:55.059
Christmas puddings?

07:55.060 --> 07:57.220
It's hardly the season.

07:57.260 --> 08:01.700
That's because you think these are
ordinary Christmas puddings.

08:06.980 --> 08:09.019
Why don't we do something different?

08:09.020 --> 08:11.059
Because we'd still be the same
people.

08:11.060 --> 08:13.019
How different is that?

08:13.020 --> 08:15.300
There's a flaw in that logic
somewhere.

08:15.340 --> 08:19.780
OK, why don't we do something that's
not different more often?

08:19.820 --> 08:21.380
SHE GASPS

08:21.420 --> 08:22.780
I thought you'd never ask.

08:24.900 --> 08:27.100
I'll provide the wallpaper
and paint.

08:35.460 --> 08:37.020
Forget it.

08:43.500 --> 08:47.820
This particular brand has only ever
been seen

08:47.860 --> 08:51.620
since those flying saucers were seen
hovering over Mexborough.

08:53.140 --> 08:56.820
Because an eyewitness said they
looked more like pudding basins.

08:57.980 --> 09:00.700
Christmas puddings of alien origin?

09:02.300 --> 09:05.300
Dropped by a basin-shaped spaceship?

09:06.540 --> 09:09.139
Over Mexborough?

09:09.140 --> 09:14.500
Not just over Mexborough, but as far
afield as Adwick-on-Dearne.

09:15.980 --> 09:19.380
Why would aliens be dropping
Christmas puddings anywhere?

09:19.420 --> 09:23.980
I'm glad you asked me that because
at first it puzzled me,

09:24.020 --> 09:28.180
but then you began to see the
diabolical cleverness of it.

09:33.540 --> 09:36.499
It escapes me. And me.

09:36.500 --> 09:41.620
This stuff looks harmless, but it
contains a secret ingredient

09:41.660 --> 09:47.300
that turned people onto the
single-minded pursuit of pleasure.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.060
In Mexborough?

09:55.660 --> 09:58.260
Well, today Mexborough,
tomorrow the world.

09:58.300 --> 09:59.579
You see?

09:59.580 --> 10:02.540
Whilst everybody is having fun
and making...

10:02.580 --> 10:05.020
You know, making whoopee.

10:06.860 --> 10:08.860
..the aliens would have landed.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.100
How come you know all this stuff?

10:12.140 --> 10:16.780
Because the government is having to
work closely with the grocers' federation.

10:16.820 --> 10:21.700
They need our expertise, which is
why I'm authorised to sell...

10:21.740 --> 10:25.100
Well, to selected, responsible
people only.

10:27.580 --> 10:29.260
Sounds like us.

10:31.020 --> 10:33.620
Can't argue with that.

10:33.660 --> 10:37.859
Well, it's people in our
professional grocers' judgment

10:37.860 --> 10:41.780
will be able to handle the effects.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.420
The loss of all inhibitions.

10:46.460 --> 10:48.020
Ooh!

10:53.900 --> 10:57.580
Obviously, you can't just let these
go to anybody.

10:58.940 --> 11:01.540
You'll have people going crazy,
making whoopee.

11:03.060 --> 11:05.420
Would that be people of both
genders?

11:07.460 --> 11:09.900
Yes, yes. And any in between.

11:12.980 --> 11:19.100
This harmless looking piece of duff
is basically your Viagra.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.779
Although, we recommend that you use
it with...

11:24.780 --> 11:27.340
Well, a little... Champagne?

11:28.700 --> 11:30.140
Roses?

11:30.180 --> 11:31.700
Custard.

11:35.540 --> 11:40.419
Now, I'm going to have to ask you to take
these from the shop in a brown paper bag.

11:40.420 --> 11:42.139
No problem.

11:42.140 --> 11:48.539
But first, I am required to ask you
to swear an oath of silence.

11:48.540 --> 11:50.220
Raise your right hand.

11:55.820 --> 11:57.940
Put your left hand on the custard.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.900
And swear after me...

12:01.940 --> 12:04.620
I promise by this tin of custard...

12:04.660 --> 12:08.460
BOTH: I promise by this tin of
custard...

12:08.500 --> 12:11.140
Which is exceedingly good value...

12:20.900 --> 12:22.700
I just know Kath's going to say,

12:22.740 --> 12:25.740
"What the hell are you doing buying
Christmas puddings?!"

12:25.780 --> 12:28.020
So, we pick the moment and we say...

12:29.860 --> 12:31.860
"Hey, do you know what I fancy right
now?

12:33.100 --> 12:35.059
"A bit of Christmas pudding."

12:35.060 --> 12:37.100
And make sure they eat the other
half.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.500
Hello!

12:50.580 --> 12:52.580
THEY SCREAM

12:52.620 --> 12:54.459
Oh, you gave me a fright!

12:54.460 --> 12:55.899
Sh, sh! Hey, hey!

12:55.900 --> 12:58.860
Not allowed. If he asks, tell him I
sold you a fright.

12:58.900 --> 13:01.820
There's a house rule against giving.

13:03.740 --> 13:05.660
What are you doing behind there?

13:05.700 --> 13:08.979
Have you got a bed down there?
No, but it's not a bad idea.

13:08.980 --> 13:10.020
Oh.

13:12.340 --> 13:14.579
No, they get me up too early,
you see.

13:14.580 --> 13:17.180
My body clock doesn't really run on
Arkwright time.

13:17.220 --> 13:19.219
You need a rewind.

13:19.220 --> 13:21.620
Or just a lie in.

13:21.660 --> 13:23.260
At the risk of being forward,

13:23.300 --> 13:26.100
could I ask what you were doing
behind the counter?

13:28.540 --> 13:30.140
Tinkering? Ah, yes.

13:30.180 --> 13:33.900
The old tinkering... It's been years
since I've had a good tinker.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.060
We often wonder, you know,

13:39.100 --> 13:42.779
what goodies are available behind
that counter.

13:42.780 --> 13:46.339
Oh, well, at the moment, a stack of
Christmas puddings.

13:46.340 --> 13:49.499
Don't ask. You're pulling my leg.

13:49.500 --> 13:52.179
Or is that wishful thinking?

13:52.180 --> 13:55.340
Oh, some mischievous spirit inserted
into this conversation.

13:55.380 --> 13:57.140
Yeah, yeah.

13:57.180 --> 13:59.380
They do, don't they? Yeah.

14:03.740 --> 14:06.820
Sh! Did you hear that?

14:06.860 --> 14:08.299
Oh, give up.

14:08.300 --> 14:09.619
There's nobody upstairs.

14:09.620 --> 14:10.980
I've just checked, again.

14:11.020 --> 14:13.620
Well, I know how thorough you are.

14:13.660 --> 14:17.179
You probably went up there
and forgot what you went for.

14:17.180 --> 14:19.500
You're worse than Mrs Patrick.

14:19.540 --> 14:21.860
She was always hearing things.

14:21.900 --> 14:24.139
Particularly about Mr Patrick.

14:24.140 --> 14:26.500
She claimed she was psychic.

14:26.540 --> 14:28.659
Maybe I'm a bit psychic.

14:28.660 --> 14:32.540
It didn't stop you picking someone
nasty for a husband.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.180
He looked so nice in a suit.

14:35.220 --> 14:37.380
Well, what about you?

14:37.420 --> 14:39.020
Yours was no better.

14:39.060 --> 14:41.420
At least I knew that before I
married him.

14:41.460 --> 14:43.379
So, why did you marry him?

14:43.380 --> 14:45.100
He told me I was pregnant.

14:49.820 --> 14:52.379
So, what is Madge's problem?

14:52.380 --> 14:55.499
Apart from her long battle against
being pleasant.

14:55.500 --> 14:59.340
She's convinced our place is haunted
now.

14:59.380 --> 15:03.260
Oh, well, there's always been a
disturbing presence there.

15:04.460 --> 15:06.740
It's your Madge.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.260
It is.

15:09.980 --> 15:12.900
She's heard something going bang in
the night.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.060
What? At your place?

15:16.100 --> 15:17.620
Don't knock it.

15:17.660 --> 15:19.860
One night, I hope it could be me.

15:27.500 --> 15:31.219
Never heard the bell.
You're creeping up on people.

15:31.220 --> 15:33.940
So, this may come as something of a
surprise.

15:38.580 --> 15:39.980
It's my fault.

15:40.980 --> 15:44.020
I didn't believe his Christmas
pudding story,

15:44.060 --> 15:46.220
which led to him showing me his...

15:46.260 --> 15:49.299
ideas for improved workflow behind
here.

15:49.300 --> 15:51.700
Still in the planning stage.

15:51.740 --> 15:54.660
A few wrinkles that we need to...
iron out.

16:00.740 --> 16:03.940
I hope it is still in the planning
stage.

16:33.740 --> 16:35.220
I passed Madge.

16:37.180 --> 16:38.860
I gave her a wave.

16:38.900 --> 16:40.579
She gave me a look.

16:40.580 --> 16:42.500
Oh, I can see it now.

16:42.540 --> 16:46.780
Her eyes were irresistibly drawn
towards you, eh?

16:46.820 --> 16:49.420
Well, if it didn't say, "Drop-dead,"

16:49.460 --> 16:52.460
it were a look that said something
like...

16:52.500 --> 16:55.180
"kindly leave the universe."

16:55.220 --> 16:57.300
Which we've noticed you've ignored.

16:59.180 --> 17:02.820
You see, Madge hasn't spotted your
darker side.

17:02.860 --> 17:04.459
Darker side?

17:04.460 --> 17:09.140
So you don't think that you've got a
darker side? Hm?

17:14.940 --> 17:16.619
CHUCKLING

17:18.740 --> 17:20.300
Try that.

17:25.579 --> 17:27.900
Not bad. What is it?

17:27.940 --> 17:31.539
50p. 50p for that?!

17:31.540 --> 17:33.700
Well, it includes delivery.

17:35.420 --> 17:39.459
What you've just eaten, Gastric, is
black pudding.

17:39.460 --> 17:41.140
Oh, I like black pudding.

17:41.180 --> 17:44.580
Ah, you see. That shows your darker
side.

17:44.620 --> 17:46.500
It's black pudding.

17:46.540 --> 17:49.740
And dammed expensive at 50p a hit.

17:49.780 --> 17:52.700
What's dark about black pudding,
you may ask?

17:52.740 --> 17:55.619
Well, it's made of blood, isn't it?

17:55.620 --> 18:00.300
So, now we've established that
you've got a taste for blood.

18:00.340 --> 18:04.180
Have you ever had your family
history checked?

18:04.220 --> 18:07.620
We don't speak to some cousins in
Newton-le-Fenwick.

18:07.660 --> 18:10.060
But that were their fault.

18:10.100 --> 18:13.140
Have you got any relatives in
Transylvania?

18:15.380 --> 18:16.940
Mainly Clitheroe.

18:18.220 --> 18:19.980
Well, that's close enough.

18:20.020 --> 18:24.260
It's clear to me, and to any
unbiased person, Gastric,

18:24.300 --> 18:27.940
that you have some Dracula in your
DNA.

18:41.980 --> 18:46.659
Oh! How are you today,
Mrs Featherstone?

18:46.660 --> 18:50.779
Probably on the downward slope from
the prime years, Granville,

18:50.780 --> 18:55.179
but they're still a lot here for persons
of an adventurous disposition.

18:55.180 --> 18:56.780
HE CLEARS THROAT

18:56.820 --> 18:58.420
How is Mr Newbold?

18:58.460 --> 19:01.460
I'm still looking for his
adventurous side.

19:01.500 --> 19:05.499
I invited him upstairs recently to
remove a squirrel from my loft.

19:05.500 --> 19:08.779
Well, you've got to test their basic
skills.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.900
And how are his basic skills?

19:10.940 --> 19:13.660
I've no idea. He just removed a
squirrel from my loft.

19:17.740 --> 19:22.780
Now, Granville, how would you like
to slice me a little bacon?

19:24.740 --> 19:26.739
Half a pound, Mrs Featherstone?

19:26.740 --> 19:28.500
Or, enough for any single person.

19:30.660 --> 19:34.340
You know, Granville, I sometimes
look at you and I think,

19:34.380 --> 19:38.220
"Is he wasting his best years,
and if so, does he need a hand?"

19:39.300 --> 19:42.099
Shall I leave the rind on,
Mrs Featherstone?

19:42.100 --> 19:43.700
Oh, go along with you.

19:43.740 --> 19:45.740
I didn't come in here to get sporty.

19:51.460 --> 19:54.700
Not that I couldn't,
if the situation demanded it.

19:56.940 --> 19:59.740
Oh, go on. We're both adults.
Leave it on.

20:02.260 --> 20:06.660
What makes you think I can shift the
noises from Madge's place?

20:06.700 --> 20:10.739
You're going to impress Madge
with your knowledge.

20:10.740 --> 20:14.980
Oh, she'll just go, "Urgh!"
No, no, she won't,

20:15.020 --> 20:20.860
not when she hears how much you've
found out about the troubled spirit

20:20.900 --> 20:23.579
that is roaming her house.

20:23.580 --> 20:26.740
I don't believe... Yes, you do!

20:26.780 --> 20:33.980
We discovered that Madge's house
once belonged to...

20:35.140 --> 20:38.020
..a Crabist.

20:38.060 --> 20:40.820
What's a Crabist?
He's glad you asked that.

20:43.660 --> 20:48.900
The Crabists were fanatical
followers of a certain...

20:48.940 --> 20:51.619
cobbler. You see?

20:51.620 --> 20:53.780
Cobblers already.

20:53.820 --> 20:57.260
No, no... He was a prophet that
arose out of Birmingham.

20:57.300 --> 21:02.339
His name was Barry Crab,
and that is spelt cu-rah-ab-eh.

21:02.340 --> 21:04.819
Right? Shall I have to spell it?

21:04.820 --> 21:06.140
No, no.

21:06.180 --> 21:07.820
It's highly unlikely.

21:07.860 --> 21:11.660
All you have to do is just remember
that Barry Crab was hung,

21:11.700 --> 21:13.900
drawn and quartered, right,

21:13.940 --> 21:16.700
in the year 1540 for preaching that

21:16.740 --> 21:19.980
heaven was just outside
Stoke-on-Trent.

21:21.700 --> 21:26.500
So, there was once a Crabist in
Madge's house.

21:26.540 --> 21:28.819
How does that account for the
noises?

21:28.820 --> 21:34.180
Well, his followers all believed
that Preacher Crab, right,

21:34.220 --> 21:38.020
would one day return as promised.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.620
Am I to remember all this?

21:42.980 --> 21:46.660
Very unlikely. If you can't
remember, just go into a trance.

21:46.700 --> 21:48.859
How do I do that?

21:48.860 --> 21:50.860
That's it. Well done.

21:50.900 --> 21:53.500
That's it. Just do that. Perfect.

22:08.420 --> 22:12.820
While Leroy is getting Gastric ready
for Madge,

22:12.860 --> 22:18.060
I thought I might interest you in a
little bit of grocer's delight.

22:18.100 --> 22:20.700
Last time we got interrupted.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.820
I know, but I've told Leroy to take
his time.

22:23.860 --> 22:26.979
I never know what to wear for being
interrupted.

22:26.980 --> 22:29.419
I wish I'd worn something nicer.

22:29.420 --> 22:31.900
Oh, no, don't worry. You look great.

22:39.260 --> 22:41.020
How does he look? Early!

22:43.300 --> 22:46.539
Well, we can come back later.
No, it's too late.

22:46.540 --> 22:48.340
Why is he wearing make-up?

22:48.380 --> 22:50.780
I were wondering that.

22:50.820 --> 22:53.820
If I see any mates,
they'll be wondering that.

22:53.860 --> 22:59.340
Gastric is going to impress Madge by
banishing the spirits from her room,

22:59.380 --> 23:03.180
so we're trying to lift his image to
look a bit more...

23:03.220 --> 23:08.460
Well, you know, sinister.

23:10.140 --> 23:12.579
It's all right. You look...

23:12.580 --> 23:14.779
You look dishy.

23:14.780 --> 23:18.820
No, no. I don't mean dishy,
I mean... What do I mean?

23:20.300 --> 23:21.780
Ludicrous.

23:23.580 --> 23:25.899
Yes, ludicrous... No, not ludicrous.

23:25.900 --> 23:30.899
No, no. He's dressed like that to
stop Madge thinking that...

23:30.900 --> 23:32.699
What?

23:32.700 --> 23:34.860
Oh, tell him, will you, Leroy?

23:34.900 --> 23:38.539
Oh, yeah, pass it to me.
Tell me what?

23:38.540 --> 23:39.820
Mavis?

23:43.060 --> 23:46.140
Well, it's because she thinks you're
a...

23:46.180 --> 23:48.260
She kind of sees you as...

23:49.500 --> 23:52.940
Or you could say she has this
impression of you as...

23:52.980 --> 23:54.660
Of course, I could be wrong.

23:56.140 --> 23:58.820
Madge thinks you're a wally.

23:58.860 --> 24:01.460
And of course, you are a wally.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.659
But a nice wally.

24:03.660 --> 24:07.460
Oh, for a moment, I thought you were
going to say something rude to me.

24:13.700 --> 24:18.540
CAR HORN BLARES

24:18.580 --> 24:20.780
TYRES SCREECH

24:26.900 --> 24:28.300
CLATTERING

24:28.340 --> 24:30.020
Sh! I'm sorry.

24:30.060 --> 24:33.900
Right, the ladder's up near Madge's
window where she won't see it.

24:33.940 --> 24:36.100
I'm not clamouring up there again.

24:36.140 --> 24:37.740
It's not for you.

24:37.780 --> 24:39.460
It's for me.

24:39.500 --> 24:42.700
I'm going to go up the ladder,
in through the window,

24:42.740 --> 24:45.779
and then I'm going to stomp about

24:45.780 --> 24:51.220
and then I'm going to come out and
nip back down the ladder. All right.

24:51.260 --> 24:52.860
I think.

24:52.900 --> 24:58.379
And all you've got to do is command
Barry Crab to leave the premises.

24:58.380 --> 25:00.580
Right, I remember that bit.

25:00.620 --> 25:03.099
I can do that. Right, good.

25:03.100 --> 25:06.460
My hero.
You will be flavour of the month.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.940
Which month?

25:09.140 --> 25:11.540
Don't confuse him any more,
will you?

25:14.580 --> 25:16.300
Right, hold the bottom.

25:17.460 --> 25:19.460
I can't sleep in that room.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.700
Then you'll have to sleep in my
room.

25:21.740 --> 25:23.340
Well, you've got cold feet.

25:23.380 --> 25:25.339
Well, I sleep with them.

25:25.340 --> 25:27.580
BANGING

25:27.620 --> 25:29.179
Listen!

25:29.180 --> 25:32.180
BANGING

25:40.020 --> 25:41.620
Have no fear.

25:41.660 --> 25:43.060
The spirit shifter's here.

25:44.900 --> 25:46.580
Oh, give him a try.

25:46.620 --> 25:48.340
What have you got to lose?

25:51.260 --> 25:53.580
What a place to leave a ladder.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.499
Someone might walk into it.

25:55.500 --> 25:58.140
Or walk off with it.

25:58.180 --> 25:59.900
We'll put it in Granville's yard.

26:00.940 --> 26:02.940
I'm getting a good feeling.

26:02.980 --> 26:05.180
Doing something for the community.

26:05.220 --> 26:06.780
That Eric...

26:07.980 --> 26:10.020
..they'll say...

26:10.060 --> 26:12.299
public spirited.

26:12.300 --> 26:15.579
That Eric, they'll say, making a bog
off carrying a ladder.

26:15.580 --> 26:17.420
It's heavier than it looks.

26:19.060 --> 26:21.780
So, is life since Mrs Featherstone.

26:23.620 --> 26:35.619
BANGING

26:35.620 --> 26:37.980
That sounds to me like...

26:39.780 --> 26:41.460
..Barry Crab.

26:43.180 --> 26:45.139
I command thee,

26:45.140 --> 26:46.620
leave this house!

26:48.860 --> 26:50.940
BANGING STOPS

27:10.180 --> 27:12.020
Argh!

27:14.260 --> 27:18.100
Urgh! Aw! Ooh!

27:18.140 --> 27:19.500
Ooh!

27:24.620 --> 27:26.220
I'm sorry, Mrs Featherstone.

27:26.260 --> 27:29.660
No, this is more excitement than
I've had all week.

27:37.260 --> 27:41.460
'I must stop lying on
Mrs Featherstone.

27:41.500 --> 27:44.100
'I'd like to know who moved that
ladder.

27:52.500 --> 27:57.379
'Still, at least Gastric finally got
a smile from Madge.

27:57.380 --> 27:59.340
'At least he thought it was a smile.

28:03.820 --> 28:07.860
'Lord, keep us free from all flying
basins tonight.

28:10.340 --> 28:14.179
'A powerful grip,
that Mrs Featherstone.

28:14.180 --> 28:17.380
'Who would believe it took ten
minutes to wriggle free?'
