00:45.390 --> 00:49.599
There once
was a girl called Maude.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.337
Who picked up a
strange creature.

00:54.041 --> 00:56.914
And brought it to her home.

01:11.578 --> 01:13.145
of the
rural cathedral city

01:13.146 --> 01:15.651
of Hereford which
shattered this morning.

01:29.580 --> 01:31.048
Upon the discovery
late last night

01:31.049 --> 01:33.821
of several dismembered bodies.

01:38.363 --> 01:39.599
Local police believe
we may be dealing

01:39.600 --> 01:42.370
with Hereford's
first serial killer.

05:50.399 --> 05:51.902
- Do you want to drive?

05:51.903 --> 05:52.905
- No thanks.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.540
Oh, too much light.

06:45.442 --> 06:46.410
What are you doing?

06:49.483 --> 06:50.853
- I don't remember.

06:52.522 --> 06:54.360
Being so much noise around here.

06:56.130 --> 06:57.465
Not in the morning.

06:57.466 --> 06:58.468
Come to bed.

07:47.499 --> 07:48.334
What is it?

07:50.372 --> 07:52.141
- Nothing.

07:52.142 --> 07:53.378
Nightmares again?

07:55.615 --> 07:58.488
- Just thinking about
things, that's all.

07:59.723 --> 08:01.995
You think too much.

09:19.416 --> 09:20.251
- Ken.

09:24.293 --> 09:25.128
Ken.

10:00.797 --> 10:03.202
- Is everything alright?

10:03.203 --> 10:06.175
You seem a bit embarrassed
about something.

10:08.980 --> 10:10.217
- Nope, not me.

10:12.254 --> 10:14.092
- What was that about?

10:15.761 --> 10:17.363
Counting on me reading your mind

10:17.364 --> 10:18.733
with my super powers?

10:26.249 --> 10:27.184
What is it?

10:29.388 --> 10:31.592
- We've been given a
month's notice to quit.

10:36.536 --> 10:37.604
- We're being evicted?

10:38.940 --> 10:39.742
- Yep.

10:41.279 --> 10:42.547
- My God, is it
because I complained

10:42.548 --> 10:43.482
about the stair
carpet, isn't it?

10:43.483 --> 10:44.684
It's got to be.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.354
It's too much of a coincidence.

10:46.355 --> 10:48.592
It's thread bare.
- I know.

10:48.593 --> 10:49.794
- One complaint in four years,

10:49.795 --> 10:51.064
and he goes and does this.

10:52.534 --> 10:54.237
Jesus, Connor, we're being
evicted and you're laughing.

10:54.238 --> 10:56.209
- No, I'm not laughing at you.

10:56.210 --> 10:57.310
It's him.

10:57.311 --> 10:58.378
He's nuts.

10:58.379 --> 11:00.150
He'd rather get rid of us

11:00.151 --> 11:01.284
than buy a new stair carpet.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.488
He's a cheapskate twat.

11:05.994 --> 11:08.866
Okay, well, might not be
funny now, but, you know,

11:08.867 --> 11:10.370
in the grand scheme of things.

11:13.543 --> 11:14.778
Or not.

11:14.779 --> 11:16.348
- I'm so sick of
living like this.

11:16.349 --> 11:18.352
We should have our own place.

11:18.353 --> 11:19.821
- We'll find somewhere.

11:19.822 --> 11:20.657
We will.

11:22.026 --> 11:25.032
Somewhere with even
tackier carpets.

11:26.669 --> 11:28.972
- I can get on to
the letting agencies.

11:28.973 --> 11:30.977
I'm free this afternoon.

11:33.516 --> 11:34.351
- We'll be okay.

11:36.021 --> 11:36.856
- Yeah.

12:10.022 --> 12:11.259
- Here will do.

12:11.260 --> 12:12.025
- Don't be daft,
I'll drop you off.

12:12.026 --> 12:13.363
- No, it's fine.

12:13.364 --> 12:15.599
Don't want you doing
that to your car.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.840
- You want your mates
to take the piss.

12:20.510 --> 12:21.346
- No?

12:27.358 --> 12:28.927
I'll see you later.

13:11.446 --> 13:12.714
- Love the car.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.305
- I thoroughly enjoyed
the chocolate biscuits.

14:15.306 --> 14:16.307
- Every time.

14:16.308 --> 14:17.142
- Why not?

14:37.048 --> 14:38.386
- There you are.

14:39.421 --> 14:40.254
- Oh.

14:41.190 --> 14:42.360
I'm so sorry.

14:46.768 --> 14:47.970
- Is everything alright?

14:51.243 --> 14:53.649
I was gonna say, it's
probably cold by now.

15:16.562 --> 15:17.730
- No, no, it's fine, thanks.

15:17.731 --> 15:19.734
I'm awash with tea.

15:19.735 --> 15:22.170
Jess says I drink too
much of the stuff.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.543
- Oh, she's only
looking after you.

15:24.544 --> 15:25.413
And your bladder.

15:50.361 --> 15:51.597
Take care, sweetheart.

15:51.598 --> 15:54.234
Thank you so much for
being so understanding.

15:54.235 --> 15:56.105
- Oh, well.

15:56.106 --> 15:57.643
- Been a tough couple of weeks,

15:57.644 --> 16:00.615
what with bills, the car
needing four new tires.

16:00.616 --> 16:02.084
It's all those bloody potholes.

16:02.085 --> 16:04.021
- Back to normal
next month, though.

16:04.022 --> 16:05.323
And like we said, we'll
give you a bit more.

16:05.324 --> 16:07.497
Talk about 200,
much appreciated.

16:08.532 --> 16:10.968
- Take care.
- You too, love.

16:10.969 --> 16:11.805
- Bye.

16:13.476 --> 16:18.486
That was bizarre.

16:28.672 --> 16:30.306
The hunt
for international superstar

16:30.307 --> 16:32.945
and south lake billionaire,
Jean Claud Miraud,

16:32.946 --> 16:34.817
continues with a recent

16:34.818 --> 16:37.387
sighting of him off the
north coast of France

16:37.388 --> 16:38.858
earlier today.

16:38.859 --> 16:40.629
It is understood he was trying

16:40.630 --> 16:42.666
to cross the English
channel in an attempt

16:42.667 --> 16:45.003
to evade French authorities

16:45.004 --> 16:47.543
over his recent

16:47.544 --> 16:48.711
To Hereford now,

16:48.712 --> 16:50.246
where concerns are
growing for the welfare

16:50.247 --> 16:52.284
of three missing persons.

16:52.285 --> 16:54.054
Detectives released a statement

16:54.055 --> 16:55.692
that the three were last seen

16:55.693 --> 16:57.930
leaving the Lutt
Cinema in West Street

16:57.931 --> 17:01.637
at approximately
11:55 pm on Saturday.

17:01.638 --> 17:02.873
They are eager to speak

17:02.874 --> 17:04.510
with the owner of
a black transit Van

17:04.511 --> 17:06.547
seen parked in the street

17:06.548 --> 17:08.349
right of the disappearance.
- Hello!

17:08.350 --> 17:10.221
- God, you scared
the shit out of me.

17:13.662 --> 17:15.363
Did Mike give you a lift?

17:15.364 --> 17:18.872
Yeah.

17:18.873 --> 17:22.111
How'd you get on with
letting agencies?

17:24.349 --> 17:25.451
That bad, eh?

17:26.855 --> 17:27.690
- Yeah.

17:28.926 --> 17:29.761
- Well,

17:31.329 --> 17:33.199
we'll find a solution.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.035
We always do.

17:38.343 --> 17:39.580
Worst case scenario,

17:39.581 --> 17:41.984
we'll have to put you
to work on Castle Green.

17:41.985 --> 17:43.120
I'd do it myself, but,

17:44.023 --> 17:45.223
don't look that great in heels.

17:45.224 --> 17:46.059
- Shut up.

17:48.196 --> 17:50.702
- What?

17:50.703 --> 17:53.675
Quite rather fancy myself
as a bit of a pimp.

17:53.676 --> 17:54.744
- Oh, my god.

17:58.215 --> 18:00.019
- Have you called
your mom lately?

18:00.020 --> 18:00.855
- No.

18:03.628 --> 18:04.461
- You should.

18:07.001 --> 18:08.537
- I know.

18:08.538 --> 18:09.371
But...

18:11.408 --> 18:14.649
I know, I'll call her
at the end of the week.

18:14.650 --> 18:15.483
Leave it.

18:17.187 --> 18:21.930
Okay.

18:21.931 --> 18:25.839
You sure about that Castle
Green thing, though?

18:42.437 --> 18:43.272
- Ken.

18:44.977 --> 18:46.378
Is that you, Ken?

18:51.156 --> 18:52.356
Of course it's me.

18:52.357 --> 18:54.327
Who else do you think it is?

18:57.233 --> 18:58.402
Here, darling.

19:04.514 --> 19:05.718
What's up?

19:05.719 --> 19:07.153
- Nothing.

19:07.154 --> 19:08.521
Nothing.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.359
Just glad you're home.

19:11.295 --> 19:12.932
- Everything alright?

19:12.933 --> 19:14.366
- Fine.

19:14.367 --> 19:16.707
Just been one of those days.

19:24.521 --> 19:25.589
We're out of beer.

19:25.590 --> 19:26.927
- Oh, I'm sorry.

19:27.829 --> 19:30.032
I'll get some in for tomorrow.

19:30.033 --> 19:31.002
How was your day?

19:31.871 --> 19:32.773
Uh, so-so.

19:33.775 --> 19:35.042
Still haven't finished that

19:35.043 --> 19:38.984
flaming battle job,
cowboy installation.

19:38.985 --> 19:40.186
Christ, you should see it.

19:40.187 --> 19:42.289
They have massive pipes
all over the place.

19:42.290 --> 19:43.960
Bloody nightmare.

19:43.961 --> 19:46.666
Visitors?
- Sue and Jeff.

19:46.667 --> 19:48.102
On the cards again.

19:48.103 --> 19:50.106
What do they want this time?

19:50.107 --> 19:51.440
- Ah, they just called in

19:51.441 --> 19:52.678
all the way back from town.

19:52.679 --> 19:55.117
Seemed very grateful
about something.

19:56.418 --> 19:57.955
Water's still hot.

19:57.956 --> 20:00.026
Why don't you jump
in the shower?

20:00.027 --> 20:01.328
Yeah, in a minute.

20:02.564 --> 20:03.800
What were they so
grateful about?

20:03.801 --> 20:06.906
- Oh, nothing important.

20:06.907 --> 20:09.278
You know what they're
like, full of themselves.

20:10.379 --> 20:12.583
I stopped listening
after a while.

20:12.584 --> 20:13.518
Just as
long as they weren't

20:13.519 --> 20:14.655
trying to squirm their way

20:14.656 --> 20:16.059
out of paying back the cash.

20:19.733 --> 20:21.235
What have you done?

20:21.236 --> 20:22.771
- They just asked
if they could defer

20:22.772 --> 20:23.875
this month's payment.

20:25.344 --> 20:27.446
They've been having
a bit of a hard time.

20:27.447 --> 20:29.450
Oh and you said yes.

20:29.451 --> 20:31.621
I knew this would
happen, I knew it.

20:31.622 --> 20:32.925
Shouldn't have lent
them four quid,

20:32.926 --> 20:34.762
nevermind four grand.

20:34.763 --> 20:37.367
The sly bastards knew
better than to call in

20:37.368 --> 20:38.568
when I was here.

20:38.569 --> 20:39.906
No wonder they were grateful.

20:39.907 --> 20:41.408
And you gave them cake.

20:42.610 --> 20:43.813
- Oh, they'll be back
on track next month.

20:43.814 --> 20:45.350
They will be.
- Better bloody be.

20:46.418 --> 20:48.857
You have to stop being so nice.

20:48.858 --> 20:51.696
They ask you again,
you say no, okay?

20:51.697 --> 20:53.032
- Okay.

20:53.033 --> 20:54.969
Remember,
that's our holiday fund.

20:54.970 --> 20:56.238
They don't get it back in time,

20:56.239 --> 20:59.845
it's bye bye Las Vegas,
and hello Blackpool.

20:59.846 --> 21:00.646
I won't be happy.

21:01.481 --> 21:02.418
- Me neither.

21:03.721 --> 21:05.390
It's alright to say no.

21:09.597 --> 21:10.400
Want some tea?

21:19.820 --> 21:22.123
- I thought takeaway
tonight, yeah?

21:22.124 --> 21:23.491
You up for that?

21:23.492 --> 21:24.962
Always.

21:24.963 --> 21:25.798
- Thank god.

21:28.535 --> 21:29.670
I love you.

21:29.671 --> 21:30.742
I love you, too.

21:33.346 --> 21:34.181
- Ken.

21:35.283 --> 21:37.586
Do you ever wonder
where all the time went?

21:37.587 --> 21:38.522
Frequently.

21:41.496 --> 21:44.000
- Nobody warns you
about that, do they?

21:44.001 --> 21:44.969
Nope.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.074
- Not your parents, school.

21:48.410 --> 21:50.046
Life, eh?

21:50.047 --> 21:52.717
It should carry a good
until forewarning.

22:49.631 --> 22:52.736
Do you see
the beauty of it?

22:55.944 --> 22:59.683
Now, do you realize
what we've done?

23:06.064 --> 23:07.166
Look at them.

23:08.435 --> 23:09.504
- No, please.

23:10.772 --> 23:13.311
Look at them!

23:23.465 --> 23:25.402
Why are you doing this?

23:27.739 --> 23:30.679
We will be
forever dancing.

23:34.053 --> 23:34.888
Thank you.

25:50.158 --> 25:53.197
We've got
to talk about horror slightly.

25:53.198 --> 25:55.002
Halloween Eve.

25:55.003 --> 25:58.506
So, what better day than to
turn to modern heritages most-

26:15.174 --> 26:17.177
- Do you want a hand?

26:17.178 --> 26:18.079
- No, tah.

26:18.080 --> 26:19.782
I'm alright, Frank.

26:19.783 --> 26:20.917
I'll be done shortly.

26:20.918 --> 26:22.488
- You sure about that?

26:24.926 --> 26:26.395
Hey, you got a minute?

26:26.396 --> 26:27.632
Yeah, come with me.

26:31.074 --> 26:32.006
They
were later discovered

26:32.007 --> 26:33.309
by a local group of ramblers

26:33.310 --> 26:35.213
last Sunday afternoon.
- Get on the bus.

26:35.214 --> 26:36.849
Forensic investigators

26:36.850 --> 26:38.453
are now looking to determine

26:38.454 --> 26:40.022
the age of the remains.

26:40.024 --> 26:41.559
And their detectives
are confident

26:41.560 --> 26:42.861
that they are related

26:42.862 --> 26:45.035
to the recent
disappearances in the area.

26:45.968 --> 26:47.504
The investigation continues,

26:47.505 --> 26:50.009
and we will report on
any further information

26:50.010 --> 26:51.380
as it comes through.

27:17.899 --> 27:19.768
- That's the way to do it.

27:19.769 --> 27:21.806
That's the way to do it!

27:29.823 --> 27:31.559
- So you like puppet shows?

27:31.560 --> 27:33.629
Sorry, I didn't
mean to startle you.

27:33.630 --> 27:34.665
- Fine, it's fine.

27:34.666 --> 27:36.369
I just hate those things.

27:37.305 --> 27:41.245
- What, puppets?

27:47.159 --> 27:48.460
So you like dragons.

27:49.929 --> 27:52.801
- I don't think we're supposed
to like dragons, are we?

27:52.802 --> 27:55.039
- No, they're just
misunderstood.

27:55.908 --> 27:57.912
The bad boys of mythology.

27:58.981 --> 28:00.551
But they're not, really.

28:01.586 --> 28:02.889
They just want to survive.

28:04.292 --> 28:06.563
- You talk about them
as if they're real.

28:09.536 --> 28:11.972
They are.

28:11.973 --> 28:13.510
They're also magical, powerful,

28:15.848 --> 28:17.985
and as old as time.

28:37.458 --> 28:39.995
- He hasn't said anything
to me or his mother,

28:39.996 --> 28:42.534
who has actually known
him all his life.

28:42.535 --> 28:44.905
Has he ever said anything
to you about Nashville?

28:44.906 --> 28:46.309
I don't even know where it is.

28:46.310 --> 28:48.144
And he doesn't like
country and western.

28:48.145 --> 28:51.319
He said Dolly Parton
is an abomination.

28:53.191 --> 28:54.893
I wanted Hawaii,
and he knew that.

28:56.095 --> 28:58.866
Is this supposed to
be a heart or a bum?

28:58.867 --> 29:00.536
I wish he'd stop booking things

29:00.537 --> 29:03.509
without talking to
me about it first.

29:03.510 --> 29:05.347
Am I wrong here?

29:06.616 --> 29:07.919
- Am I being selfish?

29:08.787 --> 29:10.324
- It's not for me to say.

29:10.325 --> 29:11.157
- Hawaii is a special place,

29:11.158 --> 29:12.328
and I've always had my-

29:12.329 --> 29:14.765
- It's just a fucking holiday.

29:14.766 --> 29:16.237
Go or don't go, I don't care!

29:17.872 --> 29:18.707
- Beth.

29:34.973 --> 29:37.278
- Sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm really sorry.

29:37.279 --> 29:38.779
I didn't mean it.

29:38.780 --> 29:40.284
- No, you're right.

29:40.285 --> 29:42.921
It's not important in the
grand scheme of things,

29:42.922 --> 29:44.292
and we're very lucky.

29:44.293 --> 29:48.700
No Ally, please, it's me.

29:49.635 --> 29:51.706
I haven't been sleeping well.

29:52.575 --> 29:54.811
Don't know how to explain it.

29:54.812 --> 29:55.646
- Try.

29:57.451 --> 29:59.588
- I've never felt
like this before.

30:01.692 --> 30:03.962
It's like I'm losing myself.

30:03.963 --> 30:05.466
Fading away, I can feel it,

30:05.467 --> 30:06.934
and it's getting worse.

30:06.935 --> 30:09.341
- I think you're being
a bit hard on yourself.

30:09.342 --> 30:10.743
It's only been a few months.

30:11.945 --> 30:13.848
We all miss Ken.

30:13.849 --> 30:15.786
And if we feel like that,

30:15.787 --> 30:17.290
then what must you
be going through?

30:17.291 --> 30:18.758
- What do you mean?

30:18.759 --> 30:19.693
What are you talking about?

30:19.694 --> 30:21.697
- All I'm saying is,

30:21.698 --> 30:24.404
you need to give
yourself time to grieve.

30:24.405 --> 30:26.309
You're bound to be forgetful.
- Stop!

30:27.176 --> 30:28.280
Just stop.

30:40.404 --> 30:42.706
- Where are we going, Frank?

30:42.707 --> 30:46.449
- I want to show you something.

30:57.670 --> 30:59.140
What do you think?

31:00.611 --> 31:02.847
Is this somewhere you
could see yourself living?

31:12.065 --> 31:13.836
- No, I don't know...

31:22.252 --> 31:23.523
- Are you okay?

32:04.739 --> 32:05.839
- I have to go.

32:05.840 --> 32:06.642
- Beth, wait.

32:06.643 --> 32:08.243
- I really need to go.

32:08.244 --> 32:10.314
- Alright, but let
me come with you.

32:10.315 --> 32:11.817
- I forgot.

32:11.818 --> 32:14.088
I forgot that he was dead.

32:14.089 --> 32:15.892
He isn't here anymore.

32:15.893 --> 32:18.732
I see him, Allyson,
all the time.

32:18.733 --> 32:21.169
As clearly as I see you now.

32:21.170 --> 32:23.240
Last night, this morning...

32:23.241 --> 32:24.511
- Oh Beth.

32:24.512 --> 32:26.814
- Tell me I'm not
losing my mind.

32:26.815 --> 32:28.385
Oh God!

32:28.386 --> 32:29.789
- Don't be on your own.

33:31.110 --> 33:31.945
- Ken?

33:35.986 --> 33:37.222
- It's only me.

33:39.226 --> 33:40.896
Hello love.

33:40.897 --> 33:42.131
This is a surprise.

33:42.132 --> 33:43.033
- Yeah, I was just
down the road.

33:43.034 --> 33:45.673
Chest and back wax.

33:45.674 --> 33:48.009
Body builder, big baby.

33:48.010 --> 33:50.113
He blubbed all the
way through it.

33:51.083 --> 33:52.384
- I'll put the kettle on.

33:52.385 --> 33:56.560
- Oh I'm okay, actually.

33:56.561 --> 33:58.430
Why don't you come
to ours for dinner?

33:59.432 --> 34:00.469
Do you fancy a curry?

34:04.844 --> 34:06.346
- You've been talking to Ally.

34:07.314 --> 34:08.619
- She's worried about you.

34:19.774 --> 34:20.609
What's up?

34:26.486 --> 34:28.791
Mom?
- Nothing.

34:28.792 --> 34:30.663
Just adjusting to
being on my own.

34:32.032 --> 34:32.967
Your dad's still...

34:35.004 --> 34:37.440
He's still a presence
in the house.

34:37.441 --> 34:38.276
- I know.

34:39.847 --> 34:40.683
- How's Connor?

34:42.117 --> 34:43.689
- Yeah, he's good.

34:50.367 --> 34:53.173
We've been given notice
to leave the flat.

34:57.917 --> 34:59.150
- You know,

34:59.151 --> 35:00.688
you can always move in
with me for a while.

35:00.689 --> 35:01.890
Both of you can.

35:01.891 --> 35:03.928
If you don't find somewhere.

35:03.929 --> 35:04.797
- Oh thanks, mom.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.903
Something will turn
up, it always does.

35:09.641 --> 35:11.175
We were offered a place today.

35:12.847 --> 35:15.416
It's way out of our price range.

35:15.417 --> 35:17.055
- I'd help out, if I can.

35:18.189 --> 35:19.491
- Oh, it's cool.

35:19.492 --> 35:20.796
We already turned it down.

35:32.451 --> 35:33.253
What's wrong?

35:35.726 --> 35:36.995
- Needs a lot of work.

35:39.432 --> 35:40.602
- Yeah, I suppose.

35:41.771 --> 35:44.042
- Do you see yourselves
living in the country?

35:45.579 --> 35:46.412
- Maybe.

35:48.450 --> 35:49.953
I don't know, really.

35:49.954 --> 35:51.623
I don't really care where it is,

35:51.624 --> 35:52.860
as long as it's our own place.

35:53.995 --> 35:55.998
- This will be
all yours one day.

35:55.999 --> 35:57.769
- Don't talk like that.

35:57.770 --> 35:59.706
- Well none of us
are here forever.

35:59.707 --> 36:00.507
- Stop.

36:52.578 --> 36:53.580
Set, 9:30.

36:57.621 --> 37:00.695
Oh, bollocks.

37:47.322 --> 37:49.125
- How's that?
- That's good.

37:50.194 --> 37:52.700
Oh, so is that.
- That's it.

37:56.907 --> 37:58.642
More pressure?
- Yeah.

38:00.715 --> 38:03.551
- Oh you have some
nasty knots there.

38:03.552 --> 38:04.388
- Yeah.

38:08.964 --> 38:11.167
God, I needed this.
- Oh that's it.

38:11.168 --> 38:12.702
That's it, you're done.

38:12.703 --> 38:13.973
- Don't stop.

38:13.974 --> 38:16.610
- Sit up, I want to talk to you.

38:16.611 --> 38:18.547
- Oh, this don't sound good.

38:18.548 --> 38:20.219
- I don't know if it is.

38:20.220 --> 38:22.189
Or at least, I think it is.

38:22.190 --> 38:23.658
Or, it could be.

38:25.765 --> 38:28.368
I think I may have found a way

38:28.369 --> 38:30.140
for us to afford that house.

38:31.075 --> 38:32.009
- I told you before,

38:32.010 --> 38:33.211
we're not offing your mom.

38:33.212 --> 38:35.316
- Would you just be
serious for one second?

38:36.185 --> 38:37.020
- Okay.

38:37.922 --> 38:39.425
This is my serious face.

38:41.362 --> 38:44.734
Oh I'm being very serious.

38:52.050 --> 38:53.584
I'm listening, tell me.

38:53.585 --> 38:55.890
- Okay, you might not like it.

38:55.891 --> 39:00.868
But hear me out.

39:37.274 --> 39:39.277
Sweet dreams, eh love?

39:39.278 --> 39:42.416
- Ken, do you believe
in the coincidence

39:42.417 --> 39:45.223
between dreams and reality?

39:46.292 --> 39:47.227
No.

39:48.931 --> 39:51.101
- I only ever used to
have pleasant dreams.

39:52.703 --> 39:54.806
- Why oh why do you always start

39:54.807 --> 39:58.515
to make conversations when
I'm about to drop off?

39:58.516 --> 40:02.022
- At least, I only
remember the good ones.

40:02.023 --> 40:05.761
I was a happy kid,
had a happy life.

40:05.762 --> 40:06.966
- Oh yes.

40:06.967 --> 40:09.670
- I did have one
recurring nightmare.

40:09.671 --> 40:11.242
Kept coming back for a while.

40:13.246 --> 40:14.081
- Goodnight.

40:15.383 --> 40:17.086
- You don't want to know.

40:17.087 --> 40:17.955
It's stupid.

40:19.790 --> 40:22.530
I was chased by a
Mr. Punch puppet.

40:24.668 --> 40:27.805
Sounds stupid, but
it was really scary.

40:27.806 --> 40:28.643
It was.

40:30.113 --> 40:31.414
A great big hand,

40:31.415 --> 40:34.187
and red mottled face.

40:35.356 --> 40:38.561
Big nose and chin,
grinning at me.

40:38.562 --> 40:39.697
- That's what comes from eating

40:39.698 --> 40:42.036
too much cheese late at night.

40:42.037 --> 40:42.836
Go to sleep.

40:44.207 --> 40:45.243
- I'm trying.

46:28.960 --> 46:29.795
- Oh, mom.

46:35.441 --> 46:38.045
- Oh, I'd wish you'd knock.

46:48.566 --> 46:51.240
Is that Earl Gray, with milk?

47:10.977 --> 47:12.045
- See you tonight.

47:12.046 --> 47:12.880
Don't overdo it.

47:12.881 --> 47:14.386
- Not a lot to do.

47:15.754 --> 47:17.189
- Make sure she remembers
to have some lunch.

47:17.190 --> 47:18.792
- Yeah yeah yeah, look.

47:18.793 --> 47:20.663
I think you should
unpack some boxes later.

47:20.664 --> 47:21.832
I'm beginning not
to notice them.

47:21.833 --> 47:23.234
That's not good.

47:23.235 --> 47:24.871
- What's your hurry?

49:24.110 --> 49:25.145
- Won't be long.

49:26.516 --> 49:27.651
- Where are you off to?

49:27.652 --> 49:28.885
- A little exploring.

49:28.886 --> 49:31.526
Don't worry, I've got
my phone if I get lost.

49:33.228 --> 49:34.732
- Do you even know
how to use that thing?

49:34.733 --> 49:35.568
- Oh...

49:42.815 --> 49:44.249
- It's quiet?

49:44.250 --> 49:46.086
- I mean, the venue
itself lends itself to it,

49:46.087 --> 49:48.190
but we'll be right in, sir.

49:48.191 --> 49:50.295
Different locations,
aren't they?

49:52.568 --> 49:53.803
To be honest with you,

49:53.804 --> 49:56.305
it's totally up to you
what you do with it.

51:16.466 --> 51:20.141
There once
was a girl called Maude.

51:21.243 --> 51:23.816
- We need to stop
meeting around dragons.

51:25.318 --> 51:26.688
- Have we met?

51:26.689 --> 51:29.459
Sorry, my memory's not
what it used to be.

51:33.334 --> 51:35.338
- Dragons are misunderstood.

51:36.406 --> 51:37.676
- That.

51:37.677 --> 51:39.244
That was you.

51:39.245 --> 51:42.019
- Although technically,
it's not a dragon.

51:42.887 --> 51:43.990
It's a Wyvern.

51:45.391 --> 51:46.293
- A Wyvern?

51:47.631 --> 51:49.701
I thought Wyvern
House, where we live,

51:51.104 --> 51:53.306
I thought it must have
been named after the river.

51:53.307 --> 51:56.814
- You have a house
named after a dragon?

51:56.815 --> 51:57.717
Impressive.

51:58.953 --> 52:01.724
- I don't know about that.

52:01.725 --> 52:05.132
There's something about this
place, this village, it's,

52:07.036 --> 52:08.639
it's like I've been here before.

52:09.675 --> 52:11.077
- Maybe you have.

52:13.280 --> 52:14.150
- It's possible.

52:15.284 --> 52:18.023
I've forgotten so many things.

52:18.024 --> 52:23.034
Why is that, do you think?

52:45.411 --> 52:50.421
Fuck you.

53:29.532 --> 53:30.334
Beth?

53:32.405 --> 53:33.241
What's wrong?

53:36.379 --> 53:37.716
Alright.

53:37.717 --> 53:39.754
Easy, yeah, I can't
hear you too well.

53:41.356 --> 53:42.226
Where are you?

53:46.533 --> 53:48.070
Alright, look.

53:48.071 --> 53:50.406
Don't worry, I can find
my phone you, okay?

53:50.407 --> 53:52.746
Just stay where you are.

53:52.747 --> 53:53.882
I'll be there soon as.

53:57.856 --> 53:58.791
Oh, fuck.

54:01.731 --> 54:03.299
- Next time I expect
you to be here

54:03.300 --> 54:04.302
to show them around.

54:06.674 --> 54:09.077
Yeah, I understand that.

54:09.078 --> 54:11.081
But you'll be making the
best part of a tidy sum

54:11.082 --> 54:11.951
when they sell.

54:14.289 --> 54:17.661
I do not expect to have
to do your job for you.

54:23.875 --> 54:24.843
Yeah, okay.

54:27.580 --> 54:28.417
Yeah, okay.

54:30.054 --> 54:31.790
I don't know what his name was.

54:31.791 --> 54:32.926
He said you turned him.

54:34.461 --> 54:35.297
Well didn't you?

54:38.602 --> 54:39.671
I don't know.

54:41.675 --> 54:42.746
I don't know.

54:44.115 --> 54:46.086
Maybe he read a
blurb in your window.

54:59.544 --> 55:01.382
Yeah, I'll tell him.

55:01.383 --> 55:02.819
Okay, yeah.

55:10.902 --> 55:11.737
Bollocks.

56:10.254 --> 56:11.156
Is that you, mate?

56:13.828 --> 56:16.199
Just been on to
Prescott's Estate agents.

56:18.103 --> 56:19.605
They want you to get in touch.

56:21.009 --> 56:21.944
Probably...

56:30.427 --> 56:35.437
Hello?

58:44.594 --> 58:45.429
- Beth?

58:49.270 --> 58:50.573
Come on, Dorothy.

58:51.775 --> 58:53.812
I have a feeling we're
not in Kansas anymore.

59:00.292 --> 59:02.196
You walked all this way?

59:03.799 --> 59:04.601
Through fields?

59:07.473 --> 59:08.609
Suppose you didn't fly.

59:10.145 --> 59:11.380
- Ass.

59:11.381 --> 59:13.784
- You'll be hiding your
own Easter eggs soon.

59:13.785 --> 59:14.787
- Hilarious.

59:25.843 --> 59:27.546
- You alright?

59:27.547 --> 59:28.881
- I'm fine.

59:28.882 --> 59:30.852
I just lost my bearings.

59:30.853 --> 59:31.990
I feel very silly.

59:33.659 --> 59:35.261
- You're a bit out of the way.

59:35.262 --> 59:36.497
- I know.

59:36.498 --> 59:38.101
I was never very
good at geography.

59:40.172 --> 59:41.008
- Geography.

59:43.712 --> 59:44.714
Right.

59:49.958 --> 59:53.164
You know, what you did for us,

59:53.165 --> 59:55.168
we're so grateful.
- Oh no, no.

59:55.169 --> 59:57.472
- No, if you hadn't come
in with us on the house,

59:57.473 --> 59:59.177
we'd never been
able to afford it.

1:00:00.346 --> 1:00:03.085
I know you didn't like
the place at first.

1:00:03.086 --> 1:00:06.190
- It was just a bit strange
at first, that's all.

1:00:06.191 --> 1:00:07.360
It's okay now.

1:00:09.664 --> 1:00:11.267
- We all miss him, you know.

1:00:15.576 --> 1:00:16.978
Do you remember that summer?

1:00:18.248 --> 1:00:19.816
We did that barbecue.

1:00:21.122 --> 1:00:23.691
- He made his famous burgers.

1:00:23.692 --> 1:00:25.329
God, they were disgusting.

1:00:26.364 --> 1:00:27.433
- Yeah, proper rank.

1:00:30.106 --> 1:00:32.041
- It was good though, wasn't it?

1:00:32.042 --> 1:00:33.378
- It really was.

1:00:34.747 --> 1:00:36.085
- It really was.

1:00:41.861 --> 1:00:43.165
The church.

1:00:43.166 --> 1:00:45.602
Connor, please, I need
to check on something.

1:01:06.009 --> 1:01:08.415
- Anybody home?
- No, no one's here.

1:01:11.387 --> 1:01:13.324
- Yoohoo, Beth?

1:01:13.325 --> 1:01:14.760
We did say one
o'clock, didn't we?

1:01:14.761 --> 1:01:16.029
- It's 20 past.

1:01:17.566 --> 1:01:19.636
- Maybe she thought
we weren't coming.

1:01:19.637 --> 1:01:21.005
- Where's the bedroom?

1:01:21.006 --> 1:01:22.408
- More like she's forgot.

1:01:22.409 --> 1:01:24.380
- Either way, where's
the bloody money?

1:01:29.423 --> 1:01:31.960
Maybe she's locked
herself in the attic.

1:01:31.961 --> 1:01:33.265
Like Anne Frank.

1:01:36.971 --> 1:01:38.340
Have you tried calling her?

1:01:38.341 --> 1:01:39.944
- Straight to answering machine.

1:01:45.989 --> 1:01:47.326
It's bigger than I thought.

1:01:49.198 --> 1:01:50.766
It will look lovely
when it's finished.

1:02:04.160 --> 1:02:05.995
- Have they got a cat?

1:02:10.070 --> 1:02:10.905
There's a slash.

1:02:38.261 --> 1:02:40.096
I'm gonna piss myself.

1:03:28.994 --> 1:03:30.664
Here, kitty kitty...

1:04:41.607 --> 1:04:43.843
- I couldn't believe
it when I saw it.

1:04:43.844 --> 1:04:45.448
Isn't it amazing?

1:04:48.119 --> 1:04:48.954
- Yeah.

1:04:53.665 --> 1:04:54.500
- Hello.

1:05:06.657 --> 1:05:07.891
- You took your time.

1:05:07.892 --> 1:05:10.029
Oh, tell me you didn't
do a number two.

1:05:15.073 --> 1:05:17.077
- I see you're
interested in our dragon.

1:05:18.947 --> 1:05:20.652
I assume you know the tale.

1:05:22.356 --> 1:05:25.326
The creature was found
when it was very young.

1:05:26.963 --> 1:05:29.935
By a girl called Maude.

1:05:29.936 --> 1:05:31.439
She fed it.

1:05:31.440 --> 1:05:32.240
She loved it.

1:05:33.977 --> 1:05:36.247
It grew up.

1:05:36.248 --> 1:05:41.257
Got fed up on a diet
of milk and vegetables.

1:05:41.258 --> 1:05:44.667
Started to steal local
cattle and sheep.

1:05:47.406 --> 1:05:48.675
It got a taste for meat.

1:05:51.447 --> 1:05:53.247
It angered the farmers,

1:05:53.248 --> 1:05:55.018
who attempted to destroy it.

1:05:56.220 --> 1:05:58.158
But of course, inevitably,

1:05:59.293 --> 1:06:01.363
they sealed their own fate

1:06:01.364 --> 1:06:04.970
and marched to their death.

1:06:04.971 --> 1:06:09.012
Some say the local
squire's son killed it.

1:06:09.013 --> 1:06:11.283
Others say,

1:06:11.284 --> 1:06:12.554
that it never left.

1:06:12.555 --> 1:06:17.129
It stays, hidden,
waiting patiently,

1:06:18.899 --> 1:06:21.539
in the darkness of Wyvern Hill.

1:06:57.109 --> 1:06:57.944
- Oh, wet feet.

1:07:07.396 --> 1:07:09.701
Ham and coleslaw
Sammy and a cuppa?

1:07:09.702 --> 1:07:10.703
- Yeah, I'll do it.

1:07:10.704 --> 1:07:11.638
- No, let me.

1:07:11.639 --> 1:07:13.308
It's the least I can do.

1:07:14.846 --> 1:07:15.814
- Okay, thanks.

1:07:17.485 --> 1:07:18.318
You know.

1:07:20.222 --> 1:07:22.358
It's great waking
up to a mug of tea

1:07:22.359 --> 1:07:24.129
on the bedside
table every morning,

1:07:25.265 --> 1:07:26.870
but you really don't
need to do that.

1:07:27.872 --> 1:07:28.840
- Point taken.

1:07:30.075 --> 1:07:32.480
- You're not here
to look after us.

1:07:32.481 --> 1:07:34.382
- Yes, but,

1:07:34.383 --> 1:07:36.589
I hope you don't mind me asking.

1:07:38.458 --> 1:07:39.595
But who are you?

1:07:47.209 --> 1:07:50.181
Fair one.

1:08:56.514 --> 1:08:57.784
- You do think we
did the right thing

1:08:57.785 --> 1:08:59.485
moving mom in with
us, don't you?

1:08:59.486 --> 1:09:01.389
- I think so, yeah.

1:09:01.390 --> 1:09:02.727
- Thanks.

1:09:02.728 --> 1:09:03.996
You know, not every
guy would agree

1:09:03.997 --> 1:09:05.065
to move in with his girlfriend

1:09:05.066 --> 1:09:06.300
and his girlfriend's mom.

1:09:07.838 --> 1:09:10.240
- Well, she's a good egg.

1:09:10.241 --> 1:09:11.510
- She really likes you.

1:09:13.883 --> 1:09:15.620
- She needs to see
someone, though.

1:09:18.626 --> 1:09:20.996
Well I told her about
the morning tea business.

1:09:20.997 --> 1:09:21.832
- Oh, what did she say?

1:09:21.833 --> 1:09:23.736
- Yeah, she got it.

1:09:23.737 --> 1:09:25.138
- Oh, brilliant.

1:09:25.139 --> 1:09:27.241
- You'll be making
the tea from now on.

1:09:27.242 --> 1:09:28.680
- Oh will I, now?

1:09:30.149 --> 1:09:31.484
Know your place.

1:13:09.286 --> 1:13:10.719
- Mom, what's wrong?

1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:11.722
What's the matter?

1:13:14.262 --> 1:13:17.733
- It was walking across
the bed, it was on me!

1:13:17.734 --> 1:13:18.571
- What was?

1:13:24.216 --> 1:13:25.051
- Nothing.

1:13:26.086 --> 1:13:26.988
It was nothing.

1:13:29.626 --> 1:13:30.862
I'm so sorry.

1:13:50.468 --> 1:13:52.603
- What did you see, mom?

1:13:52.604 --> 1:13:55.009
What was your nightmare about?

1:13:55.010 --> 1:13:56.378
- It was silly.

1:13:56.379 --> 1:13:58.282
It was a nightmare I
used to have as a kid.

1:13:58.283 --> 1:13:59.986
You'd laugh if I told you.

1:14:00.888 --> 1:14:02.157
- I want to help you,

1:14:03.192 --> 1:14:04.595
but I don't know what to do.

1:14:05.697 --> 1:14:07.200
- I should see my doctor.

1:14:09.338 --> 1:14:10.607
I'm frightened.

1:14:12.177 --> 1:14:13.680
- We'll be here for you, okay?

1:14:14.847 --> 1:14:18.323
Whatever happens, we'll
get you through this.

1:14:38.496 --> 1:14:40.400
- Ah, for fuck's sakes.

1:14:43.339 --> 1:14:44.174
Oh!

1:14:45.276 --> 1:14:46.679
For fuck's sakes!

1:14:49.852 --> 1:14:52.289
No no.

1:14:52.290 --> 1:14:54.627
No, it's not that
sort of emergency.

1:14:56.332 --> 1:14:57.867
I've already explained.

1:14:57.868 --> 1:14:59.271
It's for my mom, not for me.

1:15:01.908 --> 1:15:03.212
That's the best you can do?

1:15:04.348 --> 1:15:05.183
Really?

1:15:06.452 --> 1:15:08.054
Yes.

1:15:08.055 --> 1:15:10.492
That's fine, yeah.

1:15:10.493 --> 1:15:11.328
Thank you.

1:15:17.374 --> 1:15:20.379
27th, 9:00 am.

1:15:20.380 --> 1:15:22.516
That's the earliest we can
get you an appointment.

1:15:22.517 --> 1:15:24.187
Two weeks.

1:15:24.188 --> 1:15:25.322
- It's fine.

1:15:25.323 --> 1:15:26.691
I can wait.

1:15:26.692 --> 1:15:28.929
- It doesn't look like
we've got much choice.

1:15:28.930 --> 1:15:30.933
Are you gonna be okay?

1:15:30.934 --> 1:15:32.903
- I'm not completely dotty yet.

1:15:32.904 --> 1:15:34.440
- Oh, well don't say that.

1:15:34.441 --> 1:15:36.911
- Well, you know what I mean.

1:15:39.151 --> 1:15:41.155
- Look, have some rest today.

1:15:43.025 --> 1:15:43.860
Love you.

1:15:45.497 --> 1:15:47.132
- Daft girl.

1:15:47.133 --> 1:15:48.236
I love you, too.

1:15:51.075 --> 1:15:52.910
- In a paper kit,

1:15:52.911 --> 1:15:55.716
going in and making
it different colors.

1:15:55.717 --> 1:15:58.054
And you know, even
though you've got that-

1:15:58.055 --> 1:15:59.557
- Fucking hell.

1:15:59.558 --> 1:16:00.627
Kill me now.

1:16:28.115 --> 1:16:29.650
Oh, what the hell?

1:16:29.651 --> 1:16:30.486
Oh, oh...

1:17:01.248 --> 1:17:02.084
Oh god!

1:17:04.788 --> 1:17:05.789
Hi, it's Sue.

1:17:05.790 --> 1:17:06.958
Leave a message.

1:17:06.959 --> 1:17:08.662
- Hi Sue, it's Beth.

1:17:08.663 --> 1:17:11.033
This is awful, I don't know
how I could've missed you.

1:17:11.034 --> 1:17:12.736
Please call me when
you get this message.

1:17:12.737 --> 1:17:14.307
Thanks, I'll try Jeff.

1:17:15.943 --> 1:17:17.513
- Hi, it's Jeff.
- Oh Jeff.

1:17:17.514 --> 1:17:18.848
Please leave a message.

1:17:18.849 --> 1:17:20.719
- I've just left a
message with Sue.

1:17:20.720 --> 1:17:22.823
I'm coming 'round in an Uber.

1:17:22.824 --> 1:17:24.193
Please, please call me.

1:17:24.194 --> 1:17:25.529
Lots of love, Beth.

1:17:25.530 --> 1:17:28.569
It's Beth!

1:17:36.251 --> 1:17:37.087
Hi, it's Sue.

1:17:37.088 --> 1:17:38.688
Leave a message.

1:17:38.689 --> 1:17:39.857
- Sue, it's Beth again.

1:17:39.858 --> 1:17:40.860
Please ring me.

1:17:57.826 --> 1:17:59.329
Not in.

1:17:59.330 --> 1:18:00.432
- Oh, hello.

1:18:01.300 --> 1:18:02.769
Do you know where they've gone?

1:18:02.770 --> 1:18:04.071
- I don't, sorry.

1:18:04.072 --> 1:18:06.276
I haven't seen them
since yesterday.

1:18:06.277 --> 1:18:07.512
- What?

1:18:07.513 --> 1:18:08.914
- Yeah, I've been
in all the time.

1:18:08.915 --> 1:18:11.586
They left around
12:00, half 12:00.

1:18:11.587 --> 1:18:13.124
Haven't been back since.

1:18:13.125 --> 1:18:14.826
Poor old George, bless him,
he's been barking all night.

1:18:14.827 --> 1:18:16.230
I was actually going
to go check in on him.

1:18:16.231 --> 1:18:17.965
- Have you got a key?

1:18:19.837 --> 1:18:22.142
Oh George, there you are.

1:18:22.143 --> 1:18:23.745
There's a good boy.

1:18:24.713 --> 1:18:28.787
Hello?

1:18:28.788 --> 1:18:29.923
Hello?

1:18:29.924 --> 1:18:31.426
- They're definitely not in.

1:18:31.427 --> 1:18:34.399
You can tell when
a house is empty.

1:18:34.400 --> 1:18:36.404
- What did you just say?

1:18:38.741 --> 1:18:41.814
- You can tell when
a house is empty?

1:18:43.384 --> 1:18:44.221
- Yes.

1:18:45.422 --> 1:18:46.424
Yes you can.

1:19:08.033 --> 1:19:09.270
- We were just...

1:19:09.271 --> 1:19:12.209
- You were just having
a conflab about me.

1:19:12.210 --> 1:19:14.946
You're worried
about me, I get it.

1:19:14.947 --> 1:19:18.787
- Beth, we were just
having some us time.

1:19:18.788 --> 1:19:20.358
- We need to talk.

1:19:20.359 --> 1:19:22.595
This is important.

1:19:22.596 --> 1:19:25.033
You think I'm in the
early stages of dementia.

1:19:25.034 --> 1:19:26.469
Well, I might be.

1:19:26.470 --> 1:19:28.274
That I probably am.

1:19:28.275 --> 1:19:30.878
I forget things,
I imagine things,

1:19:30.879 --> 1:19:32.782
but I'm not mad.

1:19:32.783 --> 1:19:35.689
I don't make you cups of tea
in the morning, I never have.

1:19:36.857 --> 1:19:38.727
Fruit bowls don't
smash by themselves

1:19:38.728 --> 1:19:41.200
and sweep up their shards.

1:19:41.201 --> 1:19:44.171
I found a piece of glass
on the kitchen floor.

1:19:44.172 --> 1:19:45.106
It cut me.

1:19:45.107 --> 1:19:46.977
I didn't imagine that.

1:19:46.978 --> 1:19:48.414
- Slow down!

1:19:48.415 --> 1:19:50.884
- Something very
strange is going on.

1:19:50.885 --> 1:19:53.657
Somebody's determined to
make me think I'm nuts.

1:19:53.658 --> 1:19:55.561
- Of course they are.
- Who?

1:19:55.562 --> 1:19:56.464
- I don't know.

1:19:56.465 --> 1:19:57.599
I haven't thought about it.

1:19:58.768 --> 1:20:01.105
Sue and Jeff are missing.
- What?

1:20:01.106 --> 1:20:03.944
- Yesterday, God, it must
have been when we were out.

1:20:03.945 --> 1:20:06.284
I found an envelope
with some money in it.

1:20:07.786 --> 1:20:11.125
They're repaying a loan
month by month, nevermind.

1:20:11.126 --> 1:20:13.630
Sue had written on
the envelope the date,

1:20:13.631 --> 1:20:15.468
and sorry to miss
you kind of thing.

1:20:15.469 --> 1:20:17.872
They haven't been
back home since.

1:20:17.873 --> 1:20:18.975
- What are you saying?

1:20:20.044 --> 1:20:21.579
Something's happened to them?
- Yes.

1:20:21.580 --> 1:20:24.819
No, I don't know, but
something weird is going on.

1:20:24.820 --> 1:20:27.123
They haven't been
back to their house.

1:20:27.124 --> 1:20:29.929
The dog was left
alone overnight.

1:20:29.930 --> 1:20:31.800
They love that dog, like a kid.

1:20:31.801 --> 1:20:33.202
- There could be any
number of reasons

1:20:33.203 --> 1:20:34.705
why that might have happened.

1:20:34.706 --> 1:20:36.576
- Yes, and none of them good.

1:20:36.577 --> 1:20:40.049
And Connor, I would never
just barge into your bedroom

1:20:40.050 --> 1:20:41.320
without your permission.

1:20:41.321 --> 1:20:43.824
Least of all to leave
you a cup of tea.

1:20:43.825 --> 1:20:46.128
Even if I was losing
it, I wouldn't do that.

1:20:46.129 --> 1:20:47.798
- So what are you saying?

1:20:47.799 --> 1:20:49.703
We've got a ghost Butler.

1:20:50.939 --> 1:20:53.243
- Hey, you can cut
the attitude, no.

1:20:54.813 --> 1:20:58.455
Something is going on.

1:21:14.487 --> 1:21:15.687
Hi, it's Sue.

1:21:15.688 --> 1:21:17.359
Leave a message.

1:21:53.830 --> 1:21:55.468
Night night.

1:22:41.493 --> 1:22:42.327
- Connor.

1:22:56.054 --> 1:22:56.923
- Ken, Ken!

1:23:02.200 --> 1:23:03.335
- Hello, sweetheart.

1:23:07.746 --> 1:23:09.080
Come back to bed.

1:23:10.149 --> 1:23:11.318
- Who the hell are you?

1:23:15.561 --> 1:23:17.397
- You know who I am.

1:23:26.683 --> 1:23:28.317
That's
the way to do it.

1:23:28.318 --> 1:23:30.322
That's the way to do it.

1:23:32.293 --> 1:23:33.797
That's the way to do it.

1:23:38.574 --> 1:23:41.579
That's the way to do it.

1:25:05.245 --> 1:25:07.818
Connor!

1:25:07.819 --> 1:25:11.592
- You're going to
miss the finale, Beth!

1:25:11.593 --> 1:25:12.425
- Where's your phone?

1:25:12.426 --> 1:25:13.696
- I left it in my room.

1:25:13.697 --> 1:25:15.365
We can't leave Connor!
- We have to!

1:25:15.366 --> 1:25:16.902
We need to get out of here.

1:25:16.903 --> 1:25:19.007
- Who are they, mom?
- I don't know!

1:25:19.008 --> 1:25:20.110
Where's the key?

1:25:21.478 --> 1:25:23.414
Where are you?

1:25:23.415 --> 1:25:26.487
He's coming, Beth!

1:28:57.142 --> 1:28:57.977
- Hey.

1:29:00.714 --> 1:29:01.885
Rectal reject.

1:29:48.677 --> 1:29:51.851
- That's the way to
do it, Mr. Punch.

1:29:54.322 --> 1:29:56.826
Isn't that right, Beth?

1:29:56.827 --> 1:29:58.831
That's the way to do it.

1:32:03.847 --> 1:32:05.450
- Listen to me.

1:32:07.922 --> 1:32:10.026
Just run, don't worry about me.

1:32:10.027 --> 1:32:11.862
I won't be far behind you.

1:32:13.133 --> 1:32:15.169
Get to Frank's
farm, call for help.

1:32:15.170 --> 1:32:16.438
- I'm not leaving without you.

1:32:16.439 --> 1:32:20.547
I said go!

1:33:11.016 --> 1:33:14.220
Beth.

1:33:14.221 --> 1:33:15.058
Beth.

1:33:23.707 --> 1:33:25.377
- I'm ready for you.

1:34:07.094 --> 1:34:08.561
Who are you?

1:34:08.562 --> 1:34:09.831
- There once was a girl.

1:34:11.368 --> 1:34:12.203
- Called Maude.

1:34:24.059 --> 1:34:27.134
- There once was a
girl called Maude.

1:34:31.109 --> 1:34:33.312
Who picked up a
strange creature.

1:34:40.993 --> 1:34:42.630
And brought it to her home.

1:34:51.182 --> 1:34:54.454
You need to be strong
now, for our daughter.

1:34:56.391 --> 1:34:58.828
Open your eyes.

1:35:24.148 --> 1:35:29.158
Finally, you are awake.

1:35:34.467 --> 1:35:35.303
Beth.

1:35:36.872 --> 1:35:37.707
My Beth.

1:35:40.980 --> 1:35:41.815
See, Beth.

1:35:42.917 --> 1:35:43.785
See.

1:35:45.990 --> 1:35:46.825
Now,

1:35:48.196 --> 1:35:49.265
now we dance.

1:36:18.256 --> 1:36:19.823
That's
the way to do it.

1:36:25.068 --> 1:36:27.104
That's the way to do it.

1:36:27.105 --> 1:36:29.141
That's the way to do it.

1:36:32.115 --> 1:36:36.725
No, no!

1:36:46.312 --> 1:36:48.714
That's
the way to do it.

1:36:51.186 --> 1:36:53.190
That's the way to do it.

1:36:57.300 --> 1:36:59.237
That's the way to do it.

1:36:59.238 --> 1:37:01.242
That's the way to do it.

1:37:09.657 --> 1:37:11.461
That's the way to do it.

1:37:11.462 --> 1:37:13.664
That's the way to do it.

1:37:21.748 --> 1:37:23.485
That's the way to do it.

1:37:23.486 --> 1:37:25.490
That's the way to do it.

1:37:30.300 --> 1:37:32.304
That's the way to do it.

1:38:10.110 --> 1:38:12.014
- Nice work, Mr. Punch.

1:38:37.466 --> 1:38:38.368
- Surprise!

1:38:39.537 --> 1:38:41.204
Oh!

1:38:41.205 --> 1:38:44.311
- You have front row tickets.

1:38:45.682 --> 1:38:47.017
- Why are you doing this?

1:38:48.821 --> 1:38:53.061
Now Beth.

1:38:53.062 --> 1:38:56.803
Don't you just love the
randomness of it all?

1:38:58.106 --> 1:39:00.746
We did all this for you.

1:39:02.383 --> 1:39:06.221
We've listened to everything.

1:39:06.222 --> 1:39:08.058
- You like dragons.

1:39:08.059 --> 1:39:10.229
- I don't think we're
supposed to like dragons.

1:39:10.230 --> 1:39:11.065
- So lost.

1:39:13.638 --> 1:39:18.145
So perfect.

1:39:18.146 --> 1:39:21.285
The one we had always
been looking for.

1:39:23.289 --> 1:39:25.729
The raw material that artists

1:39:26.897 --> 1:39:29.804
can only hope for
once in a lifetime.

1:39:32.074 --> 1:39:33.242
You see, Beth.

1:39:35.381 --> 1:39:37.653
We did all of this for you.

1:39:40.759 --> 1:39:41.594
You, Beth.

1:39:45.066 --> 1:39:47.070
You are our masterpiece!

1:40:11.218 --> 1:40:12.053
Now.

1:40:16.864 --> 1:40:21.874
Smile for the audience.

1:40:33.631 --> 1:40:34.800
Take your bow.

1:40:56.878 --> 1:40:59.046
- It's alright, love.

1:40:59.047 --> 1:41:00.484
Let go.

1:41:00.485 --> 1:41:02.353
You don't have to see this.

1:41:02.354 --> 1:41:03.825
Let go, come home.

1:41:17.417 --> 1:41:21.025
Beth.

1:41:21.026 --> 1:41:23.698
- And now, for the grand finale.

1:41:48.915 --> 1:41:50.818
- Please don't do this.

1:42:08.587 --> 1:42:12.827
No!

1:42:37.010 --> 1:42:37.845
- Yes.

1:42:47.932 --> 1:42:48.767
Yes.

1:43:05.066 --> 1:43:06.836
- Remember that Summer, Beth.

1:44:11.766 --> 1:44:12.599
- Poof.

1:44:14.371 --> 1:44:15.339
And she's gone.

1:44:18.847 --> 1:44:19.647
Truly,

1:44:21.651 --> 1:44:22.486
beautiful.
