* CUE THE PULSE
TO BEGIN *

00:53.321 --> 00:56.657
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

[I'll Be Your Man plays]

01:38.566 --> 01:41.369
- I KNOW EVERYBODY SAYS TUSCANY,
BUT THE AMALFI COAST...

01:41.402 --> 01:43.404
- HMM, POSITANO, RAVELLO...
- OH, MY GOD.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.506
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACE
I'VE EVER SEEN.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.208
- AND NOT TO MENTION
THE MEN.

01:47.241 --> 01:48.676
- [chuckling]
- NO, LET'S MENTION THE MEN.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.144
- I MEAN,
IS THERE ANY ITALIAN

01:50.178 --> 01:51.879
WITH LESS THAN AN 8-INCH COCK?

01:51.912 --> 01:53.514
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU GUYS
BEEN TOGETHER?

01:53.547 --> 01:55.216
- FOUR WEEKS.
- FOUR YEARS.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.251
- YOU GUYS GOTTA GET
YOUR STORY STRAIGHT.

01:57.285 --> 01:58.652
- IT'S COMPLICATED.
- OBVIOUSLY.

01:58.686 --> 02:01.489
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- GOING ON TEN YEARS.

02:01.522 --> 02:04.258
- SHIT. THAT'S AMAZING.
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

02:04.292 --> 02:05.626
- I'M NOT SURE
I WANT TO HEAR THIS.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.795
- COMMUNICATION.
- HONESTY.

02:07.828 --> 02:10.231
- RESPECT.
- AND A LOT OF FUCKING AROUND.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.166
- A COUPLE THAT PLAYS TOGETHER
STAYS TOGETHER.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.901
- THAT'S WHAT
I'VE ALWAYS SAID.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.903
NOTHING WILL KILL A MARRIAGE
FASTER THAN MONOGAMY.

02:15.936 --> 02:17.905
- YEAH, I TRIED THAT
FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS.

02:17.938 --> 02:19.240
- NEARLY SPLIT US UP.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.774
HE STARTED LYING,
SNEAKING AROUND.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.643
- HE CAUGHT ME
FUCKING THE NEIGHBOR.

02:22.676 --> 02:23.944
- BUT INSTEAD
OF KICKING HIM OUT, I THOUGHT,

02:23.977 --> 02:26.247
"THIS GUY'S HOT,"
SO I JOINED THEM.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.915
- SOLVED ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS.

02:27.948 --> 02:30.251
- IN THESE SORRY TIMES
OF FAGGOTS HURLING THEMSELVES

02:30.284 --> 02:32.186
LIKE LEMMINGS INTO THE SEA
OF MATRIMONY,

02:32.220 --> 02:35.456
IT'S REFRESHING TO FIND
A COUPLE WHO ARE HUNG

02:35.489 --> 02:37.858
BUT NOT HUNG UP.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.861
- SO HOW ABOUT WE
HOOK UP AGAIN?

02:40.894 --> 02:45.666
- WE HAVE A STRICT RULE
NOT TO SEE ANYONE TWICE.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.636
BUT SINCE THERE
ARE TWO OF YOU...

02:50.638 --> 02:52.840
[door closes]

03:02.616 --> 03:04.318
[Jenny cooing]

03:18.799 --> 03:20.434
- [exhales]

03:20.468 --> 03:23.704
- * WHO KNOWS
WHAT TOMORROW WILL BRING *

03:23.737 --> 03:27.308
* MAYBE SUNSHINE
AND MAYBE RAIN *

03:27.341 --> 03:29.310
- OKAY, I AM
A LOWLY WRITER-PROFESSOR,

03:29.343 --> 03:31.312
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES,
NOT AN M.I.T. GRADUATE.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.846
YOU NEED
AN ADVANCED DEGREE

03:32.880 --> 03:34.648
TO PUT
THIS FUCKING CRIB TOGETHER.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.317
- YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO WATCH

03:36.350 --> 03:39.253
THAT POTTY MOUTH OF YOURS
ONCE J.R. ARRIVES.

03:39.287 --> 03:40.854
IT'S OFFICIAL.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.523
ACCORDING TO THE STATE
OF PENNSYLVANIA,

03:42.556 --> 03:44.325
I NOW HAVE 1/3 CUSTODY
OF MY DAUGHTER.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.727
- OH, CONGRATULATIONS.
OH.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.596
- [chuckles]

03:48.629 --> 03:51.632
COULD'VE HAD MORE IF BRIAN
HADN'T STUCK HIS NOSE IN.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.734
- HEY, HEY,
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.

03:53.767 --> 03:57.004
- HE'S THE ONE WHO CONVINCED
LINDSAY TO FIGHT FOR CUSTODY.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.739
HE PAID
FOR HER GODDAMN LAWYER.

03:58.772 --> 03:59.807
- WELL,
SHE'S J.R.'S MOTHER TOO.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.941
IT'S ONLY FAIR.

04:00.974 --> 04:03.644
- [sighs]
I SUPPOSE.

04:03.677 --> 04:06.714
SO NOW WE GET TO SPLIT
A BABY THREE WAYS.

04:09.317 --> 04:11.352
- YOU KNOW, AS LONG
AS SHE'S LOVED AND CARED FOR,

04:11.385 --> 04:14.388
I'M SURE
IT'LL ALL WORK OUT.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.924
WOULD YOU HELP ME
PUT THIS THING TOGETHER

04:16.957 --> 04:19.793
BEFORE I LOSE
MY FUCKING--

04:21.395 --> 04:24.532
YES.
BEFORE I LOSE MY MIND.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.534
- YOUR EGGS ARE UP.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.370
WHEAT OR RYE?
BUTTERED OR DRY?

04:29.403 --> 04:31.505
- UH, RYE, DRY.
- RYE, DRY.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.575
- SWEETHEART.
- YEAH, HON.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.544
- WILL YOU SIT DOWN, PLEASE?

04:36.577 --> 04:39.813
STOP WAITING ON ME
LIKE I WAS IN THE DINER?

04:39.847 --> 04:41.815
- I GUESS OLD HABITS
DIE HARD.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.718
YOU WANTED, UH,
BACON, EXTRA CRISPY.

04:44.752 --> 04:47.087
- IF YOU DON'T STOP...
- [chuckling]

04:47.120 --> 04:48.656
- I'M NOT LEAVING YOU
A TIP.

04:48.689 --> 04:51.792
- OH, AND I WAS COUNTING
ON A BIG ONE TONIGHT.

04:51.825 --> 04:55.396
- HONEY, YOU'RE GETTING
MORE THAN JUST THE TIP.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.664
[laughter]

04:56.697 --> 04:59.066
- WHY, CARL HORVATH.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.734
- THE MORE I'M AROUND YOU,

05:00.768 --> 05:04.538
THE MORE I CAN'T KEEP
MY HANDS OFF YOU.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.407
YOU'RE NOT BORED,
ARE YOU?

05:06.440 --> 05:08.476
- OF FUCKING OUR BRAINS OUT?

05:08.509 --> 05:09.810
- NO. NOT WORKING.

05:09.843 --> 05:13.414
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

05:13.447 --> 05:16.417
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I WAITED SO LONG.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.420
I FINALLY HAVE
MY LIFE ALL TO MYSELF.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.622
- SO WHAT'S
ON OUR LADY OF LEISURE'S AGENDA

05:21.655 --> 05:22.723
FOR TODAY?

05:22.756 --> 05:26.560
- OH, A MATINEE,
A PINTER PLAY.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.629
PERHAPS A PIECE
OF MAHLER.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.998
- PIECE OF WHAT?
- [laughing]

05:31.031 --> 05:32.700
THANK GOD
HANGING AROUND LIBERTY AVENUE

05:32.733 --> 05:35.102
MADE YOU A SEX MANIAC
AND NOT A SHOW-TUNE QUEEN.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.605
[laughter]

05:37.638 --> 05:40.874
UM, I'M GOING TO GO
BUY SOME PAJAMAS.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.576
ALL OF MINE
SEEM TO BE DISAPPEARING.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.978
- THAT'S BECAUSE I TOOK THEM.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.980
- I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

05:47.014 --> 05:50.618
IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE--
A CROSS-DRESSER!

05:50.651 --> 05:52.653
- YOU'RE SEXIER WITHOUT THEM.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.121
- WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS IS, DON'T YOU?

05:54.154 --> 05:55.889
IT IS
GRAND THEFT PAJAMAS.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.991
I COULD HAVE YOU
ARRESTED.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.927
BUT...

05:59.960 --> 06:02.362
I PREFER TO HAVE YOU
WORK IT OFF.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.502
- MORNING, BRIAN.

06:08.536 --> 06:09.903
I GOT THOSE FILES
WE TALKED ABOUT.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.873
THE GERBER ACCOUNTS,
THE GREENWALD ACCOUNTS,

06:12.906 --> 06:15.042
AND PAYROLL.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.144
YEAH, I WAS UP TILL,
OH, 1:00 IN THE MORNING,

06:17.177 --> 06:19.480
BUT I GOT EVERYTHING
ALL SIGNED AND SEALED.

06:19.513 --> 06:22.082
HUH, NOW THERE'S
REALLY NOTHING LEFT TO DO

06:22.115 --> 06:24.051
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
I'M, UH...

06:24.084 --> 06:25.753
I'M KIND OF
FREE AS A BIRD.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.087
[chuckles]

06:28.789 --> 06:30.624
LISTEN, UH...
[clears throat]

06:30.658 --> 06:33.060
I NEED TO TAKE
A LITTLE TIME OFF.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.195
- VACATION?
- NAH.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.897
- SABBATICAL?
- NAH.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.432
- DRUG BINGE?
- [chuckles]

06:38.466 --> 06:40.801
A-A SMALL
MEDICAL PROCEDURE.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.636
- FINALLY GETTING
THAT PENILE ENLARGEMENT?

06:42.670 --> 06:44.772
[laughter]

06:44.805 --> 06:47.074
WHEN ARE YOU LEAVING?
- TOMORROW.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.677
I KNOW IT'S SHORT NOTICE,
BUT THEY HAD A CANCELLATION.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.445
THEY SAID
THEY COULD FIT ME IN.

06:51.479 --> 06:52.646
BUT, LOOK,
I'LL BE BACK IN A WEEK.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.915
TEN DAYS, TOPS.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.050
- SO WHAT ARE YOU
HAVING DONE?

06:57.084 --> 07:00.688
- WHAT--WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'M HAVING ANYTHING DONE?

07:00.721 --> 07:02.556
- OH, THE ENDLESS HOURS
YOU SPEND

07:02.590 --> 07:06.159
PULLING YOUR FACE BACK,
SMOOTHING YOUR STOMACH.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.531
SPILL.

07:10.564 --> 07:13.834
- OH, YOU KNOW,
NOTHING MAJOR.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.537
BROW LIFT, BLEPHAROPLASTY
ON MY UPPER AND LOWER EYELIDS,

07:16.570 --> 07:18.472
PRECISION CONTOUR
LIPOSUCTION ON MY GUT.

07:18.506 --> 07:19.673
[muttering]

07:19.707 --> 07:22.075
- WHAT PRICE BEAUTY?
[scoffs]

07:22.109 --> 07:23.844
- IT AIN'T CHEAP.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.246
HOWEVER, UH, THEY ARE
SUCKING MY CHIN OUT FOR FREE.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.215
- OH!

07:28.248 --> 07:29.617
[laughs]

07:29.650 --> 07:31.084
OH, THE WAY GAY MEN

07:31.118 --> 07:33.120
ARE OBSESSED
WITH YOUTH AND BEAUTY.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.822
AN ENTIRE SUBCULTURE
CONVINCED

07:34.855 --> 07:37.157
THAT THE MEANING OF HAPPINESS
IS NO LOVE HANDLES.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.560
HOW PATHETIC.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.495
HOW TRAGIC.

07:41.529 --> 07:42.863
HOW PROFITABLE.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.231
- [sighs]
GO AHEAD,

07:44.264 --> 07:46.166
MOCK MY ENDEAVOURS
AT SELF-IMPROVEMENT.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.168
BUT, YOU KNOW, NOT ALL OF US
ARE AS LUCKY AS YOU.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.003
WE ALL CAN'T BE
BRIAN KINNEY.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.972
THE REST OF US POOR SCHLUBS,
WE HAVE TO WORK TWICE AS HARD

07:52.005 --> 07:53.774
TO LOOK HALF AS GOOD.
- I'M SORRY, THEODORE.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.043
I DON'T MEAN TO IMPUGN
YOUR NOBLE EFFORTS.

07:56.076 --> 07:59.112
I JUST THINK
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE...

07:59.146 --> 08:01.782
NOT GETTING
THAT PENILE ENLARGEMENT.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.117
- [sighs]

08:04.151 --> 08:07.888
- OH, SHE'S SO ADORABLE.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.189
CAN I TAKE HER HOME?

08:09.222 --> 08:12.025
- SURE. WHY NOT?
EVERYBODY ELSE IS.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.127
[door opens]

08:14.161 --> 08:16.263
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD A GUEST.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.932
- HUH.
JUSTIN'S NOT A GUEST.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.668
AND DIDN'T WE AGREE
YOU'RE GOING TO RING THE BELL,

08:20.701 --> 08:21.769
NOT JUST POP IN?

08:21.802 --> 08:23.771
- HEY, LINDSAY.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.874
MM.
- HELLO, JUSTIN.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.142
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN BACK FROM L.A.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.744
- I KNOW.
I WAS PLANNING ON CALLING,

08:30.778 --> 08:33.046
BUT I DON'T HAVE
YOUR NEW NUMBER.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.183
- I'M SURE BRIAN
COULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU.

08:36.216 --> 08:39.186
- UM, SO HOW'S GUS?

08:39.219 --> 08:42.956
- GUS IS DOING GREAT.
HE'S GROWING AS WE SPEAK.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.692
HE'S EVEN STARTED TO READ.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.160
- OH, YOU GO AWAY
FOR A FEW MONTHS,

08:47.194 --> 08:49.630
AND EVERYTHING CHANGES.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.799
- NO SHIT.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.768
- I HAVE FALLEN HOPELESSLY
IN LOVE WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.336
- SHE'S PRETTY IRRESISTIBLE.
- YEAH.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.205
- OH, I FOUND THIS
FLEECE SLEEPER FOR THE BABY.

08:58.238 --> 09:01.308
IT'S STARTING TO GET CHILLY.
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.810
- I GOT THREE--
ONE FOR YOU, ONE FOR ME,

09:02.843 --> 09:03.811
AND ONE
FOR WHEN SHE'S WITH MICHAEL.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.312
- YOU HAVE TO REMIND ME?

09:05.345 --> 09:07.848
- WE ALL HAVE TO MAKE SURE
SHE'S TAKEN CARE OF.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.717
- WELL, YOU'VE SEEN TO THAT.
THANKS TO YOU,

09:09.750 --> 09:11.852
I HAVE TO HAND MY DAUGHTER
OVER TO SOME STRANGER.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.320
- MICHAEL'S HARDLY
A STRANGER.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.955
- OH, HE MIGHT AS WELL BE.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.724
WHAT DOES HE KNOW
ABOUT TAKING CARE OF AN INFANT?

09:16.757 --> 09:18.058
SHE SHOULD BE WITH ME
INSTEAD OF BEING

09:18.091 --> 09:19.860
TOSSED AROUND
LIKE A FUCKING FOOTBALL.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.662
- MAYBE I BETTER GO.
- NO. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TEA,

09:21.695 --> 09:23.063
GOD DAMN IT.
- I'LL GET IT.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.832
- YOU DON'T LIVE HERE
ANYMORE, REMEMBER?

09:24.865 --> 09:26.667
- OF COURSE. HOW COULD I FORGET?
- YEAH, WELL,

09:26.700 --> 09:28.201
IF YOU WOULD HAVE LISTENED TO ME
AND DONE WHAT I SAID,

09:28.235 --> 09:29.369
WE WOULDN'T BE PLAYING
THIS GAME OF "BABY, BABY,

09:29.402 --> 09:32.940
WHO'S GOT THE BABY?"

09:32.973 --> 09:35.142
- THAT'S WHAT'S KILLING YOU,
ISN'T IT?

09:35.175 --> 09:36.744
IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE BABY

09:36.777 --> 09:38.078
OR THE CUSTODY AGREEMENT.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.347
IT HAS TO DO WITH YOU,
MELANIE MARCUS,

09:40.380 --> 09:41.882
NOT GETTING HER WAY,

09:41.915 --> 09:43.884
NOT HAVING COMPLETE CONTROL
OVER EVERYTHING.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.186
WELL, TOUGH SHIT.
YOU DON'T.

09:48.388 --> 09:51.091
SO GET USED TO IT.
[kettle whistling]

09:51.124 --> 09:53.994
- UM, I'LL GET THE TEA.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.368
- DIG!

10:01.401 --> 10:03.270
DIG. COME ON, PULL.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.740
FINISH IT OFF.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.645
- HOW'D I DO?
- 2/10 OF A SECOND

10:11.679 --> 10:13.313
OFF YOUR PERSONAL BEST.
- FUCKING "A"!

10:13.346 --> 10:15.182
IT'S 'CAUSE I'M NAILING
THOSE FLIP TURNS.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.416
- BET YOU 10 BUCKS
YOU'LL PLACE.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.251
- THINK SO?
- KNOW SO.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.921
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
LET'S GATHER UP, LET'S GO.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.323
GOOD PRACTICE.
VERY GOOD.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.992
YOU SWIM THIS HARD
IN TWO DAYS,

10:25.025 --> 10:26.927
AND WE'LL HOLD
OUR HEADS HIGH AT THE MEET.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.730
NOW, GO GET A GOOD MEAL,
GET SOME SLEEP,

10:29.763 --> 10:31.999
AND DON'T STRAIN ANYTHING.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.166
ARE YOU WINNERS?
all: YEAH.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.935
- I ASKED YOU,
ARE YOU WINNERS?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.770
all: YEAH!
- THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

10:36.804 --> 10:39.206
AND PUT AWAY THE TOYS
BEFORE YOU SCRUB DOWN.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.208
YEAH, I GOT TO SAY,
AT FIRST I HAD MY DOUBTS,

10:41.241 --> 10:42.442
BUT HUNTER'S COMING
THROUGH GANGBUSTERS.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.044
- AW, I ALWAYS KNEW
HE COULD DO IT.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.779
HE JUST NEEDED
SOME INCENTIVE, SOME SUPPORT...

10:45.813 --> 10:47.414
FRIENDS.
- AND HAVING A PARENT

10:47.447 --> 10:49.082
THAT'S WILLING TO TAKE
THE TIME TO WORK WITH HIM.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.351
- HMM. THANKS.
APPRECIATE IT, COACH.

10:51.384 --> 10:52.786
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE MEET.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.054
[overlapping chatter]

10:54.087 --> 10:55.789
- NICE TRY.
I'LL GET YOU SOON, MAN.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.925
- HE'LL CATCH YOU...
- YEAH, RIGHT, NEXT TIME.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.960
- YOU'LL BE LICKING MY TOES.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.428
- GOOD SWIM.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.864
- YEAH. THANKS.
YOU TOO.

11:06.934 --> 11:10.838
- YO, HUNT, YOU COMING?
- YEAH.

11:10.871 --> 11:13.306
- HEY, HUNTER, WE'RE GOING.
- WAIT UP.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.242
[indistinct chatter]
- CALLIE...

11:15.275 --> 11:17.210
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU THINK
MY GETTING A LITTLE WORK DONE

11:17.244 --> 11:20.113
IS A FRIVOLOUS EXPENSE,
A FOOLISH EXERCISE IN VANITY.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.949
HOWEVER--
- I JUST HAD

11:21.982 --> 11:24.317
THE MOST FABULOUS IDEA
FOR MY NEXT SEGMENT.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.854
THE QUEER GUY FOLLOWS YOU

11:26.887 --> 11:28.822
THROUGH YOUR ENTIRE SURGERY.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.357
EVERY LITTLE SNIP AND CLIP.

11:30.390 --> 11:34.795
THEN I BRING YOU ON MY SHOW

11:34.828 --> 11:37.697
FOR THE BIG REVEAL.

11:39.833 --> 11:44.838
OR I GO WITH
MY AVOCADO NIGHT-REPAIR MASK

11:44.872 --> 11:46.273
AS PLANNED.

11:46.306 --> 11:49.342
- STICK WITH THE GUACAMOLE.
- [clicks tongue]

11:49.376 --> 11:51.278
- BUT PROMISE ME,
NO MATTER HOW I COME OUT,

11:51.311 --> 11:52.946
YOU'LL STILL LOVE ME.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.247
- HONEY, I NEVER LOVED YOU

11:54.281 --> 11:55.883
FOR YOUR LOOKS
TO BEGIN WITH.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.285
NOT THAT THERE'S A DAMN THING
WRONG WITH THEM.

11:58.318 --> 11:59.820
- OH.
BUT IF THIS IS WHAT

11:59.853 --> 12:01.354
YOU WANT TO DO,
THEN I'M BEHIND YOU.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.958
- AND DID I MENTION
I'M GETTING THAT DONE TOO?

12:04.992 --> 12:07.861
- MAKE ROOM, BOYS.
- AH, LITTLE DEBBIE!

12:07.895 --> 12:10.163
- YOU'VE COME HOME.
- YEAH, JUST LIKE A BOOMERANG,

12:10.197 --> 12:12.099
OR LASSIE.
HA HA.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.001
- IT'S JUST LIKE NORMA DESMOND,
MAKING HER COMEBACK.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.836
- I BELIEVE
IT WAS A RETURN.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.137
- OH, I WAS JUST PASSING BY,

12:17.170 --> 12:18.371
SO I THOUGHT
I'D POKE MY HEAD IN

12:18.405 --> 12:19.539
AND SEE HOW
THINGS ARE GOING.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.909
- OH, THINGS ARE GOING GREAT.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.844
- YEAH?

12:23.877 --> 12:25.445
- I MEAN...YOU KNOW,

12:25.478 --> 12:27.380
IT SURE ISN'T
THE SAME WITHOUT YOU.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.249
- OH.
- UH, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

12:29.282 --> 12:31.852
- WELL,
SINCE I'VE STOPPED WORKING,

12:31.885 --> 12:34.554
CARL AND I ARE GETTING
PLENTY OF EXERCISE,

12:34.587 --> 12:36.056
IF YOU GET MY DRIFT.

12:36.089 --> 12:39.026
- YEAH, IT DRIFTS
ALL THE WAY TO MY ROOM.

12:39.059 --> 12:42.095
- SO I BOUGHT MYSELF
A NEW WARM-UP SUIT.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.133
- YEAH, THAT'LL WARM HIM UP,
ALL RIGHT.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.868
- DEAR GOD,

12:47.901 --> 12:51.038
IT'S LIKE A GLORY HOLE
FOR STRAIGHTS.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.339
[laughter]

12:52.372 --> 12:53.941
- OKAY, HERE YOU GO, BOYS.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.575
HEY, DEB.
WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

12:55.608 --> 12:58.445
- I--
A...COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.013
HI, LORETTA.
I-I JUST...

13:00.047 --> 13:01.414
I JUST STOPPED BY TO SEE--
- EXCUSE ME.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.083
HOLD THAT THOUGHT
FOR ONE SECOND.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.152
SPINACH SALAD, DRESSING
ON THE SIDE FOR THE QUEER GUY.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.054
CHILI CHEESE FRIES
AND A VANILLA SHAKE

13:07.087 --> 13:09.022
FOR THE TEDDY BEAR.
- THANKS, LOVE.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.824
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU SHOULD BE EATING ALL THAT?

13:10.858 --> 13:13.493
- HEY, WHAT GOES IN TODAY
GETS SUCKED OUT TOMORROW.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.963
- OH, I'M SORRY, DEB,
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?

13:15.996 --> 13:17.430
- YEAH, I WAS JUST ASKING,
YOU KNOW,

13:17.464 --> 13:18.899
HOW THINGS WERE GOING.

13:18.932 --> 13:21.034
- HEY, LORETTA,
YOU GOT ANY EQUAL?

13:21.068 --> 13:24.437
- YEAH. WONDER WOMAN.
[laughter]

13:24.471 --> 13:26.840
I'M DOING FUCKING GREAT.
- SHE'S DOING FUCKING GREAT.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.375
- IN FACT, IF I DIDN'T KNOW
ANY BETTER,

13:28.408 --> 13:30.077
I'D SWEAR IT WAS YOU.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.512
- YEAH. ME TOO.
- SO WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

13:32.545 --> 13:35.582
PINK PLATE SPECIAL TODAY
IS CODFISH BALLS.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.117
WHAT'D THEY DO
WITH THE REST OF THE CODFISH?

13:37.150 --> 13:41.521
[laughter]

13:41.554 --> 13:43.924
- UM, I'LL HAVE
A BOWL OF PEA SOUP.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.092
AND PLEASE DON'T
TELL ME THAT--

13:45.125 --> 13:46.593
- PETE PISSED IN IT.

13:46.626 --> 13:49.229
- HEY, LO.
WHERE'S MY TUNA WRAP?

13:49.262 --> 13:52.065
- ANY GUY EATING TUNA HERE
IS IN THE WRONG JOINT.

13:52.099 --> 13:53.867
I'LL BRING YOU
CHICKEN NOODLE.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.336
[both chuckling]

13:56.369 --> 13:58.138
- OH, SHE'S A HOOT,
ISN'T SHE?

13:58.171 --> 14:01.141
- [chuckling]
YEAH.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.043
HOOT AND A HALF.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.014
- SO HOW WAS REHEARSAL?

14:07.047 --> 14:08.548
- OH, IT'S CALLED PRACTICE.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.250
- RIGHT.
- I KEPT MY KICK DOWN.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.352
- AND HIS HEAD UP.
- AND I BEAT MY BEST TIME

14:12.385 --> 14:13.954
BY 2/10 OF A SECOND.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.488
- THAT'S AWESOME, DUDE.
RIGHT ON.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.957
WELL, I CAN'T WAIT TO COME
TO THE PERFORMANCE.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.525
I'LL BE THERE,
FRONT ROW CENTER.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.560
- IT'S A MEET.
AND THEY'RE CALLED BLEACHERS.

14:20.593 --> 14:21.962
- YEAH.
- HEY, UP TILL NOW,

14:21.995 --> 14:23.430
ALL I KNEW ABOUT SWIMMING

14:23.463 --> 14:25.298
WAS FROM WATCHING
ESTHER WILLIAMS FILMS WITH MA.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.167
DID YOU EVER SEE THE ONE WHERE
SHE RISES UP OUT OF THE WATER

14:27.200 --> 14:28.535
WITH THE SPARKLERS
COMING OUT OF HER HEAD?

14:28.568 --> 14:30.537
- HEY, BOYS.
- HEY, BRIAN.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.805
COME ON, PAL, LET'S GO CARB UP.
[mouthing]

14:36.676 --> 14:39.012
- DO YOU MIND
IF I PUT THIS UP?

14:41.014 --> 14:42.515
- "HARD HEROES NIGHT"?

14:42.549 --> 14:45.518
- EVERY SUPERHERO FANTASY
YOU EVER HAD

14:45.552 --> 14:48.155
COME TRUE.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.023
- WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I'M NOT SURE IT'S APPROPRIATE

14:50.057 --> 14:51.424
FOR MY YOUNGER CLIENTELE.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.560
- WELL, IF YOUR YOUNGER
CLIENTELE'S DROOLING

14:53.593 --> 14:55.262
OVER THOSE BULGING BICEPS

14:55.295 --> 14:57.264
AND BOUNTIFUL BASKETS
THE WAY YOU DID,

14:57.297 --> 14:59.266
THEY'RE GOING TO GROW UP
TO BE FAGS ANYWAY.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.301
SO...WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

15:01.334 --> 15:03.203
- YEAH, OKAY.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.342
- I EXPECT YOU
TO BE THERE.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.544
- DON'T THINK SO.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.313
WHAT WITH WORK
AND FIXING UP THE HOUSE,

15:13.346 --> 15:15.182
THESE DAYS,
WE GET TO BED PRETTY EARLY.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.584
- IT'S SUPERHEROES, MIKEY.

15:19.586 --> 15:23.456
IT'S SUPERMAN-ON-SUPERMAN
ACTION.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.695
- I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.297
I'LL COME CHECK OUT
YOUR NEW PLACE

15:30.330 --> 15:31.631
IF YOU COME
CHECK OUT OURS.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.466
- MM.
TCH.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.336
JUST LIKE WHEN WE SHOWED
EACH OTHER OUR DICKS.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.105
DEAL.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.739
- BEN AND I ARE HAVING
OUR NEW NEIGHBORS OVER

15:39.772 --> 15:41.308
FOR DINNER TOMORROW.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.243
WHY DON'T YOU
AND JUSTIN JOIN US?

15:43.276 --> 15:47.447
- UM...FABULOUS.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.715
I'LL BRING A BOTTLE.

15:48.748 --> 15:49.716
- RED WOULD BE NICE.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.685
- I MEANT POPPERS.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.190
[door opens,
bells jingle]

15:57.224 --> 15:58.191
[door closes]

15:58.225 --> 16:00.127
- INTERESTING.

16:00.160 --> 16:04.064
NOT BAD. HMM.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.333
THIS ONE IS INTRIGUING.

16:06.366 --> 16:07.734
I'D ALWAYS RESPONDED
TO THE RAW,

16:07.767 --> 16:11.104
UNFINISHED QUALITY
OF YOUR WORK.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.639
- IS THAT A COMPLIMENT,

16:12.672 --> 16:14.474
OR ARE YOU
LETTING ME DOWN EASY?

16:14.507 --> 16:15.775
- WELL, IF YOU'RE ASKING ME
IF I'D CONSIDER YOU

16:15.808 --> 16:18.211
FOR THE EMERGING
ARTISTS SHOW,

16:18.245 --> 16:19.746
THE ANSWER IS YES.

16:19.779 --> 16:23.683
- OH, THANKS, LINZ.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.019
BUT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF OUR FRIENDSHIP.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.687
- I DON'T CONSIDER IT
BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF,

16:27.720 --> 16:29.656
PROVIDED THE WORK
IS GOOD...

16:31.424 --> 16:33.093
AND THAT
WE'RE STILL FRIENDS.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.627
- WHY WOULDN'T WE BE?

16:34.661 --> 16:37.530
- OFTENTIMES
WHEN COUPLES BREAK UP,

16:37.564 --> 16:40.633
FRIENDS GRAVITATE
TOWARDS ONE PERSON OR THE OTHER.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.302
SO I WOULDN'T BE
SURPRISED OR HURT

16:42.335 --> 16:46.239
IF YOU DECIDED
TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS MEL.

16:46.273 --> 16:48.175
WELL...

16:50.177 --> 16:52.779
ACTUALLY, I WOULD.
- HMM.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.647
I COULD NEVER DO THAT.

16:54.681 --> 16:59.386
YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN...
WELL, MEL AND LINZ.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.388
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
WHEN I FIRST MET BRIAN,

17:01.421 --> 17:02.722
YOU TWO WERE THERE FOR ME.

17:02.755 --> 17:07.060
A SHOULDER TO CRY ON,
A COUCH TO SLEEP ON.

17:07.094 --> 17:10.063
I COULD NEVER TAKE SIDES.

17:10.097 --> 17:13.066
I LOVE YOU BOTH.

17:13.100 --> 17:17.170
- WELL, THERE'S ONE THING
MEL AND I STILL AGREE ON...

17:17.204 --> 17:20.173
IT'S THAT WE FEEL
THE SAME WAY ABOUT YOU.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.544
I'M JUST SORRY YOU HAD
TO WITNESS OUR PERFORMANCE.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.846
- OH, PLEASE.
BRIAN AND I HAVE HAD

17:26.879 --> 17:30.817
A COUPLE OF ACADEMY AWARD
WINNERS OURSELVES.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.419
SO...

17:32.452 --> 17:35.155
IS THERE ANY CHANCE
YOU AND MEL MIGHT...

17:35.188 --> 17:37.324
- GET BACK TOGETHER?

17:37.357 --> 17:39.726
I WAS HOPING AT FIRST
WE COULD.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.729
THAT WE'D MAKE UP
AND ALL WOULD BE FORGIVEN.

17:44.864 --> 17:48.435
BUT NOW...

17:48.468 --> 17:53.340
I GUESS YOU WOULD CALL THAT
MAGICAL THINKING.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.076
- OH, YOU NEVER KNOW.

17:59.779 --> 18:04.784
- WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD
DEFINITELY CONSIDER THIS ONE.

18:04.817 --> 18:07.187
THE EXUBERANCE.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.222
THE OPTIMISM.

18:12.392 --> 18:16.196
- YOU'RE GETTING AN 8 1/2,
A 10, AND A 13-INCH SKILLET.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.865
PLUS YOU'RE GETTING A WEIGHTED
PRESS THAT ALLOWS YOU...

18:18.898 --> 18:21.201
- I'M OFF TO MAKE SURE
THE SCHNAGELS ARE STILL ALIVE

18:21.234 --> 18:23.270
FOR THEIR 60TH
ANNIVERSARY PARTY.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.138
THEN TO THE STUDIO
FOR QUEER GUY.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.207
DON'T FORGET TO WATCH.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.409
- I'M WARMING UP THE SET.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.778
- LOOK AT YOU,
LOUNGING IN YOUR CAFTAN

18:31.811 --> 18:33.680
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE AFTERNOON.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.883
INSTEAD OF WALKING OFF
YOUR TIRED FEET AT THE DINER.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.518
- IT'S THE DREAM
OF A LIFETIME.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.653
- [chuckles]

18:40.687 --> 18:43.623
- YEAH, I'M HERE.
I WANT THE GRIDDLE.

18:43.656 --> 18:44.891
AND THAT LAST ITEM,

18:44.924 --> 18:47.360
THE--THE OLIVE...
THE OLIVE PITTER.

18:47.394 --> 18:50.263
AND I WANT THE CITRUS SLICER
AND THE--AND THE NUT CHOPPER.

18:50.297 --> 18:54.367
AND THROW IN THE DUTCH OVEN
AND THE CHEESE GRATER.

18:54.401 --> 18:55.902
- SO IT WORKS OUT VERY...

18:55.935 --> 18:59.639
- WOW, THAT--THAT HAUL
TOOK YOU LESS THAN 15 SECONDS.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.575
MUST BE A NEW RECORD.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.911
SO WHAT'S WRONG?

19:04.944 --> 19:07.247
- WHY SHOULD ANYTHING
BE WRONG?

19:07.280 --> 19:08.781
LIKE YOU SAID,
LOOK AT ME.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.451
I'M THE HAPPIEST WOMAN
IN THE WORLD.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.386
I'VE GOT ENDLESS HOURS
AT MY DISPOSAL,

19:13.420 --> 19:15.788
I CAN EAT ALL
THE FUCKING ICE CREAM I WANT,

19:15.822 --> 19:18.658
I CAN ORDER
TO MY HEART'S CONTENT ON QVC.

19:18.691 --> 19:21.394
I ALMOST ORDERED A LLAMA.

19:21.428 --> 19:24.531
SO WHY SHOULD
ANYTHING BE WRONG?

19:24.564 --> 19:26.333
EXCEPT THAT...

19:26.366 --> 19:28.468
BITCH STOLE MY ACT!

19:29.969 --> 19:31.471
- WHICH BITCH?

19:31.504 --> 19:32.872
- WHICH BITCH DO YOU THINK?

19:32.905 --> 19:35.408
TH-THAT PYE PERSON.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.944
SHE WAS SO INNOCENT
AT FIRST.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.479
"I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO ANYTHING.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.715
I DON'T HAVE
ANY EXPERIENCE."

19:42.749 --> 19:45.485
MAN.
SHE HUSTLED ME.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.354
SHE HUSTLED ME GOOD.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.289
AND--AND I FELL FOR IT!

19:49.322 --> 19:51.758
NOW SHE'S...
SHE'S WEARING MY T-SHIRTS

19:51.791 --> 19:54.727
AND MY VEST WITH MY BUTTONS.

19:58.398 --> 20:02.302
I SHOULD HAVE HER ARRESTED
FOR IDENTITY THEFT.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.371
- YOU KNOW...

20:04.404 --> 20:07.440
I THINK YOU'RE JUST HAVING
WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS,

20:07.474 --> 20:09.442
THAT'S ALL.

20:09.476 --> 20:11.378
REMEMBER,
YOU WANTED TO LEAVE.

20:11.411 --> 20:12.645
IT WAS YOUR DECISION.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.514
AND AS FOR LORETTA,

20:14.547 --> 20:18.318
SHE'S JUST CARRYING ON
YOUR LEGACY.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.587
KEEPING
THE TRADITION ALIVE.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.722
IF IT WERE ME, I'D CONSIDER IT
THE HIGHEST FORM OF FLATTERY.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.258
- OR THE LOWEST FORM
OF IMITATION.

20:25.292 --> 20:28.361
- DON'T BE ANGRY.
BE PROUD.

20:28.395 --> 20:31.864
PASS ON THE MANTLE
WITH DIGNITY.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.634
ALWAYS DIGNITY.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.038
AND DON'T ORDER A LLAMA.
I'M ALLERGIC.

20:39.071 --> 20:42.975
[TV hosts continue
in background]

20:49.549 --> 20:52.352
- DIGNITY.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.654
ALWAYS DIGNITY.

20:56.789 --> 21:00.393
[whipped cream whooshing]

21:02.795 --> 21:04.063
- IT'S AMAZING...

21:04.096 --> 21:05.498
- THAT I'VE BEEN
SOAPING YOUR CRACK

21:05.532 --> 21:07.400
FOR THE PAST TEN MINUTES

21:07.434 --> 21:10.437
AND YOU HAVEN'T
ASKED ME TO FUCK YOU?

21:10.470 --> 21:12.639
- THAT YOU AND I
WOULD BE TOGETHER

21:12.672 --> 21:14.774
AND MELANIE AND LINDSAY
WOULD BE APART.

21:14.807 --> 21:19.379
- WELL, WHO KNOWS WHAT WONDERS
THE FATES HAVE IN STORE.

21:19.412 --> 21:23.550
- I MEAN, IF THEY CAN'T
MAKE IT, WHO CAN?

21:23.583 --> 21:25.652
- DING, DING, DING, DING.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.987
THE CORRECT ANSWER IS:
NO ONE.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.789
- YEAH.
STOP BEING CYNICAL.

21:29.822 --> 21:33.393
- I'M NOT BEING CYNICAL,
I'M BEING...

21:33.426 --> 21:34.827
- REALISTIC.

21:34.861 --> 21:38.665
- DO YOU MIND
IF I FINISH MY OWN SENTENCES?

21:38.698 --> 21:40.533
I DESPISE
WHEN COUPLES DO THAT.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.068
- HA, DID YOU HEAR THAT,
RUBBER DUCKY?

21:42.101 --> 21:43.670
HE SAID "COUPLES."

21:43.703 --> 21:46.339
I SHOULD QUIT
WHILE I'M AHEAD.

21:46.373 --> 21:49.108
- BUT NOT
BEFORE YOU GIVE ME SOME...

21:49.141 --> 21:51.678
- MON AMOUR.
- "MON AMOUR."

21:51.711 --> 21:55.415
I LOVE HOW OTHER PEOPLE'S
TRAGIC MARITAL PLIGHT

21:55.448 --> 21:58.017
MAKES YOU ROMANTIC.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.586
- HARD.

21:59.619 --> 22:00.987
- CHRIST.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.689
WHAT A BIG BONER.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.090
- [laughs]

22:04.123 --> 22:06.493
ALL THE BETTER...
- TO FUCK ME WITH?

22:06.526 --> 22:08.495
- WHAT DID I JUST
WARN YOU ABOUT?

22:08.528 --> 22:11.464
- ABOUT FINISHING
EACH OTHER'S SENTENCES?

22:13.800 --> 22:16.869
- MARRIAGE IS
A DOOMSDAY MACHINE,

22:16.903 --> 22:19.972
DESTINED TO SELF-DESTRUCT.

22:20.006 --> 22:23.843
FORTUNATELY, HOWEVER,
FOR YOU AND I,

22:23.876 --> 22:27.480
WE'LL BE SPARED
SUCH A DISMAL FATE.

22:31.751 --> 22:34.454
- "LIFE IS JUST
A BOWL OF FAIRIES."

22:34.487 --> 22:38.491
- IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES.
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.993
- WELL, THANKS.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.463
BUT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE A
LITTLE PISSED ABOUT MY NEW LOOK.

22:43.496 --> 22:46.499
- I LOVE YOUR NEW LOOK.
I LOVED IT ON ME.

22:46.533 --> 22:49.469
- [laughs]

22:49.502 --> 22:51.137
- AND I'M PROUD OF YOU

22:51.170 --> 22:53.540
FOR DOING SUCH A GREAT JOB
AT THE DINER, SO...

22:53.573 --> 22:57.043
- WELL, IT'S EASY WHEN YOU
HAVE SUCH A GREAT TEACHER.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.647
- YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

23:00.680 --> 23:03.616
- UH...

23:03.650 --> 23:06.185
YEAH, YOU MIGHT SAY THAT.
I'M, UH...

23:06.218 --> 23:07.554
I'M LEAVING.

23:07.587 --> 23:10.089
- YEAH? FOR THE WEEKEND?

23:10.122 --> 23:11.924
- NO. FOR GOOD.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.496
MY GODDAMN SISTER TOLD
MY GODDAMN HUSBAND DARRELL

23:16.529 --> 23:17.764
WHERE I AM.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.899
NOW HE'S COMING TO GET ME.

23:19.932 --> 23:21.501
- SO WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

23:21.534 --> 23:23.035
- I HAVEN'T HAD TIME
TO FIGURE THAT OUT YET,

23:23.069 --> 23:25.638
BUT I KNOW I CAN'T BE HERE
WHEN HE SHOWS UP.

23:25.672 --> 23:28.107
- NOW, JUST HOLD ON.
YOU ALSO CAN'T JUST RUN AWAY.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.510
- I CAN, AND I AM.

23:30.543 --> 23:34.581
- WHEN THE ASSHOLE SHOWS UP,
JUST TELL HIM TO GO FUCK OFF.

23:34.614 --> 23:37.517
- YOU DO NOT TELL
DARRELL PYE TO FUCK OFF.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.118
NO, SIR, NO WAY.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.588
AND THAT'S A FACT.
- WELL, HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

23:41.621 --> 23:42.955
WHEREVER YOU GO,
HE'S GOING TO FIND YOU

23:42.989 --> 23:46.092
THE NEXT TIME TOO.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.461
- SO WHAT DO I DO?

23:51.030 --> 23:53.065
- I'LL GIVE YOU
ANOTHER T-SHIRT.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.934
YOU CAN WEAR IT
WHEN HE ARRIVES.

23:54.967 --> 23:57.470
- AND WHAT DOES
THAT ONE SAY?

23:57.504 --> 23:59.539
- IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.708
IT'S GOT THIS ON IT.

24:03.610 --> 24:06.445
DARRELL WILL GET
THE MESSAGE.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.017
- [sighs]

24:11.050 --> 24:14.487
[chatter, laughter]

24:16.122 --> 24:18.090
- AND IF YOU WANT
TULIPS THIS SPRING,

24:18.124 --> 24:19.759
YOU HAVE TO PLANT
THE BULBS NOW.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.594
THE SAME WITH HYACINTHS.

24:21.628 --> 24:24.564
- ELI'S THE GARDENER
IN THE FAMILY, I'M THE CHEF.

24:24.597 --> 24:26.733
- AND ROSE BUSHES ON EACH SIDE
OF THE FRONT WALK

24:26.766 --> 24:28.701
WOULD LOOK FABULOUS.

24:28.735 --> 24:31.037
- I REMEMBER
WHEN I WAS A KID

24:31.070 --> 24:34.240
PLANTING PANSIES
IN THE FRONT YARD WITH MY MOM.

24:34.273 --> 24:35.908
- AND LOOK WHAT BLOOMED.

24:35.942 --> 24:37.644
- WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS THE GARDENER,

24:37.677 --> 24:39.045
AND WHICH ONE
IS THE CHEF?

24:39.078 --> 24:40.713
- I REALLY LIKE COOKING.

24:40.747 --> 24:44.684
- AND I LOVE PLANTING
MY SEED IN SOME HOLE.

24:47.754 --> 24:49.756
I-IN THE GROUND.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.926
- BY THE WAY,
I BROUGHT YOU THAT PETITION.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.762
- OH, YEAH, GREAT.
WE'LL BE HAPPY TO SIGN.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.630
- WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE CITY
TO PUT IN SPEED BUMPS.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.131
- THE WAY THAT SOME PEOPLE
COME RACING DOWN THE STREET,

24:59.165 --> 25:02.168
YOU'D THINK
IT WAS A DRAG STRIP.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.036
- I DOUBT BRIAN'S
VERY INTERESTED IN SPEED BUMPS.

25:04.070 --> 25:05.271
- ON THE CONTRARY.

25:05.304 --> 25:07.674
SPEED BUMPS
ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT,

25:07.707 --> 25:10.276
ESPECIALLY
BEFORE YOU GO OUT DANCING.

25:10.309 --> 25:13.546
- WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU DO,
BRIAN?

25:13.580 --> 25:15.615
- HE'S PRESIDENT
AND CEO OF KINNETIK,

25:15.648 --> 25:17.817
THE TOP ADVERTISING AGENCY
IN PITTSBURGH.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.886
- I'M ALSO PRESIDENT
AND CEO OF BABYLON,

25:19.919 --> 25:21.888
THE TOP GAY DANCE CLUB
IN PITTSBURGH.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.155
- BABYLON.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.291
WE HAVEN'T BEEN THERE
IN YEARS.

25:25.324 --> 25:28.160
- WELL, YOU TWO
SHOULD COME BY

25:28.194 --> 25:30.029
AS MY PERSONAL GUESTS.

25:30.062 --> 25:34.100
- I HARDLY THINK BABYLON
SUITS OUR LIFESTYLE.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.703
- CAN I GET
ANYBODY ANYTHING?

25:36.736 --> 25:39.038
- WHICH LIFESTYLE IS THAT,
MONTY?

25:39.071 --> 25:40.306
- I-I'M MONTY.

25:40.339 --> 25:43.676
- WHICH LIFESTYLE IS THAT,
MONTY?

25:43.710 --> 25:45.645
- WELL, THESE DAYS, UH...

25:45.678 --> 25:48.981
WE PREFER TO SPEND QUIET TIME
AT HOME WITH OUR KIDS.

25:49.015 --> 25:52.685
- RATHER THAN IN A ROOM
FULL OF DRUGGED-UP PETER PANS.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.320
- [chuckling]
YOU KNOW,

25:54.353 --> 25:56.088
SO MANY COUPLES
I SPEAK TO THESE DAYS

25:56.122 --> 25:57.790
FEEL THAT WAY.
[sniffs]

25:57.824 --> 26:00.059
THAT'S WHY I'M STARTING
MONOGAMOUS MONDAYS.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.994
[chuckling]

26:02.028 --> 26:04.330
- BRIAN'S A REAL KIDDER.

26:04.363 --> 26:06.232
- I HARDLY THINK THE KIND OF
PROMISCUOUS BEHAVIOR

26:06.265 --> 26:08.200
THAT BABYLON PROMOTES
IS A LAUGHING MATTER.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.269
- OH, COME ON, FELLAS,

26:10.302 --> 26:11.938
DON'T TELL ME
THAT AFTER...

26:11.971 --> 26:13.973
HOW MANY DID YOU SAY,
TEN YEARS TOGETHER,

26:14.006 --> 26:16.075
YOU HAVEN'T HAD
A LITTLE EXTRAMARITAL ASS?

26:16.108 --> 26:18.077
- BRIAN.
[mouthing]

26:18.110 --> 26:20.212
- ACTUALLY, WE NEVER HAVE.

26:20.246 --> 26:23.015
IT'S CALLED BEING IN
A MATURE, LOVING RELATIONSHIP.

26:23.049 --> 26:24.751
- THAT'S CALLED BEING DEAD.

26:24.784 --> 26:28.721
- HOW ABOUT YOU HELP ME
WITH DESSERT?

26:28.755 --> 26:31.991
- FIRST...
PRESENTS.

26:32.024 --> 26:35.361
NOW...

26:35.394 --> 26:37.664
HOPE YOU BOYS
DON'T ALREADY HAVE ONE.

26:44.871 --> 26:46.773
- YOU BOUGHT US A SLING?

26:46.806 --> 26:48.908
- YOU TOLD ME
YOU WERE FURNISHING A PLAYROOM.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.243
- NOT THAT KIND
OF PLAYROOM.

26:51.277 --> 26:54.180
- OH.

26:54.213 --> 26:58.751
STILL, I'M SURE YOU'LL GET
HOURS OF ENJOYMENT FROM IT.

27:02.822 --> 27:05.658
SO WHAT'S FOR DESSERT?

27:08.160 --> 27:09.729
[starter pistol fires]

27:09.762 --> 27:12.164
[cheers and applause]

27:14.801 --> 27:17.203
- IN OUR HOME,
IN FRONT OF OUR FRIENDS.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.404
- YOU GOT TO LET IT GO,
MICHAEL.

27:18.437 --> 27:20.439
- I KNOW,
LIVE IN THE NOW.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.810
WELL, RIGHT NOW, I'D LIKE TO
HOLD BRIAN'S HEAD UNDER WATER.

27:23.843 --> 27:26.378
- ATTAGIRL, CALLIE!
- WAY TO GO, HONEY!

27:29.381 --> 27:30.983
- YOU CAN DO IT!

27:35.054 --> 27:36.956
[cheering]
[whistle blows]

27:36.989 --> 27:38.925
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ALL RIGHT. GOOD GIRL.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.760
- CLEAR THE LANES.

27:40.793 --> 27:42.228
- IT'S CALLIE'S PARENTS
MAKING FOOLS OF THEMSELVES.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.931
- JUST IGNORE THEM.
WE'RE HERE FOR HUNTER.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.200
- NEXT UP,
BOYS' 50-METER FREESTYLE.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.102
- OH, MY GOD, THAT'S US.
- YEP. YEP.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.709
[background chatter]

27:56.743 --> 27:59.045
- SWIMMERS, ON YOUR MARKS.

27:59.078 --> 28:00.179
GET SET.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.281
[starter pistol fires]

28:05.351 --> 28:09.321
[crowd shouting]

28:09.355 --> 28:10.957
- GO, HUNTER!

28:10.990 --> 28:13.059
- COME ON, PAL.
COME ON.

28:13.092 --> 28:15.928
- GO, GO, GO!
- WHOO!

28:15.962 --> 28:18.464
- GO. GO!

28:18.497 --> 28:21.267
- COME ON, HUNTER.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.110
COME ON, HUNTER, DIG.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.414
- GO, GO, GO.

28:35.447 --> 28:37.984
- YEAH. YEAH!
[whistle blows]

28:38.017 --> 28:39.819
- HE WON!
- YEAH.

28:39.852 --> 28:43.722
- HUNTER WON!
- SHH, SHH, SHH.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.868
- HUNTER, A-ARE YOU OKAY?

28:58.004 --> 28:59.138
- CHRIST, I THINK
HE HURT HIMSELF.

28:59.171 --> 29:00.306
- OH, SHIT.
HEY.

29:00.339 --> 29:02.208
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE BLEEDING.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.143
COACH, HUNTER'S HURT!

29:04.176 --> 29:06.112
- CALLIE, DON'T!
- DON'T TOUCH HIM!

29:06.145 --> 29:07.313
- GET OUT OF THE POOL,
HONEY!

29:07.346 --> 29:08.981
- OH, MY GOD.
- HE'S GOT AIDS.

29:09.015 --> 29:11.884
GET OUT OF THERE!
- EVERYBODY, OUT. NOW!

29:14.086 --> 29:15.421
EVERYBODY, OUT.

29:18.557 --> 29:20.126
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- COME ON, PAL,

29:20.159 --> 29:21.527
LET'S GO GET THAT LOOKED AT.

29:21.560 --> 29:24.831
[crowd murmuring]

29:35.942 --> 29:38.577
- THAT'S A NICE NOSE.

29:38.610 --> 29:41.080
NOW, THAT'S WHAT
I CALL A CHIN.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.949
[sighs]

29:42.982 --> 29:45.417
TEDDY, IF YOU DON'T GET
THESE CHEEKS, I WILL.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.019
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

29:47.053 --> 29:49.055
- I THINK
I'M GOING TO PUKE.

29:49.088 --> 29:50.923
- I WARNED YOU, DIDN'T I?

29:50.957 --> 29:52.424
DIDN'T I WARN YOU
NOT TO GORGE YOURSELF?

29:52.458 --> 29:54.961
- IT'S NOT THAT.
LOOK AT ME.

29:54.994 --> 29:57.429
I LOOK LIKE A COW CHART
IN THE BUTCHER SHOP.

29:57.463 --> 30:00.599
- JUST THINK,
WHEN THEY REVEAL THE NEW YOU,

30:00.632 --> 30:02.368
YOU KNOW, LIKE THE WOMAN
WITH THE HARELIP

30:02.401 --> 30:04.036
AND THE HUMP
ON EXTREME MAKEOVER,

30:04.070 --> 30:05.371
YOU'LL BE WEEPING WITH JOY.

30:05.404 --> 30:06.472
- [scoffs]

30:08.107 --> 30:10.943
- [moaning]

30:14.413 --> 30:17.917
- I'VE NEVER HAD
ANY SURGERY BEFORE.

30:17.950 --> 30:20.052
I STILL HAVE EVERYTHING
INTACT, YOU KNOW.

30:20.086 --> 30:22.955
MY--MY APPENDIX,
MY TONSILS.

30:22.989 --> 30:25.391
- FORESKIN.
- MY WISDOM TEETH.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.860
THIS WILL BE MY FIRST TIME
UNDER THE KNIFE.

30:27.894 --> 30:29.595
- PISH! IT'S NOTHING.

30:29.628 --> 30:31.197
- YOU CAN SIT THERE
AND PISH ALL YOU WANT.

30:31.230 --> 30:32.999
I'M THE ONE
ABOUT TO SUFFER SEVERE PAIN

30:33.032 --> 30:36.335
FOR THE SAKE OF A NEW ME.

30:36.368 --> 30:38.971
WHAT IF I DON'T LIKE
THE NEW ME?

30:39.005 --> 30:40.472
- WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?

30:40.506 --> 30:43.209
YOU'LL HAVE
A 30-INCH WAIST,

30:43.242 --> 30:45.945
CROW'S FEET
THAT HAVE FLOWN THE COOP,

30:45.978 --> 30:47.513
UH, CHEEKBONES
TO DIE FOR.

30:47.546 --> 30:49.015
- I'M NOT GETTING CHEEKBONES.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.349
SHOULD I HAVE
GOTTEN CHEEKBONES?

30:50.382 --> 30:53.219
OH, GOD.
OH, MAYBE BRIAN'S RIGHT.

30:53.252 --> 30:55.354
MAYBE THIS OBSESSION
WITH YOUTH AND BEAUTY

30:55.387 --> 30:57.423
IS SHALLOW, SUPERFICIAL,
NARCISSISTIC...

30:57.456 --> 30:59.625
- WE'RE FAGS,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

30:59.658 --> 31:01.160
BEING OBSESSED
WITH YOUTH AND BEAUTY

31:01.193 --> 31:02.962
IS OUR GOD-GIVEN RIGHT.

31:02.995 --> 31:05.531
- SHOULD I PULL OUT?

31:05.564 --> 31:09.101
- YOU'RE SERIOUSLY ASKING ME
THAT QUESTION?

31:09.135 --> 31:11.170
TEDDY, FOR AS LONG
AS I HAVE KNOWN YOU,

31:11.203 --> 31:14.240
YOU HAVE NEVER FELT GOOD,
REALLY GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF.

31:14.273 --> 31:16.242
SO IF A FEW INCISIONS

31:16.275 --> 31:18.244
AND A LITTLE FAT-SUCKING
IS WHAT IT TAKES

31:18.277 --> 31:19.545
FOR YOU TO FINALLY
BE ABLE

31:19.578 --> 31:21.180
TO LOOK
IN A MIRROR AND SMILE,

31:21.213 --> 31:24.383
THEN I SAY IT'S NOT SHALLOW
AND SUPERFICIAL.

31:24.416 --> 31:26.452
IT'S A BLESSING.

31:28.420 --> 31:31.557
- THANK YOU, EM.

31:31.590 --> 31:35.161
- MR. SCHMIDT?

31:35.194 --> 31:37.029
- WELL, GO ON.

31:37.063 --> 31:39.565
DR. DE MILLE IS READY
FOR YOUR CLOSE-UP.

31:49.375 --> 31:52.344
- OKAY, OKAY,
DIAPERS, POWDER,

31:52.378 --> 31:56.215
BOO-BOO BEAR, LOTION.

31:56.248 --> 32:00.086
LOTION.
WHERE'S THE LOTION?

32:00.119 --> 32:02.388
- THERE'S ENOUGH
FOR A NUDIST COLONY.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.223
- YEAH, WHEN THERE'S
A BABY, BE PREPARED.

32:04.256 --> 32:07.226
- SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE SCOUT.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.196
IT WAS A JOKE.

32:10.229 --> 32:12.631
- ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS EXPRESS MY MILK.

32:12.664 --> 32:16.035
- WHEN'S MICHAEL
PICKING HER UP?

32:16.068 --> 32:17.970
- TOMORROW.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.440
- MEL.
- HE JUST BETTER KNOW

32:21.473 --> 32:25.377
WHAT THE FUCK HE'S DOING.
- WE'LL FIND OUT.

32:25.411 --> 32:27.113
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING,

32:27.146 --> 32:29.248
WHY DOESN'T GUS STAY
WITH YOU TOMORROW NIGHT?

32:29.281 --> 32:30.716
- HOT DATE?

32:30.749 --> 32:32.584
- NO. I JUST THOUGHT
IT'D BE NICE FOR YOU

32:32.618 --> 32:35.454
TO HAVE SOME COMPANY.
- OH, SO I WON'T BE LONELY?

32:35.487 --> 32:38.190
THANKS, BUT AS MUCH
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE HIM HERE,

32:38.224 --> 32:39.591
I DON'T NEED YOUR PITY.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.093
- IT'S NOT PITY.

32:41.127 --> 32:42.494
- NO, IT'S YOU
BEING GRACIOUS.

32:42.528 --> 32:44.530
MAKING THE GRAND GESTURE.

32:44.563 --> 32:45.764
- I WAS ONLY TRYING
TO THINK OF YOU.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.066
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD
HAVE DONE THAT

32:47.099 --> 32:48.600
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.236
- [sighs]

32:50.269 --> 32:53.672
GUS, HONEY,
IT'S TIME TO LEAVE.

32:53.705 --> 32:56.408
[clears throat]
I HOPE IT GOES WELL TOMORROW,

32:56.442 --> 32:58.344
DESPITE WHAT YOU THINK.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.079
- WE DIDN'T PLAY YET.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.347
- COME ON, GUS.
WE'VE GOT TO GO.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.349
- NO, I DON'T WANT TO GO.

33:03.382 --> 33:04.616
- PUT ON YOUR COAT, HONEY.

33:04.650 --> 33:08.454
- NO!
I DON'T WANT TO GO.

33:12.124 --> 33:14.360
- TWO HOURS
FOR A FUCKING BAND-AID.

33:14.393 --> 33:16.362
GOOD THING
I WASN'T DECAPITATED.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.164
I'D BE SITTING
IN THAT GODDAMN EMERGENCY ROOM

33:18.197 --> 33:20.766
HOLDING MY HEAD ALL NIGHT.
- HA. WE'RE HOME NOW.

33:20.799 --> 33:23.135
- GO UPSTAIRS AND RELAX.
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.

33:23.169 --> 33:26.038
- RELAX?
- YOU HAVE A CONCUSSION.

33:26.072 --> 33:27.773
THE DOCTOR TOLD YOU...
- I'M FINE.

33:27.806 --> 33:29.508
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH ME.

33:29.541 --> 33:32.111
EXCEPT THANKS
TO CALLIE'S ASSHOLE FATHER

33:32.144 --> 33:34.113
AND CUNT MOTHER...
- HEY.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.514
- WELL, SHE IS!

33:35.547 --> 33:37.116
NOW EVERYONE AT SCHOOL
THINKS I HAVE AIDS.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.518
- YOU DON'T HAVE AIDS.
YOU HAVE HIV.

33:39.551 --> 33:41.053
- DON'T TELL ME,
TELL THEM.

33:41.087 --> 33:42.788
EXCEPT YOU
DON'T HAVE TO...

33:42.821 --> 33:46.392
'CAUSE I'M NEVER
GOING BACK THERE.

33:46.425 --> 33:49.261
- YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

33:49.295 --> 33:50.796
- YEAH, RIGHT!
- THERE'S NOT.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.264
YOUR COACH SAID HE'S GOING
TO TALK TO EVERYONE,

33:52.298 --> 33:53.699
EXPLAIN THAT
YOU CAN'T GET THE VIRUS

33:53.732 --> 33:57.569
FROM A FEW DROPS OF BLOOD
IN A CHLORINATED POOL.

33:57.603 --> 33:59.305
- IF YOU WANT TO TAKE
THE DAY OFF TOMORROW,

33:59.338 --> 34:00.539
THAT'S FINE BY US.

34:00.572 --> 34:02.141
BUT SOONER OR LATER,

34:02.174 --> 34:03.409
YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO GO BACK.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.077
- YEAH, AND WHEN YOU DO,
YOU CAN TELL THEM

34:05.111 --> 34:08.480
YOU'RE THE 50-METER
FREESTYLE CHAMPION.

34:08.514 --> 34:10.716
- [sighs]

34:12.618 --> 34:14.086
- [grunting]

34:14.120 --> 34:15.854
- THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE FLYING

34:15.887 --> 34:18.224
MAGNIFICENTLY
THROUGH THE AIR.

34:18.257 --> 34:21.293
SUPERHEROES,
NOT TWO CRASH-TEST DUMMIES

34:21.327 --> 34:23.162
IN A HYUNDAI FACTORY.

34:23.195 --> 34:25.197
TRY IT AGAIN.
- IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.

34:25.231 --> 34:26.698
- "PRETTY GOOD"
IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.435
WHEN MICHAEL SEES IT,
I WANT HIM TO LOSE HIS MIND

34:29.468 --> 34:33.105
AND HIS BREATH
AND HIS BLADDER CONTROL.

34:33.139 --> 34:34.706
- AND THEN WHAT?

34:34.740 --> 34:39.178
COME RUNNING BACK TO BABYLON
WHERE HE BELONGS?

34:39.211 --> 34:40.179
IT AIN'T GOING TO HAPPEN.

34:40.212 --> 34:42.181
HE'S HAPPY WHERE HE IS.

34:42.214 --> 34:44.716
- GAY MEN CANNOT
LIVE ON TULIP BEDS

34:44.750 --> 34:47.386
AND SPEED BUMPS ALONE.

34:47.419 --> 34:49.655
SOONER OR LATER,
THE SERENGETI WILL CALL,

34:49.688 --> 34:52.458
AND HE'LL PACE
RESTLESSLY IN HIS CAGE,

34:52.491 --> 34:54.593
HOWLING AT THE MOON.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.595
AND THEN HE'LL BREAK FREE
FROM SUBURBIA

34:56.628 --> 34:59.565
AND RETURN TO THE JUNGLE
WHERE HE BELONGS.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.870
OKAY, SPAZ-MAN
AND KLUTZ-BOY,

35:04.903 --> 35:06.605
GET IT RIGHT.

35:06.638 --> 35:08.740
- OKAY, LET'S TRY IT AGAIN.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.677
- I NEED ANOTHER MAC AND CHEESE
AND A TURKEY MEAT LOAF.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.645
- EXCUSE ME, MA'AM,

35:13.679 --> 35:15.647
BUT AREN'T YOU GOING
TO TAKE MY ORDER?

35:19.651 --> 35:21.753
- HEY, I DIDN'T ORDER THIS.

35:21.787 --> 35:23.722
- TRY IT.
YOU'LL LIKE IT.

35:25.857 --> 35:28.227
- NOW, HONEY,
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,

35:28.260 --> 35:31.497
I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW TRULY
AND DEEPLY SORRY I AM

35:31.530 --> 35:34.132
FOR OUR LITTLE SPAT.

35:35.567 --> 35:36.902
HOW'S YOUR JAW?

35:36.935 --> 35:38.570
- WELL, I CAN CHEW
THE SALISBURY STEAK

35:38.604 --> 35:40.639
IN THIS PLACE,
SO I GUESS IT'S OKAY.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.241
- [chuckles]

35:42.274 --> 35:43.709
LOOK,
I KNOW I LOST MY TEMPER.

35:43.742 --> 35:45.811
I PROMISE
I WON'T DO THAT AGAIN.

35:45.844 --> 35:48.180
- THAT'S WHAT
YOU ALWAYS SAY.

35:48.214 --> 35:51.217
- COME ON.
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO COME HOME.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.453
- DARRELL, I...
- LOOK,

35:54.486 --> 35:56.522
Y-Y-YOU DON'T
HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

35:56.555 --> 35:58.290
I FORGIVE YOU.

35:59.758 --> 36:02.228
- YOU FORGIVE ME?

36:02.261 --> 36:03.829
- YEAH.
FORGET ALL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

36:03.862 --> 36:06.798
HMM?
JUST GET YOUR COAT...

36:06.832 --> 36:09.735
- I DON'T WANT
TO FORGET IT.

36:10.969 --> 36:13.672
I'M NOT GOING BACK HOME.

36:13.705 --> 36:17.276
I'M STAYING HERE.

36:17.309 --> 36:20.178
- WHAT, SLINGING HASH
IN SOME FAG DINER?

36:21.880 --> 36:23.849
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO DO

36:23.882 --> 36:26.452
TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,
TO BE INDEPENDENT?

36:26.485 --> 36:28.220
YOU KNOW, THAT'D BE FUNNY

36:28.254 --> 36:30.822
IF IT WEREN'T
SO DAMN PITIFUL.

36:30.856 --> 36:33.592
- I'M NOT PITIFUL.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.696
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE PROVING HERE, LORETTA?

36:37.729 --> 36:39.831
THAT YOU CAN LIVE
WITHOUT A MAN?

36:39.865 --> 36:43.369
ARE YOU A LEZZIE?

36:43.402 --> 36:46.838
- I AM, DARRELL.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.375
I AM A LESBIAN,
AND I'M NOT ASHAMED.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.543
- WELL, YOU OUGHT TO BE.

36:54.646 --> 36:55.981
YOUR PROBLEM'S JUST
THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN

36:56.014 --> 36:57.649
GETTING ENOUGH RECENTLY.

36:57.683 --> 36:59.251
I'M GOING TO TAKE CARE
OF THAT, SWEETHEART.

36:59.285 --> 37:01.853
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

37:01.887 --> 37:03.455
- NOW,
WHAT'D YOU SAY TO ME?

37:03.489 --> 37:05.391
- I TOLD YOU.
- AND I'M TELLING YOU

37:05.424 --> 37:08.927
MY TRUCK IS PARKED OUTSIDE.
NOW, LET'S GO!

37:08.960 --> 37:10.228
[door slams]

37:12.030 --> 37:13.732
WHAT THE--

37:13.765 --> 37:15.934
- EXACTLY WHAT PART
OF "FUCK OFF"

37:15.967 --> 37:18.737
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

37:18.770 --> 37:21.640
- I'M THE ONE
WITH THE BASEBALL BAT.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.876
- THIS IS BETWEEN ME
AND MY WIFE.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.878
- AND SHE'S TRYING
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.014
ONLY YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT
THROUGH YOUR HEAD,

37:29.047 --> 37:30.816
SO MAYBE MY FRIEND HERE
CAN HELP.

37:30.849 --> 37:34.353
- LET'S GO. COME ON.
- NO!

37:34.386 --> 37:36.622
I SAID NO!

37:36.655 --> 37:41.393
YOU ARE NOT A NICE PERSON,
DARRELL.

37:41.427 --> 37:44.763
YOU DON'T TREAT ME
WITH THE RESPECT I DESERVE...

37:44.796 --> 37:48.834
AND I DON'T LOVE YOU
ANYMORE.

37:52.671 --> 37:55.607
- I HOPE YOU HEARD HER
THIS TIME.

37:59.077 --> 38:01.913
NOW YOU BETTER LEAVE
BEFORE ME AND MY FAG FRIENDS

38:01.947 --> 38:05.417
BEAT THE LIVING SHIT
OUT OF YOU.

38:20.098 --> 38:23.835
[door opens, slams]

38:28.039 --> 38:30.976
[overlapping chatter]

38:44.122 --> 38:47.659
- HOW'S YOUR HEAD?
- I'LL LIVE.

38:49.861 --> 38:53.899
- LOOK, I'M SORRY
FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

38:53.932 --> 38:55.601
- WHAT ARE YOU SORRY FOR?

38:55.634 --> 38:57.503
I'M THE ONE
WHO'S STUPID ENOUGH TO BELIEVE

38:57.536 --> 39:01.440
NO ONE
WOULD EVER FIND OUT.

39:01.473 --> 39:02.908
- HEY, CALLIE,

39:02.941 --> 39:03.875
WHAT ARE YOU WASTING
YOUR TIME FOR?

39:03.909 --> 39:05.444
HE'S A FAG.

39:05.477 --> 39:06.778
- I HEAR THE WAY HE GOT AIDS

39:06.812 --> 39:08.013
WAS LETTING OLD GEEZERS
FUCK HIM UP THE ASS

39:08.046 --> 39:09.481
FOR CASH.

39:09.515 --> 39:11.583
- YOU TOLD.

39:11.617 --> 39:13.585
- NO, I SWEAR I DIDN'T.

39:13.619 --> 39:16.855
- HEY, FAGGOT, HERE'S 5 BUCKS.
WHY DON'T YOU SUCK MY COCK?

39:16.888 --> 39:19.591
- I CHARGE WAY MORE THAN THAT
FOR ASSHOLES LIKE YOU.

39:19.625 --> 39:21.493
- LUCAS, STOP IT.
- YOU WANT TO GET AIDS?

39:21.527 --> 39:22.628
THEN GO ON.
HIT ME.

39:22.661 --> 39:25.597
GET MY BLOOD
ALL OVER YOU!

39:25.631 --> 39:26.998
- COME ON. COME ON.

39:27.032 --> 39:28.767
- FAGGOT.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.737
[class bell rings]

39:31.770 --> 39:33.939
- ARE YOU OKAY?

39:58.196 --> 40:01.199
[dramatic music]

40:01.232 --> 40:02.901
*

40:02.934 --> 40:06.638
- I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T
PROMISE YOU SCHMIDT.

40:06.672 --> 40:08.907
HE'S THE HOTTEST GUY
IN TOWN.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.676
EVEN I WANT TO FUCK HIM.

40:10.709 --> 40:12.678
TED?

40:13.812 --> 40:15.080

I'M SORRY, BRIAN.

- HMM. I'LL SAY.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.001
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

40:36.034 --> 40:38.604
- LIKE I WAS HIT
BY A BUS AND LEFT FOR DEAD

40:38.637 --> 40:40.472
AND THEN STEPPED ON
BY AN ELEPHANT.

40:40.506 --> 40:43.074
- [chuckles]
- HOW DO I LOOK?

40:43.108 --> 40:46.545
- A TAD...PUFFY.

40:46.578 --> 40:48.814
BUT THE DOCTOR SAID,
"GIVE IT A FEW DAYS,

40:48.847 --> 40:51.249
AND YOU'LL BE GORGEOUS."

40:51.282 --> 40:53.151
- OH, RIGHT.

YOU'LL BE RIGHT THERE
WITH ME.

41:00.926 --> 41:04.963
NOW, YOU LIE THERE
AND REST, OKAY?

41:04.996 --> 41:07.933
AND REMEMBER,
NO PEEKING.

41:21.279 --> 41:24.149
- NO PEEKING.

41:24.182 --> 41:26.117
[sighs]

41:26.151 --> 41:28.119
FUCK NO PEEKING.

WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT I'M GOING TO BE

42:12.731 --> 42:14.800
IF I HAVE
ANOTHER ONE OF THESE.

42:14.833 --> 42:18.303
- ME TOO.

42:18.336 --> 42:20.639
both: ANOTHER SHOOTER!

42:20.672 --> 42:24.309
[both laughing]

42:24.342 --> 42:26.044
- I'M SO PROUD OF YOU

42:26.077 --> 42:30.649
FOR TELLING THAT FORMER ASSHOLE
OF YOURS TO FUCK OFF.

42:30.682 --> 42:33.719
- WELL, I NEVER COULD'VE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOU AND YOUR BIG BAT.

42:33.752 --> 42:35.654
- BIGGER THAN HIS,
I'LL BET.

42:35.687 --> 42:37.823

AFRAID OF HIM ANYMORE.

42:45.163 --> 42:47.365

HOW I CAN EVER REPAY YOU, DEB.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.701
- FOR WHAT?

42:49.735 --> 42:52.337
- WELL, FIRST YOU GIVE ME
A NEW LIFE, AND...

42:52.370 --> 42:55.273
AND THEN YOU SAVE IT.

42:55.306 --> 43:00.245

A DAMN THING.

BUT THERE IS SOMETHING
THAT YOU OWE YOURSELF.

43:03.381 --> 43:06.718
HAPPINESS.

THROUGH A LOT OF SHIT,

43:08.386 --> 43:10.689
AND YOU DESERVE IT.

43:10.722 --> 43:13.091
- SOMEONE TO SHARE IT WITH?

43:13.124 --> 43:15.927

WHO'LL TREAT YOU RIGHT.
