01:45.600 --> 01:47.636
( screaming )

01:47.740 --> 01:49.162
Let me see...

01:49.270 --> 01:52.569
Let me see
what's in the--

01:55.810 --> 01:57.072
NOW YOU KNOW,
MOTHER.

01:57.180 --> 01:58.408
I'M A GYPSY !

01:58.510 --> 02:00.273
I'M IN THE ROAD COMPANY
OF 42nd STREET !

02:00.380 --> 02:02.348
AND MY FEET
ARE GIGANTIC !

02:02.450 --> 02:06.659
You hit him with
the shoes, didn't you ?

02:06.760 --> 02:07.954
WELL, DUH, BITCH !

02:08.060 --> 02:09.288
You hit him
with the shoes,

02:09.390 --> 02:10.550
that's how he got
those half-moon marks

02:10.660 --> 02:12.389
on his forehead
and on his hands.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.092
BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE
CIGARETTE BURNS ON HIS ASS ?

02:14.200 --> 02:17.124
Answer me !

02:17.230 --> 02:18.959
MOMMY, YOU NEED
TO GO ON PROZAC.

02:19.070 --> 02:20.799
AND FAST.

02:20.900 --> 02:23.300
I had to hit him with the shoes,
what else could I do ?

02:23.410 --> 02:24.934
FLOG HIM WITH
THOSE BRAIDS ?

02:25.040 --> 02:27.304
But it was
his fault.

02:27.410 --> 02:30.004
If he gave me the medal
like I told him to,

02:30.110 --> 02:31.509
I wouldn't
have hit him.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.646
THAT STILL DOESN'T
EXPLAIN WHY YOU FUCKED HIM.

02:33.750 --> 02:35.877
Alright, alright now,

02:35.980 --> 02:38.983
we're gonna start
at the beginning

02:39.090 --> 02:40.557
and you're going
to tell me the truth.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.685
Now, I know you killed him,
so there's no sense lying.

02:42.790 --> 02:44.951
Rhoda, I wt you
to tell me the truth !

02:45.060 --> 02:46.948
THE TRUTH, YOU'RE TOO OLD
TO BE MY MOMMY !

02:47.060 --> 02:48.721
SOCIALISM IS
A BETTER SYSTEM !

02:48.830 --> 02:50.263
YOU'RE A MAN !

02:50.370 --> 02:52.998
HOW CAN I BE A MAN WHEN
MY GIRDLE HURTS THIS MUCH ?

02:53.100 --> 02:55.034
I DON'T KNOW,
ASK CHARLES PIERCE !

02:55.140 --> 02:59.167
( laughing )

03:03.280 --> 03:06.101
And I told him
I'd hit him with my shoe

03:06.220 --> 03:07.949
if he didn't
give me the medal !

03:08.050 --> 03:11.315
Oh, Mommy, Mommy, please say
you won't let them hurt me !

03:11.420 --> 03:13.149
HONEY, YOU JUST
KILLED 'EM ALL ANYWAY.

03:13.260 --> 03:17.321
I don't know what
must be done now,

03:17.430 --> 03:21.059
but I promise you
nobody will hurt you.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.162
I want to play the way
we used to, Mommy.

03:23.270 --> 03:25.192
Will you
play with me ?

03:25.300 --> 03:27.962
NOT UNLESS YOU PAY ME FIRST,
YOU LITTLE FREAK.

03:28.070 --> 03:30.868
If I give you
a basket of kisses...

03:30.970 --> 03:32.972
NO DISCOUNTS
FOR FAMILY !

03:33.080 --> 03:37.301
Please, can't you
give me an answer ?

03:57.030 --> 03:59.123
HEY, LIS.

03:59.230 --> 04:01.892
YOU AWAKE ?

04:04.240 --> 04:08.734
( purring )

04:08.840 --> 04:11.445
( gasping )

04:18.620 --> 04:21.589
( laughing )

04:25.260 --> 04:27.899
OH, CAN YOU RUN
BY WHOLE FOODS

04:28.000 --> 04:30.798
AND PICK UP LIKE SIX
MAHI-MAHI FILETS FOR TOMORROW ?

04:30.900 --> 04:32.390
SIX ?

04:32.500 --> 04:34.434
YEAH, I'M MAKING DINNER
FOR YOUR MOM'S BIRTHDAY.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.508
SHE TOLD YOU
NOT TO DO THAT.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.362
JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE
TES YOU NOT TO DO SOMETHING

04:38.470 --> 04:40.301
DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T
WANT YOU TO DO IT.

04:40.410 --> 04:43.243
LISA, MAYBE YOUR MOTHER
LIKES PEOPLE TO GO

04:43.350 --> 04:44.999
OUT OF THEIR WAY
FOR HER BIRTHDAY,

04:45.110 --> 04:46.441
BUT TRUST ME,

04:46.550 --> 04:49.269
MY MOTHER NEVER WANTS US
TO DO ANYTHING FOR HERS,

04:49.390 --> 04:50.846
AND WE NEVER DO.

04:50.950 --> 04:53.453
AND SO FAR, THAT'S WORKED OUT
GREAT FOR EVERYONE.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.983
DO YOU THINK SHE'D LIKE
SARAH MCLACHLAN ?

04:56.090 --> 04:58.183
IT'S A PARTY,
WE HAVE TO HAVE MUSIC.

04:58.290 --> 05:01.657
PLAY WHATEVER
YOU WANT.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.796
JUST DON'T COME RUNNING TO ME
WHEN IT BLOWS UP IN YOUR FACE.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.061
NOTHING'S GONNA BLOW UP
IN MY FACE, NATE.

05:06.170 --> 05:09.139
THIS IS IMPORTANT, I WANT
TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOUR MOM,

05:09.240 --> 05:11.003
NOW WITH US
LIVING HERE AND ALL.

05:11.110 --> 05:12.737
OKAY.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.273
JUST...

05:14.380 --> 05:17.941
KEEP YOUR EXPECTATIONS LOW,
IS ALL I'M SAYING.

05:20.020 --> 05:24.616
( female )
Companies were forced to
restrict how they market...

05:24.720 --> 05:27.018
OH, LISA CALLED WHILE
YOU WERE IN THE SHOWER.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.259
SHE WANTS US TO COME OVER
FOR DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.487
I THOUGHT IT WAS
OUR TURN TO INVITE THEM.

05:31.590 --> 05:34.423
NO, SHE'S THROWING A BIRTHDAY
PARTY FOR YOUR MOM.

05:34.530 --> 05:37.260
WHO DOES SHE
THINK SHE IS ?

05:37.370 --> 05:39.326
MY MOTHER DOES NOT LIKE
ANYTHING FOR HER BIRTHDAY.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.000
COME ON, YOUR MOM
DESERVES A PARTY.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.408
OH, YOU WANT
TO GO ?

05:43.510 --> 05:46.035
WHAT ELSE
ARE WE GONNA DO ?

05:46.140 --> 05:48.005
STAY HOME
AND WATCH PORN ?

05:48.110 --> 05:49.543
OH, WHICH REMINDS ME,

05:49.650 --> 05:52.869
YOU GOTTA RETURN
"THE GAYTRIXll TO VIDEO WEST.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.552
SOMEBODY WANT TO TELL ME
WHY I SHOULD GIVE A RAT'S ASS

06:05.660 --> 06:08.959
WHAT'S IN
SALMA HAYEK'S PURSE ?

06:13.200 --> 06:15.361
YOU ARE SOMETHING ELSE,
FISHER.

06:15.470 --> 06:16.607
I'M SORRY ?

06:16.710 --> 06:17.938
IT'S YOUR FUCKING
BIRTH DAY,

06:18.040 --> 06:19.803
AND YOU'RE SPENDING IT
AT THE DENTIST'S OFFICE ?

06:19.910 --> 06:21.571
WELL, I CAN'T JUST
IGNORE MY ORAL HYGIENE,

06:21.680 --> 06:23.705
AND I'M CELEBRATING
MY BIRTHDAY.

06:23.810 --> 06:25.448
THERE'S GONNA BE
A PARTY TOMORROW NIGHT.

06:25.550 --> 06:26.642
OH, YOU BET YA
THERE'S GONNA BE A PARTY,

06:26.750 --> 06:28.308
I'M GONNA MAKE
SURE OF THAT.

06:28.420 --> 06:30.285
EVEN IF I HAVE TO SPIKE
THE PUNCH WITH L-S-D.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.539
BETI'INA,
DON'T, PLEASE.

06:31.650 --> 06:33.288
SPEAKING OF L-S-D,

06:33.390 --> 06:35.278
YOUR SISTER CALLED ME
LAST NIGHT FROM HAZELDEN.

06:35.390 --> 06:36.482
HOW IS SARAH DOING ?

06:36.590 --> 06:38.126
SHE WON'T
RETURN MY CALLS.

06:38.230 --> 06:40.050
SHE'S BECOME BEST FRIENDS
WITH SOMEONE WHO'S VERY FAMOUS,

06:40.160 --> 06:41.718
BUT SHE WON'T TELL ME
WHO IT IS.

06:41.830 --> 06:44.697
ALL SHE'LL SAY IS IT'S SOMEBODY
WHO FUCKED MICHAEL DOUGLAS.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.859
( laughing )

06:46.970 --> 06:50.303
( phone ringing )

06:50.410 --> 06:52.628
OKAY, THIS IS NOT
WHAT I HAD IN MIND

06:52.740 --> 06:56.073
WHEN I SAID I'D SPEND
THE DAY WITH YOU.

06:57.910 --> 06:59.002
EXCUSE ME.

06:59.110 --> 07:01.340
MY FRIEND HAD AN APPOINTMENT
TO GET HER TEETH CLEANED

07:01.450 --> 07:02.439
AT 11 O'CLOCK.

07:02.550 --> 07:03.778
IT'S ALMOST NOON.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.710
OUR TECHNICIAN IS RUNNING
A LITTLE LATE TODAY.

07:05.820 --> 07:08.209
HOW MUCH LONGER,
YOU THINK ?

07:08.320 --> 07:10.857
I CAN'T REALLY SAY.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.349
OH, YOU CAN'T, HUH ?

07:13.460 --> 07:14.950
NO.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.527
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO WAIT YOUR TURN,

07:16.630 --> 07:18.166
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

07:18.270 --> 07:20.295
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?

07:20.400 --> 07:22.163
PATTY.

07:22.270 --> 07:24.830
HI, PATTY,
I'M BETTINA.

07:24.940 --> 07:26.669
I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION
FOR YOU, PATTY.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.270
YES ?

07:28.380 --> 07:29.938
I CAN UNDERSTAND
OUR HAVING TO WAIT.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.870
WHAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND
IS YOUR NEED TO BE

07:31.980 --> 07:34.414
SUCH A CONDESCENDING ASSHOLE
TO SOMEONE WHO IS,

07:34.520 --> 07:36.010
AFTER ALL,
A FELLOW HUMAN BEING.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.712
I DO NOT HAVE TO SIT HERE
AND LISTEN TO THIS--

07:37.820 --> 07:39.344
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU'RE SO SPECIAL ?

07:39.450 --> 07:40.883
BETTINA--

07:40.990 --> 07:42.457
OR ARE YOU JUST PISSED OFF
BECAUSE YOUR LIFE SUCKS ?

07:42.560 --> 07:43.686
I'M SO SORRY.

07:43.790 --> 07:44.688
BECAUSE I HATE TO BREAK
IT TO YOU, HONEY,

07:44.790 --> 07:46.348
BUT IT'S NOT
OUR FAULT !

07:46.460 --> 07:48.348
I'LL CALL
TO RESCHEDULE.

07:48.460 --> 07:51.827
( phone )

07:52.700 --> 07:54.258
DENNIS RECOMMENDED YOU.

07:54.370 --> 07:56.235
FROM CHORUS ?

07:56.340 --> 07:58.205
YES.

07:58.310 --> 07:59.538
I'M A MEMBER, TOO.

07:59.640 --> 08:02.279
I HAVEN'T BEEN VERY ACTIVE
THE PAST YEAR,

08:02.380 --> 08:04.143
SINCE BOB GOT SICK.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.002
IT WASN'T AIDS.

08:06.110 --> 08:09.375
EVEN THOUGH WE BOTH FUCKED
LIKE BUNNIES DURING THE '705.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.812
WE BURIED HALF
OUR FRIENDS.

08:11.920 --> 08:15.048
WE THOUGHT WE'D BEEN SPARED,
AND WE'D GROW OLD TOGETHER.

08:15.160 --> 08:18.220
SUCH HUBRIS.

08:18.330 --> 08:20.525
I'M SO SORRY.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.188
IT WAS CARDIOMYOPATHY.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.427
EN LARGED HEART.

08:24.530 --> 08:26.464
HIS HEART
WAS TOO BIG.

08:26.570 --> 08:28.834
WE USED TO
JOKE ABOUT IT.

08:28.940 --> 08:32.307
IT WAS CAUSED BY A SEVERELY
LEAKING HEART VALVE.

08:32.410 --> 08:35.174
WE USED TO JOKE
ABOUT THAT TOO.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.838
BLEEDING HEART ?

08:36.950 --> 08:41.569
HAVE ANY OTHER MEMBERS
OF HIS FAMILY BEEN CONTACTED ?

08:41.680 --> 08:43.739
I CALLED HIS SISTER
IN PHOENIX,

08:43.850 --> 08:45.647
BUT SHE'S NOT COMING.

08:45.750 --> 08:49.083
HIS FAMILY WAS NEVER
VERY ACCEPTING OF...

08:49.190 --> 08:51.522
THINGS.

08:51.630 --> 08:55.919
BOB AND I WERE TOGETHER
FOR 22 YEARS, SO,

08:56.030 --> 08:57.588
I'M HIS FAMILY.

08:57.700 --> 09:01.238
WE HAVE DURABLE
POWER OF ATTORNEY.

09:01.340 --> 09:03.308
I'LL HAVE OUR LAWYER
FAX IT TO YOU.

09:03.410 --> 09:07.574
I'M SORRY WE HAVE
TO ASK YOU FOR THAT.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.539
I'M A SCENIC DESIGNER

09:13.650 --> 09:15.709
FOR THE LOS ANGELES
LYRIC OPERA.

09:15.820 --> 09:17.788
BOB WAS
THE LIGHTING DESIGNER.

09:17.890 --> 09:21.656
I WAS TOLD THAT
YOU WOULD BE MORE OPEN

09:21.760 --> 09:26.322
TO ACCOMMODATING
CERTAIN REQUESTS.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.562
YOU GOTTA
BE KIDDING ME.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.262
A FUCKING OPERA ?

09:32.370 --> 09:34.964
HE JUST WANTS TO DESIGN A SET
AND RIG SOME SPECIAL LIGHTING.

09:35.070 --> 09:37.163
WELL, HOW LONG IS
THIS GONNA TAKE ?

09:37.270 --> 09:39.204
THEY'RE GONNA NEED
THE SLUMBER ROOM FOR TWO DAYS.

09:39.310 --> 09:40.334
OH, NO WAY.

09:40.440 --> 09:41.998
NO WAY, WE COULD
HAVE THREE FUNERALS.

09:42.110 --> 09:43.509
APPARENTLY HE'S WILLING
TO PAY FOR IT.

09:43.610 --> 09:45.407
FOR A FUCKING OPERA ?

09:45.510 --> 09:46.841
YES, FEDERICO.

09:46.950 --> 09:49.214
HUH.

09:49.320 --> 09:53.586
YOU KNOW, VANESSA'S COUSIN WON
OPERA TICKETS ONCE FROM K.U.S.C.

09:53.690 --> 09:55.783
AND SHE GAVE
THEM TO US.

09:55.890 --> 09:57.983
IT WAS SO
COMPLETELY WHACKED,

09:58.090 --> 10:00.820
THERE WAS LIKE
THIS MAGIC MIRROR,

10:00.930 --> 10:03.728
YOU KNOW,
AND A DEAD SWAN,

10:03.830 --> 10:06.321
AND THIS LIKE
BLEEDING SPEAR--

10:06.430 --> 10:08.068
"PARSIFAL".

10:08.170 --> 10:09.432
YEAH !

10:09.540 --> 10:11.906
AND THEY HAD
THESE FLOWER CHICKS

10:12.010 --> 10:13.807
WHO WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE HOT, YOU KNOW ?

10:13.910 --> 10:15.775
BUT THEY WERE ALL LIKE
MAJOR WIDE LOADS.

10:15.880 --> 10:20.169
AND THESE LAME-ASS KNIGHTS
WHO WERE LIKE PRANCING AROUND,

10:20.280 --> 10:22.885
AND SINGING AT THE TOP
OF THEIR LUNGS, YOU KNOW ?

10:22.990 --> 10:25.413
IT WAS JUST SO,
SO FUCKING--

10:25.520 --> 10:26.612
GAY ?

10:26.720 --> 10:28.483
I WAS GONNA
SAY "STUPID".

10:28.590 --> 10:30.455
BULLSHIT, YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS FUNERAL.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.686
YOU THINK
IT'S TOO GAY.

10:31.790 --> 10:33.428
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I WAS GONNA SAY--

10:33.530 --> 10:34.997
WELL, WE'RE DOING IT
AND THAT'S FINAL.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.829
THESE GUYS WERE
TOGETHER FOR 22 YEARS,

10:36.930 --> 10:40.093
AND WE'RE GOING TO SHOW THEM
THE RESPECT THAT THEY DESERVE.

10:43.170 --> 10:44.660
HEY.

10:51.010 --> 10:53.376
YOU GOTTA
BE KIDDING ME.

10:53.480 --> 10:55.948
YOU'VE NEVER HAD
A MASSAGE BEFORE ?

10:56.050 --> 10:57.745
NO!

10:57.850 --> 11:01.013
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN LIVING,
UNDER A ROCK ?

11:01.120 --> 11:04.829
LIGHTEN UP, SISTER, THIS IS
HER FIRST TIME ON THE TABLE.

11:04.930 --> 11:08.058
OH NO, WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS JUST FINE, DEAR.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.969
( laughing )

11:10.070 --> 11:12.197
NIKOLAI WAS ALWAYS TRYING
TO GET ME TO COME HERE.

11:12.300 --> 11:13.631
SO, WHY DIDN'T YOU ?

11:13.740 --> 11:14.729
I DON'T KNOW.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.068
I WAS AFRAID.

11:16.170 --> 11:17.569
I THINK IF YOU'RE
AFRAID OF SOMETHING ?

11:19.780 --> 11:22.169
I DON'T USUALLY LIKE
BEING TOUCHED BY STRANGERS,

11:22.280 --> 11:24.168
BUT...

11:24.280 --> 11:25.474
THIS IS.

11:25.580 --> 11:27.309
INVIGORATING.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.876
IT'S MANDATORY.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.210
I STARTED GETTING
A MASSAGE EVERY WEEK

11:31.320 --> 11:33.880
AFTER I CAUGHT MY SECOND
HUSBAND CHEATING ON ME.

11:33.990 --> 11:37.255
HEY, I'M NOT
A PORCELAIN BUTTERFLY.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.749
YOU WANT A TIP
OR NOT ?

11:40.460 --> 11:43.065
( sighing )

11:44.700 --> 11:47.396
I CHEATED
ON MY HUSBAND.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.331
NO WAY.

11:49.440 --> 11:50.737
IT'S TRUE.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.660
WITH MY HAIRDRESSER.

11:52.780 --> 11:55.237
HE WAS THE ONE WHO FIRST
TOOK ME HIKING.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.001
WAY TO GO, FISHER.

11:57.110 --> 11:59.749
I CHEATED ON
NUMBER TWO,

11:59.850 --> 12:03.308
BUT ONLY AFTER I KNEW
HE WAS CHEATING ON ME.

12:03.420 --> 12:04.682
WELL, THAT'S FAIR.

12:04.790 --> 12:07.418
I EVEN SLEPT WITH
HIS GASTROENTEROLOGIST.

12:07.520 --> 12:10.421
FOR SOME REASON I THOUGHT
THAT WOULD REALLY HURT HIM,

12:10.530 --> 12:12.748
BUT HE JUST
LAUGHED AT ME.

12:12.860 --> 12:16.193
I WILL ALWAYS
HATE HIM FOR THAT.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.359
ASSHOLE.

12:18.470 --> 12:21.667
I STILL FEEL GUILTY
FOR CHEATING ON NATHANIEL.

12:21.770 --> 12:24.603
HEY, YOU GOTTA
LET GO OF THAT.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.405
IT'S DONE.

12:26.510 --> 12:27.704
MOVE ON.

12:27.810 --> 12:31.473
( gasping )

12:34.450 --> 12:37.146
AHH...

12:45.460 --> 12:49.191
( hammering )

12:53.470 --> 12:54.892
PUT IT IN THERE

12:55.000 --> 12:56.729
AND JUST MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T
LEAN AGAINST THE WALL, OKAY ?

12:56.840 --> 12:58.000
THAN KS.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.135
I THOUGHT PUCCINI
WAS ITALIAN.

13:00.240 --> 13:04.040
HE IS, BUT "TURANDOT"
TAKES PLACE IN CHINA.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.300
HUH.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.514
IT'S BIG.

13:08.620 --> 13:13.455
WELL, KEVIN OBVIOUSLY NEEDS
SOMETHING TO POUR HIMSELF INTO,

13:13.560 --> 13:17.587
TO TAKE HIS MIND OFF SUCH
AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE LOSS.

13:17.690 --> 13:20.193
IT WAS PUCCINI'S
LAST OPERA, YOU KNOW.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.894
HE DIED BEFORE HE GOT
A CHANCE TO FINISH IT.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.460
BOB WAS MUCH MORE OF
A FORMALIST THAN I AM,

13:27.570 --> 13:31.802
BUT I THINK HE
WOULD'VE LIKED IT.

13:34.710 --> 13:38.077
I KNOW HE WOULD
HAVE LIKED THAT.

13:38.180 --> 13:42.617
JESUS, YOU COULD SERVE
BREAKFAST ON THAT ASS.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.188
IF BOB WERE HERE,

13:45.290 --> 13:48.157
HE'D BE ALL OVER THAT BOY
LIKE WHITE ON RICE.

13:48.260 --> 13:51.024
AND I GUARANTEE YOU HE'D HAVE
HIM IN BED BEFORE NIGHTFALL.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.859
I SWEAR,

13:52.960 --> 13:55.758
HE COULD CHARM THE PANTS
OFF OF ANY MAN ALIVE,

13:55.860 --> 13:57.794
AND HE USUALLY DID.

13:57.900 --> 14:00.994
I WAS NEVER AS LUCKY AS
HE WAS IN THAT DEPARTMENT.

14:01.100 --> 14:03.364
BUT AT LEAST
HE LIKED TO SHARE.

14:03.470 --> 14:09.102
ERIC, YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE
SURE THOSE RISERS ARE FLUSH,

14:09.210 --> 14:11.974
ALRIGHT ?

14:12.080 --> 14:15.618
WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY
TO GRIEVE.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.280
HOW DID THEY EVER
LAST 22 YEARS ?

14:18.390 --> 14:20.358
IT'S EASY WHEN
YOU GET TO FUCK

14:20.460 --> 14:22.348
WHOEVER YOU WANT TO
THE WHOLE TIME.

14:22.460 --> 14:23.529
THERE YOU GO.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.484
HAND ME THAT MAKITA.

14:25.590 --> 14:26.625
HERE.

14:26.730 --> 14:29.028
( drilling )

14:29.130 --> 14:31.291
SO, WERE YOU GUYS A COUPLE,
OR JUST HANGING OUT ?

14:31.400 --> 14:33.891
WELL, I THOUGHT
WE WERE A COUPLE, BUT...

14:34.000 --> 14:36.833
HE THOUGHT WE WERE
JUST HANGING OUT.

14:36.940 --> 14:38.862
HE WAS SQUIRRELY,
WASN'T HE ?

14:38.970 --> 14:40.835
YEAH, TOTALLY.

14:40.940 --> 14:43.170
NATE USED
TO BE LIKE THAT.

14:43.280 --> 14:46.647
SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO
HANG IN THERE AND WAIT.

14:46.750 --> 14:48.968
WAIT FOR WHAT ?

14:49.080 --> 14:52.288
FOR THEM
TO GROW UP.

14:52.390 --> 14:57.157
IF I HAD KNOWN HE WAS
GONNA BE SUCH A JERK,

14:57.260 --> 14:59.922
I NEVER WOULD HAVE SLEPT
WITH HIM IN THAT CREMATORIUM.

15:00.030 --> 15:01.292
OKAY, PUT ME
TO WORK.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.992
RUTH, NO,
IT'S YOUR NIGHT OFF.

15:03.100 --> 15:05.159
OH, I MUCH PREFER
TO BE BUSY.

15:05.270 --> 15:06.498
MOM, YOU REALLY
SHOULD'VE TOLD ME

15:06.600 --> 15:08.261
THIS PARTY WAS GONNA
BE SUCH A BIG DEAL.

15:08.370 --> 15:09.735
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL
AT ALL.

15:09.840 --> 15:10.829
I COULD'VE TRIED
TO CHANGE MY PLANS.

15:10.940 --> 15:13.238
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BE HERE ?

15:13.340 --> 15:15.706
NO, I HAVE TO GO TO THIS
GUEST ARTIST LECTURE SERIES.

15:15.810 --> 15:17.107
IT'S SCOTT PHILIP SMITH.

15:17.210 --> 15:19.349
HE'S LIKE THIS
REALLY RADICAL ARTIST

15:19.450 --> 15:21.748
WITH LIKE DEATH THREATS
AGAINST HIM.

15:21.850 --> 15:23.215
HE'S VERY POLITICAL.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.139
CLAIRE.

15:24.250 --> 15:25.649
IT'S YOUR
MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY.

15:25.750 --> 15:26.956
DON'T BE SILLY.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.413
YOU GO AHEAD.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.226
THIS ISN'T GOING
TO BE MY LAST BIRTHDAY.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.025
I'LL TOTALLY
MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

15:32.130 --> 15:34.826
RUTH, WOULD YOU PREFER

15:34.930 --> 15:37.160
CURRIED CHICKPEAS
OR CHICKPEA CROQUETTES ?

15:37.270 --> 15:39.864
OH, CHICKPEAS
GIVE ME GAS.

15:39.970 --> 15:42.894
THIS IS AN UNUSUALLY
GASSY FAMILY.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.432
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ?

15:44.540 --> 15:46.599
I LOVE CHICKPEAS ANYWAY
AND THIS IS MY BIRTHDAY.

15:46.710 --> 15:48.928
SO YOU DECIDE,
YOU'RE THE CHEF.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.201
THAT'S SUCH
A LOVELY DRESS.

15:51.310 --> 15:52.607
THANK YOU.

15:52.710 --> 15:54.439
HERE.

15:54.550 --> 15:57.348
I'D HATE IT IF YOU
GOT SOMETHING ON IT.

15:57.450 --> 15:58.382
OH, TOO LATE.

15:58.490 --> 15:59.889
MAYA SPIT UP ON IT
LAST TIME I WORE IT.

15:59.990 --> 16:01.218
ISN'T THAT FUNNY ?

16:01.320 --> 16:03.754
I THINK ALL MY DRESSES
HAD SPIT UP ON THEM.

16:03.860 --> 16:06.226
THERE YOU GO.

16:06.330 --> 16:08.651
THANK YOU.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.092
HAS THE PARTY
STARTED YET ?

16:11.200 --> 16:14.897
HI, HONEY.
HELLO, DEAR.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.366
ONE, TWO, THREE.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.200
HELLO.

16:23.310 --> 16:26.802
OH, KEVIN NEVER
MENTIONED THIS.

16:26.910 --> 16:29.811
I MEAN, A TONGUE STUD,

16:29.920 --> 16:32.480
I CAN SORT
OF UNDERSTAND,

16:32.590 --> 16:35.115
BUT THIS ?

16:35.220 --> 16:36.983
THAT'S GOTTA HURT.

16:37.090 --> 16:41.424
NOT TO MENTION GETTING IT,
YOU KNOW, INSTALLED.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.590
SO, IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO ENHANCE PLEASURE ?

16:44.700 --> 16:46.122
AND FOR WHO ?

16:46.230 --> 16:48.630
APPARENTLY IT WORKED
FOR QUEEN VICTORIA.

16:48.740 --> 16:50.105
COME AGAIN ?

16:50.210 --> 16:52.030
IT'S CALLED
A PRINCE ALBERT.

16:52.140 --> 16:53.971
SHE LIKED HIM
TO WEAR TIGHT PANTS.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.469
THE RING WAS ATTACHED
BY A STRAP TO HIS THIGH.

16:56.580 --> 16:59.401
THUS ENABLING
A SMOOTH TROUSER LINE.

16:59.510 --> 17:02.570
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ALL THIS STUFF ?

17:02.680 --> 17:04.739
I READ A LOT.

17:04.850 --> 17:09.412
YEAH, RIGHT.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.522
YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN
NOTICING A LOT LATELY ?

17:11.630 --> 17:14.656
A LOT OF GUYS COMING IN
WITH THEIR BALLS SHAVED.

17:14.760 --> 17:17.069
WHAT'S THAT
ALL ABOUT ?

17:17.170 --> 17:20.867
ACTUALLY, IT MAKES THEM
MORE SENSITIVE.

17:20.970 --> 17:24.167
YOU KNOW,
FOR ORAL STIMULATION ?

17:24.270 --> 17:29.298
BESIDES, NO ONE LIKES GETTING
PUBIC HAIR STUCK IN THEIR TEETH.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.744
DO YOU WANT TO ASK ME
IF I SHAVE MY BALLS ?

17:36.850 --> 17:38.841
AH, NO, NOT REALLY.

17:38.950 --> 17:40.611
NO, I'M HAPPY
TO TELL YOU.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.587
I AM AND I DO SHAVE, HAVE TO,
LOT OF HAIR DOWN THERE.

17:43.690 --> 17:44.782
KEITH DOESN'T...

17:44.890 --> 17:45.982
HAVE TO.

17:46.090 --> 17:47.591
ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANT TO KNOW ?

17:47.700 --> 17:48.724
NOW IS THE TIME.

17:48.830 --> 17:51.264
NOPE, I'M GOOD.

17:52.600 --> 17:56.036
IN 1982, RONALD REAGAN'S
DEREGULATION OF

17:56.140 --> 17:58.131
THE NATION'S
MENTAL HOSPITALS

17:58.240 --> 18:00.629
LEI-T THOUSANDS OF FORMER
INPATIENTS HOMELESS.

18:00.740 --> 18:06.201
I BELIEVED THESE
INCAPACITATED VICTIMS OF GREED

18:06.310 --> 18:09.177
DESERVED TO VOICE
THEIR DISSENT, SO.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.816
I SPENT TWO NIGHTS ROAMING
THE STREETS OF NEW YORK CITY

18:10.920 --> 18:12.342
IN THE DEAD
OF WINTER,

18:12.450 --> 18:15.487
ASKING THEM TO WIPE
THEIR ASSES WITH THIS FLAG.

18:15.590 --> 18:17.126
( laughing )

18:17.230 --> 18:19.186
WHEN THIS PIECE
WAS UNVEILED,

18:19.290 --> 18:22.020
A GROUP OF QUOTE
PATRIOTS UNQUOTE,

18:22.130 --> 18:24.860
RIPPED IT FROM THE WALLS
OF THE WHITNEY MUSEUM,

18:24.970 --> 18:27.666
TOOK IT TO THE STREETS
AND BURNED IT.

18:27.770 --> 18:30.364
THAT I WAS ABLE TO MOTIVATE
THESE RIGHT-WING ASSHOLES

18:30.470 --> 18:34.201
INTO ACTUALLY BURNING
AN AMERICAN FLAG.

18:34.310 --> 18:36.107
NOW THIS, THIS IS WHAT
I CONSIDER TO BE

18:36.210 --> 18:38.644
THE HIGHLIGHT
OF MY CAREER.

18:38.750 --> 18:39.944
( laughing )

18:40.050 --> 18:42.109
SO, WHAT'D YOU THINK ?

18:42.220 --> 18:43.642
I THINK
HE'S AMAZING.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.012
AMAZING.

18:46.650 --> 18:49.289
AND SO COMMITTED
TO WHAT HE BELIEVES IN.

18:49.390 --> 18:52.587
HMM, YOU SHOULD
MEET HIM.

18:52.690 --> 18:54.658
COME ON.

18:56.300 --> 19:00.020
STOP HITTING ON MY STUDENTS,
YOU OVERRATED PIECE OF SHIT.

19:00.130 --> 19:02.633
BITE MY ASS,
YOU NAZI PRICK.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.708
( laughing )

19:06.370 --> 19:08.577
SCOTT, I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET CLAIRE FISHER

19:08.680 --> 19:10.079
AND RUSSELL CORWIN,

19:10.180 --> 19:11.909
TWO VERY PROMISING
FI RST-YEARS.

19:12.010 --> 19:14.012
IT'S A REAL HONOR
TO MEET YOU, SIR.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.348
TOTALLY.

19:15.450 --> 19:18.442
DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR
AND GIVE UP NOW.

19:18.550 --> 19:20.552
UNLESS OF COURSE YOU'RE
WILLING TO LIVE AS OUTLAWS,

19:20.660 --> 19:23.629
BECAUSE THIS IS CULTURE WHERE
ART IS NOT ONLY A DIRTY WORD,

19:23.730 --> 19:25.129
IT'S A FUCKING CRIME.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.357
NOW, I'M STARVING,
I'M THIRSTY,

19:27.460 --> 19:29.496
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
I AM YOUR GUEST.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.158
WHY DON'T YOU TWO
JOIN US ?

19:31.270 --> 19:33.067
SERIOUSLY ?

19:33.170 --> 19:36.367
CLAIRE, AN ARTIST NEVER
QUESTIONS HER RIGHT

19:36.470 --> 19:38.665
TO EXPERIENCE EVERYTHING
THE WORLD HAS TO OFFER.

19:38.770 --> 19:40.670
NEVER.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.509
OKAY.

19:42.610 --> 19:45.670
MAYBE WE CAN DO AS MUCH DAMAGE
TONIGHT AS WE DID IN ANTWERP.

19:45.780 --> 19:47.975
I HOPE YOU'VE GOT BETTER
HEALTH INSURANCE THIS TIME.

19:48.080 --> 19:50.048
OKAY, I'M OFFICIALLY
SCARED.

19:50.150 --> 19:52.846
DON'T LET THEM
SEE THAT.

19:52.950 --> 19:54.383
OH, NO, THAT'S MY--

19:54.490 --> 19:56.583
THAT'S THE
GOOD-GOOD CHINA.

19:56.690 --> 19:57.622
YES.

19:57.730 --> 19:58.719
WELL, WE NEVER USE
THE GOOD-GOOD CHINA.

19:58.830 --> 20:00.024
THEN, WHAT'S IT FOR ?

20:00.130 --> 20:02.451
BUT WE HARDLY EVER
USE THE GOOD CHINA.

20:02.560 --> 20:06.223
OH, DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT THIS
BACK AND USE THE GOOD CHINA ?

20:06.330 --> 20:08.833
IF THAT ISN'T THE GOOD CHINA,
THEN WHAT IS IT ?

20:08.940 --> 20:10.498
THE GOOD-GOOD CHINA.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.828
WHAT THE HELL.

20:12.940 --> 20:16.103
LET'S USE THE GOOD-GOOD CHINA
FOR ONCE IN MY LIFETIME !

20:16.210 --> 20:17.575
YIPPEE.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.841
BETTINA, THIS IS
MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW LISA.

20:19.950 --> 20:21.372
HI.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.913
I'VE HEARD
A LOT ABOUT YOU.

20:23.020 --> 20:24.146
OH, DON'T WORRY,
IT'S ALL GOOD.

20:24.250 --> 20:25.740
SHE LIKES YOU
A HELL OF A LOT BETTER

20:25.850 --> 20:27.181
THAN THE ONE
BEFORE YOU.

20:27.290 --> 20:28.882
HEY FISHER,
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

20:28.990 --> 20:31.458
GOODNESS, BETTINA,
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.528
NOW, DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT RETURNING IT, OKAY ?

20:33.630 --> 20:36.428
BECAUSE THERE'S NO RECEIPT,
IF YOU CATCH MY DRIl-T.

20:36.530 --> 20:38.964
OKAY, COME ON, WE NEED
TO MOVE THIS TABLE.

20:39.070 --> 20:39.991
WHY ?

20:40.100 --> 20:41.135
'CAUSE WE'RE
GONNA DANCE.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.298
OH, HEAVENS NO.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.799
WE DON'T DANCE
IN THIS FAMILY.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.901
RUTH FISHER, WE'RE GOING
TO CELEBRATE YOU TONIGHT

20:46.010 --> 20:47.159
WHETHER YOU
LIKE IT OR NOT.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.872
NOW, GO PUT ON
YOUR NEW CLOTHES.

20:48.980 --> 20:51.278
ALRIGHT, THANK YOU.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.416
HELP ME MOVE IT
UP AGAINST THE WINDOW.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.442
UH, DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD
WAIT UNTIL Al-TER DINNER ?

20:55.550 --> 20:57.848
OH HELL HONEY, I'LL BE
TOO WASTED BY THEN.

20:57.950 --> 21:00.418
OH AND I BROUGHT
SOME MUSIC.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.454
I HOPE YOU WEREN'T
PLANNING ON LISTENING

21:02.560 --> 21:04.289
TO THIS LILITH FAIR CRAP
ALL NIGHT LONG.

21:04.390 --> 21:07.325
READY ?
ONE, TWO, THREE.

21:07.430 --> 21:09.796
NO ASSHOLE, BEING AN ARTIST
IS NOT ABOUT BEING RIGHT

21:09.900 --> 21:11.561
ALL THE TIME.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.865
BEING AN ARTIST IS RESIGNING
ONESELF TO A LIFE OF MASOCHISM.

21:13.970 --> 21:15.733
OKAY, OKAY.

21:15.840 --> 21:18.206
JUST ANSWER ME THIS,
WHY ARE YOU AN ARTIST ?

21:18.310 --> 21:19.663
BECAUSE I'M ANGRY.

21:19.770 --> 21:20.771
UGH !

21:20.880 --> 21:22.131
DISGUSTING !

21:22.240 --> 21:23.400
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO BE ANGRY ABOUT ?

21:23.510 --> 21:24.647
YOU AND YOUR
FUCKING GRANTS.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.206
I DON'T USE THAT
GRANT MONEY TO MAKE ART.

21:26.310 --> 21:27.743
I GIVE IT AWAY.

21:27.850 --> 21:29.442
YES, BUT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT
IT WAS YOUR SHIT ON THE FLAG,

21:29.550 --> 21:31.188
BECAUSE YOU WERE TOO FUCKING
SCARED TO ACTUALLY GO THERE !

21:31.290 --> 21:33.952
YOU'RE JUST PISSED BECAUSE YOU
HAVE NOTHING ORIGINAL TO SAY,

21:34.060 --> 21:35.015
YOU NEVER DID !

21:35.120 --> 21:36.257
NO, YOU LATCH
ONTO POLITICS,

21:36.360 --> 21:37.657
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOTHING
ORIGINAL TO SAY !

21:37.760 --> 21:39.227
THERE IS NOTHING
ORIGINAL TO SAY,

21:39.330 --> 21:41.150
IT'S ALL BEEN
SAID BEFORE !

21:41.260 --> 21:42.488
GO TO HOLLYWOOD THEN !

21:42.600 --> 21:44.192
THAT IS SO PATHETIC !

21:44.300 --> 21:45.460
THAT IS SO
FUCKING AMERICAN.

21:45.570 --> 21:48.061
IS THERE ANYTHING
MORE INFURIATING

21:48.170 --> 21:49.660
THAN THE MORAL VANITY
OF EUROTRASH ?

21:49.770 --> 21:52.364
TOI, TU MANGES LA MERDE
DU CUL D'UNE POUFFIASSE,

21:52.470 --> 21:53.334
ESPECE DE CON !

21:53.440 --> 21:54.839
FWAH-DE-FWAH-
DE-FUCK YOU.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.931
LUND DIE SCHEISE EINER HURE
IST BESSERE KUNST,

21:57.040 --> 21:58.268
ALS DU JEMALS
MACHEN KANST !

21:58.380 --> 21:59.677
WELCOME TO EPCOT, KIDS.

21:59.780 --> 22:01.543
I WOULD RIP YOUR DICK OFF
AND FORCE FEED IT TO YOU

22:01.650 --> 22:03.709
IF I DIDN'T THINK YOU
WOULD LIKE IT SO MUCH !

22:03.820 --> 22:05.378
FANTASTIC RAGE !

22:05.490 --> 22:09.449
I SO FUCKING LOVE YOU,
YOU STUPID, BALD PEASANT.

22:09.560 --> 22:13.519
SO PROVE IT,
BUY US ANOTHER ROUND.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.590
AND WHY ARE YOU
AN ARTIST ?

22:19.330 --> 22:21.867
UM, BECAUSE...

22:21.970 --> 22:25.701
BECAUSE I HAVE, UM...

22:25.810 --> 22:27.869
A LOT OF PAIN.

22:27.980 --> 22:30.699
GOOD.

22:30.810 --> 22:32.141
GOOD.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.138
PAIN IS GOOD
FOR AN ARTIST.

22:34.250 --> 22:35.717
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT.

22:35.820 --> 22:38.345
ADOLESCENT ROMANTICISM,
ALL ARTISTS MUST SUFFER.

22:38.450 --> 22:42.284
GOD, YOU ARE
FUCKING BEAUTIFUL !

22:42.390 --> 22:48.693
YOUR SKIN IS LIKE
CARRARA MARBLE.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.765
IS THIS YOUNG MAN
YOUR LOVER ?

22:53.870 --> 22:55.098
NO.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.805
WHY THE HELL NOT ?

22:57.910 --> 23:01.573
MAYBE RUSSELL DOESN'T
THINK SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

23:01.680 --> 23:06.879
I THINK SHE'S
VERY BEAUTIFUL.

23:09.150 --> 23:10.686
AND WHY ARE YOU
AN ARTIST ?

23:10.790 --> 23:15.818
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
A FUCKING CHOICE.

23:15.920 --> 23:21.654
IF I CAN'T CREATE ART,
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.929
ATTA BOY.

23:26.030 --> 23:30.137
WHY DO YOU VALIDATE
THESE INFANTILE NOTIONS ?

23:30.240 --> 23:32.663
I'LL TELL YOU WHY,

23:32.770 --> 23:34.601
BECAUSE YOU WANT THEM
TO LOVE YOU.

23:34.710 --> 23:36.803
BECAUSE I WANT THEM
TO TRUST THEIR OWN VISION.

23:36.910 --> 23:39.572
SOMETHING WHICH YOU HAVE
NONE OF, ARRIVISTE.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.318
AND YOU WANT THEM
TO LOVE YOU.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.648
CAN I GET YOU
ANYTHING ELSE ?

23:42.750 --> 23:44.581
MY FRIEND WILL HAVE
A SHOT OF OUZO

23:44.690 --> 23:46.749
WITH A BIG DOLLOP
OF SHIT IN IT.

23:46.850 --> 23:51.719
( laughing )

23:51.830 --> 23:54.594
AND OUR ROOM OPENED
DIRECTLY OUT ONTO THE POOL.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.998
AND THE DREGS OF HUMANITY,
FROM THE LOOKS OF IT.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.567
THEY COME FOR
THE BREAKFAST BURRITO

24:02.670 --> 24:04.433
AND THE FREE SHUTTLE
TO THE OUTLET MALL.

24:04.540 --> 24:07.134
I'VE NEVER REALLY
UNDERSTOOD THE CONCEPT
OF A BREAKFAST BURRITO.

24:07.240 --> 24:09.629
( laughing )

24:09.740 --> 24:12.106
OKAY, SO WHERE ARE
ALL THE X-RATED ONES ?

24:12.210 --> 24:13.677
YOU LEAVE THOSE
AT HOME ?

24:13.780 --> 24:16.214
YOU GOTTA GO ON THE INTERNET
AND PAY $9.99 A MONTH FOR THOSE.

24:16.320 --> 24:19.187
( laughing )

24:20.620 --> 24:23.316
POOR DAVID ALWAYS LOOKED
SO FUN IN A BATHING SUIT.

24:23.420 --> 24:25.888
I DO NOT LOOK "FUNNY"
IN A BATHING SUIT.

24:25.990 --> 24:28.220
ACTUALLY, YOU DO.

24:28.330 --> 24:30.969
( laughing )

24:31.070 --> 24:32.059
SHE ASLEEP ?

24:32.170 --> 24:33.489
YEAH, FINALLY.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.261
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,
DO NOT LOOK FUNNY.

24:35.370 --> 24:37.235
BETTINA !

24:37.340 --> 24:38.364
WHAT ?

24:38.470 --> 24:39.698
I'M JUST FLIRTING.

24:39.810 --> 24:43.109
YOU'RE BARKING UP
THE WRONG TREE, LADY.

24:43.210 --> 24:45.201
WHO WANTS COFFEE ?

24:45.310 --> 24:46.572
FOR GOD'S SAKE, LISA.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.375
WOULD YOU STOP
WAITING ON US ?

24:48.480 --> 24:49.708
C'MON, SIT DOWN.

24:49.820 --> 24:52.015
YOU DESERVE A BREAK,
AI-TER THAT SCRUMPTIOUS MEAL.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.714
THIS IS DAVID IN FRONT OF
THE GEOFFREY BEENE OUTLET MALL.

24:54.820 --> 24:57.584
OH MY GOD.

24:57.690 --> 24:59.658
NOW, I GET
THE ATTRACTION.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.523
YEAH, HE'S A HOTTIE.

25:01.630 --> 25:04.098
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

25:07.370 --> 25:09.395
HAPPY BIRTH DAY.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.206
OH, DEAR.

25:11.310 --> 25:12.902
YOU REALLY
SHOULDN'T HAVE.

25:13.010 --> 25:14.238
RUTH, SHUT UP.

25:14.340 --> 25:18.674
IT'S JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING
I THOUGHT OF AT THE LAST MINUTE.

25:19.950 --> 25:22.919
"FOR MY MOTHER-IN-LAW
ON HER SPECIAL DAY,

25:23.020 --> 25:28.253
"THIS COUPON IS REDEEMABLE
FOR ONE FREE FOOT MASSAGE.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.726
LOVE, LISA."

25:30.830 --> 25:31.785
NICE.

25:31.890 --> 25:33.699
WHOO !

25:33.800 --> 25:36.598
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE BATH SALTS ?

25:36.700 --> 25:38.565
IT JUST FELT
SO IMPERSONAL.

25:38.670 --> 25:40.365
CAN I HAVE IT NOW ?

25:40.470 --> 25:41.630
YOU WANT IT NOW ?

25:41.740 --> 25:42.593
YES, PLEASE !

25:42.700 --> 25:44.133
I LOVE MASSAGES !

25:44.240 --> 25:45.366
SINCE WHEN ?

25:45.470 --> 25:46.437
SINCE YESTERDAY !

25:46.540 --> 25:47.768
PLEASE ?

25:47.880 --> 25:48.938
YOU WANNA GO
INTO THE SUN PORCH ?

25:49.040 --> 25:50.234
MAYBE IT'LL BE
MORE COMFORTABLE.

25:50.340 --> 25:52.046
( laughing )

25:52.150 --> 25:53.503
C'MON !

25:53.620 --> 25:55.349
MAYBE WE'LL ALL
END UP NAKED.

25:55.450 --> 25:58.442
WELL, I WOULDN'T
BET ON THAT.

25:58.550 --> 26:01.587
DOES THIS PARTY SEEM
A LITTLE WEIRD TO YOU ?

26:01.690 --> 26:03.885
ON A SCALE
OF ONE TO TEN ?

26:03.990 --> 26:07.221
90.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.989
SO, WHAT DO YOU REALLY
THINK OF HIS WORK ?

26:15.100 --> 26:17.091
UM.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.703
I LIKE PARTS OF IT.

26:19.810 --> 26:21.209
NOT REALLY, THOUGH.

26:23.580 --> 26:26.902
IT'S WAY TOO
ON THE NOSE.

26:27.010 --> 26:30.173
GOOD.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.510
BECAUSE EVERY
NASTY THING

26:32.620 --> 26:34.656
I SAID TO HIM EARLIER
WAS THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.115
AND EVERY FLATTERING
THING WAS A LIE.

26:37.220 --> 26:42.192
YOU DIDN'T SAY TOO MUCH
THAT WAS FLATTERING.

26:45.030 --> 26:47.863
YOU ARE A BRILLIANT
ARTIST, CLAIRE.

26:47.970 --> 26:50.905
THE PIECE YOU DID
LAST WEEK IN STUDIO

26:51.010 --> 26:53.831
WAS BETTER THAN ANYTHING SMITH
HAS DONE IN THE LAST 10 YEARS.

26:53.940 --> 26:56.329
REALLY ?

26:56.440 --> 26:59.898
ABSOLUTELY.

27:01.680 --> 27:03.716
BUT YOU, RUSSELL.

27:03.820 --> 27:07.244
YOU'RE GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL
BEYOND YOUR WILDEST DREAMS.

27:07.350 --> 27:10.410
YOU HONESTLY
THINK SO ?

27:10.520 --> 27:13.318
WOULD I LIE
TO YOU ?

27:15.560 --> 27:18.267
BUT WHO GIVES
A FUCK.

27:18.370 --> 27:21.294
THE WORLD IS
GONNA LOVE YOU.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.197
THAT'S WHY,
NO MATTER WHAT,

27:23.300 --> 27:25.109
YOU CANNOT CARE WHAT
OTHER PEOPLE THINK.

27:25.210 --> 27:26.905
I DON'T CARE WHAT
OTHER PEOPLE THINK.

27:27.010 --> 27:29.638
PHONY BALONEY,
CACA SHIT.

27:29.740 --> 27:32.573
EVERYBODY YOUR AGE CARES ABOUT
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK.

27:32.680 --> 27:36.172
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK YOURSELF.

27:38.620 --> 27:40.759
I HAVE TO PEE.

27:48.430 --> 27:50.648
I'M SERIOUS
ABOUT YOU, CLAIRE.

27:50.770 --> 27:54.262
RUSSELL IS GOOD, HE'S GONNA
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY,

27:54.370 --> 27:56.565
BUT YOU...

27:56.670 --> 27:59.969
YOUR TALENT IS EPIC.

28:00.070 --> 28:02.334
IT'S LIKE THE TAIL
OF A COMET.

28:02.440 --> 28:05.648
YOU CAN
CHANGE THE WORLD.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.274
OH, SHUT UP.

28:07.380 --> 28:09.473
OH GOD.

28:09.580 --> 28:12.788
I'M SO ENVIOUS
OF YOU.

28:15.020 --> 28:17.784
YOU SEE THE WORLD
WITH YOUR OWN EYES.

28:17.890 --> 28:20.620
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A RARE
AND PRECIOUS GIl-T THAT IS ?

28:20.730 --> 28:23.699
NO.

28:26.370 --> 28:28.565
AND GOD CREATED BEAUTY

28:28.670 --> 28:32.037
AND THEN HE RETIRED.

28:34.010 --> 28:36.672
PROMISE ME YOU'LL DO
GREAT THINGS IN YOUR LIFE.

28:36.780 --> 28:38.372
NOTHING LESS.

28:38.480 --> 28:39.549
UM--

28:39.650 --> 28:41.345
PROMISE ME !

28:41.450 --> 28:43.315
I PROMISE.

28:43.420 --> 28:45.445
ALRIGHT.

28:45.550 --> 28:49.919
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE AND LEAVE
THAT IMBECILE WITH THE TAB.

29:02.170 --> 29:05.367
OH, MY GOD, THAT FEELS
UNBELIEVABLY GOOD.

29:05.470 --> 29:07.563
I HAVE STRONG HANDS.

29:07.670 --> 29:12.778
OH, RIGHT THERE,
THAT'S THE SPOT.

29:12.880 --> 29:16.475
HOW COME YOU NEVER
GIVE ME A FOOT MASSAGE ?

29:16.580 --> 29:18.514
BECAUSE YOUR
FEET STINK.

29:18.620 --> 29:20.588
THEY DO NOT.

29:20.690 --> 29:23.079
THEY DO, YOU GET THAT
FROM YOUR FATHER.

29:23.190 --> 29:25.420
HOW COME YOU NEVER
GIVE ME A FOOT MASSAGE ?

29:25.530 --> 29:28.988
BECAUSE YOU
NEVER ASK.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.591
THIS IS
REALLY WEIRD.

29:31.700 --> 29:35.466
I JUST REMEMBERED
THIS DREAM I HAD

29:35.570 --> 29:39.939
ABOUT A MONTH AGO,
I GUESS.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.702
I WAS GETTING
A FOOT MASSAGE.

29:42.810 --> 29:45.904
AND I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THAT
I HAVE EXTREMELY TICKLISH FEET.

29:46.010 --> 29:48.171
AND YOU WERE
ALL THERE.

29:48.280 --> 29:50.578
WELL, I MEAN, NOT YOU, BETTINA
AND NOT YOU, KEITH,

29:50.680 --> 29:53.012
NO OFFENSE,
BUT EVERYONE ELSE.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.111
YOU WERE THERE AND LISA
AND DAVID AND CLAIRE,

29:55.220 --> 29:58.621
AND ANYWAY, THERE I AM
GETTING THIS FOOT MASSAGE.

29:58.730 --> 30:00.789
I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHO WAS GIVING IT TO ME.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.049
I THINK IT MAY
HAVE BEEN

30:02.160 --> 30:04.890
I THINK IT MAY
HAVE BEEN DAD ?

30:05.000 --> 30:07.628
OH YEAH,
AND I'M HOLDING MAYA

30:07.730 --> 30:11.507
AND SHE'S REALLY SLIPPERY
AND SHE'S SQUIRMING LIKE A PIG.

30:17.180 --> 30:21.116
( moaning )

30:28.890 --> 30:31.825
AND SHE'S SQUIRMING LIKE
A PIG, AND THEN WHAT ?

30:31.930 --> 30:35.923
I DON'T REMEMBER
THE REST OF IT,

30:36.030 --> 30:37.554
EXCEPT THAT, UH...

30:37.660 --> 30:41.096
I COULD NEVER
FIND MY SHOES.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.532
I READ SOMEWHERE THAT
EVERY PERSON IN YOUR DREAM

30:43.640 --> 30:45.062
IS ACTUALLY YOU.

30:45.170 --> 30:49.038
I'M GONNA GO
CHECK ON THE BABY.

30:50.340 --> 30:53.104
DID YOU KNOW THERE ARE
MORE BONES IN THE FEET

30:53.210 --> 30:55.849
THAN THERE ARE IN THE REST
OF THE ENTIRE BODY ?

30:55.950 --> 30:58.919
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT,
BUT NOW THAT YOU SAY IT,

30:59.020 --> 31:00.885
I TOTALLY
BELIEVE IT.

31:00.990 --> 31:04.881
THANK YOU DEAR,
THAT'S THE NICEST THING

31:04.990 --> 31:07.857
ANYONE'S DONE FOR ME
IN A VERY LONG TIME.

31:07.960 --> 31:09.359
WELL, IT WAS
MY PLEASURE.

31:09.460 --> 31:11.724
IT'S JUST MY LITTLE WAY
OF SAYING THANK YOU

31:11.830 --> 31:13.525
FOR LETTING US
LIVE HERE.

31:13.630 --> 31:14.790
WELL, OF COURSE.

31:14.900 --> 31:17.130
YOU'RE FAMILY.

31:40.630 --> 31:42.848
( laughing )

31:42.960 --> 31:46.623
OKAY, NOBODY
TOUCHES ANYTHING.

31:46.730 --> 31:49.369
I LOVE IT.

31:49.470 --> 31:52.507
OH MY,
IT'S VERY LARGE.

31:52.610 --> 31:55.499
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE
THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA.

31:55.610 --> 31:57.407
SO HAVE I,

31:57.510 --> 31:58.545
WE SHOULD GO !

31:58.650 --> 32:00.106
SO, WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS ?

32:00.210 --> 32:03.213
THE SCENIC DESIGNER FOR
L.A. LYRIC OPERA CREATED THIS

32:03.320 --> 32:05.641
FOR THE FUNERAL
OF HIS LOVER.

32:05.750 --> 32:07.547
UH, IT FIGURES.

32:07.650 --> 32:08.856
WHAT FIGURES ?

32:08.960 --> 32:10.882
ONLY A GAY MAN WOULD
BUILD A FUCKING OPERA SET

32:10.990 --> 32:12.389
FOR HIS LOVER'S
FUNERAL.

32:12.490 --> 32:14.890
I THINK IT CHEAPENS
THEIR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.321
OH, DON'T BE
SUCH A SNOB.

32:17.430 --> 32:19.091
IT'S SWEET.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.724
YOU BETTER BE PREPARED
TO BUILD ME SOMETHING

32:20.830 --> 32:22.434
LIKE THIS WHEN I GO.

32:22.540 --> 32:24.861
OH, WHAT, SOMETHING INVOLVING
STEVE MCQUEEN ON A MOTORCYCLE ?

32:24.970 --> 32:27.609
YEAH, AND AN ENTIRE
P-O-W BARRACKS.

32:27.710 --> 32:29.177
NOW, GET OVER HERE.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.679
WHAT ?

32:30.780 --> 32:33.476
OH, COME ON.

32:33.580 --> 32:34.808
WHY DON'T
YOU LOOSEN UP ?

32:34.920 --> 32:37.070
OH, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

32:37.180 --> 32:40.286
WHAT'D I MISS ?

32:40.390 --> 32:42.187
YOU AND UM,

32:42.290 --> 32:45.054
ME AND LISA ARE GOING
ON VACATION TO CHINA TOGETHER !

32:45.160 --> 32:48.755
ME, ME, ME, ME TOO,
ME TOO, CAN I COME ?

32:48.860 --> 32:50.327
BABY,
ARE YOU DRUNK ?

32:50.430 --> 32:52.921
IT'S OKAY, I HAVE LIKE FOUR DAYS
WORTH OF MILK IN THE FREEZER.

32:53.030 --> 32:56.363
WHY DID YOU
CHANGE YOUR SHIRT ?

32:56.470 --> 32:59.462
I JUST SPILLED SOMETHING
ON THE OTHER ONE.

32:59.570 --> 33:02.630
YOU'RE SUCH A KLUTZ,
BUT YOU'RE MY KLUTZ.

33:02.740 --> 33:07.848
( laughing )

33:07.950 --> 33:09.747
YOU SMELL
LIKE LISTERINE.

33:09.850 --> 33:11.317
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

33:11.420 --> 33:13.638
I'M DYING.

33:13.750 --> 33:15.786
( gasping )

33:15.890 --> 33:19.053
HIS NAME WAS
SIMON RODIA

33:19.160 --> 33:21.196
AND HE SPENT 33 YEARS
WORKING ON THEM.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.029
WHEN HE FELT
THEY WERE FINISHED,

33:23.130 --> 33:25.963
HE GAVE THE DEED
TO HIS HOUSE TO A NEIGHBOR,

33:26.070 --> 33:28.436
PACKED UP
AND MOVED AWAY.

33:28.540 --> 33:29.962
WOW.

33:30.070 --> 33:31.935
THEY'RE AMAZING.

33:32.040 --> 33:33.564
HE PUT EVERYTHING
INTO THEM.

33:33.670 --> 33:36.173
WHATEVER HE'D FIND ON HIS WAY
WALKING TO AND FROM WORK.

33:36.280 --> 33:40.649
STEEL RODS, SEA SHELLS,
POTTERY, GLASS,

33:40.750 --> 33:44.846
OLD BOOTS, CORN COBS.

33:44.950 --> 33:47.009
HE MUST'VE BEEN
OUT OF HIS MIND.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.781
HE WAS
A CONSTRUCTION WORKER.

33:48.890 --> 33:50.380
BUT HE WAS
A REAL ARTIST.

33:50.490 --> 33:56.554
AND ALL REAL ARTISTS
ARE OUT OF THEIR MIND.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.019
YEAH ?

34:00.130 --> 34:01.995
YOU THINK SO ?

34:02.100 --> 34:04.432
LOOK AT OLIVIER
AND SCOTT SMITH.

34:04.540 --> 34:05.700
YEAH.

34:05.810 --> 34:09.371
VAN GOGH
CUT OFF AN EAR.

34:15.720 --> 34:16.971
IT'S SO WEIRD.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.308
WHAT ?

34:18.420 --> 34:20.638
I MEAN, EVERY SINGLE
PERSON AT OUR SCHOOL

34:20.750 --> 34:23.059
THINKS THEY'RE GOING
TO BE SUCCESSFUL, RIGHT ?

34:23.160 --> 34:25.025
OTHERWISE THEY WOULDN'T
EVEN BE DOING THIS.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.051
YEAH.

34:26.160 --> 34:28.094
BUT WHAT
IS SUCCESS ?

34:28.200 --> 34:31.169
IS IT JUST MONEY,
OR FAME,

34:31.270 --> 34:34.068
OR IS IT LIKE
THE CRITICS LOVING YOU,

34:34.170 --> 34:37.890
OR IS IT YOU KNOWING
YOU'VE DONE GOOD WORK,

34:38.000 --> 34:41.208
OR WHAT ?

34:46.610 --> 34:48.817
I MEAN, THIS IS
A FUCKING MASTERPIECE,

34:48.920 --> 34:52.287
BUT MAYBE THE GUY WHO MADE IT
JUST THOUGHT IT WAS SHIT,

34:52.390 --> 34:55.484
AND NOW, NO ONE EVEN
KNOWS HIS NAME.

34:55.590 --> 34:56.716
SIMON RODIA.

34:56.820 --> 34:59.880
GOD.

34:59.990 --> 35:02.959
I FEEL LIKE
SUCH A PHONEY.

35:03.060 --> 35:05.028
WHY, YOU'RE FUCKING
BRILLIANT.

35:05.130 --> 35:08.998
BECAUSE I CAN'T IMAGINE
EVER BEING THIS DEDICATED

35:09.100 --> 35:12.308
OR THIS CONSUMED
BY ANYTHING.

35:12.410 --> 35:14.935
MAYBE YOU JUST HAVEN'T
FOUND WHATEVER IT IS

35:15.040 --> 35:18.168
THAT'S WORTH CUTTING
OFF AN EAR FOR.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.475
I WOULD NEVER CUT OFF
MY FUCKING EAR.

35:20.580 --> 35:22.070
NEVER.

35:22.180 --> 35:25.149
VAN GOGH
DID IT FOR LOVE.

35:25.250 --> 35:28.083
HE DID IT BECAUSE
HE WAS TOTALLY INSANE.

35:28.190 --> 35:30.385
WELL, IT'S ONLY AN EAR.

35:30.490 --> 35:36.326
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE
HE COULDN'T HEAR OUT OF IT.

35:36.430 --> 35:39.319
THERE WAS STILL
A HOLE THE$)

35:46.670 --> 35:47.898
IT'S ALMOST TWO.

35:48.010 --> 35:50.274
OH MY GOD.

35:50.380 --> 35:55.818
I'M NOT EVEN TIRED,
ARE YOU ?

35:59.050 --> 36:00.938
NO.

36:01.050 --> 36:06.625
( train )

36:07.360 --> 36:09.191
* WATCH OUT

36:09.300 --> 36:12.269
* YOU MIGHT GET
WHAT YOU'RE Al-TER *

36:12.370 --> 36:14.065
* COOL BABIES

36:14.170 --> 36:17.765
* STRANGE BUT
NOT A STRANGER *

36:17.870 --> 36:22.273
* I'M AN ORDINARY GIRL

36:22.380 --> 36:25.770
* AND I'M BURNING
DOWN THE HOUSE *

36:25.880 --> 36:28.542
* HOLD TIGHT

36:28.650 --> 36:31.539
* WAIT 'TIL
THIS PARTY'S OVER *

36:31.650 --> 36:33.413
* HOLD TIGHT

36:33.520 --> 36:36.887
* WE'RE GONNA BE IN
FOR SOME NASTY... *

36:46.230 --> 36:49.199
PARTY POOPER.

36:49.300 --> 36:53.031
HOW COME YOU'RE NOT UPSTAIRS
EMBARRASSING YOURSELF

36:53.140 --> 36:55.301
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE ?

36:55.410 --> 36:57.139
I DON'T KNOW, I...

36:57.240 --> 37:02.769
WANTED A LITTLE TIME
TO YOURSELF ?

37:02.880 --> 37:04.745
I KNOW THIS GREAT LITTLE
INDIAN RESTAURANT IN HOLLYWOOD,

37:04.850 --> 37:07.717
THE OWNER'LL GIVE YOU
THE ROOM UPSTAIRS.

37:07.820 --> 37:10.482
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
BURY HIS WIFE FOR FREE.

37:10.590 --> 37:14.924
YEAH, I'M NOT
QUITE THERE YET.

37:15.030 --> 37:16.850
WON'T BE LONG.

37:16.960 --> 37:20.361
YOU'RE A FUNERAL DIRECTOR,
WHICH YOU NEVER WANTED TO BE,

37:20.470 --> 37:22.358
JUST LIKE
YOUR OLD MAN.

37:22.470 --> 37:24.461
YOU MARRIED A WOMAN
THAT YOU KNOCKED UP

37:24.570 --> 37:26.401
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

37:26.510 --> 37:28.137
JUST LIKE
YOUR OLD MAN.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.276
YOU WANT ONE ?

37:30.380 --> 37:33.144
NO THANKS.

37:33.250 --> 37:36.174
SO WHEN YOU WAKE UP,
YOU'RE GONNA THROW AWAY

37:36.280 --> 37:38.009
THAT PACK
YOU ALREADY HAVE ?

37:38.120 --> 37:39.087
PROBABLY.

37:39.190 --> 37:40.680
( laughing )

37:40.790 --> 37:43.156
I'M NOT YOU !

37:43.260 --> 37:45.057
YOU JUST KEEP
TELLING YOURSELF THAT.

37:45.160 --> 37:47.082
I'M NOT SHUT DOWN !

37:47.190 --> 37:50.125
I'M NOT 500 FUCKING
MILLION MILES AWAY !

37:50.230 --> 37:52.118
I HAVEN'T GIVEN UP !

37:52.230 --> 37:56.735
I LOVE MY FAMILY.

38:01.910 --> 38:03.605
BUDDY BOY.

38:03.710 --> 38:05.177
YOU THINK I WOULD'VE
STUCK AROUND

38:05.280 --> 38:07.544
IF I DIDN'T
LOVE MINE ?

38:10.620 --> 38:16.354
( music and chatter)

38:32.010 --> 38:33.466
CHECK THIS OUT.

38:33.570 --> 38:36.368
"AMBIGUOUS FIGURE
BETWEEN CURTAINS"

38:36.480 --> 38:38.903
BY OLIVIER CASTRO-STAAL.

38:39.010 --> 38:41.205
THAT IS SO INTENSE.

38:41.310 --> 38:43.642
IT'S PART OF
THE PERMANENT COLLECTION

38:43.750 --> 38:46.241
OF THE CONTEMPORARY
ARTS CENTER IN CINCINNATI.

38:46.350 --> 38:49.285
IT REMINDS ME OF
FRANCES BACON A LITTLE.

38:49.390 --> 38:52.985
OH MY GOD.

38:53.090 --> 38:56.059
HE WAS ONLY 20
WHEN HE MADE THIS.

38:56.160 --> 38:58.196
THAT MEANS WE HAVE LIKE A YEAR
TO PRODUCE SOMETHING THIS GOOD.

38:58.300 --> 39:02.134
I THINK IT'S REALLY COOL THAT
YOU LIVE IN A FUNERAL HOME.

39:02.240 --> 39:05.107
BELIEVE ME,
IT'S NOT.

39:05.210 --> 39:06.859
ARE YOU KIDDING ?

39:06.970 --> 39:08.870
I'M JEALOUS.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.436
IT'S TOTALLY WEIRD

39:10.540 --> 39:13.577
AND EXCELLENT
AND PERFECT

39:13.680 --> 39:17.116
FOR WHEN THEY WRITE
YOUR BIOGRAPHY.

39:20.690 --> 39:24.729
I'M NOT GAY,
YOU KNOW.

39:24.830 --> 39:27.822
WHAT ?

39:27.930 --> 39:29.124
I'M NOT...

39:29.230 --> 39:30.822
GAY.

39:30.930 --> 39:34.434
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT YOU BEING GAY ?

39:34.540 --> 39:37.566
WELL, YOU THOUGHT I WAS.

39:37.670 --> 39:40.707
MOST PEOPLE
THINK I AM,

39:40.810 --> 39:42.778
BUT I'M NOT.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.768
OKAY.

39:44.880 --> 39:47.974
AND I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT IT IS,

39:48.080 --> 39:50.617
BUT GUYS HIT ON ME
LIKE ALL THE FUCKING TIME.

39:50.720 --> 39:54.110
IT'S PROBABLY
BECAUSE YOU'RE HOT.

39:54.220 --> 39:58.111
YOU THINK I'M HOT ?

39:58.220 --> 40:01.189
I DO.

40:01.290 --> 40:05.693
REALLY ?

40:05.800 --> 40:10.590
BECAUSE USUALLY
I GET A "HE'S CUTE".

40:10.700 --> 40:12.839
NO, YOU'RE WAY
MORE THAN CUTE.

40:12.940 --> 40:16.478
DEFINITELY.
I AM.

40:16.580 --> 40:19.902
SO, YOU DIDN'T
THINK I WAS GAY ?

40:21.680 --> 40:24.148
I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT BE.

40:24.250 --> 40:25.888
WELL, I'M NOT.

40:25.990 --> 40:29.915
I THINK WE'VE JUST
ESTABLISHED THAT.

40:30.020 --> 40:33.080
OKAY.

40:52.180 --> 40:56.947
( music )

41:24.680 --> 41:27.240
I LIT IT EXACTLY
THE WAY BOB WOULD HAVE.

41:28.820 --> 41:32.916
I ALWAYS NEEDED HIS LIGHTING
TO MAKE ME LOOK GOOD.

41:38.190 --> 41:43.958
THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING ME
TODAY IN CELEBRATING BOB'S LIFE.

41:44.060 --> 41:46.062
WE'RE ALL SO LUCKY

41:46.170 --> 41:48.889
TO HAVE EXPERIENCED
THE JOY OF KNOWING HIM.

41:49.000 --> 41:53.403
AND I'M NOT JUST
REFERRING TO

41:53.510 --> 41:56.104
THE JOY OF
KNOWING HIM BIBLICALLY,

41:56.210 --> 41:59.771
ALTHOUGH, A LOT OF YOU HERE
HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT AS WELL.

41:59.880 --> 42:04.214
I KNOW, BECAUSE
I WAS THERE.

42:07.390 --> 42:09.210
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT

42:09.320 --> 42:13.381
I'D BE IN A RELATIONSHIP
AT ALL.

42:13.490 --> 42:18.564
I THOUGHT I DIDN'T
HAVE WHAT IT TAKES.

42:18.670 --> 42:23.369
THAT NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY
LOVE ME ENOUGH TO...

42:23.470 --> 42:28.134
STICK AROUND.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.403
BUT BOB DID.

42:32.510 --> 42:36.378
HE STUCK AROUND.

42:36.480 --> 42:40.280
AND SO DID I.

42:40.390 --> 42:43.655
AND FOR 22 YEARS,

42:43.760 --> 42:47.025
WE SHARED OUR HEARTS,

42:47.130 --> 42:50.224
OUR BODIES,

42:50.330 --> 42:54.767
OUR SOULS.

42:55.970 --> 42:58.268
IT WASN'T
ALWAYS EASY,

42:58.370 --> 43:01.305
AND IT WASN'T
ALWAYS FUN.

43:01.410 --> 43:06.746
BUT IT WAS
ALWAYS WORTH IT.

43:06.850 --> 43:09.774
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID
IN A PREVIOUS LIFE,

43:09.880 --> 43:14.419
BUT TO QUOTE JULIE ANDREWS
AS MARIA VON TRAPP.

43:14.520 --> 43:18.752
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
SOMETHING GOOD.

43:18.860 --> 43:24.355
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN REWARDED
A THOUSANDFOLD IN THIS LIFE.

43:44.580 --> 43:50.086
* NESSUN DORMA

43:50.190 --> 43:55.298
* NESSUN DORMA

43:55.400 --> 44:09.007
* TU PURE, O PRINCIPESSA,
NELLA TUA FREDA STANZA *

44:09.110 --> 44:25.823
* GUARDI LE STELLE CHE TREMANO
D'AMORE E DI SPERANZA *

44:25.930 --> 44:36.135
* MA IL MIO MISTERO
E CHIUSOIN ME *

44:41.040 --> 44:57.150
* NO, NO, SULLA TUA BOCCA
LO DIRO QUANDO LA LUCE *

45:04.600 --> 45:06.625
HOW WAS THE FUNERAL ?

45:06.730 --> 45:09.893
IT WAS PRETTY
GREAT ACTUALLY.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.867
AS FAR AS
FUNERALS GO.

45:12.970 --> 45:15.200
YEAH, I COULD HEAR
THE SINGING FROM HERE.

45:15.310 --> 45:18.279
YEAH, THAT GUY HAD
AN AMAZING VOICE.

45:22.150 --> 45:24.675
DO YOU THINK YOUR MOTHER
HAD FUN LAST NIGHT ?

45:24.790 --> 45:27.611
ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?

45:27.720 --> 45:29.859
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
THAT HAPPY IN...

45:29.960 --> 45:32.281
WELL, MAYBE EVER.

45:32.390 --> 45:36.998
THAT WAS A REALLY GREAT
THING YOU DID, HONEY.

45:37.100 --> 45:40.524
I'M REALLY
PROUD OF YOU.

45:40.630 --> 45:43.531
AND I'M REALLY
PROUD OF US.

45:43.640 --> 45:44.959
FOR WHAT ?

45:45.070 --> 45:47.163
FOR MAKING
THIS WORK.

45:47.270 --> 45:49.602
FOR BEING PRESENT,
FOR SHOWING UP EACH DAY.

45:49.710 --> 45:52.440
FOR BEING COMMITTED
TO BEING A FAMILY.

45:52.550 --> 45:55.439
IS IT THAT
HARD FOR YOU ?

45:55.550 --> 45:57.518
NO, OF COURSE NOT--

45:57.620 --> 45:58.917
I THOUGHT THIS IS
WHAT YOU WANTED.

45:59.020 --> 46:00.612
IT IS WHAT I WANT.

46:00.720 --> 46:01.618
ARE YOU SURE ?

46:01.720 --> 46:02.914
OF COURSE.

46:03.020 --> 46:04.089
I MEAN,
LIKE TOTALLY SURE ?

46:04.190 --> 46:06.727
100% ABSOLUTELY,
NO DOUBTS WHATSOEVER ?

46:06.830 --> 46:11.153
I'M SURE.

46:11.260 --> 46:12.568
OH GOD, NATE.

46:12.670 --> 46:15.389
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
IT TERRIFIES ME.

46:18.100 --> 46:20.432
OH, DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT
BE ABLE TO RUN BY WHOLE FOODS

46:20.540 --> 46:21.700
FOR ME
SOMETIME TONIGHT ?

46:21.810 --> 46:22.834
YEAH, I'LL GO
RIGHT NOW.

46:22.940 --> 46:24.100
YEAH.
YOU WILL ?

46:24.210 --> 46:26.007
THE LIST IS ON THE FRIDGE
IN THE MAIN HOUSE.

46:26.110 --> 46:27.475
OKAY.

46:34.250 --> 46:36.514
I WON'T BE LONG.

46:38.830 --> 46:40.422
So, how do you know
Dennis Mariani ?

46:40.530 --> 46:42.828
When he isn't spray painting
walls or jumping off the pier,

46:42.930 --> 46:44.488
he's president
of Green Earth.

46:44.600 --> 46:46.795
He was one of the founders of
Green Earth in the late '805.

46:46.900 --> 46:49.039
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

46:49.140 --> 46:50.289
AMI?

46:50.400 --> 46:52.231
HOW WAS YOUR DAY ?

46:52.340 --> 46:53.762
IT WAS OKAY.

46:53.870 --> 46:55.770
HOW WAS YOURS ?

46:55.880 --> 46:58.804
YOU KNOW, THE USUAL.

47:01.610 --> 47:05.546
( sobbing )

47:05.650 --> 47:09.188
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG ?

47:16.830 --> 47:19.890
I WANT...

47:20.000 --> 47:24.460
I WANT US TO LAST.

47:26.570 --> 47:29.539
I WANT US
TO STAY TOGETHER.

47:29.640 --> 47:31.779
OKAY.

47:31.880 --> 47:36.647
I JUST WANT IT
TO BE WORTH IT.

47:36.750 --> 47:40.379
OKAY.

47:43.290 --> 47:47.283
( sobbing )

48:04.110 --> 48:05.907
HOW WAS YOUR
BIRTHDAY PARTY ?

48:06.010 --> 48:08.604
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

48:08.710 --> 48:11.508
I THOUGHT IT WAS
GOING TO BE AWFUL,

48:11.620 --> 48:15.556
BUT IT WAS TRULY ONE OF THE
FINEST EVENINGS I EVER SPENT.

48:15.660 --> 48:16.786
WOW.

48:16.890 --> 48:18.209
I'M SORRY
I MISSED IT.

48:18.320 --> 48:19.958
LISA GAVE ME
A FOOT MASSAGE.

48:20.060 --> 48:21.857
IT WAS HEAVENLY.

48:21.960 --> 48:25.669
I GOT A LITTLE TIPSY,
WE DANCED.

48:25.770 --> 48:27.920
OKAY.

48:28.030 --> 48:30.260
I'M REALLY SORRY
I MISSED IT.

48:30.370 --> 48:32.634
I SAVED YOU A PIECE
OF BIRTHDAY CAKE,
IT'S IN THE FRIDGE.

48:32.740 --> 48:34.332
THAN KS.

48:34.440 --> 48:36.533
HOW WAS YOUR GUEST
ARTIST LECTURE ?

48:36.640 --> 48:38.232
OH, IT WAS...

48:38.340 --> 48:43.516
ACTUALLY, IT WAS TRULY
ONE OF THE FINEST EVENINGS

48:43.620 --> 48:45.588
I'VE EVER SPENT.

48:45.690 --> 48:48.511
WE WENT OUT Al-TERWARDS,
ME, RUSSELL AND OUR TEACHER

48:48.620 --> 48:50.554
AND THIS ARTIST, AND.

48:50.660 --> 48:54.380
I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT HAPPENED,
BUT I JUST HAD THIS LIKE GLIMPSE

48:54.490 --> 48:58.119
OF WHAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE,
AND FOR WHATEVER REASON,

48:58.230 --> 49:01.222
THE WORLD JUST SEEMED LIKE
REALLY OPEN AND INTERESTING

49:01.330 --> 49:03.230
AND NOT TOTALLY
SCREWEUP AND...

49:03.340 --> 49:05.069
I DON'T KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW.

49:05.170 --> 49:08.628
I JUST FELT
REALLY HAPPY.

49:15.650 --> 49:18.983
MOM, WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
TO A MUSEUM WITH ME TODAY ?

49:19.090 --> 49:22.116
I WOULD LOVE
NOTHING MORE.

49:22.220 --> 49:24.984
SHOULD I MAKE
LUNCH FIRST ?

49:25.090 --> 49:26.819
NO, LET'S GO OUT.

49:26.930 --> 49:28.283
WE CAN GO
TO NEDDIE'S.

49:28.390 --> 49:30.119
IT'LL BE MY TREAT
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

49:30.230 --> 49:31.595
WELL, THANK YOU,
CLAIRE.

49:31.700 --> 49:34.521
I WAS JUST GONNA PUT
THIS TABLE BACK WHERE IT WAS.

49:34.630 --> 49:35.961
DO YOU WANT ME
TO HELP ?

49:36.070 --> 49:40.632
