on the back of Mateo's head.

What?

00:28.489 --> 00:30.957
Leo, you put that down, mister.

This is why you can't
bring your kids to work.

00:33.260 --> 00:35.128
It's just for a few hours.

I don't know. [Stammers]

16:21.660 --> 16:23.559
I'm sorry, I gotta get these squirrels.

16:23.561 --> 16:25.564
I got so many squirrels, Jonah.

16:25.572 --> 16:26.424
Let... [drill whirring]

16:26.492 --> 16:28.693

16:28.794 --> 16:31.195
[whirring]

16:31.765 --> 16:33.664
Okay. Thank you.

16:36.584 --> 16:38.518
Don't look at me like that.

16:38.586 --> 16:39.654
I know what I did.

16:40.852 --> 16:42.413
["I'm Free" playing over speakers]

16:42.415 --> 16:44.977
<i>â™ª I'm free to do what I want â™ª</i>

16:44.978 --> 16:48.093
<i>â™ª Any old time â™ª</i>

16:48.095 --> 16:50.088
Okay, everybody is
saying something different,

16:50.089 --> 16:51.637
so none of us are gonna leave here

16:51.704 --> 16:54.139
until we figure out what
the hell is going on.

16:54.207 --> 16:56.742
Dad, did you tell Amy to stop
me from going out with Jonah?

16:56.744 --> 16:58.078
What? No.

16:58.244 --> 16:59.311
Amy, is that true?

17:01.781 --> 17:02.627
Uh-huh.

17:02.942 --> 17:05.076
Then w... why did you say he did?

17:05.199 --> 17:07.130
I... [exhales]

17:07.836 --> 17:08.569
I...

17:09.108 --> 17:10.775
I don't have a good answer for that.

17:10.826 --> 17:12.492
Because Glenn said it was because

17:12.492 --> 17:14.660
you're jealous and you
have a crush on me.

17:14.727 --> 17:15.993
I don't... Glenn.

17:16.061 --> 17:18.230
Well, that's what you told me, remember?

17:18.298 --> 17:19.608
You said you were in love with Jonah.

17:19.608 --> 17:20.823
You couldn't stop saying it.

17:20.855 --> 17:21.733
I did not say that.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.102
I would never say that.

17:23.104 --> 17:24.003
He's lying.

17:24.006 --> 17:24.906
She's lying.

17:25.031 --> 17:26.669
She's a sassy little liar.

17:26.705 --> 17:28.632
Yeah, blonde hair? Yeah right.

17:28.633 --> 17:30.030
Her whole head's a lie.

17:30.031 --> 17:31.944
Glenn, everyone knows I dyed my hair...

17:32.011 --> 17:32.790
Okay, enough, enough, enough! Dad.

17:32.791 --> 17:34.680
Look, just tell me the truth.

17:34.747 --> 17:36.215
Are you really meddling again?

17:36.282 --> 17:38.350
It's like your doing everything
you can to push me away.

17:38.418 --> 17:39.102
Well, I g...

17:40.525 --> 17:42.161
honey, I love you so much...

17:42.162 --> 17:44.764
Glenn had nothing to do with it.

17:45.792 --> 17:46.433
Really?

17:46.683 --> 17:49.061
I made up all of that stuff about Jonah

17:49.129 --> 17:49.934
because...

17:50.797 --> 17:51.697
I am jealous.

17:51.764 --> 17:52.983
But Papa Glenn said...

17:52.984 --> 17:55.049
Timur, shut your cake hole!
You're being rude.

17:55.050 --> 17:57.769
I have a little crush on Jonah

17:57.837 --> 18:00.178
so I made up all of those lies.

18:00.179 --> 18:03.774
Glenn is right; I am a sassy
little liar, and I am very sorry.

18:05.612 --> 18:07.538
You think you know people, huh?

18:08.125 --> 18:10.782
It's like you can want
something so badly, but,

18:10.784 --> 18:13.219
you know, sometimes
love just isn't enough.

18:15.088 --> 18:16.488
Sorry. [Soft laugh]

18:16.589 --> 18:17.615
I forget you're children.

18:17.616 --> 18:19.591
Your simple minds can't
imagine what it's like

18:19.659 --> 18:20.659
to have everything you care about

18:20.760 --> 18:22.394
just taken away from you.

18:22.462 --> 18:24.730
One time my mom got a new boyfriend

18:24.797 --> 18:26.560
and they left me at PetSmart.

18:28.768 --> 18:30.102
Okay. [Clears throat]

18:30.170 --> 18:32.237
Only Leo knows what I'm going through.

18:32.239 --> 18:33.916
There are four Jeffs in my class.

18:34.286 --> 18:35.219
Okay, dummy.

18:35.279 --> 18:36.660
There are a lot of Jeffs.

18:38.845 --> 18:40.812
But... you're right.

18:41.302 --> 18:43.082
There are other Jeffs out there.

18:43.603 --> 18:44.636
[exhales]

18:44.884 --> 18:46.556
Out of the mouths of babes.

18:47.487 --> 18:48.353
[exhales]

18:48.452 --> 18:49.645
I think we already
looked down this aisle.

18:49.646 --> 18:51.624
She could be literally anywhere.

18:54.139 --> 18:55.761
You really think she can fit in there?

18:55.828 --> 18:57.696
No, I'm thinking about
buying a new canteen.

18:57.698 --> 18:58.869
I lost my old one.

18:58.870 --> 19:01.115
I can't believe I lost Glenn's child.

19:01.381 --> 19:03.922
Everyone told me I was
too young to have a kid

19:03.923 --> 19:05.046
and this proves it.

19:05.047 --> 19:06.838
<i>Will all Sturgis children</i>

19:06.906 --> 19:08.173
please make their way to Music?

19:08.241 --> 19:09.808

19:10.335 --> 19:11.710
What am I gonna do?

19:12.121 --> 19:13.845
Do... do I give him Harmonica?

19:14.265 --> 19:15.681
She is younger.

19:15.748 --> 19:16.848
That's kind of a better deal actually.

19:16.916 --> 19:19.218

19:24.647 --> 19:28.419
Oh! I knew... I knew we'd find you!

19:29.212 --> 19:29.635
Yes, oh!

19:29.636 --> 19:30.999
Well, technically, I found her.

19:31.000 --> 19:31.848
It was my trap.

19:31.849 --> 19:33.734
Just let her have this one.

19:35.335 --> 19:36.579
It was my trap, though.

19:37.157 --> 19:39.571
Nine, ten... get your stuff.

19:39.672 --> 19:40.454
Uh, ten, 11, 12...

19:40.455 --> 19:41.707
Here's Bobbie Sue.

19:41.774 --> 19:44.643
- Hey.
- I definitely didn't lose her.

19:44.711 --> 19:45.399
Okay, bye.

19:45.399 --> 19:46.248
Oh... okay.

19:47.914 --> 19:50.394
Has everyone got their stuff?
Okay. All right.

19:50.395 --> 19:53.284
So is Jerusha
a big "Lord of the Rings" fan?

19:53.285 --> 19:54.920
Uh, no, this is "Willow."

19:55.021 --> 19:56.855
What's "Lord of the Rings"?

19:56.923 --> 19:58.423
Okay, guys, on three.

19:58.524 --> 19:59.691
One...

19:59.759 --> 20:02.514
I should tell you, I'm giving
Myrtle a ride home later.

20:02.514 --> 20:03.889
I just... I don't want you to fight her.

20:03.890 --> 20:05.764
I know you hate seeing me
with other women.

20:05.864 --> 20:07.758
I didn't press the button. Hold on.

20:08.039 --> 20:10.124
I know you were covering for Glenn.

20:10.637 --> 20:11.770
[sighs] Thank God.

20:11.838 --> 20:13.705
I mean, no offense, but ew.

20:13.773 --> 20:16.259
Uhh, nope. That wasn't good.

20:16.260 --> 20:17.709
I got half of you in the frame,

20:17.777 --> 20:19.611
and the other half are... are out.

20:19.613 --> 20:20.957
So that... that's my fault.

20:20.980 --> 20:22.948
Hey, Jonah, why don't
you come in for one?

20:23.049 --> 20:25.851
You know, just in case you
wind up joining the family.

20:25.918 --> 20:28.287
Um, sure.

20:28.354 --> 20:31.356
Seems wildly premature, but why not?

already look like an elf.

Yeah.

One.

20:51.744 --> 20:52.744
Two.

If you hurt her,

20:54.022 --> 20:57.182
