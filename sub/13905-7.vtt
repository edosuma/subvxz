18:30.840 --> 18:34.720
I mean, we both need more from life
than the average Joe. Or Ben.

18:34.755 --> 18:37.160
That's a cheap shot.
It's the truth.

18:39.320 --> 18:43.920
Because there really is nothing worse
than predictability.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.565
I can't.
You can.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.700
You can do anything you want.

19:06.735 --> 19:08.800
I've never lied to Ben. Never.

19:15.640 --> 19:17.640
Just take me home.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.900
Hannah, I'm really worried about you
now

19:29.935 --> 19:32.160
so just call me when you get this,
please.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.440
No kiss good night?

19:41.400 --> 19:44.360
I think we should just try and be
like good friends.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.880
You best go home, Belle.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Yes.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.240
Shit, Han...
It's OK. I'm fine. I'm fine.

20:09.275 --> 20:11.297
Who's that?
No-one.

20:11.332 --> 20:13.285
Your message scared me.

20:13.320 --> 20:15.800
I freaked out. It was a client.
It was nothing.

20:17.960 --> 20:20.000
This isn't you, Hannah.

20:20.035 --> 20:22.000
Fuck.

20:23.320 --> 20:26.800
Just kiss me, Ben. Please.
Please kiss me. Please.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.080
You OK?
Yeah.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.420
Everything's OK.

20:44.455 --> 20:46.440
Everything's fine.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.160
So, what can I do for you today?

20:54.160 --> 20:56.960
You're really a natural at this
game. You were born for it.

20:56.995 --> 20:59.005
Every decision has consequences.

20:59.040 --> 21:02.565
I love you, Hannah.
I want to build a future with you.

21:02.600 --> 21:06.520
I shouldn't be doing this. You
shouldn't resist what you know you want.

21:06.555 --> 21:08.565
I know what I want. You.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.565
And there's always a day of
reckoning.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.160
It's your decision, Han.
Who do you want to be?
